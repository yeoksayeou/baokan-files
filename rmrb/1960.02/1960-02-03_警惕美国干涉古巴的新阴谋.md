Beware of New U.S. Conspiracy to Interfere in Cuba
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

Recently, the situation in the Caribbean region has become tense again due to the United States' intensified aggressive activities against Cuba. While the U.S. government expresses its non-interference in Cuba's internal affairs and its desire to improve relations with Cuba, it is intensifying its slander and threats against Cuba and is nervously preparing for activities to invade Cuba. As the U.S. "Worker's Weekly" pointed out, the danger of the U.S. interfering in Cuba "in one way or another is greater now than ever before." This situation cannot but attract the attention and vigilance of all peace-loving people.

In the eyes of the U.S. ruling clique, the Cuban revolution does not conform to their wishes. Since the Cuban people overthrew the Batista dictatorship, the United States has never ceased its sinister activities to subvert the Cuban government, from threatening economic blockade and plotting rebellions to using Cuban traitors to attack Cuba, single-mindedly trying to strangle the Cuban revolution. With the continued development of the Cuban revolution, the Cuban government resolutely implemented land reform to abolish the large estate system. This not only directly touched the interests of U.S. monopoly capital owning large estates in Cuba, but also had an increasing impact on other Latin American countries, which made the U.S. ruling clique feel restless. Since the beginning of this year, the U.S. conspiracy to interfere in Cuba has become even more blatant. In early January, the U.S. government issued a threatening note to the Cuban government, demanding that Cuba change its land reform policy. The U.S. propaganda machine also echoed this, threatening to "implement a tough policy" against Cuba. After the U.S.'s unreasonable note was sternly rejected by the Cuban government, the heads of the U.S. government and the U.S. ambassador to Cuba secretly plotted the issue of "how to deal with Cuba." U.S. Vice President Nixon, Secretary of State Herter, and some congressmen publicly expressed their "concern" about the situation in Cuba, "hoping that some situation that would change the situation would appear in Cuba," and that a so-called "free government" would be rebuilt in Cuba. On January 26, Eisenhower again made a statement at a press conference, pushing the responsibility for the deterioration of U.S.-Cuba relations caused by the U.S.'s wanton interference in Cuba's internal affairs onto Cuba; and in a threatening tone, he said that if the "disagreements" between the U.S. and Cuba could not be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, the U.S. would "intend to resolve them through other appropriate international procedures." This means that the U.S. is prepared to use its subservient international organizations to interfere in Cuba. At the same time, the U.S. is stepping up its conspiracy to directly intervene in Cuba by armed force. U.S.-made aircraft taking off from U.S. bases are constantly harassing and bombing Cuban cities and villages. The U.S. Air Force has been continuously conducting low-altitude bombing "exercises" in the Guantanamo area of Cuba. There are also reports that the U.S. is increasing its troops to this naval base. In Honduras, Panama, Dominica, Nicaragua, Haiti, Guatemala, Mexico, Costa Rica, and especially in Miami, USA, the United States is stepping up the organization and training of mercenaries and Cuban rebels. It is clear that U.S. imperialism is waiting for the opportunity to launch an armed invasion of Cuba, suppress the Cuban people, and restore a puppet regime that obeys Washington.

The U.S. now says it will not interfere in Cuba while actively preparing to carry out armed intervention in Cuba, which can only once again expose its hypocrisy, which is only to cover up its despicable methods of aggression. This is just like what the Cuban "Melia" magazine has long revealed: the U.S. is a fierce eagle wearing dove feathers and holding an olive branch composed of prey feathers in its mouth. An editorial in Havana's "Today's Newspaper" pointed out, "The peace that Eisenhower talks about is in fact a lie. The facts from the United States are: aggression, threats of economic blockade, conspiracy to rebel, gathering war criminals, and Nazi mercenaries and Falangists, imperialist lackeys, preparing to attack the Cuban coast... The United States is a great power full of aggression, it ignores the sovereignty of the people of small countries—specifically, the Cuban people. It arrogantly attempts to turn the wheel of history and force us to return to the state of a semi-colonial country under enslavement." The Cuban people, who have already stood up, will neither be deceived by the tricks played by the United States, nor will they be intimidated by the armed aggression of the United States. Cuba's "Combat News" put it well, "The threats from the United States are futile. The Cuban people are vigilant even when they are sleeping." Premier Castro recently once again warned the U.S. interventionists: "The Cuban people are invincible... Any interest group that attempts to oppose the interests of our motherland sees very clearly that what it will face is the struggle of the entire Cuban people." The Cuban people's struggle against U.S. interference and to defend their independence can always count on the support of honest people all over the world. China's 650 million people resolutely oppose all the evil conspiracies of the United States to interfere in Cuba, and firmly believe that the just struggle of the Cuban people will surely be victorious, and the aggressive actions of U.S. imperialism will surely be defeated.

    警惕美国干涉古巴的新阴谋
    本报评论员
    近来，由于美国加紧对古巴的侵略活动，加勒比海地区的局势又紧张起来。美国政府一面表示不干涉古巴内政和希望改善同古巴的关系，一面变本加厉地对古巴进行诽谤和威胁，并且紧张地准备着入侵古巴的活动。正如美国“工人周报”所指出的，美国目前“以这种或那种方式干涉古巴的危险，现在比以往任何时期都大”。这种形势不能不引起一切爱好和平的人民的注意和警惕。
    在美国统治集团看来，古巴的革命是不符合他们的心意的。自古巴人民推翻了巴蒂斯塔独裁政权之日起，美国就没有停止过颠覆古巴政府的罪恶活动，从进行经济封锁的威胁、策划叛乱的阴谋到利用古巴的叛徒对古巴进行袭击，一心要想扼杀古巴的革命。随着古巴革命的继续往前发展，古巴政府坚决实行废除大庄园制度的土地改革，这不仅直接触动了在古巴拥有大地产的美国垄断资本的利益，而且对于其他拉丁美洲国家发生越来越大的影响，这就使得美国统治集团感到坐卧不安。今年以来，美国干涉古巴的阴谋更加露骨。1月初，美国政府就向古巴政府发出了一份威胁性的照会，要古巴改变它的土地改革政策。美国的宣传机器也随声叫嚷，要胁说要对古巴“执行强硬政策”。当美国的无理照会遭到了古巴政府的严词拒绝以后，美国政府的首脑人物和美国驻古巴大使就密谋“如何对付古巴”的问题。美国副总统尼克松、国务卿赫脱和一些议员公开表示对古巴局势感到“忧虑”，“希望在古巴出现某种使情况改变的局面”，要在古巴重建所谓“自由的政府”。1月26日艾森豪威尔又在记者招待会上发表谈话，把由于美国肆意干涉古巴内政而造成的美古两国关系恶化的责任推到古巴的身上；而且以威胁的口吻说，美国同古巴之间的“分歧”如果通过外交谈判达不成协议，美国就“打算通过其他适当的国际程序来解决”。这就是说，美国准备利用它御用的国际组织来对古巴进行干涉。与此同时，美国正加紧进行直接武装干涉古巴的阴谋活动。从美国基地起飞的美制飞机不断袭扰和轰炸古巴的城乡。美国空军连续在古巴关塔那摩地区进行低空投弹“演习”。还有消息说，美国正向这个海军基地增兵。在洪都拉斯、巴拿马、多米尼加、尼加拉瓜、海地、危地马拉、墨西哥、哥斯达黎加，特别是在美国的迈阿密等地，美国加紧组织和训练雇佣兵和古巴的叛乱分子。很明显，美国帝国主义正在等待着时机到来，就向古巴发动武装侵略，镇压古巴人民，恢复听命于华盛顿的傀儡政权。
    美国现在一面说不干涉古巴，一面积极准备对古巴进行武装干涉的做法，只能再一次暴露它满嘴仁义道德，不过是为的掩护它进行侵略的卑鄙手法。这正像古巴的“梅利亚”杂志早就揭穿的，美国是一只披着鸽子羽毛、嘴里衔着用猎获物羽毛组成的橄榄枝的凶鹰。哈瓦那“今日报”的社论指出，“艾森豪威尔口中谈论的和平事实上是谎言。来自美国的事实是：侵略、经济封锁的威胁、叛乱阴谋、纠集战犯、以及纳粹雇佣兵和帝国主义走狗长枪党党徒等准备袭击古巴海岸。……美国是一个富于侵略精神的大国，它无视小国人民——具体的说就是古巴人民的主权。它狂妄地企图扭转历史的车轮和强迫我们重新回到被奴役的半殖民地国家的状态中。”已经站起来了的古巴人民，既不会被美国玩弄的手法所欺骗，更不会被美国的武装侵略所吓倒。古巴“战斗报”说得好，“美国的威胁是徒劳的。古巴人民即使是在睡觉的时候也警戒着。”卡斯特罗总理最近再一次对美国干涉者提出了警告：“古巴人民是不可战胜的。……任何企图反对我们祖国的利益集团都看得很清楚，它所面临的将是全体古巴人民的斗争。”古巴人民反对美国干涉、保卫自己独立的斗争，永远可以指望得到全世界正直人民的支持。中国六亿五千万人民坚决反对美国干涉古巴的一切罪恶阴谋，并且深信古巴人民的正义斗争一定能够胜利，美帝国主义的侵略的勾当一定要遭到失败。
