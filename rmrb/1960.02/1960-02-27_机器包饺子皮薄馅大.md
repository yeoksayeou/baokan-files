In the Dalian Shipyard's employee cafeteria, there is a conspicuous dumpling-making machine. With the flip of a switch, the machine's belts start rotating vertically and horizontally. At this point, one person just needs to load the dumpling filling and feed the kneaded dough continuously into the conveyor belt. With the rhythmic movement of the machine, after pressing the dough, filling, and shaping, dumplings emerge neatly and continuously onto the output track.

Using this machine, 5,420 dumplings can be made in an hour, more than twenty times faster than making them by hand. Dumplings made by the machine are not only faster to produce, but also uniform in size, with thin crusts and large fillings, and are resistant to boiling and do not fall apart easily.

    机器包饺子皮薄馅大
    在大连造船厂职工食堂里，有一台惹人注目的包饺子机器。把电钮一捺，这台包饺子机上下纵横的轮带就开始旋转起来。这时，只要有一个人装上饺子馅，把揉好的面陆续递入转带里，随着机器的有节奏的转动，经过压皮、装馅，那边出口的滚道上就齐刷刷的涌出饺子来。
    用这种机器，一小时可以包五千四百二十个饺子，比用手包快二十多倍。用机器包的饺子不但速度快，而且个头均匀、皮薄馅大，耐煮不碎。
