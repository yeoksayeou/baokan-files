Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 31st - According to the Indian Press Trust: Nepalese Prime Minister Koirala returned to Kathmandu by plane this afternoon after ending his half-month visit to India. At a press conference held in Chandigarh, India, before leaving, he reiterated that no one had invaded the border of Nepal. He also said that Nepal has no border disputes with China.

Someone asked him if he knew about the movement of Chinese troops on the other side of the Nepalese border. He said, "We don't know what is happening on the other side of the border." He also said, "Nepal is not worried about any threat from China."

Referring to the Sino-Indian border issue, he said that he hoped the border dispute between China and India would be resolved soon. He said that his hope is based on the fact that the entire international climate has changed for the better. He said that he could never imagine a war between China and India.

Koirala said that he does not think that India and Nepal will engage in joint defense, because a military alliance is "not only useless, but even worse," especially between two countries that are "great friends." He said that joint defense between India and Nepal is absolutely unnecessary.

Koirala said that Nepal adheres to a neutral policy. "Regarding the Sino-Indian dispute, we are friendly to both countries. We want reconciliation between the two countries." Koirala denied the proposal to convene a conference of Asian countries to discuss the Sino-Indian border dispute. He said that if the scope of this dispute expands and other countries are involved, it will not be beneficial. A reporter asked him what Nepal could do to resolve the Sino-Indian border dispute. Koirala said that Nepal does not want to do anything that would cause difficulties for Nepal's neighbors (China and India).

A reporter asked him if he thought China had "invaded" India. Koirala said: "I don't know... the two countries have differences on certain areas, but these are minor differences."

    尼泊尔首相访印返国后对记者谈话
    尼泊尔和中国没有边界纠纷
    印度和尼泊尔之间绝对不需要共同防御
    新华社新德里31日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道：尼泊尔首相柯依拉腊结束在印度半个月的访问后，今天下午乘飞机返抵加德满都。他在离开印度的昌迪加尔以前举行的记者招待会上重申没有人侵入尼泊尔的边境。他还说，尼泊尔同中国没有边界纠纷。
    有人问他是否知道中国军队在尼泊尔边界另一边调动的消息，他说：“我们不知道边界那边发生了什么事。”他还说，“尼泊尔不担心会有来自中国的任何威胁。”
    谈到中印边界问题时，他说，他希望中印两国之间的边界纠纷很快得到解决。他说，他这种希望是有以下的事实为根据的：整个国际的气候已经朝好的方面变化。他说，他绝不能想像中国和印度之间发生战争。
    柯依拉腊说，他并不认为印度和尼泊尔之间会搞共同防御，因为军事联盟“不仅是没用，而且更坏”，特别是在作为“伟大的朋友”的两个国家之间。他说，印度和尼泊尔之间的共同防御是绝对不需要的。
    柯依拉腊说，尼泊尔信守中立政策。“在中印纠纷方面，我们对两国都是友好的。我们要两国和解。”柯依拉腊否定了召开亚洲国家会议讨论中印边界纠纷的主张。他说，如果这一纠纷的面扩大了，别的国家也牵涉进去了，是没有好处的。有记者问他，尼泊尔在解决中印边界纠纷方面能够作些什么，柯依拉腊说，尼泊尔不愿做任何造成使尼泊尔的邻国（中国和印度）感到困难的事情。
    有记者问他是否认为中国“侵略”了印度，柯依拉腊说：“我不知道……两国对某些地区是存在分歧的，但是这些是次要的分歧。”
