    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 25th. More than eight hundred overseas Chinese who returned to the motherland on the 18th from Indonesia have been properly settled and have successively taken up work or study positions.

    Upon returning to the embrace of the motherland, relevant departments, based on construction needs and the individual's conditions and wishes, arranged places for them to work, study, and live. More than two hundred people were settled at the Yingde Overseas Chinese Farm in Guangdong, more than fifty people were settled at the Changshan Overseas Chinese Farm in Fujian, and some skilled overseas Chinese workers were assigned to work in industrial and mining enterprises in Guangdong Province; more than two hundred overseas Chinese students were assigned to study at the Beijing, Guangzhou, and Fujian Jimei Overseas Chinese Students' Preparatory Schools; a small number of elderly overseas Chinese were settled in overseas Chinese nursing homes to live their remaining years.

    The returning overseas Chinese expressed satisfaction and gratitude for the proper arrangements made by the motherland. Xu Qing, an Indonesian returnee nearly sixty years old, lived overseas for more than thirty years and returned alone this time, being placed in an overseas Chinese nursing home. He said with emotion: "I have lived a life of hardship overseas for decades, but I never thought I would enjoy this blessing in my old age." He repeatedly said, "The motherland is so good!" "Chairman Mao is so good!"

    Most of the returning overseas Chinese and students had already departed in batches from the 21st to the 24th to their new posts. Beijing and Fujian Jimei Overseas Chinese Students' Preparatory Schools specially sent people to Guangzhou to welcome the returning overseas Chinese students. The teachers and students of the Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Students' Preparatory School had already vacated dormitories and prepared beds for the new classmates during the winter vacation. When the overseas Chinese students arrived, everyone from the principal to the entire student body welcomed them with gongs and drums. Many overseas Chinese students said after arriving at the school: "It's like returning to our own home."

    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 25th. Overseas Chinese who returned to Guangzhou on the 18th continue to angrily expose the unreasonable behavior of Indonesian interest groups in obstructing and harassing overseas Chinese returning to China, destroying and seizing overseas Chinese private property, and insulting overseas Chinese.

    Most of these returnees are workers and workers' families. Although many of them returned as a family, the luggage they carried was very simple. Zhong Si, a miner from Bangka Island, said that he had been a tin miner all his life, and his family had grown pepper all their lives, but the half a kilogram of pepper he brought with him this time was confiscated. Wu Youcheng, an old overseas Chinese miner, said that he had worked hard in Indonesia for decades and suffered from overwork, but some "anti-fever pills" he brought back for the journey were also confiscated. Wu Ya'ai, a seventy-seven-year-old man, said that he had worked all his life in Indonesia and now had nothing left but to return barefoot. Indonesian inspectors even took away the three pairs of shoes he brought with him, and he only put on the shoes given by the motherland when he arrived in Shenzhen.

    Liao Hong, a returning overseas Chinese, said that he had worked hard in Buton for thirty-seven years, but even the only bits and pieces he had were detained when he returned home. When he arrived in Shenzhen, he only had one Indonesian rupiah left in his pocket. The overseas Chinese miners who returned with him, Ye Quan, Huang Ping, Yang Yaxin, etc., had their daily necessities such as pens, bicycles, and watches unreasonably detained by the relevant Indonesian authorities; even small amounts of biscuits and milk were not allowed to be taken. A pair of children's shoes and a hat brought by the miner Chen Yawang were also confiscated. He angrily asked, is it possible that after decades of hard work, we can't even bring back a pair of shoes?!

    Indonesian inspectors even prevented overseas Chinese from carrying necessary travel food for infants and did not allow overseas Chinese to bring necessary winter clothes. Gui Qiao Wei Dingxiang said that she had a two-year-old child. Before returning to China, she prepared two small cans of condensed milk for the child, but they were confiscated by Indonesian inspectors. The child had to eat adult food on the boat. Gui Qiao Chen Deji said that all the padded jackets of his family were confiscated. After the ship passed Singapore, they had to put on all the few pieces of single clothing they had, but his child finally caught a cold.

    One overseas Chinese student said that an inspector saw his coat and said: "I like your coat," and detained his coat. Many overseas Chinese pointed out that the inspectors, regardless of the weather turning cold after the ship passed Singapore, did not allow overseas Chinese to bring enough warm clothes, which was really unreasonable!

    The returning overseas Chinese also angrily exposed that Indonesian inspectors used inspections as a pretext to insult the overseas Chinese personally. Some Indonesian inspectors even shamelessly molested and insulted overseas Chinese female students. These situations particularly aroused everyone's indignation.

    祖国热情接待归国侨胞
    八百多名印度尼西亚归侨一到祖国立即走上生产学习岗位
    归侨愤慨揭露印度尼西亚有势力集团的刁难行为
    新华社广州25日电　18日回到祖国的八百多名印度尼西亚华侨，已经妥善安置完毕，陆续走上工作或学习岗位。
    这批归侨一回到祖国怀抱，有关部门就根据建设需要和个人的条件和志愿。为他们安排工作、学习和生活的场所。有两百多人安置到广东英德华侨农场，五十多人安置到福建常山华侨农场，一部分有技术的归侨工人安置在广东省的工矿企业工作；有两百多名归侨学生分别安置到北京、广州和福建集美归国华侨学生中等补习学校学习；少数年老的归侨则安置到华侨敬老院养老。
    归侨们对祖国的妥善安置表示满意和感激。年近六十岁的印度尼西亚归侨许青，在海外生活了三十多年，今天单身归来，被安置到华侨敬老院养老。他感动地对人说：
  “我在海外过了几十年辛酸的生活，想不到晚年能享这个福。”他连连地说，“祖国真好！”“毛主席真好！”
    大部分归侨和归侨学生，已经在21日到24日分批动身前往新的岗位。北京、福建集美归国华侨学生中等补习学校，都特地派人到广州迎接归侨学生。广州归国华侨学生中等补习学校的师生，早在寒假期间就为新同学腾出宿舍，准备床铺。归侨学生到达时，从校长到全校学生，敲锣打鼓地欢迎。许多归侨学生到学校后说：“像回到了自己的家一样。”
    新华社广州25日电　18日回到广州的侨胞，继续愤慨地揭露印度尼西亚有势力集团阻挠、刁难华侨回国，破坏、夺取华侨私人财物，侮辱华侨的无理行为。
    这批归侨大多数是工人和工人眷属。他们中的许多人虽然都是举家回国，但所带的行李却十分简单。邦加岛矿工钟四说，他在当地当了一辈子锡矿矿工，他的家属种了一辈子胡椒，但这次他带的半公斤胡椒却被没收了。华侨老矿工吴有成说，他在印度尼西亚辛勤劳动了几十年，积劳成疾，回国时带了一些旅途备用的“发冷丸”药也被没收了。七十七岁的老人吴亚爱说，他在印度尼西亚劳动了一生，到现在，只落得赤着脚回来。印度尼西亚检查人员甚至把他带的三双鞋子也拿走了，到了深圳才穿上了祖国给的鞋。
    归国侨华廖洪说，他在勿洞做了三十七年苦工，回国时却连仅有一点零星杂物也被扣留。到达深圳时，袋里只剩下一个印度尼西亚盾。和他一起回来的华侨矿工叶权、黄平、杨亚新等携带的日用的钢笔、自行车、手表等全被印度尼西亚有关当局无理扣留；甚至少量的饼干、牛奶也不许带。矿工陈亚旺带的一双童鞋、一顶帽子也被扣下。他愤慨地问道，难道我们辛勤劳动几十年，连一双鞋子都不能带回吗？！
    印度尼西亚检查人员甚至不让华侨为婴儿携带必要的旅途食品，不让华侨带必需的御寒衣服。归侨魏丁香说，她有一个两岁的孩子，回国前，她为孩子准备了两小罐炼乳，却被印度尼西亚检查人员没收了。孩子在船上不得不吃成人的饭食。归侨陈德记说，他一家人的夹袄全被没收，当轮船驶过新加坡后，他们只得把仅有的几件单衣全部穿上，但他的孩子终于冻病了。
    一位华侨学生说，一个检查人员看到他的一件大衣后说：“我喜欢你这件大衣。”就把他的大衣扣下了。许多归侨都指出，检查人员不顾船过新加坡后天气转冷的情况，不让华侨带上足够御寒的衣服，真正没有道理！
    归侨们还愤怒地揭露印度尼西亚检查人员借检查为名对华侨进行人身侮辱。有些印度尼西亚检查人员竟无耻地调戏侮辱华侨女学生。这些情况特别引起了大家的愤慨。
