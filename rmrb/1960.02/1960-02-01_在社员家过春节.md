	Spending the Spring Festival at a Commune Member's Home
	By our reporters Li Jinting and Hua Zhigao
	In Wangyue People's Commune, Changsha County, Hunan Province—the "Land of Pig Raising"—reporters spent the second extraordinary Spring Festival since communization with the commune member Huang Meisheng and his family.

	A Clean Welcome to the New Year
	On the eve of the Spring Festival, the commune was on holiday, and Huang Meisheng’s home was filled with festive joy. Huang Meisheng’s wife, Xu Shuhui, was busy cleaning the house early in the morning, wiping tables and chairs. All four rooms were tidied up neatly. She and her children and grandchildren at home put on new clothes, replaced the old Mao Zedong portrait hanging in the center of the main room with a new one, and pasted new Spring Festival couplets on both sides. The upper scroll read: “Live the New Year diligently, thriftily, and joyfully”; the lower scroll read: “Production is red before and after the festival.” She also carefully posted all the award certificates of her husband, sons, daughters, and daughters-in-law, scrutinizing them again and again, her face full of smiles.

	The old woman had just finished tidying up the room when her second son, Huang Jinshan, who works in the commune's supply and marketing cooperative, and her second daughter-in-law, Peng Xiuying, who works as a seamstress in the commune's joint factory, returned with their child. Huang Deyuan, the eldest daughter who works as an accountant in the commune's production team's public canteen, also returned with her little grandson. Immediately, the house became lively. Soon, Huang Guishan, the eldest son who is a production team leader in the papermaking workshop of the Tianlun Paper Mill in Changsha City, also returned. He bought two bottles of wine and "New Year's goods" such as biscuits, peanuts, New Year cake, and cuttlefish, and also brought back Arhat heads, wooden swords, and other New Year's gifts for his younger siblings and children. The children were very happy to see these gifts, some danced wearing Arhat heads, and some brandished large knives to perform plays. The whole family was filled with joy. At this time, fourteen of the family's sixteen members had arrived. The other two were Huang Shoushan, the third son, and Huang Meisheng himself. At the end of 1958, Huang Shoushan passed the examination and entered the Xiangtan Iron and Steel Company—the largest iron and steel complex in Hunan Province, which was under construction—as an apprentice. He is now studying at Anshan Iron and Steel and has become a level-two worker. He recently sent a message saying that he would spend the Spring Festival on the production front this year, to study technology hard, and strive to return to Hunan to participate in steelmaking as soon as possible. He would not be coming home during the Spring Festival holiday. Before liberation, Huang Meisheng had no roof over his head or land under his feet. He had worked for landlords since he was eleven years old, working as a long-term farmhand for thirty-three years. Driven by poverty, he had suffered from mental illness. After the land reform, he was allocated housing and land, and his madness was cured without treatment. After the land reform, he took the lead in forming mutual aid teams and served as the team leader. After the establishment of elementary and advanced agricultural cooperatives, the masses elected him as the director of the cooperative. Now, he serves as the director of the commune's second pig farm and has been named an outstanding model of the commune three times in a row. People call him "Old Activist." The farm was particularly busy in the days before the Spring Festival, and on "New Year's Eve," he was still running around the various pig farms and had not returned home.

	Communal "Reunion Dinner" at the Canteen
	In the evening, the commune's electric lights were lit. The sounds of firecrackers and drums rose one after another. The commune's broadcasting station broadcast melodious songs. The public canteen had already prepared a sumptuous "reunion dinner" for the commune members, with wine, braised pork, beef, fish, and Hunan vermicelli with shredded meat on every table. Commune members, chatting and laughing, brought their children and arrived at the canteen one after another. Each family gathered around a table, full of joy. Huang Meisheng also rushed home from the pig farm, and his entire family, old and young, filled two tables. During the meal, the old man placed pieces of fat pork into the children's bowls, the young people toasted the old people, and the secretary of the Party general branch of the production brigade also raised his glass and toasted the commune members. He said enthusiastically, "One glass of wine celebrates the great victory of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture in 1959; two glasses of wine wish the commune members soaring energy to overcome difficulties; three glasses of wine wish for a red start in production this year, with everyone striving to be the best." The commune members also stood up together and drank three glasses to the health of Chairman Mao. People played guessing games, chatted, and laughed, each with food in their mouths, warmth in their hearts, and smiles on their faces.

	After the "reunion dinner," the production brigade held a cultural performance in the canteen. At the beginning, the radio broadcast the Spring Festival greetings and entertainment programs from the Changsha County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Wangyue Commune Party Committee to the commune members, and the commune members were all excited about the happy life brought by the Party. At the meeting, the commune members also watched the programs performed by themselves. After the party, the commune members went home with great interest, adding fuel to the "reunion fire" and gathering around the stove to "stay up late" and talk about family matters.

	The Whole Family Bids Farewell to the Old Year Around the Stove
	At Huang Meisheng's house, a pot of burning charcoal fire had been prepared long ago. On a table, there were more than ten kinds of things such as candy, biscuits, peanuts, and fried beans, as well as tea and cigarettes. The family returned home and sat around the brazier, chatting heartily about family matters. Huang Meisheng's two brothers, the director of the Commune Party Committee Office, and the Party General Branch Secretary of Wangyue Brigade also came here to "stay up late" with them. The General Branch Secretary joked to everyone: The Huang Meisheng family has iron and steel workers, papermakers, sewing workers, as well as farmers, militiamen, commercial workers, canteen accountants, and students studying in junior high school and elementary school, truly including the "whole family portrait" of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers! There are Party members, League members, Young Pioneers, and labor models in the family, truly a "whole family red"! In this kind of occasion, the children are the most lovable. Huang Meisheng and his wife smiled, busy putting candy in one child's mouth and distributing peanuts and biscuits to another. The six grandchildren were all wearing colorful new cotton clothes, and the three younger ones were wearing red satin hats with white rabbit fur trim, their faces were red and chubby, each looking like a big apple. Everyone wanted the children to sing a song, and the first song sung in clear and loud childish voices was: "The people's commune is good, a happy life is guaranteed...". After everyone applauded, the children sang: "The people's commune is big, doing things for everyone...". Everyone laughed along, praising: The people's commune is good, it's good to sing it this way, and it's also good to sing it that way, the benefits of the people's commune, you can never finish singing!

	The children's singing naturally led everyone's topic to the people's commune. Huang Meisheng spoke first. He said: The first major event after communization is water conservancy construction. In 1959, the entire commune built eleven reservoirs, more than double the number in 1958, and they were all large-scale projects. Huang Meisheng's eldest daughter then spoke about the second major event after communization: the great development of pig raising. She said that in the days of the advanced cooperative, it was not easy to build a pig farm that could accommodate one hundred pigs; but now, pig farms with thousands of pigs are not uncommon. Also, there's no need to cut feed by hand, machines can do the work of hundreds of knives... Peng Xiuying, the second daughter-in-law who works in the commune's joint factory, spoke of the third major event: the great development of commune industry. She said that the commune has machine factories, joint factories, Xiang embroidery factories, Xiang vermicelli factories, paper mills, and lime factories, truly too many to count. At this point, everyone started talking at once. Some said that the commune's roads are accessible in all directions, and transportation is all by vehicles, with tractors and trucks, which should also be counted as one; some said that the commune will hold a 10,000-person mobilization meeting the day after tomorrow to plant seedless tangerines on a large scale, isn't this something that was impossible and unthinkable in the past... You said one thing, I said another, everyone's happy mood was truly endless.

	The sound of firecrackers gradually decreased, and the rooster in the backyard began to crow. The great reunion of the happy family made Huang Meisheng happy and forgot his fatigue. But an even more important thing was firmly in his mind: the dozens of piglets that had just entered the farm on New Year's Eve were crowding together because they were unfamiliar with the place, he wondered how they were sleeping. When the family was preparing to rest, Huang Meisheng himself went to his beloved pig farm again!

    在社员家过春节
    本报记者　李进挺　华志高
    在养猪之乡——湖南省长沙县望岳人民公社里，记者和社员黄梅生一家，欢度了公社化后第二个不平凡的春节。
    干干净净迎新春
    春节前夕，公社里休假，黄梅生的家里充满了节日的欢乐。黄梅生的爱人徐淑辉一早就忙着打扫房子，擦洗桌椅，四间房屋都打扫得整齐干净，她和在家的儿女、孙子穿起新衣，在堂屋中央的壁上换挂了一张新的毛主席画像，两旁贴着一幅新的春联。上联是：“勤俭愉快度新春”；下联是：“节前节后生产红。”她又把丈夫、儿子、女儿、媳妇的奖状一一贴挂好，端详了又端详，脸上堆满了微笑。
    老人家刚把房里收拾好，在公社供销部工作的二儿子黄金山和在公社联合工厂当缝纫工的二媳妇彭秀英抱着孩子回来了；在公社生产队公共食堂当会计的大女儿黄德元，也抱着小外孙回来了。顿时，家里欢闹起来。过了不久，在长沙市天伦造纸厂造纸车间当生产班长的大儿子黄贵山也回来了，他买回两瓶酒和饼干、花生米、年糕、墨鱼等“年货”，还给弟妹和孩子们带回了罗汉头、木刀等新年礼物。孩子们看到这些礼物，都非常高兴，有的戴上罗汉头跳舞，有的挥舞着大刀演戏，全家喜气洋洋。这时，全家十六口人，已经到了十四个。还有两个人，一个是三儿子黄寿山，另外一个就是黄梅生本人。黄寿山在1958年年底，考进正在兴建的湖南省最大的钢铁联合企业——湘潭钢铁公司当学徒，现在在鞍钢学习，已成了二级工人。最近托人带信回来，说他今年要在生产战线上过春节，要好好学习技术，争取早日回到湖南参加炼钢，春节假期期间不回家了。黄梅生在解放前，上无片瓦，下无寸土，十一岁起就给地主干活，一直当了三十三年长工。为贫困所逼，曾患过神经病。土地改革后，分了房，又分了田，他的疯癫症也不治而愈了。土地改革后，他带头组成互助组，担任互助组长；成立初级和高级农业社后，群众又选他当社长；现在，他担任公社第二肥猪场场长，一连三次被评为公社的特等模范。人们都称他为“老积极”。春节前几天，场内分外忙，到“大年三十”了，他还奔走在各个猪场，没有回来。
    食堂共进“团年饭”
    傍晚，公社的电灯亮了。爆竹声、锣鼓声，此起彼伏。公社广播站，播送出悠扬的歌曲。公共食堂早为社员备好了丰盛的“团年饭”，每桌都有酒、有扣肉，牛肉，鱼，湘粉烩肉丝等。社员们有说有笑的，带着孩子，陆陆续续地来到食堂。各家各户都团聚一席，欢乐异常。黄梅生也从猪场赶回家来，他们全家老小，坐满两桌。席间，老人往小孩碗里夹添肥美的猪肉，青年人向老人敬酒祝贺，生产大队的党总支书记也举着杯，为社员敬酒，他热情地说：“一杯酒庆1959年工农业大跃进的伟大胜利；二杯酒祝社员干劲冲天，战胜了困难；三杯酒祝今年生产开门红，人人争上游。”社员们也一同起立，为毛主席健康干了三杯酒。人们猜拳行令，有说有笑，个个都是吃在嘴里，暖在心里，笑在脸上。
    “团年饭”后，生产大队在食堂举行了文娱晚会。开始，广播喇叭传来了中共长沙县委、望岳公社党委给社员的春节贺词和文艺节目，社员们都为党带给的幸福生活而激动。会上，社员们还观赏了自己演出的节目。晚会后，社员们又兴致勃勃地各自回家，加旺了“团年火”，围炉“守岁”叙家常。
    閤家炉前辞旧岁
    黄梅生家里，早烧着了一盆熊熊的炭火。一张桌子上，摆着糖果、饼干、花生、炒豆十多样东西，有茶又有烟。一家人回到家里，围坐在火盆四周，畅心叙起家常来。黄梅生的两个兄弟、公社党委办公室主任和望岳大队党总支书记，也来到了这里，和他们一同“守岁”。总支书记对着大家，打趣地说：黄梅生家有钢铁、造纸、缝纫工人，还有农民，民兵，商业工作者，食堂的会计，也有在初中和小学读书的学生，真是包括了工农商学兵的“全家福”！家里有党员，团员，还有少先队员和劳动模范，真是“全家红”！在这种场合里，孩子们最逗人喜爱。黄梅生老两口笑迷迷地，忙着向这个孩子的嘴里送糖，给那个孩子分花生米和饼干。六个孙儿都穿着花花绿绿的新棉衣，三个小的都戴着白兔皮镶边的红缎帽子，脸蛋又红又胖，个个都像大苹果。大伙要孩子们唱个歌，清脆响亮的童音唱出的第一支歌是：“人民公社好，幸福生活有保障……”。大家鼓掌后，孩子们又唱的是“人民公社大，办事为大家……”。大家随声一阵欢笑，赞扬说：人民公社就是好，这样唱是好，那样唱也是好，人民公社的好处，怎么唱也唱不完！
    孩子的歌声，很自然地把大家的话题引到了人民公社。黄梅生先开口。他说：公社化后头一件大事要数修水利。1959年全社修了十一座水库，比1958年增加了一倍多，而且都是大家伙。黄梅生的大女儿，接着说出了公社化后的第二件大事：生猪大发展。她说高级社的时候，建个容纳一百头猪的猪场就不简单；可是现在，千头猪场也不稀奇。还有切饲料不用手，机器能顶百把刀……。在公社联合工厂工作的二媳妇彭秀英，说出第三件大事：公社工业大发展。她说公社有机械厂、联合工厂、湘绣厂、湘粉厂、造纸厂、石灰厂，真是多得说不完数不清。话到这里，大家七嘴八舌地说起来。有的说公社公路四通八达，运输全用车子，又有拖拉机、又有载重汽车，也应该算是一条；有的说，公社后天就开万人出师大会，大种无核蜜桔，这不也是过去根本办不到和想不到的吗……。你一言，我一语，大家的喜悦心情，真是说不完，谈不尽。
    鞭炮声逐渐减少，后院的雄鸡开始报晓。幸福家庭的大团圆，使黄梅生高兴得忘了疲倦。但一件更要紧的事情，却牢记在他的心头：旧历除夕刚进场的几十头小猪，因为认生尽在一块挤，不知道睡得怎么样？当家人们准备休息的时候，黄梅生自己又奔向他心爱的猪场去了！
