To Do More Good Deeds for People of All Ethnic Groups in Xinjiang
The Production and Construction Corps Vigorously Supports Brotherly Ethnic Groups in Developing Production

(Our dispatch) Since the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps launched the "Do More Good Deeds for People of All Ethnic Groups in Xinjiang" campaign in 1959, it has made great achievements and further strengthened the close unity among all ethnic groups. At present, the leading organs of the Production Corps and its affiliated farms are continuing to carry out this campaign in depth, in conjunction with the Spring Festival support-the-government and cherish-the-people activities.

In 1959, while actively developing production, the farms of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps generally carried out the "Do More Good Deeds for People of All Ethnic Groups in Xinjiang" campaign. According to the situation of insufficient labor in the People's Communes, the farms transferred a large number of agricultural machinery and labor to cultivate, sow, and harvest 376,000 mu for the communes near the farms and supplied 1.5 million jin of improved seeds. During the summer harvest, the reclamation areas transferred approximately 50% of the harvesting machinery from the wheat fields being harvested to help 31 people's communes in 28 counties harvest more than 78,000 mu of wheat. In order to help the communes expand production, the Ili Reclamation Area dispatched exploration and design teams to complete the planning and design of 120,000 mu of farmland and more than 150 kilometers of canal systems for Yining County, Xinyuan County, and Qapqal Xibe Autonomous County.

While helping the communes develop production, the farms also helped the people's communes run welfare undertakings such as schools, nurseries, and public canteens. In the Bostank grassland in the western Junggar Basin, in the past, due to the scattered living of herdsmen, most of them lived a nomadic life and there was no school. In September last year, the Usu Reclamation Area built the first ethnic primary school for the herdsmen on the grassland. Now, the children of the Kazakh and Mongolian herdsmen on the grassland are all attending school here. The medical staff of the farms also regularly treat the farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups. Last year, the entire corps treated more than 210,000 people of all ethnic groups. In order to facilitate the consultation of patients who came from afar, the Ili Reclamation Area Hospital did not rest on holidays, provided consultations upon arrival, and often transfused their own fresh blood to the patients.

This year, the Production and Construction Corps will continue to carry out the campaign to do good things for the people of all ethnic groups. At present, the farms are stepping up preparations for spring plowing and carrying out large-scale farmland water conservancy construction; at the same time, they are allocating forces to help the nearby people's communes repair tractors and various agricultural implements, and train various technical personnel. The ten farms in the Urumqi Reclamation Area are training 500 tractor drivers for the Qitai, Mulei Kazakh Autonomous County, Fukang, Hutubi, and other counties' people's communes in the Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture. In terms of water conservancy construction, the production troops stationed in the Ili area are building the largest Ili River south bank canal water diversion project in Xinjiang. After the completion of this project, it will not only enable the troops to expand the cultivated area by 2.9 million mu, but also increase the irrigated area by more than 1.4 million mu and improve the irrigated area by more than 400,000 mu in Gongliu County and Qapqal Xibe Autonomous County.

    为新疆各族人民多办好事
    生产建设兵团大力支援兄弟民族发展生产
    本报讯　新疆生产建设兵团在1959年开展“为新疆各族人民多办好事”运动以来，作出了很大成绩，进一步加强了各民族之间的亲密团结。目前，生产兵团领导机关及所属各农场正结合春节拥政爱民活动，继续深入开展这一运动。
    1959年，新疆生产建设兵团各农场在积极发展生产的同时，普遍开展了“为新疆各族人民多办好事”的运动。各农场根据人民公社劳力不足的情况，抽调了大批农业机械和劳力为农场附近公社代耕、代播、代收面积达三十七万六千多亩，并且供应良种一百五十万斤。夏收期间，各垦区从正在收割的麦田里抽调了大约50％的收割机械，帮助二十八个县的三十一个人民公社收割小麦达七万八千多亩。为了帮助公社扩大生产，伊犁垦区派出了勘探设计队，为伊宁县、新源县和察布查尔锡伯族自治县完成了十二万亩农田和一百五十多公里渠系的规划设计。
    各农场在帮助公社发展生产的同时，还帮助人民公社举办学校、托儿所和公共食堂等福利事业。在准噶尔盆地西部博斯腾克草原上，过去由于牧民居住分散，大部过着游牧生活，没有一所学校。去年9月，乌苏垦区为牧民在草原上修建了第一所民族小学，现在，草原上的哥萨克族和蒙古族牧民的子弟都在这里上了学。各农场的医务工作人员还经常为各族农牧民治病。去年，全兵团为各族人民治病达二十一万多人次。伊犁垦区医院为便利远道来的病人就诊，医务人员假日不休息，随到随诊，并且常常把自己的鲜血输给病人。
    今年，生产建设兵团继续开展为各族人民办好事运动。目前各农场一面加紧备耕和进行大规模的农田水利建设；一面抽出力量帮助附近人民公社检修拖拉机和各种农具，培训各种技术人员。乌鲁木齐垦区的十个农场正在为昌吉回族自治州的奇台、木垒哈萨克族自治县、阜康、呼图壁等县人民公社，培训五百名拖拉机手。在水利建设方面，驻在伊犁地区的生产部队，正修建新疆目前最大的伊犁河南岸大渠引水工程，这项工程完工后，不仅将使部队扩大耕地面积二百九十万亩，而且使这一带的巩留县和察布查尔锡伯族自治县，增加灌溉面积一百四十多万亩，改善灌溉面积四十多万亩。　（李东炎）
