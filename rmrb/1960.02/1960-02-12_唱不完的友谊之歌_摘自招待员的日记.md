An Endless Song of Friendship
    —Excerpts from a Receptionist’s Diary
    Xiao Lin

    I
    The rain had been falling incessantly for two days and two nights. It was only 3:00 PM, but the room was already quite dark. I pushed open the door to Kliukov’s office and switched on the light.
    No one was disturbing Expert Kliukov; he was sitting alone on a sofa near the window, reading a book. I was secretly pleased, because it was my suggestion, or rather, something I had deliberately arranged.
    Kliukov is a highly respected telecommunications technology expert. During the Soviet Patriotic War, Kliukov and his comrades, in order to protect telephone lines, lay motionless in an icy river for two days and two nights. After the battle, Kliukov was carried into the hospital. Since then, he had suffered from rheumatoid arthritis.
    After arriving in China, our leaders had repeatedly advised him to take a vacation at a hot spring resort, but he politely declined each time. These past two days, because of the rain, the weather had been bad, and I knew that his arthritis had flared up again. After all, how could he hide anything from the receptionist who had been dealing with him for three or four years? What to do? If I told him to go back and rest, he definitely wouldn't. I had no choice but to report to the leaders and offer my suggestion. After the leaders agreed, I began to implement it – temporarily preventing Chinese comrades from consulting Expert Kliukov on any issues. This was "forced rest."
    I was secretly smug; a receptionist, after all, must do everything possible to fulfill his duties. But where could I find him a hot water bottle...? I was trying to think of a solution when suddenly his translator came to find me.
    "Do you need me for something?" I asked Expert Kliukov.
    "Yes, I do!" He paused and then said, "I'm looking for you to negotiate!"
    He limped over to me, sat on the sofa, and said with a very serious expression: "Thank you for your concern for me. However, concern should be expressed through work, through dedication to our common cause. Not allowing me to work, letting me sit idle, I do not acknowledge that as concern. On the contrary, hindering work should be punished...."
    "Let's talk about this issue," he said, his tone suddenly becoming gentler, almost pleading, as if he felt his attitude had been too serious. "I appreciate your kindness in letting me rest, but whether I'm reading books and newspapers in the room or not, would it be possible for the comrades to bring me the engineering drawings to look at?"
    I didn't know how to respond to the expert's request. In the end, the expert said, "This is the core of the negotiation. How about it, are the conditions not too harsh?" After saying that, he burst into laughter.
    Under the extremely gentle yet compelling gaze of Expert Kliukov, I nodded involuntarily.
    A few minutes later, I found a hot water bottle. When I gave it to Expert Kliukov, three engineering drawings were already spread out on his desk.
    Expert Kliukov took the hot water bottle, looking at it over and over; then he looked at the Chinese comrade who was discussing engineering problems with him. Finally, he warmly shook my hand and said with a meaningful "Spasiba" (thank you)!

    All morning, Expert Domoratsky's computer hadn't stopped; it was constantly whirring and shaking. A stack of paper on the small table flipped over page by page along with the sound of the expert's computer. The teacup on the small table remained untouched, but the ashtray was about to overflow.
    Soviet refractory material expert Comrade Domoratsky had been comparing and calculating for the past few days the renovation plan for the refractory material workshop. This calculation was made after the expert reviewed our proposed plan and conducted an on-site inspection.
    The plan proposed by our designers was to simply choose a new site and build a new type of refractory material workshop to meet the factory's urgent need for refractory materials. Because this refractory material workshop, left over from the Japanese puppet regime, had been completely destroyed, with only rubble remaining under the frame of the building. You could only tell from the master plan that this was originally a refractory material workshop. Therefore, the designers proposed a plan to select another factory site.
    The expert was calculating all morning, and he didn't leave until long after we got off work. However, he came again half an hour before the afternoon shift started. This time his computer wasn't running. That stack of paper with a lot of writing on it from the morning was neatly placed on his desk. The expert lit a cigarette as soon as he entered the office, but he threw it into the ashtray after only a couple of puffs, and then picked up that stack of paper and started reading. I quietly opened a crack in one of the windows of the expert's office.
    The work bell rang, and our designers came to the expert's office to ask for advice. After inviting them to sit down, Expert Domoratsky seriously raised several questions in succession: "Regarding that refractory material workshop, why did you propose a plan to select another factory site? How many plans did you make before reaching this conclusion? How many times did you go to the site to look? Why not utilize the existing foundation? Why...."
    The expert lit a cigarette, stood up, and slowly said, "More plans should be compared, and less money should be spent to accomplish more." The expert paused, stood next to the table, picked up his calculations, and said: "Utilizing the original factory site for reconstruction can make use of the broken factory buildings and the rotary kiln foundation, saving both labor and materials, and it will be faster to put it into production than building a new factory. At the same time, it can save millions of yuan in national investment...."
    Our comrades listened intently, as if they were in a classroom.

    Our leader, representing the Chinese government, pinned a golden "Sino-Soviet Friendship Medal" on Expert Nikolasov's neat lapel. Then, two large hands were held tightly and for a long time. Amidst applause, Expert Nikolasov and our leader warmly embraced, and people applauded even more enthusiastically....
    "Dear Comrades," Expert Nikolasov said happily, "This is not a farewell. It's like giving me an opportunity to go on a business trip, to return to my country to learn newer technologies. After a period of time, I will reapply to come to China and overcome the difficulties facing us side by side with you—my dear comrades...."
    At the time of parting, no matter how warm the atmosphere, our feelings of reluctance to part could not be suppressed. After the dance began, I sat in a corner, thinking about my own affairs. At one moment I thought about the enthusiastic embrace when the expert first arrived in China and the first sentence he said—"I've been on the train for seven or eight days. Finally, I'm home!" At another moment I thought about the expert's meticulous work ethic; and most of all, I thought about the expert's help and education to me—an ordinary receptionist. It was as if a movie was playing before my eyes, scene after scene: ...
    One winter afternoon last year, snowflakes were falling outside, and the house seemed unusually dark. You couldn't see anything at 5:00 PM.
    After turning on the lights in the expert's room, I also turned on the lights in the corridor and the bathroom. Then, I returned to the office.
    A slight sound of leather shoes, and the expert came to my office. After looking at the tea set displayed in the cabinet with great interest, Expert Nikolasov said to me very directly: "I would like to make a suggestion to you—this is the third one; the first two were about saving paper and saving pencils—the content is very simple and very easy to implement, that is, under normal circumstances, the lights in the corridors and bathrooms should all be turned off, and whoever needs to use them should turn them on themselves. Comrade, electricity is the power of industry. Without electricity, our work will encounter unimaginable difficulties...."
    Looking out from the door, the lights in the corridor and the bathroom were all turned off. I knew that it must have been Nikolasov who turned them off. ...
    Don't people often say that the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is a song of praise that can never be finished? This is the truth. I, an ordinary receptionist, have already found it impossible to finish singing, based only on my own work contact and feelings!

    唱不完的友谊之歌
    ——摘自招待员的日记

    一
    ?雨不住地下了两天两夜。才下午三点钟，房间里就很暗了。我推开克留柯夫专家的办公室，顺手把电灯给打开了。
    没人来打扰克留柯夫专家，他独自坐在靠近窗子的一个单人沙发上看书。我暗暗高兴，因为这是我的建议，也可以说是我有意安排的。
    克留柯夫是一位很有名望的电讯技术专家。在苏联卫国战争时期，克留柯夫专家和他的同志们，为了保卫电话线路，在一条冰冻的小河中，一动不动地伏击了两昼夜。战斗结束以后，克留柯夫被抬进了医院。从那时起，他就得下了风湿性关节炎病。
    到中国后，我们领导上曾几次劝他到温泉去休养一个时期，但都被他婉言谢绝。这两天因为下雨，气候不好，我就知道，他的关节炎又发作了。本来嘛，他的一切哪能瞒得住跟他处了三、四年的招待员的眼睛呢。怎么办？让他回去休息吧，他一定不干。我只好向领导反映，提出我的建议。领导同意后，我就开始实行——暂时不要中国同志去请教克留柯夫专家任何问题。这叫“强迫休息”。
    我暗暗得意，招待员嘛，就得千方百计地来履行自己的职责；但是，到哪儿给他找个热水袋才好呢……。我正在想办法，忽然他的翻译员来找我。
    “您找我有事情吗？”我问克留柯夫专家。
    “对，有事！”他停了停又说：“找您来谈判！”
    他一跛一跛地走近我，坐到沙发上，脸色很严肃地说：“谢谢您对我的关心。不过，关心应该表现在工作上，表现在对我们的共同事业上。不让我工作，让我闲坐着，我不承认这就是关心，相反，影响了工作倒应该受到处分……。”
    “我们谈这么一个问题，”他大约感觉态度太严肃了，所以口气突然变得和缓起来，倒有点请求的口吻。“让我休息，这种盛情我领了，但是，在房间里看书看报也是看，能否请同志们把工程图纸拿来给我看。”
    我不知道该怎样来回答专家的要求。最后还是专家说：“这就是谈判的中心。怎么样，条件不苛刻吧？”说完，他就哈哈大笑起来。
    我在克留柯夫专家那极温和但又逼人的眼光的注视下，不自主地点了点头。
    几分钟后，我找到了热水袋，当我送给克留柯夫专家的时候，他桌子上已铺好三张工程图纸。
    克留柯夫专家接过热水袋，翻来复去地看着；然后又看着和他谈工程问题的中国同志。最后热烈地握住我的手，意味深长的说了一声“斯巴西巴”（谢谢）！

    整整一上午，多莫拉茨基专家的计算机都没停过，哗哗哗哗地一直摇。小桌上的一叠纸，随着专家计算机的响声，一页一页地翻过去了。小桌上的茶杯还原封没动地放在那里，但烟灰缸却要满了。
    苏联耐火材料专家多莫拉茨基同志，这几天正为耐火材料车间的改建方案，进行比较、计算。这次计算是专家看过我们提的方案又到现场实地勘察了以后才进行的。
    我们的设计人员提出的方案，是干脆重新选择厂址建一个新型的耐火材料车间，以满足工厂对耐火材料非常急迫的需要。因为，原来日伪时期残留下来的这个耐火材料车间，已经被彻底破坏，房架子下边一片瓦砾，只能在总图上才能知道这里原来是个耐火材料车间了。所以，设计人员提出了另行选厂的方案。
    上午专家因为作计算，我们下班很久了他还没走，但是，离下午上班还有半个多钟头，他就又来了。这次他的计算机没响。上午那一叠写了很多字的纸，整整齐齐地放在他的办公桌上。专家一进办公室就燃着一支烟，但，没吸两口就扔到烟灰缸里，随后就拿起那一叠纸，看了起来。我到专家的办公室里，轻轻把一扇窗户推开了个缝隙。
    上班铃响了，我们的设计人员到专家的办公室来请教问题，多莫拉茨基专家请他们坐下后，就很严肃地连续提出几个问题：“关于那个耐火材料车间，你们为什么提出另选厂址的方案？共作了几个方案得出这么一个结论？去现场看了几次？为什么不利用原有基础？为什么……”。
    专家燃着一支烟站了起来，慢慢地说：“要多做方案比较，少花钱，多办事。”专家停了一停，站在桌子旁边拿起他做的计算书说：“利用原有厂址进行改建，可以利用破厂房和回转窑基础，既省工又省料，比建新厂投入生产还快，同时可以节约数以百万计的国家投资……”
    我们的同志出神地听着，好像在课堂上一样。
    三
    我们的首长代表我国政府在尼可拉索夫专家整洁的衣襟上，别上了一枚金色的“中苏友谊纪念章”，然后，两只大手紧紧地、长久地握在一起，一片掌声中，尼可拉索夫专家和我们的首长热烈地拥抱，人们更热烈地鼓掌……。
    “亲爱的同志们：”尼可拉索夫专家愉快地说：“我们不是分别，这好像是给我一个出差的机会，回国学习更新的技术。过一个时间后，我还要重新申请到中国来，和你们——亲爱的同志们，并肩克服摆在我们面前的困难……。”
    分别的时候，气氛再热烈，也抑制不住我们的惜别心情。舞会开始后，我一直坐在一个角落，想我自己的心事：一会儿想到专家刚到中国时我们见面时的热烈的拥抱和他说的第一句话——“坐了七八天火车，这回总算到家了！”一会儿又想到专家那种一丝不苟的工作精神；而想的最多的是专家对我——一个普通招待员的帮助和教育。我眼前像演电影似的，一幕一幕地在进行着：……
    去年冬天的一个下午，外边飘着雪花，房子里显得异常阴暗，才五点钟就什么也看不到了。
    我把专家房间的电灯打开以后，顺便把走廊、厕所的灯也都打开了。然后，我回到办公室。
    一阵轻微的皮鞋声，专家到我的办公室来。尼可拉索夫专家满有兴趣地看了看摆在柜子里的茶具以后，很干脆地对我说：“我想给你提个建议——这是第三个，前两个一个是节约用纸，一个是节约铅笔——内容很简单，也很容易实现，就是在一般时候，走廊和厕所的电灯应该统统关掉，谁用的时候，谁自己去开。同志，电是工业的动力，没有电，我们的工作将会遇到想像不到的困难……。”
    从门里看出去，走廊和厕所的灯都关掉了，我知道，这一定是尼可拉索夫专家关的。……
    人们不是经常说吗？中苏人民的友谊，是一支永远唱不完的赞歌。这是真话。我，一个普通的招待员，仅仅根据我自己工作的接触和感受，就已经唱不完了！
