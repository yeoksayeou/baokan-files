    Barbarity and Shamelessness
    By a commentator of this newspaper
    The barbarity and shamelessness of U.S. imperialism have once again been exposed to the people of the world.
    Since the second half of 1959, the peaceful land of Cuba has been constantly subjected to sneak attacks by foreign aircraft, and Cuba's sugar cane fields and sugar mills have been subjected to dozens of insane bombings. According to incomplete statistics, the amount of sugar cane burned has reached 19.3 million arrobas (one arroba equals 11.338 kilograms). It is not difficult to see that this sinful bombing is a vicious conspiracy to undermine Cuba's national economy. The Cuban government has long revealed that these foreign aircraft came from the United States. However, the U.S. government has repeatedly denied this crime, not only rejecting the Cuban government's strong protests, but also attempting to bite back. Not long ago, Eisenhower himself came forward to accuse Cuba's protests against the United States as "groundless attacks!" However, as the Chinese saying goes, if you don't want people to know, don't do it. The black hand of U.S. imperialism extending into Cuba has finally been caught.
    On the morning of February 18, an aircraft that had attacked Cuba crashed. The pilot was a member of the U.S. Federal Civil Defense Administration, carrying maps showing planned bombings of Cuban sugar mills and sugar cane fields, on which the two bases of these aerial bandits in the United States were marked. The pilot's diary clearly recorded the crimes of this aircraft in bombing Cuba on February 3, 15, and 17. With irrefutable evidence, the U.S. State Department had to come out and "apologize" to Cuba! The Associated Press helplessly reported that "the official admission of the accusation of air raids is very embarrassing to the U.S. authorities because it previously strongly denied and dismissed similar Cuban claims." In this very awkward situation, the U.S. State Department even attempted to whitewash its own crimes, describing this aircraft as a "private aircraft" that "managed to escape the vigilance of our (referring to the United States) strengthened airport patrols." In this way, the U.S. government seems not only not to be the culprit of the bombing of Cuba, but also seems to have strengthened "patrols" and "vigilance" to prevent such incidents from happening! However, using this kind of excuse will only make matters worse. Doesn't the United States often proclaim that it has a very complete air defense warning system and a dense radar network? So, how could an aircraft take off from the United States, not just once, but dozens of times, and be able to "escape" U.S. vigilance! This clumsy deceptive tactic of the U.S. State Department can only further expose its shamelessness!
    The U.S. imperialist crime of armed intervention in Cuba has already set off a new wave of anger in Cuba. The Cuban people are determined to defend the sugar mills and the sugar cane fields. They are all armed and determined to punish the invaders. To deal with ferocious imperialism, only by organizing forces and carrying out resolute struggle against them can their aggressive crimes be stopped. The Chinese people, like all peace-loving people in the world, strongly condemn this aggressive crime of U.S. imperialism in undermining the peaceful construction of the Cuban people, and firmly support the heroic struggle of the Cuban people to defend the fruits of the revolution and oppose U.S. intervention.

    野蛮和无耻
    本报评论员
    美帝国主义的野蛮和无耻，又一次暴露在全世界人民眼前。
    自从1959年下半年以来，和平的古巴土地，不断遭到外国飞机的偷袭，古巴的蔗田和糖厂遭到几十次的疯狂轰炸。据不完全统计，仅仅被烧毁的甘蔗已达一千九百三十万阿罗瓦（一阿罗瓦等于十一点三三八公斤）。不难看出，这种罪恶的轰炸，是破坏古巴国民经济的恶毒阴谋。关于这些外国飞机，古巴政府早就揭露是来自美国的。但是，美国政府对于这一罪行却百般狡赖，不仅拒绝古巴政府的强硬抗议，并且还想反咬一口。就在不久以前，艾森豪威尔曾亲自出马，指责古巴对美国的抗议是“毫无理由的攻击！”可是，正像中国俗话所说的，若要人不知，除非己莫为。美帝国主义这只伸入古巴的黑手，终于被捉住了。
    2月18日早晨，一架偷袭古巴的飞机，坠毁了。飞行员是美国联邦民防署的成员，携带着有计划轰炸古巴糖厂和蔗田的地图，在这个地图上，标出了这些飞贼在美国的两个基地。飞行员的日记，明白地记载着这架飞机在2月3日、15日和17日轰炸古巴的罪行。铁证如山，美国国务院不得不出来向古巴“道歉”了！美联社无可奈何地报道说：“官方对空袭的指责的承认是使美国当局十分难堪的事，因为它先前极力否认并且斥责了类似的古巴的说法”。在这种十分尴尬的局面下，美国国务院竟企图洗脱自己的罪恶，把这架飞机说成是“私人的飞机”，而又是“设法逃过了我们（指美国）加强了的机场巡逻的警戒”。如此说来，美国政府似乎不仅不是轰炸古巴的罪魁，并且还似乎曾经加强了“巡逻”和“警戒”，来防止这类事件的发生哩！可是，使用这种遁词，只会欲盖弥彰。美国不是经常宣扬它拥有十分完备的防空警戒系统，拥有密布的雷达网吗？那么，怎么会有飞机从美国起飞，又不只一次，而是几十次，竟能够“逃过”美国的警戒！美国国务院这种拙劣的欺骗手法，只能是进一步暴露了它的无耻！
    美帝国主义武装干涉古巴的罪行，已经在古巴掀起了新的愤怒的浪潮，古巴人民决心保卫糖厂，保卫甘蔗田，他们都武装起来了，决心惩罚入侵者。对待凶恶的帝国主义，只有组织力量，同它们进行坚决的斗争，才能制止它们的侵略罪行。中国人民同全世界一切爱好和平的人民一样，严厉谴责美帝国主义这种破坏古巴人民和平建设的侵略罪行，坚决支持古巴人民保卫革命胜利果实，反对美国干涉的英勇斗争。
