One Cut Makes a Hundred Garments

    Entering the cutting workshop of the Beijing Garment Factory, one sees six or seventy-meter-long wooden tables where double-wheeled cloth-pulling machines shuttle back and forth with whole bolts of blue cloth, neatly stacking one hundred and twenty layers in a short time. A worker places a pattern made of cowhide paper with many small holes on the cloth layers and brushes white powder over it, clearly marking the dotted lines for cutting the garment material. Immediately afterward, the worker swiftly moves the electric cutting machine, and within thirty-five minutes, the material for one hundred and twenty tops is cut perfectly. This electric cutting machine was made by the factory's own workers; it is twenty-eight times more efficient than manual cutting, and the cut pieces are neater.

    The cut material is sent to the sewing workshop. Here, the workers do not need to step on pedals; they simply turn on the power, place two sleeve pieces under the needle of a semi-automatic sleeve attaching machine, and the machine automatically sews them together. If the needle skips or the thread breaks, it automatically stops. It takes only twenty seconds to sew one sleeve. While sewing sleeves, different straight-line and curved-line tasks such as trouser crotches, waistband bands, and garment pockets are also sewn with semi-automatic machines and double-needle machines. Even the ironing and attaching of collar stands and pocket flaps are done with semi-automatic machines instead of manual operation.

    In the technical innovation movement, the staff and workers of the state-owned Beijing Garment Factory have improved and successfully trial-produced many kinds of large and small sewing machines and tools. Most of the factory's processes have achieved semi-mechanization, mechanization, or semi-automation, increasing labor efficiency by more than five times. In the past, each person could only sew an average of 1.073 sets of padded clothing per day. After the innovation, each person can sew an average of 6.857 sets per day.

    一剪裁成百件衣
    走进北京被服厂的剪裁车间，只见六、七十米长的木案上，双轮拉布车带着整匹蓝布来回飞跑，一会儿就整齐地叠好一百二十层。一个工人把打着许多小孔的牛皮纸的样板，铺在布层上，用白粉往上一刷，剪裁衣料的虚线条就清清楚楚地印上了。紧接着，工人轻快地移动电力剪裁机，三十五分钟内，一百二十件上衣布料都被合格地剪好了。这种电力剪裁机是职工自己制造的，它比手工剪裁提高效率二十八倍，裁下的衣片也比手工剪的整齐。
    剪裁好的衣料送到缝纫车间。这里的工人也不用脚蹬踏板，只要打开电门，拿两个袖片往半自动包大袖机的针下放好，机器就哒哒地自动缝制起来。遇到空针、断线立即自动停止，二十秒钟就把一个衣袖缝好了。在缝衣袖的同时，裤裆、裤腰拌带和衣袋等不同的直线活、曲线活，也有半自动机、双针机缝制。就是烫贴领座、袋盖也都用半自动机代替了手工操作。
    国营北京被服厂职工在技术革新运动中，改进和试制成功了许多种大小缝纫机械和工具，厂里绝大部分工序都实现了半机械化、机械化或半自动化，劳动效率提高了五倍多。过去每人每天平均只能缝一点零七三套棉服，经过革新每人每天平均可以缝制六点八五七套。
