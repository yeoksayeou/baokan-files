Let's Calculate the "Water Bill"
　　Chuan Liu

    To ensure our bumper summer harvest, some areas showing signs of spring drought are actively taking measures to prevent and combat drought.

    To prevent drought, we must have water. Do we have enough water on hand? Some say that since there is a drought, of course there is a water shortage. No, that is not a scientific way of speaking. If we calculate a "water bill," we will find that water is not lacking.

    On our country's land, an average of more than 6.2 trillion cubic meters of water is "received" (falling down) from the sky each year. The water needed for the country's farmland is at most about one-tenth of this number. Even in years with less rain, it should be enough.

  The problem is that water has many other "expenditures" besides irrigating farmland, and it is spent as soon as it is received, which is a so-called "running account." A large "expenditure" is loss, and another is evaporation.

    To prevent drought, we must reduce these "expenditures" and turn them into "savings" for application.

    Reservoirs and ponds are familiar "banks" of water, but water also has a very important "bank" underground.

    There is a lot of water in the soil. If deep plowing is carried out to form many small aggregates in the soil, increasing the pores in the soil, then it is easy for water to seep in and store more water; at the same time, it can also prevent a large amount of water from evaporating, keeping the soil at a considerable humidity. Because when the soil is very dense and the internal pores are very small, water easily rises to the ground along it, just like oil is absorbed by a lamp wick.

    Water is not only stored in the soil, but can also be stored in rocks through the soil, which is a larger reservoir. Although the amount of underground water in our country has not been fully ascertained, judging from the fact that the underground water in the entire earth's crust is estimated to reach 4 billion cubic meters, which is hundreds of times more than the water in rivers and lakes, the underground water in our country should also be very abundant. In 1958, the underground sea discovered in Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan stored more water than all the rivers in the country. Underground water is also widely distributed in high mountains and desert areas, so there is no need to worry about finding water sources.

    Water also has a "bank" on the ground, which is the glacier zone. The northwestern region of our country is relatively dry, and the melted alpine snow and ice have become an important source of water there. The storage capacity of only a part of the glaciers in the Tianshan Mountains is more than 80 billion cubic meters.

    Calculated, the water we receive is indeed a lot, but the important thing is to "reduce expenditure" and reduce many "expenditures" that are lost in vain.

    Even in the necessary "expenditure" – irrigating farmland – it is still possible to save a lot. For example, using water rationally to maximize its effectiveness, and irrigating appropriately according to the water demand of crops in different stages of growth, etc.

    The People's Daily editorial on February 10 proposed that we should calculate the "water bill" and formulate water use plans, which is very important. Whether water is used rationally or not, the effectiveness of the same amount of water can vary greatly. A few years ago, Pangmen Village in Biyang County, Henan Province, was able to organize rational water use after mutual assistance and cooperation, so that the same amount of water increased from irrigating 540 mu of land when working individually to irrigating more than 4,500 mu. Now that we have formed a powerful people's commune, under the unified planning of the commune, water will be used more sparingly, and more water sources will be developed. As long as we exert sufficient effort, any drought can be eliminated.

    算一算“水账”
    川流
    为了保证我们的夏季大丰收，一些有了春旱迹象的地区，正在积极采取措施来防旱抗旱。
    要防旱就得有水，那么我们手头有没有足够的水呢？有人说，既然出现旱象，当然是缺水了。不，这样说很不科学，如果我们给水算一算“账”，便会发现水并不缺。
    在我国的土地上，平均每年要从天空“收入”（降下来的）水六万二千多亿公方，全国农田所需的水顶多不过占这个数字的十分之一左右，即使有的年份雨少一点，也应该是够用的。
  问题在于水除了灌溉农田外还有其他许多“支出”，而且随收随支，是所谓“流水账”；一笔大的“支出”是流失，另一笔是蒸发。
    要防旱，就得减少这方面的“支出”，使它们转为“存款”以备应用。
    水库、塘堰是我们熟知的水的“银行”，其实水还有个很重要的“银行”在地下。
    在土壤中含有很多水，如果进行深耕，使土壤形成许多小的粒团，加大了土壤中的孔隙，这时就便于水的渗入，储蓄更多的水；同时还能防止水的大量蒸发，使土壤保持相当的湿度。因为在土壤很紧密、内部孔隙很小的时候，水容易沿着它升到地面，就像油被灯草吸起来一样。
    水不仅储存在土壤里，还可以透过土壤藏在岩石中，这是个更大的水库。我国的地下究竟有多少水，虽然还没有全部查清，但从整个地壳中的地下水估计达到四十亿亿公方，比河湖中的水多几百倍的情况来看，我国的地下水也应该是很丰富的。1958年在江苏、安徽、河南一带发现的地下海的储水就比全国所有河流的水量还多。在高山、沙漠地区也有地下水广泛分布，不愁找不到水源。
    水在地面上还有一个“银行”就是冰川地带。我国西北地区较干旱，融化后的高山冰雪成了那里重要的水源。仅天山上一部分冰川的储水量便有八百多亿公方。
    算起来，我们收入的水确是不少，但重要的是要“节流”，减少许多白白损失的“支出”。
    就是在必要的“支出”——灌溉农田方面，也还是可以大大节约的。例如合理用水，使水发挥最大的效用，以及根据农作物生长过程，在各个不同阶段中的需水情况适当灌溉等。
    2月10日人民日报社论中提出应当算清“水账”，制订用水计划，是非常重要的。能不能合理用水，同样多的水所起的效用可以相差很大。几年前，河南泌阳县庞门村由于互助合作后有可能组织起来合理用水，使同样多的水量从单干时浇地五百四十亩提高到能浇四千五百多亩。现在我们已组成了威力巨大的人民公社，在公社的统一规划下，用水将更为节省，水源也将开辟得更多，只要我们鼓足干劲，任何旱象都是可以消灭的。
