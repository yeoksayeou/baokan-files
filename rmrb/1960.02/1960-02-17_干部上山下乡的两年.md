    Cadres Go Up to the Mountains and Down to the Countryside for Two Years
    Shao Shiping, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee, Governor of Jiangxi Province
    It has been two years since the cadres of Jiangxi Province went up to the mountains and down to the countryside to develop and build mountainous areas. After the decisive victory of the nationwide rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle in 1957, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, in order to implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council on training cadres and transferring cadres to strengthen the labor front, and in light of the province's situation, put forward the call for cadres to go up to the mountains and down to the countryside to develop and build mountainous areas. Cadres throughout the province warmly responded to this call. Within days, hundreds of thousands of big-character posters were put up, expressing their determination and submitting applications, setting off a vigorous and unprecedented upsurge of cadres going up to the mountains and down to the countryside to participate in labor production. Amidst the clamor of gongs and drums and the waving of red flags, tens of thousands of cadres from across the province formed a large labor force, marched mightily to various mountainous areas, and, together with the broad masses of people in the mountainous areas, began the great battle of building new socialist mountainous areas.
    After the cadres went up to the mountains and down to the countryside, a new situation emerged in the socialist construction of the mountainous areas throughout the province. The economy and culture of the mountainous areas have seen an all-round upsurge, and the face of the mountainous areas has undergone tremendous changes. Two hundred and nine state-owned comprehensive reclamation farms and agricultural (pastoral) farms have been established in the deserted deep mountains and dense forests and on long-unused land. Each reclamation farm generally has more than ten thousand mu or even tens of thousands of mu of cultivated land, and hundreds of thousands of mu of mountain forests. Each reclamation farm has absorbed a large number of workers to participate in the construction of mountainous areas, with the transferred cadres as the core. Furthermore, during the people's commune movement, based on the needs of production and the demands of the masses, more than 1,800 advanced agricultural cooperatives with 930,000 farmers voluntarily applied to join the state-owned comprehensive reclamation farms, thereby enabling the reclamation farms to develop even further. Due to the implementation of the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture and comprehensively managing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, all production undertakings in the state-owned comprehensive reclamation farms throughout the province have achieved tremendous leaps forward. In 1959, the total industrial and agricultural output value totaled 520 million yuan, an increase of more than 69% compared with 1958. There has been great development in the grain, cotton, oil crops, fruit trees, silkworms, and other economic crops of the reclamation farms. The area of forest cultivation and afforestation and the amount of timber felled have all increased by one or several times. Livestock, poultry, and fishery production have also increased several times. Mountainous industry was established on a blank sheet of paper and has developed particularly rapidly. According to the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods and progressing from indigenous to foreign, the state-owned comprehensive reclamation farms throughout the province have given full play to the spirit of communist creation and have established more than 2,200 various factories and dozens of small power stations. The vast mountainous areas have begun to be built into important bases for socialist commodity production. Transportation in the mountainous areas has also greatly developed, and most mountainous areas and reclamation farm locations are now accessible by automobile. The mountainous areas have also established communist labor universities that combine part-time work and part-time study, and combine mental and physical labor. The main campus and various branch campuses have more than 55,000 students, greatly developing higher education in the mountainous areas. Each comprehensive reclamation farm has also established more than 200 scientific research institutes and botanical and zoological research gardens, laying a preliminary foundation for carrying out scientific research work in the mountainous areas. The cultural and health undertakings in the mountainous areas have also experienced vigorous development. The vast number of cadres who went up to the mountains and down to the countryside have not only created tremendous achievements in labor production, but have also greatly improved politically and ideologically. They have closely linked themselves with the masses, worked hard, and conscientiously done much work for the Party and the people. The brilliant achievements made in developing and building mountainous areas in Jiangxi Province have a significant impact and role in the continued leap forward of socialist construction.
    The planned development and construction of mountainous areas is a problem that must be solved in our entire socialist construction undertaking. Socialist construction is comprehensive. We must not only carry out socialist construction in cities, but also in rural areas and vast mountainous areas. We must gradually eliminate the differences between urban and rural areas, which also includes gradually eliminating the differences between cities and mountainous areas. Of course, there are certain characteristics in carrying out socialist construction in mountainous areas. Due to different specific conditions in various places, the methods of carrying out socialist construction in mountainous areas are not necessarily the same, and the time and speed can also vary. However, it is certain that we must carry out socialist construction in mountainous areas to meet the needs of the entire socialist construction. One of the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism is to recognize the universal laws of the development of objective things and to conduct specific analysis based on specific circumstances. Correctly understanding the issue of carrying out socialist construction in mountainous areas is necessary for our current entire socialist construction, and it is also necessary for future communist construction.
    From the perspective of the specific situation in Jiangxi Province, the construction of mountainous areas is even more important. This is because the mountainous area of Jiangxi is extremely vast, the vast mountainous area has a large amount of forest resources, forest by-products, and inexhaustible and inexhaustible various wild plants, and has iron, coal, various non-ferrous metals and rare metal mineral deposits, and has a large amount of land that can be reclaimed. At the same time, the vast majority of mountainous areas in the province are old revolutionary base areas, and the people in the mountainous areas have a glorious revolutionary tradition. Due to the long-term arduous struggle of the revolution, the vast mountainous areas have suffered severe devastation from the Kuomintang reactionaries, resulting in a sharp decline in population, barren land, low production, and a hard life. After liberation, we carried out a series of work to restore and develop production in mountainous areas, creating favorable conditions for planned socialist construction in mountainous areas. Therefore, the decision made by the Provincial Party Committee in 1957 to respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and transfer a large number of cadres to the mountains to build mountainous areas was correct and well-founded. Although some individuals at the time had a somewhat vague understanding of this measure, and even doubted whether cadres going up to the mountains and down to the countryside could gain a foothold, the great achievements and vivid facts of cadres going up to the mountains and down to the countryside to develop and build mountainous areas over the past two years have eliminated the various doubts of a few people. Cadres who went up to the mountains and down to the countryside have not only firmly established themselves in the mountainous areas, but have also brought about tremendous changes in the poor and backward face of the mountainous areas, which are rapidly prospering. Practice has proven that as long as the leadership is determined to develop and build mountainous areas, and resolutely implements the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, and breaks with right-leaning conservative thinking, the socialist construction undertaking in mountainous areas, like other places, can achieve a great leap forward.
    Based on our experience over the past two years, transferring cadres to the mountains and down to the countryside to establish comprehensive reclamation farms has many benefits for developing and building mountainous areas. First, it is composed of cadres as the backbone, so it is politically and organizationally stronger and more consolidated; second, it is a socialist public ownership, so it is easy to implement the Party's various policies on developing and building mountainous areas, implement the national unified plan, and support national construction; third, it can drive the development of socialist collective ownership economy in the vast mountainous and rural areas, and help the gradual transition from collective ownership to public ownership, and from socialism to communism in the future; fourth, since cadres directly participate in labor production and specifically lead and organize production in mountainous areas, it is easier to cultivate a team of proletarian revolutionary cadres who are both red and expert for our Party; fifth, it can educate the masses, play a great role in changing customs and habits, and further strengthen the ties between the Party and the government and the broad masses of people. In summary: taking the publicly owned comprehensive reclamation farm as the core, and the close combination of the reclamation farm and the people's commune as the foundation, can enable the socialist construction of mountainous areas in Jiangxi Province to develop faster. Of course, our construction work in mountainous areas is just beginning. Compared with the needs of national and people's construction, our work experience is still very insufficient. We must continue to work hard and study hard, continue to earnestly sum up experience in the work of developing and building mountainous areas, and redouble our efforts to do a better job in the socialist construction of mountainous areas.
    Our motherland is in a great era of leaping development, and our cause is surging forward. Last year, we achieved another great leap forward in all aspects of the national economy. 1960 will continue to achieve a leap forward. In order to accelerate socialist construction, we must further strengthen the leadership of agricultural production while accelerating socialist industrialization, and further accelerate the speed of agricultural development. Because the issue of developing agricultural production is not only a major issue related to the needs of people's lives, but in essence, it is a major issue related to the realization of socialist industrialization in our country. Chairman Mao has elaborated on this in detail in his reports on "The Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." To further accelerate the speed of agricultural development, we must actively and as soon as possible realize agricultural modernization. This is the urgent demand of the people of the whole country, and it is also the urgent demand for the continued leap forward of the entire national economy. According to the national plan, Jiangxi will be one of the key provinces for promoting agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification this year, which is an honor for the people of the whole province. All localities and departments in the province should continue to deeply encourage enthusiasm, deploy the work of the 1960 great leap forward with the focus on realizing agricultural modernization and supporting agricultural modernization, welcome the advent of the high tide of agricultural technological transformation, and serve to promote the continuous leap forward of agricultural production and the entire national economy. Realizing agricultural modernization in accordance with local conditions and based on the characteristics of mountainous areas is an important condition for further accelerating the socialist construction of mountainous areas. Under the leadership of the Party, all state-owned comprehensive reclamation farms in the province should further closely integrate with the broad masses of people in the mountainous areas, actively strive hard, and, under the principle of national support and self-reliance, combine with the specific conditions of the locality to accelerate the realization of agricultural modernization in mountainous areas, strive to be at the forefront of the movement, and give full play to the superiority of public ownership. Communist labor universities in various places should be run even more actively, and roads should be opened up so that everyone can enter university. All cadres who have gone up to the mountains and down to the countryside and all teachers and students of communist labor universities must consolidate the achievements already made, make persistent efforts, advance victoriously, hold the red flag of the general line even higher, and march towards building prosperous and happy new socialist mountainous areas, and strive to build our motherland into great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture as soon as possible.

    干部上山下乡的两年
    中共江西省委书记　江西省省长　邵式平
    江西省干部上山下乡开发和建设山区已经两年了。从1957年全民整风运动和反右派斗争取得决定性胜利以后，省委、省人民委员会为了贯彻执行党中央和国务院关于锻炼干部，抽调干部加强劳动战线的指示，结合我省情况，提出了干部上山下乡开发和建设山区的号召。全省干部热烈响应了这个号召。几天之间，贴出了几十万张大字报，纷纷表决心，送申请书，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的、史无前例的干部上山下乡参加劳动生产的热潮。在锣鼓爆竹喧天、红旗招展的欢送声中，全省几万名干部组成了一支劳动大军，浩浩荡荡开赴各个山区，并和广大山区群众结合在一起，开始了建设社会主义新山区的伟大战斗。
    干部上山下乡之后，全省山区的社会主义建设，出现了一个崭新的局面，山区的经济、文化有了全面的高涨，山区的面貌发生了巨大的变化。在荒无人烟的深山密林中和长期未被利用的土地上，已经建立起二百零九个国营综合垦殖场和农（牧）场。每个垦殖场一般都有万亩以上以至数万亩的耕地，几十万亩的山林。每个垦殖场都以下放干部为核心吸收了大批职工参加山区建设，并且在人民公社化运动中，根据生产需要和群众要求，有一千八百多个高级农业社九十三万农民自动申请加入了国营综合垦殖场，从而使各垦殖场有了更大的发展。全省国营综合垦殖场由于贯彻执行了工业和农业同时并举和农、林、牧、副、渔综合经营的方针，各项生产事业都实现了巨大的跃进。1959年工农业总产值共计五亿二千万元，比1958年增加69％多。垦殖场的粮食、棉花、油料、果木、蚕桑以及其他经济作物，都有了很大的发展。育林、造林面积和砍伐木材数量，都增加了一倍或几倍。家畜家禽和渔业生产，也有了成倍的增长。山区工业是在一张白纸上建立起来的，发展得尤其迅速。全省国营综合垦殖场根据土洋结合、由土到洋的原则，发挥了共产主义创造精神，已办起各种工场二千二百多个，建立小型发电站几十座。广大山区已开始建设成为社会主义商品生产的重要基地。山区交通运输也大大发展了，绝大部分山区和垦殖场所在地都通了汽车。山区还创办了半工半读、脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的共产主义劳动大学，总校及各分校共有学生五万五千余名，使高等教育在山区大为发展。各个综合垦殖场还创办了科学研究所和动植物研究园二百多所，为山区开展科学研究工作打下了初步基础。山区的文化、卫生事业也有了蓬勃的发展。广大上山下乡干部不但在劳动生产中创造了巨大的成绩，而且在政治思想上，也有了很大的提高。他们密切联系群众，艰苦奋斗，勤勤恳恳为党为人民做了许多工作。江西省开发和建设山区所获得的光辉成就，对于社会主义建设事业的继续跃进，具有重大影响和作用。
  有计划地开发和建设山区，是我们整个社会主义建设事业中一个必须解决的问题。社会主义建设是全面的，我们不仅要在城市进行社会主义建设，而且也要在农村和广大山区进行社会主义建设。我们要逐步消灭城乡之间的差别，也就包括了逐步消灭城市和山区之间的差别在内。当然，在山区进行社会主义建设有一定的特点，各个地方由于具体条件不同，在山区进行社会主义建设的方法也不一定一样，时间和速度也可以有先有后，有快有慢。但是，要在山区进行社会主义建设，以适应整个社会主义建设的需要，这是肯定的。马克思列宁主义基本原理之一，就是要承认客观事物发展的普遍规律，又要根据具体情况进行具体分析。正确认识在山区进行社会主义建设的问题，对于我们当前整个社会主义建设是有必要的，就是对于将来进行共产主义建设来说，也是必要的。
    从江西省具体情况来看，山区建设更为重要。因为江西山区的面积极为广大，广大山区有着大量的森林资源、林副产品和取之不尽、用之不竭的各种野生植物，有着铁、煤各种有色金属和稀有金属矿藏，有着大量可以开垦的土地。同时，全省绝大多数山区又都是老革命根据地，山区人民有着光荣的革命传统。由于革命的长期艰苦斗争，广大山区都遭受过国民党反动派的严重摧残，以致人口锐减，土地荒芜，生产很低，生活很苦。解放后，我们进行了一系列的恢复和发展山区生产的工作，为有计划地在山区进行社会主义建设创造了有利的条件。因此，1957年省委响应党中央的号召，抽调大批干部上山建设山区的决定，是正确的，也是有根据的。虽然，当时个别人对于这一措施认识有些模糊，甚至怀疑干部上山下乡能否站得住脚，但是，两年来干部上山下乡开发和建设山区的伟大成就和生动事实，已经把少数人的种种怀疑消除了。上山下乡干部不但在山区扎实地站稳了脚跟，而且已经使山区贫穷落后的面貌发生了巨大的变化，正在迅速地繁荣起来。实践证明，只要领导上下决心去开发和建设山区，并且在工作中坚决贯彻执行党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，打破右倾保守思想，山区的社会主义建设事业和其它地方一样，是能够实现大跃进的。
    根据我们两年来的经验，抽调干部上山下乡建立综合垦殖场，对于开发和建设山区有着许多好处。第一、它是由干部为骨干组成的，因而在政治上、组织上是比较坚强的、巩固的；第二、它是社会主义的全民所有制的，因而易于贯彻执行党开发和建设山区的各项方针政策，执行国家统一计划，支援国家建设；第三、它可以带动广大山区和农村社会主义的集体所有制经济的发展，并有助于将来由集体所有制逐步过渡到全民所有制，由社会主义逐步过渡到共产主义；第四、由于干部直接参加劳动生产和具体领导组织山区生产，它更便于为我们党培养出一支又红又专的、无产阶级革命干部队伍；第五、它能教育群众，起到移风易俗的伟大影响作用，并进一步密切党和政府与广大人民群众的联系。概括起来就是：以全民所有制的综合垦殖场为核心，以垦殖场和人民公社的密切结合为基础，就可使江西省山区的社会主义建设得到更快的发展。当然，我们山区的建设工作只是开始。对于国家和人民的建设的需要来说，我们的工作经验还很不够。我们必须继续努力工作和努力学习，继续在开发和建设山区的工作中，认真的总结经验，鼓足更大干劲，把山区社会主义建设工作做得更好。
    我们的祖国正处在飞跃发展的伟大时代，我们的事业正在汹涌澎湃地前进。我们去年在国民经济各个方面又实现了巨大的跃进。1960年将继续实现跃进。为了加快社会主义建设，我们必须在加速社会主义工业化的同时，进一步加强对农业生产的领导，进一步加速农业发展的速度。因为发展农业生产的问题，不仅是关系人民生活需要的重大问题，而实质上是关系我国实现社会主义工业化的一个重大问题。关于这一点，毛主席早在“关于农业合作化问题”和“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”报告中详细阐述过了。要进一步加快农业发展速度，就必须积极地、尽快地实现农业现代化。这是全国人民的迫切要求，也是整个国民经济继续跃进的迫切要求。根据国家计划，江西今年将是推行农业机械化、水利化、电气化的重点省份之一，这是全省人民的光荣。全省各个地方、各个部门，都应该继续深入鼓干劲，以实现农业现代化，支援农业现代化为中心来部署1960年大跃进的工作，来迎接农业技术改造高潮的来到，为促进农业生产和整个国民经济不断跃进服务。根据山区特点，因地制宜地实现农业现代化，乃是进一步加快山区社会主义建设的重要条件。全省各国营综合垦殖场，应当在党的领导下，更进一步密切结合广大山区群众，积极努力，在国家支援和自力更生的原则下，结合当地的具体情况，加速在山区实现农业现代化，力争走在运动的前头，充分发挥全民所有制的优越性。各地共产主义劳动大学更应积极办好，要为人人都能进大学开辟道路。全体上山下乡干部和共产主义劳动大学全体师生，要巩固已经取得的成绩，再接再厉，乘胜前进，更高地举起总路线的红旗，向建设繁荣幸福的社会主义新山区迈进，为尽快地把我们祖国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大社会主义国家而奋斗。
