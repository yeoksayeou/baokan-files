    Record of Attacking the Light
    By our reporter Zhou Yongkang
    China-made hormone drug "Cortisone" has begun to be produced in batches in Shanghai. When the news came from Shanghai General Pharmaceutical Factory before the National Day last year, many people felt both excited and surprised. People are excited that this advanced drug, which has only appeared internationally in recent years, can also be manufactured in our country. The General Pharmaceutical Factory, which manufactures this drug, was originally a "lane factory," and the people who wiped out this "blank spot" in China's pharmaceutical industry were nineteen ordinary workers. It seems like an incredible thing. However, these pioneers, with the ambition to win glory for the country, after more than one hundred and seventy failures, finally captured this cutting-edge technology fortress and created a mythical miracle.
    Among hormone drugs, "Cortisone" is indeed an important drug. It can treat more than twenty kinds of diseases. For example, special toxic pneumonia, bronchial asthma, and post-operative shock that cannot be cured with antibiotics can all achieve significant results with "Cortisone." "Cortisone" is a cutting-edge variety of hormones, and its technical requirements are very complex. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the workers of the General Pharmaceutical Factory made a great ambition to make their factory the vanguard of China's climb to the hormone peak. At the end of 1958, this battle to attack the peak began at the General Pharmaceutical Factory. The workers were very enthusiastic, but what conditions were prepared in the factory for this battle at that time? First, there was no special equipment; second, there was no technical data. Even if there were some reference charts, everyone took a look, and they were densely packed with chemical equations. In the words of the workers, "They recognize us, but we don't recognize them." Everyone shook their heads while looking. The factory's Party General Branch held a special meeting for this purpose, and decided that the General Branch Secretary would personally take charge and first organize several Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and production activists to form a trial production team. As a result, the enthusiasm of the masses rose. Some said: "To climb the peak of world advanced technology is like climbing a high mountain range. There will always be difficulties, otherwise it would not be called climbing high." Several Communist Youth League members were even more energetic, saying: "Which thing in the world was not pioneered by people? If foreigners can do it, why can't we?"
    Everything is difficult at the beginning, which is absolutely true. In the beginning, with the help of the scientific department, the factory made a little bit of "Cortisone" crystals, and had already encountered many difficulties. Later, to expand this little bit into industrial production, the serious difficulties were even greater. To produce "Cortisone" in large quantities, it is first necessary to make an intermediate raw material called diosgenin. According to the general method, it must be extracted using a device called a continuous extractor. However, this extractor consumes a large amount of steel plates, and after it is made, extracting one kilogram of diosgenin requires consuming twenty to thirty kilograms of petroleum ether. Petroleum ether is also a volatile and dangerous raw material. If it is used too much, production is unsafe and it is harmful to the human body. This problem is only the first step in the entire "Cortisone" production process. If this hurdle is not broken, the subsequent synthesis work will inevitably stop completely.
    No one expected that Bao Xudong, a fifty-five-year-old worker in the factory, would become an excellent pioneer at this critical juncture. After seeing the continuous extractor in a research institute, Bao Xudong also felt that it was uneconomical and unsuitable, and wholeheartedly wanted to make one himself. Although he had worked in a pharmaceutical factory for more than thirty years, he usually did some dispensing and mixing work, and later he had not done any design work. This time, this old worker really dared to think and dared to do. Regardless of the fact that he had just removed his illiteracy label, he still picked up a pen and drew every day when he returned home. If the drawing was not good, he would start again. His wife advised him: "Even if you want to design, you don't need to be so anxious, why bother making yourself so nervous." He said, "I am not afraid of being nervous and working hard, I just can't stand being bullied." This nonsensical answer made his wife think he was angry with someone. When asked, he laughed: "It's to not be bullied by imperialism. They insist that we can't produce 'Cortisone' quickly. We must fight for this breath and show them." The higher the ambition, the greater the confidence, and the more courage. With the encouragement and help of the Party organization and comrades, Bao Xudong tried continuously for a week, and finally designed a double-set extractor using three iron oil drums that originally contained petroleum jelly. The extraction principle is exactly the same as the foreign-method Soxhlet extractor, and the efficiency is more than doubled compared with the foreign method, and the consumption of petroleum ether is reduced by about half. Many people praised the extractor with its extraordinary effect.
    Bao Xudong is just one of the nineteen pioneers. The other eighteen are much younger than him, and their educational level is about the same as his. Most of them were originally workers who pulled glass vials and packaged medicine powder. In this battle, they experienced a technical test and an ideological test. Many people grew up in these tests and advanced step by step. Once the diosgenin extraction problem was solved, the experimental work was fully launched, and the difficulties became more and more numerous.
    A young man named Bao Yongting, only in his twenties, was transferred to the trial production team to be in charge of oxidation work. Several accidents occurred at the beginning. Once, during oxidation, he ruined the only few hundred cubic centimeters of intermediate in the entire factory, and these few hundred cubic centimeters of intermediate were extracted from hundreds of kilograms of plant raw materials. The plants were from far away, the yield was low, and they could not be obtained temporarily. Bao Yongting felt extremely sad. Thinking that his "clumsy hands" were not worthy of doing this fine technical work, he said to the team leader Yuan Shoushui with tears in his eyes: "I have never touched these things before, let someone else do it." Team leader Yuan Shoushui fully understood Xiao Bao's mood. He also knew that Xiao Bao did not really want to retreat. Xiao Bao now needed the support and help of others. Yuan Shoushui encouraged him: "Don't be afraid, now the workers in the entire factory are not familiar with 'Cortisone.' If you don't persist, others will come to do it, and it will cause accidents to start over. Although you have had several accidents, you have learned your lesson, and that's good." With the encouragement of the team leader, Bao Yongting immediately expressed his determination to continue. He first worked with others, and spared time to study hard. Later, not only could he work independently in fungal oxidation, and he did not have a single accident in several months, but also because his technical skills grew quickly, the leadership also transferred three workers to study with him and be his assistants!
    After clearing away all kinds of ideological obstacles and overcoming all kinds of technical difficulties, after one trial after another and one failure after another, the nineteen people worked hard together every day. A few days before National Day last year, after more than one hundred and seventy failures, they finally made one and a half kilograms of white "Cortisone" crystals. This is truly the crystallization of hard work and the crystallization of wisdom. This team was also selected as a national advanced collective and attended the National Congress of Heroes. But today, as long as you talk to them about this achievement, everyone will say: "This is not the credit of our nineteen people, but the crystallization of the spirit of communist cooperation." Yes, when they were at a loss, the engineers and experts from the Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Shanghai Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry repeatedly helped them to find experimental technical routes and production process routes; when they felt that the factory's equipment was not enough, the Shanghai No. 3 Pharmaceutical Factory extended a hand of friendship to them and gave them part of the equipment in their factory that produced antibiotics to make "Cortisone." The General Pharmaceutical Factory itself was very small. Later, when they added equipment, there was nowhere to put it, and the No. 3 Pharmaceutical Factory also vacated factory buildings to support them. It is precisely because in this battle to attack the peak, a fighting whole was formed from all directions that things that predecessors could not do were done.

    攻光记

    国产激素药品“可的松”在上海开始成批生产了。去年国庆节前，这个消息从上海通用药厂传出来的时候，许多人感到又兴奋又惊奇。人们兴奋的是：这种国际上近年来才出现的高级药品，我国也会制造了。制造这种药品的通用药厂，原来是一个“弄堂工厂”，而抹掉我国医药工业上这个“空白点”的人，又是十九个普通工人。看来，似乎是一件不可思议的事情。可是，这些闯将怀着一颗为国争光的雄心大志，经过一百七十多次的失败，终于攻下了这个尖端技术的堡垒，创造了神话般的奇迹。
    在激素药品中，“可的松”真是一种重要药品了，它可以治疗二十多种病症，像用抗菌素都无法医治的特种毒性肺炎、支气管哮喘、手术后的休克等，用“可的松”都可以收到显著的效果。“可的松”是激素中的尖端品种，技术要求非常复杂。在1958年大跃进当中，通用药厂的工人们立下了雄心大志，决心使自己的工厂成为我国攀登激素高峰的尖兵。1958年底，这场攻尖战在通用药厂开始了。工人们干劲很足，可是当时工厂里为这场战斗准备了些什么条件呢？一，没有专用设备；二，没有技术资料，即使有些参考用的图表，大家拿来一看，上面也是密密麻麻的化学方程式，用工人们的话说，它们认得我们，我们不认得它们。大家一边看，一边摇头。工厂党总支为此专门开了会，决定由总支书记亲自挂帅，先组织几个共产党员、共青团员、生产积极分子，成立一个试制小组。这样一来，群众情绪高涨起来了。有的说：“要攀登世界先进技术的高峰，本来就像攀登崇山峻岭一样，总是要有困难的，否则就不叫登高了。”几个共青团员劲头更足，说道：“世界上的事情哪一样不是人闯出来的，外国能做，我们为什么不能做？”
    万事开头难，这句话一点不错。开始的时候，这个厂在科学部门的帮助下，做出了一点点“可的松”的晶体，已经碰到了不少困难。后来要把这点点东西扩大为工业生产，严重困难那就更多了。要大量生产“可的松”，先要做出一种叫皂素的中间原料。按照一般方法，它一定要用一种叫连氏提取器的设备来进行这种中间体的提取工作。但是这种提取器要耗用大量钢板，而且做成后，抽一公斤皂素，却要损耗二三十公斤的石油醚。石油醚又是一种容易挥发的危险性原料，用得过多，生产不安全，对人体也有害。这个问题在整个“可的松”生产过程中还只是第一步，这一关突不破，以后的几步合成工作也就势必全部停止。
    谁也没想到，厂里的一个五十五岁的老工人鲍序栋，却在这个关节眼上做了一名出色的开路先锋。鲍序栋在一个研究所里看到了那种连氏提取器后，也感到不经济不合用，一心一意想自己做一个。他过去虽然在制药厂工作了三十多年，可是日常做的都是些分装配料工作，后来也没有做过什么设计工作，这一次，这个老工人真是敢想敢做，不管自己刚刚摘掉文盲帽子，每天回到家里，照样拿起笔来就画，画画不行，重新再来。他老伴劝他：“就是要设计，也用不着这样心急，何必弄得这样紧张。”他说：“紧张辛苦，我都不怕，就是不能受气。”这个没头没脑的回答弄得他老伴以为他是在和谁赌气。一问，他笑了：“是不能受帝国主义的气呀，他们硬说我们不可能很快就制造出‘可的松’，我们一定要争这口气，做给他们看看。”志气愈高，信心愈大，勇气就愈足。鲍序栋在党组织和同志们的鼓励帮助下，接连试了一个星期，最后利用三只原来盛放凡士林的铁油桶，设计成功了一台双套式提取器。抽提原理和洋办法速氏提取器完全一样，效率还比洋办法提高了一倍多，石油醚的损耗减少了一半左右。许多人看到这台功效异常的提取器，个个称赞。
    鲍序栋只是十九个闯将中的一个，另外的十八个，年纪比他轻得多，文化水平可和他差不多。其中绝大部分原来都是拉拉玻璃针瓶、包包药品药粉的工人。他们在这场战斗中，经历着一场技术上的考验，又经受了一场思想上的考验。许多人在这些考验中成长起来了，一步步登高前进。提取皂素问题一解决，试验工作就全面展开了，而困难也越来越多。
    有一个叫鲍永听的小伙子，年龄只二十多岁，调到试制小组，担任氧化工作。一开始就出了几次事故。一次在氧化时，竟把全厂仅有的几百公分中间体弄坏了，而这几百公分的中间体是从几百公斤植物原料中提炼出来的。这些植物产地又远，产量又少，一时又来不了。鲍永听心里难过极了，一想自己这样的“笨手笨脚”，不配做这种精细的技术工作，噙着眼泪对小组长袁守水说：“这些东西过去碰都没有碰到过，还是让别人去做吧。”小鲍有这种心情，小组长袁守水是完全理解的。他也知道小鲍并不是真正愿意打退堂鼓，小鲍现在正需要别人的支持和帮助。袁守水鼓励他说：“不要怕，现在全厂工人对‘可的松’都不熟悉，你不坚持下去，别人来干，要重新开头，也会出事故。你虽然出了几次事故，可是接受了教训，这就好了。”鲍永听在小组长的鼓励下，当场表示坚决干下去。他先跟别人一起操作，自己抽空苦苦钻研，后来不但在霉菌氧化方面能够独立工作，几个月里没有出过一次事故，而且由于技术上成长得快，领导上还调了三个工人跟他学习，当他的助手哩！
    扫除了种种思想上的障碍，克服了种种技术上的困难，一次又一次的试验，一次又一次的失败，十九个人就这样天天在一起埋头苦干，在去年国庆节前几天，他们经过了一百七十多次的失败，终于做出了一公斤半洁白的“可的松”晶体。这真是心血的结晶，又是智慧的结晶。这个小组还被评选为全国先进集体，出席了全国群英大会。但在今天，只要你和他们一谈到这个成就，他们个个都会这样说：“这不是我们十九个人的功劳，而是共产主义大协作精神的结晶。”是的，在他们茫无头绪的时候，中国科学院有机化学研究所、上海医药工业研究所的工程师、专家们，曾经多次帮助他们一起寻找试验技术路线和生产工艺路线；当他们感到厂里设备不够的时候，上海第三制药厂向他们伸出了友谊的手，把自己厂里生产抗菌素的一部分设备让出来给他们做“可的松”。通用药厂自己工厂很小，后来添置设备，无处可放，第三制药厂还腾出厂房来支援他们。正因为在这场攻尖战斗中，四面八方结成了一个战斗整体，才做出了这种前人所做不到的事情。
