Spring drought has always been a major enemy of agricultural production. Currently, parts of the north and south have enthusiastically launched drought prevention and resistance movements, with millions of laborers holding the firm belief of "ensuring a bumper harvest even if it doesn't rain all spring," and are fighting heroically against the drought with soaring enthusiasm.

Our farmers have rich experience in fighting drought and have achieved many successes. Now, with the people's communes, such a highly collectivized and powerful organization, and with far more farmland water conservancy projects than in the past, overcoming drought is definitely certain. The main issue is how to strive for the initiative, fully utilize this unprecedentedly favorable condition, mobilize strong manpower and resources, and eliminate drought as soon as it appears, or prevent it in advance when it is likely to occur, thereby ensuring the smooth growth of summer crops such as wheat and rapeseed, and ensuring the timely progress of spring planting.

To expand the irrigated area and defeat the spring drought as early as possible, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive inspection of all existing water conservancy engineering equipment. For those lacking auxiliary projects, quickly add them to make the projects complete; for those with poor quality, quickly repair and reinforce them; for those lacking water lifting machinery and tools, quickly manufacture them. Only in this way can all projects exert the greatest irrigation benefits in drought prevention and resistance. In some areas, especially in a few so-called "water conservancy dead corners," it is still necessary to devote a certain amount of effort in the spring to continue building some water conservancy projects that will benefit that year, to enhance the ability to resist disasters.

Whether the problem of water source and rational water use can be solved is an important factor in determining the effect of drought prevention and resistance. In order to have a clear understanding, it is necessary to calculate a water account, to see how much water is needed, how much water is still lacking, how to save water, and how to tap more water sources. From the recent development of the movement, it can be seen that new creations are emerging one after another in the tapping of water sources and rational water use, fully demonstrating the infinite wisdom of the highly organized laboring farmers. The Majiawan Management District of Gaoling People's Commune in Sanyuan County, Shaanxi Province, erected pulley blocks on the plateau and pulled iron wires one by one on the bank of the Wei River below the plateau, and finally pulled the water of the Wei River up to the arid plateau to irrigate a large amount of wheat fields. Since even the Loess Plateau, which has been dry for a long time, can solve the water source problem, it is even less of a problem for other areas with better conditions to tap more water sources. It is very clear that whether sufficient water can be obtained depends on boosting morale and boldly mobilizing the masses. As long as the morale is high enough and the creative wisdom of the masses is fully utilized, water sources that were previously thought impossible to use can also be utilized through efforts.

Having water is not enough; one must also know how to use it. With the same amount of water, if it is used properly, more farmland can be irrigated. Therefore, we should cherish water sources, manage and use them scientifically, and strive to ensure that every drop of water returns to the fields. Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, has adopted the method of diverting water from branch canals, raising the water level, circulating water, and using water in a planned manner on five dry canals, which irrigates 24,000 mu more farmland per day than in the past when water was released at the same time.

In addition to vigorously carrying out irrigation, doing a good job in farmland moisture conservation is also an important measure for drought prevention and resistance. If the soil moisture of spring-sown farmland is well protected, the water can be saved and used in the summer crop fields that need watering the most. Linqing City, Shandong Province, has summarized its experience in moisture conservation over the past few years and has taken six measures: "harrowing, hoeing, tamping, rolling, irrigating, and leveling," and has completed 98% of the spring farmland preparation and moisture conservation work in a concentrated manner. This experience should be taken seriously by all regions.

Widely developing cooperation in the drought prevention and resistance movement and vigorously organizing various departments to support the people's communes are important conditions for overcoming disasters. Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, under the slogan of "the whole county is a chessboard, cooperating to fight against spring drought," has taken measures such as giving priority to water use on the plateau over water use below the plateau, and giving priority to areas with less water over areas with more water, so that the flow of the Weihe Canal plateau pumped irrigation canal has increased from 4.5 cubic meters per second to 9.5 cubic meters per second, expanding the irrigated area of wheat fields on the arid plateau, while the irrigation progress below the plateau continues to accelerate. The drought prevention and resistance struggle must have sufficient materials and equipment. In addition to relying on the people's communes for self-reliance in production, it also needs external support. Recently, the leading organs in many areas are organizing industrial, commercial, transportation and other departments to accelerate the manufacture, allocation and supply of drainage and irrigation machinery and small water lifting tools to support the drought resistance struggle. This is very necessary.

### 鼓足干劲抗旱防旱

    鼓足干劲抗旱防旱
    春旱，历来是农业生产的大敌。目前，北方和南方的一部分地区已经热烈地展开了防旱抗旱运动，千百万劳动大军抱着“一春无雨也要保丰收”的必胜信念，鼓起冲天干劲，正在同干旱进行着英勇的斗争。
    我国农民对于同干旱作斗争，有着丰富的经验，也取得了许多成就。现在，有了人民公社这样高度集体化的、强大的组织，又有了比过去多得不可比拟的农田水利工程，战胜干旱，更是肯定无疑的。主要的问题是如何力争主动，充分利用这种空前有利的大好条件，调动强大的人力物力，在旱象刚一露头的时候就把它消灭掉，或者在旱象可能发生的时候就预先防止它，从而保证小麦、油菜等夏收作物顺利生长，保证春播工作适时进行。
    为了扩大灌溉面积，及早战胜春旱，有必要对现有的全部水利工程设备作一次全面的检查。缺少辅助工程的，赶快添修，使工程成套；质量较差的，赶快整修加固；缺少提水机械和工具的，赶快制造。只有这样，才能使全部工程在防旱抗旱中发挥最大的灌溉效益。有些地区，特别是少数所谓“水利死角”地区，在春天还需要拿出一定的力量继续兴建一部分当年受益的水利工程，增强抗灾力量。
    能不能解决水源和合理用水问题，是决定防旱抗旱效果大小的重要一环。为要做到心中有数，需要算一算水账，看看需要多少水，还缺少多少水，怎样节约用水，怎样挖掘更多的水源。从最近运动的发展可以看出，在挖掘水源和合理用水方面，新的创造层出不穷，充分显示了高度组织起来的劳动农民的无穷智慧。陕西三原县高陵人民公社马家湾管理区在原上搭起滑车，在原下的渭河边拉起一条一条的铁线，终于把渭河的水拉上旱原来，浇了大量麦田。既然像这样久旱无雨的黄土高原都能解决水源问题，那么其他条件较好的地区，要挖掘出更多的水源，就更不成问题了。事情很明显，能不能取得足够的用水，关键在于鼓足干劲，放手发动群众。只要干劲鼓得十足，充分发挥群众的创造智慧，原先以为不可能利用的水源，经过努力，也就可以利用起来。
    有了水，还得会用。同是那么多的水，用之得当，就可以灌溉更多的农田。所以，应该十分珍惜水源，科学地管理和使用，力求做到滴水归田。山东寿张县在五条干渠上采取分渠截流、抬高水位、循环放水、有计划地用水的办法，比过去同时放水，每天多浇两万四千亩农田。
    除了大力进行灌溉以外，做好农田保墒工作，也是重要的防旱抗旱措施。如果春播农田的土壤墒水保护的好，就可以把用水节省下来，用在最需要浇水的夏收作物田里。山东临清市总结了几年来的保墒经验，采取了“耙、耪、砸、轧、灌、平”六项措施，已将98％的春田整地保墒工作突击完成。这个经验应当引起各地重视。
    在防旱抗旱运动中广泛发展协作，大力组织各部门支援人民公社，是战胜灾害的重要条件，陕西兴平县在“全县一盘棋，协作战春旱”的口号下，采取原下用水服从原上用水、水多地区服从水少地区等措施，使渭惠渠高原抽水灌溉渠道的流量由每秒四点五公方增加到九点五公方，扩大了旱原上的麦田灌溉面积，同时原下的灌溉进度仍然不断加快。防旱抗旱斗争必须有足够的物资器材，这些东西除了靠人民公社自力生产外，还需要外力的支援。最近不少地区领导机关正在组织工业、商业、运输等部门，加速排灌机械和小型提水工具制造、调拨和供应工作，支援抗旱斗争。这是十分必要的。
