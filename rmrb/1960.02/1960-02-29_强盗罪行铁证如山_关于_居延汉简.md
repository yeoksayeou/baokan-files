    Robber's Crimes are Conclusive
    On the "Juyan Han Slips"
    The Juyan Han Slips were discovered in 1930 at the site of the Han Dynasty Juyan beacon towers in the Ejin River basin of Ejin Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The total number is more than 10,000. Most of them date from the sixth year of Emperor Zhao's Shiyuan era (81 BC) to the fourth year of Emperor Cheng's He Ping era (25 BC), and the latest is the seventh year of Emperor He of the Eastern Han Dynasty Yongyuan (95 AD). The material is made of wood or bamboo, which was a widely popular form of public and private writing before paper was used in China more than 2,000 years ago. From these Han slips, we can examine the ancient slip and tablet system.
    The content of the Juyan Han Slips is very rich. It contains detailed records of the military facilities, postal transport and horses, agricultural production, soldiers' lives, organization and equipment on the frontier at that time. It is a valuable source of information for studying the forms of land ownership, the price of goods and the living standards of residents, and the members and status of soldiers in the Han Dynasty. The Han slips also contain a small number of medical prescriptions and records of illnesses, which are important materials for studying the history of ancient Chinese medicine.
    Books copied in the slips, such as the Book of Documents, the Analects, and the Emergency Chapters, differ in many respects from modern texts; there are also records of calendars and divination, which can show the calendar and customs of the time.
    The format of Han Dynasty official documents can also be seen from the slips. Some common idioms and expressions at that time were often used in the slips, which is very helpful for studying ancient linguistics.
    On the eve of the Anti-Japanese War, the Chiang Kai-shek group transferred all the Juyan Han Slips out of Beijing. Later, they were seized by the American imperialists and are now in the Library of Congress in the United States, and have not yet been returned. We are now studying the Juyan Han Slips, but we can only rely on some incomplete photos and cannot see the real objects, which is really infuriating! The Juyan Han Slips are an important historical and cultural heritage of our country, and we will never allow American imperialism to seize them under any pretext!

### 强盗罪行铁证如山  关于“居延汉简”

    强盗罪行铁证如山
    关于“居延汉简”
    居延汉简是1930年在今内蒙古自治区额济纳旗额济纳河流域的汉代居延烽燧遗址中发现的，总数有一万余片。其年代大部分是昭帝始元六年（公元前八十一年）至成帝河平四年（公元前二十五年），最晚的是东汉和帝永元七年（公元九十五年）。质料是以木制或竹制的，这是我国在二千多年以前未使用纸张时广泛流行的公私简牍。我们从这些汉简中，可以考见古代的简牍制度。
    居延汉简的内容，是十分丰富的。它对当时边塞上的军事设施、驿传车马情况、屯田生产、士兵的生活、组织和装备等等，都有详细的记载。对研究两汉土地占有形态，塞上物价与居民的生活水平，士兵的成员及其身分等，都是十分宝贵的资料。汉简中还有少数的医方及病情的记载，是研究我国古代医学史的重要资料。
    简中抄写的书籍，如尚书、论语、急就章等等，与今文多有出入；还有历谱、术数一类的记载，可以看出当时的历法和风俗的习惯。
    汉人的公文程式，也可由简中看出。当时流行的一些习惯语、成语，都经常在简中沿用，对研究古代语言学，很有帮助。
    抗日战争前夕，蒋介石集团把全部居延汉简由北京展转运出。后被美帝国主义劫持在美国国会图书馆，至今不还。我们现在正在研究居延汉简，但只能根据一些不完整的照片，却看不到实物，实在令人愤恨！居延汉简是我国的重要历史文化遗产，决不容许美帝国主义假借任何名义加以霸占！
