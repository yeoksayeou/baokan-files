　　Our country has a long history and a splendid culture. The Chinese people have always been proud of the rich historical and cultural heritage of their motherland.

　　Before liberation, due to the collusion of foreign colonialism and internal feudal forces, our country fell into a semi-feudal and semi-colonial state. Not only was it subjected to continuous aggression by imperialism in politics, economy, and military affairs, but it was also severely damaged in culture. Especially American imperialism, which has always used despicable means to plunder and destroy our country's cultural relics, causing extremely serious damage to our country's cultural heritage. The Chinese people will never forget this crime of imperialism.

　　After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people stood up. The American aggressors have no way to act on the mainland of the motherland, but they are trying every means to rob a large number of precious cultural relics that were stolen from our country to Taiwan by the Chiang Kai-shek group on the eve of liberation.

　　In 1955, the American ruling group, through Horace Jayne, director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the United States, "suggested" that the Chiang Kai-shek group "lend" important cultural relics and books from our country in Taiwan to the United States, and shamelessly said that the American robbery of these Chinese collections "is an unavoidable international obligation." After the news came, it aroused widespread indignation and protests among the Chinese people, and the American aggressors temporarily shrank back their greedy black hands.

　　Now, the US imperialists are openly using the US State Department to attempt to plunder the cultural heritage of 650 million Chinese people in Taiwan under the pretext of "exhibition." This shameless conspiracy of the US imperialists is what we resolutely oppose.

　　On the eve of liberation, a large number of cultural relics stolen to Taiwan by the Chiang Kai-shek group were the crystallization of our country's historical culture. The most important ones are as follows:

　　More than 25,000 pieces of inscribed oracle bones unearthed from the Yin Ruins of Anyang are important materials for studying the history of the Yin Dynasty in our country.

　　Bronzes, jade articles, pottery, and stone carvings unearthed from the Yin Dynasty tombs in Houjiazhuang, Anyang, and the Zhou Dynasty tombs in Xincun, Junxian County, Shanbiaozhen, Jixian County, and Liulige, Huixian County are all rare treasures for studying Yin and Zhou culture.

　　All the essence of the Palace Museum, the former Central Museum, and the former Central Library, including bronzes, jade articles, porcelain, calligraphy and painting, silk tapestries, lacquerware, books, and archives, including the Mao Gong Ding, which is cast with an inscription as long as 449 characters, and other heavy objects, Song, Yuan, and Ming rare books, and more than 130,000 volumes of the Siku Quanshu in Wenyuan Pavilion, are all important materials for studying ancient Chinese history, culture, and art.

　　These cultural relics are the cultural wealth created by the Chinese people for thousands of years, and no one is allowed to plunder and destroy them.

　　The American ruling group is inherently aggressive. Its imperialist nature, under the guise of "peace" lately, is not only intensifying its military, political, and economic aggression around the world, but also frantically promoting its cultural aggression policy. The current facts prove this.

　　For ten years, US imperialism has occupied Taiwan, our country's territory, and has been carrying out military provocations against our country in the Taiwan region. Today, it openly attempts to use its warships to rob our country's precious cultural relics in Taiwan.

　　This aggressive crime of US imperialism cannot but arouse increasingly strong anger among the Chinese people. We believe that the people of the world are also increasingly clearly aware of the robber face of US imperialism. We warn the American ruling group: Taiwan is the territory of the People's Republic of China, and all armed forces must be withdrawn from the Taiwan region; the cultural relics in Taiwan are the historical and cultural heritage of the Chinese people, and no robbery is allowed. Even if they are robbed to the ends of the earth, the Chinese people will surely追回recover them. At the same time, we warn the Chiang Kai-shek group: they must stop all treasonous acts and immediately stop the shameful act of selling the cultural heritage of the motherland; all cultural relics stolen to Taiwan must be returned to the people of the motherland completely intact when Taiwan is liberated.

　　We hope that all patriotic people and cultural workers in Taiwan will take up their responsibilities and, together with the people of the whole country, prevent the US imperialists from robbing our country's cultural wealth and the Chiang Kai-shek group from selling the criminal acts of the motherland's cultural heritage!

　　We hope that the American people and the people of all countries in the world who have a sense of justice and love peace will condemn and stop the aggressive activities and robber behavior of the American ruling group for the glory of the American people and the happiness of mankind in the world.

　　Finally, we solemnly declare that any "agreements" and "contracts" concluded between US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek group to rob and sell our country's cultural relics are completely invalid!

    戴着“和平”面具的强盗
    郭沫若
    我国有着悠久的历史和灿烂的文化。我国人民一向对祖国丰富的历史文化遗产感到自豪。
    在解放前，由于外来的殖民主义和内在的封建势力苟合，使我国陷入了半封建半殖民地的状态，不仅在政治上、经济上、军事上受到帝国主义不断的侵略，而且在文化上也受到严重的侵害。特别是美帝国主义，一贯使用卑鄙手段，劫夺和破坏我国文物，使我国的文化遗产受到极其严重的损害。帝国主义的这种罪行，我国人民是永远不能忘记的。
    解放以后，在中国共产党领导下，中国人民站起来了。美国侵略者在祖国大陆上已无计可施，却千方百计地企图劫夺我国在解放前夕被蒋介石集团盗运到台湾的大批珍贵文物。
    1955年美国统治集团曾由美国费城艺术博物馆馆长霍雷斯·杰尼出面，“建议”蒋介石集团以“长期出借”的方式，让美国把我国在台湾的重要文物和图书运走，并且无耻地说美国劫运我国这些珍藏“是一种不可逃避的国际义务”。消息传来以后，激起了我国人民普遍的愤慨和抗议，美国侵略者才暂时缩回了贪婪的黑手。
    现在，美帝国主义者竟公开由美国国务院出面，假借“展览”为名，企图劫夺中国六亿五千万人民在台湾的文化遗产，美帝国主义者这种无耻阴谋，是我们所坚决反对的。
    解放前夕，被蒋介石集团盗运到台湾的大批文物，都是我国历史文化的结晶。举其最重要者而言，有下列种种。
    安阳殷墟出土的刻辞甲骨两万五千多片，是研究我国殷代历史的重要资料。
    安阳侯家庄殷代陵墓和浚县辛村、汲县山彪镇、辉县琉璃阁等地周代墓葬里发掘出来的铜器、玉器、陶器、石刻等，都是研究殷周文化的稀世之珍。
    故宫博物院、前中央博物院和前中央图书馆所藏的全部精华，计有铜器、玉器、瓷器、书画、缂丝、漆器、图书、档案等，其中包括铸有铭文长达四百四十九个字的毛公鼎及其它大批重器，宋、元、明善本书籍和文渊阁四库全书等十三万多册，它们都是研究我国古代历史、文化和艺术的重要资料。
    这许多文物是数千年来我国人民所创造的文化财富，决不允许任何人劫夺和破坏。
    美国统治集团侵略成性，它的帝国主义本质，近来在“和平”伪装的掩盖下，不仅在全世界范围内加紧它的军事、政治和经济上的侵略，而且还疯狂地推行它的文化侵略政策。当前的事实正是证明。
    十年来美帝国主义霸占着我国领土台湾，不断地在台湾地区向我国进行军事挑衅，而今天又公然企图用它的军舰劫走我国在台湾的珍贵文物了。
    美帝国主义的这种侵略罪行，不能不引起我国人民越来越强烈的愤怒。我们相信全世界人民也是越来越清楚地认识了美帝国主义的强盗面貌。我们警告美国统治集团：台湾是中华人民共和国的领土，必须从台湾地区撤出所有的武装；在台湾的文物，是中国人民的历史文化遗产，决不允许劫夺，即使被劫到天涯海角，中国人民也一定把它们追回。我们同时警告蒋介石集团：必须停止一切卖国行为，立即停止出卖祖国文化遗产的可耻勾当；盗运到台湾去的所有文物，必须在台湾解放时完整无缺地全部交还祖国人民。
    我们希望在台湾的所有爱国的人民和文化工作者，负起自己的责任来，和全国人民一起，阻止美帝国主义盗劫我国文化财富和蒋介石集团出卖祖国文化遗产的罪恶行为！
    我们希望具有正义感的、爱好和平的美国人民和世界各国人民，为了美国人民的光荣和世界人类的幸福，对于美国统治集团的侵略活动和强盗行为，一律加以谴责和制止。
    最后我们严正声明：美帝国主义和蒋介石集团之间所订立的任何盗劫、出卖我国文物的“协议”和“合同”全属无效！
