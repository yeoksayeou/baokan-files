The Chinese People are Making Life Better Through Collective Effort.
Nothing Can Stop Them From Advancing at the Fastest Possible Speed.
"Canadian Forum" Editor Clark Publishes Impressions of His Visit to China.

“Before, no one cared for us, and we would have died silently. Now, thanks to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have a happy life.”

These are the words of an old peasant woman, her face full of the wrinkles etched by decades of suffering and poverty, but her voice was strong and affirmative, and full of emotion. We were standing in a simply furnished room in a commune in northern Hubei Province. This brick house is a new “House of Respect for the Elderly,” of which there are currently thousands throughout China.

We had just visited a kindergarten, where a group of children lined up to sing for us the song that children everywhere in China sing: "Socialism is Good." Their bright eyes shone with excitement, and they were as healthy and well cared for as children you see anywhere else.

“Socialism is good… now, thanks to the Communist Party, we have a happy life.” This is the simple message that China today sends to all the oppressed and hungry people of Asia and Africa, and no force in the world can stop its revolutionary and far-reaching influence.

In all these populous countries, where else can the people claim to have a "happy life"?

Russell Baker, a "New York Times" reporter who accompanied President Eisenhower on his visit to Pakistan last month, vividly described the poverty in Asia. On December 8th, he described the President's arrival in Karachi:

"Along the ten-mile road he traveled, thousands upon thousands of people were crammed together, all dressed in their best clothes for the festival. Among these people were thousands of children, many without shoes, their legs as thin as toothpicks, wearing dirty and tattered clothes. ..."

This is what President Eisenhower saw in Karachi.

But if he and his accompanying reporters had gone to China as I did last autumn, they would have seen something very different indeed. They would have seen children wearing shoes, their clothes not tattered or dirty, but neat and clean, their legs chubby, not like toothpicks. They would have seen no beggars or prostitutes on the streets.

Simply put, they would have found that the Chinese people today have enough clothes to wear. (China's current cotton production ranks second in the world.) They do eat three meals a day, with rice and vegetables as their staple food, which in itself marks a leap forward unheard of in other Asian countries.

But, we also visited the new suburbs of Shanghai. Here, as in all other cities in China, people see new apartment buildings being built in all directions. In a new industrial town near Shanghai, we saw forty-seven such large buildings already habitable. These buildings were built on land where rice was growing just ninety days ago. They are a typical example of the truly remarkable construction speed in China today, made possible by the tireless hard physical labor of thousands of people and the adoption of highly modern prefabricated components.

When our delegation arrived in Henan Province, we were told that it had not rained for a hundred days. People also told us that there had been a drought in 1942, which was neither as long nor as widespread. Yet, that year 400,000 people starved to death.

Today, no one is starving in Henan, and no one misses a meal. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, 100,000 farmers from the communes and cadres and workers from the cities worked together to fight the drought. They used all kinds of methods to draw water from rivers, lakes and reservoirs. If there were electric pumps, they used pumps. If not, they used animal-drawn carts. If there were no animal-drawn carts, they carried it by hand. We saw the fruits of their labor in the lush, mature rice crops. These crops are expected to be even better than last year's bumper harvest.

Thus, the new communes, in their first year of existence, have proved their value as the most effective form of organization for the collective utilization of large amounts of labor, for irrigation and water conservancy projects, and for facilitating the promotion of scientific farming methods.

As a result, the Chinese people have escaped the nightmare of hunger, misfortune and war, and entered a situation where the workers tell you that they are living in paradise compared to the past. Yet, even as they say this, they go on to say that they are very well aware that what they have achieved so far is only a beginning.

They understand that through their collective efforts, they can make life better. Nothing can stop them from joining forces and advancing at the fastest possible speed to achieve a prosperous life. They know that with their country's vast human and natural resources, they are able to provide such a prosperous life.

With each leap forward they make in industrial and agricultural production, in their living standards, and in their cultural achievements, the contrast between their country and the Asian and African countries still under capitalist and imperialist rule becomes more and more obvious.

The main point about China, the "secret" of all these great achievements, is that the Chinese working class has seized power, the country is under the leadership of the Communist Party, and is building socialism.

Therefore, day after day and year after year, China proves through living examples the unparalleled superiority of socialism over capitalism, that socialism is not only "suitable" for Europe, but also "suitable" for Asia, and that it is the sure path forward for all underdeveloped countries.

### 中国人民通过集体的努力使得生活更加美好  没有任何东西能阻止他们用尽快的速度前进  “加拿大论坛报”总编辑克拉克发表访华观感

    中国人民通过集体的努力使得生活更加美好
    没有任何东西能阻止他们用尽快的速度前进
    “加拿大论坛报”总编辑克拉克发表访华观感
    “从前，没有人照管我们，我们本来会无声无息地死去。现在，感谢共产党和毛主席，我们有了幸福的生活。”
    这是一个老农妇的话，她的脸上满是几十年的痛苦和贫困所刻下的纹，但是她的声音是有力而肯定，并且充满了感情。我们是站在湖北省北部一个公社的一间家具很简单的房间里，这所砖瓦房子是一所新的“敬老院”，目前在全中国有数以千计的这种“敬老院”。
    我们刚访问了一个幼儿园，在那里一群孩子排成队为我们唱中国到处的孩子都唱的那支歌：“社会主义好”。他们的明亮的眼睛兴奋的发着光，他们像你在任何别的地方看到的孩子一样的健康并且得到很好的照顾。
    “社会主义好……现在，感谢共产党，我们有了幸福的生活。”这是今天中国向亚洲和非洲的一切受压迫和饥饿的人民发出的简单的信息，世界上没有任何力量能够阻止它的革命性的深远影响。
    在所有这些人口众多的国家中，还有哪里的人民能够说得上“幸福的生活”呢？
    上月随同艾森豪威尔总统访问巴基斯坦的“纽约时报”记者鲁塞尔·贝克很生动地叙说了亚洲的贫困情况。12月8日他描写总统到达卡拉奇的情况说：
    “在他经过的十英里长的道路两旁，挤满了成千上万的人，他们全都为了这个节日而穿上他们最好的服装。这些人当中有数以千计的孩子，很多没有鞋子，小腿细得像牙签一样，穿着肮脏破烂的衣服。……”
    这就是艾森豪威尔总统在卡拉奇所看到的。
    但是，如果他和他的随行记者像我去年秋天那样到中国去的话，他们将会看到确实是非常不同的东西。他们会看到孩子们穿着鞋子、他们的衣服不破烂也不肮脏，而是整齐、干净的，他们的小腿是胖胖的，不像牙签。他们将会看到街上没有乞丐，也没有妓女。
    简单的说，他们将会发现中国人民今天有足够的衣服穿。（中国现在的棉布生产量占世界第二位）他们确实每天吃三餐，有大米和蔬菜作为主食，这件事本身就标志着在亚洲其他国家从来没听说过的一个跃进。
    但是，我们也访问了上海的新的郊区。这里，同中国其他所有城市一样，人们看到四面八方兴建起新的公寓式的建筑。在上海近郊一个新的工业市镇里，我们看到了四十七个这样大片的建筑物已经可以住人了。这些建筑物的地方仅仅在九十天以前还长着稻子。它们是今天中国真正令人注目的建筑速度的典型例子，其所以可能是由于成千上万的人进行不懈的艰苦的体力劳动，并且采用了高度现代化的预制构件的办法。
    当我们的代表团到达河南省的时候，人们告诉我们已经有一百天没有下雨了。人们还对我们说，1942年有过一次旱灾，时间也没有这样长，面积也没有这样广。然而，那一年有四十万人饿死。
    今天在河南没有一个人挨饿，也没有一个人缺一顿饭。在共产党的领导下，十万名来自公社的农民和来自城市的干部和工人齐力抗旱。他们用各种办法从河流、湖泊和水库里取水。如果有电力抽水机就用抽水机。如果没有就用兽力车拉。如果没有兽力车就用手提。我们从青葱的、成熟的稻子作物中看到了他们劳动的成果。这些作物预料比去年的丰收年成还要好些。
    因此，新的公社在它存在的第一年就证明了它们作为最有效地集体利用大量劳动力、进行灌溉和水利工程、以及便于推广科学耕作方法的这一组织形式的价值。
    从而中国人民已经摆脱了饥饿、不幸和战争的恶梦，进入了工人们告诉你的同过去相比现在他们是住在天堂里的那种境地。然而，即使他们这样对你说，他们还会接着说，他们非常清楚地知道，他们迄今所取得的成就仅仅是一个开始。
    他们懂得了通过他们集体的努力能够使得生活更加美好。没有任何东西能够阻止他们合力地用尽快的速度前进以取得富裕生活。他们知道，以他们国家的巨大的人力和天然资源，是能够提供这种富裕的生活的。
    随着他们在工农业生产上、在他们的生活水平上、在他们的文化成就上的每一个跃进，他们的国家同仍然处于资本主义和帝国主义统治之下的亚非国家的对比更加明显了。
    关于中国的情况的主要之点，也就是所有这些巨大成就的“秘密”，就在于中国的工人阶级掌握了政权，这个国家是在共产党的领导之下，并且正在建设社会主义。
    因此，日复一日和年复一年地，中国通过活生生的例子证明社会主义对资本主义的无比优越性，社会主义不仅“适用”于欧洲，而且“适用”于亚洲，这是一切不发达国家前进的稳当的道路。
