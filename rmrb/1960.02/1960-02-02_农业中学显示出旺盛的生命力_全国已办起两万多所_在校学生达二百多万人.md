Xinhua News Agency, January 1st – Agricultural middle schools, which emerged during the Great Leap Forward, have continued to be consolidated and improved over the past year under the leadership and support of the Party, becoming an important component of China's overall education undertaking.

　　Agricultural middle schools have shown their vigorous vitality from the very beginning. Since their initial establishment in Jiangsu and other provinces in 1958, they have quickly been promoted throughout the country. According to incomplete statistics, more than 20,000 agricultural middle schools have been established nationwide, with more than 60,000 teachers and over 2,190,000 students. With the strong support of Party committees at all levels, agricultural middle schools in various regions have started from scratch over the past year, building schools while learning and producing, and have begun to take shape. Most agricultural middle schools have basically solved the problems of teaching and living quarters, established certain production bases, and added some teaching aids, instruments, and books, completing their teaching and production labor plans relatively well.

　　In the past year, agricultural middle schools in various regions have further revised their education plans, adopting forms such as "half-day system" and "every-other-day system" in accordance with local conditions, properly arranging teaching and production labor, and ensuring the timely completion of teaching and labor plans. In terms of curriculum, in addition to politics, language, mathematics, and agricultural knowledge, many agricultural middle schools in various regions have added physics and chemistry courses. With the new rural situation after communization, some agricultural middle schools in Jiangsu, Hebei, Shaanxi, Yunnan and other provinces have set up new courses related to agricultural machinery, rural hydropower, sericulture, etc., to accelerate the training of technical personnel for agricultural modernization. The quality of teaching in agricultural middle schools in various regions is also constantly improving. In 1959, a considerable number of agricultural middle schools in Jiangsu, Fujian, Zhejiang, and other provinces achieved overall average scores in major courses such as mathematics and language in unified examinations with students of the same grade in nearby ordinary middle schools, approaching or catching up with the students of ordinary middle schools.

　　In 1959, under the support of the people's communes, agricultural middle schools in various regions universally established farms and breeding farms. Most agricultural middle schools also established small factories, focusing on sideline occupations (handicrafts) and high-yield cash crops, combining agriculture and sideline occupations, and carrying out production labor activities. Many regions such as Jilin, Liaoning, Shandong, and Jiangsu already have a number of agricultural middle schools that have achieved full or semi-self-sufficiency through the income earned from combining teaching and production labor, and more regions and more agricultural middle schools have achieved partial self-sufficiency. In production labor, teachers and students of agricultural middle schools have embraced great ambitions and lofty aspirations, carrying out many beneficial scientific research activities. The Qingpu County Agricultural Middle School in Shanghai established thirty-four scientific research groups for rice, rapeseed, etc., researching cultivation techniques, summarizing high-yield experiences, and compiling small booklets on the cultivation methods of various crops; some agricultural middle schools in Rugao County, Jiangsu Province, carried out the activity of "hundred acres of experimental fields with a hundred projects." In one year, fifty-four communes in the county successively held more than one hundred on-site meetings at agricultural middle schools, promoting the results of agricultural middle school experiments and research, with a total of 96,000 production team leaders and activist commune members attending to learn. Many agricultural middle schools in various regions have achieved excellent results in planting, breeding, etc., creating a batch of high-yield records. In 1959, four "thousand-catty schools" emerged in Shaanxi Province, setting an example locally.

　　In the past year, agricultural middle schools in various regions have received support from Party committees at all levels in various aspects. Party committees in various regions have included the work of agricultural middle schools on their agendas. In 1959, responsible comrades from the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee and many prefectural and county Party committees visited agricultural middle schools in rural areas many times to help summarize experiences and improve teaching quality. At the same time, they continued to transfer a group of key personnel to serve as leaders in agricultural middle schools and selected a group of experienced old farmers to serve as technical guidance in agricultural middle schools. Educational departments and normal colleges in many regions of the country have also systematically trained agricultural middle school teachers through the establishment of agricultural middle school teacher guidance groups, training schools, and short-term training classes. Jiangsu Province specifically established a teacher training school for agricultural middle schools before the summer vacation last year, drawing more than 1,000 agricultural middle school teachers for training, enabling them to take on the teaching work of second-year courses in agricultural middle schools after the summer vacation. Adapting to the needs of agricultural technical transformation, the education department of Shijiazhuang District, Hebei Province, cooperated with relevant departments around October last year to train 210 agricultural technology teachers. Recently, this province is training 400 teachers to teach agricultural machinery courses for agricultural middle schools.

    农业中学显示出旺盛的生命力 
    全国已办起两万多所  在校学生达二百多万人
    新华社1日讯　在大跃进中出现的农业中学，一年多来在党的领导扶持下，继续得到巩固提高，成为我国整个教育事业中一个重要的组成部分。
    农业中学一开始就显示出它的旺盛的生命力，自从1958年在江苏等省首先创办后，很快就在各地推广。据不完全的统计，全国各地办起的农业中学已有两万多所，教师六万多人，在校学生人数超过二百一十九万。在各级党委的大力支持下，一年多来，各地农业中学白手起家，边学习、边生产、边建校，已初具规模。绝大部分农业中学已基本解决了教学和生活用房，建立起一定的生产基地，添置了一部分教具、仪器、图书，比较好地完成了教学和生产劳动计划。
    在过去的一年中，各地农业中学进一步修订了教育计划，因地制宜地采用“半日制”、“隔日制”等形式，妥善地安排了教学和生产劳动，保证了按时完成教学和劳动计划。课程设置上除政治、语文、数学、农业常识外，不少地区的农业中学已增设了物理、化学课。随着公社化以后的农村新形势，江苏、河北、陕西、云南等省有些农业中学设立了有关农业机械、农村水电、蚕桑等方面的新课，加速为农业现代化培养技术人材。各地农业中学教学质量也在不断提高，1959年，江苏、福建、浙江等省有相当一批农业中学，在和附近普通中学同年级学生实行统一考试中，主要课程如数学、语文等学科的总平均成绩，都已接近或赶上了普通中学学生。
    各地农业中学1959年在人民公社的支持下，普遍举办了农场、饲养场，多数农业中学还办了小型的工厂，以副业（手工业）和高产经济作物为主，农业和副业并举，开展生产劳动活动。吉林、辽宁、山东、江苏等许多地区已有一批农业中学通过结合教学开展生产劳动而获得的收益，达到全部自给或半自给，有更多的地区更多的农业中学做到了部分自给。在生产劳动中，农业中学的师生们抱雄心，立大志，开展了许多有益的科学研究活动。上海市青浦县农业中学成立水稻、油菜等科学研究小组三十四个，研究耕作技术总结丰产经验，还编写了各种作物栽培法的小册子；江苏省如皋县有的农业中学开展了“百亩百项试验田”的活动，一年中全县有五十四个公社先后在农业中学召开了一百多次现场会议，推广农业中学试验研究的成果，先后到会学习的生产队长和社员积极分子总计达九万六千多人次。各地不少农业中学在种植、饲养等方面，获得了优异的成绩，创造了一批高额丰产的纪录，陕西省1959年出现了四个农业中学千斤校，在当地树立了旗帜。
    各地农业中学在过去一年中，得到各级党委从各方面给予的支持。各地党委都把农业中学工作列入议事日程。中共江苏省委以及许多地委、县委的负责同志1959年曾多次到农村访问农业中学，帮助总结经验，提高教学质量。同时，继续调配了一批骨干到农业中学担任领导工作；选派了一批有生产经验的老农，到农业中学担任技术指导。全国许多地区有关教育部门、师范院校还通过建立农业中学教师辅导团、进修学校、短期轮训班等方式，系统地培养农业中学教师。江苏省去年暑假前专门建立了农业中学教师进修学校，抽调一千多名农业中学教师进行训练，使他们在暑假后担任了农业中学二年级课程的教学工作。河北省石家庄地区教育部门适应农业技术改造的需要，在去年10月前后和有关部门协作训练了二百一十名农业技术教师。最近，这个省又在为农业中学训练四百名教农业机械课的教师。
