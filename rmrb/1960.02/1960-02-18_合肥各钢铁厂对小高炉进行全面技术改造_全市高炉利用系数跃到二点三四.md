Hefei Steel Plants Carry Out Comprehensive Technical Transformation of Small Blast Furnaces: Citywide Blast Furnace Utilization Coefficient Jumps to 2.34

(Reported by this newspaper) Steel plants in the Hefei area of Anhui Province have carried out "Sixteen Doubles" technical transformation in the five major systems of small blast furnaces—air supply, gas, charging, cooling, and furnace structure—comprehensively and systematically transforming the small blast furnaces and greatly enhancing their production potential. The city’s average blast furnace utilization coefficient in January increased from 1.93 in December of last year to 2.34, the qualified rate of pig iron increased from 97% to 97.42%, and the average coke ratio decreased to 0.95.

The "Sixteen Doubles" technical transformation of the five major systems of small blast furnaces—air supply, gas, charging, cooling, and furnace structure—was first launched by the Zhengfa Steel Plant No. 1 after fully implementing five technical transformations in the air supply system (enlarging hot blast stove pipelines, thickening cold and hot air pipes and surrounding pipes, changing spectacle valves to regulating valves, changing T-shaped cold air pipes to A-shaped, and changing small tuyeres to large or multiple tuyeres), according to the smelting policy of high intensity and high load, and the operational requirements of large air volume, high temperature, and small particle size. This involves gradually transforming the original single items of the sixteen blast furnace equipment into double items on the basis of the existing equipment. That is, a small blast furnace implements double rows of tuyeres, double cold and hot air pipelines, parallel double hot blast stoves, series double hot blast stoves, and parallel double blowers in the air supply system; double rising pipes, double downcomer pipes, double relief valves, double dust collectors, and double flues in the gas system; double inclined bridges, double charging cars, double hoppers, and double bells in the charging system; double cooling water pipes in the cooling system; and double iron notches in the furnace structure.

The "Sixteen Doubles" technical transformation has greatly improved the production level of small blast furnaces. First, it further realized the potential of the blast furnace equipment. After the double technical transformation of small blast furnaces, the air volume entering the furnace is no longer restricted by the pipelines, solving the problem that one pipeline cannot meet the needs of a large air volume to the maximum extent. The air volume per minute of a 13-cubic-meter blast furnace has increased from more than six times the blast furnace volume in the past to more than nine times. The wind temperature of the hot blast stove has also increased from more than 500 degrees to 700 degrees after parallel and series connections. Second, high production, high quality, and low consumption have been achieved. After the city's small blast furnaces carried out the five technical transformations of the air supply system and the "Sixteen Doubles" technical transformation of the five major systems, the pig iron production level has been raised to a new stage. For example, the average utilization coefficient of No. 12 blast furnace of Zhengfa Steel Plant No. 1 increased from 4.04 in December of last year to 4.29 in January; the average utilization coefficients of No. 12 and No. 3 blast furnaces of Caimao Steel Plant reached 4.286 and 4.124 respectively in January; and the highest daily output of pig iron from the four 13-cubic-meter blast furnaces No. 1, No. 15, No. 28, and No. 46 of the Provincial Party Committee Steel Plant all exceeded the 100-ton mark, with utilization coefficients reaching 7 to 8.28 respectively. The average coke ratio of these blast furnaces has been reduced to below 0.8, and the qualified rate of pig iron is 100%.

    合肥各钢铁厂对小高炉进行全面技术改造
    全市高炉利用系数跃到二点三四
    本报讯　安徽省合肥地区各钢铁厂在小高炉送风、煤气、上料、冷却和炉体结构五大系统开展“十六双”技术改造，全面系统地改造小高炉，大大发挥了小高炉的生产潜力。全市1月份高炉的平均利用系数已由去年12月份的一点九三提高到二点三四，生铁合格率由97％提高到97．42％，平均焦比降到零点九五。
    小高炉送风、煤气、上料、冷却和炉体结构五大系统的“十六双”技术改造，是政法钢铁一厂全面推行送风系统五项技术改造（加大热风炉管道，加粗冷热风管和围管，改眼镜阀为调节阀，改丁字形冷风管为人字形，改小风口为大风口或多风口。）以后，根据高强度、高负荷的冶炼方针和大风、高温、小粒度的操作要求，首先开展起来的。这是在原有设备的基础上，逐步把十六项高炉设备由原来的单项改造成双项。即一座小高炉实行送风系统的双排风眼、双冷热风管道、双热风炉并联、双热风炉串联、双鼓风机并联；煤气系统的双上升管、双下降管、双放散阀、双除尘器、双烟道；上料系统的双斜桥、双料车、双料斗、双料钟；冷却系统的双冷却水管和炉体结构的双铁口。
    “十六双”技术改造大大提高了小高炉的生产水平。首先是进一步发挥了高炉设备的潜力。小高炉经过成双的技术改造，入炉风量不受管道的限制，解决了一条管道不能最大限度满足大风需要的问题，一座十三立方米高炉每分钟的风量，由过去超过高炉容积六倍以上提高到九倍以上。热风炉经过并联和串联，风温也由五百多度提高到七百度。其次是实现了高产优质低消耗。全市小高炉进行送风系统的五项技术改造和五大系统的“十六双”技术改造以后，生铁生产水平提高到了一个新的阶段。如政法钢铁一厂十二号高炉1月份平均利用系数由去年12月份的四点零四提高到四点二九；财贸钢铁厂的十二号和三号高炉1月份平均利用系数分别达到四点二八六和四点一二四；省委机关钢铁厂的一号、十五号、二十八号和四十六号四座十三立方米高炉生铁最高日产量都突破百吨大关，利用系数分别达到七到八点二八。这些高炉的平均焦比都降低到零点八以下，生铁合格率为百分之百。
