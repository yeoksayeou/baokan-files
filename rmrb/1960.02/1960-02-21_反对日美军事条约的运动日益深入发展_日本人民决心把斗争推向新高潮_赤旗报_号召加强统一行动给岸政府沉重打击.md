The movement of the Japanese people to prevent the ratification of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is developing vigorously and more deeply into the grassroots. People from all walks of life are in high spirits, determined to push the struggle to a new climax to greet the twelfth national unified action day.

According to the National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," about 1,000 joint struggle organizations at all levels have been established throughout Japan, and grassroots joint struggle organizations in districts, towns, and villages are being established one after another. These organizations have formulated specific plans and are resolutely carrying out the struggle to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty." The Nagano Prefecture Joint Struggle Conference began its first action month against the new "Security Treaty" on February 15, holding rallies in various cities, towns, and villages, while launching a campaign to collect 600,000 signatures to urge local governments at all levels to pass resolutions against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

The Osaka Joint Struggle Conference to Prevent the Revision of the "Security Treaty" decided to mobilize Osaka workers to strike on the twelfth national unified action day—February 25, and to hold a central convention and demonstrations on the same day. The conference also decided to hold a grand march against the new "Security Treaty" throughout Osaka Prefecture from early March to the end of March.

Trade union organizations in various places will take resolute action to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty." The joint organization of Hyogo Prefecture trade unions for the spring struggle is preparing to hold simultaneous general mobilization rallies in various parts of the prefecture on the day of the twelfth national unified action, and to coordinate with the Kagoshima-Tokyo grand march demanding the return of Okinawa to Japan by the United States and opposing Japanese nuclear armament. A grand march to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" and to protect livelihoods and rights will be held in the prefecture.

The 21st Central Committee meeting of the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union issued a declaration on the 19th, stating that the union will launch a strong struggle to prevent the Diet from ratifying the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The declaration said that past struggles have proven that no matter what suppression is encountered, the unity of the workers will bring final victory.

The National Federation of Farmers' Associations has decided to mobilize farmers' organizations throughout the country to launch a struggle to prevent the criticism of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

The actions of people in the cultural and educational circles are also more active. The Osaka Teachers' Union held an extraordinary meeting on the 18th and decided to mobilize local primary and secondary school teachers to participate in the twelfth national unified action on the 25th to oppose the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." On that day, 30% of the teachers in elementary schools, junior high schools, and high schools in Osaka City and 20% of the teachers in elementary schools in the suburbs of Osaka City will stop teaching from noon, gather in Oogimachi Park in Osaka City, and hold a rally against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: The Japanese Communist Party's organ newspaper, "Akahata," published an editorial on the 19th, calling on all JCP members and the working class to stand at the forefront of the people and fight for the victory of the twelfth national unified action.

The editorial said that as the Diet is about to begin deliberating the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the struggle of the Japanese working class and the people to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" has set off an unprecedented upsurge, and at the same time, spring struggles against unemployment and poverty will be launched in various places. The Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party are playing various tricks and taking an offensive attitude in an attempt to undermine the unity and solidarity of the people. The editorial emphasized the importance of launching the twelfth national unified action victoriously under such circumstances.

The editorial said that first of all, it is necessary to further strengthen the spring struggle of the working class and the struggle of people from all walks of life against the 1960 national budget draft proposed by the Liberal Democratic Party, and to combine these struggles with the struggle to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

The editorial pointed out that while respecting the independence of the struggles of various groups, it is necessary to strengthen unified action and the united front through mutual support and cooperation, further strengthen the unity of workers with people from other walks of life, and establish the leading position of the working class. Only in this way can the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party be dealt a heavy blow.

The editorial pointed out that it is necessary to concentrate the demands of the masses in all regions and all posts, strengthen the struggle, strengthen joint action, and expand the united front. In this process, develop the cooperation between the Communist Party and the Socialist Party and double the number of joint struggle organizations compared to the present.

The editorial emphasized that it is necessary to ensure the victory of the signature campaign against the new "Security Treaty." This signature campaign is to show the Japanese people's fighting will against U.S. imperialism, the Kishi Nobusuke government, and the Liberal Democratic Party, and will become a huge pressure on the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.

    反对日美军事条约的运动日益深入发展
    日本人民决心把斗争推向新高潮
    “赤旗报”号召加强统一行动给岸政府沉重打击
    本报综合报道　日本人民阻止批准日美“安全条约”的斗争正在日益蓬勃地、更加深入基层地发展。各阶层人民斗志昂扬，决心把斗争推向新的高潮，来迎接第十二次全国统一行动日。
    据阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议宣布，日本全国已经成立了约一千个各级共同斗争组织，区、镇和村的基层共同斗争组织正陆续成立起来。这些组织纷纷决定具体计划，坚决地开展阻止批准新“安全条约”的斗争。长野县共同斗争会议从2月15日开始，展开了第一次反对新“安全条约”的行动月，分别在各市、镇、村举行集会，同时展开征集六十万人签名的运动，促使各级地方政府通过反对批准新“安全条约”的决议。
    大阪的阻止修改“安全条约”共同斗争会议决定在第十二次全国统一行动日——2月25日动员大阪的工人举行罢工，并且在当天举行中央大会和示威游行。会议还决定从3月上旬到3月底在大阪府境内举行反对新“安全条约”的大游行。
    各地工会组织将以坚决的行动阻止批准新“安全条约”。兵库县工会春季斗争的联合组织准备在第十二次全国统一行动的当天，在县内各地同时举行总奋起大会，并且配合要求美国把冲绳归还给日本和反对日本核武装的鹿儿岛—东京大游行，在县内举行阻止批准新“安全条约”，维护生活与权利的大游行。
    日本全递信从业员工会第二十一次中央委员会会议19日发表宣言说，工会要展开强有力的斗争，来阻止国会批准新日美“安全条约”。宣言说，过去的斗争经验证明，不管遭到任何镇压，工人的团结会带来最后的胜利。
    全日本农民协会联合会已经决定发动全国各地的农民组织展开阻止批判日美军事同盟条约的斗争。
    文化教育界人士的行动也更加活跃。大阪教职员工会18日召开临时大会，决定在25日动员当地中小学校教员参加第十二次全国统一行动，反对新日美“安全条约”。那一天，大阪市内的小学、初中和高中的30％的教员以及大阪市郊区小学校的20％的教员将从中午起停止授课，在大阪市扇町公园集合，举行反对新日美“安全条约”的大会。
    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”19日发表社论，号召日共全体党员和工人阶级站在人民的前头，为争取第十二次全国统一行动的胜利而奋斗。
    社论说，当国会即将开始审议新日美“安全条约”的时候，日本工人阶级和人民阻止批准新“安全条约”的斗争掀起了前所未有的高潮，与此同时各地将展开反对失业和贫困的春季斗争。岸信介内阁和自由民主党正在玩弄种种手段，采取进攻态度，企图破坏人民的团结和统一。社论强调指出在这种情况下，争取胜利展开第十二次全国统一行动的重要性。
    社论说，首先要进一步加强工人阶级的春季斗争和各阶层人民反对自由民主党提出的1960年度国家预算草案的斗争，使这些斗争同阻止批准新“安全条约”的斗争结合起来。
    社论指出，在尊重各阶层团体斗争的独立性的同时，必须通过互相支援和合作来加强统一行动和统一战线，进一步加强工人同其他各阶层人民的团结，确立工人阶级的领导地位。这样才能给予岸信介内阁和自由民主党以沉重的打击。
    社论指出，必须在所有地区和一切岗位集中群众的要求，加强展开斗争，加强共同行动和扩大统一战线。在这个过程中发展共产党和社会党的合作，使共同斗争组织比现在增加一倍。
    社论强调指出，必须使征集反对新“安全条约”的签名运动获得胜利。这种签名运动是表明日本人民对美帝国主义和岸信介政府以及自由民主党的斗争意志，并将成为对美日反动派的巨大压力。
