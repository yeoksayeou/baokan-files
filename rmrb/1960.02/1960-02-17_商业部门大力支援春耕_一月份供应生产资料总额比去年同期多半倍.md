Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch: Commercial departments in various regions, based on the new situation of sustained leaps forward in agricultural production and the large-scale unfolding of agricultural technological transformation this year, are vigorously strengthening the supply of agricultural production materials to support spring plowing production.

To meet the urgent needs of agricultural technological transformation, the supply of farmland irrigation and drainage machinery, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and semi-mechanized farm implements to rural areas through commercial departments will increase significantly this year. The production of these commodities was arranged as early as the fourth quarter of last year, so from the beginning of this year, the supply of agricultural production materials has shown the characteristics of being early, large in quantity, diverse in variety, and good in quality. In January, the total value of agricultural production materials supplied nationwide increased by 55.6% compared with the same period last year, with chemical fertilizers increasing by 55% and power-driven irrigation and drainage machinery increasing by 47%. The amount of steel allocated by the state to various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions for the production of farm tools this year has also increased significantly compared to last year. At present, commercial departments in various regions are collaborating with industrial departments to use this batch of steel to rush-produce semi-mechanized farm tools and improved farm tools, so that the variety and quantity of agricultural machinery supplied to rural areas will increase.

In order to ensure that the supplied mechanized and semi-mechanized farm tools can smoothly play a role in agricultural production, industrial departments and commercial departments have paid special attention to the complete equipment and spare parts supply work. In addition, commercial departments in various regions have generally strengthened the training of technicians to enable them to play a greater role in agricultural technological transformation. According to statistics from thirteen provinces including Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Guangdong, Hubei, and Gansu, more than 2,100 technicians have already been trained by technical training classes organized by provincial-level commercial departments.

While doing a good job in supplying agricultural production materials distributed under the state plan, commercial departments in various regions are also vigorously collaborating with relevant departments to organize people's communes to produce agricultural production materials according to the principle of "local materials, local production, local supply" to meet local needs. The commercial departments of Henan, Shanxi, and Fujian provinces have currently organized local industries to produce more than 65 million pieces of various small farm tools, accounting for 76% of the total amount of small farm tools needed in the three provinces during the spring and summer seasons. Commercial departments in many regions have also helped county-run or commune-run industries rush-produce new-style farm tools or improved farm tools by providing samples and supplying drawings, improving technical level and product quality.

    商业部门大力支援春耕
    一月份供应生产资料总额比去年同期多半倍
    据新华社16日讯　各地商业部门根据今年农业生产将持续跃进和农业技术改造大规模展开的新形势，正在大力加强农业生产资料的供应工作，支援春耕生产。
    适应农业技术改造的迫切需要，今年国家通过商业部门供应农村的农田排灌机械、化肥、农药和半机械化农具，都将比去年有很大增长。这些商品的生产早在去年第四季度即已安排好，因此今年一开始，农业生产资料的供应就显示出时间早、数量大、品种多、质量好的特点。1月份全国农业生产资料的供应总额比去年同期增加了55．6％，其中化学肥料增长55％，动力排灌机械增长47％。今年国家调拨给各省、市、自治区生产农具的钢材，也比去年增加很多。目前，各地商业部门正在协同工业部门利用这批钢材赶制半机械化农具和改良农具，使供应农村的农业机具品种、数量都增加。
    为了保证供应的机械化、半机械化农具能够顺利地在农业生产中发挥作用，工业部门和商业部门特别注意到设备成套和配件供应工作。此外，各地商业部门还普遍加强了技术员的培养训练工作，使他们在为农业技术改造中发挥更大的作用。据河南、陕西、山西、广东、湖北、甘肃等十三个省统计，由省级商业部门举办的技术训练班训练的技术人员已有二千一百多人。
    在做好国家计划分配的农业生产资料供应工作的同时，各地商业部门还大力协同有关部门，组织人民公社在“就地取材、就地生产、就地供应”的原则下，生产农业生产资料，满足本地的需要。河南、山西、福建三省商业部门目前已组织地方工业生产各种小农具六千五百多万件，相当三省春夏两季所需小农具总量的76％。许多地区的商业部门还从提供样品，供给图纸等方面帮助县办或社办工业赶制新式农具或改良农具，提高技术水平和产品质量。
