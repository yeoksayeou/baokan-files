    Unmanned Workshop Section
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Shanghai No. 1 Pharmaceutical Factory recently created an "unmanned workshop section" – the acetonitrile section. For the chemical industry, including dyes, plastics, and various gas-phase reactions and chemical syntheses in the basic chemical industry, it has created a good start in how to implement "unmanned management" using indigenous and foreign methods combined.
    The acetonitrile section is a part of the Vitamin B1 workshop in this factory, and it used to have six workers. During production, workers had to add and discharge materials, repair leaking equipment, and control the flow rate of raw materials, without being able to leave their posts for a moment. This section had three sets of equipment, but because the workers were too busy, the three sets of equipment were rarely used simultaneously.
    During the technical innovation campaign, worker Yin Zuobin proposed implementing "automation." After the leadership and the broad masses of workers worked hard and cleverly for twenty-five days, the "unmanned workshop section" was finally completely transformed not long ago. Now, the entire production process of this section is automatically controlled by instruments. Workers only need to add materials once every three days. All three sets of equipment can also be used simultaneously. The production efficiency of the "unmanned workshop section" has doubled compared to the original manual operation.

    无人工段
    本报讯　上海第一制药厂最近出现了一个“无人工段”——乙腈工段为化学工业中的染料、塑料以及基本化学工业中的各种气相反应和化学合成，如何用土洋结合的方法实行“无人管理”，创造了良好的开端。
    乙腈工段是这个厂制造维生素乙（1）车间中的一个工段，过去有六个人。工人在生产的时候，一边要加料和放料，一边还要修理漏气设备和控制原料流动速度，一刻也不能离开生产岗位。这个工段有三套设备，但因工人忙不过来，三套设备很少同时生产。
    在技术革新运动中，工人殷作斌提出了实行“自动化”的建议。经过领导人员和广大职工二十五天的苦干巧干，“无人工段”终于在不久以前全部改造完成。现在，这个工段的全部生产过程都由仪表自动控制。工人只需隔三天加一次料。三套设备也可以同时用了。“无人工段”的生产效率比原来手工操作提高一倍。
