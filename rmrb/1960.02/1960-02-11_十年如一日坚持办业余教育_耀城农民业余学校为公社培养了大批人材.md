Persisting in Running Spare-Time Education for a Decade
Yaocheng Farmers' Spare-Time School Cultivates a Large Number of Talents for the Commune
Main experiences: Educating students with the spirit of continuous revolution, enabling them to persist in learning for a long time; at the same time, according to the development of the situation, gradually increasing spare-time higher primary school classes, junior high school classes, and senior high school classes to ensure the continuous improvement of students' cultural and technical level. Teaching is closely integrated with production, and teaching materials are supplemented as needed. Pay attention to improving teaching and improving teaching quality to continuously consolidate the school. Party branch secretaries and branch members take the lead in learning and set an example for the masses.

    This newspaper reports that under the leadership of the Party, the Yaocheng Liberation Production Team Farmers' Spare-Time School (hereinafter referred to as Yaocheng Farmers' Spare-Time School) of the Yaocheng People's Commune in Tongchuan City, Shaanxi Province, has persisted in running spare-time education for ten years. Many students who have studied here have become agricultural technicians of the commune and created high-yield records. Many students have also learned how to operate tractors, electric motors, electric grinders, diesel engines, etc.
    The teaching of this school is closely centered on the local production reality. For example, with vegetable production as the main focus, the school often invites experienced vegetable farmers and technical cadres from the commune's vegetable experiment station to give lectures to the students. In the teaching process, attention is also paid to combining classroom explanations with practical application. For example, when wheat is affected by stripe rust, the teacher goes to the field to explain the lesson of "prevention and control of diseases and insect pests" to the students, so that the students can identify diseased wheat leaves and master the prevention and control methods. The teaching materials of this school are also frequently supplemented according to the needs of the situation. For example, new content such as "Advancing under the Red Flag of the General Line" and "The People's Commune is Good" has been added to the political class. New teaching materials related to diesel engines, electric motors, tractors, ammonium sulfate, nitrogen fertilizer, electric grinders, double-wheel double-share plows, etc. have been added to the agricultural common sense class. In order to deepen the learning effect, the school often organizes students to visit the commune's tractor station, agricultural machinery repair shop, etc.; it has also signed a borrowing contract with the Tongchuan City Cultural Center, so that students have borrowed more than 3,000 books. Many students have read books such as "Michurin" and "Rural Electrification." They also hold a reading symposium once a week to discuss their reading experiences. The students can learn knowledge in the spare-time school, so they are very enthusiastic about learning.
    Yaocheng Farmers' Spare-Time School has persisted in consolidating and improving. After the establishment of the school, the Yaocheng Liberation Production Team Party Branch used the spirit of continuous revolution to educate students to persist in learning. For example, some de-illiterate students were satisfied with the status quo, believing that "peasants only need to know a few words." The Party Branch immediately explained to the students the principle that "socialism is paradise, and you cannot go to it without culture," calling on de-illiterate students to "go to a higher level" and continue to climb the peak of culture and science. This timely overcame the wrong ideas among the students. In order to consolidate the achievements of literacy, they adopted the method of "eliminating one, consolidating one" to prevent the phenomenon of regression and relapse. As soon as a student reaches the literacy standard, they are immediately accepted and issued a literacy graduation certificate, and then enrolled in a spare-time higher primary school class to continue their studies. For students who have not yet reached the literacy standard, affirm their academic achievements, and explain to them that the main reason for their late literacy is that they have not studied regularly, encouraging them to continue their efforts, and the teacher will strengthen individual tutoring. In order to meet the requirements of de-illiterate students to continue their studies, this school has gradually opened spare-time higher primary school classes, spare-time junior high school classes, and spare-time senior high school classes on the basis of literacy classes.
    In order to keep spare-time education going, the secretary of the Party branch serves as the director of the school affairs committee, and all members of the branch participate in learning. Secretary Hou Zhiyi insisted on going to school to study even when he was ill. The students were moved when they saw it and said that they would never easily miss class. At the same time, the Party branch regularly discusses school work, stipulates that general meetings must not occupy the school's classrooms, general work must not occupy study time, and production and study time are arranged uniformly according to the agricultural season. During the Great Leap Forward in steelmaking in 1958, the Party branch proposed: Give way without stopping. They sent teachers to accompany the students to the iron smelting furnace, and insisted on teaching while smelting iron. This school pays special attention to improving teaching and improving teaching quality, so that the school is continuously consolidated. When the spare-time higher primary school class was first established, some people pursued formality and imitated the curriculum setting of ordinary primary schools. The students felt that too many courses were offered and there were too few teaching materials related to production. After the Party branch discovered this, it immediately organized teachers and students to repeatedly discuss and study, so that everyone unanimously realized that spare-time education must be combined with production. The school then improved teaching and opened three courses: politics, culture, and technology. The teachers also collected agricultural proverbs, high-yield experiences, good deeds, etc. to compile teaching materials.
    One of the reasons why Yaocheng Farmers' Spare-Time School can persist for a long time and get better and better is that it relies on the masses to continuously overcome difficulties. When it was first established, the school had nothing. The Party branch mobilized the masses to support it on the one hand, and educated teachers and students to rely on their own efforts on the other. When the masses heard about running their own school, they enthusiastically donated this and that. Without classrooms, the masses donated materials and contributed labor, and built two classrooms in three days. Lacking teachers, many people stepped forward to take on teaching. When there were not enough tables and chairs, the masses automatically lent the school Eight Immortals tables, bed boards, and wind screens. Teachers and students all adhered to the spirit of "running schools diligently and thriftily," and made chalk, blackboards, etc. by themselves. In the past ten years, this school has not spent a penny of government money.

    十年如一日坚持办业余教育
    耀城农民业余学校为公社培养了大批人材
    主要经验：用不断革命的精神教育学员，使他们长期坚持学习；同时根据形势的发展，逐步增设业余高小班、初中班和高中班，保证了学员的文化技术水平持续提高。教学紧密结合生产，并根据需要补充教材。注意改进教学，提高教学质量，使学校不断巩固。党支部书记和支部委员带头学习，为群众树立榜样。
    本报讯　陕西省铜川市耀城人民公社耀城解放生产队农民业余学校（以下简称耀城农民业余学校）在党的领导下，十年如一日坚持举办业余教育。在这里学习过的不少学员，成了公社的农业技术员，创造了高产纪录。许多学员还学会了开拖拉机、电动机、电磨、柴油机等。
    这个学校的教学密切围绕当地的生产实际。如以蔬菜生产为主，学校就经常请有经验的菜农和公社蔬菜试验站的技术干部给学员讲课。在教学过程中，还注意把课堂讲解和实际运用结合起来。如小麦发生条锈病，教师就下田给学员讲解“防治病虫害”一课，使学员们都能识别发病麦叶，并掌握了防治的方法。这个学校的教材还经常根据形势需要加以补充。如在政治课中曾经增加了“高举总路线的红旗前进”、“人民公社好”等新内容。农业常识课曾经增加了有关柴油机、电动机、拖拉机、硫酸铵、氮肥、电磨、双轮双铧犁等新教材。为了加深学习效果，学校经常组织学员参观访问公社的拖拉机站、农具修配厂等；还和铜川市文化馆订立借阅合同，使学员先后借阅书三千多本次。许多学员都看了“米丘林”、“农村电气化”等书。他们每周还举行一次读书座谈会，座谈读书心得。学员们在业余学校能够学到知识，学习的劲头就很大。
    耀城农民业余学校是在不断地巩固、提高中坚持下来的。学校成立以后，耀城解放生产队党支部就用不断革命的精神，教育学员坚持学习。如有的脱盲学员满足现状，认为“庄稼汉识几个字就行了”。党支部立刻向学员讲清“社会主义是天堂，没有文化不能上”的道理，号召脱盲学员“更上一层楼”，继续攀登文化科学的高峰。这就及时克服了学员中的错误思想。为了巩固扫盲的成果，他们采取了“扫除一个，巩固一个”的办法，防止回生复盲现象。一有学员达到脱盲标准，立刻进行验收，发给扫盲毕业证书，随即编入业余高小班继续学习。对还没有达到脱盲标准的学员，肯定他们的学习成绩，并向他们说明迟脱盲的主要原因是没有经常学习，勉励他们继续努力，并由教师加强个别辅导。为满足脱盲学员继续学习的要求，这个学校在扫盲班的基础上，逐步开设了业余高小班、业余初中班和业余高中班。
    为使业余教育坚持下去，党支部书记担任校务委员会主任，支部委员都参加学习。书记侯志义有病还坚持到校学习。学员看了，感动不已，表示决不轻易缺课。同时，党支部定期讨论学校工作，规定一般会议不得占用学校的教室，一般工作不得占用学习时间，并根据农事季节，统一安排了生产和学习时间。1958年大炼钢铁时，党支部就提出：让路不停车。他们派教师随同学员到炼铁炉旁，边炼铁边坚持教学。这所学校特别注意改进教学，提高教学质量，使学校不断巩固。业余高小班刚成立时，有人追求形式，仿照普通小学课程设置，学员都感到课开得太多，而有关生产的教材太少。党支部发现后，立即组织师生反复讨论研究，使大家一致认识到：业余教育必须结合生产。学校随即改进教学，开设了政治、文化、技术三门课。教师们还收集农谚、丰产经验、好人好事等编写了教材。
    耀城农民业余学校能够长期坚持，越办越好，原因之一是依靠群众不断地克服了困难。初办时，学校一无所有。党支部一面发动群众支援，一面教育师生自力更生。群众一听说办自己的学校，都热情地捐这送那。没有教室，群众就捐料献工，三天修起了两间教室。缺少教师，不少人就挺身而出，担任教学。桌椅不够用，群众自动把八仙桌、床板、风屏等借给学校。师生们都本着“勤俭办学”的精神，自制粉笔、黑板等。十年来，这个学校没有花过政府一文钱。
