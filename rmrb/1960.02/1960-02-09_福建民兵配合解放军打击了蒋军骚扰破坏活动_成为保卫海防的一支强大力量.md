Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, February 8th: The Fujian militia, with its glorious fighting tradition, has played a significant role in cooperating with the People's Liberation Army in defending the coast over the past year, becoming a powerful force for coastal defense.

On the Fujian Province coastal defense line facing the Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched on Jinmen (Quemoy), Mazu (Matsu), and other islands, militiamen can be seen everywhere alongside PLA soldiers, watching the sea and monitoring the enemy. Regardless of wind and rain, or scorching sun, they persist in production while working with the soldiers to vigorously combat the harassment and sabotage activities of the Chiang Kai-shek troops. Over the past year, militiamen in various coastal areas have assisted the PLA in capturing several groups of Chiang Kai-shek's agents attempting to infiltrate the mainland by sea, and have repeatedly foiled the Chiang Kai-shek troops' conspiracies to capture our fishermen. On February 2, last year, the Mazu Island Chiang Kai-shek's "No. 63" gunboat sneaked into the Niushan fishing grounds off Pingtan Island, attempting to rob our fishing boats and capture our fishermen. The militia of Liushui in Pingtan County, while reporting the enemy situation to the PLA, fought bravely andResourcefully with the enemy, and finally cooperated with a naval unit to sink the enemy boat, capturing and killing 23 Chiang Kai-shek military intelligence officers, including Gao Jianwu, a major deputy station chief of the Mazu Second Working Station of the Intelligence Bureau. A Chiang Kai-shek agent attempting to sneak into the mainland from the sea under cover of darkness was spotted by the militia before reaching the shore. As soon as he set foot on the shore, the coastal defense soldiers and the militia surrounded him and captured him alive.

"Defending the coast while engaging in production and construction" is the fighting slogan of the militia in various coastal areas of Fujian. Over the past year, militiamen engaged in offshore production have fought the enemy when they came, and vigorously promoted production when the enemy left. On the morning of June 27 last year, the Mazu Chiang Kai-shek troops shelled fishing boats of Lianjiang County and dispatched gunboats to pursue and capture our fishermen. The militia, with the cooperation of our powerful artillery units, escorted the fishing boats smoothly to the fishing grounds. The fishermen said happily: "The PLA is our backing, the militia is our sharp sword, and no matter how crazy the enemy is, they cannot stop us from vigorously engaging in production." That day, the fishermen were particularly motivated to produce, and the fish catch increased by more than double the usual amount. On another day, two armed special agent boats of the Chiang Kai-shek troops attempted to sneak into the fishing grounds between the mainland and Mazu. The militia, who were fishing, immediately put the fishing grounds on alert and prepared for battle. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the enemy fled in panic, and the militia actively engaged in production again and challenged the fishing boats with the highest output.

The militia on the Fujian front played a backbone and shock force role in production and construction. During the severe typhoon and flood disasters in coastal areas last August and September, the militia became the main force in protecting people's lives and property, and in rushing to plant and harvest crops. The militia in Xiamen, Zhangzhou, and other places guarded dikes and prevented floods day and night during the typhoons, and risked their lives to rescue a large amount of property of the people's communes and commune members. After the typhoons, they immediately rushed to the fields to boost production. The Xiamen Qianpu militia team, which had made meritorious service in the artillery battle supporting the PLA in punishing the Jinmen Chiang Kai-shek troops in 1958, rushed to plant vegetables in ten days covering 36 mu more than the entire area before the disaster. A large number of front-line militiamen have received various awards for their great role in production and construction and coastal defense.

The political and military quality of the Fujian militia has greatly improved through various struggles over the past year. Many young militiamen have joined the Communist Youth League, and a number of outstanding militiamen have honorably joined the Communist Party. With the enthusiastic help of the PLA, the militia have actively used their spare time from production to practice martial arts, and their combat skills have also greatly improved.

### 福建民兵配合解放军打击了蒋军骚扰破坏活动  成为保卫海防的一支强大力量

    福建民兵配合解放军打击了蒋军骚扰破坏活动
    成为保卫海防的一支强大力量
    据新华社福建前线8日电　有光荣战斗传统的福建民兵，一年来在配合人民解放军保卫海防中，发挥了重大作用，成为一支强大的海防保卫力量。
    在福建省面对蒋军盘踞的金门、马祖等岛屿的海防线上，到处有同解放军战士一起了望海洋、监视敌人的民兵。他们不顾风雨吹打、烈日暴晒，一面坚持生产，一面和战士们一起有力地打击了蒋军的骚扰破坏活动。一年来，沿海各地民兵，曾经协助解放军捕获了数批企图从海上潜入大陆的蒋介石集团特务，并多次粉碎蒋军抓捕我渔民的阴谋。去年2月2日，马祖岛蒋军“六三”号炮艇窜至平潭岛牛山洋渔场，企图抢劫我渔船，抓捕我渔民。平潭县流水的民兵们，一面把敌情报告解放军，一面英勇、机智地同敌人战斗，终于配合海军某部，把这艘敌艇击沉，俘虏、打死蒋军情报局马祖第二工作站少校副站长高建武等二十三人。企图黑夜从海上窜入大陆的一名蒋军特务，未到海岸，就被民兵发觉，他刚踏上岸，海防战士和民兵就把他团团包围，活活捉住。
    “一面保卫海防，一面生产建设”，是福建沿海各地民兵的战斗口号。一年来，下海生产的民兵，当敌人来了就打敌人，敌人去了就大搞生产。去年6月27日早晨，马祖蒋军炮击我连江县渔船，并出动炮艇追捕我渔民，民兵们在我强大炮兵部队配合下，掩护渔船顺利驶向渔场。渔民们高兴地说：“解放军是靠山，民兵是利剑，敌人再疯狂，也阻挡不住我们大闹生产”。这一天，渔民生产劲头特别大，捕鱼量比往常增加一倍多。另一天，蒋军的两只武装特务船，企图窜入大陆与马祖之间的渔场，正在捕鱼的民兵，立即把渔场警戒起来，准备战斗。敌人见势不妙，仓皇逃去，民兵们又积极投入生产，并向产量最高的渔船挑战。
    福建前线民兵，在生产建设中发挥了骨干作用和突击作用。去年8、9月间，沿海地区连受特大风灾和水灾时，民兵成了保护人民生命财产、抢种抢收的主力。厦门、漳州等地的民兵，在台风期间日夜护堤防洪，冒生命危险抢救出人民公社和社员大批财产。台风过后，立即奔赴田间突击生产。在1958年支援解放军惩罚金门蒋军的炮战中，立了战功的厦门前埔民兵队，十天抢种的蔬菜比灾前全部面积还多三十六亩，大批前线民兵由于在生产建设和保卫海防中发挥了巨大作用，受到了各种奖励。
    福建的民兵队伍，一年来经过各种斗争的锻炼，政治和军事素质有了很大提高。许多青年民兵加入了共青团，一批优秀民兵光荣地参加了共产党。在解放军的热情帮助下，民兵们积极利用生产空隙时间练武，战斗本领也大大提高。
