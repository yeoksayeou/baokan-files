Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: The first spring plowing of the 1960s is approaching, and a climax has already formed in the broad rural spring plowing campaign. This year, the spring plowing preparations of the people's communes in various localities have been done earlier and better than in previous years. Currently, the vast areas of the north are busy accumulating and transporting fertilizer, carefully selecting fine seeds, and inspecting and repairing farm tools. The Yangtze River basin is busy preparing rice paddies, irrigating, and delivering fertilizer. Some counties and people's communes have already applied most of the fertilizer for spring sowing to the fields. In some areas of South China, early rice has already been sown and seedlings are being raised.

This year, Party committees and governments at all levels have grasped the work of preparing for spring plowing very early. Around the Spring Festival, provinces and regions such as Heilongjiang, Hubei, Hunan, and Guangxi successively issued calls to concentrate all forces on doing a good job in spring plowing production, and held a series of cadre meetings, model worker meetings, spring plowing broadcast rallies, spring plowing on-site meetings, and mass rallies to launch a mass movement of the whole party and the whole people to fully prepare for spring plowing. Now, provinces such as Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Jiangsu, Guizhou, and Hunan have successively begun mass spring plowing inspections and appraisals. A nationwide general inspection of spring plowing preparations is pushing the mass movement of preparing for spring plowing to a new climax.

"Everything for spring plowing" has become the central slogan for all activities in the rural areas of the country. All localities, departments, and people's communes are vigorously promoting the spirit of collaboration, concentrating their efforts on preparing for spring plowing and sowing. Hubei, Anhui, and other provinces have expanded rice planting this year, and there is a shortage of rice seeds. Hunan Province has promoted the spirit of "leaving the difficulties to ourselves and giving the convenience to others," transferring 50 million jin of fine seeds to support these areas. Changde Prefecture found that some of the seeds transferred out were of poor quality, and immediately selected another 5 million jin from their own fine seeds for transfer. Various departments of industry, commerce, education, and the military in Sichuan Province have carried out extensive collaboration to support spring plowing, with more than 1 million laborers alone. Many areas of this province have also launched a large-scale technical support to the countryside movement to promote the technical transformation of agriculture. The industrial departments of many provinces and autonomous regions have also established special agencies to support agricultural production. The industrial departments of Hunan Province have more than doubled their support to the countryside in the form of water pumps, chemical fertilizers, gypsum, chemical pesticides, etc., compared to the same period last year.

A series of preparations for spring plowing and sowing in various places this year have all implemented the principle of taking grain as the key link, making overall arrangements, and diversifying operations. After in-depth discussions by the communes and production teams, this year's production plan was formulated. Various localities have adopted measures to increase the summer planting area, reclaim wasteland, and plant scattered land along villages, canals, ponds, reservoirs, etc. to expand the sown area of ​​crops, especially the area of ​​grain crops. Since autumn planting last year, five provinces and regions, including Hubei, Anhui, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Yunnan, have reclaimed more than 30 million mu of wasteland. In addition to a portion of winter crops already planted in winter, a considerable portion will be planted with grains, feed, and cash crops this spring. While strengthening the preparation for grain production, Xuchang Prefecture in Henan Province has particularly strengthened the preparation for the production of tobacco, cotton, etc. More than 60,000 specialized teams for tobacco, cotton, etc. have been established throughout the region. 67% of the fields prepared for spring sowing have been deeply plowed, 30% have been winter irrigated, and some communes have begun to raise seedlings of tobacco, cotton, and sweet potatoes in greenhouses. More than 80% of the cotton fields in this province have been water-conserved, and the irrigated area has been expanded by a quarter compared to last year.

In the current spring plowing activities, some areas in the Northwest, North China, Southwest, and South China that are experiencing spring drought are making the fight against spring drought an important task. Provinces such as Shaanxi and Henan, which have large drought-affected areas, are actively carrying out spring irrigation and making full use of all water sources to vigorously store water, rush to dig wells, and rush to repair various water conservancy projects to ensure water for spring plowing. Areas that have not been affected by drought are also vigorously storing water to conserve soil moisture. The new and old water conservancy projects in Anhui Province have stored 6.5 billion cubic meters of water, which can ensure water for spring plowing and spring irrigation.

    一切为了春耕
    广大农村备耕运动推向新的高潮
    各地各部门各公社大兴协作之风
    新华社17日讯　六十年代的第一个春耕即将到来，广大农村的备耕运动已经形成了高潮。今年，各地人民公社的春耕准备工作比往年作得又早又好。目前，北方广大地区正在忙着积肥送肥、精选良种和检修农具。长江流域各地正忙着整理秧田，灌水送肥。有些县和人民公社已经把春播肥料大部分送下了田。华南部分地区的早稻已经播种育秧。
    今年各级党和政府对备耕工作都抓得很早。春节前后，黑龙江、湖北、湖南、广西等省区就先后发出了集中一切力量搞好春耕生产的号召，召开了一系列的干部会、劳模会、备耕广播大会、备耕现场会和万人誓师会，掀起了全党全民全面备耕的群众运动。现在，辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、河南、陕西、甘肃、江苏、贵州、湖南等省又先后开始了群众性的备耕大检查和大评比。一个全国性的春耕准备工作大检查，正在把备耕的群众运动推向新的高潮。
    “一切为了春耕”已成为全国农村当前全部活动的中心口号。各地、各部门、各人民公社都大兴协作之风，集中力量准备春耕播种。湖北、安徽等省今年扩大种稻，稻种不足，湖南省就发扬“把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人”的精神，调出了五千万斤良种支援这些地区。常德专区发现外调种子中有少数质量较差，立即从自用的良种中另选了五百万斤外调。四川省工、商、学、兵各部门开展大协作支援春耕，仅是支援的劳力就有一百多万人，这个省的许多地区还开展了声势浩大的技术下乡运动，促进农业的技术改造。许多省、自治区的工业部门还成立了专门支援农业生产的机构。湖南省的工业部门支援农村的抽水机、化肥、石膏、化学农药等都比去年同期增加了一倍多。
    各地今年春耕春播的一系列的准备工作，都贯彻了以粮为纲、全面安排、多种经营的方针。经过公社和生产队深入讨论，制订了今年的生产计划。各地今年都采取增加夏种面积，开垦荒地，广种村边、渠边、塘边、库边等“十边”零散地等办法，扩大农作物的播种面积，首先是扩大粮食作物的面积。湖北、安徽、青海、新疆、云南等五个省区去年秋种以来所开垦的荒地就有三千多万亩左右。除去冬已种一部分越冬作物外，今年春季将有相当大一部分播种粮食、饲料和经济作物。河南许昌地区在加强粮食生产备耕的同时，特别加强了烟、棉等生产的备耕工作。全区已建立烟、棉等专业队六万多个，准备春播的田地，有67％已进行了深翻，30％进行了冬灌，部分公社已开始在温室进行烟、棉、红薯的育苗。这个省80％以上的棉田已实现了水利化，灌溉面积比去年扩大了四分之一。
    在当前的备耕活动中，西北、华北、西南和华南一部分发生春旱的地区，都把抗御春旱做为一项重要工作。受旱面积较广的陕西、河南等省，正积极开展春浇春灌，并利用一切水源，大抓蓄水、突击打井以及抢修各项水利工程，保证春耕用水。没有受旱的地区也在大力蓄水保墒。安徽省的新旧水利工程已蓄了六十五亿立方米的水，能够保证春耕及春灌用水。
