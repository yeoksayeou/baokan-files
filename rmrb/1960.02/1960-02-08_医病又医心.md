    Curing the Illness and Healing the Heart
    Huang Wenxi
    Workers can continuously create new records, and medical workers should also learn from the workers! This is the ambitious goal of all comrades in the Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital in the Spring Festival's good start.
    Trying every possible means to care for patients, accelerating the testing of new technologies, and eradicating the root of medical accidents—these are considered well done—but not enough! They want to do even better.
    Thus, even more touching deeds have emerged. Head Nurse Li Huiwen, in order to rescue a newborn suffering from asphyxia, urgently sucked the meconium and mucus from the baby's mouth with her own mouth! This action exceeded the general concept of "treating the sick and saving lives"; it was the attitude of a biological mother towards her own child.
    They not only saved the lives of many patients but also conducted political education on the minds of many patients, helping them establish revolutionary optimism. A patient named Zeng suffered from severe asthma and considered it a terminal illness, feeling listless all day and very pessimistic. Under the doctor's patient education, he realized that his thinking was incorrect, rekindled the flame of life, increased his courage in life, and his heart was broadened. After a period of recuperation, he was completely cured. Upon discharge, he said with tears of excitement: "The Party can not only cure my illness but also heal my heart, helping me establish a revolutionary outlook on life. I see a bright future..."
    Doctors doing ideological education work is precisely the duty of red medical workers. As a red doctor, he will first think of communist morality. If sucking out the meconium becomes necessary to save a life, he will feel that he has such an obligation. Combining treatment with helping patients overcome unhealthy thoughts is also the undeniable responsibility of a red doctor.
    Serving the people wholeheartedly is the characteristic of our era. Mao Zedong's thought has illuminated the spiritual depths of every revolutionary, constantly erupting with bright and dazzling sparks. This great thought leads people into a colorful world, allowing them to see how many treasures are waiting for them to create, how many wonderful peaks are waiting for them to climb, and how many "extra" things should become their "duty"! This great thought prevents people from complacently lying in the golden granary, but instead drives them to create one great achievement after another, endlessly and eagerly...

    医病又医心
    黄文锡
    工人能不继创造新纪录，医务工作者也要向工人看齐！——这是上海第九人民医院全体同志在新春开门红中的雄心壮志。
    千方百计对病人进行护理，加速新技术的试验，灭绝医疗事故的根源，这总算做得好了——不够！他们还要做得更好。
    于是，更动人的事迹涌现了。护士长李惠文为了抢救窒息的新生儿，急切中竟用自己的嘴吸净了婴儿口中的胎粪和粘液！这一动作，超出了一般的“治病救人”的概念，这是亲生母对待亲生儿的态度。
    他们不但挽救了许多患者的生命，而且还对许多患者的思想进行了政治教育，帮他们建立了革命的乐观主义思想。有一个姓曾的病人，患了严重的哮喘病，自认为绝症，恹恹终日，很是悲观。在医生的耐心教育下，他认识到自己思想的不对头，重又燃烧起生命的火焰，增添了生活的勇气，心宽则体胖，经过一度调养，竟痊愈了。出院时，他含着激动的泪水说：“党不仅能治好我的病，而且能治好我的心，帮助我建立了革命的人生观，我看到了美好的未来……”
    医生做思想教育工作，这正是红色医务工作者的本分。作为一个红色医生，他就会首先想到共产主义道德精神，如果口吮胎粪，成为拯救一个生命所必需的时候，他便会让为自己有这样的义务。结合治疗对于病患者的不健康思想进行帮助，也是一个红色医生所义不容辞的责任。
    全心全意为人民服务，这是我们时代的特色。毛泽东的思想已照亮了每个革命者的精神深处，不断地爆发着光亮夺目的火花。这伟大的思想把人们引入五彩缤纷的世界，使人看见有多少宝藏，等待他去开创；有多少奇峰，等待他去攀登；有多少“额外”的事，应该变成他“本分”的事！这伟大的思想，使人们不是心安理得地躺在金黄的谷囤里睡觉，而是永无休止地、如饥如渴地去创造一次又一次的丰功伟绩……
