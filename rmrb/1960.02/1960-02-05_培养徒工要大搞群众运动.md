Cultivating Apprentices Requires a Mass Movement
The Industry Department of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    Cultivating apprentices and rapidly improving their technical level is an urgent task on Xi'an's industrial front. Xi'an is a new industrial city that was built during the First Five-Year Plan. The old industrial bases across the country have supplied Xi'an with a large number of skilled workers, and these workers are the backbone force on which Xi'an's industrial construction relies. However, in order to adapt to the needs of rapid development of production and construction, it is also necessary to actively cultivate new forces. The Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has always attached importance to the work of cultivating new workers. In just a few years, the young workers we have cultivated have accounted for 80% of the total number of workers, becoming an important force in production.

    Mainly Cultivate in Production
    In cultivating apprentices, Xi'an mainly adopted the method of cultivating them in production. Factories both produce products and cultivate people.
    If we simply wait for technical schools to train new workers, many machines will be idle for two or three years. By adopting the method of cultivating apprentices in production, apprentices who have only been in the factory for more than a year are already able to operate independently, and many have reached the level of graded workers. Last year, there were also 13,000 Red Banner pacesetters and "Five-Good Apprentices." Apprentices can also learn technical theory in production enterprises, and many factories have created successful methods for learning theory. At the same time, putting apprentices in actual production struggles and in the ranks of workers can better transform their thinking. As some veteran workers have concluded, this method "produces the most promising people." This is a mass line method, which fully meets the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical results.
    In terms of technical learning, many factories in Xi'an have organized rapid training. This combines technical learning with production activities and on-site teaching. First, the master does it and the apprentice watches, and then the apprentice operates under the guidance of the master. Various units have also carried out activities such as "one master, multiple apprentices," "older apprentice helps younger apprentice," and "thousands teach and ten thousand learn," so that new workers can get learning opportunities anytime, anywhere. A lathe apprentice can generally take on simple production tasks under the guidance of a master in about a month. In terms of technical theory learning, in addition to organizing spare-time political and technical schools, many units have vigorously promoted group-run schools and workshop-run schools, combining self-study with lectures, and theory with practice. Many masters teach both operation and theory. Many units also organize "Apprentice Production Days," "Report Performance Competitions," and "Apprentice Product Exhibitions" in stages to check the completion of learning plans and continuously promote the learning upsurge.
    Of course, we do not relax our leadership over technical schools. Since strengthening political and ideological education and implementing work-study programs, the teaching quality of technical schools has been rapidly improved.

    Implement the Mass Line in Work
    In order to adapt to the leap-forward speed of industrial development, it is necessary to implement the mass line in the work of cultivating apprentices. In the past year, factories in Xi'an have carried out a series of mass movements in cultivating apprentices. When apprentices first arrive at the factory, they focus on political and ideological education, and in light of the specific ideological situation of the apprentices and the assignment of work, they universally launch debates on "For whom are you working hard?" They organize veteran workers to give reports and hold discussions with new workers, using their own personal experiences in the two societies to conduct vivid and profound class education for new workers, and help them establish a proletarian outlook on life. Later, in ideological education and technical education, they also always adopt the method of mass movement.

    Relying on veteran workers to educate new workers and guide new workers to learn from veteran workers not only in technology but also in ideology is a mass line and class line method of educating apprentices. The ideology of the working class is clearly and concretely manifested in veteran workers. They have a high level of class consciousness, a firm stance, strong organization and discipline, rich production experience, and a strong labor viewpoint. In order to better educate new workers, we have carried out "three help" activities among veteran workers in the city: "Help with ideology, help with technology, and help with life." Some veteran workers even moved into the apprentice dormitory to live, comprehensively and kindly teaching apprentices in terms of ideology, life, learning, and work.

    Learn from Zhang Xingyun, Catch up with Zhang Xingyun
    The recently launched movement to learn from, catch up with, and surpass Zhang Xingyun was launched based on the new situation of Xi'an's industrial development. After a year of training, more than 90% of the apprentices who entered the factory in 1958 are already able to operate independently. However, their labor efficiency is low, there are many rejects, and the quality is poor, which seriously affects the improvement of the city's labor productivity. In the city's industrial enterprises from January to October 1959, the labor productivity of production workers (excluding apprentices) increased by 16% compared with the same period in 1958, but the total labor productivity including apprentices decreased by 6% compared with the same period in 1958. Therefore, rapidly improving the technical level of apprentices has become a key to achieving high output, high quality, and low cost in Xi'an's industrial production, and is an important part of Xi'an's overall technological innovation plan for 1960. Zhang Xingyun, a female apprentice at the Yellow River Machine Factory, has set a good example in this regard. Due to diligent study and hard work, she has rapidly improved her skills in a very short period of time and has reached the level of a third-grade or higher worker. She learns with an open mind and has the advanced idea that "disciples do not necessarily have to be inferior to their teachers," and strives to emulate the most outstanding master workers. Establishing such an apprentice pacesetter will be of great help to apprentices throughout the city. The movement to learn from Zhang Xingyun has set off an unprecedented new upsurge of actively delving into technology among apprentices. The total labor productivity of the city's industrial enterprises in November last year increased by 29% compared with October, and compared with the same period in 1958, it not only did not decrease, but increased by more than 23%. As long as we adhere to the policy of vigorously launching mass movements under the leadership of the Party in the work of cultivating apprentices, it is entirely foreseeable that the technical level of these apprentices will be improved more rapidly, and the level of industrial production in the city will leap to a new height.

    培养徒工要大搞群众运动
    中共西安市委工业部
    培养徒工，迅速提高徒工的技术水平，是西安市工业战线的当务之急。西安是在第一个五年计划期间才建设起来的新兴工业城市。全国老工业基地为西安输送了大量的技术工人，这些工人是西安工业建设所依靠的骨干力量。但是，为了适应生产建设迅速发展的需要，还必须积极培养新生力量。中共西安市委一直重视培养新工人的工作，几年功夫，我们培养出来的青年工人已经占到工人总数的80％，成为生产中的重要力量。
    主要在生产中培养
    西安市培养徒工，主要采取了在生产中培养的方法。工厂既生产产品，又培养人。
    如果单纯等待技工学校培养新工人，许多机器就会停歇两三年。采取在生产中培养的办法，入厂才一年多的徒工大都已经能够独立操作，有许多人达到了等级工人的水平。去年还出现了一万三千名红旗手和“五好徒工”。徒工在生产企业同样可以学到技术理论，许多工厂都创造出了学习理论的成功方法。同时，把徒工放在实际生产斗争中、放在工人队伍中来培养，可以更好地改造他们的思想。正如一些老工人所下的断语，这种方法“最出息人”。这是群众路线的方法，完全符合多快好省的要求。
    在技术学习方面，西安市许多工厂组织了快速培训。这就是把技术学习和生产活动结合起来，现场教学。先是师傅作，徒弟看，进一步是徒工在师傅指导下操作。各单位还开展了“一师多徒”、“师兄帮师弟”、“千人教万人学”等活动，使新工人随时随地都能得到学习机会。车工徒工一般在一个月左右，就可以在师傅指导下担负简单的生产任务。在技术理论学习方面，除组织业余政治技术学校外，许多单位大搞小组办学和车间办学，使自修和讲授相结合，理论和实际相结合。许多师傅都是既教操作也讲理论。不少单位还分阶段组织“徒工生产日”、“汇报表演赛”、“徒工产品展览”等，检查学习计划完成情况，不断推动学习热潮。
    当然，我们也不放松对技工学校的领导。自从加强政治思想教育和实行勤工俭学以来，技工学校的教学质量有了迅速的提高。
    工作中贯彻群众路线
    为了适应工业发展的跃进速度，就要在培养徒工工作中贯彻执行群众路线。过去一年，西安市各工厂在培养徒工方面开展了一系列的群众运动。徒工初到厂，就大抓政治思想教育，结合分配工作和徒工的具体思想情况，普遍开展“为谁辛苦为谁忙”的辩论。组织老工人作报告，同新工人座谈，用他们自己在两种社会中的亲身经历，对新工人进行生动深刻的阶级教育，帮助新工人树立无产阶级的人生观。以后，在思想教育、技术教育中，也始终采取群众运动的方式。
    依靠老工人教育新工人，引导新工人，不仅在技术上而且在思想上向老工人学习，这是教育徒工的一种群众路线和阶级路线的方法。工人阶级思想鲜明、具体地表现在老工人身上，他们阶级觉悟高，立场坚定，组织性和纪律性强，有丰富的生产经验和强烈的劳动观点。为了更好地教育新工人，我们在全市老工人当中开展了
  “帮思想、帮技术、帮生活”的“三帮”活动。有些老工人还搬进徒工宿舍去住，从思想、生活、学习和工作方面全面地亲切地教导徒工。
    学张兴云　赶张兴云
    最近开展的学、赶、超张兴云运动，是根据西安市工业发展的新情况开展的。经过一年培训，在1958年进厂的徒工90％以上已经能够独立操作。但是他们的劳动效率低，废品多，质量差，严重影响到全市劳动生产率的提高。全市工业企业在1959年1到10月份，生产工人的劳动生产率（不包括徒工在内）比1958年同期提高16％，但是包括徒工在内的全员劳动生产率却比1958年同期降低了6％。因此，迅速提高徒工的技术水平成了西安市工业生产实现高产优质低成本的一个关键，是西安市1960年整个技术革新规划中的一个重要部分。黄河机器厂的女徒工张兴云在这方面树立了良好的榜样。她由于勤学苦练，在很短的时间内迅速提高了技术，已经达到三级以上工人的水平。她虚心学习而又有“弟子不必不如师”的先进思想，努力向最优秀的老师傅看齐。树立这样一个徒工标兵，会对全市徒工有很大帮助。向张兴云学习的运动，在徒工中掀起了一个积极钻研技术的空前的新高潮。全市工业企业的全员劳动生产率，去年11月份就比10月份提高了29％，同1958年同期比较，不仅不低，反而提高了23％以上。只要我们在培养徒工的工作中，坚持在党的领导下大搞群众运动的方针，完全可以预计，这些徒工的技术水平将更迅速地提高，全市的工业生产水平将跃进到一个新的高度。
