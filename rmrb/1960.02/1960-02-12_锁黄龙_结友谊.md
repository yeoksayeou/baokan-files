    Locking the Yellow Dragon, Building Friendship
    By Our Correspondents Dai Feng and Cui Yongchang

    Under the leadership of the Party, the Chinese people have heroically issued the oath to control the Yellow River, allowing the Yellow River, which has always harmed the people, to benefit the people. The Sanmenxia Project is the first battle in the Yellow River campaign. In recent years, the Chinese construction army, fighting day and night at the Sanmenxia construction site, has advanced triumphantly with soaring enthusiasm, enabling the project to achieve rapid progress. In this victorious advancing ranks, there are also our closest brothers and friends from all over the Soviet Union—many Soviet comrades.

    The Second Design Department

    In the Leningrad Hydroelectric Design Institute, Comrade Grosky, the director of the Second Design Department, led us to the Second Design Department. As soon as we entered, a piece of red cloth hanging on the opposite wall caught our eyes. On the red cloth were written in white characters: "Long Live the Tenth Anniversary of the People's Republic of China." In the center of the opposite wall hung a large portrait of Chairman Mao. On another wall were pasted various sizes of Qi Baishi's famous paintings, landscape paintings, Sanmenxia construction paintings, Chinese calendars, and so on.

    In this room, thirty or so staff members were intently working at four rows of neat square tables and vertical drawing stands.

    "This is our Sanmenxia Department," Comrade Grosky interrupted our thoughts, speaking slowly: "We are working for the socialist construction of our Chinese brothers, day after day."

    Several years ago, the Leningrad Hydroelectric Design Institute received the task of helping China design the Sanmenxia Project. Comrade Yanovsky, the director of the institute, personally led the effort, selecting the most experienced design and technical personnel in the institute to organize this Second Design Department for the Sanmenxia Project to ensure the smooth progress of the Sanmenxia design work. Over the years, this department has designed thousands of drawings for the Sanmenxia Project alone.

    The Soviet comrades in the Second Design Department regarded the Sanmenxia design project as they would their own Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Station project, fully demonstrating the spirit of ownership and creativity. In addition to ensuring the use of the latest technology, they paid special attention to saving materials. For example, in the design of high dams and other structures, many staff members put forward rationalization proposals, resulting in a saving of nearly one-third of the total concrete pouring volume. For example, designer Gimidov and others improved the position of a gate in the design of the power station plant, saving more than 400 tons of steel. Such examples are countless.

    During the Great Leap Forward, the Sanmenxia Project repeatedly completed its original construction tasks ahead of schedule. As the project progressed rapidly, the design work was required to be greatly accelerated. In order to rush out the construction drawings, the comrades of the Second Design Department did not go home after work and did not rest on Sundays. They completed about thirty design drawings every day.

    "Such a design speed has never been seen before," Comrade Grosky said, his emotions particularly excited at this point, "Our comrades understand the great efforts of the Chinese people. Therefore, we are also working hard. We have sent out the required design drawings on schedule."

    The Difficulty of Turbines

    Everyone knows that our Yellow River's rushing Yellow River water is mixed with a large amount of sediment. Therefore, building a hydroelectric power station on the Yellow River not only requires that the spillway high dam and other projects be absolutely strong, but also requires that the powerful turbines be able to withstand the pressure of this Yellow River water and be durable. This is also an unprecedentedly complex problem in the history of manufacturing giant turbines. How to solve it?

    "The solution has been found." Kolesnikov, an engineer from the Turbine Design Office of the Leningrad Metal Plant, explained to us while spreading out a large cross-sectional design drawing of the Sanmenxia turbine on the table, "When we accepted the design of this Sanmenxia turbine project, we carefully considered the characteristics of the Yellow River. The starting point for the design requirements of giant turbines is: advanced technology, strong and powerful, and long service life. Therefore, there have been new improvements in the entire design. As for the extremely frictional water vortex rotating part, we decided to use high-quality No. 4 steel to replace the previous No. 3 steel for the first time. In this way, the problem is solved. Of course, the first replacement of steel on the turbine will cause some new difficulties in cutting and assembly. But we fully believe in the superb skills of the workers, and, more importantly, their sense of responsibility for the construction cause of brotherly China, the difficulties will be solved."

    The Leningrad Metal Plant is one of the oldest and leading factories in the Soviet machine manufacturing industry. The powerful steam turbines produced by this factory for thermal power plants are operating normally in our country's industrial bases such as Fushun, Taiyuan, Wuhan, Shanghai, and Beijing. However, such a huge order for turbines as the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station was received for the first time. During the design process, Soviet comrades tried their best to use the most advanced technology to maximize the effectiveness of the turbine under possible conditions. The design engineers of this factory studied with Chinese engineers and improved the power generation capacity of each generator set in the design process. Because the technical improvements were paid attention to in the turbine design, the designed Sanmenxia turbine can not only withstand the water pressure of the Yellow River, but also greatly extend the service life of the turbine.

    Making way for Sanmenxia's orders

    At the end of last year, the Ural Electrical Machinery Plant in Sverdlovsk accepted an urgent production task: to manufacture a large generator for the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station. For the Ural Electrical Machinery Plant, accepting such a new task had certain difficulties. The main difficulty was the extremely short manufacturing deadline. Under normal circumstances, it would take no less than two years from design to manufacture such a generator. But now the completion deadline is only six or seven months.

    In order to successfully complete this task and allow the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station to transmit electricity ahead of schedule, the Party Committee of the Ural Electrical Machinery Plant held a special meeting to complete the Sanmenxia order, and adopted specific measures to ensure the completion of the Sanmenxia order, requiring all workshops, party members, league members and workers to go all out. For example, the first article of the resolution wrote: "In view of the great significance of the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station transmitting electricity ahead of schedule to the national economy of the People's Republic of China, the Party Committee believes that it is necessary to supplement and adjust the manufacturing process so that the first generator will be built in June 1960 and shipped in July." At the same time, the trade union also made a corresponding resolution, requiring all workshops to launch production competitions. Under the call of the Party Committee, all the workers of the factory worked together and put forward the loud slogan: "Make way for Sanmenxia's orders, ensure the completion of the task on schedule, and deliver the generator to Chinese brothers as early as possible."

    Now, the competition to complete the Sanmenxia generator task ahead of schedule has swept all the workers in the factory. Many workshops and sections of the factory are hung with clear slogans: "Everything for Sanmenxia", "This group is completing the order of the People's Republic of China", and so on. For some groups with outstanding production achievements, the factory trade union also decided to award red flags and the title of "Sanmenxia Hydropower Station" as rewards.

    Klyuchov, a member of the Communist Youth League of the Ural Electrical Machinery Plant, said in an open letter to all young workers in the factory that our factory has won the greatest honor: to manufacture a generator with a generating capacity of 150,000 kilowatts for brotherly China. In order to ensure that the order is shipped on schedule, more than 20 members of the Communist Youth League from the process technology department have formed a "support team" to help each workshop complete the task. The Communist Youth League members of this factory also organized workshop wall newspapers, Sanmenxia generator production broadcasts, and organized production inspection teams to supervise the completion of production according to plan.

    锁黄龙　结友谊
    本报记者　戴枫　崔永昌
    我国人民在党的领导下，英勇地发出了根治黄河的誓言，让一向为害人民的黄水来为人民造福。三门峡工程是黄河战斗的第一阵，这几年，日夜奋战在三门峡工地上的我国建设大军，高歌猛进，干劲冲天，使工程取得了迅速的进展。在这支胜利进军的行列中，参加的还有远在苏联各地的我们最亲密的兄弟和朋友——许许多多的苏联同志。
    第二设计部
    在列宁格勒水电设计分院里，第二设计部主任格罗斯基同志把我们领到第二设计部来。一进门口，悬挂在对面墙上的一幅红布便映入了我们的眼帘。红布上面用白色大字写着：“中华人民共和国十周年万岁。”对面的墙正中，挂着一个大幅的毛主席像，另一面墙上贴有大小不一的齐白石名画，山水国画，三门峡兴工画，中国日历，等等。
    在这个房间里四排整齐的方桌前和立式绘图架前有三十来个工作人员聚精会神地紧张工作着。
    “这就是我们的三门峡部”。格罗斯基同志打断了我们的思路，缓慢地说着：“为新中国兄弟的社会主义建设，我们工作着，数年如一日。”
    数年前，列宁格勒水电设计分院接到了帮助我国设计三门峡工程的任务。分院院长雅诺夫斯基同志亲自领导，为保证三门峡设计工作的顺利进展，挑选了院里最有经验的设计技术干部，组织了这个三门峡工程第二设计部。多年来，这个部仅为三门峡工程设计的图纸就有上千张。
    第二设计部的苏联同志，把三门峡设计工程看成像他们的克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站工程一样，充分发挥了主人翁的创造精神。他们除了保证运用最新技术之外，特别注意了节省材料。如在高坝等设计中，许多工作人员提出合理化建议，结果使全部混凝土浇灌量将近节省了三分之一。又如设计员吉米多夫等人，在电站厂房设计中，改进了一个闸门的位置，节约的钢材达四百多吨。这样的事例是不胜枚举的。
    三门峡工程在大跃进中，一再提前完成原定的施工任务。工程进展迅速，要求设计工作大大加快。第二设计部的同志们，为了赶制施工图，下班后不回家，星期日也不休息。每天完成的设计图纸达三十张左右。
    “这样的设计速度是早先未有过的”，格罗斯基同志说到这里时他的情绪格外兴奋，“我们的同志都理解中国人民的巨大努力。所以，我们也同样努力，需要的设计图纸我们都按期送出了。”
    水轮机的难题
    谁都知道，我们的黄河那奔腾而下的黄水，夹杂着大量的泥沙。因此，在黄河上建设水力发电站，除了要求溢水高坝等工程绝对坚固之外，还要求功率强大的水轮机既要吃得住这股黄泥水的压力，又要牢固耐久。这也是制造巨型水轮机史上所未有过的复杂难题。怎样解决呢？
    “解决办法已经找到了。”列宁格勒金属工厂水轮机设计处工程师科列斯尼可夫一面在桌上摊开大幅的三门峡水轮机剖面设计图，一面向我们解释道：“我们接受设计这项三门峡水轮机工程时，周密地考虑到了黄河的特点。巨型的水轮机设计要求的出发点是：技术先进，牢固强大，使用期长。所以整个设计上有了新的改进。至于擦力极大的水涡轮回转部分，我们决定第一次用优质的四号钢来代替先前的三号钢。这样，难题就解决了。当然，水轮机上首次更换钢材，在切削和装配上会产生些新困难。但我们完全相信技术高超的工人的双手，而且，更重要的是他们那种对兄弟中国建设事业的责任心，困难会迎刃而解的”。
    列宁格勒金属工厂是苏联机器制造工业方面历史最悠久的数一数二的老厂。这个工厂生产的热电站功率强大的汽轮机已在我国抚顺、太原、武汉、上海、北京等工业基地上正常运转着。而像三门峡水电站那样巨大的水轮机订货，还是初次接受。在设计过程中，苏联同志尽量考虑用最先进的技术，使水轮机效能在可能条件下获得充分发挥。这个厂的设计工程师们，与中国工程人员一起研究，在设计过程中，改进了原先每台发电机组的发电能力。由于水轮机设计中注意了技术改进，因此，设计成的三门峡水轮机不仅可以抵住黄河的水压，而且，可以使水轮机使用期大大延长。
    为三门峡的订货让路
    去年年底，斯维德洛夫城乌拉尔电机制造厂接受了一项紧要生产任务：为三门峡水电站制造一台大型发电机。对于乌拉尔电机制造厂说来，接受这样的新任务有着一定的困难，主要的难处是制造限期极短。根据平常一般情况，从设计到制造成这样的发电机，非两年不行。而现在完工期限只有六七个月。
    为了顺利完成这项任务，使三门峡水电站提前送电，乌拉尔电机制造厂党委召开了完成三门峡订货的专门会议，通过了保证完成三门峡订货的具体办法，要求各车间、各工段党团员职工们全力以赴。如决议的第一条中就写道：“鉴于三门峡水电站提前送电对于中华人民共和国国民经济具有着巨大的意义，厂党委认为必须补充调整制造工序，使第一台发电机1960年6月建成，7月启运”。同时，工会也相应地作出了决议，要求各车间展开生产竞赛。全厂职工们在党委号召下，齐心协力提出了响亮的口号：“为三门峡的订货让路，保证按期完成任务，提早把发电机送交给中国兄弟”。
    现在，为提前完成三门峡发电机任务的竞赛已席卷全厂职工。工厂的许多车间、工段里到处挂着鲜明的标语：“一切为了三门峡”，“这个小组完成着中华人民共和国订货”等等。有些生产成绩显著的小组，工厂工会还决定授予红旗、“三门峡水电站”称号，以资奖励。
    乌拉尔电机制造厂的共青团员克卢乔夫在写给全厂青年工人的公开信中说，我们工厂获得了最大的荣幸：为兄弟中国制造发电能力达十五万瓩的发电机。我们为了保证订货按期启运，工艺技术处的二十多名共青团员成立了“支援队”到各车间帮助完成任务。这个厂的共青团员们还组织了车间墙报、三门峡发电机生产广播，组织了生产检查队，监督生产按计划完成的情况。
