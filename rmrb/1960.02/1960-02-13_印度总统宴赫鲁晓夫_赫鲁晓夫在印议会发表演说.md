Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, February 11th: Indian President Prasad hosted a state banquet on the evening of the 11th to entertain Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev and his entourage.

Indian Prime Minister Nehru, Vice President Radhakrishnan, government ministers, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to India attended the banquet.

At the banquet, Prasad praised Khrushchev's significant contributions to easing world tensions.

In his reply, Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union spares no effort in the struggle to consolidate peace. "But simply praying and calling for peace cannot guarantee peace; peace must be won through arduous struggle. We are engaged in this struggle."

That same afternoon, Khrushchev delivered a speech at a joint session of the two houses of the Indian Parliament. He spoke about the significance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in the current stage of historical development. He said that due to the tireless and heroic efforts of the people of all countries, there has been a certain relaxation of the international situation.

Khrushchev spoke about the changes in Asian countries that were formerly colonies of imperialism in recent years, saying, "The Soviet people are sincerely happy for the achievements and bright future of the national independent development of Asian countries." He added, "We are also happy for the achievements of the African people's struggle for liberation. They have already taken action and are increasingly actively engaged in the struggle against colonial rule." He said, "The people of Latin America are also increasingly determined to fight for their national and economic independence, and to fight against foreign enslavement, no matter what form this foreign enslavement takes. We have always been and will continue to be consistently sympathetic to countries like Cuba, which are actively struggling to defend their national and economic independence."

That same afternoon, Khrushchev paid a visit to Indian President Prasad and also visited Nehru. In the evening, accompanied by Nehru, they visited the Indian and Soviet pavilions at the World Agricultural Exhibition.
