Xinhua News Agency, February 18th: Various local financial departments are learning and promoting the experience of the financial departments of Jiangyou County, Sichuan Province, in fully supporting the development of production by the communes, and are actively carrying out work to support spring ploughing production.

According to the experience of Jiangyou County, the spring ploughing loan work in various regions this year generally started earlier and acted quickly. Many regions have changed the past "three waiting" phenomena in issuing agricultural loans (waiting for the production season, waiting for the communes to prepare plans, waiting for supply and marketing departments to supply agricultural production materials), and have achieved "three initiatives" (namely, taking the initiative to study with the communes, taking the initiative to help the communes prepare production and financial plans, and taking the initiative to deliver loans to the door), so that the issuance of agricultural loans is ahead of the production season. The national banking system issued 30% more loans in January than in December last year. In many areas, the time for issuing spring ploughing loans was advanced by half a month to a month compared with previous years. The financial departments of Guizhou Province put forward slogans such as "Birds do not urge spring, people urge spring" and "Agricultural loan work should sound the gong to open the way for spring ploughing production." The agricultural loans issued in the first half of January were equivalent to the total amount of loans in the entire month of December last year.

Many grassroots banks and credit cooperatives have promoted the "one investigation, two delivery, three manufacturing" experience created by Jiangyou County in issuing spring ploughing loans: sending a large number of work groups to the people's communes and production teams to investigate their needs for production materials and funds and the existing sources of goods; under the unified leadership of the local party committees, and in close cooperation with the relevant departments, they have launched a vigorous campaign to deliver "grain and grass" to spring ploughing production. By the beginning of February, the banking and commercial departments of thirteen prefectures and municipalities directly under the central government in Sichuan Province had organized more than 1.2 million employees, residents, and financial and trade workers to deliver more than 12.4 million yuan in loans, more than 660,000 pieces of large and small agricultural tools, and more than 200 million catties of fertilizer to 7,567 production teams, effectively supporting spring ploughing production. After the "large delivery," many communes still felt that there was a shortage of production materials, and the cadres of the financial departments cooperated with the commercial departments to help the communes set up "five factories" (namely, local fertilizer factories, local pesticide factories, agricultural tool repair factories, feed factories, and agricultural product processing factories) to produce and supply locally. The Gaoan County Branch of the People's Bank of China in Jiangxi Province, in supporting the industrial production of the communes, created a complete set of experiences in breaking through the equipment barrier, raw material barrier, technical barrier, labor barrier, and capital barrier through the methods of investigation, calculation, management, and delivery, and promoted the establishment of more than 1,300 factories of various types serving agricultural production in the county within a month. It has already produced more than 4 million catties of local fertilizer, local pesticides, and feed, which basically meets the needs of spring ploughing production.

In carrying out the above work, the financial departments in various regions have implemented the experience created by Jiangyou County in supporting poor teams to catch up with rich teams. Whether it is supplying production materials and funds, "running five factories," or developing diversified operations, the main target is poor teams, which has powerfully promoted the economic development of poor teams. The financial departments of Hengnan County in Hunan Province sent a group of cadres to live in poor teams, eating, living, and laboring with the commune members, issuing agricultural loans, and enthusiastically helping the poor teams to formulate plans for developing production and using production funds reasonably, greatly encouraging the determination of the members of these production teams to quickly change the face of the poor teams.

In supporting spring ploughing production, the financial departments in various regions not only unified command and mobilized all internal and external affairs, relevant departments of urban business and rural business departments around the center of spring ploughing production, one task, and common completion; at the same time, under the unified leadership of the local party committees, established "multi-party cooperation," "combined contracts" and other new cooperative relations with agriculture, industry, commerce, transportation and other departments, forming an overall battle to support the spring ploughing production movement, so this work was carried out vigorously, powerfully, and effectively.

### 学习江油经验　积极支援春耕  各地财政金融部门提早发放贷款组织增产农具化肥

    学习江油经验　积极支援春耕
    各地财政金融部门提早发放贷款组织增产农具化肥
    据新华社18日讯　各地财政金融部门学习和推广四川省江油县财政金融部门全力支援公社发展生产的经验，积极开展支援春耕生产工作。
    根据江油县的经验，今年各地的春耕贷款工作一般动手比较早，行动迅速，许多地区改变了过去发放农贷中的“三等待”现象（等生产季节、等公社编好计划、等供销部门供应农业生产资料），做到了“三主动”（即主动和公社研究、主动帮助公社编制生产财务计划，主动送款上门），使农贷的发放走在生产季节的前面。全国银行系统1月份发放的贷款比去年12月增加了30％。不少地区发放春耕贷款的时间比往年提早了半个月到一个月。贵州省金融部门提出“鸟不催春人催春”、“农贷工作要为春耕生产鸣锣开道”等口号，1月上半月发放的农贷相当于去年12月全月的贷款总额。
    许多基层银行和信用社在发放春耕贷款中推广了江油县创造的“一查、二送、三制造”经验：派出大批工作组深入人民公社和生产队，调查它们对生产资料和资金的需要及现有货源情况；在各地党委统一领导下，和各有关部门紧密协作，掀起了千军万马为春耕生产送
  “粮草”的热潮。四川省十三个专区和直辖市的银行、商业部门，到2月初止已经组织职工、居民和财贸工作人员一百二十多万人，向七千五百六十七个生产队送去贷款一千二百四十多万元，大小农具六十六万多件，肥料二亿多斤，有力地支援了春耕生产。在“大送”之后，不少公社生产资料仍感不足，金融部门的干部又和商业部门协作，帮助公社大办“五厂”（即土化肥厂、土农药厂、农具修理厂、饲料厂、农产品加工厂），就地生产、就地供应。人民银行江西省高安县支行在支援社办工业生产中，通过查、算、办、送的办法，创造了一套破设备关、原材料关、技术关、劳力关和资金关的完整经验，推动全县在一个月内办起了各种为农业生产服务的工厂一千三百多座，已经生产出土化肥、土农药和饲料共四百多万斤，基本上满足了春耕生产的需要。
    各地财政金融部门在进行上述工作中都贯彻了江油县创造的支援穷队赶富队的经验，不论供应生产资料和资金、“办五厂”，或者发展多种经营，都是以穷队为主要对象，有力地推动了穷队经济的发展。湖南省衡南县财政金融部门派出一部分干部住在穷队，和社员同吃、同住、同劳动，发放农业贷款，热情地帮助穷队制订发展生产的规划和合理使用生产资金，大大鼓舞了这些生产队社员迅速改变穷队面貌的决心。
    各地财政金融部门在支援春耕生产中，不仅内勤和外勤，城市业务的有关部门和农村业务部门都围绕春耕生产这一中心，统一指挥，全体出动，一个任务，共同完成；同时，在各地党委统一领导下，和农、工、商、交等部门建立了“多边协作”、“结合合同”等多种新的协作关系，形成了支援春耕生产运动的总体战，因此使这项工作开展得轰轰烈烈，声势浩大，效果显著。
