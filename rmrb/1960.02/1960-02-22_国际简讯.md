The upper four levels consist of designated members, official members, and the chairmen of the lowest-level institutions. The result of this vote means that Ayub Khan has continued to hold office as the elected President of Pakistan and is the first President under the future constitution. At the same time, he has been given the power to take all steps he deems necessary to formulate the constitution.

    Ceylon Discovers Fourteenth-Century Buddhist Scripture Manuscript
    Colombo Dispatch: According to a communique issued by the Ceylon Ministry of Culture and Social Services, a manuscript of the famous 14th-century Buddhist scripture, the "Visuddhimagga" (Path of Purification), was discovered in Chilaw County, approximately fifty miles north of Colombo, in November of last year.
    This Buddhist scripture was written in Pali (an ancient Eastern language similar to Sinhala) in the fifth century AD by the famous South Indian scholar Buddhaghosa. The complete translation of it, word for word into Sinhala along with detailed annotations, was completed in the thirteenth century. This work is considered to be of great significance for the study of Buddhism and ancient Ceylonese culture.
