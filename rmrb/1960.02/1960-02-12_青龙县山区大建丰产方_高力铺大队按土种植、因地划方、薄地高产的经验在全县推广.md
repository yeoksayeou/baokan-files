According to a report in the Hebei Daily: The Gaolipu Brigade of the Xiaoyingzi Commune in Qinglong County, Hebei Province, creatively applied the experience of building high-yield plots in the plains to vigorously construct high-yield river flats, high-yield slopes, and high-yield gullies in the mountainous areas. The Qinglong County Party Committee promoted this experience, and a vigorous movement to build high-yield river flats, slopes, and gullies quickly unfolded throughout the county, pushing the county's spring plowing production to a new high tide.

Last year, the Gaolipu Brigade experimented with high-yield river flats, slopes, and gullies on 190 mu of land, not only achieving a large-area, high-yield harvest with an average grain yield of 545 jin per mu, but also driving the entire team to achieve a high average yield of 500 jin per mu. This set up a banner of "mountainous areas can also achieve high yields, and poor land can also produce more grain."

When this brigade promoted the experience of high-yield plots, most commune members firmly supported it, but a few believed that the conditions in the mountainous areas were poor and that the experience of high-yield plots in the plains could not be implemented. The brigade Party branch raised the question, "Are there conditions in the mountainous areas for implementing the experience of high-yield plots?" and organized the broad masses of commune members to speak out and debate. The commune members pointed out: Whether it can be implemented depends on whether we have the drive; we can manage the high-yield experimental plots well, and we will certainly be able to manage the high-yield plots well. Tong Bo, a member of the Party branch committee, said: "We can move rivers and make mountains bow their heads, so why can't we build high-yield plots!" On the basis of unified thinking, the Party branch sent Party branch member Tong Bo and Youth League secretary Ma Guangxing as professional team leaders, and also equipped Party and League members as the backbone to establish a high-yield plot management committee.

In the vigorous high-yield plot movement, this team, based on the characteristics of complex terrain and soil quality in mountainous areas and a wide range of production methods, created a method of "zoning based on soil quality, zoning based on terrain, and zoning based on crops," dividing the entire team into "one river flat, two gullies, seven slopes, and fifteen plots." "One river flat" meant that the relatively flat land on both sides of the river was designated as a high-yield river flat; "two gullies" meant that the Jinji Gully, which had a large area, many barren lands, and a small foundation of fruit trees, was designated as a fruit tree high-yield gully, and the Miaoji Gully, which had a small area, faced the sun, and had sufficient water sources, was designated as a grape gully; "seven slopes" meant that all the slopes in the team were divided into seven high-yield slopes of different sizes, based on the principles of "contiguous land, generally suitable soil quality and crops, and easy management"; "fifteen plots" meant that, based on the characteristics of complex soil quality in the mountainous areas, the team's flat land, slopes, and mountainous land were unified, linked block by block, first dividing crops according to soil quality, and then specifically dividing high-yield plots according to the principles of trying to achieve contiguous cultivation, easy management, and conducive crop growth, so that all crops had plots and all plots increased production.

In the operation and management of high-yield plots, the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture was actively implemented, based on the characteristics of scattered plots and barren soil in mountainous areas. First, small plots were transformed into large plots. Over the past year, more than 230 mu of fragmented small plots have been transformed from more than 170 plots into 46 plots. In addition, terraced fields were built while transforming the plots, so that all 1,200 mu of sloping land in the team were built into horizontal terraced fields and made into furrowed fields, realizing the gardenization of mountainous land. In order to ensure high yields, wells were actively dug to penetrate the riverbed, and stone well chains were built to go up the mountains. Water springs, reservoirs, water tanks, and water cellars were dug on the mountains to realize the irrigation of mountainous land. At the same time, based on the characteristics of mountainous areas such as long distances from home, uneven roads, and laborious manure transportation, fields (pig farms, manure accumulation yards) were built in river flats, gullies, slopes, and plots to accumulate fertilizer locally. In terms of crop allocation, high-stalk crops were interplanted with low-stalk crops, early-maturing crops were intercropped with late-maturing crops, and multiple cropping was generally practiced, based on the characteristics of many slopes, many terraced fields, easy ventilation and light transmission, and many types of soil and fertilizer, which are suitable for planting a variety of crops. Intercropping of corn and millet was generally promoted to increase the multiple cropping index. This planting method can increase production by 50% to 100% compared to single planting.

In terms of labor allocation, fixed professional teams were adopted for high-yield fields, and professional groups were determined according to single-item crop high-yield river flats, gullies, and slopes. Each professional team was divided into five professional groups, such as cotton and wheat, according to production needs and each person's technical expertise, and achieved a close combination of labor specialization and mutual cooperation. For example, before spring sowing, the wheat professional group was too busy watering the returning green water, and other groups actively supported them. When planting cotton, the wheat group supported planting cotton to ensure the timely completion of various production tasks.

The Qinglong County Party Committee believes that the experience of the Gaolipu Production Team is an operating method for developing mountainous production at high speed. Universally promoting this experience can push mountainous agricultural production to a new stage. The County Party Committee held an on-site meeting at the Gaolipu Brigade with the participation of commune Party committee secretaries and production team leaders, comprehensively introduced the team's experience, and called on all communes and teams to launch a movement to build high-yield river flats, slopes, and gullies. This call from the County Party Committee quickly spread throughout the county, and a movement to vigorously build high-yield river flats, gullies, and slopes was launched throughout the county. Although the spring outside the Great Wall was still bitterly cold, everywhere were crowds of people building high-yield river flats, gullies, and slopes, building terraced fields, building square pig farms, and engaging in water conservancy construction. By early February, the county had zoned 250,000 mu of high-yield river flats, gullies, and slopes, expanded the area of irrigated sloping land by 70,000 mu, built more than 3,200 square pig farms, built more than 1,800 square field manure yards, and delivered more than 16 billion jin of fertilizer, reaching 20,000 jin per mu.

    青龙县山区大建丰产方
    高力铺大队按土种植、因地划方、薄地高产的经验在全县推广
    据河北日报报道　河北青龙县肖营子公社高力铺大队，创造性地运用平原建丰产方的经验，在山区大建丰产川、丰产坡、丰产沟。青龙县委推广这一经验，在全县迅速展开了一个声势浩大的建设丰产川、坡、沟运动，把全县春耕生产推向了新高潮。
    高力铺大队去年在一百九十亩土地上试搞丰产川、坡、沟，不仅实现了粮食平均亩产五百四十五斤的大面积高额丰产，还带动全队获得了平均亩产五百斤的高额产量。树起了“山区也能搞丰产、薄地也能多打粮”的旗帜。
    这个大队推行丰产方的经验时，大多数社员坚决支持，但也有少数人认为山区条件差，不能推行平原丰产方经验。大队党支部提出“山区究竟有没有条件推行丰产方经验？”组织广大社员鸣放辩论。社员们提出：能不能推行，就看有没有干劲；我们能搞好丰产试验田，也一定能搞好丰产方。党支部委员佟波说：“咱能让大河搬家，让高山低头，为什么不能搞丰产方！”在统一思想的基础上，党支部派支部委员佟波、团支部书记马广兴担任专业队长，还配备党团员作骨干，建立丰产方管理委员会。
    这个队在大搞丰产方运动中，根据山区地势、土质复杂，生产门路广的特点，创造了“因土质、因地势、因作物划方”的办法，把全队划成“一川、二沟、七坡、十五方”。“一川”，就是把河川两岸较平坦地都划为丰产川；“二沟”，就是把面积大、荒地多、有少量果树基础的金鸡沟划为果树丰产沟，把面积小、坡向阳、水源充足的庙鸡沟划为葡萄沟；“七坡”，就是把全队所有的坡地，本着“土地连片、土质作物大体适宜、便于经营”的原则，划成大小不同的七个丰产坡；“十五方”，就是根据山区土质复杂的特点，把全队平地、坡地、山地进行统一站队，逐块挂钩，首先因土质划作物，再根据尽可能做到耕种连片、便于经营、利于作物生长的原则，具体地划分丰产方，使样样作物有方，方方增产。
    在丰产方的经营管理上，根据山区地块零散、土质瘠薄的特点，积极贯彻农业“八字宪法”。首先把小块地改大块，一年来已改出零碎小块地二百三十多亩，由过去一百七十多块改成四十六块；另外，边改地块、边修梯田，使全队一千二百多亩坡地全部修成水平梯田，并做成畦田，实现了山地园田化。为了保证高产，积极打透河井、搞石井连环上山，在山上挖水泉、蓄水池、水柜、水窖等，使山地也实现了水利化。同时，根据山区地离家远、道路不平，运粪费工等特点，在川、沟、坡、方内建场（猪场、积粪场），就地积肥。在作物配置上，根据坡地多、梯田多，易于通风透光，和土壤、肥料种类多，适宜种植多种作物等特点，普遍实行了高秆作物与低秆作物、早熟作物与晚熟作物间种套种复种，普遍地推行了玉米、谷子间作，提高了复种指数。这种种植方法，比单一种植可增产50％到一倍。
    在劳力配备上，采取了以丰产田固定专业队，按单项作物丰产川、沟、坡确定专业小组。各专业队又根据生产需要和各人的技术专长，划成棉花、小麦等五个专业小组，并做到劳力专业化与相互协作紧密结合。例如春播前，小麦专业组浇返青水忙不开，其他小组就积极支援；种棉时，小麦组又支援植棉，保证了按时完成各项生产任务。
    青龙县委认为高力铺生产队的经验是高速度发展山区生产的经营方法，普遍推广这一经验，就可以把山区农业生产推向新的阶段。县委在高力铺大队召开了有公社党委书记和生产队长参加的现场会议，全面介绍了这个队的经验，并号召各社队开展建设丰产川、坡、沟的运动。县委这一号召迅速传遍全县，一个大建丰产川、沟、坡的运动在全县火热展开。塞外的春天，虽然还是寒风凛凛，但到处都是建丰产川、沟、坡，修梯田、建方田猪场、搞水利建设的人群。到2月上旬，全县划丰产川、沟、坡二十五万亩，扩大坡田水浇地七万亩，方田建猪场三千二百多个，建方田地头粪场一千八百多个，送肥一百六十多亿斤，每亩达到二万斤。
