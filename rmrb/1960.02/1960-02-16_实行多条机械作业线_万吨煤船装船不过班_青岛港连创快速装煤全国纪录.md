Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 15th - Qingdao Port workers have implemented multiple mechanical operation lines for fast coal loading, and recently continuously set a national record by loading nine 10,000-ton coal ships within one shift (meaning all coal loaded within eight hours), which is two-thirds faster than the "10,000-ton coal ship within one day" requirement set by the Ministry of Communications' Haihe General Bureau. According to statistics from the "Peace May 1st," "May 2nd," and "May 553rd" freighters operating on the Qingdao-Shanghai route, due to rapid coal loading, each ship increased from less than five voyages in January to more than six voyages, transporting an additional 45,000 tons of coal for the country.

These new high-yield records are the result of Qingdao Port workers engaging in technical innovation and revolution. With a spirit of continuous revolution, the port's workers proposed a total of 9,740 innovation suggestions last year. Through indigenous methods and a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, relying on their own efforts, they overcame numerous difficulties and successfully trial-produced and manufactured 1,235 pieces of machinery and tools. In order to fully utilize and leverage the role of these loading and unloading machines, with the close cooperation and support of relevant units, the workers have also matched belt conveyors, universal buckets, cranes, coal scraping machines, water cranes, and other loading and unloading machinery suitable for loading and unloading bulk cargo according to hatch, forming a serialized mechanical loading and unloading operation line. They have developed from single-line coal loading at one hatch at a time to multi-line mechanical operation at all hatches simultaneously. For example, when the "Peace May 1st" ship entered the port for coal loading on the afternoon of the 12th, 56 stevedores used more than 30 different types of machinery to carry out rapid coal loading at eleven heads (i.e., eleven lines) at five hatches. With half the number of stevedores compared to the past, the ship loading efficiency was more than three times higher than last year, and 10,000 tons of coal were loaded in only five hours and forty minutes.

Strengthening coordination between the port and the ships is an important condition for creating an unprecedented record of fast coal loading. The Shanghai Maritime Bureau's crew members would telegraph the port each time during the voyage, proposing guarantees for ship loading conditions, and prepare various ship loading preparations such as lifting booms and opening hatch covers before the ship docked. After the ship docked, they actively participated in coal loading operations, helping to repair and manufacture loading and unloading machine parts, which played a great role in achieving rapid coal loading.

Currently, the proportion of mechanical operation in the port's loading and unloading operations has increased from 57% to over 80%. Manual lifting and carrying are no longer used, the number of stevedores has been reduced by 35%, and the port's throughput has increased by nearly 100%.

Recently, leading cadres from Dalian, Qinhuangdao, Tianjin, Shanghai and other ports, under the organization of the Ministry of Communications, visited Qingdao Port for observation. They unanimously affirmed that Qingdao Port's fast ship loading experience is advanced and mature. The Ministry of Communications' Haihe General Bureau has decided to promote it widely in major and medium-sized ports across the country, so as to further improve the efficiency of loading and unloading at ports.

### 实行多条机械作业线　万吨煤船装船不过班  青岛港连创快速装煤全国纪录

    实行多条机械作业线　万吨煤船装船不过班
    青岛港连创快速装煤全国纪录
    新华社青岛15日电　青岛港职工实行多条机械作业线快速装煤，最近连续创造了九艘万吨煤船装船不过班的全国最高纪录（即在八小时内将煤全部装好），比交通部海河总局提出的“万吨煤船不过天”的要求又加快了三分之二。据往返青岛——上海航线上的和平五一、五二、五五三艘货轮统计，由于快速装煤，1月份每艘轮船由过去不足五个航次增加到六个航次以上，为国家多运输煤炭四万五千吨。
    这些高产新纪录，是青岛港职工大闹技术革新和技术革命的结果。这个港的职工以不断革命的精神，在去年共提出革新建议九千七百四十件，通过由土到洋、土洋并举、自力更生的办法，克服重重困难，试制和制造成功了一千二百三十五件机械和工具。为了充分利用和发挥这些装卸机械的作用，职工们在各有关单位的密切协作和支援下，又把适合装卸散货的皮带机、万能斗、吊车、扒煤机、水吊等装卸机具，按舱口配套，组成机械系列化装卸作业线，并且从一个舱口一个舱口地单线装煤，发展成为各个舱口同时实行多条机械作业线装煤。如12日下午和平五一号轮进港装煤时，五十六名装卸工人用各种机械三十多部，在五个舱口分十一个头（即十一条线）进行快速装煤，在装卸工人比过去减少一半的情况下，装船效率比去年提高三倍以上，仅用五小时四十分钟就装完了一万吨煤炭。
    港、船之间加强协作配合，是创造快速装煤空前纪录的一项重要条件。上海海运局的船员每次在航行途中即电告港方，提出装船保证条件，在船只靠岸前作好起吊杆、开舱盖等各种装船准备工作；船只停靠码头后，他们又积极参加装煤作业，帮助修理制配装卸机械零件，对实现快速装煤起了很大作用。
    现在，这个港口的装卸作业中，机械操作的比重已由过去的57％提高到80％以上，不再用人力扛抬，装卸工人减少35％，而港口吞吐量却比过去增长了将近一倍。
    最近，大连、秦皇岛、天津、上海等港口的领导干部，在交通部的组织下，到青岛港观摩。他们一致肯定青岛港的快速装船经验是先进的，成熟的。交通部海河总局决定在全国各大、中港口普遍推广，使港口的装卸效率再提高一步。
