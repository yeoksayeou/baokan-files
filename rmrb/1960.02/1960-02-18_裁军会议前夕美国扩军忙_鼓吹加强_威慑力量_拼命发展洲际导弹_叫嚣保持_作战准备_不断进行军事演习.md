This newspaper comprehensive report: The East-West Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee is about to begin its meeting. Before the meeting, the Soviet Union has made significant contributions to promoting universal disarmament by deciding to reduce its armed forces by another 1.2 million troops. Although the U.S. officialdom verbally expresses its "sincerity" for disarmament, it is actually stepping up its arms expansion and war preparations in order to hinder the progress of the disarmament conference and the resolution of disarmament issues, and to continue to pursue its policy of aggression and expansion. Over the past month, while engaging in a propaganda campaign of "flaunting American strength" and engaging in fierce disputes over the issue of missiles and lagging behind the Soviet Union in the exploration of outer space, the United States has tried its best to incite an atmosphere of intensified war preparation, clamoring to catch up with the Soviet Union rapidly in missile development.

Eisenhower repeatedly emphasized at press conferences that missile weapons should be vigorously developed, and that in the exploration of outer space, it should "not always think of following behind others." Although he admitted that the 1960 appropriations for various missiles "have approached the point where money itself cannot speed up the rate or speed up development," he still demanded an increase in appropriations for research into large rocket engines.

American newspapers also revealed, with a great deal of material, that the United States is frantically carrying out plans to develop intercontinental missiles, attempting to change the current backward state of relying mainly on strategic air force and supplemented by missiles by 1963, so that intercontinental missiles become the main "deterrent force." American newspapers revealed that, in order to achieve "high mobility" and "good concealment" in strategic terms, the United States is currently concentrating its efforts on developing "Minuteman" intercontinental missiles launched from underground launch pads and using solid fuel, "Polaris" intermediate-range missiles launched from submarines underwater, and "Hound Dog" air-to-surface intermediate-range missiles launched from B52G bombers. The Air Force plans to build twenty-seven missile squadrons equipped with one hundred and thirty "Atlas" and one hundred and forty "Titan" intercontinental missiles by 1963, of which twenty squadrons will be launched from underground launch sites. The current focus is on the development of "Minuteman" intercontinental missiles. According to a report in "Newsweek" on January 25, the U.S. government is striving to successfully test this missile by 1963 and produce 800 of them. At the same time, it is planned that by 1963, twenty-eight B52G bomber squadrons (four hundred and twenty aircraft) equipped with "Hound Dog" missiles will be built, and the first squadron is scheduled to be incorporated into the Strategic Air Command this summer. The Navy's focus is on developing nuclear-powered deep-sea submarines carrying sixteen "Polaris" missiles. The Chief of Naval Operations recently requested that the total number of submarines launching "Polaris" missiles be increased to forty-five, and requested an appropriation of 975 million US dollars to build six more ships next year in addition to the three planned. In addition, there are plans to install "Polaris" missile launchers on merchant ships and cruisers. The United States is also stepping up the construction of airports in the country. The "Atlas" missile underground launch pad at Lincoln Air Force Base in Nebraska has already started construction, and another four intercontinental missile bases are being prepared to be built, bringing the number of intercontinental missile bases under construction and planned to be built in the United States to fourteen.

At the same time, according to American newspapers, the United States is strengthening its strategic air force and expanding its intermediate-range missile bases surrounding socialist countries, attempting to use this as the main nuclear weapons attack force to offset the current Soviet missile advantage. The February 1st issue of "U.S. News & World Report" stated that because the Air Force is still the main "deterrent force," this year's new budget will use 6 billion US dollars to manufacture 1,510 new B52H and B58 jet bombers to replace outdated aircraft. The United States has accelerated the construction of seven intermediate-range missile bases in Britain, Italy, and Turkey. According to a Reuters report on February 4, the United States is preparing to ship forty-five "Jupiter" intermediate-range missiles to Italy and Turkey in the near future and is stepping up negotiations with Spain to establish intercontinental missile bases. Greek newspapers also reported that the Greek government has agreed to establish an intermediate-range missile base on Crete. In the Far East, according to a UPI report on the 9th, the United States will send a new missile battalion to Okinawa to strengthen the existing two "Nike-Hercules" missile battalions. In addition to negotiating with Canada on the issue of arming its troops with nuclear weapons, the United States is accelerating the arming of West German forces with atomic weapons. According to West German newspapers, by the end of this year, West Germany will establish four missile battalions equipped with "Hercules" intermediate-range missiles and possessing two hundred and seventy-six launch pads.

U.S. Secretary of Defense Gates, in his testimony to Congress, repeatedly emphasized that the United States must both "improve" its "retaliatory capability" in a full-scale war and ensure its ability to conduct "local wars." Secretary of the Army Bruck also clamored that the Army should maintain "high combat readiness." Under the guidance of this strategic thinking, the United States is currently actively developing conventional forces equipment. According to the February 1st issue of "U.S. News & World Report," the Army maintains 870,000 troops, and the new budget will allocate 9.4 billion US dollars to the Army for "modernization equipment" to strengthen "strike force." It will be equipped with a large number of M60 new-type tanks and a "Davy Crockett" light rocket that can be loaded with nuclear warheads. The Navy's military expenditure reaches 11.7 billion US dollars. The new warships added next year will be the largest increase since the war, except for 1955, including one nuclear-powered cruiser, three aircraft carriers (one nuclear-powered), and sixteen missile-equipped destroyers and fast ships. Secretary of the Army Bruck admitted in his testimony that a Southeast Asia combat plan has been drawn up.

In the past half-month, the United States, in collusion with the vassal states of its military blocs, has conducted a series of provocative military exercises around the world. In Europe, it conducted exercises using atomic weapons with West German troops on the border of the German Democratic Republic, and held joint military exercises with Spain and Portugal on the Pyrenees Peninsula. In the Middle East, it dispatched an air force unit to Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan to conduct air demonstration exercises; in Southeast Asia, it colluded with British, Australian, and Thai troops to conduct joint exercises in the Gulf of Siam, and conducted provocative exercises in the Taiwan Strait area in collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek group; in Latin America, it held amphibious landing exercises on Vieques Island in Puerto Rico, openly threatening to suppress countries striving for national independence, and planned to gather Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru and other countries in March to hold military exercises in the Panama Canal area.

The above are only a few aspects of the recent U.S. war preparations, but they are enough to illustrate whether the United States is sincere about disarmament.

### 裁军会议前夕美国扩军忙  鼓吹加强“威慑力量”  拼命发展洲际导弹  叫嚣保持“作战准备”  不断进行军事演习

    裁军会议前夕美国扩军忙
    鼓吹加强“威慑力量”  拼命发展洲际导弹
    叫嚣保持“作战准备”  不断进行军事演习
    本报综合报道：东西方十国裁军委员会最近就要开始举行会议。在会议之前，苏联已经为促进普遍裁军作出了重大的贡献，决定再次裁减武装部队一百二十万人。美国官方虽然口头上也表示有裁军“诚意”，但实际上却在最近加紧了扩军备战的行动，以便阻挠裁军会议的进行和裁军问题的解决，继续推行其侵略扩张的政策。一个月来，美国在进行“夸耀美国实力”的宣传运动和在导弹和探索外层空间落后于苏联问题上展开激烈争吵的同时，竭力煽动加紧备战的气氛，叫嚷要在导弹发展方面迅速赶上苏联。
    艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上一再强调要大力发展导弹武器，在探索外层空间方面也“不是老是想跟在别人后面”。尽管他承认1960年各种导弹的拨款“已接近金钱本身不能再加快速度、加快发展的地步”，但仍要求增加研究大型火箭引擎的拨款。
    美国报纸也以大量的材料，透露美国正在疯狂地进行发展洲际导弹的计划，企图在1963年改变目前以战略空军为主、导弹为辅的落后状态，从而使洲际导弹成为主要“威慑力量”。美国报纸透露，为了求得在战略上的“高度机动”和“良好隐蔽”，美国目前集中力量发展从地下发射台发射、使用固体燃料的“民兵”式洲际导弹；从水底由潜艇发射的“北极星”中程导弹，和从B52G型轰炸机上发射的“猎狗式”空对地中程导弹。空军计划在1963年建成二十七个装备一百三十枚“阿特拉斯”和一百四十枚“大力神”洲际导弹的导弹中队，其中有二十个中队将从地下发射场发射。目前重点是发展“民兵”式洲际导弹。据1月25日“新闻周刊”报道，美国政府力求在1963年把这种导弹试验成功，并且生产八百枚。同时，计划到1963年，将建成装备“猎狗式”导弹的二十八个B52G轰炸机中队（四百二十架），第一个中队准备在今夏编入战略空军司令部。海军方面的重点是发展携带十六枚“北极星”导弹的核动力深水潜艇。海军作战参谋长最近要求把发射“北极星”导弹潜艇总数增到四十五艘，并且要求拨款九亿七千五百万美元，以便在明年计划三艘之外再增造六艘。此外，还计划在商船和巡洋舰装上“北极星”导弹发射器。美国并在国内加紧建筑机场，内布拉斯加州林肯空军基地“阿特拉斯”导弹地下发射台已经开工，另有四个洲际导弹基地正在准备动工，使美国国内正在修建和计划修建的洲际导弹基地增加到十四个。
    与此同时，据美国报纸透露，美国正在加强战略空军，扩充包围社会主义阵营国家的中程导弹基地，企图以此作为主要的核武器攻击力量，以抵销目前苏联导弹的优势。2月1日的“美国新闻与世界报道”说，由于空军仍然是主要“威慑力量”，因此，今年新预算将以六十亿美元制造一千五百一十架新式的B52H和B58式喷气轰炸机，代替过时的飞机。美国加速了修建在英、意、土的七个中程导弹基地工程。据路透社2月4日消息，美国准备在最近将运四十五枚“丘辟特”中程导弹到意大利和土耳其，并加紧同西班牙进行建立际洲导弹基地谈判。希腊报纸也传出希腊政府已同意在克里特岛建立一个中程导弹基地。在远东方面，据合众国际社9日消息，美国将派遣一个新导弹营到冲绳岛，加强原有的两个“奈克—赫尔克里士”导弹营。美国除了正在同加拿大谈判用核武器武装军队问题外，美国正加速用原子武器武装西德部队，据西德报纸报道，到今年年底，西德将建立四个配备“赫尔克里士”中程导弹并拥有二百七十六个发射台的导弹营。
    美国国防部长盖茨在国会作证时，再三强调美国既要“改进”全面战争的“报复能力”，并且要保证进行“局部战争”的能力。陆军部长布鲁克也叫嚷陆军要保持“高度作战准备”。在这种战略思想指导下，美国目前正在积极进行发展常规部队装备。据2月1日一期“美国新闻与世界报道”说，陆军维持八十七万人，新预算将给陆军九十四亿美元进行“现代化装备”以加强“打击力量”，将大量配备M60型新式坦克和一种“戴维·克罗克特”能装上核弹头的轻型火箭，海军军费达一百一十七亿美元，明年新增加的战舰，除1955年外，将为战后增加最多的一年，其中包括核动力巡洋舰一艘，航空母舰三艘（一艘核动力）和十六艘装有导弹的驱逐舰和快速舰等。美国陆军部长布鲁克在作证时承认已拟订了东南亚作战计划。
    最近半个多月来，美国伙同军事集团的仆从国家，在全世界范围内进行了一连串的挑衅性军事演习。在欧洲，同西德军队在德意志民主共和国边境进行使用原子武器演习，又在比利牛斯半岛同西班牙、葡萄牙举行军事联合演习，在中东，派遣一支空军部队，到土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦进行空中示威演习；在东南亚，纠合英、澳和泰国军队，在暹罗湾举行联合演习，并且在台湾海峡地区伙同蒋介石集团接连进行挑衅性演习；在拉丁美洲，在波多黎各维克斯岛举行两栖部队登陆演习，公开威胁要镇压争取民族独立国家，并且计划在3月间纠集巴西、智利、哥伦比亚、秘鲁等国，在巴拿马运河地区举行军事演习。
    以上仅仅是美国最近备战活动的几个方面，但是已足以说明美国究竟有没有裁军诚意了。
