　　Zhongxian County Treats All 50,000 Mu of Rapeseed Fields for Pests Four or Five Times
　　Linchuan Vigorously Carries Out Inter-tillage and Topdressing to Prevent Premature Bolting of Rapeseed

　　(Our report) Zhongxian County, Sichuan Province, is vigorously launching a campaign to prevent and control rapeseed pests and diseases. Due to the mild climate and high humidity this past winter and spring, the incidence of rapeseed pests and diseases in Zhongxian County this year accounts for approximately 20% of the total area, with a damage rate of 15%, seriously affecting the normal growth of rapeseed.

　　During the initial outbreak of rapeseed pests and diseases, the Zhongxian County Party Committee mobilized the masses to comprehensively summarize last year's experience in pest and disease control. Pest and disease control headquarters and guidance groups were established at the county, district, and commune levels. The county established 23,000 rapeseed pest control groups, with 75,000 people, adopting the method of dividing areas into sections, assigning tasks to groups, assigning responsibility to individuals, and setting deadlines for elimination. Currently, the prevention and control of rapeseed pests has formed a mass upsurge. Yan Changlu, Secretary of the Wuyang District Party Committee, personally led more than 400 pest control groups to apply pesticides to more than 5,400 mu of rapeseed in two days. Various localities have also organized more than 1,500 field consultation teams to go deep into the fields for roving inspections, diagnosing problems, and prescribing remedies accordingly. Zhang Peiru, First Secretary of the County Party Committee, led cadres and technicians to discover aphids, cabbage caterpillars, cutworms, black spot disease, sclerotinia disease, and root rot in the rapeseed fields of Ruxi Commune. He promptly studied prevention and control measures and decided to universally attack pests throughout the county, applying pesticides to 50,000 mu of rapeseed fields once within three days. Some places, while spraying pesticides, also combined this with inter-tillage, weeding, removing diseased plants, and pruning diseased and yellow bottom leaves, ensuring loose soil, weed-free fields, and drainage of stagnant water, effectively controlling the spread of rapeseed pests and diseases.

　　In order to ensure the supply of pesticides, the county adopted a combination of indigenous and modern methods, using local materials, and established more than 550 pesticide factories, producing more than 2.9 million jin of pesticides, which played a significant role in preventing and controlling rapeseed pests and diseases.

　　Currently, the 50,000 mu of rapeseed in the county have generally been treated for pests four or five times, with some being treated as many as eight or nine times. Some yellowed diseased seedlings and pest-ridden seedlings have begun to turn green after being sprayed with pesticides.

　　(Our report) Linchuan County, Jiangxi Province, has taken timely measures to prevent premature bolting of rapeseed.

　　More than 100,000 mu of rapeseed sown in Linchuan County last winter are mostly growing well due to meticulous winter management. However, due to abnormal weather since winter and spring, especially the heavy snow after spring, a small number of rapeseed plants that were sown later, insufficiently fertilized, and did not grow well enough over the winter experienced early bolting. In response to this situation, under the timely leadership of the County Party Committee, the county organized more than 50,000 laborers to adopt methods such as comprehensive ditch clearing and drainage, and vigorous inter-tillage and topdressing to prevent early bolting.

　　Comprehensive ditch clearing and drainage in rapeseed fields can keep the soil in the rapeseed fields dry, appropriately increase the ground temperature, and accelerate the growth of rapeseed. For example, in order to do this work well, Luohu Commune organized more than 1,000 laborers, formed professional teams, and launched a concentrated effort for three days after the Spring Festival. As a result, the side ditches of more than 1,000 mu of rapeseed fields were universally repaired and deepened, eliminating stagnant water. Now, the rapeseed is generally growing well. In Guanghua Production Brigade of this commune, the snow in the ditches of more than 30 mu of rapeseed fields had not melted, and the snow water in the fields could not be drained, causing the rapeseed to exhibit early bolting. The entire team immediately cleared the snow, applied fertilizer, and ensured that the seedlings quickly returned to green growth.

　　Inter-tillage to loosen the soil and topdressing with fertilizer are also effective ways to prevent early bolting of rapeseed. Since the beginning of spring, all rapeseed in the county has undergone one inter-tillage and one topdressing, with an average of more than 20 dan of quick-acting human urine, wood ash, and burnt soil ash applied per mu of rapeseed field, making the large areas of rapeseed grow more luxuriantly after wintering.

　　For a small number of rapeseed plants that have already shown early bolting, various communes have promptly organized commune members to carry out prevention and control measures to prevent the development of early bolting.

### 消灭油菜病虫害在初发期  忠县五万亩油菜全部治虫四五次  临川大搞中耕追肥不让油菜早抽苔

    消灭油菜病虫害在初发期
    忠县五万亩油菜全部治虫四五次
    临川大搞中耕追肥不让油菜早抽苔
    本报讯　四川忠县大力开展防治油菜病虫害的突击运动。由于去冬今春气候温和，湿度大，今年忠县油菜病虫发生量约占总面积20％，危害率达15％，严重影响油菜的正常生长。
    忠县县委在油菜病虫初发期，就发动群众全面总结了去年防治病虫的经验，县、区、公社层层建立了病虫防治指挥部和指导小组。全县成立了七万五千人的二万三千个油菜防治虫害小组，采取划片分段，任务到组，责任到人，限期消灭的办法，目前防治油菜病虫已形成群众性的高潮。乌羊区委书记阎长禄亲自带领四百多个治虫小组，两天内给五千四百多亩油菜施了一次农药。各地还组织田间会诊队一千五百多个，深入田间，巡回检查，发现问题，对症下药。县委第一书记张培儒带领干部和技术员在汝溪公社油菜园发现了蚜蝼、菜青虫、夜盗虫、黑斑病、菌核病、根腐病以后，及时研究了防治措施和办法，并决定在全县普遍突击治虫，三天内给五万亩油菜普遍治虫一次。有些地方在药械喷杀的同时，还结合进行了中耕除草，拔除病株，剪去病黄脚叶等工作，做到了土壤疏松、田无杂草、沟无渍水，有效地控制了油菜病虫的蔓延。
    为了保证农药需要，全县采取土洋并举、就地取材的办法，建立农药厂五百五十多个，制成农药二百九十多万斤，对防治油菜病虫害起了巨大作用。
    目前，全县五万亩油菜一般已治虫四、五次，有的多达八、九次，部分发黄的病苗、虫苗，经过药物喷杀以后，已开始转青。
    本报讯　江西临川县及时采取措施，防治油菜早苔。
    临川县去冬播种的十多万亩油菜，由于越冬管理细致，目前大部分生长良好。但是，冬春以来由于气候不够正常，特别是春后大雪，使少数原来种得较晚、施肥不足、越冬生长不够好的油菜发生了早期抽苔现象。针对这一情况，在县委及时领导下，全县组织了五万多名劳动力，采取全面清沟排水、大搞中耕追肥等办法，防治早苔。
    对油菜田全面进行清沟排水，可使油菜田的土壤保持干燥，适当增高地温，加快油菜的生长。如罗湖公社为了做好这一工作，全社组织了一千多个劳动力，组成专业队，春节后突击三天，结果将一千多亩油菜田的边沟普遍进行了一次整修和加深，排除了渍水，现在油菜普遍生长良好。这个公社光华生产大队有三十多亩油菜田的水沟积雪未化，田里的雪水排不出去，油菜呈现出早苔现象，全队立即铲除积雪，追施肥料，保证菜苗迅速返青生长。
    中耕松土，追施肥料，也是防治油菜早苔的有效办法。开春以来，全县油菜都进行了一次中耕松土和一次追肥，每亩油菜田平均追施了速效性的人尿、草木灰、火土灰等肥料二十多担，使大面积油菜在越冬后生长得更加茂盛。
    对少数已经出现早苔的油菜，各公社已及时组织社员进行防治，制止早苔发展。
