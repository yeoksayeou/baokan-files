Wang Baojing is going to college! The news immediately caused a sensation at Northwest Agricultural College.

On the afternoon of February 7th, Wang Baojing had just gotten off the train, and a group of college students who had come to greet him immediately surrounded him, vying to shake his hand. A male student pointed to a female student and said to Wang Baojing, "She is the entertainment minister of our student union. If you want to dance, just find her." They asked this and that, talking and laughing, as they walked towards the school. This young farmer, in this way, surrounded by his classmates, stepped into the threshold of the university for the first time as a college student.

For Northwest Agricultural College, Wang Baojing is a new student, but also an old acquaintance. Since 1955, Northwest Agricultural College has frequently sent professors and students to the Fenghuo Production Team (formerly Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative) in Qian County, led by Wang Baojing, to help them summarize production experience, impart scientific knowledge, and cultivate technical talents. Wang Baojing also frequently went to Northwest Agricultural College for advice on scientific and technological issues encountered in production; at the same time, he also brought his advanced production experience created in production and research and new problems raised in practice to Northwest Agricultural College. In 1958, Northwest Agricultural College also invited Wang Baojing to give three lectures to students, teaching hybrid breeding, corn cultivation techniques, and ventilation and light transmission experiments. Over the past few years, Wang Baojing has established a close friendship with Northwest Agricultural College. Now that Wang Baojing has officially come to Northwest Agricultural College as a student, how can it not excite all the teachers and students of the school!

The news of Wang Baojing going to college had an even greater impact in his hometown than at Northwest Agricultural College. In the days when Wang Baojing was about to leave the village (Bailinggong Village) to go to college, this matter simply became a frequent topic of discussion. Before liberation, Bailinggong Village didn't even have a higher elementary school graduate, let alone a college student. Now, Wang Baojing is actually going to college. No wonder the oldest old man in the village, Wang Dacheng, said with emotion: "From the Guangxu years until now, I have never heard of a farmer going to college! Baojing going to college is Chairman Mao promoting us farmers!" Wang Daxin, who is over seventy years old, said: "There is no such thing in ancient and modern wonders!" However, Wang Baojing going to college, in the new China, in the Mao Zedong era, what is so rare about it! After liberation, like all rural areas, the cultural and technical level of Bailinggong Village has improved rapidly. Up to now, there are a total of one hundred and five higher elementary school students and forty-seven middle school students. Wang Baojing's mother, old lady Du Yuanxian, didn't even know her own name in the past. After liberation, she voluntarily signed up to learn culture and is now able to write letters. When Wang Baojing left home, she personally wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, thanking the Party and Chairman Mao for their cultivation and care for her son. The villagers also repeatedly urged Wang Baojing to study hard and repay the Party's cultivation.

Wang Baojing, the son of a poor peasant, only studied for a year and a half before liberation because he could not afford the tuition. In the ten years after liberation, under the cultivation of the Party and through practical exercise, he rapidly improved his cultural and scientific and technological level, and transformed from an ordinary peasant into a special farmer researcher at the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

Does Wang Baojing have the qualifications to go to college? There is no need to doubt this. Wang Baojing has studied part of the courses of agricultural colleges and universities on his own, such as wheat and corn cultivation techniques in "Soil Science" and "Crop Cultivation," the Maltsev tillage method in "Tillage Science," and other books. He can write his own speech outlines. In practice, he has achieved amazing achievements. Together with the members of the cooperative, he has carried out one hundred and sixty-two agricultural scientific research projects, and has successively selected and bred fifteen new varieties using sexual hybridization and asexual hybridization; he has developed a set of corn high-yield technology and experience suitable for local cultivation, which has increased the yield per mu of corn from the original two or three hundred jin to one thousand three, one thousand five, one thousand seven, and two thousand one hundred jin; he has also successfully conducted experiments using sunlight—wide-row intercropping and interplanting tillage methods, providing rich and valuable data for preventing wheat lodging and reducing cotton boll shedding...

Wang Baojing's improvement in cultural, scientific, and technological level was completely obtained in daily practice. In the early days of liberation, he felt novel when he first heard agricultural technology extension station technicians talk about scientific knowledge such as artificial pollination, irrigation, fertilization, and pest control. From then on, he began to enter his own "field university." He learned a lot from visits, many meetings, many leading comrades and scientific and technical personnel, and his own field experiments and research. What impressed him the most were these two things: once he went to the Soviet Union for a visit, and agricultural scientist Lysenko received him in Moscow. He asked Lysenko how to do scientific research. Lysenko said meaningfully: "Where does science come from?...Science is created by people in practice." Another time, someone muttered behind his back that the research he was doing was not the right direction. Just then, Zhang Desheng, First Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, went to their agricultural cooperative to inspect and said to him:
“That’s right! Just do it like this. Doing is learning, farmers must study science.” He was greatly encouraged, and he firmly remembered these words. He did, he learned, and his cultural level and scientific and technological level rapidly improved.

But Wang Baojing still felt it was not enough. He had made many achievements, but he could not explain them scientifically. He felt that not only should he achieve something, but he also had to know why. "How wonderful it would be to study some basic theoretical knowledge at Northwest Agricultural College!" In the past two years, this idea has been constantly appearing in his mind. Now, his wish has been fulfilled, and the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to send him to Northwest Agricultural College for further study.

On the morning of the 9th, Wang Baojing took his first class in college—"Botany." The lecturer was Zhang Zhimin, a lecturer in the Agronomy Department. She had worked and trained in the Fenghuo Production Team where Wang Baojing was located, and had learned a lot of practical production experience from Wang Baojing there. Now that she was going to explain theoretical knowledge to Wang Baojing, how could she not feel particularly happy. Now, Wang Baojing is sitting upright in the classroom of the Agronomy Department. On the ordinary farmer's black cotton-padded jacket he is wearing is pinned the school badge of "Northwest Agricultural College." He is listening attentively and taking notes carefully. After class, when others asked him how he was doing, he clenched his fist, slammed it on his leg, and said confidently: "No problem, I can understand. I also want to guarantee a good start, learn the first day's course well, and report the good news to the school Party committee in the evening; learn the whole course well, and offer it to the Party and Chairman Mao!

    王保京上大学
    本报记者　张安南　韩国英
    王保京上大学了！这个消息传出去，立刻轰动了西北农学院。
    2月7日下午，王保京刚刚下了火车，前去迎接他的一群大学生，马上把他团团围住，抢着和他握手。一位男同学指着一位女同学对王保京说：“她是咱们学生会的文娱部长。你想跳舞，就找她。”他们问这问那，说着笑着，向学校走去。这个年青的农民，就这样在同学们的簇拥下，第一次作为一个大学生，迈进了大学校的门槛。
    对于西北农学院说来，王保京是它的新学生，但又是老相识。1955年以来，西北农学院经常派教授、学生到王保京领导的乾县烽火生产队（原烽火农业社），帮助他们总结生产经验，传授科学知识，培养技术人材。王保京在生产上碰到一些科学技术问题，也经常到西北农学院去请教；同时，也把自己在生产和研究中创造的先进生产经验和实践中提出的新问题，带给西北农学院。1958年，西北农学院还请王保京给学生上过三次课，讲授杂交育种、玉米栽培技术和通风透光等试验。几年来，王保京就和西北农学院建立了亲密的友谊。现在，王保京又作为学生，正式到西北农学院来学习，怎能不使全校师生为之振奋呢！
    王保京上大学的消息，在他家乡发生的影响，比起西北农学院来，还要大得多。王保京要离开村子（白灵宫村）上大学的那几天，这件事简直成了人们经常议论的话题。解放前，白灵宫村不用说大学生，连个高小毕业生都没有。现在呢，王保京居然要上大学了。难怪全村最老的老人王大成感慨地说：“打光绪年间起到如今，我还没听过农民上大学哩！保京上大学是毛主席提拔咱们农民啊！”七十多岁的王大信讲：“今古奇观里也没这号事情呀！”但是，王保京上大学了，这在新中国，在毛泽东时代，又算得上什么稀罕事呢！解放以后，和所有的农村一样，白灵宫村的文化技术水平提高得很快。到现在，高小学生共有一百零五个，中学生有四十七个。王保京的母亲杜元贤老太太，过去连自己的名字也不认识。解放后，她自愿报名学文化，现在已能写信了。王保京离家的时候，她亲自给毛主席写了一封信，感激党和毛主席对自己儿子的培养和关怀。乡亲们也都千叮咛万嘱咐，要王保京好好学习，回答党的栽培。
    王保京，这个贫农的儿子，解放前只念过一年半书，因为交不起学费退了学。解放后的十年当中，他在党的培养下，在实践的锻炼中，迅速地提高了自己的文化、科学技术水平，由一个普通的农民，成为中国农业科学院陕西分院特约农民研究员了。
    王保京是否具备了上大学的条件？这是没有必要怀疑的。王保京曾经自修过农业高等学校的一部分课程，例如“土壤学”、“作物栽培学”里的小麦、玉米栽培技术，“耕作学”里的马尔采福耕作方法等等书籍。他能写自己的讲话提纲。在实践当中他获得了令人惊讶的各种成就，和社员一起搞了一百六十二个农业科学研究项目，先后用有性杂交和无性杂交等办法，选育了十五个新品种；研究出一套适合当地栽培的玉米丰产技术经验，使得玉米亩产量由原来的二、三百斤提高到一千三、一千五、一千七、二千一百多斤；还成功地进行了利用阳光的试验——宽行间作套种的耕作方法，给防止小麦倒伏和减少棉花落蕾提供了丰富而宝贵的资料……。
    王保京文化科学技术水平的提高，完全是在日常的实践中获得的。解放初期，他第一次听到农业技术推广站技术员谈到了人工授粉、灌溉、施肥和防虫等科学知识后，感到新奇。从此，他就开始进入自己的“田间大学”了。他在参观、访问中，从许多次的会议中，从许多领导同志和科学技术人员那里，从自己的田间试验研究中，日积月累地学到许多东西。给他印象最深的，是这样两件事：一次是他去苏联参观，在莫斯科时农业科学家李森科接见了他。他请教李森科怎样搞科学研究。李森科意味深长地说：“科学是那里来的？……科学是人在实践中创造出来的。”另一次是有人在背后嘀嘀咕咕地说他搞的研究不是方向。正在那时候，中共陕西省委第一书记张德生到他们农业社去视察，向他说：
  “很对啊！就这么搞。干就是学，农民一定要研究科学。”他受到了很大的鼓舞，他牢牢记住这些话。他干，他学，自己的文化水平和科学技术水平迅速的提高了。
    但是王保京还觉得不够，他作出了许多成就，还不能从科学上得到说明。他觉得不仅要达到某种成就，而且还要知道是为什么？“要是能上西北农学院学习一些基础理论知识该多美！”近两年来，他的头脑中不断出现着这念头。现在，他的愿望达到了，中共陕西省委决定送他到西北农学院去深造。
    9日上午，王保京上了大学的第一课——“植物学”。讲授的是农学系讲师张智敏。她曾经在王保京所在的烽火生产队劳动锻炼过，在那里向王保京学习了很多实际的生产经验。现在，她要给王保京讲解理论知识了，怎么能不特别感到高兴呢。现在，王保京端端正正地坐在农学系的教室里。他穿的那件普通农民的黑棉袄上，挂着“西北农学院”的校徽。他聚精会神的听讲，用心的作着笔记。下课以后，当别人问他听的怎样时，他握紧拳头，向自己的腿上一顿，充满自信说：“没问题，能懂。我还要保证开门红，学好第一天的课程，到晚上向校党委报喜；学好整个的课程，向党、向毛主席献礼呢！
