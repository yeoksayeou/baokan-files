    Three Young Men

    The factory director's office is right next to the workshop,
    You can hear the window panes rattling all day long.
    The old soldier's ears are well-trained,
    If the rattling is urgent, it surely means production
    is in a mess! Suddenly the door slams open with a bang,
    And in come three young men.
    One holds a red paper in his hand,
    Covered in grease and with sweat streaming down his face.
    "There's a dance at the club today,
    Young men, hurry up and wash, change, and get dressed!
    You were already notified about the three-day Spring Festival holiday,
    So there's no need to write a leave request."
    Two mischievous fellows doubled over with laughter,
    But the third was so anxious his nose was smoking:
    "Please, Factory Director, approve us working overtime,
    To make this experiment a success to greet the spring!"
    "You still need to follow the regulations,
    Save your energy for after the holiday."
    "A Great Leap Forward day is like twenty years,
    After the Spring Festival, we'll have new plans!"
    The factory director looked closely at the three red papers,
    Filled with rationalization proposals.
    He smiled, shook his head, and said helplessly:
    "When the bell rings, leave the workshop immediately!"
    On the morning of the Spring Festival, before dawn,
    The factory director opened the door to a welcoming good news bulletin;
    This bulletin was quite rare,
    Signed: Three Young Men.
    "We succeeded in the new experiment last night,
    Which can save the country a great deal of money:
    Roughly estimated at 280,000 yuan per year,
    A careful calculation might exceed 300,000... "
    The factory director smiled as he read the good news,
    Took it and posted it on the Great Leap Forward bulletin board.
    When work started, everyone passed by it,
    Happily spreading this news of victory...

    三个小青年
    陈实
    厂长办公室紧挨着车间，
    只听玻璃窗整天价打颤。
    老兵的耳朵有锻炼，
    颤声急，准是生产
    闹翻天！忽然门儿光当一响，
    进来三个小青年。
    一人手拿一张红纸，
    满身油垢脸上还直淌汗。
    “今天俱乐部里有舞会，
    小伙子们还不快洗换打扮！
    早通知春节放三天假，
    就不必再写来请假单。”
    两个调皮鬼直把腰笑弯，
    第三个却急得鼻子冒烟：
    “请厂长批准我们加个班，
    搞成功这个试验迎接春天！”
    “你们还是按规定办，
    有劲留到节后施展。”
    “大跃进一天等于二十年，
    过了春节咱们还有新打算！”
    厂长把三张红纸细细看，
    合理化建议写满纸面。
    他笑着摇摇头没奈何说：
    “钟声一响，马上离车间！”
    春节早晨天还不亮，
    厂长开门喜报迎面；
    这张喜报可太稀罕，
    署名是：三个小青年。
    “我们昨晚搞成新试验，
    能给国家节约大笔钱：
    毛估每年二十八万元，
    细算恐得超过三十万。……”
    厂长笑着把喜报念，
    接过来贴上跃进栏。
    开工时大伙从这儿过，
    乐乐呵呵把这捷音传……
