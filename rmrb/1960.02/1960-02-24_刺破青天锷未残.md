	The Sword that Pierced the Azure Sky Remains Sharp
	Meiyuan

	In the great campaign for mechanization, a group of small factories in Chongqing, without a single machine or an inch of steel, leaped forward and mounted the steed of mechanization; 50% of the city's youth engaged in manual labor have been liberated from heavy labor and become masters of machines. From the vigor of this one city, we can also see that a high tide of technical innovation and technical revolution, extremely rapid and magnificent in scale, is sweeping across our country's industrial front, rushing down a thousand miles with tremendous force. It has swept across all regions and industries. In the movement, innovation pioneers have sprung up like clouds, and innovation flowers have bloomed all over the land. It has made a good start for the sustained leap forward throughout our 1960s.

	In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the workers have a saying: "Beyond the mountains are more mountains, beyond the sky is more sky." This saying is correct and well said! Our revolutionary and construction undertakings are like a long march. With the completion of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule and the realization of two consecutive years of Great Leap Forward, we have climbed a new peak on the road of construction ahead of time. But for communists, this is only reaching a peak midway, and a better future is still far ahead. After climbing one peak, we must climb higher peaks; after climbing higher peaks, we must ascend to the heavens; after ascending one heaven, we must ascend two heavens, and so on up to the ninth heaven. Beyond the mountains are more mountains, beyond the sky is more sky, and we continue to advance and advance again.

	The completion of the democratic revolution and the basic completion of the socialist revolution have liberated the people's productive forces from the shackles of the old relations of production. However, our production technology is still backward, and the vast majority of farmers and more than 50% of workers are engaged in heavy manual labor, not fully becoming masters of machines and nature. How to get rid of this state of "slavery"? The working people say it well: "Hard work can climb mountains, clever work can ascend to the heavens." "Clever work" here refers to technical innovation and technical revolution. The "heaven" referred to here is not the "Western Paradise" in mythological novels, but to transform the real earth and nature into a communist paradise on earth. Under the illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, our working class not only has the lofty ideal of building socialism-communism, but also firmly believes that as long as we exert full effort, dare to think and dare to act, and carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, we can ascend to the heavens. What is so difficult about ascending to the heavens! Birds can ascend to the heavens, and our airplanes have also ascended to the heavens; how far away is Chang'e in the Moon Palace, but the Soviet rockets have not gone to visit her! The continuous development of production technology and the realization of a high degree of modernization will give us more material power to build a communist paradise.

	Doesn't Wei Gaohou, a young milling worker at the Chongqing Chang'an Machine Factory, have a famous saying? "Achievements are always not enough!" Wei Gaohou, Su Guangming, Ma Xueli, Ma Wanshui, and thousands of other advanced producers have not remained in place, but have continued to make new achievements. The Chinese working class, armed with the spirit of continuous revolution, has the firm perseverance to build socialism, and no difficulty can stop their giant steps forward. Qi Jinsheng, a young worker at the Harbin Boiler Factory with only a junior high school education, after more than a thousand days and nights of hard study and research, successfully created an automatic control instrument for machine tool programs, conquering a cutting-edge technology. The vigorous technical innovation movement is just in full swing, and the future is long!

	This reminds us of a line from Chairman Mao's "Sixteen-Character Poem" written during the Long March: "The sword that pierced the azure sky remains sharp." The soaring ambition of our working class stands as majestic as a high mountain, towering into the clouds! Our technical innovation movement to climb the peaks of science and technology is like a long sword piercing the azure sky! It promotes leap forward in production and enables us to achieve significant achievements. But our "sword's edge" will never have any defects. The working class with the spirit of continuous revolution will continue to rely on it to stab towards the high ninth heaven!

    刺破青天锷未残
    梅原
    在大闹机械化的运动里，重庆有一批没有一部机器、没有一寸钢材的小厂，一步登天，跨上了机械化的骏马；全市从事手工操作的青年，已有50％从笨重劳动中解放出来，作了机器的主人。从这一个城市的劲头，我们也能看到：一个其势极其迅猛、规模极其壮阔的技术革新和技术革命运动的高潮，正在我国工业战线上，一泻千里，汹涌澎湃。它席卷了各地、各行业。在运动中，革新闯将风起云涌，革新花朵开满大地。它给我们整个六十年代的持续跃进，作了良好的开端。
    在技术革新和技术革命运动中，工人们有句话：“山外青山天外天”。这句话说得对，说得好！我们从事革命和建设事业，好像进行长途行军。第二个五年计划提前三年完成，连续两年大跃进的实现，我们在建设的征程上，提前登上了一座新的高峰。但，这对于共产主义者来说，只不过到达了中途的一个山峰而已，美好前景还远在前方。登上了一座山峰，还要攀登更高的山峰；登上了更高的山峰，还要上天；上了一重天，还要上二重天，以至九重天。山外有山，天外有天，我们不断地前进再前进。
    民主主义革命的完成和社会主义革命的基本完成，人民生产力冲破旧的生产关系的桎梏，获得了解放。可是我们的生产技术还很落后，广大农民和50％以上的工人，从事着笨重的手工劳动，没有充分地成为机器和自然界的主人。怎样摆脱这种“奴隶”状态？劳动人民说得好：“苦干能上山，巧干能上天。”这里的“巧干”就是指的技术革新和技术革命。这里指的“天”，不是神话小说中的“西方极乐世界”，而是要把现实中的地球和自然界，改造成为人间的共产主义天堂。在毛泽东思想照耀下，我国工人阶级不仅有着建立社会主义—共产主义的远大理想，而且深信：只要我们鼓足干劲，敢想敢干，开展技术革新和技术革命运动，是能够上天的。上天有什么难！鸟能上天，我们的飞机也上了天；月宫嫦娥离我们何等遥远，苏联火箭，还不是去拜访了她！生产技术的不断发展，实现了高度的现代化，我们就掌握更多的建设共产主义天堂的物质力量。
    重庆长安机器厂青年铣工魏高厚不是有一句名言吗？“成绩总是不够的！”魏高厚、苏广铭、马学礼、马万水以及千千万万个先进生产者，都没有停留在原地踏步，而是不断地作出新的成绩。以不断革命精神武装了思想的我国工人阶级，有着建设社会主义的坚强毅力，什么困难也休想阻挡他们向前迈进的巨步。哈尔滨锅炉厂青工、只有高小文化程度的齐金生，经过一千多个日日夜夜的苦学苦钻，创造成功机床程序自动控制仪，攻下了一项尖端技术。轰轰烈烈的技术革新运动正在方兴未艾，来日方长哩！
    这使我们想起毛主席在长征途中写的“十六字令”里的一句：“刺破青天锷未残”。我们工人阶级的凌云壮志，正像高山那样巍然屹立，矗入云霄！我们攀登科学技术高峰的技术革新运动，正像刺破青天的长剑！它推动生产飞跃地前进，使我们取得了重大的成就。但我们的“剑锋”，从不会有任何残缺。具有不断革命精神的工人阶级，还要依靠它继续刺向高高的九重天！
