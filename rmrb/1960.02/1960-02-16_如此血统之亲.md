Such Kinship of Blood

The United States, in order to expand into Africa, has spoken countless sweet words. Recently, they have come up with the novel idea of talking about the so-called blood relationship between the United States and Africa.

At the recently concluded United Nations Economic Commission for Africa meeting, the American observer Phillips openly demanded that "African development" be based on "the same principles of freedom as the United States," and even said that the United States was "particularly concerned about Africa" because "one in ten Americans is of African descent (referring to the 17 million black people in the United States)." But the fact that the United States and Africa have a blood relationship is by no means a new discovery by Phillips. At the end of last year, the US representative to the United Nations, Lodge, also said that the reason why the United States "particularly welcomed" more African countries to join the United Nations was because the United States was "the country with the largest number of African black descendants besides Nigeria." Whether it is Lodge or Phillips, they simply want Africans to see the United States as their closest relatives, as one family. Since we are one family, we can be unreserved, and "what's yours is mine." That's all.

However, it is very rare that American white gentlemen with a high sense of racial superiority are willing to be related to the black people they have always looked down upon. However, when they talk about their close relationship with African blacks, why don't they dare to talk about the plight of American blacks who are subjected to discrimination and persecution? In particular, if it is pointed out that in the United States, some people have created the theory that black blood cannot be transfused to white people, and some states in the United States even expressly stipulate that plasma for blood transfusion should not be mixed between black and white people, then the Phillips' talk of the blood relationship between Americans and African blacks is a bit too self-deceiving.

Therefore, it seems that US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Satterthwaite is more self-aware. At the beginning of last year, when he was active in various parts of Africa, he also sold the same nostrum of "concern" and "welcome" to Africa as Phillips and Lodge, but he was relatively honest about the issue of racial discrimination and oppression in Africa. He said: "Given our domestic problems in racial equality, the United States should avoid trying to force any African territory to accept solutions to this problem." To put it simply: since there is racial discrimination in our own country, it is better to avoid talking about racial equality in Africa. Don't Phillips and Lodge think that their propaganda of the so-called blood relationship with Africa will make African blacks feel a new threat from the Ku Klux Klan?

### 如此血统之亲

    如此血统之亲
    美国为了向非洲扩张，不知说了多少动听的话。近来更别出心裁，大谈所谓美国同非洲的血统关系。
    在最近结束的联合国非洲经济委员会会议上，美国观察员菲利普斯公然要“非洲的发展”建立在同美国“同样的自由原则的基础上”，还说什么美国所以“对非洲特别关切”，是由于“每十个美国人中有一个人是非洲血统（指美国的一千七百万黑人）。”但美国同非洲居然存在血统之亲，这决不是菲利普斯的新发现，去年年底美国驻联合国代表洛奇为了表明美国为什么“特别欢迎”更多的非洲国家加入联合国时，也说是因为美国是“除了尼日利亚以外拥有最多的非洲黑人后裔的人民的国家”。不管洛奇也好，菲利普斯也好，都无非是想要非洲人把美国看作是他们的至亲，是一家人。既然是一家人，就大可不分彼此，“你的就是我的”。如此而已。
    但是，具有高度种族优越感的美国白种老爷居然肯于同他们素来瞧不起的黑种人攀亲戚，这倒是非常难得的。不过在他们大谈同非洲黑人的亲密关系时，为什么不敢谈一下美国黑人受尽歧视和迫害的境遇呢？特别是如果指出在美国已有人创立了黑人血液不能输给白人的理论，美国有些州甚至明文规定供输血用的血浆不得黑白种人混用等等事实，那末菲利普斯之流大谈什么美国人同非洲黑人的血统关系就未免过于自欺欺人了。
    因此，看来还是美国负责非洲事务助理国务卿萨脱斯威特有自知之明一些。去年初，他到非洲各地活动时，卖的也是菲利普斯和洛奇所谓对非洲的“关切”和“欢迎”之类的狗皮膏药，但他对非洲的种族歧视和压迫的问题却是比较老实的。他说：“鉴于我们本国在种族平等方面的内政问题，美国应该避免试图强使任何非洲领地接受这种问题的解决办法”。说得通俗一点就是：自己国内存在着种族歧视，就少在非洲侈谈种族平等为妙。难道菲利普斯和洛奇就不认为，他们宣传的所谓对非洲的血统之亲不会使非洲黑人反而感到三K党的新威胁么。
