Six Domestic Animals Throughout Yunnan
People used to say that pastures are found in the Tianshan Mountains, but now Tianshan spreads throughout Yunnan; at the foot of the Liangshan Mountains, cattle and sheep abound, and along the banks of the Red River, chickens and ducks are everywhere. Large, fat pigs burst out of their sties, and mules and horses make a racket in the fields and villages; bees dance gracefully before the flowers, and the scenery is fresh on the fruit-filled mountains. Silver rabbits want to climb to the moon in the sky, and steeds leap through the nine heavens; outstanding people and a rich land lead to thriving domestic animals, and grain production piles up like mountains.

    六畜遍云南
    洪海人道牧场数天山，如今天山遍云南；凉山麓下牛羊多，红河两岸鸡鸭全。大个肥猪挤破厩，田野乡村骡马喧；蜜蜂翩翩花前舞，花果山上春色鲜。银兔欲攀天边月，骏马登破九重天；人杰地灵六畜旺，粮食增产堆成山。
