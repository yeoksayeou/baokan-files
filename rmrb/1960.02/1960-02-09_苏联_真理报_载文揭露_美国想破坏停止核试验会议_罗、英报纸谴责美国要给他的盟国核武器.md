    Soviet "Truth" Article Exposes
    U.S. Attempt to Sabotage Nuclear Test Ban Conference
    Romanian and British Newspapers Condemn U.S. for Giving Nuclear Weapons to its Allies
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 5th. The Soviet newspaper "Truth" published an article today exposing the Western countries, particularly the U.S. ruling clique's, plot to sabotage the Soviet-American-British conference in Geneva on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing.
    The article said that the conference on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing has been going on for more than a year, and thanks to the continuous efforts of the Soviet Union, some progress has been made. However, recently, Western newspapers have been saying that the Geneva conference will soon completely collapse, and they are blaming the Soviet Union. These newspapers insist that the conference cannot proceed smoothly because the Soviet Union is unwilling to consider the "new" material from the United States regarding the use of seismic methods to detect underground nuclear explosions.
    "Truth" pointed out that this argument is actually just a smokescreen, the purpose of which is to cover up the U.S. plot to continue nuclear weapons testing. The article concluded by saying that recent U.S. actions are likely to bring the Geneva conference to a standstill. World public opinion is urgently demanding a halt to nuclear weapons testing.
    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, February 7th. The "Free Romania" newspaper published a commentary today condemning U.S. President Eisenhower's "Cold War" clamor. The commentary wrote that Eisenhower said at a recent press conference that the United States would supply nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons technical data to countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other aggressive blocs. The commentary said that this action is contrary to the peaceful aspirations of all peoples. This action means encouraging the Western bloc, which opposes easing international tensions and places its hopes on the bankrupt "Cold War" policy, to intensify its arms expansion. It also means that the United States will openly hand over nuclear weapons to the West German government, which does not recognize the current borders, is keen on expanding its armaments, and has notorious Nazis participating, as well as to the South Korean and South Vietnamese authorities. These actions are a great danger to the cause of peace.
    The commentary pointed out that the U.S. attempt to supply nuclear weapons to other countries casts doubt on the U.S. sincerity at the upcoming Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference, especially at the summit conference of government leaders. The U.S. position has been strongly protested by world public opinion.
    Xinhua News Agency, London, February 5th. The "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the 5th saying that Eisenhower has had a nuclear bomb-like destructive effect on efforts to ease international tensions and disarm.
    The editorial continued, he (at a press conference on the 3rd) proposed that the United States supply its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies with nuclear weapons and that they could have complete control over these weapons. The editorial said that nothing could be more deliberately unsettling than this proposal.
    This proposal was put forward on the eve of a new East-West disarmament conference with U.S. participation. Deciding at this moment to allow more countries to possess nuclear weapons means that there is a force in the United States that intends to disrupt the conference.
    The newspaper said that allowing Adenauer to have complete control of weapons with nuclear warheads that can reach not only Russia but also any part of Britain will make peace and security far more unreliable than ever before.

    苏联“真理报”载文揭露
    美国想破坏停止核试验会议
    罗、英报纸谴责美国要给他的盟国核武器
    新华社莫斯科5日电　苏联“真理报”今天发表文章，揭露西方国家、特别是美国统治集团企图破坏在日内瓦举行的苏、美、英三国不继续试验核武器会议的阴谋。
    文章说，不继续试验核武器会议已经进行了一年多，由于苏联不断的努力，会议取得了某些进展。但是，最近西方报刊上却出现了一种说什么日内瓦会议将很快彻底垮台的论调，并且把责任推到苏联身上。这些报刊硬说什么会议不能顺利进行是因为苏联不愿考虑美国关于以地震方法发现地下核爆炸的“新”材料。
    “真理报”指出，这种论调实际上不过是一种烟幕，其目的是为了掩盖美国想继续试验核武器的阴谋。文章最后说，美国最近的作法很可能使日内瓦会议陷入僵局。世界舆论都在迫切要求停止核武器试验。
    新华社布加勒斯特7日电　“自由罗马尼亚报”今天发表评论，谴责美国总统艾森豪威尔的“冷战”叫嚣。评论写道，艾森豪威尔在最近一次记者招待会上说，美国要把核武器和核武器技术资料供给北大西洋公约组织和其它侵略集团的国家。评论说，这种行动是和各国人民的和平愿望相违背的。这种行动意味着怂恿反对缓和国际紧张局势并把希望寄托在破了产的“冷战”政策的西方集团再加紧扩充军备，这也意味着美国将公开地把核武器交给不承认现在的国境线、热中于扩充军备并有臭名昭彰的纳粹分子参加的西德政府以及南朝鲜和南越当局。这些行动对和平事业是一个很大的危险。
    评论指出，美国企图把核武器供给其它国家，这就使人怀疑在即将举行的十国裁军会议上，特别是在政府首脑会议上美国的诚意。美国的这种立场遭到了世界舆论的强烈抗议。
    新华社伦敦5日电　“工人日报”5日发表社论说，艾森豪威尔对缓和国际紧张局势和裁军的努力起了核弹一般的破坏作用。
    社论接着说，他（3日在记者招待会上）建议以核武器供给美国的北大西洋公约组织盟国而且它们可以完全控制这种武器。社论说，没有什么东西比这个建议更蓄意引起最大不安的了。
    这个建议是在有美国参加的东西方新裁军会议的前夕提出的。在这个时刻决定让更多的国家拥有核武器，意味着在美国有一种企图破坏会议的势力。
    报纸说，让阿登纳完全控制不仅能到达俄国，而且能到达英国任何部分的带有核弹头的武器，将使和平与安全远比以往靠不住。
