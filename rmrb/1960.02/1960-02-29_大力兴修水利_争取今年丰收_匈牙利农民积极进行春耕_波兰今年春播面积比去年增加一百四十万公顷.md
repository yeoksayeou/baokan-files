Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, February 28th: With the rapid development of the cooperative movement, the production enthusiasm of agricultural laborers in Hungary is extremely high. At present, they are actively carrying out spring plowing and developing water conservancy projects to strive for a bumper harvest this year.

Since the beginning of spring, tractor drivers in many parts of the country have implemented a two-shift work system, constantly racing against time to carry out spring plowing. The repair work of the country's 32,000 tractors is about to be completed. Repair workers at the Tolna State Agricultural Machinery Station successfully completed the repair of agricultural machinery last winter. Since January, tractor drivers in this state have plowed 5,000 holds (each hold equals 0.57 hectares) of land. Agricultural production cooperatives in Solnok State have applied spring manure to 40,000 holds. While using modern machinery in production, all localities also pay attention to fully utilizing existing animal power and simple tools in order to accelerate the completion of spring plowing and sowing.

Cooperatives and state farms in various places have generally formulated plans to increase production and practice economy. Many states have launched labor competitions to strive for an average of 3,000 kilograms of corn per hold.

Farmers in various places are striving to fulfill the state's task of increasing animal husbandry by 7.2% this year.

The Komarom State cooperative proposed to raise twice as many fattened pigs as last year and also double the supply of fattened pigs to the state.

In order to solve the problem of feeding publicly owned livestock, many cooperative villages and towns have established construction teams to build livestock sheds using their own strength. Members of agricultural cooperatives in various places are also enthusiastically accumulating funds and purchasing agricultural machinery on their own. This spring, agricultural cooperatives across the country will purchase 3,000 tractors on their own.

The enthusiasm of agricultural cooperative members in various places for building water conservancy projects is very high. Solnok State, which has already made great achievements in irrigation in previous years, will continue to complete 17,000 holds of water conservancy irrigation work this spring.

In terms of building water conservancy irrigation, in addition to using modern irrigation methods such as underground water pipes, sprinklers, and artificial rain, the main focus is on vigorously developing underground water irrigation methods using "simple wells" and "tube wells," as well as the most economical traditional surface water diversion irrigation method. While using modern technology in repairing canals and tidying up land, traditional tools such as iron shovels, hoes, and wheelbarrows are also fully utilized. Agricultural cooperatives and state farms in various places will also complete soil improvement work on 100,000 holds of land this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, February 28th: From the fields of the Oder River to the Carpathian Mountains, Polish farmers have begun spring sowing and seedling replenishment work on the land soaked in snowmelt. This year's spring sowing area will be approximately 1.4 million hectares more than last year.

In order to strive for a good harvest this year, agricultural production cooperatives, agricultural teams, and individual farmers throughout the country have carried out seed selection, fertilizer accumulation, and agricultural tool repair work ahead of schedule. The state's agricultural departments have prepared 250,000 tons more of improved varieties than last year to support farmers in spring sowing. Currently, 30% of wheat seeds and 40% of barley seeds have been distributed to farmers or retail stations.

The state has also imported nearly 10,000 tons of corn and bean seeds to meet farmers' needs to expand the planting area of ​​feed crops.

Now, farmers are working hard, and the spring sowing work will be basically completed by mid-March.

    大力兴修水利  争取今年丰收
    匈牙利农民积极进行春耕
    波兰今年春播面积比去年增加一百四十万公顷
    新华社布达佩斯28日电　随着合作化运动的飞快发展，匈牙利各地农业劳动者的生产热情异常高涨，目前他们正在积极进行春耕、展开兴修水利等工作，争取今年大丰收。
    开春以来，全国许多地区的拖拉机手们便实行了两班工作制，不停地争取时间进行春耕。全国三万二千台拖拉机的检修工作即将全部结束。托尔那州农业机器站的修配工人去年冬季就胜利结束了农业机器的检修工作。从1月份开始，这个州的拖拉机手们已经耕了五千霍尔特（每霍尔特合零点五七公顷）的土地。索尔诺克州的农业生产合作社已经为四万霍尔特施了春季圈肥。在生产中利用现代化机器的同时，各地也注意充分利用现有的畜力和简单工具，以便加速完成春耕、春播工作。
    各地的合作社和国营农场都普遍制定了增产节约计划。许多州已经为争取每霍尔特玉米平均达到三千公斤而展开了劳动竞赛。
    各地农民们在为完成国家提出的今年使畜牧业提高7．2％的任务而奋斗。
    科马罗姆州的合作社就提出今年要比去年多养一倍的肥猪的保证，供给国家的肥猪也要增加一倍。
    为了解决公有牲畜的饲养问题，许多合作化的村镇成立了建筑队，用自己的力量来建筑牲畜棚舍。各地的农业合作社社员还踊跃积累资金，自力购买农业机器。今春全国农业合作社依靠自身的力量购买的拖拉机就将有三千台。
    各地农业合作社社员兴修水利的劲头很大。往年在灌溉方面已经取得很大成就的索尔诺克州，今春将继续完成一万七千霍尔特水利灌溉工作。
    各地在兴修水利灌溉方面，除了利用地下水管、喷头和人工造雨等现代化的灌溉方式外，主要是大搞“简易井”和“管井”的地下水灌溉方法，以及最节省的传统性的地面引水灌溉法。在修水渠和整理土地中，在使用现代化技术的同时，也充分利用传统工具——铁铲、镐和手推车等。各地农业合作社和国营农场今年还将完成十万霍尔特土地的土壤改良工作。
    新华社华沙28日电　从奥得河到喀尔巴阡山的田野上，波兰广大农民开始在浸润着雪水的土地上进行春播、补苗工作。今年春播面积约比去年多一百四十万公顷。
    为了争取今年丰收，全国各地的农业生产合作社、农业小组、个体农民提早进行了选种、积肥和修理农具的工作。国家的农业部门为了支援农民春播，比去年多准备了二十五万吨良种。目前已把30％的小麦种和40％的大麦种分配给农民或零售站。
    国家还进口了近万吨的玉米和豆类种子，以满足农民扩大饲料作物的种植面积的需要。
    现在，农民都在紧张地劳动，3月中旬，春播工作即可基本结束。
