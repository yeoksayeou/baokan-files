Double-cropping Rice is Double Happiness Rice
　　Go All Out for High Yields
　　Liang Chuanlu, Secretary of the CPC Wujiang County Committee, Jiangsu

　　Wujiang County has 920,000 mu of paddy fields, and is a low-lying water network area in the Suzhou Special District. The climate is mild, the frost-free period is long, the water source is abundant, and the masses have the habit of planting double-cropping rice. In 1959, through the hard work of the whole party and the entire people, we achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of large-scale double-cropping rice. The 157,000 mu of double-cropping rice in the county yielded 510 jin per mu in the first season and 703 jin per mu in the second season, with a total yield of 1,213 jin per mu for both seasons. This was an increase of 57.6% compared to 1958, and exceeded the per mu yield of the single-season late rice in 1959 by 30.1%.

　　Second Season Surpasses First Season - Double Harvests for Both Seasons

　　The characteristics of the 1959 double-cropping rice harvest were threefold: First, the first season was a bumper harvest, and the second season was an even greater bumper harvest, creating the miracle of "double harvests for both seasons, one year equals two years." In the past few years of planting double-cropping rice, the yield of the second season rice has always been lower than that of the first season. In 1959, the yield of the second season rice not only caught up with the first season rice, but also increased by 29% compared to the first season, catching up with the yield of the single-season rice in 1958, and jumping 1.55 times higher than the single yield of the second season rice in 1958. Second, the area of the first season was expanded, and every mu was planted in the second season, greatly increasing the total output. In 1959, the county planted 157,000 mu of double-cropping rice, an increase of 51.8% compared to 1958, and the total output increased by 139.8% compared to 1958. Third, there were overall bumper harvests and increases everywhere. The situation in 1959 was: high-yield areas had even higher yields, low-yield areas doubled their yields, areas with small acreage increased production, and areas with large acreage increased production even more. Both the first season rice and the second season rice saw a large number of fields yielding over 1,000 jin, and the second season rice also saw communes yielding over 800 jin and production brigades and teams yielding over 1,000 jin. This achievement fully proves that the Party's General Line is correct and great, and the people's communes are incomparably powerful. It further established the prestige of double-cropping rice, greatly liberated people's thinking, and inspired people to continue to realize the grand ambition of a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960. The masses generally reflected: Double-cropping rice is double happiness rice, one year's harvest is equivalent to two years' harvest.

　　Ideological Harvest is the Prerequisite for Grain Harvest

　　Large-scale planting of double-cropping rice is a reform of the production system, and also a change in the thinking and habits of the masses. In the process of striving for a bumper harvest of large-scale double-cropping rice, the struggle between advanced and backward ideas is very fierce. We have always held high the red flag of the General Line and adhered to putting politics in command, thus winning a great bumper harvest of double-cropping rice.

　　The first question we encountered was: Can double-cropping rice be planted on a large scale, and can large-scale planting achieve high yields? The facts of successive bumper harvests of double-cropping rice over the years have made cadres and the masses see the potential for increasing production. However, the planting area in 1959 was to be expanded by 51.8% compared to 1958. Some people had great concerns about whether both seasons could be guaranteed to increase production, and a few people even openly opposed it. They had "three difficulties and seven fears" about expanding the area of double-cropping rice. The "three difficulties" were: difficulties in labor, seeds, and fertilizer; the "seven fears" were: fear of high costs, fear of labor shortage, fear of lack of experience and poor planting, fear of unreliable yields in the second season, fear of late harvesting and planting, fear of out-of-season transplanting in the second season, and fear that the weather would not cooperate and no grain would be harvested. In response to these ideas, we used the facts of high yields obtained by expanding planting areas in various places over the years to calculate the increase in production, and specifically analyzed the subjective and objective conditions for large-scale planting of double-cropping rice, as well as the relationship between expanding the area of double-cropping rice and the continued great leap forward in agricultural production in 1959. Through discussion, it was unanimously reflected that planting double-cropping rice has four major benefits: First, there is confidence in increasing production, which is beneficial to national construction; second, it can be harvested early, which can provide a large amount of funds to increase the repair of agricultural tools and buy fertilizers, promoting late rice production; third, it can increase food rations in July and August; fourth, it increases feed (double-cropping rice straw is good feed for cattle). After repeated discussions, the planting area was determined from the bottom up, and the county expanded from more than 100,000 mu in 1958 to 157,000 mu.

　　When it came to planting double-cropping rice, there was another dispute over whether to plant "continuous double-cropping rice" or "intercropping green manure" (intercropping double-cropping rice). The reasons for emphasizing planting "intercropping green manure" were: first, the yield of the second season of "intercropping green manure" is reliable, while the yield of the second season of continuous cropping is difficult to guarantee; second, planting "intercropping green manure" saves labor and can reduce the pressure of harvesting and planting double-cropping rice; third, it can reduce the hardship of planting in the hot summer. These reasons are essentially a reflection of a lazy man's mentality of being afraid of hardship and wanting to save effort. We presented the facts that the per mu yield of continuous double-cropping rice has exceeded that of "intercropping green manure" in previous years, and criticized these erroneous arguments. The great harvest of double-cropping rice in 1959 further confirmed that "intercropping green manure" does not yield as much as continuous cropping.

　　During the rush planting of the second season rice, the county party committee analyzed the favorable situation of early maturity in the first season and early planting in the second season in 1959, and timely put forward the fighting slogan of "the second season catches up with the first season, the second season surpasses the first season." This slogan greatly inspired the determination and confidence of cadres and the masses to strive for a bumper harvest of the second season rice. However, could the second season really catch up with and surpass the first season? Some cadres and the masses were skeptical, believing that the second season could only "catch up" with the first season, but not "surpass" it. The essence of their thinking was "catch up as much as possible." There were also a small number of cadres and the masses who believed: "The second season rice has always been low-yielding, and it is difficult to surpass the first season." Some people even said: "The second season rice depends on the weather, good weather can harvest rice, bad weather cannot harvest rice." Therefore, another debate unfolded. In this debate, various places analyzed the favorable conditions and presented high-yield facts, powerfully refuting the erroneous arguments such as "the second season rice depends on the weather" and "it is difficult to increase the yield of the second season rice," and strengthened the confidence and determination to "the second season catches up with the first season, the second season surpasses the first season."

　　Hold High the Red Flag of the People's Communes

　　Fully leveraging the superiority of the people's communes is an important guarantee for achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest of double-cropping rice. In 1959, the area of double-cropping rice was large, the task was heavy, and labor was tight. Due to the "large and public" superiority of the people's communes, various difficulties were overcome. The first was to ensure the expansion of the area and to seize the season. Although the area of double-cropping rice in 1959 was more than 50% larger than in 1958, thanks to the people's communes, the labor potential was fully tapped and efforts were concentrated to carry out shock work. As a result, the harvest and planting time for both seasons were advanced by seven days to half a month compared to previous years, ensuring early sowing, early growth, and early maturity, and winning high yields. Second, due to going all out and winning time, the operation was more refined, especially changing the past habit of not preparing the land, not applying fertilizer, and cultivating roughly for the second season late rice. Therefore, the second season rice in 1959 surpassed the first season, caught up with the single season, and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. Third, after the establishment of the people's communes, large-scale water conservancy construction was carried out, overcoming drought and ensuring the normal growth of double-cropping rice. In the first winter and spring after communization, the county developed more than 250,000 mu of mechanized and electrical irrigation area. In the face of a hundred-day drought, mechanized and electrical irrigation played a huge role, ensuring timely irrigation.

　　Launch a Mass Movement

　　Throughout the process of planting double-cropping rice, leaders at all levels earnestly improved their working methods, strengthened specific leadership, and launched a mass movement, ensuring a comprehensive bumper harvest of double-cropping rice.

　　The first is to grasp the "head" of the harvest to ensure early and sufficient planting. Experience over the years has proven that "three early" (early sowing, early transplanting, early growth) is not only an important key to the bumper harvest of the first season early rice, but also the foundation for the bumper harvest of the second season rice. As the old farmers reflected: "Double-cropping rice is seasonal rice, if you want it good, plant it early." In 1959, we tightly grasped the season, and implemented the spirit of "three early promote one early" when cultivating double-cropping early rice seedlings, preparing all the preparations for sowing ten days earlier than in 1958. The sowing of double-cropping early rice ended before March 25, seven days earlier than in 1958; the transplanting ended in early May, five days earlier than in 1958; management was strengthened in time after planting to promote early greening, early tillering, and early maturity. Therefore, the harvesting period of early rice in 1959 was about seven days earlier than in 1958, creating conditions for early planting and high yield of the second season rice. At the beginning of the second season rice transplanting, we adopted the method of harvesting and planting at the same time, planting one piece as it was harvested, and put forward the slogan of "seize time, every second counts, grasp quality, no link is missed, ensure the area, no land is left empty," mobilizing all commune members to rush to harvest and plant. Therefore, in the case of a relatively severe drought, the county's second season rice was fully completed before the end of July, about six days earlier than in previous years.

　　Second, establish a responsibility system and strengthen the management of double-cropping rice seedling fields and large fields in a timely manner. Various places put forward the slogans of "manage seedlings like managing a three-day-old child" and "people do not leave the grain, fields do not leave the people," and strengthened the management of seedling fields in a timely manner to ensure that every grain becomes a seedling, every plant becomes a seedling, the seedlings are thick and strong, and transplanting is done in a timely manner. The county organized 1,668 professional teams to strengthen the management of seedling fields. After transplanting, the slogan of "plant well, manage well, plant well, manage well, link by link tightly" was put forward, and the responsibility system of "four fixings" (fixed field, fixed measures, fixed quality, fixed time) to the team was universally implemented on the basis of three guarantees, so that everyone has responsibility, every piece of land is managed, and various measures to increase production are effectively implemented.

　　Third, cadres cultivate experimental fields, establish pacesetters at all levels, summarize experience in a timely manner, discover problems, and guide the overall situation. Cadres above the production brigade level, technicians, and old farmers throughout the county cultivated a total of 2,690 mu of double-cropping rice experimental fields. Pacesetters were seized at each production link, taking the lead and setting an example to drive the general fields to earnestly implement measures to increase production. According to the statistics of 174 mu of second season rice experimental fields cultivated by the county and commune party committees, the single yield was 18% higher than the average single yield of the county, and the yield of the pacesetter fields was also higher than that of the general fields.

　　Fourth, carry out red flag competitions, organize inspections and acceptances, hold on-site meetings, and continuously promote seedling growth. For example, when double-cropping early rice was fully transplanted, the county established 1,824 inspection and acceptance teams, organized the masses to conduct self-inspection and mutual inspection, and adhered to specifications and quality. At the same time, various communes and production brigades also seized the advanced and held 254 on-site meetings in a timely manner, solving many specific problems.

　　Fifth, organize large-scale cooperation to effectively solve the difficulties of insufficient labor, tools, and seedlings in some production teams.

　　Technical Reform Blossoms

　　Vigorously carrying out the technical reform movement and comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture is another important reason for the large-scale increase in double-cropping rice production.

　　First, select superior varieties and cultivate strong seedlings in advance. In 1959, the county selected superior varieties for more than 95% of the area, and carefully cultivated seedlings. Experience has proven that, regardless of paddy field or dry land seedling cultivation, the time of seed sowing should be determined according to the different growth periods of various varieties, and late japonica varieties should be sown earlier.

　　Second, implement various measures to increase production centered on close planting, and earnestly achieve fine land preparation and reasonable close planting. At present, it seems that a density of about 50,000 holes for the first crop of rice is more reasonable, and about 40,000 holes for the second season of late rice is better.

　　Third, apply sufficient base fertilizer and seize the opportunity to topdress. Regardless of base fertilizer or topdressing, try to choose quick-acting fertilizers to ensure "one baking head" and long-lasting fertility to promote early growth and early maturity.

　　Fourth, strengthen field management, timely cultivate seedlings, weed, and bake the fields, and thoroughly overcome diseases and insect pests. In 1959, the cultivation and weeding of double-cropping rice were generally done in a timely manner. After the seedlings survived, topdressing was applied once and processing was done once, and after a week, topdressing was applied twice and processing was done twice to ensure that every piece of land was loose and free of weeds.

　　Although we achieved a bumper harvest of double-cropping rice in 1959, it is still not enough compared to advanced regions. We are determined to make persistent efforts, go all out, and hold the high-yield red flag of double-cropping rice even higher in 1960.

    双季稻是双喜稻
    鼓足干劲产量高
    中共江苏吴江县委书记　梁传禄
    吴江县共有水稻田九十二万亩，是苏州专区比较低洼的水网圩区。气候温和，无霜期长，水源充沛，群众有种植双季稻习惯。1959年，经过全党全民的辛勤劳动，获得了大面积双季稻的空前大丰收。全县十五万七千亩双季稻，前季亩产五百一十斤，后季亩产七百零三斤，两季亩产合计一千二百十三斤，比1958年增加57．6％，超过1959年单季晚稻亩产量的30．1％。
    后季超前季　双季双丰收
    1959年双季稻丰收的特点有三：一是前季丰收，后季更大丰收，出现了“双季双丰收，一年抵二年”的奇迹。种植双季稻几年来的经验，后季稻产量总赶不上前季稻。1959年，后季稻的产量不仅赶上前季稻，而且比前季稻增产29％，赶上了1958年单季稻的产量，比1958年后季稻单产猛跳了一点五五倍。二是前季面积扩大，后季亩亩种上，总产量大大提高。全县1959年种植双季稻十五万七千亩，比1958年扩大面积51．8％，总产量比1958年增加139．8％。三是全面丰收，到处增产。1959年的情况是：高产地区更高产，低产地区成倍翻，面积少的增产，面积多的更增产。前季稻和后季稻都出现了大批千斤田，后季稻还出现了八百斤以上的公社和千斤以上的大队、小队。这个丰收成绩，充分证明了党的总路线正确伟大，人民公社威力无比，进一步树立双季稻的威信，大大解放了人们的思想，鼓舞了人们继续实现1960年更大更好更全面跃进的雄心大志。群众普遍反映：双季稻，双喜稻，一年收了二年粮。
    思想丰收是粮食丰收的前提
    大面积种植双季稻是生产制度的改革，也是群众思想和习惯的改变。在争取大面积双季稻丰收的过程中，先进与落后两种思想的斗争是非常激烈的。我们始终高举总路线红旗，坚持政治挂帅，从而争得了双季稻的大丰收。
    首先遇到的问题是：双季稻能不能大面积种植，大面积种植能不能高产？几年来，双季稻连年丰收的事实，已经使干部和群众看到双季稻增产的潜力。但是1959年要比1958年扩大51．8％的种植面积，扩大了面积，能不能保证两季都增产，一些人顾虑很大，少数人甚至公开反对。他们对扩大双季稻面积有“三难七怕”。“三难”即：劳力、种子、肥料困难；“七怕”即：怕成本大、怕劳力缺、怕没有经验种不好、怕后季产量靠不住、怕抢收抢种晚、怕后季移栽过季节、怕天不帮忙收不到粮。针对这些思想，我们运用了各地几年来扩大种植面积获得高产的事实，算增产账，具体分析了大面积种植双季稻的主客观条件，以及扩大双季稻面积同1959年农业生产继续大跃进的关系。通过讨论，一致反映种植双季稻有四大好处：一是增产有把握，对国家建设有利；二是收得早，可以有大批资金增修农具和买肥料，促进晚稻生产；三是可以在7、8月间增加一笔口粮；四是增加了饲料（双季稻草是耕牛的好饲料）。经过反复的讨论，自下而上的把种植面积定了下来，全县由1958年十万多亩扩大到十五万七千亩。
    到双季稻种植时，又出现了多种“连作双季稻”还是多种“嵌青”（间作双季稻）的争执。强调多种“嵌青”的理由：一是“嵌青”的后季产量靠得住，连作后季产量难保证；二是种“嵌青”省劳力，可以减轻双季稻抢收抢种时的压力；三是可以少吃在炎夏抢种的苦。这些理由实质上是一种怕吃苦、贪省力的懒汉思想的反映。我们摆出了历年来连作双季稻亩产超过“嵌青”的事实，批判了这些错误论调。1959年双季连作稻的大丰收，就进一步证实了“嵌青”不及连作收得多。
    在后季稻抢种的时候，县委分析1959年前季早熟、后季早种的有利情况，及时提出“后季赶前季，后季超前季”的战斗口号。这个口号，大大鼓舞了干部群众争取后季稻大丰收的决心和信心。但是，后季究竟能不能赶上前季，超过前季呢？有一部分干部和群众却将信将疑，认为后季只能“赶”前季，不能“超”前季。其思想实质是“能赶多少是多少”。还有少数干部和群众认为：“后季稻历年是低产，要想超过前季难上难”。有的人还说：“后季稻是靠天稻，天气好能收稻，天气不好收不到”。因此，一场论战又展开了。在这场论战中，各地通过分析有利条件，摆高产事实，有力地驳斥了“后季稻是靠天稻”，“后季稻难增产”等等错误论调，坚定了“后季赶前季，后季超前季”的信心和决心。
    高举人民公社红旗
    充分发挥人民公社的优越性，是争取双季稻空前大丰收的重要保证。1959年双季稻面积大、任务重、劳力紧张，由于人民公社发挥了“一大二公”的优越性，克服了各种困难。首先是保证了扩大面积，抢上了季节。1959年双季稻的面积虽然比1958年扩大50％以上，由于有了人民公社，充分挖掘了劳动潜力，集中力量进行突击，因而使两季的收种时间都比往年提前了七天到半个月，保证了早播、早发、早熟，夺得高产。其次，由于鼓足了干劲，赢得了时间，操作更加精细，特别是改变了过去后季晚稻不整田、不施肥、耕作粗放的习惯。因而1959年的后季稻超过了前季，赶上了单季，获得了历年来未有的大丰收。再次，人民公社成立后大搞了水利建设，战胜了干旱，保证了双季稻正常生长。公社化后第一个冬春，全县就发展了二十五万多亩机电灌溉面积，在百日大旱的情况下，机电灌溉发挥了巨大作用，保证了适时灌溉。
    大搞群众运动
    在种植双季稻的整个过程中，各级领导切实地改进工作方法，加强具体领导，大搞群众运动，确保了双季稻的全面大丰收。
  首先是抓丰收的“头”，保证种得早、种得足。几年来的经验证明：“三早”（早播、早插、早发），不但是前季早稻丰收的重要关键，也是后季稻丰收的基础。正如老农反映的：“双季稻，季节稻，若要好，种得早。”1959年我们紧紧抓住了季节这一关，在培育双季早稻秧苗时就贯彻了“三早促一早”的精神，比1958年提前十天做好了播种前的一切准备工作。双季早稻播种在3月25日前结束，比1958年提前七天；移栽在5月初结束，比1958年提前五天；种后及时加强管理，促使早转青、早发棵、早成熟。因此，1959年早稻收割期比1958年提前七天左右，为后季稻早栽高产创造了条件。后季稻移栽开始，我们采取了边收边种，收一块种一块的办法，提出了“抢时间，分秒必争，抓质量，一环不漏，保面积，分地不空”的口号，动员全体社员抢收抢种，因而在旱情比较严重的情况下，全县后季稻在7月底前全面结束，比往年提前六天左右。
    第二，建立责任制度，及时加强双季稻秧田和大田的管理。各地都提出“管秧如管三朝儿”“人不离谷，田不离人”的口号，及时加强秧田管理。保证粒粒成苗，株株成秧，苗粗苗壮，适时插秧。全县组织了一千六百六十八个专业组，加强秧田管理。插秧以后又提出了“栽好一块管好一块，栽好管好，环环扣牢”的口号，全县组织二千九百六十九个田间管理专业队，在三包的基础上普遍推行“四定”（定田、定措施、定质量、定时间）到队的责任制度，做到人人有责任，块块有人管，确保各种增产措施切实地贯彻执行。
    第三，干部搞试验田，层层树立标兵，及时总结经验，发现问题，指导全面。全县生产大队以上干部和技术员、老农共搞了双季稻试验田二千六百九十亩。层层抓住标兵，在每个生产环节上都先行一步，做出样子，带动一般田认真地贯彻增产措施。据县和公社党委搞的一百七十四亩后季稻试验田的统计，单产比全县平均单产高18％，标兵田的产量也都高于一般田。
    第四，开展红旗竞赛，组织检查验收，召开现场会议，不断看苗促进。例如，双季早稻全面插秧时，全县成立检查验收组一千八百二十四个，组织群众自查互查，坚持规格质量。同时，各公社、大队并抓住先进，及时召开二百五十四次现场会议，解决了许多具体问题。
    第五，组织大协作，切实解决一部分生产队劳力、工具、秧苗不足的困难。
    技术改革开红花
    大力开展技术改革运动，全面贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”是双季稻大面积增产的又一个重要原因。
    第一，选择优良品种，提前育好肥壮秧苗。全县1959年选择优良品种面积达95％以上，并且认真地培育了秧苗。经验证明，不论水田、旱地育秧，都应根据各种品种不同的生长期而确定落谷时间，晚粳品种应该提前早播。
    第二，贯彻以密植为中心的各项增产措施，切实做到精细整地、合理密植。目前看来，前作稻五万穴左右的密度比较合理，后季晚稻以四万穴左右为好。
    第三，施足基肥，抓紧追肥。不论基肥、追肥都尽量注意选用速效肥料，保证做到“一烘头”和肥力长，促使早发、早熟。
    第四，加强田间管理，适时耘苗、除草、烤田，彻底战胜病虫灾害。1959年双季稻耘苗、除草，一般都做得比较及时，活棵后即追一次肥、加一次工，隔一星期又追二次肥、加二次工，做到块块田土松无杂草。
    虽然我们1959年双季稻获得了大丰收，但与先进地区比较起来还不够。我们决心再接再厉，大鼓干劲，在1960年把双季稻高产红旗举得更高。
