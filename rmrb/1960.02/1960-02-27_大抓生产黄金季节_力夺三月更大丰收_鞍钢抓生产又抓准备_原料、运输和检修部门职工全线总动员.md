Grasp the Golden Season of Production to Strive for a Greater Harvest in March
Angang Grasps Production and Prepares Simultaneously
Workers in Raw Materials, Transportation, and Repair Departments are Fully Mobilized

(Our Correspondent in Anshan, February 26th) While vigorously grasping current production, Anshan Iron and Steel Company is actively preparing in three aspects—raw materials, transportation, and equipment maintenance—to ensure continued leaps forward in production in March.

As production continues to increase, raw materials, transportation, and equipment maintenance must keep up. In response to this situation, the Angang Party Committee held several discussions and studies, and made decisions to strengthen work in raw materials, transportation, and equipment maintenance. All factories and mines have taken strengthening mining, transportation, and equipment maintenance as an important political task, and quickly launched a vigorous mass movement to grasp raw materials, transportation, and equipment maintenance. Currently, iron ore production has increased by 5.4% compared to the first ten days of the month, and iron concentrate has increased by 7.1%; the one-time operation time of freight cars has been shortened from 22.5 hours to 18 hours, and the number of vehicles retained has decreased by 17%; equipment in many factories and mines has been well maintained.

In terms of raw materials, the Angang Party Committee first strengthened its leadership over the production of iron ore and concentrate powder. On the one hand, it sent a Party Committee Secretary and a Deputy Manager to the main raw material bases to mobilize the masses to engage in large-scale technical innovation and technical revolution. On the other hand, it mobilized other factories to carry out communist cooperation. Workers at the Cherry Garden Iron Mine realized 191 major technical innovations in the first eleven days of February, completing the first half of the month's production plan three and a half days ahead of schedule, and the production level increased by 18.6% compared to December of last year. In the case of increased tasks at the Gongchangling Iron Mine, the lack of technical personnel and equipment made it impossible to repair ball mills in a timely manner, affecting the increase in ore production. After learning of this situation, the Sintering General Plant and the Northern Machinery Repair Plant immediately extracted more than 120 fitters, turners, and other workers and dozens of machine tools from their production posts to provide support, strengthening the mechanical maintenance force, reducing accidents, and ensuring the normal operation of machinery, so that the output of concentrate powder in the middle ten days of the month increased sharply by 24.8% compared with the first ten days. When the Dong Anshan Flotation Plant was attacking the filtration bottleneck, the Sintering General Plant, the Southern Machinery Repair Plant, the Electrical Repair Plant, the Jieshui Plant, and the Angang Machinery Department and Power Department and other ten units, extracted more than 30 experienced veteran workers, innovation experts, engineering technicians and management cadres, jointly formed a communist collaboration team to help, so that ore production has improved a lot more than in the past.

In the transportation system, from stations to locomotive depots, from dispatching to loading and unloading sites, a mass movement to receive raw materials and serve as a "pioneer" has also been launched enthusiastically. Under the leadership of the Angang Party Committee, the transportation department workers are first adopting the method of cadres going to the front line, dividing the work into sections, mobilizing the masses, and organizing multi-trade collaboration to launch a joint technical performance competition inside and outside the factory. In the first ten days of February alone, 168 "one-dragon" trains were received and dispatched, saving the state 21,480 car-hours. The workers at Lingshan Station use "multi-stage rockets" and "small dragon" trains from the railway bureau to directly send the incoming heavy vehicles to the unloading station, reducing the vehicle turnaround time to 3.3 hours, exceeding the vehicle turnaround target. At the same time, to achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization of unloading and accelerate vehicle turnaround, all employees fought day and night, modifying and newly manufacturing 127 machines such as hot pressing machines, hand-held scrapers, and electric shovels, and 191 kinds of simple tools, shortening the loading and unloading time from 1.5 hours to 1.25 hours.

All factories and mines have strengthened equipment maintenance and repair, and adhered to scheduled maintenance. When No. 9 blast furnace was undergoing medium repair according to plan in the first ten days of February, it improved the charging cover and increased the air volume. The utilization coefficient of the blast furnace in the past five days has increased sharply from 2.351 in January to 2.479. Open hearth steelmaking workers have also launched a competition between furnaces around the central link of furnace body maintenance to ensure long life and high production of open hearth furnaces. In order to cooperate with equipment maintenance and repair, the workers of the three machinery repair plants have launched a technical innovation upsurge, delivering the needed spare parts and accessories to the door in advance or on time. Wang Chonglun, deputy director of the tool workshop of the Northern Machinery Repair Plant and a well-known technical innovation expert, and the workers in the workshop jointly created the successful "double-drill automatic lathe," which increased the efficiency of processing iron ore mountain screen plates by fourteen times. The comprehensive section of the Southern Machinery Repair Plant has completed the production tasks of spare parts and accessories for February ahead of schedule.

    大抓生产黄金季节　力夺三月更大丰收
    鞍钢抓生产又抓准备
    原料、运输和检修部门职工全线总动员
    本报鞍山26日电　鞍山钢铁公司在猛抓当前生产的同时，积极从原料、运输和设备检修等三方面为3月份生产继续跃进作好准备。
    随着生产不断增加，原料、运输和设备检修必须跟上去。针对这种情况，鞍钢党委会进行了数次讨论与研究，并做出了加强原料、运输、设备检修等工作的决定。各厂矿都把加强矿山、运输和设备检修当成一项重要政治任务，迅速开展了一个轰轰烈烈的大抓原料、运输和设备检修的群众运动。目前，铁矿石的产量已比上旬提高5．4％，铁精矿提高7．1％；货车一次作业时间由二十二点五小时缩短为十八小时，车辆保有辆减少17％；许多厂矿的设备都检修得很好。
    在原料方面，鞍钢党委首先加强了对铁矿石和精矿粉生产的领导。一方面派一位党委书记和一位副经理到主要原料基地，发动群众大搞技术革新和技术革命，一方面发动其他工厂开展共产主义大协作。樱桃园铁矿职工在2月份头十一天里，就实现了一百九十一件重大技术革新，提前三天半完成了上半月的生产计划，生产水平比去年12月份猛增18．6％。弓长岭铁矿在任务增多的情况下，缺乏技术人员和设备，不能及时检修球磨机，影响矿石产量的增长。这一情况为烧结总厂、北部机修厂知道以后，立刻从生产岗位抽出钳工、车工等一百二十多人和几十台机床前去支援，加强了机械维修力量，减少了事故，保证了机械正常运转，使中旬精矿粉的产量比上旬猛增24 ．8％。东鞍山浮选厂猛攻过滤关的时候，烧结总厂、南部机修厂、电修厂、结水厂和鞍钢机械处、动力处等十个单位，抽出有经验老工人、革新能手、工程技术人员和管理干部三十余人，联合组成共产主义协作队前去帮助，使矿石生产比过去提高了很多。
    在运输系统，从车站到机务段，从调度到装卸现场，一个接运原料做好“先行官”的群众运动也热烈展开。运输部职工正在鞍钢党委领导下，首先采取了干部亲临前沿，分片包干发动群众，组织多工种大协作的办法，掀起了厂内外“一条龙”的联合技术表演赛。仅2月上旬，就接入和发出“一条龙”列车一百六十八列，给国家节省二万一千四百八十车小时。灵山车站的职工从铁路局接入的重车用“多级火箭”和厂内“小龙”列车的形式，直接送到卸车站，使车辆中转时间压缩到三点三小时，超额完成了车辆周转指标。同时，围绕卸车实现机械化、半机械化，加速车辆周转，全体职工昼夜奋战，修改和新制了霍片机、手扶拉铲和电铲等机械一百二十七台和简易工具一百九十一种，使装卸时间由一点五小时，缩短为一点二五小时。
    各厂矿加强了设备的维护检修工作，坚持按计划检修。九号高炉在2月上旬按计划进行中修时，改进了布料大盖，增加了风量，最近五天的高炉利用系数已从1月份的二点三五一猛增到二点四七九。平炉炼钢职工也围绕炉体维护这一中心环节，展开了炉与炉之间的竞赛，保证平炉长寿高产。为了配合设备维护检修，三个机修厂的职工掀起了技术革新热潮，把需要的备品和配件提前或按时送上门去。北部机修厂工具车间副主任、著名的技术革新能手王崇伦，同车间工人一道，共同创造成功“双钻自动车”，使加工铁矿山筛子板的效率提高十四倍。南部机修厂综合工段已提前完成2月份备品、配件生产任务。
