    Developing Light Industry Raw Material Bases
    Light Industry Department of Inner Mongolia Establishes Bases to Strive for Gradual Self-Sufficiency in Raw Materials
    Rui'an Baihao Dairy Plant Broadens Milk Sources by Supporting Livestock Development

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot Telegram: The Light Industry Department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is actively establishing raw material bases.

More than 100 wineries, sugar factories, and tobacco factories distributed throughout the autonomous region have established raw material bases for hops, tobacco leaves, and sugar beets on more than 800,000 mu of fertile land in various banners and counties. Paper mills in various regions have also determined to establish fixed reed cultivation areas in the Yellow River, West Liao River basin, and on the shores of Wuliangsuhai and Wuzhenhai lakes. Various dairy plants have established many fixed areas for contracted raw milk purchase in state-owned pastures and people's communes in Hulunbuir, Xilin Gol, Ulanqab, Bayannur, and Ikezhao Leagues. According to the spirit of "obtaining materials locally and processing them locally," the light industry departments of Zhaowuda League have established raw material production bases for willow branches, reeds, sugar beets, tobacco leaves, etc., covering an area of more than 400,000 mu.

The establishment of these raw material bases can enable the newly developed light industries in the autonomous region to gradually achieve self-sufficiency in raw materials, and promote the planned production of various industrial raw materials in various parts of the autonomous region. In order to do a good job in the planting of raw material bases, the Light Industry Department of the Autonomous Region sent specialized technicians to various communes to guide production, and trained technicians locally to improve planting techniques.

Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 16th: The Rui'an Baihao Dairy Plant in Zhejiang has started by actively supporting the development of agriculture and animal husbandry to establish its own raw material base in rural areas, opening up a broad source of raw materials for the plant's sustained leap forward in production.

Baihao Dairy Plant uses milk as raw material to produce six kinds of products, including the famous "Panda" brand sweetened condensed milk and cream, both at home and abroad. This factory is built in the countryside, and the production of raw materials does not rely on the factory's own very few dairy cows, but mainly relies on the supply of milk squeezed from local rural cattle. In 1958, the rural areas realized the people's commune system, and cattle were collectively raised. The county promoted the comprehensive utilization of cattle for plowing, milking, and breeding calves. The number of dairy cows increased significantly. Taking advantage of this good situation, Baihao Dairy Plant actively adopted various measures to support the development of local agriculture and animal husbandry from many aspects such as technology, material resources, and manpower, establish raw material bases, and open up milk sources. Under the leadership of the Rui'an County Party Committee, the factory has established raw material bases in sixteen communes throughout the county since last year, and has developed to parts of Pingyang and Taishun counties in neighboring counties, including twenty-two communes, with more than 10,000 cows, and more than 4,000 cows being milked every day; in the fourth quarter of last year, the average daily output of fresh milk was more than 9,000 jin, an increase of more than eight times compared with the highest daily milk production before liberation.

In the process of establishing raw material bases, Baihao Dairy Plant trained more than 160 milking workers and established 60 milking stations in various communes. They helped more than a dozen condensed milk preliminary processing factories to be built in communes 50 li away from the factory.

After the raw material base was established, Baihao Dairy Plant actively assisted various communes and production teams to continue to summarize and promote advanced experiences in the comprehensive utilization, feeding, and management of cattle. More than 160 milking workers distributed in various communes have become a major force in promoting the comprehensive utilization of cattle. Recently, Baihao Dairy Plant also assisted relevant departments of the county party committee to train more than 200 all-round herdsmen for various communes. They will not only raise livestock, but also milk and make preliminary condensed milk.

In order to promote the high-speed development of cattle, Baihao Dairy Plant has established a demonstration livestock farm to breed fine breeds of cattle for the commune. The factory uses their Dutch bulls to cross with local yellow cattle to breed a new variety of "Ruian Baihao cattle". This kind of cattle is large in size, strong in pulling force, produces a lot of milk, and has a long life. Now there have been two or three hundred "Ruian Baihao cattle" in the county. Baihao Dairy Plant also tapped the potential of its own livestock farm and set up a calf "nursery" to raise some calves for the nearby communes to solve the problem that dairy cows are inconvenient to raise calves when plowing the fields. Last year, a total of more than 800 calves were raised in the county, which not only expanded the commune's animal power, but also added a batch of reserve dairy cows for the factory's dairy production.

With no worries about milk sources, the workers have a particularly strong enthusiasm for production. The dairy production of this factory has been rising steadily. Last year, the output of dairy products from Baihao Dairy Plant increased by 7.3 times compared with the early days of liberation, the output value increased by nine times, and the quality has been greatly improved. Nearby communes have also increased their income. Last year alone, the communes sent a total of 388,770 jin of fresh milk to the factory, receiving more than 530,000 yuan in milk payments.

    发展轻工业原料基地
    内蒙古轻工业部门建立基地争取原料逐步自给
    瑞安百好乳品厂通过支援畜牧业发展广辟乳源
    据新华社呼和浩特电　内蒙古自治区轻工业部门正在积极建立原料基地。
    分布在自治区各地的一百多处制酒厂、制糖厂和烟草厂，已在各旗县八十多万亩肥沃的土地上，建立了酒花、烟叶和甜菜等原料基地。各地的造纸厂，也已确定在黄河、西辽河流域和乌梁素海、乌镇海湖滨，建立固定的芦苇培植地区。各乳品厂，在呼伦贝尔、锡林郭勒、乌兰察布、巴彦淖尔、伊克昭等盟的国营牧场和各人民公社，建立了许多分片包干的原奶收购的固定地区。昭乌达盟各轻工业部门，根据“就地取材，就地加工”的精神，建立面积达四十多万亩的柳条、芦苇、甜菜、烟叶等原料生产基地。
    这些原料基地的建立，可以使自治区新发展起来的各种轻工业逐步做到原料自给，促进自治区各地有计划地生产各种工业原料。为把原料基地的种植工作作好，自治区轻工业厅派专门技术人员到各公社指导生产，并在当地训练技术人员，提高种植技术。
    本报杭州16日电　浙江瑞安百好乳品厂从积极支援农业、畜牧业发展着手，在农村建立自己的原料基地，为本厂生产持续跃进开辟了广阔的原料来源。
    百好乳品厂以牛奶作原料，生产国内外有名的“熊猫”牌甜炼乳和奶油等六种产品。这个厂建立在农村，生产原料不依靠本厂畜牧场极少的奶牛，主要靠当地农村耕牛挤奶供应。1958年农村实现人民公社化，耕牛集体饲养，全县推广了耕牛耕田、挤奶、繁殖小牛综合利用。奶牛显著增加。百好乳品厂趁着这个好形势，积极采取各种措施，从技术、物力、人力等许多方面去支持当地农业、畜牧业的发展，建立原料基地，开辟乳源。在中共瑞安县委的领导下，这个厂从去年以来，已在全县十六个公社建立了原料基地，并且发展到邻县——平阳、泰顺两县的部分地区，包括二十二个公社，拥有一万多头母牛，每天挤奶的在四千多头以上；去年第四季度，平均日产鲜奶九千多斤，比解放前最高日产奶量增长八倍多。
    在建立原料基地的过程中，百好乳品厂培训了一百六十多名挤奶工人，在各个公社建立了六十个挤奶站。他们帮助距工厂五十华里外的公社建了十几个炼乳初制工厂。
    原料基地建立起来以后，百好乳品厂便积极协助各公社和生产队继续总结和推广耕牛综合利用、饲养和管理工作方面的先进经验。分布各公社的一百六十多名挤奶工人成为推广耕牛综合利用的一批主要力量。最近，百好乳品厂还协助县委有关部门为各公社训练了二百多名多面手饲养员，他们不但会饲养，还会挤奶和初制炼乳。
    为了促进耕牛高速度发展，百好乳品厂举办了一个示范畜牧场，为公社繁殖良种牛。这个厂用他们的荷兰公牛同当地黄牛杂交，繁殖新品种“瑞安百好牛”。这种牛体型大，拉力强，奶量多，寿命长。现在全县已出现了二、三百头“瑞安百好牛”。百好乳品厂还挖掘自己畜牧场的潜力，设立了小牛“托儿所”，为就近地区的公社代养一部分小牛，以解决奶牛耕田不便养小牛的问题。去年全县共养活小牛八百多头，这不仅扩大了公社的畜力，还为这个厂的乳品生产增添了一批后备奶牛。
    奶源无忧，工人生产劲头特别大。这个厂的乳品生产节节上升。去年百好乳品厂的乳品产量比解放初期增加了七点三倍，产值增长九倍，质量有很大提高。附近公社也增加了收入。去年一年，各公社送进工厂的鲜奶共三十八万八千七百七十斤，得到奶款五十三万多元。
