    Flowers of Friendship Bloom Redly
    Yuan Zhiwei, Yu Zhenjiang

    The Heilongjiang River, a long and ancient stream, with China and the Soviet Union on either side;
    United and helping each other, like close brothers, flowers of friendship bloom redly.

    The people living in the Heihe Special District of Heilongjiang Province, in the northeast border region of our country, use these verses to praise their deep friendship with the people of the Amur Oblast of the Soviet Union, on the north bank of the Heilongjiang River. Although separated by a river of friendship, they get along as closely as siblings, and the stories of their friendship are endless and cannot be fully written. In the land of the Heihe area, excellent seeds donated by the Soviet people are cultivated; on the grasslands and pastures, excellent breeds of horses donated by the Soviet people gallop; and the apple trees of the Soviet Far East are also blossoming and bearing fruit in the land of the Heihe area, just like the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples.

          Seeds of Friendship

    In the experimental fields of the Heihe Special District Agricultural Science Research Institute, more than thirty excellent crop varieties from the Amur Oblast of the Soviet Union are cultivated, including wheat, soybeans, corn, potatoes, sugar beets, etc. On the land of the State Agricultural Experimental Station of the Amur Oblast of the Soviet Union, more than ten excellent varieties from our country are also growing, such as "Gansu No. 96" millet, Hezuo No. 6 millet, and Zihua No. 4 soybean. These are all mutually gifted by the Heihe Special District Agricultural Science Research Institute and the State Agricultural Experimental Station of the Amur Oblast of the Soviet Union.

    In 1958, agricultural science and technology workers from the Amur Oblast of the Soviet Union were invited to visit the Heihe Special District Agricultural Science Research Institute. When the Soviet friends learned that the soybean varieties introduced from the southern part of Heilongjiang Province to the Heihe area had unstable yields, they returned to their country and sent back two excellent soybean varieties, "Amur No. 41" and "Salute No. 216", which they had painstakingly cultivated for more than forty years and possessed the characteristics of high yield, early maturity, cold resistance, and high oil content. In that year, the Heihe Special District Agricultural Science Research Institute successfully cultivated these two excellent soybean varieties in the experimental fields. Last year, they were developed to 6,000 mu throughout the district, and in the autumn, they achieved good harvests, with a general increase in production of 10% to 30% compared to local varieties. This year, the Heihe area plans to continue to expand planting to more than 30,000 mu.

    In the experimental fields of the State Agricultural Experimental Station of the Amur Oblast of the Soviet Union, agricultural crop varieties from our country are cultivated. Whenever agricultural workers from the Heihe Special District are invited to visit, Soviet friends always ask their Chinese comrades to visit these experimental fields first. Soviet friends said meaningfully: "Soviet crop seeds have been planted on Chinese land, and Chinese crop seeds have been planted on Soviet land. These seeds, like the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, are constantly blossoming and bearing fruit."

          Friendship Horses All Over Heihe

    The famous "Heihe Big Horse" is a hybrid of Soviet horse breeds and local Heihe horses. The people of Heihe praise this excellent horse breed, which is tall and strong, as a "friendship horse". This "friendship horse" is now all over the villages along the Heilongjiang River in the Heihe Special District. The state-run Heihe Northern Livestock Farm has bred more than 200 horses, becoming an important breeding base for "friendship horses", and continuously providing excellent horse breeds for the development of animal husbandry in various state-run farms and people's communes throughout the district.

    Back in January 1957, in order to help the Heihe area improve its horse breeds, collective farms in the Amur Oblast of the Soviet Union donated twenty-five excellent horse breeds to the people of the Heihe Special District, including the "Soviet Heavy Draft Horse" and the "Orlov Trotter", which can carry 10,000 jin of weight. When they were sent, Komarov, the chairman of the Executive Committee of the Soviet of the Amur Oblast of the Soviet Union, personally handed over all the files of these twenty-five horses to Wang Shutang, the first secretary of the CPC Heihe Prefectural Committee. At the horse donation ceremony, Comrade Komarov said: These horses are the best horse breeds selected by the collective farms of the Amur Oblast, and they have come to China with the good intentions of the Soviet people. May they contribute to the development of animal husbandry and agriculture in the Heihe area, and let these horses, which symbolize Sino-Soviet friendship, spread throughout the Heihe Special District. Now, the wishes of Soviet friends have been realized. These twenty-five good horse breeds have bred more than 200 horses in more than three years.

          Friendship Fruit Trees Take Root

    The apples cultivated in the Amur Oblast of the Soviet Union are large, delicious, and have high yields, with two or three weighing one jin. Now, dozens of seedlings of these large apples are planted in the orchard of the Heihe Special District Agricultural Science Research Institute.

    In the autumn of 1958, when Soviet friends were invited to visit the Heihe Special District Agricultural Science Research Institute, they praised the fact that the staff here had successfully cultivated apple trees from inland China in the cold zone. However, this fruit tree was not yet very adaptable, and the fruit was small. In order to help the Heihe Special District develop fruit production, they sent sixty apple seedlings back to their country. Last spring, apple seedlings of six new varieties, such as "Early Maturing Antonovka," appeared in the orchard of the Heihe Special District Agricultural Science Research Institute. Later, Soviet friends visited the orchard every time they came here. When Soviet friends saw that all these fruit tree seedlings had survived, they said happily: "These are friendship fruit tree seedlings, and they have taken root. In the future, they will surely bear large apples symbolizing Sino-Soviet friendship." (Xinhua News Agency)

    友谊花开朵朵红
    苑志维　于振江
    源远流长黑龙江，中苏人民住两旁；
    团结互助亲兄弟，友谊花开朵朵红。
    居住在我国东北部边疆黑龙江省黑河专区的人民，用这样的诗句来赞美他们同黑龙江北岸苏联阿穆尔州人民的深厚友谊。他们虽然隔着一条友谊的河水，但相处的却亲如手足，友谊的故事说不完也写不尽。在黑河地区的土地上，栽培着苏联人民赠送的优良种子；在草原和牧场上，奔驰着苏联人民赠送的优良马种；而苏联远东的苹果树，也在黑河地区的土地上，像中苏两国人民的友谊一样开花结果了。
          友谊的种子
    在黑河专区农业科学研究所的试验田里，培育着苏联阿穆尔州的三十多个优良农作物品种，其中包括小麦、大豆、玉米、马铃薯、甜菜等。在苏联阿穆尔州国家农业试验站的土地上，也生长着我国的“甘肃九六号”合作六号小米和紫花四号大豆等十多种优良品种。这些，都是黑河专区农业科学研究所同苏联阿穆尔州国家农业试验站互相赠送的。
    1958年，苏联阿穆尔州农业科学技术工作者，应邀来黑河专区农业科学研究所参观。当苏联朋友们了解到黑河地区由黑龙江省南部引进来的大豆品种产量不稳定的情况，回国后就送来了经他们苦心培育四十多年的、具有高产、早熟、抗寒、含油率高等特点的“阿穆尔四一号”和“礼炮二一六号”两个大豆优良品种。这两个大豆优良品种，黑河专区农业科学研究所这一年在试验田里培育成功。去年在全区发展到六千亩，秋天获得了良好的收成，比当地品种普遍增产10％到30％。今年黑河地区计划继续扩大种植到三万多亩。
    在苏联阿穆尔州国家农业试验站的试验田里，培育着我国的农作物品种，每当黑河专区农业工作人员应邀前去访问时，苏联朋友总是要请中国同志先去参观这些试验田。苏联朋友意味深长地说：“在中国的土地上种上了苏联的农作物种子，在苏联的土地上种上了中国农作物种子。这些种子就像中苏两国人民的友谊一样，正在不断开花结果。”
          友谊良马遍黑河
    著名的“黑河大马”，是苏联马种和黑河当地马的杂交种。黑河人民把这种身材高大、挽力强的优良马种誉为“友谊马”。这种“友谊马”，现在已遍布黑河专区黑龙江沿岸的各个乡村。国营黑河北方畜牧农场繁殖了二百多匹，成了“友谊马”的重要繁殖基地，不断为全区各国营农场、人民公社发展畜牧业提供着优良马种。
    还是在1957年1月，苏联阿穆尔州各集体农庄为了帮助黑河地区改良马种，赠给了黑河专区人民二十五匹优良的马种，其中有能拖载一万斤重的“苏维埃重挽马”和“奥尔洛夫马”。送来时，苏联阿穆尔州苏维埃执行委员会主席科马洛夫，亲手把这二十五匹马的全部档案交给了中共黑河地委第一书记王树棠。在赠马仪式上，科马洛夫同志说：这些马是阿穆尔州各集体农庄挑选的最好马种，它带着苏联人民的心意来到了中国，愿它为发展黑河地区的畜牧业和农业贡献力量，让这些象征中苏友谊的马遍布黑河专区。现在，苏联朋友的愿望实现了。这二十五匹良马种经过三年多的时间，已繁殖了二百多匹。
          友谊果树扎下根
    苏联阿穆尔州培育出来的苹果，个大、味美、产量高，两三个就有一斤重。现在在黑河专区农业科学研究所的果园里，栽植了几十株这种大苹果的树苗。
    1958年秋天，苏联朋友应邀到黑河专区农业科学研究所参观时，看到这里的工作人员把我国内地的苹果树在寒带培育成功，非常称赞。但是这种果树适应性还不太强，果实较小。为了帮助黑河专区发展水果生产，他们回国后送来了六十株苹果树苗。去年春天，在黑河专区农业科学研究所的果园里，就出现了“早熟安东诺夫卡”等六个新品种的苹果树苗。以后，苏联朋友每到这里都到果园里看一看。苏联朋友看到这些果树苗全部成活，高兴地说：“这是友谊的果树苗，它已扎下了根子，将来一定会结出象征中苏友谊的大苹果。”　（新华社）
