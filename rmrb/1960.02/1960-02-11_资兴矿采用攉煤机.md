    Zixing Coal Mine in Hunan vigorously promoted the experience of Fuxin Mining Bureau, realizing the mechanization of coal throwing, which reduced the labor force in this process by more than 90%.
    When the leading personnel of this mine saw the news in the newspaper about the successful trial of the coal-throwing machine by Fuxin Mining Bureau, they immediately sent a telegram to Fuxin requesting the drawings of this machine. As soon as the drawings arrived, they immediately started manufacturing. In just ten days, all the main mining faces of the mine adopted coal-throwing machines.

    资兴矿采用攉煤机
    湖南资兴煤矿大力推广阜新矿务局经验，实现了攉煤机械化，使这一工序减人九成多。
    这个矿的领导人员看到报上介绍阜新矿务局试验攉煤机成功的消息，立即拍电报向阜新要这种机器的图纸。图纸一到，马上制造。仅十天，全矿主要回采面都采用了攉煤机。
