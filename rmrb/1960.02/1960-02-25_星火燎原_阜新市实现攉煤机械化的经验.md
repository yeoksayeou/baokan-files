Sparks Can Start a Prairie Fire
——The Experience of Fuxin City in Achieving Mechanization of Coal Shoveling
Xiao Guang, Secretary of the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    From mid-December 1959, the Fuxin mining area gradually formed a magnificent new upsurge of technical innovation and technical revolution. This upsurge started with the creation of the coal shoveling machine and quickly developed into a large-scale mass movement to put down iron shovels and achieve mechanization of coal shoveling. On November 25th of last year, employees of the Xinqiu Coal Mine successfully created the first "Red Flag No. 1" coal shoveling machine. Ten days later, the Ping'an Coal Mine also successfully manufactured the "Type 59" coal shoveling machine. On December 14th, the Municipal Party Committee and the Mining Bureau held an on-site meeting at Xinqiu Mine to exchange and promote the experience of these two mines in creating coal shoveling machines. The next day, Ping'an Mine basically achieved full mechanization of coal shoveling throughout the mine. Immediately afterward, the Haizhou Open-pit Mine also successfully trial-produced another type of coal shoveling machine. These encouraging news stirred the entire mining area of the city. By December 20th of last year, with the exception of some underground working faces where shoveling was not needed at all, 2,328 coal shoveling workers in 59 underground coal mining sections and most tunneling teams under the three mines of the entire mining area put down their large iron shovels, which had been used for generations, and replaced their heavy physical labor with 193 coal shoveling machines. This is a historically significant major technological revolution in coal production. The mechanization of coal shoveling, which miners had dreamed of for many years, miraculously became a living reality in just five days and nights. Truly, "A spring breeze overnight turns the land red, and sparks start a prairie fire in the coal city."

    A Small Machine Sparks a Big Revolution

    The Fuxin Mining Bureau is a modern coal mine with a high degree of mechanization. On the coal mining face, coal cutting and coal transportation are both mechanized, but the coal shoveling process, sandwiched between these two procedures, is heavy physical labor, like a cart pulled by oxen sandwiched between two cars, becoming the weakest link in production and unable to meet the needs of increased production. At the same time, coal shoveling is precisely the most tiring and arduous labor for miners. Therefore, as soon as the coal shoveling machine was born, the miners excitedly spread the word: "This time we must divorce ourselves from the big iron shovel!" An old worker named Li Wanrong, who was recuperating at home in the first pit of Xinqiu Mine, heard that a coal shoveling machine had been developed and, disregarding the leadership's dissuasion, insisted on going down the mine to take a look. After actually operating it, he said: "With this treasure, I can work for the country for another twenty years." Miners composed many poems to praise the coal shoveling machine. Workers at Xinqiu Mine wrote this poem: "For many years, we shoveled with big shovels, sweat streaming down our backs. Today, holding the 'Little Iron Ox,' we work lightly and effortlessly."

    Workers at Ping'an Mine sang: "Coal shoveling machine, coal shoveling machine, you are our good weapon; with you, we don't have to rely on physical strength; with you, ten thousand zhang coal mountains become flat ground; with you, doubling production is not rare; with you, our enthusiasm soars and drums are full; with you, we create miracles in the Great Leap Forward era; coal shoveling machine, coal shoveling machine, we are willing to accompany you to Beijing to see Chairman Mao."

    The workers all said that with the coal shoveling machine, it's like having wings, and continuing the Great Leap Forward this year is a certainty. The entire mining area is truly filled with smiles, cheerful moods, and soaring enthusiasm.

    The facts are indeed so. After using the coal shoveling machine, production in the mining area is booming, and labor productivity has significantly improved. From January 1st to 9th this year, the average daily coal production underground in the Fuxin mining area increased by 16.6% compared to the same period in December last year. The fourth mining area of Ping'an Vertical Shaft, which uses the "Type 59" coal shoveling machine, nearly doubled its output during this period, and the coal mining progress—opening the cut—increased from 1.8 meters to 3.6 meters. The coal shoveling machine is three to six times more efficient than manual coal shoveling. After a coal mining team in the twenty-first section of the fourth pit of Xinqiu Mine used the coal shoveling machine, the number of personnel was reduced by nearly half, and the output increased by nearly doubled. The Fuxin Mining Bureau originally planned to add more than 4,000 new workers this year. With the widespread development of technical renovation work centered on the coal shoveling machine, various small machines have emerged one after another. Now, instead of adding people, more than 2,000 people have been reduced and supported other types of work.

        The Source of Victory

    Strengthening Party leadership, adhering to the general line, adhering to putting politics in command, and implementing the Party's policy of "walking on two legs" are the source of victory for all work, and also the source of victory for the realization of coal shoveling mechanization in our city's entire mining area.

    The Fuxin Mining Bureau has been engaged in the design and trial production of coal shoveling machines for many years. Ping'an Mine and Xinqiu Mine have both proposed hundreds of design plans for coal shoveling machines and have undergone hundreds of experiments, but all have failed. The machines that were designed were all large and bulky, capable of moving above ground but unusable underground. Clearly, this was the result of being divorced from the masses, divorced from reality, seeking large size and profundity. However, some people have become discouraged and afraid to experiment boldly.

    With the development of production, the coal shoveling process has become even more incompatible. In the fourth quarter of last year, the Fuxin Municipal Party Committee boldly and resolutely put forward the slogan of "Put down the iron shovel and realize the mechanization of coal shoveling," which was immediately warmly supported by the vast number of workers, especially the underground miners, but was opposed by some people. They said, "The problem that no country in the world has solved, how can you do it?" "To create a coal shoveling machine is a dream!" These people were full of superstitious ideas and at the same time attempted to use their superstitious ideas to influence the broad masses. The Party organization armed the broad masses with the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, so that the masses realized that the working people are the creators of history, what others can do, we can do, and what others cannot do, we can also do. Since putting down the iron shovel is a need for the development of production and a pressing desire dreamed of by the broad masses, why can't it be realized?

    Under the education of the Party, the broad masses who liberated their minds displayed infinite wisdom. The Party Committee of Xinqiu Mine promptly summarized the lessons of past deviations from reality and the idea of seeking large size and profundity, and organized technicians to go down the mine to participate in labor. Technician Xu Benyang, while participating in coal shoveling labor underground, together with the workers, investigated the production environment of the working face and realized that only small and simple machinery is suitable for application on the working face. Therefore, based on more than 900 suggestions made by workers, technicians, and leading cadres, he proposed the "Red Flag No. 1" coal shoveling machine plan that conformed to objective reality. After concrete supplementation and repeated testing by the workers, he finally created an unprecedented miracle. The "Red Flag No. 1" coal shoveling machine was neither created by a foreign country nor invented by a research institute, but a product of the mass movement under the leadership of the Party, and a victory of the Party's "walking on two legs" policy. Inspired by the "Red Flag No. 1" coal shoveling machine, the "Type 59" coal shoveling machine created by workers at Ping'an Mine is even more a treasure of ingenious craftsmanship. However, its creators—Zhang Guowen and others, workers at Ping'an Vertical Shaft—succeeded in manufacturing this new machine using scrap materials without even drawing a complete design blueprint. Facts prove that continuously breaking superstitions and liberating the mind will lead to constant miracles.

        In the Face of New Things

    When new things begin to appear on the horizon, they cannot be perfect. How to treat new things is a concrete test of whether a Party organization adheres to the general line and possesses the revolutionary determination of the proletariat. When the coal shoveling machine was first tested, some machine handles broke, machine teeth bent, and some machine buttons did not work, charging around and not very docile. So some people said, "What's the use of such a clumsy thing, it's better to use a shovel," pouring cold water and blowing cold wind on the new things. However, the coal shoveling machine is the crystallization of the wisdom of the broad masses, and it has been so warmly supported and loved by the broad masses. Those who participated in the design, manufacture, testing, and promotion included electromechanical workers, coal mining workers, tunneling workers, engineers, technicians, Party committee secretaries, mine managers, and grassroots cadres, numbering no less than ten thousand. It has such a broad mass base. If the masses can create a coal shoveling machine, they will certainly be able to make it grow and develop. Therefore, we firmly believe that new things have strong vitality. Although they start as a seedling, they will always grow and develop.

    Some people said that the coal shoveling machine created by Ping'an Mine is so crude that it doesn't look like a machine. We believe that this is a machine, and a very good machine at that. It can increase efficiency three times more than manual coal shoveling, what does it matter if it's a little crude! Any new technology or new invention must go through a process from low-level to high-level, from popularization to improvement. If it can be foreign, then be foreign; if it can be indigenous, then be indigenous. If we can't make it foreign for the time being, then we will make it indigenous first. With the indigenous, we can gradually improve it in the direction of foreign. Our Party organizations at all levels not only keenly discovered its budding but also enthusiastically supported and cultivated the growth of the coal shoveling machine. In grasping the mechanization of coal shoveling, in addition to adhering to the leadership of the secretary, we also promptly convened on-site meetings to promote it. Moreover, the Municipal Party Secretary and the Ping'an Mine Party Secretary first promoted and applied it in the "experimental field," gained experience, and then comprehensively promoted it. And with the efforts of the broad masses of workers, more than ten types of coal shoveling machines were developed in accordance with local conditions. It is not only suitable for coal mining teams but also suitable for various tunneling teams; not only suitable for coal mines but also suitable for many coal loading and unloading operations. In order to make the coal shoveling machine suitable for use in high-gas mining areas, the workers also installed explosion-proof equipment. In this way, the coal shoveling machine not only can be used but also becomes more and more perfect, and finally is universally promoted.

    The tortuous process of the birth and development of the coal shoveling machine has made us realize that when Party organizations organize technical innovation and technical revolution movements, they must fiercely and tightly grasp the bud of new things, and not give up until success, not give up until promotion, and not give up until improvement. Facts prove this truth: a single spark can start a prairie fire.

    New Collaboration, Comprehensive Leap Forward

    A coal mine is a highly continuous production enterprise, and the close relationship between each process and each department is like a linkage machine, an organic whole. The successful creation of the coal shoveling machine has brought about significant changes in the coal mining process. It promotes and requires other processes to quickly keep up, and requires improving the work of drilling and blasting, propping, and electric chute transportation around the mechanization of coal shoveling so that the various processes organically connected in the coal mining face can leap forward together. After using the coal shoveling machine, the coal shoveling efficiency has increased several times. Other types of work that were originally advanced now appear backward. We paid attention to this problem and immediately proposed to carry out technical performance competitions of advanced experience and technical innovation centered on the coal shoveling machine. Advanced experiences related to drilling and blasting, propping, watching chutes, moving chutes, and roof management that were effective in the past or newly created were combined into sets, and many advanced experiences were promoted, so that the work of various types of work and various processes on the coal mining face was comprehensively improved.

    In order to realize the mechanization of coal shoveling, under the leadership of the Party, all departments broke through the boundaries between types of work and between units. Employees of production, electromechanical, and supply departments all united as one and stepped up the production of coal shoveling machines. Encouraged by the success of the coal shoveling machine, the Twelfth Factory actively used indigenous methods to trial-produce millisecond detonators in order to solve the blasting problem, and quickly increased the daily output from 300 to 10,000. Auxiliary departments used to "sit and wait for customers," but now they go deep into the front lines and actively cooperate. Each unit takes the tasks of others as their own and regards the difficulties of others as their own. This communist style of "giving convenience to others and keeping difficulties for oneself" is extremely valuable. The Great Leap Forward requires great collaboration to ensure it, and technical innovation and technical revolution cannot lack great collaboration, especially the need for close cooperation between electromechanical departments and scientific research departments and production departments, twisting into a single rope. We organized the city's coal, electricity, transportation, local industry, and other departments, as well as various service departments, into a large collaboration, helping each other and ensuring each other. This is a new development in the unity and collaboration of enterprises in the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution.

    Due to the short time of the coal shoveling mechanization movement in the Fuxin mining area, the coal shoveling machine cannot be said to be perfect, and other production links and management work have not been able to keep up closely. On the other hand, the equipment utilization rate of some enterprises in our city is not high enough, and many production processes are still manual labor. Therefore, we must never relax and be complacent. We must take advantage of the victory and advance further, further strengthen Party leadership, adhere to putting politics in command, continue to exert great effort, and realize the continued leap forward this year.

    星火燎原
    ——阜新市实现攉煤机械化的经验
    中共阜新市委书记　萧光
    阜新煤矿区从1959年12月中旬起，逐渐形成一个波澜壮阔的技术革新和技术革命的新高潮。这个高潮是从创造攉煤机开始的，很快就发展成为放下铁锹，实现攉煤机械化的大规模群众运动。去年11月25日，新丘煤矿职工创造成功了第一台“红旗一号”攉煤机，十天以后，平安煤矿又制造成功了“五九式”攉煤机。12月14日，市委和矿务局在新丘矿召开现场会议，交流和推广了这两个矿创制攉煤机的经验。第二天，平安矿就基本上实现了全矿的攉煤机械化。紧接着，海州露天矿也试制成功了另一种攉煤机。这些振奋人心的消息轰动了全市整个矿区，到去年12月20日，除了一些根本不用攉锹的井下工作面而外，全矿区所属三个矿的五十九个井下采煤段和大部分掘进队的二千三百二十八名攉煤工人，先后放下了世世代代沿用的大铁锹，以一百九十三台攉煤机代替了他们繁重的体力劳动。这是煤炭生产具有历史意义的重大技术革命。矿工们多少年来梦想的攉煤机械化，在短短五昼夜的时间里，就奇迹般地变成了活生生的现实。真是：“一夜春风红满地，星火燎原煤炭城”。
    小机械掀起大革命
    阜新矿务局是一个机械化程度较高的现代化煤矿。在采煤工作面上，落煤和运煤都是机械化的，而夹在这两道工序之间的攉煤工序却是笨重的体力劳动，就好像两辆汽车中间夹着一辆牛车，成了生产中最薄弱的环节，不能适应增产的需要。同时，攉煤工作也正是矿工们最累、最艰苦的一项劳动。因此，当攉煤机刚一诞生，矿工们激动地奔走相告：“这回非跟大铁锹打离婚不可啦！”新丘矿一坑有个在家养病的老工人名叫李万荣，听说搞成了攉煤机，不顾领导上的劝阻，非要下井照量照量不可。实际操纵以后，他说：“有了这个宝贝，我还可以为国家多干二十年。”矿工们编了很多诗歌来赞颂攉煤机。新丘矿工人写了这样一首诗：“多少年来攉大锹，汗珠流了一裤腰，今天手扶‘小铁牛’，干起活来轻飘飘。”
    平安矿工人唱道：攉煤机，攉煤机，你是我们的好武器；有了你，我们不用拼体力；有了你，万丈煤山变平地；有了你，产量翻番不稀奇；有了你，干劲冲天鼓的足；有了你，跃进年代创奇迹；攉煤机，攉煤机，我们愿意伴随你，进京去见毛主席。
    工人们都说，有了攉煤机这个家伙，身上就像长了翅膀一样，今年继续跃进是铁打的了。整个矿区真是人人眉开眼笑，心情舒畅，干劲冲天。
    事实确是这样，使用攉煤机以后，矿区生产蒸蒸日上，劳动生产率显著提高。今年1月1日到9日，阜新矿区井下的平均日产煤量，比去年12月同期提高了16．6％。使用“五九式”攉煤机的平安竖井第四采区，在这期间的产量提高将近一倍，采煤进度——开一遍帮由一点八米提高到三点六米。攉煤机比人工攉煤提高效率三倍至六倍。新丘矿四坑二十一段有个采煤场子使用攉煤机后，人员减去将近一半，产量增加近一倍。阜新矿务局原计划今年增加四千多名新工人，随着以攉煤机为中心的技术改造工作的广泛开展，各种小型机械纷纷出现。现在，不但不用增加人，反而减少了二千多人，支援了其他工种。
        胜利的源泉
    加强党的领导，坚持总路线，坚持政治挂帅，贯彻党的一套两条腿走路的方针，这是一切工作胜利的源泉，也是我市全矿区实现攉煤机械化胜利的源泉。
    阜新矿务局从事攉煤机的设计试制工作，已经多年了。平安矿和新丘矿都先后提出过上百个有关攉煤机的设计方案，也经过了上百次的试验，但是都失败了。设计出来的机器都是又大又笨，在井上能动，到井下就不能用。很清楚，这明明是脱离群众，脱离实际，贪大、求深的结果。可是，有些人却由此而偃旗息鼓，不敢大胆试验了。
    随着生产的发展，攉煤这道工序更加显得不相适应了。去年第四季度，中共阜新市委大胆地、坚决地提出了“放下铁锹，实现攉煤机械化”的口号，立即得到广大职工特别是井下矿工的热烈拥护，但是却遭到了一些人的反对。他们说：“世界各国都没有解决的问题，你们怎么能行？”“要搞成攉煤机那是作梦！”这些人满脑子迷信思想，同时也企图用他们的迷信思想来影响广大群众。党的组织用敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，武装了广大群众，使群众认识到，劳动人民是历史的创造者，别人能做到的我们就能做到，别人做不到的我们也能做到。放下铁锹既然是生产发展的需要，又是广大群众梦寐以求的迫切愿望，为什么不能实现？
    在党的教育下，解放了思想的广大群众，发挥了无穷的智慧。新丘矿党委及时总结了过去脱离实际、贪大求深思想的教训，组织技术人员下井参加劳动。技术员徐本暘，在井下参加攉煤劳动中，和工人一起，考察了工作面的生产环境，认识到只有小巧而简单的机械，才适合工作面上应用。因而根据工人、技术人员、领导干部提出的九百多条鸣放意见，提出了符合客观实际的“红旗一号”攉煤机的方案，并经过工人们具体补充，反复试验，终于创造出史无前例的奇迹。“红旗一号”攉煤机既不是外国创造，也不是研究院发明的，而是在党的领导下，大搞群众运动的产物，是党的“两条腿走路方针”的胜利。在“红旗一号”攉煤机的启发影响下，平安矿工人创造的“五九式”攉煤机更是一台巧夺天工的宝贝。但是它的创造者——平安竖井工人张国文等人，却连一张完整的设计图纸也没有画，就利用废旧材料制造成功了这种新机械。事实证明，不断破除迷信，解放思想，奇迹就会不断出现。
        在新事物面前
    新鲜事物开始出现在地平线上，不可能是完美无缺的。如何对待新事物，这是对一个党组织是否坚持总路线、是否具有无产阶级的革命坚定性的具体考验。攉煤机起初试验时，有的机柄断了、机齿弯了，有的机钮不灵，横冲直撞，不很驯服。于是有人说：“要这么个笨家伙干啥，还不如攉锹快”，给新事物泼冷水，吹冷风。但是，攉煤机是广大群众智慧的结晶，它是那样的得到广大群众的热烈拥护和爱戴。参加设计、制造、试验、推广的，有机电工人、采煤工人、掘进工人、工程师、技术员、党委书记、矿长和基层干部，不下万人。它有着这样广泛的群众基础，群众能够创造攉煤机，就必定能使它成长、壮大。因此我们坚信：新事物具有强大的生命力，开始虽然是个幼芽，将来总会成长壮大的。
    有人说：平安矿创造的攉煤机土得不像话，不是机械。我们认为这是机械，而且是很好的机械。用它就可以比人工攉煤提高效率三倍，土一点有什么关系呢！任何新的技术、新的发明，总要经过由低级到高级，由普及到提高的过程，能洋则洋，能土则土，暂时搞不成洋的就先搞土的，有了土的就可以在这个基础上逐步向洋的方向提高。我们各级党组织不仅敏锐地发现了它的萌芽，而且满腔热情地支持、培育了攉煤机的成长。我们在抓攉煤机械化当中，除了坚持书记挂帅，还及时召开现场会议推广。而且，市委书记和平安矿党委书记一起，在“试验田”里首先推广应用，取得经验，全面推广。并在广大职工的努力下，因地制宜地发展了各式各样不下十余种攉煤机。它不仅适用于采煤场子，而且适用于各种掘进场子；不仅适用于煤矿，而且适用于许多煤炭装卸作业。工人们为了使攉煤机适合高瓦斯采区使用，还安装了防爆设备。这样，攉煤机不但能用，而且越加趋于完善，终于得到普遍推广。
    攉煤机诞生、发展的曲折过程，使我们认识到党的组织在组织技术革新、技术革命运动时，发现新事物的萌芽，必须狠狠地、紧紧地抓住，不成功不罢休，不推广不罢休，不提高不罢休。事实证明这样一个真理：星星之火可以燎原。
    新的协作，全面的跃进
    煤矿是一个高度连续性的生产企业，各个工序、各个部门紧密结合的关系就像一台联动机一样，是一个有机的整体。攉煤机的创造成功，使煤矿采煤过程发生了显著的变化。它促进并要求其他各个工序迅速跟上来，要求围绕攉煤机械化，提高打眼放炮、支柱、电溜子运输等方面的工作，使采煤工作面中有机联系的各个工序共同跃进。使用攉煤机之后，攉煤效率提高了好几倍，原来先进的其他工种，现在显得落后了。我们注意了这个问题，立即提出以攉煤机为中心，开展先进经验、技术革新配套的技术表演赛。过去行之有效或者新创造出来的有关打眼放炮、支柱、看溜子、挪溜子、顶板管理等先进经验纷纷搭配成套，推广了许多先进经验，使采煤工作面的各个工种、各个工序的工作全面得到提高。
    为了实现攉煤机械化，在党的领导下，各部门冲破了工种之间、单位之间的界限，生产、机电、供应等部门的职工，都团结一致，拧成一股绳，加紧赶制攉煤机。十二厂在攉煤机成功的鼓舞下，为了解决放炮问题，积极地用土法试制成功了毫秒雷管，而且迅速地由日产三百发提高到日产万发。辅助部门过去是“坐门等客”，现在是深入现场，主动配合。各单位都主动把别人的任务看成是自己的任务，把别人的困难当作自己的困难。这种把“方便让给别人，困难留给自己”的共产主义风格是极为可贵的。大跃进需要大协作来保证，技术革新和技术革命也不能缺少大协作，特别是需要机电部门和科学研究部门与生产部门紧密配合，拧成一根绳。我们把全市煤、电、运输、地方工业等部门，以及各个服务部门组织成大协作，互相帮助，互相保证。这是企业团结协作在技术革新、技术革命群众运动中的新发展。
    阜新矿区的攉煤机械化运动，由于时间还短，攉煤机械还不能说是尽善尽美，其他生产环节和管理工作还未能紧紧跟上；另一方面，我市有些企业的设备利用率不够高，不少生产过程仍然是体力劳动。因此，我们绝不能松劲自满，必须乘胜猛进，进一步加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，继续大鼓干劲，实现今年的继续跃进。
