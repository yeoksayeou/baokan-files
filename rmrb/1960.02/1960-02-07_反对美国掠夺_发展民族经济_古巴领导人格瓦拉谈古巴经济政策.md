Xinhua News Agency, Havana, February 5th. One of the leaders of the Cuban Rebel Army, and President of the National Bank, Che Guevara, gave an important speech on television on the 4th evening regarding the nation’s industrial development and the government’s economic policies. Guevara said that the Cuban government reserves the right to invest in all basic industries and to lead non-basic industries. The government opposes free enterprise because free enterprise resulted in Cuba losing 450 million in foreign exchange in seven years.

Guevara pointed out that private industrialists can cooperate with the revolutionary government's plans in industrial sectors that are beneficial and necessary to the people. However, all industries must be subject to government leadership, and they cannot be allowed to invest in basic industries. Whoever controls steel controls the country.

Guevara pointed out that foreign investment under past conditions was a good deal for investors but a bad deal for Cuba. He revealed that the concession laws for the Moa Bay Mining Company and the Nicaro Nickel Company in Cuba were drafted by the American Embassy and then handed over to the Cuban government, which is evidenced by archived letters. These two American companies took away Cuba's minerals without paying even the minimum tax to the Cuban state.

Guevara announced that the Industrial Development Bank would be transferred to the National Institute of Agrarian Reform as an affiliated institution, and loans allocated to economic development this year would increase by 10% compared to last year. He said that so far, the Industrial Department of the National Institute of Agrarian Reform has taken control of 41 industrial enterprises, with an investment of $1,552,000. He pointed out that the 4% wage contribution from workers for industrialization will reach 40 million pesos, which will only be used to establish state-owned industries, and workers will have the right to speak and vote on the leadership committees of the newly built state-owned enterprises. He assured that everyone would have a job, and unemployed workers would be transferred to work in the newly built industrial sectors.

Speaking of trade policy, Guevara said that an economy with open doors to the United States is a colonial-era economy, and maintaining this economy will not create the preconditions for developing Cuban industry.

The United States advocates an open-door economy in Cuba, but it does not implement this policy in its own territory. He said that more than 90% of the Cuban people agree with our policy, which is to protect foreign exchange so that our national industry can compete with foreign products and trade with countries around the world. He continued, Cuba will save $100 million in foreign exchange this year to purchase necessary industrial materials. Import controls will continue until Cuba has developed production and has extensive and diversified trade. This could be two, three, or five years. He condemned that many importers often act with malicious intent, hoarding their goods to raise prices. If mild measures do not work, if they continue to sabotage, the government will monopolize foreign trade. We cannot allow speculation against the Cuban people. He said the government will establish a consolidated merchant fleet. The state will become a large entrepreneur, and it should engage in imports through its own merchant fleet.

Guevara finally announced that Cuba will not participate in the Inter-American Bank. He pointed out that because the United States controls 60% of the bank's shares, it effectively dominates the institution's economic policies. In order to obtain the right to loans, Cuba must invest $18 million. However, those who can obtain loans are American companies established in Cuba, such as the electric power company. He said that Cuba cannot hand over its dollars to let this bank decide who to lend to. Cuba should use all its foreign exchange to guarantee the welfare of Cuba.

    反对美国掠夺　发展民族经济
    古巴领导人格瓦拉谈古巴经济政策
    新华社哈瓦那5日电　古巴起义军领导人之一、国家银行行长格瓦拉4日晚在电视中就国家的工业发展和政府的经济政策发表了重要谈话。格瓦拉说，古巴政府保留对一切基础工业的投资权利和领导非基础工业的权利。政府反对自由企业，因为自由企业的结果是古巴在七年内损失了四亿五千万外汇。
    格瓦拉指出，私人工业家可以在对人民有利和必要的工业部门中与革命政府的计划进行合作。但是一切工业都得服从政府的领导，不能允许他们在基础工业中投资。谁掌握钢铁就是掌握了国家。
    格瓦拉指出，在过去的条件下进行的外国投资对投资家来说是一笔好交易，但对古巴来说却是坏交易。他揭露说，古巴给美国的莫亚湾矿业公司和尼卡罗镍公司的租让法律是由美国大使馆起草，再交给古巴政府的，这有档案信件作为证明。这两家美国公司夺走古巴的矿产，而连最低的赋税也不向古巴国家交纳。
    格瓦拉宣布说，工业开发银行将转为古巴土地改革全国委员会的附属机构，今年拨给经济发展的贷款将比去年增加10％。他说，到目前为止，土地改革全国委员会工业部已经掌握了四十一家工业企业，投资数为一百五十五万二千美元。他指出，工人为工业化献出工资4％的捐款将达四千万比索，这笔钱将仅用于建立国营工业，工人将在新建的国有企业的领导委员会中有发言权和投票权。他保证说，一切人都将有工作，失业工人将转移到新建的工业部门中去工作。
    格瓦拉在谈到贸易政策时说，对美国门户开放的经济是殖民时代的经济，保持这种经济就创造不了发展古巴工业的先决条件。
    美国在古巴宣扬门户开放的经济，但是它在本国领土并不执行这个政策。他说，90％多的古巴人民赞同我们的政策，这个政策就是保卫外汇，使我国国家工业能和外国的产品进行竞争，并和世界各国进行贸易。他接着说，古巴今年将节约一亿美元外汇用来购买工业用的必要物资。进口控制将一直继续到古巴发展了生产，有了广泛的和多样化的贸易时为止。这可以是二年、三年或者五年。他谴责说，许多进口商常常心怀恶意地进行活动，囤积他们的货物以抬高物价。假若温和手段没有结果的话，假若他们继续进行破坏的话，政府将垄断对外贸易。我们不能允许对古巴人民进行投机。他说，政府将建立一支巩固的商船队。国家将成为一个大企业主，它应该通过自己的商船队来从事输入。
    格瓦拉最后宣布，古巴不参加泛美银行。他指出，由于美国控制了60％的银行股票，它实际上支配着这个机构的经济政策。古巴为了取得贷款的权利，必需投资一千八百万美元。而能够取得贷款的却是那些建立在古巴的美国公司，如电力公司。他说，古巴不能交出自己的美元来让这家银行决定贷款给什么人。古巴应把所有的外汇用来保障古巴的福利。
