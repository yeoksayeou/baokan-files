On January 26th and 27th, audiences watched the performances with umbrellas and raincoats. Many people's clothes were soaked, but they all stayed until the last program was over before leaving.

At the request of the Burmese Ministry of Culture, the Chinese National Song and Dance Troupe gave two additional performances on February 1st and 2nd, in addition to the original five scheduled performances.
