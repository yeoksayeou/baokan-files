    On the Development of Quyi Music
    Lü Ji
    Having recently listened to the performance of excellent Quyi programs sponsored by the Ministry of Culture, I naturally thought of the National Quyi Performance sponsored by the Ministry of Culture and the Quyi Research Association in August two years ago. In terms of scale, this event was not as large as that one, but everyone had a common feeling that whether in terms of content or performance art, there had been great development compared to the previous performance. Some say that although Quyi has a history of over a thousand years, it has only truly gained youth after liberation. This statement correctly points out the face of Quyi development after liberation, which is also the conclusion everyone has reached after listening to these performances.
    I
    The vast majority of the programs in this report performance reflect real life, including those that depict revolutionary history. There are relatively few traditional programs. I think this is only because everyone hoped to hear opinions from all sides on the newly created programs, and did not bring out the traditional programs that everyone was good at in the past. It is definitely not because the importance of modern programs was emphasized, thus neglecting traditional programs. This makes us feel that in the future, we may as well hold thematic report performances separately in a planned way, so as not to be biased. Because how to reflect real life and how to sort out traditional Quyi programs have some meaningful questions that need to be organized for everyone to study together. In fact, the excavation of excellent traditional programs is still an extremely difficult task, and in Quyi art, it still needs all parties to carry out vigorously and in a planned way; for example, how to use the proletarian worldview and the viewpoint of historical materialism to evaluate and sort out traditional Quyi programs, how to use new technical conditions and new performance methods to express excellent traditional Quyi programs, so that these programs can better serve socialist construction, is still a new topic, and everyone still lacks in-depth discussion. If we organize thematic report performances, it will definitely promote everyone to conduct in-depth research on these issues, and gradually solve these problems, so that excellent traditional Quyi programs are more profound in educational significance and higher in artistry.
    II
    In many Quyi programs reflecting new life, the crosstalk work "Yesterday" (by Zhao Zhong, Chang Baohua, and Zhong Yibing) aroused a particularly strong response from the audience. This is because the authors did not first look for jokes in life from how to make the audience laugh; nor did they stiffly create jokes and force the audience to laugh; but the authors saw from the changes in the history of life, from the contrast between new and old life, the fundamental and inspiring change in the social system. The authors cleverly combined the different logic of new and old life on one event, essentially exposing the crimes created by the old social system, the suffering of the working people, and at the same time vividly and profoundly expressing the new social relations and new spiritual outlook of the working people; truly making us see that the cannibalistic old society is gone forever, and in the new society, the working people are no longer unemployed, no longer threatened by life, and are so concerned about each other. How can this not make people laugh happily! The audience laughed because they saw life changing from tragedy to comedy, and from the comedy event, they remembered countless tragedies in the past old society. Such laughter is of educational significance. Of course, I don't think that only this kind of laughter exists in life, there is also laughter caused by wit, laughter caused by humorous language and actions, laughter generated by victory over the enemy, and even laughter emitted due to strongly mocking one's own weaknesses; but I think the author of "Yesterday" has found a kind of laughter for crosstalk that has never been heard in history and has new aesthetic significance. In this way, a new road has been opened for crosstalk, making us see that crosstalk has truly embarked on the broad road of socialism. It can not only make the working people who are building socialism laugh, but also achieve the goal of educating the people with laughter that is rich in socialist ideological content. Along this road, many new programs can be created to replace the old crosstalk programs that can only cause meaningless or even low-level laughter. We want to laugh, and we need many meaningful laughs. Obviously, only the working people of our socialist country can laugh meaningfully, and can "laugh better" than people in any other country.
    III
    In many local Quyi programs, I have found that the performers and accompanists have paid great attention to music, and have strengthened the role of music more than in the past. First of all, it is necessary to mention the accompaniment. In the past, many local Quyi only used a few musical instruments for accompaniment, and some only used one Sanxian, like Sun Laikui's "Night Tour of Thousand Mu Fields" (Xihe Dagu) in this report performance. However, this time Sun Shuyun of the Central Broadcasting Rap Troupe sang Beijing Rhyme Dagu, and the accompaniment added Si Hu and Di Hu in addition to Sanxian. The Meihua Dagu of the Hebei Provincial Team added Si Hu in addition to Sanxian. The Pingtan of the Shanghai Municipal Team, when Liu Yunru sang "New Mulan Poem", added Erhu, Six-stringed Ruan, and Pengling in addition to the original Pipa and Xiao Sanxian. Tianjin Shidiao added Sheng in addition to Si Hu, Yangqin, Sanxian, and Di Erhu. Jilin Qinshu used three instruments such as Yangqin, Zhuihu, and Sanxian; Luan Qinshu used four instruments such as Yangqin, Banhu, Sanxian, and Erhu; Henan Sanxian Jiaozishu used Sanxian, Jiaozishu, Zhuqin, Erhu, and Octagonal Drum. Many other local Quyi also added one or several pieces to the original accompaniment instruments. Obviously, the increase of each instrument has been researched and selected. Overall, it is fuller, more colorful, and more expressive than the original accompaniment. From the current situation, the accompaniment instruments of various Quyi tend to be of one type, which cannot but cause the audience to worry whether it will weaken the musical uniqueness of each Quyi form. Many audiences believe that Quyi should also be like opera, and maintain its own uniqueness in the color of accompaniment instruments. Some audiences are also worried that due to the increase of accompaniment instruments, the original simple and convenient characteristics of Quyi will be greatly changed. I think these two issues are worth noting by Quyi musicians in various places. It is entirely possible for each Quyi to retain its own characteristics in the accompaniment, because we have a rich variety of instruments and can choose at will. The increase of instruments should not be too much, at least it should be able to increase and decrease. Some actors try to hand over the instruments they take (some are percussion instruments, drums, etc.) to the accompanists, which may not be appropriate. I fully agree with the comrades Bai Fengyan and Liang Xiaolou in the article "Research on Quyi Music" that "because the actors themselves master the instruments, the handling of rhythm is very active, and in grasping the specific emotions of the program content, it is also easier to give free play, making Quyi music more infectious. At the same time, it simplifies the performance form…".
    Of course, the more important performance of musical development lies in the reform of singing, the improvement and enhancement of performance art, and the strengthening and enrichment of accompaniment music.
    According to what everyone talked about at the symposium held by the Chinese Musicians Association and the Chinese Quyi Research Association, almost every actor and accompanist studied together and reformed the singing according to the content when singing new programs about new people and new things; they also absorbed other Quyi music, and even opera music, to enrich their own singing. Some Quyi, such as Meihua Dagu, boldly reformed the traditional principle of "70% instrument and 30% singing," deliberately strengthened the expressive ability of the singing, and also changed the gorgeous interludes that did not meet the requirements of the content to make them conform to the development of the plot. Sichuan Qingyin and Shanghai Pingtan paid special attention to reforming their singing, and strived to make it able to express the strong revolutionary will of new characters. These reforms are very important in the development of Quyi music. This truly strengthens the role of music in Quyi, making music—traditional singing accompaniment—more unified with the new content. This will inevitably strengthen the appeal of Quyi, and give a higher play to the positive role of music in Quyi. It is obvious that when Comrade Liang Xiaolou performed "The Good Daughter of the Party, Xu Xuehui" and Comrade Sun Shuyun performed "The Good Daughter of the Party, Xiang Xiuli", they not only developed the singing of Beijing Rhyme Dagu, making it have tunes that can better express heroic characters, but also developed the accompaniment. For example, when Comrade Liang Xiaolou sang the latter part, the use of staccato in the band accompaniment further enhanced the rendering of Xu Xuehui's strong revolutionary will to fight for the socialist motherland. The band accompanying Comrade Sun Shuyun, with the change of the singer's mood, the staccato turns were controlled very appropriately. Especially in expressing Xiang Xiuli's noble ideological qualities, and in expressing her many inner activities, the band made a more detailed portrayal, which made us see that the band and the performers had close cooperation, so it played a good auxiliary and supplementary role for the singing. The use of Pengling in the Pingtan "New Mulan Poem" is also creative, greatly strengthening the bright and cheerful atmosphere.
    Everyone has seen the achievements made by the Beijing Municipal Team and the Central Broadcasting Rap Troupe in singing the brand tune "Long Live Three Shouts" with seven or eight people. Although this is not a new attempt, the Shanghai Pingtan also had a four-person chorus of "The East Wind Absolutely Overwhelms the West Wind" at the 1958 Quyi Performance; in the past, there were occasional chorus forms in Quyi, but there were not so many people singing together; the most important thing is of course to suit the new content. In the past, a few people singing together was only an expansion of the number of singers, and the large number of people made people feel that it was not suitable for the content of the singing; but the themes of "The East Wind Absolutely Overwhelms the West Wind" and "Long Live Three Shouts", using the chorus form, appear more powerful and can better express the lofty aspirations of our people than the solo singing form. Of course, Quyi chorus can only be developed in the socialist era when there are larger Quyi troupes. This performance once again dispelled the superstition that many people believe that Quyi cannot be sung in chorus, and also opened up a new road for many engaged in music creation in the chorus genre, and also added a new variety to our chorus art. Although there are individual tunes that are not completely suitable in the selection of tunes this time, such as "Lianhua Luo", the overall effect of the program is still very good. Of course, solo singing should still be the main performance form of Quyi. Comrade Li Ling believes that new struggle life is not easy to highlight the image by relying on one or two people to sing, which is probably to measure Quyi by the scale of chorus! I think that the highlighting of the image depends on the ideological level and artistic level achieved by the creation and performance, not that a certain musical form can portray the image of struggle life, and another musical form is not suitable for portraying the image of struggle life. Quyi adopts the form of one or two people singing, which has its advantages in both the old and new societies. In the old society, it is easy to operate, and in the new society, it is easy to go deep into the fields, construction sites, mines, and workshops. Moreover, in narration and in portraying character images, it has formed its own unique and effective methods in the long-term practice. Of course, in expressing the new struggle life, it will continue to develop, especially after absorbing the advantages of other musical art forms, it will reach a higher level.
    Everyone has heard of Comrade Guo Wenqiu's efforts in developing Zhui Zi music. She has indeed come out of the original Zhui Zi music, making it more suitable for expressing new life. Undoubtedly, the musical content has become richer, and the ability to portray characters and express life has been enhanced. But some audiences also believe that she has also abandoned Qiao Qingxiu's beautiful tunes. This is indeed worth noting by Comrade Guo Wenqiu. We must see the limitations of Qiao Qingxiu's Zhui Zi tunes. Its tunes are relatively simple and cannot express complex emotional changes; but its advantages are also very obvious, bright and vivid, and infectious. How to both preserve and develop the advantages of Qiao Qingxiu's Zhui Zi music, while also enriching the expressive ability of Zhui Zi music, is still the arduous task of all our engaged in the reform and performance of Henan Zhui Zi music, especially for experienced and accomplished artists like Comrade Guo Wenqiu and others who have a greater responsibility. Generally speaking, beautiful tunes that have been honed over thousands of times in any Quyi should not be easily abandoned, but we must also have the courage to create and not be afraid of failure. Tan Xinpei's initial failure just made him finally successful in creating tunes. As long as we constantly examine our singing and music according to the content of new life, and constantly enrich and develop our singing and music according to the people's love, Quyi music will surely get better development and improvement, will gain higher expressiveness, and become a more perfect and unique musical genre.
    IV
    Perhaps in the past year or two, everyone has paid special attention to the reform of singing and interludes, so the application of "saying" and drums has been relatively relaxed. Therefore, some audiences feel that many Quyi have reduced the "saying" in this report performance, and the application of drums is even less. In addition to playing a section of opening drums at the beginning, there are very few interspersed in the middle. We think this is a problem worth noting by everyone, so we put forward some opinions on this issue for everyone to study.
    "Saying and singing" as a unique art form lies in the fact that it has both singing and saying. The plot of a story is often said, and sometimes sung; the description of the scene uses saying and singing; simple dialogues are often said but not sung, and longer dialogues are sometimes said and sometimes sung. In short, singing and saying are arranged according to the needs of the entire book and the habits of the audience, not mechanically. Appropriate arrangement can prevent the audience from getting tired and can always concentrate on listening. As for drums and other percussion instruments, they have many functions in the traditional programs of saying and singing; sometimes they are used for the conversion of emotions; sometimes they are used to strengthen the intensity of emotions; sometimes they can also be used to describe the sound effects of knocking on the door, hitting the table, autumn wind blowing leaves, thunder, and firing artillery; sometimes they can also be used as interludes to give the performers proper rest; sometimes they can also arouse the audience's attention; sometimes they can also strengthen the atmosphere; and sometimes they are used to strengthen the rhythm of the music. It can not only express the momentum of victory, but also describe the embarrassed situation of retreat. In short, in the hands of the performers, there are many uses. Proper use is a very useful tool. Unfortunately, in recent years, many performers have ignored the use of drums and other percussion instruments, thus weakening the expressive power of the saying and singing Quyi form. We believe that while developing and strengthening Quyi music, we must also pay attention to the use of "saying"; while developing and strengthening the accompaniment music of Quyi, we must also pay attention to giving play to the role of drums and other percussion instruments. It can be said that the development of Quyi music should also implement the policy of walking on two legs.
    V
    Many talented young actors have emerged in this excellent Quyi report performance, making us see that the older generation of Quyi artists have done many touching works in cultivating the younger generation. They selflessly and unreservedly educate the younger generation to grow up, and have achieved gratifying achievements, which is worth cheering for us. It is said that the training class attached to the Beijing Quyi Troupe is planning to be changed into a professional Quyi school, and Shanghai is also planning to open an institution to train young Pingtan actors, which are all exciting news. We believe that in the near future, under the leadership of the Party in various places, young Quyi artists with a high level of political ideology, a high level of culture, and a high level of artistic accomplishment will grow up in batches from these Quyi teaching institutions, and contribute their youth to the development of the new socialist Quyi art. The research work of Quyi will also be further developed with the development of these educational institutions.
    Finally, I cannot but say a few more words about the relationship between Quyi and music. Many musicians, after constantly approaching and learning Quyi in the ten years after liberation, have a deeper understanding of the rich and unique Quyi art, criticized various incorrect views on Quyi art, and acknowledged that Quyi is a genre of music art in our country with strong originality and rich expressiveness, and saw that Quyi art has a long history, a rich heritage, and each place has its own unique style; in the past half century, some outstanding actors such as Liu Baoquan, Bai Yunpeng, Liu Chunshan, and Qiao Qingxiu have emerged, who not only raised the Quyi performance art to a very high level, but also made many creations in Quyi music. Therefore, many people have seriously learned Quyi, and many soloists have further mastered the national style of singing art and improved their singing level due to learning Quyi; many composers have developed their musical creation due to seriously learning Quyi. But there are still many people (including composers, performers, and music theorists) who still have some wrong views on Quyi art, and even think that it is only a kind of recitation art, and do not admit that it is a unique genre in music art, so they have not given it due attention. It is undeniable that some forms of Quyi should not be included in the category of music art, such as crosstalk, Shandong Kuaishu, and Kuaiban, especially the former. Shandong Kuaishu and Kuaiban, as a form of recitation, even if it is not a musical form, still has a certain degree of musicality, which is worth learning. The performance art of Shandong Kuaishu and Kuaiban has many things that vocal singers can learn, which cannot be ignored by us. If the professional settings of our music colleges do not completely copy the old rules of foreign music colleges, and start from the actual situation of music in our country, Quyi singing can be listed as a major in the vocal music department, and the composition department can also include Quyi music writing as one of the teaching contents, and the national instrumental music department can also include Quyi music in the teaching. From the perspective of the need to develop Quyi art, the composition department's planned training of a certain number of cadres for the reform of Quyi music will have a significant meaning for the reform and development of Quyi music in the future. Therefore, we hope that some music educators who are determined to develop socialist and national new music culture will seriously consider these requirements, quickly take concrete measures, and do their part to develop Quyi music in our country with a long history, a rich heritage, and a unique style! In the past few years, especially in the Great Leap Forward movement in 1958, after the music colleges further carried out teaching reforms and emphasized the nationalization of music teaching, some vocal music students in music colleges began to learn some Quyi and have achieved some results. However, because the wrong ideas have not been completely eliminated, the minds have not been completely liberated, and some superstitions have not been completely broken, the learning of Quyi has not been further developed, and some colleges have not yet included Quyi in the teaching plan. We sincerely hope that all music colleges will open its doors to Quyi music as soon as possible! Let Quyi music "return" to those music colleges that do not study Quyi as soon as possible, receive due training, and have the conditions for development and growth like other musical forms! Some music performance groups should also welcome Quyi to "return" and become a member of that big family. On the one hand, singers can learn from Quyi actors, and on the other hand, they can also help Quyi actors develop new socialist Quyi. On the other hand, it can also enrich our performance forms and further expand the connection between our performance groups and the broad working people! Because Quyi has a close relationship with the broad masses of the people. Let the socialist music education and music performance careers further implement the Party's "let a hundred flowers bloom" policy!

    论曲艺音乐的发展
    吕骥
    最近听了文化部主办的曲艺优秀节目汇报演出，自然就想起了前年8月间文化部和曲艺研究会所主办的全国曲艺会演，从规模来说，这次不如那次大，但大家都有一个共同的感觉，无论在内容上或表演艺术上，比上次会演都有了很大的发展。有人说，曲艺虽然有了千多年的历史，但直到解放后才真正获得了青春。这句话正确地指出了解放后曲艺发展的面貌，也正是大家听了这几次演出所得到的结论。
    一
    这次汇报演出，绝大部分是反映现实生活的作品，其中也包括了写革命历史的。传统的节目比较少。我想这只是由于大家都希望听到各方面对新创作的节目的意见，才没有把大家过去擅长的传统节目拿出来，决不是因为强调了现代节目的重要性因而忽略了传统节目。这里使我们觉得以后不妨有计划地分别举行专题汇报演出，以免偏废。因为如何反映现实生活和如何整理曲艺传统节目，同样有一些有意义的问题，需要组织大家共同研究。事实上，优秀的传统节目的发掘，还是一个极其艰巨的工作，在曲艺艺术中还需要各方面大力有计划地进行；比方如何运用无产阶级的世界观和历史唯物论的观点去评价整理传统曲艺节目，如何运用新的技术条件和新的表演方法去表现优秀的传统曲艺节目，使这些节目更好地为社会主义建设服务，还是一个新的课题，大家还缺乏深入的探讨。如果组织专题汇报演出，一定会推动大家对这些问题展开深入研究，逐步去解决这些问题，使得优秀的传统曲艺节目更富有深刻的教育意义和更高的艺术性。
    二
    在许多反映新生活的曲艺节目中，“昨天”（赵忠、常宝华、钟艺兵作）这部相声作品引起了听众特别强烈的反应，这是因为作者不是首先从如何引起听众发笑而去从生活中寻找笑料；更不是生硬地制造笑料，强迫听众发笑；而是作者以新的观点从生活历史变化中，从新旧生活的对比中，看到了根本性的令人欢欣鼓舞的社会制度的改变，作者巧妙地把新旧生活不同的逻辑结合在一个事件上，本质地揭露了旧社会制度所制造的罪恶，劳动人民的痛苦，同时又生动地深刻地表现了劳动人民新的社会关系和新的精神面貌；真正使我们看到了吃人的旧社会一去不复返了，而新社会中，劳动人民不再失业，不再受到生活的威胁，而且互相之间那样地互相关切。这样，怎能不使人欣然而笑呢！听众笑，是因为看到了生活由悲剧而转为喜剧，从喜剧的事件中又想起了过去旧社会中的无数悲剧。这样的笑是富有教育意义的。当然，我不以为生活中只有这种笑的存在，还有由于机智而引起的笑，由于诙谐语言和行动而引起的笑，对于敌人的胜利而产生的笑，甚至于由于强烈地嘲讽了自己的弱点而发出的笑；但我以为“昨天”的作者为相声找到了一种历史上从来没有听见过的、具有新的美学意义的笑。这样，就为相声开辟了一条新的道路，使我们看到了相声真正走上了社会主义的康庄大道，它不仅能够使建设社会主义的劳动人民笑，     而且达到了以富有社会主义思想内容的笑来教育人民。沿着这条道路，就可以创造许多新的节目，代替那些只能引起毫无意义的、甚至于是低级的笑的旧的相声节目了。我们要笑，而且需要许多有意义的笑。很显然，只有我们社会主义国家的劳动人民才能有意义地笑，才能比任何别的国家的人“笑得更好”。
    三
    在许多地方曲艺节目里，我发现演员和伴奏者对于音乐都付予了极大的注意，而且比较过去，更加强了音乐的作用。首先要提到伴奏，过去，许多地方的曲艺只用很少的乐器伴奏，有的只用一个三弦，像这次汇报演出中孙来奎同志表演的“夜逛千亩田”（西河大鼓）那样，可是这次中央广播说唱团孙书筠唱的京韵大鼓，伴奏除三弦外，还加了四胡和低胡，河北省代表队的梅花大鼓除三弦外，还加了四胡。上海市代表队的评弹，刘韵若同志唱“新木兰辞”时，除原来的琵琶和小三弦以外，还加了二胡、四弦阮和碰铃。天津时调除了四胡、洋琴、三弦、低二胡之外，还加了笙。吉林琴书用了洋琴、坠胡和三弦等三件乐器；潞安琴书用了洋琴、板胡、三弦和二胡等四件乐器；河南的三弦铰子书用了三弦、铰子、坠琴、二胡和八角鼓。其他许多地方曲艺也都就原来的伴奏乐器加了一件或几件。显然，每种乐器的增加，都是经过研究和挑选的。总的看起来，都比原来的伴奏更丰满、更富于色彩、更富于表现力。从目前的情况看，各种曲艺的伴奏乐器有趋于一种类型的倾向，这不能不引起听众产生一种忧虑，会不会减弱了每一种曲艺形式的音乐的独特性？有许多听众都认为曲艺也应当像戏曲那样，在伴奏乐器色彩上要保持自己的独特性，也还有一些听众耽忧，由于伴奏乐器的增加，要大大改变曲艺原来的简单、轻便的特点。我以为这两个问题都是值得各地曲艺音乐工作者注意的。每种曲艺应该在伴奏上保有自己的特点，这是完全可能的，因我们乐器种类丰富，可以任意挑选。乐器的增加不可太多，至少要做到能增能减，有的地方的演员尝试把自己拿的乐器（有的是节奏乐器，鼓板之类）交给伴奏者，这样做也未必是适宜的。我完全同意白凤岩、良小楼等同志在“曲艺音乐研究”一文中所指出的，“由于演员自己掌握乐器，对节奏的处理就很主动，而在掌握节目内容的特定感情方面，也更便于自由发挥，使曲艺音乐更富有感染力。同时也简化了演出形式……”。
    当然，音乐上的发展，更重要的表演在唱腔的改革、表演艺术的改进与提高、伴奏音乐的加强与丰富等方面。
    根据大家在中国音乐家协会和中国曲艺研究会召开的座谈会上所谈到的，几乎每一个演员在演唱新人新事的节目时，都和伴奏者一同研究，根据内容，改革了唱腔；也都吸取了其他曲艺音乐，甚至于歌剧音乐，以丰富自己的唱腔。有些曲艺，如梅花大鼓，大胆改革了“七分乐器三分唱”的传统原则，着意加强了唱腔的表现能力，并且对不适应内容要求的华丽的过门也改得使它符合情节的发展。四川清音、上海评弹特别注意到改革自己的唱腔，努力使它能够表现新人物的坚强的革命意志。这些改革在曲艺音乐的发展上都是十分重要的。这样真正加强了音乐在曲艺中的作用，使音乐——传统的唱腔伴奏，和新的内容更加统一。这就必然加强了曲艺的感染力，更高地发挥了音乐在曲艺中的积极作用。很明显，像良小楼同志表演“党的好女儿徐学惠”，孙书筠同志表演“党的好女儿向秀丽”的时候，不仅把京韵大鼓的唱腔发展了，具有了更能表现英雄人物的曲调，同时也发展了伴奏。比方良小楼同志唱到后段，乐队伴奏上顿音的使用，更增强了对徐学惠为社会主义祖国而斗争的坚强革命意志的渲染。为孙书筠同志伴奏的乐队，随着演唱者的情绪的变化，顿挫转折控制得很适当，特别在表现向秀丽的崇高的思想品质上，在表现她的许多内心活动的时候，乐队作了比较细致的刻画，这里使我们看到乐队和表演者有着密切的合作，因此对于演唱起了良好的辅助、补充作用。评弹“新木兰辞”中碰铃的使用，也是有创造性的，大大加强了明朗、欢快的气氛。
    大家都看到北京市代表队和中央广播说唱团七、八人齐唱牌子曲“三呼万岁”所获得的成就，这虽然并不算新的尝试，1958年曲艺会演时，上海评弹也曾有过四人齐唱的“东风绝对压西风”；过去曲艺中偶然也有过齐唱的形式，却没有这么多的人一起齐唱；最重要的当然还是适合新的内容。过去几个人齐唱，仅仅只是演唱人数的扩大，人多反而使人觉得不适合演唱的内容；可是“东风绝对压西风”、
  “三呼万岁”这样的题材，用齐唱形式，就显得比独唱更有气势，更能表现我国人民的雄图壮志。当然，曲艺齐唱只有在社会主义时代，有了规模较大的曲艺团才有发展的可能。这一次的表演，又一次破除了许多人认为曲艺不可能齐唱的迷信，也为许多从事音乐创作的在齐唱体裁上打开了一条新的道路，也在我们的合唱艺术中增加了一个新的品种。虽然这次在曲调选择上还有个别曲子，如“莲花落”不完全适合，但整个节目的效果还是很好的。当然，独唱还应当是曲艺的主要表演形式。李凌同志认为新的斗争生活单靠一两人说唱，形象不易突出，那大概是以合唱的尺度来衡量曲艺吧！我以为形象的突出是依赖于创作和表演所达到的思想水平和艺术水平，不是说某种音乐形式可以刻划斗争生活形象，另一种音乐形式不适合刻划斗争生活形象。曲艺采取一两人说唱形式，无论在旧社会、新社会都有其优越性，在旧社会便于经营，在新社会便于深入田头、工地、矿井和车间，而且无论在叙事、在刻划人物形象上，已经在长期的实践中，形成了自己独特的、有效的手法，当然在表现新的斗争生活中还会不断地发展，特别是吸取了其他音乐艺术形式的优点以后，会达到更高的水平。
    大家都听到郭文秋同志在发展坠子音乐上所作的努力，她的确从原来的坠子音乐中走了出来，使它更适合于表现新生活，无疑地，在音乐内容上更丰富了，刻划人物，表现生活的能力都增强了。但也有些听众认为她同时也抛弃了乔清秀的优美的曲调。这的确是值得郭文秋同志注意的。我们必须看到乔清秀的坠子曲调的局限性，它的曲调比较单纯，不能表现复杂的情绪变化；但它的优点也是很明显的，明丽而形象鲜明，富于感染力。如何既保存了又发展了乔清秀派的坠子音乐的优点，同时又丰富了坠子音乐的表现能力，这还是我们所有从事河南坠子音乐改革和表演家的艰巨任务，特别是像郭文秋同志和其他一些有经验、有修养的艺术家有更大的责任。一般说，任何曲艺中经过千锤百炼的优美的曲调都不宜轻易抛弃，但我们也要有创造的勇气，不要害怕失败，谭鑫培最初的失败，正好使他最后在创腔上获得了成功。只要我们不断地根据新生活内容去审查我们的唱腔和音乐，不断地根据人民的喜爱去丰富、发展我们的唱腔和音乐，曲艺音乐一定会得到更好的发展和提高，会获得更高的表现力，成为一种更为完美的独特的音乐体裁。
    四
    也许近一两年来大家特别注意了唱腔和过门的改革，因此相对地对于说和鼓的应用就放松了，所以有些听众，觉得在这次汇报演出中许多曲艺都减少了说，至于鼓的应用就更少了，除了开始打了一段开场鼓之外，中间就很少插用。我们认为这是值得大家注意的问题，特就这个问题提出点意见和大家研究。
    “说唱”作为一种独特的艺术形式，就在于它既有唱，又有说，叙述一个故事的情节，常是说，有时也唱；描写情景用说，也用唱；简单的对话常是说而不唱，较长的对话有时说，也有时唱。总之，唱和说，就整段书的需要和听众的习惯而安排，不是机械的。适当的安排就可以使听众不致于疲劳，始终能够聚精会神地听。至于鼓和其他打击乐器，在说唱传统节目中有多方面的作用；有时用作情绪的转换；有时用来加强情绪的强度；有时也可以用作描写敲门、击桌、秋风吹落叶、雷鸣、发炮的音响效果；有时又可以用作过门，使表演者得到适当的休息；有时又可以唤起听众的注意；有时还可以加强气氛；有时又用以加强音乐的节奏。既可表现胜利的声势，也可描写败退的狼狈情景。总之，在表演者手中有许多的用途，运用得法，是一个极有用的工具，可惜近几年来许多表演者忽视了鼓和其他打击乐器的运用，因此减弱了说唱曲艺形式的表现力量，我们以为在发展、加强曲艺音乐的同时，必须同时注意运用说；在发展加强曲艺的伴奏音乐的同时，必须同时注意发挥鼓和其他打击乐器的作用。可以说，发展曲艺音乐也应该贯彻两条腿走路的方针。

    这次优秀曲艺汇报演出中涌现了许多年青的有才华的青年演员，使我们看到老一辈曲艺艺术家在培养年轻的一代做了许多令人感动的工作，他们忘我地、无私地教育年青的一辈成长，已经获得令人欢喜的成就，这是值得我们欢呼的。听说北京市曲艺团附设的训练班正在计划改成专业的曲艺学校，上海市也正在计划开办培养评弹青年演员的机构，这都是令人兴奋的消息。我们相信不久的将来，在各地党的领导下，年轻的、有高度政治思想水平、有高度文化水平、有高度艺术修养的曲艺艺术家会成批地从这些曲艺教学机构中成长起来，为发展社会主义的新曲艺艺术而贡献他们的青春。曲艺的研究工作也将会随着这些教育机构的发展而获得进一步的开展。
    最后，我不能不就曲艺和音乐的关系再说几句话，许多音乐工作者经过解放后十年来不断地接近、学习曲艺，对丰富的、独特的曲艺艺术有了较深的了解，批判了各种对曲艺艺术不正确的看法，承认了曲艺是我国音乐艺术中独创性很强、表现力很丰富的一种体裁，而且看到了曲艺艺术有悠久的历史、有丰富的遗产，各地曲艺都有自己独特的风格；近半世纪中，就曾经产生了像刘宝全、白云鹏、刘春山、乔清秀这样一些卓越的演员，他们不仅把曲艺表演艺术提到了很高的水平，在曲艺音乐上也有很多创造。因此，许多人曾经认真地学习了曲艺，有许多独唱家由于学习曲艺进一步掌握了演唱艺术的民族风格，提高了自己的演唱水平；有许多作曲家由于认真学习了曲艺，发展了自己的音乐创作。但也还有许多人（包括作曲家、表演家和音乐理论家）对曲艺艺术还存在一些错误观点，甚至认为它只是一种朗诵艺术，而不承认它是音乐艺术中的一种独特的体裁，因此没有予以应有的重视。不可否认，曲艺中有些形式是不应该列入音乐艺术范畴的，如相声、山东快书、快板，特别是前者。山东快书、快板作为一种朗诵形式，即使不是音乐形式，也仍然有一定程度的音乐性，值得我们学习。山东快书、快板的表演艺术对于声乐演唱者更有许多可以学习的东西，是不容我们忽视的。如果我们的音乐院校的专业设置不完全抄袭外国音乐院校的陈规，从我国音乐实际出发的话，曲艺演唱是可以作为一个专业列入声乐系的，作曲系也可以把曲艺音乐写作作为教学内容之一，民族器乐系也可以将曲艺音乐列入教学。从发展曲艺艺术的需要来看，作曲系有计划地为曲艺音乐改革培养一定数量的干部，将来对曲艺音乐的改革和发展是有重大意义的。因此，我们希望一些有志于发展社会主义的、民族的新音乐文化的音乐教育家认真地考虑这些要求，迅速地采取具体措施，为发展我国具有悠久历史、有着丰富的遗产、独具风格的曲艺音乐而尽一臂之力！过去几年中，特别是1958年大跃进运动中，各音乐院校进一步进行教学改革，强调音乐教学民族化以后，有些音乐院校声乐系学生开始学习某种曲艺，并且已经取得一些成绩。但由于错误思想未彻底肃清，思想未彻底解放，某些迷信未彻底破除，曲艺的学习还没有得到进一步的发展，有些院校至今也未把曲艺列入教学计划中。我们诚恳地希望各音乐院校早日向曲艺音乐打开它的大门！让曲艺音乐早日“回到”那些不学曲艺的音乐院校去，受到应有的培养，和其他音乐形式一样得到发展、成长的条件！某些音乐表演团体也应该欢迎曲艺“回去”，成为那个大家庭中的一员，一方面演唱者可以向曲艺演员学习，一方面也可以帮助曲艺演员发展社会主义的新曲艺，另一方面也还可以丰富我们的表演形式，进一步扩大我们表演团体和广大劳动人民的联系！因为曲艺和广大人民群众是有密切联系的。让社会主义的音乐教育事业和音乐表演事业进一步贯彻党的“百花齐放”的方针吧！
