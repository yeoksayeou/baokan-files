Academic and Cultural Trends

    New Soviet Research on Oxygen Ions
    Soviet scholars have recently conducted new research on oxygen anions in the air. According to this research, ultraviolet rays from sunlight, cosmic rays, the respiratory process of chlorophyll in the plant kingdom, waterfalls, and sea waves generate oxygen anions in nature, while urban dust and emissions from factories and automobiles reduce the content of oxygen anions in the air. Soviet scholars have demonstrated the effect of oxygen anions on life through experiments on white mice. That is, putting white mice into an airtight box lacking oxygen, inputting ionized air can restore their life, while inputting ordinary air cannot save them. Therefore, air recuperation at the seaside and in the mountains can improve blood condition, lower blood pressure for those with excessive mental stress, and strengthen the nervous system, while long-term residence in cities can easily lead to fatigue, headaches, and dizziness. In addition, Soviet scholars have also proven that oxygen anions in the air can remove harmful microorganisms and dust from the air.
    In order to promote air ion therapy, the Soviet Union has produced a device for artificially generating oxygen anions. The device consists of a tube leading into a water-filled container, with a motor at the end of the tube and a rotating impeller at the bottom. Starting the motor will spray out a fine mist. Inhaling this fine mist has significant effects in treating high blood pressure, asthma, and coughs.

    Tianjin Analyzes Tumor Data
    The Pathological Anatomy Teaching and Research Group of Tianjin Medical University, the Neurological Surgery Pathology Laboratory and Ophthalmology Pathology Laboratory of the Affiliated Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, the Pathological Anatomy Teaching and Research Group of Tianjin Medical College, Tianjin First Central Hospital, Second Central Hospital, Central Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, First Tuberculosis Hospital, Xinhua Hospital, Railway Hospital, 254 Hospital, People's Hospital, and the Blood Transfusion and Hematology Institute of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, a total of thirteen units, recently conducted a statistical analysis of 34,460 tumor cases examined by various pathology laboratories since the founding of the country ten years ago.
    Benign tumors accounted for 51.91% in this statistic, which is higher than figures from some other regions. This is related to the inclusion of some non-true tumors into benign tumors in this statistic. However, even excluding this portion, benign tumors would still account for 47.56% in this statistic, which is still relatively high.
    Among malignant tumors, carcinoma was the most common. Carcinoma accounted for 85.99% in this statistic, which is close to figures from some other regions. In this group of carcinomas, there were more females than males, with a ratio of approximately 2.4 to 1. Other malignant tumors accounted for slightly more than 14% in total. Among carcinomas, squamous cell carcinoma was the most common, accounting for 66.46% in this statistic. This is similar to figures from some other regions in North China (Beijing, Shanxi) and differs greatly from figures in Shanghai. This indicates that the sites of predilection for carcinomas vary in different regions.
    The most common sites for malignant tumors, in descending order, according to this statistic, are cervix, breast, esophagus, nose, nasopharynx, stomach, and oral cavity. Cervical cancer and breast cancer are in the forefront in statistics from some other regions. It seems that the incidence of cervical cancer is the highest in China, followed by breast cancer. As for the incidence of other malignant tumors, there are certain differences between this statistic and statistics from some other regions. This is because the climate and living habits vary in different regions, the statistics of each unit may be affected to some extent by the professional work of the relevant hospitals, and the statistics of each unit are affected to some extent by whether the lesions are superficial or deep-seated, etc.

　  The Soviet Union Develops Medicinal Plastic Glue
    Wounds from injuries and surgeries often become infected due to the intrusion of bacteria. The Soviet Union has recently developed a special synthetic resin alcohol solution – plastic glue "BF-6." When this solution is applied to a wound, it can quickly form a thin film, preventing bacteria from entering and thus enabling early wound healing. This film is very strong, elastic, and can last for two to four days, and will not fall off even when washed with soapy water.

    苏联对氧离子的新研究
    苏联学者近年来对空气中氧的阴离子进行了新的研究。根据这个研究，日光的紫外线、宇宙线、植物界叶绿素的呼吸过程、瀑布和海浪激起的水沫会产生自然界氧的阴离子，而城市的尘土和工厂、汽车放出的气体会减少空气中氧的阴离子的含量。苏联学者用其对白鼠的试验，证明了氧的阴离子对生命的作用。即：把白鼠投入缺氧的密闭小盒中，输入离子化的空气能使它恢复生命，而输入普通的空气则不能把它救活。因此，在海滨和山中进行空气疗养能够改善血液情况、降低精神过度紧张者的血压和强健神经系统等，而久居城市则容易产生疲劳、头痛和头晕等。此外，苏联学者还证明，空气中氧的阴离子能够清除空气中有害的微生物和尘土。
    为了推广空气离子疗法，苏联制成了一种人造氧的阴离子的器械。这种器械的装置是：以一根管子通进一个充水的容器，管端有一马达，管底有一旋转叶轮，开动马达就会喷出细雾。吸入这种细雾对治疗高血压、哮喘和咳嗽等，有显著的效果。
    天津市分析肿瘤资料
    天津医科大学病理解剖教研组、天津医科大学附属医院脑系外科病理室和眼科病理室、天津医学院病理解剖教研组、天津市第一中心医院、第二中心医院、中心妇产科医院、第一结核病院、新华医院、铁路医院、254医院、人民医院及中国医学科学院输血及血液病研究所等十三个单位，不久以前把各病理室自建国十年以来所检查的肿瘤资料三万四千四百六十例，加以统计分析。
    良性肿瘤在本统计中占了51．91％，比其他一些地区的数字为高。这与本统计把一部分并非真性肿瘤归入良性肿瘤有关。但是，就是除去这一部分，良性肿瘤在本统计中也将占47．56％，仍是比较高的。
    恶性肿瘤以癌瘤为最多。癌瘤在本统计中占85．99％，与其他一些地区的数字接近。本组癌瘤女多于男，其比数约为二点四比一。其他恶性肿瘤总共占14％强。癌瘤中，以鳞状上皮癌为最多，在本统计中占66．46％。这与华北其他一些地区（北京、山西）的数字相近，与上海的数字相差较远。这说明各地区的癌瘤好发部位有所不同。
    恶性肿瘤的好发部位按次序排列，本统计为宫颈、乳腺、食管、鼻、鼻咽、胃及口腔等。宫颈癌和乳腺癌在其他一些地区的统计中都在前列。看来，我国恶性肿瘤的发病率以宫颈癌为最高，乳癌次之。至于其他恶性肿瘤发病率，则本统计与其他一些地区的统计有一定差别。这是因为，各地区的气候和生活习惯不同，各单位的统计可能在一定程度上受有关医院专业工作的影响，各单位的统计都在一定程度上受病变的浅在或深在的影响，等等。　　
　  苏联制成药用塑料胶
    受伤和开刀后的创口，往往会因细菌的侵入而化脓。苏联新近制成了一种特殊的合成树脂的酒精溶液——塑料胶“BФ—6”。这种溶液被涂于创口，能够迅速结成一层薄膜，使细菌无法侵入，因而可以使伤口早期愈合。这种薄膜非常坚固，富有弹性，可以保持二——四天，即使以肥皂水洗涤也不会脱落。
