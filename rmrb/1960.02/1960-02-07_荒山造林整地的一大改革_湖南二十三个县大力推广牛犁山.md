A major reform in afforestation land preparation

Twenty-three counties in Hunan vigorously promote ox-plowing mountains

In the midst of the busy winter and spring agricultural and forestry production upsurge, in order to solve the difficulty of insufficient labor for afforestation land preparation, Hunan Province has successfully tested and vigorously promoted the method of using oxen to plow barren mountains to prepare forest land, which can greatly improve labor productivity.

Land preparation before afforestation, especially barren mountain land preparation, is the most arduous and labor-intensive part of the afforestation process, and it is also an important factor determining the survival rate of afforestation. Historically, all regions have adopted the cumbersome manual labor of digging mountains one hoe at a time. This method is both labor-intensive and inefficient.

In the afforestation last winter, the masses in Xupu, Fenghuang and other counties in Hunan Province boldly adopted the ox-plows used in agricultural production for barren mountain afforestation land preparation, and the results were good. According to the Dongfeng Forest Farm of Liaojiaqiao Commune in Fenghuang County, using ox-plowing to prepare land can allow one person to prepare 1.2 to 1.5 mu of land per day, which is four to five times more efficient than manual labor, which can only prepare 0.2 to 0.3 mu per person per day, and the quality of land preparation is better than manual digging. Their experience proves that this is a good way to solve the shortage of labor for afforestation land preparation in mountainous areas of southern China.

Ox-plowing mountains are not only suitable for barren mountain afforestation land preparation, but also for reclaiming and cultivating oil-tea mountains and tung-oil mountains. According to the experience of farmers in western Hunan, this method can be used not only on gentle slopes, but also on mountains with gravel and slopes of less than 20 degrees. According to experiments here, ox-plowing mountains can not only cultivate and loosen the soil, but also reclaim barren land. Generally, two to three mu of tea or tung-oil mountain can be plowed per day, and even barren land with hard soil can be plowed for one mu, which is at least three times higher than manual reclamation. According to calculations, if all of the existing seven million mu of mature oil-tea mountains in Hunan Province are plowed once with oxen, it would only require more than 200 workdays. This can greatly save labor for the intensive cultivation of oil-tea and tung-oil mountains or invest in other production, reducing the contradiction between agricultural and forestry seasonal labor.

Twenty-three counties in Hunan are now promoting the experience of using ox-plowing mountains for afforestation land preparation and reclaiming oil-tea mountains, and are running training courses in Shouche Commune, Yongshun County, which has the most experience in operating ox-plowing mountains, to impart ox-plowing mountain technology.

    荒山造林整地的一大改革
    湖南二十三个县大力推广牛犁山
    在繁忙的冬春农林生产高潮中，为了解决造林整地劳力不足的困难，湖南省试验成功并大力推广了能够大大提高劳动生产率的牛犁荒山的整理林地的办法。
    造林前的整地工作特别是荒山整地工作，是造林工序中最繁重，花工最大的一项，而且也是决定造林成活率高低的重要因素。历来各地都是采取人工用锄头一锄一锄挖山的笨重的手工劳动来进行。这样做，劳动强度既大，生产效率又低。
    在去冬造林中，湖南省溆浦、凤凰等县群众在造林整地中大胆采用了用于农业生产上的牛犁来进行荒山造林整地，结果效果良好。据凤凰县廖家桥公社东风林场试验，用牛犁山整地，一人一天可整地一点二至一点五亩，比人工每人每日整地二、三分提高效率四、五倍，而且整地质量比人工挖的好。他们的经验证明，这是解决南方地区山地造林整地劳力不足的一个好办法。
    牛犁山不仅适用于荒山造林整地，而且适用于垦复和抚育油茶山、油桐山。根据湘西农民的经验，不仅在缓坡山地可以用这种办法，就是在有碎石的二十度以下的山地，用它也能操纵自如。据这里试验，用牛犁山，既可以中耕松土，又可以垦修子荒，一般每日可犁茶山或桐山二至三亩，就是土质较硬的子荒也能犁一亩，比人工垦复至少要高三倍。根据计算，湖南全省现有的七百多万亩油茶熟山，全部用牛犁一遍，只需要两百多个工。这样就可以大大节省出劳力来对油茶、油桐山进行精细培育或投入其它生产，减少农林在季节用工上的矛盾。
    湖南现有二十三个县正在推广牛犁山造林整地和垦复油茶山的经验，并在操牛犁山经验最丰富的永顺县首车公社开办训练班，传授牛犁山技术。
