    Shanxi Establishes Production Bases to Expand Hemp Cultivation
    Zhejiang Actively Prepares for Plowing to Strive for High Yields of Jute

    (Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 13th dispatch) Shanxi Province is establishing hemp production bases in twelve counties and cities in the Jin Southeast, Jin Central, and Jin North regions, which are abundant in hemp production. According to the requirements of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, each base has uniformly planned land and adopted the method of "new hemp fields joining the ranks, old hemp fields returning to the team," establishing 400,000 mu of hemp production bases, an expansion of 57% compared to last year's planting area.

    Shanxi Province has a long history of hemp production, especially "Lu Hemp," which enjoys a long-standing reputation. These hemp crops have seen great development in recent years. In order to meet the needs of the high-speed development of the national economy for hemp, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently made a decision on expanding hemp field production. It requires that the per-mu yield of hemp in the province be doubled compared to last year, reaching 120 jin, and the total output be increased by two times compared to last year.

    The Jin Southeast region carried out extensive publicity among cadres and the masses in the hemp-growing areas, making the important significance of hemp production to the development of the national economy known to every household. Then, it held an on-site meeting in the Nan Cheng management area of the Han Dian Commune in Changzhi City, summarizing the experience of this management area in achieving a per-mu yield of 150 jin in new hemp fields, strengthening the masses' confidence in growing hemp. The per-mu yield target for the entire region's 181,100 mu of hemp fields was raised from 150 jin to 170 jin, doubling the actual per-mu yield in 1959, with a total output increase of three times. After fully mobilizing the masses to establish hemp production bases, the Jin North region will expand the hemp planting area by 9.28% compared to last year, increase the per-mu yield target by 57%, and increase the total output target by more than two times. These targets have been implemented at the production team level.

    The movement to ensure a bumper harvest of hemp has been launched with in-depth ideological mobilization. Major hemp production bases throughout the province are carrying out a hemp field preparation movement centered on 10,000-mu high-yield plots, 1,000-mu high-yield plots, and 100-mu high-yield plots. The Jin Southeast region has already established over 80,000 mu of large-area high-yield plots, reaching 80% of the original plan. The Jin North region has established over 50,000 mu of high-yield plots, accounting for more than 50% of the hemp field bases. Changzhi City, the origin of "Lu Hemp," has established two 10,000-mu high-yield plots, four 5,000-mu plots, and nineteen 1,000-mu plots on the newly built hemp field bases. The "Five Plannings" method has been implemented in each hemp field high-yield plot to carry out basic construction. The "Five Plannings" are: planning land, planning crops, planning water conservancy, planning fertilizer, and planning roads.

    In order to check the preparation of hemp fields, each hemp region recently launched a preparation inspection movement centered on checking indicators, checking area, checking water conservancy, checking field leveling, checking water lifting tools, checking fertilizer, checking seeds, checking investment, and checking technical strength, which greatly promoted the preparation work. Through preparation inspection, Changzhi City launched a preparation upsurge. In the three communes of Han Dian, Gao He, and Su Dian alone, the newly expanded hemp land totaled more than 40,000 mu. At present, more than 27,000 people in the city have invested in hemp field water conservancy construction, and more than 47,000 mu of land have been leveled, all achieving garden-style cultivation. Here, fertilizer and seeds were also emphasized in the preparation process. The fertilizer needed for hemp fields has been accumulated to 180 dan per mu, and the prepared seeds are already sufficient to meet the needs of planting.

    In order to strengthen the Party committee's specific leadership over hemp fields, the secretaries of local Party committees in charge of agriculture personally took command, absorbed relevant departments or experienced veteran farmers to establish hemp field production guidance committees and production technology guidance networks, and regularly studied technology. Many bases also adopted the method of centralized training and apprenticeship to train a group of hemp planting experts, strengthening the technical personnel team. In particular, extensive ideological education was carried out among the masses, publicizing the important significance of hemp production to the national economy, and criticizing the views of some commune members who believed that "new hemp fields have low yields and small incomes" and "growing hemp is not as profitable as growing vegetables." On the basis of enhancing the commune members' understanding of the significance of expanding hemp fields, advanced experience in hemp production was widely exchanged.

    (Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 13th dispatch) Zhejiang Province, a major jute-producing area in China, is making preparations for this year's jute production ahead of schedule. This year, hemp-growing areas throughout the province universally require that hemp seeds be improved varieties, hemp fields be irrigated, and some hemp fields implement electric machinery for drainage and irrigation. Xiaoshan County, where the jute planting area accounted for one-third of the province in 1959, has already formulated this year's plan, not only requiring the universal realization of improved varieties and irrigation of hemp fields, but also calling for the implementation of garden-style cultivation, the thorough elimination of diseases and insect pests, to ensure a high-yield bumper harvest of jute this year.

    On the basis of summarizing the experience of the 1959 jute bumper harvest and formulating the technical outline for 1960 jute production, a large number of farmer technicians are being selected and trained throughout the region. Xiaoshan County, a major jute-producing area, has done the training work the earliest, and the training of the first batch of 260 key jute planting technicians has already ended.

    In order to increase the production of jute, the province will universally promote the "Pod Hemp" and Guangdong's "154 improved variety," which are fast-growing, tall plants, uniform top and bottom, thick-skinned, and suitable for close planting and high yields. At present, the improved varieties prepared throughout the province average four jin per mu.

    While carrying out large-scale water conservancy construction and soil improvement in the jute areas of Zhejiang, communes and production teams have also extracted labor to carry out deep plowing and land leveling, and carry out garden-style construction. Xiaoshan County has leveled 150,000 mu of cotton and hemp land, and 40% of the hemp land in Haining County has been leveled. (Chen Zhao)

    山西建立生产基地扩种大麻
    浙江积极备耕争取黄麻高产丰收
    本报太原13日电　山西省正在盛产大麻的晋东南、晋中和晋北专区的十二个县、市建立大麻生产基地。根据中共山西省委的要求，各个基地都已经统一规划了土地，采取“新麻田入伍、旧麻田归队”的办法，建立了四十万亩大麻生产基地，比去年种植面积扩大了57％。
    山西省的大麻生产历史悠久，特别是“潞麻”，更是久负盛名。这些麻类作物在最近几年来有了很大发展。为适应国民经济高速度发展对大麻的需要，中共山西省委不久以前作了关于扩大麻田生产的决定。要求全省大麻的亩产量比去年提高一倍，达到一百二十斤，总产量比去年增加两倍。
    晋东南专区对麻区干部、群众展开了广泛的宣传，使大麻生产对国民经济发展的重要意义家喻户晓之后，又在长治市韩店公社南呈管理区召开了现场会议，总结了这个管理区获得新麻田亩产一百五十斤的增产经验，坚定了群众种麻的信心。全专区十八万一千亩麻田，亩产计划指标由一百五十斤提高到一百七十斤，亩产指标比1959年实际亩产量翻一番，总产量要增三倍。晋北专区在充分发动群众建立麻产生产基地以后，全区大麻播种面积将比去年扩大9．28％，亩产指标提高57％，总产指标提高二倍多。并且把这些指标都落实到生产队。
    保证大麻大丰收的运动，已随着深入的思想发动开展起来。全省各大麻生产基地大搞万亩丰产方、千亩丰产方、百亩丰产方为中心的麻田备耕运动。晋东南专区已搞成大面积丰产方八万多亩，达到原计划的80％。晋北专区建立丰产方五万多亩，占麻田基地50％以上。“潞麻”产地长治市，在新建的麻田基地上，已搞成万亩丰产方两个，五千亩方四个，千亩方十九个。各个麻田丰产方又都实行了“五规划”的办法，进行基本建设。“五规划”是：规划土地、规划作物、规划水利、规划肥料、规划道路。
    为了检查麻田的备耕情况，最近各麻区又开展了以查指标、查面积、查水利、查田面平整、查提水工具、查肥料、查种子、查投资、查技术力量为中心的备耕检查运动，大大促进了备耕工作。长治市通过备耕检查，掀起了备耕热潮。仅韩店、高河、苏店等三个公社，新扩大的麻地就有四万多亩。目前，全市已有两万七千多人投入麻田水利建设，已平整好土地四万七千多亩，全部实现园田化。这里，在备耕中还抓了肥料和种子，麻田需要的肥料，每亩已积一百八十担，准备好的种子，已经可以满足下种的需要。
    为了加强党委对麻田的具体领导，各地党委主管农业的书记亲自挂帅，吸收有关部门或有种麻经验的老农成立麻田生产指导委员会和生产技术指导网，定期研究技术。不少基地还采取集中训练和带徒弟的办法，训练了一批大麻种植手，壮大了技术人员队伍。特别对群众进行了广泛的思想教育，宣传了大麻生产对国民经济的重要意义，并批判了部分社员认为“新麻地产量低，收入不大”和“种麻不如种菜的收入大”的论调。在提高社员对扩大麻田意义的认识的基础上，又广泛交流了大麻生产的先进经验。
    本报杭州13日电　我国主要络麻产区浙江省，正在提前进行今年络麻生产的各项准备工作。今年全省麻区普遍要求做到麻种良种化，麻田水利化和部分麻地实行电力机械排灌。1959年络麻种植面积占全省三分之一的萧山县，已订出今年的规划，不仅要求普遍实现麻田良种化、水利化，还号召实行耕作园田化，彻底消灭病虫害，以保证今年络麻高产丰收。
    各地在总结1959年络麻丰产的经验和制定1960年络麻生产的技术纲要的基础上，选拔和培训大批农民技术员。络麻主要产区萧山县的培训工作做得最早，第一批二百六十名植麻技术骨干的训练已经结束。
    为了增产络麻，全省将普遍推广生长快、植株高，上下匀、皮厚，适宜密植高产的“荚头麻”和广东“154良种”。目前全省已准备的良种，平均每亩有四斤。
    浙江各麻区在大修水利、改良土壤的同时，各公社、生产队还抽出劳力进行深翻和平整土地，大搞园田化建设。萧山县已平整好棉、麻地十五万亩，海宁县有40％麻地已经平好。　　　　（陈昭）
