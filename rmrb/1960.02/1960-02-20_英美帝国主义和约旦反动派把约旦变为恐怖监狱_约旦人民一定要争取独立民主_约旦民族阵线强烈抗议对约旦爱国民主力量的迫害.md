Xinhua News Agency, Amman, February 19th: The Jordanian National Front issued an appeal on February 7th to all political parties, organizations, newspapers, peace and democratic forces, and all kind-hearted people around the world, calling on them to unite with the patriotic forces of Jordan to strongly protest the atrocities and persecution inflicted on the patriotic and democratic forces of Jordan by Anglo-American imperialists and their agents in Jordan.

In this document, the Jordanian National Front also called on them to send telegrams to the Jordanian government and the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, demanding that this campaign of terror and persecution be stopped in Jordan, that democracy and freedom be restored, and that hundreds of arrested political prisoners be released.

The appeal stated that Anglo-American imperialists and their agents in Jordan have turned Jordan into a vast prison filled with terror, persecution, exile, and total economic collapse. All of this is being carried out according to a conspiracy to eliminate the national liberation movement, place Jordan under the control of imperialism, and turn it into a base for aggression against the Arab liberation movement, especially against the Republic of Iraq.

The appeal stated that approximately three years ago, in order to realize the Eisenhower-Dulles Doctrine, Anglo-American imperialists colluded with domestic reactionary dark forces and Arab reactionaries in Jordan to launch a reactionary coup. This coup eliminated Jordan's national regime, undermined the independence and democracy of the Jordanian people, and plundered all of Jordan's national interests. Since then, the Jordanian people have been living under a black police regime.

The appeal stated that the reactionary regime established after this coup promulgated martial law, dissolved parliament, political parties, trade unions, agricultural associations, and mass organizations of students, women, and civil servants, purged patriotic military officers, closed all cultural clubs, social clubs, and all patriotic newspapers, and launched a campaign of mass arrests. Hundreds of outstanding Jordanian sons and daughters from various classes with different political leanings were arrested. Many of them were brutally sentenced to death or long prison terms by military tribunals. Many of those arrested were subjected to all kinds of barbaric persecution, such as whipping, branding with hot irons, electric chairs, nail extraction, and force-feeding with chili water. Many people who suffered torture developed mental illnesses or became disabled. Hundreds of people were imprisoned in prisons and desert concentration camps. Women were not exempt from the persecution of this black terror.

The appeal pointed out that the Jordanian reactionary government has also formulated a series of reactionary laws, and recently amended the "Law Against Communism," stipulating that anyone suspected of being a communist or having connections with communists shall be sentenced to life imprisonment. Many "National Security Courts" have been established throughout Jordan, and their sole task is to try patriots.

The appeal pointed out that King Hussein of Jordan and his Prime Minister Hazza' al-Majali, and their ruling clique do not conceal their conspiracy to link Jordan with the Central Treaty Organization. The King of Jordan does not conceal his ambition to restore the decadent monarchy of Iraq and proclaim himself King of Iraq. These are all carried out with the instigation and support of Anglo-American imperialism.

The appeal concluded by saying that the heroic Jordanian people, despite being the people of a small country, despite the barbaric persecution and the economic disasters imposed on them by the imperialists and their servants, are determined to continue the struggle for peace, national independence, and democracy, and they will never allow their beloved motherland to become a manor for imperialists and their lackeys, and a base for undermining the Arab liberation movement. The appeal stated: Thanks to the struggle and unity of our people, thanks to the solidarity of our people with our fraternal peoples and relying on all the peace, democracy, and socialist forces in the world, headed by the great Soviet Union, our people are full of confidence in victory.

    英美帝国主义和约旦反动派把约旦变为恐怖监狱
    约旦人民一定要争取独立民主
    约旦民族阵线强烈抗议对约旦爱国民主力量的迫害
    新华社19日讯　安曼消息：约旦民族阵线在2月7日向全世界各个政党、组织、报纸、和平民主力量和一切善良人们发表一项呼吁书，要求他们和约旦的爱国力量团结一致，强烈抗议英、美帝国主义者及其在约旦的代理人对约旦爱国、民主力量施加的暴行和迫害。
    约旦民族阵线在这项文件中还呼吁他们向约旦政府和联合国人权委员会拍发电报，要求在约旦停止这种恐怖迫害运动，恢复民主、自由，释放数以百计的被捕的政治犯。
    呼吁书说，英、美帝国主义者及其在约旦的代理人已经把约旦变成为一个充满恐怖、迫害、流亡和经济全面崩溃的大监狱。所有这一切都是按照消灭民族解放运动，把约旦置于帝国主义的魔掌，把它变成为对阿拉伯解放运动，特别是对伊拉克共和国进行侵略的基地的阴谋进行的。
    呼吁书说，大约在三年以前，英、美帝国主义者为了实现艾森豪威尔——杜勒斯主义，同约旦国内反动的黑暗势力以及阿拉伯反动派相互勾结，在约旦发动了反动政变。这个政变消灭了约旦的民族政权，破坏了约旦人民的独立和民主，掠夺了约旦的一切民族利益。自从那时以来，约旦人民就生活在黑色的警察统治之下。
    呼吁书说，在这次政变后建立的反动政权颁布了戒严令，解散了议会、各个政党、工会、农会和学生、妇女、公务员等群众组织，清洗爱国军官，封闭了一切文化俱乐部、社会俱乐部和一切爱国报纸，并且发动了大肆逮捕的运动。数百名出身于不同政治倾向的各个阶级的约旦优秀儿女被捕了。他们当中有许多人被军事法庭粗暴地判处了死刑或长期徒刑。许多被捕者受到各种各样的野蛮迫害，如鞭打、火烙、坐电椅、剥指甲、灌辣椒水等等。很多遭受酷刑的人得了神经病或变成残废。数百人被关在监狱和沙漠集中营里。妇女也不能免于这种黑色恐怖的迫害。
    呼吁书指出，约旦反动政府还制订了一系列反动法令，最近又修改了“反对共产主义的法令”，凡是有共产党嫌疑或同共产党人有关系的人都被判以终身监禁。在约旦全国各地设立了许多“国家治安法庭”，它唯一的任务是审判爱国者。
    呼吁书指出，约旦国王侯赛因和他的首相哈扎·马贾利以及他们的统治集团并不隐瞒他们企图把约旦和中央条约组织联系在一起的阴谋。约旦国王并不隐瞒他想恢复伊拉克腐朽的君主制度和自封为伊拉克国王的野心。这些都是在英、美帝国主义的怂恿和支持下进行的。
    呼吁书最后说，英勇的约旦人民尽管他们是个小国的人民，尽管他们遭到野蛮的迫害和帝国主义者及其仆从们所强加给他们的经济灾难，但是他们决心要继续进行争取和平、民族独立和民主的斗争，他们永远也不会允许把他们可爱的祖国变成为帝国主义者及其走狗们的庄园，变成破坏阿拉伯解放运动的基地。呼吁书说：由于我们人民的斗争和队伍的团结，由于我们人民同兄弟人民的团结一致和依靠世界上以伟大的苏联为首的一切和平、民主和社会主义力量，我们的人民对胜利是充满信心的。
