Xinhua News Agency, Jilin Electric Report Jilin Chemical Industrial Company's workers are carrying out a large-scale technical innovation movement, tapping the potential of equipment, and increasing the production of chemical fertilizers and pesticide raw materials to support agricultural technical transformation. From the beginning of the year to February 15, the workers of Jilin Fertilizer Plant have realized 4,376 technical innovation proposals. The average daily output of ammonium nitrate in the first half of February increased by 7.76% compared with January.
    The workers have also successfully trial-produced many new products using waste gas, waste liquid, and waste residue. Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant and Dyeing Plant used waste sulfuric acid and ammonia water to make nitrogen fertilizer ammonium sulfate, which is currently being produced in large quantities. Lu Fengchun, an advanced producer from the Calcium Carbide Plant who attended the National Congress of Heroes, used discarded phosphorus mud to trial-produce phosphorus acid, an important pesticide raw material. The Calcium Carbide Plant has built a phosphorus acid workshop with an annual output of 1,000 tons using old factory buildings and old equipment, and is producing phosphorus acid using the method successfully tested by Lu Fengchun.
    The company has established extensive contacts with nearby people's communes. On the one hand, it assists counties and communes in building small and medium-sized synthetic ammonia plants and pesticide plants with manpower and materials; on the other hand, it opens up experimental fields in rural areas to test and study the effectiveness of various chemical fertilizers on different crops under different soil conditions and application methods, in order to continuously improve product quality and formulate scientific application methods to better support rural areas.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing Electric Report Nanjing Chemical Industrial Company is taking various measures to increase the production of chemical fertilizers to support agricultural production. In January and the first ten days of February this year, the company has shipped more than 55,000 tons of chemical fertilizers such as superphosphate, ammonium sulfate, and ammonia water, which is three times the amount shipped in the same period last year.
    The company plans to produce nearly 40% more fertilizer this year than in 1959, and will also produce new pesticide products such as "Dipterex" in large quantities. In order to ensure the completion of these production tasks, the company's workers have widely launched a mass movement to increase production and practice economy centered on technical innovation and technical revolution since the beginning of this year. They focused on the weak links in chemical production, basic construction, design research, machinery manufacturing, and transportation work, and realized 5,000 innovation proposals in January and 1,700 innovation proposals in the first five days of February, thus rapidly increasing fertilizer production.

    主力军带头增产化肥
    吉林、南京两大化学工业公司革新运动热火朝天
    新华社吉林电　吉林化学工业公司职工大搞技术革新运动，挖掘设备潜力，增产化学肥料和农药原料，支援农业技术改造。吉林肥料厂职工从年初到2月15日实现了技术革新建议四千三百七十六件，硝铵的平均日产量2月上半月比1月份增长7．76％。
    职工们还利用废气、废液、废渣试制成功了许多新产品。吉林电石厂和染料厂利用废硫酸和氨水制成氮肥硫铵，目前正在大批生产。出席全国群英会的电石厂先进生产者吕凤春，利用废弃的磷泥试制成重要的农药原料磷酸。电石厂已利用旧厂房和旧设备建成一座年产一千吨的磷酸工段，运用吕凤春试验成功的方法生产磷酸。
    这个公司与附近的人民公社建立了广泛的联系。一方面以人力和物力协助县、社建设中小型的合成氨厂和农药厂；一方面在农村开辟试验田，试验和研究各种化学肥料在不同的土质条件下对不同作物的效能和施用方法，以便不断地提高产品质量，制订出科学的施用方法，更好地支援农村。
    新华社南京电　南京化学工业公司正在采取多种措施，增产化学肥料支援农业生产。今年1月份和2月上旬，这个公司已出厂过磷酸钙、硫酸铵、氨水等化肥五万五千多吨，为去年同期出厂数量的三倍。
    这个公司今年计划生产的化肥比1959年增长近四成，还将大批生产“敌百虫”等农药新产品。为了保证完成这些生产任务，公司职工今年一开始就广泛地开展了以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约群众运动。他们围绕化工生产、基本建设、设计研究、机械制造和运输工作中的薄弱环节，1月份实现了五千项革新建议，2月份的头五天又实现一千七百项革新建议，因此使化肥产量迅速上升。
