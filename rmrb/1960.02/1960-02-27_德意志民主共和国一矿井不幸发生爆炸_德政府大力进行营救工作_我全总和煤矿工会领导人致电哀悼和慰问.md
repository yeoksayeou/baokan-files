The mine rescue team is making every effort to rescue the miners. The rescue work has received strong support from all over, and Czechoslovakia has also sent experts to assist.

Despite the immediate adoption of the most comprehensive rescue measures, forty-nine miners have unfortunately died.

Currently, the rescue team is still working hard to rescue the more than seventy miners still trapped in the mine. High heat and thick smoke have made the rescue work extremely difficult, but the rescuers are doing their best to put out the fire step by step and find their class brothers.

After the unfortunate incident, the government committee, headed by Gregor, First Deputy Chairman of the State Planning Commission, immediately arrived at the scene to guide and supervise the rescue work. A delegation led by Premier Grotewohl and People's Chamber Presidium Chairman Dieckmann and others arrived at the scene to inspect the rescue work.

The government of the German Democratic Republic held a meeting and observed a moment of silence for the victims of this incident. Premier Grotewohl reported on the progress of the rescue work at the meeting.
