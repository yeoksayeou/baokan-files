Notes

    Not an Accidental Outburst
    British Air Vice-Marshal Markle wrote a book entitled "Global Strategy." The title itself is nothing new, but rather a rehash of what the Pentagon generals have said. As for its content? First, it advocates for a major war rather than small skirmishes; second, it argues that if war is to be fought, it should be fought early, and NATO must be the first to use tactical nuclear weapons, followed by the use of nuclear weapons for strategic purposes. This is also not a new theory, but an echo of the Pentagon generals' calls for "preemptive" war.

    In terms of war mania, who can surpass the Pentagon generals? Markle is just a supporting actor.

    Markle himself is willing to be a supporting actor, and does not hesitate to use Britain as a sacrificial pawn in America's war adventures. On the one hand, he wants Britain to rely on the United States, and on the other hand, he calls on the United States to share weal and woe with Britain and launch a third world war against the socialist camp on the basis of the two countries' alliance.

    What is the reason for Markle's madness? Markle admits that because the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp are so strong, if they launch a war, the rear areas of Britain and Western European countries will become radioactive deserts, and the United States and its military potential may not be much less fatally wounded than Britain; however, he also believes that in the situation where the socialist camp is greatly consolidated and the national revolutionary movement is increasingly high, Britain's strength is great, and the United States should not even think about waiting until Britain collapses before trying to win. Therefore, the United States and Britain are in the same boat, so it is better to make a desperate gamble together and make a dying struggle.

    Therefore, although Markle's book does not have any point that is more brilliant than any of the Pentagon generals from beginning to end, it reveals the secret that the Pentagon generals dare not say so frankly. He is tantamount to ringing a useful alarm, urging the world's forces for peace to be vigilant: as long as imperialism exists, the danger of war, including the danger of imperialism launching a "preemptive" war, exists. There are always madmen, and their madness is not an accidental outburst, but a daily plan and preparation to save the end of capitalism.

    不是偶然的发作
    英国空军副元帅马克洛写了一本书，书名是“全球战略”。书名就不是什么新东西，而是从五角大楼将军们那里拾来之牙慧。至其内容呢？一是鼓吹与其小搞，不如来一次大战；二是主张要打就早打，北大西洋公约组织必须第一个使用战术的原子武器，紧接着为战略目的使用原子武器。这也并非新论，而是对五角大楼将军们的“先发制人”的战争叫嚣的帮腔。
    在战争狂热上，还有谁能超过五角大楼的将军们呢？马克洛也不过是一个配角而已。
    马克洛自己亦甘当配角，并不惜把英国作为美国在战争冒险中的陪葬人。他一面要英国依靠美国，一面呼吁美国与英国共患难，在两国同盟的基础上发动反对社会主义阵营的第三次世界大战。
    马克洛这样疯狂的原因何在呢？马克洛承认，由于苏联和整个社会主义阵营如此强大，如果他们发动战争就会使英国和西欧各国的后方变为放射素的荒漠，而美国及其军事潜力亦未见得比英国的致命伤少些；但是，他又认为在社会主义阵营大大巩固和民族革命运动日益高涨的形势下，英国实力固然大，美国也别想等到英国垮了再去取胜。因此，美英同病相怜，就不如共同孤注一掷，作垂死的挣扎。
    因此，虽然马克洛的这本书从头到尾都没有一点比五角大楼将军们任何高明之处，但说出了五角大楼将军们所不敢如此坦率说出来的秘密。他无异敲起有益的警钟，要全世界争取和平的力量警惕：帝国主义存在一天，战争危险包括帝国主义发动“先发制人”的战争危险就存在一天。疯子总是有的，他们的疯狂也不是偶然的发作，而是有着挽救资本主义末日的日夜从事的计划和准备的。
