Exciting Numbers
Zheng Zuoyao

"…In 1957, the national film audience was 1.75 billion person-times, which leaped to 4.05 billion person-times in 1959. That is to say, the numbers achieved in the two years since the Great Leap Forward were equivalent to those achieved in the past eight years. An annual audience of 4 billion is already a considerable figure, especially when compared with the declining film audience in Western capitalist countries. Our growth is particularly prominent (for example, in Britain, the annual audience was 1.65 billion in 1948, which sharply decreased to 750 million in 1958, and last year, it dropped again to around 600 million)." (See Xia Yan's "Strive for the Continued Great Leap Forward of the Film Industry" in the February 2nd "People's Daily") The changes in these numbers at least illustrate the following issues.

First of all, the Great Leap Forward is a comprehensive leap forward in all undertakings and all work in our country. This is not only the case on the production front, but also on the cultural front. The film audience jumping from 1.75 billion to 4.05 billion person-times shows that the cultural life of the people has improved with each passing day, and the appearance is completely new.

The reason why our films have gained so many viewers is also because they are socialist films. Our film work has implemented Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy. Many excellent films have good ideology, good content, and good artistic techniques, and are of great educational significance to the people, and are therefore loved by the vast audience.

People may remember that the imperialists and their running dogs have repeatedly attacked and slandered our Great Leap Forward as so-called "forced labor"? But please see, even the number of film viewers has leaped forward, with the average person going from nearly three times in 1957 to nearly seven times last year. That is to say, on average, each person watches about seven movies a year. May I ask what explanations can those rumor-mongers and slanderers give? In capitalist countries, various deceptive tricks are used, but they cannot increase the number of moviegoers in their own countries, but instead, it decreases year by year. What does this illustrate? In capitalist countries, large numbers of people are unemployed and impoverished, and people struggle on the brink of death year after year. Even those who have jobs can only barely make ends meet. How can they have so much spare money and a happy mood to watch movies? Workers, peasants, and some intellectuals who have lived through the old China have tasted this kind of feeling.

In addition, what kind of stuff are the films in capitalist countries? Apart from a few works with progressive tendencies that are not for profit, the vast majority are tools used by monopoly capital groups to anesthetize and poison the people, and to promote fascist ideas, atomic terror, and the decadent lifestyles of the bourgeoisie. In terms of ideological content, they are reactionary, obscene, and decadent; in terms of artistic techniques, they are also vulgar and clumsy. Such works are bound to be divorced from the masses. The growing number of conscious masses are unwilling to watch these works, which is one of the fundamental reasons for the sharp decline in audience numbers.

The decline in their film audience numbers is destined by the capitalist system that exploits the blood and sweat of the people. The increase in our film audience numbers is also determined by our superior socialist system. Therefore, from the surface, this film audience statistic seems simple, but it can make people think a lot and make people feel extremely excited.

    使人兴奋的数字
    郑祚尧
    “……1957年全国电影观众十七亿五千万人次，1959年一跃而达到四十亿五千万人次。也就是说，大跃进以来的两年时间，达到了过去用八年时间才能达到的数字。每年观众四十亿人次，这已经是一个不小的数字，特别是和西方资本主义国家的电影观众逐年锐减的情况比较起来，我们的增长就显得非常突出（例如英国，1948年每年观众十六亿五千万，1958年激减到七亿五千万，去年，又降低到六亿左右）。”（见2月2日“人民日报”夏衍：“为电影事业的继续大跃进而奋斗”）这些数字的变化，至少说明了这样几个问题。
    首先，大跃进是我国各项事业各项工作全面的跃进。不仅在生产战线上是这样，而且在文化战线上也是这样。电影观众由十七亿五千万人次一跃而达到四十亿五千万人次，这个数字的变化，说明了人民群众的文化生活提高，真是日新月异，面貌一新。
    我们的电影所以获得那么多的观众，还因为它们是社会主义的电影。我们的电影工作贯彻了毛主席的文艺方针。许多优秀的影片思想好，内容好，艺术技巧也好，对人民的教育意义大，因而受到广大观众的喜爱。
    人们都曾记得，帝国主义和它的走狗们不是一再攻击和诬蔑我们的大跃进是所谓“强迫劳动”吗？可是请看吧，连电影观众的数字也大跃进起来，平均每人由1957年将近三次达到去年的将近七次。就是说平均每人每年约看七次电影。试问那些造谣家和诽谤家们又能作何解释呢？而在资本主义国家，耍了各种骗人的花招，也不能使他们本国看电影的观众增加，反而逐年下降。这说明了什么问题呢？资本主义国家成批成批地失业、贫困，人们成年累月在死亡线上挣扎，就是有工作的，也只能糊口。他们又怎么能够有那么多余钱和愉快的心情去看电影呢？这种滋味，从旧中国生活过来的工人、农民和一部分知识分子是尝过的。
    此外，资本主义国家的电影又是些什么货色呢？除了少数有进步倾向、不以赢利为目的的作品外，绝大多数是垄断资本集团拿它作为麻醉人民、毒害人民的工具，作为宣传法西斯思想、宣传原子恐怖、宣传资产阶级腐朽的生活方式的工具。它们在思想内容上，是反动的，诲淫诲盗的，颓废的；在艺术技巧上，也是庸俗拙劣的。这样的作品必然是脱离群众的。日益增多的有觉悟的群众，不愿意看这些作品，这也是使观众人数激减的根本原因之一。
    他们的电影观众数字下降，是那种剥削人民血汗的资本主义制度所注定了的。而我们电影观众数字的上升，也是我们社会主义的优越制度所决定了的。所以，从表面上看来，这个电影观众的统计数字虽则简单，但能使人想得很多，也使人无比兴奋。
