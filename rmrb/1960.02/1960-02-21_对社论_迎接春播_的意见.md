    Opinion on the Editorial "Welcoming the Spring Planting"
    After reading the People's Daily editorial "Welcoming the Spring Planting" on February 5th, I felt it was very helpful to me. But I also felt there were some shortcomings. The editorial said: "The continued leap forward in agricultural production in 1960 means obtaining much more grain than in the past, and obtaining much more oil, hemp, tea, flue-cured tobacco, sugar, silk, fruits, vegetables, medicinal materials, and other agricultural products than in the past." It did not specifically mention cotton. The importance of cotton is known to everyone and should be loudly emphasized.　Henan　Bai Shangzhi

    对社论“迎接春播”的意见
    读了人民日报2月5日“迎接春播”的社论，觉得对自己帮助很大。但也感到有美中不足的地方。社论说：“1960年农业生产的继续跃进，就是要拿到比过去多得多的粮食，拿到比过去多得多的油料、麻类、茶叶、烤烟、糖料、蚕丝、果品、蔬菜、药材和其他各种农产品。”这里没有具体谈到棉花。棉花的重要性是人人皆知的，应当响亮地提出。　河南　白尚志
