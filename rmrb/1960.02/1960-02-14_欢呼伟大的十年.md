    Hailing the Great Decade
    Aosong
    The east wind turns the earth green, and the Chinese people are especially excited and joyful as they welcome the tenth anniversary of the signing of the great Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. Of course, it is not only the people of China and the Soviet Union who are cheering for the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, but also the people of other fraternal countries in our socialist camp, the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are fighting bravely for national independence and democracy, and all peace-loving and progressive people in the world. Many of them, living under the rule of imperialism and reactionaries, cannot cheer as much as they want to, but they look to the banner of this great alliance, their hearts burning with blessings and hope.
    Over the past ten years, China and the Soviet Union have not only achieved unprecedented achievements in socialist construction through close cooperation in politics, economy, and culture, thus greatly strengthening the strength of the socialist camp and the forces of world peace; but also fought hand in hand in the struggle for peace, together with other fraternal countries and all peace-loving people around the world, forcing the imperialist war forces to retreat from Incheon, Dien Bien Phu, the Suez Canal, the beaches of Beirut... achieving the advantage of peace forces overwhelming war forces. In this series of repeated and serious contests, the unity of the great China and the Soviet Union has played a very brilliant role. The Sino-Soviet alliance is truly a strong fortress of world peace, which is an important reason why the Sino-Soviet alliance has won the hearts of the world.
    Of course, there are also a small number of people in the world who hate China and the Soviet Union, and hate the Sino-Soviet alliance and the entire socialist camp. These are the imperialists headed by the United States, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries. The reason is very simple, because with the existence of the powerful Sino-Soviet alliance and the powerful socialist camp, the imperialists and their lackeys cannot do whatever they want, and they encounter insurmountable obstacles on the road to aggression and war. The greater the failures and difficulties they suffer, the more they hope to undermine the unity of socialist countries, especially between China and the Soviet Union, in order to save themselves from their doom. This desperate calculation will of course never be realized. Because the imperialists and their lackeys cannot and will never understand that the alliance between our two great socialist countries is an alliance based on Marxism-Leninism, which is completely different from any alliance between exploiters in human history. Common interests and common ideals bind our two countries closely together, and no force in the world can separate us.
    Now is an era when the west wind is weakening and the east wind is prevailing. Capitalism is already declining and losing its luster. All roads lead to communism. The Sino-Soviet alliance, as the core of the world's socialist forces, will continue to radiate immense brilliance and infinite vitality, powerfully promoting mankind towards peace and progress.

    欢呼伟大的十年
    奥松
    东风吹绿大地，中国人民迎接伟大的中苏友好同盟互助条约签订十周年，分外感到兴奋和欢乐。当然，为中苏友好同盟互助条约签订十周年而欢欣鼓舞的不止是我们中苏两国人民，还有我们社会主义阵营其他兄弟国家的人民，还有亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲为争取民族独立、民主而英勇奋斗的人民，还有世界上一切爱好和平和进步的人们，其中有许多人由于处在帝国主义和反动派的统治下，不能尽情欢呼，但他们遥望着这个伟大同盟的旗帜，内心燃烧着祝福和希望。
    十年来，中国和苏联不但在政治、经济、文化各方面的紧密合作，取得了社会主义建设空前的成就，从而大大加强了社会主义阵营的力量与世界和平力量；而且还在争取和平的斗争中携手奋斗，同其他兄弟国家和全世界一切爱好和平的人民一道，迫使帝国主义战争势力从仁川、从奠边府、从苏伊士运河、从贝鲁特海滩……退却，获致了和平力量压倒战争势力的优势。在这一系列的反复的严重较量中，伟大的中苏两国的团结一致起了十分辉煌的作用。中苏同盟真正是世界和平的坚强堡垒，这就是中苏同盟赢得世界人心向往的重要原因。
    当然，世界上也有一小撮人痛恨中国和苏联，痛恨中苏同盟和整个社会主义阵营。这就是以美国为首的帝国主义者，现代修正主义者和各国反动派。道理很简单，因为有强大的中苏同盟和强大的社会主义阵营的存在，帝国主义及其走狗就不能为所欲为，使他们在进行侵略和战争的道路上碰到了不许通过的障碍。他们遭受到的失败和困难越大，就越是指望破坏社会主义国家、特别是中苏之间的团结来挽救他们的厄运。这种穷极无聊的算盘，当然是永远不会实现的。因为帝国主义及其走狗们不会也不可能理解，我们两大社会主义国家的同盟是以马克思列宁主义为思想基础的同盟，是同人类历史上任何剥削者之间的同盟毫无相同之处的。共同的利益和共同的理想把我们两国紧紧结合在一起，世界上没有任何力量可以把我们分开。
    现在是西风日衰，东风日盛的时代。资本主义已经日薄西山，黯然无色。条条道路通向共产主义。作为世界社会主义力量的核心的中苏同盟，必将继续进一步发挥万丈的光芒和无穷的生命力，有力地促使人类走向和平与进步。
