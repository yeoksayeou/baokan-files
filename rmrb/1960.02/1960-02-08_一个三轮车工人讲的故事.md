A Tricycle Worker's Story
Wu Zhaofu

The Spring Festival was approaching, and the army was about to conduct a mass discipline inspection on supporting the government and cherishing the people. I had the opportunity to participate in this inspection. During the inspection, I heard a story told by a tricycle worker that I found unforgettable...

Comrade, it was the morning of the day after the Mid-Autumn Festival. The sky was just beginning to lighten when the train from Beijing to Lanzhou pulled into the station in Luoyang. An officer in riding breeches stepped out of the station, carrying a large leather suitcase. After telling me the address, I got on the bike and pulled him along. This officer was very friendly, asking me this and that along the way, asking how many people were in my family, where we lived, and how our lives were going. Before we even reached the department store, my stomach ailment flared up again. Comrade, I've been pulling a rickshaw all my life. You know, a tricycle driver before liberation couldn't even think about opening his mouth to complain. It was always a cold meal here, a hot meal there, sometimes with food, sometimes without. I caught this illness back then. After liberation, things got better. We rickshaw pullers truly entered paradise. We no longer had to worry about food or clothing, and we were no longer beaten or scolded. My child is in middle school, and the union even tries to find ways to treat my illness. Now my illness is much better, but it hasn't been cured completely. It still flares up from time to time, and that day it flared up, didn't it? When the pain hit, I hunched over. Pedaling became weak, and the cart moved slower. When the officer comrade saw me like this, he said, "Comrade, are you not feeling well?" "It's nothing, just an old problem, stomach pain." "Comrade, then you should take a rest!" "No, I'll just pedal slowly." I thought to myself, if I'd encountered this situation before liberation, wouldn't I have just gritted my teeth and endured it? Although I thought that way, at that moment, my calves really couldn't muster any strength, and the cart moved even slower. At this time, the officer comrade told me to stop. Without saying a word, he jumped off the cart: "Comrade, get down." "What's wrong? Just let me pull slowly." "Comrade, get down!" He helped me down and then helped me into the seat where he had been sitting. As for him? He sat in the seat where I had been sitting. At that moment, I was stunned. "Comrade, don't you live in Dongguan? I'll pull you there. Liberation Army soldiers can do anything." No matter what I said, he insisted on taking me home. Comrade, I'm a tough guy, but at that moment, I don't know why, I started to cry! At this time, my stomach was even more uncooperative, and it really hurt badly. I had no choice but to obey him, thinking that when I got home, I would have my child call a cart to take the officer comrade back.

The officer comrade took me home, and the happiness of my family was beyond words. The child called Old Liu and asked him to take the officer back. When he was leaving, he repeatedly told me to see a doctor and insisted on giving the fare to my family. How could I accept it? But he insisted that we accept it, and we had no choice but to accept it, thinking that we would give it to Old Liu when he returned.

Comrade, on the way the officer comrade pulled me home, I thought, if this had happened before liberation, and I couldn't pull anymore, wouldn't I have been kicked and slapped? I remember that in the first year after our city was liberated, I was also pulling passengers from the train station. That time, I was pulling a Kuomintang officer. Halfway there, my stomach started to hurt again. The cart slowed down, and the officer on the cart started to scold me, stomping his feet on the cart, almost breaking the boards. I was really annoyed, but I still said meekly, "Sir, it's not far now, and you haven't brought anything heavy. Please have some mercy and walk back!" He stood up and slapped me twice. I knew that there was no use in saying anything more, so I had to swallow this grievance and pull that guy to his destination with all my might, but he didn't give me a single penny!

Comrade, let's not talk about those things from the past. Our Chairman Mao's army really thinks of us people in everything!

Speaking to here, I saw his eyes moisten again...

    一个三轮车工人讲的故事
    吴肇富
    春节到了，部队要进行拥政爱民的群众纪律检查。我有机会参加了这次检查，在检查中，听到一个三轮车工人讲的一个故事，使我久久难忘……
    同志，那是中秋节刚过的第二天早上，天刚麻麻亮，北京开到兰州去的火车在洛阳进站了。一个穿马裤的军官走出站来，提着一个大皮箱，说清地点后，我蹬上车拉着他就走。这位军官挺和气，一路上问我这问我那，问我家有几口人，住在哪，生活过得怎么样。还没到百货大楼，我的胃病又犯了。同志，咱拉了一辈子车啦。你知道，解放前咱一个蹬三轮的，哪能顾得上张嘴啊，还不是冷一顿、热一顿，有一顿、没一顿的。这个病就在那时染上了。解放后，光景好了，咱拉车的真进了天堂啦，不愁吃不愁穿，再也不挨打受骂，孩子上中学了，工会还想法给咱治病。现在我的病好多了，只是没断根，间不间还得犯，那天不就犯了不是？这一疼啦，咱就把腰哈下来了。蹬起来没劲，车子也就走得慢了。军官同志看我这样子就说：“同志，你不舒服吧？”“没啥，老毛病，胃气疼。”“同志，那你歇会儿吧！”“不，慢慢蹬吧。”咱想，解放前碰到这样的情况，咱还不是咬咬牙熬过来吗！虽然这样寻思，可这会儿，腿肚实在提不起劲来，车走得更慢了。这时候，军官同志叫我站住了，二话没说，自己就跳下车来：“同志，你下来。”“咋啦？还是慢慢拉吧。”“同志，下来吧！”说着就把我扶下来，又搀我坐到他坐的位置上去。而他自己呢？坐到我原来坐的位置上去了。这会儿，可把我给楞住了。“同志，你家不是住东关吗，我拉你去吧，解放军战士啥也能干。”我再说啥也不行，他非把我送到家不可。同志，咱是硬汉子，可这会儿，不知咋的，掉泪了！这时候，胃也更不争气了，实在疼得厉害，我只好依了他，心想，到家让孩子叫部车把军官同志送回去吧。
    军官同志把我送回家，一家人的高兴劲就甭说了。小孩把老刘叫来了，叫老刘把军官送回去。临走的时候，他再三嘱咐要我去看看医生，还硬要把车钱给我家里人。咱哪能收呢，可他非要咱收下不可，咱只得收下了，心想，等老刘回来给老刘吧。
    同志，在军官同志拉我回来的路上，咱就想，这要在解放前，拉不动了，还不又得挨皮靴、耳光。记得是我们这城市解放的头一年，我也是从火车站往外拉客人，那回拉的是一个国民党军官。半路上我也是胃疼起来了，车走慢了，车上的当官的就骂起来，在车上直跺脚，车板都快蹬破了。我实在恼火了，但还是低声下气地说：“老总，路不远了，你也没带啥重东西，积积德，劳驾你走回去吧！”他站起来就打我两巴掌。我知道再说也不行了，只好咽下这口怨气，拼着老命把那家伙拉到了，可是他一个钱也不给！
    同志，过去这些事甭提了。咱毛主席的军队真是处处为了咱人民呀！
    讲到这里，我看到他的眼眶里又湿润了……
