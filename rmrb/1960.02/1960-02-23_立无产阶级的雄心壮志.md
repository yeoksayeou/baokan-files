    Establish the Lofty Aspirations of the Proletariat
    The proletarian class possesses a unique ambition, revolutionary scope, and revolutionary thoroughness unmatched by any other class. Historically, the bourgeoisie, in its youth, did possess some minor "ambition," namely the progressiveness of opposing feudalism and developing social productive forces. However, since the working class stepped onto the political stage and grew stronger, and since capitalist relations of production became a shackle on the development of productive forces, the progressiveness of this class has gradually transformed into reaction. It has become corrupt, decadent, moribund, and struggling in its death throes, with no remaining "ambition." The petty bourgeoisie, before accepting the leadership of the proletariat and embarking on the path of communism, its ambition was nothing more than coveting the wealth of small landlords. As for their illusory "comfortable family" life, it was merely a pitiful and mediocre plan for personal gain, utterly incomparable to the proletariat's selfless and magnificent communist ambition!
    The process of the proletariat carrying out revolution and realizing its ideals is a lengthy one, and the things that must be overthrown and that weigh heavily on its head are numerous and burdensome. Without lofty ambitions and a spirit of continuous revolution, it is clearly impossible to adapt to this situation of "heavy responsibilities and a long road," and it is insufficient to accomplish great things. Therefore, the proletarian's lofty ambition is a reflection of its class position and historical mission, and at the same time, it is realized through continuous revolution. The proletariat already existed in feudal society. The proletariat is situated at the lowest stratum of society. In addition, there are landlords, the bourgeoisie, the petty bourgeoisie, and the semi-proletariat. If the proletariat wants to completely turn itself over and liberate itself, first of all, it must win over allies and grasp the leadership of the democratic revolution so that after achieving victory in the democratic revolution, it can immediately transition to the socialist revolution. The proletariat carrying out the socialist revolution must first seize political power, smash the state machinery of the bourgeoisie, establish the dictatorship of the proletariat, and then change private ownership to public ownership and individual ownership to collective ownership in terms of ownership, and also realize a single, all-people ownership. At the same time, the proletariat must also carry out a thorough socialist revolution on the political and ideological front, promoting the proletariat and eliminating the bourgeoisie, in order to defend and promote the socialist economic base, and while preparing the material production conditions, greatly enhance the people's communist consciousness and moral qualities, creating conditions in the political and ideological aspects for the transition to communist society. In short, the proletariat must, through continuous revolution, completely eliminate the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie politically, economically, and ideologically, in order to completely eliminate its own status as proletarians and achieve complete liberation. Conversely, some comrades, on the long road of revolution, attempt to take one step and stop, or to make the revolution stagnate. These kinds of half-hearted thoughts are manifestations of a lack of proletarian revolutionary ambition.
    Revolution and construction are inseparable. At present, the lofty ambition of the proletariat in our country is the lofty ambition to carry the socialist revolution through to the end, and it is also the lofty ambition to build socialism and communism. The resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party pointed out: "We are not only good at destroying an old world, we will also be good at building a new world."
    The Party's general line for socialist construction is the embodiment of the proletarian's lofty ambition in socialist construction. The slogans put forward by our Party, to catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products in a period shorter than ten years, to realize the National Agricultural Development Program for 1956-1967 ahead of schedule, and to realize the Twelve-Year Science Plan ahead of schedule, are only a part of our socialist construction cause, but the scale of its magnificence and the splendor of its prospects are already clearly visible. Today, when we talk about lofty ambitions, we must first correctly understand the general line and resolutely implement the general line.
    Some people mistakenly believe that lofty ambition is some kind of personal aspiration. Therefore, they are afraid of "standing out." In fact, the lofty ambition we are talking about is the class, the Party's, and the collective's lofty ambition, and its aspiration is that all rivers flow into the sea, leading to communism. The great cause of socialism and communism requires the conscious and active participation of hundreds of millions of people, and requires each region and each unit, according to the needs of the country and the entire people, under the leadership of the Party, to concentrate the strength and wisdom of the region and unit to undertake the task of building socialism and communism, and to develop conscious initiative in revolutionary struggle, developing production, transforming nature, and conquering the universe, and to make the greatest possible contribution. Therefore, every loyal son and daughter of the proletariat must be infinitely loyal to the cause of the proletariat and completely melt their personal aspirations into the cause of the proletariat, the Party, the country, and the people, daring to cherish the greatness of socialism and communism and rejoicing in the merits of socialism and communism. Planning for personal gain and being enthusiastic about personal fame, fortune, and enjoyment are vulgar and unpromising selfish petty aspirations, or a kind of reactionary bourgeois ambition, and are fundamentally not the proletarian's lofty ambition.
    Some people mistakenly believe that lofty ambition is just talking empty words and grandiose rhetoric, or simply talking nonsense, and therefore dare not "express their aspirations." We believe that the proletariat's bold words enhance their own ambition and diminish the enemy's prestige, which is absolutely necessary. At the same time, the proletarian's lofty ambition is a reflection of its historical mission and is in line with the trend of historical development. The proletariat has its own vanguard—the leadership of the Communist Party, the Marxist-Leninist worldview, the guidance of the Party's program, strategy, and tactics, and powerful allies. The proletariat also possesses modern technology. The proletarian's lofty ambition is obviously the most objectively based and is bound to be realized. This is essentially different from any idealistic fantasy, that is, a fantasy that does not conform to objective laws and goes against the trend of social development. Every proletarian fighter should dare to speak of the great aspirations of the class.

### 立无产阶级的雄心壮志

    立无产阶级的雄心壮志
    无产阶级的雄心壮志，他的革命规模，他的革命彻底性，是任何其他阶级都不能有的。从历史上来说，资产阶级在青年时代，虽然也曾有过一点小“志”，即反对封建主义、发展社会生产力的进步性，但是自从工人阶级登上政治舞台、成长壮大起来以后，自从资本主义生产关系成为生产力发展的桎梏以后，这个阶级的进步性就逐步转化为反动性，它腐朽了，没落了，奄奄一息，垂死挣扎，已经没有什么“志气”了。小资产阶级，当它还没有接受无产阶级领导、走共产主义道路的时候，它的志气只不过是对小财主的垂涎而已，至于他们那种“小康之家”的幻境，不过是些很可怜的个人庸碌的打算，根本不能和无产阶级大公无私、气势磅礴的共产主义的雄心壮志相比拟！
    无产阶级进行革命，实现自己的理想，其所经历的斗争过程是漫长的，其所必须推翻的、压在自己头上的东西，是众多而又沉重的。如果缺乏雄心壮志，缺乏不断革命的精神，显然不能适应这种“任重道远”的情况，不足以成大业。所以，无产阶级的雄心壮志是他的阶级地位和历史使命的反映，同时又是经过不断革命来实现他的雄心壮志的。在封建社会里，无产阶级就已经出现。无产阶级是处在社会的最下层。此外还有地主、资产阶级、小资产阶级和半无产阶级。无产阶级要彻底翻身，彻底解放自己，首先，要争取同盟军，要掌握民主革命的领导权，以便在取得民主革命胜利以后，立即转变到社会主义革命。无产阶级进行社会主义革命，又首先要夺取政权，打碎资产阶级的国家机器，建立无产阶级专政，并进而在所有制方面变私有为公有，变个体为集体，还要实现单一的全民所有制。与此同时，无产阶级还必须进行政治思想战线上的彻底的社会主义革命，兴无灭资，以保卫和促进社会主义的经济基础，并在准备物质生产条件的同时，极大地提高人民的共产主义觉悟和道德品质，为过渡到共产主义社会创造政治思想方面的条件。总之，无产阶级一定要经过不断革命，从政治上、经济上、思想上彻底消灭资产阶级和小资产阶级，才能彻底消灭自己无产者的地位，获得彻底的解放。与此相反的，是有些同志在革命的长途中，企图走一步停一步，或者使革命停滞不前，这种种半途而废的思想，就是缺乏无产阶级革命雄心壮志的表现。
    革命和建设是分不开的。当前我国无产阶级的雄心壮志，是把社会主义革命进行到底的雄心壮志，同时也是建设社会主义和共产主义的雄心壮志。党的七届二中全会决议中指出：“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界”。
    我们党的社会主义建设总路线，就是无产阶级雄心壮志在社会主义建设上的体现。我们党所提出的，用比十年更短的时间，在主要工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国的口号，大大提前实现1956—1967年全国农业发展纲要和提前实现十二年科学规划的口号，只不过是我们社会主义建设事业的一部分，但是其规模的宏伟，其前景的壮丽，已经灿然可见。今天，我们讲雄心壮志，首先就要正确理解总路线，坚决贯彻执行总路线。
    有人误以为雄心壮志是什么个人志气。因此怕“冒尖”。其实，我们所说的雄心壮志是阶级的、党的雄心壮志，集体的雄心壮志，其志又万流归宗，通向共产主义。社会主义、共产主义的伟大事业，需要千百万人民群众自觉地积极地参加，需要每个地区、每个单位根据国家和全体人民的需要，在党的领导下，集中本地区、本单位的力量和智慧，把建设社会主义、共产主义的任务担当起来，在革命斗争、发展生产、改造自然、征服宇宙方面，发扬自觉的能动性，尽可能地作出最大的贡献。因此，每个无产阶级的忠实儿女，都必须对无产阶级事业无限忠诚，把个人的志气，完全融化在无产阶级、党、国家和人民的事业当中，敢于好社会主义、共产主义之大，喜社会主义、共产主义之功。为个人打算，热衷于个人的名利和享受，那是庸俗的、没有出息的自私小志，或者是一种反动的资产阶级的野心，根本不是无产阶级的雄心壮志。
    有人误以为雄心壮志只是口头上说说豪言壮语，或者简直就是说空话，因此不敢“言志”。我们认为，无产阶级的豪言壮语长自己的志气，灭敌人的威风，实属必要。同时，无产阶级的雄心壮志，是他的历史使命的反映，是符合于历史发展趋势的。无产阶级有自己的先锋队——共产党的领导，有马克思列宁主义的宇宙观，有党的纲领、战略和策略的指导，有强大的同盟军，无产阶级还掌握着现代技术。无产阶级的雄心壮志，显然是最有客观根据的，是必然要实现的。这和任何唯心主义的空想，即不根据客观规律，逆社会发展趋势之道而行之的空想，有着本质的区别。每一个无产阶级的战士，应当勇于言阶级的大志。
