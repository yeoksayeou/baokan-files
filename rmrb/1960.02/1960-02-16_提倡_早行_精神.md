Advocating the Spirit of "Early Action"
	Liu Di

	Spring came very early this year! Stepping into the vast fields, life is everywhere. The lush wheat seedlings grow vigorously, and the earth is full of vibrant spring. However, the spring in people's hearts came even earlier. We have already awakened the spring with soaring enthusiasm and leaping gongs and drums.

	As early as last winter, we carried out large-scale water conservancy construction, vigorously raised pigs to accumulate fertilizer, and vigorously carried out agricultural tool reforms to prepare for this year's bumper agricultural harvest. As soon as spring arrived, the spring plowing and sowing work from south to north had already formed a climax; thousands of tons of fertilizer were applied to the fields early, and thousands of bumper harvest seeds were sown into the land in a timely manner. As soon as some areas showed a slight sign of spring drought, people immediately started storing and conserving water, setting off a mass spring irrigation campaign. In industrial and mining enterprises, the vigorous production movement is also running ahead of time. 1960 started with good news, and waves of good news of a good start have been heard from the production front; and many advanced producers, just stepping into the gate of 1960, with a leap forward, have already completed the journey of the whole year, and even gone farther and farther. All this means that we have won a "early" character. What is this "early"? Early is to race against time, race for speed, race to the top, and seize the initiative from time and space. Early is the starting point of victory. In our revolutionary work, we must do everything ahead of time, not behind schedule, and do it early rather than late; for everything that is beneficial to the revolution, we must try our best to realize it in advance, the sooner the better. We advocate doing everything early and being ahead in every step, understanding things early, preparing early, acting early, solving problems early, overcoming difficulties early, and completely grasping the initiative in our own hands. Grasping the initiative creates favorable conditions for victory and enables us to leap forward forever. "The plan for a year lies in spring, and the plan for a day lies in the morning." We seize seconds and minutes, minutes and hours, and hours and days, and don't waste a single minute or second. It can be seen how valuable the word "early" is!

	Early has become a characteristic of our times and a communist style of our proletarian revolutionaries. Chairman Mao once wrote in a poem "Qing Ping Yue" ("Huichang"): "The East is about to dawn, don't say the journey is early. Tramping all over the green mountains, people are not old, the scenery here is uniquely good." Our great leader praised the spirit of "early action" of revolutionary fighters in this way with great enthusiasm. Under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, the people of our country have used this spirit of "early action" to engage in all revolutionary undertakings. We are like those revolutionary soldiers on the march, always packing up and embarking on the journey when "the East is about to dawn," persevering in fighting from south to north, traversing thousands of mountains and rivers, and creating the "uniquely good" scenery here. Now, this "uniquely good" "scenery" has already appeared before our eyes; this spirit of "early action" has also been further promoted among the 650 million people. Please look around, how early the victories in our country's socialist construction have come, and how beautiful the scenery of our great motherland is. Haven't the production targets for various constructions in 1959 been greatly achieved in advance! Wasn't the Second Five-Year Plan completed three years ahead of schedule! Originally, it was planned to catch up with Britain in terms of the output of major industrial products in about fifteen years, but now can't it also be completed within ten years! Can't the National Agricultural Development Program also be realized greatly in advance! Early last year, early this year, and early next year. We always face the morning sun, full of vigor, and all good things will appear early in our country.

	We advocate early, which is also advocating scientific foresight; the reason why we do everything early and complete it early is precisely because we have this kind of scientific foresight. We are Marxists, we have revolutionary ambitions, we have vigorous revolutionary energy and a spirit of continuous advancement. Therefore, we stand high, see far, and can fully understand and grasp the laws of the development of things, see today, see tomorrow, see the present, and see the future. "The East is about to dawn," we have already seen the glory of victory and the great scenery. Last year, we saw this year's victory; this year, we saw next year's victory again; the 1950s have just ended, and we have already seen the infinite prospects of the entire 1960s. Things are constantly moving and developing, and we must recognize them early and make ideological preparations early. People often say: one early, a hundred early. This early is "politics in command, ideology first." With this early, we can achieve one early, a hundred early, one step initiative, step by step initiative, one step ahead, step by step occupy the lead, always walk in the front, and always be invincible. When a task is about to be completed, prepare early to complete the next task; when a journey is over, go early to take the next journey; when a victory ends, strive and welcome the next victory early. Every revolutionary must use this far-sighted vision of Marxists, use this spirit of "early action," foresee the future, muster up energy, strive for the top, build socialism early, and realize communism early!

    提倡“早行”精神
    柳笛
    今年的春天来得好早啊！走进辽阔的田野，到处布满生机，郁郁葱葱的麦苗茁壮地生长起来，大地上一片盎然春意。然而，人们心里的春天来得更早，我们用冲天的干劲、用跃进的锣鼓，早已经把春天吵醒了。
  早在去年冬天，我们就大兴水利建设、大力养猪积肥、大搞农具改革，为今年的农业大丰收做好了准备。一进入春季，由南到北的春耕春播工作早已经形成了高潮；千千万万吨肥料提早撒到田里去了，千千万万粒丰收的种子，及时播到土地里了。有些地区的春旱刚刚露出一点苗头，人们就立即动手蓄水、保水，掀起了一个群众性的春灌运动。在工矿企业里，轰轰烈烈的生产运动也早跑在时间的前面。1960年开门见喜，生产战线上传来一阵阵开门红的捷报；而许多先进生产者刚跨入1960年的大门，一声跃进，他们早已走完了全年的路程，甚至走得更远更远了。这一切都意味着我们赢得了一个“早”字。这个“早”是什么？早，就是争时间、争速度、争上游，就是向时间和空间夺取主动权。早，是胜利的起点。在我们的革命工作中，凡事都要赶前不赶后，赶早不赶晚；一切对革命有利的事情，我们都要千方百计地力争提前实现，越早越好。我们主张事事提早，步步赶先，对事物认识得早，早准备、早动手，发现问题早解决，遇到困难早克服，把主动权完全掌握在自己的手中。掌握了主动权，就为胜利创造了有利条件，就能够永远不断地飞跃前进。“一年之计在于春，一日之计在于晨”，我们以秒争分，以分争时，以时夺日，不空放过一分一秒的时间。可见“早”字是多么可贵！
    早，已经成为我们时代的特征，成为我们无产阶级革命者的共产主义风格。毛主席在一首“清平乐”（“会昌”）的词中曾经写道：“东方欲晓，莫道君行早。踏遍青山人未老，风景这边独好。”我们伟大的领袖就是这样热情洋溢地赞颂了革命战士“早行”的精神。我国人民在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，正是用了这种“早行”的精神去从事一切革命事业。我们就像那些行军途中的革命战士们一样，总是在“东方欲晓”的时候，就整装走上征途，坚持不懈地南征北战，踏遍千山万水，创造着“这边独好”的风景。现在，这种“独好”的“风景”，已经呈现在我们眼前了；这种“早行”的精神，也已经在六亿五千万人民中进一步发扬光大了。举目请看，我国社会主义建设事业中一个又一个的胜利来得多么早，我们伟大祖国的风景多么美好。1959年各项建设的生产指标不是大大地提早实现了么！第二个五年计划不是提早三年完成了么！原来准备用十五年左右的时间在主要工业产品产量方面赶上英国，现在不是也可以提早在十年内去完成么！全国农业发展纲要，不是也可以大大提早实现么！去年早，今年早，明年还早。我们永远迎着朝霞，生气蓬勃，一切美好的事物都会在我们的国家里提早出现。
    我们提倡早，也就是提倡科学的预见；我们凡事都做得早，完成得早，也正因为我们具有这种科学预见。我们是马克思主义者，我们有着革命的雄心壮志，有着旺盛的革命干劲和不断前进的精神。因此，我们站得高，望得远，能够充分认识和掌握事物的发展规律，看到今天，也看到明天，看到现在，也看到未来。“东方欲晓”，我们已经看到了胜利的光辉，看到了大好的风景。去年，我们就看到了今年的胜利；今年，我们又看到了明年的胜利；五十年代刚刚结束，我们已经看到了整个六十年代的无限前景。事物在不断地运动和发展着，我们要提早去认识，提早做好思想准备。人们常说：一早百早。这一早，就是“政治挂帅，思想先行”。有了这一早，就可以做到一早百早，一步主动，步步主动，一步在前，步步占先，永远走在前面，永远立于不败之地。一个任务快要完成了，就趁早去准备完成下一个任务；一段路程走完了，就趁早去走下一段路程；一个胜利结束了，又趁早去争取和迎接下一个胜利。每一个革命者都要用马克思主义者的这种远大眼光，用这种“早行”的精神，预见到未来，鼓足干劲，力争上游，早早建成社会主义，早早实现共产主义！
