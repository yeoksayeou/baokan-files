    Our Friendship is Like the Ocean
    Gala Ulanova, Soviet People's Artist, Lenin Prize Winner

    In 1952, I visited China for the first time. We saw the earliest fruits of labor of the liberated people, who created heroic feats that existed only in legends in the past. However, even at that time, perhaps none of us could have foreseen such significant and delightful changes that would occur in these years! Last September, as soon as we stepped onto the magnificent Beijing airport, we were attracted by these tremendous changes.

    How wonderful the ancient Beijing has become! Modern new buildings have been erected in a very short time; on the wide roads, Chinese-made trolleybuses, trucks, and cars are running happily. All this excites us and makes us proud of our friends' achievements. Yes, they are creating a new life. The glorious Chinese Communist Party unites the masses of the people into a unified and harmonious big family.

    What impressed me deeply was that I didn't see anyone idling around in China. Everyone is busy working, everyone is learning, creating, and displaying their talents. The increase in the number of schools, theaters, and clubs is surprising. Last time I was in China, I saw the outstanding dramatist Mei Lanfang and Peking Opera performances. Now I am happy for their new creative achievements. I see more new troupes are born, each with different characteristics. For example, at the Central Experimental Opera House, I really liked their dance drama "The Magic Lotus Lantern." Chinese actors performed this poetic myth, excellently combining the principles of national dance and classical ballet, and the performance was admirable. The actors' movements are soft, natural, and light. The silk dance in it is simply fascinating. These impressions will not disappear without a trace for me as a ballet dancer. Contact with Chinese art expands our knowledge of national dance and broadens our horizons.

    Similar examples are countless: the skills of Chinese actors help us, and the abilities and methods of Soviet actors help them. We see the Beijing Dance School as a miracle. It was only established a few years ago, and now, through the efforts of all teachers and students, it has performed complex classical ballets such as "Swan Lake" and "Le Corsaire." It is also gratifying that Soviet teachers and ballet directors participated in the establishment of this school with remarkable achievements.

    However, is our artistic life's interconnection only reflected in dance? No! In the past ten years, the artistic treasures of China and the Soviet Union have been opened up in our spiritual realm. In our country, the works of Lu Xun and many other Chinese novelists and poets are more widely known, while a large number of books by Russian and Soviet writers are published and distributed in China.

    We also watched with great interest the news about the Beijing China Youth Art Theater's performance of Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya," and we were also happy to learn that the Central Academy of Drama Experimental Theatre performed Ostrovsky's "The Thunderstorm." We are happy to tell our Chinese friends that any book about your country sells very quickly here, which shows how much Soviet readers care about the lives of our powerful friends and allies.

    The success of the tours of various genres of Chinese opera in Moscow and Leningrad is well known. The Guangdong folk band, song and dance troupe, and many musical works familiar to Soviet audiences and listeners have received consistent and universal praise.

    The academic achievements of Chinese students studying in Soviet universities, colleges, and music academies are very precious to us. Guo Shuzhen, a Chinese female student who studied in a vocal class at the Moscow Conservatory under the leadership of Yelena Kadoriskaya, was a winner in the singing competition at the World Youth Festival held in Moscow and Warsaw. This makes her Soviet friends and comrades happy, just like their own achievements.

    These are the facts of the growth, consolidation, and development of our friendship and our cultural ties. These facts are individual examples of many facts, and they are also the first fruits of the past ten years. Such great achievements in this historically short period have aroused people's desire for a better future. I am convinced that in the future ten years of our friendship, we will gain more from each other, because our love and understanding for each other are endless!

    我们的友谊像海洋
    苏联人民演员、列宁奖金获得者  迦·乌兰诺娃
    1952年，我第一次访问中国。我们看到的是解放了的人民的最早的劳动果实，他们创立了过去只在传说中出现的英雄的功勋。但是，即使在那个时候，我们也许都未能预料到，在这几年中会发生这样显著的使人高兴的变化！去年9月，我们一踏上宏伟的北京机场，就被这些巨变吸引住了。
    古老的北京变得多么好啊！现代化的新建筑在非常短的时间内建立了起来；在宽广的马路上，愉快地奔驰着中国产的无轨电车、卡车和小轿车。这一切都使我们激动，为朋友的成就而感到骄傲。是啊，他们正在创造着新生活。光荣的中国共产党把人民群众团结在一个统一的和睦的大家庭里。
    给我印象很深的是，我在中国没有看见闲荡的人。每个人都忙着工作，每个人都在学习、创造，发挥着自己的才能。学校、戏院、俱乐部数量的增长，使人感到惊讶。上次在中国，我曾见过杰出的戏剧家梅兰芳和京剧的演出，现在我为他们的新的创造性的成就而感到高兴。我看到更多的新剧团诞生了，它们都有着不同的特点。例如，在中央实验歌剧院，我很喜欢他们演出的舞剧“宝莲灯”。中国演员们演出了这个诗一般的神话，卓越地结合了民族舞蹈和古典芭蕾的原理，演出令人赞赏不已。演员的动作柔软，自然，又轻快。其中的绸舞简直是令人神往。这些印象，对作为一个芭蕾演员的我，是不会无踪影地消失的。同中国艺术的接触，扩大了我们在民族舞蹈方面的知识，开阔了我们的眼界。
    类似的例子是不胜枚举的：中国演员的技艺帮助着我们，苏联演员的本领和方法帮助着他们。我们看北京舞蹈学校就像是一个奇迹。几年以前它才建立，现在，由全体教师和学生的努力已经演出了像“天鹅湖”和“海侠”那样复杂的古典芭蕾。苏联教员和芭蕾导演参加了这个有显著成绩的学校的建立，也是使人高兴的事。
    然而，难道我们艺术生活的相互联系只是反映在舞蹈方面吗？不！最近十年来，在我们的精神领域里打开了中国的和苏联的艺术宝库。在我国，鲁迅和许多许多其他中国的小说家和诗人的作品更普遍地为大家所知道，而在中国大批地出版发行俄国和苏联作家的书籍。
    我们也以很大的兴趣看了关于北京中国青年艺术剧院上演契呵夫的“万尼亚舅舅”的消息，我们也高兴地知道中央戏剧学院实验话剧院演出了奥斯特罗夫斯基的“大雷雨”。我们愉快地告诉中国朋友们，任何一本关于你们国家的书籍在我们这里都销得非常快，它说明苏联的读者对我们强大的朋友和盟国的生活多么关心。
    各种不同流派的中国戏曲在莫斯科和列宁格勒的巡回演出所获得的成功是众所周知的。苏联的观众和听众所熟悉的广东民间乐队、歌舞团和许多音乐作品，都得到了始终如一的普遍的称赞。
    在苏联的大学、专科学院、音乐学院学习的中国学生的学习成绩对我们是十分珍贵的。曾在由叶列娜·卡多里斯卡雅领导的莫斯科音乐学院的一个声乐班里学习的中国女学生郭淑贞，是在莫斯科和华沙举行的世界青年联欢节歌唱比赛的获奖者。这件事使她的苏联朋友和同志感到高兴，就像他们自己的成就一样。
    这些都是我们的友谊，我们的文化联系的增长、巩固和发展的事实。这些事实是许多事实中个别的例子，也是过去十年的第一批的成果。在这个从历史上看来是很短的时期中达到的这样大的成绩，激起了人们对未来最美好生活的愿望。我深信，在我们友谊的未来的十年中，彼此将得到更多的东西，因为我们相互之间的热爱和理解，是永无止境的！
