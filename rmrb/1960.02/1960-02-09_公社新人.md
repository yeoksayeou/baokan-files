The branch secretary of the commune, Wu Songbai, is in everyone's heart, and everyone is in her heart. Thousands of acres of fertile land and thousands of mountains are her home.
De Yin, De Ba, (Note 1) A Mi, A Ba, (Note 2) are her brothers and sisters, her parents.
Before the stars have fallen, she unveils the early morning glow. While white snow is still drifting, she brings the spring flowers.
When the drought demon arrives, she beats the war drum. When people are lost at the crossroads, she conveys the Party's words.
Chopping firewood and cooking, she became the "Minister of Logistics." Rolling up her trouser legs, she became a leaping horse of the Great Leap Forward.
She loves to sing Miao songs and can also embroider,
"Socialism is good!" Sing it, embroider it.
(Note 1) Miao language: Man, girl. (Note 2) Miao language: Mother, father.

“Mother Hen” Mao Qi
Every day, every day...
She gets up early and goes to bed late. Already over fifty years old, her life still seems like spring.
She was the first to open the cattle pen, she was the first to boil water in the cafeteria, and then she woke up the male and female commune members, and spread songs and laughter all over the fields.
The morning star doesn't get up as early as she does, only appearing on the horizon when the east turns white. The sun doesn't get up as early as she does, and its face turns red with shame when it sees her.
It is the people's commune that brings her warmth, and the Great Leap Forward that ignites the sparks in her heart. The commune members affectionately call her "Mother Hen," praising her for being ahead of the times.

Late-Night Story
Xiao Mengzhang
"Hua Yao" is about to give birth to piglets, and the old breeder can't sleep:
First, he's afraid that "Hua Yao" has no "experience" and will trample the piglets to death;
Second, he's afraid of a difficult labor, which will hurt the mother pig even more;
Third, he thinks the pig is the treasure of the commune, more important than his own heart...
Putting on his pants and coat, he runs to the pigsty every now and then...
The old woman wakes up groggily and asks: "Are you feeling cold and have a stomachache?"
The old man's mind is on the pig, and he thinks the old woman is asking about "Hua Yao";
He thinks his wife is so kind, thinking about the pig even more than he does: "...Go to sleep, Mother of the children, I'll take care of it, nothing will go wrong. I can tell if the pig has a stomachache..."

    公社新人支部书记吴松柏大家心里有她，她心里有大家，千亩良田千重山，就是她的家。得银、得拔，（注一）阿咪、阿爸，（注二）是她的兄妹，是她的爹妈。星星未坠，她揭开了早霞，白雪正飘，她带来了春花。旱魔降临，她擂起了战鼓；人们迷在十字街头，她传达了党的话。劈柴作饭，当上“后勤部长”，挽起裤脚，成了跃进的骏马。她爱唱苗歌，还会绣花，
  “社会主义好！”唱它，绣它。（注一）苗语：男子、姑娘。（注二）苗语：母亲、父亲。“公鸡妈妈”毛　锜每天，每天……她起的早睡的晚，已经五十多岁了，生命还仿佛是春天。是她第一个打开牛栏，是她最早在食堂把水烧煎，然后把男女社员唤醒，把歌声笑语洒满田间。启明星没她起的早，东方发白才闪现在天边，太阳没她起的早，看见她便羞红了脸。是人民公社给她带来温暖，是大跃进把她心中的火花点燃，社员们亲切的称她“公鸡妈妈”，赞扬她走在了时间的前面。深夜里的故事萧孟璋“花腰”要下头窝崽儿，老饲养员睡不着觉：一怕“花腰”没“经验”，踩死猪娃不得了；二怕万一是难产，伤了母猪更糟糕；三想猪是公社的宝，比起心尖儿还重要……。穿着裤子套上袄，一会一趟往猪圈跑………。老伴惊醒蒙矓问：“是你着凉肚子疼了？”老人心在猪身上，只当老伴问“花腰”；心想老伴可真好，替猪想的比我还周到：“……睡吧，孩子他妈，有我照看错不了。猪的肚子疼不疼，老头我也能知道……。”
