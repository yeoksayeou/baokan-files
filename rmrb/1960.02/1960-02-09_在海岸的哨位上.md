    On a Coastal Outpost
    Not long ago, one night, thick clouds covered the sky. The militiamen of the Second Squad, Third Platoon, in a certain place on the Fujian Front stood at their battle posts, watching the sea, listening intently for any suspicious sounds in the roar of the waves.
    Suddenly, the militiamen noticed vague, dark shadows on the sea not far away. One militiaman tugged at the sleeve of the coast defense soldier who was on sentry duty with him. The soldier and militiaman, with rich combat experience, immediately took a few steps back, preparing to capture the enemy. Two other militiamen, driving a small boat, circled behind the enemy, preparing to cut off his escape route.
    The dark shadow slowly swam towards the shore, and when it got close to the shallows, it suddenly sank into the sea. The militiamen knew that this was a cunning plot by the enemy and continued to monitor the sea closely. After a while, the coast defense sentries heard a slight noise coming from the area densely covered with reefs. Everyone held their breath, fingers on the triggers, waiting for the enemy to come ashore. Ten minutes later, with a slight sound of footsteps, a person appeared among the reefs, slowly walking towards the shore. As soon as he landed, several gun muzzles with sharp bayonets surrounded him, and a Chiang Kai-shek gang special agent was trapped in the dragnet of the people's armed forces. (Xinhua News Agency)

    在海岸的哨位上
    不久前的一天夜里，密云笼罩着天空，福建前线某地三排二班的民兵们站在战斗岗位上，注视着海面，静听海涛呼啸中有没有可疑的声音。
    突然民兵们发现在不远的海面上有模模糊糊的黑影，一个民兵拉了一下同他一起放哨的海防战士的衣襟。有丰富斗争经验的战士和民兵，立即向后退了几步，摆开了准备捕捉敌人的阵势。另外两个民兵，驾着一只小船绕到敌人后面，准备切断他逃跑的后路。
    那个黑影慢慢向海岸泅来，快到浅水的地方，忽然沉到海里。民兵们知道这是敌人的狡猾阴谋，继续严密监视着海面。一会，海防哨兵们听到礁石密布的地方传来一下轻微的响声，大家都屏住呼吸，扣着枪机，等待敌人上岸。十来分钟之后，随着轻微的脚步声，礁石群中出现了一个人，慢慢向海岸走来。他刚刚上岸，几枝带着锋利刺刀的枪口把他团团围住，一个蒋介石集团特务被人民武装的天罗地网缚住了。　（新华社）
