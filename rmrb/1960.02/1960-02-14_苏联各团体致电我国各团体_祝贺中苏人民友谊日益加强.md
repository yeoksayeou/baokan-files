Dear friends, we heartily congratulate you on your new achievements in our common struggle for lasting peace in the world. We wish the remarkable and effective cooperation between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China in all aspects will continue to develop in the future, and we wish the eternal and unbreakable fraternal friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China—the guarantee of lasting world peace—will continue to strengthen and prosper in the future."

    **The Soviet Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee's Congratulatory Telegram**

    Xinhua News Agency, February 13th. The Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee received a telegram from the Soviet Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee congratulating on the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance.

    The telegram said: "The past ten years have been a brilliant example of remarkable and effective cooperation and mutual assistance between the two great brothers in all aspects of life, and a vivid manifestation of the unbreakable friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China, who are advancing by leaps and bounds along the bright path to communism. Dear comrades, the Soviet Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee is heartily delighted with your tremendous achievements in developing the economy, improving science and culture, and in socialist construction. The Sino-Soviet Treaty is a reliable guarantee of peace and security for all peoples. It stands like an indestructible barrier, blocking the path of those who want to prolong the already decaying imperialist colonial system at any cost, and blocking the path of those who cling to the outdated 'Cold War' policy, hinder the easing of international tensions, and hinder the strengthening of peace and unity among nations. We heartily wish you new and greater achievements in socialist construction. May the eternal friendship between our two peoples continue to strengthen and develop!"
