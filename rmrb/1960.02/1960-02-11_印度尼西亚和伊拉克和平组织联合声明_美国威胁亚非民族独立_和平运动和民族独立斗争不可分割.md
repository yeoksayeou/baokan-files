Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 9th: The Indonesian Peace Committee and the Iraqi National Committee of Peace Fighters recently issued a joint statement, emphasizing the need to heighten vigilance and make persistent efforts, calling on world peace forces to take concerted action to strive for lasting world peace.

The joint statement was signed by Mrs. Hidayat, Chairman of the Indonesian Peace Committee, and Aziz Sharif, Secretary-General of the Iraqi National Committee of Peace Fighters.

The joint statement pointed out that the imperialist forces, colluding with reactionaries and pro-imperialist groups in some Asian and African countries to conclude new bilateral military treaties, are threatening the national independence of the Asian and African people, and subjecting the people of these countries to oppression, intimidation, and the disruption of subversive activities. The statement also said that these military treaties, which give the United States almost unlimited freedom to expand existing military bases in Asia and Africa, and to build new military bases equipped with atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, hinder the peaceful development of the Asian and African people.

The joint statement mentioned the imperialist plot to undermine the national independence and sovereignty of Indonesia and Iraq, and to sabotage world peace, and the two sides expressed their views on the problems facing the peace movements in Indonesia and Iraq. The statement emphasized that the security of Indonesia and Iraq is inseparable from the struggle of people all over the world for peace, security, and national independence. The people of the two countries will unswervingly continue their struggle for peace and against the activities of imperialism and reactionaries.

    印度尼西亚和伊拉克和平组织联合声明
    美国威胁亚非民族独立
    和平运动和民族独立斗争不可分割
    据新华社雅加达9日电　印度尼西亚和平委员会和伊拉克和平战士全国委员会最近发表一项联合声明，强调必须提高警惕，进行坚持不懈的努力，要求世界和平力量采取一致行动以争取世界的持久和平。
    在联合声明上签字的是印度尼西亚和平委员会主席希达雅特夫人和伊拉克和平战士全国委员会秘书长阿齐兹·谢里夫。
    联合声明指出，由于帝国主义力量勾结若干亚非国家的反动派和亲帝国主义集团，缔结新的双边军事条约，这威胁着亚非人民的民族独立，并且使这些国家的人民遭受压迫、恐吓以及颠覆活动的破坏。声明还说，由于这些军事条约使美国几乎有无限的自由在亚洲和非洲扩大现有的军事基地，并且建造装备着原子武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的新的军事基地，这些条约妨碍了亚非人民的和平发展。
    联合声明提到了帝国主义企图破坏印度尼西亚和伊拉克的民族独立和主权以及破坏世界和平的阴谋，双方对有关印度尼西亚和伊拉克的和平运动所面临的问题的看法。声明强调说，印度尼西亚和伊拉克的安全同全世界人民争取和平和安全的民族独立的斗争是不可分割的。两国人民将始终不渝地继续进行斗争，争取和平和反对帝国主义和反动派的活动。
