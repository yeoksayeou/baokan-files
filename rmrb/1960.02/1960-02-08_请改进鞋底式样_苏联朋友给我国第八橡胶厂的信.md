    Please Improve the Shoe Sole Style
    ——A Letter from Soviet Friends to China's Eighth Rubber Factory
    Dear Comrades:
    In the summer of 1958, we bought Double Ball brand low-cut and high-cut sneakers produced by your factory in Almaty.
    In many years of mountaineering, we have dealt with many brands of sneakers, but none of them are as good as those from your factory. The soles of the sneakers produced by your factory are very soft and elastic, making it very convenient to walk in the mountains; they are also not cramped at all, and the toes are very free and comfortable inside; as for the soles of the sneakers, they are very wear-resistant even under harsh mountain walking conditions. During the two summer mountaineering seasons of 1958 and 1959, one pair of sneakers from your factory could last as long as two or three pairs of other brands. However, the only shortcoming is that the fabric of the upper sometimes easily comes off. Furthermore, although the high-cut sneaker soles can prevent slipping on snowy rock walls or wet ground, they can only maintain non-slip in one direction (such as walking straight up or down the rock wall). If you walk horizontally along the slope, it cannot prevent your feet from slipping. This kind of slipping is likely to occur even for athletes who are not engaged in mountaineering when they suddenly tilt their bodies to the side.
    It would be good if you could change the pattern of the sole's bottom surface to eliminate the possibility of side slip. For example, it can be made into the style of the sole of Czech hiking shoes. According to memory, the shape is roughly as shown in Figure 1, or for simplicity, it can be made as shown in Figure 2, or other forms. Of course, the depth of the sole pattern should not be less than five millimeters.
    We believe that this change to the sole will be very beneficial for people engaged in any kind of sport.
    We would be very happy if this letter could be of slight help to the quality improvement of the products of your factory – the Eighth Rubber Factory of the great people of China.

### 请改进鞋底式样——苏联朋友给我国第八橡胶厂的信

    请改进鞋底式样
    ——苏联朋友给我国第八橡胶厂的信
    敬爱的同志们：
    1958年夏天，我们在阿拉木图城买了您们厂生产的双球牌短帮及高帮球鞋。
    在多年的登山运动中，我们曾和许多牌号的球鞋打过交道，然而都不及您们厂的好。您们厂生产的球鞋，鞋底很柔软，富有弹性，在山间行走非常方便；穿起来也一点不挤脚指，脚指在里边非常自由舒服；至于球鞋的鞋底，即使在恶劣的山间行走条件下，也很耐磨。在1958年和1959年的两个夏天登山季节中，您们厂的球鞋一双能顶其他牌号的球鞋两、三双用。不过，美中不足的就是鞋帮的布织物有时还容易脱落。再就是，高帮球鞋鞋底虽然在多雪的岩壁上或潮湿的地上能使脚不滑，但仅能在一个方向上保持不滑动（如沿岩壁直上或直下行走），假如沿坡横走，就不能使脚不滑动了。这种滑动，即使对非从事登山运动的运动员来说，当他们要向侧面使身体突然倾侧时，也是很可能发生的。
    如果您们能改变一下鞋底的底面图形，以便消除侧滑的可能性，那就好了。例如，可做成捷克旅行鞋鞋底的式样。根据记忆，形状大致如图1所示，或者为了简便起见，可做成如图2所示，抑或其他形式。当然鞋底图形的深度应不小于五毫米。
    我们觉得鞋底的这种改变，对从事任何种运动的人来说都是很有益的。
    假如这封信能对您们厂——伟大人民中国的第八橡胶厂的产品质量改进略有帮助的话，我们将感到很高兴。
