The Secret of Penguins Raising Their Young

Even in the harsh Arctic winter, when the temperature drops to over sixty degrees Celsius below zero, it does not prevent penguins from giving birth and raising their offspring. Why doesn't the penguins' eggs freeze to death?

Scientists once conducted an interesting experiment. They found two newly laid eggs in a penguin's nest. They took one of the eggs out of the nest, opened the eggshell, poured out the egg white and yolk, and installed a tiny thermometer and radio transmitter inside the broken eggshell. Then they reassembled the two halves of the eggshell and placed it back in its original location. When the fake egg returned between the mother penguin's paws, the instrument inside the egg automatically reported the egg's temperature to the Arctic station every fifteen minutes. The results proved that even during storms or extremely cold weather, the average temperature of the penguin egg was always around 39.6 degrees Celsius.

    企鹅生育子女的秘密
    即使是在北极的严冬里，气温降到摄氏零下六十多度时，也妨碍不了企鹅生儿育女。为什么企鹅的卵不会冻死呢？
    科学家曾做过一次有趣的实验。他们在企鹅的巢穴中找到两个刚产下的卵。自巢中取出其中一个卵，将蛋壳剖开，倾出蛋清和蛋黄后，用极细小的温度计和无线电讯号机装进碎卵壳里，再将两半卵壳符合，并放回原处。当假卵重新回到母鹅的两爪间，卵中仪器每隔十五分钟自动向北极站报告一次卵中温度，结果证明：甚至在风暴或极寒的天气里，企鹅卵的平均温度总在摄氏39．6度左右。
