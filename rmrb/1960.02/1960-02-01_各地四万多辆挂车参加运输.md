    Over 40,000 Trailers Across the Country Participate in Transportation
    (Our Dispatch) The implementation of truck trailerization in road transport across various regions has significantly improved highway transport capacity. Currently, over 47,000 trailers are participating in transportation nationwide, with a carrying capacity equivalent to more than 30,000 Liberation brand trucks.

    Due to the widespread implementation of trailer transport, vehicle-ton output has been continuously improving across the country. According to statistics from Shandong, Hunan, Jiangxi, and other provinces, the average vehicle-ton monthly output has exceeded 8,000 ton-kilometers.

    Over the past year, the motor transport departments have created and accumulated a wealth of experience in organizing trailer transport based on specific conditions such as the distribution of goods, the length of haul, the volume of transport, the power performance and technical condition of the vehicles, loading and unloading capacity, road conditions, and repair and maintenance equipment. On routes with concentrated shipping points and dispersed unloading points, they have promoted "en-route drop-and-hook transport," that is, goods from several units with the same starting point and same route direction but not the same unloading point are arranged in order according to the arrival station, loaded and bulk-trailed at the shipping point, and then sequentially dropped off at each unloading point along the way; when the vehicles return, all the trailers that have been unloaded and loaded along the way are sequentially brought back. On transport routes with fixed sources of goods, short transport distances, and long waiting times for loading and unloading, the "round-trip drop-and-hook" method has been implemented, that is, a portion of trailers are placed at each of the loading and unloading points, pre-loaded or pre-unloaded, and the vehicles travel back and forth between the two ends, circulating and operating, so that the vehicles are always running in a cycle of dropping off loaded trailers and hooking up empty trailers, or dropping off empty trailers and hooking up loaded trailers, so as not to cause them to run in the middle and be stuck at both ends due to waiting for loading and unloading.

    各地四万多辆挂车参加运输
    本报讯　各地汽车运输实行汽车列车化后，在提高公路运输能力方面起了显著作用。目前，全国已有四万七千多辆挂车参加运输，载重能力相当于三万多辆解放牌汽车。
    由于普遍实行了拖挂车运输，全国各地车吨产量不断提高。据山东、湖南、江西等省的统计，平均车吨月产量都超过了八千吨公里。
    一年来，汽车运输部门根据货源的分布、运距的远近、运量的大小、车辆的动力性能和技术状况、装卸能力、道路条件以及修理保养设备等具体情况，创造和积累了丰富的组织拖挂运输的经验。在发货点集中、卸货点分散的线路上，他们推行了“沿途甩挂运输”，即在同一起点、同一路线方向而不是同一卸货地点的几个单位的货物，按照到达站点的先后，依次排列，分别在发货地点装车和整批拖挂，然后在沿途各卸货地点顺序甩卸；汽车回程时再将沿途已经卸完装好的挂车，全部顺序带回。在货源固定、运距较短、待装待卸时间较长的运输线路上，实行了“轮回甩挂”办法，即在装货卸货地点各放一部分挂车，预先装好或卸好，汽车在两头之间往返拖挂，巡回运转，汽车总是在甩下重车、挂上空车或甩下空车、挂上重车的情况下，周而复始地运行，不致因等待装卸造成跑在中间、窝在两头。
