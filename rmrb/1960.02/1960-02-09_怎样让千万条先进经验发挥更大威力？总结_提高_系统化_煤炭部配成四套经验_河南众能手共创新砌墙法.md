How to Unleash the Greater Power of Thousands of Advanced Experiences?
	Summarize　Improve　Systematize
	Ministry of Coal Distributes Four Sets of Experiences; Henan's Skilled Workers Jointly Create New Bricklaying Method
    (Our Tianjin dispatch, February 8th) The Ministry of Coal Industry recently systematized and standardized the advanced experiences that emerged from various regions concerning the maintenance of electric conveyors, moving electric conveyors, supporting pillars, and retrieving pillars, four types of work. It has summarized four relatively complete sets of experiences and decided to promote them comprehensively this year.
    These four sets of experiences are: safe operation of electric conveyors, rapid movement of electric conveyors, safe and rapid pillar support, and safe and rapid high-recovery pillar retrieval. Promoting these experiences will play an important role in solving the key problems of current coal mine production and achieving continued leap forward in coal production this year.
    At present, in mechanized coal mines, equipment accidents occur most frequently with coal-carrying electric conveyors. The experience of safe electric conveyor operation created in various regions can not only greatly reduce accidents, but also further prevent them. For example, Song Shaoxian, an electrical and mechanical repair worker from Kailuan Zhaogezhuang Mine who attended the National Conference of Heroes last year, mastered the equipment's performance and laws, creating a set of "prevention-oriented" equipment maintenance methods. In the case of old equipment and poor coal seam conditions, he managed to eliminate thirty-minute accidents.
    Shortening the time for moving electric conveyors is one of the important guarantees for ensuring multi-cycle operations on coal mining faces and achieving large-area high yields. Wang Fengyuan of Kailuan Linxi Mine, Jiang Caiji of Hegang Mining Bureau Nanshan Mine, and Li Shengde of Datong No. 4 Mine, and other conveyor moving workers, created rapid conveyor moving methods such as segmented, sectionalized, and cross-operation as well as mechanized and automated head and tail. Moving the Type 11 electric conveyor generally takes no more than thirty minutes, and some have reduced it to just over ten minutes, reducing the time for general workers to move electric conveyors by more than half, and the quality of moving and laying conveyors has reached flat, straight, stable, and safe operation.
    Pit wood is the main material in coal mine production and is also used in large quantities, so saving pit wood is of great significance. Since last year, coal mines in various regions have created many pillar retrieval methods that are fast and improve the recovery rate of pit wood, increasing the recovery rate of pit wood from 70% to 80% in the past to more than 90%, and greatly improving pillar retrieval efficiency. Zhang Wen, a pillar retrieval worker at Kailuan Zhaogezhuang Mine, created thirteen pillar retrieval methods such as single rope head, multiple rope head, triangle, and segmented methods under different conditions. The recovery rate of pit wood increased from 85% to 98%, and the reuse rate increased from 92% to 94%, and a pit wood could be recovered every minute.
    In terms of pillar support, coal mines in various regions have created many safe and rapid pillar support experiences. Li Yuedong, a pillar support worker at Jiaozuo Mining Bureau Wangfeng Coal Mine, adopted various advanced pillar support methods according to different geological conditions. For example, the overhead hoisting station bolt support method he created increased the number of supports per shift for four people from eleven in the past to one hundred and ten, while ensuring safe production.
    The Ministry of Coal Industry has summarized these four aspects of experience into relatively systematic and complete experiences. In order to make advanced experience blossom quickly and universally, the Ministry of Coal Industry has decided to establish several advanced experience transmission stations in each collaboration area, province, mining bureau, and larger mine, and has recently selected fifty-seven national pacesetters from these four types of work to form six advanced experience dissemination teams. The pacesetter workers of the dissemination teams, after a short period of training, will take complete sets of experience and go to various transmission stations to give on-site demonstrations.

    (According to Henan Daily) The Henan Provincial Basic Construction Committee, Construction Engineering Department, and Construction Trade Union recently jointly held an advanced bricklaying technology performance conference. One hundred and thirty-two skilled bricklayers from the province's construction engineering department, railways, textiles, coal, grain, and other systems performed operations on four construction sites, extensively exchanged advanced bricklaying technology experience, and formulated a relatively systematic and complete set of Henan Province's "Six-Zero Bricklaying Method."
    The characteristics of the "Six-Zero Bricklaying Method" are: advanced operation methods, reasonable labor organization, complete sets of advanced machinery, reasonable construction technology, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and suitable for widespread promotion. The content includes: bricklaying, transportation, scaffolding, pointing, mortar mixing, and construction organization, six parts. The main points of the "Six-Zero Bricklaying Method" are: in terms of bricklaying, promote methods such as three-brick squeezing, double-brick squeezing, three-brick splitting, single-brick squeezing, and multi-brick parallel laying; in terms of tools, use ladle-type mortar spreaders, dustpan-type mortar spreaders, and mortar spreaders; in terms of transportation, promote indigenous and foreign combined winches and trolley transportation. In other aspects such as scaffolding, bricklaying pointing, and construction organization, some advanced experiences have also been summarized.

    怎样让千万条先进经验发挥更大威力？
    总结　提高　系统化
    煤炭部配成四套经验　河南众能手共创新砌墙法
    本报天津8日电　煤炭工业部最近把各地涌现出来的有关电溜子维护、移电溜子、支柱、回柱等四个工种的先进经验，经过定型、配套，总结出了四套较完整的经验，决定在今年全面推广。
    这四套经验是：电溜子安全运转，快速移电溜子，安全快速支柱和安全快速高回收回柱。推广这些经验，对于解决当前煤矿生产的关键问题，实现今年煤炭生产的继续跃进将起重要作用。
    目前，各地机械化开采的煤矿，发生设备事故最多的是运煤的电溜子。各地已创造的电溜子安全运转的经验，不仅能够大大减少事故，而且可以进一步作到避免发生事故。如去年出席全国群英会的开滦赵各庄矿机电检修工宋绍先，由于掌握了设备的性能和规律，创造出以“预防为主”的一套设备维护方法，在设备老、煤层条件不好的情况下，作到了消灭三十分钟的事故。
    缩短移动电溜子的时间，是保证采煤工作面实现多循环作业，达到大面积高产的重要保证之一。开滦林西矿的王凤元、鹤岗矿务局南山矿的姜才基、大同四矿李生德等移溜子工人，创造了分段分节流水交叉作业及机头机尾机械化自动化等快速移溜子法，在移动十一型电溜子时一般都不超过三十分钟，有的已减少到十几分钟，比目前一般工人移电溜子的时间减少一半以上，而且移铺溜子的质量达到了平，直，稳，安全运转。
    坑木是煤矿生产中的主要材料，同时用量很大，节约坑木有重大意义。去年以来，各地煤矿创造了许多速度快又能提高坑木回收率的回柱方法，使坑木的回收率由过去的70％到80％提高到90％以上，而且大大提高了回柱效率。开滦赵各庄矿回柱工人张文在不同的条件下，创造出单绳头、多绳头、三角、分段等十三种回柱法，坑木的回收率由85％提高到98％，复用率由92％提高到94％，每一分钟就能回收出一棵坑木。
    在支柱方面，各地煤矿创造了许多安全快速支柱的经验。焦作矿务局王封煤矿支柱工人李跃东，根据不同的地质条件，采用了多种先进的支柱方法。如他创造的空中吊站支螺栓办法，四个人一小班支架由过去的数量十一个提高到一百一十个，而且保证了安全生产。
    煤炭工业部已经将这四个方面的经验总结成比较系统完整的经验。为了使先进经验迅速地普遍地开花结果，煤炭工业部决定在各协作区、省、矿务局以及较大的矿建立若干个先进经验传授站，并已将最近评选出来的这四个工种的五十七名全国标兵，组成六个先进经验传播队。传播队的标兵工人，经过短期的培训，将带着成套的经验，分赴各地传授站作现场表演。
    据河南日报消息　河南省基本建设委员会、建筑工程厅、建筑工会最近联合召开了先进砌墙技术表演大会。来自全省建筑工程厅、铁路、纺织、煤炭、粮食等系统的一百三十二名砌墙能手，在四个工地进行了操作表演，广泛地交流了先进砌墙技术经验，制定了一套较为系统完整的河南省“六零砌墙法”。
    “六零砌墙法”的特点是：操作方法先进，劳动组织合理，先进机具成套，施工工艺合理，有土有洋，适宜于普遍推广。内容包括：砌墙、运输、脚手、勾缝、灰浆搅拌及施工组织等六个部分。“六零砌墙法”的主要点是：在砌墙方面推广三砖并挤法、双砖并挤法、三砖分挤法、单砖挤砌法、多砖并砌法等；工具方面，使用瓢式铺灰器、簸箕式铺灰器和铺灰耙等；在运输方面 ，推广土洋结合的卷扬机和车子化运输。其它在脚手，砌墙勾缝、施工组织等方面，也总结了一些先进经验。
