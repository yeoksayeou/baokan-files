People often use the expression "rack one's brains" to describe tracing to the source, trying every possible means, using one's brain, and thinking of solutions. In fact, "mind" is something that can never be exhausted.

Wei Gaohou, a milling machine operator at the Chongqing Chang'an Machine Factory, innovated twelve technologies on the very first day of this year, completing the workload of one year and two days. You might say he racked his brains, right? But he believes that the more a person uses their brain, the better it works, and the more tricks they find, the more production potential should be tapped. So, he continued to dig, and as a result, he innovated many more technologies. By January 7th, he had implemented a total of twenty-two innovative suggestions, completing the equivalent of three years and twenty-three days of work. Does this mean he has exhausted his mind? No, he aims to implement 750 innovative suggestions this year and strive to complete an even greater workload. The hero's oath will certainly be realized, and we believe that even greater potential will be tapped. This is how "mind" works. Like an endless treasure, it cannot be exhausted and becomes richer the more it is tapped.

A worker comrade put it well: Production potential is like a well, the deeper you dig, the more water you get. It is not like water in a cup, the more you drink, the less there is. The spring of thought flows continuously, and small streams can converge into a vast ocean, transforming into infinite power. To keep digging is to continuously muster effort and achieve continuous leaps forward. To dig, one must have a strong revolutionary will and perseverance, revolutionary ambitions, and full enthusiasm. Laggards and cowards who dare not think or do anything do not have the spirit of tapping into the treasure trove of thought, and naturally, they cannot unearth infinite wisdom and great power from the treasure trove of thought. Therefore, whether one has the spirit of continuous leaps forward in revolutionary work and the drive to maximize subjective initiative is a reflection of whether one has a revolutionary proletarian worldview.

Why can't the mind be exhausted? Because we are Marxists. We arm ourselves with Marxism-Leninism. In our view, the development and changes of objective things are ceaseless and endless; people's understanding of objective things is also gradually improving, deepening, and becoming more complete. With the continuous improvement of understanding of the laws of the development of things, people will increasingly enhance their ability to transform nature and conquer nature. Therefore, people's minds can never be exhausted, and they become richer the more they are tapped. The reason why the water in the well is inexhaustible is that, in addition to the need for continuous digging, most importantly, it is interconnected with sources from all directions, it is not static or stagnant. The practice of human history has proved that the development of productive forces has no end, and the fact that China's socialist construction is developing at a high speed also proves this truth. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, under the brilliant light of the General Line, the people of the whole country have broken down superstitions, liberated their minds, and promoted the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do. Mao Zedong Thought has increasingly deeply grasped the 600 million people, forming an incomparably huge revolutionary drive. Everyone digs into their minds and musters effort; and effort promotes the richness of the mind. People's effort is mustered again and again, and production efficiency is improved repeatedly. Thus, we see the tremendous creative power like the rolling Yangtze River, wave upon wave, peak after peak, endless waves surging forward with overwhelming force. It promotes the high-speed development of China's socialist construction. The rich source of the mind is Mao Zedong Thought, which creatively applies Marxism to China's reality. Without this source, the mind would only wither.

We say that the mind cannot be exhausted because a person's "mind" does not exist in isolation from reality. Like the water in the well, it is connected to objective things and collective wisdom. As long as people maintain close ties with the masses, connect with reality, and learn modestly, their "mind" will become richer. Wei Gaohou's "mind" is rich because he not only gained wisdom from the education of the Party and generated wisdom from his own efforts but also absorbed wisdom from the masses. He learned 96 advanced technical experiences by participating in one "gathering of heroes" and then implemented them all in the shortest possible time. Human wisdom is infinite, and the wisdom of the masses is even more infinite.

We regard production potential as a never-drying well and as the ever-flowing Yangtze River because we believe that human power is infinite. In the eyes of revolutionaries, no happiness or beauty is spontaneously bestowed by nature but is taken from nature by people through struggle. People's subjective initiative always plays a decisive role in the development of social production. Under the socialist system, the people truly become the masters of society and nature, and this role becomes even more obvious. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "Introducing a Cooperative": "In addition to the leadership of the Party, 600 million people are a decisive factor." Therefore, as long as we establish lofty ambitions, muster enough effort, and strive for the upstream, we can fully utilize favorable conditions and always move forward, always be victorious.

The mind cannot be exhausted, the potential cannot be used up, and our leap forward will never stop. Let us firmly grasp the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought and strive to tap into the treasure trove of thought!

### 挖不空的心思

    挖不空的心思
    柳笛
    人们常常把追本穷源，千方百计，动脑筋、想办法，形容为“挖空心思”。其实，“心思”是永远也挖不空的。
    重庆长安机器厂铣工魏高厚，在今年的头一天革新了十二项技术，完成了一年零两天的工作量。你说他也许挖空心思了吧？可是他认为人的脑子越用越好用，窍门越找越多，生产潜力要一挖再挖。于是，他继续挖下去，结果又革新了好多项技术，到1月7日止共实现了二十二项革新建议，完成了相当于三年零二十三天的工作量。难道这就算挖空了吗？没有，他要在今年一年中，实现革新建议七百五十项，争取完成更巨大的工作量。英雄的誓言一定能实现，我们相信还会挖出更大的潜力来。“心思”就是这样，它像无尽的宝藏一样挖不空，而且愈挖愈丰富。
    有一位工人同志说得好：生产潜力是一口井，越挖越深，越挖水越多，它不是杯子里的水，越喝越少。思想的清泉川流不息，涓涓细流可以汇成巨大的海洋，化为无穷的力量。不断地挖，也就是不断地鼓足干劲，实现不断的跃进，要挖，就要有坚强的革命意志和毅力，有革命的雄心壮志和满腔热情，对于什么事情都不敢想也不敢做的懒汉和懦夫，没有这种开挖思想宝库的精神，自然也就无法从思想的宝库中发掘出无穷的智慧和巨大的力量。因此，对待革命事业有没有不断跃进的精神，有没有尽量发挥主观能动作用的干劲，是人们有没有革命的无产阶级世界观的反映。
    为什么心思是挖不空的呢？因为我们是马克思主义者。我们用马克思列宁主义把自己武装起来，在我们看来，客观事物的发展变化是永不停息，永无止境的；人们对于客观事物的认识也是逐渐提高，逐渐深刻和完整的。随着对事物发展规律认识的不断提高，人们就越来越多地增强自己改造自然、征服自然的能力。因此，人们的心思永远也挖不空，而且越挖越丰富。井里的水之所以取之不尽，用之不竭，除了需要不断地挖掘，最重要的是因为它和四面八方的源泉息息相通，不是静止和停滞的。人类历史的实践证明了生产力的发展是没有终结的，我国社会主义建设事业高速度发展的事实，也证明了这一条真理。特别是大跃进以来，全国人民在总路线的光辉照耀下，破除迷信，解放思想，发扬了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格。毛泽东思想日益深入地掌握了六亿人民，形成了无比巨大的革命干劲，人人挖心思，鼓干劲；而干劲又促进了心思的丰富。人们的干劲一鼓再鼓，生产效率一再提高，于是，我们看到了巨大的创造力量像是长江滚滚，一浪高一浪，一峰接一峰，无穷的波涛以排山倒海之势奔腾澎湃。推动着我国的社会主义建设事业高速度发展。心思的丰富源泉就是把马克思主义创造性地运用到我国实际的毛泽东思想。离开这个源泉，心思就只有枯涸了。
    我们说心思挖不空，是因为一个人的“心思”不是脱离现实而存在的，它和井里的水一样同客观事物和集体的智慧联系在一起。人们只要密切联系群众，联系实际，虚心地学习，那么他的“心思”就更加丰富起来。魏高厚的“心思”是丰富的，因为他不只从党的教育中得到了智慧，从自己的努力产生了智慧，而且从群众中吸取智慧。他参加了一次“群英会”就学到了九十六种先进技术经验，再在最短的时间内全部实现。人的智慧是无穷的，群众的智慧更是无穷的。
    我们把生产潜力看作永不枯竭的水井，看作滔滔不绝的长江，还因为我们认为人的力量是无穷的。在革命者看来，任何幸福、美好都不是自然界自发赐给的，而是人们经过斗争向自然界索取来的。人的主观能动作用对于发展社会生产永远起着决定性的作用。在社会主义制度下，人民群众真正成了社会和自然的主人，这种作用就更加明显。毛泽东同志在“介绍一个合作社”中说道：“除了党的领导之外，六亿人口是一个决定的因素。”因此，只要我们树立雄心壮志，鼓足干劲，力争上游，就能够充分利用有利条件，永远向前走，永远是胜利。
    心思是挖不空的，潜力是用不完的，我们的跃进也是永不停止的，让我们紧紧地掌握住毛泽东思想的武器，努力地去挖开思想的宝库吧！
