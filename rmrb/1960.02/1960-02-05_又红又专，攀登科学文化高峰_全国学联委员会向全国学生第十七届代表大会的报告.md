Comrades!

Implementing the Party's Education Policy, a Great Revolution and Development Situation Has Emerged in School Education

Dear students:

As our 17th National Student Congress convenes, the people of the entire nation, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, are continuing to hold aloft the glorious banners of the General Line for Socialist Construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. On the basis of completing the main tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, the country strides into the first year of the 1960s. We are excited to see the rapid developments of our nation's socialist revolution and construction over the four years since the last congress in August 1955. The socialist revolution on the economic front has been completed, and decisive victories have been achieved on the political and ideological fronts. The successful completion of the First Five-Year Plan has laid a preliminary foundation for our nation's socialist industrialization. Agricultural production has also seen tremendous growth. As the Second Five-Year Plan began, our nation's industrial and agricultural production took a Great Leap Forward and is continuing to do so. Along with the Great Leap Forward in economic construction and the implementation of the Party's policies of "education serving proletarian politics, education combined with productive labor," and "walking on two legs" in developing cultural and educational undertakings, a great revolution and great development has emerged in school education. The number of higher education institutions nationwide has increased from 194 in 1955 to the current 841; the student population has increased from over 280,000 to 810,000. Spare-time higher education has also seen significant growth. In 1955, the proportion of students in higher education with worker and peasant backgrounds was 29%, but in 1959, this proportion had risen to 51%. Over the past four years, higher education institutions have contributed 260,000 graduates to the ranks of talent for national construction, while only 210,000 people graduated in the 36 years before liberation (1912-1947). From 1955 to 1958, the total area of new school buildings in higher education institutions nationwide reached 6.95 million square meters, more than double the total construction area in the 50 years before liberation (1898-1948). The situation of many schools, where they were previously distant from current political struggles and production construction, has changed. The enormous harm of the separation of theory from practice, left to us by bourgeois education, has begun to be fundamentally eliminated. The high-speed leap forward in our country's economic and cultural construction fills every student with joy and excitement for the nation's increasing prosperity and strength!

If we reflect on the progress and growth of students nationwide over the past few years, we can hardly contain our excitement and joy. Our schools have never been so full of surging political enthusiasm, soaring revolutionary vigor, and a strong atmosphere of learning and scientific research. Absolutely obeying the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao, and being good students of Chairman Mao, is the highest aspiration of the vast majority of students. The idea of struggling for socialism and communism has become the driving force in most students' study and life. Many students from worker and peasant backgrounds, who had little or no schooling before liberation, have overcome one difficulty after another with tenacious perseverance under the care and education of the Party, and have studied diligently to reach the level of higher education students in just a few short years, achieving excellent results in their studies. What force drives them to study so hard? They say: We belong to the Party in everything we do, and we study for the Party! We must surpass bourgeois intellectuals and become red experts who master modern science and culture. This is the spirit of college students in the new China! The great goal has enabled many students to break away from the narrow confines of bourgeois individualism and move towards the infinitely broad new world of working-class collectivism. What concerns the vast majority of students is the future of the motherland and the ideal of communism. Studying Marxism-Leninism and the works of Chairman Mao, and continuously improving their thinking, has become a mass conscious demand. The spirit of collectivism has replaced the old-style university students' practice of self-cultivation and indifference to each other.

In the past, in people's impressions, college students were bookworms who did not understand production and were detached from the working people. Now, loving labor and loving the working people has become an important characteristic of college students in the new China. In 1958, students across the country actively participated in the vigorous mass movement of steelmaking and supporting the "Three Autumns," demonstrating students' direct participation in national construction and their determination to integrate with workers and peasants, which also gave them good physical training. Now, labor has been officially included in the school curriculum, and schools have universally established factories and farms. According to statistics from 323 higher education institutions, there are now 738 self-run factories and 233 farms, with a cultivated area of over 140,000 mu. In the two years from 1958 to 1959, more than 386,000 students contributed more than 36.46 million workdays, with a total output value of over 1.38 billion yuan. Students sing enthusiastically about labor: "In the past, we were afraid of labor, but now we love it in our hearts. Not for fame or fortune, but only to become workers and peasants sooner." College students have made friends with workers and peasants, and have begun to share the same breath and destiny with the working people. They are happy for the harvest and anxious for disasters. The workers and peasants praise the students in the most simple and kind language: "College students have changed, they have become one of us."

The combination of education and productive labor has greatly improved the quality of our learning. Students writing books, engaging in cutting-edge science, and creating the latest products were unimaginable in the past, but have now become common occurrences. For example, the 1955 class of literature specialization in the Chinese Department of Peking University, under the care of the Party and with the guidance and help of teachers and all aspects, rewrote a Chinese literary history of more than one million words after five months of effort. Large planetariums, analog electronic computers, cyclotrons, and program-controlled machine tools have also been manufactured by students. Implementing the Party's education policy has enabled students to learn comprehensively, deeply, vividly, and firmly.

Eternally Heeding the Teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao, Firmly Galloping Forward Along the Road of Being Both Red and Expert

Dear students, when we look back on the progress we have made in moral, intellectual, and physical education, we think of our dear Party and Chairman Mao. It is the general line for building socialism formulated by the Party and Chairman Mao that has given us the greatest encouragement, enabling us to recognize our goals, muster revolutionary vigor, strive for excellence, and move forward continuously. It is the instructions of the Party and Chairman Mao on "good health, good study, and good work," and the policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor," that have enabled us to achieve unprecedented harvests in ideology, reading, labor, and physical fitness. It is the Party and Chairman Mao who have taught us to implement putting politics in command and take the road of being both red and expert, to become cultured laborers with socialist consciousness. In short, all our progress and achievements have been made under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. The Party and Chairman Mao have illuminated our hearts. Let us eternally heed the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao, and firmly gallop forward along the road of being "both red and expert"!

Over the past four years, the All-China Students' Federation, various city student federations, and school student unions, under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the Communist Youth League organizations, have actively organized students to participate in various political movements and political studies, promoted students to study diligently, actively engage in labor, and organized students' cultural and sports activities, achieving certain results. We have paid attention to carrying out revolutionary tradition education among students nationwide. On the 20th anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement, the 40th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement, and other revolutionary festivals, we have widely organized various educational activities. In order to help returned overseas Chinese students understand the motherland's construction and raise their patriotic and socialist ideological awareness, we have organized various study and visiting activities for them. We have also held many student sports meets and art festivals with relevant units. These activities have played a positive role among the students. In February 1957, the All-China Students' Federation convened the Second Plenary Session of the 16th Committee. At this meeting, Chairman Mao and leading comrades of the Party Central Committee received the representatives attending the meeting and cordially taught the students nationwide to continuously improve their communist ideological awareness and develop the spirit of hard work and overcoming difficulties, which greatly educated and encouraged students nationwide.

The All-China Students' Federation, representing the will of Chinese students, has always regarded the struggle against imperialism, against colonialism, and for the defense of world peace, and strengthening friendly cooperation with students of all countries, as its regular and important tasks. We have resolutely supported the just struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America for national independence. During this period, our friendly contacts with students from various countries have seen significant development. Seven hundred and six student representatives from eighty-three countries visited our country. We organized 61 delegations with a total of 857 representatives to visit 24 countries for friendly visits and to participate in international conferences. Entrusted by the International Union of Students, we assisted the Asia-Africa Student Sanatorium in receiving 491 patients from Asian and African countries for recuperation, making a useful contribution to strengthening the friendship between students from various countries and promoting student welfare. In September 1958, the Fifth Congress of the International Union of Students was held in Beijing. At this meeting, Chinese students fully expressed their determination to fully support the struggle against imperialism and colonialism and for lasting world peace. In the future, we will continue to support the International Union of Students in firmly opposing imperialism and colonialism, striving for lasting world peace, and carrying out our just struggle to the end.

Higher Education Students Must Have Lofty Aspirations and Determination in Mastering Science and Culture, and Take on the Glorious and Important Responsibility of Attacking Cutting-Edge and Scaling Peaks

Dear students, the achievements our great motherland has made in the past are extremely brilliant. And an even more glorious and splendid prospect is being presented before us. Now, the Party and Chairman Mao have pointed out new and magnificent goals for the people of the whole country: in the new decade, we must catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in the output of major industrial products, basically establish a complete industrial system, basically realize the modernization of industry, agriculture, and science and culture, and thereby build our country into a strong socialist country. The Chinese people, educated by Mao Zedong Thought and awakened, have found three magic weapons for building socialism: the General Line, the speed of the Great Leap Forward, and the organizational form of the People's Commune. The people of the whole country are not only full of determination and confidence for a better leap forward in 1960, but also full of determination and confidence for the continuous leap forward throughout the 1960s. The people of the whole country not only have infinite hope for building our country into a strong socialist country as soon as possible, but also have infinite hope for realizing communism in our country in the future.

In order to meet the needs of the new situation and rapidly cultivate a strong working-class scientific and technological force and a Marxist-Leninist theoretical force, is a major task for the people of the whole country at present. Just as Chairman Mao pointed out: "With the arrival of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably appear." Therefore, the rapid development of industry and agriculture in our country will inevitably promote the rapid development of science and culture, and the rapid development of science and culture will in turn become a powerful factor in promoting the modernization of industry and agriculture. The high development of science and culture is a necessary condition for accelerating our country's socialist construction and realizing communism in the future. Only by mastering the most advanced science and technology can we have strong economic power and a solid national defense to protect the security of the motherland and world peace. Our country's economic and cultural state of "poverty and blankness" has not been completely changed, and "poverty" and "blankness" are interconnected. It is impossible to completely remove the hat of "poverty" without removing the hat of "blankness"; it is impossible to remove the hat of "blankness" without removing the hat of "poverty." With the rapid development of economic construction, our country has established a vast and strong scientific and cultural force. However, our country is a large country with 650 million people and 9.6 million square kilometers of land, and building socialism and communism is an unprecedentedly arduous and complex undertaking. The current force is obviously not enough to meet the needs of the development of the situation. According to preliminary calculations from relevant parties, in seven to ten years, it will require one million senior and middle-level agricultural scientific and technical personnel to achieve agricultural technological transformation alone, and the scientific and technical talents required by industry and other departments will be even more numerous. From this, it can be seen that in order to adapt to the continued leap forward of our country's socialist construction and the needs of transitioning to communism, our country's working-class scientific and cultural force should be a mighty army. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of our country are, with the momentum and scale of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural construction, launching a vigorous mass technical revolution and cultural revolution upsurge. We college students should have lofty aspirations and determination in the problem of learning and mastering science and culture, and take on the glorious and important responsibility of attacking cutting-edge and scaling peaks, making arduous efforts in all aspects, and cultivating ourselves into working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert.

Thoroughly Transform the Bourgeois Individualistic Worldview, Establish a Communist Worldview, and Achieve Being Both Red and Expert, Profound in Expertise with a Red Heart

First, we must establish a communist worldview. Whether scaling the peaks of science and culture is for the cause of socialism and communism, or for pursuing personal fame and gain, this is a fundamental dividing line between working-class intellectuals and bourgeois intellectuals. Working-class intellectuals are determined to dedicate everything they have, without reservation, to the people and to the great cause of socialist communism. They understand that scientific and cultural undertakings are the cause of hundreds of millions of people under the leadership of the Party, and that learning and mastering science and culture is to serve the construction of socialist communism. Therefore, they can generate the most tenacious perseverance and determination, unswervingly move forward, and do great things that no one has ever done before. Working-class intellectuals arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, master dialectical materialism and historical materialism, and therefore can correctly understand the objective laws of the development of things, uncover the mysteries of science, and push the cause of science to a glorious peak. In contrast, the worldview of bourgeois intellectuals is individualistic and idealistic, so they proceed from their personal interests in everything. The entire purpose of their lives is for themselves, and they regard science and technology as the monopoly of a few people. Learning and mastering science and culture is only to pursue personal fame and status. We revolutionary youth must never take the bourgeois road.

After years of education by the Party, the vast majority of students have discerned the direction and are determined to take the broad road of working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert, which is the basic and main aspect. However, because many students still come from families of the exploiting classes, the petty bourgeoisie, and the wealthy middle peasants, bourgeois ideology still has a considerable influence in society and schools, and this influence will continue to exist for a considerable period of time. Thoroughly transforming the bourgeois individualistic worldview is still an arduous task for us. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological field, the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, in institutions of higher learning is often manifested as the struggle between the "red and expert road" and the "white and expert road." The "white and expert road" still has a market in schools. For example, a very small number of students are resistant and dissatisfied with the Party's education policy. They do not care about politics, and they are unwilling to participate in productive labor. They believe that being red is unimportant, as long as they are "expert," they will have "strength" and be "a rare commodity," and they can bargain with the people. They take knowledge as their private property and take mastering science and culture as a means to pursue personal fame and gain. We must continue to wage a resolute struggle against these manifestations of the bourgeois individualistic worldview. Chairman Mao taught us: "Although the vast number of intellectuals have made progress, they should not be complacent about it. In order to fully adapt to the needs of the new society, and in order to unite with the workers and peasants, intellectuals must continue to transform themselves, gradually abandon the bourgeois worldview, and establish the proletarian and communist worldview. The transformation of the worldview is a fundamental transformation, and most intellectuals cannot be said to have completed this transformation. We hope that our country's intellectuals will continue to advance, gradually establish a communist worldview in their work and study, gradually learn Marxism-Leninism well, and gradually integrate with the workers and peasants, and do not stop halfway, let alone retreat backwards, there is no way out for retreat." Chairman Mao's instructions on this issue are so detailed and thorough, and they are completely suitable for the situation of the vast majority of our students. As long as we make efforts in this direction in a down-to-earth manner, we will definitely be able to achieve being both red and expert, profound in expertise with a red heart, and make contributions to the development of the motherland's scientific and cultural undertakings.

Hold High the Glorious Banner of Combining Education with Productive Labor, Persist in Participating in Productive Labor, and Combine Mental Labor with Physical Labor

Second, we must persist in participating in productive labor and combine mental labor with physical labor. The attitude towards labor, mainly physical labor, is another fundamental point of divergence between working-class intellectuals and bourgeois intellectuals. The working class has always believed that labor creates the world, that productive labor is the fundamental source of all theoretical knowledge, and that it is the soil in which science and culture grow. Therefore, we advocate combining education and scientific research with productive labor, and combining mental labor with physical labor. The separation and opposition of mental labor and physical labor are inseparable from the division of human society into classes. With the victory of the socialist revolution, this state of opposition has been basically eliminated. However, there will be a long process to eliminate the differences between mental labor and physical labor. The combination of education and productive labor plays a significant role in promoting the elimination of the differences between mental labor and physical labor and is indispensable. The Party's proposal of "intellectualizing workers and peasants and laborizing intellectuals" is the only correct way to gradually combine mental labor and physical labor. The bourgeoisie and its intellectuals believe that the separation and opposition of mental labor and physical labor is a reasonable "division of labor" in society and should be maintained forever. Therefore, they oppose the policy of combining education and scientific research with productive labor, and spread the absurd notion that intellectuals' participation in labor is a "loss outweighs the gain." On this issue, more than 800,000 college students and more than 10 million secondary school students can give the best answers with their own experiences and insights. After participating in productive labor, the students have not only tempered the working-class stand, thinking, and feelings, but also improved the quality of learning. They have not only learned some practical production skills, but also better understood the basic knowledge, promoting the vigorous development of scientific research. In this way, we have achieved comprehensive development in moral, intellectual, and physical education, and we can also prepare the necessary conditions for realizing communism in the future. Therefore, the conclusion is that combining education with productive labor is a "very good" thing. We must persist in labor training, hold higher the glorious banner of combining education with productive labor, and continue to advance on the road of "intellectualizing workers and peasants and laborizing intellectuals."

Study Diligently and Actively Participate in Scientific Research. Both Study with an Open Mind and Have the Spirit of Originality

Third, we must study diligently and actively participate in scientific research. To scale the peaks of science, we must work hard and study diligently. We must learn well the various courses prescribed by the school, and we must lay a solid foundation in terms of knowledge. "A tall building rises from the ground," without a deep foundation, there is no talk of having profound attainments and outstanding achievements in science. Therefore, we must not have any neglect of the study of basic theoretical knowledge. In order to rapidly improve our country's scientific and cultural level, and in order to cultivate and strengthen our country's scientific and cultural force faster and better, our college students, while studying basic theoretical courses diligently, must also, under the leadership of the Party, combine teachers and students, actively participate in scientific research, and widely carry out various scientific and technological activities. Scientific research should be closely linked to the practice of production construction and social struggle, and should be carried out in conjunction with teaching and productive labor. As everyone knows, scientific research in institutions of higher learning is an important part of our country's entire scientific research work, and the vast number of students are an indispensable force in scientific research in institutions of higher learning. Our Party's policy for developing science and culture is to follow the mass line, which is the line of combining experts and the masses under the leadership of the Party. Therefore, the Party has always attached importance to mobilizing the vast number of students to participate in scientific research. Since 1958, college students have been engaged in scientific research on a large scale, and there have been many vivid facts of major inventions and creations, which proves that: Combining teachers and students to conduct scientific research can make a certain contribution to our country's scientific cause. Participating in scientific research can enable students to consolidate and develop the scientific knowledge they have learned, receive preliminary training in scientific research methods, cultivate the ability to think independently and work independently, thereby better improving the quality of learning. The view that college students cannot engage in scientific research, or the view that scientific research and learning are opposed to each other, are both incorrect.

Whether reading or conducting scientific research, we must combine studying with an open mind and the spirit of originality. We are students now, and we must study with an open mind from teachers and all knowledgeable people, and accept the cultural heritage of our predecessors and all true scientific achievements of ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign. However, we should see that the entire history of scientific and technological development is written with countless creations and inventions. If the scientists of the past could only follow in the footsteps of their predecessors and dared not break through the old frameworks, then the development of science and technology might have stopped long ago. Therefore, we must continue to break superstitions, liberate our minds, and develop the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act. Creation and invention are always accompanied by the struggle against old things and old traditions. True scientists dare to abandon and break all kinds of outdated theories and create new theories. The history of scientific development is full of such brave figures. Of course, all scientists in the past are inevitably limited by their times and classes. Compared with the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act that is being developed by our hundreds of millions of people under the leadership of the Party today, it is truly incomparable. Today, we have the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism. As long as we dare to think, speak, and act on the basis of diligent study, we will definitely be able to surpass the ancients and push our country's working-class scientific cause to the highest peak in the world.

To scale the peaks of science, we must also combine personal hard work and collective cooperation well. Personal hard work should be emphasized at all times. On the journey of scaling the peaks of science, we must abandon any fluke or opportunistic ideas and work in a down-to-earth manner. However, the personal hard work we are talking about has nothing in common with the old-fashioned intellectuals' closed-door approach to work and self-admiration that is detached from the collective. Scientific research itself is a collective undertaking. Moreover, with the development of science and technology, the division of labor is becoming more and more detailed, and the coordination and cooperation between each other is becoming more and more important. Many scientific research projects are large in scale, have many contents, and are highly comprehensive, requiring the cooperation of many people. Therefore, we must greatly develop the spirit of collectivism and the spirit of communist large-scale cooperation, and combine personal hard work with collective cooperation, so that we can make greater achievements in scientific research.

Arm Yourself with Mao Zedong Thought, Take Studying Mao Zedong Thought as a Major Political Task

Dear students, our beloved leader Chairman Mao is our most sublime, greatest, and most glorious role model. Chairman Mao is the outstanding representative of our country's heroic proletariat and the outstanding representative of the excellent traditions of our great nation. He is a talented and creative Marxist-Leninist. He creatively combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, pointing out the only correct path for the complete liberation of our country's people—the Mao Zedong Road, thereby comprehensively developing Marxism-Leninism on a series of issues. History has repeatedly proven, and will continue to prove, that Mao Zedong Thought is the truth of Marxism-Leninism and is the lighthouse for the victorious advance of our country's people and youth. Everything will be victorious if we act according to Mao Zedong Thought; everything will fail if we violate Mao Zedong Thought. Studying Mao Zedong Thought is the most fundamental issue related to cultivating youth into successors to the communist cause. It will play a great and decisive role in improving students' political and ideological awareness, establishing a proletarian worldview, and promoting the healthy development of students' entire lives. Therefore, our students should take studying Mao Zedong Thought as their major political task, and be determined to arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and launch a heat wave of diligently studying the works of Mao Zedong. We believe that as long as students set lofty aspirations and study diligently, they will definitely be able to cultivate themselves into good students of Mao Zedong and make greater contributions to the socialist and communist cause.

Maintain High Vigilance, Unite with the Peace-Loving People of the World, and Thoroughly Expose and Smash the U.S.'s Conspiracy of Fake Peace and Real War Preparation

Chinese students are not only concerned about the fate of their own country and people, but also very concerned about the fate of the people of the world. At present, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is unprecedentedly strong, the cause of socialist and communist construction is thriving, the mass movement with the communist parties of various countries as its core is flourishing, the national independence movement in Asia, Africa, and Latin America is rising day by day, and the struggle for lasting world peace is becoming more widespread and deep-rooted. The capitalist world is increasingly mired in stagnation, turbulence, and disintegration, especially the economic situation of U.S. imperialism is deteriorating, and its war policy and policy of aggression are also encountering increasing resistance. These signs indicate that socialist forces have surpassed imperialist forces, and peaceful forces have surpassed war forces. This fully confirms Chairman Mao's brilliant thesis that "the East wind prevails over the West wind." Faced with this situation, U.S. imperialism is forced to consider changing certain aspects of its foreign policy, and is putting up the signboard of so-called "commitment to the cause of peace." However, we should see that while the United States is talking about peace, it is clinging to its so-called "deterrence" and "policy of strength." Recently, it colluded with the reactionary forces of Japan and signed the Japan-U.S. "Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security," which is hostile to China and the Soviet Union, threatens Asian countries, and exacerbates the tense situation in the Far East. All this tells us that U.S. imperialism's tactics may have some changes, but its aggressive nature and war policy will not change; imperialism will use two weapons: real guns and sugar-coated bullets; imperialism has two faces: one is the undisguised ferocious true face, and the other is the disguised benevolent mask. But its purpose is only one: to preserve imperialism and eliminate socialism; to preserve reactionary forces and eliminate progressive forces; to preserve the "free world" of aggressors and oppressors and eliminate the people's true freedom. Faced with such a situation, we Chinese students are full of confidence in the bright future of our country and the communist cause in the world. On the one hand, we must study hard and actively participate in our country's socialist construction; on the other hand, we must maintain high vigilance, unite with the peace-loving people of the world, thoroughly expose and smash the U.S.'s various conspiracies of fake peace and real war preparation, thwart the war forces headed by U.S. imperialism, and ensure that lasting world peace and the cause of human progress are truly and reliably guaranteed.

Dear students, our 650 million people are, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, full of vigor and high morale, and are entering a new and great historical period. The motherland is becoming increasingly prosperous and strong, and before us are infinitely beautiful realities and a bright and brilliant future. All this constantly inspires and encourages us. We young people are like the sun at eight or nine o'clock in the morning, strong and energetic. Everyone should have lofty aspirations, and everyone should be full of vigor, so that they can learn the best, progress the fastest, and contribute the most. Let us, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, hold higher the banner of being both red and expert, and strive valiantly to build our beloved motherland into a socialist power with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture as soon as possible.

    又红又专，攀登科学文化高峰
    ——全国学联委员会向全国学生第十七届代表大会的报告
    胡启立
    贯彻执行党的教育方针，学校教育事业出现大革命和大发展的局面亲爱的同学们：
    当我们全国学生第十七届代表大会召开的时候，全国人民正在党中央和毛主席领导下，在提前三年完成第二个五年计划各项主要指标的基础上，继续高举社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社的光辉旗帜，大踏步地跨入了六十年代的第一年。我们十分兴奋地看到，在1955年8月上届代表大会召开以来的四年多当中，我国的社会主义革命和建设事业，又有了多么飞速的发展。经济战线上的社会主义革命已经完成，政治战线、思想战线上的社会主义革命也取得了决定性的胜利。第一个国民经济五年计划的胜利完成，已经为我国的社会主义工业化奠定了初步的基础。农业生产也有了极大的增长。第二个国民经济五年计划一开始，我国的工农业生产就迈开了大跃进的步伐，并且正在继续跃进当中。随着经济建设的大跃进，随着党的“教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”和发展文化教育事业“两条腿走路”的方针的贯彻执行，学校教育事业也出现了一个大革命和大发展的局面。全国高等学校已由1955年的一百九十四所增加到现在的八百四十一所；学生人数已由二十八万多人增加到八十一万人；业余的高等学校也有了很大的发展。在1955年，高等学校学生中工农成份的比例是29％，而1959年，这个比例已经上升到51％；四年来，高等学校又输送了二十六万毕业生加入到祖国建设人材的队伍，而解放前三十六年（1912年—1947年）中才只有二十一万人毕业。1955年至1958年四年中，全国高等学校新建校舍面积达六百九十五万平方米，比解放前五十年（1898年—1948年）建筑面积总和还多一倍多。不少学校过去那种和当前政治斗争、生产建设距离得很远的状况，已经改变了，资产阶级教育给我们遗留下来的理论与实际脱节的巨大祸害已经开始从根本上消除。我们国家的经济建设和文化建设这样高速度的跃进，使每一个同学都为祖国的日益繁荣富强而感到欢欣鼓舞！
    如果回顾一下这几年来全国同学的进步和成长，我们就更加抑制不住内心的激动和喜悦。在我们的学校里，从来没有像今天这样充满着高涨的政治热情，冲天的革命干劲，浓厚的学习和科学研究风气。绝对听从党和毛主席的教导，做毛主席的好学生，是广大同学的最高意愿。为社会主义、共产主义事业奋斗的思想，已经成为大多数同学学习和生活的动力。许多工农出身的同学，解放前没有念过书或念书不多，但是在党的关怀和教育下，他们以顽强的毅力克服了一个又一个的困难，刻苦地学习，在短短的几年内达到高等学校学生的水平，并且在学习中获得了优良成绩。究竟是什么力量推动他们这样顽强学习的呢？他们说：我们一切属于党，我们学习为了党！我们一定要超过资产阶级知识分子，成为掌握现代科学文化的红色专家。这就是新中国大学生的气魄！伟大的目标，使许多同学摆脱了资产阶级个人主义的狭小圈子，走向工人阶级集体主义无限广阔的新天地。广大同学所关心的是祖国的前途，共产主义的理想；学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛主席著作，不断提高思想，已经成为群众性的自觉要求。集体主义的精神，代替了旧式学校大学生独善其身、不相闻问的作风。
    过去，在人们的印象里，大学生是不懂生产和脱离劳动人民的书呆子，而现在，热爱劳动和热爱劳动人民已经成为新中国大学生的重要特征。1958年，全国同学积极参加了轰轰烈烈的大炼钢铁和支援“三秋”的群众运动，表现了学生直接参加国家建设事业，表现了他们和工农群众结合的决心，并使他们受到了一次很好的劳动锻炼。现在，劳动已经正式列为学校的课程，学校里普遍办起了工厂、农场。据三百二十三所高等学校的统计，现已自办工厂七百三十八个；农场二百三十三个，耕地面积十四万多亩；在1958年到1959年的两年中，三十八万六千多学生共作了三千六百四十六万多个劳动日；生产总值达到十三亿八千多万元。同学们这样热情地歌颂劳动：“过去看见劳动怕，如今心里爱上它，不为名来不为利，只为早日工农化”。大学生和工农交上了朋友，开始和劳动人民同呼吸，共命运，他们为丰收而高兴，为灾害而焦急。工农群众以最朴素、亲切的语言赞扬同学说：“大学生变了，成了自己人了”。
    教育和生产劳动结合，使我们的学习质量大大提高了。学生编书，搞尖端科学和创制最新产品等，这在过去是不可想像的，但在今天已经成为普通的现象了。例如，北京大学中文系文学专门化1955级同学，在党的关怀下，在教师和各方面的指导帮助下，经过五个月的努力，重新编写成一百多万字的中国文学史。大型天象仪、模拟电子计算机、回旋加速器、程序控制机床等产品，也从学生手里制造出来了。贯彻党的教育方针，使同学们学得全了，学得深了，学得活了，学得牢了。
    永远听从党和毛主席的教导，坚定地沿着又红又专的道路飞奔前进
    亲爱的同学们，当我们回顾自己在德育、智育、体育各方面获得进步的时候，我们就想起了亲爱的党和毛主席。是党和毛主席制定的建设社会主义的总路线，给了我们最大的鼓舞，使我们认清了奋斗目标，鼓足革命干劲，力争上游，不断地前进。是党和毛主席的“身体好、学习好、工作好”的指示，和“教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针，使我们在思想、读书、劳动和体质各方面获得了前所未有的丰收。是党和毛主席教导我们，要实行政治挂帅，走又红又专的道路，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。总之，我们的一切进步和成绩，都是在党和毛主席的领导下取得的。党和毛主席照亮了我们的心。让我们永远听从党和毛主席的教导，坚定地沿着“又红又专”的道路飞奔前进！
    在这四年多中间，全国学联、各个市学联和学校学生会，在党的领导和共青团组织的帮助下，在号召广大同学积极参加各项政治运动和政治学习，推动同学认真读书，积极劳动，组织同学的文化、体育活动等方面，进行了不少的工作，取得了一定的成绩。我们注意了对全国同学进行革命传统教育。在“一二·九”二十周年、“五四”运动四十周年和其它革命节日，广泛地组织了各种具有教育意义的活动。为了帮助归国华侨同学了解祖国建设情况，提高爱国主义、社会主义思想觉悟，为他们组织了各种学习和参观活动。我们还同有关单位举办了许多次学生运动会和文艺会演等。上述这些活动都在广大同学中起了良好的作用。1957年2月，全国学联召开了第十六届委员会第二次全体会议。在这次会议上，毛主席和党中央领导同志接见了出席会议的代表，亲切地教导全国同学要不断地提高共产主义思想觉悟，发扬艰苦奋斗，战胜困难的精神，使全国同学受到了极大的教育和鼓舞。
    全国学联代表中国学生的意志，一向把反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义、保卫世界和平的斗争，加强与各国学生的友好合作，作为自己经常的重大任务。我们坚决地支援了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民争取民族独立的正义斗争。这段时间里，我们和各国学生的友好联系有了显著的发展，八十三个国家的七百零六位学生代表，到我国进行了访问。我们组织了六十一个代表团共八百五十七名代表到二十四个国家进行友好访问和参加国际会议。我们受国际学联的委托，协助亚非学生疗养院接待了来自亚、非各国的四百九十一名病员疗养，对加强各国学生的友谊和增进学生的福利作出了有益的贡献。1958年9月，在北京举行了国际学生联合会第五届代表大会，在这次会议上，中国学生充分地表达了全力支持反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取世界持久和平斗争的决心。今后，我们仍将继续支持国际学联坚决反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取世界持久和平，把我们的正义斗争进行到底。
    高等学校同学在掌握科学文化上，要立大志，下决心，把攻尖端、攀高峰的光荣重大责任担当起来
    亲爱的同学们，我们伟大的祖国在过去所取得的成就，是极其辉煌的。而更加光辉灿烂的前景，正展示在我们的面前。现在，党和毛主席给全国人民指出了新的宏伟的奋斗目标：在新的十年间，要在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国，基本上建立起完整的工业体系，基本上实现工业、农业和科学文化的现代化，从而把我国建成为一个强大的社会主义国家。被毛泽东思想教育了的、已经觉醒了的我国人民，找到了建设社会主义的总路线，大跃进的发展速度，和人民公社的组织形式这三个法宝。全国人民不但对于1960年的更好的跃进充满了决心和信心，而且对于整个六十年代的连续跃进也充满了决心和信心。全国人民不但对于把我国尽快地建成强大的社会主义国家怀着无限的希望，而且对于将来在我国实现共产主义也怀着无限的希望。
    为了适应新形势的需要，迅速地培养出一支工人阶级的强大的科学技术队伍和马克思列宁主义的理论队伍，是当前全国人民的一个重大任务。正如毛主席所指示的那样：“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。”因此，我国工农业的高速发展，必然要推动科学文化的高速发展，而科学文化的高速发展，又会反过来成为促进工业和农业现代化的强有力的因素。科学文化的高度发展，是加速我国社会主义建设和将来实现共产主义的必要条件。只有掌握了最先进的科学技术，才能有强大的经济力量，才能有巩固的国防，保卫祖国的安全和世界和平。我国的经济文化的“一穷二白”的状态还未彻底改变，而“穷”与“白”又是互相联系着的，不摘掉“穷”的帽子，是不可能彻底摘掉“白”的帽子；不摘掉“白”的帽子，也不可能摘掉“穷”的帽子。随着经济建设的飞跃发展，我国已经建立了一支广大强壮的科学文化队伍。但是，我国是一个拥有六亿五千万人民和九百六十万平方公里土地的大国，建设社会主义和共产主义又是空前艰巨复杂的事业，目前这支队伍显然还不能满足形势发展的需要。据有关方面初步计算，在七年到十年的时间，单是实现农业技术改造，就需要一百万高级和中级的农业科学技术人员，工业和其他部门所需要的科学技术人才不用说更多了。由此可见，为着适应我国的社会主义建设的继续跃进，和过渡到共产主义的需要，我国工人阶级的科学文化队伍应当是一支浩浩荡荡的大军。我国人民正在党和毛主席的领导下，以工农业建设大跃进的气势和规模，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的群众性的技术革命和文化革命高潮，我们高等学校的同学，在学习和掌握科学文化的问题上，应该立大志，下决心，把攻尖端、攀高峰这个光荣重大的责任担当起来，从各方面去作艰苦的努力，把自己培养成为又红又专的工人阶级的知识分子。
    彻底改造资产阶级个人主义的世界观，树立共产主义的世界观，做到又红又专，红透专深
    第一，必须树立共产主义的世界观。攀登科学文化高峰，是为了社会主义、共产主义事业，还是为了猎取个人名利，这是工人阶级知识分子和资产阶级知识分子的一条根本的分界线。工人阶级知识分子，决心把自己的一切，毫无保留地贡献给人民，贡献给社会主义共产主义的伟大事业。他们懂得，科学文化事业是党所领导下的亿万人民的事业，学习和掌握科学文化是为建设社会主义共产主义服务，因而能够产生出最顽强的毅力和决心，百折不回，勇往直前，做出前人从未做过的伟大事业。工人阶级知识分子用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，掌握辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义，因而能够正确认识事物的客观发展规律，揭开科学的奥秘，把科学事业推向光辉的顶点。与此相反，资产阶级知识分子的世界观，是个人主义、唯心主义的，所以他们一切从个人的利益出发，生活的全部目的就是为了自己，把科学技术看作是少数人的垄断品，学习和掌握科学文化只不过是为了追求个人的名誉地位。我们革命青年绝不能走资产阶级的道路。
    经过党的多年教育，绝大多数的同学辨清了方向，决心要走又红又专的工人阶级知识分子的康庄大道，这是基本的主要的一方面。但是，由于目前很多的同学还是出身于剥削阶级、小资产阶级和富裕中农的家庭，在社会上和学校里，资产阶级的思想还有相当大的影响，并且这种影响还会在相当长时期内存在。彻底改造资产阶级个人主义的世界观，对于我们还是一项艰巨的任务。意识形态领域中的无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，社会主义和资本主义的两条道路斗争，在高等学校中往往表现为“红专道路”和“白专道路”的斗争。“白专道路”在学校中还是有市场的。比如，有极少数同学对党的教育方针抵触不满，他们不关心政治，不愿参加生产劳动，他们认为，红不红无关重要，只要“专”了，就有了“实力”，就“奇货可居”，可以向人民讨价还价；他们把知识占为私有，把掌握科学文化作为追逐个人名利的手段。对这些资产阶级个人主义世界观的表现，必须继续进行坚决的斗争。毛主席教导我们说：“广大的知识分子虽然已经有了进步，但是不应当因此自满，为了充分适应新社会的需要，为了同工人农民团结一致，知识分子必须继续改造自己，逐步地抛弃资产阶级的世界观而树立无产阶级的、共产主义的世界观。世界观的转变是一个根本的转变，现在多数知识分子还不能说已经完成了这个转变。我们希望我国的知识分子继续前进，在自己的工作和学习的过程中，逐步地树立共产主义的世界观，逐步地学好马克思列宁主义，逐步地同工人农民打成一片，而不要中途停顿，更不要向后倒退，倒退是没有出路的。”毛主席对这个问题的指示是这样的详尽和透彻，也完全适合我们广大同学的情况。只要我们切切实实地向着这个方向去努力，我们就一定能够做到又红又专、红透专深，在发展祖国的科学文化事业上做出贡献。
    高举教育与生产劳动相结合的光荣旗帜，坚持参加生产劳动，把脑力劳动和体力劳动结合起来
    第二，必须坚持参加生产劳动，把脑力劳动和体力劳动结合起来。对待劳动主要是体力劳动的态度如何，是工人阶级知识分子和资产阶级知识分子的又一个根本分歧点。工人阶级从来就认为劳动创造世界，生产劳动是产生一切理论知识的根本源泉，是科学文化生长的土壤，所以我们主张教育、科学研究要和生产劳动相结合，脑力劳动要和体力劳动相结合。脑力劳动和体力劳动的分离和对立，是同人类社会划分为阶级分不开的。随着社会主义革命的胜利，这种对立的状况就基本上消灭了。但是，要消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的差别，还要有一个较长的过程。教育和生产劳动相结合，对于消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动之间的差别，起很大的促进作用，是必不可少的。党所提出的：“工农群众知识化，知识分子劳动化”，就是使脑力劳动和体力劳动逐步结合的唯一正确的途径。资产阶级和它的知识分子，则认为脑力劳动与体力劳动的分离和对立，是社会的合理的“分工”，应当永远保持下去，所以他们反对教育、科学研究与生产劳动结合的方针，散布知识分子参加劳动是“得不偿失”的滥调。对于这个问题，八十多万高等学校的同学和一千多万的中等学校同学，都能以自己切身的经历和体会给以最好的回答。同学们参加了生产劳动以后，不但锻炼了工人阶级的立场、思想和感情，而且提高了学习质量；不但学到了一些实际的生产技能，而且更好地领会了基础知识，推动了科学研究的蓬勃开展。这样，就使我们获得了德育、智育、体育的全面发展，而且可以为将来实现共产主义准备必要的条件。因此，结论是教育与生产劳动相结合，是“好得很”的事情。我们一定要坚持劳动锻炼，更高地举起教育与生产劳动结合的光荣旗帜，在“工农群众知识化，知识分子劳动化”的道路上继续前进。
    认真读书，积极参加科学研究。既要虚心学习，又要有独创精神
    第三，必须认真读书，积极参加科学研究。要攀登科学高峰，必须认真劳动，又认真读书。我们要学好学校所规定的各门课程，要在知识方面打下扎扎实实的基础。“万丈高楼平地起”，没有深厚的基础，就谈不到在科学上有什么高深的造诣和出色的成就。因此，我们对于基础理论知识的学习，决不能有任何忽视。为了迅速地提高我国的科学文化水平，为了更快更好地培养和壮大我国科学文化队伍，我们高等学校的同学，在认真学好基础理论课程的同时，还必须在党的领导下，师生结合，积极参加科学研究，广泛开展各种科学技术活动。科学研究应当密切联系生产建设和社会斗争的实践，结合教学和生产劳动来进行。大家知道，高等学校的科学研究是我国整个科学研究工作中的一个重要组成部分，而广大同学又是高等学校科学研究中的一支不可缺少的力量。我们党发展科学文化的方针，是走群众路线，是党领导下的专家与群众相结合的路线，因此党一向重视发动广大同学参加科学研究。1958年以来，高等学校同学大搞科学研究，并且出现了不少重大发明创造的生动事实，这也就证明了：师生结合，进行科学研究，能够对我国的科学事业作出一定的贡献。参加科学研究，可以使同学们巩固和发展所学的科学知识，受到科学研究方法的初步训练，培养独立思考和独立工作的能力，从而也就更好地提高了学习质量。认为大学生不能搞科学研究，或者把科学研究和学习对立起来的看法，都是不对的。
    无论读书，还是进行科学研究，都必须把虚心学习和独创精神结合起来。我们现在是学生，我们要虚心地向教师和一切有知识的人学习，接受前人的文化遗产和古今中外一切真正的科学成果。但是，我们应当看到，整个科学技术发展的历史，是用无数的创造发明写成的。如果过去的科学家们都只能踩着前人的脚印走路，不敢突破旧的框框，那末，科学技术的发展也许早已停顿了。因此，我们必须继续破除迷信，解放思想，发扬敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格。创造和发明总要伴随着对旧事物旧传统的斗争。真正的科学家，敢于抛弃和打破各种陈腐的学说，创立新的理论。科学发展史上就充满了这样的勇敢人物。当然，一切过去历史上的科学家都难免有他们时代和阶级的局限性，和我们今天亿万人民在党领导下所发扬的敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格相比，那真是不可同日而语了。今天我们有党和毛主席的领导，有马克思列宁主义思想的指导，只要我们在认真学习的基础上敢想敢说敢干，我们一定能够超过古人，把我国工人阶级的科学事业推向世界的最高峰。
    要攀登科学高峰，还必须把个人的刻苦钻研和集体的协作很好地结合起来。个人的刻苦钻研是任何时候都要强调的。在攀登科学高峰的征途上，我们必须抛弃任何侥幸、取巧的念头，踏踏实实地干。但是，我们所说的个人刻苦钻研，跟旧式知识分子那种脱离集体的闭门造车和孤芳自赏毫无共同之处。科学研究本身就是一种集体的事业。而且，随着科学技术的发展，分工愈细，彼此间的配合、协作愈是显得重要。有许多科学研究项目，规模大，内容多，综合性强，需要许多人共同合作。所以，我们一定要大大发扬集体主义精神和共产主义大协作的精神，把个人钻研和集体协作结合起来，这样才能在科学研究上作出更大的成绩。
    用毛泽东思想武装自己，把学习毛泽东思想作为重大的政治任务
    亲爱的同学们，我们敬爱的领袖毛主席是我们最崇高、最伟大、最光辉的学习榜样。毛主席是我国英勇无产阶级的杰出代表，是我们伟大民族的优秀传统的杰出代表。他是天才的创造性的马克思列宁主义者。他创造性地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践结合起来，为我国人民的彻底解放指出了唯一正确的道路——毛泽东道路，从而在一系列的问题上全面地发展了马克思列宁主义。历史已经反复证明，还将继续证明，毛泽东思想就是马克思列宁主义的真理，就是我国人民和青年胜利前进的灯塔。凡是按照毛泽东思想去做，就一定无往而不胜；凡是违背了毛泽东思想的，就一定失败。学习毛泽东思想，是关系到培养青年成为共产主义事业接班人的最根本的问题，它对于提高同学的政治思想觉悟，树立无产阶级的世界观，对于同学一生的健全发展都将起着伟大的决定性的作用。因此，我们同学应当把学习毛泽东思想作为自己的重大的政治任务，下决心以毛泽东思想武装自己，掀起一个认真学习毛泽东著作的热潮。我们相信，同学们只要立下大志，刻苦学习，就一定能够培养自己成为毛泽东的好学生，在社会主义和共产主义事业里做出更大的贡献。
    保持高度警惕，同全世界爱好和平的人民团结起来，彻底揭露和粉碎美国的假和平真备战的阴谋
    中国学生不仅关心自己国家和人民的命运，而且也十分关心世界人民的命运。目前，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营空前强大，社会主义、共产主义建设事业欣欣向荣，以各国共产党为核心的群众运动蓬勃发展，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族独立运动日益高涨，争取世界持久和平的斗争更加广泛和深入。而资本主义世界正日益陷于停滞、动荡和分崩离析的境地，特别是美帝国主义的经济情况日益恶化，它的战争政策和侵略政策也遇到越来越大的反抗，这些标志着社会主义力量超过了帝国主义的力量，和平力量超过了战争的力量。完全证实了毛主席的“东风压倒西风”的英明论断。在这种形势面前，逼使美帝国主义不得不考虑改变某些方面的对外策略，打出所谓“致力于和平事业”的招牌。但是，我们应该看到，美国一面空谈和平，一面却死抱着所谓“威慑力量”“实力政策”不放。最近，它又勾结日本反动势力，签订了敌视中、苏，威胁亚洲各国和加剧远东紧张局势的日美“共同合作和安全条约”。这一切都告诉我们：美帝国主义的策略可以有某些改变，而侵略的本质和战争政策是不会改变的；帝国主义会使用真枪实弹和糖衣炮弹这两种武器；帝国主义有两种面目：一种是明目张胆的凶神恶煞的真面目，一种是梳装打扮的慈善为怀的假面具。但是它的目的只有一个，那就是保存帝国主义，消灭社会主义；保存反动力量，消灭进步力量；保存侵略者压迫者的“自由世界”，消灭人民的真正自由。在这样的形势面前，我们中国学生满怀信心地展望着我国和世界共产主义事业的光辉前景，一方面努力学习，积极参加我国的社会主义建设事业；一方面必须保持高度的警惕，同全世界爱好和平的人民团结起来，彻底揭露和粉碎美国的各种各样的假和平真备战的阴谋，挫败以美帝国主义为首的战争势力，使世界持久和平和人类进步事业得到真正可靠的保障。
    亲爱的同学们，我们全国六亿五千万人民，正在党和毛主席的英明领导下，干劲冲天，意气风发，迈入一个新的伟大的历史时期。祖国正日趋繁荣兴盛，我们的面前，是无限美好的现实，光明灿烂的未来。这一切都不断地激励和鼓舞着我们。我们青年人好像早晨八、九点钟的太阳，身强力壮、精力旺盛，应该人人壮志凌云，个个干劲冲天，做到学习最好，进步最快，贡献最多。让我们在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，更高地举起又红又专的旗帜，为早日把我们亲爱的祖国建设成为具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国而英勇奋斗。　（小题是本报编者加的）
