Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 11th: Representatives of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held talks on February 11th with a delegation from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany.

Participating in the talks on the Soviet side were: Suslov and Kuusinen, members of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and Secretaries of the Central Committee, and Ponomarev, member of the CPSU Central Committee; on the German side were: Max Reimann, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, Karl Zoemer, Thomas Wegner and Otto Baumann, members of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party.

The talks were conducted in a warm and friendly atmosphere. During the talks, the two sides exchanged views on current issues in the struggle for peace and democracy.

The talks demonstrated that the two parties hold completely identical views on the struggle for peace and democracy, against German militarism and revanchism, and against arming West Germany with atomic weapons. The Central Committee of the CPSU fully understands and acknowledges the struggle waged by the German Communist Party to achieve these great goals, to strengthen the unity of action of the working class, to unite all peace-loving forces, and to strive to restore the legal status of the German Communist Party.
