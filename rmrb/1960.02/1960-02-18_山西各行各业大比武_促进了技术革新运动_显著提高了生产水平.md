    A large-scale mass-based technical skills competition is a major characteristic of the mass movement on Shanxi Province's industrial front this year. The widespread technical skills competition has promoted the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the province's industrial and mining enterprises, rapidly improving workers' operational skills and enterprises' production levels. In the month or so since the competition began, the province has achieved 210,000 technical innovation projects and reformed and manufactured 95,700 sets of various equipment and tools. This equipment and tools have increased work efficiency by one, several, or even hundreds of times. The technical skills competition began in Shanxi Province's coal mine system. In December of last year, the Shanxi Provincial Coal Mine Administration, in order to reach the peak of coal mine production operation technology and promote the sustained leap forward in coal production, held a technical skills competition at the Taiyuan Xishan Coal Mine with more than 500 people from 11 bureaus (mines) participating. A judging committee was established, headed by Bureau Chief Jia Chongzhi, to judge each competition from an ideological and technical perspective. Through the competition, many difficult problems were overcome, and production efficiency was greatly improved. Many people originally thought that the underground conditions were poor, and it was difficult to improve tunneling efficiency. In order to tap the potential of this type of work, tunneling workers from nine mines including Datong, Yangquan, Luan, Taiyuan, Dongshan, and Taiyuan Xishan conducted arduous training during the competition. Finally, in a roadway with a cross-section of one cubic decimeter, a competition was held to see "who can tunnel one meter the fastest," which shortened the tunneling speed from 98 minutes to 65 minutes. In the past, many people thought that blasting had to be done with coal chutes. At the competition, blasting expert Bai Jishuan blasted in various coal seams without using chutes. People broke through conservative ideas and universally promoted this experience.
    The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee specifically studied this technical skills competition, believing that this competition broke through the circle of a few people doing and most people watching in general technical performances. It is an important method for leading mass technical innovation and technical revolution movements, and immediately convened a telephone conference to mobilize all industrial and transportation enterprises in the province to promote it comprehensively. Subsequently, the technical skills competition movement spread like wildfire to all industrial and transportation departments in the province, including factories, mines, postal and telecommunications, construction, railways, and highways. Because the railway system had heavy transportation tasks, the employees launched a competition with the goal of ensuring the completion of the first quarter's transportation plan ten days ahead of schedule. Postal and telecommunications employees conducted competitions around improving the efficiency of sorting, inspecting, sealing, and dispatching, improving the operational skills of delivery, and improving business proficiency. The machinery industry system made rapidly getting rid of manual operation the content of the technical skills competition. In this way, the competition became a powerful weapon for various departments to improve production.
    In the organization and evaluation of the competition, all units paid attention to grasping political ideology and collaborative assistance first. Workers not only compared technology but also compared style, which played a not small role in improving the ideological awareness of the broad masses of employees.
    At the beginning of this year, workers throughout the province launched a movement to advance towards advanced technical and economic indicators. All industrial enterprise units selected the most advanced national indicators as targets to catch up with. In the process of catching up, employees regarded the technical skills competition as a magic weapon, using advanced technical indicators as the goal, and launching various forms of training and competition activities. When the Yangquan City Weishe Iron Plant began to catch up with the small blast furnace of Sichuan Wanfu Iron and Steel Plant, the utilization coefficient of its own blast furnace was only 1.67, which was much lower than the opponent. In the process of catching up, raw material workers launched a large-scale competition of "guaranteeing the quality and quantity of ore supply," gas workers launched a large-scale competition of "uninterrupted and even supply of gas," and transportation workers launched a large-scale competition of "rapid loading and unloading of materials." In just over twenty days, the blast furnace utilization coefficient reached 5.146, and the highest reached 6.22. The Shanxi Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory originally had ten technical indicators lower than the nationally leading Shanghai Second Machinery Factory. Because employees adopted continuous competitions and collaborative competitions, they caught up with five indicators in the first round. At the end of December last year, only six indicators from two units, the Coal Geology Exploration Team and the Chemical Factory, reached the national advanced level in Yangquan City. Now, after only one month of catching up, forty-one technical and economic indicators from twenty-seven units, including the blast furnace utilization coefficient of Weishe Iron Plant, the full-member efficiency of Hanggou Coal Mine, the production worker efficiency of Fushan Coal Mine, and the daily load of the City Power Supply Bureau, have caught up with the national advanced level.
    The technical skills competition directly promoted the technical innovation movement. Employees regarded technical innovation as a means of catching up with the advanced, and many workers brought their improved tools to participate in the competition. In the technical skills competition of the sewing industry in Houma City, Jinnan Prefecture, novices could not beat a master's sewing speed many times. Later, the novices jointly manufactured an automatic sewing machine belt, connected the sewing machines together to rotate, and one person operated three machines, creating the province's highest sewing record. The Datong Mining Bureau launched a competition around breaking through the weak link of manual coal loading, and manufactured 300 coal scrapers in 48 hours, mechanizing all underground coal loading.
    Due to collective appraisal and mass evaluation of various operating techniques in the technical skills competition, this not only helps to identify advanced experiences but also stimulates employees' enthusiasm to adopt and learn advanced experiences, creating favorable conditions for the promotion and supporting of advanced experiences. In the technical skills competition movement, the Shanxi Province Basic Construction System selected high-efficiency native machines and foreign equipment to match, and equipped a total of fifteen dragons, including transportation machinery, bricklaying machinery, and indoor piping machinery, so that the construction work basically got rid of manual operation, and the work efficiency increased by one to four times compared with the past. In the competition, the Shanxi Coal Mine System focused on matching operating actions and equipped various rapid operating methods such as "rapidly moving the chute," "rapidly supporting the pillar," and "rapidly drilling and blasting." Through this month's competition, the Taiyuan City Industrial System has matched more than 800 sets of advanced experiences.

    山西各行各业大比武
    促进了技术革新运动　显著提高了生产水平
    本报太原17日电　广泛开展群众性的技术比武运动，是今年山西省工业战线上群众运动的一个大特点。技术比武的广泛开展，推动了全省工矿企业的技术革新和技术革命运动，使工人的操作技术和企业的生产水平迅速提高。从开始比武到现在的一个多月中，全省已经实现的技术革新项目达二十一万件，改革和制造的各种设备、工具有九万五千七百台套。这些设备和工具，使工作效率提高了一倍、数倍，甚至上百倍。技术比武是从山西省煤矿系统开始的。去年12月，山西省煤矿管理局为了攀登煤矿生产操作技术的高峰，推动煤炭生产的持续跃进，在太原西山煤矿举行了有十一个局（矿）的五百多人参加的技术比武现场会，以局长贾冲之为首成立了评判委员会，对每一场比武，都从思想上和技术上进行评判。通过比武，突破了许多困难问题，大大提高了生产效率。原来许多人认为井下条件不好，掘进效率提高比较困难。为了挖掘这个工种的潜力，大同、阳泉、潞安、太原、东山、太原西山等九个矿的掘进手，在比武期间进行了艰苦的操练，最后在一立分米断面的巷道里，以“掘进一米谁最快”开展了比武，使掘进速度由九十八分钟一下缩短到六十五分钟。过去许多人认为放炮必须打煤溜子，在比武场上，放炮能手白计栓在各种煤层里放炮，都不打溜子。人们破除了保守思想，普遍推广了这一经验。
    中共山西省委专门研究了这次技术比武，认为这次比武突破了一般的技术表演中少数人干，多数人看的圈子，是领导群众性技术革新和技术革命运动的重要方法，并立即召开电话会议，动员全省工业交通企业全面推广。接着，技术比武运动就势如破竹地在全省工厂、矿山、邮电、建筑、铁路、公路等一切工业交通部门普遍展开。铁路系统因为运输任务重，职工们就以保证提前十天完成第一季度运输计划为内容，展开了比武。邮电系统职工围绕着提高分、检、封、发效率，提高投递的操作技术和业务熟练程度进行比武。机械工业系统便把迅速摆脱手工操作当作技术比武的内容。这样，比武就成了各部门提高生产的有力武器。
    各单位在比武的组织和评判中，都注意首先抓政治思想和协作互助。工人们既比技术，又比风格，对于提高广大职工的思想觉悟起了不小作用。
    今年一开始，全省工人就掀起了向先进技术经济指标进军的运动。所有工业企业单位都选择了全国最先进的指标作为追赶目标。在追赶过程中，职工们把技术比武当作法宝，以先进技术指标为目标，展开各种各样的练武比武活动。阳泉市维社铁厂在开始追赶四川万福钢铁厂的小高炉时，自己高炉的利用系数只达一点六七，比对方低得多。在追赶过程中，原料工开展了“保质保量供应矿石”的大比武，煤气工开展了“不间断均匀供应煤气”大比武，运输工开展了“快速装料送料”大比武。仅仅二十多天，高炉利用系数就达到五点一四六，最高达到六点二二。山西经纬纺织机械厂原有十项技术指标低于全国领先的上海第二机械厂，由于职工们采取了连环比武，协作比武，第一个回合就赶上了五项。阳泉市在去年12月底，达到全国先进水平的只有煤炭地质勘探队和化工厂两个单位的六项指标。现在，仅仅经过一个月的追赶，就有维社铁厂的高炉利用系数、汗沟煤矿的全员效率、阜山煤矿的生产工效率、市供电所的日负荷等二十七个单位的四十一项技术经济指标，赶上了全国先进水平。
    技术比武直接促进了技术革新运动。职工们都把技术革新当作赶先进的手段，许多工人带着自己改进的工具参加比武。晋南专区侯马市的缝纫业在技术比武中，新手们多次都比不过一位老师傅的缝纫速度，后来新手们联合制成了缝纫机自动带，把缝纫机联在一起转动，一个人操作三台，创造了全省最高缝纫纪录。大同矿务局围绕突破手工装煤的薄弱环节展开比武，在四十八小时内，就制造出了三百台攉煤机，使井下装煤全部实现了机械化。
    由于在技术比武中对各种操作技术进行集体鉴定、群众性的评判，这不仅有助于识别先进经验，还激发了职工采用和学习先进经验的积极性，为先进经验的推广和配套创造了良好的条件。山西省基本建设系统在技术比武运动中，选择效率高的土机器和洋设备配套，共配成了运输机具、砌砖机具、室内配管机具等十五条龙，使建筑施工基本上摆脱了手工操作，工作效率比过去提高了一倍至四倍。山西煤矿系统在比武中，大抓操作动作配套，配成了“快速移溜子”、“快速支柱”、“快速打眼放炮”等多种快速操作法。太原市工业系统通过这一个月的比武，已把八百多套先进经验配成套。
