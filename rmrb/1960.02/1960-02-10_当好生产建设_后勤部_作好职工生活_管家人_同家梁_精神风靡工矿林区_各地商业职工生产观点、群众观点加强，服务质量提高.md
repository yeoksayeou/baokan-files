Act as a good "logistics department" for production and construction, and a good "housekeeper" for the lives of employees.
The "Tongjialiang" spirit sweeps through mining and forestry areas.
Commercial employees in various regions strengthen their production viewpoint and mass viewpoint, and improve service quality

(Reported by this newspaper) A mass movement of "Learn from Tongjialiang! Catch up with Tongjialiang!" is rapidly developing in stores in工mining and forestry areas across the country. The advanced experience of Tongjialiang Store in wholeheartedly serving production and serving the lives of employees has blossomed and borne fruit, powerfully supporting the development of production.

In the process of learning from the advanced experience of Tongjialiang Store, many regions first carried out pilot projects, and then held on-site meetings to promote it comprehensively. Up to now, provinces (regions) that have held on-site meetings or special meetings include Henan, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Jilin, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Guizhou. Commercial stores in various industrial, mining, and forestry areas have successively mobilized employees to examine their past work and formulate new plans. Many stores have also held oath-taking and skill-comparison meetings to learn from and catch up with Tongjialiang.

Through learning from Tongjialiang's advanced experience, the employees of commercial stores in various industrial, mining, and forestry areas have further strengthened their viewpoint of serving production. "Where production goes, supply goes; what is needed, supply what; when it is needed, supply when" has become the creed and action of store employees. During the movement to learn from and catch up with Tongjialiang, the Dongjia Duan Comprehensive Store in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, took the initiative to send people to factories, workshops, warehouses, and construction sites to understand production needs, formulate plans, and organize supplies, completely changing the past situation of "not going to the door without a sale, and not knowing what production needs." When the foundry workshop of Xiangjiang Machine Factory needed a large amount of pine firewood to ignite the furnace, the store learned about this situation in advance and immediately sent people to purchase it from the surrounding people's communes, meeting the needs in a timely manner. When the Fangzi Coal Mine Store in Shandong Province heard that there was an insufficient supply of safety caps for explosives used underground, even though this type of safety cap was not within the scope of the store's business, they immediately organized orders. In October of last year, they purchased 10,000 at a time to support production.

While vigorously supplying production materials, many stores have also added business outlets, adjusted business hours, and carried out mobile supply, delivering goods to the mines, workshops, construction sites, and mountains, supplying food, vegetables, cigarettes, alcohol, hot water, snacks, and daily necessities around the clock, greatly strengthening the supply work on the front lines of production. According to statistics from the stores in fifteen industrial and mining areas in Shanxi Province alone, since the launch of the movement, a total of twenty-two underground stores, thirty-three pithead restaurants, ninety-nine follow-up supply teams, nineteen part-time tuck shops, and fifty sales departments have been added. Many stores also give special care to night shift workers. Once, more than sixty workers at the Xilutian Mine in Fushun worked continuous night shifts. The employees of the Guchengzi Store made buns for them and delivered them. The workers were very moved and said, "The store has given us strength again!" They immediately convened a team meeting and changed the original plan of producing 16,000 tons per day to 17,000 tons, ultimately completing 17,321 tons. In addition to adding fixed supply points, this store also added reservation vending boxes at intersections that miners must pass through. Workers could write what they needed on a card and drop it in, and the commercial staff would then deliver the goods. Many stores also rely on the masses, mobilize the family members of employees, and set up resident consignment points, life service stations, neighborhood service centers, and all-purpose service departments to carry out a variety of services, so that employees do not have to worry about eating, dressing, sewing, mending, washing, dyeing, repairing tools, or even carrying patients, pregnant women, and caring for the old and young, and can concentrate on production.

In order to do a good job in the supply of non-staple foods, so that employees can eat well and have enough, many stores have adopted methods such as running their own operations, co-operating with people's communes, and helping communes to run them, vigorously developing pig breeding, poultry farming, vegetable planting, and establishing non-staple food production bases. The Shijingpo Trading Store in Chongqing City has raised more than 2,000 pigs and more than 10,000 poultry, and the store's restaurant can now completely supply its own meat. The Naizishan Trading Company in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, organized farmers and employees' family members in the mining area to grow more than 8,000 mu of vegetables, raise more than 250 pigs, and raise more than 6,000 poultry, so that the mining area had an average of one and a half catties of vegetables per person per day throughout the year, achieving complete self-sufficiency. During this period, some stores also held operating technology performance meetings to improve operating skills and do a better job of supply and service. Through the technical performance competition, the catering industry of the Qingchengzi Store in Liaoning Province created more than 90 new methods of making vegetarian dishes taste like meat, which were very popular among the employees.

During the movement, many moving deeds emerged in various places. Maerkang is one of the largest forest areas in Sichuan. In order to deliver various commodities to the forest workers in a timely manner, the commercial staff here often drive livestock or carry goods on their backs, crossing mountains and ridges to reach forest farms and work sections. On the way to deliver goods, they often spend the night in uninhabited wilderness. In order to allow the forest farm workers to eat fresh meat, once, Li Shiyu, the manager of the Matang Store, and two cadres went to drive cattle in the mountains five or sixty miles away overnight. The mountain road was dangerous and the sky was dark. Li Shiyu accidentally fell and broke his leg, but he still insisted on driving thirty cattle back. The communist style of "leaving the difficulties to oneself and giving convenience to others" has been further developed among store employees.

The employees of the工mining and forestry areas praised the commercial employees' improvement of service work very much. Many stores have received thousands of oral or written praises from the employees of工mining and forestry areas. At the same time, the industrial and mining enterprises also vigorously support the commercial work and provide assistance in various aspects.

The experience of Tongjialiang Store in serving industrial and mining production has undergone new development in the process of promotion. Now, some stores in cities and rural areas have also joined the movement.

    当好生产建设“后勤部”  作好职工生活“管家人”
    “同家梁”精神风靡工矿林区
    各地商业职工生产观点、群众观点加强，服务质量提高
    本报讯　“学同家梁！赶同家梁！”的群众运动，正在全国工矿林区商店中迅速开展。同家梁商店全心全意为生产服务、为职工生活服务的先进经验，已经开花结果，有力地支援了生产的发展。
    在学习同家梁商店先进经验的过程中，许多地区都是先行试点，然后召开现场会议全面推广。到现在为止，举行过现场会议或专门会议的，已有河南、山西、黑龙江、辽宁、吉林、湖南、湖北、江西、广东、广西、四川、贵州等省（区）。各地工矿林区商店，都先后发动职工检查了过去的工作，订出了新的规划，许多商店还举行了学、赶同家梁的誓师比武大会。
    通过学习同家梁的先进经验，各工矿林区商店的职工进一步加强了为生产服务的观点。“生产到哪里，供应到哪里，需要什么，供应什么，什么时候需要，什么时候供应”，已经成为商店职工的信条和行动。湖南株洲市董家塅综合商店在学、赶同家梁的运动中，主动抽派专人到工厂、车间、仓库、工地了解生产需要，制订计划，组织供应，彻底改变了过去“不为买卖不上门，生产要啥搞不清”的状况。湘江机器厂翻砂车间需要大量松柴引火干炉，这个商店事先了解到这个情况，立即派人到郊区人民公社采购，及时满足了需要。山东坊子煤矿商店听说井下用的炸药安全套供应不足，虽然这种安全套不属于商店经营范围，可是他们立即组织订货，去年10月份一次就购进了一万个，支援了生产。
    在大力供应生产资料的同时，许多商店还增设了营业网点，调整了营业时间，开展了流动供应，送货到井下、到车间、到工地、到山头，昼夜不停地供应饭、菜、烟、酒、热水、小吃，以及生活用品，大大加强了生产第一线的供应工作。仅据山西省十五个工矿区商店的统计，运动开展以来，共增设井下商店二十二个，坑口饭店三十三个，跟班供应组九十九个，业余小卖部十九个，门市部五十个。许多商店对夜班工人还给予特别照顾。抚顺西露天矿有一次有六十多个工人连班夜战，古城子商店职工给他们做好了包子送来。工人们非常感动，说：“商店又给我们送来力量了！”立即召开了小组会，把原来日产一万六千吨的计划改为一万七千吨，结果完成一万七千三百二十一吨。这个商店除了增设固定供应点以外，还在矿工必经的路口增设了预约售货箱，工人需要什么就写个卡片投进去，商业工作人员随后就把商品送到。不少商店还依靠群众，发动职工家属，大办居民代销点、生活服务站、邻里服务所、万能服务部，开展多种服务，使职工吃饭穿衣、缝补洗染、修配用具，甚至抬送病人、产妇，照顾老幼，都不用操心，而能安心生产。
    为了作好副食品的供应工作，使职工吃得好、吃得足，许多商店采取自办、与人民公社合办、帮助公社举办等办法，大力发展养猪、养禽、种菜，建立副食品生产基地。重庆市石井坡贸易商店已养猪二千多头，家禽一万多只，商店餐厅用肉已能全部自给。吉林蛟河县奶子山贸易公司组织矿区农民和职工家属种菜八千多亩，养猪二百五十多头，养禽六千多只，使矿区全年平均每人每天有蔬菜一斤半，做到完全自给。这一时期，有些商店还举行了操作技术表演会，提高了操作技术，把供应服务工作作得更好。辽宁青城子商店饮食业通过技术表演赛，就创造了九十多种素菜荤作的新方法，很受职工群众欢迎。
    在运动中，各地都出现了许多动人的事迹。马尔康是四川的大森林区之一。这里的商业工作人员为了及时把各种商品送到林区工人手中，经常赶着牲口或背着商品，翻山越岭赶到林场、工段。送货途中，他们时常在没有人烟的野地上过夜。为了让林场工人吃到鲜肉，有一次，马塘商店的经理李士虞和两个干部，连夜到五、六十里以外的山上去赶牛，山路险，天又黑，李士虞失脚跌坏了腿，但他仍然坚持着把三十头牛赶了回来。“把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人”的共产主义风格，在商店职工中有了进一步的发扬。
    工矿林区的职工对商业职工改进服务工作非常赞扬。许多商店都收到工矿林区职工数以千百计的口头或书面表扬。同时，工矿企业也大力支持商业工作，在各方面给予帮助。
    同家梁商店为工矿生产服务的经验在推广过程中有了新的发展。现在，有些城市和农村的商店也投入到运动中来了。
