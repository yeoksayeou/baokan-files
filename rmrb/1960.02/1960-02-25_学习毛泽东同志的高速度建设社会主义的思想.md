Studying Comrade Mao Zedong's Thought on Building Socialism at High Speed
Su Xing

The issue of speed is the most important issue in our socialist construction. Developing the national economy at a leaping speed is the soul of the general line for building socialism.

The possibility of high-speed development in China's construction cause was fully estimated by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong on the eve of the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution. In March 1949, the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party pointed out: "The speed of China's economic construction will not be very slow, but may be quite fast, and China's prosperity can be achieved in the near future." In the winter of 1955, when the socialist revolution of the ownership of the means of production in our country was about to be completed, Comrade Mao Zedong further pointed out: "In the future, there will be all kinds of undertakings that people have never imagined, several times, ten times, or even dozens of times the current high yields of crops. The development of industry, transportation, and exchange will be even more unimaginable to predecessors. The same is true for science, culture, education, health and other undertakings.” The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong not only scientifically predicted the possibility of high-speed development of socialist construction in our country, but also summarized and generalized China's construction experience in 1958, formulated the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and a whole set of construction policies of "walking on two legs," and found a road suitable for China's specific conditions for carrying out socialist construction at high speed. The practice of continuous great leaps forward in 1958 and 1959 proved that China's socialist construction has entered a new stage, that is, the stage of sustained leap forward of the national economy at a higher speed than during the first five-year plan. This is a great victory for Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on building socialism at high speed.

The thought of building socialism at high speed is an important part of Comrade Mao Zedong's economic thought. Comrade Mao Zedong creatively applied the principles of materialist dialectics, profoundly revealed the relationship between production relations and productive forces, superstructure and base, speed and proportion, objective possibility and subjective initiative in the process of socialist economic development, and found the factors that determine the high-speed development of socialist construction. The following is a personal understanding of this issue.
  Correctly handle the relationship between production relations and productive forces

The contradiction between production relations and productive forces is the fundamental driving force for the development and change of all social forms. The development of productive forces is the prerequisite for the change of production relations. Conversely, the change of production relations will promote the rapid development of productive forces. This basic principle of Marxism-Leninism also applies to socialist and communist societies.

There was once an idea that it seems that in socialist society, production relations and productive forces are completely adapted and there are no contradictions. This idea is incorrect. According to the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, Comrade Mao Zedong criticized this view and clearly pointed out: "In socialist society, the basic contradiction remains the contradiction between production relations and productive forces, and the contradiction between superstructure and economic base. However, these contradictions in socialist society have fundamentally different nature and circumstances from the contradictions between production relations and productive forces and the contradictions between superstructure and economic base in the old society." Comrade Mao Zedong did not deny that the socialist production relations have a side suitable for the development of productive forces; however, he saw deeper and further, and saw that the development of socialist society is still carried out in the contradiction between production relations and productive forces, and technological changes and corresponding economic relations will continue to occur. Because Comrade Mao Zedong clarified the dialectical relationship between production relations and productive forces under socialism, people's horizons have been broadened and they have found the fundamental driving force for the high-speed development of the national economy. When dealing with the contradiction between production relations and productive forces, people no longer take an evasive attitude, but face this contradiction squarely and improve and adjust it in a timely manner. Experience has proved that timely improvement or adjustment of production relations according to the requirements of the development of productive forces is the basic prerequisite for the continuous leap forward of the national economy. People have seen that the leaping situation of socialist construction in our country in 1956 occurred after the socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production was basically completed. The great leap forward since 1958 is the direct result of realizing the people's commune and adjusting the relationship between people within and between state-owned enterprises during the all-people rectification movement.

In 1956, after the realization of agricultural cooperation, some people believed that collective ownership had been established in the countryside, and there was no need to change the production relations any more, at least it could remain stable for a long period of time. However, Comrade Mao Zedong did not see it that way. As early as the upsurge of the agricultural cooperation movement, Comrade Mao Zedong had already foreseen that with the development of productive forces, the production relations of agricultural producers' cooperatives would inevitably have to be adjusted. Later, in his article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Comrade Mao Zedong further pointed out: "The completely socialist cooperatives still need to continue to solve some individual problems in ownership." The great leap forward in socialist construction in 1958 fully confirmed Comrade Mao Zedong's prediction. Due to the great leap forward in production, the original small-scale advanced cooperatives that only managed agriculture could no longer meet the requirements of developing production. Therefore, large-scale, integrated industrial, agricultural, commercial, educational and military organizations, with comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations and fishery, and the integration of government and commune, appeared everywhere. In the face of the new situation, Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the experience of the masses and pointed out: Our direction should be to gradually and orderly organize industry, agriculture, commerce (exchange), education (culture and education), and military (militia, that is, national armed forces) into a large commune, becoming the basic unit of the combination of workers, peasants, merchants, students and soldiers in the structure of socialist society in our country, and also the basic unit of socialist political power organizations. Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on the people's commune is the theoretical basis for the rapid realization of the people's commune in our country, and is a brilliant example of creatively handling the contradiction between production relations and productive forces under socialism and promoting the high-speed development of the national economy. In 1959, we encountered disasters that had not been seen in decades. The disaster-stricken area accounted for 30% of the total sown area. However, thanks to the superior system of the people's commune, Chinese farmers overcame serious natural disasters, and not only did not reduce production, but also achieved a huge victory with a total agricultural output value increase of 16.7%, a grain output increase of 8%, and a cotton output increase of 14.76% on the basis of the extraordinary bumper harvest in 1958. This is the most powerful proof that the production relations of the people's commune promote the development of productive forces!

Comrade Mao Zedong has always paid attention to adjusting the relationship between people within and between state-owned enterprises. This issue was specifically discussed in the report "On the Ten Major Relationships" and the article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," pointing out that "the mutual relations of production and exchange in various economic sectors are still being gradually established according to socialist principles, and are gradually finding more appropriate forms." In 1957, during the rectification movement, the criticism of bureaucracy and departmentalism brought about tremendous changes in the mutual relations between socialist enterprises. Due to the resolute implementation of the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee, cadres participating in labor, workers directly participating in part of the daily management work, the implementation of the three-in-one combination of cadres, workers and technicians, and the improvement of various aspects of relations caused by the reform of unreasonable rules and regulations, all greatly improved the workers' labor enthusiasm and the sense of responsibility of the working class. Between enterprises, the communist style of cooperation was greatly promoted, sweeping away the remnants of the departmentalist ideology and bourgeois style of the past that used to "pass the buck" to each other. The relationship between top and bottom, left and right has changed in the enterprise, the relationship between people has improved, and the labor enthusiasm of the laborers has been improved, which immediately promoted the development of production and ushered in the situation of the great leap forward in 1958.

Comrade Mao Zedong not only paid attention to the improvement and adjustment of production relations in a timely manner according to the requirements of the development of productive forces, but also was able to seize the opportunity to put forward the task of developing productive forces after the improvement and adjustment of production relations. After the upsurge of agricultural cooperation, he immediately put forward the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) from 1956 to 1967" to the people of the whole country; after the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, he immediately put forward the combat call to catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in terms of steel and other major industrial product outputs in fifteen years, as well as the historical tasks of technological revolution and cultural revolution; after the people's commune, he immediately raised the task of agricultural modernization to the people of the whole country .

The contradiction between productive forces and production relations is developing. In the process of socialist construction and the transition to communism, with the development of productive forces, production relations will continue to be improved and adjusted. We must never only see productive forces and not see production relations, or ignore the changes and adjustments of production relations. Because failure to correctly handle the relationship between the two cannot guarantee the sustained leap forward of the national economy.
  Correctly handle the relationship between superstructure and base

Correctly handling the relationship between the superstructure and the base also has an important role in the high-speed development of the national economy.

Some people once believed that in socialist society, since the superstructure is generated from and adapted to the base, the two are consistent and there should be no contradictions. This view is incorrect. Contrary to this view, Comrade Mao Zedong believed that in socialist society, the contradiction between the superstructure and the base is still the basic contradiction, and we must adjust this contradiction in a timely manner to promote the development of productive forces.

Under socialist conditions, the contradiction between the superstructure and the base is specifically manifested in the following aspects: First, after the socialist transformation in the ownership of the means of production is basically completed, the socialist revolution has not ended, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, "The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, and the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological field are still long-term, tortuous, and sometimes even very fierce.The proletariat must transform the world according to its own world outlook, and the bourgeoisie must also transform the world according to its own world outlook." Therefore, the socialist revolution must not be limited to the economic front, but must also carry out the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. Even if the socialist revolution has won several battles on the political and ideological fronts and achieved a decisive victory, this struggle will continue to rise and fall, rise and fall, sometimes sharply and sometimes slowly, until the political and ideological influence of the bourgeoisie at home and abroad is finally eliminated; Second, in socialist society, the superstructure and the base are basically adapted, but there will still be defects in some aspects of the political system. Although resolving this contradiction does not require changing the fundamental nature of the superstructure, it still needs to be adjusted in a timely manner. Third, along with the development of productive forces and production relations, new contradictions will continue to arise between the superstructure and the economic base, and these contradictions need to be constantly overcome by people. Contradictions are constantly produced and overcome, overcome and then produced. This is a ceaseless, ever-changing dialectical process.

The most vivid example of correctly handling the relationship between the superstructure and the base, thereby promoting the great leap forward of the national economy, is the all-people rectification movement in 1957 and the struggle against the bourgeois rightists.

The rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle were a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. This revolution greatly inspired the enthusiasm and initiative of the people in building socialism, and greatly hit and weakened the reactionary influence of the exploiting classes in the political and ideological fields. On this basis, Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the policy of "giving prominence to politics," strengthened the Party's leadership over economic work and other various tasks, and fundamentally solved the problem of what channels to mainly use to mobilize people's production enthusiasm in socialist society.

According to Marx, socialist society "is a communist society that has just emerged from capitalist society, and therefore still retains the traces of the old society from which it was born in all aspects, namely in the economic, moral and intellectual aspects." In such a stage, it is necessary to implement distribution according to work and take care of the individual material interests of laborers, which is also beneficial to the development of production. However, this principle of distribution still bears the traces of the old society. Relying on it alone cannot enable people to correctly understand the relationship between collective and long-term interests and individual and current interests, nor can it fully mobilize the enthusiasm of laborers. On the contrary, one-sided emphasis on material incentives will also foster economistic ideas such as "putting money in command," "paying according to labor," and "nitpicking," and corrode the revolutionary will of the working class and the working people. Comrade Mao Zedong's "giving prominence to politics" fundamentally solved the relationship between politics and economy, communist education and concern for the material interests of laborers, and raising collective material interests and raising individual material interests under socialist conditions, and found the decisive factor in encouraging the enthusiasm of laborers: giving prominence to politics first, and material incentives can only be second.

After the rectification movement, Comrade Mao Zedong also put forward the slogan "Break superstitions, emancipate the mind, and carry forward the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act" to the people of the whole country, encouraging people to dare to break superstitions, innovate and create, adhere to the truth, and charge for the truth. Under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought, the spiritual outlook of the Chinese people underwent a very great change in 1958. The oppressed's mark of superstition, fear, and inferiority complex left in people's spiritual state under the oppression of foreign aggressors for more than a hundred years was swept away, and everyone was full of fighting spirit and high spirits. This was an important factor in 1958's great leap forward.

Experience has proved that as long as we can correctly handle the relationship between the superstructure and the base, the sustained leap forward of the national economy will have an important guarantee.
  Correctly handle the relationship between the development speed and proportion of the national economy

High-speed and proportional development of the national economy is a characteristic of the socialist economy. However, in the past, people often regarded proportional relations as rigid and fixed things, and even opposed the two.

Starting from the point of view of dialectical materialism and from the practice of socialist construction in our country, Comrade Mao Zedong not only demonstrated the possibility of high-speed development of the socialist economy and the specific ways to turn possibility into reality; but also further clarified the law of proportional development of the national economy and the policy of correctly handling the relationship between speed and proportion. This includes: a whole set of policies of "walking on two legs"; the arrangement of basic proportional relations in the national economy; the arrangement of key points and general points in proportional relations; balance and imbalance, positive balance and negative balance; the combination of soaring enthusiasm and scientific analysis in planning methods, the combination of continuous leap forward and leaving room for maneuver, the combination of long-term planning and short-term planning, and the idea of "the whole country as one chessboard," and so on. Comrade Mao Zedong's thoughts, both theoretically and practically, raised the theory that the national economy should develop at high speed and in proportion to a new and higher stage.

The proportion in the development process of the national economy refers to the proportion of the two major categories of social production and various departments of the national economy in the process of socialist reproduction. From all these proportional relations, Comrade Mao Zedong selected the proportion of industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry as the proportional relations that determine the development of the entire national economy. In the report "On the Ten Major Relationships," Comrade Mao Zedong placed the correct handling of the relationship between industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry in the most important position. In "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Comrade Mao Zedong further regarded the relationship between heavy industry, light industry and agriculture as the path to China's industrialization, believing that

"Our country's economic construction is centered on heavy industry, and this must be affirmed. However, at the same time, we must pay full attention to the development of agriculture and light industry." Comrade Mao Zedong's thoughts were later summarized as the policy of "developing industry and agriculture simultaneously and developing heavy industry and light industry simultaneously under the conditions of giving priority to the development of heavy industry," which is included in the basic points of the Party's general line for building socialism.

Industry and agriculture are two basic departments of social production. They are combined with each other, conditional on each other, and promote each other. Agriculture is the basis for industrial development. The great significance of agriculture in the development of the national economy is not only because the development of heavy industry and light industry must exchange consumer goods and means of production with agriculture; but also because only when agriculture is developed can it provide more funds and labor force to accelerate the development of industry and the entire national economy. Marx once said: "The less time society needs to produce wheat and livestock, etc., the more time it has to carry out other production - material and spiritual production." This principle is also completely applicable to socialist construction. Comrade Mao Zedong theoretically and practically solved the relationship between heavy industry, light industry and agriculture in the process of socialist construction, and found a completely correct path for us to realize socialist industrialization in our country; found a way to develop the national economy at both high speed and in proportion; and found a correct policy to further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and mobilize the enthusiasm of 500 million farmers to build socialism. The practice of the continuous great leap forward of the national economy in 1958 and 1959 proves that this is a completely correct path.

Comrade Mao Zedong not only correctly solved the relationship between industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry, but also correctly solved the relationship between central industry and local industry, large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, foreign-style production and indigenous production in the development of industrial and agricultural production, and put forward a whole set of policies of "walking on two legs." In the arrangement of proportional relations, he put forward the policy of "taking steel as the key link" in industry and "taking grain as the key link" in agriculture, with the key points leading the general points, promoting all-round leap forward. Practice has proved that these policies are completely correct. With these policies as guidance, we can fully mobilize the enthusiasm of 650 million people to build socialism, appropriately arrange the proportional relations of the national economy, and ensure the sustained leap forward of the national economy.

Comrade Mao Zedong also criticized the metaphysical view of passive equilibrium, and clearly pointed out that in the process of socialist reproduction, equilibrium is relative, and imbalance is absolute. "The so-called equilibrium is the temporary and relative unity of contradictions." Therefore, in the process of socialist expanded reproduction, there is nothing terrible about imbalance. On the contrary, it should be regarded as a good thing. As long as we adopt the method of positive equilibrium instead of the method of negative equilibrium, we can promote backward departments to catch up with advanced departments, establish new equilibrium, and make the entire national economy move forward at a leaping speed.

Comrade Mao Zedong clarified the relationship between equilibrium and imbalance in the socialist economy, but he did not advocate that the more imbalance the better. On the contrary, he paid great attention to the comprehensive balance of the national economy. In planning work, he required the combination of soaring enthusiasm and scientific analysis, the combination of continuous leap forward and leaving room for maneuver, the combination of long-term planning and short-term planning, and the establishment of the idea of "the whole country as one chessboard." The national economic plan is the superstructure, and whether it can better conform to the development of the objective economic process is closely related to people's thinking. We must arm our minds with Comrade Mao Zedong's planning thought, so that our planning work is more in line with the development of the objective economy, both active and reliable, and ensures the high-speed and proportional development of the national economy.
  Correctly handle the relationship between objective possibility and subjective initiative

On the issue of solving the speed of socialist construction, Comrade Mao Zedong paid attention to objective conditions. He once told us: "No one can think wildly without basis, or plan his actions beyond the conditions permitted by objective circumstances, and do not force yourself to do things that are really impossible." However, Comrade Mao Zedong is fundamentally different from those who advocate "conditionalism." He does not fix the conditions, making people feel powerless in the face of conditions. On the contrary, he believes that conditions are only the possibility of things, and what determines the possibility to become reality and further change the conditions is people's conscious dynamic role. Comrade Mao Zedong wrote in "On Protracted War": "Everything has to be done by people, and protracted war and final victory will not appear without people doing it. To do it, someone must first draw ideas, principles, opinions, plans, guidelines, policies, strategies, and tactics based on objective facts in order to do it well. Thoughts and so on are subjective things, and doing or acting is subjective things seen in objective things. They are all the special dynamic roles of human beings. We call this dynamic role 'conscious dynamic role,' which is the characteristic that distinguishes people from things. All thoughts based on and conforming to objective facts are correct thoughts, and all doing or actions based on correct thoughts are correct actions. We must carry forward such thoughts and actions, and we must carry forward this conscious dynamic role." These principles are fully applicable to socialist construction.

In the process of socialist construction, people's conscious dynamic role is mainly manifested in two aspects: on the one hand, due to the leadership of the Communist Party armed with Marxism-Leninism and the existence of the proletarian dictatorship, people can understand the laws of development of the objective economic process and formulate lines, principles, policies, and plans that conform to objective reality; on the other hand, people put the lines, principles, policies, and plans into action, so that the will of millions of people is concentrated, and it becomes a huge and invincible force. This force can turn the world upside down and create a new world.

Some people think that our emphasis on subjective initiative seems to ignore objective laws. This is a misunderstanding. In fact, the conscious dynamic role that Comrade Mao Zedong talked about itself includes the understanding of objective laws.

Paying attention to people's conscious dynamic role is the central link of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on building socialism at high speed. In April 1958, Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "In addition to the leadership of the Party, 600 million people are a decisive factor. More people have more discussions, higher enthusiasm, and greater drive." This is a thorough dialectical materialist conclusion. In the entire process of human history, people, as laborers and creators and users of production tools, are the decisive factors of productive forces. However, in class society, laborers are exploited and oppressed, and their intelligence and labor enthusiasm have been suppressed for a long time. After the revolution, their infinite wisdom and power were unfrozen by the spring breeze, and for the first time it became possible to fully发挥them. In this case, as long as we believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and implement the method of the mass line to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, the great creative power of the people will create earth-shattering miracles with the force of thunder.

The experience of the great leap forward in 1958 and 1959 proves that the revolutionary mass movement is the fundamental guarantee for implementing the general line. Without the great mass strength, it is just empty talk to go all out and aim high; without a mass movement that is both vigorous and down-to-earth, it is impossible to build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Therefore, to adhere to the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune, the first thing is to adhere to the revolutionary mass movement.

The strong desire of the liberated 650 million people in our country to rapidly change the poor and backward face of our country is the determining factor for the high-speed development of the national economy. Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on building socialism at high speed is the concentrated expression of this urgent desire of hundreds of millions of people. Let us better study Comrade Mao Zedong's thoughts and, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, continuously and at high speed develop the socialist construction cause of our country.

    学习毛泽东同志的高速度建设社会主义的思想
    苏星
    速度问题，是我国社会主义建设的最重要的问题。国民经济采取跃进的速度向前发展，是建设社会主义的总路线的灵魂。
    我国的建设事业，高速度发展的可能性，早在中国人民革命胜利的前夕，党中央和毛泽东同志已经做了充分的估计。1949年3月，党的七届二中全会的决议指出：“中国经济建设的速度将不是很慢而可能是相当快的，中国的兴盛是可以计日程功的。”1955年冬季，我国生产资料所有制的社会主义革命即将完成的时候，毛泽东同志进一步指出：“将来会出现从来没有被人们设想过的种种事业，几倍、十几倍以至几十倍于现在的农作物的高产量。工业、交通和交换事业的发展，更是前人所不能设想的。科学、文化、教育、卫生等项事业也是如此。”党中央和毛泽东同志不但科学地预见到我国社会主义建设高速度发展的可能性，而且在1958年总结和概括了我国的建设经验，制定了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的建设方针，找到了一条适合于中国具体条件的用高速度进行社会主义建设的道路。1958年和1959年连续大跃进的实践证明我国的社会主义建设开始了一个新的阶段，即国民经济以比第一个五年计划期间更高的速度持续跃进的阶段。这是毛泽东同志关于高速度建设社会主义的思想的伟大胜利。
    高速度建设社会主义的思想，是毛泽东同志的经济思想的重要组成部分。毛泽东同志创造性的运用唯物辩证法的原理，深刻地揭明了社会主义经济发展过程中，生产关系和生产力、上层建筑和基础、速度和比例、客观可能性和主观能动性之间的关系，找到了决定社会主义建设高速度发展的因素。下面谈谈个人对这个问题的体会。
  正确处理生产关系和生产力之间的关系
    生产关系和生产力之间的矛盾，是一切社会形态发展变化的根本动力。生产力的发展，是生产关系发生变革的前提，反过来，生产关系的变革，又会促进生产力的迅速发展。马克思列宁主义的这个基本原理，同样适用于社会主义和共产主义社会。
    曾经有过一种想法，好像在社会主义社会，生产关系和生产力之间完全适应，没有矛盾了。这种想法是不正确的。毛泽东同志根据马克思列宁主义的基本原则，批判了这种观点，明确指出：“在社会主义社会中，基本的矛盾仍然是生产关系和生产力之间的矛盾，上层建筑和经济基础之间的矛盾。不过社会主义社会的这些矛盾，同旧社会的生产关系和生产力的矛盾、上层建筑和经济基础的矛盾，具有根本不同的性质和情况罢了。”毛泽东同志并不否认社会主义的生产关系有适合于生产力发展性质的一面；但是，他看得更深更远，看到社会主义社会的发展，依然是在生产关系和生产力的矛盾中进行着的，技术变革以及相应的经济关系的变革将会继续不断地发生。由于毛泽东同志阐明了社会主义条件下生产关系和生产力的辩证关系，人们的眼界开阔了，找到了决定国民经济高速度发展的根本动力。对待生产关系和生产力的矛盾，人们不再采取回避的态度，而是正视这种矛盾，及时地加以改善和调整。经验证明，根据生产力发展的要求，及时地改善或调整生产关系，是国民经济持续跃进的基本前提。人们都看到，我国1956年社会主义建设的跃进局面，就是在生产资料所有制方面社会主义革命基本完成以后出现的。1958年以来的大跃进，则是实现人民公社化，和在全民整风运动当中，调整全民所有制企业内部和企业之间的人和人的关系的直接结果。
    1956年，农业合作化实现以后，曾经有人认为，农村已经建立了集体所有制，生产关系不必再进行变革了，至少在一个很长的期间，可以稳定不变。但是，毛泽东同志不是这样看。早在农业合作化运动高潮当中，毛泽东同志就已经预见到，随着生产力的发展，农业生产合作社的生产关系势必要进行调整。后来毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部的矛盾”一文中，又进一步指出：“完全社会主义化的合作社在所有制的某些个别问题上，还需要继续解决。”1958年社会主义建设的大跃进，完全证实了毛泽东同志的预见。由于生产大跃进，原来小规模的单纯经营农业的高级社已经不能适应发展生产的要求了，于是到处都出现了大规模的、工农商学兵五位一体、农林牧副渔全面发展和政社合一的新的社会组织形式。在新的形势面前，毛泽东同志概括了群众的经验，指出：我们的方向，应当逐步地有次序地把工（工业）、农（农业）、商（交换）、学（文化教育）、兵（民兵，即全民武装）组成为一个大公社，成为我国社会主义社会结构的工农商学兵相结合的基层单位，同时又是社会主义政权组织的基层单位。毛泽东同志关于人民公社的思想，是我国人民公社化迅速实现的理论基础，是创造性的处理社会主义条件下生产关系和生产力的矛盾，促进国民经济高速度发展的光辉范例。1959年我们遇到的灾害是几十年所未曾有过的，全国受灾面积占全部播种面积的30％。但是，由于有了人民公社这样一个优越的制度，我国农民战胜了严重的自然灾害，不但没有减产，而且在1958年特大丰收的基础上，又取得了农业总产值增长16．7％，粮食产量增长8％，棉花产量增长14．76％的巨大胜利。这就是人民公社生产关系促进生产力发展最有力的证明！
    毛泽东同志一直注意调整全民所有制企业内部和企业之间人和人的关系。在“十大关系”的报告和“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”一文里都专门论述过这个问题，指出“在各经济部门中的生产和交换的相互关系，还在按照社会主义的原则逐步建立，逐步找寻比较适当的形式。”1957年，在整风运动当中，批判了官僚主义和本位主义思想，社会主义企业内部和企业之间的相互关系有了巨大的变化。由于坚决贯彻了党委领导下的厂长负责制，干部参加劳动，工人直接参加一部分日常管理工作，实行了干部、工人和技术人员三结合的办法，由于改革了不合理的规章制度而引起的各方面关系的改善，这些都大大地提高了工人的劳动热情和工人阶级的责任感。在企业之间则大兴共产主义协作之风，一扫过去那种互相“扯皮”的本位主义思想和资产阶级作风的残余。在企业里上下左右的关系改变了，人和人之间的关系改善了，劳动者的生产积极性提高了，立即促进了生产的发展，出现了1958年的大跃进的局面。
    毛泽东同志不但根据生产力发展的要求，及时注意生产关系的改善和调整，而且能够在生产关系改善和调整以后，抓住时机提出发展生产力的任务。在农业合作化高潮以后，马上就向全国人民提出了“1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要草案”；经过整风运动和反右派斗争，紧接着就提出了十五年在钢铁和其他主要工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国的战斗号召，以及技术革命和文化革命的历史任务；人民公社化以后，又立刻把农业现代化的任务提到了全国人民的面前。
    生产关系和生产力的矛盾是发展的，在社会主义建设和向共产主义过渡的过程中，随着生产力的发展，生产关系还会不断地改进和调整，我们决不能只见生产力，不见生产关系，或者忽视生产关系的变革和调整。因为不能正确处理两者之间的关系，就不能保证国民经济的持续跃进。
      正确处理上层建筑和基础之间的关系
    正确处理上层建筑和基础的关系，对国民经济的高速度发展，也具有重要的作用。
    曾经有人认为，在社会主义社会，上层建筑既然是由基础产生，并且和基础相适应，两者是一致的，不应该有矛盾了。这种观点是不对的。和这种观点相反，毛泽东同志认为：在社会主义社会中，上层建筑和基础的矛盾，仍然是基本矛盾，我们要及时地调整这种矛盾，促进生产力的发展。
    在社会主义条件下，上层建筑和基础之间的矛盾，具体的表现在以下几个方面：第一、在生产资料所有制方面的社会主义改造基本完成以后，社会主义革命并没有结束，正如毛泽东同志所说“无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。”因此，社会主义革命决不能局限于经济战线上，还必须在政治战线上和思想战线上进行社会主义革命。即使在政治战线思想战线上打过几次胜仗，社会主义已经取得了决定性的胜利，在国内外资产阶级的政治思想影响没有最后消灭以前，这种斗争还是会时起时伏，时高时低，时而尖锐，时而缓和地继续下去；第二、在社会主义社会，上层建筑和基础在基本上是相适应的，但是政治制度的某些环节上还会有缺陷。解决这种矛盾虽然不需要变革上层建筑的根本性质，仍然需要及时地加以调整。第三、伴同生产力和生产关系的发展，上层建筑和经济基础之间，还会不断出现新的矛盾，这些矛盾，需要人们不断地去克服。矛盾不断地产生而又克服，克服而又产生，这是一个川流不息，万古常新的辩证过程。
    正确处理上层建筑和基础的关系，从而推动国民经济大跃进的最鲜明的例证，是1957年的全民整风运动和反对资产阶级右派的斗争。
    整风运动和反右派斗争，是一场政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命，这个革命，大大地鼓舞了人民群众的建设社会主义的积极性和主动性，大大地打击和削弱了剥削阶级在政治领域和思想领域中的反动影响。在这个基础上，毛泽东同志提出了“政治挂帅”的方针，加强了党对经济工作和其他各种工作的领导，并且从根本上解决了在社会主义社会主要通过什么途径调动人们的生产积极性的问题。
    社会主义社会，按照马克思的说法：“是刚刚从资本主义社会中产生出来，因此在各方面，即在经济、道德和智慧方面都还保留其所由脱胎出来的那个旧社会痕迹的共产主义社会”，在这样一个阶段，实行按劳分配，照顾劳动者个人的物质利益，是需要的，对生产发展也是有利的。但是，这种分配原则毕竟带有旧社会的痕迹，仅靠它并不能使人们正确的认识集体的、长远的利益和个人的、目前的利益的关系，也不能充分地调动劳动者的积极性。相反的，片面强调物质鼓励，还会助长“钞票挂帅”、“按酬付劳”、“斤斤计较”之类的经济主义思想，腐蚀工人阶级和劳动人民的革命意志。毛泽东同志提出“政治挂帅”，就从根本上解决了在社会主义条件下政治和经济、共产主义教育和关心劳动者物质利益、提高集体物质利益和提高个人物质利益之间的关系，找到了鼓舞劳动者积极性的决定因素：政治挂帅第一，物质鼓励只能居于第二位。
    在整风运动以后，毛泽东同志还向全国人民提出了“破除迷信，解放思想，发扬敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格”的口号，鼓励人们敢于破除迷信，革新创造，坚持真理，为真理而冲锋陷阵。在毛泽东同志的思想的指导下，1958年中国人民的精神面貌起了一个非常巨大的变化。一百多年以来在外国侵略者压迫下留在人们精神状态里的被压迫者的烙印——迷信、恐惧和自卑感一扫而光了，人人斗志昂扬，意气风发，这是1958年大跃进的一个重要因素。
    经验证明，只要我们能够正确地处理上层建筑和基础的关系，国民经济的持续跃进就有了重要保证。
    正确处理国民经济发展速度和比例的关系
    国民经济高速度、按比例地发展，是社会主义经济的特征。但是，过去人们往往把比例关系看作僵化的，固定不变的东西，甚至把二者对立起来。
    毛泽东同志从辩证唯物论的观点出发，从我国的社会主义建设实践出发，不但论证了社会主义经济高速度发展的可能性和把可能性变为现实性的具体途径；而且进一步阐明了国民经济按比例发展的规律性以及正确处理速度和比例关系的方针。这里面包括：一整套“两条腿走路”的方针；国民经济中基本比例关系的安排；比例关系中重点与一般的安排；平衡和不平衡、积极平衡和消极平衡；在计划方法上的冲天干劲和科学分析结合、持续跃进和留有余地结合、长期规划和短期计划结合以及“全国一盘棋”的思想等等。毛泽东的这些思想，从理论上和实践上把国民经济既要高速度又要按比例发展的理论，提到了新的更高的阶段。
    国民经济发展过程中的比例，是指社会主义再生产过程中，社会生产两大部类以及国民经济各个部门的比例。毛泽东同志从所有这些比例关系中，选出了工业和农业、重工业和轻工业的比例，作为决定整个国民经济发展的比例关系。毛泽东同志在“十大关系”的报告中，曾经把正确处理工业和农业、重工业和轻工业的关系放在了头等重要的位置上。毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中，又进一步把重工业、轻工业和农业的关系问题，作为中国工业化的道路提出来，认为
  “我国的经济建设是以重工业为中心，这一点必须肯定。但是同时必须充分注意发展农业和轻工业。”毛泽东同志这些思想后来概括为“在优先发展重工业的条件下，发展工业和发展农业同时并举，发展重工业和发展轻工业同时并举”的方针，包括在党的建设社会主义总路线的基本点当中。
    工业和农业是社会生产的两个基本部门，它们是互相结合、互为条件、互相促进的，农业是工业发展的基础。农业在国民经济发展当中的重大意义，不仅因为重工业和轻工业的发展，必须同农业交换消费品和生产资料；而且因为只有农业发展了，才能提供更多的资金和劳动力，加快工业和整个国民经济的发展速度。马克思曾经说过：“社会用来生产小麦和牲畜等等所需要的时间愈少，用来进行其他的生产——物质和精神的生产的时间就愈多。”这个道理对于社会主义建设也是完全适用的。毛泽东同志从理论上实践上解决了社会主义建设过程中重工业、轻工业和农业的关系问题，就为我们找到了完全正确的在我国实现社会主义工业化的道路；找到了既能高速度，又能按比例发展国民经济的途径；找到了进一步巩固工农联盟，调动五亿农民建设社会主义积极性的正确方针。1958年和1959年国民经济连续大跃进的实践证明，这是一条完全正确的道路。
    毛泽东同志不仅正确地解决了工业和农业、重工业和轻工业的关系，而且正确地解决了工农业生产发展过程中，中央工业和地方工业、大型企业和中小型企业、洋法生产和土法生产的关系，提出了一整套“两条腿走路”的方针。在比例关系的安排上，则提出了工业要“以钢为纲”，农业要“以粮为纲”，重点带一般，纲举目张，全面跃进的方针。实践证明，这些方针都是完全正确的。有了这些方针作指导，就可以充分地调动起六亿五千万人的建设社会主义的积极性，恰当地安排国民经济的比例关系，保证国民经济持续跃进。
    毛泽东同志还批判了那种消极平衡论的形而上学的观点，明确指出：在社会主义再生产过程中，平衡是相对的，不平衡则是绝对的，“所谓平衡，就是矛盾的暂时的相对的统一。”因此，在社会主义扩大再生产过程中，出现不平衡没有什么可怕，相反的，应当看做是好事。只要我们采取积极平衡的方法，而不是采取消极平衡的方法，就可以促进落后部门赶上先进部门，建立新的平衡，使整个国民经济以跃进的速度向前发展。
    毛泽东同志阐明了社会主义经济中平衡和不平衡的关系，并不是主张越不平衡越好，相反地他十分注意国民经济的综合平衡，在计划工作中要求做到冲天干劲和科学分析相结合，持续跃进和留有余地相结合，长期规划和短期计划相结合，树立“全国一盘棋”的思想。国民经济计划是上层建筑，它能不能更好地符合客观经济过程的发展，和人们的思想状况关系极大。我们必须用毛泽东同志的计划思想武装自己的头脑，以便使我们的计划工作更符合客观经济的发展，既积极又可靠，保证国民经济高速度、按比例地发展。
      正确处理客观可能性和主观能动性之间的关系
    在解决社会主义建设速度问题上，毛泽东同志是注意客观条件的。他曾经告诉我们：“任何人不可以无根据地胡思乱想，不可以超越客观情况所许可的条件去计划自己的行动，不要勉强去做那些实在做不到的事情。”但是，毛泽东同志和那些“唯条件论”者根本不同，他不是把条件固定化，使人们在条件面前感到无能为力，相反的，认为条件只是事情的可能性，把可能性变为现实性，进一步改变条件，决定的东西是人们的自觉的能动作用。毛泽东同志在“论持久战”一书里曾经这样写道：“一切事情是要人做的，持久战和最后胜利没有人做就不会出现。做就必须先有人根据客观事实，引出思想、道理、意见，提出计划、方针、政策、战略、战术，方能做得好。思想等等是主观的东西，做或行动是主观见之于客观的东西，都是人类特殊的能动性。这种能动性，我们名之曰‘自觉的能动性’，是人之所以区别于物的特点。一切根据和符合于客观事实的思想是正确的思想，一切根据于正确思想的做或行动是正确的行动。我们必须发扬这样的思想和行动，必须发扬这种自觉的能动性。”这些道理完全适用于社会主义建设。
    在社会主义建设过程中，人的自觉的能动性主要表现在两方面：一方面，由于有马克思列宁主义所武装的共产党的领导，有了无产阶级专政的政权，人们能够认识客观经济过程发展的规律性，制定出符合客观实际的路线、方针、政策、计划；另一方面，人们把路线、方针、政策、计划见诸于行动，使千百万人的意志集中起来，就汇聚成为一股无坚不摧的巨大力量，这股力量可以翻天复地，创造出一个新的世界。
    有些人认为，我们强调主观能动性，好像可以忽视客观规律性。这是一种误解。其实毛泽东同志所说的自觉的能动性本身，就包含对于客观规律的认识。
    重视人的自觉的能动性，这是毛泽东同志的高速度建设社会主义思想的中心一环。1958年4月毛泽东同志就曾经说过：“除了党的领导之外，六亿人口是一个决定的因素。人多议论多、热气高、干劲大。”这是彻底的辩证唯物论的论断。在整个人类历史发展过程中，作为劳动者和生产工具的创造者、使用者的人，是生产力的决定的因素。但是，在阶级社会，劳动者是被剥削和被压迫的，他们的聪明才智劳动热情曾经长期的受到压抑。经过革命，他们的无穷无尽的智慧和力量，才东风解冻，第一次有可能充分的发挥出来。在这种情况下，只要我们相信群众，依靠群众，贯彻运用群众路线的方法，调动起群众的积极性，人民群众的伟大创造力量，就会以雷霆万钧之势，创造出惊天动地的奇迹来。
    1958年和1959年大跃进的经验证明，革命的群众运动是贯彻总路线的根本保证。离开伟大的群众力量，鼓足干劲，力争上游，只能是空谈；没有既轰轰烈烈又踏踏实实的群众运动，多快好省地建设社会主义，也无从实现。因此，坚持总路线、大跃进和人民公社，头一条就要坚持革命的群众运动。
    解放了的我国六亿五千万人民所具有迅速地改变我国贫穷和落后面貌的强烈愿望，是国民经济高速度发展的决定因素。而毛泽东同志关于高速度建设社会主义的思想，正是亿万人民这种迫切愿望的集中表现。让我们更好地学习毛泽东同志这些思想，在毛泽东思想的指导下，持续地、高速度地发展我国的社会主义建设事业。
