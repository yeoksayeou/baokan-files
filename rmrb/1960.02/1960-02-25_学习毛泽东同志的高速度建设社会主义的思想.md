Studying Comrade Mao Zedong's Thought on Building Socialism at High Speed
Su Xing

The issue of speed is the most important issue in our socialist construction. Developing the national economy at a leaping speed is the soul of the general line for building socialism.

The possibility of high-speed development in China's construction cause was fully estimated by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong on the eve of the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution. In March 1949, the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party pointed out: "The speed of China's economic construction will not be very slow, but may be quite fast, and China's prosperity can be achieved in the near future." In the winter of 1955, when the socialist revolution of the ownership of the means of production in our country was about to be completed, Comrade Mao Zedong further pointed out: "In the future, there will be all kinds of undertakings that people have never imagined, several times, ten times, or even dozens of times the current high yields of crops. The development of industry, transportation, and exchange will be even more unimaginable to predecessors. The same is true for science, culture, education, health and other undertakings.‚Äù The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong not only scientifically predicted the possibility of high-speed development of socialist construction in our country, but also summarized and generalized China's construction experience in 1958, formulated the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and a whole set of construction policies of "walking on two legs," and found a road suitable for China's specific conditions for carrying out socialist construction at high speed. The practice of continuous great leaps forward in 1958 and 1959 proved that China's socialist construction has entered a new stage, that is, the stage of sustained leap forward of the national economy at a higher speed than during the first five-year plan. This is a great victory for Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on building socialism at high speed.

The thought of building socialism at high speed is an important part of Comrade Mao Zedong's economic thought. Comrade Mao Zedong creatively applied the principles of materialist dialectics, profoundly revealed the relationship between production relations and productive forces, superstructure and base, speed and proportion, objective possibility and subjective initiative in the process of socialist economic development, and found the factors that determine the high-speed development of socialist construction. The following is a personal understanding of this issue.
  Correctly handle the relationship between production relations and productive forces

The contradiction between production relations and productive forces is the fundamental driving force for the development and change of all social forms. The development of productive forces is the prerequisite for the change of production relations. Conversely, the change of production relations will promote the rapid development of productive forces. This basic principle of Marxism-Leninism also applies to socialist and communist societies.

There was once an idea that it seems that in socialist society, production relations and productive forces are completely adapted and there are no contradictions. This idea is incorrect. According to the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, Comrade Mao Zedong criticized this view and clearly pointed out: "In socialist society, the basic contradiction remains the contradiction between production relations and productive forces, and the contradiction between superstructure and economic base. However, these contradictions in socialist society have fundamentally different nature and circumstances from the contradictions between production relations and productive forces and the contradictions between superstructure and economic base in the old society." Comrade Mao Zedong did not deny that the socialist production relations have a side suitable for the development of productive forces; however, he saw deeper and further, and saw that the development of socialist society is still carried out in the contradiction between production relations and productive forces, and technological changes and corresponding economic relations will continue to occur. Because Comrade Mao Zedong clarified the dialectical relationship between production relations and productive forces under socialism, people's horizons have been broadened and they have found the fundamental driving force for the high-speed development of the national economy. When dealing with the contradiction between production relations and productive forces, people no longer take an evasive attitude, but face this contradiction squarely and improve and adjust it in a timely manner. Experience has proved that timely improvement or adjustment of production relations according to the requirements of the development of productive forces is the basic prerequisite for the continuous leap forward of the national economy. People have seen that the leaping situation of socialist construction in our country in 1956 occurred after the socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production was basically completed. The great leap forward since 1958 is the direct result of realizing the people's commune and adjusting the relationship between people within and between state-owned enterprises during the all-people rectification movement.

In 1956, after the realization of agricultural cooperation, some people believed that collective ownership had been established in the countryside, and there was no need to change the production relations any more, at least it could remain stable for a long period of time. However, Comrade Mao Zedong did not see it that way. As early as the upsurge of the agricultural cooperation movement, Comrade Mao Zedong had already foreseen that with the development of productive forces, the production relations of agricultural producers' cooperatives would inevitably have to be adjusted. Later, in his article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Comrade Mao Zedong further pointed out: "The completely socialist cooperatives still need to continue to solve some individual problems in ownership." The great leap forward in socialist construction in 1958 fully confirmed Comrade Mao Zedong's prediction. Due to the great leap forward in production, the original small-scale advanced cooperatives that only managed agriculture could no longer meet the requirements of developing production. Therefore, large-scale, integrated industrial, agricultural, commercial, educational and military organizations, with comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations and fishery, and the integration of government and commune, appeared everywhere. In the face of the new situation, Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the experience of the masses and pointed out: Our direction should be to gradually and orderly organize industry, agriculture, commerce (exchange), education (culture and education), and military (militia, that is, national armed forces) into a large commune, becoming the basic unit of the combination of workers, peasants, merchants, students and soldiers in the structure of socialist society in our country, and also the basic unit of socialist political power organizations. Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on the people's commune is the theoretical basis for the rapid realization of the people's commune in our country, and is a brilliant example of creatively handling the contradiction between production relations and productive forces under socialism and promoting the high-speed development of the national economy. In 1959, we encountered disasters that had not been seen in decades. The disaster-stricken area accounted for 30% of the total sown area. However, thanks to the superior system of the people's commune, Chinese farmers overcame serious natural disasters, and not only did not reduce production, but also achieved a huge victory with a total agricultural output value increase of 16.7%, a grain output increase of 8%, and a cotton output increase of 14.76% on the basis of the extraordinary bumper harvest in 1958. This is the most powerful proof that the production relations of the people's commune promote the development of productive forces!

Comrade Mao Zedong has always paid attention to adjusting the relationship between people within and between state-owned enterprises. This issue was specifically discussed in the report "On the Ten Major Relationships" and the article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," pointing out that "the mutual relations of production and exchange in various economic sectors are still being gradually established according to socialist principles, and are gradually finding more appropriate forms." In 1957, during the rectification movement, the criticism of bureaucracy and departmentalism brought about tremendous changes in the mutual relations between socialist enterprises. Due to the resolute implementation of the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee, cadres participating in labor, workers directly participating in part of the daily management work, the implementation of the three-in-one combination of cadres, workers and technicians, and the improvement of various aspects of relations caused by the reform of unreasonable rules and regulations, all greatly improved the workers' labor enthusiasm and the sense of responsibility of the working class. Between enterprises, the communist style of cooperation was greatly promoted, sweeping away the remnants of the departmentalist ideology and bourgeois style of the past that used to "pass the buck" to each other. The relationship between top and bottom, left and right has changed in the enterprise, the relationship between people has improved, and the labor enthusiasm of the laborers has been improved, which immediately promoted the development of production and ushered in the situation of the great leap forward in 1958.

Comrade Mao Zedong not only paid attention to the improvement and adjustment of production relations in a timely manner according to the requirements of the development of productive forces, but also was able to seize the opportunity to put forward the task of developing productive forces after the improvement and adjustment of production relations. After the upsurge of agricultural cooperation, he immediately put forward the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) from 1956 to 1967" to the people of the whole country; after the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, he immediately put forward the combat call to catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in terms of steel and other major industrial product outputs in fifteen years, as well as the historical tasks of technological revolution and cultural revolution; after the people's commune, he immediately raised the task of agricultural modernization to the people of the whole country .

The contradiction between productive forces and production relations is developing. In the process of socialist construction and the transition to communism, with the development of productive forces, production relations will continue to be improved and adjusted. We must never only see productive forces and not see production relations, or ignore the changes and adjustments of production relations. Because failure to correctly handle the relationship between the two cannot guarantee the sustained leap forward of the national economy.
  Correctly handle the relationship between superstructure and base

Correctly handling the relationship between the superstructure and the base also has an important role in the high-speed development of the national economy.

Some people once believed that in socialist society, since the superstructure is generated from and adapted to the base, the two are consistent and there should be no contradictions. This view is incorrect. Contrary to this view, Comrade Mao Zedong believed that in socialist society, the contradiction between the superstructure and the base is still the basic contradiction, and we must adjust this contradiction in a timely manner to promote the development of productive forces.

Under socialist conditions, the contradiction between the superstructure and the base is specifically manifested in the following aspects: First, after the socialist transformation in the ownership of the means of production is basically completed, the socialist revolution has not ended, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, "The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, and the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological field are still long-term, tortuous, and sometimes even very fierce.The proletariat must transform the world according to its own world outlook, and the bourgeoisie must also transform the world according to its own world outlook." Therefore, the socialist revolution must not be limited to the economic front, but must also carry out the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. Even if the socialist revolution has won several battles on the political and ideological fronts and achieved a decisive victory, this struggle will continue to rise and fall, rise and fall, sometimes sharply and sometimes slowly, until the political and ideological influence of the bourgeoisie at home and abroad is finally eliminated; Second, in socialist society, the superstructure and the base are basically adapted, but there will still be defects in some aspects of the political system. Although resolving this contradiction does not require changing the fundamental nature of the superstructure, it still needs to be adjusted in a timely manner. Third, along with the development of productive forces and production relations, new contradictions will continue to arise between the superstructure and the economic base, and these contradictions need to be constantly overcome by people. Contradictions are constantly produced and overcome, overcome and then produced. This is a ceaseless, ever-changing dialectical process.

The most vivid example of correctly handling the relationship between the superstructure and the base, thereby promoting the great leap forward of the national economy, is the all-people rectification movement in 1957 and the struggle against the bourgeois rightists.

The rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle were a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. This revolution greatly inspired the enthusiasm and initiative of the people in building socialism, and greatly hit and weakened the reactionary influence of the exploiting classes in the political and ideological fields. On this basis, Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the policy of "giving prominence to politics," strengthened the Party's leadership over economic work and other various tasks, and fundamentally solved the problem of what channels to mainly use to mobilize people's production enthusiasm in socialist society.

According to Marx, socialist society "is a communist society that has just emerged from capitalist society, and therefore still retains the traces of the old society from which it was born in all aspects, namely in the economic, moral and intellectual aspects." In such a stage, it is necessary to implement distribution according to work and take care of the individual material interests of laborers, which is also beneficial to the development of production. However, this principle of distribution still bears the traces of the old society. Relying on it alone cannot enable people to correctly understand the relationship between collective and long-term interests and individual and current interests, nor can it fully mobilize the enthusiasm of laborers. On the contrary, one-sided emphasis on material incentives will also foster economistic ideas such as "putting money in command," "paying according to labor," and "nitpicking," and corrode the revolutionary will of the working class and the working people. Comrade Mao Zedong's "giving prominence to politics" fundamentally solved the relationship between politics and economy, communist education and concern for the material interests of laborers, and raising collective material interests and raising individual material interests under socialist conditions, and found the decisive factor in encouraging the enthusiasm of laborers: giving prominence to politics first, and material incentives can only be second.

After the rectification movement, Comrade Mao Zedong also put forward the slogan "Break superstitions, emancipate the mind, and carry forward the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act" to the people of the whole country, encouraging people to dare to break superstitions, innovate and create, adhere to the truth, and charge for the truth. Under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought, the spiritual outlook of the Chinese people underwent a very great change in 1958. The oppressed's mark of superstition, fear, and inferiority complex left in people's spiritual state under the oppression of foreign aggressors for more than a hundred years was swept away, and everyone was full of fighting spirit and high spirits. This was an important factor in 1958's great leap forward.

Experience has proved that as long as we can correctly handle the relationship between the superstructure and the base, the sustained leap forward of the national economy will have an important guarantee.
  Correctly handle the relationship between the development speed and proportion of the national economy

High-speed and proportional development of the national economy is a characteristic of the socialist economy. However, in the past, people often regarded proportional relations as rigid and fixed things, and even opposed the two.

Starting from the point of view of dialectical materialism and from the practice of socialist construction in our country, Comrade Mao Zedong not only demonstrated the possibility of high-speed development of the socialist economy and the specific ways to turn possibility into reality; but also further clarified the law of proportional development of the national economy and the policy of correctly handling the relationship between speed and proportion. This includes: a whole set of policies of "walking on two legs"; the arrangement of basic proportional relations in the national economy; the arrangement of key points and general points in proportional relations; balance and imbalance, positive balance and negative balance; the combination of soaring enthusiasm and scientific analysis in planning methods, the combination of continuous leap forward and leaving room for maneuver, the combination of long-term planning and short-term planning, and the idea of "the whole country as one chessboard," and so on. Comrade Mao Zedong's thoughts, both theoretically and practically, raised the theory that the national economy should develop at high speed and in proportion to a new and higher stage.

The proportion in the development process of the national economy refers to the proportion of the two major categories of social production and various departments of the national economy in the process of socialist reproduction. From all these proportional relations, Comrade Mao Zedong selected the proportion of industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry as the proportional relations that determine the development of the entire national economy. In the report "On the Ten Major Relationships," Comrade Mao Zedong placed the correct handling of the relationship between industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry in the most important position. In "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Comrade Mao Zedong further regarded the relationship between heavy industry, light industry and agriculture as the path to China's industrialization, believing that

"Our country's economic construction is centered on heavy industry, and this must be affirmed. However, at the same time, we must pay full attention to the development of agriculture and light industry." Comrade Mao Zedong's thoughts were later summarized as the policy of "developing industry and agriculture simultaneously and developing heavy industry and light industry simultaneously under the conditions of giving priority to the development of heavy industry," which is included in the basic points of the Party's general line for building socialism.

Industry and agriculture are two basic departments of social production. They are combined with each other, conditional on each other, and promote each other. Agriculture is the basis for industrial development. The great significance of agriculture in the development of the national economy is not only because the development of heavy industry and light industry must exchange consumer goods and means of production with agriculture; but also because only when agriculture is developed can it provide more funds and labor force to accelerate the development of industry and the entire national economy. Marx once said: "The less time society needs to produce wheat and livestock, etc., the more time it has to carry out other production - material and spiritual production." This principle is also completely applicable to socialist construction. Comrade Mao Zedong theoretically and practically solved the relationship between heavy industry, light industry and agriculture in the process of socialist construction, and found a completely correct path for us to realize socialist industrialization in our country; found a way to develop the national economy at both high speed and in proportion; and found a correct policy to further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and mobilize the enthusiasm of 500 million farmers to build socialism. The practice of the continuous great leap forward of the national economy in 1958 and 1959 proves that this is a completely correct path.

Comrade Mao Zedong not only correctly solved the relationship between industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry, but also correctly solved the relationship between central industry and local industry, large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, foreign-style production and indigenous production in the development of industrial and agricultural production, and put forward a whole set of policies of "walking on two legs." In the arrangement of proportional relations, he put forward the policy of "taking steel as the key link" in industry and "taking grain as the key link" in agriculture, with the key points leading the general points, promoting all-round leap forward. Practice has proved that these policies are completely correct. With these policies as guidance, we can fully mobilize the enthusiasm of 650 million people to build socialism, appropriately arrange the proportional relations of the national economy, and ensure the sustained leap forward of the national economy.

Comrade Mao Zedong also criticized the metaphysical view of passive equilibrium, and clearly pointed out that in the process of socialist reproduction, equilibrium is relative, and imbalance is absolute. "The so-called equilibrium is the temporary and relative unity of contradictions." Therefore, in the process of socialist expanded reproduction, there is nothing terrible about imbalance. On the contrary, it should be regarded as a good thing. As long as we adopt the method of positive equilibrium instead of the method of negative equilibrium, we can promote backward departments to catch up with advanced departments, establish new equilibrium, and make the entire national economy move forward at a leaping speed.

Comrade Mao Zedong clarified the relationship between equilibrium and imbalance in the socialist economy, but he did not advocate that the more imbalance the better. On the contrary, he paid great attention to the comprehensive balance of the national economy. In planning work, he required the combination of soaring enthusiasm and scientific analysis, the combination of continuous leap forward and leaving room for maneuver, the combination of long-term planning and short-term planning, and the establishment of the idea of "the whole country as one chessboard." The national economic plan is the superstructure, and whether it can better conform to the development of the objective economic process is closely related to people's thinking. We must arm our minds with Comrade Mao Zedong's planning thought, so that our planning work is more in line with the development of the objective economy, both active and reliable, and ensures the high-speed and proportional development of the national economy.
  Correctly handle the relationship between objective possibility and subjective initiative

On the issue of solving the speed of socialist construction, Comrade Mao Zedong paid attention to objective conditions. He once told us: "No one can think wildly without basis, or plan his actions beyond the conditions permitted by objective circumstances, and do not force yourself to do things that are really impossible." However, Comrade Mao Zedong is fundamentally different from those who advocate "conditionalism." He does not fix the conditions, making people feel powerless in the face of conditions. On the contrary, he believes that conditions are only the possibility of things, and what determines the possibility to become reality and further change the conditions is people's conscious dynamic role. Comrade Mao Zedong wrote in "On Protracted War": "Everything has to be done by people, and protracted war and final victory will not appear without people doing it. To do it, someone must first draw ideas, principles, opinions, plans, guidelines, policies, strategies, and tactics based on objective facts in order to do it well. Thoughts and so on are subjective things, and doing or acting is subjective things seen in objective things. They are all the special dynamic roles of human beings. We call this dynamic role 'conscious dynamic role,' which is the characteristic that distinguishes people from things. All thoughts based on and conforming to objective facts are correct thoughts, and all doing or actions based on correct thoughts are correct actions. We must carry forward such thoughts and actions, and we must carry forward this conscious dynamic role." These principles are fully applicable to socialist construction.

In the process of socialist construction, people's conscious dynamic role is mainly manifested in two aspects: on the one hand, due to the leadership of the Communist Party armed with Marxism-Leninism and the existence of the proletarian dictatorship, people can understand the laws of development of the objective economic process and formulate lines, principles, policies, and plans that conform to objective reality; on the other hand, people put the lines, principles, policies, and plans into action, so that the will of millions of people is concentrated, and it becomes a huge and invincible force. This force can turn the world upside down and create a new world.

Some people think that our emphasis on subjective initiative seems to ignore objective laws. This is a misunderstanding. In fact, the conscious dynamic role that Comrade Mao Zedong talked about itself includes the understanding of objective laws.

Paying attention to people's conscious dynamic role is the central link of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on building socialism at high speed. In April 1958, Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "In addition to the leadership of the Party, 600 million people are a decisive factor. More people have more discussions, higher enthusiasm, and greater drive." This is a thorough dialectical materialist conclusion. In the entire process of human history, people, as laborers and creators and users of production tools, are the decisive factors of productive forces. However, in class society, laborers are exploited and oppressed, and their intelligence and labor enthusiasm have been suppressed for a long time. After the revolution, their infinite wisdom and power were unfrozen by the spring breeze, and for the first time it became possible to fullyÂèëÊå•them. In this case, as long as we believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and implement the method of the mass line to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, the great creative power of the people will create earth-shattering miracles with the force of thunder.

The experience of the great leap forward in 1958 and 1959 proves that the revolutionary mass movement is the fundamental guarantee for implementing the general line. Without the great mass strength, it is just empty talk to go all out and aim high; without a mass movement that is both vigorous and down-to-earth, it is impossible to build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Therefore, to adhere to the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune, the first thing is to adhere to the revolutionary mass movement.

The strong desire of the liberated 650 million people in our country to rapidly change the poor and backward face of our country is the determining factor for the high-speed development of the national economy. Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on building socialism at high speed is the concentrated expression of this urgent desire of hundreds of millions of people. Let us better study Comrade Mao Zedong's thoughts and, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, continuously and at high speed develop the socialist construction cause of our country.
