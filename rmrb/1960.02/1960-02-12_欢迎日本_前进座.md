With unparalleled excitement, we Chinese drama workers welcome the Japanese "Zenshinza" troupe to visit and perform in our country. I believe this will further enhance the friendship and cultural exchange between the people of our two countries. Especially today, when enemies are trying to undermine the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people, it is of even greater significance that we have the opportunity to welcome the outstanding cultural envoys of the Japanese people.

For thirty years, all the dramatists of "Zenshinza" have been fighting in difficult circumstances to reform national drama and strive for national progress and international peace. They have been welcomed by a wide range of Japanese audiences, especially workers, peasants, and young students. They bear the mission of serving the audience with new and progressive national dramas. In addition to staging excellent traditional Kabuki plays and progressive dramas, they have also performed foreign masterpieces, such as our comrade Guo Moruo's "Qu Yuan."

In the summer of 1956, I participated in the Chinese Peking Opera delegation's tour of Japan. At the Osaka Kabuki-za, I saw several plays by "Zenshinza." The collectivist spirit expressed in "Mukashi-banashi Nijūniya-machi" starring the troupe leader Chōjūrō Kawarasaki, and "Shunkan" starring the deputy troupe leader Kanyaemon Nakamura, as well as their profound acting skills, allowed us, colleagues who did not understand Japanese, to see the inner activities and character characteristics of each character from their superb performances. Their skill is excellent, their attitude towards art is serious, and the characters they create are vivid, lifelike, and moving. From the actors, we not only saw the "play" but also saw the "people" – determined, unyielding Japanese!

This time, "Zenshinza" has brought many wonderful plays, such as "Kanjinchō," "Shunkan," "Narukami," and "Sakura Sōgorō," all of which are excellent plays that have been refined through countless trials. The capital's audience will be able to see the performances of "Zenshinza" in the bright spring season, which will be the greatest artistic enjoyment. For our colleagues in the drama world, it is not only an opportunity to appreciate their excellent art but also a valuable learning opportunity. Not long ago, the China Youth Art Theatre in Beijing performed the famous Japanese play "Island," and "Shunkan" has also been translated into Chinese scripts, which shows that the cultural exchange between the Chinese and Japanese people is becoming increasingly close.

During my three visits to Japan, I had seen most of the wonderful programs of "Zenshinza," but I still want to see them again. There is an old Chinese poem, "A good book is never tiresome to read a hundred times." I would like to change it to "A good play is never tiresome to watch a hundred times" and give it to them, which is very appropriate.

Finally, I wish all the dramatists of "Zenshinza" good health during their long journey! And I wish their performances a complete success!

### 欢迎日本“前进座”

    欢迎日本“前进座”
    梅兰芳
    我们中国的戏剧工作者以无比兴奋的心情，迎接日本“前进座”到我国来访问演出。我相信，这将进一步增进两国人民之间的友谊和文化交流。特别是在敌人力图破坏中日人民的友好关系的今天，我们能有机会欢迎日本人民优秀的文化使者，就有着更为重要的意义。
    三十年来，“前进座”的全体戏剧家在艰苦的环境中，为了改革民族戏剧，争取民族进步和国际和平所进行的斗争，受到广大的日本观众、特别是工农群众和青年学生的欢迎。他们担负着以新的、进步的民族戏剧为观众服务的使命，他们除了上演歌舞伎的优良传统剧目以及进步话剧等外，还演出过外国的名剧，例如演过我国郭沫若同志的“屈原”。
    1956年的夏天，我参加中国访日京剧代表团到日本巡回演出，在大阪歌舞伎座看到了“前进座”的几个戏，座长河原崎长十郎主演的“昔话二十二夜待”，副座长中村翫右卫门主演的“俊宽”等剧所表现的集体主义精神和他们的深刻的演技，使我们这些不懂日本话的同行，都能够从他们的精湛的表演中看出每个剧中人的内心活动和性格特点。他们的工夫是到家的，对待艺术的态度是严肃的，塑造的人物形象是鲜明生动、有血有肉、令人感动的。从演员们身上，我们不但看到了“戏”，还看到了“人”——坚定的、有骨气的日本人！
    这次“前进座”带来不少精采的剧目，如“劝进帐”、“俊宽”、“鸣神”、“佐仓宗五郎”等剧，都是经过千锤百炼的好戏。首都观众在春光明媚的季节里，能看到“前进座”的演出，将是最大的艺术享受。而对我们戏剧界的同行来说，不仅能欣赏他们优秀的艺术，还是一个可贵的学习机会。不久以前，北京中国青年艺术剧院曾演出日本名剧“岛”，“俊宽”也已译成中文剧本，这说明了中日两国人民之间的文化交流越来越密切了。
    在我三度访日时，“前进座”大部分的精采节目我都已看过，但我还要再看。中国有句旧诗“好书不厌百回读”，我想改为“好戏不厌百回看”移赠他们是非常恰当的。
    最后，祝“前进座”全体戏剧家在长途跋涉中身体健康！并祝他们的演出胜利成功！
