Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, February 16th. The Polish Parliament convened here on the 16th. The meeting passed a resolution expressing support for the recent appeal by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to the parliaments and governments of all countries on the issue of disarmament.

    Polish Party and state leaders Gomulka, Zawadzki, and Cyrankiewicz attended the meeting.

    Polish Foreign Minister Rapacki delivered a report at the meeting on the international situation and Polish foreign policy.

    He said that in recent years, factors of peaceful coexistence have been growing in the development of the international situation and have surpassed the factors of the "Cold War." The growth of socialist forces throughout the world, especially the development of the world socialist system, plays a decisive role in this regard.

    Speaking of Poland's foreign policy, he said that Poland, like the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, has strived and continues to strive to make greater contributions to peaceful coexistence.

    He said that our friendly, cooperative, and mutually supportive relations with the Soviet Union and all other socialist countries have been further strengthened. Our relations with the Soviet Union have never been as good as they are today.

    Speaking of the German question, Rapacki said that this question is a major historical issue related to Poland's security. It is an extremely important issue for European peace and a key issue in Poland's foreign policy. The German Democratic Republic has drawn conclusions from history. West Germany, however, has not drawn conclusions from history and has once again embarked on the path that has ended in war and German defeat twice in the last fifty years.

    Rapacki pointed out that West German extremist imperialists must also be well aware that their "eastward advance" objectives are by no means realistic. He said that it can be stated quite openly that Poland's borders are sufficiently defensible.

    Rapacki finally expressed support for the Soviet proposal for complete and thorough disarmament.

    After discussion, the meeting passed a resolution of complete confidence in the Polish government's foreign policy.

    The meeting passed a resolution on the appeal of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, welcoming the Soviet decision to further reduce the Soviet armed forces.

    The resolution said that this decision once again demonstrates to the world the consistently peaceful nature of Soviet policy, and the Soviet Union's actions have been supported by people all over the world.

    The resolution said, however, that the people of all countries must be vigilant against the schemes of forces hostile to the cause of peace, which, on the eve of important international negotiations on the issue of disarmament, are doing everything possible to pursue a policy of fait accompli in the military sphere, especially in arming West Germany with atomic weapons.

    The Polish Parliament once again expressed its protest against the imperialist forces arming West Germany. The resolution pointed out that in this situation, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the resolution of the West Berlin issue have become even more urgent.

    波兰议会通过决议
    支持苏联的裁军呼吁
    新华社华沙16日电　波兰议会16日在这里开会。会议通过一项决议，表示支持苏联最高苏维埃最近就裁军问题致世界各国议会和政府的呼吁书。
    波兰党和国家的领导人哥穆尔卡、萨瓦茨基和西伦凯维兹参加了会议。
    波兰外交部长腊帕茨基在会上作了关于国际形势和波兰外交政策的报告。
    他说，近年来在国际局势的发展中，和平共处的因素已在增长，并且超过了“冷战”的因素。全世界社会主义力量的增长，首先是世界社会主义体系的发展，在这方面起着决定性的作用。
    在谈到波兰的外交政策时，他说，同苏联和其他社会主义国家一样，波兰曾经努力、而且仍在努力对和平共处作出更大的贡献。
    他说，我们同苏联和所有其他社会主义国家的友好、合作和互助关系更加加强了。我们同苏联的关系从来没有像今天这样好。
    在谈到德国问题时，腊帕茨基说，这个问题是关系到波兰安全的主要的历史问题。这是欧洲和平的极重要的问题，是波兰对外政策的关键性问题。德意志民主共和国从历史中做出了结论。而西德没有从历史中做出结论，并且又走上了近五十年来两次以战争和德国的失败而结束的道路。
    腊帕茨基指出，西德极端帝国主义分子想必也十分清楚，他们的“东进”目的是绝非现实的。他说，可以完全公开地说，对波兰的边界是有足够的防御力的。
    腊帕茨基最后表示支持苏联提出的全面彻底裁军的建议。
    会议经过讨论后，通过了一项完全信任波兰政府的外交政策的决议。
    会议就苏联最高苏维埃的呼吁书通过决议，表示欢迎苏联关于再次裁减苏联武装部队的决定。
    决议说，这一决定再次向全世界表明了苏联政策始终一贯的和平性质，苏联的行动受到了全世界人民的支持。
    决议说，但是，各国人民必须对仇视和平事业的势力的诡计提高警惕，它们在裁军问题的重要国际谈判的前夕，在军事方面千方百计地推行既成事实的政策，特别是用原子武器武装西德。
    波兰议会再次表示抗议武装西德的帝国主义势力。决议指出，在这种情况下，缔结对德和约和解决西柏林问题，就成了更加刻不容缓的事了。
