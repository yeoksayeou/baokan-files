    Spring Fills the World
    Liufeng
    We have just celebrated the Spring Festival and are welcoming the arrival of spring. In most people's minds, winter's departure and spring's arrival seem to be just a cycle that repeats itself. In fact, nothing in nature does not develop and change. The same is true of spring; this year's spring is different from last year's.
    If you don't believe me, look at the Xinhua News Agency report of December 26th last year: Soviet scientists have determined that the Arctic is warming up in the last half-century, and the area of permafrost has shrunk. Coincidentally, the People's Daily reported on February 1st this year that the ice in Antarctica is also melting. In the past fifty years, the sea level of the world's oceans has risen by six centimeters, which is related to the melting of the Antarctic ice.
    On Earth, there are not only cyclical climate changes of the four seasons, but also long-term climate changes: sometimes it gets colder, which is when the so-called "ice age" arrives; sometimes it gets warmer, like the period we are in now.
    Hundreds of thousands of years ago, the Earth was much colder than it is now. At that time, places like Moscow, Warsaw, and Berlin were frozen with ice and snow all year round, just like Antarctica today. The Earth's glacier area reached about 50 million square kilometers, with ice layers more than 1,000 meters thick. Many high mountains in southern China were also covered with glaciers.
    Now, after evolution, the Earth's glacier area has shrunk to only about 16 million square kilometers, and more than 90% of it is distributed in the polar regions. Among them, the Antarctic glacier area accounts for about 14 million square kilometers. In other regions of the Earth, glaciers only exist on very high mountains.
    Therefore, overall, the Earth's climate is gradually warming, especially significantly in recent years. As early as the 18th century, people noticed that the Seine River, which flows through Paris, used to freeze every year, but this was no longer the case in the 18th century. Animals from cold regions, such as elk, lynx, and bears, originally produced in France and Germany, have since retreated north. According to recent observations, between 1910 and 1940, the average temperature in January on Earth rose by about 0.6 degrees Celsius, and in some places, it rose even more.
    Many people have given different explanations for the phenomenon of rising temperatures on Earth. Some people believe that the sun's radiation has strengthened, and the Earth has received more heat. Indeed, this is possible. In recent years, there have been many solar flares equivalent to the explosion of tens of thousands of hydrogen bombs and a large number of sunspots, which are all signs of increased solar activity. Due to the increased solar activity, the heat received by the Earth has increased.
    Some people also believe that the heat on Earth has not increased, but is distributed more evenly. This is also possible. According to observations of the Kara Sea, it was found that the heat it receives each year from the Atlantic warm current is more than the heat directly from solar radiation, and the flow of warm air from the tropics to the poles also plays the same role.
    It seems that both factors are worth considering. There are many complex factors affecting climate change, so although the Earth's temperature is generally warming, it is not a straight line upward. Today, what is particularly noteworthy and increasingly important is the role of humans:
    Every year, mankind burns billions of tons of fuel, producing a large amount of carbon dioxide. The increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can absorb more heat. Our planting trees, building reservoirs, and melting alpine ice and snow can also increase the Earth's heat absorption capacity, because ice and snow will reflect 80%-100% of the heat radiated by the sun; bare land will also reflect 10%-20%, but on ground covered with vegetation, only 4%-15% of the heat is reflected, and even less on the water surface, only about 3%. The progressive scholar Buffon in the eighteenth century once wrote: "Man, manipulating the general cause and changing the temperature, can simultaneously eliminate what is harmful to him and transform everything that is beneficial to him." Yes, we are increasingly able to improve the climate. Last December, TASS reported that Soviet scientists proposed a plan to build a dam between Sakhalin Island and the Asian continent. This dam can block the southward flow of cold currents while still allowing warm currents to flow northward, thereby warming northern China, eastern Soviet Union, and Hokkaido in Japan. In the future, more and better plans to improve the climate will continue to be proposed and realized, and the Antarctic continent, which is as large as Europe and Australia combined, will also become a paradise for mankind. In the face of the passing of spring, the ancients could only sigh "flowing water and falling flowers, spring is gone," but in our era where the east wind prevails over the west wind, the east wind will truly blow across the earth, and spring will remain in the world forever!

    春满人间
    柳风
    我们刚刚欢度了春节，正在迎接春天的来临。在一般人的感觉中，冬去春来似乎仅仅是一种周而复始的循环。其实在自然界中没有任何一种事物不在发展变化。春天也是如此，今年的春天就和去年的春天不同。
    你若不信，请看去年12月26日的新华社消息：苏联科学家确定近半世纪以来北极正在转暖，永久冰冻层的面积已经缩小了。无独有偶，今年2月1日人民日报报道：南极的冰块也在融化，近五十年来，世界海洋的水平面已提高了六厘米，这与南极冰块融化有关。
    在地球上，不仅有着一年四季周期性的气候变迁，而且有着长期的气候变化：时而变冷，那是所谓“冰期”到来的时候；时而转暖，就像我们现在所处的时期。
    数十万年以前，地球上要比现在冷得多，那时像莫斯科、华沙、柏林这些地方都像今天的南极一样终年为冰雪所封冻。地球上冰川面积达到五千万平方公里左右，冰层厚一千米以上，我国南方许多高山上也悬挂着冰川。
    现在，经过演变后，地球上冰川的面积已缩小到只有一千六百万平方公里左右，而且百分之九十几分布在两极地区。其中南极的冰川面积就占有约一千四百万平方公里，在地球上其他地区，仅仅在很高的山上才有冰川了。
    因此，总的看来，地球上的气候是在逐渐变暖，特别是最近若干年来比较显著。早在十八世纪，人们就注意到从前流过巴黎的塞纳河每年都要结冰，可是十八世纪时就不是这样了。在法国、德国一带本来出产麋、大山猫、熊等寒冷地区的动物，可是后来都退到北方去了。据最近的观测，在1910年到1940年间，地球上1月份的平均气温大约升高了0．6度，在某些地方还升高得更多。
    对于地球上温度升高这种现象，许多人作了不同的解释，有的人认为是太阳的辐射加强了，地球得到了更多的热。的确，这是有可能的。最近这些年来，太阳上曾出现了多次相当若干万颗氢弹爆炸的耀斑爆发和出现了大量黑子，这些都是太阳活动加强的现象。由于太阳活动的加强，使地球上得到的热增加了。
    也有人认为地球上的热并没有增加，而是分布得均匀些了。这也是有可能的，根据对喀拉海的观测，发现这个海每年获得的热量中，来自大西洋暖流的热量竟多于直接来自太阳辐射的热量，而热带上暖空气向两极的流动也起同样的作用。
    看来这两种因素都是值得考虑的。影响气候变化的，还有许多复杂的因素，因此地球上的温度虽然总的说来是在变暖，但也不是直线上升。在今天，特别值得注意而且是愈来愈重要的是人的作用：
    每年，人类燃烧了亿万吨燃料，产生了大量的碳酸气，大气中的碳酸气增加了就能吸收更多的热。我们植树造林修水库和融化高山冰雪也能使地球的吸热能力增加，因为冰雪将使太阳射来的热有80％—100％被反射掉；裸露的陆地也要反射掉10％—20％，但在有植物复盖的地面只有4％—15％的热被反射，在水面上更少到只有3％左右。十八世纪的进步学者布封曾经这样写道：“人，操纵着总因，改变着温度，就可以同时一面消灭于他有害的东西，一面化育一切于他有利的东西。”是的，我们正在愈来愈有力地改善气候。去年12月塔斯社报道：苏联科学家提出了在库页岛与亚洲大陆之间筑坝的方案，利用这座坝可以阻挡寒流南下，但仍能让暖流北上，从而使我国北部、苏联东部以及日本的北海道都变得暖和。未来更多更好的改善气候的方案一定还会不断提出和实现，相当欧洲和澳洲加在一起那样大的南极大陆也将成为人类的乐园。古人面对春天的逝去只能发出“流水落花春去也”的浩叹，而在我们这个东风压倒西风的时代里，却将真正出现东风吹遍大地，春天永留人间！
