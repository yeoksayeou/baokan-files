Xinhua News Agency, February 25th, Tokyo Dispatch: Four million people from all walks of life and over a thousand joint struggle organizations in Japan held rallies, parades, and signature drives across the country today, launching a massive 12th National Unified Action, expressing their determination to prevent the Diet from ratifying the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

    A key characteristic of this national unified action is the close integration of the movement to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" with the Japanese workers' spring struggle. 1.5 million government employees held rallies, parades, and other activities in thirteen cities, including Tokyo, Osaka, and Sapporo, today, kicking off the prelude to the Japanese workers' spring struggle. They expressed opposition to the new "Security Treaty" and demanded higher wages and the protection of workers' legitimate rights.

    This evening, Tokyo hosted a national rally attended by 80,000 people to prevent the new "Security Treaty" and strive for the formulation of a peaceful budget. This is the first national protest rally held by the Japanese people since the Kishi Nobusuke government signed the new "Security Treaty." The rally passed a declaration stating that the new "Security Treaty" would lead to increased military spending, taxes, unemployment, and poverty for Japan. The declaration emphasized taking today's unified action as a starting point to establish a system of general strikes and national protests and to persevere in the struggle.

    Japanese Communist Party representative Yoshio Shiga, Socialist Party Secretary-General Inejiro Asanuma, Sohyo Chairman Kaoru Ota, and Okinawa youth representative Shinkawa all spoke at the rally.

    Shiga pointed out that the new "Security Treaty" is a U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty that will drag Japan into war, and the Japanese people must do everything in their power to prevent the Diet from ratifying it.

    Ota stated that Japanese workers will launch the largest unified action since the establishment of Sohyo in March and April, mobilizing more than half of the Japanese people to join the struggle to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

    The rally concluded with shouts of slogans such as "Smash the U.S.-Japan Security System!" and "Down with the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet!" Afterwards, Inejiro Asanuma led a lantern parade in Tokyo.

    Prior to this, 50,000 government employees held rallies in five locations in Tokyo, demanding higher wages and opposing the Diet's ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

    1,500 small business owners in Tokyo also held a rally against the new "Security Treaty" and demanding tax cuts. Japanese Communist Party Chairman Sanzo Nosaka spoke at the meeting.

    Within Osaka Prefecture, rallies and demonstrations were held in nine locations today. At a rally in Osaka City attended by 25,000 people, resolutions were passed opposing the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" and demanding higher wages.

    In Kyoto Prefecture, the cultural center of Japan, rallies were held in twenty-four locations today, and a demonstration of two thousand people was held in Kyoto City.

    In Kobe City, after holding a rally of 8,000 people against the new "Security Treaty," a demonstration was held in front of the local U.S. Consulate and police station.

    Nagoya held the Aichi Prefecture People's Rally against the new "Security Treaty" today. Thirteen marching columns that departed from various parts of the prefecture on the 21st arrived in Nagoya today, and all members participated in the rally. Kanagawa Prefecture, Mie Prefecture, Wakayama Prefecture, and Kagoshima Prefecture have all begun prefectural marches against the new "Security Treaty." Fukuoka Prefecture, Yamaguchi Prefecture, and other prefectures have also held general mobilization rallies.

    60,000 small business owners across Japan held rallies and bicycle parades in more than 140 locations today. Their slogan is to oppose the new "Security Treaty," the root of approving heavy taxes.

Xinhua News Agency, February 24th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Central Joint Struggle Conference for the Japanese Workers' Spring Struggle held its first plenary meeting today and adopted the current struggle guidelines. 4.5 million workers from 66 unions have decided to participate in the spring struggle.

    According to reports, the workers' spring struggle, centered around the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), will sound the battle drum on February 25th, the day of the 12th National Unified Action against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and will enter the climax of the struggle in late March and early April.

    The Central Joint Struggle Conference decided that while participating in the movement against the new "Security Treaty," Japanese workers will launch struggles to achieve minimum wages, demand shorter working hours, and prevent industrial accidents.

    The conference issued a statement saying that Japanese workers are determined to launch a long-term struggle until final victory is achieved.

    The conference elected Sohyo Vice Chairman Yoshinobu Kadoma and Secretary-General Akira Iwai as the chairman and secretary-general of the Central Joint Struggle Conference, respectively.

    Alarmed by the growing mass movement, the Superintendent General of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, Ken Ogura, deployed measures to suppress the Japanese people's opposition to the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the workers' spring struggle at a meeting of police station chiefs on the 23rd. Ogura told his henchmen that the Japanese workers' spring struggle would combine the struggle to increase wages with the struggle against the new "Security Treaty." The police authorities "absolutely cannot allow any illegal behavior." (Attached picture)
