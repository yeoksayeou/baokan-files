Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 31st. The Kerala State Assembly election in India is about to be held on February 1st. Newspapers here generally believe that this campaign is the most intense in Indian history.

    It is reported that the Indian National Congress, the Praja Socialist Party, and the Muslim League have formed a three-party alliance to compete with the Indian Communist Party and the independent candidates it supports. All senior leaders of these three parties have emphasized in their speeches and propaganda that the upcoming election is not the usual struggle over economic and political issues. The Chairman of the Praja Socialist Party, Mehta, and the General Secretary, Goray, repeatedly stated in Kerala that, in their view, the basic issue of the Kerala election is a resolute and fierce attack on the Communists. However, these three parties have differences of opinion, and they have not been able to issue a joint campaign declaration.

    According to the Press Trust of India, Indian Prime Minister Nehru personally visited Ernakulam, Kerala on the 18th of this month to campaign for the National Congress. He attacked the Indian Communist Party at a mass meeting, saying it was a "very backward party." He said that the Indian Communist Party basically does not represent nationalism, nor does it represent the national spirit of the Indian people. He also accused the Indian Communist Party of suffering a "crisis of conscience" on the Sino-Indian border issue. Nehru also admitted at another meeting that the Kerala National Congress had failed in many ways due to the lack of a truly effective organization. He urged the National Congress to do some solid work in order to compete with the Communists there.

    It is reported that the new chairman of the National Congress, Reddy, and the leaders of the National Congress, Indira Gandhi and Debar, also traveled to various places in the state to campaign for the National Congress. Six central-level ministers lobbied everywhere during their visit to Kerala to win votes for the National Congress.

    The three-party alliance has mobilized a large number of propaganda tools, jeeps, and personnel for the campaign, and it has received the support of the Catholic Church and the Nair Service Society. According to a recent letter published by one of the leaders of the Indian Communist Party and former Chief Minister of Kerala, Nambudiripad, more than a thousand cars have been transported from other places to help the National Congress carry out its campaign activities.

    According to a report in "The Statesman" on the 28th, 5,000 policemen from neighboring states have been transferred to Kerala. Mobile patrol teams are also ready to be dispatched.

    It has already been reported that conflicts have occurred in the election campaign. The Press Trust of India quoted official reports as saying that one person was killed and several injured in Trichur on January 25. According to the "New Age" weekly, the victims were all Communists who participated in peaceful marches supporting Communist candidates.

    Indian Communist leader Ghosh, in a recent issue of the "New Age" weekly, again called on the people of Kerala to elect the Communist Party in order to defend democracy, democratic reform, and serve the people. He pointed out, "The Communist Party predicts in the election campaign that it will solve the problems that its government has always given priority to: implementing the Land Relations Act and other land reform laws, expanding cooperatives, implementing local decentralization in a democratic way, and comprehensively developing Kerala."

    The Indian Communist Party was originally the ruling party in Kerala. In June of last year, the then opposition parties, the National Congress, the Praja Socialist Party, and the Muslim League, and reactionary religious forces incited a movement to overthrow the state government. By July 31, the President of India announced the takeover of the state government. According to the Indian Constitution, the President's takeover can only last for a maximum of six months, during which elections should be held again.

    印度喀拉拉邦大选竞选活动激烈
    高士号召选民支持共产党
    一些共产党人在竞选中竟遭到杀害
    新华社新德里31日电　印度喀拉拉邦议会选举即将在2月1日举行。这里的报纸普遍认为，这次竞选是印度历史上最激烈的一次。
    据报道，印度国大党、人民社会党和穆斯林联盟结成三党联盟，同印度共产党及它所支持的无党派人士进行竞选。这三个党的所有高级领导人在他们的演说和宣传中都曾强调，即将到来的选举并不是在经济和政治问题上的通常斗争。人民社会党主席梅达和总书记戈拉伊在喀拉拉邦一再重复说，在他们看来，喀拉拉邦选举的基本问题是坚决猛攻共产党人。但是，这三个党有着意见分歧，它们没有能够发表联合的竞选宣言。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度总理尼赫鲁曾经亲自在本月18日访问喀拉拉邦的埃纳库拉姆，为国大党进行竞选。他曾在一次群众大会上攻击印度共产党，说它是“非常落后的党”。他说，印度共产党基本上不代表民族主义，也不代表印度人民的民族精神。他还指责说，印度共产党在中印边界问题上遭到“良心的危机”。尼赫鲁还在另一次会议上承认，喀拉拉邦的国大党由于缺乏真正有效的组织，在许多方面都失败了。他敦促国大党做一些踏实的工作以便在那里同共产党人竞争。
    据报道，国大党新主席雷迪和国大党的领袖英迪拉·甘地、德巴也到这个邦的各个地方旅行，为国大党进行竞选。有六名中央级部长在访问喀拉拉邦期间到处游说，为国大党争取选票。
    三党联盟动员了大量的宣传工具、吉普车和人员以进行竞选，它得到天主教会和奈尔服务社的支持。据印度共产党领导人之一、前喀拉拉邦首席部长南布迪里巴德在最近发表的信中指出，有人从外地运入一千多辆汽车来帮助国大党开展竞选活动。
    据“政治家报”28日报道，邻近的别的邦有五千名警察被调到喀拉拉邦去。机动巡逻队也准备出动。
    已经有消息说，在竞选运动中发生了冲突。印度报业托辣斯援引官方的报告说，1月25日在特里丘尔有一人被杀，几人受伤。据“新世纪”周报报道，受害人都是共产党人，他们参加了支持共产党候选人的和平游行。
    印度共产党领袖高士在最近一期“新世纪”周报上再次呼吁喀拉拉邦人民选举共产党，以便捍卫民主、民主改革和为人民服务。他指出，“共产党在竞选运动中预言要解决它的政府一直优先考虑的问题：执行土地关系法和其它土地改革法、扩大合作社、以民主方式实行地方分权，以及全面发展喀拉拉邦。”
    印度共产党原来在喀拉拉邦是执政党。去年6月，当时的反对党国大党、人民社会党和穆斯林联盟和反动教派势力煽起了推翻邦政府的运动。到7月31日，印度总统宣布接管邦政府。根据印度宪法，总统接管最多只能有六个月，在这期间应当重新举行选举。
