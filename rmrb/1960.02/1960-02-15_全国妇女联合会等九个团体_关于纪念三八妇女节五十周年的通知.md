Xinhua News Agency, February 14th: The joint notice from the All-China Women's Federation and eight other organizations regarding the 50th anniversary of the "March 8th" International Working Women's Day is as follows:

This year, March 8th, marks the 50th anniversary of the "March 8th" International Working Women's Day, a great and glorious revolutionary festival. As we warmly celebrate this festival, it is precisely at a time when the people of our country are enthusiastically hailing the great victories of the general line of socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes. Our country has already overfulfilled the 1959 national economic plan and victoriously achieved the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. The people's communes have been further consolidated and improved. The people's socialist consciousness and communist spirit have soared to unprecedented heights, cultural life is thriving, and material life is improving even more.

Under such a favorable situation, in 1958, China's women's movement began to leap forward to a new stage of achieving complete liberation, and in 1959, it achieved another great victory of continued leap forward. Women across the country have extensively participated in industrial and agricultural production and other construction undertakings. The vast majority have become skilled social laborers with a high degree of socialist consciousness and a certain level of cultural and technical skills. They warmly support the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes. In the movement to increase production and practice economy, centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, they are full of energy, enthusiasm, and heroic labor, constantly innovating and creating. Various collective welfare undertakings and social service undertakings, after rectification, development, and construction, have become more consolidated and improved in rural areas and are developing towards universality in cities, thus further realizing the ideal of socializing household labor.

In order to realize a better, more comprehensive, and continued leap forward in 1960, women across the country must, together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, better implement the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and actively participate in the movement to increase production and practice economy centered on technical innovation and technical revolution. Women across the country must all have high aspirations and set great goals, striving to become red, diligent, skillful, and thrifty socialist working women, and make greater contributions to fulfilling and overfulfilling the 1960 national construction plan, and to building socialism at a high speed. To this end:

(1) Women across the country must actively and systematically study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong Thought is a model of the combination of the universal truth of Marxism and the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, and it creatively developed Marxism-Leninism in the practice of the entire Chinese revolution and construction. In the current new stage of socialist construction in our country, striving to study Chairman Mao's works and arming ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought is a common and urgent requirement for all of us, and it is also an extremely important political task at present. Because only in this way can we more deeply understand and better implement the Party's general line for building socialism, continue to achieve the Great Leap Forward, consolidate the people's communes; better transform our thinking, improve our work, and forever advance along the direction pointed out by the Party and Chairman Mao.

(2) Women across the country must continue to actively participate in the movement to increase production and practice economy centered on technical innovation and technical revolution. In industrial and agricultural production, and on all fronts of socialist construction, we must work hard, work practically, and work skillfully, vigorously engage in technical innovation and technical revolution, promote the communist style of seeking truth from facts and daring to think and act, establish the spirit of continuous revolution, boldly innovate and create, and strive to improve labor productivity. We must also pay special attention to studying science and culture to meet the needs of the current technical innovation and technical revolution. All young and middle-aged women who have not yet eliminated illiteracy should eliminate it completely within two or three years, and strive to complete it ahead of schedule, and promptly enter spare-time schools. All women should gradually improve their cultural level and boldly engage in scientific research.

(3) Our women must fully realize that doing a good job in collective living welfare undertakings and social service undertakings is of great significance for further liberating women's labor force, helping women to concentrate on participating in the technical and cultural revolution, promoting the continued leap forward of socialist construction, and consolidating the people's communes; it is a noble cause in socialist construction. At present, we must vigorously develop, consolidate, and run public canteens, and also actively develop and run nurseries, kindergartens, service stations, maternity hospitals, and homes for the elderly. We must not only do a good job in the construction work of existing collective living welfare undertakings and social service undertakings, improve business management, expand the scope of services, and improve the quality of services; at the same time, we must actively develop a variety of welfare organizations and service organizations of different scales, forms, and standards, and strive to meet various needs under various circumstances. Strive to gradually develop from organizing mainly housework to comprehensively organizing life. Women across the country must closely care about and actively support the rapid development and improvement of this cause, and women serving in this cause should wholeheartedly run the collective living welfare undertakings and social service undertakings with great success.

(4) Women across the country must continue to carry forward the fine tradition of hard struggle of the working people of our country, continue to implement the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift, running all undertakings with diligence and thrift, and managing households with diligence and thrift, and take the Marxist principle of subordinating individual interests to overall interests and subordinating immediate interests to long-term interests as a guide for all actions, and fully promote the communist labor attitude of not talking about conditions and not calculating rewards.

Whether in state-owned enterprises, in collective undertakings, or in families, we must be careful and meticulous in our calculations, live a planned life, and pay attention to fully utilizing and developing the potential of material and financial resources at any time and anywhere, turning useless things into useful treasures, promoting the development of production, and promoting the happiness of collective life.

In order to commend advanced women and advanced collectives mainly composed of women who have made outstanding contributions on all fronts of socialist construction in 1959, the All-China Women's Federation has decided to select 10,000 advanced women and advanced collectives from all over the country during the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the "March 8th" International Working Women's Day, and award them with certificates and flags of "March 8th Red Banner Pacesetter" and "March 8th Red Banner Collective" respectively. We firmly believe that through this large-scale commendation and reward activity, women in our country will surely learn more advanced models and advanced experiences, and more advanced collectives and advanced figures will emerge, making more outstanding contributions to realizing the continued leap forward in 1960.

As we warmly celebrate the "March 8th" International Working Women's Day, we should not only care about the destiny of our own country and women, but also care about the destiny of the people and women of the world. The current international situation is that the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind, as Chairman Mao pointed out, "The enemy is rotting away day by day, while we are getting better day by day." The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is developing and strengthening unprecedentedly; the struggles of Asian, African, and Latin American countries for national independence and democracy are growing and strengthening, and the balance of international forces is more favorable to peace and socialism. Due to the unyielding struggle of the powerful world peace forces, the US imperialist "position of strength" policy and "brinkmanship" policy have been repeatedly frustrated. US imperialism is increasingly isolated politically, and with its new weapons lagging behind the Soviet Union, in order to paralyze the fighting spirit of the people of the world, undermine the unity of world peace forces, and buy time to reverse its military decline, it is recently playing two-faced tricks, making some peace gestures on the surface, but in its bones stepping up arms expansion and war preparations, vigorously developing intercontinental missiles, and establishing and expanding missile bases everywhere. It is certain that this conspiracy of the US ruling clique cannot deceive the peace-loving people of the world, but only further proves that the nature of imperialism will not change, and US imperialism is still the main enemy of world peace. Women across the country must maintain full vigilance against this two-faced trick of US imperialism, on the one hand, strive to participate in socialist construction and constantly strengthen our own strength, and at the same time, further strengthen solidarity and friendship with socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, strengthen solidarity and friendship with Asian, African, and Latin American countries in defending democracy and striving for national independence, and strengthen the great unity with all peace-loving women in the world, and jointly strive to defend world peace, safeguard women's rights, and children's happiness.

    全国妇女联合会等九个团体
    关于纪念三八妇女节五十周年的通知
    新华社14日讯　全国妇女联合会等九个团体关于纪念“三八”国际劳动妇女节五十周年的联合通知，文如下：
    今年3月8日，是“三八”国际劳动妇女节五十周年，这是一个伟大而光辉的革命节日。当我们热烈庆祝这一个节日的时候，正是我国人民热烈欢呼社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社获得伟大胜利的时候，我们国家已经超额完成1959年国民经济计划，提前三年胜利实现第二个五年计划的主要指标，人民公社更加巩固提高了，人民的社会主义觉悟和共产主义风格空前高涨，文化生活欣欣向荣，物质生活更加改善。
    在这样大好形势下，1958年我国妇女运动开始跃进到实现彻底解放的新阶段，1959年又取得了继续跃进的伟大胜利。全国妇女广泛地参加了工农业生产和其他各项建设事业，绝大多数已经成为有高度社会主义觉悟，有一定文化技术水平的熟练的社会劳动者。她们热烈地拥护总路线、大跃进和人民公社。在以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动中，干劲冲天，热情奔放，英勇劳动，不断地革新和创造。各种集体福利事业和社会服务事业，经过整顿、发展和建设，在农村已经更加巩固和提高，在城市正朝着普遍化的方向发展，从而使家务劳动社会化的理想，正在更进一步地实现。
    为了实现1960年更好的全面的继续跃进，全国妇女一定要和全国人民一起，在党和毛主席的领导下，更好地贯彻执行鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，积极参加以技术革新、技术革命为中心的增产节约运动。全国妇女一定要人人树雄心，个个立大志，争取成为红、勤、巧、俭的社会主义劳动妇女，为完成和超额完成1960年国家建设计划，为高速度建设社会主义作出更大的贡献。为此：
    （一）全国妇女要积极地有计划地学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东著作。毛泽东思想是马克思主义普遍真理和中国革命具体实践相结合的典范，是在整个中国革命和建设的实践过程中创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义。在当前我国社会主义建设的新阶段，努力学习毛主席的著作，用毛泽东思想武装起来，是我们大家共同的迫切的要求，也是当前的一项极端重要的政治任务。因为只有这样，我们才能更深刻地理解和更好地贯彻执行党的建设社会主义的总路线，继续实现大跃进、巩固人民公社；才能更好地改造思想、改进工作，永远沿着党和毛主席指引的方向前进。
    （二）全国妇女要继续积极参加以技术革新、技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，在工农业生产上，在建设社会主义的各个战线上，要苦干、实干加巧干，大搞技术革新和技术革命，发扬实事求是与敢想敢干的共产主义风格，树立不断革命的精神，大胆革新创造，努力提高劳动生产率。还要特别重视学习科学文化，以适应当前技术革新、技术革命的需要。凡未脱盲的青壮年妇女，要在两三年内全部脱盲，并力争提前完成，及时升入业余学校。所有妇女，都要步步提高文化水平，大胆从事科学研究。
    （三）我们妇女要充分认识办好集体生活福利事业、社会服务事业，对于进一步解放妇女劳动力，帮助妇女专心一意参加技术、文化革命，促进社会主义建设继续跃进，巩固人民公社，都有重大的意义；是社会主义建设中的一项崇高事业。当前我们既要大力发展、巩固和办好公共食堂，也要积极发展和办好托儿所、幼儿园、服务站、妇产院、敬老院。既要搞好现有的集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业中的建设工作，改善经营管理，扩大服务范围，提高服务质量；同时要积极发展多种多样规模不同，形式、标准不一的福利组织和服务组织，尽量满足各种情况下各种不同的需要。努力作到从组织主要的家务劳动逐步发展到全面组织生活。全国妇女必须密切关怀和积极支持这项事业的迅速发展和提高，而在这项事业中服务的妇女，更应全心全意，把集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业办得满堂红。
    （四）全国妇女要继续发挥我国劳动人民艰苦奋斗的优良传统，继续执行勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业、勤俭持家的方针，把个人利益服从整体利益，眼前利益服从长远利益的马克思主义原则作为一切行动指南，充分发扬不讲条件、不计报酬的共产主义劳动态度。
    不论在国家企业里，在集体事业里，在家庭里，都要精打细算，有计划地过好日子，随时随地注意充分运用和发挥物力、财力的潜在力量，把无用之物变成有用之宝，促进生产的发展，促进集体生活的幸福。
    全国妇联为表扬在1959年建设社会主义各个战线上作出卓越贡献的先进妇女和以妇女为主的先进集体，决定在纪念“三八”国际劳动妇女节五十周年的时候，从全国各地选拔一万个先进妇女和先进集体，分别授与“三八红旗手”“三八红旗集体”的奖状和奖旗。我们深信，通过这个大规模的表扬和奖励活动，定将使我国妇女学到更多的先进榜样、先进经验，涌现出更多的先进集体和先进人物，为实现1960年的继续跃进作出更出色的贡献。
    在我们热烈庆祝“三八”国际劳动妇女节的时候，我们不仅要关心自己国家和妇女的命运，而且也要关心世界人民和妇女的命运。现在国际形势是东风继续压倒西风，正如毛主席所指出的“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来。”以苏联为首的社会主义阵营空前发展和强大；亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国争取民族独立，争取民主的斗争日益发展壮大，国际上的力量对比更加有利于和平和社会主义。由于强大的世界和平力量进行了不屈不挠的斗争，美帝国主义的“实力地位”政策和“战争边缘”政策已一再遭到挫败。美帝国主义在政治上日益孤立，新武器落后于苏联的情况下，为了麻痹世界人民的斗志，破坏世界和平力量的团结和争取时间挽回军事颓势，最近正在玩弄两面手法，表面上做出某些和平的表示，骨子里加紧扩军备战，大力发展洲际导弹，到处建立和扩大导弹基地。可以肯定，美国统治集团这种阴谋是骗不了世界爱好和平的人民的，只是进一步证明帝国主义的本性是不会改变的，美帝国主义仍然是世界和平的主要敌人。我们全国妇女对美帝国主义这种两面手法必须保持充分警惕，一方面努力参加社会主义建设，不断加强自己的力量，同时要更加加强同以苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结和友谊，加强同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国维护民主和争取民族独立的团结和友谊，加强同全世界一切爱好和平的妇女的大团结，共同为保卫世界和平，维护妇女权利和儿童幸福而努力斗争。
