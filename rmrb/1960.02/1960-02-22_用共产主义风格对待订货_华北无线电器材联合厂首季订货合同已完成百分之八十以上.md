Using Communist Style to Treat Ordering
North China Radio Equipment United Factory Completes Over 80% of First Quarter Ordering Contracts

    (Our Dispatch) The North China Radio Equipment United Factory in Beijing treats the completion of ordering contracts from fraternal units as an important political task and its glorious responsibility. It vigorously carries out mass movements to guarantee the fulfillment of ordering contracts by every possible means. Up to now, the factory has completed more than 80% of the first quarter's delivery contract tasks and is now striving to complete the entire quarter's ordering contract tasks one month ahead of schedule.

    The North China Radio Equipment United Factory produces a variety of radio components, supplying the needs of radio, instrumentation, machinery manufacturing industries, as well as postal telecommunications, broadcasting, scientific research and other fields throughout the country. In the first quarter of this year alone, it signed 581 ordering contracts with 401 units, with more than 130 product varieties and more than 8,000 specifications.

    Based on the heavy ordering task, the factory's Party Committee adhered to putting politics in command as early as December last year, and mobilized all factory workers to take stock and engage in theoretical discussions. After discussion, all factory workers realized that in our socialist country, various economic sectors are a unified whole. As a factory producing radio components, its central task is to serve the rapid completion of equipment sets. Some people even used the relationship between clothes and buttons to illustrate the importance of each radio component, criticized the idea of being afraid of the trouble of producing small-batch contract products, and pointed out that treating each contract seriously is a concrete implementation of the spirit of "the whole country as a chessboard." Through taking stock and engaging in theoretical discussions, all factory workers further strengthened their overall perspective and raised their awareness of fulfilling contract tasks.

    On the basis of the improved ideological understanding of the vast number of workers, the factory convened a workers' representative meeting, made a resolution to complete all first-quarter contract tasks one month ahead of schedule, and changed the past situation where only a few full-time cadres were in charge of contracts, disclosing the contents of all contracts to the masses, so that the masses had a clear understanding. At the same time, a series of specific measures were taken to ensure the successful completion of various contract tasks.

    First, the completion of contract tasks is regarded as an important political task for the entire factory. The completion of contract tasks is given first priority in production in each branch factory, workshop, and team. Relevant departments also give priority to the needs of contract tasks in terms of the supply of materials, molds, and collaborative parts. Second, branch factories, workshops, and even production teams check the progress of completing contract tasks every day, not only checking the quantity, but also checking the quality, variety, and specifications. If problems are found, forces are immediately organized to tackle and solve them. Third, while grasping large ordering contracts, special attention is paid to the production of small-quantity orders that are easily overlooked. Special methods are adopted to organize the production of products with small quantities that are not easy to produce in batches. Fourth, contract tasks are grasped tightly at every stage, all the way to the end. Not only is production grasped, but also warehousing, packaging, and transportation, so that contract products do not stay in the factory and are transported to the ordering units at the fastest speed.

    The factory's efforts to vigorously grasp contracts not only enabled the early delivery of a large number of ordering contracts, strongly supporting the leap forward of fraternal units, but also greatly promoted the leap forward of the factory's production management and other work, making the technical innovation movement and socialist labor competition extremely lively. Since the beginning of this year, the factory has been overfulfilling all major indicators such as output value, output, quality, and variety every day, achieving red every day and a full house of red.

    用共产主义风格对待订货
    华北无线电器材联合厂首季订货合同已完成百分之八十以上
    本报讯　北京华北无线电器材联合厂完成兄弟单位的订货合同作为一项重要的政治任务，作为自己的光荣职责，大搞群众运动，千方百计保证实现订货合同。到目前止，这个工厂已经完成第一季度交货合同任务的80％以上，现在正力争提前一个月完成全季的订货合同任务。
    华北无线电器材联合厂生产多种无线电元件，供应全国各地无线电、仪表仪器、机械制造工业以及邮政电讯、广播、科学研究等方面的需要。今年第一季度就和四百零一个单位签订了五百八十一份订货合同，产品品种达一百三十多种，规格达八千多种。
    这个工厂的党委根据订货任务繁重的情况，早在去年12月份就坚持政治挂帅，发动全厂职工算账、务虚。全厂职工经过讨论，认识到：在我们社会主义国家，各个经济部门是一个统一的整体。作为一个生产无线电元件的工厂，它的中心任务就是为设备的迅速成套服务。有些人还以衣服和钮扣的关系，说明每个无线电元件的重要性，批判了对生产批量小的合同产品怕麻烦的思想，指出严肃认真地对待每一件合同，就是具体贯彻执行“全国一盘棋”的精神。经过算账、务虚，全厂职工进一步加强了全局观念，提高了执行合同任务的自觉性。
    在广大职工思想认识提高的基础上，这个工厂召开了职工代表大会，作出了第一季度的合同任务提前一个月全部完成的决议，并且改变过去只有少数专职干部抓合同的情况，把所有合同的内容全部向群众交底，使群众心中有数。同时采取了一系列的具体措施，保证各项合同任务的圆满实现。
    第一，把完成合同任务作为全厂的一项重要的政治任务，各分厂、车间、小组在生产中，首先保证合同任务的完成。有关部门在材料、工模具以及协作件的供应方面，也首先保证合同任务的需要。第二，分厂、车间直到各生产小组，天天检查完成合同任务的进度，不仅检查数量，还检查质量、品种和规格，发现问题立即组织力量突击解决。第三，在抓大宗订货合同的同时，特别注意抓容易被忽视的小量订货的生产。对数量小不容易成批生产的产品，采取了特殊的方法组织生产。第四，合同任务环环抓紧，一抓到底。不仅抓生产，也抓入库，包装和运输，做到合同产品在厂内不停留，以最快的速度运往订货单位。
    这个工厂狠抓合同的结果，不但使大批订货合同提前交货，有力地支援了兄弟单位的跃进，同时也大大促进了全厂生产管理等工作的跃进，使技术革新运动和社会主义劳动竞赛开展得热火朝天。今年以来，全厂天天超额完成产值、产量、质量、品种等各项主要指标，作到了日日红、满堂红。
