Highway Built to the Great Miao Mountains
(Reported by this newspaper) The first highway in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region to reach the Miao people - the Fu-San Highway - was fully opened to traffic on January 21st. This is a great happy event for the people of all ethnic groups in the Great Miao Mountains. The Fu-San Highway is 93 kilometers long. Its completion has changed the phenomenon in the Great Miao Mountain area where "you climb a mountain pass every ten steps you take, and it takes three days to walk to the house you can see across from you." After the opening of the highway, it no longer takes ten and a half days to travel from Sanfang to Rongshui, but only a few hours.

    公路修上大苗山
    本报讯　广西僮族自治区第一条通到苗家的公路——浮三公路于一月二十一日全线通车了，这是大苗山各族人民的一件大喜事。浮三公路全长九十三公里，它的建成，改变了大苗山区的“出门十步爬个坳，对门看见走三天”的现象，通车后，由三防至融水再也不用十天半月，而只用几个钟头就到了。
