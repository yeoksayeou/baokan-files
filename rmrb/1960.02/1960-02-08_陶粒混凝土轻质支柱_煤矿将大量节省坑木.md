Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou Electric Dispatch: The Jiaozuo Mining Bureau has recently successfully tested a type of ceramsite concrete lightweight pillar, which can save coal mines a large amount of pit props.

This ceramsite pillar has the characteristics of a solid column body, light weight, low cost, high compressive strength, and impermeability. Each ceramsite pillar only accounts for two-fifths of the weight of a cement support, is convenient to transport and operate, and can save two-thirds of the labor force. In terms of unit cost, it is only about half the price of pit props of the same specification, and if mass production is achieved in the future, the cost will be greatly reduced. The performance and technical standards of this ceramsite pillar fully meet the requirements of coal mining work surfaces.

The raw material sources for ceramsite pillars are more abundant than slag pillars. Its main component is clay, which is available everywhere, plus crushed mine slag, mixed with a small amount of cement and bamboo reinforcement, and can be made. The production process of this pillar is also very simple. First, the clay is baked into spherical crystals in a specially made ceramsite kiln, then mixed evenly with other mixed raw materials, and then poured into an earthen mold with bamboo reinforcement. After regular steam curing and cooling, the mold is removed.

    陶粒混凝土轻质支柱
    煤矿将大量节省坑木
    据新华社郑州电  焦作矿务局最近试验成功一种陶粒混凝土轻质支柱，可为煤矿节约大量坑木。
    这种陶粒支柱具有柱体坚固、重量轻、成本低、耐压强度高、不透水等特点。每根陶粒支柱仅占洋灰支架重量的五分之二，运输、操作轻便，能节省三分之二的劳动力；在单位造价方面，只有相同规格坑木价格的一半左右，将来大量生产，成本费用还会大大下降。这种陶粒支柱的性能和技术标准完全合乎采煤工作面的要求。
    陶粒支柱的原料来源比炉碴支柱更为丰富，它的主要成分是各地都有的粘土，再加上碾碎的矿碴，配以少量的水泥、竹筋，就能制成。这种支柱的制作过程也很简单。先把粘土放在特制的陶粒窑中焙烧成球状结晶体，再同其他混合原料搅拌均匀，然后注入土模中加入竹筋，经过蒸气定期养护、冷却脱模后即成。
