    Workers, Teachers, Students, Soldiers, and Street Residents Work Together – Take on Tasks, Contribute Materials, Voluntarily Take on Difficulties
    Break Down Industry Barriers, and Cooperatively Attack the Loading and Unloading Bottleneck
    Xuanwu District, Beijing, Produces Over a Thousand Pieces of Handling and Loading/Unloading Equipment in Twenty Days, Basically Achieving Loading and Unloading Mechanization

    (Reported by this newspaper) The fact that Beijing's two freight stations – Guang'anmen Station and Xibianmen Station – and the warehouses and transportation tools such as trucks, horse carts, and flatbed carts connected to these two stations, have achieved high-speed mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading vividly illustrates that under the leadership of the Party, breaking down unit boundaries, carrying out communist large-scale collaboration, and using the method of large-scale operations to jointly tackle weak links is an effective method for technological innovation that yields immediate results.
    Guang'anmen Station and Xibianmen Station are located in Xuanwu District. According to the situation of high-speed development of production in the district, the sharp increase in transportation tasks, but the lagging behind of loading and unloading forces, the Xuanwu District Committee of the Communist Party of China decided, after the Spring Festival, to concentrate the strength of the entire district to break through the loading and unloading key points of these two transportation hubs. The district committee put forward the slogan to the relevant units in the district: "Party committee takes command, mobilize the whole district, rely on our own efforts, support each other, combine indigenous and foreign methods, focus on key points, work hard for twenty days, achieve loading and unloading mechanization and semi-mechanization, and ensure doubling of transportation." Party committees at all levels organized relevant personnel to "conduct virtual discussions" to make the broad masses of workers clearly understand the principle of "doing a good job in transportation and promoting production." On the basis of unified thinking and understanding, more than 10,000 workers, teachers, students, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and street residents from relevant units throughout the district, carrying forward the spirit of communist cooperation, used the method of large-scale operations to rush to produce 1,176 pieces of handling and loading/unloading machinery and tools. In twenty days, they basically realized the "one-stop" loading and unloading mechanization, increasing the degree of loading and unloading mechanization from 21.3% to 80%, and doubling the loading efficiency. After these two stations basically realized loading and unloading mechanization, the problem of labor shortage caused by the doubling of transportation tasks this year compared with last year was successfully solved. The materials needed for factory production and the products produced in the entire district will avoid or reduce the phenomenon of backlog at the station, and basically can be delivered and sent out in a timely manner.
    In the struggle for mechanized handling and loading and unloading, lively scenes of communist large-scale collaboration were presented everywhere. At a meeting convened by the district committee to study mechanical processing and manufacturing issues, as soon as the secretary of the district committee raised the number of mechanical parts that needed to be processed and manufactured, the heads of various factories and enterprises rushed to take on the tasks and "ask for difficulties." Among the twenty factories responsible for manufacturing foreign machinery this time, some were not mechanical factories at all. Although some were mechanical factories or mechanical repair factories, there were still many difficulties in terms of equipment and technical strength. Most of the technical personnel in these factories had not designed loading and unloading machinery. After hearing the news, Beijing Railway College and Tangshan Railway College automatically sent people to help draw drawings. The district committee also transferred more than a dozen technical personnel from other factories to form several design teams according to the type of machinery, divide up the tasks, and solve the difficulty of insufficient design strength. The units responsible for mechanical manufacturing adopted the method of "if one person can't carry it, everyone will lift it together," classifying various machines and assigning one factory to take the lead, and then forming a large-scale assembly line of division of labor and cooperation network around this factory. For example, in the manufacture of 29 conveyors, nine factories cooperated, some making models, some making large shafts, some making rubber wheels, and finally concentrating on the Xuanwu Machinery Repair Factory for final assembly. Insufficient materials was the biggest difficulty. In addition to exchanging and helping each other, the units participating in the large-scale collaboration also launched a "picking up and donating waste materials movement." In just a few days, they picked up and donated 87 tons of scrap iron, more than 1,000 catties of copper, and more than 4,700 catties of rubber. Among them, copper was the most difficult material to find. In order to overcome this difficulty, hundreds of people "fought for copper." They heard that a factory processing copper parts had some copper filings flying into the soil of the factory building during cutting, so they rushed to the scene and, after obtaining the other party's consent, used the method of "gold panning" to find some copper.
    The machinery they manufactured was all manufactured in the spirit of combining indigenous and foreign methods and making do with whatever was available. In the Guang'anmen Station's vigorous campaign for loading and unloading mechanization, they started from scratch, borrowed pliers, axes, and saws, and vacated some dormitories and offices to open factories, learning while doing. As a result, in half a month, they manufactured more than 300 simple loading and unloading machines.
    Now, both sides of the railway lines of these two stations have been newly decorated with various loading and unloading machines. When the loading and unloading workers press a button or pull a handle, some large and heavy goods are cleverly hoisted by pulley blocks and cranes to the designated place. Simple machines transport lighter goods; power shovels and belt conveyors transport bulk goods such as coal and gravel.
    The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held an on-site meeting at Guang'anmen Station on the 24th to promote this experience of Xuanwu District.

### 职工、师生、官兵、街道居民一齐动手　包任务，出材料，主动要困难  打破行业界限协力攻打装卸关  北京宣武区二十天制成千余件搬运装卸机具基本实现装卸机械化

    职工、师生、官兵、街道居民一齐动手　包任务，出材料，主动要困难
    打破行业界限协力攻打装卸关
    北京宣武区二十天制成千余件搬运装卸机具基本实现装卸机械化
    本报讯　北京的两个货运车站——广安门车站和西便门车站，以及与这两个车站相联系的仓库和汽车、马车、排子车等运输工具，高速度实现装卸机械化、半机械化的事实，生动地说明：在党的领导下，打破单位界限，开展共产主义大协作，用大兵团作战的方法共同突击薄弱环节，是革新技术的立竿见影的有效方法。
    广安门车站和西便门车站座落在宣武区。中共北京市宣武区委根据全区生产高速度发展，运输任务激剧增加，但是装卸力量落在后面的情况，在春节以后，决定集中全区力量，突破这两个运输重点的装卸关键。区委向全区有关单位提出“党委挂帅，全区动员，自力更生，相互支援，土洋并举，狠抓关键，大干二十天，实现装卸机械化半机械化，保证运输翻一番”的口号。各级党委组织有关人员“务虚”，使广大职工明确认识了“办好运输，促进生产”的道理。在统一思想认识的基础上，全区各有关单位的一万多名职工、师生、解放军官兵和街道居民，发扬共产主义协作精神，用大兵团作战的方式，突击制成一千一百七十六件搬运装卸机械和工具，在二十天内就基本实现了“一条龙”装卸机械化，把装卸机械化程度从21．3％提高到80％，装车效率提高一倍。这两个车站基本实现装卸机械化以后，因今年运输任务比去年增加一倍而感到劳力不足的问题，顺利解决了。全区工厂生产所需的物资和生产出的产品，将避免或减少在车站积压的现象，基本上都能及时送到和发出。
    在为搬运装卸机械化而战的斗争中，到处呈现着共产主义大协作的生动场面。在区委召集的一次研究机械加工、制造问题的会议上，区委书记刚刚把需要加工制造的机械件数提出来，各个工厂企业的负责人就纷纷争着包任务，“要困难”。这次负责制造洋机械的二十个工厂，有一部分根本不是机械厂，有的虽是机械厂或机械修理厂，但是在设备、技术力量等方面都存在不少困难。这些工厂的大部分技术人员都没有设计过装卸机械，北京铁道学院、唐山铁道学院听到这个消息后，自动派人赶来帮助绘制图纸。区委又从别的工厂抽调来十多名技术人员，共同按机械种类划分成几个设计小组，分摊围攻，解决了设计力量不足的困难。负责机械制造的单位，采取“一人抱不动，大伙一块抬”的方法，把各种机械分类，由一个工厂挂帅，然后在这个厂周围组成大流水的分工协作网。例如，在制造二十九台输送机时，就有九个工厂分工协作，有的做模型，有的做大轴，有的做胶轮，最后集中到宣武机械修理厂总装配。材料不足是最大的困难。参加大协作的单位除了互通有无、互相帮助以外，还开展了一个“拣献废材料运动”。在短短几天之内，就拣献了八十七吨废铁、一千多斤铜、四千七百多斤胶皮。其中铜是最难找到的材料。为了克服这个困难，成百上千的人“为铜而战”。他们听说有个加工铜活的工厂，切削时有一部分铜沫飞落在厂房的泥土里，便闻风而去，在征得对方同意后，用“沙里淘金”的办法，找到了一些铜。
    他们制成的机械都是按照土洋并举、因陋就简的精神制造的。广安门车站在大搞装卸机械化运动中，白手起家，借来刀钳斧锯，腾出一部分宿舍和办公室开办工厂，边干边学，结果在半个月内，制造出三百多件简易的装卸机械。
    现在，这两个车站的铁路线两旁已被各种各样的装卸机械装饰一新。装卸工人一按电钮或一扳把手，一些大件的笨重货物，就被滑车和起重机轻巧地吊运到指定的地方。简易机械吊运着份量较轻的货物；电铲和皮带运输机运送着煤炭、砂石等散装货物。
    中共北京市委24日在广安门车站召开现场会议，推广了宣武区这一经验。
