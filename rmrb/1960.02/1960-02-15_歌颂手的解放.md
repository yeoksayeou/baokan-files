    Ode to the Liberation of Hands
    Li Fu
    For thousands of years, China's handicrafts, in every trade, have been primarily manual. Hands were both the power source and the tools. Now, workers in the iron, wood, bamboo, and clothing handicraft industries around West Lake are staging a vigorous technical revolution, bringing mechanical and semi-mechanical operations to 70%. Pairs of hands, calloused from long labor, are beginning to be liberated from heavy manual work. This is a liberation of the productive forces, and an important victory in the great march of China's numerous handicraft industries to conquer technological backwardness.
    Manual labor is a sign of backward production technology. In our "poor and blank" country, manual labor accounts for a large proportion. If this backward state left over from the old society is not changed, we cannot make the cause of socialist construction advance rapidly and comprehensively. Therefore, the Party Central Committee proposed "to use machines for all labor that can use machines" (Work Report of the CCP Central Committee to the Eighth National Congress, Second Session). This call of the Party Central Committee concentrates the wishes of the broad masses of the people, and thousands of hands point to one goal: "Dismount the old ox and ride a swift horse; mechanize manual operations."
    Now, due to the vigorous development of the technical innovation movement, the question before the broad masses of workers is no longer whether or not to, or whether or not it is possible to, realize mechanization and semi-mechanization, but to realize this goal at the fastest speed and in the shortest possible time. The workers in the four handicraft industries in Hangzhou are vanguards in this great revolution. In just half a month, they have basically realized mechanization and semi-mechanization throughout the industry. This shows that it is entirely possible to achieve technical innovation and technical revolution at high speed, and to liberate hands from heavy labor at high speed. The key here is for the Party Committee to make unified plans and strengthen leadership; to fully mobilize the masses and liberate their minds; and to vigorously promote collaboration and give play to the power of the collective.
    May everyone pay attention to the experience of Hangzhou, promote the technical innovation and technical revolution movement at high speed, and realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of all manual operation departments throughout the industry at high speed!

    歌颂手的解放
    犁夫
    几千年来，我国的手工业，不论哪一行，都是以手为主。手，既是动力，又是工具。如今，西子湖畔的铁、木、竹、服装四个手工行业的职工大闹技术革命，使机械操作和半机械操作达到了70％，一双双长满了老茧的手，开始从繁重的手工劳动中解放出来了。这是生产力的解放，是我国人数众多的手工业在征服技术落后的伟大进军中一次重要的胜利。
    手工劳动，是生产技术落后的标志。在我们这个“一穷二白”的国家里，手工劳动占有很大的比重。旧社会遗留下来的这种落后状态不改变，我们就不能使社会主义建设事业全面地飞速前进。所以，党中央提出，要“使一切能够使用机器的劳动都使用机器”（中共中央向八大二次会议的工作报告）。党的这个号召集中了全国广大群众的意愿，千万双手指向一个目标：“抛下老牛骑骏马，手工操作机械化”。
    现在，由于技术革新运动的蓬勃开展，摆在广大职工面前的问题，已经不是要不要、能不能实现机械化、半机械化的问题了，而是要用最快的速度，在最短时期内实现这个目标。杭州市四个手工行业的职工就是这场伟大的革命中的急先锋。他们在短短的半个月中使整个行业基本上实现了机械化、半机械化。这说明了，高速度地实现技术革新和技术革命，高速度地把手从繁重劳动中解放出来，是完全可能的。这里的关键就是要党委统一规划，加强领导；就是要充分发动群众，解放群众的思想；就是要大搞协作，发挥集体的力量。
    愿大家都重视杭州市的经验，高速度地推进技术革新和技术革命运动，高速度地实现手工操作部门的全行业的机械化和半机械化！
