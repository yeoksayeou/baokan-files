Xinhua News Agency, Havana, February 21st: The Cuban newspaper "Hoy" today, in a commentary on Eisenhower's visit to South America, denounced the crimes of U.S. planes bombing Cuba.

The commentary said that on the eve of Eisenhower's departure for South America, the United States had to admit that the planes that had been bombing Cuba had taken off from U.S. territory. The people of Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay, which Eisenhower will visit, cannot but express their reasonable shock and indignation at the serious incident of U.S. planes bombing Cuba.

The commentary pointed out that the hundreds of millions of simple people in Latin America cannot help but ask such questions: Is it possible that without the connivance of important officials and officers of the U.S. security agencies, planes that attack neighboring countries can freely enter and exit the United States without ever being checked? How could the American pirates who planned these flights and flew the planes to bomb Cuba buy bombs and other military equipment? How can the U.S. president rely on bombing Cuba and suppressing the Cuban revolution to fulfill his so-called promise of friendship with Latin America? These questions will not be dispelled by the smiles of the U.S. presidential campaign and the high-sounding nonsense about "free world," "good neighbor," and "Pan-Americanism to deal with the communist threat."

"Hoy" concluded by saying that although a large number of FBI agents will be surrounding Eisenhower during his visit to Latin America, the angry and dissatisfied voices of the Latin American people will still be heard by him.

Xinhua News Agency, February 18th: Montevideo news: According to "El Popular," Uruguayan Blanco Party Herrera faction Congressman Enrique Erro said at a parliamentary session that he opposed any ceremony by the parliament to welcome the U.S. president who will visit Uruguay. He said, "The people of Latin America live in poverty because U.S. monopoly organizations have taken away our wealth."

Erro's remarks were made during a recent debate in the Uruguayan parliament on whether to hold a special meeting to welcome Eisenhower. Several other members of parliament also spoke at the meeting criticizing Eisenhower's visit and the policies of U.S. imperialism. Communist Congressman Arismendi said in his speech, "We do not believe that Eisenhower's visit will help the independent development of our countries. On the contrary, this visit is an attempt to contain the independent process that is taking place in Latin America and has reached its peak due to the heroic achievements of the Cuban revolution."

Arismendi emphasized that the United States has more than 10 billion U.S. dollars in investments in Latin America, controls the economic lifeline of many countries, maintains feudal remnants, ruthlessly plunders the people of various countries, and carries out armed intervention when its interests are affected. He said that the intervention in Guatemala was such a case.

Arismendi emphasized that the people of Latin America are uneasily seeing that on the eve of Eisenhower's visit to some South American countries, the propaganda against Cuba is exactly the same as the propaganda before the U.S. armed intervention in Guatemala. At the same time, he said, military conspirators have also begun to appear in Venezuela. He emphasized that the Uruguayan people "cannot accept, allow, and welcome Eisenhower's visit."

Dubra, the representative of the Socialist Party parliamentary group, said in his speech that the U.S. president used to wear the cloak of "Inter-American Brotherhood" to cover up the U.S. aggression against Nicaragua, the occupation of the Guantanamo base in Cuba, and the armed intervention in Guatemala to protect the interests of the United Fruit Company.

Blanco Democratic Alliance Congressman Coliazo pointed out in his speech that the U.S. aggression against Guatemala or Puerto Rico cannot be forgotten. He said, referring to the recent U.S. propaganda slandering the Cuban revolution, "Its characteristics are very similar to the propaganda used to create an atmosphere for intervention in Guatemala."

Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: Rio de Janeiro news: The Brazilian Rio de Janeiro University Students' Union newspaper "Capital" recently published an editorial commenting on the upcoming visits of U.S. President Eisenhower and former U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Stevenson to Brazil.

The editorial believes that Eisenhower and Stevenson, when making direct contact with Latin American countries, especially Eisenhower, will understand that Brazil's friendship with the United States depends on Brazil not being oppressed by foreign monopoly capital.

The editorial pointed out that the people of Latin America and Asia and Africa have launched one of the greatest revolutions of the twentieth century, which is the revolution of the people of underdeveloped countries. The editorial said that the Cuban revolution, the actions of the governments of Mexico and Venezuela, and the labor movements in Cuba and Chile are obvious signs of pursuing new policies.

The editorial said, do U.S. decision-makers understand these signs, so that they are reflected in changing the relationship between the United States and Latin American countries? The editorial pointed out, in response to the U.S. plunder policy towards Latin American countries: Either the United States fundamentally changes its policy towards Brazil, or the current trend of Brazil's alienation from the United States will become an inevitable reality.

### 拉丁美洲人民同美帝国主义谈不到友谊

    拉丁美洲人民同美帝国主义谈不到友谊
    古巴“今日报”说艾森豪威尔将听到拉丁美洲人民愤怒的声音
    乌拉圭各党派议员说决不能忘记美国对拉丁美洲的侵略罪行
    巴西“首都报”说美国必须改变它对拉丁美洲国家的掠夺政策
    新华社哈瓦那21日电　古巴“今日报”今天在关于艾森豪威尔访问南美的一篇评论中，痛斥美国飞机对古巴进行空袭的罪行。
    评论说，在艾森豪威尔启程访问南美的前夕，美国不得不承认，过去一直在轰炸古巴的飞机是从美国领土起飞的。艾森豪威尔即将访问的巴西、智利、阿根廷和乌拉圭等国的人民对于美国飞机轰炸古巴的严重事件，不能不表示他们的合乎情理的震惊和愤慨。
    评论指出，拉丁美洲亿万纯朴的人民不禁会提出这样一些问题；没有美国保安机关的重要官员和长官的共谋，对邻国进行空袭的飞机在美国能够自由地出出进进而从来没有受过盘查，这难道是可能的吗？策划这些飞行和驾驶飞机到古巴进行轰炸的美国海盗怎么能够买到炸弹和其他军用设备呢？美国总统怎么能依靠空袭古巴和镇压古巴革命来实现他的所谓对拉丁美洲友好的诺言呢？这些问题不会因为美国总统竞选时的微笑以及“自由世界”、“睦邻”、“对付共产主义威胁的泛美主义”等等冠冕堂皇的连篇废话而烟消云散。
    “今日报”最后说，在艾森豪威尔到拉丁美洲访问期间，尽管美国联邦调查局的大批特务将寸步不离地围着他，但是拉丁美洲人民的愤怒不满的声音还是会让他听到的。
    新华社18日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：据“人民报”报道，乌拉圭白徽党埃雷拉派众议员恩里克·埃罗在一次议会会议上说，他反对议会举行任何仪式欢迎即将来乌拉圭访问的美国总统。他说，“拉丁美洲人民生活贫困，因为美国垄断组织夺走了我们的财富。”
    埃罗的这番话是在乌拉圭议会不久前辩论是否要举行特别会议欢迎艾森豪威尔时发表的。在这次会议上发言抨击艾森豪威尔的访问和美帝国主义政策的还有其他好几位议员。共产党众议员阿里斯门迪在发言中说，“我们不相信艾森豪威尔的这次访问会有助于我们各个国家独立的发展，恰恰相反，这次访问是企图遏止在拉丁美洲发生的、由于古巴革命的英勇业绩而达到高峰的独立过程。”
    阿里斯门迪强调指出，美国在拉丁美洲有一百多亿美元的投资，它控制了许多国家的经济命脉，维护封建残余，残酷地掠夺各国人民，并且在自己的利益受到影响的时候进行武装干涉。他说，对危地马拉的干涉就是这样。
    阿里斯门迪强调指出，拉丁美洲人民不安地看到，在艾森豪威尔访问一些南美国家前夕，反对古巴的宣传同美国当年武装干涉危地马拉前夕的宣传一模一样。同时，他说，在委内瑞拉也开始出现了军事阴谋分子。他强调说，乌拉圭人民“不能接受、容许和欢迎艾森豪威尔的这次访问”。
    社会党议会党团代表杜布拉在发言中说，美国总统过去披着“美洲兄弟情谊”的外衣，掩盖了美国对尼加拉瓜的侵略、在古巴关塔那摩基地的盘踞和为保护联合果品公司的利益而对危地马拉进行的武装干涉。
    白徽民主联盟议员科利亚索在发言中指出，不能忘记美国对危地马拉或波多黎各的侵略。他在谈到美国最近的诬蔑古巴革命的宣传时说，“它的特点很像为干涉危地马拉而制造气氛时的宣传特点”。
    新华社22日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西里约热内卢大学生联合会机关报“首都报”最近发表社论，评美国总统艾森豪威尔以及美国前民主党总统候选人史蒂文森即将前来巴西的访问。
    社论认为：艾森豪威尔和史蒂文森在和拉丁美洲国家进行直接接触的时候，尤其是艾森豪威尔，将会了解到：巴西同美国的友谊取决于巴西不受外国垄断资本的压迫。
    社论指出：拉丁美洲和亚非各国人民掀起了二十世纪的最伟大的革命之一，这就是不发达国家人民的革命。社论说：古巴的革命、墨西哥和委内瑞拉政府的动向以及古巴和智利的工人运动，正是奉行新政策的明显迹象。
    社论说，美国的决策人是不是看明白了这些迹象，从而反映在改变美国和拉丁美洲国家之间的关系上呢？社论针对美国对拉丁美洲国家执行的掠夺政策指出：要么美国根本改变它对巴西的政策，否则巴西目前同美国疏远的趋势将成为不可避免的现实。（附图片）
