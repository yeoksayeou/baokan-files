Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd: Washington News – In the face of the rising anti-American wave in Latin America, U.S. officials and the press are deeply concerned about Eisenhower's visit to South America. They do not conceal their anxiety: to what extent can this visit reverse the unfavorable position the United States is currently in?

According to a United Press International report on the 22nd, Washington congressional figures are buzzing about Eisenhower's trip to South America. Democratic Senator Hubert Humphrey suggested that the U.S. President should "carefully examine our (U.S.) policies toward Latin America" during his visit. Senate Democratic Leader Lyndon Johnson said: "Latin America has very difficult economic problems," and he expressed his hope that the United States would study these problems "with sympathy and understanding." Senate Foreign Relations Committee member Mike Mansfield also expressed hope that the U.S. government would "adopt a more flexible trade policy toward Latin America."

United Press International reporter Hansley, in a dispatch from Washington on the 20th, said that since Roosevelt's administration, "Americans have never paid so much attention to the issue of Pan-American relations." Hansley pointed out that Herter, despite preparing for the summit meeting, still decided to accompany Eisenhower to South America. "In two weeks, the American press and public opinion will focus on what the President says to his Latin American colleagues and the responses he receives."

At the same time, Hansley revealed that Washington officials said that although Eisenhower would try his best to "strengthen solidarity with the countries he visits," he "will not undertake clear political and economic obligations."

The "New York Times" editorial on the 21st also pointed out that Eisenhower would not satisfy the specific demands of some South American countries, but would only bring them "intangible goodwill." The newspaper said that the group of "well-trained personnel" that Eisenhower brought with him, such as Secretary of State Herter, "can only make a list of the issues to be resolved."

A United Press International dispatch from Washington on the 21st said that Eisenhower "does not deny that everything has not been going smoothly in the Western Hemisphere in recent years," and that anti-American sentiment in Latin America has made the United States increasingly concerned about the future of the so-called "Pan-American system" that it is trying to maintain. Eisenhower's trip to South America is "to solve these worrying problems."

When talking about how the United States should deal with the Cuban issue, the news agency admitted that "if the United States decides to take unilateral measures to deal with the Cuban revolutionary government immediately, other Latin American countries will undoubtedly rise up to defend Cuba as a whole."

The "Daily News" pointed out, "Do not expect the President's visit to solve any major problems."

    美国总统去南美卖假药
    华盛顿人士忧心忡忡
    新华社23日讯　华盛顿消息：在拉丁美洲高涨的反美浪潮面前，美国官方人士和报界对艾森豪威尔访问南美之行忧心忡忡，他们并不掩饰这种不安的心情：这次访问究竟在多大程度上能挽回美国目前所处的不利地位。
    据合众国际社22日报道，华盛顿议会人士对艾森豪威尔南美之行议论纷纷。民主党参议员休伯特·汉弗莱建议美国总统在访问期间要“小心谨慎地审视我们（美国）对拉丁美洲的政策”参议院民主党领袖林登·约翰逊说：“拉丁美洲有很困难的经济问题”，他表示希望美国“以同情和谅解”的心情去研究这些问题。参议院外交委员会委员迈克·曼斯菲尔德也表示希望，美国政府“对拉丁美洲采取一项更加灵活的贸易政策”。
    合众国际社记者汉斯莱20日从华盛顿发出的消息中说，自从罗斯福执政以来，“美国人还从来没有这样重视过泛美关系问题”。汉斯莱指出，赫脱尽管因为要准备最高级会议，仍然决定跟随艾森豪威尔前去南美。“在两星期内，美国报刊和舆论将集中注意总统对拉丁美洲同僚们所说的话以及他所得到的答复”。
    同时，汉斯莱透露，华盛顿官方人士说，尽管艾森豪威尔将竭力“加强同他访问国家的团结”，却“不会承担明确的政治、经济义务”。
    “纽约时报”21日的社论也指出，艾森豪威尔不会让某些南美国家当局的具体要求得到满足，而只是给他们带去“捉摸不到的亲善”。这家报纸说，艾森豪威尔随身带去的一批如像国务卿赫脱那样“训练有素的人员”“唯一能做的，是把有待解决的问题开列一张清单”。
    合众国际社21日自华盛顿发出的一条电讯说，艾森豪威尔“并不否认，近年来，西半球并不是一切都很顺利”，拉丁美洲的反美情绪使美国对它竭力维持的所谓“泛美体系的前途越来越耽心”。艾森豪威尔去南美，就是“为了解决这些令人悬念不安的问题”。
    在谈到美国如何对付古巴的问题时，这家通讯社承认，“如果美国决定立即采取片面的措施来对付古巴革命政府，其他拉丁美洲国家毫无疑问会全体起来保卫古巴”。
    “每日新闻”指出，“不要希望总统的访问能解决任何重大问题”。
