    Starting with the Production of "Brand Name Goods"
    The practice of all industries in Wuxi City striving for "brand name goods" is very meaningful. Producing "brand name goods" is a popular way of saying manufacturing high-grade, precision, and cutting-edge products. And organizing all industries to produce "brand name goods" is a powerful slogan for mobilizing the masses to advance towards "high-precision and cutting-edge" technology.
    Advancing towards "high-precision and cutting-edge" technology and producing "brand name goods" is a new requirement on the industrial front this year and an important part of the current technological revolution. If we can produce more high-grade, precision, and cutting-edge products in heavy industry, it means providing the country with more high-speed and high-efficiency equipment. This can then be used to greatly strengthen the weak sectors of industry and improve the level of industrial production technology. This will not only powerfully promote the technological transformation of agriculture and support agriculture in achieving continued leaps forward this year, but also ensure better and more comprehensive leaps forward in industry itself this year, and create conditions for continuous leaps forward in the future. Moreover, advancing towards "high-precision and cutting-edge" technology and producing "brand name goods" is also related to the major task of establishing a complete industrial system in our country as soon as possible and realizing the modernization of industry, agriculture, science, and culture. It is impossible to imagine that we can rapidly transfer all sectors of the national economy to a modern technological foundation without quickly mastering advanced science and technology. It is also impossible to imagine that we can quickly achieve industrial automation and agricultural technological transformation without quickly mastering the latest modern technologies. Therefore, only by vigorously carrying out the technological revolution, fiercely attacking technological frontiers, climbing the peaks of science, and producing more and more new types of equipment can we equip all sectors of the national economy with advanced technology and realize the modernization of our country's industry, agriculture, science, and culture as soon as possible.
    If we want to advance towards "high-precision and cutting-edge" technology, we must have the ambition to attack the frontiers and the courage to climb the peaks. As the workers say, "What others have, we must have; what others don't have, we must also create." We must have such ambition. The era we live in is an era of science and technology entering the realm of atomic energy and conquering outer space; the cause we are engaged in is the great cause of building socialism at high speed, which no one has done before. Although our production technology has made great progress in the past two years, and many products have caught up with and reached advanced international levels, we must never be satisfied with generally reaching international levels. We must explore and occupy new fields of science and technology and climb new peaks of science and technology.
    To develop "high-precision and cutting-edge" products, we must follow the mass line and launch a mass movement. That is to say, we must not only mobilize factories and enterprises to do it, but also mobilize professional research departments and schools to participate; we must not only mobilize experts and technicians to do it, but also mobilize the broad masses to work together. By doing so, we can not only mobilize the material and technical forces of all parties to ensure that the trial production and production of high-precision and cutting-edge products can be carried out in a faster, better, and more economical way, but also promote all departments to master and apply new technologies and drive the overall improvement of the level of production technology. In particular, through the mass movement of all industries advancing towards "high-precision and cutting-edge" technology, it can play the role of a universal technical "drill," which is conducive to cultivating and strengthening our scientific and technological team that attacks frontiers and climbs peaks. In the process of advancing towards "high-precision and cutting-edge" technology, we must pay special attention to organizing scientific research departments, schools, and factories and enterprises to cooperate with each other closely, so that theory and practice can be better combined. Factories and mines should continue to use the "three-way combination" method of cadres, workers, and technicians in order to fully utilize the wisdom and creative power of the masses and effectively overcome technical bottlenecks.
    Our emphasis on attacking frontiers, climbing peaks, and studying technology does not mean that we can ignore politics. On the contrary, we must further strengthen political and ideological work and combine politics and technology. Only when politics takes command will the enthusiasm of the staff and workers to attack frontiers and climb peaks be high, their determination will be great, their energy will be sufficient, and inventions and creations will continue to emerge.

### 从生产“名牌货”谈起

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    从生产“名牌货”谈起
    无锡市各行各业赶“名牌货”的做法，很有意义。生产“名牌货”，就是制造高级、精密、尖端产品的一种通俗说法。而组织各行各业生产“名牌货”，正是我们发动群众向“高精尖”进军的一个有力的口号。
    向“高精尖”进军，生产“名牌货”，这是今年工业战线上一项新的要求，也是当前技术革命的一项重要内容。如果我们在重工业生产方面能够拿出更多的高级、精密、尖端的产品，就意味着为国家提供了更多高速度、高效率的设备，从而就有可能用来大大加强工业的薄弱部门，提高工业生产技术水平。这样，既可以有力地推进农业技术改造，支援农业实现今年的继续跃进；同时，也可以保证工业本身今年更好、更全面的跃进，并且为今后连续跃进创造条件。不仅仅这样，向“高精尖”进军，生产“名牌货”，还是关系到尽快地在我国建立一个完整的工业体系，实现工业、农业、科学文化现代化的重大课题。不可能设想，不尽快地掌握先进的科学技术，就可以把国民经济的各个部门迅速地转移到现代化的技术基础上来。也不可能设想，不尽快掌握现代最新技术，就可以迅速实现工业的自动化和农业的技术改造。因此，只有大搞技术革命，猛攻技术尖端，攀登科学高峰，生产出越来越多的新型设备，才能用先进技术装备国民经济的各个部门，才能尽快地实现我国工业、农业、科学文化的现代化。
    我们要向“高精尖”进军，就一定要有敢于攻尖端的志气，敢于攀登高峰的胆略。工人们说得好：“人家有的我们要有，人家没有的我们也要创造。”我们就是要有这样的志气。我们所处的时代，是科学技术进入原子能和征服宇宙空间的时代；我们所从事的事业，是前人没有做过的高速度建设社会主义的伟大事业。两年来，我们的生产技术虽然有了长足的进步，许多产品已经赶上和达到了国际先进水平；但是，我们决不以一般地达到国际水平为满足，我们要去开拓和占领新的科学技术领域，攀登科学技术的新高峰。
    发展“高精尖”产品，必须大走群众路线，大搞群众运动。这就是说，既要发动工厂企业来搞，又要发动专业研究部门和学校来参加；既要发动专家和技术人员来搞，又要发动广大群众一起动手。这样做，不但可以调动各方面的物质技术力量，保证试制和生产高精尖产品能够多快好省地进行；而且可以促进各个部门掌握和运用新技术，带动生产技术水平的全面提高。特别是通过行行业业向“高精尖”进军的群众性运动，可以起普遍进行技术“练兵”的作用，便于培养和壮大我们攻尖端、攀高峰的科学技术队伍。在向“高精尖”进军的过程中，我们要特别注意组织科学研究部门、学校和工厂企业相互配合、紧密协作，使理论和实践更好地结合起来。对厂矿企业应当继续运用干部、工人和技术人员“三结合”的方法，以便充分发挥群众的智慧和创造力量，有效地攻克技术关键。
    我们强调攻尖端、攀高峰，钻研技术，决不意味着可以忽视政治，恰恰相反，我们要更加加强政治思想工作，把政治和技术结合起来。只有政治挂了帅，职工群众攻尖端、攀高峰的志气才会高，决心才会大，干劲才会足，创造发明才会不断涌现。
