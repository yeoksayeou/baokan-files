Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 17th - Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia, Huang Zhen, hosted a banquet tonight for the captains and crew members of the ships "Da Bao Kang" and "Fu An," which the Chinese government sent to bring overseas Chinese back to China.

During the banquet, Ambassador Huang Zhen proposed a toast to the health and smooth work of these guests. After the banquet, the guests watched the Chinese color film "Lotus Lantern."

These two ships entered Indonesian territorial waters a few days ago. However, the "Da Bao Kang" was only led into the port of Jakarta yesterday, and the "Fu An" was only arranged to dock at the Tanjung Priok port today.

So far, among the four ships sent by China to bring overseas Chinese back home, only the "Fu An" and "Mei Shang Mei" have been arranged to dock at the Tanjung Priok port.

    黄镇大使设宴招待接运华侨的船长和船员
    新华社雅加达17日电　中国驻印度尼西亚大使黄镇今晚设宴招待中国政府派来接运华侨回国的轮船“大宝康号”和“福安号”的船长和船员。
    席间，黄镇大使提议为这些客人的健康和工作顺利干杯。宴会后，客人们看了中国的彩色影片“宝莲灯”。
    这两艘轮船在几天以前就驶入了印度尼西亚领海。但是，“大宝康号”在昨天才被引入雅加达港口，“福安号”到今天才被安排停靠丹绒不碌港的码头。
    到目前为止，在中国派去接运华侨回国的四艘轮船中，只有“福安号”和“美上美号”两艘被安排在丹绒不碌港的码头停泊。
