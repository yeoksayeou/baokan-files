Changwei Special District Promotes Intercropping, Summer Harvest Area Expands by One-Third

(Our Newspaper News) The Changwei Special District of Shandong Province is vigorously promoting intercropping of barley, peas, potatoes, spring radishes, and Chinese cabbage in spring sweet potato and spring cornfields to expand the multiple cropping area and increase the yield of grain and fodder.

According to a survey in Wulian County, intercropping barley and peas in spring sweet potato fields can generally increase grain production by more than 100 jin per mu. After the autumn harvest last year, the Changwei Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party began to promote this farming experience throughout the district. After a winter, 610,000 mu of sweet potato ridges have been prepared throughout the district, with 312,000 mu intercropped with barley and peas. If the entire district can intercrop peas and barley in 3 million mu of spring sweet potato and spring cornfields this year, the summer harvest area will be expanded by one-third compared to the original. Calculated at a minimum yield of 100 jin per mu, the entire district can increase grain production by 300 million jin. (Attached picture)

    昌潍专区推广套种，夏收面积扩大三分之一
    本报讯　山东省昌潍专区大力推广在春甘薯、春玉米地中，套种大麦、豌豆、马铃薯及春萝卜、小白菜等，以扩大复种面积，增加粮食和饲料的产量。
    据五莲县调查，春甘薯地套种大麦、豌豆，一般每亩可增收一百多斤粮食。中共昌潍地委在去年秋收后，就开始在全区推广这一耕作经验。经过一个冬季，全区已扶甘薯垅六十一万亩，套种大麦、豌豆三十一万二千亩。如果今年全区能在三百万亩春甘薯地和春玉米地里都套种豌豆、大麦，夏收面积就会比原来扩大三分之一，按每亩最低产一百斤计算，全区可增产粮食三亿斤。（附图片）
