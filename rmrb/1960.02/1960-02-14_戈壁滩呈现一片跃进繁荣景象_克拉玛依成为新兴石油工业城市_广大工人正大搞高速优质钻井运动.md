(Dispatch from our newspaper in Urumqi) After more than four years of vigorous construction, Karamay has been built into a new petroleum city in our country. Since 1958, this large oil region has begun to produce a large amount of crude oil to supply the needs of the country's socialist construction. The former desolate Gobi Desert now presents a scene of leaping forward and prosperity everywhere.

The Karamay oil region was officially discovered in October 1955. From 1956, large-scale drilling work was carried out in the vast areas of Karamay and Urho, and several oil fields with large areas and high yields were found, with a drilling success rate of 80%. This fact completely shattered the fallacy of Western bourgeois scholars that China lacks oil, and eloquently proved that our country is a country with very rich oil resources.

In order to gradually meet the country's need for petroleum, the Karamay oil region has been exploring and producing oil since 1956. In 1959, the oil production increased fifty-seven times compared with 1956. In the past few years, large-scale mechanical factories, power stations, oil refineries, and oil pipelines have been built successively. In addition, nearly a thousand houses with a total area of more than 250,000 square meters have been built along the foot of the Genghis Khan Mountains. In the center of the residential area, tall buildings such as the China-Soviet Friendship Hall and a staff hospital with more than 300 beds have appeared. In July 1958, Karamay City was officially established here.

On the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, in 1959, the employees of the Karamay oil region continued to hold high the red flag of the general line, adhered to putting politics in command, and vigorously carried out mass movements. Under extremely difficult conditions, they achieved great achievements in continuing to leap forward. By December 16 last year, they had completed the year's production plans half a month ahead of schedule, and the oil production increased by 1.86 times compared with the Great Leap Forward in 1958. In October last year, the Karamay Mining Bureau was rated as an advanced unit in the national industry and transportation, capital construction, finance, and trade, and sent representatives to attend the national conference of heroes.

This year, the Karamay oil region will continue to have great development. According to the country's needs for crude oil production, crude oil production, drilling, and capital construction tasks will increase by about double compared with 1959. In order to rationally develop the oil field, we must focus on increasing production measures such as water injection in the oil field this year, and further manage the oil wells. Currently, it is the coldest season of the year, and antifreeze and heat preservation have become key issues in oil production. Since the night of December 31 last year, the broad masses of employees have been braving the severe cold and adopting local methods for heat preservation and strengthening wax removal in order to do everything possible to maintain the normal production of oil wells. The broad masses of drilling workers are fighting hard in the severe winter and vigorously engaging in a high-speed, high-quality drilling campaign to accelerate the expansion of the oil field area. In order to obtain new oil fields as soon as possible, many drilling teams moved to the construction site as early as the end of last year. The drilling team workers are determined to set a benchmark in the national petroleum system and create high drilling records.

    戈壁滩呈现一片跃进繁荣景象
    克拉玛依成为新兴石油工业城市
    广大工人正大搞高速优质钻井运动
    本报乌鲁木齐电　经过四年多的大力建设，克拉玛依已建设成为我国新兴的石油城。从1958年以来，这个大油区就开始生产大量原油，供给全国社会主义建设的需要。昔日的戈壁荒漠，如今到处呈现出一片跃进和繁荣景象。
    克拉玛依油区是1955年10月份正式发现的，从1956年起，就在克拉玛依及乌尔禾的广大地区内，展开了大规模的钻探工作，找到了好几个面积大、产量高的油田，钻探成功率达到80％。这个事实彻底粉碎了西方资产阶级学者所谓中国缺油的谬论，雄辩地证明了我国是一个石油资源十分丰富的国家。
    为了逐步满足国家对石油的需要，从1956年起，克拉玛依油区就边勘探边采油，1959年采油量比1956年增长了五十七倍。几年来，先后建成了规模较大的机械厂、发电站、炼油厂和输油管线等工程。此外，沿着成吉思汗山脚下，还建成了近千幢房屋，总面积超过二十五万平方米，在住宅区中心出现了中苏友谊馆和拥有三百多张病床的职工医院等高大建筑物。1958年7月，这里正式建立了克拉玛依市。
    在1958年大跃进的基础上，1959年克拉玛依油区职工继续高举总路线的红旗，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，在十分困难的条件下，取得了继续跃进的巨大成绩，到去年12月16日，就提前半个月完成了全年的各项生产计划，采油量比大跃进的1958年又跃增了一点八六倍。在去年10月，克拉玛依矿务局曾被评为全国工交、基建、财贸方面的先进单位，并派代表出席了全国的群英会。
    今年，克拉玛依油区将继续有大的发展。根据国家对于原油生产的需要，原油生产、钻井和基本建设任务都将比1959年增长一倍左右。为了使油田得到合理开发，今年要大抓油田注水等增产措施，进一步管好油井。目前正处在一年中最冷的季节，防冻保温成为采油产油生产上的关键问题。广大职工从去年12月31日夜间起，就冒着严寒，采取土法保温和加强清腊等办法，千方百计地保持油井正常生产。广大钻井工人正在奋战严冬，大搞高速优质钻井运动，加速扩大油田面积。为了尽快地得到新的油田，许多钻井队早在去年年底就住到工地。钻井队工人下定决心，要在全国石油系统树立标兵，创造钻井的高纪录。
