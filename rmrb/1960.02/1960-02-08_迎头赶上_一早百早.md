Short Commentary:

    Cotton is a spring-sown crop that is planted relatively late, generally around the "Grain Rain" solar term, when jujube trees begin to sprout. According to old habits, cotton planting was only considered after other spring-sown crops had been planted. Now, the old habits have been broken. Today, more than two months before "Grain Rain," many people's communes have already prepared cotton fields, irrigated them, and applied base fertilizer; carefully selected cotton seeds and conducted germination tests; cleared overwintering pests and manufactured indigenous pesticides to prevent and control diseases and pests; prepared livestock feed and repaired farm tools; launched a movement to learn from advanced experiences and formulated high-yield plans;... These facts show that cotton planting has greatly developed in the continuous great leap forward of the past two years, and people are more active in mastering and utilizing natural laws than in the past. Now, instead of waiting for spring to fill the earth before people start to get busy, chasing after spring, they are actively preparing everything before spring even shows its head, catching up head-on. This is a strong guarantee for moving from high yield to even higher yield, and striving for continued leap forward on the basis of the leap forward.

    "Jujube sprouting, planting cotton," means that the climate and soil temperature at the time of jujube tree sprouting are suitable for cotton growth. If you wait until the jujube trees have sprouted before plowing the fields, delivering manure, and then sowing, cotton will inevitably lose a favorable growing period. If you prepare in advance and sow in time when the opportunity arrives, you can fully utilize soil fertility, temperature, and moisture conditions, allowing the cotton to grow earlier, produce bolls earlier, and mature earlier. By increasing the proportion of pre-summer and summer bolls and relatively reducing the proportion of autumn bolls, you can reduce post-frost flowers. This will not only significantly improve the quality of cotton, but also greatly increase its yield. The Zhaizhuang Production Team of the Chengguan Commune in Fugou County adopted the method of greenhouse seedling cultivation last year, which advanced the growth of cotton seedlings by fifty to sixty days, and the yield per mu increased by about 60% compared to that of drill seeding. This fact eloquently illustrates the importance of early preparation.

    Cotton that grows at the right time can also enhance its ability to resist natural disasters and reduce losses caused by diseases and pests. Getting started early and preparing in advance can also gain the initiative during the busy spring plowing season, so that various farm tasks are not excessively concentrated, and labor will not appear too tense. This not only allows cotton to be planted early, planted more, and planted well, but also allows the entire spring plowing production to be completed in a calm and high-quality manner on time.

    The conditions for continued leap forward in cotton production this year are very good. The land has generally been deeply ploughed to varying degrees, and more fertilizer has been accumulated than in any previous year. Through the winter-spring water conservancy construction movement, the irrigated area has been expanded significantly, and planting experience and cultivation techniques have become richer. These are all objectively favorable conditions for striving for a bumper cotton harvest this year. However, in order to better combine these conditions with each other, complement each other, and give full play to their role, it is also necessary to fully exert human subjective initiative. This requires breaking with conventions and doing all the preparatory work before sowing. Only in this way can we be early in everything, a hundred times early, and strive for the initiative in every subsequent production stage, so that various conditions can fully play their role, and there will be a stronger guarantee for realizing the continued leap forward in cotton production.

### 迎头赶上  一早百早

    迎头赶上  一早百早
    棉花是春播作物中下种较迟的一种作物，一般都在“谷雨”节前后、枣树发芽的时候开始播种。按照过去的老习惯，也都要在其他春播作物种植以后，才考虑有关棉花播种的问题。现在，老习惯打破了，在距离“谷雨”还有两个多月的今天，很多人民公社已经整好棉田，灌了水，施了底肥；精选了棉籽，并进行了发芽试验；清除了越冬虫害，并为防治病虫制造了土农药；准备了牲畜饲料，修补了农具；开展了学习先进经验的运动，订立了丰产计划；……。这些事实说明，植棉工作在过去两年的连续大跃进中，有了很大的发展，人们在掌握和利用自然规律方面，比过去更加主动了。现在不再是等着春满大地，人们才开始忙碌，跟着春的后面赶；而是在春天尚未露头的时候，便积极地把一切工作都准备好，迎着春的头赶上去。这是从高产走向更高产，在跃进的基础上争取继续跃进的有力保证。
    “枣发芽，种棉花”，是指枣树发芽时候的气候和地温适合棉花的生长。如果等到枣树已经发芽，才去耕田、送粪，而后再去下种，这就使棉花势必失掉一段有利的生长时机。如果事先做好准备工作，时机一到，及时播种，这就可以充分利用地力、气温和水分等条件，使棉花早生长、早结桃、早成熟。多结伏前桃和伏桃，相对地减少秋桃的比重，就可以减少霜后花。这不仅可以使棉花的质量显著提高，产量也会大大增加。扶沟县城关公社翟庄生产队，去年采取温室育苗的办法，使棉苗生长提前五、六十天，亩产量比耧播的增加六成左右。这个事实，雄辩地说明了提前准备的重要作用。
    生长适时的棉花，并能增强抗拒自然灾害的能力，减少病虫害所造成的损失。及早动手，提前做好准备工作，还可以在繁忙的春耕季节取得主动，使各项农活不过分地集中，劳力也就不会显得十分紧张，这不仅可以把棉花种早、种多、种好，对整个春耕生产也能从容不迫，保质保量地按时完成。
    今年棉花生产继续跃进的条件是十分好的。土地一般经过了不同程度的深翻，肥料也比过去任何一年积得多，经过一冬一春的水利兴修运动，灌溉面积又扩大了许多，种植经验和栽培技术更加丰富了，这都是争取今年棉花丰收的客观有利条件。但是要使这些条件更好地互相结合起来，相辅相成更充分地发挥作用，还要充分发挥人的主观能动作用。这就要打破常规，在播种之前做好一切准备工作。只有这样，才能一早百早，事事赶早，以后的各个生产阶段才能争得主动，各项条件才能充分发挥作用，实现棉花生产的继续跃进才有更坚强的保证。
