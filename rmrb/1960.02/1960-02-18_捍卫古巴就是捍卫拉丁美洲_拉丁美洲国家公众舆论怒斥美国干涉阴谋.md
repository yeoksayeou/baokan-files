Xinhua News Agency, Rio de Janeiro, 16th: Brazilian Nationalist Parliamentary Front member, Cavalzirti, recently stated in the Chamber of Deputies that the Brazilian people consider the heroic struggle of the Cuban people as an example for the Brazilian people's struggle for liberation and the development of the Brazilian economy. He called on the Brazilian people to defend the people of this fraternal country.

Cavalzirti pointed out that when the Cuban government fulfilled its promise to change the feudal and colonialist structure, it touched the interests of the U.S. imperialist bloc. Consequently, the three major news agencies that monopolize news in the Americas launched a propaganda campaign to smear and distort the truth of the Cuban revolution. He said that Cuban Prime Minister Castro bravely faced and resolved Cuba's land problem, and he did not appease the large U.S. sugar and livestock companies, which were the largest landowners in Cuba. This is the real reason why the American newspapers, news agencies, and recently the U.S. government itself, have been attacking the Cuban revolutionary government. To protect these big landlords, U.S. corporate groups even plan to carry out military intervention in Cuba.

Cavalzirti emphasized that "if we do not rise to defend the people of this fraternal country, we are offering our country to international trusts." In Cuba and Brazil, international trusts are damaging national interests.

Cavalzirti's proposal was supported by another member of the Nationalist Parliamentary Front, Celso Brant. He said that defending the Cuban revolution is also defending the cause that Brazil will achieve.

Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, 15th: Some Argentine political parties and mass organizations jointly issued a statement to public opinion, calling on public opinion to support the Cuban revolution.

The statement was signed by the Argentine Committee for Support of the Republic of Cuba, the Youth League of the Progressive Democratic Party, the Communist Youth League, the youth organization of the Intransigent Radical Civic Union opposition, the Argentine University Federation, the United Federation of Secondary School Students, some trade unions, and other groups.

The statement emphasized that "since the Cuban authorities promulgated the first revolutionary laws, the affected forces, large estate owners, and American monopoly organizations have launched a joint international action." The statement pointed out that the aforementioned actions, encouraged by the U.S. State Department, are coordinated with the Inter-American Press Association, which uses some news agencies and newspapers to carry out activities to conduct slanderous news propaganda against Cuba, as a means of destroying and interfering with the Cuban revolution.

The statement stated that they support the Cuban revolutionary movement and call on the people of Argentina and all of Latin America to defend the cause of Cuba. The statement also called on public opinion to oppose the shameless joint attacks on Cuba by some newspapers and news agencies.

Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, 13th: The Uruguayan "People's News" recently published a commentary calling on people of all countries to strengthen "combative support" for Cuba "when U.S. imperialism is stepping up its interference and threats against Cuba."

The commentary said that U.S. President Eisenhower's insistence at a press conference on January 26 on the "right to protect legitimate American interests in Cuba" is actually to protect "the (American) large sugar companies' continued exploitation of Cuba's economy and the monopoly capital's continued unlimited enjoyment of Batista's unrequited concessions." What he calls "America's contribution to Cuba" is that it has been "extracting the island's economic blood for more than fifty years," plus "the (famous for enslaving the Cuban people) Platt Amendment, several U.S. naval interventions, and support for bloody dictators such as Machado and Batista." Now, when the Cuban people have taken control of their own destiny, the United States is threatening to turn it into another Guatemala.

    捍卫古巴就是捍卫拉丁美洲
    拉丁美洲国家公众舆论怒斥美国干涉阴谋
    新华社16日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西民族主义议会阵线议员卡瓦耳次提最近在众议院讲话时说：巴西人民认为，古巴人民的英勇斗争，是巴西人民争取解放和发展巴西经济的斗争的榜样，他号召巴西人民捍卫这个兄弟国家的人民。
    卡瓦耳次提指出：当古巴政府实现改变封建和殖民主义结构的诺言的时候，就触动了美帝国主义集团的利益，于是垄断美洲大陆新闻的三大通讯社就发动宣传运动来污蔑和歪曲古巴革命的真相。他说：古巴总理卡斯特罗勇敢地正视和解决古巴的土地问题，他并不姑息作为古巴的最大的地主的美国糖业和畜牧业大公司。这就是美国报刊、通讯社，最近则是美国政府自己，大肆攻击古巴革命政府的真正原因。为了保护这些大地主，美国企业集团甚至打算对古巴进行军事干涉。
    卡瓦耳次提强调指出，“如果我们不起来捍卫这个兄弟国家的人民，也就是把我们的国家奉送给国际托辣斯”，在古巴和巴西，国际托辣斯是损害民族利益的。
    卡瓦耳次提的主张受到民族主义议会阵线的另一名议员塞耳苏·布兰特的支持。他说：维护古巴的革命，也就是维护巴西将要实现的事业。
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯15日电  阿根廷一些政党组织和群众团体联合发表致社会舆论的声明，号召公众舆论支持古巴革命。
    在声明上签署的有阿根廷支持古巴共和国委员会、进步民主党青年联盟、共产主义青年联盟、不妥协激进公民联盟反对派青年组织、阿根廷大学生联合会、中学生联合会、一些工会和其他团体。
    声明强调指出，“自从古巴当局颁布了第一批革命法律的时候起，受到影响的势力、大庄园主和美国垄断组织就发动了联合的国际行动。”声明指出，上述受到美国国务院鼓励的行动得到美洲报业协会的配合，它利用一些通讯社和日报进行活动，对古巴进行诬蔑性的新闻宣传，以此作为摧毁和干涉古巴革命的手段。
    声明表示：它们支持古巴的革命运动，并且号召阿根廷和整个拉丁美洲的人民保卫古巴的事业。声明同时号召公众舆论反对一些报纸和通讯社对古巴进行的无耻的联合攻击。
    新华社13日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：乌拉圭“人民报”最近发表评论，号召各国人民在“美帝国主义加紧干涉和威胁古巴的时候”，加强对古巴的“战斗性的支持”。
    这篇评论说，美国总统艾森豪威尔1月26日在记者招待会上所坚持的“保卫美国在古巴的合法利益的权利”，实际上就是保卫“（美国）大甘蔗公司继续榨取古巴的经济和垄断资本继续无限制享受巴蒂斯塔无代价的让步的权利”。他所谓的“美国对古巴的贡献”，就是它“五十多年来榨取这个岛的经济血液”，加上“（奴役古巴人民的著名的）普拉特修正案、美国几次的海军干涉和对马查多、巴蒂斯塔等血腥独裁的支持”，而现在，当古巴人民掌握了自己的命运以后，美国又威胁要把它变成另一个危地马拉。
