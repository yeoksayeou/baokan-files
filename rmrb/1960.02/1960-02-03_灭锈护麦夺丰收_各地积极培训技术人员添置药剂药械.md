Eradicating Rust, Protecting Wheat, and Seizing a Bumper Harvest
Various Regions Actively Train Technical Personnel and Add Medications and Equipment

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Anhui, Shandong, Hebei, and Xinjiang, among other provinces and autonomous regions, are actively preparing for the prevention and treatment of wheat rust during the regreening period. They are currently training cadres and adding medications and equipment.

In the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, cadres from various localities are studying techniques for eliminating wheat rust and large-scale mechanical prevention and control of crop diseases and pests in Urumqi. Anhui Province plans to train a professional team for the prevention and treatment of wheat rust and other diseases and pests before wheat regreens. In the Fuyang Special Zone, five or six thousand people have already mastered the basic techniques for preventing and treating wheat rust and other diseases and pests. Plant protection and plant quarantine stations have been universally established in counties and communes throughout the special zone, and more than a thousand perennial professional teams for the prevention and control of crop diseases and pests have been established. Shandong and Hebei provinces are also training grassroots cadres for the prevention and treatment of wheat rust.

Regarding medications and equipment for the prevention and treatment of wheat rust, Shandong has prepared more than 5,000 tons of pesticides such as sulfur and barium polysulfide. Jiangsu has also prepared 9,000 tons of various medications, and is actively repairing sprayers and indigenous equipment.

After autumn sowing last year, due to high temperatures, wheat rust occurred earlier and was more serious than in previous years in many regions. However, prevention and treatment work in various localities also started early. Provinces and regions such as Shaanxi, Gansu, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Anhui, and Xinjiang have carried out universal prevention and treatment of wheat fields where rust has occurred. The prevention and treatment area in Shaanxi is twice as large as the area where rust occurred, basically controlling the rust, and eight counties and cities with no rust before winter have emerged. Gansu Province has also basically extinguished the spread of rust. Currently, the province has also organized a rust prevention and treatment inspection team, consisting of the Director of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and agricultural leaders from various special zones and counties, to inspect wheat fields in the Tianshui, Pingliang, and Dingxi special zones. They are inspecting and comparing notes, greatly promoting rust prevention work.

This newspaper reports: The people of Weinan County, Shaanxi, maintain a high degree of vigilance against the formidable enemy of wheat - rust. Currently, the county has made full preparations in terms of organizational work, technical force, and medication and equipment, standing in strict formation. As soon as rust occurs, they can launch a full-scale attack and annihilate it in one fell swoop.

After successfully achieving a rust-free county in December last year, Weinan County adopted the method of soldiers not removing their armor and horses not unsaddling, making full preparations in terms of organizational work, training technical teams, and medication and equipment. First, they paid close attention to preventing the possible idea of "everything is fine" among cadres and the masses after achieving a rust-free county, and used telephone conferences and other opportunities to repeatedly promote the need to establish a long-term rust prevention and eradication mindset. At the same time, they organized technical cadres to re-inspect various places, and immediately mobilized the masses to encircle and annihilate residual rust. They also seized the opportunity to organize and train technical forces, strengthen the long-term rust prevention team, and expand the county's rust prevention technical personnel from the original professional team of more than 25,000 people to more than 60,000 people. Based on the county's 1.1 million mu of wheat fields, there is an average of one technician for every 18 mu of land. In Huayin Commune, where rust has been serious in previous years, the rust prevention technical force is even stronger, with an average of one rust prevention technician for every four mu of land. In the Li Village Production Team of Guandao Commune, 80% of the young people have mastered rust prevention technology.

In order to organize the rust prevention team well, the county's ten communes have been divided into three joint prevention zones and three rust prevention protection belts – the Wei River coastal area is one belt, the plateau is one belt, and the mountain edge is one belt. Each belt is equipped with three to five rust monitoring and reporting points, with a total of seventeen monitoring and reporting points established, forming a county-wide monitoring and reporting network. In terms of medication and equipment preparation, the county has now prepared 2 million jin of indigenous pesticides, and plans to reserve 6 million jin of indigenous pesticides before the wheat regreening period. In places where preparations have been done well, each labor force has an average of ten jin of pesticides.

Now, the people of Weinan County are under the battle slogan of "Rust eradication ideology comes first, organizational team is sound, technical medication and equipment are all set, we will not give up until we eradicate rust," standing in strict formation, ready to launch a full-scale attack to annihilate rust at a single order.

    灭锈护麦夺丰收
    各地积极培训技术人员添置药剂药械
    新华社讯　安徽、山东、河北和新疆等省、区，积极地为防治小麦返青时期的锈病作好准备。目前正在培养训练干部和添置药械。
    新疆维吾尔自治区各地的干部正在乌鲁木齐市学习消灭小麦锈病和大型机械防治农作物病虫害的技术。安徽省准备在小麦返青以前，训练一批防治小麦锈病及其他病虫的专业队伍。阜阳专区各地现在已有五、六千人掌握了防治小麦锈病和其他病虫的基本技术。全专区的各个县、社还普遍建立了植物保护和植物检疫站，建立了一千多个常年防治农作物病虫害的专业队。山东、河北两省也正在训练防治小麦锈病的基层干部。
    在防治小麦锈病的药械方面，山东已准备好硫磺和多硫化钡等农药五千多吨。江苏也准备了各种药剂九千吨，同时还在积极修理喷雾器和土器械。
    去年秋播后，因为气温高，许多地区小麦锈病发生比往年早，并且比往年严重。但是各地的防治工作也都抓得很早。陕西、甘肃、山东、山西、河南、安徽和新疆等省、区对发生锈病的麦田都进行了普遍的防治。陕西防治面积比发生面积大两倍，基本上控制了锈病，并出现了八个冬前无锈病的县、市。甘肃省也已基本扑灭了锈病的蔓延。目前，这个省还组织了由省农业厅长和各专区、县农业领导干部参加的锈病防治检查团，巡视检查天水、平凉、定西三个专区的麦田，他们边检查、边评比，大大推动了防锈病工作。
    本报讯　陕西渭南县人民对小麦劲敌——锈病，始终保持高度警惕。目前，这个县已从组织工作、技术力量、药械装备方面作了充分准备，严阵以待，只要锈病一发生，就可全线出击，一举歼灭。
    渭南县在去年12月胜利实现无锈病县以后，就采取兵不解甲、马不卸鞍的办法，从组织工作、训练技术队伍、药械装备等方面做了充分准备。首先，他们十分注意防止在实现无锈病县后干部和群众中可能产生的万事大吉思想，利用电话会议等各种机会，反复宣传必须树立长期防锈灭锈思想。同时组织技术干部到各地复查，发现残余锈病，立即动员群众围歼。他们又抓紧组织、训练技术力量，壮大长期防锈队伍，全县防锈技术人员由原来专业队的两万五千多人扩大到六万余人。按全县一百一十万亩麦田计算，平均十八亩地就有一名技术员。在历年锈病严重的华阴公社，防锈技术力量更强，平均四亩地就有一名防锈技术员。官道公社李屯生产队，80％的青年都掌握了防锈技术。
    为了把防锈队伍组织好，全县十个公社，划分了三个联防区和三个防锈保护带——渭河沿岸为一带，高原为一带，山边为一带。每带又设置三至五个锈病测报点，共设测报点十七处，形成了全县性的测报网。在药械准备方面，现在全县已备好二百万斤土农药，赶小麦返青期前，要储备六百万斤土农药。准备工作做得好的地方，平均每个劳力，已有十斤农药。
    现在，渭南县人民正在“灭锈思想在先，组织队伍健全，技术药械齐上马，不灭锈病誓不甘”的战斗口号下，严阵以待，只要一声号令，即可全线出动，歼灭锈病。
