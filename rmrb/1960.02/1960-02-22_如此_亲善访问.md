Such a "Goodwill Visit"
Chi Bei'ou Poem, Fang Cheng Painting

	The president is about to go on a mission,
	To peddle false friendship,
	Heading to South America,
	As if facing a great enemy.

	A large army protects the royal carriage,
	Still afraid of mishaps,
	Preparing to meet the head of state.
	First, search the official residence,
	Strictly guard against ambushes,
	To avoid assassination.

	Arriving in various cities,
	Trying hard to hide his whereabouts,
	Dare not travel by car,
	Always by airplane,
	Not because of the long distance,
	But afraid of tomatoes,
	Nixon tasted it,
	It really wasn't good.

	Since it is like this,
	Why bother to suffer? (Attached picture)

    如此“亲善访问”
    池北偶诗　方成画
    总统要出使，
    贩卖假友谊，
    前往南美洲，
    有如临大敌。
    大军保御驾，
    仍旧怕有失，
    准备见元首。
    先行搜官邸，
    严防有埋伏，
    以免遭行刺。
    到达各城市，
    极力藏行迹，
    不敢坐汽车，
    一律乘飞机，
    并非因路远，
    是怕西红柿，
    尼克松尝过，
    实在不是味。
    既然是如此，
    何必找苦吃。（附图片）
