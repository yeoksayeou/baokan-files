Xinhua News Agency, February 28th, New York Dispatch: In eighteen cities in five states in the southern United States, broad masses of Black people have recently launched a massive movement against racial discrimination. The specific goal of the struggle is to abolish the system of discrimination against Black people that has long been practiced in restaurants and other public eating places in the American South.

This mass struggle of American Black people for racial equality erupted on February 1st and is now not only widely unfolding in the American South but also receiving responses in the American North and the Deep South.

In many states in the American South, restaurants and other eating places opened by white people do not allow Black people to sit, and Black people can only eat standing up. This unwritten law, aimed at showing "white supremacy," is one of the various forms of discrimination and insult against Black people in the United States.

On February 1st, in Greensboro, North Carolina, four Black students sat down to eat in a restaurant opened by white people. The restaurant's racially prejudiced staff rudely ordered them to stand up. These Black students sternly refused this request and continued to sit at their table. This heroic action aroused the support of the broad masses of Black people in the American South, and the "sit-in" quickly became a mass movement. In Tennessee, South Carolina, Florida, North Carolina, and Virginia, thousands upon thousands of Black people, especially Black youth, followed the example of these four Black students, pouring into local white-owned restaurants demanding to enjoy the same treatment as white people, or simply sitting there and refusing to leave. For example, in Richmond, Virginia, 400 Black youths held a "sit-in" on the 22nd. In Chattanooga, Tennessee, 1,500 Black people marched in the streets on the 25th in support of the "sit-inners." Even in New York in the northern United States and in Washington, the capital of the United States, Black students, with the support of white people with a sense of justice, held demonstrations against discrimination against Black people.

According to one of the leaders of this movement, Reverend Martin Luther King, who led the struggle of Black masses in Montgomery in 1956 to resist discriminatory bus companies, this movement is very likely to spread to Georgia, Alabama, and Louisiana, becoming the prelude to a large-scale offensive by American Black people against racial discrimination. On the 27th, approximately one thousand Black students in Alabama held demonstrations and mass rallies, joining in this struggle.

The new upsurge in the American Black people's movement against racial discrimination has caused immense panic among American racists. They are using violence in an attempt to frustrate the fighting spirit of Black people. For example, in Richmond, Nashville, Tallahassee and other places, the authorities dispatched police to arrest Black demonstrators on a large scale. In these recent days incidents of racists picking quarrels with Black people and beating Black people have emerged one after another in many places. The reactionary authorities of many states are hastily passing laws aimed at prohibiting these "sit-ins." For example, the Virginia legislature passed three new so-called "anti-trespassing laws" to deal with this movement of Black people. The Georgia legislature passed a bill authorizing restaurants to expel so-called "uninvited guests." The Attorney General of North Carolina has notified white racist restaurant owners that they can charge Black demonstrators with the crime of "trespassing."

This struggle of American Black people has aroused widespread commentary in American newspapers. Some bourgeois newspapers are viciously attacking and cursing Black people, or expressing deep anxiety about the development of this movement. "The New York Times," for example, wrote with great unease, "The current wave of demonstrations reflects a growing determination among Black people to accelerate the end of discrimination against them in all aspects." This newspaper is worried that the Black masses will take further measures to fight for their due rights.

### 反对种族歧视  争取平等权利  美国南部黑人展开大规模斗争

    反对种族歧视  争取平等权利
    美国南部黑人展开大规模斗争
    新华社28日讯　纽约消息：在美国南部五个州十八个城市里，广大黑人群众最近展开了声势浩大的反对种族歧视的运动。斗争的具体目标是取消美国南部的饭店及其他公共饮食场所一直奉行的歧视黑人的制度。
    美国黑人这一次争取种族平等的群众性斗争是在2月1日爆发的，目前不仅在美国南部广泛展开，而且在美国北方和极南部也得到响应。
    在美国南部许多州里，白人开设的饭店和其他饮食场所不许黑人入座，黑人只能站着吃。这种目的在于显示“白人优越”的不成文法，是美国对黑人的种种歧视和侮辱之一。
    2月1日在北卡罗来纳州格林斯博罗，四个黑人学生在一家白人开设的饭店入座用膳，饭店的具有种族主义思想的人员无礼地命令他们站起来。这几个黑人学生严正地拒绝了这种要求，继续坐在他们的饭桌旁边。这个英勇行动激起了美国南部广大黑人的支持，“静坐示威”很快就成了一个群众性的运动。在田纳西、南卡罗来纳、佛罗里达、北卡罗来纳和弗吉尼亚各州，成千成百的黑人、特别是黑人青年仿效着这四名黑人学生的榜样，涌入了当地白人开设的饭店要求享受同白人一样的待遇，不然就坐着不走。例如在弗吉尼亚州的里士满，22日有四百名黑人青年举行了“静坐示威”。在田纳西州的恰塔努加，一千五百名黑人25日在街上游行，支持“静坐示威者”。甚至在美国北部的纽约和美国首都华盛顿，黑人学生在有正义感的白人的支持下也举行了反对歧视黑人的示威。
    据这个运动的带头人之一、1956年曾经在蒙哥马利城领导黑人群众抵制歧视黑人的公共汽车公司的斗争的牧师马丁·路德·金前几天说，这个运动还很可能扩展到佐治亚、阿拉巴马和路易斯安那州，成为美国黑人对种族歧视进行大规模进攻的前导。在27日，阿拉巴马州约一千名黑人学生已经举行了示威游行和群众集会，投身于这一场斗争中。
    美国黑人反对种族歧视运动的新高涨引起了美国种族主义者的无比惶恐。他们正在使用暴力企图挫折黑人的斗志。例如在里士满、纳希维利、塔拉哈西等地当局就出动警察大肆逮捕黑人示威者。这几天种族主义者在许多地方向黑人寻衅、殴打黑人的事件层出不穷。许多州的反动当局正在急急忙忙通过目的在于禁止这种“静坐示威”的法令。例如弗吉尼亚州议会通过了三个新的所谓“禁止侵入房屋法”来对付黑人这一运动。佐治亚州议会通过了一个法案，授权饭店有权驱逐所谓“不速之客”。北卡罗来纳州的司法部长已通知白人种族主义者开设的饭店可以用“侵入房屋”的罪名来控告黑人示威者。
    美国黑人这一个斗争引起了美国报纸的广泛评论。一些资产阶级报纸正在恶毒地攻击和咒骂黑人，或者对这个运动的发展表示深切的不安。“纽约时报”就曾经十分不安地写道，“目前的这种示威浪潮反映了黑人的一种日益增长的千方百计地加速结束他们在各个方面受歧视的状况的决心”。这家报纸担心黑人群众还将会采取进一步的措施，来争取他们应有的权利。
