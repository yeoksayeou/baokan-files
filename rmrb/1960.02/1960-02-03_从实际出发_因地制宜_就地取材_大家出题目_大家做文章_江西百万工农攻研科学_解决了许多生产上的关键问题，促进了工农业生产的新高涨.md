　　Jiangxi's Million Workers and Peasants Tackle Scientific Research
　　Solved many key production problems, promoting a new upsurge in industrial and agricultural production

　　(Our Dispatch) The million workers and peasants in Jiangxi Province are participating in scientific and technological research activities. Scientific research organizations have been universally established at the provincial, prefectural, county, commune, factory, mine, enterprise, and school levels, forming a vast mass scientific research network throughout the province. Due to the participation of workers and peasants in scientific research activities, many key production problems have been readily solved, a large number of sophisticated, cutting-edge, and novel products have emerged, greatly promoting a new upsurge in industrial and agricultural production.

　　In recent years, due to the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, technical strength has become one of the most urgent problems to be solved. In particular, the Great Leap Forward of 1958 and the continued leap forward of 1959 presented many new tasks that urgently needed to be solved by scientific research work. To this end, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to extensively mobilize the masses and rely on the workers and peasants to solve this contradiction. It successively convened two provincial scientific work conferences, calling on the vast workers and peasants to carry forward the communist style of daring to think and daring to act, to vigorously engage in scientific and technological revolution, and to march towards science and technology, in order to meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. The Provincial Party Committee's call received a broad response. Party committees at all levels throughout the province strengthened their leadership over scientific work, and provincial, prefectural, county, and commune levels, as well as government agencies, enterprises, universally established scientific branch academies, institutes, and scientific research groups, rapidly setting off a surge to march towards science and technology. To date, in addition to the establishment of the Jiangxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, each prefecture and county has established a scientific branch academy, and dozens of specialized research institutes, such as metallurgy, coal, agriculture, applied physics, and chemistry, have been established throughout the province. In the vast rural areas, government agencies, enterprises, and schools, a total of nine hundred and eighty grassroots scientific organizations and more than forty-three thousand scientific research groups have been established. According to preliminary statistics, the number of people participating in scientific research activities exceeds one million.

　　The most prominent characteristic of the participation of workers and peasants in scientific and technological research activities is to proceed from reality, adapt to local conditions, use local materials, everyone proposes topics, and everyone writes articles, thereby solving the key problems that need to be solved urgently in production. For example, after the construction of the Ganfu Plain comprehensive development project, construction was suspended due to a shortage of reinforced concrete, and a reinforced concrete aqueduct originally designed could not be started. Therefore, the Party Committee called on the masses to carry out research activities to overcome this "fortress." As a result, the method of using wooden aqueducts was boldly adopted, which not only saved a lot of reinforced concrete, but also saved a lot of funds. In order to increase the yield per unit area of rice, Xiangdong Commune in Pingxiang cultivated the late-season japonica rice variety No. 8, which was six feet tall, with more than 300 grains per ear, and a yield of 1,489 jin per mu. The cotton varieties Pengze No. 1 and Pengze No. 4 cultivated in Pengze County produce 300 to 420 bolls of cotton per plant. In addition, the birth of the Jiangxi Fengshou Type 27 tractor and the Type 59 rice transplanter also embodies the infinite wisdom and labor of the vast workers and peasants.

　　Through mass scientific research activities, the masses' understanding of science has been improved, and cadres have also been trained. Some farmers in Raofang Brigade, Shangtang Commune, Nancheng County, did not believe that doing science had any benefits in the past. They said, "There is no special trick in farming, as long as you have enough strength, apply more fertilizer, and you will definitely have a good harvest." Later, this team established the Raofang Youth Scientific Research Institute, and formed research groups for rice, cotton, vegetables, and breeding, respectively, to apply fertilizer rationally, irrigate rationally, and conduct scientific field management, prevent lodging of seedlings due to green wind, and extinguish pests of late rice, and obtained a bumper harvest.

　　The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee recently convened the Third Provincial Scientific Work Conference, which summarized the achievements and experiences of scientific research work last year, and deployed and planned this year's scientific work.

    从实际出发　因地制宜　就地取材　大家出题目　大家做文章
    江西百万工农攻研科学
    解决了许多生产上的关键问题，促进了工农业生产的新高涨
    本报讯　江西省百万工农群众参加科学技术研究活动，省、专、县、社、厂矿、企业、机关、学校普遍设立科学研究组织，形成了一个遍及全省的广大群众性的科学研究网。由于工农群众参加科学研究活动，许多生产上的关键问题迎刃而解，精、尖、新产品大量涌现出来，大大地推动了工农业生产的新高涨。
    几年来，由于工农业生产的迅速发展，技术力量成了最迫切需要解决的问题之一。特别是1958年的大跃进和1959年的继续跃进，给科学研究工作提出了许多迫切需要解决的新课题。为此，中共江西省委决定广泛地发动群众，依靠工农群众解决这个矛盾。先后召开了两次全省性的科学工作会议，号召广大工农群众发扬敢想敢做的共产主义风格，大搞科学技术革命，向科学技术进军，以适应社会主义建设大跃进的需要。省委的号召，得到了广泛的响应。全省各地党委加强了对科学工作的领导，省、专、县、社和机关、企业，普遍建立了科学分院、所和科学研究组，迅速掀起了向科学技术进军的热潮。至目前止，除建立了中国科学院江西分院外，各专、县都建立了科学分院，全省建立了冶金、煤炭、农业、应用物理、化学等几十个专业研究所。广大农村和机关、企业、学校，共建立了九百八十个基层科学组织和四万三千多个科学研究小组。参加科学研究活动的人数，据初步统计，超过了一百万人。
    工农群众参加科学技术研究活动，最显著的特点是从实际出发，因地制宜，就地取材，大家出题目，大家做文章，从而解决了生产上急需解决的关键性的问题。如赣抚平原综合开发工程施工以后，因钢筋水泥不足停工待料，原来设计的一个钢筋水泥的渡槽无法动工。于是党委便号召群众开展研究活动，攻克这个“堡垒”。结果大胆地采取了改用木质渡槽的办法，不仅节省了大量的钢筋，水泥，也节省了大量资金。萍乡湘东公社为了提高稻谷单位面积产量，培养出的晚粳八号稻谷品种，谷高六尺，每穗结谷三百余粒，亩产达一千四百八十九斤。彭泽县培养出来的棉花品种彭泽一号和彭泽四号，每株棉花结桃三百个到四百二十个。此外，江西丰收二七型拖拉机、五九型插秧机的诞生，也都凝结着广大工农群众的无限的智慧和劳动。
    通过群众性的科学研究活动，提高了群众对科学的认识，也锻炼了干部。南城县上塘公社饶坊大队有的农民，过去不相信搞科学有什么好处。他们说：“种田无别巧，只要气力饱，多下些肥料，定能收成好。”后来，这个队成立了饶坊青年科学研究所，并分别组成水稻、棉花、蔬菜、饲养等研究小组，合理施肥，合理灌溉和进行科学的田间管理，防止了禾苗的青风倒伏，扑灭了晚稻的害虫，获得了丰收。
    江西省委和省人委最近召开了全省第三次科学工作会议，总结了去年科学研究工作的成绩和经验，布置和规划了今年的科学工作。
