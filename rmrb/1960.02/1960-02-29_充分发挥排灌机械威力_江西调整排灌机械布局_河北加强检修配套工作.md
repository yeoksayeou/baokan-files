Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, February 28th: Jiangxi is making full use of the power of irrigation and drainage machinery. Various locations in Jiangxi, based on the new situation after large-scale water conservancy construction, are comprehensively adjusting the layout of irrigation and drainage machinery, and are carrying out early mechanical overhauls, manufacturing, and training of technical personnel, so that the irrigation and drainage machinery can maximize its effectiveness in spring plowing production.

Last winter, water conservancy projects built in Jiangxi expanded and improved the irrigation area by more than 10 million mu. Combined with the projects built in the previous few years, 53% of the province's farmland has now achieved gravity irrigation. However, some high slopes and low-lying areas are still unable to eliminate the threat of drought and flood due to the current lack of water conservancy facilities and the incomplete construction of larger water conservancy projects. For this reason, all counties have rationally adjusted the layout of irrigation and drainage machinery, transferring surplus irrigation and drainage machinery from gravity-irrigated areas to areas in need according to the principle of equivalent exchange, so as to maximize the effectiveness of the irrigation and drainage machinery. Xiushui County transferred more than 270 horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery from areas with good water conservancy conditions and a large amount of machinery to areas with poor water conservancy conditions, less irrigation and drainage machinery, and large areas of crops, thereby increasing the benefited area by more than 8,100 mu.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 28th: There are currently more than 51,000 irrigation and drainage machines of various types in rural Hebei Province, with a total of more than 500,000 horsepower. In order to give full play to the effectiveness of these machines, the water conservancy, industrial, and commercial departments have jointly formed irrigation and drainage machinery repair offices or headquarters to supervise repair and supporting work. Many counties and communes have established repair and fitting factories or repair and fitting stations. Various localities have also organized a large number of technical personnel to go deep into the communes and production teams to inspect, repair, and install equipment. By mid-February, 75% of the machinery that needed repair in the province had been repaired.

Various localities are also actively cultivating and training technical teams, striving to have three drivers for each machine. A total of 38,000 drivers have been trained in the province, plus the original drivers, totaling 103,000. There are currently another 10,000 people undergoing training.

    充分发挥排灌机械威力
    江西调整排灌机械布局  河北加强检修配套工作
    据新华社南昌28日电　江西各地根据大兴水利以后的新形势，全面调整排灌机械布局，并及早进行机械检修、赶制和训练技术人员，使排灌机械在春耕生产中最大限度地发挥效用。
    江西各地去冬兴修的水利工程共扩大和改善灌溉面积一千多万亩，加上前几年兴修的工程，全省已有53％的农田实现了自流灌溉。但一些高坡和低洼地区，由于目前还缺乏水利设施和较大的水利工程没有完工，还未能解除旱涝威胁。为此，各县都合理地调整排灌机械的布局，根据等价交换的原则，把自流灌溉地区多余的排灌机械抽调到需要的地区，最大限度地发挥排灌机械的效能。修水县从水利条件好、机械多的地区抽调了二百七十多马力的排灌机械，到水利条件差、排灌机械少、农作物种植面积大的地区，从而增加了八千一百多亩受益面积。
    据新华社天津28日电　河北省农村当前已有各种排灌机械五万一千多台，共五十多万马力。为了充分发挥这些机械的效能，各地由水利、工业、商业部门联合组成排灌机械检修办公室或指挥部，督促检修和配套工作。不少县、社已经成立了修配厂或修配站。各地还组织了大批技术力量，巡回深入公社、生产队，边检查，边修理，边安装。到2月中旬，全省应修机械已有75％检修好。
    各地还积极培养训练技术队伍，力求一台机器有三个司机。全省已训练好司机三万八千人，加上原有的司机共达十万零三千人，目前正在训练的还有一万人。
