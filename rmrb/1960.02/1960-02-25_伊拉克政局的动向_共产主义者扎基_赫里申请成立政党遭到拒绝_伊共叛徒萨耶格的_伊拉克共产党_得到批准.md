Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 24th - Since the Iraqi government officially announced the end of the "transition period" on January 6th, the applications of the National Democratic Party and the Kurdistan Democratic Party have been approved, but the request by Zaki Khairi and others to form the Iraqi Communist Party, later renamed the People's Solidarity Party, has been rejected.

On the morning of January 9th, Mustafa Barzani and others first applied to establish the Kurdistan Democratic Party. Then, journalist Zaki Khairi and fourteen others, including workers, farmers, teachers, and doctors, applied to the Minister of Interior to establish the Iraqi Communist Party. Subsequently, others applied to establish the National Democratic Party. That same afternoon, Daoud Sayyigh, a traitor expelled from the Iraqi Communist Party and owner of the Baghdad newspaper "Al-Mabda," also applied to establish a political party called the "Iraqi Communist Party." The "People's Solidarity Newspaper" pointed out on January 12th that Sayyigh had been expelled from the Iraqi Communist Party in 1943 for engaging in divisive activities. He then gathered some opportunists to form a "League of Communists" to continue his sabotage. In 1957, he wrote a false self-criticism and rejoined the Party. In the latter half of 1959, when enemies at home and abroad were clamoring to "fight against communism," Sayyigh gathered some rebellious elements and resumed his destructive activities. He published "Al-Mabda" as a tool for sabotage. The Iraqi Communist Party expelled him from the Party again.

According to the Associations Law and the Political Parties Law, if the Minister of Interior does not raise any objections or request any modifications within thirty days after receiving an application for a political party, the party is considered to have been granted permission to conduct public activities.

By February 9th, the National Democratic Party and the Kurdistan Democratic Party had not received any comments from the Minister of Interior. The Minister of Interior also did not raise any objections to Sayyigh's application. However, on February 6th, the Minister of Interior wrote to Zaki Khairi and others, raising some objections, including requesting the deletion of the word "revolution" in two places and requesting an explanation of the meaning of "Marxism-Leninism." Zaki Khairi and others immediately responded to the various questions raised by the Minister of Interior.

Subsequently, the communists led by Zaki Khairi applied to the Minister of Interior to rename their originally applied for Iraqi Communist Party to the People's Solidarity Party. The Baghdad "People's Solidarity Newspaper" published an article by Zaki Khairi on February 16th, stating that the applicants decided to change the name of the party only to avoid further obstacles in the event of two parties with the same name. He pointed out that the change of the party's name "does not mean a change in the party's program and constitution," nor does it mean that the party has changed its attitude towards Sayyigh's opportunist sabotage group.

On February 23rd, Iraqi Minister of Interior Yahya wrote a letter notifying Zaki Khairi and others that their application to establish the People's Solidarity Party had been rejected. The main reasons cited in the letter for refusing approval included: "Since another political party has already been established under the name of the Iraqi Communist Party, it is impossible to organize a political party under the same name";
	"The goals and objectives stated in the program and constitution you submitted are the same or almost exactly the same as those of the already established Iraqi Communist Party. Therefore, it is not in accordance with legal principles to organize your party when there is already another party similar to it."

Earlier, all political parties had published their party programs and constitutions in the newspapers.

The constitution of the Iraqi Communist Party, originally applied for by Zaki Khairi and other communists and later renamed the People's Solidarity Party, states that the Iraqi Communist Party is the organized fighting vanguard of the Iraqi working class. This vanguard believes that the worker-peasant alliance is the cornerstone of the united struggle of anti-imperialist and anti-feudal classes and the solidarity of all patriotic and democratic forces. Its goals, systems, and policies are guided by Marxism-Leninism based on the objective conditions of Iraq and the characteristics and foundations of national society. It is committed to defending the Republic of Iraq, consolidating national independence, and realizing the democratic rights of the people, believing in and working for the solidarity of the working class and progressive humanity against imperialism and exploitation throughout the world, and striving for democracy and socialism. The party's national program states that the Iraqi Communist Party struggles to complete the tasks of the July 14, 1958, revolution. As a liberating and democratic revolution, its main tasks are: to eliminate the forces of imperialism and the remnants of its exploitation, to make the country's independence complete and strengthened, to eliminate feudalism and its remnants in the countryside, to distribute land to the peasants, to realize national industrialization, to open democratic freedom to the people, and to improve the people's living standards, health, and culture. The party determines these tasks based on the revolutionary nature, the conditions of Iraq, and social characteristics, and is guided by the principles of scientific socialism. The realization of these tasks is not for the benefit of one class but is in the interests of all patriotic classes of the people. The program points out that the contradictions and differences between the various classes and strata of Iraqi society are secondary compared to the actual contradictions between the revolutionary forces and their hostile forces. The program emphasizes the necessity of cooperation and the establishment of a national united front by all patriotic classes and forces of workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie.

The program of the National Democratic Party, signed by the current Minister of Finance Muhammad Hadid and others who applied for its establishment, states that the party is committed to maintaining the regime of the Republic of Iraq and consolidating its sovereignty and independence. Its purpose is to establish a parliamentary democratic representative system. In the economic field, the party advocates protecting and strengthening national industry and using national and private capital to serve the national economy. The party advocates pursuing a policy of active neutrality.

The signatories of the application to establish the Kurdistan Democratic Party include Mustafa Barzani and Ibrahim Ahmad, editor of the "Steadfast Newspaper." The party's program states that it struggles for the Kurdish people of Iraq to obtain representation and positions in all state organs and official and semi-official institutions. It struggles to expand and strengthen the republic's democratic policies on a guided democratic basis. The party stated that it will strengthen friendly and cooperative relations with the Iraqi Communist Party, the National Democratic Party, and various progressive democratic organizations in Iraq, and stated that it advocates pursuing a national policy against imperialism.

### 伊拉克政局的动向  共产主义者扎基·赫里申请成立政党遭到拒绝  伊共叛徒萨耶格的“伊拉克共产党”得到批准

    伊拉克政局的动向
    共产主义者扎基·赫里申请成立政党遭到拒绝
    伊共叛徒萨耶格的“伊拉克共产党”得到批准
    新华社24讯　巴格达消息：自从伊拉克官方宣告“过渡时期”在1月6日结束以来，申请成立的国家民主党、库尔德斯坦民主党已经获得许可进行活动，但是扎基·赫里等人申请成立伊拉克共产党后来改名为人民团结党的要求遭到拒绝。
    1月9日上午，穆斯塔法·巴尔扎尼等首先申请成立库尔德斯坦民主党。接着，新闻工作者扎基·赫里和包括工人、农民、教师和医生在内的其他十四人向内政部长申请成立伊拉克共产党。随后还有人申请成立国家民主党。当天下午，被伊拉克共产党开除的叛党分子、巴格达“原则报”所有者达乌德·萨耶格竟也申请成立一个叫做“伊拉克共产党”的政党。“人民团结报”曾经在1月12日指出，萨耶格在1943年因从事分裂活动而被开除出伊拉克共产党。他随后集结一些机会主义分子组织了一个“共产主义者同盟”，继续进行破坏活动。到1957年，他写了一份假检讨又混入党内。1959年下半年，当国内外敌人都叫嚣“要同共产主义作战”的时候，萨耶格纠集一些叛党分子，又恢复了他的破坏活动。他出版了“原则报”作为破坏活动的工具。于是伊拉克共产党再次把他开除出党。
    根据结社法和政党法，如果内政部长在接到一个政党的申请书以后，三十天内没有提出任何反对意见或要求修改的意见，那么这个政党就被认为获得许可进行公开活动。
    到2月9日，国家民主党和库尔德斯坦民主党没有收到内政部长的任何意见。内政部长对萨耶格的申请也没有提出任何意见。但是内政部长在2月6日写信给扎基·赫里等提出了一些意见，其中包括要求在两个地方删去“革命”字样，要求对“马克思列宁主义”的含义提出解释等。扎基·赫里等立即对内政部长提出的各项问题给予答复。
    随后，以扎基·赫里为首的共产主义者向内政部长申请把他们原来申请建立的伊拉克共产党改名为人民团结党。巴格达“人民团结报”2月16日刊载扎基·赫里的一篇文章说，申请人决定改变党的名称只是为了在存在两个相同名称的政党的时候不致产生更多的障碍。他指出，党的名称的改变“绝不意味着党纲党章的改变”，也不意味着党改变它对萨耶格机会主义破坏集团的态度。
    2月23日，伊拉克内政部长叶海亚写信通知扎基·赫里等，他们申请成立人民团结党的要求已被拒绝。信中举出的拒绝批准的主要理由包括：“由于另一个政党已经用伊拉克共产党的名称成立，因此就不可能用同一个名称组织政党”；
  “在你所提出的纲领和党章中所说明的目标和宗旨，同已经成立的伊拉克共产党的目标相同或者几乎完全相同，因此在已经有了另一个类似它的政党的时候，组织你党是不符合法律原则的。”
    早些时候，各政党都曾经在报纸上发表了党的纲领和党章。
    扎基·赫里等共产主义者申请成立的原称伊拉克共产党、后来改称人民团结党的党章说，伊拉克共产党是伊拉克工人阶级有组织的战斗先锋队。这个先锋队认为工农联盟是反帝反封建阶级统一斗争和一切爱国民主力量团结的基石。它的目标、制度和政策是以伊拉克的客观情况和民族社会特点和基础、以马克思列宁主义为指导的。它致力于捍卫伊拉克共和国，巩固民族独立和实现人民的民主权利，相信并致力于全世界工人阶级和反帝反剥削的进步人类的团结，争取民主和社会主义。这个党的民族纲领说，伊拉克共产党为完成1958年7月14日的革命的任务而斗争。这个革命作为一个解放的民主的革命，它的主要任务是：肃清帝国主义势力及其剥削的残余，使国家的独立达到完备和得到加强，肃清封建及其在农村中的残余，把土地分给农民，实现国家工业化，给人民开放民主自由，提高人民的生活、健康和文化水平。党确定这些任务是以革命性质、伊拉克的条件和社会特点为依据，并且是以科学的社会主义原则为指导的。实现这些任务，并不是为了一个阶级的利益而是符合所有人民爱国阶级的利益的。纲领指出，伊拉克社会各阶级和阶层之间的矛盾和分歧，同存在于革命力量和它的敌对力量之间实际存在的矛盾比较起来，是次要的。纲领强调了工人、农民、小资产阶级和民族资产阶级各爱国阶级和力量通力合作和建立民族统一阵线的必要性。
    由现任财政部长穆罕默德·哈迪德等签署申请成立的国家民主党的党纲说，这个党致力于维护伊拉克共和国政权、巩固它的主权和独立。它的目的在于建立一种议会民主代议制度。在经济方面，这个党主张保护和加强民族工业，利用民族资本和私人资本为国民经济服务。这个党主张奉行积极中立政策。
    申请成立库尔德斯坦民主党的签署者包括穆斯塔法·巴尔扎尼和“坚定报”主编易卜拉欣·艾哈迈德等。这个党的党纲说，它为伊拉克库尔德族人民在一切国家机关以及官方和半官方机构中获得代表权和任职权而斗争。它为在有领导的民主基础上扩大和加强共和国的民主方针而斗争。这个党表示将加强同伊拉克共产党、国家民主党和伊拉克各进步民主组织的友爱和合作关系，并且表示主张奉行反对帝国主义的民族政策。
