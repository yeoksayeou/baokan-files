    Scientific Research Institutions, Universities, and Factories Engage in Extensive Collaboration
    Shanghai Intensively Tackles Cutting-Edge Science and Basic Theories
    Completed 16,000 Research Projects Last Year, Solving Many Major Technical Bottlenecks in Production

    (Our Dispatch) Shanghai achieved outstanding results in scientific research work in the continued Great Leap Forward year of 1959. According to incomplete statistics, scientific research institutions and universities throughout the city completed over 16,000 scientific research projects last year. The majority of the planned fifty-plus key research projects are already underway according to schedule. Last year's research achievements were not only numerous and of high quality, but were also rapidly applied to production. Many advanced and precision products, as well as major technical bottlenecks in production, were quickly resolved through the collaboration of scientific research institutions, universities, and factories.

    Starting at the beginning of last year, Shanghai's scientific research work, under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal Science and Technology Commission, made unified plans and deployments. To ensure the completion of major and cutting-edge projects, scientific and technical personnel from scientific research institutions, universities, and related factories jointly established nineteen professional groups and ninety-five thematic groups, engaging in extensive collaboration. Research projects that directly serve production and construction and urgently require accelerated completion for the development of science were given top priority, while also placing great emphasis on research in cutting-edge science and basic theory. The Municipal Science and Technology Association also successively established 167 professional collaboration groups in various districts and counties, vigorously carrying out mass scientific research activities. Combining this with the burgeoning technical innovation and technical revolution movement in factories, the association summarized more than 40 major industrial and agricultural production experiences, such as steel casting, rapeseed bumper harvests, and the prevention and control of pig asthma, accumulating over 3,270 technical materials and writing nearly 1,000 papers.

    Many scientific research works began to develop from the "point" breakthroughs of 1958 into the occupation of "lines" and "surfaces." Some research has even surpassed the previous stage of imitation and moved towards originality. This is one of the main characteristics of the continued leap forward in Shanghai's scientific research work last year. The problem of automatic rapid analysis of metals has always been a recognized difficulty in various countries. The Shanghai Materials Research Institute, based on the successful creation of a three-element (Type I) automatic rapid analyzer in 1958, further created a multi-functional nine-element (Type II) automatic rapid analyzer last year. It can complete more than 200 chemical analysis processes in eight minutes, rapidly and accurately determining the composition and properties of pig iron, carbon steel, and low alloy steel. The manufacture of marine diesel engines was previously a "blank spot" in China's industry. In 1958, the Fourth Research Office of the Shanghai Shipbuilding Product Design Institute, with the assistance of factories, designed and trial-produced the first 2,000-horsepower marine diesel engine in four months. In 1959, they continued to successfully complete the design work for an 8,820-horsepower marine diesel engine. Through the research and design of these two diesel engines, they are now able to design diesel engines of different power ratings according to the needs of different ship types, providing options for the selection of main engines for shipbuilding.

    Another feature of the leap forward in scientific research work last year was that research units, universities, and factories, or research units, related factories, and user units, carried out collaboration, fiercely attacking major and cutting-edge products and jointly solving major technical bottlenecks in production, enabling Shanghai's industrial production to "reach a new level" in the continued Great Leap Forward. Many advanced and precision products that were previously considered unattainable were trial-produced in the great collaboration. For example, steroid hormones, a cutting-edge product in the pharmaceutical industry, were originally listed by pharmaceutical industrial departments as a product to be trial-produced only in the Third Five-Year Plan due to the complexity of the manufacturing technology. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Institute of Organic Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry, and the General Pharmaceutical Factory collaborated to successfully trial-produce ten kinds of steroid hormone drugs in more than a year. Among them, the synthesis steps of "cortisone" were improved from the 12-14 steps commonly used in various countries to seven steps. The coaxial communication cable successfully researched and manufactured by the Shanghai Cable Research Institute and the Shanghai Cable Factory can simultaneously carry 1,800 lines and is an essential material for communication and color television in large and medium-sized cities. Other collaborative products that represent a significant improvement in China's scientific level include the successfully trial-produced small general-purpose electronic computer, the "magnetic drum" that plays a "memory" role in electronic computing, microwave rangefinders, and microbalances with a sensitivity of one-millionth of a gram.

    In the field of theoretical science, 1959 also saw a rich harvest. The research units of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai alone presented 280 papers at the academic report meeting held around National Day last year, many of which were of high scientific level. Through in-depth investigation in the countryside and summarizing the experiences of high yields of crops such as rice, wheat, cotton, and rapeseed, the Institute of Plant Physiology proposed a new research direction for plant population physiology, which was not previously mentioned in plant physiology. The Institute of Physiology's research on acupuncture and qigong in traditional Chinese medicine, and the Institute of Biochemistry's research on artificial synthesis of proteins, have made new progress last year.

    科学研究机关、高等院校、工厂大搞协作
    上海猛攻尖端科学和基本理论
    去年一年完成一万六千项研究项目，解决许多生产中的重大技术关键问题
    本报讯　上海科学研究工作在继续大跃进的1959年取得了优异的成绩。据不完全统计，全市科学研究机关、高等学校去年一年间完成的科学研究项目有一万六千项以上。预定的五十多个重点研究项目，绝大部分都已按计划进行。去年研究成果不仅数量多、质量高，而且推广应用于生产快，以及许多高级、精密的产品和生产中的重大技术关键问题，在科学研究机关、高等学校和工厂三方面协作下迅速得到解决。
    从去年年初开始，上海科学研究工作就在中共上海市委和市的科学技术委员会领导下，作了统一规划和部署。为保证重大、尖端课题的完成，全市科学研究机关、高等学校和有关工厂的科学技术人员共同成立了十九个专业组和九十五个专题组，大搞协作，把直接为生产建设服务和发展科学事业迫切需要提前完成的研究项目放在首要地位，同时十分重视对尖端科学和基本理论方面的研究。市的科学技术协会也相继在各区、县建立了一百六十七个专业协作组，大力开展群众性的科学研究活动，并结合工厂中蓬勃发展的技术革新和技术革命运动，总结了铸钢、油菜丰收、防治猪气喘病等四十多项重大工农业生产经验，积累三千二百七十多种技术资料，写出近千篇论文。
    许多科学研究工作开始从1958年“点”的突破，发展成为“线”和“面”的占领，某些研究并已越过以往的仿制阶段走向独创，这是上海科学研究工作去年继续跃进的主要特征之一。金属的自动特快分析问题，一直是世界各国公认的难题。上海材料研究所在1958年创制成功三元素（Ⅰ型）自动特快分析仪的基础上，去年又进一步创制成功复能式九元素（Ⅱ型）自动特快分析仪，它能在八分钟内完成二百多道化学分析工序，迅速正确地断定生铁、碳钢、低合金钢的成分及其性能。船用柴油机的制造，以往是我国工业中的“空白点”。1958年，上海船舶产品设计院第四室在工厂的协助下，以四个月时间设计并试制成功第一台二千马力船用柴油机，1959年，又继续顺利地完成了八千八百二十大马力船用柴油机的设计工作。并且通过这两台柴油机的研究和设计，现在他们已能根据不同船型的需要，设计不同功率的柴油机，提供制造船舶主机选用。
    去年科学研究工作跃进的另一个特点是，研究单位、高等学校和工厂，或是研究单位、有关工厂和使用单位三方面开展协作，猛攻重大、尖端产品和共同解决生产中的重大技术关键问题，使上海工业生产在继续大跃进中“更上一层楼”。许多过去不敢问津的高级、精密产品，在大协作中试制出来。例如医药工业中的尖端产品——甾体激素，因为制造技术复杂，制药工业部门曾列为第三个五年计划才开始试制的产品之一。1958年大跃进中，中国科学院有机化学研究所、医药工业研究所和通用制药厂等单位共同协作，一年多时间里就试制成功十种甾体激素药物，其中“可的松”的合成步骤由世界各国通用的十二——十四步改进为七步。上海电缆所和上海电缆厂紧密协作研究制造成功的同轴通讯电缆，能同时通一千八百条线路，是大、中城市通讯和五彩电视的必备材料。其他如试制成功的小型通用电子计算机，在电子计算中起“记忆”作用的“磁鼓”，微波测距仪，百万分之一克的微量天平等，也都是代表着我国科学水平显著提高的协作产物。
    在理论科学方面，1959年也同样获得丰收。仅是中国科学院在上海的研究单位在去年国庆前后举行的学术报告会上，共提出二百八十篇论文，其中很多具有较高的科学水平。植物生理研究所通过深入农村总结水稻、小麦、棉花、油菜等作物的丰产经验中，提出植物群体生理新的研究方向，是过去植物生理学中所没有提到过的。生理研究所关于祖国医学中针灸、气功的研究，生物化学所关于蛋白质人工合成等问题的研究，去年都有新的进展。（高洁）
