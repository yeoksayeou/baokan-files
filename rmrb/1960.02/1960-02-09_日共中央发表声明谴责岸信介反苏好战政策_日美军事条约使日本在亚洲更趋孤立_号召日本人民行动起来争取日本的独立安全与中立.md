Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th -- The Central Committee Cadre Council of the Japanese Communist Party published a statement in the "Akahata" today, strongly condemning the anti-Soviet, warmongering policies of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

The statement pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have been inciting xenophobic, anti-Soviet sentiments in their reply to the Soviet memorandum in recent days and in the resolution "requesting the Diet to protest to the Soviet Union." This is an attempt to divert the attention of the Japanese people, who are increasingly dissatisfied and indignant at the conclusion of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," to split the democratic forces that have united and launched a struggle for more than a year to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty," and to force the Japanese people to accept the aggressive U.S.-Japan military alliance.

In its statement, the Japanese Communist Party expressed its active support for the memorandum submitted by the Soviet government to the Japanese government regarding the conclusion of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. The statement said that this memorandum is based on the spirit of maintaining peace in the Far East and is entirely in line with the Japanese people's desire for the withdrawal of U.S. troops and the dismantling of U.S. military bases, as well as the interests of the Japanese nation.

The statement pointed out that the xenophobic and warmongering attitude adopted by the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party is completely contrary to the wishes of the Japanese people, who long for peace and friendship with all countries.

The statement pointed out that the new "Security Treaty" is an aggressive anti-communist military alliance similar to the anti-communist military alliance of the Axis powers (Japan, Germany, and Italy) and is also a blatant conspiracy to revive Japanese militarism.

The statement pointed out that Japan had previously declared in the one-sided Treaty of San Francisco and international agreements that it had renounced the Kuril Islands, including Habomai and Shikotan Islands. Despite this, the Soviet Union, taking into account Japan's interests, agreed in the Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration to hand over the Habomai and Shikotan Islands to Japan on the condition that a Japan-Soviet peace treaty be concluded. The statement condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government for not only disregarding the repeated suggestions of the Soviet government and refusing to conclude a Japan-Soviet peace treaty, but also concluding a new "Security Treaty" with the United States, creating a new situation completely different from the time of the Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration.

The statement pointed out that under the current circumstances, if the Soviet Union handed over the Habomai and Shikotan Islands to Japan, U.S. military bases in Japan would further increase, and a powder keg for launching a new war would be added to the north of Japan, which could only threaten Japan's peace and security.

The statement pointed out that after the Japan-China relations fell into a stalemate, the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet concluded an aggressive military alliance treaty targeting the Soviet Union and China, which created a new crisis in Japan-Soviet relations. This deepened Japan's tendency to be isolated among Asian countries, made Japan's international situation more difficult, and further added to Japan's difficulties in politics and economics.

The Japanese Communist Party called on all democratic forces and all Japanese people who yearn for peace, independence, and democracy to unite, to fight against the chauvinistic and warmongering propaganda of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party, and to strive for Japan's true independence, peace, security, and neutrality by opposing the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

The statement emphasized that, to this end, the most important thing is to launch a vigorous struggle to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" and to strive for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China and the conclusion of a Japan-Soviet peace treaty. The unity and solidarity of the democratic forces is the most reliable foundation for the victory of this struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th -- The Japan Socialist Party, the largest opposition party in Japan, decided today to oppose the Liberal Democratic Party's "resolution requesting the Diet to protest to the Soviet Union" submitted to the Diet.

In this resolution, the Liberal Democratic Party slandered the Soviet Union's righteous action of condemning the Japanese government for signing a military alliance with the United States in its memorandum to Japan on January 27, and demanded that the opposition parties support the Diet in passing this proposal.

The Japan Socialist Party Diet Countermeasures Committee pointed out in its decision that it is not necessary for the Diet to pass such a proposal. Otherwise, it will further worsen the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union.

The Socialist Party also decided to oppose Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama's explanation of the newly signed U.S.-Japan "Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security" in the Diet tomorrow. It believes that this explanation should be given after the current deliberations on this treaty by the Budget Committee have ended.

The Socialist Party also decided to demand that the ruling party agree to establish a special committee in both houses of the Diet to carefully discuss this new treaty.

### 日共中央发表声明谴责岸信介反苏好战政策  日美军事条约使日本在亚洲更趋孤立  号召日本人民行动起来争取日本的独立安全与中立

    日共中央发表声明谴责岸信介反苏好战政策
    日美军事条约使日本在亚洲更趋孤立
    号召日本人民行动起来争取日本的独立安全与中立
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会干部会今天在“赤旗报”上发表声明，强烈谴责岸信介内阁的反苏、好战的政策。
    声明指出，岸信介内阁和执政的自由民主党这几天在对苏联备忘录的答复中和在“要求国会对苏联提出抗议”的决议案中煽动排外、反苏情绪，是企图转移对日美签订新“安全条约”日益强烈不满和愤慨的日本人民的注意力，分裂一年多来为阻止修改“安全条约”而团结起来展开斗争的民主力量，强使日本人民接受侵略性的日美军事同盟。
    日共在声明中表示积极支持苏联政府就日美缔结军事同盟条约向日本政府提出的备忘录。声明说，因为这项备忘录是以维护远东和平的精神为基础的，而且完全符合日本人民要求撤出美军和撤销美军基地的愿望和日本民族的利益。
    声明指出，岸信介内阁和自由民主党所采取的排外、好战的态度，完全同渴望和平和同各国友好的日本人民的意愿相违背的。
    声明指出，新“安全条约”是类似日、德、意三国反共军事同盟的侵略性反共军事同盟，同时也是公然复活日本军国主义的阴谋。
    声明指出，日本曾经在片面的旧金山和约和国际协定中宣布过放弃包括齿舞群岛和色丹岛在内的千岛群岛。尽管这样，苏联考虑到日本的利益，在日苏联合宣言中以缔结日苏和约为条件答应把齿舞群岛和色丹岛移交给日本。声明谴责岸信介政府不仅不顾苏联政府多次的建议，拒绝缔结日苏和约，而且还同美国缔结新的“安全条约”，造成了同发表日苏联合宣言时完全不同的新局势。
    声明指出，在目前情况下，如果苏联把齿舞群岛和色丹岛移交日本，美军设在日本的基地就将进一步增加，日本的北边就会增添一个发动新战争的火药库，这只能是对日本的和平和安全的威胁。
    声明指出，在日中关系陷入僵局以后，由于岸信介内阁缔结以苏中两国为目标的侵略性军事同盟条约，在日苏关系上又形成了新的危机。这加深了日本在亚洲各国中间孤立的倾向，并且使日本在国际上的处境愈加困难，进一步为日本在政治和经济上增添了困难。
    日共号召全体民主力量和渴望和平、独立、民主的一切日本人民团结起来，同岸信介内阁和自由民主党这种煽动沙文主义和好战的宣传展开斗争、并且为反对批准新“安全条约”以及为争取日本真正的独立与和平、安全、中立而奋斗。
    声明强调指出，为此，最重要的是：展开有力的阻止批准新“安全条约”的斗争和争取恢复日中邦交、缔结日苏和约的运动。民主力量的统一和团结是使这个斗争取得胜利的最可靠的基础。
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本最大的在野党社会党今天决定反对自由民主党向国会提出的“要求国会对苏联提出抗议的决议案”。
    自由民主党在这项决议案中，对苏联在1月27日给日本的备忘录中谴责日本政府同美国签订军事同盟的正义行动进行诬蔑，并且要求在野党支持国会通过这个提案。
    社会党国会对策委员会在决定中指出，国会没有必要通过这样的提案。否则它将会使日本同苏联的关系进一步恶化。
    社会党还决定反对日本外务相藤山爱一郎明天在国会上解释新签订的日美“共同合作和安全条约”。它认为，这种解释应当在预算委员会目前关于这个条约的审议结束以后再进行。
    社会党并且决定要求执政党同意在国会两院设立特别委员会，来仔细讨论这个新条约。
