Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 30th -- The 34th regular session of the Japanese Diet officially reconvened this afternoon after the New Year holidays. In this Diet session, scheduled to adjourn on May 26th, the issue of whether to ratify the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" will be the center of the struggle between Japanese democratic forces and the Nobusuke Kishi group.

Today's meeting did not begin substantive discussions. After the reconvening ceremony was held in the House of Councillors, the House of Representatives held a plenary session, approving the resignation of the Vice-Speaker of the House of Representatives, Kiyoshi Masaki, and electing Koichi Nakamura of the Socialist Party as Vice-Speaker.

Masaki Kiyoshi submitted his resignation during the extraordinary Diet session in December last year. He took this action to protest the Nobusuke Kishi group's actions during the extraordinary Diet session of violating the constitution and forcibly passing various reactionary bills.

In order to suppress the increasingly high tide of mass movements opposing the "Security Treaty," the Nobusuke Kishi group also attempted to force this Diet session to approve a reactionary bill prohibiting people from demonstrating and marching around the Diet.

This session will discuss the national budget for the current year. In this budget, the Nobusuke Kishi government plans to allocate 154.6 billion yen for military expenditures to develop Japan's military strength, and 594.1 billion yen to subsidize monopoly capital for development and economic expansion abroad.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 31st -- Under strong pressure from the opposition parties, the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Japanese Diet, Ryogoro Kato of the Liberal Democratic Party, was forced to announce his resignation today.

At a meeting chaired by this Liberal Democratic Party speaker at the end of last year, Liberal Democratic Party members of the Japanese House of Representatives, taking advantage of the opposition party members' refusal to attend the meeting, unilaterally passed a reactionary law prohibiting people from holding demonstrations and marches around the Diet. Kato had also instructed the House of Representatives Disciplinary Committee to "punish" Inejiro Asanuma and four other Socialist Party members of the House of Representatives. The Liberal Democratic Party stubbornly claimed that the chaos caused by the police beating the masses who petitioned the Diet in November against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" was caused by Asanuma and others, attempting to attack the mass movement opposing the revision of the "Security Treaty" by "punishing" Asanuma and others.

    日本国会平时会议复会
    是否批准“安全条约”问题是斗争中心
    执政党的众议院议长被迫辞职
    据新华社30日讯　东京消息：日本第三十四次国会平时会议在结束了新年休假以后于今天下午正式复会。在预定5月26日闭幕的这次国会会议中，是否批准新的日美“安全条约”问题将是日本民主力量同岸信介集团之间斗争的中心。
    今天的会议没有开始进行实质性的讨论。复会仪式在参议院举行以后，众议院举行全体会议，批准了众议院副议长正木清辞职，选出社会党的中村高一担任副议长。
    正木清是在去年12月国会临时会议上提出辞职的。他采取这个行动是为了抗议岸信介集团在国会临时会议期间破坏宪法强行通过各种反动法案的行为。
    为了镇压日益高涨的反对“安全条约”的群众运动，岸信介集团还企图强使这次国会会议批准禁止人民在国会周围示威游行的反动法案。
    这次会议将讨论本年度的国家预算。在这项预算中，岸信介政府准备拨出军费一千五百四十六亿日元来发展日本军事力量，并且拨出五千九百四十一亿日元来资助垄断资本发展并向国外进行经济扩张。
    据新华社31日讯　东京消息：日本国会众议院议长、自由民主党的加藤镣五郎在反对党的强烈要求下，今天被迫宣布辞职。
    日本众议院的自由民主党议员在这位自由民主党的议长于去年年底主持的一次会议上，利用反对党议员拒绝出席会议的机会，单独通过了禁止人民在国会周围举行示威游行的反动法律。加藤还曾经指使众议院惩罚委员会“惩罚”浅沼稻次郎等四位社会党众议员。自由民主党硬把去年11月警察殴打为反对修改日美“安全条约”向国会请愿的群众而造成的混乱说是浅沼等人引起的，企图通过对浅沼等人的“惩罚”，来打击反对修改“安全条约”的群众运动。
