    Simplified Slogans

    In meetings or documents, one often hears and sees some simplified slogans, such as "One Main," "Three Self-Sufficiencies," "Five No's," and so on. For the sake of convenience in speaking and writing, and to reduce tediousness, doing so is permissible. However, it is best to use them appropriately according to the circumstances. If, when proposing a slogan, it is estimated that everyone is already very familiar with this simplified slogan, then it can be simplified; if it is estimated that everyone is not very familiar with it, then it is best not to simplify it arbitrarily.

    Recently, I saw the following passage in a document: "In water conservancy construction, each commune must conscientiously implement the 'Three Main' principles, promote the 'Five Self' and 'One -ization' experiences, vigorously promote high-efficiency movement, ..." What do the "Three Main," "Five Self," and "One -ization" actually include? The entire text does not mention it before or after. In this way, for those who do not understand them, it will not play a role in guiding the work, and the work will suffer losses.

### 简化了的口号

    简化了的口号
    在会议上或文件里，常听到、看到一些简化了的口号，如“一主”“三自给”“五不要”等等。为了发言、书写的简便，减少繁琐，这样做也是可以的。但是最好分别情况适当运用。如果在提口号时，估计大家对这简化了的口号已很熟悉，那么可以简化；如果估计大家不太熟悉时，那就最好不要随意简化。
    最近我在一份文件里，看到这样一段话：“各公社在水利建设中要认真贯彻执行“三主”方针，推广“五自”“一化”经验，大搞高工效运动，……”这里的“三主”“五自”“一化”究竟包含什么，全文的前后都没有提及。这样，对于不了解它们的人，就起不到指导工作的作用，使工作遭受损失了。
