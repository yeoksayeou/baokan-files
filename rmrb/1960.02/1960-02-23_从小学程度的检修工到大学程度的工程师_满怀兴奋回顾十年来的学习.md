    From Elementary School-Level Repairman to University-Level Engineer
    Excitedly Reviewing Ten Years of Learning
    Chen Hongming, Director of the Lüda Aquatic Product Processing Factory, Model Student of the Dalian Institute of Technology Night School

    In the old society, I was a poor worker who had only attended one year of private school and four years of elementary school. After liberation, we, the slaves of the old society, became masters of the new society. The Party continuously educated me and cultivated me, enabling me to take on a leadership role in a state-owned enterprise. Schools that only the children of wealthy people could enter in the old society were opened to cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds after liberation. For ten years, the Party has always cared for and supported my studies, enabling me to improve from an elementary school level to a university level. Due to the improvement of my cultural level and work ability, in 1954 I gloriously obtained the title of engineer granted by the state. When I think of the difficult years of the past and the Party's cultivation and education, I am filled with countless emotions. Without the Party, I would not be where I am today; without the Party, I would not have received any honors. Here, I sincerely thank the Party and Chairman Mao.
    I was born into a poor peasant family and lived a life worse than that of beasts of burden. I could only watch the children of wealthy families go to school and study. It was truly difficult for poor children to study. The school was far from home. Others boarded at the school, but I could only nibble on moldy bran and vegetables. I couldn't afford paper, so I always practiced writing on leaves with grass roots first. Later, the rural economy further collapsed, and I lost the opportunity to continue my studies. At the age of seventeen, I went to Dalian as an apprentice. At that time, I was amazed to see people drawing blueprints and hearing them talk about the differences between screws in inches and fractions of inches. I vaguely felt that technology was not simple and was a secure means of livelihood. I secretly resolved to learn technology. I bought a "Fitter's Handbook" and went to a master craftsman's home after work. Those tables and formulas, no matter how much I looked at them, I couldn't understand. When I asked the master craftsman, he couldn't answer because he was illiterate. Later, I taught him to read, and he told me about technology that he couldn't explain logically. My determination to learn technology was just a pitiful dream in that era.
    After liberation, the workers became the masters of the country, and the Party continuously educated us to cherish our factories. At that time, I was a repairman. When a machine broke down, I had to find the cause; I had to think of ways to maintain it; and the leaders often asked me to study technical problems. My cultural level was too low, and I encountered many difficulties in my work. Take reading blueprints, for example. I could get a general idea based on experience, but I couldn't understand the structure and principle of the object, let alone discover the problems in it. As for the theoretical problems encountered in the work, I only knew how it was done but not why. All these facts made me understand that to occupy the position of technical knowledge, I must first conquer the fortress of culture and science. Under the guidance of this idea, I began to study cultural courses on my own in 1949. After 1950, the Party established various forms of spare-time schools for us, and I have always been a student in these schools. I remember when I first stepped into the gate of the spare-time school, I was overwhelmed with emotions. The old society did not give me the opportunity to study, but the Party created the conditions for me to learn. I deeply felt that carrying a schoolbag into the classroom was not a trivial matter; it embodied the Party's cultivation and expectations.
    At this time, the Party promoted me to be the workshop director and factory director. A worker who had no status in the old society became a leading backbone of a state-owned enterprise in the new society. This was truly an earth-shaking change. Whenever I think of this, I always feel that the work I have done for the Party is still too little, and what I know is still far from meeting the needs of the work. Can I fail the Party's trust? No, never! The heavier the work responsibility, the more I feel the importance of learning, and the more stubbornly I persist in learning. I learned enterprise management experience from Soviet comrades, I learned production technology knowledge from workers and technicians, and I persisted in systematic cultural learning in spare-time schools for many years. Learning has increased my knowledge. When technicians send over a blueprint again, I am no longer confused by those lines and can review and modify them. Usually, I often study production technology with the workers and use theory to solve some practical problems. Learning has promoted the work, and in turn, it has strengthened my confidence and determination in learning. I deeply feel that learning - work - learning is a mutually reinforcing and infinitely repeating process. In this process, the Party gave me enthusiastic encouragement and great support. Every time the city leaders came to the factory, they would ask about my learning situation. Whenever there was a class in the evening, the factory Party organization always tried to help me get away from my busy work. If there was work, other comrades would take the initiative to help me do it. Without the Party's care and support, it would be unimaginable to persist in learning for several years.
    I have not interrupted my studies for nearly ten years, from 1950 to the present. At first, I studied junior high school physics at the Lüda Correspondence School. Later, when this school no longer enrolled students in the city, I transferred to the district-run spare-time middle school to continue my studies. Soon after, this school was discontinued, and I transferred to the Dalian No. 4 Middle School spare-time middle school to study junior high school Chinese and mathematics. In 1955, in order to apply for high school, I completed the junior high school chemistry in a concentrated period of study with the help of technicians in the factory. In the same year, I was admitted to the high school class of the night school attached to the Dalian Institute of Technology. Since 1957, I have been studying university courses in the undergraduate program. In the process of learning, I have encountered many difficulties. These difficulties have been overcome with the help of the factory organization and school teachers. Carrying out leadership work, I often have to attend various meetings convened by the city. In order not to affect listening to lectures, I always carry the textbooks and notes that I will use that night with me. When there is a drawing class, my bag is full, and I have to carry a roll of drawings. After the meeting, I immediately rush to the school to listen to the lecture. If I don't have time to eat, I nibble on some dry food prepared in advance during the break. City meetings sometimes do not end until seven or eight o'clock. Even if there is only one class left after the meeting, I have to go to school. I will listen to as much as I can. After class, when everyone goes home, I stay and ask the teacher to make up the lesson. I have never been absent for ten years because the meeting ended late. The biggest difficulty I encountered in my studies was frequent business trips. In the first half of 1959, I had to go on business trips four times, one of which lasted as long as two weeks. After a business trip, I always tried to make up the lessons while continuing to study the new lessons. The first time I listened to the lecture, I understood almost nothing. But even if I didn't understand, I had to listen and take notes. Listening to lectures like this is very boring. I always forced myself to concentrate on listening to the end. After listening to it once, I will always have some impressions. After class, I would look at the textbook, bit by bit, and chew it carefully. The impression will be clearer and deeper. If I really can't solve the problem, I will write it down and ask the teacher again when I listen to the second lecture. In this way, I can understand half of the second lecture, and I can catch up with the team in the third lecture. When I encounter this situation, I think the most important thing is not to open the back door for myself and leave a way out. I must work hard and catch up, otherwise I will be farther and farther away, and finally I will have to interrupt my studies. When I first entered the university, I underestimated the complexity of the courses and rarely reviewed or did homework outside of class. The first time I took the exam, I only got three points. Later, with the guidance of the teacher, I strengthened my review and homework outside of class. I was the only one in my factory studying university courses. When reviewing, I had no companions. To do a problem, I always had to think repeatedly and calculate repeatedly. Sometimes it took three or four hours to find a correct answer. Seeing three or four hours slip away, how could I not feel heartache? But I think the solution to difficult problems should be like warriors capturing the enemy's fortresses, calm, firm, and unyielding. And when, after a period of intense thought, I finally solved a difficult problem, even though I am an old man, I am so happy that I want to jump up. Due to the strengthening of extracurricular review and homework, I achieved a score of five in the final exam of advanced mathematics. When participating in spare-time learning, time is always the most difficult to guarantee. Especially when I am in a leadership position, not only can I not take time off during work hours, but even the evenings without classes are filled with various meetings or activities. I have always used my lunch break time and other political theory study time determined by the organization to read newspapers and study political theory. What should I do? There is only one way to rationally arrange my personal life. I get up very early every morning. After eating breakfast, there is still more than an hour before work. I use this time to study on my own. Although it is late at night after class every day, I still have to review what I learned that day before going to bed. Then go to sleep. On Sundays, I squeeze out an entire morning to study on my own by compressing the time to deal with personal life trivial matters. I think the most important thing in participating in spare-time learning is to persist for a long time and develop a habit. Although there is only one hour every morning, if you persist for a long time, you can accumulate two or three hundred hours in a semester, which is equivalent to the total teaching hours of three semesters in colleges and universities. In the process of learning, I think it is also necessary to continuously fight against the negative factors in my thinking. My health is not good, and I often have to lie down to read. I have also had thoughts like this: I am old, my body is getting weaker day by day, and I have achieved certain results in learning, so let's just quit. But then I thought: If I want to give up learning today, will I still want to give up work tomorrow? Learning is for work, and it is also a task assigned to me by the Party. I have no right to give it up!
    For more than ten years, the Party has continuously educated me and cultivated me, which has improved my awareness and made me a glorious Communist Party member; made me grow from an ordinary worker to a leading cadre of a state-owned enterprise; gave me the opportunity to study, and achieved certain results. However, everything I have done is only the first step compared with the requirements of the Party and the needs of the rapidly developing socialist cause. As a Communist Party member, I am determined to follow the Party's instructions in future work and study, go all out, and work hard towards the goal of being both red and expert. I must persist in spare-time learning to the end, and constantly apply the knowledge I have learned to production work, and use greater and better achievements to answer the Party's care and cultivation for me, and answer everyone's trust and expectations in me.

    从小学程度的检修工到大学程度的工程师
    满怀兴奋回顾十年来的学习
    旅大市水产加工厂厂长  大连工学院夜校部模范学员  陈洪明
    在旧社会，我是一个穷苦的工人，只念过一年私塾和四年小学。解放后，我们这些旧社会的奴隶成了新社会的主人，党不断地教育我，培养我，使我走上了国家企业的领导岗位。旧社会只有财主的子弟们才进得去的学校，解放后为我们这些工农出身的干部敞开了大门。十年来，党始终关怀和支持我的学习，使我能够从小学程度提高到大学水平。由于文化水平和工作能力的提高，在1954年我光荣地获得了国家授予的工程师称号。当我想起过去的艰难岁月，想起党的培养教育，真是千言万语，百感交集。没有党，我不会有今天；没有党，我不会获得任何荣誉。在这里，我衷心地感谢党，衷心感谢毛主席。
    我出身在一个贫苦农民的家庭，从小过着牛马不如的生活，只能眼睁睁地看着有钱人家的孩子上学念书。那时我哥哥在外做工，由于他的接济，十二岁以后才有机会念了一年私塾和四年小学。穷人家的孩子念书，真有说不尽的艰难。学校离家远，人家在学校搭伙，我只能啃两口发了霉的糠菜；买不起纸，总是先用草根在树叶上练字。以后，农村经济进一步破产，我失去了继续求学的机会。十七岁那年我到大连当学徒，那时见人家画图，听人家讲螺丝钉还有几寸几分的区别，都感到无比新奇。我朦胧的感到技术这玩意不简单，是个铁饭碗，暗地下了学技术的决心。我买了本“钳工手册”，散工后到一位老师傅家里看。那些表格、公式，看来看去，老是弄不明白。问老师傅，他一字不识，回答不上。以后我就教他认字，他就给我讲说不出道理来的技术。我学技术的决心，在那样的时代不过是一个可怜的梦想。
    解放后，工人成了国家的主人，党不断教育我们爱护自己的工厂。那时我做检修工，机器坏了，要找原因；如何维护，要想办法；领导同志又常找我研究技术问题。文化程度太低，工作中遇到的困难是很多的。就拿看图纸来说吧，凭经验能看个大概，却弄不清物体的构造和原理，更难发现其中的问题。对于工作中遇到的理论性问题，更是知其然不知其所以然。种种事实使我懂得了要占领技术知识的阵地，必须首先攻克文化科学的堡垒。在这种思想的指导下，1949年起我就开始自修文化课程。1950年以后，党为我们创办了各种形式的业余学校，我一直是这些学校的学生。记得第一次跨进业余学校的大门时，真有千言万语在我心头翻腾。旧社会没给我求学的机会，党却为我创造了学习的条件。我深深感到提着书包进课堂不是一件平淡的事情，它体现着党的培养和期望。
    这时，党又提拔我做车间主任和厂长。一个在旧社会里毫无地位的工人，在新社会却成了国家企业的领导骨干，这真是一个天翻地复的变化。每当想到这一点，我总感到自己为党做的工作还太少，自己知道的东西距离工作的需要还太远。能够辜负党的信任么？不，绝不！工作责任愈重，我就越发感到学习的重要，越发顽强地坚持学习。我向苏联同志学习企业管理的经验，我向工人和技术人员学习生产技术知识，我在业余学校长年坚持系统的文化学习。学习使我增长了知识，技术人员再送来一张图纸时，我不再为那些线条所迷惑，能够进行审查和修改。平时我常同工人们一道研究生产技术，运用理论解决一些实际问题，学习推动了工作，反过来更坚定了我在学习上的信心和决心。我深深感到：学习——工作——学习，是一个互相促进、无限反复的过程。在这个过程中，党给了我热情的鼓励和巨大的支持。市里领导同志每次下厂都要问起我的学习情况，每逢有课的晚间，工厂党组织总是想方设法地帮助我从繁忙的工作中抽出身来，有工作别的同志就主动地帮我做了。没有党的关怀和支持，坚持几年学习简直是不可思议的事情。
    从1950年到现在的将近十年中我没有间断过学习。最初我在旅大函授学校学习初中物理，后来这个学校不再招收市内的学员，我就转入区办业余中学继续学习；不久这个学校停办，我又转入大连四中业余中学学习初中语文和数学。1955年，为了投考高中，我在本厂技术员帮助下突击学完了初中化学，同年考入大连工学院附设夜校的高中班，自1957年起升入本科学习大学课程。在学习过程中遇到过许多困难，这些困难在工厂组织和学校教师的帮助下，都被克服了。担负领导工作要经常出席市里召开的各种会议，为了不影响听课，我总是随身携带着当晚要用的课本和笔记，遇上有制图课时，书包装满了，还得挟一卷图纸，散会后就立即赶到学校听课，来不及吃饭，就在课间休息时啃几口预先准备的干粮。市里的会议有时要到七、八点钟才结束，散会后哪怕只剩下一节课我也要到学校去，能够听多少是多少，下课后，大伙回家了，我再留下请老师补课。十年来我从未因为散会较晚而缺席。学习中遇到的最大困难是经常出差，1959年上半年就曾出差四次，其中一次就长达两个星期。出差后我总是一面设法补课，一面坚持学习新课，第一次听课几乎完全不懂，但是不懂我也要听，我也要记。这样听课是很枯燥的，我总是强迫自己集中精力听到底。听过一遍总会有些印象，课后再看课本，点点滴滴，细嚼烂咽，印象就会清晰、深刻一些。实在无法解决的问题，我就记下来，第二次听课时再请教老师。这样，第二次课就可以听懂一半，第三次课就可以赶上队伍了。遇到这种情况，我觉得最重要的是不给自己开后门留退路，一定要刻苦努力，迎头赶上，否则愈拉愈远，最后就将不得不中断学习。刚升入大学，我对课程的复杂性估计不足，课外很少复习和做作业。第一次参加考试，结果只得了三分。后来经过老师的指点，加强了课外复习和作业。我所在的工厂只我一人学习大学课程，复习时没有同伴，为做一道题，总要反复思考，反复演算，有时花了三、四个小时还找不到一个正确的答案。眼看三、四个小时滑过去了，怎能不心痛呢？但我觉得寻求难题的解答要像勇士们攻占敌人的堡垒那样，沉着坚定，百折不回。而当经过一段紧张思索，终于解决了一道难题的时候，虽然我有了一把年纪的人，却也乐得直想蹦起来。由于加强了课外复习和作业，在高等数学的结业考试中，我取得了五分的成绩。参加业余学习，时间总是最难保证的。尤其担任领导工作，不仅上班时间抽不出空来，就连无课的晚间也被各种会议或活动挤满了，每天晌午休息时间和组织决定的其它政治理论学习时间，我又一向是用来读报和学习政治理论的。怎么办呢？只有合理安排个人生活这一条路了。每天早晨我都起得很早，吃罢早饭，离上班还有一个多小时，我就利用这段时间自修。每天下课后虽然已是深夜，我仍然要把当天所学的东西温习一下。然后再睡觉。星期日再把处理个人生活琐事的时间压缩一下，挤出一个上午来自修。我觉得参加业余学习最重要的在于长期坚持，养成习惯。每天早晨虽然只有一个多小时，如果长期坚持，一个学期就可以积累两三百个小时，相当于高等学校三个学期的全部教学时数。在学习过程中，我觉得还必须不断地跟自己思想上的消极因素作斗争。我的身体不好，常常不得不躺着看书。我也有过这样的想法：我的年纪大了，身体一天天地弱了，学习也有了一定的成绩，算了吧。但我又想：今天就想放弃学习，明天是否还想放弃工作呢？学习是为了工作，同样是党交给我的任务，我没有权利放弃它！
    十余年来，党不断地教育我，培养我，使我提高了觉悟，成了一个光荣的共产党员；使我从一个普通工人成长为国家企业的领导干部；使我得到了学习的机会，并且取得了一定的成绩。但是，我所做的一切，跟党的要求、跟突飞猛进的社会主义事业的需要比较起来，还只是迈开了第一步。作为一个共产党员，我决心在今后的工作和学习中，按照党的指示，鼓足干劲，向着红透专深的目标勤奋努力。我一定要把业余学习坚持到底，并且不断把学到的知识运用到生产工作中去，以更大更好的成绩，回答党对我的关怀和培养，回答大家对我的信任和期望。
