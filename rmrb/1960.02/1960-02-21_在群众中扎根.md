　　Rooted in the Masses
　　By our reporters Lü Suxuan and Zhao Yuxin

　　On the Shaanxi Plateau, famous for its old sheepskins, there is often a young man carrying a bedroll and a backpack. Regardless of the snow-covered winter, the scorching summer, or the continuous rain and muddy autumn, he tirelessly travels between the seven counties of Yan'an Prefecture, including Wuqi, Zhidan, and Huangling. He goes deep into the communes to purchase animal products such as hides, wool, and casings, and also brings daily necessities such as towels, socks, and soap to the farmers and herdsmen. This is Ma Yuanheng, the advanced procurement worker from the Tianjin Branch of the China Animal By-Products Import & Export Corporation, stationed in Shaanxi.

　　Ma Yuanheng, a member of the Communist Youth League, was an apprentice sorting hides in a fur processing factory three years ago. In 1957, the Animal By-Products Corporation, in order to strengthen the work of organizing sources of goods, established long-term procurement teams in key livestock-producing areas such as Shaanxi and Shanxi. Since then, he has been responsible for procurement in Yan'an Prefecture, Shaanxi. Leaving the factory to procure goods in an unfamiliar area thousands of miles away, it is easy to imagine the nervousness of Ma Yuanheng, who only had a junior primary school education and an apprentice background. After going to the countryside, unfamiliar roads and language barriers were the first difficulties he encountered in his work. He thought that to do a good job, he must be familiar with the geography, grasp the situation, and take root in the masses. Therefore, he always paid attention to memorizing local dialects, prepared a map of Yan'an Prefecture, and drew various symbols and traffic routes on the map wherever he went. He also learned about the basic data of each region, such as the number of goats, sheep, and pigs raised, the sales volume, and the characteristics of the products, and understood the key producing areas. He quickly found a set of procurement rules. For example, he found that the climate changes greatly in each season in the northern and southern counties of this prefecture. The southern counties start shearing wool and grabbing cashmere earlier in the spring, so when he purchased wool and cashmere, he went from south to north. In autumn, because the north gets cold earlier and sheep are slaughtered earlier, he purchased hides from north to south.

　　Before communization, Ma Yuanheng had done two outstanding pieces of work:

　　Wuqi County is a key county with a large number of sheep. In the past, local farmers did not shear second-cut wool, fearing that the sheep would freeze to death. After learning about this situation, Ma Yuanheng thought that Zhidan County is a neighboring county of Wuqi, and the climate of the two counties is similar. The farmers in Zhidan can shear second-cut wool, and Wuqi can also shear. He wanted to select key areas for publicity and experimentation to break this old routine. After he reported this idea to the county party committee and the Bureau of Commerce, he received enthusiastic support from the party committee. Ma Yuanheng rushed to the Qinchun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chengguan Town nearby and, together with the shepherds, chose a good day to do a shearing experiment. They sheared second-cut wool for all the sheep in the cooperative. After a few days, although there was a cold rain, each sheep was as strong as before. This experience was valued by the county party committee and was quickly popularized throughout the county, breaking the old routine that Wuqi County had never sheared second-cut wool.

　　Farmers in Luochuan County did not grab cashmere after shearing the wool, but sheared the cashmere and wool together. This situation attracted Ma Yuanheng's attention. One morning, just after dawn, Ma Yuanheng set off for the Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in Xi'angong Village, Luochuan County. He and the cadres of the cooperative jointly calculated a detailed account. If the cashmere and wool are sheared together, they can only be sold at the price of wool, which is six jiao per jin, while the price of one jin of cashmere is as high as three yuan. The director of the cooperative welcomed his approach very much, and the masses also wanted to learn the cashmere-grabbing technique, so he used five sheep to demonstrate on the spot. In less than an hour, he grabbed all the cashmere from the five sheep. Through the transfer of technology, more than 1,000 jin of cashmere and wool were purchased in this agricultural cooperative in one morning, which greatly increased the income of farmers. After the news spread, more than a dozen agricultural cooperatives came to invite him to teach the technique of bundling sheep and grabbing cashmere.

　　In this way, Ma Yuanheng quickly took root among the masses in northern Shaanxi, completed his tasks excellently every year, and was continuously selected as an advanced worker by the local and Tianjin Animal By-Products Corporation, and was recently rated as the company's "procurement pacesetter."

    在群众中扎根
    本报记者　吕素瑄　赵玉昕
    在盛产老羊皮的陕北高原上，经常有一个背着铺盖、挎着背包的青年人，不管是大雪纷飞的寒冬，烈日当头的炎夏，阴雨连绵、遍地泥泞的深秋，总是不辞辛苦地奔走在延安专区的吴旗、志丹、黄陵等七个县之间。他深入公社收购皮张、绒毛、肠衣等各种畜产品，还给农牧民送来了毛巾、袜子、肥皂等日用品。这就是中国畜产公司天津分公司的进货标兵——长驻陕西的采购员马元亨。
    共青团员马元亨，三年前还是皮毛加工厂分拣皮张的徒工。1957年畜产公司为了加强组织货源工作，在陕西、山西等畜产品重点产区建立了长驻采购小组。从此，他就担任了陕西延安专区的采购工作。一个人离开工厂，到几千里外的陌生地区去采购，这对于只具有初小文化、徒工出身的马元亨来说，紧张的心情是可以想见的。下乡后，道路不熟、语言不通是他在工作中首先碰到的困难。他想，要搞好工作必须熟悉地理、掌握情况，在群众中扎根。于是他随时注意牢记方言，自备了一份延安专区的地图，走过一处，就在地图上画上各种符号和交通路线。他还了解每个地区的山羊、绵羊、生猪的养殖头数、销售数量和产品的特点等基本资料，并了解了重点产区。他很快地找到了一套收购的规律。如他发现这个专区由于南北各县每个季节的气候变化很大，春天南部各县先开始剪毛，抓绒，所以他在收购羊毛、羊绒时，由南向北走。秋天，因为北部先冷，宰羊较早，他便由北向南收购皮张。
    在公社化以前，马元亨曾经做了两件出色的工作：
    吴旗县是一个饲养羊较多的重点县，以前当地农民都不会剪二茬羊毛，怕把羊冻死。马元亨了解到这个情况后，想到志丹县是吴旗的邻县，两县气候差不多，志丹的农民能剪二茬毛，吴旗也可以剪。他想选择重点，宣传试验，打破这个老常规。当他把这个想法向县委和商业局汇报后，得到党委的热情支持。马元亨赶到附近的城关镇秦春农业生产合作社和羊倌一起选择好天气，做剪毛的试验。他们给社里的羊都剪了二茬毛，过了几天，虽然下了一场冷雨，但是每只羊都健壮如前。这个经验受到县委的重视，很快在全县普遍推广了，打破了吴旗县历年不剪二茬羊毛的老常规。
    洛川县的农民不是在剪了毛以后再抓羊绒，而是羊绒和羊毛一齐剪掉。这个情况引起了马元亨的注意。一天早上，天刚亮，马元亨便动身到洛川县的西安宫村的东方红农业社去，他和这个社的干部共同算了一笔细账。绒毛若和羊毛一块剪下来，只能按羊毛的价格出售，每斤六角钱，而一斤绒毛的价格却高达三元。社长非常欢迎他的作法，群众也很想学会抓绒技术，于是他便用五只羊当场示范表演。不到一小时便把五只羊的羊绒全部抓完了。通过传授技术，一个上午就在这个农业社收购了羊绒、羊毛一千多斤，为农民增加了一笔很大的收入。消息传出后，十多个农业社来邀请他传授捆羊抓绒的技术。
    马元亨就是这样在陕北群众中很快生了根，每年都出色的完成了任务，连续被当地和天津畜产公司评选为先进工作者，最近又被评为公司的“进货标兵”。（附图片）
