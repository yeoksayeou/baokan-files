Factory Director Works Tirelessly at the Furnace

The workers of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation are working with soaring enthusiasm, ushering in a new upsurge in production and construction. Li Feng'en, the vice-director of the Iron Refining Plant, who was born a worker, fights day and night at the furnace front. This is him (right) and the furnace workers together studying how to improve the quality of the mud used to plug the tapping hole, creating conditions for the blast furnace to tap iron nine times a day.
