Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd, Washington Dispatch: On the eve of his visit to South America, U.S. President Eisenhower delivered a televised speech, vigorously touting military strength while earnestly expressing America's "friendship" and "cooperation" to Latin American countries.

The U.S. President, in a speech adorned with pleasing phrases such as "peace," "cooperation," "non-interference," "mutual respect," and the "Good Neighbor Policy," brazenly flaunted military power to Latin American countries, and clamored that the United States is determined to "maintain American security" according to the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance.

In his speech delivered on the evening of the 21st, Eisenhower went to great lengths to assert that the purpose of his visit to South America was to "cooperate closely" with these countries, "seek a fulfilling life," and establish "a just peace." However, he devoted half of his speech to promoting America's military strength policy. Eisenhower said that the United States "has established a vast and powerful arsenal of weapons to maintain peace" and "built up a tremendous deterrent force," thus gaining "respect" both at home and abroad. He boasted that "our hundreds of Air Force bombers deployed around the world – each capable of terrible destruction – constitute a force superior to any other in quantity, quality, and strategic deployment of bases. In addition, we have a powerful nuclear force... and advanced missiles constantly increasing the armaments of all ground forces and other military units."

This president, who proclaimed America's "peaceful" intentions, said, "The Mutual Security Program makes it possible to implement a forward defense strategy to enhance the security of all countries, including our southern neighbors."

Eisenhower said with a threatening tone, "I am confident that our Latin American neighbors understand the importance of all these facts as well as our people at home." He wanted Latin American countries to "believe in the strength of the United States as the anchor of security for the free world."

Eisenhower also announced that, as the "fundamental principles and attitudes" of the United States' relations in the Western Hemisphere, the U.S. "resolutely fulfills the guarantees made under the 1947 Rio Treaty to help maintain the security of the Americas," "We will do everything in our power to promote the victory of human freedom throughout the hemisphere," "We condemn all activities that undermine the democratic institutions of the Americas through coercion or subversion." Eisenhower's words nakedly exposed America's "Big Stick Policy," which aims to intimidate and suppress the struggle of Latin American countries, especially Cuba, to change the U.S. domination.

To whitewash America's colonial policy, Eisenhower spoke of the "Good Neighbor Policy" in his speech. He said that this "Good Neighbor Policy is a permanent guide, which includes non-interference, mutual respect, and the equality of all countries under the law." He vehemently denied that the United States maintains a colonial relationship with Latin America. He said shamelessly, "Throughout history, no country has had a more decent record in dealing with other countries than the United States."

Eisenhower also revealed in his speech that the United States intended to win over South American countries and further plunder these countries through economic aid. He said that the United States has "always been eager" to "cooperate" with Latin American countries to enable these countries to achieve "sound development" economically. Eisenhower said, "This will be a busy visit, because our neighbors have many problems, and they are troublesome: lack of development funds, highly volatile prices for export commodities, the need for regional common markets to improve efficiency and attract new loans, and the need to improve health, education, housing and transportation." He stated that these problems are the issues to be discussed in each country he will visit.

Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd, Washington Dispatch: U.S. President Eisenhower departed from Washington by plane today to visit four South American countries.

According to earlier announcements by U.S. officials, Eisenhower will visit Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay in succession. He will also stop in Puerto Rico on the way back and forth. The total duration of Eisenhower's overseas visit, including travel, is fourteen days.

Accompanying Eisenhower on his visit are Secretary of State Herter and officials from the U.S. National Advisory Council on Inter-American Affairs.

Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: U.S. authorities are vigorously strengthening "security" work during Eisenhower's visit to South America to prevent any possible anti-American demonstrations.

According to an Associated Press report from San Juan, Puerto Rico, on February 22nd, because Eisenhower is scheduled to land in San Juan at noon on the 22nd en route to his visit to South America, "Puerto Rican authorities on Monday increased the number of police and security officers at the palm-lined international airport on both sides of San Juan... Security authorities also issued special orders managing crowds at the airport." The news revealed that the heightened security was because people demanding Puerto Rican independence "will hold demonstrations as close to the airport as possible."

According to a report in the Swiss "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" on the 16th, security measures for Eisenhower's visit are also being vigorously carried out in Argentina. The newspaper said that "President Frondizi seems to be personally involved in the matter, and he has repeatedly consulted with military and police officials on this issue in recent days."

In Chile, Uruguay, and Brazil, which Eisenhower will also visit, U.S. authorities have also consulted with the governments of the aforementioned countries and taken equally strict precautions. According to reports, to ensure that Eisenhower's visit to Brazil is peaceful, Brazilian authorities have mobilized more than 6,000 military police.

### 对拉丁美洲人民欺骗和恫吓兼施  美国总统满脸杀气谈“友谊”  艾森豪威尔动身赴南美　大批军警为总统保镖

    对拉丁美洲人民欺骗和恫吓兼施
    美国总统满脸杀气谈“友谊”
    艾森豪威尔动身赴南美　大批军警为总统保镖
    新华社22日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔在访问南美前夕发表电视广播演说，大肆鼓吹军事实力，同时向拉丁美洲国家竭力表示美国的“友谊”和“合作”。
    美国总统在装饰着“和平”、“合作”、“不干涉”、“互相尊重”、“好伙伴政策”等动听的词句的演说中，向拉丁美洲国家肆无忌惮地摆弄军事威力，并叫嚷美国决心根据泛美军事公约“维持美洲安全”。
    艾森豪威尔在21日晚间发表的这篇演说中，竭力表明他访问南美的目的是同这些国家“密切合作”，“谋求美满的生活”和建立“正义的和平”。但是他用了演说的一半篇幅来宣传美国的军事实力政策。艾森豪威尔说，美国“建立了巨大的威力强大的武器的武器库来维持和平”，“建立了一支巨大的威慑力量”，因而受到国内外的“尊重”。他吹嘘“我们部署在全世界的数以百计的空军轰炸机——其中每一架都能够进行一次可怕的破坏——构成了一支在数量、质量上、以及基地的战略部署上比其他任何力量都优越得多的力量。此外，我们还有一支强大的核力量，……还有不断在增加一切地面部队和其他军事部队的军备的先进的导弹。”
    这位宣扬美国“和平”意图的总统说，“共同安全计划使得有可能实行前沿防御战略，来加强包括我们南方邻国在内的各国安全”。
    艾森豪威尔带着恫吓口吻说，“我确信我们的拉丁美洲邻国像我们国内的人一样懂得这一切事实的重要意义”。他要拉丁美洲国家“相信美国作为自由世界安全之锚的力量”。
    艾森豪威尔还宣布，作为美国在西半球的关系的“基本原则和态度”，美国“坚决履行根据1947年里约热内卢公约作出的帮助维持美洲安全的保证”，“我们将尽我们一切力量来促使人类自由在整个半球获得胜利”，“我们谴责一切通过逼迫或颠复来破坏美洲的民主制度的活动”。艾森豪威尔的这一番话更赤裸裸地暴露了美国的“大棒政策”，它的目的在恐吓并镇压拉丁美洲国家，首先是古巴，争取改变美国统治地位的斗争。
    为了给美国的殖民政策擦脂抹粉，艾森豪威尔在演说中谈到“好伙伴政策”。他说，这个“好伙伴政策是一个永久的指南，它包含不干涉、互相尊重、各国在法律上一律平等”。他竭力否认美国对拉丁美洲保持殖民主义的关系。他大言不惭地说，“在整个历史上，没有一个国家在同其他国家打交道方面有比美国体面的记录”。
    艾森豪威尔在演说中还明显地透露美国要通过经济援助来拉拢南美国家和进一步掠夺这些国家。他说，美国“始终热切地”希望同拉丁美洲国家“合作”，以使这些国家在经济上得到“健全的发展”。艾森豪威尔说，“这将是一次忙碌的访问，因为我们邻国的问题很多，很麻烦：缺少开发资金、出口商品的价格波动很大、需要区域性共同市场来提高效率和吸引新的贷款、需要改进卫生、教育、房屋和运输事业。”他表示，在他要访问的每个国家中，这些问题是要讨论的问题。
    新华社22日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔今天由华盛顿乘飞机动身到南美四个国家去访问。
    按照美国官方早先宣布，艾森豪威尔这次将要先后访问巴西、阿根廷、智利和乌拉圭四个国家。来回途中还将在波多黎各停留。艾森豪威尔这次出国访问的时间包括旅途在内总共十四天。
    随艾森豪威尔前去访问的有国务卿赫脱和美国泛美事务全国顾问委员会的官员。
    新华社22日讯　美国当局正在大力加强艾森豪威尔访问南美期间的“保安”工作，预防可能爆发的任何反美示威。
    据美联社22日从波多黎各的圣胡安报道，由于艾森豪威尔预定于22日中午在飞往南美访问的途中在圣胡安着陆，“波多黎各当局星期一向圣胡安的两边种植着棕榈树的国际机场增派了警察和保安军官……保安当局还发布了管理机场人群的特别命令”。消息透露，这次戒备如此森严，是因为要求波多黎各独立的人“将在尽可能到达的靠近机场的地方举行示威”。
    据瑞士“新苏黎世报”16日报道，在阿根廷，为艾森豪威尔所安排的保安措施也在大力进行。这家报纸说，“弗朗迪西总统似乎亲自过问这件事，他在最近几天曾一再同军警负责人就这个问题进行商议”。
    在艾森豪威尔将要访问的智利、乌拉圭和巴西，美国当局也已经和上述国家的政府商量，采取了同样严密的戒备措施。据报道，为了确保艾森豪威尔在巴西的访问太平无事，巴西当局所动员的军警在六千人以上。
