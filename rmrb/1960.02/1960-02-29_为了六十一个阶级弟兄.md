Editor's Note: After the food poisoning incident involving the Pínglù laborers, the local Party committee, the People's Government, and the soldiers and civilians of the capital fully demonstrated the spirit of class friendship and organized an emergency rescue operation. All the poisoned laborers have been rescued from danger. The noble communist style demonstrated by the soldiers and civilians of the capital and the local cadres and masses in this rescue operation is worthy of great promotion. The incident was reported in the "Urgent Rescue Over a Thousand Miles" communication on February 7, the "Piercing Through Clouds and Fog to Rescue Relatives" communication on February 21, the "Ministry of Health Writes Letter Thanking Officers and Soldiers of a Certain Air Force Unit" news on February 22, and the "All Poisoned Laborers in Pínglù Out of Danger" news on February 23. The China Youth Daily published a communication and editorial on February 28, vividly reporting and commenting on the moving deeds of this rescue operation. It is now reprinted for our readers.

	February 3, 1960, the seventh day of the first lunar month
		It is now exactly 4:00 PM
	Wángfǔjǐng Street in the capital is bustling with activity. The stores are adorned with festive decorations, and people are walking back and forth with smiling faces. At the very small state-owned special drug store located on the east side of Bāmiancáo, north of Wángfǔjǐng, the salespersons are smiling and answering customers, and the abacus beads are clattering non-stop in the office as they rush to close accounts before getting off work. Suddenly, someone excitedly brings a large handful of red and green tickets:
		"Comrades, there's a wonderful evening party at the CPPCC Auditorium tonight, a Spring Festival grand gathering for commercial workers in the capital!"
		"Great!" Everyone is overjoyed.
	It turns out that during the Spring Festival holiday, when we all rest, commercial workers are still busy behind the counters, working tirelessly so that we can buy what we want during the holidays. Therefore, this grand gathering, featuring performances by famous artists from the capital, with a very exciting program, had to be postponed until the seventh day of the first lunar month. Everyone received their tickets and was even happier to work hard, just waiting to bring their families to enjoy the first Spring Festival of the 1960s...
	Suddenly, the phone on the desk rings urgently. Lǎo Hú, the clerk who wears glasses, grabs the receiver:
		"Hello, who is this?"
		"Long distance! This is the Pínglù County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi. Sixty-one of our laborers have food poisoning and urgently need one thousand ampoules of 'Dimercaprol'. The sooner the better, the sooner the better!" The voice on the receiver is very loud and anxious.
		"We'll prepare the medicine immediately!" Fearing that the other party couldn't hear clearly, Lǎo Hú almost shouted, "We'll try to get the medicine to Tàiyuán right away!"
		"No! Tàiyuán is more than a thousand miles from Pínglù, and you have to cross mountains and valleys, and the transportation is extremely inconvenient. Please try to airlift it... airlift it!!"
	The lives of sixty-one comrades are at stake! One thousand injections, must be airlifted! ... Every word is like a nail, hammered into people's hearts! While Lǎo Hú is scratching his head and talking to the other party, everyone has already gathered around. The store is in a state of tension, and the "exciting evening party" has long been forgotten. The Party branch immediately convened an emergency meeting to study the situation and decided to do everything possible to handle this matter well, mobilizing everyone to come up with solutions and immediately asking for instructions from their superiors. Thus, everyone in the store twisted their hearts into one rope and concentrated all their energy on this series of suspense and a series of difficulties....
	In our socialist family, hundreds of millions of working people are a closely knit whole. A red thread runs through, connecting every red heart. Everyone shares the same breath, shares weal and woe... The matter happened like this:
		February 2, in Pínglù County, Shanxi Province
	In a newly built red building, the lights are shining brightly. The enlarged meeting of the Pínglù County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is proceeding as usual. The participants are in high spirits, discussing the 1960 Great Leap Forward plan.
	At seven o'clock, Director Yàn of the County People's Committee hurried into the meeting room and found Director Wáng of the County People's Hospital, saying:
		"An hour ago, sixty-one laborers on the Zhānggōu section of the Fēngnán Highway had food poisoning. Please organize medical personnel for rescue immediately! ..."
	Before they could finish speaking, Comrade Hǎo Shìshān, the First Secretary of the Pínglù County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, sitting in the chairman's position, already knew about this emergency. This old secretary, in his fifties, immediately stood up, his eyes gleaming as he scanned the venue, and then resolutely said:
		"Comrades, we must now deal with an urgent matter with all our strength. The meeting is suspended!"
	After speaking, Secretary Hǎo flung his old cotton coat over his shoulders and immediately convened a meeting of the County Standing Committee to study the situation and decisively ordered a full-scale rescue. In a moment, large trucks carrying responsible comrades and all the best doctors from the county hospital were speeding through the vast darkness, crossing mountains and valleys, towards our sixty-one class brothers!
	Pínglù County is separated from Sānménxiá City in Henan Province only by the Yellow River. The Zhāngcūn area, fifty miles north of the county, is building a provincial highway from Ruìchéng Fēnglíngdù to Pínglù Nángōu. This highway is the transportation lifeline for the entire province of Shanxi to support the great construction project of the Yellow River Sānménxiá. The road-building laborers are all members of the People's Commune, and they work with great enthusiasm. Hóu Yǒngshèng, for example, carried hundreds of loads of earth in one day. They launched a competition against each other, reformed a series of tools, and the efficiency was improved step by step. Even during the Spring Festival, they voluntarily reduced their rest and achieved a great victory in the opening days. Who would have thought that this accidental misfortune would happen! These are sixty-one excellent activists in building socialism. Their lives are in danger. How can we not feel sorry for them?
	Before the county's cars arrived at the Zhānggōu construction site, Xūe Zhōnglìng, the First Secretary of the Zhāngcūn Commune Party Committee, had already arrived with more than twenty medical personnel from the commune hospital. They were busy washing the patients' bodies, washing their feet, and disinfecting them. The county doctors jumped out of the cars and immediately began to diagnose and treat them!
	They used various methods:
	They gave the patients mung bean and licorice water to detoxify, but it was ineffective!
	They also injected morphine into the patients, but it was still ineffective!
	... Ineffective! Ineffective!
	Tension, extreme tension! The air is suffocating, and the doctors and nurses are sweating profusely. After a tense and detailed consultation, Comrade Jiě Kèqín and other responsible doctors from the County People's Hospital determined:
		"The specific drug 'Dimercaprol' must be used! This drug must be injected into the patients before dawn on the 4th, otherwise it will be ineffective! Quickly send someone to find it!"
			At the same time
	In the county committee, a restless night.
	Our Secretary Hǎo is smoking non-stop, guarding the telephone. The wrinkles on the corners of his mouth are even deeper. Having participated in the revolution for more than twenty years, he has developed such a habit: when he is sick himself (he still suffers from arthritis), it seems like nothing to him, but when the villagers have a headache or fever, he remembers it and can't let it go, and he doesn't feel comfortable until he finds a way to help you cure it. What's more, now that these sixty-one comrades are in mortal danger! Secretary Hǎo is even more restless. ... At this time, they received a phone call from the patients urgently needing "Dimercaprol" and immediately sent someone to find it. Wáng Wénmíng and Zhāng Yínhǔ, the two young men responsible for dispensing medicine at the County People's Hospital, didn't even bother to put on thick clothes. They took two steps as one, leaping over deep ditches and dangerous ravines, to find medicine in Sānménxiá City. Look, this is what is called a real "pharmaceutical officer". If the pharmacy doesn't have it, he is willing to go through all kinds of hardships, running all over the world, to find it for you!
	They arrived at the Yellow River Máojīndù ferry. Under the faint starlight, they saw the Yellow River churning with huge waves and heard the river water lapping against the shore, each sound shaking people's hearts. These two young people clearly knew that crossing the Yellow River at night was prone to capsizing and falling into the water, which was extremely dangerous. However, in order to save the lives of sixty-one builders of the motherland, at this important moment, even if the danger was great, they were willing to take the risk! They didn't hesitate to knock on the boatman's door. The boatman woke up from his snoring:
		"What are you knocking on the door for?"
		"Please ferry us across the river!"
		"The Yellow River ferry, since ancient times, does not operate at night. Wait until dawn!"
		"We can't wait! We must cross the river tonight to save people!"
	When the boatmen heard that it was to save sixty-one builders of the motherland, the old boatman Wáng Xījiān, despite suffering from asthma tonight, suddenly jumped up from his warm bed, put on his repair clothes, and shouted, "Guys, let's go!" Wáng Yúntáng and several other people followed closely behind. Arriving at the shore, without saying a word, they started the boat and headed straight for the center of the river. Relying on decades of experience fighting the Yellow River's huge waves and relying on their sincere hearts, they finally broke the old tradition of the Yellow River not being crossed at night and safely delivered the medicine seekers to the other side.
	However, Sānménxiá City did not have this specific drug!
	This was already noon on February 3rd. Time, please stop for a moment! Why do you always rush past people, and you can't stop you even if you want to...
	Secretary Hǎo instructed urgently and firmly: "We should still solve the problem locally. Go to Yùncéng County to find it! Go to Línfén County to find it! Go to nearby places to find it!"
	Just then, the Zhāngcūn Commune Hospital called again: "If we don't get 'Dimercaprol' before tomorrow morning, fourteen critically ill patients will die!"
	The phone calls looking for medicine kept coming back:
		Yùncéng County doesn't have this medicine!
		Línfén County doesn't have this medicine!
		Nearby places don't have this medicine!
	Secretary Hǎo said decisively: "For the lives of sixty-one comrades, we have no choice but to trouble the Central Government and ask for assistance from the capital. Make an urgent call to the Central Ministry of Health! Make an urgent call to the special drug store!"
	Thus, this tense rescue battle began in the capital, two thousand miles away, and continued...
	People's hearts are toward Beijing, and Beijing's heart immediately beats with Pínglù's heart...
	February 3, after 4:00 PM, in the Ministry of Health
	In a courtyard of the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China, many comrades from the Pharmaceutical Administration Bureau stopped their other work and busied themselves with this urgent matter. After receiving the call from the Pínglù County Committee, Comrade Jiāng Bīng of the Pharmaceutical Equipment Department told people to notify the Bāmiancáo Special Drug Store to prepare the medicine as quickly as possible, while running to ask the Director and several ministers who were attending the Party Group meeting for instructions. Vice Minister Xú Yùnběi instructed: Be sure to handle this matter responsibly, and immediately find the Civil Aviation Administration or ask the Air Force to support the medicine delivery!
	Now, Comrade Lǎo Wú, a plump man in the department, is sweating profusely, anxiously urging the special drug store to provide the medicine. Communist Youth League member Jì Zhōngchāng is contacting the Civil Aviation Administration; the phone is transmitting uneven breathing. Obviously, the other party is also anxious:
		"The earliest flight to Tàiyuán is tomorrow morning, that's too late, too late!... Right, request Air Force support!"
	It's really urgent, the phone lines are constantly busy. When Little Jì connected the phone to the Air Force leadership, the Air Force already knew about this matter. It turned out that the Civil Aviation Administration had called earlier to this effect. At this time, the duty director further understood the Ministry of Health's requirements from Little Jì and immediately ran to ask the leaders for instructions. The leaders instructed: Provide full support, and do it quickly and well! Thus, as if a battle had begun, the personnel concerned took their positions, studied the flight route, studied the airdrop, and issued orders to the troops... All this was done very quickly, all this was imbued with the glorious tradition of the People's Army, and all this was imbued with extremely deep love for the people!
	Class friendship is as deep as the sea. Among us, when one person has difficulties, hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of strangers will eagerly extend their hands to you and spare no effort to help you...
		Now, it's already after 5:00 PM
	On the long road from outside Guǎng'ānmén in the capital to Bāmiancáo, through the bustling crowds, through the endless stream of vehicles, walking through the streets and alleys, a worker in his thirties is desperately pedaling a cargo bicycle in the cold wind of the depths of winter.
		"Comrades, make way, make way!"
	He keeps shouting to pedestrians. The cargo on the bicycle is "Dimercaprol". The cyclist is called Wáng Yīngpǔ, an advanced worker. Look, he is pedaling the wheels so fast that they are spinning, and he covered the thirty-mile distance in just over an hour. Why did he have to transport the medicine from thirty miles away? There's a little story in here:
	This "Dimercaprol" was originally imported from abroad and was considered a rare drug. However, during the Great Leap Forward last year, the workers of our state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Pharmaceutical Factory creatively uncovered its secret and are now able to produce and supply it in large quantities. It is no longer a rare thing, and its value has been downgraded from a special drug to an ordinary drug, so the special drug store has just sent it to the warehouse, preparing to send it to ordinary pharmaceutical companies for distribution. Who knew that it would suddenly be needed again now, so they pulled it back.
	Let's say that Wáng Yīngpǔ is now panting as he moves the medicine into the house, and everyone suddenly surrounds him:
		"Lǎo Wáng, you really have immortal legs!"
			At the same time
	In our special drug store, the Party Branch Secretary Tián Chén and Communist Party member Hé Sīlǔ are holding flashlights, leaning over the map, shining and searching. What are they doing? The room is clearly lit with sunlight lamps. Usually, even a needle dropped on the ground can be found, but today it's not bright enough. Oh, they're looking for it: Where is Pínglù? They're thinking: How exactly should it be transported? These are still outstanding questions!
	Just at this critical moment, the Ministry of Health called again:
		"The Air Force has enthusiastically provided support, guaranteeing to airdrop the medicine to Pínglù County tonight! Please quickly pack the one thousand ampoules of medicine into wooden boxes, and attach light-emitting devices to the outside of the boxes..."
	There's an airplane! In people's hearts, it's like a long-awaited rain after a long drought, and they're so excited that they jump up! But then comes another difficulty: How can we solve the problem of these light-emitting devices?
			At the same time
	Time, a second, a minute, ... flashes by. Now there are only a few hours left before dawn on the 4th.
	In the Zhāngcūn Commune Hospital, the atmosphere is still extraordinarily tense! The members of the Zhāngcūn Commune have sent a large amount of tofu, vermicelli, vegetables, sugar, and fine grains to their brothers... These things are piled there, but who can eat them? Our brothers are still in danger! The Shanxi Provincial People's Hospital and the Línfén People's Hospital also quickly sent doctors after hearing this emergency news. Now, more than forty medical personnel, with beads of sweat on their foreheads, have not closed their eyes for more than twenty hours. In order to continue these sixty-one lives, all kinds of methods, both indigenous and foreign, have been exhausted, but the patients still show no signs of improvement!!
	Suddenly someone reported: "Comrades, the County Committee called and said that the Central Government has decided to send an airplane to deliver medicine tonight!"
	Is this true? It's true! The patients' desperate eyes suddenly lit up, and everyone's eyes were filled with tears of infinite gratitude...
			Now, the time is almost 7:00 PM
	In the special drug store, the medicine boxes are almost packed, but there's still no solution to the problem of the light-emitting devices. At this time, a girl wearing glasses suddenly tossed her braid and said:
		"I'll go to the Five Continents Electrical Material Store!" This person is called Lǐ Yùqiáo.
	She flew to the dazzling Five Continents Electrical Material Store. Wow, it was really crowded with customers. Communist Youth League member Hè Yí'ān was busy getting this and that for the customers. Lǐ Yùqiáo briefly explained the situation to Little Hè and asked him:
		"Can you get it done in thirty minutes?"
		"Don't worry, Sister Lǐ, I'll guarantee it!"
	Lǐ Yùqiáo helped him with sales, and Little Hè raised his legs and went to find someone. He happened to meet Wáng Míngdé on the road. Little Wáng is an advanced producer in Beijing and an enthusiastic young man. The two were quick-witted and studied as they ran. It was really a stumble and a wisdom. They wanted to weld four batteries together and connect a light bulb, but it would only last for half an hour; they also figured out how to use sixteen batteries and four light bulbs to install lights on all four sides of the medicine box, so that if one side went out when the airdrop landed, the other sides would still be lit. As they talked, they started to work. At this time, Director Lǎo Yáng of the sales department came back from a meeting outside and helped them when he heard that it was an emergency. After a while, Lǐ Yùqiáo came to urge again:
		"Time is running out, it can't exceed three minutes!"
		"We guarantee to have it done in two and a half minutes!"
	Sure enough, Lǐ Yùqiáo had just returned to the store when Little Wáng came rushing in with the welded light-emitting devices. It was really two and a half minutes!
			Now, it's after 7:30 PM
	A Victory-brand sedan sped out of the gate of the Ministry of Health and headed for the special drug store.
	The car arrived. At this time, as Lǎo Hé later described: I don't know how that box of medicine was taken out. Everyone rushed up, fearing to miss a minute or a second, fearing that someone would drop it on the ground. Many hands were holding these one thousand ampoules of "Dimercaprol", squeezing out of the store's small door, and gently placing it in the best seat of the Victory-brand sedan!
	The Victory-brand sedan, carrying one thousand ampoules of "Dimercaprol", was speeding through the brightly lit streets and the quiet tree-lined avenues of the suburbs of Beijing, honking its horn, speeding like an arrow to the airport.
			At the same time
	The telephone in the Pínglù County Post Office rang sharply. Since 3:00 PM, the Pínglù-Beijing long-distance telephone had become an extremely agile dedicated line. This call was from the Air Force leadership. Comrade Dǒng Hóngliàng, the Director of the Post Office, who was personally guarding the telephone, quickly connected the phone to the County Committee. Secretary Hǎo answered the phone and heard:
		"Please quickly find a flat area, keep it away from the river, and prepare four piles of firewood. As soon as the plane arrives, light the fire immediately as an air target marker!"
		"Okay! Prepare immediately!"
	Thus, the Secretary and the County Magistrate personally directed, and the wired broadcasting station broadcast in the loudest voice to the agencies, schools, and People's Communes near the county seat, to thousands and tens of thousands of people, the most urgent call from the County Committee and the County People's Committee. Wherever the sound reached, the cadres who were studying the pinyin writing put down their books and ran out, the students poured out of the classrooms where they were studying, the old people walked out with their canes, the newlyweds walked out of their warm new houses, the workers of the Construction Bureau dragged waste wood and broken firewood and ran to the open space outside the city; on the hillside of Shèngrénjiàn, there was another large group of male and female members of the Red Flag Commune, carrying large bundles of cotton firewood and reeds, running to this flat terrain...
	In the blink of an eye, four large piles of firewood, pointed at the top, had been prepared!
	Thousands of people stood in this open space called Shèngrénjiàn. People looked towards the vast night sky, towards the northeast direction, no, towards our great capital, filled with impatient excitement; people's hearts had already passed through the clouds! Comrade Sūn Zhìqín, who had worked in communications in the army, stood on the high hill, relying on his experience and his ears that could hear things ten miles away, listening to the movement of the plane...
	This is a victorious battle in which the communist style is greatly promoted. Long live the spirit of selflessness, friendship and mutual assistance!
			Now, it's 9:03 PM
	Beijing, stars all over the sky. A military transport plane, full of the deep affection of the people of the capital, soared into the silvery night sky, speeding like lightning in the southwest direction. Comrade Chén Yínqīng of the Ministry of Health went along with the plane.
	This was a very difficult flight. Night airdrop, without ground command and air-to-ground liaison at the Pínglù airdrop site, plus the complex terrain and heavy mountains, and the airdrop was of liquid medicine, and it had to be guaranteed to be foolproof... The leaders of the troops attached great importance to this airdrop mission, and the political commissar, the captain, and the chief of staff personally studied it. They specially selected the most experienced captain, navigator, communicator, and mechanic, and one plane was sent with two crews at the same time. Just before takeoff, they also selected the best parachute and added weight to the medicine box, and everything was planned with the most confidence. Everyone was full of confidence.
	A pilot excitedly asked the captain: "In order to ensure that the medicine box is delivered in time, I request permission to go down with the medicine box!"
	The captain said: "The leader has instructed that no one should go down. We must ensure that the medicine is accurately dropped!"
	Now, our eagle is flying at high speed. Below is the vast land, and the motherland is full of cities that never sleep. The stars and the lights of thousands of homes are shining together. At this time, how many people are still working hard for the motherland!
		Now, it's 11:23 PM
	"Please Pínglù prepare! Prepare! The plane will be in your county in seven minutes, light the fire immediately!"
	Director Dǒng immediately conveyed this phone notification from the Air Force leadership to the crowd waiting for the plane. Someone, I don't know who, poured some kerosene on each pile of firewood, and the flames soared into the sky, and the fire illuminated the sky and the earth red!
	At this time, the plane had crossed the Yellow River and arrived over Pínglù. Now the altitude of the plane is 2,700 meters. In order to ensure the accuracy of the airdrop, it must be lowered, the lower the more accurate! Captain Zhōu Liánshān pressed the control stick, and the plane quickly descended, 2,000, 1,500, 1,000... 500 meters, and the majestic shadows of the mountains swept past the fuselage. How dangerous! This is a fight of courage plus technology!
	All the personnel on the plane had their eyes wide open, and their hearts were extremely uneasy! The captain suddenly excitedly ordered:
		"Prepare for airdrop!"
	The parachute packer, the mechanic, and Little Chén had already turned on the lights on the medicine box. As soon as the electric bell rang, they accurately pushed the medicine box out of the cabin with a swoosh. One thousand ampoules of "Dimercaprol", with a parachute, fell down to the predetermined airdrop site, fell down! ... From the County Committee calling Beijing for help to the miracle medicine falling from the sky, how many units were involved, how many people were involved, but this entire complex and tortuous process only took more than eight hours. This is such an amazing speed!
	Don't we often say, "A feather sent from a thousand miles away, the gift is light but the sentiment is heavy"? This box of miracle medicine that fell from the sky is full of the most beautiful feelings of countless people in the capital, and it is heavier than Mount Tài!
			At the same time
	In Shèngrénjiàn outside the Pínglù County seat, the four piles of fire burned brighter and brighter. The flow of people was like a spring tide, and countless flashlight lights dotted the night sky, like the searchlights on Tiananmen Square in the capital on National Day night. Secretary Hǎo, County Magistrate Guō, and other leaders had all come to the scene in person.
	"Look, there's a light coming down from the sky!" Someone suddenly called out.
	"That's a parachute, that's the miracle medicine!"
	Thousands of hands were raised high, and everyone wanted to hold this box of medicine! People cheered for the plane and the parachute, one after another!
	The parachute, with its flashing lights, drifted down! The crowd chased the parachute, running! Running! County Magistrate Guō Fénghé ran towards the parachute and met Yáng Guǒwa, a Puju opera actress. She was a sixteen-year-old girl who played the role of a young woman. Her face was still covered with red powder, and she hadn't taken off her stage costume. She was dressed up just like she was on stage!
		"Guǒwa! Why did you run here too!" County Magistrate Guō asked her.
		"Everyone who watched the play came here, how could I not come, to receive the miracle medicine sent by Chairman Mao!" As she spoke, she hurriedly ran towards the parachute again.
	The parachute landed safely with the medicine box, and the lights on the four corners of the medicine box were shining brightly. The members of the Zàitóu Management Area were the first to grab the medicine box! Thousands of people crowded around this box of medicine. You just carried it two steps, and he grabbed it and carried it on his shoulder again...
	The best car and the best driver, Shěn Kuānliàng, sent by the Transportation Bureau, had already been waiting at the gate of the County Committee. The medicine box was placed on the car, and the car opened the throttle and sped to the Zhāngcūn Hospital, fifty miles away. As the saying goes: Pínglù is not flat, with three thousand ditches. The mountain roads here are narrow and rugged, extremely difficult to travel, and the car could break down and stall at any time. Shěn Kuānliàng had already done the best repairs to the car, but he was still thinking:
		"If something goes wrong, I'll carry it there!"
			February 3, late at night
	Waiting! Waiting! - At the gate of the Zhāngcūn Commune Hospital, the members of the commune and the medical personnel were anxiously waiting...
	The car is here! - Good!
	Immediately take down the medicine box,
	Inject immediately.
	The injection was very effective, immediately stopping the pain and restoring the patients' consciousness. The doctors originally stipulated that the medicine could not be found later than dawn on the 4th, but the medicine was delivered before dawn. Our sixty-one class brothers were rescued from danger. Their new and stronger lives were given by the Party and were saved by the class friendship of the comrades. Wild joy burst forth from the depths of people's hearts...
	It's not just these sixty-one people who were resurrected, no, everyone of us has two lives. The Party uses the sunshine of its ideology to help us eliminate the ideological germs left over from the old society and nurture us to become completely new people.
				February 5
	The red sun shines brightly, and the spring is bright.
	Guō Fénghé, the Secretary of the County Party Committee Secretariat and County Magistrate, and other leaders of the county, on behalf of the County Committee and the people of the entire county, led the County Cultural Troupe, carrying慰问品[wèiwèn pǐn - gifts or goods for showing care and concern], came to the Zhāngcūn Commune Hospital. They personally comforted the patients at their bedside. County Magistrate Guō was very happy from the bottom of his heart when he saw that the patients had recovered their health. The laborers tightly grasped County Magistrate Guō's hand, not knowing what to say.
	The laborer Zhōu Mǎnlù, with hot tears in his eyes, said:
		"The evil Japanese devils blinded one of my eyes, and no one cared; the Kuomintang Yán Xīshān killed so many of us, and we swallowed the bitterness into our stomachs! Today, when us ordinary laborers get a little sick, the Central Government sends airplanes to save us. The Party and Chairman Mao are really the people who care about us!"
	Wú Jìnxǐ, an old man from the Zhāngdiàn Commune, rushed from eighty miles away to see his son Wú Guǎngxīn. At this time, he was so excited that his whole body was shaking, and he pulled his son:
		"Boy, in our remote mountain ditch, I thought you were hopeless! Who would have thought that Chairman Mao in Beijing would care about my son even more than your old man! Boy, Chairman Mao is really your parents!"
	On the spot, everyone couldn't lie down anymore and got up one after another, asking County Magistrate Guō:
		"To thank the Party and Chairman Mao, and to thank the support of the people of the capital, we will go to work tomorrow!"
	County Magistrate Guō comforted them and said: "You must listen to the Party's words and rest well for a few days!"
	The company commander of the First Company couldn't suppress the surge in his heart, and clenched his two big fists, representing the laborers of the entire company, to County Magistrate Guō:
		"Our entire First Company guarantees to the Party and Chairman Mao: We will muster the greatest enthusiasm and take over all the work of the Third Company!"
	Following closely, everyone posted hundreds of big-character posters expressing their determination inside and outside the commune hospital and at the construction site; letters written to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao flew in like snowflakes...
	The laborers really did what they said. Once they went to work, they increased from digging fifteen cubic meters of earth per day in the past to digging thirty cubic meters, and the efficiency doubled. Some people even did three days' worth of work in one day! Everyone is determined to complete the highway supporting the great construction project of Sānménxiá three months ahead of schedule, and countless miracles are being created! ...
	It's not just our road-building laborers, no, the 120,000 people of Pínglù, no, the 650 million Chinese people, everyone has a raging fire burning in their hearts, and this fire is burning brighter and brighter: The deep love for the Party and Chairman Mao has turned into endless power, and people are using it to accelerate the construction of our great socialist motherland! Let's build her with great enthusiasm and at high speed. This is our backing, and this is our guarantee of eternal happiness! (Attached pictures)
	The doctors determined: "The specific drug 'Dimercaprol' must be used! ..."

    编者按　平陆民工食物中毒事件发生后，当地党委、人民政府和首都军民充分发挥了阶级友爱的精神，组织了紧急的抢救，中毒民工已经全部脱险。首都军民和当地干部群众在这次抢救行动中，充分表现出他们的共产主义的崇高风格是值得大大提倡的。关于这件事，本报已先后于2月7日的“千里急救”通讯、2月21日的“穿云破雾救亲人”通讯、“卫生部写信感谢空军某部官兵”新闻和2月23日的“平陆中毒民工全部脱险”新闻中，作了报道。中国青年报2月28日发表了一篇通讯和社论，生动地报道了和评论了这次抢救行动的感人事迹。现特转载，以飨读者。
        1960年2月3日，农历正月初七
          现在，整整是下午四点钟
    在首都王府井大街，车水马龙，热闹繁忙，商店穿戴着节日的盛装，人们满面春风地东来西往。就在这王府井北口八面槽的路东，有一家门市很小的国营特种药品商店。这时候，营业员们在笑盈盈地答对顾客，办公室里，算珠响个不停，快下班了，正忙着结账。忽然，有人兴致勃勃地拿来一大把红红绿绿的票子：
      “同志们，今晚政协礼堂有精采晚会，首都商业职工春节大联欢！”
      “好哇！”大伙乐得嘴都合不上了。
    原来，在春节放假的日子里，我们大家都休息，可商业职工却还忙在柜台上，为了让我们在假日里买到称心的东西，可真是忙得脚不沾地。所以，这个有首都著名艺术家表演、内容十分精采的大联欢，只好推到正月初七才举行。大家分到了票子，更是欢喜地忙工作，只等下班以后，带上全家老少，去尽兴欢度六十年代的第一个春节……
    陡然，办公桌上的电话，响起了十分急促的铃声，戴近视眼镜的业务员老胡，一把抓起听筒：
    “喂，哪里？”
    “长途！我是中共山西平陆县委，我们这里有六十一名民工发生食物中毒，急需一千支‘二巯基丙醇’，越快越好，越快越好！”听筒里的声音十分响亮而焦灼。
    “我们立刻准备药品！”很怕对方听不清楚，老胡几乎喊起来了：“我们马上设法把药发到太原！”
    “不行！太原距平陆尚有一千余里，而且要翻山越岭，交通极为不便，请设法空运……空运！！”
    六十一个同志的生命，危在旦夕！一千支注射剂，非得空运！……每一个字，都好似一颗钉，颗颗钉在人们的心上！就在老胡抓耳搔腮地和对方通话时，大家已经都围上来了。商店里好一阵紧张，人们的心里，早已把“精采晚会”丢得无影无踪。党支部立即召集紧急会议研究，决定全力以赴办好这件事。发动大家想办法，立刻请示领导。于是，全商店的人，把心拧成一股绳，把精力全都集中在这一连串的悬念，一连串的困难上了……。
    在我们的社会主义大家庭里，亿万劳动人民是一个亲密无间的整体。一根红线贯穿，颗颗红心相连，大家同呼吸，共甘苦……事情原来是这样发生的：
        2月2日，在山西省平陆县
    一座新落成的红色大楼里，灯火辉煌。中共平陆县委扩大会议，照常进行着。与会者心神振奋，讨论的是1960年跃进规划。
    七点钟时，县人民委员会燕局长匆匆奔进会议室，找到县人民医院王院长说：
    “一小时前，风南公路张沟段有六十一名民工，发生食物中毒，请立刻组织医务人员抢救！……”
    他们的话还没说完，坐在主席位置上的中共平陆县委第一书记郝世山同志，也已晓得了这紧急情况。这位五十来岁的老书记，立刻站了起来，目光炯炯地把会场扫视了一遍，然后，果决地说：
    “同志们，现在要全力处理一件急事，会议暂停！”
    说完，郝书记一甩手，披起那件旧棉大衣，立即召集县委常委会议研究，当机立断，全力抢救。片刻，大卡车就载着负责同志，载着县医院全部最好的医生，在茫茫的黑夜里，翻山越岭，向我们的六十一个阶级弟兄身边奔去！
    这平陆县与河南省的三门峡市，只隔一条黄河。县北五十里外张村一带，正在修建一条从芮城风陵渡到平陆南沟的省级公路，这条公路是山西全省支援黄河三门峡伟大建设工程的交通命脉。筑路民工都是人民公社社员，干起活来，真叫干劲冲天，有个叫侯永胜的，一个人一天就挑了几百担土。他们展开了对手赛，改革了一系列工具，工效步步提高。甚至春节期间，自愿少休息，打了个开门红的大胜仗。谁想竟发生了这偶然的不幸！这是六十一个多么好的建设社会主义的积极分子，他们的生命有危险，我们能不心疼吗？
    县里的汽车来到张沟工地以前，张村公社党委第一书记薛忠令，亲率公社医院二十多名医护人员，早已来到。他们正在忙着给病人洗身、洗脚、消毒。县里的医生跳下汽车，立即插手诊断，立即治疗！
    他们使用了各种办法：
    给患者喝下了绿豆甘草水解毒，无效！
    给患者又注射了吗啡，仍然无效！
    ……无效！无效！
    紧张，无比的紧张！空气窒人，医生、护士挥汗如雨。县人民医院负责医生解克勤等同志，经过紧张详细的会诊后，断定：
    “非用特效药‘二巯基丙醇’不可！必须在4日黎明前给病人注射这种药，否则无效！赶快派人去找！”
              就在同一个时间内
    县委会里，不安之夜。
    我们的郝书记，不停地吸着烟，守在电话机旁，他嘴角上的皱纹，更加深陷了。参加革命二十多年来，他养成了这样一种习惯：自个生病（他现在还患着关节炎），好像没那么回事，可乡亲们一有个头痛脑热，他就记着放不下，非想个法帮你治好心里才舒坦。何况，现在这六十一个同志，有的是生命危险！郝书记更加坐卧不安了。……这时候，他们接到了患者急需“二巯基丙醇”的电话，马上就派人去找。县人民医院的司药王文明和张寅虎，这两个小伙子连厚衣服也没顾得穿，两步并做一步走，跳过一道道深沟险壑，到三门峡市去找药。你看，这才叫真正的“司药员”，药房里没有的，他愿意经历千辛万苦，跑遍天涯海角，也要给你找到！
    他们来到了黄河茅津渡口，在微微的星光底下，只见那黄河翻滚着巨浪，只听那河水拍打岸头，声声震人心碎。这两个小青年，明明知道夜渡黄河容易翻船落水，极其危险，但是，为了挽救六十一位同志的生命，在这重要的时刻，就是天大的险，他们也心甘情愿去冒！他们毫不犹豫的去敲船工的门。船工从鼾睡中醒来：
    “敲门干什么？”
    “请摆我们渡河！”
    “黄河渡口，自古以来，夜不行船，等天亮吧！”
    “不能等！为了救人今夜非过河不可！”
    当船工们听说是为了挽救六十一个祖国建设者，老艄公王希坚，不顾今晚正发喘，猛然从热乎乎的被窝里跳了起来，系上搭禣，吆喝一声：“伙计们，走！”后面王云堂等几个人紧紧跟上。来到岸边，二话不说，驾起船，直奔河心。凭着与黄河巨浪搏斗了几十年的经验，凭着一颗颗赤诚的心，终于打破了黄河不夜渡的老例，把取药人安全送到了对岸。
    可是，三门峡市没有这种特效药！
    这已经是2月3日的中午了。时间啊，你停滞一会吧！你为什么老是从人们的身边嗖嗖地急驰而过，想挽也挽不住你……
    郝书记急切而坚定地指示：“我们还是应该就地解决。向运城县去找！向临汾县去找！向附近各地去找！”
    就在这时，张村公社医院又来了电话：“如果明晨以前拿不到‘二巯基丙醇’，十四名重患者，将会有死亡！”
    找药的电话，不断头的回来了：
    运城县没这种药！
    临汾县没这种药！
    附近各地都没这种药！
    郝书记斩钉截铁地说：“为了六十一位同志的生命，现在我们只好麻烦中央，向首都求援。向中央卫生部挂特急电话！向特药商店挂特急电话！”
    于是，这场紧张的抢救战，在二千里外的首都，接续着开始了……
      人心向北京，北京的心立刻和平陆的心一起跳动……
    2月3日，下午四时多，在卫生部
    在中华人民共和国卫生部的一所四合院里，药政管理局的许多同志，都停下了别的工作，忙办这件刻不容缓的事。药品器材处长江冰同志，在接到平陆县委打来的电话后，就一面叫人通知八面槽特种药品商店赶快准备药品，一面跑去请示局长和正在开党组会议的几位部长。徐运北副部长指示：一定要把这件事负责办好，立刻找民航局或请空军支援送药！
    现在，处里胖胖的老吴同志，头上汗水津津，正在紧张地向特种药品商店催药，共青团员冀钟昌正在与民航局联系；电话里传来的是不匀称的呼吸。显然对方也在焦急：
      “明天早晨，才有班机去太原，那太迟了，太迟了！……对啦，请求空军支援！”
    真急人，电话一个劲占线。当小冀接通了空军领导机关的电话时，空军已晓得了这件事。原来民航局先一步为此事打来了电话。这时，值班主任向小冀又进一步了解了卫生部的要求，立即跑去请示首长。首长指示：全力支援，要办得又快又好！于是，像开始了一场战斗一样，有关人员各就各位，研究航线，研究空投，向部队发出命令……这一切都办得十分神速，这一切都贯注着人民军队的光荣传统，都贯注着对人民极其深沉的爱！
    阶级友爱，情深似海。在我们中间，一个人发生困难，就有上百、上千、上万个素不相识的人，热切地向你伸出手，不遗余力地帮助你……
          现在，已经是下午五点多了
    从首都广安门外到八面槽的遥远路途中，穿过熙熙攘攘的人群，穿过川流不息的车辆，走过大街走小巷，一位三十来岁的工人，正冒着数九天的寒风，拼命地蹬着一辆载货自行车飞驰。
      “同志们，闪道，闪闪道！”
    他不断地向行人呼喊着。这车上拉的就是“二巯基丙醇”。骑车的叫王英浦，是位先进工作者。你看，他把车轮蹬得飞转，三十华里的路程，一个小时多就赶来了。干嘛要从三十里外运药来？这其中还有段小故事：
    这“二巯基丙醇”，原本是由国外进口的，算是一种稀有药品。可是去年大跃进中，我们的国营上海第一制药厂的工人，创造性地揭开了它的秘密，现在已能大量生产供应了。它再也不是什么稀罕玩艺，它的身价，已经从特种药品降为普通药品，所以特药商店刚刚把它送到库房去，准备发往各地普通医药公司经售。谁知现在又突然需要它，因此又拉了它回来。
    且说王英浦这时正喘吁吁地把药品搬进屋来，大家忽地围住他：
    “老王，你真是两条神仙腿呀！”
              就在同一个时间内
    我们的特种药品商店里，党支部书记田忱和共产党员何思鲁，正拿着电筒，伏在地图上，照啊，找啊，他们干什么呢？屋里明明亮着太阳灯，往常，针掉到地上都可以找到，可是今天却怎么也不够亮，噢，他们在找：平陆在哪？他们在想：到底如何运送？这些，迄今还都是悬案！
    正在这急死人的节骨眼上，卫生部又来了电话：
    “空军已热情支援，保证今夜把药品空投到平陆县城！请你们快把一千支药品装进木箱，箱外要装上发光设备……”
    有飞机啦！人们的心眼里，真像是久旱逢甘雨，兴奋得都跳起来了！但紧跟着又是一个困难：这发光设备可怎么解决呢？
              就在同一个时间内
    时间，一秒，一分，……一闪而过。现在距离4日清晨已经没几个小时了。
    在张村公社医院里，空气仍然异常紧张！张村公社的社员们，给自己的弟兄送来了大量豆腐、粉条、蔬菜、糖、细粮……这些东西堆在那里，有谁能吃呢？我们的弟兄还在危险中！山西省人民医院、临汾人民医院在听到这项紧急消息后，也都迅速派来了医生。现在，四十多位医护人员，头上冒着一串串的汗珠，他们已经二十来个小时没阖眼，为了延续这六十一条生命，土法、洋方，各式各样的招，都使尽了，可是病人还不见有何好转！！
    突然有人报告：“同志们，县委来电话说，中央已决定今晚派飞机送药来！”
    这是真的么？是真的！病人们那绝望的眼神，忽地亮了，人人的眼里，都饱含着无限感激的热泪……
            现在，时间将近晚上七点
    特药商店里，药品箱都快装好了，可是发光设备却还没个着落。这时，一个戴眼镜的姑娘，猛地把辫子一甩说：
    “我找五洲电料行去！”这人名叫李玉桥。
    她飞也似地来到了五光十色的五洲电料行。吓，这里真是顾客盈门，共青团员贺宜安在忙着给顾客拿这拿那。李玉桥简短地把情况跟小贺说完，问他：
    “给你三十分钟，能不能办好？”
    “放心吧，李大姐，坚决保证！”
    李玉桥帮他搞营业，小贺抬腿就去找人。半路上正好碰见了王明德，小王是北京市的先进生产者，更是一位热心肠的小伙子。他两急中生智，连跑带研究，真是一个踉跄一个智慧，他们想用四节电池焊在一起，接上灯泡，可亮半个多小时；又研究出用十六节电池、四个灯泡，把药箱的四面都装上灯，空投落地时，这一面的摔灭了，保险那几面的还亮着。说着说着，他们就干起来了。这时，正好门市部主任老杨从外面开会回来，一听说这是急事，也帮他们忙活起来。过了一会，李玉桥又来催：
    “时间紧迫，不能超过三分钟啦！”
    “我们保证两分半钟就弄好！”
    果真，李玉桥头脚走回商店，小王就带着焊好的发光设备，一溜风地也钻了进来，真是二分半钟啊！
            现在，是七点半钟以后
    一辆胜利牌小轿车，从卫生部大门里急驰出来，奔向特药商店。
    车子来了。这时候，正像老何事后所描绘的：也不知那一箱子药品，倒底是怎么拿出去的。只见大家一拥而上，生怕误了一分一秒的时间，生怕有个拿不住摔到地上，许多只手擎着这一千支“二巯基丙醇”，挤出商店的那狭小的门，轻轻地把它放在胜利牌小轿车最好的席位上！
    胜利牌轿车载着一千支“二巯基丙醇”，正在灯火辉煌的大街上，在静谧的京郊林荫大道上，响着喇叭，箭也似地向机场疾驰。
              就在同一个时间内
    平陆县邮政局的电话铃声一阵疾响。从下午三点开始，平陆——北京的长途电话已经成为一条极为敏捷的专线，这电话又是空军领导机关打来的。亲自守护在电话机旁的邮政局长董鸿亮同志，忙把电话接到县委会。郝书记接过电话，只听见：
      “请赶快物色一块平坦地带，要离河道远些准备四堆柴草。飞机一到，马上点火，做为空投标志！”
      “好！立即准备！”
    于是，书记、县长亲自指挥，有线广播站里传出来了最宏亮声音，向县城附近的机关、学校、人民公社，向几千几万群众，发出了县委、县人民委员会最紧急的号召。声音所到之处，正在学习拼音文字的干部们，撂下了书本跑出来，学生们从温课的教室里涌出来，老人们拄着拐杖走出来，新婚夫妇从温暖的新房中走出来，建设局的工人们，拖着废木碎柴往城外空地上跑；圣人涧那面的山坡上，又有一大群红旗公社的男女社员，抱着大捆大捆的棉柴芦苇，向这块平坦地势上奔来……
    眨眼间，岗尖岗尖的四大堆柴草已经准备好了！
    几千人林立在这块名叫圣人涧的空地上。人们满怀急不可耐的激动心情，向茫茫的夜空，向东北方向，不，向我们伟大的首都，了望着，了望着；人们的心早已经穿过了云层！曾经在部队上做过通讯工作的孙治勤同志，站在高高的山岗上，凭着他的经验，凭着他一双能听出十里以外的耳朵，倾听着飞机的动静……
      这是一场共产主义风格大发扬的胜利战斗。舍己为人、友爱互助精神万岁！
            现在，是夜里九点零三分
    北京，繁星满天。一架军用运输机，满载首都人民的深情厚谊，冲向银光闪闪的夜空，向西南方向风驰电掣地飞去。卫生部的陈寅卿同志随机前往。
    这是一次十分困难的飞行。夜间空投，在平陆空投场没有地面指挥和对空联络的情况下，加上地形复杂，山峦重重，空投的又是水剂药品，而且要保证做到万无一失。……部队领导对这次空投任务极为重视，政委、大队长、参谋长亲自研究，特别选派了最有经验的机长、领航长、通讯长和机械师，并且是一架飞机，派了两个机组同时前往。就在起飞之前，他们还选择了最好的降落伞，把药箱加了重，一切都筹划得最有把握，大家满怀着信心。
    一个飞行员十分激动地请求机长：“为了使药箱确保及时送到，我请求批准我跟着药箱一起下去！”
    机长说：“首长已经指示，人不要下去，我们要保证把药品准确投到！”
    现在，我们的雄鹰正在高速航行。下面是茫茫大地，祖国到处是不夜城，繁星与万家灯火交相辉映，这时候，有多少人，还在辛勤地为祖国劳动着！
        现在，是夜里十一点二十三分
    “请平陆准备！准备！飞机再有七分钟就到你县，马上点火！”
    董局长把这空军领导机关的电话通知，立刻传给守候飞机的人群，不知是谁，向每堆柴草上泼了一些煤油，火苗冲天而起，大火把天空和大地都照红了！
    这时，飞机已越过黄河，来到平陆上空。现在飞机的高度是二千七百米，为了空投的准确，必须降低，越低越准！机长周连珊压了压操纵杆，飞机迅速下降，二千、一千五、一千……五百米，巍峨的山影从机身旁掠过，好危险哪！这是一场勇敢加技术的搏斗！
    飞机上的全部人员，双眼睁得彪圆，心情极不平静！机长突然兴奋地命令：
    “准备空投！”
    保伞员、机械师还有小陈，早就把药箱上的电灯接亮了，只听电铃一响，他们嗖地一声准确地把药箱推出机舱，一千支“二巯基丙醇”带着降落伞，向预定空投地点坠下去，坠下去！……由县委打电话向北京求援，到神药从天而降，这其中牵动了多少单位，牵动了多少人，可是这全部复杂辗转的过程，却只用了八个多小时，这是多么惊人的高速度！
    我们不是常说：“千里送鹅毛，礼轻人意重”么，这一箱从天而降的神药啊，盛满了首都无数人的最美好
  的感情，它比泰山还重！
            就在同一个时间内
    在平陆县城外的圣人涧，四大堆火越烧越旺。人流如春潮，数不清的手电光点缀着夜空，活像国庆夜首都天安门的探照灯光。郝书记、郭县长等都亲赴现场来了。
    “看，天上有个亮灯下来了！”突然谁叫。
    “那是降落伞，那是神药！”
    几千双手高高地举起来，谁都想把这一箱药擎住！人们向飞机、向降落伞此起彼伏的欢呼！
    降落伞带着闪闪的亮灯向下飘落！人流追踪着降落伞飘落，跑啊！跑啊！郭逢恒县长向降落伞跑去，劈面碰见了蒲剧演员杨果娃，这是个十六岁的女孩，唱小旦的。她的脸上还抹着红红的粉，戏装也没卸，全是舞台上那个打扮呢！
    “果娃！你怎么也跑来啦！”郭县长问她。
    “看戏的人都来啦，我怎么不来，来接毛主席送来的神药哇！”说着她又赶忙向降落伞跑去。
    降落伞带着药箱安全地着陆了，安在药箱四角的电灯闪闪地亮着，寨头管理区的社员最先抱住了药箱！几千人簇拥着这一箱药，你刚扛了两步，他抢过去又扛在肩上……
    交通局派来的一辆最好的汽车，最好的司机沈宽亮，早已等在县委会门口。药箱放在车上，车就大开油门，向五十里外的张村医院飞奔。俗话说：平陆不平沟三千，这里的山路狭窄崎岖，极端难行，汽车随时都可能发生故障抛锚。沈宽亮早把汽车做了最好的检修，可是他还在想：
    “万一出了毛病，我就扛着它送去！”
              2月3日，深夜
    盼！盼！——在张村公社医院的大门口，社员们，医护人员们正焦急地盼望着……
    汽车开来了！——好！
    马上拿下药箱，
    马上注射。
    注射剂十分灵效，立竿见影，病人立时止住了疼痛，恢复了神智。医生原来规定，药品不能迟于4日黎明找到，但这药品却在黎明之前就送到了。我们的六十一个阶级弟兄化险为夷了。他们新的更强壮的生命，是党给予的，是同志们用阶级友爱救活的。狂喜从人们的心底里迸发出来……
    不仅仅是这六十一个死而复生的人，不，我们每个人都有两次生命。党用它思想的阳光，帮助我们消除旧时代遗留给我们的思想毒菌，抚育我们成为全新的人。
                  2月5日
    红日高照，春光灿烂。
    县委书记处书记兼县长郭逢恒及县里其它几位领导同志，代表县委会和全县人民，率领着县文工团，携带着慰问品，来到了张村公社医院。他们亲自到床边抚慰病人。郭县长见病人已恢复了健康，打心眼里高兴。民工们紧紧地拉住了郭县长的手，不知说啥是好。
    民工周满禄，眼眶里噙满滚热的泪，他说：
    “万恶的日本鬼子打瞎了咱一只眼，没人管；国民党阎老西杀了咱多少人，苦水往肚里咽！今天，咱这些普通民工闹点病，中央就派飞机救咱们，党和毛主席真是咱贴心的人啊！”
    张店公社的老汉吴进喜，从八十里外赶来看他的儿子吴广新。这时他激动得混身抖动，拉着儿子：
    “小子，在咱这偏僻山沟子里，我想你是没救啦！谁想毛主席在北京比咱老汉还关心我儿！小子，毛主席才真是你的亲爹娘！”
    当场，大家都再也躺不住，纷纷爬起来，向郭县长请求：
    “为了感谢党和毛主席，感谢首都人民的支援，我们明天就上工！”
    郭县长慰抚他们说：“你们要听党的话，好好休息几天！”
    第一连连长怎也按不住心里的那股冲劲，攥着两只粗大的拳头，代表全连的民工向郭县长表示：
    “我们一连全体向党和毛主席保证：鼓起最大干劲，把第三连的工全部包下来！”
  紧跟着，大家在公社医院的里里外外，在工地上，贴出了几百张大字报表决心；写给党中央和毛主席的信，更像雪片般飞来……
    民工们真是说到做到，他们一上工，就由过去每天挖十五方土，增加到挖三十方，工效提高一倍。有的人，更是一天干了三天的活！大家决心提前三个月修好这条支援三门峡伟大建设工程的公路，无数的奇迹在创造着！……
    不仅仅是我们的这些筑路民工，不，十二万平陆人，不，六亿五千万中国人，人人心里都燃着一团烈火，这团烈火越烧越旺：对党和毛主席的深沉热爱，化做无穷无尽的力量，人们正在用它加速建设我们伟大的社会主义祖国！干劲冲天地、高速度地建设她吧，这是咱们的靠山，这是咱们永远幸福的保证！（附图片）
    医生们断定：“非用特效药‘二巯基丙醇’不可！……”
