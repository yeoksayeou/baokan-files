This newspaper reports: The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has already had one million water conservancy workers shift to spring planting production. With the accelerated completion of water conservancy finishing work, the remaining labor force is also being transferred in succession.

Guangxi's winter and spring water conservancy construction has completed about 80% of the earth and stone work, which is twice as fast as the progress of winter water conservancy construction in previous years. This ensures that the main labor force can be transferred to spring planting production before the spring farming rush, so that the spring planting production upsurge closely follows the water conservancy construction upsurge.

When transferring labor, all localities adhere to the principle of "how much task, how many people to keep," and transfer them in a planned and phased manner. This prevents the water conservancy tail from holding back the center, and also avoids leaving a large tail in the project that cannot benefit from spring planting. The masses have high enthusiasm for labor in spring planting production. For example, after repairing basic water conservancy projects, Laibin County immediately organized forces to accumulate fertilizer and reclaim wasteland, and planted 600,000 mu of various crops in a very short period of time. Pingguo County has transferred its main force from the water conservancy construction site into spring planting production, resulting in an upsurge in planting corn throughout the county, and it has already overfulfilled its plan for spring planting corn.

    广西春耕战线兵强马壮
    百万水利大军转入春耕部分地区出现春种高潮
    本报讯　广西僮族自治区已有一百万水利大军转入春耕生产。随着水利扫尾工作的加速进行，其余劳动力也在陆续转移中。
    广西去冬今春水利建设约80％的土石方工作量已经完成，比历年冬修水利的进度加快一倍。从而保证了春耕大忙以前就能够把主要劳动力转移到春耕生产方面来，使水利兴修的高潮之后紧接着春耕生产的高潮。
    在劳动力转移的时候，各地本着“有多大任务留多少人”的原则，有计划地分期分批地转移。既不让水利尾巴拖住中心，也避免了工程留下很大尾巴，不能在春耕受益。群众在春耕生产中的劳动热情很高。比如，来宾县在大修水利基本完成后，紧接着组织力量积肥、开荒，很短时间内就种下了各种作物六十万亩。平果县由于从水利工地调动了主力投入春耕生产，全县立即出现了种玉米的热潮，目前已超额完成了春种玉米计划。
