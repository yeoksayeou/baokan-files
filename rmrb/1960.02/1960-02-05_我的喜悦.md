    My Joy
    I was an apprentice at the Beijing Wire Factory in 1958. Although I had already graduated from junior high school, my cultural and technical knowledge was far from sufficient for this modern industrial production; picking up blueprints was like a goat looking at an advertisement – I understood nothing. I couldn't do anything without my master. In order to cultivate me, the factory leadership sent me to the factory's secondary technical school to study for three years last year.
    I am not good at speaking, let alone a writer, and it is difficult to express my joy in words. I only know that we are growing up in the Mao Zedong era and have a broad path in life. I once heard my master say that when he was an apprentice in the past, he was beaten and scolded, didn't have enough to eat or wear, and going to school was something he wouldn't even dare to think about. But today, in our country, this kind of "thing that you wouldn't even dare to think about" has become extremely common. I am determined to become both a red and expert laborer and dedicate my youth to the country's industrialization.

    我的喜悦
    我是一九五八年考入北京有线电厂的学徒工。我虽已经初中毕了业，但在这现代化的工业生产上，文化技术知识远远不够用；拿起了图纸就像山羊看广告一样什么也不懂。事事离不开师傅。工厂领导为了培养我，去年把我送到工厂的中等技术学校去学习三年。
    我不善于讲话，更不是作家，很难用词句表达我的喜悦。我只知道，我们生长在毛泽东时代，有着宽阔的生活道路。我曾听我师傅说，他过去当学徒挨打受骂，吃不饱、穿不暖，上学，则是想都不敢想的事。但是今天，在我们的国家里，这种“想都不敢想的事”已经极普遍了。我下了决心要成为又红又专的劳动者，为国家工业化献出自己的青春。
