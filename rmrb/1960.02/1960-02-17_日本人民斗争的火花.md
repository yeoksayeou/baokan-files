Sparks of the Japanese People's Struggle

New Year's Cards

In Japan, New Year's cards in 1960 took on a new dimension. Many people used the method of sending New Year's cards to express their fighting spirit and determination to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The editorial department of the "Akahata" newspaper received a large number of such New Year's cards. For example, a New Year's card sent from a reader in Mizusawa City, Iwate Prefecture, used the unique title "Notes from the New Year's Zodiac Meeting," recording the conversation of the twelve zodiac animals in a personified form. Here are a few excerpts:

Rat: "This year, we must sever the chains of subordination to the United States!"

Rabbit: "We can no longer agree to using rabbit skin for war."

Goat: "The weak uniting can defeat the jackals and wolves."

Slide Show

A cinema called "Meigetsu-za" in Otsuki City, Yamanashi Prefecture, has been showing a slide titled "Oppose the Revision of the 'Security Treaty' that Destroys People's Lives" before each film screening since early December last year. The original manuscript for this slide was drawn by Communist Party member Toshiku Kobayashi. A missile with the words "Nuclear Armament" written on it lies across the middle of the screen. In the very center of the missile is a half-length portrait of a fierce-looking, glaring monopoly capitalist, holding a bag of dollars in his right hand and a woman in his left. To his left is a group of clowns representing the government, reactionary members of parliament, and fascist groups; to his right is a large mushroom cloud from an atomic bomb explosion. Below the missile are a starving, freezing mother and child.

This slide caused a sensation throughout Otsuki City. By January 10th of this year, more than 20,000 spectators had come to watch it. This greatly inspired the fighting will of the people of Otsuki City against the "Security Treaty."

Hiking Boots

Among the members of the "Grand March for the Realization of the Demand for the Return of Okinawa" that set out from Kagoshima on January 24th, there was a representative from Okinawa named Tamaki. He was wearing ordinary sneakers, which made walking very inconvenient.

On January 31st, members of the Kagoshima Telegraph Bureau's Peace Committee who were participating in the grand march entered Kumamoto Prefecture. Seeing Tamaki's difficulty walking, they, together with some members of the Minamata City branch of the "Zenden Tsushin" (All Japan Telecommunications Workers' Union), raised money in Minamata City to buy a pair of hiking boots and gave them to Tamaki. Tamaki was very grateful for the warm care of the people of the motherland. He resolved to wear these hiking boots to overcome all obstacles and contribute all his strength to the struggle for the return of Okinawa to the embrace of the motherland.

Kites

Not long ago, the city of Ogaki in Gifu Prefecture, Japan, under the auspices of the "Seino Joint Struggle Conference to Stop the Revision of the 'Security Treaty'," held a kite flying competition at the municipal stadium. The slogan of this conference was: "Appeal from the Sky to Stop the Revision of the 'Security Treaty'!"

The unions of "Nippon Gosei Kagaku" (Japan Synthetic Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.), "Omi Silk Spinning Co., Ltd.," "Nippon Textile Co., Ltd.," "Teikoku Fiber Co., Ltd.," and other companies participating in the "Joint Struggle Conference," as well as the All Japan Express Co. Union and the All Japan Day Laborers' Union, and other affiliated unions, made a large number of kites to participate in the competition. The kites were emblazoned with slogans such as "Oppose the Revision of the 'Security Treaty'" and "Oppose War." These kites soared in the sky, demonstrating the lofty aspirations of the Japanese people to strive for independence, peace, and democracy. (Compiled by Cong Shan)

    日本人民斗争的火花
    贺年片
    在日本，1960年的贺年片有了新的内容。很多人用寄贺年片的方式，互相表达自己争取废除日美“安全条约”的斗志和决心。
    “赤旗报”编辑部就收到了大批这一类的贺年片。例如，寄自岩手县水泽市一读者的贺年片，用“新春十二支会谈抄”这样一个别具风味的题目，以拟人格化的形式，记录了十二支的谈话。其中有几段是：
    子鼠：“今年一定要斩断从属美国的锁链！”
    卯兔：“再也不能答应把兔子皮用于战争了。”
    未羊：“弱者团结起来可以打败豺狼。”
    幻灯画
    山梨县大月市一家叫做“明月座”的电影院从去年12月上旬起在放映影片以前放映了一幅题为“反对破坏人民生活的修改‘安全条约’”的幻灯画。这幅幻灯画的原稿，是共产党员小林利久画的。横在画面中间的是一个写有“核武装”字样的导弹。导弹上面正中央是一个凶眉怒目的大垄断资本家的半身像，右手握着一只盛着美元的钱袋，左手握着一个女人。他的左边是政府、反动议员、法西斯团体的一群小丑；右边是一个原子弹爆炸的大烟柱。导弹下面，是饥寒交迫的母亲和孩子。
    这幅幻灯画轰动了整个大月市。到今年1月10日止，共有两万多观众前来观看。这大大激励了大月市人民反对“安全条约”的斗争意志。
    登山鞋
    在日本人民1月24日从鹿儿岛出发的“争取实现归还冲绳要求大游行”的队伍中，有一位来自冲绳的代表玉城。他穿的是普通的运动鞋，行走起来很不方便。
    1月31日，参加大游行的鹿儿岛电报局的和平委员会的会员进入了熊本县。他们看到玉城走路吃力，于是在水俣市，联合“全电通”工会水俣市分会的一些会员们募款买了一双登山鞋，送给了玉城。玉城对于祖国人民的热情照顾十分感激。他决心穿着这双登山鞋踏破一切障碍，为争取冲绳重返祖国怀抱而贡献自己的全部力量。
    风筝
    不久前，日本岐阜县大垣市在“阻止修改‘安全条约’西浓共同斗争会议”的主持下，在市立体育场举行了放风筝比赛大会。这次大会的口号是：“从空中呼吁阻止修改‘安全条约’！”
    参加“共同斗争会议”的“日本合成化学”公司、“近江纺丝”公司、“日本纺织”公司、“帝国纤维”公司的各工会以及全日本通运公司工会、全日本散工工会等所属工会，制作了大批的风筝参加比赛大会。风筝上面都有“反对修改‘安全条约’”、
  “反对战争”等标语口号。这些风筝在天空翱翔，显示了日本人民争取独立、和平、民主的凌云壮志。　　　（丛山辑）
