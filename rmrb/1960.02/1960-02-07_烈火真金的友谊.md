    Friendship Tempered in Fire
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Kong Mai
    At the northern end of L Street in Havana, the capital of Cuba, stands a cylindrical monument more than two meters high. On the dark marble base is inscribed:
    "Not one Chinese in Cuba was a deserter, not one was a traitor."
    This is the inscription by General Gonzalo, a close comrade-in-arms of Cuban national hero José Martí, praising the Cuban Chinese for their heroic participation in the 1895 War of Independence against Spanish colonial rule and their immortal feats. In Cuba, wherever you go, you can hear this highly friendly assessment of the Chinese. Some Cuban friends—including officers and soldiers of the rebel army, young students and professors, as well as workers, farmers, and businessmen—told me this famous saying the first time we met, which made us feel like old friends at first sight and particularly cordial.
    The Chinese have a long history of coming to Cuba. More than a hundred years ago, people from Guangdong and Fujian provinces along the Chinese coast sailed across the ocean to this distant Caribbean island nation. At that time, China was suffering from deep disasters under imperialist aggression and the corrupt rule of the Qing government, and many coastal residents fled overseas to make a living. The Spanish colonists who ruled Cuba desperately needed labor to develop mineral resources after exterminating the local Indians. They encountered difficulties in trafficking black slaves from Africa, so they recruited Chinese laborers in Hong Kong, Macau, and other places and sold them to Cuba. According to records, from 1847 to 1859, more than 50,000 Chinese laborers were lured and sold into slavery. They were packed in crowded, suffocating cabins, with excrement and vomit all mixed together. Whips, chains, ropes, and wooden sticks tormented them. The ships tossed in stormy waves, and countless people died of hunger and disease. Their bodies were thrown into the vast sea. According to materials, among these batches of unfortunate Chinese laborers who left their hometowns, more than 7,622 died en route, accounting for more than 15% of the total. However, for the colonists, this was still more cost-effective than trafficking black people from Africa, because the loss from there often reached 30%. Therefore, the industry of trafficking Chinese laborers "flourished." In Havana, Manila, Macau, and Hong Kong, newly established human trafficking companies were constantly increasing. Their ships flew the banner of "agricultural development."
    As soon as the Chinese laborers landed in Cuba, they signed and fingerprinted contracts written in a combination of Chinese and Spanish, and from then on began a life of slavery without light. The reporter obtained a shocking Chinese labor contract from 1865, which stated: "It is stated that the hired laborers in Cuba listen to the employer's use. If the contract is transferred to another person, I (referring to the Chinese laborer who signed the contract) will only obey the order of the contract holder." The clause stipulated a term of eight years. The Chinese laborers only received four yuan in wages per month, but "I will obey and work hard for all kinds of projects inside and outside the city, whether it is in fields, villages, homes, hired labor in the industry, mills, or gardens." Some contracts even stipulated the maximum "limit" for beatings with large boards each year. After signing the indenture, the Chinese laborers were taken to plantations and mines surrounded by barbed wire. Driven by rifles, bayonets, and whips, they endured hunger and worked day and night, year after year, engaging in slave labor, nourishing the Spanish colonists with their blood and sweat. Many people committed suicide in despair to escape this endless suffering. According to a material, the death rate of Chinese laborers before the expiration of the contract often reached more than 70%.
    The blood and sweat of overseas Chinese, Cubans, and trafficked African blacks flowed together, condensing into deep friendship, and their miserable fate closely linked them together.
    On October 10, 1868, in the fields of the Yara region, slaves of different races could no longer bear it and, regardless of the colonists' nooses and bayonets, raised the banner of resistance against the Spanish colonists for the first time. Upon hearing the news, Chinese workers immediately joined the ranks of the insurgents. There were not many overseas Chinese in eastern Cuba, but almost all of them participated in the insurgent forces, and some even became commanders. In the long and arduous struggle, all the Chinese in the insurgent forces fought very bravely and outstandingly. General Gonzalo recalled in his book "The Chinese and Cuban Independence": "Not a single Chinese in Cuba did not embrace the cause of freedom. In the tragic war for national independence in Cuba, the Chinese fought on the battlefield like fierce beasts. They contributed everything in the factories to improve the combat conditions of the soldiers. They endured all hunger and hardship in the war. Once captured, they regarded death as home and sacrificed heroically. They generously shed their last drop of nameless blood for Cuban independence. They neither harbored any desire to pursue personal fame and gain, nor did they ever seek to receive bouquets of gratitude." In his book, the author enthusiastically praised the outstanding feats of the Chinese soldiers in the famous Battle of Minadetuula: at that time, the Chinese troops were ordered to guard the left flank, and the Spanish colonial army launched a fierce pincer offensive. The Chinese soldiers bravely rushed towards the enemy and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the most elite and well-trained Spanish troops. They roared Chinese slogans and smashed the heads of the enemies with the butts of rifles, forcing them to retreat.
    The overseas Chinese troops were the largest in Las Villas Province. Each of them was outstandingly brave, making the enemy tremble with fear. Gonzalo described the heroic images of several Chinese soldiers. For example, Huang Dias, with a small Chinese-style mustache, participated in every battle. When he finally died heroically, he kissed the blood-stained Cuban flag with deep affection.
    Second Lieutenant Kang Jiale was good at using spare time to study on his own and later became an excellent officer and organizer of the insurgent forces. When he was seriously wounded and captured, he glared at the enemy and said, "I am a second lieutenant of the Cuban Liberation Army. Kill me if you want!"
    Second Lieutenant Pio Cabrera always took on the most difficult tasks. In one battle, he was ordered to cover the retreat of the main force. His thigh was shot through by a bullet, but he lay down in the pool of blood and continued to shoot at the approaching fifty or so enemies. When the bullets ran out, the enemy rushed up. He mustered all his strength to stand up, raised his gun, and threw it fiercely at the enemy. More than ten bullets simultaneously shot into the heart of this Chinese hero...
    Many stories about the Chinese bravely participating in the 1895 War of Independence are circulated among the Cuban people. Elderly Cubans can still name seventeen overseas Chinese heroes who were awarded the supreme honor of national presidential candidacy for their outstanding military exploits. Under General Tias, there was a Chinese doctor named Li Baoli (transliteration), who was the general's most trusted assistant. Because of his outstanding intelligence, courage, and great spirit of selflessness, he was loved by the majority of officers and soldiers. A Cuban president once praised him with these words: "This Chinese is a model of patriotism and loyalty."
    According to Raúl Castro, Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba, there are no less than 20,000 to 30,000 overseas Chinese in Cuba. They have worked hard with the Cuban people for generations. Many overseas Chinese have opened food stores, restaurants, laundries, and grocery stores. Some grow vegetable gardens and open flour mills. Some overseas Chinese have married Cuban women, raised children, and joined Cuban nationality. Some of the glorious ranks of the Cuban People's Socialist Party are also overseas Chinese and their descendants. A prominent martyr of the People's Socialist Party named José Huang was a young overseas Chinese from Fujian. His original name was Huang Taobai, and he was one of the secretaries of the Cuban Socialist Youth League. In 1931, he was arrested and imprisoned by the Machado government. He led political studies in prison and continued to fight against the enemy. Later, he was despicably killed in prison by the Kuomintang pseudo-envoy Wei Lingbing in collusion with the reactionary government. He was only thirty years old when he sacrificed himself.
    In the armed struggle against the Batista tyranny, progressive overseas Chinese youth not only actively participated in supporting the July 26th Movement led by Castro, but some also risked their lives to transport food and ammunition to the rebel army through heavy blockades and police checkpoints. Among the Cuban revolutionary army officers and soldiers with big beards, many are also descendants of overseas Chinese.
    The Chinese district of Havana is where overseas Chinese live. The shops and teahouses there completely retain Chinese flavors. On a corner of the street, a banner is hung with the words: "Cuban Overseas Chinese New Democratic League." This is a patriotic overseas Chinese organization. An old overseas Chinese man who had been persecuted and imprisoned several times by the Machado reactionary government excitedly recounted to me the struggle of patriotic overseas Chinese who, despite the Kuomintang embassy colluding with officials to carry out suppression, raised the five-star red flag of the motherland for the first time on National Day in 1950. More than thirty people were arrested and imprisoned in this struggle.
    "All reactionaries, no matter how rampant they are, are bound to fail," the old man said meaningfully.
    After the victory of the Cuban Revolution, overseas Chinese and the Cuban people simultaneously gained freedom. They, like the Cuban people, wholeheartedly support the revolutionary government and love the rebel army. In the national upsurge of donating tractors to support land reform and raising funds to buy aircraft and weapons to support the revolutionary army against American interference and defend the revolution, the overseas Chinese also responded enthusiastically.
    This year on New Year's Day, the national flags of China and Cuba were raised at the headquarters of the "Cuban Overseas Chinese New Democratic League." Cuban friends and overseas Chinese, men, women, old and young, gathered together to listen to the "Rebel Army Radio" broadcast a special program of the Chinese people congratulating Cuba on the New Year. Amidst friendly laughter, people stepped into 1960 hand in hand, full of victorious confidence. The deep friendship between the Chinese expatriates and the Cuban people, which has been tested and forged in long-term common labor and struggle, is evergreen like the palm trees here.

    烈火真金的友谊
    新华社记者　孔迈
    在古巴首都哈瓦那L街的北端，屹立着一座二丈多高的圆柱形纪念碑。墨色的大理石的碑座上铭刻着：
    “在古巴的中国人，没有一个是逃兵，没有一个是叛徒”
    这是古巴民族英雄何塞·马蒂的亲密战友冈萨洛将军褒奖古巴华侨在1895年反对西班牙殖民统治的独立战争中英勇参战建立了不朽功勋的题词。在古巴，无论你走到哪里，都可以听到这个对中国人的崇高友谊的评价。一些古巴朋友——其中有起义军军官和士兵、青年学生和教授，也有工人、农民和商人——在第一次见面时就告诉我这句名言，这使我们之间立即相见如故，格外亲切。
    中国人来到古巴，已有悠久的历史。在一百多年前，中国沿海的广东、福建人就已飘洋过海，来到这遥远的加勒比海的岛国。那时，中国在帝国主义侵略和清朝政府的腐败统治下，灾难深重，民不聊生，沿海居民逃亡海外谋生的很多。统治着古巴的西班牙殖民者，在灭绝了当地的印第安人之后，迫切需要劳动力开发矿源。他们从非洲贩运黑人奴隶遭到了困难，于是就在香港和澳门等地招募华工，贩卖到古巴。据记载，从1847年到1859年间，被诱骗和贩卖的华工奴隶就有五万多人。他们被装在拥挤窒息的船舱里，便溺呕吐全在一起。皮鞭、锁链、麻绳、木棍折磨着他们，船在狂风巨浪里颠簸着，饿死病死的人何止千百。他们的尸体被抛到茫茫的大海里。有材料说，在这几批不幸背井离乡的华工中，死在中途的达七千六百二十二人，占总数的15％以上。但是，对殖民者来说，这仍然比从非洲贩运黑人合算，因为从那里贩运奴隶，损失往往达30％。因此，贩卖华工的行业“兴隆”了起来。在哈瓦那、马尼拉、澳门、香港，新设的人口贩卖公司在不断增加。他们的船只打着“开发农业”的旗号。
    华工们一在古巴登岸，就在中西文合璧的合同上签字画押，从此开始了暗无天日的奴隶生涯。记者得到一份1865年的触目惊心的华工合同，上面写着：“言明在古巴洲雇工听从事主使用，如将合同转交别人，我（指签定合同的华工）只听从执合同人使令。”条文规定期限八年。华工每月只得四元工银，但“所有城内城外无论何工，或田亩、或村庄、或家中使唤、或行内雇工、或磨房、或园圃指不尽各项工程，我悉听从力作”。有的合同甚至规定了每年挨打的大板的最高“限额”。华工们签定卖身契以后就被带到围有铁丝网的种植园和矿场里。在来福枪、刺刀和皮鞭的驱使下，他们忍饥挨饿，夜以继日，年复一年地从事奴隶劳动，以自己的血汗养肥了西班牙殖民者。多少人在绝望中自杀，以便摆脱这无尽的苦难。据一份材料说，华工在合同期满前死亡的往往达70％以上。
    华侨和古巴人、被贩运的非洲黑人的血汗流在一起，凝结成深厚的友谊，苦难的命运把他们紧紧地联结在一起。
    1868年10月10日，在亚拉地区的田野上，不同种族的奴隶们忍无可忍，不顾殖民者的绞索和刺刀，首次举起了反抗西班牙殖民者的战旗。中国工人闻讯马上投奔起义者的行列。古巴东部的华侨不多，但他们几乎全部都参加了起义部队，有的还当了指挥员。在漫长的艰苦的搏斗中，所有起义部队中的中国人都战斗得很英勇、出色。冈萨洛将军在他写的一本“中国人与古巴独立”的书中回忆道：“在古巴的中国人没有一个不曾拥抱过自由的事业。在古巴争取民族独立的悲壮的战争中，中国人像猛兽一样在战场上搏斗。他们曾在工厂里为改善士兵的战斗条件贡献一切。他们曾在战争中忍受了一切饥饿和困苦。当他们一旦被俘，又视死如归，壮烈牺牲。他们为古巴独立慷慨地流尽了自己最后一滴不留名的鲜血。他们既不抱任何追求个人名利的欲望，也从不企求得到感谢的花束。”作者在他的书中热情地歌颂了中国战士在著名的米纳德图拉战役中的出色战功：当时华侨的队伍奉命守卫着左翼阵地，西班牙殖民军发动了猛烈的钳形攻势。华侨战士勇猛扑向敌军，和最精锐善战的西班牙军队展开了肉搏战。他们怒吼着中国口号，用来福枪枪柄砸碎敌人的脑袋，迫使他们后退。
    华侨部队在拉斯维利亚斯省最多。他们个个都骁勇出众，令敌胆寒。冈萨洛描绘了几个华侨战士的英雄形象。例如，蓄着中国式细小八字胡的黄迪亚斯，他每次战役都参加，当他最后英勇牺牲时，带着深情吻着血染的古巴国旗。
    少尉康家乐，善于利用空隙时间自学，后来成为起义部队优秀的军官和组织者，他在伤重被俘时昂头怒视敌人说：“我是古巴解放军少尉，你们要杀就杀吧！”
    少尉皮奥·卡布雷拉，总是担任最困难的任务。在一次战役中他奉命掩护主力撤退，大腿被子弹射穿，但他在血泊中卧倒向进逼的五十多个敌人继续射击，当子弹打完，敌人扑上来，他鼓起全身力气站起来，举起枪向敌人猛掷过去，不止十颗子弹同时射向这个中国英雄的心……
    古巴民间流传着许多关于中国人英勇参加1895年独立战争的故事。年老的古巴人还能数出十七位华侨英雄的名字，他们由于卓越的战功而被授予国家总统候选权的无上荣誉。在蒂阿斯将军麾下有个名叫李宝力（译音）的中国医生，他是将军最亲信的助手。由于智勇出众和舍己为人的伟大精神，他受到了广大官兵的爱戴。有一位古巴总统曾用这样的话称赞他：“这个中国人是一个爱国主义和忠诚的典范。”
    据古巴革命武装部部长劳尔·卡斯特罗估计，在古巴的华侨不下二三万人。他们世世代代和古巴人民一起辛勤劳动。有不少华侨开设食品店、饭店、洗衣店和杂货店。有的种植菜园、开设磨坊粉厂。有些华侨和古巴妇女结了婚，养育子女，并且加入了古巴国籍。在古巴人民社会党的光荣行列中也有一些是华侨和他们的后裔。一位杰出的名叫何塞·黄的人民社会党烈士就是原籍福建的华侨青年。他原名黄淘白，是古巴社会主义青年联盟的书记之一。1931年，被马查多政府逮捕入狱。他在狱中领导政治学习，继续同敌人展开斗争，后来被国民党伪公使魏凌冰勾结反动政府在狱中卑鄙地杀害了，牺牲时才三十岁。
    在反对巴蒂斯塔暴政的武装斗争中，进步华侨青年不但积极参加了支援卡斯特罗领导的7月26日运动，有的还冒着生命危险，通过重重的封锁和军警岗哨，给起义军运送粮草弹药。在蓄着大胡子的古巴革命军的军官和士兵中，也有许多是华侨子弟。
    哈瓦那的中国区是华侨聚居的地方。那儿的商店、茶馆完全保持着中国风味。在市街的一角，挂着一幅横幕，上书：“古巴华侨新民主同盟”。这是爱国华侨的团体。一个曾数次被马查多反动政府迫害下狱的华侨老人向我兴奋地叙述了爱国华侨不顾蒋帮公使馆勾结官府进行镇压，在1950年国庆节第一次升起了祖国五星红旗的斗争经过。三十多人在这次斗争中被捕下狱。
    “一切反动派，不管他们多么猖狂，总是要失败的。”老人意味深长地说。
    古巴革命胜利后，华侨和古巴人民同时获得了自由。他们和古巴人民一样衷心拥护革命政府，热爱起义军。在古巴全国捐献拖拉机支援土地改革和募款购买飞机武器支援革命军反对美国干涉保卫革命的热潮中，华侨也热烈响应。
    今年元旦，“古巴华侨新民主同盟”的会址上，升起了中国和古巴的国旗。古巴朋友和华侨们男女老少，会聚一堂，收听“起义军电台”播送的中国人民祝贺古巴的新年特别节目。在一片友好的欢笑声中，人们满怀着胜利的信心，手携手地跨进了1960年。中国侨民和古巴人民久经考验的、在长期的共同劳动和战斗中结成的深厚友谊，像这里的棕榈树那样四季常青。
