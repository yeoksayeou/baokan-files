    Unforgettable Visit
    Chen Shuzhen, Head of the “March 8th” People’s Commune, Su County, Anhui Province

    February 14th marks the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. Over the past ten years, with the help of our Soviet elder brother, our various undertakings have developed rapidly and achieved remarkable results. Last November, I participated in the Chinese Women's Delegation to the Soviet Union, and had the honor of attending the celebration ceremony of the 42nd anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union, and visited many places. During this period, I witnessed the tremendous achievements of the Soviet people over the past forty-two years, and the new achievements made by the Soviet people in the first year of implementing the Seven-Year Plan. Although this visit was short, it left me with deep and unforgettable impressions everywhere.

    In the Soviet Union, I saw their rural production and construction, and the lives of the people.

    The Soviet countryside is simply like a small city. Take the "21st Party Congress" Collective Farm in the Ukrainian Republic that we visited as an example. It has beautiful houses, tidy streets, and the farm has a bakery, winery, hospital, club, school, kindergarten, etc.

    The production of this farm has been fully mechanized, and their water conservancy irrigation has also been fully mechanized. Two-thirds of the farm's land is supplied with water from the Kakhovka Hydropower Station, and one-third of the land uses pumps for irrigation. They are not afraid of floods or droughts. Thanks to good cultivation, sufficient fertilizer, and convenient irrigation, the yield of crops is very high.

    The mechanization of Soviet collective farms and the happiness of the members did not come easily. This is the result of the long-term hard work of the Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party. All members of our "March 8th" People's Commune must, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant light of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, summon up revolutionary vigor, seize the key to production, and strive for a greater and better leap forward in 1960.

    难忘的访问
    安徽省宿县“三八”人民公社社长　陈淑贞
    2月14日是中苏友好同盟互助条约签订十周年的日子。十年来，我们在苏联老大哥的帮助下，各项事业都有了飞跃的发展，并取得了显著成就。去年11月，我参加了中国妇女访苏代表团，光荣地参加了苏联十月社会主义革命四十二周年庆祝典礼，又到很多地方参观访问。在这期间，我看到了苏联人民四十二年来的巨大成就，看到了苏联人民在执行七年计划第一年所取得的新成绩。虽然这次访问为期很短，可是各处都给我留下了深刻难忘的印象。
    在苏联，我看到了他们的农村生产建设和人民的生活。
    苏联的农村简直像是小城市。就拿我们参观的乌克兰共和国“第二十一次党代会”集体农庄来说吧，它有漂亮的房屋，整齐的街道，农庄里有面包厂、制酒厂、医院、俱乐部、学校、幼儿园等。
    这个农庄的生产全部实现了机械化，他们的水利灌溉也全部机械化了，全庄有三分之二的土地用卡霍夫卡水电站供水、有三分之一的土地使用抽水机灌溉。既不怕涝，又不怕旱，由于耕作好，肥料足、灌溉便利，农作物产量很高。
    苏联集体农庄的机械化和庄员们的幸福，不是轻易得来的，这是苏联人民在共产党的领导下，经过长期艰苦奋斗换来的。我们“三八”人民公社的全体社员一定要在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉照耀下，鼓足革命干劲，抓住生产关键，为实现1960年更大更好的跃进而奋斗。
