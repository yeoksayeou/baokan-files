Accumulated a complete set of experiences: clarifying the production policy of serving industry, agriculture, and people's livelihood; strengthening ideological education, establishing the socialist ideology of "one for the country, two for the collective, and three for oneself"; determining the direction of development, making it have a clear division of labor with state-owned industries; making reasonable regulations on working hours, wages and benefits, accumulation and distribution, and sales forms; and developing collective welfare and cultural and educational undertakings accordingly.

(This newspaper dispatch) Spurred by the great leap forward in the motherland in 1958 and the upsurge of the whole people running industry, the street-run industries in Shenyang City, which sprang up like mushrooms after a rain, have now embarked on a path of consolidation and sound development after a series of rectification work.

The street-run industries in Shenyang City were established under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line and under the specific guidance of the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee's policy of "self-reliance, self-financing, making do with whatever is available, starting from scratch, growing from small to large, and evolving from simple to complex," fully leveraging the wisdom and strength of the masses. Over the past year or more, after several mergers and reorganizations, there are currently 586 street-run factories in the city, with 1,390 production workshops and 9,258 various machines and equipment. There are a total of 82,100 production personnel, of which 84.1% are housewives. The vigorous development of street-run industries has added a powerful assistant to state-owned industries, further enriched the supply of commodities, and promoted the prosperity of the market and the development of industrial and agricultural production.

Over the past year, the street-run industry in Shenyang City, from nothing to something, from small to large, from imperfect to perfect, has developed and grown through a series of rectification and consolidation work. At the beginning of the establishment of street industries, many of the personnel participating in production were individual residents who used to be individual households, and some of them were individual laborers and small business owners. Therefore, in the minds of some people, there was a strong sense of individualism, departmentalism, and capitalism. In terms of labor attitude, they showed phenomena such as picking and choosing work, being calculative about treatment, and not observing labor discipline. In terms of business management, they believed that producing products such as "chemicals" and "electrical appliances" had a big name, and producing civilian-needed products was not glorious as "hairpin factory director" and "steaming basket workshop director"; they were willing to produce and sell themselves, but unwilling to process parts. Under the control of this kind of thinking, the phenomena of pursuing output value, seeking high profits, and even competing with state-owned enterprises for raw materials, products, and sales occurred for a time. After the Party organizations at the municipal and district levels discovered the above-mentioned problems, they adopted methods of self-education and positive education, focusing on the main problems existing in the masses' minds at various periods, and carried out socialist and communist education movements in depth, breaking down individualism and capitalism, and establishing the socialist ideology of "one for the country, two for the collective, and three for oneself," thus laying an ideological foundation for the consolidation and healthy development of street-run industries.

Determining the correct production policy and constantly adjusting the production direction is an important link in ensuring the healthy development of street-run industries. At the beginning of the establishment of street-run industries in Shenyang City, it was in the high tide of the great leap forward in state-owned industrial production. At that time, the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee put forward the "three services" production policy of street-run industries serving the needs of industry, agriculture, and people's lives, emphasizing that street-run industries should act as "assistants" and play a "supporting role" for state-owned large-scale industries, which played a great role in supporting the great leap forward of state-owned industries and developing street-run industries. However, later, due to the leap forward development of industrial and agricultural production and the rapid increase in social purchasing power, the market urgently needed a large supply of small commodities to serve the people's lives. According to the development of the objective situation and the characteristics of street-run industries, the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee re-adjusted the focus of implementing the "three services" policy, determining that street-run industries should first serve the market and the people's lives, secondly serve industry, and thirdly serve agriculture. At the same time, it was proposed that street-run industries should widely utilize waste, old, and substandard materials and leftover materials from state-owned enterprises, mainly engage in the production of "low, crude, and small" products, and implement the principle of "local sourcing, local production, and local sales." This not only pointed out a clear direction for the development of street-run industries and promoted the development of street-run industries, but also enabled street-run industries and state-owned industries to have a reasonable division of labor, making it easier for state-owned industries to concentrate their efforts on completing the production tasks of "high, precision, and large" products.

In the rectification and consolidation work, in order to fully mobilize the management enthusiasm of the collectively-owned street-run industries, reasonable regulations were made on important policy issues such as working hours, wages and benefits, accumulation and distribution, and sales forms of street-run industries. This is an important factor in promoting the healthy development of street-run industries throughout the city. In terms of working hours, considering that most of the production personnel participating in street-run industries are housewives, who have to participate in production and take care of housework, as well as their urgent desire to learn cultural and technical skills after participating in production, it was determined that the working hours of employees in street-run industries should be less than the working hours of state-owned enterprises, generally six or four hours a day. In terms of wages and benefits, based on the current situation that street industries have little accumulation, a weak foundation, and need to constantly expand reproduction, as well as the fact that the personnel participating in production have less working hours, lower technical level, and lower labor productivity than employees in state-owned enterprises, it was determined that the wage level of employees in street-run industries should be lower than the wage level of state-owned enterprises producing similar products. And according to the different circumstances of employees' work attitude, labor intensity, technical level, and production value, wages were generally adjusted successively, solving the phenomenon of large differences in wages in the early stage of establishment, and correctly implementing the principle of distribution according to work. In terms of the ratio of accumulation and distribution, it was determined that the total income of street-run industries, after deducting material consumption, wages, and taxes, 70% to 80% of the net profit should be used as the accumulation of street-run industries and the basic construction investment of collective welfare, culture, education, health, and other undertakings, and the remaining 20% to 30% should be used as collective consumption. There are three forms of production and sales in street-run industries: 1. Processing orders: street-run industries establish cooperative relations with state-owned enterprises and carry out processing with supplied materials; 2. Self-produced and guaranteed sales: self-raised raw materials and materials, and the products produced are guaranteed sales by state-owned commercial departments; 3. Self-produced and self-sold: self-raised raw materials, and the products produced are sold according to market management prices. Among them, the first two are basic, and the latter is mainly for a few sporadic products.

With the development of street-run industries, collective welfare undertakings and cultural and educational undertakings have been developed accordingly in various streets, which is another important measure that must be taken to consolidate and improve street industries. At present, according to needs and possibilities, a total of 947 nurseries and kindergartens have been established in various streets throughout the city, 204 public canteens have been established, and life service stations (points) have been widely established in various streets. 420 Red and Expert Schools have been established, and many cultural stations, libraries, amateur troupes, and singing teams have also been established, which have played a significant role in improving their political, cultural, and technical level and enlivening cultural life.

Strengthening the Party's leadership and conscientiously implementing the class line are the fundamental guarantees for the continuous consolidation and sound development of street-run industries in Shenyang City. In order to strengthen the leadership over street-run industries, the Party organizations in Shenyang City and various districts have established special institutions, forming a strong professional front, establishing and developing Party organizations in street-run industries, and establishing the Party's absolute leadership over street-run industries. At the same time, in the rectification and consolidation work, the class line of relying on street Party members, League members, retired veteran workers, family members of employees, revolutionary martyrs, family members of military personnel, and street activists was conscientiously implemented.

    从无到有　从小到大　从不完善到完善
    沈阳街道工业健步前进
    积累了一整套经验：明确生产方针，为工业、农业和人民生活服务；加强思想教育工作，树立“一为国家、二为集体、三为自己”的社会主义思想；确定发展方向，使之与国营工业有明确的分工；对劳动时间、工资待遇、积累与分配、产销形式做出合理规定；相应地发展集体福利事业和文化教育事业。
    本报讯　在1958年祖国全面大跃进和全民大办工业的高潮中，如雨后春笋般兴办起来的沈阳市街道民办工业，经过一系列的整顿工作，现在已经走上了巩固和健全发展的道路。
    沈阳市街道民办工业，是在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，在中共沈阳市委“自力更生、自筹自办、因陋就简、白手起家、由小到大、从简到繁”的方针具体指导下，充分发挥群众的智慧和力量兴办起来的。一年多来，经过几次合并、改组，目前全市共有街道民办工厂五百八十六处，有生产车间一千三百九十个，各种机器设备九千二百五十八台。共有生产人员八万二千一百多人，其中家庭妇女占84．1％。街道民办工业的蓬勃发展，为国营工业增加了有力的助手，进一步充实了商品供应，促进了市场的繁荣和工农业生产的发展。
    沈阳市街办工业，一年来从无到有，从小到大，从不完善到完善，是经过一系列的整顿巩固工作而发展壮大起来的。在街道工业兴办之初，由于参加生产的人员多是过去一家一户的个体居民，其中并有一部分是个体劳动者和小业主。因此在一些人的思想中，存在着浓厚的个人主义、本位主义和资本主义思想。在劳动态度上，表现出挑拣工作、计较待遇、不遵守劳动纪律等现象。在经营管理上，认为生产“化工”、“电器”等产品名头大，生产民需产品是当“发卡厂长”和“蒸笼车间主任”不光彩；愿自产自销，不愿加工配件。在这种思想支配下，便产生了追产值、求高利，甚至一度产生与国营企业争原料、争产品、争销售等现象。市、区各级党的组织发现上述问题后，针对着各个时期群众思想上存在的主要问题，采取自我教育和正面教育的方法，深入地开展了社会主义和共产主义教育运动，大破个人主义和资本主义，树立了“一为国家、二为集体、三为自己”的社会主义思想，从而为街办工业的巩固和健康发展奠定了思想基础。
    确定正确的生产方针和不断调整生产方向，是保证街办工业健康发展的重要一环。沈阳市街办工业兴办之初，正处在国营工业生产大跃进的高潮时期，当时中共沈阳市委提出了街办工业为工业、农业和人民生活需要服务的“三服务”的生产方针，强调了街办工业要为国营大工业作“助手”，当“配角”，对于支援国营工业的大跃进和发展街办工业都起了很大作用。但是，后来由于工农业生产的飞跃发展和社会购买力的迅速提高，市场上迫切需要大量供应为人民生活服务的小商品。中共沈阳市委又根据客观形势的发展和街办工业的特点，重新调整了贯彻“三服务”方针的重点，确定街办工业首先应该为市场和人民生活服务，其次为工业服务，再次为农业服务。同时提出街办工业应该广泛利用废、旧、次料和国营企业的边角料，主要从事“低、粗、小”的产品生产，贯彻“就地取材，就地生产，就地销售”的原则，这样既为街办工业指出了明确的发展方向，推动了街办工业的发展，又使街办工业和国营工业有了合理分工，便于国营工业集中精力去完成“高、精、大”的产品生产任务。
    在整顿巩固工作中，为了充分调动集体所有制的街办工业的经营积极性，对街办工业的劳动时间、工资待遇、积累与分配、产销形式等重要政策问题做出了合理的规定。这是推动全市街办工业健康发展的重要因素。在劳动时间方面，根据参加街办工业的生产人员多半是家庭妇女，她们既要参加生产又要料理家务，以及她们参加生产后学习文化技术的迫切愿望，确定民办工业职工的劳动时间应该少于国营企业的劳动时间，一般以每天劳动六小时或四小时为宜。在工资待遇方面，根据目前街道工业积累少、底子薄、需要不断扩大再生产，以及参加生产的人员比国营企业职工劳动时间少技术水平低，劳动生产率低等情况，确定街办工业职工的工资水平应低于同类生产的国营企业的工资水平。并且根据职工的劳动态度、劳动强度、技术水平、生产价值等不同情况，先后普遍调整了工资，解决了初办时期工资高低相差悬殊的现象，正确地贯彻了按劳付酬的原则。在积累与分配的比例方面，确定街办工业的总收入，除去物资消耗，工资和纳税外，以纯利润的70％—80％作为街办工业的积累和集体福利、文教、卫生等各项事业的基本建设投资，其余的20％—30％作为集体消费。街办工业的产销形式有三种：一、加工订货：街办工业与国营企业建立协作关系，进行带料加工；二、自产包销：自筹原料材料，生产的产品由国营商业部门包销；三、自产自销：自筹原材料，生产的产品按照市场管理价格进行销售。其中，前两种是基本的，后一种主要是少数零星的产品。
    随着街办工业的发展，各个街道相应地发展了集体福利事业和文化教育事业，这是巩固提高街道工业必须采取的另一项重要措施。目前，全市各个街道根据需要与可能，共建立托儿所和幼儿园九百四十七所，举办公共食堂二百零四处，同时在各个街道广泛建立了生活服务站（点），建立了红专学校四百二十所，还建立了许多文化站、图书馆、业余剧团和歌咏队等，对于提高她们的政治、文化、技术水平和活跃文化生活，发挥了显著作用。
    加强党的领导，认真贯彻阶级路线，是沈阳市街办工业获得不断巩固和健全发展的根本保证。为了加强对街办工业的领导，沈阳市和各区党的组织，都设立了专门的机构，形成了一条强有力的专业战线，在街道民办工业中建立和发展了党的组织，树立了党对街办工业的绝对领导。同时，在整顿巩固工作中，认真贯彻了依靠街道党、团员、退休老工人、职工家属、烈、军属和街道积极分子的阶级路线。
