Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 8th: Shanghai city, counties, and communes are mobilizing at all levels, with production departments, educational institutions, and scientific research units working closely together to accelerate the training of agricultural technical personnel.

Over the past few years, the Shanghai suburbs have cultivated a technical force of approximately four thousand people, including tractor drivers, truck drivers, mechanical and electrical irrigation and drainage technicians, and repair technicians, as well as over ten thousand workers in county-run agricultural machinery repair plants and commune-run farm implement factories. With the consolidation and development of the People's Communes and the need for technical personnel for agricultural technical transformation, the city, counties, People's Communes, and all relevant parties have further strengthened the work of training agricultural technical personnel. The Chemical Engineering Training Class organized by the Chemical Industry Research Institute is training a group of core personnel for the construction of small chemical fertilizer plants in various suburban counties. Many of the tractor drivers trained by the city-run tractor training class have become advanced producers. Recently, over one hundred factories in the city have formed one hundred and eighteen technical service teams to bring technology to the countryside in their spare time, both repairing agricultural machinery for the communes and giving on-site demonstrations to impart technical experience. Many factory workers are also linked to commune-run factories, going to the countryside regularly to provide guidance and train new recruits on the job. Some scientific research units are holding lectures such as "Introducing Pig Raising Knowledge" through radio broadcasts to help commune livestock veterinarians and feeding management personnel increase their knowledge of preventing and controlling pig diseases and protecting pregnancies and ensuring production.

In order to meet the needs of completing projects such as building mechanical and electrical irrigation canals and erecting transmission lines before the start of spring plowing, all counties in the Shanghai suburbs are using existing technical personnel as the backbone and adopting the method of masters leading apprentices to accelerate the training of personnel in this area. Pudong County mobilized forty young commune members to learn the measurement of irrigation canals, led by technicians who taught while doing, and after a week of practice, the trainees were able to master this technology. Songjiang County recently transferred over four hundred young commune members, with veteran technicians with higher technical levels as their masters, adopting the method of one master with multiple apprentices, learning and doing at the same time, to continue training a group of mechanical and electrical technicians. Recently, counties and communes in the Shanghai suburbs have also organized old farmers, production experts, local experts, teachers, workers, and scientific and technological personnel to establish science and technology societies, using county- and commune-run factories and experimental farms and fields as bases to train technical personnel. Jiading County used veteran masters from the county-run agricultural machinery factory as teachers to train 242 automatic threshing machine operators; the county also organized 143 technical workers to go deep into various communes to provide zonal contracted guidance, helping new threshing machine operators further master the operation and repair techniques of the machines.

The People's Communes in the Shanghai suburbs are further developing and consolidating and improving agricultural middle schools, adding courses such as animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, and agricultural machinery to these schools, organizing schools to link up with nearby mechanical and electrical irrigation stations and tractor stations, so that agricultural middle schools become an important base for training agricultural technical personnel.

    市县公社层层动手　有关单位密切协作
    上海郊区技术队伍迅速成长
    新华社上海8日电　上海市、县、公社层层动手，生产部门、教育机关和科学研究单位紧密协作，加速培养农业技术人材。
    上海郊区几年来已培养起一支技术队伍，包括拖拉机手、汽车司机、机电排灌技术人员、修理技工约四千多人，县办农业机械修配厂和社办农具厂的工人共有一万多人。随着人民公社的巩固、发展和农业技术改造对技术人材的需要，市、县、人民公社和各有关方面都进一步加强了培养农业技术人材的工作。化工研究院举办的化工训练班，正在为郊区各县培训一批小型化肥厂的建厂骨干。市办的拖拉机训练班，培养出来的拖拉机手已有不少成为先进生产者。最近全市又有一百多个工厂的工人，组成了一百十八个技术服务队，利用业余时间送技术下乡，一面为公社修理农业机具，一面作现场表演，传授技术经验。有不少工厂的工人还和社办工厂挂钩，定期下乡指导，跟班培养新手。有的科学研究单位通过无线电广播举办“介绍养猪知识”等讲座，帮助公社畜牧兽医、饲养管理人员增长防治猪病、保胎保产等知识。
    为了适应春耕开始前要完成的兴建机电灌溉渠道、架设输电线路等工程的需要，市郊各县都以原有的技术人员为骨干，采取师傅带徒弟的办法，加速培养这方面的人材。浦东县调集四十个青年社员学习灌溉渠道的测量，由技术员带领边做边讲，学员经过一个星期的实习，就能掌握这方面的技术。松江县最近抽调四百多个青年社员，由技术水平较高的老技工为师傅，采取一师多徒、随学随做的办法，继续培训一批机电技术人员。市郊各县、公社最近还纷纷组织老农、生产能手、土专家、教师、工人、科技人员等建立科学技术学会，以县，社办的工厂和试验场、试验田为基地，培训技术人员。嘉定县以县办农业机械厂的老师傅为教师，训练了自动脱粒机手二百四十二人；全县又组织一百四十三个技术工人深入各个公社，划片包干巡回指导，帮助新脱粒机手进一步掌握机器的操纵和修理技术。
    上海市郊区各人民公社进一步发展和巩固提高农业中学，在这些学校中增设畜牧兽医、农业机械等课程，组织学校和附近的机电灌溉站、拖拉机站挂钩，使农业中学成为培养农业技术人材的重要基地。
