Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 5th: The Secretariat of the National Council of the Communist Party of India (CPI) today issued a statement on the Kerala election, saying that the party will defend the achievements won by workers, farmers, and other working people during the period when the party and other democratic forces governed Kerala.

The statement said that the CPI, fighting alone against the Tripartite Alliance—the Congress Party, the Praja Socialist Party, and the Muslim League—which was supported by big capitalists and backed in every possible way by the powerful Catholic Church and communal reactionaries, not only maintained its position but also won new ground. "The number of votes obtained by the party and its allies increased by more than 1.2 million compared to the results of the 1957 general election."

The statement said, "Democratic forces have every reason to feel uneasy about the electoral victory of the Tripartite Alliance of the Congress Party, the Praja Socialist Party, and the Muslim League, because this victory essentially means a temporary victory for political reactionaries and communalism. However, from a broader perspective, this is only one aspect of the electoral situation, and it by no means signifies that the people's cause has been rejected by the masses of Kerala." The statement refuted a past claim by the Congress Party's top authorities that the masses had abandoned the Communist Party, which was the reason for dissolving the Communist Party-led government and central intervention. The statement said that the voting figures, as a sign of mass disaffection, show "that a shift has occurred that is more favorable to the Communist Party than to any other party. This obvious fact is now indisputable."

The statement said, "Although the democratic forces and our party are very strong in Kerala, they are not yet strong enough to defeat the alliance of all reactionary and communal forces formed to win the election. Naturally, appropriate lessons should be learned to make up for this shortcoming."

The Communist Party of India's "New Age" weekly wrote in its recent issue that in the Kerala election, the Tripartite Alliance "used all the forces of money, religion, and communalism, and used all the power and prestige of the Indian National Congress's top authorities and the central government," and that the Indian leadership organs in full control directly directed the election campaign.

According to yesterday's "The Times of India," Kerala Congress Party Chairman Shankar also admitted on the 3rd that "a large proportion of voters remain firmly supportive of the Communist Party."

Other Indian newspapers have also commented on the election results in Kerala. A recent issue of the "Link" weekly said that it is wrong to think that "the Communist Party has lost the people's trust after being in power." It said, "The Communist Party remains one of the most powerful political forces in Kerala."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 5th: The final results of the 126 seats in the Kerala State Assembly election have been announced. The election results show that the Communist Party of India and the independent candidates it supported received approximately 50% more votes than in the 1957 general election, but the number of seats actually decreased from 65 to only 29 (26 for the Communist Party and 3 for independent candidates it supported).

The distribution of the other 97 seats is as follows: 63 for the Congress Party, 20 for the Praja Socialist Party, 11 for the Muslim League, 1 for the Revolutionary Socialist Party, and 2 for other independent candidates. Since the other two independent members have announced their participation in the Congress Party, the Congress Party currently holds a majority in the Kerala Assembly with 65 seats.

The Secretariat of the Kerala State Committee of the Communist Party of India issued a statement today saying that the Communist Party of India has not only maintained its position as the largest party in Kerala but has also become stronger than before.

According to figures provided in the statement, the Communist Party of India and the independent candidates it supported received a total of more than 3.57 million votes (more than 2.97 million votes for Communist Party candidates), accounting for 44.2% of the total votes cast. In the last election, they received more than 2.3 million votes (more than 2.1 million votes for Communist Party candidates), accounting for 40.4% of the total votes cast.

The Congress Party, which won 63 seats this time, received only 2.79 million votes. The Tripartite Alliance of the Congress Party, the Praja Socialist Party, and the Muslim League, which was formed to deal with the Communist Party unanimously in this election, received a total of only more than 4.33 million votes. Although the absolute number also increased somewhat compared with the last election, the proportion of the total votes cast decreased from 55% to 52.8%.

This election was conducted in an atmosphere of anti-communist hysteria stirred up by the Congress Party and some other political parties. The Tripartite Alliance formed by the Congress Party, the Praja Socialist Party, and the Muslim League allocated the 126 seats for the election to avoid mutual competition and the dispersion of votes. According to the election law, a constituency can generally elect only one member (some constituencies voted to elect two members this time).

On February 1, the day of the vote, 2,100 police officers were on duty at all polling stations. An incident occurred at a polling station where a Communist Party member who went to vote was stabbed to death. Conflicts occurred during the election campaign in the days before the vote, and people who supported the Communist Party of India were killed and beaten.

### 印共就喀拉拉邦选举结果发表声明  人心背向表明印共影响扩大  印共在选举中得票增加议席反而减少

    印共就喀拉拉邦选举结果发表声明
    人心背向表明印共影响扩大
    印共在选举中得票增加议席反而减少
    新华社新德里5日电　印度共产党全国委员会书记处今天就喀拉拉邦选举发表声明说，党将保卫工人、农民和其他劳动人民在党同其他民主力量在喀拉拉邦执政时期所争取到的成果。
    声明说，印度共产党同得到大资本家撑腰的、和有势力的天主教会和教族反动派千方百计的支持的三党联盟——国大党、人民社会党和穆斯林联盟——单独作战，不但保持了它的地位，而且还赢得了新的阵地。“党和它的同盟者所得的票数比1957年大选的结果增加了一百二十多万票。”
    声明说，“民主力量有一切理由由于国大党、人民社会党和穆斯林联盟的三党联盟的选举胜利而感到不安，因为这个胜利基本上意味着政治反动派和教族主义的暂时的胜利。但是，从更广泛的角度来看，这只是选举形势中的一个方面，而且这决不意味着人民的事业遭到了喀拉拉邦群众的拒绝。”声明反驳了国大党最高当局过去的一种说法，即群众已经离开了共产党，而这就是解散共产党领导的政府和中央进行干涉的理由。声明说，作为群众背向的一种标志的投票数字表明，“情况发生了对共产党比其他任何党派更为有利的转变。这个明显的事实现在是不容争辩的了。”
    声明说，“虽然民主力量和我党在喀拉拉邦很强大，但是，它们还并不强大得足以战胜所有的反动和教族力量为了赢取选举胜利而组成的联盟。自然应当吸取适当的教训来弥补这种缺陷。”
    印度共产党的“新世纪”周报在最近一期中写道，在喀拉拉邦选举中，三党联盟“利用了金钱、宗教和教族主义的一切势力，利用了印度国大党最高当局和中央政府的一切权力和声势”，而且，握有完全控制权的印度领导机关直接指挥了这次竞选运动。
    据昨日的“印度时报”报道，喀拉拉邦国大党主席山卡尔3日也承认，“有很大一部分选民仍然坚定地支持共产党”。
    印度其他报刊也纷纷评论喀拉拉邦的选举结果。最近一期的“联系”周刊说，如果认为“共产党在执政以后失去人民的信任”，那是错误的。它说，“共产党仍然是喀拉拉邦的一个最强大的政治力量。”
    新华社新德里5日电　印度喀拉拉邦议会选举的一百二十六个席位的最后结果已经揭晓。选举结果表明，印度共产党和它所支持的无党派人士得票比1957年大选时增长了约50％以上，但是席位反而从六十五席减少到只有二十九席（共产党二十六席，它支持的无党派人士三席）。
    其他九十七席的分配如下：国大党六十三席、人民社会党二十席、穆斯林联盟十一席、革命社会党一席、其他的无党派人士两席。由于其他两名无党派议员已宣布参加国大党，目前国大党已经以六十五席在喀拉拉邦议会中占居多数。
    印度共产党喀拉拉邦委员会书记处今天发表声明说，印度共产党不仅保持了喀拉拉邦第一大党的地位，而且比以前更壮大了。
    根据这项声明提供的数字，印度共产党和它所支持的无党派人士这次共得票三百五十七万多张（共产党候选人得二百九十七万多张），占整个投票总数的44．2％，而上次选举中得票二百三十多万张（共产党候选人得票二百一十万多张），占投票总数40．4％。
    这次得到六十三席的国大党得票只有二百七十九万张。这次在选举中为一致对付共产党而结成的国大党、人民社会党和穆斯林联盟三党联盟，一共只得了四百三十三万多张票，绝对数比上次虽也增加了一些，占投票总数的比例却从55％下降到52．8％。
    这次选举是在国大党和其他一些政党掀起的反共歇斯底里的气氛下进行的。国大党、人民社会党和穆斯林联盟结成的三党联盟，对竞选的一百二十六个席位作了分配，以避免互相竞争，选票分散。按照选举法，一个选区一般情况下只能选出一名议员（这次有的选区投票选出两名议员）。
    在2月1日投票那天，有二千一百名警察在所有投票站值勤。在投票站曾经发生去投票的共产党员被人用刀刺死的事件。投票前几天的竞选运动中曾经发生冲突，支持印度共产党的人曾遭杀害和殴伤。
