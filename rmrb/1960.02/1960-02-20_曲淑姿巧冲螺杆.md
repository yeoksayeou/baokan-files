Xinhua News Agency, Jinan - Since returning to her post after attending the National Conference of Heroes, Qu Shuzi, a young female lathe operator from Jinan No. 2 Machine Tool Factory, has been working with increasing vigor and skill in production. She has successively promoted six advanced experiences and improved seven tools and operating methods. In particular, she recently successfully manufactured an automatic screw rod stamping machine that can increase work efficiency by 474 times, increase raw material utilization from the original 40% to 100%, and save a large amount of cutting tools and oil.

This automated screw rod stamping machine was made with the enthusiastic support and assistance of the factory's Party Committee Secretary, veteran workers, and technicians, after more than forty experiments. Therefore, when this machine was unveiled, and when others praised her for "having ambition regardless of age, and being able to create if she dares to think," Qu Shuzi said very modestly, "Without the leadership of the Party and the help of the master workers, I could not have accomplished anything. In the future, I must work a hundred times harder to repay the Party's concern and the comrades' help."

Qu Shuzi is a well-known, clever and skillful young woman, and also a pioneering innovator with great ambition. In 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, she completed three years, nine months, and eight days' worth of work; in 1959, she completed four years, one month, and eleven days' worth of work. However, she is not satisfied with her existing achievements. The ambition she set after attending the National Conference of Heroes is to completely automate the screw processing sequence in the standard parts workshop she works in by 1960. The birth of that automatic screw rod stamping machine is only the first step in realizing her ambition.

    曲淑姿巧冲螺杆
    新华社济南电　济南第二机床厂的青年女车工曲淑姿出席全国群英会返回工作岗位之后，在生产上越干越猛，越干越巧。她连续推广了六种先进经验，改进了七种工具和操作方法，特别是最近，她又制造成功了一台自动冲螺杆机，能提高工作效率四百七十四倍，使原料利用率由原来的百分之四十提高到百分之百，还节约了大量的刀具和油料。
    这台自动化的冲螺杆机器，是在工厂党委书记、老工人和技术人员的热情支持帮助下，经过四十多次的试验而制成的。因此，当这台机器问世的时候，当别人夸奖她“有志不在年高，敢想就能创造”的时候，曲淑姿很谦虚地说：“没有党的领导和老师傅们的帮助，我什么也作不成。今后我更要加百倍的努力，回答党的关怀和同志们的帮助。”
    曲淑姿是一个有名的心灵手巧的青年姑娘，也是一个有雄心大志的革新闯将。一九五八年在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，她完成了三年九个月零八天的工作量；一九五九年又完成了四年一个月零十一天的工作量。但是，她并不满足已有的成绩。她出席全国群英会之后立下的雄心是，一定要在一九六○年把她所在的标准件工段的螺丝加工工序，全部改为自动化，那台自动冲螺杆机的诞生，只是她实现雄心的第一步。
