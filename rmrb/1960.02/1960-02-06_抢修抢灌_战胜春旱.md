    (Our Newspaper's News) The people of Weinan County, Shaanxi, are fiercely attacking the winter drought. In more than half a month of hard work, they are simultaneously making a concentrated effort to complete 320 water conservancy projects, rushing repairs and irrigation, and making every effort to minimize the area of dry land that cannot be irrigated. All of the county's 1.12 million mu of wheat fields have now received timely irrigation or hoeing and harrowing to preserve moisture. As of January 20, a total of 790,000 mu of wheat fields have been irrigated, of which 150,000 mu have been irrigated two to three times; 164,000 mu have been irrigated by carrying water, carrying ice, and sweeping snow; and the remaining 100,000 mu of sloping land have all undergone one to two winter hoeings, winter harrows, and compaction to preserve moisture.
    The current situation in the rural areas of Weinan County is very good. Since the beginning of winter, although the drought has continued, the enthusiasm and determination of the people of the county to fight drought have become even higher and more steadfast. The labor force for rushing repairs and irrigation and preserving moisture has increased from 120,000 people at the beginning to 250,000 people, accounting for 80% of the total labor force. The daily progress of winter irrigation has reached 30,000 mu, doubling the original rate.
    All 320 large, medium, and small water conservancy projects in the county are undergoing rush repairs and irrigation. Many areas have promoted the advanced experience gained in the drought resistance and autumn preservation last year, such as combining channels and wells, combining wells, and extending channels for remote irrigation, to accelerate the progress of irrigation. All of the 1,600 new, renovated, and existing channels, 17,000 water wells, 16,000 waterwheels, 80 power-driven pumping stations, and 200 reservoirs, ponds, and water storage pits have been put into winter irrigation.
    In this struggle to vigorously carry out winter irrigation and preserve moisture, all levels of Party committee secretaries, county heads, commune leaders, and more than 500 cadres have gone deep into the fields, canal sides, and well sides to work and live with the commune members. Initially, a few people did not fully recognize the severity of the drought and mistakenly believed that "spring irrigation is not as good as winter irrigation, and winter irrigation reduces production by half." Leading cadres, on the one hand, patiently explained the benefits of winter irrigation for crop growth, and on the other hand, worked with technicians to teach the masses winter irrigation techniques to improve the quality of irrigation. Some people in Huazhou Commune originally had the common idea that "if there is drought in the nine provinces, Huazhou will still have a good harvest." The commune then held an on-site meeting to "dig the soil to see the moisture and go to the fields to see the seedlings." These commune members personally saw that the winter-irrigated wheat fields had deep roots, green leaves, and strong seedlings, while the unirrigated wheat fields had shallow roots, yellow leaves, and weak growth. This dispelled the old idea that Huazhou did not need winter irrigation, and they also actively participated in winter irrigation.
    At present, the people of the county, under the oath of "the drought will not be eliminated, and the battle will not stop," have decided to expand irrigation by another 500,000 mu in summer crops and leisure land in the next few days, minimizing the proportion of dry land that cannot be irrigated to ensure that the plan to increase the average yield of wheat to 325 jin per mu will be exceeded this summer.
    (Our Newspaper's News) Haiyuan County, Ningxia, with drought prevention and resistance as the center of spring ploughing preparation work, has made great achievements after months of hard work and is now advancing victoriously.
    In late December 1959, the Haiyuan County Party Committee issued a call to the people of the county to "eliminate spring drought in winter." Combined with the socialist education movement, it organized the masses to conscientiously study the proposal for continuous red years put forward by the five counties in the Guyuan Special Zone to the entire region, so that the commune members ideologically recognized the importance of "a large increase in production with rain, and a bumper harvest without rain." All water conservancy construction sites resolutely implemented the principle of combining large, medium, and small-scale projects. In the construction process, they vigorously launched a high-efficiency movement centered on tool reform, which greatly accelerated the construction speed. Under the principle of "repairing while irrigating," they have completed winter irrigation of more than 37,000 mu.
    While grasping large and medium-sized water conservancy projects, a mass movement for small-scale water conservancy construction is also rapidly progressing. At present, 17 small-scale water conservancy projects have started in six communes throughout the county, with nearly 9,000 laborers invested. Commune members have persisted in fighting in the severe cold climate where water drips into ice, striving to expand the irrigated area by 15,000 mu before spring sowing. In the spirit of "irrigating as much as possible, even if it's just one mu, and watering as much as possible, even if it's just one point," they persist in winter irrigation by breaking ice and preserving moisture by carrying ice.
    The county has also conducted a comprehensive and detailed survey of soil moisture conditions. Judging from the current soil moisture conditions: land that can sprout accounts for 73.6% of the total cultivated land area; land that may sprout half the seedlings accounts for 19.2%; and land with poor moisture that cannot sprout accounts for 7.2%. According to the soil moisture conditions, the county is grasping effective drought prevention and resistance measures such as rolling the land and has launched a mass movement to roll the land. Now, more than 278,000 mu of land has been rolled, some of which have been rolled twice. While building water conservancy projects and rolling the land, work such as accumulating fertilizer, transporting fertilizer, preparing agricultural tools, and preparing seeds is also progressing rapidly.
    (Our Newspaper's News) In order to do a good job in the first spring sowing of the 1960s and achieve a bumper harvest without rain, the members of the Shangduoba Production Team of Qunke Commune in Hualong Hui Autonomous County, Qinghai, in the spirit of racing against time, were busy sowing during the Spring Festival, seizing the moisture.
    The Shangduoba Production Team is located along the Yellow River, with a warmer climate and earlier thawing of the land. Based on the lack of rain and snow and the drought of the land since last winter, the commune members started sowing twenty days earlier than last year. On the afternoon of the first day of the Lunar New Year, the sun was warm, and the land had thawed. All ninety-odd members of the team, with festive joy, formed specialized groups for plowing, fertilizing, hand-spreading seeds, and harrowing the land, and implemented a method of fixing personnel, draft animals, and agricultural tools. One link was closely linked to the next, and they went all out to seize the moisture to sow the seeds. In one afternoon, they planted 20 mu.
    During sowing, great importance was attached to improving the quality of sowing. The team's land was plowed, the winter-irrigated land was harrowed and leveled, 35,000 jin of base fertilizer was applied per mu, and the seeds were selected and disinfected. On this basis, the sowing was also done to ensure even fertilizer spreading; rational close planting was implemented; and the corners and edges of the land were all sown, leaving no blank spaces. After sowing, the land was carefully harrowed and pulverized, thus ensuring a great improvement in the quality of sowing.

    抢修抢灌  战胜春旱
    陕西渭南合井并流长渠远浇全部麦田适时灌溉
    宁夏海原兴修水利碾地保墒狠抓防旱备耕工作
    青海上哆吧生产队趁墒抢种保证无雨种足种好
    本报讯　陕西渭南县全民猛攻冬旱，他们在半个多月奋战中，一面突击三百二十处水利尾工，抢修抢灌，一面用尽心计将不能灌溉的旱地压缩到最低限度。全县一百一十二万多亩麦田，现已全部得到了适时灌浇或锄耙保墒。截至元月20日，实灌麦田共七十九万多亩，其中十五万亩灌了二至三水；担水、背冰和扫雪灌田的十六万四千亩，其余十多万亩沟坡地，全部进行了一至二次冬锄、冬耙和镇压保墒。
    当前渭南县农村形势很好。入冬以来，虽然旱象持续，全县人民抗旱斗争的情绪更为高昂和坚定。抢修抢灌、抗旱保墒的劳力，由初期十二万人，增长至二十五万人，占总劳力的80％。冬灌的日进度达到三万亩，较原来翻了一番。
    全县三百二十处大中小水利工程，都在抢修抢灌。不少地区推广了去年抗旱保秋中取得的渠井并流、合井并流、长渠远浇等先进经验，加快灌溉进度。今冬新修、整修和原有的一千六百多条渠道、一万七千多眼水井、一万六千多辆水车、八十多处动力抽水机站和二百多处水库、塘堰、涝池等所有水利设施，全部投入冬灌。
    在这场大闹冬灌、抗旱保墒的斗争中，全县各级党委书记、县长、公社领导同志和五百多名干部，都深入田间、渠边、井边，同社员群众一道劳动和生活。最初少数人对旱象严重性认识不足，错误认为“春灌冬不灌，冬灌产量减一半”。领导干部一方面耐心讲清冬灌对庄稼生长的好处，另外会同技术人员向群众传授冬灌技术，提高灌溉质量。华州公社部分群众原先较普遍存在着“旱了九州，收了华州”的思想，公社便举办“挖土看墒、下地看苗”的现场会议。这些社员亲眼看到了冬灌过的麦田，根深叶绿麦苗旺，未灌的麦田根浅叶黄生长弱，破除了华州不需冬灌的老观念，也纷纷积极投入了冬灌。
    目前，全县人民在“旱象不灭，战斗不歇”的誓言下，确定最近几天在夏田作物和休闲地中，再扩灌五十万亩，将真正不能灌溉的旱地压缩到最小比例，以保证小麦平均亩产三百二十五斤的增产计划今夏超额完成。
    本报讯　宁夏海原县以防旱抗旱为中心的春耕准备工作，经过数月的奋战，已取得很大成绩，目前正在乘胜前进。
    中共海原县委在1959年12月下旬就向全县人民发出了“把春旱消灭在冬天”的号召，结合社会主义教育运动，组织群众认真地学习了固原专区五县向全区提出的连年红倡议书，使社员们从思想上认识了“有雨大增产，无雨也丰收”的重要意义。各个水利工地，坚决贯彻执行了大、中、小型相结合的方针，在施工过程中大搞以工具改革为中心的高工效运动，大大加快了施工速度。在“边修边灌”的原则下，已完成冬灌面积三万七千多亩。
    在抓大中型水利工程的同时，一个群众性的小型水利建设运动也在迅速进展着。目前全县已有六个公社十七处小型水利工程开工，投入劳力近九千多人。社员们在滴水成冰的严寒气候下，坚持战斗，为力争春播前扩大一万五千亩灌溉面积而奋斗。他们本着“能多浇一亩是一亩，能多灌一分是一分”的精神，坚持打冰冬灌，背冰保墒。
    全县对地墒情况也进行了全面、详细的摸底排队。从当前的地墒情况看：能出苗的占全部耕地面积的73．6％；可能出半苗的占19．2％；墒气不好，不能出苗的占7．2％。根据地墒情况，全县抓紧打碾土地等行之有效的防旱抗旱措施，展开了一个群众性的打碾土地运动，现在已打碾土地二十七万八千多亩，其中有一部分还打碾了两遍。在兴修水利、打碾土地的同时，积肥、运肥、农具准备、种子准备等工作也在迅速进行。
    本报讯　为了搞好六十年代第一个春播，实现无雨保丰收，青海化隆回族自治县群科公社上哆吧生产队社员，本着争分夺秒精神，春节期间，抢墒播种忙。
    上哆吧生产队位于黄河沿岸，气候较暖，土地解冻早。社员们从去冬以来雨雪缺少、土地干旱的情况出发，比去年提早播种期二十天。农历正月初一日的下午，阳光和煦，土地消冻了，全队九十多个社员，一个个怀着节日的欢乐，组成犁地、撒肥、手溜种、耱地等专业小组，实行定人员、定耕畜、定农具的办法，一环紧扣一环，鼓足干劲，抢墒下种，一个下午就种上了二十亩。
    播种中，对提高播种质量很重视。全队土地进行了耕翻，浇了冬水的地进行了打耱平整，每亩地送了基肥三万五千斤，种子经过了拣选和消毒。在这个基础上，播种又做到了撒肥均匀；实行合理密植；地角地边都播到，不留一点空白；种后细致耙耱、打碎了坷垃，因而保证了播种质量的大大提高。
