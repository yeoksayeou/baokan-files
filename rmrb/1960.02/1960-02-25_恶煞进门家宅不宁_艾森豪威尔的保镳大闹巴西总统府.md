Xinhua News Agency, Rio de Janeiro, February 24th: The measures taken by the American secret police to protect Eisenhower, which undermined Brazilian sovereignty, caused a dispute between the representative of the American secret police and General Nelson de Mello, the Chief of Staff of the Brazilian Presidential Palace. This incident was revealed by three newspapers, "Brazilian Daily," "Daily Evening News," and "Forum Newspaper," on February 18th.

    The incident occurred inside the Presidential Palace. The head of the American secret police demanded that personnel inside the Presidential Palace be evacuated for inspection and requested that his staff be allowed to stay in the Presidential Palace during Eisenhower's visit.

    General Nelson de Mello, Chief of Staff of the Presidential Palace, rejected this request and explained that during Eisenhower's stay at the Presidential Palace, he would be protected by Brazilian government personnel.

    In the city of Sao Paulo, where Eisenhower was scheduled to stay for a few hours, the American secret police also inspected the governor's office building and forced the state government personnel to evacuate the building, forcing the governor to move.

    According to a report in the "News Daily" on the 23rd, the American secret police also inspected various parts of the House of Representatives in Rio de Janeiro on the 22nd and took pictures of the places Eisenhower would pass through. On the 22nd, two Social Democratic Party members, Osmar and Elias, protested against two American policemen wearing short-sleeved shirts and no ties being present at a meeting in the House of Representatives. These congressmen said, "Since Brazilians must wear a jacket and tie when entering the House of Representatives, so should foreigners." Later, the American policemen withdrew.

    Commenting on the incident of American police inspecting the House of Representatives, the "News Daily" said: "The approach taken by the security personnel responsible for President Eisenhower is irritating."

    "The Last Hour Report" wrote on the 23rd that the people of Rio de Janeiro were puzzled by the extraordinary security measures taken for Eisenhower. The newspaper pointed out that the appearance of American police in the House of Representatives was an insult to Brazilians. The newspaper continued, "Eisenhower does not need this kind of security measure used to prevent the people from personally killing criminals." The newspaper said that for more than two months, four hundred American secret police officers had taken security measures in Rio de Janeiro, and "the extraordinary security measures taken for Eisenhower make us feel very uneasy."

    恶煞进门家宅不宁
    艾森豪威尔的保镳大闹巴西总统府
    新华社24日讯　里约热内卢消息：美国秘密警察为保护艾森豪威尔而采取的有损巴西主权的措施，引起了美国秘密警察的代表同巴西总统府侍卫长纳尔逊·德梅洛将军之间的一场纠纷。这个事件是由“巴西日报”、“每日晚报”、“论坛报”等三家报纸在2月18日透露的。
    事件是在总统府内发生的。美国秘密警察的首脑要求总统府内的人员撤离总统府，以便进行巡视，同时要求让他手下的人员在艾森豪威尔访问这里的期间呆在总统府。
    总统府侍卫长纳尔逊·德梅洛将军拒绝了这种要求，并解释说：艾森豪威尔住在总统府期间，将由巴西政府人员来保护他。
    在艾森豪威尔预定要逗留几小时的圣保罗市，美国秘密警察也曾到州长办公大楼去巡视，并强使州政府的人员撤离办公大楼，州长不得不搬家。
    据“新闻日报”23日报道：美国秘密警察22日还到里约热内卢众议院的各个地方进行巡视，并对艾森豪威尔将要经过的地方拍摄了照片。22日，社会民主党的两位议员奥斯马尔和埃利亚斯抗议两个穿短袖衬衫不戴领带的美国警察在众议院开会时呆在那里。这些议员们说：“既然巴西人进入众议院时必须穿上衣和戴领带，那么外国人也就应该这样。”后来美国警察就撤走了。
    “新闻日报”在谈到美国警察到众议院来巡视的事件时说：“负责艾森豪威尔总统的保安人员的那种做法令人恼火。”
      “最后一点钟报”23日写道，里约热内卢的人民对于为艾森豪威尔采取的这种异乎寻常的保安措施感到不解。报纸指出，美国警察在众议院的出现是对巴西人的侮辱。报纸接着说：“艾森豪威尔是无需这种用来防止人民亲自动手打死罪犯的保安措施的。”报纸说，两个多月以来，在里约热内卢有四百名美国秘密警察采取保安措施，“为艾森豪威尔采取的这种异乎寻常的保安措施，使我们感到十分不安”。
