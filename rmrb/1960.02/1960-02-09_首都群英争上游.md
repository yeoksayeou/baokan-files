Xinhua News Agency report: The advanced collectives and advanced producers from Beijing who attended the National Conference of Heroes are displaying the heroic spirit of always striving upwards and have recently created many outstanding new achievements.

	Constantly Climbing Peaks
	The workers of the eight-cubic-meter small blast furnace at the Xuanwu Iron and Steel Plant, who completed last year's state plan 110 days ahead of schedule, creatively applied the advanced experiences learned from various regions at the Conference of Heroes. They carried out five technical transformations on the small blast furnace. In early January of this year, the average utilization coefficient of the small blast furnace reached 3.65, an increase of 1.32 compared to before the Conference of Heroes (early October last year). Since the Conference of Heroes, the loading and unloading team of the Guanghua Lumber Mill has continued to carry out technical innovations based on the previous semi-mechanization. The number of people unloading each railway car of timber has been reduced from 10 to 12 to 8, and the unloading time has been shortened from 67 minutes before the Conference of Heroes to 28 minutes, reaching the national advanced speed.

	Innovation After Innovation
	The "Dual Transformation" commando team of the painting section of the stamping workshop at the Beijing Automobile Factory is advancing towards automation after achieving mechanization of electroplating and painting. The team members spent only 22 days to successfully trial-produce a semi-automatic assembly line for painting automobile headlights, increasing the daily output of headlight painting from more than 500 before the Conference of Heroes to 2,000, increasing efficiency by three times and reducing manpower by half. After returning from the Conference of Heroes, Hu Sibei, a young machinist from the door and window workshop of the Beijing Guanghua Lumber Mill, under the leadership of the Party branch, formed a Communist cooperation team with technicians and workers. After 74 experiments, they successfully developed a window sash combined machine, which increased production efficiency by nine times and saved half the manpower.

	Enthusiastically Helping Others
	Ni Zhifu, a fitter at the Yongding Machinery Factory, disseminated his advanced experience through training classes and performances at fraternal factories. Currently, the "Ni Zhifu Drill" has blossomed and borne fruit throughout the city, with more than 6,700 fitters learning this advanced experience. Liu Guangjin, a boiler worker at the Shijingshan Power Plant who created a set of advanced boiler operation experiences such as burning low-quality coal, actively helped new boilers to trial-burn low-quality coal. Currently, all boilers in the plant generally burn low-quality coal, and some new boilers use only low-quality coal for power generation.

    首都群英争上游
    据新华社讯　北京市出席全国群英会的先进集体和先进生产者发扬永远向上的英雄本色，最近又创造了许多突出的新成绩。
    不断攀高峰
    提前一百一十天完成去年国家计划的宣武钢铁厂八立方米小高炉职工，创造性地运用群英会上学到的各地先进经验，对小高炉进行了五项技术改造，今年一月上旬小高炉平均利用系数达到了三点六五，比群英会前（去年十月上旬）提高了一点三二。光华木材厂搬运、装卸队从群英会以后，在以前土机械化的基础上继续大搞技术革新，每卸一车皮木材的人数从十到十二人减到八人，卸车时间从群英会前的六十七分钟缩短到二十八分，达到全国先进速度。
    革新再革新
    北京汽车制造厂冲压车间镀漆工段“双化”突击队，在实现了电镀、喷漆的机械化以后，又向自动化进军。队员们仅用二十二天的时间就试制成功汽车大灯喷漆半自动化流水线，使大灯喷漆日产从群英会以前的五百多个提高到两千个，效率提高了三倍，人员减少了一半。北京市光华木材厂门窗车间青年机工胡四辈从群英会归来后，在党支部领导下和技术人员、工人一起组成了一支共产主义协作队，经过七十四次试验研究成功了窗扇联合机，提高生产效率九倍，人力节省一半。
    热心帮别人
    永定机械厂钳工倪志福通过训练班和到兄弟厂表演等方式传播自己的先进经验，目前“倪志福钻头”已经在全市普遍开花结果，有六千七百多名钳工学会了这项先进经验。创造了烧低质煤等一套锅炉操作先进经验的石景山发电厂锅炉工人刘光金，积极帮助新锅炉试烧低质煤，目前全厂锅炉都普遍烧用低质煤，有的新锅炉全部用低质煤发电。
