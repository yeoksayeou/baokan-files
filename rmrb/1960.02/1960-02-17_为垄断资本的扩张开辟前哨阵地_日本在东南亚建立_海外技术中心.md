    Opening a Forward Position for the Expansion of Monopoly Capital:
    Japan Establishes "Overseas Technical Centers" in Southeast Asia
    (Reported by this newspaper) According to Japan Broadcasting Association radio, the Kishi Nobusuke government will begin establishing a series of "Overseas Technical Centers" in various parts of Southeast Asia starting this year. These so-called "Overseas Technical Centers" will be equipped with agricultural, industrial, and fisheries technicians and machinery to "guide" the technical work of Southeast Asian countries.
    The issue of establishing "Overseas Technical Centers" was raised when Kishi Nobusuke visited Southeast Asia in 1957 to peddle his "Southeast Asia Development Plan." Since then, the Kishi Nobusuke government has drafted a plan to establish fifteen "Overseas Technical Centers" in various parts of Southeast Asia. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is responsible for managing these "Technical Centers." The establishment of these "Technical Centers" will open a forward position and technical intelligence points for the expansion of Japanese monopoly capital. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs says that these "Overseas Technical Centers" can provide "technical guidance" to local people, help "develop industries," and play a significant role in Japan's "economic cooperation" with Southeast Asia.
    Japan is prepared to establish a communications center in the suburbs of Bangkok, Thailand, around June, an agricultural center near Dhaka, East Pakistan, a fisheries center in Ceylon in July, and a small and medium-sized enterprise technology center in West Bengal, India, in October.

    为垄断资本的扩张开辟前哨阵地
    日本在东南亚建立“海外技术中心”
    本报讯　据日本广播协会电台报道，岸信介政府从今年开始在东南亚各地建立一批“海外技术中心”。这些所谓“海外技术中心”将配备农业、工业、渔业的技术人员和机械，以“指导”东南亚各国的技术工作。
    建立“海外技术中心”的问题，是1957年岸信介访问东南亚兜售他的“东南亚开发计划”时提出来的。从那以后，岸信介政府便拟定了一个在东南亚各地建立十五个“海外技术中心”的计划。负责管理这些“技术中心”的是日本外务省。这些“技术中心”的建立将为日本垄断资本的扩张开辟前哨阵地和技术情报点。日本外务省说，这些“海外技术中心”，可以对当地人进行“技术指导”，帮助“开发产业”，对于日本同东南亚的“经济合作”会起巨大作用。
    日本已准备在今年6月前后在泰国曼谷郊外建立通讯中心，在东巴基斯坦的达卡附近建立农业中心，7月间在锡兰建立渔业中心，10月间在印度西孟加拉邦建立中小企业技术中心。
