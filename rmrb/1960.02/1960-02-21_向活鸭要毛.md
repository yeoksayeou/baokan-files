Asking for Feathers from Live Ducks

"Asking for feathers from live ducks and geese" is a slogan recently put forward by the livestock product purchasing departments. According to China's past habits, duck feathers could only be obtained by killing the duck. This method limited the source of feathers to a certain extent. In order to expand the source of feathers, the livestock product purchasing departments learned from Hungary's advanced experience—plucking feathers from live ducks and geese.

The experience of plucking live ducks and geese has been promoted in Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, and other places. According to the experience of Gaoyou County, Jiangsu Province, a goose that has been plucked gains 600 grams in weight after ten days, while a goose that has not been plucked gains only 500 grams. Ducks that have been plucked grow new feathers in three or four days and return to their original state in two months, after which they can be plucked a second time.

    向活鸭要毛
    “向活鸭活鹅要毛”是畜产品收购部门最近提出来的口号。按照我国过去的习惯，要鸭毛只有杀了鸭才能得到毛。这种方法使羽毛的来源受到了一定限制。为了扩大羽毛的来源，畜产品收购部门学习了匈牙利的先进经验——在活鸭活鹅身上拔毛。
    活鸭鹅拔毛的经验已在北京、上海、江苏、安徽、浙江等地推广。据江苏省高邮县的经验，一只拔过毛的鹅，十天后体重增加一斤四两，未拔毛的鹅体重仅增加十两。拔过毛的鸭子，三、四天以后就长新羽毛，两个月恢复原状，以后还可以拔第二次。
