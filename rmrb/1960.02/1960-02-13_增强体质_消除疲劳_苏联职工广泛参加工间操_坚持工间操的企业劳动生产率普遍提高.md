    Strengthen Physical Fitness, Eliminate Fatigue
    Soviet Workers Widely Participate in Workplace Exercises
    Labor Productivity Universally Increases in Enterprises That Persist in Workplace Exercises
    Xinhua News Agency Report: Workplace exercises are being carried out more and more widely in the Soviet Union. Currently, more than five million workers throughout the Soviet Union regularly participate in workplace exercises, a significant increase compared to 1958.
    The promotion of workplace exercises shows that continuously engaging in them is one of the effective and simple ways to eliminate fatigue, strengthen physical fitness, and improve labor productivity. According to statistical materials from the Leningrad Institute of Labor Organization, Economics, and Protection, labor productivity has increased by 3% to 14% in many enterprises that consistently conduct workplace exercises, and the incidence of illness has also decreased.
    The Party, Youth League, administrative, and trade union organizations of enterprises pay close attention to promoting workplace exercises, training a large number of activists to be workplace exercise instructors. A year ago, there were only more than 1,900 instructors in Kharkov enterprises; now, that number has increased to more than 3,000. One of the regions with a larger increase in the number of participants in workplace exercises is the Tatar Autonomous Republic. In 1958, the number of participants in workplace exercises was 65,000; by 1959, it had increased to 90,000.

    增强体质　消除疲劳
    苏联职工广泛参加工间操
    坚持工间操的企业劳动生产率普遍提高
    新华社讯　工间操正在苏联越来越广泛地开展起来，目前全苏联已经有五百多万职工经常参加工间操，这个数字比1958年大为增加。
    推广工间操的结果表明，不间断地从事工间操是消除疲劳、增强体质和提高劳动生产率的有效而简易的方法之一。根据列宁格勒劳动组织、经济、保护研究所的统计材料，在许多坚持不断进行工间操的企业中劳动生产率都提高了3％到14％，患病率也有减低。
    企业的党、团、行政和工会组织十分注意推广工间操，训练了大批积极分子作工间操的教练，一年前哈尔科夫企业中只有一千九百多个教练员，现在已增加到三千多人。参加工间操人数增加得较多的地区之一是鞑靼自治共和国，1958年参加工间操的人数为六万五千人，到1959年已增加到了九万人。
