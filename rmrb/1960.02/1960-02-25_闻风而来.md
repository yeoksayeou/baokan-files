Coming at the Sound of the Wind
　　Jing Yu
　　The Xuanwu District of Beijing is vigorously carrying out technical innovations in loading and unloading mechanization and semi-mechanization. In just twenty days, it fundamentally eliminated the heavy manual labor of thousands of years in the loading and unloading work of Guang'anmen and Xibianmen stations and warehouses. Those who participated in the innovation struggle, from the perspective of their occupations, included workers, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, as well as teachers, students, and neighborhood residents; from the perspective of their relationships, there were those who were interconnected in their work, and those who had no direct relationship in their work; from the perspective of regions, there were those from the district, those not from the district, and even those who came from Tangshan, hundreds of miles away, at the sound of the wind. The momentum was huge and a magnificent spectacle.

　　A local revolution, with people coming from all directions at the sound of the wind to provide full support, is an old story from the revolutionary war period. Anyone who has experienced the successive domestic revolutionary wars and the Anti-Japanese National Liberation Struggle can cite countless vivid examples, narrating how the revolutionary masses in those years were enthusiastic and high-spirited, participating in the revolution, and how they were wholeheartedly loyal, providing food and drink to support the front lines. Today, this mass revolutionary storm has reappeared on the production and construction front. Time cannot flow backward, but the fine traditions of the revolution are eternal. In the technical revolution, a great atmosphere of collaboration prevails, with people from all walks of life, related and unrelated, local and from other places, coming at the sound of the wind of collaboration. It is not any material incentive that attracts these people, but the magnificent picture of socialist construction and the great political ideals that attract them. Precisely because of this, they have a selfless spirit and a noble communist style. This noble, selfless communist style is much higher than the general style of working without regard to remuneration.

　　Revolution has always been a mass movement. Historical experience is like this, and the existing experience of technical revolution and technical innovation is also like this. The biggest root of poverty in our country during the democratic revolution was the three mountains weighing on the people's heads—imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. This root of poverty was completely eradicated with the victory of the democratic revolution. History has entered the period of socialist construction, and our biggest root of poverty is economic backwardness and cultural backwardness, and one of the most prominent manifestations of economic backwardness is the large proportion of heavy manual labor. To eradicate this root of poverty cannot be achieved in a gentle way, it requires several storms. The mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, which is sweeping the country like a storm, is such a great storm. The reason why the technical innovation of loading and unloading mechanization and semi-mechanization in the two stations of Xuanwu District, Beijing, could be quickly realized in twenty days is ultimately and decisively due to the revolutionary action of the masses.

　　On the transportation front, loading and unloading work is still the most prominent weak link at present. If it cannot be unloaded, it cannot be loaded; if it cannot be loaded, it cannot move. The final situation is: the docks are blocked, and transport vehicles are "running in the middle and stuck at both ends," while the units needing goods are stopping work and waiting for materials. Of course, in times of severe congestion, it is also possible to mobilize the masses for a rush loading and unloading; however, this is not a fundamental solution after all, and the fundamental solution is to adopt revolutionary methods, that is, mass movement methods. Concentrate superior forces, win in one battle, and then take care of the rest.

　　The victorious fact of the technical revolution of loading and unloading mechanization and semi-mechanization led by the Xuanwu District Committee of the Communist Party of China powerfully tells people: the revolutionary situation is infinitely good, the style of the masses is infinitely high, the leadership holds high the revolutionary banner, makes good strategic deployments and battle mobilizations, and the revolutionary people with a high degree of communist style will come at the sound of the wind and throw themselves into the battle.

    闻风而来

    北京宣武区大搞装卸机械化和半机械化的技术革新，在短短二十天中，使广安门和西便门两个车站及仓库的装卸工作从根本上扫除了几千年来的笨重劳动。参加革新斗争的，从职业情况看，有工人，有解放军官兵，还有教师、学生、街道居民；从相互关系看，有在工作上互有关连的，也有在工作上没有直接关系的；从地区看，有本区的，有不是本区的，还有远自几百里以外的唐山闻风而来的。声势浩大，蔚为奇观。
    一个地方闹革命，四面八方闻风而来，全力支援的事情，可算革命战争时期的老情况。凡是经历过历次国内革命战争和抗日民族解放斗争的人，谁都可以举出无数生动的事例，叙述当年的革命群众如何热气腾腾，斗志昂扬，参加革命，如何赤胆忠心、箪食壶浆，支援前线。今天，这个群众性的革命风暴又在生产建设战线上出现了。时光不能倒流，而革命的优良传统则是万古千秋。在技术革命中，大兴协作之风，从事各行各业的人，有关系的和没有关系的，本地的和外地的，闻协作之风纷纷而来。这里，并不是有什么物质刺激，吸引了这些人，而是瑰丽的社会主义建设图景，和伟大的政治理想在吸引着他们。正因为如此，他们有着忘我的精神和崇高的共产主义风格。这种崇高的忘我的共产主义风格比一般的劳动不计报酬的风格又高得多了。
    革命，从来就是群众运动。历史的经验如此，技术革命和技术革新已有的经验也是如此。我们的国家在民主革命时期的最大穷根，就是压在人民头上的三座大山——帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义。这个穷根随着民主革命的胜利彻底挖掉了。历史进入了社会主义建设时期，我们的最大穷根，就是经济落后和文化落后，而经济落后的突出表现之一是笨重的手工劳动占了很大的比重。要挖掉这个穷根，不是斯斯文文所能实现的，需要来几次风暴。席卷全国的风起云涌的以机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，正是这样的大风暴。北京宣武区两个车站的装卸机械化和半机械化的技术革新所以能在二十天里迅速实现，归根到底，决定性的关键在于群众的革命行动。
    在运输战线上，装卸工作仍然是当前一个最突出的薄弱环节。卸不下来就装不上去，装不上去就行走不动。最后的情况是：码头堵塞，运输车辆“跑在中间、窝在两头”而需货单位却在停工待料。当然，在堵塞严重的时候，也可以动员群众来一个突击装卸；然而，这毕竟不是根本办法，根本的办法还是要采取革命的办法，即群众运动的办法。集中优势兵力，一战而胜，再及其余。
    中共宣武区领导的装卸机械化和半机械化的技术革命的胜利事实，有力地告诉人们：革命的形势无限好，群众的风格无限高，领导上高举革命旗帜，作好战略部署和战斗动员，具有高度共产主义风格的革命人民就会闻风而来，投入战斗。
