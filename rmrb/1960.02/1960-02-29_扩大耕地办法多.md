Many Ways to Expand Cultivated Land
Yang Ling

Whenever "planting more and harvesting more" is mentioned, some people think: this is something that can only be done in places with vast land and sparse population; in places with little land and many people, all the land that can be planted has already been planted with crops, so how can we plant more?

Advanced and hardworking farmers do not see it this way. They believe: there is plenty of land, the solution lies in people! The greater the enthusiasm of the people, the greater the potential of the land! Not only can the yield per unit area be greatly increased on the existing sown area, but the new sown area can also be greatly increased.

There is a people's commune in Jiangxi Province where each person has only a little more than one mu of land on average. Last year, the grain yield averaged more than 1,100 jin per mu, and each person had an average of more than 1,000 jin of grain. This is of course a very remarkable thing. However, most of the cadres and members of this commune are ambitious people. They will never be complacent about this, and this year they have formulated a new plan for continued leap forward: the total grain output will be increased by another 30% compared with last year. How to achieve the leap forward plan? The commune party committee mobilized the masses, and many commune members spontaneously organized survey teams to survey the mountains, canals, land, and forests throughout the commune; in just over ten days, the commune members put forward more than 3,000 suggestions for increasing production. The commune leadership systematically sorted out the opinions from the masses, formulated ten measures to increase production by utilizing land, and immediately implemented them in various contracted production units. They are now ready to expand the land needed for more than 3,000 mu of early rice, and can expand the sown area by more than 8,000 mu throughout the year; coupled with turning low-yield fields into high-yield fields, there is a practical and reliable guarantee for increasing production by 30% compared with last year. Who wants to know what "great ambition and steady steps" really mean? This is a vivid example. Who wants to know how strengthening the leadership of the Party and resolutely relying on the masses can "be forged into one"? This is also a vivid example. This commune is the Yangkou People's Commune in Guangfeng County. All places that feel "there are many people and little land, and it is impossible to plant more and harvest more" should learn from the party committee and members of this commune.

The unreasonable land use situation left over from the past has not been completely eliminated in many places. The establishment and sound development of people's communes provide the most favorable conditions for eliminating these unreasonable or insufficiently reasonable legacies. The further development of people's subjective initiative has a broad world. "The sea is wide for fish to leap, and the sky is high for birds to fly." Without a wide sea and high sky, it is futile to want to fly and leap; with a wide sea and high sky, it is also futile if you do not fly and leap. Now is the era of the Great Leap Forward, and we should make full use of the unprecedentedly favorable conditions to break through natural and past man-made obstacles on the vast land. The Yangkou Commune combined more than 3,000 paddy fields of about one mu each into plots of more than 20 mu each, reduced field ridges, straightened roads, and expanded more than 300 mu of cultivated land, and irrigation and transportation became much more convenient. They combined five canals into one canal running along the foot of the mountain, which not only did not occupy fields but also expanded the irrigation area, which increased the land utilization area of the entire commune by 300 mu. Arranging vegetable gardens, feed land, etc., on the sides of mountains, ponds, ditches, roads, and in front of and behind houses; replacing the land reserved for fruit tree cultivation with mountains, there are more than 3,000 mu of land for planting food crops. Planting early rice early and expanding the area of continuous cropping and intercropping can also increase the sown area by several thousand mu. The adjustment of contracted production units and the adjustment of interspersed land between units are also greatly conducive to improving land utilization. If people can use land rationally, one mu of land can have the effect of two, three, or even more mu of land. In places with little land and many people, improving land utilization is extremely important.

In our country, we are never afraid of having too many people. The more human power is brought into play, the more land power can be brought into play. Imperialists have long been hoping that we will suffer setbacks in economic construction because of the large population and little land. This is to look at the relationship between people and land with the situation under the capitalist system and with a capitalist perspective. Our brave and hardworking people have used a lot of creative actions to prove that "many people" is the greatest benefit, and will continue to create miracles of planting more and harvesting more in the situation of "little land."

    扩大耕地办法多
    杨岭
    一提起“多种多收”，有人就会想到：这是地广人稀的地方的事情；在地少人多的地方，能种的地早就都种了庄稼，还怎么再多种呢？
    先进的勤劳的农民群众不是这个看法。他们认为：土地有的是，办法在于人！人的劲头越大，地的劲头就越足！不但在已有的播种面积上还可以大大提高单位产量，而且可以大大增加新的播种面积。
    江西有个人民公社，每人平均只有一亩多田，去年粮食产量平均每亩已经达到一千一百多斤，每人平均已经有一千几百斤粮食了。这当然是很了不起的事情。但是，这个社的大多数干部和社员都是有雄心大志的人，他们决不就此自满起来，今年又制订了新的继续跃进计划：粮食总产量要比去年再提高30％。怎样实现跃进计划？公社党委发动了群众，许多社员就自动组织勘查团，查遍全社的山头、渠道、土地、树林；十几天的时间，社员们就提出了三千多条增产计策。公社领导方面把从群众中来的意见加以系统的整理，制定了十条利用土地的增产措施，并且立即落实到各个包产单位。他们现在已经准备好了扩大三千多亩早稻所需要的土地，全年总共可以扩大八千多亩播种面积；再加上低产田变高产田，比去年增产30％就有了切实可靠的保证。谁要想知道究竟怎样才是“雄心要大，脚步要稳”吗？这就是个活生生的例子。谁要想知道加强党的领导和坚决依靠群众怎样“铸成一体”吗？这也是一个活生生的例子。这个公社就是广丰县的洋口人民公社。所有感到“人多地少，无法多种多收”的地方，都应该向这个公社的党委和社员们学习。
    过去的时代遗留下来的土地利用不合理的情况，在不少地方还没有完全消除。人民公社的建立和健全发展，为消除这些不合理或不够合理的遗迹，提供了最有利的条件。人的主观能动性的进一步发挥，有了广阔的天地。“海阔凭鱼跃，天空任鸟飞。”没有海阔天空，纵然想飞想跃，那是枉然；有了海阔天空，如果不飞不跃，也是枉然。现在是大跃进的时代，应该充分运用空前有利的条件，在广大的土地上突破自然的和过去人为的障碍。洋口公社把三千多个每丘一亩左右的水田并成每丘二十多亩，减少了田埂，改直了道路，就扩大了三百多亩耕地，并且灌溉和交通也方便得多了。他们把五条渠道并成了一条沿着山脚走的渠道，既不占田又扩大了灌溉面积，这又使全社增加土地利用面积三百亩。把菜地、饲料地等等安排到山边、塘边、沟边、路边、屋前屋后；把留作栽培果树的土地换到山上，就又多了三千多亩地种植粮食作物。提早种植早稻，扩大连作、套种面积，又可以增加好几千亩播种面积。包产单位的调整和各单位之间插花地的调整，也大大有利于提高土地利用率。人能合理地使用土地，一亩地就可以有二亩、三亩甚至更多的土地的作用。在地少人多的地方，提高土地利用率是极其重要的。
    在我们的国家里，决不害怕人多。人力越来越多地发挥出来，地力也就能越来越多地发挥出来。帝国主义者早在盼望着我们因为人多地少而在经济建设上遭受失败，这是以资本主义制度下的情况和资本主义的眼光看人和地的关系。我国勇敢勤劳的人民已经用大量创造性的行动证明了“人多”是件最大的好处，也将不断地在“地少”的情况下创造多种多收的奇迹。
