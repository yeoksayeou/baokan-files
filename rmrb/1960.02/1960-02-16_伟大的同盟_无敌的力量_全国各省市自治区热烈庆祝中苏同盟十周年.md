Leaders of local Party committees, governments, and people's organizations, along with representatives from all walks of life, attended the celebratory receptions.

Personnel from the consulates of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries stationed in various parts of China, as well as Soviet experts and experts from other fraternal countries who are helping with construction in various parts of China, were invited to attend the receptions.

Leaders of local Party committees and governments, or leaders of the CPPCC and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, spoke at the receptions. In their speeches, they all emphasized that the great Sino-Soviet alliance is a strong fortress of world peace and an invincible force against imperialist aggression. Over the past decade, the great alliance formed by the 850 million people of China and the Soviet Union has made tremendous contributions to defending world peace and has powerfully promoted the common high tide of construction in both China and the Soviet Union. In their speeches, local leaders expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet Party, government, and people for their fraternal assistance to China's socialist construction and wished Sino-Soviet friendship would last forever.

We must consolidate and develop the unity of China and the Soviet Union and the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union to smash all the conspiracies of imperialism. Soviet expert Ye. Ye.

Nikifanov also spoke at the meeting. He said that the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union has a long history and is becoming more and more consolidated and developed.
