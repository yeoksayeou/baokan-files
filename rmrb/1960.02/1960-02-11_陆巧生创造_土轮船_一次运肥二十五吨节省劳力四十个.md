(Reported by this newspaper) In the Great Leap Forward years of 1958 and 1959, Lu Qiaosheng, a youth technical innovation shock worker from Zhejiang Province who innovated and created advanced agricultural tools such as pump-driven waterwheels, single-person pedal waterwheels, six-row strip seeders, five-row precision seeders, and the rice steam germination method, and who cultivated "ten thousand grains per catty" rice, has, upon entering 1960, successfully created an "earthen boat," which can save a considerable amount of labor in fertilizer transportation.

On New Year's Day 1960, the "earthen boat" powered by a pump, created by Lu Qiaosheng, set sail.

Early on, Lu Qiaosheng wanted to find a way to solve the fertilizer transportation problem. After much thought, he believed there was only one way out: "Get labor from tools." Seeing the small boats in the canal, he thought they were great, so he went to carpenter Yao Zhiqing to discuss modifying an earthen boat with a pump. Initially, they used the force of the water discharged by the pump as power, but it failed. Later, they switched to a propeller, but that also failed. After several modifications and experiments, none worked. Lu Qiaosheng immediately held a Zhuge Liang meeting with everyone and went to consult with people at the shipping company, only to learn that the propeller was not up to standard. After several more days and nights of hard work, they finally succeeded. After trial use, this "earthen boat" can tow seven to ten wooden boats at a time, transporting over 25 tons of fertilizer, saving 40 laborers. The ideal of river transportation becoming mechanized has become a reality.

Lu Qiaosheng always pays attention to finding shortcuts, grasping key points, using his brain, and engaging in creation when doing various kinds of production.

Once, when Lu Qiaosheng went to Lin'an to study, he saw a water-powered mill pounding rice. How could the water mill turn so well? He went closer and saw that it was because the waterwheel was cleverly made. He immediately drew a picture of it and, upon returning, worked on it with Yao Zhiqing. After four days and four and a half nights of hard work, they finally succeeded. One pump can drive two waterwheels, saving twelve laborers a day. This tool was quickly promoted throughout the county.

Last year, Dama Commune planted 5,018 mu of early rice, but they did not use even one fen of seedling fields. Where did the seedlings come from? It turned out that they all used steam-based seedling cultivation.

After the sowing season was brought forward in the spring of 1958, seedling rot was very serious. Lu Qiaosheng analyzed the causes of seedling rot in the local area and found that the main problem was poor germination. He thought, wheat sprouts are germinated using steam, and the sprouts emerge evenly and quickly. Couldn't rice seeds also use this method? He told his idea to the township party committee. Party Secretary Li Rujun immediately encouraged him, saying, "Go back and try it boldly!" Lu Qiaosheng found a closed room, placed four pots against the wall to generate steam, and placed the grain seeds in silkworm trays to prepare for germination. He also invited cadres from each small team to watch and provide improvement suggestions. After three days of hard work, the germination rate of the grain seeds reached over 93%. These germinated seeds, when sown in the fields, not only did not rot, but also could be transplanted in six to ten days, ten days to half a month earlier than ordinary seedling fields. Later, with the support of Zhang Binghen, the first secretary of the county party committee, Lu Qiaosheng and Shen Lufu further developed it into a steam-based rapid seedling cultivation method, which freed the entire seedling cultivation process from natural control and put it entirely under human control.

In 1958, Lu Qiaosheng attended the National Congress of Young Activists in Socialist Construction. In Beijing, he visited the National Agricultural Exhibition and learned about the advanced experience of the youth in Qibian County, Guangxi, who had grown 5,000 catties of rice per mu. He immediately asked the guide about the cultivation experience and wrote to Qibian to request three catties of seeds, which he and Hua Baohua, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, and others began to try planting. As a result, they created the "ten thousand grains per catty" good rice variety.

Before liberation, Lu Qiaosheng was a beggar. Who turned him around, making him a young advanced pacesetter, a representative to the National People's Congress, and a communist fighter? Who enabled him to master basic knowledge of culture and science and encouraged him to move forward continuously? It is the Party. Whenever he mentions the Party, he says with excitement, "Without the Party, there would be no Lu Qiaosheng." Therefore, he regards the socialist cause led by the Party as his own cause and regards contributing to socialist construction as the greatest happiness!

    陆巧生创造“土轮船”
    一次运肥二十五吨节省劳力四十个
    本报讯　在大跃进的1958年和1959年革新和创造了抽水机带水车、单人脚踏水车、六行条播机、五行点播机等先进农具和水稻蒸汽催芽法，种出了“万粒斤”水稻的浙江省青年技术革新突击手陆巧生，一跨进1960年，他又创造成功了“土轮船”，使运肥能节约出不少劳力。
    1960年元旦，陆巧生创造的一部用抽水机做动力的“土轮船”开航了。
    很早，陆巧生就想找个办法解决运肥问题。他左想右想，认为出路只有一条：“向工具要劳力”。他看到运河中的小轮船怪好，就去找木工姚之庆商量用抽水机改装土轮船的事。他们起初用抽水机出水的冲力作动力，失败了；后来改用螺旋桨，也失败了；又经过几次改装和试验，都不行。陆巧生立即同大家一起开诸葛亮会，又跑去向轮船公司的人请教，才知道原来是螺旋桨做得不合格。以后又经几个昼夜的苦战，终于搞成了。经过试用，这只“土轮船”一次可以拖七只到十只木船，可运肥二十五吨以上，节省四十个劳力。河上运输拖带化的理想变成了现实。
    陆巧生在做各项生产时，处处注意找窍门，抓关键，动脑筋，搞创造。
    一次，陆巧生去临安学习时，看到一部水碓在打米。水碓怎样转得这样好呢？他走近一看，原来是水轮造得巧。他立刻照着画了个图样，回来就和姚之庆照着干起来，忙了四天四个半夜，终于搞成了。一部抽水机可以带两部水车，一天就节省十二个劳力。这个工具很快在全县推广了。
    去年，大麻公社种了五千零一十八亩早稻，可是连一分秧田也没有用。秧苗是从哪来的呢？原来他们全部采用了蒸汽育秧。
    1958年春天播种期提早以后，烂秧很严重。陆巧生分析了一下当地烂秧的原因，主要是催芽不好。他想，麦芽是用蒸汽催芽的，芽出得又齐又快，稻种不是也可以采用这个办法吗？他把这个意见告诉了乡党委。党委书记李如俊立即鼓励他说：“你回去大胆试试看！”陆巧生就找了一间密室，靠墙放四口锅子烧蒸汽，把谷种放在蚕匾里准备催芽。他又请各小队干部去看，提了改进意见。苦战了三天，谷种出芽率达93％以上。这种芽谷播种到田里不仅不烂秧，而且六天到十天就可以插秧，比一般秧田提早十天到半个月。后来陆巧生和沈禄富在县委第一书记张冰痕同志支持下，又进一步把它发展成蒸汽快速育秧法，这样就使整个育秧过程摆脱了自然的控制，完全听人的指挥了。
    1958年陆巧生出席全国社会主义建设青年积极分子代表大会。在北京他参观了全国农业展览会，知道了广西畦边县青年种出的水稻亩产五千斤的先进事迹。他立刻向讲解员请教了培育的经验，并写信到畦边要来了三斤种子，和团支部书记华宝华等一起试种起来，结果创造了水稻“万粒斤”良种。
    陆巧生解放前是讨饭的叫花子。是谁使他翻了身，成了青年先进标兵、全国人民代表大会代表和共产主义战士呢？是谁使他掌握了文化科学基本知识，并鼓舞他不断前进呢？是党。一提起党，他就满怀激动地说：“没有党就没有我陆巧生。”因此，他把党所领导的社会主义事业看成自己的切身的事业，把为社会主义建设出力看成是最大的幸福！
