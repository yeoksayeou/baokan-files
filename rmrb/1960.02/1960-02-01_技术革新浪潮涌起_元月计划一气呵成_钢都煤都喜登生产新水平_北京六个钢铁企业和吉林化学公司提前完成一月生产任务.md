Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, January 31st. Anshan Iron and Steel Company (An'gang) completed its January production plan for major products such as steel, steel materials, and steel billets ahead of schedule and with overfulfillment. As of the 30th, steel exceeded the plan by 0.7%, steel billets by 0.3%, and steel materials by 4.4%. The output of these products greatly exceeded the production level of December last year, breaking the old rule that January production levels are low.

In January, An'gang successively launched two joint technical performance competition weeks and one joint technical performance competition ten-day period. As of the 30th, workers in various factories and mines had proposed a total of 134,770 technical innovation suggestions focusing on key and weak links in production, of which 25,255 were implemented. In addition, more than 6,900 advanced experiences were promoted. Wang Wenduo, assistant of No. 2 open hearth furnace in the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant, created a new method for patching the front wall, which extended the life of the open hearth furnace front wall by two to three times compared to the old method, and reduced the patching time by about 20%. This new method has also achieved good results after being promoted in other open hearth furnaces. In the past three days, workers at the Rolling Plate Plant have implemented more than 1,200 technical innovations, including improving the roll shape of rolling mills alone, which can increase steel plate production by more than 50,000 tons annually.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 30th. Fushun Mining Bureau launched a technical innovation and technical revolution movement this year centered on vigorously promoting mechanization and automation, completing the January coal production plan two days ahead of schedule. As of the 29th, coal production increased by 1,834 tons more than planned, tunneling exceeded the plan by 48.2 meters, the average daily output of raw coal increased by 5.8% compared to December last year, coal quality was excellent, and safe production was achieved.

In the past few days, coal miners who persisted in production have greeted the new spring with better production achievements. On the 28th, the bureau achieved fifty major innovation proposals. Among them, the Transportation Department, in response to the key issue of thick ice and snow on both sides of the railway affecting transportation in winter, successfully trial-produced an electric ice-sweeping machine, replacing the labor of more than 150 people and improving efficiency by 500 times. On the 28th and 29th, the average daily output of raw coal for the bureau increased by 7% compared to the average daily output before the 27th, and the output on the 30th increased again compared to the 29th.

The Fushun Mining District Party Committee, in order to realize semi-mechanization or mechanization of heavy manual operations, launched a technical innovation and technical revolution movement among the workers. Now, this movement has developed from individual innovations to complete sets of innovations, from reforming individual types of work to promoting the mechanization and automation of the entire production process. From the 1st to the 28th, workers in the bureau proposed more than 41,000 suggestions for improving process regulations, reforming equipment and tools, etc., of which more than 11,500 were implemented, and 831 various small machines were manufactured, which effectively ensured the overfulfillment of the January production plan.

Xinhua News Agency, January 31st. Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, Beijing Steel Plant, Beijing Special Steel Plant, Xuanwu Iron and Steel Plant, Miyun Iron and Steel Plant, and Yanqing Iron and Steel Plant completed their January production plans ahead of schedule.

As of the 30th, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company's steel, pig iron, and steel materials exceeded the January plan by 10.4%, 2.2%, and 13% respectively, and the pass rate of these three products all reached the national required indicators. Beijing Steel Plant and Beijing Special Steel Plant exceeded their January steel production plans by 10% and 15.7% respectively. Xuanwu Iron and Steel Plant also fully completed its January production tasks.

In the process of striving to fully overfulfill the January production plan, all factories have taken a series of specific measures. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company converter steelmaking test plant achieved eleven major technical innovation projects in more than twenty days, achieving great results. The company's ironmaking plant boldly adopted a series of advanced measures "taking wind as the key," breaking through boundary wind pressure and increasing smelting intensity. On the first day of the Spring Festival, No. 1 and No. 2 blast furnaces overproduced 217 tons of pig iron.

Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, January 31st. Jilin Chemical Industrial Company reported a victory in January production. As of the 29th, the total output value completed 101.3% of the monthly plan, an increase of 0.1% compared to December last year, and an increase of 1.6 times compared to the same period last year. The output of major products such as ammonium nitrate, calcium carbide, methanol, formaldehyde, An'an Blue, yellow phosphorus, and red phosphorus all completed the monthly plan ahead of schedule and with overfulfillment. The daily output of fifteen major products such as synthetic ammonia, ammonium nitrate, formaldehyde, glacial acetic acid, and An'an Blue also set the highest record since the company started production. The quality of all products met the national standards, the total cost was 3.39% lower than the monthly plan, and labor productivity increased by 158.7% compared to the same period last year.

In order to continuously improve the production level, the company launched a technical innovation movement in January with the main content of realizing automation, continuous operation, and mechanization. Employees throughout the company proposed a total of 7,920 rationalization proposals, of which 840 have been implemented, increasing production efficiency by one to 450 times respectively.

    技术革新浪潮涌起　元月计划一气呵成
    钢都煤都喜登生产新水平
    北京六个钢铁企业和吉林化学公司提前完成一月生产任务
    新华社鞍山31日电　鞍钢提前超额完成了1月份钢、钢材、钢坯等主要产品的生产计划。到30日止，钢超过计划0．7％，钢坯超过计划0．3％，钢材超过计划4．4％。这些产品的产量都大大超过了去年12月份的生产水平，打破了历年1月份生产水平低的旧规。
    1月份，鞍钢连续展开了两次联合技术表演竞赛周和一次联合技术表演竞赛旬。到30日止，各厂矿职工围绕生产关键和薄弱环节共提出技术革新建议十三万四千七百七十件，实现的有二万五千二百五十五件，此外还推广了六千九百多项先进经验。第一炼钢厂二号平炉助手汪文铎创造了新的贴前墙方法，使平炉前墙的寿命比用老方法延长了二到三倍，贴前墙的时间缩短了20％左右。这一新方法在其他平炉推广后，也收到良好效果。轧板厂职工最近三天就实现技术革新一千二百多件，其中仅改进轧钢机辊形一项，全年就可增产钢板五万多吨。
    新华社沈阳30日电　抚顺矿务局今年开展以大搞机械化自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，提前两天完成了1月份的煤炭生产计划。到29日止，比计划增产了煤炭一千八百三十四吨，掘进超过计划48．2米，原煤平均日产水平比去年12月份提高5．8％，煤炭质量优良，并且作到了安全生产。
    这几天，坚持生产的煤矿职工，以更好的生产成就迎接了新春。28日，全局实现重大革新建议五十件，其中运输部针对冬季铁道两侧冰雪厚积影响运输的关键，试制成功一台电动攉冰机，代替了一百五十多人的劳动，提高效率五百倍。28日和29日，全局原煤平均日产量，比27日以前的平均日产量增长7％，30日的产量又比29日提高。
    抚顺矿区党委为了使笨重的手工操作实现半机械化或机械化，发动职工群众开展了技术革新和技术革命运动。现在，这个运动已经从单项的革新发展到成套的革新，从改革单项工种操作到促使全部生产过程实现机械化和自动化的新阶段。从1日到28日，全局职工共提出改进工艺规程、改革设备工具等方面的建议四万一千多件，实现了一万一千五百多件，制造出来各种小型机械八百三十一台，有力地保证了1月份生产计划的超额完成。
    新华社31日讯　石景山钢铁公司、北京钢厂、北京特殊钢厂、宣武钢铁厂、密云钢铁厂、延庆钢铁厂提前完成了1月份生产计划。
    到30日止，石景山钢铁公司的钢、生铁和钢材分别超过1月份计划10．4％、2．2％和13％，这三种产品的合格率都达到了国家要求指标。北京钢厂、北京特殊钢厂分别超额10％和15．7％完成了1月份的钢产量计划。宣武钢铁厂也全面完成了1月份生产任务。
    在力争全面超额完成1月份生产计划过程中，各个工厂都采取了一系列具体措施。石景山钢铁公司转炉炼钢试验厂在二十多天中实现了十一项重大的技术革新项目，取得很大效果。这个公司的炼铁厂大胆采用了“以风为纲”的一系列先进措施，突破界线风压，提高冶炼强度，春节第一天，一号、二号高炉就超产生铁二百十七吨。
    新华社吉林31日电　吉林化学工业公司元月生产告捷。截至29日为止，总产值完成月计划101．3％，比去年12月份提高0．1％，比去年同期提高一点六倍，硝铵、电石、甲醇、甲醛、安安蓝、黄磷、赤磷等主要产品的产量，都提前超额完成了月计划；合成氨、硝铵、甲醛、冰醋酸、安安蓝等十五种主要产品的日产量，还创造了公司开工生产以来的最高纪录。产品质量全部合乎国家规定标准，总成本比月计划降低3．39％，劳动生产率比去年同期提高158．7％。
    为了不断提高生产水平，这个公司元月份开展了以实现自动化、连续化、机械化为主要内容的技术革新运动。全公司职工共提出合理化建议七千九百二十件，已实现的八百四十件，分别提高生产效率一到四百五十倍。
