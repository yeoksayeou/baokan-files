Establish Feed Bases and Develop Feed Production
Commentator of this newspaper

Feed is the material foundation for developing the pig-raising industry. To raise pigs well, have them reproduce more, grow fatter, and grow faster, there must be sufficient feed. With the great development of the collective pig-raising industry, the number of pigs in many regions will increase several times or even several times over, making it particularly important to seriously solve the feed problem. Since the launch of the pig-raising campaign, many regions have deeply realized that abundant feed is the fundamental guarantee for the high-speed development of pig-raising, and have proposed to arrange pig feed in the same way as arranging food rations for people, which is completely correct. The fact is also that, wherever the feed work is grasped tightly and well, the pigs there develop quickly; conversely, the pigs develop slowly or even fail to develop. Massively developing the pig-raising industry is an important key to achieving the continued leap forward in agricultural production in 1960. In order to strive for the continued leap forward in agricultural production in our country in 1960, we must ensure that our pig-raising industry has a greater development, and solving the feed problem well is an important link in successfully realizing the pig-raising task in 1960. In solving the feed problem, we should implement the policy of walking on two legs, both collecting, storing, and processing all agricultural and sideline products and wild feed that can be used as feed, and establishing feed bases to plant domestic feed and vigorously develop feed production.

Our country's feed resources are very rich. A large amount of crop stalks, vines, and wild plants can be turned into good pig feed after processing. In the southern regions, aquatic plants are lush and evergreen, and the feed available for utilization is particularly abundant; near the sea, there are various marine animals and plants, all of which are good pig feed. In Sichuan, which is deep inland, there are more than 290 common feeds throughout the province. The sweet potato vine alone can feed more than 20 million pigs. If the province's oil cakes are used to feed pigs first and then fertilize the fields, they can solve the refined feed for millions of pigs. The feed resources in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region on the Northwest Plateau are also rich. The staff and workers of various farms in the Agricultural Second Division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps used their spare time to collect and store more than 10 million catties of wild grass seeds and fruits. If such rich feed resources can be found in the Xinjiang region, they can also be found in other regions.

Currently, we are in the "lean season" period. New feed crops have not yet been produced in most areas, and the feed stored in the past in many areas has been used up. What should we do? Many comrades in various places have raised this question. This is indeed a problem that deserves attention and needs to be solved quickly. Otherwise, it will affect the smooth development of our pig-raising industry. In the "lean season" of spring, do we have a way to solve the feed problem? Not only do we have a way, but we have many ways. Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province, is an example. The Taozhuang and Weitang People's Communes in this county used rice roots to make maltose and feed pigs with the sugar residue, thus solving the feed problem. The Jiaxing Special Zone comprehensively promoted their experience. The 1.2 million pigs in the entire special zone thus obtained more than 4 billion catties of feed, an average of more than 300 catties per pig. Gaohe County, Guangdong Province, is another example. The hydropower station comprehensive processing plant of the Heshui Commune in this county uses rice straw pulp to feed pigs, and each pig gains an average of 24 catties of meat per month. According to the results of many communes in Gaohe County, an average of four cents of paddy field's rice straw can solve the feed for one pig for ten months, and each pig can gain about 200 catties. It can be imagined that if the experiences of Jiaxing and Gaohe and other places are universally promoted in the rice-growing areas of the north and south of the country, the pig-raising feed problem in winter and spring can be solved to a large extent in many regions. More importantly, these experiences show us a truth: as long as we earnestly mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and find ways and shortcuts, any region can discover and find a large amount of feed, and the feed problem can be solved at any time.

Massively collecting and processing various agricultural and sideline products and wild plants is an important way to solve pig feed. All localities should vigorously carry out the processing and utilization of agricultural products and the collection of wild feed; however, relying solely on this method is far from enough to meet the needs of the high-speed development of the pig-raising industry. We must also establish feed bases and develop feed production in a planned way. There are many benefits to establishing feed bases: first, we can plant various high-quality and high-yield feed crops in a planned way, so that pigs can eat nutritious and fresh feed all year round, thereby raising pigs fatter and stronger; second, we can save a lot of labor. Labor is the fundamental factor to ensure the great leap forward in our various construction undertakings. Any undertaking should pay attention to saving labor, so that we can reduce production costs and use labor in the most needed undertakings. Establishing feed bases and developing feed production in a planned way can greatly save labor due to centralized production, high yields, and other reasons. The Guishan Commune in Yiliang County, Yunnan Province, has twelve pig farms in the Muzhu Management Area. Before planting feed land, it took 33 people every day to collect feed. After having a feed base to plant feed, only 14 people needed to go to the fields to dig feed, freeing up 19 people to participate in agricultural production.

The rural people's communes have provided extremely favorable conditions for establishing feed bases. The organizational scale of the communes is much larger than that of the former advanced cooperatives, which enables the people's communes to adjust and use cultivated land more rationally than the advanced cooperatives, and to cultivate a large amount of scattered land, vacant land, barren slopes, forest garden land, and water surfaces in a planned way. It can also use labor more effectively than the advanced cooperatives, organize professional teams, and mobilize the vast number of commune members to carry out rush planting.

Some people are afraid that planting feed will affect grain production, so they are unwilling to plant feed crops, let alone establish feed production bases. When the masses do not have experience, this concern is difficult to completely avoid. We should conduct in-depth propaganda to the masses through concrete facts to dispel their concerns. We believe that as long as the measures are appropriate, not only will it not affect grain production, but it can also promote grain production, and many places have already made great achievements and created a lot of experience. These experiences can be summarized as fully utilizing the land, practicing intercropping and multiple cropping to increase harvests, and making one mu of land play the role of several mu. The Dongjiao People's Commune in Licheng, Shandong, harvested a total of 34,000 catties of zucchini, radishes, and cabbage on one mu of feed land, which can raise eight to ten pigs. If the country universally reaches such a yield, it would only take 70 million mu of feed land to realize one pig per person. More importantly, we must see the mutually promoting relationship between pigs and grain: more pigs provide a large amount of organic fertilizer for grain production, ensuring a bumper grain harvest; increased grain production provides more refined feed for pigs, promoting the great development of the pig-raising industry. "More pigs, more fertilizer; more fertilizer, more grain; more grain, more pigs" is the most practical and profound understanding of the relationship between pigs and grain by the masses. Other methods, such as implementing comprehensive management of feed land, planting high-yield crops such as corn, multi-eared sorghum, and tubers that can be used as both grain and feed; intercropping feed in grain fields; using winter fallow land and fallow land to plant pig feed; using forest land to intercrop feed; using field edges, corners, pond water surfaces, abandoned land, and barren slopes to plant feed, etc., are all good methods that solve both the grain problem and the feed problem; they do not occupy more cultivated land, and can obtain a large amount of feed. It can be seen that the potential in this area is great. As long as we let go and mobilize the masses to come up with ideas and find ways, every place can find a good way that is both perfect and suitable for its own specific situation, and can establish its own feed production base.

The feed base is best combined with the pig farm. This method of combining breeding and planting can both produce feed according to needs and greatly save manpower and improve labor efficiency. The Dongjiao People's Commune in Licheng County, Shandong Province, built the pig farm in the high-yield square, fixed the feed land to the pig farm, and the breeders are responsible for both raising pigs and producing feed. The local commune members call this method of combining high-yield square, pig farm, and feed land "shooting three eagles with one arrow" and achieving a triple harvest of grain, meat, and feed. They believe that the benefits of doing so are that feed is produced according to the needs of the pigs, and green, refined, and coarse feed can be solved at the same time, and can be reasonably matched and adjusted; on-site production, on-site processing, on-site feeding, and on-site accumulation and application of fertilizer can save a large amount of manpower and animal power; it can improve the breeders' sense of enterprise and labor efficiency, and be fully responsible from feed production to the pigs leaving the pen and seeing meat, and comprehensive labor utilization can combine light and heavy work. High-yield and nutritious miscellaneous grains and juicy feed crops should be planted on the feed land. Guangdong Province regards the three sweet potatoes (sweet potato, cassava, yam), three taros (taro, banana taro, bamboo taro), and three melons (pumpkin, papaya, Hainan melon) and three beans (dog claw bean, woody bean, sparrow egg bean) as twelve treasures for developing animal husbandry, and advocating mass planting can indeed achieve fast, good, and economical results. Other good feed crops include corn, carrots, forage grass, water hyacinth, Jerusalem artichoke, and pumpkin. The stems, leaves, and melons of pumpkin and Jerusalem artichoke can be used, and cultivation management is simple. Generally, each mu can harvest 14,000 to 15,000 catties. Carrots are called feed ginseng by some people, and they taste sweet and all kinds of livestock love to eat them. The leaves are also very effective for feeding pigs after fermentation. One mu of water surface of water hyacinth can produce 300,000 catties, the texture is soft, and it has been widely used in various places. In the southern region, the nutritional content of forage grass is higher than that of water hyacinth and sweet potato vines. Each mu can produce more than 500,000 catties, and it can be planted all year round. It is a feed crop with great development prospects. Various places can plant according to specific circumstances. Corn is called the "king of feed." Its yield per unit area is very high. Generally, each mu can harvest 300 to 400 catties. If there is sufficient water and fertilizer and careful management, the yield can be greatly increased. In 1959, the Hanbei Commune in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, had 100 mu of corn, with an average yield of more than 2,000 catties. If highly dense planting is implemented and harvested as green feed during the waxy ripe period, each mu can harvest more than 10,000 catties. Corn has strong adaptability and can be planted in the south, north, plains, mountains, sandy soil, yellow mud, or other soil types. At the same time, the sowing season is long, and it can be planted from spring to autumn. Some areas can also plant two or three crops a year. The whole body of corn is a treasure. Corn kernels can be used as refined feed, corn leaves and corn tips can be used to feed livestock, and corn cobs and corn stalks can be crushed and used to feed pigs. Corn stalks are even better feed for livestock after silage. The nutritional value of corn is very high. One catty of corn has the nutritional content equivalent to 1.35 catties of oats or 1.3 catties of barley, or 1.2 catties of sorghum. Therefore, whether in terms of human food and livestock feed requirements, corn should be raised to the position of staple food and the planting area should be appropriately expanded.

Now the spring plowing production is about to begin. Under the overall plan of agricultural production in 1960, all people's communes should make overall consideration of feed production in a timely manner according to the annual pig-raising plan, and gradually establish feed bases to lay a good material foundation for the large-scale development of the pig-raising industry.

    建立饲料基地　发展饲料生产
    本报评论员
    饲料是发展养猪业的物质基础。要把猪养得好，生得多，长得肥，长得快，就必须有充足的饲料。随着集体养猪业的大发展，很多地区养猪数量都将成倍以至几倍地增长，认真解决饲料问题，就显得特别重要。开展养猪运动以来，不少地区已经深刻体会到丰足的饲料是高速度发展养猪的根本保证，提出了要像抓人的口粮一样来安排养猪饲料，这是完全正确的。事实也是这样，凡是对饲料工作抓得紧抓得好的地区，那里的猪就发展得快，反之猪就发展得慢甚至发展不起来。大量发展养猪事业是实现1960年农业生产继续跃进的一个重要关键。为了争取我国1960年的农业生产继续跃进，就必须使我国的养猪业有一个更大的发展，而解决好饲料问题，又是胜利实现1960年的养猪任务的重要环节。在解决饲料问题上，应该贯彻两条腿走路的方针，既要大量采集收贮和加工一切能作饲料的农副产品及野生饲料，又要建立饲料基地种植家生饲料，大力发展饲料生产。
    我国的饲料资源是很丰富的，大量的农作物秸秆藤蔓及野生植物，经过加工处理，都能变成猪的好饲料。南方地区水草丰茂，四季长青，可供利用的饲料尤其丰富；近海地区有各种海生动植物，都是猪的好饲料。深处内地的四川，全省最常见的饲料有二百九十多种，仅红薯蔓一项就可养二千多万头猪，全省的油饼如果作到先喂猪后肥田，可解决几百万头猪的精饲料。西北高原的新疆维吾尔自治区饲料同样丰富，新疆建设兵团农二师各场职工利用工余时间仅采集储藏野草籽实就有一千多万斤。新疆地区能够找到这样丰富的饲料资源，在别的地区也是能够找到的。
    目前，正处在“青黄不接”的季节。大部地区新的饲料作物还没有生产起来，不少地区过去贮存的饲料又用得差不多了，怎么办呢？很多地方的同志提出了这个问题。这的确是一个值得重视和需要很快解决的问题。否则就会影响我们的养猪业顺利发展。“青黄不接”的春天，我们有没有办法解决饲料问题呢？不仅有办法，而且办法多得很。浙江嘉兴县就是一个例子，这个县的陶庄、魏塘等人民公社利用稻根作饴糖，糖渣喂猪的办法解决了饲料问题，嘉兴专区全面推广了他们的经验，全专区一百二十多万头猪，因此得到了四十多亿斤饲料，平均每头三百多斤。广东省高鹤县又是一个例子，这个县的合水公社的水电站综合加工厂利用稻草浆喂猪，每头猪一个月平均长肉二十四斤。根据高鹤县许多公社使用的结果，平均四分田的稻草即可解决一头猪十个月的饲料，每头猪可长二百斤左右。可以设想，全国南北水稻地区如果普遍推广嘉兴和高鹤等地的经验，就能在很多地区很大程度上解决冬春的养猪饲料问题。更主要的是这些经验给我们展示了一条真理：只要认真发动群众、依靠群众，想办法找窍门，任何地区都能够发现和找到大量的饲料，任何时候都能够解决饲料问题。
    大量采集和加工各种农副产品及野生植物，是解决养猪饲料的一个重要办法，各地都应该大力进行农产品的加工利用和野生饲料的采集工作；但是单靠这一个办法是远远不能满足高速度发展养猪业需要的，还必须建立饲料基地，有计划地发展饲料生产。建立饲料基地好处多得很：一可以有计划的种植各种质量好产量高的饲料作物，使猪一年四季都能吃到营养丰富而又新鲜的饲料，从而把猪养得更肥更壮；二可以节约大量劳动力。劳动力是保证我们各项建设事业大跃进的根本因素，任何事业都要注意节省劳动力，这样我们才能降低生产成本，才能把劳动力用到最需要的事业上去。建立饲料基地，有计划地发展饲料生产，由于产地集中、产量高等等原因，便可以达到大大节省劳动力的目的。云南省宜良县圭山公社亩竹管理区共有十二个猪场，未种饲料地前，每天需要三十三个人去采集饲料，有了饲料基地种饲料以后，只需要十四人到地里挖饲料就行了，腾出了十九人参加农业生产。
    农村人民公社化后给建立饲料基地提供了极为有利的条件，公社的组织规模比过去的高级社大的多，这就使人民公社能够比高级社更合理地调剂和使用耕地，对大量的零星地、空隙地、荒坡地、林园地、水面等进行有计划的垦种。还可以比高级社更有效地使用劳动力，组织专业队伍，以及动员广大社员突击种植。
    有的人怕种饲料影响粮食生产，因此不愿种植饲料作物，更不愿建立饲料生产基地。当群众还没有经验的时候，这种顾虑是难于完全避免的。应该通过具体的事实向群众进行深入的宣传，解除群众顾虑。我们认为只要措施适当，不仅不会影响粮食产量，还可以促进粮食增产，而且有许多地方已经作出了很大成绩，创造了很多经验。这些经验归纳起来就是充分利用土地，实行间种套作多茬多收，使一亩地起几亩地的作用。山东历城东郊人民公社在一亩饲料地上收了西葫芦、萝卜、洋白菜共三万四千斤，可养猪八到十头。如果全国普遍达到这样的产量，实现一人一口猪，只需要有七千万亩饲料地就够了。更重要的是要看到猪和粮的互相促进的关系：猪多了就为粮食生产提供了大量的有机肥料，保证粮食大丰收；粮食增产了又为猪提供更多的精饲料，促进了养猪业大发展。“猪多、肥多，肥多、粮多，粮多、猪多”，就是群众对猪、粮关系最实际、最深刻的体会。其他如实行饲料地的综合经营，种植既能作粮食又能作饲料的玉米、多穗高粱、薯类等高产作物；在粮食地里套种饲料；利用冬闲地、休耕地种植养猪饲料；利用林地套种饲料；利用田边、地角、池塘水面、废弃地、荒坡地种饲料等等，都是很好的办法，既解决了粮食问题，又解决了饲料问题；既不占用更多的耕地，又能获得大量的饲料。由此可见，这方面的潜力很大，只要放手发动群众出主意想办法，每个地方都能找出两全其美的适合自己具体情况的好办法，都能建立起自己的饲料生产基地。
    饲料基地最好是和养猪场结合起来，这种养种合一的办法既可以根据需要生产饲料，又可以大大节省人力提高劳动效率。山东历城县东郊人民公社把养猪场建在丰产方里，把饲料地固定到养猪场，饲养员又养猪又负责生产饲料，当地社员把这种丰产方、养猪场、饲料地三结合的办法称为一箭射三雕，粮、肉、料三丰收。他们认为这样作的好处是根据猪的需要生产饲料，青、精、粗料能同时解决，又能合理搭配调剂；就地生产、就地加工、就地喂养、就地积肥施肥，可以节省大批人力畜力；可以提高饲养人员的事业心和劳动效率，从饲料生产到猪出栏见肉，全部负责，而且劳力综合利用可以轻重活搭配。饲料地上应该种产量高营养丰富的杂粮和多汁饲料作物，广东省把三薯（番薯、木薯、大薯）三芋（芋头、蕉芋、竹芋）三瓜（南瓜、木瓜、海南瓜）与三豆（狗爪豆、木豆、雀蛋豆）看成发展畜牧业的十二样宝贝，提倡大量种植，确能收到多快好省的效果。其他如玉米、胡萝卜、肉草、水浮莲、菊芋、南瓜都是很好的饲料作物，南瓜、菊芋的茎、叶、瓜都可利用，栽培管理又简单，一般每亩能收一万四、五千斤。葫萝卜有人叫它饲料人参，味道甜美，各种牲畜都爱吃，叶子发酵后喂猪效果也很好。水浮莲一亩水面可产三十万斤，质地柔软，各地已经广泛利用。南方地区的肉草，营养成份比水浮莲、红薯藤还高，每亩可产五十多万斤，一年四季都可种植，是一种很有发展前途的饲料作物。各地可以根据具体情况进行种植。玉米人称“饲料之王”，它的单位面积产量很高，一般每亩可收三、四百斤，如果水肥充足、精心管理，产量还可大大提高。山西武乡县韩北公社1959年有一百亩玉米，平均产量达二千斤以上。如果实行高度密植，在腊熟期收作青饲料，每亩可收一万多斤。玉米的适应性很强，不论南方、北方、平原、山区、沙土、黄泥或其他土质都可以种植。同时播种季节长，从春天到秋天都可种，有的地区一年还可种二、三季。玉米的全身都是宝，玉米籽实可作精饲料，玉米叶、玉米尖可以喂牲口，玉米轴、玉米秸粉碎以后可以喂猪，玉米秸青贮以后更是牲口的好饲料。玉米的营养价值很高，一斤玉米的营养成分相当于一点三五斤燕麦或一点三斤大麦，或一点二斤高粱的营养成分。所以无论就人的粮食和牲口的饲料要求来说，都应该把玉米提到主粮地位，适当扩大种植面积。
    现在春耕生产马上就要到来了，各人民公社应在1960年农业生产的总规划下，根据全年养猪计划，及时对饲料生产作通盘考虑，逐步建立起饲料基地，为大规模发展养猪业打下良好的物质基础。
