    The Treasonous Conspiracy of the Son Sann Group
    Son Sann once served as Deputy Prime Minister of Cambodia, advisor to the Prime Minister, and Ambassador to the UK. He consistently sided with the United States and opposed Cambodia's policy of peace and neutrality. At the end of November 1958, with the support of the United States, he anonymously founded the "Democratic People's News," openly attacking the current Cambodian system and Sihanouk. In early January of last year, he announced the establishment of an opposition party called the "Khmer Democratic Union." Before and after this, Son Sann secretly went to Bangkok to conspire with the US, Thai, and South Vietnamese authorities to subvert the current Cambodian government. However, before they could take action, the Cambodian government uncovered their plot on January 20th of last year. Most of the members of Son Sann's treasonous group were arrested. Son Sann himself fled to Saigon, where he conspired with another traitor, Sơn Ngọc Thành, and advisors from the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc to plan new subversion schemes. They established the so-called "Free Khmer Committee" and organized "Free Khmer armies" in Thailand and South Vietnam. At the same time, within Cambodia, they recruited bandits, corrupt civil servants, and soldiers to engage in sabotage and create chaos, acting as internal collaborators in preparation for a comeback.
    In mid-February of last year, Choun Mochupich, the royal representative of Siem Reap Province and commander of the military region, who was associated with the Son Sann treasonous group, openly launched a rebellion with US support, but it was suppressed by the government. However, the Son Sann treasonous group and its behind-the-scenes supporter, the United States, did not give up. On August 31st of last year, Son Sann planned the palace bombing incident, plotting to assassinate the King and Queen of Cambodia. As a result, Prince Norodom Vakrivan and a palace attendant were killed, and two attendants were injured. At the time, Sihanouk pointed out that the bombing incident was planned by the Sơn Ngọc Thành and Son Sann conspiracy group with foreign assistance. Now, Son Sann's secret letter to Kellogg, the former political counselor of the US Embassy in Cambodia, completely confirms the direct participation of the United States in the Son Sann group's treasonous conspiracy to subvert the legitimate government of Cambodia.

    桑·萨里集团的叛国阴谋
    桑·萨里曾任柬埔寨副首相、首相顾问和驻英大使等职。他一贯亲美，反对柬埔寨执行和平中立政策。1958年11月底，他在美国支持下，隐名创办了“民主人民报”，公开攻击柬埔寨现行制度和西哈努克，在去年1月初又宣布成立名为“高棉民主联盟”的反对党。在这前后，桑·萨里偷偷到曼谷同美国、泰国和南越当局策划颠复柬埔寨现政府的阴谋，但是在他们还没有来得及动手以前，就在去年1月20日被柬埔寨政府一举破获。桑·萨里叛国集团的党羽大部就逮。桑·萨里本人逃到西贡，又在西贡同另一个叛国分子山玉成和东南亚侵略集团的顾问密谋新的颠复计划，成立所谓“自由高棉委员会”，并在泰国和南越组织“自由高棉军队”，同时在柬埔寨国内搜罗一些匪徒、腐化的公务人员和军人从事破坏活动，制造混乱，作为内应，准备东山再起。
    去年2月中，同桑·萨里叛国集团有关系的暹粒省王廷代表兼军区司令琼·莫舒皮在美国支持下公然发动暴乱，也被政府镇压下去。但是桑·萨里叛国集团和它的幕后支持者美国并不就此罢休。去年8月31日，桑·萨里又策划了宫廷爆炸案，阴谋杀害柬埔寨国王和王后，结果诺罗敦·瓦克里万亲王和一个宫廷侍从被炸死，两个侍从受伤。当时西哈努克就指出爆炸事件是山玉成和桑·萨里阴谋集团在外国帮助下策划的。现在，桑·萨里给美国驻柬埔寨使馆前政务参赞凯洛格的密信，完全证实了美国直接参与桑·萨里集团企图颠复柬埔寨合法政府的叛国阴谋。
