Comprehensive report from our newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency reports: Turkish opposition party members and newspapers have recently been increasingly strongly condemning the Turkish-U.S. bilateral military agreement.

    The Turkish-U.S. bilateral military agreement was signed in Ankara on March 5, 1959. The agreement stipulated the establishment of American missile bases in Turkey, and the United States would equip Turkey with atomic weapons. The Turkish National Assembly is currently discussing this agreement. Turkish opposition party Republican People's Party members Muftuoglu, Ecevit, and Eroglu, among others, pointed out that this agreement is incompatible with national independence and national dignity.

    The Republican People's Party's official newspaper, "Ulus," also condemned the Turkish-U.S. bilateral military agreement for giving the U.S. armed forces the right to "interfere in Turkey's internal affairs."

    "Vatan" wrote that this agreement violates the Turkish constitution and existing laws. "Yon" magazine went further, asking whether the Turkish Democratic Party's rulers intend to describe the legitimate demands of the majority of citizens to demand the Democratic Party to return their rights as a "conspiracy of international communism" when necessary, thereby begging for American help?

    土耳其一些反对党议员和报刊
    谴责土美双边军事协定
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：土耳其反对党议员和报刊近来日益强烈地谴责土耳其—美国双边军事协定。
    土—美双边军事协定是1959年3月5日在安卡拉签订的，协定规定在土耳其建立美国导弹基地，美国并以原子武器装备土耳其。土耳其国民议会目前正在讨论这项协定。土耳其反对党共和人民党的议员缪夫特图格卢、埃吉维特和埃罗格卢等人指出，这个协定同国家的独立和民族尊严是不相容的。
    共和人民党的机关报“民族报”也谴责土—美双边军事协定使美国武装部队有权“干涉土耳其的内政”。
    “国家报”写道，这项协定违背土耳其的宪法和现行的法律。“路线”杂志更进而问道，土耳其民主党的当权者是否打算在必要时把大多数公民关于要求民主党还给他们权利的合法要求说成是“国际共产主义的阴谋”，从而乞求美国的帮助呢？
