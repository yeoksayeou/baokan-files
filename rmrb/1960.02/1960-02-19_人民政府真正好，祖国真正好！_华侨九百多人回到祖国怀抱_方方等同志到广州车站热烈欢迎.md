Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th: More than 900 returned overseas Chinese have returned to the warm embrace of the motherland. They arrived in Hong Kong by ship on the 17th and arrived in Shenzhen by train at noon today. More than 400 of them have already returned to Guangzhou tonight, and the remaining returned overseas Chinese will all return to Guangzhou from Shenzhen on the 19th. When more than 470 returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia arrived in Guangzhou from Shenzhen, Fang Fang, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and member of the Reception and Settlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese, Zhuang Xiquan, Huang Changshui, Deputy Directors of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Zhuang Mingli, Tian Xin, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of Guangdong Province, and Wang Hanjie, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of Fujian Province, and others went to the station to welcome them.

A total of 909 returned overseas Chinese arrived in Shenzhen at noon today. Apart from some who returned from Singapore, Malaya, and other places, 860 returned from Indonesia. Many of their relatives and friends are waiting to board the first batch of ships sent by the motherland to Indonesia to transport overseas Chinese back home. When they arrived in Shenzhen, they were warmly welcomed by Chen Boyuan, Deputy Director of the Guangzhou Office of the Reception and Settlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese, responsible persons of the Overseas Chinese Federation of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City, and people from all walks of life in Bao'an County. When the returned overseas Chinese, supporting the old and carrying the young, crossed the Shenzhen bridgehead, Chen Boyuan and others stepped forward to warmly shake hands with them. Reception staff, customs staff, and border guards enthusiastically helped the returned overseas Chinese take care of the elderly and young and carry luggage. Huang Meihua, 71, who returned from Central Java, Indonesia, had difficulty walking. Reception staff member Huang Shuzhen helped her, and Huang Meihua was moved to tears. She repeatedly cupped her hands and said, "The People's Government is truly good, and the people of the motherland are truly good!"

When the returned overseas Chinese were waiting in the Shenzhen Railway Station lounge to complete entry procedures, the reception staff served them fragrant tea and hot meals. Many returned overseas Chinese held their rice bowls and were too excited to speak. Liao Hong, a returned overseas Chinese from Bangka Island, Indonesia, poured out his experiences to his relatives in the motherland, saying that he had been working as a machine worker on Bangka Island, Indonesia, for 37 years since he went abroad, and he was not adequately fed and clothed despite his year-round toil. He was laid off last October due to old age and weakness. Today, he returned to the motherland alone with two simple pieces of luggage. He said, "Speaking of the past, it's a real flood of tears. Today, I am returning to my roots and finally returning to the motherland. This is my great fortune!"

The motherland cares for the returned overseas Chinese with meticulous care. The reception department has set up a medical station in Shenzhen to provide medical treatment and physical examinations for the returned overseas Chinese.

To facilitate the returned overseas Chinese, entry procedures and quarantine are carried out in the place where the returned overseas Chinese are resting.

More than 290 of these returned overseas Chinese are returned overseas Chinese students who are returning to China to study. The Overseas Chinese Students' Preparatory Schools in Beijing, Guangzhou, and Fujian Jimei, as well as the Fujian Institute of Physical Education, have all sent personnel to Shenzhen to welcome them.

Before returning to China, the overseas Chinese from Indonesia were subjected to various obstacles from the relevant authorities in Indonesia. Their luggage was subjected to rough inspection. Almost none of the more than 200 overseas Chinese students returning from Surabaya brought back their luggage. Sweaters, blankets, instruments, books, and even simple medicines, pillows, and straw mats prepared for the journey were confiscated, so that some returned overseas Chinese students did not have the necessary warm clothes during the journey.

    “人民政府真正好，祖国真正好！”
    华侨九百多人回到祖国怀抱
    方方等同志到广州车站热烈欢迎
    新华社广州18日电　有九百多名归国华侨回到了祖国的温暖怀抱。他们是乘船在17日到达香港的，今天中午乘车到达深圳，其中四百多人已经在今天晚上回到广州，其他归侨将在19日从深圳全部回到广州。四百七十多名印度尼西亚归侨从深圳先行回到广州的时候，华侨事务委员会副主任、接待和安置归国华侨委员会委员方方、庄希泉，华侨事务委员会副主任黄长水、庄明理，广东省华侨事务委员会主任田心，福建省华侨事务委员会主任王汉杰等都到车站欢迎。
    今天中午到达深圳的归国华侨共九百零九人，除了部分是从新加坡、马来亚等地回来的外，有八百六十名是从印度尼西亚归国的，他们的许多亲朋正在等待乘坐祖国第一批派往印度尼西亚接运华侨的船只归国。他们到达深圳的时候，受到接待和安置归国华侨委员会驻广州办公室副主任陈伯源和广东省、广州市华侨联合会负责人以及宝安县各界人民的热烈欢迎。当归侨们扶老携幼跨过深圳桥头的时候，陈伯源等都上前和他们热烈握手，接待人员、海关工作人员和边防军战士都热情地替归侨照顾老幼和搬运行李。从印度尼西亚中爪哇回来的七十一岁的黄梅花，行走不便，接待人员黄淑贞搀扶着她，黄梅花感动得热泪盈眶，她连连拱手说：“人民政府真正好，祖国人民真正好！”
    归侨们在深圳车站休息室等候办理入境手续的时候，接待人员就为他们送上了香茶热饭。许多归侨捧着饭碗，激动得说不出话来。印度尼西亚汶岛归侨廖洪向祖国亲人倾诉他的遭遇说，他在三十七年前出国后，一直在印度尼西亚汶岛作机器工人，终年辛劳不够温饱。去年10月因年老体弱被解雇，今天他带着两件简单行李，孑然一身回到祖国。他说：“提起过去，真是一眶眼泪，今天落叶归根，终于回到祖国，这是我的万幸！”
    祖国无微不至地关怀归国华侨，接待部门在深圳设立了医务站，为归侨看病和检查身体。
    为了方便归侨，入境手续和检疫都在归侨们休息的地方进行。
    这批归国华侨中有二百九十多人是回国升学的归侨学生。北京、广州和福建集美等地的归国华侨学生中等补习学校以及福建体育学院，都派出人员到深圳欢迎他们。
    来自印度尼西亚的华侨在回国之前，受到印度尼西亚有关当局的多方阻挠，他们的行李受到粗暴的检查，泗水回来的两百多名华侨学生，几乎都没有人带回行李，随身带的毛衣、毛毯、仪器、书籍乃至旅途备用的简单药品、枕头、草席等也被扣压，以至有些归国华侨学生在旅途中没有必要的御寒衣服。
