Comprehensive report from our newspaper. According to Soviet press reports, Pandunin, the murderer and traitor who had been hiding for sixteen years and directly participated in the massacre of members of the Krasnodon underground organization of the Soviet Leninist Young Communist League - the "Young Guard," has finally fallen into the net of justice, and was recently sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of the Ukrainian Republic.

During World War II, Pandunin betrayed his country during the German fascist occupation of Krasnodon in the Ukrainian Republic, serving as the deputy director of the local puppet police bureau and working for the German fascists. He organized the search and arrest of patriots and large numbers of underground organization members, and personally interrogated and tortured those arrested. After hiding for a long time, he was finally captured by the Soviet State Security Department last year.

Fadeyev, when writing "The Young Guard," said more than once that the details of many events in the lives of the victims, their experiences, and conversations still had some unclear areas. Now, after the exposure and trial of the fascist lackey Pandunin, the truth of the sacrifice of the Young Guard heroes is clearer.

The traitor who ruined the underground organization of young patriots was Pochipzov. The fascists discovered the trail of the "Young Guard" with Pochipzov's help.

The story is as follows:

The police bureau suspected that Young Guard members Ye. Moshkov, I. Zemnukhov, and Viktor Tretyakevich had stolen the Germans' New Year's gifts and arrested them. Because of a lack of evidence, the police bureau was preparing to release them. Pochipzov was terrified when he heard about their arrest. He decided to inform on them to the German bandits in order to save his own dog's life. This traitor was not a member of the "Young Guard," but he knew of such an organization and had done some things for some of the Young Guard members, because he and many of the members were classmates. After informing, the arrest of Young Guard members began. Materials confessed by the executioner prove that not a single "Young Guard" member showed cowardice or feared death.

There is a hero who was not mentioned in Fadeyev's novel. This is Viktor Tretyakevich, an active organizer of the "Young Guard." According to the resolution of the Standing Committee of the Communist Youth League State Committee, Viktor Tretyakevich stayed in Krasnodon to do youth underground work. The "Young Guard" entrusted Viktor Tretyakevich to lead a combat team. The traitor Pochipzov was the first to point out his name. When Tretyakevich was arrested by the police bureau, the police bureau realized that he had long been the target of Hitler's secret agents.

The fascists cruelly tortured Tretyakevich. When he and the first group of members were taken to Mine No. 5 to be executed, he mustered his last strength to fight the executioners. The executioners were frightened by this fearless young man and, without having time to shoot him, pushed him into a mine shaft eighty meters deep.

The trial of the traitor Pandunin proved that Viktor Tretyakevich was a fearless Communist Youth League member.

Viktor Tretyakevich's deeds have been published in the feature collection "New Deeds of Krasnodon Heroes" published by the "Pravda" Publishing House. This collection also includes new materials about Lyuba Shevtsova and Ivan Turkenich, the commander of the "Young Guard" underground organization. The feature "The Last Days of Lyuba Shevtsova's Life" describes how Lyuba bravely and steadfastly endured all the insults and tortures in the torture chamber of Hitler's secret agents.

Shortly before her execution, she said to her girlfriend:

"Please tell everyone that I love life... In the future, there will be a pure and peaceful azure sky, and our dear Soviet motherland will have the best and most beautiful of everything."

With firm belief in victory and the cause of communism, the heroine bravely went to the execution ground. (Attached picture)

    屠杀苏联“青年近卫军”成员的叛徒

    “青年近卫军”英雄史诗增添光辉
    特列齐雅科维奇的事迹  新近被发现并整理成册
    本报综合报道　据苏联报刊报道，隐藏了十六年之久的、直接参加屠杀苏联列宁共产主义青年团克拉斯诺顿地下组织——
  “青年近卫军”成员的凶手和叛徒潘杜宁终于落入人民法网，并于最近被乌克兰共和国最高法院判处枪决。
    第二次世界大战期间，潘杜宁在德国法西斯占领乌克兰共和国克拉斯诺顿时期背叛祖国，充当了当地伪警察局副局长，为德国法西斯效劳。他曾经组织了搜捕爱国人士和大批地下组织成员的活动，并亲自审讯和拷问被捕者。在长期隐藏以后，去年他终于被苏联国家保安部门捕获。
    法捷耶夫创作“青年近卫军”的时候，不止一次地说过，牺牲者生前许多事件的细节、他们的经历和谈话，仍然有些地方没弄清楚，现在，揭露和审讯法西斯走卒潘杜宁之后，青年近卫军英雄们牺牲的真象更清楚了。
    断送年青爱国者的地下组织的叛徒是波契普佐夫。法西斯分子是在波契普佐夫的帮助下发现了“青年近卫军”的踪迹。
    事情是这样发生的：
    警察局怀疑青年近卫军的队员——叶·莫什科夫，伊·泽姆奴霍夫和维克多·特列齐雅科维奇偷窃德国人的新年礼物，把他们逮捕起来。因为缺少证据，警察局准备释放他们。波契普佐夫听到他们被逮捕的消息，吓坏了。他决定向德寇告密以挽救自己的狗命。这个叛徒不是“青年近卫军”的成员，但是他知道有这样一个组织，并且替青年近卫军某些队员作过一些事情，因为他和许多队员都是同学。告密后，开始逮捕青年近卫军队员。根据刽子手供认的材料证明，没有一个“青年近卫军”队员表现胆怯、贪生怕死。
    有一个英雄在法捷耶夫的小说中没有提到。这就是维克多·特列齐雅科维奇，他是“青年近卫军”的积极组织者。根据共青团州委会常委的决议，维克多·特列齐雅科维奇留在克拉斯诺顿作青年地下组织工作。“青年近卫军”委托维克多·特列齐雅科维奇领导一个战斗小组。叛徒波契普佐夫第一个指出了他的名字。当特列齐雅科维奇被警察局逮捕后，警察局才知道他早已是希特勒特务的追捕对象。
    法西斯分子残酷地拷问特列齐雅科维奇。当他和第一批队员被带到五号矿井处死的时候，他鼓起最后的力量跟刽子手们打起来。刽子手们被这个无畏的青年人吓慌了，没来得及枪决，就把他推到深达八十米的矿井里。
    对叛徒潘杜宁的审讯证明，维克多·特列齐雅科维奇是一位大无畏的共青团员。
    维克多·特列齐雅科维奇的事迹，已经发表在“真理”出版社出版的“克拉斯诺顿英雄的新事”这本特写集中。在这个集子里，还发表了关于柳芭·谢夫卓娃和“青年近卫军”地下组织指挥员伊万·土尔克尼奇的新材料。特写“柳芭·谢夫卓娃生命中的最后几天”，描述了柳芭在希特勒特务的刑讯室里怎样英勇、坚定地承受了一切侮辱和拷打。
    处死前不久，她向自己的女友说：
    “请转告所有的人们，我爱生活……将来一定会出现纯洁与和平的蔚蓝色的天空，我们亲爱的苏维埃祖国，将有最美好、最美好的一切。”
    怀着对胜利、对共产主义事业的坚定信念，女英雄勇敢地走向刑场。（附图片）
