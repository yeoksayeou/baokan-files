Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 11th: A message from Panmunjom: At the 114th meeting of the Military Armistice Commission today, Zhu Changjun, Major General and Senior Member of the Korean-Chinese side of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, strongly protested the US side's illegal transportation of "Nike Hercules" and "Hawk" missiles into South Korea, powerfully exposing and condemning the US side's conspiracy to actively prepare for war in South Korea under the guise of "peace."

    This meeting was held at the suggestion of the Korean-Chinese side.

    Major General Zhu Changjun pointed out at the meeting that, before this, the US side had already illegally transported 280mm atomic cannons, "Honest John" rockets, and "Matador" missiles into South Korea. The Korean-Chinese side has lodged forty-one protests and condemnations against the US side's violation of the armistice agreement, demanding that the US side immediately transport them out of South Korea. However, disregarding the repeated protests from the Korean-Chinese side, the US side has once again seriously violated the armistice agreement by transporting "Nike Hercules" and "Hawk" missiles into South Korea.

    Major General Zhu Changjun demanded that the US side transport the "Nike Hercules" and "Hawk" missiles, as well as all other illegally transported new weapons, out of South Korea, and report the results to the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, guarantee that it will not transport such new weapons in the future, and immediately stop pursuing its sinful war policy in South Korea.

    The US side's senior member, Maddocks, put forward the absurd argument of so-called "aimed at defense" at the meeting to quibble for the US's crime of illegally transporting missiles, and refused the demands of the Korean-Chinese side.

    Major General Zhu Changjun sternly refuted this lie from the US side. Major General Zhu Changjun solemnly pointed out that while transporting the aforementioned new missiles, the US side has also, since the beginning of this year, carried out large-scale so-called "ROK-U.S. joint" military exercises in South Korea in the event of a hypothetical atomic war, and advocated a new war of aggression.

    Major General Zhu Changjun said: "All these actions you are taking now are by no means accidental. Your Commander Magruder and US Secretary of the Army Bruck have openly declared that they will transport more atomic weapons and missiles, as well as US troops, into South Korea. In addition, you are also planning to transport various new missiles such as 'Lacrosse' missiles, as well as the latest jet aircraft and warships, into South Korea. You are arming the US military and the Lee Seung-man puppet army with various new weapons that you have illegally transported into South Korea secretly and openly, trying to further 'modernize' them, and now you are even attempting to reorganize the Lee Seung-man puppet army into 'five-unit atomic divisions.' It is precisely to achieve this goal that you have once again seriously violated the armistice agreement this time by transporting new missiles into South Korea. This shows how actively the US warmongering clique is preparing for war under the guise of shouting 'peace.'"

    Finally, Major General Zhu Changjun solemnly announced to the US representative: "The entire Korean people and the peace-loving people of the world will never allow your conspiracy to launch a war to succeed. We will continue to strictly hold you accountable until you fulfill the tasks assigned to you by the armistice agreement."

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th: The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary today on the Lee Seung-man group's dispatch of two destroyers to Saigon, saying that this is an attempt by US imperialism to escalate tensions in the Far East.

    The commentary said that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has already lodged a protest with the International Supervisory and Control Commission, condemning the Lee Seung-man group's blatant violation of the Geneva Accords, and demanded that immediate measures be taken to ensure that the South Vietnamese authorities abide by the Geneva Accords. The Korean people fully support this demand of the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army and resolutely condemn the US imperialist aggressors who are frantically creating tension in the Far East.

    The commentary said that US imperialism has thoroughly exposed itself as the mastermind behind obstructing the peaceful reunification of countries and escalating the danger of war, not only in Korea but also in Vietnam. The peace-loving people must never allow such criminal acts by the US imperialists.

    美国把导弹武器非法运入南朝鲜
    朝中方面提出强硬抗议
    朝鲜报纸谴责美国加剧战争危险
    新华社平壤11日电　板门店消息：朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员朱昌骏少将今天在军事停战委员会第一百一十四次会议上，强硬抗议美方把“奈克·赫尔克里士”式和“隼”式导弹非法运入南朝鲜，有力地揭露和谴责了美方以“和平”作幌子在南朝鲜积极备战的阴谋活动。
    这次会议是在朝中方面建议下举行的。
    朱昌骏少将在会上指出，在这以前，美方早已把二百八十公厘原子炮、“诚实的约翰”式火箭和“斗牛士”式导弹等武器非法运入了南朝鲜。朝中方面已对美方的这种违反停战协定的行为提出过四十一次抗议和谴责，要求美方立即把它们运出南朝鲜。但是，美方不顾朝中方面的一再抗议，这次又严重违反停战协定，把“奈克·赫尔克里士”式和“隼”式导弹运入了南朝鲜。
    朱昌骏少将要求美方把“奈克·赫尔克里士”式和“隼”式导弹以及其它所有非法运入的新式武器运出南朝鲜去，并将结果报告军事停战委员会和中立国监察委员会，保证以后不再运入此类新式武器，并且立即停止在南朝鲜推行罪恶的战争政策。
    美方首席委员马达克斯在会上提出所谓“目的在于防御”的荒谬论点，来为美国非法运入导弹的罪行诡辩，拒绝朝中方面的要求。
    朱昌骏少将严厉驳斥了美方的这种谎言。朱昌骏少将严正指出，美方在运入上述新式导弹的同时，还从今年年初开始，在南朝鲜接二连三地进行所谓在假想原子战争情况下的大规模的“韩美联合”军事演习，鼓吹新的侵略战争。
    朱昌骏少将说：“你方现在采取的这一切行动绝不是偶然的。你方司令马格鲁德和美国陆军部长布鲁克公然宣称要把更多的原子武器和导弹以及美国军队运入南朝鲜。此外，你方还策划把‘长曲棍球’式导弹等各种新式导弹以及最新式的喷气式飞机和舰艇等运入南朝鲜。你方用秘密地和公开地非法运入南朝鲜的各种新式武器来武装美国军队和李承晚伪军，设法使它们进一步‘现代化’，现在竟又企图把李承晚伪军改编成‘五单位原子师’。你方正是为了达到这种目的，这次又严重违反停战协定，把新的导弹运入南朝鲜。这就表明美国好战集团在叫喊‘和平’的幌子下，正在怎样积极地准备战争。”
    最后，朱昌骏少将郑重向美方代表宣布：“全体朝鲜人民和世界爱好和平的人民决不容许你方这种发动战争的阴谋得逞。我方将继续严格追究你方的责任，直到你方履行停战协定赋予你方的任务时为止。”
    新华社平壤10日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天就李承晚集团派遣两艘驱逐舰去西贡一事发表评论说，这是美帝国主义企图在远东地区加剧紧张局势。
    评论说，越南民主共和国方面已经就此向国际监察和监督委员会提出谴责李承晚集团的这种粗暴违反日内瓦协议的行为，并要求立即采取措施，使南越当局遵守日内瓦协议。朝鲜人民完全支持越南人民军总司令部的这一要求，并且坚决谴责在远东疯狂地制造紧张局势的美帝国主义侵略者。
    评论说，美帝国主义已经彻底地暴露了它不仅是在朝鲜而且也在越南阻挠国家的和平统一、加剧战争危险的主谋者。爱好和平的人民绝不能容许美帝国主义者的这种犯罪行动。
