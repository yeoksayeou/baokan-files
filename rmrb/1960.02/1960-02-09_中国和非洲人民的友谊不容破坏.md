The Friendship Between the Chinese and African People Cannot Be Sabotaged

The Chinese people have always been concerned about and supported the African people's struggle for independence. Now, from North Africa to South Africa, from West Africa to East and Central Africa, the flames of national independence are burning everywhere. The colonial shackles that have bound the African people for centuries are being rapidly shattered. The African people are increasingly taking their destiny into their own hands. The Chinese people feel boundless excitement and joy from the bottom of their hearts for this great change and its glorious prospects on the African continent.

China is a country that has been liberated not long ago, but in order to support the African people, we never hesitate to make whatever efforts we can. We actively supported the Egyptian people's struggle against Anglo-French aggression. We have consistently supported the South African people's struggle against barbaric racial discrimination. We have persistently supported the heroic Algerian people. We regard every struggle of the African people for independence and freedom as our own and strive to support it.

This sincere feeling of the Chinese people towards the African people has a profound basis. China and Africa share a common historical experience and a common destiny. We have both suffered from long-term plunder and oppression by imperialism. Even today, the Chinese people are still fighting for the liberation of Taiwan, the Chinese territory still occupied by US imperialism. The African people and the Chinese people are fighting a common struggle against a common enemy—imperialism—on two battlefronts. The victory of any one of us is support and encouragement for the other.

This relationship of shared fate and mutual concern between our country and the African people is a reliable foundation for establishing friendly and cooperative relations between China and African countries. In recent years, with the development of the anti-imperialist struggle, the friendly and cooperative relations between China and African countries have developed rapidly. China has established diplomatic relations with the United Arab Republic, Morocco, Algeria, Sudan, Guinea, and other countries. Friendly exchanges between the Chinese and African people have become more frequent. The strengthening of this friendly relationship and these exchanges has greatly enhanced our unity and strength in the anti-imperialist struggle and has made important contributions to Asian-African and world peace.

However, imperialism and its running dogs are extremely hostile to the development of friendly relations between China and African countries. They are doing everything possible to undermine this growing friendship. Recently, officials of imperialist countries and their propaganda machines have published a large number of lies designed to sow discord between China and African countries, attempting to confuse the broad masses of African people and the newly independent African countries. The conspiracy of US imperialism is even more insidious. While using new methods to replace Britain and France in their colonial positions in Africa, it is also imposing its consistent "two Chinas" plot on the African people, attempting to use this issue, which the Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate, to provoke the friendly relations between China and African countries, and weaken the friendly unity between the Chinese people and the people of African countries in the anti-imperialist struggle.

Recently, a so-called "Chinese delegation" led by Yang Jizeng, a member of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, visited some West African countries surreptitiously, including Guinea, which had just established diplomatic relations with our country.

The purpose of the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the United States, which manipulates the Chiang Kai-shek clique, in doing so is very clear. They know that in the face of the growing tide of friendly unity between the Chinese people and the African people, it is not easy to achieve their goals by adopting methods of direct sabotage. Therefore, they are attempting to take advantage of the newly independent African countries' desire to be friendly with all countries and the fact that the Chiang Kai-shek clique still illegally occupies our country's seat in the United Nations, to create a relationship between the newly independent African countries and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, so as to create a "two Chinas" situation, or to prevent these countries from establishing and maintaining normal relations with our country at all, and to cut off the ties between the 650 million Chinese people and the 200 million African people and their cooperation. This is an extremely dangerous conspiracy. Therefore, we believe it is necessary to further explain the issue of the so-called "two Chinas" created by the United States to our African friends:

The Government of the People's Republic of China is the only legal government of the Chinese people. The reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek clique on the Chinese mainland has long been overthrown by the Chinese people. Its remnants are only a small group of puppets under the protection of American bayonets. It is not a country at all, and it has absolutely no right to represent China. In any international relations, the Chinese people and the Chinese government will never allow a "two Chinas" situation to occur. We firmly believe that the African people, who are striving for and safeguarding their own independence, support our solemn position.

Some believe that since the Chiang Kai-shek clique is recognized by the United Nations, its nominal or legal representation cannot be denied. This statement is obviously wrong. The Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique under the protection of American bayonets still occupies the seat of the 650 million Chinese people in the United Nations. This is the result of illegal manipulation by the United States. This is the most disgraceful thing in the United Nations and has long been condemned by all fair-minded people in the world. Today, all countries friendly to our country demand that the United Nations expel the Chiang Kai-shek clique and restore the legitimate status and rights of the Chinese people. This powerfully reflects the firm will of the people of all countries. They will never recognize any nominal or legal so-called "representation" of the puppets created by imperialism.

Some attempt to confuse the issue of the so-called "two Chinas" with the two Germanys, two Koreas, and two Vietnams. This confusing statement is also completely untenable. Everyone knows that the existence of two Germanys is the result of World War II, and the temporary division of two Koreas and two Vietnams is stipulated by relevant international agreements. Contrary to these situations, the Taiwan issue is not an unresolved international issue left over from World War II. Taiwan has been Chinese territory since ancient times. After World War II, Taiwan, which was occupied by Japanese imperialism, has been returned to China in accordance with international agreements. The issue of liberating Taiwan is entirely China's internal affair.

Bringing out specious arguments such as the United Nations and the two Germanys to confuse the major issues of right and wrong on the Taiwan issue is entirely a component of the imperialist conspiracy of the United States to interfere in China's internal affairs, occupy China's territory Taiwan, and create "two Chinas". We hope that all friendly African countries understand the solemn position of the People's China on the "two Chinas" issue and do not fall into the trap of the US and Chiang Kai-shek's sabotage of the friendship between the Chinese and African people.

### 中国和非洲人民的友谊不容破坏

    中国和非洲人民的友谊不容破坏
    中国人民一向关心和支持非洲人民的独立斗争。现在，从北非到南非，从西非到东非、中非，民族独立的烽火在遍地燃烧，套在非洲人民身上几个世纪的殖民枷锁正在迅速地被粉碎，非洲人民日益掌握了自己的命运，非洲正以其巨人的步伐跨进了二十世纪六十年代。中国人民对非洲大陆这一伟大的变化，及其光辉灿烂的前景，从内心深处感到无限的兴奋和欢快。
    中国是一个解放不久的国家，但是为了支援非洲人民，我们从不吝惜作出我们可能作出的努力。我们积极声援埃及人民反对英法侵略的斗争。我们一贯支持南非人民反对野蛮的种族歧视的斗争。我们坚持不懈地支援英勇战斗的阿尔及利亚人民。我们把非洲人民每一个争取独立自由的斗争看成是自己的斗争，并竭力予以支持。
    中国人民对非洲人民这种真挚的感情是有深厚基础的。中国和非洲具有共同的历史遭遇和共同的命运。我们都曾经受过帝国主义的长期掠夺和压迫。即便是今天，中国人民也还在为解放仍被美帝国主义霸占的中国领土台湾而进行着斗争。非洲人民和中国人民是在两条战线上向着共同的敌人——帝国主义进行着共同的斗争。我们当中任何一方的胜利都是对另一方的支持和鼓舞。
    我国和非洲人民之间这种休戚相关，忧乐与共的关系，是我国和非洲国家之间建立友好合作关系的可靠基础。近年来，随着反帝斗争形势的发展，中国和非洲国家之间的友好合作关系得到了迅速的发展。中国已经同阿联、摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚、苏丹、几内亚等国建立了外交关系。中国和非洲人民之间的友好来往更为频繁。这种友好关系和来往的加强，大大增进了我们在反帝斗争中的团结和力量，并且为亚非和世界和平作出了重要的贡献。
    但是，帝国主义及其走狗对中国和非洲国家之间友好关系的发展是极端仇视的。他们正在千方百计的从中破坏这种日益发展的友好关系。最近，帝国主义国家的官员和他们的宣传机器，发表了挑拨中国和非洲国家关系的大量谎言，企图迷惑广大的非洲人民和新近取得独立的非洲国家。美帝国主义的阴谋更加恶毒，它在用新的手法取英法在非洲殖民地位而代之的同时，又把它一贯推行的“两个中国”的阴谋强加在非洲人民头上，企图用这个中国人民绝对不能容忍的问题，来挑拨中国和非洲国家的友好关系，削弱中国人民和非洲各国人民在反帝斗争中的友好团结。
    最近，一个以蒋介石集团分子杨继曾率领的所谓“中国代表团”鬼鬼祟祟地访问了西非一些国家，其中包括刚同我国建立了外交关系的几内亚。
    蒋介石集团和操纵蒋介石集团的美国这样做的目的是很清楚的。他们知道，在中国人民和非洲人民日益友好团结的潮流前面，采取正面破坏的办法是不大容易达到目的的。因此，他们就企图利用新近独立的非洲国家希望和一切国家友好的愿望和蒋介石集团还非法窃踞我国在联合国的席位的事实，使新近独立的非洲国家和蒋介石集团发生关系，好这样来制造“两个中国”的局面，或者使这些国家根本不能同我国建立和保持正常关系，杜绝六亿五千万中国人民和二亿非洲人民的联系和合作。这是一个极其危险的阴谋。因此，我们认为有必要就美国制造的所谓“两个中国”的问题，向非洲的朋友们作进一步的说明：
    中华人民共和国政府是中国人民唯一合法的政府，蒋介石集团在中国大陆的反动统治早已被中国人民所推翻，它的残余分子只是一小撮在美国刺刀保护下的傀儡，根本不是一个什么国家，更绝对无权代表中国。在任何国际关系中，中国人民和中国政府绝不容“两个中国”的局面出现。我们深信，正在争取和维护自己的独立的非洲人民是支持我们这一严正立场的。
    有人认为，蒋介石集团既然得到联合国的承认，因此还不能否认它在名义上和法律上的代表性，这种讲法显然是错误的。在美国刺刀保护下的台湾蒋介石集团至今在联合国中窃踞六亿五千万中国人民的席位，是美国非法操纵的结果，这是联合国最不光采的事情，早已遭到了全世界一切公正人士的谴责。今天所有同我国友好的国家，都要求联合国驱逐蒋介石集团，恢复中国人民的合法地位和权利。这有力地反映了各国人民的坚决意志，他们决不承认帝国主义所制造出来的傀儡有任何名义上和法律上的所谓“代表性”。
    有人企图把所谓“两个中国”的问题同两个德国、两个朝鲜和两个越南混为一谈。这种混淆是非的说法也是完全经不起一驳的。大家都知道，两个德国的存在是第二次世界大战的结果造成的，两个朝鲜和两个越南的暂时分立是有关的国际协定规定了的。同这些情况相反，台湾问题不属于第二次世界大战遗留下来的未解决的国际问题，台湾自古以来就是中国的领土，在第二次世界大战后，被日本帝国主义所侵占的台湾已根据国际协定归还了中国。解放台湾问题完全是中国的内政问题。
    搬出联合国和两个德国等似是而非的论据来混淆台湾问题上的大是大非，完全是美国借以干涉中国内政、侵占中国领土台湾和制造“两个中国”的帝国主义阴谋的一个组成部分。我们希望一切非洲友好国家了解人民中国在“两个中国”问题上的严正立场，不要陷入美、蒋破坏中国和非洲人民友谊的圈套。
