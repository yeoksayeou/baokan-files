    Intensify Mating and Delivery, Carefully Manage Nursing
    Inner Mongolia Strives for a Net Increase of 10% in Large Livestock
    Guangfeng, Jiangxi Achieves Full Mating, Accuracy, Birth, Survival, and Robustness of Cattle for Two Consecutive Years

    (Reported by our newspaper) The people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia are striving for a net increase of 10% in large livestock this year. Currently, the grasslands and pastures of the autonomous region are in the season of early spring calving for large livestock. The region has now delivered more than 116,000 calves, foals, camel foals, and small mules and donkeys. The survival rate of young livestock on the Xilin Gol, Ulanqab, and Bayannur grasslands has reached over 95%.

    Since last winter, the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" campaign launched in Inner Mongolia has effectively strengthened the feeding and management of large livestock and the prevention and treatment of livestock diseases. Last year, people's communes throughout the region built more than 280,000 livestock sheds (rooms), and pregnant and weak livestock were housed in warm sheds. The people's communes on the Ordos grassland, based on the easy occurrence of livestock epidemics in previous springs, mobilized herdsmen to learn epidemic treatment last winter and organized medicine to go to the grassland. At the same time, the communes established strict livestock hygiene and epidemic prevention systems, combining grazing herdsmen, delivery and conservation personnel, and veterinary epidemic prevention personnel, conducting a general survey of the herds every three days. If an epidemic is discovered, it is immediately isolated or blocked for on-site eradication. Therefore, the mortality rate of livestock due to disease in the region has decreased by more than two-thirds compared to the same period last year.

    Due to the people's communes focusing on the mating of large livestock, 1,540,000 out of the region's 1,690,000 large livestock mothers have become pregnant, accounting for 85% of the breeding-age mothers. Among them, more than 320,000 mothers were bred using artificial insemination. Now, the peak season for calving of large livestock in the autonomous region is approaching, and more than 1.3 million pregnant mothers will deliver successively.

  In order to ensure a net increase of 10% in large livestock this year, the people's communes in various parts of the autonomous region are also increasing the purchase of sesame oil, brick tea, sesame cakes, salt, etc., to continue to strengthen the spring feeding and management of large livestock. More than 40,000 veterinary personnel distributed on the grasslands and pastures, carrying medicines, have penetrated into the spring pastures. The staff of more than 1,500 large livestock breeding stations and more than 1,000 insemination points throughout the region are now prepared to welcome the spring mating of large livestock.

    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, February 28th. Guangfeng County, Jiangxi Province, a red banner county in cattle raising, is focusing on the spring mating of cattle. Now, all 2,016 cows in the county that should have been mated in January and February have been fully mated and are pregnant. The breeders of each commune have strengthened the feeding and care of pregnant cows, and have generally implemented the "four clean" and "six diligent" feeding methods of clean feed, clean cattle pen, clean cattle body, clean utensils, and diligent grazing, diligent feeding in small amounts, diligent bedding and manure removal, diligent inspection, diligent drinking water, and diligent grooming, striving to prevent miscarriage in cows.

    Guangfeng County is a red flag in the high-speed development of cattle in Jiangxi Province. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, this county has achieved "five fulls" in cattle raising for two consecutive years, namely full mating, full accuracy, full birth, full survival, and full robustness. By the end of last year, the number of cattle raised in the county had increased to 40,856. The cultivated land area burdened by each head of cattle has decreased from 60 mu in 1949 to 14 mu. Due to the large increase in the number of cattle, the needs of deep plowing and fine cultivation have been strongly supported, and the average yield per mu of grain in this county has exceeded 1,000 jin for two consecutive years.

    The important link in developing cattle is to focus on mating work. Before the arrival of the spring mating season this year, the Guangfeng County Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed the 247 cattle breeding stations in various communes and brigades to strengthen mating preparations. The county committee also designated a secretary to focus on cattle mating work. To facilitate leadership, the county was divided into eight cattle breeding areas, with a member of the county committee standing committee specifically responsible for each area, and a county committee member working here in each commune to take care of this work. The production teams of each commune also have a secretary or captain leading the spring mating of cattle. At the same time, the county committee also conducted extensive ideological mobilization work throughout the county through telephone conferences, on-site meetings, etc., and organized communes to compete with communes, teams to compete with teams, groups to compete with groups, and breeders to compete with breeders in the cattle mating red flag competition.

  In order to ensure that breeding-age cows are mated in a timely manner during the spring mating season, all communes in the county have registered and labeled cows with reproductive capacity, and indicated the estrus period, the time when mating should be done, and the appropriate breeding bulls for each cow. This allows breeders to accurately grasp the mating period of each cow, and as soon as a cow is found to be in heat, they quickly take the cow to the breeding station for mating within one day after estrus. For cows with weak reproductive capacity, unclear estrus, older age, or those who have slightly missed the estrus period, the "double mating method" of mating twice a day is generally used. For cows that have just given birth to calves, refined feeds such as salt, fine bran, and rice straw are added to make them fat and strong, and to promote early estrus; for cows with slower estrus, mating is carried out before estrus to make them estrus early, so that they can be mated in a timely manner. In this way, all the cows in the county that should be mated have become pregnant.

    In order to encourage the enthusiasm of breeders for breeding cattle, the communes have also reasonably stipulated the remuneration for raising calves on the basis of strengthening political and ideological work among the breeders. According to regulations, a certain amount of material reward is given to the breeder for each calf born. Additional remuneration is given if the calf does not die within one year after birth. The breeding bull is also given appropriate remuneration to the breeder for each calf mated. This spring, more than 2,000 cows in the county that should have been mated were actively taken to the breeding station for mating by the breeders, eliminating the phenomenon of empty pregnancy. Feed the cattle well to welcome the spring plowing. (Attached picture)

    抓紧配种接产　精心护养管理
    内蒙古力争大家畜纯增10％
    江西广丰连续两年实现耕牛全配全准全生全活全壮
    本报讯　内蒙古各族农牧民，力争今年大家畜纯增10％。目前，自治区各草原牧场上，正是大家畜生产早春仔的季节，全区现在已接产十一万六千多头牛犊、马驹、驼羔和小骡、小驴。锡林郭勒、乌兰察布和巴彦淖尔草原上大家畜的幼畜成活率达到95％以上。
    去年冬季以来，内蒙古掀起的“百母百仔”运动，有效地加强了大家畜的饲养管理和牲畜疫病防治工作。去年各人民公社新建了二十八万多座（间）牲畜棚圈，大家畜的怀胎母畜和老弱畜，都住上了暖棚暖圈。鄂尔多斯草原上的各人民公社，还根据往年春季容易发生畜疫情况，从去年冬季就发动牧工学习疫病治疗，并且组织药品上草原。同时，各公社建立了严格的牲畜卫生防疫制度，放牧饲养员、接产保育和兽医防疫员三结合，每三天普查一次畜群，发现疫情，立即进行隔离或封锁，以便就地扑灭，因此全区牲畜的因病死亡率，比去年同期减少了三分之二以上。
    由于人民公社大抓特抓大家畜的配种工作，全区一百六十九万头大家畜母畜中，已有一百五十四万头怀孕，占适龄母畜的85％，其中有三十二万多头母畜，是采用人工授精方法配种的。现在，自治区大牲畜集中产仔季节快要到了，全区有一百三十多万头怀胎母畜，将陆续产仔。
  为了保证今年大家畜纯增10％，目前自治区各地人民公社还增购麻油、砖茶、麻饼、食盐等，继续加强大牲畜的春季饲养管理。分布在草原牧场上的四万多名兽医人员，携带药品深入春季牧场，全区一千五百多个大家畜配种站和一千多个输精点的工作人员，现在都做好准备，迎接大家畜的春季配种工作。
    新华社南昌28日电　江西省养牛红旗县——广丰县大抓耕牛春季配种工作。现在全县应该在1、2两月配种的二千零一十六头母牛，已经全配满怀。各公社的饲养员，对怀胎母牛都加强了饲养护理，普遍实行了饲料净、牛栏净、牛身净、用具净和勤放牧、勤添少喂、勤垫栏出粪、勤检查、勤饮水、勤梳刷的“四净”“六勤”饲养方法，力争母牛不流产。
    广丰县是江西省高速度发展耕牛的一面红旗。这个县从1958年大跃进以来，连续两年实现了养牛“五全”，即全配、全准、全生、全活、全壮。到去年年底，全县养牛头数已经发展到四万零八百五十六头。平均每头耕牛负担的耕地面积已由1949年的六十亩减少到十四亩。由于耕牛数量大增，有力地支援了深耕细作的需要，这个县已经连续两年粮食平均亩产量超过千斤。
    发展耕牛的重要环节，是狠抓配种工作，在今年春配季节到来之前，中共广丰县委就指示各公社和各大队的二百四十七个耕牛配种站，加强配种准备。县委还指定一名书记专抓耕牛配种工作。为了便于领导，全县划分为八个耕牛繁殖片，每个片有一名县委常委专门负责，每个公社也有一名分工在这里工作的县委委员抓这一工作。各公社的生产队也都有一个书记或队长领导耕牛春配。同时，县委又及时通过电话会、现场会等形式，在全县进行了广泛的思想动员工作，并且组织公社与公社、队与队、组与组、饲养员与饲养员开展了耕牛配种红旗竞赛。
  为了保证适龄母牛在春配季节适时配种，全县各公社都对有繁殖能力的母牛进行登记挂牌，并标明了每头母牛的发情期、应该配种的时间和合适的种公牛。这样就使饲养员准确的掌握了每头母牛的配种期，一发现母牛发情，就抓紧在发情后一天内牵母牛到配种站配种。对于繁殖能力较弱、发情不很明显、年龄较大的母牛，或者稍误发情期的母牛，普遍采用了一天配种两次的“双重配种法”。对刚生过小牛不久的母牛，增喂食盐、细糠、稻草等精饲料，促使它膘肥体壮，提早发情；对发情较慢的母牛，在它发情前就进行交配，使它提早发情，以便适时配种。这样，就使全县应该配种的母牛，达到了头头受胎。
    为了鼓励饲养员繁殖耕牛的积极性，各公社在对饲养人员加强政治思想工作的基础上，还合理地规定了养小牛的报酬。按规定，每生一头小牛，即给饲养员一定的实物奖励。小牛出生后一年之内不死亡还另给报酬。对种公牛也规定每配上一头小牛给饲养员以适当的报酬。今春这个县应该配种二千多头母牛，都由饲养员主动地牵到配种站进行配种，消灭了空怀现象。喂好耕牛迎春耕。（附图片）
