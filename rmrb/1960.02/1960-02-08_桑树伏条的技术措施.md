Technical Measures for Mulberry Tree Layering

    Now is a favorable time for mulberry tree layering, and it must be completed before the end of February. In terms of technical operations, the five measures of "selection, layering, harvesting, thinning, and management" must be specifically implemented:

    I. Selection: Choose space for layering. Densely planted mulberry gardens should make full use of the "four sides and one space" (riverside, pond side, house side, roadside, and space within the mulberry garden) for layering, ensuring that layering is done wherever there is a side, and layering is done wherever there is space, with more layering in large spaces and less layering in small spaces. Sparsely planted mulberry gardens and scattered mulberry trees with large surrounding spaces should be layered comprehensively. Choose mulberry branches that are free from pests and diseases, undamaged, robust in growth, and more than two chi (尺, a Chinese unit of length, approx. 1/3 meter) long for layering; avoid layering small, weak branches and overly short branches.

    II. Layering: Layer flat, layer evenly, and layer firmly to ensure the quality of layering. According to the size of the space around the mulberry tree, gently pull the selected branches down smoothly, tie one end of a rice straw rope to the middle of the branch, and tie the other end to the main trunk of the mulberry tree or a nearby mulberry tree. Alternatively, tie the branches of two mulberry trees together. The branches should be tied flat, in a "one" shape, and not layered into an arched or sloping shape. The layered mulberry branches should be distributed evenly so that they can receive full sunlight, and two branches should not be put together to avoid affecting the germination rate of the branches and the yield of mulberry leaves. Operate carefully and lightly tie the branches to prevent breaking them and damaging the leaf buds.

    III. Harvesting: The purpose of layering is to increase the number of branches and improve the yield, laying the foundation for doubling the production of mulberry leaves in the future. Therefore, during the spring silkworm season, only harvest leaf pieces and tender shoots (新梢), and do not cut the well-layered old branches. When harvesting leaves, strictly prevent grasping and pulling all the leaves at once to avoid damaging the bark and axillary buds. Cut the tender shoots half a cun (寸, a Chinese unit of length, approx. 1/30 meter) away from the old branches, and cut off excessively long branch tips on the old branches according to the location of the space to promote early germination and more new shoots.

    IV. Thinning: When the new shoots grow to five or six cun, thin the buds when raising summer silkworms. According to the growth of the branches, generally retain three to five new branches on each old branch, distributing them evenly, keeping the strong and removing the weak, to achieve the goal of retaining ten thousand branches per mu (亩, a Chinese unit of area, approx. 1/6 acre).

    V. Management: After mulberry tree layering, the cultivation and management of the mulberry garden must be closely followed to maximize the yield increase. On the basis of fully completing winter plowing, fertilization, pruning, and whitewashing in the mulberry garden, it is required to apply fifty dan (担, a Chinese unit of weight, approx. 50 kg) of standard fertilizer per mu for spring fertilizer and one hundred dan for summer fertilizer, applied in two installments; ensure that weeds are removed as soon as they are seen, and there are no weeds in the mulberry field; effectively strengthen pest control, adopt a combination of manual capture and chemical (2000 times dilution of Dipterex) prevention and control to kill mulberry leaf insects, mulberry caterpillars, and mulberry inchworms; and take measures such as smoking to prevent frost damage.

    桑树伏条的技术措施
    目前正是桑树伏条的有利时机，必须争取在2月底以前完成。在技术操作上，要具体贯彻执行“选、伏、采、疏、管”五项措施：
    一、选：选择空间伏条。成片的密植桑园要充分利用“四边一空”（河边、塘边、宅边、路边及桑园的空间）伏条，做到有边必伏，见空就伏，空隙大多伏，空隙小少伏。稀植桑园及零星桑树，四周空隙大，要全面伏条。要选择没有病虫害，没有受到损伤，生长粗壮，条长在二尺以上的桑条伏条；细小弱枝及过短枝条不伏。
    二、伏：要伏得平、伏得匀、伏得牢，保证伏条质量。根据桑树四周空隙的大小，将选定的枝条顺势轻轻向下拉平，用稻草绳一端缚在枝条的中间，另一端缚在桑树的主干上或邻近的桑树上，也可以将两株桑树上的枝条相连缚牢。枝条要根根缚平，成“一”字形，不要伏成弓形或斜坡形。伏条的桑枝要条条分布均匀，使它能受到阳光的充分照射，不能把两根枝条并在一起，以免影响桑枝发芽率和桑叶产量。操作时要小心轻缚，防止折断枝条和损伤叶芽。
    三、采：伏条的目的是增加条数，提高产量，为今后桑叶成倍地增产打下基础。所以，春蚕期只采片叶和蕻头（新梢），不要剪伏好的老条。采叶时要严防一把捋，以免损伤皮部和腋芽。蕻头离开老条半寸进行剪伐，并根据空间的位置，剪去老条过长的条梢，促使提早发芽，多发新梢。
    四、疏：新梢长到五、六寸，在养夏蚕时，进行疏芽。根据枝条的生长情况，一般每根老条上留养三、五个新枝条，使分布均匀，留强去弱，达到亩亩留养万根条。
    五、管：桑树伏条后，桑园的培育管理工作必须紧紧跟上，才能发挥最大的增产效果。桑园在全面完成冬耕、施肥、整枝、白化的基础上，要求亩亩施足春肥五十担标准肥，夏肥一百担，分二次施用；做到见草就削，桑地不见草；切实加强治虫工作，采取人工捕捉和药剂（二千倍的敌百虫）防治相结合的办法，捕杀桑叶虫、桑毛虫、桑尺蠖；并采取熏烟等办法，预防霜冻为害。
