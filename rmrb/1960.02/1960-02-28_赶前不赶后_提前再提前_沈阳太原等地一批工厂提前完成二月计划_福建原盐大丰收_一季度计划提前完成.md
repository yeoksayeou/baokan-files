Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 26th: By the 22nd, 160 factories and enterprises in Shenyang City had overfulfilled their February production plans ahead of schedule. On the afternoon of the 24th, the city held a victory reporting and skills competition, and the workers of each factory resolved to further set off a climax of technological innovation and strive to complete the first quarter production plan ahead of schedule.

    Due to the in-depth development of the technological innovation movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization in the factories and enterprises of this city, the working conditions of workers have been improved, and the efficiency of production has been greatly improved, which has greatly promoted the development of production and ensured the early completion of the February production plan. Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory broke through the weak links in production in the mass technical innovation movement, and also completed the February production task in an all-round way seven days ahead of schedule. The output value completed 100.6% of the monthly plan, an increase of 14% compared with the same period last month, the output completed 102%, the labor productivity completed 100.6%, and the cost decreased by 1% compared with January.

    At the city-wide factory and enterprise victory reporting and skills competition held on the afternoon of the 24th, many factories and enterprises that had completed their February plans ahead of schedule put forward new goals and resolved to complete the first quarter plan ahead of schedule. They used this as a condition and put forward a friendly competition with brother factories and enterprises in the city.

    This newspaper reports that, according to Xinhua News Agency reports, Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, Taihang Instrument Plant, Taiyuan Boiler Plant and Quartz Plant in Taiyuan City, Jinan First and Second Machine Tool Plants in Jinan City, and Chongqing Radio Factory have all completed their February plans ahead of schedule, and all completed indicators are higher than those in January.

    In completing the February production plan, these factories have actively carried out mass movements for technological innovation and technological revolution. For example, with the support of the Taiyuan Institute of Technology, the workers of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant quickly built two mechanized assembly lines, making 14 machine tools realize single-machine automation and semi-automation, and promoted many new technologies in smelting, forging and other processes. Therefore, 15 technical and economic indicators such as steel ingot utilization coefficient and steel utilization coefficient of the whole plant have reached advanced levels respectively. As early as the end of January, the Party committee of the First and Second Machine Tool Plants in Jinan City fully mobilized the masses to discuss plans, arrange production keys, study and formulate measures by explaining the situation and setting tasks, and implemented the plans to workshops, sections, teams, machine tools, and individuals. Under the leadership of the Party, the workers of the whole plant pushed the technological innovation and technological revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization to a new peak. In the first 20 days of February, they realized 472 innovation proposals, which increased work efficiency by one to six hundred times respectively.

    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 27th: As of February 15th, the crude salt production in Fujian Province totaled more than 72,500 tons, exceeding the first quarter salt production plan by 46 days ahead of schedule, an increase of 1.14 times compared with the bumper harvest in the same period in 1959, and the average daily output increased by 23% compared with December last year.

    This year, salt farms in various parts of Fujian Province began to repair equipment and store brine while producing at the end of last year. Salt workers at Putian Salt Farm expanded the brine protection wells and brine protection ditches by more than 80,000 cubic meters in half a month, and added more than 1.8 million cubic meters of seawater, which prepared conditions for a large amount of salt production. The mass movement of increasing crude salt production in various salt farms has rapidly and vigorously unfolded, and the climate is better than in previous years, so salt production has shown a good situation of rising steadily at the beginning of this year. Now, the salt farms are continuing to vigorously carry out technological innovation and technological revolution, grasping the current production with one hand and the preparation for the next step with the other, and are determined to achieve a monthly red in salt production.

    赶前不赶后　提前再提前
    沈阳太原等地一批工厂提前完成二月计划
    福建原盐大丰收　一季度计划提前完成
    据新华社沈阳26日电　沈阳市到22日止，已有一百六十个工厂企业提前超额完成了2月份生产计划。24日下午，全市举行了报捷比武大会，各厂职工决心进一步掀起技术革新高潮，争取提前完成今年第一季度生产计划。
    这个市的工厂企业由于深入开展了以机械化半机械化为中心的技术革新运动，改善了工人劳动条件，提高了生产效率，大大促进了生产的发展，保证了2月份生产计划的提前完成。沈阳高压开关厂在群众性技术革新运动中，突破了生产薄弱环节，也提前七天全面完成了2月份生产任务，产值完成了月计划的100．6％，比上月同期增长了14％，产量完成102％，劳动生产率完成100．6％，成本比1月份下降1％。
    在24日下午召开的全市工厂企业报捷比武大会上，许多提前完成2月份计划的工厂企业，纷纷提出了新的奋斗目标，决心提前完成第一季度计划。他们以此作为条件，向全市兄弟工厂企业提出了友谊比武竞赛。
    本报讯　据新华社报道：太原市太原矿山机械厂、太行仪表厂、太原锅炉厂和石英厂，济南市第一、第二机床厂，以及重庆无线电厂都已提前完成2月份计划，完成的各种指标都比1月份的高。
    这些工厂在完成2月份生产计划中，都积极开展了技术革新和技术革命的群众运动。如太原矿山机械厂职工在太原工学院的支援下，迅速建成了两条机械化流水作业线，使十四台机床实现了单机自动化、半自动化，并且在冶炼、锻造等工序上推广了许多新技术。因此，全厂钢锭利用系数、钢材利用系数等十五项技术经济指标都分别达到了先进水平。济南第一、第二机床厂早在1月底，工厂党委就通过讲形势，摆任务，充分发动群众讨论计划，排生产关键，研究和制订措施，并且把计划落实到车间、工段、班组、机床和个人。全厂职工在党的领导下，把以机械化半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动推向新的高峰，在2月的前二十天就实现革新建议四百七十二件，分别提高工效一倍到六百倍。
    据新华社福州27日电　福建省原盐生产到2月15日止，共产盐七万二千五百多吨，提前四十六天超额完成第一季度产盐计划，比大丰收的1959年同期增长一点一四倍，平均日产量比去年12月份增长23％。
    今年，福建省各地盐场在去年底就一边生产，一边开始整修设备和储备卤水，莆田盐场盐工在半个月内扩大了保卤井和保卤沟八万多立方米，纳进了一百八十多万立方米的海水，为大量产盐准备了条件。各地盐场增产原盐的群众运动迅速猛烈地展开，气候又比往年好，所以盐业生产在今年一开始就出现了节节上升的大好局面。现在，各盐场正在继续大搞技术革新和技术革命，一手抓紧当前生产，一手抓下一步的准备工作，决心作到盐业生产月月红。
