　　"Pig manure and red clover, two treasures for farmers" -- this is a folk song from the South. From this, it can be seen that farmers in the South have always regarded pig manure and green manure as equal. Currently, rice-producing areas in the South are strengthening the field management of green manure to obtain more high-quality fertilizer from green manure fields and realize high-yield rice plans. However, one issue deserves attention: In the past, some areas treated rapeseed as green manure, plowing the rapeseed into the fields as fertilizer during spring planting. This practice is not good and needs to be changed.

　　Plowing rapeseed into the fields as fertilizer is neither a scientific nor an economical practice. Although rapeseed contains a certain amount of oil, the fertilizer effect of oil is very low and harmful to soil and plants. This is unscientific. It is even more obvious that it is uneconomical: is it more worthwhile to use overwintering rapeseed as fertilizer, or to strengthen management to strive for high-yield rapeseed? Of course, it is the latter. This can not only increase the production of edible oil, but also use oil cake as fertilizer, and the fertilizer effect of oil cake is very high.

　　Rapeseed is one of China's main oil crops. Last year, winter rapeseed overfulfilled the planting plan. After overwintering management, rapeseed is currently growing well in many areas. We must change the habit of treating rapeseed as green manure and strive to plant one mu, manage one mu, and harvest one mu!

### 绿肥和油菜

    绿肥和油菜
    “猪榭红花草，农家两个宝”——这是南方的一句民谣。从这里可以看出，南方的农民一向是把猪粪和绿肥同等看待的。目前南方水稻产区正在加强绿肥田间管理，争取从绿肥田中得到更多的优质肥料，实现水稻高产计划。但是，有一个问题值得注意：过去有些地区把油菜当作绿肥，春播时把油菜翻到地里作肥料。这种作法不好，需要改变。
    把油菜翻到地里作肥料，是一个既不科学又不经济的做法。油菜籽虽然含有一定的油分，但油脂的肥效却很低，并有害于土壤和植物。这是不科学。说它不经济，道理更明显：是把越冬的油菜做肥料合算，还是加强管理争取油菜高产合算？当然是后者、这样不但可以增产食油，也可以利用油饼做肥料，而且油饼的肥效很高。
    油菜是我国主要的油料作物之一。去年冬油菜超额完成了播种计划，经过越冬管理，目前许多地区油菜生长很好。我们一定要改变把油菜当作绿肥的习惯，力争种一亩、管一亩、收一亩！
