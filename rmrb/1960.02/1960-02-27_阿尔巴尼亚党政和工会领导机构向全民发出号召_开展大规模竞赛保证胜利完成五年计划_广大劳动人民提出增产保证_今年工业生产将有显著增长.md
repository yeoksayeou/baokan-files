Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, February 26th: The Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, the Council of Ministers, the National Committee of the Democratic Front, and the Central Council of Trade Unions jointly issued a resolution on the 25th, calling on workers, agricultural cooperative members, and people's intellectuals nationwide to launch a new and large-scale socialist competition movement to victoriously complete the Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960).

    The resolution pointed out that the purpose of carrying out the socialist competition is not only to complete the total value of production, but also to improve product quality as soon as possible, practice strict economy, strengthen discipline, and consolidate agricultural cooperatives organizationally and economically.

    Enterprises and cities that win the competition will receive the Red Banner of Excellence and certificates of merit. In order to lead this work, government ministries, mass organizations, and relevant central agencies will form a Central Committee for Socialist Competition.

    This year is the last year of Albania's Second Five-Year Plan. Since the beginning of the new year, workers, staff, and the broad masses of farmers have actively launched a production increase movement and have successively submitted production increase guarantees to the Central Committee of the Labor Party. All employees of the Pishkash ferronickel mine guaranteed to complete the Second Five-Year Plan three months ahead of schedule, and decided to complete the 1960 production plan with a 103% performance and overproduce 7,350 tons of ferronickel ore for the state. Employees of the Lushnjë December 29th State Farm proposed to increase the yield per unit area of ​​corn and cotton, and to complete the 1960 grain delivery task with a 100.77% performance. The entire working people of the Korçë District issued a friendly challenge to all districts in the country, guaranteeing to overfulfill the industrial and agricultural production of 1960 and set specific guarantees. The friendly challenge of the working people in the Korçë District quickly received a response from factories and mines across the country, and they successively put forward the conditions for accepting the challenge and set higher targets.

    This newspaper reports that this year, the production of Albania's various industrial sectors will grow rapidly. This year's industrial output will reach 24.7 times that of the pre-war year of 1938. That is to say, the output in less than fourteen days this year will be equivalent to the entire year's output in 1938.

    The Second Five-Year Plan will be completed this year. According to the regulations of the February 1959 plenary session of the Albanian Labor Party, this year's industrial output will increase by 11% compared to last year. Production in several industrial sectors will increase significantly. Oil will increase by 18%; chromium ore by 17%; ferronickel ore by 47%; the power industry by 17%; the building materials industry by 38%; the food industry by 15%; and the machinery and metal smelting industry by 18%.

    Compared with 1959, the labor productivity of the industrial sector will increase by 12%.

    This newspaper reports that Albania's mining industry has achieved tremendous development. Copper production in 1959 increased by more than thirteen times compared to 1946. The output of blister copper exceeded the task set by the Third Congress of the Albanian Labor Party for the first four years of the Second Five-Year Plan by 35%, and also exceeded the task set by the February 1958 plenary session for the same period by 12%. The copper mined in these four years has increased by three and a half times compared to the copper mined in the first four years of the First Five-Year Plan.

    The face of Albania's chromium ore has undergone unimaginable changes. The chromium ore industry has greatly developed in the past few years of the Second Five-Year Plan. It completed 103% of the expanded mining plan (1956-1959).

    This year, chromium production will continue to increase. Compared with 1938, this year's output will be 45.4 times higher. It is expected to increase by 45,000 tons compared to 1959. Albania's largest chromium mine is Bulqizë, followed by Martanesh and Kalimash.

    In order to further develop the mining industry, Albania is vigorously strengthening geological exploration work.

    The results of various studies have proven that Albania has rich deposits of oil, chromium ore, copper, and ferronickel ore. Therefore, the task of geological exploration is very arduous.

    It is planned that twelve new oil structures will produce oil this year, and ferronickel ore will continue to be explored. In addition, Albanian geologists will put the new ferronickel ore Përenjas into operation, which has richer reserves than Pishkash.

    Work to find chromium ore seedlings will be carried out in the Martanesh, Kukës, and Tropojë areas. Copper ore will be explored in Kukës, in addition to Mirdita.

    Albania's geological exploration work is a newly established scientific department, but it has achieved significant achievements. In the four years of the Second Five-Year Plan alone (1956-1959), Albanian geologists discovered eight different mineral deposits, all of which have been mined one by one.

    阿尔巴尼亚党政和工会领导机构向全民发出号召
    开展大规模竞赛保证胜利完成五年计划
    广大劳动人民提出增产保证　今年工业生产将有显著增长
    新华社地拉那26日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央、部长会议、民主阵线全国委员会和工会中央理事会25日联合发表决议，号召全国工人、农业合作社社员和人民知识分子为胜利完成第二个五年计划（1956—1960年），开展一个新的、大规模的社会主义竞赛运动。
    决议指出，开展社会主义竞赛的目的不仅在于完成生产总值，而且要尽快地改进产品质量、厉行节约、加强纪律，以及从组织上和经济上巩固农业合作社。
    在竞赛中获得胜利的企业和城市将获得优胜红旗和奖状。为了领导这一工作，政府各部、群众团体和有关的中央机关将组成社会主义竞赛中央委员会。
    今年是阿尔巴尼亚第二个五年计划的最后一年，新年以来，全国工人、职员和广大农民就积极展开了增产运动，并纷纷地向劳动党中央提出增产保证。皮希卡什铁镍矿的全体职工保证要提前三个月完成第二个五年计划，并决定以103％的成绩来完成1960年的生产计划和超额为国家生产七千三百五十吨铁镍矿石。卢希尼12月29日国营农场职工提出要提高玉米和棉花的单位面积产量，以100．77％的成绩来完成1960年的粮食上交任务。科尔察区的全体劳动人民向全国各区发出了友谊挑战，他们保证要超额完成1960年的工农业生产，并订出了具体的保证。科尔察区劳动人民的友谊挑战很快获得了全国各个厂矿企业的响应，并纷纷提出了应战的条件和订出了更高的指标。
    本报讯　今年，阿尔巴尼亚各工业部门的生产将迅速地增长，今年的工业产量将达到战前1938年的二十四点七倍，就是说，今年不到十四天的产量就相等于1938年全年的产量。
    第二个五年计划将在今年内完成。根据阿尔巴尼亚劳动党1959年二月中央全会的规定，今年的工业产量将比去年增长11％。在工业若干部门里，生产都将有显著提高。石油将增加18％；铬矿17％；镍铁矿47％；电力工业17％；建筑材料工业38％；食品工业15％；机械和金属冶炼工业18％。
    和1959年相比，工业部门的劳动生产率将提高12％。
    本报讯　阿尔巴尼亚的采矿业获得巨大的发展，1959年的铜产量比1946年增加了十三倍以上。生铜的产量超过了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第三次代表大会为第二个五年计划前四年规定的任务的35％，同时还超过了1958年二月全会为同一时期规定的任务的12％。这四年中开采的铜比第一个五年计划头四年开采的铜已增加了三倍半。
    阿尔巴尼亚铬矿的面貌有了无法想像的变化。第二个五年计划的几年中，铬矿工业有了很大的发展。它完成了扩大后的开采计划（1956年—1959年）的103％。
    今年铬产量还将不断地增加。和1938年相比，今年的产量将多四十五点四倍。预计要比1959年增产四万五千吨。阿尔巴尼亚最大的铬矿是布尔基兹，其次是玛尔塔纳希和卡里马希。
    为了进一步发展采矿业，阿尔巴尼亚正大力加强地质勘探工作。
    从各种研究的结果证明，阿尔巴尼亚有丰富的石油、铬矿、铜和镍铁矿藏。因此地质勘探的任务十分繁重。
    计划今年将有十二个新的石油结构喷油，镍铁矿将继续勘探。此外，阿尔巴尼亚的地质工作者将把新的镍铁矿彼雷尼阿斯投入开采，其蕴藏量比彼希加希更为丰富。
    在玛尔塔奈希、库克斯和脱洛博亚等地区将进行寻找铬矿苗的工作。除了米尔地塔以外，将在库克斯勘探铜矿。
    阿尔巴尼亚的地质勘探工作是新建立的科学部门，然而它已获得了重大的成就。仅在第二个五年计划的四年中（1956年—1959年），阿尔巴尼亚的地质工作者发现了八个不同的矿藏，都一个个进行开采了。
