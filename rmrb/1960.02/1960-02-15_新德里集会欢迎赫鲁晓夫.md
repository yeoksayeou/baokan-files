Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 13th. A grand civic rally was held in the Indian capital on the 12th to welcome Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev.

    Khrushchev delivered a speech at the rally. He spoke of the Soviet Union's consistent adherence to a policy of peace. He said that the Soviet peace initiatives have received the warmest support and approval from all peace-loving people. He pointed out, "The forces opposing the relaxation of international tensions must not be underestimated. To overcome their resistance, new efforts are needed from friends of peace."

    At the rally, he also announced two agreements signed that day by the Soviet and Indian governments: one on the use of the 1.5 billion ruble loan granted to India by the Soviet Union under the loan agreement signed by the two countries last September, and the other a cultural and scientific cooperation agreement. He said that under the former agreement, the Soviet Union will help India build and expand dozens of the most important industrial enterprises during the Third Five-Year Plan.
