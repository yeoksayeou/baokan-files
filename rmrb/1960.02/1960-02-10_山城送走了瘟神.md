Party Secretary's Notes:

    Mountain City Bids Farewell to the Plague God
    Cheng Jingyi, Secretary of the Jianning County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    Spring fills Jianning's garden,
    Ten thousand households celebrate sending off the plague,
    Eliminating pests and diseases, promoting hygiene,
    The banks of the Sui River wear a new look.
    In this season of bright spring, when people come to Jianning, they will feel how clean and beautiful this mountain city is! Colored archways stand tall on the roads, and a winding, emerald green stream flows around the city; the avenue along the city wall has a smooth and flat surface; in the city, the streets paved with bricks and stones are wide, straight, clean, and dust-free; the spittoons and waste bins under the eaves are arranged neatly and orderly. From the beginning to the end of the street, it is difficult to find traces of sputum or fruit peels. The shops are clean and bright, and pedestrians on the street come and go, filled with laughter. The commune members coming from the countryside are all dressed cleanly and are full of energy. Among these people, it is difficult to find thin and sickly patients, and no one looks listless. This thriving scene, how can it not make people feel happy and delighted!
    In the vast rural areas of Jianning, there are even more attractive things. Whether from the steep Panhu Pass down to the turbulent banks of the Suichuan River, from the "heavenly dwellings" of the She ethnic highlands to the lush forests of the eight townships of Dong'an, everything is filled with prosperity and joy.
    In Yanglin Brigade, north of Jianning County, ten years ago it was a place where "ten thousand households were desolate, and ghosts were singing," with only a few dilapidated houses and a patch of reeds. Now, the villages here are clean and fresh, the snow-white earthen walls are adorned with colorful murals, and schools of fish swim in the clear ponds. The dirt roads are dust-free, and the streets and alleys are swept clean. There is not a trace of odor in the air, and what hits the nose is the fresh scent emanating from the fertile fields and the alluring fragrance of wintersweet. Because here, like all parts of the county, pig and cattle pens have long been moved to the fields, toilets and dung buckets have been reformed, and even sewage and garbage have been sent to fertilizer plants. As for the commune members' residences, they are also very different from the past. Old Grandma Chen Guilan, in the village, used to burn incense and kowtow to the Bodhisattva every day. She was afraid that washing the door panels would wash away her good fortune, and that sweeping the courtyard would drive away the god of wealth. But now, she actually took the incense burner, which her ancestors regarded as a deity, and used it as a spittoon! You only need to look at the new Spring Festival couplet posted on her doorstep, "Eliminating the Four Pests brings fortune as boundless as the East Sea, paying attention to hygiene brings longevity like the everlasting pine of Nanshan," and you will know what the old grandma thinks now. Then there is Grandma He, who used to be convinced that swatting flies would cause blindness, and she would not kill a bedbug or crush an ant. But now she has become an activist in eliminating the Four Pests. Last summer, she even took the money she had to buy salt and bought a fly swatter to kill flies. Her home is in a tile-roofed house shaded by green trees in the west of the village. Although the house is old, it is washed as if it were newly built. The hall is spacious and bright. The ancestral shrine has long been demolished and replaced with a portrait of Chairman Mao; the Kitchen God shrine has long been replaced by a sanitation convention. The room is clean and bright, and the floor is smooth. When people walk in, even if the host does not ask you to take off your shoes, you will feel embarrassed not to. However, in recent days, she, like the people in the village, is anxious about the hygiene and fertilizer accumulation campaign, because the village is accumulating hygienic fertilizer, but no dust can be swept out of the house, and no mud can be raked out of the ditches. She has to sweep the streets and alleys over and over again, and wash the walls and furniture again and again….
    Then there is Huangling Brigade, which used to be the most serious filariasis epidemic area. More than 400 of the brigade's 1,000 people were infected. Six or seven out of ten people had swollen legs, and productivity was low, with a yield of only a hundred catties per mu. Now, filariasis has been basically eliminated here, and it is difficult to find people with thick legs in the entire brigade. In particular, after the communization, the Party and the government have conducted four consecutive examinations and treatments for the masses, so that Yang Laoer, who was famous for his "legs like buckets," can often go to work. Not long ago, when health workers were conducting the final sweep treatment here, a woman who had just married from a neighboring county refused to receive treatment. The masses persuaded her, and finally convinced her to accept treatment. Yes, who can understand the joy after eliminating the disease more deeply than the people of Huangling Brigade? Look! How happy are the people working in this vast field! Smiles appear on their dark faces, and their strong arms contain endless power. They are building their hometown according to the blueprint of the future. Commune member Nie Huibiao used to suffer from filariasis and often had "bloody urine." He could only work two workdays a month. Now he works full time every month and has done more than 1,000 work points in the past year alone. However, Huangling Brigade is not the only one like him. Jianning County is not just one Huangling Brigade that has eliminated filariasis! Without going into the numbers of patients treated in the county, let's just take the following example: in the county's military service physical examination in 1957, 21 out of every 100 young people had filaria in their blood; while in the physical examination in 1958, only one was found among 150 people.
    As for the joyful atmosphere of healthy and happy commune members in the public canteen, it is even more indescribable. At this time, which canteen is not more lively than a big happy event in the past! Since the county's canteens have achieved "five modernizations" (steaming rice, diversifying dishes, providing comprehensive care, using tap water, and ensuring cleanliness and hygiene), not only men are happy, women are happy, but even the old men are smiling with their beards. Take Xikou Canteen as an example. Its "five modernizations" work was originally somewhat famous in the province, but people did not stop there. Everyone felt that in this opening-red day of the new spring, there should be some creativity. So the commune members and cooks started to brainstorm again, and mechanized vegetable cutting, vehicular transportation, and so on were all implemented. When it comes to meal time, it's so lively, with heat rising in the air, the aroma of meat floating, dozens of dining tables are full of people, cooks wearing white clothes and hats push carts carrying rice and vegetables, shuttling back and forth, plus the newly whitewashed walls, lined with red and green slogans and pictures, making the hall full of joy and festivity. How can such a canteen not be good? No wonder everyone says, "The canteen is like paradise."
    Children are free from the threat of the plague and are growing up like flowers. From the rosy cheeks of the children in nurseries and kindergartens, people seem to see a happy future, and from the delicate singing they hear beautiful ideals. The Party committee secretaries who work hard all day long never forget to come here to see them, and the health workers in the health stations also often hang around in the nurseries. As for the nannies - these cultivators of the flowers of the motherland - they are always thinking about "eating well, playing well, and being hygienic" for the children, and even the cooks in the canteen often come to listen to what the children hope for in life. Under the Party's meticulous care, no infectious diseases have been prevalent in the county's 396 childcare organizations in the past year or so, and more than 3,000 children are growing up healthily. Zhu Xiaojuan, in the Qucun Brigade kindergarten, was a little girl who was "sick every three days," but now Zhu Xiaojuan has become a very strong and beautiful child, and a little singer in the kindergarten. Even her grandfather, 73-year-old Zhu Renhe, smiled and said when he struggled to pick up his granddaughter: "The children in the commune grow so fast that they are hard to hold."
    This is Jianning today!
    How fast the pace of the times is moving! Not long ago, this remote little county in the mountains has now become a new city with basically "four noes"; not long ago, the people of Jianning, who were oppressed by poverty and disease, have now realized the beautiful life scene of "every family pays attention to hygiene, everyone loves cleanliness, all industries are thriving, and people and animals are prosperous." Jianning has bid farewell to the plague god, shaken off the dark dust of history, and is moving towards a better future.

    山城送走了瘟神
    中共福建建宁县委书记　程景伊
    满园春色到建宁，
    万户欢腾送瘟神，
    除害灭病讲卫生，
    濉溪两岸气象新。
    在这春光明媚的季节，当人们来到建宁的时候，都会感到这座山城是多么整洁美丽！公路上矗立着的彩色牌楼，一弯碧绿的溪水绕城而过；城墙边上的大马路，地面光洁平坦；城中，砖石铺成的街道宽敞平直，干净无尘；屋檐下的痰盂、果皮箱，排列的整齐有序。从街头到街尾，很难找到痰迹、果皮。商店里窗明几净，街上的行人熙来攘往，笑声四溢，从农村来的社员们，一个个穿着干净，神采奕奕。在这些人中间，很难找出面黄肌瘦的病者，也看不到谁还精神萎靡。这欣欣向荣的景象，怎不使人感到幸福，感到高兴！
    在建宁广阔的农村，吸引人的事情就更多了。不论从险峻的蟠湖隘下到江面汹涌的濉川之滨，由号称“天上人家”中畬高地到林木苍郁的东安八乡，到处都充满了繁荣和欢乐的景象。
    在建宁县城北面有个杨林大队，十年前这里是“万户萧疏鬼唱歌”的地方，只有几幢破屋，一片芦苇。如今这儿村村整洁清新，雪白的土墙上，彩色壁画琳琅满目，碧清的池塘里，鱼群游来游去。泥土道上尘土不扬，街头巷尾扫的净光。空气中没有一点臭味，扑鼻而来的是肥沃田野中散发出的新鲜气息和腊梅的诱人清香。因为这里和全县各地一样，猪、牛栏早已迁移田间，厕所粪桶经过了改革，就连污水和垃圾也都送进了肥料厂。至于社员们的住宅，也跟过去大不一般了。村头的陈桂兰老妈妈，从前是天天要给菩萨上香、磕头的人，她怕洗门板会洗掉福气，怕扫庭院会赶走财神，可是，如今她居然把祖祖辈辈视为神明的香炉，拿下来当了痰盂！你只消看看她家门口贴着的“除四害福如东海长流水，讲卫生寿比南山不老松。”这副新春联，就会知道老妈妈现在的想法是怎样的了。再说何妈妈吧，她过去是确信打了苍蝇会瞎眼睛的，平时手不肯抹死一个臭虫，脚不肯踩坏一个蚂蚁。然而现在她却成了一个除四害的积极分子。去年夏天，她曾经将买盐的钱，先拿去买了蝇拍来消灭苍蝇。她的家就在村西一幢绿树掩映的瓦屋里，虽然房屋古旧，但洗刷的像新建的屋宅。厅堂宽敞明亮。过去的神龛早已拆除，贴上了毛主席的像；厨房的灶君神位也早已被卫生公约所代替。房间里窗明几净，地板光洁。人走进去时，纵使主人不叫你脱鞋，自己心里也要过意不去。不过，这些天来，她也和村里的人们一样，正为卫生积肥运动感到焦急，因为现在村里正积卫生肥，可室内外却打扫不出灰尘，沟渠里也耙不出污泥，她只好在街头巷尾扫了又扫，把门壁家具洗了又洗……。
    再说黄岭大队吧，这里过去是最严重的丝虫病流行区，全大队一千余人，就有四百多人患病。群众十有六、七是双脚臃肿者，生产力低落，亩产才百余斤。现在，这里的丝虫病基本消灭了，全大队很难找到大粗腿的人了。特别是公社化后，党和政府又连续为群众进行了四次检查与治疗，使得那个出名的“两脚像水桶”的杨老二，也能经常出工了。不久前，卫生人员在这里进行最后一次扫尾治疗时，山滩村有一个自邻县新嫁来的妇女不肯治疗，群众就你一言我一语地劝她，终于把这个妇女思想说通了，接受了治疗。是的，有谁还能比黄岭大队的人们更深刻地体会到消灭疾病后的欢乐呢？看吧！在这广阔田野里劳动着的人们，是多么愉快呀！他们黝黑的脸上浮现着笑容，他们粗壮的臂膀，蕴藏着无穷的力量。他们正在按着未来的蓝图，建设着自己的家乡。社员聂辉标，过去患丝虫病，常年“下血”，一个月只能出两个工。现在可是月月出满工了，光去年一年就多做了一千多工分。然而，黄岭大队何止他一人如此呢？建宁县又何止一个黄岭大队消灭了丝虫病呢？这里且不说全县治疗病人的数目字，就以下面一个事例来说吧，1957年县里兵役体格检查时，一百个青年中就有二十一个在血液里有丝虫；而在1958年体格检查时，一百五十人当中才发现一个。
    至于在公共食堂里，健康愉快的社员们那股欢乐气氛更是说也说不完了。这时节，哪个食堂里也比过去大地主办喜事更热闹！自从全县食堂实现了“五化”（煮饭蒸汽化、饭菜多样化、照顾全面化、用水自来化、清洁卫生化）以后，不但男人们乐，妇女们乐，就连老头子也捻着胡子笑开了。就说溪口食堂吧，这里的“五化”工作本来在全省都是有些名气的，但人们并不就此止步，大家感到在这新春开门红的日子里，总要有点什么创造才对，于是社员们、炊事员们的脑筋又动开了，什么切菜机械化啦，运输车子化啦等等都搞起来了。一到开饭，可热闹啦，空中腾着热气，飘着肉香，几十张饭桌，坐得满满的，穿戴着白衣白帽的炊事员推着运送饭菜的车子，穿梭似的走来走去，再加上周围墙上新近刚刷过石灰，衬着那红红绿绿的标语图画，更显得满堂欢乐，喜气洋洋。这样的食堂怎么不好呢？怪不得大家口口声声说：“食堂赛天堂”了。
    孩子们摆脱了瘟神的威胁，像鲜花一样茁壮地成长。人们从托儿所、幼儿园的孩子们白里透红的脸蛋上，似乎看出了幸福的未来，从娇嫩的歌声中听到了美好的理想。终日操劳的党委书记们，总忘不了来这里看看，保健站里的卫生员也时常在托儿所中打转，至于阿姨们——这些祖国花朵的培育者，更是成日在为孩子们“吃好、玩好、卫生好”着想，就连食堂的炊事员也经常来听听孩子们在生活上有什么希望。在党的无微不至的关怀下，全县三百九十六个托儿组织中，一年多来就没流行过传染病，三千多个孩子们，都在健康地成长。渠村大队幼儿园里的祝小?，在家里时是个“三朝两日病”的小女孩，可是现在祝小?却成了个挺结实漂亮的小孩，成为幼儿园里的小歌唱家了。连她祖父七十三岁的祝仁和吃力地抱起孙女时也笑着说：“公社里的孩子长的真快，快抱不动了”。
    这就是今天的建宁！
    时代的脚步迈得多快啊！曾几何时，这个万山丛中的偏僻小县，今天已经成为一个基本“四无”的新城了；曾几何时，在贫穷和疾病压榨之下的建宁人民，今天已经实现了“家家讲卫生，人人爱清洁，百业俱兴，人畜兴旺”的生活美景。建宁，送走了瘟神，抖落了历史的阴暗灰尘，正向着更美好的未来迈进。
