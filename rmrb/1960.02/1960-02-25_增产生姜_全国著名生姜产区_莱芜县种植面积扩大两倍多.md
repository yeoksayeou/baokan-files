Increase Ginger Production
Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 23rd. Laiwu County, Shandong Province, a nationally renowned ginger-producing area, will expand its ginger cultivation area from more than 2,300 mu last year to 8,000 mu this year. The planting plan has been implemented down to the teams. In order to strive for high ginger yields, members of the specialized teams in ginger-producing communes have started activities such as plowing, fertilizer accumulation, and seed selection earlier than in previous years. At present, the communes have deep-plowed more than 1,800 mu of ginger fields and accumulated more than 1 million dan of high-quality fertilizer.

Laiwu ginger has many advantages: thin skin, spicy taste, tender flesh, few fibers, low moisture content, and resistance to storage. This county has always been one of the national ginger production bases. Since communization, the county's ginger production has greatly increased. Last year, the average yield per unit area in the county increased by more than 80% compared with the previous year. Therefore, even with a slight reduction in planting area, the total output still increased by 11% compared with 1958.

In leading ginger production, the Laiwu County Party Committee has always implemented the spirit of "grasping early, grasping well, and grasping firmly," with a county party secretary in charge, seeing it through to the end. Every year, they lead the ginger-producing communes in planning and arranging ginger production, fixing ginger planting land, establishing specialized ginger production teams, and implementing a "three-guarantee and one-reward" system of guaranteeing work, guaranteeing output, guaranteeing costs, and rewarding overproduction, thereby avoiding the phenomenon of competing for land for planting and competing for labor during busy seasons.

    增产生姜
    全国著名生姜产区—莱芜县种植面积扩大两倍多
    据新华社济南23日电　全国著名的莱芜姜产区——山东莱芜县，今年生姜栽培面积将由去年的二千三百多亩扩大到八千亩，种植计划已经落实到队。为了力争生姜高产，产姜公社专业队的社员们，比往年提早展开了翻地、积肥、选种等活动。目前，各公社已深翻姜地一千八百多亩，积造的优质肥料有一百多万担。
    莱芜姜有许多优点：皮薄，味辣，肉嫩，纤维少，水分少，耐储藏。这个县历来是全国生姜生产基地之一。公社化以后，这个县的生姜产量有很大提高，去年全县生姜平均单位面积产量比前年增长八成以上，因此在种植面积有所减少的情况下，总产量仍比1958年增长11％。
    中共莱芜县委在领导生姜生产中，始终贯彻了抓早抓好抓狠的精神，由一名县委书记负责，一抓到底。每年都领导产姜公社全盘规划和安排生姜生产，固定种姜土地，成立生姜生产专业队，实行了包工、包产、包成本和超产奖励的“三包一奖”制，因而避免了种植争地、大忙争人的现象。
