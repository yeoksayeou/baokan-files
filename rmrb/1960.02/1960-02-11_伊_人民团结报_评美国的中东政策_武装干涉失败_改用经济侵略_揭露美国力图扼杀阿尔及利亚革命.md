Baghdad dispatch: The Iraqi newspaper "People's Unity" recently published a series of articles exposing new U.S. conspiracies to invade Arab countries. The articles pointed out that after the failure of U.S. imperialists’ policy of armed aggression against Arab countries, they have adopted a new strategy of carrying out economic aggression under the guise of economic "aid." The articles also condemned the U.S. attempt to strangle the Algerian revolution.

The article stated: "For a long time, the United States has used direct pressure through its aggressive alliances to deal with Arab countries. Whether these aggressive alliances are openly led by the United States (such as the 'Middle East Command,' the 'Northern Tier of Middle East Defense,' and the 'Eisenhower Doctrine'), or whether the United States pretends not to participate (such as the 'Baghdad Pact'), the Arab people know what is hidden behind these commands and treaties. Direct occupation or the flexing of muscles by the Sixth Fleet has not intimidated the Arab people, and even the U.S. ruling authorities themselves have admitted the failure of this policy." The article then pointed out that U.S. imperialists have therefore adopted some new methods to continue their aggression against Arab countries: "First, to carry out economic aggression against these countries under the guise of economic assistance through the World Bank and other American banks, as well as other similar world development organizations or West German capital enterprises with a global facade. Second, under the guise of opposing communism, to create a reactionary bloc composed of some Middle Eastern countries. The aim is to pave the way for American domination under the pretext of cooperating with all countries that have reached agreement with the United States on the issue of opposing communism."

The article, in exposing the U.S. conspiracy to stifle the Algerian revolution, wrote: "Oil monopoly capital has predatory ambitions towards the Algerian oil emerging from the Sahara Desert. …Therefore, U.S. monopoly capital believes that the tenacious democratic and liberation orientation pursued by the Algerian revolution not only poses a devastating threat to their interests in Algeria, but also threatens their economic interests in neighboring Arab countries. Therefore, U.S. imperialists still place their military forces in the Atlantic Treaty under the control of France in order to strike at the heroic Algerian people. Their attitude towards the Algerian question on the international stage is consistent with the imperialist policy they derive from the essence of imperialist interests."

    伊“人民团结报”评美国的中东政策
    武装干涉失败　改用经济侵略
    揭露美国力图扼杀阿尔及利亚革命
    本报讯　巴格达消息：伊拉克“人民团结报”不久前连续载文揭露美国侵略阿拉伯国家的新阴谋。文章指出，美帝国主义者在武装侵略阿拉伯国家的政策失败后，采取了新的策略，在经济“援助”的幌子下进行经济侵略。文章并谴责美国企图扼杀阿尔及利亚革命。
    文章写道：“长期以来，美国通过它的侵略性同盟以直接的压力来对付阿拉伯国家。无论这种侵略性同盟是由美国起公开领导作用的也好（如‘中东司令部’、‘中东防御的北部地带’和‘艾森豪威尔主义’），或者美国佯装不参加的也好（如‘巴格达条约’）。但是，阿拉伯人民知道在这些司令部和条约的后面暗藏的是什么。直接的占领或者第六舰队的耀武扬威并没有吓倒阿拉伯人民，甚至连美国统治当局本身也承认了这个政策的失败。”文章接着指出，美帝国主义者于是采取了一些新的手法来继续侵略阿拉伯国家，“第一是通过世界银行和其他的美国银行以及另外一些类似世界发展机构或西德资本的具有世界性的招牌的企业，在经济援助的幌子下向这些国家进行经济侵略。第二是在反对共产主义的幌子下制造一个由一部分中东国家组成的反动集团。其目的是在同所有在反对共产主义问题上同美国取得了一致的国家相互合作的借口下为美国的统治铺平道路。”
    文章在揭露美国夭折阿尔及利亚革命的阴谋时写道：“石油垄断资本对撒哈拉大沙漠涌现出来的阿尔及利亚石油是有霸占的野心的。……所以，美国垄断资本认为阿尔及利亚革命所奉行的顽强的民主解放方针，不仅使他们在阿尔及利亚的利益受到毁灭性的威胁，而且使他们在近邻的阿拉伯国家中的经济利益也要受到威胁。因此，美帝国主义者仍旧把它们在大西洋公约中的军事力量置于法国的支配之下，以便打击英勇的阿尔及利亚人民。它们在国际场合上对待阿尔及利亚问题的态度同它们从帝国主义利益的本质中引伸出来的帝国主义政策是一致的。”
