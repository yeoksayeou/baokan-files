	Flowers of Education, Crucible of Revolution
	——A Profile of Jiangxi Communist Labor University
	By Our Staff Reporter
	The Great Leap Forward of 1958 sowed a new flower in Jiangxi. This fresh seedling is already showing its branches and leaves above the wall, emitting a fresh fragrance, and is about to bloom. This is the Communist Labor University, which is growing and becoming stronger. This school is not only huge in scale, but also has a novel style. It is like a churning crucible, tempering more than 55,000 young people. Here, we only collect a few small stories from what we have heard and seen.
	
	From Beggar to College Student
	After building school buildings on barren mountains, the students of the Yunshan Branch went on to burn charcoal to support steel production. Once, when the students were firing charcoal in the kiln, the kiln door had just been opened when flames shot out, and black smoke billowed, stinging their eyes so much they couldn't open them. It turned out that some of the firewood in the kiln hadn't been completely burned. If measures weren't taken, an entire kiln of charcoal would be reduced to ashes. At this moment, a young man of medium stature with a dark complexion raised his rough, black hands, picked up a hoe, and rushed to the kiln door, disregarding everything, and dug the charcoal out of the kiln, hoe by hoe. When the students dragged him away from the kiln, his hair was already burnt, and his skin was red and swollen from the heat. He immediately fainted on the ground. He was Hu Rigao, a "Five-Good" student at the Yunshan Branch.
	When Hu Rigao was one year old, his father died; when he was six, his mother also passed away. He was left alone, wandering the streets, begging from door to door, enduring the cold eyes and insults of the rich. It wasn't until liberation that he saw the light of day. In 1958, he heard that the Communist Labor University was recruiting students and was very happy. However, he still had concerns: "Would they want this old roughneck from a beggar's background?" To his surprise, when he took his letter of introduction to the admissions office and explained his situation, the comrade at the admissions office patted him on the shoulder and said, "You're wrong. Our Labor University is set up for people like you. Come on in, you're welcome!" From then on, Hu Rigao came to the Yunshan Branch of the Communist Labor University. From the day he came to the school, he regarded the school as his home. No matter what he did, he had a lot of energy. He often said:
	“We poor people couldn't even get enough to eat in the old society. Now the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are letting us go to college. The school is our home. I want to do everything I can to learn well.”
	The first lesson of intensive labor training passed, followed by cultural classes. When he walked into the classroom, holding the newly issued books, and listened to the teacher's lectures, he couldn't understand what the teacher was saying. Especially math class, which was as difficult as climbing the sky. What to do? He became distressed. At this time, the comrades of the school's Party branch came to him to educate and encourage him. From then on, he regained his courage and studied hard. If he didn't recognize all the words in the textbook, he would read and recognize them thousands and thousands of times. After class, he would stay in the classroom, holding the book, asking this and that. To clarify a problem and complete an assignment, he stayed up at night, studying diligently. The difficult barrier was finally broken. He went from not recognizing Arabic numerals to completing junior high school algebra; from not understanding the term "chemistry" to learning high school chemistry. Hu Rigao's deeds of studying hard and actively participating in labor spread throughout Yunshan, and he was repeatedly named a "Five-Good" student.
	
	From Doubt to Love
	Li Yutai was a high school graduate. In the autumn of 1959, he was admitted to the Nanfeng Labor University Branch – the Mandarin Orange University. At that time, his thinking fluctuated greatly. He thought to himself: he was a high school graduate, and it was a bit inappropriate to study and work part-time with junior high school and elementary school students. Besides, this school hasn't been open for long, the facilities aren't perfect, and there are few teachers. What can I learn? But after arriving at the school, this idea was quickly dispelled. He saw that many of his old classmates, although they were only junior high school graduates or dropouts, had reached the level of a high school sophomore in mathematics, physics, and chemistry after a year of study. Now they are learning a lot of college textbooks. More importantly, they have mastered the skills of general technicians and are experts in the management of orange seedlings and orange trees.
	In the past, he thought that tending to oranges was an easy task. Picking oranges, grafting and pruning, what's so difficult about that? But as soon as he came into contact with reality, problems arose. For example, when picking oranges, he initially thought that picking them by hand was enough, why use scissors? After studying and practicing, he realized that picking by hand was not only slow, but also easily damaged the branches, affecting the fruit yield in the following year. Although the school doesn't have famous professors, the teachers have practical knowledge and rich experience. They explain things in a simple and easy-to-understand way. They teach a lesson today, and the students will practice it during labor tomorrow. Sometimes, they even take students to the orange groves for class. This kind of class is both lively and practical. For example, when teaching about the main diseases of mandarin oranges, they use diseased leaves as teaching materials, teaching prevention and control methods so that students learn how to mix pesticides. During labor, they remove diseased leaves or spray Bordeaux mixture.
	In this way, in a few months, Li Yutai not only firmly grasped the knowledge in the classroom; at the same time, in a short few months, he also learned techniques such as pruning, pest control, orange seedling transplantation, and cold protection. Therefore, he felt that this school was very warm and deeply fell in love with Mandarin Orange University.
	
	A Live Demonstration
	One day in early December last year, an old horse on the state farm was about to die. After hearing this news, the teachers of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine Department of the main campus thought it was a good opportunity to have a dissection class and brought it over for research. However, dissecting something this big was a first for them. There was no immersion table, nor a corresponding dissection table or bleachers for use. After discussing together, the teachers finally found a way to use formalin injection for preservation and burying and preserving the horse's body. Ordinary tables were used to replace the dissection table, and desks and chairs were lined up to serve as bleachers. After the equipment problem was solved, the teachers began preparing lessons with confidence. They faced the books, holding knives and forceps, looking for nerves and blood vessels, pondering and studying each other. After a night of hard work, a four-day course schedule was arranged, waiting to go on stage.
	The live demonstration began, and the laboratory of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine Department was really lively. Students sat row by row on makeshift bleachers made of desks and chairs, listening to the teacher's explanation and carefully watching each organ the teacher pointed to. In order to ensure that the students could observe and familiarize themselves with the shape, size, and position of each organ in detail, the teacher sent the specimens to the students one or two times until they could see clearly, and then continued to explain. After the students understood everything, the teacher also assigned several students to do it themselves. In this way, the students could easily understand and remember firmly.
	After the live demonstration ended, the department decided to conduct a test on this dissection class. The secretary of the department's Party branch also participated in the proctoring. More than eighty test slips were issued, with a total of more than one hundred and sixty questions, requiring students to not only comprehensively master the basic content of the course, but also dissect it themselves. As a result, the vast majority of students did very well, with more than 57% of the students achieving excellent results.

	A Lover's Letter
	Late at night, the students of the Forestry Department of the Damao Branch were all asleep, only Yang Suhua was lying in bed, unable to sleep. In the two months since she enrolled, her lover had written to her three times, urging her to go back. The letters vaguely revealed that she wouldn't learn anything at the Labor University. Today, her lover wrote again, repeating the same old arguments. Yang Suhua didn't think so. In the two months since entering school, she deeply felt the benefits of this university. She also remembered the pain of not having an education in the past: when she was the head of an agricultural cooperative in 1956, she encountered so many obstacles in her work because she didn't have an education! Now, the Party has given her the opportunity to receive a university education, how can she give it up! She decided to write another letter to persuade her lover. She firmly believed that one day, in the face of facts, her lover would be persuaded.
	Yes, what could be more convincing than facts? This daughter of a poor peasant who had only completed elementary school for a year, like a brave warrior, launched a tenacious attack on chemistry, physics, algebra, etc. She recited those difficult-to-remember formulas and nouns over and over again, and repeatedly asked teachers and classmates for advice. Late at night, when the other students were asleep, she was still studying by candlelight; when she was too tired, she would go out for a walk and immediately come back to study. Sometimes, it would take her the entire Sunday to solve an algebraic equation. In just one year, she reached the level of a second-year junior high school student.
	Last summer vacation, she went to Nanchang to visit her lover, whom she had been separated from for a year. To convince her lover, she brought back her school's exam report card. At first, her lover was a little skeptical: an elementary school student, in less than a year, had completed the junior high school curriculum? But a very interesting "exam" completely convinced him. One day, their fellow villager, a junior high school graduate, came to their house to play. When he learned that Yang Suhua was studying at the Communist Labor University, he asked, "What are you learning there?" Yang Suhua replied, "A lot! There's algebra, physics, chemistry..." "Chemistry?" the other party "tested" her intentionally or unintentionally, "How far have you learned?" "I've learned about decomposition reactions, double decomposition reactions. Molecular theory, and compounds have already been learned!" she replied. "Ah!" The other party was very surprised and then fell silent. When Yang Suhua excitedly talked about how to comprehensively utilize Masson's pine to extract tannin extract, activated carbon, etc., her lover and fellow villager both showed admiration on their faces. Looking at her report card again, they were all above eighty points. At this time, her lover not only stopped advising her to drop out of school, but also encouraged her to go back to school as soon as possible, so as not to delay her studies.

    教育的花朵　革命的熔炉
    ——江西共产主义劳动大学侧记
    本报记者
    1958年的大跃进，在江西播下了一株新花。这朵新鲜的幼苗，已经是枝叶出墙，散发着清新的香味，含苞待放了。这就是在日益成长壮大中的共产主义劳动大学。这所学校不仅规模巨大，且有新颖的风格。她像一座翻腾的熔炉，陶冶着五万五千多青年。这里，我们仅就耳闻目睹，集纳几个小故事。
    从乞丐到大学生
    云山分校的同学们，在荒山上建成了校舍之后，接着，就去烧木炭，支援钢铁生产。一次同学们上窑炭，窑门刚打开，火舌就伸出来，黑烟滚滚，熏得眼睛都睁不开。原来，窑里还有一部分窑柴没烧完，如果不采取措施，眼看一窑炭就要全部化为灰烬。这时，有一个中等身材、面孔黝黑的青年，举起两只粗黑的手，拿起锄头，不顾一切冲到窑门跟前，把木炭一锄一锄地从窑里掏出来。同学们把他拖离窑洞时，他的头发已经烧焦了，皮肤也烤得红肿，立即昏倒在地下。他，就是云山分校的五好学生胡日高。
    胡日高一岁时，父亲就死了；六岁时，母亲也去世。就剩下他一个人，流落街头，挨门乞讨，受尽了有钱人的冷眼和辱骂。直到解放，他才见了天日。1958年，他听说共产主义劳动大学要招生，心里很高兴。可是，他还有顾虑：“人家会不会要这叫花子出身的老粗啊？”出乎他的意料之外，当他拿着介绍信到招生处说明自己的情况以后，招生处的同志拍着他的肩膀说：“你想错了，我们的劳动大学，就是为你们开办的，来吧，欢迎你！”从此，胡日高就来到了共产主义劳动大学云山分校。打从来校那天起，他就把学校当成自己的家。无论做什么，都有一股子干劲。他经常讲：
  “我们穷人在旧社会连饭都吃不上，现在共产党、毛主席让我们进大学，学校就是我们的家，我要尽一切力量学好。”
    紧张的劳动锻炼的第一课过去了，接着就是上文化课。当他走进课堂，拿着新发给的书本，听老师讲课时，他没有办法理解老师讲的东西。特别是上数学课，更是难如上青天。怎么办？他苦恼起来了。这时，学校党支部的同志来到了他的跟前，教育他，鼓励他。从此，他就重新鼓起勇气，发愤苦读，课本上的字认不全，就千遍万遍地读、认。下课了，他还留在教室里，拿着书本，问这问那。为了弄清一个问题，完成一篇作业，他守着灯，在夜里刻苦学习。难关终于被突破了。他从不认识阿拉伯数字，已学完了初中代数；从不懂化学这个名词，学到高中化学。胡日高刻苦学习、积极劳动的事迹传遍了整个云山，他一次又一次地被评为五好学生。
    由怀疑到热爱
    李裕泰是高中毕业生。1959年秋天，考上了南丰劳动大学分校——蜜桔大学。当时，他思想上波动得很厉害。心想：自己是一个高中毕业生，跟初中生、小学生一起半工半读，有些不相称。再说，这个学校开办时间不长，设备不完善，教师也少，能学到什么呢？可是到校不久，他的这种想法很快就打消了。他看到许多老同学虽然都是初中毕业或初中肄业的水平，但是经过一年的学习，数理化程度已具有高二的水平，现在学的很多是高等学校的教材。更重要的，是他们掌握了一般技工的技术，对桔苗、桔树的管理都是内行。
    过去，他认为侍弄桔子是件很容易的事。摘摘桔子，接接剪剪，有什么难的呢？可是一接触实际，问题就来了。如摘桔子，起初他以为用手摘就算了，何必还用剪刀去剪呢？经过学习实践，才知道手摘不但速度慢，而且容易损伤树枝，影响次年结果。学校虽然没有名教授，但是老师们都具有实际知识和丰富的经验。他们讲的深入浅出，通俗易懂。今天上了课，明天劳动时就实习，有时还领着学生到桔园里上课。这样讲的课，又生动、又实际。如讲蜜桔的主要病害，就找病树叶作教材，讲授防治方法，使学生学会配药剂。劳动时，便去摘除病叶或喷射波尔多液。
    这样，在几个月内，李裕泰不仅牢固地掌握了课堂上的知识；同时，在短短的几个月中，他还学会了剪枝、除虫、桔苗移植和防寒等技术。因此，他感到这个学校很温暖，深深地爱上了蜜桔大学。
    一次现场教学
    去年12月初的一天，农垦厅有一匹老马快死了。总校畜牧兽医系教师听到这一消息后，认为是上解剖课的好机会，就把它弄来进行研究。可是，解剖这样大的东西，还是头一次。既没有浸渍台，也没有一个相应的解剖台和看台供利用。几位老师共同讨论后，终于找到了用注射福尔马林防腐以及掩埋、保存马体的办法，解剖台就用普通桌子代替，把课桌椅排起来就当看台。设备问题解决后，教师们就信心百倍地开始备课。他们面对书本，手拿着刀镊，寻找神经血管，互相捉摸钻研。经过一夜苦战，四天教程安排好了，只等走上讲台。
    现场教学开始了，畜牧兽医系的实验室可真热闹，同学们一排排地坐在桌椅搭成的临时看台上，倾听老师讲解，仔细地看着老师所指的每一个组织器官。为了使同学们都能详细地观察和熟悉各器官的形态、大小和位置，老师一次两次地把标本送到同学面前，直到看清楚以后，再往下讲；等同学们都弄明白了以后，老师还指定几个同学自己动手。这样同学们既易听懂，又记得牢固。
    现场教学结束以后，系里决定就这次解剖课进行一次测验，系党支部书记也参加监考。发了八十多张考签，共有一百六十多个问题，要求同学们不仅全面掌握课程基本内容，还要自己动手解剖。结果，绝大多数同学成绩都很好，57％以上的同学获得了优良的成绩。
    爱人的来信
    夜深人静。大茅分校林学系的同学都入睡了，只有杨素华躺在床上睡不着。她入校两个多月来，爱人已三次来信催她回去。信中隐约地透露：在劳动大学不会学到什么东西。今天，她的爱人又来信了，还是那一套。杨素华可不以为然，入学两个月来，她深切地体会到这所大学的好处。她也想起了过去没有文化的痛苦：1956年当农业社长时，因为没有文化，在工作上碰了多少钉子呀！现在，党给了自己受大学教育的机会，怎么能放弃呢！她决定再次写信说服自己的爱人。她深信，终有一天在事实面前，她的爱人是会被说服的。
    是的，有什么能比事实更有说服力呢？这个仅仅读过高小一年的贫农的女儿，像个勇敢的战士一样，向化学、物理、代数等，发起了顽强的进攻。她一遍一遍地背诵着那些难记的公式、名词，一次再次地向老师同学请教。更深夜静，同学们都睡了，她还守着蜡烛作习题；太困了，就出去活动一下，马上又回来学习。有时，为了解一个代数方程式，会花掉整个星期日的时间。不过一年的时间，她就达到了初中二年级的水平。
    去年暑假，她到南昌去看望别离一年的爱人。为了说服自己的爱人，她把学校的期考成绩单带了回去。起初，她爱人还有点怀疑：一个高小生，不到一年功夫，把初中的课程都学完了？可是一次很有趣的“考试”，使他完全相信了。一天，他们的老乡、一个初中毕业生到他们家里去玩。当他知道杨素华在共产主义劳动大学读书时，就问道：“在那里学什么？”杨素华回答：“可多呢！有代数、物理、化学……”“化学？”对方有意无意地“考”起来了，“学到哪里了呢？”“学到分解反应，复分解反应。分子论，化合物早就学过了！”她回答道。“啊！”对方很吃惊，过后就默然了。当杨素华兴奋地谈到如何综合利用马尾松，提炼栲胶、活性炭等时，她的爱人和老乡脸上都显出钦佩的颜色。再看看她的成绩单，都是八十分以上。这时，她的爱人不但不再劝她退学，反而鼓励她早点回校，免得耽误学习。
