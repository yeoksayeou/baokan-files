    Implementing the Policy of Primarily Self-Breeding, Self-Selecting, Self-Retaining, and Self-Using, Supplemented by Adjustments
    Nan Dayuan Management District Achieves Surplus Vegetable Seed Self-Sufficiency
    Last Year's Vegetable Production Reached 70 Million Jin, with 90,000 Jin of Vegetable Seeds Transferred Out After Self-Use
    (Our Newspaper Report) The Nan Dayuan Management District of the Nanguan People's Commune in Baoding City, Hebei Province, has vegetable planting areas accounting for more than 60% of the total sown area, with an annual output of about 75 million jin of vegetables, including 76 varieties of 35 kinds of vegetables. In 1959, in addition to self-use, Nan Dayuan Management District also propagated 46 varieties for 44 units inside and outside the province, transferring out about 90,000 jin of seeds.
    The Nan Dayuan Management District has been able to achieve such great results mainly due to adhering to putting politics in command and implementing the “Four Selfs and One Supplement” (self-breeding, self-selection, self-retention, self-use, supplemented by adjustments) seed work policy. In specific work, the management district focused on the following four points:
    (1) Combining specialized production with general production: The Nan Dayuan Management District has 14 production teams and one experimental farm. The experimental farm is responsible for selecting varieties, retaining seed plants, and the production teams are responsible for propagation. The biennial vegetable mother roots are cultivated by the experimental farm, stored uniformly over the winter, and distributed to the production teams in a planned way for propagation in the spring. The original seeds of annual vegetables are propagated by the experimental farm and supplied to the production teams for sowing. In order to avoid cross-pollination and hybridization, one variety is concentrated in one production team, or several adjacent production teams, for propagation. This method of specialized production of mother roots or original seeds by the experimental farm, and propagation of seeds for general production by the production teams, is a good way to improve vegetable quality and increase quantity.
    (2) Combining large-plant seed retention with small-plant propagation: Biennial vegetables, such as radishes, cabbage, kohlrabi, mustard greens, celery, and lettuce, were previously propagated using the large-plant seed retention method. Although the seeds were better, the cost was high, and the number propagated was small, which could not meet the needs of production. Since adopting the method of combining large-plant seed retention with small-plant propagation, this problem has been solved. The method of small-plant propagation started with cabbage and has been developed in 1959. In addition to cabbage, more than 30 kinds of vegetables have adopted this method. For example, radish propagation was formerly done solely by retaining large plants for seed. Only 500 to 600, at most 1,000, mother plants could be selected and retained on one mu of land. Moreover, the mother plants were sown early, often competing with vegetable production for labor and land. After adopting the method of combining large-plant seed retention with small-plant propagation, 20,000 mother plants can be selected per mu, an increase of more than 20 times compared to large-plant seed collection. This is a method of propagating vegetable seeds that is more, faster, better, and more economical.
    (3) Combining selection and breeding of superior varieties with the introduction of superior varieties: This management district constantly pays attention to selecting the best from the best. Regardless of whether it is the experimental farm or the production team, if a mutant plant is discovered, it is immediately marked, strengthened management is carried out, and single harvests and single storage are adopted, and separate cultivation is carried out in the following year, and then selection is continued to cultivate new varieties. Now, four excellent varieties of heading cabbage, four varieties of cowpeas, and varieties of cucumbers and other vegetables have been selected. In terms of variety introduction, after comparative variety trials, those that perform well are propagated in large quantities and promoted to large-field production.
    (4) Combining science and technology with the experience of veteran farmers: The veteran commune members of the Nan Dayuan Management District have extremely rich experience in vegetable seed retention. Combining these veteran farmers' experiences with scientific breeding methods is very beneficial to vegetable seed collection work. For example, artificial auxiliary pollination for cucumbers can improve seed quality and quantity; timely topping of cabbage and kohlrabi can promote seed fullness; and the use of hybrid first-generation seeds of radishes and other advanced technologies; practice has proven that the effect is very good.
    The Nan Dayuan Management District plans to further expand the vegetable seed retention area this year, adopting 2,500 mu for large-plant seed retention and 1,300 mu for small-plant seed retention, more than doubling the seed retention area compared to last year.

### 贯彻执行自繁自选自留自用为主调剂为辅方针  南大园管理区菜种自给有余  去年产蔬菜七千万斤，菜种除自用外调出九万斤

    贯彻执行自繁自选自留自用为主调剂为辅方针
    南大园管理区菜种自给有余
    去年产蔬菜七千万斤，菜种除自用外调出九万斤
    本报讯　河北省保定市南关人民公社南大园管理区，种植蔬菜的面积占总播种面积的60％以上，年产蔬菜约七千五百万斤，有七十六个品种、三十五种蔬菜。1959年蔬菜除自用外，还为省内、外四十四个单位繁殖了四十六个品种，调出种子约九万斤。
    南大园管理区能够取得这样大的成绩，主要是坚持了政治挂帅，贯彻执行了“四自一辅”（自繁、自选、自留、自用，辅之以调剂）种子工作方针的结果。在具体工作上，管理区着重抓住了以下四点：
    （一）专业生产与一般生产相结合：南大园管理区有十四个生产队和一个试验场，试验场负责选品种，留种株，生产队负责繁殖。对两年生的蔬菜母根，由试验场培育，统一贮藏过冬，开春定植时，有计划的分配给各生产队繁殖；对一年生菜类的原种，由试验场繁殖，供给各生产队播种。为了避免串花杂交，采取一个品种集中在一个生产队，或邻近的几个生产队内繁殖。这种由试验场专业生产母根或原种，生产队繁殖一般生产上用的种子，是提高蔬菜质量、增多数量的好办法。
    （二）大株留种与小株繁殖相结合：两年生的蔬菜，如萝卜、洋白菜、苤蓝、芥菜、芹菜、莴笋等，过去是用大株留种方法繁殖的，种子虽然比较好，但成本高，繁殖数量少，不能满足生产需要。自从采用大株留种小株繁殖的方法后，就解决了这个问题。小株繁殖的方法，是从白菜开始的，1959年又有了发展，除白菜外已有三十多种蔬菜都采用这种方法。例如从前繁殖萝卜是单用大株留种的，在一亩地上只能选留母株五百至六百个，最多一千个；而且母株播种早，常和蔬菜生产争劳力、争土地。采用大株留种与小株繁殖相结合方法后，每亩可选母株两万个，比大株采种增加二十倍以上。这是一条多、快、好、省的繁殖菜种的方法。
    （三）选育良种与引进良种相结合：这个管理区经常注意从优中选优，不管试验场或生产队，发现了变异株，立即插上标记，加强管理，并采取单收、单藏、次年单独培育，然后继续选择，以培育新的品种。现在已选出结球甘兰优良品种四个，豇豆四个，还有黄瓜等品种。在引种方面经过品种比较试验，表现良好的，就大量的繁殖，推广到大田生产中去。
    （四）科学技术与老农经验相结合：南大园管理区的老社员，对蔬菜留种有极其丰富的经验，这些老农经验当与科学育种方法结合后，对蔬菜采种工作很有好处。例如黄瓜用人工辅助授粉，可以提高种子质量和数量；白菜、甘兰及时打顶可以促进种子饱满度，以及利用萝卜的杂交一代种等先进技术；经过实践证明，效果都很好。
    南大园管理区今年计划再扩大蔬菜留种面积，采用大株留种二千五百亩，小株留种一千三百亩，比去年留种面积增加了两倍多。
