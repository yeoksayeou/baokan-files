Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, February 5th: Burmese Federal Deputy Prime Minister U Lun Baw received the head of the Chinese Cultural Friendship Delegation, Chu Tunan, deputy heads Zhao Puchu and Lin Lin, and the leaders of the Chinese National Song and Dance Ensemble here this afternoon.

During the friendly talks, Deputy Prime Minister U Lun Baw spoke about the great significance of concluding the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the agreement on the boundary issue between the two countries. He said that this shows that the friendly relations between Burma and China have entered a new stage. He pointed out that this treaty and agreement have received enthusiastic support from international public opinion.

U Lun Baw praised the achievements made by the Chinese people in all aspects over the past ten years.

U Lun Baw also congratulated the Chinese National Song and Dance Ensemble on the success of their performances in Rangoon. He said that Chinese songs and dances have aroused great interest among the citizens of the Burmese capital.

Chu Tunan, as well as other leaders of the Chinese Cultural Friendship Delegation and the National Song and Dance Ensemble, visited Burmese Foreign Minister U Chan Tun Aung yesterday. During the talks, U Chan Tun Aung pointed out that the signing of the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the agreement on the boundary issue between the two governments, as well as the friendly visit of the Chinese Cultural Friendship Delegation and the National Song and Dance Ensemble to Burma, will further strengthen and consolidate the friendship between the two countries. The Burmese Foreign Minister believes that under the guidance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Declaration, Asian countries can fully unite to build their countries.

Lei Yang, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in Burma, was present at both receptions.

The Chinese Cultural Friendship Delegation also presented gifts to Deputy Prime Minister U Lun Baw and Foreign Minister U Chan Tun Aung.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 3rd: "Neues Deutschland" published an article written by the newspaper's Beijing correspondent on February 3rd. It pointed out that the recently published Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the agreement on the boundary issue between the two countries are examples to follow. Through these agreements, China and Burma have not only opened a new stage in their relations, but also made a major contribution to peace in Asia.

The article said that the Sino-Burmese agreements confirmed the fears of those who saw their political capital disappearing with the continuous consolidation of peaceful coexistence and unity among Asian countries. The article said that not long ago, imperialist propaganda still held the hope that the border disputes between China and Burma would separate these two countries that have been friendly since ancient times. Precisely because of this, the signing of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the agreement on the boundary issue are even more important.

The article pointed out that the settlement of the Sino-Burmese border issue strongly proves that the most complex problems can be solved if both sides can proceed from the principles of peaceful coexistence.

The article said that the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression is the first treaty of this type signed between two Asian countries. In contrast to the new "security treaty" signed between Japan and the United States not long ago, the purpose of the Sino-Burmese treaty is to safeguard peace in Asia, strengthen the unity of the Asian people, and promote friendly cooperation based on peaceful coexistence.

Xinhua News Agency, February 5th: Jerusalem Israeli District News: Barati, an international commentator for the Israeli "People's Voice," said in an article published on the 4th that the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the agreement on the boundary issue are a blow to those slanderers who smear China, the great Asian socialist country, as an "aggressor."

The article, entitled "China and Burma are Friends and Good Neighbors," said, who would be foolish enough to believe the nonsense that China is pursuing a "provocative" policy towards India?

The article also said that the Sino-Burmese agreement on the boundary issue proves that complex boundary issues can be resolved based on the principles of coexistence.

    缅甸副总理和外长接见我文化代表团领导人 
    赞扬中缅条约　祝贺中国成就
    “新德意志报”、“人民呼声报”指出中缅条约打击了帝国主义的挑拨宣传
    新华社仰光5日电　缅甸联邦副总理吴伦博今天下午在这里接见了中国文化友好代表团团长楚图南、副团长赵朴初和林林以及中国民族歌舞团的领导人。
    在双方进行友好的谈话时，吴伦博副总理谈到缔结中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和关于两国边界问题的协定的重大意义。他说，这说明，缅甸和中国的友好关系已经进入一个新的阶段。他指出，这个条约和协定得到了国际舆论的热烈支持。
    吴伦博赞扬中国人民十年来在各方面所取得的成就。
    吴伦博还祝贺中国民族歌舞团在仰光的演出获得成功。他说，中国的歌舞引起了缅甸首都市民的很大兴趣。
    楚图南以及中国文化友好代表团和民族歌舞团的其他领导人昨天访问了缅甸外交部长吴千吞昂。吴千吞昂在谈话时指出，缅甸和中国两国政府签订友好和互不侵犯条约和关于边界问题的协定以及中国文化友好代表团和民族歌舞团对缅甸的友好访问，一定会进一步加强和巩固两国的友谊。缅甸外交部长认为，在和平共处五项原则和万隆宣言的指导下，亚洲国家完全可以团结起来建设他们的国家。
    中国驻缅甸大使馆临时代办雷扬在两次接见时都在座。
    中国文化友好代表团还向吴伦博副总理和吴千吞昂外交部长赠送了礼物。
    据新华社柏林3日电　“新德意志报”3日发表这家报纸驻北京记者所写的文章。它指出，最近发表的中缅友好和互不侵犯条约以及关于两国边界问题的协定是一个榜样。中缅两国通过这些协议不仅打开了两国关系的新阶段，而且也为亚洲的和平作出了重大的贡献。
    文章说，中缅两国的协议证实了那些看到自己的政治资本正随着亚洲国家和平共处和团结的不断巩固而消失的人们的恐惧。文章说，不久以前，帝国主义的宣传还抱着这样的希望，希望中缅两国之间的边界争端会使这两个自古以来友好的国家分离。正因为如此，中缅友好和互不侵犯条约的签订以及关于两国边界问题的协定就显得更加重要了。
    文章指出，中缅边界问题的解决强烈地证明了，最复杂的问题也能得到解决，如果双方都能从和平共处的原则出发的话。
    文章说，中缅两国的友好和互不侵犯条约是两个亚洲国家签订的第一个这种类型的条约。同不久以前日美两国之间签订的新的“安全条约”相反，中缅条约的目的在于保障亚洲的和平、加强亚洲人民的团结和在和平共处的基础上的友好合作。
    新华社5日讯　耶路撒冷以色列区消息：以色列“人民呼声报”国际评论员巴勒提在4日发表的一篇文章说，中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和关于边界问题的协定，对那些污蔑中国这个伟大的亚洲社会主义国家为“侵略者”的诽谤者是一个打击。
    这篇以“中国和缅甸是朋友和善邻”为题的文章说，现在谁还会愚蠢到相信所谓中国对印度奉行“挑衅”政策的无稽之谈呢？
    文章又说，中缅关于边界问题的协定证明，复杂的边界问题是可以根据共处的原则解决的。
