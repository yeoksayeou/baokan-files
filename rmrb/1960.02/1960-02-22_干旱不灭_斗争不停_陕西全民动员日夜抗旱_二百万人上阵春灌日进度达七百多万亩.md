Drought Will Not Cease, Struggle Will Not Stop
Shaanxi Mobilizes All People Day and Night to Fight Drought
Two Million People Go Into Battle, Daily Spring Irrigation Progress Reaches Over Seven Million Mu

    (Reported by our newspaper) A drought-fighting struggle to seize grain from the heavens is unfolding extensively throughout Shaanxi Province. The current situation on the drought resistance front in Shaanxi Province is very good, the scale of the movement is growing, and the progress is accelerating. The labor force投入into drought resistance in various places has reached more than two million people. In many places, all the people are going into battle, day and night, and the water doesn't stop when people rest. The daily progress of spring irrigation has increased from 700,000 mu before the Spring Festival to 7,520,000 mu. Recently, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, in view of the increasingly serious drought situation, issued an emergency call to the people of the province to mobilize the entire party and all the people to overcome the drought. Party organizations at all levels and the vast number of cadres and members are, according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, trying every possible means to mobilize manpower and materials to strengthen the drought resistance front.

    Hancheng County has 720,000 mu of land that is dry land with no or very few water conservancy facilities. While irrigating the wheat fields with water, the county is carrying out rush irrigation and moisture preservation of the dry land wheat. In order to support drought resistance, many agencies have stopped working, shops have left only a few people to operate, and all rural work has given way. More than 100,000 people in the county have投入 into the drought resistance struggle. Longting Commune divided its forces into three groups. One group specializes in carrying water from wells, rivers, and ditches for irrigation, one group specializes in harrowing and compacting, and one group specializes in weeding and loosening the soil, so as to combine irrigation and moisture preservation.

    The people of Yulin County have taken urgent action. On February 14, 150,000 laborers were dispatched, fighting for a day, carrying ice to moisten the fields and carrying water to irrigate 5,000 mu of wheat fields. More than 5,000 workers from urban factories and mines, government cadres, officers and soldiers, students, and citizens fully supported the nearby communes. The people of the county, with the determination of "carry ice if there is ice, carry water if there is water, every drop of water returns to the field, and sweeping snow returns to the field," have carried ice, irrigated, and top-dressed all 117,000 mu of wheat fields in the county once, and weeded, harrowed, compacted, and loosened the soil for moisture preservation after irrigation to ensure irrigation quality.

    The Xixiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the local specific conditions, has formulated a water storage and water use plan: (1) Adhering to the principle of using groundwater first, then surface water; using living water first, then stagnant water; using low water first, then high water, and taking measures such as digging sandbars, connecting seepage flow, lifting water, scooping water, blocking water, and diverting water to make full use of water sources. (2) All water conservancy facilities, except for those that must guarantee water for rice transplanting due to insufficient water sources, should immediately open the gates to release water; new projects should quickly improve the canal systems at all levels; projects under construction should be used while being repaired, using them in one place when they are repaired, and using them in one section when they are repaired. (3) Improve irrigation organization, improve irrigation technology, promote shallow ditch irrigation in flat areas, promote horizontal ditch irrigation in hilly areas, and in areas without water sources, mobilize the masses to carry water for irrigation, so as to cherish water and compete for every drop of water. (4) Vigorously grasp water storage, ensure the combination of storage and use, store water as it is used, survey water sources, dredge and expand canals and embankments, connect ponds, reservoirs, canals and embankments with each other, raise the embankments of ponds, intercept every drop of water, and prevent it from flowing away in vain.

    干旱不灭　斗争不停
    陕西全民动员日夜抗旱
    二百万人上阵春灌日进度达七百多万亩
    本报讯　一个与天争粮的抗旱斗争，正在陕西全省广泛展开。当前陕西省抗旱战线上的形势很好，运动规模愈来愈大，进度越来越快。各地投入抗旱的劳力已达二百多万人，很多地方全民上阵，日夜突击，人歇水不停。春灌日进度已由春节前七十万亩，增加到七百五十二万亩。最近中共陕西省委根据旱情日趋严重的情况，已向全省人民发出全党全民紧急动员战胜干旱的号召。各级党的组织和广大干部、社员，正根据省委指示，千方百计调动人力、物力，加强抗旱战线。
    韩城县有七十二万亩地是旱原地，没有或很少有水利设施。这个县在浇灌水地麦子的同时，对旱地麦子进行抢灌和保墒。为了支援抗旱，许多机关停止了办公，商店只留少数人营业，农村一切工作让路，全县有十万多人投入抗旱斗争。龙亭公社分兵三路，一路专门从井里、河里、沟里担水浇灌，一路专门耙耱镇压，一路专门锄草松土，做到浇灌保墒结合。
    榆林县人民已经紧急行动起来。2月14日出动十五万名劳动大军，奋战一天，背冰润田、担水点浇五千亩麦田。城关厂矿工人、机关干部、部队官兵和学生、市民五千多人，全力支援附近各个公社。全县人民以“有冰就背，有水就担，滴水归田，扫雪归田”的决心，对全县十一万七千多亩麦田全部背冰、点浇、追肥一次，浇后锄草、耙耱、镇压一次，松土保墒，确保灌溉质量。
    中共西乡县委根据当地具体情况，制定了蓄水、用水规划：（一）本着先用地下水，后用地上水；先用活水，后用死水；先用低水，后用高水的原则，采取掏沙滩、接渗流，提水、戽水、拦水、引水等办法，充分利用水源。（二）所有水利设施，除因水源不足，必须保证插秧用水外，其余应立即开闸放水；新修工程，迅速健全各级渠系；正施工的工程，边修边用，修好一处用一处，修好一段用一段。（三）健全灌溉组织，提高灌溉技术，平地提倡浅沟浸灌，山坡地推行水平沟灌，无水源的地区，发动群众担水点灌，作到珍惜水量，滴水必争。（四）大抓蓄水，保证蓄用结合，随用随蓄，勘查水源，疏通扩大渠堰，使塘库渠堰相互串通，加高堰塘坎沿，截挡每一滴水，不让白流。（附图片）
