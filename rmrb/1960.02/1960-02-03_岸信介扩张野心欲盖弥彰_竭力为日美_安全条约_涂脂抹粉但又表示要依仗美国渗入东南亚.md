Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 2nd: Tokyo dispatch: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi delivered his first policy address at the regular session of the Japanese Diet on the evening of February 1st after the signing of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. Although he tried his best in this speech to conceal the aggressive nature of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," he made it clear that his government will, in the future, intensify its efforts to serve the U.S.'s aggressive policy in the East, expand into Asia under the guise of "closer cooperation" with the United States, further support the development of monopoly capital domestically, and strengthen fascist rule.

In his speech, Kishi Nobusuke, mimicking the tone of the U.S. imperialists, while lavishly talking about "peace," vigorously promoted the long-bankrupt policy of "strength." He described the situation of the upcoming East-West summit as "arising from the balance of military forces maintained by the East and West relying on collective security systems." He clamored that "free nations still need to maintain their firm determination, unity, and strength."

In order to forcibly pass the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in this Diet session, Kishi Nobusuke tried to whitewash this treaty, which further subjugates Japan to the United States and ties Japan to the U.S. war chariot, in his policy address. He said that the current relationship between the U.S. and Japan is "based on the principles of sovereign equality and mutual cooperation, and the two countries have common interests not only in the political field but also in the economic field." Now, the U.S.-Japan relationship "has completely eliminated some of the postwar colors that have been left behind and has entered a completely new stage." He also self-deceptively said that the view that the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" "runs counter to the direction of easing world tensions is a completely mistaken view of the treaty's true purpose of striving for peace."

In his speech, Kishi Nobusuke expressed his intention to rely on the support of U.S. imperialism to intensify expansion into Asia. He said, "The U.S. and Japan should cooperate more closely in the future to develop Asia"; Japan should "actively participate in international discussions on Asian issues." He expressed his intention to step up "promoting foreign economic cooperation centered on Southeast Asia." He emphasized that Japanese monopoly capital should strengthen its "ability to compete internationally," "modernize equipment, enrich its capital, and rationalize its operations," and so on.

Kishi Nobusuke also expressed his intention to strengthen domestic fascist rule. In his policy address, he attacked Japan's labor movement and mass movements and said bluntly: "The government is determined to take a firm attitude to deal with them."

Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama delivered a foreign policy speech at the meeting. When talking about Japan-China relations, he stated on the one hand that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, "it is gradually achieving achievements in economic construction and other aspects, and we are very willing to recognize this fact," and that China's role in international politics "is also difficult to deny"; but he did not express his readiness to change his policy of hostility toward China. On the contrary, he attacked China's principles on its policy toward Japan, ridiculously demanding that China "take the initiative to eliminate the current obstacles in order to promote Japan-China trade and establish good-neighborly relations."

The February 1st meeting elected Liberal Democratic Party member Ichiro Kiyose as Speaker of the House of Representatives. Former Speaker Ryo Goro Kato was forced to resign due to widespread condemnation for blatantly assisting Nobusuke Kishi in carrying out fascist suppression within the Diet.

### 岸信介扩张野心欲盖弥彰  竭力为日美“安全条约”涂脂抹粉但又表示要依仗美国渗入东南亚

    岸信介扩张野心欲盖弥彰
    竭力为日美“安全条约”涂脂抹粉但又表示要依仗美国渗入东南亚
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介1日晚在日本国会平时会议上发表了签订日美军事同盟条约以后的第一次施政演说。虽然他在这篇演说中竭力掩饰新日美“安全条约”的侵略本质，但是他表明，他的政府今后对外将在同美国“更加密切地合作”的名义下加紧为美国在东方的侵略政策效劳，向亚洲进行扩张，对内将进一步扶助垄断资本发展，加强法西斯统治。
    岸信介在演说中学着美帝国主义者的腔调，在侈谈“和平”的同时，竭力鼓吹早已破产了的“实力地位”政策，他把不久将要召开东西方高级会议的形势，说成“是在东西方依靠集体安全保障体系保持军事力量的平衡的情况下产生的”。他叫嚣“自由国家仍然需要保持自己的坚强决心、团结和力量”。
    为了在这次国会会议上强行通过新的日美“安全条约”，岸信介在施政演说中为这项使日本进一步屈从美国和把日本捆上美国战车的条约涂脂抹粉。他说，目前日美两国的关系是“根据主权平等和互相合作的原则建立起来的，两国不光在政治方面，而且在经济方面也同样地有着共同的利益”。现在，日美关系“已经完全消除遗留到目前的一些战后色彩，而进入了完全新的阶段”。他还自欺欺人地说什么那种认为新日美“安全条约”“同缓和世界紧张局势的方向背道而驰的看法，是完全认错了本条约争取和平的真正目的的看法”。
    岸信介在演说中表示今后要依仗美帝国主义撑腰加紧向亚洲扩张。他说，“日美两国今后应该更加密切地合作，以便使亚洲发展”；日本要“积极地参加关于亚洲问题的国际性讨论”。他表示要加紧“促进以东南亚为中心的对外经济合作”。他强调，日本垄断资本要加强“在国际上进行竞争的能力”，“使设备现代化，充实自己的资本，使经营合理化”等等。
    岸信介还表示要加强国内的法西斯统治。他在施政演说中攻击日本的工人运动和群众运动，并且露骨地说：“政府已经决心采取坚决的态度对付他们”。
    日本外相藤山爱一郎在会议上发表了外交政策演说。在谈到日中关系时，他一方面表示，中华人民共和国建国以来“在经济建设和其他方面，正在逐步地取得成就，我们很愿意承认这个事实”，中国在国际政治方面的作用“也很难否认”；但是他并没有表示准备改变敌视中国的政策，相反地，他攻击中国对日政策的原则，居然荒谬地要中国“主动地努力消除目前的障碍，以便促进日中贸易和建立睦邻关系”。
    1日的会议选出了自由民主党议员清濑一郎为众议院议长。前任议长加藤镣五郎由于露骨地帮助岸信介在国会内进行法西斯压制受到普遍的谴责而被迫辞职。
