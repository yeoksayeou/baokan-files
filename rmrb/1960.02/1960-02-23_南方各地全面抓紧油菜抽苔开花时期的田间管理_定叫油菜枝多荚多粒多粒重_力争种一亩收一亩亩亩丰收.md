Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd. The rape plants in the southern regions are now entering the crucial period of bolting, budding, and flowering. In some areas of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and other provinces and regions, the early rape fields are already a sea of golden yellow. Currently, people's communes everywhere are intensifying field management practices such as topdressing, intertillage and soil cultivation, ditching and drainage, and pest and disease control, striving for more branches, more flowers, more pods, and aiming to reap a harvest from every mu planted, achieving a bumper harvest on every mu.

The expanded planting area of ​​rape is the foundation for striving for a rapeseed harvest this year. Sichuan and other places have also mobilized the masses to use small plots of land to cultivate many single "Rape King" plants. In addition, the early and intensive management of rape fields in various places last winter has resulted in generally good growth of rape plants, with thick stalks and lush leaves. According to reports from various places, the second-class seedlings of rape in many regions this year have caught up with the first-class seedlings of last year, and the third-class seedlings have caught up with the second-class seedlings of last year. In particular, the Victory improved variety of rape planted in various places is growing especially vigorously. For example, in Hunan Province, first-class and second-class rape seedlings account for about 95%, and third-class seedlings account for only about 5%.

Various places are now further grasping field management such as topdressing for rape, to ensure that the rape plants successfully pass the bolting and flowering stages. To date, rape fields across the country have generally been topdressed once, and more than half have been topdressed twice. In early February, more than 90% of the rape fields in Sichuan Province had been topdressed twice, more than 70% had been topdressed three times, and more than 50% had been topdressed four times. Rape fields in Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang and other provinces have also generally been topdressed twice. This level of sufficient fertilization is rare in previous years. In Wuhu Prefecture, Anhui Province, there were more than 270,000 mu of third-class rape seedlings. After intertillage and topdressing, the third-class seedlings have been basically eliminated, and more than 180,000 mu have caught up with the first-class seedlings. People's communes in Suzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, are currently ditching and draining water, and topdressing and weeding the rape fields.

In this critical period of rape growth, many areas have further strengthened leadership, enriched and expanded the rape field management teams, and launched field management competitions. Party committees at all levels in Hunan Province have established winter crop headquarters or leading groups to lead rape production. The Songzi County Committee in Hubei Province also summarized the experience of Gaochan Fengshou's annual rape planting in the Dalukou Management District of the Babao Commune and promoted it throughout the county. According to the experience of the Dalukou Management District, all communes in the county immediately launched rape cultivation and management activities centered on topdressing, frost prevention, pest control, and soil loosening, which greatly promoted the upgrading of rape fields throughout the county. Yichun Prefecture in Jiangxi Province also launched a rape overproduction competition, and all counties are stepping up weeding and topdressing. Hukou County has recently transferred a large number of laborers to set up camps in rape fields. Xindu County in Sichuan has launched a "three increases and one weight" campaign to increase branches, pods, grains, and grain weight. Currently, each rape plant in the county generally has six to seven more branches than in the same period last year.

In order to ensure a greater increase in rape production this year, the Ministry of Agriculture recently issued a special notice, requiring all localities to: 1. Effectively grasp the guaranteed harvest area of ​​rape. Field management and topdressing should also be stepped up in poorly growing rape fields in an effort to increase production, and should not be plowed up casually. Those that conflict with the planting of early rice must be carefully investigated and properly arranged to avoid plowing up as much as possible. Plowing up one mu of rape field must be approved by the county. 2. Grasp fertilization to ensure that the rape plants are well-fed. All localities must thoroughly investigate the fertilization situation of rape fields since sowing and the preparation for topdressing. Not only should high-yielding fields be investigated, but also general fields should be investigated. If the preparation for topdressing is insufficient, immediate measures should be taken to solve it. (Attached picture)

### 南方各地全面抓紧油菜抽苔开花时期的田间管理  定叫油菜枝多荚多粒多粒重  力争种一亩收一亩亩亩丰收

    南方各地全面抓紧油菜抽苔开花时期的田间管理
    定叫油菜枝多荚多粒多粒重
    力争种一亩收一亩亩亩丰收
    新华社22日讯　南方各地的油菜生长已经进入抽苔现蕾开花的关键时期，四川、云南、广东、广西等省区部分地区的早油菜田已经一片金黄。现在各地的人民公社正在抓紧进行追肥、中耕培土、开沟排渍和防治病虫等田间管理工作，争取油菜多分枝、多开花、多结荚，并力争种一亩收一亩，亩亩丰收。
    各地油菜种植面积扩大是今年争取菜籽丰收的基础，四川各地还发动群众利用零星小块土地培育了很多单株的“油菜王”。加上去冬各地对油菜田管理工作抓得早，抓得紧，现在油菜普遍生长良好，秆粗叶肥。据各地反映，今年许多地区油菜的二类苗已赶上了去年的一类苗，三类苗赶上了去年的二类苗。特别是各地种植的胜利良种油菜生长得格外旺盛。例如湖南省的油菜一、二类苗占95％左右，三类苗只占5％左右。
    各地现正进一步大抓油菜追肥等田间管理，保证油菜过好抽苔、开花关。到目前为止，全国油菜田已普遍追过一遍肥，追施过两遍肥的占一半以上。四川省2月上旬已有90％以上的油菜田追过两次肥，70％以上追过三次肥，50％以上追过四次肥。湖南、江西、浙江等省的油菜田也普遍追肥两次。施肥充足，这是往年极少有的。安徽省芜湖专区的油菜原有三类苗二十七万多亩，经过中耕追肥以后，三类苗已基本消灭，并且有十八万多亩赶上了一类苗。江苏省苏州专区各人民公社正在给油菜田开沟排水和追肥除草。
    许多地区在油菜生长的这个关键时期，都进一步加强了领导，充实和扩大了油菜田间管理队伍，并开展了田间管理竞赛运动。湖南省各级党委都成立了越冬作物指挥部或领导小组，领导油菜生产。湖北省松滋县委还总结了八宝公社大路口管理区种植油菜年年高产丰收的经验，在全县范围内加以推广。全县各公社都根据大路口管理区的经验，立即开展了以追肥、防冻、治虫、松土为中心的油菜培育管理活动，大大地促进了全县油菜田的升级。江西省宜春专区还开展了油菜超产的竞赛，各县都在加紧锄草追肥。湖口县最近还抽调了大批劳动力到油菜田安营扎寨。四川新都县开展了油菜增枝、增荚、增粒、粒重的“三增一重”运动，现在全县油菜一般每株都比去年同期增加六到七个分枝。
    为了保证今年油菜生产有较大的增长，最近农业部特别发出通知，要求各地：一、切实抓紧油菜保收面积。生长不够好的菜田也要抓紧田间管理，追施肥料，争取增产，不要随便犁掉。与种早稻有矛盾的要认真查清，妥当安排，尽可能避免犁掉。犁掉一亩菜田必须经过县的同意。二、抓紧施肥，让油菜吃饱。各地要切实查清菜田从播种以来的施肥情况和追肥准备情况。不仅丰产田要查清，一般田也要查清。追肥准备不足的要立即设法解决。（附图片）
