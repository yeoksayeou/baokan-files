    Beijing Refractory Materials Factory Construction Site Breaks Through a Weak Link in the Construction Industry
    Semi-Mechanized Construction Site Transportation
    Workers only need to press a button, pull a handle, or crank a simple earth winch to send bricks, tiles, mortar, and steel bars to where they are needed.
    (Our report) The strong laborers at the Beijing Refractory Materials Factory construction site, after vigorously pursuing mechanized and semi-mechanized handling, have put down their carrying poles and baskets, and are operating various machines to transport construction materials. Work efficiency has increased by two to seven times compared to manual handling. Over the past year, the ratio of technicians to strong laborers has decreased from 1:1.5 to 1:0.7, saving a total of more than 70,000 workdays. According to the original plan, to ensure the timely completion of this construction project with an area of over 49,000 square meters, it would have been necessary to add 300 strong laborers and six winches. After implementing semi-mechanized handling, 150 workers were instead released to support the construction of other projects.
    At this construction site, transporting materials has become an easy and enjoyable task. Workers only need to press a button, pull a handle, or crank an earth winch, and these self-made, simple handling machines will quickly send bricks, tiles, sand, stone, mortar, and steel bars to where they are needed. Previously, strong laborers transported construction materials on the ground by carrying them on their shoulders or pushing them in small carts. Now, this construction site has adopted railcar transportation. The strong laborers simply stand on the car and pull the gate, and the motor installed on the front of the car pulls several cars of construction materials away.
    Transporting construction materials from the ground to high places was originally the most labor-intensive and tiring handling task, requiring strong laborers to carry or shoulder materials, walk across narrow scaffolding boards, and deliver them to the technicians. Now, when transporting small quantities of materials over short distances, they use simple cable transportation tools and monorail aerial transportation tools, both of which are three times more efficient than manual transportation. These two types of tools use steel wire ropes or lightweight rails, which are erected at an angle from the ground loading point to the construction site, with wooden boxes and iron buckets for loading materials, and hand-cranked earth winches as power for pulling. Using these two types of tools can save two-thirds of the labor force and is very safe. When transporting large quantities of materials over long distances, the "slope series transportation" method is adopted, using a winch as power to pull four-wheeled carts, carrying materials along a slope made of wooden planks to high places. At most, it can pull twelve carts at a time, transporting more than 860 bricks. In the past, transporting construction materials from distant storage locations to high places generally involved people pushing carts to transport the materials from the loading location to the bottom of the building, and then using a winch to carry the hoppers to high places. Now, the implementation of "slope series transportation" allows for direct transportation from the loading location to high places, saving a transportation process and increasing efficiency by three times. The workers also created a series vertical transportation method where one winch drives twelve hoppers to transport simultaneously, which not only improves efficiency but also fully utilizes the potential of the winch.
    The handling machinery on this construction site also includes "electric slope loading cars" that replace people pushing carts to transport raw materials to the back of the concrete mixer, and "abacus-style brick sliders" used to transport bricks and tiles from high places to the bottom when repairing basements.
    The workers at this construction site vigorously promoted mechanized and semi-mechanized handling, adopting the methods of making do with whatever is available, self-reliance, and combining indigenous and foreign methods. All workers contributed ideas and suggestions, and technical innovation groups and amateur processing plants were established. When there was no steel, hardwood was used instead; when there were no pulleys, they cast them themselves. They overcame many difficulties in every possible way, and in just over two months, they manufactured more than 300 pieces of horizontal and vertical transportation handling tools that cost little money, saved materials, were highly efficient, and easy to operate. After the simple machinery was made, the construction site party organization promptly mobilized the masses to select, finalize, and promote them in a coordinated manner.
    The Beijing basic construction leadership department attached great importance to the experience of this construction site in vigorously promoting mechanized handling by strong laborers, and recently held an on-site meeting here, calling on all construction sites in the city to vigorously promote these simple handling machines, break through the weak link of construction site transportation, and liberate thousands of strong laborers from heavy manual labor.

    北京耐火材料厂工地突破建筑业一个薄弱环节
    工地运输半机械化
    工人只要一按电钮、一扳把手或是一摇土卷扬机简易机械就能把砖瓦、灰浆、钢筋送到需要的地方
    本报讯　北京耐火材料厂工地的壮工经过大闹搬运机械化半机械化，放下了扁担和大筐，开动着各种机械搬运建筑材料，工作效率比人工搬运提高二倍到七倍。一年来，技工和壮工的比例，从一比一点五下降到一比零点七，总共节约了七万多个劳动日。按照原来的计划，这一建筑面积达四万九千多平方米的工程，要保证工程如期竣工，还需要增添三百名壮工和六台卷扬机；实现搬运半机械化以后，反而抽出了一百五十名工人去支援其他工程的建设。
    在这个工地上，搬运材料已经成为轻松愉快的工作。工人们只要一按电钮、一扳把手或者一摇土卷扬机，那些自制的简易搬运机械，就会迅速地把砖、瓦、砂、石、灰浆和钢筋送到需要的地方。从前，壮工们在地面运送建筑材料，都是手搬肩挑或是用小车推送。现在，这个工地采取了轨道列车运输，壮工们只要站在车上扳动闸门，装在车头上的马达就拖着几节小车把建筑材料运走。
    从地面向高处运送建筑材料，原是工作量最大而且最累的一项搬运工作，需要壮工挑着或扛着材料，走过狭长的脚手板，送到技工的身旁。现在，他们运送数量小运距近的材料时，采用简易的缆索运输工具和单轨空中运输工具，效率都比人力运送提高了三倍。这两种工具是用钢丝绳或是轻便轨道，从地面放料地点斜着架空连到施工地点，以木箱、铁桶装料，用手摇的土卷扬机作动力拉运。采用这两种工具，可以节省三分之二的劳动力，而且十分安全。在运送数量大运距远的材料时，采取“斜坡连串运输”的方法，利用卷扬机作动力拉着四轮小车，把材料沿着用木板杉槁搭成的斜坡送到高处，一次最多能拉十二节车，运送八百六十多块砖。过去，从较远的存料地点向高处运送建筑材料，一般都先由人推小车把料从装料地点运到建筑物底下，然后由卷扬机带着吊斗往高处运送。现在，实行“斜坡连串运输”，可以从装料地点一直运送到高处，节省了一道运输工序，效率提高三倍。工人们还创造了一台卷扬机带动十二个吊斗同时运输的连串垂直运输法，不仅提高了效率，而且充分发挥了卷扬机的潜力。
    这个工地的搬运机械还有代替人推小车向混凝土搅拌机后台运送原料的“电动斜坡上料车”，修地下室时从高处往下运砖瓦用的“算盘式滑砖器”等。
    这个工地的工人大搞搬运机械化和半机械化，采取了因陋就简，自力更生，土洋结合的办法。工人们人人献计献策，成立了技术革新小组和业余加工厂。没有钢铁，就用硬木代替；没有滑轮，就自己动手铸造。他们千方百计地克服了许多困难，在短短的两个多月内，就制造出三百多件花钱少、用料省、效率高、操作容易的水平运输和垂直运输的搬运工具。简易机械制成以后，工地党组织便及时发动群众选型、定型配套推广。
    北京基本建设领导部门十分重视这个工地大闹壮工搬运机械化的经验，最近在这里召开了现场会议，号召全市各个工地大力推广这些简易的搬运机械，突破工地运输这一薄弱环节，把成千上万的壮工从笨重的体力劳动中解放出来。
