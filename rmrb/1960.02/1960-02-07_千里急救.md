Urgent Rescue Over a Thousand Miles
Yang Shujiang

Emergency Aid Requested from Afar

At four o'clock in the afternoon on February 3rd, the telephone at the Bamiantao Special Medicine Store rang urgently. Hu Chunlin, a salesman, answered the phone and heard an anxious voice: "I am from the Pinglu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province. We have an emergency and need your support: The road maintenance workers of the Pinglu County Road Engineering Team have suffered from food poisoning. We don't have the specific medicine here. Please send us 1,000 ampules of injection as soon as possible. We hope you can send it by plane, the faster the better." The call was made personally by Hao Shishan, the Secretary of the Pinglu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

The Special Medicine Store immediately reported the situation to Lin Peizhi, the Deputy Manager of the Beijing Pharmaceutical Purchasing and Supply Station. Deputy Manager Lin Peizhi instructed them to do everything possible to get the medicine to the patients. The store's Party branch immediately formed an emergency supply team. Based on past experience, they first contacted transportation. The phone call went to the Beijing Railway Station, but the station replied that it would take 48 hours to transport the medicine to Pinglu County, which was too slow. The phone then went to the Civil Aviation Administration, whose comrades said: There is a flight to Taiyuan tomorrow morning, but Taiyuan is still a thousand miles away from Pinglu County, and it would take another two days for land transportation.

Air Force Dispatches Special Plane

The employees of the Special Medicine Store thought that saving people is like fighting a fire. They must not let the lives of class brothers be endangered due to the untimely supply of medicine. They must do everything possible to deliver the medicine to the patients in time. Five or six salesmen acted together, contacting more than a dozen units in the city, trying to find a special plane to send the medicine directly to the scene.

The Ministry of Health also learned about the situation, and they were also contacting various places for a plane. Through the joint efforts of both parties, they finally found a unit of the Air Force. The leaders of the Air Force unit immediately decided to send a special plane to deliver the medicine to the scene.

Cleverly Install Lights on Medicine Box

A plane was found, but Pinglu County had no airport, so the plane could not land. If the medicine were airdropped, according to calculations, the plane would arrive in Pinglu County in the middle of the night. If there were no lights on the medicine box, it would be difficult to find at night. The employees of the Special Medicine Store immediately requested support from the employees of the Wuzhou Electrical Appliance Store in Bamiantao, asking them to install lights around the medicine box for easy searching at night. Upon hearing the news, the employees of the Wuzhou Electrical Appliance Store put down their bowls and gave up the movie that night, immediately studying how to install the lights properly. Yang Fusen and Zhou Shiling, two directors, and two employees worked while researching and producing, sweating profusely. After 30 minutes of hard work, they had a stroke of genius and installed a battery light on each side of the medicine box. This light was equipped with four dry batteries. In this way, when airdropped, there would be light on no matter which side of the box landed. The employees of the Special Medicine Store were worried that 1,000 ampules of injection would not be enough, so they specially packed another 1,000 ampules, shipped them to Zhengzhou, and then transferred them to Pinglu County via the Longhai Railway.

Medicine Delivered in Time

At 9:04, just over five hours after the Special Medicine Store received the phone call, a majestic eagle of the motherland cut through the quiet night sky, fully loaded with the care of the Party and Chairman Mao, carrying the friendship between the army and the people and the noble feelings of class brothers, flying like lightning to Pinglu County, Shanxi Province, more than 2,000 miles away from Beijing. As soon as the plane took off, the Special Medicine Store made a phone call there, asking them to send someone to pick it up.

At 11:30, the medicine was safely airdropped to its destination.

At midnight, the Pinglu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party had sent people to find the emergency medicine sent by the people of the capital.

All Patients Out of Danger

On the evening of the 4th, the employees of the Special Medicine Store made a phone call to Pinglu County to express their condolences. The Secretary of the Pinglu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party told them: "More than sixty poisoned patients have all been out of danger after being injected with the medicine, and some have even asked to go to the fields to work."

After the medicine was delivered, the Pinglu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party broadcast this matter to the people of the whole county. The local people were very moved and greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses for production. They said: If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, these people would have lost their lives. They expressed that they must answer the care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao and thank the enthusiastic support of the people of the capital with greater enthusiasm and outstanding achievements.

    千里急救
    杨树茳
    远地紧急求援
    2月3日下午四点钟，八面槽特种药品商店的电话，响起了急促的铃声，业务员胡春林接过电话，里面传来了焦急的声音：“我是中共山西平陆县委，有一件紧急的事情请求你们支援：平陆县养路工程队的民工发生了食物中毒事故，这里没有特效药，请你们马上支援注射剂一千支。希望用飞机送来，越快越好。”电话是中共平陆县委书记郝世山亲自打来的。
    特种药品商店将这一情况立即向北京医药采购供应站林培植副经理汇报。林培植副经理指示他们，想尽一切办法，将药品送到患者身边。商店党支部马上成立了紧急供应小组。根据以往的经验，他们首先联系运输工具。电话通向北京火车站，车站答复：将药品运到平陆县，需四十八个小时，速度太慢了。电话又通向民航局，民航局的同志说：明天上午有一班机飞往太原，但太原离平陆县仍有一千里地，再经陆地转运，也需要两天的时间。
    空军派出专机
    特种药品商店的职工们想，救人如救火，决不能因药品供应不及时而让阶级兄弟有性命危险，一定想尽一切办法将药品及时送到患者身边。五、六个业务员一齐行动起来，和本市十几个单位进行联系，想找一架专机，将药品直接送到出事地点。
    卫生部也知道了这个情况，他们也正在和各处联系飞机。在双方共同努力下，他们最后找到了空军某部。空军某部领导同志立刻决定，派一架专机，把药品送到出事地点。
    药箱巧装电灯
    飞机有了，但平陆县没有飞机场，飞机不能降落。如果进行空投，根据计算，飞机到达平陆县正值深夜，药箱上如果没有灯光标志，夜间是不易找到的。特种药品商店职工，立即请求八面槽五洲电料行职工支援，要求在药箱的四周安装灯光便于夜间寻找。五洲电料行职工听到这一消息，放下饭碗，放弃了当晚的电影，立刻研究如何把灯光安好。杨福森、周世玲两位主任和两名职工边研究边制作，累的满头大汗，经过三十分钟的苦干，他们急中生智，在药箱的四周一边安上一个电池灯，这个灯配有四个干电池。这样，空投时，无论箱子哪一边着地，都会有灯光发亮。特种药品商店职工深怕一千支注射药不够，特别另装了一千支，运发郑州再经陇海铁路转运到平陆县。药品及时送到
    九点零四分，距特种药品商店接到电话后仅仅五个多小时，一架祖国的雄鹰，划破了宁静的夜空，满载着党和毛主席的关怀，载着军民情谊和阶级兄弟的高尚情感，风驰电掣般飞往远距北京两千多里的山西平陆县。飞机刚刚起飞，特种药品商店就给那里打了一个电话，让他们派人接取。
    十一点三十分，药品安全地空投到目的地。
    深夜十二点，中共平陆县委已派人将首都人民送去的急救药品找到。患者全部脱险
     4日晚上，特种药品商店职工为了表示慰问，给平陆县打了一个电话，中共平陆县委书记向他们说：“六十多名中毒病人，经过注射药品后，已全部脱离危险，有的已经要求下地生产。”
    药品送到后，中共平陆县委向全县人民通过广播宣传了这个事情。当地群众非常感动，大大鼓舞了群众的生产热情。他们说：要不是共产党和毛主席，就没有这些人的生命了。他们表示一定要以更大的干劲和出色的成绩，回答党中央和毛主席的关怀，答谢首都人民的热情支援。（原载“北京晚报”）
