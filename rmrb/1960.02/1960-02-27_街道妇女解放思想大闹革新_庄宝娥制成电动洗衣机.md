Street Women Liberate Thinking, Vigorously Revolutionize
Zhuang Bao'e Makes Electric Washing Machine
    (Our report) Shanghai Jing'an District, Zhangjiazhai neighborhood's laundry group's housewife, Zhuang Bao'e, broke down superstitions, liberated her thinking, and used local methods to successfully trial-produce an electric washing machine. This machine can wash thirty pieces of clothing in half an hour, which is eight to nine times faster than by hand.
    Zhuang Bao'e is a forty-year-old worker's family member with six children who only knows a few characters. In the past, she was busy all day cooking, buying groceries, and taking care of children. Since the neighborhood was organized, she has participated in social labor, taking on laundry, sewing, and other work, and is very active. Last autumn, as the neighborhood's collective life and welfare undertakings developed, more and more clothes needed washing, and the four or five sisters in the laundry group were busy from morning to night and still couldn't keep up. So she wanted to make a washing machine.
    At first, Zhuang Bao'e also thought that since she had neither technology nor education, how could she carry out innovation? But she finally mustered the courage, and after many nights of hard work, with the help of the district party branch and workers from the machine factory, she successfully made an electric washing machine.
    After the washing machine was made, the sisters in the laundry group were extremely happy. They held Zhuang Bao'e's hand tightly and said excitedly: We housewives can also engage in innovation, which is only possible when we are organized. Zhuang Bao'e's innovation also shattered the superstitious thinking of the housewives in Zhangjiazhai, and they have successively made many tools.

    街道妇女解放思想大闹革新
    庄宝娥制成电动洗衣机
    本报讯　上海静安区张家宅里弄洗衣组的家庭妇女庄宝娥，破除迷信，解放思想，用土法试制成功一台电动洗衣机。用这种机器半小时能洗三十件衣服，比手工快八九倍。
    庄宝娥是个四十多岁的工人家属，有六个孩子，只认得几个字，过去整天忙着烧饭、买小菜、带孩子。自从里弄组织起来以后，她参加了社会劳动，担任洗衣、缝衣等工作，非常积极。去年秋天，里弄集体生活福利事业日益发展，洗的衣服愈来愈多，洗衣组的四五个姊妹从早洗到晚，还是忙不过来，于是她就想制造一台洗衣机。
    庄宝娥一开始也曾想过自己既无技术又无文化，搞革新怎能行？但她终于鼓起勇气，经过多少个夜晚的刻苦钻研，在地区党总支和机厂的工人的帮助下，做成功电动洗衣机。
    这台洗衣机制成后，洗衣组的姐妹都高兴异常，她们紧握着庄宝娥的手，激动地说：我们家庭妇女也能搞革新，这只有组织起来才有可能。庄宝娥的这一个革新，也打破了张家宅家庭妇女的迷信思想，她们接连搞成了许多工具。
