Xinhua News Agency dispatch: As the Japanese government of Nobusuke Kishi, in disregard of strong protests from people at home and abroad, submitted the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and its related documents to the Diet on February 5, the movement of people from all walks of life in Japan against the Japan-U.S. military alliance has developed more deeply.

The Japan Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee Council meeting issued a statement on February 6, stating that the committee will carry out a resolute struggle against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," against the Japanese government's provision of war reparations to South Vietnam, and against the implementation of a hostile policy towards China under the pretext of "the principle of separating politics from economics."

The statement emphasized that the Asia-Africa solidarity movement is essentially a movement of Asian countries to oppose imperialism and colonialism and strive to get rid of backwardness. The statement said that the highest mission of the Japan Asia-Africa solidarity movement is to fight for Japan's independence and to prevent the revival of Japan's aggressive militarism, because Japan is not only in a state of being semi-occupied by the United States, but it has also committed crimes of aggression against Asian countries in the past.

The Japan Peace Committee issued a statement on February 5 regarding the memorandum submitted by the Soviet government to Japan on the signing of a new military treaty between Japan and the United States, condemning the Kishi Nobusuke government for violating international trust and the Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration.

The statement refuted the absurd propaganda of the Japanese government accusing the Soviet government's memorandum of "violating the Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration and international trust." The statement pointed out that originally, the Habomai Islands and Shikotan Island belonged to the Soviet Union under international agreements, and Japan also announced its abandonment of these islands in the Treaty of San Francisco. In order to satisfy Japan's wishes, the Soviet Union announced in the Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration that it agreed to transfer these islands to Japan after the conclusion of a Japan-Soviet peace treaty. However, since the Japanese government has continuously refused to hold negotiations to conclude a Japan-Soviet peace treaty, it has unreasonably insisted on recovering these islands. Therefore, it is the Japanese government, not the Soviet government, that is violating international trust and the Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration.

The statement pointed out that at present, when the United States and Japan are signing a military treaty directed against the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's demand that U.S. troops withdraw from Japan is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a Japan-Soviet peace treaty, and it is also the substantive content of the treaty.

The Kyoto Buddhist Conference of Japan held a seminar on February 5, believing that the new "Security Treaty" violates the Buddhist desire for peace, and that agreeing to this treaty is a violation of the Buddhist's duty.

The Japan-China Buddhist Exchange Association recently submitted a petition to the Kishi government. The petition stated that Japanese Buddhists guarantee to establish friendly relations with China. Through the exchange of scriptures, doctrines, and personnel for thousands of years, Japanese Buddhism has close ties with Chinese Buddhism. The petition emphasized that Japanese Buddhists feel very sorry for the atrocities committed by Japan in China during the war. The petition warned the Japanese government not to take the wrong approach in its policy towards China at this time.

According to a February 4 report in the "Akahata" (Red Flag) newspaper, the National Federation of Commercial and Industrial Associations of Japan, composed of 80,000 small and medium-sized enterprises, has decided on a struggle policy centered on opposing excessive taxes and preventing the ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The policy emphasized that in carrying out these two struggles, it is necessary to strengthen the unity between member manufacturers and strengthen cooperation with workers. The policy stipulates that, to this end, in coordination with the unified action of workers on the 25th of this month to "Oppose the Security Treaty, Eliminate Unemployment and Poverty," various activities will be launched simultaneously throughout the country to oppose the Diet's ratification of the new "Security Treaty," demand a reduction in excessive taxes, and oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's formulation of reactionary laws that oppress small and medium-sized enterprises.

The Japan Committee for Consoling the Spirits of Chinese Martyrs who Died in Japan decided in a petition to the Kishi government that members of this group are engaged in collecting the remains of Chinese people who died in Japan during the war, holding memorial services for them, and sending their remains back to China. The petition stated that they are doing this because they feel guilty about Japan's past crimes of aggression against China. The petition also stated that the committee has just completed a list of 6,722 Chinese people who died in Japan.

The petition demanded that the government abandon its plan to have the Diet ratify the revised Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and fundamentally change its policy so that it can quickly restore diplomatic relations with China.

    日本人民坚决反对军国主义复活
    日本亚非团结委员会声明坚决反对新的日美条约
    和平委员会支持苏联的备忘录要求美军撤出日本
    佛教徒会议认为“安全条约”违反佛教祈求和平愿望
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：当日本岸信介政府不顾国内外人民的强烈抗议于5日向国会提交新的日美“安全条约”及其有关附件的时候，日本各界人士反对日美军事同盟的运动更加向纵深发展。
    日本亚非团结委员会理事会会议6日发表声明说，委员会将进行坚决的斗争，反对新的日美“安全条约”，反对日本政府向南越提供战争赔偿和反对借口“政治同经济分开的原则”执行敌视中国的政策。
    声明强调说，亚非团结运动本来就是亚洲各国人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取摆脱落后状态的运动。声明说，日本亚非团结运动的最高使命是为日本的独立和为防止日本侵略成性的军国主义的复活而斗争，因为日本现在不仅处于被美国半占领的状态，而且它在过去犯过侵略亚洲国家的罪行。
    日本和平委员会5日就苏联政府就日美签订新军事条约向日本提出的备忘录发表声明，谴责岸信介政府违背国际信义和日苏联合宣言。
    声明驳斥日本政府指责苏联政府备忘录“违背日苏联合宣言和国际信义”的荒谬宣传。声明指出，本来，齿舞群岛和色丹岛由于国际协定规定归属苏联，日本在旧金山和约中也宣布放弃这些岛屿，苏联为了满足日本的愿望，在日苏联合宣言中宣布同意在缔结日苏和约后把这些岛屿移交日本。但是日本政府既然不断拒绝举行缔结日苏和约的谈判，却又无理地坚持要收回这些岛屿。因此违背国际信义和日苏联合宣言的是日本政府而不是苏联政府。
    声明指出，目前，当日美两国签订针对苏联的军事条约的时候，苏联要求美军撤出日本，这是为缔结日苏和约的不可缺少的条件，同时这也是和约的实质上的内容。
    日本京都佛教徒会议5日举行研究会，认为新“安全条约”是违反佛教徒祈求和平的愿望的，对这项条约表示同意就是不守佛教徒的本份。
    日中佛教交流恳谈会最近向岸政府提出了请愿书。请愿书说，日本佛教徒保证同中国建立友好的关系，通过一千年来经文、教义和人员的交流，日本佛教同中国佛教已经有着密切的联系。请愿书强调说，日本佛教徒对于战时日本在中国的暴行，感到非常遗憾。请愿书警告日本政府，在这个时候在关于对中国的政策方面，不要采取错误的方针。
    据“赤旗报”4日报道，由八万家中小企业组成的日本全国商工团体联合会决定了以反对苛捐和阻止批准新日美“安全条约”为中心的斗争方针。
    方针强调指出，在展开这两项斗争时，必须加强会员厂商之间的团结和加强同工人的合作。方针规定，为此，将配合工人在本月25日举行的“反对安全条约、消灭失业和贫困”统一行动，在全国同时展开各种活动，反对国会批准新“安全条约”，要求削减苛捐，反对岸信介政府制定压迫中小企业的反动法律。
    日本的中国殉难烈士慰灵实行委员会决定向岸政府提出的请愿书说，这个团体的成员们正在从事搜集战时在日本牺牲的中国人的遗骸，为他们举行追悼会和把他们的遗骸送回中国。请愿书说，他们这样作是由于对日本过去侵略中国的罪行感到内疚。请愿书又说，这个委员会刚刚完成了一份在日本死亡的六千七百二十二个中国人的名单。
    请愿书要求政府放弃使国会批准经过修改的日美“安全条约”的计划，和从根本上改变它的政策，以便能够迅速地恢复同中国的邦交。
