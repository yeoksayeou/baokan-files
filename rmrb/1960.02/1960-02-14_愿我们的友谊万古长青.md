    May Our Friendship Last Forever
    Prokharenko, Foreman of the Forging Workshop, Kharkov Tractor Plant, USSR
    Not long ago, we Kharkov tractor builders received a precious gift from the People's Republic of China. All the staff and workers of the China First Tractor Plant sent us a red banner. The banner was inscribed with extremely touching words:
    "Dear Comrades! You gave us great help when we built our factory. On the occasion of the factory starting production, we respectfully present this banner to express our gratitude for your help. May the friendship between China and the Soviet Union last forever."
    These sincere words made us particularly excited and moved, because a close friendship had long been established between us and the workers of the Luoyang factory. As early as when the Luoyang Tractor Plant had just begun construction, a group of Chinese workers and engineers came to Kharkov. They underwent long-term internships in our workshops and various departments. The Chinese comrades mastered mechanical equipment and advanced production methods with great effort and a tenacious spirit of learning. We did our best to help them. Our great friendship was born in common labor. The Chinese comrades lived with us, spending their leisure time, celebrating festivals, and participating in our parades together.
    We completed the orders for the Luoyang factory with great labor enthusiasm. Everyone felt honored to be able to participate in this work. Because each of us sincerely hoped that the People's Republic of China could quickly become a powerful industrial country and realize agricultural technological transformation.
    I myself feel fortunate that I worked with Chinese comrades at the Luoyang factory for a year. In the summer of 1958, I went to China with some workers and experts. On the first day on Chinese soil, I felt as if I was in a country of sincere friends. It was already midnight when we arrived in Luoyang, but despite the late hour, the factory director, the Party Committee Secretary, and many workers and engineers who had previously interned in our country came to greet us. I find it difficult to describe this warm and sincere meeting in words. At the factory, I helped Chinese comrades master forging equipment technology. Whenever I stood next to the hammer and started working, people would surround me. Young people who came directly from the countryside to the factory often quickly mastered the technology. Before long, many of my students became excellent forgers.
    After returning to our country, like my comrades, I continued to receive letters and photos from my friends in Luoyang. We were most pleased that the China First Tractor Plant was already able to produce its own machines and that it had become a base for agricultural technological transformation.
    On the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, on behalf of our tens of millions of workers, I wish the Chinese tractor builders new great victories and happiness in their work and lives.
    May our friendship last forever!

### 愿我们的友谊万古长青

    愿我们的友谊万古长青
    苏联哈尔科夫拖拉机厂锻工车间工长　普罗哈连柯
    不久前，我们哈尔科夫拖拉机建设者收到来自人民中国的一件珍贵礼物。中国第一拖拉机厂的全体职工送给我们一面红旗。旗上写着极其动人的字句：
    “亲爱的同志们！我们建厂时，你们给了我们很大的帮助。值此工厂开工之际，谨送锦旗一面表示对你们的帮助的谢意。愿中苏两国友谊万古长青。”
    这些真诚的话使我们特别兴奋和激动，因为我们和洛阳工厂的职工之间早就建立了亲密的友谊联系。早在洛阳拖拉机厂刚刚开始建设时，就有一批中国工人和工程师来到了哈尔科夫。他们在我们的车间和各个部门进行了长期的实习。中国同志们以极大的努力和顽强的学习精神掌握了机械装备和先进的生产方法。我们竭尽全力帮助他们。我们伟大的友谊在共同的劳动中产生了。中国的同志们和我们住在一起，他们和我们一块度过休息时间、迎接节日和参加我们的游行。
    我们以巨大的劳动热情完成了洛阳工厂的定货。每一个人都为自己能够参加这项劳动而感到光荣。因为我们每一个人都衷心地希望人民中国能够很快地变成一个强大的工业国和实现农业技术改造。
    我自己感到幸福的是：我在洛阳工厂和中国同志们一起工作了一年。1958年夏天我同一些工人和专家一块到了中国。到中国土地的第一天，我就感到置身于真挚的朋友的国家里。我们到达洛阳时已经是半夜了，尽管深夜，工厂厂长、党委书记以及许多过去到过我国实习的工人和工程师都来迎接我们了。我很难用语言来描绘这次热情、诚挚的相会。在工厂里我帮助中国同志掌握锻压装备技术。每当我站在锤头旁边开始劳动时，人们就把我围起来。直接从农村来到工厂的青年们往往很快地掌握了技术。不久，我的学生中有很多都成为出色的锻工了。
    回国后，我和我的同志们一样，继续收到洛阳朋友的信和照片。我们感到最高兴的是中国第一拖拉机厂已经能生产本国的机器，它已经成为农业技术改造的基地。
    在苏中友好条约签订十周年的日子里，我代表我们千万名职工祝中国拖拉机建设者在劳动及生活中获得新的巨大胜利和幸福。
    祝我们的友谊万古长青！
