    Clearly Define the Main Attack Direction and Concentrate the Main Force
    Longshan Strengthens the Spring Ploughing Production Front Line
    (Our report) The Longshan County Party committees at all levels in Hunan Province have identified the current main attack direction and have resolutely and swiftly adopted strong measures to concentrate superior forces to strive for victory in the spring ploughing production battle. Since the beginning of February, the county has concentrated 81% of its labor force on the spring ploughing production front, and a production campaign centered on summer harvesting and spring ploughing is developing vigorously.
    Longshan County aims to achieve an all-round leap forward with grain as the key, guaranteeing an increase in grain production of 400 million catties this year. To achieve this great task, the area of spring-sown grain crops will be expanded from 50,000 mu last year to 440,000 mu, including 300,000 mu of newly reclaimed land this year, an average increase of 1.2 mu of cultivated land per person in the county. In order to achieve a double harvest of land and improve the multiple cropping index of dry land, dry land crops are also required to be sown before early rice transplanting this year. The County Party Committee analyzed this new situation and believed that time is currently pressing and the season is urging, and that only by adopting resolute and forceful means to prioritize the labor force required for spring ploughing production can we ensure the victory of spring ploughing production and achieve continued leap forward this year.
    The County Party Committee inspected the labor arrangements of various communes and found that individual communes had arranged their labor relatively dispersed. For example, in the Longguan Brigade of the Maoping Commune, only 351 of the 720 laborers were engaged in spring ploughing production, less than half of the total labor force. In the Suoduo Camp Production Team of this brigade, only six of the eighteen laborers were engaged in agriculture, and the only male laborer was the production team leader. The labor force engaged in industry, sideline occupations, and cash crops was both numerous and strong. At the same time, the brigade still had 100 people who had not been withdrawn from water conservancy projects. Based on the above situation, the County Party Committee promptly put forward the slogan of "resolutely implementing grain as the key and rapidly concentrating labor to strengthen the main attack line of agriculture," and at the same time organized various communes to conduct discussions in connection with good and bad typical examples from last year, clarified the relationship of interests, and prompted everyone to pay attention to the issue of rational arrangement of spring ploughing labor. All communes have checked the labor arrangements according to the spirit of the county party committee's instructions. After receiving instructions from the County Party Committee, the Liye Commune immediately increased the spring ploughing labor force from 55% of the total labor force to 85%.
    In order to strengthen the labor force on the front line of spring ploughing, the county has adopted many methods. First, while ensuring the safety of water conservancy projects, labor was transferred quickly. Through screening and assessment, 6,000 laborers were transferred from the water conservancy front to spring ploughing production. Secondly, the county completed the task of land reclamation across the board on February 10, and 60,000 land reclamation troops immediately rushed to the spring ploughing front. Third, in accordance with the principle of "reducing people and increasing production, small-scale activities during busy farming seasons, large-scale activities during slack farming seasons, and matching strong and weak labor," industry and sideline labor forces were transferred to support spring ploughing production. For projects that have raw materials, sales channels, and serve current agricultural production, measures such as tightening personnel, fixing tasks, and strengthening leadership are taken for arrangement. For example, the industrial and sideline labor force of the Zhaoshi Commune originally had 1,265 people. After reasonably arranging the labor force during the spring ploughing season, 320 people were actually retained. Due to the further development of tool reform and technological innovation, the production progress was actually faster than before. Taking the starch factory of this commune as an example, the average daily income increased from 500 yuan to 2,000 yuan after the reduction of personnel. Fourth, in terms of living welfare, on the premise of ensuring proper arrangements for life, strict quotas are implemented, and the "one specialty with multiple skills" and "everyone is a versatile person" campaign is carried out among service personnel, vigorously carrying out technological innovation, and drawing personnel to support spring ploughing production. The Caoyuan Brigade of the Xiche Commune originally had 197 service personnel, accounting for 13% of the total labor force, an average of one service person for every 33 people. Through tool reform, the number of people has now been reduced to 120, with an average of one service person for every 60 people. A total of 7,688 people were drawn from the county's 3,639 canteens to participate in spring ploughing production. Fifth, appropriate adjustments have also been made in animal husbandry production.
    After concentrating labor from the above aspects to strengthen the spring ploughing production front, a new atmosphere has emerged in the county's spring ploughing work. Originally, the daily progress of fertilizer accumulation in the county was only 800,000 dan, but now it has increased to 4.7 million dan. Some backward teams that had done poorly in preparing for spring ploughing have now quickly caught up. All 370,000 mu of summer harvest crops in the county have undergone two rounds of mid-tillage and topdressing, and one-third has already undergone three cultivations. The preparation work for sowing early rice, early corn, early sweet potatoes, and sugar beets is nearing completion. (Attached photo)

    明确主攻方向　集中主要力量
    龙山加强春耕生产第一线
    本报讯　湖南龙山县各级党委看准当前主攻方向，坚决、迅速采取有力措施，集中优势兵力，力争打好春耕生产一仗。从2月上旬起，全县已将81％的劳力集中到春耕生产战线上来，以夏收、春耕为中心的生产运动正波澜壮阔地向前发展。
    龙山县今年要实现以粮为纲的全面跃进，保证增产粮食四亿斤。为了实现这一伟大任务，春播粮食作物面积由去年的五万亩扩大到四十四万亩；其中今年新开荒地三十万亩，平均全县每人增加耕地面积一点二亩。为了使田土双丰收，并提高旱土复种指数，今年还要求旱土作物抢在早稻插秧以前播种完毕。县委分析了这一新情况，认为当前时间紧迫，季节催人，只有采取坚决有力的手段，优先保证春耕生产所需要的劳力，才能确保春耕生产的胜利，实现今年继续跃进。
    县委检查了各公社的劳力安排情况，发现个别公社将劳力安排得比较分散。如茅坪公社龙冠大队七百二十个劳力，搞春耕生产的只三百五十一人，不到总劳力的一半。这个大队的梭多营生产队十八个劳力，只有六人在搞农业，其中男劳力就是生产队长一个人；而在工业、副业、经济作物方面占的劳力却是人数既多又强；同时，这个大队在水利上还有一百人没有撤回来。县委根据以上情况，及时提出“坚决贯彻以粮为纲，迅速集中劳力加强农业主攻战线”的口号，同时组织各公社联系去年的好坏典型事例开展讨论，明确利害关系，促使大家重视合理安排春耕劳力问题。各公社都根据县委指示精神，检查了劳力安排情况。里耶公社在县委指示以后，立即将春耕劳力由原来占总劳力的55％增至85％。
    为了加强春耕第一线的劳力，全县采取了许多办法。首先在保证水利工程安全的前提下，迅速转移劳力。全县通过排队摸底，从水利战线转入春耕生产的劳力就有六千个。其次，全县于2月10日已全面完成开荒任务，六万名开荒大军立即奔赴春耕战线。第三，对工业、副业劳力本着“减人增产，农忙小搞，农闲大搞，强弱搭配”的原则，抽调劳力支援春耕生产。凡有原料、有销路，又为当前农业生产服务的项目，采取紧缩人员、固定任务、加强领导的办法，进行安排。如召市公社工业、副业劳力原有一千二百六十五人，春耕期间合理安排劳力后，实际留了三百二十人，由于工具改革、技术革新运动进一步开展，生产进度反而比以前加快。以这个公社的淀粉厂为例，减人以后平均每天收入由原来的五百元上升到二千元。第四，生活福利方面，在保证安排好生活的条件下，严格实行定员定额，并在服务性人员中开展“一专多能”、“人人都是多面手”运动，大力开展技术革新，抽出人员支援春耕生产。洗车公社草原大队原有一百九十七个服务人员，占总劳力的13％，平均每三十三人中有一个服务人员。通过工具改革，现在人数减少到一百二十人，平均每六十人中才有一个服务人员。全县三千六百三十九个食堂共抽出了七千六百八十八人投入春耕生产。第五、在畜牧生产方面，也适当地作了调整。
    从以上几个方面集中劳力加强春耕生产战线后，全县春耕工作出现了崭新气象。原来全县积肥日进度只八十万担，现在增加到四百七十万担。原来有一部分后进队春耕准备工作做得差，现在迅速赶了上来。全县三十七万亩夏收作物全部中耕追肥二道，有三分之一已经过三次培育。早稻、早包谷、早红薯及甜菜的播种准备工作，已接近完成。（附图片）
