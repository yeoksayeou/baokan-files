Xinhua News Agency, February 26th. The All-China Women's Federation sent a telegram to the Federation of Cuban Women, expressing immense anger at the continuous bombing of Cuba by American planes. The telegram stated: "Upon hearing the news of the continuous bombing of Cuba by American planes, Chinese women express immense anger at the crimes of US imperialism in threatening the lives and safety of the Cuban people, women, and children, and in destroying the Cuban national economy."

The telegram pointed out: "Recently, US imperialism has blatantly intensified its military threats against Cuba and is plotting an armed invasion. Eisenhower's visit to Latin American countries is an attempt to deceive and intimidate the Latin American people, isolate Cuba, and destroy the Cuban revolution. The wolfish ambitions of US imperialism are fully exposed."

The telegram stated: "Chinese women have always been concerned about and supported our Cuban sisters in their just struggle to resolutely oppose the aggression of US imperialism, defend the fruits of the Cuban revolution, and protect their homeland. We firmly believe that as long as the heroic Cuban people and women unite closely, heighten their vigilance, and with the support of all the Latin American people and righteous people around the world, they will surely be able to shatter all the conspiracies and schemes of US imperialism. Victory will surely belong to you."

    电报说：“中国妇女一向关怀和支持古巴姐妹们坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略，保卫古巴革命胜利果实，保卫家园的正义斗争。我们坚信，只要英勇的古巴人民和妇女紧密团结起来，提高警惕，在全体拉丁美洲人民和全世界正义人们的支持下，一定能够粉碎美帝国主义的一切阴谋诡计。胜利一定属于你们。”
