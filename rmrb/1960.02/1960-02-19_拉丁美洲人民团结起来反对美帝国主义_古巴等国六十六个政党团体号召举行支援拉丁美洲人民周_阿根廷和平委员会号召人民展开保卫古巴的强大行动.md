Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 17th: Sixty-six parties and people's organizations from Cuba and other Latin American countries issued a joint statement today, calling on mass organizations and people from all walks of life in Cuba and throughout Latin America to hold a Week of Solidarity with Latin American Peoples from March 20th to 26th. The statement pointed out: The forces of U.S. imperialism are what keep our countries backward and impoverished, and oppose independent development and progress. Since the beginning of this century, the capital of American capitalists has invaded Latin America, turning these countries into semi-colonies enslaved by American trusts and monopolies. They use the big landowners and reactionary military cliques within these countries to control Latin American governments, forcibly establish and support dictatorial regimes, in order to plunder the natural resources of our countries and extract huge profits, while our people live and die in terrible poverty.

The statement emphasized that the just and patriotic struggle to win respect for national sovereignty, to win democracy, and to win independent economic development requires us to strengthen ties so that we can unite, strengthen and develop the mutual support so necessary to achieve our common goals. The statement called on the Latin American people to hold various rallies and protests during the Week of Solidarity to express support for the Cuban revolution, which has been attacked by U.S. imperialism and dictatorial governments and faces the threat of armed intervention; to support the struggle of the Venezuelan people, who are constantly threatened by military rebels serving foreign monopolies; to support the heroic struggle of patriots in Dominica, Nicaragua, Paraguay and Haiti to liberate their people from cruel and bloody dictatorships; to support the independence demands of Puerto Rico, which is still a U.S. colony, and the demands for the release of Albizu Campos and others who have been arrested for longing for their country's freedom and independence; to support the demands for respect for the democratic freedoms of the Argentine people and the trade union rights of workers; to support the struggle of the Panamanian people, whose voices for national sovereignty over the Canal Zone have shown combativeness and heroism; and to support the struggle of the Guatemalan people, whose democratic system was overthrown by imperialist forces in collusion with Guatemalan traitors.

The statement was signed by: the Cuban Workers' Confederation, the "26th of July Movement," the People's Socialist Party, the Revolutionary Directorate, the Cuban Federation of University Students, the Cuban Movement for the Defense of Peace and Sovereignty, the Catholic Men's Youth Action Federation, the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, the Nicaraguan Socialist Party, the Nicaraguan Republican Movement Party, the Dominican Liberation Movement, and other cultural figures, freelancers, religious and women's organizations.

Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, 17th: The Argentine Peace Committee issued a statement on the Cuban situation, saying that the Latin American people are disturbed by the anti-Cuban slander campaign launched by the United States. The statement said, "This unease is well-founded, because the indelible memory of Guatemala shows that this verbal and written attack dangerously foreshadows the prelude to actual aggression."

The statement said that the Peace Committee "once again calls on the people to launch powerful actions of solidarity with and defense of Cuba, to defend peace and sovereignty under threat. We should make it impossible for aggression to be launched." The statement said that when Eisenhower visits Argentina, the Argentine people should tell him that Latin America demands unconditional respect for the right of all peoples to self-determination. If an aggression against Cuba occurs, the Argentine people are prepared to support Cuba.

    拉丁美洲人民团结起来反对美帝国主义
    古巴等国六十六个政党团体号召举行支援拉丁美洲人民周
    阿根廷和平委员会号召人民展开保卫古巴的强大行动
    新华社哈瓦那17日电　古巴和拉丁美洲其他国家的六十六个党派和人民团体今天发表联合声明，号召古巴和全拉丁美洲的群众组织和各阶层人民在3月20日到26日举行支援拉丁美洲人民周。声明指出：在我们各国人民中保持落后和贫困、反对独立发展和进步的是美帝国主义势力。从本世纪初起，美国资本家的资本侵入了拉丁美洲，把我们这些国家变成受美国托辣斯和垄断集团奴役的半殖民地。他们利用我们这些国家内部的大庄园主和反动军事集团来控制拉丁美洲的政府，强迫建立并支持独裁政权，以便掠夺我们各国人民的自然资源和榨取巨额利润，而我们各国人民却在可怕的贫困中生活和死亡。
    声明强调指出，争取尊重民族主权、争取民主、争取经济的独立发展的正义的和爱国的斗争要求我们加强联系，以便使我们团结起来，加强和发展为达到我们共同目的而非常需要的相互支援。声明号召拉丁美洲人民在支援周中举行各种集会，提出抗议，以表示支持遭到美帝国主义和独裁政府攻击和面临武装干涉威胁的古巴革命；支持经常遭受为外国垄断集团效劳的军事叛乱分子威胁的委内瑞拉人民的斗争；支持多米尼加、尼加拉瓜、巴拉圭和海地的爱国者争取把他们的人民从残酷和血腥的独裁统治下解放出来的英勇斗争；支持现在还是美国殖民地的波多黎各的独立要求和关于释放阿耳维苏·坎波斯及其他由于渴望自己国家取得自由和独立而被捕的人的要求；支持尊重阿根廷人民的民主自由和工人的工会权利的要求；支持巴拿马人民的斗争，巴拿马人民争取行使运河区民族主权的呼声已经表现出战斗性和英雄主义的气概；支持危地马拉人民的斗争，危地马拉人民的民主制度曾被帝国主义势力勾结危地马拉的叛徒所推翻。
    在这项声明上签字的有：古巴工人联合会、“7月26日运动”、人民社会党、革命指导委员会、古巴大学生联合会、古巴保卫和平和主权运动、天主教男青年行动联合会、波多黎各国民党、尼加拉瓜社会主义党、尼加拉瓜共和运动党、多米尼加解放运动及其他一些文化界人士、自由职业者、宗教和妇女组织。
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯17日电　阿根廷和平委员会就古巴局势发表声明说，拉丁美洲人民对美国发动的反古巴的诽谤运动感到不安。声明说，“这种不安是很有道理的，因为，关于危地马拉的不可磨灭的记忆使人看到，这种口头的和文字的攻击，危险地预示着实际侵略的序幕。”
    声明说，和平委员会“再一次号召人民展开声援和保卫古巴的强大行动，以保卫受到威胁的和平和主权。我们应该使侵略发动不了”。声明说，当艾森豪威尔访问阿根廷的时候，阿根廷人民应该告诉他，拉丁美洲要求无条件地尊重各国人民的自决权。一旦发生了对古巴的侵略，阿根廷人民准备支援古巴。
