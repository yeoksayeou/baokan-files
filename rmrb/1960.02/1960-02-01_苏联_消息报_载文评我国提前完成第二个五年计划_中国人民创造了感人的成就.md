Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 31st: The Soviet "Izvestia" published an article on the 30th by its Beijing correspondent, Robeda, entitled "The Moving Fruits of Labor," hailing China's early completion of the Second Five-Year Plan.

The article said that the news of China's early completion of the Second Five-Year Plan convincingly shows that China has taken a new and important step forward on the road to becoming a powerful industrial country. It also shows that the liberated Chinese people have inexhaustible strength, and the socialist system inspires their great creative talents.

The article said that China's total industrial and agricultural output value in 1959 increased by 31.1% compared with 1958. This is a great victory for hundreds of millions of Chinese working people who, responding to the call of the Communist Party, have created outstanding achievements for the motherland with their heroic labor.

After listing the growth figures of China's important industrial and agricultural products last year, the author said that not long ago, China was still a backward, semi-colonial country. Today, it has joined the ranks of the world's major producers of coal, copper, and pig iron.

The article said that behind the published figures lies the great labor made by the people and the great work of the Chinese Communist Party, the ideological inspirer and organizer of the masses. The Chinese working class, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals have a conscious sense of responsibility for the new society they have created.

When talking about the achievements of China's agricultural production last year, the article cited the number of people who suffered from famine due to floods and droughts in old China. The article continued, last year, some areas of China suffered from various serious floods and droughts. However, agricultural production not only did not decline, but increased by 16.7% compared with the previous year. The Chinese people deeply trust the people's government because it has eliminated the hunger that has threatened the country for centuries and greatly improved the people's living standards.

The article said that the achievements of People's China are an outstanding example for the people of Asia and Africa, who can see through what ways and under what system the creative power of the working masses can be brought into play.

The article finally emphasized that the achievements of the People's Republic of China have strengthened the strength and power of the entire socialist world. The close cooperation and mutual assistance of socialist countries are an extremely important source of their rapid development.

    苏联“消息报”载文评我国提前完成第二个五年计划
    中国人民创造了感人的成就
    新华社莫斯科31日电　苏联“消息报”30日刊登了这家报纸驻北京记者罗伯达的一篇题为“感人的劳动的果实”的文章，欢呼中国提前完成第二个五年计划。
    文章说，中国提前完成第二个五年计划的消息令人信服地表明中国在变成强大的工业国的道路上向前迈出了新的重要的一步。这还说明，解放了的中国人民有着永不枯竭的力量，社会主义制度激发起他们的巨大的创造才能。
    文章说，中国1959年的工农业总产值比1958年增加了31．1％，这是几亿中国劳动人民的巨大胜利，他们响应共产党的号召，用自己英勇的劳动为祖国创造了卓越的成绩。
    作者在列举去年中国工农业重要产品增长数字之后说，不久以前，中国还是一个落后的、半殖民地的国家，今天，它已侪身于生产煤、铜、生铁最多的世界大国之列。
    文章说，在所发表的数字后面，有着人民所作出的巨大劳动，有着群众思想鼓舞者和组织者——中国共产党的巨大工作。中国工人阶级、农民和革命知识分子对他们所创造的新社会有着自觉的责任感。
    文章在谈到去年中国农业生产成就的时候，援引了旧中国水旱灾而遭受饥荒的人数。文章接着说，去年中国的一些地区遭受了各种严重水旱灾害，然而，农业生产不但没有下降，反而比上一年增加了16．7％。中国人民深深信任人民政权，因为它消除了多少世纪来威胁着国家的饥饿，大大提高了人民的生活水平。
    文章说，人民中国的成就是亚非各国人民的卓越的榜样，他们可以看到，劳动群众的创造力量通过什么样的途径，在什么样的制度下才能发挥出来。
    文章最后强调说，中华人民共和国的成就增强了整个社会主义世界的力量和威力。社会主义国家的紧密合作和互助，是它们迅速发展的极重要泉源。
