    Wanrong Flowers Bloom Throughout the Region
    Zhao Yuting, First Secretary of the CPC Jinan Prefectural Committee, Shanxi Province
    Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, the industrial and agricultural production in the Jinan region has experienced tremendous development. With the development of production, the broad masses of workers and peasants have an increasingly urgent need to improve their scientific and cultural level. In the past few years, we have actively led the masses in eliminating illiteracy and learning culture, and have achieved great results, but it still cannot fully meet the needs of the high-speed development of production and the urgent requirements of the broad masses for learning science and culture.
    Wanrong County has adopted the phonetic alphabet method of literacy, providing a good experience in timely consolidating and expanding the results of literacy and improving the scientific and cultural level of the masses at a high speed, and has achieved remarkable results. In the past year, 90% of the county's young and middle-aged people have escaped illiteracy and eradicated the phenomenon of re-illiteracy. Due to the adoption of this method, the scientific and cultural level of the broad masses has been improved, and reading newspapers, learning technology, and writing compositions and poems have become a common practice. At the same time, due to the correct pronunciation function of phonetic alphabet, the broad masses have also learned Mandarin Chinese.
    The experience of Wanrong County proves that phonetic alphabet literacy is a shortcut to the intellectualization of workers and peasants and an effective method for learning culture quickly and well. In order to meet the requirements of the broad masses for learning science and culture and the needs of high-speed development of production, we have decided to actively, rapidly, and universally promote the experience of Wanrong throughout the Jinan region.
    After Shanxi Province held an on-site meeting in Wanrong to promote phonetic alphabet literacy and the promotion of Mandarin Chinese, in a short month, a upsurge in learning phonetic alphabet and Mandarin Chinese has formed among the broad masses of workers, peasants, cadres, and students in rural areas, factories, mines, government offices, and schools throughout the Jinan region, but the development is still uneven. We must continue to strengthen leadership and put forward different requirements according to different situations: all areas that are currently eliminating illiteracy should adopt the phonetic alphabet method of literacy; industrial and agricultural spare-time schools and all primary schools in areas that have already eliminated illiteracy should learn phonetic alphabet and read phonetic alphabet reading materials; all schools should learn phonetic alphabet and use Mandarin Chinese for teaching; cadres of government offices should also actively learn phonetic alphabet and Mandarin Chinese.
    We must let the flower of Wanrong bloom throughout the region, so that the broad masses and cadres can universally master this method of learning culture quickly, well, and economically, rapidly improve the scientific and cultural level, and better promote the great development of industrial and agricultural production.

    全区怒放万荣花
    中共山西省晋南地委第一书记　赵雨亭
    在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，晋南区的工农业生产有了巨大发展。随着生产的发展，广大工农群众对于提高科学文化的要求越来越迫切。几年来，我们积极领导群众扫除文盲、学习文化，取得了很大成绩，但是还不能完全适应生产高速度发展的需要和满足广大群众学习科学文化的迫切要求。
    万荣县采用注音扫盲的办法，在及时巩固和扩大扫盲成果，高速度提高群众科学文化水平方面提供了良好的经验，获得了显著的成效。一年来，全县90％的青壮年摆脱了文盲状态，而且根绝了复盲现象。由于采用了这一办法，广大群众的科学文化水平提高了，阅读书报，学习技术，作文写诗，已成风气。同时由于拼音字母的正音作用，广大群众还学会了普通话。
    万荣县的经验证明：注音扫盲是工农群众知识化的捷径，是又快又好学习文化的有效方法。为了满足广大群众学习科学文化的要求和高速度发展生产的需要，我们决定在晋南全区范围内积极地迅速地普遍推广万荣的经验。
    山西省开过推行注音扫盲和推广普通话万荣现场会议后，在短短一个月的时间内，晋南全区农村、厂矿、机关、学校的广大工农群众和干部、学生学习拼音字母和普通话的热潮已经形成，但是发展还不平衡。我们必须继续加强领导，针对不同情况提出不同要求：正在扫除文盲的地区，都要采用注音扫盲的办法；已经扫除了文盲的地区的工农业余学校和所有小学，都要学习拼音字母和阅读注音读物；一切学校都要学拼音字母，并用普通话进行教学；机关干部也都要积极学习拼音字母和普通话。
    我们一定要让万荣之花，怒放全区，使广大群众和干部普遍掌握这个多快好省地学习文化的方法，迅速提高科学文化水平，更好地促进工农业生产的大发展。
