Directing Water Control in Plain Areas: Toward a Network of Rivers
By Our Staff Commentator

Since ancient times, people in many regions of northern China have yearned for the prosperity and beauty of the Jiangnan region (south of the Yangtze River). However, before liberation, people couldn't even dream of "turning the North into Jiangnan." In the past two years, under the leadership of the Party, in the Great Leap Forward, relying on the strength of the people's communes and the wisdom of the masses, a brilliant plan to turn the North into Jiangnan has been found: realizing a network of rivers in plain areas.

The idea of realizing a network of rivers in the plains was proposed by the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, summarizing seven years of experience in harnessing the Huai River, based on the characteristics of the Huaibei Plain. It fully complies with the central government's guiding principle of "emphasizing water storage, focusing on small-scale projects, and relying mainly on self-reliance by the masses" in water control, and is the best application of this principle in plain areas. The people of Huaibei, with the ambition of "turning Huaibei into Jiangnan in two or three years," have already created hundreds of "small Jiangnans," transforming millennia of water disasters into water conservancy, bringing about tremendous changes in both production and the natural landscape. Many places in Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, and other provinces have also used the experience of river networks in water control and have achieved good results.

The success of river networks in many areas is a victory in the struggle between the water control principle of emphasizing water storage and the water control principle of emphasizing drainage. The main content of the river network movement is to universally mobilize the strength of the masses to dig rivers and store water in vast areas. Practice has proven that this is the correct path to eliminate waterlogging and drought disasters in plain areas. By storing water in certain places during periods of excessive rainfall and then diverting it to irrigate the land during periods of water shortage, it is possible to control both floods and droughts. However, in the past, the passive water control ideology of emphasizing drainage has always dominated. People believed that as long as dikes were repaired and rivers dredged to send away floods, the task of water control was completed. In reality, adopting this method not only failed to utilize water for benefit, but also failed to effectively eliminate harm. Because in the vast plains, the amount of incoming water is always greater than the drainage capacity of the existing rivers, it is impossible to smoothly send away floods during periods of concentrated rainfall by relying solely on a few rivers; even if flood disasters are avoided at certain points and lines, waterlogging disasters over large areas still exist; and when there is a lack of rain, droughts will still occur. Since the winter of 1957, the Party's water control policy of emphasizing water storage has been universally implemented in vast areas; in the Huaibei area, large-scale river network projects have been undertaken according to this policy. In areas where river networks have been realized, the past situation of either waterlogging or drought has fundamentally changed, and drought, waterlogging, and flood disasters have been eliminated in one fell swoop.

River networks have even more significant implications: they can transform all cultivated land in plain areas into irrigated land and paddy fields, rapidly turning low-yield areas into high-yield areas. The grain yield of dry land north of the Huai River in China is two-thirds to one-half lower than that of the rice-producing areas in Jiangnan. If several hundred million mu of rice were planted in the areas north of the Huai River and the Qinling Mountains, the production landscape of these areas could be rapidly changed, and tens of billions of catties of grain could be increased. Why has the progress of converting to rice cultivation in the northern plain areas been slow in the past? The main reason is that the water problem has not been solved. Building river networks and storing large amounts of water can solve this problem. River networks can store rainwater from the sky, runoff from the ground, and water from underground, so that even in times of drought, there is water for transplanting rice seedlings; during the rainy season, even with continuous rainfall of three to four hundred millimeters, waterlogging disasters will not occur. In the northern plains of China, there are many low-lying areas that used to be able to grow only one crop of wheat each year, and once the flood season arrived after the wheat harvest, they became large reservoirs. After river networks are built in these areas, it may be possible to implement double cropping of rice and wheat (this has already been implemented in Huaibei). In areas where river networks have been realized, with an abundance of water for irrigation, dry land will also be transformed into irrigated land. All of these can greatly increase yields. From this perspective, river networks are indeed a low-cost, high-yield measure to increase production, closely combining the elimination of water hazards, the development of water conservancy, and the reform of cropping systems.

River networks can not only greatly improve agricultural production in plain areas, but also promote the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. Interconnected rivers and canals can be used to raise large numbers of fish, ducks, and geese, and to cultivate large quantities of aquatic plants; many aquatic plants are good pig feed, which is also conducive to the development of pig farming. Large numbers of trees can be planted on the embankments of river networks, forming crisscrossing economic forest belts, timber forest belts, and fruit tree belts, realizing greening, beautification, and the transformation of the land into a garden; this can also improve the continental climate and prevent wind and frost damage.

River networks are also greatly conducive to the realization of agricultural modernization. They are not only directly conducive to water conservancy but also very conducive to mechanization and electrification. After river networks are built, the land is leveled into neat, large blocks, which are more convenient for irrigation and cultivation. Boats can travel in the rivers, and cars can pass on the dikes, greatly developing water and land transportation. Small hydropower stations can also be built using the water head difference.

In short, river networks are a good way to comprehensively utilize water and land resources in plain areas. The masses in Huaibei praise this comprehensive utilization, saying: "River networks are greatly beneficial, drought is not a worry, waterlogging is not a fear, navigation and power generation, raising fish and ducks, duckweed feeding pigs, greening on both banks, sand and gravel paving the roads, developed transportation, rice and fish, eternal glory." These changes were unimaginable to the local people before the river networks were built.

To realize river networks, it is necessary to mobilize the strength of the broad masses and to uniformly utilize land and water resources in accordance with the overall interests. Therefore, this was fundamentally impossible under the conditions of the past small-scale peasant economy; even smaller agricultural cooperatives found it difficult to do such big things. With the people's communes, such good things can be done on a large scale and in a special way. In the vast plain areas of the North, the advantageous conditions of the people's communes should be well utilized to realize river networks faster and better. To this end, it is first necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership and strengthen ideological work. River networks are a new thing in China's water control work. Like other new things, it will inevitably encounter obstacles from various old ideas in its development. Changing the traditional passive water control ideology of emphasizing drainage and establishing an active water control ideology of emphasizing water storage is still a very important issue. The former water control ideology was produced under the conditions of very low productivity levels and under the control of feudal and small-scale peasant economic production relations. People could not use the collective strength to control nature in a planned way, and could not make overall considerations for drainage, water use, and land utilization, so they could only regard eliminating floods as the highest goal of water control. The latter water control ideology was produced in the socialist era and is a reflection of the great advancement in the mode of production. People can uniformly utilize human, material, and land resources, and have recognized the internal connections of things, so they can further tame floods, so that they not only do not harm but also benefit people. The struggle between the two water control principles is a struggle between advanced and backward ideas, and in a certain sense, it also reflects the struggle between two roads. All those who believe in the strength of the Party and the masses and demand to build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way will certainly agree with the latter water control principle and disagree with the former water control principle. Adopting the water control principle of river network water storage will, of course, require more labor and effort; and accelerating the realization of river networks will naturally make the work more intense. However, these are completely worthwhile. Whichever area realizes river networks sooner can improve productivity faster, make greater contributions to the people of the whole country, and better improve the lives of the local people. As long as there is the ambition to accelerate the conquest of nature and the advantageous conditions of the people's communes can be fully utilized to launch a mass movement, problems such as insufficient labor will certainly not be unsolvable. Fuyang and Suixi counties in Huaibei have basically realized river networks after more than two years of hard work and ingenuity. The earthwork and stonework of the river network projects done in Huaibei in two years exceeded the earthwork and stonework of the water conservancy projects done in the previous eight years by several times, and the area of rice cultivation increased sharply from less than one million mu in 1957 to more than five million mu. These are the results of the serious and concrete leadership of the Party committees at all levels and the development of a mass movement for river networks.

River networks are a comprehensive measure to comprehensively transform the natural landscape of plain areas. It is not just a water control project, not a temporary expedient, nor is it something that can be carried out in isolation in local areas. Therefore, it is necessary for all parts of the plain area to make serious and comprehensive plans. Each province, special zone, county, and people's commune needs to consider this issue carefully, in close cooperation with each other, and in light of local conditions. Not only should the local area be considered, but also the surrounding areas; not only should the present be considered, but also the future. The initial plan cannot be made very carefully, but as long as one is good at learning from the experience of advanced areas, good at consulting with the masses, and conducts serious investigations and research on local characteristics, one can gradually improve the plan and achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Through planning, one can grasp the overall situation of the local area, distinguish the order of priorities, and help solve problems in drought-prone and waterlogging-prone areas as soon as possible. With a plan, the vast number of cadres and the masses will have clear goals, and they will be able to give full play to their initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity in building river networks.

    平原地区治水的方向——河网化
    本报评论员
    自古以来，我国北方许多地区的人们都向往江南的富饶美丽。但是，在解放以前，人们想也不敢想“要把北方变成江南”。近两年，在党的领导下，在大跃进中，依靠人民公社的力量，依靠群众的智慧，已经找到了把北方变成江南的妙计，这就是在平原地区实现河网化。
    平原要实现河网化，是中共安徽省委总结了七年治淮经验，根据淮北平原的特点提出的倡议。它完全符合中央指示的“蓄水为主、小型为主、群众自办为主”的治水方针，是这个方针在平原地区最好的运用。淮北地区人民抱了“要在两三年内把淮北变成江南”的雄心，已经创造了成百个“小江南”，使千年水害变为水利，生产面貌和自然面貌发生了巨大的变化。河北、山东、江苏、河南等省的许多地方，运用了河网化的治水经验，也都收到了很好的效果。
    河网化在许多地区的胜利，是以蓄水为主的治水方针同以泄水为主的治水方针斗争的胜利。河网化运动的主要内容，就是普遍发动群众的力量，在广大地区挖河蓄水。实践证明，这是消除平原地区水旱灾害的正确道路。在雨水过多时期把水积蓄在一定的地方，到雨水缺少的时期再引出来浇地，既可以制服洪涝灾害，又可以抗旱。可是，在过去，以泄为主的消极的治水思想一直占优势。人们认为：只要修好堤防，疏浚河道，送走洪水，就算完成了治水任务。实际上，采取这种办法，不但不能运用水来兴利，而且也不能很好地除弊。因为在广大的平原上，来水量总是大于原有河道的排水量，雨水集中时期光靠少数河道不可能顺利地送走洪水；即使在某些点和线上免除了洪灾，而广大面积上的涝灾却仍然存在；到了缺雨的时候，也仍然会发生旱灾。从1957年冬季开始，党确定的以蓄水为主的治水方针在广大地区普遍贯彻执行；在淮北地区，根据这个方针大兴河网工程。实现了河网化的地区，过去那种非涝即旱的情况根本改观，旱涝洪灾一举消除。
    河网化还有更为重大的意义：它能够使平原地区的耕地都变成水浇地和稻田，把低产区迅速变为高产区。我国淮河以北的旱地，粮食产量要比江南的水稻产区低二分之一以至三分之二。淮河和秦岭以北的地区，如果改种几亿亩水稻，就可以把这些地区的生产面貌迅速改变，就可以增产成千亿斤粮食。为什么过去北方平原地区改种水稻的进度不快呢？主要原因，还是水的问题没有解决。兴修河网，大量蓄水，就可以解决这个问题。河网能把天上雨水、地面径流和地下的水都蓄起来，即使天旱，也有水插秧；在雨季，即使连降三、四百毫米的大雨，也不会发生涝灾。我国北方平原，有不少低洼地区过去每年只能种一季小麦，收麦后汛期一到，便成了大蓄水池。这些地区兴修了河网，就可能改为稻麦连作（淮北已经实行）。实现了河网化的地区，有了充裕的水可以灌溉，旱地也都将变成水浇地。这些，都能够大大提高产量。这样看来，河网化的确是一种花钱少、收效快的增产措施，它把除水害、兴水利和改革耕作制度密切结合起来了。
    河网化不但能使平原地区的农业生产大为改观，而且有利于农林牧副渔全面发展。河渠纵横相连，能够大量养鱼、养鸭、养鹅，大量培植水生植物；有许多水生植物是很好的养猪饲料，这就又有利于发展养猪事业。河网堤上可以大量栽树，形成纵横交错的一条条经济林带、用材林带和果木林带，实现绿化、美化、大地园林化；这样还能改善大陆气候，防止风灾冻害。
    河网化还大大有利于农业现代化的实现。不但直接有利于水利化，而且十分有利于机械化、电气化。河网化后土地平整为整齐的大片的方块，更便于灌溉，也更便于机耕。河里能够行船，堤上能够通汽车，水陆交通就会大大发展。利用水的落差还可以建设小型水电站。
    总之，河网化是平原地区水利资源和土地资源综合利用的好办法。淮北群众歌颂这种综合利用说：“河网化，好处大，旱不愁，涝不怕，航运发电，养鱼养鸭，浮莲喂猪，两岸绿化，砂礓铺路，交通发达，有米有鱼，万年荣华。”这种变化，是当地的人们在河网化以前难以想像的。
    要实现河网化，必须动员广大群众的力量，必须按照总体的利益统一利用土地和水源。因此，在过去的小农经济的条件下，这是根本办不到的事情；规模较小的农业社，也很难办这样的大事。有了人民公社，这样的好事就可以大办而特办了。在北方广大平原地区，应该好好运用人民公社的有利条件，更快地更好地实现河网化。为此，首先要加强党的领导，加强思想工作。河网化是我国治水工作中的新事物。它和其他新事物一样，在发展中必然会碰到各式各样的旧思想的障碍。改变传统的以泄水为主的消极的治水思想，树立以蓄水为主的积极的治水思想，仍然是一个很重要的问题。前一种治水思想，是在生产力水平很低的情况下，在封建的和小农经济的生产关系的支配下产生的。人们不能运用集体的力量有计划地控制自然，不能对排水、用水和土地利用作通盘的考虑，就只能把排除洪水作为治水的最高的奋斗目标。后一种治水思想，是社会主义时代产生的，是生产方式大大前进的反映。人们能够统一地运用人力物力地力，认识了事物的内在联系，就能够进一步驯服洪水，使它不但不能为害而且为人们造福。两种治水方针的斗争，是先进思想与落后思想的斗争，在一定意义上也反映了两条道路的斗争。凡是相信党和群众的力量，要求多快好省地建设社会主义的人们，就一定会赞成后一种治水方针，而不赞成前一种治水方针。采取河网蓄水的治水方针，当然要花费比较多的劳动力和心思；要加速实现河网化，工作也自然会比较紧张。可是，这些是完全值得的。哪个地区早日实现河网化，哪个地方就能更快地提高生产力，就能对全国人民有更多的贡献，就能更好地改善当地人民的生活。只要有加速征服大自然的雄心壮志，又能充分运用人民公社的有利条件，大搞群众运动，劳力不足等等问题决不是不能解决的。淮北阜阳、濉溪两县经过两年多的苦战巧干，就已经基本实现河网化。淮北两年内所做河网化工程的土石方，超过前八年所做水利工程的土石方好几倍，改种水稻面积由1957年不到百万亩猛增到五百多万亩。这都是各级党委认真进行了具体领导，开展了河网化的群众运动的结果。
    河网化是全面改造平原地区自然面貌的综合措施，不只是一个治水工程，并不是一项临时的权宜办法，也不是局部地区可以孤立进行的事情。因此，需要平原地区各地认真地通盘地作出全面规划。各个省、专区、县和人民公社，需要根据当地的条件，密切配合，互相协作，周密考虑这个问题。不仅要考虑本地，还要考虑到周围；不仅要考虑当前，还要考虑到将来。规划最初不可能做得很周到，但是，只要善于学习先进地区的经验，善于和群众商量，对本地特点进行认真的调查研究，就能逐步使规划完善起来，做到多快好省。通过规划，就能掌握当地全面情况，分清先后缓急，尽快帮助易旱易涝的地方解决问题。有了规划，就使广大干部和群众有明确的奋斗目标，就能充分发挥他们兴修河网的主动性、积极性和创造性。
