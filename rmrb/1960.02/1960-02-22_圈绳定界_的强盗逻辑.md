    The Thuggish Logic of "Drawing Boundaries with a Rope"
    Recently, the scope of the "Far East" has become the focus of a fierce debate in the Japanese Diet. The Japanese Diet is neither a geographical research institute nor an editorial office of an encyclopedia, so why is it engaging in this kind of textual research? This storm originated from the US-Japan military alliance treaty.
    The US-Japanese reactionaries, with a guilty conscience, went to great lengths when concluding the military alliance treaty, which openly antagonizes China, the Soviet Union, and the people of Asia, using a lot of words like "defense" and "peace" to decorate this aggressive military treaty. However, the new treaty contains the phrase "for the peace and security of the Far East," which completely exposes the deceptive lies of the US-Japanese reactionaries regarding US-Japan "mutual defense." Since the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" includes the Far East as its area of implementation, it clearly reveals that this treaty is aimed at waging aggressive wars in Asia.
    If the inclusion of the words "Far East" in the new "Security Treaty" already revealed the aggressors' true colors, then the replies of figures like Nobusuke Kishi in the Diet further exposed their true nature. First, Japanese Foreign Minister Fujiyama, clearly a little carried away, explained that the scope of the "Far East" mentioned in the "US-Japan Security" treaty includes "the area north of the Philippines, the Chinese coast, and the Soviet Maritime Territory." This explanation inadvertently confessed where the aggressive spearhead of the US-Japan military alliance was pointing, and immediately aroused fierce condemnation from righteous public opinion both in Japan and abroad. Later, in the Japanese Diet, under the questioning of the opposition party, Nobusuke Kishi equivocated, saying that the "Far East" did not include the Soviet Union and China, but did include the Soviet Kuril Islands and the Chinese Jinmen and Matsu. This incoherent sophistry by Nobusuke Kishi actually made the aggressive ambitions of the US-Japanese reactionaries even more apparent. Even Japanese bourgeois newspapers believed that Nobusuke Kishi was talking nonsense. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" wrote in a satirical tone: "According to the Japanese government's interpretation, North Korea is certainly not considered the Far East, and China, which demonstrates 'the East wind prevailing over the West wind,' is even less so. It can be seen that political Japanese is indeed an elusive thing!"
    In the end, the lackey is not as cunning as the master. Nobusuke Kishi's repeated explanations of "Far East" did not meet Washington's intentions. According to US news agencies, the US State Department, "which had been silent on the debate in Japan," finally spoke up. It stated that it "was unwilling to give any strict definition to the term Far East." A key member of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee further stated that "it is better not to define this term" and that "it is better to use vague terms as in the treaty."
    Obviously, from the perspective of the US ruling group, a "vague" definition of the "Far East" would allow for greater flexibility. Wherever I say it is, it is; wherever I want to go, I will go, doing as I please, so why should I limit myself in advance? The United States has long had its own "unconventional" interpretation of such geographical terms. For example, according to the Washington-specific dictionary, "Southeast Asia" includes the United States, Britain, and France, so they should participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization; the North Atlantic can extend to the coasts of Turkey and Italy, so they can become members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This is the thuggish logic of the US imperialism in "drawing boundaries with a rope." The Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun" put it well: "From the 'Far East' mentioned in the new US-Japan Security Treaty, this is the American method of 'drawing boundaries with a rope.' 'Drawing boundaries with a rope' is not determined by law, but by strength. Therefore, in the eyes of the United States, it is extremely foolish to rigidly define this line from where to where." However, this approach by the United States is not necessarily smart, because it actually reminds the people of all countries that it is not only the people of Japan, the Soviet Union, and China who should stand up and resolutely oppose the US-Japan military alliance.

### “圈绳定界”的强盗逻辑

    “圈绳定界”的强盗逻辑
    最近，关于“远东”的范围问题成了日本国会内一场激烈舌战的焦点。日本国会既不是什么地理研究所，也不是什么大百科辞典编辑部，为什么要做起这种训诂工作来呢？这场风波原来是美日签订的军事同盟条约所引起的。
    美日反动派作贼心虚，它们在缔结公开以中苏及亚洲人民为敌的军事同盟条约的时候，曾煞费苦心，用一大堆“防卫”、“和平”之类的字眼来装点这个侵略性的军事条约。但是，新条约中却有“为了远东的和平与安全”的说法，这样美日反动派所谓美日“相互防卫”的骗人鬼话便不攻自破了。美日新“安全条约”既然把远东作为它实施的范围，就明显地暴露了这一条约是以在亚洲进行侵略战争为目的的。
    如果说，新“安全条约”中写明“远东”字样就已经使侵略者露出了马脚，那末岸信介之流在国会的答辩就更加原形毕露了。先是，日本外务相藤山显然是有点得意忘形，解释说“日美安全”条约中所提到的“远东”的范围是包括“菲律宾以北、中国沿岸和苏联滨海边区”。这一解释，就不打自招地供认了日美军事同盟的侵略矛头指向哪里，因而立即引起日本国内外正义舆论的激烈谴责。后来，在日本国会内，岸信介在在野党的追究之下，又支吾其词说什么“远东”不包括苏联和中国，但是包括苏联的千岛群岛和中国的金门、马祖。岸信介这种语无伦次的狡辩，实际上使美日反动派的侵略野心欲盖弥彰。连日本资产阶级报纸也认为岸信介是胡说八道。“读卖新闻”就用讽刺的口吻写道：“如果按照日本政府的解释，北朝鲜固然不算远东，至于显示着‘东风压倒西风’的中国等等更不能算远东了。可见，政治日语确是难以捉摸的东西哩！”
    到底奴才不如主子老练。岸信介对“远东”的一再解释并不符合华盛顿方面的心意。据美国通讯社报道，“一直对日本国内的辩论保持着沉默”的美国国务院，终于开了腔。它表示：“不愿意对远东一词下任何严格的定义”。而美国参议院外委会的重要委员更认为“宁可对这个名词不下定义”，“还是像条约中那样用笼统的名词要好些。”
    显然从美国统治集团看来，对“远东”的定义“笼统些”，就能够更灵活些。我说是哪里就是哪里，我要到哪里就到哪里，随心所欲，又何必预先给自己限死了呢？美国对于这种地理名词早就有它“落拓不羁”的解释方法。譬如，按照华盛顿专用辞典的解释，“东南亚”是包括美国、英国和法国在内的，所以它们应当参加东南亚军事集团；北大西洋可以延伸到土耳其和意大利的海岸，所以它们能够成为北大西洋集团的成员。这就是美帝国主义“圈绳定界”的强盗逻辑。日本“读卖新闻”说得好：“从新日美安全条约所说的‘远东’来看，这是美国的‘圈绳定界’的方法。‘圈绳定界’决不是由法律，而是由实力决定的。因此，在美国看来，把这条线硬是划定从哪里到哪里，是愚蠢透顶的。”但是，美国的这种做法也不见得聪明，因为它实际提醒各国人民：应当起来坚决反对美日军事同盟的不仅是日本人民、苏联人民和中国人民而已。
