Seize the Opportunity During Peak Season to Vigorously Promote Livestock Product Procurement
Ningxia, Qinghai, Yunnan and other provinces and regions seize the opportunity to expand sources of goods

    This newspaper reports that the livestock product procurement work in Ningxia, Qinghai, Sichuan, Henan and other provinces (autonomous regions) this year has achieved great results, building on the successful completion of the 1959 procurement tasks. As of February 16, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region had completed 103.02% of its first-quarter procurement plan; Qinghai Province had completed 71.37% of its quarterly procurement plan by February 15.
    The livestock product departments in these regions seized the characteristic of increased poultry and livestock slaughter during the Spring Festival and sent people out to vigorously secure sources of goods. The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Livestock Products Company sent 20 people to various counties for procurement immediately after the Spring Festival. The Wanxian Special District of Sichuan Province put forward the slogan "The procurement volume of pigskins, bristles and casings should be doubled compared with last year, and the total procurement value should be doubled." During the Spring Festival, the output of bristles in Yunyang, Liangping, Zhongxian, Wanxian, Kaixian, Fengjie and other counties increased three times compared with the same period last year, and casings increased by one time. Henan and Hebei provinces have completed their first-quarter procurement plans ahead of schedule. The livestock product procurement work in many counties has not only been widely carried out in the counties, but has also taken root in the people's communes. During the Spring Festival, Fengxi People's Commune in Chao'an County, Guangdong Province, organized more than 270 people to exchange feathers for matches, procuring more than 7,400 jin of feathers.
    Many places have already transferred the procured livestock products in a timely manner.

    This newspaper reports that Yongshan County, Yunnan Province, is actively carrying out livestock product procurement work. Last year, the county slaughtered 20,595 pigs, procuring 8,145 jin of bristles, averaging more than six liang per pig. 18,944 casings were purchased, accounting for 95.5% of the output, basically achieving one casing purchased per pig slaughtered, and all bristles and hairs of the pig were purchased.
    Yongshan County, Yunnan Province, is a mountainous area where various ethnic groups live, located on the south bank of the Jinsha River at the junction of Yunnan and Sichuan, and transportation is inconvenient. The county has a population of 200,000, twelve people's communes, and one hundred and eleven management districts. The distance from the management district to the central store is twenty to eighty li. In the past, no one collected the bristles and casings here. The masses threw the bristles under the eaves and put the casings in the pot. Under the leadership of the Party, in order to carry out the procurement of casings and bristles, the county commercial bureau, in cooperation with the tax department, investigated the distribution of slaughter workers throughout the county, and gradually implemented the method of paying wages with pig intestines and bristles. In the past, slaughter workers received 40 to 50 cents for slaughtering a pig, and the pig bristles and intestines were handled by the pig farmers themselves. Now, when a pig farmer slaughters a pig, he gives the pig bristles and intestines to the slaughter worker in place of the slaughter fee. The slaughter worker sells the pig bristles and intestines to the state at the national purchase price. The general price of intestines and bristles per pig is above 80 cents. Now the phenomenon of broken intestines and moldy bristles has disappeared. The number of bristles produced per pig has doubled compared with the past, and the source of short bristles has been effectively expanded. (Attached photo)

### 趁旺季大抓畜产品收购  宁夏、青海、云南等省区抓紧时机扩大货源

    趁旺季大抓畜产品收购
    宁夏、青海、云南等省区抓紧时机扩大货源
    本报讯　今年宁夏、青海、四川、河南等省（自治区）的畜产品收购工作，在胜利完成1959年收购任务的基础上，又取得了很大成绩。宁夏回族自治区到2月16日止，已经完成一季度收购计划的103．02％；青海省到2月15日，完成季度收购计划的71．37％。
    这些地区的畜产业务部门，抓住春节期间宰杀禽畜多的特点，派人四出大抓货源。宁夏回族自治区畜产公司，春节一过，就派出二十人到各县收购。四川省万县专区提出“猪皮、猪鬃和肠衣收购量要比去年增加一倍、采购总值翻一番”的口号。云阳、梁平、忠县、万县、开县、奉节等县春节期间猪鬃的产量比去年同期提高三倍，肠衣增长一倍。河南、河北省已经提前完成了第一季度收购计划。很多县的畜产品收购工作，不仅在县里普遍开展，还在人民公社扎根。广东省潮安县枫溪人民公社，春节期间组织二百七十多人，用火柴换羽毛，收购羽毛七千四百多斤。
    很多地方已经把收购的畜产品及时调运出来。
    本报讯　云南省永善县积极开展畜产品收购工作。全县去年一年屠宰二万零五百九十五头猪，收购了猪鬃八千一百四十五斤，平均每头猪收购六两多。收购肠衣一万八千九百四十四根，占产量的95．5％，基本上做到宰一猪、收一肠、猪鬃猪毛全部收购起来。
    云南省永善县在云南、四川交界的金沙江南岸，是个各民族杂居的山区，交通不便。全县二十万人口，十二个人民公社，一百十一个管理区。从管理区到中心商店，相距二十华里到八十华里。过去这里的猪鬃和肠衣没有人搜集，群众都把猪鬃扔在屋檐下，肠衣放在锅里头。商业部门在党的领导下，为了开展肠衣、猪鬃的收购业务，县商业局配合税务部门，调查了全县屠宰工人的分布情况，并逐步实行用猪肠猪鬃抵付工资的办法。过去，屠宰工人宰一头猪收四、五角钱，猪鬃猪肠归养猪户自行处理。现在养猪户杀一头猪把猪鬃猪肠代替屠宰费给屠宰工人，屠宰工人按国家收购价把猪鬃和肠子卖给国家，每头猪的肠子和猪鬃一般价格都在八角以上。现在扯断肠子和霉鬃的现象已经没有了，每头猪身上出鬃的数量比过去增加了一倍，并有效地扩大了短鬃的货源。（附图片）
