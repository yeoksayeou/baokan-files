Cattle and Sheep Cover the Mountains,
Cattle and Horses Spread Across the Red River Banks
Honghe County, where the Hani, Yi, Dai, and other ethnic minorities reside on the southern bank of the Red River, saw a net increase of 18.1% in large livestock last year, becoming a red banner in Yunnan Province for the high-speed development of large livestock.

Crossing the Red River and looking south towards the Ailao Mountains, one sees terraces densely covering the foothills and streams crisscrossing the land. This is a natural good pasture. At the beginning of last year, the Red River County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a call to all ethnic groups in the county to develop animal husbandry at high speed. Based on the spirit of the County Committee's instructions, the communes summarized the six major benefits of developing livestock: more fertilizer, more animal power, more grain, more sales to the state, more meat, and more income. This greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of all ethnic groups to develop animal husbandry, and a mass movement for the high-speed development of large livestock quickly unfolded throughout the county. In just three months, the people's communes throughout the county built more than two thousand livestock pens, ensuring that every animal had a pen.

As a result of the county's high-speed development of large livestock, the number of large livestock, such as yellow cattle, water buffalo, and mules, increased from 21,184 to 25,172 in one year. Now, when people come to the southern bank of the Red River, they can hear the Hani and Yi herdsmen's songs everywhere, accompanied by the sound of cowbells and horse bells, echoing between the mountains and valleys.

The Sani People's Praise Song
In the past, Guishan was shrouded in mist,
Today, Guishan shines with red light.
The people's commune has great strength,
Livestock farms are built in the village.
Cattle and sheep in herds, horses in droves,
With livestock, there will be fertilizer; with fertilizer, there will be grain.
This is a praise song by the Sani people of Guishan in Yunnan, extolling the commune's sheep farming. The Sani people have traditionally had the custom of raising sheep. But in the past, whenever the dry season of winter arrived, they had to drive their sheep flocks hundreds of miles to the Red River to graze. Because of the long journey, the shepherds were busy milking the sheep and making milk cakes, and they couldn't take care of the lambs. Therefore, the development of sheep was always very slow.

After the establishment of the people's commune in Guishan, the commune uniformly allocated land to establish a feed base, with an average of one mu of feed for every twenty sheep. From then on, there was no need to drive the sheep flocks to distant places for grazing in winter. The commune also selected commune members who loved livestock to serve as shepherds, implementing group rotation and group management. Therefore, last spring, although the mountains were snow-covered for fifteen days, not a single sheep froze to death in Guishan.

The commune also adopted advanced measures such as multiple births, artificial insemination, and breed improvement, increasing the number of goats and sheep from more than 30,000 in 1958 to nearly 50,000. With the increase in sheep production, the lives of the Sani people have improved, and they sincerely sing the praises of the superiority of the people's commune.

The Skilled Pig-Raising Kucong People
The Kucong people, who recently moved out of the primeval forests of the Ailao Mountains on the Yunnan border and settled down, are a people skilled in raising pigs.

Even when the Kucong people were still living a nomadic hunting life in the primeval forests, they knew the benefits of raising pigs. At that time, the entire property of a Kucong family, apart from a crossbow and half a broken pot, was a sow. When they failed to hunt wild animals or gather wild fruits and vegetables, they would kill the pig for food and use the pigskin to keep warm. When the sow gave birth to piglets, they would take the piglets to the Hani or Yao villages on the edge of the forest and exchange them for one or two pieces of old clothing or a little salt to improve their lives.

Raising pigs in the primeval forest was very difficult. The Kucong people lived in small thatched huts covered with banana leaves or bamboo leaves, with people sleeping on one side and pigs sleeping on the other. When the banana leaves withered, the Kucong people moved. Wherever the people moved, the pigs followed.

In recent years, with the care of the Party and the help of the government, the Kucong people have moved out of the forest and settled down, and their tradition of raising pigs has been fully developed. The People's Government provides loans to the Kucong people every year as funds for buying pigs. Han, Dai, Hani, and other ethnic minority cadres working in the Kucong area also teach their pig-raising experience to their Kucong brothers. Now, every Kucong family has built pigsties next to their homes, and the cooperatives have also established collective pig farms. In addition to making full use of wild feed in the mountains, they also grow large quantities of various melons and vegetables as pig feed. The pigs are raised in large numbers and are very fat. The Kucong Dazhai has 67 households, raising a total of 203 pigs, an average of more than three pigs per household. This has played a significant role in improving the lives of the Kucong people and changing the backward economic outlook of this ethnic group. Now, every Kucong village often sells a large number of fat pigs to the nearby Han, Dai, Hani, and other ethnic groups and government agencies, and buys back the production tools and daily necessities they need.

Bullfighting Selection
Bullfighting selection is an ancient cultural activity passed down in Yi history.

Every year during the Beginning of Autumn and the Torch Festival, Yi men, women, and children dress in festive attire, lead their cattle, and come to the grasslands in the wild to "compete" with the cattle from neighboring villages. Once the victory or defeat of the two bulls in the fight is determined, people immediately pull them apart. At this time, the audience cheers and applauds, and red silk is placed on the horns of the "hero" bull. On the Beginning of Autumn last year, on the Xiaoliangshan grassland near the Samiro Management Area of the Hekou Commune in Xundian County, there were several hundred pairs of well-fed and powerful cattle fighting simultaneously, raised in the Samiro, Haidian, and three or four other management areas, with thousands of spectators. Since the Great Leap Forward and communization, "bullfighting" has actually become a competition for Yi commune members to select breeding bulls and evaluate the raising of draft cattle. It has prompted everyone to care more about livestock and raise them carefully. Now, more than 30 bulls in the Samiro Management Area were selected in "bullfights" and are specially fed, each with a neck as thick as a bucket.

    牛羊满山猪满栏
    牛马遍布红河岸
    位于红河南岸的哈尼、彝、傣等兄弟民族聚居的红河县，去年大牲畜净增18．1％，成为云南省高速度发展大牲畜的一面红旗。
    渡过红河，举头南望哀牢山，只见山麓梯田密布，溪水纵横，这里是一片天然的好牧场。去年年初，中共红河县委向全县各族人民发出了高速度发展畜牧业的号召。各公社根据县委指示的精神，总结出了发展牲畜的六大好处：肥料多、畜力多、粮食多、出售给国家的多、肉食多、收入多。大大激发了各族群众发展畜牧业的积极性，接着一个高速度发展大牲畜的群众运动很快就在全县范围内蓬勃展开了。全县各族人民公社在短短三个月内，就修建起了两千多座畜厩，做到头头牲畜有厩关。
    全县开展高速度发展大牲畜的结果，在一年内，黄牛、水牛、骡马等大牲畜就由二万一千一百八十四头，增加到二万五千一百七十二头。现在，人们来到红河南岸，到处都可以听见哈尼人和彝人的牧歌，伴随着牛马的铃铛声，回荡在千山万谷之间。
    撒尼人的赞歌
    昔日圭山雾茫茫，
    今日圭山闪红光。
    人民公社力量大，
    寨上建起畜牧场。
    牛羊成群马成帮，
    有畜必会肥，畜肥必有粮。
    这是云南圭山撒尼人歌颂公社养羊的一支赞歌。撒尼人历年来就有饲养羊只的习惯。但在过去，每当水枯草衰的冬天到来，他们只好把羊群赶到几百里外的红河边上去放牧。由于路途遥远，牧羊人顾着挤羊乳炼乳饼，就顾不上保护小羊羔。因此，羊的发展速度一直很慢。
    圭山建立人民公社后，公社统一划出土地建立了饲料基地，平均每二十只羊就有一亩饲料。从此，冬天也不必把羊群赶到很远的地方放牧了。公社又挑选了爱护牲畜的社员担任牧羊人，实行分群轮放，分群管理。因此，去年春天，虽然大雪封山十五天，但圭山上没有冻死一只羊。
    公社还采取了多胎高产、人工授精、改良品种等先进措施，使山羊和绵羊由1958年的三万多只增加到将近五万只。羊只增产了，撒尼人的生活改善了，他们衷心地歌颂人民公社的优越性了。
    善于养猪的苦聪人
    才从云南边疆哀牢山的原始森林中搬出定居不久的苦聪人，是一个善于养猪的民族。
    苦聪人还在原始森林里过着游猎生活时，就知道养猪的好处了。那时，一家苦聪人的全部财产，除了一张弩弓，半边破锅以外，就是一口母猪。当万一猎获不到野兽或采集不到野果、野菜的时候，他们就杀猪来充饥，用猪皮围在身上御寒。母猪生了小猪，他们便抱着小猪到森林边缘的哈尼族或瑶族寨子去，换回一两件破旧衣裳或者换一点盐巴，改善自己的生活。
    在原始森林里养猪是很困难的。苦聪人那时都住在用芭蕉叶或竹叶盖的小草棚里，人睡一边，猪睡一边。等到芭蕉叶枯黄了，苦聪人就搬家。人搬到哪里，猪也跟着走到哪里。
    最近几年，苦聪人在党的关怀和政府帮助下，陆续出林定居，他们善于养猪的传统得到了充分的发挥。人民政府每年都要贷款给苦聪人作买猪的资金。在苦聪地区工作的汉族、傣族、哈尼族等民族干部也把他们的养猪经验教给苦聪兄弟。现在，每家苦聪人都在自己的住宅旁边，盖起了猪厩，合作社还办了集体的养猪场。他们除充分利用山区的野生饲料外，还大量种植各种瓜菜作猪的饲料。猪养得又多又肥。苦聪大寨六十七户人家，共养猪二百零三头，平均每户三头多。这对改善苦聪人的生活和改变这个民族的落后经济面貌起了很大的作用。现在，每个苦聪村寨都经常把大量的肥猪卖给附近的汉、傣、哈尼等民族和政府机关，买回自己需要的生产工具和生活用品。
    斗牛选种
    斗牛选种是彝族历史上流传下来的一种古老的文娱活动。
    每逢立秋、火把节等节日，彝族男女老幼便穿起节日的盛装，牵上牛，来到野外的草坪上，与邻近村子的牛进行“比武”。两头牛格斗的胜负一经看出，便立即有人拉开，这时观众喝采、鼓掌，给“英雄”牛的角上戴上红绫。去年立秋那天，在寻甸县河口公社撒米罗管理区附近的小凉山草地上，就有撒米罗、海甸等三、四个管理区饲养的几百对膘足力大的牛在同时格斗，观众有上千人。大跃进、公社化以来，“斗牛”实际上已成为彝族社员挑选种牛和饲养耕牛的评比竞赛。并促使大家对牲畜更加关心，精心饲养。现在，撒米罗管理区的三十多头公牛，都是在“斗牛”中选出来的，并且有人特别加以喂养，个个脖子有水桶那样粗壮。
