    Reclaim Wastelands and Barren Hills for Grain
    Henan and Guangdong Vigorously Reclaim Land to Expand Cultivated Area
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 20th – People's communes in various parts of Henan Province are vigorously reclaiming wasteland and utilizing abandoned land to expand the spring planting area, striving to increase grain production even more in 1960 on the basis of increasing the yield per unit area of existing cultivated land.
    As early as last winter, many areas in Henan Province conducted investigations and studies on large areas of wasteland and formulated land reclamation plans. Xinxiang and Kaifeng Special Zones, located on both sides of the Yellow River, launched a large-scale land reclamation campaign in conjunction with winter water conservancy construction. In the Xinxiang Special Zone, five counties including Yuanyang, Yanjin, Fengqiu, Changyuan, and Neihuang, are actively reclaiming滩地 of the Yellow River by building field protection dikes and water conservancy projects for both irrigation and flood control. At the same time, they are also using the method of "treating alkali with water" to reclaim some saline-alkali wasteland. Currently, these five counties have newly reclaimed 240,000 mu of wasteland, which has been leveled and equipped with field projects, ready for planting early rice. People's communes in Nanyang and Luoyang Special Zones, encouraged by the slogan "Reclaim hundreds of mu of wasteland in spring, harvest hundreds of shi of grain in autumn," are also organizing professional teams to march into the barren hills and steep slopes. To date, they have reclaimed nearly one million mu of wasteland. The Luoyang Special Zone is striving to complete the reclamation of another 160,000 mu of wasteland before the spring planting.
    While reclaiming large areas of wasteland, various localities are also paying attention to the utilization of scattered wasteland. Lushan County, while undertaking large-scale water conservancy construction and soil and water conservation work, has transformed the river滩地 of twelve rivers and six hundred and ten mountain slopes. In addition, by utilizing abandoned ditches, old roads, field ridges, small scattered wasteland, and previously uncultivable abandoned land, the cultivated area has been expanded by a total of 56,000 mu.
    Socialist cooperation has been launched in various places during the land reclamation campaign. Communes and regions with small land reclamation tasks but with more machinery and labor are actively supporting regions with large land reclamation tasks but with less machinery and labor. People's communes and state-owned farms in Huojia, Tangyin, Anyang, and Xinxiang counties and cities in Xinxiang Special Zone have dispatched 56 tractors and nearly 200 tractor drivers to support Yuanyang, Yanjin, Changyuan, Ji County, Jun County, and Neihuang counties in reclaiming wasteland. Some communes north of the dike in Yuanyang County previously supported communes south of the dike in reclaiming more than 50,000 mu of Yellow River滩地. Now, the communes south of the dike are actively supporting the communes north of the dike in reclaiming saline-alkali wasteland.
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 20th – People's communes in various parts of Guangdong are seizing the favorable opportunity before the busy season of early rice transplanting, on the one hand, vigorously developing high-yield plots to strive to increase yield per unit area; on the other hand, carrying out a mass campaign of crash land reclamation and expansion of planting area. In recent days, 1.37 million people have been mobilized throughout the province to march into the barren hills and wasteland on a large scale. As of February 7, the province had reclaimed 7.62 million mu of wasteland, exceeding the provincial party committee's original requirement of reclaiming 5 million mu this spring. Among them, more than 2.9 million mu have been planted with miscellaneous grains, melons, fruits, sugarcane, and other crops. This achievement has laid a material foundation for achieving a bumper harvest of early crops and a great development of the pig-raising industry. This is a great喜事 for the opening of spring plowing production. At present, various localities are continuing their efforts, reclaiming land and planting crops simultaneously, striving for early planting and a bumper harvest.
    The land reclamation and expansion of planting area campaign in various parts of Guangdong is being carried out in response to the call of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee's telephone conference on January 24, and in accordance with the principle of combining multiple planting and multiple harvesting with high yield and multiple harvesting. Party committees and leading organs at all levels have been leading people's communes to survey wasteland, make unified plans, arrange more labor, and concentrate on crash land reclamation. Many cadres have set up camps on the mountains and led the masses to work hard. After the Spring Festival, Jiangmen Special Zone concentrated more than 420,000 laborers to carry out crash work, reclaiming more than 110,000 mu of land every day. The wasteland that has now been reclaimed in this special zone means an increase of more than 0.15 mu of cultivated land per capita, calculated on the basis of the total agricultural population of the zone.

    向荒山荒地要粮食
    河南广东大力开荒扩大耕地面积
    据新华社郑州20日电　河南省各地人民公社大力开垦荒地和利用废地来扩大春播面积，力争1960年在提高原有耕地单位面积产量的基础上，增产更多的粮食。
    河南省许多地区早在去冬就对大片荒地作了调查研究，并制订了开荒计划。地处黄河两岸的新乡、开封专区，结合冬季水利建设展开了大规模的开荒运动。新乡专区的原阳、延津、封丘、长垣和内黄等五县，在黄河滩里大修护田堤坝和灌溉、防汛两用的水利工程，积极开垦黄河滩地；同时，还用“以水治碱”的办法，开垦一批盐碱荒地。现在，这五个县已新垦荒地二十四万亩，并经过平整和修建了田间工程，准备播种早稻。南阳、洛阳两专区的各人民公社，也在“春季多开百亩荒，秋季多收百石粮”的口号鼓舞下，组织专业队向荒山陡坡进军，到目前止，已经开垦荒地近一百万亩。洛阳专区力争在春播前再完成十六万亩的开荒任务。
    各地在开垦大片荒地的同时，也注意对零星荒地的利用。鲁山县在大兴水利建设和开展水土保持工作时，改造了十二条河流的河滩地和六百一十个山坡，加上利用废沟、旧路、地埂、小片零星荒地及过去不能耕种的废地，共扩大耕地面积五万六千亩。
    各地在开荒运动中展开了社会主义大协作。开荒任务小、机械、劳力多的公社、地区，都积极支援开荒任务大、机械、劳力少的地区。新乡专区的获嘉、汤阴、安阳、新乡等县、市的人民公社和国营农场，抽调了五十六台拖拉机和近二百名拖拉机手支援原阳、延津、长垣、汲县、浚县、内黄等县开垦荒地。原阳县堤北的几个公社前些时支援堤南的公社开垦出黄河滩地五万多亩。现在，堤南的公社又积极支援堤北的公社开垦盐碱荒地。
    据新华社广州20日电　广东各地人民公社抓紧早稻插秧大忙以前的有利时机，一方面大搞丰产方，争取提高单位面积产量；一方面开展群众性的突击开荒扩种运动。连日来，全省出动一百三十七万人，向荒山荒地大举进军。到2月7日止，全省已经开垦荒地七百六十二万亩，超过了省委原定今春开荒五百万亩的要求。其中已有二百九十多万亩种上了杂粮、瓜果、甘蔗等作物。这个成就，为实现早造大丰收和养猪业的大发展打下了物质基础。这是春耕生产开门红的一件大喜事。目前，各地正在再接再厉，边开荒边播种，力争早种丰收。
    广东各地的开荒扩种运动，是响应中共广东省委1月24日电话会议上的号召，根据多种多收和高产多收相结合的方针开展起来的。各地各级领导机关都领导人民公社勘察荒地，统一作出规划，安排较多的劳动力，集中突击开荒。许多干部上山扎寨，带领群众突击。江门专区春节过后，就集中了四十二万多劳动力进行突击，每天开荒达十一万多亩。现在这个专区已开垦的荒地，按全区农业人口平均计算，每人增加耕地五分一厘多。
