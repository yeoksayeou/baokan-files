We Should Like the New and Dislike the Old
Gong Tongwen

"Metabolism," "the alternation of the new and the old," "no new without getting rid of the old," these are objective laws that do not shift with human will. The "new" will not die young because someone dislikes it, and the "old" will not live long because someone likes it. Those who dislike the new and like the old are going against objective laws and are only asking for trouble.

Proletarian revolutionaries like the new and dislike the old, and constantly innovate.

The objective world is constantly developing and changing, renewing itself daily. The subjective world of proletarian revolutionaries is also constantly developing and changing, renewing itself daily.

While transforming the objective world, transform the subjective world. Get rid of the old and welcome the new, bring forth the new from the old.

The new force is invincible. New things emerge in an endless stream. "One day equals twenty years," this is the speed of development and change of the "new." "A scholar who has been away for three days must be looked at with new eyes," this is indeed the case. Between comrades, after a few days apart, they have "new" impressions of each other. Places once thought to be "familiar" become unrecognizable after some time. Li Dagui's experience in diverting water up the mountain in Jun County was still brand new in the winter of 1957. With the passage of time, newer water management experiences have emerged. The "watermelon vine" type water conservancy system in Zhaogang Township, Guanghua County, the experience of comprehensive water, mountain, and soil management in the construction management area of Dayan Commune, Yun County, the experience of self-flowing irrigation with mixed water and fertilizer in Pangong Commune, Xiangfan City... Bring forth the new from the old, renew itself daily. Water is still water, but stagnant water has become living water, and water disasters have become water conservancy, and the content of water conservancy is also renewing itself daily. In the past, water controlled people, but now people control water. Due to continuous innovation, we have gradually achieved the goal of making the most of water. Comparing our current achievements in water management with the achievements of Yu the Great in water management, should we dislike the new and like the old, or like the new and dislike the old? If human society were forever controlled by forces that dislike the new and like the old, then we would probably still be living in caves, eating raw meat, and drinking blood.

In our country, in this great country with 650 million people, it is human nature to like the new and dislike the old. What is the new? It is a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. What is the old? It is a poor and backward country. This feeling of liking the new and disliking the old among the 650 million people is reflected in their daily lives, and especially in their revolutionary actions. At present, the socialist revolution is deepening, and socialist construction is developing. The brilliance of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes illuminates the road of continuous innovation.

The new era, the new society, and the new tasks require each of us to "encourage and inspire," establish new ideas and new styles, boldly innovate, and continuously innovate, to welcome new and greater victories! Therefore, I write a eulogy to the "new."

    应当喜新厌旧
    龚同文
    “新陈代谢”，“新旧交替”，“旧的不去，新的不来”，这是不以人的意志为转移的客观规律。“新”，不因有人厌而夭折，“旧”，不因有人喜而长寿。厌新喜旧者，跟客观规律闹别扭，自找苦吃而已。
    无产阶级革命家喜新厌旧，不断革新。
    客观世界在不断的发展变化，日新月异。无产阶级革命家的主观世界也在不断的发展变化，日新月异。
    在改造客观世界的同时，改造主观世界。去旧迎新，推陈出新。
    新生力量是不可战胜的。新事物是层出不穷的。“一天等于二十年”，这是“新”的发展变化速度。“士别三日当刮目相看”，真是这样。同志之间，隔些日子相见，彼此都有“新”的印象。原来认为是“熟地方”，过些时再去，连路也认不得了。均县李大贵引水上山的经验，在1957年冬季还是崭新的。随着时间的推移，更新的治水经验出现了。光化县赵岗乡的“西瓜秧式”水利系统，郧县大堰公社建设管理区的全面治水、治山、治土的经验，襄樊市庞公公社水肥混合自流灌溉的经验，……推陈出新，日新月异。水还是水，可是死水变成了活水，水患变成了水利，而水利的内容也是日新月异。过去是水治人，现在是人治水，由于不断革新，逐步做到水尽其利了。把我们现在治水的成就和大禹治水的成就相比，我们是应当厌新喜旧还是喜新厌旧呢？如果人类社会永远为厌新喜旧的势力所控制，那么，现在恐怕还是穴居野处、茹毛饮血的时代吧。
    在我国，在这个拥有六亿五千万人民的伟大国家，喜新厌旧，人之常情。新是什么？是具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国。旧是什么？是一穷二白的弱国。六亿五千万人民的这种喜新厌旧的感情，反映在他们的日常生活中，特别反映在他们的革命行动中。在目前，社会主义革命正在深入，社会主义建设正在发展，总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉，照耀着不断革新的道路。
    新时代、新社会、新任务，要求我们每一个人“鼓之舞之”，树立新思想、新风格，大胆革新，不断革新，迎接新的更大的胜利！因作“新”颂。
      （摘自湖北“七一”1960年第一期龚同文：“新”颂）
