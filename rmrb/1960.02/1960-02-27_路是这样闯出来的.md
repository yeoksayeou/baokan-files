This is how the road is blazed
    Who would have thought that the automatic cold cream filling and pressing machine of the Shanghai Daily Chemical Products Factory No. 2 (see the picture above) started from such a "laughable" sketch? Shen Fengxian, a twenty-five-year-old Communist Party member and ordinary packaging female worker who didn't understand mechanical principles at all, filled a letter paper with circles of different sizes. No one could understand such a drawing, but it expressed the strong desire of packaging female workers to get rid of manual operation and change the backward face of production. "A single spark can start a prairie fire." With the strong support of the leadership and the long-term experiments and improvements of many people, the ideal finally became a reality, and an automatic filling and pressing machine was conceived from an unpresentable sketch.

    路是这样闯出来的
    谁能想到，上海日用化学品二厂的冷霜自动灌压机（见上面的照片），是从下面这样一张令人“发笑”的草图开始的呢？根本不懂机械原理的普通包压女工、二十五岁的共产党员沈凤仙，在一张信纸上面画满了大小圈圈。这样的图纸，谁也看不懂，但它却表达了包装女工迫切要求摆脱手工操作，改变落后生产面貌的强烈愿望，“星星之火，可以燎原”。经过领导上大力支持，许多人长时间的试验、改进，终于使理想变成现实，一张不像样的草图中孕育了自动灌压机。
