Xinhua News Agency, Hefei: Anhui Province is preparing to expand the planting area of corn by intercropping, overlapping planting, and increasing planting in vacant land.

Farmers in Anhui Province have a tradition of planting corn for many years. In recent years, various places have used intercropping and overlapping planting of tall-stalk crops such as corn with short-stalk dry crops, achieving many high-yield results. For example, the 3,500 mu of spring corn planted by Gaolou People's Commune in Lingbi County last year were all intercropped with soybeans, yielding an average of 713.8 jin of corn and 200 jin of soybeans per mu. Many places have used the edges of fields, ditch edges, and vacant land around houses to plant corn, which not only does not occupy arable land but also yields a good harvest. Planting corn around the edges and borders of tobacco and cotton fields also provides wind protection.

Currently, the province's plan to expand the planting of spring corn is being arranged in various people's communes. The seeds for expanding corn planting are also being actively prepared. In the work of raising corn seeds, Dangtu County, in addition to leaving good seeds from the commune, also adopted the method of exchanging grain for grain and exchanging at equal value to raise the corn preserved by the members for use as seeds to meet the needs of expanding corn planting. Preparations for fertilizers, agricultural tools, etc., are also better than in previous years. Yuexi County has built fertilizer pits with a capacity of two cubic meters per mu next to the planned cornfields, and at the same time, combined with water conservancy construction, it has accumulated a large amount of pond mud as base fertilizer. In mid-November last year, Yinxian Commune in Shou County organized agricultural technicians, local experts, and iron and wood workers to study the transformation and creation of corn planting tools. At present, four types of tools have been successfully created, including a six-row planter, a bamboo automatic seed dropper, and a seed dropping and fertilizer covering planting cart. After on-site testing and appraisal, it has been shown that the work efficiency is increased by one to three times compared to manual planting.

    安徽扩大种植面积
    据新华社合肥讯安徽省准备用间种、套种、空闲地里增种等方法来扩大玉米种植面积。
    安徽省农民历年都有种植玉米的习惯，近几年来各地用高秆作物玉米同矮秆作物旱粮间种、套种，创造了许多高额丰产的成绩。如灵璧县高楼公社去年种植的三千五百亩春玉米，都是和大豆间种的，平均每亩产玉米七百十三斤八两，产大豆二百斤。许多地方利用田埂、沟埂和家前屋后的空隙地种植玉米，既不占耕地，又获得了丰收。在烟叶、棉花的田埂周围和地边点种玉米，还起了挡风作用。
    现在，全省扩种春玉米的计划正在安排到各人民公社。扩种玉米的种子也在积极准备。当涂县在筹集玉米种子工作中，除从公社留下良种外，还采取以粮换粮、等价交换的办法，将社员私人保存的玉米筹集来做种子，以满足扩种玉米的需要。肥料、农具等准备工作，也比往年做的好。岳西县在计划种植的玉米地旁，都按每亩二立方米容量要求，兴建了沤肥窖，同时结合兴修水利，积了大量作基肥的塘泥。寿县隐贤公社在去年11月中旬就组织农业技术员、土专家和铁木工，研究改造和创制玉米播种工具。目前已创制成功的有六行点播机、竹制自动丢籽器、丢籽盖肥播种车等四种，经实地试验鉴定，比人手点播提高工效一倍到三倍。
