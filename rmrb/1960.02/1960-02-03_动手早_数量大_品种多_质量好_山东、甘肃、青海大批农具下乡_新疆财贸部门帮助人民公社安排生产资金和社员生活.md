Xinhua News Agency, Jinan: Shandong Province's commercial departments are actively taking measures to ensure that the supply of spring plowing production materials is ahead of spring plowing production.

The characteristics of Shandong Province's supply of spring plowing production materials this year are: large quantity, many varieties, good quality, and early time. The province's first-quarter agricultural production materials supply plan increased by 40% compared with the same period last year, among which the main varieties such as chemical fertilizers, chemical pesticides, power machinery, waterwheels, and semi-mechanized farm tools increased by 27% to 44% respectively compared with the same period last year. The supply time is also much earlier than in the past. In previous years, the supply of spring production materials was mostly concentrated in late February and March. This year, the total amount of supply in the first and middle ten days of January increased by 80% compared with the same period last year. At present, the seeds for early spring planting such as spring peas, spring wheat, and spring sweet potatoes have been basically prepared. The Shouzhang County Grain Department has stored more than 30 million jin of peanut, cotton, and sweet potato seeds, which are being transferred to production teams in a continuous stream.

With the increase in the supply of agricultural machinery, new agricultural tools, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers, commercial departments in various places started training technical personnel in the use of various agricultural production materials last winter. The power machinery instructor training class held by the Provincial Department of Commerce has been completed, and the highly toxic pesticide use training class is being planned. After the trainees return here, they will teach the commune members the technology of using power machinery and highly toxic pesticides. New variety experimental fields have been established in various places, and the promotion and rational use of new agricultural tools are organized and guided.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou: Since the fourth quarter of last year, the commercial system of Gansu Province has been digging into the potential of materials on the one hand and organizing production on the other, actively preparing various production materials for spring plowing and spring planting. According to the preparation of goods, the supply of spring plowing production materials in the province this year will be more than doubled compared with last year, and the varieties will increase by more than 40. Cotton sowing machines, rice transplanters, etc., which have never been supplied in the past, have begun to be supplied in batches.

The province's commercial system has cleared warehouses and transported 50,000 mountain plows and seven-inch iron-wheeled plows, 2,500 sowing machines, more than 5,000 waterwheels, 390 cotton sowing machines, as well as power drainage and irrigation equipment such as water pumps and diesel engines, and small farm tools such as iron shovels, hoes, and mattocks, to the countryside. Commercial departments also organized the transfer of spring plowing production materials between counties and communes. Commercial departments in various places also organized factory technicians to repair damaged agricultural tools in communes and production teams. Since October last year, Dingxi Prefecture has adopted this method and has repaired 294,000 pieces of various agricultural tools.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining: The agricultural and pastoral machinery industry department of Qinghai Province has manufactured more than 60,000 pieces of various spring plowing and spring sowing agricultural tools in January this year to supply the countryside.

At the beginning of January, the staff and workers of various agricultural and pastoral machinery factories broke the "routine" that no products were produced at the beginning of the year and continuously produced agricultural and pastoral machinery in batches. By January 27, the Xining Agricultural and Pastoral Machinery Factory had produced more than 1,350 six-row sowing machines, equivalent to three-quarters of the six-row sowing machines produced in the province in the first quarter of last year. Xining Agricultural Machinery Factory has produced a large number of seven-inch walking plows, animal-powered compactors, and various small agricultural tools, and recently successfully trial-produced a tractor-drawn suspended double-blade plow. Various agricultural and pastoral machinery factories also organized working groups to go to the countryside to repair old agricultural tools.

Mechanical factories and other factories that do not specialize in the production of agricultural and pastoral machinery are also doing their best to serve agricultural technological transformation.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi: Financial and trade departments in various parts of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are helping people's communes arrange funds and commune members' lives, prepare production materials, and ensure the smooth progress of spring plowing production.

Banks and credit cooperatives in many areas of the autonomous region have learned from the experience of Jiangyou County in Sichuan Province and have formulated plans to support agricultural modernization this year. After the New Year, cadres from the Turpan County Branch, business offices, and credit sub-bureaus went to various communes and production teams to help arrange production funds and prepare spring plowing production materials.

Commercial employees are stepping up the transfer of production materials. At present, new agricultural tools, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides purchased from all over the country are being transferred. The commercial department has also allocated a batch of steel and flat iron to various places for manufacturing and repairing agricultural tools.

Employees of grain departments in various parts of the autonomous region are helping communes and production teams formulate grain consumption plans, arrange meals in canteens, so that commune members can eat their fill and have sufficient energy to invest in spring plowing production. At present, 70% of the more than 30,000 canteens in various parts of the autonomous region have implemented fixed quotas per person and arrangements for each household.

    动手早　数量大　品种多　质量好
    山东、甘肃、青海大批农具下乡
    新疆财贸部门帮助人民公社安排生产资金和社员生活
    据新华社济南电　山东省商业部门正在积极采取措施，保证春耕生产资料供应工作走在春耕生产的前面。
    山东省今年春耕生产资料供应的特点是：数量大、品种多、质量好、时间早。全省第一季度农业生产资料供应计划比去年同期增长40％，其中主要品种如化学肥料、化学农药、动力机械、水车、半机械化农具等，分别比去年同期增长27％到44％。供应的时间也比以往大大提前，往年春季生产资料的供应大都集中在2月底和3月份，今年1月上、中两旬供应的总金额就比去年同期增长了80％。目前供应早春播种的春豌豆、春小麦、春地瓜等种子已基本备齐。寿张县粮食部门储备的花生、棉花、地瓜种子三千多万斤，已经源源向生产队调运。
    随着农业机械、新式农具、农药、化肥供应量的增加，各地商业部门从去年冬季就着手训练使用各种农业生产资料的技术人材。由省商业厅举办的动力机械师资训练班已经结业，剧毒农药使用训练班正在筹备开课，学员们在这里学习回去后，将向社员传授使用动力机械和剧毒农药的技术。各地普遍建立了新品种试验田，组织指导新农具的推广和合理使用。
    据新华社兰州电　甘肃省商业系统从去年第四季度以来，一手挖掘物资潜力，一手组织生产，积极为春耕春种准备各种生产资料。根据货源准备情况，今年全省的春耕生产资料供应数量比去年增加二倍以上，品种增加四十多种，过去从未供应过的棉花播种机、水稻插秧机等已开始成批供应。
    全省商业系统清理了仓库，将库存的五万部山地步犁和七寸铁辕犁、二千五百部播种机、五千多部水车、三百九十部棉花播种机，以及水泵、柴油机等动力排灌设备和铁锹、镐头、镢头等小农具，源源运往农村。商业部门还组织县与县、社与社之间调剂春耕生产资料。各地商业部门还组织工厂技术工人到公社、生产队修配残损农具。定西专区从去年10月以来采取这个办法，已修配各种农具工具二十九万四千件。
    据新华社西宁电　青海省农牧机械工业部门，今年1月已经制造出六万多件各种春耕春播农具供应农村。
    1月初，各农牧机械工厂的职工就破除了历年年初不出产品的“常规”，接连不断地成批制出农牧机具。西宁农牧机械厂到1月27日已制出一千三百五十多部六行播种机，相当于去年第一季度全省生产的六行播种机的四分之三。西宁农业机械厂已生产大批七寸步犁、畜力镇压器和各种小型农具，最近又试制成功由拖拉机牵引的悬挂式二铧犁。各农牧机械工厂还组织工作组，到农村巡回修理旧农具。
    不是专门生产农牧机具的机械厂和其他工厂，也尽力为农业技术改造服务。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐电　新疆维吾尔自治区各地财贸部门，帮助人民公社安排资金和社员生活，准备生产资料，保证春耕生产顺利进行。
    自治区许多地区的银行和信用社学习四川省江油县的经验，已经订出今年支援农业现代化的规划。吐鲁番县支行、营业所、信用分部的干部，新年过后就到各公社、生产队，一面帮助安排生产资金，一面帮助准备春耕生产资料。
    商业职工正在加紧调运生产资料。目前，从全国各地购进的新式农具、化学肥料和农药正在调运。商业部门还拨出了一批钢材、扁铁供给各地制造和修理农具。
    自治区各地粮食部门职工，正在帮助公社、生产队制订用粮计划，安排好食堂饭菜，使社员吃饱吃好，精力充沛地投入春耕生产。现在自治区各地的三万多个食堂中，已有70％实行以人定量、安排到户。
