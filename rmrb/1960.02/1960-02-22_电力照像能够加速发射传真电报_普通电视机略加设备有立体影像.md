    Photoelectric Imaging Can Speed Up Transmission of Facsimile Telegrams
    Ordinary Television Sets Can Display Stereoscopic Images with Minor Modifications
            Automatic Facsimile Machine
    The Soviet Union has newly developed a "Prism" brand facsimile machine (see picture above). This machine can quickly and accurately transmit written instructions or documents to various enterprises and workshops. You only need to put a piece or roll of paper with words into the transmitter, press a button, and the receiver will automatically print the transmitted written instructions or documents on special chemical paper. Because the receiver can automatically start operating, it can be managed without human supervision.
      Stereoscopic Television Image
    Soviet scientist Academician Mikulin has researched a method to turn ordinary television images into stereoscopic images. According to his method, there is no need to build a special transmitting station to transmit stereoscopic television, and even no need to purchase a special stereoscopic television receiver. Just adding very simple additional components to an ordinary television receiver can create images with a complete sense of three-dimensionality.
    The Soviet "Komsomolskaya Pravda" recently published an article introducing this invention.
    The article described that in Mikulin's room stood a half-new television set. The owner turned on the switch, and the most ordinary television image appeared on the small, completely "old-fashioned" fluorescent screen. Then, Mikulin took out a huge lens to cover the fluorescent screen and asked everyone to look at the mirror placed on the television. As a result, the person on the fluorescent screen seemed to appear somewhere in front of the mirror, and was completely three-dimensional, just like a real person moving in front of the audience, except for a slight bluish glow from the fluorescent screen.
    When explaining why there is a sense of three-dimensionality, Mikulin pointed out that people see things with two eyes, and the angles of the two eyes are different. His method is to try to shift the television image so that two images of the same object appear on it at the same time. For this, a special lens is required. After six years of calculations and experiments, this lens, which can vividly evoke a sense of three-dimensionality, was finally produced.
    According to Mikulin's calculations, the price of such a lens in mass production will not be more expensive than 200 rubles, that is, not much more expensive than the lenses currently used to create magnified images in front of fluorescent screens.

### 电力照像能够加速发射传真电报  普通电视机略加设备有立体影像

    电力照像能够加速发射传真电报
    普通电视机略加设备有立体影像
            自动传真机
    苏联新制成一种“三棱镜”牌传真机（见上图）。这种机器可以使书面指示或文件迅速和准确地传达到各企业和各车间。你只要把一张或一卷带字的纸放进发报机里，按一下电钮，机器就运转起来，收报机就自动把传来的书面指示或文件印在特种的化学纸上。由于收报机可以自动开始运转，所以可以不用人来管理。
      立体电视机影像
    苏联科学家米库林院士研究出了一种使普通电视机影像变为立体影像的办法。根据他的办法，无须建立专门的发射台发射立体电视，甚至无须购置专门的立体电视接收机，只要在普通电视接收机上增加很简单的附加部件，就可以造成具有完全立体感的影像。
    苏联“共青团真理报”最近载文介绍了这项发明。
    文章描述说，在米库林房间里立着一台半新的电视机。主人打开开关，在小小的、完全“老式”的莹光屏上出现了最普通的电视机影像。接着，米库林拿出了一面巨大的透镜遮住萤光屏，要求大家向放在电视机上的镜子看去。结果萤光屏上的人似乎在镜子前的某处出现了，而且完全是立体的，就像真人在观众面前活动，只不过是多了一些萤光屏的微微发蓝的光辉。
    米库林在解释为什么会有立体感时指出，人看东西用两只眼睛，而两只眼睛的角度是不同的。他的办法就是设法把电视形象加以转移，使得在它上面同时出现同一个的物体的两种形象。为此必须要有特制的透镜。经过了六年的计算和试验，终于制成了这种可以生动地引起立体感的透镜。
    据米库林计算，一个这样的透镜在大量生产时价格不会贵于二百卢布，即并不会比目前一般用来放在萤光屏前造成放大影像的透镜贵多少。
