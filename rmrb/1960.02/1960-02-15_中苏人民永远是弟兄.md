    The Chinese and Soviet People Will Always Be Brothers
    Hero of Socialist Labor, Pig Breeder at the "Vanquisher" State Farm in Omsk Oblast, Soviet Union, Peiliexifu Ke
    There is a line in the famous Soviet song "Moscow-Beijing": "The Chinese and Soviet people will always be brothers," which expresses the feelings of our two peoples perfectly. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, signed ten years ago, is a manifestation of this feeling.
    We, the Soviet people, are watching with excitement the great victories achieved by our Chinese brothers. We learn with admiration and pride that People's China has completed its Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, and that the slogan put forward by the Chinese Communist Party, "Catching up with Britain in ten years," is being successfully realized.
    The great goal of our people is to build communism, and this goal has generated great undertakings. As everyone knows, the Soviet people victoriously concluded the first year of the Seven-Year Plan and are now realizing new and higher goals in the second year.
    In recent years, the movement to catch up with and surpass the United States in the production of meat and milk per capita has grown in scale. Collective farms, state farms, districts, and even entire oblasts have proposed guarantees to double or triple meat production within a year. Thousands of breeders have put forward their specific guarantee conditions. They have put forward figures that were unimaginable even a few years ago.
    In the first year of the Seven-Year Plan, I completed the task of raising and delivering 2,000 pigs. If we had used the old methods, it would have been impossible to reach such a number in a year. The staff of our farm eliminated the sties in the pig pens and adopted the method of raising pigs without sties. Using this method, we were able to increase the capacity of pigs by two or three times in the same area. We established the simplest automated systems: automatic drinkers, automatic troughs, and overhead rails for transporting pig feed. In short, the breeders did not have to go to each pigsty to feed them personally. When the time came, a signal was given, and the pigs would go to eat by themselves. In this way, the price of meat became cheaper.
    The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU was convened in December 1959. Before the meeting, I delivered 2,076 pigs to the state, totaling 197 tons of meat. My labor was highly valued. I was invited to participate in the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU. As a breeder for twenty years, I was awarded the honorary title of Hero of Socialist Labor. To repay the care of the Party and the government, I decided to raise 2,200 pigs this year.
    In order to gloriously realize my oath, I am now working tenaciously. The farm is building mechanized pigsties, and I will be able to raise 2,500 pigs as soon as they are completed.
    The reason I talk about myself is because I know that China currently attaches great importance to the development of pig breeding, and I also hope to talk with Chinese comrades about the New Year's plan and share our joy.
    Every rural worker in the Soviet Union hopes that the friendship between our two peoples will be further consolidated. On this day of celebrating the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and mutual Assistance, I would like to extend my best wishes to my Chinese friends who are engaged in the construction of New China.

    中苏人民永远是弟兄
    苏联鄂木斯克州“胜利者”国营农场养猪员社会主义劳动英雄佩列希芙科
    在著名的苏联歌曲“莫斯科—北京”里面有一句话：“中苏人民永远是弟兄”，这再好不过地表现了我们两国人民的感情。而十年前签订的苏中友好同盟互助条约，正好是这种感情的体现。
    我们苏联人民怀着兴奋的心情注视着我们中国兄弟所取得的伟大的胜利。我们以赞叹和自豪的心情得知人民中国提前三年完成了第二个五年计划和中国共产党提出的“十年赶上英国”的口号正在顺利地实现着。
    我国人民的伟大目标是建设共产主义，这个目标产生了伟大的事业。大家知道，苏联人民胜利地结束了七年计划的第一年，现在正在实现第二年新的、高的目标。
    在最近几年，使肉类和牛奶的生产按人口平均计算赶上和超过美国的运动的规模，越来越大了。集体农庄、国营农场、区甚至整个的州都提出在一年内使肉类的生产增加一两倍的保证。成千上万的饲养员都提出了自己具体的保证条件。他们提出了数年前甚至不可想像的数字。
    在七年计划的第一年，我完成了饲养和交出两千头猪的任务。如果采用旧的办法，一年要达到这么多的头数是不可能的。我们农场的工作人员取消了猪圈里的槛，改用无槛喂养的办法。采用这个办法，能够在同样大的场地里使猪的容量增加两三倍。我们建立了最简单的自动化系统：自动饮水器、自动食槽、输送猪食的吊轨。总之，饲养员用不着亲自到每一个猪舍里去喂，一到时间来一个信号，猪就自己去吃。这样一来，肉的价钱就低廉了。
    1959年12月召开了苏共中央全会。在会议召开之前，我交给国家二千零七十六头猪，共达一百九十七吨肉。我的劳动得到了很高的评价。我被邀请参加了苏共中央全会。作了二十年饲养员的我，荣获了崇高的社会主义劳动英雄称号。为了报答党和政府的关怀，我决定在今年饲养两千二百头猪。
    为了光荣地实现我的誓言，我现在顽强地劳动着，农场正在建筑机械化的猪舍，建成后我马上就可以饲养两千五百头猪。
    我所以谈到我自己，是因为我知道目前中国非常重视发展养猪业，我并且希望与中国同志们交谈新年的计划，共享我们的愉快。
    我们每一个苏联农村的劳动者都希望我们两国人民的友谊得到进一步的巩固。在庆祝苏中友好同盟互助条约签订十周年的日子里，我谨向正在从事新中国建设的中国朋友致以最良好的愿望。
