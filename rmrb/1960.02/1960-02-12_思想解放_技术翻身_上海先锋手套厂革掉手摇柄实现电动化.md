    Ideological Liberation, Technological Breakthrough
    Shanghai Pioneer Glove Factory Eliminates Hand Cranks, Achieves Electrification

    (Our report) This newspaper reporter Zhang Yunxiu, Zhou Yongkang reported: Shanghai Pioneer Glove Factory staff vigorously carried out technological innovation, transforming the heavy physical labor of the glove-knitting industry of more than 40 years into electrified production.

    A Major Innovation Was Imperative

    This factory was originally merged from many small handicraft households. All of the factory's more than 100 machines were hand-operated machines from over 40 years ago. To make one glove, it was necessary to crank 233 revolutions. When cranking, the workers had to count with their mouths, and their hands, feet, heads, and waists had to move with the machine. The labor intensity was very high, but the production efficiency was very low. The workers had long hoped that they could one day throw away the hand cranks and electrify the hand-operated machines, but this wish had not been realized in the past. Why? First, everyone felt that gloves were not easy to innovate. Second, everyone believed that the Pioneer Glove Factory's foundation was too weak. There was neither a pair of pliers nor a piece of sheet metal. Not to mention engineers, there wasn't even a single technician. Usually, only two "self-taught" maintenance workers repaired the machines. If the machines were seriously damaged, they had to be taken outside for help. So, as soon as anyone mentioned the four characters "technological innovation," some people would shake their heads. In addition, in the past few years, the factory leadership had also taken some stopgap measures, improved some operating methods. After the public-private partnership, the workers' production enthusiasm greatly increased, and the output also increased year by year. Although there were many demands from all sides, they could barely cope. Therefore, in the minds of some cadres, an optional view of technological innovation was unconsciously generated, and they became somewhat laissez-faire in action.

    In the second half of 1958, various regions vigorously refined steel, built reservoirs, and a large number of tractor drivers appeared in the countryside, all requiring this factory to produce more yarn gloves for them as protective equipment. At this time, the output of the Pioneer Glove Factory had fallen far behind the demand. Some units that wanted gloves simply sent people to sit in the factory and wait. As soon as several dozen pairs were made on the machine, they would take them away. Cadres, seeing all this situation inside and outside the factory, felt that technological innovation needed to be vigorously carried out.

    In March of last year, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened an industrial conference and issued a call to the city's workers to vigorously carry out technological innovation. The Party branch first mobilized everyone to discuss a question: Does the Pioneer Factory have the conditions to carry out technological innovation? The vast majority of people believed that although the Pioneer Factory was "poor," it also had many favorable conditions, and the most favorable condition was that there were particularly many veteran workers. Although they did not understand the principles of machine manufacturing, they had the desire and confidence to transform the machines. The fundamental reason why technological innovation had not been carried out in the past was not that the "material" conditions such as equipment and raw materials were not available, but that people's minds had not been liberated and the masses had not been mobilized.

    The more the ideas were discussed, the more consistent they became, and the greater the enthusiasm of the masses became. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the factory struck while the iron was hot and immediately established a technological revolution research group combining leading cadres, maintenance workers, and production workers. This group trial-produced an electric glove machine before the "May Day" holiday last year, but its manufacturing required too many raw materials and it was not widely promoted. In order to welcome the great 10th anniversary of the founding of the country, the factory leaders mobilized all employees to work together to vigorously promote electrification. The entire factory immediately formed a high tide of technological innovation in which everyone thought of ways and everyone used their brains.

      A Single Spark Starts a Prairie Fire

    Everyone was mobilized to vigorously carry out the technological revolution, and those veteran workers who had been bound to hand-operated machines for many years were particularly eager. An elderly worker named Chen Xuemei was very weak. In the past, she had to take half a month off after cranking gloves for ten days. Years of manual labor had given her a strong desire for electrification, and this strong desire formed a huge force. When she heard that the fingers of the gloves were of different lengths, which made everyone feel that innovation was difficult, she thought about it day and night. One night, she tossed and turned and couldn't sleep. She only heard the clock on the wall strike eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock, and then one o'clock, two o'clock. She suddenly thought: If a clock can strike eleven or twelve times and can control so many unequal sounds, why can't this principle be used to control so many unequal revolutions? The more this old worker thought about it, the more she felt it made sense. She immediately put on her clothes and sat up, and began to draw according to her own ideas. But to draw a picture, this illiterate old worker encountered difficulties again. One day, it happened that a nephew of hers who taught physics in middle school came to see her, and she took this opportunity to ask her nephew to help draw. In this way, she drew early and drew late, and finally drew the picture, and also made a model with waste wood and cardboard. The next day, she excitedly took this innovation proposal, along with the drawings and the model, to the office of the Party branch. No one in the Party branch was not greatly moved by the old worker's suggestion, and immediately shouted about this innovation throughout the factory, widely publicized it, and called on everyone to learn from the old worker Chen Xuemei.

    Chen Xuemei's innovation proposal was like a spark, igniting an even higher flame in the technological innovation movement of the Pioneer Glove Factory. This raging fire of the mass movement burned away countless obstacles on the road to advancement. Converting hand-operated machines to electric power required a lot of manpower and materials. The workers in the workshop took the initiative to propose to the leaders: "If the machines need to be repaired, our blocking car workers will organize their own maintenance team and learn to repair them ourselves during rest time, and draw out the maintenance workers so that they can concentrate on innovation." The table board of the machine was originally supposed to be made of iron plate, but the factory didn't have it, so it was changed to wood. Whatever technological innovation needed, as long as it was broadcast on the broadcasting station, the problem would be solved quickly. The machines needed a batch of "washers," which could not be bought for a while, but copper coins could be used instead. After the workers learned about this from the broadcast, some old female workers went back and found the copper coins that they had put in the bottom of their chests when they got married more than 30 years ago. The next day was the factory's Sunday, and the workers all sent them to the factory. As a result, the number of copper coins sent greatly exceeded the original number needed.

    The entire factory worked together to overcome various difficulties and produced electric machines that were easy to popularize. More than 70 old machines were modified before the National Day last year. By the end of November last year, in just over two months, all 118 hand-operated glove machines in the factory were finally modified, realizing electrification. When the motor drove the pulley to rotate together, and the chain automatically controlled the number of revolutions, many veteran workers burst into tears, and could not help but raise their arms and shout: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party!"

    Now, walking into this factory, you can only see the workers all beaming and walking back and forth easily next to the machines, skillfully dialing the knitting needles for a while, and quickly taking off a glove for a while. Before the innovation, one person could only block one car and was still very tired. Now, one person blocks two cars, but it is very labor-saving.

      Enthusiastic Help

    In the process of the Pioneer Glove Factory's technological innovation, many factories provided enthusiastic support and help. The Qinchang Factory and the Pioneer Factory were only separated by a window. This time, when they heard that the Pioneer Factory was going to get rid of the hand cranks, they took the initiative to run over and ask the Pioneer Factory workers what they were short of and what they needed. The Pioneer Factory wanted a batch of silver dollars, and they immediately sent them over. The Pioneer Factory's welding could not be solved, so they gave up their own tools and materials for the Pioneer Factory to use first. The Pioneer Factory had a batch of parts that the Qinchang Factory could not process, so they went out on behalf of the Pioneer Factory to find cooperative units and solved this problem. Workers from the Shanghai Lighting Factory gave up their rest on Sundays and volunteered to work overtime to help the Pioneer Factory cast sand parts. The Party branch secretary of the Shanghai Dyeing Paper Factory personally wrapped the square iron and punched holes for them. The United Dyeing Factory also drew out carpenters to support the Pioneer Factory.

    The advanced experience of the Pioneer Factory has blossomed and borne fruit all over Shanghai. Now, all of the 1,640 hand-operated glove machines in the city's knitting glove industry have basically achieved electrification. About 80% of the more than 500 hand-operated machines that specialize in knitting fancy gloves have also achieved electric operation. The entire industry's technical appearance has been completely renewed, the labor intensity of workers has been greatly reduced, and labor productivity has generally increased by about one time.

    思想解放　技术翻身
    上海先锋手套厂革掉手摇柄实现电动化
    本报讯　记者张蕴秀、周永康报道：上海先锋手套厂职工大闹技术革新，把织手套行业四十多年来繁重的体力劳动变成了电动化生产。
    大搞革新势在必行
    这个厂原是由许多一家一户的小手工业户合并起来的。全厂一百多台机器，全是四十多年前的手摇机。做一只手套，要摇二百三十三转。摇的时候，工人要用嘴巴计数，手、脚、头、腰都要跟着机器一起动，劳动强度很高，生产效率却很低。工人们早就盼望着能有一天掼掉手摇柄，叫手摇机来个电动化，但是过去这个愿望一直没有实现。为甚么呢？一则大家觉得手套这玩意儿不好革新；二则都认为先锋手套厂的家底实在太薄。没有一把老虎钳，也没有一张铁皮。不要说工程师，连技术员都没有一个。平时修理机器只有两个“半路出家”的保全工，机器坏得厉害点，还得拿到外面请人帮忙修。所以只要谁一提起技术革新这四个字，有些人就会大摇其头。加上过去几年内，厂的领导上也采取了一些治标的办法，改进了些操作方法，工人们在厂公私合营以后，生产热情大大提高，产量也年年有所提高，各方面要货虽多，可是日子还勉强可以对付过去。所以在有些干部的脑子里，无形中对技术革新产生了一种可有可无的看法，行动上也就有点放任自流。
    1958年下半年，各地大炼钢铁，大修水库，农村里大批拖拉机手的出现，都要这个厂拿出更多的纱手套，供他们作为保护用品。这时候，先锋手套厂的产量已经远远的落在需要的后面了。有些要手套的单位，干脆派人坐在厂里等着，机器上做好几打，就先拿走几打。干部们看到厂内外这一切情况，感觉到技术革新需要大搞。
    去年3月间，中共上海市委召开工业会议，向全市职工发出大闹技术革新的号召以后，党支部先发动大家讨论了一个问题：先锋厂究竟有没有条件搞技术革新？绝大部分人认为：先锋厂虽然“穷”，可是有利条件也不少，而最有利的条件就是老工人特别多，他们虽然不懂机器制造原理，但是他们有着改造机器的愿望和信心。过去技术革新没有搞开，根本原因不是设备、原料这些“物”的条件不具备，而是人的思想没有解放，群众没有发动。
    思想认识，愈讨论愈一致，群众干劲，愈讨论愈大。工厂在党支部的领导下，趁热打铁，马上成立了一个领导干部、保全工人、生产工人三方面结合的技术革命研究组。这个组在去年“五一”节前试制成了一台电动手套机，但是制造起来需要原材料太多，没有普遍推广。为了迎接伟大的建国十周年节日，厂领导发动全体职工一起动手大搞电动化。全厂顿时形成一个人人想办法，个个动脑筋的技术革新高潮。
      星火燎原
    人人动手大闹技术革命，而心情特别迫切的要算那些长年束缚在手摇机上的老工人了。有一个叫陈雪梅的老年工人，身体非常虚弱，过去摇上十天的手套，就要请上半个月的假。多少年来的手工劳动，使她对电动化产生了一种强烈的愿望，这种强烈的愿望形成了一股巨大的力量。当听到手套的指头有长有短，使大家感到难以革新的时候，她白天黑夜的想。有一天晚上，她翻来复去睡不着，只听得墙上的挂钟敲十一点、十二点，接着又敲一点、两点，她突然想到：钟能敲十一下、十二下，能够控制多少不等的钟声，为什么不能用这个道理来控制多少不等的转数呢？这个老工人愈想愈对劲，马上披衣坐起来，按照自己的想法开始画。可是要画图，这个一字不识的老工人又遇到了困难。一天，恰好她的一个在中学教物理的侄子来看她，她就趁这个机会请侄子来帮忙画。就这样，她早也画，晚也画，终于把图画了出来，还用废木头、硬纸版做出了模型。隔天，她兴冲冲地把这个革新建议连图带物捧进了党支部的办公室。党支部里没有一个人不为这个老工人的建议大受感动，马上在全厂职工中把这个革新大喊大叫，广泛宣传，号召大家向老工人陈雪梅学习。
    陈雪梅的革新建议正像一颗火花，使先锋手套厂的技术革新运动燃起了更加高涨的火焰。这一把群众运动的烈火，烧掉了前进道路上的无数障碍。手摇机改电动化，要不少人工和材料。车间里工人们主动向领导上提出：“机器要修，我们挡车工自己组织检修队，利用休息时间自己学着修，把保全工人抽出去，让他们专心一志地搞革新。”机台的台板本来要用铁板，厂里没有，便改用木板，凡是技术革新要些甚么，只要广播台上一广播，问题就会很快解决。机器上要一批“华司”，一时又买不到，但是可以用铜币来代替。工人们从广播中知道后，有的老女工回去把三十多年前自己出嫁时压箱底的铜币找了出来。第二天是厂礼拜，工人们都送到了工厂，结果送来的铜币大大超过了原来需要的数目。
    全厂同心协力，冲破了种种困难，制成了便于普遍推广的电动机器，在去年国庆节前就改装了七十多台老机器。到去年11月底，在短短的两个多月内，终于把全厂一百一十八台手摇手套机全部改装完毕，实现了电动化。当马达拖着皮带盘一起转动，链条自动控制着转数的时候，许多老工人热泪盈眶，情不自禁地振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！共产党万岁！”
    现在走进这个工厂，只看见工人们个个满面春风，轻松地在机器旁边来回走动着，一会儿熟练地拨一拨织针，一会儿飞快地取下一只手套。革新前一个人只能挡一台车还很累，现在一个人挡两台车，反而非常省力。
      热情的帮助
    在先锋手套厂革新技术的过程中，许许多多的工厂给予了热情的支援和帮助。勤昌厂和先锋厂之间只有一窗之隔。这次听说先锋厂要革掉手摇柄，就主动跑过来问先锋厂工人缺啥要啥。先锋厂要一批洋元，他们马上送了过来；先锋厂电焊无法解决，他们就把自己工具材料让出来，给先锋厂先用；先锋厂有一批零件，勤昌厂也无法加工，他们就代先锋厂出去找协作单位，解决了这个问题。上海照明厂工人星期天放弃休息，义务加班帮助先锋厂翻砂零件；上海染纸厂党支部书记亲自为他们包方铁，打眼子；联合染厂还抽出了木工支援先锋厂。
    先锋厂的先进经验已在上海遍地开花结果。现在全市针织手套业的一千六百四十台手摇手套机，基本上已经全部实现了电动化；五百多台专门织花色手套的手摇机，实现电动化操作的也已占80％左右。整个行业的技术面貌焕然一新，工人劳动强度大大减轻，劳动生产率一般都提高一倍左右。
