	Three Months Long, Myriad Changes
	Wang Sanming, First Secretary of the CPC Xiangtan County Committee, Hunan Province
	Xiangtan, the hometown of our great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, a place yearned for by the people of the whole country, is now undergoing astonishing changes!
	If you come to Xiangtan, going up the Xiangjiang River, you will first see the newly built dikes, like city walls, protecting the two banks of the river. The light breeze brings the scent of earth, and the stream water flows into the river from the sluice gates with a rushing sound. This is the Nine Great Dikes, which are two hundred li in length. In the deep mountain canyons on both sides of the river, the newly built reservoirs have begun to store water. Under the bright sunshine, the water glistens, and flocks of large white geese and ducklings swim in the water. Spiderweb-like canals are scattered in the fields, and water flows through rice paddies, orchards, newly built pigsties, and newly reclaimed wasteland...
	The barren mountains, which were covered with dense weeds not long ago, have now been turned into terraced fields. The sown wheat, cabbage, and rapeseed have emerged from the soil, and everywhere is a scene of new green. The rapeseed, citrus, pear trees, sapium trees and other seedlings interplanted among the crops have also begun to take root.
	If you had been here three months ago, and then saw the current situation, you would feel how fast the changes are. The myth of "Seven days in the mountains, a thousand years in the world" has appeared in our real life!
	Water is an indispensable thing in people's lives. However, during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the water here was very frightening. The river water rose sharply, mountain floods broke out, and thousands of miles of land became a swamp. Houses were submerged, crops were submerged, and even people were carried away by the water. People who are a little older clearly remember that in the 1926 flood, 900,000 mu of fields were flooded, and hundreds of thousands of people were bankrupted and displaced. However, without rain, without water, the people also suffered. In 1934, it did not rain for seventy-two days, and the land was scorched for thousands of miles. Drought-stricken fields reached 1.2 million mu. Crops withered, and the masses ate tree bark and "immortal soil" to survive. How much disaster did water bring to the people of Xiangtan! For the sake of water, the people shed a lot of blood and tears.
	After liberation, our great Party led the people in agricultural water conservancy construction. The people, with their heads held high and chests out, launched a struggle against water, going from fearing water to controlling it, and using the favorable conditions of mutual assistance and cooperation to build water conservancy projects as much as possible. From then on, water was not as rampant as in the past, and disasters were reduced year by year. But after all, the strength of the advanced cooperatives was still limited, and water and drought disasters had not been fundamentally eliminated.
	The emergence of the infinitely vital people's communes has made the people truly the masters of nature, and beautiful ideals have been realized.
	After the horn of marching towards nature was sounded, 200,000 soldiers marched mightily to the mountains and plains, opening mountains and digging rocks to build reservoirs, and opening canals. 90,000 elite soldiers were on the banks of the clear blue river, blocking water and building dikes. How powerful is the mass movement led by the Party! During the day, red flags flutter, and songs shake the mountains; at night, countless seas of fire and fire dragons light up the sky. Reservoirs were built one after another, and canals were opened one after another. The masses led by the Party are the ocean of wisdom. Thousands upon thousands of skillful hands made earth trains, cableways, flying cars... The construction site was mechanized with earthwork, the work efficiency was constantly improved, and difficulties were overcome one by one in front of the heroic people.
	People see further and think more. They not only focus on water storage and drainage, but also look far ahead and observe all directions. People are building power stations on the dams, asking the flowing water heading for the rice paddies to transport generators for people; small factories are being built around the reservoirs, and villages are being built on the "islands" protruding from the center of the reservoirs to develop and utilize the lush mountainous land with water and grass, planting fodder, building pig farms, and chicken farms; large quantities of fish are being raised in the reservoirs, and canals are being used for shipping, so that mountains, water, grass, and trees can all benefit the people, and thousands of reservoirs will become treasure houses.
	After a great battle, all the waters were tamed. 44 million cubic meters of earth and stone were completed, equivalent to the total amount of earth and stone completed in water conservancy projects in the ten years since the county's liberation. Do you know how much time it took? Only two months!
	Mobilizing the myriad waters is still not enough to satisfy the people's demands. People then issued another proclamation to conquer the thousand mountains. The 290,000-strong army, returning in triumph from the water conservancy front, once again beat the drums of war and went to the barren mountains to launch a "mountain management" campaign. The barren mountains that had been sleeping for thousands of years were awakened by the drums of the Great Leap Forward. Today it is a barren mountain covered with wild grass, tomorrow it will be terraced fields, and the day after tomorrow it will be sown with crops and planted with various trees. On the steep and rugged mountains, Masson pines, sapium trees, and oil tea trees are planted; on the protruding hills, oranges, pomelos, walnuts, and pears are planted... Various trees are densely planted on both sides of the highways and railways, and forest belts are interwoven into a network. People climb high mountains, braving the cold wind and rain, wielding silver hoes, and planting seedlings one by one, and people irrigate them with warm sweat.
	"In one month, 250,000 mu of wasteland and 340,000 mu of trees" - people have recorded this achievement in mountain management again.
	"Suddenly, like the east wind blowing overnight, thousands of trees and thousands of pear trees bloom." Xiangtan is leaping forward at high speed! Harmful water has become beneficial water, and 1.23 million mu of fields in the county have basically achieved self-flowing irrigation. Barren mountains have become treasure mountains, and in a while, it will be a scene of lush trees, fragrant flowers, and abundant fruits.
	Three months long, myriad changes. What is the reason for such a huge change? The 800,000 people in our county will answer in unison: the victory of the General Line! The victory of the Great Leap Forward! The victory of the People's Commune!

### 为时三月　变化万千

    为时三月　变化万千
    中共湖南湘潭县委第一书记　王三明
    湘潭，我们伟大领袖毛泽东同志的故乡，这个全国人民所向往的地方，现在，正发生着惊人的变化！
    假如你到湘潭来，溯湘江而上，首先你会看到新筑的河堤，像城墙一样，护着河的两岸，轻风送来了泥土的香味，溪水从闸门哗哗地流入河里。这就是全长二百华里的九大堤。河两岸的深山峡谷里，新建的水库已经开始蓄水了。在灿烂的阳光下，波光粼粼，成群的大白鹅、小鸭在水里游泳。田野里撒着蛛网一般的渠道，水，流过稻田，流过果园，流过新建的猪舍，流过新开的荒地……。
    不久前曾是茫茫宿草的荒山，现在已变成梯田，播种的小麦、白菜、油菜已出土了，到处一片新绿，间作在作物间的油菜、柑桔、梨树、乌桕等树苗也已开始成活了。
    如果你在三个月前来过这里，再看到现在的情况，你将感到变化是多么快。“山中方七日，世上已千年”的神话，在我们现实生活中出现了！
    水，是人们生活中不可缺少的东西。但是，在国民党反动统治时期，这里的水却非常可怕。河水陡涨了，山洪暴发了，千里汪洋，尽成泽国，房子被淹没，庄稼被淹没，甚至连人也给水带走了。年纪稍大一点的人都清楚的记得，1926年涨水，淹田九十万亩，数十万人民倾家荡产，流离失所；可是，不下雨，没有水，人民同样受罪。1934年，七十二天没下雨，赤地千里，受旱田达一百二十万亩，庄稼干死了，群众吃树皮、神仙土度日。水给湘潭人民带来了多少灾难！为着水，人民流了不少的血和泪。
    解放后，我们伟大的党领导着人民从事农田水利建设，人民昂首挺胸和水展开了斗争，从怕水走向治水，利用互助合作的有利条件，尽可能地大兴水利。从此，水不像过去那样猖獗了，灾害逐年减轻了。但毕竟高级社的力量还是有限的，水旱灾还没有从根本上消除。
    具有无限生命力的人民公社的出现，使得人民真正成了自然的主人，美好的理想也得以实现了。
    向自然进军的号角吹响以后，二十万雄兵，浩浩荡荡奔赴高山和原野，开山凿石，修建水库，开渠道。九万精兵，在碧水粼粼的河岸，堵水筑堤。党领导的群众运动，具有多大的威力啊！白天红旗招展，歌声撼山岳；夜晚，无数的火海火龙，火光烛天。水库一座座建立起来了，渠道一条一条开成了。党领导的群众是智慧的海洋。千千万万个巧手，制成了土火车、索道、飞车……工地土机械化了，工效不断提高，困难，在英雄的人们面前一个一个地克服了。
    人们看得更远了，想得更多了，不仅仅把眼光放在蓄水、排灌上，而是高瞻远瞩，观察四面八方。人们在水坝上建立起发电站，叫奔往稻田的流水，为人们运转发电机；在水库周围盖起小工厂，在水库中央突起的“小岛”上，建立起村庄，开发和利用水草丰美的山地，种饲料、建猪场、鸡场；水库中大量地养鱼，利用渠道航运，让山、水、草、木都为人们兴利，千万座水库将变成万宝库。
    一场大战之后，万水驯服了，完成土石方四千四百万立米，相当于全县解放十年来完成水利工程土石方的总和。你知道用了多少时间呢？只有两个月！
    调动了万水，还不能满足人们的要求。人们随着又下了一道征服千山的檄文。从水利战线奏凯而归的二十九万大军，又紧擂战鼓，开赴荒山，开展了“治山”大战，沉睡了几千年的荒山，被大跃进的战鼓震醒了。今天是野草茫茫的荒山，明天是一畦畦的梯田，再过一天就播满了作物，种上各种树木。在峻拔嶙峋的高山上，植上了马尾松、乌桕、油茶；在突起的小山岗上，栽上橘、柚、核桃、梨……公路铁路两旁，密密地植着各种树木，林带交织成网。人们攀上高山，冒着寒风冷雨，飞舞着银锄，树苗一株一株插下，人们用温热的汗珠浇灌着他们。
    “一个月的时间，二十五万亩荒地，三十四万亩树林”，人们又记下了这治山的成绩。
    “忽如一夜东风来，千树万树梨花开”。湘潭在高速度地飞跃！害水变成了益水，全县一百二十三万亩田基本实现了自流灌溉。荒山变成了宝山，再过些时候，就是绿树成荫，花香果茂的境地了。
    为时三月，变化万千。是什么原因促使这样巨大的变化呢？我们全县八十万人民将众口同声地回答：总路线的胜利！大跃进的胜利！人民公社的胜利！
