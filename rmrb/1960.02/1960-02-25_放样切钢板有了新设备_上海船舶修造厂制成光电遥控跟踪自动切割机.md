Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 24th. The Shanghai Shipyard recently successfully designed and manufactured a photoelectric remote control tracking automatic cutting machine, fundamentally changing the situation in the shipbuilding industry where the lofting process could not keep up with other processes due to manual labor. This is of great importance to the high-speed development of the shipbuilding industry.

This photoelectric remote control tracking automatic cutting machine was successfully trial-produced by engineers Yang Junjin, Xie Shunan, technician Tang Jufa, and worker Dai Yuequan, under the leadership of the factory's Party committee. It combines the four manual operations of lofting, punching, blanking, and cutting steel plates into one, greatly reducing the labor intensity of workers and increasing production efficiency by about one-third. In the past, lofting workers squatted on the ground all day long, lofting according to drawings, nailing templates, punching holes, and cutting steel plates, which was inefficient and very laborious. Now, with the machine, workers only need to press the button on the console, and the photoelectric beam emitted by the machine will automatically track the lines on the drawing, advancing or turning. At the same time, the "gas cutting torch," which is far from the console, will emit a strong flame, automatically cutting the steel plate according to the drawing.

    放样切钢板有了新设备
    上海船舶修造厂制成光电遥控跟踪自动切割机
    新华社上海24日电　上海船舶修造厂最近设计制造成功一种光电遥控跟踪自动切割机，从根本上改变了造船工业中放样工种因手工劳动而跟不上其它工种的局面，对高速度发展造船工业有重要的作用。
    这台光电遥控跟踪自动切割机，是由工程师杨君劲、谢树南，技术员汤聚法和工人戴岳泉，在工厂党委领导下试制成功的。它使放样、钉眼、下料、切割钢板等手工操作的四道工序合而为一，大大减轻了工人的劳动强度，生产效率也提高了三分之一左右。过去，放样工人成天蹲在地上，根据图纸放样、钉样板、打眼子、切割钢板，效率不高，而且很费力；现在有了机器，工人们只要揿一下操纵台上的电钮，机器上射出的光电就会自动跟踪着图纸上的线条前进或转弯，与此同时距离操纵台较远的“气割龙头”就喷射出强烈的火舌，自动按照图纸裁剪钢板。
