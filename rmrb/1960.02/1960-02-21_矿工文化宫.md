    Miners' Cultural Palace
    Not long ago, a mining town appeared in the village of Těrčí cǎi in the Bardubice region of Czechoslovakia. This mining town was built according to modern requirements. The residences are very bright, the lawns in front of the houses are lush green, and the town also has a network of shops and social service agencies. However, people here had no place to gather, nor did they have a place for collective entertainment and learning. Only televisions and radios provided residents with culture and entertainment. To see dramas and listen to concerts, residents had to take a bus to the state capital of Bardubice. In order to meet the residents' demands for cultural life, the new building of the "Revolutionary Trade Union Movement Factory Club" was built in this town a year ago, and since then the residents of the town have been able to engage in various cultural activities here. From the first day of its opening, the club became a meeting place for the town's workers and the workers of the manganese and pyrite ore dressing plants near Hvaleticai.
    This club—or cultural palace—has a large theater, a cinema hall, many recreation rooms, a puppet theater, a laboratory for photography and film photography enthusiasts, a lounge, a coffee room, and a restaurant.
    Now, going to the club has become a habit, and people feel like they are at home there. In the club, they can meet people with similar interests, such as chess players in front of chessboards, music lovers in singing groups, and also combine paints and plasticine with painting and sculpture enthusiasts, where they can carry out various creative activities. In addition, various celebrations, reports, dances, and concerts can also be held here with warm friendship. Of course, other forms of cultural activities are also carried out in the cultural palace.
    In less than half a year, the factory club has received tens of thousands of viewers. Many people, after coming here once or twice, have become regulars of the club. Going to the club has become an indispensable part of life. (Star) (Attached picture)

    矿工文化宫
    不久以前，在捷克斯洛伐克巴尔杜皮采州的捷尔奇采村出现了一座矿工镇，这座矿工镇是按现代要求建立起来的，住宅非常明亮，屋前草地绿草如茵，镇上还建有商店和社会服务机构网。可是，这里人们没有可以集会的地方，也没有进行集体娱乐和学习的地方，只有电视机和收音机向居民提供文化和娱乐。镇上居民要看剧和听音乐会，不得不乘车到州城巴尔杜皮采去。为了满足居民对文化生活的要求，一年前在这个镇上建筑了“革命工会运动工厂俱乐部”的新大楼，从此镇上的居民就可以在这里从事各种文化活动了。俱乐部从开幕的头一天起，就成了镇上职工同赫瓦列齐采附近锰矿和黄铁矿各选矿厂职工会见的地方。
    这个俱乐部——或者称它为文化宫——有大剧场、电影厅、许多游艺室、木偶剧场、摄影和电影摄影爱好者的实验室、休息厅、咖啡间和餐厅。
    现在，人们到俱乐部去已经成了习惯，感到在那里就像在自己家里一样。在俱乐部，他们可以遇到兴趣相同的人，如棋盘前的棋手，歌咏小组的音乐爱好者，并且也把颜料和塑泥同绘画和雕塑爱好者结合在一起了，可以进行各种创作活动。此外，也可以在这里友情洋溢地举行各种庆祝活动，听报告，参加舞会和音乐会等。当然，在文化宫里还进行一些其它形式的文化活动。
    在不到半年的时间内，工厂俱乐部已接待了十几万观众。许多人来到这里一两次之后，就成了俱乐部的常客。人们到俱乐部去，已经成为生活中不可缺少的了。　（星）（附图片）
