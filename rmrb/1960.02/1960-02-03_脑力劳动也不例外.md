    Mental Labor Is No Exception
    Jing Yu
    In this era of liberating thought, great competitions, and continuous leaps forward, design work in basic construction must also keep up to meet the needs of the leap forward. Can design workers throw themselves into the torrent of mass movements, also engage in great competitions, and accelerate the pace of design work? In the Anshan Coking and Refractory Materials Design Institute, some people believe it cannot be done. Some of the reasons given are: First, design work is a complex mental labor, and mental labor is an activity of "brain cells," which is difficult to express through competitions; second, mental labor requires a relatively quiet environment for thinking, while mass movements inevitably disrupt people's thinking and work processes, reducing work efficiency.
    Mental labor certainly has its characteristics, but mental laborers cannot remain outside the mass movement. Firstly, although mental labor falls into the category of complex labor, the result of the labor must ultimately be expressed through words or patterns. Why can't the results of thinking and what has already been expressed be compared with the works of others? Secondly, design work in mental labor certainly requires a certain work process, but the most important aspect of this process is to consult with the masses more often, absorb the wisdom of the masses, and improve one's work. Things are created by the masses, so why can't we participate in mass movements and learn from the masses? Thirdly, no matter how complex the design work may be, since liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward, people have accumulated a lot of experience. Why can't we mobilize the masses, summarize experiences, find patterns, and speed up the pace of work?
    Vigorously launching mass movements is the main method for promoting the high-speed development of social production. Years of experience have proven that mass movements are not only applicable to production departments but also to all economic and work departments. Now, isn't the mass technical performance competition movement of Anshan Iron and Steel Company already being promoted to many departments? Anshan's design departments have made full use of various complete sets of advanced experiences, avoiding repetitive labor in design work, and the design speed has increased by more than one time. In the past, Anshan civil engineering and construction designers always found it very complicated to calculate the load on the crane beam frames of factory buildings. However, in the mass technical performance competition movement, they summarized past experiences and created special slide rules and charts, which could be calculated in a few minutes. How do the people in Anshan's design departments view this matter? Please read the song they composed: "Old Wang used to calculate frames, sweat soaked his white jacket, three days and three nights seeking a 'y', calculating back and forth still finding errors. Young Wang calculates frames today, conveniently checks the charts; no need for three days and three nights, calculated in an instant." This simple song describes the changes before and after the vigorous development of mass movements and technological innovations, and how much the vigorous development of mass movements and technological innovations are needed by mental laborers.
    The era of mental laborers building cars behind closed doors has passed. The current era is the era of mass movements to break superstitions, liberate thought, and engage in great competitions. If mental laborers truly want to contribute to the cause of socialist construction, they must put down their airs, abandon the viewpoint of exceptionalism, and go to the mass movement to train and improve themselves. Marxists and Leninists believe that all revolutionary undertakings and all construction undertakings must vigorously develop mass movements, and mental labor is certainly no exception.

    脑力劳动也不例外
    静宇
    在解放思想、大比大赛、连续跃进的年代里，基本建设的设计工作也要赶上去才能适应跃进的需要。设计工作人员能不能投入群众运动的洪流，也来一个大比大赛，加快设计工作的速度呢？鞍山焦化耐火材料设计院中，有人认为不能。有人所持的理由是：一、设计工作是个复杂的脑力劳动工作，脑力劳动是“脑细胞”的活动，很难用竞赛的形式来表现；二、脑力劳动要有比较安静的环境来思考，而群众运动难免要打乱人们的思考程序和工作程序，降低工作效果。
    脑力劳动固然有它的特点，但脑力劳动者却不能置身于群众运动之外。其一：脑力劳动虽然属于复杂劳动的范畴，但是，劳动的结果，最后总要通过文字或图案表达出来；为什么不可以把思考的结果和已经表达出来的东西同别人的作品比较比较呢？其二：脑力劳动中的设计工作，固然要有一定的工作程序，但是，这些程序当中最重要的一项，毕竟还是要多多同群众商量，吸取群众的智慧，改进自己的工作。事物是群众创造的，为什么就不能参加群众运动向群众领教呢？其三：设计工作尽管如何复杂，但是，解放以来，特别是大跃进以来，人们已经积累不少的经验，为什么不能发动群众，总结经验，找出规律，加快工作的速度呢。
    大搞群众运动，是推动社会生产高速度向前发展的主要方法。几年来的经验证明，群众运动不仅适用于生产部门，而且也适用于一切经济部门和一切工作部门。现在，鞍山钢铁公司的群众性技术表演赛运动，不是已经推广到许多部门了吗？鞍山设计部门充分利用各种成套的先进经验，避免了设计工作重复劳动，设计速度提高一倍以上。鞍山土木建筑设计人员过去计算厂房吊车梁排架的荷重，总觉得非常复杂。但是，在群众性的技术表演赛的运动中，他们总结过去经验，制造了专门的计算尺和图表，几分钟之内就算出来了。鞍山设计部门的人员用什么样的心情看待这件事情呢？请看他们编的歌：“老王过去算框架，汗水湿透白小褂，三天三夜求个y，算来算去还出差。小王今天算框架，顺手只把图表查；不用三天和三夜，转瞬之间算好啦”。这一首朴素的歌，写出了大搞群众运动和技术革新前后的变化，写出了大搞群众运动和技术革新对于脑力劳动者是多么的需要。
    脑力劳动者闭门造车的时代已过去了。现在的时代是破除迷信、解放思想、大比大赛的群众运动的时代。脑力劳动者真正要在社会主义建设事业中有所贡献，必须放下架子，抛弃特殊论的观点，到群众运动中去锻炼自己，提高自己。马克思列宁主义者认为：一切革命事业和一切建设事业都必须大搞群众运动，脑力劳动当然也不例外。
