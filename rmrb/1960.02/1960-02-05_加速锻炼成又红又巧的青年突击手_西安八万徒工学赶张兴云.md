    Accelerate Training to Become Red and Skilled Youth Shock Troops
    80,000 Apprentice Workers in Xi'an Learn From and Catch Up With Zhang Xingyun
    (By our newspaper) Xi'an Municipal Industrial and Basic Construction units are deeply engaged in a movement involving over 80,000 apprentice workers to learn from, catch up with, and surpass Zhang Xingyun, focusing on improving technical proficiency and establishing a good work ethic.
    In Xi'an, apprentice workers currently account for one-third of the total workforce. Most of them entered the factories at the end of 1958, and they made great progress last year. The vast majority can now operate independently. However, most are still not proficient in their skills, resulting in low labor productivity, poor product quality, and frequent accidents. This is currently a weak link in the city's industrial production. The Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China regards rapidly improving the technical level of apprentice workers as an important measure to increase labor productivity and achieve "increased production without increasing manpower." The Xi'an Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League convened a citywide apprentice worker representative meeting in mid-November last year, launching a movement to learn from Zhang Xingyun, a female apprentice worker at the Yellow River Machine Factory.
    Various factories have launched this movement in conjunction with annual learning summaries. During these summaries, the apprentice workers carried out a "five recollections, three solicitations" campaign. They recalled and examined their ideological progress, work attitude, technical learning, task completion, and respect for their masters since entering the factory a year ago. At the same time, they solicited opinions from their masters, team leaders, and classmates. Some factories also conducted technical tests for the apprentice workers. Many factories invited Zhang Xingyun to the factory to give reports to the apprentice workers. Through the "three solicitations, five recollections," the apprentice workers compared themselves with Zhang Xingyun, identified their ideological shortcomings and technical deficiencies, formulated learning plans, and pursued Zhang Xingyun. Yu Shiying, an apprentice worker at the Xi'an Electrical Wire Factory, became complacent because he had overcome the quality key of enameled wire and became disrespectful to his master. After listening to Zhang Xingyun's report, he said, "Look at how humble she is despite such great achievements! I shouldn't be complacent!" He made a self-criticism to his master, became respectful, adopted a good learning attitude, worked conscientiously, and actively helped others who had made the same mistake. He is now an excellent apprentice worker.
    Various factories have also widely established model apprentice workers within their own plants. Currently, there are 2,262 model apprentice workers in the city, providing a role model for apprentice workers in every trade. The Shaanxi Agricultural Machinery Factory formed a model team of twelve factory-level apprentice worker models to give reports and perform for the apprentice workers, promoting the development of labor emulation.
    After in-depth mobilization, the vast number of apprentice workers plunged into a surge of competition to improve their technical level, launching a movement to compare, learn, catch up, and help each other by trade and industry. Various factories have adopted many forms of competition according to different situations, such as head-to-head competitions, relay races, and technical performance competitions. In December of last year, the Shaanxi Agricultural Machinery Factory conducted 27 technical performance competitions, and 80 "thousand-minute shock troops" who exceeded their shift quota by 100% emerged from among 800 apprentice workers. Some apprentice workers previously believed that "we haven't mastered our skills yet, so we don't have a part in technical innovation." This time, they learned from Zhang Xingyun's spirit of daring to think and act, liberated their minds, and actively engaged in the technical innovation movement. Since the launch of the movement to learn from Zhang Xingyun at the Yellow River Machine Factory, apprentice workers have implemented 2,891 technical innovation projects in just over two months, equivalent to two and a half times the total number of innovations made by apprentice workers in the previous ten months. In the competition, apprentice workers competed and helped each other, improving together. Liu Meilian, Pan Chunhua, Chen Zaishun, and other apprentice workers who were technically weaker or ideologically backward, all became red banner bearers within the factory with Zhang Xingyun's help.
    In the movement to learn from, catch up with, and surpass Zhang Xingyun, the apprentice workers' ideological awareness and work attitude have greatly improved. According to a survey conducted in early January, among the 125 apprentice workers at the Qing'an Machine Factory who were ideologically or technically backward and often failed to complete their production tasks, 105 were able to complete their tasks after this movement, and their work and learning attitudes had significantly changed. Among them, 84 submitted written guarantees to strive for progress in ideology, technology, and work, 36 applied to join the Communist Youth League, and 35 were rated as excellent apprentice workers.
    The movement to learn from, catch up with, and surpass Zhang Xingyun has already played an important role in Xi'an's industrial production. According to statistics from the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League on 37 large factories, in the first 20 days of January, apprentice workers innovated 30,100 technologies, more than twice the number of innovations made in the entire year of 1959. According to incomplete statistics from the Youth Workers Department of the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League (excluding the textile system), more than 53,000 apprentice workers completed their January plans more than one week ahead of schedule, and the situation of low labor productivity among all employees in the city has significantly changed.

    加速锻炼成又红又巧的青年突击手
    西安八万徒工学赶张兴云
    本报讯　西安市各工业和基本建设单位八万多徒工，正在深入开展以提高技术熟练程度和树立良好的劳动态度为内容的学、赶、超张兴云运动。
    西安全市的工人中，目前有三分之一是徒工。他们大都是1958年底入厂的，去年一年有很大的进步，现在绝大多数已经能够独立操作。但是，大部分人技术还不熟练，劳动生产率低，生产出的产品质量低，事故多。这是目前全市工业生产中的一个薄弱环节。中共西安市委把迅速提高徒工的技术水平，作为提高劳动生产率，实现“增产不增人”的一个重要措施。西安市总工会和共青团西安市委在去年11月中旬召开了全市徒工代表会议，发起了学习黄河机器厂女徒工张兴云的运动。
    各个工厂都是结合一年学习总结开展了这一运动。徒工们在学习总结当中，开展了“五回忆、三征求”运动。他们自己回忆检查进厂一年来的思想进步、劳动态度、技术学习、任务完成和尊敬师傅方面的情况，同时征求师傅、小组长和同学的意见。有的厂还同时进行徒工技术测验。许多厂邀请张兴云到厂向徒工作了报告。徒工们通过“三征求、五回忆”，同张兴云对比，根据自己思想上的缺点、技术上的不足之处，订出学习计划，追赶张兴云。西安电鑬厂徒工于世瀛，因为攻破了漆包线的质量关键，产生了自满情绪，对师傅也不尊重了。他听了张兴云的报告以后说：“看人家那么大的成绩，还那么虚心，我自满可不应该！”他找老师傅作了检讨，作到尊敬师傅，学习态度好，工作认真，并且主动帮助犯了同样毛病的人。他已经是一个优秀徒工。
    各个厂还普遍树立了本厂的徒工标兵。目前全市的徒工标兵已有二千二百六十二人，使各个工种的徒工都有了学习的榜样。陕西农业机械厂把十二名厂级徒工标兵组成标兵表演团，向徒工们作报告，巡回表演，推动了劳动竞赛的开展。
    各厂经过深入动员，广大徒工投入了提高技术水平的竞赛热潮，分工种、按行业开展了比、学、赶、帮的运动。各厂根据不同情况，采取了许多种竞赛形式，如对手赛、接力赛和技术表演赛等。陕西农业机械厂在去年12月份开展了27次技术表演赛，在八百名徒工中出现了八十名每班超产一倍的“千分钟突击手”。以前有些徒工认为：“咱们学习还没有学到家，技术革新没有份”。这次，他们学习了张兴云敢想敢干的精神，解放了思想，积极投入技术革新运动。黄河机器厂全厂徒工开展学习张兴云运动以来，两个多月共实现了二千八百九十一项技术革新项目，相当于以前十个月徒工革新总数的两倍半。竞赛中，徒工们既赛又帮，共同提高。张兴云帮助的刘美莲、潘春华、陈在顺等几个技术较差或者思想比较落后的徒工，都已成了厂内的红旗手。
    在学、赶、超张兴云运动中，徒工们的思想觉悟和劳动态度有很大进步。庆安机器厂一百二十五名思想或技术比较落后、常完不成生产任务的徒工，经过这次运动，据1月初调查有一百零五人已能完成任务，劳动和学习态度都有显著转变。其中有八十四人提出了在思想、技术、工作方面力争上游的保证书，三十六个人申请入团，三十五个人被评为优秀徒工。
    学、赶、超张兴云运动，已经在西安市工业生产中发挥了重要作用。据团市委对三十七个大工厂的统计，1月份前二十天，徒工们革新技术三万零一百多件，比1959年全年的革新件数还多一倍多。另据团市委青工部的不完全统计（不包括纺织系统），提前一周以上完成1月份计划的徒工有五万三千多名，全市全员劳动生产率较低的情况有显著转变。
