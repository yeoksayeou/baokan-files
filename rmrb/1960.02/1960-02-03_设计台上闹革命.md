Revolution on the Drawing Board

By our reporters Wang Dianxue and Bai Lincai

From Hand-Drawn Lines to Cut-and-Paste

Recently, we visited the Anshan Coking and Refractory Materials Design Institute. In the Refractory Materials Department, we saw designers pasting small pieces of ready-made paper onto the drawings they were working on. After some modifications and a few connecting lines, a construction drawing of a raw material nozzle was quickly designed. The person leading our tour explained that this method of designing nozzles was like a fuse, igniting a revolution in design methods.

We later learned that designing nozzles, which accounted for two-thirds of the effort in designing the main structure of a refractory materials plant, had long been the key to quickly designing such plants. After National Day last year, the department faced difficulties in completing its annual design tasks ahead of schedule due to a shortage of manpower for nozzle design. At that time, one design had to be completed by December 5th. The leader of the design team requested six additional people, otherwise it would be difficult to complete the task on time. His reasoning was sound: design work is manual labor, requiring each line to be drawn by hand, and one cannot do without a single line.

Jiang Hongqi, the deputy director of the department, also understood that unless the method of designing nozzles was reformed, the design task could not be completed. As he flipped through the drawings and looked at the nozzle designs, he couldn't help but ask himself: Why must we draw each line by hand? Can't we think of a better way? As he pondered, he suddenly thought: When designing equipment layout drawings, we often cut out the equipment diagrams and paste them onto the design drawings. Could we also use this method for designing nozzles? He thought: If we pre-print the most difficult parts to draw, such as "elbows" and "tees," and then cut them out and paste them when designing nozzles, wouldn't that greatly speed up the design process!

He discussed this with the team, and those who had suffered enough from the nozzle design process applauded the idea. They immediately put it into action. They spent two days designing more than a dozen sets of "elbows" and "tees" of different sizes. On the fourth day, the nozzle designers simultaneously began a nozzle design demonstration. When they reached the turning points of the nozzle, they took the "elbow" diagram and pasted it on; when they reached the branching points, they took the "tee" diagram and pasted it on. With a few additional lines to connect it to other parts, they were done. As a result, the fastest designer took only two hours, and the slowest took about four hours. The task that everyone thought was impossible to complete was completed twenty days ahead of schedule.

As soon as this experience emerged, the Party Committee attached great importance to it and promoted it throughout the institute's design departments. Subsequently, all the designers in the institute launched a mass movement of "rummaging through boxes and cabinets" and "everyone contributing ideas." In just over two months, they sorted out and created 599 sets of construction design drawings and 226 preliminary designs, such as the "elbows" and "tees" used for cutting and pasting. This fundamentally changed the past practice of drawing designs line by line and drawing by drawing. Whether designing a foundation, a workshop, or even a factory, they adopted the method of designing nozzles and created a set of experiences in designing with a complete set of components.

Concentrating Forces to Fight "Battles of Annihilation"

The revolution in design methods brought about high-speed design. In front of the three people in the coking group of the Coking Department responsible for reviewing drawings lay a thick stack of twenty sets of over one hundred and sixty draft drawings waiting to be reviewed. According to the plan, they had to be reviewed in just four days in order to be handed over to the construction unit on time. If they were reviewed according to the original method, it would take them at least a month to complete, no matter how fast they worked.

On the one hand, the reviewers were overwhelmed, and on the other hand, the original designers had nothing to do. At this time, Zhu Zhixue, the leader of the review team, thought: Wouldn't it be good to mobilize everyone in the group to review the drawings? As soon as he thought of this, he immediately discussed it with the other two reviewers. In design work, the drawing review process had always been regarded as a "forbidden zone." Ordinary designers could not do it; only experienced veterans could. During the discussion, Huang Dingqin, one of the original reviewers, expressed doubt, saying: I'm afraid it won't work. We sometimes make mistakes when we review. How can we guarantee quality if everyone in the group reviews the drawings? However, reviewer Zhang Baoping thought the idea was good, saying: If we don't do it this way, how can we complete the task? All three agreed to try it out first. If it didn't work, they would think of another way.

Zhu Zhixue worked through the night to create a plan for the entire group to review the drawings. With the original three people as the center, he formed three drawing review mutual aid groups and launched a drawing review performance competition. As soon as the performance competition started, the three people in Zhang Baoping's mutual aid group made specific divisions of labor in advance. Zhang Baoping reviewed the main parts, one person reviewed the minor parts, and another person reviewed the numbers. The three people worked in parallel and on an assembly line. The drawing review task that would have taken thirty days to complete was completed in just four days.

"One person working for ten days is never equal to ten people working for one day. Once the masses are mobilized, their potential is inexhaustible." Zhu Zhixue said meaningfully to us. Through personal experience, they all realized that concentrating forces to fight battles of annihilation can unleash everyone's wisdom, boost everyone's enthusiasm, and ten people working for one day is far more effective than one person working for ten days. Immediately afterwards, when designing a coking plant with an annual output of 150,000 to 300,000 tons of coke, they adopted this organizational method. First, they concentrated forces to attack the design, then concentrated forces to attack the drawing review, and finally concentrated forces to compile the material list and budget. The overall design efficiency was improved by more than two times.

Data "Charted"

In the Civil Engineering Department of this design institute, an interesting performance competition was once held. Two technicians sat on either side of the design table, simultaneously demonstrating how to calculate how much steel reinforcement was needed for a floor slab. One was the originator of the "Calculation Chart," and the other was the "fastest hand" in the entire department for calculating data. The entire department surrounded them, and dozens of eyes simultaneously watched their movements.

The originator of the "Calculation Chart" simply looked up a number from the curve of the "Calculation Chart," pulled the slide rule, converted it into another number, then looked up another curve, and converted it again with the slide rule. After repeating this several times, he calculated the required data in exactly eight minutes. However, the person who was always known as the "fastest hand" was far behind his opponent this time. He added, subtracted, multiplied, divided, and extracted square roots, calculated several pages of paper, used one formula after another, and took more than an hour to calculate it. One "Calculation Chart" helped to improve calculation efficiency by seven times.

In design work, data calculation is almost indispensable, and the amount of labor required is also the most. In particular, calculating complex data not only requires arithmetic and algebraic equations, but sometimes also requires trigonometry, geometry, and even calculus, and it takes one or two days to calculate one piece of data. After it is calculated, it is not known whether it is correct, and it must be reviewed by another person. Now in this design institute, the calculation of various data is almost all "charted" or "slide-rule-ized." Someone composed a quick-rhyme poem when comparing the dramatically different situations before and after: Old Wang used to calculate frameworks (that is, calculations in design), his white jacket soaked with sweat; He sought a "y" for three days and three nights, and still made mistakes in the end, Little Wang calculates frameworks today, conveniently looks up the chart with his hand; No need for three days and three nights, he calculates it in an instant!

Rapid, High-Quality, Comprehensive Great Leap Forward

The entire staff of this design institute heard that the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry was going to hold a national on-site technical performance competition for design departments at their institute. To this end, they specifically held a joint technical performance competition using a complete set of methods to fight a design battle of annihilation. Starting from the second day of the conference, the performance consisted of doing the preliminary design of two coking plants. By the closing day of the conference, exactly four days later, the preliminary design of the two coking plants was completed.

Seeing this, some may ask: Fast is fast, but what about the quality? Let's look at the facts! Recently, this design institute received two pieces of good news one after another. One was that the Luyang Iron and Steel Plant's coking workshop used the new "coal drying" technology researched and developed by this design institute in the coke oven production designed by this design institute, and the daily coke production increased by eight times compared to the design level; the other was that the Qingdao Coking Plant took it to the next level, and the daily coke production increased by eleven times compared to the design level. This design institute has modified the original design and suggested that factories with this type of coke oven adopt this method. According to the most conservative increase in production, it can increase the annual output of 2 million tons of coke, which is equivalent to building 14 large-scale 42-hole coke ovens.

After the great leap forward in design, they extracted more than 60 people and established a research office, which is conducting research on 14 new technologies in coke and refractory material production. "Coal drying" is one of the research projects. At the same time, last year they sent more than 250 people to go deep into coke plants and refractory material plants across the country to investigate and research, collect new achievements in production technology, and continuously improve the design quality of coke and refractory material plants through both means.

    设计台上闹革命
    本报记者　王殿学　白林材
    从手描笔画到剪剪贴贴
    最近，我们访问了鞍山焦化耐火材料设计院。在耐火材料科里，看到设计人员，把小块小块现成的纸片，往正在设计的图纸上一贴，然后再修改修改画几笔，和别的部位连接成整体，一张原料漏嘴的施工图很快就设计好了。领着我们参观的人介绍说：这样设计漏嘴，像是一根导火线，引起了一场设计方法的大革命。
    我们后来听说，设计一个耐火材料厂的主体，要有三分之二的力量用在设计漏嘴上，早就成为能否快速设计耐火材料厂的关键了。去年国庆节以后，这个科在安排提前完成全年设计任务时，因为设计漏嘴的人力不足而感到困难。当时有一项设计，必须在12月5日完成。负责这项设计的小组长，要求给增加六个人，否则就难以按时完成任务。他说的也满有道理：设计这个活，是手工劳动，得一笔一笔、一条线一条线的画，少一笔或一条线也不行。
    副科长姜鸿起心里也明白，除非改革漏嘴的设计方法，不然设计任务是无法完成的。他翻阅着一张张图纸，望着一组组漏嘴设计，不由得自己问自己：为什么必须一笔笔的画，就想不出更好的办法来么？想呀想呀，他突然想到：在设计设备布置图时，常常把设备的图样剪下来，贴在设计图纸上；设计漏嘴可否也采用这种办法呢？他想：如果事先把最难画的“弯头”、“三通”等晒好图，等到设计漏嘴时，把图剪下来一贴，不是可以大大加快设计进度么！
    他和这个组的人一商量，已经受够漏嘴折磨的人，都拍手说这个办法好。真是说干就干，他们花两天的工夫，设计好了十几套不同尺寸的“弯头”和“三通”。第四天，设计漏嘴的人，同时展开设计漏嘴表演，画到漏嘴拐弯的地方，把“弯头”图形拿过来一贴，设计到漏嘴分岔的地方，又把“三通”图形拿过来一贴，只要再补充画几笔，和别的部分连接起来就行了。表演的结果，最快的只用了两个多小时，最慢的也只用了四小时左右。这一下，本来大家认为没办法完成的任务，反而提前二十天完成了。
    这个经验一出现，党委就十分重视，并在全院各设计科普遍推广。接着全院设计人员，展开了一场“翻箱倒柜”、“人人献计”的群众运动。两个多月工夫，就整理和创造出像剪贴用的“弯头”、“三通”那样的施工设计图五百九十九套、初步设计二百二十六套，从而根本改变了过去做设计必须一条线一条线画、一张图一张图设计的办法。不论是设计一个基础，还是设计一个车间，甚至设计一个工厂，都采用了设计漏嘴的办法，创造了一套用配套办法做设计的经验。
    集中兵力打“歼灭战”
    设计方法的大革命，带来设计的高速度。焦化科炼焦组三个负责审图人的面前，堆放着厚厚二十套一百六十多张草图在等着审核。按计划要求必须在短短四天里审完，才能按期交给施工单位。如果按照原来的办法审核，他们三个人干的再快，最少也得一个月才能审完。
    一方面是审核人忙不过来，一方面原来做设计的人又没活干。这时审核组组长朱志学就想：不好发动全组人都来审核么？他想到这里，马上就和另外两个审核人商量。审图这一环，在设计工作中，过去一直被视为“禁区”，一般的设计人员不能干，得有经验的老手才行。在商量的时候，原有的审图人员黄鼎钦表示怀疑说：怕不成吧，咱们审的时候，有时还出漏洞呢，要是全组人都来审图的话，那怎么保证质量呢？审图员张保平却认为这个办法好，他说：不这样办的话，咱们可怎么能完成任务呢？三个人都同意先试一试，不行的话再另想办法。
    朱志学连夜突击，做出全组人审图的方案，以原来的三个人为中心，成立三个审图互助组，开展审图表演赛。表演赛一开始，张保平互助组三个人，事先做好了具体分工，张保平审核主要部分、一个人审核次要部分，另一个人审数字：三个人平行流水作业，需要三十天才能完成的审图任务，这次只用了四天就干完了。
    “一个人干十天，绝不等于十个人干一天，群众发动起来了，潜力就是挖不完”。朱志学意味深长地对我们说。他们通过亲身的体会，都认识到集中兵力打歼灭战，可以发挥大家的智慧，鼓足每个人的干劲，十个人干一天，比一个人干十天的效果大得多。紧接着，他们在设计一个年产十五万吨到三十万吨焦炭的焦化厂时，就采用了这个组织方法。先集中兵力突击设计，再集中兵力突击审图，最后集中兵力编制材料表和预算，整个设计提高效率两倍多。
    数据“图表化”
    在这个设计院的土建科里，曾经举行过一次有趣的表演赛。两个技术员坐在设计桌两边，同时表演计算一块楼板里需要布置多少钢筋。一个是“计算图表”的首创者，一个是全科计算数据的“快手”。全科人把他俩围得风雨不透，几十双眼睛同时注视着他们的动作。
    只见“计算图表”首创者，从“计算图表”的曲线上，查到一个数字，拉拉计算尺，换算成另外一个数字，再查另外一条曲线，再拉计算尺换算。如此反复几次，前后刚好八分钟，就把需要的数据算出来了。可是一向被称为“快手”的人，这回却落在对手的后面老远。他，加、减、乘、除、开方，算了好几页纸，公式一个接一个，用了一个多钟头，才算出来。一份“计算图表”，却帮助提高计算效率七倍。
    在设计工作中，几乎离不开数据计算，而且花费的劳动量也最多。特别是计算复杂的数据，不仅要用算术、代数方程式，有时还要用三角、几何甚至微积分，算一个数据要一两天。算出来了，还不知道对不对，要由另外一个人审核。现在这个设计院里，各种数据的计算，差不多都“图表化”、或“土计算尺化”了。有人在对比前后截然不同的局面时编了一首快板诗：老王过去算框架（就是设计中的计算），汗水湿透白小褂；三天三夜求个“y”，算来算去还出差，小王今天算框架，顺手只把图表查；不用三天和三夜，转瞬之间算好啦！
    快速优质全面跃进
    这个设计院的全体职工，听说冶金工业部要在他们这里召开全国设计部门技术表演赛现场会议，为此，他们特意举行了一次运用配套办法、大打设计歼灭战的联合技术表演赛。从会议第二天开始，表演做两座焦化厂的初步设计，到会议闭幕这天止整整四天，两座焦化厂的初步设计就做完了。
    看到这里，也许有人要问：快倒是快，可是质量如何？那咱们就看看事实吧！最近，这个设计院先后接到两份喜报。一份是洛阳钢铁厂炼焦车间把这个设计院研究成功的“煤干燥”的新技术，用在这个设计院设计的焦炉生产上去，焦炭的日产量比设计水平提高了八倍；一份是青岛焦化厂更上一层楼，焦炭日产量比设计水平提高了十一倍。这个设计院已经修改了原设计，建议有这种炼焦炉的工厂都采用这个办法，按照最保守的增产幅度计算，每年可以增产二百万吨焦炭，等于新建十四座四十二孔的大型焦炉。
    在设计大跃进之后，他们抽出六十多人，成立了一个研究室，正在进行十四项焦化、耐火材料生产新技术的研究，“煤干燥”就是研究项目之一。同时在去年派出二百五十多人，深入到全国各地焦化厂、耐火材料厂去调查研究，搜集生产技术上的新成就，双管齐下不断地提高焦化、耐火材料工厂的设计质量。
