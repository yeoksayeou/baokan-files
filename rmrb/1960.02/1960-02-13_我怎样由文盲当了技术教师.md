    How I Went From Illiterate to Technical Teacher
    Wei Caisheng, Teacher at the Hongzhuan School in Nanli Village, Houma, Shanxi

    When I was little, due to the cruel oppression of the Japanese invaders and the Yan bandits, my family couldn’t even get enough to eat, let alone afford schooling. After liberation, under the education of the Party, it became clear to me that to take the socialist road, build a new countryside, and live a happier life, we must learn to read and write. So, I was the first to sign up for winter school. Through the rapid literacy campaign of 1952, I shed my illiteracy in 1953. After consolidation and review, I entered the amateur higher primary school class in 1954.

    When the agricultural cooperative was established in 1954, I was elected as a technician. At that time, due to my low level of education, I encountered many difficulties in my work. I couldn't understand the terms and jargon in the technical pamphlets, and I didn't know how to calculate the row and plant spacing for close planting or the amount of fertilizer to apply. Once, I went to the township for a cotton planting meeting, and because I couldn't take good notes, I didn't convey the information clearly when I returned, forcing the cooperative leader to ask again. The work forced me to study hard. Therefore, in addition to persisting in studying in the higher primary school class, I also bought "Arithmetic Games," subscribed to the Farmer's Daily, and carried a small dictionary and notebook with me, seizing all spare time to study diligently. I also learned from elementary school teachers and volunteer teachers, consulted with middle school students who returned to the village on Sundays, and volunteered to help cadres copy plans and reports. Through various aspects of learning and practical training, my reading, writing, and arithmetic skills continuously improved, and I graduated from the amateur higher primary school class in 1957.

    After the General Line of Socialist Construction was announced, a great leap forward in production was also launched in our village. During the Great Leap Forward in production, a serious problem was the lack of fertilizer. At this time, the Party branch called for self-reliance in making indigenous fertilizer. Under the leadership of the Party, I worked with several workers who had boiled saltpeter to study and put forward suggestions to set up a fertilizer factory. The Party branch asked me to be the director of the factory.

    At the beginning, we tried to make lime urea and nitrogen-fixing bacterial fertilizer based on materials published in the newspapers. Due to improper control of the feeding time and temperature, the results were unsuccessful. The nitrogen-fixing bacteria became moldy, and the nitrogen content of the lime urea was only 0.4%. At this time, some people said I was wasting work points, some cadres suggested that if I didn't understand technology, I shouldn't run the fertilizer factory at all, and my family also complained. I was anxious and angry and wanted to give up. At this time, the branch secretary encouraged me, saying: Don't be afraid of failure, study more, and discuss with the masses more, and we will definitely succeed. The volunteer teacher also criticized me for not giving up halfway and helped me find the reasons for the failure. With the help of the Party branch and the teacher, I mustered my courage again and simply moved to the fertilizer factory and lived with the workers, working day and night. After three more experiments, we finally succeeded. After testing, it was fully qualified.

    Through this experience and lesson, I deeply realized that staying at the level of "learning as you do" cannot meet the needs of work, and we should systematically study complete scientific knowledge with a plan. So I bought twenty-four technical pamphlets, such as Fertilizer Handbook and Indigenous Fertilizer Journal, and studied them chapter by chapter. When I couldn't figure something out in the village, I went to the city to seek teachers and visit friends. I went to the fertilizer company more than forty times, ran to the fertilizer factory nine times, went to the agricultural school seven times, and went to the first middle school five times, and everywhere I received enthusiastic help and specific guidance. In this way, I quickly learned twenty technical books, improved my scientific and technical knowledge, and learned to use rapid testing kits to test the nutrients and specific gravity of various soils and fertilizers. I continued to manufacture "Indigenous Nitrogen and Phosphorus Fertilizer," "Saltpeter Bacterial Fertilizer," and "Artificial Urea," and produced them in large quantities in the fertilizer factory.

    After producing a large amount of fertilizer, a big problem occurred: many people did not believe that indigenous fertilizer was effective. Originally, each team was short of fertilizer, but they were unwilling to take the indigenous fertilizer. Some who received it did not use it according to regulations, but scattered it casually on the ground, and the fertilizer effect was lost due to wind and sun exposure. After discussing with the volunteer teacher, I compiled two teaching materials, "The Three Elements of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium" and "Nitrogen-Fixing Bacteria Agent." In addition to explaining the principles, I also used a rapid testing kit to test them in class and conducted comparative experiments in the radish field. The facts convinced the people that they believed in the role of indigenous fertilizer.

    The Party branch summarized this experience of educating the masses and added a soil and fertilizer class to the Hongzhuan School, hiring me as a technical teacher. The Science Association also helped us establish a fertilizer group and elected me as the leader. As for teaching, I didn't know anything about it. I remember, the first time I talked about bacterial fertilizer, I couldn't even say what bacteria were when students asked me. Later, with the help of the Party branch secretary, a research group was established in the soil and fertilizer class, consisting of five advanced workers. The volunteer teacher and I served as the group leader and deputy group leader, respectively. The deputy group leader helped me find reference materials, summarize experience, compile teaching materials, and provide opinions on teaching and grading homework. The workers inspected the fertilizer effect and solicited opinions from various teams. Based on these situations, I conducted technical research with the comrades in the group and prepared for teaching. With this organization, I felt like I had wings, and I had confidence in what I did. For example, when wheat was flowering this year, lodging occurred. After the organization discussed it, it was believed that quick-acting potassium fertilizer was needed. I found reference materials, and the workers provided local experience. After three experiments, crystalline potassium nitrate was made, which effectively prevented wheat lodging in a timely manner. Based on the experimental results, I compiled teaching materials and explained them to the students three times, imparting technical knowledge.

    After this organization was established, I could also take some time to study teaching work, overcoming the past bias of blindly teaching whatever was available. There were also improvements in teaching methods. Before lecturing, I first democratically prepared lessons in the research group, focusing on trial lectures, finding difficulties, and preparing teaching aids. The five-character teaching method of "lecture, question, debate, test, and summary" was adopted during the lecture, that is, asking questions while lecturing in the classroom, inspiring students to think independently, and arousing interest in learning. Further organize discussions on major issues. On the basis of a basic understanding of the ideas, conduct laboratory and field experiments. Finally, summarize and test. In addition to requiring students to express their opinions on the questions in class and study the teaching materials well, they are also organized into groups according to production to conduct research and independent observation in combination with production practice, thereby improving the teaching effect. At the same time, the knowledge learned by the students is gradually applied to practice, greatly improving the enthusiasm of the students to study technology. For example, at the teaching seminar, everyone unanimously proposed to create crystalline "ammonium sulfate" to solve the urgent need for topdressing in water and remote areas. With everyone's efforts, crystalline "ammonium sulfate" was finally extracted from human urine, containing 18% nitrogen, and one and a half jin could top one jin of commercial "ammonium sulfate." Compared with applying indigenous fertilizer, each mu can save seventeen labor and improve work efficiency five times, and the raw materials are sufficient and can be produced in large quantities.

    In the past year, under the direct leadership of the Party branch and the enthusiastic help of volunteer teachers and workers, a total of nineteen kinds of indigenous and foreign fertilizers have been successfully trial-produced, totaling 4.05 million jin, which basically guaranteed the urgent need for fertilizer for autumn fields in 1958 and base fertilizer for cotton fields and topdressing for autumn fields in 1959, saving an investment of 60,000 yuan. The thirty students in the fertilizer class also understood the effects of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium on plants and their adaptability to the soil. I myself have also read more than a hundred ordinary fertilizer production books and technical books, can test and identify the nutrients and specific gravity of soil fertilizers, and can use the principle of bacterial culture to make various bacterial fertilizers. I can manufacture crystalline fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, and magnesium chloride. The masses also compiled a quick board for me:

    Wei Caisheng is not simple, making indigenous fertilizer better than ammonium sulfate; lecturing better than foreign professors, new-type farmers rely on Hongzhuan.

    The above achievements were obtained under the specific leadership of the Party and the strong support of the masses, and they still fall far short of meeting the needs of the Party and the country. In the future, I will continue to exert my efforts and strive to reach the junior high school graduation level this year, and at the same time complete high school chemistry and reach the intermediate technical level within three years. I will also enable young and middle-aged students to complete the first volume of technical teaching materials, so that students will further learn soil analysis and pesticide manufacturing, continue to study new varieties of fertilizers, and strive to accelerate agricultural modernization.

    我怎样由文盲当了技术教师
    山西侯马南李村红专学校教师　卫才盛
    我小的时候，由于日寇和阎匪的残酷压迫，一家人连饭都吃不饱，更谈不到念书了。解放后，在党的教育下，明确了我们要走社会主义道路，建设新农村，过更幸福的生活，必须识字学文化。所以我第一个报名参加了冬学学习。通过1952年的速成识字运动，1953年甩掉了文盲帽子；经过巩固复习，到1954年升入业余高小班学习。
    1954年成立农业社时，我被选为技术员。当时因文化低，工作中遇到很多困难，看不懂技术小册子中的名词术语，不会计算密植的行距株距和施肥量。有一次到乡里开棉花下种会，因记不好笔记，回来后没传达清楚，害的社长又去问了一次。工作逼着我非好好学习不行。因此除坚持高小班学习外，还买了“算术游戏”，订了农民报，身上装着小字典和笔记本，抓紧一切业余时间刻苦自学。并向小学教师、义务教师学习，星期日向回村的中学生请教，还主动帮助干部抄写计划报告等。经过多方面的学习和实际锻炼，使我的读、写、算能力不断提高，1957年又在业余高小班毕业了。
    社会主义建设总路线公布以后，我村也掀起了生产大跃进。在生产大跃进中，严重的问题是没有肥料。这时党支部号召自造土化肥。在党的领导下，我跟几个熬过硝的工人研究，提出了建议，办起了肥料厂。党支部叫我当了厂长。
    开始，我们根据报上刊登的材料，试制石灰尿素和固氮菌肥。由于下料时间和温度掌握的不适当，结果失败了。固氮菌发霉，石灰尿素管氮量只有0．4％。这时有些群众说我混工分，部分干部也主张不懂技术就干脆别办肥料厂，家里也埋怨起来。我又急又气，想打退堂鼓。这时支部书记鼓励我说：不要怕失败，多学习，多和群众研究，一定能成功。义务教师也批评我不该半途而废，并帮我找失败原因。在党支部和老师的帮助下，我又鼓起了勇气，索性搬到肥料厂和工人们住在一起，白天干，晚上也干。又经过三次试验，终于成功了。经化验，完全合格。
    通过这次经验教训，我深刻体会到停留在“作啥学啥”的水平上，是不能满足工作需要的，应当有计划有系统地学习完整的科学知识。于是我便买了肥料手册、土化肥志等二十四本技术小册子，逐章学起。在村里研究不通的，就进城求师访友。我曾先后进化肥公司四十余次，并九奔肥料厂、七赴农校、五到一中，处处都得到了热情的帮助和具体指导。这样，我很快学完了二十本技术书籍，提高了科学技术知识，学会了使用速测箱化验各种土壤肥料的养分和比重。继续制造出“土制氮磷肥”、“硝菌肥”、“人造尿”，并在肥料厂大量生产起来。
    在制出大量肥料后，发生了一个很大的问题：很多群众不相信土化肥有效，本来每队都很缺肥料，但不愿要土化肥；有的领了也不按规定使用，随便撒在地上，风吹日晒失去肥效。经我和义务教师研究，编写了“氮磷钾三要素”和“固氮菌剂”两课教材，除讲道理外，还当堂用速测箱化验，并在萝卜地作了对比试验。事实说服了群众，他们相信了土化肥的作用。
    党支部总结了这个教育群众的经验，在红专学校加设了土壤肥料班，聘请我当技术教师；科协又帮助我们建立了化肥小组，选我当组长。对教学来说，我是一门不摸。记得，第一次讲细菌肥料时，学员问我什么是细菌，我都说不来。后来，经党支书帮助，在土壤肥料班建立了一个研究组，由五个先进工人组成，我和义务教师分任正副组长，副组长帮我找参考资料，总结经验，编写教材，提出教课批改作业意见；工人检查肥效，征求各队意见。我根据这些情况和组里同志进行技术研究，准备教学工作。有了这个组织，我真像长了翅膀一样，干起来就有了把握。如今年小麦扬花时发生了倒伏现象，经组织大家研究，认为需施速效性钾肥。我找参考资料，工人提供土经验，经三次试验，制成了结晶体硝酸钾，适时地有效地防止了小麦倒伏。根据试验结果编出教材，并向学员讲解了三次，传授了技术知识。
    这个组织建立以后，也能抽出一定时间研究教学工作，克服了过去盲目的抓住什么教什么的偏向。教学方法上也有了改进。我在讲课前，先在研究组民主备课，重点试讲，找出难点，备好教具。讲课时采取“讲、提、辩、试、总”的五字教学法，即在课堂上边讲边提问题，边启发学员独立思考，引起学习兴趣；进一步针对主要问题组织讨论；在思想基本明确的基础上，进行化验和田间试验；最后总结考试。对学员除要求在课堂上针对问题各申己见、学好教材外，并按生产组织编成小组，结合生产实践进行研究和独立观察，从而提高教学效果。同时使学员学得的知识逐步用于实际，大大提高了学员钻研技术的积极性。如在教学座谈会上，大家一致提出创制结晶体“硫铵”，解决水地、远地追肥的急需。在大家努力下，终于从人尿中提炼出结晶体“硫铵”，含氮18％，一斤半可顶一斤商品“硫铵”，与施土肥相比，每亩可节约劳力十七个，提高工效五倍，而且原料充足，能大量制造。
    一年来在党支部直接领导和义务教师、工人的热情帮助下，先后试制成功十九种土、洋化肥，共四百零五万斤，基本上保证了1958年秋田用肥和1959年棉田底肥、秋田追肥的急需，节约投资六万元。肥料班的三十名学员，也懂得了氮磷钾对植物的作用和对土壤的适应性。我自己也读了普通制肥书和技术书籍百余本，能化验、鉴定土壤肥料的养分和比重，能用菌殖菌的道理制各种细菌肥料。能制造硫铵硝铵、氯化镁等化合物结晶体肥料，群众还给我编了个快板：
    卫才盛不简单，自造化肥赛硫铵；讲课赛过洋教授，新型农民凭红专。
    上边这些成绩，是在党的具体领导和群众的大力支持下获得的，还远远满足不了党和国家的需要。今后我要继续鼓足干劲，争取在今年达到初中毕业水平，同时学完高中化学，三年内达到中级技术水平；并要使青壮年学员学完第一册技术教材，使学员进一步学会土壤分析和农药制造，继续研究肥料新品种，为加速农业现代化而努力。
