    The First Step of a Boundless Journey
    Liu Qian
    "Northern Jiangsu is determined to catch up with Southern Jiangsu, and Southern Jiangsu strives for even higher yields." This is the slogan proposed by the people of Jiangsu Province in the Great Leap Forward of last year and this year. Encouraged by this slogan, the rural areas of Jiangsu Province are in the midst of a magnificent upsurge of spring plowing and preparation, with everyone chasing and surpassing each other.
    The Yancheng Special District has proposed "leaping out of Yancheng to catch up with Southern Jiangsu," and the people of the Xuhuai Plain have also made a great determination to "cross the Huai River to catch up with Southern Jiangsu." They firmly believe that "the poor in spirit are not poor in ambition, the land may be bad, but the people are not, with the Party's leadership, everything can be done well." Since the proposal of the General Line and the establishment of the people's communes, the people's minds have been greatly liberated, establishing ambitious goals, taking a broad and long-term view, radiating vision, and possessing a hundredfold of courage and full of confidence, daring to think of things never thought of before, and daring to do things never done before. In some areas of Northern Jiangsu, large areas of dry land have been converted into paddy fields and planted with rice. Even those who used to say "our mouths are destined to eat sweet potatoes, how can we eat rice" are now eating rice grown by their own hands. Some young agricultural technicians from Southern Jiangsu who came to impart their experience have fallen in love with this place in Northern Jiangsu and settled down here. From this, it can be seen that Northern and Southern Jiangsu are only separated by a river, and there is no insurmountable boundary.
    Northern Jiangsu's determination to catch up with Southern Jiangsu is indeed a remarkable ambition, however, it is only the first step of a boundless journey. They will never be satisfied with reaching the level of Southern Jiangsu, they will not only catch up with Southern Jiangsu, but also surpass it. But will Southern Jiangsu stop and let them catch up? No, definitely not, Southern Jiangsu is also striving for higher yields.
    Taking the Suzhou Special District, known as "paradise," as an example, it is not satisfied with its existing achievements. Now China is full of paradises, and they know that there is a heaven beyond the heavens, and better beyond the good. They do not think that the production level of high-yield areas is already quite high and can no longer leap forward; nor do they think that high-yield areas have a large base and cannot increase production significantly, but rather believe that high-yield areas can continue to achieve high yields and even higher yields, and they have already done so last year. Their current slogan is: "Wheat must catch up with rice, and rice must double again." Last year, the Suzhou Special District achieved an all-round bumper harvest in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations and fisheries, with a total output value of agricultural and sideline products increasing by 32.3% compared with 1958, and a total grain output increasing by 25.3% compared with 1958. This proves with facts that areas that have always had high yields can completely continue to leap forward. The reason for this is that they have the ambition of communists, have lofty goals, carry forward the spirit of continuous leap forward, create a situation of leap forward after leap forward, and use the fastest speed and greatest effort to develop production. With ambition, unfavorable conditions can be turned into favorable conditions; without conditions, conditions can also be created, and miracles can be created. Those who originally had the conditions, if they establish ambition, will create more favorable conditions on the original basis and strive for continuous leap forward.
    Under the three bright red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and under the great call to promote "breaking superstitions, liberating thought, and carrying forward the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do," the people have established the proletarian ambition to transform nature, and regard things that they never dared to think of before as the goals of their current struggle. Such goals are in line with the urgent desires of the people and the laws of development of things, and are a concentrated expression of revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism. As long as efforts are made, they are entirely possible to achieve. It is precisely because of this ambition and great goals that revolutionary enthusiasm arises, and all skills are used to exert invincible and unconquerable great power.
    There is no limit to ambition, the journey is boundless, and the future is limitless. Our conscious dynamism is being developed more and more fully, our achievements are getting bigger and bigger, and our cause is getting wider and wider. "Northern Jiangsu is determined to catch up with Southern Jiangsu, and Southern Jiangsu strives for even higher yields" are only the first steps, but these are valuable first steps. Only those who foresee the future can take such steps.

    万里鹏程第一步
    刘浅
    “苏北立志赶江南，江南力争更高产。”这是江苏人民在去年和今年的大跃进里提出的口号。在这个口号鼓舞下，江苏省农村正处在一个气势壮阔你追我赶的备耕和春耕高潮里。
    盐城专区提出“跳出盐城赶江南”，徐淮平原人民也立下大志，“跨过淮河赶江南”。他们坚决相信，“人穷志不穷，地孬人不孬，有党来领导，万事能办好。”自从总路线提出和人民公社化之后，人民思想大大解放，树立了雄心大志，高瞻远瞩，目光四射，勇气百倍，信心十足，敢于想到以前所从未曾想到的事，敢于做从来未曾做过的事。苏北一些地区，大面积旱地改成了水田，种上了水稻，即使那些过去曾经说“嘴是吃山芋的命，哪里能吃大米”的人，现在也吃到自己亲手种的大米了。苏南来传授经验的青年农业技术员，有些人已爱上了苏北这块地方，在苏北安家落户。由此可见，江北和江南仅仅一水之隔，并没有什么永远不能逾越的界线。
    苏北立志赶江南，这的确是了不起的雄心大志，然而，这又不过是万里鹏程的第一步而已。他们决不以达到江南的水平为满足，他们不仅要赶上江南，还要超过江南。可是江南就停止不前，让人赶上去吗？不，决不，江南也在力争更高产。
    以有“天堂”之称的苏州专区来说，也并没有满足既有的成就。现在的中国到处是天堂，他们知道天外有天，好以上还有更好。他们并不认为高产区生产水平已经相当高了，再也不能跃进：他们也没有认为高产地区基数大，就不可能再大幅度增产，而是认为高产地区也能不断地高产再高产，并且去年他们已经做到了。他们现在的口号是：“三麦再赶水稻，水稻再翻一番。”去年苏州专区农林牧副渔全面大丰收，农副业总产值比1958年增长32．3％，粮食总产量比1958年增长25．3％。这就用事实证明一向高产的地区完全能够持续跃进。其所以如此，就是由于他们有共产主义者的雄心大志，有远大的奋斗目标，发扬持续跃进的干劲，创造跃进再跃进的局面，用最快的速度，最大的努力来发展生产。有雄心壮志，不利条件可以变为有利条件；没有条件，也可创造出条件，创造出奇迹来。原来就有条件的树立了雄心大志，就会在原有的基础上，创造出更有利的条件，争取连续跃进。
    在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面鲜明的红旗之下，在发扬“破除迷信、解放思想、发扬敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格”的伟大号召之下，人民树立了无产阶级改造自然的雄心大志，把从前连想也不敢想的事，作为现在奋斗的目标。这样的奋斗目标，是符合人民群众的迫切愿望和事物的发展规律的，是革命英雄主义和革命乐观主义的集中表现。只要经过努力，是完全可能实现的。也正是因为有了这种雄心大志和伟大的奋斗目标，于是就产生了革命的干劲，就拿出全副本领，使出全身解数，发挥无坚不摧、无攻不克的伟大力量。
    雄心壮志是没有止境的，鹏程万里，前途无量。我们的自觉的能动性也越来越充分地发扬，我们的成绩也越来越大，我们的事业也越来越广阔。“苏北立志赶江南，江南力争更高产”，都不过是第一步，然而这是可贵的第一步，这可贵的第一步，只有预见到未来的人，才能举起这样的脚步。
