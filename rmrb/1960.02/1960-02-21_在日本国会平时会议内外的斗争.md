    Struggle Inside and Outside the Japanese Diet's Ordinary Session
    Lan Hai
    The 34th Ordinary Session of the Japanese Diet, which convened on December 29th of last year, resumed on January 30th after the New Year's holiday. This session will last until May 26th, for a total of approximately 150 days. On January 19th, during the Diet's recess, the Japanese "plenipotentiary delegation" headed by Nobusuke Kishi went to Washington to sign the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Regardless of the condemnation and protests from the peace-loving people of Japan and the world, the Kishi Nobusuke government signed a military alliance treaty with the United States that openly antagonizes China, the Soviet Union, and the people of Asia. The discussion of this new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" will be a most important item on the agenda of the 34th Ordinary Session of the Diet, thus making this ordinary session an important Diet session.
    On February 1st, Nobusuke Kishi delivered a policy speech at the plenary sessions of both the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors. Although Kishi admitted in his speech that the international situation was developing in the direction of relaxation and peaceful coexistence, he stated that, "this situation has arisen because the East and West rely on a collective security guarantee system to maintain a balance of military power." Kishi flaunted the "policy of strength" of the Dulles clique, which emphasizes the so-called "free countries still need to maintain their firm determination, unity, and strength," and sophistically argued that the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is a "treaty for peace and freedom." Despite the Japanese people's desire to normalize Japan-China relations, Kishi did not mention opening up Japan-China relations in his policy speech. This exposes that the Kishi cabinet's China policy completely follows the lead of U.S. imperialism.
    Currently, the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party are doing everything possible to force the Diet to pass the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." However, judging from the situation within the Liberal Democratic Party, things will not go as smoothly as Kishi and the "mainstream faction" imagine. Leading figures from various factions within the Liberal Democratic Party are engaged in frequent and complex activities. The "anti-mainstream faction" wants to use the Diet's deliberation of the new "Security Treaty" to shake the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and replace it. Last September and November, former Prime Minister Tanzan Ishibashi and Liberal Democratic Party advisor Kenzo Matsumura visited China one after another. Their visits to China also reflect the contradictions and wavering within the Liberal Democratic Party in the face of the widespread popular demand for the normalization of Japan-China relations and the easing of international tensions.
    The democratic forces, led by the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party, are actively fighting to prevent the Diet from ratifying this treaty. On February 2nd, Socialist Party Chairman Mosaburo Suzuki questioned the government's policy speech at the House of Representatives meeting. He condemned the treaty for running counter to the trend of easing international tensions and demanded the dissolution of the House of Representatives before deliberating the new "Security Treaty." Suzuki pointed out that the new "Security Treaty" is hostile to China, thereby creating difficulties for the normalization of Japan-China relations demanded by the Japanese people.
    Chairman of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, Sanzo Nosaka, delivered an interpellation speech at the House of Councillors meeting on February 4th. Nosaka sharply exposed and condemned the new "Security Treaty" as an aggressive military alliance that violates the United Nations Charter and is hostile to China and the Soviet Union. He solemnly declared: "At the beginning of this 1960, two important treaties were signed in Asia. One is the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression based on the principles of peaceful coexistence, and the other is the aggressive Japan-U.S. military treaty based on the 'policy of strength.'" He also emphasized that the direction of Japan's development should be friendship and non-aggression with the Soviet Union and China, rather than concluding an aggressive military alliance with U.S. imperialism.
    Currently, the Socialist Party is still the largest opposition party in the Japanese Diet. However, since the split by the extreme right-wing democratic socialist elements led by Suehiro Nishio in September of last year, a split has occurred within the Socialist Party. When the 33rd Extraordinary Session of the Diet deliberated the war reparations agreement signed by the Kishi Nobusuke government with South Vietnam last year, although the Socialist Party repeatedly forced the Kishi Nobusuke government into an embarrassing situation, it ultimately failed to deal a decisive blow to the Kishi Nobusuke government due to the divisive activities of the democratic socialist elements.
    Today, what the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the ruling faction of the Liberal Democratic Party fear most is that when the Diet deliberates the new "Security Treaty," there will be a situation where the opposition party refuses to deliberate, resulting in the Liberal Democratic Party deliberating alone. If such an important treaty involving the fate of the country is approved only by the Liberal Democratic Party's sole deliberation, it will inevitably arouse public outrage. Moreover, the "anti-mainstream faction" within the Liberal Democratic Party will use this to blame the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet for its failure, thus risking further sharpening the internal party struggle.
    The Democratic Socialist Party, established on January 24th of this year, can be said to have given the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the ruling faction of the Liberal Democratic Party a tranquilizer. The Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's wishful thinking is that the Democratic Socialist Party will not agree with the Socialist Party's refusal to deliberate the new "Security Treaty" in the Diet, so that the Liberal Democratic Party can get rid of the isolated situation of deliberating alone. In fact, the Democratic Socialist Party flaunts "parliamentarianism" and plays the role of the Liberal Democratic Party's "detached force." On February 2nd, Chozo Mizutani, the leader of the Democratic Socialist Party's Diet members group, delivered a questioning speech on behalf of the Democratic Socialist Party in the House of Representatives. Chozo Mizutani put forward the so-called "phased abolition theory" of the "Security Treaty." According to his explanation, the so-called "phased abolition theory" is to change the U.S. military from peacetime stationing to emergency stationing, and the purpose of the U.S. military's stationing in Japan is limited to "defending Japan." This is actually just adding some deceptive colors to the "Security Treaty," and its purpose is nothing more than to split the united action of the Japanese people who are trying to prevent the ratification and strive for the abolition of the "Security Treaty."
    At present, the Liberal Democratic Party occupies an absolute majority of seats in both the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors of the Diet. It is attempting to rely on this "majority" and the assistance of the Democratic Socialist Party to force the Diet to ratify the new "Security Treaty." However, outside the Diet, there is a real majority that firmly opposes the ratification of the new "Security Treaty." Currently, one thousand joint struggle organizations against the revision of the "Security Treaty" have been established throughout Japan. During the struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Law" the year before last, there were only two hundred joint struggle organizations. This shows the rapid development of the Japanese people's struggle for peace, independence, and democracy. The joint struggle organizations against the revision of the "Security Treaty," with the unified action of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and "Sohyo" as the center, are preparing to hold the 12th National Unified Action on February 25th this year, following the national unified action at the end of last year.
    The Japanese Communist Party, which has always stood at the forefront of the Japanese people's struggle, is doing everything in its power to actively develop the struggle against the "Security Treaty" carried out by these joint struggle organizations in the direction of a national democratic united front. It is worth noting that in the people's struggle against the "Security Treaty," some masses influenced by the Democratic Socialist Party have also actively participated in the unified action. If the democratic forces within the Diet successfully combine closely with this unified action outside the Diet, coupled with the intensification of the factional struggle of the Liberal Democratic Party, the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet will fall into a dead end and may even dissolve the Diet or implement a general cabinet resignation. Whether the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet can be forced into this situation will depend on the powerful development of the unified action of the Japanese democratic forces inside and outside the Diet. Of course, it should be seen that the seal of parliament is actually in the hands of the reactionaries, and they will do everything to get the new "Security Treaty" "approved." However, the Japanese people's struggle against the "Security Treaty" will not end because of this, they will persevere in the long and arduous struggle for peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality until they achieve the final victory.

    在日本国会平时会议内外的斗争
    蓝海
    去年12月29日召开的日本第三十四次国会平时会议，经过新年休假后，于今年1月30日起复会。这次会议将开到5月26日为止，整个会期约计一百五十天，1月19日，在国会休会期间，以岸信介为首的日本“全权代表团”曾到华盛顿去在新日美“安全条约”上划了押。岸信介政府不顾渴望和平的日本及世界各国人民的谴责与抗议，同美国签署了公开以中苏及亚洲人民为敌的军事同盟条约。关于这一新的日美“安全条约”的讨论，将成为第三十四次国会平时会议一项最重要的议程，因而这次平时会议是一次重要的国会会议。
    2月1日，岸信介在国会众议院和参议院两院全体会议上发表施政方针演说。岸信介在演说中虽然承认国际局势朝着缓和与和平共处的方向发展，但是却说，
  “这种形势是在东西方依靠集体安全保障体系保持军事力量的平衡的情况下产生的。”岸信介标榜那种强调所谓“自由国家仍然需要保持自己的坚强决心、团结和力量”的杜勒斯之流的“实力政策”，并且诡辩说，新日美“安全条约”是“为了和平和自由的条约”。尽管日本人民渴望实现日中关系正常化，岸信介在施政演说中对于打开日中关系只字未提。这暴露了岸信介内阁的对中国政策完全唯美帝国主义马首是瞻。
    目前，岸信介内阁和自由民主党正竭尽全力要迫使国会通过新日美“安全条约”。但是，就从自由民主党内部的情况看来，情况还不会像岸信介和“主流派”所想像的那样顺利。自由民主党内各派系的首脑人物正进行着频繁而又复杂的活动。“反主流派”想围绕着国会审议新“安全条约”问题，动摇岸信介内阁，并取而代之。去年9月和11月，前首相石桥湛山和自由民主党顾问松村谦三先后访问了中国，他们的访华也反映出了，面对着广大人民强烈要求日中关系正常化和缓和国际紧张局势的局面，自由民主党内部已发生了矛盾和动摇。
    以日本共产党和社会党为首的民主力量正在积极为阻止国会批准这项条约而进行斗争。2月2日，社会党委员长铃木茂三郎在国会众议院会议上，对政府的施政演说进行了质询。他谴责这项条约同国际紧张局势和缓的方向背道而驰，并且要求在审议新“安全条约”之前，解散众议院。铃木指出新“安全条约”敌视中国，从而为日本人民要求的日中关系正常化造成困难。
    日本共产党中央委员会主席野坂参三，在2月4日的参议院会议上发表了质询演说。野坂尖锐地揭露和谴责新“安全条约”是违反联合国宪章，以中苏为敌的侵略性军事同盟。他严正地宣称：“在这1960年开头的时候，在亚洲有两个重要的条约签字了。一个是以和平共处原则为基础的中缅友好和互不侵犯条约，另一个是以‘实力政策’为基础的侵略性的日美军事条约。”他并强调说，日本的发展方向应该是同苏联、中国友好和互不侵犯，而不是同美帝国主义缔结侵略性的军事同盟。
    目前在日本国会内，在野党的第一大党仍然是社会党。但是，从去年9月以西尾末广为首的极右翼的民主社会主义分子进行了分裂活动以后，社会党内部发生了分裂。在去年的第三十三次国会临时会议审议岸信介政府同南越签订的战争赔偿协定的时候，虽然社会党曾一再迫使岸信介政府处于狼狈的境地，然而终因民主社会主义分子的分裂活动，没有能够给岸信介政府以决定性的打击。
    如今，岸信介内阁和自由民主党的当权派所最担心的，就是在国会审议新“安全条约”时，会出现由于在野党拒绝审议而产生自由民主党单独审议的局面。这种牵涉国家命运的重要条约，如果只是由自由民主党单独审议而得到批准，必然会激起舆论的愤慨。而且自由民主党内的“反主流派”将会以此责备岸信介内阁的失败，因而有使党内斗争进一步尖锐化的危险。
    今年1月24日成立的民主社会党可以说是给了岸信介内阁和自由民主党当权派一服镇静剂。岸信介内阁的如意算盘是：民主社会党不会附和社会党拒绝国会审议新“安全条约”，这样自由民主党就可以摆脱单独审议的孤立处境。事实上，民主社会党标榜“议会主义”，扮演着自由民主党的“别动队”的角色。2月2日，民主社会党国会议员团团长水谷长三郎，代表民主社会党在众议院发表质询演说。水谷长三郎提出了所谓“安全条约”的“分阶段废除论”。根据他的解释，所谓“分阶段废除论”就是要把美军从平时驻留改为非常时驻留，而美军驻日的目的以“保卫日本”为限。这实际上只是给“安全条约”加上一些骗人的色彩，其目的无非是想要分裂阻止批准和争取废除“安全条约”的日本人民的统一行动。
    现在，在国会的众议院和参议院内自由民主党都占绝对多数的议席。它正企图依靠这种“多数”和民主社会党的协助，强迫国会批准新“安全条约”。但是在国会的外面却有着坚决反对批准新“安全条约”的真正多数。目前，日本全国各地已经成立了一千个反对修改“安全条约”的共同斗争组织。而前年反对修改“警职法”斗争时期，只有二百个共同斗争组织，这也可以看到日本人民争取和平、独立、民主斗争的迅速发展。反对修改“安全条约”共同斗争组织，以共产党、社会党、“总评”的统一行动为中心，继去年年底的全国统一行动之后，准备在今年2月25日再举行第十二次全国统一行动。
    一向站在日本人民斗争最前线的日本共产党，正竭尽一切力量，积极为使这些共同斗争组织所进行的反对“安全条约”斗争向民族民主统一战线方向发展而奋斗。值得注意的是，在人民群众反对“安全条约”斗争中，受民主社会党影响的一些群众也积极地参加了统一行动。如果国会内的民主力量成功地同这种国会外的统一行动紧密结合起来，再加上自由民主党的派系斗争的激化，岸信介内阁就将会陷于走投无路的困境，甚至有可能解散国会或实行内阁总辞职。能不能迫使岸信介内阁陷于这种地步，将有赖于日本民主力量在国会内外的统一行动的强大发展。当然，应该看到议会的印鉴实际上掌握在反动派手里，它会不顾一切使新“安全条约”得到“批准”。但是日本人民反对“安全条约”的斗争决不会因此而结束，他们将会把争取和平、独立、民主和中立的长期艰苦的斗争坚持下去，直到取得最后的胜利为止。（附图片）
