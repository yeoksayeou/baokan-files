Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 9th: According to a TASS report: The Italian Embassy in the Soviet Union held a reception on the evening of the 8th for Italian President Gronchi's visit to the Soviet Union.

Soviet guests attending the reception included Khrushchev, Voroshilov, Aristov, Kosygin, and others.

Gronchi and Khrushchev spoke at the reception successively.

Gronchi said that Italy firmly believes that it is necessary to develop new and more effective relations with the Soviet Union, and is sincerely willing to promote such relations.

He expressed the hope that his visit to the Soviet Union would "not only be limited to improving relations between Italy and the Soviet Union, but would also help to improve relations between the Soviet Union and the entire West."

In his reply, Khrushchev said that international relations have indeed improved. However, contentious issues remain to be resolved. He said: We believe that it is first necessary to resolve issues such as eliminating the remnants of World War II, concluding a German peace treaty, and completely abolishing the occupation system established in West Berlin.

Khrushchev continued, it is necessary to recognize the changes that have taken place after World War II, affirm these changes, and resolve the Berlin issue by concluding a German peace treaty. We propose abolishing the occupation system in West Berlin. We have put forward constructive proposals, and we believe these proposals are correct, and we cannot find any other realistic proposals.

Khrushchev also talked about the common understanding between the Soviet Union and Italy on the issue of developing trade and the need to develop cultural ties.

Khrushchev said, I am pleased that despite the prejudices of some groups in Italy against the Soviet Union, the Italian President has still come here.

Khrushchev said, let us establish such a relationship between our two countries, so that we can not only live in peace, but also live in friendship.

Gronchi arrived in Moscow on the 6th. On the same day, he met with Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union.

On the 8th, Soviet state leaders Voroshilov and Khrushchev held talks with Gronchi.

On the 9th, they held further talks.

    赫鲁晓夫在意大使为格隆基访苏举行的招待会上说
    必须首先缔结对德和约
    新华社莫斯科9日电　据塔斯社报道：意大利驻苏联大使馆8日晚为意大利总统格隆基访问苏联举行招待会。
    出席招待会的苏联客人有赫鲁晓夫、伏罗希洛夫、阿里斯托夫、柯西金等。
    格隆基和赫鲁晓夫先后在招待会上致词。
    格隆基说，意大利深信有必要同苏联发展新的、更有成效的关系，并且真诚地愿意促进这种关系。
    他表示希望，他这次访问苏联“不只限于改善意大利和苏联的关系，而是还会有助于改善苏联同整个西方的关系”。
    赫鲁晓夫致答词说，国际关系确实有了好转。但是，争执问题仍待解决。他说：我们认为，首先必须解决像消除第二次世界大战的残迹、缔结对德和约、彻底取消在西柏林建立的占领制度等问题。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，必须承认第二次世界大战后所发生的变化、把这种变化肯定下来，并缔结对德和约，从而解决柏林问题。我们建议取消在西柏林的占领制度。我们提出了建设性的建议，我们认为这些建议是正确的，我们找不到别的现实的建议。
    赫鲁晓夫还谈到苏联和意大利之间在发展贸易的问题上有了共同的谅解和需要发展文化联系。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我感到满意的是，尽管意大利某些集团对苏联抱有成见，但是意大利总统还是来到我们这里了。
    赫鲁晓夫说，让我们两国之间建立这样的关系，使得我们不仅能和平地生活，而且能友好地生活。
    格隆基是在6日到达莫斯科的，当天，他拜会了苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫。
    8日，苏联国家领导人伏罗希洛夫、赫鲁晓夫同格隆基举行了会谈。
