Accelerate the "Chain Reaction"
One of the powers of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is the "chain reaction." The innovation of machinery and operating methods in one process or one type of work can not only increase its own labor productivity, but also promote technical innovation and efficiency improvements in other processes and types of work. This is an important factor in promoting a universal leap forward.

For processes and types of work that have lagged behind in the technical innovation movement, they must consciously accept this driving force, strive to keep pace with advanced processes and types of work, and accelerate this "chain reaction."

At present, the on-site handling work of many construction enterprises has not yet gotten rid of heavy labor such as carrying, lifting, shouldering, and pulling, which is a weak link in the construction industry. Now, the construction site of the Beijing Refractory Materials Factory has broken through this link. We hope that construction enterprises across the country will learn from their experience and improve on-site handling efficiency; we hope that all units with relatively weak links will learn from their spirit of actively catching up with advanced processes and advanced types of work, so that all processes and all types of work can advance rapidly.

### 加速“连锁反应”

    加速“连锁反应”
    技术革新和技术革命运动的威力之一，是“连锁反应”。一道工序、一个工种革新了机具和操作方法，不仅能提高本身的劳动生产率，还能促进其他工序和工种革新技术，提高效率。这是促进普遍跃进的一个重要因素。
    对于在技术革新运动中走慢了一步的工序和工种来说，要自觉地接受这种推动力量，力争同先进工序和工种并驾齐驱，加速这种“连锁反应”。
    目前，不少建筑企业的工地搬运工作，还没有摆脱背、抬、扛、拉等笨重劳动，是建筑业的一个薄弱环节。现在，北京耐火材料厂工地已经把这个环节突破了。愿全国建筑企业都学习他们的经验，提高工地搬运效率；愿所有单位目前还比较薄弱的环节，都学习他们积极追赶先进工序、先进工种的精神，让道道工序、个个工种都能迅速前进。
