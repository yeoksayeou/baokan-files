Xinhua News Agency, February 5th: Zhang Yuzhe, Chairman of the Chinese Astronomical Society, today sent a letter to Oort, Chairman of the International Astronomical Union, strongly protesting the association's pursuit of the US imperialist conspiracy to create "two Chinas" and its acceptance of the Chiang gang's so-called "Astronomical Society of the Republic of China" as a member. He also announced that the Chinese Astronomical Society of the People's Republic of China would immediately withdraw from the International Astronomical Union and its affiliated committees and sever all ties with them.

The organization of Chinese astronomers joined the International Astronomical Union as early as 1935. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Astronomical Society of the People's Republic of China continued to cooperate with this international organization, continued to enjoy membership, and participated in the Ninth General Assembly held in Dublin in 1955 and the Tenth General Assembly held in Moscow in 1958. However, the Executive Committee meeting of the International Astronomical Union held in London in September 1959, regardless of the fact that the Chinese Astronomical Society of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate organization of Chinese astronomers and the firm opposition of representatives from the Soviet Union and other countries, illegally passed the Chiang gang's pieced-together so-called "Astronomical Society of the Republic of China" for membership. After learning of this news, the Chinese Astronomical Society of the People's Republic of China sent a letter to Oort in November of last year, lodging a strong protest and demanding that the Executive Committee revoke the illegal resolution. Oort unreasonably rejected this just demand in a reply letter last December, so the Chinese Astronomical Society of the People's Republic of China decided to withdraw from the International Astronomical Union.

In a protest letter to Oort on February 5, Zhang Yuzhe said: "In your letter, you openly compared the great People's Republic of China with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which has long been abandoned by the Chinese people, and also deliberately cited Article 3 of the Association's Charter as a 'basis,' calling Taiwan a country. This practice is obviously following the US imperialist conspiracy to create 'two Chinas.' I must once again lodge a strong protest with you about this. I have stated to you more than once that there is only one China in the world, which is the People's Republic of China. Taiwan has been an inseparable part of Chinese territory since ancient times, and the current situation is only caused by the US imperialist occupation. The reason why US imperialism has been actively engaged in the 'two Chinas' conspiracy in recent years is to attempt to legalize its occupation of our territory, Taiwan. The Taiwan issue is China's internal affair, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. We resolutely oppose the US imperialist conspiracy to create 'two Chinas' to the end."

The protest letter stated, "The Chinese Astronomical Society of the People's Republic of China is the only legal organization of Chinese astronomers, and it represents astronomers from all provinces of the country, just as it represents astronomers from Taiwan. At present, we cannot maintain contact with Taiwanese astronomers only because of the obstacles created by US imperialism. The International Astronomical Union is using this as an excuse to deny the legitimacy of our astronomical society representing Taiwan. This is a blatant interference in our internal affairs, which we can never tolerate."

The protest letter concluded, "The very fact of accepting Taiwan as a member state has long gone beyond the scope of 'science' and turned the International Astronomical Union into a tool for playing with the political conspiracy of 'two Chinas.' This is not only an act of hostility towards the Chinese people, but also violates the will of some honest scholars in the International Astronomical Union. Because the International Astronomical Union ignores our solemn protest and insists on its erroneous resolution, it has damaged the cooperative relationship between our country and the International Astronomical Union. I hereby declare on behalf of the Chinese Astronomical Society of the People's Republic of China that we will immediately withdraw from the International Astronomical Union and its affiliated committees and sever all ties with them."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 5th: Kim Doo-sam, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Industrial Technology General Alliance, wrote a letter to Oort, Chairman of the International Astronomical Union, on January 9, strongly protesting the illegal act of the association's Executive Committee in deciding to admit the Chiang Kai-shek clique's so-called "Astronomical Society of the Republic of China" as a member.

The protest letter pointed out that the Chinese Astronomical Society of the People's Republic of China is the only legal organization that truly represents Chinese astronomers. The International Astronomical Union's act of admitting the Chiang gang not only infringes upon the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in international organizations, but also seriously hinders the normal development of international cooperation in the scientific field.

Kim Doo-sam said, "This is an illegal decision made based on the US imperialist conspiracy to create 'two Chinas.' On behalf of the Korean Industrial Technology General Alliance, I strongly protest to you and demand that the International Astronomical Union rescind its decision to admit the Chiang Kai-shek clique's so-called 'Astronomical Society of the Republic of China' to the International Astronomical Union."

    严重抗议制造“两个中国”阴谋
    我国宣布退出国际天文学协会
    朝鲜工业技术总联盟抗议该会接纳蒋帮非法行为
    新华社5日讯　中华人民共和国天文学会理事长张钰哲今日致函国际天文学协会主席奥尔特，严重抗议该协会追随美帝国主义制造“两个中国”阴谋、接纳蒋帮所谓“中华民国天文学会”为会员的行为，并宣布中华人民共和国天文学会立即退出国际天文学协会及其所属各委员会，并断绝和它们的一切联系。
    中国天文学工作者的组织早在1935年就参加了国际天文学协会。中华人民共和国成立后，中华人民共和国天文学会继续与这一国际组织合作，继续享有会员资格，并且参加了1955年在都柏林举行的第九届大会和1958年在莫斯科举行的第十届大会。但是，1959年9月在伦敦举行的国际天文学协会执行委员会会议竟不顾中华人民共和国天文学会是中国天文学工作者唯一合法组织的事实和苏联等国代表的坚决反对，非法通过蒋帮拼凑的所谓“中华民国天文学会”入会。中华人民共和国天文学会在获悉此项消息后，曾于去年11月致函奥尔特，提出严重抗议，并要求执委会撤销该项非法决议。奥尔特在去年12月的回信中无理拒绝了这一正义要求，因此中华人民共和国天文学会决定退出国际天文学协会。
    张钰哲在2月5日给奥尔特的抗议信中说：奥尔特在“来信中公开地把伟大的中华人民共和国与早被我国人民唾弃的蒋介石集团相提并论，还别有用心地搬出了协会章程第三条作为‘根据’，把台湾说成一个国家，这种作法显然是追随美帝国主义制造‘两个中国’阴谋的行为。对此，我不得不再一次地向你提出严重的抗议。我曾不止一次地向你说明：世界上只有一个中国，就是中华人民共和国。台湾自古以来就是属于中国领土的不可分割的一部分，只是因为美帝国主义的侵占才造成现有的局面。美帝国主义近几年来之所以要积极地大搞‘两个中国’的阴谋，其目的是企图使强占我国领土台湾的行为合法化。台湾问题是我国的内政，中国人民一定要解放台湾，对于美帝国主义制造‘两个中国’的阴谋，我们坚决反对到底。”
    抗议信说，“中华人民共和国天文学会是中国天文学工作者唯一合法的组织，正如它代表全国各省的天文学工作者一样，代表着台湾的天文学工作者。目前我们还不能和台湾的天文学工作者保持联系，只是由于美帝国主义所造成的障碍。国际天文学协会竟以此为借口来否认我们的天文学会代表台湾的合法性，这是粗暴地干涉我国内政的行为，是我们决不能容忍的。”
    抗议信最后说，“接受台湾为会员国这一事实的本身早就超越了‘科学’范围，并使国际天文学协会变成为玩弄‘两个中国’政治阴谋的工具。这不仅是对中国人民的敌视行为，并且违反了国际天文学协会中一些正直的学者们的意志。由于国际天文学协会不顾我们的严正的抗议，坚持错误的决议，已经破坏了我国同国际天文学协会的合作关系，我谨代表中华人民共和国天文学会声明立即退出国际天文学协会及其所属各委员会，并断绝和它们的一切联系。”
    新华社平壤5日电　朝鲜工业技术总联盟中央委员会委员长金斗三在1月9日写信给国际天文学协会主席奥尔特，严正抗议这个协会执行委员会决定接纳蒋介石集团所谓“中华民国天文学会”为会员的非法行为。
    抗议信指出，中华人民共和国天文学会是真正代表中国天文学工作者的唯一合法组织。国际天文学协会接纳蒋帮入会的行为，不仅是侵犯了中华人民共和国在国际组织中的合法权利，而且也严重地阻碍世界科学领域中国际间相互合作的正常发展。
    金斗三说，这是根据美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋而作出的非法决定，我代表朝鲜工业技术总联盟向你提出强烈抗议，同时要求国际天文学协会取消接纳蒋介石集团所谓的“中华民国天文学会”参加国际天文学协会的决定。
