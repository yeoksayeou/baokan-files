Rich Livestock Product Resources

Livestock products are the hides, furs, wool, and organs taken from poultry, livestock, and wild animals. China's livestock product resources are very rich, with many varieties, including wild and domestic; those that fly in the sky and those that walk on the ground. Currently, livestock companies deal in more than four hundred kinds. These livestock products can be roughly divided into four categories: hides, wool, bristles, and casings.

Hides

Hides include the hides of pigs, cattle, horses, donkeys, mules, sheep, rabbits, dogs, cats, and wild animals such as tigers, leopards, wolves, foxes, raccoon dogs, minks, otters, rats, and muntjacs, totaling eighty or ninety kinds. Currently, the country produces more than 60 million hides of various kinds each year. Pig, cattle, horse, donkey, mule, goat, and muntjac hides are mainly used for leather making, for making suitcases, shoes, leather clothing, and various industrial leathers. Sheepskin, dog ​​skin, cat skin, rabbit skin, and fox skin, mink skin, sable skin, raccoon skin, civet skin, otter skin, muskrat skin, gray squirrel skin, and weasel skin are usually used to make leather coats, hats, and collars. Among them, the most promising is rabbit skin. Because rabbits reproduce quickly and the hides are light and soft, especially the improved rabbit skin is of better quality. Using this kind of skin to make women's coats, children's coats and collars is not inferior to expensive fine fur. Sable and sable skins are also rare hides in the world.

Wool

Includes sheep's wool, goat's wool, cashmere, camel hair, goose feathers, duck feathers, rooster saddle feathers, rabbit hair, cattle hair, colored feathers, and various livestock tail hair and miscellaneous hair. Chicken, goose, and duck feathers are excellent raw materials for making down quilts, down pillows, cushions, and seat cushions. Feathers can also be used to make badminton, shuttlecocks or decorations. Wool, cashmere, and various cattle and horse hair can be used to make high-grade clothing materials, wool yarn, felt blankets, etc. The pure white rabbit hair grown by Angora rabbits is smooth and soft, and is also a high-quality textile raw material. This kind of hair can be blended with wool and silk to weave beautiful rabbit hair shirts, shawls, scarves, etc., and can also be woven into various woolens and serge, which are light, warm and beautiful.

Bristles

Are important raw materials for light industry and handicrafts. Many brushes, bows and strings on musical instruments are made of bristles. The pig bristles produced in China are elastic and tough, and can withstand high temperatures, making them most suitable for making various machine brushes.

Casings

Are made by scraping off the inner and outer serous layers and mucous membrane layers of pig, cattle, and sheep intestines, leaving a translucent and tough film. Casings are mainly used as the outer covering for sausages and cured sausages. Casings made from the small intestines of goats and sheep can be made into surgical sutures (catgut) and various bowstrings.

Since the Great Leap Forward, various localities have taken pig raising as the key link, vigorously raising pigs, cattle, sheep, ducks, geese, rabbits and other livestock and poultry. In addition, various localities have also vigorously developed hunting production and wild animal breeding, making livestock product resources even more abundant. Since 1956, provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have established more than one hundred large and small wildlife farms. Preliminary trial breeding experience has been gained with silver foxes, minks, muskrats, coypu, etc. This is a pioneering undertaking in China's breeding history and is of great significance for improving the people's living standards.

    丰富的畜产品资源
    畜产品，是从家禽、家畜和野生动物身上取下来的皮、毛、绒和内脏。我国的畜产品资源非常丰富，种类很多，有野生的和家养的；有天上飞的，也有地下走的。目前，仅畜产公司经营的就有四百种以上。这些畜产品大体上可分为皮张、绒毛、鬃尾和肠衣四类。	皮张
    皮张包括猪、牛、马、驴、骡、羊、兔、狗、猫的皮张和野生的虎、豹、狼、狐、貉、貂、獭、鼠、麂的皮张，总共有八、九十种。现在全国每年产各种皮六千万张以上。猪、牛、马、驴、骡、山羊、麂皮主要用来制革，做皮箱、皮鞋、皮衣和各种工业用革。绵羊皮、狗皮、猫皮、兔皮和狐皮、貂皮、扫雪皮、貉子皮、猸子皮、水獭皮、香鼠皮、灰鼠皮、艾虎皮等，通常都用来做皮衣、皮帽和皮领。其中最有发展前途的是兔皮。因为兔子繁殖快、皮张轻软，尤其是改良兔皮的质量更好。用这种皮做女大衣、童大衣和衣领，并不亚于高贵的细皮。紫貂和扫雪皮，也是世界上稀有的皮张。	绒毛
    包括绵羊毛、山羊毛、山羊绒、骆驼毛、鹅毛、鸭毛、公鸡三把毛、兔毛、牛毛、彩色羽毛等和各种牲畜尾毛和杂毛。鸡、鹅、鸭的羽毛，是制作羽绒被、羽绒枕、靠垫、座垫的上好原料。翎毛还可以做羽毛球、板球或装饰品。羊毛、羊绒和各种牛、马毛，能做高级衣料、绒线、毡毯等。安哥拉兔生长的洁白的兔毛，光润柔滑，也是一种上等的纺织原料，这种毛可以和羊毛、绢丝混纺，织成漂亮的兔毛衫、披巾、围巾等，也可以织成各种呢绒、哔叽，轻暖而美观。	鬃尾
    是重要的轻工、手工业原料，很多刷子、乐器上的弓、弦都是用鬃尾做的。我国出产的猪鬃富有弹性和韧性，并能耐高温，最适合于制做各种机器用刷。	肠衣
    是把猪牛羊的肠的内外浆层和粘膜层刮去，剩下的半透明而又坚韧的薄膜。肠衣主要用来做香肠和腊肠的外衣。用山羊、绵羊的小肠制成的肠衣，可做成医疗用的缝合线（羊肠线）和各种弓弦。
    大跃进以来，各地以养猪为纲，大养猪、牛、羊、鸭、鹅、兔等家畜家禽。此外，各地还大力发展狩猎生产和饲养野牲，畜产品的资源更加丰富。1956年以来，各省、市、自治区已办了大小一百多个野生动物饲养场。已经取得初步试养经验的有银狐、水貂、麝鼠、海狸鼠等，这是我国饲养史上的创举，对于改善我国人民生活有重要的意义。　（陈中元等）
