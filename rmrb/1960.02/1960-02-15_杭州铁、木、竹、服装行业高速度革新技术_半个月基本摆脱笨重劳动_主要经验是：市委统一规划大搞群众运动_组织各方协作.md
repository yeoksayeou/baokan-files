Hangzhou, February 14th (reporter dispatch) -- The iron, wood, bamboo, and clothing industries in Hangzhou, comprising more than 300 factories (cooperatives) and over 20,000 workers, have launched a new upsurge in technological innovation and revolution. In half a month, these four industries have collectively manufactured more than 2,000 machines and tools of various types. The degree of mechanized and semi-mechanized operation, calculated by the number of people, has increased from over 30% at the end of October last year to over 70%, and calculated by work processes, has reached over 90%. This has basically eliminated heavy manual labor, increased production capacity by more than double, and saved 5,000 laborers to support other production.

In the past, the iron, wood, bamboo, and clothing industries in Hangzhou mostly used manual operations. Since the second half of last year, various industries have launched technological innovation and technological revolution movements. The Hangzhou Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to launch a new upsurge in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement on this basis. In early January of this year, it put forward the slogan of "Working with the vigor of developing iron and steel, fighting for fifteen days, and making a big splash in the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations in the iron, wood, bamboo, and clothing industries," and formulated a plan. Leading cadres at all levels went deep into the front line of production to innovate technology with the masses.

Fully mobilizing the masses, relying on their own efforts, using indigenous methods, and cooperating with each other are important reasons for the rapid development of the technological innovation movement in Hangzhou. After many factories disclosed the difficulties in technological innovation to the masses, the masses said heroically, "No difficulty is insurmountable, and hard work can move mountains." When the Tangqi Iron and Wood Farm Implement Factory was manufacturing springboard hammers, they lacked the necessary raw materials and oxygen cutting equipment. The workers used indigenous methods to forge an eight-inch square steel ingot into a hammerhead; without cement, they used large stone slabs instead of cement as a base; if they didn't understand the technology, they learned from brother factories and held Zhuge Liang meetings to study. They made eight springboard hammers in ten days. After the broad masses of workers were mobilized, many problems were solved. There was also a great upsurge of communist cooperation between regions, between industries, and between factories, with mutual support. After many simple machines were put into operation, electric motors were needed, and many departments provided some scrap materials to support them, and the problem of hundreds of motors was quickly solved.

The great victory of Hangzhou's iron, wood, bamboo, and clothing industries in their march towards mechanization and semi-mechanization has greatly promoted current production and created good conditions for better and more comprehensive sustained leaps forward. After these machines and equipment were put into production, production efficiency generally increased by five to ten times, and the highest reached sixty times, equivalent to adding 1.5 million workdays. After using machines for production, many products became more uniform, smooth, tightly sewn, and sturdy; the utilization rate of the main raw materials, bamboo and wood, increased by 15% to 30% respectively compared with the end of last year, resulting in a new situation of more, faster, better, and more economical, and a comprehensive leap forward.

Recently, the Municipal Party Committee organized an advanced experience promotion team to inspect the technological innovation and technological revolution movement in these industries, and adopted forms such as operational demonstrations, training courses, and on-site skill competitions to promote advanced operating methods and experiences and rapidly improve workers' operating skills on new machines.

### 杭州铁、木、竹、服装行业高速度革新技术  半个月基本摆脱笨重劳动  主要经验是：市委统一规划大搞群众运动　组织各方协作

    杭州铁、木、竹、服装行业高速度革新技术
    半个月基本摆脱笨重劳动
    主要经验是：市委统一规划大搞群众运动　组织各方协作
    本报杭州14日电　杭州市铁、木、竹、服装四个手工业行业三百多个厂（社）二万多职工，掀起了技术革新和技术革命的新高潮。半个月内，四个行业共制成各种机器、工具二千多台，机械操作程度和半机械操作程度，按人数计算，由去年10月底的30％提高到70％以上，按工序计算，达到90％以上。这就基本上摆脱了笨重的手工劳动，使生产能力提高一倍多，并节约了五千个劳动力支援其他生产。
    杭州市铁、木、竹、服装业，过去大都用手工操作。去年下半年以来，各行业开展了技术革新和技术革命运动。中共杭州市委决定在这个基础上掀起技术革新和技术革命运动新高潮，在今年1月初提出了“以大办钢铁的劲头，奋战十五天，大闹铁、木、竹、服装业手工操作机械化半机械化”的行动口号，并制定了规划。各级领导干部深入到生产第一线，和群众一起革新技术。
    充分发动群众，自力更生，土法上马，相互协作，是杭州市手工业技术革新运动迅速发展的重要原因。许多厂把技术革新中的困难向群众交底以后，群众豪迈地说：“千难万难都不难，干劲能移万重山”。塘栖铁木农具厂制造跳板锤时，缺少必要的原料，没有氧气切割设备，工人们就用土办法把八寸方圆的钢锭锻打成锤头；没有水泥，就用大石板代替水泥做底座，不懂技术就到兄弟厂取经，开诸葛亮会研究，十天内就制成了八台跳板锤。广大职工发动起来后，许多问题都解决了。地区与地区、行业与行业、厂与厂之间还大兴共产主义协作之风，相互支援。许多简易机器上马后，需要电动机，许多部门就拿出部分废旧物料来支援，几百只马达的问题就迅速解决了。
    杭州市铁、木、竹、服装业向机械化和半机械化进军的巨大胜利，大大地促进了当前的生产，为更好、更全面的持续跃进，创造了良好条件。这些机器、设备投入生产以后，生产效率一般提高了五倍至十倍，最高的达到六十倍，等于增加一百五十万个劳动日。使用机器生产以后，许多产品更加均匀、光洁、密缝、坚固；主要原料毛竹和木材的利用率，分别比去年年底提高了15％到30％，出现了多快好省、全面跃进的新局面。
    最近，市委组织了先进经验促进团，对这些行业的技术革新和技术革命运动进行检查，并且采取操作表演、办训练班、现场比巧等形式，推广先进的操作方法和经验，迅速提高工人对新机器的操作技术。
