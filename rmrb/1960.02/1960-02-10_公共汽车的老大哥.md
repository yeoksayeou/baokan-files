    The Big Brother of Buses
    Following the successful trial production of a double-decker bus and a two-section articulated bus last year, the Chengdu Transportation Bureau of Sichuan Province has recently successfully trial-produced a three-section articulated bus.
    This bus is sixty-six meters long and can carry more than 350 passengers, which is more than three times the capacity of an ordinary bus.
    The bus has one hundred spacious and comfortable seats and a dedicated broadcasting room. It is particularly suitable for point-to-point routes with concentrated passengers and charter services for large gatherings.

    公共汽车的老大哥
    四川省成都市交通局继去年试制成功双层公共汽车和两节通道式公共汽车之后，又于最近试制成功一辆三节通道式公共汽车。
    这种汽车车身全长六十六米，可载乘客三百五十多人，比普通公共汽车增大三倍多。
    这种汽车车厢内设有一百个宽大舒适的座位和一个专用广播室，这种汽车特别适用于乘客集中的点线和大型集会包车使用。
