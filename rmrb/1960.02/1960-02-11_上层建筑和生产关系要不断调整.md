    Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people, adhering to the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, achieved a continued Great Leap Forward in 1959 on the basis of the Great Leap Forward of 1958, and completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. The three magic weapons and the two years of continuous Great Leap Forward have brought China's socialist construction into a new stage of continuous leaping forward that is both high-speed and proportionate. High-speed development of social productive forces is the soul of the General Line and the strong desire of the Chinese people.
    Social productive forces include two elements: people and things. People are the main body of social productive forces. By people, we mean laborers with a certain level of political and ideological consciousness and a certain amount of production experience and labor skills. Things are the object of social productive forces. By things, we mean the means of production and the objects of labor. The combination of these two factors, people and things, constitutes social productive forces. Among the two elements of people and things, we believe that people are always the primary productive force. The revolutionary class itself is the most powerful social productive force and also the representative of social productive forces. The Chinese working class and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are the representatives of social productive forces. They demand to change the "poor and blank" situation, to build the socialist cause at high speed, to adjust and improve the relations of production, and to break through all decadent ideologies and other inapplicable parts of the superstructure. These demands are the declaration of social productive forces demanding development and the bugle call of the times demanding progress. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have always shared the same breath with the masses, concentrated their demands, formulated the General Line, and the Great Leap Forward generated by the General Line, as well as the People's Communes that emerged to meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward, are of course fully in line with the objective laws of the relations of production adapting to the development of productive forces and the superstructure adapting to the development of the economic base.
    The relations of production are determined by the productive forces, and the superstructure is determined by the economic base. However, once the relations of production and the superstructure are produced, they have their own relative independence and have a significant reaction on the productive forces and the economic base. The relations of production can play a role in liberating and promoting productive forces, and they can also play a role in restricting and hindering productive forces. The same is true for the superstructure to the economic base. The relations of production not only have a general reaction on the productive forces, and the superstructure to the economic base, but also in the contradiction between productive forces and relations of production, and in the contradiction between the superstructure and the economic base, the relations of production and the superstructure, under certain conditions, turn around and show their primary decisive role. When productive forces cannot develop without changing the relations of production, the change of the relations of production plays a major role. As Lenin said, "Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement" ("Collected Works of Lenin," Volume 4), the creation and advocacy of revolutionary theory plays a major and decisive role. When the superstructure of politics, culture, etc., hinders the development of the economic base, the innovation of the superstructure becomes the main and decisive thing. We admit the enormous reaction of the relations of production and the superstructure to the productive forces and the economic base, and admit that under certain conditions, the status of the relations of production and productive forces, the superstructure and the economic base can be transformed into each other, and the relations of production and the superstructure turn around to become the main and decisive things, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, this is precisely adhering to dialectical materialism and avoiding mechanical materialism.
    The history of the entire human society is the history of the dialectical development of productive forces and relations of production, the history of the dialectical development of economic base and superstructure. However, these two laws are not isolated, insulated, and mutually exclusive in the process of social development, but are closely linked and combined. The law that the relations of production must be adapted to the nature of the productive forces always combines with the law that the superstructure must be adapted to the economic base to pave the way for itself. When the development of social productive forces has contradicted the old relations of production, new advanced concepts and theories arise accordingly. In the historical process of the metabolism of social modes of production, the struggle against the old modes of production is always the criticism of weapons preceding the weapons of criticism. Of course, the criticism of weapons cannot replace the weapons of criticism, but, as Marx said: "Of course, the weapon of criticism cannot replace criticism by weapons, material force must be overthrown by material force; but theory, once it has gripped the masses, also becomes a material force." ("Marx and Engels Collected Works" Volume 1). This new and advanced concept and theory, in a fierce struggle with the old, conservative, and reactionary concepts and theories, can not only mobilize the people but also organize the people to change the old and backward social system, establish a new and advanced social system, change the old and backward relations of production, establish new and advanced relations of production, and eliminate obstacles that hinder the development of social productive forces, so that productive forces can develop rapidly. The proletarian revolution replaces private ownership with public ownership, and socialist relations of production cannot be formed in the womb of capitalist society. Therefore, for the proletariat, ideological transformation precedes political transformation, and political transformation precedes economic transformation. Seizing political power is only the beginning of the revolution, not the end of the revolution.
    After our Party was born, it led the Chinese people through more than 20 years of civil war, seized power by violent means, completely smashed the reactionary state apparatus, established the dictatorship of the proletariat, and then carried out socialist revolution on the economic front, eliminated capitalist ownership and individual ownership, and established socialist ownership by the whole people and collective ownership, thereby promoting the rapid development of productive forces at a speed that the old society did not have. However, it is not enough and not consolidated to only have the socialist revolution on the economic front. Therefore, it is also necessary to carry out socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. It is precisely because we have not only achieved basic victory on the economic front, but also further achieved decisive victory in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, that the broad masses of the people are in high spirits and full of energy, which has opened up the road for the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. The People's Communes also emerged under such circumstances.
    Advanced theory and advanced thinking have great significance for the rapid development of productive forces. The development process of agricultural cooperativization in our country is a vivid example. People once believed that there could be no cooperativization without tractors, so they advocated "cutting off" cooperatives. However, Comrade Mao Zedong's advanced theory believes that the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are enthusiastically demanding cooperativization. Through mutual aid teams, elementary cooperatives, and advanced cooperatives, with the leadership of the Party and the masses' own experience, cooperativization can not only be realized but also gradually improved without tractors. In our country's rural areas, not only advanced cooperatives have been realized, but also People's Communes have been established, which has greatly improved productive forces, thus making the mechanization of our country's agriculture also a possible thing. The General Line of socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes can be said to be the creative development of Marxism-Leninism by our Party under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong.
    In order to realize a communist society in the future, we must constantly adjust and improve the superstructure to promote the development of the economic base, and constantly adjust and improve the relations of production to promote the development of productive forces. Constantly develop and improve the form of socialist ownership, so that the coexistence of the two public ownership systems develops into the comprehensive ownership by the whole people of socialism. Constantly consolidate and develop the communist relationship between people. Constantly increase the communist factors in distribution, and carry the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts to the end.

### 上层建筑和生产关系要不断调整

    上层建筑和生产关系要不断调整
    在党中央和毛主席领导下，我国人民坚持总路线，坚持大跃进，坚持人民公社，又在1958年大跃进基础上实现了1959年的继续大跃进，并且提前三年完成了第二个五年计划主要指标。三大法宝和两年的继续大跃进，使我国社会主义建设进入既是高速度，又是按比例地持续跃进的新阶段。高速度地发展社会生产力，是总路线的灵魂，是我国人民的强烈愿望。
    社会生产力包括人和物这两个要素。人是社会生产力的主体，所谓人，指的是具有一定的政治思想觉悟，和具有一定的生产经验、劳动技能的劳动者；物是社会生产力的客体，所谓物，包括生产工具和劳动对象。人和物两个因素互相结合，构成社会生产力。在人和物两个要素中，我们认为，人总是首要的生产力。革命阶级本身是一种最强大的社会生产力，也是社会生产力的代表者。我国工人阶级和广大贫农和下中农，就是社会生产力的代表者。他们要求改变“一穷二白”的面貌，要求高速度建设社会主义事业，要求调整和改进生产关系，要求冲破一切腐朽的意识形态和上层建筑中的其他不适用部分。这些要求就是社会生产力要求发展的宣言，就是时代要求前进的号角。党中央和毛主席一直是同群众共呼吸的，集中他们的要求，制订成为总路线，由总路线而产生的大跃进，以及适应大跃进需要而出现的人民公社，当然是完全符合生产关系同生产力发展相适应、上层建筑同经济基础发展相适应的客观规律。
    生产关系是由生产力决定的，上层建筑是由经济基础决定的，但是，一当生产关系、上层建筑产生出来之后，又具有自己的相对独立性，对于生产力、经济基础发生重大的反作用。生产关系可以起解放、推进生产力的作用，同样可以起束缚、阻碍生产力的作用。上层建筑对经济基础也是如此。生产关系对生产力、上层建筑对经济基础不但有一般的反作用，而且在生产力和生产关系的矛盾中，在上层建筑和经济基础的矛盾中，生产关系、上层建筑在一定的条件下，又转过来表现其为主要的决定的作用。当着不变更生产关系，生产力就不能发展的时候，生产关系的变更就起了主要的作用。当着如同列宁所说“没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动”（“列宁全集”第四卷）的时候，革命理论的创立和提倡就起了主要的决定的作用。当着政治、文化等等上层建筑阻碍着经济基础的发展的时候，对于上层建筑的革新就成为主要的决定的东西了。我们承认生产关系、上层建筑对于生产力、经济基础的巨大反作用，承认在一定条件下，生产关系和生产力、上层建筑和经济基础的地位可以互相转化，而生产关系、上层建筑反转来成为主要的决定的东西，正如毛泽东同志所说的，这正是坚持了辩证唯物论，避免了机械唯物论。
    整个人类社会的历史，就是生产力与生产关系的辩证发展的历史，经济基础与上层建筑的辩证发展的历史。但是，这两个规律在社会发展过程中，不是彼此孤立地绝缘地互不相谋的，而是密切联系、互相结合的，生产关系一定要和生产力性质相适应的规律，总是结合上层建筑一定要和经济基础相适应的规律，来为自己开辟道路的。当社会生产力的发展已经同旧的生产关系发生矛盾的时候，新的先进的观念、理论就应运而生。在社会生产方式新陈代谢的历史过程中，对于旧的生产方式的斗争，总是批判的武器先于武器的批判，当然批判的武器不能代替武器的批判，但是，正如马克思所说的：“批判的武器当然不能代替武器的批判，物质力量只能用物质力量来摧毁；但是理论一经掌握群众，也会变成物质力量。”（“马恩全集”第一卷）这种新的先进的观念、理论，同旧的保守的反动的观念、理论进行剧烈的斗争，不但可以动员人民而且可以组织人民来改变旧的落后的社会制度，建立新的先进的社会制度，改变旧的落后的生产关系，建立新的先进的生产关系，扫除阻碍社会生产力发展的障碍，使生产力能够迅速向前发展。无产阶级革命是以公有制代替私有制，社会主义生产关系不可能在资本主义社会母腹中形成，因此，对于无产阶级说来，思想的变革先于政治的变革，政治的变革又先于经济的变革，取得政权只是革命的开始，不是革命的结束。
    我们党诞生之后，领导中国人民，经过二十多年的国内战争，用暴力手段夺取了政权，彻底打碎了反动的国家机器，建立了无产阶级专政，然后又进行了经济战线上的社会主义革命，消灭了资本主义的所有制和个体所有制，建立了社会主义的全民所有制和集体所有制，从而促使生产力以旧社会所没有的速度迅速发展。但是，仅仅有经济战线上的社会主义革命，还是不够的并且是不巩固的。所以，还必须进行政治战线、思想战线上的社会主义革命。正是由于我们不仅取得了经济战线上的基本胜利，而且又进一步取得了政治战线、思想战线上社会主义革命的决定性胜利，广大人民群众精神振奋，干劲冲天，这才开辟了社会主义建设大跃进的道路。人民公社也就是在这样的情形下产生出来的。
    先进理论先进的思想，对于生产力的飞速发展具有重大意义。我国农业合作化的发展过程，就是一个生动的例子。人们曾经认为，没有拖拉机就谈不到合作化，因此就主张“砍掉”合作社。可是毛泽东同志的先进理论认为，广大的贫农和下中农是热烈要求合作化的，经过互助组、初级合作社和高级合作社，有了党的领导和群众自己的经验，在没有拖拉机的条件下，合作化不仅可以实现，而且可以逐步提高。在我国农村中不但实现了高级合作社，而且建立了人民公社，大大提高了生产力，因而使我国农业的机械化也成为可能的事情了。社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社，可以说是我们的党在毛泽东同志的领导下对马克思列宁主义的创造性发展。
    为了在将来实现共产主义社会，我们必须对上层建筑不断地进行调整和改善，以促进经济基础的发展，对生产关系不断地进行调整和改善，以促进生产力的发展。不断发展和不断提高社会主义所有制形式，使两种公有制并存局面发展成为社会主义的全面的全民所有制。不断巩固和发展人与人之间的共产主义关系。不断增长分配方面的共产主义因素，把政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命进行到底。
