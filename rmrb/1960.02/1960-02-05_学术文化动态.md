    The Soviet Union is about to publish the "Encyclopedia Dictionary of Physics"
    In recent years, the Soviet Union has published a series of books introducing various problems in modern physics. However, experts working in technology and natural sciences still feel the lack of a reference book that summarizes physics and its numerous adjacent parts. In order to meet the needs of the scientific community, the Soviet Encyclopedia Scientific Publishing House is preparing to publish a four-volume "Encyclopedia Dictionary of Physics" to explore various problems in physics, from those with practical value to those with laboratory research value and abstract concepts. The scope of subjects included is extremely broad. Except for historical and biographical knowledge, the dictionary has sufficient reference materials on issues related to modern physical science. The dictionary is expected to contain six thousand articles and four thousand illustrations. The first volume is ready for printing.
    Germany publishes "Complete Works of Wilhelm Pieck"
    Wilhelm Pieck was an outstanding activist in the international communist movement and a beloved leader of the German working class. The Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party made a resolution to publish Pieck's complete works. This complete works consists of about fifteen volumes, the first of which has been published by the "Kietz" publishing house of the German Democratic Republic. Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, wrote the "Preface" for the first volume.
    The first volume of "Complete Works of Wilhelm Pieck" includes Pieck's works from August 1904 to June 1919. These works indicate the path of Pieck's transformation from an ordinary worker to a leader of the German proletariat, demonstrating his contributions in the struggle against revisionism, opportunism, and sectarianism in the German workers' movement, against German imperialism and militarism, and for the establishment of a new type of Marxist party.

    苏联即将出版“物理学百科全书辞典”
    近年来，苏联出版了一系列介绍现代物理学各种问题的书籍。但是，在技术和自然科学方面工作的专家，还感到缺乏一种概括物理学及其为数甚多的相邻部分的参考书。为了满足科学界的这个要求，苏联百科全书科学出版社正准备出版一种四卷本的“物理学百科全书辞典”，以探讨物理学中从具有实用价值的开始到具有实验室研究价值和抽象概念性质的各种问题。包括的学科范围极其广泛，除了历史和传记性的知识没有收入以外，有关现代物理科学的问题，在辞典中都有充分的参考材料。这部辞典预计将容纳六千篇文章和四千幅插图。第一卷已准备付印。
    德国出版“威廉·皮克全集”
    威廉·皮克是国际共产主义运动杰出的活动家和德国工人阶级敬爱的领袖。德国统一社会党中央委员会，曾就出版皮克的全集作出决议。这部全集约有十五卷，其中第一卷已由德意志民主共和国的“基茨”出版社出版。德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希为第一卷写了“序言”。
    “威廉·皮克全集”的第一卷，包括皮克1904年8月至1919年6月的著作。这些著作指明了皮克从一个普通工人变为德国无产阶级领袖的道路，表明了他在反对德国工人运动中的修正主义、机会主义和宗派主义，反对德国帝国主义、军国主义，以及争取建立新型的马克思主义政党的斗争中所作出的贡献。
