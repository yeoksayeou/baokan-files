    Spare No Effort to Expand Sown Acreage
    The Spring Festival is over, and various regions are arranging their production for the year.
    This year, the glorious task of our country's farmers is to strive for even better and more comprehensive continuous leaps forward on the basis of the continuous two-year leap forward in agricultural production. To achieve this glorious task, it is necessary to do a good job in all aspects, and expanding the spring sowing acreage is a very important aspect of this.
    A bumper harvest consists of two factors: one is expanding the sown area, and the other is increasing the yield per unit area. This is the policy of multiple planting for high yield and multiple harvest proposed by our Party. However, some people say that China has a large population and little land, so it is impossible to expand the sown area. This is not right. Several news items published in this newspaper today powerfully illustrate that the potential for land utilization is enormous. Whether in areas with a large population and little land or areas with a small population and much land, as long as we think of ways adapted to local conditions, we can expand the sown area and increase the multiple cropping index.
    Expanding arable land and achieving multiple planting for multiple harvests is the common aspiration and urgent requirement of the broad masses of farmers, and it is also an important policy of the Party for developing agricultural production. Many places have formulated plans to expand the sown area based on this reasonable demand of the masses; however, there are also some communes that have somewhat neglected this point when arranging production plans, worrying that expanding the spring sowing area will affect summer sowing, or worrying about insufficient water and fertilizer or labor. These are of course issues that should be considered. Planting crops of course requires comprehensive arrangements in order to achieve a comprehensive leap forward centered on grain; planting crops of course cannot be separated from water and fertilizer, let alone labor. However, first, we are not expanding the sown area of one crop by squeezing out other crops, but by expanding arable land and increasing land utilization rates. As mentioned before, the potential in this area is very large. Secondly, as for water, fertilizer, or other aspects, it should be said that this year's conditions are better and more advantageous than any previous year: last year, the country added 70 million mu of irrigated area in one water conservancy year, and the original irrigation systems were also greatly improved; pig production has seen a leap forward development, and can provide more and more high-quality fertilizer; after two years of tool reform movement, coupled with the unified allocation and reasonable arrangement of labor force by the "large-scale and public" people's commune, the labor problem can also be better solved. These are all superior conditions for us to expand the sown area and strive for a greater harvest. Perhaps there are still some places that do indeed have difficulties with insufficient water and fertilizer, but this does not matter, as the situation will change through people's efforts. Having enough water and fertilizer can prompt us to expand the sown area; expanding the sown area first can also prompt us to further change the situation of insufficient water and fertilizer.
    The spring plowing season is approaching. In order to ensure a comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production, places where production and sowing plans have not yet been arranged should seize the time, and on the basis of summarizing the experience of increasing planting and expanding planting last year, proceed from the requirements of increasing production throughout the year, look ahead and behind, rationally arrange crop rotations, and spare no effort to expand the spring sowing area to achieve multiple planting for multiple harvests.

### 千方百计扩大播种面积

    千方百计扩大播种面积
    春节已过，各地正在安排一年的生产。
    今年，我国农民的光荣任务，是在农业生产取得了连续两年大跃进的基础上，争取更好更全面的连续跃进。实现这个光荣任务，需要作好各方面的工作，扩大春耕播种面积就是其中很重要的一个方面。
    大丰收是由两个因素构成的：一个是扩大播种面积，一个是提高单位面积产量。这就是我们党提出的多种高产多收的方针。但是，有人说我国人多地少，无法扩大播种面积。这话是不对的。今天本报发表的几个新闻，有力地说明了土地的利用潜力是十分巨大的。不论在人多地少的地区还是人少地多的地区，只要因地制宜地想办法，都能扩大播种面积和提高复种指数。
    扩大耕地面积，实现多种多收，是广大农民的共同愿望和迫切要求，也是党的发展农业生产的重要政策。许多地方根据群众这种合理要求，制订了扩大播种面积的计划；但是，也还有一些公社在安排生产计划的时候，对这一条有些忽视，担心扩大春播面积会影响夏播，担心水肥不足或劳力不够。这当然都是应当考虑的问题。种庄稼当然要全面安排，才能实现以粮食为中心的全面跃进；种庄稼当然也离不开水肥，更离不开劳力。但是，第一，我们不是用挤掉别种作物的办法扩大另一种作物的播种面积，而是用扩大耕地面积和提高土地利用率的办法扩大播种面积。如前所述，这方面的潜力是很大的。其次，至于水肥或其他方面，应该说，今年的条件比以往任何一年都更好更优越了：去年一个水利年度全国已增加灌溉面积七千万亩，原有的灌溉系统也得到很大的改善；养猪生产有了飞跃的发展，可以越来越多地供给优质肥料；经过两年来的工具改革运动，再加上“一大二公”的人民公社对劳动力的统一调配和合理安排，劳动力问题也可以更好的解决。这些都是我们扩大播种面积争取更大丰收的优越条件。也许还有些地方的确还仍然存在着水肥不足的困难，这也不要紧，经过人们的努力，情况是会起变化的。有了足够的水肥可以促使我们扩大播种面积；先扩大播种面积，也能够促使我们进一步改变水肥不足的情况。
    春耕季节就要到了，为了保证农业生产的全面跃进，生产播种计划还没有安排好的地方，应当抓紧时间，在总结去年增种扩种经验的基础上，从全年增产的要求出发，瞻前顾后，合理安排茬口，千方百计地扩大春播面积，实现多种多收。
