In order to build our country into a strong socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture as soon as possible, we must make our scientific undertakings catch up with the world level rapidly. Hundreds of millions of workers are responding to the Party's call, setting great ambitions, making firm resolutions, boosting their energy, scaling peaks, and marching towards science and technology in an all-round way!

Speaking of "scaling peaks," scenes from the movie "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" flashed through my mind again; in order to annihilate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on the top of Mount Hua, the heroes, full of courage, climbed the "West Mountain," which people sighed was "unclimbable even for birds," with ingenuity and bravery, and finally won the victory. The more I think about it, the more I feel that the idiom "too high to reach" should be added with one word, changed to "no summit too high to conquer." There are three reasons:

Since ancient times, in people's minds, nothing is higher than the blue sky. Even if there are nine heavens, the ninth heaven should be the supreme one. However, in our socialist era of scientific prosperity, not long ago, the Soviet Union's cosmic rocket had already flown to the moon, knocking on the door of the Moon Palace. The Moon Palace in the sky will soon become virgin land on earth, and people have already smelled the aroma of Wu Gang's osmanthus wine. Human wisdom is infinite. We will not only conquer the moon, but also conquer Mars, Venus..., and even the entire universe. In our view, there are only things that have not yet been recognized, and nothing that cannot be recognized. This is one.

We live in such a happy era, with the wise leadership of the Party, ensuring that scientific undertakings embark on the broad road of benefiting peace and humanity. The Party has created all the conditions for the development of science, and has the only correct dialectical materialist worldview as a guide. This is two.

In the old society, science was monopolized by the reactionary ruling class. The wisdom of the people was like being locked in a heavy prison, unable to be fully developed. Today, the people are the masters of the country, and the superior socialist system and a strong motherland have opened up infinitely broad ground for the people's wisdom to be used. Everyone has become a "wise star," and everyone is Zhuge Liang. For the sake of the glorious communist ideal, working together with one heart and one mind, learning from each other, what else is there to worry about? This is three.

With these three points, it is just like "everything is ready, only the east wind is lacking." The east wind is that we set great ambitions, make firm resolutions, muster enough energy, and study diligently, and we will definitely catch up with the world's scientific level rapidly. Look at the demobilized soldiers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who only have a primary school education, didn't they master various complex scientific technologies in just one year? A group of demobilized soldiers from the Institute of Organic Chemistry, after several months of research, put forward twenty-seven suggestions for technical innovation, and the work report written by demobilized soldier Zhuang Dongchen, some parts of it exceeded the level of recent college graduates. Some demobilized soldiers are determined to reach the level of intern researchers in two or three years. What a revolutionary ambition! The heroes of Mount Hua in those years are today tenaciously climbing another new peak of scientific and cultural knowledge. (See the first page of the China Youth Daily on January 8th)

Climbing peaks, the premise is revolutionary ambition. If in the face of the peak, one just sighs like Li Bai did in those years, "Alas, how dangerous and high it is!" "It is more difficult than ascending to the blue sky." Then, if you want to muster the strength to climb up, it is not an easy task. If you also climb the mountain step by step, but stop as soon as you taste it, and when you encounter a place where "the path winds around, and there is a pavilion with outstretched eaves," you sit down and rest and no longer want to go up, then the peak will forever become something that can only be hoped for but not reached. Those who have not made up their minds to climb the peak, or those who give up halfway on the mountain road, will of course not be able to enjoy the wonders and beauty of the mountain top, and cannot say that this is a style of "striving to be upstream."

"In science, there is no royal road, and only those who do not dread the fatiguing climb up its steep paths have a chance of gaining the luminous summits." ("Das Kapital", Volume One) As long as you set your ambition, and do not fear hardship, no matter how high, you will always "reach the luminous summits"!

    无高不可攀
    钟欣泰
    为了早日把我国建成具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国，必须使科学事业迅速赶上世界水平。亿万劳动者响应党的号召，立大志、下决心、鼓干劲、攀高峰，向科学技术全面进军！
    提起“攀高峰”，脑际又浮现了电影“智取华山”里的那些惊心动魄的镜头；为了歼灭华山顶上的蒋匪军，英雄们浑身是胆，从没有路的地方，机智勇敢地攀上那被人叹为“鸟飞不上”的“西岳”，终于赢得了胜利。我越想，就越是觉得“高不可攀”这句成语应该加一个字，改成“无高不可攀”。理由有三：
    自古以来，人的概念里，高者莫过于青天。就算有九重天吧，第九重总该是至高无上的了。然而在我们这科学昌明的社会主义时代里，曾几何时，苏联的宇宙火箭已经飞上月球，叩开了月宫的大门。天上的广寒宫，不久即将成为人间的处女地，人们早已闻到吴刚桂花酒的香味了。人类的智慧无限。我们不仅将征服月球，而且将征服火星、金星……，以至整个宇宙。在我们看来只有尚未被认识的事物，没有不可能认识的事物。这是一。
    我们生活在这样幸福的时代，有党的英明领导，保证了科学事业走上为和平为人类造福的康庄大道。党为科学事业的发展创造了一切条件，更有唯一正确的辩证唯物主义世界观作指南。这是二。
    在旧社会，科学为反动统治阶级所垄断。人民的智慧如禁重牢，不能得到充分的发展。今天人民是国家的主人，优越的社会主义制度，强大的祖国，为人民的智慧开辟了无限广阔的用武之地。人人都成了“智多星”，人人都是诸葛亮。为了光辉的共产主义理想，同心同德，互切互磋，还愁何事不成。这是三。
    有此三条，正如“万事俱备，只欠东风”。东风就是我们立大志，下决心，鼓足干劲，刻苦钻研，就一定能迅速赶上世界科学水平。且看只有高小文化程度的中国科学院的转业军人同志们，不是一年就掌握了各种复杂的科学技术吗？有机化学研究所的一组转业军人，经过几个月的钻研，就提出了二十七项技术革新建议，转业军人庄东臣写的工作报告，有些部分超过了刚毕业的大学生。有些转业军人同志决心在二三年内达到实习研究员的水平。多么有革命的志气！当年的华山英雄们，今天又在顽强地攀登另一座新的科学文化的高峰了。（见1月8日中国青年报第一版）
    攀登高峰，前提就是革命的雄心大志。如果在高峰面前，只是像李白当年那样感慨着“噫吁嚱，危乎高哉！”“难于上青天”。那么，要想鼓把劲攀登上去，就不是容易事了。如果也拾级上山，但是浅尝即止，遇到“峰回路转，有亭翼然”之处，就坐下来歇歇，不再想往上走，那么，高峰也就永远变成可望而不可及了。没有立定志向攀上高峰的人，或者在山路上半途而废的人，当然也就享受不到山顶的奇观美景，也就不能说这是一种“力争上游”的风格了。
    “在科学上面是没有平安的大路可走的，只有那在崎岖小路的攀登上不畏劳苦的人，有希望到达光辉的顶点。”（“资本论”第一卷）只要立下雄心，不畏劳苦，不管多高，总会“到达光辉的顶点”的！
