Is it Marxism-Leninism or Private Science?
Li Shu

Marx and Engels criticized certain bourgeois scholars in Germany in the 1870s who attached themselves to the proletariat, saying they were "attempting to reconcile superficial socialist ideas with various theoretical viewpoints that these gentlemen had brought from universities or elsewhere," and that "each of them does not first delve into the new science himself, but strives in one way or another to adapt this new science to the views he brought from the outside, hastily creating his own private science and immediately demanding that this science be taught to others." ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels," two-volume edition, Vol. II, p. 485) Eighty years have passed, but we still do not lack such scholars here. Comrade Shang Yue, a history professor at Renmin University of China, is one of them.

In his article "Solid Research and Adherence to Truth," published in the Beijing Guangming Daily on August 10, 1959, Comrade Shang Yue appeared as a protector of "new things" in historical science and expressed many opinions on academic criticism. In his article "How Should China's Historiography Leap Forward?" published in the Shanghai Wenhui Daily on November 1, 1959, Comrade Shang Yue further emphasized:

	"On certain historical issues, perhaps the majority of historians hold the same view, and this view is even temporarily considered the truth. But when comprehensively examined in connection with the mode of production of each era, or when examined in connection with the preceding and succeeding changes and events in production relations related to this historical issue, this opinion may not be as consistent with the objective laws of science as the views of a few individuals, that is, it may be closer to the truth. ... From here, when we examine history, Marx, Engels, Lenin, and our Comrade Mao Zedong were all in the minority at the beginning of their revolutions, but they had scientific foresight about the budding of future things through the practice of social life. ... This foresight is difficult for us ordinary people to have, but it is not absolutely impossible on certain individual issues. Because some experts, under the long-term education of the Party, have learned to accept the help of the masses, and as long as they conduct solid research on certain individual historical issues, some people are bound to, on this issue or that issue, ... be able to propose a unique understanding that is more in line with scientific laws through the practice of people's social life in history. This understanding may differ from the general view when it is first proposed."

	"In the future, there will inevitably be many 'newly emerging' issues, such as the periodization of ancient and modern history, the sprout of capitalism, and the formation of the Chinese nation, which have been raised in the historical community in recent years. These are issues that the historical community needs to consider and help with the greatest concern and tolerance. These newly emerging issues may not be entirely consistent with the old traditional historiographical system, but they are helpful for a more complete and comprehensive elucidation of the laws of social development in China, which must be considered and resolved."

Generally speaking, we should of course always pay attention to the protection of new things, and we should see that on some issues, the views of a few individuals may be closer to the truth than the majority, and some experts have their unique understanding. However, if we link the above-quoted words with Comrade Shang Yue's own academic views, we cannot but think that this is an urgent call from a creator of private science, and it is issued for a purpose. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to identify what Comrade Shang Yue calls the "closer to the truth" views of a few individuals, the so-called "scientific foresight" of "us ordinary people" on certain issues, the "unique understanding that is more in line with scientific laws" of certain experts on this issue or that issue, and what he opposes as the "views temporarily considered the truth," "general views," and "old traditional historiographical system."

There is no doubt that in our historical science, there is still a struggle between the Marxist-Leninist ideological system and the bourgeois ideological system, and great efforts must be made to eliminate the remaining influence of bourgeois and feudal historical views. But if we say that this reactionary historical view still occupies a dominant and controlling position among our cadres and the masses, that is not in line with the facts. Similarly, if we say that the majority of our historians still regard bourgeois and feudal historical views as the truth and continue to follow the old traditional historiographical system of the bourgeoisie and feudalism, openly suppressing the Marxist-Leninist historical view, making it unacceptable in the field of our historical science, so that Marxist-Leninist historians have to ask them for "tolerance," that is also not in line with the facts. Because if the facts were like this, it would be tantamount to fundamentally negating the profound influence of Marxism-Leninism on our cadres and the masses and in historical science over the past decade and the great victory of the Party on the ideological front. Obviously, the problem does not lie here. The problem lies in the fact that Comrade Shang Yue's so-called "views temporarily considered the truth" and "general views" actually refer to the Marxist-Leninist view of Chinese history, his so-called "old traditional historiographical system" actually refers to the Marxist-Leninist historiographical system, and his so-called "views that are more in line with the objective laws of science" and "unique understanding that is more in line with scientific laws" of a few individuals, etc., are actually his private science. Comrade Shang Yue had already publicly promoted this private science in the preface to his book "Research on the Socio-Economic Formations of the Ming and Qing Dynasties," published in March 1957 at the latest. His recently published articles merely indicate that he still adheres to the following views mentioned in this preface:

	"The discussion on the social nature of the Ming and Qing dynasties is a major issue in Chinese history. The resolution of this issue will not only affect the historical community's certain traditional views on Chinese history, such as the long-term and stagnant nature of Chinese feudal society, and even that the social basis of Chinese society until the invasion of foreign capitalism after 1840 was still the natural economy combining small-scale agriculture and household handicraft industry, etc., but will also affect the question of what period should be taken as the starting point of modern Chinese history." The reason why Comrade Shang Yue calls the views on Chinese history listed in this passage "traditional views" or "old traditional historiographical system" is that these views are found either in the works of Marx and Engels, the works of Lenin, or the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, have long been accepted by the majority of our historians, and have become part of the general historical knowledge. Marx and Engels believed that in India and China, the broad foundation of the mode of production was formed by the unity of small-scale agriculture and household handicraft industry. The internal solidity and structure of this mode of production was an obstacle to the disintegrating effect of commerce after the Opium War. In India, the British destroyed this small economic community with their power as rulers and landowners, but the disintegration of this community was still extremely slow. "In China, the degree is even smaller because no direct political power has joined in to help." ("Capital," Vol. III, p. 413) While pointing out that there was already a "free bourgeoisie alongside the peasants" in China, Lenin believed that the agricultural lifestyle and natural economy occupied a dominant position in China's socio-economy. ("Collected Works of Lenin," Vol. XVIII, p. 154) Comrade Mao Zedong's views on Chinese history presented in his many works are a scientific system. In "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," Comrade Mao Zedong believed that "since China broke away from the slave system and entered the feudal system, its economic, political, and cultural development has long been trapped in a state of slow development. This feudal system has continued for about three thousand years since the Zhou and Qin dynasties." And said: "The extreme poverty and backwardness of the peasants caused by such cruel exploitation and oppression by the landlord class is the basic reason for the stagnation of Chinese society in economic and social life for thousands of years." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol. II, pp. 618-619) Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that "since the Opium War of 1840, China has step by step become a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society." During this period, "the self-sufficient natural economic foundation of the feudal era was destroyed; however, the foundation of the feudal exploitation system—the exploitation of the peasants by the landlord class—not only remained, but also combined with the exploitation of comprador capital and usury capital, occupying an obvious advantage in China's socio-economic life." (Ibid., p. 624) Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his many works that the history of imperialism's invasion of China and its combination with China's feudal forces to enslave the Chinese people is the history of modern China. Therefore, the nature of the modern Chinese revolution is bourgeois democratic, and its task lies in opposing imperialism and feudalism.

Comrade Mao Zedong's analysis and stipulations on these issues in his works have long become classics and a solid base of Marxism-Leninism that even the enemies of the Chinese revolution dare not attack. Here, the task of our historians should be to use rich factual materials to elucidate Comrade Mao Zedong's system, and starting from here, following Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, continue to expand the occupation of Marxism-Leninism in the field of Chinese history. But Comrade Shang Yue is not doing this. Disregarding the true face of history, he is dedicated to opposing the most basic views of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Comrade Mao Zedong on Chinese history. In the preface quoted earlier, Comrade Shang Yue claimed that in his research process, he discovered that the development of the sprouts of capitalism in the Zhengde and Jiajing years (1506-1566) of the mid-Ming Dynasty, that is, the early 16th century, had already caused significant changes in the superstructure; "after the mid-16th century, it gradually developed into a relatively powerful social force." Therefore, Comrade Shang Yue believes:

	"Since the middle of the Ming Dynasty, Chinese feudal society has been a feudal society in the process of disintegration, no longer a 'complete feudal society' or 'unchanged feudal society' as a whole natural economy. That is to say, feudal relations of production have gradually become a serious obstacle to the development of social productive forces, and the feudal system has increasingly become something to be overthrown."

Although Comrade Shang Yue said that capitalism at that time "had not yet developed into a decisive social force, so it failed to change the fundamental nature of Chinese society," he believes that the discussion on the social nature of the Ming and Qing dynasties "will affect the question of what period should be taken as the starting point of modern Chinese history." That is to say, if a large amount of material appears in the discussion, enough to prove that capitalism after 1566 has broken away from the embryonic state and become a "decisive social force," changing the fundamental nature of Chinese society, then modern China no longer refers to the semi-colonial and semi-feudal era stipulated by Comrade Mao Zedong based on his scientific analysis, but refers to an independent capitalist era. The beginning of this era should be pushed up 274 years from 1840, 223 years earlier than a sign of the division of the European capitalist era—the French Revolution (1789), and 82 years earlier than another sign—the English Revolution (1648). The logical conclusion drawn from this is that the long-term nature of Chinese feudal society has disappeared (Comrade Shang Yue is a proponent of the so-called "Wei and Jin feudalism theory." According to this theory, Chinese feudal society began in the Wei and Jin dynasties, and its characteristic changed from "long-term" to "short-term"); the natural economy began to disintegrate as early as more than 270 years before the Opium War, and of course no longer existed after the Opium War. All the basic views of Marxist classic writers who used to be the basis for analyzing the nature of Chinese society on the history of modern China, even those that have been proven by the practice of the Chinese revolution, need to be reconsidered, some need to add new and very far-fetched explanations, and some need to be overthrown. This system, which is hostile to Comrade Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist system of Chinese history, is the "new thing" in historical science, the "view closer to the truth," the "scientific foresight" and "unique understanding" on certain individual issues that Comrade Shang Yue has so vaguely and arrogantly recommended to us in his recently published articles.

The most fundamental fallacy of this system lies in its requirement to completely transform Chinese history according to the appearance of Western social history. In order to achieve this goal, Comrade Shang Yue exhausted the means of distorting historical records and Marxist-Leninist classics, and described the Chinese bourgeoisie and proletariat as classes that had already existed. This method of trying to make historical development obey imagination is completely subjective. The Chinese nation is a nation with a great history, and the sprouts of capitalism have been bred in the commodity production of the long centuries, and it would have developed along its own path without the influence of foreign capital. However, due to the rapid development of European countries and the slow development of China, by the middle of the 19th century, these countries fought in according to the capitalist law of the jungle, affecting a turning point in Chinese history and forming a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. This change makes the era after the mid-19th century have a characteristic, that is, the occurrence of all problems is inseparable from the aggression of foreign capital. The emergence and development of the Chinese bourgeoisie, the nature of Chinese society and revolutionary tasks, must all be linked to this change and recognized as completely new issues different from any era in the past, in order to obtain correct solutions. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The Chinese bourgeoisie and proletariat, as two special social classes, are newly produced, and they are classes that have never existed in Chinese history." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol. II, p. 621) This is an important factor that distinguishes modern Chinese society from the past. The Chinese bourgeoisie has both revolutionary and compromising characteristics because they are newly produced and stamped with the imprint of semi-colonialism and semi-feudalism. If they were very old, history would not have been what it is now. They would have had conflicts of interest with foreign capital in the Opium War and risen up to lead the national and democratic revolution. But they did not. Because they did not exist yet. Comrade Shang Yue often uses a large amount of textual research to describe that the people of the urban class have both national thoughts and democratic thoughts, and any event as long as they participate in it, can reflect various bourgeois characteristics. But where was their patriotism during the Opium War? The facts show that they have no patriotism at all. They not only have no patriotism, but also actively colluded with the invaders to make money by exchanging silver and tea silk for opium. Therefore, whether in Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, or Jiangsu, they were called traitors. In 1842, when British warships reached Nanjing, the first to come out to sue for peace were the salt merchants of Yangzhou. There are many such things, which are all contrary to Comrade Shang Yue's point of view. Actually, it is not surprising. China's national capital needs a process of accumulation. This process is developed along with the destruction of China's feudal economy by foreign capital, not started four hundred years ago. The national and democratic thoughts of the Chinese bourgeoisie also began to become clear when they withdrew their funds from foreign banks and established industries. The study of Chinese socio-economic history is of great significance, but concrete analysis must be carried out, and materialism cannot be vulgarized. The path taken by Comrade Shang Yue in his research work is fundamentally impassable. First, he wants to prove that China has long been a capitalist society, this road does not work, the Trotskyites are an example. The Trotskyites were already using nonsense such as "China has long been a capitalist society because the sale of land is free and feudal forces no longer exist" as a basis thirty years ago to promote that China was already a capitalist society and advocated calling for "overthrowing capitalism" and "implementing socialist revolution" at that time. This kind of "doctrine" could not be established thirty years ago, and it still cannot be established now after changing its face; it was anti-Marxist thirty years ago, and it is still anti-Marxist now after changing its face. Second, he wants to use the existence of handicrafts workshops and the urban class to directly explain the changes in Chinese philosophical thought and other superstructures far from the economic base in the Ming and Qing dynasties, completely ignoring that the reflection of these superstructures on the base is tortuous. This vulgar method of labeling has nothing in common with the Marxist method. For example, regarding some scholars who had rebellious ideas against the Manchu rule in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties as representatives of capitalist relations and labeling them with the label of handicraft industry is not a method of concrete analysis of concrete problems. This road does not work, the book "The Defense of Capitalism by Western European Philosophy" written by the Russian social democrat Shulyatikov is an example. Shulyatikov attempted to explain the philosophical system with the handicraft industry system, believing that the philosophical thoughts of Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Hegel, etc., were all derived from the organizational functions of the handicraft workshop owners. Lenin added many "nonsense," "rubbish," and "really nonsense" comments to his book and said: "The entire book is an example of unscrupulous vulgarization of materialism. It does not make concrete analysis of various periods, social formations, and ideological systems, but only talks about the empty words of 'organizers,' and only makes far-fetched and ridiculous comparisons." (Complete Works of Lenin, Vol. 38, p. 564) There is no doubt that these lessons are worth remembering.

Comrade Mao Zedong's analysis of Chinese society is a complete scientific system. This scientific system has been confirmed by countless vivid facts, and it is the foundation of the entire strategic line of the Chinese Communist Party leading the Chinese revolution. However, Comrade Shang Yue calls this scientific system a "traditional view" or "old traditional historiographical system" and opposes it, thereby replacing it with an anti-Marxist private scientific system that does not conform to historical reality. This is not "closer to the truth," but far from the truth, and delving into the dead end.

The errors of Comrade Shang Yue's private scientific system make us deeply feel the importance of putting politics in command in historical science work. Marxist-Leninist historical science is a scientific of Party spirit, which requires scientific workers to first study Marxist-Leninist and Comrade Mao Zedong's works in their work, and with an attitude faithful to this science, firmly stand on the position of the Party and the working class, and serve the socialist cause, instead of reconciling the various different theoretical viewpoints they brought from the outside with Marxism-Leninism to create their own private science. Marx believed that the entire value of his theory lies in the fact that this theory is "essentially critical and revolutionary." Lenin pointed out that the irresistible attraction of Marxist theory to socialists in various countries lies in the inherent combination of strict and highly scientific and revolutionary nature. Our historical science must maintain this quality inherent in Marxist theory and aim the critical edge at the enemies of Marxism. Scientific and creative nature are indispensable to all scientific work. However, scientific and creative nature can only be correctly brought into play on the basis of being faithful to Marxism and thoroughly understanding it. If we deviate from this foundation and use Marxist rhetoric as a means to protect private science, we will inevitably distort the truth and embark on the road of being used by the bourgeoisie, and therefore there will be no talk of scientific and creative nature. Comrade Shang Yue's embarkation on the wrong path of private science is a vivid example.

Academic issues can be freely discussed, this is the Party's policy. But Comrade Shang Yue's article shows that he does not welcome discussion, but is trying to oppose discussion, and even involves other academic issues that are actually often encouraged and still under discussion, demanding that "the historical community consider and help with the greatest concern and tolerance." It is as if someone criticizing his private science in the discussion is not caring and tolerant. This is an incorrect attitude. It should be said that the issues raised by Comrade Shang Yue involve the direction of historical science work, the question of serving whom, and the question of Marxism-Leninism or private science. For such issues, people should care, and should consider and help, that is to say, should participate in the discussion and use the weapon of criticism to completely resolve it.

    是马克思列宁主义还是私人科学？
    黎澍
    马克思和恩格斯批评十九世纪七十年代德国的某些归附于无产阶级的资产阶级学者“企图把领会得很肤浅的社会主义思想跟这些先生们从大学或别处搬来的各种不同理论观点调和起来”，并且说，他们“每个人不是首先自己钻研新的科学，而是力求这样或那样使这新的科学适合自己从外部带来的观点，匆促地给自己造出自己私人的科学并且立即要求把这一科学教给别人。”（“马恩文选”两卷集，第二卷，485页）时间过了八十年，可是在我们这里依旧不缺乏这样的学者。中国人民大学历史教授尚钺同志就是其中的一人。
    在1959年8月10日北京光明日报发表的“踏实钻研与坚持真理”一文中，尚钺同志俨然以历史科学中的“新事物”的保护者自居，发表了许多关于学术批评的意见。在1959年11月1日上海文汇报发表的“中国史学工作应如何跃进？”一文中，尚钺同志又强调说：
      “在某些历史问题上，也许史学界有多数人持一种相同的看法，从而这种看法甚至被暂时认为是真理。但在与各该时代现实的生产方式联系起来作全面考察时，或在与这种历史问题的先行的与后继的生产关系变化和事变连系起来考察时，这种意见也许不如个别人或少数人的看法更符合于科学的客观规律，就是说，可能更接近于真理。……从这里，我们检查一下历史，马克思、恩格斯、列宁和我们的毛泽东同志，在其革命之初，都是少数，不过，他们通过社会生活实践对未来事物萌芽有着科学的预见。……这个预见是我们一般人很难有的，但也不是在某些个别问题上绝对没有的。因为某些专家在党的长期教育下，学会了接受群众的帮助，对某些个别历史问题只要踏踏实实地进行研究，就必然有些人对于这一问题或那一问题，……就可能透过历史上人民群众社会生活的实践，提出比较符合科学规律的独到认识。这个认识在最初提出时，可能与一般看法不同。”
    “将来还必然有许多‘新冒出来’的问题，如近年来史学界提出的古代史和近代史分期问题、资本主义萌芽及中国民族形成问题之类。这是需要史学界以最大的关怀、宽容来考虑和帮助的。这些新冒出来的问题，可能与旧的传统史学体系不尽符合，但是却有助于更完满、更全面地阐明中国社会发展规律时所必须予以考虑和解决的。”
    一般说，我们当然应当经常注意新事物的保护，并且应当看到，在有些问题上，个别人或少数人的看法可能比多数人更接近于真理，某些专家有他们的独到认识。但是如果把上面所引的这些话同尚钺同志本人的学术观点连系起来看，我们就不能不认为这是私人科学制造者的迫切的呼声，是有所为而发的。因此，识别尚钺同志所谓个别人或少数人的“更接近于真理”的看法，所谓“我们一般人”在某些问题上的“科学预见”，所谓某些专家对于这一问题或那一问题的“比较符合于科学规律的独到认识”到底是什么，以及为他所反对的“被暂时认为是真理”的看法，“一般看法”，“旧的传统史学体系”到底是什么，是完全必要的。
    毫无疑问，在我国历史科学中至今还存在马克思列宁主义思想体系和资产阶级思想体系的斗争，要肃清资产阶级和封建主义历史观的残余影响还必须作很大的努力。但是如果说，在我们的干部和群众中，这种反动历史观仍旧占有统治的和支配的地位，那就不符合事实。同样，如果说，在我国历史家里面，多数人直到现在还把资产阶级和封建主义历史观看作真理，并且继续遵循资产阶级和封建主义的旧的传统史学体系，公开压制马克思列宁主义的历史观，使之不能见容于我国历史科学领域，以至马克思列宁主义的历史家要向他们请求“宽容”，也不符合事实。因为如果事实是这样，那就等于从根本上否定了十年来马克思列宁主义在我国干部和群众中和历史科学中的深刻的影响和党在思想战线上的伟大的胜利。可见问题不在这里。问题在于尚钺同志所谓“被暂时认为是真理”的看法和“一般看法”实际上是指马克思列宁主义对中国历史的看法，所谓“旧的传统史学体系”实际上是指马克思列宁主义的史学体系，而他的所谓个别人或少数人的“更符合于科学的客观规律的看法”，“比较符合于科学规律的独到认识”等等，实际上是他的私人科学。关于这个私人科学，尚钺同志至迟在1957年3月出版的“明清社会经济形态的研究”一书的序言中就已经公开宣传过了。最近发表的文章无非表明他仍旧坚持他在这篇序言中所提到的这样一些观点：
    “关于明清两代社会性质的讨论，是中国历史上的一个大问题。这个问题的解决，不仅将影响到史学界对中国历史的某些传统看法，如中国封建社会长期性和停滞论，乃至中国社会直到1840年外国资本主义侵入以后，中国社会基础还是小农业与家庭手工业相结合的自然经济等等，而且也将影响到中国近代史究竟以什么时期作为起点的问题”。在这段话里面列举出来的对中国历史的看法之所以被尚钺同志称为“传统看法”或“旧的传统史学体系”，就是因为这些看法不是见之于马克思和恩格斯的著作，列宁的著作，就是见之于毛泽东同志的著作，早为我国多数历史家所接受，并且已经成为一般人的历史知识的一部分。马克思和恩格斯认为，在印度和中国，生产方式的广阔基础是由小农业和家庭手工业的统一形成的。这个生产方式的内部坚固性和结构，在鸦片战争以后，对于商业的分解作用，是一种障碍。在印度，英国人以他们的作为统治者和土地所有者的权力来破坏这种小的经济共同体，但是这个共同体的分解还是极其缓慢的。“在中国，因为没有直接的政治权力加进来帮助，所以程度还是更小。”（“资本论”第三卷，413页）列宁在指出中国“农民旁边已有一个自由资产阶级”的同时，认为在中国社会经济中农业生活方式和自然经济占统治地位。（“列宁全集”十八卷，154页）毛泽东同志在他的许多著作中提出的对于中国历史的观点则是一个科学体系。在“中国革命和中国共产党”一书中，毛泽东同志认为“中国自从脱离奴隶制度进到封建制度以后，其经济、政治、文化的发展，就长期地陷在发展迟缓的状态中。这个封建制度，自周秦以来一直延续了三千年左右。”并且说：“地主阶级这样残酷的剥削和压迫所造成的农民的极端的穷苦和落后，就是中国社会几千年在经济上和社会生活上停滞不前的基本原因。”（毛泽东选集，第二卷，618—619页）毛泽东同志指出，“自从一八四零年的鸦片战争以后，中国一步一步地变成了一个半殖民地半封建的社会。”在这个时期，“封建时代的自给自足的自然经济基础是被破坏了；但是，封建剥削制度的根基——地主阶级对农民的剥削，不但依旧保持着，而且同买办资本和高利贷资本的剥削结合在一起，在中国的社会经济生活中，占着显然的优势。”（同上书，624页）毛泽东同志在他的许多著作中指出，帝国主义侵入中国并同中国的封建势力结合起来奴役中国人民的历史，就是中国的近代史。所以近代中国革命的性质是资产阶级民主主义的，它的任务在于反对帝国主义和封建主义。
    毛泽东同志在他的著作中对于这些问题所作的分析和规定早已成为经典，成为连中国革命的敌人都不敢攻击的马克思列宁主义的坚固的阵地。在这里，我们的历史家的任务应当是用丰富的事实材料来阐明毛泽东同志的体系，并且从这里出发，遵循毛泽东同志的指示，继续在中国历史领域中扩大马克思列宁主义的占领。可是尚钺同志不是这样做。他不顾历史的真实面目，致力于反对马克思、恩格斯、列宁和毛泽东同志对于中国历史的各个最基本的观点。在前面所引的序言中，尚钺同志自称他在研究过程中发现明朝中叶正德、嘉靖年间（1506—1566），即十六世纪前期，资本主义萌芽的发展已经引起上层建筑的显著的变化；“到十六世纪中叶以后，渐渐发展成比较有力的社会势力”。因此，尚钺同志认为：
        “自明代中叶以后，中国封建社会已经是解体过程中的封建社会，不再是什么自然经济整体的‘完整的封建社会’，或‘原封未动的封建社会’。就是说，封建的生产关系已经逐渐变成了社会生产力发展的严重障碍，封建制度已经愈益成为要被推翻的东西了”。
    尽管尚钺同志说，当时资本主义“还未发展成决定的社会势力，所以它还未能改变中国社会的根本性质”，但是他认为关于明清两代社会性质的讨论“将影响到中国近代史究竟以什么时期为起点的问题”。这就是说，在讨论中如果出现大量的材料，足以证明资本主义在1566年以后已经脱离萌芽状态，成为“决定的社会势力”，改变了中国社会的根本性质，那么，中国的近代就不再是指毛泽东同志依据他的科学分析而规定的半殖民地半封建时代，而是指一个独立的资本主义时代。这个时代的开始要从1840年上推二百七十四年，比划分欧洲资本主义时代的一个标志——法国革命（1789年）早二百二十三年，比另一个标志——英国革命（1648年）早八十二年。由此得到的逻辑的结论是，中国的封建社会的长期性消失了（尚钺同志是所谓“魏晋封建论”的主张者，按照这个学说，中国封建社会始于魏晋，它的特点便由“长期性”一变而为“短期性”了）；自然经济早在鸦片战争二百七十多年前已经开始解体，在鸦片战争以后当然也不存在了。所有作为分析中国社会性质的依据的马克思主义经典作家对于近代中国历史的基本观点，那怕是已经为中国革命的实践所证明了的，都需要重新考虑，有的要增加新的非常牵强的解释，有的要推翻。这个与毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义的中国历史体系相敌对的体系就是尚钺同志在最近发表的文章里面如此闪烁其词和如此傲慢地向我们推荐的那个历史科学中的“新事物”、“更接近于真理的看法”、某些个别问题上的“科学预见”和“独到认识”。
    这个体系的一个最根本的谬误就在它要求完全按照西方社会历史的样子来改造中国历史。为了达到这个目的，尚钺同志用尽了曲解历史记载和马克思列宁主义经典著作的手段，把中国资产阶级和无产阶级描写为早已存在的阶级。这种企图使历史发展服从于臆想的方法完全是主观主义的。中国民族是有伟大历史的民族，在漫长世纪的商品生产中已经孕育着资本主义的萌芽，没有外国资本的影响，也会循着自己的道路发展起来。但是由于欧洲国家发展迅速，中国发展缓慢，到十九世纪中叶，这些国家按照资本主义弱肉强食的规律打了进来，影响中国历史发生转折，形成一个半殖民地半封建社会。这个变化使得十九世纪中叶以后的时代带有一个特征，就是一切问题的发生都同外国资本的侵略分不开。中国资产阶级的发生和发展，中国社会性质和革命任务，都必须同这个变化联系起来，当作不同于过去任何时代的完全新的问题来认识，才能得到正确的解决。毛泽东同志说：“中国的资产阶级和无产阶级，作为两个特殊的社会阶级来看，它们是新产生的，它们是中国历史上没有过的阶级”。（毛泽东选集，卷二，621页）这是近代中国社会和过去不同的重要因素。中国资产阶级既有革命性，又有妥协性，就因为他们是新产生的，打上了半殖民地半封建的烙印。如果他们资格老得很，历史就不是后来那个样子。他们会在鸦片战争中同外国资本发生利益冲突，起来领导民族和民主革命。可是没有。因为他们还不存在。尚钺同志常常用大量的考证来描写市民阶级的人既有民族思想，又有民主思想，任何事件只要有他们参加，就可以反映出各种资产阶级的特点来。然而在鸦片战争时期，他们的爱国心在何处？事实表明他们一点爱国心都没有。他们不但没有爱国心，而且积极同侵略者勾结起来，用白银和茶丝换鸦片赚钱。所以无论在广东、福建、浙江、江苏，他们都被称为汉奸。1842年，英国兵船打到南京，首先出来求和的是扬州的盐商。这种事情多得很，都是同尚钺同志的观点正相反对的。实际上并不奇怪。中国的民族资本要有一个积累的过程。这个过程是伴随外国资本对中国的封建经济的破坏而发展的，不是在四百年前就开始了的。中国资产阶级的民族思想和民主思想也是在他们把存放在外国洋行的资金抽出来办工业的时候，才开始明确起来。中国社会经济史的研究具有重要的意义，但是必须进行具体分析，不能把唯物主义庸俗化。尚钺同志在研究工作中所走的道路是根本走不通的。第一，他想证明中国早就是资本主义社会，此路不通，托洛茨基分子就是例子。托洛茨基分子在三十年前就已经在用“中国因为土地买卖自由，封建势力早已不存在了”一类的胡说做根据，宣传中国早已是资本主义社会，主张在当时号召“打倒资本主义”和“实行社会主义革命”。这种“学说”在三十年前不能成立，现在改头换面还是不能成立；在三十年前是反马克思主义的，现在改头换面也还是反马克思主义的。第二，他想用手工工场和市民阶级的存在来直接说明明清之际的中国哲学思想和其他远离经济基础的上层建筑的变化，根本忽视这些上层建筑对于基础的反映是曲折的。这种庸俗的贴标签的方法和马克思主义方法毫无共同之处。例如把明末清初一些对满族统治有反抗思想的学者都看作是资本主义关系的代表，贴上工场手工业的标签，这就不是对具体问题进行具体分析的方法了。此路不通，俄国社会民主党人舒里齐亚科夫所著“西欧哲学对资本主义的辩护”一书就是榜样。舒里齐亚科夫企图用手工业制度来说明哲学体系，认为笛卡儿、斯宾诺莎、莱布尼茨、黑格尔等的哲学思想都是从手工工场主的组织者的职能中引伸出来的。列宁在他的书上加了许多“胡说”、“废话”、“真是胡说”的批语，并且说：“整个这本书就是把唯物主义肆无忌惮地庸俗化的榜样。它对各个时期、社会形态、思想体系不作具体的分析，只讲关于‘组织者’的空话，只做牵强附会、荒唐可笑的对比。”（列宁全集38卷，564页）毫无疑问，这些教训是值得记取的。
    毛泽东同志对于中国社会的分析是一个完整的科学体系。这个科学体系已经被无数生动的事实所证实，它是中国共产党领导中国革命的全部策略路线的基础。而尚钺同志却把这个科学体系叫做“传统看法”或“旧的传统史学体系”，加以反对，从而代之以不符合历史实际的反马克思主义的私人科学体系，这就不是“更接近于真理”，而是远离真理，钻进牛角尖里面去了。
    尚钺同志的私人科学体系的错误，使我们深深感到政治挂帅在历史科学工作中的重要性。马克思列宁主义的历史科学是党性的科学，它要求科学工作者在自己的工作中首先钻研马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志的著作，并且以忠实于这个科学的态度，坚定地站到党和工人阶级的立场上来，为社会主义事业服务，而不是把他们从外部搬来的各种不同的理论观点同马克思列宁主义调和起来，造出自己的私人科学。马克思认为他的理论的全部价值在于这个理论“在本质上是批判的和革命的”。列宁指出，马克思主义理论对于世界各国社会主义者之所以具有不可遏止的吸引力，就在于它本身是严格的和高度的科学性和革命性的内在的结合。我们的历史科学必须保持马克思主义理论所固有的这个品质，把批判的锋芒对准马克思主义的敌人。科学性和创造性是一切科学工作所不可缺少的。但是科学性和创造性只有在忠实于马克思主义并且透彻了解它的基础上，才能正确地发挥出来。如果离开这个基础，把马克思主义词句当作保护私人科学的手段，就势必会要歪曲真理，走上为资产阶级所利用的道路上去，因而也就谈不到什么科学性和创造性。尚钺同志走上私人科学的歧途，就是一个活生生的例子。
    学术问题可以自由讨论，这是党的政策。但是尚钺同志的文章表明他不是欢迎讨论，而是极力反对讨论，甚至把其他实际上是经常受到鼓励的还在讨论中的学术问题牵连在一起，要求“史学界以最大的关怀、宽容来考虑和帮助”。仿佛有人在讨论中对他的私人科学提出批评，就是不关怀，不宽容。这是一种不正确的态度。应当说，尚钺同志提出的问题涉及历史科学工作的方向问题，为谁服务的问题，是马克思列宁主义还是私人科学的问题。对于这样的问题，人们应当关怀，并且应当考虑和帮助，也就是说，应当参加讨论，用批判的武器使它得到彻底的解决。
