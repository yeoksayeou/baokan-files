    Dongting Lake Spring Fishing Sets Record
    Eight Lakeside Counties Jointly Harvest 100,000 Dan of Fresh Fish
    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha: Eight counties bordering Dongting Lake mobilized 30,000 fishing boats to carry out an unprecedented joint large-scale fishing campaign. From the beginning of January to the present, they have caught more than 100,000 dan of fresh fish, creating the highest record for spring fishing in Dongting Lake in previous years, equivalent to a quarter of the total fish catch last year.
    The fishermen of Dongting Lake provide a large amount of fresh fish every year to supply the people in various urban and rural areas and support national construction. Before the people's communes, due to the small scope of the fishery cooperatives and dispersed manpower, fishing was only carried out in smaller lakes or places where fish gathered, and fishing could not be carried out in the larger lakes and outer lakes. After the people's communes, due to abundant funds, many large-scale fishing tools were added, and measures such as one boat with multiple tools were adopted, so the fishing efficiency was greatly improved, and last year's fish production exceeded any previous year. This year, the CPC Changde Prefectural Committee convened a fishery cooperation conference of eight counties in the lake area and proposed a joint fishing plan for the eight counties. This call was warmly supported by the people around the lake. After the fishermen of Yuanjiang and five other counties launched a joint fishing campaign in Wanzi Lake on the 3rd, the daily catch was more than 20,000 jin, and the fish caught were all large fish weighing more than ten jin to dozens of jin.

    洞庭湖春季捕鱼创纪录
    滨湖八县联合捕捞鲜鱼十万担
    据新华社长沙讯　洞庭湖滨八个县出动三万只渔船，开展了史无前例的联合大捕大捞运动。从元月开始到现在，已捕鲜鱼十万多担，创造了洞庭湖历年春季捕鱼的最高纪录，等于去年全年捕鱼量的四分之一。
    洞庭湖滨的渔民们每年都提供大量的鲜鱼供应各地城乡人民食用，支援国家建设。人民公社化以前，由于渔业合作社范围小，人力分散，只在较小的湖泊或鱼群集中的地方捕捞，不能在大湖和外湖捕鱼。人民公社化以后，由于资金雄厚，添办了很多大型捕鱼工具，并采取了一船多工具等措施，因而捕捞效率大大提高，去年的鱼产量超过了以往任何一年。今年，中共常德地委召开了湖区八县的水产协作会议，提出八县联合捕鱼的计划。这一号召得到滨湖人民的热烈拥护。沅江等五个县渔民从3日起在万子湖揭开联合捕捞的序幕后，每天捕捞量都在二万斤以上，而且捕捞的都是十斤以上到几十斤的大鱼。
