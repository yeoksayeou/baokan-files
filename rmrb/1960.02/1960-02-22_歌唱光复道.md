Singing the Song of Guangfu Road

	Sales staff are spirited and strong,
	Supporting production with firm resolve.
	Braving wind and snow to deliver goods,
	Delicious food loaded on the cart.
	Fragrant in the mouth, warm in the heart,
	Infusing us with new strength.
	Bringing zeal to the factory floor,
	Production enthusiasm burns like fire.
		Tianjin Steel Rolling Mill No. 6

	The store works well with us,
	Delivering goods to the workshop at night.
	A full range of non-staple foods, good quality,
	Improving our meals, making the food fresh.
	Improved living gives us more energy,
	Determined to fight the great battle of 1960.
	Thanks to the Party's good leadership,
	We will double production again!

    歌唱光复道
    售货人员精神强
    支援生产志气刚
    不避风雪来送货
    美味食品车上装
    香在嘴里暖在心
    浑身增加新力量
    带着干劲进厂房
    生产热情火一样
      天津轧钢六厂
            一车间职工
    商店协作搞得欢
    夜里送货来车间
    副食齐全质量好
    改善伙食饭菜鲜
    生活改善劲更猛
    决心大战六零年
    感谢党的好领导
    再把生产翻一番
    天津天虹电器厂
            一车间职工
