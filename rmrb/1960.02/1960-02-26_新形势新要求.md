    New Situation, New Requirements
    Jing Yu
    This newspaper published an editorial on February 22nd, entitled: Supply Agricultural Production Materials Faster and Better. The article, in light of the new situation of this year’s spring plowing and spring sowing, put forward new requirements for the commercial sector.
    Before this editorial was published, the mass movement on the national commercial front was in a high tide, and touching deeds in support of spring plowing were pouring in. Today, we are also pleased to see that Pingxiang County in Jiangxi Province has raised the red flag of the commercial front supporting spring plowing and production, vigorously supplying agricultural production materials, not only meeting the needs of production in terms of quantity and variety, but also making due efforts in technical guidance. This has powerfully promoted the rapid development of spring plowing and production.
    In the continuous two years of the Great Leap Forward, commercial work in various places has gained many new experiences in supporting industrial and agricultural production and promoting industrial and agricultural production. The commercial sector has thousands of connections with the national economy. It has close ties with both production and consumption; it has close ties with both the industrial and agricultural sectors. Precisely because of this, any problems and opinions from various departments will quickly be reflected by the commercial sector. In the preparation for spring plowing and production, the reflection of many people's communes in Pingxiang on the county's commercial work is: "The supply of production materials is early and good, and it is very convenient to carry out production. The commercial department's work is really excellent." What does this reflection illustrate? First, it clearly shows that commerce is responsible for the task of commodity circulation and supply, and it and production are two different types of fields. Therefore, from the function of supply and circulation, it must be early and good. Second, it shows that circulation and production are also mutually dependent and mutually promoting. If the circulation and supply of production materials are done well, production can develop smoothly. If production develops, the work of circulation and supply can continue. Third, commercial work starts from production, does a good job in supply, and ultimately develops production. This is the "excellent" commercial sector. Therefore, to assess the achievements of commercial work, according to the opinions of the people's communes in Pingxiang, is to see whether the commercial department's work "is convenient or not for production."
    As early as the Anti-Japanese War period, when Comrade Mao Zedong talked about economic and financial work, he clearly stipulated that developing production and ensuring supply are our working principles. At that time, he proposed that financial and trade personnel should use 90% of their efforts to support and promote production, and 10% of their efforts to generate income. This instruction is not only applicable to the Anti-Japanese War period, but also to the socialist construction period. Circulation is determined by production, but circulation also has a reverse effect on production. This is the materialist dialectical view of Marxism-Leninism. Leaving production, there is no circulation to speak of; without circulation, it will also affect the development of production.
    At present, China's agricultural production is in a period of rapid development, and large-scale agricultural technical transformation is also beginning; this has brought about new changes in the production and supply work of the commercial sector. It is not only necessary to supply sickles and hoes, but also tractors, towed farm implements, and improved farm implements; it is not only necessary to supply main engines, but also shafts, ball bearings, and parts of all sizes. For commercial workers, it is not enough to simply understand a little bit of business and economic trends, but also to understand their performance and structural principles when supplying these machines, to understand the basic skills of using and repairing them, and to provide technical support to the countryside. The objective situation of socialist construction and development requires that socialist commercial work cannot mechanically stay within the scope of purchase, sale, storage, transfer, and profit, but must actively serve production and promote the development of production.
    The commercial work of Pingxiang County has the above characteristics, and deserves to be a red flag in Jiangxi Province.

    新形势新要求
    静宇
    本报2月22日发表了一篇社论，题目是：更快更好地供应农业生产资料。文章针对着今年春耕春播的新的形势，向商业部门提出了新的要求。
    这篇社论发表以前，全国商业战线的群众运动正处在一个高涨的形势中，支援春耕的感人事迹纷至沓来。今天我们又高兴地看到了江西省的萍乡县高举起商业战线支援春耕生产的红旗，大力供应农业生产资料，不仅在数量上品种上满足了生产的需要，而且在技术指导上也作了应有的努力。这就有力地推动了春耕生产的迅速开展。
    在连续两年的大跃进中，各地商业工作在支援工农业生产和促进工农业生产方面取得了许多新的经验。商业部门和国民经济有着千丝万缕的联系，它既和生产有密切的联系，又同消费有密切的联系；既和工业部门有着密切的联系，又同农业部门有密切的联系。正因为如此，各个部门一有问题和意见，很快就会从商业部门反映出来。在春耕生产的准备工作中，萍乡许多人民公社对这个县的商业工作的反映是：“生产资料供应又早又好，搞起生产来非常顺手，商业部门工作真呱呱叫”，这个反映说明什么问题呢？第一、它清楚地说明了商业是担负商品流通供应任务的，它同生产是两个不同性质的领域，因此，从供应流通的职能来说，必须又早又好。第二、它说明流通和生产也是互相依存、相互促进的，生产资料的流通供应搞好了，生产才能顺利发展。生产发展了，流通供应的工作才能继续下去。第三、商业工作从生产出发，做好供应，归根到底，发展生产。这就是“呱呱叫”的商业部门了。因此，考核商业工作的成绩，按萍乡人民公社的意见就是看商业部门的工作“对生产顺手不顺手”。
    早在抗日战争时期，毛泽东同志谈到经济工作和财政工作的时候，明确规定发展生产，保障供应是我们的工作方针。当时，他提出财贸工作人员要用90％的力量支援和促进生产，用10％的力量搞收入。这个指示，不仅适用于抗日战争时期，而且也适用于社会主义建设时期。流通决定于生产，但流通也要反作用于生产，这是马克思列宁主义的唯物辩证观点。离开生产，也就谈不上有什么流通；没有流通，也会影响到生产的发展。
    目前，我国的农业生产正处在一个迅速发展的时期，大规模的农业技术改造工作也正在开始；这就使商业部门的生产供应工作发生了新的变化。不仅仅要供应镰刀、锄头，而且要供应拖拉机、拖带农具、改良农具；不仅是要供应主机，而且要供应轴杠、滚珠、大小配件。对于商业工作人员来说，这就不是简单地懂点业务、经济行情就行了，而是还要在供应这些机械的时候，懂得它们的性能和构造原理，懂得起码的使用技能和修理技能，给农村以技术支援。社会主义建设发展的客观形势，要求社会主义的商业工作不能机械地停留在购销存调赚的范围里，必须主动地为生产服务，促进生产的发展。
    萍乡县的商业工作具有上述特点，不愧为江西省的一面红旗。
