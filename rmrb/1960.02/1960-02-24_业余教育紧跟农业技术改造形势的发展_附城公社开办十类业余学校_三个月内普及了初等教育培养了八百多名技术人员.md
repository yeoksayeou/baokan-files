Amateur Education Closely Follows the Development of Agricultural Technology Transformation
	Fucheng Commune Opens Ten Types of Amateur Schools
	Popularized Elementary Education and Trained More Than 800 Technicians in Three Months
(According to Shanxi Daily) The Fucheng People's Commune in Lingchuan County, with the establishment of factories, farms, forest farms, medicinal herb farms, pig farms, large livestock farms, sheep farms, bee farms, chicken and duck farms, and fish farms, closely combined production and established ten types of amateur Red and Expert schools. The commune established a total of 174 farms (factories), and also ran 174 schools, with 7,154 people participating in literacy, primary, and junior high school studies. In the three months from November of last year to the present, these Red and Expert schools not only completed the literacy task of the entire commune and popularized amateur elementary education, but also trained 850 technical personnel in various fields such as fish farming, sheep farming, and pig farming, greatly promoting the production development of all sectors of the commune.
	After the Fucheng People's Commune vigorously developed the ten farms last year, there was a severe shortage of technical personnel. In some places, the lack of technical personnel caused many difficulties in production. For example, the staff of the Wanjishan Chicken Farm, due to a lack of chicken farming technology and scientific knowledge, caused a large number of deaths. A preliminary calculation by the entire commune showed a shortage of 2,906 various technical personnel. Where would so many technical personnel come from? The commune Party committee and the broad masses believed that they must cultivate them at high speed themselves, and running schools by farms was the best way, so that they could learn and apply at the same time, closely combining labor and learning. However, running schools by farms was a new topic. How should it be done? The commune Party committee sought the opinions of the broad masses and decided, based on the size and number of personnel of each farm (factory), to determine that large farms (factories) would run schools independently, and small farms (factories) would run schools jointly, resolutely implementing the principle of combining production, education, and scientific research, and combining politics, culture, and technology. For example, in addition to the unified content of political and cultural courses in the Red and Expert schools of each farm (factory), the technical courses could be selected according to the specific conditions of each farm (factory) and studied by type of work and industry. The Red and Expert schools of farms would focus on the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture", specifically studying scientific technologies such as grain cultivation, prevention of pests and diseases, water conservancy, soil, and fertilizer. The Red and Expert schools of factories would focus on scientific technologies such as tool reform, civil engineering, and mechanical and electrical engineering. The Red and Expert schools of forestry would focus on scientific technologies such as tree planting and grafting, and fruit tree gardening. The Red and Expert schools of pig farming, sheep farming, and other farms would focus on the scientific technology of animal husbandry. This solved the problem of close integration of education and production. In terms of teaching methods, the method of "unified Red, separate Expert, and separate classes for cultural learning" was adopted. Political classes were held in large centralized classes, cultural classes were divided into classes according to different levels of education, and technical classes were studied according to types of work. In terms of teaching time, a "1, 2, 3" system was adopted, that is, one political class per week, two technical classes per week, and three cultural classes per week. Each study session lasted two hours, with twenty-five classes per month. In terms of teachers, the method of "using local materials, those who are capable are teachers, and combining indigenous and foreign methods" was adopted. In addition to promptly transferring 280 political, cultural, and technical teachers to meet the needs of various Red and Expert schools, the commune also established a normal school, using short-term training and long-term cultivation methods to train teachers in batches to ensure the continuous improvement of teaching quality. In terms of school funding, the method of mass movement and making do with whatever is available was adopted, and it was also appropriately resolved. For example, all the students of the Xiaohuiling Livestock Farm used half a day of voluntary labor to solve the difficulty of purchasing stationery and adding teaching equipment.
	Now it seems that the form of running schools by farms is very good. In summary, it has three major benefits:
	First, through running schools by farms, the broad masses can learn both systematic political and cultural knowledge, and receive systematic production technology education, which greatly improves the socialist consciousness of the masses and promotes the development of the technological and cultural revolutions. For example, Ma Xifa, the director of the Fucheng Agricultural Machinery Repair and Assembly Plant, after studying electrical machinery, not only actively led the factory workers to install electric lights using indigenous methods, but also boldly carried out the reform of 54 kinds of tools. Guo Lifa, the deputy secretary of the Party branch of the Houshan Farm, was greatly inspired after studying the lesson of boldly reforming tools. After painstaking research, he finally created an automatic rotary sieve, increasing efficiency by seventy times. Subsequently, he and his comrades in the farm used indigenous methods to make ceramic pipes and installed underground water pipes, making the water supply automatic for all 1,425 people in the village.
	Second, through running schools by farms, the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor" can be better implemented, so that education and production can be closely combined, and all-rounders who are both Red and Expert can be cultivated more, faster, better, and more economically. For example, the Red and Expert school of the Tanwenghe Bee Farm has enabled 18 people to learn bee-keeping technology in the past two months, and students Shen Tianfa, Shen Chengshun, and others have also become bee-keeping pacesetters. Zhang Tuwang, a pig-raising expert in Biliangzhang, strengthened pig feeding management and built a farrowing room for sows after listening to the pig-raising techniques taught by the Red and Expert school.
	Third, running schools by farms can better combine theory and practice and improve teaching quality. For example, the pig-raising experience of Biliangzhang is relatively prominent, so they compiled it into teaching materials and held on-site meetings to vigorously promote it. Students learned the technology, which promoted the pig-raising work of the entire commune.

    业余教育紧跟农业技术改造形势的发展
    附城公社开办十类业余学校
    三个月内普及了初等教育培养了八百多名技术人员
    据山西日报消息　陵川县附城人民公社随着工厂、农场、林场、药材场、猪场、大牲口场、羊场、蜂场、鸡鸭场和渔场的建立，便紧密结合生产创办了十类业余红专学校。公社共建立了一百七十四个场（厂），学校也办了一百七十四座，有七千一百五十四人参加了这些学校的扫盲、小学和初中学习。从去年11月至今三个月的时间，这些红专学校，不仅完成了全公社的扫盲任务，普及了业余初等教育，而且培训了养鱼、养羊、养猪等各种技术人材八百五十名，大大促进了公社各行各业的生产发展。
    去年附城人民公社大办十场以后，技术人员十分缺乏，有些地方由于缺乏技术人员，给生产带来了不少困难。如万鸡山鸡场工作人员因不懂养鸡技术和科学知识，造成大批死亡。全公社初步计算了一下，缺乏各种技术人材两千九百零六名，这样多的技术人材从那里来呢？公社党委和广大群众认为必须自己高速度地培养，以场办校是最好的形式，这样可以做到边学边用，劳动学习紧密结合。但是，以场办校是一个新课题，怎样办呢？公社党委征求了广大群众意见，决定根据各个场（厂）的规模大小，人员多少，确定大场（厂）单独办校，小场（厂）联合办校，坚决贯彻执行生产、教育、科学研究相结合，政治、文化和技术相结合的原则。比如各个场（厂）红专学校的教材除政治课、文化课统一规定内容外，技术课可根据各个场（厂）的具体情况，按工种行业选定教材进行学习：农场红专学校就以农业八字宪法为主，具体钻研粮食栽培、防止病虫害、水利、土壤、肥料等科学技术；工厂红专学校重点钻研工具改革、土木建筑、机械电气等科学技术；林业红专学校重点钻研植树嫁接、果木园艺等科学技术；养猪、养羊等场的红专学校，重点钻研畜牧的科学技术。这样就解决了教育与生产紧密结合的问题。在教学方法上，采取了“统一红、分别专，文化学习各编班”的方法。政治课集中上大课，文化课按不同文化程度分班学习，技术课按工种作业钻研。教学时间安排上，采取了“一、二、三”制，即政治课每周一次，技术课每周两次，文化课每周三次。每次学习两小时，每月上课二十五次。在师资问题上，采取了“就地取材，能者为师，土洋结合”的方法，除及时抽调了二百八十名政治、文化、技术教师适应各个红专学校的需要外，全社还举办了一座师范学校，运用短期训练，长期培养的方法，分期分批轮训教师，保证了教学质量不断提高。在学校经费开支方面，采取了群众运动、因陋就简的方法，也得到适当解决。如小会岭畜牧场全体学员用半天义务劳动的时间，就解决了购买文具，增添教学设备的困难。
    现在看来，以场办校的形式很好，概括起来有三大好处：
    第一、通过以场办校，使广大群众既能学到系统的政治、文化知识，又能受到系统的生产技术教育，大大提高了群众的社会主义觉悟，促进了技术革命和文化革命的开展。如附城农业机械修配厂厂长马喜法，经过学习电力机械学后，除积极领导全厂职工用土法安装成电灯外，并大胆进行了五十四种工具的改革。后山农场党支部副书记郭理法，在学习了大胆改革工具一课后，思想受到很大启发，经过苦心钻研，终于造成自动转圈箩，提高效率七十倍。随后，他又和场里的同志们一块用土法制成陶瓷管，安装了地下水管，使全村一千四百二十五人吃水自动化。
    第二、通过以场办校，能更好地贯彻党的“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针，使教育与生产得到紧密结合，多快好省地培养出又红又专的多面手。如潭瓮河养蜂场红专学校，两月来就使十八个人学会了养蜂技术，学员申天法、申成顺等五人还成了养蜂标兵。鼻良掌养猪能手张土旺，听了红专学校讲的养猪技术后，便加强了喂猪管理，给母猪盖了接产室。
    第三、以场办校可以更好地做到理论与实践结合，提高教学质量。如鼻良掌的养猪经验比较突出，他们就把它编成教材，并召开现场会议大力推广，学员学到了技术，促进了全公社养猪工作。
