    The Beijing Electron Tube Factory, where the attendance rate reached 100% today, held technical performance competitions in various groups during the first shift. Zhao Dawei, a worker in Workshop 404, improved the needle shape of the diamond die reaming needle, increased the current of the reaming needle, and changed mechanical grinding to electrical discharge machining, reducing the processing time for each diamond die from an average of two and a half hours to half an hour, improving efficiency by more than four times. Today, the factory exceeded its daily output value and electron tube production plans by 27% and 13% respectively, and increased by 7.1% and 3.5% respectively compared to the previous month. It also completed 100% of its product variety and quality plans, achieving safe production. All workshops of the National Red Banner Unit, the Civil Lighting Factory, test drove their equipment one day in advance, and the workers polished the machines with oil until they shone. The attendance rate of the entire factory reached 100% today. Workers at the Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory began to return to the factory and report for duty one after another from yesterday morning, and the attendance rate reached 100% today. Workers at the North China Radio Equipment Factory entered the factory with gongs and drums at the break of dawn to begin production. By noon that day, fourteen workshops in the factory had completed their daily production plans. Many early-shift workers at the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory arrived at the workshop more than an hour early. Some middle-shift workers also came to the workshop in the morning to help with early-shift production. The first two shifts of workers produced eight universal milling machines. The Party Committee Secretary and Director of the Jingxi Mining Bureau, along with leading cadres from various mines, went down the wells with the workers on the first day of production after the holiday, setting off a production upsurge, overfulfilling the daily production plan, and increasing the daily production level by 12.9% compared to the average output in January.
