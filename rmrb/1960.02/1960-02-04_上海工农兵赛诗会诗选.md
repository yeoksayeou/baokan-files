　　　　　　　　　　　　　——Editor

    Red Sky
    Zhou Jisheng, Fitter, Shanghai Electric Meter Factory
    One person red, a red dot;
    Everyone red, a red patch;
    One factory red, not everywhere;
    Every factory red, a red sky.

    Drawing a Sunflower Facing the Sun
    Shen Jian, Boiler Worker, China Dyestuff Factory No. 3
    Master Zhang is old and his surname is Zhang,
    He walks into the poetry competition with a smiling face,
    Yesterday he just took off his illiteracy hat,
    Today he starts writing poems.
    One sentence praising Chairman Mao,
    One sentence thanking the Communist Party,
    The last sentence is full of affection,
    Drawing a sunflower facing the sun.

    Good Hero with a Red Heart Towards the Party
    Li Fuxiang, Shanghai Boiler Factory
    The general line illuminates the chest,
    Full of energy, not afraid of sweating;
    Engaged in innovation, creating new things every day,
    Breaking through key points, charging straight ahead;
    Seizing time, not letting go of every second,
    Good hero with a red heart towards the Party.

    Steel Workers Have Great Ambition
    Qian Zongde, Shanghai Steel Plant No. 5
    Steel workers have great ambition,
    Using molten steel to paint pictures,
    Not painting mountains or rivers,
    Only painting socialist industrialization:
    Molten steel depicts tractors,
    Implementing mechanization in the communes;
    Molten steel paints generators,
    Implementing electrification in the countryside;
    Molten steel paints guns and cannons,
    The enemy will be afraid when they see it.
    Steel workers have great ambition,
    Using molten steel to paint pictures,
    Painting the motherland so beautifully,
    Leap forward flowers blooming everywhere.

    Four Flowers
    Hu Caigong, Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory
    People's Commune has four flowers,
    Four flowers blooming, four fears not:
    Mechanical flower blooming with "iron oxen,"
    Not afraid of no old oxen to plow the fields;
    Electrical flower blooming brightly,
    Not afraid of no stars in the dark night;
    Chemical flower blooming with fertilizer mountains,
    Not afraid of crops not growing strong;
    Water conservancy flower blooming with blue waves,
    Not afraid of the drought demon king afflicting the crops.

    Want to Sing Songs from the Heart
    Wang Hesheng, Shangta Commune, Qingpu County
    Singing folk songs makes the heart bloom,
    Rushing to Shanghai from the edge of Dianshan Lake.
    Want to sing songs from the heart,
    I am a farmer and only sing farming songs.
    Transplanting rice and harvesting rice are not sung,
    Want to sing about the great kindness brought by Chairman Mao.
    Communalization has turned Dianshan Lake around,
    Cai浜 farmers all taste the fruits of happiness.
    State-owned fishing grounds are established,
    Fishing boats with machines catch more fish,
    Dianshan Lake will build a Nine-Bend Bridge,
    Commune members will sit in the rest pavilion.
    Cars drive to the Cai浜 sanatorium,
    Jin's Village directly reaches the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road,
    Comrades, I am not talking nonsense when singing folk songs,
    All rely on our Chairman Mao to steer.

    Remember the Party When Tasting Fresh Fruit
    Qi Yongfang, Xinwu Commune, Songjiang County
    A folk song sung by ten thousand people,
    The song falls and fresh flowers bloom,
    Fresh fruits grow in the middle of the fresh flowers,
    Remembering the Party when tasting fresh fruit.

    Great Leap Forward in Industrial Construction
    Yang Changgen, Shanghai Bicycle Factory
    Wipe sweat, straighten the back,
    Put down the hammer, touch the file,
    Look at the stars, it's still early,
    Great leap forward in industrial construction.

    Praising Socialism
    Chen Wugen, Shanghai Garrison District
    The people I have met may be forgotten,
    Only my own mother cannot be forgotten;
    The places I have been to may be forgotten,
    Only my hometown cannot be forgotten;
    The words I have heard may be forgotten,
    Only the Party's words cannot be forgotten;
    The roads I have walked may be forgotten,
    Only the road of socialism cannot be forgotten.

    The Instructor's Old Uniform
    Chen Zhongyu, Shanghai Garrison District
    The instructor's old uniform,
    Torn like a net.
    The communications soldier said: "Forget it,
    It's still quite good for wiping the table."
    The instructor smiled: "It can still be worn with patching.
    Kid, don't underestimate it,
    Its military age is longer than yours.
    It blocked the wind and snow in the north,
    It followed me to fight the enemy across the Yangtze River,
    It has washed many rivers,
    Full of holes like medals."
    The instructor's old uniform,
    Patched densely, layer upon layer,
    Patches like blossoming flowers,
    Blooming on the light military uniform.
    Soldiers see this uniform,
    Everyone calls it revolutionary uniform.
    Only the communications soldier is silent:
    Quietly mending his broken shoe soles.

    上海工农兵赛诗会诗选
    最近上海市举行了一个“歌颂社会主义、共产主义、争取1960年的更好跃进赛诗、赛歌、赛画大会”，下面的诗歌即选自这个会的赛诗场上。　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者
    红满天上海电表厂钳工　周纪升一人红，红一点；人人红，红一片；一厂红，红不遍；厂厂红，红满天。
    画个葵花向太阳中国染料三厂锅炉工人　沈健师傅年老本姓张，满脸笑容走进赛诗场，昨天刚脱文盲帽，今天动手写诗章。一句歌颂毛主席，一句感谢共产党，最后一句情意重，画个葵花向太阳。
    好英雄赤心向党上海锅炉厂　李福祥总路线照亮胸膛，干劲足不怕流汗；搞革新日日新创，破关键横冲直闯；争时间分秒不让，好英雄赤心向党。
    钢铁工人志气大上钢五厂　钱宗德钢铁工人志气大，蘸着钢水来画画，不画山来不画水，只画社会主义工业化：钢水描下拖拉机，公社实行机械化；钢水绘成发电机，农村实行电气化；钢水画成枪和炮，敌人见了就害怕。钢铁工人志气大，蘸着钢水来画画，画得祖国真美丽，到处开遍跃进花。
    四朵花上海汽轮机厂　胡才功人民公社四朵花，四朵花开四不怕：机械花开有“铁牛”，耕地不怕无老牛；电气花开亮晶晶，黑夜不怕无星星；化学花开肥成山，庄稼不怕长不壮；水利花开碧波荡，庄稼不怕旱魔王。
    心里有话想唱歌青浦县商榻公社　王和生山歌唱得心花开，淀山湖边赶到上海来。心里有话想唱歌，我种田人只唱种田歌。插秧收稻全不唱，要唱毛主席带来恩情多。公社化叫淀山湖翻了身，蔡浜农民齐尝幸福果。国营渔场办起来，机器船捉鱼产量多，淀山湖要造九曲桥，歇凉亭上社员坐。小汽车开到蔡浜疗养所，金家庄直达沪杭路，同志们，我唱山歌不是胡乱说，全靠我们毛主席掌舵。
    尝到鲜果想起党松江县新五公社　戚永芳一首山歌万人唱，歌声落地鲜花放，鲜花中间结鲜果，尝着鲜果想起党。
    工业建设大飞跃上海自行车厂　杨长根擦擦汗，直直腰，放下鎯头摸锉刀，看看星，天还早，工业建设大飞跃。
    歌颂社会主义上海警备区　陈五根我见过的人可能忘了，只有亲娘忘不了；我到过的地方可能忘了，只有家乡忘不了；我听过的话可能忘了，只有党的话忘不了；我走过的路可能忘了，只有社会主义的路忘不了。
    指导员那件旧军装上海警备区　陈忠于指导员那件旧军装，破得好像一张网。通讯员说：“算了吧，擦擦桌子还相当。”指导员笑了笑：“补补还能穿得上。小鬼你别小看它，它的军龄比你长。它挡过北方的风雪，它随我杀敌渡长江，它洗过多少江河水，满身洞眼像奖章。”指导员那件旧军装，密密层层又补上，补钉好像朵朵花，开在淡淡的军装上。战士看到这军装，个个叫它革命装。只有通讯员不作声：悄悄地补着他的破鞋帮。
