The Communist Style of the Great Leap Forward Era
Commercial Workers at the Eight-Hole Sluice Gate Construction Site Provide Excellent Service

    (Our reporter Lü Su Xuan and correspondent Zheng Yan Shi report) Tianjin Wuqing County's commercial departments established a "Mobile Service Station" at the Eight-Hole Sluice Gate water conservancy project site. Using a communist style, they did everything possible to provide supplies and meticulously arranged for the workers' lives, greatly encouraging the workers' enthusiasm and speeding up the project.

    **Setting up Straw Sheds and Small Shops to Organize "Mobile" Supply Service Stations**

    The Eight-Hole Sluice Gate, located within the Yangcun People's Commune, is one of Wuqing County's key water conservancy projects, officially starting construction in late November last year. The more than 2,900 workers mostly lived on the construction site. Originally, the commercial department only set up a means of production sales department on the site, sending two salespeople to sell daily necessities on a mobile basis, leaving early and returning late, which the workers found very inconvenient. Shortly after the official start of construction, the weather turned sharply colder, and the workers, working in mud and water, urgently needed rubber boots. However, at that time, many workers throughout the county were participating in water conservancy construction, and the demand for rubber boots was very high, so the existing stock could not meet the supply. After discovering this situation, the county party committee immediately instructed the finance and trade department and the commerce bureau to find ways to solve the rubber boot problem and improve supply and service work on the construction site. Several responsible comrades of the finance and trade department discussed together and decided to mobilize the finance and trade department's employees to first take out their own rubber boots. After propaganda and mobilization, in one day, the county-level finance and trade department employees took out 186 pairs of rubber boots and sent them to the construction site overnight, selling them to the workers at a low price. Subsequently, the employees of the finance and trade departments of each commune also took out more than 800 pairs of rubber boots, which were successively sent to the construction site. This matter greatly encouraged the workers.

    At this time, the responsible cadres of the Commerce Bureau held a forum of workers on the construction site to solicit their opinions on supply and service work. According to the opinions raised by the workers and the instructions of the county party committee, the Commerce Bureau decided to establish a "Mobile" supply service station on the construction site, mainly relying on the Yangcun People's Commune Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and transferring outstanding employees. After a day and night of hard work by the commercial workers, fifteen straw sheds were set up on the construction site, opening means of production, retail, catering, sewing, laundry, shoe repair, and barber shops. From then on, the supply and service work on the construction site showed a brand-new atmosphere.

    **Supply What the Workers Need, and Deliver It Whenever They Need It**

    The construction site was installing cableway carts and needed 20 ropes, 50 meters long. They called the Yangcun Commune Supply and Marketing Cooperative at night. The Supply and Marketing Cooperative immediately sent someone to deliver them, but because the comrades of the headquarters had specified the wrong specifications, the ropes were not suitable. They then organized members of the Yangcun Commune to process them overnight and delivered the ropes to the construction site early the next morning. They also repaired tools for the workers and actively participated in the construction site's tool reform. They designed five improved tools for the construction site: earth-moving machines, stone-pulling machines, and leap-forward-style stone-crushing hammers.

    The retail department sold cigarettes, alcohol, side dishes, dried and fresh fruits, daily necessities, groceries, and other commodities. When workers came to drink alcohol, they always heated it up. They also sent people to the construction site to provide hot water and other commodities on a mobile basis. In order to take care of the workers on the night shift, the Yangcun Town catering department processed some fried fish and fried meatballs and sent them to the construction site for evening supply, which was especially popular among the workers. For any commodity that the workers needed but the retail department did not have, they always tried their best to buy it for the workers. For example, one worker wanted to buy a tobacco pipe, but neither the retail department nor Yangcun Town had one, so they sent someone to Tianjin to buy one. Another worker wanted to buy a rubber sac for a fountain pen, but the retail department did not have one, so a commercial employee took out the rubber sac he was using and gave it to him.

    **Stewed Cornbread, Baked Dry Rations, Sewing and Washing Clothes, Delivering Letters: Extensive Service**

    The workers' canteen on the construction site only provided staple food and pickles. In order to improve the workers' meals, the catering department of the "Mobile" supply service station, in addition to selling several inexpensive dishes suitable for the workers' needs, also stewed cornbread for the workers, charging only two cents per stew; sold cabbage soup for one cent a bowl, free for those without money; and baked dry rations for the workers, all free of charge. The workers worked day and night shifts, so they operated day and night to ensure that the workers could eat hot soup and hot meals. Due to the low price, good taste, and attentive service, they were deeply welcomed by the workers. The workers gave the cabbage soup a name, calling it "Enthusiasm Soup," saying that it was "delicious, cheap, and warmed people's hearts, and boosted their enthusiasm tenfold." In ten days, they sold more than 24,000 bowls of cabbage soup and stewed cornbread for more than 1,800 worker-times.

    Sewing and washing clothes and repairing broken shoes were particularly popular services among the workers. The nine female comrades in the sewing and washing team followed the workers to the construction site during the day and went to the workers' shacks at night to sew and mend clothes for the workers. When they saw that the workers' shoes and socks were wet, they took them back to dry them. In nine days, they sewed and washed more than 3,500 pieces of clothing for the workers. They only charged for the cost of materials for mending clothes, and one to three cents per piece for washing clothes. They cared for the workers like they cared for their own relatives. When mending clothes for the workers, they were always afraid that the workers would catch a cold, so they always took off their own cotton coats and put them on the workers first. When they saw that some workers' feet and hands were dirty, they boiled water for the workers to wash their faces and feet. When they saw that some workers' skin was injured, they applied medicine and bandaged them. The workers were very grateful to them and called them the "Iron Nine Girls." They also sent them a couplet: "Each stitch inspires enthusiasm, each thread connects hearts."

    There were two full-time staff repairing old shoes. They also repaired them in the retail department during the day and went deep into the workers' shacks to repair them at night. The charges were half the price of those in town, and the repairs were fast and good.

    Some workers' shoes were so badly broken that they could not be repaired, and some brought few clothes, so they had nothing to change into when they brought clothes to be repaired. In order to solve this difficulty for the workers, the County Commerce Bureau selected more than 200 pieces of better old clothes and more than 200 pairs of old shoes from the waste product warehouse, and the employees took time to repair them and send them to the construction site. If they encountered ones that were too broken to be repaired, they exchanged them for the repaired ones; if they encountered ones who brought too few clothes, they lent them to them to wear first.

    The two barbers cut hair quickly, well, and charged little. For the first two days, there were more or fewer people getting their hair cut at times, and some workers had to queue up and wait, delaying their labor. In order to solve this problem, the barbers went to the construction site to work and learned who needed a haircut, registered and numbered them in advance, and eliminated the queuing phenomenon for haircuts.

    The "Mobile" supply service station also had a mobile work group. In addition to assisting each retail department in supplying commodities, they also assisted the construction site in carrying out tool reform; visited workers' families and comforted workers' relatives; delivered letters and ran errands; mailed items; handled savings; helped the workers' canteen improve meals; used their time to go to the construction site to carry out oral propaganda, read newspapers for the workers, organize recreational activities, and treat minor injuries, etc. In short, they did their best to do everything that the workers needed and entrusted to them. This group was composed of an advanced worker who attended the Hebei Provincial Heroes' Conference and five advanced workers who attended the Wuqing County Heroes' Conference. Because of their diligent service, the workers gave them the title of "Heroic Six Brothers and Sisters."

    **Extremely Thoughtful to Ask About Warmth and Health and Care for People**

    Many commercial workers showed a noble communist style in their work. The following incident occurred at the beginning of the "Mobile" supply service station's operation. An elderly worker, Liu Desen, came to the sewing and washing team to ask for a cotton-padded trousers to be mended. However, at that time, the service station had just been established, and the cloth for mending clothes had not yet been brought. Communist Youth League member Liu Xiuqing tore her own shirt and mended the cotton-padded trousers. Liu Desen was so moved that after returning to the team, he publicized this matter to everyone he met, saying, "This is really a good daughter taught by Chairman Mao. Even my own daughter would not treat me so well." This matter quickly spread throughout the entire construction site, greatly stimulating the workers' enthusiasm. The headquarters gave Liu Desen's team a two-day task, which they completed in one day. Someone asked the captain, "Why is your enthusiasm so high?" The captain said, "It was all boosted by Comrade Liu Xiuqing's small jacket!"

    Communist Party member Zhang Wenxu always cared for the workers and helped them overcome difficulties. He worked during the day and visited the workers in the workers' shacks at night to check whether the workers were sleeping well and whether they were warm enough. Once, in the worker's shack of the Nanwangping Management Area of the Meichang Commune, he saw worker Zhou Wanlu was worried. After understanding, he learned that this worker had brought few clothes and wanted to ask for leave to go home to get clothes, but also considered that the project task was urgent, and was in a dilemma. Zhang Wenxu took off his own prize-winning woolen coat from his body and put it on him, moving Zhou Wanlu to tears. He immediately ran to the captain to report this matter and repeatedly thanked Zhang Wenxu. From then on, Zhou Wanlu was very enthusiastic. When carrying bricks, others carried fifty, and he carried a hundred, saying, "I will work with 150% of my enthusiasm to repay Comrade Zhang's concern for us." On another occasion, Zhang Wenxu saw that bricklayer Liu Hongfu had a cold in the worker's shack, so he took out money to make a bowl of brown sugar ginger water for Liu Hongfu to drink. Seeing that Liu Hongfu's quilt was thin, he took his own quilt and covered him. That night, he went to the worker's shack three times in a row to check on his condition. Liu Hongfu went to work early the next morning. The captain asked him, "What medicine did you take that you recovered so quickly?" He said, "It was Comrade Zhang's bowl of ginger soup and a quilt that cured me." These deeds also quickly spread among the workers. Originally, this team was a relatively backward team in work. With the help and influence of Comrade Zhang Wenxu, the team promptly strengthened the education of the workers and quickly became an advanced team in work.

    Comrades Yu Shuqin and Du Yuzhen, both Communist Party members, were also like this. One night, when the weather was very cold, they were woken up by the cold and thought that the workers would also be cold, so they sent their quilts to the workers' shacks and quietly covered the workers with thin quilts. They themselves squeezed together to rest.

    There are many more touching stories like this.

    **Hundreds of Big-Character Posters Praise Them as Relatives of the Workers and Good Daughters of the Party**

    The commercial workers' exemplary actions and noble quality of selflessness encouraged and educated the workers. In a few days, more than 1,200 workers wrote more than 450 big-character posters praising them, saying that they were "relatives of the workers" and "good daughters of the Party," expressing their desire to learn from their enthusiasm and communist style, and promising to repay the Party's concern and the enthusiastic support of the commercial workers with practical actions to complete the sluice gate ahead of schedule. When the workers were pounding, they also composed the following lyrics to sing: "Commercial comrades are not simple! They take care of everything, they are selfless, they give quilts, they send clothes, they disassemble and repair, they sew and wash... Enthusiasm breaks through the sky! Let's learn from them, we will not go home until the gate is built."

    The employees of the commercial departments were also encouraged and educated by the soaring enthusiasm of the workers. They loved and cared for the workers, and the workers also loved and cared for them. When they went to work on the construction site, the workers always advised them to pay attention to rest, saying, "If you are exhausted, who will take care of us!"

    In order to introduce the model deeds and advanced experience of the "Mobile" supply service station at the Eight-Hole Sluice Gate, the Wuqing County Party Committee Finance and Trade Department and the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee Finance and Trade Department successively held on-site meetings here. The people who participated in the on-site meeting were deeply educated after listening to the introduction and visiting, and their enthusiasm was greatly boosted, promoting the work of commercial departments in all aspects. After the responsible comrades of the Maotou People's Commune Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Wuqing County participated in the on-site meeting and returned, they heard that the Eight-Hole Sluice Gate construction site needed reed mats, so they organized the members to process them overnight. Early the next morning, the branch secretary led the managers of each distribution store and personally used wheelbarrows to send the mats, traveling 105 miles in one day and one morning. Now, all small and medium-sized water conservancy construction sites in Wuqing County, where workers live, have established "Mobile" supply service stations. The service work on the construction site is basically contracted by the commercial departments. When there are not enough people, they actively organize employees' families and rural women to participate in sewing and washing and other work. The counties and districts of Tianjin are universally promoting the experience of the Eight-Hole Sluice Gate.

    跃进年代的共产主义风格
    八孔闸工地商业工作者服务工作做得很出色
    本报讯　记者吕素瑄和通讯员郑延石报道：天津市武清县商业部门在八孔闸水利工程工地建立“随军服务站”，用共产主义的风格，千方百计地做好物资供应工作，无微不至地安排民工的生活，大大鼓舞了民工的劳动热情，加快了工程的进度。
    搭席棚办小店组织“随军”供应服务站
    八孔闸在杨村人民公社境内，是武清县重点水利工程之一，去年11月下旬正式开工。民工两千九百多人，大都住在工地上。原先，商业部门在工地上只设了一个生产资料门市部，派了两个售货员在工地上流动出售日用品，早出晚归，民工在生活上感到很不方便。正式开工不久，天气骤冷，民工干活，趟泥趟水，迫切需要胶鞋。可是，当时全县参加水利建设的民工很多，需要胶鞋的数量很大，库存的胶鞋不能满足供应。县委发现这种情况以后，立即指示财贸部和商业局设法解决胶鞋问题，改善工地的供应工作和服务工作。财贸部门几个负责同志共同计议，决定发动财贸部门的职工先把自己的胶鞋拿出来。经过宣传动员，一天时间内，县级财贸部门的职工就拿出一百八十六双胶鞋，连夜送到了工地，廉价卖给民工。随后，各公社财贸部门的职工也拿出八百多双胶鞋，陆续送到工地。这件事，给了民工很大的鼓舞。
    这时候，商业局的负责干部又在工地召开了民工座谈会，征求民工对供应工作和服务工作的意见。根据民工提出的意见和县委的指示，商业局决定，以杨村人民公社供销部为主，抽调优秀职工，在工地建立“随军”供应服务站。经过商业职工一昼夜的努力，在工地上搭起了十五间席棚，开设了生产资料、小卖、饮食、缝补、洗衣、修鞋、理发等门市部。从此，工地的供应工作和服务工作出现了一片崭新气象。
    民工需要什么，就供应什么，什么时候需要，什么时候送到
    工地装制索道滑车，需要用二十根五十米长的麻绳，晚上打电话给杨村公社供销部。供销部立即就派人送去，可是因为指挥部的同志把规格说错了，绳子不合用，他们就连夜组织杨村公社社员加工，第二天一清早把麻绳送到了工地。他们还代民工修理工具，积极参加工地的工具改革。他们为工地设计的运土器、牵引拉石机、跃进式砸石槌等五种改良工具。
    小卖部出卖烟、酒、小菜、干鲜果品、日用百货、杂货等商品。民工来喝酒，他们总是给热好，还抽出人到工地上流动供应热水和其他商品。为了照顾夜班的民工，杨村镇饮食业门市部加工了一些炸鱼、炸丸子，送到工地，晚间供应，特别受到民工的喜爱。民工需要的商品，凡是门市部没有的，他们总是想尽一切办法代民工买来。如有个民工要买烟斗，当时小卖部和杨村镇都没有，他们就派人去天津市买来。还有一个民工要买自来水笔的橡皮囊，小卖部没有，一个商业职工就把自己用的橡皮囊拿来给他。
    烩饽饽，烤干粮，缝洗衣服，传送书信，服务方面广阔
    工地民工食堂只供应主食和咸菜。为了改善民工的伙食，“随军”供应服务站的饮食部除了出卖几种适合民工需要的廉价菜以外，还代民工烩饽饽，烩一次只收两分钱；出卖白菜汤，一分钱一碗，没有钱的免费；代烤干粮，一律不收费。民工日夜轮班干活，他们就日夜营业，保证使民工能吃上热汤热饭。由于价廉味美，服务周到，深受民工欢迎。民工给白菜汤起了一个名，叫“干劲汤”，说是“味美价廉暖人心，喝了干劲增十分”。十天中，出卖白菜汤达两万四千多碗，代民工烩饽饽一千八百多人次。
    缝洗衣服和修理破鞋是特别受到民工欢迎的一项业务。缝洗组的九位女同志，白天跟到工地上，晚上找到工棚里，为民工缝补衣服。见到民工鞋袜湿了，就拿回来替他们烤干。九天之中就为民工缝洗衣物三千五百多件。补衣只收材料费，洗衣每件收一分至三分钱。她们对民工关心体贴，就像对自己的亲人一样。替民工补衣时，怕民工着了凉，总是先脱下自己的棉衣给民工披上。见到有的民工脚脏、手脏，就烧水让民工洗脸、洗脚。见到有的民工皮肤受伤，就给上药、包扎。民工非常感激她们，称她们为“钢铁九姑娘”。还给她们送了一副对联：“针针鼓干劲，线线心连心”。
    修理旧鞋的有两个专职人员，也是白天在门市部修补，晚上深入工棚修补，收费比镇上便宜一半，补得又快又好。
    有的民工鞋子破得实在没有法子再补了，有的带的衣服少，拿来补就没有换的。为了替民工解决这个困难，县商业局从废品仓库中挑出了比较好的旧衣两百多件、旧鞋两百多双，由职工抽空补好，送到工地。遇到过分破不能补的，就用补好的同他们交换；遇到带得少的，就先借给他们穿上。
    两个理发员，理得又多又快又好，收费又少。头两天，理发的人时多时少，有些民工要排队等候，耽误劳动。为了解决这个问题，理发员就到工地一边劳动，一边了解谁需要理发，事先登记排号，消灭了理发排队现象。
    “随军”供应服务站还设有一个机动的工作组。他们除了协助各个门市部供应商品以外，还协助工地搞工具改革；访问民工家庭，慰问民工家属；传送书信，代捎物品；代投邮件；代办储蓄；帮助民工食堂改善伙食；利用下工地时间，开展口头宣传、为民工读报、组织文娱活动、医治轻微创伤，等等。总之，凡属民工需要和民工委托的事情，无不尽力去办。这个组是由一名出席河北省群英会的先进工作者和五名出席武清县群英会的先进工作者组成的。由于他们勤恳服务，民工们送给他们“英雄六兄妹”的称号。
    问寒问暖关心人十分周到
    很多商业工作人员在工作中表现了崇高的共产主义风格。“随军”供应服务站刚开始营业，就出现了这样一件事。一个老年民工刘德森来找缝洗组给补棉裤。可是，当时服务站刚成立，补衣服的布还没有拿来，共青团员刘秀清就把自己的衬衣撕了，把棉裤补好。刘德森感动得不得了，回队以后，逢人就宣扬这件事，说：“这真是毛主席教导出来的好女儿，就是我自己的亲闺女，也不能待我这样好。”这件事很快传遍了整个工地，大大激发了民工的干劲。指挥部交给刘德森这个队两天的任务，他们一天就干完了。有人问队长：“你们的干劲为什么这样足？”队长说：“这都是刘秀清同志的一件小褂给鼓起来的！”
    共产党员张文绪同志，处处关心民工，帮助民工克服困难。他白天工作，夜间到工棚访问民工，检查民工睡的好不好、暖不暖。有一回，他在梅厂公社南王坪管理区民工大队的工棚里，看到民工周万禄正在发愁。经过了解，知道这个民工带的衣服少，想请假回家取衣服又考虑到工程任务紧急，左右为难。张文绪就把自己的一件奖品绒衣从身上脱下给他穿上，感动得周万禄直流眼泪，马上就跑到队长那里，报告这件事，并再三向张文绪致谢。从此以后，周万禄干劲很足，抬砖时，别人抬五十块，他要一百块，说：“我要拿出百分之一百五十的干劲来干活，回答张同志对咱的关心”。还有一回，张文绪在工棚里看到瓦工刘鸿福感冒了，就拿出钱给刘鸿福做了一碗红糖姜水喝。见刘鸿福的被子薄，又把自己的被子拿来给他盖上。这天晚上，连续三次到工棚去探望病情。刘鸿福第二天一清早就上工去了。队长问他：“吃了什么药方，病好得这样快？”他说：“就是张同志的一碗姜汤、一床被子给治好了。”这些事迹也很快在民工中传开了。原先这个队是一个工作比较落后的队，在张文绪同志的帮助和影响下，队部又及时加强了对民工的教育，很快就变成了一个工作先进队。
    共产党员于淑琴、杜玉珍等同志也是这样。有一天夜里，天气很冷，她们被冻醒了，想起民工们也会冷，就把自己的被子送到工棚里，悄悄地给被子薄的民工盖上。而她们自己却几个人挤在一起休息。
    像这样动人的事迹还有很多。
    几百张大字报表扬他们是民工的亲人党的好儿女
    商业职工的模范行动和舍己为人的高贵品质，鼓舞和教育了民工。几天时间，就有一千二百多民工写了四百五十多张大字报表扬他们，说他们是“民工的亲人”，是“党的好儿女”，表示要学习他们的干劲和共产主义风格，并且提出保证：一定要用提前把闸建好的实际行动来报答党的关怀和商业职工的热情支援。民工们在打硪的时候，还编了这样一套歌词唱道：“商业同志不简单！照顾真齐全，舍己为了人，又给盖被，又给送衣，又给拆补，又给缝洗，……干劲冲破天！大家来学习，闸不建完不回家。”
    商业部门的职工们也从民工的冲天干劲中得到鼓舞，得到教育。他们热爱民工，关心民工，民工也热爱他们，关心他们。他们到工地劳动时，民工总是劝他们注意休息，说：“把你们累坏了，还有谁来照顾我们呀！”
    为了介绍八孔闸“随军”供应服务站的模范事迹和先进经验，武清县委财贸部和天津市委财贸部先后在这里召开了现场会议。参加现场会议的人听了介绍和参观以后，受到很深教育，鼓起了更大的干劲，推动了商业部门各方面的工作。武清县码头人民公社供销部的负责同志参加现场会议回去以后，听说八孔闸工地需要苇席，就连夜组织社员加工，第二天一清早，由支部书记带领各分销店经理，亲自用小推车把席子送去，一天和一个早晨，赶了一百零五里路。现在，武清县所有中小型水利工地，凡是住有民工的，都建立了“随军”供应服务站。工地服务工作基本上由商业部门包下来，人手不够，他们就积极组织职工家属和农村妇女参加缝洗等工作。天津市各县、区正在普遍推广八孔闸的经验。
