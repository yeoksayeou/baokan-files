Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, February 12th: The coke ratio of the 27.5 cubic meter No. 2 small blast furnace in the manganese-iron workshop of Banshan Iron and Steel Plant in Zhejiang has reached the level of large blast furnaces. From September of last year to the present, the average coke ratio of this small blast furnace has been maintained at 0.824. At the same time, the output, quality, and cost of pig iron have all reached the advanced level of similar small blast furnaces, making it one of the red flag units in the national metallurgical system.

The conditions for this small blast furnace to reduce the coke ratio are not better than others. The furnace body is brick-built, without a water tower or steel frame. However, the workers have a spirit of dauntlessness. They first focused on the link of three-machine parallel blowing and comprehensive renovation of the hot blast stove, striving to increase the air volume and raise the air temperature. A large air volume and high air temperature can increase smelting intensity and reduce coke consumption. As early as May of last year, they learned from the advanced experience of other factories and creatively changed single-machine blowing to double-machine parallel blowing, and then implemented three-machine parallel blowing. Three-machine parallel blowing was a new thing, and coupled with the intense heat of midsummer at the time, some people were worried that the bearings and hot air pipes of the blowers would be burned. However, under the leadership of the workshop Party organization, the workers, with a spirit of courage to create, successfully researched a method of cooling the bearings with ice water, preventing the bearings from being burned after the air temperature was increased. Hot air workers learned from the experience of other factories and used steam to remove dust from the hot air pipes, preventing the hot air pipes from being burned after the air temperature was increased, creating conditions for implementing three-machine parallel blowing to increase the air volume. After several days of hard work, the three-machine parallel installation was finally successfully trial-installed, and the air pressure immediately increased from 200 mm of mercury column to 255, and the coke ratio quickly dropped from 1.024 to below 0.8, and the output also increased by 11 tons.

After that, the workers continued to improve the tuyeres, increasing the diameter of the tuyeres from 90 mm to 130 mm, and the air volume further increased. The factory leaders also worked with the workers and technicians to further improve the charging system and fully utilize the gas.

Good cooperation is also one of the guarantees for this blast furnace to reduce the coke ratio. After the air volume was increased and the air temperature was raised, the workers of each shift in the whole furnace unified their operations according to the new situation, formulated an operating system of diligent inspection and accurate operation, and a strict handover system. The three shifts of workers held a meeting once a day and a summary of experience meeting once a week to jointly study and improve operating techniques and unify operating methods.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, February 12th: Employees of small sulfuric acid plants in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, continue to learn from advanced experience and boldly improve production equipment and operating techniques, so that the average daily output of each of the city's eight sets of small sulfur-receiving equipment has reached more than three tons, exceeding the designed capacity by more than one time. The average ore consumption is 1.3 tons to 1.4 tons, the cost is reduced to about 200 yuan, and the sulfuric acid concentration is generally stable at 65 to 66 degrees.

Wuxi City originally had no sulfuric acid industry and no technicians to produce sulfuric acid. Last year, according to the design drawings of a small contact sulfuric acid plant with an annual output of 400 tons designed by the East China Design and Research Branch of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the city established a set of small sulfur-receiving production equipment in the Wuxi Refinery. When it was first put into production, due to lack of experience, the general daily output only reached 450 kilograms, and the ore consumption was high, the quality was unstable, and there were many shutdowns for maintenance. The actual production time per month was only about 15 days. At that time, some people believed that small-scale sulfur production was "singing opera with a stone mortar on your head, hard work is not rewarding"; some people believed that engaging in sulfuric acid production was "not doing their proper job." The factory leaders criticized these wrong ideas and insisted on small-scale sulfur production. They visited various places to learn and seek experience, and at the same time, focusing on the weak links in production, they identified key problems such as the imbalance between the front and rear of production equipment, excessive system resistance, and insufficient absorption capacity, and carried out a series of improvements to the original cooling pipes, absorption towers, converters, etc. For example, only one absorption tower was used originally, and a coke filter was installed behind the blower. The absorption capacity was insufficient, there was a lot of tail gas, and a large amount of acid mist was carried out. Sometimes, when the acid pump failed, the chimney was filled with thick smoke, which affected production. They added an absorption tower and added two empty towers in front of the blower to strengthen the absorption capacity and greatly reduce the tail gas compared with the past; at the same time, they also made improvements in operation. Therefore, the daily output gradually increased from 500 kilograms to 1,400 kilograms to 1,500 kilograms, and created a high-yield record of 2,235 kilograms, becoming a red flag in small-scale sulfur production in the country.

The small-scale sulfur production experience of Wuxi Refinery was quickly promoted to other units in the city. Factories and enterprises such as textile factories, chemical factories, and acid-making factories successively established seven sets of small-scale sulfur production equipment and put them into production. The daily output of each set of equipment generally reached more than one ton.

Recently, Wuxi Refinery has also made many improvements in equipment and operation based on the high-yield experience of Wuhu Alliance Chemical Plant, so that the daily output of sulfuric acid has increased sharply from 1,700 kilograms to 4,375 kilograms and 5,422 kilograms. Wuxi Acid Making Plant learned from the high-yield experience of Wuxi Refinery, further increased ore input and unified operations, so that the daily output of sulfuric acid reached 6,699 kilograms. Then, Wuxi Refinery actively learned from the technical experience of other factories and improved equipment, creating a higher record of 6,815 kilograms per day.

Because various factories promoted the spirit of "passing on experience" by advanced personnel and "seeking treasures" by latecomers, catching up with each other, learning from each other and helping each other, and jointly promoting and improving, the average daily output of small sulfur-receiving in the city has increased by one time in more than a month this year. Now the city has newly built eight sets of small sulfur-receiving equipment, which will soon be put into production.

The small-scale sulfur-receiving production equipment in Wuxi City is built by adopting the method of obtaining materials locally, and has the characteristics of less investment, quick results, simple sulfur production process, and easy mastery of operating techniques. A set of small-scale contact sulfuric acid equipment with an annual output of 400 tons only needs an investment of about 15,000 yuan and can be built in 10 to 20 days.

    小洋群革新技术如虎添翼
    半山钢铁厂一座小高炉焦比达到大高炉水平
    无锡小型制硫酸设备日产量超过设计一倍多
    新华社杭州12日电　浙江半山钢铁厂锰铁车间二十七点五立方米二号小高炉的焦比，已经达到了大高炉的水平。从去年9月到目前为止，这座小高炉的焦比平均一直保持在零点八二四。同时，生铁的产量质量和成本，也都达到同类小高炉的先进水平，成为全国冶金系统中红旗单位之一。
    这个小高炉降低焦比的条件不比人家好。炉体是砖砌的，没有水塔和钢铁架子。可是，工人有大无畏的精神。他们首先抓住三机并联鼓风和热风炉全面改装这一环节，努力加大风量，提高风温。风量大、风温高，就可以提高冶炼强度，减少焦炭的消耗。早在去年5月份，他们学习了外厂先进经验，创造性地将单机鼓风改为双机并联鼓风，随后又实行了三机并联鼓风。三机并联鼓风是件新事，又加之当时正是盛暑酷热，开始时有人顾虑怕烧坏了鼓风机的轴承和热风管。但是，工人们在车间党组织的领导下，以勇于创造的精神，研究成功了用冰水冷却轴承的方法，防止了风温提高后轴承被烧坏。热风工学习外厂经验，用蒸气清除热风管里的灰尘，防止风温提高热风管被烧坏，为实行三机并联鼓风加大风量创造了条件。经过几天的苦战，三机并联终于试装成功，风压立刻从二百毫米水银柱递增到二百五十五，焦比迅速由一点零二四下降到零点八以下，产量也上升了十一吨。
    之后，工人们又继续改进了风口，使风口直径由九十毫米增大到一百三十毫米，风量进一步增加。厂的领导干部还和工人、技术人员一起，进一步改进了装料制度，充分利用了煤气。
    搞好大协作，也是这座高炉降低焦比的保证之一。全炉各班工人在风量加大、风温提高以后，根据新的情况统一操作，制订了检查勤、操作准的操作制度和严格的交接班制度。三班工人每天举行一次碰头会，每周举行一次总结经验会，共同研究改进操作技术，统一操作方法。
    新华社南京12日电　江苏省无锡市小型硫酸厂职工不断学习先进经验，大胆改进生产设备和操作技术，使全市八套小接硫设备每套日产量平均达到三吨以上，超过设计能力一倍多，耗矿量平均为一点三吨到一点四吨，成本降低到二百元左右，硫酸浓度一般稳定在六十五度到六十六度。
    无锡市原来是没有硫酸工业、也没有生产硫酸的技术人的城市。去年，这个城市根据化工部华东设计研究分院设计的年产四百吨的小型接触法硫酸厂图纸，在无锡炼油厂建立了一套小接硫生产设备。开始投入生产时，由于缺乏经验，一般日产量只达四百五十公斤，而且耗矿量高、质量不稳定、停工检修多，每月实际生产时间只有十五天左右。当时有的人认为，小接硫生产是“顶着石臼唱戏，吃力不讨好”；有的人认为，搞硫酸生产是“不务正业”。工厂领导方面批判了这些错误思想，坚持了小接硫生产。他们到各地参观学习，求经取宝，同时针对生产上的薄弱环节，找出生产设备前后不平衡、系统阻力太大、吸收能力不够等关键问题，对原有的冷却管、吸收塔、转化器等进行了一系列的改进。例如原来只用一只吸收塔，在鼓风机后面装了一只焦炭过滤器，吸收能力不够，尾气很多，酸雾大量带出，有时酸泵发生故障时，烟囱中更是浓烟密布，影响生产。他们便增加一只吸收塔，又在鼓风机前增加两只空塔，使吸收能力加强，尾气较过去大大减少；同时，在操作上也进行了改进。因此，日产量逐步由五百公斤提高到一千四百公斤到一千五百公斤，并且创造了二千二百三十五公斤的高产纪录，成为全国小接硫生产的红旗。
    无锡炼油厂的小接硫生产经验，很快在本市其他单位推广开来，纺织厂、化工厂、制酸厂等工厂企业先后建立了七套小接硫生产设备投入生产，每套设备的日产量一般都达到了一吨以上。
    最近，无锡炼油厂还根据芜湖联盟化工厂的高产经验，在设备和操作方面作了很多的改进，使硫酸日产量从一千七百公斤猛增到四千三百七十五公斤和五千四百二十二公斤。无锡制酸厂学习无锡炼油厂高产经验，进一步增加投矿量、统一操作，使硫酸日产量达到了六千六百九十九公斤。接着，无锡炼油厂又积极学习外厂技术经验、改进设备，创造了日产六千八百一十五公斤的更高纪录。
    由于各厂发扬了先进者“传经”，后进者“取宝”，你追我赶，我学你帮，共同促进，共同提高的精神，全市小接硫平均日产量在今年的一个多月中增长了一倍。现在全市又新建了小接硫设备八套，很快就要投入生产。
    无锡市的小接硫生产设备，是采用就地取材的办法建造起来的，具有投资少、收效快、生产硫程简单、操作技术容易掌握等特点。一套年产四百吨的小型接触法硫酸设备，只需投资一万五千元左右，十天到二十天就可以建成。
