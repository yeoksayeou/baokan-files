    Xinhua News Agency, February 14th. The All-China Students' Federation today sent a telegram to the Student Committee of the Soviet Youth Organizations Committee, congratulating them on the 10th anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance.

    The telegram said: "The great Sino-Soviet alliance is a powerful fortress for defending world peace. Sino-Soviet friendship is the greatest friendship in human history. The staunch unity of the Sino-Soviet alliance and the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union powerfully strikes at the forces of imperialist war and aggression, and greatly inspires the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in their struggle against imperialism, for the defense of world peace, and for national independence and democratic freedom. Chinese students wholeheartedly thank the Soviet people for their enormous assistance in our country's socialist construction, and will forever follow the teachings of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and continuously strengthen and consolidate the great Sino-Soviet friendship as if cherishing our own eyes."
