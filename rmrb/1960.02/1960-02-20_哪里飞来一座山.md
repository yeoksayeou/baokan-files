Where did a mountain fly from?
Mountains are everywhere by the fields.
Today it looks like a house,
Tomorrow it will block out the sky.
It's not a mountain, it's not a mountain,
But accumulated fertilizer, tens of thousands of loads.

    哪里飞来一座山
    哪里飞来一座山？
    丘丘田边遍是山。
    今天看来屋样大，
    明天看来遮住天。
    不是山来不是山，
    积起肥料千万担。
