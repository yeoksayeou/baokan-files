Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: In January of this year, the national average daily short-distance freight volume reached over 10 million tons, creating the highest monthly local freight volume record in history.

The people's communes running transportation are key to completing short-distance transportation tasks. Currently, over 80% of people's communes nationwide have established more than 50,000 professional and more than 80,000 subsidiary transportation teams, based on the size of their annual and seasonal transportation volumes.

Liaoning, Shandong, Henan and other provinces have widely promoted the experience of "one station, four teams," that is, under the direct leadership of the commune transportation station, professional transportation teams, subsidiary transportation teams, loading and unloading teams, and road maintenance teams have been established. Some communes have also established tool repair factories, so that transportation has taken root in the people's communes, forming a complete basic transportation organization.

The "Eight Checks and Eight Establishments" experience of Sichuan Quxian Li Du People's Commune in consolidating professional transportation teams has been widely promoted throughout the country. The "Eight Checks and Eight Establishments" are: Check organization and management, establish full-time leadership; Check indicators, establish a production management quota system; Check efficiency, promote advanced experience and technological innovation; Check income, improve the rational distribution system; Check expenses, improve financial management; Check tools, establish storage and repair systems; Check enthusiasm, establish competition and evaluation systems; Check living conditions, establish a reasonable welfare system. When promoting these experiences, people's communes in various parts of Gansu also adopted the methods of "three selections" and "three determinations," selecting vehicles, horses, and people, and determining vehicles, horses, and people, so that the professional transportation teams can be strong in personnel, have strong horses, and good vehicles. The teams are divided and managed centrally, and uniformly dispatched and used, greatly giving play to the potential of folk transportation tools.

With the development of water conservancy construction and spring plowing preparations, although the number of people participating in short-distance transportation in January decreased by about 10% compared with December last year, under the leadership of party committees at all levels, transportation departments in various regions adopted the method of grasping transportation on the one hand and transportation construction on the other, quickly enhancing short-distance transportation capacity, thereby ensuring the completion of more material transportation tasks with less labor.

In the first half of January, Sichuan Province built and rebuilt 720 kilometers of roads, opened up and renovated 288 kilometers of waterways, newly built 131 kilometers of various tracks, built more than 10,000 tons of ships, and built 30,000 vehicles, creating conditions for winning a full house in the first quarter of the year. According to the principles of adapting to local conditions, using local materials, and self-reliance, they adopted the method of "simultaneous construction, repair, and transformation, combined adjustment, purchase, and maintenance," so that transportation construction was carried out more, faster, better, and more economically. "Construction" means mobilizing counties, districts, and communes to build vehicles and ships on a large scale; "Repair" means repairing old and broken vehicles and ships, and repairing roads and waterways; "Transformation" means improving transportation tools, making them lighter and more ingenious, and improving transportation efficiency; "Adjustment" means transferring surplus livestock vehicles from communes or those unsuitable for agricultural work to participate in professional transportation; "Purchase" means purchasing vehicles and cattle to increase vehicles and livestock, so as to increase production without increasing manpower; "Maintenance" means vigorously carrying out road and waterway maintenance and livestock breeding.

At the same time, the transportation organizations of people's communes in various regions have also universally launched a technological innovation movement centered on improving folk transportation tools and transportation methods. In Meishan County, Sichuan, two teams of single-wheel barrows were assembled into a two-wheel flatbed cart, replacing human power with animal power, and the load capacity increased from 150 kg to 400 kg. They also changed double-wheel rubber carts to four-wheel and six-wheel animal-powered carts. One cart and one animal can carry 1,300 kg of goods at a time, increasing transportation efficiency by nearly three times compared to before the modification. In Simaqiao People's Commune, Daoxian County, Hunan, a short-axle ox-drawn cart was made, increasing the load capacity from 50 kg to 650 kg; later, iron palms were nailed to the ox's hooves, and it could travel 80 li a day, greatly accelerating the turnover of the ox cart.

On the short-distance transportation front, the "one-dragon" transportation large-scale collaboration that combines modern transportation tools with folk transportation tools has also been widely promoted. Gansu and Shanxi provinces have universally implemented automobiles running on trunk lines, animal-powered vehicles running on branch lines, and pack animals running on mountain roads, assigning fixed points and areas, each displaying its strengths, greatly improving transportation efficiency. Pingliang City adopted this method, and horse-drawn carriages and automobiles implemented relay transportation, which increased the daily turnover of double-shift automobiles of the same tonnage by 42%, and the daily turnover of horse-drawn carriages by 22%. Hubei Province's long-distance trunk lines and short-distance branch lines, with large "dragons" leading small "dragons," small "dragons" protecting large "dragons," and short "dragons" protecting long "dragons," formed a land and water transportation "dragon" network, shortening the material transit time, accelerating the turnover of vehicles and ships, and saving transportation costs.

    全国建立五万多专业运输队和八万多副业运输队
    公社办运输日运千万吨
    新华社讯　今年1月份，全国短途运输平均日运量达到了一千万吨以上，全月创造了历年来月度地方货运量的最高纪录。
    人民公社办交通运输，是完成短途运输任务的关键。目前，全国有80％以上的人民公社都根据常年运输量和季节性运量的大小，建立了五万多个专业和八万多个副业运输队。
    辽宁、山东、河南等省普遍推广了“一站四队”的经验，即在公社交通运输站的直接领导下，成立了专业运输队、副业运输队、装卸队和养路队。有些公社还设立工具修制厂，使交通运输在人民公社扎了根，形成一个完整的交通基层组织。
    四川渠县李渡人民公社整顿专业运输队的“八查八建”经验，已在全国各地普遍推广。“八查八建”是：查组织管理，建立专职领导；查指标，建立生产管理定额制度；查效率，推广先进经验和技术革新；查收入，健全合理分配制度；查开支，健全财务管理；查工具，建立保管和修理制度；查干劲，建立竞赛评比制度；查生活，建立合理的福利制度。甘肃各地人民公社在推广这些经验时，又采取“三选”和“三定”的办法，选车、选马、选人和定车、定马、定人，使专业运输队做到人强、马壮、车辆好，按队分编，集中管理，统一调度使用，大大发挥了民间运输工具的潜力。
    随着水利建设和春耕准备工作的开展，1月份参加短途运输的人数虽然比去年12月份下降了10％左右，但在各级党委的领导下，各地交通运输部门采用一手抓运输一手抓交通建设的办法，迅速增强了短途运输能力，从而保证了以较少的劳动力完成更多的物资运输任务。
    四川省在1月上半月修建和改建公路七百二十公里，开辟和整治航道二百八十八公里，新建各种轨道一百三十一公里，造船一万多吨，造车三万辆，为夺取全年首季满堂红创造了条件。他们根据因地制宜、就地取材、自力更生的原则，采取“造、修、改并举，调、购、养结合”的办法，使交通建设进行得又多又快又好又省。“造”就是发动县、区、公社大造车船；“修”就是修复破旧车船，整修道路和航道；“改”就是改良运输工具，使之由重变轻、由笨变巧，提高运输效率；“调”就是把公社多余的或不适于农业耕作的畜力车辆抽调出来参加专业运输；“购”就是购车、购牛，以增车增畜，做到增产不增人；“养”就是大搞道路、航道的养护和牲畜的饲养。
    同时，各地人民公社的运输组织还普遍开展了以改良民间运输工具和运输方式为中心的技术革新运动。四川眉山县将两部独轮鸡公车队装成一部两轮平车，以畜力代替人力，载重量由一百五十公斤增加到四百公斤。他们还把双轮胶车改为四轮、六轮畜力车，一车一畜一次能装一千三百公斤货物，比改装前提高运输效率近三倍。湖南道县四马桥人民公社制成一种短轴牛拉车，载重量由五十公斤提高到六百五十公斤；后来又给牛蹄钉上铁掌，一天能走八十里，大大加速了牛车的周转。
    在短途运输战线上，还普遍推广了现代运输工具同民间运输工具结合起来的“一条龙”运输大协作。甘肃、山西两省普遍实行了汽车跑干线、畜力车跑支线、驮畜跑山道，定点划片，各展所长，大大提高了运输效率。平凉市采取这种办法，马车和汽车实行接力运输，使得同吨位双班汽车日周转量提高42％，马车日周转量提高22％。湖北全省长途干线和短途支线，以大“龙”带小“龙”、小“龙”保大“龙”、短“龙”保长“龙”的方式，组成水陆运输“龙”网，缩短了物资中转停留时间，加速了车船周转，节约了运输费用。
