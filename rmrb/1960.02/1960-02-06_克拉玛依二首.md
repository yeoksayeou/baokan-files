    Two Poems on Karamay
    Xiaoyun
      Karamay, Karamay, how big is the oil field? Five years of exploration cannot answer. The entire Junggar Basin shows oil and gas, but Karamay only occupies the edge of the basin. If you ask how large the developed area is? Please stand on the Tianshan Mountains and look at the drilling towers. You won't be able to walk it in three days and three nights. As for the length? Ten rainbows can't connect to the edge. Ho, the scale is like this after five years, what will happen in ten years? Comrades! The Yangtze River is not long, and the Yellow River is not wide! Oil pipelines will be installed all over the country, and Karamay is the source.
    The people of Karamay, regardless of mine managers, workers, mayors, and residents, all have the scent of oil on them. Cars and tractors drive out of factories, and the voices of workers and farmers wanting oil always ring in their ears. Use drilling rigs to chisel ten thousand holes and a thousand windows in the earth, so that oil springs and oil rivers converge into an ocean of oil. The Party and the people give us unparalleled strength, and day and night we transport power and fire to the motherland. What can stop us? The socialist sun burns in our hearts. To build a powerful petroleum base for the socialist motherland, what force can stop the heroic tigers of Karamay!

    克拉玛依二首
    笑云
      克拉玛依克拉玛依油田有多大？五年的勘探还不能回答。整个准噶尔盆地都显示油气，克拉玛依才占了个盆边子。若问已开发的面积有多大？请你站在天山顶上望钻塔。你三天三夜也走不完，长度吗？十条采虹连不到边。嗬，五年规模就这样，再过十年怎么办？同志！长江不算长黄河不算宽！全国装遍输油管，克拉玛依是流源。
    克拉玛依人不论矿长工人市长和居民，克拉玛依人身上都有油香。汽车拖拉机开出工厂，耳边总响着工人农民要石油的声响。用钻机把地球凿开万孔千窗，让油泉油河汇流成石油的海洋，党和人民给我们无比的力量，日日夜夜为祖国输送着动力和火光。什么能把我们阻挡？我们胸中燃烧着社会主义的太阳。为社会主义祖国建设强大的石油基地，什么力量能挡住克拉玛依的英雄虎将！
