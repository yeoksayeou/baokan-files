　　 Zhengzhou, February 12th (This newspaper dispatch) The CPC Nanyang Prefectural Committee, in the one million three hundred thousand mu of land bordering the four counties of Nanyang, Dengxian, Xinye, and Tanghe and belonging to ten people's communes, established a million-mu mechanized well area, launching a large-scale mass well-digging movement.

　　This million-mu mechanized well area is located in the center of the Nanyang Basin. During the seventy-five days of severe drought in the autumn of 1959, the Baihe River, which runs across the basin, stopped flowing, and the original wells and springs were few and had small yields, which were also insufficient. Therefore, when the CPC Nanyang Prefectural Committee vigorously carried out water conservancy construction last winter, based on the "three selfs" principle and the spirit of realizing "double insurance of wells and canals," and summarizing and applying the experience of vigorously developing Fengchanfang (high-yield areas), it decided to establish a million-mu mechanized well area to promote the well-digging movement throughout the region using the method of leading the whole area with one area.

　　When the mechanized well area began to be delineated in November last year, some cadres and the masses did not sufficiently recognize the importance of digging mechanized wells and had the one-sided idea of "valuing canals and abandoning wells," preferring to engage in large-scale water conservancy projects rather than small-scale mechanized well projects. In response to these ideas, a mass debate was launched in the ten communes belonging to the mechanized well area. By presenting the facts and calculating the overall benefits, it was proven that only using both surface water and groundwater is a long-term plan to ensure that agricultural production is not affected by drought and flood disasters. Currently, the surface water in the million-mu mechanized well area can only guarantee 50% of the water demand, and the remaining 50% needs to rely on groundwater resources. Only using surface water and not digging groundwater cannot guarantee a comprehensive bumper harvest. In low-lying areas with abundant water sources, people were initially unwilling to dig wells. Through debate, everyone realized that digging mechanized wells can not only prevent drought but also drain waterlogged areas. For example, with the digging of each mechanized well, the groundwater level within a 300-meter radius nearby immediately drops, which also has a significant effect on flood prevention.

　　After solving the ideological problem of digging mechanized wells, the masses were highly motivated and quickly set off a high tide of well digging. The prefectural committee and the county committees of the four counties all transferred responsible cadres to form a command headquarters for the mechanized well area, and command posts were established at the commune level, drawing 18,000 laborers from the ten communes to divide the work and assign areas of responsibility to carry out intensive well digging. In the case of insufficient well-digging tools, the superiority of the people's communes was fully utilized, breaking down county and commune boundaries, and unifying and concentrating all well-digging and spring-tapping tools, distributing them in sets, and using them in a unified way. Furthermore, a flow-line operation method was adopted to ensure that people were idle but tools were not, thereby improving the efficiency of tool utilization. In order to systematize wells and canals within the mechanized well area, a comprehensive plan was made for the million mu of land, adapting to local conditions. Generally, there is one mechanized well per 300 mu, and at the same time, old wells are utilized as much as possible. The plan for the entire area is to dig 2,200 new mechanized wells.

　　Since the start of construction in mid-November last year, the commune members engaged in the well-digging task for the entire area have been highly motivated, carrying out technological revolutions and speeding up the construction of mechanized wells. The Watian Commune in Nanyang County and the Xiaji Commune in Dengxian County successfully created rocket cones, digging a mechanized well in just two or three days. The labor force used per unit was also reduced from 24 people to 12 people. The command headquarters immediately promoted this advanced experience throughout the entire area. The Watian Commune created a rapid kiln-firing method, firing 7,000 bricks in one day and one night, and also firing bricks directly from wet adobe, solving the difficulty of not being able to make adobe and fire bricks in the severe winter. Within the entire area, many brick factories, mat factories, iron factories, wood factories, and repair shops were also established relying on the strength of the communes, basically meeting the needs of the project. Due to the improved work efficiency and accelerated speed, in the past two months, 2,960 mechanized wells have been dug on the one million three hundred thousand mu of land, and 440 are under construction, exceeding the task. Furthermore, each mechanized well has been equipped with a set of water lifting tools. The ten people's communes belonging to the mechanized well area have all achieved double insurance of wells and canals, guaranteeing good harvests despite drought or flood. Under the current circumstances of spring drought and insufficient surface water, more than 95% of the wheat fields in the mechanized well area are using new wells to extensively irrigate with revival water.

　　The experience of delineating areas and digging mechanized wells has been widely promoted in the Nanyang region. The entire region also plans to build two more million-mu mechanized well areas, preparing to dig 30,000 more wells and tap springs throughout the region this spring while vigorously developing gravity irrigation, so that the ten million mu of plain areas will basically achieve double insurance of wells and canals.

### 南阳专区运用丰产方的经验建成百万亩机井方  井渠双保险　旱涝保丰收  充分利用地下水源方内小麦普浇返青水抗御春旱

    南阳专区运用丰产方的经验建成百万亩机井方
    井渠双保险　旱涝保丰收
    充分利用地下水源方内小麦普浇返青水抗御春旱
    本报郑州12日电　中共河南省南阳地委在南阳、邓县、新野、唐河四个县交界处十个人民公社的一百三十万亩土地上，建立了一个百万亩机井方，开展大规模的群众性打机井运动。
    这个百万亩机井方位于南阳盆地的中心。在1959年秋大旱七十五天的情况下，横贯盆地的白河断了流，原有的井泉少，出水量小，也不够用。因此，中共南阳地委在去冬大搞水利建设运动时，本着“三主”方针和实现“井渠双保险”的精神，并总结运用大搞丰产方的经验，决定建立百万亩机井方，用以方带面的方法，推动全区的打机井运动。
    去年11月间，机井方开始划方的时候，部分干部和群众对打机井的重要性认识不足，存在“重渠废井”的片面思想，愿搞大型水利工程，不愿搞小型的机井工程。针对这些思想，在机井方所属的十个公社内，展开了群众性的辩论，通过摆事实、算大账的办法，证明只有地上水、地下水并用，才是保证农业生产不受旱、涝灾害影响的百年大计。现在百万亩机井方里的地上水，只能保证50％的用水量，还有50％需要依靠地下水源。只用地上水，不挖地下水，即不能保证全面大丰收。在水源充足的低洼地区开始也不愿打井。通过辩论，大家认识到打机井不仅可以防旱，还能排涝。如每打一眼机井，附近三百米周围的地下水位立即下降，对防涝也有重大作用。
    解决了打机井的思想问题以后，群众干劲很大，迅速掀起了打井高潮。地委和四个县的县委都抽调了负责干部，组成机井方指挥部，又以社为单位成立指挥所，从十个公社抽调了一万八千个劳力，分片包干，突击打井。在打井工具不足的情况下，充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，打破县界、社界，把所有打井下泉工具统一集中起来，配成套，统一使用。并且采取流水作业法，做到人闲工具不闲，提高了工具使用效率。为了在机井方内做到井渠系统化，对百万亩土地都因地制宜，进行了全面规划。一般是三百亩一眼机井，同时尽量利用旧井，全方规划新打二千二百眼机井。
    从去年11月中旬开工以来，投入全方打井任务的社员都干劲冲天，大闹技术革命，加快机井建设的速度。南阳县瓦店公社和邓县的夏集公社创制成功火箭锥，两三天就打一眼机井，每部使用的劳力也由二十四人减少到十二人，指挥部马上在全方推广了这个先进经验。瓦店公社创造了快速烧窑法，一天一夜烧成七千块砖，并且用湿坯直接烧成砖，解决了严冬不能制坯烧砖的困难。全方内还依靠公社力量，建立了许多砖厂、席厂、铁工厂、木工厂、修配厂，基本满足了工程的需要。由于提高了工效、加快了速度，两个月来，已在一百三十万亩土地上，打机井二千九百六十眼，正在施工的四百四十眼，超额完成了任务，并且每个机井都配备了一套提水工具。机井方内所属的十个人民公社已全部实现了井渠双保险，旱涝保丰收。在当前春旱侵袭，地上水不足的情况下，机井方内95％以上的麦田都利用新井大浇返青水。
    划方打机井的经验，已经在南阳地区普遍推广，全区还计划再搞两个百万亩机井方，准备今春全区在大搞自流灌溉的同时，再打井下泉三万眼，使一千万亩平原地区基本实现井渠双保险。　（方徨）
