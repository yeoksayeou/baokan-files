    Natural gas is formed from the remains of dead organisms from various historical periods of the Earth, buried underground and subjected to the effects of temperature, pressure, and bacterial decomposition.

    The main component of natural gas is methane. According to the analysis of natural gas composition in the Shanghai area, methane accounts for about 90 percent. One cubic meter of methane releases as much as 9,460 kilocalories when burned. Therefore, natural gas is a very good fuel, with a higher heat value than gas and artificial biogas.

    天然气
    天然气是地球各个历史时期中，死掉的生物遗体埋藏地下，经受温度和压力的作用以及细菌的分解而形成的。
    天然气的主要成份是甲烷。据上海地区天然气成份分析，甲烷占百分之九十左右。一立方米的甲烷燃烧时发出的热量高达九千四百六十大卡。因此，天然气是一种很好的燃料，热量比煤气和人工沼气高。
