Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd: The State Council's instructions regarding the reception and resettlement of returned overseas Chinese, February 2, 1960.

Our country has tens of millions of overseas Chinese residing abroad. In the old China, a large number of overseas Chinese drifted overseas to make a living. They worked together with the local people and made indelible contributions to the economic and cultural development of their countries of residence. In the struggle for national independence in their countries of residence, they also fought side by side with the local people, shedding blood and sweat. Therefore, overseas Chinese have not only formed close friendship with the local people but also played a positive role in developing friendly relations between the Chinese people and the people of relevant countries. After the founding of New China, overseas Chinese successively returned to the country and were properly settled by the motherland. They are playing an active role in the socialist construction of the motherland.

The Chinese government has consistently been willing to consult with relevant countries on resolving all issues related to overseas Chinese, including the issue of dual nationality, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Chinese government is willing to see overseas Chinese who have resided abroad for a long time choose the nationality of their country of residence based on the principle of voluntariness. As for overseas Chinese who voluntarily retain Chinese nationality, the Chinese government has always encouraged them to abide by the laws of their country of residence and strive to contribute to the economic and cultural development of their country of residence, and their legitimate rights and interests should of course be effectively protected. The above-mentioned policy of the Chinese government has been consistent and will not change in the future. Regrettably, anti-China and anti-Chinese activities have recently emerged in certain countries in Southeast Asia, and large numbers of overseas Chinese have been persecuted for no reason. In view of this situation, the Chinese government has decided that for those overseas Chinese who are displaced, unable to make a living, or unwilling to continue living abroad, it will, according to their wishes, settle them in the country to live and participate in construction. Our country's socialist construction is developing rapidly, and our manpower is not excessive but insufficient. Therefore, we not only warmly welcome persecuted overseas Chinese to return to the country but also warmly welcome all overseas Chinese who are willing to return to contribute to the socialist construction of the motherland.

In order to do a good job in receiving and settling returned overseas Chinese, the following instructions are hereby issued:

(1) It is decided to establish the "People's Republic of China Reception and Settlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese" to be responsible for the overall planning of the reception and settlement of returned overseas Chinese.

    Liao Chengzhi is appointed as the chairman of the committee, and Tao Zhu, Ye Fei, Liu Jianxun, Yan Hongyan, Chen Jiageng, and Wang Zhen are appointed as vice-chairmen. Fang Fang, Zhuang Xiquan, Mao Qihua, Chen Qiyuan, Dong Chuncai, Sun Dagang, Zhang Zhuguo, Qin Lizhen, Zhang Xiaoping, Hu Renkui, Min Yimin, Shen Zijiu, Zhang Chao, You Yangzu, Wang Yuanxing, Huang Jie, Wu Yixiu, and Li Mei are appointed as members. The committee will set up an office, with Fang Fang concurrently serving as the director of the office.

(2) Reception agencies shall be established at the ports of entry for returned overseas Chinese, such as Guangzhou, Shantou, Zhanjiang, and Haikou, to be responsible for the reception of returned overseas Chinese.

(3) In order to properly settle returned overseas Chinese so that they can actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland, the People's Committees of Guangdong, Fujian, Guangxi, Yunnan and other provinces (autonomous regions) are specifically instructed to do a good job in the settlement of returned overseas Chinese.

(4) The expenses for the reception and settlement of returned overseas Chinese shall be budgeted separately by the People's Committees of the relevant provinces (autonomous regions), and submitted to the "People's Republic of China Reception and Settlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese" for review before being submitted to the State Council for approval and allocation.

(5) The following provisions are specifically made regarding the principles for settling returned overseas Chinese:

    1.  Work for returned overseas Chinese shall be properly arranged based on the needs of the country and individual wishes.

    2.  Returned overseas Chinese students and vocational youths with learning conditions shall be arranged to study according to their school age and educational level. The state shall provide scholarships for those with financial difficulties.

    3.  Returned overseas Chinese who wish to return to their original places of origin to reunite with their relatives shall be properly settled by the relevant People's Committees and People's Communes.

    4.  Localities should provide appropriate care for the lives of returned overseas Chinese.

(6) The following provisions are specifically made regarding the property brought back by returned overseas Chinese:

    1.  All luggage and items brought back by returned overseas Chinese shall be exempt from customs duties.

    2.  All property brought back by returned overseas Chinese shall forever belong to individuals.

    国务院发布接待和安置归侨的指示
    热烈欢迎所有愿意回国的华侨回来参加祖国飞跃发展的社会主义建设
    决定成立中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会并规定安置原则
    新华社2日讯　国务院关于接待和安置归国华侨的指示
                            1960年2月2日
    我国在海外的华侨，数以千万计。旧中国时代，大批华侨为了谋求生计，飘泊海外，他们同当地人民共同劳动，对侨居国经济、文化的发展做出了不能抹煞的贡献。在侨居国争取民族独立的斗争中，他们也同当地人民并肩作战，流过血汗。因此，华侨不仅同当地人民结成了亲密的友谊，而且为发展中国人民和有关国家人民间的友好关系起了良好的作用。新中国成立后，海外华侨陆续回国，得到了祖国妥善的安置。他们在祖国的社会主义建设事业中，发挥着积极的作用。
    我国政府一贯愿意根据和平共处的五项原则同有关国家协商解决包括双重国籍问题在内的一切有关华侨的问题。我国政府愿意看到久居海外的华侨根据自愿原则，选择侨居国国籍，至于自愿保留中国国籍的华侨，我国政府也一贯勉励他们遵守侨居国的法令，对侨居国的经济和文化发展努力作出贡献，而他们的正当权利和利益，当然也应当受到切实的保护。我国政府的上述政策是始终如一的，将来也不会改变。令人遗憾的是，近来在东南亚某些国家中出现了反华、排华的活动，大批华侨无端遭受迫害。鉴于这种情况，我国政府决定，对于那些流离失所、无法谋生或者不愿意继续在海外居留的华侨，将根据他们的志愿，安置他们在国内生活和参加建设。我国社会主义建设正在飞跃发展，我国的人力不是过多而是不足。因此，我们不仅热烈欢迎受到迫害的华侨回国，而且也热烈欢迎所有愿意回国的华侨回来，为祖国的社会主义建设贡献力量。
    为了做好接待和安置归国华侨的工作，现特发布以下的指示：
    （一）决定成立“中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会”，负责统筹归国华侨的接待和安置工作。
    任命瘳承志为主任委员，陶铸、叶飞、刘建勋、阎红彦、陈嘉庚、王震六人为副主任委员，方方、庄希泉、毛齐华、陈其瑗、董纯才、孙大光、张柱国、秦力真、张孝屏、胡仁奎、闵一民、沈兹九、张超、尤扬祖、王源兴、黄洁、吴益修、李梅等十八人为委员。委员会下设办公室，由方方兼任办公室主任。
    （二）在广州、汕头、湛江、海口等归国华侨入境的港口，设立接待机构，负责接待归国华侨的工作。
    （三）为了妥善安置归国华侨，使他们能够积极参加祖国的社会主义建设事业，特责成广东、福建、广西、云南等省（自治区）的人民委员会负责做好归国华侨的安置工作。
    （四）关于接待和安置归国华侨工作的经费，由有关各省（自治区）的人民委员会另外编造预算，经“中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会”审核后，报请国务院批拨。
    （五）关于归国华侨的安置原则，特作如下规定：
    1、根据国家的需要和个人的志愿，妥善安排归国华侨的工作；
    2、归国华侨学生和具有学习条件的职业青年，依据其学龄和文化程度安排就学；经济有困难者，国家给予助学金；
    3、归国华侨中有愿意回原籍同亲属团聚者，由有关人民委员会和人民公社妥善安置；
    4、对归国华侨的生活，各地应当给予适当的照顾。
    （六）对归国华侨带回的财物，特作如下规定：
    1、归国华侨带回的一切行李、物品一律免收关税；
    2、归国华侨带回的一切财物，永远归个人所有。
