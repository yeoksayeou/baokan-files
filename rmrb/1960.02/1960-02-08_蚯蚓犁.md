    Earthworm Plow
    The earthworm works twenty-four hours a day and night, plowing and fertilizing the land. In twenty years, earthworms can complete a humus layer nearly seven centimeters thick.
    According to experts' precise calculations, the land plowed by 10,000 earthworms in one hour is more than the land plowed by a good horse in the same amount of time. (Translated by Wen Hong)

    蚯蚓犁
    蚯蚓一昼夜工作二十四小时，它耕地兼施肥，蚯蚓在二十年间能完成近七厘米厚的腐植土层。
    根据专家精确的计算，一万条蚯蚓一小时所耕的地比一匹好马同时间所耕的地多。（文宏译）
