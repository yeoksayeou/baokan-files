    The Use of Mathematics
    How to Calculate Leaf Area?
    Hua Luogeng

The growth of rice, wheat, and all other crops depends on photosynthesis. Leaves are an important part of plants for photosynthesis. Therefore, when studying plant growth, it is necessary to consider the area of its leaves. Especially when studying high-yield experiences, it is often necessary to calculate the leaf area.

The shape of a leaf surface is bounded by curves. Of course, its area can be calculated using a planimeter or calculus, but it is not very practical when calculating a large number of leaf areas, not to mention problems such as the unavailability of instruments or the lack of knowledge of calculus.

Plant physiologists often use a simple formula to calculate: "Leaf area equals length times width divided by 1.2".

This is a good formula, but like general empirical formulas, it has its limitations. We will clearly draw a visual method so that people can see at a glance which leaves can use this formula and which cannot.

First consider the figure shown: two rectangles with width *d* and length *?*, plus an isosceles triangle with base *d* and height *?*. The area of this figure is equal to 2*?d* + 1/2*?d* = 5/2*?d*. If we imagine it as a leaf, the leaf length is 3*?*, the width is *d*, and the length times width is 3*?d*, which is 3 ÷ 5/2 = 1.2 times the original area.

What does this illustrate? If the leaf roughly "tapers" at 2/3 of its length, this formula can be used to estimate the leaf area; otherwise, it needs to be reconsidered. In the case of dense planting, if the tips of the rice leaves are longer, this formula should be modified as necessary.

More fundamentally, it inspires a method that can be used to calculate leaf area and estimate sheepskin area. It is the method of finding empirical formulas: first measure the area of a batch of sheepskins, divide the area of each sheepskin by the product of its spine length and waist circumference, and obtain a batch of ratios. Find the average of these ratios and let C be this average value. In this way, an empirical formula can be obtained: the area of the sheepskin is equal to the spine length times the waist circumference times a constant C.

By analogy, it is certainly not limited to calculating sheepskin, nor is it limited to finding area. Just note that area has two degrees of freedom, so it is obtained by multiplying length and width by a proportional coefficient. Similarly, volume has three degrees of freedom and can be obtained by the product of length, width, height, and a proportional coefficient.

〔Editor's Note〕 Comrade Hua Luogeng, Director of the Institute of Mathematics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has initially drafted more than a dozen topics for the "The Use of Mathematics" column he writes for this newspaper's supplement, including "How to Calculate Reservoir Capacity," "How to Allocate Transportation," "Calculating Mountain Slope Area," "Estimating Grain Stocks," and "Calculating Haystacks," which will be published successively.

Mathematics is a science with a wide range of applications in production and life. The problems that Comrade Hua Luogeng is preparing to write about are mostly related to China's current industrial and agricultural production and construction. We believe that "The Use of Mathematics" column will help readers solve some problems in practical work, and we also welcome readers to report to us the math-related problems they encounter in their work.

    数学的用场
    怎样计算叶面积？
    华罗庚
    稻子麦子和其他一切农作物的生长，都依赖于光合作用。叶子是植物进行光合作用的重要部分。因之，在研究植物生长情况的时候，少不了要考虑到它的叶子的面积。特别在研究丰产经验的时候，常要算一下叶面积是多少。
    叶面的形状是以曲线为周界的。当然可以用求面积仪或者用微积分来计算出它的面积来，但在求大量叶面积的时候，不很切合实用，更不要说仪器不凑手或者微积分没学过等问题了。
    植物生理学家经常用一个简捷公式来算：“叶面积等于长乘宽除以1．2”。
    这是一个好公式，但是和一般的经验公式一样，是有它的局限性的，我们将明确地绘出一个直观方法，使人们能一看便知怎样的叶子可以用这个公式，怎样的不行。
    先考虑图中所绘的图形：两个以d为宽，以?为长的长方形，再加上一个以d为底，以?为高的等腰三角形，这样图形的面积等于2?d＋1/2?d＝5/2?d，如果把它设想成为叶子，叶长是3?，宽是d，长乘宽是3?d，是原面积的3÷5/2＝1．2倍。
    这说明了什么？如果叶子大致在2/3的地方“收尖”，这个公式是可以用来估计叶面积的，否则就要重新考虑。在密植的情况下，稻叶的尖部长了，这公式就应当作必要的修改。
    更原则些启示了一个方法，这方法固然可以用来算叶面积，也可以用来估计羊皮面积。就是求经验公式的方法：先量一批羊皮的面积，把每个羊皮的面积除以它的脊长腰围的积，得出一批比值。求这些比值的平均数，命C是这个平均值。如此，便可得经验公式：羊皮的面积等于脊长乘腰围乘上常数C。
    举一而反三，当然不限于算羊皮而已，也不仅限于求面积而已。只注意面积是两个自由度，所以用长宽及一比例系数求得它。同样，体积是三个自由度，可以用长宽高及一比例系数的乘积求得它。
    〔编者附记〕中国科学院数学研究所所长华罗庚同志为本报副刊写的“数学的用场”这个专栏，初步拟定了“怎样计算水库容积”、“怎样调配运输”、“算山坡面积”、“估积谷”、“算草堆”等十多个题目，将陆续发表。
    数学这一门科学，在生产、生活中的应用很广泛。华罗庚同志准备写的这些问题，大部分都是与我国当前的工农业生产和建设有联系的。我们相信“数学的用场”这个专栏将能帮助读者解决实际工作中的一些问题，我们也欢迎读者把工作中所遇到的和数学有关的问题反映给我们。
