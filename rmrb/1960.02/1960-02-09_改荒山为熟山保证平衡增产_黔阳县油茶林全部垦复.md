    Transforming Barren Hills into Fertile Hills, Ensuring Balanced Production Increase
    Qianyang County Completes Renovation of All Oil-Tea Forests
    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 8th – Qianyang County in Hunan Province has basically completed the renovation of over 330,000 mu of oil-tea forests. According to inspection and acceptance, over 90% meet the quality requirements, including over 16,000 mu renovated into terraced gardens, 86,000 mu fully cultivated, and over 210,000 mu cultivated with contour trenches or fish-scale pits. During the renovation, the county reclaimed 25,000 mu of arable wasteland, repaired a number of small reservoirs and canals, and burned a large amount of fire-soil ash.
    Qianyang County had a bumper harvest of oil-tea last year, with production more than doubling compared to 1958. However, the increase in production was very uneven, especially in the more than 180,000 mu of oil-tea forests on barren hills, where the average yield of tea oil per mu was less than half that of ordinary fertile hills. When summarizing the experience of last year's bumper harvest, the Qianyang County Party Committee believed that transforming barren hills into fertile hills and achieving a balanced increase in production was the key to striving for another bumper harvest of oil-tea this year. Therefore, they determined the policy of "comprehensive renovation, pruning and weeding, loosening soil and controlling pests, intercropping grain and trees, accumulating fertilizer and cutting shade, repairing water conservancy, and preparing for field farming," and led the people's communes to launch a campaign to renovate oil-tea forests. For the remote and scattered oil-tea mountains, the people's communes organized professional teams of more than 15,000 people to live on the mountains and carry out the renovation. The First Secretary of the County Party Committee and two members of the Standing Committee of the County Party Committee also led cadres from the organs to conduct an 800-mu high-yield experimental mountain in Xiazhou Commune, implementing deep digging, contour trenching, ditching, pruning, whitewashing, and fertilization, and convened an on-site meeting to summarize and promote experience. Soon, 3,980 cadres and 18,500 commune members in the county started more than 50,000 mu of high-yield oil-tea plots and cultivated more than 80,000 "oil-tea kings."

### 改荒山为熟山保证平衡增产  黔阳县油茶林全部垦复

    改荒山为熟山保证平衡增产
    黔阳县油茶林全部垦复
    新华社长沙8日电　湖南省黔阳县三十三万多亩油茶林的垦复工作已经基本结束。据检查验收，90％以上合乎质量要求，其中做到梯垦园林化的有一万六千多亩，全垦的八万六千亩，带垦作埂或鱼鳞坑垦的二十一万多亩。在垦复中全县共开垦宜农荒地二万五千亩，还整修了一批小型山塘、水渠，烧制了大量火土灰。
    黔阳县去年油茶大丰收，比1958年增产两倍以上。但是，增产很不平衡，特别是十八万多亩荒山油茶林，平均亩产茶油比一般熟山低一半以上。中共黔阳县委在总结去年丰收经验时，认为改荒山为熟山，实现平衡增产，是力争今年油茶大丰收的关键。因此确定了“全面垦复，整枝去杂，松土治虫，粮林间作，积肥砍荫，整修水利，作好山田备耕准备”的方针，领导各人民公社掀起了突击垦复油茶林的运动。对于边远分散的油茶山，各人民公社组织了一万五千多人的专业队，坐山垦复。县委第一书记和两个县委常委还带领机关干部在硖州公社搞了八百亩丰产试验山，实行深挖、作埂、开沟、整枝、刷白、施肥，并且召开现场会，总结推广经验。不久，全县就有三千九百八十个干部和一万八千五百个社员搞起了油茶丰产片五万多亩，培育“油茶王”八万多兜。
