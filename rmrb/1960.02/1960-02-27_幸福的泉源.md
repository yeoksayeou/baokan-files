　　"Springs in every home, willows by every door." This is not an exaggeration when describing Jinan. According to surveys, the total daily outflow from the city's spring groups reaches 200,000 cubic meters. That is to say, in just over a year, it could fill the Ming Tombs Reservoir.
　　Not only in Jinan, but in many other places throughout the country, there are countless springs, both large and small!
　　Springs and mountains often go hand in hand. Springs are most abundant in mountainous areas, especially at the foot of mountains. Jinan is located at the northern edge of Mount Tai, and Xingtai and Huixian at the foot of the Taihang Mountains both boast scenic "hundred springs."
　　Spring water is originally hidden underground, and only emerges when the ground is disrupted, opening a channel for it. In plains areas, a relatively thick layer of sediment and other deposits covers the ground. The terrain is low and flat, and less prone to disruption, so groundwater has fewer opportunities to flow out. Usually, springs are mainly distributed along riverbanks and other places where the ground has been cut. The situation is different in mountainous areas. The elevated terrain makes them a prime target for various natural forces that cause disruption. This disruption results in many valleys and ravines. When these valleys and ravines intersect layers of rock containing groundwater, springs flow out.
　　Some underground rocks are permeable, while others are not. Groundwater is stored in permeable layers. Impermeable layers block the further downward movement of groundwater, so springs often flow out along the contact points between these two types of rock layers. Sandstone is a good permeable layer, while clay, shale, and many igneous rocks, such as granite, are impermeable.
　　However, do not assume that areas with only igneous rock have no springs. Igneous rocks often develop many fissures during solidification due to contraction. These fissures can store water and allow springs to flow along them.
　　The erosion of rocks by wind, water, sunlight, etc., can also create fissures. In limestone, these fissures enlarge into caves because the rock is easily dissolved, storing especially large amounts of water. The springs that emerge from these caves are often quite large. Jinan's abundant springs come from limestone. The famous Black Tiger Spring is a fissure spring, while the Baotu, Golden Thread, and Pearl Springs are formed because the terrain there is lower than the groundwater level. According to surveys, there are also some impermeable igneous rock formations interspersed underground in the Jinan area, hindering the continued northward flow of groundwater, thus making the springs here even more abundant.
　　When the earth's crust moves, causing faulting and displacement of rock layers, groundwater often flows out along the fault planes. The springs of Jade Spring Mountain in Beijing are formed in this way.
　　Because water flows downhill, high mountains serve as a water source, and springs are often found in low-lying areas within the mountains and at the foot of mountains. Although some groundwater does not move according to the principle of water flowing downhill—it is hidden in a permeable layer sandwiched between two impermeable layers, like water in a tap—it is still subject to the pressure of the water source and forms an artesian spring. However, it still requires a high mountain as a water tower to supply it.
　　According to the above, there should also be many springs in plains areas, because they are the lowest-lying. The problem is that natural forces have not cut the ground enough. But what if we do not rely on nature and dig into the ground ourselves? Then we can obtain a large amount of artificial spring water—well water.
　　Spring water is good drinking water. "Spring water is clear in the mountains, but turbid when it leaves the mountains." Freshly emerging spring water is the cleanest water in nature. It has been found in some springs that there are only eighteen bacteria per cubic centimeter of water, while the same volume of seawater contains as many as 70,000 bacteria. This is because the spring water has traveled long distances through the rocks, as if filtered through countless filter devices even more thorough than sand tanks. It is said that China's spring water is best exemplified by the Jade Spring in Beijing, hence the title "First Spring Under Heaven". The "Second Spring" is the spring water of Huishan in Wuxi.
　　Spring water is not only used for drinking, but is also an important water source for industrial and agricultural production. But in the past, the reactionary rulers only knew how to occupy famous springs for their own enjoyment. Only after liberation, under the leadership of the Party, has large-scale spring seeking, well digging, and spring water utilization work been carried out. In Henan Province alone, more than 140,000 wells were dug and more than 9,000 artesian springs were discovered between October and December last year. In last year's drought resistance efforts, many already utilized springs throughout the country played a significant role. The Party is the true wellspring of happiness! If springs had consciousness, they would also feel happy to be able to fully play their role today.

    幸福的泉源
    石工
      “家家泉水，户户垂杨。”这对济南来说，不是夸张的描写，据调查，全城泉群每日涌出的水量达到二十万公方。也就是说，一年多的时间就能将十三陵水库灌满。
    不仅在济南，便是在全国其他许多地方，大大小小的泉水也何止万千！
    泉和山常常伴随在一起，在山中特别是在山前地区泉源最多。济南就正位于泰山的北缘，而太行山前的邢台、辉县都有“百泉”胜景。
    泉水本来藏在地下，只有当地面被破坏给它打开一条通道时才会涌出。在平原地区复盖着比较厚的泥沙等堆积物，地势低平，受到破坏较少，地下水没有很多流出来的机会。通常泉源主要分布在河岸等地面被切割的地方。在山区，情况就不同了，地势凸起，成为各种自然力进行破坏的重要目标。破坏的结果造成了许多山谷沟壑。这些山谷沟壑截过含有地下水的岩层时，泉水就流出来了。
    地下的岩石有的能透水，有的不能。地下水是储存在透水层中的，由于不透水层阻挡了地下水继续向下运动，泉水常沿这两种岩层接触的地方流出来。砂岩是良好的透水层，而粘土、页岩和许多火成岩如花岗岩是不透水的。
    但是不要以为全是火成岩分布的地区便没有泉，火成岩在凝结的时候因为收缩常常产生了许多裂罅，这些裂罅能储水也能让泉水沿着它流出。
      由于风、水、阳光等对岩石的破坏，也能造成裂罅，在石灰岩中因它易被溶解，裂罅扩大成了洞穴，储水特别多，从这些洞穴中涌出的泉水也常常很大。济南丰富的泉水就是从石灰岩中来的。著名的黑虎泉就是一个裂隙泉，而趵突、金线、珍珠等名泉则是因为那里的地势下凹到低于地下水面而形成的。据调查，济南一带的地下还有些不透水的火成岩体穿插其间，阻碍着地下水的继续北流，因而使这里的泉源更加旺盛。
    在地壳发生运动，使岩层产生断裂错动的时候，地下水往往会沿着断裂面流出，北京玉泉山的泉水就是这样形成的。
    由于水往低处流，高山成为供水的地方，而山中低凹处及山前常多泉源。尽管有些地下水不按水往低处流的道理运动，它藏在被两个不透水层夹着的透水层中间，就像水进了自来水管，这时受着水源压力的影响而运动，形成自流泉，但是仍然需要高山作为供水的水塔。
    照上面的情况看来，平原地区也应该有很多泉水的，因为地势最低。问题在于自然力对地面切割得不够，但是如果我们不依靠自然，自己向地下挖下去呢？这时我们能够得到大量的人工的泉水——井水。
    泉水是良好的饮水，“在山泉水清，出山泉水浊。”刚涌出的泉水是自然界中最干净的水，曾经有人在有的泉水中发现，每一立方厘米水中只有十八个细菌，而同样体积的海水中有多到七万个细菌。这因为泉水在岩石中作了长途旅行，就像经过无数比砂缸更为严密的滤水器滤过一样。据说我国的泉水以北京的玉泉为最好，因此有“天下第一泉”之称，“第二泉”是无锡惠山的泉水。
    泉水不仅用于饮用，还是工农业生产的重要水源。但过去反动统治者只知霸占名泉供自己享用，只有在解放后在党的领导下才开展了大规模找泉挖泉和利用泉水的工作，仅河南省在去年10月至12月间就打井十四万多眼，挖自流泉九千多处。在去年的抗旱中，全国各处许多已经利用的泉水发挥了重大的作用。党才是真正的幸福泉源！如泉源有知，它也应为能在今天充分发挥自己的作用而感到幸福。
