Editorial Note:

Good news has arrived that Hungary's agricultural collectivization movement has reached a new high tide. Currently, 70% of the country's villages and towns have achieved collectivization, and socialist components account for 70% of the total cultivated land area. This is a major victory for the socialist transformation of Hungarian agriculture.

Last spring, a remarkable high tide of collectivization emerged in the Hungarian countryside. By the end of last year, over 40% of the country's villages and towns had achieved collectivization, and socialist components accounted for 55.8% of the cultivated land area. Now, just over a month later, this percentage has soared again, and the face of the countryside has undergone tremendous changes. The development of Hungary's agricultural collectivization movement has once again proven that the socialist transformation of agriculture is in the fundamental interests of the broad masses of peasants, and therefore, under the correct leadership of the Party, it is entirely possible to develop rapidly on a broad scale. This is something that no imperialist or revisionist can ever stop.

    喜讯
    喜讯传来，匈牙利农业合作化运动出现了新的高潮，目前全国已有百分之七十的村镇实现了合作化，社会主义成分已占耕地总面积的百分之七十。这是匈牙利农业社会主义改造的重大胜利。
    去年春天，匈牙利农村曾经出现了引人注目的合作化高潮。到去年年底，全国有百分之四十以上的村镇实现了合作化，社会主义成分占了耕地面积的百分之五十五点八。现在时间才过了一个多月，这个百分比又飞跃上升，农村的面貌又发生了巨大的变化。匈牙利农业合作化运动的发展，又一次证明了农业社会主义改造是符合广大农民的根本利益的，因而在党的正确领导下，有一切可能以广阔的规模发展得很快。这是任何帝国主义者和修正主义者所永远阻挡不了的。
