Demand Transportation Capacity from Technological Revolution
Du Shuqing, First Secretary of the CPC Luzhou Municipal Committee, Sichuan Province

Two Ideologies, Two Methods

Luzhou Port is a medium-sized port located at the confluence of the Yangtze and Tuo Rivers, serving as a transit hub for a considerable amount of materials from southern Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. The port handles a significant volume of cargo. However, before the port achieved partial mechanization, the loading, unloading, and handling conditions were not adapted to the situation of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture. More than 80% of the city's three thousand stevedores used the backward method of carrying by shoulder pole, resulting in low efficiency and high labor intensity. The method of "ants moving Mount Tai" was often used for night battles and surprise attacks, but there were still frequent occurrences of vehicle and vessel congestion and material accumulation, which affected production and made the majority of workers urgently demand a change in the labor conditions of "staggering uphill and downhill, clothes soaked with sweat." Obviously, transportation had become a problem that urgently needed to be solved in Luzhou's continued comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1959.

In the process of solving the above problems and realizing semi-mechanization and mechanization of the port and docks, there was a struggle between two ideologies and two methods. The victory of technological transformation was the victory of ideological struggle. As Chairman Mao said: "The working class should transform the whole society in the struggle of class struggle and the struggle against nature, and at the same time transform itself." ("On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People")

In the entire process of technological transformation, we organized five debates of principle significance according to the development of the movement.

On the method of solving the contradiction that the loading and unloading capacity could not adapt to the sharp increase in freight volume, some comrades advocated continuing the "people's war" and organizing hard work for surprise attacks. These comrades did not realize that although the continuous growth of socialist production can rely on two sources: first, by increasing the number of workers; second, by increasing labor productivity. In fact, according to the situation of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture in Luzhou, if we continue to rely on shoulder carrying, we would have to add at least three thousand more laborers to complete the 1959 transportation task. Obviously, this method is not in line with the spirit of the General Line and is fundamentally unfeasible. They do not understand, or do not fully understand, that relying on the people's war and enthusiasm alone, production leap forward cannot be sustained and consolidated. The municipal party committee believes that only by vigorously launching mass movements, vigorously engaging in technological innovation and technological revolution, and rapidly improving the labor productivity of handling and loading and unloading, can be the only correct path. At the same time, failing to pay attention to technological revolution, ignoring the strong desire of the broad masses of workers to build the motherland at high speed, and their demands to get rid of backward production methods and heavy physical labor, is a concrete manifestation of lacking a mass viewpoint. Therefore, the municipal party committee criticized the above-mentioned wrong ideas, and incorporated the comprehensive transformation of existing docks and the complete elimination of shoulder carrying into the twenty-point program (draft) for the industrial leap forward in 1959, and loudly proposed: "Demand labor force from technological revolution."

Secondly, there was the debate between advanced and conservative ideas in the technological transformation movement. Among the stevedores, some people did not believe that semi-mechanization and mechanization of loading and unloading could be successful, and held a skeptical and wait-and-see attitude. In response to this idea, we vigorously promoted the benefits of indigenous machinery. We used successful examples of indigenous machinery to continuously educate and dispel their ideological concerns, promote the communist style of daring to think and act, and advocate that we can definitely do what others can do, and we must create what does not exist in the world, and educate the masses to believe in their own strength.

After the problem of large-scale technological transformation of ports and docks was solved, a debate arose on the method of innovation between indigenous methods and foreign methods. This struggle is also a debate between relying on self-reliance or relying on the state in the technological revolution. Some comrades were greedy for big and foreign projects in innovation, and belittled small and indigenous ones, thinking that "indigenous methods do not solve problems, and if we want to do it, we must do it with foreign methods." They did not realize that "indigenous" is the foundation of "foreign," and "foreign" is the continuation of "indigenous." Moreover, at the beginning of 1959, the national economy was in a comprehensive leap forward, and in order to ensure the country's key construction projects, iron, wood, and electrical materials were temporarily in short supply, and objective conditions required us to focus on indigenous methods. Facts have proved that under the specific conditions at that time, only indigenous methods could be launched first, in order to ensure the high-speed realization of semi-mechanization and mechanization of ports and docks.

To realize semi-mechanization and mechanization of ports and docks, is it the sole task of the transportation department to fight alone, or coordinated action and mobilization of the whole people? There were two ideological debates on this issue. Some comrades in the material department thought that the technological transformation of ports and docks was the responsibility of the transportation department and "had nothing to do with them"; some comrades in the transportation department were afraid that after the realization of indigenous mechanization, the material department would reduce freight rates and affect income. They did not realize that all transportation undertakings and industrial construction are the common undertakings of the socialist family, and they are all creating wealth for socialism; and such arduous and heavy construction tasks can only be completed faster and better if everyone is of one mind, cooperates with each other, and mobilizes the whole people.

Realizing semi-mechanization and mechanization of ports and docks, like any new work, has a process of gradually accumulating experience. In the process of development, it is impossible to have no shortcomings. In the initial stage of realizing indigenous mechanization in our city's ports and docks, some places experienced some temporary difficulties in use due to lack of experience or imperfect construction. For example, some indigenous machines were not flexible enough at the beginning, and some could not adapt to the complex situations of rising and falling water levels and changing materials. This was originally a very natural thing. However, some people did not actively try to overcome the shortcomings of new things in the process of growth and support the healthy growth of new things; instead, they spread negative and pessimistic emotions, and let it go, saying: "Indigenous machines have low transport capacity and many problems, so it is better to withdraw as soon as possible and avoid trouble." We also carried out a resolute struggle against this idea.

In the process of the above-mentioned struggle between two ideologies and two methods, we adopted methods such as "speaking," "debating," "calculating," and "watching," focusing on carrying out education on the situation, education on the future, and education on the communist style to the workers. That is, vigorously speaking to the workers about the leap forward situation and the glorious and arduous tasks facing the transportation department, and organizing the workers to carry out special debates on "the relationship between transportation and industry, agriculture, and commerce," "is it feasible for production to develop greatly and rely on people carrying on their backs for a long time," and "how to change the backward situation of loading and unloading." Secondly, we fully mobilized the masses to calculate the political and economic accounts of improving work efficiency, speeding up vehicle and vessel turnover and material circulation, saving labor, and reducing labor intensity. Thirdly, we organized on-site visits and convened on-site meetings, using advanced examples to continuously educate and criticize backward and conservative ideas. Therefore, we quickly cleared ideological obstacles, boosted the enthusiasm of the masses, and effectively promoted the progress of the movement.

Strengthen Leadership, Mobilize the Whole People, and Strive for High Speed of Technological Transformation

After the masses are mobilized, the leadership must stand at the forefront of the movement, organize the strength of the masses, correctly handle the cooperative relationship between the transportation department and the material department, adapt to the historical characteristics of small and medium-sized ports and docks with long lines, wide areas, and many points, and fully consider the long-term planning of transforming ports and docks. During the construction period, the city established a command for indigenous mechanization of ports and docks. The secretary personally took charge, and adopted the method of unified leadership, overall planning, division of responsibility, and unit responsibility. It was stipulated that all special roads and tools inside factories, enterprises, and warehouses should be the responsibility of each unit, all lines and equipment of ports and docks should be the responsibility of the transportation department, and public lines should be the joint responsibility of relevant units, fully mobilizing the masses and completing the task within a limited time. As a result, ninety-eight relevant units in the city quickly joined the movement, working together with one heart and one mind and going all out.

Throughout the entire movement, we have always attached importance to the vertical and horizontal cooperation of the transportation department, the material department, and other aspects, and based the cooperation on improving the communist consciousness of the broad masses of cadres and workers and their conscious understanding of the close relationship between industry, agriculture, transportation, and commerce, with the main content of cooperation being to solve the problems of manpower, materials, and funds in construction with concerted efforts and self-reliance. The main forms of cooperation were: contracting (division of responsibility), communication (mutual exchange of materials), addition (active processing), donation (conscious donation), and borrowing (temporary borrowing). Facts have proved that "cooperation is strength," and many difficult problems can be solved once they are cooperated.

In order to continuously push the technological transformation movement to a climax and continuously consolidate the labor enthusiasm of the workers, we have successively launched "five comparisons" (comparing enthusiasm, comparing speed, comparing quality, comparing more rationalization proposals, comparing more innovation projects) and "six comparisons" (comparing more vehicle construction, comparing faster installation, comparing timely use, comparing skilled operation, comparing good quality, comparing high transport efficiency) between slices and slices, points and points, people and people, according to the different stages and requirements of the movement, as well as counterpart competitions between machines and machines; and organized activities such as assault days, assault weeks, and assault ten days. We adopted the method of checking every three days and evaluating every seven days, and held on-site meetings in a timely manner to summarize and exchange experiences, and set off a heat wave of competition among units and workers to catch up with each other, which greatly promoted the in-depth development of the movement.

According to the law that the relations of production must be adapted to the productive forces, with the in-depth development of the technological transformation movement of ports and docks, we started to strengthen the management of loading and unloading and handling of ports and docks from the following aspects. First, the city established a port and dock management committee, formulated management methods, reasonably arranged the layout of indigenous machinery according to the distribution of cargo sources, delineated twenty-four loading and unloading docks in the city, expanded and established six freight yards, and planned the unloading points for various materials, changing the natural state of ships stopping everywhere along the riverbank in the past and the chaotic situation of unloading goods along the road and piling them up in a disorderly manner, effectively giving play to the role of loading and unloading machinery. Second, a production responsibility system was established, implementing "five fixings" (fixed tasks, fixed personnel, fixed points and lines, fixed time, fixed responsibility), "three guarantees" (guaranteed use, guaranteed management, guaranteed improvement), and adopting a combination of fixed-point contracting and flexible mobilization according to the characteristics of dock cargo transportation. This not only strengthened the workers' sense of responsibility, but also allowed for flexible mobilization and avoided waste of labor. Third, plan management was strengthened, and the allocation system was improved to eliminate the phenomenon of wrong allocation and return empty. Fourth, the unreasonable wage system was reformed, replacing the old commission wage system with a new quota piece-rate wage system, which promoted the use and consolidation and improvement of indigenous mechanization. At the same time, forms such as on-site performances, signing master-apprentice contracts, and running red and expert schools were also adopted, with the method of speaking, teaching, experimenting, and promoting at the same time, to train a large number of technical workers.

From Indigenous to Foreign, Combining Indigenous and Foreign, Gradually Developing, and Continuously Improving

Before December of last year, the semi-mechanization and mechanization of our city's ports and docks were basically in the "small indigenous groups" stage. This was because materials such as steel and electrical equipment could not be solved temporarily at that time, and foreign methods could not be implemented, so we could only engage in iron-wood structure indigenous machinery with human and animal power as the main driving force. At that time, the indigenous method was in the leading aspect of the contradiction. Only by focusing on indigenous methods and launching indigenous methods first, could we rely on self-reliance to make a batch of indigenous machines and tools by surprise, realize the initial technological transformation of ports and docks, and alleviate the contradiction between transportation capacity and the growth of freight volume, and lay a preliminary foundation for the comprehensive technological transformation of ports and docks. However, we cannot absolutize "indigenous" and think that only "indigenous" is good, which is wrong. Because "indigenous" will always be transformed into "foreign," and as long as there are conditions, we should engage in foreign methods if we can.

Since December of last year, the technological transformation of our city's ports and docks has gradually transitioned to "small foreign groups" mainly driven by electricity. This is a leap in the process of semi-mechanization and mechanization of our city's ports and docks. This leap is due to the current situation and the following conditions: (1) After the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee was implemented, it promoted a comprehensive new upsurge in the national economy; the policy of developing the national economy based on agriculture requires the transportation industry to accelerate development without increasing personnel or even reducing personnel, in order to keep up with the pace of the Great Leap Forward. "Small indigenous groups" can no longer meet the new needs, and "small foreign groups" are imperative; (2) After the realization of indigenous mechanization of loading and unloading at ports and docks, it not only laid a material foundation for the realization of "small foreign groups," but also vividly demonstrated the unlimited vitality of "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups," and effectively mobilized the masses to fight for "small foreign groups," laying an ideological foundation for the realization of "small foreign groups"; (3) The victory of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1959 provided material conditions for the realization of "small foreign groups" in terms of raw materials and power equipment. According to the above situation, foreign methods have been in the leading position of the contradiction, and we must implement the principle of self-reliance and combining foreign and indigenous methods. Failure to do so will affect the high speed of technological transformation of ports and docks, and will not be able to adapt to the new requirements put forward by the comprehensive continued leap forward in 1960 for the transportation department. However, "foreign" is the continuation of "indigenous," and "indigenous" is the foundation of "foreign." Therefore, when realizing "small foreign groups," we must carefully summarize the experiences and lessons of "small indigenous groups," and pay attention to retaining indigenous machines with good results, and further transform them when necessary. On the other hand, "foreign" is not absolute. Today's "foreign" will become tomorrow's "indigenous." Therefore, when realizing "small foreign groups," we must also have a longer-term perspective. According to long-term planning, and the current distribution, collection, flow and direction of materials, we should strive to make the layout of loading and unloading machinery more reasonable, and build some relatively permanent fixed backbone foreign machines where conditions permit.

According to the above spirit, we have also established the following principles in the specific practice of technological transformation to guide the rapid development of semi-mechanization and mechanization of ports and docks.

1.  Engage in foreign methods if possible, and gradually transform: Generally, docks in key factory areas with more materials should be foreign methods first, and general areas later; areas with good conditions should be foreign methods first, and areas with poor conditions later; uphill should be foreign methods first, and downhill later.
2.  Adapt to local conditions and make equipment according to materials: In the construction of the type of loading and unloading machinery, it should generally be determined according to the principles of water level changes, slope size, material types, and amount of transportation.
3.  Persist in use and continuously improve: Because we must "discover the truth through practice, and then confirm and develop the truth through practice" ("On Practice"), only by persisting in use can we continuously improve. We regard persistence in use as a principle. We are only allowed to use, not to abolish. In the process of use, we continuously improve equipment, lines, layout, and other aspects.

At present, a vigorous, solid, and large-scale construction upsurge of "small foreign groups" in ports and docks in our city has been formed. The "small foreign groups" mainly driven by electricity will soon be fully realized. It is estimated that the transportation efficiency will be increased by ten to thirty times, and the total loading and unloading operation volume of the port can reach about 40,000 to 50,000 tons, which is two to three times higher than the current level. However, with the high-speed leap forward of industrial and agricultural production and the opening of the Longzhu Railway, the opening of giant passenger ships, and the increasing development of air transportation, it will inevitably bring more arduous and glorious tasks to the loading and unloading and handling of our city's ports and docks. It is estimated that the daily loading and unloading volume of the entire port will be around 100,000 tons. Therefore, we must hold high the red flag of continuous revolution and continuous leap forward on the basis of the achievements we have already made, and strive to thoroughly realize the systematization and mechanization of the loading and unloading and handling of ports and docks.

    向技术革命要运力
    中共四川省泸州市委第一书记　杜树青
    两种思想，两种方法
    泸州港是处于长沱两江汇合口的一个中型港口，是川南云贵相当数量物资的中转区，港口货运量较大。但在未实现港口土机械化以前，我市装卸搬运状况与工农业大跃进的形势极不适应，全市三千多搬运工人，80％以上使用挑抬的落后运输方法，效率低，劳动强度大。当时常用“蚂蚁搬泰山”的办法夜战突击，但仍常有车船堵塞和物资积压现象，既影响了生产，广大职工也迫切要求改变那种“上坡下坎脚打颤，汗流浃背湿衣衫”的劳动状态。显然，交通运输已成为我市1959年继续全面大跃进中迫切需要解决的问题。
    在解决上述问题、实现港口码头半机械化、机械化的过程中，存在着两种思想，两种方法的斗争。而实现技术改造的胜利，也就是思想斗争的胜利。正如毛主席所说：“工人阶级要在阶级斗争和向自然界的斗争中改造整个社会，同时也就改造自己。”（“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”）
    在整个技术改造的过程中，我们根据运动的发展，组织了五场具有原则意义的争论。
    在解决装卸搬运力量不能适应货运量激增的矛盾的办法上，有的同志主张还是继续“打人海战术”，组织苦战突击。这些同志没有认识到，虽然社会主义生产的不断增长可以依靠两个泉源：第一，是靠增加工作者人数；第二，是靠提高劳动生产率。事实上，根据我市工农业全面大跃进的情况，如果继续依靠肩挑人抬，要完成1959年的运输任务就得至少增加三千多个劳动力。显然这种办法是不符合总路线的精神，也是根本行不通的。他们不懂得或不完全懂得依靠人海战术，光凭热情，生产跃进是不可能持久和巩固的。市委认为，只有大搞群众运动，大闹技术革新和技术革命，迅速提高搬运装卸的劳动生产率，才是唯一正确的道路。同时，不重视技术革命，无视广大职工群众高速度建设祖国的强烈愿望和摆脱落后生产方式与繁重体力劳动的要求，就是缺乏群众观点的具体表现。因此，市委批判了上述错误思想，把全面改造现有码头、彻底消灭肩挑人抬，订入了1959年工业跃进二十条纲要（草案），并响亮地提出：“向技术革命要劳动力”。
    其次，是技术改造运动中的先进思想与保守思想之争。在搬运工人中，有的人不相信装卸搬运搞半机械化、机械化能成功，抱着怀疑观望的态度。针对这种思想，我们大力宣扬了土机械的好处。用土机械成功的事例不断进行教育，解除他们的思想顾虑，发扬敢想敢干的共产主义风格，提倡别人能做到的事情我们也一定能做到，世界上没有的事情，我们也要创造，教育群众相信自己的力量。
    在港口码头必须大搞技术改造的问题解决之后，在革新的方法上又产生了土法与洋法之争。这场斗争也是技术革命依靠自力更生还是依赖国家的两种态度的争论。有的同志在革新项目上贪大贪洋，轻小轻土，认为“搞土的不解决问题，要搞就要搞洋的”。他们没有认识到“土”是“洋”的基础，“洋”则是“土”的继续。而且1959年初国民经济全面跃进，为了保证国家重点建设，铁、木材和电器材料暂时比较紧张，客观条件要求我们必须以土为主。事实证明，在当时的具体条件下，只有土法先上马，才能保证港口码头半机械化、机械化高速度实现。
    实现港口码头半机械化、机械化，是单凭运输部门孤军作战，还是协同动作，全民动手，在这个问题上也有两种思想的争论。物资部门中有的同志认为，港口码头技术改造是交通运输部门的事，“与己无关”；运输部门中有的同志怕土机械化实现之后，物资部门要降低运价，影响收入。他们没有认识到一切交通运输事业、工业建设都是社会主义大家庭的共同事业，都是为社会主义创造财富；而且这样艰巨繁重的建设任务，也只有大家同心同德，协作配合，全民动手，才能更快更好地完成。
    实现港口码头半机械化、机械化和进行任何新的工作一样，都有一个逐步积累经验的过程，在发展过程中，不可能没有一点缺点。我市港口码头在实现土机械化的初期，有些地方因为缺乏经验，或者因为建设不完善，在使用上发生了一些暂时的困难。如部分土机械开始还不够灵巧，有的还不能适应水位涨落、物资变化的复杂情况。这本来是很自然的事情。但有的人对新生事物在成长过程中产生的缺点不是积极设法加以克服，扶持新生事物健康地成长壮大；而是散布消极否定情绪，放任不管，说：“土机械运量少，问题多，不如趁早收兵，少讨麻烦。”我们对这种思想也进行了坚决的斗争。
    在上述两种思想、两种方法的斗争过程中，我们采取了“讲”“辩”“算”“看”等办法，着重向职工进行了形势教育，前途教育，共产主义风格的教育。即向职工大讲跃进形势与交通运输部门面临的光荣艰巨任务，组织职工开展“交通运输与工、农、商业的关系”，“生产大发展，长期人背肩挑行不行”，“如何改变装卸搬运落后面貌”等专题大辩论。其次，充分发动群众算提高工效，加速车船周转和物资流通，节约劳力减轻劳动强度等政治账和经济账。第三，组织现场参观，召开现场会议，用先进事例不断教育和批判落后保守思想。因此，迅速扫清了思想障碍，鼓舞了群众干劲，有力地推动了运动的进展。
    加强领导，全民动手，力争技术改造的高速度
    在群众发动起来后，领导必须站在运动的最前列，组织好群众力量，正确地处理好交通运输部门与物资部门的协作配合关系，适应中小型港口码头线长、面宽、点多的历史特点，充分考虑到改造港口码头的长远规划。在建设时期，全市成立了港口码头土机械化指挥部。书记亲自挂帅，采取了统一领导、全面规划、分片包干、单位负责的办法。规定凡工厂、企业、仓库内部的专用道路和工具，由各单位自行负责，凡港口码头的线路与设备，由交通运输部门负责，公用线路由有关单位共同负责，充分发动群众，限期包干完成。因而使全市九十八个有关单位迅速地投入到运动中来，同心协力，全力以赴。
    在整个运动中，我们一直重视了运输部门、物资部门等各方面的纵横协作，把协作建立在提高广大干部和职工共产主义觉悟与对工、农、交、商密切关系的自觉认识基础之上，以同心协力，自力更生，解决建设中的人力、物力、资金问题作为主要的协作内容。在协作形式上主要采取了：包（分片包干）、通（互通有无）、加（主动加工）、捐（自觉捐献）、借（暂时借用）的办法。事实证明“协作就是力量”，许多困难问题一经协作就迎刃而解。
    为了不断把技术改造运动推向高潮，持续巩固职工的劳动热情，我们根据运动发展的不同阶段与要求，先后开展了片与片、点与点、人与人之间的“五比”（比干劲足，比进度快，比质量高，比合理化建议多，比革新项目多）和“六比”（比造车多，比安装快，比使用及时，比操作熟练，比质量好，比运效高）竞赛，以及同机具与同机具的对口赛；并组织突击日，突击周，突击旬等活动。采取三天一检查，七天一评比的办法，及时召开现场会议，总结交流经验，在单位与职工中掀起了你追我赶的竞赛热潮，大大推动了运动的深入发展。
    根据生产关系和生产力相适应的规律，随着港口码头的技术改造运动深入发展，我们从以下几个方面着手加强了港口码头装卸搬运的管理工作。首先，全市成立了港口码头管理委员会，制定了管理办法，根据货源的分布，合理地安排了土机械的布局，在全市划定了二十四个装卸码头，扩大和建立了六个货场，规划了各类物资的起卸点，改变了过去沿江港岸到处停船的自然状态和汽车沿路卸货，乱堆乱放的混乱局面，有力地发挥了装卸机械的作用。其次，建立了生产责任制度，实行了“五定”（定任务，定人员，定点线，定时间，定责任）、“三包”（包使用，包管理，包改进），并根据码头货运特点，采取定点包干和灵活调动相结合的办法。既加强了工人的责任感，又能灵活调动，避免劳动力的浪费。第三，加强计划管理，改进调配制度，消灭错调返空的现象。第四，改革不合理的工资制度，以新的定额计件工资制代替旧的提成工资制，促进了土机械化的使用和巩固提高。同时，还采取现场表演，订立师徒合同，大办红专学校等形式，以边说、边教、边试验和边推广的办法，大量培养技术工人。
    由土到洋，土洋并举，逐步发展，不断提高
    在去年12月以前，我市港口码头的半机械化、机械化基本上是处于“小土群”阶段。这是由于当时钢材、电动设备等材料暂时还不能解决，洋的上不去，只能搞以人力、畜力为主要动力的铁木结构土机械。当时，土法是处于矛盾的主导方面，只有以土为主，土法先上马，才能依靠自力更生，突击制成一批土机具，实现港口码头的初步技术改造，以缓和运力与运量增长不相适应的矛盾，为港口码头的全面技术改造打下初步基础。但是不能把“土”绝对化起来，以为只有“土”才好，这是错误的。因为“土”总是要向“洋”转化，只要有条件，能搞洋的就搞洋的。
    从去年12月起，我市港口码头技术改造就开始逐步向以电动为主的“小洋群”过渡。这是我市港口码头半机械化、机械化过程中的一次飞跃，这个飞跃是由于当前形势和以下条件产生的：（1）八届八中全会精神贯彻后，促进了国民经济的全面新高涨；以农业为基础的国民经济发展的方针，要求交通运输事业在不增加人还要减人的情况下加速发展，跟上大跃进的步伐，“小土群”已不能满足新的需要，“小洋群”势在必行；（2）港口码头装卸搬运土机械化实现后，不但为实现“小洋群”奠定了物质基础，而且事实生动地表明了“小土群”、“小洋群”的无限生命力，有力地动员了群众为“小洋群”而战，为实现“小洋群”奠定了思想基础；（3）1959年全面大跃进的胜利，从原材料和动力设备等方面为实现“小洋群”提供了物质条件。根据以上情况，洋法已经处于矛盾的主导地位，必须贯彻自力更生、洋土并举的原则。不如此，就会影响港口码头技术改造的高速度，也不可能适应1960年全面继续跃进向交通运输部门提出的新要求。但“洋”是“土”的继续，“土”是“洋”的基础，因此，在实现“小洋群”的时候，必须认真总结“小土群”的经验教训，并注意保留效果良好的土机械，待必要时再进一步改造。另方面“洋”也不是绝对的，今日之“洋”会成为明日之“土”，因此，在实现“小洋群”的时候，也要作更远的展望。根据长远规划，与当前物资的散集和流量流向，力求装卸机械布局更加合理，有条件的地方还要建设一些较永久固定的骨干洋机械。
    根据上述精神，我们在技术改造的具体实践中还确立了以下原则，以指导港口码头半机械化、机械化的迅速开展。
    一、能洋则洋，逐步改造：一般应该是物资较多的重点工厂地区码头先洋，一般地区后洋；条件好的地区先洋，条件差的后洋；上坡先洋，下坡后洋。
    二、因地制宜，因物制器：在修建装卸搬运机械的类型上，一般应根据水位变化、坡度大小、物资种类、运量多少的原则确定。
    三、坚持使用，不断提高；因为要“通过实践而发现真理，又通过实践而证实真理和发展真理。”（“实践论”），因此只有坚持使用才能不断改进。我们把必须坚持使用作为一条原则，只准用，不准废，在使用过程中，对设备、线路、布局等方面不断进行改进。
    目前我市一个轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实、大闹港口码头“小洋群”的建设高潮已经形成。以电动为主的“小洋群”即将全部实现，预计运效将提高十到三十倍，全港装卸搬运操作量即可达四到五万吨左右，比现在提高二到三倍。但随着工农业生产高速度跃进和隆筑铁路通车，巨型客轮通航，以及空运日益发展，必将为我市港口码头装卸搬运带来更加繁重而光荣的任务，预计全港日装卸搬运量必将在十万吨左右。因此，我们要在已经取得的成绩的基础上，高举不断革命、不断跃进的红旗，为彻底实现港口码头装卸搬运系统化、机械化而奋斗。
