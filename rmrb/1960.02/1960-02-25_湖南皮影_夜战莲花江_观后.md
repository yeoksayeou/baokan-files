    Since liberation, shadow play art has received strong support from the Party, allowing it to revive and flourish. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, the direction of shadow play art serving the general line and socialist construction has become even clearer. Encouraged by the situation of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, shadow play art is also experiencing a Great Leap Forward. Here, I want to recommend the Hunan comrades' performance of "Night Battle on Lotus River" to the audience.
    Before the curtain rises, a majestic song resounds in the theater:
    Rowing wooden boats on the water,
    Chasing each other to seize the lead,
    Single-mindedly forging steel,
    Like a Dragon Boat Race at the Dragon Boat Festival.
    The song stirred the hearts of the entire audience. Then the curtain opened, and a fleet of boats filled with pig iron advanced continuously on the rolling Lotus River. This scene is a long shot, and the audience cannot see the people, but the fleet of boats and the song immediately bring the audience into the hot scene of the Great Leap Forward in steelmaking in 1958. "Night Battle on Lotus River" reflects the heroic figures of our great era: a group of young girls, in order to prevent the steel plant from shutting down due to insufficient fuel supply, borrow boats from the older wooden boat team leader, Bao Die, to transport coal. Bao Die agrees to lend them the boats, but does not believe that they can row through the three dangerous shoals on the Lotus River, and wants to call young lads to row the boats. However, the girls are very enthusiastic, and they persuade Bao Die to fight the Lotus River at night with them, and finally overcome many difficulties and transport the coal to the steel plant on time.
    The plot of the play is relatively simple; however, the actors' full political enthusiasm and skillful techniques are not diminished by the simple plot. On the contrary, the characteristics of shadow play art are fully utilized to highlight the theme and characters even more.
    The first scene mentioned above fully demonstrates the characteristics of shadow play art. In front of the Chinese painting-style scenery, countless small boats are moving; due to perspective, the boats are of different sizes, so the picture does not appear rigid. In particular, the rhythm of the boat movement is distinct, the closer ones are faster, the farther ones are slower, and the farthest ones are barely moving, thus making the picture very lively. Coupled with the music and singing with rich Hunan local characteristics, it is majestic and inspiring. People have forgotten that they are watching a shadow play, and the small shadow window cannot lock people's imagination. You can stretch the picture out, as if you see an infinitely broad space, and think of the heroic spirit of our great country and great people.
    Then, when Bao Die, after working hard for a day and a night, is leaning on a haystack to sleep for a while, the girls come to find him. Seeing him asleep, they want to joke with him, so they use rice straw to poke his nostrils and wake him up. Bao Die jumps up all of a sudden, very angry, and kicks away a very large haystack with one foot. This action makes the girls laugh, and also amuses the audience. In this laughter, the characters of Bao Die and the girls, as well as their relationship, are vividly expressed. Exaggerated and reasonable actions compensate for the defect that the shadow figures' faces cannot express emotions. This is an important expression technique of shadow play.
    Let's look at the scene when the boat passes through Ghost Gate Pass: the river is turbulent and the boat is bumping and swaying on the water; however, the people on the boat are not panicked at all. No matter how big the wind and waves are, they still row the boat forward with uniform movements. At this time, the neat and powerful rowing movements on the shadow window, coupled with the firm singing and the bumping boat, rolling waves, form a strong contrast. We deeply feel that people's firm will can withstand any storm.
    The dangerous shoals have passed, and the boat is running on the calm lake. The girls are gently rowing their oars, excitedly looking into the distance, the destination is approaching. They cannot hide the joy in their hearts. Bao Die lies at the stern, steering the boat, looking up at the blue sky, and he is also fantasizing. What are they thinking? At this time, a short but very interesting dialogue unfolds on the boat. The girl asks Bao Die if he is convinced? "Can girls beat men?" Bao Die, as if he had just been awakened from sleeping by the haystack, jumps up all of a sudden, raises his thumb, and says loudly, "I am utterly convinced by you." The girls' hearts are blooming, and the audience also feels happy.
    The play could have ended here, but "Night Battle on Lotus River" still has a final touch; the east is turning white, the sun is slowly rising, and the distant view of the steel plant appears on the horizon. The people on the boat are only talking and forget to row, and the boat is slowly retreating. Bao Die hurriedly reminds everyone to redouble their efforts to win the final victory. The girls immediately become alert and raise the red flag and beat the war drums with unparalleled heroism. Bao Die steadily holds the rudder, and together they face the rising sun and sail forward. At this time, the chorus sings the Hunan boatman's chant in the strongest voice:
    "Oh ho! Oh ho!
    Steel-muscled and iron-boned heroes,
    Girls, why fear the Ghost Gate Pass?
    Unity is strength,
    The sun shines red on half the sky."

    湖南皮影“夜战莲花江”观后
    任德耀
    解放以来的皮影艺术得到党的大力扶持，使它枯木逢春，欣欣向荣。特别是大跃进以来，皮影艺术为总路线、为社会主义建设服务的方向更加明确了。在工农业大跃进形势的鼓舞下，皮影艺术也在大跃进。这里，我要向观众推荐湖南同志们演出的“夜战莲花江”。
    幕启前，剧场里响起了一片雄壮的歌声：
    驾起木船水上游，
    你追我赶抢鳌头，
    一心只为炼钢铁，
    好像端阳赛龙舟。
    歌声激动了全场观众的心。接着幕拉开了，装满生铁的船群，在波浪滚滚的莲花江上连绵不断地前进。这幅画面是远景，观众看不到人，可是船群和歌声立刻把观众带到1958年大炼钢铁热火朝天的情景中。“夜战莲花江”反映的是我们这个伟大时代中的英雄人物：一群年青的姑娘为了不使铁厂因为燃料供应不上而停炉，向年长的木船组长保爹借船运炭。保爹答应借船给她们，但是不相信她们能够划过莲花江上的三个险滩，要叫年青的小伙子来划船。可是，姑娘们干劲很大，她们说服了保爹，和他一起夜战莲花江，终于克服了重重困难按时把炭运到铁厂。
    剧的情节比较简单；但是，演员们饱满的政治热情和熟练的技巧并没有因为情节简单而有所逊色。相反地，充分运用了皮影艺术的特点把主题思想和人物性格更加突出了。
    前面所谈的第一个画面，充分发挥了皮影艺术的特点。中国画风格的布景前面，无数条小船在移动；由于透视的关系，船有大有小，因而画面并不显得呆板。特别是船只移动的节奏层次分明，近的快，较远的慢一些，最远的简直看不出它在移动，这样便把画面处理得十分活泼。配上富有湖南地方特色的音乐和唱腔，雄壮有力，激动人心。人们已经忘记了这是在看皮影，小小的影窗锁不住人们的想像，你可以把画面伸引开去，好像看到了无限广阔的空间，想到我们伟大祖国伟大人民的英雄气概。
    接着，当保爹忙了一天一夜，正靠在草堆上睡一会儿的时候，姑娘们来找他，见他睡了便想和他开玩笑，于是用稻草通他的鼻孔，把他闹醒了。保爹一下子跳起身来，气得不得了，一脚便把一个很大的草堆也给踢走了。这个行动，引起了姑娘们哈哈大笑，也把观众逗乐了，就在这哈哈大笑声中，保爹和姑娘们的性格以及他们之间的关系，都生动地表现出来了。夸张合乎情理的动作，弥补影人面部不能表情的缺陷，这是皮影戏的重要表现手法。
    再看船过鬼门关的时候吧：江面波浪汹涌，船在水上颠簸摇摆；可是船上的人，一点也不惊慌，任你风浪再大，她们仍然以整齐划一的动作，把船只摇向前方。这时影窗上划船的整齐有力的动作，配上坚定的歌声和颠簸的船只、滚滚的波浪，形成了强烈的对比。我们深深地感到人们坚定不移的意志是可以挡得住任何风浪的。
    险滩过去了，船只运行在平静的湖面上，姑娘们轻轻地摇着桨，兴奋地遥望着远方，目的地快到了。他们掩不住心头的喜悦。保爹躺在船尾把舵，仰首望青天，他也在遐想。他们在想什么呢？这时船上展开了一场短短的但是十分有趣的对话。姑娘问保爹服不服？“女孩子能不能赛过男子汉？”保爹又好像刚才在草堆边睡觉被惊醒的情况一样，他一下子就跳起来，翘起大拇指，高声地说道：“服死了你们。”姑娘们的心花都开了，观众也随之而感到愉快。
    戏到这里也可以完了，但是，
  “夜战莲花江”还留着最后的一手；东方发白了，太阳慢慢升起，铁厂的远景在天边出现，船上的人只顾说话忘记划船，船在慢慢地后退了。保爹赶忙提醒大家要加倍努力夺取最后的胜利，姑娘们立刻警觉起来，以无比的英雄气概升起红旗，擂起战鼓。保爹稳稳地把着舵，同心合力迎着朝阳，驶向前方。这时合唱队又以最强音唱出湖南的船伕号子：
    “哦嗬！哦嗬！
    钢筋铁骨英雄汉，
    姑娘何惧鬼门关？
    团结一心力量大，
    太阳红透半边天。”
