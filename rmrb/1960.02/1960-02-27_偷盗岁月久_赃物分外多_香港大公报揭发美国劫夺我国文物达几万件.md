Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, February 26th: The precious cultural relics that were looted from our country by US imperialism over the years before liberation already number in the tens of thousands. Among the stolen goods now hidden in major museums in the United States, there are approximately two thousand Shang and Zhou bronzes, and several hundred famous paintings of significant value in the history of Chinese painting. This was recently revealed by Hong Kong's "Ta Kung Pao."

Hong Kong's "Ta Kung Pao" said that before liberation, the despicable means used by American invaders to plunder Chinese cultural relics were all-encompassing. For example, the Harvard University's Fogg Art Museum, located in Boston, houses a large number of precious cultural relics stolen from our country. It is, in fact, a training base specializing in cultivating "talent" for stealing cultural relics from our country and other countries. Warner, who once served as the director of the Eastern Department of this museum, was a theft expert. In 1924, he went to Dunhuang and used cloth and glue to peel off more than twenty Dunhuang murals, and also "moved" away a Tang Dynasty Guanyin statue.

The newspaper said that more than twenty years ago, in order to facilitate the theft of Chinese cultural relics, the United States simply established the "Harvard-Yenching Institute" within Yenching University, specifically responsible for stealing and transporting Chinese cultural relics to the United States for the United States. In more than a decade, the number of Chinese cultural relics stolen and transported to the United States by this American "institute" is countless. The rare books alone include the Song edition of "Memorials of Various Officials of the Dynasty," the Ming edition of "General History of the Eight Min," "Study of Eastern Barbarians," and many volumes of the "Yongle Encyclopedia." Even a few days before the liberation of Beijing, this so-called "institute" used American planes to loot and transport a batch of Chinese rare books.

American robbers even moved entire ancient Chinese palaces, temples, tombs, statues, and huge murals to the United States. For example, two of the famous Six Steeds of Zhaoling of Emperor Taizong of Tang became the stolen goods of the University of Pennsylvania Museum. In the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri, there is a "Chinese Temple Room," which was created by American robbers who dismantled the Wanfo Pavilion caisson of the Zhihua Temple of the Ming Dynasty in Lumi Cang, Beijing, and the glass palace gate of an imperial tomb in Yixian County, Hebei Province. On the walls of this "Chinese Temple Room" are also embedded Yuan Dynasty murals stolen from Shanxi. A temple in our country and a Ming Dynasty mansion in Beijing were also "moved" to the Philadelphia Museum of Art by American robbers. On the wall at the entrance of the Eastern Department of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York is embedded the famous Northern Wei Buddhist relief "Emperor and Empress Worshipping Buddha" from the Binyang Cave in Longmen, Henan. When American cultural aggression "expert" Alan Priest (the current director of the Eastern Department of the Metropolitan Museum of Art) stole this relief more than twenty years ago, he chiseled the entire huge stone carving into small pieces, thus severely damaging this 1,300-year-old work of art.

"Ta Kung Pao" said that the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. is a "stolen goods museum" specializing in stealing cultural relics from Eastern countries, especially China. The museum's "Chinese Art Exhibition Room" has a total of eight rooms, accounting for half of the museum's area. Among the stolen goods collected in the painting gallery are eighteen hand scrolls and eight vertical axes, including the Tang Dynasty painting of the Sakyamuni Buddha Assembly Scroll, the Song Dynasty copy of Gu Kaizhi's Nymph of the Luo River Scroll, the Song Dynasty Guo Xi's Autumn Clearing in Streams and Mountains Scroll, the Song Dynasty Li Song's Painting of Ghosts Scroll, the Song Dynasty Gong Kai's Zhongshan Outing Scroll, the Song Dynasty Wang Yanshou's Plum Blossom Scroll, the Song Dynasty Ma Yuan's Landscape Scroll, the Song Dynasty Zhao Mengjian's Narcissus Scroll, the Yuan Dynasty Wu Zhen's Fisherman Scroll, the Yuan Dynasty Zhao Yong's Copy of Li Boshi's Figures and Horses Scroll, and other world-renowned paintings. This "art gallery" also has a "Chinese Buddhist Art Exhibition Room" and a "Sculpture Room," housing Tang Dynasty handwritten scriptures, Buddhist paintings from the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, and sculptures from the Northern Wei to the Yuan and Ming dynasties stolen from our country. Among them are stone carvings stolen from Yungang, Tianlongshan, and Gongxian County, Henan. The famous Chinese Tang Dynasty guqin called "Withered Wood Dragon Roar" has also fallen into this American national "stolen goods museum."

The newspaper said that the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston is the earliest and largest museum to house cultural relics taken from our country. Since 1904, the museum has employed Japanese who are familiar with Chinese cultural relics as the director of the Eastern Department, in order to facilitate the looting of our country's cultural relics. The museum's "Chinese Art Room" has as many as ten rooms. The cultural relics inside are all carvings, paintings, ceramics, bronzes, etc. looted from our country, including stone lions stolen from the Wanfo Cave in Longmen, Henan Province, flying apsaras stolen from Xiangtangshan in Hebei Province and Tianlongshan in Shanxi Province, the epitaph and stone cover of Feng Yong's wife from the Northern Wei Dynasty, Shang and Zhou tripods and sacrificial vessels, Qin and Han bronze mirrors, Tang and Song ceramics, and famous paintings such as the "Portraits of Emperors of the Past Dynasties Scroll" painted by Yan Liben of the Tang Dynasty and Song Huizong's copy of Zhang Xuan's "Pounding Silk Scroll."

Hong Kong's "Ta Kung Pao" pointed out that US imperialism is now coveting the precious cultural relics of our country in Taiwan and has illegally signed a so-called "contract" with the Chiang Kai-shek clique in an attempt to steal and transport a large number of our country's cultural relics in Taiwan to the United States. The Chinese people must not remain silent about this kind of robbery. Patriotic people in Taiwan should use all possible means to prevent Americans from stealing our national treasures and transporting them abroad.

    偷盗岁月久　赃物分外多
    香港大公报揭发美国劫夺我国文物达几万件
    新华社香港26日电　我国在解放以前历年来被美帝国主义劫去的珍贵文物已经有几万件。现在在美国各大博物馆窝藏的赃物中，商、周铜器约有二千件；在我国绘画史上具有重要价值的名画有几百帧。这是香港“大公报”最近揭露的。
    香港“大公报”说，解放以前，美国侵略者劫掠我国文物的卑鄙手段，是无所不用其极的。如设立在波士顿的哈佛大学福格艺术博物馆，收藏了大量从我国盗劫回去的珍贵文物。它实际上是一个专门训练对我国和其他国家的文物进行盗窃的“人材”的大本营。曾任这个馆东方部主任的华尔纳就是一个盗窃专家，他曾在1924年到敦煌用布和胶水粘剥，偷去了二十多方敦煌壁画，又“搬”走了唐代观音塑像一座。
    这家报纸说，二十多年前，美国为了便于盗劫我国文物，索性在燕京大学内设立“哈佛燕京学社”，专门负责替美国盗劫偷运我国文物。十多年间，被这个美国的“学社”盗劫偷运美国的我国文物数不胜数。光是善本书就有宋版“国朝诸臣奏议”、明版“八闽通志”、“东夷考略”和许多册“永乐大典”。直到北京解放前几天，这个所谓“学社”还用美国飞机劫运了一批我国的善本书。
    美国强盗甚至把一些我国古代的宫殿、庙宇、陵墓、塑像和巨幅壁画整座搬往美国。如著名的唐太宗昭陵六骏之二成了费城大学博物馆的赃物。在美国堪萨斯州的纳尔逊博物馆中，有一幢“中国庙宇室”，是美国强盗把北京禄米仓明朝的智化寺的万佛阁藻井和河北易县一座皇陵的玻璃宫门等建筑物拆去并成的。这个“中国庙宇室”的墙上还嵌着从山西偷去的元代大壁画。我国的一座庙宇和北京明代的一幢王府，也被美国强盗“搬”到费城艺术博物馆中。在纽约都城博物馆东方部入口处的墙上，嵌着河南龙门宾阳洞著名的北魏佛教浮雕“帝后礼佛图”。美国文化侵略“专家”普爱伦（现任纽约都城博物馆东方部主任）在二十多年前偷盗这座浮雕时，把整块巨大的石刻凿成小块，因而把这个一千三百年前的艺术品弄得遍体鳞伤，严重损坏。
    “大公报”说，美国国立华盛顿弗利尔艺术馆是专门盗劫东方国家尤其是中国的文物的一家“赃物馆”。这个馆的“中国文物陈列室”共有八大间，占了全馆面积的一半。在绘画馆收藏的赃物中，包括十八个手卷和八幅立轴，其中有唐人画的释迦牟尼佛会图卷，宋人摹顾恺之洛神图卷，宋人郭熙溪山秋霁卷，宋人李嵩画鬼卷，宋人龚开中山出游图卷，宋人王岩叟梅花卷，宋人马远山水长卷，宋人赵孟坚水仙图卷，元人吴镇渔父图卷、元人赵雍临李伯时人马图卷等等世界稀有的名画。这个“艺术馆”还设有“中国佛教艺术陈列室”和“雕刻室”，窝藏着从我国盗劫去的唐人写经、宋元明各朝的佛画、北魏到元明的雕塑。其中有从云冈、天龙山和河南巩县偷凿的石刻。我国唐朝一具名叫“枯木龙哈”的名琴，也落在这个美国国立的“赃物馆”中。
    报纸说，美国波士顿美术博物馆是窝藏从我国夺去的文物最早和最多的一家博物馆。从1904年起，这家博物馆就用熟悉中国文物的日本人担任东方部主任，以便于掠夺我国文物。这家博物馆的“中国文物专室”竟有十大间。其中的文物都是劫自我国的雕刻、绘画、陶瓷、铜器等，包括从河南省龙门万佛洞偷凿下来的石狮，从河北省响堂山、山西省天龙山偷凿下来的飞天，北魏冯邕妻的墓志和石盖，商周鼎彝，秦汉铜镜，唐宋陶瓷和唐朝阎立本绘的“历代帝王图像卷”，宋徽宗摹张萱“捣练图卷”等名画。
    香港“大公报”指出，美帝国主义现在又垂涎我国在台湾的珍贵文物，与蒋介石集团非法签订所谓“合同”，企图把大批我国在台文物盗运往美国。对这种强盗行为，中国人民绝不能缄默。在台湾的爱国人士，应该用一切可能的方法，阻止美国人盗运我国国宝出境。
