    (Our newspaper Changchun, February 25th) The three northeastern provinces, with fewer laborers, more land, and a longer ice and snow season, have fully utilized the superiority of the People's Communes and achieved unprecedentedly brilliant achievements in water conservancy construction this past winter and spring.
    The common characteristics of water conservancy construction in the three provinces are: leaders are determined, the masses are enthusiastic, action is taken early, and progress is fast. Party committees at all levels have ensured that secretaries take the lead and deeply mobilize the masses. After the autumn harvest, they have planned to transfer labor forces to the mountains and water management front in batches, forming a high tide of water conservancy construction half a month to a month earlier than in previous years. The total labor force participating in water conservancy construction in the three provinces reached more than 3 million, accounting for more than 30% of the rural labor force. By the end of January, Liaoning Province had completed newly built and improved projects equivalent to twice the total amount of projects completed throughout last year, expanding the irrigated area by more than 2.3 million mu, controlling 1.5 million mu of waterlogged land, and increasing the area controlling soil erosion by 5.1 million mu. As of early February, the large, medium, and small-scale water conservancy projects completed in Jilin Province were approximately equal to the amount of projects completed throughout last year, increasing the irrigated area by 3.7 million mu, controlling 2.94 million mu of waterlogged land, and initially controlling soil erosion in an area of more than 1,300 square li. Heilongjiang Province has now completed more than 116 million cubic meters of earthwork, increasing paddy fields by more than 670,000 mu, irrigated land by more than 1.53 million mu, controlling 250,000 mu of waterlogged land, and initially controlling soil erosion in an area of more than 100 square kilometers.
    Another characteristic of water conservancy construction in the three provinces is that the plans are specific, the goals are clear, and the priorities are prominent. Under the guidance of the "three main" principles, all localities have generally implemented the principle of "overall planning, comprehensive management, adapting to local conditions, diversification, relying on the masses, and running water conservancy diligently and thriftily," combining large, medium, and small projects and realizing the systematization of water conservancy projects, greatly improving the level of water conservancy construction. Jilin Province has completed and is currently constructing a total of more than 3,300 various small-scale projects and more than 70 large, medium, and small-scale backbone projects, gradually forming a complete water conservancy project system.
    In terms of "relying on the masses and running water conservancy diligently and thriftily," each province has established its own advanced examples. The Jiangmifeng People's Commune in Yongji County, Jilin Province, relied on its own efforts to build three reservoirs, which were praised by the water conservancy department. After Liaoning Province promoted the "five self-sufficiencies and one mechanization" (the five self-sufficiencies are: raising funds by oneself, manufacturing tools by oneself, making explosives by oneself, burning cement by oneself, and learning technology by oneself; the one mechanization is the implementation of soil mechanization in construction) advanced water management experience created by the Hongqi People's Commune in Fuxin County's Cangtu Reservoir, the atmosphere of running water conservancy diligently and thriftily has become prevalent throughout the province, greatly accelerating the progress of water conservancy construction.
    In water conservancy construction, all localities have embodied the spirit of combining long-term construction with current benefits. While focusing on new construction projects, they actively improve existing engineering facilities, coordinate projects, and promptly realize benefits, using them while building them, and using them wherever they are built. In Liaoning Province, among the completed projects, coordinated and improved projects account for more than two-fifths, and the province's winter irrigation area has reached approximately 1 million mu. Since last winter, more than half of Jilin Province's water conservancy army has been engaged in project coordination, and the coordinated projects account for more than 60% of the province's total projects, basically achieving reservoirs with canals and canals connected to form a network.
    The third characteristic of water conservancy construction in the three provinces is high efficiency and good quality. At the beginning of the water conservancy construction movement last winter, the leading departments in various localities deeply mobilized the masses. They vigorously promoted tool reform and launched a vigorous high-efficiency movement. The water conservancy construction tools and new methods created by the masses have emerged in large numbers like bamboo shoots after a spring rain since last winter. As of early February, five counties and six hundred water conservancy construction sites in Liaoning Province had basically realized vehicle transportation and soil mechanization. The average work efficiency of the province has increased by more than double compared with the same period of the previous year. As of the end of January, the average work efficiency in Jilin Province has increased from 0.8 cubic meters at the beginning of the movement to 2.4 cubic meters. The vast majority of medium-sized and larger construction sites in the province have basically implemented vehicle transportation, ice road sledding, earth excavation blasting, and semi-mechanized rolling. More than 300 construction sites in Heilongjiang Province have realized soil mechanization and semi-mechanization. The average maximum work efficiency of the province has reached 2.7 cubic meters.
    At present, the broad masses of people in the three provinces are vigorously grasping project coordination and preparing for the interception of peach blossom floods, striving to basically complete the year's water conservancy construction tasks before spring plowing. (Attached picture)

    东北三省广大人民继续狠抓水利建设
    力争春耕前完成全年任务
    本报长春25日电　劳力少、土地多、冰雪季节较长的东北三省，充分运用人民公社的优越性，在去冬今春水利建设中，取得了史无前例的辉煌成就。
    三省水利建设共同的特点是：领导决心大，群众干劲足，动手早，进度快。各级党委都做到了书记挂帅，深入发动群众，在秋耕结束以后，就有计划的把劳动力分批转入治山、治水战线，比往年提前半个月到一个月形成了水利建设高潮。三省参加水利建设的总劳力达三百多万，占农村劳力的30％以上。辽宁省1月底已完成新修和改善的工程，相当于去年全年工程总量的二倍，共扩大灌溉面积二百三十多万亩，治理涝洼地一百五十万亩，增加控制水土流失面积五百一十万亩。吉林省截至2月上旬，已完成的大中小型水利工程，约等于去年全年完成的工程量，共增加灌溉面积三百七十万亩，治理涝洼地面积二百九十四万亩，初步控制水土流失面积一千三百多平方里。黑龙江省目前已完成土方量一亿一千六百多万立方米，增加水田六十七万多亩，水浇地一百五十三万多亩、治理涝洼地二十五万多亩，初步控制水土流失面积一百多平方公里。
    三省水利建设另一个特点是规划具体，目标明确，重点突出。各地在“三主”方针的指导下，普遍贯彻了“全面规划，综合治理，因地制宜，多种多样，依靠群众，勤俭办水利”的原则，做到了大中小工程相结合，实现了水利工程系统化，大大提高了水利建设水平。吉林省已经完成和正在施工的各种小型工程共有三千三百多处，大中小型骨干工程七十多处，已逐步形成了完整的水利工程系统。
    在“依靠群众，勤俭办水利”方面，各省都树立了自己的先进典范。吉林省永吉县江密峰人民公社自力更生，修成了三座水库，受到了水利部门的称赞。辽宁省推广了阜新县红旗人民公社苍土水库创造的“五自一化”（五自是：资金自己筹，工具自己造，炸药自己熬，水泥自己烧，技术自己学；一化是施工实行土机械化）的先进治水经验后，勤俭办水利的风气在全省普遍形成，大大加快了水利建设进度。
    各地在水利建设中，都体现了长远建设和当年受益相结合的精神。在抓新建工程的同时，积极改善现有工程设施，使工程配套，及时发挥效益，作到边修边用，修好一处用一处。辽宁省已经完工的工程中，配套和改善提高工程即占五分之二以上，全省冬灌面积已达到一百万亩左右。吉林省从去冬以来，有一半以上的水利大军从事工程配套，已完成配套的工程占全省总工程的60％以上，基本上做到了有库就有渠、渠道连成网。
    三省水利建设第三个特点是，工效高，质量好。去冬水利建设运动一开始，各地领导部门就深入发动群众。狠抓工具改革，开展了轰轰烈烈的高工效运动。群众创造的水利施工工具和新方法，自去冬以来就像雨后春笋大量涌现。辽宁省到2月初止，已有五个县和六百个水利工地基本上实现了车子化和土机械化。全省平均工效比前一年同期提高一倍以上。吉林省到1月末止，全省平均工效由运动初期的零点八立方米提高到二点四立方米。全省中型以上的工地绝大部分基本实行了运输车子化，冰道爬犁化，挖土爆破化，碾压半机械化。黑龙江省有三百多处工地实现了土机械化和半机械化。全省平均最高工效达到二点七立方米。
    目前，三省的广大人民，正大抓工程配套，进行拦截桃花水的准备工作，力争在春耕前基本上完成全年的水利建设任务。（附图片）
