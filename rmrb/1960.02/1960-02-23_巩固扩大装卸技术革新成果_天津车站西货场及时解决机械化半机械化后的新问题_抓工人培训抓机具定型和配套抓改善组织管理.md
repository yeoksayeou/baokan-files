Consolidate and Expand the Achievements of Loading and Unloading Technological Innovation
Tianjin Station West Freight Yard Promptly Solves New Problems After Mechanization and Semi-Mechanization
Grasp Worker Training, Grasp Machine Tool Finalization and Matching, Grasp Improvement of Organization and Management

This newspaper Tianjin, 22nd dispatch: After the Tianjin Station West Freight Yard workers achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization of handling, loading, and unloading operations at high speed, they promptly finalized and matched new machine tools, actively learned new machine tool driving skills, improved labor organization, and strengthened freight yard management. These actions consolidated and improved technological innovation achievements, increased transportation efficiency, accelerated the freight location turnover rate by three hours, and shortened vehicle dwell time from seven hours to five point nine hours.

In the technological innovation and technical revolution movement, the Tianjin Station West Freight Yard quickly armed the freight yard's loading and unloading operations with machine tools, increasing the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization from 10% to over 95%, fundamentally changing the mode of operation. Under this new situation, helping the loading and unloading workers quickly master the technology of driving new machine tools and fully utilizing the role of new machine tools became an urgent problem to solve. The freight yard promptly organized amateur technical training classes for loading and unloading workers, with the director of the freight yard's technical innovation factory and veteran technical workers explaining the performance and use of various new machine tools. At the same time, technical demonstration competitions were organized to enable employees to quickly improve their technical level through on-site observation. Many loading and unloading workers studied diligently, actively consulted with people with technical skills, and four hundred loading and unloading workers in the entire freight yard have learned mechanical operation.

In the process of using the new machine tools, workers found that some of the new machine tools were not perfect enough, so they adopted a "three-way combination" method to select, finalize, and match the new machine tools. After improvement and matching, many machine tools greatly improved in quality, changed from bulky to flexible, from single-use to multi-use, from low efficiency to high efficiency, and from incomplete to complete sets. For example, in the past, when unloading coal with a fixed winch, work could only be carried out from one car door, and it took three moves to unload a car of coal, which was quite laborious. After research by loading and unloading worker Wang Lianhai and technicians, a live turntable was installed, allowing the winch to freely change direction. In this way, coal can be continuously unloaded from three car doors in a fixed place, greatly improving efficiency.

After the freight yard's loading and unloading operations were fully mechanized and semi-mechanized, the problem arose that the organization and management of production did not match the new mode of operation. In the past, the freight yard's lines and freight locations were not fixed, and large pieces of goods and bulk materials were often unloaded together, and various loading and unloading machine tools were mixed together for operations, which could not fully exert their power. Because the unloading location was not fixed, workers had to carry the machines back and forth, which hindered the improvement of loading and unloading efficiency. Now, the freight yard has formulated a freight yard and tool management plan based on the type of goods, lines, machine tools, and on-site environment, and implemented fixed-line unloading. At the same time, personnel and machine tools are fixed according to the type of goods, and the same type of goods are concentrated on fixed lines for loading and unloading. The machine tools do not need to be moved back and forth, and their functions are fully utilized, and on-site operations are also carried out in an orderly manner. This has accelerated the turnover speed, shortened the vehicle dwell time, and exploited the transportation potential.

In order to adapt to the new situation of using new machine tools and the improved technical level of the handling workers, this freight yard has also improved the labor organization. The original eight workers per group have now been changed to six workers. In this way, the entire freight yard saved more than 40 workers, added an extra shift, opened an extra loading and unloading port, shortened the loading and unloading time, accelerated vehicle turnover, and achieved increased production without increasing manpower.

Cars or horse-drawn carts load goods from under the warehouse, and the car can be filled in less than a minute by opening the warehouse door. Xinhua News Agency reporter Liang Yiding

    巩固扩大装卸技术革新成果
    天津车站西货场及时解决机械化半机械化后的新问题
    抓工人培训抓机具定型和配套抓改善组织管理
    本报天津22日电　天津车站西货场职工在高速度实现搬运装卸机械化和半机械化以后，及时对新机具进行定型、配套，积极学习新机具驾驶技术，改善劳动组织，加强货场管理，巩固和提高技术革新成果，提高运输效率，使货位周转率加快了三个小时，车辆停留时间由过去的七小时缩短到五点九小时。
    天津车站西货场在技术革新和技术革命运动中，很快就把货场的装卸作业用机具武装起来，机械化和半机械化的程度，由过去的10％提高到95％以上，操作方式发生了根本性的变化。在这种新形势下，帮助装卸工人迅速掌握驾驶新机具的技术，充分发挥新机具的作用，成了急需解决的问题。货场及时组织了装卸工人业余技术训练班，由货场技术革新工厂的厂长、老技术工人讲解各种新机具的性能和使用方法。同时，组织了技术表演赛，使职工通过现场观摩，迅速提高技术水平。不少装卸工人苦钻苦学，积极向有技术的人请教，全货场已有四百名装卸工人学会了机械操作。
    工人们在使用新机具的过程中，发现有些新机具还不够完善，便采取“三结合”的方式，对新机具进行了选型、定型和配套工作。不少机具经过改进和配套以后，大大提高了质量，由笨重变为灵巧，由单项使用变为多项使用，由效率低变为效率高，由不成套变为成套。例如，过去用固定式的卷扬机卸煤，只能从一个车门进行作业，卸一车煤要移动三次，相当费力。经过装卸工人王连海和技术人员研究，安装上活转盘，使卷扬机能自由转变方向。这样，在一个固定的地方，就能连续地从三个车门把煤卸下，效率大大提高。
    货场装卸作业全部机械化、半机械化以后，出现了生产的组织管理同新的操作方式不相适应的问题。过去货场线路、货位都不固定，大件货和散装物资经常卸在一起，各种装卸机具也混在一起进行作业，不能充分施展威力；由于卸货地点不固定，工人就得抬着机器来回跑，这便妨害了装卸效率的提高，现在，这个货场根据货类品种、线路、机具和现场环境，制定了货场和工具管理方案，实行了定线卸货；同时，按照货物品种固定人员、机具，把同品种货物集中在固定线路上装卸，机具不用来回搬动，充分发挥了作用，现场作业也作到了有条不紊。这就加快了周转速度，缩短了车辆停留时间，发挥了运输潜力。
    为适应使用新机具和搬运工人技术水平提高的新情况，这个货场还改善了劳动组织。原来每组八个工人，现在改为六个工人。这样，全货场共节约四十多名工人，多编了一个班，多开了一个装卸口，缩短了装卸时间，加速了车辆周转，实现了增产不增人。（附图片）
