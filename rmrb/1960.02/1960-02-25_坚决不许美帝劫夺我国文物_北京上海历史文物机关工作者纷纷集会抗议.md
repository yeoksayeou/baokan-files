Xinhua News Agency, February 24th—The news that US imperialism is preparing to plunder our precious cultural relics in Taiwan has aroused great indignation among the staff of various historical and cultural relics institutions in the capital and Shanghai.

In recent days, staff from many historical and cultural relics institutions in the capital have held gatherings one after another, warmly supporting the Ministry of Culture's statement and condemning US imperialism's new crime of attempting to plunder our cultural relics in Taiwan on a large scale. Many staff members of historical and cultural relics institutions have posted big-character posters and jointly published protest letters. On the 23rd, all staff members of the Palace Museum held a protest rally. Wu Zhongchao, the director of the museum, solemnly declared at the meeting: On behalf of the Palace Museum, he strongly protested against US imperialism's conspiracy to illegally steal the museum's cultural relics in Taiwan to the United States; and stated that the 2,972 boxes of Palace Museum cultural relics that were stolen and transported to Taiwan by the Chiang Kai-shek group before liberation are the valuable property of all Chinese people. The Chiang Kai-shek group has absolutely no right to dispose of them, and any "contract" it signs with the United States is invalid. The Chiang Kai-shek group must properly protect these cultural relics and prepare to return them to the motherland in the future.

At the protest rally, filled with passionate indignation, all staff members of the Palace Museum unanimously adopted a letter of protest against US imperialism. The protest letter stated: "Taiwan is our territory, and we must liberate Taiwan. The cultural relics in Taiwan are our country's precious property, and we must recover them. Our Palace Museum and brother units have the sacred duty to protect this batch of cultural relics. Every item of cultural relics in Taiwan has an account, and if it is stolen, we will resolutely pursue the thieves and recover the stolen goods. No matter where it is stolen to, even to the ends of the earth, we will never give up until it is recovered. US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek group must bear full responsibility for any damage or shortage."

Yin Da, Hou Wailu, Yang Xiangkui, Xiong Deji, Gu Jiegang, He Changqun, Weng Dujian and other 167 people from the Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences jointly published a letter of protest, pointing out: "US imperialism is our most ferocious enemy. It has always insisted on being hostile to the 650 million Chinese people, occupying our territory of Taiwan, conspiring to create 'two Chinas,' and constantly carrying out military provocations in the Taiwan Strait area. US imperialism's banditry of stealing our cultural relics in Taiwan is part of its policy of hostility towards the Chinese people. However, we want to warn the US imperialists that the era in which the Chinese people could be bullied by others is long gone."

Xia Nai, Niu Zhaoxun, Guo Baojun, Huang Wenbi and other 24 people from the Institute of Archeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, pointed out in their protest letter: "Some of us participated in the excavation of this batch of antiquities, and we are even more indignant to hear the news that they are being plundered. US imperialists are habitual thieves who are addicted to aggression. The "Paying Homage to Buddha" mural of Longmen Grottoes in Luoyang and two of the "Six Steeds of Zhaoling" in Xi'an have already been looted by them. More than a hundred boxes of rare books deposited in American libraries and more than ten thousand pieces of Juyan Han bamboo slips are still long overdue. This habitual thief is now thinking of "exhausting our essence, opening cabinets and lifting boxes, carrying bags and rushing away." How can we allow them to be so rampant! We warn US imperialism: the cultural heritage of the Chinese nation is the wealth of all our people, and no one is allowed to plunder it. Even if it is transported to the ends of the earth, we will definitely recover it in full."

All the staff of the Anyang Archaeological Team of the Institute of Archeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences also issued a letter of protest, strongly protesting against the bandit behavior of US imperialism in preparing to steal the cultural relics unearthed from the Yin Ruins in Anyang and other Chinese cultural relics in Taiwan to the United States.

The State Archives Bureau, Beijing Library, Chinese Painting Academy, Chinese Art Institute, Department of History and Archeology of Peking University and other units also held gatherings one after another and published letters of protest, severely condemning US imperialism's new crime of preparing to plunder our cultural relics in Taiwan on a large scale.

Famous figures in Shanghai's cultural and historical circles, including Jin Zhonghua, Xu Senyu, Chen Wangdao, Zhou Gucheng, Zhou Yutong, Yang Kuan, Guo Shaoyu, Feng Zikai, and Li Qingya, also jointly published a letter of protest, demanding that patriotic compatriots in Taiwan should unite with the people of the whole country, rise up in time to protect the cultural relics of the motherland, and stop this act of plunder. This is the sacred right and due obligation of the Chinese people.

    坚决不许美帝劫夺我国文物
    北京上海历史文物机关工作者纷纷集会抗议
    据新华社24日讯　美帝国主义准备劫夺我国在台湾的珍贵文物的消息传出后，激起了首都和上海各个历史文物机关的工作人员极大的愤慨。
    首都许多历史文物机关工作人员连日纷纷举行集会，热烈拥护文化部的声明，谴责美帝国主义企图大批劫夺我国在台文物的新罪行。许多历史文物机关工作人员纷纷张贴大字报和联名发表了抗议书。23日，故宫博物院全体工作人员举行了抗议大会。院长吴仲超在大会上严正宣告：他代表故宫博物院对美帝国主义阴谋把该院在台湾的文物非法盗劫往美国，提出强烈的抗议；并且声明，在解放前被蒋介石集团盗运往台湾的二千九百七十二箱故宫博物院文物，是全中国人民的宝贵财产，蒋介石集团绝对无权加以处理，它与美国签订的任何“合同”均属无效。蒋介石集团对这些文物必须妥善保护，准备将来归还祖国。
    故宫博物院全体工作人员在群情激昂的抗议大会上，一致通过了对美帝国主义的抗议书。抗议书上说：“台湾是我们的国土，我们一定要解放台湾。在台湾的文物是我国的珍贵财产，我们一定要收回。我们故宫博物院和各兄弟单位有保管这批文物的神圣职责。在台湾的文物，每一件都有账目，如果被盗劫，我们坚决要追贼追赃。无论被劫到天涯海角，不追回来，决不罢休。只要有丝毫损伤和短少，美帝国主义和蒋介石集团必须负全部责任。”
    中国科学院历史研究所尹达、侯外庐、杨向奎、熊德基、顾颉刚、贺昌群、翁独健等一百六十七人联名发表的抗议书指出：“美帝国主义是我们最凶恶的敌人。它一直坚持与六亿五千万中国人民为敌，霸占我国领土台湾，阴谋制造‘两个中国’，不断在台湾海峡地区进行军事挑衅活动。美帝国主义盗劫我国在台文物的强盗行径，是它敌视中国人民的政策的一部分。但是，我们要警告美帝国主义者，中国人民任人欺侮的时代早已一去不复返了。”
    中国科学院考古研究所夏鼐、牛兆勋、郭宝钧、黄文弼等二十四人发表的抗议书上指出：“我们中有些参加过这批古物发掘的人，听到它们被人劫掠的消息，更是愤慨万分。美帝国主义者是侵略成性的惯盗。我们洛阳龙门的礼佛图，西安昭陵的六骏之二，早已被它掠夺了去。寄存美国图书馆的善本书百余箱，居延汉简万余片，至今仍久假不归。这个惯盗，今又思‘竭我精华，负匮揭箧，担囊而趋’，我们怎能任其如此猖狂！我们警告美帝国主义：中华民族的文化遗产，是我全国人民的财富，决不允许任何人掠夺，即令运至天涯地角，我们誓必全数追回。”
    中国科学院考古研究所安阳考古队全体人员也发表了抗议书，强烈抗议美帝国主义准备把安阳殷墟出土的文物和我国其他在台文物劫往美国的强盗行为。
    国家档案局、北京图书馆、中国画院、中国美术研究所、北京大学历史系和考古专业等单位也都纷纷举行集会，发表了抗议书，严厉斥责美帝国主义准备大批盗劫我国在台文物的新罪行。
    上海文化、历史学界著名人士金仲华、徐森玉、陈望道、周谷城、周予同、杨宽、郭绍虞、丰子恺、李青崖等四十六人也联名发表了抗议书，抗议书要求台湾的爱国同胞，应该和全国人民一道，及时起来保护祖国文物，制止这种劫夺行为。这是我国人民的神圣权利和应有的义务。
