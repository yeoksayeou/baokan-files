    Several Questions Regarding River Network Development

    Question: Digging river channels requires a lot of land. Doesn't this reduce the amount of arable land, and is it worth it?

    Answer: According to calculations, even if the area of land occupied by river networks reaches about 15% of the cultivated area (in reality, it won't occupy that much), it is still very worthwhile. Because with river networks, dry land is transformed into irrigated land, ensuring stable yields and increased production, with a significantly higher yield than before. Switching to rice cultivation can increase yields several times over, completely compensating for the yield lost from the reduced land area. For example, in Wangshi Commune, Fuyang County, a new rice-growing area in Huaibei, more than 26,000 mu of spring rice were planted in 1959. Despite a rare drought with over a hundred days of little rain, the average yield was 1,516 jin per mu, with 6,700 mu yielding 2,300 jin per mu. In addition, the income from developing diversified economic activities after the implementation of river network development is even greater. Transportation becomes more convenient, saving labor and increasing revenue.

    Question: After the implementation of river network development, many places will store water year-round. Will this cause soil salinization?

    Answer: According to investigations by the Central Institute of Water Conservancy and Hydroelectric Power in key areas of Shandong, Henan, and other provinces, building river networks and converting to rice cultivation not only desalinizes the topsoil but also freshens the groundwater. Draining water through river networks and lowering the groundwater level can remove salt from the soil. River network development can also maintain the groundwater level at a certain depth, preventing soil salinization in the spring. Therefore, as long as reasonable irrigation is implemented, river network development will not only prevent soil salinization but is also a good way to fundamentally control saline-alkali land.

    Question: If there is little rainfall and the water volume in the river network is insufficient, what should be done?

    Answer: River network development projects are spread across vast plains, covering a large area, and can fully store rainwater, surface runoff, and groundwater from that area. In particular, utilizing groundwater is a crucial key to ensuring that the river network always has a certain amount of stored water.

    有关河网化的几个问题
    问：挖河道要占用不少土地，这样减少了耕地面积，是不是合算？
    答：据计算，河网占用土地面积即使达到耕地面积的百分之十五左右（实际上占不了这么多），也仍然是很合算的。因为有了河网，旱地变成水浇地，能保收增产，比原来产量会大大提高；改种水稻，产量更可以成几倍地增加，完全可以弥补所减少的土地的产量。如淮北新稻区阜阳县王市公社，一九五九年种春稻二万六千多亩，在百日少雨的奇旱情况下，平均亩产一千五百一十六斤，其中有六千七百亩亩产二千三百斤。再加上实现河网化以后，发展多种经济的收入，就更多了。交通更加便利，既能大大节约劳动力，也能增加许多收益。
    问：实现河网化以后，常年有许多地方蓄水，会不会引起土地的盐碱化？
    答：据中央水利电力研究院在山东、河南等省重点地区的调查证明，兴修河网改种水稻，不但有使表土脱盐的作用，还有使地下水淡化的作用。通过河网排水，降低地下水位，可以排除土壤盐分。河网化还可使地下水位维持一定深度，防止春天土壤返盐。因此，只要实行合理灌溉，河网化不但不会使土壤盐碱化，而且是根治盐碱地的好办法。
    问：如果下雨很少，河网里水量不足，怎么办？
    答：河网化工程铺在广大平原上，它联系的面积很大，能充分蓄积广大面积上的雨水、地面径流水和地下水。特别是利用地下水，是保证河网经常有一定蓄水量的重要关键。
