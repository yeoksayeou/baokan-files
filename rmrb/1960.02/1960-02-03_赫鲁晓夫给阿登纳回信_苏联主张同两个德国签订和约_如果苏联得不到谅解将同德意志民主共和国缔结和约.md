Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd, Moscow Dispatch: Moscow newspapers today published a letter from Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, to West German Chancellor Adenauer, in reply to Adenauer's letter of January 8.

Khrushchev wrote, "We believe that the issue of complete disarmament is the primary issue among the primary issues facing all mankind today. The Soviet Union not only considers this issue to be of particular importance, but also takes concrete measures to resolve it."

Khrushchev wrote, "The Soviet Union advocates complete disarmament and comprehensive international supervision so that no country that is not sincere about its obligations can secretly build up armed forces, confront other countries with acts of aggression, and thereby threaten the people of other countries."

Khrushchev said, "The Soviet government believes that while reaching an agreement on complete and thorough disarmament, it is necessary to establish strict international supervision of the disarmament process, rather than isolated 'supervision' divorced from disarmament." In the current situation, isolated "supervision" can only create mutual gathering of intelligence and cannot achieve disarmament.

Turning to the German question, Khrushchev wrote, "In the current situation, the Soviet government's proposal to conclude a peace treaty with Germany is a concrete expression of recognizing the right of the German people to decide their own path of national development. It is precisely on the basis of the principle of self-determination that a peace treaty with Germany must be signed. Since there is no unified German government now, then, in order to eliminate the remnants of the Second World War, a peace treaty should be signed with both Germanies."

Khrushchev pointed out that it would be natural for the government of the Federal Republic of Germany to establish contact with the government of the German Democratic Republic and to try to jointly resolve issues related to the two Germanies through consultation. Reunification is not the task of any third country, but the task of the two Germanies, the task of all the German people.

He emphasized that the boundaries formed by the war and determined in the corresponding Allied agreements cannot be modified when concluding a peace treaty with Germany.

Khrushchev wrote, "I think that the Federal Government opposes a peace treaty largely out of fear of losing the basis for implementing its revanchist policy."

Khrushchev said, "Those who refuse to conclude a peace treaty and propose revising the boundaries expect to have the opportunity to resolve this issue by force." Otherwise, there is no way to explain why the government of the Federal Republic of Germany delays recognizing the current boundaries, delays concluding a peace treaty, and resolutely refuses to establish normal relations with socialist countries.

Khrushchev mentioned Adenauer's recent remarks in Italy, where Adenauer once again spread the notorious slander of the so-called "communist threat." Khrushchev pointed out that the claim that West Germany has a "special mission" in opposing communism cannot but remind people of the darkest aspects of the old Germany not long ago.

Khrushchev pointed out that under the conditions that have formed in West Germany, fascists and Hitlerites have begun to run rampant and are increasingly coming out into the open. They spread hatred and anti-Semitic poison. Such things can only happen under conditions of protecting and condoning fascists.

Khrushchev pointed out that the Soviet Union believes that there is no other way to fundamentally normalize the situation in West Berlin in the current situation other than turning West Berlin into a free city. Khrushchev said that we do not agree to maintain the occupation regime in West Berlin and the existing abnormal state there. He emphasized that leaving the Berlin issue unresolved also means delaying a peace settlement with Germany.

Khrushchev wrote, "If the Soviet Union does not obtain understanding, then it has no other choice but to conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic and take into account all the consequences arising therefrom, including the consequences for West Berlin. This treaty will resolve the border issues between Germany and the People's Republic of Poland and the Czechoslovak Republic."

Khrushchev concluded by saying that with the conclusion of the peace treaty, everyone will understand that attempts to revise the existing borders can only lead to war, and nothing else.

### 赫鲁晓夫给阿登纳回信  苏联主张同两个德国签订和约  如果苏联得不到谅解将同德意志民主共和国缔结和约

    赫鲁晓夫给阿登纳回信
    苏联主张同两个德国签订和约
    如果苏联得不到谅解将同德意志民主共和国缔结和约
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：莫斯科的报纸今天刊登了苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫给西德总理阿登纳的一封信，这封信是对阿登纳1月8日来信的答复。
    赫鲁晓夫写道，我们认为，全面裁军问题是目前摆在全人类面前的首要问题中的首要问题。苏联不仅认为这一问题具有特别重要的意义，而且采取具体措施来解决这个问题。
    赫鲁晓夫写道，苏联主张彻底裁军并进行全面的国际监督，以使任何一个对本国所承担的义务没有诚意的国家都不能暗地里建立武装部队，置他国人民于侵略事实的面前，从而使他国人民遭到威胁。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联政府认为，在就全面彻底裁军问题达成协议的同时，必须对裁军的进行建立严格的国际监督，而不是脱离裁军的孤立的“监督”。而在目前情况下，孤立的“监督”只能造成彼此收集侦察情报，而不可能达到裁军。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到德国问题时写道，在目前情况下，苏联政府关于缔结对德和约的建议，是承认德国人有权自己决定本民族发展道路的具体表示。正是由自决的原则出发，才必须签订对德和约，既然现在没有统一的德国政府，那末，为了清除第二次世界大战的残迹，就应该同两个德国签订和约。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，德意志联邦共和国政府应该同德意志民主共和国政府建立接触，并通过协商设法共同解决有关两个德国的问题，这原是很自然的事。重新统一不是任何第三国的任务，而是两个德国的任务，是全体德国人民的任务。
    他强调指出，由于战争所形成的、并在相应的盟国协议中确定的疆界，不能在缔结对德国和约时加以修改。
    赫鲁晓夫写道：“我想，联邦政府之所以反对和约，在很大程度上是由于害怕丧失执行复仇主义政策的基础。”
    赫鲁晓夫说：“那些拒绝缔结和约并提出修改疆界问题的人指望有机会用武力来解决这个问题。”否则，就无法解释德意志联邦共和国政府为什么拖延承认目前的疆界，拖延缔结和约，坚决不愿意同社会主义国家建立正常的关系。
    赫鲁晓夫谈到阿登纳最近在意大利的谈话，阿登纳在那里又一次散布臭名远扬的所谓“共产主义威胁”的谰言。赫鲁晓夫指出，关于西德在反对共产主义的活动中负有“特别使命”的说法，不能不使人想起不久前的旧德国最阴暗的方面。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在西德所形成的条件下，法西斯分子和希特勒分子开始猖獗起来了，并且越来越多地出头露面了。他们散布仇恨和反犹的毒物。这种事情只有在包庇纵容法西斯分子的条件下才会发生。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联认为，除了把西柏林变成自由城市以外，没有别的办法在当前情况下使西柏林局势根本正常化。赫鲁晓夫说，我们不同意在西柏林保留占领制度和那里现存的不正常状态，他强调指出，把柏林问题留作悬案还意味着拖延对德媾和。
    赫鲁晓夫写道，如果苏联得不到谅解，那么它就没有别的办法，只好同德意志民主共和国缔结和约，并考虑到由此产生的一切后果，其中包括对西柏林产生的后果。这个条约将解决德国同波兰人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国的疆界问题。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，随着和约的缔结，大家都会明白，企图修改现有的疆界，只能把事情引向战争，而不能是别的。
