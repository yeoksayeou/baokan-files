Xinhua News Agency, February 25th: (Our reporter reports) May 22nd marks the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Zenjinza Theatre Company. Tonight, the artists of Zenjinza joyfully celebrated their company's anniversary in advance with prominent figures from China's literary and art circles.

	This was a unique celebration of longevity in the traditional Chinese style. At the center of the stage in the banquet hall of the Xinqiao Hotel hung the emblem of the Zenjinza Theatre Company, surrounded by a profusion of blooming flowers. The walls of the hall were adorned with poems and paintings, a dazzling array of gifts from their Chinese hosts to Zenjinza. As the renowned Japanese Zenjinza artists arrived in Beijing, hundreds of Chinese hosts greeted them with rhythmic and enthusiastic applause to the tune of "People of the World, One Heart."

	Tonight, at the celebration reception held by the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Chinese Dramatists Association, prominent figures from China's literary and art circles, including Guo Moruo, Shen Yanbing, Yang Hansheng, Mei Lanfang, Xu Guangping, Xia Yan, Zhang Zhixiang, Ding Xilin, Tian Han, Ouyang Yuqian, Lao She, Ye Shengtao, Shao Quanlin, Lü Ji, Ma Sicong, Wu Zuoren, Ma Shaobo, Zhang Geng, and others, joined the outstanding Japanese artists in celebrating the Zenjinza Theatre Company's achievements over the past thirty years in promoting Japanese national dramatic traditions and progressive art. They wished them continued dedication to the cause of Japanese independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, and the unwavering maintenance of youthful Japanese traditional art through constant innovation.

	Yang Hansheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, delivered a speech at the beginning of the joyful celebration reception, extending the warmest congratulations to all the artists of the Zenjinza Theatre Company. He said that from the very first day of its establishment, the Zenjinza Theatre Company took on the mission of developing Japan's progressive drama cause. Therefore, it has been subjected to constant destruction and persecution by reactionary forces on its path forward. However, after thirty years of severe trials, the Zenjinza Theatre Company still stands tall today with the broad support and care of the Japanese people, and has been continuously growing and developing. This is a great victory for the Zenjinza Theatre Company, and also a victory for the Japanese people. He said that the Chinese people and the Chinese literary and art circles will always be the most loyal friends of the Zenjinza Theatre Company.

	He pointed out that the Zenjinza Theatre Company, with its thirty years of practice, has opened up a broad and bright path in the Japanese literary and art world. We believe that the path of the Zenjinza Theatre Company is the path of Japanese drama workers. Although there will be many difficulties on this path, we are deeply convinced that for the Zenjinza Theatre Company, which has a history of thirty years of struggle, with the support of the powerful people's forces, it will surely be able to break through all obstacles, bravely and firmly along the right path, just as the red arrow of the Zenjinza Theatre Company's emblem shows, advance, advance, and advance forever!

	Guo Moruo, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, also delivered an enthusiastic impromptu speech. He wished the Japanese Zenjinza Theatre Company, like its name, to advance forever, and advance again. He proposed a toast to Zenjinza's eternal progress. At this moment, all the Chinese hosts attending the reception enthusiastically toasted with the head of the Zenjinza Theatre Company, Kawatake Chojuro, the deputy head, Nakamura Kanjakuemon, Miyagawa Gasei, and all the members of the company, as well as Saionji Kinkazu, a Japanese peace activist in Beijing.

	The artists of the Japanese Zenjinza and their Chinese hosts sat around the tables, all very excited and animated in their conversations. When the head of the company, Kawatake Chojuro, spoke, the venue erupted in applause. The head of the company said that on the occasion of celebrating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Zenjinza Theatre Company, Chinese friends held such a grand gathering for us, giving us brotherly and warm encouragement, for which we express our heartfelt gratitude and feel supreme honor.

	He spoke enthusiastically about how the days in China were the most glorious, fulfilling, and meaningful days in Zenjinza's thirty-year history. This is because we have seen the great construction of the new socialist China here; because Chinese friends embraced us with the warmth and enthusiasm of close brothers; because our theatre company's initial performances were successful, and senior Chinese literary and art figures and friends from all walks of life provided us with meticulous help.

	He spoke about the performances in Beijing, which achieved a stage effect that Zenjinza had never had before. He said that the audience and us seemed to have melted into one group. This feeling of the Chinese people is not just a matter for our theatre company alone, but because the friendly spirit of the peoples of Japan and China, the ardent expectation of restoring diplomatic relations, and the desire to strive for world peace are common. I am convinced that our friendship cannot be destroyed no matter how the decadent forces try to undermine it.

	At this joyful reception, the enthusiastic poems written by the Chinese hosts expressed their good wishes to the Japanese Zenjinza Theatre Company. Guo Moruo, with the bold and optimistic emotions of a poet, wrote: "Thirty-one years of red are united, with fire-like passion and ocean-like chest, striving to turn Penglai into a paradise, a new light brightly rises in the east." Mao Dun wrote: "Kabuki has been passed down for three hundred years, serving the people is what we see today, inheriting and developing new art, fighting for thirty years and moving forward step by step. Jointly safeguard the cause of peace, cultural exchanges connect what we have and what we lack, graceful dances and heroic songs proclaim our path, dawn wants to penetrate the eastern corner of the sea." Lao She's poem is: "Ancient drama opens a new history, with boundless brilliance, appearing boldly on stage, holding high our heads and defying the cold, the red glow reflects the dance, the white doves fly with the song, the east wind and the sky are vast, advancing and living a long life." Ouyang Yuqian wrote: "We are originally close brothers, gathering together with joy, looking forward to the light together, soaring together in the world, striving to advance together, working hard to see the main point, flowers compete with flowers in the spring, picking up the fragrance side by side."

	The reception became more and more lively, and the feelings of the hosts and guests were as intimate as milk and water. Many artists in the capital could not help but go on stage to perform many wonderful programs to add to the fun. There was a folk instrumental ensemble "Celebrating Longevity," there were clear chants by famous actors of various opera genres, there were solos by famous singers, and there were also musical dance programs. When the famous singer Wang Kun sang the Japanese folk song "Sakura Blooms," Japanese friends could not help but clap rhythmically. The artists of the Japanese Zenjinza Theatre Company also excitedly took the stage to perform, and their performance of the Chinese Peking Opera "Autumn River" was particularly warmly welcomed. This play was taught to the Zenjinza Theatre Company by the Peking Opera Troupe led by Mei Lanfang during its visit to Japan in 1956.

	Finally, the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the top ten literary and art organizations in the capital, as well as famous figures from the literary and art circles, presented gifts to the Zenjinza Theatre Company. Everyone's gifts expressed the common wish of the Chinese hosts: Wishing the Japanese Zenjinza Theatre Company eternal progress! (Image attached)

    祝日本前进座剧团永远前进
    首都文艺界集会庆祝前进座剧团成立三十周年
    新华社25日讯　本社记者报道：5月22日是日本前进座剧团成立三十周年纪念日。今天晚间，前进座的艺术家们同中国文艺界著名人士一起，欢乐地提前庆祝前进座剧团的诞生日。
    这是一个别具风格的中国传统习惯的祝寿会。在新侨饭店宴会厅的主席台正中，悬挂着前进座剧团的团徽，台前百花竞放。大厅里满墙诗画，灿烂夺目，这是中国主人给前进座的赠礼。当誉满北京的日本前进座艺术家们到达的时候，几百名中国主人和着“全世界人民心一条”的乐曲，长时期有节奏地热烈鼓掌。
    今晚，在对外文化协会、全国文联和戏剧家协会举行的庆祝酒会上，中国文艺界著名人士郭沫若、沈雁冰、阳翰笙、梅兰芳、许广平、夏衍、张致祥、丁西林、田汉、欧阳予倩、老舍、叶圣陶、邵荃麟、吕骥、马思聪、吴作人、马少波、张庚等，同优秀的日本艺术家们一起，共庆前进座剧团三十年来发扬日本民族戏剧传统和进步艺术的成就，祝愿他们继续高举前进的旗帜，为日本的独立、民主、和平、中立战斗不懈，并在不断革新中保持日本传统艺术的青春。
    中国人民对外文化协会副会长阳翰笙在欢乐的庆祝酒会开始的时候致词，向前进座剧团的全体艺术家们致最热烈的祝贺。他说，前进座剧团从建团的第一天起，就负起了发展日本进步戏剧事业的使命。因此，在前进的道路上遭到了反动势力不断的摧残和迫害，但是，前进座剧团经过三十年的严重考验，在日本人民的广泛支持和爱护下，今天仍然屹立着，并且获得了不断壮大和发展。这是前进座剧团的伟大胜利，同时也是日本人民的胜利。他说，中国人民和中国文艺界永远是前进座剧团最忠实的朋友。
    他指出，前进座剧团用自己三十年的实践，在日本文艺界中开辟了一条广阔和光明的道路。我们认为前进座剧团的道路，就是日本戏剧工作者的道路。虽然在这条道路上还将会碰到许多困难，但是，我们深信，对有着三十年奋斗历史的前进座剧团来说，在强大的人民力量的支持下，必定能够踏破一切阻拦，勇敢地、坚定不移地沿着正确的道路，正如前进座剧团团徽的红箭所显示的一样，前进，前进，永远前进！
    中国文学艺术界联合会主席郭沫若也热情地即席致词。他祝日本前进座剧团就像它的名称一样，永远前进，再前进。他提议为前进座永远前进干杯。这时候，出席酒会的全体中国主人，分别同前进座剧团团长河原崎长十郎、副团长中村翫右卫门、宫川雅青和全体团员以及在京的日本和平人士西园寺公一热情地干了杯。
    日本前进座的艺术家们和中国主人围桌相坐，他们都很兴奋，个个谈笑风生。当河原崎长十郎团长讲话的时候，会场掌声雷动。团长说，当迎接前进座剧团成立三十周年纪念的今天，中国的朋友们为我们举行如此盛大的集会，给予了我们以兄弟般的热烈的鼓励，对此我们表示衷心的谢意，并感到无上的光荣。
    他热情地谈到，在中国的日子，是前进座三十年的历史中最光荣、内容最充实、最有意义的日子。这是因为我们在这里看到了社会主义新中国伟大的建设情况；因为中国的朋友们以亲兄弟般的温暖热烈的手拥抱了我们；因为我们剧团最初的演出获得了成功，中国文艺界老前辈及各界朋友无微不至地帮助了我们。
    他谈到在北京的公演，获得了前进座过去从未有过的舞台效果。他说，观众和我们像熔成了一个团体一样。中国人民的这种感情，不单是我们一个剧团的问题，而是因为日中两国人民的友好精神，恢复邦交的热烈期望，争取世界和平的愿望是共同的。我确信，我们的这种友谊，腐朽势力怎样企图破坏也是破坏不了的。
    在这个欢乐的酒会上，中国主人们写的热情的诗词，表达了他们对日本前进座剧团的良好祝愿。郭沫若怀着豪放乐观的诗人情感写道：“春秋三十一团红，火样心情海样胸，争取蓬壶成乐土，新光杲杲旭升东。”茅盾写道：“歌舞伎传三百年，为民服务看今天，继承发展翔新艺，卅载斗争步步前。和平事业共维护，文化交流通有无，曼舞豪歌张我道，曙光欲透海东隅。”老舍的诗是：“古剧开新史，光芒万丈长，现身豪粉墨，昂首傲冰霜，舞障红霞映，歌云白鸽翔，东风天海阔，前进寿无疆。”欧阳予倩写道：“本是亲兄弟，欢欣聚一堂，光明同展望，天地共遨翔，奋发共先进，辛勤见主张，春来花竞花，并步撷芬芳。”
    酒会越来越热闹，宾主的感情水乳交融。首都的许多艺术家们情不自禁地登台表演了许多精采节目助兴。这里有民间器乐合奏“庆寿”，有各剧种著名演员的清唱，有著名歌唱家的独唱，也有音乐歌舞节目。当著名歌唱家王昆演唱日本民歌“樱花开了”的时候，日本朋友们情不自禁地有节奏地鼓掌。日本前进座剧团艺术家们也兴奋地登台表演，他们演出的中国京剧“秋江”，受到了特别热烈的欢迎。这个剧是1956年梅兰芳率领的京剧团访问日本时教给前进座剧团的。
    最后，中国人民对外文化协会和首都的十大文艺团体以及文艺界著名人士，向前进座剧团赠送了礼品。大家的礼品表达了中国主人的共同心愿：祝日本前进座剧团永远前进！（附图片）
