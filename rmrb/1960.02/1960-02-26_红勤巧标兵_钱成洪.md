Red Diligence and Ingenuity Vanguard – Qian Chenghong

    Because he humbly learns from advanced experiences and constantly innovates technology, his labor volume last year was equivalent to nine hundred and forty-three workdays; this year he wants to go further, increasing work efficiency by 12%, to contribute to the continued leap forward in agricultural production this year.

    (This report) According to our newspaper, Qian Chenghong, the deputy leader of the Ruanshi Production Team of the Meichi Commune in Zhuji, Zhejiang, and a Communist Party member, humbly learns from advanced experiences and constantly improves operating techniques. In the 1959 labor year (December 1958 to November 1959), he did a volume of labor equivalent to nine hundred and forty-three workdays.

    Qian Chenghong is twenty-seven years old this year. He started helping people herd cattle and geese at the age of nine, and became a young hired hand at the age of thirteen. After liberation, under the education of the Party, his political awareness rapidly increased. In the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, the amount of labor he did in a year was equivalent to five hundred and fifty-three workdays, becoming a well-known young labor model in Zhejiang Province. In the spring of 1959, the county held a five-level cadre meeting, and the Party Branch Secretary of the brigade, Shi Zhongxiang, said to him: "Chenghong, can the labor efficiency of your team be further improved? For example, a full laborer can do three to four hundred workdays a year." Chenghong said: "Yes! This year I guarantee to do six hundred and fifty workdays, and strive to reach seven hundred. I will also motivate all the team members to break through the three hundred mark and change the face of the Ruanshi Production Team!"

    Under the education and encouragement of the Party, Qian Chenghong's determination to improve work efficiency became even firmer. From then on, he devoted himself to studying technology and learning advanced experiences. Wherever there was advanced experience, he would delve into it. When the Zhejiang Daily published the rapid rice transplanting experience of the "Seven Fairies" of Huangyan, Qian Chenghong was overjoyed. In 1958, he had already reached an advanced level of transplanting 2.2 mu per day (row and plant spacing of 6×3 inches). However, he still felt that the speed was not fast enough and the quality was not good enough. At this time, the Party proposed row and plant spacing specifications of 5×2 inches and 5×3 inches, and he was determined to study diligently and practice hard. In the early morning, at dusk, at noon, and on moonlit nights, whenever there was a gap, he would practice his hand gestures, steps, eyesight, and waist strength, using rice straw and pine needles as seedlings. Sometimes at night, he would put snail shells in the yard to practice. When walking, and even when lying in bed, he would practice the gestures of dividing seedlings and transplanting rice. After twenty days of diligent study and hard practice, using more than seventy bundles of rice straw and more than thirty bundles of pine needles, he finally mastered a complete set of rapid experience in dense planting of rice. Not only did he transplant more, faster, and better, but he also reduced labor intensity without back pain, dizziness, or blurred vision.

    Qian Chenghong also paid close attention to constantly absorbing the strengths of others and improving his operating techniques. After he read about Bao Xiaoming's advanced deeds of doing the equivalent of more than six hundred and seventy workdays in a year, he read it again and again. Once, Qian Chenghong met Bao Xiaoming in Hangzhou. Qian Chenghong opened his mouth and asked: "My ashes don't burn thoroughly, and the ash pile gets smaller and smaller. What's wrong?" Bao Xiaoming introduced his manure accumulation experience in detail. It turned out that Bao Xiaoming waited until the mud piles were evenly stacked layer by layer before lighting the fire inside and out, attacking from both inside and outside, so the ashes burned thoroughly; but Qian himself lit the fire in the middle before the ash pile was stacked, igniting the firewood to burn through the core, which burned out quickly, and the surrounding mud was half-cooked. After learning Bao Xiaoming's ash-burning method, he quickly increased the amount from eight baskets per night to more than forty baskets, and the quality was also better, and his work efficiency caught up with Bao Xiaoming.

    Qian Chenghong actively used new-style tools in production. He participated in the Zhejiang Provincial Technology Promotion Group to Ningbo, saw a demonstration of rice harvesting with a large sickle, and immediately learned it; to Tiantai, the Tiantai County Agricultural Tool Reform Office gave him a fast harvesting machine, and he immediately used it after returning to the team, and the work efficiency was very high. Of course, his use of new-style tools was not so smooth. When he first used the double-share plow, he was not skilled, the plow was heavy, and both people and cattle were exhausted. However, under the encouragement of the Party Branch Secretary, he insisted on diligent study and hard practice, and also learned the technical experience of using double-share plows in Jiaxing County published in the newspaper, and finally achieved a high record of plowing eight mu and four fen of land a day with a double-share plow. Because he resolutely used the double-share plow, he motivated other commune members, so that all seven double-share plows in the team were put into use.

    Qian Chenghong not only worked hard, diligently, and cleverly himself, but also tried his best to pass on his advanced experience to others. This noble communist style was universally praised by the commune members. Now, sixty young men and women in the whole team have set off a heat wave of catching up with Qian Chenghong. Almost all of them have become highly efficient and red diligent and ingenious pacesetters. In 1959, their average labor volume was equivalent to six hundred and nineteen workdays. Among them, Fan Huaying, a member of the Communist Youth League, graduated from high school in 1958 and originally could not do anything. Later, with the active help of Qian Chenghong, she became an all-around expert in plowing, transplanting rice, twisting mud, and pulling carts, and won the fourth place in the county rice transplanting competition. She has become an activist in building socialism for young people in the Ningbo Prefecture. In 1959, six women in the team learned to twist mud, and fifty-eight women learned to transplant rice.

    Recently, at the Yangmeiqiao Reservoir construction site, a shock team of eighteen people led by Qian Chenghong has consistently been a high-efficiency red flag for the entire construction site. In the past month, the soil transportation efficiency of their team has risen linearly, from the initial average daily efficiency of 11.3 cubic meters per person to the recent 80.3 cubic meters. At the mobilization meeting of the water conservancy shock team, Qian Chenghong proposed to complete a year's workload in the two months of labor participating in the water conservancy project. Now, in the twenty-two days of labor at the reservoir, he has completed 638 cubic meters of soil, equivalent to 389 workdays, greatly ahead of schedule and overfulfilling the plan. This year, he is determined to increase work efficiency by 12% on the basis of last year, and the annual labor volume should be equivalent to one thousand and one hundred workdays, to dedicate all his strength to realizing a better and more comprehensive continued great leap forward in agricultural production in 1960.

    红勤巧标兵——钱成洪
    由于虚心学习先进经验，不断革新技术，他去年的劳动量相当九百四十三个劳动日；今年他要更上一层楼，提高工效12％，为今年农业生产继续跃进献出力量。
    本报讯　浙江诸暨湄池公社阮市生产队副队长、共产党员钱成洪，虚心学习先进经验，不断改进操作技术，在1959年劳动年度（1958年12月到1959年11月），做的劳动量相当于九百四十三个劳动日。
    钱成洪今年二十七岁，九岁起帮人放牛牧鹅，十三岁就当了小长工。解放后，在党的教育下，政治觉悟迅速提高。在大跃进的1958年，他一年中做的劳动量相当于五百五十三个劳动日，成为浙江全省闻名的青年劳动能手。1959年春天，县里召开五级干部会，大队党总支书记石钟祥对他说：“成洪，你们队的劳动工效是不是还能再提高一些？比方说，一个整劳动力全年做三四百个劳动日。”成洪说：“能！今年我保证做六百五十个劳动日，争取达到七百个。还要带动全队社员，一定突破三百大关，改变阮市生产队的面貌！”
    在党的教育与鼓励下，钱成洪提高工效的决心更坚定了。从此，他一股劲地钻研技术，学习先进经验，哪里有先进经验，他就往那里钻。浙江日报刊登了黄岩“七仙女”的快速插秧经验，钱成洪如获至宝。他在1958年就已达到日插二点二亩（行株距为6×3寸）的先进水平。但是，他还觉得速度还不够快，质量也不够好。这时党又提出行株距规格为5×2寸和5×3寸，他下定决心勤学苦练。清晨、黄昏、中午、月夜，有一点空隙，他就练手势、步子、眼力、腰劲，把稻草、松针当秧苗，有时夜里就在院子里摆螺蛳壳。走路时，甚至睡在床上，他也在练习分秧、插秧的手势。经过二十来天的勤学苦练，用了稻草七十多把、松毛三十多把，终于掌握了成套密植插秧的快速经验。他不但插得又多又快又好，而且腰不酸，头不晕，眼不花，减轻了劳动强度。
    钱成洪还十分注意不断地吸取别人的长处，改进自己的操作技术。他在报纸上看到鲍肖明一年做的劳动量相当六百七十多个劳动日的先进事迹以后，一读再读。一次，钱成洪在杭州和鲍肖明见面了，钱成洪开口就问：“我烧灰烧不透，灰堆越烧越小，是什么毛病？”鲍肖明详细介绍了自己的积肥经验。原来鲍肖明是等泥堆层层均匀垒好后，再里外点火，内外夹攻，因此灰烧得熟；而自己呢，灰堆还未垒好，中间就点火，引火柴穿心烧，一会儿就烧光了，周围的泥半生不熟。他学习鲍肖明的烧灰方法后，很快就由过去一夜烧八箩提高到四十多箩，质量也好了，工效赶上了鲍肖明。
    钱成洪在生产中积极使用新式工具。他参加浙江省技术推广团到宁波，看到大镰刀手表演割稻，他马上就学；到天台，天台县农具改革办公室送给他一台快速收割器，他回队后立即使用，工效很高。当然，他使用新式工具也并不是那么顺利的，开始使用双铧犁时技术不熟练，犁笨重，人吃力，牛也吃力。但是他在党总支书记的鼓励下，坚持勤学苦练，并且学习了报上登的嘉兴县使用双铧犁的技术经验，终于达到了用双铧犁一天耕田八亩四分的高纪录。由于他坚决使用双铧犁，带动了其他社员，使全队七台双铧犁全部使用起来。
    钱成洪不但自己苦干实干巧干，并且千方百计地把自己的先进经验传授给别人，这种高贵的共产主义风格，受到了社员们的普遍赞扬。现在全队六十个男女青年，掀起了猛赶钱成洪的热潮，他们几乎个个都成高工效能手和红勤巧标兵，他们在1959年平均劳动量相当六百十九个劳动日。其中有个女共青团员樊华英，1958年高小毕业，原来啥也不会做，后来在钱成洪的积极帮助下，成了耕田、插秧、捻泥和拉车的全能手，参加全县插秧比赛获得第四名，已成为宁波专区青年建设社会主义积极分子。1959年，全队有六个妇女学会捻泥，五十八个妇女学会插秧。
    最近，在杨梅桥水库工地上，钱成洪带领的一支十八人的突击队，一直是全工地高工效红旗。一个月来，他们队的运土工效直线上升，从开始的平均每人日工效十一点三方上升到最近的八十点三方。在水利突击队员誓师大会上，钱成洪提出要在参加水利工程两个月的劳动中，完成一年工作量；现在他在水库劳动的二十二天中，已做六百三十八方土，折合三百八十九个劳动日，大大提前超额完成计划。今年他决心在去年的基础上提高工效12％，全年劳动量要相当一千一百个劳动日，为实现1960年农业生产更好更全面的继续大跃进而献出自己的全部力量。
