Xinhua News Agency, Havana, February 3rd: Cuban newspapers continue to condemn Eisenhower's statement at the Washington press conference, believing that the United States is attempting to launch an armed attack against Cuba under the guise of anti-communism.

The "Hoy" newspaper published an editorial on February 2nd pointing out that the current American attacks on Cuba are being carried out under the pretext of opposing "communism," with the primary goal of using anti-communist propaganda, followed by armed aggression, to attack the Castro government.

In refuting Eisenhower's slander that attributed the tension in Cuban-American relations to a "communist conspiracy," the newspaper emphasized that anti-imperialist sentiment was by no means caused by the reasons Eisenhower mentioned, but rather by the United States' trampling on the sovereignty of other countries. In Cuba, the growth of anti-imperialist sentiment is due to the United States' brutal attacks on Cuba.

An editorial in "Revolución" today pointed out that the United States is attempting to isolate Cuba with the hackneyed anti-communist excuse, so that Washington can smoothly launch an armed aggression against Cuba.

"Revolución" pointed out that the United States' agents in Latin America—the likes of former Costa Rican President Figueres—recently held a so-called "Defense of Democracy" conference in Costa Rica, which was part of a conspiracy against Cuba. The newspaper went on to say that counter-revolutionaries also planned to hold an "anti-communist" meeting recently in Havana's Central Park, and have the organizers of the meeting themselves attack it, with the aim of blaming the Castro government, thereby accusing it of carrying out terrorist persecution. The counter-revolutionaries are attempting to find a reason to justify the invasion plan in this way. "Revolución" emphasized that this is "the fox's tail that the (American) President who plays golf recently revealed in his statement."

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 3rd: The Soviet "Izvestia" published an article today exposing the crimes of American interference in Cuban internal affairs.

The article said that American newspapers have been intensifying their pressure and slander against Cuba in the first few weeks of this year. American news agencies have been promoting the idea that the "basis" for American armed intervention in Cuba is the discovery of "communist dangers" in Cuba. Among the many American officials participating in this slander campaign is U.S. Vice President Nixon.

The article, in discussing why the United States is loudly clamoring about the deterioration of U.S.-Cuba relations and blaming the Castro government for this, said that it is because the Republic of Cuba is determined to carry out the revolutionary cause to the end, and land reform and the elimination of foreign capital are progressing smoothly domestically. The United States has a large amount of investment in Cuba, and American monopoly capital owns the largest and best sugar enterprises in Cuba. Therefore, when the Cuban people decided to recover the wealth illegally taken from them, Washington panicked.

The article concluded by saying that the U.S. note to the Cuban government on January 11th crudely violated Cuba's legitimate rights. This is a signal for a new attack on Cuba.

    艾森豪威尔的反共烟幕骗不了人
    古巴报纸揭穿美国侵略阴谋
    苏联“消息报”斥责美国干涉古巴的罪行
    新华社哈瓦那3日电　古巴报纸继续谴责艾森豪威尔在华盛顿记者招待会上发表的声明，认为美国企图在反共的烟幕下发动对古巴的武装进攻。
    “今日报”2日发表的一篇社论指出，目前美国对古巴的攻击是在反对“共产主义”的借口下进行的，其目的首先在于利用反共宣传，随后再用武装侵略来进攻卡斯特罗政府。
    在驳斥艾森豪威尔把古巴和美国关系的紧张归罪于“共产主义阴谋”的谰言时，这家报纸强调指出，反帝情绪绝不是艾森豪威尔所说的那些理由引起的，而是由于美国对别的国家主权的蹂躏造成的。在古巴，反帝情绪的增长就是由于美国对古巴所进行的粗暴攻击。
    “战斗报”今天的一篇社论指出，美国企图以陈腐的反共借口来孤立古巴，以便使华盛顿方面能顺利发动对古巴的武装侵略。
    “战斗报”指出，美国在拉丁美洲的代理人——哥斯达黎加前总统菲格雷斯之流最近在哥斯达黎加举行的所谓保卫民主代表大会就是反对古巴的阴谋的一部分。报纸接着说，反革命分子还计划最近在哈瓦那中央公园举行“反共”会议，并且由这个会议本身的组织者来攻击这次会议，其目的是把责任归咎于卡斯特罗政府，从而指责它进行恐怖迫害。反革命分子企图这样来为侵略计划寻找辩护的理由。“战斗报”强调指出，这就是“玩高尔夫球的（美国）总统最近声明中露出来的狐狸尾巴”。
    新华社莫斯科3日电　苏联“消息报”今天发表文章，揭露美国干涉古巴内政的罪行。
    文章说，美国报刊在今年头几个星期内又在加紧对古巴施加压力和进行诬蔑。美国通讯社宣扬说，可以作为美国武装干涉古巴的“根据”是，在古巴发现了“共产主义危险”。参加这一诬蔑活动的美国许多国家负责人中也有美国副总统尼克松。
    文章在谈到为什么美国大事叫嚷古美关系恶化，并把这一点归罪卡斯特罗政府时说，这是因为古巴共和国坚决要把革命事业进行到底，国内正在顺利地进行土地改革和排除外国资本的斗争。而美国在古巴有大量投资，美国垄断资本占有古巴最大最好的制糖企业。因此，当古巴人民决定要把这些非法从他们手中夺去的财富收回时，华盛顿就惊惶失措了。
    文章最后说，美国1月11日给古巴政府的照会粗暴地侵犯了古巴的合法权利。这是对古巴进行新的进攻的信号。
