　　Teahouse or Tavern?

　　When Eisenhower made no mention of the planned East-West summit meeting in May in his "State of the Union Address," the question was raised: What contribution is the United States prepared to make to the future East-West summit meeting? Now, this question seems to be answerable.

　　A United Press International dispatch from Washington on January 30 stated: "The Eisenhower administration, with the help of the French and West German governments, has begun a propaganda campaign to prepare the public for the failure of the May Four-Power summit meeting." It pointed out that on January 29, three speeches were given in Washington on this issue. The three speakers were the West German Ambassador to the United States, Grewe, the French Ambassador to the United States, Alphand, and the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, Berding. They sang in unison at a women's group meeting, talking about how the Paris meeting "will not bring peace, or even the beginning of peaceful relations between the Communist and non-Communist blocs," urging people not to "have excessive hopes" for the meeting, and that "the four powers should not expect to make a final decision on major Cold War issues at one meeting," etc. United Press International also revealed that "State Department officials will deliver more speeches related to this kind of warning in the next three months."

　　Before the East-West summit meeting has even taken place, they are doing their utmost to pour cold water on the meeting. This is the contribution that the U.S. government is prepared to make to the East-West summit meeting.

　　Why is the American ruling clique so keen on spreading pessimistic air about the East-West summit meeting? United Press International said that this is because "Republican leaders are concerned that if the Paris meeting is deadlocked, or worse, it will damage the Republican Party's election platform of 'peace and prosperity' if voters place too much hope on this meeting." Some American newspapers have already pointed out that one of the motivations for the Republican government to agree to hold the East-West summit meeting was to deceive voters and win their support in future elections. Now, for the same reason, the Republican government is doing its best to prepare voters in advance for the failure of the East-West meeting. It is not difficult to understand how much sincerity the American ruling clique has towards the East-West summit meeting.

　　U.S. Secretary of State Herter stated some time ago that the East-West summit meeting should become a series of meetings. Western news agencies have pointed out that the U.S. strategy is to turn the meeting into a teahouse meeting that does not solve problems. Now it seems more appropriate to say that the United States wants to turn the meeting into a tavern meeting. Because according to Western customs, a drunkard in a tavern should be forgiven even if he does something unreasonable. The American ruling clique wants to engage in large-scale "don't say you weren't warned" propaganda, entirely as a prelude to obstructing the meeting in the future. Isn't this very clear?

### 茶馆乎？酒馆乎？

    茶馆乎？酒馆乎？
    艾森豪威尔在他的“国情咨文”中对于预定在今年5月举行的东西方最高级会议只字未提，当时就有人提出这样的疑问：美国究竟准备在未来的东西方最高级会议中作出什么样的贡献呢？现在，这个问题似乎是可以得到解答了。
    合众国际社1月30日从华盛顿发出的一则电讯说：“艾森豪威尔政府在法国和西德政府的帮助下已经开始了一个使公众对5月的四大国最高级会议有失败的准备的宣传运动”。它指出，在1月29日有人在华盛顿对这个问题发表了三篇演说。这三个人是西德驻美大使格雷韦，法国驻美大使阿尔芳和美国助理国务卿伯丁，他们在一个妇女团体会议上一唱一和地大谈什么巴黎会议“将不会带来和平，或者甚至不会带来共产党和非共产党集团之间的和平关系的开端”，要人们不要对会议“抱过份的希望”，“不应该期望四大国在一次会议上对重大的冷战问题作出最后的决定”等等。合众国际社并且透露，“国务院官员们在今后三个月内将发表更多的有关这种警告的演说。”
    在东西方最高级会议尚未举行之前，就竭尽其力给会议泼冷水，这就是美国政府准备给东西方最高级会议所作的贡献。
    美国统治集团为什么要这样热中于给东西方最高级会议散布悲观空气呢？合众国际社说，这是因为“共和党的首脑们担心，如果巴黎会议陷于僵局或者更坏的话，这将会损害共和党的‘和平和繁荣’的选举纲领，要是选民们对这次会议寄予太多的期望的话。”美国的一些报纸早经指出，为了在未来的选举中骗取选民的支持，是共和党政府同意举行东西方最高级会议的动机之一。现在为了同样的原因，共和党政府竭力使选民预先对东西方会议的失败作好思想准备。这就不难了解，美国统治集团对于东西方最高级会议究竟有几分诚意了。
    美国国务卿赫脱前些时候就表示东西方最高级会议应当成为一系列的会议。西方通讯社曾指出，美国的策略是要把会议开成不解决问题的茶馆会议。现在看来，不如说美国是要把会议开成为酒馆会议更恰当些。因为按照西方的习惯，一个在酒馆中的酒徒，即使作了蛮横无理的坏事，也是应当能够得到人们原谅的。美国统治集团要大搞“勿谓言之不预”的宣传，完全是为了作为以后在会议中进行阻挠的伏笔，这不是很明白的吗？
