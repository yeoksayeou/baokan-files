    To achieve a new, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in our agricultural production this year on the basis of continuous leaps forward for two years, we must first strive for a bumper harvest of summer crops. This is because the output of summer crops accounts for about one-third of the total output of agricultural crops for the year, and a bumper harvest of summer crops will lay the foundation for a bumper harvest for the whole year. Wheat has the largest planting area among summer crops, so to strive for a bumper harvest of summer crops, we must mainly strive for a bumper harvest of wheat. Of course, we must not neglect to strive for a bumper harvest of rapeseed and summer miscellaneous grains.
    Judging from the growth process of wheat, the upcoming greening stage has a decisive impact on whether wheat can have a bumper harvest. If the greening stage of wheat is managed well, the tillers before winter can be consolidated, the effective tillers will increase, the ears of wheat will grow bigger and longer, and the yield will be higher. If the greening stage is not managed well, and the nutrients and water needed by wheat during the greening period are insufficient, it will affect the growth and development of wheat and reduce the yield. Whether wheat can pass the greening stage well depends on preparing sufficient water and fertilizer for wheat greening, and having enough manpower to irrigate, fertilize, cultivate, and harrow the wheat in time. Therefore, making preparations for the wheat greening stage in advance is a very important task in striving for a bumper summer harvest. After the wheat basically passed the wintering stage, Yanshi County in Henan Province, based on the local wheat growth situation, put forward the slogan of launching a fierce attack on the wheat greening stage during the "Beginning of Spring" season, launched a red flag competition movement centered on making full preparations for wheat greening in advance, carried out large-scale farmland irrigation projects, accumulated a lot of fertilizer, and rushed to make tools. They also carefully arranged labor, implemented short-term contracting during the wheat greening period, and strengthened inspections. This approach of Yanshi County, which always takes the initiative in work and strives for a bumper wheat harvest with practical and concrete actions, will surely bear fruitful results.
    When preparing water and fertilizer and strengthening field management for wheat greening, it is of great significance to especially strengthen the management of some poor fields, distant fields, and late-sown fields, applying fertilizer and watering according to the seedlings' condition, and promoting the upgrading of wheat seedlings for wheat yield increase. In the past, distant fields and poor fields were generally poorly managed, and less fertilizer was applied, so the foundation was weak; late-sown fields were relatively rough when cultivated because the stubble was cleared late. The wheat seedlings in these fields generally do not grow very well, and mostly belong to the second and third categories of seedlings. Although there are not many such wheat fields in various places, there are some, and they add up to a considerable number. If these wheat fields are not specially managed, implementing extra water and fertilizer, and supplementing whatever is lacking, and the wheat seedlings cannot be upgraded, this year's wheat yield per unit area and total output will be affected. It can be seen that grasping the key period of wheat growth—the greening period—and breaking through the weak links—strengthening the field management of distant fields, poor fields, and late-sown fields—will have a great effect on striving for a bumper wheat harvest this year. The Xiangcheng County Party Committee saw this point in the winter wheat field management work, so it first focused the wheat field management on grasping the "three fields" (distant slope fields, hill fields, and late-sown fields) to promote the upgrading of the second and third categories of seedlings. Subsequently, on the basis of grasping the "three fields," they put forward the slogan of grasping the "six fields" (command fields, high-yield fields, distant slope fields, hill fields, late-sown fields, and pest- and disease-damaged fields) and launched the wheat field management work during the wheat greening period. This method of wheat field management, which breaks through one point and drives the overall situation, grasps both ends and brings along the middle, is very worthy of attention.

### 抓关键时期　抓薄弱环节

    抓关键时期　抓薄弱环节
    今年我们的农业生产，要在连续两年跃进的基础上继续跃进。要实现新的更好更全面的跃进，首先就得争取夏收作物丰收。因为夏收作物产量占全年农作物产量的三分之一左右，夏收作物取得丰收，就为全年丰收奠定了基础。夏收作物中种植面积最大的是小麦，要争取夏收作物丰收，主要是争取小麦丰收。当然，也不能忽视争取油菜和夏杂粮等作物的丰收。
    根据小麦生长过程来看，即将到来的返青关对小麦能不能丰收有决定性的影响。小麦返青关过得好，冬前的分蘖就能巩固，有效分蘖就会增多，麦穗就会长得更多更大更长，产量就会更高。如果返青关过得不好，小麦在返青期需要的养分和水分供应不足，就会影响小麦的生长发育，降低产量。小麦能不能过好返青关，关键在于为小麦返青准备下充足的水分和肥料，而且有足够的人力及时地对小麦进行灌溉、施肥和中耕、耙耱等。因此，提前为小麦过返青关作好准备，是当前争取夏季丰收的一项很重要的工作。河南偃师县在小麦基本渡过越冬关以后，根据当地小麦生长的情况，提出在“立春”时节就开始猛攻小麦返青关的口号，展开了以提前为小麦返青做好充分准备为中心的红旗竞赛运动，大搞田间灌溉工程，大积肥料，赶制工具。并且还认真安排劳力，实行了小麦返青期间的小段包工、加强检查等。偃师县这种在工作上时时打主动仗，用切实具体的行动力争小麦丰收的作法，一定会结出丰硕的果实。
    在为小麦返青准备水、肥和加强田间管理的时候，对一些薄田、远田和晚茬田特别加强管理，看苗施肥、浇水，促进麦苗升级，对小麦增产有很大的意义。远田、薄田过去一般管理较差，施肥也较少，底子薄；晚茬田由于腾茬晚，耕种时比较粗放，这些田里的麦苗一般都长得不大好，大多属于二、三类苗。这样的麦田各地虽然不多，但都有一些，加起来就是一个相当大的数字。如果对这些麦田不加以特殊的管理，实行偏水、偏肥，缺啥补啥，麦苗不能升级，今年小麦的单位面积产量和总产量都将受到影响。可见，抓紧小麦生长的关键时期——返青期，突破薄弱环节——加强对远田、薄田、晚茬田的田间管理，对争取今年小麦丰收有很大作用。襄城县委在冬季麦田管理的工作中看到了这一点，因而首先把麦田管理的重点放在狠抓“三田”（远坡田、山岗田、晚茬田）上，促使二、三类苗升级。随后又在狠抓“三田”的基础上，提出了狠抓“六田”（指挥田、丰产田、远坡田、山岗田、晚茬田、病虫危害田）的口号，展开了小麦返青期的麦田管理工作。这种突破一点、带动全面，抓两头、带中间的麦田管理方法，是很值得重视的。
