    Implementing the "Eight-Character Charter"—The Primary Task of Scientific Research Activities in People's Communes

    Rural agricultural scientific research activities should take the implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" as the guiding principle. In this way, we can more effectively and systematically solve the various key problems in the development of production in the People's Communes, and promote agriculture to continuously leap forward at high speed.

    Some people say that the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture has already put forward clear measures for increasing production, and we just need to implement them accordingly. Why is it necessary to engage in scientific research on the "Eight-Character Charter" on a large scale? It is true that the "Eight-Character Charter" is a fundamental law that must be implemented in all departments of agricultural production, and it is a universal truth in agricultural science that "applies to all corners of the world." The high yield of all crops cannot be separated from these eight characters. However, first, each of the eight characters of the "Eight-Character Charter"—soil, fertilizer, water, seeds, close planting, protection, tools, and management—has its own rich content and its own laws. Only through scientific research and continuous exploration can we better grasp, apply, and develop it. For example, whether it is the accumulation or the application of fertilizer, it is a science worth studying and exploring. Second, in different regions, different seasons, and different crops, because of the differences in soil quality, climate, light, wind direction, and farming conditions, the implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" cannot be uniform. There should be different specific rules and different specific measures. The in-depth solution to this problem cannot but rely on science. Only by constantly summarizing the experience of high yields in the specific implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter," and constantly seeking and clarifying the various types of high-yield laws that are suitable for local conditions, suitable for the season, and suitable for the crop, can we creatively and comprehensively implement the "Eight-Character Charter" and promote the leap forward in agricultural production. Third, the eight characters of the "Eight-Character Charter"—soil, fertilizer, water, seeds, close planting, protection, tools, and management—are not isolated, but are an integral whole that is interconnected, interdependent, mutually coordinated, and mutually promoted. In the implementation of the Eight-Character Charter, the important task of scientific research is to understand each character individually and at the same time to clarify the relationship between them, so as to use their laws to drive and promote each other. For example, after close planting, the plowing, fertilization, and water conservancy conditions cannot remain the same, and must be reformed. Once the amount of fertilizer is increased, a series of problems arise, such as how to transport a large amount of fertilizer to the fields, and a new scene of carts transporting fertilizer appears; seeds must also be sought that are both fertilizer-resistant and high-yielding; with sufficient fertilizer and thick stalks, in order to ensure more ears and more grains, it is necessary to study the rational combination of various fertilizers. For example, as the density of rice planting increases, a contradiction arises between the customary speed of rice planting and timely rice planting, which promotes the creation and invention of rice planting tools; as the seedlings grow densely, the technology of field management and pest control must also be reformed. Here, contradictions are revealed and resolved, and there, contradictions arise again; this contradiction is resolved, and new contradictions follow. The resolution of each contradiction is a revolution in the old farming habits, and new farming technology experiences are created, pushing forward the old and bringing forth the new, and production technology is advanced. And contradictions are endless, the revolution in production technology is constantly developing, and production is constantly improving. Therefore, the "Eight-Character Charter" is a revolutionary agricultural science with extremely rich content, which requires us to conduct arduous and meticulous exploration and research, to understand and grasp it in scientific terms, in order to better apply it in practice. Whoever strives the most in scientific research will create and harvest the most in production practice; conversely, if one holds a lazy attitude and thinks that the "Eight-Character Charter" is simple and there is nothing to study, then he will never recognize the huge theoretical and practical significance of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production, and he will inevitably be confined to old and outdated farming habits and will not be able to innovate and move forward.

    Since serving and promoting production is the fundamental task of agricultural scientific research, scientific research work should be carried out around the "Eight-Character Charter." It should also be particularly emphasized here that this research must mobilize and rely on the masses, because the broad masses of commune members are the practitioners of production and the specific implementers of the "Eight-Character Charter." Only by mobilizing them to participate can our rural scientific research work have a foundation. Therefore, we require the Party committees of each commune to boldly mobilize the masses, enthusiastically support every scientific measure of the masses in the implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter," and publicize their achievements, no matter how small. Organize agricultural scientific research departments to cooperate closely with the masses, enlighten the masses with scientific principles, and help them summarize their experiences and improve their understanding. Only in this way can the Eight-Character Charter be mastered by the masses and exert its power in production.

    In order to realize the continued and comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production this year, a vigorous spring plowing preparation movement is underway in various places. The scientific research activities of the People's Communes in various places should seize the time, combine with the spring plowing preparation movement, summarize the specific experiences of implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" last year, study the high-yield laws of various crops and different natural conditions, and fully utilize these experiences and laws to formulate specific measures for further implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" this year, further deepen the mass scientific research activities, and strive for a larger area and a higher amount of bumper harvests this year.

### 贯彻“八字宪法”—人民公社科学研究活动的首要任务

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    贯彻“八字宪法”—人民公社科学研究活动的首要任务
    农村的农业科学研究活动应当以贯彻“八字宪法”为纲，这样，就可以更集中更系统地来解决人民公社生产发展中的各个关键问题，推动农业不断高速度地跃进。
    有的人说，农业“八字宪法”已经提出了明确的增产措施，我们照着执行就是了，为什么还要大搞“八字宪法”的科学研究呢？不错，“八字宪法”是农业生产的各个部门都必须贯彻的根本大法，是农业科学上的“放之四海而皆准”的普遍真理，所有农作物的丰产都离不开这八个字。但是，第一、“八字宪法”的八个字——土、肥、水、种、密、保、工、管，每个字都各有其丰富的内容，也都有其本身的规律，只有通过科学研究加以不断的探讨，才能更好地掌握它，运用它，并且发展它。例如，不论肥料的积造或肥料的施用都是一门值得加以研究、探讨的科学。第二、在各个不同地区、各个不同季节和各种不同作物，因为土质、气候、光照、风向以及耕作条件的不同，执行“八字宪法”就不可能是千篇一律的，而应当有其不同的具体规律和不同的具体措施。这个问题的深入解决，就不能不依靠科学。只有不断总结具体执行“八字宪法”的丰产经验，不断地寻求和阐明因地制宜、因时制宜、因作物制宜的各种类型的丰产规律，才能创造性地全面贯彻“八字宪法”，促进农业生产的跃进。第三、“八字宪法”的八个字——土、肥、水、种、密、保、工、管，每一个字都不是孤立的，而是互相联系、互相依赖、互相配合、互相推动的整体。在贯彻八字宪法中，科学研究的重要任务就是要一个字一个字分别摸底，同时又弄清它们之间的相互关系，以便运用其规律，使之互相带动、互相促进。比如，密植以后，翻土、施肥量、水利条件，照老样子就不行了，就得改革。施肥量一增加，又出现了一连串的问题，如大量肥料怎样赶运下田，于是出现了车子运肥的新景象；种子也得寻求既耐肥又高产的品种；肥足秆粗，为了保证结穗多、出粒多，又得研究各类肥料的合理配合问题。再如插秧的密度提高了，还产生了插秧习惯进度与适时插秧的矛盾，于是推动了插秧工具的创造发明；禾苗长得密了，田间管理和防治病虫害的技术也得改革。这里矛盾被揭示和解决了，那里又出现矛盾；这个矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又跟着发生。每一个矛盾的解决，也就是对旧的耕作习惯进行一次革命，又创造了新的耕作技术经验，推陈出新，生产技术就向前推进一步。而矛盾无穷，生产技术革命也就不断发展，生产也随着不断提高。所以说，“八字宪法”是革命的农业科学，它有极其丰富的内容，需要我们进行艰苦、细致的探索、研究，在科学道理上去认识和掌握它，才能在实践上更好地运用它。谁在科学研究上努力得最多，谁就能在生产实践上创造最多，收获最多；相反，如果持懒汉的思想和态度，认为“八字宪法”简简单单没有什么可以研究，那么，他将永远不会认识“八字宪法”对农业生产的巨大的理论意义和实践意义，他势必囿于旧的不合时宜的耕作习惯不能革新，而不能前进。
    服务和促进生产既然是农业科学研究的根本任务，就应当围绕“八字宪法”来开展科学研究工作。这里还应当特别强调的是：这种研究必须发动和依靠群众，因为广大社员是生产的实践者，是“八字宪法”的具体执行者，只有发动他们参加，我们农村的科学研究工作才有基础。因此，要求我们每个公社的党委，放手发动群众，满腔热情地支持群众在贯彻“八字宪法”中的每一个科学措施，宣扬他们一点一滴的成就。组织农业科学研究部门密切地和群众合作，以科学道理启发群众，帮助他们总结经验，提高认识。只有这样，八字宪法才能为群众所掌握，在生产中发挥它的威力。
    为了实现今年农业生产的继续全面跃进，目前，轰轰烈烈的春耕准备运动正在各地进行。各地人民公社的科学研究活动，应当抓紧时间，结合备耕运动，总结去年执行“八字宪法”的具体经验，研究各种不同作物、不同自然条件的丰产规律，并充分运用这些经验和规律，制订出今年进一步执行“八字宪法”的具体措施，进一步深入开展群众性的科学研究活动，争取今年更大面积和更高额的丰收。
