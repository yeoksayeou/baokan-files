Xinhua News Agency, February 24th. Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, sent a telegram to Salvador, General Secretary of the Cuban Trade Union, on February 24th, severely condemning the US bombing of Cuba.

The telegram stated: "Chinese workers are extremely indignant at the barbaric crimes of US planes continuously bombing Cuban sugar mills and sugarcane fields, and severely condemn the US imperialists' deliberate sabotage of the Cuban people's peaceful construction and intensified conspiracy to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs and carry out aggression. We resolutely support the Cuban people's just struggle to safeguard national sovereignty, implement land reform, and develop the national economy."

The telegram pointed out: "The US government, unable to deny its crimes, hypocritically apologized to the Cuban government, but continues to bomb Cuban peaceful land, and Eisenhower himself personally stepped forward to intensify conspiracies in Latin America, attempting to isolate Cuba in order to achieve the conspiracy to subvert the Cuban revolutionary government. This further exposes its deliberate and sinister intention to be enemies with the Cuban people to the end." The telegram stated: "We firmly believe that with the firm support of the people of Latin America and the world, the Cuban people will surely be able to defeat all aggressive activities of US imperialism and ultimately achieve victory."

Xinhua News Agency, February 24th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions today asked the Cuban Trade Union to forward a telegram to Puerto Rican workers, protesting the US colonial authorities' brutal torture of Campos, leader of the Puerto Rican independence movement.

The telegram stated: "Chinese workers have learned with extreme anger of the barbaric acts of the US colonial authorities in unreasonably imprisoning and brutally torturing Campos, leader of the Puerto Rican independence movement, and strongly condemn US imperialism's insistence on implementing colonial rule over Puerto Rico and suppressing the Puerto Rican national independence movement."

The telegram stated: "Chinese workers resolutely support the just struggle of Puerto Rican workers and people for national independence and against US imperialism, and demand that the US colonial authorities immediately release Campos and other imprisoned patriotic fighters. We firmly believe that with the support of the people of Latin America and the world, the Puerto Rican people's struggle for independence will ultimately achieve victory."

    刘宁一致电古巴工联总书记指出
    古巴人民必能击败美国侵略

    新华社24日讯　中华全国总工会主席刘宁一24日打电报给古巴工联总书记萨尔瓦多，严厉谴责美国飞机轰炸古巴。
    电报说：“中国工人对美国飞机连续轰炸古巴糖厂和甘蔗园的野蛮罪行极为愤慨，并严厉谴责美帝国主义蓄意破坏古巴人民和平建设、加紧进行干涉古巴内政和进行侵略的阴谋活动，坚决支持古巴人民维护民族主权、实行土地改革和发展国民经济的正义斗争。”
    电报指出：“美国政府在无法抵赖其罪行的情况下，虚伪地向古巴政府道歉，但仍然继续对古巴和平土地进行轰炸，并由艾森豪威尔亲自出马加紧在拉丁美洲进行阴谋活动，企图孤立古巴，以达到颠复古巴革命政府的阴谋，这就进一步暴露出其蓄意与古巴人民为敌到底的罪恶意图。”电报说：“我们深信，在拉丁美洲和全世界人民的坚决支持下，古巴人民一定能够击败美帝国主义的一切侵略活动，最后取得胜利。”
    新华社24日讯　中华全国总工会今天请古巴工联转给波多黎各工人一份电报，抗议美国殖民当局残酷拷打波多黎各独立运动领袖坎波斯的野蛮行为。
    电报说：“中国工人极其愤怒地获悉美国殖民当局无理监禁和残酷拷打波多黎各独立运动领袖坎波斯的野蛮行为，并强烈谴责美帝国主义坚持对波多黎各实行殖民统治和镇压波多黎各民族独立运动的罪行。”
    电报说：“中国工人坚决支持波多黎各工人和人民争取民族独立、反对美帝国主义的正义斗争，并要求美国殖民当局立即释放坎波斯及其他被监禁的爱国志士。我们深信，在拉丁美洲和全世界人民支援下，波多黎各人民争取独立的斗争最后必将取得胜利。”
