Moving a Thousand Mountains, Opening Rivers for Ten Thousand Li
Zhang Bosen, Standing Committee Member of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Governor of Hunan Province

The great people's commune has opened up a new situation in large-scale production. Its characteristics in Hunan Province's water conservancy construction last winter and this spring are: unified planning, basin management, mountain and water management, comprehensive development, comprehensive utilization, and beautification of mountains and rivers. The scale of water conservancy construction has grown from small to large, to a combination of large, medium, and small sizes; the scope has expanded from water management to soil management, to water, mountain, and soil management combined, and overall planning, comprehensive management, and multi-purpose water use have been achieved. This has brought the province's water conservancy construction into a new stage.

In the two months from the end of October to the end of last year, the earth and stone work completed in Hunan Province's water conservancy movement was equivalent to 40% of the total earth and stone work completed in the province's water conservancy over the past ten years since liberation. In those two months, more than 800,000 water conservancy projects were completed throughout the province. The increased water storage capacity of all completed projects is 90% of the total water storage capacity of the province's existing water conservancy facilities. This will increase the area of farmland guaranteed for double-cropping rice from 14 million mu last year to 28 million mu, and will also transform 1 million mu of dry land into fertile land, and 14 million mu of "heaven-fed fields" into self-flowing irrigation; flood control capacity will also be greatly improved.

Currently, all localities are concentrating their main efforts to complete 130 large and medium-sized water conservancy projects in the shortest possible time. The number of large and medium-sized projects newly built last winter and this spring has more than doubled the total number built in the ten years since liberation. Many counties have established large and medium-sized main projects in small reservoir groups, and auxiliary small projects around the main reservoirs, using canals to connect the main projects and auxiliary projects into a unified irrigation and drainage system, achieving interconnected ponds and reservoirs, long vines bearing melons, all waters returning to the source, and comprehensive utilization, forming a magnificent picture of transforming nature and beautifying mountains and rivers. At present, preliminary management has been carried out on more than 200 of the province's 800-plus larger rivers according to basin planning.

Launch a Mass Movement

Such high-speed water conservancy construction is a miracle that has appeared for the first time in the history of water conservancy construction in Hunan.

We first realized that taking the Party's mass line as the guiding ideology for carrying out water conservancy work, earnestly implementing the central government's water management policy, and launching a large-scale mass movement are the keys to carrying out water conservancy construction at high speed. Because water conservancy construction covers a wide area and involves a large number of projects, only by fully mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, pooling the wisdom of the masses, can we solve the problems of manpower, materials, funds, and technology in large-scale water conservancy construction, and can we solve the contradictions between upstream and downstream, left and right banks, and benefiting and non-benefiting units, and build water conservancy undertakings at high speed. The actual situation is exactly like this: last winter and this spring, although the state's investment in water conservancy construction only accounted for 13% of the total investment in the ten years since liberation, the number of large and small water conservancy projects completed was more than 200,000 more than the total built in the ten years since liberation; among them, more than 29,000 new small reservoirs were built, which is 60% more than the total number of reservoirs built in the ten years since liberation; and after the recent mass water conservancy inspection and acceptance, 95% of the completed water conservancy projects meet the engineering quality standards, and more than 80% of the reservoirs are completed as a whole, achieving completed dams and open canals.

Only by Winning Time Can We Seize the Initiative

Secondly, the leadership's grasp of the current excellent situation, full of energy, and striving for the upper reaches is the fundamental reason for the high-speed development of water conservancy construction in the province last winter and this spring. In August last year, all parts of the province conscientiously implemented the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and after opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting energy, further adhered to putting politics in command, liberated people's thinking, and a vigorous and excellent situation emerged in the vast rural areas of the province. The provincial party committee analyzed the province's political situation at that time: righteousness was rising, evil was declining, and the Party's unity was unprecedentedly strengthened; the economic situation was: a production upsurge, a brand-new atmosphere, economic prosperity, and booming trade, which was an excellent time to carry out farmland capital construction.

At the beginning of the movement, the provincial party committee believed that the central link in grasping the excellent situation of the water conservancy movement at that time was to seize time. Only by winning time and completing the plan ahead of schedule would it be possible to dispatch most of the labor force on the water conservancy front to invest in winter production work such as fertilizer accumulation, afforestation, and wasteland reclamation. Therefore, the provincial party committee, based on the situation at that time and the experience of water conservancy construction in previous years, put forward the requirements of "four earlies" (early preparation, early start, early completion, and early benefit) and "four guarantees" (guarantee quality, guarantee safety, guarantee economy, and guarantee health) for building water conservancy projects in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. Last winter, the start of water conservancy construction throughout the province was generally one or two months earlier than in previous years. To achieve this, in addition to early preparation and early start, it is also necessary to comprehensively arrange the labor force and ensure that the central focus is prominent in a certain period. At the beginning of the province's water conservancy movement in late October last year, the provincial party committee clearly put forward that rural work in the next two or three months should focus on water conservancy construction. It required all localities to proceed from their local actual conditions, distinguish the primary and secondary order of tasks, adopt the method of overall planning, phased breakthroughs, highlighting the center, and driving the general, and adopt the method of concentrating leaders, concentrating labor, concentrating tools, and concentrating materials and technical forces to rush to repair water conservancy facilities, and strive for early completion and early benefit. In order to better concentrate superior forces and set off a high tide of water conservancy construction, the province's water conservancy movement was roughly divided into two campaigns: the first campaign, from late October to mid-December last year, was a stage of concentrating main forces to storm small water conservancy projects. In less than a month, the task of building 800,000-odd small water conservancy projects was completed. After the decisive victory of small projects, in mid-December last year, all localities took advantage of the victory and turned to the second campaign, which was the stage of tackling key problems, mainly focusing on storming large and medium-sized projects. After the basic completion of small projects, most of the labor force turned to production items such as fertilizer accumulation, afforestation, wasteland reclamation, and winter crop management, and a part of the labor force turned to more than 150 large and medium-sized projects, and the project progress was greatly accelerated. In less than one and a half months after the start of the second campaign, more than 70 medium-sized projects were basically completed. At present, all localities, except for three large-scale projects, are striving to basically complete large and medium-sized projects in February.

We deeply realize that in a certain period, the leadership's determination to concentrate superior forces and storm to complete a major task is a good way to carry out production and construction at high speed. First of all, with the center of the movement highlighted, the leadership's energy concentrated, and the limited manpower, materials, and financial resources concentrated for use, greater effectiveness can be exerted, and the speed of water conservancy construction can be greatly accelerated. Secondly, only by storming to complete the water conservancy task can we free up our hands to vigorously grasp other winter production tasks and make various preparations for striving for a greater harvest of grain this year. Finally, and most importantly, only by concentrating superior forces in a certain period can we create a high tide of water conservancy construction. Practice has proved that only with a high tide can we better mobilize all positive factors of the whole party and the whole people, and mobilize all possible manpower, materials, and financial resources to invest in water conservancy construction; only with a high tide can the talents and wisdom of the masses be fully brought into play, and the masses can see their own great strength, dare to declare war on nature, and put forward magnificent plans for mountain and water management and construction.

Here, the key lies in the leadership's determination. When starting to formulate water conservancy plans last winter, many people worried that the plans were too large. As a result, the plans were not too large, but too small. The water conservancy construction planning indicators of many communes and counties have been broken through by the masses again and again. Taking the construction of reservoirs as an example, the original plan of the water conservancy department was to build 8,000 reservoirs throughout the province last winter and this spring, but after planning by party committees at all levels and discussion by the masses, it increased to 25,000 reservoirs, which is more than the total number of reservoirs built in the ten years since liberation. This plan was already active enough, but the province built 30,000 reservoirs, and overfulfilled the new plan by another 5,000 reservoirs.

The Commune is a New Foundation for Developing Water Conservancy

The third point we have a deep understanding of in the large-scale water conservancy construction last winter and this spring is that the "large-scale and public" people's commune has pushed the water conservancy construction movement to a new stage, and it is a new foundation for building water conservancy undertakings at high speed and on a large scale. With the people's commune, it is easy to hold larger backbone projects, so that large, medium, and small projects are combined; it is easy to combine the previously scattered and isolated projects to form a unified irrigation and drainage system; it is easy to carry out comprehensive planning and comprehensive management of small and medium-sized rivers; it is easy to uniformly allocate labor forces in a larger range according to the principle of equal value exchange, and organize large-scale collaboration and large-scale corps operations. These were not easy to do in the past. Last winter, Hengyang County divided the county into five irrigation areas according to river systems, connected more than 90,000 small and medium-sized projects into irrigation networks, carried out large-scale collaboration, and more than 200,000 people fought for a winter, and now they can basically eliminate waterlogging and drought disasters in the county; this was simply unimaginable in the past. They adopted the method of "building reservoirs upstream to irrigate downstream, and storing water in mountainous areas to irrigate plains," which solved the long-standing contradiction of uneven water source distribution between mountainous and plain areas. They also adopted the method of "multi-source convergence, long vines bearing melons, large reservoirs connecting small reservoirs, and small reservoirs connecting mountain ponds," drawing water over long distances to irrigate fields, implementing water conservancy to make up for deficiencies with surpluses, adjusting each other, and fully exploiting the role of large, medium, and small water conservancy projects. At the same time, combining water management with mountain and soil management, a large number of water source forests are built to control soil erosion, which is also conducive to the comprehensive development and utilization of water and soil resources. Such a comprehensive and great initiative to transform nature can only appear on the basis of the large-scale production of the people's commune.

Technological Innovation to Improve Efficiency

We also realize that carrying out a high-efficiency movement centered on technological innovation in water conservancy construction is also an important measure for building water conservancy projects at high speed. During the water conservancy upsurge, more than 7 million people were mobilized throughout the province every day. If each person can improve efficiency by one cubic meter per day, it is equivalent to adding 1.7 million laborers to the water conservancy front. Completing 7 million cubic meters of earth more in one day is equivalent to completing 500 small reservoirs. This is a way to build water conservancy projects in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. Therefore, the provincial party committee put forward the battle cry of "use less people, do more things, ask tools for labor, and ask technological innovation for time" when the water conservancy movement was launched. It requires all localities to adopt the method of combining leaders, masses, and technical personnel, widely mobilize the masses to boldly create and invent, and vigorously promote effective new tools. All localities have adopted the methods of adapting to local conditions, focusing on soil, combining indigenous and foreign methods, taking materials locally, and promoting them locally, and have promoted a total of more than 2.6 million new water conservancy construction tools. About 70% of the water conservancy construction sites in the province have basically realized mechanized soil construction, and labor efficiency has been continuously improved. The average efficiency of the province has increased from two cubic meters at the beginning of construction to three cubic meters, and then to four cubic meters, which has played a major role in winning the victory of the water conservancy movement.

Labor and Rest Should be Grasped at the Same Time

Finally, we realize that highly caring for the lives of the masses on the construction site is also the key to the healthy development of the high-efficiency water conservancy movement. Facts tell us that to lead the mass water conservancy movement well, we must first be good at closely combining the organization of mass production with the organization of mass life, and we must be good at skillfully combining the labor and rest of the masses. Secondly, leading cadres must go deep into the construction site and share weal and woe with the migrant workers. At the beginning of the movement, the provincial party committee put forward the requirements of ensuring health and ensuring safety, focusing on running the construction site canteen well, ensuring that migrant workers can eat hot dishes, hot meals, and hot soup, advocating growing vegetables and raising pigs on the construction site to improve the lives of migrant workers. Build good sheds to ensure that migrant workers have eight hours of sleep and rest. Also organized construction site consolation performances to enliven the construction site cultural and recreational life. At the same time, a large number of medical personnel were organized to go to the construction site to do a good job in construction site hygiene and pay attention to construction safety. Only in this way can the masses always maintain vigorous fighting spirit and soaring energy, and achieve high attendance rate, high efficiency, and good quality.

The vigorous development of the mass movement to build water conservancy in Hunan Province last winter and this spring, and the great achievements surpassing the total achievements of water conservancy construction in the past ten years, are a great victory for the Party's general line of building socialism, a victory for the Party's water conservancy policy, and a victory for greatly exploiting the superiority of the people's commune and launching mass movements.

From the winter of 1957 to the spring of 1958, a great upsurge of water conservancy construction once appeared in Hunan Province, and the water conservancy upsurge brought about a huge surge in agricultural production in 1958. The great water conservancy construction upsurge last winter and this spring will surely inspire the people of the province and promote a better and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production in 1960.

    移山千座　开河万里 
    中共湖南省委常委、湖南省副省长　章伯森
    伟大的人民公社，开辟了大生产的新局面，它在去冬今春湖南省水利建设上所显示的特点是：统一规划，流域治理，治山治水，全面开发，综合利用，美化山河。水利建设的规模由小到大，到大中小型相结合；范围由治水到治土，到治水治山治土并举，并做到了全面规划、综合治理、一水多用。这就使全省水利建设进入了一个新阶段。
    湖南省水利运动从去年10月下旬开始到去年年底止的两个月内，完成的土石方任务相当于解放十年来全省完成水利土石方总数的40％。两个月中全省修成八十多万处水利工程。全部工程修成后所增加蓄水量，为全省现有水利设施总蓄水量的90％。这对保证种双季稻用水的农田将由去年的一千四百万亩扩大到二千八百万亩，还可使一百万亩旱土变良田，一千四百万亩“天水田”变成自流灌溉；防洪能力也将有极大的提高。
    现在，各地正集中主要力量，争取在最短期间完成一百三十项大中型水利工程。去冬今春新建的大中型工程已超过解放十年来修建总数的一倍以上。很多县份在小型水库群中建立大中型主体工程，在主体水库外围建立辅助性的小型工程，用渠道把主体工程和辅助性工程联结成一个统一的排灌系统，做到塘库相连、长藤结瓜、万水归宗、综合利用，构成一幅改造自然、美化山河的雄伟图景。目前全省八百多条较大的河流，已有二百多条按流域规划进行了初步治理。
    大搞群众运动
    这样高速度的水利建设，在湖南水利建设史上，还是第一次出现的奇迹。
    我们首先体会到：以党的群众路线作为开展水利工作的指导思想，认真贯彻中央的治水方针，大搞群众运动，是高速度开展水利建设的关键。因为水利建设的范围广，数量大，只有充分发动群众，依靠群众，群策群力，才能解决大规模兴修水利中的人力、物力、资金技术等问题，才能解决上下游、左右岸、受益与非受益单位之间的矛盾，高速度地建设水利事业。实际情况也正是这样：去冬今春，全省水利建设中国家的投资虽只为解放十年来总数的13％，而修成的大小水利工程却比解放十年来兴建的总和多二十多万处；其中新建小型水库两万九千多座，比解放十年兴建水库总和还多60％；而且经过最近群众性的水利大检查大验收，已完工的水利工程有95％合乎工程质量标准，有80％以上的水库成套地完成，做到坝成渠通。
    只有赢得时间才能争取主动
    其次，领导上把握住当前的大好形势，鼓足干劲，力争上游，是去冬今春全省水利建设高速度发展的根本原因。去年8月间，全省各地认真贯彻党的八届八中全会精神，在反右倾、鼓干劲后，进一步坚持了政治挂帅，解放了人们的思想，全省广大农村出现了一个朝气蓬勃的大好形势。省委分析当时全省的政治形势是：正气上升、邪气下降，党的团结空前增强；经济形势是：生产高潮、崭新气象、经济繁荣，贸易兴旺，正是大搞农田基本建设的大好时机。
    运动一开始，省委就认为把握住当时水利运动大好形势的中心环节，是争取时间。只有赢得时间，提前完成计划，才有可能把水利战线上的大部分劳动力调度开来，投入积肥、造林、开荒等冬季生产工作。因此省委根据当时形势和历年修水利建设的经验，提出了“四早”（早准备、早开工、早完工、早受益），“四保”（保质量、保安全、保节约、保健康）的多快好省办水利的要求。去冬，全省水利建设开工一般较往年提早了一、两个月。要做到这一点，除早准备早开工外，还必须全面安排好劳动力，做到一定时期的中心突出。去年10月下旬，全省水利运动一开始，省委就明确地提出：以后两三个月的农村工作，以水利建设为中心。要求各地从本地的实际情况出发，分清任务的主次先后，采取全面规划、分段突击、中心突出、带动一般的办法，采取领导集中、劳力集中、工具集中、器材和技术力量集中的四集中的办法，突击抢修水利，力争早完工、早受益。为了更好地集中优势力量，掀起水利建设的高潮，全省水利运动又大体上分为两个战役进行：第一个战役从去年10月下旬到12月中旬，是集中主要力量突击小型水利工程的阶段。在不到一个月的时间内，突击完成了八十来万处小型水利工程的修建任务。在小型工程取得决定性的胜利之后，去年12月中旬，各地又乘胜转入第二个战役，即以突击大、中型工程为主的攻坚阶段。小型工程基本结束后，大部分劳动力转入积肥、造林、开荒、越冬作物管理等项生产，一部分劳力转入一百五十多项大、中型工程，工程进度大大加快。第二个战役开始不到一个半月，就有七十多处中型工程基本上突击完工。现在，各地大、中型工程中除三项大型工程外，都力争在2月份基本完成。
    我们深深地体会到：在一定时期，领导下决心，集中优势力量，突击完成一项主要任务，是高速度进行生产建设的好办法。首先，运动中心突出，领导精力集中，把有限的人力、物力、财力集中使用，就可以发挥更大的效力，就可以大大加快水利建设的速度。其次，突击完成水利任务，才有可能腾出手来，大抓其他各项冬季生产，为争取今年粮食更大丰收作好各方面的准备工作。最后，也是最重要的，只有一定时期集中优势力量，才能造成水利建设的高潮。实践证明：有了高潮，才能更好地调动全党全民的一切积极因素，动员一切可能动员的人力、物力、财力投入水利建设；有了高潮，群众的天才和智慧才能充分地发挥出来，群众才能亲眼看到自己的伟大力量，敢于向自然宣战，提出雄伟的治山治水的建设计划。
    在这里，关键在于领导的决心。去冬开始订水利规划时，许多人担心计划大了。结果计划不是大了，而是小了。许多公社和县里的水利建设规划指标，都一再被群众突破。就拿修建水库一项来说，原来水利部门规划全省去冬今春修建八千座水库，可是经过各级党委一规划，群众一讨论，便增加到二万五千座，比解放十年来修建水库总数还多。这个规划已经是够积极的了，但是全省却建成了三万座水库，又超额五千座完成了新的规划。
    公社是发展水利事业的新基础
    去冬今春大修水利中，我们体会较深的第三点是：“一大二公”的人民公社，把水利建设运动推向了一个新的阶段，它是高速度地大规模地建设水利事业的新基础。有了人民公社就便于举办较大的骨干工程，使大中小型工程结合起来；便于把过去分散孤立的工程联合起来，形成统一的排灌系统；便于对中小河流进行全面规划综合治理；便于按照等价交换的原则，在更大范围内统一调配劳动力，组织大协作和大兵团作战。这些在过去是不易办到的。去年冬天，衡阳县按河流水系把全县划为五个灌溉区，把九万多处中小型工程联成一个个的灌溉网，开展大协作，二十多万人奋战一冬，现在可以基本上消灭全县的水旱灾害；这在过去简直是无法想像的事情。他们采取“上游建库灌下游、山区蓄水灌平原”的办法，解决了长期以来无法解决的山区与平原地区水源分布不平衡的矛盾。他们还采取“多源汇集，长藤结瓜，大库联小库，小库联山塘”的办法，长距离引水灌田，在水利上实行以丰补歉，互相调剂，充分发挥了大中小型水利工程的作用。同时结合治水进行治山治土，大量营造水源林，控制水土流失，也有利于综合开发和利用水土资源。这样全面地改造自然的伟大创举，只有在人民公社大生产的基础上才可能出现。
    革新技术提高工效
    我们还体会到，在水利建设中开展以技术革新为中心的高工效运动，也是高速度建设水利工程的重要措施。我们在水利高潮时，全省每天出动七百多万人。如果每人每天能提高工效一公方，就等于水利战线上增加一百七十万名劳动力。一天多完成七百万方土，就等于完成五百座小型水库。这是多快好省建设水利的办法。因此，省委在水利运动展开时就提出：“少用人，多做事，向工具要劳力，向技术革新要时间”的战斗口号。要求各地采取领导、群众、技术人员三结合的办法，广泛地发动群众大胆创造发明，大力推广行之有效的新工具。各地采取因地制宜、以土为主、土洋结合、就地取材、就地推广的办法，推广了各种水利施工新工具共二百六十多万件，全省约有70％的水利工地基本上实现了土机械化施工，劳动工效不断提高。全省平均工效由开工时的两方提高到三方，再提到四方，对争取水利运动的胜利起了重大的作用。
    劳动与休息同时抓好
    最后，我们体会到：高度关心工地群众的生活，也是使水利高工效运动健康发展的关键。事实告诉我们：要领导好群众性的水利运动，首先必须善于把组织群众生产和组织群众生活密切结合起来，必须善于把群众的劳动与休息巧妙地结合起来。其次，领导干部必须深入工地与民工同甘共苦。运动一开始，省委就提出保健康、保安全的要求，着重办好工地食堂，保证民工能吃到热菜、热饭、热汤，提倡工地种菜、养猪，改善民工生活。搭好工棚，保证民工有八小时睡眠休息。还组织工地慰问演出，活跃工地文娱生活。同时组织大批医务人员下工地，搞好工地卫生工作，注意施工安全。这样才能使群众经常保持旺盛的斗志和冲天的干劲，做到出勤率高、工效高、质量好。
    湖南省去冬今春兴修水利的群众运动的蓬勃发展，并取得了超过过去十年修水利的总成就的巨大成绩，是党的建设社会主义总路线的伟大胜利，是党的水利方针的胜利，是大大发挥人民公社优越性大搞群众运动的胜利。
    1957年冬到1958年春湖南省曾经出现过兴修水利的大高潮，水利高潮带来了1958年农业生产的巨大高涨。去冬今春的巨大水利建设高潮，必将鼓舞全省人民，推动1960年农业生产更好更全面的跃进。
