Xinhua News Agency report:

    A vigorous spring vegetable production campaign has been enthusiastically launched in provinces and cities such as Guizhou, Zhejiang, Fujian, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Harbin.

    Early start, rapid progress, extensive planting, and good quality are the characteristics of this year's spring vegetable production in these provinces and cities. As of February 15th, Guizhou Province had overfulfilled its spring vegetable sowing plan by one-third, with the sown area nearly doubling compared to the same period last year. Cities and people's communes in Zhejiang Province have utilized all available idle land and have overfulfilled their sowing plans for late spring vegetables such as spinach, cabbage, mustard greens, and radishes. Fujian Province has not only vigorously expanded the area but also greatly increased the variety of vegetables; Fuzhou City alone has arranged for more than 250 varieties. Sichuan Province formed a high tide of spring vegetable production around the Spring Festival, and many areas have already overfulfilled the planting targets set by the provincial leadership. In the Wuhan area of Hubei Province, counties planted 1,070,000 mu of spring vegetables in the ten days from February 5th to 14th. Adding to the existing 1,300,000 mu of winter vegetables, the current average is more than 0.4 mu of vegetable land per person, an increase of more than 0.2 mu compared to the past. Under the slogan of "Plant more vegetables, plant them quickly, and plant them well," the Machang People's Commune in Shuyang County, Jiangsu Province, mobilized 2,000 laborers for a one-day blitz, planting various vegetables on "ten-edge" lands such as riverbanks, roadsides, and house sides. The area for planting vegetables in the suburbs of Beijing this year will be expanded by 40%, with special attention paid to the production of fine vegetables and increasing the variety. The sowing area of "four pungent" vegetables (green onions, ginger, garlic, and chili peppers), which used to rely on supplies from other places, will increase nearly threefold compared to last year. In the past ten days or so, the suburbs of Shanghai have planted 3,000 mu of leafy vegetables every day. At the same time, the large-scale eggplant and fruit seedlings have also begun the second transplanting before planting. On the basis of a bumper vegetable harvest last year, the people's communes in Harbin are advancing victoriously. In addition to fertilizing and watering more than 40,000 mu of vegetables planted last winter, they plan to further expand the area by 2.1 times this year.

    Party committees in various places have strengthened their leadership over spring vegetable production, and many areas have arranged for the sowing of spring vegetables as an important economic and political task. Some areas have also established special vegetable production offices and promoted advanced experiences in vegetable production through on-site meetings, training courses, and other methods to ensure a greater spring vegetable harvest.

    南北各地春菜生产运动热火朝天
    贵州、浙江、福建、四川、江苏北京、上海、武汉、哈尔滨大力扩大播种面积增加蔬菜品种
    据新华社消息　一个声势浩大的春菜生产运动，已在贵州、浙江、福建、四川、江苏、北京、上海、武汉和哈尔滨等省市热烈展开。
    动手早，进展快，播种多，质量好，是这些省市今年春菜生产的特点。贵州省到15日止，全省已超额三分之一完成了蔬菜春播计划，播种面积比去年同期扩大近两倍。浙江省各城市和人民公社，利用一切空隙闲地，已超额完成了菠菜、白菜、胶菜、萝卜等晚春蔬菜的播种计划。福建省各地不仅大力扩大面积，并且还大力增加品种，仅福州市安排的蔬菜就有二百五十多种。四川省在春节前后就形成了春菜生产高潮，许多地区已经超额完成了省领导机关提出的种植指标。湖北省武汉地区各县从2月5日到14日十天中，已种春菜一百零七万亩，加上原有的一百三十万亩冬菜，目前全区平均每人有四分多菜地，比过去增加了两分多地。江苏省沭阳县马厂公社在“多种菜、快种菜、种好菜”的口号下，出动两千名劳力，突击一天，就在河边、路边、屋边等“十边”土地上种满了各种蔬菜。北京市郊区今年播种蔬菜面积将扩大40％，并特别注意生产细菜，增加品种，过去要靠外地供应的“四辣”（葱、姜、蒜、辣椒）的播种面积要比去年增加将近三倍。最近十多天来，上海市郊每天种植叶菜达三千亩。同时，大面积用的茄果类秧苗，也开始作定植前的第二次移植。哈尔滨市各人民公社在去年蔬菜丰收的基础上乘胜前进，除对去冬种植的四万多亩蔬菜施肥浇水外，今年还计划再扩大面积二点一倍。
    各地党委都加强了对春菜生产的领导，许多地区都把播种春菜当作一项重要的经济和政治任务加以安排。有些地区还专门成立了蔬菜生产办公室，并通过召开现场会议、举办训练班等方式，推广蔬菜生产先进经验，保证春菜更大丰收。
