Desperately Creating a Hotbed of War in Asia
U.S. Imperialism Intensifies Arming of Japan

    This newspaper reports: Due to the signing of the new Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, Japan has become a breeding ground for the United States to create war in Asia.

    Establishing U.S. Military Bases Everywhere

    Akagi Munenori, Director-General of the Japanese "Defense Agency," revealed in the Diet on the 18th that there are currently 52,000 U.S. troops stationed in Japan. This includes 32,000 air force personnel, 15,000 navy personnel, and 5,000 army personnel.

    U.S. forces stationed in Japan are establishing military bases everywhere. Recently, the coastal area of Yamaguchi Prefecture facing the Sea of Japan, known as one of Japan's three major fishing grounds, will also be designated as a U.S. Air Force combat exercise area.

    "Akahata" pointed out on the 18th that the Kishi Nobusuke government's designation of the triangular sea area connecting Mishima and Tsushima Islands in northwestern Yamaguchi Prefecture and northern Kyushu as a U.S. Air Force exercise area will seriously threaten the livelihoods of fishermen in Yamaguchi Prefecture and Kyushu.

    Supporting Japan's Expansion of Armaments

    The United States is also stepping up its support for Japan to expand its armaments. According to a report in the "Yomiuri Shimbun" on the 16th, the U.S. Department of Defense recently notified the Japanese "Defense Agency" that it is willing to provide financial assistance for Japan's plans to research and develop new weapons, and requested the Japanese authorities to submit specific plans for researching and developing new weapons and the specific amount of research funds required.

    On the 13th, the United States provided Japan with a destroyer, increasing the total tonnage of the Japanese Navy's warships to 100,100 tons.

    This 2,350-ton destroyer, named "Akizuki," is equipped with various modern weapons and is currently the largest destroyer in Japan.

    Intensifying Japan's Nuclear Armament

    With the support of the United States, the Kishi Nobusuke government is stepping up its nuclear weapons equipment war activities. "Akahata"’s editorial on the 17th revealed that since August of last year, the Kishi Nobusuke government has dispatched seven "Self-Defense Force" officers to the United States to receive technical training in operating and transporting nuclear warheads and other nuclear weapons, along with military personnel from Turkey, West Germany, Canada, and the Netherlands. Domestically, the Kishi Nobusuke government is embarking on a plan to train a large number of atomic energy experts necessary for manufacturing atomic bombs, with the first phase of the plan scheduled to be completed by the end of next year. It also plans to build submarines capable of launching nuclear warheads by the end of 1962.

    According to the "Asahi Shimbun," the Kishi Nobusuke government is preparing to use 15 billion yen in the six-year arms expansion plan starting this year to establish five atomic divisions. This year, Japan will begin by equipping the "7th Composite Regiment" stationed in Hokkaido with 203mm howitzers capable of launching nuclear warheads.

    Controlling Japan's Armed Forces

    Of course, the United States is stepping up its armament of Japan in order to establish an aggression base in Asia for itself.

    According to the "Nihon Keizai Shimbun," the Kishi Nobusuke government is preparing to submit a resolution to the current Diet session to amend the "Defense Agency Establishment Law," with the aim of strengthening the authority of the Joint Staff Council, so that it can unify the command of the army, navy, and air force like the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, in order to facilitate joint operations with the U.S. military in the event of war. The newspaper said that the Japanese Air Force can accept the unified command of the U.S. Strategic Air Force in the region including Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea. When necessary, the Japanese army can also operate entirely under the command of the U.S. military.

    The United States is also doing its utmost to establish contact between Japan and the military groups under U.S. control as soon as possible. Recently, the United States "invited" Japan to participate in air force exercises involving member states of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and the Syngman Rhee clique. Because the Kishi Nobusuke government feared that participating in this exercise would provoke further attacks from opposition parties during the fierce debate in the Diet on the new "Security Treaty," it did not accept this "invitation." However, "Defense Agency" Director-General Akagi Munenori had to admit when answering questions in the Senate Budget Committee that the Kishi Nobusuke government would also participate in other military exercises of the U.S. aggressive bloc. Kishi Nobusuke also said, "In the future, Japan may also participate when the United States and Europe hold exercises."

    Aggressive Spearhead Aimed at China and the Soviet Union

    The aggressive spearhead of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries is aimed at the people of Asia, especially China and the Soviet Union. This can be clearly seen in Kishi Nobusuke's explanation of the scope of the Far East.

    The fact that U.S. and Japanese troops are expanding anti-Soviet bases in Hokkaido further proves this point.

    "Akahata" published an article on the 16th exposing that the Japanese government is stepping up the expansion of military bases in Wakkanai, the northern tip of Hokkaido, close to Soviet territory.

    The Wakkanai area is stationed with U.S. Air Force communications units and Japanese "Air Self-Defense Force" communications units. They use radar to conduct reconnaissance of Siberia and Sakhalin in the Soviet Union all day long. Since the Kishi Nobusuke government began specific negotiations with the United States on revising the "Security Treaty" in June of last year, it immediately accelerated the expansion of the Wakkanai base. In just six months, it spent more than 3 billion yen to establish many modern scientific facilities there.

    The "Asahi Shimbun" reported on the 16th that nearly one-third of the so-called Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" are deployed in Hokkaido. Tank regiments and artillery divisions equipped with rocket launchers are stationed here.

    This conspiracy by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries has aroused strong opposition from the people of the world and the people of Japan. The Japanese people have launched a large-scale struggle against the U.S.-Japan military treaty. They are determined to smash the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and lead Japan on the path of peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality.

### 竭力在亚洲制造战争策源地  美帝国主义加紧武装日本

    竭力在亚洲制造战争策源地
    美帝国主义加紧武装日本
    本报讯　由于新的日美军事同盟条约的签订，日本已经成为美国在亚洲制造战争的温床。
    到处建立美军基地
    日本“防卫厅”长官赤城宗德18日在国会中透露，驻在日本的美国军队现在有五万二千人。其中包括空军三万二千人，海军一万五千人，陆军五千人。
    驻日美军在日本到处建立军事基地。最近，号称日本三大渔场之一的面临日本海的山口县沿海也将被划为美国空军战斗演习区域。
    “赤旗报”在18日指出，岸信介政府把连结山口县北西部的见岛和对马岛以及北九州的三角形海域划为美国空军演习场，这将使山口县和九州的渔民的生活遭到严重的威胁。
    扶植日本扩充军备
    美国还加紧扶植日本扩充军备，据“读卖新闻”16日报道，美国国防部最近通知日本“防卫厅”，对于日本研究和发展新武器的计划表示愿意给予财政援助，并要求日本当局提出研究和发展新武器的具体方案和研究所需费用的具体数目。
    在13日美国已向日本提供了一艘驱逐舰，使日本海军舰艇的总吨数增加到十万零一千吨。
    这艘二千三百五十吨的驱逐舰名为“秋月”，装备着各种近代化武器，是日本现在最大的驱逐舰。
    加紧使日本核武装
    在美国的扶植下，岸信介政府正加紧核武装备战活动。“赤旗报”17日的社论揭露说，岸信介政府自从去年8月以后已经派遣了七名“自卫队”军官到美国去，同土耳其、西德、加拿大和荷兰的军事人员一起接受操纵、运送核弹头和其它核武器的技术训练。在国内，岸信介政府正在着手执行训练制造原子弹所必需的大批原子能专家的计划，第一阶段计划预定到明年底完成。它还计划到1962年底建造能发射核弹头的潜水艇。
    另据“朝日新闻”透露，岸信介政府准备在从今年起的六年扩军计划中，用一百五十亿日元成立五单位原子师。今年内，日本将先从驻扎在北海道的“第七混成团”开始装备能发射核弹头的二百零三毫米口径的榴弹炮。
    控制日本武装力量
    当然，美国加紧武装日本，是为了使自己在亚洲建立一个侵略基地。
    据“日本经济新闻”透露，岸信介政府准备向这次国会会议提出修改“防卫厅设置法”的决议案，其目的是为了加强幕僚长联席会议的权限，使它像美国参谋长联席会议那样可以统一指挥陆海空三军，以便于在发生战争时同美军共同作战。报纸说，日本的空军可以在包括日本、台湾、南朝鲜这个区域内接受美国战略空军的统一指挥。必要时，日本军队还可以全面在美军指挥下作战。
    美国还竭力使日本早日和美国控制下的军事集团建立联系。最近，美国就“邀请”日本参加东南亚侵略集团的成员国和蒋介石集团和李承晚集团的空军演习。岸信介政府由于怕参加这次演习会在国会关于新“安全条约”的激烈辩论中，招致各反对党的进一步攻击，没有接受这个“邀请”。但是，“防卫厅”长官赤城宗德在参议院预算委员会答复质询时不得不承认，岸信介政府还将参加美国侵略集团的其他军事演习。岸信介也说，“将来美国和欧洲举行演习时，日本也有可能参加。”
    侵略矛头针对中苏
    美日反动派的侵略矛头，是针对亚洲人民，特别是针对中国和苏联的。这一点，在岸信介关于远东范围的解释中，已经可以看得很明白了。
    美日军队在北海道扩建反苏基地的事实，更进一步证明这一点。
    “赤旗报”16日发表文章揭露，日本政府在靠近苏联领土的北海道北端——稚内加紧扩建军事基地。
    稚内地区驻有美国空军通讯部队和日本“航空自卫队”通讯部队。它们整天用雷达向苏联的西伯利亚和库页岛进行侦察。自从去年6月岸信介政府同美国就修改“安全条约”问题开始具体谈判以来，立即加快了稚内基地的扩建工作。仅仅在半年内就用三十多亿日元在那里建立了许多近代科学设施。
    “朝日新闻”在16日报道说，所谓日本“自卫队”几乎有三分之一的兵力配置在北海道。这里驻扎有坦克团、配备着火箭装置的炮兵师。
    美日反动派这种阴谋已经引起世界人民和日本人民的强烈反对。日本人民已经掀起了大规模的反对日美军事条约的斗争。他们决心要粉碎日美反动派的阴谋，使日本走上和平、独立、民主、中立的道路。
