    The Speed of Shashi
    Jing Yu
    In the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution in Shashi, Hubei, workers created 501 types of indigenous and foreign mechanical equipment in one and a half months. This enabled the widespread mechanization and semi-mechanization of heavy manual labor and manual operations. Work efficiency increased from one to forty times, saving more than 4,000 workers. This matter is worth pondering.
    One and a half months is only a fleeting moment in the 1960s, just a short period in a year's work. Seedlings planted one and a half months ago will only adapt to the new environment one and a half months later. Rice planted one and a half months ago will only grow into tender seedlings after one and a half months. However, the technical innovation in Shashi in one and a half months has allowed heavy manual labor to be widely replaced by mechanized and semi-mechanized tools. Such rapid change demonstrates the great significance of technical innovation and technical revolution. It also shows that mechanization is not mysterious, and the transition from manual production to mechanical production does not require a long time. As long as the broad masses are truly involved in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the difficulties of mechanization can be overcome, and the process of mechanization can be shortened. If a medium-sized city with a very weak technical foundation can achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization in one and a half months, can't all cities with the same or better technical foundation catch up with or surpass it?
    High speed is the soul of the general line for socialist construction. How to achieve high speed? "Walking on two legs" is high speed. Taking mechanization as an example, on the one hand, the state needs to develop the machinery industry in a planned and step-by-step manner, and gradually equip our industry and agriculture with machinery. On the other hand, various localities adopt the method of self-reliance to manufacture various machines, indigenous machines, foreign machines, and a combination of indigenous and foreign machines, to equip themselves. This is "walking on two legs," which makes it possible to achieve high speed. Our country is very large, and there are many places that need machinery, and many types of work that need mechanization. Foundry workers need mechanization, and fitters also need mechanization. The packaging in the light industry industry needs mechanization, as well as the short-distance transportation of products in production, cutting and blanking, and powder mixing. Basic construction, loading and unloading transportation need mechanization in even more places. Can all of this be covered by the state? Of course not. Waiting for the state to allocate everything would not be high speed, but only low speed. Therefore, from the perspective of each locality, isn't it of greater significance to raise self-reliance to the level of high speed?
    The development of technical innovation and technical revolution is an important factor in the high-speed development of social productive forces. However, the speed of technical revolution also depends on ideological revolution. Whether to rely on others ideologically or to be self-reliant; whether to be constrained or to dare to think and dare to do; whether to doubt new things or to support new things? These directly affect the speed of the technical revolution. Once advanced revolutionary ideas are grasped by the working masses, they will immediately become a huge material force; while backward and conservative ideas shrouding people's minds will become an obstacle to production development. An important experience in Shashi's achievement of mechanization and semi-mechanization in one and a half months is to raise the technical revolution to the height of the ideological revolution as a guiding ideology. They launched a high tide of studying Mao Zedong Thought throughout the city. They organized more than 1,800 study groups to study Mao Zedong's works to realize the slogan "Technical revolution must be driven by ideological revolution." When Mao Zedong Thought was grasped by the masses, it became a great material force for developing the technical revolution. It can be seen how great an impact the superstructure and ideological aspects have on the development of the foundation!
    In the era of the Great Leap Forward, many new things are happening and developing in our country from the countryside to the city, and from the city to the countryside, every moment. Shashi, as a medium-sized city, achieving mechanization in one and a half months is just one of many new things. We enthusiastically introduce it because it can greatly broaden our knowledge, greatly increase our courage, and stride forward!

    沙市的速度
    静宇
    湖北沙市职工在大闹技术革新和技术革命的群众运动中，一个半月创造了土、洋机械设备五百零一种，使笨重的体力劳动和手工操作普遍实现机械化半机械化，工效提高一倍至四十倍，劳动力节省四千多人。这件事情值得发人深思。
    一个半月，在六十年代仅是短暂的一瞬，在一年的工作中只是一个很短的时间。一个半月以前栽下的树苗，一个半月以后才能适应新的水土；一个半月以前种下的稻谷，一个半月以后也仅仅长出了幼嫩的秧苗，而沙市的一个半月技术革新，却使手工为主的笨重劳动普遍以机械化半机械化工具来代替。变化如此之快，正表明了技术革新和技术革命运动的伟大意义。并且也表明了机械化并不神秘，手工生产变为机械生产也不需要很长的时间。只要广大群众真正投入了技术革新和技术革命运动，机械化的难关是可以攻破的，机械化的过程也是可以缩短的。一个技术基础非常薄弱的中等城市，能够在一个半月实现机械化半机械化，一切技术基础相同的或较好的城市，不是也可以赶上或赶过它吗？
    高速度是社会主义建设总路线的灵魂。怎样才能高速度？“两条腿走路”就是高速度。拿机械化问题来说，一方面国家需要有计划有步骤地发展机械工业，逐步把我们的工业、农业用机械装备起来；另一方面，各个地方采取自力更生的办法，制造各种机械，土机械、洋机械、土洋结合的机械，来装备自己，这就是“两条腿走路”，这就有可能达到高速度。我们的国家很大，需要机械的地方很多，需要机械化的工种很多，铸工要机械化，钳工也要机械化；轻工业行业中的包装需要机械化，在制品的短途运输、剪裁下料、配粉搅拌也需要机械化；基本建设、装卸运输需要机械化的地方更多。能不能全部由国家包下来呢？当然不能。一切等待国家来分配，那就不是什么高速度，而只能是低速度了。因此，从每个地方来说，把自力更生提高到高速度来认识，难道不是更有重大意义吗？
    技术革新和技术革命的发展是高速度发展社会生产力的重要因素。然而，技术革命进展的快慢，还取决于思想革命。思想上是依赖别人，还是自力更生；是束手束脚，还是敢想敢干；是怀疑新生事物，还是支持新生事物？这都直接影响着技术革命的快慢。先进的革命思想一旦为工人群众所掌握，立刻就会变成巨大的物质力量；而落后的保守的思想笼罩着人们的头脑，就成为生产发展的障碍。沙市在一个半月实现机械化半机械化，其中一条重要经验，就是把技术革命提高到思想革命的高度作为指导思想，在全市掀起了学习毛泽东思想的高潮，他们组织了一千八百多个学习小组学习毛泽东著作，以实现“技术革命要以思想革命为动力”的口号。当毛泽东思想掌握了群众的时候，就成了发展技术革命的伟大的物质力量。可见上层建筑意识形态方面的东西对于基础的发展是有着多么大的影响！
    在大跃进的时代，我们的国家从乡村到城市，从城市到乡村，每时每刻都有许多新的事物发生和发展。沙市作为一个中等城市在一个半月实现机械化，只是许多新事物中的一个。我们热情地介绍它，因为它可以使我们大长见识，大壮胆量，阔步向前！
