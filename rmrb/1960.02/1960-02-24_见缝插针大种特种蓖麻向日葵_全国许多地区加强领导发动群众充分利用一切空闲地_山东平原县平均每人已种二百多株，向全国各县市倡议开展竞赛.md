Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd. In developing oil production this year, many regions across the country, in addition to promoting the planting of oil crops by people's communes and state-owned farms, have also mobilized the masses to make full use of all available idle land to widely plant castor, sunflower, and other oil crops. Shandong Province recently convened a meeting of heads of grain bureaus from various counties to make comprehensive plans for using idle land to plant oil crops. By February 16th, six regions in the province, including Liaocheng and Zibo, had planted nearly 1.2 billion plants of castor, sunflower, etc. Pingyuan County, which has consistently excelled in oil crop planting, mobilized more than 300,000 people during the Spring Festival to focus on planting castor seeds. By the 9th of this month, the county had planted over 179.9 million plants, a tenfold increase compared to last year. Qinyuan County in Shanxi Province, led by more than 20,000 young people, is making extensive use of barren mountains, corners of land, forest areas, and canals to plant castor and sunflower. Currently, the county has cultivated and reclaimed over 47,000 mu of barren mountainous land and planted over 14,000 mu. In order to vigorously develop oil production, Yucheng County in Henan Province organized 211 shock teams which, after three days and nights of intense effort, planted over 668,000 castor plants. Employees of the grain departments in Zhangpu County, Fujian Province, actively responded to the county party committee's call, with everyone taking action to plant castor. As of early February, they had planted over 327,000 castor plants.

In order to conduct the mass movement of planting oil crops in a planned and led manner, many regions are formulating plans at all levels and undertaking a series of preparatory tasks based on their local conditions. Jiangsu Province has decided to launch a mass movement throughout the province to plant one hundred oil plants per person, and has called on the people of the province to ensure that each person has three to five walnut trees within the next three to five years. To strengthen leadership in this work, the Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee has also established a "Walnut Grafting Office." Beijing recently conducted a survey of idle land in the city. According to preliminary estimates, if half of the land along the main roads and major river canals in the city could be utilized, over 160 million castor and sunflower plants could be planted, increasing oil production by over 15 million jin. The city has already held a large-scale exhibition on the comprehensive utilization of castor and sunflower to carry out publicity and education among the people of the city. The Heilongjiang Provincial Grain Department and Agricultural Department recently jointly held an oil production technology training class to strengthen technical guidance on oil production.

When widely and deeply mobilizing the masses to use idle land to plant oil crops, all regions have conscientiously implemented the policy that the benefits of collective planting belong to the collective, and the benefits of individual planting belong to the individual. Hebei, Shandong, and other places have also stipulated some reward measures for the masses who sell oil produced from idle land. Grain and commercial departments in various places have also seriously made comprehensive arrangements for the seeds needed for expanding the planting of castor, sunflower, etc.

Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd. Pingyuan County, Shandong Province, which has achieved remarkable results in mobilizing the masses to plant oil crops since 1959, recently issued a proposal to all counties and cities across the country to carry out a competition in using idle land to produce oil.

The proposal stated that on the basis of the bumper harvest in 1959, in order to seize an even greater harvest of oil crops in 1960, we launched a mass movement to plant castor, sunflower, and other oil crops during the Spring Festival. By February 9th, the county had planted a total of 179,908,000 castor and sunflower plants. Calculated based on the county's population, this averages 219 plants per person, exceeding the original plan of 200 plants per person, and is estimated to increase the country's oil production by 22.5 million jin. In order to continue to advance victoriously on the road of the Great Leap Forward, we now propose the goal of ensuring that the county averages 250 oil plants per person in 1960, and striving for 300 plants, and to launch a friendly competition with brother counties and cities across the country. Our measures are:

	1. Adhere to putting politics in command, and vigorously launch mass movements. Deeply implement the policy that the benefits of collective planting belong to the collective, and the benefits of individual planting belong to the individual. Resolve ideological problems at all levels, mobilize the enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and the masses, and ensure that everyone from towns to villages participates in the movement to plant oil crops.

	2. Carry out red flag competitions of "compare, learn, catch up, help" between communes, teams, and individuals. The content of the competition is "five guarantees and two comparisons," namely: guarantee planting, guarantee survival, guarantee management, guarantee harvest, and guarantee sales to the state; compare quantity and compare quality.

	3. Secretaries take the lead at all levels, all cadres participate, dividing areas and sections, assigning people to be responsible, conducting regular inspections and evaluations, and carrying out competition between counterparts to ensure that no land is left idle and every seedling is valued.

	4. Plant extensively and diversely, and strengthen management. On the basis of planting sufficiently and well, strengthen management and increase yield per unit area. After emergence, first check and replant seedlings to ensure that all seedlings are complete and vigorous; second, water, fertilize, and cultivate the soil in a timely manner, ensuring that each plant receives 1 qian of fertilizer and 10 jin of water, to ensure that the plants are large, have many branches, the seeds are full, and every grain is stored in the granary and sold to the state to support socialist construction.

    见缝插针大种特种蓖麻向日葵
    全国许多地区加强领导发动群众充分利用一切空闲地
    山东平原县平均每人已种二百多株，向全国各县市倡议开展竞赛
    新华社23日讯　全国许多地区在今年在发展油料生产中，除了促进人民公社、国营农场种植油料作物以外，还发动广大群众利用一切可以利用的空闲地，广泛种植蓖麻、葵花和其他油料作物。山东省最近召开了各县粮食局长会议，对利用空闲地种植油料作了全面规划。到2月16日，这个省的聊城、淄博等六个地区已种植蓖麻、葵花等近十二亿株。油料种植工作一贯出色的平原县，在春节期间动员了三十多万人突击种植蓖麻籽，到本月9日止，全县已种植一亿七千九百多万株，比去年增加了十倍。山西省沁源县以两万多名青少年为主力，利用荒山、地角、林间、渠道，大种蓖麻和向日葵。目前全县已耕、翻荒山地四万七千多亩，种植了一万四千多亩。河南虞城县为了大搞油料生产，组织了二百十一个突击队，经过三昼夜的突击，种植蓖麻六十六万八千多株。福建省漳浦县粮食部门职工积极响应县委号召，人人动手，大种蓖麻，截至2月上旬，已种蓖麻三十二万七千多株。
    为了使种植油料作物的群众运动有计划、有领导地进行，许多地区根据本地的情况，正在层层制订规划和展开一系列准备工作。江苏省决定在全省范围内，开展一个每人百株油料的群众运动，并号召全省人民在最近三、五年内，做到每人有三至五株核桃树。为加强这一工作的领导，江苏省人民委员会还成立了“核桃嫁接办公室”。北京市最近对全市空闲地进行了调查，据初步估算全市主要公路、河流干渠的两旁，如果能利用一半，就可以种蓖麻、葵花一亿六千多万株，可以增产油脂一千五百多万斤。这个市已经举办了蓖麻、葵花综合利用的大型展览会，向全市人民展开宣传教育。黑龙江省粮食厅和农业厅最近联合举办了油料生产技术训练班，以加强油料对生产的技术指导。
    各地在广泛深入地发动群众利用空闲地种植油料时，都认真贯彻了集体种植收益归集体，个人种植收益归个人的政策。河北、山东等地对于群众出售利用空闲地种的油料，还规定了一些奖励办法。各地粮食、商业部门对于扩种蓖麻、葵花等所需的种籽，也认真进行了全面安排。
    新华社23日讯　1959年以来发动群众种植油料作物有显著成绩的山东省平原县，最近向全国各县市提出了开展利用空闲地种植油料生产竞赛的倡议书。
    倡议书说，在1959年大丰收的基础上，为了夺取1960年油料作物的更大丰收，我们在春节期间，掀起了一个群众性的种植蓖麻、葵花、油料运动，到2月9日，全县已种植蓖麻、葵花共一万七千九百零八万株，按全县人口计算，平均每人种二百一十九株，超额完成原定每人二百株的计划，约可为国家增产油脂二千二百五十万斤。为了在跃进的道路上，继续乘胜前进，我们现在提出1960年全县平均每人保证种植油料二百五十株，争取三百株的奋斗目标，与全国各兄弟县市展开友谊竞赛。我们的措施是：
    一、坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。深入贯彻集体种植的收益归集体所有，个人种植的收益归个人的政策，层层解决思想问题，调动广大干部和群众的积极性，从城镇到农村，人人参加种植油料作物运动。
    二、开展社与社、队与队、人与人之间的比、学、赶、帮的红旗竞赛。竞赛内容是“五保、二比”，即保种、保活、保管、保收、保出售给国家；比数量、比质量。
    三、书记层层带头，全体干部参加，分片划段，定人包干，定期检查评比，开展对手对口竞赛，做到寸田不闲、棵苗必争。
    四、大种多种，加强管理。在种足种好的基础上，加强管理，提高单位面积产量。在出苗后，首先要检查补苗，保证苗全齐旺；其次要适时浇水追肥、培土，做到每株一铣肥、十斤水，确保棵大、枝多，籽粒饱满、粒粒归仓，并且要卖给国家支援社会主义建设。（附图片）
