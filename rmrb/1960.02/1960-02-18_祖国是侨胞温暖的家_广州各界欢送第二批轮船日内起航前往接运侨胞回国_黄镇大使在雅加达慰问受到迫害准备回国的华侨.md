Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 17th—The second batch of ships sent by our government to Indonesia to bring back overseas Chinese are currently raising their fires in Huangpu Port, ready to depart for Indonesia in the coming days to bring overseas Chinese back home. Over 1,200 people from Guangzhou, including returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, returned overseas Chinese students, and people from all walks of life, held a grand meeting in Huangpu Port today to warmly see off the staff members departing with the ships and all the crew members of these two Soviet passenger ships.

The masses warmly cheered when the staff members accompanying the ships and the captains and crew members of the passenger ships "Russia" and "Yakutia" came to participate in the meeting. The returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students from Guangzhou who attended the meeting were overjoyed because their relatives were about to return to the motherland. The students even sang songs such as "Orphans Overseas Have a Mother Now" and "The Motherland is the Only Warm Home."

Zhong Qingfa, Director of the General Office of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, spoke at the meeting on behalf of the Reception and Settlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. He expressed a warm welcome to the overseas Chinese in Indonesia who have been persecuted and are unwilling to continue living there, to return and participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. He said that the motherland will do its best to help them solve their difficulties and arrange their lives and work. Liu Tianfu, Vice Governor of Guangdong Province, also spoke at the meeting, expressing a warm welcome on behalf of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee to the overseas Chinese who are about to return. He said that in order to do a good job in settlement and reception, Guangdong Province has established a Reception and Settlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese and is actively carrying out preparations in various aspects. Currently, various ports in Guangdong are planning to add relevant facilities, and the transportation tools and various materials needed for the reception work are being prepared. State-owned overseas Chinese farms and some state-owned farms have made the necessary preparations for settling returned overseas Chinese. People's communes in various places are also prepared to warmly welcome overseas Chinese back to their hometowns. Industrial and mining enterprises will also arrange suitable jobs for the workers among the returned overseas Chinese. The overseas Chinese who return to the motherland will be properly arranged in terms of both work and life.

In their speeches, Zhong Qingfa and Liu Tianfu expressed the hope that the staff members accompanying the ships will overcome difficulties and successfully complete the tasks assigned by the motherland. Ma Dengjie, the representative of the staff members accompanying the ships, also stated at the meeting that they must live up to the expectations of the motherland and the people and ensure the successful completion of the task.

After the meeting, the welcoming crowd, carrying colorful flags, dancing lions, beating gongs and drums, and setting off firecrackers, accompanied all the staff members and crew members accompanying the ships to the dock.

In preparation for receiving this group of returning overseas Chinese, relevant departments have already transferred about one hundred tons of materials, including grain, non-staple food, underwear, single clothing, cotton clothing, medicine, records, films, and children's toys for men, women, and children, to meet the needs of the overseas Chinese on board.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 16th—Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia Huang Zhen and his wife, as well as Cultural Counselor of the Embassy Sima Wensen, today comforted overseas Chinese from Cirebon who had been subjected to discrimination and persecution. They arrived in Jakarta yesterday to await ships sent by the motherland to take them back home.

Ambassador Huang Zhen and Counselor Sima Wensen had cordial conversations with these overseas Chinese and conveyed the deep concern of the motherland's government and people for them. Ambassador Huang Zhen told them that the motherland welcomes them back and has made appropriate arrangements for them. Ambassador Huang Zhen's concern for these overseas Chinese who have been deprived of their livelihoods deeply moved them. They all hoped that the Indonesian government would allow them to return to the motherland as soon as possible. An overseas Chinese originally from Meixian County, Guangdong Province, who had not returned to his hometown for more than 30 years, told Ambassador Huang Zhen that he was willing to go to Hainan Island to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. Ambassador Huang Zhen praised his aspirations and said that the motherland would arrange work for them according to their wishes.

Chinese Consul General in Jakarta Li Jusheng held a film reception last night for the first group of overseas Chinese from West Java who came to await ships to return home. These overseas Chinese were warmly received and comforted by the staff of the Consulate General. The overseas Chinese watched the colorful films "Celebrating Ten Years" and "Young People in Our Village" from the motherland with great interest. When Chairman Mao appeared on the screen, they excitedly applauded enthusiastically and for a long time. When they saw various scenes of the great achievements of the motherland's socialist construction appearing on the screen, they also repeatedly applauded. These overseas Chinese, who lived in the countryside and rarely had the opportunity to see films from the motherland, were particularly delighted to see the thriving appearance of the motherland on the screen. They deeply felt that their future after returning to the motherland was very bright.
