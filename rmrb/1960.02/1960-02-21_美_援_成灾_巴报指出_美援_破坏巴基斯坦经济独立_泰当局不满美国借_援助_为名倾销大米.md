Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report: According to Xinhua News Agency dispatches: The "Karachi Times" recently said in a commentary on "US Aid": "We cannot rely too much on foreign aid." "It is common knowledge that economic aid programs cannot balance the economies of backward countries." The newspaper also said that most of the "aid" is "consumed by foreign staff stationed in these countries, and the regular interest payments on development loans also consume a large amount of funds."

　　The "Pakistan Times" recently pointed out in an article on US "aid" to Pakistan in the past ten years that because the United States has placed Pakistan in a position to supply raw materials and serve as a market for Western goods, Pakistan's dependence on imports has now reached an unprecedented level. It accused the United States of consistently trying to prevent Pakistan from achieving industrialization.

　　The newspaper said that there are thousands of American advisors, consultants, experts, cultural officials, missionaries, educators and engineers in Pakistan, and Pakistan usually accepts their opinions. American advisors participate in planning work at almost all levels in Pakistan. Therefore, the United States should bear a great responsibility for Pakistan's current economic situation.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok: According to Thai newspapers, the Thai Cabinet recently decided to authorize the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Economic Affairs to hold negotiations with the US government on the issue of US dumping of rice in Asia.

　　The Thai Cabinet made this decision after hearing reports from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Economic Affairs regarding the US preparations to dump rice in Asia. According to reports, the Thai Cabinet believes that the US practice of dumping rice in Asian countries under the guise of "aid" will inevitably affect Thailand's rice exports and cause losses to Thailand.

　　The General Manager of the Thai Rice Industry Company, Nai Ma, said to the press that whether the United States dumps rice in Asian countries in the form of "aid" or directly, its purpose is to compete for the rice market and will affect Thailand's rice exports.

    美“援”成灾
    巴报指出“美援”破坏巴基斯坦经济独立
    泰当局不满美国借“援助”为名倾销大米
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：“卡拉奇时报”最近在一篇评论里谈到“美援”时说：“我们不能过多的依靠外援。”“经济援助计划不能平衡落后国家的经济，这是普通常识。”报纸又说，大部分“援助”都“消耗在驻在这些国家的外国工作人员身上，支付开发贷款的定期利息也消耗了一大笔基金”。
    “巴基斯坦时报”最近在一篇文章中谈到美国过去十年中对巴基斯坦的“援助”时指出，由于美国使巴基斯坦处于供给原料和作为西方推销商品的市场的地位，现在巴基斯坦依赖进口的情况已经到了前所未有的地步。它指责美国一直企图不让巴基斯坦实现工业化。
    这家报纸说，在巴基斯坦有数以千计的美国顾问、谘询人员、专家、文化官员、传教士、教育家和工程师，巴基斯坦通常总是接受他们的意见。美国的顾问几乎参加了巴基斯坦各级的计划工作。所以说，美国应当对巴基斯坦目前的经济情况负很大责任。
    据新华社讯　曼谷消息：据泰国报纸报道，泰国内阁最近决定授权外交部和经济部就美国在亚洲倾销大米这件事同美国政府举行谈判。
    泰国内阁是在听取了外交部和经济部所做的关于美国准备在亚洲倾销大米的报告以后做出这个决定的。据报道，泰国内阁认为，美国在“援助”的名义下向亚洲国家倾销大米的做法，必将影响到泰国大米的输出，使泰国蒙受损失。
    泰国米业公司总经理乃玛向报界发表谈话指出，不论美国是在“援助”的形式下，还是直接向亚洲国家倾销大米，它的目的都是为争夺大米市场，都会影响泰国大米的输出。
