Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, February 17th: A joint communique between the Soviet Union and India was issued in Delhi on the 16th.

The communique stated that during Khrushchev's visit to India, he met and held talks with the Indian President, Vice President, Prime Minister, and other Indian government officials. In his friendly and sincere talks with the Prime Minister, many issues concerning international relations and specific issues of mutual interest to both countries were touched upon.

The communique said, "The two Prime Ministers noted with great satisfaction the favorable changes that have recently occurred in international relations, which have led to a significant relaxation of international tension. This relaxation is due in no small measure to the direct initiatives and joint efforts of the leaders of the major powers, particularly Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev and US President Eisenhower. The direct contact established between them, and constantly strengthened by reciprocal visits, is a valuable factor in promoting international mutual understanding and has contributed to reaching the welcome agreement to hold a summit meeting of the leaders of the four countries—the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France—in May of this year. All peace-loving people place their hopes on such meetings. People eagerly anticipate the complete success of the efforts of the leaders of the major powers. The Indian side gladly expresses its sincerity and offers its moral support for such constant and sustained efforts for peace."

The communique continued, "The Indian Prime Minister reiterated his high appreciation of Khrushchev's proposal for comprehensive disarmament." "The two Prime Ministers reaffirmed their position on the prohibition of thermonuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. They also expressed the hope that the major powers can take the first step, in the spirit of and based on the proposal that India had the honor of presenting at the recent UN General Assembly, namely, to cease testing nuclear weapons. Not only nuclear weapons but also conventional armaments are serious obstacles on the road to human progress."

The communique said, "During his talks with Prime Minister Nehru and other Indian state activists, Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev gave a high evaluation of India's policy of neutrality and non-alignment in military alliances. He emphasized that this policy is deeply respected in the Soviet Union."

Regarding the relations between India and the Soviet Union, the communique stated, "Their relations have never been based on a more solid foundation of friendship and understanding than they are now. Their shared commitment to peaceful coexistence and their common determination to promote the cause of lasting peace have brought the two countries closer and greatly expanded the scope of their effective cooperation within the United Nations and abroad." The communique said, "The two Prime Ministers are pleased to note that the economic and cultural relations between the two countries are equally close."

    公报说，“两国总理极其满意地指出，近来在国际关系中发生了有利的变化，这种变化导致国际紧张局势大大缓和。这种缓和的产生在不小的程度上是由于大国领导人、特别是苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和美国总统艾森豪威尔的直接倡议和共同努力所致。他们之间建立的、并且由于互相访问而不断加强的直接接触在增进国际互相谅解方面是一个有价值的因素，并且促进了达成受到大家欢迎的、在今年5月举行苏、美、英、法四国国家领导人最高级会晤的协议。一切爱好和平的人都对这类会晤寄予希望。人们殷殷瞩望大国领导人的努力获得完全成功。印度方面欣然表示自己的诚意，表示在道义上支持为和平而作的这种经常的持久努力。”
    公报接着说，“印度总理再度表示对赫鲁晓夫的全面裁军建议的高度评价。”“两国总理重申自己在禁止热核武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器方面的立场。他们还表示希望大国能按照印度荣幸地在最近一次联大上提出的提案的精神并在这项提案的基础上采取第一步，即停止试验核武器。不仅核武器，而且常规军备都是人类进步道路上的严重障碍。”
    公报说，“苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在同尼赫鲁总理和印度其他国家活动家的会谈中，对于印度奉行中立和不参加军事同盟的政策给予很高的评价。他强调指出，这个政策在苏联受到深深的尊敬。”
    公报谈到印度和苏联的关系的时候说，“它们的关系过去从来没有建立在比现在更为巩固的友好和谅解的基础上。它们对和平共处的共同信守和促进建立持久和平事业的共同决心使两国接近了，并且大大扩大了它们在联合国内外进行有效合作的范围。”公报说，“两国总理高兴地指出，两国在经济和文化方面的关系是同样密切的。”
