    How to Identify Different Wheat Rust Diseases?
    After wheat gets rust disease, bright yellow or reddish-brown powdery pustules appear on the leaves or stems. There are three types of wheat rust, which are easily identified due to the different colors, shapes, and affected areas of their lesions.
    The lesions of wheat stripe rust are bright yellow, very small, and arranged in rows. The epidermis around the lesions does not lift up, and it mainly occurs on the leaves, but can also occur on leaf sheaths, stems, and ears.
    The lesions of wheat leaf rust are orange-yellow or orange-red, round, very small, and scattered irregularly on the leaf surface. The epidermis around the lesions does not lift up. It mainly occurs on the leaves, but can also occur on leaf sheaths.
    The lesions of wheat stem rust are brown-red, oval, relatively large, and occur irregularly. The epidermis around the lesions is obviously torn and lifted up. It mainly occurs on the stems, but can also occur on leaves, leaf sheaths, and ears.

    怎样识别不同的小麦锈病？
    小麦生了锈病以后，叶子上或秆子上长出鲜黄色或红褐色的粉疤状病斑。小麦锈病有三种，由于它们病斑的颜色、形状及为害部位不同，很容易识别。
    小麦条锈病的病斑呈鲜黄色，很小，排列成行，病斑四周表皮不翻起，多发生在叶片上，叶鞘、秆、穗上也有发生。
    小麦叶锈病的病斑呈桔黄色、桔红色，圆形，病斑很小，不规则散生在叶面上，病斑四周表皮不翻起。主要发生在叶片上，叶鞘上也有发生。
    小麦秆锈病的病斑呈棕红色，椭圆形，病斑较大，不规则发生，病斑表皮四周明显撕裂翻起，多发生在秆上，叶片、叶鞘和穗上也有发生。
