    Under the guise of "cooperation," Japan is in fact expanding its influence.
    The total value of overseas projects undertaken by Japan will reach 30 billion yen.
    (Report from this newspaper) According to Japan's "Mainichi Shimbun," in order to vigorously expand into Southeast Asia, the Kishi Nobusuke government's Ministry of Construction newly established an "Overseas Cooperation Section" in 1959. The task of this agency is mainly to provide construction technology and building materials to various parts of Southeast Asia, in order to pave the way for the penetration of Japanese monopoly capital. It is estimated that the total value of projects that Japan can undertake will reach 30 billion yen.
    In the Philippines, the main project is the Mariquina Dam, which is being built by Japan as war reparations. This project is expected to be completed in five years, with a total project cost of 54 million US dollars, of which Japan will bear 35 million US dollars. Due to Japan's involvement in this large dam project, Japanese monopoly capital not only gains huge benefits in terms of technical control and the provision of building materials, but will also pave the way for controlling the Philippines' power industry after the dam is completed and generates electricity in the future. In addition, the Japanese "International Technical Development Corporation" has also accepted the design work for the construction of railways on Luzon Island, thereby encroaching on the Philippines' railway transportation business.
    In Vientiane, the capital of Laos, the Japanese Kawasaki Construction Company contracted for the water pipeline project last year. This is a project to draw water from the Mekong River to supply drinking water to 100,000 people, and is planned to be completed in two years, with a project cost of 600 million yen. This project is actually a prelude to the expansion of Japanese monopoly capital's "Mekong River Development" plan into countries in the Mekong River basin.
    In Indonesia, Japan's "Taisei Construction" company has already contracted for a large project to build an international hotel. In addition, "Nippon Koei" is also involved in the survey and design work for the Gariprantas River water conservancy project in Indonesia. It is said that the total value of this project is 800 million yen, and the survey and design fees alone amount to as much as 200 million yen.
    As for Japan's use of so-called "reparations" to build the Luoning power plant project in South Vietnam, it not only has ambitions for economic expansion, but also helps US imperialism strengthen its military power in South Vietnam.

### 借“合作”之名　行扩张之实  日本在海外承担工程总值将达三百亿日元

    借“合作”之名　行扩张之实
    日本在海外承担工程总值将达三百亿日元
    本报讯　据日本“每日新闻”报道，为了大举向东南亚扩张，岸信介政府的建设省于1959年新设立一个“海外合作科”。这个机构的任务主要是向东南亚各地提供建筑技术和建筑材料，为日本垄断资本的渗入开辟道路。据估计，日本可以承担的工程总值达三百亿日元。
    在菲律宾，主要是日本作为战争赔偿进行修建的玛利坚那水坝工程。这项工程预计五年完工，总工程费用为五千四百万美元，日本方面负担三千五百万美元。由于日本插手这项大水坝工程，日本垄断资本不仅在技术控制和提供建筑材料方面取得巨大好处，而且在将来水坝完工发电后，还会为控制菲律宾的动力工业铺平道路。此外，日本“国际技术开发公司”还接受了在吕宋岛修建铁路的设计工作，借此染指菲律宾的铁路交通事业。
    在老挝首都万象，日本川崎建设公司于去年包揽引水道工程。这是从湄公河引水、供十万人饮水的工程，计划两年完工，工程费用为六亿日元。这项工程实际上是日本垄断资本的“开发湄公河”计划向湄公河流域国家扩张的一个序曲。
    在印度尼西亚，日本的“大成建设”公司已经承揽了修建国际旅馆的一项大工程。此外，“日本工营”公司还参与印度尼西亚加里卜兰塔斯河水利工程的调查设计工作。据说，这项工程总值八亿日元，光是调查设计费就有二亿日元之多。
    至于日本利用所谓“赔偿”在南越修建禄宁发电厂工程，不仅具有经济扩张的野心，而且是帮助美帝国主义加强在南越的军事力量。
