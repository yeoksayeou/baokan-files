Spring Breeze, Willow Trees
Xie Yi

Last night there was a spring rain, and today is another sunny day. Looking out the window at the grape vines, I was surprised to see that they had already sprouted tens of thousands of plump buds. Picking up the newspaper that had just arrived, I learned that in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other cities, a large number of outstanding workers have become red experts. Some time ago, I attended a meeting and heard that many farmers had also become agricultural technicians. This is truly "The land of China relies on thunder and lightning for its vitality; the silence of ten thousand horses is truly lamentable. I urge the heavens to bestir themselves again and bestow talents without sticking to one pattern." Gong Zizhen's wish can only be realized today, because only the socialist era is an era of abundant talent, where outstanding people and inspiring places emerge. Today, large numbers of red experts who use both their hands and brains are springing up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain.

Most of these red experts from worker and farmer backgrounds did not have a high level of education to begin with. In the old society, they were deprived of the right to learn culture, and some were even illiterate. But now, they possess both the noble virtues of communism and rich production experience and have accumulated a certain amount of cultural and scientific knowledge. Therefore, they can create outstanding achievements on the revolutionary road. For example, Shou Kuifu of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant was just a janitor before liberation, and now he has been appointed as the chief designer of the new universal screw grinding machine. The parts processed by this grinding machine have a tolerance of only one-thirtieth of a hair's breadth. He and other designers and workers worked hard for two months and finally completed the task ahead of schedule. Another example is Lian Shouwen, a farmer from Langping Commune in Bobai County, Guangxi, who used to herd cattle and sell firewood for a living before liberation, and is now a breeding expert. He has created more than 60 new varieties of hybrid rice, with each ear generally containing three to four hundred grains, and sometimes even more. The Great Leap Forward of the past two years is like a warm spring breeze, blowing on thousands of trees and thousands of peach blossoms, blooming red and gorgeously to their heart's content.

How did these red experts become red and expert? First of all, they listen to the Party in everything and keep advancing with the red flag of revolution held high. The Party tells them: there has never been any savior, only by relying on ourselves can we save ourselves. Under the guidance of the Party, they not only broke the chains around their necks and took control of their own destiny, but also foresaw the future. Under the guidance of the Party, they rode on the socialist steed and galloped on the broad road, becoming standard-bearers who captured passes and defeated generals.

Secondly, it is because they have great ambitions and lofty aspirations, vowing to change the poor and blank state of society and resolutely charge forward for the happiness of mankind. They not only strongly possess this great desire, but also go to high altitudes, go down into pits, lay bricks and transport tiles, and are in high spirits to dedicate everything to building the socialist and communist mansion. In the struggle between society and nature, they recognized and mastered objective laws, and also changed their subjective world while changing the objective world.

Also, they possess the noble qualities of being selfless, humble, and simple, and they have displayed the communist style of daring to think, dare to do, and advance in the face of difficulties. They have armed their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, just like tigers with wings, freely flying in the vast sky. They do not avoid dangers and difficulties, make persistent efforts, and never give up until they achieve their goals.

"The spring breeze blows on thousands of willows, and the six hundred million of China are all like Yao and Shun." The new era has produced new people, and new people will promote the wheels of the era to roll forward faster.

    春风杨柳
    谢逸
    昨夜一场春雨，今天又是艳阳晴天，推窗了望架上的葡萄枝条，不想已结上了千万颗肥壮的蓓蕾了。拿起刚刚送来的报纸一看，知道北京、上海、广州以及其他各个城市，已有大批的优秀工人变成了红色专家。前些时我参加一个会议，也曾听说许多农民变成了农业技术人员。这真是“九州生气恃风雷，万马齐瘖究可哀。我劝天公重抖擞，不拘一格降人材。”龚自珍的这一愿望，直到今天才可以实现，因为只有社会主义时代，才是人才辈出的时代，人杰地灵，大批大批手脑并用的红色专家，今天已像春雨后的春笋，纷纷地冒出来了。
    这些工农出身的红色专家，绝大多数人原来的文化水平并不高，在旧社会他们被剥夺了学习文化的权利，有的还是文盲。而现在，他们既具有共产主义的崇高品德，又富有生产经验和积累了一定的文化科学知识；因而在革命道路上，就能够创造出出色的成绩。例如，上海机床厂的寿奎富，解放前只是扫地的勤杂工，现在被任命为新型万能螺丝磨床的主任设计师。这种磨床加工出来的零件，公差只有一根头发丝的三十分之一，他和其他设计人员、工人苦战了两个月，终于提前完成了任务。又如广西博白县浪平公社农民廉受文，解放前替人看牛和卖柴度日，现今成了良种专家。他共创制水稻杂交新种六十多种，每穗一般是三、四百粒，有的还要多。这两年的大跃进，正像暖和的春风，吹得那千树万树桃花，红艳艳地尽情开放。
    这些红色专家是怎样红起来和专起来的呢？首先是：事事听党的话，高举着革命红旗不断前进。党告诉他们：从来就没有什么救世主，只有靠自己才可以救自己。他们在党的指引下，不但扭断了自己颈脖上的锁链，掌握了自己的命运；而且预见了未来。在党的指引下，他们骑上了社会主义的骏马，在阳关大道上飞驰，成了夺关斩将的旗手。
    其次呢，是由于他们立雄心抱大志，誓要改变这一穷二白的社会面貌，坚决地为人类的幸福而冲锋陷阵。他们不但强烈的具有这一伟大的愿望，而且是上高空，下地坑，砌砖运瓦，意气风发地要为建筑社会主义共产主义大厦献出自己的一切。他们在社会斗争和自然斗争中认识和掌握了客观规律，而且也在改变客观世界中改变了自己的主观世界。
    还有：他们具备着大公无私、谦虚朴素的高贵品质，他们发挥了敢想敢做、知难而进的共产主义风格。他们用毛泽东思想武装了自己的头脑，就像猛虎添翼，海阔天空地自由飞翔。他们不避艰险，再接再厉，不达目的，决不罢休。
    “春风杨柳万千条，六亿神州尽舜尧”。新的时代产生了新的人物，新的人物又将要推动时代车轮更快地滚滚前进。
