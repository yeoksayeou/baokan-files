    Xinhua News Agency, 31st - The Ninth Congress of the Italian Communist Party commenced in Rome on January 30th. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent a congratulatory telegram. The full text of the congratulatory telegram is as follows: Dear Comrades,

    The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, on behalf of all members of the Chinese Communist Party, and of the Chinese people, extends warm and fraternal congratulations to all the representatives attending the Ninth Congress of the Italian Communist Party, to all the comrades of the victorious and advancing Italian Communist Party led by Comrade Togliatti, and to the Italian working class and working people.

    The Chinese Communists and the Chinese people have in the past, and continue to, follow with admiration your heroic anti-fascist struggle, and the ongoing struggle for peace, democracy and social progress. We believe that this struggle is an important part of the great movement for social progress and liberation being carried out by progressive humanity around the world. It has made, and will continue to make, significant contributions to the cause of defending world peace and striving for human progress.

    At present, the world balance of power has undergone significant changes, with the socialist forces outweighing the imperialist forces, and the forces of peace outweighing the forces of war. This has created unprecedentedly favorable conditions for the people of all countries to strive for peace. From their own experiences, the people of all countries have realized that an important guarantee for the victory of the struggle lies in strengthening the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, strengthening the unity of the international working class, strengthening the unity of the socialist forces with the national independence movement, and strengthening the unity of all peace-loving people. At the same time, they will, in the course of struggle, expose the various schemes of the enemies of peace at any time, and force the war forces and aggressive forces to retreat until peace is effectively and reliably guaranteed.

    We believe that, as an Italian Communist Party with a strong fighting spirit, rich experience in struggle, and close ties with the masses, it will, through this congress, greatly advance the cause of striving for peace, democracy and social progress, based on the current favorable international situation and the specific conditions and characteristics of Italy.

    Long live the Italian Communist Party!

    Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Italian peoples!

                        The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
                        January 28, 1960

    中共中央电贺意共代表大会
    祝争取和平、民主和社会进步事业胜利发展
    新华社31日讯　意大利共产党第九次代表大会一月三十日起在罗马举行，中国共产党中央委员会去电祝贺，贺电全文如下：亲爱的同志们：
    中国共产党中央委员会代表中国共产党全体党员和中国人民，谨向意大利共产党第九次代表大会全体代表同志，向以陶里亚蒂同志为首的胜利前进中的意大利共产党全体同志，向意大利工人阶级和劳动人民，致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    中国共产党人和中国人民，过去和现在都以钦佩的心情关怀着你们所进行过的英勇的反法西斯斗争，和正在进行着的为和平、民主和社会进步事业的斗争；并认为，这种斗争是全世界进步人类所进行的伟大的争取社会进步和解放运动的一个重要部分，它对于保卫世界和平和争取人类进步的事业，曾经而且将作出重大的贡献。
    目前世界力量对比起了显著变化，社会主义力量对于帝国主义力量、和平力量对于战争力量占了优势。它给各国人民争取和平的斗争造成了空前有利的条件。各国人民从自己的经验中已经认识到，斗争胜利的重要保证，在于加强以苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结，加强国际工人阶级的团结，加强社会主义力量同民族独立运动的团结，加强一切爱好和平的人民的团结。与此同时，他们也将在斗争中随时揭穿和平的敌人的各种诡计，迫使战争势力和侵略势力退却，直至和平得到切实可靠的保障。
    我们相信，作为一个富有战斗精神和斗争经验的、密切联系群众的意大利共产党，通过这次大会，将会根据目前有利的国际局势和意大利的具体情况和特点，把争取和平、民主和社会进步事业，向前大大推进一步。
    意大利共产党万岁！
    中意两国人民的友谊万岁！
                        中国共产党中央委员会
                        一九六○年一月二十八日
