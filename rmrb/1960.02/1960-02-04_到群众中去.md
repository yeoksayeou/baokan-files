Go Among the Masses
By our reporter Yu Xigui

	In the casting workshop of the Tianjin Tractor Factory, sparks fly and gold glitters in front of the cupola furnace. Casting engineer Li Senzi, wearing a canvas work suit blackened by oil smoke, is experimenting with using hard coal to melt iron together with the workers. He wields an iron shovel skillfully to feed coal into the furnace chamber. The raging fire illuminates their faces with a red glow. People familiar with Li Senzi believe that his ability to get along with the workers now is an unusual transformation.

	Li Senzi is a relatively well-known engineer in the Tianjin casting industry. He has worked in this factory for thirteen years and is now the deputy director of the casting workshop. In the past, although he had enthusiastically done a lot of work for casting mechanization, he was unwilling to consult with the workers on some technical issues because he could not see their wisdom, and he took many detours in his work. Once, Li Senzi wanted to reduce the cost of nodular cast iron, but without thoroughly understanding the situation, he agreed to a technician's suggestion—to reduce the magnesium content in the nodular cast iron. As a result, not only did the experiment fail, but several furnaces of waste products were produced, and the advanced electric furnace team lost its red flag. The workers were very dissatisfied and erected a wooden sign in front of his office with the words: "Why not consult with the workers? Now that there are defective products, who is responsible?" Then, the workers pointed out many shortcomings in his technique.

	Unforgettable Night Talk

	Whenever Li Senzi looks back on his tortuous journey, he is moved by an unforgettable night talk.

	One early summer evening, Liu Hande, the Party branch secretary who came from a casting background, had a heart-to-heart talk with Li Senzi. Liu Hande said: "If you had experienced the suffering the workers endured before liberation, you would definitely believe that they can do a good job of technical innovation; they will definitely come up with various ways to fight against all backward labor conditions." As Liu Hande spoke, he raised his right foot, pointed to the scars on his instep, and said painfully: "Factories before liberation didn't have any safety equipment. Look, this is where I was burned by the splashed iron water when I was working. It made me lie down for five whole months." Liu Hande looked at Li Senzi, who was silent and lost in thought, got up, paced a few steps, and suddenly turned around and said excitedly: "Lying down for five months, I didn't end up disabled. But I had an old partner who fell into a sand nest full of molten iron, and one of his legs was burned into charcoal..." He was so sad that he couldn't seem to go on. In that moment of silence, Li Senzi felt a mix of emotions and took a deep breath. At this time, Liu Hande pulled him to look at the rows of brightly lit new factory buildings outside the window. The evening breeze carried the roar of various machines, and workers coming off the night shift walked past the window humming cheerful songs. Liu Hande said: "The workers want to innovate technically not only to get rid of backward, heavy physical labor, but also because the working class, as masters of the country, is determined to change our country's 'poor and blank' state. They have such ambition and rich practical experience, why don't you rely on them?"

	Li Senzi walked out of Liu Hande's room, the night wind caressing his burning face. He thought about many questions, he carefully considered every failed technical innovation project, and finally came to the conclusion: "In the future, I must rely more on the broad masses of workers to do a good job!"

	Workers' Inspiration

	The determination to rely on the workers was made. But, could "integrating" with the workers quickly solve the problem? How to "integrate" with the workers? At that time, these were still unresolved questions for Li Senzi. With a "let's try it" attitude, he began to study some technical issues with the workers. Based on their years of practical experience, the workers put forward many methods, and many of them were more ingenious than he had thought. The newly built casting workshop in the factory did not have sand-mulling equipment or a sand-delivery system. After Li Senzi discussed it with a few workers and technicians, they decided to install a new sand-mulling equipment. However, when he returned from a visit to another place, he found that the schematic diagram of the new casting workshop did not include the sand-mulling equipment. It turned out that the workers had changed the plan after a full discussion, using only the original sand-mulling equipment in the old casting workshop, and transporting the sand to the new workshop through a belt conveyor. At that time, Li Senzi still doubted whether this approach would work. But the workers cited many facts to show that the new plan was not only possible, but also could save labor. In the face of the facts, Li Senzi deeply felt the significance of the combination of engineering and technical personnel and workers for the first time.

	The more he came into contact with the workers, the more he was inspired by the infinite wisdom of the working class. He saw the workers working tirelessly, studying measures to achieve mechanization again and again, and some technical innovation projects that he thought were difficult to achieve were also conquered by the workers with concerted efforts. He was moved by the workers' enthusiasm for accelerating socialist construction. Moved by the rich wisdom of the workers, he made up his mind: put down his airs, go among the workers, learn from the masses, and cooperate closely with the masses of workers.

	A Red Heart Works Wonders

	The factory originally used oxygen and calcium carbide flames to cut casting risers, which was very inefficient and often hindered the completion of the plan. How to completely change this backward situation? Li Senzi sought out the casting workers and consulted with the modeling workers. The workers put forward many opinions on Li Senzi's suggestion of "hammering risers," which made the promotion of "hammering risers" fast and good, increasing work efficiency by nearly a hundred times.

	In order to make the models used in the casting workshop meet the needs of mechanized production, Li Senzi decided to trial-produce advanced plastic models to replace the easily worn wooden models to make sand molds. But when he repeatedly experimented dozens of times without success, and heard some people making strange remarks, his thoughts became somewhat shaken. At this time, Comrade Sun Yiming, the Party Committee Secretary, encouraged him: "Research work cannot be successful all at once. As long as the direction is right, we must persist in the experiment." Old wood model worker Liu Zhenting knew that some people opposed the trial production of plastic models, so he posted a big-character poster to refute them. He also said kindly to Li Senzi: "It's possible to use plastic to make boats, why can't it be used to make models? Engineer Li, I think you're on the right track, keep going, don't be intimidated by the difficulties." Seeing that the Party organization and the old workers supported him in this way, Li Senzi mustered his energy and re-experimented. He actively searched for relevant information and ran almost all the related scientific research departments and institutions of higher learning in Tianjin. Since he did not understand organic chemistry, he went to other factories to consult with chemical engineers and repeatedly solicited the opinions of technicians and workers. Finally, it was decided to use the method of surface spraying with metal to increase the hardness of the plastic model. However, the cost of plastic models was too high. Old worker Liu Zhenting suggested filling the model with dry wood to save plastic and reduce costs. After testing, the effect was very good. Now, plastic models have initially replaced wooden models.

	Engineer Li Senzi, from not believing in workers to closely relying on workers and caring about workers, tried every possible means to study measures to achieve mechanization and help workers realize technical innovation proposals. All of this has been warmly welcomed and praised by the workers. After the casting workshop of this factory was rated as an advanced workshop in Hebei Province, the workers unanimously elected Li Senzi as a representative to attend the provincial "Heroes' Congress."

    到群众中去
    本报记者　虞锡珪
    在天津拖拉机厂的铸工车间里，化铁炉前火花飞溅，金光闪烁。铸工工程师李森滋穿着一身被油烟熏黑了的帆布工作服，正在和工人一起试验用硬煤化铁。只见他挥起铁锨熟练地往炉腔里送煤。熊熊的烈火把他们照映得红光满面。熟悉李森滋的人，看到他现在能这样和工人相处，都认为是个不寻常的转变。
    李森滋是天津铸工行业中比较有名望的工程师。他在这个厂工作了十三年，现在担任铸工车间副主任。过去，他虽然热心地为铸工机械化作过不少工作，但是由于看不到工人的智慧，有些技术问题不愿意和工人商量，在工作中走了许多弯路。有一次，李森滋想降低球墨铸铁的成本，没有深入了解情况，就同意了一个技术员的建议——减少球墨铸铁中镁的成份，结果不但试验没有成功，反而出了几炉废品，先进的电炉小组因此丢掉了红旗。工人们很有意见，就在他的办公室门前竖起一块木牌，上面写着：“为什么不找工人商量？现在出了废品，由谁负责？”接着，工人们在技术上给他指出了许多缺点。
    难忘的夜话
    李森滋每当回顾自己这些曲折的历程时，就为一段难忘的夜话所激动。
    那是一个初夏的夜晚，铸工出身的党支部书记刘汉德和李森滋促膝谈心。刘汉德说：“你要是尝到过工人在解放前受的疾苦，准会相信他们能搞好技术革新；他们一定会想出各种办法，向一切落后的劳动条件作斗争。”刘汉德说着说着抬起右脚，指着脚面上的一片片伤痕，沉痛地说道：“解放前的工厂，什么安全设备也谈不上。瞧，这就是在我干活时，被溅出来的铁水烫伤的。这使我整整地躺了五个月。”刘汉德望着一言不发陷入沉思的李森滋，站起来踱了几步，突然转过身来，激动地说：“躺了五个月，总算没落下残废。可是我有个老伙伴，掉进存满铁水的沙窝子里，一条腿被生生地烧成了焦炭……”他难过得好像再也说不下去了。李森滋在这刹那间的沉静里，百感交集，深深地吁了口气。这时候，刘汉德拉着他看窗外一排排灯火辉煌的新厂房，晚风传来各种机器的轰鸣，下了夜班的工人哼着轻快的歌曲从窗下走过。刘汉德说：“工人要革新技术，并不仅仅是要摆脱落后的笨重体力劳动，还因为作了国家主人的工人阶级，立志要改变我国‘一穷二白’的面貌。他们有这样的雄心，又有丰富的实际经验，你为什么不依靠他们呢？”
    李森滋从刘汉德的屋里走出来，夜风吹拂着他那火辣辣的面庞。他想了许多问题，他仔细思考了每一个失败的技术革新项目，最后得出结论：“今后要更好地依靠广大工人，才能作好工作！”
    工人的启示
    依靠工人的决心是下了。但是，和工人“结合”究竟能不能很快地解决问题？怎么样去同工人“结合”？当时对李森滋来说还是没有彻底解决的问题。他抱着“试试看”的态度，开始和工人研究一些技术问题。工人们凭着多年的实际经验，提出了很多办法，有不少办法比他想的还高明。工厂里新建的铸工车间，没有碾砂设备和送砂系统，李森滋和少数工人、技术人员商量以后，决定安装一套新的碾砂设备。但是，当他从外地参观回来，却发现新建铸工车间的示意图上，没有碾砂设备了。原来工人们经过充分讨论，改变了计划，只利用原来铸工车间的碾砂设备，通过皮带运输机，就能把砂子送到新车间。当时，李森滋还怀疑这种作法是不是行得通。但是工人们列举了很多事实，说明新方案不仅可能，而且可以节省劳力。在事实面前，李森滋第一次深深地感到了工程技术人员和工人结合的意义。
    和工人接触愈多，受到工人阶级无穷智慧的启示也愈多。他看到工人们废寝忘食，一次又一次地研究实现机械化的措施，一些他认为很难实现的技术革新项目，也都被工人们齐心攻破了。他为工人们加速社会主义建设的热情激动着。为工人丰富的智慧激动着，他下定决心：放下架子，到工人当中去，向群众学习，同工人群众紧密合作。
    心红作用大
    这个厂原来用氧气和电石的火焰切割浇铸冒口，效率很低，常常妨碍完成计划。怎样彻底改变这种落后状况呢？李森滋找铸工研究，同造型工人商量。工人们对李森滋的“冒口锤击化”的建议提出了很多意见，使“冒口锤击化”推行得又快又好，提高工作效率近一百倍。
    李森滋为了使铸工车间使用的模型，赶上机械化生产的需要，决定试制高级塑料模型代替很容易磨损的木模型来作砂模。但是当他反复试验了几十次，没有成功，听到一些人说怪话的时候，思想里就有些动摇。这时候，党委书记孙一明同志鼓励他：“研究工作不可能一下子就搞成功，只要方向对头，就要坚持试验。”老木型工刘振庭知道有人反对试制塑料模型，就贴出大字报来反驳。他还亲切地对李森滋说：“用塑料做船都行，为什么做模型就不行？李工程师，我看你这条路没错儿，接着干吧，别被困难吓住。”李森滋看到党组织和老工人这样支持他，便鼓足干劲，重新试验。他积极寻找有关资料，几乎跑遍了天津市各有关的科学研究部门和高等院校。自己不懂有机化学，就到外厂向化学工程师请教，并且反复征求技术人员和工人的意见。最后决定用表面喷金属的方法，增加塑料模型的硬度。但是塑料模型成本太高，老工人刘振庭建议在模型里填入干木头，以节省塑料，降低成本，经过试验，效果很好。现在，塑料模型代替木模型已有初步成果。
    李森滋工程师由不相信工人到紧紧地依靠工人、关心工人，千方百计地研究实现机械化的措施，帮助工人实现技术革新建议。这一切都受到工人们的热烈欢迎和赞扬。当这个厂的铸工车间被评为河北省的先进车间以后，工人们一致推选李森滋为代表去出席全省的“群英会”。
