Grasp the Main Links to Increase Hemp Production
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute

Hemp is one of China's major bast fiber crops, with a long history of cultivation and a wide distribution area. In addition to being mainly used as a raw material for high-grade paper, hemp fiber is also used as a raw material for fishing nets, ropes, sewing thread, and textiles. Hemp fiber is also an important export commodity for China. This shows that developing hemp production and increasing yield per unit area are of great significance to China's socialist construction.

Since liberation, China's hemp production has developed rapidly, with yield per unit area increasing year by year, and total output also increasing year by year. The total output in 1949 was 960,000 dan, which rose to 2,920,000 dan in 1958. In 1959, although the major hemp-producing areas in China suffered droughts and hailstorms of varying degrees, thanks to the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, the natural disasters were successfully overcome. On the basis of the great leap forward in 1958, the people's communes in the hemp-producing areas achieved another large-scale bumper harvest. For example, in Wei County, a key hemp-producing area in Hebei Province, more than 70,000 mu of hemp had an average yield of 111 jin per mu, an increase of 7% compared with 1958. Last year, Hunyuan County, Shanxi Province, had more than 7,000 mu of hemp, with a yield of 110 jin per mu, an increase of 39.2% compared with 1958. The Huangzhuang Brigade of the Bianyuan Commune in Feicheng County, Shandong Province, had 450 mu of hemp, with an average yield of 220 jin per mu, an increase of 29.4% compared with 1958. The above shows that in 1959, under the brilliant light of the general line, the broad masses of commune members continued to exert their efforts, earnestly implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, and promoted various advanced hemp cultivation techniques, thereby achieving another large-scale bumper harvest.

　　Deep Plowing and Fine Harrowing, Increasing the Application of Base Fertilizer

Hemp is a kind of industrial raw material with high economic value. Commune members in hemp-producing areas choose superior farmland near villages to grow hemp, applying more fertilizer and managing it carefully. Therefore, hemp land is more fertile than general farmland, so hemp farmers are accustomed to continuous cropping of hemp in the original hemp land. Can new hemp land also achieve high yields? According to the experimental results of the Jin Southeast Agricultural Science Research Institute of Shanxi Province, planting hemp in new stubble land can also obtain high yields as long as attention is paid to fine land preparation, increasing fertilizer application, and strengthening field management. For example, the farm of the institute planted hemp after rice, with a yield of 207 jin per mu. Such a yield is not low. At present, the communes in various hemp-producing areas have carried out land planning, and some hemp land will inevitably be moved to new stubble. Increasing fertilizer application and strengthening field management on new stubble has become a very important thing.

The experience of high yields in various places proves that timely early plowing and deep plowing of hemp land are the foundation for obtaining bumper harvests. Combining deep plowing with sufficient base fertilizer application has a better effect. However, at present, the fertilization habits in various hemp-producing areas mostly involve applying base fertilizer during spring plowing. The experience of high yields in the northern hemp-producing areas in the past two or three years has proven that autumn application of base fertilizer is better than spring application. Autumn application of base fertilizer can fully decompose and decompose the fertilizer, making it easier for hemp to absorb. However, in the case of insufficient fertilizer application in autumn, it must be replenished in spring.

Cultivating hemp land requires not only autumn plowing but also spring plowing. Experience has shown that meticulous early spring plowing can not only conserve moisture but also increase soil temperature, which is conducive to fine land preparation and facilitates emergence.

　　Timely Early Sowing, Reasonable Close Planting

The sowing period of hemp varies from place to place due to different geographical conditions. Anhui is generally in late February, Shandong in mid-April, Hebei in early to mid-May, and Shanxi in late April. Late sowing of hemp results in rapid emergence due to high temperatures, and the hemp seedlings grow tall, thin, and weak, making them prone to lodging. Early sowing of hemp extends the growth period, and the hemp seedlings grow slowly in the lower temperature conditions, the main stem elongates slowly, the root system is developed, and the hollow node position of the pith is increased. The plant is healthy and uniform, has strong resistance to lodging, and has fewer small hemp plants. Based on the above reasons, since 1958, high-yielding fields in various places have adopted the measure of timely early sowing, and the sowing period of large-scale high-yielding fields in 1959 was also advanced by five to twenty days compared with general fields. According to surveys, hemp seedlings can tolerate low temperatures during the seedling stage. The suitable sowing period for hemp is late January in Anhui, late March in Shandong, and mid-to-late April in Hebei.

The cultivation density of hemp varies from place to place due to environmental conditions or cultivation habits. In Anhui, due to the long growth period and abundant rainfall, the hemp plants grow tall, so the cultivation density is relatively small, at 40,000 to 50,000 plants per mu. In Shandong, the hemp growth period is shorter, and harvesting is done before the rainy season. The hemp plants are also shorter, and there is a custom of close planting, so the cultivation density is relatively large. In Hebei and Shanxi, the hemp harvest is later than in Shandong, and the later growth period is during the rainy season. The hemp plants are taller than in Shandong, so the cultivation density is relatively small. According to the 1958 survey, there are still uneven distribution and uneven height of hemp plants in the hemp fields; there are many small hemp plants, which affect the increase in fiber yield. This shows that controlling or reducing the production of small hemp plants from the cultivation measures is indeed the central link of reasonable close planting. According to the survey, although the cultivation density of large-scale high-yielding hemp fields last year was larger than the previous year, the number of small hemp plants did not increase with the increase in density, but showed a downward trend due to the adoption of effective technical measures such as fine land preparation, fine seed selection, timely thinning and setting seedlings, and phased uniform topdressing. The number of small hemp plants in high-yielding fields decreased from 20-25% in 1958 to about 15%. This shows that from the measures of land preparation, fine seed selection, thinning, and fertilization technology, the number of small hemp plants can be effectively reduced, and the corresponding increase in effective hemp plants can increase the fiber content.

　　Timely Topdressing, Reasonable Irrigation and Drainage

The experience of high hemp yields in 1959 pointed out that phased topdressing according to the growth characteristics of hemp plants is one of the important links to obtain high yields. According to the survey, hemp grows slowly before it is one foot tall, and generally no topdressing or a small amount is applied. After one foot, the hemp plants grow faster and begin to be topdressed to meet the needs of rapid growth and development of hemp plants. In the northern hemp-producing areas, due to the short growing days of hemp plants, topdressing is generally done twice, and three times in individual high-yielding fields. In Anhui, due to the long growing days of hemp plants, topdressing is generally done three times, and four times in individual high-yielding areas. In terms of fertilization technology, in order to improve fertilizer efficiency, the method of fertilization should also be based on the seedlings, the weather, and the land. Topdressing based on seedlings is to apply less fertilizer or phased multiple topdressing to healthy hemp seedlings to prevent the hemp seedlings from growing too tall and lodging. When the hemp plants are about three feet tall, topdress the short areas once to make them grow uniformly, which is topdressing based on seedlings. Topdressing based on the weather is to prevent fertilizer loss, and no topdressing is done on rainy days or windy days. Topdressing based on the land is to apply slow-acting fertilizers if the land is fertile, to prevent excessive growth and lodging; apply fast-acting chemical fertilizers or human manure to barren land to promote rapid growth of hemp seedlings. In addition, attention should be paid to the appropriate combination of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers according to needs.

Due to different climatic conditions in various places, the requirements for drainage and irrigation vary in different hemp-producing areas. In Anhui, drainage is very important in the early stage of hemp growth due to frequent rainfall in spring. Ditches must be cleared at any time to prevent blockage, so as to facilitate drainage, otherwise it will hinder the growth of hemp seedlings. In the northern hemp-producing areas, irrigation is important because of frequent spring droughts; otherwise, it will not be possible to ensure the harvest. In order to ensure the good growth of hemp, the commune members in the northern hemp-producing areas of China have put forward a scientifically sound irrigation experience of "not being afraid of the late first watering, the second watering should catch up, and the third and fourth waterings are closely connected" based on years of experience. It pointed out that within one month after hemp begins to emerge, the soil moisture can still supply the needs of hemp seedlings, and there is no need to irrigate too early to promote root development and facilitate the healthy growth of hemp plants; if irrigation is done early, the soil is prone to crusting and cracking after irrigation, which hinders the growth of hemp plants, because the hemp plants are small and the hemp leaves are few and cannot cover the ground; at the same time, early irrigation can also easily make the hemp seedlings grow too tall and are prone to lodging in the wind. One month after emergence, due to the increase in temperature, the plants enter a period of vigorous growth, the hemp plants begin to hollow out, the growth rate increases, and the water demand is high, so irrigation must be continued, otherwise the plants will stop growing. The northern hemp-producing areas can refer to this experience and irrigate hemp fields in accordance with local conditions.

    抓住大麻增产的主要环节
    中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所
    大麻为我国主要麻类作物之一，栽培历史久，分布区域广。大麻纤维除了主要用做高级纸张原料以外，还用做渔网、绳索、缝鞋线和纺织品原料。大麻纤维，同时还是我国的一种重要的出口物资。这说明发展大麻生产，提高单位面积产量，对我国社会主义建设具有重大的意义。
    解放以来，我国大麻生产发展很快，单位面积产量逐年提高，总产量也年年增加。1949年总产量九十六万担，1958年就上升到二百九十二万担。1959年我国主要大麻产区，虽然都遭受了程度不同的旱灾和雹灾，但由于人民公社发挥了无比的优越性，胜利地战胜了自然灾害，麻区各人民公社在1958年大跃进的基础上，又获得了大面积丰收。如河北省重点麻区的蔚县，全县七万多亩大麻，平均亩产一百一十一斤，比1958年增产7％。山西省浑源县去年的七千多亩大麻，单产一百一十斤，比1958年增产39．2％。山东省肥城县边院公社黄庄大队的四百五十亩大麻，平均亩产二百二十斤，比1958年增产29．4％。以上说明，1959年广大公社社员在总路线的光辉照耀下，继续鼓足干劲，认真贯彻农业“八字宪法”，推行了各项大麻先进栽培技术措施，从而又获得了大面积丰收。
        深耕细耙，增施基肥
    大麻是经济价值很高的一种工业原料作物，麻区社员都选用靠近村庄附近上等田地种麻，施肥多，管理细致。因而麻地比一般大田肥沃，所以麻农多习惯在原麻地连作大麻。新麻地是不是也能获得高产呢？据山西省晋东南农业科学研究所试验结果证明，新茬地种麻，只要注意精细整地，增施肥料，加强田间管理，也能获得丰产。如该所农场种在前茬水稻的大麻亩产二百零七斤。这样的单产是不低的。目前各麻区公社都已进行了土地规划，部分大麻地必将移往新茬，对新茬增施肥料，加强田间管理，就成为很重的事情。
    各地丰产经验证明，大麻地适时早耕和深耕是获得丰收的基础。结合深耕，施足基肥，效果更好。但目前各麻区在施肥习惯上，大多是春耕时施用基肥。北方麻区最近二、三年来丰产经验证明，基肥春施不如秋施好，秋施基肥能够使肥料充分腐熟分解，容易为大麻所吸收。但在秋季施肥不足的情况下，必须在春季补足。
    栽培大麻地不仅要秋耕，而且要春耕。经验证明，细致的进行早春耕不但可以保墒，而且能提高土壤温度，便于精细整地，有利出苗。
      适期早播，合理密植
    大麻播种期，因地而异。安徽一般在2月下旬，山东在4月中旬，河北在5月上中旬，山西在4月下旬。大麻晚播，由于气温高，出苗快，麻苗陡长细弱，容易倒伏；适期早播的大麻生长期延长，麻苗在较低温度条件下，主茎伸长慢、根系发达，同时髓部空心节位提高，植株发育健壮整齐，抗倒伏力较强，细小麻株数少。基于以上原因，1958年以来，各地丰产田都采用了适期早播的措施，1959年大面积丰产田的播种期也比一般田提早五到二十天。据调查，大麻苗期是能忍受低温的。大麻的适宜播种期，安徽地区可提早至1月下旬，山东3月下旬，河北4月中下旬。
    大麻栽培密度，由于环境条件或栽培习惯关系，各地不一。安徽地区由于生长期较长，雨水多，麻株长得高，因而栽培密度较小，每亩为四至五万株。山东地区大麻生长期较短，雨季前即行收获，麻株也较矮，同时又习惯于密植，因而栽培密度较大。河北、山西地区大麻收获较山东晚，生长后期又值雨季，麻株较山东高，因而它的栽培密度较小。根据1958年的调查，麻田内的麻株仍有分布不匀和高矮不一的现象；细小麻株数多，影响纤维产量的提高。这说明从栽培措施上控制或减少细小麻株的产生，确是合理密植的中心环节。据调查，去年大麻大面积丰产田的栽培密度，虽较前年增大，但由于采用了精细整地、精选种子、及时间苗定苗和分期均匀追肥等有效的技术措施，细小麻株不但没有随密度增大而增加，反有下降趋势，丰产田的细小麻株数，由1958年的20—25％下降到15％左右。这说明从整地、精选种子、间苗和施肥技术等措施上，能有效的减少细小麻株数，相应的增加有效麻株，增加纤维量。
        及时追肥，合理排灌
    1959年大麻丰产经验指出，根据麻株生长特性，进行分期追肥，是获得丰产的重要环节之一。据调查，大麻一尺高以前生长缓慢，一般不施追肥或施用少量，一尺高以后，麻株生长加快，开始追肥满足麻株迅速生长发育的需要。追肥次数，北方麻区由于麻株生育日数较短，一般追肥二次，个别丰产田三次。安徽地区由于麻株生育日数较长，一般追肥三次，个别丰产地四次。在施肥技术上，为了提高肥效还应采取看苗、看天、看地的施肥方法。看苗追肥是对健壮麻苗少追肥或分期多次追肥，以防止麻苗陡长倒伏。麻株三尺左右时，把过矮的地方追肥一次，使之生长整齐，这就是看苗追肥。看天追肥是为了防止肥份流失，连雨天不追，大风天不追。看地追肥是如果地肥沃，施迟效性肥料，以防止陡长倒伏；地瘠施速效性化肥或人粪尿，促进麻苗迅速生长。此外，应该根据需要，注意磷钾肥料的适当配合施用。
    由于各地气候条件的不同，各个麻区对排灌的要求也不一样。安徽麻区由于春季多雨，大麻生长前期排水问题很重要，必须随时清沟，防止堵塞，以利排水，否则有碍麻苗生长。北方麻区，因常有春旱，必须重视灌溉问题，否则就不能保收。为了保证大麻生长良好，我国北方麻区的社员，根据多年来的经验，曾提出了一个合乎科学道理的“不怕头水晚，二水要来赶，三水、四水紧相连”的灌溉经验。它指出：大麻开始出苗后一个月内，土壤水分还能供应麻苗生长需要，可以不要过早灌水，以促进根系发育，有利麻株健壮生长；如灌水提早，由于麻株小，麻叶少，麻叶盖不住地面，灌水后土壤容易板结龟裂，有碍麻株生长；同时早灌水还容易使麻苗陡长，遇风容易倒伏。到出苗一个月以后，由于温度增高，植株进入生长旺盛时期，麻株开始空心，生长速度增大，需水量多，必须继续进行灌溉，否则植株就会停止生长。北方麻区可以参照这个经验，因地制宜，灌溉麻田。
