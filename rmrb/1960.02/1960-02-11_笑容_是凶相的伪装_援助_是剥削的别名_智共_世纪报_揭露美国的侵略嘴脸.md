    "Smiles" are a disguise for ferocity; "Aid" is another name for exploitation
    Chilean Communist "Siglo" exposes the ugly face of American aggression
    (Dispatch from this newspaper) The Chilean Communist newspaper "Siglo" recently published an article exposing the aggressive essence of American policy towards Latin America.
    The article pointed out, "Now the American government wants to put on a more smiling, more amiable ‘other face’ towards Latin American countries, and claims that it will increase dollar ‘aid.’ Even Eisenhower himself will visit South America. But the real situation is that increasing ‘aid’ only means that imperialism is intensifying its control and exploitation of our countries. In any case, the people of Latin America are prepared to repel such conspiracies and not relax their struggle against the common enemy."

    “笑容”是凶相的伪装  “援助”是剥削的别名
    智共“世纪报”揭露美国的侵略嘴脸
    本报讯　智利共产党报纸“世纪报”最近发表文章，揭露美国对拉丁美洲政策的侵略实质。
    文章指出，“现在美国政府想对拉丁美洲国家装出更带笑容，更为慈祥的‘另一副嘴脸’，并且声称它将增加美元的‘援助’，甚至连艾森豪威尔本人也将到南美来访问。但是确实的情况是，增加‘援助’只意味着帝国主义加紧对我们这些国家的控制和剥削。无论如何，拉丁美洲的人民已准备击退这样的阴谋，不放松反对共同敌人的斗争。”
