    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing Electric Dispatch: Zhang Xianglong, a lathe operator in the machine workshop of the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant in Jiangsu Province, with the help of his colleagues, has recently successfully created a "building block universal fixture base" after a full year of painstaking research. This fixture base can process more than twenty different types of "valve" products and can be universally applied to more than sixty different processes, replacing the very troublesome manual processing techniques, increasing efficiency by one to three times, and overcoming a long-standing weak link in locomotive and rolling stock production.
    The universal fixture base created by Zhang Xianglong is both simple and ingenious. By simply installing a pre-made small fixture and several shims in a fixture base made of triangular iron, it can be used to process products; after replacing one or several parts, it can be used to process another product. According to trials, this set of fixtures can process a total of twelve types of straight-through plug valves, twenty-four types of accessories, and more than sixty processes. Using this set of universal fixture bases, many workpieces can be cut as soon as they are placed on it, without any need for auxiliary adjustment time, so the processing efficiency is generally increased by one to three times, and the product quality can be guaranteed to be 100% up to standard.
    The "valve" styles of locomotives and rolling stock are very complex, and the valve group to which Zhang Xianglong belongs regularly processes more than fifty types. In the past, when workers processed these "valves," they had to draw horizontal lines and make vertical corrections, and could only process three or four pieces a day, and the scrap rate was high. In April of last year, Zhang Xianglong made a fixture for processing the thermal pipe stop valve. The trial results showed that the efficiency was increased by more than three times, the quality was 100% up to the requirements, and the work was both easy and convenient.
    However, Zhang Xianglong was not satisfied with this. He further envisioned creating a universal fixture that could process a variety of products. Workshop director Gu Xiaoxing personally helped him find materials and process parts; other workers also gave him some useful suggestions. After more than half a year of hard work, the "building block universal fixture base" finally broke through many difficulties and was successfully born.

    张祥龙制成“积木式万能夹具胎”
    可加工二十多种“阀类”产品　通用于六十多道工序
    据新华社南京电　江苏省戚墅堰机车车辆厂机械车间车工张祥龙，在同伴们的帮助下，经过了整整一年的刻苦研究，最近创制成功“积木式万能夹具胎”。这个夹具胎能够加工二十多种不同的“阀类”产品，可以通用于六十多道不同的工序，用来代替十分麻烦的手工加工工艺，使工效提高一到三倍，克服了机车车辆生产中一个长期以来未能克服的薄弱环节。
    张祥龙创造的万能夹具胎既简单又灵巧，只要在一块三角铁做的夹具胎里，装上一个预先做好的小夹具和几块垫铁，就可以用来加工产品；更换一个或几个零件后，又可以加工另一种产品。根据试用，这套胎具总共可以加工十二种直通塞门、二十四种配件、六十多道工序。使用这套万能夹具胎，许多工作物放上去就可切削，根本不需要校调的辅助时间，因此加工效率普遍提高一倍至三倍，产品质量可以保证百分之百合乎规格。
    机车车辆的“阀类”式样非常复杂，张祥龙所在的阀类小组经常加工的就有五十多种。过去，工人加工这些“阀类”时，横划线、竖校正，一天只能加工三、四只，而且废品率较高。张祥龙在去年4月曾经做出一只加工热力管止阀的夹具。试用结果，效率提高三倍多，质量百分之百符合要求，工作起来既轻快又灵便。
    但是，张祥龙并不以此为满足。他又进一步设想创造一种万能夹具，使之能加工多种产品。工长顾筱兴亲自帮他寻找材料和加工零件；其他工人也为他提了一些有益的建议。经过半年多的苦干，“积木式万能夹具胎”终于冲破重重困难胜利诞生了。
