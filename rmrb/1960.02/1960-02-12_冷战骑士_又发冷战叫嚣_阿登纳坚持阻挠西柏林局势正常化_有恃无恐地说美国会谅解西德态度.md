Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, 10th — The West German Federal Parliament held a debate on foreign policy issues today. West German Chancellor Adenauer and Foreign Minister Brentano once again issued Cold War bluster against the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic on the West Berlin issue during the debate, and stated that West Germany would insist on obstructing the relaxation of the international situation and the normalization of the West Berlin situation.

Adenauer repeated the platitude in his speech that "the current legal status of (West) Berlin must not be changed until the entire German issue is resolved." He wants Western countries and West Germany to "recognize their own strength."

Adenauer demanded that all West German political parties support the West German government's policy of obstructing the relaxation of the international situation and its rigid policy. Adenauer said that the West German government is drafting a document on the status of Berlin, especially West Berlin. He said that when he visits the United States next month to meet with US President Eisenhower, he will raise West Germany's position again. He said complacently that the United States would understand West Germany's attitude.

Before Adenauer's speech, West German Foreign Minister Brentano also reiterated the rigid attitude of not recognizing the German Democratic Republic and not negotiating with the German Democratic Republic. He also clung to the so-called "package plan" proposed by Western countries at the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference to obstruct the solution of the German issue and the West Berlin issue, saying that this is the only starting point for future negotiations.

    “冷战骑士”又发冷战叫嚣
    阿登纳坚持阻挠西柏林局势正常化
    有恃无恐地说美国会谅解西德态度
    据新华社波恩10日电　西德联邦议院今天举行外交政策问题辩论。西德总理阿登纳和外交部长勃伦塔诺在辩论中又一次就西柏林问题发出反对苏联和德意志民主共和国的冷战叫嚣，并且表示西德要坚持阻挠国际局势缓和和西柏林局势正常化。
    阿登纳在发言中重复“在整个德国问题得到解决以前不允许改变（西）柏林现在的法律地位”的滥调。他要西方国家和西德“认识自己的实力”。
    阿登纳要求西德各政党支持西德政府阻挠国际局势缓和和僵硬政策，阿登纳说，西德政府正在就柏林、特别是西柏林地位问题草拟一项文件。他说，在他下月访问美国同美国总统艾森豪威尔会谈时将再提出西德的立场。他有恃无恐地说，美国会对西德的态度表示谅解的。
    在阿登纳之前发言的西德外交部长勃伦塔诺也再次表示不承认德意志民主共和国和不同德意志民主共和国谈判的僵硬态度，他还死抱住西方国家在日内瓦外长会议上提出的用来阻挠解决德国问题和西柏林问题的所谓“一揽子计划”，他说，这是未来谈判唯一的起点。
