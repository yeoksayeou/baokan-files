Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 19th: U.S. Secretary of State Herter testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 1961 "Mutual Security Program." Like Eisenhower, Herter, in his speech, tried his best to use the lie of the so-called communist "threat" to cover up the U.S.'s purpose of coercing its puppet states to expand their armaments and prepare for war and serve the U.S.'s aggressive policies. He falsely accused the socialist camp of being a "vast empire" that has been "expanding by force or the threat of force," and is a serious "threat" to the "security" of the United States. He clamored that this "threat" must be dealt with "effectively." He said that for more than a decade, the United States has been formulating its policies based on this principle, that is, not only does the United States itself maintain a strong military force, but it also actively assists those countries that "need help." He believes that this is "an indispensable and inseparable measure for the security of the United States itself."

Herter expressed his approval of the so-called "Mutual Security Program" proposed by Eisenhower to expand foreign military and economic "aid." He emphasized that this program is indispensable for maintaining and enhancing the "national interests" of the United States. He said that the primary purpose of this program is to maintain sufficient so-called "defense forces." He said that in order to achieve this goal, the United States will continue to provide military equipment and military training to other countries, and keep them "elite." For those puppet states that do not have the strength to bear huge armies, the United States will, as in the past, give them "increased appropriations" so that they can maintain "sufficient" military forces.

In analyzing the world situation, Herter showed great alarm at the unprecedented strength of the socialist camp and the vigorous development of national independence movements. He admitted that, in addition to the so-called "free countries," one-third of the world's people now live in socialist countries. Moreover, in addition to this, there are hundreds of millions of oppressed people who are "trying their best to get rid of poverty" and are "looking for the most effective shortcuts to improve their material conditions." He believes that this is a "grim" fact for the United States.

In his speech, Herter had to admit the enormous attraction of the example of socialist countries in underdeveloped regions. He said that the "characteristics" of these many countries are that "they have a profound and growing desire and determination to improve their conditions and achieve material progress. The communist's radical solution points the way towards the goal of peace and prosperity in the ultimate and visible classless society. Therefore, it is not surprising that this solution can appeal to some people who are dissatisfied and anxious because of the extreme lack of material resources and skilled cadres."

Herter continued, saying that under these circumstances, the United States must not "stand idly by." He said that in order to resist this attraction, it is necessary to give these countries a "path" guided by the United States that is "other than the communist method." He said that the policy and practice of the United States "has been to try its best to provide this assistance." But he then emphasized that this "assistance" from the United States is not a "charitable undertaking," but because doing so is in the "interests" of the United States.

    赫脱对“美援”侵略实质供认不讳
    “援外”并非慈悲事业只是符合美国利益
    据新华社19日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿赫脱17日在众议院外交委员会就1961年度“共同安全计划”作证，同艾森豪威尔一样，赫脱在讲话中竭力用所谓共产主义“威胁”的谎言，来掩盖美国胁迫它的仆从国家扩军备战并为美国侵略政策服务的目的。他诬蔑社会主义阵营是“庞大的帝国”，一直“以武力或武力威胁进行扩张”，是对美国的“安全”的一个严重的“威胁”，他叫嚣必须“有效地”对付这种“威胁”。他说，十多年来美国一直是根据这一方针制定它的政策，这就是不仅美国本身保持了强大的军事力量，而且积极援助那些“需要帮助”的国家。他认为这是对美国“自身安全的一项必不可少的不可分割的措施”。
    赫脱表示赞同艾森豪威尔所提出的扩大对外军事和经济“援助”的所谓“共同安全计划”。他强调这一计划是保持和增进美国“国家利益”所不可缺少的。他说这一计划的首要目的就是保持足够的所谓“防御力量”。他说为了达到这个目的，美国要继续向其他国家提供军事装备和军事训练，并使之保持“精锐”，对于那些没有力量负担庞大军队的仆从国家，美国将像以往那样给它们“增加拨款”，使它们能保持“足够的”军事力量。
    赫脱在分析世界形势时，对社会主义阵营的空前强大和民族独立运动蓬勃发展表现出极大的惊惧。他承认，除了所谓“自由国家”外，世界上现在已经有三分之一的人民生活在社会主义的国度里，而且除此以外，还有数以亿计的被压迫人民“正在竭力摆脱贫穷”，正在“寻找改善他们物质条件的最有效的捷径”。他认为对美国来说这是“严酷”的事实。
    赫脱在讲话中不得不承认社会主义国家的榜样在不发达的地区巨大的吸引力。他说，这许多国家的“特点是，它们有着深刻的、日益增长的愿望和决心来改善自己的状况和取得物质上的进步。共产主义的彻底解决办法指出了最终和可见的无阶级社会中的和平和繁荣目标的方向。因此，这种解决办法能够吸引一些由于物质资源和熟练干部十分缺少而感到不满和焦急的人，是并不奇怪的。”
    赫脱继续说，在这种情况下，美国绝不能“袖手旁观”。他说，为了抵抗这种吸引力，必须给这些国家一种“共产主义办法以外”的由美国所指引的“道路”。他说，美国的政策和实践“一直是尽力提供这种援助”。但是他接着强调，美国的这种“援助”并不是“慈悲事业”，而是因为这样做是符合美国的“利益”的。
