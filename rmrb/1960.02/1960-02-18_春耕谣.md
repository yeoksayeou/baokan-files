    Spring Plowing Rhyme
    People's Commune Manages Heaven and Earth
    Not waiting for the lark to open its mouth,
    Not waiting for the swallows to enter the house,
    The People's Commune manages heaven and earth,
    Arranging spring plowing production early.
    (Yu Ruxi, Anong Commune, Anyue)
    Good News Like February Flowers
    The red sun rises, filling the sky with rosy clouds,
    Commune members laugh heartily during spring plowing,
    Their enthusiasm is fiercer than the Yangtze River,
    Good news is like February flowers.
      (Luo Liangzhong, Heping Commune, Santai)
    New Things Aplenty in Spring Plowing Days
    New things aplenty in spring plowing days,
    Plowing sisters smile cheerfully,
    A passerby asks for directions on the road,
    Mistaking the girl for an older brother.
                  (Xing Guang)
    An Inch of Springtime is Worth a Load of Gold
    The bugler, Yu Dafa,
    Hangs a brass bugle at his waist.
    He directs work start and end,
    The brass bugle blows "dee-dee-da,"
    Since the beginning of the Spring Festival,
    Things suddenly changed:
    When he blows the work start signal,
    Commune members are already in the fields;
    When he blows the work end signal,
    Commune members are always reluctant to go home.
    Dafa got anxious and angry,
    And spoke to the commune members:
    "You all listened to my commands in the past,
    Why has it changed now?"
    Everyone answered in unison:
    "Look what season it is,
    An inch of springtime is worth a load of gold."
          (Chun Niu, Chun Miao)

    春耕谣
    人民公社管天地
    不等阳雀把口开，
    不等燕子进屋来，
    人民公社管天地，
    春耕生产早安排。
    （安岳安农公社余如喜）
    喜报好比二月花
    红日东升满天霞，
    社员春耕笑哈哈，
    干劲猛过长江水，
    喜报好比二月花。
      （三台和平公社罗良中）
    春耕日子新事多
    春耕日子新事多，
    犁田姐姐笑呵呵，
    道上行人来问路，
    错把姑娘叫大哥。
                  （星光）
    一寸春光一担金
    司号员，余大发，
    一把铜号腰间挂。
    上工下工他指挥，
    铜号吹得嘀嘀?，
    自从春节一开始，
    事情突然起变化：
    当他吹响出工号，
    社员早就把地下；
    当他吹响收工号，
    社员老是不回家。
    大发急得生了气，
    忙向社员发了话：
    “往天都听我指挥，
    如今为啥变了卦？”
    大家一齐把话答：
    “你看这是啥季节，
    一寸春光一担金。”
          （春牛、春苗）
