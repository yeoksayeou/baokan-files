    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, February 18th: The Cuban Rebel Army, while constantly preparing to defend the revolution and resist foreign aggression, is also a massive force for labor and production. In their labor, they display the same fighting enthusiasm they showed during the armed struggle to overthrow the dictatorial regime. Currently, more than half of the soldiers are working hard throughout the country—in the mountains, fields, and on roads—with their weapons at their sides, wielding shovels and driving tractors.

    In the sugarcane fields, soldiers are harvesting sugarcane alongside farmers to avoid the threat of incendiary bombs dropped by American planes. In Caney, in the Sierra Maestra mountains, the old revolutionary base of Cuba, soldiers are building a school district to accommodate 20,000 farmers' children. In Coralillo, Holguin, Mercedes, and Elia, soldiers are building schools day and night. In the Escambray Mountains in central Cuba, soldiers are building six schools and orphanages. In Elia, soldiers are sweating profusely under the hot sun to build roads to turn the local hot springs into an important tourist center.

    Currently, a large number of Cuban soldiers are actively participating in the construction of the Zapata Swamp water conservancy project, overcoming numerous difficulties. When these water conservancy projects are completed, they will provide more than 10,000 caballeries of fertile land. Ariguanabo and Manzanillo in Oriente Province will soon become fishing centers. In Prio, soldiers have also built residential areas for farmers. Some soldiers also work in the Suruuta quarry, cement plant, and building materials factory in Las Villas Province. Most of the leaders doing land reform work in the twenty-seven agricultural development zones are officers of the Rebel Army. Many cooperative chairmen are demobilized soldiers. Soldiers and farmers are implementing land reform and crop diversification plans together.

    拿起枪杆保卫革命　挥动铁铲建设祖国
    古巴起义军参加生产
    新华社哈瓦那18日电　正在时刻准备着保卫革命和反对外国侵略的古巴起义军同时也是一支劳动和生产大军。他们在劳动中，发挥着以前在推翻独裁政权的武装斗争中的那种战斗热情。目前，半数以上的士兵正在全国各地——山上、田野里和公路上，把武器放在身旁，挥动着铁铲，驾驶着拖拉机，从事紧张的劳动。
    在甘蔗地里，士兵们同农民一起抢收甘蔗，以免遭受来自美国的飞机投掷燃烧弹的威胁。在古巴革命老根据地马埃斯特腊山区的卡内，士兵们正在建造容纳二万农民子弟的学校区。在科拉利略、奥尔金、梅塞德斯和埃耳格亚，士兵们日日夜夜地在建筑学校。在古巴中部埃斯卡姆布赖山区，士兵们在建筑六所学校和孤儿院。在埃耳格亚的士兵们不顾炎热的太阳满身大汗地在修建公路，以便把这个地方的温泉变成重要的游览中心。
    目前大批的古巴士兵正在克服重重困难，积极参加萨帕塔沼池水利工程的建设。这些水利工程完工后将得到一万多卡瓦耶里亚的肥沃土地。奥连特省的阿里瓜纳沃和曼萨尼罗不久将成为捕鱼的中心。在普里奥，士兵们还建筑了农民住宅区。还有些士兵在拉斯维利亚斯省的苏鲁塔采石厂、水泥厂和建筑材料厂里工作。在二十七个农业发展区里大部分做土地改革工作的负责人都是起义军的军官。合作社的许多社长是由复员的士兵担任的。士兵和农民一起实行土地改革和耕作多样化计划。
