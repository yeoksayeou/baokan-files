Xinhua News Agency, Rome, February 2nd: The Ninth Congress of the Italian Communist Party discussed the report made by the party's General Secretary Togliatti to the congress on January 31st and February 1st: "Striving for Democratic Renewal of Italian Society, Striving for Progress Towards Socialism."

    Giancarlo Pajetta, member of the Political Bureau of the Italian Communist Party, spoke about the central issue in Italian politics, namely, the issue of striving to establish a new majority capable of implementing the program of social democratic renewal. He said that this issue arises because the old majority composed of the Christian Democratic Party, the Liberal Party, the Republican Party, and the Social Democratic Party has gone bankrupt, and no one wants to restore this majority; on the other hand, the current majority composed of the Christian Democratic Party, the Monarchist Party, and neo-fascists is experiencing a crisis.

    Pajetta emphasized that the Communist Party's exploration of Italy's path to socialism should not be limited to theoretical discussions; the mass struggle is of decisive significance.

    Pajetta then said that the Christian Democratic Party's attempt to establish a new regional majority in Sicily that includes Socialists while excluding Communists has failed. The Christian Democratic Party ran into obstacles because it wanted to pursue the old policy of discrimination and anti-communism in the new situation. Pajetta pointed out that it is not only legitimate but also necessary and indispensable for us to participate in the new majority. He said that it is absolutely impossible to establish a new anti-communist majority by excluding the seven million voters who voted for the Communist Party and going against millions of other Italians who do not agree with anti-communism.

    Piero Morollo, a worker at the "Lancia" automobile factory in Turin, said in his speech that by uniting the efforts of the workers with the efforts of all working people and all Italians with democratic demands, a broad anti-fascist front can be established, which can block the road to the revival of racism and Nazism and prevent history from repeating itself.

    Vilio Spano, a member of the party's leadership, elaborated on international issues in his speech. He said that in order to ensure a genuine relaxation of international tension, the proponents of the "Cold War" must be thoroughly defeated. Comprehensive and complete disarmament must be achieved, as proposed by Soviet government leader Khrushchev at the United Nations General Assembly.

    Spano then said that the Soviet Union has set an example for other countries by reducing its armed forces by one-third, and Italy should follow suit. Spano then suggested passing a resolution in support of the Algerian people, which was adopted amid a long ovation from the delegates.

    Luigi Longo, Deputy General Secretary of the Communist Party, pointed out in a long speech that the forces striving for the relaxation of the international situation are strong, but the influence of the groups that are determined to oppose relaxation cannot be ignored. He emphasized that it must be understood that there are still considerable forces opposing relaxation, both internationally and domestically. He said that the process of easing tension will not come automatically.

    Speaking about domestic issues, Longo said that in order to achieve democracy, all forces of peace and progress must take concerted action. He said that only the initiative and active action of the broad masses of the people can change the balance of power in the country and open the way to establishing a new majority. Francesco Martino, Deputy Secretary of the Italian Socialist Party, congratulated the Congress on behalf of the Socialist Party. He said that in the difficult years of the "Cold War," Communists and Socialists had worked together for peace and international security. We do not abandon the steps we have taken together on this road. He added, to the warm applause of the delegates to the Congress, "We want to say 'no' to the anti-communist movement."

    Delegations from the fraternal Communist Parties of the Soviet Union, China, and France delivered congratulatory messages to the Congress. Their speeches were warmly welcomed by the Congress.

    The Congress divided into various committees to continue the meeting on the evening of the 1st.

Xinhua News Agency, Rome, February 2nd, TASS dispatch: Suslov, head of the delegation of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, read out the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the Ninth Congress of the Communist Party of Italy at the Ninth Congress of the Communist Party of Italy on January 31.

    The congratulatory message first extended warm, fraternal greetings to the Ninth Congress of the Communist Party of Italy and to all Italian Communists.

    The congratulatory message said that as the vanguard of the Italian working class and the Italian working people, the Italian Communist Party has gone through a long and glorious road of struggle for a better future and for the happiness of the Italian people. It bravely and uncompromisingly defends the interests of the working class and all working people, and holds high the banner of peace, democracy, and socialism.

    Struggling for the unity of the working class has always been an extremely important task for Italian Communists. Due to their unremitting activities, the Italian working class, based on its many years of experience, is increasingly convinced that the unity of the working class and the alliance with the peasants are the decisive conditions for achieving victory in the struggle to defend the interests of all working people.

    The congratulatory message said: Today, when socialism is showing its superiority over capitalism more and more convincingly, and when the great ideals of socialism have captured the hearts of tens of millions of people in all countries of the world, the Italian Communist Party is faced with new and favorable conditions to unite the majority of people around the working class, act in unison, resist the atrocities of monopoly capitalists, and strive for the democratic renewal of the country. The successful resolution of this task will open up broader prospects for the struggle to establish the most humane and just social system—socialism.

    The congratulatory message said that your party has strengthened the unity of its ranks and strengthened its influence among the masses of the people after smashing the attacks of the revisionists and their attempts to distort the great doctrine of Marxism-Leninism and split the workers' movement. Your party regards the unwavering struggle against revisionism, the main danger to the workers' movement and the communist movement, as well as against dogmatism and sectarianism, and the strengthening of ties with the masses and the strengthening of the confidence of the working class and working peasants as the guarantee of its new achievements.

    The Italian Communist Party has consistently carried out an active struggle to defend peace and oppose the arms race. The Italian Communist Party has expressed the peaceful aspirations of the Italian people, calling on and uniting the domestic forces of peace to fight for the elimination of the "Cold War" and to strive to transform the emerging relaxation of international tension into a lasting peace between all peoples.

    Long live the international solidarity of the working people in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism!

    意共代表大会讨论陶里亚蒂报告
    苏中法等国兄弟党代表向大会致贺词
    新华社2日讯　罗马消息：意大利共产党第九次代表大会在1月31日和2月1日讨论了党的总书记陶里亚蒂向大会作的报告：“争取意大利社会的民主革新，争取向社会主义前进”。
    意共政治局委员贾恩卡洛·巴叶塔在发言中谈到了意大利政治中的中心问题，即争取建立新的、能贯彻社会民主革新纲领的多数派的问题。他说，这个问题之所以产生，是因为天主教民主党、自由党、共和党和社会民主党组成的旧的多数派已经破产，而且谁也不想恢复这个多数派；另一方面，天主教民主党、保皇党和新法西斯分子组成的目前的多数派则经历着危机。
    巴叶塔强调说，共产党对意大利通往社会主义的道路问题，不能只局限于在理论上进行探讨，具有决定性意义的是群众斗争。
    巴叶塔接着说，天主教民主党在西西里企图建立包括社会党人而排斥共产党人的区域性的新的多数派的尝试失败了。天主教民主党之所以碰壁，是因为它要在新的形势下奉行歧视和反共的老政策。巴叶塔指出，新的多数派应该有我们参加，这不仅是正当的，而且是必需的、不可或缺的。他说，要排斥七百万投共产党的票的选民，并同另外几百万不答应反共的意大利人背道而驰来建立新的反共的多数派，这是决计办不到的。
    都灵“兰查”汽车制造厂的工人皮埃罗·莫洛在发言中说，把工人的努力同全体劳动人民和一切具有民主要求的意大利人的努力联合起来，就可以建立广泛的反法西斯战线，这条战线能堵塞种族主义和纳粹主义复活的道路，不让历史重演。
    党的领导机构成员维利奥·斯巴诺在发言中阐述了国际问题。他说，为了保证国际紧张局势的真正缓和，必须彻底战胜“冷战”鼓吹者。必须像苏联政府首脑赫鲁晓夫在联合国大会会议上提议的那样实现全面彻底裁军。
    斯巴诺接着说，苏联给其他国家树立了榜样，裁减了自己武装部队三分之一，意大利应当效法。斯巴诺接着建议通过声援阿尔及利亚人民的决议，这个建议在代表大会长时间的欢呼声中获得通过。
    共产党副总书记路易吉·隆哥在长篇发言中指出，争取缓和国际局势的力量是强大的，但是执意反对缓和的集团的势力也不能忽视。他强调指出，必须了解，无论在国际上还是在国内，仍然存在着相当大的反对缓和的势力。他说，紧张局势的缓和过程不会自行到来的。
    在谈到国内问题时，隆哥说，为了实现民主，一切和平和进步的力量必须采取一致的行动。他说，只有广大人民群众的主动精神和积极行动，才能改变国内力量的对比关系，才能开辟道路来建立新的多数。意大利社会党副书记弗朗切斯科·马蒂诺代表社会党祝贺代表大会。他说，在“冷战”的苦难年代里，共产党人和社会党人曾经一道致力于和平和国际安全。我们不背弃我们曾经一起在这条道路迈出的步骤。他在代表大会代表的亲切的掌声中补充说，我们要对反共产主义运动的人说一声：“不”。
    苏联、中国和法国等兄弟共产党的代表团向大会致了贺词。他们的讲话受到大会的热烈欢迎。
    代表大会在1日晚上分成各个委员会继续开会。
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社罗马1日讯：苏联共产党代表团团长苏斯洛夫1月31日在意大利共产党第九次代表大会上宣读了苏联共产党中央委员会致意大利共产党第九次代表大会的贺词。
    贺词首先向意大利共产党第九次代表大会和全体意大利共产党员致热烈的、兄弟般的问候。
    贺词说，作为意大利工人阶级和意大利劳动人民的先锋队，意大利共产党经历了为争取美好的未来，争取意大利人民幸福而斗争的漫长而光荣的道路。它勇敢地、不妥协地捍卫工人阶级和所有劳动人民的利益，高举和平、民主和社会主义的旗帜。
    为争取工人阶级的团结而斗争，这永远是意大利共产党人的极其重要的任务。由于他们的不懈的活动，意大利工人阶级根据自己多年来的经验，越来越相信，工人阶级的队伍的团结一致以及同农民的联盟，是在保卫所有劳动人民利益的斗争中取得胜利的决定性条件。
    贺词说：今天，当社会主义一天比一天令人信服地显示出它对资本主义的优越性，当社会主义的伟大理想已经掌握了世界各国千千万万人的心的时候，在意大利共产党的面前出现了新的有利的条件来把大多数人团结在工人阶级的周围，一致行动，反击垄断资本家的暴行，争取国家的民主革新。这一任务的顺利解决，将为争取建立一个最人道和最正义的社会制度——社会主义的斗争，打开更广泛的前景。
    贺词说，你们的党在粉碎了修正主义分子的进攻以及他们歪曲马克思列宁主义的伟大学说、分裂工人运动的企图以后，加强了自己队伍的团结，加强了在人民群众中的影响。你们的党把对工人运动和共产主义运动的主要危险修正主义以及对教条主义和宗派主义的始终不渝的斗争，把加强同群众的联系、加强工人阶级和劳动农民的信心，看作是自己获得新成就的保证。
    意大利共产党一贯为保卫和平，反对军备竞赛进行积极斗争。意大利共产党表达了意大利人民的和平愿望，它号召和团结国内的和平力量，为消除“冷战”而斗争，争取把出现的国际紧张局势的缓和变成各国人民之间的持久和平。
    劳动人民在争取和平、民主和社会主义斗争中的国际团结万岁！
