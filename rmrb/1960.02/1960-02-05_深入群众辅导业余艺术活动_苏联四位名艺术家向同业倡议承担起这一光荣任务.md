Deepen Among the Masses to Guide Amateur Art Activities
Four Famous Soviet Artists Advocate to Colleagues to Undertake This Glorious Task

    In order to actively contribute to the construction of communist culture, four famous Soviet artists, People's Actors Gogoleva, Popov, Smirnov, and musician Khachaturian, recently published an open letter in "Labor News," advocating that national professional art groups and artists actively undertake the glorious task of guiding mass amateur art activities.
    Gogoleva and others suggested that every theater, song and dance troupe, band, music school, drama school, and organization of composers and artists in every city across the country should undertake the obligation of guiding a mass art group. It is necessary to help the members of these amateur art groups to conduct rigorous and systematic study, and artists and talented young art workers should regard individual guidance to amateur art enthusiasts as their social obligation.
    In the open letter, these artists first enthusiastically pointed out how happy it is to be aware that our motherland is advancing towards communism at a great pace, and to be aware that they are builders of this beautiful society. A series of new and unprecedented relationships between people are becoming the basic principles of our lives. The initiative of socialist labor hero Gaganova in helping backward production teams improve is a shining example. The value and significance of Gaganova's action lies in her high level of consciousness. Therefore, people in factories, mines, and construction sites are following her example.
    Subsequently, these artists listed many exemplary deeds made by the Soviet intelligentsia in the letter: A group of medical workers in Rostov-on-Don proposed the initiative of treating patients during their spare time. In accordance with the spirit of this initiative, professors and teachers of higher technical schools proposed to go deep into the workshops and help workers in production on the spot, and many educators also proposed to use their rest time to help residents improve their culture.
    The open letter stated that art workers should participate in the great march towards communist culture. Although it is not a new issue for Soviet artists to guide mass art activities, this kind of connection needs to be more widely developed now. Any of us professional art workers can help the masses to carry out artistic activities according to our own strength.
    While publishing the artists' initiative, "Labor News" also published an article. The article said that Soviet amateur art activities are developing rapidly on an unprecedented scale. At present, there are 216,000 amateur groups of drama, music, chorus and dance nationwide, and there are as many as four million enthusiastic participants in these activities. Now, there is no club or enterprise without its own amateur art organization. Here, there is an extremely broad field of activity for professional artists.
    The article believes that artists have played a good role in guiding mass art activities in the past, and the initiative put forward by Gogoleva and others to regard guiding mass art activities as the artists' own obligation will surely be warmly responded to by artists across the country.

    深入群众辅导业余艺术活动
    苏联四位名艺术家向同业倡议承担起这一光荣任务
    为了在共产主义文化建设中积极贡献力量，苏联著名艺术家、人民演员戈戈列娃、帕波夫、斯米尔诺夫和音乐家哈恰图良等四人，最近在“劳动报”发表公开信，向全国专业艺术团体和艺术家倡议积极承担起辅导群众业余艺术活动的光荣任务。
    戈戈列娃等建议，全国各城市的每一个剧院、歌舞团、乐队、音乐学校、戏剧学校以及作曲家和美术家的组织，都为一个群众艺术团体承担起辅导的义务。要帮助这些业余艺术团体的成员进行严格、系统的学习，艺术家和有天才的青年艺术工作者应当把对业余艺术活动爱好者的个别辅导视为自己的社会义务。
    这几位艺术家在公开信中首先热情地指出，我们的祖国正在以巨大的步伐向共产主义前进，意识到自己是这个美好社会的建设者，该是一件多么幸福的事。一系列新的、前所未有的人与人之间的关系正在成为我们生活的基本原则。社会主义劳动英雄加干诺娃帮助落后生产队提高的创举是一个光辉的榜样。加干诺娃这一行动的价值和意义就在于，她具有高度的觉悟。因此，在工厂、矿山、工地的人们都效法她的榜样。
    接着，这几位艺术家在信中又列举了许多苏联知识界所作出的模范事迹：顿河上的罗斯托夫的一群医务工作者提出了利用工余时间为病人治病的倡议。根据这一倡议的精神，高等技术学校的教授和教师们提出要深入车间、就地帮助工人生产，很多教育工作者也提出要利用休息时间帮助居民提高文化。
    公开信中说，艺术工作者应当参加向共产主义文化的大进军。苏联艺术家辅导群众艺术活动虽然早已不是新提出的问题，但现在这种联系需要获得更广泛的发展。我们专业艺术工作者中任何一人都有可能根据自己的力量去帮助群众进行艺术活动。
    “劳动报”在刊载艺术家们的这个倡议的同时，发表了一篇文章。文章说，苏联业余艺术活动正在以从未有过的规模迅速发展。目前全国已有二十一万六千个戏剧、音乐、合唱和舞蹈的业余团体，这些活动的热情参加者已经有四百万之多。现在，没有一个俱乐部和企业中没有自己的业余艺术组织。在这里有专业艺术家们极广阔的活动领域。
    文章认为，过去艺术家们在辅导群众艺术活动中起了良好的作用，戈戈列娃等提出的把辅导群众艺术活动视为艺术家自身义务的倡议，必将得到全国艺术家们的热烈响应。
