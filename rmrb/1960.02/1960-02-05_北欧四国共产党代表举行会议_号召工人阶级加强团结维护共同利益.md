Xinhua News Agency, Oslo, February 2nd: Representatives of the Communist Parties of Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and Norway held a meeting in Oslo on January 30th and 31st to discuss the current international situation and issues related to these countries.

The communique issued after the meeting welcomed the upcoming summit conference.

The communique also stated that it must be ensured that the Scandinavian countries are a region free of missiles and nuclear weapons. The Scandinavian countries themselves must take measures to reduce the military burden.

The communique also pointed out the danger of West German militarism and demanded strong action against Nazi and anti-Semitic atrocities.

The communique called for the Scandinavian countries to establish normal relations with the German Democratic Republic.

Referring to the issue of some Scandinavian countries joining the small West European "free trade zone," the communique said that the West European "Common Market" and "Free Trade Association" are tools for large monopoly groups to plunder the national economies of certain countries and will lead to economic warfare, trade wars, and a reduction in the living standards of the people of the Scandinavian countries.

The Communist Parties of the Scandinavian countries have seriously warned their countries against joining such trade blocs. The communique advocated that the Scandinavian countries expand trade with all other countries.

The communique concluded by calling on the working class to strengthen unity and unite all democratic forces to take joint action to fight for common demands and interests.
