    At the Foot of Jigong Mountain
    Zhou Ming
    The Jigong Mountain People's Commune is located in the southern part of Xinyang County, with a warm climate and abundant rainfall. Countless small streams flow through the gullies, with water flowing all year round. In the past, apart from irrigating rice paddies, the remaining water flowed away unused.
    Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the vast number of cadres and masses of the Jigong Mountain People's Commune, while vigorously developing steel and striving for agricultural bumper harvests, launched a high tide of hydropower construction. In a very short period of time, three hydropower stations, eleven hydraulic processing factories, and many small hydraulic stations were built on these countless streams. The water that used to flow away unused began to be used to replace the heavy physical labor of the commune members. After nightfall, the lights shone brightly like countless stars on and around Jigong Mountain, bringing great convenience to people's production and life. Jigong Mountain began to move towards the road of electrification.
    At the Red Flag Hydropower Station
    The Jigong Mountain People's Commune Management Committee is located in Li Jiazhai Town. The Li Jiazhai River flows behind the town, and the Red Flag Hydropower Station is built on the riverbank behind the town.
    The power station's plant has five rooms, with red-tiled and blue-brick walls, which are very beautiful. Water flows from the aqueduct, impacting the wooden turbine with a rushing sound, rotating continuously. The turbine then drives the generator to rotate, generating electricity.
    There are very few management personnel at the power station, only one young man watching the machines. Comrade Tao Zikun, the person in charge of the hydropower station, told me: The regular flow of the Red Flag Hydropower Station is 0.5 cubic meters per second, and the power generation is 9 kilowatts. The electricity generated is supplied to factories for production during the day, and to more than 600 households of organs, enterprises, schools, and residents in the town for lighting at night. He said that although this power station is small, people simply cannot do without it now. Last year, there was a bumper harvest of rice, and the grain was urgently processed for transport. The rice hullers and rice milling machines installed here were relied upon for processing, and they can process more than 20,000 kilograms of rice every day. The processing fee is only 6 jiao per 100 kilograms, which is low and efficient.
    Busy Processing at the Foot of Jigong Mountain
    Coming to the foot of Jigong Mountain, I visited the hydraulic processing factory of the Xin Dian Production Team, which was the first to be built during the vigorous tool reform. A wooden turbine dragged a belt, and the belt drove two rollers, a winnowing fan, a rice milling machine, and a small steel mill. Several tools were spinning rapidly, making different booming sounds.
    Factory Director Zhan Jinyou told me: The hydraulic processing factory can not only mill rice and flour, but also thresh grain and fluff cotton. They use the turbine to drive the thresher, threshing more than 50,000 kilograms a day, regardless of whether it is cloudy or raining. Driving the cotton gin and the cotton fluffing machine can increase production efficiency by more than ten times. A double-person pedal-powered cotton fluffing machine can only fluff more than 20 kilograms of cotton a day, but using a turbine, it can fluff 300 kilograms of cotton day and night. It can also drive blowers and process feed... Whatever machine you install, it will do the work for you.
    After a trip to the foot of Jigong Mountain, I was fascinated by the water flowing all over the mountains and fields. What a great benefit it would be to utilize a stream, to let it generate electricity, to turn it into water energy! Build stations where there is water, generate electricity if possible, and build hydraulic stations first if electricity cannot be generated. This is to guide rural production to gradually embark on the broad road of mechanization and electrification. Take the Red Flag Power Station as an example, the total cost of building the station was only 3,500 yuan, and after the power station was put into production, the income from grain alone was 120 yuan per day, which could recover the entire investment in one month. If a hydraulic station is built first, there is no need to worry about not being able to turn it into a power station in a short period of time.

    在鸡公山下
    周明
    鸡公山人民公社在信阳县南部，气候温暖，雨量充沛，各个山冲里有数不清的小河沟，水流经年不断。以往，除了灌溉稻田外，其余的水流都白白地流走了。
    1958年大跃进以来，鸡公山人民公社的广大干部群众，在全民大办钢铁和争取农业丰收的同时，掀起了水电建设高潮。在很短的时间内，就在这无数的溪流上，建立了三座水电站，十一座水力加工厂和许多小型的水力站。从前白白流掉的水流，开始被用来代替社员们繁重的体力劳动。入夜以后，鸡公山上下繁星万点，电灯大放光明，给人民的生产与生活带来了极大的便利，鸡公山开始向电气化的道路迈进。
    在红旗水电站
    鸡公山人民公社管理委员会设在李家寨镇。李家寨河从镇子的背后流过去，红旗水电站就建设在镇后的河边上。
    水电站的厂房共有五间，红瓦青砖墙，很美观，水从引水渠里流过来，冲击着木制水轮机哗哗作响，不停地旋转，水轮机再带动发电机转动，发出电来。
    发电站的管理人员很少，只有一个小青年在看机器。水电站的负责人陶子坤同志告诉我：红旗水电站的经常流量是零点五秒立方米，发电量是九个瓩，发出的电能白天供给工厂生产，夜晚供给全镇机关、企业、学校和居民共六百多户照明。他说，别看这个电站小，现在人们简直一刻也离不开它了。去年水稻丰收，粮食急着加工外运，就靠这里安装了砻谷机和打米机来加工，每天能加工稻谷两万多斤，每一百斤的加工费只收六角钱，收费低，效率高。
    鸡公山下加工忙
    来到鸡公山脚下，我访问了新店生产队水力加工厂，这是大搞工具改革的时候最先建起来的。木制水轮机拖着一根皮带，皮带带动着两盘擂子，一个风车，一个打米机，一个小钢磨，几件工具飞快地转动着，发出高低不同的轰轰声。
    厂长詹金友告诉我：水力加工厂不光能打米磨面，还能脱谷弹花。他们用水轮机带上脱谷机，一天脱粒五万多斤，不管天阴下雨都能干，带动轧花机，弹花机，生产效率能提高十几倍，双人踩的弹花机，一天只能弹花二十多斤，用水轮机带，一天一夜就能弹花三百斤。还能带鼓风机、加工饲料……。安上什么机器，它就给你干什么活。
    在鸡公山下走了一遭，这漫山漫地的流水真叫人着了迷。一条水流利用起来，让它发电，让它变成水能，该有多大的好处！有水就建站，能发电就发电，不能发电先建水力站，这是引导农村生产逐步走上机械化、电气化的坦途。就以红旗电站为例吧，建站总共只花了三千五百元，而电站投入生产后，仅粮食一项每天收入一百二十元，一个月工夫就可以收回全部投资。如果先办的是水力站，也不愁不能在短短的时间内把它变成电力站。
