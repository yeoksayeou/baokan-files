Spring Light is Limitless: Preparations for Spring Ploughing Begin Early

    Guizhou: Major Farm Tool Reform, Accelerated Promotion
    Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, February 9th: People's communes throughout Guizhou Province are actively reforming and promoting various high-efficiency farm tools to welcome spring planting.
    Guizhou Province's spring sowing area will be larger this year than last year, and the quality of cultivation will be higher, but labor seems insufficient. In response to this situation, all parts of the province have put forward the slogan "Ask for labor and time from high-efficiency tools," rationally arranged labor, and accelerated the creation, imitation, and promotion of complete sets of new-style farm tools most urgently needed for plowing, soil breaking, fertilizer transportation, sowing, and transplanting.
    In their work, local party committee secretaries took personal command, established and improved tool reform institutions, trained a large number of technicians, and organized farm tool factory and machinery factory workers to fully invest in this work. In the past month, Huishui County's communes have improved and promoted more than 33,000 pieces of deep plowing, transportation, and sowing tools, increasing efficiency by one to five times compared to the original. Zhengan County adopted the method of returning iron, bamboo, and wood "three craftsmen" to the team and having a dedicated person in charge, rushing to produce more than 540,000 farm tools in more than half a month, of which more than 60% are improved farm tools, which can basically guarantee the needs of spring plowing. Tongren Prefecture, which started earlier, had already completed plowing all 660,000 mu of winter fallow land by the end of January, of which more than 90% was deeply plowed to more than nine inches. Bijie Prefecture, where the soil is relatively barren, has innovated tools for transporting fertilizer, turning soil, and preparing land, increasing efficiency by about one time. By early February, the entire prefecture had improved more than 3 million mu of soil, more than twice the original plan.
    Hubei: Accumulating and Manufacturing Fertilizer, Storing Water and Preparing Fields
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 9th: Preparations for spring ploughing are underway in Hubei.
    In the preparation for spring ploughing, the focus is on accumulating fertilizer, driving the adjustment and processing of seeds, and storing water and preparing fields. At present, about half of the 6.6 billion dan of base fertilizer needed for spring crops in Xiangyang, Wuhan, Jingzhou, Yidu, and other regions has been prepared. Yichang, Yunmeng, Qichun, Hanyang, Jianli, and other counties have basically prepared enough fertilizer for spring sowing. All kinds of tools needed for spring plowing and sowing are being repaired and added. Xiangyang Prefecture has promoted more than 50 kinds of standardized advanced transportation tools, totaling more than 870,000 pieces; 2,077 production teams have achieved an average of one vehicle for every two laborers. Counties, communes, and production teams in Wuhan, Jingzhou, Huanggang, and other regions have cooperated with each other to adjust seeds by more than 660 million jin.
    Adhering to the guiding principle of taking grain as the key link and achieving overall leap forward in agricultural production, and organizing the masses to widely discuss this year's production plan, is the biggest feature of Hubei Province's preparations for spring ploughing this year. Recently, many regions in Hubei Province have carried out large-scale debates on production planning measures in production teams, which has effectively promoted the preparation for spring ploughing.
    Jiangxi: Improving Soil and Preparing Sufficient Fine Varieties
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, February 8th: From south to north, from mountainous areas to plains, Jiangxi Province's preparations for spring ploughing are in full swing, progressing rapidly. In the warmer southern Jiangxi region, more than 150,000 mu of seedling fields have been prepared and are ready for sowing.
    This year, Jiangxi's preparations for spring ploughing fully implement the policy of taking grain as the key link, comprehensively developing multiple economies, and combining multiple harvests with high-yield harvests. Combining water conservancy construction, soil improvement, and the transformation of low-yield fields, various regions have adopted methods such as "converting dry land to paddy fields," "converting one season to two seasons," and reclaiming wasteland to actively expand the planting area. The province plans to expand the planting area by one million mu, and by the end of January, 400,000 mu of wasteland has been reclaimed. By the end of January, 93.3% of the province's water conservancy construction tasks have been completed, and many projects have achieved reservoir completion and canal connection, which can be used for irrigation during spring ploughing. The province's fertilizer accumulation front is also accelerating forward. Recently, the province has built more than 100,000 collective pig farms. By February 2nd, the accumulated farm manure averaged 470 dan per mu of cultivated land. In addition, a large amount of local fertilizer was produced. Various regions have widely carried out a fertilizer delivery tool reform movement.
    Most regions have established rice transplanter manufacturing committees, and more than 40 counties have established agricultural tool research institutes or agricultural machinery offices. Each commune has established an agricultural technology innovation leading group. In order not to delay the farming season, various regions have mobilized forces to rush to manufacture rice transplanters day and night. By the end of January, the province had produced more than 1,500 59-type rice transplanters and repaired and added 2,712,200 various small farm tools.
    All prefectures, counties, and people's communes in the province have established seed management institutions. At present, the province's seed preparation work is basically ready, and the area of fine varieties can reach more than 95%.
    Hebei: Harrowing to Conserve Moisture, Early Rice Seedling Cultivation
    Xinhua News Agency: This year, Hebei Province's preparations for spring ploughing have been moved forward by two solar terms compared to previous years. At present, the southern region is carrying out intensive spring irrigation, harrowing to conserve moisture, identifying seeds, and preparing for the sowing of early-maturing crops. Under the slogan of "Seize a bumper harvest, accelerate preparations for spring ploughing," many communes have already started greenhouse seedling cultivation of sweet potatoes and cotton. In low-lying rice paddy areas, based on the experience of continuous great leaps forward, rice seedlings are being cultivated early. Each production team has drawn out labor to form specialized seedling cultivation teams, preparing fields, spreading fertilizer, and adding wind tents. Chengde Prefecture, outside the Great Wall, is carrying out basic construction of high-yield ditches, high-yield riverbanks, high-yield slopes, and large areas of terraces, according to the mountainous characteristics. Due to the large-scale fertilizer accumulation movement in this prefecture, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu of spring-sown land has increased by about 50% compared to last year. In the past, the grassland on the dam was cultivated extensively and preparations for spring ploughing were late, but this year, activities started here when it was still freezing and snowy.
    This year, the characteristics of Hebei Province's preparations for spring ploughing are early start, large scale, and rapid progress. To date, the province has prepared and planned 42.4 million mu of land. Handan, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, and other regions with earlier seasons have completed and overfulfilled the land preparation plan. In the week after the Spring Festival, various regions accumulated and manufactured more than 115 billion jin of fertilizer, delivered more than 110 billion jin of fertilizer, and drilled more than 700 machine wells, achieving a red start to spring. The maintenance and manufacturing of farm tools in various regions is also underway.
    Inner Mongolia: Ice Road Fertilizer Transport, Doubling Efficiency
    This newspaper reports: Many communes in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have promoted ice road fertilizer transport in their preparations for spring ploughing, greatly accelerating the speed of fertilizer delivery to the fields.
    Recently, in Hulunbuir League, Jerim League, and Zhaowuda League in the eastern part of the autonomous region, the temperature has dropped to about minus 20 degrees Celsius, and the rivers are frozen, which is a good opportunity to use ice roads for transportation. Around the Spring Festival, Mongolian and Han members of four people's communes in the suburbs of Tongliao City used the Xiliao River and artificial irrigation methods to build five ice roads totaling more than 3,400 meters in length, dispatching large numbers of sleds to transport manure fertilizer back and forth. On the 300 kilometers of ice roads recently opened in Zhalantun Banner, Aohan Banner, and other places, tens of thousands of sleds and frozen soil vehicles are active, stepping up the transportation of manure fertilizer and earthwork to the fields and water conservancy construction sites.
    The Party committees of Liangcheng County and Zhuozi County in Ulanqab League attached great importance to ice road transportation. After deeply mobilizing the masses to offer suggestions and work hard, they have built 28 natural and artificial ice roads, totaling 17 kilometers in length.
    According to local experience, the use of ice road transportation has many advantages, not only high transport efficiency and fast speed, saving manpower and animal power, but also simple manufacturing of ice road transportation tools, low cost, and easy for women and children to master.

    春光无限好  备耕工作早
    贵州：大改农具　加速推广
    据新华社贵阳9日电　贵州省各地人民公社正在积极改革和推广各种高工效农具，迎接春耕播种。
    贵州省今年春播面积比去年扩大，耕作质量要求更高，但劳力显得不足。针对这一情况，全省各地提出了“向高工效工具要劳力，要时间”的口号，合理安排劳力，加速创制、仿造和推广犁田、碎土、运肥、播种、插秧等方面最迫切需要的成套新式农具。
    在工作中，各地党委书记亲自挂帅，建立和健全了工具改革机构，训练大批技术人员，组织农具厂、机械厂职工全力投入这一工作。惠水县各公社一个月来，已改良和推广了三万三千多件深耕、运输和播种工具，使工效比原来分别提高了一倍到五倍。正安县采取铁、竹、木“三匠”归队，专人领导的办法，在半个多月中赶制了各种农具五十四万多件，其中60％以上是改良农具，基本上能保证春耕需要。动手较早的铜仁专区，六十六万亩冬闲土地已在1月下旬全部翻犁完毕，其中90％以上深耕九寸以上。土壤较瘠瘦的毕节专区，革新了运肥、翻土、整地等方面的工具，工效提高一倍左右，到2月上旬，全专区已改良土壤三百多万亩，超过原计划一倍多。
    湖北：积制肥料　蓄水整田
    据新华社武汉9日电　湖北各地的备耕工作正在紧张进行。
    各地在备耕中以积肥为中心，带动调剂、处理种子和蓄水、整田等工作。现在，襄阳、武汉、荆州、宜都等地区春播作物所需的六十六亿担底肥，已经备好一半左右。宜昌、云梦、蕲春、汉阳、监利等县已经基本备足春播用肥。春耕春播所需的各种工具，各地都在加紧整修和添置。襄阳专区已推广各种定型的先进运输工具五十多种共八十七万多件；有二千零七十七个生产队达到了平均每两个劳动力有一部车子。武汉、荆州、黄冈等地区的县与县、公社与公社、生产队与生产队之间展开协作，互相调剂种子达六亿六千多万斤。
    坚持以粮为纲全面跃进的农业生产方针，组织群众广泛讨论今年的生产规划，是湖北省今年备耕工作的最大特色。最近以来，湖北省许多地区都以生产队为单位，开展了生产规划措施的大辩论，有效地推动了春耕准备工作。
    江西：改良土壤备足良种
    据新华社南昌8日电  江西省从南到北，从山区到平原，备耕工作热气腾腾，进展很快，气候较暖的赣南地区，已经做好秧田十五万多亩，准备播种。
    今年江西各地备耕工作全面贯彻了以粮为纲全面发展多种经济和多种多收与高产多收相结合的方针。各地结合兴修水利、改良土壤、改造低产田等工作，采取了“旱地改水田”、“一季改双季”和开荒等办法，积极扩大播种面积。全省计划扩大播种面积一百万亩，到1月底已开垦荒地四十万亩。全省水利兴修任务到1月底已完成93．3％，而且许多工程做到了库成渠通，春耕时即可引水灌溉。全省积肥战线也加速向前推进，最近期间，全省共兴建集体养猪场十万多个。积攒的农家肥，到2月2日止平均每亩耕地已有四百七十担。此外，还生产了大量的土化肥。各地广泛开展了送肥工具改革运动。
    大部地区都成立了插秧机制造委员会，有四十多个县成立了农具研究所或农业机械处，各公社都成立了农业技术革新领导小组，为了不误农时，各地调集力量，日夜突击制造插秧机，到1月底，全省已制成五九型插秧机一千五百多部，修理和添置各种小农具二百七十一万二千多件。
    全省各专区、县、人民公社都成立了种子管理机构。目前全省种子准备工作已基本就绪，良种面积可达95％以上。
    河北：耙地保墒　提前育秧
    据新华社讯　河北省今年的备耕工作比往年提前了两个节气。目前南部地区正在突击春灌、耙地保墒、鉴定籽种和准备早熟作物播种，在“夺取大丰收、备耕往前赶”的口号下，不少公社已经开始了甘薯和棉花温室温床育苗工作。低洼稻田地区，已根据连年大跃进的经验，提前育秧，各生产队都抽出劳力组成育秧专业队，边整田、边铺肥、边加风帐。长城外的承德专区，根据多山的特点，正大搞丰产沟、丰产川、丰产坡和大片梯田的基本建设。这个专区由于大搞积肥运动，每亩春播地的施肥量，已比去年增加了50％左右。坝上草原历年耕作粗放、备耕较晚，但今年这里在冰天雪地的时候就开始了备耕活动。
    今年，河北省备耕工作的特点是动手早、规模大、进度快。到目前止，全省整地、划方已达四千二百多万亩。季节较早的邯郸、石家庄、保定等地区，已经完成和超额完成了整地计划。各地在春节后的一周内，就积肥、造肥一千一百五十多亿斤，送肥一千一百多亿斤，打成机井七百多眼，实现了开春红。各地的农具检修和制造工作也在紧张进行。
    内蒙古：冰道运肥　工效倍增
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区许多公社，在备耕工作中推广冰道运肥，大大加快了田间送肥速度。
    自治区东部呼伦贝尔盟、哲里木盟和昭乌达盟，近来气温下降到摄氏零下二十度左右，河水封冻，正是利用冰道运输的良好时机。春节前后，通辽市郊区四个人民公社的蒙、汉族社员，利用西辽河和人工浇灌方法，修筑起五条长达三千四百多米的冰道，出动大批爬犁往返穿梭地运送粪肥。扎赉特旗、敖汉旗等地最近开辟的三百公里冰道上，活跃着成千上万台爬犁、冻土车，加紧向田间和水利工地运送粪肥和土石方。
    乌兰察布盟凉城县、卓资县党委对冰道运输十分重视，经过深入发动群众出谋划策，苦干巧干，已建成自然冰道和人工冰道二十八条，共长十七公里。
    根据各地经验，利用冰道运输优点很多，不仅运效高，运速快，节省人力畜力，而且冰道运输工具制造简便，造价低，妇女儿童都能掌握。
