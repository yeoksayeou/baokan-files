Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou -- Since September of last year, rainfall has been scarce in Guangdong, and water storage has generally decreased. This year's spring planting is earlier than in previous years, and the planting area has also expanded, greatly increasing the demand for water. Therefore, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Party committees at all levels regard storing and conserving water as one of the important measures to ensure early spring planting. Many areas have adopted effective measures to do this work well.

First, various regions inspected the water storage situation in reservoirs and ponds, vigorously sought out underground water sources, and accelerated the construction of canals to divert water for irrigation for newly completed or soon-to-be-completed water conservancy projects. Many areas lacking water sources have adopted the method of blocking rivers to impound and conserve water through crash programs.

    广东蓄水保水迎春播
    缺乏水源地区封江堵河引水灌田
    据新华社广州电　广东各地自去年9月以来，降雨量很少，蓄水量普遍减少，而今年春播比往年提早，种植面积又比往年扩大，需水量也大大增加。因此，中共广东省委和各级党委都把蓄水保水作为当前保证提早春播的重要措施之一。许多地区为了做好这一工作，采取了一些有效措施。
    各地首先检查了山塘、水库的蓄水情况，大力找寻地下水源，对于新完成或即将完成的水利工程加快开渠、引水灌田。许多缺乏水源的地区，则用封江堵河的办法突击蓄水保水。
