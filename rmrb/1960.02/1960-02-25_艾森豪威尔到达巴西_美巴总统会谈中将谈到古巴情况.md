Xinhua News Agency, Brasilia, 24th. U.S. President Eisenhower arrived in Brasilia, the future capital of Brazil which is under construction, on the 23rd by plane from Puerto Rico.

An hour before Eisenhower's arrival in Brasilia, a joint statement by Eisenhower and Brazilian President Kubitschek was released. It is reported that this joint statement was drafted in advance in exchanges between the two presidents and foreign ministries. The statement expressed the desire to make "all countries within the Pan-American group work together more closely and in a coordinated manner" to "overcome the underdeveloped state of the Americas."

The statement emphasized the need to "fully implement the principles in the Charter of the Organization of American States and the Rio de Janeiro Mutual Assistance Treaty."

According to a United Press International reporter on the 23rd, the implication of this joint statement, originating from the U.S. Ramey Air Force Base in Puerto Rico where Eisenhower spent the night, is: "to demand Pan-American cooperation to deal with communism." This is the well-known euphemism used by the United States to refer to the Latin American national independence movement.

According to United Press International, Eisenhower's preparations for this visit were painstakingly thorough. The report said that this trip to South America was "prepared as carefully as his visit to eleven Asian, European and African countries last December, and perhaps even more carefully." "The speeches he will deliver in the parliaments of the four countries he will visit have been prepared for a long time," and even when spending the night in Puerto Rico, Eisenhower and Herter and members of the National Advisory Committee on Inter-American Affairs "studied these speech drafts one by one."

Eisenhower began talks with Kubitschek on the evening of the 23rd. Prior to this, Kubitschek said at a press conference held in Brasilia that in the next three days of talks, he intends to present Eisenhower with concrete suggestions for implementing the Pan-American Action Plan he has advocated.

According to United Press International, the two presidents will also frankly discuss the Castro regime in Cuba and the current tense relationship between Cuba and the United States.

    艾森豪威尔到达巴西
    美巴总统会谈中将谈到古巴情况
    新华社24日讯　巴西利亚消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔23日由波多黎各乘飞机到达正在建设中的巴西未来首都巴西利亚。
    在艾森豪威尔到达巴西利亚前一小时发表了艾森豪威尔同巴西总统库比契克的联合声明。据报道，这篇联合声明是事先在两国总统和外交部的换文中起草的。声明中表示要使“泛美集团内的所有国家愈来愈紧密和协调地共同努力”来“克服美洲大陆不发达状况”。
    声明强调要“充分实施美洲国家组织宪章和里约热内卢互助条约”中的原则。
    据合众国际社记者23日从波多黎各艾森豪威尔过夜的美国鲁梅空军基地发出的消息说，这篇联合声明的含意是：“要求泛美合作来对付共产主义”。这是人所共知的美国用来称呼拉丁美洲民族独立运动的代名词。
    据合众国际社透露，艾森豪威尔对这次访问的准备进行得煞费苦心。消息说，这次南美之行“准备得同他在去年12月对亚欧非十一国的访问一样仔细，甚至可能更加仔细。”“对他将在访问的四国的议会中发表的演说都作了长时间的准备”，甚至在波多黎各过夜的时候，艾森豪威尔还同赫脱和泛美事务全国顾问委员会的委员们“逐一研究了这些演说草稿”。
    艾森豪威尔在23日晚上开始和库比契克举行会谈。在这以前，库比契克在巴西利亚举行的一次记者招待会上说，在以后三天的会谈中，他打算向艾森豪威尔提出履行他所倡议的泛美行动计划的具体建议。
    据合众国际社报道，两国总统还要开诚布公地谈论古巴的卡斯特罗政权，以及古巴目前和美国之间的紧张关系。
