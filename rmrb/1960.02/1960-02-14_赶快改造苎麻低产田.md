    Hasten the Transformation of Low-Yield Ramie Fields
    Ramie is a raw material for the textile industry and several heavy and light industries. The fishery and civilian needs for ramie are also very large. Therefore, vigorously increasing ramie production is of great significance for supporting the country's socialist construction, increasing farmers' income, and improving people's lives. There are two ways to increase ramie production: actively developing new ramie land, and taking effective measures to increase the yield per unit area of existing old ramie land.
    Among the existing old ramie lands, some have low yields due to the excessive age of the rootstocks, sparse planting, poor drainage, and pest and disease damage, which hinder the growth of ramie plants. Such low-yield ramie fields exist everywhere. According to typical surveys in various regions, low-yield ramie fields generally account for about 30% of the total ramie area. In individual places, it even accounts for 50% of the total ramie field area, with yields three to four times lower than normal ramie fields. Therefore, transforming low-yield ramie fields into high-yield ramie fields is the most important link in tapping the potential for increased production from existing old ramie fields.
    How to transform low-yield ramie fields? First of all, for old fields with many missing clumps, sparse planting, or severe "clump failure," replanting should be carried out. Replanting old ramie fields is best done in early spring. After replanting, each mu should have about 2,000 clumps. In Yihua Commune, Yuanjiang County, Hunan Province, yields were 120 jin per mu with more than 900 clumps, and 420 jin per mu with more than 2,000 clumps. This shows that increasing the number of clumps can multiply the yield.
    Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen the cultivation and management of old ramie fields, and thoroughly change its low-yield appearance through measures such as deep digging, more fertilizer, diligent cultivation, and re-covering with grass. The Dongkou Production Team of Sanyantang Commune, Yuanjiang County, Hunan Province, has a low-yield old ramie field, which has been rejuvenated by taking measures such as deep digging between rows, storing manure in winter, increasing the soil layer, and covering with lake grass. The annual yield per mu has reached 200 to 300 jin.
    Paying attention to drainage in ramie fields, preventing underground pests, preventing "clump failure," vigorously developing wind and drought prevention equipment, and old-to-new renewal are also effective measures to transform low-yield ramie fields.
    It is now near the beginning of spring, which is a great time to transform low-yield ramie fields. If low-yield ramie fields can be completely turned around, this year's ramie production will take a bigger leap forward.

    赶快改造苎麻低产田
    苎麻是纺织工业和若干重工业、轻工业的原料。渔业、民用需要苎麻的数量也很大。因此，大力增产苎麻，对支援国家社会主义建设，增加农民收益，改善人民生活，都有重大意义。增产苎麻途径有二，即积极发展新麻地；采取有效措施，提高现有老麻地单位面积产量。
    现有老麻地中，有一部分或者由于宿根年代过久，或者由于栽得过稀和因排水不良以及病虫为害等原因使麻株生长不良，产量不高。这种低产麻田各地都有，据各地典型调查，低产麻田一般约占苎麻总面积的30％左右。个别地方甚至占麻田总面积50％，比正常麻田产量低三、四倍。因此，改造低产麻田，变低产麻田为高产麻田，是挖掘现有老麻田增产潜力最重要的一环。
    怎样改造低产麻田呢？首先对老龄缺蔸很多，或栽植过稀以及“败蔸”严重的麻地，要进行补蔸。对老麻田的补蔸，最好在初春进行。补蔸后，每亩要求达到二千蔸左右为宜。湖南沅江县彝华公社每亩九百多蔸的，亩产一百二十斤，二千多蔸的，亩产四百二十斤。由此可见，蔸数增加，产量才能成倍增长。
    其次，是加强老麻田的培育管理，通过深挖、多肥、勤耕、复草等措施，彻底改变它的低产面貌。湖南沅江三眼塘公社洞口生产队，有一块低产老龄麻地，由于采取行间深挖、窖冬粪、增厚土层，覆盖湖草等措施，得到复壮，常年亩产达到二、三百斤。
    注意麻地排水，防治地下害虫，防止“败蔸”，大搞防风防旱设备和挖老更新等，也都是改造低产麻田的有效措施。
    目前已近春初，正是改造低产麻田的大好时机。如果低产麻田都能大翻身，今年苎麻生产的跃进步子就会更大。
