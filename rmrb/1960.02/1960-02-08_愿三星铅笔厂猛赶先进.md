    Wishing Samsung Pencil Factory to Vigorously Catch Up with the Advanced
    I am a member of the People's Liberation Army Air Force. We often use a special type of mapping pencil with five colors: red, blue, black, green, and yellow.

    This type of pencil is produced by two brother factories: the jointly owned state-private Samsung Pencil Factory and the jointly owned state-private China Pencil Company Factory No. 2, but the product quality differs greatly. The pencils produced by the Samsung Pencil Factory break easily when sharpened, the writing is unclear, and the thickness is uneven; the pencils produced by China Pencil Company Factory No. 2 are easy to sharpen, easy to write with, and the lines can be drawn very evenly and beautifully. Why is the quality so different for the same type of pencil? I hope that they can be on par in 1960. Zhao Guiyang

    愿三星铅笔厂猛赶先进
    我是人民解放军空军人员。我们经常使用一种有红、蓝、黑、绿、黄五色的标图特种铅笔。
    这种铅笔是公私合营三星铅笔厂和公私合营中国铅笔公司二厂两个兄弟厂生产的，但产品质量相差很远。三星铅笔厂生产的铅笔，很容易削断，笔迹不清，粗细也不匀；中国铅笔公司二厂生产的铅笔好削，好写，线条可以划得非常匀，而且美观。同是一种类型的铅笔，为什么质量相差这么远？希望在1960年中能并驾齐驱。　赵桂扬
