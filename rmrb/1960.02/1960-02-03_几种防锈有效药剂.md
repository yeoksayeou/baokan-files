Several Effective Rust Preventatives

    1. Lime Sulfur Mixture: Use two catties of sulfur, mix with one catty of quicklime, add fifteen catties of water, boil over high heat until reddish-brown, pour out and filter. Use a Baumé hydrometer to measure the concentration, then add water to dilute to 0.5 degrees. Use to spray wheat. It has good effects on stripe rust, leaf rust, and stem rust.
    2. Colloidal Sulfur: (Using waste molasses or paper pulp waste liquid as a dispersant): Dilute with 200 to 300 times water and spray. The effect is similar to lime sulfur mixture.
    3. Polysulfide: Dilute with 100 times water and spray. The effect is good. The agent must be stored in a dry, sealed container to prevent it from losing its effectiveness.
    4. Tea Cake: Boil or cold soak one catty of tea cake with ten catties of water. After boiling, remove the residue, add enough water, and spray.
    5. Lycoris Radiata: Boil one catty of Lycoris Radiata with ten catties of water and spray.
    6. Ailanthus Altissima Bark: Boil one catty with ten catties of water and spray.
    7. Mixture of Lime Sulfur Mixture: Use 0.3-degree lime sulfur mixture mixed with tea cake water, cat's eye, wolfsbane, Lycoris Radiata, soybean stalks, and other local pesticides in a ratio of 1:10.
    8. 3% Ammonium Sulfate Water: Has a killing effect on stripe rust urediniospores and also has a fertilizer effect. However, it should be discontinued after heading to avoid drug damage.
    9. Zineb: Spray 500 times the solution, which has a good effect on the three types of rust.
    10. Dinosam: Using 0.5% solution can also control leaf rust, stem rust, and scab, but the effect on stripe rust is poor.

    几种防锈有效药剂
    1、石灰硫磺合剂：用二斤硫磺，混合一斤生石灰，加十五斤水，用烈火熬煮至棕红色，倒出过滤，用波美比重计测定浓度，再加水稀释至零点五度，用以喷布小麦。对条锈病、叶锈病、秆锈病都有良好效果。
    2、胶体硫：（废糖蜜或纸浆废液作分散剂）：用二百至三百倍水稀释后喷布，效果与石灰硫磺合剂近似。
    3、多硫化：用一百倍水稀释后喷布，效果良好。药剂必须保存在干燥密闭容器里，以免失效。
    4、茶饼：一斤茶饼加十斤水熬煮或冷浸，熬后去其渣，补足水，即可喷布。
    5、石蒜：一斤石蒜加十斤水熬煮后喷布。
    6、臭椿树皮：一斤加水十斤熬煮后喷布。
    7、石灰硫磺合剂的混合剂：用零点三度石灰硫磺合剂与一比十的茶饼水、猫儿眼、狼毒、石蒜、豆秸等土农药混用，混合比例为一比一。
    8、3％硫铵水：对条锈菌孢子堆有杀伤作用，并兼有肥效作用。但在抽穗后要停止使用，以免发生药害。
    9、代森锌：喷布五百倍液，对三种锈病有良好效果。
    10、二硝散：用0．5％药液可兼治叶锈病、秆锈病及赤霉病，对条锈病效果较差。
