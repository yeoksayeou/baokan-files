Cultivate Green Manure Like Growing Crops

Li Xin'ge, First Secretary of the CPC Changde County Committee

Planting green manure is very common in Changde County. Over the past ten years, the area planted with green manure has grown from 1% of the fields to 90%. In 1960, the county planted 950,000 mu of green manure, accounting for 86.9% of the paddy field area, an expansion of 50% compared to 1959 and more than double that of 1958. This has laid a preliminary foundation for the continued leap forward in agricultural production this year. After analysis, the county party committee promptly proposed a plan to strengthen field management and strive to achieve a green manure yield of 10,000 jin per mu this year.

After a winter of cultivation and management, the green manure is growing well, with large areas of full and vigorous seedlings. According to the recent assessment, there are 200,000 mu of *lanhua* (a type of hairy vetch), of which special-class seedlings account for 28.5%, first-class seedlings account for 34.4%, second-class seedlings account for 26.6%, and third-class seedlings account for only 0.5%. There are more than 400,000 mu of *honghua* (a type of milk vetch), of which special-class seedlings account for 33.2%, first-class seedlings account for 22.8%, second-class seedlings account for 33.2%, and third-class seedlings account for 10.8%. The county party committee requires further processing and cultivation on the basis of the existing good growth, with *honghua* reaching a yield of 15,000 jin per mu and *lanhua* reaching 10,000 jin per mu.

In 1959, among the more than 600,000 mu of green manure planted in our county, 110,000 mu yielded over 10,000 jin. We have summarized the experience of high-yield production of 10,000 jin and initially grasped the production characteristics of green manure crops: "likes warmth, loves dryness, tolerates cold, fears waterlogging, and fears drought." The growth rate has two peaks and one trough: it grows faster from autumn sowing to before the cold winter, which is the first peak; it grows slowly in the cold winter, which is the trough; and it grows rapidly in the spring, which is the higher peak. Therefore, after the green manure was sown last year, the county party committee put forward the slogan: "Seize the first peak, attack the second peak." Our specific method to achieve this slogan is to promote "three earlies, three additions, and one thorough" based on years of management experience. "Three earlies" means: early sowing, early ditching, and early topdressing; "three additions" means: add "seedling fertilizer" in autumn, add "warming fertilizer" in winter, and add "spring promoting fertilizer" in spring; "one thorough" means: ditching and drainage must be thorough. Last winter and this spring, in the field management of green manure crops, in addition to first focusing on early sowing and full seedlings, we also focused on the following three key points:

First, ditching and drainage. Green manure is a biennial leguminous plant that loves dryness and relies on parasitic rhizobia to produce nutrients. Bacterial activity requires air. If there is too much water in the soil and less air, it will affect bacterial activity, which is not conducive to growth and easily leads to diseases. Therefore, ditching and drainage are necessary. When the field water freezes in winter, it isolates the air. Once the temperature becomes warm, the green manure is prone to die. There is more rain in spring, so ditching and drainage should be done especially. Therefore, whether the ditching and drainage of green manure fields are thorough is an important key to high-yield green manure. The so-called thoroughness specifically requires: early digging, deep digging, and frequent dredging. The county has been vigorously opening "water-following ditches" since last autumn, so that all ditches are connected and water drains away after rain.

Second, seize the opportunity to topdress. Although the rhizobia parasitizing on the roots of milk vetch have the function of absorbing free nitrogen in the air, the root system is not developed and there are few bacteria in the seedling stage. At the same time, bacterial life must also absorb nutrients from the soil. Generally speaking, the nutrients in the soil are not enough to cultivate the full growth of milk vetch, or they are not easily decomposed and absorbed for a while. Therefore, it is necessary to apply sufficient base fertilizer first, and then topdress in stages. We have mastered three periods in topdressing: one is the autumn seedling stage, adding one or two "seedling fertilizers"; the second is to add "warming fertilizer" once from "Beginning of Winter" to "Minor Snow"; now the county has entered the third period of topdressing, that is, around the "Beginning of Spring", seize the sunny days, and vigorously add quick-acting fertilizer and phosphate fertilizer, which is called "spring promoting fertilizer". "Spring promoting fertilizer" should be added early, and not wait until the wind is warm and the sun is shining to start. Because no matter what fertilizer is added, it takes a period of time to decompose before it can be absorbed by the crop. Add fertilizer early, decompose early, and if the weather is windy and sunny, the green manure crops will grow rapidly. Each time you add fertilizer, you should add some phosphate fertilizer, because the general phosphorus content in the soil is low, and milk vetch has a strong ability to absorb phosphorus, and using phosphorus to nourish nitrogen is the most effective, and it can also increase the phosphorus content in green manure.

Third, make good preparations for animal power and ensure timely plowing. The peak growth period of green manure is from "Vernal Equinox" to "Pure Brightness," growing more than two inches a day. Green manure cannot be plowed too early, but it cannot be old seedlings either. "Too tender, a layer of water," the fertilizer effect is not high; "too old, a handful of slag," it is not easy to rot. When is the right time? The local people's experience is: "Milk vetch plowed in full bloom" "Hairy vetch plowed at first bloom." The full bloom period of green manure is short, so preparations should be made early. Generally, one head of draft animal should be responsible for twelve mu of green manure field.

Our county has successfully passed the first stage and the first peak in green manure production. All ditches have been opened, fertilizer has been added one to three times, and the growth is generally good. Now farmers across the county are seizing sunny days and vigorously adding quick-acting fertilizer. At the same time, drainage ditches are frequently checked and dredged to ensure that all ditches are unobstructed and each ridge drains. And prepare sufficient cattle power, adhere to timely plowing.

Now, the slogan "Strive to achieve a county with 10,000 jin of green manure per mu" resounds in every corner, and everywhere you can see people cultivating green manure like growing crops.

    像培育庄稼一样培育绿肥
    中共常德县委第一书记　李新革
    常德县种绿肥很普遍。十年来由1％的田种绿肥发展到90％的田种绿肥。1960年度全县种植绿肥九十五万亩，占水田面积的86．9％，比1959年度的种植面积扩大了50％，比1958年度增加了一倍多。这就初步奠定了今年农业生产继续跃进的肥料基础。县委经过分析，及时提出了加强田间管理，力争今年实现绿肥亩产万斤的计划。
    经过一冬的培育管理，绿肥生长良好，大面积的苗全盛旺。根据最近的摸底排队，蓝花（苕子之一种）二十万亩，其中特类苗占28．5％，一类苗占34．4％，二类苗占26．6％，三类苗只占0．5％。红花（紫云英之一种）四十多万亩，其中特类苗占33．2％，一类苗占22．8％，二类苗占33．2％，三类苗占10．8％。县委要求在现有生长良好的基础上再加工培育，红花达到亩产一万五千斤、蓝花达到亩产一万斤。
    我县1959年度种的六十多万亩绿肥中，有十一万亩在万斤以上。我们总结万斤丰产经验，初步掌握到绿肥作物的生产特性是：“喜温暖，爱干燥，耐寒冷，怕渍淹，怕干旱”。生长速度是二个高潮一个低潮：从秋播到寒冬前长的较快，是第一个高潮；寒冬长的慢，是低潮；开春长的猛，是更高潮。因此，县委在去年绿肥下种以后，就提出了：“抢住第一高潮，猛攻第二高潮”的口号。我们实现这个口号的具体办法，就是根据历年管理的经验，提倡“三早、三追、一彻底”。“三早”即：早播种、早开沟、早追肥；“三追”即：秋季追“提苗肥”，冬季追“保温肥”，开春追“催春肥”；“一彻底”即：开沟排水必须彻底。去冬今春，在绿肥作物田间管理工作中，我们除了首先抓好早播全苗以外，还认真抓了以下三关：
    第一，开沟排水。绿肥是隔年生豆科植物，爱干燥，依靠寄生的根瘤菌制造养分。细菌活动需要空气，如土壤中水分过多，空气少了，就影响细菌的活动，不利于生长，且易带来病症，因此要开沟排水。冬季田水结冰，隔绝了空气，一遇气温变热，绿肥便容易死亡。春季雨水多，尤应开沟排水。因此绿肥田开沟排水是否彻底，是绿肥丰产的重要关键。所谓彻底，具体要求是：开的早、挖的深、勤疏通。全县从去秋开始，大开“顺水开沟”，已作到沟沟相通，雨停水干。
    第二，抓紧追肥。苦草子根部寄生的根瘤菌虽然有吸取空中游离氮的作用，但在幼苗期根系不发达，细菌少，同时细菌的生活也必须从土壤中吸取养分。一般来说土壤中的养分不够培养草子充分生长，或一时不易分解被吸收，因此既要首先施足底肥，又要分期追肥。我们在追肥中掌握了三个时期：一是秋季幼苗期，追一、二次“提苗肥”；二是在“立冬”到“小雪”追一次“保温肥”；现在全县已进入追肥第三个时期，即在“立春”前后，抓住晴天，猛追速效肥和磷肥，这叫“催春肥”。“催春肥”应早追，不能等到风和日暖才动手。因为无论什么肥料追下去后，都要有一段时间分解才能被作物吸收。早追肥，早分解，遇上风和日暖的天气，绿肥作物即迅速猛长。每次追肥均应追些磷肥，因土壤中一般的含磷少，而草子吸磷能力很强，以磷养氮见效最快，而且能使绿肥中增加含磷的成分。
    第三，作好畜力准备，保证适时翻沃。绿肥生长最盛期在“春分”至“清明”，一天长二寸多。绿肥不能过早沃，但也不能老苗。“过嫩一铺水”，肥效不高；“过老一把渣”，不易腐烂。何时才叫适时呢？本地群众的经验是：“草子沃盛花”“苕子沃头花”。绿肥盛花期短，应早作准备，一般一头耕畜以负担十二亩绿肥田为宜。
    我县绿肥生产上的第一关和第一个高潮已经胜利渡过，全部开好了沟，追肥一到三次，普遍生长良好。现在全县农民正抢晴天，猛追速效肥。同时，排水沟勤检查、勤疏通，保证沟沟畅通，垅垅排水。并备足牛力，坚持适时翻沃。
    现在，“力争实现绿肥万斤县”的口号响遍每个角落，处处可以看到人们像培育庄稼一样培育绿肥。
