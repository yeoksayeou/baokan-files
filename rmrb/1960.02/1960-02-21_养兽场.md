Traveling from Jilin to Changchun, the route is filled with undulating hills. Countless solitary small ridges are scattered across the hilly terrain, forming a natural landscape of mountains embracing mountains in circles.

Our train stopped at a small station. In the twilight, we saw countless lights twinkling on the distant hillside, resembling stars in the sky. A comrade traveling with me told me: This is our destination – the Jilin Special Products Research Institute.

We hurriedly got off the train. Stepping on the newly laid frozen dirt road, we walked towards the direction of the starry sky.

“The Northeast has three treasures: ginseng, mink fur, and Ula grass. Actually, Ula grass can hardly be considered a treasure anymore. The real treasures are ginseng, mink fur, and deer antler. The main production areas for these precious goods are still in Jilin, Northeast,” Vice Director Lu of the Research Institute enthusiastically introduced Jilin's special products and their tasks.

He said that special product research is a new type of undertaking in our country, a cause with significant economic and political importance. Unfortunately, the data left over from old China is too scarce, requiring us to explore and improve from scratch in production practice.

The Research Institute's animal farm is located on the hillside behind the office. Crossing the small earth slope, there are several small dilapidated thatched huts. In front of the huts, there are several fences made of branches. Inside the fences are rows of wire cages. Here, there are silver foxes with black fur covering white guard hairs, Arctic foxes with thick blue and snow-white down, minks with glossy fur and full down, nutria with fine fur, and raccoon dogs from the Northeast with thick fur. These wild animals, except for nutria and raccoon dogs which can eat a small amount of meat or no meat, are all carnivores.

While we were visiting and discussing breeding conditions, Vice Director Lu said that the breeding situation here is very good. Silver foxes average more than five pups per year, and Arctic foxes average about eleven. Nutria are originally suitable for living in areas with a mild climate, clear water, and lush grass, but now, after acclimatization, they also live very well in the colder climate of the north. Last year, one nutria had thirteen pups, setting a national record for high yield. Raccoon dogs also breed quickly. It seems that nutria and raccoon dogs have great development prospects. First, they don't need to eat meat; second, they breed quickly, and can be skinned in five or six months; third, they can be raised in groups in enclosures; fourth, many places have the conditions for breeding them.

The most interesting animals in the animal farm were the sable. There are more than one hundred sable here, all captured from Changbai Mountain. The abundant pine nuts on Changbai Mountain are the best food for squirrels, and a large number of squirrels are the natural food for sable. These domesticated sable have relatively docile temperaments and are raised well, unlike when they were first captured, when they were restless and frightened. Currently, the issue that needs to be researched is reproduction. It is said that sable usually take two to three years to breed because the female sable is very sensitive to the external environment. If there is too much fear and stimulation, it will not be easy for them to conceive. Now, they have organized a sable taming team to go deep into the Changbai Mountain area, ready to capture, raise, and breed them on the spot. It is expected that the breeding results will be much better under conditions where environmental changes are minimal.

We also visited the deer enclosure in the animal farm, which was located on a hillside five miles away. When we crossed several earth slopes to reach there, a deer herder rode a horse and drove the deer herd back from grazing on the hillside. Vice Director Lu picked up a bean stalk and waved it at the deer herd. Immediately, the large and small deer herds moved towards the place where the bean stalk was waving. There was no sign of fear or apprehension. We unanimously praised their success in taming them. Because the successful free-range grazing of the deer herd opened up a broad path for the expansion of the deer herd's reproduction and large-scale breeding.

The Jilin Special Products Research Institute is a new type of scientific research department and also a very large-scale experimental farm. Unfortunately, the animal farm we saw was only a part of the Research Institute; we did not see all of it. Nevertheless, it left a very deep impression on me: all of our country's special products and precious wild fur-bearing animals will no longer be left to fend for themselves, but will grow and develop according to people's will. Now, some places have already seen some "Thousand Chicken Mountains" and "Ten Thousand Chicken Mountains." I think that one day, many places will have artificially raised "Ten Thousand Fox Mountains," "Ten Thousand Mink Mountains," and "Ten Thousand Raccoon Dog Mountains"...

    养兽场
    静宇
    吉林到长春，沿途是波浪起伏的丘陵，无数的孤独的小山脊纵横散列在丘陵地带，形成了一圈又一圈的群山环抱的天然景色。
    我们的列车在一个小站上停住了。暮色苍茫中，看到远处山坡上闪烁着无数的灯光，恰似天边的繁星。同行的同志告诉我：这就是我们的目的地——吉林特产研究所到了。
    我们匆忙地下了车。踏着新铺的冰冻土块大路，朝着半天繁星的方向走去。
    “东北有三宝，人参、貂皮、乌拉草。其实，乌拉草早就算不上什么宝贝了。真正的宝贝还是人参、貂皮和鹿茸。这些宝货的主要产地还是东北的吉林。”研究所的吕副所长热忱地向我们介绍了吉林特产和他们的任务。
    他说，特产研究在我们的国家是一个新型的事业，是一项具有重大的经济意义和政治意义的事业；可惜旧中国遗留下来的资料太少了，需要我们在生产实践中从头摸索，研究提高。
    研究所的养兽场设在办公室的后山坡上。翻过小小的土坡，就是几间破小的茅舍，茅舍的前面，有几处用树枝围插起来的篱笆。篱笆里边排列着许多铁丝笼。这里，有全身黑毛复盖白色毛针的银黑狐，有蓝色和雪白色绒毛丰厚的北极狐。有色泽光润，绒毛丰满的水貂，有毛绒细密的海狸鼠，还有毛绒丰厚的东北貉子。这些野兽，除了海狸鼠和貉子可以吃少量的肉或者不吃肉以外，其余都是肉食兽。
    我们一边参观一边谈论繁殖情况，吕副所长说，这里的繁殖情况很好。银狐平均每年产仔五头多，北极狐平均约产十一头。海狸鼠本来是适宜于气候温和、水清草肥地带生活的，现在经过风土驯化，在北方较冷的气候条件，也生活得很好。去年有一头海狸鼠产仔十三个，创全国高产纪录。貉子繁殖也很快。看起来海狸鼠和貉子大有发展前途。第一，不要吃肉；第二，繁殖又快，五、六个月就可以打皮；第三，可以群放圈养；第四，很多地方都有饲养条件。
    养兽场里最引起我们兴趣的还是紫貂。这里共有一百多头紫貂，都是从长白山上捉来的。长白山上的大量松子是松鼠的最好饲料，而大批松鼠又是紫貂的天然饲料。这些驯养的紫貂性情比较纯和，饲养情况很好，不像刚捉来的时候那样不安和惊恐。目前，需要研究的是繁殖问题。据说，紫貂通常要有两年到三年才能繁殖，因为母貂对外界环境非常敏感，如果惊恐和刺激较大，就不容易受精怀胎。现在，他们已经组织了紫貂驯育队深入长白山区，准备就地捕捉，就地饲养，就地繁殖。预计在环境情况改变较少的条件下，繁殖效果会好得多。
    我们还参观了养兽场的鹿圈，鹿圈设在五里以外的山坡里。当我们翻越了几个土坡到达那里的时候，一个驯鹿的同志骑大马赶着鹿群从山坡上放牧回来。吕副所长拣起一根豆秸，向鹿群摆动，立即大小鹿群朝向豆秸摆动的地方走来。一点也没有惊恐畏惧的神色。我们一致称颂他们驯服的成功。因为，鹿群的散放成功，对于鹿群的扩大繁殖和大量饲养辟开了宽阔大道。
    吉林特产研究所是个新型的科学研究部门，又是一个规模很大的实验场。可惜，我们看到的养兽场，只是研究所的一个部分，没有看到它的全部。尽管如此，它却给我留下了极深刻的印象：我国的一切特产和一切珍贵野牲皮毛兽将不是自生自灭，而是要按照人们的意志发展生长了。现在，有些地方已经出现了一些千鸡山、万鸡山，我想，总有一天，有不少的地方将会出现人工驯养的万狐山、万貂山、万貉山……。
