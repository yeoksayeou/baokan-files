Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 10th: The Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Akahata," published an editorial today regarding Kishi Nobusuke's response in the Diet, stating that the Kishi Nobusuke government absolutely cannot conceal the aggressive nature of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

In his Diet replies on the 8th and 9th, Kishi Nobusuke, in order to muddle through, deliberately narrowed the scope of the "Far East region" referred to in the new "Security Treaty," saying that the Far East only includes the area north of the Philippines to the vicinity of Japan and the Kuril Islands. The editorial said that this response completely changed the statement made by Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama last year. Last November, Fujiyama publicly explained at the extraordinary session of the Japanese Diet that, according to the new "Security Treaty," the "Far East region" includes the area around Japan north of the Philippines, the Soviet Primorsky region, and the coastal areas of mainland China.

The editorial said that this proves that the Kishi Nobusuke government is deceiving the Japanese people with irresponsible statements.

The editorial continued that, since the new treaty is aggressive in nature, the Kishi Nobusuke government absolutely cannot conceal the essence of this treaty. Even if, as Kishi Nobusuke said in the Diet, the area to which the new treaty applies is limited to the area north of the Philippines, then the vast area including the Philippines, Taiwan, Okinawa, Japan, and South Korea will also be designated as the Japan-U.S. joint military activity area.

The editorial pointed out that these areas have a network of American military bases. How can the Japanese government convince the people that the strategic deployments in these areas are not aimed at the Soviet Union and China?

The editorial pointed out that designating the entire Kuril Islands region as an area to which the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" applies is an extremely important matter. The editorial said that the Kuril Islands are undoubtedly part of Soviet territory, and Japan renounced its territorial claims to these islands in the San Francisco Treaty; at the same time, this is also recognized by international agreements. The editorial pointed out that including the Kuril Islands in the area of Japan-U.S. joint military activities is clear evidence of the aggressive nature of the new treaty.

The editorial further pointed out that Taiwan is part of Chinese territory. Kishi Nobusuke's reply regarding the Far East region is equivalent to saying that Japan is planning to participate in the "counterattack against the mainland" war by the United States and Chiang Kai-shek's troops based in Taiwan. The editorial emphasized that nothing is more concrete than this aggressive plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 10th: The "Asahi Shimbun" published an editorial today warning that the Japanese people are seriously uneasy about the scope of the "Far East region" stipulated in the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama clearly stated at the extraordinary session of the Diet last November that the "Far East region" to which the new "Security Treaty" applies includes mainland China and the Soviet Primorsky region. These past two days, Kishi Nobusuke deliberately narrowed the interpretation of the scope of the Far East region in his Diet replies, attempting to muddle through during the Diet deliberations of this aggressive military treaty.

The "Asahi Shimbun" said that the fundamental reason for the Japanese people's unease is that the treaty uses the term Far East, which means areas other than Japan, and the treaty allows the United States military to take military action in the Far East region from Japan.

The editorial continued that peace in the Far East should become the goal of Japanese diplomacy.

An "Asahi Shimbun" columnist pointed out today that the Kishi Nobusuke government, in a dilemma, is now desperately trying to get out of its predicament by using sophistry and making bizarre explanations of the scope of the Far East region related to the treaty. It is surprising that the Japanese government is still unable to confirm the meaning of the terms in the treaty it signed itself.

According to the "Yomiuri Shimbun," the Kishi Nobusuke government, panicked by the confusion caused by the questioning, is now ordering the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to determine a unified opinion on the issue of the Far East region from a new perspective. However, the newspaper predicts that no matter how it is "corrected," Kishi Nobusuke's statement in the Diet will end up adding fuel to the fire on this issue.

Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) radio stated yesterday that the interpretation of the scope of the Far East region will become a central issue of discussion in the Diet in the future. During the Diet deliberations on the new "Security Treaty," considerable disputes are unavoidable.

    日共“赤旗报”斥岸信介关于“远东地区”范围的谬论
    日美军事同盟侵略矛头针对中苏
    “朝日新闻”指出远东的和平应成为日本外交的目标
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天就岸信介在国会所作的答辩发表社论说，岸信介政府想掩盖新日美“安全条约”的侵略本质是绝对办不到的。
    岸信介8、9两日在国会答辩时为了蒙混过关，故意缩小了新“安全条约”中指的“远东地区”的范围，他说远东只包括菲律宾以北到日本周围为止的地区和千岛群岛。社论说，这个答辩完全改变了日本外务相藤山爱一郎去年的说法。藤山去年11月在日本国会临时会议上曾经公开解释说，根据新“安全条约”，“远东地区”包括菲律宾以北的日本周围地区、苏联滨海地区和中国大陆的沿海地区。
    社论说，这证明岸信介政府在用不负责任的说法来欺骗日本人民。
    社论接着说，由于新条约具有侵略性质，岸信介政府要想掩盖这个条约的实质是绝对办不到的。即使真像岸信介在国会中所说，新条约所适用的地区限于菲律宾以北的地区，那末包括菲律宾、台湾、冲绳岛、日本和南朝鲜在内的广大地区，也将划在日美共同军事活动地区之内。
    社论指出，这些地区有美国的军事基地网。日本政府如何能使人民相信在这些地区的战略布置不是针对苏联和中国的呢？
    社论指出，把千岛群岛整个地区定为新日美“安全条约”适用地区，这是一件极为重大的事情。社论说，千岛群岛毫无疑问是苏联领土的一部分，在旧金山条约中日本放弃了对这些群岛的领土要求；同时这也是为国际协定所承认的。社论指出，把千岛群岛包括到日美共同军事活动的地区之内，是新条约的侵略性质的一个明显的证据。
    社论进一步指出，台湾是中国领土的一部分。岸信介关于远东地区的答辩等于说日本正在计划参加以台湾为基地的美国和蒋介石军队的“反攻大陆”的战争。社论强调说，没有任何东西比这个侵略计划更加具体的了。
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：“朝日新闻”今天发表社论警告说，日本人民对于新日美“安全条约”所规定的“远东地区”的范围感到严重不安。
    日本外务相藤山爱一郎去年11月在国会临时会议上曾经明确地说，适用新“安全条约”的“远东地区”包括中国大陆和苏联滨海地区。这两天，岸信介在国会答辩中又故意缩小关于远东地区范围的解释，企图在国会审议这项侵略性军事条约时蒙混过关。
    “朝日新闻”说，日本人民感到不安的根本原因是条约中使用了意味着日本以外其他地区的远东这个字样，条约容许美国军队从日本出发在远东地区采取军事行动。
    社论接着说，远东的和平应当成为日本外交的目标。
    “朝日新闻”专栏作家今天指出，进退两难的岸信介政府现在拼命想用诡辩和对条约中有关远东地区的范围作希奇古怪的解释的办法来摆脱困境。令人诧异的是日本政府对它自己签字的条约中的条款含义竟还不能肯定。
    据“读卖新闻”说，被质询造成的混乱情况弄得惊慌失措的岸信介政府，现在正命令外务省从新的角度出发确定关于远东地区这个问题的统一意见。可是报纸预料，不论怎样“更正”，岸信介政府在国会的发言，结果将给这个问题火上添油。
    日本广播协会电台昨天指出，关于远东地区的范围的解释，今后将在国会内成为议论的中心问题。在国会审议新“安全条约”时，避免不了要发生相当大的纠纷。
