Killing Two Birds with One Stone, Achieving Perfection
The Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics Runs Schools and Factories to Promote Scientific Research and Cultivate Technical Talents
    (Our Report) The Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has adopted the method of "one main, two auxiliary, and three combinations," taking scientific research as the center, vigorously developing education, and vigorously engaging in production. These activities support and promote each other, accelerating the cultivation of scientific and technical talents and promoting the development of scientific research.
    The Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics is a newly built research institute established in 1953. In recent years, the scientific research work of this institute has developed very rapidly. As the optics cause further leaps and bounds towards the highest peak of world optical science, it is necessary to cultivate a large number of optical precision machinery and instrument scientific and technical talents in a faster, better, and more economical way to meet the needs. However, due to the particularity of optical precision machinery research majors, fewer universities offer these majors. In the past, the number of university graduates sent to the institute by the state each year could not meet the needs of the rapid development of work. In particular, some university graduates, due to differences in their majors, had to go through a process of familiarization and learning for one or two years before they could begin to engage in research work after arriving at the institute. Faced with this situation, the Party Committee of the Institute decided, in accordance with the Party's education policy, to take the Institute as the main force, tap its potential, run schools, and run factories to vigorously cultivate scientific and technical talents, so that the main body has two wings, leaping towards the highest peak of science.
    Under the unified leadership and arrangement of the Party Committee, the institute's employees enthusiastically responded to the Party Committee's call to "run the institute as a college." After only three months of preparation, China's first Optical Precision Machinery College was established in the summer of 1958. The institute established this new type of college mainly by taking scientific research as the center and combining it with education. The director and deputy director of the institute concurrently serve as the president and vice president of the college. Researchers, associate researchers, assistant researchers, research trainees, etc., serve as professors, associate professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants in the college. The institute also transferred nearly fifty research personnel with a university degree or higher to the college to engage in full-time education. The departments and majors set up by the Optical Precision Machinery College are all adapted to the various research majors of the institute. The college's teaching plans, scientific research plans, and production labor are also discussed, studied, and formulated under the leadership of the institute's Party Committee, focusing on the institute's scientific research center. In classroom teaching, teachers combine the actual research work for explanation, and timely transmit the latest cutting-edge scientific research results to students. For example, in ordinary chemistry teaching, the teaching staff enriched the teaching content and improved the teaching quality by incorporating the new theories of rare earth optical glass and the new phenomena of chemical reactions in the technological process in the 1958 research results of the institute into the curriculum. The institute's factory also provided a place for productive labor. The college also obtained assistance from extensive cooperation with other universities and colleges to make up for its own shortcomings. In this way, this new type of polytechnic full-time university has a considerable scale and possesses excellent professors and good equipment. At the same time, with the rapid development of scientific research work, the institute also rapidly expanded into an experimental factory serving research. Technical schools and various training classes were also opened in the factory to cultivate and improve the technical level of workers. The Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics has established colleges and factories, coupled with the original staff amateur school, forming a joint base integrating research, education, and production, mainly engaged in the research of optical precision machinery and instruments.
    The Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics takes scientific research as the main task, runs colleges and factories, and combines the three, making theory and practice more closely linked, rapidly and comprehensively cultivating scientific and technical talents, and promoting the development of scientific research work. At present, more than 500 students are being trained in the Optical Precision Machinery College. Due to the superior conditions of the college, teaching can be more closely integrated with the actual scientific research, and the students trained can gradually meet the needs of the development of optical scientific research. For example, when students take mechanical drawing classes, they select representative optical instruments from the institute as surveying and mapping objects in large-scale assignments, training them in design and drafting skills, and also cultivating the advanced knowledge necessary for future work in this major. They also often participate in some technical design and drafting work and other scientific research work of the institute. Therefore, they can more effectively familiarize themselves with and gradually master the theoretical and practical knowledge of optical scientific research work in their studies. At present, this college has become an important auxiliary force for the scientific research work of the institute.
    Will the "three combinations" affect scientific research work? Practice has proved that it will not. The research personnel who are engaged in teaching have also improved their scientific level and promoted the development of research work because they have systematically consolidated and developed basic theoretical knowledge and professional knowledge in teaching. For example, when some researchers used to calculate friction phenomena in research work, they relied on old experience and forgot the theoretical basis. Now, because they are teaching basic courses in the college, they have reviewed the courses they learned more than 20 years ago and found the theoretical basis again. Research personnel go to factory workshops to conduct research work in conjunction with workers and technicians, imparting technical theories and helping them solve process problems, improving and cultivating their technical level; at the same time, through factory processing and trial production, research results are also tested, promoting the improvement of the level of research work. Due to the adoption of the "three combinations" approach, this institute, on the basis of completing the research work of eight major high-precision optical instruments and a series of new optical glass products in 1958, successfully researched and developed 40 high-precision optical instruments such as large electron microscopes in 1959, enabling the institute's research work to enter a new stage where it can independently design and manufacture high-precision optical instruments with originality.

    一举两得  三全其美
    光学精密机械仪器研究所办学校办工厂推动了科学研究培养了技术人材
    本报讯　中国科学院光学精密机械仪器研究所，采取“一主、二辅、三结合”的办法，以科学研究为中心，大办教育，大搞生产，互相支援，互相促进，加速了科学技术人材的培养，同时也推动了科学研究的发展。
    光学精密机械仪器研究所是1953年新建的研究所。几年来，这个研究所的科学研究工作发展十分迅速。光学事业在进一步向世界光学科学最高峰飞跃发展时，要求多快好省地培养大量光学精密机械仪器的科学技术人材，以适应需要。但是，由于光学精密机械研究专业所具的特殊性，各大学设置这些专业的较少，过去每年由国家输送到研究所的大学毕业生，还不能满足工作飞速发展的需要。尤其是有些大学毕业生由于所学专业的不同，来到研究所后，还要经过一、二年熟悉和学习的过程，才能开始从事研究工作。研究所党委面对这一情况，根据党的教育方针，决定以研究所为主要力量，挖掘潜力，办学校，办工厂，大力培养科学技术人材，使主体具有二翼，向科学最高峰跃进。
    在党委统一领导、统一安排下，研究所职工热烈响应党委所提“全所办学院”的号召，只经过三个多月的筹备，就在1958年暑期，建立起我国第一个光学精密机械学院。研究所建立这个新型的学院，主要是采取以科学研究为中心，结合办教育的办法。研究所的正、副所长，兼任学院的正、副院长，研究员、副研究员、助理研究员、研究实习员等，就在学院中担任教授、副教授、讲师和助教。研究所还抽调了将近五十名具有大学毕业以上水平的研究人员，到学院专职办学。光学精密机械学院设置的科系和专业，都和研究所的各个研究专业相适应。学院的教学计划、科学研究计划和生产劳动等，也都在研究所党委领导下，围绕着研究所的科学研究这一中心，进行讨论、研究和制订的。在课堂教学中，教师们结合着研究工作的实际进行讲解，及时把最新的尖端的科学研究成果，传授给学生。例如在普通化学教学时，教学人员把研究所1958年研究成果中的稀土光学玻璃新的理论和工艺过程中化学反应的新现象，充实到课程里去，丰富了教学内容，提高了教学质量。研究所的工厂也提供了生产劳动场所。学院还从和其他高等院校进行广泛协作中取得帮助，弥补自己的不足。这样，就使这个新型的理工性质的全日制高等学校具有相当规模，并且拥有优秀的教授和良好设备。与此同时，随着科学研究工作的迅速发展，研究所也迅速扩大为研究服务的实验工厂。在工厂中还开办了技工学校和各种训练班，培养提高工人的技术水平。光学精密机械仪器研究所办起了学院、工厂，加上原有的职工业余学校，就形成了一个以研究光学精密机械仪器为主的研究、教育、生产三结合的联合基地。
    光学精密机械仪器研究所以科学研究为主，办学院、工厂，三者结合的做法，使理论和实际更加紧密联系，迅速全面地培养了科学技术人材，促进了科学研究工作的发展。现在，光学精密机械学院中培养着五百多名学生。由于学院有优越条件使教学更密切结合科学研究实际，培养出来的学生可以逐渐满足光学科学研究发展的需要。比如学生上机械制图课，在大型作业中，就选择了研究所中具有代表性的光学仪器作为测绘对象，训练了他们设计制图技巧，也培养了将来从事本专业工作中必备的先进知识。他们也经常参加研究所某些技术设计制图工作和其他科学研究工作。因此，他们在学习中就能够更有效地熟悉和逐渐掌握光学科学研究工作的理论和实际知识。目前，这个学院就已经成为研究所科学研究工作的重要辅助力量。
    “三结合”会不会影响科学研究工作？实践证明是不会影响的。担任教学的研究人员，由于在教学中系统地巩固和发展了基础理论知识和专业知识，也提高了自己的科学水平，推动了研究工作的发展。比如有的研究人员在研究工作中作摩擦现象的计算时，过去都是凭老经验，忘记了理论根据。现在由于在学院中担任基础课教学，重新温习了二十多年前自己所学的课程，又找到了理论根据。研究人员下到工厂车间，同工人、技术员结合进行研究工作，为他们传授了技术理论和帮助解决工艺问题，提高和培养了他们技术水平；同时，通过工厂的加工试制，也检验了研究成果，促进了研究工作水平的提高。由于采取了“三结合”的作法，这个研究所在1958年完成八大件高精度光学仪器和一系列新产品光学玻璃的研究工作基础上，1959年又研究成功大型电子显微镜等四十件高精度光学仪器，使研究所研究工作进入了能够独立设计制造高精度并具有独创的光学仪器的新阶段。　（李得天）（附图片）
