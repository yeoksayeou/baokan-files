One Branch, Three Uses: Tea Leaves, Tea Seeds, and Cuttings Achieve Triple Harvest

    Under the correct leadership and support of the Party, cadres and the masses in the tea-producing areas of Yixing County, Jiangsu Province, have created the experience of “triple harvest of tea leaves, tea seeds, and cuttings.” Due to the creation and promotion of this experience, the county's tea production in 1959 increased by 1.3 times compared to 1958, tea seed production increased by 13%, and the branches used for short-shoot cuttings increased by 5.4 times.

    The fact that tea leaves, tea seeds, and cuttings achieve a triple harvest powerfully shattered the old concept that seed retention and high yield cannot be achieved simultaneously, and opened up a broader path for vigorously developing tea production and obtaining seedlings in the future.

    Achieving a triple harvest of tea leaves, tea seeds, and cuttings simultaneously is a new attempt. Yixing County achieved this by first conducting experiments and observations to basically grasp the laws of tea tree growth and development. In their observations, they discovered that tea trees can, according to their growth habits, achieve one branch with three uses: leaf picking, seed retention, and cuttings. When the branches grow to about one foot in length, the terminal buds, tender leaves, and "opposing leaves" are picked according to the standard of one bud and two leaves to make dried tea; the branches left on the tree continue to be cultivated for use as cuttings; when cutting the cuttings, two or three new leaves should be retained at the base of the branches to facilitate seed formation. This achieves the purpose of one branch with three uses.

    According to their experience, adopting this experience requires extra strengthening of fertilizer management of tea trees, including applying more base fertilizer and frequent top dressing.

    一枝三用　茶叶茶籽插穗三丰收
    江苏省宜兴县茶区的干部和群众，在党的正确领导和支持下，创造了“茶叶、茶籽、插穗三丰收”的经验。由于创造和推广了这个经验，1959年全县茶叶产量比1958年增加一点三倍，茶籽产量增加13％，插穗短穗扦插用的枝条增加五点四倍。
    茶叶、茶籽、插穗三丰收的事实，有力地打破了已往留种和丰产不能兼顾的陈旧观念，为今后大力发展茶叶生产取得种苗开辟了更加广阔的途径。
    同时取得茶叶、茶籽、插穗三丰收，是一项新的尝试。宜兴县实现茶叶、茶籽、插穗三丰收，首先是经过试验和观察，基本上掌握了茶树生长发育的规律。他们在观察中发现茶树可以按照它的生长习性，作到一枝三用——采叶、留种、插穗。当枝条生长到一尺左右的时候，按一芽二叶标准摘去顶芽、嫩叶和“对夹叶”制作干茶；留在树上的枝条继续培育供作插穗；在剪取插穗的时候，要保留枝条基部二、三片新叶，以利结籽。这样就达到了一枝三用的目的。
    根据他们的经验，采用这个经验，必须格外加强对茶树的肥培管理，要多施基肥，勤施追肥。
