The Zhuang, Han, and Maonan people, heroic men, work happily with smiles; the commune has built a power station, and lights hang all over the mountains. The commune members put on their ethnic costumes, like peacocks spreading their wings; dancing, singing heartily! Joyful songs fill the hills. Young people touch the light bulbs with their hands, old people shield their eyes and look up, children watch the lights and jump and shout, women look at the lights and grin. The mountain village night is like a heavenly palace in a fairy tale, with thousands of night-shining pearls sparkling, awakening the sleeping fields.

    公社建成发电站
    韦志彪僮、汉、毛难族的英雄汉，喜笑颜开干的欢；公社建成发电站，灯光点点挂满山。社员穿起了民族服装，像孔雀张开了翅膀；跳呀，纵情的歌唱呀！欢乐的歌声飘满山岗。青年用手摸着电灯泡，老人用手遮眼抬头瞧，儿童望着灯光跳又叫，妇女望着灯光咧嘴笑。山村之夜呵，像神话里的天宫，千万颗夜明珠在闪耀，把沉睡的田野照醒了。
