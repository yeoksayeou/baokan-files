Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 21st: U.S. authorities are calling Eisenhower's South American trip a "goodwill visit," and promoting it as "a demonstration of the U.S. changing its attitude towards Latin America." However, many U.S. press and political figures point out that the U.S. ruling class is panic-stricken by the rapidly deteriorating colonial rule in Latin America. Eisenhower is attempting to use this visit to try to curb the further development of anti-American struggles in Latin America.

    The "Evening Star" wrote on February 8th, using a blatant colonialist tone, that in the past, "for a long era," "the Pan-American world was, in the final analysis, the world of the United States," and "American power has always been unquestionable." However, the Castro regime in Cuba "is now showing that we (the United States) are very far from that simple old era. His welcome to Soviet visitor Mikoyan is one of the most prominent episodes in the history of this hemisphere," indicating that "the era of the United States controlling the hemisphere has passed."

    U.S. Senator Smathers, who has consistently advocated strong intervention in Latin American affairs, said in a speech on January 6th, "Latin America is undergoing a period of great shock and change," and "American interests have been deeply harmed, but we, in the United States, have almost lost the ability to influence the development of events." He hoped that Eisenhower's trip to Latin America "can provide us (the United States) with an effective opportunity" to "restore the prestige that the United States has lost there for many years."

    American journalist Joseph Newman published articles in the Argentine newspaper "Clarin" at the end of January and on February 19th, saying that Eisenhower wants to visit South America because he believes it is necessary to stop "the continued deterioration of the United States' position in Latin America." Eisenhower is particularly trying to seek "multilateral collective action" during the visit to impose "economic and political sanctions" on Cuba.

    The "Christian Science Monitor" published an editorial on January 7th entitled "Seeking a Stable Hemisphere." It said that Eisenhower's trip to South America is to engage in "extremely important patching-up work in the rear," and "Washington needs to show its friendship in these countries, especially if it does not want to face a repeat of the Cuban stalemate..."

    Despite Washington's repeated release of an atmosphere of "goodwill" and "friendship," some U.S. news agencies and newspapers have stated bluntly that the fundamental imperialist policy of the United States towards Latin America will not change. A United Press International report from Washington on February 9th said, "Few Washington diplomats believe" that Washington's policy toward Latin America will undergo "fundamental or significant changes immediately" after this presidential visit. The February 1st "U.S. News & World Report" admitted in an article about the visit that the people of Latin America generally hate the imperialist policies of the United States. It said that the United States has historically maintained U.S. rule and protected U.S. property through the Mexican War, the occupation of the Panama Canal Zone, and the landing of Marines in the Caribbean republics, "all of which have led people to often raise the familiar accusation of 'American imperialism.'" However, the magazine said that one of the purposes of Eisenhower's trip is to promote U.S. investment in Latin America. It said that "stimulating private investment" and "protecting American investment" are "fixed components of U.S. policy toward Latin America."

    Faced with the current situation of surging anti-American sentiment in Latin America, many U.S. newspapers are very worried about the reception Eisenhower's trip will receive. Columnist Lippmann wrote in the "Washington Post" on January 28th that Eisenhower's "visit will be more difficult than any he has made in the past, and the risks involved—the political risks—are very great." Lippmann pointed out that now "South America is full of resentment," and in the United States' "relations with Latin America, our (American) performance has always been to support the past and oppose the future. Now retribution has come. Anti-Americanism wins people's hearts, and anti-Americanism represents progress."

    美报透露艾森豪威尔南美之行的目的
    维护美国统治　遏阻反美斗争
    据新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：美国当局把艾森豪威尔的南美之行称作“亲善访问”，宣传“这是美国改变对拉丁美洲的态度的表现”，但是不少美国报界和政界人士指出，美国总统要进行这次匆促的访问，是由于美国统治集团对他们在拉丁美洲殖民统治地位急剧恶化惶恐不安，艾森豪威尔企图借助这次访问去竭力阻遏拉丁美洲反美斗争的进一步发展。
    “明星晚报”2月8日用一种露骨的殖民主义口吻写道，在过去“经历了很长的时代”里，“泛美世界归根究底是美国的世界”，“美国的权力一直是不容置疑的”，但是，古巴卡斯特罗政权“现在正在表明，我们（美国）距离那简单的旧岁月已经很远了。他对苏联访客米高扬所表示的欢迎，是本半球历史中最突出的片断之一”，表明“由美国掌管半球的时代已经过去了”。
    一贯鼓吹强硬干涉拉丁美洲事务的美国参议员斯马瑟斯1月6日发表谈话说，“拉丁美洲正经历着巨大震动和变化的时期”，“美国的利益已深深地受到侵害，但是我们，在美国，几乎已经丧失了影响事态发展的能力”。他希望艾森豪威尔这次拉丁美洲之行“能给我们
  （美国）提供一个有效的机会”，来“恢复许多年来美国已经在那里丧失了的威信”。
    美国记者约瑟夫·纽曼1月底和2月19日先后在阿根廷“号角报”上发表文章说，艾森豪威尔要访问南美，是因为他认为必须阻止“美国在拉丁美洲的地位继续恶化”。艾森豪威尔特别企图在访问中寻求“多边的集体行动”，来对古巴实行“经济和政治的制裁”。
    “基督教科学箴言报”1月7日发表一篇题为“谋求一个稳定的半球”的社论。它说，艾森豪威尔的南美之行是从事“后方阵营中极为重要的弥补工作”，“华盛顿需要在这些国家中表明它的友谊，特别是如果它不想遭到古巴僵局的再版……的话”。
    尽管华盛顿一再放出“亲善”、“友谊”的空气，一些美国通讯社和美国报刊直言不讳，美国对待拉丁美洲的根本的帝国主义政策不会改变。合众国际社2月9日从华盛顿发出的一条报道说，“华盛顿外交官员很少有人认为”，华盛顿对拉丁美洲的政策在这次总统访问以后会“立刻有根本的或巨大的变化”。2月1日“美国新闻与世界报道”在一篇关于这次访问的文章中承认，拉丁美洲人民普遍憎恨美国的帝国主义政策，它说，美国在历史上通过墨西哥战争、对巴拿马运河区的占领、海军陆战队在加勒比海各共和国登陆等作法来维持美国统治秩序和保护美国的财产，“这一切引起人们常常提出‘美帝国主义’这一熟悉的谴责”。但是，这家杂志说，艾森豪威尔此行的目的之一还是要促进美国对拉丁美洲的投资。它说，“刺激私人投资”和“保护美国的投资”是“美国对拉丁美洲政策中固定不变的组成部分”。
    面对拉丁美洲目前反美情绪激昂的形势，不少美国报纸很担心艾森豪威尔这次旅行将受到的遭遇。专栏作家李普曼1月28日在“华盛顿邮报”上写道，艾森豪威尔“这次访问要比他以往所进行的访问困难得多，而所冒的风险——在政治上所冒的风险——是非常大的”。李普曼指出，现在“南美群情愤懑”，在美国“同拉丁美洲的关系中，我们（美国）的表现向来是支持过去，反对将来。现在报应来了。反美就得人心，反美就代表进步”。
