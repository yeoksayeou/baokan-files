    Bees Cannot Be Dismissed

    The Soviet "Komsomolskaya Pravda" published an article on January 7 by Avetisyan, Doctor of Biology, entitled "Bees Cannot Be Dismissed," discussing the important role of bees in agriculture. An excerpt translation is as follows:

    Bees not only provide honey and beeswax, but are also invaluable to agronomists. This is because many plants can only bear fruit when pollinated by insects, and there are fewer and fewer pollinating insects. As people fight against pests and weeds, the living conditions for these insects are also being eliminated day by day. Their duties should be replaced by bees.

    Currently, the area of farmland in the Soviet Union pollinated by insects is over 15 million hectares. To pollinate crops on such a large area of farmland, at least 18 to 20 million beehives are needed. However, in 1958, collective farms and state farms had only a total of 4.6 million beehives. Pollinating fruit trees and berry bushes alone requires 7 to 8 million beehives, with three beehives needed per hectare of woodland.

    Take the pollination of sunflowers, for example. If bees are used for this task, the harvest can be increased, and fifteen to twenty kilograms of good honey can be collected from each hectare of sunflowers every summer.

    Bees can bring great benefits to cotton growers. The experience of Tziyev, Deputy Doctor of Agricultural Sciences, proves that cotton seeds pollinated by bees germinate three to seven days earlier than usual, and cotton matures six to ten days earlier than usual. In addition, the cotton yield can be increased by 19%. This means that due to the silent work of bees, eight million quintals of good cotton can be obtained, and to obtain this much cotton by ordinary methods, the planting area must be expanded by 400,000 hectares.

    The "May 1st" Collective Farm in the Krasnodar Krai used 600 beehives to pollinate gardens, sunflowers, alfalfa fields, and melon fields, thereby increasing its income by more than 660,000 rubles in 1958. The "Ak-Kurgan" State Farm in Tashkent Oblast obtained 26.1 quintals of seed cotton per hectare in cotton fields pollinated by bees. A large amount of experimental data from the Beekeeping Research Institute proves that the use of bees for pollination increases the yield of buckwheat by an average of 41%, sunflowers by an average of 40%, and purple alfalfa by an average of 75%. Pollination with bees can increase cotton production by 19%.

    Many state-owned beekeeping farms in the coastal area have achieved a record of obtaining an average of 60 to 70 kilograms of honey per hive. Consideration should be given to organizing joint beekeeping farms by collective farms. Bees cannot be dismissed; bees can and must be used to promote agricultural harvests.

### 不能解除蜜蜂的职务

    不能解除蜜蜂的职务
    苏联“共青团真理报”1月7日刊登了生物学博士阿维提襄的一篇题为“不能解除蜜蜂的职务”的文章，谈蜜蜂在农业中的重要作用，摘译如下：
    蜜蜂不仅提供蜂蜜和白蜡，而且是农学家的无价之宝。因为很多植物只有在昆虫授粉的情况下才能结果实，而授粉的昆虫越来越少。人在同害虫、杂草作斗争，这些昆虫生存的条件也在一天天消除。它们的职务应由蜜蜂代替。
    现在苏联用昆虫来传粉的农田面积有一千五百多万公顷。为了使这样大片农田的农作物受粉，至少要一千八百到二千万箱蜜蜂。而1958年，集体农庄和国营农场总共只有四百六十万箱蜜蜂。仅仅是果树——浆果林木受粉，就需要七百到八百万箱蜜蜂，每公顷林木需要三箱蜜蜂。
    就拿向日葵的授粉工作来说，如果用蜜蜂来从事这项工作，能增加收获量，而且每个夏天从每公顷向日葵中能采集出十五到二十公斤的好蜂蜜。
    蜜蜂能给植棉者带来很大好处。农业科学副博士齐耶夫的经验证明，得到蜜蜂授粉的棉种要比平常早发芽三到七天，棉花要比平常早熟六到十天。此外，棉花的收获量可增加19％。这就是说，由于蜜蜂的无声无息的工作可以多得到八百万公担好棉，而要用通常的办法获得这样多的棉花，则须扩大四十万公顷的播种面积。
    克拉斯诺达尔边疆区“五一”集体农庄利用六百箱蜜蜂在花园、向日葵、苜蓿地和瓜田里授粉，因而在1958年增加了六十六万多卢布的收入。塔什干州“阿克—库尔干”国营农场在用蜜蜂授粉的棉田里，每公顷得到了二十六点一公担的皮棉。养蜂研究所的大量实验资料证明，利用蜜蜂来授粉，使荞麦的收获量平均提高了41％，向日葵平均提高了40％，紫苜蓿平均提高了75％。用蜜蜂授粉可使棉花产量提高19％。
    沿海边区一带的许多养蜂国营农场达到了由一箱蜂平均获得六十到七十公斤的蜜的纪录。应当考虑组织集体农庄联合养蜂场。不能解除蜜蜂的职务，蜜蜂可以，而且必须利用来促进农业的丰收。
