Greatly developing collective pig farms across the country has been a significant characteristic of the pig farming industry's rapid development since last year. In addition to the tens of thousands of pig farms established by state-owned farms, livestock farms, government agencies, organizations, troops, enterprises, and schools, the people's communes and production teams, and communal canteens have established a total of two million collectively owned pig farms, averaging over eighty pig farms per commune. According to statistics, state and commune pig farms raise a total of more than 116 million pigs, accounting for about 64% of the country's total. Making every effort to run these pig farms well is the key to consolidating existing achievements and launching an even greater pig-raising upsurge on this basis.

The emergence of two million pig farms is a concrete manifestation of the superiority of the people's communes. The vast majority of pig farms were established after the establishment of the people's communes, especially during the pig-raising upsurge in the second half of last year. Shandong Province launched a "Take Pigs as the Key Link, Promote the Flourishing of Six Livestock" campaign in November last year, with more than 69,000 new pig farms established in one month, and the number of pigs increased by 21%. Such high speed was impossible in the era of small-scale farming, and difficult even during the period of advanced cooperatives. Only the unified management and planning of the people's communes, closely combining the establishment of pig farms with the needs of agricultural production, has made it possible to develop agriculture and pig raising simultaneously, promoting each other. Communes run breeding pig farms and sow farms, implementing self-breeding and self-raising, which can more favorably solve the problem of pig sources. Communes run training classes for breeders and epidemic prevention personnel, which can better solve breeding technology and epidemic prevention problems. Commune-run industries provide technical strength and material guarantees for tool reform in pig farms, and production teams with a weaker economic base can receive assistance from communes and wealthier teams to develop pig production. Under the unified leadership of the commune, the experience of advanced pig farms can be promoted in a timely manner. Without the people's communes, it would be difficult to imagine that millions of pig farms could spring up all over the country like bamboo shoots after a rain.

The emergence of two million pig farms marks the further development of the socialist collective ownership economy in China's rural areas. The income from pig raising in many communes already accounts for about 20% to 30% of the total commune income. Many commune-level pig farms have become powerful economic units in the people's communes, accumulating considerable funds for the people's communes and accounting for a significant proportion of the commune's collective economy. At the same time, a large number of production team pig farms have also played a significant role in developing agricultural production, consolidating the collective economy, and fully mobilizing the initiative of production teams and members.

The emergence of two million pig farms is also a great starting point for the high-speed development of pig farming in our country. In the near future, the number of pig farms will not be two million, but three million, four million, or even more; at the same time, pig farms will also gradually expand. Pig farms with dozens of pigs today may develop into pig farms with hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of pigs tomorrow. State-owned livestock farms can also establish large-scale pig farms with hundreds of thousands of pigs. As pig-raising experience gradually enriches, labor efficiency can also increase day by day. This grand vision is precisely the requirement put forward by the high-speed development of agricultural production to pig production.

Running two million pig farms well has such great significance, so how can these pig farms be run well?

Properly solving the feed problem is a key issue in running pig farms well. People need to eat, and pigs need feed, so it is necessary to attach as much importance to arranging pig feed as arranging people's rations. Each pig farm must have a year-round arrangement for pig feed to ensure a continuous supply. The method of solving the feed problem is, on the one hand, to mobilize members to widely collect and store various green and rough feeds and process and utilize various agricultural and sideline products in the appropriate seasons; on the other hand, each pig farm must have its own feed base to establish a reliable source of feed. Larger pig farms should also organize specialized feed production teams to be responsible for managing the production of feed crops. The feed fields of general pig farms can be managed concurrently by breeders, so that feeding and feed cultivation are combined.

The most urgent problem in running pig farms well at present is to do a good job in epidemic prevention in every possible way, ensuring that pigs do not die or die less. Throughout the years, spring has been the season with the most pig infectious diseases. Therefore, all localities must conscientiously do a good job in preventing pig diseases and strictly prevent the occurrence of epidemic infectious diseases in pigs. In case of illness, immediate inspection, disinfection, and isolation should be carried out, and timely treatment should be given by combining Chinese and Western medicine and using both indigenous and foreign methods. Concentrated pig farms have created many favorable conditions for carrying out epidemic prevention work; preventive injections can be given to every pig regularly, and it is easy to block and isolate pigs when they are sick. Each pig farm must establish a strict epidemic prevention system, train its own epidemic prevention personnel, and do a good job in the environmental sanitation of the pig farm.

In order to run these two million pig farms well, leading cadres of provincial, prefectural, and county party committees, as well as the party committees of people's communes, who are responsible for animal husbandry, must go deep into the pig farms to carry out "experimental plots." Leading cadres must acquire knowledge and experience from here, and discover and solve problems in a timely manner. Leading pig farming, like leading other work, requires leading cadres to be good at discovering typical examples and to summarize and exchange experiences in a timely manner. Now, many local county party secretaries and commune party secretaries personally go deep into the pig farms and establish "high-yield pens," "rapid fattening pens," and "feed command fields," etc., using these advanced experiences to guide the work of general pig farms. Zu Zhulin, the first secretary of the Wangyue Commune Party Committee in Changsha County, Hunan Province, went deep into the pig farm and, together with scientific research personnel and breeders, summarized the advanced experience of dividing groups, dividing pens, special personnel feeding, regular and quantitative feeding, and staged fattening, which powerfully promoted the great development of the commune's pig farming. This is worthy of emulation in various places. Pig farms can widely carry out appraisal and competition activities, organizing competitions between farms, between pens, and between breeders, in order to generally improve the management level of pig farms.

To run pig farms well, there must also be a group of activists who have initially mastered pig-raising techniques. Leading organs at all levels must adopt various effective methods, such as running training classes, holding technical lectures, and running schools, to train a large number of breeders, mating personnel, and epidemic prevention personnel, and build a professional team loyal to the people's commune's breeding cause. It is necessary to continuously improve the political awareness and professional level of existing breeders, and select those who love pig raising and have high political awareness to strengthen the pig-raising front. Eight counties in Jilin Province sent 500 party members and 3,600 outstanding commune members to pig farms, and Guangdong Province recently rectified the pig-raising team, with a large number of party members going to the forefront of pig raising. This is absolutely necessary.

Vigorously carrying out tool reform and technological innovation, and continuously improving labor efficiency, is also an issue that should be paid attention to in running pig farms well. At present, the work efficiency of pig farms across the country is still relatively low. This is because many pig farms are newly established, and they lack experience in large-scale collective pig raising. In terms of feeding, they still inherit the single-pen feeding method and heavy manual labor from the era of small-scale farming. This is very understandable. Moreover, in the early days of running pig farms, due to lack of experience, the primary issue is to raise pigs well, the work must be done particularly carefully, and it is also necessary to use more breeders. With the development of collective pig raising, especially with the emergence of large pig farms with thousands or even tens of thousands of pigs, it is also required to turn the pig farm into a pig cafeteria, where materials are stored centrally, cooked centrally, fed centrally, and managed centrally, as much as possible to improve work efficiency. According to existing experience and current conditions, earth mechanization can be implemented in a series of processes such as cutting materials, transporting water, cooking feed, transporting feed, and disposing of pig manure and urine. After the implementation of earth mechanization, not only can more pigs be raised, but also careful management can be carried out to feed the pigs big and fat.

A pig farm is like a factory. To manage and operate it well, it is necessary to establish some necessary and feasible management systems, such as stipulating the work responsibilities of each unit and individual, establishing a responsibility system and a reward and punishment system, and so on. Advanced pig farms have already explored a set of relatively sound organizational experience in feeding management, for example, setting up workshops for feeding, feed, mating, and epidemic prevention according to the pig-raising process, and implementing professional division of labor and cooperation. This approach is beneficial.

Conscientiously running the existing two million pig farms well is a central issue in developing pig farming at high speed this year. Since we have made such a great development in pig farming in just a few months, then now we must make up our minds, boost our energy, further run these two million pig farms well in a short period of time, and on this basis, establish more and better large-scale pig farms.

### 一定办好两百万个养猪场

    一定办好两百万个养猪场
    全国各地大办特办集体养猪场，是去年以来养猪业大发展的一个重要特点。除了国营农场、畜牧场、机关、团体、部队、企业和学校建立的数以万计的养猪场以外，各地人民公社和生产队、公共食堂建立的集体所有的养猪场共有两百万个，平均每个公社有八十多个养猪场。据统计，国家和公社养猪场养的猪共有一亿一千六百多万头，占全国猪只头数的64％左右。千方百计地把这些养猪场办好，这是巩固已有的成果，并在这个基础上掀起更大养猪高潮的关键。
    两百万个养猪场的出现，是人民公社优越性的具体表现。绝大部分的养猪场是在人民公社建立以后，特别是在去年下半年养猪高潮中建立起来的。山东省去年11月开展了一个“以猪为纲、六畜兴旺”的突击月，一个月新建猪场六万九千多个，猪只头数增加了21％。这样的高速度，不但小农经济的时代根本办不到，就是高级社时期也难以办到。只有人民公社统一经营，统一规划，把建立养猪场和农业生产的需要密切地结合起来，才作到了农业和养猪同时并举，互相促进。公社举办了种猪场和母猪场，实行自繁自养，可以更有利地解决猪源问题。公社举办了饲养人员和防疫人员训练班，可以更好地解决饲养技术和防疫问题。社办工业为猪场的工具改革提供了技术力量和物质保证，经济基础较差的生产队发展养猪生产的资金可以得到公社和富队的帮助。在公社的统一领导下，先进的养猪场的经验可以及时推广。没有人民公社，很难设想数以百万计的猪场能够像雨后春笋一般地在全国遍地兴办起来。
    两百万个养猪场的出现，标志着我国农村社会主义的公社所有制经济的进一步发展。不少公社的养猪收入已占公社总收入百分之二、三十左右。许多公社一级的养猪场，已经变成人民公社一个强大的经济单位，为人民公社积累了不少资金，在公社所有制的经济中占了相当大的比重。同时，大量的生产队的养猪场，对发展农业生产，巩固集体经济，充分发挥生产队和社员的积极性方面，也起了重大的作用。
    两百万个养猪场的出现，也是我国高速度发展养猪业的一个伟大的起点，不久的将来，养猪场的数量将不是两百万个，而是三百万、四百万以至更多；同时，养猪场也将逐渐扩大。今天有几十头猪的养猪场，明天就可能发展为几百头、几千头、以至几万头的养猪场。国营畜牧场还可以建立起几十万头的大型养猪场。由于养猪经验的逐渐丰富，劳动效率也可以日益提高。这个宏伟的远景，正是农业生产高速度发展向养猪生产所提出的要求。
    办好两百万个养猪场有如此重大意义，那末怎样把这些养猪场办好呢？
    妥善地解决饲料问题，是办好养猪场的一个关键问题。人要吃饭，猪要吃料，因此必须像安排人的口粮那样重视安排猪的饲料。各个养猪场对猪的饲料，一定要有全年安排，以保证源源不断的供应。解决饲料的方法，一方面要发动社员在适宜的季节广泛采集和贮存各种青粗饲料和加工利用各种农副产品；另一方面，每个养猪场都要有自己的饲料基地，把饲料来源建立在可靠的基础上。较大的猪场还应当组织饲料生产专业队，负责经营饲料作物的生产。一般猪场的饲料田可由饲养员兼管，做到喂养、种植饲料相结合。
    当前办好养猪场最迫切的问题，就是千方百计做好防疫工作，保证猪只不死亡或少死亡。历年来，春季是猪只传染病发生得最多的季节，因此，各地要切实做好猪病的预防工作，严格防止猪的流行性传染病发生。万一发现病情，要立刻检验，消毒隔离，并采取中西结合、土洋并举的办法，及时治疗。集中养猪的养猪场为开展防疫工作创造了许多有利条件；可以定期地一头不漏地进行预防注射，猪有了病，也便于封锁隔离。每个猪场都要建立严格的防疫制度，培养自己的防疫员，做好猪场的环境卫生工作。
    为了办好这两百万个养猪场，各省委、地委、县委以及人民公社党委负责畜牧业的领导干部，一定要深入到养猪场去，大搞“试验田”。领导干部要从这里取得知识，取得经验，及时发现问题和解决问题。领导养猪事业和领导其他工作一样，领导干部要善于发现典型，要及时总结和交流经验。现在，许多地方的县委书记、公社党委书记亲自深入到养猪场，建立了“高产圈”、“快速育肥圈”、“饲料指挥田”等，用这些先进经验去指导一般养猪场的工作。湖南长沙县望岳公社党委第一书记祖竹林深入养猪场，和科学研究人员、饲养员等一起总结出分群、分栏，专人饲养，定期、定量，分段育肥的先进经验，有力地推动了这个公社养猪事业的大发展。这是值得各地效法的。各养猪场可以广泛开展评比竞赛运动，组织场和场之间、圈和圈之间、饲养员和饲养员之间的竞赛，以便普遍提高养猪场的管理水平。
    要办好养猪场，还要有一批初步掌握了养猪技术的积极分子。各级领导机关要采取各种有效的方式，如开办训练班，举行技术讲授会，开办学校等来培养大批饲养员、配种员和防疫员，建成一支忠实于人民公社饲养事业的专业队伍。要不断提高现有饲养人员的政治觉悟和业务水平，要选择那些热爱养猪事业、政治觉悟高的人来加强养猪战线。吉林省有八个县派了五百名党团员和三千六百名优秀社员到养猪场去，广东省最近也整顿了一次养猪队伍，大批党团员开向养猪的第一线。这是完全必要的。
    大搞工具改革和技术革新，不断地提高劳动效率，也是办好养猪场应注意的问题。现在全国养猪场的工作效率还比较低。这是因为许多养猪场是新办起来的，对大规模的集体养猪还经验不足，在饲养方面还是承袭了小农经济时代单圈喂养的方法和繁重的手工操作。这是很可以理解的。而且在初办养猪场的时候，由于经验不足，首要的问题是把猪养好，工作要做得特别细致，多用一些饲养员也是必要的。随着集体养猪事业的发展，特别是几千头以至上万头的大猪场一出现，也要求把养猪场变成一个猪食堂，在猪食堂里集中贮料、集中煮食、集中喂养、集中管理，尽可能地提高工效。根据已有的经验和目前的条件，在切料、运水、煮饲料、运饲料和猪粪尿的处理等一系列工序上都可以实行土机械化。实行土机械化以后，不但可以养更多的猪，而且可以精心管理，把猪喂得又大又肥。
    一个养猪场像一个工厂一样，要经营管理得好，必须建立一些必要的切实可行的经营管理制度，例如规定每个单位和个人的工作职责，建立责任制度和奖惩制度等等。先进的养猪场在饲养管理方面已经摸索出一套比较健全的组织经验，例如，按照养猪的工序，分别设立饲养、饲料、配种和防疫等车间，实行专业的分工合作。这样作法是有好处的。
    认真办好现有的两百万个养猪场，是今年高速度发展养猪业的一个中心的问题。我们既然在短短的几个月内就使得养猪事业来了一个大发展，那末，现在，我们就一定下决心，鼓干劲，在短时间内，进一步办好这两百万个养猪场，并且在这个基础上，建立更多更好的大规模的养猪场。
