Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, February 27th. The late-stage cotton procurement work in Jiangsu Province is advancing rapidly, with daily cotton procurement volume rising steadily. Statistics show that in the week from February 17th to 23rd, the average daily procurement volume increased by four and a half times compared to the previous week and two and a half times compared to early February.

Since February, cadres and members of people's communes in cotton-producing areas of Jiangsu Province have continued to launch an upsurge in enthusiastically selling cotton to support industrial construction. In Xuzhou Prefecture, sixty-four people's communes in Fengxian, Peixian, Tongshan, and Suining counties sold over 1,634,000 jin of cotton in half a month, with more than half of the people's commune management areas exceeding their annual cotton procurement targets. Yancheng Prefecture launched a cotton procurement blitz week, resulting in a rapid increase in ginned cotton entering warehouses, with procurement volume in mid-February ranking first in the province. Nantong Prefecture adopted a point-to-area approach, with cotton sales from key cotton-producing people's communes surging four to ten times.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, February 27th. Shandong Province's cotton-producing areas conscientiously implement various policies and conduct in-depth ideological mobilization, resulting in a continuous rise in cotton procurement volume. Ginned cotton procured in mid-February increased by nearly 64% compared to early February.

Recently, various localities have further strengthened leadership over cotton procurement, with the first secretary of the Party committee taking the lead, conducting inspections and evaluations, and launching a blitz on cotton procurement. Zibo Prefecture, one of the major cotton-producing areas, has become the unit with the highest procurement volume and fastest progress in the province because it closely integrated cotton procurement with production work, expanded the procurement team, and conducted more thorough ideological work. In Jinan City, due to meticulous ideological education during the cotton procurement blitz, the city's cotton procurement volume in mid-February surged more than nine times compared to early February.

During this period, commercial departments made many efforts in cotton procurement. Many cotton-producing areas adopted various methods such as increasing procurement points, organizing more mobile procurement teams, going from street to street and alley to alley, and visiting households to purchase cotton, greatly facilitating the masses in selling cotton and organically combining large-scale procurement with small-scale procurement and centralized procurement with decentralized procurement, thereby accelerating the progress of cotton procurement. After Guangrao, Zouping, and other three counties dispatched more than 1,300 cadres to form 520 mobile procurement teams, the cotton procurement volume of each increased linearly. Many regions also paid attention to giving play to the leading role of activists in cotton procurement to promote a high tide of cotton sales. After Party members and activists of Lizeli People's Commune in Huimin County took the lead in delivering cotton, they conducted propaganda and mobilization among commune members, with everyone connecting and every household mobilizing, resulting in enthusiastic cotton sales, with commune members selling 141 dan of scattered cotton in twenty days.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, February 27th. In Changde Prefecture, a major cotton-producing area in Hunan Province, after the broad masses of commune members overfulfilled the 1959 new cotton procurement task by 20%, they continued to enthusiastically sell stockpiled cotton to support industrial production. As of February 20th, the ginned cotton procured by the entire district had also exceeded the first-quarter procurement task by 8% ahead of schedule.

Under the leadership of the Party committee, commercial departments at all levels in the district implemented the policy of procuring more, procuring quickly, procuring well, and procuring sufficiently, and publicized to the broad masses of commune members the significance of selling more cotton to support national socialist construction. Various localities adopted various methods to ensure that every cotton boll returned to the household, achieving a bumper harvest and increased sales. Anxiang County mobilized more than 3,000 commune members to find eyelash cotton, stiff petal cotton, fallen cotton, and half-cut cotton, and adopted the method of purchasing and selling simultaneously, purchasing 213 dan of ginned cotton in one day on February 3rd. Cotton-producing counties such as Hanshou, Shimen, and Changde also established cotton procurement offices at each level of the commune and team, implementing a one-stop procurement method of sending sales, purchasing, and packaging, which greatly accelerated the progress of procurement.
