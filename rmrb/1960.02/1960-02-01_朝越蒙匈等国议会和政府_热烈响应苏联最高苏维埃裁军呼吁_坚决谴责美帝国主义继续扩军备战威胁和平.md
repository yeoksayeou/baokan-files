Comprehensive report by our newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency dispatches: The call for joint disarmament issued by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to the parliaments and governments of all countries on January 15 continues to receive warm responses and support from the parliaments and governments of various countries.

	The Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a declaration on January 26, expressing full support for the call of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

	The declaration believes that the new measure taken by the Soviet Union to unilaterally reduce its troops by 1.2 million has set a practical example for further promoting disarmament and resolving the issue of comprehensive disarmament, and has made a great contribution to easing international tensions and striving for freedom and peace.

	The declaration said that due to the sincere efforts of the Soviet Union and the unremitting efforts of other socialist countries, the international situation has recently improved to a certain extent. However, we cannot ignore the fact that the aggressive groups of Western powers are still pursuing the "position of strength" policy that is facing complete bankruptcy, continuing to expand their armaments, and threatening world peace. US imperialism is blatantly reviving militarism in West Germany and Japan, and recently concluded a military alliance treaty with Japan - the Japan-US "Joint Cooperation and Security Treaty," which is intensifying the tense situation in the Far East. The responsibility for the failure to reach an agreement on the disarmament issue, which has been discussed for a long time at international conferences, lies entirely with the Western imperialists. The declaration said that the Western powers must put away their hypocritical empty talk about peace and disarmament and show their sincerity with practical actions in accordance with the example of the Soviet Union.

	The declaration said that in order to guide the Korean armistice towards a consolidated peace and to ease the tension in the Far East and the world, the Korean people have carried out a consistent struggle. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has not only unilaterally reduced its troop strength by 80,000, but has also repeatedly proposed reducing the armed forces of North and South Korea to less than 100,000 each, and suggested that the authorities of North and South Korea declare that they will not use force against each other. The declaration said, however, that the US imperialists who are occupying South Korea and their lackey, the Syngman Rhee clique, continue to increase their forces in South Korea and plot new war conspiracies. The US imperialists have brutally trampled on the Korean Armistice Agreement, shipped a large number of atomic and missile weapons into South Korea, and are openly carrying out military provocations.

	The declaration said that the Korean people resolutely condemn the US imperialists' adventurous and provocative actions that seriously threaten peace in Korea and the Far East. The US imperialist aggressor troops must immediately withdraw from South Korea with the atomic and missile weapons illegally shipped in. The tense situation in the Far East and Korea must be eased, peace must be consolidated, and the Korean issue must be resolved peacefully by the Korean people themselves.

	The declaration concluded by saying that the Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in the name of all the Korean people, once again warmly welcomes the call of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and will make every effort to realize the early implementation of the Soviet Union's series of proposals on reducing and abolishing troops.

	The National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam recently issued a statement expressing its heartfelt welcome to the call of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

	The statement said that in the past few years, the Soviet Union has completely withdrawn its armed forces from Romania, greatly reduced its troops stationed in the German Democratic Republic and Hungary, and abolished all its military bases in other countries. The statement emphasized that "these efforts made by the Soviet Union not only conform to the ardent aspirations of mankind, but also adapt to the current situation. Peaceful coexistence between countries with different political systems has become an extremely urgent requirement in the current stage of social development."

	The statement went on to say that the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is convinced that the Soviet Union's call will receive the support and sympathy of the people all over the world.

	The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on January 20, warmly welcoming the Soviet Union's decision to once again reduce its armed forces by 1.2 million.

	The statement said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the decision passed by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is in complete accordance with the deep aspirations of the people of all countries in the world who hope to live a life of peace and friendship.

	The Presidium of the Great People's Hural and the Council of Ministers of Mongolia issued a statement on January 25, expressing their warm welcome and full support for the call of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to the parliaments and governments of all countries.

	The statement said that the Soviet Union's decision to unilaterally reduce its armed forces by 1.2 million is a vivid manifestation of the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomatic policy and another important contribution made by the Soviet people to creating favorable conditions for reaching an agreement on the issue of comprehensive and thorough disarmament, and it has set a great example for all countries.

	The statement severely condemned the reactionary groups in Western countries for deliberately obstructing the solution of the disarmament issue, engaging in an arms race, piecing together reactionary military blocs, and stepping up the arming of West Germany and Japan. The statement emphasized that the US-Japan military alliance has brought a serious threat to the peaceful situation in the Far East. The statement said that the Mongolian People's Republic has consistently and resolutely pursued a policy of peaceful and friendly coexistence among the peoples of all countries since its founding. The statement pointed out that at present, the Mongolian People's Republic only possesses a small number of local troops, and military expenditures account for only 2.9% of budgetary expenditures.

	The statement concluded by saying that the Presidium of the Great People's Hural and the Council of Ministers of the Mongolian People's Republic realize the important significance of the peace initiative put forward by the Soviet Union and express their readiness to reduce their own troops at any time.

	The Hungarian National Assembly unanimously passed a resolution on January 30, firmly supporting the call of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to the parliaments and governments of all countries on the issue of disarmament. The resolution said that the initiative put forward by the Soviet Union on the issue of disarmament greatly contributes to the easing of the international situation and helps to strengthen the atmosphere of mutual trust. The resolution calls on Western countries to follow the example of the Soviet Union and take practical actions to embark on the road of starting disarmament.

	Before the passage of this resolution, Kish Karoly, member of the Political Bureau of the Socialist Workers' Party and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Hungarian National Assembly, made a report on the call of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to the parliaments and governments of all countries on the issue of disarmament. Kish talked about the great significance of the Soviet Union's unilateral reduction of its armed forces once again. He said that this will further enhance the great moral strength of the Soviet Union and enhance the prestige of the socialist camp.

	Kish went on to emphasize that the imperialist war forces are still making hopeless struggles in recent times. The US government has announced that it will conduct nuclear weapons tests, the French government has decided to explode atomic bombs in Africa to maintain its collapsing colonial empire, and the West German Adenauer government is reviving fascism and militarism and obstructing negotiations between major powers. Recently, the US-Japan military treaty signed in Washington has ignited the tense situation in the Far East. Kish said that these phenomena all warn us to redouble our efforts to carry out socialist construction and to strengthen the socialist camp.

    朝越蒙匈等国议会和政府
    热烈响应苏联最高苏维埃裁军呼吁
    坚决谴责美帝国主义继续扩军备战威胁和平
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：苏联最高苏维埃1月15日向各国议会和政府发出的关于共同裁军的呼吁书，继续得到各国议会和政府的热烈响应和支持。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会扩大会议1月26日发表宣言，表示完全支持苏联最高苏维埃的呼吁书。
    宣言认为，苏联采取的单方面裁军一百二十万人的新措施，对进一步促进裁军和全面裁军问题的解决，作出了实践的榜样，并对缓和国际紧张局势、争取自由和平的事业作出了巨大的贡献。
    宣言说，由于苏联进行了诚挚的努力以及其他社会主义国家也进行了始终不渝的努力，最近国际局势有了一定的改善。但是我们不能忽视西方大国侵略集团还在继续推行面临全面破产的“实力地位”政策，继续扩充军备，威胁世界和平。美帝国主义露骨地在西德和日本复活军国主义，最近又同日本缔结了军事同盟条约——日美“共同合作和安全条约”，在远东加剧紧张局势。在国际会议上讨论了很久的裁军问题未能达成协议的责任，也完全在于西方帝国主义者。宣言说，西方大国必须收拾起对和平和裁军的虚伪的空谈，依照苏联的榜样以实际行动来表示诚意。
    宣言说，朝鲜人民为了把朝鲜的停战导向巩固的和平，为了缓和远东和世界的紧张局势，进行了一贯的斗争。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府不仅单方面地裁减了兵员八万人，而且还屡次建议把南、北朝鲜的武装力量各自裁减到十万人以下，建议南、北朝鲜当局宣布不为反对对方而使用武力。宣言说，但是，强占着南朝鲜的美帝国主义者和它的走狗李承晚集团继续在南朝鲜增强兵力，策划新的战争阴谋。美帝国主义者粗暴地蹂躏了朝鲜停战协定，往南朝鲜运入了大量的原子和导弹武器，公然进行着军事挑衅行动。
    宣言说，朝鲜人民坚决谴责美帝国主义者严重威胁朝鲜和远东和平的这种冒险的挑衅行动。美帝国主义侵略军队必须带着非法运入的原子和导弹武器立即从南朝鲜撤走。远东和朝鲜的紧张局势必须缓和，和平必须巩固，朝鲜问题必须由朝鲜人民自己来和平解决。
    宣言最后说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会扩大会议以全体朝鲜人民的名义，再一次热烈欢迎苏联最高苏维埃的呼吁书，并将为苏联关于裁减和撤销军队的一系列建议的早日实现尽一切努力。
    越南民主共和国国会最近发表声明，表示衷心欢迎苏联最高苏维埃的呼吁。
    声明说，在过去几年中，苏联把它的武装部队完全撤出了罗马尼亚，大大减少了它驻在德意志民主共和国和匈牙利的军队，并且撤销了它在其它国家的一切军事基地。声明强调指出，“苏联所作的这些努力不仅符合人类热切的愿望，而且适应当前的局势。不同政治制度的国家之间的和平共处已经成为现阶段社会发展中极其迫切的要求。”
    声明接着说，越南民主共和国国会确信，苏联的呼吁书将得到全世界人民的支持和同情。
    越南民主共和国政府在1月20日发表声明，热烈欢迎苏联再次决定裁减武装部队一百二十万人。
    声明说，越南民主共和国政府认为，苏联最高苏维埃通过这个决定，完全符合希望过和平和友谊的生活的世界各国人民的深切愿望。
    蒙古大人民呼拉尔主席团和部长会议1月25日发表声明，表示热烈欢迎和完全支持苏联最高苏维埃致世界各国议会和政府的呼吁书。
    声明说，苏联决定单方面裁减武装力量一百二十万人的步骤是苏联和平外交政策的鲜明表现，是苏联人民为创造有利条件以便就全面彻底裁军问题取得协议而作出的又一重要贡献，它为各国树立了伟大榜样。
    声明严厉谴责西方国家反动集团故意阻挠裁军问题的解决、进行军备竞赛、拼凑反动军事集团、加紧武装西德和日本的行为。声明强调指出，美日军事同盟已经给远东和平局势带来了严重的威胁。声明说，蒙古人民共和国从建国以来一贯坚决奉行各国人民和平友好相处的政策。声明指出，目前，蒙古人民共和国只拥有属于地方性的数量很小的军队，军费开支只占预算支出的2．9％。
    声明最后说，蒙古人民共和国大人民呼拉尔主席团和部长会议意识到苏联提出的和平创议的重要意义，并表示随时准备裁减自己的军队。
    匈牙利国民议会会议1月30日一致通过决议，坚决支持苏联最高苏维埃就裁军问题致各国议会和政府的呼吁书。决议说，苏联就裁军问题提出的倡议大大有助于国际局势的缓和，有助于加强互相信任的气氛。决议要求西方国家效法苏联的榜样，以实际行动走上开始裁军的道路。
    在通过这个决议前，社会主义工人党政治局委员、匈牙利国民议会外交委员会主席基什·卡罗伊就苏联最高苏维埃关于裁军问题致各国议会和政府的呼吁书作了报告。基什谈到了苏联再一次单方面裁减武装部队的重大意义。他说，这将进一步提高苏联的伟大的道义力量，并提高社会主义阵营的威信。
    基什接着强调指出，帝国主义战争势力近来仍然在作无望的挣扎。美国政府宣布将进行核武器试验，法国政府决定在非洲爆炸原子弹来维持其崩溃着的殖民主义帝国，西德阿登纳政府正在复活法西斯主义和军国主义并阻挠大国谈判。最近，在华盛顿签订的美日军事条约燃起了远东的紧张局势。基什说，这些现象都警告我们，要加倍努力地进行社会主义建设，要加强社会主义阵营。
