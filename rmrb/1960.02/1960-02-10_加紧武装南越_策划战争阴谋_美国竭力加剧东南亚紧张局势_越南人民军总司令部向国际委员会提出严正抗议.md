Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi: Newspapers here reported on the 8th that the Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army wrote to the International Commission in Vietnam on February 1st, protesting against U.S. Army Secretary Bruck's illegal entry into South Vietnam on January 6th to intensify the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem group's activities of expanding armaments and preparing for war.

The letter pointed out that during his stay in South Vietnam, Bruck held talks with South Vietnam's "Defense Minister" Tran Trung Dung and the U.S. military advisory group in South Vietnam on relevant military issues.

The letter said that Bruck declared in Saigon that he was proud of South Vietnam's achievements due to its ties with the United States, and he stated that such ties should continue to be maintained in the future.

The letter pointed out that Bruck's above remarks once again proved the military collusion between the United States and South Vietnam, which violated Article 19 of the Geneva Accords.

On February 7th, the Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army also sent a telegram to the International Commission in Vietnam, protesting against the South Vietnamese authorities' allowing two South Korean destroyers to illegally enter South Vietnam on February 9th.

The telegram, after listing the facts of military collusion between the Ngo Dinh Diem group and the Syngman Rhee group, pointed out that the South Korean authorities' dispatch of warships to South Vietnam this time was not accidental, but a conspiracy to promote the establishment of a trilateral military alliance between South Vietnam, South Korea, and Taiwan, according to the plan of U.S. imperialism.

Prior to this, the Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army wrote to the International Commission in Vietnam on January 18th and 21st respectively, protesting against the United States' illegal transportation of large quantities of war materials into South Vietnam and its dispatch of additional aircraft to operate in South Vietnam.

On January 25th, the Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the People's Army wrote to the International Commission in Vietnam protesting that the "U.S. Temporary Equipment Replacement Team" had not withdrawn from South Vietnam in accordance with the International Commission's decision of December 27, 1958.

The Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army also wrote to the International Commission in Vietnam regarding the increasingly close military collusion between the South Vietnamese authorities and the Kingdom of Laos government and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, instigated by the United States.

In the above letters and telegrams, the Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army requested the International Commission in Vietnam to take urgent measures to force the South Vietnamese authorities to respect and strictly implement the Geneva Accords.

    加紧武装南越　策划战争阴谋
    美国竭力加剧东南亚紧张局势
    越南人民军总司令部向国际委员会提出严正抗议
    本报讯　据新华社河内电：这里报纸8日报道，越南人民军总司令部联络代表团2月1日写信给越南国际委员会，抗议美国陆军部长布鲁克曾经在1月6日非法进入南越，加紧进行美国—吴庭艳集团的扩军备战活动。
    信中指出，在南越逗留期间，布鲁克曾经同南越“国防部”部长陈忠容和美国在南越的军事顾问团就有关军事问题进行了会谈。
    信中说，布鲁克曾经在西贡宣称，他对南越由于它同美国的联系而取得的成就感到骄傲，他表示今后这种联系还要继续保持。
    信中指出，布鲁克上述的话再一次证明了美国和南越之间的军事勾结，这违反了日内瓦协议第十九条的规定。
    7日越南人民军总司令部联络代表团还打电报给越南国际委员会，抗议南越当局将让两艘南朝鲜驱逐舰在2月9日非法进入南越。
    电报在列举了吴庭艳集团和李承晚集团军事勾结的事实后指出，南朝鲜当局这次派遣军舰进入南越并非偶然，这是根据美帝国主义的计划，推动成立南越、南朝鲜和台湾三边军事联盟的阴谋。
    在这以前，越南人民军总司令部联络代表团在1月18日、21日分别就美国把大批战争物资非法运入南越、加派飞机到南越活动，写信给越南国际委员会提出抗议。
    1月25日，人民军总司令部联络代表团写信给越南国际委员会抗议“美国临时装备更新团”没有按照国际委员会1958年12月27日的决议撤出南越。
    越南人民军总司令部联络代表团还就美国唆使南越当局与老挝王国政府、东南亚条约组织之间进行日益密切的军事勾结，写信给越南国际委员会。
    越南人民军总司令部联络代表团在上述信件和电报中，都要求越南国际委员会采取紧急措施，迫使南越当局尊重和严格履行日内瓦协议。
