The Benefits of Beekeeping for Improving People's Lives and Developing the National Economy

Beekeeping is a productive undertaking with multiple benefits. The main products of beekeeping, honey and beeswax, are important medicines in traditional Chinese medicine. The "Shen Nong's Materia Medica" records: "Honey mainly treats evil qi in the heart and abdomen, calms the five internal organs, replenishes qi and invigorates the middle, detoxifies, removes various diseases, harmonizes with hundreds of medicines, long-term use strengthens the will, lightens the body, prevents aging and prolongs life." Modern scientific analysis and clinical medical experiments have proven that honey contains 75% glucose and fructose, as well as various vitamins and minerals. Honey taken internally can treat peptic ulcers, chronic constipation, high blood pressure, and heart disease, while external use can treat itchy, painful, moist, and ulcerative skin diseases. Traditionally, most pills in traditional Chinese medicine are made by mixing honey with medicinal powders, called the "honey refining pill method." Because honey is easy to digest and can prevent disease and kill bacteria, it is an extremely reasonable method.

Other bee products such as royal jelly, bee venom, and propolis also have significant effects on people's health. Royal jelly, in particular, has attracted great interest in the international medical community in recent years. Royal jelly is a substance secreted by worker bees from their pharyngeal glands. It is called royal jelly because it is specifically used to feed queen bees.

From the perspective of bee colony life, both the queen bee and worker bees are female insects. Whether a female egg grows into a queen bee or a worker bee mainly depends on the influence of royal jelly. For the first three days after bee eggs hatch into larvae, worker bees feed them royal jelly. However, if larvae continue to be fed royal jelly after three days, they will grow into queen bees with fully developed sexual organs. Conversely, if royal jelly is not provided and only bee bread (a mixture of pollen and honey) is used as feed, the larvae will grow into worker bees with underdeveloped sexual organs. Furthermore, the queen bee only needs sixteen days to complete its entire growth period, which is five days shorter than the twenty-one days it takes for a worker bee to develop from egg to adult. Also, laying queen bees, due to eating nutrient-rich royal jelly, can lay 1,500 to 2,000 eggs in a single day during peak laying season, and the total weight of these eggs exceeds the weight of the queen bee herself. Moreover, because queen bees regularly eat royal jelly, their lifespan can reach five years or more, while worker bees only live for a little over a month, and even during the bee colony's overwintering period, they live for a maximum of eight months. These facts demonstrate the unique position of royal jelly in medicine.

Research collaboration organizations have been established in Beijing, Shanghai, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Taiyuan, and other places by beekeeping and medical units. Clinical experiments have been conducted on more than a thousand cases across six departments and over thirty types of diseases. Preliminary evidence shows that royal jelly has good therapeutic effects on anemia, malnutrition, diabetes, heart disease, and diseases of the nervous system. Bee venom has a special effect on rheumatoid arthritis, and propolis is especially effective in treating corns. Significant progress has also been made in the production and preparation of royal jelly and bee venom. This is still a new research area both domestically and internationally. It benefits people's health and is also a new way to increase income in beekeeping production.

Beeswax has a wide range of uses. Besides being an indispensable raw material for making comb foundations in beekeeping production itself, beeswax is also needed in electrical, aviation, automobile manufacturing, textile industry, and national defense industries.

Honey and beeswax are not only in high demand domestically but are also popular export commodities. In recent years, linden honey produced in Heilongjiang and Jilin, lychee and longan honey produced in Guangdong and Fujian, and vitex honey produced in the northern mountainous areas of China are all top-quality honeys in terms of color, aroma, and taste, and are particularly praised in the foreign market.

The greater benefit of beekeeping is promoting agricultural production.

While collecting nectar, bees also pollinate plants, indirectly leading to a significant increase in the yield and quality of crops. The yield-increasing effect of bees pollinating crops often exceeds the economic value of producing honey, beeswax, and so on.

The vast majority of fruit trees, vegetables, forage grasses, and field crops are cross-pollinated. Many materials at home and abroad prove that bees are the most efficient and reliable pollinating insects. Bees have many fine and soft hairs all over their bodies, making it easy for pollen to adhere and be carried away, and they do not damage the flowers of plants. Each bee flies dozens of times a day, and each flight can visit many flowers. Each bee colony can have as many as tens of thousands of bees, ensuring the efficiency of pollination due to the large number of bees. Furthermore, bees have a characteristic: once a bee collects nectar from a certain plant, it continues to visit that plant until it stops flowering, and it does not easily change. Therefore, bees can better complete the pollination work of crops.

Using bees to pollinate crops is a measure that can increase production without expanding cultivated areas or increasing farming investment. At the same time, using bees for pollination can save a large amount of labor required for manual pollination and harvest a large amount of honey and beeswax, achieving a "double harvest of agriculture and beekeeping."

China's beekeeping production has entered a collective management era mainly based on people's communes. For people's communes, beekeeping is a good sideline with multiple benefits in diversified operations. Beekeeping not only does not compete with grain and cotton for land, but also helps increase crop production. Furthermore, in terms of management, it requires little investment and yields high returns, and women, the elderly, and the weak can all do it. The Yanhe Brigade of the Datai People's Commune in Beijing raised 750 bee colonies in 1958, each colony yielding more than 100 jin of honey, and beekeeping income accounted for about half of the brigade's total income. In the spring of 1959, the Jiangpu People's Commune in Conghua County, Guangdong Province, raised a total of 3,000 bee colonies, and each colony yielded 43 jin of honey during the one-month lychee flowering season alone. The income from selling honey covered the entire commune's four-month wage expenses. Conghua County has more than 900 beekeepers who raise more than 20,000 bee colonies, and each beekeeper can create more than 2,000 yuan of wealth annually on average. The Xixia People's Commune in Shanghai had 1,741 bee colonies in the spring of 1959, which doubled by autumn, and the total income from selling bees and honey was more than 90,000 yuan. Beekeeping can increase the commune's accumulation and increase the income of commune members, which is very beneficial to the people's communes.

Carry out large-scale collaboration in beekeeping scientific research and continuously improve the level of beekeeping technology

China has a vast territory with extremely rich honey source plant resources, including forests, grasslands, orchards, and farmlands. Our ancestors began raising bees more than 2,000 years ago. However, in the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China, beekeeping production did not receive the due development for a long time. Therefore, the foundation left for us in beekeeping production, especially in beekeeping scientific research, is very weak.

Under the guidance of the Party's correct policy, China's beekeeping industry has developed greatly in recent years. Especially under the promotion of the General Line, the People's Communes, and the Great Leap Forward of the people nationwide, China's beekeeping industry has shown a vigorous new situation. The number of bee colonies in 1959 increased from 500,000 to 600,000 in 1949 to 4.95 million (3.36 million native bee colonies and 1.59 million foreign bee colonies), and the output of honey and beeswax has also greatly increased.

China's beekeeping scientific research institutions have also been built from scratch. At the end of 1958, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences established the Beekeeping Research Institute, following the Party's policy of science serving production, research work taking two legs, and launching mass movements. In 1959, large-scale collaboration in beekeeping scientific research was carried out nationwide. The units participating in the collaboration included 132 units in 22 provinces and cities across the country, including grassroots units such as people's communes and state-owned bee farms, as well as universities and relevant scientific research institutions, forming a nationwide, interconnected, organized, and planned collaborative network for beekeeping scientific research.

Through the efforts of all collaborative units over the past year, beekeeping scientific research work has made great achievements, with a total of 65 research reports summarized. These research reports will play a positive role in guiding future beekeeping production.

The propagation of bee colonies and the increase of honey and beeswax production are the basic requirements of beekeeping production. In the past, some people believed that there was a contradiction between the propagation of bee colonies and the increase of honey and beeswax production. They believed that: "If you want to propagate bee colonies, you cannot collect much honey; if you want to collect much honey, you cannot produce beeswax." The 18 high-yield research reports submitted by collaborative units in various regions in 1959 showed that beekeeping can achieve both large-area high-yield and small-area high-yield; it can achieve high-yield under the conditions of fixed-location feeding, and it can also achieve high-yield in one season during the main honey flow period. The most prominent is the beekeeping professional team of the Zhaiqi People's Commune in Tonglu County, Zhejiang Province. With the soaring spirit of "people not leaving bees, bees not leaving flowers, chasing flowers to seize honey," they created the outstanding achievement of 10 bee colonies collecting a total of 14,160 jin of honey, producing 178 jin and 14 liang of beeswax, and increasing the bee colony by six times, achieving high yields of bees, honey, and beeswax. This beekeeping professional team had a total of 177 bee colonies and collected 57,252 jin of honey (an average of 323 jin per colony), achieving an all-round bumper harvest. This increased the national average yield (about 40 jin) by seven times.

There are also 322 bee colonies of the Tieli People's Commune in Qing'an County, Heilongjiang Province, which collected 21,800 jin of honey, produced 483 jin of beeswax, and increased the bee colonies by 2.6 times during the summer linden flowering season. The 58 bee colonies of the Good Seed Breeding Farm in Fuyu County, Jilin Province, collected a total of 12,860 jin of honey from April to August; a bee colony of Fujian Agricultural College conducted an annual transhumance experiment and collected 1,389 jin of honey; the Fruit Tree Research Institute of Shanxi Province conducted a fixed-location feeding experiment with two bee colonies and collected a total of 1,344 jin of honey. These research results have all proven that the three high-yields of "bees, honey, and beeswax" can be achieved simultaneously. Therefore, it completely shattered the outdated and conservative notion that "if you want to propagate bee colonies, you cannot collect much honey; if you want to collect much honey, you cannot produce beeswax."

The role of bee pollination in increasing production has been confirmed at home and abroad. In order to further ascertain the actual effect of bees pollinating crops and to directly obtain a demonstration effect, in 1959, various regions used bees to pollinate rapeseed, sunflowers, cotton, buckwheat, fruit trees, etc., and conducted experiments on increasing production. Twelve experimental reports were submitted, proving that production can be increased by 23% to 70% or more. The bee pollination experiment on rapeseed at Fujian Agricultural College proved that rapeseed production increased by 55% to 70%, the oil content of rapeseed increased by 4.62%, and the vitality of the seed offspring also significantly improved. The experiment conducted by the Subsidary Food Production Command of the Nanhuai County Party Committee in Shanghai showed that cotton production increased by 32.3%, and the lint percentage increased by 3.09%. The bee pollination experiment conducted by the Mudanjiang Agricultural Science Research Institute of Heilongjiang Province and more than a dozen other units proved that sunflower production increased by 34% to 50%, the thousand-grain weight of seeds increased by 53%, and the kernel yield increased by 48%; buckwheat production increased by 25% to 50%. The experiment at the Xiangkuang Bee Farm in Jiangxi Province showed that citrus production can be increased by more than two times. These experiments all showed that using bees to pollinate crops not only can obtain a large amount of honey and beeswax, but is also one of the important measures to increase agricultural production, which deserves attention.

In order to try to change the living habits of bee colonies, many bee farms have studied the living habits of bee colonies and conducted a series of researches on bee colony management. For example, changing "single-box management" to "group management" to organize a major division of labor in bee colony propagation, honey collection, and beeswax production; changing the original one queen per nest to "multi-queen co-nesting"; changing small wooden box feeding to large bee room feeding; using artificial heating methods to promote rapid reproduction of bees, etc. These studies have all achieved preliminary results and are the beginning of a major revolution in beekeeping technology. In the future, we need to further carry out research in this area and comprehensively utilize these innovative technologies in beekeeping production, which can multiply accelerate bee colony propagation and improve bee colony productivity.

In terms of preventing and controlling bee diseases and insect pests, a parasitic mite has occurred in recent years in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong and other places, endangering bee colonies. Bee mites parasitize on the bodies of adult bees and larvae, relying on sucking the body fluids of bees for a living. In bee colonies with bee mites, the lifespan of bees is shortened. In severe cases, the entire bee colony is rapidly weakened, and even the entire bee colony is destroyed. Bee mites spread rapidly and seriously threaten beekeeping production. In 1959, beekeeping units in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanchang and other places organized a research collaboration group for the prevention and control of bee mites. Based on summarizing the mass prevention experience, it was concluded that the use of mothballs, rotenone and other drugs can not only eliminate bee mites but also do not affect the safety of bees, basically solving the threat of bee mites to beekeeping production.

Strive for the rapid development of China's beekeeping industry

China's beekeeping production still has great development potential. At present, there are only 5 million bee colonies nationwide. Calculated by land area, there is only one bee colony per two square kilometers (several brother countries in Eastern Europe have about three to seven bee colonies per square kilometer); from the perspective of unit output, advanced bee farms can produce an average of hundreds of jins of honey per colony, while the average yield of most bee farms is only a few tens of jins per colony. Especially at present, most of the domestic bee colonies are still using old methods and are raised in fixed beehives such as bamboo cages and wooden barrels. These old-style beehives can only adopt backward methods to collect honey, each bee colony can only collect about ten jins of honey per year, and it is impossible to control the propagation of bee colonies. Native bees are native bee species in China, which are characterized by diligence, cold and heat resistance, and good at collecting scattered honey sources, and are excellent bee species. However, in the past, some people always thought that native bees had low yields and were not as good as foreign bees. In fact, the low honey production is not their nature, mainly because the feeding and management methods are not good. Experience in various regions has proved that as long as the bee colonies in the old-style beehives are transferred to movable frame beehives for feeding and scientific management is added, the output can be increased several times. This is a technological innovation measure that needs to be vigorously promoted.

At the same time, it is also necessary to carry out local variety surveys and breeding work. There are many varieties of bees in China. According to existing data, native bees have several colors, including yellow, black, and brown. In terms of the size of bees, there are row bees that are twice as large as ordinary bees, and there are also small bees that are no larger than flies. Conducting a systematic survey and research on these rich bee varieties, and further cultivating new varieties with strong productivity to serve production, is one of the basic tasks of beekeeping scientific research.

Honey source is the basis of beekeeping production. Therefore, it is necessary to comprehensively understand the types, distribution, area, flowering period and other conditions of honey source plants as the basis for planning China's development of beekeeping production. In order to plan the development of beekeeping production and rationally allocate bee colonies, Heilongjiang Province has preliminarily completed the survey of honey source plants throughout the province. According to the survey calculation, the province can accommodate about 5 million bee colonies, while there are only 200,000 bee colonies in the province, and there is still great development potential.

Bees have a pollination and yield-increasing effect on fruit trees, trees, and pasture seeds, while at the same time, fruit trees, trees, and pastures are mostly good honey sources for beekeeping. Therefore, while establishing livestock feed bases, planting fruit trees on a large scale, and greening and afforestation, beekeeping production can be developed in conjunction. On the basis of the widespread use of bee pollination in crops, we will study the chain production measures of orchards, afforestation, livestock development, and large-scale beekeeping. For example, using bees to pollinate fruit trees and pastures to increase production, while fruit trees and pastures provide a large amount of honey source for beekeeping production. Developing animal husbandry with pasture and using livestock manure as fertilizer for fruit trees and feed crops. This method of vigorously developing animal husbandry, fruit tree horticulture, greening and afforestation, and beekeeping in combination with China's landscape gardening vision will make people's lives happier and better.

Beekeeping science includes disciplines such as botany, entomology, genetics, chemistry, mechanics, and medicine. It is impossible to improve the research level without the cooperation of relevant departments. Similarly, no research department can cover all relevant sciences from basic to applied topics. Therefore, in terms of research methods, we must unswervingly implement the Party's policy, continue to widely mobilize the masses, and carry out large-scale research collaboration.

Under the brilliant light of the General Line, we have the confidence to popularize beekeeping scientific knowledge in three to five years, basically making every people's commune have trained beekeeping personnel, and build a corresponding beekeeping scientific research team. With close collaboration with brother units, we will exert the power of the collective to make the beekeeping industry develop more rapidly and serve China's socialist construction cause.

    养蜂业在国民经济和人民生活中的作用
    中国农业科学院养蜂研究所所长　李俊
    养蜂对改善人民生活发展国民经济都有好处
    养蜂是一项有着多种收益的生产事业。养蜂的主要产品蜂蜜和蜂蜡，就是祖国医学中的重要药物。在“神农本草经”上就有这样的记载：“蜂蜜主治心腹邪气，安五脏诸不足，益气补中，解毒，除众病，和百药，久服强志轻身，不老延年”。近代科学的化验和医学上的临床实验证明：蜂蜜中含有75％的葡萄糖和果糖，还有多种维生素和矿物质；蜂蜜内服能治疗消化性溃疡、慢性便秘及高血压、心脏病等，外用能治痒痛湿烂性皮肤病。中医传统上对于丸药的制造，大部分采用蜂蜜捣和药粉而成，叫做“炼蜜为丸法”。因蜂蜜容易消化，且能防病灭菌，所以是极为合理的办法。
    蜜蜂的另一些产品如王浆、蜂毒、蜂胶等，对人民健康都有着显著的作用。特别是王浆，近几年来在国际医学界引起了极大的兴趣。王浆是蜜蜂（工蜂）从咽腺分泌出来的一种物质。这种物质所以叫做王浆，是因为它是专门用来饲喂蜂王的食料。
    从蜂群的生活上看，蜂王和工蜂都是雌性虫，一颗雌性的卵成长为蜂王或者工蜂，主要受王浆的影响。蜜蜂的卵从孵化成幼虫以后的三天内，工蜂都用王浆饲喂这些幼虫，但三天以后的幼虫，如果继续用王浆饲喂，就成长为性器官发育完全的蜂王。相反的情况下，如果不给王浆，只用普通的花粉和蜜的混合物——蜂粮作为幼虫的饲料，就成长为性器官发育不完全的工蜂。并且蜂王在整个成长期间只需十六天，比工蜂从卵到成虫需二十一天缩短了五天。还有，产卵蜂王由于吃了营养丰富的王浆，在产卵盛期，一昼夜可以产卵一千五百个到二千个，这些卵的总重量超过蜂王本身的体重。更由于蜂王经常以王浆为食料，它的寿命能达到五年以上，而工蜂只能活一个多月，即使在蜂群越冬期间也最多活八个月。这些事实说明，王浆在医学上有它独特的地位。
    北京、上海、福州、广州、太原等地的养蜂和医疗单位先后建立了研究的协作组织。在六个科，三十多个病种方面，已经有了一千个病例以上的临床实验。初步证明王浆对贫血、营养不良、糖尿病、心脏病以及神经系统方面的疾病有很好的治疗效果。蜂毒对风湿性关节炎，蜂胶对治疗脚鸡眼更有特殊的效果。在王浆和蜂毒的生产以及制剂方面，也取得了很大的成绩。这在国内外都还是一件新的研究工作。它对人民健康有好处，也是养蜂生产上增加收入的一个新门路。
    蜂蜡的用途很广，除了在养蜂生产本身是制造巢础不可缺少的原料外，在电气、航空、汽车制造、纺织业以及国防工业方面都需要蜂蜡。
    蜜、蜡不但在国内大量需要，也是很受欢迎的出口物资。近年来，我国黑龙江、吉林生产的椴树蜜，广东、福建生产的荔枝和龙眼蜜，北方山区生产的荆条蜜，无论在色、香、味方面都是蜂蜜中的上品，尤其受到国外市场的赞誉。
    养蜂更大的好处，是促进农业增产。
    蜜蜂在采集百花甜汁的同时，也给植物进行了授粉的工作，间接地使农作物的产量和质量有着显著的提高。蜜蜂在为农作物授粉而起的增产作用，常常超过了生产蜜、蜡等等本身的经济价值。
    极大多数的果树、蔬菜、牧草以及大田作物都是异花授粉的。国内外有很多材料证明，蜜蜂是授粉昆虫中效率最高，并且是最可靠的一种。蜜蜂全身有多而细软的绒毛，容易使花粉粘着和传播出去，对植物的花朵没有损伤。每只蜜蜂一天出动几十次，每次出动可以采访许多花，每群蜂可以多到有几万只蜜蜂，数量多，也保证了传粉的效率。并且蜜蜂还有这样的一种特性：当这只蜜蜂一经采集某种植物的花蜜，它一直采访这种植物的花，直到这种植物停止开花，不轻易改变。因此，蜜蜂也就能够更好地完成农作物的授粉工作。
    利用蜜蜂给农作物进行授粉，这是不需要扩大耕种面积，不增加耕作投资，而能够增产的措施。同时，利用蜜蜂授粉还能节省大量的人工辅助授粉所需要的劳动力，而且收获大量的蜜、蜡，达到“农业和养蜂两丰收”。
    我国的养蜂生产已进入以人民公社为主的一种集体经营事业，对于人民公社来说，养蜂是多种经营中有多方面利益的一种好副业。养蜂不但不和粮棉争地，还能帮助农作物增产。并且在经营上，投资少、收益大，妇女、老、弱都干得了。北京市大台人民公社沿河大队，1958年养七百五十群蜂，每群收一百多斤蜜，养蜂收入约占全队总收入的一半。广东省从化县江埔人民公社1959年春季共养蜂三千群，仅在一个月的荔枝花期，每群收蜜四十三斤。用卖蜜的收入开支了全社四个月的工资。从化县共有九百多个养蜂员，饲养两万多群蜜蜂，平均每个养蜂员每年可以创造两千元以上的财富。上海市下沙人民公社1959年春季有蜂一千七百四十一群，到秋后翻了一番，连卖蜂带卖蜜共收入九万多元。养蜂能增加公社的积累，增加社员的收入，对人民公社的利益是非常显著的。
    开展养蜂科学研究大协作，不断提高养蜂技术水平
    我国幅员广大，有极为丰富的森林、草原、果园、农田等蜜源植物资源。远在两千多年以前，我们的祖先就开始饲养蜜蜂。但是，在半封建、半殖民地的旧中国，养蜂生产长期得不到应有的发展。因此，在养蜂生产上，特别是养蜂科学研究上，给我们留下的基础是十分薄弱的。
    新中国的养蜂事业，在党的正确方针指导下，近年来有了很大的发展。特别是在总路线、人民公社以及全国人民大跃进的推动下，我国的养蜂事业出现了蓬蓬勃勃的崭新局面，1959年蜂群数量已从1949年的五十至六十万群增加到四百九十五万群（本国蜂三百三十六万群，外来种蜂一百五十九万群），蜜、蜡的产量也有很大的增加。
    我国的养蜂科学研究机构也从无到有地兴建起来。1958年年底，中国农业科学院成立了养蜂研究所，遵循党的科学为生产服务，研究工作要用两条腿走路，大搞群众运动的方针，1959年在全国范围内开展了养蜂科学研究的大协作。参加协作的单位包括全国二十二个省市，既有人民公社和国营的养蜂场等基层单位，也有大专院校和有关的科学研究机关共一百三十二个，初步形成了遍及全国、脉络贯通、有组织、有计划的养蜂科学研究协作网。
    通过一年来全体协作单位的努力，养蜂科学研究工作有了很大的成绩，共总结出六十五篇研究报告。这些研究报告对指导今后养蜂生产将起到积极的作用。
    蜂群的增殖和增产蜜、腊是养蜂生产的基本要求。过去有人认为，蜂群的增殖和增产蜜、蜡这三者之间是有矛盾的。他们认为：“要繁殖蜂群就不能多收蜜，要多收蜜就不能生产蜡”。1959年各地协作单位提出的十八篇丰产研究报告表明，养蜂既可以达到大面积丰产，也可以小面积高额丰产；既可以在定地饲养的条件下获得丰产，也可以在主要流蜜期一季获得丰产。最突出的是浙江省桐庐县窄溪人民公社的养蜂专业队。他们搞了一个千斤群试验组，以“人不离蜂，蜂不离花，追花夺蜜”的冲天干劲，创造了十群蜜蜂共收蜜一万四千一百六十斤，产蜂蜡一百七十八斤十四两，蜂群还增殖六倍的蜂、蜜、蜡三高产的优异成绩。这个养蜂专业队共有一百七十七群蜜蜂，收蜜五万七千二百五十二斤（每群平均三百二十三斤），获得了全面丰收。比全国平均产量（约四十斤）提高了七倍。
    还有黑龙江省庆安县铁力人民公社的三百二十二群蜜蜂，在夏季椴树开花期间，一季就收蜜二万一千八百斤，产蜡四百八十三斤，增殖蜂群二点六倍。吉林省扶余县良种繁育场的五十八群蜂，从4—8月共收蜜一万二千八百六十斤；福建农学院的一群蜂，作周年转地的试验，收蜜一千三百八十九斤；山西省果树研究所用两群蜜蜂做定地饲养的试验，共收蜜一千三百四十四斤。这些研究成果，都证明了“蜂、蜜、蜡”三高产是可以同时获得的。因而彻底粉碎了：“要增殖蜂群就不能多收蜜，要多收蜜就不能生产蜡”的陈腐保守观念。
    蜜蜂授粉增产的作用在国内外都已得到证实。为了进一步查明蜜蜂为农作物授粉增产的实际效果和直接取得示范的作用，1959年各地用蜜蜂对油菜、向日葵、棉花、荞麦、果树等作了授粉增产的试验。提出了十二篇试验报告，证明可以增产23％—70％以上。福建农学院的蜜蜂对油菜授粉试验，证明菜子增产55％—70％，菜子的含油量提高4．62％，种子后代的生活力也有显著的提高。中共上海市南汇县委副食品生产指挥部的试验，棉花增产32．3％，衣分率提高3．09％。黑龙江省牡丹江农业科学研究所等十几个单位所做的蜜蜂授粉试验，证明向日葵增产34％—50％，种子的千粒重增加53％，出仁率提高48％；荞麦增产25％—50％。江西省向圹种蜂场的试验，柑桔可增产两倍多。这些试验，都说明了利用蜜蜂对农作物的授粉，不但能取得大量的蜜、蜡，并且是农业增产的重要措施之一，是值得重视的。
    为了试图改变蜂群的生活规律，很多养蜂场钻研了蜂群的生活习性，对蜂群管理进行了一系列的研究。如改变“单箱管理”为“分组管理”，组织蜂群的繁殖、采蜜、产蜡大分工；改变原来每巢一个蜂王为“多王同巢”；改小木箱饲养为大蜂室饲养；用人工加温的方法，促使蜜蜂的快速繁殖等。这些研究都得到了初步的成效，是养蜂技术大革新的开端。今后还要进一步开展这方面的研究，在养蜂生产上综合地利用这些革新技术，将可以成倍地加速蜂群的繁殖和提高蜂群的生产率。
    在防治蜜蜂病虫害方面，近年来在江苏、浙江、江西、广东等地发生一种寄生螨，为害蜂群。蜂螨寄生在蜜蜂成虫及幼虫的体躯上，依靠吮吸蜜蜂的体液为生，有蜂螨的蜂群，蜜蜂寿命缩短，在严重的情况下，整个蜂群迅速削弱，甚至整个蜂群被毁灭。蜂螨蔓延迅速，严重地威胁养蜂生产。1959年以上海、杭州、南昌等地的养蜂单位为主，组织了防治蜂螨的研究协作组，在总结群众防治经验的基础上，得出使用卫生球、鱼藤精等药剂，既可消灭蜂螨，又不影响蜜蜂的安全，基本上解决了蜂螨在养蜂生产上的威胁。
    为迅速发展我国养蜂业而奋斗
    我国养蜂生产还有很大的发展潜力，目前全国只有五百万群蜜蜂。以国土面积计算，每二个平方公里才有一群蜂（东欧的几个兄弟国家每一平方公里约有三—七群蜂）；从单位产量上看，先进蜂场平均每群可产蜜几百斤，而大部分蜂场每群蜂的平均产量不过几十斤。尤其是目前大部分的本国种蜂群，还沿用着旧的方法，饲养在竹笼、木桶等固定的蜂巢中，这些旧式蜂巢只能采用落后的方法取蜜，每群蜂每年不过收蜜十来斤，并且无法控制蜂群的繁殖。本国蜂是我国土生土长的蜂种，具有勤劳、耐寒耐热、善于采集分散蜜源的特点，是一种优良的蜂种。但是，过去有些人总认为本国蜂产量低，不如洋蜂好，其实产蜜少并不是它的本性，主要在于饲养管理的方法不好。各地经验证明，只要把旧式蜂巢里的蜂群过到活框蜂箱里饲养，再加以科学管理，产量可以增加几倍。这是需要大力推广的一项技术革新措施。
    与此同时，还需要进行地方品种的调查和良种选育工作。我国蜜蜂品种是多种多样的。据现有的资料，本国种蜜蜂在色泽上有黄、黑、棕色几种，在蜜蜂的体格上，大的有比普通蜜蜂大一倍的排蜂，也有比苍蝇大不了多少的小蜜蜂。把这些丰富的蜜蜂品种进行系统的调查和研究，并且进一步培养出生产力强的新品种，为生产服务，这是养蜂科学研究的基本任务之一。
    蜜源是养蜂生产的基础。因此，需要全面了解蜜源植物的种类、分布、面积、花期等情况，作为规划我国发展养蜂生产的依据。黑龙江省为了有计划的发展养蜂生产，合理配置蜂群，初步完成了全省的蜜源植物调查工作。根据调查计算，全省约可容纳五百万群蜜蜂，而目前全省仅有二十万群，还有很大的发展潜力。
    蜜蜂对果树、林木和牧草种子有着授粉增产作用，而同时果树、林木和牧草又大都是养蜂的良好蜜源，因此，在建立畜牧业的饲料基地、大规模栽培果树、绿化造林的同时都可以结合发展养蜂生产。在农作物普遍利用蜜蜂授粉的基础上，研究果园、造林、发展畜牧业和大搞养蜂的连锁性生产措施。例如，利用蜜蜂为果树、牧草授粉增产，而果树、牧草又为养蜂生产提供大量的蜜源。以牧草发展畜牧业，并且以牲畜粪便作为果树、饲料作物的肥料。这种结合我国园林化的远景规划，大力发展畜牧业、果树园艺、绿化造林以及养蜂业的办法，将使人民的生活更加幸福美好。
    养蜂科学包括植物、昆虫、遗传、化学、机械以及医学等学科。如果不取得有关部门的协作，是不可能提高研究水平的。同样，任何一个研究部门，都不可能把有关的科学从基础到应用性的课题全部包下来。因此在研究方法上，我们要坚定不移地贯彻党的方针，继续广泛的发动群众，大搞研究协作。
    在总路线的光辉照耀下，我们有信心在三至五年内普及养蜂科学知识，基本上使每一个人民公社都有经过训练的养蜂人员，并建成一支相适应的养蜂科学研究队伍。在与兄弟单位的紧密协作下，发挥集体的力量，使养蜂业更加迅速地发展起来，为我国的社会主义建设事业服务。
