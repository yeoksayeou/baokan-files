Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd, San Juan Dispatch: U.S. President Eisenhower, on his way to visit South America, encountered large-scale anti-American demonstrations when he arrived at San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico, the first stop on his journey on the morning of the 22nd. The people of Puerto Rico greeted the American President with loud slogans demanding independence and opposing American colonial rule.

Despite the deployment of a large number of military police by the Puerto Rican authorities, thousands of demonstrators in San Juan gathered in groups at the international airport and around the U.S. Ramey Air Force Base, located ninety miles from the airport, several hours before Eisenhower's arrival, preparing to express their firm protest to Eisenhower. Demonstrators held up signs reading: "We want peace, let us get rid of colonialism!" "America is oppression!" "Ike, don't forget your promises of independence!" "Give us the freedom to expand ties with Latin America!" The demonstrators distributed a large number of leaflets along the highway from the airport to the capital, opposing American colonial oppression and demanding Puerto Rican independence.

Eisenhower, amid the tense atmosphere of heavily armed military police, stepped off the plane and hurriedly delivered a brief speech at the airport, in which he described this American colony, maintained by a large number of American troops, as "a proud, free, and self-governing area."

Eisenhower said that Puerto Rico had joined the United States "according to its own choice," and that the "achievements" Puerto Rico had made "inspired hope" in many others around the world.

According to a United Press International report, although the demonstrators "were isolated outside the airport fence, Eisenhower could clearly see their large signs 'demanding Puerto Rico's immediate independence!'"

While Eisenhower subsequently met with Puerto Rican Governor Marin in a room at the airport, Puerto Rican masses continued to demonstrate outdoors, demanding independence.

That day, San Juan's "El Imparcial" published an editorial occupying half a page, demanding Puerto Rican independence. The editorial stated, "The current colonial system is completely unsatisfactory to our people," and "As a nation, we have the right to independence."

According to a Latin American News Agency report, anti-American demonstrations and marches were held throughout the island of Puerto Rico on the 22nd. (Attached picture)
    Eisenhower passed through San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico, and local people held anti-American demonstrations in front of the airport.
    Puerto Ricans living in the United States "saw off" Eisenhower in front of the White House in Washington. On the "send-off" people's signs were drawings of the maps of the United States and Puerto Rico, with a chain in the middle, indicating that Puerto Rico was locked up by the United States.

    要求独立自由，反对殖民统治！
    波多黎各人民向艾森豪威尔示威
    新华社23日讯　圣胡安消息：前往南美访问的美国总统艾森豪威尔22日上午在到达途中第一站波多黎各首都圣胡安时，就遭遇到大规模的群众反美示威。波多黎各人民用要求独立、反对美国殖民统治的响亮口号来迎接这位美国总统。
    尽管波多黎各当局出动大批军警进行戒备，圣胡安数千名示威群众在艾森豪威尔到达的前几小时就成群结队地集中在国际机场和离这个飞机场九十英里的艾森豪威尔准备前往过夜的美国鲁梅空军基地的周围，准备向艾森豪威尔表示坚决的抗议。示威者高举着标语牌，上面写着：“我们要和平，让我们摆脱殖民主义！”“美国就是压迫！”“艾克，不要忘记你作出的关于独立的诺言！”“给我们同拉丁美洲扩大联系的自由！”示威群众在飞机场通往首都的公路上散发反对美国殖民压迫、要求波多黎各独立的大批传单。
    艾森豪威尔在军警严布的紧张气氛中走下飞机后，匆匆在机场发表简短演说，他在演说中还把这个依靠大批美国驻军保持的美国殖民地说成是“一个自豪的、自由的和自治的地区”。
    艾森豪威尔说，波多黎各已经按照“它自己的选择参加了美利坚合众国”，波多黎各获得的“成就”使全世界其他许多人“抱有希望”。
    据合众国际社消息，虽然示威群众“被隔绝在机场的栅栏之外，但是艾森豪威尔却清清楚楚地看得到他们‘要求波多黎各立即独立！’的大幅标语”。
    在艾森豪威尔随后同波多黎各总督马林在机场的一间房屋里会谈的时候，波多黎各群众在室外继续举行示威，要求独立。
    当天的圣胡安“公正报”以半版篇幅发表社论，要求波多黎各独立。社论说，“目前的殖民制度完全不能使我国人民满意”，“作为一个民族，我们有独立的权利”。
    据拉丁美洲通讯社消息，22日波多黎各全岛都举行了反美示威游行。（附图片）

    居住在美国的波多黎各人在华盛顿白宫前“欢送”了艾森豪威尔。在“送行者”的标语牌上画的是美国和波多黎各的地图，中间有一条锁链，表示波多黎各被美国锁死了。
