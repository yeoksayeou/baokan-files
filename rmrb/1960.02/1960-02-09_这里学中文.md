    "Learning Chinese Here"
    At the entrance of a classroom in the Kiev Polytechnic Institute in the Soviet Union, a sign reading "Learning Chinese Here" is hung up every evening. At this time, on the blackboard where mathematical equations were written not long ago, neatly written Chinese characters appear.
    The Chinese language learning group was established not long ago. In addition to students from the Kiev Polytechnic Institute, students from other higher industrial technology schools are also learning. The group is led by their classmates—Chinese students studying abroad. With the help of Chinese teachers from the First Boarding Middle School in Kiev, the group has developed a teaching syllabus. Currently, the group members have learned hundreds of Chinese characters, can understand general everyday conversations, and can read newspapers.
    This is not the only Chinese language group in Kiev. Students from the National Shevchenko Kiev University, the Foreign Language Teachers College, and other higher education institutions are also learning Chinese.

    “这里学中文”
    苏联基辅工学院的一个教室的门口，每到晚上便挂出“这里学中文”的牌子。这时候，在不久以前还写着数学方程式的黑板上，出现了抄写工整的方块字。
    中文学习小组成立还不久。学习的人除了基辅工学院的学生以外，还有别的高等工业技术学校的学生。小组由他们的同学——中国留学生领导。在基辅第一寄宿中学中文教员的帮助下，小组拟订了教学大纲。目前，小组组员已经学会了几百个汉字，能听一般生活会话，还能读报。
    这不是基辅唯一的中文小组。国立舍甫琴科基辅大学、外国语师范学院和别的高等学校的学生也在学中文。
