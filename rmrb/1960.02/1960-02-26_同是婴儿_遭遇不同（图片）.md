Same Infants, Different Fates

    On October 1, 1959, Houlova, a female member of an agricultural production cooperative near Prague, Czechoslovakia, gave birth to quadruplets (two boys and two girls). After learning the news, the Party and the government immediately provided the mother and the infants with all kinds of care and assistance. On November 1, the government awarded Houlova the First Class Motherhood Medal. The above picture shows Houlova and her four children.

    Recently, in Newcastle, England, a 38-year-old mother named Ada Cummins announced that she was willing to trade her newborn baby for a house. It turned out that she and her husband (a small clerk) and seven children lived in a crowded house. Cummins said: "We, like all mothers in the world, love our children more than anything, but in order for the rest of the children to survive, we can only sacrifice the youngest baby." Soon after, a baby-for-room transaction was completed. The picture on the left shows Cummins and her baby who is about to be separated from her.

    同是婴儿　遭遇不同
    一九五九年十月一日，捷克斯洛伐克布拉格附近一个农业生产合作社的女社员霍乌洛娃一胎生了四个孩子（二男二女），党和政府得到消息后，立即给予母亲和婴儿以种种照顾和帮助。政府并在十一月一日授予霍乌洛娃以一级母亲勋章。上图为霍乌洛娃和她的四个孩子。
    最近，英国纽卡塞地方，有一位年三十八岁的母亲阿达·康敏斯宣布，她愿意把她生下的婴儿拿出去交换一间房子。原来她和她丈夫（一个小职员）以及七个孩子同住在一间拥挤不堪的房子里。康敏斯说：“我们，像世界上所有的母亲一样，爱自己的儿女甚于一切，但是为了让其余的孩子能活下去，只能牺牲最小的一个婴儿。”过不久，一场婴儿交换房间的交易就成交了。左图为康敏斯和她的即将分离的婴儿。
