　　"Mazowsze" -- Mentioning this beautiful name, we will immediately think of those unforgettable songs -- "Little Cuckoo", "Under the Pine Tree", "Bachelor", "Sun, Set Soon", "Little Bird", etc. "Mazowsze" is the flower of the Polish people, the pride of the Polish people. How fortunate we are to be able to warmly welcome you again. You once left an eternally fresh and beautiful impression on the cultural life of the Chinese people. We sincerely congratulate you on creating newer and higher artistic achievements in the years we have been apart.

　　It seems like eight years ago: It was in the early winter of 1951, I heard the fascinating songs of "Mazowsze" for the first time in Karolin near Warsaw. Although this time it was a relatively free performance at a social gathering, the charm of the "Mazowsze" artists lies in its simplicity, naturalness, and strong sense of life; on the other hand, it is also full of originality and novel artistic style, which deeply touches people with its vibrant vitality at first contact. The creations of this group of young artists from the vast rural areas of People's Poland symbolize the prosperity and flourishing of culture and art in the socialist era.

　　As time flies, socialist countries are leaping forward at high speed, and cultural and artistic undertakings are also developing rapidly. The second visit of the Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble to our country has given me the fourth opportunity to appreciate their perfect creations in song and dance art, which are advancing by leaps and bounds. What they show to our audience is a colorful picture of the life of the Polish people with singing and dancing. "Mazowsze" has created a complete and coherent form of song and dance art performance. Music, singing, folk costumes, and dance are combined into a complete artistic image. The programs are connected one after another, with dance in the songs and songs in the dance, allowing people's imagination to unknowingly walk out of the theater and fly to the ocean of life, which is far away but close at hand.

　　The young singers of "Mazowsze" have created amazing achievements in developing the folk school of choral art. The folk choral school seems to be an ancient and long-standing tradition, but it is actually a rising star. In the era when capitalist art was flourishing, folk choirs were forgotten wanderers; only in the socialist era can folk choirs sprout new and strong seedlings in the vast free soil, and its growth is leaping forward at a rate that surpasses a century in a year. The achievements of "Mazowsze" in choral art eloquently embody such a truth. Never in history have people living in the socialist era loved their own artistic traditions so much, and been so good at excavating the most outstanding folk songs with profound popular appeal, and endowing these songs with the beautiful qualities of character and emotion that people in the new era possess.

　　Speaking of this, we cannot but pay high tribute to the late outstanding contemporary composer and outstanding folk music connoisseur of People's Poland, Tadeusz Sygietyński. The glorious achievements of the "Mazowsze" song and dance art are inseparable from Sygietyński's great wisdom and labor devoted to this cause. Sygietyński once humbly said: These songs were not written by myself, but created with the entire song and dance troupe. This sentence indeed contains a profound truth, and his creative labor is the concentrated embodiment of the vast popular wisdom.

　　The band music, with its clear image and simple style, appropriately and harmoniously becomes a component of the song and dance art. Like the chorus, it has such a wide range of artistic expression. The rural band, with its unique humorous image and genre-specific tones, enriches the vividness of the band music.

　　The content and style of "Mazowsze" art are becoming more and more diverse, the repertoire covers a wider and wider area, and the professional skills are becoming more and more sophisticated. However, in faithfully preserving the excellent qualities of folk art and in enhancing the life-infecting power of artistic performances, it has adhered to its unique artistic style for ten years as if it were a day, that is, it is not subject to the encroachment of certain professional stage airs at all, and maintains an extremely close connection between life and art. This is an extremely valuable quality of "Mazowsze" on the road of artistic development.

　　Let us cheer for the newer and more beautiful brilliance emitted by the flower of People's Poland -- "Mazowsze"! Let us cheer for the prosperity of folk song and dance art in the socialist era!

    载歌载舞  清新优美

    “玛佐夫舍”——提起这美丽的名字，我们就会立刻想起了那些久久令人难忘的歌声——“小杜鹃”、“在松树下”、“单身汉”、“太阳你快下山吧”，“小鸟”等等。“玛佐夫舍”是波兰人民的花朵，是波兰人民的骄傲。我们多么幸福地能够又一次热情地欢迎你，你曾经在中国人民的文化生活中，留下了永远清新，永远美丽的印象，让我们衷心地祝贺你在我们别离的几年中，又创造了更新更高的艺术成就。
    算起来已经是八年以前的事情了：那是1951年的初冬，我在华沙城附近的卡罗林，第一次听到了“玛佐夫舍”的令人神往的歌曲。虽然这一次是在一个联欢会上比较自由的表演，但“玛佐夫舍”艺术家们的魅力就在她一方面是纯朴、自然而具有强烈的生活气息；另一方面又是富于独创性的、新颖的艺术风格，使人一接触就深深地为那充沛生命力的蓬勃朝气所感动。这一群来自人民波兰广大农村的年青一代的艺术家们的创造，正象征着社会主义时代文化艺术的繁荣和兴旺。
    随着岁月的奔驰，社会主义国家正以高速度向前跃进，文化艺术事业也在飞跃地发展。玛佐夫舍歌舞团第二次光临我们的国家，使我得到第四次的机会，来欣赏她们在歌舞艺术上正以巨大步伐前进着的完美的创造。她们展示在我国观众面前的，是一幅载歌载舞，色彩缤纷的波兰人民的生活图画。“玛佐夫舍”创造了完整的、一气呵成的歌舞艺术的演出形式，音乐、歌唱、民间服饰和舞蹈结合成一个完整的艺术形象，节目一个衔接着一个，歌中有舞、舞中有歌，使人们的想像在不知不觉中走出了剧院，飞向那远在万里而又近在眼前的生活的海洋。
    “玛佐夫舍”的年青歌手们，在发展民间学派的合唱艺术上，创造了令人惊叹不止的成就。民间合唱学派看来好像是一个古老的、悠久的传统，而实际上却是后起之秀，在资本主义艺术兴旺的年代中，民间合唱是一个被遗忘了的流浪儿；只有在社会主义时代，民间合唱才得以在广大自由的土壤中发出新生而又茁壮的幼芽来，而她的成长是以一年胜过一世纪的速度飞跃前进。“玛佐夫舍”在合唱艺术上的成就，正是雄辩地体现着这样一个真理。历史上从来没有像生活在社会主义时代的人们，这样热爱人民自己的艺术传统，这样善于把最优秀的、富有深刻人民性的民间歌曲发掘出来，并赋予这些歌曲以新时代人所具有的性格上、感情上的优美品质。
    谈到这里，我们不能不向人民波兰已故的当代杰出的作曲家、卓越的民间音乐鉴赏家塔·塞格廷斯基表示崇高的敬意。“玛佐夫舍”歌舞艺术的光辉成就和塞格廷斯基在这个事业上所付出的巨大的智慧和劳动是分不开的。塞格廷斯基虽曾谦虚地说过：这些歌曲不是我自己写的，而是跟整个歌舞团一起创作出来的。这句话的确是包含了深刻的真理，他的创造性的劳动，是广大的人民智慧的集中体现。
    乐队音乐以它明了的形象和质朴的风格，十分得体而又相得益彰地成为歌舞艺术的组成部分。它和合唱一样具有如此丰富多采的艺术表现的宽广幅度。农村乐队以其特有的幽默形象和风俗性的音调，丰富了乐队音乐的生动性。
    “玛佐夫舍”艺术的内容和风格的越来越多样，保留节目包括的地区越来越宽广，专业技巧也越来越精湛，然而在忠实地保留民间艺术的优秀品质上，在提高艺术表演的生活感染力上，却是十年如一日地坚持着自己特有的艺术作风，——那。就是丝毫不受某些专业性的舞台腔的侵袭，保持着生活和艺术的极其亲密的联系。这是“玛佐夫舍”在艺术发展的道路上极其可贵的品格。
    让我们为人民波兰的花朵——“玛佐夫舍”所散发出来的更新更美的光彩而欢呼吧！让我们为社会主义时代民间歌舞艺术的繁荣而欢呼吧！
