Strive Forward for Continued Leap Forward This Year

Ye Fei, First Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

In 1959, under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, the people of Fujian Province, holding high the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, rode the east wind, mustered their energy, and advanced courageously. Building on the foundation of the extraordinary leap forward in 1958, they achieved another comprehensive leap forward victory in socialist construction.

In 1959, the development speed of Fujian Province's national economy exceeded that of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. In that year, agricultural development was unprecedented, with a total agricultural output value increasing by 29% compared to 1958, and total grain output increasing by 21.6% compared to 1958, achieving the targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. 450,000 mu of high-yield fields with a per-mu yield of over 1,000 jin of rice emerged. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries all overfulfilled the leap forward plan, realizing a comprehensive leap forward in agriculture with grain as the key. In that year, the total industrial output value increased by 55%, light industry increased by 41%, and heavy industry increased by 73%, completing the output targets of major products in the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. Basic construction also developed at a high speed. Among the 37 projects above the quota limit, 19 were fully or partially completed and put into production. More than 2,078 projects below the quota limit were undertaken by counties and above, of which 1,458 were completed. The completed investment amount increased by 57% compared to 1958 (excluding railways). Now, Fujian Province not only has thousands of small and medium-sized factories and mines, with commune-run industries blooming everywhere, but also has a batch of modern iron and steel, chemical, power, and machinery industries, as well as a batch of modern forestry chemical, sugar, and paper industries. This has further changed the backward face of Fujian Province's industry and begun to establish a modern industrial foundation. With the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production and construction, the living standards of urban and rural people have also gradually improved. Compared with 1958, the total wage bill of employees increased by 25%, the average income of farmers increased by 12%, and the total retail sales of social commodities increased by 17.5%. In that year, education also achieved a leap forward development. General education, vocational education, spare-time education, and literacy campaigns all completed the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. The province has basically established a relatively complete system of education of various types and at all levels. We resolutely implemented the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, greatly improving the quality of education and making Fujian Province's general education enter the advanced ranks of the country. In that year, scientific and technological undertakings also made great progress. All cities and most people's communes have established scientific research institutions. Mass scientific research and professional scientific research have achieved preliminary results, breaking the superstition of scientific mystery, and climbing the peak of science has become the goal of struggle for the broad masses.

The high-speed development of agriculture, light industry, heavy industry, and various socialist construction undertakings fully demonstrates that the Party's General Line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism" and a series of "walking on two legs" policies are completely correct, solving the fundamental problem of high-speed and proportional development of socialist economic construction. The high speed of our socialist economic construction is a Great Leap Forward-style high speed, and this Great Leap Forward is a continuous Great Leap Forward, a long-term Great Leap Forward. Facts have proved that this Great Leap Forward-style high speed is precisely proportional development. If it were not proportional, there could not be such a high speed. Therefore, high speed itself contains the proportional relationship that adapts to it. Some people completely oppose or separate high speed and proportionality, believing that high speed is impossible to be proportional, or even destroys proportional development. This view is obviously wrong and is a metaphysical viewpoint. The essence of people who hold this view is that they are absolute equilibrium theorists. They regard equilibrium as absolute and fixed. Our point of view is the opposite of theirs. We believe that equilibrium is relative, imbalance is absolute, things are moving and developing, not static. Equilibrium is often broken, turning into imbalance, and then reaching a new equilibrium on a new basis. This is the law of the development of things. The proportional relationship of the national economy is also from equilibrium to imbalance, and then to a new equilibrium, which is not fixed. We cannot compromise backwardness in order to seek equilibrium, but rather establish new proportional relationships and reach new equilibrium in high-speed advance. The high-speed, proportional Great Leap Forward is the brilliant victory of Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of Chinese socialist construction, and is a new development of Marxism-Leninism in socialist construction.

In the past year, the People's Communes have embarked on a path of consolidated, sound development, demonstrating unparalleled superiority in organizing mass production and life. People's Communes are not only able to carry out larger-scale agricultural capital construction such as farmland water conservancy, soil improvement, and gardenification than advanced agricultural production cooperatives, but also ensure the comprehensive leap forward of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries in the event of severe wind and flood disasters, allowing one-third of teams with poorer economic foundations to catch up with those with better economic foundations; and guaranteeing increased income for over 90% of commune members. The People's Communes have implemented a distribution system combining wages and supply, which not only implements the socialist principle of distribution according to work, but also realizes the most universal and reliable social insurance. The People's Communes have established collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, and homes for the elderly, which has greatly changed the economic and spiritual outlook of the countryside. The People's Communes have also established a batch of commune-run factories, farms, forest farms, livestock farms, hydropower stations, hydroelectric power stations, and tractor stations, and other enterprises, and the commune-owned economy is developing. Although the People's Communes have only been established for a short period of over a year, their characteristics of "larger size and higher degree of public ownership" and their great vitality have been clearly demonstrated. In the future, they will increasingly demonstrate their superiority, especially in completing the historical task of agricultural mechanization.

The mass movement of comprehensive leap forward in socialist construction is also a great ideological movement of socialism and communism. In the two years of earth-shaking Great Leap Forward, people held high the glorious banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, emancipated their minds, broke down superstitions, and promoted the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, improved the communist spirit of selflessness, swept away all kinds of right-leaning conservative thoughts, and ensured the smooth development of construction undertakings. The Party's General Line for socialist construction, the development speed of the national economic Great Leap Forward, and the social grassroots organizational form of the People's Commune are our three magic weapons for building socialism in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way, and are the products of Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of China's construction. With them, we can more fully mobilize the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people, eliminate all obstacles and difficulties on the road forward, and ensure the continuous and long-term Great Leap Forward of our socialist construction. The victory of 1959 is the victory of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, the victory of the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and the victory of the revolutionary mass movement throughout the province, and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

The victory of 1959 has created unprecedentedly favorable political, organizational, and material conditions for the continued Great Leap Forward this year, paving the way for victorious advancement. We must advance along this victorious road by leaps and bounds, under the glorious light of the Party's General Line, and under the guidance of the fundamental policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, further implement the principle of taking agriculture as the foundation and combining agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry to promote each other, and realize the continued Great Leap Forward of socialist construction in Fujian Province in 1960.

To achieve the continued Great Leap Forward in socialist construction in 1960, it is still necessary to take grain as the key and comprehensively develop agricultural production. Agriculture is the foundation for the development of the national economy. With the development of agriculture, not only light industry and heavy industry will be easier to manage, but all economic work will be easier to manage. Therefore, accelerating the development of agriculture is the central link in the high-speed, proportional development of the socialist economy. Whether in the past or now, the agricultural issue is the most important issue. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "Our country is a large agricultural country, with the rural population accounting for more than 80% of the national population. The development of industry must go hand in hand with the development of agriculture. Only then can industry have raw materials and markets, and only then can it be possible to accumulate more funds for the establishment of a strong heavy industry. Everyone knows that light industry and agriculture have a very close relationship. Without agriculture, there would be no light industry. The point that heavy industry needs to take agriculture as an important market is not yet very clear to people. However, with the gradual development of agricultural technological reform and the increasing modernization of agriculture, the machinery, fertilizers, water conservancy construction, power construction, transportation construction, civilian fuel, civilian building materials, etc. serving agriculture will gradually increase, and the situation in which heavy industry takes agriculture as an important market will be easily understood by people. During the Second Five-Year Plan and the Third Five-Year Plan, if our agriculture can have greater development and light industry can have more corresponding development, this will be beneficial to the entire national economy, and heavy industry has markets and funds, it will develop faster. In this way, the speed of industrialization may seem slower, but in reality, it will not be slow, or it may even be faster." Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant judgment on the relationship between agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry is completely correct.

Grain is the foundation of agriculture. Steadfastly developing grain production is of paramount importance, both in the past and in the future. Although Fujian Province's grain production has made great progress since liberation, with the grain output in 1959 increasing by nearly two times compared to 1949, transforming it from a grain-deficient province to a grain self-sufficient province, our grain production level is still not high, and the grain issue has not yet "passed the test," and it cannot meet the needs of socialist construction and the continuously improving living standards of the people. Therefore, the entire Party and the entire people need to continue to vigorously develop grain production and strive to completely solve the grain problem in a few years. Fujian Province has very superior natural conditions, and the People's Communes have great potential for developing grain production. With the leadership of the Party and the hard work of the people throughout the province, grain production can completely develop faster. If it is said that last year, under the conditions of severe natural disasters, there emerged many large-area high-yield fields and fourteen grain thousand-jin counties, and the total grain output increased by more than 20%, then this year, with political conditions, organizational conditions, and conditions such as water conservancy, fertilizers, and agricultural production experience and leadership experience being much better than last year, it is entirely possible to increase grain production more than last year and create more large-area high-yield fields than last year.

To rapidly develop grain production, it is necessary to vigorously develop animal husbandry, with pig raising as the main focus. More livestock means more fertilizer; more fertilizer means more crop yields; more crop yields means more feed; more feed means more livestock. It can be seen that crop cultivation and animal husbandry are interdependent and mutually reinforcing, and they must be placed in equal positions and should not be biased. The view that animal husbandry is a sideline has become outdated and should be corrected. Developing animal husbandry must put pig raising in the most important position, which is of great significance. A pig is a small organic fertilizer factory, and this fertilizer factory can be set up everywhere. Therefore, grasping the issue of pig raising fundamentally grasps the key to solving the fertilizer problem in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way. Some comrades regard the policy of raising pigs and accumulating manure as a temporary emergency measure in the case of insufficient chemical fertilizers, which is obviously wrong. Because pig manure is organic fertilizer, it is not only the best fertilizer, but also can improve the soil. Even if the chemical industry develops in the future and can supply chemical fertilizers, pig manure is still the best fertilizer. Therefore, our policy for solving the fertilizer problem is: organic fertilizer (manure and green manure) as the main focus, and inorganic fertilizer (chemical fertilizer) as a supplement. The development of pig raising can also solve the supply of meat and ensure the raw materials for light industry. The pig raising movement launched in November last year increased the number of pigs raised in the province by 31% and the number of sows by more than 160% in just two months. Now, there are more than one million sows in the province. This fact powerfully illustrates that pig raising can also achieve a Great Leap Forward. As long as we steadfastly focus on pig production and launch a mass movement for pig raising, we are fully capable of striving to achieve an average of one pig per person or one pig per mu throughout the province in a few years. In the large-scale development of pig raising, we must pay attention to using the advantageous condition of Fujian Province being mountainous, using mountain slopes and foothills for grazing, planting feed, and building pig pens and chicken coops. This is a good way for Fujian Province to develop animal husbandry in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way, and should be vigorously promoted and actively popularized.

To achieve a comprehensive leap forward in agriculture, with grain as the main focus, it is also necessary to vigorously develop the economy of mountainous areas and develop diversified operations. Fujian Province has a land area of 120,000 square kilometers, and 85% is suitable for forestry. These mountainous areas have thick soil layers and fertile soil, coupled with a mild climate and abundant rainfall, which are very suitable for the development of trees and economic crops such as fruits, oil tea, and tea. Fir trees can mature in 20 years. In the southern region, it is also suitable for the growth of subtropical crops, and there is great potential for developing diversified economies. In the Great Leap Forward last year, Taiping Commune in Zhao'an County proposed the slogan of marching towards "Wanbao Mountain," to create 10,000 mu of forest, 10,000 mu of bamboo, 10,000 mu of fruit trees, and 10,000 mu of oil tea. Because they fully utilized the superiority of the People's Commune's large organizational scale, wide range of activities, unified use of natural resources, and unified use of human and material resources, they adopted the method of launching a large-scale mass movement, implementing large-scale corps operations combined with specialized teams, reclaiming wasteland, afforesting, and planting fruit trees on more than 63,000 mu, and 90% of the barren mountains have been developed and managed. This is a good experience for the People's Communes to develop mountainous areas on a large scale and develop diversified economies in mountainous areas, and should be rapidly promoted throughout the province. While marching towards the mountainous areas, it is also necessary to march towards the sea and rivers, vigorously develop fisheries and salt production, thereby creating a large amount of wealth for the country, transporting a large amount of raw materials for industry, and strengthening the collective economy of the communes and increasing the income of commune members.

Communalization has created superior conditions for large-scale agricultural production, which requires us to actively carry out agricultural technical transformation from now on and equip our agriculture with new technologies. To complete the historical task of agricultural mechanization, we must go through the process from semi-mechanization to mechanization. The current task is to launch a mass movement for tool reform on a large scale, manufacture a large number of new-style agricultural tools, universally establish rural small-scale hydropower and hydroelectric power stations in all places where conditions permit, and achieve semi-mechanization and mechanization of agricultural product processing, mechanization and electrification of drainage and irrigation, and vehicle and boat transportation. At the same time, implement cultivation mechanization in a planned, focused, batch-by-batch, and phased manner. Industry must resolutely implement the policy of serving agriculture, shoulder the glorious task of supporting agriculture, and supply agriculture with the machinery and equipment and chemical fertilizers and pesticides needed for cultivation, processing, drainage and irrigation, transportation, hydropower, and hydroelectric power, and gradually raise Fujian Province's agriculture to a modern level.

The continuous leap forward in agricultural production has created favorable conditions for the development of light industry. Developing light industry can not only accumulate funds for national construction, but also gradually meet the needs of the people's lives. Since the Great Leap Forward, Fujian Province's light industry has made great progress, and has begun to preliminarily establish a modern light industry base for sugar making, paper making, salt making, and food. We must make full use of Fujian Province's resources, adapt to local conditions, and develop light industry production.

In order to meet the needs of the further upsurge in industry and agriculture, it is necessary to continue to carry out the technical revolution and cultural revolution, and strengthen scientific and technological research work. To build a great socialist country, we must have the strong leadership of the Party, a mass with high political awareness, and scientific and technological talents. All three are indispensable. At present, Fujian Province's science and technology lags behind the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture and is not adapted to the development of the national economy. In order to overcome this weak link, we should greatly strengthen the leadership of scientific and technological work, enrich scientific strength, and establish a scientific team. To develop scientific undertakings, we must implement the policy of combining popularization and improvement, break down superstitions, overthrow the "Jia Gui thinking," and launch a mass movement for scientific research. Historically, scientific inventions have all been produced in labor. The working people have accumulated years of rich production experience and knowledge. Under the leadership of the Party, they are fully capable of mastering science and developing science. Whoever does not believe this is not a true Marxist. Of course, it is also necessary to strengthen professional scientific research work so as to continuously improve on the basis of popularization. Scientific research must serve current production and also consider long-term needs, set ambitious goals, and climb the peak of science.

While accelerating the technical revolution, we must carry out the cultural revolution, vigorously develop cultural, educational, and health undertakings that serve economic construction, and launch a new upsurge of the cultural revolution. To develop Fujian Province's educational undertakings in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way, we must resolutely implement the policy of "walking on two legs," take the mass line, run schools by the whole people, and industrial and mining enterprises, communes, and organs must universally run schools. Continue to develop and improve full-time and part-time schools; secondary school education should continue to strive to improve quality, in order to continuously transport excellent talents to universities, scientific and technological departments, and production departments; develop higher education and secondary technical education to train technical talents for industry, agriculture, and agricultural mechanization. Massively develop spare-time education, and strive to complete the task of eliminating illiteracy this year, and within a few years, enable workers and farmers who have undergone literacy to reach the level of graduating from senior primary school; run agricultural middle schools (including other vocational middle schools) well, so that they can become new-type schools for training intermediate and primary technical talents and strongholds for scientific and technological research. In order to ensure the victorious completion of the above tasks, we must oppose the bourgeois view of "education for education's sake," resolutely implement the Party's education policy and Mao Zedong's educational thought, and combine education, production, and scientific research to promote each other. At the same time, we must carry out mass sports and health movements, eliminate pests and diseases, improve the people's health level; vigorously carry out mass cultural and artistic activities, prosper artistic creation, enliven the cultural life of workers and peasants, and inspire the political enthusiasm and production initiative of the masses.

The political awareness and revolutionary drive of the people are the inexhaustible source of strength for the high-speed advancement of our socialist construction. Fully recognizing the great role of the people and treating the revolutionary mass movement with full enthusiasm is the most important distinction between our proletarian party and proletarian revolutionaries and bourgeois parties and bourgeois revolutionaries. In the movement to increase production and practice economy, we must boldly mobilize the masses, carry out a socialist labor competition of "learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward"; at the same time, we must guide the soaring enthusiasm of the masses to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, implement hard work, practical work, and skillful work, continuously improve labor productivity, continuously improve product quantity and quality, continuously save raw materials and materials, and continuously reduce labor intensity, so that production and construction can continue to develop at a high speed.

The Party is the leader, inspirer, and organizer of the victory of the revolutionary cause. Without the leadership of the Party, there would be nothing. Mao Zedong Thought is the guide to victory. Leaving it means making "left" or right mistakes. The leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Mao Zedong as the head is the most correct leadership, which leads us from victory to victory. Our Party has the most thorough dialectical materialism and historical materialism worldview, and is best at using the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism to guide the practice of our country's revolutionary construction, and constantly enriching and developing Marxism-Leninism in practice. We must earnestly and repeatedly study Mao Zedong Thought, continuously improve the level of socialist and communist ideology, systematically criticize bourgeois ideology, break down the bourgeois worldview, establish the proletarian worldview, be a thorough revolutionary, and at any time adhere to the correct stand of Mao Zedong Thought, hold high the banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and bravely move forward!

    为今年的继续跃进奋勇前进
    中共福建省委第一书记　叶飞
    1959年，福建省人民在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，高举着总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，乘东风，鼓干劲，奋勇前进，在1958年特大跃进的基础上，又取得了社会主义建设全面大跃进的胜利。
    1959年福建省国民经济的发展速度超过了大跃进的1958年。在这一年，农业的发展速度是空前的，农业总产值比1958年增长29％，粮食总产量比1958年增长21．6％，提前三年实现了第二个五年计划的指标，出现了四十五万亩亩产千斤稻的高额丰产田，农、林、牧、副、渔五业都超额完成了跃进规划，实现了以粮为纲的农业全面大跃进。在这一年，工业总产值增长了55％，轻工业增长了41％，重工业增长了73％，提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的主要产品产量指标。基本建设也是高速度地发展着，在三十七个限额以上的工程中，全部或部分建成投入生产的有十九个；县以上兴办的限额以下项目有二千零七十八个，其中建设完工的有一千四百五十八个，已完成的投资额比1958年增长57％（不包括铁路）。现在，福建省不仅有了数以千计的中小型厂矿，社办工业遍地开花，而且有了一批现代化的钢铁、化学、电力和机械工业，有了一批现代化的森林化工、制糖工业和造纸工业。这就进一步改变了福建省工业落后的面貌，开始建立现代化的工业基础。随着工农业生产建设的飞跃发展，城乡人民的生活水平也逐步提高，和1958年相比，职工工资总额增长25％，农民平均收入增长12％，社会商品零售总额增长17．5％。在这一年，教育事业也得到了飞跃的发展，普通教育、职业教育、业余教育和扫除文盲，均提前三年完成了第二个五年计划，全省已基本建成一套比较完整的各类各级教育的体系。我们坚决贯彻了党的教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，大大提高了教育质量，使福建省的普通教育进入了全国的先进行列。在这一年科学技术事业也有了很大发展，所有城市和大多数人民公社已建立了科学研究机构，群众性的科学研究和专业的科学研究已获得初步成果；打破了科学神秘的迷信，攀登科学高峰已成为广大群众的奋斗目标。
    农业、轻工业、重工业和各项社会主义建设事业这种高速度的发展，充分显示了党的“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线和一系列“两条腿走路”的方针是完全正确的，解决了社会主义经济建设既是高速度又是按比例发展的根本问题。我们社会主义经济建设的高速度，是大跃进式的高速度，而且这种大跃进是连续的大跃进，长期的大跃进。事实证明，这种大跃进式的高速度正是按比例发展的，如果不是按比例，就不可能有这样的高速度。所以说，高速度本身就包含了与之相适应的比例关系。有人把高速度和按比例完全对立起来或是分割开来，认为高速度就不可能按比例，甚至破坏了按比例发展，这种看法显然是错误的，是形而上学的观点。坚持这种观点的人，实质上就是绝对平衡论者。他们把平衡看做是绝对的，固定不变的东西。而我们的观点正和他们相反，我们认为平衡是相对的，不平衡是绝对的，事物是运动的、发展的，不是静止的，平衡经常被突破，变成不平衡，然后又在新的基础上达到新的平衡，这是事物发展的规律。国民经济的比例关系也是由平衡到不平衡、再到新的平衡，不是固定不变的。我们不能因求平衡而迁就落后，而是要在高速度前进中建立新的比例关系，达到新的平衡。高速度按比例的大跃进，这是马克思列宁主义普遍真理和中国社会主义建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的光辉胜利，是马克思列宁主义在社会主义建设中的新发展。
    在过去的一年中，人民公社已走上巩固的健全发展的道路，在组织群众生产和生活中显示了无比的优越性。人民公社不仅能够比高级农业生产合作社进行更大规模的农田水利、改良土壤、园田化等农业基本建设，还能够在特大风水灾害的情况下，保证农、林、牧、副、渔的全面大跃进，使三分之一的经济基础较差的队赶上了经济基础较好的队；并保证了90％以上的社员增加收入。人民公社实行了工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，既贯彻了社会主义按劳分配的原则，又实现了最普遍最可靠的社会保险。人民公社举办了公共食堂、托儿所、敬老院等集体福利事业，这就大大改变了农村的经济面貌和精神面貌。人民公社还兴办了一批社办的工厂、农场、林场、畜牧场、水力站、水电站和拖拉机站及其他企业，社有经济正在发展着。人民公社的诞生虽然只有短短一年多的时间，但是它的“一大二公”的特点及其伟大的生命力，已经明显地表现出来了。今后还将越来越发挥其优越性，尤其在完成农业机械化的历史任务中将更加充分表现出来。
    社会主义建设全面大跃进的群众运动，也是一个伟大的社会主义和共产主义的思想运动。在连续两年翻天复地的大跃进中，人们高举着总路线、大跃进和人民公社的光辉旗帜，解放思想，破除迷信，发扬了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，提高了大公无私的共产主义精神，横扫了各式各样的右倾保守思想，保证了建设事业的顺利发展。党的社会主义建设总路线，国民经济大跃进的发展速度和人民公社这一社会基层组织形式是我们多快好省地建设社会主义的三大法宝，是马克思列宁主义普遍真理和中国的建设具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的产物。有了它，就可以更充分地调动广大人民的社会主义积极性，排除前进道路上的一切障碍和困难，保证我们的社会主义建设事业连续的长期的大跃进。1959年的胜利，是总路线、大跃进、人民公社的胜利，是党中央和毛泽东同志的英明领导和全省革命群众运动的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    1959年的胜利，为今年继续大跃进创造了空前有利的政治条件、组织条件和物质条件，铺平了胜利前进的道路。我们必须沿着这条胜利的道路大步前进，在党的总路线光辉照耀下，在工农业并举的根本方针指导下，进一步贯彻执行以农业为基础、农业、轻工业、重工业互相结合互相促进的原则，实现1960年福建省社会主义建设事业的继续大跃进。
    要实现1960年社会主义建设继续大跃进，仍然要以粮食为纲，全面发展农业生产。农业是发展国民经济的基础。农业发展了，不但轻工业和重工业好办了，一切经济工作都好办了。因此，加快农业的发展，是高速度、按比例发展社会主义经济的中心环节。不论过去和现在，农业问题都是头等重要的问题。毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中说：“我国是一个大农业国，农村人口占全国人口的百分之八十以上，发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举，工业才有原料和市场，才有可能为建立强大的重工业积累较多的资金。大家知道，轻工业和农业有极密切的关系。没有农业，就没有轻工业。重工业要以农业为重要市场这一点，目前还没有使人们看得很清楚。但是随着农业的技术改革逐步发展，农业的日益现代化，为农业服务的机械、肥料、水利建设、电力建设、运输建设、民用燃料、民用建筑材料等等将日益增多，重工业以农业为重要市场的情况，将会易于为人们所理解。在第二个五年计划和第三个五年计划期间，如果我们的农业能够有更大的发展，使轻工业相应地有更多的发展，这对于整个国民经济会有好处。农业和轻工业发展了，重工业有了市场，有了资金，它就会更快地发展。这样，看起来工业化的速度似乎慢一些，但是实际上不会慢，或者反而可能快一些。”毛泽东同志对农业、轻工业和重工业三者关系的英明论断是完全正确的。
    粮食是农业的基础。坚定不移地发展粮食生产，这无论在过去和将来都是具有头等重要的意义。福建省粮食生产在解放以后虽有很大的发展，1959年的粮食产量比1949年增长近两倍，由缺粮省变成粮食自给省，但是我们的粮食生产水平仍是不高的，粮食问题还未“过关”，还不能适应社会主义建设和人民生活不断提高的需要，因此全党全民还需要继续大力发展粮食生产，争取在几年之内完全解决粮食问题。福建省自然条件非常优越，人民公社有发展粮食生产的巨大潜力，加上党的领导和全省人民的艰苦努力，粮食生产完全能够以更快的速度向前发展。如果说，在去年有严重自然灾害的情况下，出现了许多大面积丰产田和十四个粮食千斤县，粮食总产量增长20％多，那么今年，在政治条件、组织条件和水利、肥料等条件以及农业生产经验和领导经验等方面都比去年好得多的情况下，增产比去年更多的粮食，创造比去年更多的大面积丰产田，是完全可能的。
    要迅速地发展粮食生产，就必须大力发展以养猪为主的畜牧业。牲畜多了，肥料就会多；肥料多了，农作物产量就会多；农作物产量多了，饲料就会多；饲料多了，牲畜也就会多。由此可见，种植业和畜牧业是互相依存、互相促进的，必须把它们放到同等的地位，不能有所偏颇。那种把畜牧业当做副业的观点已经过时，应当纠正。发展畜牧业必须把养猪业放在首要地位，这是具有重大意义的。一头猪就是一个小型的有机化肥厂，而这种化肥厂到处都可以办，所以说，抓住了养猪问题，也就从根本上抓住了多快好省地解决肥料问题的关键。有些同志把养猪积肥这一方针性问题，看成是在化肥不足情况下的一种救急的办法，这显然是错误的。因为猪粪肥是有机肥料，它不仅是最好的肥料，而且能够起改良土壤的作用，即使将来化学工业发展了，能够供应化学肥料的时候，猪粪肥仍然是一种最好的肥料。所以我们解决肥料的方针是：有机肥（厩肥和绿肥）为主，无机肥（化肥）为辅。养猪业发展起来，还可以解决肉食的供应，保证轻工业的原料。去年11月掀起的养猪运动，仅两个月的时间，全省养猪头数就增加了31％，母猪增加了160％以上，现在全省共有母猪一百多万头。这一事实有力地说明，养猪业也可以大跃进，只要我们坚定不移地大抓养猪生产，大搞养猪的群众运动，我们完全有可能在几内年争取达到全省平均每人一头猪或每亩地一头猪。在大规模发展养猪事业中必须注意运用福建省多山这一有利条件，利用山坡山脚进行放牧，种植饲料，修建猪栏鸡舍，这是福建省多快好省地发展畜牧业的好办法，应当大力提倡，努力推广。
    实现以粮食为主的农业全面大跃进，还必须大力开发山区经济，发展多种经营。福建省土地面积有十二万平方公里，85％是宜林山地。这些山地土层厚、土质肥沃，加以气候温和、雨量充沛，很适宜于树木和水果、油茶、茶叶等经济作物的发展，杉木二十年即可成材；在南部地区还适合亚热带作物的生长，发展多种经济大有前途。诏安县太平公社在去年大跃进中，提出了向“万宝山”进军的口号，要创造万亩林、万亩竹、万亩果树、万亩油茶。由于他们充分发挥了人民公社组织规模大、活动范围广、统一使用自然资源，统一使用人力物力的优越性，采取大搞群众运动，实行大兵团作战和专业队相结合的办法，开荒造林种果树六万三千多亩，90％的荒山已被开发经营起来。这是人民公社大规模地开发山区，发展山区多种经济的好经验，应当在全省迅速推广。在向山区进军的同时，还要向大海和江河进军，大力发展渔业和盐业生产，从而为国家创造大量财富，为工业输送大量原料，壮大公社集体经济，增加社员收入。
    公社化创造了大规模经营农业生产的优越条件，这就要求我们必须从现在起积极地进行农业技术改造，用新技术来装备我们的农业。我们要完成农业机械化的历史任务，必须经过由半机械化到机械化的过程。当前的任务是应该大搞工具改革的群众运动，大量制造新式农具，在一切有条件的地方，普遍建立农村小型水力、水电站，实现农产品加工半机械化、机械化，排灌机械化、电气化，交通运输车船化。同时有计划、有重点、分批分期地实现耕作机械化。工业要坚决贯彻为农业服务的方针，把支援农业这一光荣任务担当起来，供给农业所需要的耕作、加工、排灌、运输、水力、水电等机械设备和化肥及农药，逐步地把福建省的农业提高到现代化的水平。
    农业生产的不断跃进就为发展轻工业创造了有利的条件。发展轻工业既可为国家建设积累资金，又可以逐步满足人民生活的需要。大跃进以来，福建省轻工业有了很大发展，已经开始初步建立了现代化的制糖、造纸、制盐、食品等轻工业基础。我们必须充分利用福建省的资源，因地制宜，发展轻工业生产。
    为了农业的机械化、电气化和发展轻工业，就要求重工业加速发展，特别是钢铁工业和机械工业，煤炭工业和电力工业。经过几年来的地质勘察工作证实，福建省矿藏资源“多”、“广”、“富”、“全”，水电资源更为丰富。自1958年大炼钢铁以来，福建省已建立起现代化的钢铁、机械、电力、煤炭和化学工业的初步基础，我们完全有信心经过今后几年的努力打下现代基本工业的基础，使重工业更多更好地担负起农业及整个国民经济技术改造的光荣任务。为了完成这个任务，我们必须继续贯彻“以钢为纲”全面发展重工业的方针，加速钢铁工业的发展，积极增产钢、铁和钢材，增加产品品种。发展机械制造工业，积极提高机械工业的水平，以担负比较高级的、大型中型的、精密的设备制造任务；大力发展基本化学和化肥工业；加强煤炭、电力、有色金属、地质勘察等薄弱环节，以适应国民经济继续跃进的需要。发展森林工业，支援国家建设。发展原材料的综合利用，这是多快好省地发展工业的一条重要方针，应该大力提倡推广。今年应首先大力解决木材的综合利用。我们要继续贯彻全国一盘棋，“集中力量，保证重点”的原则，继续贯彻大、中、小并举，中小为主，洋土并举的方针。1958年，我们在大炼钢铁中贯彻了这一方针，洋土并举，不仅迅速结束了福建“手无寸铁”的历史，而且开始建立起现代化的钢铁工业基地。我们在发展木材综合利用中贯彻了这个方针，大办林产化工的“小土群”、“小洋群”、“中洋群”，林产化工事业就得到很大发展，收到了巨大的效果。
    为了适应工业和农业的进一步高涨的需要，必须继续开展技术革命和文化革命，加强科学技术研究工作。建设一个伟大的社会主义国家，要有党的坚强的领导，要有政治觉悟高的群众，还要有科学技术人才，三者缺一不可。目前，福建省科学技术落于工农业大跃进之后，与国民经济的发展不相适应。为了克服这一薄弱环节，应该大大加强对科学技术工作的领导，充实科学力量，建立科学队伍。发展科学事业，要贯彻普及和提高相结合的方针，破除迷信，打倒“贾桂思想”，大搞科学研究的群众运动。历史上的科学发明都是在劳动中产生的，劳动人民有多年积累的丰富的生产经验和知识，他们在党的领导下，完全能够掌握科学、发展科学。谁不相信这一点，谁就不是真正的马克思主义者。当然，还必须加强专业的科学研究工作，以便在普及基础上不断提高。科学研究要为当前生产服务，也要考虑长远的需要，立下雄心大志，攀登科学高峰。
    在加速技术革命的同时，必须进行文化革命，大力发展为经济建设服务的文化教育卫生事业，掀起一个文化革命的新高潮。要多快好省地发展福建省教育事业，必须坚决贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，走群众路线，全民办学，工矿企业、公社和机关都要普遍办学校。继续发展和提高全日制、半日制的学校；中等学校教育应该继续努力提高质量，以便源源不断地为高等学校、科学技术部门和生产部门输送优秀的人才；发展高等教育和中等技术教育，为工业、农业和农业机械化培养技术人才。大量发展业余教育，争取在今年完成扫盲任务，在若干年内使经过扫盲的工人、农民达到高小毕业的程度；办好农业中学（包括其他职业中学），使它成为培养中初级技术人才的新型学校和科学技术研究的据点。为了保证上述任务的胜利完成，必须反对“为教育而教育”的资产阶级观点，坚决贯彻党的教育方针和毛泽东教育思想，教育、生产和科学研究结合起来，互相推动。同时，要开展群众性的体育卫生运动，除害灭病，提高人民健康水平；大力开展群众文化艺术活动，繁荣艺术创作，活跃工农群众文化生活，鼓舞群众的政治热情和生产积极性。
    人民群众的政治觉悟和革命干劲，是我们社会主义建设高速度前进的无穷无尽的力量的源泉。充分认识人民群众的伟大作用，满腔热情地对待革命的群众运动，这是我们无产阶级政党、无产阶级革命家同资产阶级政党、资产阶级革命家最主要的区别。我们在增产节约运动中，必须放手发动群众，开展“学先进、比先进、赶先进、帮后进”的社会主义劳动竞赛；同时，要把群众的冲天干劲引导到大搞技术革新和技术革命上去，实行苦干、实干和巧干，不断地提高劳动生产率，不断地提高产品数量和质量，不断地节约原料和材料，不断地减轻劳动强度，使生产建设持续不断地高速度发展。
    党是革命事业胜利的领导者、鼓舞者和组织者，没有党的领导就没有一切。毛泽东思想是胜利的指南，离开了它就要犯“左”或右的错误。以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的领导，是最正确的领导，它领导我们从胜利走向胜利。我们的党具有最彻底的辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的世界观，最善于运用马克思列宁主义的普遍真理来指导我国的革命建设实践，并在实践中不断地丰富和发展马克思列宁主义。我们必须认真地反复地学习毛泽东思想，不断地提高社会主义和共产主义思想水平，系统地批判资产阶级思想，破除资产阶级的世界观，确立无产阶级的世界观，做一个彻底的革命派，在任何时候都能坚持毛泽东思想的正确立场，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的旗帜，奋勇前进！
