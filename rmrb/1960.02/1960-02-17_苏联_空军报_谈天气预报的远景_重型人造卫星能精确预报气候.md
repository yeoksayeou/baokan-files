    Soviet "Air Force News" Discusses the Prospects of Weather Forecasting
    Heavy Artificial Satellites Can Accurately Predict Climate
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 15th: Heavy artificial earth satellites have opened up brilliant prospects for solving the problem of accurate and long-term weather forecasting. This was stated in an article entitled "Artificial Satellites and Weather" published in the Soviet "Air Force News" on the 9th.
    The article stated that the characteristics of the weather are formed by a series of meteorological factors, including air temperature and humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed and direction, the nature of cloud cover, air visibility and transparency, solar radiation, and so on. In order to determine these factors and judge their development in time and space, meteorologists have established an observation network composed of many weather stations, upper-air weather stations, radiation measurement stations, ozone measurement stations, and so on. However, to date, there are still very large areas on Earth with only a small number of weather stations, and some areas have none at all.
    The article said that the situation is different when using heavy artificial satellites as meteorological observation stations in space. A system composed of three or four artificial satellites can observe the Earth's atmospheric conditions from top to bottom in any space and time. Through heavy artificial satellites, using optical, photographic, film, and television technology, it is possible to determine the meteorological processes occurring in the atmosphere. Not only can weather maps be obtained for a certain time, but also the basic trends of weather development can be determined within our entire globe.

    苏联“空军报”谈天气预报的远景
    重型人造卫星能精确预报气候
    据新华社莫斯科15日电　重型人造地球卫星为解决精确和长时期天气预报问题，打开了光辉的前景。这是苏联“空军报”9日发表的一篇题为“人造卫星和天气”的文章中说的。
    这篇文章说，天气的特征是由一系列的气象因素形成的，这些因素包括空气的温度和湿度、大气的压力、风的速度和方向、云层的性质、空气的能见度和透明度、太阳的辐射等。为了要测定这些因素，并判断它们在时间、空间上的发展，气象学家建立了由许多气象站、高空气象站、辐射测量站，臭氧测量站等组成的观测网。但是，到目前为止，地球上还有很广大地区只有少量气象站，有些地区根本没有。
    文章说，利用重型人造卫星作宇宙中的气象观测站，情况就不同了。用三、四个人造卫星组成的系统，就可以在任何空间和时间，从上向下地观测地球的大气状况。通过重型人造卫星，用光学、照相、电影和电视技术，可以测定大气中发生的气象过程，不仅可以得到某一时间内的天气图，而且还可以确定在我们全地球范围内天气发展的基本趋向。
