Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 31st:  Speaking at the All-Indonesia Peace Consultation Conference in Bandung on January 30th, Wang Mingyuan, the Chinese representative and Deputy Secretary-General of the China Peace Committee, stated that as long as peace-loving people of all countries strengthen their unity, continue their resolute struggle for peace, and further thwart the imperialist plans for arms expansion and war preparation, the international tension can definitely be truly eased, and world peace can be reliably guaranteed.

He asked the conference to convey the Chinese people’s friendship and respect to the Indonesian people. He represented the China Peace Committee in wishing the conference success. He said that this conference demonstrates the Indonesian people’s will to defend peace.

Wang Mingyuan pointed out that the power of the socialist camp is incomparably strong, the surging tide of the Asian, African, and Latin American movements for national independence and democracy is rising, and the peace movement of the people of all countries has formed an overwhelming advantage of peace forces over war forces.

He said that the United States' war and aggression policies, as well as its subversion and intervention activities, have for many years been the greatest threat to peace and security in Asia. He pointed out that in recent months, while paying lip service to peace, the United States has intensified its large-scale arms build-up activities and is currently adjusting and strengthening its strategic deployment worldwide.

He listed the facts and figures of the United States increasing military spending for the development of missiles and the establishment and expansion of missile bases. He said that it is not difficult to see that the American ruling clique intends to use the method of concealing its arms expansion activities with a false peaceful posture to numb the determination of the people of the world to strive for peace, in an attempt to regain its military advantage, and they have not changed their policies of war and aggression at all. He said that this cannot but arouse the serious vigilance of peace-loving people of all countries.

He said that the signing of the Japan-U.S. "Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security" means that Japan has openly joined the United States' aggressive military bloc and the revival of Japanese militarist forces. He further said that this is also an important measure for the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to carry out expansion and aggression preparations in Asia, as well as a challenge to the people of Asian countries. He pointed out the disasters and losses caused by Japanese militarists to the people of Asian countries in the past. He pointed out that the people of Asian countries are now once again facing a real threat from Japanese militarist forces. He said that any conspiracies and tricks by Nobusuke Kishi and American imperialism cannot shake the Chinese people's firm determination to oppose aggressive war. He said that the 650 million Chinese people are determined to completely crush the new conspiracies of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to launch aggression and war, and to defend peace in Asia and the world.

He said that the Chinese people, on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference, have always unswervingly pursued a policy of peace and development of friendship with the people of all other countries. He said that the Chinese people and the Indonesian people have always cooperated and supported each other in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism. The Indonesian people can always count on the full support of the Chinese people in their struggle against imperialism and colonialism and in defense of independence and peace. He pointed out that strengthening the friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people, strengthening their mutual cooperation and support, is not only beneficial to the people of both countries, but also to peace in Asia.

    中国代表王明远在全印度尼西亚和平协商会议上讲话
    美国用和平姿态掩盖扩军活动
    各国人民应继续斗争维护和平
    新华社雅加达1月31日电　出席万隆的全印度尼西亚和平协商会议的中国代表、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副秘书长王明远1月30日在会上讲话时说，只要世界各国爱好和平的人民加强团结，继续进行争取和平的坚决斗争，进一步挫败帝国主义的扩军备战计划，肯定地可以使国际紧张局势真正和缓，使世界和平得到可靠的保障。
    他要求这次会议把中国人民的友谊和敬意带给印度尼西亚人民。他代表中国人民保卫世界和平委员会，祝会议获得成功。他说，这次会议显示印度尼西亚人民保卫和平的意志。
    王明远指出，社会主义阵营的威力无比强大，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲争取民族独立和民主的运动汹涌澎湃的浪潮正在高涨，世界各国人民的和平运动已经形成和平力量对战争力量的压倒优势。
    他说，美国的战争和侵略政策以及它的颠覆和干涉活动多年来一直是亚洲和平和安全的最大威胁。他指出，美国最近几个月来在侈谈和平的同时，加紧进行大规模的加强军备的活动，并且目前正在调整和加强它在全世界的战略部署。
    他列举了美国增加发展导弹以及建立和扩充导弹基地的军事开支的事实和数字。他说，不难看出，美国统治集团打算以假和平姿态掩盖自己的扩军活动的办法来麻痹全世界人民争取和平斗争的决心，以图挽回它的军事优势，而它们根本没有改变战争和侵略政策。他说，这不能不引起世界各国爱好和平人民的严重警惕。
    他说，日美“共同合作和安全条约”的签订意味着日本公开参加了美国的侵略性军事集团和日本军国主义势力的复活。他又说，这也是美日反动派在亚洲进行扩张和侵略准备的重要措施以及对亚洲各国人民的挑战。他指出了日本军国主义者过去给亚洲各国人民造成的灾难和损失。他指出，亚洲各国的人民现在再一次面临日本军国主义势力的真正威胁。他说岸信介和美帝国主义的任何阴谋诡计都不能动摇中国人民反对侵略战争的坚定决心。他说六亿五千万中国人民决心彻底粉碎美日反动派发动侵略和战争的新阴谋，并且保卫亚洲和世界和平。
    他说，中国人民在和平共处的五项原则和万隆会议的十项原则的基础上，始终不渝地奉行着和平和发展同所有其他国家人民的友谊政策。他说，中国人民和印度尼西亚人民在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中一直彼此合作、相互支持。印度尼西亚人民在他们反对帝国主义和殖民主义、保卫独立与和平的斗争中，始终可以指望得到中国人民的充分支持。他指出，加强中国人民和印度尼西亚人民之间的友谊，加强他们之间的相互合作和支持，不仅有利于两国的人民，而且有利于亚洲的和平。
