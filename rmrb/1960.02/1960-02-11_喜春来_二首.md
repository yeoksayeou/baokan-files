*Xi Chun Lai* (Two Poems)
Zhao Puchu

[Written during the Spring Festival visit of the Burmese Cultural Friendship Delegation, when attending a New Year's party at our embassy]

	Through the night, songs and dances captivated all,
	Tens of thousands of miles, the friendship ship brought joy to both nations.
	Gentle breeze and rain brewed a flowery paradise.
	Hearing the bamboo's report,
	Auspicious omens joyfully connect in succession.

	Coconut milk is good, like goose-yellow wine,
	Floral tidings first arrive at Yanzi (Swallow) Lake. (Note)
	Brothers together in joyous events at the ends of the earth.
	Singing of the motherland, the festival is even more joyful.

(Note) Inya Lake in Yangon, literally translated as Swallow Lake, has beautiful scenery.

    喜春来　二首
    赵朴初
    〔春节访缅文化友好代表团同人参加我使馆联欢晚会有作〕
    连宵歌扇倾城赏，
    万里星槎两国欢。
    和风和雨酿花天。
    闻竹报，
    佳兆喜联翩。
    椰浆好当鹅儿酒，
    花信初来燕子湖。（注）
    天涯乐事弟兄俱。
    歌祖国，佳节更欢娱。
    （注）仰光茵雅湖，意译为燕子湖，风景甚美。
