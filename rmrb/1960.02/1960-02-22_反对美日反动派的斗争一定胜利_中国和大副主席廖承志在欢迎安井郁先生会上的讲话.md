Comrades and friends:
　　A year ago, we were pleased to receive our friend, Mr. Yasui Kaoru, director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, to visit our country, and we were honored to have the opportunity to hear his speech on the Japanese movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs and the struggle of the Japanese people against nuclear armament and the revival of militarism. Today, we are again able to welcome Mr. Yasui Kaoru, and at the same time welcome Mr. Yoshida Yoshiharu, Deputy Secretary-General of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. What makes us even happier is that Mr. Yasui Kaoru will once again speak at this gathering. We believe that Mr. Yasui Kaoru's speech will give us a greater and deeper understanding of the struggle of the Japanese people. Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and all the friends present, to extend a warm welcome to Mr. Yasui Kaoru.
　　In the past year, the Japanese people's struggle against nuclear weapons, against the revival of militarism, against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality has developed further and achieved important successes. The Japanese people have formed a broad patriotic and democratic united front in their struggle, and in less than a year, they have carried out eleven vigorous national unified actions against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The powerful struggle of the Japanese people has forcefully exposed the war and aggression schemes of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, dealt a heavy blow to the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, and made important contributions to safeguarding the interests and security of the Japanese nation, opposing the U.S. imperialist policy of nuclear war, and defending the cause of peace in Asia and the world. The Chinese people are pleased with the great achievements made by the Japanese people in their struggle and express their heartfelt respect to the Japanese people who have persevered in their struggle against the war and aggression schemes of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.
　　The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, chaired by Mr. Yasui Kaoru, has been making unremitting efforts for many years to ban nuclear weapons, oppose Japan's nuclear armament, and oppose the U.S. imperialists and Japanese reactionaries' attempts to turn Japan into a U.S. nuclear war base, and has made important contributions. In the broad mass movement against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, together with Japan's democratic and peace organizations and peace-loving Japanese people, actively launched a struggle. The Japanese people, who have suffered from atomic and hydrogen bomb disasters, resolutely do not allow the U.S. imperialists and Japanese reactionaries to lead them down the path of war and suffer the disaster of nuclear weapons again. They know that to oppose nuclear weapons, to oppose Japan becoming a U.S. nuclear weapons base, and to eliminate the threat of nuclear war to the Japanese nation, it is necessary to oppose the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' revival of Japanese militarism and their schemes for aggressive military alliances and preparations for new wars. Now, the Japanese people are further uniting and launching a more powerful and in-depth struggle to prevent the Diet from ratifying the so-called U.S.-Japan "Joint Cooperation and Security Treaty" and to demand the abolition of this treaty. We have learned that the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs has also decided to carry out a broader movement against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," against the militarist system, against equipping the Japanese army with nuclear weapons, against the Kishi Nobusuke government's enactment of reactionary laws to suppress the people, demanding that the United States return Okinawa to Japan, and demanding the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China. On the basis of the great success of the previous five World Conferences Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, this year, the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs has proposed that the "Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Complete Disarmament" be held in Japan in August, the 15th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Chinese people have always deeply sympathized with and resolutely supported the just struggle of the Japanese people, and will continue to resolutely support it in the future. We will also actively support the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Complete Disarmament, as we have done in the past. The Chinese people are willing to work together with the Japanese people and all peace-loving people in the world to make this conference make greater contributions to opposing the U.S. imperialist policy of nuclear war and defending the cause of peace in Asia and the world. The enemies of peace—U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries—are using vicious means such as suppression, division, and sabotage, and are trying their best to obstruct the progress of the Japanese people's just struggle. However, as history has repeatedly proven, any conspiracies and tricks of the reactionaries are doomed to bankruptcy in the face of the people who are united and persist in their heroic struggle. We believe that the struggle of the Japanese people will surely overcome all kinds of difficulties, smash all forms of obstruction and sabotage by U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries, and achieve final victory.
　　The aggressive face of U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries has been more clearly exposed through the signing of the so-called U.S.-Japan "Joint Cooperation and Security Treaty." The U.S. imperialist trick of "fake peace, real war preparations" is also being seen through by more and more people. Now, in the Far East, U.S. imperialism not only continues to occupy South Korea, continues to station troops in Japan, occupies Japan's Okinawa and China's territory of Taiwan, but is also expanding missile bases, strengthening military blocs, conducting provocative military exercises, and preparing for new wars of aggression in these places. The United States has also declared that it will resume nuclear weapons testing at any time. The Japanese reactionaries, in collusion with U.S. imperialism, are also actively strengthening their military forces, stepping up nuclear armament, and test-producing missiles. Recently, Kishi Nobusuke even blatantly clamored in the Japanese Diet that the "Far East region" stipulated in the U.S.-Japan "Joint Cooperation and Security Treaty" includes China's Kinmen and Matsu. The blatant aggressive activities of U.S. imperialism and Kishi Nobusuke's increasingly hostile anti-China clamor and behavior, which threaten peace in the Far East and the world, have aroused great indignation among the Chinese and Japanese people, and have also been met with increasingly strong opposition from the people of Asia and the world. The people of the world are increasingly aware that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of peace. To crush the new aggression and war schemes plotted by U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarists in the Far East is not only the task of the Japanese people, but also the common task of the people of all countries in Asia and the world.
　　We are pleased to point out that no matter how closely U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarists collude, the Japanese people's movement to improve Sino-Japanese relations and demand that the Kishi Nobusuke government immediately change its hostile policy towards China is rising. Not only the working people of Japan, but also intellectuals, business people, and even enlightened people from the Liberal Democratic Party are increasingly joining this movement. The Chinese people wholeheartedly welcome this effort by the Japanese people to promote Sino-Japanese friendship. However, Kishi Nobusuke, seeing the rising movement for Sino-Japanese friendship among the broad masses of the Japanese people, on the one hand, continues to play the trick of double-dealing, and while signing and stepping up preparations for the implementation of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, deliberately disseminates ambiguous statements on the China issue, in an attempt to numb the vigilance of the Japanese people, thinking that Kishi Nobusuke has indeed restrained his unrestrained anti-China remarks; but on the other hand, he viciously spreads rumors, saying that once the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty becomes a reality, the "Chinese Communists" will have no choice but to "soften up and return to friendship with Japan." This is a shameless and malicious slander, and we must head-on refute it.
　　The Chinese people clearly distinguish between the Japanese people and Kishi Nobusuke. This was the case in the past, and it will be the case in the future. The Japanese people are friends of the Chinese people, and they are comrades who resolutely fight the common enemy, U.S. imperialism, through thick and thin. However, Kishi Nobusuke, who follows the United States and is a henchman of Tojo Hideki, and Kishi Nobusuke, who signed the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty with U.S. imperialism, is a common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people. The Chinese people disdain to have any dealings with this blood-stained executioner. We can say it again, please rest assured, Japanese friends: If Kishi Nobusuke and his gang do not abandon their hostile policy towards China and the U.S.-Japan military alliance, the Chinese people are determined to fight them to the end and will never stop.
　　The Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan reactionaries continues to rise. The struggle of the people all over the world against war, for the defense of peace, and for the maintenance of national independence is also developing more widely and vigorously. Any conspiracy activities of U.S. imperialism and all reactionaries cannot reverse their doomed fate. They will inevitably become more and more isolated and will eventually not escape a shameful defeat. The struggle of the people of the world to defend peace will surely continue to advance from victory to new victories. Let us wish the Japanese people's struggle continued development and victory, and let us wish Mr. Yasui Kaoru and the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs make greater contributions to the struggle for Japan's independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, in opposing the U.S. imperialist policy of nuclear war, and in defending the cause of peace in Asia and the world.
　　Now, we welcome Mr. Yasui Kaoru to speak. (The title was added by the editor of this newspaper)

    反对美日反动派的斗争一定胜利
    中国和大副主席廖承志在欢迎安井郁先生会上的讲话同志们、朋友们：
    一年以前，我们曾高兴地接待了我们的朋友、日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁先生来我国访问，并且荣幸地能有机会听到他关于日本禁止原子弹氢弹运动、关于日本人民反对核武装和反对复活军国主义斗争的讲话。今天，我们又能在这里欢迎安井郁先生，同时欢迎日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会事务局次长吉田嘉清先生，更使我们高兴的是，安井郁先生还将在这个集会上再一次讲话。我们相信，安井郁先生的讲话会使我们对日本人民的斗争获得更多更深入的了解。请让我代表中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和到会的全体朋友们，对安井郁先生表示热烈的欢迎。
    一年来，日本人民反对核武器、反对军国主义复活、反对日美“安全条约”和要求独立、民主、和平、中立的斗争有了更大的发展，并且取得了重要的成就。日本人民在斗争中结成了广泛的爱国民主统一战线，在不到一年的时间里，轰轰烈烈地进行了十一次声势浩大的反对日美“安全条约”的全国统一行动。日本人民强大的斗争，有力地揭露了美日反动派的战争侵略阴谋，给予美日反动派以沉重的打击，对维护日本民族利益和安全，对反对美帝国主义的核战争政策、保卫亚洲和世界和平的事业，作出了重要的贡献。中国人民为日本人民在斗争中所取得的巨大成就感到高兴，并对为反对美日反动派战争侵略阴谋而坚持不懈斗争的日本人民，表示衷心的敬意。
    以安井郁先生为理事长的日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会，多年来一直为禁止核武器、反对日本核武装、反对美帝国主义和日本反动派企图变日本为美国核战争基地的阴谋，进行着不懈的努力，并且作出了重要的贡献。在反对日美“安全条约”的广泛的群众运动中，日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会同日本的民主、和平团体和爱好和平的日本人民一道，积极展开了斗争。曾经遭受原子弹氢弹灾害的日本人民，坚决不容许美帝国主义和日本反动派把他们引向战争的道路，重新遭受核武器的灾难。他们知道，要反对核武器，要反对日本变成美国的核武器基地和消除核战争对日本民族的威胁，就必须反对美日反动派复活日本军国主义、反对侵略性军事同盟和准备新战争的阴谋。现在，日本人民正在进一步团结起来，展开着阻止国会批准所谓日美“共同合作和安全条约”并且要求废除这个条约的更加强大和深入的斗争。我们已知道日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会也决定更广泛地进行运动，反对新的日美“安全条约”、反对军国主义体系、反对用核武器装备日本军队、反对岸信介政府制定镇压人民的反动法律、要求美国把冲绳岛归还日本，要求恢复日中邦交。在以往五届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会获得重大成功的基础上，今年，日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会已倡议在广岛和长崎遭受原子弹轰炸十五周年的8月，在日本召开“第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会”。中国人民一向深切同情和坚决支持日本人民的正义斗争，今后仍将继续坚决支持。对于第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会，我们也将像以往一样地予以积极支持。中国人民愿同日本人民和全世界爱好和平的人民共同努力，使这次的大会对反对美帝国主义的核战争政策、保卫亚洲和世界和平的事业，作出更大的贡献。和平的敌人——美帝国主义和日本反动派，正在使用镇压、分裂、破坏等恶毒手段，千方百计地企图阻挠日本人民正义斗争的前进。但是，正如历史所一再证实的那样，在团结起来坚持英勇斗争的人民面前，反动派的任何阴谋诡计都是注定要破产的。我们相信，日本人民的斗争，一定会冲破各种困难，粉碎美帝国主义和日本反动派的各种形式的阻挠和破坏，取得最后的胜利。
    美帝国主义和日本反动派的侵略面目，通过所谓日美“共同合作和安全条约”的签订已更加明显地暴露出来。美帝国主义所玩弄的“假和平、真备战”的手法也正被愈来愈多的人所识破。现在，美帝国主义在远东，不仅仍然占领着南朝鲜，继续在日本驻扎军队，霸占着日本的冲绳岛和我国的领土台湾，并且正在这些地方扩大导弹基地、加强军事集团、进行挑衅性的军事演习、准备新的侵略战争。美国并且宣称要随时恢复核武器试验。日本反动派和美帝国主义相互勾结，也正在积极加强军事力量，加紧核武装并试制导弹。最近，岸信介更公然在日本国会上叫嚷日美“共同合作和安全条约”所规定的“远东地区范围”包括到中国的金门、马祖。美帝国主义露骨的侵略活动和岸信介这种变本加厉地敌视中国威胁远东和世界和平的叫嚣和行为，更激起中国人民和日本人民的极大的愤慨，也遭到亚洲以及世界各国人民的日益强烈的反对。全世界人民愈来愈清楚地认识到，美帝国主义是和平的最凶恶的敌人。粉碎美帝国主义和日本军国主义分子在远东策划新的侵略和战争阴谋，不仅是日本人民的任务，也是全亚洲、全世界各国人民的共同任务。
    我们高兴地指出，不管美帝国主义和日本军国主义分子怎样地加紧勾结在一起，但是日本人民要求改善中日关系，要求岸信介政府立即改变敌视中国政策的运动，却日益高涨，不仅日本的劳动人民大众，而且知识分子，企业界人士，甚至自由民主党的有识之士也越来越多地投进这运动中来。中国人民衷心地欢迎日本人民的这一努力促进中日友好的行动。但是，岸信介看见了日本广大人民的日益高涨的促进中日友好运动，于是一方面依旧玩弄两面三刀的手法，在签订并加紧准备实施日美军事同盟条约的同时，对中国问题故意散播模棱两可的说法，以企图麻痹日本人民的警惕，以为岸信介果然把放肆的敌视中国言论收敛了一些；可是另一方面，又毒辣地散布谣言，说日本和美国的军事同盟条约一旦成为事实，“中共”也就没有办法了，实际上中国一定要“软下来和日本重归于好”的。这是无耻而恶毒的诬蔑，我们必须迎头加以驳斥。
    中国人民是把日本人民和岸信介明确地区别开来的，过去如此，今后亦然。日本人民是中国人民的朋友，是向共同敌人美帝国主义坚决作战的患难之交。但是，追随美国的、东条英机的帮凶岸信介，和美国帝国主义签订日美军事同盟条约的岸信介，是中国人民和日本人民共同的敌人，对付这种沾满鲜血的刽子手，中国人民是不屑与之打任何交道的。我们可以再讲一遍，请日本的朋友们放心：岸信介及其一伙如果不放弃敌视中国的政策和日美军事同盟，中国人民是坚决向他们斗争到底，绝不歇气的。
    日本人民反对美日反动派的斗争在继续高涨。全世界人民反对战争，保卫和平和维护民族独立的斗争也正在更广泛和蓬勃地向前发展。美帝国主义和一切反动派的任何阴谋活动，都无法挽回他们已注定的命运。它们必将愈来愈孤立，而终将逃不脱可耻的失败。全世界人民保卫和平的斗争，必将从胜利继续走向新的胜利。让我们预祝日本人民斗争的不断发展和胜利，让我们预祝安井郁先生和日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会在争取日本的独立、民主、和平、中立的斗争中，在反对美帝国主义核战争政策、保卫亚洲和世界和平事业中，作出更大的贡献。
    现在，我们欢迎安井郁先生讲话。　（标题是本报编者加的）
