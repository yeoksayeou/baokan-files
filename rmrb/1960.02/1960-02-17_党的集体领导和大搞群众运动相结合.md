Combining the Party's Collective Leadership with Vigorously Launching Mass Movements
	Sun Yiming, Secretary of the CPC Tianjin Tractor Manufacturing Plant Committee

	In 1958 and 1959, our plant continuously achieved comprehensive great leaps forward. The total output value in 1958 doubled that of 1957, and in 1959 it increased by 25% compared to 1958. The fundamental reason for our victory is that we have consistently implemented the policy of combining the Party's collective leadership with vigorously launching mass movements.

	Adhere to Putting Politics in Command and Strengthening the Party's Collective Leadership

	It is of paramount importance to establish the idea that the Party must lead everything and is capable of leading everything among all employees, especially among leaders at all levels. In recent years, we have systematically conducted political and ideological education on the Party's leadership for our employees, constantly overcoming tendencies to disrespect the Party's leadership, so that the idea of the Party's absolute leadership is firmly established among all cadres and employees. This has laid a fundamental political and ideological foundation for implementing the Party's instructions, resolutions, guidelines, and policies.

	Collective leadership is the fundamental principle of the Party's leadership. Therefore, major issues in the enterprise must be collectively discussed and decided by the Party committee. The Party must lead everything, but it cannot grasp everything regardless of the size, importance, or urgency of the matter. According to our experience, issues such as the implementation of the Party's guidelines and policies, the enterprise's production plans, technical planning, major technical measures, capital construction, long-term plans, important reforms of labor organization, changes in important rules and regulations, central tasks, various campaigns, overall arrangements for various tasks in a period, major expenditures, the investigation and handling of major personal, machine, and economic accidents, the appointment and removal of key cadres, etc., are all major issues and should be discussed and decided by the Party committee. However, the distinction between major and minor issues is not fixed, and they transform into each other under certain conditions; unexpected major issues often arise; and sometimes it is difficult to distinguish between major and minor issues. Therefore, the Party committee discusses whatever it deems necessary, without any restrictions. Each committee member and department leader should not think that the Party committee can only grasp major issues and cannot be concerned with minor matters.

	To ensure the Party committee's collective leadership, there must be a sound meeting system, and individual exchanges of opinions, circulation of written materials, or signing should not be used to replace collective discussions by the Party committee. Of course, individual exchanges of opinions and circulation of written materials are absolutely necessary for major issues, but this should only be to prepare for the Party committee meeting. Another important issue in carrying out collective leadership is to continuously improve the quality of meetings, so that the meetings are short, the discussions are mature, and the decisions are correct. To achieve this, it is necessary to prepare fully before the meeting. Comprehensive issues should first be considered by the secretary; major issues of departments should be considered by the responsible departments first. Full consideration and exchange of opinions should be made before the meeting, and written materials should be printed and distributed to each committee member when necessary. No more than one or two main issues should be discussed at each meeting. Full democracy should be promoted at the meeting, and everyone must be allowed to speak freely, and different opinions should be allowed, preventing indiscriminate labeling. Issues on which opinions are inconsistent or immature should be postponed for conclusion, and considered and studied again after the meeting, and discussed again at the next meeting; after repeated study and consideration, consensus will always be reached.

	The fundamental key to ensuring the Party's collective leadership is the unity of the Party committee, especially the unity between the secretary and the factory director. We had problems with unity in the past. In the past two years, after the great rectification campaign and several summaries of the Party's leadership experience, we are now completely united under the Party's principles. Our basic experience is: no personal decisions are made on major issues, the work assigned to committee members is the task assigned by the Party, and everyone is responsible to the Party committee and cannot regard their assigned scope as an independent kingdom. Each committee member must conscientiously report the situation to the Party committee, resolutely implement the Party committee's decisions, and report on their implementation. When conducting criticism and self-criticism on erroneous ideas in Party committee meetings and Party group meetings, be both serious and gentle. Committee members frequently exchange opinions, talk to each other, and help each other; do not gossip behind their backs, and avoid liberalism. Therefore, everyone has consistent thoughts, consistent actions, a comfortable mood, a happy spirit, and works with full enthusiasm.

	The Party's Collective Leadership Must Be Combined with Vigorously Launching Mass Movements

	The wisdom of the Party's collective leadership comes from the broad masses, and the decisions of the Party's collective leadership are the crystallization of the wisdom of the broad masses. Without the opinions and wisdom of the broad masses, and divorced from objective practice, the Party's collective leadership is empty. Therefore, the Party's collective leadership must be built on the foundation of the mass line.

	The mass line is the Party's fundamental line and the fundamental method for realizing the comprehensive great leap forward. To implement the mass line, it is necessary to vigorously launch mass movements, not just small-scale mass movements. Only by vigorously launching mass movements can the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses be fully developed, and can production be promoted to leap forward. Vigorously launching mass movements must also have the Party's strong leadership. Without the Party's strong leadership, mass movements are blind, unorganized, scattered, and weak, and therefore cannot achieve ideal results. Only by strengthening the Party's leadership, grasping the direction, focus, and form of the movement, can the mass movement develop correctly, healthily, and purposefully.

	Since the Party's collective leadership is built on the foundation of the mass line, how the Party connects with the masses and how to strengthen the relationship between the Party and the masses becomes a very important issue. The Party has many ways to connect with the masses, and we mainly use the following methods:

	(1) Leading cadres eat, live, and work with the masses.
	(2) Hold various forums regularly. At the meeting, listen to the advanced and correct reflections, and patiently listen to the backward and wrong opinions.
	(3) Report meetings of leaders of various departments and units. Such meetings are held in a timely manner after each central task is issued and each movement is launched. At the meeting, listen to the opinions of the leaders of various departments and units, reflect and study the activities of the masses, and determine the next steps.
	(4) The Party committee conducts in-depth research and experimentation on key issues, gains experience, and promotes general applications.
	(5) Convene employee representative conferences regularly.
	(6) Organize visits, evaluations, and on-site meetings.
	(7) Organize forces to inspect work. Sometimes mobilize the masses to conduct comprehensive inspections, and sometimes conduct local and focused inspections, to understand the implementation of the Party's guidelines and policies and the decisions and instructions of the Party committee; to understand the reflections of the masses on production, ideology, work, and life, and to find and solve problems in a timely manner.

	The Party's Specific Leadership of Mass Movements

	A factory is a production unit, and its fundamental task is to develop production. Therefore, the mass movements carried out by the factory are mainly movements that directly serve production. That is, the most frequently launched is the production movement. Of course, there are also movements of other natures, but they must be based on production and carried out around production. It is wrong to launch mass movements in isolation from production.

	To develop production at high speed, it is necessary to rely on the idea of continuous revolution and continuously launch mass movements. Therefore, one of the important tasks of the Party committee's collective leadership is to consider the content and requirements of the next movement while launching this movement; to summarize the experience of this movement, and organize and launch the next movement. We launched many large-scale mass movements last year. At the beginning of last year, in response to certain chaotic phenomena in production and some existing problems, we mobilized the masses to speak out freely and put forward more than 20,000 opinions. The Party committee analyzed and studied these opinions and believed that the main problems were that the planning management was clueless, no one was responsible for technical management, financial work was chaotic, and the technical level was low. Therefore, according to the needs of production and the demands of the masses, a decision was made to return to the masses in a planned and step-by-step manner. From January to March, the focus was on rectifying planning management and establishing and improving a set of planning management systems; from March to May, the focus was on rectifying technical management systems; from May to June, the focus was on rectifying financial cost systems; from July to November, the focus was on carrying out the tractor technical improvement movement. At the same time, high-yield movements were organized every month. Facts have proved that these movements were a major guarantee for us to complete the plan ahead of schedule last year.

	Implement the Factory Director Responsibility System under the Leadership of the Party Committee and Give Play to the Role of the Trade Union and the Communist Youth League

	The administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League are important departments under the leadership of the Party committee, powerful assistants of the Party committee, and the main forces in vigorously launching mass movements. Their roles must be fully utilized.

	The Party committee's leadership over the administration is absolute. Sometimes it is necessary for the Party committee to directly take charge of certain administrative tasks. The amount of administrative work the Party committee manages is not an issue that the factory director should be concerned about. However, in the absence of special necessity, the factory director should be responsible for handling all administrative tasks. The Party committee should pay attention to giving play to the active role of the administration and encourage the factory director to be bold in taking responsibility for administrative work. When the Party committee handles administrative work, it should involve relevant factory directors. One method is for the Party committee to handle it directly, and another method is to handle it through the factory director; the latter should be the main method.

	The trade union and the Communist Youth League bear particularly important tasks in vigorously launching mass movements, organizing competitions, summarizing and promoting advanced experiences, organizing employee learning, conducting political and ideological education, and caring for employee life. Therefore, the Party committee should strengthen its daily leadership over the trade union and the Communist Youth League and give full play to the initiative of these organizations.

	Strive for Continued Great Leap Forward This Year

	In 1960, our plant bears two glorious and arduous tasks. First, on the basis of the comprehensive great leap forward in 1959, the output of tractors will be increased more than threefold, and the quality will be continuously improved, costs will be reduced, and labor productivity will be improved. Second, we must complete the large-scale expansion task to create conditions for the mass production of tractors. Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we must continue to resolutely hold high the red banner of the General Line, adhere to putting politics in command, strengthen the Party's collective leadership, and vigorously launch mass movements centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, to ensure the complete fulfillment of these two tasks and achieve continued leap forward this year.

    党的集体领导和大搞群众运动相结合
    中共天津拖拉机制造厂委员会书记　孙一明
    1958年和1959年，我厂连续实现了全面的大跃进。1958年的总产值比1957年增长一倍，1959年又比1958年增长了25％。我们取得这个胜利的根本原因，是由于始终贯彻执行了党的集体领导与大搞群众运动相结合的方针。
    坚持政治挂帅加强党的集体领导
    在企业的全体职工中，尤其在各级领导干部中，树立党必须领导一切、而且能够领导一切的思想，是一件头等重要的事情。几年来，我们对职工系统地进行了关于党的领导的政治思想教育，不断地克服各种不尊重党的领导的倾向，使党的绝对领导的思想在全体干部和职工中巩固地树立起来。这就为贯彻党的指示、决议、方针和政策打下了根本的政治思想基础。
    集体领导是党的领导的根本原则。因此，企业里的重大问题必须由党委集体讨论决定。党要领导一切，但又不能不分事情的大小和轻重缓急一把抓。按照我们的经验，像贯彻党的方针政策，企业的生产计划，技术规划，重大技术措施，基本建设，远景规划，劳动组织的重要改革，重要规章制度的变化，中心工作，各项运动，一个时期各项工作的全面安排，重大的经费开支，重大的人身、机器、经济事故的检查与处理，主要干部的任免，等等，都是重大问题，都应该由党委讨论决定。但是大问题和小问题不是一成不变的，它在一定条件下相互转化；也常有预料不到的重大问题会产生；也有时对大、小问题辨别不清。因此，党委认为需要讨论什么的时候，就讨论什么，绝不受任何限制。每个委员和部门的领导干部，不能认为党委只能抓重大问题，就不能过问小事情。
    要保证党委集体领导，必须有健全的会议制度，不要用个别交换意见、传阅书面材料或签字的办法来代替党委集体讨论。当然，对重大问题，个别交换意见、传阅书面材料是完全需要的，但这只能是为党委会议做准备工作。搞好集体领导的另一个重要问题是不断地提高会议的质量，要做到会议开的时间短、讨论的成熟，决定的正确。而要做到这样，就必须在会前充分准备。全面性的问题首先由书记考虑；部门性的重大问题，由主管部门先考虑。会前充分考虑和交换意见，必要时事前印成文字东西，发给各个委员。每次会议讨论不可过多，有一、二个主要问题就可以了。会上充分发扬民主，一定要做到畅所欲言，允许保留不同意见，防止乱扣帽子。意见不一致、不成熟的问题缓作结论，会后再考虑，再研究，下次会议再讨论；反复研究考虑，总会一致起来。
    保证党的集体领导的根本关键是党委的团结，特别是书记和厂长的团结。我们过去在团结上曾一度发生过问题。两年以来，经过伟大的整风运动和几次总结党的领导经验，现在完全在党的原则下团结起来了。我们的基本经验是：重大问题不做个人决定，委员分工负责的工作是党分配的任务，各人对党委负责，不能把自己所分工的范围看成是独立王国。每个委员必须认真向党委反映情况，坚决执行党委的各项决定，并报告自己执行的情况。在党委会议、党小组的会议上对错误思想开展批评和自我批评时，既认真严肃，又和风细雨。委员之间经常交换意见，互相谈心，互相帮助；不背后乱扯，犯自由主义。因此，大家思想一致，行动一致，心情舒畅，精神愉快，工作有饱满的热情。
    党的集体领导必须与大搞群众运动相结合
    党的集体领导的智慧来自广大群众，党的集体领导的决定，是广大群众智慧的结晶。没有广大群众的意见和智慧，脱离了客观实践，党的集体领导就是空的，因而，党的集体领导必须建立在群众路线的基础上。
    群众路线是党的根本路线，是实现全面大跃进的根本方法。而贯彻群众路线必须大搞群众运动，不是小搞群众运动。只有大搞群众运动，群众的积极性、创造性才能高度发挥，才能促使生产飞跃发展。大搞群众运动又必须有党的集体领导，没有党的坚强领导，群众运动是盲目的、无组织的、涣散无力的，因而也达不到理想的结果。只有加强党的领导，掌握运动的方向、重点和形式，群众运动才能正确地、健康地、有目的地发展。
    党的集体领导既然建立在群众路线的基础上，因而党委如何联系群众，如何密切党与群众的关系，就是一个十分重要的问题。党联系群众的方法很多，我们采用的主要有这样几种：
  （一）领导干部与群众同吃、同住、同劳动。
  （二）经常召开各种座谈会。在会上既听取先进的、正确的反映，也耐心地听取落后的错误的意见。（三）各部门、各单位领导人员的汇报会。这种会在每一项中心任务下达和每一运动开展以后，都及时地召开。在会上听取各部门各单位的领导人员的意见，反映和研究群众的活动情况，确定下一步的做法。（四）党委深入重点研究试验，取得经验，推动一般。
  （五）定期召开职工代表大会。（六）组织参观、评比，开现场会。（七）组织力量，检查工作。有时发动群众全面检查，有时局部地、重点地检查，通过检查了解党的方针、政策和党委的决定、指示执行的情况；了解群众在生产上、思想上、工作上、生活上的反映，发现问题及时解决。
    党对群众运动的具体领导
    工厂是生产单位，它的根本任务是发展生产。因此，工厂所进行的群众运动，最主要的是直接为生产服务的运动。即经常大搞的是生产运动。当然也有其他性质的运动，但也必须以生产为前提，围绕生产去进行。抛开生产孤立地大搞群众运动是不对的。
    生产要高速度地发展，必须依据不断革命的思想，不断地大搞群众运动。因此，党委集体领导的重要任务之一，就是开展这一次运动的时候，就要考虑下一次运动的内容与要求；总结这一次运动的经验，组织发动下一次的运动。我们去年就搞了多次大规模的群众运动。去年年初，我们针对生产中的某些混乱现象和存在的若干问题，发动群众大鸣大放，提出了两万多条意见。党委分析研究了这些意见，认为主要问题，是计划管理心中无数，技术管理无人负责，财务工作混乱，技术水平低。因此根据生产的需要与群众的要求，做出决定，有计划、有步骤地回到群众中去。1月至3月，重点整顿了计划管理，建立与健全了一套计划管理制度；3月至5月，重点整顿了技术管理制度；5月至6月，重点整顿了财务成本制度；7月至11月，重点开展了拖拉机的技术补课运动。同时每个月都组织了高产运动。事实证明，这些运动是我们去年提前全面完成计划的重大保证。
    贯彻党委领导下的厂长负责制发挥工会、共青团的作用
    行政、工会、共青团是党委领导下的重要部门，是党委的有力助手，是大搞群众运动的主要力量，必须充分发挥它们的作用。
    党委对行政的领导是绝对的。有时党委认为对行政的某些工作要直接抓起来，也是必需的。党委对行政工作管的多少，这是厂长不应计较的问题。但是在没有特殊必要的情况下，行政的各项工作，应由厂长去负责处理。党委要注意发挥行政的积极作用，鼓励厂长对行政工作大胆负责。党委处理行政工作的时候，要吸收有关厂长参加。一种办法是党委直接处理，一种办法是通过厂长去处理；后一种应是主要的方法。
    工会、共青团对大搞群众运动，组织竞赛，总结推广先进经验，组织职工学习，进行政治思想教育，关心职工生活等负担着特别重要的任务。因此，党委要加强对工会、共青团的日常领导，充分发挥这些组织的积极性。
    争取今年的继续大跃进
    1960年，我厂负担着两项光荣而艰巨的任务。第一，在1959年全面大跃进的基础上，把拖拉机的产量提高三倍以上，并不断地提高质量，降低成本，提高劳动生产率。第二，要完成规模巨大的扩建任务，为大批生产拖拉机创造条件。在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，我们要继续坚决地高举总路线的红旗，坚持政治挂帅，加强党的集体领导，大搞以技术革新和技术革命为中心的群众运动，保证完满地完成这两个任务，实现今年的继续跃进。
