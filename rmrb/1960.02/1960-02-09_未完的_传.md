    The Unfinished "Biography"
    Xue Yangyu
    I recently watched "An Old Soldier's New Story" again and felt that the ending of the film was handled very well. Although the ending of the film "An Old Soldier's New Story" omitted the wedding and dance party scenes designed by the playwright, it caused some people to feel regret. According to general handling, the new people have grown up, the farm has been established, the fields are golden, and harvesters are running everywhere. The film should end here; but in the film, we see the old soldier embarking on a new journey with ambition again—to take on more arduous reclamation tasks in the distance.
    This turn of the camera is not superfluous, not an artistic showmanship, but the result of the artist's deep thinking, and a true reflection of the reality of socialist society. This last heavy stroke makes the ideological content of the whole film richer, and the spiritual realm of the old soldier higher. The film is over, but people see that the biography of this "Old Soldier's New Story" is not finished yet, and it needs to be written in a big way. Aren't there thousands of such communist fighters in our lives, fighting north and south, not seeking comfort, and going wherever there are difficulties! On our industrial and agricultural fronts, there have been two consecutive years of great leaps forward, and now we have won a good start! The ending of "An Old Soldier's New Story" precisely summarizes our real life. It encourages people to have great ambitions and constantly leap forward for the cause of communism to build our happy life!

    未完的“传”
    薛养玉
    最近又看了一遍“老兵新传”，觉得影片的结尾处理得很不错。尽管影片“老兵新传”的结尾删去了剧作者给设计的婚礼和舞会的场面，引起了一些人的惋惜。按一般处理，新人成长起来了，农场建立起来了，田地一片金黄，到处奔驰着收割机，影片到此就该结束了；但在影片里，我们却看到老战士又雄心勃勃地踏上新的征途——到远方担负更艰苦的垦荒任务。
    镜头这一转，不是画蛇添足，不是艺术上的卖弄花枪，而是艺术家深刻思索的结果，是社会主义社会现实生活的真实反映。这最后一笔浓浓地一点，使全片的思想内容更为饱满，老战士的精神境界更高了。影片演完了，但是人们看到，这个“老兵新传”的传记还没有终篇，还要大写特写下去。我们的生活中不正是有成千上万这样的共产主义战士，他们转战南北，不图安逸，哪里有困难就开赴哪里吗！在我们的工农业战线上，连续二年是大跃进，现在又赢得开门红！“老兵新传”的结尾正是概括了我们的现实生活，它鼓舞着人们为了共产主义事业，立大志，不断跃进，来建设我们幸福的生活！
