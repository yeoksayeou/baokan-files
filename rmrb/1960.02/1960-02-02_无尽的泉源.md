    An upsurge of mass competition centered on technical innovation and technical revolution is surging forward with the first new spring of the sixties.
    After the Anshan Iron and Steel Company workers, who pioneered the technology performance competition, spread their advanced innovation experiences to various places, they added the words "joint" to the original competition name, turning it into a joint grand competition. Thus, the scope of the competition is wider than before, and the masses drawn into the competition torrent are also more extensive than before.
    The workers of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, who were the first to raise the "one-dragon" competition, adhered to the principle of taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward. Their production is becoming more and more rhythmic, and more and more regions and departments are adopting the "one-dragon" competition. There are "one-dragons" everywhere, and a situation of dragons dancing everywhere has emerged.
    This is an era of breaking superstitions and emancipating the mind, an era of soaring enthusiasm and grand competitions. The rich and varied forms of competition and the inspiring competition goals have changed the face of enterprises and also the mental outlook of people. Look, the great collaboration of "not letting a brother factory fall behind" carried out by all walks of life in Shanghai, how high the communist style is! The workers throughout Hubei Province must work like Ma Xueli, one person running, ten thousand people chasing, how spectacular it is! The "three-way combination" grand collaboration competition in Shenyang twists the wisdom and strength of the three aspects on nine lines into one rope, heading towards one goal. How clear is this comradeship-style mutual assistance and cooperation!
    Through various socialist labor competitions, the business management of enterprises has also been further improved, and the rapidly developing productive forces after technological innovation are further adapted to their relations of production. The centralized leadership of enterprises is combined with the vigorous mass movement, the professional management of enterprises is combined with workers' participation in management, and the rules and regulations of enterprises are combined with the masses' consciousness. It can be seen that the socialist labor competition under the shining light of the general line is a competition for the rapid development of productive forces and a competition for the continuous improvement of production relations. Politics is the commander, the lifeline of all economic work. Many economic workers and factory and mine managers have learned in the competition how to combine political work with economic work, so the enterprises and production units they are in charge of are full of vitality, high spirits, and soaring enthusiasm.
    We understand that productive forces are the most active, most positive, and most revolutionary factors in production. The development and changes of productive forces determine the changes in production relations, but production relations in turn promote the development of productive forces. Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his report at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party: "The development of social productive forces requires socialist revolution, requires the liberation of people's minds, the victory of the socialist revolution and the liberation of people's minds; and promotes the leap forward of social productive forces; this improvement of productive forces continues to stimulate the improvement of socialist production relations and the progress of people's thinking." The facts are exactly like this. Our Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and a whole set of policies of "walking on two legs," has not only opened up broad avenues for the high-speed development of new productive forces, but also promoted the further improvement of production relations. The vigorous mass movements of technical innovation and technical revolution and various socialist labor competitions carried out in various places have not only promoted the leap forward development of productive forces, but also promoted the adaptation of production relations accordingly. The changes in the management of many enterprises, the great development of communist style in all walks of life, and the further improvement of relations between people have all powerfully proved that the Party's general line is completely correct.
    At present, the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution is promoting the continuous development of productive forces, and production relations need to be continuously improved to adapt to the rapid development of productive forces. In the continuous two years of the Great Leap Forward, many good methods have been created in various places. For example, the implementation of communist grand collaboration (including collaboration inside and outside the factory, in various industries), the implementation of cadres participating in production labor and workers participating in production management, the implementation of the three-way combination of cadres, workers, and technicians, and the reform of unreasonable rules and regulations, etc. All these methods belong to improving production relations to adapt them to the development of productive forces. The enterprise management three-way combination grand collaboration competition movement carried out in Shenyang City has skillfully grasped the main contradictions in enterprise management. In the competition of adhering to putting politics in command and carrying out vigorous mass movements, it has twisted all aspects up, down, left, and right in one direction, promoting the Great Leap Forward in production. This approach is adapted to the needs of the high-speed development of productive forces. Because this mutual assistance and cooperation relationship is always one of the huge fountains for the rapid development of productive forces.

    一个以技术革新和技术革命为中心的群众性的竞赛浪潮，伴随着六十年代的第一个新春浩浩荡荡地奔腾而来。
    首创技术表演赛的鞍钢职工们把先进的革新经验传播各地以后，又在原有竞赛的名字上添加了“联合”两个字，变成联合大竞赛，从而竞赛的范围比过去更广了，卷到竞赛洪流的群众也比过去更加广泛了。
    高举“一条龙”竞赛最早的重庆钢铁公司的职工们坚持了以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针，他们的生产愈来愈有节奏了，采取“一条龙”竞赛的地区和部门也愈来愈多了。到处都有“一条龙”，出现了一个群龙飞舞的形势。
    这是破除迷信、解放思想的年代，这是干劲冲天、大比大赛的年代。丰富多采的竞赛形式，令人向往的竞赛目标，改变了企业的面貌，也改变了人的精神面貌。看，上海各行各业开展的“不让一个兄弟厂掉队”的大协作，共产主义风格是多么地高！湖北全省的职工都要照马学礼那样干活，一人跑、万人追，又是多么壮观！沈阳的“三结合”大协作竞赛，把九条线上三个方面的智慧和力量，拧成了一根绳，奔赴一个目标，这种同志式的互助合作关系又是多么的鲜明！
    通过各种各样的社会主义劳动竞赛，企业的经营管理也进一步改善了，技术革新以后迅速发展的生产力和它的生产关系进一步相适应了。企业的集中领导和大搞群众运动结合起来了，企业的专业管理和工人参加管理结合起来了，企业的规章制度和群众的自觉性结合起来了。可见，在总路线光辉照耀下的社会主义劳动竞赛，是生产力飞速发展的竞赛，又是生产关系不断完善的竞赛。政治是统帅，是一切经济工作的生命线。许许多多经济工作人员和厂矿主管人员在竞赛中学会了用政治工作同经济工作相结合的方法，因而他们主管的企业和生产单位，就生气勃勃，意志昂扬，干劲冲天。
    我们懂得：生产力是生产中最活跃最积极最革命的因素。生产力的发展、变化，决定着生产关系的变化，但是，生产关系又反过来促进生产力的发展。刘少奇同志在党的八大二次会议的报告中指出：“社会生产力的发展要求社会主义革命，要求人们精神的解放，社会主义革命的胜利和人们精神的解放；又推动社会生产力的跃进；这种生产力的改进，又继续刺激社会主义生产关系的改进和人们思想的前进。”事实正是这样，我们党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，既为新的生产力高速度发展开辟了广阔道路，又促进了生产关系的进一步改善。各地开展的轰轰烈烈的群众性的技术革新、技术革命运动和各种各样的社会主义劳动竞赛，不仅促进了生产力的飞跃发展，而且，也推动了生产关系相适应地改善。许多企业管理面貌的改变，共产主义风格在各行各业中的大发扬，人与人之间的关系的进一步改善，都有力地证明了党的总路线是完全正确的。
    目前，群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动正在促进生产力不停地向前发展着，生产关系也就需要不断地加以改进，使其和生产力的迅速发展相适应。在连续两年的大跃进中各地已经创造了许多好的办法。比如实行共产主义大协作（包括厂内厂外、各行业的协作），实行干部参加生产劳动和工人参加生产管理，实行干部、工人、技术人员三结合，改革不合理的规章制度，等等。所有这些办法，都是属于改善生产关系、使之适应于生产力的发展的。沈阳市开展的企业管理三结合大协作竞赛运动，巧妙地抓住了企业管理的主要矛盾，在坚持政治挂帅、大搞群众运动的竞赛中，把上下左右各方面都拧到一个方向去，促进了生产的大跃进。这种做法，是适应生产力高速度发展所需要的。因为这种互助合作关系永远是生产力迅速发展的巨大泉源之一。
