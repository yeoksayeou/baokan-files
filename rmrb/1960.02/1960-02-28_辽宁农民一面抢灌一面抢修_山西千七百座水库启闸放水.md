Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang Telegram: Liaoning Province's commune members are actively carrying out spring irrigation and drought prevention to ensure timely sowing.

Since last winter, there has been little snowfall in Liaoning, and some areas are already experiencing spring drought. In order to combat spring drought and strengthen soil moisture conservation, people's communes in various regions have vigorously carried out winter irrigation while repairing water conservancy projects during the winter. By the end of January, the province's winter irrigation area reached more than 940,000 mu. Generally, furrow irrigation and ditch irrigation were implemented, and water was evenly distributed, changing the phenomenon of flooding irrigation. The quality of winter irrigation has improved significantly compared with previous years. After the Spring Festival, a larger-scale, faster-paced, and higher-quality spring irrigation upsurge has been launched in various regions. Many people's communes have organized spring irrigation professional teams to carry out spring irrigation assault weeks and assault ten-day periods. The Xiguanyingzi People's Commune in Beipiao County, under the slogan of "irrigating flat land with water, and moving ice to the mountains," moved ice to irrigate 300 mu of fields.

In order to speed up the progress of spring irrigation, various regions are currently rushing to irrigate and repair water conservancy projects at the same time, striving to complete projects that will benefit the current year as soon as possible. Various regions are also focusing on engineering support and river interception and water storage to ensure that there is water in the reservoirs, that the reservoirs are connected to the canals, and that the wells are fully equipped, so that water conservancy projects can quickly exert irrigation benefits. After a short period of concentrated effort, Suizhong County has built more than 190,000 meters of canals, and 244 projects have achieved reservoirs connected to canals and wells connected to equipment. In Andong County, more than 9,000 water conservancy projects have been equipped, achieving reservoirs connected to canals and water reaching level ground, and more than 31,000 mu of spring fields have been irrigated.

During the spring irrigation, various regions have vigorously engaged in technical innovation, improved labor organization, and tried every means to improve the progress and quality of irrigation.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, February 27th: Water conservancy projects built in Shanxi Province last winter and this spring, as well as in the past few years, have played a huge role in the current drought prevention and resistance. As of the 22nd, 1,700 large, medium, and small reservoirs across the province have opened their gates to release water, starting spring irrigation.

In the Jinzhong area, 371 reservoirs have started releasing water. As of the 22nd, 580,000 mu of land in the area had been irrigated with reservoir water. The Fenhe Reservoir, which has stored 59 million cubic meters of water, released water for the first time on the 19th, irrigating more than 43,000 mu of land per day. Now, the rolling Fenhe River water flows through the reservoir gates into the two major trunk canals, which are 100 kilometers long, and heads towards the vast Jinzhong Plain. Tens of thousands of people in Qingxu, Taigu, Wenshui, Fenyang, Pingyao, and other counties along the river cheered, welcoming the first time they used clean water from the Fenhe Reservoir to irrigate their fields.

In the Jin Southeast area, during the water conservancy construction campaign last winter, each county first repaired and supported the original reservoir projects, adding more than 4,000 various canals and leveling the land in the reservoir irrigation area. While focusing on rushing to repair the main structure of the newly built reservoirs, attention was also paid to supporting facilities. Therefore, more than 550 reservoirs are currently releasing water for irrigation. Reservoirs in the Jin South and Jin North areas have also opened their gates to release water. The more than 100 reservoirs that have already released water in the Jin South area have a total storage capacity of more than 44 million cubic meters, which is an important material condition for preventing and overcoming spring drought. In the Jin North area, due to the organization of professional teams to specialize in repairing canals and leveling the land, by February 10th, the irrigated area had been improved by 2.02 million mu.

    辽宁农民一面抢灌一面抢修
    山西千七百座水库启闸放水
    据新华社沈阳电　辽宁省各地社员积极春灌防旱，保证适时播种。
    辽宁各地去冬以来冬雪较少，目前一部分地区已发生春旱。为了战胜春旱和加强保墒工作，各地人民公社在冬修水利工程同时，就大力开展了冬灌工作。到1月底为止，全省冬灌面积达到九十四万多亩，一般都做到了畦灌、沟灌、灌水均匀，改变了大水漫灌的现象，冬灌质量比往年有显著提高。春节以后，各地又掀起了规模更大、进度更快、质量更好的春灌高潮。许多人民公社组织了春灌专业队，开展春灌突击周、突击旬。北票县西官营子人民公社，在“平地灌水，山地搬冰”的口号下，全社搬冰灌田三百亩。
    为了加快春灌进度，目前各地正一面抢灌，一面抢修水利工程，力争当年受益工程提早竣工。各地还大抓工程配套和拦河蓄水，做到有库就有水，库成渠通，井成具全，让水利工程迅速发挥灌溉效益。绥中县经过短期突击，修成十九万多米渠道，已经有二百四十四处工程实现了有库有渠和有井有械。安东县九千多处水利工程都已配套，做到了库成渠通，水到地平，现已灌溉春田三万一千多亩。
    在春灌中，各地大搞技术革新，改善劳动组织，千方百计提高灌溉进度和质量。
    据新华社太原27日电　山西各地去冬今春和过去几年兴修的水利工程，在当前防旱、抗旱中发挥了巨大作用。到22日为止，全省已有一千七百座大中小型水库启闸放水，开始春浇。
    在晋中地区，已有三百七十一座水库开始放水，到22日为止，全区已用库水浇地五十八万亩。已经蓄水达五千九百万立方米的汾河水库在19日第一次放水浇地，每天可浇地四万三千多亩。现在滚滚的汾河水，通过水库闸门流入长达一百公里的东西两大干渠，奔向辽阔的晋中平原。沿河两岸的清徐、太谷、文水、汾阳、平遥等县万民欢腾，迎接第一次用汾河水库清水浇田。
    晋东南地区在去冬水利建设运动中，各县首先对原有水库工程进行了整修和配套，增开各种渠道四千多条，平整了水库灌溉区的土地。对新建的水库在突击抢修主体工程的同时，也注意了配套。因此当前已有五百五十多座水库放水浇地。晋南、晋北地区的水库也启闸放水。晋南地区已经放水的一百多座水库，共蓄水四千四百多万立方米，是防御和战胜春旱的重要物质条件之一。晋北地区各公社由于组织专业队，专门修渠、平地，到2月10日止，已改善灌溉面积二百零二万亩。（附图片）
