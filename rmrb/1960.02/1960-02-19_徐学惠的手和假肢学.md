　　Xu Xuehui's Hand and Prosthetics

    Prosthetics is a relatively complex technical science. In recent years, people in various countries have been engaged in research and have made considerable progress. In the Soviet Union, due to the concern for the working people, prosthetic technology is one of the important research tasks of the trauma plastic surgery medical department, and there are specialized scientific journals reporting prosthetic technology. In our country, in the past, there were only a few small private prosthetic factories in a few large cities, and the technology was very backward. After liberation, with the development of my country's industry and medical and health undertakings, as well as the help of the Soviet Union, the prosthetic industry has made significant leaps forward in organization and technology. The successful installation of Xu Xuehui's "Sino-Soviet Friendship Hand" not only embodies the sincere and great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, but will also greatly encourage my country's prosthetic technology and industry.

    Prosthetic installation, for the wounded: in terms of shape, can make up for the appearance of limb defects; in terms of function, can partially or largely restore the motor function of the wounded's limbs. In this way, they can restore their ability to work and return to their jobs; in life, they can also reduce the care others need to give them.

    There are many types of prosthetics. Defects in various parts of the human body, especially external defects, can generally be repaired by installing prosthetics. Common ones include: prosthetic hands, prosthetic arms, prosthetic feet, and prosthetic legs. Artificial eyes, artificial ears, artificial noses, and the most common dentures all fall into this category of treatment.

    According to the characteristics of the shape and function of various parts of the human body, the requirements for prosthetics in various parts are also different. The hand is a very important and complex organ of the human body, so the manufacture of prosthetic hands is more difficult. There are two types of general prosthetic hands: one is only for morphological restoration, so that the hand is complete in appearance; the other is for functional restoration, which can be achieved by installing attachments or tools on the prosthetic hand; The power of the elbow or shoulder joint can also be used to enable the fingers of the prosthetic hand to have the ability to extend, flex, hold, and grasp through cables and with the help of mechanical actions such as springs or levers. With the progress of modern precision machinery, motion plastic surgery, plastic materials and other sciences, there are also more complex so-called "motion plastic hands" and "electric hands" being trial-manufactured.

    The Soviet Union has accumulated rich advanced experience in prosthetic science and technology. Therefore, it can design lightweight, flexible, and easy-to-master prosthetic hands according to different residual limbs and the patient's existing functions. At present, the Soviet Union has many types of prosthetic hands. Xu Xuehui's "Sino-Soviet Friendship Hand" has three types.

    One is a working hand. It is a sleeve made of partial metal strips and soft leather. There is a leather fixing strap device on the elbow joint, which makes the elbow not easy to be worn out during work, so it does not affect blood circulation, nor does it hinder labor. The outside of the sleeve is equipped with metal spring clips, a special universal receiver, and universal pliers. Put the sleeve on the residual end, and then insert various special tools (such as fitter tools and carpenter tools) into the receiver, and use the strength of the elbow joint and the residual end to replace the real hand to engage in many kinds of labor, such as sawing wood, nailing nails, chopping firewood, etc. (Figure 1)

    The second is a cosmetic hand. It is a glove made of the best chemical raw material - polyvinyl chloride plastic. The glove is filled with soft rubber, and the appearance is beautiful and the color is close to flesh color. The hand has skin wrinkles, and several blue blood vessels are exposed on the back of the hand. The five fingers are in a semi-flexed state. The sleeve of the cosmetic hand is made of soft leather. One end of the sleeve is connected to the prosthetic hand, and the other end is to put the residual end into the sleeve, so the hand and wrist are very soft and realistic, very similar to a real hand, and can freely shake hands with others, and can also drink tea. (Figure 2).

    The most outstanding feature in the design is Xu Xuehui's third type of living sleeve. Our country does not yet have this product. It is a small sleeve made of sturdy elastic cloth, equipped with screw clips, which can clamp special daily life tools, and the sleeve is directly put on the residual end. In this way, it can be used freely and give full play to the function of the residual end. It can perform many kinds of movements, such as cutting cloth, writing, typing, shaving, combing hair, eating, etc. (Figure 3) 〔Originally published in "Beijing Evening News"〕

    徐学惠的手和假肢学
    中国医学科学院  整形外科医院副教授  桂世礽
  　北京市假肢工厂　程鸿儒
    假肢学是一门较复杂的技术科学，近年来，世界各国都有人从事研究，有了不少的进步。在苏联，由于对劳动人民的关怀，假肢技术是创伤整形医疗部门的重要研究工作之一，并且有专门报道假肢技术的科学杂志。在我国，过去只在几个大城市有几家小的私营假肢厂，技术很落后。解放以后，随着我国工业和医疗卫生事业的发展，以及苏联的帮助，假肢工业在组织上和技术上都有了显著的跃进。徐学惠“中苏友谊之手”的安装成功，除了体现中苏两国人民真挚的伟大友谊之外，对于我国的假肢技术与工业，也必将起极大的鼓舞作用。
    假肢安装，对于伤员来说：在形态上，可以弥补肢体缺陷的外形；在功能上，可以使伤员肢体的运动功能得到部分或大部分恢复。这样，就可以恢复劳动能力，重返工作岗位；在生活上也可以减少别人对自己的照顾。
    假肢的种类很多。人体各部的缺损，尤其是体外的缺陷，一般都可以用安装假肢的办法来修复，常见的有：假手、假臂、假脚和假腿等。假眼、假耳、假鼻和最普通的假牙，也都属于这种治疗范畴。
    根据人体各部形态与功能的特点，对于各部假肢的要求也不相同。手是人体很重要和很复杂的一个器官，因此，假手的制造就比较困难。一般的假手有两种：一种只是为了形态上的恢复，使手部在外观上完整；另一种是为了功能上的恢复，可以通过假手上安装附件或工具，达到这个目的；也可以利用肘关节或肩关节的动力，通过缆索，借助弹簧或杠杆等机械作用，使假手的手指有伸、屈、执、握的能力。随着近代精密机械、运动整形术、塑型材料等科学的进展，还有更复杂的所谓“运动整形手”“电手”等的试制。
    苏联在假肢科学技术方面积累了丰富的先进经验。所以，能根据不同残肢和患者现存的功能，设计出轻便灵活、易于掌握的假手。目前，苏联有许多类型的假手。徐学惠的“中苏友谊之手”共有三种。
    一种是工作手。它是用部分金属条和柔软的皮革制成的套筒。在肘关节上有一用皮革制的固定带装置，它使肘部在工作时不易被磨破，所以不影响血液循环，也不妨碍劳动。套筒外侧装有金属弹簧卡子、特制的万能接受器和万能钳。将套筒套在残端上，然后将特制的各种工具（如钳工工具、木工工具）插在接受器内，运用肘关节和残端的力量，就可以代替真正的手从事许多种劳动，如锯木头、钉钉子、劈劈柴等。（如图一）
    第二种是美容手。它是用最好的化学原料——聚氯乙烯塑料制成的手套。手套内装上软性的橡胶，外表美观、颜色近似肉色。手上有皮肤皱纹，手背上显露出几条青色的血管，五个手指呈半屈曲状态。美容手的套筒用柔软的皮革制成，套筒的一端连接假手，另一端是把残端穿在套筒内，因此手同腕部很柔软，富有真实感，很像真手，可以自由地同别人握手，还可以喝茶。（如图二）。
    在设计上有突出特点的，是徐学惠的第三种生活套袖。目前我国还没有这种产品。它是用坚固的松紧布做成小套，上面装有螺丝夹，能卡住特制的日常生活工具，将套筒直接套在残端上。这样，就能运用自如，充分发挥残端的功能，可以作许多种动作，如剪布、写字、打字、刮脸、梳头、吃饭等。（如图三）　〔原载“北京晚报”〕
