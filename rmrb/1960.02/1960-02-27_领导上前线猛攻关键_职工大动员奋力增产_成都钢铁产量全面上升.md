Leaders Go to the Front Lines to Attack Key Points, Workers Are Fully Mobilized to Strive for Increased Production
Chengdu Steel Production Rises Comprehensively

(According to Sichuan Daily news) The workers of various factories and mines in the Chengdu steel smelting system, based on the instructions of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on the 15th, have actively taken measures to vigorously increase production and quality. From the 16th to the 20th, the output of major products such as steel, iron, and steel materials all increased compared with the previous five days. Among them, steel production increased by 18.34%, pig iron increased by 3.46%, and steel materials increased by 25.57%. The quality of steel and pig iron also improved compared with the previous five days.

The broad masses of workers and staff of various factories and mines enthusiastically responded to the Party's call and acted positively, quickly launching a new high tide of production. Leading cadres of various factories and mines went deep into the front line of production, fully mobilized the workers, and fully besieged various key production points. The Chengdu Steel Plant, led by the Party Committee Secretary and Deputy Director, led the heads of various departments to go deep into the workshops and form a steelmaking front-line command. They adopted the method of going all the way to the end to mobilize the masses and launched a mass movement to increase production, focusing on improving furnace age. Workers and staff, in response to the problems existing in knotting, rendering oil, and bricklaying, took many measures to improve the quality of the tar furnace lining, so that the furnace age gradually increased. Leading cadres of the steelmaking workshop and the sand casting workshop of the Chengdu Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, with the same vigor as in the fourth quarter of last year when they vigorously grasped steel production, ate, lived, and labored with the workers, and launched a blitz attack on the key of high sulfur content in pig iron, attacking sulfur layer by layer at six checkpoints, and using pig iron with a sulfur content of more than 1.1% to make qualified steel. Coking plants and iron mines also held mobilization rallies for the leap forward, mobilizing the masses to break through key points and attack weak links, forming a comprehensive upsurge in ensuring steel production.

In order to continuously improve the level of production, leading cadres of various factories and mines, while vigorously grasping the current key to production, also vigorously grasped technological innovation and technological revolution, actively promoted advanced experience, and vigorously improved the quantity and quality of products. The steel branch of Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant achieved more than 20 major technological innovations in a short period of time, greatly improving work efficiency, saving labor, and creating favorable conditions for further improving production. The coking workers of various coking plants widely promoted the coal washing experience of "preliminary washing with lime water, washing with clean water" and the smelting method of "large fire door, high flue, wide flue, and fierce fire combustion" to increase the output and quality of coke.

    领导上前线猛攻关键　职工大动员奋力增产
    成都钢铁产量全面上升
    据四川日报消息　成都钢铁冶炼系统各厂矿职工根据中共四川省委15日的指示，积极采取措施，大力提高产量、质量。从16日到20日，钢、铁、钢材等主要产品的产量，同前五日比较，都有提高。其中，钢产量上升18．34％，生铁上升3．46％，钢材增长25．57％。钢和生铁的质量较前五天也有提高。
    各厂矿广大职工群众热烈响应党的号召，积极行动起来，很快就掀起了生产新高潮。各厂矿领导干部纷纷深入生产第一线，充分发动职工，全力围攻各项生产关键。成都钢铁厂由党委书记和副厂长率领各科室负责人员深入车间，组成炼钢前线指挥部，采取一竿子插到底的办法，发动群众，以提高炉龄为中心，开展了一个群众性的增产运动。职工群众针对打结、熬油、砌炉中存在的问题，采取很多措施，提高焦油炉衬的质量，使炉龄逐步上升。成都机车车辆工厂炼钢车间和翻砂车间的领导干部，拿出去年第四季度大抓钢铁生产的劲头，和工人同吃、同住、同劳动，突击生铁含硫量高的关键，在六道关口上层层攻硫，用含硫量在1．1％以上的生铁炼出了合格钢。焦厂、铁矿等也纷纷举行跃进誓师大会，动员群众大破关键，突击薄弱环节，形成全面保钢的热潮。
    为了不断提高生产水平，各厂矿领导干部在大抓当前生产关键的同时，还狠抓技术革新和技术革命，积极推广先进经验，大力提高产品的数量和质量。成都量具刃具厂钢铁分厂，短期内实现了重大技术革新二十多项，工效大大提高，节约了劳动力，为进一步提高生产创造了有利的条件。各焦厂的炼焦职工们广泛推行“用石灰水初洗、清水清洗”的洗煤经验和“大火门、高火道、宽火道、猛火燃烧”的冶炼方法，提高焦炭的产量和质量。
