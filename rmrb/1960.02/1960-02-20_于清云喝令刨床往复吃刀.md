Xinhua News Agency, Changchun Telegram Changchun City Machinery Factory's fifth-grade fitter, Yu Qingyun, after eight months of research, successfully tested a new technology of single-blade reciprocating cutting on a planer, opening up new avenues for improving the production efficiency of planers.

Yu Qingyun's new creation was carried out on a 500mm bullhead planer. He installed an automatic device on this planer - a single-blade reciprocating automatic rotator. As the tool reciprocated, the tool head could automatically adjust its direction, thus realizing cutting in both directions. This creation doubled the production efficiency of the planer and fully maintained the original flexibility of the planer.

Yu Qingyun did not attend school in his childhood, nor was he a planer operator; he only had ten years of fitter experience. During the continuous Great Leap Forward, he saw that due to the low efficiency of the planer, the tool head only cut in one direction and idled on the return, resulting in a backlog of cast and forged blanks in the workshop that could not be planed, affecting the assembly progress of the fitters. He wanted to improve the planer. When the Party called on workers to engage in technical innovation and bold creation, he put forward this suggestion. At that time, he received the Party's encouragement and support. When Yu Qingyun started this innovation, he didn't have a clear idea in his mind. Every day after the planer operators got off work, he would stand next to the planer and watch. He thought that since people can turn around and come back when walking, if the planer's tool head could rotate back and forth, it could definitely reciprocate and cut. But how could it rotate back and forth? He thought for five months before he came up with a way to install an automatic device. In October of last year, he began to make parts according to his ideas. During the trial process, the factory Party committee and the workshop Party branch always cared for him and supported him, organizing workers of ten types of work, such as lathe operators, planer operators, and fitters, to help him process various parts again and again. More than eighty employees supported Yu Qingyun's creation. The factory Party committee also sent the head of the technical inspection section, veteran worker Wang Yigang, to work with him. Li Shude, the secretary of the workshop Party branch, also helped him day and night to come up with ideas. After 210 repeated experiments, Yu Qingyun's automatic reciprocating rotator for planers was finally successful, enabling the planer, which had never been able to cut back and forth, to achieve reciprocating cutting.

    于清云喝令刨床往复吃刀
    新华社长春电　长春市机械厂五级钳工于清云经过八个月研究，试验成功了刨床单刀往复吃刀新技术，为提高刨床生产效率开辟了新途径。
    于清云的新创造是在一台五百毫米的牛头刨床上进行的。他在这台刨床上安装了一个自动装置——单刀往复自动回转器，随着刀具往复，刀头可以自动调转方向，因此实现了来回切削。这项创造使刨床的生产效率提高了一倍，并且完全保持了刨床原有的灵活性。
    于清云幼年没有读过书，也不是刨工，只有十年钳工经验。在连续大跃进中，他看到由于刨床效率低，操作起来刀头只是一去吃刀，回来空刨，车间里积压着铸锻毛坯件刨不出来，影响钳工的装配进度，就想改进一下刨床。当党号召工人大搞技术革新，大胆创造时，他就提出了这项建议。当时得到了党的鼓励和支持。于清云着手搞这项革新时，脑子里还没有谱。每天刨工下班，他就站在刨床旁边看，他想，既然人走路向后一转就能回来，刨床的刀头要能前后转动，也一定可以往复吃刀。但是怎样才能前后转动呢？他整整想了五个月才想出了一个安装自动装置的办法。去年10月，他开始按照自己的想法制做零件。在试验过程中，工厂党委和车间党支部一直关心他，支持他，组织车工、刨工、钳工等十个工种的工人帮助他一次又一次地加工各种部件，先后有八十多名职工支援于清云的创造。厂党委还派技术检查科长、老工人王宜刚和他共同研究。车间党支部书记李树德也日夜帮助他出主意想办法。经过二百一十次反复试验，于清云创造的刨床自动往复回转器终于成功，使一向不能来回吃刀的刨床实现了来回切削。
