According to Fujian Daily news: The early-sown wheat in Fuqing County, southern Fujian Province, has begun to be harvested. According to statistics from 1,239 mu of wheat that has already been harvested, the average per-mu yield is 214 jin, which is 67 jin more than the per-mu yield of 147 jin in 1958, a year of good wheat harvest, representing an increase of over 40%.

The bumper wheat harvest in Fuqing County is the result of adhering to putting politics in command, giving full play to enthusiasm, and striving for the upper reaches under the leadership of the Party. When sowing wheat last year, the county Party committee called on all localities to launch a campaign of "Wheat catches up with early rice, spring harvest surpasses summer harvest." All localities vigorously developed high-yield fields and pace-setter fields to drive the general fields, and the quality of wheat field sowing was very high. The fields were ploughed four times and harrowed six times, turning deeper than in previous years, implementing reasonable dense planting, seeds were carefully selected, and base fertilizer was applied more sufficiently than in previous years. After the wheat was sown, the Party committee secretaries at all levels took the lead in launching a wheat field management competition campaign. The wheat fields achieved "three haves" (have water, have fertilizer, have people to manage), and the quality of wheat field management was greatly improved. Universal attention was paid to preventing pests and diseases and frost protection, thus winning a bumper harvest.

At present, the entire county is continuing to strengthen the struggle against frost and rust, vigorously grasping the late-stage management of wheat fields, and striving for a greater bumper harvest of all wheat in the county.

Furthermore, the Kuokou Brigade of Chengxiang Commune in Putian has harvested 70 mu of early-sown wheat with an average per-mu yield of 220 jin, an increase of about 30% compared to last year. Among them, the 15 mu of high-yield fields achieved a per-mu yield of 350 jin, an increase of more than 100% compared to last year.

    福建初割丰收麦
    亩产量比前两年大大增加
    据福建日报消息：福建省南部福清县早种的小麦已开始收割。据已收的一千二百三十九亩小麦统计，平均亩产二百一十四斤，比小麦丰产的1958年亩产一百四十七斤，多收了六十七斤，增产四成多。
    福清县小麦丰收是在党的领导下，坚持政治挂帅，大鼓干劲、力争上游的结果，去年播种大小麦时，县委号召各地开展“小麦赶早稻，春收超夏收”运动。各地大搞丰产田、标兵田，带动一般田，麦田播种质量很高。田地经过四犁六耙，翻得比往年深，实行合理密播，种子经过精选，基肥也比往年施得足。麦子播下后，又层层由党委书记挂帅，开展麦田管理竞赛运动，麦田做到“三有”（有水、有肥、有人管），麦田管理质量大大提高，普遍注意预防病虫害和防冻工作，因而夺得了丰收。
    目前，全县正继续加强防霜冻、防锈病的斗争，大抓麦田后期管理，力争全县所有大小麦都获更大丰收。
    又讯，莆田城厢公社阔口大队已收割的七十亩早种小麦平均亩产达到二百二十斤，比去年增产三成左右，其中十五亩丰产田，亩产达到三百五十斤，比去年增产一倍多。
