The Hand of Sino-Soviet Friendship
　　Liu Lanshan
As you return from our great ally, the Soviet Union, the spring breeze is rippling across the land of our motherland;
You extend a new hand forged from sincere friendship, as if to embrace the entire motherland in your heart!
Looking at your handsome and heroic face, an image of bravery appears before my eyes:
In the beautiful southern border region of our motherland, a phoenix soars among the coconut groves—
The enemy nudged the small bamboo gate on the hillside, and you woke up from your dream, unable to find your pistol;
Six ferocious bandits had already crept in, suddenly closing in on an unarmed girl!
Facing the enemy's raised bayonets and gun muzzles, you were fearless and fought back bravely;
As if you were holding a million soldiers in your hand, because the Party had given you invincible strength.
You unfolded a struggle with your bare hands, tightly guarding the country's money box;
The brutal enemy slashed down with a knife, but you still held onto the box!
Nearby comrades were mobilized, setting up a dragnet on all sides.
The heinous enemy was annihilated, and you set a shining example for us!
This is a hand that defends peace and socialism, it joins arms with all socialist builders;
“The enemy cut off your hand, we will reattach it!” Letters and telegrams poured in from fraternal allies.
You were welcomed into silver Chita, the poplars clapped their hands along the way,
The Ingoda River suddenly cheered, you felt like you were back in your beloved Yunnan hometown.
Enthusiastic Soviet brothers and sisters, watched over you day and night;
A new hand suddenly grew from your arms, oh, phoenix, you regained your wings!…
You flew back from beloved Soviet Union, the extended new hand emits a glimmering light,
This is the crystallization of patriotism and internationalism, and it will dedicate even greater strength to socialism.
When we hold your new hand again, it’s like embracing the entire Soviet brotherhood;
Thousands of words cannot express the love in our hearts, let us sing for the forever held high hand of Sino-Soviet friendship!

    中苏友谊之手
    刘岚山当你从伟大的盟邦苏联归来，春风正在祖国的大地上荡漾；你伸出真诚友谊铸成的新手，仿佛要把整个祖国抱在心上！望着你英俊豪迈的面影，我眼前又出现一个勇敢的形象：在美丽的祖国边陲的南方，椰林中有一只腾飞的凤凰——敌人拨动山坡上的小竹门，你从梦中惊醒，没摸到手枪；六个凶恶的残匪已经窜来了，突然进逼一个手无寸铁的姑娘！你面对着敌人举起的刀尖枪口，凛然不惧，奋起抵抗；就好像你手握着千军万马，因为党给了你不可战胜的力量。你用一双赤手展开搏斗，紧紧守护住祖国的银钱箱；凶残的敌人一刀砍下来，你仍然抱着箱子不放！邻近的战友们出动了，四面布下了天罗地网。万恶的敌人被消灭了，你为我们树立了光辉的榜样！这是一双捍卫和平和社会主义的手，它和所有社会主义建设者共着臂膀；
  “敌人砍断你的手，我们把它接起来！”书信和电报纷纷来自兄弟友邦。你被迎进银色的赤塔，白杨树一路上拍着巴掌，音果达河忽然欢呼起来，你就像回到亲爱的云南故乡。热情的苏联兄弟姐妹，日日夜夜地守在你身旁；新的手忽然从双臂上生长出来，哦，凤凰你又获得了翅膀！……你从亲爱的苏联展翅飞回来，伸出的新手发出闪闪的光芒，这是爱国主义和国际主义的结晶，它将为社会主义献出更大力量。当我们重又握着你的新手，就像拥抱着整个苏联兄弟的臂膀；千言万语说不尽心中的热爱，让我们为永远高举的中苏友谊之手歌唱！
