Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 11th: Shandong is actively intensifying spring irrigation work to ensure vigorous wheat regreening.

Currently, in the Weishan, Penglou, and Liulou Yellow River irrigation areas and the Grand Canal irrigation areas of Liaocheng Prefecture, hundreds of thousands of water wells and mechanized wells, as well as tens of thousands of ponds, reservoirs, and ditches, are all releasing water to irrigate wheat fields. After the Spring Festival, Shouzhang, Linqing, Guanxian, Qihe, Pingyuan and other counties and cities have already irrigated over one million mu of wheat fields with regreening water and over ten thousand mu of bare land. Guanxian mobilized 150,000 people to launch a concentrated spring irrigation campaign, with over 80,000 people eating and living in the fields, working day and night in shifts, with tools never resting, having already irrigated over 300,000 mu. Feicheng County in the Jinan area organized over 2,000 irrigation teams, adopting methods such as parallel flow and long-distance irrigation, and drawing water up the mountains, striving to universally irrigate 80,000 mu of mountainous wheat fields lacking water resources with regreening water.

This year, the spring irrigation time in Shandong is approximately 20 days earlier than in previous years. To advance spring irrigation, various regions constructed a large number of small-scale farmland water conservancy projects during winter water conservancy construction last year, which required less investment, less labor, and yielded benefits in the same year. After the Spring Festival, many prefectures, counties, and communes established spring irrigation headquarters, and production brigades and teams in various communes established spring irrigation leading groups and spring irrigation professional teams and groups. Various regions also established and improved water conservancy management organizations, trained management personnel and irrigation workers, water distributors, and drivers of irrigation and drainage machinery, ensuring the smooth progress of spring irrigation work.

Industrial and commercial departments in various regions actively supported spring irrigation work. Commercial departments throughout the province promptly transported 150,000 waterwheels and existing inventory of irrigation and drainage machinery to rural areas; industrial departments organized 19 machinery factories to work day and night to rush-produce 5,860 water-lifting tools and dispatched 630 repair and assembly teams and 3,500 iron and woodworking workers to go deep into the fields for mobile repair of water-lifting tools, supporting rural spring irrigation.

Following closely after spring irrigation, various regions are also vigorously applying regreening fertilizer. The Yishui mountainous area established over 8,000 liquid fertilizer plants and over 400 indigenous fertilizer plants, enabling over 600,000 mu of the county's 840,000 mu of wheat to be fertilized twice, and 140,000 mu to be fertilized three times. Qihe County reformed 16 types of manure accumulation, fertilizer production, fertilizer transportation, and topdressing tools. Each mu of the county's 160,000 mu of wheat fields has been topdressed with 4,000 jin of regreening fertilizer.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 11th: Under the slogan of "Not letting up on a single task, linking every link tightly, and vowing to win a great summer harvest," people's communes in Anhui are organizing over 150,000 field management professional teams, seizing the time to topdress and weed, and fiercely attacking the regreening stage of summer harvest crops.

This year, starting from when the seeds of summer harvest crops were sown, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Party committees at all levels have firmly grasped the experience of "one planting, nine managements, and ten-fold harvest," comprehensively and deeply carrying out a field management campaign centered on topdressing. After December last year, the province launched a new wave of large-scale inspections, assessments, and competitions in field management, universally applying a winter fertilizer to over 50 million mu of summer harvest crops, reducing the proportion of third-class seedlings from 11% of the total wheat area to 5%. Currently, summer harvest crops are generally growing well, with wheat seedlings generally four or five cun high, with four or five tillers per plant, and green everywhere.

Now, various regions are adopting the method of grasping both distant and nearby fields, and managing both high-yield fields and general fields together, to promote good wheat regreening. After inspecting the wheat plants and calculating the accounts, Fuyang Prefecture overcame the blindly optimistic mood of a few people. The entire prefecture now has nearly one million people applying regreening fertilizer to summer harvest crops every day, and irrigating according to soil moisture conditions, to meet the water and fertilizer needs of summer harvest crops during the regreening stage. In order to ensure a summer harvest, Wuhu Prefecture is carrying out a "Four Red" (Red Flag Commune, Red Flag Team, Red Flag Group, Red Flag Field) campaign for summer harvest crop field management. Red Flag fields are required to have full and vigorous seedlings, thick stems and dark green leaves; fields without weeds and with loose soil; clear furrow ditches, neither drought nor waterlogging; no pests or diseases; and high yields and abundant harvests. As of February 5, 17 communes, 2,995 brigades, and 1.75 million mu of summer harvest crops in the prefecture had reached the standards of Red Flag fields. Huaining County in Anqing Prefecture requires that within the next five days, all 470,000 mu of summer harvest crops in the county be topdressed, weeded, and ditches cleared once more on the basis of the two previous topdressings and weedings. At present, the county has fixed over 70,000 laborers to strengthen summer harvest crop field management, and has topdressed and weeded 170,000 mu in two days.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 11th: According to the new situation of wheat growth this year, communes in Shaanxi, under the slogan of "early irrigation of regreening water, early application of regreening fertilizer, early prevention of pests and diseases, and early prevention of spring frost damage," have launched a high tide of wheat regreening management centered on spring irrigation to combat drought, about one month earlier than last year. According to incomplete statistics, since the Spring Festival, the province has irrigated more than 2.2 million mu of wheat, cultivated and rolled more than 1.2 million mu, and treated most of the wheat fields with stripe rust. Thanks to the meticulous winter management, wheat seedlings throughout the province are generally growing strongly, with first-class seedlings accounting for 63%, second-class seedlings accounting for 28.5%, and third-class seedlings accounting for only 8.5%; moreover, the growth of this year's third-class seedlings is similar to last year's second-class seedlings.

On the one hand, Shaanxi wheat is generally growing well due to good autumn planting and meticulous winter management; on the other hand, it has encountered a hundred-day winter drought, high temperatures, and high evaporation of soil moisture, resulting in widespread water shortage. Many wheat plants have advanced their regreening time, some even thriving in winter; pests and diseases are occurring earlier than in previous years. Based on these new circumstances, various regions are universally mobilizing the masses to vigorously carry out spring irrigation and topdressing, taking advantage of soil moisture to cultivate and roll the soil in spring, preserve soil moisture, and enhance the wheat's ability to resist cold and lodging. At the same time, they are vigorously eliminating rust, pests, and emerged weeds. In vigorously grasping wheat regreening management, the confidence and enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members have doubled. A campaign to fiercely attack the regreening stage, centered on drought-resistant spring irrigation, on an even larger scale than winter field management, has been launched with great vigor. Various regions have universally convened four-level and five-level cadre meetings or mobilization meetings of ten thousand or hundreds of thousands of people to fiercely attack the wheat regreening stage, and dispatched a large number of cadres to production teams to strengthen the force on the front line of production. During the Spring Festival holiday, more than 1,200 cadres in Sanyuan County went deep into the countryside to mobilize commune members to vigorously carry out wheat field spring irrigation and various management tasks. Of the county's 1.18 million mu of wheat fields, 539,000 mu were irrigated in four days by February 4; 154,000 mu were irrigated by carrying ice and water; 824,000 mu have been topdressed twice, 839,000 mu have been cultivated and weeded, and 239,000 mu have been treated for rust. The people's communes in the suburbs of Tongchuan City rolled the 250,000 mu of winter-thriving wheat before the Spring Festival, and continued rolling after the Spring Festival. Communes in Shangluo Prefecture promptly treated wheat fields with underground pests and red spiders. In order to prevent frost from attacking the wheat, Dali County has dug a frost prevention kiln in every five mu of wheat fields, with 100 jin of grass in each kiln, which can be ignited to resist frost when frost comes.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 11th: As the earth returns to spring, people's communes in various wheat-producing areas of Shanxi are seizing the opportunity to irrigate regreening water early, apply regreening fertilizer, roll wheat fields while the soil is still freezing, fiercely attack the wheat regreening stage, and strive for a bumper wheat harvest this year.

Spring drought has already emerged in Shanxi. Since November last year, snowfall in various regions has been less than in normal years. Therefore, various regions are grasping watering and rolling to preserve soil moisture in the fierce attack on the wheat regreening stage, while also applying a large amount of topdressing and preventing pests and diseases as early as possible. Under the slogan of "Catching up with the fallow with the regular crop, catching up with the irrigated land with the dry land, catching up with the plains with the mountains, and catching up with the first class with the third class," the people's communes in Jishan County mobilized more than 100,000 commune members to strengthen the management of wheat fields during the regreening period. More than 54,000 mu of wheat fields in the county have been irrigated with regreening water, 80% of the wheat fields have been rolled while the soil is still freezing, and 200,000 mu of wheat fields have been topdressed with regreening fertilizer. According to the insufficient soil moisture in the wheat fields, the communes in Licheng County organized 6,000 head of livestock and more than 12,000 commune members to carry out a concentrated rolling campaign to preserve soil moisture. In a few days, all 130,000 mu of wheat in the county were universally rolled once, and 21,000 mu of irrigated wheat fields were all watered once. When watering, rolling, and topdressing wheat fields, the Lizhai People's Commune in Yicheng County also organized a team to prevent and control pests and diseases in wheat fields with rust, so the wheat fields generally had loose topsoil, sufficient fertilizer and water in the soil, and no weeds or pests on the edges of the fields. The people's communes in various regions have prepared enough fertilizer for wheat regreening this year. In addition to the more than 60 dan of topdressing already applied per mu of wheat, another 50 dan can be applied, and most of these fertilizers have been transported to the fields.

    早管多管细管小麦　力夺夏季更大丰收
    送水送肥送小麦过好返青关
    山东春灌比往年提早二十天左右　安徽全面抓紧管好丰产田一般田
    陕西早施水肥早防病害早防春冻　山西突击浇水同时突击耙耱保墒
    山东
    新华社济南11日电　山东各地积极加紧春灌工作，确保小麦旺盛返青。
    目前，聊城专区位山、彭楼、刘楼等引黄灌区和卫运河灌区的数十万眼水井和机井，以及数万个塘、库、沟渠都一齐放水赶浇麦田。寿张、临清、冠县、齐河、平原等县、市春节后已浇小麦返青水一百多万亩，浇白茬地十余万亩。冠县出动了十五万人突击春灌，有八万多人吃住在田间日夜轮作，歇人不歇工具，已浇地三十多万亩。济南地区的肥城县组织两千多个浇地队，采用并流远浇，引水上山等办法，力争给八万亩缺乏水源的山地麦田普遍浇一次返青水。
    今年山东各地春灌时间较往年提早了二十天左右。为了提早春灌，各地在去年冬修水利中都兴建了大量花钱少、费工少、当年收益的小型农田水利。春节以后，不少地、县、社建立了春灌指挥部，各公社生产大队建立了春灌领导小组和春灌专业队、组；各地还建立与健全了水利管理组织，培训了管理人员和灌水员、配水员、排灌机械司机手等，使春灌工作顺利进行。
    各地工、商业部门积极支援春灌工作。全省商业部门已将十五万部水车和现有库存的排灌机械及时运送到农村；工业部门组织十九个机械厂星夜赶制提水工具五千八百六十部，并派遣了六百三十个修配小组和三千五百名铁木工人深入田间巡回修理提水工具，支援农村春浇。
    紧跟着春灌之后，各地又大追返青肥。沂水山区建立了八千多处液体肥料厂、四百多处土化肥厂，使全县八十四万亩小麦有六十多万亩追肥两遍，十四万亩追了三遍肥。齐河县改革了十六种积肥、造肥、运肥、追肥工具，全县十六万亩麦田，每亩已追了四千斤返青肥。安徽
    新华社合肥11日电　安徽各地人民公社在“一着不让，环环扣紧，誓夺夏季大丰收”的口号下，组织十五万多个田间管理专业队，抓紧追肥锄草，猛攻夏收作物返青关。
    今年安徽省的夏收作物从种子落地开始，中共安徽省委和各级党委就紧紧地抓住“一种九管十成收”这条丰产经验，全面深入地开展以追肥为中心的田间管理运动。去年12月以后，全省又掀起了大检查、大评比、大竞赛的田间管理热潮，给五千多万亩夏收作物普遍施了一次腊肥，使三类苗由原来占麦田总面积11％下降到5％。目前夏收作物普遍生长良好，麦苗一般高四、五寸，每株分蘖四、五个，到处一片葱绿。
    现在，各地又采取远田近田一齐抓，丰产田一般田一齐管的办法，促使小麦很好返青。阜阳专区通过查棵算账以后，克服了少数人的盲目乐观情绪，全区现在每天有近百万群众给夏收作物追施返青肥，并根据墒情进行灌溉，以满足夏收作物返青阶段对水、肥的需要。芜湖专区为确保夏季丰收，正在开展夏收作物田间管理“四红”（即红旗社、红旗队、红旗组、红旗田）运动。要求红旗田做到苗全苗旺，秆粗叶乌；田无杂草，土壤疏松；畦沟清，不旱不涝；无病虫害；高产多收。到2月5日止，全区已有十七个公社，二千九百九十五个大队，一百七十五万亩夏收作物达到了红旗田的标准。安庆专区怀宁县要求在最近五天内将全县四十七万亩夏收作物在已经追肥、锄草二交的基础上，再追肥、锄草、清沟一次。目前全县已固定七万多个劳力加强夏收作物田间管理，两天中就追肥锄草达十七万亩。
    陕西
    新华社西安11日电　陕西各地公社根据今年小麦生长的新情况，在“早浇返青水，早施返青肥，早防病虫害，早防春冻害”的“四早”口号下，比去年提前一个月左右掀起了以春灌抗旱为中心的小麦返青管理高潮。据不完全统计，全省从春节到现在，已灌溉小麦二百二十多万亩，中耕、碾耱一百二十多万亩，大部分发生条锈病的麦田都经过了防治。由于越冬管理搞得细，全省麦苗普遍生长茁壮，一类苗占63％，二类苗占28．5％，三类苗只占8．5％；而且今年的三类苗生长情况和去年的二类苗差不多。
    陕西小麦一方面由于去秋种得好，越冬管理搞得细，当前普遍生长良好；另一方面，遇到百日冬旱，气温高，地里水分蒸发量大，普遍缺水。许多小麦提早了返青时间，有的甚至冬旺；病虫害发生比往年早。根据这些新情况，各地普遍发动群众大抓春灌和追肥，趁墒春锄、春耱，保住墒土，增强小麦抗冻、抗倒伏的能力。同时，大力消灭锈病、虫害和已长出来的杂草，在大抓小麦返青管理中，广大社员的信心和干劲倍增，一个比冬季田间管理规模更大的以抗旱春灌为中心的大战返青关运动，便轰轰烈烈地开展起来。各地普遍召开了四级、五级干部会或万人、几十万人的猛攻小麦返青关进军会，抽调了大批干部到生产小队，加强生产第一线的力量。三原县在春节假期有一千二百多名干部深入农村，发动社员大搞麦田春灌和各项管理工作。这个县的一百一十八万亩麦田，到2月4日四天内就灌溉了五十三点九万亩；背冰润田、担水泼浇十五点四万亩；有八十二点四万亩施过了二次追肥，八十三点九万亩经过中耕除草，二十三点九万亩防治过锈病。铜川市郊各人民公社，在春节前就对二十五万亩冬旺的小麦进行了耙耱碾压，春节后又继续碾压。商雒专区各公社及时防治了发生地下害虫和红蜘蛛的麦田。大荔县为了预防霜冻袭击小麦，已在每五亩麦田中挖好一座防霜窑，每窑放草一百斤，霜冻一来，就能点火抗御。
    山西
    新华社太原11日电　大地回春，山西各产麦区人民公社抓紧时机，提早灌溉返青水，追施返青肥，顶凌耙耱麦田，猛攻小麦返青关，力争今年小麦大丰收。
    山西春旱已经露头。从去年11月以来，各地降雪量比常年少，因此，各地在猛攻小麦返青关中都抓紧浇水和耙耱保墒，同时大量追肥和及早防治病虫害。稷山县各人民公社在回茬赶正茬、旱地赶水地、山地赶平川、三类赶一类的“四赶”口号下，出动十万多名社员加强了麦田返青期的管理，全县已有五万四千多亩麦田浇了返青水，有80％的麦田经过顶凌耙耱，有二十万亩麦田追了返青肥。黎城县各公社根据麦田底墒不足的情况，组织了六千犋牲口，一万二千多名社员突击耙耱保墒。几天中给全县十三万多亩小麦普遍耙耱了一遍，二万一千多亩水地麦田都浇过一次水。翼城县里砦人民公社在给麦田浇水、耙耱和追肥时，还组织了一支防治病虫害的队伍在发生锈病的麦田里进行防治工作，因此麦田普遍表土松绵、地内肥水足，地边无杂草无虫害。各地人民公社今年为小麦返青准备了足够的肥料，每亩麦田除已经施过六十多担追肥外，还能再追施五十担，这些肥料绝大部分已经运送下地。
