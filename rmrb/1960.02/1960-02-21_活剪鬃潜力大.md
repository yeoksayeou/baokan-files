Live hog bristle clipping is being widely carried out in Hanshou County, Hunan Province.

In March of last year, in order to open up sources of hog bristles, the Hanshou County Commercial Bureau conducted clipping trials on the livestock farms of the Potou and Zhuan'an brigades of the Yazi Port Commune. The livestock farms of the two brigades each clipped ten pigs, obtaining a total of 33 taels of bristles, all of which were grade A and special grade bristles, worth more than twelve yuan, with an average income of 6 jiao and 2 fen per pig. The Hanshou County Commercial Bureau, based on the trials in the two locations, calculated that if all the 24,700 breeding sows and boars in the county were clipped, more than 2,500 jin of bristles could be obtained. At an average price of five yuan per jin, this would increase the income of the commune by 12,765 yuan.

    活剪鬃潜力大
    活猪剪鬃这个工作正在湖南省汉寿县普遍开展。
    去年3月份，汉寿县商业局为开辟猪鬃货源，在鸭子港公社的坡头与竹岸两个大队的畜牧场作剪鬃试点。两个大队畜牧场各试剪了十头猪，共剪鬃三十三两，都是甲级和特级鬃，价值十二元多，平均每头猪收入六角二分。汉寿县商业局根据两处的试点算了一笔账，按全县现有公母种猪二万四千七百多头计算，可剪鬃二千五百多斤，平均每斤以五元计算，就可为公社增加收入一万二千七百六十五元。
