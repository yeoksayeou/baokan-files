The Jiuling People's Commune is located in the southeastern Hubei's large mountainous area, where the mountains are high and the weather is cold. Climatically speaking, spring here should arrive later than in the plains; however, the opposite is true. This year, the spring in Jiuling Commune arrived earlier than in most areas. Consider that in just fifty days, the commune members consecutively completed the "Shenlong," "Henglong," and "Zhiquan" reservoirs, filling them with water to irrigate more than 50,000 mu of farmland through gravity flow. Barren mountains and wild ridges from just months ago have now been transformed into layers of terraced fields, all planted with crops. Not only are more summer harvest crops planted, but they are also well-managed. Although the sown area has leaped from more than 8,000 mu last year to more than 70,000 mu, the management is very meticulous, and the green seedlings in the fields are growing robustly and neatly, which is quite pleasing to the eye. Let's take a look at the "Five Beauties Picture" of Jiuling Commune's spring plowing preparation: First, fertilizer accumulation. Sufficient fertilizer has been prepared for the planned planting of more than 34,000 mu of early and mid-season rice, averaging nearly 200 dan per mu, and most of the fertilizer has been transported to the fields; second, field preparation. All 11,000 mu of winter fallow fields have been plowed and harrowed twice, and nearly 4,000 mu of rice seedling fields have been plowed and harrowed four times, and also soaked in water; third, seeds. All the seeds needed for spring sowing have been self-sufficiently produced and stored in special warehouses; fourth, tools. More than 100,000 large and small farm tools have been repaired and replenished; fifth, technology. All 57 technical night schools in the commune are stepping up training in rice transplanting skills and the use of new farm tools, and are further carrying out a mass technical innovation debate. Who dares to say "Spring comes late in high and cold mountainous areas?" This is clearly "Five Perfections Make for an Early Spring!"

　　The achievements made by Jiuling Commune are by no means accidental, and are a manifestation of the superiority of the People's Commune. Under the unified leadership of the People's Commune, the members of Jiuling Commune were not intimidated by the arduous winter production tasks. They were full of enthusiasm and put forward the heroic slogan: "Mountains are not high if we have soaring enthusiasm, let the high tide be even higher, Jiuling people show their heroism." They took "Three Controls" as the center, driving other work, adopted the method of organizing large-scale cooperation, unified deployment of forces, achieved prominence of the center and comprehensive leap forward, and concentrated superior forces to besiege wherever there were difficulties, achieved step-by-step initiative, and leading in everything, resulting in a good situation of "one horse taking the lead, ten thousand horses galloping."

　　The "Five Perfections" scene of Jiuling Commune is a vivid portrayal of "the east wind blowing strongly, and spring arriving early", and is also a good start for striving for a continued leap forward in agricultural production in 1960.

    五全其美春光早
    一凡
    九岭公社在湖北东南部的大山区，山高气寒。如果按气候来说，这里的春天要比平原地区来得晚一些；可是，事实恰恰相反，今年九岭公社的春天比一般地区来得早。请看，仅在五十天内，九岭公社的社员们接连修成了“神龙”、“横龙”、“治泉”三座大水库，并且蓄满了水，自流灌溉着五万多亩农田；几个月前的荒山野岭，如今变成层层叠叠的梯田、梯地，全部种上了庄稼。夏收作物不仅种得多，管得也好，尽管播种面积由去年的八千多亩一跃而扩大到七万多亩，但管得非常细致，田里的青苗长得茁壮整齐，煞是好看。再看看九岭公社备耕的“五美图”吧：一是积肥，已为计划播种的三万四千多亩早、中稻准备了充足的肥料，平均每亩近二百担，并且已把绝大部分肥料运到田里；二是整田，一万一千亩冬闲田全部做到两犁两耙，近四千亩育秧田做到四犁四耙、还泡上了水；三是种籽，全部春播所需种籽已经作到自给自足，专仓保管；四是工具，大小农具十万多件，全部修补、添置就绪；五是技术，全社五十七所技术夜校，正在加紧训练插秧能力和新式农具手，并且进一步开展了全民性技术革新大辩论。谁敢说“高寒山区春来迟？”这分明是“五全其美春光早”呵！
    九岭公社做出这些成绩，绝不是偶然的，这是人民公社优越性的表现。在人民公社统一领导下，九岭公社的社员们没有被繁重的冬季生产任务所吓倒，他们干劲冲天，提出了豪迈的口号：“山高不算高，干劲冲云霄，高潮要更高，九岭人民逞英豪。”他们以“三治”为中心，带动了其他工作，采取组织大协作的办法，统一部署力量，做到中心突出、全面跃进，哪里有困难，就集优势力量围攻哪里，做到步步主动，事事领先，出现了“一马当先，万马奔腾”的大好形势。
    九岭公社“五全其美”的盛景，正是“东风劲吹，春光早临”的生动写照，也是争取1960年农业生产继续跃进的良好开端。
