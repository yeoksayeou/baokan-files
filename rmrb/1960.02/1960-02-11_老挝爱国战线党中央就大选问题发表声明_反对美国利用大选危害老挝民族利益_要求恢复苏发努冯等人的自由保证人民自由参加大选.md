Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 9th: The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a statement on February 3rd regarding the Lao general election to be held in April.

The statement expressed strong opposition to the U.S. imperialists, the heads of the Lao "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," and other loyal running dogs of the U.S., who are modifying the election law and election methods, and to all conspiracies of fraud and repression during the election. It demanded that the general election be conducted in accordance with the election law previously passed by the National Assembly.

The statement strongly demanded the immediate release of Prince Souphanouvong and other members of the Lao Patriotic Front from illegal imprisonment, so that they can participate in the election campaign in a timely manner. It demanded an immediate end to the killing and persecution of the people, an immediate end to the civil war, and a guarantee that the people can participate in the general election democratically, freely, and safely. It further stated that, to this end, negotiations must be held between the two sides.

The statement said that the Lao Patriotic Front has always placed the highest interests of the motherland and the people first, and it is always ready to support and cooperate with all political parties and individuals who sincerely wish to strive for Laos to truly move towards a path of peace and neutrality.

The statement of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front was published in the "Lao Patriotic News" on February 5th. The statement pointed out that this Lao general election is being conducted under unstable circumstances. The motherland is being devastated by civil war, and the people are being subjected to increasingly brutal "sweeps" and persecutions. Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, as well as many cadres, have been illegally imprisoned, and thousands of patriotic and peace-loving people are also being subjected to illegal persecution. The people's democratic and free rights are being seriously undermined. More seriously, the heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," at the instigation of U.S. imperialism, recently carried out a military coup, dissolved the National Assembly, and brazenly declared the abolition of the rights of the National Assembly and its members, seriously undermining the Kingdom's constitution and laws, violating the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, and making the situation in Laos more complex and difficult.

The statement said that if the current situation is not changed, then the heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" and other running dogs of U.S. imperialism will certainly commit fraud in this election, restrict the people's democratic, free, and electoral rights, and they will threaten and lure the people, or mobilize troops, police, and use the government to persecute them, forcing the people to vote for them.

The statement said that, currently, under the pressure of U.S. imperialism, the Lao Kingdom government has already revised the election law and the method of general elections. This revision completely violates the constitution and the election law already passed by the National Assembly. This is an act they have taken arbitrarily, recklessly bypassing the National Assembly, which is the highest legislative body of the country. The purpose of this extremely reactionary action is to cancel the people's democratic and free rights, allowing them to commit fraud at will.

The statement further pointed out that the revision of the election law and election methods is part of a conspiracy by U.S. imperialism, which attempts to squeeze out forces that love the motherland, love peace, and progress, and create a National Assembly consisting of pro-American reactionaries, thereby establishing a warlordist dictatorship in Laos, suppressing the Lao people's revolutionary movement, and turning Laos into a U.S. colony and military base. The statement said that if the general election is conducted under the conditions of a revised election law, the new National Assembly will certainly include many elements that bring disaster to the country and harm the people, the situation in the country will become more complex and deteriorated, the lives and property of the people of all ethnic groups in Laos will be subjected to more serious harm, and the peace of Indochina and Southeast Asia will be subjected to a more serious threat.

After explaining the attitude of the Lao Patriotic Front, the statement said that this general election is of great importance, and in order to save the fate of the country, every Lao citizen has an obligation to fight for the complete exercise of their rights.

    老挝爱国战线党中央就大选问题发表声明
    反对美国利用大选危害老挝民族利益
    要求恢复苏发努冯等人的自由保证人民自由参加大选
    据新华社河内9日电　老挝爱国战线党中央委员会2月3日就将在4月间举行老挝大选发表了声明。
    声明表示竭力反对美帝国主义、老挝“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们和美国的其他忠实走狗修改选举法和选举方式，以及对选举时舞弊和实行镇压的一切阴谋；要求根据国民议会过去已经通过的选举法进行普选。
    声明强烈要求立即恢复苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他议员的自由，让他们及时参加竞选。要求立即停止残杀和迫害人民，立即停止内战，保证人民民主地、自由地和安全地参加大选。并且表明，为此，双方必须举行谈判。
    声明说，老挝爱国战线党一向以祖国和人民的最高利益为重，它随时准备支持各个诚心愿为老挝真正走向和平中立道路而奋斗的政党和个人，并和他们合作。
    老挝爱国战线党中央的声明刊载在2月5日出版的“老挝爱国新闻”上。声明指出，老挝这次大选是在局势不安定的情况下进行的。祖国由于内战正受到破坏，人民正遭到越来越残暴的“扫荡”和迫害。苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人以及许多干部被非法监禁，成千名爱国爱和平的人民也正受到非法的迫害，人民的民主自由权利正遭受严重的损害。更严重的是，“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们在美帝国主义的唆使下，不久前实行了军事政变，解散国会，悍然宣称取消国会和议员的权利，严重地破坏了王国宪法和法律，破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议，使老挝局势变得更加复杂和困难。
    声明说，如果目前的局势不加以改变，那么“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们和美帝国主义的其他走狗将一定会在这次选举中舞弊，限制人民的民主、自由和选举权利，他们将对人民进行威胁利诱或者调动军队、警察和运用政权进行迫害，迫使人民投他们的票。
    声明说，目前，在美帝国主义的压力下，老挝王国政府已经修改了选举法和普选的方式。这种修改完全违反宪法和国民议会已经通过的选举法。这是他们肆无忌惮地避开作为国家的最高立法机关的国民议会而擅自采取的行动。这个极其反动的行动的目的，在于取消人民的民主自由权利，让他们任意舞弊。
    声明进一步指出，选举法和选举方式的修改，是美帝国主义的阴谋的一部分，它企图排挤爱祖国、爱和平和进步的力量，制造一个包括亲美的反动分子的国民议会，从而在老挝建立军阀主义的独裁制度，镇压老挝人民的革命运动，把老挝变成美国的殖民地和军事基地。声明说，如果大选是在选举法被修改的条件下进行，新的国民议会一定会包括许多祸国殃民的分子，国家的局势将更加复杂和恶化，老挝各族人民的生命和财产将受到更严重的危害，印度支那和东南亚的和平将受到更严重的威胁。
    声明在说明了老挝爱国战线党的态度后说，这次大选是关系重大的，为了挽救国家的命运，每个老挝公民有义务为彻底行使自己的权利而斗争。
