The deeds are heart-stirring, and the methods are diverse: Factories allocate a portion of their resources and provide equipment to help counties and communes establish factories; factories unsuitable for urban locations are transferred to counties and communes; surplus equipment and materials are provided to counties and communes; technical personnel are trained for counties and communes using methods such as "dispatching, mentoring, and training." The First Machine Tool Plant establishes "amateur small factories," where workers use their spare time and leftover materials to produce machinery for rural areas on a large scale.
    (Our dispatch from Harbin, February 25) Factories and enterprises in Harbin are adopting methods of contracted support and direct collaboration with rural people's communes to vigorously support agricultural technical transformation and commune industrialization.
    On the one hand, large and small factories and enterprises in Harbin are adopting methods of "district-supports-county" and "factory-supports-commune," establishing collaborative relationships with rural people's communes in the nearby suburban areas and the surrounding four county-level cities. On the other hand, twenty-four large and medium-sized factories, including the state-owned First Machine Tool Plant, have established collaborative relationships with twenty-four counties in Heilongjiang, such as Suihua, Wuchang, and Hailun.
    Harbin's factories and enterprises have adopted various forms to support agricultural technical transformation and commune industrialization: (1) "Branching out and laying eggs." This involves allocating a portion of the factory's workshops to supplement the deficiencies in county and commune industries, or the factory is responsible for providing a complete set of equipment and technical personnel to help counties and communes establish factories. For example, the Harbin Bearing Factory adopted the "branching out" method, allocating a portion of its bearing workshop to attach to the machinery factories in Acheng and Bin counties, producing bearings needed for agricultural machinery in these two counties. The Harbin Second Tool Factory and the Sharp Tool Factory adopted the "laying eggs" method, jointly helping the four county-level cities under the jurisdiction of Harbin to establish four tool factories, so that the agricultural and industrial needs of these four counties for tools such as files and pliers can be basically self-sufficient. (2) "Relocating factories." That is, according to the principle of "four services and three localizations" (serving large industries, serving agriculture, serving people's lives, and serving export trade; and using local materials, local production, and local sales), a batch of factories that are not suitable for establishment in cities are transferred to counties and communes to supplement county and commune industries. A number of factories in Harbin have already been relocated from the city to counties or communes, and the city plans to relocate 131 factories to counties and communes before May 1st. (3) Through vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution, the saved equipment and materials are used to support counties and communes. For example, the Harbin Cement Plant helped the Dongfeng Commune establish a cement plant with an annual output of 10,000 tons, but it lacked a 180 kVA transformer. Nangang District needed to mechanize pig farming, lacking more than 2,000 meters of wire. This time, both problems were solved by the electrical equipment saved after the promotion of ring power supply in Harbin. (4) Taking measures such as "sending, mentoring, and training" to help counties and communes train technical personnel. Currently, more than 7,000 rural youths from counties and communes in Heilongjiang Province are learning to drive and repair tractors and automobiles, and to operate lathes, milling machines, planers, and electrical work in various factories and enterprises in Harbin. Harbin's factories have also sent a group of technicians and veteran workers to various counties and communes to mentor apprentices while helping to build factories.
    At present, Harbin's factories and enterprises have helped the counties and communes they are supporting to establish 58 medium and small-sized machinery factories, tool factories, cement plants, etc.; helped solve the problem of pumps, power, and other irrigation and drainage machinery and equipment for 325 water conservancy projects in the suburbs, benefiting 110,000 mu of farmland; and helped nearly 100,000 commune members in 83 management districts to obtain electric lighting.
    In supporting agricultural technical transformation and commune industrialization, factories and enterprises have fully demonstrated the communist spirit. Leading cadres of many factories and enterprises in Taiping District and other places personally led working groups to go deep into the counties and communes they were supporting to understand the industrial support needed for agriculture. In the large-scale water conservancy project in the suburbs, leading cadres of enterprises such as Harbin Forestry Machinery Plant, Steam Turbine Plant, Boiler Plant, and First Machine Tool Plant personally participated in the labor. In order to help the water conservancy construction site improve efficiency, some actively brought their own excavators, bulldozers, winches, etc. to support, greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of the construction workers.
    (Our dispatch from Harbin, February 25) The state-owned Harbin First Machine Tool Plant, through the mass movement to establish "amateur small factories," manufactures and repairs agricultural machinery for rural areas, supporting agricultural technical transformation. According to statistics, since October last year, the factory has manufactured and repaired 16 various machine tools, manufactured 75 agricultural machines, repaired 28 agricultural machines, and manufactured more than 2,800 small agricultural tools and parts for rural areas in Harbin's suburbs, Zhaodong, Hulan, Bin County, Zhaoyuan and other counties, with a total output value of more than 125,000 yuan.
    The amateur small factories of the state-owned Harbin First Machine Tool Plant to support agricultural technical transformation began to be established as early as the spring of 1958. At that time, there were three such factories, with a total of more than 200 workers participating, which played a significant role in supporting agricultural drought resistance and agricultural transportation bearingization. In 1958 alone, more than 60,000 work hours were used to manufacture agricultural machinery, and more than 6,000 people participated in agricultural production labor on holidays. Not long ago, the factory carried out in-depth propaganda and education among the workers on industrial support for agricultural technical transformation, and the workers actively signed up to participate in the amateur small factories. Now, the number of amateur small factories has developed from three to nineteen, and the number of participating workers has increased to more than 1,700. These amateur factories are established according to normal production organization, with workshops and work sections as units, with the workshop director, foreman, or party and Communist Youth League branch secretary serving as the factory director, and three to five people elected by the masses to serve as part-time management cadres for production, finance, technology, and materials. The main task of these nineteen amateur small factories is to manufacture and repair agricultural machinery for rural areas in spare time or after work, using leftover materials from normal production, while ensuring the completion of state tasks.
    The state-owned Harbin First Machine Tool Plant has adopted the form of establishing amateur small factories, which has maintained the vigorous mass movement to support agriculture on a regular and lasting basis. The employees participating in the amateur small factories have demonstrated a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm. Seventeen workers in the amateur small factory of the machining workshop created a simple machine tool and a drill press overnight. More than 20 workers in the amateur small factory of the repair workshop used their spare time to make 50 bean cake crushing machines in fifteen days; when there was no angle steel when manufacturing the bean cake crushing machine, they went to the scrap pile to find it, and eleven people spent five or six days of their spare time picking up more than three tons of suitable angle steel, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient materials. In mid-January this year, according to the request of the farmers of the Dongfeng Management District to "eat New Year's dumplings under electric lights," the amateur small factory of the repair workshop immediately sent a commando team composed of sixteen electrical workers, who, after thirteen days of hard work, laid seven kilometers of electric wires, making the seven natural villages in this management district fully electrified from power, lighting, telephone to wired broadcasting. After they returned, they used the four-day Spring Festival holiday to rush to complete the production tasks left behind during the thirteen days of absence. When the lights were turned on in this management district on the eve of the Spring Festival, the farmers were all overjoyed, and the whole village was almost sleepless all night. The farmers were filled with joy for the support of the worker elder brothers, and they said: Thousands of lines, thousands of lights, the closest are the worker-peasant brothers!
    The state-owned Harbin First Machine Tool Plant has always paid attention to strengthening mutual support and cooperation with rural areas in recent years. The party and government leaders of the factory often go to the countryside to understand the needs of the rural areas, and continuously strengthen the close ties between the factory and the rural areas through organizing technical teams and medical teams to go to the countryside, festival visits and gatherings, and inviting farmers to the factory for discussions; especially since the establishment of amateur small factories to support agriculture in 1958, the factory and the rural people's communes have become more closely connected.

    哈尔滨工厂包干支援公社
    事迹动人心弦，方式多种多样：从工厂中分出一部分力量和提供设备帮助县、社建立工厂；把一批不适宜建立在城市的工厂下放到县、社；把节余的设备、材料支援县、社；用“派、带、培”等方法帮助县、社培训技术力量。第一机器制造厂建立“业余小工厂”，工人用工余时间和边材余料为农村大造机械
    本报哈尔滨25日电　哈尔滨市区各工厂企业采取分片包干、直接和农村人民公社挂钩协作的办法，大力支援农业技术改造和公社工业化。
    哈尔滨市各大小工厂企业一方面采取“区包县”、“厂包社”的办法，分别和近郊区农村人民公社以及周围四个市属县挂钩协作；另一方面，全市的国营第一机器制造厂等二十四个大中型工厂，又与黑龙江绥化、五常、海伦等二十四个县分别建立起挂钩协作关系。
    哈尔滨市各工厂企业支援农业技术改造和公社工业化采取了多种多样的形式：（1）“分枝、下蛋”。即从工厂的车间中分出一部分力量去充实县、社工业的缺门，或由工厂负责提供全套设备、技术力量帮助县、社建立工厂。像哈尔滨轴承厂就是采取“分枝”办法，从轴承车间分出一部分，附设到阿城和宾县两个县的机械厂，生产这两个县农业机具所需要的轴承。哈尔滨第二工具厂和锋利工具厂则采取“下蛋”办法，共同帮助市属四个县建立了四个工具厂，使这四个县的农业和工业所需的锉刀、钳子等工具基本上可以做到自给。（2）
  “迁厂”。即根据地方工业“四为三就”（即为大工业、为农业、为人民生活、为出口贸易服务和就地取材、就地生产、就地销售）的方针，把一批不适宜建立在城市的工厂下放到县、社，充实县、社工业。哈尔滨市目前已有一批工厂由市内迁县或公社，全市准备在“五一”前迁到县、社的工厂有一百三十一个。（3）通过大闹技术革新和技术革命，把节省下来的设备、材料支援县、社。像哈尔滨水泥厂帮助东风公社建立了一个年产万吨的水泥厂，但缺少一台一百八十千伏安变压器；南岗区要实现养猪机械化，缺少两千多米电线，这次都从哈尔滨市推广环行供电后节省下来的电器设备中得到了解决。（4）采取“派、带、培”等方法帮助县、社培训技术力量。现在，黑龙江省各县、社共有七千多名农村青年，正在哈尔滨各工厂企业中学习拖拉机和汽车的驾驶、修理，学习车、铣、钳、刨、电等工种的操作技术。哈尔滨市各工厂也派了一批技术人员和老工人到各县、社去，在帮助建厂的同时带徒弟。
    目前，哈尔滨市各工厂企业已帮助他们所挂钩协作的县和公社建立起中小型机械厂、工具厂、水泥厂等五十八处；帮助市郊三百二十五处水利工程解决了水泵、动力等排灌机械设备，使受益的农田达到十一万亩；帮助八十三个管理区近十万社员得到了电力照明。
    在支援农业技术改造和公社工业化中，各工厂企业充分发挥了共产主义风格。太平区等很多工厂企业的领导干部亲自带领工作组深入和他们挂钩的县、社，了解农业需要工业支援的情况。在郊区大修水利工程中，哈尔滨林业机械厂、汽轮机厂、锅炉厂、第一机器制造厂等企业的领导干部，都亲自参加劳动，为了帮助水利工地提高工效，有的积极把本厂的掘土机、推土机、卷扬机等开去支援，大大鼓舞了工地民工的情绪。
    本报哈尔滨25日电　国营哈尔滨第一机器制造厂通过大搞群众运动建立“业余小工厂”的形式，为农村制造和修理农业机械，支援农业的技术改造。据统计，从去年10月以来，这个厂共为哈尔滨市郊区、肇东、呼兰、宾县、肇源等县农村制造和修理各种机床十六部，制造农业机器七十五台，检修农业机器二十八台，制造小型农具、配件等二千八百多件，生产总值达十二万五千多元。
    国营哈尔滨第一机器制造厂支援农业技术改造的业余小工厂早在1958年春天就开始成立，当时共有三个这样的工厂，参加的工人共二百多人，对支援农业抗旱、农业运输轴承化起了很大的作用。1958年仅用来制造农业机器的工时就达六万多小时，假日参加农业生产劳动的达六千多人次。不久以前，这个厂又在工人群众中深入地开展了工业支援农业技术改造的宣传教育，工人们纷纷报名要求参加业余小工厂。现在，业余小工厂已由三个发展到十九个，参加的工人增加到一千七百多人。这种业余工厂，是按照正常生产组织，以车间和工段为单位建立的，由车间主任、工长或党团的支部书记任厂长，并由群众推选三人到五人，担任生产、财务、技术和材料等兼职管理干部。这十九个业余小工厂，包括了农业机器制造、电气、木工、工具等九种行业。业余小工厂的主要任务是在保证完成国家任务的同时，在业余或工余时间利用正常生产中的边材余料为农村制造和修理农业机械。
    国营哈尔滨第一机器制造厂由于采取了建立业余小工厂的形式，使轰轰烈烈的支援农业的群众运动保持了经常和持久。参加业余小工厂的职工发挥了高度的革命积极性。机械加工车间业余小工厂的十七名工人一夜就突击创造出简易机床、钻床各一台。机修车间业余小工厂二十多名工人，利用业余时间，在十五天中就做出豆饼粉碎机五十台；在制造豆饼粉碎机时没有角钢，他们就到废料堆里去找，十一个人用五、六天的业余时间拣了合用的角钢三吨多，克服了材料不足的困难。今年1月中旬，机修车间的业余小工厂根据东风管理区农民提出的“要在电灯下吃年夜饺子”的要求，立即派出由十六名电气工人组成的突击队，经过十三天的苦战，架电线七公里，使这个管理区的七个自然屯从动力、照明、电话到有线广播全部实现了电气化。他们回来以后，又利用四天春节假期突击完成了外出十三天留下来的生产任务。当春节前夕这个管理区的电灯亮了的时候，农民个个欢欣鼓舞，整个农村几乎是彻夜不眠。农民对工人老大哥的支援满怀欣喜，他们说：千条线，万盏灯，最亲莫如工农弟兄！
    国营哈尔滨第一机器制造厂几年来一直注意加强和农村的互相支援、互相协作。工厂的党政领导干部经常下乡了解农村的需要，并且通过组织技术队伍、医疗队下乡，节日访问联欢和邀请农民来厂座谈等形式，不断加强工厂同农村的密切联系；特别是从1958年建立业余小工厂支援农业以后，工厂和农村人民公社更加紧密地连接在一起了。（附图片）
