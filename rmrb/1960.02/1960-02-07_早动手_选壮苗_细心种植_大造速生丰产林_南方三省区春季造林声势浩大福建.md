Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, February 6th: People's communes throughout Fujian Province are building fast-growing, high-yield forests on a large scale. In the past half-month, Xianyou County has dug over 280,000 mu of strip or terraced land for fast-growing, high-yield forests. In Minhou County, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee is taking the lead, organizing a group of commune members to go to the mountains and adopt measures such as "digging large pits, leveling terraces, selecting strong seedlings, and planting carefully," planning to build 120,000 mu of fast-growing, high-yield forests.

In recent years, Fujian has cultivated a number of fast-growing, high-yield forests of Chinese fir, eucalyptus, and oil-tea camellia. The four mu of Chinese fir forest cultivated by the Qianlan Brigade of the Longcun Commune in Jian'ou County were all mature in eight years. The largest Chinese fir had a diameter at breast height of 26.6 centimeters and a height of 13.5 meters; the average diameter at breast height of ordinary Chinese fir was also 19.5 centimeters, all reaching the standard for maturity, which is 12 to 15 years earlier than ordinary Chinese fir. More than 30 large-leaved eucalyptus trees cultivated by the Xiazhang Brigade of the Shajian Commune in Hua'an County have also all matured after three years of cultivation, which is 7 to 10 years earlier than the maturity time of ordinary eucalyptus trees. One mu and two li and six hao of fast-growing oil-tea camellia forest cultivated by the Tiandang Forest Farm of the Yangli Commune in Minhou County created the miracle of flowering in two years and bearing fruit in three years, which is four to five years earlier than ordinary oil-tea camellia forests yielding benefits.

The relevant departments in Fujian Province attach great importance to these experiences of fast-growing and high-yield, and have specially summarized them and widely promoted them throughout the province.

    Sichuan
    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, February 6th: Sichuan Province has started its spring afforestation early and on a large scale. In the past month, the province has afforested more than 6 million mu, completing more than 30% of the annual afforestation plan. After two large-scale tree planting campaigns in Wanxian Special District, the average person in the district has planted 500 trees of various types. A large number of saplings have been planted along both banks of the Yangtze River and along the two highways in the district. Forest farms have been established and various forest belts have been built on more than 4,000 large and small mountains and on both sides of a dozen main rivers. The Wanshou People's Commune in Yuechi County has joined three communes to establish a contiguous area of oil-tea camellia, bamboo, fruit trees, and timber forests on the 11,000-mu Longpan Mountain, according to the topography and soil properties. Yibin City and Yibin County have jointly established an approximately 100-li-long oil-tea camellia base.
    Guangxi
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, February 6th: People's communes in Guangxi have adopted a combination of short-term shock tactics and specialized management by forest farms, completing the annual afforestation task of 15 million mu by the end of January, exceeding the target by 300,000 mu. The newly planted trees in various places are of very good specifications and quality.

    The masses in various places are full of enthusiasm for afforestation. People in Guilin Special District carried out a shock afforestation of more than 280,000 mu in the four days from the first to the fourth day of the Lunar New Year. Liujiang County, where stone mountains are scattered everywhere, has relatively difficult afforestation work because of the many stone mountains, but the commune members split the stone crevices, found soil, and planted the saplings with one hoe and one dig. The masses in the sixty afforestation sections of the Damiaoshan Miao Autonomous County braved the cold of below zero degrees Celsius, wielding hoes to plant trees, adding new clothes to the barren mountains and wild ridges.

    早动手　选壮苗　细心种植　大造速生丰产林
    南方三省区春季造林声势浩大
    福建
    据新华社福州6日电　福建省各地人民公社大规模营造速生丰产林。仙游县半个月来已挖好带状或梯田速生丰产林地二十八万多亩。闽侯县由县委第一书记挂帅，组织一批社员上山采取“挖大穴、整梯田、选壮苗、细心种植”等措施，计划营造速生丰产林十二万亩。
    福建几年来已经培植出一批杉、桉、油茶等速生丰产林。建瓯县龙村公社前岚大队营造的四亩杉木林，八年全部成材，最大的杉木胸径达二十六点六厘米，树高十三点五米；一般杉木的平均胸径也有十九点五厘米，都达到成材标准，比一般杉木提早十二年到十五年成材。华安县沙建公社下樟大队营造的三十多株大叶桉树，经过三年的培育，也已全部成材，比一般桉树成材时间提早七年到十年。闽侯县洋里公社田垱林场营造的一亩二分六厘速生油茶林，创造了两年开花，三年结果的奇迹，比一般油茶林提早四、五年收益。
    福建省有关部门对这些速生丰产经验极为重视，专门作过总结并在全省各地广泛推广。
    四川
    据新华社成都6日电　四川各地春季造林动手早、声势大。一个月来，全省已造林六百多万亩，完成了全年造林计划的30％以上。万县专区经过两次大规模的植树造林运动后，全区平均每人已种植各种树木五百株。区内长江两岸和两条公路沿线都栽植了大量的树苗，并在四千多个大小山头上和十来条主要河道两侧建立了林场和营造了各种林带。岳池县万寿人民公社联合了三个公社在一万一千多亩的龙盘山上根据地形和土壤性质，建立了成片的油茶、竹子、果树和用材林。宜宾市和宜宾县联合建立了约一百华里长的油茶基地。
    广西
    据新华社南宁6日电　广西各地人民公社采取短期突击和林场专责管理相结合的办法，在1月底超额三十万亩完成了全年造林一千五百万亩的任务。各地新植的林木，规格质量很好。
    各地群众造林的干劲十足。桂林专区人民在大年初一到初四的四天中，突击造林二十八万多亩。石山四布的柳江县因为石山多，造林工作比较艰巨，但社员们劈开了石缝，找出泥土，一锄一挖的把树苗种上。大苗山苗族自治县六十个造林地段的群众，冒着摄氏零度以下的寒冷，挥锄造林，给荒山野岭添上了新装。
