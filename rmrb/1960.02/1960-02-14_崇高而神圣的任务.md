A Noble and Sacred Task
Bao Erhan

    As we, illuminated by the brilliant general line of the Party, are achieving a comprehensive leap forward in our national economy, and as the main targets of our Second Five-Year Plan are being victoriously completed three years ahead of schedule, we always remember that these victories are inseparable from the assistance of our great ally, the Soviet Union, and from the noble internationalist spirit of the Soviet people. Today, as we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, I am reminded of an unforgettable and extraordinary visit I once made. In 1958, to celebrate the 41st anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, I accompanied the Chinese Laboring People's Observation Delegation to the Soviet Union.
    During those twenty-odd days, we visited Moscow, Leningrad, Minsk, and Kiev, where we met with local Party and government officials, workers, farmers, students, and even children in kindergartens. Everywhere we went, we deeply felt the lofty and fraternal friendship shown by the Soviet people towards the people of our country. This was a symbol of the strong unity and close bond between the two great socialist countries, which deeply moved us.
    When we arrived at a kindergarten in a factory in Kiev, the children rushed out to greet us like a flock of little doves, holding onto us tightly. They said, "Please convey our best wishes to the children of China! Please pass on the drawings we made to them!" The children sang in unison: We warmly greet the children of China. Although mountains and rivers separate us, we will always be sisters and brothers. Please convey our greetings, greetings to the people's leader Mao Zedong, wishing him longevity, wishing him long life! The sincere wishes boiling out of the pure hearts of the children are a reflection of the inner feelings of the entire Soviet people, which will forever be remembered in the hearts of our six hundred and fifty million people. The vivid images of these lovely young flowers—the children—are forever before my eyes. Afterwards, I often thought: when they grow up, how many scholars and heroes will emerge among them! When they throw themselves into life and struggle, they will carry out selfless labor with a great spirit of internationalism! In twenty, thirty, or forty years, not only in our two countries, but throughout the world, who knows what great changes and inventions will take place! They will join hands with our Chinese children and other progressive people of white, yellow, black, and red skin, singing songs of liberation and freedom together, and working together to create miracles in nature and the universe! In their era, mankind will be forever free from oppression, exploitation, hunger, and the threat of war, and establish friendly, united, and mutually supportive relationships. This is the objective and inevitable law of social development. This law can never be changed by Eisenhower, Adenauer, Kishi Nobusuke, Franco, Chiang Kai-shek, and other reactionaries, nor do they have the power to change it. Of course, those ferocious enemies will carry out all kinds of rumors and sabotage, and may even provoke new wars of aggression, attempting to reverse the wheels of history; but they will only waste their efforts in vain, ending up being eliminated under the wheels of history. And the day of their demise will be the day when mankind achieves complete liberation. This is the death sentence written in the blood of the thousands upon thousands who sacrificed in their exploitation, oppression, wars, prisons, under the gallows, and in starvation. There is no other sentence!
    The fraternal friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is a powerful factor in safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world in today's world situation. The great Soviet Union's seven-year plan for communist construction and our Chinese Second Five-Year Plan and subsequent five-year plans, as well as the construction plans of other socialist brother countries, are all lighthouses guiding us towards a happy and bright life, and a powerful guarantee of world peace. It is precisely in the face of our solid friendship and great construction achievements that the imperialists and their accomplices are trembling, trying to carry out all kinds of sabotage. Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, said on April 17, 1957, when welcoming Comrade Voroshilov: "The great peoples of China and the Soviet Union are the closest brothers and the most reliable comrades-in-arms. In the noble cause of strengthening the unity of the socialist camp, safeguarding world peace, and promoting human progress, we Chinese people stand firmly with the Soviet people. The imperialist aggressor forces are always trying their best to provoke and undermine the unity and friendly relations between our two countries. But facts have proved that their conspiracies will never succeed at any time. No force in the world can separate us. The friendship of the eight hundred million people of China and the Soviet Union is eternal and unbreakable."
    What great, wise, and sincere maxims! These words are forever etched in the hearts of the six hundred and fifty million Chinese people. The Chinese people will cherish the friendship with the great Soviet people as they protect their own eyes. It will be a noble and sacred task for the six hundred and fifty million Chinese people!

    崇高而神圣的任务
    包尔汉
    当我们在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，取得我国国民经济的全面大跃进的胜利的时候，当我们的第二个五年计划的主要指标提前三年胜利完成的时候，我们总是要想到：这些胜利都是和伟大的盟邦苏联的帮助分不开的，都是和苏联人民的崇高的国际主义精神分不开的。今天在庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订十周年的时候，使我记起了我一次难忘的、不平凡的访问。1958年为了庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十一周年纪念，我曾经随中国劳动人民观礼团前往苏联。
    在二十几天中，我们参观访问了莫斯科、列宁格勒、明斯克和基辅等城市，在这些地方见到了当地党、政工作人员、工人、农民、学生以至幼儿园里的孩子们。我们每到一个地方，都深刻感受到苏联人民对我国人民所表现的崇高的、兄弟般的友谊。这是两个伟大的社会主义国家坚强团结、亲密无间的象征，我们对此深受感动。
    我们到了基辅一个工厂的幼儿园，孩子们像一群小鸽子一样飞奔出来迎接我们，抱住我们不放。他们说：“请您们捎好问候中国的儿童！请您们把我们画的图画转交给他们！”孩子们齐声合唱：我们热烈地问候中国的儿童，虽然高山大河隔离着我们，但我们永久是姐妹弟兄。请转达我们的问候，问候人民领袖毛泽东，祝他万岁，祝他长寿！从儿童们纯洁的心灵沸腾出来的真诚的愿望，也就是全体苏联人民内心情感的反映，它将永远记忆在我国六亿五千万人民的心里。这些可爱的年轻的花朵——儿童们生动的形象，永远浮现在我的面前。以后，我经常在想：他们将来长大成人的时候，其中将要出现多少学者和英雄人物！在他们投入生活和斗争的时候，他们将会以伟大的国际主义的精神进行着忘我的劳动！在二十、三十或四十年之后，不仅是我们两个国家，而是在整个世界上还不知将有怎样的伟大变革和发明创造！他们将和我们中国的儿女及其他白、黄、黑、红各种肤色的进步人民，共同携起手来同声歌唱解放和自由的歌曲，共同努力对自然和宇宙创造出奇迹来！在他们的时代，人类将永远摆脱压迫、剥削、饥寒和战争威胁，建立起相互间的友好、团结、互助的关系。这是社会发展的客观必然规律。这个规律是艾森豪威尔、阿登纳、岸信介、弗朗哥、蒋介石和其他反动分子们所永远不能改变的，他们也没有力量来改变。当然，那些凶恶的敌人，是会进行各种造谣破坏，甚至可能挑起新的侵略战争，妄图倒转历史车轮；但是他们永远只是枉费心机，自己落得在历史车轮下被消灭的下场。而他们灭亡的日子，也就是人类获得彻底解放的日子。这是在他们的剥削、压迫、战争、牢狱中、绞刑架下和饥寒交迫下牺牲的成千上万的人们所流的鲜血写成的判决书。除此而外，再没有别的判决！
    中苏两国人民兄弟般的友好合作，在今天的世界局势中是保卫远东和世界和平的强大因素。伟大苏联的共产主义七年建设计划和我们中国第二个五年计划和以后的五年计划以及其他社会主义兄弟国家的建设计划，都是引导我们走向幸福的光明生活的灯塔，也是世界和平的有力保证。帝国主义者和它们的帮凶们也正是在我们这种巩固的友谊和伟大的建设成就面前战栗，力图进行各种破坏的勾当。中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志1957年4月17日在欢迎伏罗希洛夫同志时说：“伟大的中苏两国人民是最亲密的兄弟和最可靠的战友。在加强社会主义阵营的团结，维护世界和平和促进人类进步的崇高事业中，我们中国人民同苏联人民是坚决地站在一起的。帝国主义侵略势力总是想尽一切办法挑拨和破坏我们两国之间的团结友好关系。但是事实证明，他们这些阴谋在任何时候都是不会得逞的。世界上没有任何力量能够把我们分开。中苏八亿人民的友谊是永恒的、牢不可破的。”
    这是如何伟大、英明和诚恳的格言！这些话永远记在六亿五千万中国人民的心里。中国人民将像保护自己的眼珠一样保护和伟大苏联人民之间的友谊。它将是六亿五千万中国人民崇高而神圣的任务！
