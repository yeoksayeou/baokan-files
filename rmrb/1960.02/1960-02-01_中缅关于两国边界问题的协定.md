Agreement Between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Union of Burma Regarding the Boundary Question Between the Two Countries

The Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Union of Burma, in order to promote a comprehensive settlement of the Sino-Burmese boundary question and to consolidate and further develop the friendly relations between China and Burma, agree to conclude this Agreement under the guidance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and have agreed upon the following articles:

Article 1

The Contracting Parties agree to immediately establish a joint committee composed of an equal number of representatives from both sides, and entrust the committee to discuss and resolve the specific issues concerning the Sino-Burmese boundary listed in Article 2 of this Agreement, to conduct boundary surveys and erect boundary markers, and to draft a Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. The Joint Committee shall hold meetings regularly in the capitals of China and Burma or in other locations in China and Burma.

Article 2

The Contracting Parties agree that the existing issues related to the Sino-Burmese boundary shall be resolved in accordance with the following provisions:

	I. The entire undefined boundary from Gawligaw Mountain to the western terminus of the Sino-Burmese boundary, with the exception of the Panhung, Kunglang, and Kangfang areas, shall be delimited in accordance with the traditional customary line; that is, from Gawligaw Mountain northward along the watershed that takes the Taiping River, Shweli River, Salween River, and Dulong River as one side and the N'Mai River as the other, until the point where it crosses the Dulong River between Jingdan and Mukaga, and then continues along the watershed that takes the Dulong River and the Tsayu River as one side and all the upper reaches of the Irrawaddy River system except the Dulong River as the other, until the western terminus of the Sino-Burmese boundary. The Joint Committee shall dispatch joint survey teams composed of an equal number of personnel from both sides to survey along the aforementioned watershed in order to determine the specific location of this section of the boundary line and to erect boundary markers.

	II. The Government of Burma agrees to return to China the Panhung, Kunglang, and Kangfang areas, which belong to China. As for the area of this region to be returned to China, the Joint Committee shall discuss and determine it based on the proposals put forward by the Government of Burma and the Government of China on February 4, 1957, and July 26, 1957, respectively, and marked on maps. After the Joint Committee has determined the area of this region to be returned to China, it shall dispatch joint survey teams composed of an equal number of personnel from both sides to conduct on-site surveys of the specific location of this section of the boundary line and to erect boundary markers.

	III. In order to abolish Burma's "perpetual lease" relationship over the Meng-Mao triangular area (i.e., the Namwan Assigned Tract), which belongs to China, at the confluence of the Namwan River and the Shweli River, the Government of China agrees to transfer this area to Burma, making it part of the territory of the Union of Burma. In exchange, the Government of Burma agrees to cede to China the jurisdiction of the Pan-Hung and Pan-Lao tribes west of the boundary line, defined by the Exchange of Notes between the Governments of China and the United Kingdom on June 18, 1941, from the confluence of the Nam-Ting and Nam-Pa Rivers to Boundary Pillar No. 1 of the already delimited southern section, making it part of Chinese territory. As for the area of these regions to be ceded to China, the Government of China and the Government of Burma put forward proposals marked on maps on July 26, 1957, and June 4, 1959, respectively. The areas where the proposals of the two governments are mutually consistent shall definitely be ceded to China. Regarding the areas where the proposals of the two governments differ with respect to the jurisdiction of the Pan-Hung tribe, the Joint Committee shall dispatch a group composed of an equal number of personnel from both sides to conduct on-site investigations to determine whether the area falls under the jurisdiction of the Pan-Hung tribe, in order to determine whether the area shall be transferred to China. After the area of the jurisdictions of the Pan-Hung and Pan-Lao tribes to be ceded to China has been determined in this way, the Joint Committee shall dispatch joint survey teams composed of an equal number of personnel from both sides to conduct on-site surveys of the specific location of this section of the boundary line and to erect boundary markers.

	IV. The section of the boundary from the confluence of the Nam-Ting and Nam-Pa Rivers to Boundary Pillar No. 1 of the already delimited southern section, with the exception of the adjustments stipulated in paragraph III of this Article, shall be delimited in accordance with the Exchange of Notes between the Governments of China and the United Kingdom on June 18, 1941. The Joint Committee shall dispatch joint survey teams composed of an equal number of personnel from both sides to delimit, demarcate, and erect boundary markers along this section of the boundary line.

Article 3

The Contracting Parties agree that after the Joint Committee has resolved the existing issues related to the Sino-Burmese boundary listed in Article 2 of this Agreement, it shall be responsible for drafting the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, which shall include not only the sections of the boundary mentioned in Article 2 of this Agreement, but also the sections of the boundary that have been delimited in the past and do not need to be altered. The new Boundary Treaty, after being signed and entered into force by the two governments, shall replace all old treaties and exchanges of notes concerning the boundary between the two countries. In accordance with its consistent policy of opposing foreign privileges and respecting the sovereignty of other countries, the Government of China declares that it renounces the right to participate in the operation of the Lufang mining enterprises in Burma as stipulated in the Exchange of Notes between the Governments of China and the United Kingdom on June 18, 1941.

Article 4

	(1) This Agreement shall be subject to ratification, and the instruments of ratification shall be exchanged in Rangoon as soon as possible.

	(2) This Agreement shall enter into force immediately upon the exchange of instruments of ratification and shall automatically expire when the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty to be signed by the two governments enters into force. Done at Beijing on January 28, 1960, in duplicate, each in the Chinese and English languages, both texts being equally authentic.

    中缅关于两国边界问题的协定
    新华社31日讯　中华人民共和国政府和缅甸联邦政府关于两国边界问题的协定
    中华人民共和国政府和缅甸联邦政府，为了促进中缅边界问题的全面解决，为了巩固和进一步发展中缅两国的友好关系，同意在和平共处五项原则的指导下，缔结本协定，并且议定下列各条：
    第一条
    缔约双方同意立即成立由双方同等人数的代表所组成的联合委员会，并且责成该委员会根据本协定的规定，商谈解决本协定第二条所列的有关中缅边界的各项具体问题，进行勘察边界和树立界桩的工作，起草中缅边界条约。联合委员会定期地在中缅两国的首都或者中缅两国的其他地点举行会议。
    第二条
    缔约双方同意，有关中缅边界的现存问题按照下列的规定解决：
    一、自尖高山起到中缅边界西端终点的全部未定界，除片马、古浪、岗房地区以外，遵照传统的习惯线定界，也就是说，从尖高山起沿着以太平江、瑞丽江、怒江、独龙江为一方和恩梅开江为另一方的分水岭向北，直到在靖丹和木刻戛之间跨越独龙江的地方，然后继续沿着以独龙江和察隅河为一方和除独龙江以外的全部伊洛瓦底江上游支系为另一方的分水岭，直到中缅边界西端的终点为止。联合委员会将派出由双方同等人数的人员组成的联合勘察队，沿着上述分水岭进行勘察，以确定这一段边界线的具体位置，并且树立界桩。
    二、缅甸政府同意将属于中国的片马、古浪、岗房地区归还中国。至于归还给中国的这个地区的面积，由联合委员会根据缅甸政府和中国政府分别在一九五七年二月四日和一九五七年七月二十六日提出的并且用地图标明的建议，商谈确定。联合委员会在确定归还给中国的这个地区的面积以后，将派出由双方同等人数的人员组成的联合勘察队，实地勘察这一段边界线的具体位置，并且树立界桩。
    三、为了废除缅甸对南碗河和瑞丽江汇合处的、属于中国的猛卯三角地区（即南碗指定区）所保持的“永租”关系，中国政府同意把这个地区移交给缅甸，成为缅甸联邦领土的一部分。作为交换，缅甸政府同意，把班洪部落和班老部落在一九四一年六月十八日中英两国政府换文划定的、从南定河和南帕河汇合处到南段已定界第一号界桩为止的边界线以西的辖区划归中国，成为中国领土的一部分。至于划归中国的这些地区的面积，中国政府和缅甸政府分别在一九五七年七月二十六日和一九五九年六月四日提出了用地图标明的建议。两国政府的建议中互相一致的地区，肯定划归中国。两国政府的建议中关于班洪部落的辖区有出入的地区，由联合委员会派出双方同等人数的人员组成的小组实地查明该地区是否属于班洪部落管辖，以便确定该地区是否移交中国。划归中国的班洪部落和班老部落辖区的面积这样确定以后，联合委员会将派出由双方同等人数的人员组成的联合勘察队，实地勘察这一段边界线的具体位置，并且树立界桩。
    四、从南定河和南帕河汇合处到南段已定界第一号界桩为止的一段边界，除本条第三款所规定的调整以外，按照一九四一年六月十八日中英两国政府的换文定界。联合委员会将派出由双方同等人数的人员组成的联合勘察队，沿着这一段边界线进行定界、标界和树立界桩的工作。
    第三条
    缔约双方同意，联合委员会在解决本协定第二条中所列的有关中缅边界的现存问题以后，将负责起草中缅边界条约，其中不仅将包括本协定第二条所提到的各段边界，而且将包括过去已经划定、无需加以更改的各段边界。新的边界条约经两国政府签订和生效后，将代替一切旧的有关两国边界的条约和换文。中国政府根据一贯反对外国特权和尊重其他国家主权的政策，声明放弃一九四一年六月十八日中英两国政府换文所规定的、中国参加经营缅甸炉房矿产企业的权利。
    第四条
    （一）本协定须经批准，批准书应尽速在仰光交换。
    （二）本协定在互换批准书以后立即生效，到两国政府将签订的中缅边界条约生效时自动失效。一九六○年一月二十八日订于北京，共两分，每分都用中文和英文写成，中、英两种文本具有同等效力。
