Spring is warm, flowers bloom, and everything looks new,
A great leap forward in accumulating and making fertilizer,
The war drums boom and shake the clouds,
Songs move people for ten miles.
A cart of fertilizer, a cart of grain,
A pit of good manure, a pit of gold,
Spring fertilizer piles are higher than mountains,
Summer wheat stacks connect with the colorful clouds.

    一坑好粪一坑金
    春暖花开气象新，
    积肥造肥大进军，
    战鼓咚咚震云霄，
    歌声十里动人心。
    一车肥料一车粮，
    一坑好粪一坑金，
    春季肥堆高过山，
    夏季麦垛接彩云。
