Actively Promote the Increase of Labor Productivity

Since November of last year, Shanxi Daily has conducted continuous reports on the technical innovation and technical revolution movement on the industrial production, transportation, and capital construction fronts of the province, focusing on the issue of improving labor productivity. The newspaper has successively published ten editorials specifically discussing this issue and has conducted extensive and in-depth reports from various aspects. This has played a vital role in inspiring the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and promoting the in-depth development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, as well as achieving a better and more comprehensive leap forward.

Shanxi Daily's report was carried out in response to the questions of how to improve labor productivity and continue the leap forward, and how to reform technology and solve the problem of labor shortage. Throughout the report, the struggle between two lines and two methods was implemented. This meant resolutely opposing conservative ideas such as "increased production must increase manpower" and "more people make things easier," as well as the idea that how much can be done depends on how many people there are. It advocated using revolutionary methods of tapping the potential of enterprises, improving labor efficiency, and increasing production without increasing manpower to solve the labor shortage problem. It also meant resolutely opposing the erroneous idea and method of regarding technical innovation and technical revolution as purely technical work, and therefore only a small number of people could engage in it in a cold and slow manner. It advocated that technical revolution must be politically led, a mass movement must be vigorously launched, and the revolutionary thought and method of high speed must be realized.

In an editorial published on November 23, entitled "Greatly Increase Labor Productivity," the situation of Shanxi Province's continued leap forward was clearly discussed. It pointed out that one of the basic measures for the high-speed development of industry is to carefully tap the labor potential within enterprises and strive to improve labor productivity. It also used a large number of facts to refute conservative ideas such as "increased production must increase manpower" and "more people make things easier," explaining that there is great potential within enterprises. As long as the masses are mobilized to carry out a technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, and corresponding improvements are made in production organization and labor organization, labor productivity can be greatly improved, and a large number of laborers can be saved. In the second editorial published on December 6, "Realize Mechanization at High Speed," according to the development of the movement and the existing problems, the method of carrying out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement was put forward in a timely manner, criticizing the cold and slow phenomena existing in the movement, and pointing out that to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, it must be done vigorously, quickly, carefully, and collaboratively. In the subsequent editorials and other forms of commentary, the struggle between two roads and two methods was also implemented. This strengthened the ideological and combative nature of the newspaper's propaganda, closely integrated the newspaper with the actual movement, and specifically implemented the Party's general line of socialist construction, as well as the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, into the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, becoming a driving force for promoting the movement.

In the report on improving labor productivity, Shanxi Daily also adopted the method of widely establishing pacesetters and planting red flags everywhere. At the beginning, the newspaper seized on the typical example of Taiyuan Cement Plant vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, reducing staff by 29.35%, but the labor productivity and total output value steadily increased month by month and quarter by quarter, and made prominent publicity. From November 23 to January 13, in fifty days, the newspaper published advanced examples and advanced experiences of thirty units. These advanced experiences involved a wide range of areas, including heavy industry and light industry; large enterprises and small enterprises; construction companies and transportation and postal and telecommunications industries. In this way, the newspaper not only provided typical experiences needed for each step forward in the movement according to the development of the movement, but also established pacesetters for all walks of life. For example, the degree of mechanization of the province's local industry (county-run industry) was very low, and it occupied a lot of labor. The newspaper seized on the typical example of Houma City using the method of large-scale collaboration to mobilize all the workers in the city to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movement, reducing workers by 60% and increasing labor productivity by 4.3 times, and published editorials, news, and experience introduction articles, setting an example for the province's local industry. The labor efficiency of local small coal kilns was low, and they occupied a lot of manpower. The newspaper prominently publicized the advanced deeds and experience of the Xinsheng Coal Mine in Yicheng County in realizing semi-mechanization, reducing staff by one-third, and increasing coal production by three times. Pacesetters were also established and advanced experiences were publicized in construction, transportation, coal loading and unloading, mining, crushing, handling, and forging and casting in the machinery manufacturing industry.

In the report on vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, Shanxi Daily paid attention to closely combining it with the production and construction work of each period. Through a series of commentaries, the newspaper not only criticized the erroneous ideas of some people who did not pay attention to carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, fearing that carrying out this movement would affect production and construction, but also criticized the erroneous ideas of some people who separated technical innovation and technical revolution from production and construction work, and carried out innovation for the sake of innovation. In order to combine technical innovation and technical revolution with production and construction in each period, the newspaper also took the initiative to raise topics and select typical examples. For example, when enterprises discussed and formulated the leap forward plan for 1960 in mid-December last year, the newspaper selected the example of the Taiyuan Boiler Factory for publicity. This factory mobilized the masses to calculate labor accounts, and through accounting, they tapped labor potential, formulated a production plan and a technical innovation and technical revolution plan, and planned to innovate 189 projects this year, reducing staff by 10% and increasing output by 50%. The newspaper made prominent reports on this and wrote an editorial entitled "Two Methods of Accounting."

Shanxi Daily attached great importance to new things in the report on improving labor productivity. The newspaper conducted serious research on the new forms of competition created by the broad masses in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the new competition slogans and practices put forward, and vigorously promoted them on this basis. For example, Yangquan City carried out a mass movement of "learning from the advanced and striving for the upstream" in technical innovation and technical revolution. The broad masses of workers compared themselves with the most advanced units in the country, the province, and the special zone in terms of technical and economic indicators, discovered the most advanced units, found the reasons, formulated technical measures, and strived to catch up within a time limit. This not only made the goals of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement clearer and the content more substantial, but also greatly increased the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers. After discovering this typical example, the newspaper immediately organized the responsible comrades of Yangquan City to write articles to introduce their experience and published an editorial entitled "Comparing with the Advanced and Striving for the Upstream," which promoted the rapid popularization of this new practice throughout the province. Taiyuan City created a new form of martial arts competition and practice in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and the newspaper also reported it in a timely manner and published an editorial. Shanxi Daily did a more outstanding job in summarizing and promoting advanced experience in the technical skill competitions held in various industries in the province. For example, coal miners developed the performance competition into a technical operation competition in the technical performance competition; construction workers used the forms of temple fairs and treasure offering conferences to select, finalize, and match all new tools in the technical skill competition, so that construction machinery could be equipped into a "dragon." The newspaper seized the new experience provided by these two meetings, wrote editorials to elaborate on them in detail, and raised the significance of these two new experiences to a theoretical height. This will help to push the technical innovation and technical revolution movement of the province to a new stage.

    积极促进劳动生产率的提高
    从去年11月份以来，山西日报围绕着提高劳动生产率的问题，对全省工业生产、交通运输和基本建设战线上的技术革新和技术革命运动，进行了连续报道。报纸先后发表了十篇专门论述这一问题的社论，并从各个方面作了广泛深入的报道。这对鼓舞广大职工群众的革命干劲，推动技术革新和技术革命运动的深入发展，实现更好更全面的跃进，有十分重要的作用。
    山西日报的这一报道，是针对着如何提高劳动生产率，继续跃进，和如何改革技术，解决劳动力不足的问题进行的。在报道中，自始至终地贯彻了两条路线、两种方法的斗争，这就是坚决地反对“增产必增人”“人多好办事”，以及有多少人才能办多少事等保守思想，提倡用挖掘企业潜力、提高劳动效率、增产不增人的革命办法解决劳动力不足的问题；坚决反对把技术革新和技术革命看成是纯技术性的工作，因而只能由少数人冷冷清清、慢慢吞吞去搞的错误思想和错误方法，提倡技术革命必须政治挂帅，必须大搞群众运动，必须实现高速度的革命思想和方法。
    在11月23日发表的一篇论述“大大提高劳动生产率”的社论中，明确地论述了山西省继续跃进的形势，指出高速度发展工业的基本措施之一，是认真地挖掘企业内部的劳动潜力，努力提高劳动生产率；并且用大量的事实反驳了“增产必增人”“人多好办事”等保守思想，说明企业内部存在着很大的潜力，只要发动群众开展以机械化半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，并且相应地改进生产组织和劳动组织，就可以使劳动生产率大大提高，节省出大批劳动力。在12月6日发表的第二篇社论“高速度实现机械化”中，根据运动发展的状况和存在的问题，又及时地提出开展技术革新和技术革命运动的方法问题，批判了运动中存在的冷冷清清、慢慢吞吞的现象，指出了开展技术革新和技术革命，必须大搞、快搞、细搞、协作搞。在随后发表的若干篇社论和其他形式的评论中，也都贯彻了两条道路和两种方法的斗争。这就使报纸宣传的思想性、战斗性加强，使报纸与实际运动紧密地结合起来，把党的社会主义建设总路线，以及八届八中全会的决议精神，具体地贯彻到技术革新和技术革命运动中，成为推动运动的动力。
    山西日报在提高劳动生产率的报道中，还采取了广树标兵、遍插红旗的方法。一开始，报纸就抓住太原水泥厂大搞技术革新技术革命，使人员减少了29．35％，但劳动生产率和总产值却逐月逐季稳步上升的典型事例，作了突出的宣传。从11月23日至1月13日的五十天中，报纸共发表了三十个单位的先进事例和先进经验。这些先进经验涉及的面很广，有重工业，有轻工业；有大企业，有小企业；有建筑施工企业，也有交通运输、邮电等行业。这样，报纸不仅根据运动发展的情况，提供了运动每前进一步所需要的典型经验，而且为各行各业都树立了标兵。如全省的地方工业（县营工业）机械化程度很低，占用劳力多，报纸就抓住候马市用大协作的办法发动全市职工开展技术革新和技术革命运动，使工人减少60％，劳动生产率提高四点三倍的典型事例，发表社论、新闻和经验介绍的文章，为全省地方工业树立了榜样。地方小煤窑的劳动效率低，占用人工多，报纸就突出地宣传了翼城县新胜煤矿实现半机械化，人员减少三分之一，产煤量提高三倍的先进事迹和经验。在建筑施工、交通运输、煤矿装卸、采矿、粉碎、搬运和机械制造业的锻铸等方面，也都分别树立了标兵，宣传了先进经验。
    在大搞技术革新和技术革命的报道中，山西日报注意了与各个时期的生产和建设工作紧密结合。报纸通过一系列的评论，既批判了一些人不重视开展技术革新和技术革命，怕开展这一运动会影响生产和建设的错误思想，又批判了一些人把技术革新和技术革命与生产建设工作分割开，为革新而革新的错误思想。如使技术革新和技术革命与各个时期的生产建设相结合，报纸还主动地出课题，选典型。如在去年12月中旬各企业讨论和制订1960年的跃进计划时，报纸就选择了太原锅炉厂的事例进行宣传。这个厂发动群众算劳力账，通过算账挖掘了劳动潜力，制订了生产计划和技术革新和技术革命计划，要在今年革新一百八十九个项目，使人员减少10％，产量增长50％。报纸对此作了突出的报道，并写了“两种算账方法”的社论。
    山西日报在提高劳动生产率的报道中十分重视新鲜事物，报纸对广大群众在技术革新和技术革命运动中创造的新的竞赛形式，提出的新的竞赛口号和作法，都进行了认真的研究，并在这个基础上大力推广。如阳泉市在技术革新和技术革命方面开展了“学先进，争上游”的群众运动，广大职工都在技术经济指标上与全国、全省和全专区最先进的单位比，发现最先进的单位，就寻找原因，制订技术措施，限期赶上，这样不仅使技术革新和技术革命运动的目标更加明确，内容更加充实，而且使职工们的革命干劲大增。报纸发现这一典型后，立即组织阳泉市的负责同志写文章介绍经验。并发表了题为“比先进，争上游”的社论，促使这一新的作法很快普及全省。太原市在技术革新和技术革命运动中，创造了比武练武的新形式，报纸也及时地作了报道，发表了社论。在全省各行业举行的技术比武赛中，山西日报在总结和推广先进经验方面做得更加突出。如煤矿工人在技术表演赛中，把表演赛发展成为技术操作比武赛；建筑业职工在技术比武赛中，用庙会、献宝会的形式对所有的新工具进行选型、定型和配套、使施工机械配成“一条龙”。报纸抓住这两次会议所提供出来的新经验，写社论加以详细论述，把这两种新经验的意义提高到理论的高度。这样就有助于把全省的技术革新和技术革命运动推向一个新的阶段。
