Karamay!
Karamay, Karamay, Karamay! This name has inspired so many people. It looks beautiful, sounds sonorous, and is pleasing to the ear! To say it's beautiful like a flower, only our socialist fertile land can cultivate such a beautiful flower! To say it's as handsome as a young woman, only the brilliance of the Party's General Line can nurture such a handsome young woman.

Karamay is a transliteration from the Uyghur language of our fraternal nationalities. "Kara" means black, and "May" means oil. However, since the name became known, people have used it as a place name.

        Originally the Home of the Gazelle
Twenty years ago, there was a story like this.

In the Gobi Desert in the northwestern part of the Junggar Basin, a herd of gazelles as nimble as deer were running, followed by a Uyghur hunter named Saylong Bayi. He didn't race with the gazelles, as he knew their habits: they would run for a while and then look back, and if they didn't see any movement, they would pick leaves from the camel thorns to eat. Saylong Bayi crawled forward like a soldier advancing on a battlefield, step by step, until he was within rifle range, and finally shot two of them! Saylong Bayi tied up the gazelles and lay down on the Gobi Desert to rest. Suddenly, a strange smell wafted in the breeze. He looked up and saw that the small hill next to him was indigo in color. He stepped on the blue soil and climbed to the top of the hill, where he found a black spring, with sticky black water bubbling and swirling. Saylong Bayi tore off a piece of paper from his roll of tobacco, dipped it in the black water, and lit it with a fire: "Whoosh!" it ignited! From then on, every year during the "dry season" of hunting, Saylong Bayi would bring his furniture, look for this place by looking towards the Genghis Khan Mountains, scoop up some black oil, and sell it to people for greasing cart axles, lighting, and heating.

After liberation, Saylong Bayi also received cattle, sheep, and land.

A few years ago, by chance, Father Saylong Bayi passed by here. He suddenly saw derricks and heard the sound of machines. He ran over in one breath, and saw groups of trucks transporting crude oil, and touched the derricks and steel pipes. The old man's eyes welled up with tears. He excitedly shook hands with the oil workers and said, "Only the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can turn the Gobi Desert into paradise!"

        The Road is Forged by Walking
Twenty years ago, Father Saylong Bayi had been here hunting gazelles; after liberation, under the leadership of the Party, Soviet experts and Chinese geological and exploration technicians braved the cold winds blowing down from the Altai Mountains, repeatedly leaving their footprints in front of the small Black Oil Mountain.

Did the small Black Oil Mountain area have oil or not? Soviet geological experts and Chinese geological workers spent countless days and nights, researching, analyzing, and discussing, concluding that there was oil underground. The Party decided to march on the small Black Oil Mountain!

In the summer of 1955, the Dushanzi Mining Bureau Party Committee sent the Wu Shou'er installation team on an "expedition." Wu Shou'er, the Uyghur team leader, led his entire team and took the first road on the Gobi Desert, arriving in front of the Genghis Khan Mountains, next to the small Black Oil Mountain, where they erected the first derrick.

The Party then selected thirty-five young men to form a youth drilling team, asking them to go on a "lone army expedition!"

These thirty-five young men included eight nationalities and came from many provinces – from Guangdong to the Northeast. Few people in the team had attended middle school. Even the team leader, Lu Mingbao, had only graduated from Shanghai Zhonghua Vocational School in 1952 and learned from Soviet technicians on the Dushanzi drilling platform for three years.

The young men were both happy and apprehensive when they received the mission, but they also had beautiful and innocent thoughts.

"Go wherever it's difficult!"

"It won't be a 'lone army expedition'!"

The young people set off with brave and pure hearts. They found the derrick installed by the Wu Shou'er team.

How unique! A derrick stood on the vast Gobi Desert. Looking as far as the eye could see, to the endless horizon, it was still the Gobi Desert!

"Set up camp"! Ning Yuanxing, Xie Dalou, Asha, Li Shishun, Shadu, and others were busy: leveling the ground, setting up tents, chopping firewood, and starting the stove. Jing Yitian thought even faster: he didn't even open his luggage, and summoned several people to go with the driver to the Manas River, hundreds of miles away, to fetch drilling water and drinking water.

On July 6, the diesel engine started! The drilling rig rotated! The traveling block worked!

This vast Gobi Desert, which had been lonely for countless centuries, now began to play "boom boom rumble! clink clank!" What beautiful music! The young men listened, feeling the significance of their work, and a joyful and proud mood sparkled in their eyes.

But, this was after all an uninhabited Gobi Desert! The sun was so scorching it cracked the rocks, and a single cloud could turn into a downpour. One night a storm blew, and the next day their clothes, basins, and mugs were nowhere to be found. Even more cursing was the fact that wild mosquitoes, wild flies, horseflies, and other insects "attacked" them day and night!

Working and living conditions were harsh. However, during these difficult days, the Party frequently sent letters asking what difficulties they had and what help they needed? Furthermore, leading comrades were repeatedly sent to visit them. The young men felt the warmth of the Party, and their will became even more determined, so they put forward a loud slogan:

"Settle down, take root, and never give up until we strike oil!"

After more than a hundred days and nights of fighting, on the afternoon of October 29, the whole team knew that the time had come to "reveal" what this exploratory well would yield. Failure? Success? It hung in everyone's heart. Therefore, people who were off work didn't leave, and people who weren't supposed to be on duty ran over to surround the drilling platform, some guarding the blowout preventer, others lying on the mud pool looking for oil slicks and smelling for oil fumes.

Oil gushed out! The black oil, buried underground for billions of years, had seen the light of day! What beautiful color! Black with a blue sheen, blue with a shimmering light.

What could make oil workers more joyful than striking oil in an "expedition" to drill an exploratory well? Jumping, singing, hugging, and even like "Water Splashing Festival," dipping crude oil and smearing it on each other's faces and bodies… the revelry continued until late at night.

          Where is Home
God creating the world is a myth, but our labor creating the world is reality. The development of Karamay is simply like a myth, from opening the first well to now, only a little over four years have passed, and now, on this Gobi Desert, a city with a population of tens of thousands has been established. It is truly "from nothing to something," and "something" so quickly!

Four years ago, only one Doctor Yan came here, and he often carried his medicine bag to "practice medicine"; when workers came to see him for treatment, there were three beds in the dugout, two of which were used by personnel from two other units for office work and sleeping, while Doctor Yan's bed was used for diagnosis, prescription, and as a sickbed. Now, the hospital building on Junggar Road, with three floors, has nine departments and more than 300 beds.

The Xinhua Bookstore was initially housed in Little Zhu's sack, setting up mobile book stalls in front of the canteen door and the derrick. Now, the main store and branch stores sold more than 500,000 books last year alone.

Initially, Little Ma's shoulder bag contained the post and telecommunications office. Delivering letters meant listening to accents, looking at faces, and asking questions; receiving letters meant selling stamps, envelopes, and stationery, and even sealing envelopes and sticking stamps on them, and even writing letters for people. Now, the number of postal and telecommunications personnel has increased to over 100 and they are still overwhelmed. According to Director Gu, who was transferred from Shanghai three and a half years ago, a post and telecommunications building will be built this year, with 4,000 automatic telephones installed, and a fax machine will also be installed.

The main stores and branch stores of various shops are located on various streets in the city; at intersections, people's police direct passing vehicles and pedestrians; the Sino-Soviet Friendship Hall on Tianshan Road is constantly busy with workers coming and going day and night; cinemas, men's and women's bathhouses, barbershops, ethnic restaurants, etc., are all as thriving as those in big cities. In a word: with only four and a half years of "creation from scratch" history, this kind of miracle can only be realized in our socialist country.

      Inspiring Large Oilfield
Karamay's exploratory wells are like tentacles on the oil front, expanding rapidly in all directions. The workers drilling exploratory wells report good news to the Party committee almost every time they drill a well! The derricks of Karamay's production wells gradually become forests and rows on this lively Gobi Desert.

After completing their drilling tasks, the derricks are progressing forward one by one – the workers created "overall relocation," using a dozen tractors to pull the dozens of meters high "steel towers" as a whole, truly deserving the name "Great General with eight faces of majesty!"

After each well is drilled, a "Christmas tree" is installed. As many wells as are drilled, as many Christmas trees are installed. The oil pipelines connected from the Christmas trees, like spider webs, are densely distributed under the Gobi Desert. Oil metering stations are being established one by one. The oil workers are taming the underground sea of oil, allowing it to gush out from the depths of the earth in a planned manner, day and night. Then, this black liquid gold is pressurized and sent to the places that need it.

Karamay, in this way, started from the first well, and now, batches of oil wells have been drilled.

Are there any failures among these wells? Qin Feng, who has been the director of the Karamay Mining Bureau, said humorously: "Almost all the wells drilled here gush oil. There are also very few wells that, after drilling for a long time, release a fart. But it doesn't matter! When the chemical industry catches up, one well of fart (methane) is also a well of treasure! Only a dry hole is considered a failure. But this kind of well is one in a hundred."

What is the size of the reserves in the Karamay Oilfield? Even now, they are still exploring its edges!

      Deeds of Heroes
After last year's National Day, five heroes from Karamay – Hu Baoshan, Zhang Yunqing, Ka Yixia, Sun Yuting, and Zhao Renjie – represented all the mine's employees in Beijing to attend the National Congress of Heroes. When I heard the heroic deeds created by the heroes, I shouted from the bottom of my heart:

Long live the General Line! Long live the Great Leap Forward!

Drilling captain Zhang Yunqing, the son of a poor peasant, only learned a little culture in the army. After being demobilized, he saw the mud used for drilling for the first time in Yumen in 1954, and was transferred to Karamay three years ago.

In the spring of 1958, the General Line illuminated Zhang Yunqing's eyes, and the Great Leap Forward liberated his thinking. Zhang Yunqing raised a question to the whole team: drilling has footage, but can we only drill around 500 meters a month? Can't we leap forward? Let's come up with an idea to drill 1,000 meters in a month and 10,000 meters in a year!

"Over a thousand a month, over ten thousand a year!" As soon as Zhang Yunqing proposed it, it was immediately opposed by conservative thinking. Yes, drilling is a hard-on-hard matter, using steel drill bits to drill on rocks. Moreover, at that time, no one in the country had heard of anyone being able to drill a thousand meters in a month. Therefore, the conservative "scholars" satirized it as "wishful thinking"; as for the technological innovations proposed by Zhang Yunqing's team, they said it was "walking a tightrope, cars don't need brakes."

Zhang Yunqing was not poured cold water on, he heard the Party's voice:

"Do it, the Party supports you!"

Proposed in early March, achieved by the end of March.

Many people rejoiced for the victory of the first "over a thousand a month" in the country, but the conservatives were unwilling to harm his personal self-esteem, so they said "this is accidental."

Zhang Yunqing ignored this kind of obstruction, he was focused on the interests of the people and the friendship competition with his old friend Wang Jinxi's drilling team in Yumen.

In the seven months from April to November, not only did they exceed a thousand meters every month, but they gradually exceeded two thousand, three thousand, four thousand meters per month, reaching a leap of four thousand three hundred and one meters drilled in a month!

It's really "rare and valuable"! Because the workers dared to think, dared to speak, and dared to act, they created incalculable wealth for the country!

"Learn from Zhang Yunqing, catch up with Zhang Yunqing, surpass Zhang Yunqing!" This movement was launched in Karamay, and in 1958, 240 teams in the whole mine reached over a thousand meters per month. Demobilized soldier and drilling captain Sun Yuting, this young man from Fuxin, Liaoning, was even more aggressive, and in 1959, their drilling team actually drilled 20,000 meters!

      Salute to the Oil Workers
At dusk, when thousands of households light up their lamps, when people travel by car or plane or ship, when diesel engines are started to drive machine production and tractors are used to cultivate land, people will think of oil. Because gasoline, kerosene, diesel, asphalt, etc. are all refined from oil.

However, when I came to Karamay and saw the drilling workers and the oil production workers – they and their bodies, hands, and even faces, were covered in oil stains and mud spots. How beautiful! What color could be more beautiful than carrying the marks of a body in labor? I smelled a burst of petroleum scent from them, and I really wanted to run up and hug them.

Male and female oil workers are fighting day and night on the Gobi Desert. In the scorching sun, in the wind and rain, they drill and extract non-stop. The Gobi Desert is covered with snow, and in recent days it has often been more than minus forty degrees. The cold wind from the Altai Mountains often strikes, and in this kind of freezing Gobi Desert, the respectable oil workers do not retreat, do not fear, and still drill and extract non-stop! Because, the oil workers deeply understand: industrial and agricultural production needs oil, national defense needs oil, and people's lives need oil!

Recently, when the news that the train had arrived in Hami came, the oil workers' enthusiasm was even more fiery. Everyone put forward greater leap forward targets, guaranteeing a good start, a red month, and a red end, in order to welcome the train's arrival in Karamay in the near future! The workers said well:

"In the past, only a few hundred trucks came to transport our crude oil. The train will soon be arriving in Karamay. When that time comes, we must make sure it is full of cars every day!"

What heroic spirit!

Ah! Karamay! A little over four years ago, you were still a desolate Gobi Desert, and now, you are already a city with tens of thousands of people. Around you, tens of thousands of male and female heroes are fighting against nature every day and night, they are taking treasures from the depths of the earth, and they are going to transport them to all parts of the country. How can this not make me sing to you, pay tribute to you:

You, the lovely oil city of Karamay!

You, the respectable heroic city of Karamay!

    克拉玛依颂
    牧野
    克拉玛依这个名字
    克拉玛依，克拉玛依，克拉玛依！这个振奋过多少人心的名字，看起来漂亮，叫起来响亮，听起来又美丽！说它美丽像朵花，只有我们社会主义的肥沃土地，才能培育出这么美的花！说它俊得像个少女，只有党的总路线的光辉照耀，才会成长这样俊的少女。
    克拉玛依，是兄弟民族维吾尔语的译音。克拉是黑，玛依是油。不过，自从叫响这个名字，人们都拿它当作地名来呼唤的。
        原是黄羊故乡
    二十年前，有个这样的故事。
    在准噶尔盆地西北部的戈壁滩上，飞奔着一群山鹿一样的黄羊，后面跟着一个维吾尔族的猎手赛龙巴依。他并不和黄羊赛跑，他懂得黄羊的脾气：跑一阵要回头看看，不见动静，就在骆驼刺上选择叶子吃。赛龙巴依像阵地上匍匐前进的战士，一步步爬到猎枪射程以内，终于一枪打中了两只！赛龙巴依捆起黄羊，就躺在戈壁滩上休息。忽然，微风吹来一股子奇怪气味，他抬头看看，身旁的小土山是蓝靛颜色。他踏着蓝土登上山顶，发现山顶上有一口黑泉，粘糊糊的黑水，向上冒着泡沫、翻黑花。赛龙巴依掏出卷莫合烟的纸撕下一片，蘸了些黑水，划火一点：“呼”地着了！从此，赛龙巴依每年在行猎“旱季”时候，他就带着家具，望着成吉思汗山寻找到这里，舀些黑油，卖给人家膏马车轴、照亮、取暖。
    解放后，赛龙巴依也分得了牛羊和田。
    是前几年一个偶然机会，赛龙巴依老爷子打这里路过，他突然望见井架，又听到机器声响，老爷子一口气跑来，看看成群的汽车装运的原油，摸摸井架和钢管，老爷子的眼睛湿润了，他激动地握住石油工人们的手说：“只有共产党、毛主席，才能把戈壁滩变成天堂！”
        路是走出来的
    二十年前，赛龙巴依老爷子打黄羊来过此地；解放后，在党的领导下，苏联专家们和中国的地质、勘探技术工作人员们，曾经冒着阿尔泰山吹下来的寒风，来来回回地把脚印留在小黑油山前。
    小黑油山一带究竟有油还是没油？苏联地质专家们和中国地质工作者经过了多少个日日夜夜，研究、分析、讨论，认定地下有油。党决定向小黑油山进军！
    1955年夏天，独山子矿务局党委派乌受尔安装队“远征”。这个维吾尔族乌受尔队长，率领起他全队人员，从戈壁滩上踏下了第一条道路，来到成吉思汗山前，小黑油山旁，矗立起第一座井架。
    党又选拔了三十五个小伙子，组成一支青年钻井队，要他们“孤军远征”！
    这三十五个小伙子，包括八个民族和很多省份——从广东到东北，全队里很少人念过中学，就连队长陆铭宝，1952年才刚走出上海中华职业学校，到独山子井台上跟苏联技师们学习三年。
    小伙子们接到任务，虽说又喜又惧，但是想的又美又天真。
    “哪艰苦就到哪里去！”
    “不会是‘孤军远征’”的！
    青年们带着勇敢而又纯洁的心出发了。他们找到了乌受尔队安装的井架。
    多别致！辽阔的戈壁滩上，一座井架矗立着。极目远望，望到天边无际处，还是戈壁滩！
    “安营下寨”！宁元兴、谢达楼、阿沙、李世顺、沙都等等忙成一团：平地后，搭帐篷、砍柴禾、起锅灶。荆义田想的更快：他连行李都没打开，就号召几个人跟司机到百里之外的玛纳斯河去拉钻井用水和吃喝水。
    7月6日，柴油机发动了！钻机旋转了！天车工作了！
    在这辽阔的戈壁滩上，不知寂寞了多少个世纪，现在，“轰轰隆隆！叮叮当当！”地演奏起来。多么美的音乐啊！小伙子们听着，感到自己工作的意义，愉快和自豪的心情从眼神里闪烁出来。
    但是，这里终归是荒无人烟的戈壁滩！太阳毒得晒裂石头，一片云就会变成一阵暴雨。有一天夜里刮一场暴风，第二天衣服脸盆漱口缸都找不见了。更使人咒诅的是：野蚊子、野苍蝇、牛虻等不分昼夜地向他们“袭击”！
    工作和生活条件是艰苦的。可是，在这些艰苦日子里，党经常捎信来问有什么困难？需要什么帮助？并且还一再派领导同志前来看望。小伙子们感到党的温暖，意志更加坚决，于是提出了响亮口号：
    “安下心、扎下根，不出油，不死心！”
    经过一百多个日日夜夜的战斗，到了10月29日下午，全队人都知道这口探井钻到该“分晓”时候了。是失败？是成功？悬在人人的心上。因此，下班的人不走，不该上班的人跑来围着井台，有守在防喷器旁边的，也有趴在泥浆池上找油花、闻油气儿的。
    喷油了！压藏在地底下多少亿万年的黑油，得见天日了！多么漂亮的颜色呀！黑里发蓝，蓝里闪光。
    石油工人，还有什么比“远征”打探井打出油来更喜悦的呢？跳呀，唱呀，拥抱呀，还有像“泼水节”一样蘸起原油来往对方脸上、身上涂抹呀……狂欢一直沸腾到深夜。
          家在哪里
    上帝创造世界是神话，我们劳动创造世界是现实。克拉玛依的发展简直像神话，从打开第一口井到现在，仅仅只有四年多，而今，在这一片戈壁上，已经建立起拥有数万人口的城市了。真是“从无到有”，而且“有”的这么快！
    四年前，这里只来了一位燕大夫，他经常提着药包去“行医”；工人找他来看病时候，地窝子里三张床，有两张是另外两个单位人员办公兼睡觉，燕大夫这张兼作诊断、处方和病床。而今，准噶尔路的医院大楼，三层上下设着九个科，病床设了三百多张。
    新华书店，当初就装在小朱的麻袋里，饭堂门口、井架前摆流动书摊。现在，总店和分店，单是去年就售出五十多万册书。
    当初，小马的挎包儿就装着邮电局。送信是：听口音、看面孔、询问；收信是：卖邮票、信封信纸、兼代封信口贴邮票，甚至还代写书信。而今，邮电人员增到一百多还忙不过来，长途电话和电报通到全国各大城市。听三年半以前从上海调来的顾局长说：今年要盖邮电大楼，将安装四千门自动电话，还要装设传真。
    各类商店的总店、分店分设在市区的各条街；十字路口，人民警察指挥着过往车辆和行人；天山路的中苏友谊馆，白天晚上没断过出出进进的工人；电影院、男女浴室、理发馆、各族饭馆等等，都是像大城市里的一样生意兴隆。总之一句话：从“开天辟地”仅仅只有四年半的历史，这种神话，只有我们社会主义国家才会实现。
      振奋人心的大油田
    克拉玛依的探井，像石油战线上的触角，大踏步向四外伸展着。打探井的工人们，几乎打一口井向党委报一次喜！克拉玛依的生产井的井架，在这一带热闹的戈壁滩上，逐渐地成林成行了。
    井架，完成了钻井任务，一座一座地向前进展——工人们创造了“整体搬家”，几十米高的“钢塔”，用十几辆拖拉机整体地拉着，真称得起“大将军八面威风”！
    每口井钻完后，就安装起“采油树”。钻多少井，就安多少采油树。从采油树上接出来的输油管子，像蜘蛛网一样，纵横交错地密布在戈壁滩地下。采油计量站，一座一座地建立起来。采油工人们，驯服着地下的油海，让它有计划地、昼夜不停地从地心里涌上来。然后，再把这黑金液压送到需要它的地方。
    克拉玛依，就这样从第一口井开始，打到现在，成批成批的油井打了出来。
    这些井有没有失败的呢？一直在克拉玛依矿务局担任局长的秦峰同志很有风趣地说：“这里打的井差不多都喷油。也有很少井，打了半天放个屁。可是没关系！等化学工业赶上来的时候，一井屁（瓦斯）也是一井宝呐！只有钻出个干眼眼，那算失败了。不过这种井百不抽一。”
    克拉玛依大油田的储藏量，究竟有多大？直到现在，还正在进行探摸它的边缘呢！
      英雄们的事迹
    去年国庆后，克拉玛依有五位英雄——胡宝珊、张云清、卡一霞、孙玉亭、赵仁杰代表全矿职工到北京出席全国群英会。当我听到英雄们所创造的英雄事迹的时候，使我从心里喊出来：
    总路线万岁！大跃进万岁！
    钻井队长张云清，这个贫农的儿子，到部队里才学了点文化，转业后1954年到玉门第一次看见钻井用的泥浆，三年前调到了克拉玛依。
    1958年春天，总路线照亮了张云清的眼睛，大跃进解放了他的思想。张云清向全队人提出个问题：钻井有进尺，难道只能月钻五百米上下吗？咱们不能跃进？大伙出个主意，一月钻它一千，一年钻它一万！
    “月上千、年上万！”从张云清一提出来，立刻遭到保守思想的反对。是的，钻井是硬碰硬的事儿，用钢钻头在岩石上钻。况且，那时，在全国还没有听见谁说过一月能钻一千米。因此，保守的“学者”就讽刺为“妄想”；对于张云清井队提出的技术革新，说是“走独木桥，是汽车不要刹把”。
    张云清没有被冷水泼倒，他听到了党的声音：
    “干吧，党支持你们！”
    3月初提出，3月底就实现了。
    多少人都为这全国第一个“月上千”的胜利欢欣鼓舞，而保守者却不甘心伤害他个人的自尊，于是又说“这是偶然”。
    张云清再也不理这类阻碍，他一心想着人民的利益和玉门老朋友王进喜井队的友谊竞赛。
    从4月到11月的七个月中，不但月月上千，而且逐渐地月上双千、三千、四千、一跃达到月钻四千三百零一米！
    真是“难能可贵”啊！工人们由于敢想、敢说、敢干，就给国家创造了无法计算的财富！
    “学张云清、赶张云清、超张云清！”克拉玛依掀起了这个运动，1958年全矿有二百四十个队次达到月上千。转业军人、钻井队长孙玉亭，这个辽宁阜新的青年更是猛冲猛打，1959年他们井队居然钻了两万米！
      向石油工人致敬
    黄昏，当千家万户点起灯火的时候，当人们乘坐着汽车或飞机轮船的时候，当开动了柴油机带动着机器生产和开着拖拉机耕地的时候，当人们走在下雨不泥泞、刮风不起土的柏油马路上的时候，都会联想到石油。因为汽油、煤油、柴油、沥青等等都是石油炼制的。
    可是，当我来到克拉玛依看到钻井工人、采油工人的时候——他们和她们的身上、手上甚至面孔上，都带着石油的油渍和泥浆点子。多美啊！还有什么色彩比带着满身劳动的标志更美。我从他们身上闻到一阵阵石油香味，我真想跑上前去拥抱他们。
    男女石油工人们，日日夜夜地战斗在戈壁滩上，烈日晒着，刮风下雨，他们都不停钻、不停采。戈壁滩上遍地铺着白雪，近几天来经常是零下四十多度，阿尔泰山上的寒风又常常袭来，就在这样天寒地冻的戈壁滩上，可敬的石油工人们，不退缩、不畏惧，仍然是不停地钻、不停地采！因为，石油工人们深深地理解：工农业生产需要石油、国防建设需要石油、人民生活需要石油！
    最近，当火车开到哈密的消息传来的时候，石油工人们的干劲更是热火朝天了。人人提出了更大的跃进指标，保证开门红、月月红、红到底，为了迎接不久的将来火车通到克拉玛依！工人们说的好：
    “过去，只有几百辆汽车来运咱们的原油，火车很快就要通到克拉玛依了，到时候，咱们一定要叫它天天都满车满车地开出去！”
    多么豪迈的英雄气概啊！
    啊！克拉玛依！四年多以前，你还是一片荒无人烟的戈壁滩，而今，你已经是拥有数万人的城市。在你身边，每天每夜都有几万男女英雄和大自然斗争着，他们从地心里取出宝来，要输送到全国各地。这怎不叫我向你歌颂、向你致敬：
    你这可爱的克拉玛依石油城！
    你这可敬的克拉玛依英雄城！
                      1960年1月24日
                          于克拉玛依
