A technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations is vigorously unfolding in many parts of the country with overwhelming momentum. In many places, loading and unloading workers, construction workers, coal miners, foundry workers, cooks in canteens, breeders in pig farms, and many others who do manual labor have been liberated from heavy physical labor, greatly improving labor efficiency. This great transformation of mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations points out a broad path to achieving a sustained and comprehensive leap forward in the national economy. All industries and sectors across the country, whether in industry or agriculture, commerce or transportation, production departments or service industries, should immediately take action and vigorously promote the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations. This is of profound and great significance for realizing the continued leap forward of the national economy in 1960 and for rapidly improving the level of production technology in our country, thereby rapidly changing the face of our nation.

The current technical innovation and technical revolution movement is, of course, not limited to the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement in industrial production includes extremely rich content such as improving design, improving technology, improving equipment, improving tools, improving labor organization, and studying the comprehensive utilization and conservation and substitution of raw materials. In some newly built or renovated modern large enterprises, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is further developing in the direction of automation and semi-automation. On some labor fronts that mainly use relatively simple production tools, such as the agricultural production front, the short-distance transportation front, and the small-scale water conservancy front, the main content of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is still tool reform. However, for the country as a whole, the most prominent center of the current technical innovation and technical revolution movement is the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations. Only by concentrating the technical innovation and technical revolution movement on this aspect, and launching a nationwide upsurge in the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations in all industries and sectors, so that all necessary and possible manual labor using machines can be mechanized or semi-mechanized, can the national economy be continuously and rapidly developed.

The technical innovation and technical revolution movement, with the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations as its center, marks that the technical innovation and technical revolution movement has entered a new stage. This is one of the important contents of the new stage of socialist construction. The new stage of socialist construction is a stage of high-speed development of socialist construction. To meet the needs of the high-speed development of socialist construction, there must also be a leap forward in production technology. This is mainly the transition from manual operation to mechanized and semi-mechanized operation. In the production field of our country, there is still a large part of manual operation. This is a historical trace left over from old China. Over the past ten years, the technical level of industry in our country has been greatly improved, and the number of various agricultural machinery has also increased greatly, but manual operation still accounts for a large proportion in the entire production field. It is well known that current agricultural production is mainly manual labor. In industry and transportation, the proportion of manual labor is also not small. For example, Shenyang is one of the cities with a better industrial base in our country, but there are still 54.23% of workers engaged in manual operations. The situation in other cities with a weaker industrial base can be imagined. From a national perspective, many important industrial, capital construction, and transportation sectors such as transportation, loading and unloading, construction, mining, crushing, casting, forging, assembly, and packaging still rely on manual operation. These departments, which mainly use manual operation, without exception occupy a large amount of labor force and have relatively low production efficiency, and therefore are far from meeting the needs of the sustained leap forward of the national economy. The solution to this contradiction is definitely not to invest millions or tens of millions more laborers; in fact, it is impossible to extract so many laborers. The only way out is to realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations, so that the labor productivity of these departments can be greatly improved, not only increasing production without increasing personnel, but also extracting people to support the continued leap forward of other departments. According to a survey in Shenyang, as long as the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization is increased from 45.77% to 70%, labor productivity can be increased by more than 10%, and about 100,000 laborers can be saved while ensuring the leap forward in production. What a huge potential, what a broad path to the leap forward!

Achieving the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations is a mass movement. All industries and sectors must vigorously promote the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations. The importance of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the industrial sector is relatively easy for everyone to understand. As for agriculture, although the mechanization of agriculture will take a considerable period of time, the current technical innovation and technical revolution movement in agriculture is mainly tool reform, but semi-mechanization is already an urgent issue in real life. Not only do many agricultural tools, water conservancy tools, and field transportation tools need to be semi-mechanized, but the manual labor of various economic undertakings and collective welfare undertakings in rural areas also urgently needs to be semi-mechanized. For example, in pig raising, based on the current calculation of one breeder raising 30 pigs, if the whole country achieves "one person one pig", then the country will need about 20 million breeders, which accounts for about 20% of the total rural labor force. Obviously, it is impossible to do without technical innovation. Now, many places have achieved the mechanization of feed transportation, the mechanization and semi-mechanization of feed crushing, and many innovations in other feeding methods and feeding tools, which have greatly improved feeding efficiency and saved labor. It can be seen that it is also necessary and possible to replace manual operations with indigenous mechanization and semi-mechanization in a planned and step-by-step manner in agriculture. Taking the transportation industry as another example, the current transportation tasks are very heavy, but the loading and unloading work in many places is manual operation, which is less efficient and takes too long, greatly affecting the turnover of vehicles and ships. Taking commerce as another example, with the vigorous development of industrial and agricultural production, the workload of all links such as purchasing, transferring, storing, processing, and sales has increased unprecedentedly. If the manual labor in these links is not transformed towards mechanization and semi-mechanization, it will be difficult to adapt to the needs of the situation. For example, purchasing requires bundling and weighing, goods entering the warehouse require carrying, lifting, and picking, and a large amount of manual labor in service industries such as catering, laundry, and sewing urgently needs to be mechanized and semi-mechanized.

Now, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations has made great progress. However, it must be seen that the development of this movement is still uneven. Some industries are better, some are worse; some places are better, some are worse. The current task is to rapidly promote the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations to all industries and sectors and all regions across the country, and not to achieve the goal of mechanization and semi-mechanization at a general speed, but to achieve this goal at a high speed. The most fundamental link in launching a mechanization and semi-mechanization movement in all industries and sectors is that party committees at all levels take the lead. They must show the same determination and boldness as they did in the mass steelmaking and large-scale water conservancy projects and vigorously promote the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations. After two years of the Great Leap Forward, many favorable conditions have been created for realizing the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations. All regions across the country have built their own iron and steel industries and machinery industries, cultivated a large number of technical forces, and accumulated many new technical experiences; especially important is that the revolutionary enthusiasm and creative spirit of the vast number of workers and commune members have been further developed. These have created an extremely favorable situation for realizing the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations. In fact, in many places, the speed of party committees taking the lead, mobilizing the masses, and realizing the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations is very amazing. In a short period of time, Tianjin has increased the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization from 42% last year to 54%; Shashi has generally realized the mechanization and semi-mechanization of heavy physical labor and manual operations throughout the city in one and a half months; the clothing industry in Shenyang ended the history of using foot pedals for sewing machines in just twelve days; at the end of last year, all of the more than 2,900 pig farms in Shouzhang County, Shandong, had achieved the mechanization and semi-mechanization of feed crushing; the more than 1,000 rural public canteens in Tunliu County, Shanxi, basically realized the mechanization and semi-mechanization of cooking tools in only half a month. It can be seen that it is entirely possible for party committees to take the lead, fully utilize favorable conditions, and achieve the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations at a high speed.

To realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses. To vigorously promote the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations, it is necessary not for a few people to do it, but for everyone to do it; not for a few industries to do it, but for all industries and sectors to do it; in short, it is necessary to do it by vigorously launching mass movements. The historical experience of socialist construction proves that the development of socialist construction, just like the development of socialist revolution, must vigorously launch mass movements. The mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations is a revolution in production tools. However, all reforms of production tools require people to study; the inherent potential efficiency of all new production tools also requires people to explore in order to be fully utilized. Relying only on a few people to engage in technical innovation, without the active participation of the broad masses of people, the realization of the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations will inevitably be slow and difficult. Getting rid of backward manual operations and realizing mechanization and semi-mechanization is the urgent desire of the broad masses. This strong desire of the broad masses will burst forth with infinite wisdom and power. We must mobilize all the people in the country, whether they are workers, farmers, scientists, salespersons, breeders, or cooks, to popularize the mechanization and semi-mechanization movement in every corner of the country and rapidly make a huge change in the production technology of our country.

The mass movement for the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations is unfolding widely throughout the country. The important task of party committees at all levels is to quickly start strengthening specific leadership over this movement. The first is to make plans, clarify goals, and enable the broad masses of people to advance bravely along a clear direction. When implementing the plan, it is necessary to closely combine it with the needs of production, first reform those manual operation parts that cost less, are easy to do, have great effects, are quick to take effect, and save people, and never deviate from the urgent needs of production and engage in mechanization for the sake of mechanization; and it is necessary to adhere to the principle of "walking on two legs", with self-reliance as the main focus, adopting foreign methods if possible, and indigenous methods if foreign methods are not possible, advocating the use of indigenous methods to achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization, and never emphasizing foreign over indigenous or big over small. In order to ensure the smooth progress of mechanization and semi-mechanization, relevant departments must allocate a portion of the necessary materials for manufacturing equipment.

"Carrying poles, carrying poles, heroes are bent over." For thousands of years, I don't know how many people's youth has been buried under this backward production tool. After liberation, the working people became the masters of the country, and the significance of labor was fundamentally different. "The same burden seems to be half lighter." The people believe that in a society where the people are the masters, one day they will be able to put down the carrying pole and put down all backward manual tools. Now, the moment to realize this possibility has arrived. Of course, realizing the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations, and using machines for all labor that can use machines, will still be a gradual process that will take some time. However, such a day is not far away. Let us take active action, use all favorable factors, overcome all difficulties, and rapidly achieve greater and better results in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations, and complete and overfulfill the plan for continued leap forward this year!

    开展一个手工操作机械化半机械化的全民运动
    一个以手工操作机械化和半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，正以排山倒海之势，在全国许多地方蓬勃开展起来。许多地方的装卸工人、建筑工人、攉煤工人、铸锻工人、食堂里的炊事员、养猪场里的饲养员以及其他许多做手工活的，已经从繁重的体力劳动下解放出来，大大提高了劳动效率。手工操作机械化和半机械化这个伟大的变革，指出了一条实现国民经济持续的全面跃进的宽阔道路。全国各行各业，不论是工业和农业，不论是商业和运输业，也不论是生产部门和服务行业，都应该立即行动起来，大搞手工操作机械化和半机械化。这对于实现1960年国民经济的继续跃进，对于迅速提高我国的生产技术水平，从而迅速地改变我们国家的面貌，有着极其深刻的伟大的意义。
    目前的技术革新和技术革命运动，当然并不限于实现手工操作的机械化和半机械化。工业生产的技术革新和技术革命运动就包括有改进设计、改进工艺、改进设备、改进工具、改善劳动组织、研究原材料的综合利用和节约代用等等极其丰富的内容。在一些新建或者改建的现代化大企业里，技术革新和技术革命运动更进一步向着自动化和半自动化的方向发展。在一些主要还是使用比较简陋的生产工具的劳动战线上，例如农业生产战线上、短途运输战线上、小型水利战线上，技术革新和技术革命运动的主要内容还是工具改革。但是，就全国来说，目前技术革新和技术革命运动最突出的中心，是实现手工操作的机械化和半机械化。只有把技术革新和技术革命运动集中到这方面来，在全国各行各业掀起一个手工操作机械化和半机械化的高潮，使一切必需而又可能使用机器的手工劳动都实现机械化或者半机械化，才能不断地高速度地发展国民经济。
    技术革新和技术革命运动以手工操作机械化和半机械化为中心，标志着技术革新和技术革命运动已经进入一个新的阶段。这是社会主义建设新阶段的重要内容之一。社会主义建设新阶段是社会主义建设事业高速度发展的阶段。适应社会主义建设事业高速度发展的需要，在生产技术上也必需有一个飞跃。这主要的是由手工操作过渡到机械化和半机械化操作。在我国的生产领域中至今还存在有很大的手工操作部分。这是旧中国遗留下来的历史的痕迹。十年来，我国工业的技术水平已经有了很大的提高，各种农业机械的数量也有了很大的增加，但是在整个生产领域中手工操作还占有很大比重。当前的农业生产主要是手工劳动，这是大家都了解的。工业和运输业中，手工劳动占的比重也不小。例如，沈阳是我国工业基础比较好的城市之一，但那里仍有54．23％的工人从事手工操作。别的工业基础较差的城市，情况更可想而知。从全国来看，运输、装卸、建筑、采掘、碎矿、铸造、锻造、装配、包装等许多重要的工业、基本建设和交通运输部门，还存在手工操作。这些主要采用手工操作的部门，毫无例外地都占用了大量的劳动力，生产效率比较低，因而远远不能适应国民经济持续跃进的需要。解决这个矛盾，决不是再投入几百万、成千万劳动力，事实上也不可能抽出这么多的劳动力来。唯一的出路就是实现手工操作的机械化和半机械化，使这些部门的劳动生产率大大提高，不但增产不要增人，而且抽出人来支援其他部门的继续跃进。据沈阳市的调查，只要使机械化和半机械化的程度从45．77％提高到70％，就能使劳动生产率提高10％以上，在保证生产跃进的前提下，可以节约出十万个左右的劳动力来。这是多么巨大的潜力，多么广阔的跃进的道路啊！
    实现手工操作机械化和半机械化，是一个全民的运动。各行各业都要大搞手工操作机械化和半机械化。工业方面实行机械化和半机械化的重要性是大家比较容易理解的。至于农业方面，农业的机械化虽然要经过一段相当的时期，目前农业的技术革新和技术革命运动主要还是工具改革，但是半机械化已经是现实生活中的一个迫切问题。不仅许多农具、水利工具、田间运输工具，需要半机械化；而且农村各种经济事业和集体福利事业的手工劳动，也迫切需要实现半机械化。例如养猪，照现在一个饲养员一般养三十头猪计算，如果全国做到“一个人一头猪”，那么全国就需要二千万左右的饲养员，这就占去了全国农村壮劳动力的20％左右，很显然，不实行技术革新是不行的。现在，不少地方已经实现了饲料运送车子化、饲料切碎的机械化和半机械化以及其他饲养方法和饲养工具上的许多革新，大大提高了饲养工效，节省了劳动力。可见，在农业方面有计划有步骤地用土机械化半机械化来代替手工操作也是必要的和可能实现的。又拿交通运输业来说，目前运输任务十分繁重，而许多地方的装卸工作是手工操作的，效率较低，装卸时间过长，大大影响车船的周转。再拿商业来说，随着工农业生产的蓬勃发展，收购、调运、储存、加工、销售各个环节的工作量都空前的增加了，如果这些环节的手工劳动不朝机械化和半机械化变革，就很难适应形势的需要。例如，收购要捆绑、过秤，商品入库要背、扛、抬、挑，饮食业、洗染业、缝纫业等服务行业中大量的手工劳动，都迫切需要实现机械化和半机械化。
    现在，以手工操作机械化和半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动已经有了很大的发展。但是，必须看到，这个运动的发展还是不平衡的。有些行业好一些，有些行业差一些；有些地方好一些，有些地方差一些。当前的任务，就是要把以手工操作机械化和半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，迅速推向全国各行各业、各个地区，并且不是用一般的速度实现机械化和半机械化的目标，而是用高速度来实现这个目标。掀起一个各行各业的机械化、半机械化运动的最根本的环节是各级党委挂帅，要拿出像大炼钢铁、大办水利那样的决心和气魄，大搞手工操作机械化和半机械化。经过两年的大跃进，实现手工操作机械化和半机械化已经具备了许多有利的条件。全国各个地区都建设起自己的钢铁工业和机械工业，培养了大批的技术力量，积累了许多新的技术经验；特别重要的是，广大职工和公社社员的革命的干劲和创造精神得到更大的发扬。这些，都为实现手工操作机械化和半机械化造成了极其有利的形势。事实上，许多地方党委挂帅，发动群众，实现手工操作机械化和半机械化的速度都是非常惊人的。天津在很短的时间里，已经使机械化和半机械化程度从去年的42％提高到54％；沙市在一个半月的时间内使全市笨重的体力劳动和手工操作普遍实现机械化和半机械化；沈阳的服装业仅十二天的时间就结束了缝纫机用脚踏的历史；山东寿张县二千九百多个养猪场去年年底已全部实现饲料切碎机械化和半机械化；山西屯长县一千多个农村公共食堂只用半个月的时间就基本上实现了炊事工具机械化和半机械化。可见，党委挂帅，充分运用有利条件，高速度实现手工操作机械化和半机械化，是完全可能的。
    实现手工操作机械化和半机械化，必须充分发动群众。要大搞手工操作机械化和半机械化，必需不是少数人搞，而是全民搞；不是少数行业搞，而是各行各业都搞；总之，是用大搞群众运动的办法搞。社会主义建设的历史经验证明，社会主义建设事业的发展，正如同社会主义革命事业的发展一样，都必须大搞群众运动。手工操作的机械化和半机械化是生产工具的革命，但是，一切生产工具的改革，都需要人去研究；一切新的生产工具所固有的潜在效率，也都需要人去挖掘，才能得到充分发挥。只靠少数人搞技术革新，没有广大人民群众的积极行动，实现手工操作机械化和半机械化必然是缓慢的，也是很困难的。摆脱落后的手工操作，实现机械化和半机械化，是广大群众的迫切的愿望。广大人民群众这种强烈的愿望，将喷发出无穷无尽的智慧和力量。我们一定要把全国人民，不管是工人，是农民，是科学家，是售货员，是饲养员，是炊事员，统统发动起来，让手工操作机械化和半机械化运动普及到全国每一个角落，迅速使我们国家的生产技术面貌有一个巨大的改变。
    手工操作机械化和半机械化群众运动正在全国范围内广泛展开，各级党委的重要任务，是迅速动手加强对这个运动的具体领导。首先是做出规划，明确目标，使广大人民群众沿着鲜明的方向奋勇前进。在实现规划的时候，要紧密结合生产的需要，首先改革那些花钱少、容易搞、效果大、见效快、省人多的手工操作部分，决不要离开生产的迫切需要，为搞机械化而搞机械化；并且要坚持贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，以自力更生为主，能洋就洋，不能洋就土，提倡用土办法实现机械化和半机械化，决不要重洋轻土，重大轻小。为了使机械化和半机械化得以顺利进行，有关部门必需拨出一部分必需的材料，供制造设备之用。
    “扁担挑、扁担挑，好汉压成偻窝腰”。千百年来，不知有多少人的青春埋没在这种落后的生产工具底下。解放以后，劳动人民成为国家的主人，劳动的意义根本不同了，“同样一副担子，好像轻了一半”。人民群众相信，在人民当家作主的社会里，总有一天能放下扁担，放下一切落后的手工工具。现在，实现这个可能性的时刻已经到来。当然，实现手工操作机械化和半机械化，使一切能够使用机器的劳动都使用机器，仍然会有一个逐步发展的过程，需要经过一段时间。但是，这样的日子已经不远了。让我们积极行动起来，运用一切有利因素，战胜一切困难，使以手工操作机械化半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动迅速取得更大更好的效果，完成和超额完成今年继续跃进的计划！
