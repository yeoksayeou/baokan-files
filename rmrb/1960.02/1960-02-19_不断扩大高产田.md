    Constantly Expanding High-Yield Fields
    Shu Jia
    With the continuous Great Leap Forward in agricultural production over the past two years, the area of high-yield fields has also been expanding. In this year's summer harvest crops such as wheat and rapeseed, high-yield fields in many areas have reached about 30%. These high-yield fields have conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" and have been cultivated and managed to a high standard in accordance with the requirements for high-yield production, so the crops are growing very well. Whether it is wheat or rapeseed, they are currently growing strongly, indicating that a foundation has been laid for this year's summer bumper harvest.
    Requiring that a portion of all farmland achieve high-yield production can not only increase total output but also establish high-yield models, boost people's confidence in striving for even greater harvests, and encourage ordinary fields to learn from and emulate high-yield fields. Therefore, doing a good job of cultivating high-yield fields is of great significance. Of course, while doing a good job of cultivating high-yield fields, we must also strengthen the management of ordinary fields and cultivate them well. Because the purpose of cultivating high-yield fields is to improve ordinary fields so that they can gradually catch up with high-yield fields, only then can we achieve greater harvests. Therefore, we must resolutely implement the policy of "more yield from more planting" and "more yield from high yield" in our work.
    In order to achieve even greater harvests, high-yield fields should continuously develop and advance. The so-called development mainly has two aspects: one is that the area of high-yield fields should continuously expand, so that the proportion of high-yield fields in all farmland becomes larger and larger, and the original high-yield fields can be developed into high-yield plots, high-yield squares...; the other is that the production targets of high-yield fields should continuously improve, with the original planned output of 500 jin gradually increasing to 600 jin, 700 jin, 800 jin, 1,000 jin or more... The continuous development and advancement of high-yield fields will continuously increase the yield per unit area, continuously increase total output, and continuously leap forward the entire agricultural front.
    In order to make this year's summer harvest crops achieve greater harvests, and in order to continuously expand the area of high-yield fields and continuously improve the yield per unit area, the Wenjiang Special District of Sichuan Province has adopted the following measures in the field management of this year's summer harvest crops: manage the original high-yield fields with high-standard measures and methods so that high-yield fields truly become the flag of ordinary fields; and use the effective measures in high-yield fields to carefully manage ordinary fields, promote ordinary fields to catch up with high-yield fields, and expand the area of high-yield fields. Many ordinary fields have increased their production increase targets and increased production increase measures. The masses are working hard and strengthening management. The area of high-yield wheat fields in the district has expanded from 30% of the total area at the initial sowing to 50%; the area of high-yield rapeseed fields has also expanded from the original 30% to more than 90%. And many of the original high-yield demonstration fields for cadres and high-yield fields have gradually expanded into demonstration plots, high-yield dams, and bumper harvest roads (all high-yield fields are along both sides of a road). The method of Wenjiang Special District in strengthening the field management of summer harvest crops with high standards and continuously expanding high-yield fields is a good method. It embodies the spirit of continuous revolution, and also reflects the ambition of the people of Wenjiang area to seize high yields of summer harvest crops and create more material wealth for socialism. This spirit of continuous revolution and the method of expanding high-yield fields are all worth learning.

    不断扩大高产田
    蜀嘉
    随着两年来农业生产的连续大跃进，高产田的面积也愈来愈大。在今年的小麦、油菜等夏收作物中，许多地区高产田都达到30％左右。这些高产田由于认真贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，按照高额丰产的要求进行了高标准的耕作管理，因而庄稼都生长得很好。不论是小麦还是油菜，目前都是苗肥叶茂，看来已为今年的夏季大丰产打下了基础。
    要求在全部农田中，有一部分农田达到高额丰产，这不仅可以增加总产量，而且可以树立高产榜样，鼓舞人们争取更大丰收的信心，带动一般田向高产田学习、看齐。因此，种好高产田意义很大。当然，在种好高产田的同时，也要加强对一般田的管理，种好一般田。因为种高产田的目的，就是为了提高一般田，使一般田也能逐步赶上高产田，才能取得更大丰收。因此，我们在工作中必须坚决贯彻多种多收和高产多收的方针。
    为了取得更大的丰收，高产田应当不断发展，不断前进。所谓发展，主要有两个方面：一是高产田的面积不断扩大，使高产田在全部农田中的比例愈来愈大，原来的高产田可以发展成为高产片、高产方……；一是高产田的生产指标不断提高，原来的计划产量是五百斤的，逐渐增长为六百斤、七百斤、八百斤、一千斤以上……。高产田的不断发展，不断前进，就会使单位面积产量不断提高，总产量不断增加，整个的农业战线不断跃进。
    为了使今年的夏收作物获得更大的丰收，为了使高产田的面积不断扩大，单位产量不断提高，四川省温江专区在今年夏收作物的田间管理中，采取了既用高标准的措施和方法管理原有的高产田，使高产田真正成为一般田的旗帜；又用高产田中行之有效的措施，精心管理一般田，促使一般田的禾苗赶上高产田，扩大高产田的面积。许多一般田由于提高了增产指标，增加了增产措施，群众鼓足干劲，加强了管理，全区小麦高产田已由最初播种时占总面积的30％扩大到50％；油菜高产田的面积也由原来的30％扩大到90％以上。而许多原来的干部高产指挥田和高额丰产田，已逐渐扩大为指挥片、高产坝和丰产路（沿一条路两旁全是高产田）。温江专区这种用高标准加强夏收作物田间管理、不断扩大高产田的方法，是一种好方法。它体现了不断革命的精神，也反映了温江地区人民誓夺夏收作物高产和为社会主义创造更多的物质财富的雄心壮志。这种不断革命的精神和扩大高产田的方法，都是值得学习的。
