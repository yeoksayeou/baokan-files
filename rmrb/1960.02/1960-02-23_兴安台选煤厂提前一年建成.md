Xinhua News Agency, Harbin: The Xing'antai Coal Preparation Plant in Hegang, with an annual processing capacity of 1.5 million tons of raw coal, has been completed one year ahead of schedule and was officially handed over for production on the 18th. After inspection by the State Acceptance Committee, the project was deemed to be of excellent quality and in compliance with design requirements.

At the handover ceremony, Chen Jianfei, Vice Governor of Heilongjiang Province, Gao Tieying, Deputy Director of the Technical Department of the Ministry of Coal Industry, and Fedotov, representative of the Soviet State Committee for Foreign Economic Relations, delivered speeches. Gao Tieying and Chen Jianfei, on behalf of the Ministry of Coal Industry and the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee respectively, warmly congratulated the successful completion and commissioning of the Xing'antai Coal Preparation Plant, and thanked the Soviet Union for its tremendous assistance. Fedotov, the representative of the Soviet State Committee for Foreign Economic Relations, warmly congratulated the addition of new strength to China's coal industry in his speech.

The Xing'antai Coal Preparation Plant was designed with Soviet assistance, and the main mechanical equipment was also provided by the Soviet Union. The entire production process of this coal preparation plant, from raw coal transportation, screening, and elimination to washing and selecting refined coal, dewatering, drying, and slime recovery, is mechanized and automated. No one is required to operate on-site; it is entirely controlled by remote control panels using buttons. The coal preparation plant is located next to the Xing'antai vertical shaft, which the Soviet Union helped China build, forming a unified transportation system.

This modern coal preparation plant has a complex engineering structure and very strict technical requirements for construction. The entire staff of the Hegang Construction Company, which undertook this glorious construction task, under the leadership of the Party and with the assistance of Soviet experts, promoted the advanced experience of multi-shift three-dimensional cross-operations in the construction of the main plant, completed the construction task of the main plant 140 days ahead of schedule, avoided winter construction, saved the state more than 100,000 yuan in winter construction costs, and reduced the project cost by 12%, thus receiving a reward from the Ministry of Coal Industry. During construction, it also received support from many fraternal factories and mines.

    兴安台选煤厂提前一年建成
    据新华社哈尔滨电　每年能处理原煤一百五十万吨的鹤岗兴安台选煤厂，已经提前一年建成，在18日下午正式移交生产。这项工程经国家验收委员会验收，认为质量优良，符合设计要求。
    在移交生产的仪式上，黑龙江省副省长陈剑飞、煤炭工业部技术司副司长高铁英和苏联国家对外经济关系委员会代表费多道夫都讲了话。高铁英和陈剑飞分别代表煤炭工业部和中共黑龙江省委、省人民委员会，热烈祝贺兴安台选煤厂胜利建成和投入生产，感谢苏联的巨大援助。苏联国家对外经济关系委员会代表费多道夫在讲话中，热情洋溢地祝贺我国煤炭工业上又增加了新生力量。
    兴安台选煤厂是苏联帮助设计的，主要机械设备也是由苏联提供的。这座选煤厂从原煤运进、筛分、淘汰，到洗选出精煤、脱水、干燥和煤泥回收等，全部生产过程都是机械化、自动化的，不用人在现场操作，完全由远方控制台用电钮来操纵。选煤厂紧靠在苏联帮助我国建设的兴安台竖井旁边，组成统一的运输系统。
    这座现代化的选煤厂，工程结构复杂，施工技术要求非常严格。担负这项光荣建设任务的鹤岗建设公司全体职工，两年来在党的领导和苏联专家的帮助下，在主厂房施工中推广了多班立体交叉作业的先进经验，提前一百四十天完成了主厂房建筑任务，避免了冬季施工，为国家节约冬季施工费用十万多元，工程成本降低了12％，因而得到煤炭工业部的奖励。在建设中，还得到了许多兄弟厂矿的支援。
