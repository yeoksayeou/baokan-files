Many Creations in the Institute
    —A Record of the Xifeng County Farm Implement Research Institute in Liaoning
    By Our Correspondent, Lai Denong
    In an old courtyard, there are several dilapidated earthen houses with a sign hanging on the door: "Xifeng County Farm Implement Research Institute." There is no electric power equipment here, only a self-built oven and an earthen machine tool being made. Despite the simplicity of the research institute's equipment, it attended the National Agricultural Machinery Science and Technology Conference held in Beijing not long ago.
    The research institute has very few researchers, only eleven. However, it also employs more than fifty researchers in various people's communes throughout the county. These researchers, in turn, form farm implement research groups with skilled craftsmen from various communes, creating a farm implement research network throughout the county with the Farm Implement Research Institute as its core. The researchers in the institute are all "local experts" gathered from people's communes throughout the county. In terms of education, the highest is equivalent to a senior primary school graduate, and the lowest has never attended school, but they are all pioneers in the farm implement reform movement. This home-grown research institute has made many admirable achievements in farm implement reform in the half-year since its establishment.
    The Story of Mixing Oil and Water
    Although this is a research institute, not many people know the molecular formula of H2O—water—that water is composed of two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen. The director is Li Haicheng, the head of the county's Electrical and Mechanical Bureau, a young man with only four years of education. The state sent him to Beijing to study for a year the year before last, and he learned what H2O was all about. After returning from his studies, he often thought, "When the teacher talked about H2O, he said that oxygen can burn, right? Can we mix water with oil?" This question seemed too profound for him, and H2O often swirled in his mind. When he went to Beijing to attend the National Agricultural Machinery Science and Technology Conference, he bought a science pictorial in Shenyang and suddenly saw an article from the Soviet Union about mixing oil and water. He regarded it as a treasure and read it eagerly on the train. It seemed like he understood it, but he was blocked again at a critical point. During casual conversations at the conference in Beijing, he consulted some experts, but they were noncommittal, and some shook their heads and said: Probably not. One night, the conference held a theatrical reception at the Great Hall of the People, and he casually bought an evening paper and saw the news about adding water to the oil in bulldozers. He couldn't resist it. He asked the conference to introduce him to the Beijing Mechanized Construction Company for a visit. He found the bulldozer operator. This bulldozer was powered by mixing oil and water. He learned from this experience.
    After returning to Xifeng County, he held a forum and assigned the task to researcher Sun Wenkui. Sun Wenkui is a very creative person. He has already converted a thirty-eight horsepower automobile engine into a locomotive capable of pulling more than ten tons of earth. After accepting the new task, he and his comrades began experimenting on diesel engines. They improved some equipment and thought that boiling water had less sediment than cold water, so they switched to using cooled boiled water. The test results were very good. Burning pure diesel fuel consumed five pounds eight ounces per hour, while the oil-water mixture consumed four pounds eight ounces per hour and two pounds four ounces of water, saving one pound of oil per hour. The engine speed was the same as burning pure oil: one thousand two hundred revolutions per minute, and the temperature was balanced, the knocking force was small, which could extend the engine's life, and the exhaust pipe emitted white smoke instead of black smoke.
    Diesel Engine with Long Legs
    A person wearing grass-woven shoes with a piece of dog skin nailed to the bottom came to the research institute. He was Wang Wenren, an old blacksmith from the Helong People's Commune and a researcher at the institute. He came to participate in the county's diesel engine long-leg on-site meeting. In fact, he was representing the commune to introduce their experience. The diesel engine with long legs was first successfully tested by their commune. The diesel engine with long legs has become eye catching news in Xifeng County. Look, a diesel engine drove through the county street, and many people surrounded it as soon as it stopped. This is a twenty-horsepower high-speed diesel engine, a product of the state-owned Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory. In the mountainous area, this machine cannot be said to be not foreign or not new, but the farmers always have some opinions about it. Although it is a powerful power machine for threshing, irrigation and drainage, and milling machinery, and has many uses, it does not have long legs and requires more than twenty people to move it. Often, after threshing on one team in the morning, it has to be carried to another team in the afternoon. How much manpower and animal power does it take to carry more than two hundred diesel engines in the county! Liu Yingguo, the first secretary of the county party committee, saw this situation and called on people to find ways to put legs on the diesel engines, even if they were just four wheels to push. The skilled craftsmen of the Helong People's Commune launched research and, like nailing a large cart, installed a wooden frame on the diesel engine, and then installed three handcart wheels, with double wheels installed on the rear two; plus belts and axles, using the power of the diesel engine itself, they actually drove the diesel engine to the township people's committee two or three miles away. However, the belt was broken by the vibration, the turning was not flexible during driving, and the wheels also slipped. The Electrical and Mechanical Bureau and the Farm Implement Research Institute sent people to improve these shortcomings. Later, this diesel engine ran on the county street. This kept the county machinery factory busy, because their diesel engine was still being installed! The two long-legged diesel engines have the same principle, but the latter uses iron frames, V-belts, and single wheels. The diesel engine with long legs has become a soil tractor and a soil motorcycle, and has actually become a soil universal tractor. It can run more than thirty miles per hour, and its traction is one ton. Giving the diesel engine long legs not only turns a dead machine into a living machine—a stationary machine into a mobile machine—but also expands the machine's performance. This points out a new direction for factories to produce diesel engines for rural areas. The skilled craftsmen of the whole county gathered in the county to hold a diesel engine long-leg meeting. Based on the experience of the Helong People's Commune and the county machinery factory, all the diesel engines in the county were given long legs, ready for use in spring plowing.
    Icing on the Cake
    There is also a researcher in the institute named Wang Keren, who was originally an old carpenter. Before he was transferred from the commune to the research institute, he had many creations in the farm implement reform movement. The stray-grass beater he successfully trial-manufactured in the research institute is truly the icing on the cake for rice threshing. The rice thresher driven by a diesel engine was originally a threshing machine favored by farmers. However, after threshing with this powerful machine, there are still many rice ears mixed in the stray grass, and the farmers have to use a flail to thresh a small field again. Beating the stray grass is not only laborious, but also very difficult. Wang Keren created a stray-grass beater that can be used simultaneously with a rice thresher on a diesel engine, increasing efficiency by nineteen times compared to manual flailing of stray grass. Now, he is also researching a corn planter and manufacturing an earthen lathe for the research institute.
    Everything for the Peasants
    The Xifeng County Farm Implement Research Institute was established in June 1959. In just over half a year, it has become the research center for the county to summarize mass experience, create, modify, appraise, and promote farm implements. In a short period of time, they have created six kinds of farm implements, imitated seven kinds, and researched and improved more than one hundred and seventy inventions and creations of the masses, playing a vanguard role in the county's farm implement reform. They have hired researchers in various people's communes throughout the county, and established farm implement research groups in the farm implement repair and assembly stations of various communes, so that the tentacles of research work extend from all directions to the communes. Although the researchers hired outside the institute are considered people from the communes, they go to the institute regularly to hold researcher meetings, accept research tasks, and report to the institute on the farm implement reform situation of the masses. The researchers in the institute also often combine with the communes and the broad masses to study and reform farm implements. For example, the Zhenxing People's Commune's trial production of fast grinding and fast milling was participated in by all the people in the research institute. In the process of manufacturing winnowers, the research institute's researchers went deep into various townships to guide manufacturing, and assisted the Gaojiadian People's Commune in successfully trial-manufacturing sorghum and soybean threshers, and helped solve everything from drafting to the supply of raw materials. The research institute's researchers also often went to the masses to seek teachers and learn skills, absorb mass experience, and assist the masses in summarizing and improving farm implements. For example, the foot-operated rice thresher, which can only thresh more than seventy bundles a day per person, was changed to a water turbine driving two rice threshers after they discussed with the masses, which can thresh seven thousand bundles a day.
    This research institute adopted the principles of indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, starting with indigenous methods before foreign methods, adapting to local conditions, and using the method of serving the next season with the previous season and serving the second half of the year with the first half of the year. Therefore, farm implement reform often precedes the agricultural production season, and it can be used as soon as it is improved. Their method of promoting farm implements is to adopt the method of leadership, farm implements, and technology going to the fields, so as to achieve ideological communication, have tools, and guarantee good teaching.

    研究所里创造多
    ——记辽宁西丰县农具研究所
    本报记者　赖德浓
    在一个古老的院落里，有几间陈旧土房，门上挂着牌子：“西丰县农具研究所”。这里没有电动力设备，只有一个他们自己砌起来的烘炉，以及正在制作中的土机床。别看研究所的设备这样简单，可是，在不久以前，它却出席了在北京召开的全国农业机械科学技术会议。
    这个研究所的研究人员很少，只有十一名。但是，它在全县各人民公社还聘有五十多个研究员。这些研究员又和各公社的能工巧匠组成农具研究小组，使全县以农具研究所为核心，组成了一个农具研究网。所内的研究员也都是从全县人民公社集中起来的“土专家”，论文化水平，最高的相当于高小毕业，低的还没进过学校，可是他们都是农具改革运动中的闯将。这土生土长的研究所，成立以来半年中，已经为农具改革作出了不少令人敬佩的成绩。
    油水掺用的故事
    这虽然是个研究所，但知道H2O——水的分子式——水是由氢二氧一构成的并不多。所长是县机电局长李海城，一个仅有四年文化水平的小伙子，前年国家送他到北京学习一年才知道了H2O是怎么回事。学习回来以后，他常想：“老师讲H2O时说，氧不是可以燃烧吗？能不能把水掺在油内？”这个问题对他好像太深奥，H2O常在他心里打转转。他到北京开全国农业机械科学技术会议，路过沈阳买了一本科学画报，猛然看到一篇苏联论油水掺用的文章。他如获至宝，在火车上就如饥似渴地看，看得好像有点门儿了，但一到关键地方又给挡住了。在北京开会闲谈时，他曾请教过一些专家，都未置可否，有的摇头说：恐怕不行。一天晚上，大会在人民大会堂招待看戏，他顺手买了一张晚报，一下看到推土机油中掺水的消息，可耐不住了。他请求大会介绍他到北京机械化施工公司去参观。他找到了推土机手。这台推土机正是油中掺水发动的，他学习了这一经验。
    回到西丰县以后，他就召开座谈会，并把这个任务交给研究员孙文库负责。孙文库这个人很有创造性，他已经把三十八马力的汽车头改为能拉十多吨重的土火车头。接受新任务以后，他就和同志们在柴油机上开始试验。他们改进了一些设备，并且想到开水比冷水沉淀物少，改用了凉开水。试验结果很好，烧纯柴油每小时耗油五斤八两，油水混合每小时耗油四斤八两，耗水二斤四两，每小时节省油一斤。机器转动的速度和烧纯油一样：每分钟一千二百转，而且温度平衡，爆震力小，能延长机器寿命，同时排气管冒白烟而不再冒黑烟了。
    柴油机长腿
    一位穿草窝子鞋、底上还钉有一块狗皮的人来到研究所，他是和隆人民公社的老铁匠，是这个所的研究员王文仁。他来参加全县柴油机长腿现场会议。实际上，他是代表这个公社来介绍经验的。柴油机长腿，就是他们公社最先试验成功的。柴油机长腿的事变成
  了西丰县很引人注意的新闻。你看，一台柴油机从县街开过，一停下来就围上很多人。这是一台二十马力的高速柴油机，国营沈阳第二机床厂的产品。在山区，这种机器不能说不洋、不新，可是农民对它总有点意见。它虽然是脱谷、排灌、辗磨机械的强大动力机，有许多用途，但是它没有长腿，得二十多个人才能移动。常常上午在一个小队打完场，下午就得抬到另一个小队去。全县二百多台柴油机，得花多少人力畜力去抬！县委第一书记刘英国看见这种情况就号召设法给柴油机安上腿，哪怕安上四个轱辘推着走也行。和隆人民公社的能工巧匠展开了研究，像钉大车那样给柴油机装上木头架子，又装上手推车轮子三个，后面两个轮子还是装的双轮；再加上皮带和轮轴，利用柴油机本身的动力，居然哒哒哒地把柴油机开到了两三里地外的乡人民委员会。但是，皮带给震断了，在开动中转弯不灵，轮子也打滑。机电局和农具研究所派人去改进了这些缺点，以后，这台柴油机就在县街上跑起来。这可忙坏了县机械厂，因为他们研究的柴油机还正在安装呢！这两台长腿的柴油机原理一样，只是后者用的是铁架子、三角带、单轮子。这样长了腿的柴油机就变成了土拖拉机、土摩托车，实际上成了土万能拖拉机。它每小时可以跑三十多里，牵引力是一吨。给柴油机长腿不仅把死机器变为活机器——座机变为行机，而且把机器的性能扩大了。这就给工厂为农村生产柴油机指出了一个新的方向。全县的能工巧匠集中在县里开了柴油机长腿会，根据和隆人民公社和县机械厂的经验，把全县的柴油机都长上腿，准备在春耕中使用。
    锦上添花
    所内还有一位研究员叫王克仁，原是老木工。他从公社调到研究所以前，在农具改革运动中就有许多创造。他在研究所试制成功的打乱草机，真是使水稻脱谷锦上添花。柴油机带动的打稻机本来是农民喜欢的脱谷机械。但是，这个威力强大的机械脱谷以后，乱草中还夹有不少稻穗，农民还得用槤枷打一次小场。打乱草既费劳力，还很不好打。王克仁创造了一个打乱草机，可以同打稻机同时挂在一个柴油机上用，比人工用槤枷打乱草提高效率十九倍。现在，他又在研究玉米点播机和为研究所制造土旋床。
    一切为了农民
    西丰县农具研究所是在1959年6月兴办起来的。为时才半年多，它已经成为全县总结群众经验，创造、改制、鉴定、推广农具的研究中心。他们在短短的时间内，已经创制了农具六种，仿制的七种，并研究改进了群众的发明创造一百七十多种，对全县的农具改革起了尖兵作用。他们在全县各人民公社聘请了研究员，并在各公社农具修配站成立了农具研究小组，使研究工作的触角从四面八方伸展到公社中去。所外聘请的研究员虽然算公社的人，但他们定时到所开研究员会议，接受研究任务，并向研究所反映群众改革农具的情况。所内的研究员也常常同公社和广大群众结合起来研究改革农具。如振兴人民公社试制快碾快磨，就是全研究所的人都参加了的。在制造扬场机过程中，研究所的研究人员曾经深入各乡指导制造，并帮助郜家店人民公社试制成功高粱、大豆脱谷机，从制图到原料的供应都协助解决。研究所的研究人员还经常到群众中寻师访艺，吸取群众经验，并协助群众总结、改进农具。如足踏打稻机，一人一天只能打七十多捆，由于他们同群众商量改为水轮机带动两台打稻机，每天可以打七千捆。
    这个研究所采取的是土法上马、土洋结合、先土后洋、因地制宜的方针，同时采用了上季为下季、上半年为下半年服务的方法，因此农具改革常常走在农业生产季节的前面，改好就能用。他们推广农具的方法是采用领导、农具、技术三到田的办法，作到思想通、工具有、包教好。
