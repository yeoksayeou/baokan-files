Before I start writing, I thought about it: Why is it that the recent screening of new animated films and the animated film production exhibition have been so successful, and extraordinarily so? There is no other reason than that the animated film industry has grown rapidly and made remarkable achievements under the cultivation of the Party. Audiences have praised unanimously, and artists are especially excited.

There are a few lines in Peking Opera that go: "Peonies bloom, peonies flourish, flowers red everywhere; sunny days, good spring, a hundred birds sing." This scene is somewhat like the flourishing scene of the animated film industry. The first few lines of the lyrics describe a hundred flowers blooming, with the blooming of animated film flowers, and the flourishing of puppet and paper-cut film flowers; we can hear beautiful music and see the colorfulness. The latter lines of the lyrics symbolize that the animated film industry is bathing in the brilliance of the General Line, rippling in the advantage of the east wind, and immersed in a great spring. I think it is not unreasonable to introduce this paragraph of lyrics as the opening remark of this article, just like designing a "title" for an animated film?

Film is a comprehensive art, which also includes fine arts. Called animated films, of course, more attention is paid to fine arts. However, animated films cannot only focus on fine arts, but must also pay attention to other aspects, such as literature, drama, music, and photography. It is still necessary to conduct research, design, and production based on the nature of comprehensive art, and it is impossible to consider it solely from the perspective of fine arts. However, the art task of animated films is indeed not small. First of all, the actors in animated films must all be created from the brushes, sculptures, and scissors of artists, and most of the small animals need artists to depict a specific image required by the animated film; and at the same time as starting to draw, they must also use theatrical techniques to create characters for the actors. The first is the facial appearance, paying attention to the eyes and the kindness or evil between the eyebrows; the beauty and ugliness of the nose and mouth shapes can also influence the character. The second is to shape the shape of the whole body, roughly divided into fat, thin, long, and short, and then the character of uprightness and cunning can be expressed from the changes in the lines, plus the action, it can become a living thing. We have seen this in many animated films.

The images of the goldfish and the Grandpa Clam in the animated film "The Beautiful Little Goldfish" can remind us of such lovely little babies and old grandpas in life. When they are paired together, it means that they will do some kind things, even though it is an anxious face, it is still a very cute expression. Here, the big eyes and small red mouth of the goldfish are very important, and Grandpa Clam's sleepy eyes are always a sign of peace.

The image of the mother in "A Zhuang Brocade," although not well handled in close-up shots, is kind and amiable, full of fantasy, and the author endows the character with a desire for a better life in most of the scenes.

The images of the old couple in the puppet film "One Shoe" are both humorous and amiable, which sets off the treacherousness and wickedness of the county magistrate and the bailiffs. The depiction of the tiger image is also very successful. Its appearance further shows the shamelessness of these bad people. This is where the artists have done a very delicate job.

The fisherman boy in the paper-cut film "The Fisherman Boy" is heroic and brave. The image creation adopts the form of folk paper-cut, and the movements also imitate the fighting posture of short-coat martial arts students, which makes him look more energetic. The old fisherman is also dressed as a chivalrous man, old but energetic, with white beard and eyebrows, but black and piercing eyes, fully depicting the unyielding spirit of the old hero. The bad guy who pretends to be compassionate on the surface but is very insidious and vicious in nature—the foreign monk—has a sharp hawk nose, paired with a blood basin mouth, thick eyebrows hiding a pair of thief eyes, a hunchback and bald head, pretending to be ostentatious, and the image is very ugly. The artist's scissors are really amazing, not only cutting the image vividly, but also cutting it with clear love and hate, making the work full of educational significance.

Artists engaged in animated film work also have to do a good job, which is to draw the scenery of animated films well. In addition to the need to build small sets for puppet films, the rest rely on painting to draw the interior and exterior scenes. For example, the background of "A Zhuang Brocade" is painted very beautifully, from the verdant and secluded mountains to the shocking scene of changing winds and clouds and lightning, relying on the skillful transformation of colors, it can well conform to the development of the plot and achieve good results.

"Long Live the Great Leap Forward" uses the expressive techniques of propaganda posters to draw the background, which also achieved special effects. "The Story in the Mural" adopts the brushstrokes of peasant poetry and painting, which strengthens the color of romanticism.

The scenery painting of the paper-cut film "The Fisherman Boy" is also very successful. It uses the outlining method of painting and the mosaic method of arts and crafts, plus the knife flavor of paper-cut, forming a harmonious and integrated beautiful picture, giving people a deep impression.

In terms of set design for puppet films, it is generally better, but the angle of photography is too flat, and no more beautiful pictures are cut from various angles. At the same time, it does not consider cooperating with the movements of the puppets to achieve better artistic effects.

Another thing that artists engaged in animated film work have to do well is to make animated films have a more distinct national style. Animated film studios have made great efforts in this regard and have achieved remarkable results. We have seen many animated films and puppet films with national style; and from paper-cut films such as "Pigsy Eats Watermelon" and "The Fisherman Boy," we can see the new achievements of animated films in national style. The paper-cut film is created by absorbing the characteristics of traditional Chinese art of shadow play and paper-cut, and is welcomed by the masses. The emergence of this type of film has opened up a broad path for inheriting China's national traditions and developing animated film art.

The future of the animated film industry is as bright as brocade, and the work of artists is also promising. However, in the great leap forward, there are still some issues worth exploring: for example, the modeling of puppets has not yet gone beyond the stage of simulating nature, which requires further learning from traditional folk art. The use of Chinese painting techniques in animated films should also pay attention to the coordination of characters and backgrounds. Whether it is freehand or meticulous, it cannot be rigidly combined. To produce paper-cut films, we must also study the characteristics of shadow puppets and paper-cuts more, so that they are more refined and have better decorative effects. Do not be too bound by issues such as anatomy and perspective, but should be bolder in breaking superstitions and bringing forth new ideas.

I believe that art has no limit, and the Great Leap Forward has no limit. I wish the animated film industry another leap forward!

    试谈美术片的美术
    张光宇
    着笔之先，我想了一想：为什么这次美术电影的新片放映和美术电影制作展览会竟能如此地获得成功，而且是异乎寻常的成功呢？没有别的，只因为是在党的培育下，美术电影事业才得到迅速成长，并作出惊人的成绩来。观众们都异口同声地称赞，美术家们尤其感到兴奋。
    京剧有这样几句唱词：“芍药开，牡丹放，花红一片；艳阳天，春光好，百鸟声喧。”这景色正有点像美术电影事业的一片繁荣景象。唱词的前面几句描写着百花齐放，既有动画片之花的大开，也有木偶片和剪纸片之花的大放；既听得见美妙的音乐，也看得见色彩的缤纷。后几句唱词象征着美术电影事业正沐浴在总路线的光辉照耀下，荡漾在东风的优势中，沉浸在一片大好春光里。我认为先引这一段唱词作为本文的开场白，正如摄制美术片那样，先为它设计出一个“片头”来，我想不会是不合理的吧？
    电影是综合艺术，其中也包括美术，而称为美术电影，当然更是注重美术了。但美术电影不可能仅仅注重美术，还必须注重其它，如文学、戏剧、音乐、摄影等方面，仍需根据综合艺术的性质进行研究、设计和摄制，而不可能单从美术的角度去考虑。不过美术片的美术任务的确是不小的。首先美术片里的演员，一定是全部依靠从美术家的画笔下、雕塑刀下与剪刀下产生出来的，而且大部分的小动物，需要美术家刻划出美术片所需要的一种特定的形象；并且在动笔的同时还要运用戏剧的手法为演员创造出性格。首先是开脸，注意它的眼神以及眉宇间的善良或是邪恶；鼻形与口形的美与丑的勾法，也能左右性格。其次是塑造全身的形状，大别为肥瘦长短，然后可以从线条的变化中，表现出正直和狡猾的性格，再加上动作，就能成为有生命的东西了。我们从许多美术片中都看到了这一点。
    动画片“美丽的小金鱼”中的金鱼和蚌壳公公的形象，就可以让我们联想到生活里常有这样可爱的小宝宝和老公公。当他们配搭在一起的时候，就是说会做出一些好心肠的事情的时候，尽管是一副着急的面孔，但还是一种十分可爱的表情。这里小金鱼的大眼睛和一张小红口的表情是很重要的，而蚌壳公公的睡眼惺忪也始终是一种祥和的标志。
    “一幅僮锦”里的妈妈的形象，虽然在特写镜头上还没有处理得很好，可是她在大多数的画面里，形象是和蔼而慈祥的，富有幻想的成分，而且作者还赋予人物以对美好生活的渴求的感情。
    木偶片“一只鞋”中那对老夫妇的形象既幽默而又可亲，衬出了县官与公差的形象的奸诈和可恶。老虎形象的刻划也很成功，它一出场，更显得这些坏人的无耻，这是美术家的工作做得十分细腻的地方。
    剪纸片“渔童”里的渔童，英武勇猛，在形象创造上采用了民间剪纸的形式，动作也仿照了短靠武生打斗式的姿势，更见精神抖擞。老渔翁也作江湖好汉的打扮，年迈而精神奕奕，须眉皆白，但眼珠乌黑而炯炯有神，充分画出了老英雄不屈的神态。那个表面装做慈悲，本性却非常阴险毒辣的坏家伙——外国和尚，生就一个尖刻的鹰嘴鼻，下边配着一张血盆大口，浓眉下藏着一双贼眼，驼背秃顶，装腔作势，形象十分丑恶。美术家这把剪刀可真了不起，不但剪得形象逼真，而且剪得爱憎分明，使作品富于教育意义。
    从事美术片工作的美术家还要做好一件事，就是要画好美术片的布景。美术片布景除了木偶片还需要搭好小布景外，其余的便是依靠绘画手段来画好内外景。例如“一幅僮锦”的衬景就画得非常优美，从苍翠而清幽的山峦起伏，直画到风云变幻与雷电交作的震惊场面，依靠色调的变换有方，颇能符合剧情的发展，取得了很好的效果。
    “大跃进万岁”以宣传画的表现手法来画衬景，也取得了特殊效果。“壁画里的故事”采取农民诗画的笔意，更加强了浪漫主义的色彩。
    剪纸片“渔童”的绘景也是很成功的，运用了绘画的勾勒法和工艺美术的镶嵌法，再加上剪纸的刀味，形成了谐和的浑然一体的优美的画面，给人以深刻的印象。
    在木偶片的置景方面，一般都还比较好，但是摄影的角度太过平板，没有从各个角度去割取较美的画面，同时也没考虑到和木偶的动作相配合而达到更好的艺术效果。
    从事美术片工作的美术家再要做好一件事，便是使美术片具有更鲜明的民族风格。美术片厂在这方面已尽了很大的努力，并获得了显著的成就。我们已看到不少具有民族风格的动画片和木偶片；而从剪纸片“猪八戒吃西瓜”和“渔童”等就更可以看出美术片在民族风格上的新成就。剪纸片是吸取我国传统艺术皮影戏和剪纸的特点而创造的，受到广大群众的欢迎。这个片种的出现，为继承我国民族传统，发展美术电影艺术开拓了广阔的途径。
    美术电影事业前途如锦，美术家们的工作也大有可为，但在大踏步前进中，也还有一些问题值得我们来探讨：比如木偶的造型还没有越过模拟自然的阶段，这就需要更进一步向传统的民间艺术学习。动画片运用中国画的画法还要注意人物和背景的协调，写意的也好，工笔的也好，不能生硬结合。制作剪纸片，还得要多多研究皮影和剪纸的特点，使得更精炼，而具有更好的装饰效果，不要太为解剖和透视等问题所束缚，而应该是更大胆地破除迷信，推陈出新。
    我相信艺术无止境，跃进也无止境，祝美术片跃进再跃进！
