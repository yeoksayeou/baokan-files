They Couldn't Help But Sing
　　Qin Li

　　Recently, Shanghai held a mass amateur arts exchange performance for neighborhood residents. The performers numbered more than 250, the vast majority of whom were former housewives. Their performances included a hundred-person chorus, songs and dances, recitations, Shanghai opera, Yue opera, Pingtan storytelling, Dānxián ballad singing, and more. A city-wide arts festival held by housewives is a first for Shanghai.

　　Most of the programs in this arts exchange performance were created by the residents themselves. Some depicted the tremendous changes in the neighborhoods over the past decade, some praised the neighborhood service undertakings, some depicted the vibrant scene in the street nurseries, and many praised new people and new customs.

　　From this arts festival, people can see that if they hadn't participated in street production, if the streets hadn't established collective welfare services, they would have had few opportunities to participate in these mass cultural activities. This is because the brilliance of the Party's General Line has shone on the streets and lanes, and the Great Leap Forward has liberated them from beside the cooking stove, enabling them to participate in social production. Their lives are gradually changing, and their horizons are slowly broadening; everyone has become cheerful and radiant, and they can't help but sing and dance. Their passionate feelings of praising the Party, praising the General Line, praising the Great Leap Forward, and praising the People's Commune are extremely natural.

　　These self-composed and self-performed programs expressed their love and gratitude to the Party and depicted the changes in their lives. Therefore, these works have both genuine and moving political content, as well as a strong sense of the times and the breath of life, which is precisely the valuable aspect of mass amateur arts activities. Such performances can educate themselves, and others can also gain a lot of education from watching them.

　　Correctly carrying out amateur arts activities can promote production, educate the masses, and enrich the cultural life of the masses.

    她们情不自禁地唱了起来
    秦犁
    最近上海举办了一个里弄居民群众文艺交流演出会，演员有二百五十多人，绝大多数是过去的家庭妇女。她们演出的节目有百人大合唱，有歌舞、朗诵、沪剧、越剧、评弹、单弦等等。家庭妇女举行全市性的文艺会演，这在上海还是第一次。
    这个文艺交流演出的节目，多数是居民自己创作的。有的描绘里弄十年的巨变，有的歌唱里弄的服务事业，有的描写了街道托儿所气象，还有不少歌颂新人物新风气的。
    从这次文艺会演中，人们可以看到：如果不是她们参加了街道生产，如果不是街道办起了集体福利事业，她们是难得机会参加这些群众性的文化活动的。这是由于党的总路线的光辉照到了街道里弄，是大跃进把她们从锅台旁边解放出来，使她们能够参加了社会生产。她们的生活正在逐步变化，她们的眼界也慢慢扩大了；她们个个变得胸怀舒畅，心花怒放，就情不自禁地要歌之舞之了。她们这种热情地歌颂党，歌颂总路线，歌颂大跃进，歌颂人民公社的感情是极其自然的。
    这些自编自演的节目，表达了她们热爱党、感谢党的心情，描绘了她们生活的变化。因此这些作品既有真切感人的政治内容，也有强烈的时代感和生活气息，这正是群众业余文艺活动的可贵之处。这样的演出既可教育她们自己，别人看了也是可以得到不少教益的。
    正确地开展业余文艺活动，是可以促进生产、教育群众、丰富群众的文化生活的。
