    A surging high tide of technical innovation and technical revolution movement has emerged in the vast rural areas of Henan Province. It has not only promoted an all-round leap forward in agricultural production, but also driven the great development of industrial production, especially county and commune industries; and it has shown people a correct way to realize agricultural semi-mechanization and mechanization in a faster, better, and more economical way.
    The development of the rural technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the past few months has enabled us to find a specific path to realize agricultural mechanization. That is, while accelerating national industrialization, relying on the wisdom of the broad masses of farmers, vigorously carrying out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, proceeding from indigenous methods to foreign methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and gradually realizing the semi-mechanization and mechanization of agriculture. This is the only correct path. Only by accelerating the development of large-scale industry and vigorously carrying out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in rural areas can the great cause of agricultural technological transformation be combined with the masses of farmers in the whole province, giving full play to the power of the broad masses of farmers, giving full play to all the potential of the people's communes, launching mass movements in a big way, and gradually realizing agricultural mechanization in a faster, better, and more economical way. Only by vigorously carrying out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the vast rural areas can we, before the national large-scale industry can produce enough tractors and agricultural machinery, first improve agricultural labor productivity by realizing agricultural semi-mechanization, ensure the continuous leap forward of agricultural production, and use the continuous leap forward of agricultural production to promote the leap forward of industrial production, so that industry can provide enough technical equipment as soon as possible to arm agriculture and realize the great ideal of agricultural modernization at an early date. Conversely, if we do not mobilize and rely on the broad masses of farmers to carry out technical innovation in a big way, and simply rely on the national large-scale industry, waiting for mechanization, we will not be able to realize the continued leap forward of agricultural production, and we will delay the speed of industrial development, which will inevitably postpone the realization of mechanization. In order to further carry out the rural technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the key lies in thoroughly criticizing the indifferent attitude of looking down on "indigenous" methods and being indifferent to the creative inventions of the masses, welcoming and supporting even the smallest improvements proposed by the masses with full enthusiasm, and ensuring that leading cadres take the lead, combining leaders, technicians, and the masses, using the actions of leaders to influence the broad masses, helping the masses solve various specific difficulties, and actively leading the movement forward. It should be seen that although the creations of the masses are still incomplete, unsystematic, and very "indigenous", with the development of the movement, they will change from incomplete to complete, from unsystematic to systematic. "From low to high, from indigenous to foreign" is the inevitable trend of the development of the movement. In fact, the development of the movement is already undergoing qualitative changes. Many indigenous things are becoming foreign, and low things are becoming high.
    The emergence of the high tide of the rural technical revolution movement has become the most prominent feature of the rural situation in Henan Province in 1960. With the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the whole province, the high tide of the rural technical revolution movement will inevitably become higher and higher, and its role will inevitably become greater and greater. Party organizations at all levels should fully recognize this situation, stand at the forefront of the high tide, and actively lead this movement.

    不能坐等机械化
    一个汹涌澎湃的技术革新和技术革命运动高潮，已经在河南省广大农村出现。它不但促进了农业生产的全面跃进，也带动了工业生产、特别是县、社工业的大发展；并且向人们展示出一条多快好省地实现农业半机械化、机械化的正确途径。
    几个月来农村技术革新和技术革命运动的发展，使我们摸索到了一条实现农业机械化的具体道路。这就是在加速国家工业化的同时，依靠广大农民群众的智慧，大搞技术革新和技术革命运动，由土到洋，土洋并举，逐步实现农业的半机械化和机械化。这是一条唯一正确的道路。只有在加速发展大工业的同时，在农村大搞技术革新和技术革命运动，才能使农业技术改造的伟大事业和全省农民群众结合起来，充分发挥广大农民群众的力量，充分发挥人民公社的一切潜力，大搞群众运动，多快好省地逐步实现农业机械化。只有在广大农村大搞技术革新和技术革命运动，才能在国家大工业不能生产出足够的拖拉机和农业机械以前，首先通过实现农业的半机械化，来提高农业的劳动生产率，保证农业生产的连续跃进，并且用农业生产的连续跃进，来促进工业生产的跃进，使工业能够尽快地提供足够的技术装备来武装农业，早日实现农业现代化的伟大理想。反之，如果不去发动和依靠广大农民群众大搞技术革新，单纯依赖国家大工业，坐等机械化，就无法实现农业生产的继续跃进，就要延缓工业的发展速度，其结果，势必推迟机械化的实现。为了进一步开展农村的技术革新和技术革命运动，关键又在于彻底批判那种看不起“土”的和对待群众的创造发明漠不关心的冷淡态度，用满腔热情来欢迎和支持群众提出的那怕是极其微小的改进，并且要做到领导干部亲自动手，领导、技术人员和群众三结合，以领导的行动影响广大群众，帮助群众解决各种具体困难，积极领导运动前进。应当看到，虽然群众的创造有许多还不完整，不系统，还很“土”，但是随着运动的发展，就会由不完整到完整，由不系统到系统。“由低到高，由土到洋”是运动发展的必然趋势。实际上，运动的发展已经在起着质的变化。许多土的正在变成洋的，低的正在变成高的。
    农村技术革命运动高潮的出现，已经成为1960年河南省农村形势的最突出的特点。随着全省技术革新和技术革命运动的发展，农村技术革命运动的高潮必将越来越高，其作用也必将越来越大。各级党组织都应当充分认清这一形势，站在高潮的最前面，积极领导这一运动。
