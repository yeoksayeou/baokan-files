    Let Tools Also Be "Multi-Talented"
    During the Great Leap Forward last year, in order to improve tea roasting efficiency and save fuel, we used locally available materials and indigenous methods to imitate the principles of new-style tea roasting machines, and built a tea roasting room. This tea roasting room not only improved work efficiency, saved fuel, and reduced costs, but also greatly improved the quality of the tea. It is indeed a new type of tool worthy of widespread promotion. However, tea production is seasonal. After the tea season, it becomes "unemployed" and has to wait until the next tea season to function again. This seems "natural" and "unobjectionable" to most people. But those with Great Leap Forward thinking feel it is a pity and a waste. Since the roasting room can dry tea, why can't it be used to dry other things? Li Yue, the First Secretary of the CCP Xiapu County Committee, remembered the large amount of sweet potato chips that rotted due to bad weather during last year's sweet potato harvest, so he advocated using the tea roasting room to dry sweet potato chips. This measure achieved good results. A drying room that is two meters wide, three meters long, and more than two meters high can dry more than 2,000 catties of sweet potato chips per day and night. If a production team has one or two drying rooms, there is no need to worry about sweet potato chips rotting. The roasting room can not only dry tea and sweet potato chips, but also serve other agricultural and sideline product processing. In this way, the tea roasting room will not become "unemployed" with the end of the tea season, and it may become a hero who works tirelessly all year round.
    Although this is a small matter, it has given us great inspiration. In today's high-speed development of industrial and agricultural production and various construction undertakings, in addition to vigorously promoting technological innovation and continuously improving labor efficiency, how to make full use of existing equipment and give greater play to the role of existing equipment, so as to achieve multiple uses for one thing and keep tools working when people are resting, is also a very important thing.

### 让工具也当“多面手”

    让工具也当“多面手”
    去年大跃进时，我们为了提高烘茶效率、节约燃料，根据新式烘茶机的原理，就地取材，土法上马，仿造了一种茶叶烘焙室。这种茶叶烘焙室不但提高了工效，节省了燃料，降低了成本，还大大提高了茶叶的质量，确是一种值得普遍推广的新式工具。但茶叶生产是有季节性的，过了茶季它就要“失业”，要等到明年茶季才能发挥作用。这在一般人看来是理所“当然”的，是无可“非议”的。但有跃进思想的人就感到可惜，认为是个浪费。烘焙室可以烘干茶叶，为什么不能利用来烘干其他东西呢？中共霞浦县委第一书记李岳同志想起了去年收地瓜时因天气不好造成大量地瓜米霉烂的事，就倡议利用茶叶烘焙室来烘地瓜米。这一措施收到了良好的效果，一个二米宽、三米长、二米多高的烘干室，一昼夜可烘干地瓜米二十多担，一个生产队有一两个烘干室就不怕地瓜米霉烂了。烘焙室不但可以烘茶、烘地瓜米，还可以为其他农副产品加工服务。这样，茶叶烘焙室就不至随着茶季的结束而“失业”，有可能成为终年劳动不歇的英雄。
    这虽是一桩小事，但却给了我们很大启发。在工农业生产和各项建设事业高速度发展的今天，除了大闹技术革新不断提高劳动效率以外，如何充分利用现有设备，发挥现有设备的更大作用，做到一物数用，人歇工具不歇，也是一件很重要的事情。
