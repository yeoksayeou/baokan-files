Plains Flowers Transplanted to Mountainous Areas

The people of Qinglong County extensively construct high-yield terraced fields, ditches, and slopes, finding a new path for the high-speed development of agricultural production in mountainous areas.

Promoting advanced cultivation systems in mountainous areas requires first and foremost the heroic spirit of continuous revolution. The soil in the Gaolipu Brigade is poor and the land is fragmented, making production conditions very difficult. However, the Party organization and the broad masses of commune members here did not bow their heads in the face of difficulties. They said: "We can make the big river move and the high mountains bow their heads, so why can't we create high-yield fields!" It was because of this ambition that they were able to successfully transplant the high-yield fields – this flower of the plains – to the mountains to bear fruit.

The Gaolipu Brigade creatively applied the experience of high-yield fields from the plains. Based on the characteristics of the mountainous area, they adopted methods of planting crops according to soil quality and delineating fields according to terrain and crops when demarcating the fields and planting crops. In the management of the square fields, they skillfully applied the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, according to the characteristics of fragmented land and infertile soil. In the allocation of labor, they also adopted a combination of specialized and collaborative methods according to the dispersed residential pattern of the mountainous area. It is precisely because of this that when the experience of Gaolipu appeared, it formed a county-wide mass movement. This matter eloquently demonstrates that the high-yield fields created in the plains also possess a strong vitality in the mountainous areas.

    平原花朵　移植山区
    青龙县人民大建丰产川、沟、坡，为山区农业生产高速度发展找到了一条新的途径。
    在山区推行先进的耕作制度，首先要具有不断革命的英雄气概。高力铺大队土质贫瘠、地块零碎，生产条件很差，但是这里的党组织和广大社员没有在困难面前低头。他们说：“咱能让大河搬家，让高山低头，为什么，不能搞丰产方！”就是因为有了这样的雄心壮志，他们才能成功地把丰产方——这个平原的花朵，移植到山区结果。
    高力铺大队创造性地运用了平原地区丰产方的经验。他们根据山区特点，在划方和种植作物时，采取了因土质种作物，因地势、作物划方的方法；在方田经营上，按照地块零碎、土地瘠薄等特点，巧妙地运用了农业“八字宪法”；在劳力调配上，也按照山区居住分散的特点，采取了专业和协作相结合的办法。正因为这样，所以当高力铺的经验一出现，就形成了一个全县性的群众运动。这件事雄辩地说明了，平原地区创造的丰产方，在山区同样具有强大的生命力。
