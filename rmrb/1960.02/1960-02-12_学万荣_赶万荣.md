Learning phonetic literacy is an effective way to accelerate the speed of literacy, consolidate literacy results, and improve the cultural level of the broad masses of working people. Since last year, the Sichuan Education Department has conducted pilot work on phonetic literacy in Rong County, Zigong, Luzhou, Longchang, Fushun, and other counties and cities, and has achieved remarkable results. Practice has proven that phonetic literacy generally requires about 100 hours of teaching for students to reach the literacy standard; they can write letters, poems, and read newspapers. Some people can also read phonetic science and technology books and learn production technology knowledge. The broad masses of people warmly welcome phonetic literacy, praising it by saying: "Phonetic literacy is truly good, allowing illiterates to leap forward in literacy, learning one is as good as learning all, remembering it firmly for three to five years, able to recognize Chinese characters without a teacher, and able to write poetry with a pen."

In order to further develop phonetic literacy work, Sichuan Province plans to vigorously promote the experience of Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, and has re-arranged the pilot work: with Rong County as the focus, it will first be fully implemented in the county, and other pilot counties and cities will gradually expand the scope of experimentation on the original basis, striving to achieve results and obtain systematic experience before "May Day," and gradually promote it. At present, the county and city committees of various pilot areas have further strengthened the specific leadership of phonetic literacy work, and established and improved special management institutions. Rong County, Luzhou and other counties and cities are led by the secretaries who formed a working committee to promote phonetic literacy and popularize Mandarin. Combining with the current socialist education and various production tasks, the pilot areas are launching a mass movement to vigorously organize the masses to study. At the same time, they are actively taking the method of simultaneous action at the county, city, commune, and management area levels to train teachers in large numbers; actively compiling and supplying phonetic reading materials. Rong County, Luzhou, Fushun and other counties and cities are actively preparing phonetic newspapers and have ordered more than 200,000 copies of various phonetic reading materials.

The enthusiasm of the broad masses of people for learning is extremely high, and a mass learning upsurge of "Learning from Wanrong and Catching up with Wanrong" is being set off.

    学万荣　赶万荣
    四川省教育厅副厅长　石清玉
    注音扫盲是加快扫盲速度、巩固扫盲成果和提高广大劳动人民文化水平的有效办法。四川教育厅从去年起在荣县、自贡、泸州、隆昌、富顺等县市进行注音扫盲的试点工作，获得显著成效。实践证明，注音扫盲一般经过一百小时左右的教学，学员即可达到脱盲标准；能写书信、诗歌和阅读报纸。有的人并能阅读注音科技读物，学习生产技术知识。广大群众对注音扫盲极为欢迎，他们赞颂说：“注音扫盲真正好，文盲识字如飞跃，认一个来得一个，三年五载记得牢，无师也能识汉字，提笔就能写诗稿。”
    为了进一步开展注音扫盲工作，四川省计划大力推广山西省万荣县的经验，重新布置了试点工作：以荣县为重点，首先在该县全面开展，其他试点县市在原有基础上逐步扩大试验范围，争取在“五一”前作出成绩，取得系统经验，逐步加以推广。目前，各试点县市委已进一步加强了注音扫盲工作的具体领导，建立和健全了专管机构。荣县、泸州等县市都由书记挂帅，成立了推行注音扫盲和推广普通话工作委员会，各试点地区结合当前社会主义教育和各项生产工作，大搞群众运动，大力组织群众学习。同时积极采取县市、公社、管区三级同时动手的办法，大量训练师资；积极编写、供应注音读物，荣县、沪州、富顺等县市积极筹办拼音小报，并预订了各种注音读物二十余万册。
    广大群众学习热情极为高涨，正在掀起一个“学万荣、赶万荣”的群众学习热潮。
