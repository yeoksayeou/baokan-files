Title: Used Where It Counts

A Note

    The "Washington Post and Times Herald" recently published an editorial praising the United States for greatly increasing "aid" to some Asian countries as a "new proposal" of "many months" because it "concentrates the main part of the aid on those areas that are likely to have the most immediate effect." The newspaper called this "new proposal" "using aid where it counts."
    Is it really the case that Washington is so ignorant of the art of wielding a knife that it has been using billions of dollars every year on the back of the blade? Of course not. When the master has money, he will order plays. When the robber has a knife, he will also use it. It has long been no secret that the US dollar has been used as capital to recruit soldiers and buy horses, or as Rockefeller, the king of kerosene, said, to "fish for big fish." Now, the "new proposal" praised by this newspaper is nothing more than Washington's use of the US dollar to coordinate its diplomatic methods in Asia.
    In fact, this is the case not only in Asia, but also in Latin America. For example, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Rubottom recently demonstrated a knife technique. He warned Latin American countries that "punitive actions against foreign investment in one place may affect the entire region." United Press International said that the "one place" he was referring to was Cuba. Here, the Assistant Secretary of State's ingenious use of the US dollar is not to buy off one or two countries, but to try to win over all other Latin American countries to deal with Cuba, so that Cuba is isolated among the Latin American countries chained by the nose with US dollar chains. Isn't the set of knife skills that Rubottom is showing off worthy of a group of court writers to marvel at as a good knife?

### 用在刀口上

    用在刀口上
    “华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”最近写了一篇社论，赞扬美国大大增加对亚洲一些国家的“援助”是“许多月来”的“新主张”，因为它“把援助的主要部分集中用于那些大概能最立即发生效果的地区。”这家报纸把这个“新主张”称之为“把援助用在刀口上”。
    难道华盛顿真是那样不懂操刀之术，一直把每年几十亿美元都用在刀背上吗？当然不是这样。老爷有钱，就会点戏。强盗有刀，也会用刀。美元一直被作为招兵买马的本钱，或者像煤油大王洛克菲勒所说的“钓大鱼”的饵，这早已不是什么秘密了。现在这家报纸所赞扬的“新主张”，正不是别的，而是指的华盛顿在利用美元来配合其在亚洲的外交手法。
    其实，不仅在亚洲，在拉丁美洲也是如此。例如，美国负责美洲事务助理国务卿鲁博特姆最近就表演了一次刀法。他警告拉丁美洲国家说，“由于一个地方对外国投资采取惩罚行动，可能整个地区都要受到影响”。合众国际社说，他所指的“一个地方”是古巴。在这里，助理国务卿使用美元的妙计，不是为了收买一、两个国家，而是企图笼络所有其他拉丁美洲国家来对付古巴，使古巴在被美元锁链串着鼻子的拉丁美洲国家中陷于孤立。鲁博特姆耍的这套刀法，还不值得一群御用作家们惊叹好刀么。
