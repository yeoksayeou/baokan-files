Sesame Stalk Oil Extraction and Its Comprehensive Utilization
　　Henan Provincial Grain Bureau Scientific Research Institute

Using sesame stalks to extract oil is a major initiative by the employees of the Qiunanqu South Commune Oil Factory in Dancheng County and the Shaodian Nanshe Oil Factory in Shangcai County, Henan Province, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, to develop natural resources. It not only increases oil production for the country but, more importantly, opens up a broad avenue for solving the problem of pig feed. The Henan Provincial Party Committee has paid special attention to this innovation, promptly convened an on-site meeting, and promoted this advanced experience throughout the province. In the past two months, all parts of the province have made great achievements in sesame stalk oil extraction, producing more than 10 million jin of crude oil and more than 50 million jin of oil cake, and have further developed comprehensive utilization technologies and experiences.

　　The Basis for Sesame Stalk Oil Extraction

Sesame stalks have always been burned as firewood. Today, they are used to extract oil, as feed, and to produce other products, increasing social wealth, which is indeed a remarkable thing. This has never happened before, so some people, due to a lack of understanding of the principles involved, still have reservations.

Sesame stalks can be used to extract oil, and this has a scientific basis. Sesame is an oilseed crop with a high oil content. Its formation process, like that of other plants, is a process of photosynthesis. Because the fat—oil content—of sesame seeds is supplied and gradually accumulated through its plant body, sesame stems and leaves also contain fat. According to chemical analysis, sesame stalks contain 2.75% oil and contain combined fats and non-glyceride substances, such as phospholipids and proteins. In addition, sesame capsules contain 1%-2% of unthreshed yellow skin and good or bad sesame seeds. These substances can be pressed into oil after synthesis.

　　Operating Techniques for Sesame Stalk Oil Extraction

From the above analysis, it can be known that sesame stalks contain about 5% oil (including sesame seeds). How to extract all of these oils is an important technical issue. The wisdom of the people is infinite. The creators of sesame stalk oil extraction used the "water instead of oil" method to solve this technical problem. This method is not complicated and is basically the same as the general earthen press oil extraction method in each process. Only the selection of materials, roasting, water addition, and steaming are slightly different, requiring more attention to detail.

Generally, every 100 jin of sesame stalks can produce about fifteen to twenty-five jin of crude oil. The crude oil contains a large amount of moisture, generally 15%-20% oil content in the crude oil, and about 80%-85% moisture and other components. Therefore, the crude oil must be refined in a timely manner (preferably no more than twenty-four hours) to be suitable for food and other uses, avoiding rancidity loss. The currently used refining methods can be summarized as follows:

(1) Natural sedimentation method: Put the extracted crude oil in the sun for eight to ten hours. In cold seasons, it can be placed indoors and heated to about 30℃. After standing for four to ten hours, the oil layer floats to the top, and the oil can be taken.

(2) Heat the crude oil to 50-70℃, then add 2% salt powder, or 1% alum powder, gypsum (four taels with three jin of water solution), or an appropriate amount of alkali as a starter per 100 jin of crude oil, and let it stand for twelve hours before taking the oil. These methods are not yet fully mature and need further research.

Comprehensive Utilization of By-products After Sesame Stalk Oil Extraction

Sesame stalks are not only a good raw material for oil extraction, but also the by-products after oil extraction can be used to extract wine, sugar, and various chemical products, and are also good feed for pigs. By-products can be roughly divided into waste liquid and cake.

1.  The waste liquid after refining crude oil is a good raw material for light and chemical industries. According to chemical analysis, this waste liquid contains 4.55% sugar, 0.184% acid, 0.11% formaldehyde, 0.765% methanol, 0.00001% furfural, as well as resin and other chemical components. Although formal production is not possible due to unresolved fractionation technology and equipment, the masses have not thrown it away in vain, and have opened up new uses. For example, Dancheng, Biyang, and other places use waste liquid to make high-quality soap, ink, earthen paint, glue, soy sauce, and other products. If further research is conducted, it will surely add more material wealth to society.

2.  After sesame stalks are used for oil extraction, a large amount of cake can be produced, with each 100 jin of sesame stalks producing 160 to 170 jin of cake. Sesame stalk cake can replace refined feed and is also a good raw material for light industry. According to chemical analysis, sesame stalk cake contains the following chemical components: 3.05% ether extract, 4.92% crude protein, 3.71% total sugar, 10.06% starch, 33.2% crude fiber; each 100 grams of sample contains 1.547 grams of calcium, 0.353 grams of phosphorus, and 0.119 grams of iron. Because the ingredients are relatively complete and good, it is not only suitable for making pig feed, but also can be used to extract food. For example, Shangcai, Changge, and other counties use every 100 jin of sesame stalk cake to extract fifteen jin of 55-60 proof white wine, or ten jin of maltose. After making wine and sugar, it can also be used to make 120 jin of vinegar, and the remaining residue can be used as feed. Shangcai County conducted pig feeding experiments with sesame stalk cake. Pigs weighing more than 40 jin gained 0.12 jin per day, pigs weighing more than 70 jin gained 1 jin per day, and pigs weighing more than 100 jin gained 1.4 jin per day. The Shangcai Shaotang People's Commune, one of the creators of sesame stalk oil extraction, calculated that the economic value of making oil, wine, soy sauce, and vinegar alone is four and a half times higher than the value of every 100 jin of sesame stalks, which means that it can make a profit of 13.53 yuan. Therefore, the masses sing praises: "Sesame stalks are truly treasures, with high value for comprehensive utilization."

　　Widely Utilize Sesame Stalks and Other Oilseed Crops to Serve Socialist Construction

The above materials show that the significant economic significance of sesame stalks is undeniable. This fact raises the following question: Can the stems, leaves, and fruits of other oilseed crops be comprehensively utilized like sesame stalks? Our answer is affirmative. Based on our chemical analysis of the stems and leaves of more than 40 kinds of oilseed crops and wild plants, especially the oil extraction experiments of 135 kinds of cultivated and wild oilseed crops by the people of Henan Province, the results prove that: all oilseed crops and cereal plants with more fat content in stems, leaves, skins, shells, hearts, and fruits can be used to extract oil and can be comprehensively utilized. Therefore, vigorously engaging in the comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products and wild plants is an important way to promote the development of commune-run industries, quickly enrich social material wealth, and accelerate socialist construction. Taking Henan as an example, if all 6.7 billion jin of sesame stalks, peanut vines, soybean stalks, cotton shells, rice bran, etc., in the province are used to extract oil, it is estimated that 268 million jin of oil can be produced for the country, while increasing feed by 6 billion jin. If each pig consumes 5 jin per day, it can feed 3.3 million pigs for one year, not to mention the role of pig manure in agricultural development and further comprehensive utilization can obtain more products. Therefore, it is necessary to widely and deeply carry out the comprehensive utilization of various oilseed crops and wild plants, mainly sesame stalks, mobilize all favorable factors, and serve the high-speed advance of socialist construction in our country.

    芝麻秸榨油及其综合利用
    河南省粮食厅科学研究所
    用芝麻秸榨油，是河南省郸城县秋渠南社油厂和上蔡县邵店南社油厂职工在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，开发自然资源的一项重大创举。它不仅为国家增产油脂，更重要是为解决养猪饲料开拓了一条广阔的途径。中共河南省委特别重视这一创造，及时召开了现场会议，向全省推广了这一先进经验。两个月来，全省各地在芝麻秸榨油方面已作出了很大成绩，生产毛油一千多万斤，油饼五千多万斤，并且进一步发展了综合利用的技术和经验。
            芝麻秸榨油的根据
    历来芝麻秸是当柴禾烧掉的。今天却利用它来榨油、作饲料及生产出其它产品，增加社会财富，确实是件了不起的事情。这是过去从来没有过的，因此，也有一些人由于不了解其中的道理，还持保留态度。
    芝麻秸能够榨出油来，是有科学根据的。芝麻是一种含油量很高的油料作物，它的形成过程和其他植物一样是光合作用的过程。由于芝麻种实的脂肪质——油分是通过它的植物体供给和逐渐积累起来的，所以在芝麻茎叶中也含有脂肪。根据化验分析，芝麻秸含油2．75％，并且含有结合态脂肪及非甘脂类的物质。如磷脂、蛋白质等。此外，在芝麻蒴内含有1％—2％收打不净的黄皮及好坏芝麻粒。这些物质经过合成，就能压榨出油来。
    芝麻秸榨油的操作技术
    从上述分析中可以知道芝麻秸含油量约5％左右（包括芝麻粒在内）。如何把这些油分全部提取出来，是一个重要的技术问题。人民群众的智慧是无穷的，芝麻秸榨油的创造者采用“以水代油”的方法，解决了这个技术问题。这种方法并不复杂，和一般土榨榨油操作方法在各个工序上基本相同。只是在选料、烘炒、兑水、蒸糁等工序上稍有不同，要求更细致些。
    每百斤芝麻秸一般可出毛油十五至二十五斤左右。毛油含水分较大，一般毛油内油分为15％—20％，水分及其它成分约占80％—85％左右。因此毛油必须及时（最好不超过二十四小时）精炼，才适合于食用和其他用途，避免酸败损失。目前采用的精炼方法概括为以下几种：
    （1）自然沉淀法：把榨出的毛油放在阳光下曝晒八至十小时，天冷的季节可以放在室内，加温到30℃左右。静置四至十小时，油层上浮，即可取油。
    （2）将毛油加热到50—70℃，然后每百斤毛油加2％的盐粉，或1％的白矾粉、石膏（四两用三斤水液）或适量碱为引剂，静止沉淀十二小时以后，即可取油。这些方法还不十分成熟，需进一步研究。
              芝麻秸榨油后副产品的综合利用
    芝麻秸不仅是榨油的好原料，而且榨油后的副产品能够提取酒、糖及多种化工产品，也是养猪的好饲料。副产品大体可分为废液和饼两类。
    1、毛油精炼后的废液是良好的轻、化工业原料。根据化验分析，这种废液中含糖分4．55％，酸0．184％，甲醛0．11％，甲醇0．765％，糠醛0．00001％，还有树胶及其他化学成份。目前虽然由于分溜技术和设备没有解决，不能正式生产，但群众并没有把它白白的抛掉，而且开辟了新的用途。例如，郸城、泌阳等地，利用废液制成质量很高的肥皂、墨水、土漆、胶、酱油等产品。如果进一步研究，一定还能为社会增加更多物质财富。
    2、芝麻秸经过榨油以后，能生产大量的饼，每百斤芝麻秸可产饼一百六十至一百七十市斤。芝麻秸饼可代替精饲料，也是良好的轻工业原料。根据化验分析，芝麻秸饼含有下列化学成份：乙醚浸出物3．05％，粗蛋白4．92％，全糖3．71％，淀粉10．06％，粗纤维33．2％；每百克样品中含钙一点五四七克，磷零点三五三克，铁零点一一九克。由于成份较全较好，所以不仅适于做养猪精饲料，而且能够提取食品。例如上蔡、长葛等县，用每百斤芝麻秸饼提取五十五至六十度白酒十五斤，或饴糖十斤。在制酒和糖以后，还可作醋一百二十斤，剩下的渣滓还可作饲料。上蔡县用芝麻秸饼进行喂猪试验，四十斤以上的猪日增重零点一二斤，七十斤以上的猪日增重一斤，一百斤以上的猪日增重一点四斤。芝麻秸榨油的创造单位之一上蔡邵唐人民公社算了个账，仅制做油、酒、酱油、醋等四项的经济价值就比每百斤芝麻秸的价值提高四倍半，就是说可以盈利13．53元，因此群众歌颂说：“芝麻秸，真是宝，综合利用价值高”。
    广泛利用芝麻秸及其他油料作物为社会主义建设服务
    上述材料说明芝麻秸的重大经济意义是无可置疑的。这一事实向我们提出了这样一个问题：其他油料作物的茎、叶、果实，是否能够像芝麻秸这样进行综合利用呢？我们的回答是肯定的。根据我们对于四十多种油料作物茎、叶和野生植物的化验分析，特别是河南省人民群众对一百三十五种家生、野生油料作物的榨油试验，结果证明：一切油料作物和含脂肪较多的禾谷植物茎、叶、皮、壳、心、果实都能榨油，都能综合利用。因此，大搞农副产品、野生植物的综合利用，是促进社办工业发展，尽快地丰富社会物质财富，加速社会主义建设的一条重要途径。仅就河南而言，如果全省六十七亿斤芝麻秸、花生秧、大豆秸、棉花壳、大米糠等都用来榨油，估计可为国家增产油脂二亿六千八百万斤，同时增加饲料六十亿斤，每头猪日食量按五斤计算，可供三百三十万头猪吃一年，更不用说猪肥对农业发展的作用和进一步综合利用还能得到更多产品了。因此，必须广泛而深入的开展以芝麻秸为主的各种油料作物和野生植物的综合利用，调动一切有利因素，为我国社会主义建设的高速度前进服务。
