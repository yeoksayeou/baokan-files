    A Gift for the Children
    ——Seeing the "Fine Art Film Production Exhibition"
    Lu Yihao
    Thanks to the cooperation of the China Film Workers Association, the Chinese Artists Association, and the Shanghai Fine Art Film Studio, the "Fine Art Film Production Exhibition" is being held in the capital.
    This is a gift from the fine art film workers to the audience in the capital, especially the children. It can become a bridge of friendship, connecting fine art films and all audiences who care about and love them, helping fine art films to bloom more beautifully.
    This exhibition displays the "actors" and "stage" of fine art films, and introduces the film shooting and production process. Through charts, pictures, models, and real objects, it vividly and interestingly displays the secrets of fine art films, allowing the audience to understand the hard work and achievements of the fine art film workers.
    As a beautiful flower in the new China's film industry, fine art film was cultivated by the Party. More than 30 years ago, although China had animation films, they were interrupted seven or eight years before liberation due to heavy oppression. However, under the leadership of the Party, in 1948, even though the Huaihai Campaign was still going on fiercely, the animation film "Catching the Turtle in a Jar" and China's first jointed puppet film "The Emperor's Dream" were produced. These were both political satires that powerfully struck the reactionaries.
    In the twelve years since, the new China's fine art films have greatly developed under the care of the Party. The Shanghai Fine Art Film Studio has grown from nothing, from small to large; from a few people to 300 employees; from a dilapidated small workshop to a 6,000 square meter factory building; from a drawing board as an animation stand to fairly complete equipment; from a fine art film team to an independent enterprise film studio. Over the years, with the help of all sides and the efforts of the employees, the quality of the films has gradually improved. Before the Great Leap Forward, some good films were produced, such as the animation films "Good Friends", "The Proud General", "Why is the Crow Black", and the puppet films "Magic Brush", "A New Soccer Ball", etc. In the handling of themes, the modeling of characters, the use of colors, and the exploration of styles, each had different characteristics and were welcomed by audiences at home and abroad. However, the themes and styles were not diverse enough, and creative attempts were still few.
    Since the Great Leap Forward, the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction has given fine art film workers great encouragement, and promoted the spirit of daring to think and daring to do, making the creative situation completely new. There were films praising the Great Leap Forward such as "Long Live the Great Leap Forward" and "Catching Up with England"; reflecting the leap forward in industry and agriculture such as "Wonderful Colors", "Stories in Murals", "Celebrating the Harvest"; depicting modern children's lives such as "Little Agronomists", "Red Signals"; fairy tales reflecting the spirit of the leap forward such as "Little Carp Jumps Over the Dragon Gate", "The Cuckoo Called Late"; exposing and satirizing the evils of capitalist society such as "Who Sings the Best", "Pigeon", "Lobster"; as well as folk tales, legends, fables, fairy tales, musical dance films, and documentaries. These films have achieved further development and improvement in reflecting current political life and in the exploration of national style.
    It is particularly gratifying that a new film type - the paper-cut film - was created. It absorbs the rich and colorful folk arts of shadow puppetry and paper-cuts, which have a long history in our country, and combines them with film techniques to create a unique type of film to our country. It is also a product of the Great Leap Forward. Last year, the Fine Art Film Studio produced seven films with a production team of nine people: "Fisherman Boy," "Ji Gong Fights Crickets," and "Monkey and Turtle Divide the Tree."
    In the two years of the Great Leap Forward, the output of fine art films was nearly twice the total of the previous ten years, and the cost was reduced by half, and the production time was greatly shortened. For the needs of the subject matter, even large-scale films with huge workloads were dared to be put into production. For example, the animation film "A Zhuang Brocade", in the exhibition, is a six-part film with good quality.
    These glorious achievements were all made under the leadership of the Party. In the great era of socialist construction, fine art films have an important task. In order to better educate the vast number of children, it is necessary to create more and better fine art films.

### 给孩子们的礼物——看“美术电影制作展览会”

    给孩子们的礼物
    ——看“美术电影制作展览会”
    卢怡浩
    感谢中国电影工作者联谊会、中国美术家协会和上海美术电影制片厂的合作，在首都举行了“美术电影制作展览会”。
    这是美术电影工作者献给首都的观众、特别是孩子们的礼物。它可以成为一座友谊的桥梁，使美术片和一切关心和爱好美术电影的观众们结成亲密的朋友，帮助美术电影开出更美丽的红花。
    这个展览会陈列了美术片的“演员”和“舞台”，介绍电影拍摄制作过程。通过图表、画片、模型、实物，生动而有趣地展示了美术电影的秘密，使观众们能了解到美术电影工作者的辛勤劳动和取得的成就。
    美术电影作为新中国电影事业的一朵鲜花，是党一手培植出来的。三十多年前，中国虽然也有过动画片，但由于受到重重压迫，早在解放前七、八个年头就中断了。然而，在党的领导下，1948年间，尽管淮海战役还激烈进行着，就制作了动画片“瓮中捉鳖”和中国第一部拍摄的关节木偶片“皇帝梦”，这都是政治讽刺题材，曾有力地打击了反动派。
    十二年来，新中国的美术电影在党的抚育下，已有了巨大的发展。上海美术电影制片厂就是从无到有，从小到大。从几个人到三百个职工；从一间破陋的小工作室到六千平方米的厂房；从一块板当作动画台到具有相当完善的设备；从美术片组到一个独立企业的制片厂。这些年来，在各方面的帮助和职工们的努力下，片子质量逐步提高。大跃进前，也曾制作过一些好片子，如动画片“好朋友”、“骄傲的将军”、“乌鸦为什么是黑的”，木偶片“神笔”、“一个新足球”等等。在主题的处理，人物的造型，色彩的运用，风格的摸索，都有着不同的特色。受到国内外的观众欢迎。可是，题材样式还不够多种多样，创造性的尝试还是很少的。
    大跃进以来，党的社会主义建设总路线给予美术电影工作者以巨大的鼓舞，发扬了敢想敢做的精神，使创作局面焕然一新。有歌颂大跃进的“大跃进万岁”，“赶英国”；反映工农业跃进的“美妙的颜色”、“壁画里的故事”、“庆丰收”；表现现代儿童生活的“小农艺家”、“红色的讯号”；反映跃进的精神面貌的童话“小鲤鱼跳龙门”、“布谷鸟叫迟了”；揭露和讽刺资本主义社会的罪恶的“谁唱的最好”、“鸽子”、“龙虾”；还有民间故事、传说、寓言、童话以及音乐舞蹈片，纪录片等。这些影片在反映当前政治生活方面，在民族风格的探索上，也获得进一步的发展和提高。
    特别值得高兴的，是创制了新片种——剪纸片。它是吸收了祖国的历史悠久的丰富多彩的皮影戏和窗花的民间艺术，结合电影技法，创制而成。是我国所特有的。它也是大跃进的产物。美术制片厂去年以九个工作人员的摄制组，就生产了七本片子：“渔童”、“济公斗蟋蟀”、“猴龟分树”。
    大跃进的两年，美术片的产量几及前十年总和的两倍，而且成本降低一半，制作时间大大缩短。为了题材的需要，哪怕是工作量庞大的长片，也敢于投入生产，例如展览会中的动画片“一幅僮锦”就是长达六本的而质量较好的片子。
    这些光辉的成就，都是在党领导下取得的，在伟大的社会主义建设年代里，美术电影负有重大的任务，为了更好地教育广大的儿童，还需要创作出更多更好的美术片。
