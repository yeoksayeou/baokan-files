	"Soaring to the Sky in One Step" and "Ascending to the Sky Step by Step"

	The People's Daily once reported the news that Comrade Wei Gaohou completed a year's worth of work in one day on New Year's Day. Opening the newspaper, one can see encouraging reports similar to that of Comrade Wei Gaohou every day. Reading these reports, I was reminded of a thought-provoking remark made by a leading comrade: "Technological revolution is endless, we must have the ambition to soar to the sky in one step, and also do meticulous work to ascend to the sky step by step according to different conditions." The reason why Comrade Wei Gaohou achieved such amazing results is that he "had made up his mind early to complete a year's workload on the first day of this year." This shows that he had the ambition to "soar to the sky in one step" beforehand. However, if he only had this ambition and did not have the meticulous work of the twelve major technical innovation proposals, then his idea would not have been realized.

	The development of the universe is endless. As the saying goes, "There is a heaven beyond the heavens." After we engage in technological innovation and ascend to one level of heaven, we often find that there are still more "heavens" to ascend. Technological revolution is not an easy task, but difficulty and ease are relative, they are people's feelings about two opposite sides of the same thing. Whether it is difficult or easy depends first on whether we have the ambition to overcome difficulties, and then on whether we abide by the objective laws of the development of things and make meticulous plans to overcome difficulties according to different conditions. Chairman Mao taught us that we should despise the enemy strategically and value the enemy tactically. We should also adopt this attitude in breaking through production bottlenecks.

	In order to accelerate the socialist construction of our motherland more quickly, each of us should, like Comrade Wei Gaohou, set up the ambitious goal of "soaring to the sky in one step," and at the same time, do the meticulous work of "ascending to the sky step by step" in a down-to-earth manner, and strive to be a pace-setter running ahead of time!

### “一步登天”和“步步登天”

    “一步登天”和“步步登天”
    人民日报曾经报道过魏高厚同志元旦一天干完一年工作量的消息。翻开报纸，天天都可以看见类似魏高厚同志那样令人鼓舞的报道。看了这些报道，使我联想到一位领导同志说过的一句发人深思的话：“技术革命永无止境，要有一步登天的雄心，又要根据不同条件作步步登天的细致工作。”魏高厚同志之所以取得那样惊人的成绩，原来他“早打定了主意，要在今年头一天干完一年的工作量。”这正说明他事先就有“一步登天”的雄心。可是，假使他光有这颗雄心，而没有那十二项重大技术革新建议的细致工作，那么他的主意还是不可能实现的。
    宇宙事物的发展，原是永无止境的。俗话说“天外有天”，在我们大搞技术革新登上一重天后，往往发现还有“天”可登。技术革命不是一件容易的事，但困难与容易是相对的，是人们对同一事物的两个对立面的感受。究竟是难是易，首先要看我们是否有克服困难的雄心，然后还要看我们是否遵守事物发展的客观规律，根据不同条件作了克服困难的细致打算。毛主席教导我们在战略上应该藐视敌人，在战术上应该重视敌人。我们在突破生产关键上也应采取这种态度。
    为了更快地加速祖国的社会主义建设事业，我们每个人都应该像魏高厚同志那样，立下“一步登天”的雄心大志，同时踏踏实实地作“步步登天”的细致工作，力争作一个跑在时间前面的标兵！
