Xinhua News Agency, 9th: In the past month, the distribution of rainfall and snowfall across the country has been uneven. Some areas in the Northwest, North China, and Southwest China have experienced less rainfall, and some places are experiencing drought. These areas have already taken measures to combat the spring drought.

In January, rainfall in the southern part of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River was higher than in the same period in previous years. In some areas such as northern Xinjiang, northern Hebei, eastern and southern Yunnan, northeastern Hainan Island, and the Xing'an Mountains in the Northeast, precipitation was also higher than usual. In addition, precipitation in many parts of the country in January was lower than usual. The middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River basin, the Songnen Plain, and western Liaoning Province, etc., had basically no rain or snow in January.

At present, the drought-affected area in Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Henan provinces is relatively large. Drought symptoms have appeared in some areas of Gansu, Qinghai, Hebei, Guizhou, Yunnan, Shandong, and other provinces. Some areas have not only had little or no rain or snow in January, but have also lacked rain and snow since last winter. The drought in Shaanxi is severe. In the past hundred days, the rainfall in northern Shaanxi has only been five to nine millimeters, Guanzhong has only four to ten millimeters, and southern Shaanxi has only nineteen to twenty-nine millimeters. Many of the province's ponds and cellars have dried up, and river flow has also been greatly reduced. Although there has been some rain and snow in Henan Province, the amount is small, and the evaporation rate is high due to the higher temperature than in previous years, so the soil moisture is also poor, and the water storage capacity of reservoirs is not large, and the flow of the Yellow River is also smaller than in previous years. The rainfall in Xining, Qinghai, in the past eighty days or so, has only been three millimeters. In addition, the drought situation is still developing in some areas of the coastal areas east of the Pearl River Estuary in Guangdong Province and in some areas of Leinan County in Zhanjiang Prefecture in the west. The above-mentioned areas are mobilizing the masses to fight drought and conserve soil moisture. The broad masses in the Northwest provinces and Shanxi Province are moving ice to store water. Gansu Province has made great achievements in building water conservancy projects on the one hand and moving ice and snow on the other since last winter. Under the encouragement of combat slogans such as "Eliminate drought before wheat turns green and before spring plowing," the people of Shaanxi and Henan provinces are rushing to irrigate wheat with returning green water and irrigate spring blank land. At the same time, people's communes are being mobilized to sink wells to combat drought. Southern regions are also mobilizing the masses to pay attention to water storage and conservation to ensure sufficient water for spring planting.

### 西北、华北、西南部分地区  雨雪偏少　春旱露头

    西北、华北、西南部分地区
    雨雪偏少　春旱露头
    新华社9日讯　一个多月来，全国雨量、雪量分布不均，西北、华北、西南的部分地区雨量偏少，有的地方有干旱现象。这些地区已经采取措施抗御春旱。
    1月份，长江中下游南部地区雨量比往年同期多。新疆北部、河北北部、云南东部、南部、海南岛东北部以及东北的兴安岭等局部地区，降水量也多于常年。此外，全国许多地区，1月份降水量都比常年少。黄河流域中上游地区、松嫩平原和辽西等地，1月份基本没有雨雪。
    目前，陕西、山西、河南三省受旱面积较广。甘肃、青海、河北、贵州、云南、山东等省的部分地区，旱象已露头。有些地区不仅1月份雨雪稀少或者没有下雨下雪，甚至从去冬以来一直缺少雨雪。陕西干旱严重，近一百天以来，陕北的雨量只有五毫米到九毫米，关中只有四毫米到十毫米，陕南只有十九毫米到二十九毫米。全省水塘、水窖干了很多，河流流量也大为减少。河南省虽然下了一些雨雪，但由于量小、气温比往年高蒸发量大，所以土壤水分也差，坝塘蓄水量都不多，黄河流量也比往年小。青海西宁近八十多天的雨量只有三毫米。此外，广东省珠江口以东沿海地区和西部湛江专区雷南等县的部分地区，旱情仍在发展。上述各地都在发动群众抗旱、保墒。西北各省和山西省广大群众都在搬冰蓄水。甘肃省去冬以来一面兴修水利，一面搬冰积雪，成绩很大。陕西、河南省人民在“把干旱消灭在小麦返青前、春耕前”等战斗口号鼓舞下，正突击为小麦浇返青水和灌溉春白地，同时还发动人民公社突击打井抗旱。南方地区也在发动群众注意蓄水、保水，以保证春播时有足够用水。
