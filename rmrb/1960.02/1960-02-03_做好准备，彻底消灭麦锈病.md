Get Prepared, Thoroughly Eliminate Wheat Rust
Commentator of this newspaper

    This year's wheat was sown early and managed carefully. In the northern wheat areas, high-yield plots have basically achieved garden-like cultivation, and the wheat seedlings are growing vigorously. The wheat growth situation in the southern wheat areas is also satisfactory. The masses praise it: "Clear rivers, blue skies, green wheat seedlings, stretching as far as the eye can see." Since the beginning of winter, widespread rain and snow have fallen across the country, which is very beneficial to wheat growth. However, to truly reap the fruits of a bumper wheat harvest, more effort must be put into the field management stage. Protecting wheat from rust is one of the keys to striving for a large wheat harvest. In China's wheat-producing areas, rust disease occurs to varying degrees every year. If it is not thoroughly controlled, it will cause varying degrees of yield reduction. The recent National Plant Protection Work Conference held by the Ministry of Agriculture decided to launch a wheat protection campaign nationwide to seize a large wheat harvest. This is a timely and correct call.

    Since last winter, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, members of people's communes have carried out a struggle to eliminate overwintering rust spores on tens of millions of mu of wheat fields with the heroic spirit of eliminating enemies and the fearless spirit of despising all difficulties. They have eliminated a large number of overwintering bacteria and achieved great results, laying a good foundation for rust prevention and wheat protection this spring. Last year, provinces such as Shaanxi and Gansu, based on the characteristics of wheat stripe rust overwintering on winter wheat seedlings and easily spreading in the spring, adopted the method of "eliminating the source of bacteria and guarding the three passes," controlling the damage of rust and greatly increasing wheat production. In the struggle to prevent and eliminate rust, the broad masses of people have also created many effective native and foreign pesticides and control methods, such as using ammonium sulfate water, raw urine water, and other bactericides to eliminate the bases for rust transmission, which not only eliminated the source of bacteria but also increased the application of fertilizer, achieving two goals with one move.

    Currently, winter wheat in the south is beginning to grow vigorously, and winter wheat in the north will return to green in about a month. Small groups of overwintering bacteria that have slipped through the net will still become rampant and spread as the temperature rises, and a fierce battle to eliminate rust is about to begin. We must maintain high vigilance, act early, race against time, and make all preparations in a combat posture.

    In this year's rust elimination campaign, dozens of aircraft will be dispatched across the country, dividing war zones, coordinating land and air, and carrying out a wheat protection campaign with rust elimination as the key. The fundamental guarantee for winning this battle lies in putting politics in command and launching a vigorous mass movement. Last winter, the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee and Provincial People's Committee grasped the rust elimination work tightly, highlighting it prominently, proposing to focus on the four key areas of "water, fertilizer, pigs, and rust" in the winter, establishing rust elimination organizations at all levels, and having rust elimination professional teams in every commune and team. They trained four million technicians through various methods. In the rust elimination battle, the Provincial Party Secretary and Governor personally directed the work. Through large-scale inspections, evaluations, and joint prevention, they promoted each other, and as a result, the broad masses of people were in high spirits and finally completely eliminated rust on more than five million mu. This example fully illustrates that: putting politics in command, establishing rust elimination organizations at all levels, strengthening technical training, achieving "leaders at every level, generals in every direction, soldiers in every block, and everyone taking action," carrying out large-scale inspections and evaluations, and engaging in large-scale joint prevention will mobilize all positive factors, creating an inescapable net for rust, and rust will have no chance to take advantage of.

    Fully preparing medicines and machinery is the material foundation for overcoming wheat rust. According to surveys in several important provinces, the number of sprayers is still insufficient, and many of the existing sprayers are damaged. The solution to this problem is to rely on the masses, carry out large-scale technological innovation, actively create and improve existing drug application tools according to the principle of combining native and foreign methods, and improve work efficiency. At the same time, seize the opportunity to organize the production and repair of existing tools to ensure that "everyone is on the field and everyone has machinery." At the same time, it is also necessary to seize the preparation of sulfur and various native and foreign medicines, implement plans, prepare sufficient medicines, store them in appropriate locations, and supply them in a timely manner, ensuring that "there are medicines when needed, the quantity is sufficient, and the quality is good."

    One of the characteristics of rust is that it can spread with the airflow, the bacteria multiply quickly, and it spreads rapidly. Under suitable environmental conditions, it can become prevalent within a few days. Therefore, in the rust elimination battle, it is necessary to grasp it early and act early, eliminating it before it spreads. To this end, we should carry out mass prediction and forecasting, frequently analyze the occurrence and development of diseases, conduct universal investigation and treatment, organize joint prevention and collaboration, and carry out a comprehensive encirclement and suppression, achieving fierce attacks and clever strikes; and grasp it deeply, thoroughly, and to the end, ensuring that "not a single leaf is missed, not a single plant is left behind." In general, it is necessary to grasp the four key points of "ruthless, early, clever, and comprehensive," that is: be ruthless in determination, act early, attack fiercely and cleverly, and carry out a comprehensive encirclement and suppression, strive for complete victory, and achieve labor-saving, medicine-saving, and high efficiency.

    This year is a year of continued leap forward in agricultural production in our country. Under the principle of taking grain as the key link, comprehensively arranging, and developing diversified operations, guaranteeing a large harvest of summer grain crops, especially striving for a larger wheat harvest, is of decisive significance. Therefore, we must immediately take action, make all preparations for rust prevention, and achieve "elite troops, good guns, and sufficient ammunition," be on high alert, conduct detailed investigations and universal surveys before wheat returns to green, and carry out a comprehensive encirclement and suppression as soon as rust appears, giving it a head-on blow. Leading organs in various regions must grasp the rust elimination work from beginning to end, eliminate wheat rust, and vow to seize a bumper wheat harvest!

    做好准备，彻底消灭麦锈病
    本报评论员
    今年的小麦播种早，管理细，北方麦区丰产方基本上实现了园田化，麦苗生长茁壮。南方麦区小麦生长情况也令人满意，群众赞美说：“清清的河水，蓝蓝的天，绿油油的麦苗，望不到边。”入冬以来大江南北雨雪普降，对小麦生长很有利。但是，要把小麦丰收硕果真正拿到手，还得在田间管理阶段多下功夫。保护小麦渡过锈病关，就是争取小麦大丰收的关键之一。我国产麦地区，每年都有不同程度的锈病发生，如不彻底防治，就会造成轻重不同的减产。最近农业部召开的全国植物保护工作会议决定，在全国范围内开展护麦战役，夺取小麦大丰收。这是一个适时的正确号召。
    去冬以来，各地人民公社的社员们在各级党委的领导下，以消灭敌人的英雄气概和藐视一切困难的无畏精神，在数千万亩麦田上进行了消灭越冬锈病菌源的斗争，大量歼灭了越冬病菌，取得了很大的成绩，为今春防锈保麦打下了良好基础。去年陕西、甘肃等省根据小麦条锈病在冬小麦苗上越冬、春季容易扩大流行的特点，采取“灭菌源，守三关”的办法，控制了锈病的为害，使小麦产量大大增加。广大群众在防锈灭锈斗争中，还创造了许多有效的土洋药剂和防治办法，如用硫酸铵水、生尿水等杀伤剂消灭锈病的传病基地，既消灭了菌源，又增施了肥料，一举两得。
    当前南方冬小麦开始蓬勃生长，北方冬小麦再有一个月左右时间，就要返青了。小股漏网的越冬病菌，仍会随气温上升而猖獗蔓延，一场激烈的灭锈斗争即将开始。我们必须保持高度警惕，及早动手，分秒必争，以战斗姿态作好各项准备工作。
    在今年的灭锈斗争中，在全国范围内将出动数十架飞机，划分战区，陆空配合，开展以灭锈为纲的护麦战役。打好这一仗的根本保证在于政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。去冬陕西省委、省人委灭锈工作抓的紧，摆的突出，提出冬季大抓“水、肥、猪、锈”四个字，层层建立灭锈组织，社社队队有灭锈专业队，通过各种方式训练了四百万技术人员。在灭锈战斗中，省委书记、省长亲自指挥。并通过大检查，大评比，大搞联防，互相推动，因而广大群众斗志昂扬，终于彻底歼灭了五百多万亩的锈病。这个事例充分说明：政治挂帅，层层建立灭锈组织，加强技术训练，做到“层层有帅、方方有将、块块有兵、人人动手”，开展大检查、大评比，大搞联防，调动一切积极因素，给锈病布下天罗地网，锈病就决无可乘之机。
    充分做好药械准备，是战胜小麦锈病的物质基础。根据几个重要省的调查，目前喷雾器的数量还不足，而且现有的喷雾器损坏的也不少。解决这个问题的办法，就是依靠群众，大搞技术革新，根据土洋并举的原则，积极创造和改良现有施药工具，提高工效，并且抓紧时机，组织生产和检修现有工具，保证做到“人人上阵，个个有械”。同时，还要抓紧硫磺和各种土洋药剂的准备，计划要落实，药剂要准备充足，存放地点要适当，供应要及时，保证做到“要药有药，数量足，质量好。”
    锈病的特点之一是能随气流传播，病菌繁殖很快，蔓延迅速，在适宜的环境条件下，几天之内就能普遍流行。因此，在灭锈战斗中，必须早抓、早动手，不等蔓延，就把它消灭。为此，应当开展群众性的预测预报，经常分析病害发生、发展情况，普查普治，组织联防协作，全面围剿，做到猛攻巧打；并且抓深、抓透、抓到底，保证“一叶不漏，一株不留”。总起来说，就是要抓住“狠、早、巧、全”四个字，即：狠下决心、及早动手、猛攻巧打、全面围剿，力争全胜，做到省工、省药、效率高。
    今年是我国农业生产继续跃进的一年，在以粮为纲、全面安排、发展多种经营的原则下，保证夏季粮食作物大丰收，特别是争取小麦更大丰收，具有决定性意义。因此，我们必须立即行动起来，做好防锈的一切准备工作，做到“兵精、枪好、弹足”，严阵以待，不等小麦返青，就进行细查普查，锈病刚一露头，就全面围剿，迎头痛击。各地领导机关一定要把灭锈工作自始至终抓到底，消灭麦锈病，誓夺小麦大丰收！
