    Harrowing, Topdressing, Watering
    Jinan Prefecture Fights Drought to Protect Seedlings
    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Dispatch: The broad masses of people in Jinan Prefecture, Shanxi Province, are launching a drought resistance and seedling protection campaign centered on harrowing, topdressing, and watering, determined to eliminate the spring drought before the wheat turns green. Due to scarce rain and snow last winter, the 9,620,000 mu of wheat in the Jinan area generally showed signs of drought. The dry soil layer is generally more than 1.5 cun, and the most severely affected 700,000 mu of wheat fields have a dry soil layer of 2.5 to 3 cun. Some wheat seedlings show signs of withering due to drought.
    Based on this situation, the Jinan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China summarized the experience of overcoming spring drought and obtaining bumper wheat harvests in previous years, and immediately instructed all localities to launch a field management campaign centered on "two attacks" (attacking water, attacking fertilizer), "four defenses" (defending against spring drought, defending against diseases and insects, defending against frost, defending against lodging), and "six earlies" (early watering for greening, early application of greening fertilizer, early harrowing and pressing, early eradication of rust, early weeding, early frost prevention) through inspection and sorting, and mobilizing the masses throughout the area to fight the battle to protect wheat seedlings when they turn green. In this campaign, more than 600,000 laborers were mobilized throughout the region, professional teams were established and improved, and a production responsibility system was implemented that included assigning leaders, labor, tasks, measures, and regular inspections and evaluations. At the same time, various advanced experiences were promoted. Currently, harrowing has been carried out on more than 9.6 million mu of wheat fields throughout the region, topdressing has been applied to 6.73 million mu, and watering has been carried out on 1.67 million mu. At present, the drought resistance and seedling protection campaign centered on harrowing, topdressing, and watering in this prefecture is still unfolding in depth.

    耙磨·追肥·浇水
    晋南专区抗旱保苗
    据新华社太原电　山西省晋南专区的广大人民，正在开展以耙磨、追肥、浇水为中心的抗旱保苗运动，决心把春旱消灭在小麦返青以前。晋南地区九百六十二万亩小麦由于去冬雨雪稀少，普遍呈现旱象。一般干土层均在一寸五以上，最严重的七十万亩麦田干土层达二寸五到三寸以上；部分麦苗因干旱呈现枯萎现象。
    中共晋南地委根据这一情况，总结了历年战胜春旱获得小麦丰产的经验，并且立即指示各地通过检查排队，发动群众在全区范围内掀起了一个以“两攻”（攻水、攻肥）、“四防”（防春旱、防病虫、防霜冻、防倒伏）、“六早”（早浇返青水、早施返青肥、早耙磨镇压、早灭锈病、早除草、早防冻）为中心的大战小麦返青关的田间管理运动。在这一运动中，全区共出动了六十多万个劳力，建立和健全了专业队，实行了定领导、定劳力、定任务、定措施、定期检查评比等生产责任制，同时推广了各种先进经验。现在全区九百六十余万亩麦田，已普遍进行了耙磨，有六百七十三万亩追了返青肥，一百六十七万亩麦田浇了返青水。目前，这个专区以耙磨、追肥、浇水为中心的抗旱保苗运动，还在深入展开中。
