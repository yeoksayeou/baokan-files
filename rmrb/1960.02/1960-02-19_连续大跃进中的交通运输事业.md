    The Transportation Industry Strides Forward and Sings Triumphant Songs in a Year of Continuous Great Leap Forward
    Minister of Transportation Wang Shoudao

    1959 was a year in which the people of our country, following the Party's general line for socialist construction and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, strode forward and sang triumphant songs. We warmly celebrated the victory of the general line, the victory of the Great Leap Forward, and the victory of the people's communes. The main targets set by our country's Second Five-Year Plan have been fulfilled three years ahead of schedule. Over the past year, with the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, the transportation industry has continued to leap forward on the basis of the extraordinary leap forward in 1958, and the face of transportation has undergone dramatic changes. At the end of 1952, the country had only over 120,000 kilometers of highways, and one-third of the counties were not accessible by cars; now the national highway mileage has reached more than 480,000 kilometers, basically forming a national highway network. The navigable waterways in the country in 1952 were only over 90,000 kilometers, which increased to 160,000 kilometers last year, of which the waterways navigable by ships increased from 20,000 kilometers to 40,000 kilometers, and the river network navigable mileage reached more than 40,000 kilometers. Compared with 1952, highway mileage increased by 280%, waterway mileage increased by 68%, and various means of transportation also increased significantly. For thousands of years, the habit of "boats in the south and carts in the north" has undergone profound changes. Now, except for Qinghai, the water transport industry in all provinces and regions in the country has new developments. Some provinces and regions that had no water transport in the past now have navigable waterways, and have developed many motorized ships. The motorization and towing of wooden sailing ships, which have been left over for thousands of years, is being gradually realized. Some areas have formed a well-developed water transport network. Many areas in the south have realized cart transportation, and in the north, white sails are displayed everywhere on large and small rivers. Some special districts and counties have also opened local civil aviation routes.
    The continued Great Leap Forward in transportation in 1959 was formed by carrying out large-scale mass short-distance transportation campaigns and transportation construction campaigns, as well as carrying out a mass production increase and economy campaign centered on technological innovation and technological revolution in transportation enterprises and institutions. This is a great victory for the transportation sector under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, holding high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, under the guidance of the theory of continuous revolution, resolutely implementing the Party's general line for building socialism and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, and a great victory for the mass movement.
    Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council jointly issued instructions on carrying out a mass short-distance transportation campaign last year, a magnificent mass short-distance transportation campaign has immediately formed throughout the country. The transportation organizations at the grassroots level in the vast rural areas have gained unprecedented development. Among the more than 25,000 people's communes in the country, more than 50,000 professional transportation teams and more than 70,000 sideline transportation teams have been established. In order to strengthen the leadership of professional and sideline transportation teams, people's communes in various places have universally established transportation stations, equipped with full-time cadres, and improved various management systems to ensure organizationally and institutionally that the professional and sideline transportation teams of the people's communes gradually embarked on a stage of consolidation and improvement, thereby completing more transportation tasks with less labor.
    In the mass short-distance transportation campaign, the vast rural areas, based on the principle of taking materials locally and adapting to local conditions, vigorously carried out transportation construction, and universally promoted the "one network and five transformations" experience of Jiangbei County, Sichuan Province. In the plains and relatively flat areas, they vigorously promoted cart and rail transportation; in places where rivers were available, they actively improved rivers and vigorously promoted ship transportation; in mountainous, hilly areas and places with slopes that could be utilized, they vigorously promoted cableway and chute transportation; and these "five transformations" formed a well-developed short-distance transportation network. At the same time, the masses in various places also created many excellent types of vehicles, improved axles and wheels, and realized multi-wheelization, giving full play to the traction of power and animal power. Not only has the train-like automobile transportation been promoted more widely, but wooden sailing ships have also been more widely improved in their design, installed with small power engines, and motorized and towed; in the north, horse-drawn trains are being promoted, and some provinces in the south are promoting ox-drawn trains, and the provinces and regions in the northwest are promoting camel-drawn trains. All of these have greatly improved the transportation efficiency of existing transportation equipment. Now, towing transportation, whether on land or water, whether in modern means of transportation or folk means of transportation, is the direction of technological innovation and technological revolution.
    The labor competition in transportation enterprises in 1959 has also been further developed. In water transport, a "six comparisons" red flag competition campaign centered on accelerating ship turnover was launched to compare high output, high quality, low consumption, safety, cooperation, and technological innovation. It was required that the monthly output of river tugboats should be 15,000 ton-kilometers per horsepower, the monthly output of sea freighters should be 5,000 ton-kilometers per ton, and the monthly output of wooden sailing ships should be 1,000 ton-kilometers per ton. In automobile transportation, a campaign of "safety, economy, and 10,000 ton-kilometers per ton per month" was launched; in civil aviation transportation, a "six goods" red flag competition for safe production was launched (good safety guarantee, good increase in production and economy, good service quality, good technological innovation and technological revolution, good political ideology, and good implementation of red and expert plans); thus, the transportation efficiency of ships and automobiles has increased nearly doubled compared with 1958, making one ship and one car play the transportation role of two ships and two cars. The monthly production level of civil aviation has also increased by 50% compared with 1958.
    The outstanding achievement of the national transportation sector in enterprise management in 1959 was the promotion of the experience of the "one-dragon" transportation and large-scale cooperation between production, transportation and sales. In the process of promoting the experience of transportation and large-scale cooperation in various places, this successful experience has been continuously developed and enriched. With the development of "one-dragon" transportation, the cooperative relationship between transportation departments in various places and between production, transportation and sales departments is also developing, and new, higher and more perfect forms of cooperation are constantly emerging. This improvement in production relations has greatly liberated the potential of transportation production, enabling transportation work to exert great material strength and better serve the continued leap forward of industrial and agricultural production.
    In 1959, self-provided freight vehicles of national organs, enterprises, schools, and organizations actively participated in planned transportation on the premise of giving priority to completing the transportation tasks of their own units; the logistics troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army also dispatched a large number of vehicles to assist transportation departments in various places to complete many urgent transportation tasks.
    With the rapid development of the transportation industry, great achievements have been made in transportation science and technology work and the training of transportation cadres.
    In short, in 1959, transportation, like other departments of the national economy, achieved brilliant achievements and completed the tasks put forward by the Great Leap Forward of the national economy to the transportation sector.

        A New Stage in the Development of the Transportation Industry
    The cadres and workers in the transportation sector deeply realize that rightist tendencies must be thoroughly opposed, enthusiasm must be boosted, the red flag of the general line of socialist construction must be held high, and mass movements must be carried out on a large scale in order to realize the high-speed development of the national economy. This is a fundamental issue in socialist construction.
    After opposing rightist tendencies and boosting enthusiasm last year, the vast number of workers immediately launched a new upsurge in production, and the volume of transportation rose sharply. Facts have proved that no matter at any time or in any department, whenever the Party's general line is resolutely implemented, the rightist tendencies are thoroughly opposed, and the enthusiasm is boosted, the masses' fighting spirit will inevitably be high and production will flourish; conversely, no matter at any time or in any department, even if the Party's general line is slightly deviated from, and the rightist slackening sentiment is allowed to rise, production will slide down like a slope. The vast number of cadres and workers in the transportation sector have greatly improved their awareness and determination in implementing the general line from these negative and positive experiences, so that the transportation work has developed to a new stage after two consecutive years of Great Leap Forward.
    What marks this new stage is that Party committees from the central government to all levels have paid more attention to and strengthened the leadership of transportation work. Since the central government approved the transportation construction policy of the whole Party and the whole people running transportation and "local (local), mass (mass), and universal (universal)" in July 1958, Party committees at all levels have issued instructions on transportation work, and held meetings of professional cadres and telephone conferences to arrange and inspect the work. Especially in carrying out the mass short-distance transportation movement, the first secretaries of many provinces personally mobilized and deployed the work. Many Party committees of prefectures, counties, and people's communes have also strengthened the leadership of transportation, which has enabled the transportation work to develop smoothly, and provided us with a fundamental guarantee in politics and organization for the successful completion of transportation tasks.
    What marks this new stage is the formation of a new situation in which the whole Party and the whole people run transportation. In the past, transportation departments at all levels devoted most of their energy to engage in directly subordinate, modern, centralized, and small-scale transportation businesses, while placing local, folk, decentralized, and large-scale transportation tools in an extremely unimportant position. In the Great Leap Forward of industrial and agricultural production in 1958, the situation in which only a few professional departments were relied on to run transportation, which had been cold and deserted for a long time, underwent fundamental changes, and a vigorous mass movement in which the whole Party and the whole people ran transportation appeared. The mass campaign of running transportation on a large scale and carrying out transportation construction began to gradually develop from temporary, unorganized attacks to regular, organized actions. People's communes have sprung up to establish professional transportation teams, and factories and mines in all walks of life have also vigorously run transportation. A communist style of cooperation between production, transportation, and sales departments has flourished, and transportation is no longer regarded as a matter solely for the transportation department, but a cause of common concern for the production, transportation, and sales departments.
    What marks this new stage is the establishment of an increasingly complete transportation management system from the central government to the people's communes in various places. The transportation and shipping departments (bureaus) of the Ministry of Transportation, provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, the transportation management bureaus of special districts and counties, and the transportation stations or transportation command posts of the people's communes form a relatively complete transportation management system. In particular, many people's communes have gradually promoted the experience of "one station and four teams," and under the leadership of the commune transportation station, established professional transportation teams, sideline transportation teams, loading and unloading teams, and road maintenance teams, and continuously equipped this new force of transportation technically, so that the short-distance transportation in the vast rural areas has gradually become regularized, so that more transportation tasks can be completed with less labor.
    What marks this new stage is that all aspects have created many mature experiences. For example: the experience of people's communes running transportation, the experience of "one network and five transformations" in short-distance transportation, the experience of "one-dragon" large-scale cooperation in transportation organizations, the "safety, economy, and 10,000 ton-kilometers per ton per month movement" in automobile transportation, the "two reforms, one cleaning, and four transformations" of wooden sailing ship technical transformation (improving ship types and tool accessories, clearing warehouses ashore, ship transportation towing, port loading and unloading acceleration, tributary small river dredging, and local materials diversification) and the "six transformations" technical transformation of water trunk line transportation (mechanization and electrification of driving and operation, mechanization and semi-mechanization of fire operation, automation of refueling, mechanization and semi-mechanization of anchor lifting and cable winding, mechanization of rust removal and painting, mechanization and semi-mechanization of hatch cover opening and closing). What is valuable is that many experiences have not only produced good results in a short period of time, or in some areas, or in a certain professional work, but also are directional and comprehensive experiences that can be promoted and applied in many aspects for a long time. What is even more gratifying is that not only have many new experiences been created in a few areas with relatively developed transportation and a good foundation for mass movements, but also in remote areas with poor transportation construction in the past, many experiences worthy of attention have been created in the mass movement. In the past, it was not easy to find typical examples, but now pacesetters are in rows, red flags are in forests, experiences are in sets, and competitions are in networks. Everywhere learns from the advanced, catches up with the advanced, compares with the advanced, and helps the backward. Not only is the promotion fast, but it is also continuously improved and improved in mass practice, and a new situation of waves surging higher and higher is emerging. The "three reforms and five transformations" of Wangying District, Lichuan County, Hubei Province (changing manpower to animal power, changing carrying on shoulders to carts and boats, changing small roads to big roads, mountain aerialization, steep slope slidewayization, river channel ship transportationization, plain cartization, and transportation porterageization) has developed into "one network and five transformations" in Jiangbei County, Sichuan; Shanxi Province has carried out the experience of high-yield car ton-kilometer per month exceeding 10,000 tons over a large area; after these experiences were promoted in Shandong, Henan, Zhejiang and other provinces, the average car ton-kilometer per month of public cargo vehicles in the province reached the 10,000 ton-kilometer index in December last year. The "one-dragon" transportation and large-scale cooperation has appeared in rudimentary form in many places, but further creation and development has been made in Qinhuangdao Port and Changli County; Huaibei area in Anhui Province combined water conservancy construction to carry out river networkization relatively early, but Xinxiang Special Zone in Henan Province has done better in utilizing river networks for navigation. This also fully shows that the vast number of cadres and workers in the transportation sector have learned a set of working methods for carrying out mass movements in various tasks. Chairman Mao's working method of "boldly mobilizing the masses and doing everything through experiments" has been widely used in the transportation industry and has produced great results.
    In short, the central and local Party committees have strengthened the leadership of transportation work, the whole Party and the whole people are running transportation, a relatively complete transportation management system has been established from the central to the people's communes, and many mature experiences have been created in all aspects. These are the main signs that the transportation industry has developed to a new stage. Now, we have a more solid material and technical foundation than before, and we have stronger strength to overcome all the difficulties in the progress, thus further enhancing our confidence to go all out, aim high, and build the transportation industry in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way, and guarantee the continued leap forward of industrial and agricultural production this year through transportation. Now, all the employees of the transportation sector are full of infinite confidence in the future, and have stepped into 1960 with soaring ambition.

    Strive to Realize a Better, More Comprehensive, and Sustained Leap Forward in the Transportation Industry in 1960
    At present, after realizing the ambitious goal of achieving an all-round red and red to the end in 1959, the vast number of workers and masses on the transportation front, both land and water, have continuously reported good news, and have won the opening red, daily red, and redder every day. In January this year, the national local transportation freight volume increased by 8% compared with December last year, creating the highest level of monthly freight volume in history; breaking the "conventional" level of decline in transportation production at the beginning of the year and the beginning of the month, which has always been considered inevitable, and ensuring that the freight volume is not lower than the level of December last year. At the same time, it also completed the heavy passenger transport tasks during the Spring Festival, thus creating a situation of all-round red in the national transportation work in January. Although the transportation industry has achieved a continuous Great Leap Forward, it still cannot keep up with the needs of industrial and agricultural production, capital construction, and commodity circulation. Therefore, the transportation industry is still a relatively prominent weak link in the national economy. In order to change this situation and maintain a high-speed continued leap forward, it is necessary to resolutely implement the Party's general line for socialist construction and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies. The specific policies for transportation work in 1960 are: continue to implement the transportation construction policies of the whole Party and the whole people running transportation and "local, mass, and universal"; continuously carry out mass short-distance transportation movements and red flag competition movements for increasing production and saving economy; rectify, consolidate, expand, and arm the professional transportation teams of the people's communes; thoroughly carry out mass movements for technological revolution and technological innovation; vigorously promote the "one network and five transformations" of short-distance transportation, and vigorously carry out transportation construction; universally promote the experience of "one-dragon" transportation large-scale cooperation of various contents and forms; realize the continued leap forward of the transportation industry, so as to ensure the comprehensive completion of industrial and agricultural production, material exchange, and passenger transportation tasks. When implementing this policy, it is necessary to adhere to putting politics in command, consolidating the results of rectification, and strengthening political and ideological work; in terms of management, grasp "one-dragon" large-scale cooperation to improve production relations and improve transportation efficiency; and in all tasks, it is necessary to take technological innovation and technological revolution as the key to drive other work. In order to realize the continued leap forward of the transportation industry in 1960, the following tasks must be done well:
    1. Establish grassroots organizations for short-distance transportation, rectify, consolidate, and improve the transportation teams of the communes. The professional transportation teams of the people's communes and the sideline transportation teams of the production teams are an extremely important force on the short-distance transportation front. Necessary professional transportation teams should be continued to be expanded and equipped according to the needs of regular transportation tasks; those who have initially established a considerable number of professional teams should rectify the organization in a timely manner, pay attention to consolidating and improving them ideologically, organizationally, and technically, conduct in-depth education on the general line of socialist construction, lay the foundation for political and ideological foundations, and establish and improve the necessary management systems and organizational regulations. While establishing teams and consolidating organizations, technological innovation and technological revolution movements should be vigorously carried out, and transportation construction should be carried out on a large scale, and transportation teams should be equipped with more and better tools.
    While establishing, rectifying, consolidating, and improving transportation teams, communes should universally establish and improve transportation stations, which are both the commune's permanent transportation administrative management agencies and have the nature of enterprises and institutions. And according to needs and possibilities, establish loading and unloading teams and road maintenance teams directly under the leadership of the commune's transportation station to carry out regular loading and unloading, road and channel maintenance, and establish a system for repairing and maintaining transportation tools, so that the transportation work of the people's communes can adapt to the development of the commune economy and the needs of national short-distance transportation.
    2. Vigorously carry out technological innovation and technological revolution, vigorously promote "one network and five transformations," and vigorously carry out transportation construction. Experience has proven that carrying out mass movements for technological innovation and technological revolution can not only greatly improve transportation efficiency, tap the potential of equipment, and reduce labor intensity; at the same time, it is also a fundamental measure to support agriculture and reduce excessive occupation of labor in short-distance transportation. The mass movement for carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution must be purposeful to grasp weak links and solve key problems in transportation. Fully mobilize the masses, and vigorously carry out indigenous mechanization, semi-mechanization, and mechanization according to the principles of adapting to local conditions, taking materials locally, and combining indigenous and foreign methods, as well as manufacturing and repairing parts, self-reliance, and arming themselves; and use the method of "three combinations" to collectively study, systematically summarize, and actively promote according to industry. "One network and five transformations" is an important measure to thoroughly solve the problem of short-distance transportation. Its essence is: starting from reality, relying on the masses, self-reliance, taking materials locally, adapting to local conditions, comprehensive planning, and comprehensively utilizing various transportation methods. All localities must build a large number of roads according to the needs of transportation production, improve driving speed, and increase throughput capacity; improve rapids and dangerous shoals and narrow waterways, give full play to the role of water transportation, and combine agricultural water conservancy construction to use canals for navigation to reduce the pressure on land transportation. While building roads and opening rivers, it is also necessary to build various transportation tools on a large scale to realize cart and ship transportation, eliminate carrying on shoulders, and complete the largest transportation task with the least labor.
    In the mass technological innovation and technological revolution and large-scale transportation construction, it is also necessary to strengthen technical guidance for grassroots transportation organizations, especially the transportation stations of people's communes and the transportation organizations of factories and mines, and to timely summarize the experience of technological innovation and organize exchanges and promotion. During the movement, attention should be paid to selecting local experts, cultivating technical forces, carrying out multi-faceted movements, and advocating one specialty with multiple skills.
    3. Promote "one-dragon" transportation large-scale cooperation. The transportation industry needs to connect to all aspects of production, transportation, and sales in its own production process. It involves a wide range and the relationship is the most complex. It is necessary to do a good job in the cooperation of various links to fully exert the potential of various transportation tools. Experience has proven that various forms of cooperation have promoted the rapid development of transportation productivity, and have also promoted the development of production in industrial and mining departments, accelerated the exchange between urban and rural areas, and brought great benefits to the entire national economy. Therefore, it is necessary to further promote the spirit of active cooperation, overcome various departmentalism ideas, and clearly establish the idea that transportation serves production and production creates conditions for transportation; giving convenience to others and leaving difficulties to oneself. Only in this way can a situation of dragons flying and vying to leap forward be formed throughout the country.
    4. Continue to carry out red flag competition movements for increasing production and saving economy comprehensively, widely, and deeply. Carrying out red flag competition movements for increasing production and saving economy centered on technological innovation and technological revolution is one of the effective measures to fully tap the potential of existing tools and equipment and improve transportation production efficiency. The masses should be mobilized in the spirit of the general line, pace-setters should be established at all levels, and the advanced should lead the backward. Through competition, the upsurge of production should be pushed forward wave after wave. In the competition movement, there must be clear slogans for action, the goals must be clear, and the long-term goals must be combined with the current specific goals. In automobile transportation, continue to carry out labor competitions for safety, economy, and 10,000 ton-kilometers per ton per month, actively promote double-shift and trailer transportation, more transportation, faster transportation, increase production, save gasoline, tires, and accessories, strengthen vehicle maintenance and road maintenance, improve the integrity rate of automobiles, reduce costs, promote various safe driving operation experiences, and organize self-used freight trucks from all aspects of national organs, enterprises, schools, groups, etc., into the national automobile transportation joint friendship competition. In water transport enterprises, continue to carry out the "six comparisons" competition movement centered on accelerating ship turnover.
    Folk transportation vehicles should also be organized into various forms of competition. For example, compare quick loading and more transportation, compare safe production, compare livestock strength, compare vehicle integrity, compare love for national property, compare compliance with regulations, etc. In horse-drawn cart transportation, actively carry out the 1,000 ton-kilometer per ton per month movement, and constantly improve the efficiency of folk transportation tools.
    We believe that under the strong leadership of Party committees at all levels, the vast number of employees in the transportation sector, holding high the red flag of the general line, adhering to the policy of "walking on two legs," carrying out mass movements on a large scale, and widely carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution, will ensure high production with high transportation, achieve increased production without increasing personnel, and the transportation industry will surely be able to achieve a better, more comprehensive, and continued leap forward in 1960 on the basis of the past two years of continuous Great Leap Forward.

    连续大跃进中的交通运输事业
    交通部部长　王首道
    交通运输事业昂首阔步高歌猛进的一年
    1959年是我国人民循着党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，昂首阔步，高歌猛进的一年。我们热烈欢呼总路线的胜利，大跃进的胜利，人民公社化的胜利。我国第二个五年计划所规定的主要指标已提前三年完成了。一年来，随着工农业生产的飞跃发展，交通运输事业也在1958年特大跃进的基础上又继续大跃进，交通面貌起了急剧的变化。1952年底，全国只有公路十二万多公里，有三分之一的县不通汽车；现在全国公路里程已达四十八万多公里，基本上形成了全国公路干线网。全国通航河道在1952年只有九万多公里，去年增加到十六万公里，其中通轮船的航道从二万公里增加到四万公里，河网化通航里程达到四万多公里。与1952年相比，公路里程增长280％，航道里程增长68％，各种运输工具也有很大的增长。几千年来，“南船北车”的习惯起了深刻变化，现在除青海以外，全国各省、区的水运事业都有新的发展。有些省、区过去没有水运，现在也有了通船的航道，并且发展了不少机动船舶，对几千年遗留下来的木帆船运输，正在逐步实现机动化和拖带化。有些地区已经形成了四通八达的水运网。南方许多地区实现了车子化，北方是大小河川到处张扬白帆，某些专区、县之间还开辟了地方民用航空线。
    1959年交通运输的继续大跃进，是由开展大规模的群众性的短途运输运动和交通建设运动，以及在交通企业、事业单位广泛开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动形成的。这是交通运输部门在各级党委领导下，高举毛泽东思想的旗帜，在不断革命的理论指导之下，坚决执行了党的建设社会主义的总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”方针的伟大胜利，是群众运动的伟大胜利。
    自从去年中共中央、国务院联合发出关于开展群众短途运输运动的指示以后，一个波澜壮阔的、群众性的短途运输运动立即在全国各地形成，广大农村基层的运输组织获得了空前发展，在全国两万五千多个人民公社中，建立了五万多个专业运输队和七万多个副业运输队。为了加强对专业运输队和副业运输队的领导，各地人民公社普遍建立了交通运输站，配备专职干部，健全了各种管理制度，从组织上、制度上加以保证，使人民公社专业运输队和副业运输队逐步地走上了巩固和提高的阶段，从而用较少的劳动力完成了更多的运输任务。
    在群众性的短途运输运动中，广大农村根据就地取材、因地制宜的原则，大搞交通建设，普遍推广了四川省江北县“一网五化”的经验，在平原地区和较平坦的地段，大搞车子化、轨道化；在有河流可通的地方，积极整治河道，大搞船运化；在山区、丘陵地带和有坡度可利用的地方，大搞索道化、溜槽化；并且以这“五化”组成了一个四通八达的短途运输网。与此同时，各地群众还创造了许多优良车型、改进车轴车轮、实现多轮化，充分发挥了动力、畜力的牵引作用，不仅汽车列车化有了更加广泛的推行，木帆船也较普遍地经过船型的改良，安装小型动力机，实行了机动化、拖带化；在北方马拉列车正在推广，南方有些省则推行了牛拉列车，西北各省区推行骆驼拉列车。所有这些，都极大地提高了现有运输设备的运输效率。现在，拖带运输不论在陆地和水上，不论在近代运输工具，还是民间运输工具方面，都是技术革新和技术革命的方向。
    1959年交通运输企业的劳动竞赛，也有了更进一步的发展。在水路运输方面，开展了以加速船舶周转为中心的比高产、比优质、比低耗、比安全、比协作、比技术革新的“六比”红旗竞赛运动，要求江河拖轮马力月产一万五千吨公里，江海货轮船吨月产五千吨公里、木帆船船吨月产一千吨公里。在汽车运输方面，开展“安全、节约、车吨月产万吨公里”运动；在民用航空运输方面，开展了安全生产“六好”（保证安全好、增产节约好、服务质量好、技术革新和技术革命开展得好、政治思想好、执行红专规划好）红旗竞赛；从而使船舶、汽车的运输效率同1958年相比，都提高了近一倍。使一艘船、一辆汽车发挥了两艘船、两辆汽车的运输作用。民用航空的月产水平，也比1958年提高了50％。
    1959年全国交通运输部门在企业管理上的突出成就，是推广了产、运、销“一条龙”运输大协作的经验。各地在推广运输大协作的经验过程中，又不断地发展和充实了这一成功经验。随着“一条龙”运输的发展，各地运输部门之间以及产、运、销各部门之间的协作关系，也在发展，不断地出现新型的、更高的和较完善的协作形式。这种生产关系上的改善，大大解放了运输生产的潜力，使交通运输工作发挥出巨大的物质力量，更好地为工农业生产继续跃进服务。
    1959年全国机关、企业、学校、团体的自备载货汽车，在优先完成本单位运输任务的前提下，积极参加了计划运输；中国人民解放军的后勤部队，也抽调了大批汽车协助各地交通部门完成了不少紧急的运输任务。
    随着交通运输事业的飞跃发展，交通运输科学技术工作和交通干部的培养，都取得了巨大的成就。
    总之，1959年交通运输同其他国民经济各部门一样，获得了辉煌的成就，完成了国民经济大跃进对运输部门提出的任务。
        交通运输事业发展的新阶段
    交通运输部门的干部和职工，深刻地体会到右倾必须反透，干劲必须鼓足，社会主义建设总路线的红旗必须高高举起，必须大搞群众运动，才能实现国民经济的高速度发展。这是社会主义建设中一个根本问题。
    经过去年反右倾、鼓干劲，广大职工立即掀起了新的生产高潮，运输量直线上升。事实证明：不论在任何时候、任何部门，凡是坚决贯彻执行了党的总路线，把右倾反透，把干劲鼓足，群众斗志必然就会昂扬，生产蒸蒸日上；反之，不论在任何时候、任何部门，哪怕是稍微地离开了党的总路线，让右倾松劲情绪抬头，生产就好像滑坡一样地溜了下来。交通运输部门的广大干部和职工，从这些反面正面的经验中，大大提高了对贯彻执行总路线的自觉性和坚定性，从而使交通运输工作经过两年连续的大跃进，已经发展到一个新的阶段。
    标志着这个新阶段的是：从中央到各级党委，都更加重视和加强了对交通运输工作的领导。从1958年7月中央批准了全党全民办交通和“地（地方）、群（群众）、普（普及）”的交通建设方针后，各级党委都对交通运输工作作了指示，并且召开专业干部会议、电话会议布置检查工作。特别是在开展群众性的短途运输运动中，许多省的第一书记亲自动员和部署工作。许多地、县和人民公社党委也都加强了对交通运输的领导，这就使得交通运输工作得以顺利地发展，使我们胜利地完成交通运输任务有了政治上和组织上的根本保证。
    标志着这个新阶段的是：形成了全党全民办交通的新形势。过去各级交通部门，都以绝大部分精力去搞直属的、近代的、集中的、少量的运输业务，而把地方的、民间的、分散的、大量的运输工具，却放在极次要的地位。在1958年工农业生产大跃进中，那种只靠少数专业部门办交通，因而长期处于冷冷清清的局面发生了根本变化，出现了全党全民办交通的轰轰烈烈的群众运动。群众性的大办运输，大搞交通建设运动，开始由临时性的无组织的突击，逐步发展为经常的有组织的行动。人民公社都风起云涌地建立专业运输队，各行各业工厂矿山也都纷纷大办运输。产、运、销各部门之间大兴共产主义协作之风，运输已不再被认为单纯是交通部门的事情，而是产、运、销各部门共同关心的事业。
    标志着这个新阶段的是：从中央到各地人民公社建立起一个日益完整的交通运输管理体系。交通部、省、市、自治区交通、航运厅（局），专区和县的交通管理局，人民公社的交通运输站或运输指挥所，形成了一个较完整的交通运输管理体系。特别是不少人民公社逐步推广了“一站四队”的经验，在公社交通运输站的领导下，成立了专业运输队、副业运输队、装卸队和养路队，并不断从技术上装备了这支新生的运输力量，使得广大农村的短途运输逐渐走上经常化，从而可以用较少的劳动力完成更多的运输任务。
    标志着这个新阶段的是：各方面都创造了许多成熟的经验。例如：人民公社办交通的经验，短途运输“一网五化”的经验，运输组织中“一条龙”大协作的经验，汽车运输中的“安全、节约、车吨月产万吨公里运动”，木帆船技术改造的“两改、一清、四化”（改良船型和工具属具，清仓上岸，船舶运输拖带化、港口装卸快速化、支流小河畅通化、就地取材多样化）和水上干线运输的“六化”技术改造（驾驶操纵机械化、电气化，生火操作机械化、半机械化，加油自动化，起锚绞缆机械化、半机械化，敲锈、油漆机械化，仓盖启闭机械化、半机械化）。可贵的是，有许多经验不仅是在短期内，或在部分地区中，或在某一项专业工作上产生了良好的效果，而且是带有方向性的综合性的经验，能够长期地在多方面推广应用。更可喜的是，不仅在少数交通事业比较发达、群众运动基础较好的地区创造了很多新的经验，而且在过去交通建设较差的边远地区，也在大搞群众运动中创造了不少值得重视的经验，过去找典型不很容易，而现在标兵成列，红旗成林，经验成套，竞赛成网。处处学先进、赶先进、比先进、帮后进，不仅推广得快，并且在群众实践中又不断提高改进，出现后浪推前浪，一浪高一浪的新局面。湖北利川县汪营区“三改五化”（改人力为畜力，改肩挑为车船，改小路为大路，山上天线化、陡坡滑道化、河道船运化、平地车子化、运输驮运化）的经验，在四川江北县发展为“一网五化”；山西省开展汽车车吨月产万吨公里运动大面积高产的经验；在山东、河南、浙江等省推广了这些经验以后，全省公用载货汽车去年12月份平均车吨月产达到了万吨公里指标。“一条龙”运输大协作，在不少地方都曾出现过雏型，但在秦皇岛港和昌黎县有了进一步的创造和发展；安徽淮北地区结合水利建设大搞河网化是比较早的，但河南新乡专区在利用河网通航方面作得更好。这里也充分说明，交通运输部门的广大干部和职工，在各项工作中都学会了一套大搞群众运动的工作方法。毛主席指示我们的“放手发动群众，一切通过试验”的工作方法，已经在交通事业中较普遍地运用，并产生了巨大的效果。
    总之，中央和各级党委加强了对交通运输工作的领导，全党全民办交通，从中央到人民公社建立起较完整的交通运输管理体系，在各方面都创造了许多成熟的经验，这就是交通事业发展到新阶段的主要标志。现在，我们已经具有比以前更雄厚的物质技术基础，具有更坚强的力量战胜一切前进中的困难，因而更增强我们的信心来鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设交通事业，从运输上来保证今年工农业生产的继续跃进。现在，交通运输部门的全体职工，对未来充满了无限的信心，壮志凌云跨进了1960年。
    为实现1960年交通运输事业更好的全面的持续跃进而努力
    目前，交通战线上的广大职工群众，在实现了1959年全面红、红到底的雄心壮志之后，水陆运输各个战线又不断传来捷报，夺得了开门红、日日红、一天更比一天红。今年1月份，全国地方交通货运量比去年12月份增长8％，创历来月度货运量的最高水平；打破了历来认为不可避免的年初、月初运输生产水平下降的“常规”，保证了货运量不低于去年12月的水平。同时还完成了春节期间繁重的客运任务，从而出现了1月份全国交通运输工作满堂红的局面。虽然交通运输业获得了连续大跃进，但是仍然赶不上工农业生产、基本建设、商品流转等方面的需要。因此，交通运输业仍然是国民经济中一个比较突出的薄弱环节。为了改变这种状况，保持高速度的继续跃进，必须坚决地贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，1960年交通运输工作的具体方针是：继续贯彻全党全民办交通和“地、群、普”的交通建设方针；持续开展群众性的短途运输运动和增产节约红旗竞赛运动；整顿、巩固、壮大和武装人民公社的专业运输队；深入开展技术革命与技术革新的群众运动；大力推广短途运输的“一网五化”，大搞交通建设；普遍推广各种内容和各种形式的“一条龙”运输大协作的经验；实现交通运输事业的继续跃进，以保证全面完成工农业生产、物资交流和旅客运输任务。在贯彻这个方针的时候，必须坚持政治挂帅，巩固整风成果，加强政治思想工作；在管理工作方面，抓好“一条龙”大协作，以改善生产关系，提高运输效率；而在各项工作中，都必须以技术革新和技术革命为纲，带动其他工作。为了实现1960年交通运输事业的继续跃进，必须作好以下几项工作：
    一、建立短途运输的基层组织，整顿、巩固和提高公社的运输队伍。人民公社的专业运输队和生产队的副业运输队是短途运输战线上的一支极重要的队伍。应当根据经常性运输任务的需要，把必要的专业运输队继续壮大和装备起来；已初步建立了相当数量专业队伍的，要及时整顿组织，注意从思想上、组织上、技术上加以巩固和提高，深入进行社会主义建设总路线的教育，奠定政治思想基础，并建立和健全必要的管理制度、组织条例。在建立队伍和巩固组织的同时，应大力开展技术革新和技术革命运动，大搞交通建设，用更多更好的工具把运输队装备起来。
    在建立、整顿和巩固提高运输队的同时，公社应普遍建立和健全交通运输站，它既是公社常设的交通运输行政管理机构，又具有企业和事业单位的性质。并根据需要与可能，建立公社交通运输站直接领导下的装卸队和养路队，进行经常性的装卸、道路和航道养护工作，以及建立维修运输工具的制度，使人民公社的交通运输工作能够适应公社经济的发展和国家短途运输的需要。
    二、大闹技术革新和技术革命，大力推广“一网五化”，大搞交通建设。经验证明，开展群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，不仅可以大大提高运输效率，发挥设备潜力，减轻劳动强度；同时，也是为了支援农业，减少短途运输中过多占用劳动力的根本措施。开展技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，必须是有目的的抓薄弱环节，解决运输中的关键问题。充分发动群众，根据因地制宜、就地取材、土洋并举的方针，大搞土机械化、半机械化和机械化，以及制造维修用的配件，自力更生，自己武装自己；并用“三结合”的办法，按行业集体研究，系统总结，积极推广。“一网五化”是彻底解决短途运输问题的重要措施。它的实质是：从实际出发，依靠群众，自力更生，就地取材，因地制宜，全面规划，综合利用各种运输方式。各地都必须根据运输生产的需要，大量修建道路，提高行车速度，增加通过能力；整治急流险滩和狭窄水道，充分发挥水上运输的作用，结合农田水利建设，利用渠道通航，以减轻陆上运输的压力。在修路开河的同时，还要大造各种运输工具，实现车子化、船运化，消除肩挑人背，用最少的劳动力去完成最大的运输任务。
    在大闹技术革新和技术革命、大搞交通建设中，还必须对基层运输组织，特别是人民公社的交通运输站，以及厂矿企业的运输组织，加强技术指导，及时总结技术革新的经验，组织交流推广。运动中，要注意选拔土专家，培养技术力量，开展多面手运动，提倡一专多能。
    三、推广“一条龙”运输大协作。交通运输业在自己的生产过程中要联系到产、运、销的各方面，牵涉面广，关系也最复杂，必须搞好各个环节的协作，才能充分发挥各种运输工具的潜在能力。经验证明，各种形式的协作都促进了运输生产力的迅速发展，同时也促进了工矿部门生产的发展，加速了城乡交流，给整个国民经济带来很大的好处。因此，必须进一步发扬主动协作之风，克服各种本位主义思想，明确地树立：运输为生产服务，生产为运输创造条件的思想；把方便让给别人，把困难留给自己，只有这样，才能在全国形成群龙飞舞争相跃进的局面。
    四、继续全面、广泛、深入地开展增产节约红旗竞赛运动。开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约红旗竞赛运动，是充分挖掘现有工具设备的潜力，提高运输生产效率的有效措施之一。以总路线的精神来发动群众，层层树标兵，先进带后进，通过竞赛，把生产高潮一浪高一浪地推向前进。在竞赛运动中，必须有鲜明的行动口号，要目标明确，而且要使远大目标和当前的具体奋斗目标结合起来。在汽车运输中，继续开展安全、节约、车吨月产万吨公里的劳动竞赛，积极推广双班和拖挂运输，多运、快运，增加生产，节约汽油、轮胎和配件，加强车辆保养维修和公路养护，提高汽车完好率，降低成本，推广各种安全驾驶操作经验，并把全国各机关、企业、学校、团体等各方面的自用货车，都组织到全国汽车运输联合友谊竞赛中来。在水运企业中，继续开展以加速船舶周转为中心的“六比”竞赛运动。
    民间运输车辆，也要组织各种形式的竞赛。例如，比快装多运，比安全生产，比牲畜强壮，比车辆完好，比爱护国家财产，比遵守制度等。在马车运输中，积极开展车吨月产千吨公里运动，不断地提高民间运输工具的效率。
    我们相信，在各级党委的坚强领导下，交通运输部门的广大职工，高举总路线的红旗，坚持“两条腿走路”的方针，大搞群众运动，广泛开展技术革新和技术革命，以高运保高产，做到增产不增人，交通事业一定可以在过去两年连续大跃进的基础上，实现1960年更好的全面的继续跃进。
