    Everything Depends on Consciousness
    Jing Yu
    Whenever a new production quarter (or year) begins, various production enterprises sign ordering contracts with relevant units, stipulating delivery dates. From then on, the ordering contract becomes a legal instrument, and the attitude of both parties to this instrument becomes a crucial key to the leap forward in enterprise production.
    In the first quarter of this year, the North China Radio Equipment United Factory signed 581 contracts with 401 units, covering more than 130 product varieties and more than 8,000 specifications. The production task can be described as huge. However, they are doing very well in completing their production plan. So far, they have completed more than 80% of the delivery contract tasks for the first quarter, strongly supporting the leap forward of brother units. With more than a month to go, it is now certain that they will overfulfill the contract tasks for the first quarter. Fulfilling contracts is a major event in the production leap forward. The production of one enterprise unit is often closely related to the production of several enterprise units. A great leap forward in one enterprise unit can drive the great leap forward in many enterprise units; if one enterprise unit cannot fulfill its ordering contract, it will inevitably affect the normal production of many enterprise units. This kind of entanglement and influence is clearly not just an economic issue, but a political issue, a problem of mutual assistance and cooperation between socialist enterprises. Therefore, fulfilling contracts is by no means a trivial matter, but a major event related to the overall situation, and it is entirely appropriate to treat it as a political task.
    From the perspective of factories and enterprises themselves, it is more cost-effective to produce simple and easy products and mass-produce them, while it is more difficult to produce products in smaller batches. However, socialist enterprises are a unified whole of all economic sectors of the country and must have a global perspective. The interests of the overall situation are the greatest interests, while the interests of individual enterprises are only a small part of the entire overall situation. The workers and staff of the North China Radio Equipment United Factory have precisely clarified this problem, recognizing that their main task is to serve the rapid completion of sets of tasks, and recognizing that seriously and conscientiously treating each contract is to specifically implement the spirit of "the whole country as one chessboard." Therefore, the leap forward of the factories that have contractual relationships with them has been guaranteed, and their own work has also been improved.
    The North China Radio Equipment United Factory's attitude towards contracts is correct, and the achievements reflected in production are remarkable. This is also an example of the superstructure's ideology affecting the economic base.

    一切取决于自觉
    静宇
    每当新的生产季度（或年度）开始以前，各个生产企业都同有关单位签下了订货合同，规定了交货日期。从此，订货合同就成为合法的契据，而订货双方采取什么态度对待这个契据，就成为企业生产跃进的一个重要关键。
    华北无线电器材联合厂今年第一季度内就和四百零一个单位签订了五百八十一份合同，产品品种达一百三十多种，规格达八千多种，生产任务可谓大矣。然而，他们完成生产计划则很好。到目前为止，他们已经完成了第一季度交货合同任务的80％以上，有力地支援了兄弟单位的跃进。剩下一个多月的时间，预计超额完成一季度合同任务，已经肯定无疑了。履行合同，是生产跃进中的一件大事。一个企业单位的生产，常常同几个企业单位的生产有着紧密关连。一个企业单位的大跃进，可以带动许多企业单位的大跃进；一个企业单位不能实现订货合同，势必影响很多企业单位的正常生产。这种牵连影响，显然不仅仅是经济问题，而是一项政治问题，是社会主义企业间互助协作问题。所以，履行合同，绝不是一件小事，而是关系全局的大事，把它当做一项政治任务是十分确当的。
    从工厂企业本身来说，生产那些简单容易和成批生产的产品，是比较合算的，而生产那些批量较小的产品，则比较困难。但是，社会主义企业是全国各个经济部门的统一的整体，必须有全局观点。全局的利益是最大的利益，而个别企业的利益，只是整个全局的小部分。华北无线电器材联合厂的职工正是弄清楚了这个问题，认识到自己的主要任务就是为任务迅速成套服务，认识到严肃认真地对待每一件合同，就是具体贯彻执行“全国一盘棋”的精神，因此，同他们有合同关系的工厂的跃进得到了保证，而他们自己的工作也得到了提高。
    华北无线电器材联合厂对待合同的态度是正确的，反映在生产上的成绩是显著的，这也是上层建筑意识形态作用于经济基础的一例。
