Welcome the Departments to Be Promoters

Yang Zejun, National Advanced Producer, Fitter at Chongqing Radio Factory

The work of the departments in our Chongqing Radio Factory is very different from the past. In the past, department staff often waited for workers to come to them before solving problems. When workers encountered problems in production, they couldn't be resolved quickly, which affected production. Therefore, workers often criticized the departments. Since the second half of last year, the work of the departments in our factory has undergone a great change. When we workers engage in technical innovation, the department cadres come down to help with design, offer direction, solve technical problems, supervise the rush production of equipment, and deliver urgently needed materials and tools to our doorsteps, which has made our innovation movement fast and effective. The relationship between the department cadres and the workers has become increasingly close, and everyone often praises the work of the departments.

Departmental work is part of the relations of production. Changes in the relations of production can promote the development of the productive forces. The current mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement is promoting the development of the productive forces. If the work of the production management departments adapts to the productive forces, it can play a promoting role; if it does not adapt, it will play a hindering role. It is precisely because the department personnel of our factory actively strive to be promoters that the technical innovation movement in our factory has become more vibrant, and production has developed even faster. Take January of this year as an example: the entire factory put forward more than six thousand innovation proposals, and more than five thousand were immediately implemented, with the monthly production task overfulfilled by 29.72%. This is mainly due to the leadership of the Party and the efforts of our workers, but it is also inseparable from the department cadres doing everything possible to help us realize innovation proposals.

Taking my own experience as an example, after returning from the National Congress of Heroes last October, under the correct leadership of the Party, I worked with my comrades to vigorously engage in innovation. Up to the beginning of February this year, I had reformed a total of fifty-four items, completing more than four years of work. In the process of implementing these proposals, the various departments of our factory helped me solve many problems. In January of this year, in order to solve the difficulty of insufficient lathes, I, together with the workers in the workshop, converted an old lathe into a program-controlled automatic lathe. The material supply department promptly found enameled wire, relays, and metal materials, solving the problem of a lack of raw materials. During the design and installation of the electrical parts, because I am a fitter and do not understand electrical technology, I could not proceed. Comrade Yang Yuming, a technician from the New Technology Promotion Department, took the initiative to help design a complete set of electrical circuit diagrams and personally installed them. At the same time, he and another technician designed automatic feeding and monitoring equipment, making the automatic equipment of this lathe even more complete. During the test run, we encountered the difficulty that the drum-shaped control instrument controlling the cutting tools could not work, and technicians Shen Kunli, Yang Yuming, and others came to help me again. We worked together for two days and nights of continuous testing without finding the cause. On the second night, at more than eleven o'clock, the chairman of the factory trade union and the technicians Zi Chengshun, Xia Wenyuan, and others from the technology department came to the workshop for a detailed inspection, found the cause, and immediately made improvements. As a result, the processing effect was very good, creating favorable conditions for realizing multi-machine tool management.

From the above facts, I deeply realize the important role of departmental work in developing production. We workers warmly welcome department cadres to be promoters in the mass movement. In the future, the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement will become increasingly fierce, and the number of problems that need to be solved by the departments will also increase. I hope that department personnel will build on their existing achievements and go even further.

    欢迎科室当促进派
    全国先进生产者　重庆无线电厂钳工　杨泽君
    我们重庆无线电厂的科室工作，和过去大不相同了。过去，科室工作人员常常要等工人找上门，才去解决问题。工人在生产中遇到问题，不能很快解决，影响生产。因此工人经常对科室提意见。从去年下半年起，我们厂里的科室工作大变样了，我们工人搞技术革新，科室干部下来帮着搞设计，提方向，解决技术难题，督促赶制设备，把急要的材料工具送上门，使得我们的革新运动搞得又快又好。科室干部和工人的关系越来越密切了，大伙经常表扬科室的工作。
    科室工作是生产关系的一部分。生产关系的改变，可以促进生产力的发展。目前群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动正在促进生产力向前发展，如果生产管理部门的工作与生产力相适应，就能起促进作用；如果不相适应，就会起促退作用。正因我们厂的科室人员积极努力当促进派，使得我们厂里的技术革新运动搞得更有声色，生产也发展得更快了。就拿今年1月份来说吧，全厂提出六千多件革新建议，马上就实现了五千多件，全月生产任务超额完成了29．72％。这主要是党的领导和我们工人的努力，但也是和科室干部千方百计帮助我们实现革新建议分不开的。
    拿我的体会来讲，去年10月下旬，我从全国群英会回来后，在党的正确领导下，我和同志们一道，大闹革新，今年到2月上旬止，共改革了五十四项，完成四年多工作量。我在实现这些建议过程中，我们厂里的各个科室帮助我解决了很多问题。今年1月，为了解决车床不足的困难，我和车间的工人一起，将一部老元车改为程序控制自动车床，材料供应部门及时找到了漆包线、继电器和金属材料，解决了原材料缺乏的问题。在设计和安装电气部分时，因为我是钳工，不懂电气技术，无法进行。新技术推广科的技术员杨玉明同志，主动来帮助设计了全套电气线路图，又亲自动手安装。同时他还和另一个技术员设计了自动加料和监督设备，使这部车床的自动设备更加完备。在试车过程中，又遇到控制刀具的鼓形控制仪不能工作的困难，技术员沈坤立、杨玉明等同志又来帮助我。我们一起连续试验了两昼夜，没有找到原因。第二天晚上十一点多，厂工会主席和技术科的技术员紫成顺、夏文远等同志，又来车间作了详细检查，找到了原因，立即作了改进，结果加工效果甚好，为实现多机床管理创造了有利条件。
    从上面这些事实，我深深体会到科室工作对于发展生产的重要作用。我们工人十分欢迎科室干部在群众运动中当促进派。今后，技术革新和技术革命运动的发展将越来越猛烈，需要科室解决的问题也越来越多。我希望科室人员在现有成绩的基础上，百尺竿头，更进一步。
