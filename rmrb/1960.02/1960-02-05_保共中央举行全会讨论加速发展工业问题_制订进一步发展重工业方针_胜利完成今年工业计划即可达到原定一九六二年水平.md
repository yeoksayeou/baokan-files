Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, Electric Dispatch: The Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee plenary session discussing industrial issues was held from January 26th to 29th. Todor Zhivkov, First Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee, spoke before the meeting concluded. Zhivkov pointed out in his speech that this plenary session is of great significance for the further high tide of Bulgaria's socialist industry, and he called on workers, engineering and technical personnel, and the national laboring people to contribute all their strength and wisdom to completing this year's plan.

According to reports in local newspapers, this central plenary session discussed in detail and in depth the issue of accelerating the development of Bulgaria's socialist industry and technological progress.

The plenary session passed a resolution "On Further Developing Heavy Industry, Expanding the Raw Material Base for Heavy Industry, Specialization and Collaboration in Production, and Accelerating Industrial Technological Progress."

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, February 2nd Electric Dispatch: According to reports in local newspapers: Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee Secretariat Secretary Zoloff said in a report at the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee plenary session that opened on January 26th that after the completion of the 1960 plan, Bulgaria's industry will reach the level of the final year of the Third Five-Year Plan—1962.

He said that now, Bulgaria has a considerable raw material base, sufficient to guarantee the smooth development of its national industry. As of January 1, 1960, the proven coal reserves were 4.5 billion tons, iron ore – approximately 300 million tons, lead-zinc ore – over 100 million tons, copper ore – over 100 million tons, petroleum – approximately 2.3 million tons, gas – hundreds of millions of cubic meters, salt mines – approximately 1 billion tons.

Zoloff delivered a report at the meeting entitled "On Further Developing Heavy Industry, Expanding the Raw Material Base for Heavy Industry, and Specialization of Production." In his report, he pointed out the achievements made by Bulgaria's heavy industry after the establishment of the people's government.

He said that the machine-building industry has developed rapidly. In 1959, the output value of the machine-building industry was 50% more than the entire industrial output value in 1939. The significant increase in the basic production funds of industry can also illustrate the rapid development of industry. In 1948, the basic production funds of the industrial sectors producing means of production were 2,826 million levs, while at the beginning of 1959, this type of fund had increased to 16,518 million levs. During the same period, the production of means of production increased by approximately six times. The ratio between industrial and agricultural output value in 1958 was 69.9 to 30.1.

Zoloff said that due to the development of industrialization, Bulgaria's working class ranks have rapidly grown stronger. In the period from 1948 to 1958 alone, the number of workers in the industrial sector increased by 1.3 times.

Zoloff emphasized that the achievements we have made show that the Party's general line of accelerating the development of Bulgaria's economy is correct and feasible.

The reporter talked in detail about some issues that play a decisive role in the successful completion of the task of accelerating the development of industry and the entire national economy, such as issues concerning the further development of power, coal, ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy, machine manufacturing, and the chemical industry, specialization and collaboration issues, expanding the raw material base for heavy industry, and ensuring the necessary number of workers and engineering technical cadres.

Zoloff emphasized that the Party Central Committee attaches great importance to expanding the industrial raw material base. In the next five to ten years, the open-pit reserves of petroleum, gas, coal, iron, lead, zinc, copper, rare metals, and other minerals should be greatly increased; in particular, new industrial petroleum and coal mines should be developed.

Editor's Note: According to the 1960 National Economic Development Plan Law approved by the Fourth Special Session of the Bulgarian National Assembly held last December, this year Bulgaria's total industrial output value will increase by 15.2% compared to last year, that is, it will reach over approximately 44 billion levs; the level originally planned for 1962 in the Third Five-Year Plan was 43,843 million levs. The plan stipulates that this year, 4,532 million kilowatt-hours of electricity will be produced, 17,390,000 tons of coal, 146,400 tons of iron for steelmaking, and 305,000 tons of steel.

    保共中央举行全会讨论加速发展工业问题
    制订进一步发展重工业方针
    胜利完成今年工业计划即可达到原定一九六二年水平
    新华社索非亚电　讨论工业问题的保加利亚共产党中央委员会全体会议于1月26日至29日举行。保共中央第一书记日夫科夫在会议结束前讲了话。日夫科夫在讲话中指出，这次全会对保加利亚社会主义工业进一步高涨有巨大意义，他并号召工人、工程技术人员和全国劳动人民为完成今年计划而贡献出一切力量和智慧。
    据这里报纸报道，这次中央全会详细而深刻地讨论了关于加速发展保加利亚社会主义工业和技术进步问题。
    全会通过了“关于进一步发展重工业、扩大重工业原料基地、生产专业化和协作以及加速工业技术进步”的决议。
    新华社索非亚2日电　据此间报纸报道：保加利亚共产党中央委员会书记处书记佐洛夫在1月26日开幕的保共中央全会上所作的报告中说，在1960年计划完成以后，保加利亚的工业将达到第三个五年计划最后一年——1962年的水平。
    他说，现在，保加利亚拥有相当大的原料基地，足以保证本国工业的顺利发展。到1960年1月1日为止，已探明的煤藏量为四十五亿吨，铁矿——大约三亿吨，铅锌矿——一亿吨以上，铜矿——一亿吨以上，石油——大约二百三十万吨，瓦斯——数亿立方米，盐矿——大约十亿吨。
    佐洛夫在会上作了题为“关于进一步发展重工业，扩大重工业原料基地和生产专业化”的报告。他在报告中指出了保加利亚重工业在人民政权建立后所取得的成就。
    他说，机器制造业有了迅速的发展。1959年机器制造业的产值比1939年整个工业产值还多50％。工业的基本生产基金的显著增长也可以说明工业的迅速发展。1948年，生产生产资料的工业部门的基本生产基金为二十八亿二千六百万列弗，而1959年年初这种基金就增加到一百六十五亿一千八百万列弗。在同一时期，生产资料的生产增长了大约六倍。1958年工业和农业产值之间的比例是六十九点九比三十点一。
    佐洛夫说，由于工业化的发展，保加利亚的工人阶级队伍迅速地壮大。仅在1948至1958年期间，工业部门中的工人人数就增加了一点三倍。
    佐洛夫强调说，我们取得的成就表明，党关于加速发展保加利亚经济的总路线是正确的、切实可行的。
    报告人详细地谈到了对于顺利地完成加速发展工业和整个国民经济的任务起决定作用的一些问题，如关于进一步发展动力、煤炭、黑色和有色冶金、机器制造业和化学工业的问题，专业化和协作问题，扩大重工业原料基地，以及保证有必要数量的工人和工程技术干部的问题。
    佐洛夫强调说，党中央非常重视扩大工业原料基地。在今后五年至十年内，要大大增加石油、瓦斯、煤、铁、铅锌、铜、稀有金属和其他矿物的露天矿藏；特别要开发新的工业用的石油矿和煤矿。
    编者注　根据去年12月举行的保加利亚国民议会第四次特别会议批准的1960年国民经济发展计划法，今年保加利亚的工业总产值将比去年增长15．2％，即达到约四百四十亿列弗以上，第三个五年计划原来规定的1962年的水平是四百三十八亿四千三百万列弗。计划规定，今年将生产电力四十五亿三千二百万度，煤一千七百三十九万吨，炼钢用铁十四万六千四百吨，钢三十万五千吨。
