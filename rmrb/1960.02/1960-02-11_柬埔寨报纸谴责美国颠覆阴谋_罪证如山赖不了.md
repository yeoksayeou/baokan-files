Cambodian newspapers published commentaries on the 8th and 9th, exposing the American subversion conspiracy against Cambodia.

The "People's News" editorial on the 9th pointed out that the American government cannot deny the collusion between American diplomats and Son Sann. The editorial said that the secret letter from the traitor Son Sann to Kellogg, the former political counselor of the American Embassy, is real and undeniable.

The newspaper went on to say that in the Siem Reap incident, Cambodian traitor Slat Peou admitted that he had obtained a transmitter from Victor Matsui, an employee of the American Embassy in Cambodia. Son Sann's letter shows that not only Kellogg, the former political counselor of the American Embassy, but also American Ambassador Trimble, had a relationship with Son Sann.

The newspaper said that the collusion between the American government and the Cambodian conspiracy group shows that they are forever the enemies of independence, peace, and neutrality in Cambodia, Indochina, and Asia. This is also a serious threat to the relationship between the United States and Cambodia and the easing of the Asian situation.

The "Cambodian Telegraph" said on the 8th that during Prince Sihanouk's absence from the country, some prominent Americans had contacted some "powerful" figures in Cambodia, asking them to join the conspiratorial group to overthrow Prince Sihanouk and change Cambodia's foreign policy to benefit the "free world." The newspaper said that this delusion cannot be realized because the policy of neutrality is an expression of the unwavering and indestructible will of all Cambodians.

    柬埔寨报纸谴责美国颠覆阴谋
    罪证如山赖不了
    本报综合报道　柬埔寨报纸在8、9两日发表评论，揭露美国对柬埔寨的颠覆阴谋。
    “人民报”9日的社论指出，美国政府是无法抵赖美国外交官同桑·萨里的勾结的。社论说，叛国分子桑·萨里给美国大使馆前政务参赞凯洛格的密信是确实的、是无法否认的。
    这家报纸接着说，在暹粒事件中，柬埔寨叛徒斯拉特·皮乌曾经承认，他从美国驻柬埔寨大使馆的职员维克托·松井那里得到一台发报机。桑·萨里的信件表明，不仅是美国大使馆前政务参赞凯洛格，而且连美国大使特林布耳也同桑·萨里有关系。
    这家报纸说，美国政府同柬埔寨阴谋集团的勾结表明，它们永远是柬埔寨、印度支那和亚洲地区的独立、和平和中立的敌人。这对于美国同柬埔寨的关系和亚洲局势的缓和来说，也是一个严重的威胁。
    “柬埔寨电讯报”8日说，在西哈努克亲王出国期间，一些美国著名人士曾经同柬埔寨的一些“有力”人物进行接触，要求他们参加阴谋者集团来打倒西哈努克亲王，修改柬埔寨的外交政策，以利于“自由世界”。报纸说，这种妄想决不能实现，因为，中立政策是全体柬埔寨人的不可动摇和不可摧毁的意志的表现。
