    Xinhua News Agency, February 25th. The Commercial Office of the Embassy of the German Democratic Republic in China held a press tea this afternoon, where Commercial Counselor Eichler briefed the Beijing press on the upcoming 1960 Leipzig Spring Fair.

    Eichler said that the 1960 Leipzig Spring Fair, which will begin on February 28, is of particular significance. Approximately 9,500 units from about 50 countries on five continents will participate in the fair, with a total exhibition area of 290,000 square meters. The exhibition area of the German Democratic Republic accounts for 194,000 square meters. In addition to the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet Union is the largest exhibitor among socialist countries, and China will participate in this fair. He said that one of the obvious characteristics of the current development of the Leipzig Fair is the increasingly enthusiastic participation of exhibitors and buyers from the young anti-imperialist national independent countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, which not only reflects the growth of these countries' foreign trade, but also illustrates that the relations between these countries and the German Democratic Republic are developing in a positive direction.

    He said that, as in previous springs, the 1960 Leipzig Spring Fair will focus on various industrial sectors, including machinery and instrument manufacturing, electrical engineering, automobile manufacturing, precision machinery, metallurgy, and heavy chemistry. Among the perfect international range, the industry of the German Democratic Republic, the world's fourth largest machine exporter, will profoundly demonstrate its production capacity.

    Eichler concluded by saying that the exhibition city is prepared to welcome the large number of visitors with a generally recognized good reception, and the Leipzig Spring Fair will also prepare comprehensive entertainment programs with a high level and with foreign actors for the fair guests. According to tradition, there will also be special concerts by the Radio Symphony Orchestra, performances by the Leipzig Thomaner Choir, concerts and performances by foreign soloists, conductors and song and dance troupes.

    德驻华大使馆商务专员指出
    今年来比锡春季博览会规模巨大
    新华社25日讯　德意志民主共和国驻中国大使馆商务处今天下午举行记者茶话会，由商务专员艾希勒向北京新闻界介绍了即将举行的1960年来比锡春季博览会的情况。
    艾希勒说，将在2月28日开始举行的1960年来比锡春季博览会，具有特别的意义。来自世界五大洲的约五十个国家的九千五百个单位将参加这次博览会，展览总面积有二十九万平方米。德意志民主共和国的展览面积占十九万四千平方米。除德意志民主共和国外，苏联是社会主义国家中最大展出者，中国将参加这次博览会。他说，来比锡博览会当前发展中的明显的特征之一是年青的亚非和拉丁美洲反帝民族独立国家的展出者和购买者愈来愈踊跃的参加，这不但反映了这些国家对外贸易发展的增长，而且也说明这些国家和德意志民主共和国的关系是在向着积极方面发展。
    他说，与往年春季一样，1960年来比锡春季博览会的重点将着重在各工业部门，其中包括机械和仪表制造、电工、汽车制造、精密机械、冶金和重化学等各部门。在完善的整个国际品种中，作为世界机器出口第四大国的德意志民主共和国的工业将深刻证明它的生产能力。
    艾希勒最后说，博览城准备以一致公认的良好的接待迎接即将来到的大批参观者，来比锡春季博览会也同样将为博览会来宾准备具有高度水平和有外国演员参加的全面的文娱节目。根据传统还将有广播交响乐团的特别音乐会、来比锡汤马诺合唱团的演唱、外国独唱家指挥和歌舞团的音乐会和访问演出。
