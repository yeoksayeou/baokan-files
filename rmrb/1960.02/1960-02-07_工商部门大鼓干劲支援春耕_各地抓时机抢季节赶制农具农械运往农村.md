The Industry and Commerce Departments Exert Great Effort to Support Spring Plowing
Various Locations Seize the Opportunity and Rush to Manufacture Agricultural Tools and Machinery for Transport to Rural Areas

    Zhejiang: 200,000 Handicraft Workers Go Deep into Communes to Repair Agricultural Tools

    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, February 6th: Agricultural machinery workers and handicraft workers in Zhejiang Province are rushing to manufacture and repair spring plowing agricultural tools to support the people's communes' spring plowing. As of now, the province has manufactured 7.88 million pieces of paddy plows, deep plows, rice transplanters, and various small agricultural tools, of which more than 2 million are new-style and improved agricultural tools; 4.79 million pieces of large and small agricultural tools have been repaired. Counties and cities such as Ningbo, Wenling, and Jiangshan, which have made faster progress, have now mostly completed the required manufacturing and repair of agricultural tools. Currently, more than 200,000 iron, wood, and bamboo handicraft workers across the province are going deep into production teams, working day and night to repair agricultural tools.

    Sichuan Rushes to Manufacture 180,000 Horsepower of Irrigation and Drainage Equipment
    Chongqing Expedites the Transfer of Production Materials to the Countryside

    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, February 5th: Agricultural machinery departments in Sichuan Province are seizing the opportunity and rushing to manufacture and assemble complete sets of irrigation and drainage equipment to support spring plowing production. Some of the newly manufactured, repaired, and assembled agricultural power irrigation and drainage equipment has already begun to be delivered to agricultural departments for use.

    Supplying agricultural departments with a large amount of irrigation and drainage equipment is one of the main measures taken by Sichuan Province to strengthen agricultural technical transformation and realize agricultural mechanization. Since last winter, Sichuan Province has experienced scarce rainfall, with some areas showing initial signs of drought. According to meteorological forecasts, rainfall in February to April this year will also be less than in the same period last year. Therefore, agricultural machinery departments have listed the production of irrigation and drainage equipment as an important task in supporting agricultural production. The initial plan for the whole year is to produce 300,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage equipment. The 180,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage equipment planned for production in the first quarter alone represents an increase of approximately 7 times compared to the horsepower of irrigation and drainage equipment delivered to agricultural departments last year. After this batch of irrigation and drainage equipment supplied for spring plowing is fully put into agricultural production, calculated at approximately 30 mu of land that can be irrigated per horsepower, it can save 720,000 laborers and irrigate 5.4 million mu of land.

    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, February 5th: Commercial departments in Chongqing City are seizing the time to organize and transfer production materials to support spring plowing production. A batch of farmland irrigation and drainage machinery, diesel engines, water pipes, sprayers, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, pushcarts, tires, and other tools have already been transferred to various parts of Sichuan. In the first quarter, a large number of diesel engines, gas engines, sprayers, water pumps, etc., will also be distributed to rural areas.

    This year, the demand for agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides in rural Sichuan has greatly increased, and commercial departments in Chongqing have particularly expanded the supply of these production materials. For example, the proportion of production materials managed by the Hardware, Machinery, Transportation, and Electrical Equipment Purchasing and Wholesale Station has increased from 30% last year to 50% this year, with a significant increase in power equipment and irrigation and drainage equipment. Commercial departments and relevant state-owned companies and wholesale stations have all established special offices to strengthen the organization and distribution of goods.

    Hubei Province Produces More Than 100,000 Agricultural Machinery Parts
    Zaoyang Proposes "Rather be 100 Days Early Than One Moment Late"

    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 6th: Agricultural machinery factories in Hubei Province are rushing to repair and assemble a batch of agricultural machinery to support the continued leap forward in agriculture. According to incomplete statistics, to date, the province has repaired more than 1,100 tractors and power irrigation and drainage machinery, and has also produced more than 44,000 tractor parts and more than 100,000 various power and agricultural machinery parts to support rural areas. Employees of agricultural machinery factories have expressed their determination to repair and assemble all agricultural machinery before spring plowing to ensure that agricultural timing is not missed.

    Many areas in Hubei Province have prioritized the repair and assembly of tractors and irrigation and drainage machinery since November last year. Due to early arrangements for repair and assembly tasks, farm tool factories in Yidu Prefecture's counties and communes have, on the one hand, fixed teams to be responsible for major and medium repairs in the factory, and on the other hand, organized mobile repair teams to go deep into the site with tools and parts for repairs, reducing the round-trip transportation of machines for minor repairs and parts replacement. Now, all but seven of the 115 tractors and irrigation and drainage machines in the district that need repair have been repaired, as the remaining seven machines are undergoing emergency repairs due to excessive wear and a lack of major parts. All of the more than 6,000 improved agricultural tools have also been repaired and assembled.

    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 5th: Since October last year, commercial departments in Zaoyang County, Hubei Province, have cooperated with industrial and agricultural departments to organize local sources of goods and reserve spring plowing production materials. According to statistics from mid-January, the total value of spring plowing production materials reserved reached 6.04 million yuan, accounting for 78% of the supply plan. Among them, there are more than 753,000 small agricultural tools, accounting for 80.8% of the planned supply.

    In October last year, the Zaoyang County Commerce Bureau put forward the slogan "Rather be 100 Days Early Than One Moment Late," requiring that the supply of spring plowing production materials in various places must be ahead of the production season. In early November, it held a meeting of store managers, adopting the method of "two checks, two calculations, and two searches" (calculate needs, check inventory; calculate the production season, check processing power; find experience, find lessons) to determine that more than 1.35 million spring plowing production tools were needed this year, but the inventory could only meet 30% of the needs.

    After the meeting, commercial employees throughout the county actively organized sources of goods based on the experience summarized at the meeting. With the assistance of the County Commerce Bureau, the Qifang Central Store cooperated with the agricultural department, on the one hand, developing mass self-production and self-use in production teams, and on the other hand, purchasing raw materials. Within ten days, it organized production teams to manufacture more than 210,000 various small agricultural tools and purchased more than 120,000 jin of raw materials. Stores throughout the county generally signed contracts with production teams to purchase surplus products, totaling more than 1.95 million iron, wood, and bamboo agricultural tools, of which more than 300,000 pieces have now been purchased. This not only secured a batch of agricultural tools but also increased the income of production teams and expanded agricultural investment. Under the leadership of party committees at all levels, commercial departments have generally strengthened cooperation with industry and handicrafts, helping industrial departments to add two lathes, two power machines, and more than 210,000 jin of raw materials, supporting the production of agricultural tools, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, etc. in various factories.

    Linfen Commercial Departments Find Sources of Goods Through Five Channels to Increase the Production of Agricultural Tools
    Xin Ding, Qin County, and Tai Gu Three Machinery Factories Launch Competition

    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, February 5th: Commercial departments in Linfen County, Shanxi Province, mainly relying on self-reliance, are using the "five channels to find sources of goods" method to organize a large amount of spring plowing production materials for supply to rural areas. The total value of agricultural production materials prepared by commercial departments throughout the county has reached 2.1 million yuan, accounting for 84% of the spring plowing needs.

    Their "five channels to find sources of goods" are: first, cooperating with industrial departments to find sources of goods from local industries. Various companies of the commercial department and the general supply and marketing cooperative have successively signed contracts with state-owned factories and factories run by communes to process agricultural machinery and various agricultural tools, and have helped factories solve problems related to raw materials and equipment, carry out technological innovations, and promote production development. Second, finding sources of goods from rural by-products, cooperating with agricultural departments, organizing the masses to mine black alum, weave cart fences, bamboo baskets, carrying baskets, twist straw ropes, and cut wooden handles, supplementing the shortage of production materials. Third, finding sources of goods from waste materials. Fourth, various departments within the commercial sector cooperate and adjust sources of goods among themselves. Fifth, carrying out regional cooperation and exchanging goods. Since November last year, the county commercial department has exchanged goods with more than 20 units in Taiyuan, Xiangning, and other places, adjusting a batch of materials and exchanging them for production materials worth a total of 350,000 yuan.

    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, February 6th: All employees of the First Machinery Factory of Xin Ding County, the Agricultural Machinery Repair Factory of Qin County, and the Machinery Manufacturing Factory of Tai Gu County, Shanxi Province, have set lofty ambitions and decided to launch a friendly competition to vigorously assist farmers in realizing agricultural technical transformation. Employees of the Agricultural Machinery Repair Factory in Qin County put forward ten indicators, stating that this year they will provide agricultural production and construction with 120 varieties totaling 120,000 pieces of agricultural machinery and tools, and cultivate 1,000 technical personnel of various types for rural areas. The employees of the First Machinery Factory of Xin Ding guarantee in this friendly competition that they will double the total output value this year and will also support the agricultural tool machinery repair factories of 20 communes in the county to realize mechanization and semi-mechanization. The Taigu Machinery Manufacturing Factory will produce 4,500 "Taigu Harvesters" and 2,000 water conservancy construction tools this year, and will also research and trial-produce cotton picking machines and corn threshing machines to arm the county's agricultural production. Currently, the employees of the three factories are redoubling their efforts to complete these plans.

    Changde Prefecture Has Established Nearly Two Thousand Agricultural Tool Repair Stations

    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, February 6th: Commercial departments in Changde Prefecture, Hunan Province, under the leadership of the Party Committee, have launched a high tide of supporting spring plowing production. Due to early action, to date, the total value of production materials such as fertilizers, seeds, machinery, new agricultural tools, and small agricultural tools sold by commercial departments has increased more than twofold compared to the same period last year. All irrigation and drainage machinery that needs repair in the prefecture has also been fully repaired through industry and commerce cooperation.

    The 1,997 agricultural tool repair stations and 2,650 mobile teams established by commercial departments to assist various people's communes have adopted the method of dividing areas and contracting, inspecting, repairing, and supplying parts simultaneously, manufacturing and rushing to repair more than 14 million various small iron, wood, and bamboo agricultural tools in advance, which has basically met the needs of spring plowing production. Commercial departments throughout the prefecture have also dispatched more than 6,000 cadres to cooperate with industrial, agricultural, and other relevant departments to conduct a comprehensive inspection of lime factories, soil fertilizer factories, and pesticide factories run by counties, communes, and production brigades, helping them to expand production to meet the needs of spring plowing. Currently, there are more than 5,500 soil pesticide factories in production throughout the prefecture, producing 660,000 dan of soil pesticides.

    工商部门大鼓干劲支援春耕
    各地抓时机抢季节赶制农具农械运往农村
    浙江二十万手工业者深入公社修农具
    据新华社杭州6日电　浙江省各地农业机械工人和手工业工人赶制赶修春耕农具，支援人民公社春耕。截至目前止，全省已制造出水田犁、深耕犁、插秧机以及各种小农具七百八十八万件，其中有二百多万件是新式农具和改良农具；修理好大小农具四百七十九万件。进度较快的宁波、温岭、江山等县、市，需要制造和修理的农具现在已大部完成。现在，全省有二十多万铁、木、竹手工业工人深入生产队，日夜赶修农具。
    四川赶制十八万马力排灌设备
    重庆及早调运生产资料下乡
    据新华社成都5日电　四川省农业机械部门抓时机、抢季节，赶制和修配成套排灌设备，支援春耕生产。现在，有一部分新造、修理和配套的部分农业动力排灌设备，已经开始交付农业部门使用。
    供应农业部门大量排灌设备，是四川省加强农业技术改造、实现农业机械化的主要措施之一。去年入冬以来，四川省雨量稀少，部分地区初露旱象；同时，根据气象预报，今年2至4月份降雨量也都将比去年同期少。因此，农业机械部门把生产排灌设备列为当前支援农业生产的重要任务。全年初步计划生产三十万马力的排灌设备，仅全省第一季度计划生产的十八万马力的排灌设备，就比去年交付农业部门使用的排灌设备马力增长7倍左右。这批供应春耕的排灌设备全部投入农业生产后，以每一马力约可灌溉田三十亩计算，即可节约劳力七十二万个，灌溉五百四十万亩田地。
    据新华社重庆5日电　重庆市商业部门及早抓紧组织和调运生产资料，支援春耕生产。目前已经调运一批农田排灌机械、柴油机、水管、喷雾器、化肥、农药、架架车、轮胎以及其他工具到四川各地。在第一季度内，还有大批柴油机、煤气机、喷雾器、水泵等下放农村。
    今年，四川农村需要的农业机械、化肥、农药的数量又大大增加了，重庆商业部门特别扩大了这些生产资料的供应量。如五金机械交通电工器材采购批发站，今年经营生产资料的比重，由去年的30％扩大到50％，其中动力设备和排灌设备增加很多。商业部门和有关的国营公司、批发站都成立了专门办公室，加强货源的组织和分配工作。
    湖北省制成十几万件农业机械配件
    枣阳提出“宁早百天，不迟一时”
    据新华社武汉6日电　湖北省各地农业机械厂赶修赶配出一批农业机械，支援农业继续跃进。据不完全的统计，到目前为止，全省已修复拖拉机、动力排灌机械一千一百多台，还生产了四万四千多件拖拉机配件，十余万件各种动力和农业机械配件，支援了各地农村。各农业机械厂职工纷纷表示一定要在春耕前把所有的农业机械都修配好，保证不误农时。
    湖北省不少地区从去年11月间就把拖拉机和排灌机械的修配放在首位。宜都地区各县、社农具厂由于提早安排了修配任务，一方面固定班子留厂负责大中修理；另一方面组织巡回修理组，带工具和配件深入现场修理，减少了小修小配机子的往返运输。现在，全区需要修理的一百一十五台拖拉机和排灌机械，除七台因磨损太大，缺少重大配件，正在抢修以外，其余已全部修复，六千多台改良农具也全部修配好。
    据新华社武汉5日电　湖北枣阳县商业部门从去年10月份起就同工业、农业部门协作，组织地方货源，储备春耕生产资料。到1月中旬的统计，储备的春耕生产资料总金额达六百零四万元，占供应计划的78％。其中，小型农具就有七十五万三千多件，占计划供应数的80．8％。
    枣阳县商业局在去年10月份提出“宁早百天，不迟一时”的口号，要求各地春耕生产资料供应工作必须走在生产季节的前面。11月上旬又召开各商店经理会议，采取“两查两算两找”（算需要、查库存，算生产季节、查加工力量，找经验、找教训）的方法，查算出今年需要春耕生产工具一百三十五万多件，而库存只能满足需要30％。
    会后，全县商业职工便根据会议总结的经验，积极动手组织货源。七方中心商店在县商业局的帮助下，同农业部门协作，一面到生产队发展群众自产自用，一面收购原料，在十天内就组织生产队制造了各种小型农具二十一万多件，收购原料十二万多斤。全县各地商店普遍与生产队签订了多余产品收购合同，共计收购铁木竹农具一百九十五万多件，现在已收购三十多万件，这样不仅掌握了一批农具，而且使生产队增加收入，扩大了农业投资。在各级党委领导下，商业部门又普遍同工业、手工业加强协作，帮助工业部门增加了两台车床、两部动力机器、二十一万多斤原料，支援了各工厂的农具、化肥、农药等生产。
    临汾商业部门五路找货源增产农具
    忻定、沁县、太谷三机械厂开展竞赛
    据新华社太原5日电　山西省临汾县商业部门以自力更生为主，用“五路找货源”的办法，大量组织春耕生产资料，供应农村。全县商业部门目前已经准备好的农业生产资料总值达二百一十万元，占春耕需要量的84％。
    他们的“五路找货源”，第一是同工业部门协作，向地方工业找货源。商业部门各公司和供销总店，先后同各国营工厂和公社办的工厂签订了加工农业机械和各种农具的合同，并且帮助工厂解决原料材料和设备方面的问题，开展技术革新，促进生产发展。第二是向农村副产品找货源，同农业部门协作，组织群众挖黑矾，编织车笆、箩头、抬筐，拧草绳，砍木把，补充了生产资料的不足。第三是向废旧材料找货源。第四是商业内部各部门协作，互相调剂货源。第五是开展地区协作，互通有无。从去年11月份以来，县商业部门先后同太原、乡宁等地的二十多个单位互通有无，调剂出一批物资，换回总值三十五万元的生产资料。
    据新华社太原6日电　山西省忻定县第一机械厂、沁县农业机械修造厂、太谷县机械制造厂全体职工立下雄心大志，决定开展友谊竞赛，大力协助农民兄弟实现农业技术改造。沁县农业机械修造厂的职工提出了十项指标，今年要为农业生产建设提供一百二十个品种共十二万件农业机具，并为农村培养各种技术人才一千人。忻定第一机械厂的职工在这场友谊竞赛中，保证要使今年的总产值翻一番，还将支援全县二十个公社的农具机械修配厂实现机械化和半机械化。太谷机械制造厂今年要生产四千五百台“太谷号收割机”和二千件水利工施工工具，还要研究试制收棉花机和玉米脱粒机，武装全县的农业生产。目前，三个厂的职工正在为完成这些计划而加倍努力。
    常德专区已建立农具修配站近两千
    据新华社长沙6日电　湖南省常德专区各地商业部门在党委领导下掀起了支援春耕生产的高潮。由于动手早，到目前止，商业部门销售的肥料、种子、机械、新式农具和小型农具等生产资料的总金额，已比去年同期增加了两倍多。全区需要修理的排灌机械，经工商协作，也已经全部修好了。
    商业部门协助各人民公社建立的一千九百九十七个农具修配站、二千六百五十个流动组，采取分片包干，边检查、边修配、边供应零件的办法，提早制造和赶修了各种铁木竹小农具一千四百多万件，已基本满足春耕生产的需要。全区商业部门还先后派出六千多干部，配合工业、农业等有关部门，对县、公社、生产大队办的石灰厂、土化肥厂、农药厂，进行一次全面检查，帮助它们扩大生产，以适应春耕的需要。目前全区已投入生产的土农药厂有五千五百多个，生产了土农药六十六万担。
