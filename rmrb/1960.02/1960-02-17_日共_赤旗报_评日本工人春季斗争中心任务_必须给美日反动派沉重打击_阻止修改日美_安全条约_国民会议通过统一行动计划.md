Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 16th: The "Akahata," the organ of the Japanese Communist Party, published an editorial today, emphasizing the importance of combining the Japanese workers' spring struggle with the struggle to prevent the ratification of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The editorial pointed out that by signing the new "Security Treaty," Japanese monopoly capital openly demonstrated its ambition to rely on the United States and revive imperialism and militarism. Their touted "Japan-U.S. economic cooperation" can only solidify Japan's economic dependence on the United States and further intensify the exploitation of the working class. At the same time, Japan's state power has become even more reactionary.

The editorial condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government and Japanese monopoly capital for plotting to separate the Japanese workers' spring struggle from political struggle, thereby undermining the national unified action to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

The editorial emphasized that it is entirely correct for the spring struggle to take the crushing of the U.S.-Japan "Security System" as its central goal. The editorial discussed that the unified demands put forward by workers in the spring struggle include raising wages and safeguarding the democratic rights of workers, and guiding unorganized workers, the unemployed, and all other working people into this common struggle.

The editorial also pointed out the significance of emphatically raising the demands to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations and strive for comprehensive disarmament in the unified demands.

The editorial said that in this spring struggle, the Japanese working class will gather all its strength to launch unified action and long-term struggle until the goal is achieved.

The editorial emphasized that guiding this spring struggle to victory is closely related to promoting the unified action of the Japanese people's struggle to prevent ratification and strive for the abolition of the new "Security Treaty." Therefore, it is necessary to direct the spearhead of this spring struggle against Japanese monopoly capital and U.S. imperialism, and move towards the establishment of a national democratic united front.

The editorial pointed out that the Japanese Communist Party will, in accordance with the decisions of the Sixth and Eighth Plenary Sessions of the JCP Central Committee, strive for the victory of the coal miners' struggle against layoffs, and strive to strengthen the unity of trade union organizations and enhance trade union power in the spring struggle.

The editorial further pointed out that the workers' spring struggle is the core force for preventing the ratification and striving for the abolition of the new "Security Treaty." In this struggle, a heavy blow must be dealt to U.S. imperialism, Japanese monopoly capital, and the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, thereby preventing the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," forcing the dissolution of the Diet, and overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 15th: The National Conference to Prevent Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" held a meeting of executive secretaries today, and adopted a concrete plan for the 13th National Unified Action to be held on March 19th.

The plan stipulates that on the 13th, the National Conference will hold a rally and demonstration in Tokyo with the participation of 100,000 people, and will also petition the Diet to oppose the ratification of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." Joint struggle organizations in various prefectures will send representatives to Tokyo to participate in this action.

The meeting decided that in order to win the victory of the 13th National Unified Action, the National Conference will invite leaders from all walks of life in Japan to participate in the work of collecting signatures against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" at the end of this month, and will convene a meeting of representatives from trade unions, peace organizations, cultural groups, religious groups, and other organizations in early March to further unite the ranks against the new "Security Treaty."

Prior to the 13th National Unified Action, the 12th National Unified Action will be held on February 25th, and various groups participating in the National Conference will also launch a series of activities against the new "Security Treaty."

The Tokyo Joint Struggle Conference for the Defense of Peace and Democracy is scheduled to hold a demonstration against the new "Security Treaty" around March 10th; the Women's Association for the Defense of Human Rights has decided to convene a rally against the new "Security Treaty" in Tokyo on March 5th; the Tokyo Metropolitan Federation of the Socialist Party will hold a general mobilization rally with the participation of 3,000 people on March 6th to oppose the Diet's ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

    日共“赤旗报”评日本工人春季斗争中心任务
    必须给美日反动派沉重打击
    阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议通过统一行动计划
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，强调把日本工人春季斗争和阻止批准新日美“安全条约”斗争结合起来进行的重要意义。
    社论指出，日本垄断资本通过签订新“安全条约”，公开表明了它们依附美国，复活帝国主义和军国主义的野心。它们所鼓吹的“日美经济合作”只能使日本在经济上依附美国的地位固定下来并且更进一步加强对工人阶级的剥削。同时，日本的国家权力也更加反动。
    社论谴责岸信介政府和日本垄断资本阴谋使日本工人的春季斗争脱离政治斗争，从而破坏阻止批准新“安全条约”的全国统一行动。
    社论强调指出，春季斗争把粉碎日美“安全体系”作为中心目标是完全正确的。社论谈到工人在春季斗争中提出统一要求的内容包括提高工资和维护工人的民主权利以及把尚未组织起来的工人、失业者和其他一切劳动人民都引导到这一共同斗争里来。
    社论还指出了统一要求中着重提出打开日中关系僵局和争取全面裁军的要求的意义。
    社论说，在这次春季斗争中，日本工人阶级将汇集全部力量展开统一行动和长期斗争，直到达到目的为止。
    社论强调指出，把这次春季斗争导向胜利同推动日本人民阻止批准和争取废除新“安全条约”斗争的统一行动有着密切的关系。因此，必须促使这次春季斗争的矛头针对日本垄断资本和美帝国主义，走向建立民族民主统一战线。
    社论指出，日本共产党将根据日共六中全会和八中全会的决定，为争取煤矿工人反对解雇斗争的胜利而努力，并且在春季斗争中努力加强工会组织的统一和增强工会力量。
    社论进一步指出，工人春季斗争是阻止批准和争取废除新“安全条约”的统一行动的核心力量，必须在这个斗争中给予美帝国主义、日本垄断资本和岸信介内阁以沉重打击，进而阻止批准新“安全条约”、迫使解散国会、打倒岸信介内阁。
    新华社15日讯　东京消息：日本阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议今天举行干事会议，通过了在3月19日举行的第十三次全国统一行动的具体计划。
    计划规定，13日国民会议将在东京举行有十万人参加的大会和示威游行，并且要到国会进行请愿，反对批准新日美“安全条约”。各县共同斗争组织将派代表到东京参加这一行动。
    会议决定，为了争取第十三次全国统一行动的胜利，国民会议将在本月底请日本各界领袖到街头上参加征集反对批准新“安全条约”的签名的工作，并且在3月初旬召集工会、和平、文化、宗教等各界团体代表举行会议，进一步团结反对新“安全条约”的队伍。
    在举行第十三次全国统一行动以前，将在2月25日举行第十二次全国统一行动，参加国民会议的各团体还将展开一系列的活动，反对新“安全条约”。
    东京维护和平与民主共同斗争会议预定在3月10日左右举行反对新“安全条约”的示威游行；妇女维护人权协议会决定3月5日在东京召开反对新“安全条约”的集会；社会党东京都联合会将在3月6日举行有三千人参加的总奋起大会，反对国会批准新“安全条约”。
