Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 9th: The Central Executive Committee of the Burmese Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL) issued a statement today saying that the Sino-Burmese agreement on border issues and the conclusion of the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression are not only conducive to peace and friendship between the two countries, but also in line with the principles of the Bandung Conference and conducive to world peace.

The AFPFL, which firmly supports the conclusion of the Sino-Burmese agreement on border issues and the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression, stated in its statement that "the provisions contained in the agreement and the treaty resolve the Sino-Burmese border issue that has been pending for a century."

The statement pointed out that the agreement and treaty signed by Burmese Prime Minister Ne Win and Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai stipulate mutual recognition of each other's national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. The treaty stipulates that any disputes between Burma and China will be resolved through peaceful consultation, not through the use of force. The statement also said that because the contracting parties do not engage in aggressive actions against each other, do not participate in military alliances, and guarantee the development of economic and cultural relations between the two countries, Burma and China will conduct friendly cooperation.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 9th: The Burmese Committee for the Defence of World Peace issued a statement today saying that the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression and the agreement on border issues signed between China and Burma "reaffirm and strengthen the principles of peaceful coexistence, therefore this is a matter for rejoicing."

The statement emphasized that friendly and harmonious relations between neighboring countries are a sign of world peace. The statement said that the Sino-Burmese agreement on border issues demonstrates the resolution of border issues through peaceful means without the use of force; the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression is a guarantee that there will be no war between the two countries. Therefore, this treaty and agreement reassure the people of Burma and China who desire peace.

The statement pointed out that since there are still activities such as organizing military alliances and concluding military agreements that exacerbate world tensions, Article 3 of the treaty clearly stipulates that neither contracting party shall engage in any aggressive activities against the other, nor participate in any military alliance against the other, which eliminates a cause of exacerbating world tensions.

The statement concluded, "The Sino-Burmese treaty and agreement are warmly welcomed as a sign of strengthened friendship between neighboring countries, cooperation between countries, and world peace."

    缅甸廉洁的反法西斯人民自由同盟发表声明
    中缅条约有利于两国友谊和世界和平
    缅甸保卫世界和平委员会认为条约加强了和平共处原则
    新华社仰光9日电　廉洁的反法西斯人民自由同盟中央执行委员会今天发表声明说，中缅关于边界问题的协定以及友好和互不侵犯条约的缔结，不但有利于两国间的和平和友谊，而且是符合万隆会议的原则和有助于世界和平的。
    坚决支持缔结中缅关于边界问题的协定以及友好和互不侵犯条约的廉洁的反法西斯人民自由同盟在声明中说，“协定和条约所包含的条款，解决了百年来悬而未决的中缅边界问题。”
    声明指出，缅甸总理奈温和中国总理周恩来所签订的协定和条约规定，互相承认彼此的国家独立、主权和领土完整。条约规定，缅甸和中国之间发生的任何争端，将用和平协商的办法解决，而不诉诸武力。声明又说，由于缔约国双方不进行针对对方的侵略行动，不参加军事联盟，并且保证发展两国之间的经济和文化关系，缅甸和中国将进行友好合作。
    新华社仰光9日电　缅甸保卫世界和平委员会今天发表声明说，中缅两国签订的友好和互不侵犯条约以及关于边界问题的协定“再次肯定和加强了和平共处的原则，因此这是一件值得高兴的事。”
    声明着重指出，邻国间的友好融洽的关系是世界和平的一种迹象。声明说，中缅关于边界问题的协定表明不用武力而通过和平途径解决边界问题；中缅友好和互不侵犯条约是一种保证，因为两国间将不发生战争。因此，这项条约和协定使希望和平的缅中两国人民安下心来。
    声明指出，由于目前仍然有加剧世界紧张局势的组织军事同盟和缔结军事协定这样的活动，条约第三条明确规定缔约的一方不得对另一方进行任何侵略活动，不得参加针对另一方的任何军事同盟，这就消除了加剧世界紧张局势的一个原因。
    声明最后说，“中缅条约和协定被认为是邻国间友谊的加强、国家间的合作以及世界和平的迹象而受到热烈欢迎。”
