    Master of the Water
    ——An Account of Fu Zhengguo, A Skilled Worker Who Utilizes Water Power for Processing
    By Our Reporter Tian Zhuang

    In the mountain ridges of Yunxi County, beside the gurgling canals, houses are scattered here and there. Inside these houses are mills, grinders, sieves, winnowing machines, hullers… A large waterwheel spins joyfully, welcoming the flowing water. If you want to grind flour, you just pour the wheat into the mill; without lifting a finger, the crushed wheat automatically enters the sieve and then returns to the mill… If you want to husk rice, just pour the grain into the huller; before long, the grain rolls from the chute onto the grinding stone, and from there it goes to the winnowing machine, where it is fanned into pure white rice. The entire operation of a mill requires only two people, and it can grind 1,200 catties of flour or husk 7,300 catties of rice per day. Locals call this type of mill a "one-drive-five-carry" (meaning one wooden waterwheel drives five processing tools). Besides grain processing, papermaking, oil pressing, sawing wood, weaving cloth, cotton ginning, and other tasks are now being done by water. People have truly become the masters of water!

        The Water Mill Gets Busy

    Yunxi County is a large mountainous area with abundant water resources. However, people only truly became the masters of water not long ago. When mentioning this, people will think of Fu Zhengguo, a skilled worker who utilizes water power for processing. It was back in the summer of 1956 when the agricultural cooperation movement, like a spring breeze, swept into the mountainous area of Yunxi. The mutual aid team where Fu Zhengguo was located joyfully built the Chengfeng Agricultural Cooperative. As soon as the cooperative was established, everyone was troubled by one thing: the Chengfeng Cooperative, with its seventy-plus households, only had one water-powered mill, left over from who knows what dynasty. When they were working individually, everyone was used to turning a small mill in the summer and using a mortar and pestle in the winter. Now that they had joined the cooperative, who would want to spend their time on manual grinding and milling? As a result, that water mill became extremely busy, often with a crowd of ten or twenty people surrounding it before dawn. One day, Old Fu finished work and it was pitch dark. He was terribly hungry, thinking he could have a hearty meal as soon as he got home. Who knew that his wife hadn’t even started cooking, which made Old Fu furious. At that moment, his wife started grumbling, “You only know how to eat, but you don’t know how hard it is to push the mill!” Actually, Old Fu had already seen all of this and was thinking: If the cooperative could get another water-powered mill, how much labor could be saved every day! After finishing his meal, he wiped his mouth and rushed to the cooperative management committee to share his plans. The cooperative was also planning to get a water-powered mill, and upon hearing Old Fu's idea, they decided to assign him the task. After accepting the assignment, Old Fu spent day and night observing the water flow, selecting the terrain, drawing designs, and making wooden wheels. In just a few days, as the water-powered mill was about to be completed, he started to worry again: The problem of eating flour in the summer is solved, but won’t it be difficult to eat rice in the autumn! He thought about building the millhouse two stories high, with the mill upstairs and the grinder downstairs, wouldn’t that be “one-drive-two-carry”?

    Grinding Flour and Milling Rice

    About ten miles away from the Chengfeng Cooperative was the Yingdong Agricultural Cooperative. This cooperative, with its hundred-plus households, had to use more than twenty head of cattle and thirty-plus people every day for grinding flour and milling rice. They originally felt that the manpower and animal power for production were insufficient, and this made the shortage even more apparent. That year, the entire cooperative's 296 mu of paddy fields took a full 58 days to transplant. The cooperative members were in a frenzy of anxiety, and the branch secretary, Hu Shaoyu, was even more worried. At this time, he heard that Old Fu could make water-powered mills, so he personally went to the Chengfeng Cooperative to ask Old Fu for help. Old Fu agreed without hesitation. He finished his work during the day and then ran more than ten miles to the Yingdong Cooperative at night to help build the water-powered mill. The terrain was good here, and the water flow was strong. Old Fu's original plan to build a "one-drive-two-carry" (simultaneously driving a mill and a grinder) idea came to his mind. He discussed this matter with Hu Shaoyu. When Old Hu heard that a single water source could be used to grind flour and mill rice, he was very happy and encouraged Old Fu to be bold and promised to provide whatever he needed.

    After Old Fu decided to build a "one-drive-two-carry," he became obsessed with it. He didn't return to his cooperative for several days, which angered the cooperative director, Fu Wensheng. He said, "If he doesn't come back, he shouldn't expect work points, and he shouldn't plan on receiving food rations!" At this time, some members of the Yingdong Cooperative also didn't quite believe that Old Fu could achieve "one-drive-two-carry." They said: A mill does milling, and a grinder does grinding, putting them together is like a dragon and tiger fighting, how can it be done? Old Fu's wife also advised him to "forget about it." At this time, Old Fu's mind was also struggling. However, when he thought about using water to grind flour and mill rice, freeing up hands to accelerate the change of the poor mountain valley, the blood in his whole body boiled and he could never calm down. With the help of Hu Shaoyu, he finally overcame the ridicule and difficulties from all sides and finally built the "one-drive-two-carry."

    Difficult Experiments

    "Old Fu, do you think it's possible to add a huller and make it 'one-drive-three-carry'?" During the Spring Festival of 1958, Hu Shaoyu came to visit him again.

    "Yes," Old Fu's tone was very affirmative.

    "Do you have time?"

    Old Fu had always been efficient in doing things; he would do it as soon as he said it. At this time, he stood up, took a "five-foot" (a type of ruler used by carpenters), and said, "Let's go!" He was about to leave. The old woman beside him looked at the dark sky, the piercing north wind blowing tightly, and then looked at Old Fu, who was not very strong, and said, "It's not too late to do it in a few days!" Old Fu said, "In a few days, there will be more work." He pulled Old Hu and rushed to the Yingdong Cooperative overnight.

    The next day, installation began. As a result, the huller's mouth was open, it wouldn't close, and it wouldn't rotate. He thought, if he used a belt, one end attached to the millstone and the other end attached to the huller, wouldn't the huller rotate as the mill rotated? Unexpectedly, the millstone was large and the huller was small. When the water rushed, the millstone rotated once, and the huller had to rotate more than ten times, and the huller jumped violently. He saw that one side had been hulled into powder, and the other side hadn't even broken the husk. The experiment failed. He then installed a round plate the size of the huller under the millstone and used a belt to drive the lower fan of the huller. However, as soon as it was installed and tested, with a whoosh, it pulled a basket of wheat from a female cooperative member, Lu Cifeng, who was grinding flour, and squeezed it into a mess in the belt disk, which made Lu Cifeng jump up and down in anger.

    Don't Be Afraid of Failure

    Where was the problem? Old Fu fell into deep thought. These days, he had hardly slept well, his eyes were bloodshot, and his thin face looked even thinner. At this moment, Sun Longzhang, the first secretary of the county party committee, came. He encouraged Old Fu and said, "Don't be afraid of failure!" And he promised to transfer two experienced craftsmen from the county seat to help him continue the experiment. At this moment, Old Fu's eyes lit up again, and his courage became stronger. One day, as soon as it dawned, Old Fu ran silently to the county seat. He spent most of the day looking at all the machine processing factories in the city. He found that the cotton ginning machine, the cotton ginning machine, and the noodle rolling machine all used gears to rotate. After returning, he began to think about it. At night, under the dim light, large gears and small gears were drawn all over the wall, calculating how many turns the small gear should turn when the large gear turns once. The next day, he began to make wooden wheels with teeth. Unexpectedly, as soon as the gears were installed, with a crack, the huller's spindle broke. Old Fu was sweating anxiously. After a careful look, he found that the vertical wheel and the horizontal wheel were not in the same groove. In this way, he failed four times in a row, and finally succeeded on the fifth time. He also installed a winnowing machine and a sieve according to the requirements of the cooperative members, so that all the processes of rice and flour processing were replaced by water power.

    Solving the Problem

    Comrade Fu Zhengguo's deeds, like having grown wings, spread throughout the entire Yunxi mountainous area, and people came to visit from all over. Sun Longzhang, the first secretary of the county party committee, also came to the Yingdong Cooperative. In addition to highly praising Old Fu's creative spirit, he also put forward a new hope.

    "From grain to rice, from wheat to flour, without people reaching out, completely automated, can it be done?"

    "Yes!" Seeing that the county party secretary was so concerned, Old Fu replied with great enthusiasm. However, how could it be done? Secretary Sun seemed to see Old Fu's thoughts, so he encouraged him and said, "Just try it!"

    This was really a difficult problem! To be honest, Old Fu hadn't thought about this matter before. However, he asked himself again, "Wasn't 'one-drive-three-carry' something he hadn't thought about before?" With the support of the Party, what difficulties can't be overcome? So, he became obsessed again, thinking about it while eating, thinking about it while sleeping, and thinking about it while walking. He asked Master Li Kaikun, an old carpenter, for advice. Old Li advised him to go to the rice and flour processing factory in the county seat to take a look. This brightened his mind. The next day, he invited Li Kaikun to visit the county seat together. After returning, he imitated and trial-produced elevators and transporters. After several improvements, the first water-powered automatic processing factory was born in Yunxi County.

    作水的主人
    ——记利用水力加工的能手傅正国
    本报记者　田庄
    在郧西县的山梁上，哗哗流水的渠道旁，隔不远就有一栋房子，这房子里安着磨、碾、箩、风车、砻子……，一只大水轮迎着流水欢快地转动着。要想磨面，你只要把麦子往磨上一倒，不用伸手，碎麦就自动地走进箩里，然后又回转到磨上……。要想碾米，只要把谷子倒在砻子上，不大工夫，谷子便从滑槽滚到了碾盘上，从那里再转到风车里一搧，就成了白花花的大米。一个磨房的全部操作只要两个人，一天能够磨面一千二百来斤，碾米七千三百多斤。当地人管这种磨房叫“一打五带”（即一个木水轮带动五种加工工具）。除了粮食加工以外，造纸、榨油、锯木、织布、弹棉花等活，现在都让水去干了。人，这才真正成了水的主人！
        水磨忙起来了
    郧西县是个大山区，水源丰富。但是，人们真正成为水的主人，只是不久前的事情。一提起这些，人们就会想起利用水力加工的能手傅正国。那还是1956年夏天，农业合作化运动像春风一样吹进了郧西山区。傅正国所在的互助组欢天喜地地建成了成丰农业社。社一建成，可有件事儿苦恼着大家：成丰社七十多户人家，只有一盘水打磨，不知道是哪朝哪代留下来的。单干时，夏天拐小磨，冬天抱碓窝，大家没说的。现在进了社，谁愿意成天把工夫花在人工磨面碾米上？这样一来，那盘水磨可就忙起来了，经常是天不见亮就围上一、二十人。有一天，老傅收罢工，天黑尽了，肚子饿的不行，本想到家就可以吃一餐饱饭，谁知一进门老伴还没有把饭做好，急的老傅火直冒。这时候，他的老伴却唠叨开了：“你光知道吃，可不知推磨多么难！”其实，这一切老傅早就看在眼里，而且寻思着：社里要能再弄个水打磨，每天该省下多少劳动力！吃罢饭，他把嘴一抹，拔腿到了社管理委员会，说出了自己的打算。社里也正盘算着搞个水打磨，听老傅说了，就决定把这件事交给他去办。老傅接受任务后，不分日夜看水势，选地形，画图样，制木轮。没几天，眼看水打磨就要成功，他心里又嘀咕开了：夏天吃面问题解决啦，秋天吃米还不是作难！他想把这磨房盖两层，上面支磨，下面安碾，岂不是“一打两带”。
    磨面又碾米
    离成丰社十几里路有个迎东农业社，这个社一百多户人家，每天为了磨面碾米得用二十多头牛、三十多个人。原来就感到生产上的人力、畜力不足，这样一来，人力畜力就显得更不足了。这一年，全社二百九十六亩水田，整整花了五十八天才插完秧。社员们急得团团转，支部书记胡少虞更是焦急不安。这时他听到老傅会做水打磨，便亲自到成丰社去找老傅帮忙。老傅是一口答应下了，他白天干完活，晚上再跑到十里以外的迎东社，帮助搞水打磨。这里地形好，水势大，老傅原来计划搞“一打两带”（同时带动磨和碾）的想法，涌上心头。他跟胡少虞商量这件事。老胡一听说可以用一股水既推面又碾米，高兴得很，鼓励老傅大胆干，保证要什么给什么。
    老傅决定搞“一打两带”以后，就迷在这上头了，他一连好几天没有回社去，这下可把社主任傅文升气坏啦。他说：“不回来，就别想要工分，也别打算分口粮！”这时候，迎东社有些社员也不大相信老傅能做到“一打两带”，他们说：磨做磨推，碾做碾磙，弄到一块龙虎相斗，咋搞得成？老傅的老伴也劝他“死了那个心”。这时，老傅思想也在斗争。但是，一想到叫水磨面、碾米，腾出手来加快改变穷山沟的面貌，他全身的血就沸腾起来，总也不能平静。在胡少虞的帮助下，他终于顶住来自各方面的讥笑和困难，终于搞成了“一打两带”。
    艰苦的试验
    “老傅，你看加盘砻子，搞‘一打三带’行吗？”1958年春节，胡少虞又来拜访他。
    “行”，老傅的语气非常肯定。
    “你有空吗？”
    老傅从来做事干净利索，说干就干。这时，他站起来拿了“五尺”（木匠用的一种尺子），说声：“走吧！”拔腿就要出门。正在一旁的老伴，看看漆黑黑的天空，尖溜溜的北风刮得正紧，又看看身子骨不太结实的老傅，便说：“过几天再搞也不迟呀！”老傅说：“过几天，活就多啦。”拉着老胡连夜赶到了迎东社。
    第二天，安装开始了。结果，砻子是个张嘴货，合不拢，不转圈。他想，如果用一根皮带，一头套在磨盘上，一头套在砻子上，磨一转动，砻子不就跟着转动吗？不料磨盘大砻子小，水一冲，磨盘转一圈，砻子就要转十几圈，而且砻子跳得厉害。一看，一边砻成了粉，另一边连壳都没破。试验失败了。他又在磨盘下面安了个和砻子大小的圆盘，再用皮带带动砻子的下扇，可是，这样刚安上一试，呼啦一下，把正在磨面的女社员芦赐凤的一箩筐麦子，带进皮带盘里挤了个稀烂，气得芦赐凤又蹦又跳。
    不能怕失败
    问题在哪里呢？老傅陷入沉思中。这些日子，他几乎没有好好睡过觉，眼睛里网上了血丝，消瘦的脸显得更瘦了。正在这时候，县委第一书记孙龙章同志来了，他鼓励老傅说：“不能怕失败！”并且答应从县城里调两个老师傅帮助他继续试验。这一下，老傅的眼睛又亮了，胆子又壮起来了。一天，天麻麻亮，老傅不吭声地跑到了县城，用了大半天时间，把城里所有的机器加工厂看了一遍，他发现弹花柜、轧花机、轧面机都是利用齿轮转动的。回来后，他就琢磨开了。晚上，在昏黄的灯光下，大齿轮、小齿轮画满了一墙，计算着大齿轮转一圈，小齿轮该转多少圈。第二天，他便开始做起有齿的木轮来。不料齿轮刚安上，一转动，咔嚓一声，砻子的轴心断了。老傅急得直冒汗，仔细一看，原来是立轮和卧轮不合槽。就是这样，连续失败四次，到第五次终于成功了。他又根据社员们的要求，安装了风车和箩，使米面加工的几道工序全部用水力代替了。
    解开难题
    傅正国同志的事迹，像长上了翅膀，传遍了整个郧西山区，各地来参观的人往来不断。县委第一书记孙龙章，也来到迎东社，他除了对老傅的创造精神大加赞扬以外，又提出了一个新的希望。
    “从谷到米，从麦到面，不用人伸手，全部自动化，做得到吗？”
    “做得到！”看到县委书记这样关心，老傅劲头十足地回答说。但是，怎样才能做到呢？孙书记好像看出了老傅的心思，便鼓励说：“就试试看吧！”
    这真是个难题啊！说实话，这件事过去老傅还没想过。可是，他又反问自己：“一打三带”不是也没想过吗？有党的支持，啥困难不能克服？于是，他又像着了迷一样，吃饭在想，睡觉在想，走路也在想。他向老木工李开坤师傅求教，李老头劝他到县城里米面加工厂去看看。这下他心里亮了。第二天，他邀李开坤一块到县城去参观，回来便仿照试制升降机和运输机，经过几次改进，第一个水力自动加工厂，在郧西县诞生了。
