Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Mass sports activities are developing daily in the German Democratic Republic. Currently, people can be seen everywhere engaging in activities that suit their physical condition.

Since Comrade Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party, put forward the slogan "Everyone in their position should engage in sports activities once a week" at the Second Gymnastics and Sports Conference in the summer of 1959, mass sports activities have rapidly developed further throughout the country. Offices, schools, and enterprises have added exercise breaks, many agricultural production cooperatives have set up football fields, and some residents in dispersed streets have also responded to the call by organizing themselves to exercise. The table tennis competition held in Berlin in early December 1959 was attended by more than 1,000 people and will not be completed until February 1960. Winter sports activities were particularly active in 1959.

Mass sports have already brought obvious benefits to people. In many factories, after the development of mass sports activities, people who used to suffer from minor illnesses have become healthier, and the attendance rate has greatly improved.

The Socialist Unity Party organizations at all levels attach great importance to mass sports activities. The government has allocated a large amount of funds to build sports facilities in order to develop mass sports activities. The Seven-Year Plan stipulates that more than 1,000 gymnasiums, more than a dozen large indoor swimming pools, and six artificial ice rinks will be built. People in various places have also invested in the construction of many sports fields and sports equipment.

Ewald, Chairman of the State Sports Committee of the German Democratic Republic, pointed out when talking about the Seven-Year Plan for sports that the task in the future is to mobilize the majority of people in factories, rural areas, and streets to regularly participate in sports activities, and strive to have one-third of the residents participate in regular physical exercise by 1965.

    “每人每周进行一次体育活动”的号召得到广泛响应
    德群众体育活动热火朝天
    据新华社讯　德意志民主共和国的群众性体育活动日益发展。目前，全国各地到处可以看到人们在作着适合自己体质的活动。
    自从统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希同志1959年夏季在第二届体操运动大会上提出“每人在自己的岗位上，每周进行一次体育活动”的口号以后，群众性的体育活动迅速在全国范围有了进一步的开展。机关、学校、企业里增添了工间操，许多农业生产合作社设置了足球场，有些居住分散的街道居民也响应这一号召组织起来进行锻炼。1959年12月初在柏林举行的乒乓球比赛，参加的有一千多人，比赛要到1960年2月才能结束。1959年的冬季体育活动特别活跃。
    群众性体育运动已经给人们带来了明显的好处。许多工厂里开展群众性体育活动后，常常患小病的人健壮了，出勤率大为提高。
    统一社会党各级组织对群众性体育活动非常重视。政府为了开展群众性体育活动拨出大量经费修造体育设备。在七年计划里就规定要修建一千多个体育馆，十多个大型室内游泳池、六个人造冰场。各地群众也出资修建了许多体育场和运动设备。
    德意志民主共和国国家体委主席埃瓦德在谈到体育的七年计划时曾指出，今后的任务是动员工厂、农村和街道的多数人都经常参加体育活动，争取在1965年有三分之一居民参加经常性的体育锻炼。
