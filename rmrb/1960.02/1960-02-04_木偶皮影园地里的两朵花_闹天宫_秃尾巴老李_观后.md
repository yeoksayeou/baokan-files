    Two Flowers in the World of Puppet and Shadow Play
    —After Watching "Havoc in Heaven" and "Bald Tail Old Li"

    Under the rain and sunshine of the Party, in recent years, puppet shows and shadow plays have been constantly growing and flourishing in the art garden of the motherland.

    This puppet show and shadow play performance is another large-scale gathering and grand review after the 1955 national performance. Judging from the programs performed in the first few days, today's puppet shows and shadow plays fully reflect the great achievements made by new and old artists in various places under the cultivation of the Party, in carrying forward traditions, delving into creation, and giving the audience new and amazing impressions.

    After watching "Havoc in Heaven" performed by the China Puppet Art Troupe, I feel that in addition to inheriting the tradition of puppet shows, they also absorbed the performance of operas, and humbly learned from fraternal troupes and foreign puppet art, creating their own novel style.

    The dialogue in the whole play is concise. Although Beijing opera gongs and drums are used, it does not fall into the rut of Beijing opera, but grasps the characteristics of puppet movements and fully pays attention to children's appreciation interests. For example, in the scene where Li Tianwang dispatches troops in the air, at a military order, the gods arrive in response, riding on clouds. Using small puppets to pull lines to fly back and forth in the sky, it shows the vastness and depth of the air, giving a sense of perspective. The scene of fighting with Erlang Shen suddenly transforms into a scene of birds flying and fish leaping on the sea, which are the most clever places for puppet shows that are difficult to perform on a real stage. Furthermore, the various laughable actions of the little monkeys somersaulting, standing on their heads, scratching, and playfully fighting, and the huge difference in size in besieging the giant spirit god, pulling and tugging in turns to hit Nezha, are all descriptions that best cater to children's psychology.

    In terms of modeling, this play brilliantly uses traditional facial makeup to highlight the character characteristics of various characters. For example, Sun Wukong's heroic spirit, the childishness and naughty image of the little monkeys, the hypocritical and false morality of Taibai and Lao Jun, and the foolishness of the barefoot immortal, although without the active production of opening eyes and mouth, the modeling contains certain thoughts and feelings, which is based on reality, with appropriate exaggeration. The stage design also achieves the artistic level of generalization and concentration. For example, one stove and one tent represent the Dou Shuai Palace, one tree and one stone represent the Peach Garden, that is, the cliffs and ridges of Huaguo Mountain, and only new lighting photography methods are used, and the furnishings are relatively simple and appropriate, showing a beautiful picture in simplicity.

    The method of combining staff, bag, string, and real people is also a new attempt. The only shortcoming is that the rhythm is slack and there is no climax. I think this play can be enriched very tensely, especially the final battle, which can be more exciting for the audience. For example, in Sun Wukong's final battle in the Heavenly Palace, the implicit expression method of sound effects, if coupled with more intense lighting changes, and the sound of thunder, to increase the atmosphere of battle, as a climax to deal with, will definitely grab the audience's emotions. In addition, some individual shapes are not uniform, the two fairies are not beautiful enough, and the image of the barefoot immortal can also be considered. In addition, it is hoped that the conspiracies and tricks of Taibai and Lao Jun, the accomplices, and their ugly behavior of wooing and buying off Sun Wukong will be exposed, which will be more meaningful.

    The shadow play "Bald Tail Old Li" is a folk tale that has been circulating in Heilongjiang for a long time. Its widespread circulation among the people is due to the people's love for Heilongjiang and their association with the origin of this term. This performance not only has a strong local flavor, but more importantly, it reflects the ideals of the local people's struggle. Using such a myth to illustrate the relationship between water conservancy and harvest is of great practical educational significance.

    The protagonist of the play, Black Dragon, is the incarnation of Old Li. He represents justice and does not hesitate to fight to safeguard the interests of the people, so the people love him very much. White Dragon is reactionary and destroys the interests of the people. However, due to the Black Dragon's justice and selflessness, coupled with the strength and support of the masses, the evil White Dragon was finally eliminated. The theme of this program is clear and the performance is very successful. What is particularly gratifying is that the operators of this performance are a group of lovely young people. Under the cultivation of the Party and the hard work of the veteran artists, in a short period of time, they have worked hard to learn traditions, master certain skills, and perform quite skillfully and vividly. The singing in this play is crisp and the melody is beautiful. What is particularly commendable is the brilliant and dazzling lighting design. For example, the cinematic subtitles are projected at the opening; the beautiful and realistic movement of clouds in the sky; the clear and vast flow of the river; the magical scene of the black dragon absorbing water and spraying rain; the tense scene of two dragons fighting fiercely on the turbulent sea. These novel lighting creations have enhanced the dramatic effect and mythological color of this program and are new achievements in shadow puppetry. (Attached picture)

    木偶皮影园地里的两朵花
    ——“闹天宫”“秃尾巴老李”观后
    虞哲光
    在党的雨露阳光下，近几年来木偶戏和皮影戏在祖国的艺术园地里，正不断地茁壮和繁茂起来。
    这次木偶戏皮影戏观摩演出是继1955年全国会演后，又一次大会师，大检阅。从开始几天演出的节目来看，今天的木偶戏和皮影戏充分反映了各地新老艺人在党的培育下，对发扬传统，钻研创造，都有了很大的成绩，给观众以新的惊奇的观感。
    看了中国木偶艺术剧团演出的“闹天宫”，我觉得他们除继承木偶戏的传统外，还吸收了戏曲的表演，并且虚心地向兄弟剧团学习，向外国木偶艺术学习，创造了自己新颖的风格。
    全剧对白简洁。虽然采用京剧的锣鼓，却不落京剧的窠臼，抓住木偶动作的特点，充分地注意到儿童的欣赏趣味。例如李天王在空中调兵遣将的场面，一声军令，众天神驾云应声而至。用小木偶拉线在天空来去飞驰，表现出空中辽阔深远，有透视的感觉。和二郎神斗法一场，倏然间变出海上鸟飞鱼跃的情景，这些都是真人舞台所难表演而木偶戏最讨巧的地方。再如众小猴翻斤斗，竖蜻蜓，抓痒，角逐嬉戏，大小悬殊地围攻着巨灵神，拉拉扯扯轮流去打哪叱，这种种可笑的动作，都是最迎合儿童心理的描写。
    在造型方面，这个戏出色地运用了传统的脸谱，突出了各种不同人物的性格特征。例如孙悟空的英武气概，众小猴的稚气和顽皮形象，太白和老君的虚伪假道学表情，赤脚大仙的愚蠢相，虽然不用目张口开的活动制作，而在造型上却包含着一定的思想感情，是在真实的基础上，加以适当的夸张。舞台装置也达到了概括集中的艺术水平。如一炉一帐表现兜率宫，一树一石表现蟠桃园，就是花果山的绝壁重岗，也只用新的灯光摄影方法，陈设得比较简练适当，在单纯中表现出优美的画面。
    动作采用杖头、布袋、拉线和真人四结合的方法，也是新的尝试。美中不足的是节奏显得松弛，没有高潮，我认为这个戏可以丰富得很紧张，特别是最后的战斗，能更激动观众。例如孙悟空最后在天宫战斗，用音响效果的含蓄表现方法，如果加上更强烈的灯光变幻，和雷霆万钧的音响配合，以增加战斗气氛，作为高潮来处理，一定会抓住观众的情绪。此外，有个别造型还不统一，二仙女也不够美丽，赤脚大仙的形象也可考虑。此外，还希望能把太白和老君两位帮凶的阴谋诡计、拉拢和收买孙悟空的丑恶行为暴露出来，将更有意义。
    皮影“秃尾巴老李”是黑龙江流传已久的民间故事。它在民间的广泛流传，是由于人们热爱黑龙江而联想到这个名词的由来。这个演出，不但有着浓厚的地方色彩，更重要的是反映了当地人民斗争的理想。用这样一个神话故事来说明水利和丰收的关系，是很有现实教育意义的。
    剧中主人翁黑龙，是老李的化身。他代表了正义，不惜为维护人民的利益而战，因此人民非常爱戴他。白龙是反动的，它摧残人民的利益。但由于黑龙的正义，舍己为人，加上人民群众的力量和支持，终于把万恶的白龙消灭了。这个节目的主题思想明确，演出也非常成功。特别可喜的是这次演出的操作者是一群可爱的青年，他们在党的培养和老艺人的辛勤教育下，在短短的时间内，努力学习传统，能够掌握一定的技巧，演得相当熟练生动。这个戏的唱腔清脆，曲调优美。尤其值得赞赏的是精彩夺目的灯光设计。如开幕时映出电影化的字幕；天空云彩移动的美丽逼真；江水流动的清澈浩瀚；黑龙吸水喷雨的奇妙情景，波涛汹涌的海洋上，二龙激战的紧张场面。这些新颖的灯光创造，都增强了这个节目的戏剧效果和神话色彩，是皮影艺术新的成就。（附图片）
