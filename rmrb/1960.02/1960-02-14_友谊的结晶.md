    The Crystallization of Friendship
    Li Shouqi, Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Beijing Thermal Power Plant Committee

    Whenever I talk about Sino-Soviet friendship, I am deeply moved. This is because our plant was built with the help of Soviet experts. From design to construction to production, which link didn't involve the hard work of Soviet experts! The newest and best machinery and equipment in the plant were all shipped from the Soviet Union. I remember when the Minister of the Soviet Power Station Department came to China the year before last, he visited our plant. We expressed our gratitude to him, and he said warmly and heartily, "No need to thank us, no need to thank us, for the sake of friendship, we can give our hearts." These words made my heart tremble. Immersed in the emotion of friendship, I held his hand and couldn't say a word for a long time.

    The work enthusiasm of the Soviet experts, in particular, moved us and is a model for us to learn from. They shared weal and woe with the workers of the whole plant, often forgetting to eat and sleep, and working through the night. When our plant was presenting a gift to the National Day, the expert Nekrasov, who was nearly sixty years old, stayed at the site all the time, even forgetting to eat. The Soviet experts also passed on their superb technology to Chinese workers and technicians, enabling everyone to learn a set of skills. The Soviet experts also put forward a large number of suggestions based on the specific conditions of our plant to speed up the construction of our plant and ensure the quality of our project. In the second phase of construction alone, the experts put forward 1,579 valuable suggestions. The Soviet experts also tried their best to save materials and reduce project costs. Expert Makarov often said, "China is under construction and needs everything, so we should save as much as possible."

    In the past two years, we have not only learned a lot of technical knowledge from Soviet experts, but also learned their excellent qualities. We all regard the experts as our good teachers and helpful friends. We feel the deep friendship of the Soviet people towards us all the time.

    It can be said that our plant was built jointly by the people of China and the Soviet Union and is the crystallization of Sino-Soviet friendship. When we greet the tenth anniversary of the signing of the great Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance with incomparable excitement, all the staff of our plant cannot suppress the excitement in our hearts and want to express our heartfelt thanks to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, the Soviet people, and the Soviet expert comrades.

    The entire staff of our plant is drinking the nectar of friendship, taking more firm steps, and leaping forward at a rapid pace towards greater victory goals.

    友谊的结晶
    中共北京热电厂委员会书记　李寿祺
    一谈到中苏友谊，我最感动。因为，我们厂就是在苏联专家的帮助下建立起来的。从设计到施工到生产，哪一个环节不经过苏联专家的辛勤劳动！厂里的最新最好的机器设备，都是从苏联运来的。记得苏联电站部部长前年来中国的时候，曾经到我厂参观。我们向他表示感谢，他热情爽朗地说：“不要谢不要谢，为了友谊，我们可以把心都交出来。”这话听得我心里一阵颤动。沉浸在友谊的感动里，我握着他的手，半响说不出一句话来。
    苏联专家们的劳动热情，尤其使我们感动，是我们学习的榜样。他们和全厂工人同甘共苦，常常废寝忘食，通宵达旦地工作。在我厂向国庆献礼的时候，年近花甲的聂克拉索夫专家时刻不离现场，连饭都忘记了吃。苏联专家们还把自己精湛的技术传授给中国工人和技术人员，使他们人人学到了一套本领。苏联专家们也根据我厂的具体情况，提出了大量的建议，来加快我厂的建设速度，保证我厂的工程质量。仅仅在二期施工中，专家们就提出了一千五百七十九项宝贵建议。苏联专家们还千方百计地节约材料，降低工程造价。马卡洛夫专家经常说：“中国正在建设，什么都需要，所以我们应尽量节约。”
    两年来，我们不仅从苏联专家那里学到很多技术知识，而且也学习了他们的优秀品质。我们都把专家当作自己的良师益友。我们时时刻刻都感受到苏联人民对我们的深厚友谊。
    可以说，我们厂是中苏两国人民共同建设起来的，是中苏友谊的结晶。当我们以无比兴奋的心情来迎接伟大的中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订十周年的时候，我们全厂职工抑止不住心头的激动，要向苏联共产党、苏联政府、苏联人民和苏联专家同志们表示衷心的感谢。
    我们厂全体职工畅饮着友谊的甘露，跨着更加坚强的步伐，飞速向更大的胜利目标跃进。
