Xinhua News Agency, 6th Dispatch: China's basic construction has achieved great success in high-speed development in 1959 by implementing the policy of simultaneously developing large, medium and small enterprises. In this year, there were 1,341 above-quota construction projects under construction nationwide, of which 671 were fully or partially completed and put into production; of the 75,000 below-quota construction projects undertaken at the county level and above, 54,000 have been completed. The total investment in basic construction within the state budget for the whole year was 26.7 billion yuan, an increase of 24.5% over 1958.

Under the guidance of the policy of simultaneously developing large, medium and small enterprises, in 1959 the country concentrated its efforts on continuing to build a number of large-scale modern factories and mines as the backbone of the national economy. In this year, the state's investment in the construction of above-quota factories and mines accounted for about 63% of the total industrial investment; the above-quota factories and mines completed and partially completed and put into production throughout the year included large blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces in the two new steel bases of Wuhan Iron and Steel and Baotou Steel, the modern Luoyang Tractor Factory and Lanzhou Refinery, the large-scale Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station in Zhejiang and Gutian Hydropower Station in Fujian, thermal power plants in Beijing, Liaoning, Jilin, Fuxin and other places, as well as the Pingdingshan No. 1 Mine large vertical shaft with an annual output of 1.5 million tons of raw coal, the Sichuan Jiangyou Cement Plant with an annual output of 700,000 tons of cement, the Wuhu Paperboard Factory with an annual output of 50,000 tons, the Guangdong Sugar Cane Chemical Plant with a daily crushing capacity of 3,000 tons of sugar cane, and the Shaanxi No. 7 Cotton Textile Factory with 60,000 spindles, and so on. While building large-scale factories and mines, more than 200 large and medium-sized reservoirs were built across the country last year. The Sanmenxia in Henan, Danjiangkou in Hubei, Weishan in Shandong, and Miyun in Beijing completed the cut-off project last year. Some of the dams have been built to flood control height, initially playing a flood control role. Modern transportation construction has also made great progress. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang and Lanzhou-Qinghai railways have been opened to traffic to Hami in Xinjiang and Xining in Qinghai respectively; a large part of the double-tracking projects of major trunk lines such as Beijing-Guangzhou, Tianjin-Pukou, and Longhai have also been completed and opened to traffic.

Small and medium-sized enterprises have developed even faster. In 1959, all localities further emphasized the construction of such enterprises. In this year, the state's investment in the construction of small and medium-sized enterprises accounted for about 37% of the total industrial construction investment; all regions also raised a large amount of funds outside the state budget for the construction of such enterprises. The small and medium-sized enterprises below quota that were completed and partially completed last year are distributed in all regions and industries across the country. For example, in the iron and steel industry, more than 1,000 small and medium-sized iron and steel enterprises have been built in various places on the basis of the large-scale steelmaking movement in 1958. In order to cooperate with the development of small and medium-sized iron and steel industries, a large number of simple coal washing plants and simple coke ovens were also built in 1959. As a result of focusing on iron and steel and machinery to run small and medium-sized factories on a large scale, almost all provinces and regions in the country now have small and medium-sized iron and steel bases and machinery factories. Before 1958, only Shanghai and Harbin in the country could manufacture complete sets of power generation equipment; now most parts of the country can manufacture small and medium-sized power generation equipment. Before 1958, only a few large enterprises in the country produced petroleum; after more than a year of construction, small and medium-sized man-made petroleum plants have been built in all parts of the country except for individual regions. The crude oil production capacity of these new plants has reached about 400,000 tons. Other small and medium-sized mines, small and medium-sized power stations, small and medium-sized chemical plants, and various small and medium-sized daily-use light industrial factories have also sprung up all over the country. All localities also used their own produced steel to build small railways with self-made locomotives. Last year, a total of more than 2,000 kilometers of local railways and small foreign railways were built and opened to traffic nationwide.

The great achievements of basic construction in 1959 show that the implementation of the policy of simultaneously developing large, medium and small enterprises can not only promote the high-speed development of the national economy, but also rapidly improve the technological level of China's industry. Large-scale modern factories and mines are the backbone force for rapidly building China into a modern industrial power. Developing large-scale modern enterprises can not only provide indispensable high, large, sophisticated and cutting-edge products for the technological transformation of the national economy and the climbing of technological peaks, but also provide equipment for the large-scale development of small and medium-sized enterprises. The large-scale projects built in China in 1959 showed great superiority in this regard as in the past. For example, the 500-ton large open-hearth furnace put into production by Wuhan Iron and Steel Company last year can produce molten steel that can be cast into large steel ingots required for heavy and large forgings that are difficult to cast in small open-hearth furnaces. The large transformer workshop of Shenyang Transformer Factory, which was completed last year, will produce large transformers that can transmit the power generated by large power stations to areas nearly 1,000 kilometers away. A petroleum drilling rig recently manufactured by Lanzhou Petroleum Chemical Machinery Factory can drill to a depth of 3,200 meters. It can drill out the oil buried at a depth of two to three thousand meters. Several 2,500-ton hydraulic presses were installed across the country last year. With this equipment, large forgings required for 10,000-ton ocean-going ships, 800mm rolling mills and 50,000-kilowatt steam turbines can be manufactured faster. Large enterprises can better support the construction of small and medium-sized enterprises in terms of technology and equipment. Last year, all localities obtained more than 230 sets of simple coal washing equipment and 4,300 sets of simple coking equipment from the machinery industry sector in a very short period of time, and built a large number of simple coal washing plants and simple coke ovens. The national machinery industry sector also produced a large number of metallurgical, chemical and other equipment last year to support the development of small and medium-sized enterprises in various places.

Small and medium-sized enterprises have short construction periods, low investment, quick results, and relatively easy technology to master. Actively developing such enterprises can provide new production capacity for various industrial sectors that is difficult to achieve quickly by relying solely on the construction of large enterprises. According to calculations, of the iron smelting, power generation, coal mining, coal washing, coking, cement and other production capacities increased through basic construction in the country in 1959, about half or more were provided by newly built small and medium-sized enterprises. Building more small and medium-sized enterprises can also fully mobilize the enthusiasm of localities to run industries and the enthusiasm of the masses to run industries. This is of great importance for changing the original unreasonable industrial layout and better integrating industry and agriculture.

    贯彻大中小企业同时并举方针
    全国基本建设日新月异
    六百多限额以上建设项目相继投入生产七万五千个中小企业有五万四千个先后完工
    新华社6日讯　我国基本建设贯彻执行大中小企业同时并举的方针，1959年取得了高速度发展的伟大成就。这一年全国施工的限额以上的建设项目有一千三百四十一个，全部建成和部分建成投入生产的有六百七十一个；县级以上兴办的限额以下的七万五千个建设项目，有五万四千个已经完工。全年完成的国家预算内基本建设投资总额为二百六十七亿元，比1958年增长24．5％。
    在大中小型企业同时并举方针的指导下，1959年全国集中力量继续建设了一批作为国民经济骨干力量的大型现代化厂矿企业。这一年，国家用来建设限额以上厂矿企业的投资，约占全部工业投资的63％；全年建成和部分建成投入生产的限额以上的厂矿企业有武钢、包钢两个新建钢铁基地的大型高炉和平炉，现代化洛阳拖拉机制造厂和兰州炼油厂，规模巨大的浙江新安江和福建古田水电站，北京、辽宁、吉林、阜新等地的火电厂，还有年产原煤一百五十万吨的平顶山一矿大型竖井，年产水泥七十万吨的四川江油水泥厂，年产五万吨的芜湖板纸厂，日榨甘蔗三千吨的广东甘蔗化工厂，拥有六万纺锭的陕西第七棉纺织厂，等等。在建设大型厂矿企业的同时，去年全国建设了二百多座大中型水库，河南的三门峡、湖北的丹江口、山东的位山、北京的密云等水库，有的在去年完成了截流工程，有的大坝已修到了拦洪高度，初步起到了拦洪作用。现代化的交通运输建设事业也有了很大发展。兰新、兰青铁路已经先后分别通车到新疆的哈密和青海的西宁；京广、津浦、陇海等主要干线的复线工程，也有很大一部分建成通车。
    中小型企业发展速度更快，1959年各地都进一步重视了这类企业的建设。这一年，国家用来建设中小型企业的投资，约占全部工业建设投资37％；各地区还在国家预算之外，为建设这类企业自筹了一大批资金。各地去年建成和部分建成的限额以下的中小型企业，分布在全国各地区各行业。例如在钢铁工业方面，各地在1958年大炼钢铁运动的基础上，已经建设起了一千多个中小型钢铁企业。为了配合中小型钢铁工业的发展，1959年还建设了大批简易洗煤厂和简易焦炉。以钢铁和机械为中心大办中小型工厂的结果，现在几乎是全国各省区都有中小型钢铁基地和机械工厂。1958年以前，全国能够成套制造发电设备的只有上海和哈尔滨；而现在全国大部分地区都能制造中小型发电设备。1958年以前，全国生产石油的只有少数几个大企业；经过一年多的建设，现在全国除个别地区以外，都已建起了中小型人造石油厂，这些新厂的原油生产能力已经达到四十万吨左右。其他如中小型矿井、中小型电站、中小型化工厂和各种中小型日用轻工业工厂等，也在全国遍地开花。各地还用自己生产的钢铁自制机车自建小型铁路，去年全国建成通车的土铁路和小洋铁路共达两千多公里。
    1959年基本建设的伟大成就说明，贯彻大中小型企业同时并举的方针，既可促使国民经济高速度发展，又可迅速提高我国工业的技术水平。大型现代化厂矿是把我国迅速建成现代化工业强国的骨干力量，发展大型现代化企业，不但能为国民经济进行技术改造和攀登技术高峰提供不可缺少的高大精尖的产品，同时也可以为中小型企业的大量发展提供装备。1959年我国建成的大型工程，在这方面同过去一样显出了巨大的优越性。例如去年武汉钢铁公司投入生产的五百吨大型平炉，出的钢水可以铸成小型平炉难以铸成的重型大型锻件所需的大钢锭。去年建成的沈阳变压器厂大型变压器车间，将要生产的大型变压器能把大型电站发出的电力输送到近千公里的地区。兰州石油化工机械厂最近制成的一台石油钻机，能够钻进三千二百米。它可以把埋藏在深达二、三千米的石油钻探出来。去年全国安装了好几台二千五百吨水压机，有了这种设备就能更快地制造出万吨远洋轮船、八百毫米轧钢机和五万瓩汽轮机所需的大型锻件等。大型企业可以更好地在技术上设备上支援中小型企业的建设。去年各地在很短的时间内就从机械工业部门获得了二百三十多套简易洗煤设备和四千三百组简易炼焦设备，建设起大批简易洗煤厂和简易焦炉。全国机械工业部门去年还生产了大量的冶金、化工等设备，支援了各地发展中小型企业。
    中小型企业工期短、投资少、收效快、技术也比较容易掌握，积极发展这类企业，能为工业各部门提供单靠建设大型企业难以迅速达到的新的生产能力。据计算，1959年全国通过基本建设增加的炼铁、发电、采煤、洗煤、炼焦、水泥等生产能力中，约有一半以上是由新建中小型企业提供的。多多建设中小型企业还可以充分地发挥地方办工业的积极性和群众办工业的积极性。这对改变原来工业布局不合理的状况、更好地使工业和农业结合起来，有着十分重要的作用。
