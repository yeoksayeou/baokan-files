    Tianjin, February 15th (Reported by our correspondent Shi Bo): The internal transportation of factories and enterprises in Tianjin is rapidly moving towards mechanization. In just over a month, the level of mechanization in the city's factory transportation has generally increased from 1% to 10% to 80% to 100%, ensuring continuous leaps forward in production.

    The internal transportation, handling, and loading/unloading links of factories and enterprises in Tianjin were originally in a backward stage of manual operation. According to surveys of several key factories and enterprises, handling workers accounted for about 60% of production workers. Handling and loading/unloading time accounted for 40% to 50% of the entire transportation process. This situation became a weak link in production.

    The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China analyzed this situation and, in accordance with the spirit of "production is the center, transportation is the key; increasing production without increasing manpower, high transportation ensures high production," vigorously grasped factory transportation and launched a publicity and education campaign on "improving transportation to promote production," establishing an overall concept of grasping both production and transportation among leaders at all levels and the vast number of employees. From the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, various industrial bureaus to various factories and enterprises, comprehensive plans were made, and Party committees at all levels established factory-run transportation technology innovation and technology revolution offices, organizing dedicated personnel to carry out campaigns. Up to now, four campaigns have been fought. By mid-February, citywide employees had submitted more than 200,000 innovation proposals, implemented more than 100,000, and manufactured more than 10,000 handling and loading/unloading machines. More than 180 units in the city with large transportation volumes have basically achieved the "one network and four modernizations" of factory transportation: mechanized handling and loading/unloading, rail and cableway transportation, and smooth roads. The freight volume of these units accounts for 80% of the city's total freight volume, saving 30% to 50% of handling and loading/unloading workers, and increasing the efficiency of factory transportation, handling, and loading/unloading by three to dozens of times, greatly promoting the development of production. For example, the Tianjin No. 1 Flour Factory achieved the "one network and four modernizations" of factory transportation in ten days, and the daily production of flour increased sharply from 17,000 bags to 24,000 bags.

    The Tianjin factory-run transportation movement has gained momentum, speed, and good results, mainly because it adopts a method of planned, led, focused breakthroughs, and overall flowering. In the movement, the Party secretaries of various district committees and enterprise Party committees personally took charge, adopting a method of going directly to the grassroots level, formulating plans and phased implementation steps according to industries such as metallurgy, machinery, chemical industry, grain processing, and light industry, so that the masses have clear goals to strive for. Then, they let go and mobilize the masses, organize assault weeks and assault ten-day periods, concentrate forces, and make key breakthroughs. In this way, breaking through one place, then another, eliminating one batch, then another, ensures that the mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading movement is higher than the previous one, the scale is larger than the previous one, and more and more units are armed. This enables complete and continuous innovation projects to blossom in one place and bear fruit throughout the city. The metallurgy and machinery industries have large transportation volumes and more heavy transportation, so they focused on exchanging the experience of Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant in crane-based loading and unloading and rail-based locomotive transportation within the factory. The light industry, textile, and rubber industries have small transportation volumes, but the handling work between workshops and between processes in the production process is frequent and complex, so they focused on promoting the continuous conveyor belt experience of Tianjin Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory and Aluminum Products Factory. According to the large number of processes and the scattered courtyards, the Aluminum Products Factory initially used conveyor belts to organically connect the seven workshops distributed in the three courtyards, so that production and transportation were continuous operations. The grain processing industry mainly promoted the experience of Tianjin No. 1 Flour Factory in high-altitude chutes and in-warehouse space transportation. The Tianjin No. 1 Flour Factory manufactured three conveyors, two high-altitude chutes, and one in-warehouse space transportation line in ten days, so that the raw materials entering the machine, the finished products entering the warehouse, and the delivery from the factory are all continuous, forming a complete continuous automatic transportation system within the factory, forming a land, water, and high-altitude transportation network with lines connected to each other and links connected to each other.

    Tianjin also, in view of the characteristics that the freight yards and wharves have relatively weak technical forces and involve a wide range of businesses, organized professional transportation departments and factory enterprises and other units under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels, and launched a "dragon" large-scale collaboration of technological revolution, so that the upper and lower levels, internal and external, and various departments and blocks are closely combined, and implemented "five unifications" (materials, funds, manpower, manufacturing, use, etc.), which played an important role in achieving mechanization and semi-mechanization at high speed. In addition, the rational division of labor and close cooperation between factory transportation and professional transportation formed an integral whole of production and transportation, and transportation efficiency was greatly improved. According to statistics from units that have implemented production and transportation collaboration, vehicle turnover rate has increased by about 20%, transportation efficiency has increased by several times, and the idleness of labor and machinery, which wastes labor, has been completely eliminated.

    In order to adapt to the new situation after technological innovation, various industries have rapidly changed labor organization and adjusted labor force according to the size of the enterprise, the amount of transportation, and the amount of transportation capacity. With the realization of innovative equipment “one network and four modernizations”, various enterprises first established specialized transportation institutions, fixed specialized personnel; transferred a large number of laborers who were previously occupied by manual operations to new production positions, and adapted to modern production and transportation management. For example, after the Junliangcheng Rice Processing Factory realized the "one network and four modernizations" of factory transportation, the more than 200 strong laborers saved were transferred to newly built workshops such as Baijiu, activated carbon, and charcoal powder to meet the needs of production. The improvement of transportation efficiency has also promoted the reform of production equipment. For example, after Tianjin No. 1 Flour Factory realized the "one network and four modernizations," the transportation capacity was one and a half times higher than the production capacity, which forced the reform of wheat peeling, one-machine grinding and other equipment, so that the production level was increased by more than one time. With the replacement of manual labor by machinery, and the change of handling and loading/unloading workers from manual operation to operating machinery, various districts and bureaus have correspondingly established professional training classes for the use of machinery, technical maintenance, etc., to improve their technical level of use. With the change of labor organization and operation nature, various factories and enterprises have timely changed the reward system and formulated new operating procedures.

    天津厂内运输改革迅速
    全面规划　通力协作　分批突击　一个多月大部机械化
    本报天津15日电　记者史博报道：天津市工厂企业内部运输高速度奔向机械化。仅一个多月的时间，全市厂内运输机械化程度一般由1％到10％，提高到80％到100％，保证了生产不断跃进。
    天津市各工厂企业的内部运输、搬运装卸环节，原来停留在落后的手工操作阶段。根据几个重点工厂企业的调查，搬运工人占生产工人的60％左右。搬运装卸的时间在全部运输过程中占40％到50％。这种情况成为生产中薄弱的一环。
    中共天津市委分析了这种情况，根据“生产是中心，运输是关键；增产不增人，高运保高产”的精神，狠抓厂内运输，开展“办好运输，促进生产”的宣传教育运动，在各级领导干部和广大职工中，树立既抓生产又抓运输的整体观念。从中共天津市委、各工业局到各个工厂企业都作了全面规划，各级党委成立了厂办运输技术革新和技术革命办公室，组织专人，开展战役，到目前已打了四次战役。到2月中旬，全市职工已提革新建议二十多万件，实现了十余万件，制造搬运装卸机具一万多件。全市已有一百八十多个运输量较大的单位，基本实现了搬运装卸机械化、运输轨道化索道化、道路畅通化的厂内运输“一网四化”。这些单位的货运量占全市货运总量的80％，共节约搬运装卸工人30％到50％，提高厂内运输搬运、装卸效率三倍到几十倍，大大促进了生产的发展。如天津市第一面粉厂在十天内就实现了厂内运输“一网四化”，日产面粉由一万七千袋猛增到两万四千袋。
    天津市厂办运输运动来势猛、速度快、效果好，主要是因为采用有计划、有领导、重点突破、全面开花的办法。运动中，各区委、企业党委书记亲自挂帅，采取一竿子插到底的办法，按冶金、机械、化工、粮食加工、轻工等行业，分别制定规划和分批分期实现的步骤，使群众的奋斗目标明确。然后放手发动群众，组织突击周、突击旬，集中力量，重点突破。这样，突破一处，再突破一处，干掉一批，再干一批，就保证了装卸机械化、半机械化运动一浪比一浪高，规模一次比一次大，武装起来的单位一次比一次多。使成套化、连续化的革新项目，一处开花全市结果。冶金、机械行业运量大，笨重运输较多，就着重交流了天津第一钢厂在装卸吊车化、厂内运输轨道机车化的经验。轻工、纺织、橡胶行业运量小，但生产过程中车间之间、工序之间的搬运工作频繁复杂，就着重推广了天津大中华橡胶厂和铝品厂输送机连续化的经验。铝品厂根据工序多、院落分散的情况，开始就以输送带把分布在三个院落的七个车间有机的连接起来，使生产、运输连续作业。粮食加工行业主要推广了天津第一面粉厂高空溜槽、库内空间运输的经验。天津第一面粉厂在十天内制造了三条输送机、两道高空溜槽、一条库内空间运输线，使原料入机器、成品入库、出厂全部实现连续化，构成厂内完整的连续自动化的运输体系，形成线线相连，环环相接的陆地、水运、高空运输网。
    天津还针对货场、码头技术力量比较薄弱，业务牵扯的面较广的特点，组织专业运输部门和工厂企业等单位在各级党委的统一领导下，展开了技术革命“一条龙”大协作，使上下内外、条条块块紧密结合起来，实行“五统一”（材料、资金、人力、制造、使用等统一），对高速度实现机械化、半机械化起了重要作用。加以厂内运输和专业运输合理分工，密切配合，形成生产、运输的整体，运输效率大大提高。据已实行产、运协作一条龙的单位统计，车辆周转率提高20％左右，运输效率提高几倍，浪费劳力机具的窝工现象彻底根除。
    为了适应技术革新后的新形势，各行业根据企业大小、运量大小，运力大小迅速地改变了劳动组织，调整了劳动力。随着革新机具
  “一网四化”的实现，各企业首先成立了专管运输机构，固定了专管人员；把过去手工操作占用的大批劳动力调到新的生产岗位上去，和现代化生产、运输管理相适应。如军粮城机米加工厂实现厂内运输
  “一网四化”后，节约的二百多名壮劳动力调到白酒、活性炭、炭粉等新建车间，满足生产的需要。运输效率的提高，也促使生产设备的改革，如天津第一面粉厂实现“一网四化”后，运输能力高于生产能力一倍半，就迫使改革小麦剥皮、一机磨研等设备，使生产水平再提高一倍多。随着机械代替手工，搬运装卸工人由手工操作改为操纵机械，各区、各局都相应的成立了机具使用、技术保修等专业训练班，提高他们的使用技术水平。随着劳动组织和作业性质的改变，各工厂企业及时改变了奖励制度，制订了新的操作规程。
