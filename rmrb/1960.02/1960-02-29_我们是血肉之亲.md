Accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture is a glorious task assigned to us, the working class, by the Party. To accomplish this task, all the staff and workers of our factory are taking every measure to rush-produce mechanized and semi-mechanized tools for cultivation, animal husbandry, cooking, and other aspects, day and night. From the fourth quarter of last year to now, we have created and improved 51 types of mechanized and semi-mechanized tools, totaling more than 15,000 pieces (sets); produced more than 53,600 machine parts for tractors, locomotive boilers, diesel engines, and other machines; and repaired and fitted 31,200 pieces of farm tools for production teams. This is our gift to agricultural technical transformation over the past four months.

Our achievements are inseparable from the leadership of the Party committee and the support of our peasant brothers. Our factory was established just over a year ago, with relatively simple equipment and weak technical strength. Initially, we could only repair and fit some small farm tools. To enable us to vigorously support agriculture, the responsible comrades of the commune Party committee frequently came to our factory to give instructions and make demands, sometimes even personally helping us to study and manufacture new farm tools suitable for local farming conditions. The production teams were even more enthusiastic in giving us strong support in terms of manpower and raw materials. More than 90% of the workers in our factory are peasants from various production teams, some of whom are experienced production team leaders, some are locomotive boiler operators, and some are skilled craftsmen from the countryside. To support industry, as long as the factory needed them, the production teams proactively transferred these talents to the factory. The material support provided to us by the peasants was even greater. When the factory needed raw materials, the production teams collected scrap copper and iron day and night, and transported it to the factory in large and small carts. The earthenware pipes, stone rollers, and wood for making farm tools in the factory were all supplied by the peasants. The workers often said, "The countryside is our logistics department. Whatever we lack, they support us with. Whenever we need it, they deliver it." These aids not only greatly encouraged us but also solved many production difficulties for us. The peasants regarded the factory as their own. Last year, during the dog days of summer, on a rainy night, the peasants of the Guangming Street Production Team heard that the factory wall had collapsed and rushed to the factory in the rain. As soon as they entered, they asked, "Is the machinery damaged?" They repeatedly told us to protect the machinery well. We were truly moved at the time. The next day, as soon as it was light, the production team sent seven more commune members, pulling a large cart of wheat straw, and started to repair the house for us. Without allowing us to say anything, some carried soil, some mixed mud, and they worked all day, plastering eight rooms for us. Such things are countless and endless.

The peasants' technical assistance to us is also great. The old farmers often proactively come to the factory to propose topics for trial production of new farm tools and methods for improving tools. When we were manufacturing combined machines for rolling, harrowing, leveling, plowing, and ridge-building, universal seeders, potato diggers, feed crushers, vegetable cutters, and other new agricultural implements, dozens of old farmers helped to give ideas and suggestions for improvement. It can be said that the successful trial production of many new farm tools was a joint creation with the peasants. We support agricultural technical transformation, and agriculture has also supported our production development and the improvement of our technical level. The relationship between workers and peasants has become closer and more consolidated in the course of agricultural technical transformation. The phrase "workers and peasants are flesh and blood" has also given us a deeper understanding.

We will never be satisfied with the achievements we have made. We must continue to liberate our minds, deeply study the experience of peasant tool reform, and produce more and better new agricultural tools suitable for our country's farming conditions, to promote the faster realization of modernized agricultural production, and to achieve the common leap forward of industry and agriculture, flying side by side.

Our production team has undergone great changes: we have tractors for plowing, locomotive boilers for irrigation, seeders for sowing, cultivators for weeding, and rubber-tired carts for farm transportation. This is a great revolution in agricultural production. The children's rhymes of "No need for cattle to plow, water flows by itself for irrigation" have now become reality. Thinking about these changes, we can only say: thank the leadership of the Party, thank the assistance of our worker elder brothers.

To produce more grain, it is impossible without the support of industry. A comparison makes it clear. In the past, when irrigating, we used old waterwheels that had to be pushed and pulled, and six or seven people could only irrigate two or three mu a day. In dry years, we were really anxious all day long around the well platform. And for plowing, one donkey and one plow could only plow about two mu of land a day, and we were so tired that our backs ached and our legs hurt. There was no way to increase production. After working hard for a year, one mu of wheat would only yield a hundred or so jin. It was not until our worker elder brothers manufactured some new farm tools such as seven-inch plows, double-wheel double-share plows, and horse-drawn weeding hoes that production increased year after year. After the establishment of the People's Commune, things got even better. The worker elder brothers sent us tractors, harvesters, threshers, locomotive boilers, electric motors, and all kinds of new farm tools, both large and small. Plowing, irrigating, leveling, weeding, and other tasks were all mechanized and semi-mechanized. It was really easy and labor-saving, and we felt happy from the bottom of our hearts when we worked. In terms of output, the average yield of wheat per mu last year increased to 385 jin, and sweet potatoes reached an average yield of more than 5,000 jin per mu. We had been farming for decades, but this was the first time we had seen so much grain produced on our alkaline and sandy land.

Our production has developed so fast, and our farm tools have changed so much. Tracing the root and asking the bottom, we cannot help but thank our worker elder brothers from the bottom of our hearts. From simple farm tools, they have step by step provided us with semi-mechanized and mechanized farm tools. After the Party Central Committee issued the call to accelerate agricultural technical transformation, the industry's enthusiasm for arming us has become even greater. They give us whatever we need, and replenish whatever we lack. Everyone says: this is giving us wings, allowing us to fly faster, and to leap forward together with industry hand in hand. Speaking of the workers' help to us, we could talk about it for days. They think of us everywhere, even more thoughtfully than we do ourselves. Let me give a few examples. In 1957, when the wheat was harvested and brought to the threshing floor, we encountered continuous rainy days. It rained for more than twenty days in a row, and we were anxious and didn't know what to do. At this time, the workers drove tractors and rushed to harvest all 400 mu of wheat in one day and one night. If it were not for the timely assistance of the worker elder brothers, the commune members would have worked hard for nothing for a year. To take a recent example, when watering wheat last year, whenever a machine broke down, whether it was windy, rainy, or in the middle of the night, the workers of the commune's farm tool manufacturing and repair factory would come immediately after receiving a phone call. Sometimes, to repair a water pump, the workers would roll up their trousers and go into the water in the cold weather. There is nothing else to say, the commune members can only take them as an example and study hard. The factory repairs machines, farm tools, and transportation vehicles, and takes responsibility from beginning to end. Not only that, but the worker elder brothers also frequently understand our needs, solicit opinions on new farm tools, impart technology, and send new farm tools to our doorsteps for our appraisal. Today, we have machines and a large number of new mechanized and semi-mechanized farm tools. We cannot help but think of the hard work of our worker elder brothers, and we cannot help but attribute it to the comprehensive and selfless assistance of industry to agricultural technical transformation.

In the process of accelerating the realization of agricultural technical transformation, we must take our worker elder brothers as an example and strive to produce more grain to support industry.

    我们是血肉之亲
    加速农业技术改造，是党交给我们工人阶级的一项光荣任务。为了实现这一任务，我们工厂的全体职工采取一切措施，日夜为农业赶制耕作、饲养、炊事等方面的机械化、半机械化机具。从去年第四季度到现在，已经创造和改良了五十一种、一万五千多件（台）机械化、半机械化机具，生产了拖拉机、锅驼机、柴油机等机器部件五万三千六百多件，还为生产队修配了三万一千二百件农具。这是四个多月以来，我们对农业技术改造的一份献礼。
    我们取得的这些成绩，是和党委的领导以及农民兄弟的支持分不开的。我们厂建立刚刚一年多，设备比较简陋，技术力量也很薄弱，最初只能修配一些小型的农具。为了让我们能大力支援农业，公社党委的负责同志经常到我厂给予指示、提出要求，有时还亲自帮助我们研究制造适合当地耕作条件的新式农具。各生产队更是热情地从人力、原料等方面给我们大力支持。我们工厂的工人90％以上是来自各个生产队的农民，有的是有农业生产经验的生产小队长，有的是锅驼机手，有的是农村中的能工巧匠。为了支援工业，只要工厂需要，各生产队都是主动地把这批人才输送给工厂。农民对我们进行的物资上的支援就更多了。工厂需要原料，各生产队就日夜到处收集废铜废铁，大车小车的送到工厂。工厂里的缸瓦管、石碾以及制造农具的木料，全是农民们供给我们的。工人们常说：“农村就是我们的后勤部，缺什么就支援什么，什么时候用，就什么时候送到。”这些援助不仅给了我们很大的鼓舞，还给我们解决了很多生产上的困难。农民把工厂看成是自己的工厂。去年伏天，在一个下大雨的夜里，光明街生产队的农民听说工厂的墙塌了，就冒着大雨赶到工厂，一进门就问：“机器损坏了没有？”千嘱咐万嘱咐，让我们好好保护住机器。当时真使我们感动极了。第二天天刚放亮，生产队又派来了七名社员拉着一大车麦秸，动手给我们修理房子，根本不容我们说什么，立刻拉土的拉土，和泥的和泥，忙了一整天，给我们抹了八间房顶。像这样的事，简直是数不清，说不完。
    农民在技术上对我们的帮助也是很大的，老农常常主动地到工厂给我们提出试制新农具的课题和改良工具的办法。我们在制造轧、耙、平、整、筑畦联合器，万能点播机，刨薯器，饲料粉碎机，切菜机等新式农业机具时，就有几十个老农帮助出主意和提出改进意见。可以说，许多新农具的试制成功都是和农民共同创造的。我们支援农业技术改造，农业也支援了我们生产的发展和技术水平的提高。工人和农民的关系，在农业技术改造当中，更加密切、巩固了。工农是血肉的关系这句话，也使我们体会得更深刻了。
    我们绝不满足已取得的成绩，要继续解放思想，深入研究农民工具改革的经验，生产出更多更好的适合我们国家耕作条件的新式农具，促使农业更快地实现现代化生产，做到工业、农业比翼双飞，共同跃进。
    祁州人民公社农具制造修配厂工人　李光启
    我们生产队现在可大变样了：耕地有拖拉机，浇地使锅驼机，耩地用播种器，锄地用中耕器，农田运输实现胶轮车子化。这可是个农业生产上的大革命。“耕地不用牛，浇地自来流”的童谣，现在都成了真事。想想这些变化，我们只能说：感谢党的领导，感谢工人老大哥的援助。
    要想多打粮食，没有工业的支援是办不到的。一对比就看得清清楚楚了。过去浇地，推来拉去的旧水车，六、七个人一天也不过浇个二、三亩，遇到旱年头，那真是整天围着井台干着急。再说耕地吧，一头毛驴、一台耠子，一天耕个二亩来地就累得腰又酸、腿又疼。产量就没法提了。忙活一年，一亩小麦才收个百十来斤。等到工人老大哥给我们制造了七寸步犁、双轮双铧犁、马拉耘锄等一些新农具，产量才跟着一年高过一年。成立人民公社以后就更好了。工人老大哥都给送来了，拖拉机、收割机、脱粒机、锅驼机、电动机和大大小小的新式农具，耕地、浇地、整地、锄地等，都机械化、半机械化了。那真是又轻便又省劲，干起活来也从心眼里痛快。从产量上看，去年小麦的平均亩产量提高到三百八十五斤，甘薯达到平均亩产五千多斤。种了几十年的地，可是头一回见到我们这里的碱洼砂土地能打这么多的粮。
    我们生产发展的这么快，农具变化的这么大，刨刨根，问问底，不能不从心里感谢工人老大哥。从简单的农具，一步一步地又给我们生产半机械化、机械化的农具。党中央发出加速农业技术改造的号召以后，工业武装我们的劲头就更足了，要什么给什么，缺什么补什么。大伙都说：这是在给我们安翅膀，让我们飞得更快，和工业拉着手一块大跃进。提起工人们对我们的帮助，真能说它几大车。处处替我们着想，想的比我们还周到。这里举几件事吧。1957年小麦收到场上，赶上了连雨天，一连二十多天雨不停，把人急的不知怎么才好。这时工人开来了拖拉机，一天一夜就全部突击割完四百亩麦子。要不是工人老大哥及时的援助，社员们一年就白辛苦了。拿近事来说，去年浇麦的时候，只要机器一出毛病，无论是刮风下雨还是三更半夜，公社农具制修厂的工人一接着电话，就没有一次不马上赶来的。有时为了修理水泵，工人们在大冷天，卷起裤子就下到水里去。没别的说的，社员们只有当做榜样来好好学习。工厂修配机器、农具、运输车辆，做到一包到底。不仅这样，工人老大哥还经常了解我们的需要、征求对新式农具的意见，传授技术，制出了新农具还送到门上请我们鉴定。今天我们有了机器，有了大批的新式机械化、半机械化农具，不能不想到工人老大哥的辛苦，不能不归功于工业对农业技术改造的全面无私的援助。
    在我们加速实现农业技术改造当中，我们要以工人老大哥做榜样，努力生产更多的粮食来支援工业。
