Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 31st: The Qinghe Reservoir, a project to harness the Qinghe River, a tributary of the Liao River in Liaoning Province, has had its 1,610-meter-long dam built to the designed elevation of 137.9 meters, three years ahead of schedule. From now on, the fierce and violent Qinghe River will be forever tamed under the feet of the people, serving the cause of socialist and communist construction.

The Qinghe River flows through northern Liaoning Province. Because its upper reaches are very steep and the lower reaches are relatively flat, when mountain floods come, they surge down, causing frequent floods in Kaiyuan, Changtu, Tieling, Shenyang, Xinmin and other counties. In order to completely harness this harmful river, the state decided to build the Qinghe Reservoir in Kaiyuan County. The reservoir project includes three main projects: the dam, the aqueduct, and the spillway. This is a comprehensive utilization giant reservoir, mainly for industrial water supply, but also for flood control and irrigation. After completion, the storage capacity will reach 957 million cubic meters, which can not only completely control the Qinghe River and ensure that the downstream area is free from disasters in the event of a once-in-a-century flood, but also irrigate 35,000 hectares of paddy fields and build a small hydropower station.

The reservoir project started construction in May 1958, and 80% of the operations were mechanized. At present, the builders of the reservoir are braving the severe cold to speed up the finishing touches such as the block stone slope protection of the reservoir dam, the filter dam site downstream of the dam, and the widening of the spillway, striving to complete all the reservoir projects within this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, January 31st: Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region's largest irrigation project, the Ili River South Bank Canal, has begun construction. Its first phase of construction started on January 7 and is expected to be completed in September this year.

This canal is located in Gongliu and Chabuchar counties in the Ili River Valley. The entire project includes a 170-kilometer-long canal with a design flow of 250 cubic meters per second; and 38 gates, dams, bridges, culverts and other structures. The earth and stone work of the main canal reaches 53.81 million cubic meters. The deepest excavation along the line is more than 60 meters, and the highest filling is more than 40 meters, with a total length of 55 kilometers of deep cutting and high construction. After the completion of the project, the roaring Tekes River will be cut off at the Kalabula ferry, and according to people's will, it will turn its head westward, pass through the foothills of the Ishkilik Mountains, cross the 81 mountains with an altitude of about 860 meters above sea level, and pass through the Chabuchar Great Wilderness, heading straight for the Honghaigou on the Sino-Soviet border. This canal is 50 meters wide and can accommodate 20-ton to 100-ton ships. Therefore, it is not only a huge irrigation canal, but also a prairie canal.

Gongliu and Chabuchar counties have fertile land, mild climate, and are suitable for growing crops such as wheat, corn, rice, cotton, sugar beets, and peanuts. After the South Bank Canal is built, it can directly increase the irrigated area by more than 3.2 million mu and improve the irrigated area by more than 570,000 mu. The autonomous region also plans to use the drop of the canal water to build 27 hydropower stations to supply local industrial electricity and residential lighting. Make the beautiful Ili River Valley more prosperous and rich.

    辽宁人民变清河水患为水利
    清河水库大坝提前三年基本竣工，全部工程年内完成
    新疆最大灌溉工程伊犁河南岸大渠动工
    据新华社沈阳31日电　辽宁省根治辽河支流——清河的清河水库，长达一千六百一十米的拦河大坝，已经提前三年筑到一百三十七点九米的设计高程。从此，水库工程基本竣工。凶猛狂暴的清河将永远驯服在人民的脚下，为社会主义共产主义建设事业服务。
    清河流经辽宁省北部。由于它的上游坡度很陡，下游比较平缓，山洪一来，汹涌而下，使开原、昌图、铁岭、沈阳、新民等县经常遭受水灾。为了彻底根治这条害河，国家决定在开原县境内修建清河水库。水库工程包括拦河大坝、输水道、溢洪道三大主体工程。这是一座以供给工业用水为主，兼作防洪、灌溉用的综合利用巨型水库。建成后，蓄水量可达九亿五千七百万立方米，不但可以完全治服清河水患，保证下游在百年一遇的洪水情况下免受灾害，还能灌溉稻田三万五千公顷，建筑一座小型水电站。
    水库工程是1958年5月开工兴建的，80％的作业采用机械化施工。目前，水库的建设者们正冒着严寒，加紧水库拦河大坝块石护坡、大坝下游滤水坝址和溢洪道加宽扩开等扫尾工程，争取今年内全部完成水库工程。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐31日电　新疆维吾尔自治区最大的灌溉工程——伊犁河南岸大渠开始动工兴建。它的第一期工程在1月7日开工，预计今年9月份完成。
    这个大渠在伊犁河谷的巩留和察布查尔两县境内。全部工程包括长达一百七十公里的渠道，它的设计流量为二百五十秒公方；还有三十八座闸、坝、桥涵等建筑物。干渠土石方达五千三百八十一万立方米，沿线挖方最深的地方达六十多米，填方最高的地方有四十多米，深劈高筑总长五十五公里。工程竣工后，咆哮的特克斯河将在卡拉布拉渡口处被拦腰斩断，按照人们的意志扭头向西，经伊什基里克山麓，越过八十一座拔海八百六十米左右的山峦，穿过察布查尔大荒原，直奔位于中苏边境的洪海沟。这条水渠面宽五十米，能通行二十吨至一百吨的轮船。因此，它不仅是一条巨大的灌溉渠道，又是一条草原运河。
    巩留和察布查尔两县土地肥沃，气候温和，适宜于种植小麦、玉米、水稻、棉花、甜菜、花生等作物。南岸大渠修成后，可以直接增加灌溉面积三百二十多万亩，改善灌溉面积五十七万多亩。自治区还准备利用渠道水的落差建筑水电站二十七座，供应当地工业用电和居民照明用电。使美丽的伊犁河谷更加繁荣富饶。
