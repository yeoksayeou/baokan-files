    Oppose America's Plundering Policies in Latin America
    South American People Tell Eisenhower to Get Out
    Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, February 26th: According to newspaper reports, on the eve of Eisenhower's visit to Argentina, the Progressive Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, and other political parties organized "lightning" rallies in Buenos Aires to condemn Eisenhower's visit and distributed leaflets with "Eisenhower Get Out" printed on them.
    Newspapers also reported that a total of tens of thousands of police officers will be deployed in Buenos Aires and Mar del Plata, which Eisenhower will visit, along the roads that Eisenhower's car will pass.
    According to reports, in order to avoid encountering demonstrations and protests by the Argentine masses, Eisenhower has changed his original plan to enter the city by car and will take a helicopter directly from the suburban airport to the American Embassy. According to the "Razón" newspaper, U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation agents have taken "security measures" in the Argentine Congress because Eisenhower is scheduled to deliver a speech there on the afternoon of the 26th.
    Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, February 25th: As U.S. President Eisenhower is about to visit Argentina, the Argentine University Federation issued a statement saying that the Argentine people and students will not welcome Eisenhower and that they "condemn the policies of the (U.S.) State Department and the U.S. big trusts." The foreign policy proposed by Eisenhower "completely violates the legitimate interests of the people of Latin American countries."
    The statement said that treaties forced upon the people of Latin American countries by American monopoly capital groups using armed forces many times are "exploitation upon exploitation." The statement said that as long as the International Monetary Fund manipulates the Argentine economy, as long as military bases are established, the Fourth Point Plan is imposed, and the life of Argentine universities is interfered with, the relationship between Argentina and the United States cannot be improved.
    The National Youth Organization of the ruling Intransigent Radical Civic Union and the Youth League of the Progressive Democratic Party also issued statements condemning the United States and Eisenhower's visit.
    Xinhua News Agency, February 26th: Rio de Janeiro News: The Brazilian public continues to criticize Eisenhower's visit to Brazil.
    The Student Union of the State of São Paulo issued a declaration on the 24th saying: Brazil's biggest problem is its underdeveloped state, and it is primarily the North American international trusts that are in fact hindering Brazil's economic development. The declaration reminded Eisenhower to pay attention to the harmful role these trusts play in the Brazilian economy. The declaration stated that most of the American capital entering Brazil in the name of investment only serves to damage Brazil's resources, which are just being developed. The "Brazilian Daily" published an editorial on the 25th saying that the American public should know that Brazil is unwilling to rely on exporting raw materials indefinitely.
    The weekly "New Orientation" wrote on the 25th: The purpose of Eisenhower's visit is to strengthen North America's imperialist position in Brazil and to further subordinate Brazil's foreign policy to American interests. One of its conspiracies is to oppose Brazil's national monopoly on oil, and another purpose is to have Brazil support American intervention in Cuba.
      "New Orientation" weekly wrote: In the current situation in Brazil, in order for Eisenhower's visit to truly help the rapprochement between the two countries, it is first necessary to abolish the entire plundering institution that dominates the Washington government, which is deeply rooted in Brazil.
    Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, February 25th: The National Leadership Body of the United Workers' Confederation of Chile issued a statement announcing that Eisenhower's visit is not welcomed by Chilean workers.
    The statement said, "Faced with the visit that the President of the United States will make to our country, considering the imperialist economic plundering policy that the United States government has implemented towards our country and other Latin American countries—a policy that is inconsistent with Mr. Eisenhower's high-sounding remarks about good neighbors, democracy, and fraternity towards the peoples of all countries, the United Workers' Confederation announces: The visit of the President of the United States to our country is not welcomed by Chilean workers."
    The statement said, "The United Workers' Confederation condemns his foreign policy, which is based on the most despicable imperialist plunder of the peoples of Latin American countries; condemns the attempts of the United States government to interfere in the internal affairs of these countries, such as the current treatment of the heroic Cuban people, whose revolution for economic liberation has the support and assistance of the people of our continent, and the situation in Puerto Rico, which is fighting to get rid of the colonial rule maintained by the United States government, which violates the principle of national self-determination enshrined in the great Declaration of Human Rights."
    Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, February 26th: As Eisenhower is about to visit Chile, anti-American slogans have appeared here. In Baquedano Square in the capital, a huge banner was hung with the words: "Down with U.S. Imperialism!" Today, the police removed the banner after discovering it.
    Xinhua News Agency, February 26th: Montevideo News: On the eve of U.S. President Eisenhower's visit to Uruguay, many slogans such as "Ike, Go Home!" and "Imperialists, Get Out!" appeared on the road from the airport near Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, to the city center on the 25th. This road is the road that Eisenhower is scheduled to pass when he arrives in Montevideo on March 2nd.

    反对美国在拉丁美洲的掠夺政策
    南美人民喝令艾森豪威尔滚出去
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯26日电　据报纸报道，阿根廷进步民主党、社会党等政党组织在艾森豪威尔到达阿根廷访问的前夕，在布宜诺斯艾利斯举行了“闪电”集会，谴责艾森豪威尔的访问，同时散发了印有“艾森豪威尔滚出去”的传单。
    报纸还报道说，在布宜诺斯艾利斯和艾森豪威尔将去访问的马德普拉塔总共将出动上万名警察在艾森豪威尔乘汽车经过的路上布防。
    据报道，为了避免遭遇阿根廷群众的示威抗议，艾森豪威尔已改变原定乘汽车入城的计划而将乘直升飞机从郊外机场直接前往美国大使馆。据“理性报”报道说，美国联邦调查局的特务人员又在阿根廷议会中采取“安全措施”，因为艾森豪威尔定于26日下午在那里发表讲话。
    据新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯25日电　在美国总统艾森豪威尔即将访问阿根廷的时候，阿根廷大学生联合会发表声明说，阿根廷人民和学生不会欢迎艾森豪威尔，他们“谴责（美国）国务院和美国大托辣斯的政策”。艾森豪威尔提出的外交政策，“是完全违反拉丁美洲国家人民的合法利益的”。
    声明说，美国垄断资本集团多次使用武装部队强要拉丁美洲国家人民接受的条约是“剥削再剥削”。声明说，只要国际货币基金组织操纵着阿根廷经济，只要军事基地被建立、第四点计划被强加推行和干涉阿根廷大学的生活，阿根廷和美国的关系不可能得到改善。
    执政党不妥协激进公民联盟全国青年组织和进步民主党青年联盟也发表声明，谴责美国，谴责艾森豪威尔访问。
    据新华社26日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西公众继续抨击艾森豪威尔对巴西的访问。
    圣保罗州学生联合会24日发表宣言说：巴西的最大的问题是不发达状态，而主要是北美的国际托辣斯在事实上阻挠着巴西的经济发展。宣言提醒艾森豪威尔注意这些托辣斯在巴西经济中所起的有害作用。宣言说，大部分以投资为名输入巴西的美国资本，只是对刚刚在开发的巴西的资源起破坏作用。“巴西日报”25日发表社论说，应该让美国的公众知道，巴西不愿意无限期地依靠出口原料过日子。
    “新方针”周刊25日写道：艾森豪威尔的访问的目的是加强北美在巴西的帝国主义阵地，使巴西的外交政策进一步从属于美国的利益。其阴谋之一是反对巴西对石油的国家垄断，另一个目的是要巴西支持美国干涉古巴。
      “新方针”周刊写道：在巴西目前所处的情况下，要使艾森豪威尔的访问真正有助于两国的接近，首先必须取消在华盛顿政府中占优势的整个掠夺机构，这种机构在巴西是根深蒂固的。
    据新华社圣地亚哥25日电　智利工人统一工会全国领导机构发表声明，宣布艾森豪威尔的访问不受智利工人的欢迎。
    声明说，“面对着美国总统将对我国进行的访问，考虑到美国政府对我国和拉丁美洲其他各国所执行的帝国主义经济掠夺政策——这种政策同艾森豪威尔先生所发表的关于好邻居、民主和对各国人民的兄弟情谊的冠冕堂皇的言论不相称，工人统一工会宣布：美国总统对我国的访问是不受智利工人欢迎的。”
    声明说，“工人统一工会谴责他的以对拉丁美洲各国人民进行最卑鄙的帝国主义掠夺为基础的对外政策；谴责美国政府干涉这些国家内政的图谋，例如目前对待英勇的古巴人民那样，古巴人民的经济解放的革命得到我们大陆各国人民的支持和援助。又如对待波多黎各的情况，波多黎各正为摆脱美国政府所保持的、违背伟大的人权宣言中神圣规定了的人民自决原则的殖民统治而斗争。”
    新华社圣地亚哥26日电　在艾森豪威尔快要访问智利的时候，这里出现了反对美国的标语。在首都的巴克达诺广场上，悬挂了一幅巨大的标语牌，上面写着：“打倒美帝国主义！”今天警察在发现后把这幅标语取下了。
    据新华社26日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：在美国总统艾森豪威尔到乌拉圭访问的前夕，从乌拉圭首都蒙得维的亚附近的机场通往市中心的大路上，25日出现了许多“艾克，滚回去！”和“帝国主义者，滚开！”等标语。这条大路是艾森豪威尔预定在3月2日到达蒙得维的亚时必须经过的路。
