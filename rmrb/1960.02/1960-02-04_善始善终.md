　　Finishing Well
　　Currently, the winter water conservancy tasks in many regions have been largely completed. Properly completing the finishing touches and ensuring a good start and a good finish are of great significance for the fastest possible realization of the irrigation function of newly built projects.
　　To do a good job of finishing touches, it is first necessary to conduct ideological education among the vast number of cadres and laborers, so that they recognize that only by adhering to high work efficiency and excellent quality from beginning to end can the newly built water conservancy projects exert their irrigation effectiveness as quickly as possible. In particular, it is necessary to emphasize "coordination" to ensure that water can be stored and fields irrigated according to the original plan after completion. The construction of a new reservoir generally involves projects such as dams, spillways, and canals, and some also have auxiliary dams. If we leave a "tail," for example, if we do not open the spillway properly, we will not dare to store water; if the canal is not opened properly, even if water is stored, it will not flow into the fields. Secondly, it is necessary to check the quality of the project again to ensure that the newly built project can store water, control floods, and not collapse, crumble, or leak. If any quality problems are found, resolutely rework and "make up the lesson" immediately. Thirdly, strike while the iron is hot, accomplish the task at one go, adjust and establish organizations and systems for water use and management, and store water as soon as possible. Fourthly, clean up and keep the tools properly.
　　We firmly believe that as long as the leadership pays attention to it, promptly solves the ideological problems of cadres and the masses, and strengthens specific leadership work, we will surely be able to achieve a good start and a good finish.

    善始善终
    现在，许多地区的冬修水利任务已基本完工。妥善地作好扫尾工程，做到善始善终，对于最快地发挥新建工程的灌溉作用，有着很重要的意义。
    做好扫尾工程，首先要在广大干部和民工中做好思想教育，使他们认识到自始至终坚持高工效、优质量，才能使新建水利工程最快地发挥灌溉效能。尤其要强调“配套”，保证完工后能根据原来的计划蓄水灌田。新建一个水库，一般有大坝、溢洪道、渠道等工程，有的还有副坝。如果我们留下一个“尾巴”，例如没有把溢洪道开好，就不敢蓄水；渠道没有开好，即使蓄了水也流不进田里去。其次，要再一次检查工程质量，保证新建工程能蓄水、拦洪、不崩不塌不漏，发现有质量不好的地方，坚决立即返工“补课”。第三，趁热打铁，一鼓作气，调整和建立用水管水的组织和制度，尽快蓄水。第四，清理和保管好工具。
    我们深信，只要领导重视，及时解决干部、群众中的思想问题，加强具体的领导工作，一定能做到善始善终。
