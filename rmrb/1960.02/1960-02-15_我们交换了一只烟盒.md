    We Exchanged a Cigarette Case
    Liang Sicheng

    It was an evening in late March of 1958. It was already past ten o'clock when I entered a hotel restaurant in Moscow. Coincidentally, it was a Saturday night, and the restaurant was still very crowded. Many of the people there seemed to be locals from Moscow rather than travelers. After a week of hard work, they came here to relax, have something to eat, drink a few glasses of wine, and dance. The restaurant was filled with melodious music, and couples danced in pairs to the rhythm, talking and laughing. The entire restaurant was filled with a pleasant "weekend atmosphere."

    I was on my way back to China from Prague, stopping in Moscow to change planes, which required a one-day stay. After getting off the plane and entering the city, I arrived at the hotel, already at ten o'clock. My translator and I hurried into the restaurant, planning to eat and then go to sleep.

    Next to our table sat two couples in their forties. As soon as the music started, one man and one woman went to dance, leaving the other man and woman sitting and talking. During the conversation, the man frequently looked in my direction. After looking for a while, he came over and sat next to me. After sitting down, he asked, "Are you Chinese?" I said yes. "From Beijing?" I said yes again. He suddenly reached out his hands, grabbed mine, and laughed happily, saying, "Excellent! Excellent! I've been sitting here for two hours tonight, and now I've finally found a good friend!" We didn't exchange names, but started talking.

    He expressed his respect for the victories achieved by the Chinese people in revolution and socialist construction with enthusiastic language. He said he was "just an ordinary Soviet person, an ordinary Communist Party member," but he loved China and the Chinese people. In the conversation, I found that he was very familiar with many of our country's achievements, such as the Huai River water conservancy project, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, Anshan Iron and Steel, the Changchun First Automobile Factory, and the plan for taming the Yellow River. I asked him if he had been to China, and he said no, but going to China was his greatest wish.

    While talking, he took out a cigarette case and wanted to smoke. When I saw it, I immediately rushed to open my cigarette case. He took one, looked at it, and said, "Chinese cigarette! Very good cigarette!" Then, I took one myself. He immediately rushed to offer me his cigarette, and I had to put down my own and take his. When I lit his cigarette with my lighter, he also struck a match, and we crossed our arms, lighting each other's cigarettes.

    Soon, the music stopped, and the other two returned from dancing. Our friend suddenly stood up, went over to greet them, and took the woman's arm, leading her to our table to introduce her as his wife. The woman said a little shyly, "Let me introduce myself." Then, she told me her and her husband's names. Finally, she said that tomorrow was Sunday and invited me to spend Sunday at their home. Since I had to continue our journey the next day, I had to politely decline.

    We continued talking, and this comrade picked up my cigarette case—it was just a cheap aluminum one—and looked at it inside and out. Then, he pushed his copper-plated silver cigarette case, which was obviously quite old, in front of me. Without saying a word, he winked at me and put my cigarette case in his pocket. I smiled at him and put his cigarette case in my pocket. At this moment, he suddenly hugged me. I am small and thin, and he was a big man, and so strong, he almost squeezed me painfully, making it hard to breathe.

    We said goodbye. The couple repeatedly urged me to visit them next time I went to Moscow. I also said that I hoped to welcome them in Beijing. Unfortunately, a few months later, when I went to Moscow again, I realized after boarding the plane that I had changed notebooks, and the address was unclear. I had to wait for the next time to visit them.

    That night, my mood was restless for a long time, thinking of such a Soviet person whom I didn't know, meeting by chance, yet filled with such deep friendship from the bottom of his heart! The hearts of the Chinese and Soviet people are truly closely linked. This is our strength, the most powerful guarantee of world peace!

    On this auspicious day of the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, I cannot help but caress this precious gift—the cigarette case—and recall this pair of friends. What a lofty and great common ideal and friendship it symbolizes!

    我们交换了一只烟盒
    梁思成
    那是1958年3月下旬的一个晚上。已经十点多钟了，我走进莫斯科一个旅馆的餐厅。正巧这是星期六的晚上，餐厅里人还很多，其中许多人看来不是旅客，而像是莫斯科本市的人。他们在辛勤劳动了一周之后，到这里来休憩一下，吃点东西，喝几杯酒，跳跳舞。餐厅里音乐悠扬，人们一双双地跟着节拍旋转着，说说笑笑。整个餐厅里洋溢着愉快的“周末气氛”。
    我是在从布拉格回国的旅途中，在莫斯科换飞机，需要停留一天。下机后进入市区，到达旅馆，已经十点钟了。我和翻译同志匆匆走进餐厅，准备在吃完饭就去睡觉。
    我们旁边一桌坐着两对四十多岁的客人。乐声一起，其中一男一女就去跳舞，剩下一男一女坐着谈话。在谈话中，那位男客频频向我这方向看，看着看着，他就走了过来，在我旁边坐下了。他坐下后问：“你是中国人吗？”我说是。“从北京来的吗？”我又说是。他突然伸出双手，把我的手拉住，高兴地大笑说：“好极了！好极了！我今晚上在这里坐了两个钟头，现在可找到了好朋友了！”我们没有互通姓名，就谈了起来。
    他以热情的语言，向我们表达了他对中国人民革命和社会主义建设中取得的胜利的敬意。他说他“只是一个普通的苏联人，一个普通的共产党员”，但他热爱中国，热爱中国人。在谈话中，我发现他对我国的许多成就，如淮河的水利建设、武汉长江大桥、鞍钢、长春第一汽车制造厂，以及治理黄河的规划等等都很熟悉。我问他是否到过中国，他说没有，但是到中国去是他一个最大的愿望。
    在谈话的时候，他取出一只香烟盒，想要吸烟。我看见了，立刻抢着把我的烟盒打开。他拿了一支，看了看说：“中国烟！很好的烟！”接着，我自己也拿了一支。他立刻抢着把他的香烟递给我，我只好放下自己的烟，拿了他一支烟。我打着了打火机给他点烟的时候，他也划了一根火柴，和我彼此交叉着手臂，把对方口中的烟点着。
    不久，音乐停止，另外两人舞罢回来。我们这位朋友忽然站起来，走过去迎着他们，挽着那位妇女的手臂走到我们桌上，向我介绍他的夫人。那妇女有点不好意思地说：“我来自我介绍一下吧。”接着，她告诉我她和她丈夫的名字。最后，她说明天是星期日，邀请我到他们家去度星期天。由于我第二天就要继续我们的旅程，只好婉言谢辞。
    我们又继续谈话，这位男同志拿起我那个烟盒——那只是一只廉价的铝制品，里里外外地看了看，接着就把他的铜质镀银的但显然用了很久的烟盒推到我面前，一句话不说，对我挤挤眼，就把我的烟盒放进他的口袋里去了。我也对他笑了笑，把他的烟盒装进我的口袋里。这时他忽然把我拥抱起来。我身材瘦小，他是一个大个子，力气又那么大，简直把我拥抱得发痛，喘不过气来。
    我们告别了。他们夫妇再三叮咛我下次到莫斯科，一定要去看他们。我也说希望在北京欢迎他们。遗憾的是，几个月之后，我又去莫斯科，上了飞机才想起已经换了一个笔记本，住址记不清，只好再等下次去拜访他们了。
    那晚上，我的心情久久不能平静，想到这样一个素不相识的苏联人，萍水相逢，却洋溢着这样从心底发出来的深厚友谊！中苏人民的心同心真是紧紧地联系在一起的。这就是我们的力量，就是世界和平的最有力的保证！
    在这中苏友好同盟互助条约签订十周年的好日子，我不禁又抚玩着这个珍贵的礼物——烟盒，回忆起这一对朋友。它所象征的是多么崇高伟大的一个共同理想和友谊呀！
