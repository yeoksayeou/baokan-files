    Cupping Therapy
    Qin Baolin

    As far back as thousands of years ago, when humans couldn't possibly conceive of concepts like "atmospheric pressure" and "vacuum," the working people of our country scientifically utilized "horn suction tubes" or "cupping" in medical practice to create negative pressure points approaching a certain degree of "vacuum" on the surface of human skin. Through this stimulation, they adjusted bodily functions, thereby achieving the purpose of treating diseases. This is the traditional "fire cupping" therapy of traditional Chinese medicine.

    Even today, a proverb circulates among the people of our country: "Scraping and cupping cure most illnesses." Anyone who has been to the countryside knows that when someone suffers from wind-cold, cold, headaches, and body aches, some elderly women often skillfully find some small bottles, jars, and other containers with smooth edges, light a small piece of straw paper and throw it inside, then quickly place it on the patient's forehead or back to treat the illness. After "fire cupping" treatment, the patient does feel refreshed and may even be cured. If you have the opportunity to travel to ethnic minority areas in the border regions, you will also see "horn suction tubes" made of mountain goat horns and yellow cattle horns, similarly used to treat people.

    The tools for "fire cupping" therapy were initially made of animal horns, so they were called "horn method" in ancient times. The various treatment methods in Ge Hong's "Emergency Formulas to Keep Up One's Sleeve" from the Jin Dynasty often combined "horn method" with "acupuncture." It is said that the book "Emergency Formulas to Keep Up One's Sleeve" was written based on the remaining ideas of Qin Yueren's "Formulas to Keep Up One's Sleeve" from the Warring States period. This shows that as early as one or two thousand years ago, horn suction therapy had already entered the hands of professional doctors from folk therapy and was used as a routine treatment. By the Tang Dynasty, this therapy was more widely used. For example, Wang Tao's "External Medical Secrets" contains a very detailed description of the horn method, citing the specific operation of using "bamboo suction tubes" to treat pulmonary tuberculosis. According to the "Tang Code," "horn method" was even listed as one of the formal medical subjects by the state at that time. Later, the "Su Shen Liang Fang" written by Shen Kuo and Su Shi in the Song Dynasty also included the fire tube method for treating chronic coughs. By the Qing Dynasty, Zhao Xuemin's "Compendium of Materia Medica - Supplements" included an entry on "fire cupping," specifically discussing its therapeutic effects and indications. From the records in traditional Chinese medicine literature and the reality of folk medicine, although the tools used in this therapy vary, including animal horns, bamboo tubes, earthenware jars, and glass cups, they all use the principle of fire cupping to treat diseases.

    Using fire cupping for treatment can not only utilize locally available materials, but the operation is also very simple. For general simple treatment, you can find some closed containers with smooth edges, such as small bottles, jars, bamboo tubes, glass cups, etc. After cleaning (disinfecting), light a piece of paper or a fire twist and put it into the tube to burn it for a while, so that the air in the tube expands and escapes due to the heat. Then, quickly cover the tube on the skin. At this time, the tube will tightly adhere to the skin due to the thin air inside and the resulting negative pressure. After about ten minutes of suction, press the skin at the mouth of the tube with your hand and slightly pull it open to let air in, then you can gently remove it. Usually, the areas for horn suction, such as seasonal colds, headaches, dizziness, general weakness, and sore joints, can be selected to suction the temples on both sides of the forehead, back, waist, legs, etc., or suction the areas where the patient feels pain and swelling.

    The use of fire cupping therapy in hospitals or clinics is based on the principle of "meridians" in traditional Chinese medicine to coordinate with acupoint selection, which gives it a wider range of application value in clinical medicine. Key indications that have been studied include: circulatory disorders and deep congestion, respiratory system inflammation, muscle and nerve pain, gastritis and gastric dysfunction, and symptomatic treatment for general symptoms. However, it must be based on syndrome differentiation and treatment to achieve better results.

    Why can "fire cupping" cure diseases? According to preliminary research, this is because a negative pressure is formed inside the suction tube during treatment, which has a fairly strong attraction. It can draw the blood and lymph from the deep organs and tissues of the human body to the surface of the skin, thereby promoting circulation and changing the state of congestion. At the same time, the artificially formed "blood stasis" gradually causes autolysis, which can produce sustained benign stimulation to the body, and through the reflex mechanism of higher nerves, stimulate, change, and adjust the functions of the body. In this way, the effect of eliminating diseases and restoring health can be achieved.

    拔火罐
    覃保霖
    远在数千年以前，人类还不可能设想到“大气压力”、“真空”这一类概念的时候，我国劳动人民在医疗实践中，竟科学地运用了“角吸筒”或“拔火罐”在人体皮肤表面上造成接近于某些程度“真空”的负压点，通过这种刺激来调整身体机能，从而达到治疗疾病的目的。这就是祖国医学传统的“火罐气”疗法。
    我国民间至今还流传着这样的谚语：“刮痧拔罐，病好大半”。到过农村的人都会知道，当有人遇到风寒感冒、头痛身疼的时候，有些老大娘们，常是很熟练地找上一些小瓶、小罐等口缘平整的容器，点燃一小片草纸投进去，便迅速地让它扣在病人的头额或背腰等处来治病。经过“火罐气”治疗之后，病人确是感到一身轻快，甚至把病治好了。如果你有机会到边疆少数民族地区走一趟，还会看到用山羊角、黄牛角做成的“角吸筒”，同样地用来给人们治病。
    “火罐气”疗法的工具最初是采用兽角做成的，所以古代称为“角法”。晋代葛洪所著“肘后备急方”一书中的各种治病法，就常有“角法”与“针灸”并用。据说“肘后备急方”这本书是根据战国时代秦越人的“肘后方”遗意撰成，可见远在一二千年以前，角吸法就已经由民间疗法进入到专业医生手里，用作常规治疗了。到了唐代，这一疗法得到更广泛的运用，如王焘所著“外台秘要”一书中，对角法有很详细的记述，举出用“竹吸筒”治疗肺痨的具体操作。据“唐六典”所载，当时“角法”还由国家规定列为正规医学的科目之一。后来，宋代沈括和苏轼所著的“苏沈良方”中也列有治久嗽火筒法。到了清代赵学敏著“本草纲目拾遗”收录“火罐气”一条，专门论述其治疗作用和适应症。从祖国医学文献记述和民间医疗实况看，这一疗法所使用工具虽有兽角、竹筒、瓦罐、玻璃杯之分，但都是采用火罐气的原理来治疗的。
    运用火罐气治疗，不但可以就地取材，而且操作也很简便。一般简易治疗可找些平整口缘的密闭容器如小瓶、小罐、竹筒、玻璃杯等，经过清洁（消毒）处理后，用纸片或火捻子点燃放进筒里烧一下，让筒内空气遇热膨胀外逸，即迅速将筒复盖在皮肤上，这时由于筒内空气稀薄而呈现负压，便会紧吸在皮肤上，吸住十分钟左右，再用手按压筒口处皮肤，并稍为拔开一点让空气进去，就可以轻轻地取下了。通常角吸的部位，如四时感冒、头痛眩晕、周身软困、骨节酸疼等，可选吸前额二侧太阳穴、背部、腰部、腿弯等处，或吸病人感到疼痛酸胀的位处。
    在医院或门诊部运用火罐气治疗，是按照中医“经络”原理来配合取穴，在临床医疗上就有了更广泛的施用价值。经研究过的重点适应症有：循环障碍及深部郁血、呼吸系统炎症、肌肉与神经痛、胃炎及胃机能障碍、一般症状的对证治疗等。但须根据辨证论治，才能收到更好的效果。
    “火罐气”为什么能治好病呢？根据初步研究，认为这是由于施治的时候，吸筒内形成负压，具有相当强的引力，能将人体深部器官和组织的血液及淋巴液吸集在皮肤表面，因而促进循环作用，并改变郁血状态。同时所形成的人工“瘀血”，又逐渐引起自家溶化现象，能对机体产生持续的良性刺激，通过高级神经的反射机制而激发、改变、调整机体的功能。这样就可以达到消除疾病恢复健康的效果。
