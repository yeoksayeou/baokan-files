    "Hero" Gives Way
    Shandong Chipping, Cao Xueyi
    I was thrilled to read the news in the February 8th People's Daily about "Shanghai's Light Industry Massively Producing High-End Products." I was also deeply moved by the "Shanghai Brand, Welcome You!" article's "Hero Gives Way."

    What is so exhilarating? In just over a year, Shanghai has filled the "blank spots" in light industry, such as watches, cameras, film, and optical glass. Furthermore, a large number of higher quality products have emerged in gold pens, bicycles, sewing machines, and other products. The example of Shanghai massively producing high-end products is the herald of the great leap forward in the national light industry. It signifies the rapid improvement of the technological level of the motherland's light industry and the rapidly changing miracle, how could it not make people happy from the bottom of their hearts!

    And what are the feelings? After more than a year of hard work, last year, the Shanghai Huafu Gold Pen Factory made the Hero gold pen catch up with the American Parker pen in actual use. But today, the high-end product that has caught up with the international advanced level—the Hero gold pen—has to give up the national champion throne to the Shanghai brand gold pen that has come from behind. In the old days, when a capitalist factory produced a new product, after defrauding people's credit, it would eagerly cut corners to achieve the goal of making huge profits. When this product was finally spurned by the people, they had to find another trick, change new products, and go to deceive the masses, or be eaten by rival colleagues, resulting in bankruptcy. Their purpose of production was not for the masses of the people. But in our socialist society, the situation is completely different. The producer is the state, and the consumer is the people. Production is for the people, and when the output is high, it should be even higher, and when the quality is good, it can be even better. Furthermore, a new situation has emerged in which the backward catch up with the advanced, the advanced help the backward, the apprentices catch up with the masters, the small factories catch up with the big factories, a thriving and high-speed leap forward.

    The throne is the throne of the leap forward. The "Hero's" concession signifies the continuous improvement of the technical level. We hope that more "heroes" will give way, more "heroes" will ascend the throne, so that more industrial products will achieve rapid increases in output, and better product quality will take off together!

### “英雄”让位

    “英雄”让位
    山东茌平　曹学毅
    在2月8日人民日报上，读过“上海轻工业大造高级产品”的消息，叫人欢欣鼓舞；读过“上海牌，欢迎你！”文中的“英雄让位”，又很有感触。
    欢欣鼓舞的是：时间不过一年多，上海的手表、照像机、胶卷、光学玻璃等轻工业中的“空白点”已经被补上了；金笔、自行车、缝纫机等产品中又出现了大批质量更好的产品。上海大造高级产品的事例，是全国轻工业大跃进的先声，它标志着祖国轻工业技术水平的迅速提高、瞬息万变的奇迹，怎能不叫人从心底高兴！
    感触的又是什么呢？上海华孚金笔厂经过一年多的努力，在去年，使英雄金笔在实际使用方面赶上了美国的派克金笔。但是今天，赶上国际先进水平的高级产品——英雄金笔，又不得不把全国冠军的宝座，让给后来居上的上海牌金笔了。在旧时代，资本家工厂出产一种新产品，当骗取了人们的信誉之后，便亟力偷工减料，以达到谋取暴利的目的。等到这种产品最后被人们唾弃了，就不得不另找窍门，更换新产品，再去欺骗群众，或者被同行冤家吃掉，以致倒闭。他们生产的目的不是为了人民大众。但是在我们的社会主义社会里，情况完全不同。生产者是国家，消费者是人民。生产为人民，产量高了还要更高，质量好了可以更好。进而出现了后进赶先进，先进帮后进，徒工赶师傅，小厂赶大厂，欣欣向荣、高速度跃进的新局面。
    宝座，是跃进的宝座。“英雄”的让位，标志着技术水平的不断提高。我们希望更多的“英雄”让位，更多的“英雄”登上宝座；让更多的工业产品产量突飞猛进；让更好的产品质量比翼高飞！
