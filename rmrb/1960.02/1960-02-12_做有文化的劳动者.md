    Becoming Cultured Laborers

    Forgetting Roots, Turning Back Becomes a Local Expert

    Cheng Kuanniu, a young farmer from Qinggu Village in Wanrong County, is a good worker and an honest person. His father and grandfather both worked as long-term laborers for landlords, and he himself had begged for food with his mother. Only after liberation did he receive land, houses, and livestock, and begin to live a good life. However, he was not politically active and focused too much on personal interests.

    In January 1959, he learned the pinyin alphabet and then taught himself the "Phonetic Farmer Literacy Textbook," reaching the standard for literacy. In March, he began reading phonetic reading materials, the first of which was "Liu Jemei Forgets Roots, Turns Back," which inspired him greatly. He felt that he was similar to Liu Jemei, both having begged for food and both having turned over a new leaf under the leadership of the Communist Party, but only caring about himself. This was forgetting his roots. He felt he had let the Party down and was very upset. From then on, he was determined to serve the people honestly, doing whatever the Party asked him to do.

    In the same month, he also read the phonetic reading material "Heini Plants Cotton," which sparked the idea of setting up experimental fields. He planted four-tenths of a mu of cotton and one-tenth of a mu of sweet potatoes in experimental fields. Because he read the phonetic comic strips "How to Eliminate Cotton Aphids" and "How to Eliminate Red Spiders," he used "Ceresan" to treat the seeds to prevent insects in the cotton fields. When planting sweet potatoes, he created a "ridge planting method" based on the principle that sweet potatoes should grow in loose soil, as he had read in books. In order to get enough sunlight, he also propped up the sweet potato vines. In addition, he meticulously managed the experimental fields according to the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture.

    Although there were five hailstorms and a hundred-day drought last year, the yield of his cotton experimental field was still twice the local average yield, and the sweet potato experimental field was also one times higher. He was named a production pacesetter. The masses called him a local expert.

    From March 1959 to January this year, he read more than 150 phonetic and non-phonetic reading materials. According to the county's inspection on December 20 last year, he has learned more than 2,700 characters. In the past year, he has written more than 230 poems and clapper rhymes. He was also named a model student.

    After Cheng Kuanniu shook off illiteracy, his cultural and ideological level improved, and he changed like a different person, making great progress. He also made many creations in production. Last July, he became the deputy captain of the production team, and in December, he was admitted to the Party. (Shu)

    The Story in the Book Inspired Her

    Guo Huahua, a female commune member of the Wangxian People's Commune in Wanrong County, is a nineteen-year-old newlywed who was originally illiterate. After participating in phonetic literacy in 1958, she quickly became literate and read about a hundred phonetic reading materials, and also subscribed to the "Wanrong Pinyin Newspaper" and the "Hanyu Pinyin Newspaper" in Beijing, reading them carefully.

    After getting married last year, the commune assigned her to work in the pig farm. She didn't know how to raise pigs, and the pigs didn't listen to her. The large pigs often fought for food, and she would beat them indiscriminately, causing the pigs to be afraid to eat. The masses also reflected, saying, "How can a new daughter-in-law raise pigs! Raising pigs is dirty and not decent for her husband. It won't be long before she cries and goes home."

    She herself also wanted to quit this job, thinking it was better to work in the fields. However, one day she read the phonetic reading material "Model Feeder," and her thinking turned around. She was very moved by the deeds of the model feeder Long Muzhen in the book. She understood the importance of raising pigs and decided to learn from Long Muzhen.

    Afterward, she found some books on pig-raising techniques to read, and established a relationship with the pigs, never scaring them again. She threw away the pig-beating stick and instead used gentle calls and slow guidance, went deep into the pigsty to bathe the pigs, and also studied methods of adjusting feed, personally going to the wild to find weeds that pigs like to eat. From then on, the pigs listened to her, and the pigs' lives also became regular. In this way, she went from managing six pigs to managing thirty pigs, and all of them were healthy.

    Now she has been rated as a pig-raising model twice and a pacesetter once. (Zhong)

    做有文化的劳动者
    忘本回头变成土专家
    万荣县青谷村的青年农民程宽牛，劳动好，人也老实。他父祖两辈都给地主扛长工，自己跟母亲要过饭，解放后才分到土地房屋牲口，过了好日子。但是政治上不开展，个人利益考虑得多。
    1959年1月，他学会了拼音字母，接着就自学“注音农民识字课本”，达到扫盲标准。3月，他开始阅读注音读物，第一本读的是“刘介梅忘本回头”，受到很大启发。他觉得自己跟刘介梅差不多，都要过饭，都是靠共产党领导翻了身，却只顾自己，这就是忘本。他感到对不起党，心里很难受。从此，他下定决心，要老老实实的为人民服务，党叫他干啥，他就干啥。
    在同一个月，他又读了注音读物“黑妮种棉”，引起搞试验田的念头。他种了四分棉花、一分红薯的试验田，又因为读了注音连环画“怎样消灭棉蚜”和“怎样消灭红蜘蛛”，他用“赛力散”拌种，不让棉田生虫。他种红薯，根据书上看到的红薯要长在疏松的土壤中的道理，创造了一种“垅土插秧法”。又为了得到充足的阳光，把红薯架起来。此外，他又根据农业“八字宪法”细致地管理了试验田。
    虽然去年有五次雹灾，百日大旱，他的棉花试验田的产量仍旧高出当地平均亩产量的两倍，红薯试验田也高出一倍。被评为生产标兵。群众称他为土专家。
    从1959年3月到今年1月，他一共读了注音和不注音的读物一百五十多册。据去年12月20日县里检查的结果，证明他已识到两千七百多字。一年来他写的诗歌快板有两百三十多首。他又被评为学习模范。
    程宽牛摆脱文盲状态以后，提高了文化思想水平，像变了一个人一样，有了很大进步，生产上也有不少创造。去年7月当生产队副队长，12月被吸收入党。　（曙）
    书中的故事鼓舞了她
    万荣县王显人民公社女社员郭花花，是个十九岁的新媳妇，原来一字不识，1958年参加注音扫盲后，很快脱盲，而且先后读了百来本注音读物，还订了“万荣拼音报”和北京的“汉语拼音报”，认真阅读。
    去年结婚后，社里分配她到猪场工作。她不懂得养猪的方法，猪也不听她的话。大猪为了抢食，时常咬架，她就乱打，弄得猪不敢吃食了。群众也反映说：“新媳妇哪能养猪！养猪又脏，对她爱人也不体面，要不了多久，定会哭着回家的。”
    她自己也很想不干这工作，认为不如去地里干活。但是，有一天她读了“模范饲养员”那本注音读物，思想扭过来了。书中模范饲养员龙目珍的事迹，很使她感动。她懂得了养猪的重要性，决心学习龙目珍。
    以后她就找了一些养猪技术的书来看，并且和猪建立了感情，再也不吓唬它们。她把打猪的棒丢了，改为轻唤慢引，又深入猪圈给猪洗身子，还研究调食的方法，亲自到野外找猪爱吃的野草。从此，猪都听她的话了，猪的生活也有了规律。这样，她从管理六头猪增加到管理三十头猪，而且头头无病。
    现在她已被评了两次养猪模范，一次标兵。（中）
