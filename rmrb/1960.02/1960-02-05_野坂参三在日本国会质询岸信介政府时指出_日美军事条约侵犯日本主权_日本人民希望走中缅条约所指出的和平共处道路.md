Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 4th: Japanese Communist Party Chairman Sanzō Nosaka questioned the Kishi Nobusuke government at a plenary session of the Senate today, stating that the Kishi Nobusuke government's signing of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" was to suppress the Japanese people's struggle for peace, independence, and democracy, and to revive militarism and imperialism with the support of U.S. imperialism. He emphasized that the spearhead of the U.S.-Japan military alliance is directed against the rapidly developing socialist countries. However, he believes that the Kishi Nobusuke government's need to sign a new security treaty with the United States "precisely demonstrates their weakness and unstable position."

Nosaka, in explaining the current Asian situation, said that at the beginning of 1960, two important treaties were signed. One is the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression based on the principles of peaceful coexistence, and the other is the aggressive U.S.-Japan military treaty based on a "policy of strength." He stressed that the Japanese people hope that Japan will follow the path of peaceful coexistence, as indicated by the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression. He said that the Japanese Communist Party firmly opposes the ratification of the aggressive military treaty signed with the United States.

Nosaka, in refuting Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke's attempts to conceal the essence of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in his policy address, pointed out that the new treaty is not based on the principle of equality between Japan and the United States, because the new treaty stipulates that the United States can station troops anywhere in Japan. Nosaka said that even leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party have had to admit that Japan has not moved an inch towards independence as a result of the signing of this new treaty.

Nosaka condemned this new military alliance for infringing upon Japanese sovereignty.

Nosaka pointed out that the obligations of Japan stipulated in the Yoshida-Acheson Exchange of Notes of 1951 have been inherited by the new treaty, which is equivalent to Japan agreeing to unconditionally cooperate with any military action launched by the United States military in any region of the Far East under the guise of the "United Nations Forces." Therefore, it is quite natural that the Soviet Union and China have issued strong warnings to Japan regarding the signing of this treaty.

Nosaka, in referring to the Kishi Nobusuke government's slander of the Soviet Union's January 27th memorandum to Japan regarding the signing of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" as "violating international trust," emphasized that it is the Kishi Nobusuke government, not the Soviet Union, that is violating international trust, violating the Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration, and signing a U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty aimed at the Soviet Union.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 4th: The "Akahata" (Red Flag) newspaper published an editorial today, exposing Kishi Nobusuke's use of false peace rhetoric in his policy address at the regular session of the Japanese Diet to conceal the aggressive nature of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the fascist conspiracy to suppress the people.

The editorial said that just as the broad masses of the Japanese people feel the danger of being dragged into a new war due to the signing of the new "Security Treaty," and many members of the public in various countries around the world feel the danger of Japan's re-militarization, Kishi Nobusuke, in his policy address, turned black into white and stubbornly described this treaty as a treaty "for peace and freedom." The editorial pointed out that this shows that Kishi Nobusuke is desperately trying to disguise himself in order to deceive the Japanese people and the people of all countries around the world, and it also shows that even a cold war knight and militarist like Kishi Nobusuke has to sing a false peace tune today.

The editorial pointed out that the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is a U.S.-Japan military alliance aimed at aggression against China, the Soviet Union, and other countries. Due to the signing of this treaty, Japan will permanently become a U.S. military base, and will revive Japanese militarism and accelerate Japan's nuclear armament. In this situation, even if Kishi Nobusuke sings a hundred times of peace, and says that the new "Security Treaty" is in line with the spirit of the United Nations Charter, the Japanese people will not believe it.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 4th: The Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association and the Japan-China Cultural Relations Roundtable recently held executive committee meetings respectively, deciding to cooperate with the "Security Treaty Criticism Association" to further launch a struggle against the ratification and strive for the abolition of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

These two groups decided to jointly send a telegram in reply to the congratulatory telegram sent to them by ten Chinese cultural groups expressing support for the just struggle of the Japanese people. In their reply telegram, they expressed their determination to fight against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" and to strive for the early restoration of diplomatic relations with China.

### 野坂参三在日本国会质询岸信介政府时指出  日美军事条约侵犯日本主权  日本人民希望走中缅条约所指出的和平共处道路

    野坂参三在日本国会质询岸信介政府时指出
    日美军事条约侵犯日本主权
    日本人民希望走中缅条约所指出的和平共处道路
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本共产党主席野坂参三今天在参议院全体会议上向岸信介政府提出质询说，岸信介政府签订新的日美“安全条约”是为了镇压日本人民争取和平、独立和民主的斗争，为了在美帝国主义支持下复活军国主义和帝国主义。他强调指出，日美军事同盟的矛头是针对正在迅速发展的社会主义国家的。但是他认为岸信介政府必须同美国签订新的安全条约“正说明它们的薄弱和动荡不稳的地位”。
    野坂在说明现今的亚洲局面时说，在这1960年开头的时候，有两个重要的条约签字了。一个是以和平共处原则为基础的中缅友好和互不侵犯条约，另一个是以“实力政策”为基础的侵略性的日美军事条约。他强调说，日本人民希望日本走和平共处的道路，如中缅友好和互不侵犯条约所指出的。他说，日本共产党坚决反对批准同美国签订的侵略性的军事条约。
    野坂在驳斥岸信介首相在施政演说中掩盖日美“安全条约”的本质时指出，新条约并不是以日美平等的原则为基础的，因为新条约规定，美国可以在日本任何地方驻军。野坂说，连自由民主党的领导人也不得不说，日本并没有由于这个新条约的签订而向独立前进一寸。
    野坂谴责这个新的军事同盟侵犯了日本的主权。
    野坂指出，1951年吉田—艾奇逊换文中所规定的日本的义务，已经由新条约继承下来了，这等于是日本答应无条件地同美国军队盗用“联合国军”的名义在远东任何地区发动的任何军事行动进行合作。因此，苏联和中国就这个条约的签字向日本提出强烈警告，是十分自然的事。
    野坂在提到岸信介政府诽谤苏联1月27日就日美签订新“安全条约”向日本提出的备忘录是“不守国际信义”的说法时强调说，正是岸信介政府而不是苏联，不守国际信义，违背日苏共同宣言，而签订了以苏联为对象的日美军事同盟条约。
    据新华社4日讯　东京消息：“赤旗报”今天发表社论，揭露岸信介在日本国会平时会议上发表施政演说时用假和平的词句来掩盖新日美“安全条约”的侵略本质和镇压人民的法西斯阴谋。
    社论说，正当广大日本人民由于签订新“安全条约”而感到有被卷入新战争的危险、以及世界各国的许多公众都感到日本重新军国主义化的危险的时候，岸信介在施政演说中颠倒黑白地硬把这项条约说成是“为和平和自由”的条约。社论指出，这表明岸信介为了欺骗日本人民和全世界各国人民，正在拼命进行伪装，同时也表明今天连岸信介这样的冷战骑士和军国主义者也不得不唱起假和平的调子。
    社论指出，新日美“安全条约”是以侵略中苏等国为目的的日美军事同盟，由于这项条约的签订，日本将永久成为美国的军事基地，并且使日本军国主义复活，和加速日本的核武装。在这种情况下，尽管岸信介唱一百次和平调子，说什么新“安全条约”符合联合国宪章的精神，日本人民也不会相信的。
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：日中文化交流协会和日中文化关系恳谈会最近分别举行执行委员会会议，决定同“安全条约批判会”合作，进一步展开反对批准并且争取废除新日美“安全条约”的斗争。
    这两个团体决定联名打电报，答复中国十个文化团体拍给它们的表示支持日本人民正义斗争的贺电。它们在复电中表示为反对批准新“安全条约”和为争取早日恢复同中国的外交关系而斗争的决心。
