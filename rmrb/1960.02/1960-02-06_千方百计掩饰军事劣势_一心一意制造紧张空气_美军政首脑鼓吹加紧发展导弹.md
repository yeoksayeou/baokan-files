Comprehensive report from our newspaper: In the past half-month, the US Department of Defense, Congress, and newspapers have been embroiled in a dispute over the so-called "missile gap" and "deterrent gap" between the United States and the Soviet Union. Led by the new Secretary of Defense, Gates, military leaders have testified before congressional committees, doing their utmost to conceal the fact that the United States has lost its military superiority and lags far behind the Soviet Union in missiles and space exploration, further exposing the fact that the United States is stepping up its preparations for war, especially the development of missile weapons.

In mid-January, Secretary of Defense Gates testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee and the Senate Armed Services Committee, saying that, according to so-called new estimates, the Soviet Union's advantage in intercontinental ballistic missiles is not as great as previously estimated. Even if the Soviet Union possesses more long-range missiles than the United States in the next three years, it still cannot be considered that the Soviet Union surpasses or greatly exceeds the United States in military strength. To support his argument, Gates boasted that the United States "far surpasses" the Soviet Union in intercontinental and medium-range jet bombers, air-to-surface missiles, and naval power. Gates said, "There is no deterrent gap at present." Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Twining, who accompanied Gates to testify before the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, agreed with Gates' estimate. Gates' and Twining's assertion that the United States' military strength is not lagging behind was supported by US Air Force Secretary Sharp and CIA Director Allen Dulles. Eisenhower also stated at a press conference on January 26 that the United States' assessment of Soviet strength was more "accurate" than in the past, and that the United States should not "hang its head in shame" because of the Soviet Union's achievements. He even insisted that the United States had "caught up with and surpassed" the Soviet Union in many aspects of space exploration. However, much to the disappointment of the US Government, General Thomas S. Power, Commander-in-Chief of the Strategic Air Command, was not so "optimistic." He warned that if the Soviet Union possessed around 300 missiles, "it could destroy our entire nuclear offensive capability within thirty minutes." US Information Agency Director Allen also doubted whether the United States would be able to catch up with the Soviet Union in space in the next five or even ten years.

Gates' testimony "caused a storm in Congress and the press." Speaker of the House Rayburn believed that Gates' statement was "too complacent," and Republican Senator Javits criticized Gates for "not facing reality." The Democratic Party seized the opportunity to use it as campaign capital, accusing the Eisenhower administration's defense plans. Truman attacked the Eisenhower administration as "the worst US government since General Grant." Senator Symington, who served as Secretary of the Air Force in the Truman administration, believed that the "missile gap" was widening, not narrowing. New Jersey Governor Meyner lashed out at Eisenhower for "political bankruptcy," saying, "We may be on the road to becoming a second-rate nation."

According to reports from the United States and other Western news agencies, the US Congress's continuous investigations into the United States' missiles and other military aspects, as well as the uproar caused by Gates' testimony, were triggered by the Soviet Union's great achievements in intercontinental rockets and space exploration. The Soviet Union's successful launch of a powerful rocket into the Pacific Ocean made the US ruling group panic. Agence France-Presse sent a dispatch from Washington saying that the Soviet Union's successful test of a super rocket in the Pacific had caused the US government to "launch a nationwide propaganda campaign that could well be called 'telling the truth'," with the aim of "firstly reassuring American public opinion, allies, and non-aligned countries." However, whether it is the testimony of Pentagon military leaders or attacks from all sides on the Eisenhower administration's defense policy, they are all attempting to stir up war hysteria in order to step up preparations for war centered on missile development.

In his testimony and speeches, Gates revealed that the United States is expanding its supersonic bombers, providing more new weapons for ground troops, and putting submarines capable of launching "Polaris" missiles into active service, in order to "offset" the "gap" in intercontinental missiles. He emphasized the need to strive to "approach" the Soviet Union in the number of missiles around mid-1962. He said that the goal of the United States is to "maintain" the "retaliatory capability" for all-out war and the "capability" to wage "local wars" together with its allies. Gates also specifically mentioned the need to strengthen military deployments to "deal with" "limited wars" like those that occurred in Jinmen and Matsu in 1958. Gates indicated that the US government is now vigorously developing missiles, and one of the plans that "occupies a very high priority" is the "Polaris" missile system. Therefore, Gates declared that he opposes "negotiations with the Soviet Union that would lead to agreements that would allow us to relax our defense issues." Twining also clamored to "deal from a position of strength" in top-level negotiations.

Deputy Secretary of Defense Douglas clamored at a Republican gathering in Wichita, Kansas, on the evening of January 27 that the United States has built and maintained "military strength." He emphasized, "Our strategy is a strategy of deterrence." The United States must have a "long-range strike force to carry out retaliatory missions." "This force of ours rests primarily on the manned bombers of the Strategic Air Command, but long-range missiles are being added to our list, and the focus is beginning to shift from manned aircraft to missiles."

Strategic Air Command Commander Power, at a rally of the American Legion on January 28, advocated that the United States' nuclear bombers should maintain "airborne alert," that is, keeping most of the bombers in the air. Some congressmen, while criticizing Gates' estimates as "too optimistic," have demanded that "there should be an emergency plan to catch up" in missile development. Lippmann's commentary also worked particularly hard to advocate tightening the people's belts and increasing military spending. Eisenhower's remarks at a press conference on the 3rd fully confirmed that the US government is stepping up its efforts, especially focusing on the development of intercontinental and medium-range missiles, to change its backward position.

At the same time, the United States is making frantic efforts to reverse its decline in missile weapons. On January 26, the United States launched a total of five experimental intercontinental and medium-range missiles in one day. Among the five missiles launched were two "Atlas" intercontinental missiles, one "Redstone" missile, and one "Jupiter" medium-range missile.

    千方百计掩饰军事劣势　一心一意制造紧张空气
    美军政首脑鼓吹加紧发展导弹
    本报综合报道　最近半个月来，美国国防部、国会和报纸发生了一场所谓美国同苏联之间“导弹差距”和“威慑力量差距”的争吵。以新任国防部部长盖茨为首的军事首脑纷纷在国会的委员会上作证，竭力掩饰美国丧失军事优势，在导弹和空间探索方面大大落后于苏联的状况，进一步暴露了美国正在加紧进行备战活动，特别是发展导弹武器。
    美国国防部部长盖茨在上月中旬先后在众院拨款小组委员会和参院军事委员会作证时说，根据所谓新的估计，苏联在洲际弹道导弹方面的优势并不像以前估计的那么大，即使在今后三年内苏联拥有的远程导弹的数量将超过美国，仍然不能认为苏联在军事力量方面超过或者大大超过美国。为了支持他的这个论点，盖茨吹嘘美国在洲际和中程喷气轰炸机、空对地导弹和海军方面“遥遥领先”。盖茨说：“目前不存在威慑力量方面的差距”。陪同盖茨到众院国防拨款小组委员会作证的参谋长联席会议主席特文宁，同意盖茨的估计。盖茨和特文宁这种掩饰美国军事力量落后的论断，得到了美国空军部长夏普、美国中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯的支持。艾森豪威尔在上月26日记者招待会上，也表示美国对苏联力量的估计比过去“精确”，美国不应该因苏联的成就而“羞惭地低下头来”，他还硬说美国在空间探索的许多方面“赶上和超过了”苏联。但大煞风景的是，美国战略空军司令部司令鲍威尔却并不那么“乐观”，他警告说，苏联只要拥有三百枚左右的导弹，“就可以在三十分钟之内把我们的整个核进攻能力摧毁殆尽”。美国新闻署署长艾伦也怀疑今后五年甚至十年美国在空间方面能够赶上苏联。
    盖茨的作证，“在国会和报界引起了一个风潮”，众议院议长雷朋认为盖茨的说法“过于自满”，共和党参议员亚布罗抨击盖茨“不正视现实”。民主党乘机利用来作为竞选资本，纷纷指责艾森豪威尔政府的防务计划。杜鲁门攻击艾森豪威尔政府是“格兰特将军以来最糟的美国政府”。曾任杜鲁门政府空军部长的参议员薛明顿认为“导弹的距离”越来越大，而不是越来越小。新泽西州州长麦纳大骂艾森豪威尔“政治破产”，他说，“我们可能走上了成为第二等国家的道路”。
    据美国和其他西方通讯社的报道，美国国会对美国在导弹和其他军事方面的连续调查，以及盖茨作证所引起的轩然大波，是由于苏联在洲际火箭和空间探索方面的巨大成就所促发的，苏联在太平洋发射的强力火箭更使美国统治集团惶惶不安。法新社从华盛顿发出的一条电讯说，苏联在太平洋试验超级火箭的成功，使美国政府“在全国范围内发动一个很可能称为‘说明真相’的宣传运动”，其目的“首先是使美国舆论、盟国和没有承担义务的国家安心”。但不论是五角大楼的军事首脑的作证，还是各方面对艾森豪威尔政府的防务政策的攻击，都在企图掀起一阵战争歇斯底里，以便加紧进行以发展导弹为中心的备战活动。
    盖茨在作证和谈话中除了透露美国正在扩充超音速轰炸机，为地面部队提供更多新武器、把可以发射“北极星”式导弹的潜水艇编入现役，以“抵销”洲际导弹方面的“差距”之外，强调要争取在1962年年中前后在导弹数量上“接近”苏联。他说，美国的目标是：要与盟国一起“维持”进行全面战争的“报复能力”和进行“局部战争的能力”。盖茨还特别提到要加强军事部署“对付”像1958年在金门和马祖发生的那一类的“有限战争”。盖茨表明，美国政府现在正在大力发展导弹，而“占非常优先地位”的计划之一是“北极星式”导弹系统。因此，盖茨声言，他反对“同苏联之间的谈判将导致能够使我们放松防御问题的协议”。特文宁也叫嚷要在最高级谈判中“从实力出发来打交道”。
    美国国防部副部长道格拉斯1月27日晚上在堪萨斯州维契塔共和党人一个集会上发言时叫嚷说，美国建立并保持着“军事实力”，他强调说，“我们的战略是威慑战略”，美国必须拥有一支“执行报复任务的远程出击力量。我们这种力量首先寄托在战略空军司令部的有人驾驶的轰炸机身上，但是远程导弹正在列入我们的清单，而且重点已经开始从有人驾驶的飞机移向导弹”。
    战略空军司令部司令鲍威尔1月28日在美国退伍军人团的集会上鼓吹美国的核轰炸机要保持“空中警戒”，就是把大部分轰炸机留在空中。一些议员，在指责盖茨的估计“太乐观”时，都要求在发展导弹方面“应该有一个迎头赶上的紧急计划”。李普曼的评论也鼓吹紧勒人民腰带，增加军费上特别卖力。艾森豪威尔在3日记者招待会上的谈话，完全证实了美国政府正在加紧努力，特别是致力于发展洲际和中程导弹，以改变它所处的落后地位。
    与此同时，美国正在进行疯狂的努力来挽救它在导弹武器方面的颓势。1月26日，美国在一天中共发射了五枚试验性的洲际导弹和中程导弹。在发射的五枚导弹中，包括两枚“阿特拉斯”式洲际导弹，一枚“红石”式和一枚“丘辟特”式中程导弹。
