Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 2nd: Military Prosecutor Air Force Major Prjoro Radonono demanded at the Jakarta Military Court on the 1st that American pilot Pope, who participated in the Indonesian rebellion, be sentenced to death.

The Military Prosecutor pointed out that Pope participated in the armed rebellion against the legitimate government of Indonesia. His bombings of Indonesian territory in April and May 1958 caused significant loss of life and property. Pope consciously participated in the rebellion under the guise of "anti-communism."

He pointed out that Pope's crimes proved that foreigners helped and interfered in the Indonesian rebellion. He recalled the speech made by the Indonesian Prime Minister in 1958, which mentioned that American pilots used planes taking off from Taiwan to attack Indonesia, and that the rebels' planes and automatic weapons were also shipped from Taiwan. He pointed out that the Indonesian government had requested the United States to adopt a non-interference attitude towards the Indonesian issue.

The Military Prosecutor pointed out that all the evidence proves that Pope's crimes are conclusive and serious. Therefore, Pope should be given the most severe punishment as a response to foreign interference.

The Military Court will hear the defendant's lawyer's defense on February 22nd.

Jakarta's "People's Daily" today expressed support for the Military Prosecutor's request in an editorial. The editorial said, "What right did the Americans have to bomb Indonesia? Even if Pope only bombed Indonesia once, he should be sentenced to death." The "Youth Daily" published an editorial entitled "A Reasonable Punishment," saying that no other punishment would be more appropriate than the prosecutor's request for Pope.

    雅加达军事检察官要求
    判处参预叛乱的美犯波普死刑
    新华社雅加达2日电　军事检察官普罗若腊多诺空军少校1日在雅加达军事法庭上要求把参加印度尼西亚叛乱活动的美国飞行员波普处以死刑。
    军事检察官指出，波普参加了反对印度尼西亚合法政府的武装叛乱。他在1958年4月和5月对印度尼西亚国土所进行的轰炸，造成了生命和财产的重大损失。波普披着“反共”的外衣有意识地参加叛乱。
    他指出，波普的罪行证实了有外国人帮助和干预印度尼西亚的叛乱。他追述了印度尼西亚总理在1958年发表的谈话，谈话中说到美国飞行员用从台湾起飞的飞机袭击印度尼西亚，给叛乱分子的飞机和自动武器也是从台湾运来的。他指出，印度尼西亚政府曾经要求美国对印度尼西亚问题采取不干涉的态度。
    军事检察官指出，所有的证据证明。波普的罪行是确凿的和严重的。因此，波普应该受到最严厉的惩罚，作为对外国干涉的答复。
    军事法庭将在2月22日听取被告的律师所作的辩护。
    雅加达“人民日报”今天在社论中表示支持军事检察官的要求。社论说，“美国人有什么权利轰炸印度尼西亚？即使波普只轰炸过印度尼西亚一次，他也应该被处以死刑。”“青年报”以“合情合理的惩罚”为题发表社论说，再没有别的惩罚比检察官要求对波普的惩罚更为恰当的了。
