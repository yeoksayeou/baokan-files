Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd. TASS reported: The Soviet "Labor News" wrote on the 2nd, commenting on the recently concluded Second All-African People's Conference, that there is no doubt that this conference will greatly promote the anti-colonialist struggle of the African people.

The commentary said that the conference actually became an indictment meeting, exposing the shocking and despicable crimes of imperialism: the suppression of indigenous residents, large-scale massacres, the plunder of African natural wealth, and so on. Reporters and speakers in the discussion pointed out the enormous danger of neo-colonialism, which is a kind of colonial rule maintained by recruiting a small number of puppets locally or by economic enslavement. The article pointed out that in this regard, the position of the American ruling group was sharply criticized at the meeting.

The commentary wrote that this year, nearly two-thirds of Africa's 200 million people will become citizens of independent countries. Neither brutal suppression nor replacing old, rusty chains with somewhat gilded new chains can prevent the process of the colonial empire's collapse that has already begun.

The newspaper emphasized that imperialism has suffered serious wounds, but colonialism is not yet dead. Colonialists are using every means to divide the ranks of the other side, weaken them, and then turn to counter-attack. The newspaper pointed out that in order to achieve and maintain independence, Africans should constantly strengthen unity and increase vigilance.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 2nd. "Labor News" published an editorial today stating that the Second All-African People's Conference once again demonstrated the firm fighting will and solid unity of the African people against imperialism and neo-colonialism. It pointed out that a new historical era of national liberation has begun in Africa.

The editorial said that imperialists know that they can no longer use military suppression to stop the powerful national liberation movements of the colonial people as they did in the past, so they have adopted deceptive methods of promising "reforms" and implementing "autonomy" in an attempt to ease the people's liberation struggle.

The editorial said that at this All-African People's Conference, representatives of many countries condemned the United States for pursuing neo-colonialism, which is completely correct. The editorial said that the American imperialism, which is actively participating in the scramble for colonies, is infiltrating the African continent under the guise of providing "aid," first establishing economic domination there, and then using it as a shackle for political oppression.

The editorial said that the resolutions of this All-African People's Conference made a solemn judgment against the ferocious imperialism and neo-colonialism, and declared a more resolute struggle against it.

The resolutions made by this conference show that the powerful force that overthrew powerful colonialism in Asia has emerged on the African continent, and any cunning conspiracy of the colonialists is destined to fail there.

The editorial concluded by saying that the Korean people warmly support and support the African people who are breaking through the darkness and heading for the light.

Today's "Democratic Korea" newspaper published a commentary hailing the Tunis Conference as a historic event in the African people's struggle for independence and freedom. It said that this conference reflected the greater unity and awakening of the people of the African continent in the rapidly developing anti-colonialist struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 2nd. "People's Daily" published a commentary today warmly congratulating the successful conclusion of the Second All-African People's Conference, and wishing the African people's struggle greater victory, and the solidarity between Asian and African countries is becoming increasingly consolidated.

The commentary said that the All-African People's Conference is a new development in the struggle of all African people against colonialism, for independence, freedom, and adequate food and clothing.

The commentary reviewed the rapid development of the African people's liberation movement recently, saying that the African nations are more closely united than in the past. The African nations' struggle against imperialism is becoming increasingly resolute and fierce. Under these circumstances, the colonialists were forced to recognize the independence of Cameroon, Congo, Togo, Somaliland and other countries. However, they have not abandoned the means of suppression and deception against the African nations. British Prime Minister Macmillan's visit to Africa and the activities of the United States in Africa are manifestations of these means.

The commentary said that the All-African People's Conference has emphasized strengthening the unity and mutual assistance of the African nations, and expressed resolute opposition to colonialism and neo-colonialism disguised as "aid" and "cooperation."

The commentary said that the heroic and arduous struggle of the African people has received the active support of socialist countries and the people of Asian countries, the oppressed nations of the world, and all peace-loving people.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, February 3rd. The Mongolian "Truth Daily" published an article today congratulating the successful conclusion of the Second All-African People's Conference. The article said that this conference, which is of great significance in the history of the African people's struggle, will contribute to further consolidating the unity of the African people and enhancing the peace and friendship of the people of the world.

The article said that since the First All-African People's Conference was held in Accra, the entire Africa has achieved great victories on the road of completely getting rid of colonial rule. However, the African people should not place all their hopes on some promises of the colonialists. The colonialists are now unable to control the colonial countries by means of violence and massacres, so they pretend to give some countries the so-called "concession" of independence. In fact, this is a new conspiracy to continue to maintain their rule in these countries.

The article pointed out that the Mongolian people are convinced that the day will soon come when the fighting African people completely get rid of the shameful oppression of colonialism, all of Africa is independent, and the African people decide their own destiny. They fully believe that in the common and just struggle to liberate Africa from imperialist oppression, the African people will further unite as one and achieve new and brilliant victories with the enthusiastic support of the just humanity of the world and the powerful socialist camp.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, February 3rd. The Hungarian "People's Freedom Daily" published a commentary on the 3rd, saying that the Second All-African People's Conference is another important stage in the African people's struggle for independence. The resolutions of the conference will once again inspire the great struggle currently being waged to achieve the independence of all of Africa.

The commentary said that since the First All-African People's Conference, the number of independent African countries has increased from eight to ten. In addition, the liberation movements of other African countries striving for national independence have also entered a high stage, forcing the colonialists to recognize the political independence of these countries. The commentary emphasized that Africa has stepped onto the stage of international life, which no force can stop.

The commentary pointed out that imperialism is trying to maintain its control over Africa and doing everything possible to undermine the unity of the African people. This conference pointed out that the main task of the African independence struggle is "freedom and unity." Because at the current stage, the unity of African countries is the main condition for winning and defending their freedom, and this unity is national unity against imperialism. Only through the unity of representatives of all strata of the African people can true independence be achieved.

The commentary also pointed out that the resolution of this conference on the struggle for African economic independence is of great significance. Because imperialism is only prepared to nominally agree to "independence," but at the same time still maintains its economic control over Africa.

The commentary concluded by saying that the African people are full of confidence in the struggle against imperialism, because they can count on the fraternal assistance and support of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp. Czechoslovak "Labor Daily"

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 3rd. "Labor Daily" published an article on the 2nd, congratulating the successful conclusion of the Second All-African People's Conference. The article said that this conference shows that African countries are combining their interests and becoming a powerful pan-African movement striving for political and economic independence.

The article pointed out that colonialists, especially American colonialists, are trying to find new forms to maintain their rule. They are trying to expand their economic position, establish military bases, and create new conspiracies that hinder the independence movement. However, African countries are no longer fooled.

The article pointed out that since the Accra Conference of the All-African People's Conference, Africa has been advancing rapidly. Last year, Africa gained new experience in the struggle to win and consolidate independence and in building new and liberated African countries.

The newspaper concluded by saying that the meeting showed that Africa is not only fighting, but also laying the foundation for a new life. The African people hope to live in freedom, peace and friendship.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, February 3rd. "Free Romania Daily" published an article today pointing out that the Second All-African People's Conference, which closed on January 31, is a new and important milestone in the African people's struggle to liberate Africa from colonial rule.

The article said that the central idea that ran through all the participants of this conference was that the struggle against colonialism must be strengthened. The document adopted at the conference is a concrete struggle program for the complete liberation of Africa from colonial enslavement.

After narrating the achievements of the Second All-African People's Conference and the hostile attitude adopted by certain Western groups towards the conference, the article said that the colonialist groups' propaganda campaign will not succeed. The life of colonialism is over, and the Second All-African People's Conference has once again confirmed this.

    社会主义国家报纸热烈祝贺全非人民大会胜利闭幕
    战斗的非洲人民将从胜利走向胜利
    镀金的新锁链也不能防止殖民帝国走向崩溃
    苏联“劳动报”
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联“劳动报”2日在评论刚刚闭幕的第二届全非人民大会时写道，毫无疑问，这次大会必将大大地推动非洲人民的反殖民主义的斗争。
    评论说，这次大会实际上变成了一个控诉会，会上揭发出了帝国主义的骇人听闻的卑鄙罪行：对土著居民的镇压、大规模的屠杀、对非洲天然财富的掠夺等等。报告人和在讨论中发言的人都指出了新殖民主义的巨大危险性，新殖民主义是这样一种殖民统治：靠在当地召募一小撮傀儡或者靠经济奴役来维持殖民统治。文章指出，在这方面，美国统治集团的立场在这次会议上受到了尖锐的抨击。
    评论写道，今年，非洲二亿人口中几乎有三分之二将成为独立国家的公民。无论是粗暴的镇压，还是把因天长日久而生锈的老锁链换成多少镀点金的新锁链，都不能防止已经开始了的殖民帝国崩溃的过程。
    这家报纸强调说，帝国主义遭受了严重的创伤，但是，殖民主义还没有死亡。殖民主义者正在使用一切手法竭力分裂对方的队伍，削弱对方，然后转为反攻。报纸指出，为了取得和保持独立，非洲人应当经常加强团结和提高警惕。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”
    新华社平壤2日电　“劳动新闻”今天发表社论说，第二届全非人民大会再次显示了非洲人民反对帝国主义和新殖民主义的坚决斗争意志和牢固团结。它指出，民族解放的新的历史时代已经在非洲开始。
    社论说，帝国主义者知道他们已经不能再像过去那样用武力镇压来制止殖民地人民的强大的民族解放运动，因而采取了允诺进行“改革”和实行“自治”的欺骗手法，企图借以缓和人民的解放斗争。
    社论说，在这届全非人民大会上，许多国家的代表谴责美国推行新的殖民主义，这是完全正确的。社论说，积极参加殖民地争夺战的美帝国主义正在提供“援助”的掩饰下渗入非洲大陆，首先在那里建立经济统治，然后利用它作为进行政治压迫的枷锁。
    社论说，本届全非人民大会的决议对凶恶的帝国主义和新殖民主义作出了严正的判决，并且宣布同它进行更加坚决的斗争。
    本届大会作出的各项决议表明，曾经在亚洲推翻强大的殖民主义的那种强大的力量已经在非洲大陆出现，殖民主义者的任何狡猾阴谋都注定要在那里遭到失败。
    社论最后说，朝鲜人民热烈支持和声援突破黑暗而奔向光明的非洲人民。
    “民主朝鲜报”今天发表的评论欢呼突尼斯会议是非洲人民在争取独立和自由的斗争中的历史性事件。它说，这次会议反映了非洲大陆人民在迅速发展的反殖民主义斗争中的更加团结和觉醒。
    越南“人民报”
    新华社河内2日电　“人民报”今天发表评论热烈祝贺第二届全非人民大会胜利闭幕，并祝非洲人民的斗争取得更大的胜利，亚非各国之间的团结日益巩固。
    评论说，全非人民大会是非洲全体人民反对殖民主义、争取独立自由和温饱的斗争的新进展。
    评论回顾最近非洲人民解放运动迅速的发展时说，非洲各民族比过去更加紧密地团结起来了。非洲各民族反对帝国主义的斗争越来越坚决和激烈。在这种情况下，殖民者被迫承认喀麦隆、刚果、多哥、索马里兰等国的独立。但是，它们并没有放弃对非洲各民族的镇压和欺骗的手段。英国首相麦克米伦正在非洲进行的访问和美国在非洲的活动都是这些手段的表现。
    评论说，全非人民大会已经强调加强非洲各民族的团结和互助，并表示坚决反对殖民主义和以“援助”、“合作”形式来伪装的新殖民主义。
    评论说，非洲人民的英勇和艰苦的斗争，得到了社会主义各国和亚洲各国人民、世界上被压迫的民族和一切爱好和平的人民的积极支持。
    蒙古“真理报”
    新华社乌兰巴托3日电　蒙古“真理报”今天发表文章，祝贺第二届全非人民大会的胜利闭幕。文章说，在非洲人民的斗争史上具有重要意义的这次会议，将对进一步巩固非洲人民的团结和增进全世界人民的和平和友谊作出贡献。
    文章说，自从在阿克拉召开第一届全非人民大会以来，整个非洲在彻底摆脱殖民统治的斗争道路上已经取得了巨大的胜利。但是，非洲人民不应该把全部希望寄托在殖民主义者的一些诺言上。殖民主义者现在已经无法用暴力和屠杀手段来控制殖民地国家了，因此，他们就装出了给予某些国家以独立这种所谓“让步”的姿态。实际上，这是继续保留他们在这些国家的统治地位的一个新阴谋。
    文章指出，蒙古人民确信，战斗中的非洲人民彻底摆脱殖民主义的可耻压迫、全非洲独立、非洲人民自己决定自己命运的那一天，不久就要到来。他们完全相信，在从帝国主义压迫下解放非洲的共同正义斗争中，非洲人民必将进一步团结一致，并在全世界正义人类和强大的社会主义阵营的热情支持下取得新的、光辉的胜利。
    匈牙利“人民自由报”
    新华社布达佩斯3日电　匈牙利“人民自由报”3日发表评论说，第二届全非人民大会是非洲人民争取独立斗争的又一个重要阶段。大会的决议将再一次鼓舞当前为争取全非洲独立而进行的伟大斗争。
    评论说，自从第一届全非人民大会以来，独立的非洲国家已由八个增加到十个。此外，其他非洲国家的争取民族独立的解放运动也进入了高涨阶段，迫使殖民主义者承认这些国家的政治独立。评论强调说，非洲已经走上了国际生活的舞台，这是任何力量都阻挡不了的。
    评论指出，帝国主义力图保持其对非洲的控制，千方百计地破坏非洲人民的团结。而这次大会指出，非洲独立斗争的主要任务是“自由和团结”。因为在目前阶段，非洲各国的团结是争取和保卫它们自由的主要条件，这个团结就是反对帝国主义的民族团结。只有通过非洲各国人民各阶层代表的团结一致，才能取得真正的独立。
    评论又指出，这次大会关于争取非洲经济独立斗争的决议，具有重大的意义。因为帝国主义只是准备名义上同意“独立”，但同时却还保持它们对非洲的经济控制。
    评论最后说，非洲人民在反对帝国主义的斗争中充满了信心，因为他们可以指望得到苏联和整个社会主义阵营的兄弟般的援助和支持。捷克斯洛伐克“劳动报”
    新华社布拉格3日电　“劳动报”2日发表文章，祝贺第二届全非人民大会胜利闭幕。文章说，这次会议表明，非洲各国正在把它们的利益结合起来，成为一个强大的争取政治和经济独立的全非运动。
    文章指出，殖民主义者，特别是美国殖民主义者企图寻找新的形式来保持它们的统治。它们竭力扩大自己的经济地位，建立军事基地，制造阻碍独立运动的新阴谋。但是，非洲国家不再上当了。
    文章指出，自从全非人民大会阿克拉会议以来，非洲在迅速地前进。去年，非洲在争取和巩固独立的斗争中，在建设解放了的新的非洲国家方面取得了新的经验。
    报纸最后说，会议表明，非洲不仅在战斗，并且正在奠立新生活的基础，非洲人民希望生活在自由、和平和友谊之中。
    “自由罗马尼亚报”
    新华社布加勒斯特3日电“自由罗马尼亚报”今天发表文章指出，1月31日闭幕的第二届全非人民大会，是非洲人民争取使非洲从殖民主义统治下解放出来的斗争中的一个新的和重要的里程碑。
    文章说，贯穿这次会议的所有参加者的中心思想是，必须加强反对殖民主义的斗争。会议通过的文件是从殖民主义奴役下彻底解放非洲的一个具体的斗争纲领。
    文章在叙述了第二届全非人民大会的成就和西方某些集团对会议所采取的敌视态度后说，殖民主义集团的宣传运动是不会成功的。殖民主义的生命已经完蛋了，第二届全非人民大会又一次证实了这一点。
