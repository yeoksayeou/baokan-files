Bulgaria's pig farming industry has developed rapidly amidst the movement to accelerate economic development. According to preliminary statistics, the number of pigs raised nationally last year increased by more than 20% compared to 1958, and this year it will increase by more than 30% compared to last year.

It is estimated that by 1965, the national average will be almost one pig per person. By the end of last year, Bulgaria's pig population was more than three times that of the pre-liberation year of 1939, reaching more than 2.26 million. The national plan for this year is to raise three million pigs.

In recent years, members of Bulgarian agricultural cooperatives have actively adopted specific measures such as raising more sows, producing more piglets, and improving breeding methods to vigorously develop the pig farming industry. Last year, agricultural cooperatives across the country raised 160,000 sows, an increase of more than 40,000 compared to 1958. The reproductive capacity of sows has been continuously improved. Sows raised by agricultural cooperatives across the country have increased from an average of 967 piglets per 100 sows per year in 1952 to 1,462 piglets per 100 sows per year in 1958.

In order to solve the problem of pig supply, in addition to cultivating basic sows, all regions also retain the born female piglets, which are mated when they reach adulthood to reproduce a generation, and then castrated for fattening.

Due to the adoption of methods such as automated feeding, the work efficiency of breeders has been greatly improved. Last year, the average number of pigs fed by each breeder in agricultural cooperatives across the country increased from 50 to 80 in 1957 to more than 200. Thanks to the improved feeding methods, a breeder in the Bairuoshen Village Agricultural Cooperative in Plovdiv Province can manage 800 pigs.

In developing its pig farming industry, Bulgaria has adopted a combination of public breeding by agricultural cooperatives and private breeding by members. In the past two years, the enthusiasm of agricultural cooperatives for pig breeding has increased, and the results have been the greatest. In 1958, agricultural cooperatives across the country raised about 860,000 pigs, while last year it surged to 1.6 million. This year, agricultural cooperatives across the country will raise 2.15 million pigs, accounting for more than 70% of the total number of pigs raised nationally.

With the development of the pig farming industry, pork production has been continuously increasing. Last year, the country produced a total of 200,400 tons of pork; it is estimated that the country will produce 310,000 tons of pork this year.

After the merger of small agricultural cooperatives into large cooperatives at the end of 1958 and the beginning of 1959, the large cooperatives also demonstrated their superiority in developing the pig farming industry. They expanded the original pig farms, built many new pig farms, tapped potential, and accelerated the pace of development.

    多养母猪　多产仔猪　改进饲养方法
    保加利亚迅速发展养猪业
    今年养猪头数将比去年增加30％以上
    在保加利亚加速经济发展的运动中，养猪业得到了迅速的发展。据初步统计，去年，全国饲养的猪比1958年增加了20％以上，今年又将比去年增加30％多。
    预计，到1965年，全国平均差不多每一个人就将有一头猪。到去年年底，保加利亚饲养的猪相当于解放前1939年的三倍多，达到了二百二十六万多头。今年全国计划养猪三百万头。
    近几年来，保加利亚农业合作社社员们积极采取多养母猪、多产仔猪、改进饲养方法等具体措施，来大力发展养猪业。去年，全国农业合作社养了十六万头母猪，比1958年增加了四万多头。母猪的繁殖能力不断提高，全国农业社养的母猪，已由1952年的平均每一百头年产九百六十七头仔猪，增加到1958年年产一千四百六十二头仔猪。
    为了解决猪源问题，各地除培育基本母猪外，还把生下来的小母猪留起来，成龄后全配上种繁殖一代，然后再阉割育肥。
    由于采用喂养自动化等办法，饲养员的工作效率有了很大的提高。去年全国农业社平均每个饲养员喂的猪已由1957年的五十头到八十头，增加到二百头以上，普罗夫迪夫州白罗谢姆村农业社由于改进了饲养方法，一个饲养员就能管理八百头猪。
    保加利亚在发展养猪业中，采取了农业合作社公养和社员私养相结合的办法，近两年来，农业社养猪的积极性提高了，而且成绩最大。1958年全国农业社共养了约八十六万头猪，而去年却猛增到一百六十万头。今年，全国农业社养的猪将达二百一十五万头，占全国养猪总头数的70％以上。
    随着养猪业的发展，猪肉的产量不断增加，去年，全国共生产了二十万零四千吨猪肉；预计，今年全国生产的猪肉将达三十一万吨。
    在1958年底到1959年初农业合作社由小社并成大社后，大的合作社在发展养猪业方面也表现出了它的优越性，它们扩大了原有的养猪场，修建了许多新的养猪场，挖掘了潜力，加快了发展速度。
