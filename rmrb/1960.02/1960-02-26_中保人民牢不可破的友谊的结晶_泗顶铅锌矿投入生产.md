Xinhua News Agency, Liuzhou, 24th - The Siding Lead-Zinc Mine in Guangxi, built with the assistance of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, officially went into production on the 20th.

　　A grand opening ceremony was held on that day. After Fu Yutian, Vice Chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Committee, cut the ribbon tied in front of the ore dressing workshop, the huge ball mill roared to life, and the entire series of production processes in the mine immediately began operating.

　　Panchevsky, Ambassador of the People's Republic of Bulgaria to China, and Barov, Commercial Counselor, were invited to attend the opening ceremony.

　　Also participating in the conference were Jiang Jinghe, Deputy Secretary-General of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Committee, Yang Jun, Deputy Director of the Autonomous Region Metallurgical Industry Bureau, Jin Gang, Deputy Director of the Foreign Liaison Department of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, Ma Fuyuan, Deputy Manager of the Technology Export Company of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, Liang Shan, Secretary of the CPC Liuzhou Prefectural Committee, Yang Wengui, Deputy Commissioner of the Liuzhou Prefecture, and Silakov, a Bulgarian expert participating in the construction of the Siding Lead-Zinc Mine.

　　Fu Yutian began the meeting by warmly welcoming Ambassador Panchevsky and Counselor Barov, who had traveled from afar to attend the opening ceremony. He said that the Siding Lead-Zinc Mine is one of the projects in which the Bulgarian Communist Party and the people are helping China's socialist economic construction. The People's Republic of Bulgaria not only helped China design and supply complete sets of machinery and equipment, but also sent outstanding experts. During their work in China, the experts worked diligently day and night with a lofty spirit of internationalism, helping the Siding Lead-Zinc Mine to be built and put into production in a relatively short period of time. Fu Yutian called on all mine workers to not only produce more and better products in the future, but also to regard spreading the friendship between China and Bulgaria as a regular task of their own. Finally, on behalf of the CPC Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee and the Autonomous Region People's Committee, he asked Ambassador Panchevsky to convey the heartfelt gratitude of the Chinese people to the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Bulgarian people.

　　Ambassador Panchevsky spoke amidst warm applause. The Ambassador said that although the distance between our two countries is far, with countless mountains, rivers, deserts and oceans in between, they will not hinder the comprehensive and fraternal cooperation between us. The completion and commissioning of the Siding Lead-Zinc Mine is the crystallization of the indestructible friendship between the Bulgarian and Chinese people.
