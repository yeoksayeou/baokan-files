Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 23rd: (Reporter Guo Shenrong) The wave of technological innovation and technological revolution on the industrial and transportation fronts of Hubei Province has spread to all walks of life. Batches of enterprises and entire cities are changing their original appearances every day.

The reform movement of loading and unloading tools in the province's industrial and transportation departments took the lead in blossoming with innovation. Some units discarded carrying poles and ropes, which had been used for thousands of years, and eliminated shoulder-carrying and back-toting within a few days. Now, the loading and unloading work at 130 wharves across the province has basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization.

Other industries and various types of factories and enterprises are also vigorously carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution, focusing on their own key production areas and characteristics. After several days of hard work and ingenuity, workers at the Hubei Tractor Factory established ten production lines, increasing the daily output of eight-horsepower diesel engines by more than double. Wuhan Iron and Steel Company No. 5 has equipped thirteen "dragons" in earthwork tools alone, enabling mechanization and semi-mechanization of digging, transporting, filling, leveling, and tamping processes, greatly improving work efficiency. According to the quota, each person had to complete 0.6 to 3.5 cubic meters of earthwork per day, but now they have generally reached 15 to 20 cubic meters, and the highest has exceeded 39 cubic meters. Bamboo weavers and shoemakers, who have relied on manual labor for thousands of years, have also begun to use machines to replace bamboo knives and scissors. Even in the catering industry, many units have developed rice washing machines, dough mixing machines, vegetable cutting machines, meat grinders, dishwashers, etc. With these tools, cooks can complete in a few minutes what used to take tens of minutes or even hours.

Since December of last year, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has vigorously promoted the "key breakthrough campaign" experience of Daye Steel Plant, as well as the technical performance competition experience created by Anshan Iron and Steel workers, which has shown a huge role in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement. According to the statistics of Jingzhou Prefecture alone, after more than a month of "key breakthrough campaigns," more than 1,400 of the original 1,600 heavy manual labor processes have been mechanized or semi-mechanized.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 22nd: "Overnight spring breeze, ten thousand flowers bloom," people use this sentence to summarize the excellent situation of the current innovation movement in Shenyang City, which is centered on realizing "four modernizations."

Since the beginning of this year, Shenyang City launched the march towards mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, the movement has progressed extremely rapidly. According to statistics from 124 mechanical and electrical, metallurgical, and construction enterprises alone, more than 240,000 technical innovation projects have been proposed around the "four modernizations" in just over a month, and more than 94,000 have been realized, equivalent to 80% of the total number of technical innovation projects last year, equal to 1.3 times that of 1958. The city's degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization has increased by more than 10%, from about 45.7% at the end of last year to about 56% now. At the same time, 151 automatic and linked production lines and 786 automated single-machine equipment have appeared in the city.

As soon as the municipal party committee issued the call for "four modernizations," hundreds of thousands of workers in the city immediately took action. Old and new workers, cadres, and technicians, as well as research institutions and universities, have all joined the movement and quickly formed a climax. After 17 days of hard work, the workers of the Fifth Workshop of Liming Machinery Factory realized the automatic thread hammer line, reducing from eight machine tools and eight workers to five beds and two workers, and the output increased by 47 times. The electric frozen soil cutting machine created by carpenter Zhang Xianwu of the Third Construction Engineering Company of Shenyang City can cut 24 cubic meters of frozen soil every day, and one machine can top the labor of 40 workers.

Various units in Shenyang have widely launched three-way combination and large-scale collaboration. Heping District of Shenyang City, where light industry and chemical industry units account for the vast majority, has established a technological transformation cooperation network, which concentrates its efforts at any time to help factories with weak technical, equipment, and material strength to overcome difficulties, thereby rapidly improving the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization of 104 factories in the district by 9.18% in just over a month.

    革新风暴横扫千年手工劳动
    湖北、沈阳许多企业、工序迅速实现机械化半机械化
    据新华社武汉23日电  记者郭慎容报道：湖北省工业、交通战线技术革新、技术革命的浪潮已经遍及各行各业，成批的企业、整座的城市每天都在改变着原来的面貌。
    全省工业、交通部门搬运装卸工具的改革运动，首开革新花朵。有的单位在几天之内就丢掉了沿用千百年的扁担、绳子，消灭了肩挑背驮。现在，全省有一百三十个码头的搬运装卸工作已经基本上实现了机械化半机械化。
    其他各行各业和各种类型的工厂企业，也都针对自己的生产关键和特点，大力开展技术革新和技术革命。湖北拖拉机厂职工经过几天苦干巧干，建立起十条生产流水线，使八匹马力柴油机的日产量提高一倍以上。武钢五公司仅在土方工具方面就配成了十三条“龙”，使挖、运、填、平、夯等工序实现了机械化半机械化，工效大大提高。按定额每人每天要完成土方零点六到三点五立方米，而现在他们已普遍达到十五到二十立方米，最高已突破三十九立方米。千百年来靠手工劳动的竹篾器工人、制鞋工人等，也开始用机械来代替篾刀和刀剪。即使在饮食行业中，目前也有不少单位制成了洗米机、合面机、切菜机、绞肉机、洗碗机等，炊事人员们用这些工具，在几分钟内就做完了过去要几十分钟甚至几小时才能做完的事。
    中共湖北省委从去年12月份起大力推广的大冶钢厂“攻关战役”经验，以及各企业普遍推广的鞍钢职工创造的技术表演赛经验，在技术革新、技术革命运动中显示了巨大的作用。仅据荆州专区的统计，经过一个多月的“攻关战役”，原来一千六百多个属于笨重体力劳动的工序，就有一千四百多个实现了机械化或半机械化。
    据新华社沈阳22日电　“一夜春风，万花齐放”，人们用这句话来概括沈阳市当前开展的以实现“四化”为中心的革新运动大好形势。
    沈阳市从今年年初展开向机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化进军以来，运动进展极为迅速。仅据一百二十四个机电、冶金、建筑企业的统计，在一个多月中围绕“四化”提出的技术革新项目就达二十四万多件，已实现的有九万四千多件，相当于去年技术革新项目总数的80％，等于1958年的一点三倍。全市机械化、半机械化程度约计增长了10％以上，现已从去年年末的45．7％提高到56％左右。与此同时，全市还出现了一百五十一条生产自动线、联动线，七百八十六台单机自动化设备。
    市委一提出“四化”号召，全市数十万职工就立即行动起来，新老工人、干部和技术人员，以及研究机关和大专学校，都纷纷投入了这一运动，而且迅速地形成高潮。黎明机械厂五一车间职工经过十七天苦战，实现了丝锤自动线，由过去八台机床、八名工人减少为五台床子、两名工人，产量提高了四十七倍。沈阳市第三建筑工程公司木工张宪武创造成功的电动割冻土机，每天可以割二十四立方米冻土，一台机器能顶四十名工人的劳动。
    沈阳各单位广泛展开了三结合、大协作。轻工化工单位占绝大多数的沈阳市和平区，建立起技术改造协作网，随时集中力量帮助技术、设备、材料力量较薄弱的工厂突破困难，从而在一个多月之内，使全区一百零四个工厂的机械化、半机械化水平迅速提高了9．18％。
