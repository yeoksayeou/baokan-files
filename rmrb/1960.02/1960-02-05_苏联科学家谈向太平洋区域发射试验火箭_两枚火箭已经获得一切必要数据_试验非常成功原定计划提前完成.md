    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd - TASS reports that the Soviet Union's tests of powerful multi-stage ballistic rockets launched into a predetermined area of the Pacific Ocean have been very successful, and therefore further testing can be stopped. This was stated to a TASS reporter by Stepanov, a veteran scientist and Doctor of Geography at the Institute of Ocean Hydrography of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
    Stepanov pointed out that the originally planned first series of launches was from January 15th to February 15th, but all necessary data had already been obtained after the second rocket flight.
    Stepanov said that the Soviet Union's multi-stage rocket tests will not only help launch heavy Earth satellites and engage in flights to planets in the solar system, but also deepen our understanding of the Earth and the planetary processes occurring within it. He pointed out that the development and changes in the Earth's natural conditions are directly related to the influence of the universe on it.
    Vinnikov, a professor at the Moscow Power Institute and a Lenin Prize winner, said in an interview published in the "Moscow Evening News" on the 2nd that the Soviet Union's test launches of two rockets in the Pacific region showed that mankind has already solved the problem of returning from outer space to the Earth. He said that this view is based on the fact that the Soviet rocket test ended ahead of schedule, the rocket passed through the dense atmosphere, and returned to the Pacific Ocean with extraordinary accuracy.
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd - The "Soviet Russia" newspaper published an article on the 3rd entitled "Rocket Hits the Target," commenting on the Soviet Union's brilliant achievement of launching two multi-stage ballistic rockets within a month.
    The article said that the successful launch of these two powerful multi-stage ballistic rockets marks a new stage in the development of Soviet rocket technology. It proves that Soviet scientists have precise equipment to control multi-stage ballistic rockets. Before these two rocket launches, no one had ever managed to return a space vehicle to the ground intact. This time, the final stage model of the Soviet-launched multi-stage rocket, equipped with special equipment, returned to the ground intact and landed at a predetermined location. This will undoubtedly promote the early realization of human spaceflight.
    The article also stated that automatic devices and television control are the basic methods for controlling powerful multi-stage ballistic rockets and making them accurately land at predetermined locations. Automatic devices are instrument equipment installed inside the rocket. It does not require human participation in the work, but if errors occur, it is difficult to correct them. Television control does not have this shortcoming, and if an error is found, it can be corrected immediately.

    苏联科学家谈向太平洋区域发射试验火箭
    两枚火箭已经获得一切必要数据
    试验非常成功原定计划提前完成
    新华社莫斯科3日电　据塔斯社报道，苏联向太平洋预定地区发射威力强大的多级弹道火箭的试验，进行得非常成功，因此可以停止进一步试验了。这是苏联科学院海洋水文学研究所老科学工作者、地理学博士斯捷潘诺夫对塔斯社记者说的。
    斯捷潘诺夫指出，原来预定的第一系列发射是从1月15日开始到2月15日为止，但是，在进行了第二次火箭飞行后就已经获得了一切必要的数据。
    斯捷潘诺夫说，苏联多级火箭的试验，不仅有助于发射重型地球卫星和从事到太阳系行星的飞行，而且还可以深入了解地球及其内部发生的行星过程。他指出，地球自然条件的发展和变化是同宇宙对它的影响有直接关联的。
    莫斯科动力学院教授、列宁奖金获得者维尼科夫2日在“莫斯科晚报”发表谈话说，苏联在太平洋区域进行的两支火箭的试验发射表明，人类解决从宇宙空间回到地面的问题，已经是现实的事了。他说，这种见解的根据就是，苏联火箭试验提前结束，火箭穿过了稠密大气层，并以极其非凡的准确程度回到了太平洋面上。
    新华社莫斯科3日电　“苏维埃俄罗斯报”3日发表了一篇题为“火箭正中目标”的文章，评论苏联在1月内发射两个多级弹道火箭的辉煌成就。
    文章说，这两个强大的多级弹道火箭的发射成功，标志着苏联火箭技术发展的新阶段。它证明苏联科学家已经拥有控制多级弹道火箭的精密设备。在这两个火箭发射之前，要使宇宙飞行体完整地返回地面，是任何人都没有做到的。而这次苏联发射的多级火箭的装有专门设备的最后一级模型，都完整地回到了地面，并且落到预定地点。这无疑地将促进人类实现宇宙飞行的日期早日到来。
    这篇文章还说，自动化装置和电视操纵，是控制强大的多级弹道火箭，使它准确地落到预定地点的基本方法。自动化装置是装在火箭内部的仪器设备。它不需要人来参加工作，但是如果出现误差，便很难纠正。而电视操纵就没有这个缺点，如果一旦发现误差，就可以立刻纠正。
