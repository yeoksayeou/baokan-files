(Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 16) A new high tide of vigorously developing pig raising is sweeping across Liaoning Province.

Since the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the call last December to vigorously develop pig raising, with communes running 10,000-pig farms, brigades running 1,000-pig farms, teams running 100-pig farms, and every household raising pigs, in the past month or so, various localities have broken the convention that farms cannot be built in winter, mobilized the masses to widely collect old bricks, tiles, and old wood, and promoted advanced experiences such as wooden pig houses and cave pig raising, setting off a new high tide of communes and brigades vigorously running pig farms. According to incomplete statistics from 22 counties under the jurisdiction of five cities including Anshan, more than 7,300 newly built pig farms at all levels have been built, with the number of pigs reaching 1,646,300.

In order to solve the problem of insufficient pig sources in the large-scale development of collective pig raising, various localities have focused on expanding the sow herds and improving the conception rate. In the past month, the number of newly retained reserve sows in the province has increased by 156,000. At the same time, various localities actively explore and expand feed sources, utilizing all agricultural and sideline products and wild plants. According to statistics from 40 counties and cities (suburbs) including Yingkou, Benxi, and Chaoyang, more than 500 million catties of various feeds have been collected. Faku County put forward the slogan "Thresh the threshing ground one more time, get more blighted grain and more food grain," and carried out a large-scale cleanup of the threshing ground, collecting more than 10 million catties of feed in ten days.

In the movement to vigorously develop collective pig farms, Party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership over pig production, improved leadership organizations, formulated development plans, and transferred cadres to strengthen the animal husbandry front.

(Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, February 16) In the rapid development of the pig raising industry in various parts of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the method of "every sow must be kept, keep first and then select" is adopted to rapidly breed sows. As of January 31, the number of sows in the region increased from 1,599,000 at the beginning of the year to 2,107,000, completing 84% of the annual sow development plan in just over a month.

The region's pig development plan for this year requires the total number of pigs to be doubled compared to last year. Therefore, since December of last year, all localities from top to bottom have generally attached importance to the breeding and mating of sows: establishing animal husbandry leadership organizations, training a large number of artificial insemination staff and epidemic prevention staff, and transferring a large number of cadres to work in pig farms. Due to the firm implementation of the "every sow must be kept, keep first and then select" method, Yulin Prefecture had developed 653,000 sows by the end of January, overfulfilling the annual sow retention plan, with 98.4% of adult sows being pregnant. In Wuzhou, Liuzhou, Baise and other prefectures, full-time pig raising management cadres at all levels have comprehensively strengthened the breeding, mating, and other work of sows by running "experimental farms," participating in production, and leading production.

While vigorously carrying out sow breeding and mating, various localities also emphasized that food and grass should come first, and adopted a combination of professional teams and large-scale mass movements to grow high-yield feed crops. As of early February, the entire autonomous region had planted more than 3.5 million mu of various feed crops. Yulin Prefecture made full use of scattered land, making use of every bit of space, and widely planted feed crops. At present, 720,000 mu of sweet potatoes, pumpkins, water hyacinths, gourds, and other crops have been planted. In Bobai County, Jiangning Commune mobilized 10,000 people and reclaimed more than 19,000 mu of wasteland and planted more than 460,000 holes of pumpkins in just three days.

(Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, February 16) In the new upsurge of raising pigs in a big way, communes in various parts of Shandong Province have launched a mass movement to prevent and control swine diseases, which has achieved great results in epidemic prevention work. Since last winter, the number of first-time vaccinations against swine diseases in the province accounted for 82.67% of the existing number of live pigs; the mortality rate of swine diseases has dropped from 0.93% in 1958 to 0.3%, and the occurrence of anthrax, emphysema, and swine erysipelas has been basically controlled. At present, 55 counties and cities, including Cangshan, have achieved a leap forward in pig raising without epidemics.

The main experience of Shandong Province in epidemic prevention work is to implement the method of four grasps (grasping ideology, planning, organizational leadership, evaluation and inspection), three unifications (unified arrangement, action, inspection), and five combinations (combining emergency epidemic prevention with good routine feeding management and environmental sanitation, combining professional technical forces with mass movements, combining veterinary medicine with traditional Chinese and Western medicine, combining local methods with foreign methods, and combining vaccination with comprehensive measures such as disinfection and isolation) to carry out large-scale operations and complete epidemic prevention tasks.

Secondly, in the epidemic prevention work, various localities have established and improved epidemic prevention organizations, making it possible for counties to have animal husbandry and veterinary hospitals, communes to have animal husbandry and veterinary stations, and teams and farms to have epidemic prevention staff, forming a relatively complete epidemic prevention network throughout the province. Since last year, the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Station of Chengtun People's Commune has implemented a combination of emergency and regular methods throughout the commune, with every pig being vaccinated and comprehensively preventing epidemics, realizing an epidemic-free pig raising commune.

In the epidemic prevention work, the secretaries of the Party Committee took command and launched a large-scale mass movement in various localities. Animal husbandry production organizations were established from the province, prefecture, and county to the commune and team, and the secretaries of the Party committees at all levels took command and made unified arrangements for the epidemic prevention work. Communes and teams in Feicheng County launched an epidemic prevention competition, regularly inspected and evaluated, and commended advanced units and model figures, which greatly promoted the epidemic prevention work. Relevant departments also implemented close cooperation and mutual support, with very good results.

    抓饲料抓繁殖抓防疫　千方百计办好养猪场
    养猪更大高潮席卷辽宁广西
    山东基本控制猪丹毒等疫病，五十五个县市出现无疫病的大好形势
    本报沈阳16日电　一个大办特办养猪事业的新高潮正在席卷辽宁全省。
    自去年12月中共辽宁省委提出关于公社办万猪场、大队办千猪场、小队办百猪场、家家户户养猪的大办特办养猪事业的号召以后，最近一个多月来，各地纷纷打破了冬季不能建场的常规，发动群众广泛收集旧砖瓦和旧木材，推广无木猪舍和山洞养猪等先进经验，掀起了社社队队大办养猪场的新高潮。据鞍山等五个市所辖的二十二个县不完全统计，新建的各级养猪场有七千三百多处，养猪头数达到一百六十四万六千三百头。
    为了解决集体养猪大发展中的猪源不足问题，各地大抓扩大母猪群和提高满怀率。最近一个月来，全省新留的后备母猪增加了十五万六千头。同时，各地积极挖掘和扩大饲料来源，把所有的农副产品和野生植物都利用起来。据营口、本溪、朝阳等四十县、市（郊区）的统计，已收集各种饲料五亿多斤。法库县提出“多打一遍场，多出秕谷多出粮”的口号，开展场院大扫荡，十天中就集饲料一千多万斤。
    在大办特办集体养猪场的运动中，各级党委都加强了对生猪生产的领导，健全领导机构，制定发展规划，抽调干部增强畜牧战线。
    本报南宁16日电　广西僮族自治区各地迅速发展养猪业中，采取“逢母必留，先留后选”的办法，迅速繁殖母猪，截至元月31日止，全区母猪头数由年初的一百五十九万九千头增长到二百一十万零七千多头。一个多月就完成了全年发展母猪计划的84％。
    自治区今年发展生猪规划，要求猪的总数比去年有成倍的增长。因此，自去年12月份以来，各地从上到下，普遍重视母猪的繁殖、配种工作：建立畜牧领导机构，训练大批人工授精员、防疫员，抽调大批干部到养猪场工作。玉林专区由于坚决采取“逢母必留，先留后选”的办法，到元月底止，母猪已发展到六十五万三千多头，超额完成了全年母猪留种计划，成年母猪满怀达98．4％。梧州、柳州、百色等专区，各级养猪专职管理干部，通过办“试验场”，参加生产，领导生产，全面加强母猪的繁殖、配种等工作。
    在大搞母猪繁殖、配种的同时，各地还强调粮草先行，采取专业队和大搞群众运动相结合的办法，大种高产饲料。至2月初，全自治区已种各种饲料三百五十多万亩。玉林专区充分利用零散土地，见缝插针，广种饲料，目前已种薯类、南瓜、水浮莲、水胡芦等七十二万亩。博白县江宁公社万人出动，仅三天时间，就开垦一万九千多亩荒地，种上南瓜四十六万多穴。
    本报济南16日电　在大养特养其猪的新高潮中，山东省各地公社展开了防治猪疫病的群众运动，使防疫工作取得了很大的成绩。从去冬以来，全省预防注射猪疫的头次，占现有生猪存养量的82．67％；猪疫病的死亡率，由1958年0．93％下降到0．3％，已基本控制了炭疽、气肿疽、猪丹毒病的发生。现在，全省有苍山等五十五个县市，实现了养猪无疫的跃进形势。
    山东省防疫工作的主要经验，是通过四抓（抓思想、计划、组织领导、评比检查），三统（统一安排、行动、检查），五结合（突击防疫与搞好平时饲养管理、环境卫生相结合，专业技术力量与群众运动相结合，兽医与中西医相结合，土法与洋法相结合，预防注射与消毒、隔离等综合措施相结合）的办法，实行大兵团作战，突击完成防疫任务。
    其次，在防疫工作中，各地都建立和健全了防疫组织，作到了县有畜牧兽医院，社社都有畜牧兽医站，队队、场场有防疫员，在全省范围内形成了一个比较完整的防疫网。程屯人民公社畜牧兽医站，从去年以来，全社实行了突击和经常相结合的方法，头头注射，全面防疫，实现生猪无疫社。
    在防疫工作中，各地都是书记挂帅，大搞群众运动。从省、地、县到社、队都建立了畜牧生产组织，由各级党委书记挂帅，对防疫工作进行了统一安排布置。肥城县的社社、队队开展了防疫竞赛运动，经常检查评比，表扬先进单位和模范人物，大大推动了防疫工作。各有关部门还实行了密切协作，互相支援，效果很好。
