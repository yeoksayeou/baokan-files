    Under the thousand-year frozen snow mountain,
    Grow beautiful flowers;
    The five-star red flag flutters on the snowy mountain peak,
    Making those flowers bloom even more brightly.
    In the thousand-year dark tribe,
    Shackled are the pitiful shepherds;
    The Communist Party secretary comes among the masses,
    And the shepherds sing songs of joy.
    On the thousand-year vast grasslands,
    Nourishing countless cattle and sheep;
    The People's Commune is established in the center of the grasslands,
    Making those cattle and sheep grow even fatter.

    千年封冻的雪山下
    千年封冻的雪山下，
    生长着美丽的花朵；
    五星红旗在雪山顶上飘扬，
    那花朵开得更加鲜艳。
    千年黑暗的部落里，
    枷锁着可怜的牧羊人；
    共产党书记来到群众中，
    牧人唱出了欢乐的歌声。
    千年茫茫的草原上，
    哺育着无数的牛羊；
    人民公社建立在草原中央，
    那牛羊长得更加肥壮。
