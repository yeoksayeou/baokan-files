Success Comes from Not Fearing Failure
Chen Fangyao, Secretary of the CCP Anshan Iron and Steel Cast Pipe Plant Committee

    After a year and a half of research, experimentation, and trial production, the workers of our Anshan Iron and Steel Cast Pipe Plant have overcome various difficulties and successfully created the continuous casting method for pipes. This method involves pouring molten iron from top to bottom on a self-made casting machine, and the pipe is automatically cast. Continuous pouring of molten iron results in continuous pipe production. The machine also has specialized equipment to adjust the size and length of the pipes at will. This eliminates the eight processes of molding and core making required by the original sand casting method, and changes the 60% manual operation in the production process, realizing production mechanization and automation.

    The Anshan Iron and Steel Cast Pipe Plant is an old factory with a twenty-five-year history. After liberation, in order to increase the output of cast pipes and improve the working conditions of the workers, we adopted many technical measures and labor protection measures, which increased the output by seventeen times and also improved the working conditions to a certain extent. However, the heavy manual labor and dusty working environment were never completely changed. In order to solve the problem fundamentally, we once researched and experimented with the continuous casting method in 1953. At that time, due to the incomplete liberation of the leadership's thinking and the failure to fully mobilize the masses, it failed. In June 1958, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, all the workers in our plant established a communist style of daring to think and dare to act, and determined to conduct continuous casting experiments again. This time, due to the implementation of putting politics in command, and after 381 experiments, we finally succeeded in creating this advanced pipe casting method.

    The successful process of continuous casting vividly illustrates that the working masses armed with the Party's General Line have tremendous creative power. Only by earnestly adhering to the Party's mass line working methods, and only by relying on the broad masses of workers, can we truly run socialist enterprises well, and can the technical level of enterprises be rapidly improved.

    Revolution Requires Revolutionary Courage

    At present, the continuous casting method is the most advanced technology in the world. When we started the experiment, we only had a picture of a continuous casting machine. At that time, our decision to experiment was not a reckless adventure, but mainly based on the following three favorable conditions.

    First, all the workers in the plant had a strong desire for a great leap forward. After 1958, although all the workers in the plant used old equipment left over from the puppet Manchurian regime to produce seventeen times more cast pipes than in 1949, it still could not meet the needs of national construction. At that time, all the workers in the plant were truly eager to try and ready to do a great job. As long as the leadership could point out the direction, even the greatest difficulties could be overcome. This soaring enthusiasm of the masses gave the leadership more confidence and determination.

    Second, many veteran workers had rich experience. Our factory is an old factory, and more than 30% of the workers have more than ten years of service. In their daily production practice, they have accumulated rich experience in pipe casting. The practical experience of the workers is the best data that cannot be found in pipe casting technical books. This valuable practical experience is our solid capital for experimenting with continuous casting.

    Third, China had already successfully experimented with continuous ingot casting. Continuous ingot casting is currently the most advanced technology in the world, and it has been successfully tested by fraternal factories and has been applied in the production of many factories. Although continuous ingot casting and continuous pipe casting are two different production technologies, as the saying goes, "Different trades, same principles." At that time, we considered that if others could successfully experiment with continuous ingot casting, why couldn't we successfully experiment with continuous pipe casting?

    At that time, after considering these favorable conditions, we resolutely decided to experiment with continuous casting. Now, looking back at our continuous casting experiments, if there is any experience, the first is to dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do.

    We have learned from the continuous casting experiments that revolution requires revolutionary courage. Without revolutionary courage, there can be no revolution; but revolutionary courage will never arise out of thin air. It is the result of combining revolutionary enthusiasm with scientific analysis.

    Mobilize Workers and Technical Personnel

    Having revolutionary courage and determination to carry out the revolution is only the beginning. If you want to make the revolution successful, there is also a question of method. The reason why our continuous casting experiments were successful is because we implemented the Party's mass line.

    As early as 1953, we experimented with continuous casting once, but it failed. The main reason for the failure was that we still had some superstitious ideas at that time and did not follow the mass line. At that time, our approach was to only entrust a small number of technical personnel to experiment, and if the experiment was not successful, we abandoned it halfway.

    This time, we learned from the first lesson and mobilized all the workers in the plant to contribute to the experiment. From the initial design and creation of the continuous casting machine to the final continuous casting of the pipes, it was all carried out mainly by workers, especially veteran workers. The workers used their rich experience to solve many key problems, and they used their strong will to overcome numerous difficulties and solve the problem of pipes breaking easily.

    In the process of experimenting with continuous casting, the technical personnel also made great contributions. They helped the workers revise and supplement the design of the continuous casting machine, and they theoretically analyzed the reasons for each failure, inspiring the workers to use their practical experience to solve the key problems encountered. In order to give full play to the expertise of the technical personnel, we organized "three-way combination" experimental groups from the beginning, mobilizing leading cadres, workers and technical personnel to combine with each other, inspire each other, study together, learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, which greatly promoted the early success of the continuous casting experiment.

    In the continuous casting experiments, we also realized that we must follow the mass line, rely on the workers, but should not ignore the role of technical personnel at all. Moreover, only by mobilizing technical personnel, giving full play to their technical and theoretical knowledge, inspiring and helping the workers, can we better give play to the role of the working masses.

    Strengthen Party Leadership and Carry Out Ideological Struggle

    In this experiment, we failed more than three hundred times. Through countless failures, we deeply realized that this is not only a process of overcoming difficulties, but also a process of continuous ideological struggle. What is terrible is not failure but discouragement. Only by persevering and not being discouraged can we succeed.

    To achieve a technical innovation, especially research and experimentation from scratch, it is almost inevitable to fail a few times or even hundreds of times. When we had been experimenting for more than two hundred times and still cast only pipe heads instead of complete pipes, two completely different ideas emerged among the personnel participating in the experiment. Most of the veteran workers advocated sticking to it and vowed not to give up until they succeeded. From the many failures, they saw the factors of success. They believed that if they could cast pipe heads, they would not have to worry about casting pipes.

    Some others advocated calling it quits. All they saw was failure, and they believed that after more than two hundred experiments, all the methods had been exhausted, and there was no hope. After the Party committee discovered these two ideas, it further strengthened political and ideological work and resolutely supported the first idea.

    Of course, what we mean by not being afraid of failure is by no means passively waiting for success, but actively striving for success. Every failure should not be in vain. We must learn from the experience and lessons of each failure, analyze and study a series of failures, find out the root causes of the failures, and thus master the laws of objective things and truly turn failure into the mother of success. We realized through this experiment that how to treat each failure is the dividing line between success and failure, and also the question of how to better rely on the masses and better implement the Party's mass line.

    The successful experiment of continuous casting is the result of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, the result of using the working methods of the mass line, the result of strengthening political and ideological work, and the great victory of the Party's General Line. In our future work, we will firmly remember the experience and lessons of experimenting with continuous casting, vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, and achieve a better and more comprehensive continued leap forward this year.

    不怕失败就能成功
    中共鞍钢铸管厂委员会书记　陈仿尧
    我们鞍钢铸管厂职工，经过一年半来的研究、试验和试生产，克服了种种困难，创造成功了连续铸管法。这种铸管法就是在自制的铸管机上，由上往下倒铁水，管子就自动地铸造出来，连续倒铁水就可以连续出管子。同时机器上还有专门的设备，管子的大小长短都能够随意调整。这样就减少了原来采用的砂型造管法所需要的造型、制芯等八道工序，改变了生产操作过程中的60％手工操作情况，实现了生产机械化和自动化。
    鞍钢铸管厂是一个有二十五年历史的老厂。解放后，我们为了增加铸管产量，改善工人的劳动条件，曾经采取了许多技术措施和劳动保护措施，使产量增加十七倍，也使劳动条件得到一定程度的改善。但是繁重的手工操作和烟尘飞扬的劳动环境，始终没有彻底改变。为了从根本上解决问题，我们在1953年一度研究和试验过连续铸管法。当时由于领导思想没有完全解放，没有充分发动群众，结果失败了。1953年6月，我们全厂职工在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，树立了敢想敢干的共产主义风格，决心再次进行连续铸管的试验。这一次由于实行了政治挂帅，前后试验了三百八十一次，终于创造成功了这一先进的铸管法。
    连续铸管试验成功的过程，生动地说明了：用党的总路线武装起来的职工群众，具有极伟大的创造力量，只有认真地坚持党的群众路线的工作方法，只有依靠广大职工群众，才能真正办好社会主义的企业，才能使企业的技术水平飞跃提高。
    有革命胆量才能革命
    在目前，连续铸管法是世界上最先进的技术。我们在着手试验时，手里只有一张连续铸管机的图片。当时我们所以敢于决定试验，也不是毫无根据的冒险，主要是考虑到如下三方面的有利条件。
    第一、是全厂职工都有大跃进的要求。1958年之后，尽管全厂职工用伪满遗留的旧设备，生产出比1949年多十七倍的铸管，但是仍然不能满足国家建设的需要。当时全厂职工，真个是人人磨拳擦掌，个个准备大干一场，只要领导能给指出方向来，天大的困难也能克服。群众的这种冲天干劲，给领导增加了信心和决心。
    第二、许多老工人有着丰富的经验。我们工厂是一个老厂，30％以上的工人有十年以上的工龄。他们在日常的生产实践中，积累了丰富的铸管经验。工人们的实践经验，是在铸管技术书籍上找不到的最好的资料，这些宝贵的实践经验，是我们试验连续铸管的雄厚资本。
    第三、是我国已经试验成功连续铸锭。连续铸锭法，是目前世界上最先进的技术，当时已经由兄弟工厂试验成功，并已经在许多工厂的生产上应用了。连续铸锭和连续铸管，虽然是两种不同的生产技术，但是，俗语说：“隔行不隔理”，当时我们考虑到，别人能试验成功连续铸锭，我们为什么不能试验成功连续铸管呢。
    当时，我们考虑到这些有利条件后，就毅然决定试验连续铸管法。现在回过头来想一想我们试验连续铸管的经过，如果说有经验的话，头一条就是敢想、敢说、敢做。
    我们通过连续铸管的试验体会到要革命就得有革命的胆量，没有革命的胆量就不能革命；但是革命的胆量也决不会凭空产生，是革命干劲和科学分析相结合的结果。
    发动工人也发动技术人员
    有革命的胆量，决心进行革命，这仅仅是个开始，要想把革命闹成功，这里还有一个方法问题。我们试验连续铸管所以能成功，是由于我们执行了党的群众路线。
    早在1953年，我们就试验过一次连续铸管，结果失败了。失败的主要原因是，当时还有点迷信思想，没有走群众路线。当时我们的做法是，只交给少数技术人员试验，试验没成功，就半途而废了。
    这次我们接受了头一次的教训，动员全厂职工为试验出力。从最初设计、创造连续铸管机，到最后连续铸出管子来，都是以工人、特别是老工人为主来进行的。工人群众用自己的丰富经验，解决了许多关键问题，他们用自己的坚强意志，战胜了重重困难，解决了管子容易断的难题。
    在试验连续铸管的过程中，技术人员们也做出了很大贡献。他们帮助工人修改补充连续铸管机的设计，他们从理论上分析每次失败的原因，启发工人运用实践经验解决碰到的关键问题。为了发挥技术人员的专长，一开始我们就组织了“三结合”的试验小组，发动领导干部、工人和技术人员相互结合，相互启发，共同研究，取长补短，大大促进了连续铸管试验的早日成功。
    在连续铸管的试验中，我们还体会到，必须走群众路线，依靠工人群众，但丝毫不应该忽略发挥技术人员的作用。而且，只有发动技术人员，发挥他们的技术理论知识，启发和帮助工人，才能更好地发挥工人群众的作用。
    加强党的领导开展思想斗争
    我们在这次试验中，曾经先后失败三百多次。通过无数次失败，我们深切地体会到，这不仅是一个战胜困难的过程，也是一个不断地进行思想斗争的过程。可怕的不是失败而是泄气，只有不气馁坚持下去才能成功。
    要实现一项技术革新，特别是从无到有的研究试验，失败个几次甚至几百次，几乎是不可避免的事情。当我们接连试验两百多次，铸出来的还是管子头、而不是成根管子的时候，在参加试验的人员当中，出现两种截然不同的思想。多数老工人主张坚持下去，不成功誓不罢休。他们从多次失败中，却看到了成功的因素，他们认为能铸出管子头来，就不愁铸不出管子来。
    另外一些人，主张收兵不干。他们看到的只是失败，认为试验了两百多次，办法已经想绝了，算是没有指望了。党委发现了这两种思想后，进一步加强了政治思想工作，坚决地支持了头一种思想。
    当然，我们说的不怕失败，也绝不是消极的等待成功，而是要积极的夺取成功。每一次失败，都不应该白失败，要从每一次失败中，找出失败的经验教训，分析研究一连串的失败，从中找出失败的根本原因，从而掌握客观事物的规律，真的把失败变为成功之母。我们通过这次试验认识到，如何对待每一次失败，是成功和失败的分界线，也是如何更好地依靠群众、更好地贯彻党的群众路线的问题。
    连续铸管的试验成功，是敢想、敢说、敢做，是运用群众路线的工作方法，是加强政治思想工作的结果，是党的总路线的伟大胜利。我们在今后的工作中，将牢牢记取试验连续铸管的经验教训，大张旗鼓地开展技术革新和技术革命，实现今年更好更全面的继续跃进。
