Xinhua News Agency, Rome, February 5th: The Ninth Congress of the Italian Communist Party concluded in Rome on the 4th after six days of meetings. During the six days, a total of fifty-three delegates spoke, engaging in extensive discussions on the report delivered by General Secretary Togliatti on behalf of the Central Committee to the congress.

At the meeting on the 4th, Togliatti delivered a concluding speech on the congress's discussion of the political report. He pointed out that the congress fully agreed with the party's political line as expounded in the report presented by the Central Committee. He said that the party's political line, which the congress supported, would become a solid foundation for the party's unity and discipline, and pointed out the basic direction of the party's political and organizational work.

Togliatti said that the Italian Communist Party intends to establish a new alliance of historical significance—that is, to make the working class the leading force of the entire society.

He emphasized that the aim of the Italian Communist Party is to unite the working class, the peasant masses, the middle strata in production, and progressive intellectuals, to establish a new democratic system in Italy, in which democracy will gain new content and will open a path for future progress.

Togliatti called on party members to go deeper into the lives of the working people and remember that studying the living conditions of the working people and putting forward demands for improving their situation, as well as studying and understanding the situation of intellectuals and students and caring about their specific demands, are an inseparable part of the party's work.

The evening meeting on the 4th heard and approved the reports of the Central Inspection Commission and the Credentials Committee of the Congress. The meeting adopted a decision on the report of the Political Committee of the Congress, deciding to entrust the Party Central Committee with finalizing and publishing it on the basis of the draft resolution proposed by the Political Committee. The Congress also decided to make certain amendments to the Party Constitution.

Then, the congress re-elected the party's leading organs. The newly elected Central Committee consists of one hundred and twenty-eight members, the Central Auditing Commission consists of sixty-two members, and the Central Inspection Commission consists of five members. Togliatti, Longo, Alicata, Amendola, Ingrao, and Novella were among those elected as members of the Central Committee.

The Political Committee of the Congress passed a resolution expressing full support for the Algerian people's struggle for independence and freedom. The Congress paid warm tribute to the French Communist Party—"the standard-bearer in the struggle for national independence, democracy, and socialism for the people under colonial oppression."

Xinhua News Agency, Rome, February 5th: The Central Committee and the Central Auditing Commission elected by the Ninth Congress of the Italian Communist Party held meetings after the conclusion of the congress. The meetings elected nineteen members of the Politburo and six members of the Secretariat.

Palmiro Togliatti was re-elected as the General Secretary of the Party, and Luigi Longo was re-elected as the Deputy General Secretary of the Party.

The other members of the Secretariat are: Giorgio Amendola, Pietro Ingrao, Giancarlo Pajetta, Anelito Balantini.

Mauro Scoccimarro was re-elected as Chairman of the Central Auditing Commission, and Giuseppe Dosa and Girolama Li Causi are the Vice-Chairmen.
