Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch, Tokyo: Approximately ten thousand government employees held a mass rally in Tokyo today to oppose the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and demand the safeguarding of workers' livelihoods and democratic rights.

	Today's rally marks the beginning of a series of actions planned by 1.5 million Japanese government employees and serves as a prelude to the large-scale spring struggle of Japanese workers.

	After unanimously passing four resolutions, including one opposing the ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the assembly held a demonstration march through the city.

	In one resolution, the assembly demanded that government authorities increase the monthly salary of each civil servant by 3,000 yen. This resolution condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government for freezing the salaries of civil servants for the past six years, while on the other hand, increasing military spending in this year's draft budget to a post-war high (150 billion yen). The resolution also condemned the government for using the low wages of civil servants as an excuse to suppress the demands of workers in non-governmental sectors for wage increases.

	In another resolution concerning basic labor rights, the assembly demanded that the government immediately and unconditionally ratify International Labor Organization Conventions Nos. 87 and 105 concerning the protection of workers' rights. This resolution stated that government employees are determined to fight for the restoration of basic labor rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Japanese government employees are deprived of the right to strike, and some departments' personnel do not even have the right to negotiate with their superiors.

	According to the planned schedule, following today's rally in Tokyo, Japanese government employees will hold similar mass rallies and discussions throughout the country before the 20th. After February 25th, civil servants will also continue the struggle by taking leave from 30% to 50% of the workforce.

	Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch, Tokyo: Japanese Socialist Party member of parliament, Tadataka Sata, questioned Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi today in a plenary session of the House of Councillors regarding the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." He said that the U.S.'s Far East strategy is aimed at China and the Soviet Union, and Japan is the U.S.'s outpost, and the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" have an obligation to take military action in the event of war.

	Sata particularly pointed out that Japan could dispatch troops abroad and launch attacks under the pretext of "preemptive strikes."

	Socialist Party member of parliament, Hisao Kuroda, also posed sharp questions to Nobusuke Kishi at the plenary session of the House of Representatives yesterday, saying that the new "Security Treaty" is a military alliance that is dependent on the United States and makes Japan lose its independence. He pointed out that this treaty will be used for aggressive purposes, and therefore, Japan is in danger of being dragged into war.

	Kuroda also exposed the Kishi Nobusuke government's conspiracy to deceive people with the exchange of notes on "prior consultation" with Japan regarding the dispatch of U.S. troops stationed in Japan.

	Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch, Tokyo: The Japanese Socialist Party submitted a draft resolution to the House of Representatives today, demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke government abandon its plan to have the Diet approve the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and quickly negotiate a peace treaty with the Soviet Union.

	The Socialist Party's draft resolution pointed out that the Soviet Union issued a memorandum to Japan condemning the Kishi Nobusuke government for signing a military alliance treaty and announced that it would only transfer the Habomai Islands and Shikotan Island to Japan after foreign troops were withdrawn from Japan, which should be the direct responsibility of the Kishi Nobusuke government.

	The draft resolution pointed out that the new "Security Treaty" is a military alliance aimed at the Soviet Union. This treaty has exacerbated tensions in the Far East and poses a threat to the Soviet Union.

	Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch, Tokyo: The Japan-Soviet Association issued a statement today demanding that the Diet not ratify the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and quickly negotiate and conclude a peace treaty with the Soviet Union.

	The statement pointed out that the Japanese public is increasingly opposed to the new "Security Treaty" because the people know that the new "Security Treaty" is a military treaty aimed at China and the Soviet Union. The statement went on to say that more and more people are beginning to express that Japan should conclude a peace treaty with the Soviet Union as soon as possible in accordance with the joint declaration announcing the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union.

	The statement emphasized that the conclusion of a Japan-Soviet peace treaty is necessary to resolve issues related to economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries and safety measures for fishing in the northern seas. It will make a significant contribution to the cause of peace in the Far East and the world.

	In referring to the Soviet memorandum of January 27, the statement pointed out that the Soviet Union said that it could only transfer Habomai Island and Shikotan Island to Japan on the condition that foreign troops are withdrawn from Japan, which does not violate the Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration. The Japan-Soviet Association refuted the Kishi Nobusuke government's accusation that the Soviet memorandum was an interference in Japan's internal affairs. The Japan-Soviet Association said that the association believes that the Soviet memorandum is fully in accordance with international law.

	The statement concluded by saying that the Japanese government should formulate and implement new policy guidelines based on the principles of peaceful coexistence, complete disarmament, and neutrality.

	The Japan-Soviet Association decided to send representatives to demand that the Kishi Nobusuke government abandon its attempt to have the Diet approve the new "Security Treaty" and hold negotiations on the issue of the Japan-Soviet peace treaty.

	Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch, Tokyo: At a national committee meeting held on the 9th, the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade decided to call on all manufacturers to launch a petition movement to the government and the Diet, demanding that they adopt an independent and autonomous diplomatic policy that moves towards disarmament and peaceful coexistence, so as to promote the opening of the deadlock in Japan-China relations and the conclusion of a Japan-Soviet peace treaty.

	The meeting unanimously agreed that the conclusion of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" has made it more difficult to open the deadlock in Japan-China relations and hinders the development of economic exchanges between Japan and neighboring socialist countries. The meeting demanded that the government and the Diet respect the will of the Japanese people and properly handle the issue of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

	Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch, Tokyo: The unions affiliated with the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) held a meeting of youth department heads on the 8th and decided to organize youth action teams of five people each in various posts to carry out propaganda activities to arouse public opinion against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and to collect signatures to petition the Diet to prevent the Diet from approving the new "Security Treaty."

	According to the meeting's estimates, approximately 200,000 youth action teams will be formed nationwide. They will distribute one million leaflets in various places.

	The meeting also decided to use the youth action teams as the core to mobilize young people in various regions to actively participate in the large-scale marches to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and protect their lives and rights, and to convene a national congress of young workers in Tokyo on March 20, at the end of this large-scale march, to "Implement the Spring Struggle and Oppose the Ratification of the New Security Treaty" to discuss future struggle plans.

	Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch, Tokyo: Forty-six Japanese women's groups decided on the 9th to hold mass rallies across the country on April 16 to oppose the Diet's passage of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

	According to the Japan Women's Association for the Protection of National Human Rights, 10,000 women will participate in the mass rally in Tokyo on that day.

    坚决不许批准日美军事条约
    东京举行万人大示威
    社会党议员指出美国把日本当作反对中苏的前哨基地
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：共约一万名政府公务人员今天在东京举行群众大会，反对日美军事同盟条约，要求维护工人们的生活和民主权利。
    今天的大会是日本一百五十万政府公务人员计划展开的一系列行动的开端，也是日本工人的大规模春季斗争的先声。
    大会在一致通过了反对批准新日美“安全条约”等四项决议以后，在市内举行了示威游行。
    大会在一项决议中，要求政府当局把每个公务人员每月的工资增加三千日元。这项决议谴责岸信介政府在过去六年中一直冻结公务人员的工资；而另一方面，却在今年的预算草案中把军费增加到战后的最高纪录（一千五百亿日元）。决议还谴责政府以公务人员低工资为借口，来压制非政府部门工人增加工资的要求。
    大会在另一项关于基本劳工权利的决议中，要求政府立即无条件地批准国际劳工组织关于维护工人权利的第八十七号和第一百零五号公约。这项决议表示政府公务人员决心为恢复宪法保证的基本劳工权利而奋斗。日本的公务人员被剥夺了罢工的权利，有些部门的人员甚至没有同上级举行谈判的权利。
    根据预定计划，在东京今天举行的这个大会以后，日本公务人员们将在20日以前在全国各地举行类似的群众集会和讨论会。在2月25日以后，公务人员还将采取由30％到50％的职工请假的方式，继续进行斗争。
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本社会党议员佐多忠隆今天在国会参议院全体会议上就新日美“安全条约”向岸信介首相提出质询。他说，美国的远东战略是针对中、苏两国的，而日本是美国的前哨基地，日本“自卫队”在发生战争时就有采取军事行动的义务。
    佐多特别指出，日本会借口“先发制人”而派兵出国，发动进攻。
    社会党议员黑田寿男昨天在众议院全体会议上也向岸信介提出尖锐的质询说，新“安全条约”是依附美国的一个军事同盟，使日本失掉独立性。他指出，这个条约将被利用来达到侵略的目的，因此，日本有被卷入战争的危险。
    黑田还揭穿了岸信介政府因驻日美军出动要同日本“事先协商”的换文进行欺骗的阴谋。
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天向国会众议院提交了一项决议草案，要求岸信介政府放弃使国会批准新日美“安全条约”的计划，并且迅速同苏联谈判缔结和约。
    社会党的决议草案指出，苏联向日本提出备忘录谴责岸信介政府签订军事同盟条约，并且宣布要在日本的外国军队撤走以后才能把齿舞群岛和色丹岛移交日本，这应该由岸信介政府直接负责。
    决议草案指出，新“安全条约”是一个针对苏联的军事同盟。这个条约加剧了远东的紧张局势，对苏联造成了威胁。
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：日苏协会今天发表声明，要求国会不要批准新日美“安全条约”，并且迅速同苏联进行谈判，缔结和约。
    声明指出，日本公众日益反对新“安全条约”，因为人民知道，新“安全条约”是针对中国和苏联的军事条约。声明接着说，越来越多的人开始表示，日本应当根据宣布日苏两国恢复外交关系的联合宣言，早日同苏联缔结和约。
    声明强调说，缔结日苏和约对于解决有关两国经济和文化交流以及在北部海洋捕鱼的安全措施的问题是必要的。它将对远东和世界的和平事业作出重大的贡献。
    声明在谈到1月27日的苏联备忘录时指出，苏联说，只有在外国军队撤出日本的条件下，才能把齿舞岛和色丹岛移交日本，这并不违反日苏联合宣言。日苏协会驳斥了岸信介政府诬蔑苏联提出的备忘录是干涉日本内政的说法。日苏协会说，协会认为苏联的备忘录完全符合国际法。
    声明最后说，日本政府应当根据和平共处、彻底裁军和中立的原则制订新的政策方针，并且付诸实施。
    日苏协会决定派代表要求岸信介政府放弃使国会批准新“安全条约”的企图，并且就日苏和约问题举行谈判。
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：日本国际贸易促进协会在9日举行的全国委员会会议上决定，将呼吁全体厂商向政府和国会展开请愿运动，要求采取走向裁军与和平共处的独立自主的外交政策，以便促进打开日中关系僵局和缔结日苏和约。
    会议一致认为，新日美“安全条约”的缔结使打开日中关系僵局更加趋于困难，并阻挠日本同邻近社会主义各国的经济交流的发展。会议要求政府和国会尊重日本人民的意志，妥善处理新日美“安全条约”的问题。
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会所属工会在8日举行青年部长会议，决定在各岗位组织以五人为一组的青年行动队，展开宣传活动，以唤起反对新日美“安全条约”的舆论，同时征集签名向国会请愿，以阻止国会批准新的“安全条约”。
    据会议估计，在全国将成立约二十万组青年行动队。他们将到各地散发一百万张传单。
    会议同时决定，将以青年行动队为核心，动员各地区的青年积极参加阻止修改日美“安全条约”和保卫生活与权利的大游行，并且在这次大游行结束的3月20日在东京召开“贯彻春季斗争、反对批准新安全条约”的青年工人全国大会，讨论今后的斗争计划。
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：四十六个日本妇女团体9日决定，4月16日在全国各地举行群众大会，反对国会通过日美军事同盟条约。
    据日本拥护国民人权妇女协议会宣布，东京这一天将有一万名妇女参加群众大会。
