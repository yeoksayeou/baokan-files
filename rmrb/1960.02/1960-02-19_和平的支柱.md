    Pillar of Peace
    Yang Shaoren, Manager of China Film Distribution and Projection Corporation

    I often recall the days spent with Soviet comrades with excitement. The friendship of the Soviet comrades is something I will never forget. Since liberation, I have visited or passed through the Soviet Union four times. No matter where we were in the Soviet Union, we were warmly received and felt boundless warmth. We saw the flowers of Sino-Soviet friendship blooming everywhere, and everywhere we could hear the sound of "Long live Sino-Soviet unity!"

    We are very happy to see the Soviet large-scale documentary "Unbreakable Friendship" and the large-scale documentary "Great Friendship" produced by our Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio as we warmly celebrate the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. Both films use extremely valuable materials to powerfully illustrate that the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is developing and consolidating day by day. They both vividly confirm what Chairman Mao said ten years ago: The unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union "will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of China and the Soviet Union, but also inevitably affect the future of mankind and the victory of peace and justice in the world."

    The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people has a long history. Whether in our revolutionary war years, in the national liberation war, or in the process of socialist construction, the Soviet people have given us deep concern and great assistance. From the film, we see the spirit of the Soviet Air Force bravely fighting for the freedom and liberation of the Chinese people during the Chinese Anti-Japanese War; we see the great moral support the Soviet Union gave to the Chinese people when American imperialism occupied our Taiwan and provoked us in the Taiwan Strait. "An attack on China is an attack on the Soviet Union!" This powerful and firm voice inspired friends and made enemies tremble!

    In our socialist construction, we see Soviet experts working with us on bridge construction sites, dam construction sites, and various construction sites, day and night, regardless of severe cold or scorching heat, selflessly for the great ideal of socialism-communism and common cause. They regard the happiness of the Chinese people as their own happiness. This great internationalist spirit is deeply moving.

    The cultural exchanges between the Chinese and Soviet people are also extremely close. We are learning advanced Soviet medical technology, and Soviet doctors are also studying our acupuncture; Soviet dancers perform Chinese folk dance - waist drum dance in China, and Chinese girls perform Russian folk dance - Little Birch in the Soviet Union; the exchanges between Mei Lanfang, a famous Chinese opera artist, and Konstantin Stanislavski, a Soviet theater master, twenty-five years ago; "The Man with a Gun" is being performed on the stage in Beijing, and "Lotus Lantern" is being staged in the Soviet theater..., seeing these makes people feel endless joy.

    What is even more exciting is that we see from the film that the flowers of Sino-Soviet friendship are blooming in the hearts of the children of China and the Soviet Union. Chinese children offer wreaths in front of the Soviet Red Army Monument, and the noble friendship of the Soviet people has been firmly engraved in their young hearts. Soviet children are learning to speak Chinese with relish in the classroom. The two children named after the two Soviet destroyers that visited Shanghai in 1956—Qimeng and Zhimou—are already three years old. They are wearing navy uniforms and playing on the lawn in the park. The children are growing up, and the great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union is also growing!

    The unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union is the pillar of world peace. Cherishing the great friendship between our two peoples means cherishing the revolutionary cause of the entire proletariat, and cherishing the cause of world peace!

    和平的支柱
    中国电影发行放映公司经理　杨少任
    我经常怀着激动的心情，忆念着和苏联同志们相处在一起的日子。苏联同志们的友情，是我永远难忘的。解放以来，我曾四度访问苏联或路经苏联。不论在苏联的什么地方，我们都得到热情的接待，感到无限的温暖。我们看到中苏友谊的花朵遍地开放，到处都可以听到“苏中团结万岁”的声音。
    在我们热烈庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订十周年的时候，我们看到了苏联大型纪录片“牢不可破的友谊”和我国中央新闻纪录电影制片厂拍摄的大型纪录片“伟大的友谊”，真是感到十分高兴。这两部影片都以极其珍贵的资料，有力地说明了中苏两国人民的伟大友谊正在日益发展，日益巩固。它们都形象地证实了毛主席在十年前说的话：中苏两大国人民的团结，“不但必然要影响中苏两大国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到全世界和平与正义的胜利。”
    中苏人民的友谊源远流长。无论在我们的革命战争年代里，在民族解放战争中，或者是在社会主义建设进程中，苏联人民对我们都寄予深切的关怀和巨大的援助。从影片里，我们看到苏联空军在中国抗日战争的时候，为中国人民的自由和解放英勇斗争的精神；看到美帝国主义霸占我们的台湾，在台湾海峡向我们寻衅的时候，苏联给中国人民的巨大的道义上的支持。“进攻中国，就是进攻苏联！”这强大而坚定的声音，使朋友振奋，使敌人颤抖！
    在我们进行社会主义的建设中，看到苏联专家和我们一起，在桥梁工地上、在水坝工地上、在各种建筑工地上，不分白天黑夜，不管严寒酷暑，为实现社会主义——共产主义的伟大理想和共同事业忘我地工作着。他们把中国人民的幸福，看成是自己的幸福。这种伟大的国际主义精神，是感人至深的。
    中苏两国人民的文化交往，也极为密切。我们在学习苏联的先进的医学技术，苏联医生也在钻研我们的针灸学；苏联的舞蹈家在中国演出中国民族舞——腰鼓舞，中国的姑娘们在苏联演出俄罗斯的民间舞——小白桦树；二十五年前我国著名的戏曲艺术家梅兰芳和苏联戏剧大师斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基的交往；北京的舞台上在演出“带枪的人”，苏联的剧院里在上演“宝莲灯”……，看到这些，都使人感到无限的欢悦。
    更令人兴奋的是，我们从影片里看到中苏友谊的花朵，正在中苏两国的孩子们的心里开放。中国儿童，在苏联红军纪念碑前献上花圈，他们幼小的心灵里，已经牢牢地铭记着苏联人民的崇高友谊。苏联的孩子们，在教室里津津有味地学讲中国话。以1956年访问上海的苏联两艘驱逐舰命名的两个孩子——启蒙和智谋，已经三岁了。他们穿着海军服，正在公园草地里玩耍，孩子们在成长，中苏两国人民的伟大友谊也在成长！
    中苏两国人民的团结，是世界和平的支柱。珍视我们两国人民的伟大友谊，就是珍视整个无产阶级的革命事业，就是珍视全世界的和平事业！
