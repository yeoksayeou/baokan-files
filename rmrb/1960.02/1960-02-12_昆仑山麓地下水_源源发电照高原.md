Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 11th: The Nachitai area, at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains, 3,700 meters above sea level, recently successfully generated electricity using groundwater. A 4,000-kilowatt turbine generator installed in the newly built hydropower station is continuously supplying electricity for production and lighting to the small iron factory, repair shop, woodworking factory, and government offices there.

Nachitai is located on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains, 92 kilometers from Golmud City in the Qaidam Basin. There are two underground water sources there that converge to form the Nachitai River, which has abundant hydropower resources. During the construction of this plateau hydropower station, local road construction workers, military officers and soldiers, and government cadres all participated in the labor.
