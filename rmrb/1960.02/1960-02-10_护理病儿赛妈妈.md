　　Yang Huilan, a young patient who had been burned, recovered. When her father picked her up from the hospital, he left these words of praise in the comments book: "Comrade Zhou Yulan takes care of children with kindness and consideration, patience and gentleness, truly better than a mother!"
　　Zhou Yulan is a nurse in the burn ward of the Beijing Children's Hospital's surgery department. This young woman treats every child as if they were her own relatives while performing her nursing duties. The sick children also like her. Even the little patients who cannot speak will open their smiling little mouths and reach out their little hands to her when they see her.
　　"Children who are so young are separated from their mothers and need medical staff to take care of them like mothers so that they can reduce their pain and recover quickly!" Zhou Yulan demands this of herself, determined to fulfill her lofty responsibilities in her ordinary work. After the sick child Xi Hui underwent a partial lung resection, she stood in front of the child's bed, sometimes holding Xiao Hui's hand, sometimes stroking the child, and said in a low and kind voice: "Xiao Hui, listen to Auntie, can you cough once?" "Come on, Auntie will press on the wound with her hand, and you can cough gently, it won't hurt the wound." In this way, she helped Xiao Hui cough up the phlegm to avoid the accumulation of sputum and other secretions in the lungs after the operation, which could turn into pneumonia.
　　One day after dusk, a young burn patient, Zhang Yifu, was sent to the ward. Zhou Yulan greeted him and saw a boy of seven years old with burns on his face and neck, and his face was very swollen. At this time, the child's pain felt like it was hurting her heart, and her first thought was to ensure his nutrition so that the child's wound would heal as soon as possible. Zhou Yulan carefully calculated the exudate and urine output of the child, and it was necessary to have an intake of 2,000 milliliters per day. However, the child's lips were so swollen that he could not close them, and it was very difficult to eat and drink water.
　　"Give him an intravenous drip! He is already in enough pain from the burns, and we must not add to the child's suffering." She thought this way. So she discussed with the comrades in the nursing team to study how to ensure the child's nutritional intake and reduce the child's pain. After discussion, everyone decided to do a good deed for Xiao Yifu. At first, they fed him spoonful by spoonful, but the child felt pain when the spoon touched his mouth. She was also worried about contaminating the wound when the rice grains were spilled on his lips. For several days, Zhou Yulan felt uneasy. Whenever she had time, she and several other nurses gathered together to study. Finally, they came up with a good way to inject the patient with a "Dakin's tube." Zhou Yulan added a nipple to one end of the "Dakin's tube" and connected the other end to a rubber ball, and injected it little by little in front of the child's bed. However, burn patients do not like to eat, so she repeatedly persuaded: "Good boy, if you eat a little more, you will get better...". Xiao Yifu opened his eyes to look at her kind smiling face and ate it. In this way, the child's nutrition was guaranteed, and the pain of intravenous infusion was finally avoided.
　　The child's wound surface must be dressed every day, and the scab formed on the wound surface must be cut off. When she was applying saline to moisten and remove the scab, Xiao Yifu cried and refused. Zhou Yulan lay in bed thinking during her rest and thought while eating, trying to find a good way to reduce the pain for the little patient. Sure enough, in the "Pediatrics Manual," she found a record that when changing the dressing after cutting the abscess, anesthesia can be given to relieve the child's pain. From this, she also thought: can't anesthesia be used instead of saline? With the doctor's consent, when she used anesthesia to remove the scab for the child, Xiao Yifu actually said: "Auntie, you can do it, I won't cry." Zhou Yulan takes care of the children in every possible way and has been praised by the children's parents and the hospital.
　　Zhou Yulan is an overseas Chinese who returned from Indonesia in 1953. After returning to China, she studied at the Beijing First Nursing School. After graduating, she was assigned to work in the Children's Hospital. At first, she felt that nursing was an ordinary job and there was no "future." However, under the education of the Party and seeing the suffering of sick children, her thinking gradually changed, and she fell in love with the nursing work. Sometimes there are critically ill children who need special care, and as long as Zhou Yulan knows about it, she is always the first to find the head nurse and ask to work the night shift to take care of the children. Therefore, Zhou Yulan has been successively named a "pacesetter" of the Children's Hospital and an advanced young activist in the Beijing medical community.

    护理病儿赛妈妈
    郭嘉耀　刘佩珩
    烫伤小病人杨惠兰病愈了。她爸爸接她出院时，在意见簿上留下这样几句赞言：“周玉兰同志护理孩子亲切周到、耐心和蔼、真比妈妈还好！”
    周玉兰，是北京市儿童医院外科烧伤病房的护士。这个青年姑娘在担负护理工作中，就像病儿的亲人似地护理着每个孩子。病儿也喜欢她，就连不会说话的小病人见到她，也要张开笑咪咪的小嘴，伸着小手向她扑来。
    “这么小的孩子离开了妈妈，多么需要医护人员像妈妈似地来护理他们，让他们减少痛苦、迅速恢复健康！”周玉兰就是这样地要求自己，决心在平凡的工作中，尽到自己崇高的职责。病儿奚惠作了肺部的部分切除手术后，她站在病儿床前，有时拉着小惠的手，有时又抚摸着病儿，低声而亲切地说：“小惠听阿姨的话，咳嗽一声好吗？”“来，阿姨用手按着伤口，你轻轻地咳嗽一声，伤口不会痛的。”这样，她帮助小惠把痰咳嗽出来，以免手术后肺部存有痰液等分泌物，转成肺炎。
    一天黄昏后，病房里送来一个烫伤小病人张毅夫。周玉兰迎上去，只见一个七岁多的小男孩，脸部和颈部都是烫伤，脸部肿的很厉害。这时，孩子的病痛像疼在她的心上，第一个念头就是要保证他的营养，使病儿伤口早日愈合。周玉兰仔细地算了病儿流出的渗出液和排出的尿量，每天要有二千毫升入量才行。但是病儿的嘴唇肿得很厚，不能闭上，吃饭喝水都很困难。
    “给他打点滴输液吧！烫得够痛苦了，不能再增加孩子的痛苦。”她这样想。于是她就和护理小组的同志商量，研究怎样保证病儿营养量，又减少病儿的痛苦。经过商量，大家决定每个人给小毅夫作一件好事。最初，她们用小勺一勺一勺地喂，羹匙一碰到嘴，病儿很疼。饭粒撒在嘴唇上，她又耽心污染伤面。好几天，周玉兰心里都不安。一有时间，她就和另外几个护士凑到一起研究。最后，她们终于想出用“迨金氏管”为病人注入的好办法。周玉兰把“迨金氏管”的一端加一奶头，另一端接象皮球，在病儿床前一点点地注入。但是烧伤病人却不喜欢吃东西，她就一遍一遍地劝说：“好乖，再吃一点病就好了……。”小毅夫睁开眼睛看看她那副亲切的笑脸、也就吃下去了。就这样保证了病儿的营养，终于免去了输液的痛苦。
    病儿的伤面每天要换药，伤面上结成的皮痂要剪掉。当她用盐水湿敷脱痂时，小毅夫就哭着闹着不肯。周玉兰在休息时躺在床上想，吃饭时也想，尽量想寻找个好办法为小病人减少痛苦。果然在“儿科手册”上，发现记载有切脓包后换药时，可打麻药解除病儿痛苦。从这儿她又连想到：用麻药代替盐水不是也可以吗？征得大夫的同意，她用麻药为病儿脱痂的时候，小毅夫居然说：“阿姨你弄吧，我不哭。”周玉兰就是这样千方百计地护理着孩子，得到病儿家长的表扬，也得到医院的好评。
    周玉兰，是1953年从印度尼西亚归国的华侨。回国后，就到北京第一护士学校学习。毕业后，分配到儿童医院工作。起初，她还觉得护士是个平凡工作，没有什么“前途”。但是，她在党的教育下，并看到病儿受病魔折磨的情景，思想逐步有了转变，热爱上护士工作。有时有重病儿需要专人护理，只要周玉兰知道，她总是第一个找到护士长，要求值夜班护理孩子。因此周玉兰曾先后被评为儿童医院的“标兵”、北京市医务界青年积极分子。
