    Solving Key Production Problems and Cultivating Junior Technical Talents
    Yongfu Commune's Science and Technology Network Demonstrates its Power

    (Our report) The Yongfu Commune in Zhangping County, Fujian Province, has established a science and technology network centered around the Agricultural Science Institute, Agricultural Technology Extension Station, and Agricultural Middle School, vigorously carrying out mass scientific research activities. Over the past year, the scientific research achievements have been remarkable, powerfully promoting the high-speed development of agricultural production and cultivating a group of junior technical talents.

    In 1959, in order to further strengthen scientific research work, the Commune Party Committee combined the existing Agricultural Science Institute, Agricultural Technology Station, and Agricultural Middle School into a mass science and technology center and a base for promoting advanced agricultural technologies, driving the broad masses to carry out scientific research activities. The First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee concurrently served as the Director of the Agricultural Science Institute, and the Deputy Director of the Agricultural Science Institute concurrently served as the Vice Principal of the Agricultural Middle School, implementing unified leadership. The technical cadres of the Agricultural Technology Station also served as technicians of the Agricultural Science Institute and teachers of agricultural knowledge courses in the Agricultural Middle School; the researchers of the Agricultural Science Institute also served as teachers of the Agricultural Middle School and production technology instructors; the teachers of the Agricultural Middle School also served as cultural teachers in the Agricultural Science Institute's spare-time night school. These three units jointly operated a small experimental base covering a total area of 20.5 mu. The Agricultural Science Institute and the Agricultural Middle School retained their original large field cultivation areas to support the small-area experiments with the large fields. They implemented the method of promoting small-area experiences in large fields and spreading them throughout the commune, so that the successful scientific experiences from the small-area experiments gradually blossomed and bore fruit throughout the commune. This combination had three advantages: First, it facilitated the Party Committee's strengthening of unified leadership; second, research, promotion, teaching, and labor were more closely integrated, which could improve the quality of scientific research and teaching; and third, it could more powerfully promote and guide mass scientific research activities. With the help of the Commune's Science and Technology Center, all seventeen brigades in the commune also selected a group of commune members with rich production experience and a certain level of education as researchers and established brigade-level agricultural science research stations. Production teams established research groups, and the Commune Agricultural Science Institute hired the researchers of the brigade-level agricultural science research stations as special researchers. The brigade researchers had their own experimental bases; they were both researchers and producers, both promoters and propagandists, and were responsible for guiding the scientific research activities of the entire brigade. Each brigade's agricultural science research station hired technicians from the production teams as special researchers. Under the guidance of the technicians, each production team had mass experimental plots and temporary experimental groups for various crops, composed of veteran farmers, young people, women, and militia members. In this way, a science and technology network was formed. The Commune Science and Technology Center held a meeting of special researchers from various brigades once a month, and the researchers of the brigade-level agricultural science research stations also held meetings of special researchers from various production teams. The production team technicians were responsible for contacting the masses. They conducted research, imparted knowledge, and promoted technologies at all levels, ensuring communication between higher and lower levels and exchanges in all directions, greatly enriching the research content, strengthening research activities, and rapidly and powerfully promoting production. Over the past year, the Commune Science and Technology Center organized a total of 38 agricultural technology publicity and dissemination activities, held 16 on-site observation meetings with the participation of more than 2,600 people, and disseminated scientific research results through various mass gatherings and using propaganda teams, big-character posters, and printed reference materials, creating a vigorous atmosphere of "everyone learning science and everyone using science" throughout the commune.

    Under the direct leadership of the Party Committee, the Commune Science and Technology Center determined the research policy of "taking grain as the key link, and simultaneously developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries" that was oriented towards production, and the teaching policy of cultivating junior technical cadres for the four modernizations of agriculture for the commune. According to the principles of "combining professional research with mass research activities," "combining scientific research with summarizing mass experiences," and "serving high-yield fields and general fields with small-area comparisons," and based on the natural characteristics of Yongfu, such as high mountains, cold water, and high air humidity, as well as the problems urgently to be solved in current production, they formulated research projects. In addition to conducting research on important projects such as "preventing seedling rot in spring sowing," they also carried out research on projects such as "cultivation of excellent fruit varieties" and "intercropping multiple economic crops to increase production without increasing land."

    The more than 100 research activities carried out by Yongfu Commune over the past year have solved many key problems in agricultural production, opening up a smooth road for continued great leaps forward. For example, in carrying out the research on the important project of "preventing seedling rot in spring sowing," veteran farmer researchers provided practical data on local weather evolution. Through research and analysis, they derived the basic climate rule that "after several days of extreme cold, there will be several days of warming." Then, based on the scientific argument in the books that "seeds should maintain a temperature above 8 degrees Celsius for about five days after being sown in the ground," they soaked the seeds in warm water during the extremely cold days and sowed them as soon as the cold weather passed, effectively protecting the seedlings from cold damage and successfully creating the scientific experience of "soaking seeds more when it is colder and sowing seeds as soon as the cold weather passes." In conjunction with the research on this project, the Commune Party Committee held several on-site observation meetings in the experimental fields in stages, explaining and imparting knowledge to the researchers of various brigades and listening to their opinions, conducting research and promotion simultaneously, ensuring that more than 90% of the seedlings sown before and after "Jingzhe" (Awakening of Insects) throughout the commune did not suffer from seedling rot, and achieving the plan of changing 15,000 mu of single-season rice to double-cropping rice throughout the year, which enabled the total grain output of the commune in 1959 to increase by 55.8% compared to 1958.

    Many inventions and creations of the masses at the grassroots level throughout the commune have also been promoted through the science and technology network, promoting continuous great leaps forward in production. For example, the experimental group of Luocheng Production Team in Fuli Brigade conducted a "comparative experiment on close planting of large-grain winter rice in mountain cold water" in one mu of terraced fields, and compared ten specifications ranging from 2×7 inches to one chi square, combined with reasonable fertilization, irrigation and other measures, and made detailed field records. The results showed that the 7×6 inch specification had the highest yield, equivalent to 790 jin per mu, while the one-chi square specification had a yield of only 230 jin per mu. After the production team technician reported, the Commune Agricultural Science Institute and the Brigade Agricultural Science Research Station dispatched technical cadres and researchers to jointly organize an acceptance team to conduct a scientific assessment in the field and write a conclusion as a basis for promotion.

    The scientific research achievements of the entire commune were remarkable, and five major harvests were obtained in ideology, research, technology, learning, and production. Two of the thirteen full-time farmer researchers in the Agricultural Science Institute have reached the junior middle school education level, five have reached the higher primary school level, and three have been able to study intermediate agricultural science books on their own and conduct experimental research in connection with reality. Some people have been called the commune's "agronomy experts" by the commune members. The agricultural science and technology level of the 919 researchers at the brigade level has also greatly improved. The teaching effect of the agricultural knowledge course in the Agricultural Middle School has also been greatly improved. All students in the school have mastered one or more of the elementary agricultural techniques such as carpentry, bamboo work, plowing, harrowing, and rice transplanting. They have been able to make wooden wheelbarrows, direct seeders, and repair various farm tools on their own. Some people have also learned tractor driving techniques.

    The Commune Science and Technology Center, jointly established by the Agricultural Science Institute, the Agricultural Technology Station, and the Agricultural Middle School, promoted the commune-wide development of experimental fields and high-yield fields, and achieved great success. According to statistics, in 1959, the early and late rice experimental fields and high-yield fields in the commune totaled 4,894 mu, with an average yield of 721 jin per mu, and a maximum of 1,400 jin per mu; the single-season late rice experimental fields and high-yield fields totaled 1,421 mu, with an average yield of 684 jin per mu, and a maximum of 1,051 jin per mu. The yields of these experimental fields and high-yield fields were 20% to one or two times higher than those of ordinary fields. The achievements of experimental fields and high-yield fields for various economic crops were also very prominent. In addition, scientific research activities were also carried out in animal husbandry, forestry, and other fields.

    The mass movement of Yongfu Commune to vigorously carry out scientific and technological experimental research has brought about a new leap forward situation of great development of production and comprehensive bumper harvests.

    解决生产关键问题　培养初级技术人材
    永福公社科学技术网发挥威力
    本报讯　福建省漳平县永福公社建立了以农业科学研究所、农业技术推广站和农业中学三单位为中心的科学技术网，大搞群众性科学研究活动。一年来科学研究成果辉煌，有力地促进了农业生产的高速度发展，培养了一批初级技术人材。
    1959年公社党委为了进一步加强科学研究工作，把现有的农业科学研究所、农业技术站和农业中学三个单位联合起来，组成一个群众性的科学技术中心和推广先进农业技术的基地，带动广大群众开展科学研究活动。公社党委第一书记兼任农业科学研究所所长，农业科学研究所副所长兼农业中学副校长，实行一元化领导。农业技术站的技术干部兼农业科学研究所的技术员和农业中学的农业知识课教员；农业科学研究所的研究员兼农业中学教员和生产技术指导；农业中学教员兼农业科学研究所的业余夜校文化教员。这三个单位共同经营一个面积共二十亩半的小区试验基地。农业科学研究所和农业中学都保留本单位原有的大田耕作区，以大田养小区试验。他们实行小区经验大田推广、全社推开的方法，使小区试验成功的科学经验，逐步在全社开花结果。这样联合起来有三个优越性：一、便于党委加强统一领导；二、研究、推广、教学、劳动更紧密地结合，能提高科学研究和教学质量；三、能更有力地推动和指导群众性的科学研究活动。在公社科学技术中心的帮助下，全社十七个大队也都选拔一批有丰富生产经验和有一定文化水平的社员为研究员，分别建立大队农业科学研究站。各生产队成立研究小组，公社农业科学研究所聘请大队农业科学研究站的研究员为特约研究员。大队研究员都有自己的试验基地，他们既是研究员又是生产者，既是推广员又是宣传员，担负指导全大队开展科学研究活动的任务。各大队农业科学研究站都聘请生产队的技术员为特约研究员。在技术员的指导下，各生产队都有老农、青年、妇女、民兵等群众性的试验田和各种作物的临时性试验小组。这样，就形成了一个科学技术网。公社科学技术中心每月召开一次各大队特约研究员会议，大队农业科学研究站研究员也召开各生产队特约研究员会议，生产队技术员负责联系群众，层层研究、传授、推广，上下通气，四面交流，大大丰富了研究内容，加强了研究活动，迅速而有力地推动了生产。一年来公社科学研究中心共组织了三十八次农业技术宣传、传授活动，召开了十六次共二千六百多人参加的现场观摩会议，并通过各种群众集会，运用宣传队、大字报、印发参考材料等方式传播科学研究成果，在全社掀起了轰轰烈烈的“全民学科学，人人用科学”的局面。
    公社科学研究中心在党委直接领导下，确定了“以粮为主，农林牧副渔同时并举”的面向生产的研究方针和为公社培养农业现代四化初级技术干部的教学方针，按照“专业研究与群众研究活动相结合”、“科学研究与总结群众经验相结合”、“小区对比为高产田、一般田服务”等原则，根据永福山高水冷、空气湿度大等自然特点和当前生产中急待解决的问题，订定了研究项目。他们除了进行“春播不烂秧”等重要项目的研究以外，还结合进行了“水果优良品种的培育”、“多种经济作物套种增产不增地”等项目的研究。
    永福公社一年来所进行的一百多项研究活动，解决了许多农业生产上的关键性问题，为继续大跃进打开了顺利的道路。例如，在进行“春播不烂秧”这个重要项目研究中，老农研究员提供了当地天气演变的实践资料。经过研究分析，得出“大冷几天后必转暖几天”的气候基本规律，然后根据书本上“种子下地五天左右应保持摄氏八度以上气温”的科学论据，在大冷天用温汤浸种，冷天一过就播种，使秧苗有效地免受寒冷侵袭，并加强科学管理，成功地创造了“越冷越浸种，冷过就下种”的科学经验。结合这个项目的研究，公社党委分段在试验田召开了好几次现场观摩会，向各大队研究员讲解、传授并听取意见，边研究、边推广，保证了全社90％以上在“惊蛰”前后播种的秧苗都没有发生烂秧，实现了全年水稻单改双一万五千亩的计划，使全社1959年粮食总产量比1958年增产55．8％。
    全社基层群众的许多发明创造也通过科学技术网得到了推广，促使生产不断大跃进。如福里大队罗城生产队试验小组在一亩梯田里作“山坑冷水大冬稻密植对比试验”，分插2×7到一尺见方十种规格进行对比，配合合理施肥、灌溉等措施，并作详细的田间记录，结果7×6寸产量最高，折合亩产七百九十斤，一尺见方折合亩产只有二百三十几斤。生产队技术员汇报后，公社农业科学研究所和大队农业科学研究站派出技术干部和研究员联合组织验收小组到田头进行科学鉴定，并写出结论作为推广依据。
    全社科学研究成效卓著，获得了思想、研究、技术、学习、生产五大丰收。农业科学研究所现有的十三个专职农民研究员，有两个已达到初中文化水平，有五个已达高小水平，有三个人已能自学中级农业科学书籍，并能联系实际进行试验研究。有的人已被社员们称为公社的“农艺专家”。大队级九百十九个研究员的农业科学技术水平也有了很大提高。农业中学农业知识课的教学效果也有很大提高，全校学生都掌握了木工、竹工、犁田、耙田、插秧等一种以上的农业初级技术，他们已能自制木轮车、直播机和修理各种农具，有的人还学会了拖拉机驾驶技术。
    农业科学研究所、农业技术站和农业中学三联合的公社科学技术中心，推动了全社大搞试验田、丰产田，获得很大的成就。据统计，1959年全社早晚稻试验田和丰产田四千八百九十四亩，平均单产七百二十一斤，最高达到一千四百斤；单季晚稻的试验田、丰产田一千四百二十一亩，平均亩产六百八十四斤，最高达一千零五十一斤。这些试验田、丰产田的产量都比一般田高出20％到一、二倍。多种经济作物的试验田、丰产田的成就也很突出。此外，还开展了畜牧、林业等方面的科学研究活动。
    永福公社大搞科学技术试验研究的群众运动，带来了生产大发展、全面大丰收的新的跃进局面。
