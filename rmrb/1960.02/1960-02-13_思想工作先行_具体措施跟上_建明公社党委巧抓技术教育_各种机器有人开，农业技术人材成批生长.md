    Ideological Work Comes First, Concrete Measures Follow
    Jianming Commune Party Committee Skillfully Grasps Technical Education
    Various Machines Have Operators, Agricultural Technical Talents Grow in Batches
    Specific methods: General technical education is carried out for ordinary commune members based on the production season; single-item technical research groups are established using spare-time schools as a base, with the main targets of cultivation being production leaders, labor models, and veteran farmers; spare-time technical schools and training classes are held, and methods such as master-apprentice are adopted to learn mechanical operation technology.
    (By Our Newspaper) The Jianming People's Commune Party Committee in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, strengthens its leadership over spare-time technical education and adopts various methods to rapidly cultivate technical talents to meet the needs of increasingly developing production.
    Since last year, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line and giving full play to the superiority of the People's Commune, the agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries of the Jianming Commune have developed rapidly. At the same time, with the increase of public accumulation, the commune began to have its own modern agricultural equipment such as tractors, locomobiles, and automobiles. However, the commune lacked technical talents, and no one knew how to operate the machines, which affected production. Therefore, the broad masses reflected: "Mechanization and electrification, without culture, cannot be realized," "Machines are good, machines are good, but they cannot be operated without technology." Faced with this situation, the commune Party committee conducted research and took active measures to run spare-time education on a large scale, rapidly improving the political, cultural, and technical level of the masses, while especially strengthening leadership over spare-time technical education.
    In the process of running technical education, the vast majority of people were active, confident, and full of energy, but a few people did not have a sufficient understanding of its significance and had a fear of difficulty. In response to this situation, the commune Party committee used various occasions and different forms to carry out extensive publicity, explaining the current excellent situation and favorable conditions, highlighting the important significance of learning technology and realizing agricultural modernization, and using the fact that Wang Guangzhi and Du Zenglai, who were originally illiterate, had become tractor drivers after hard study to conduct education. All production teams universally carried out open discussions on topics such as "Is it possible to realize agricultural modernization without technology?" and "How to carry out technical study?" which greatly improved the understanding of cadres and the masses. Xiaochang Production Team posted more than 2,500 big-character posters and letters of determination, expressing their determination to learn technology. After inspection, Zhao Zhuangzi Production Team found that there were insufficient teachers, and immediately re-elected 18 technical teachers, reversing the situation where someone was in charge of culture but no one was in charge of technology.
    In order to strengthen the leadership of technical education, the original learning committees at all levels were changed to cultural and technical revolution committees. The commune was headed by Zhang Zilin, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee, and leaders and cadres from education, technology extension stations, science popularization associations, tractor stations, and repair shops were absorbed as members to specifically manage technical education. Management areas and production brigades were also headed by the Party Committee Secretary, and the "double management" (commune and team cadres manage production and learning) and "six unifications" (unified leadership, unified arrangement, unified deployment, unified inspection, unified reporting, unified evaluation) were universally implemented, combining production and cultural and technical learning and carrying them out in a complementary manner.
    In spare-time technical education, Jianming Commune adopted flexible and diverse forms. (1) General agricultural technical education is carried out for ordinary commune members based on the production season. For example, in spring, they teach land preparation and moisture conservation, seed treatment, and in summer, they teach crop field management, manure accumulation, and top dressing. Through learning, students gain general basic agricultural knowledge. Two thousand one hundred students in the commune participated in this study. (2) Single-item technical research groups are established using spare-time schools as a base. According to the situation of each production team and the needs of the students in production, several technical research groups are set up within the same spare-time school. The main participants in the study are production leaders, students from production professional teams, labor models, and experienced veteran farmers. In addition to general technical learning, the study focuses on single-item technologies, such as wheat, corn, millet, fruit trees, poultry, and livestock. There are currently 77 single-item technical research groups and 15 professional technical research groups in the commune, with 1,230 students. (3) Run spare-time technical schools and short-term training classes. In order to rapidly cultivate agricultural machinery technical talents, 35 politically progressive in-town junior high school graduates and outstanding students from spare-time elementary schools with potential for training were selected and linked with the tractor station to establish a spare-time technical school, adopting short-term training, spare-time learning, and master-apprentice methods to learn mechanical operation technology. The learning time is also flexibly arranged. During busy production periods, they study in their spare time (mostly at night), learning politics once a week, technology four times a week, and culture once a week. When production is not too busy, in addition to spare-time study, they also spend two or three half-days a week learning.
    The solution to technical teachers and teaching materials adopted a method of unified leadership, responsibility by department, utilizing local materials, and self-cultivation, that is, that kind of technology, that department is responsible for teaching and solving teaching materials, implementing technical "centralization." For example, the technical school run concurrently by the tractor station is taught technical courses by technicians in the station, and agricultural technology is guided by the technology extension station. At the same time, business cadres from technology extension stations and agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy departments and cadres with professional knowledge who have been transferred to lower levels for labor training are often invited to give technical lectures. Technical teaching materials are mainly compiled by various departments and printed and distributed by the commune or production brigade. In 1959 alone, the technology extension station compiled 17 kinds of single-item technical teaching materials such as "Seed Storage," "Winter Wheat Management," "Soil Improvement," "Pest and Disease Prevention," and "Scientific Manure Accumulation Method," solving the problem of teaching materials.
    Technical education is carried out based on the principle of combining learning what is done with systematic improvement. All technical studies first clarify scientific principles and basic knowledge through classroom teaching, and then master operating techniques through experiments and practice, truly achieving understanding and learning. The Jingziyu Fertilizer Technology Research Group of Xiaochang Brigade, after learning the basic knowledge of the performance and function of the three elements of fertilizer (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium), after research, mixed dry cattle manure, sheep manure, chicken manure, and yellow soil to trial-produce more than 9,000 catties of two kinds of soil fertilizer, continuously top-dressing wheat twice, and strengthened management, making 77 mu of hillside wheat reach a yield of 470 catties per mu, becoming a high-yield pacesetter. Li Dehua, Wei Shunshan, and others from the Bai Mayu Livestock Breeding Farm Technical Research Group, after learning and repeated research experiments, used pregnant women's urine to make indigenous estrus-inducing agents and learned artificial insemination methods, making 95% of 108 female livestock pregnant.
    In the past year or so, Jianming Commune has adopted the above methods and has cultivated a group of technical personnel and management cadres. At present, it has cultivated 15 tractor drivers, 10 irrigation and drainage machine operators, 2 automobile drivers, and 1,820 agricultural technicians. There are 73 fruit tree technicians, 182 technical talents in animal husbandry, beekeeping, and fish farming, and 71 management cadres. Each production team already has 10 to 15 technicians, 5 to 10 management cadres, and indigenous experts. This has created good conditions for realizing agricultural technical transformation and promoting further development of production.

    思想工作先行  具体措施跟上
    建明公社党委巧抓技术教育
    各种机器有人开，农业技术人材成批生长
    具体办法：以一般社员为对象，根据生产季节，进行一般的技术教育；以业余学校为基地，建立单项技术研究小组，培养的对象主要是生产领导干部、劳动模范和老农等；举办业余技术学校和训练班，采取师傅带徒弟等办法，学习机械操作技术。
    本报讯　河北省遵化县建明人民公社党委加强对业余技术教育的领导，采取各种方式迅速培养技术人材，以适应生产日益发展的需要。
    去年以来，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，建明公社农、林、牧、副、渔得到迅速发展。同时随着公共积累的增多，社里开始有了自己的拖拉机、锅驼机、汽车等现代化农业装备。但是社里缺乏技术人材，没有人会开动机器，使生产受到影响。因而广大群众反映：“机械化，电气化，没有文化不能化”，“机器好，机器好，没有技术开不了”。面对这种形势，公社党委作了研究，他们就采取积极措施，大办业余教育，迅速提高群众政治文化技术水平，同时特别加强了对业余技术教育的领导。
    在举办技术教育过程中，绝大多数是积极的，信心足，干劲大，但也有少数人对它的意义认识不足，有畏难情绪。公社党委针对这种情况，利用各种场合和不同形式，开展了广泛的宣传，讲解当前的大好形势和有利条件，大讲学习技术和实现农业现代化的重要意义，并用原来是文盲的王广之、杜增来经过刻苦学习，已成为拖拉机手的事实进行教育。各生产队都普遍以“实现农业现代化没有技术行不行”，“如何开展技术学习”等为题，开展了鸣放辩论，大大提高了干部和群众的认识。小厂生产队就贴出大字报、决心书二千五百多张，表示学习技术的决心。赵庄子生产队经过检查发现教师不足，马上补选了十八名技术教师，扭转了有人管文化，无人管技术的局面。
    为加强技术教育的领导，将原来的各级学习委员会改为文化技术革命委员会。公社由党委副书记张子林同志挂帅，并吸收教育、技术推广站、科学普及协会、拖拉机站、修配厂等部门领导干部为委员，具体管理技术教育。管理区、生产大队也由党委书记挂帅，普遍推行了“双管”（社队干部管生产、管学习），“六统一”（统一领导、统一安排、统一布置、统一检查、统一汇报、统一评比），将生产和文化技术学习拧在一起，相辅进行。
    在业余技术教育中，建明公社采取了灵活多样的形式。（1）以一般社员为对象，根据生产季节，进行一般的农业技术教育。如在春季就讲整地保墒、种籽处理，夏季就讲作物田间管理、积肥、追肥等。通过学习，使学员获得一般的农业基本知识。全社参加这种学习的学员有两千一百人。（2）以业余学校为基地，建立单项技术研究小组，按各个生产队的情况和学员在生产上的需要，在同一业余学校内设若干技术研究小组。参加学习的主要是生产领导干部、生产专业队学员、劳动模范和有生产经验的老农。学习内容除结合一般技术学习外，着重研究单项技术，如小麦、玉米、谷子、果树、家禽、家畜等。全社现有单项技术研究组七十七个，专业技术研究组十五个，学员一千二百三十人。（3）举办业余技术学校和短期训练班。为迅速培养农业机械技术人材，曾选拔了政治进步、有培养前途的在乡初中毕业生和业余初等学校的优秀学员三十五人，和拖拉机站挂钩建立了业余技术学校，采取短期训练、业余学习和以师带徒等办法，学习机械操作技术。学习时间也是灵活安排。在生产紧张时期，都是在业余时间（多在晚上）学习，每周学习一次政治，四次技术，一次文化。在生产不太忙的时间，除业余学习外，每周还抽两三个半天的时间进行学习。
    技术教师和教材的解决，采用了统一领导、条条负责，就地取材、自行培养的方法，也就是那一类技术，就由那一部门负责传授和解决教材，实行技术“归口”。如拖拉机站兼办的技术学校，就由站内的技师讲技术课，农业技术便由技术推广站负责指导等。同时还经常聘请技术推广站和农、林、水利部门的业务干部和有专业知识的下放劳动锻炼的干部给讲技术课。技术教材主要由各部门编写，公社或生产大队印发。1959年仅技术推广站就编写了“种子保管”、“冬季小麦管理”、“改良土壤”、“防止病虫害”、“科学积肥法”等十七种单项技术教材，解决了教材的问题。
    技术教育本着做啥学啥和系统提高相结合的原则进行。各项技术学习，都是首先通过课堂教学讲清科学道理和基本知识，然后再通过试验实习，掌握操作技术，真正做到学懂学会。小厂大队粳子峪肥料技术研究小组，学习了肥料的三要素（氮、磷、钾）性能、作用等基本知识以后，经过研究，用牛粪干、羊粪、鸡粪和黄土面混合，试制成两种土化肥九千余斤，给小麦连续追肥两次，并加强了管理，使七十七亩山坡地小麦达到亩产四百七十斤，成为高产标兵。白马峪牲畜繁殖场技术研究小组的李德华、魏顺胜等，经过学习、多次研究试验，用孕妇尿制成土法催情剂，并学会了人工授精法，使一百零八头母畜95％怀了胎。
    一年多来，建明公社采取上述方法，已培养出一批技术人员和管理干部。目前已培养出拖拉机手十五名，排灌机械手十名，汽车司机二名，农业技术员一千八百二十人。果树技术员七十三人，畜牧、养蜂、养鱼等技术人材一百八十二人，管理干部七十一人。每个生产小队已有十至十五名技术员，五至十名管理干部和土专家。这对实现农业技术改造、推动生产进一步发展，创造了良好的条件。
