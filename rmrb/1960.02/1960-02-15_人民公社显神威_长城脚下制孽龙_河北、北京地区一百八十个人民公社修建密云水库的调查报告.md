People's Commune Investigation

	People's Communes Show Their Power: Subduing the Evil Dragon at the Foot of the Great Wall
	An Investigative Report on the Construction of the Miyun Reservoir by 180 People's Communes in Hebei and Beijing
	By the Miyun Reservoir Investigation Group of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

		A Miracle of the Commune Era

	Two "evil dragons" – the Chao River and the Bai River – were conquered in a very short period of time. This event fully reflects the strength of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and also demonstrates the power of the newborn People's Commune illuminated by the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

	These two "evil dragons" have ravaged the northeast of North China for thousands of years. How many people have been displaced and lost their families because of them! However, once the era of the People's Commune arrived, they could no longer run wild! One hundred and eighty People's Communes in twenty-two nearby counties (districts) organized an army of 200,000 commune members to conquer the Chao and Bai Rivers. Under the unified leadership and command of the Party, they fought the "evil dragons" and subdued them at the foot of the Great Wall in less than a year, obediently serving the people.

	This is the Miyun Reservoir, located in the northeast corner of the capital.

	The shape of this reservoir resembles a large crab. Its right claw clamps the Chao River, which originates in Fengning County, and its left claw clamps the Bai River, which originates in Zhangbei County. The roaring, surging river water is swallowed and "digested" here, and finally obeys the orders of the people, gushing out clear water from several tunnels arranged for them, flowing into the Bohai Sea near Tanggu. From then on, the flood threat of the Chao and Bai Rivers was fundamentally controlled, four million mu of dry land will be transformed into fertile fields, and the two major cities of Beijing and Tianjin will receive 28 cubic meters per second of industrial water, bringing huge water conservancy benefits to the four million people living in the Chao and Bai River basin and the two major cities of Beijing and Tianjin.

	The reservoir project consists of the Chao River and Bai River main dams, nine secondary dams, and structures such as corridors, tunnels, power stations, and spillways. The crest elevation of the dam is 160 meters above sea level. When it reaches the designed maximum water level of 157.5 meters, its storage capacity is 4.1 billion cubic meters, and the water surface area is 200 square kilometers, slightly smaller than Tai Lake and larger than West Lake. The main dam and secondary dams are 5,500 meters long in total, and the total filling volume of the dam is 20,705,000 cubic meters. Including excavation and auxiliary projects, the total volume of earth and stone work reaches 37 million cubic meters. Compared with several famous reservoirs that have already been built in our country, its earth dam engineering volume is about 20 times that of the Guanting Reservoir, 6 times that of the Nanwan Reservoir, 2 times that of the Dahuo房 Reservoir, and 2 times that of the Gangnan Reservoir. It is currently the largest comprehensive reservoir in our country in terms of engineering volume. Under normal circumstances, the construction of such a reservoir would require one to two years of preparation time and four to five years of construction period. However, with the emergence of the People's Commune, people relied on its enormous power to break through conventions and create a high-speed model for large-scale project construction while ensuring project quality. Construction started in September 1958, flood control was achieved in July 1959, and completion is expected before the flood season in 1960. That is to say, flood control in ten months, benefits received in the same year, and complete construction in less than two years. This is a major miracle in the history of reservoir construction.

	Building the Miyun Reservoir and fundamentally controlling the Chao and Bai Rivers is such an exciting event for the four million people in the Chao and Bai River basin! After the news spread, the entire Chao and Bai River basin was abuzz. Applications to participate in the reservoir construction flew to the People's Communes like snowflakes. The enthusiasm of the commune members is entirely understandable. In the old society, they suffered from the scourge of the "evil dragons" and never dared to dream of building a reservoir. Now, with the leadership of the Party and the People's Commune as a strong backing, a great aspiration is about to be realized. At the Party's call, one hundred and eighty People's Communes, both benefiting and non-benefiting, sent their best young men and the most outstanding cadres within about ten days, carrying the instructions of their hometown elders to "resolutely block the water" and "win honor for the commune," carrying food, lodging, and various tools for labor, heading mightily towards the reservoir construction site. More than two months later, an army of 200,000 reservoir builders arrived at the construction site as scheduled.

	Two hundred thousand people is an extraordinary number, equivalent to about one-tenth of the total labor force of the twenty-two counties (districts) sending out laborers. Even if the entire Beijing market were to supply their food, lodging, and necessities, it would not be able to keep up for a while. At the same time, the elderly and children who rely on these 200,000 people for their livelihood number more than 500,000. Moreover, the time is not short, it will be one to two years. How can they be ensured to participate in the reservoir construction with peace of mind for a long time? In the past, it would have been difficult to imagine solving these problems. However, the People's Commune accomplished this major task as soon as it was established.

		How 200,000 Laborers Were Excavated

	How did the People's Commune solve these problems?

	When the laborers began their expedition, some well-meaning people worried: "If so many people are drawn out to build the reservoir in the first year of the commune's establishment, will it affect the commune's production?" This concern is understandable under normal circumstances, but they did not see the superiority of the People's Commune. Because, after communization, people were first liberated from housework; also, people's ideological awareness was improved; production organization was improved; and production tools were reformed, all of which greatly increased productivity.

	Previously, almost every family of five had one laborer busy with housework. After communization, cooking, clothing, raising children, etc., were basically replaced by collective welfare organizations such as canteens, nurseries, and sewing groups run by the commune. They turned to engage in the commune's productive labor or service labor. The Zhongsu Youhao (Sino-Soviet Friendship) People's Commune in Fengtai District, which sent out laborers, had the equivalent of 2,966 people engaged in housework before communization. Now the change is: 645 people still engaged in individual housework, 669 people engaged in commune service labor, and 1,652 people engaged in commune production labor. The Xionger营 No. 2 Production Team of the Chengguan People's Commune in Pinggu County had 22 people engaged in housework before communization. Now all of them participate in commune labor: 6 are cooks, 3 are childminders, 2 are sewers, and the other 11 are all engaged in commune production labor. That is to say, of the 100 people who were engaged in consumer labor in the past, after communization, in the Shijingshan Zhongsu Youhao People's Commune near the big city, 56 people have been transformed into engaging in productive labor. In the Xionger营 No. 2 Production Team near the mountainous area, 50 people have been transformed into engaging in productive labor. According to a not very precise statistic of the twenty-two counties (districts) sending out laborers, before communization, the equivalent of 1,117,994 people were engaged in housework. After communization, in addition to 26% of the people still engaged in individual housework, 21% of the people were engaged in commune service labor, and 53% of the people were engaged in commune productive labor. That is, after more than 820,000 people were liberated from housework, more than 230,000 people participated in commune service labor, and more than 590,000 people participated in commune productive labor. The number of people directly participating in commune production labor is almost equivalent to three times the total number of laborers sent out by these twenty-two counties (districts).

	People who have been freed from housework, which is characterized by tedious individual labor, feel relaxed, happy, and can concentrate on creative labor. Li Xirong, a female laborer from the Baodi detachment, has a family of five. Before communization, she participated in production half the time and took care of housework the other half. At that time, she got up before dawn to make breakfast, went home at noon to cook, wash pots, and wash dishes, could not take a nap, and went to bed later than others at night. Therefore, she was mentally exhausted and her production efficiency was not high. When it came to sewing clothes and socks, she had to take a break from work, and she also had to take a day off every ten days or so to grind grain. She could only record 900 work points a year. After communization, she became a cook at the construction site, with no worries, and she worked very actively. She and three other cooks made food for more than 200 laborers. According to her labor situation at the reservoir, the commune recorded 1,800 work points for her in 1959. She can also save about ten yuan a month from the allowance issued by the reservoir. Wang Jianhua, the leader of the famous Ten Sisters Assault Team of the Miyun Detachment, has a family of fifteen. She herself is a good laborer and always earns first-class work points. However, before communization, she could not attend work full-time. The needlework at home was all done by her and her mother. After communization, her grandmother took care of the elderly at home, and her four young nephews entered primary school and kindergarten. All ten adults took on the labor they could handle. Her mother worked in the sewing group, and she herself made outstanding achievements at the reservoir construction site. Now she is a glorious member of the Communist Party. From the changes in these two ordinary people and their families, we can see how much the labor potential hidden in them has been brought into play under the conditions of the People's Commune!

	The potential excavated from the unified allocation of labor is also amazing. In these one hundred and eighty People's Communes, usually, according to the production tasks, the specialties and physical strength of the commune members, and the different production contents such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, several work lines are divided and professional production teams are organized to carry out production more effectively. During the busy farming season, workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers are mobilized to implement large-scale labor cooperation, and sometimes adopt "large-scale corps operations" to tackle urgent production tasks. June and July are the most tense months for farm work. Summer harvest, summer planting, and summer hoeing are all concentrated in this season. Once the sickle sounds, the wheat harvest cannot be delayed. Baodi County, which sent out the most laborers, completed the task in this way: the county has a total of 200,600 strong and weak laborers. In previous years, the task of harvesting less than 600,000 mu of wheat seemed to be a labor shortage. In 1959, because the area of wheat planting was expanded, 800,000 mu had to be harvested. However, the labor force was reduced by nearly a quarter, with 16,500 strong laborers working at the reservoir, and 26,730 laborers supporting urban and industrial construction. Under the circumstances of more wheat fields and less labor, the county "divided its troops into two routes." One route carried out labor such as summer field management, and the other route, with 112,000 laborers, simultaneously mobilized 61,000 "reinforcements" from workers, cadres, and students, forming an army of more than 170,000 wheat harvesters. After more than ten days of fighting, they completed the wheat harvesting task in a timely manner. Immediately afterward, without leaving the saddle and without stopping the horse, they drove the troops to the summer planting battle line and planted more late autumn crops than in previous years in a timely manner.

	The tool reform movement after communization has also undergone new development: the creativity of the broad masses of commune members has been fully brought into play; skilled craftsmen have been organized; and commune-run industries have provided a strong guarantee for the manufacture and promotion of new tools. The Shi'e Production Team of the Tangzi People's Commune in Miyun County, with more than 2,200 people, lives in the Shi'e Village, which is high in the mountains and deep in the water. The village only has one 16-zhang deep drinking water well. Every day, many people line up next to the well, using long ropes to tie willow cans to draw water. Due to the difficulty of using water, the whole village "views water as oil." After the establishment of the commune, a hand-cranked waterwheel was made, and the water situation was initially improved. However, the various undertakings of the commune are developing by leaps and bounds. Growing vegetables and paying attention to hygiene are urgent requirements of the commune members. Under the leadership of the brigade, the "capable people" of the whole village came to study this problem. After three modifications and five experiments, a deep well waterwheel driven by a pot-back machine was finally made by these ordinary blacksmiths, carpenters, and farmers. Then, they used the power of the pot-back machine to install a steel mill and a straw cutter next to the well. In this way, only eight people are needed to operate every day. In ten hours, 220 tons of water can be pumped, 3,000 catties of flour can be milled, and 5,000 catties of straw can be cut, which is enough for the whole village's people and animals to eat and drink, saving more than 12,000 labor days per year compared to using a hand-cranked waterwheel. Such examples are almost everywhere in the one hundred and eighty People's Communes sending out laborers. According to relevant statistics, on average, each People's Commune now has one or two agricultural tool repair factories with five or sixty people, and each production brigade has one or two agricultural tool repair factories with two or thirty people, including blacksmiths, fitters, turners, carpenters, and farriers. According to the needs of production and life, they are combined with the commune members who use agricultural tools, and they show their skills in reforming tools and promoting new tools. According to preliminary statistics from the twelve counties (districts) in Beijing that send out laborers, more than 200,000 improved agricultural tools and semi-mechanized agricultural tools were promoted in 1959. According to their use capacity, these innovative agricultural tools can save more than 30 million workdays compared to old agricultural tools, which is equivalent to the labor of 100,000 people per year.

	After communization, under the conditions of increased public accumulation in the communes, coupled with the support of the state, the number of tractors in these twenty-two counties (districts) has increased from 997 in 1958 to 1,526 in 1959. Other things like irrigation and drainage machinery, hydropower stations, automobiles, and horse-drawn farm implements have also increased significantly. These have also greatly saved labor.

	The above situation shows how rapidly productivity has developed in the twenty-two counties (districts) sending out laborers after the establishment of the People's Communes! The 200,000 laborers they sent to build the Miyun Reservoir are only a small part of the liberated productivity. More production potential excavated is used for: 1. intensive cultivation; 2. diversified management; 3. basic farmland construction; 4. supporting urban factories and mines.

		One Hundred and Eighty Large Rear Areas

	Two hundred thousand people, equivalent to the residents of dozens of small towns, how can they be provided with enough to eat, keep warm, have complete tools, and start construction immediately once they start work in a sparsely populated construction site? The laborers said proudly: "We have the People's Commune as a large rear area!"

	A few days before the start of construction, there was nothing on the construction site. Can construction start on schedule? Some people said that unless Zhuge Liang comes back to "borrow arrows with straw boats" again, otherwise, how can the living, eating, and necessities be prepared in a short time? However, within a few days, people, horses, and vehicles from one hundred and eighty People's Communes came to report all over the mountains and fields. Moreover, in a few days and nights, the necessary materials were prepared. To build sheds, if you can't buy reed mats for a while, the commune members will take out the kang mats from their homes and let their soldiers take them away first. To bring handcarts, commune-run woodworking factories rush to make them overnight... The materials they brought, just 710,000 reed mats, 240,000 bamboo poles, 750,000 catties of hemp, 80,000 handcarts, and more than 200,000 various tools, would be enough for 100 five-ton trucks to transport for more than two months. However, without purchasing agents or transportation teams, relying only on the laborers carrying them with them, such a large amount of materials was gathered at the construction site within a few days. In the blink of an eye, dozens of shed cities appeared on the river beach and in the mountain gullies.

	One hundred and eighty People's Communes are the one hundred and eighty large rear areas of the reservoir. In order to ensure that the reservoir project can proceed in a timely manner, these People's Communes not only temporarily paid for various materials worth a total of 9.22 million yuan, but also the meal expenses for the first three months of the laborers were raised by the communes. The tool repair for 200,000 people is a big problem. The communes sent 5,500 technical talents such as carpenters, blacksmiths, car repairers, and shed builders, so that small repairs do not leave the job position and major repairs do not take more than a day. The supply of barbers, baths, and daily necessities for so many laborers is a very thoughtful thing. The laborer detachments of each county also brought their own barbers, sewers, and shoemakers, and also opened shops and simple bathhouses. Whenever the reservoir construction site needs certain materials and the fundraising is not timely, the laborer organization sends a message back, and the commune immediately extends a helping hand. When carrying out large-scale tool reforms, raw materials are difficult to obtain, and many communes send scrap steel, scrap iron, and wood to manufacture the tools needed.

	At this construction site, many people have been laborers or led laborers in the past. They all feel that this time is very different from any previous time. First, the water conservancy projects built in the past were small in scale, and the laborers generally came from the directly benefiting areas. This time, the number of people is large, the area is large, and the scope of cooperation is wide. Some come from thousands of miles away, and more than 120,000 of them are from non-benefiting areas. Second, in the past, water conservancy was generally built during the gaps in farm work, and the time did not exceed four or five months at most. This time, the time is long, one to two years. Third, what is particularly prominent is that the laborers who came to build the Miyun Reservoir this time are more motivated and work at the reservoir construction site with more peace of mind than ever before. Some comrades who have been leading laborers to build water conservancy since liberation recalled the situation in various historical stages: in the mutual aid groups, the laborers were drawn by lottery. Although the state paid wages, they were in the construction site but their hearts were at home. Some people who were not very aware of the situation ran away. In the early stage of the primary cooperative, the production at home was settled, and the situation was much better, but when it came to family and work, they still could not rest assured. In the advanced cooperative period, the situation further improved. They were completely relieved of production matters, and what they were concerned about was the family's livelihood. A very hardworking laborer in Chaoyang District named Huo Kuishan secretly went home three times when building the Ming Tombs Reservoir, going late and returning early, to arrange life for his family. After communization, the situation is even more different. The laborers not only do not have to worry about production, but also do not have to worry about family life, because the commune takes care of everything.

	How did the People's Commune arrange the lives of the laborers?

	The commune records work points, and the state issues allowances. The state issues an allowance of 7 jiao per day to each standard worker. Those who work well, have high efficiency, and exceed the standard work are also given some rewards. Generally, after deducting food expenses, 70% of the allowance received by the laborers belongs to themselves, and 30% is handed over to the commune, and the commune records work points as usual. Some record points according to the labor force above the middle level, and some are rated by the reservoir construction site according to the labor situation, but generally they are equivalent to or slightly higher than their own labor force. In this way, it is guaranteed that the income of the laborers will not be reduced and can be increased.

	The commune takes care of all family life. Family members eat in the canteen, and no longer have to worry about fetching water, chopping firewood, or grinding flour. For some families that lack labor or do not participate in the canteen, the commune arranges special personnel to fetch water, deliver firewood, and take care of their lives. The commune's hospitals and maternity hospitals provide them with medical treatment and childbirth care when family members give birth or get sick. During the rainy season in 1959, many houses collapsed due to floods in some places. In some areas, mud and grass houses have to be plastered and repaired every year. The People's Commune organized a house repair team to give priority to the families of laborers.

	The People's Commune cares for the soldiers sent by itself in every possible way. When it is cold, it sends cotton clothes, cotton hats, and cotton gloves; during the rainy season, it sends rubber shoes and raincoats; during the season when vegetables are scarce, it sends the vegetables it has saved, and also sends gifts and art troupes during festivals.

		Keep the Immigrants Living in the County, the Commune is All One Family

	The reservoir area had to move 57 villages, 9,900 households, and more than 48,000 immigrants before storing water in 1959. How to mobilize for the big move of tens of thousands of people? How to move? How to resettle? Especially in the process of migration and resettlement, it is not a simple matter to stabilize the lives of the immigrants and not reduce their income. Originally, it was planned to resettle them in other counties. With the advent of the People's Commune movement, the situation changed. The leaders of the county and the people in the reservoir area and the resettlement area discussed it and immediately changed their minds, deciding to resettle all of them within the county and speed up the relocation, moving them to 104 villages near the reservoir area within six months.

	The People's Commune is like a rising red sun, shining brightly on the gold and silver treasures above and below the ground in the resettlement area, summoning people to exploit them. The original manpower of these communes was fully used, but more people were needed. People are treasures! The commune members in the resettlement area warmly welcomed the immigrants from the reservoir area to build a new socialist countryside with them. A few people had other ideas, thinking that the land was limited and life would be difficult with more people. But people did not agree, saying that their ideas were not right. With the People's Commune, the vision is still so short-sighted! The commune members vacated more comfortable houses to let the immigrants live temporarily before the new houses were built. The public canteen prepared for the increase in population, and the production team made overall arrangements in production, so that the new residents would have food to eat, houses to live in, and work to do as soon as they arrived. All People's Communes in the county uniformly transferred more than 500 large carts and more than 2,000 livestock to form a transportation team to help the reservoir area immigrants move. Land travel was too slow. Some people created the method of releasing rafts, going downstream. In this way, all the furniture of the immigrants, even firewood and sundries, were quickly transported to the new residence through mountain roads, highways, and rivers. The state issued a relocation fee of 150 yuan to each immigrant. The commune moved them for free, saving this batch of relocation fees. Except for 5% as a temporary subsidy for the immigrants, the remaining 95% was entrusted to the commune for unified control as a fund for building houses and purchasing utensils. 30,000 houses will be built before the end of 1960, and then all the immigrants can move to these new homes.

	Miyun County originally had 640,000 mu of cultivated land. The reservoir and construction land occupied 39%, leaving only 390,000 mu of cultivated land. According to the characteristics of more sideline occupations in the mountainous area, the county's Party organization led the People's Communes to organize the increased labor force and actively develop diversified economies such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. The income increased by these production undertakings made up for the loss of a large reduction in land. Although the total grain output was reduced, it still reached self-sufficiency in grain for the county (it was a grain-deficient county before 1958). The total income exceeded 1958 by 17.2%. Once the result of the final account was announced, the stone in people's hearts finally fell to the ground. They said: "The People's Commune is really a treasure. It only bloomed last year and it bears fruit this year. Things that could not be done in the past can be done now."

		Three Great Leaps Forward

	Relying on the power of the People's Communes, under the leadership of the Party, the twenty-two counties (districts) sending out laborers have achieved three great leaps forward: they have built such a large-scale comprehensive reservoir, production has not decreased, and they have achieved brilliant achievements; they have cultivated a labor force with high ideological awareness, organization, discipline, and technology.

	After the Miyun Reservoir controlled the Chao River and the Bai River, the Chao and Bai Rivers became beneficial rivers. In the event of a once-in-a-century flood of 8,910 cubic meters per second, the downstream flow will not exceed 1,000 cubic meters per second, so the 6 million mu of land downstream will no longer suffer from the flood of the Chao and Bai Rivers. Shortly after the reservoir controlled the flood during the flood season in 1959, it encountered a particularly large flood of 3,100 cubic meters per second. At that time, only 360 cubic meters per second of water was discharged downstream, so more than 1 million mu of fields in Jixian and Baodi counties in Hebei Province were spared from disaster. In Tongxian and Shunyi areas in Beijing, not only were the crops in the river滩 land preserved, but also the serious water accumulation could be quickly drained due to the lower water level of the Chao and Bai Rivers, reducing the disaster of waterlogging in these areas. Now the People's Communes along the Chao and Bai Rivers are building irrigation channels one after another, planning to silt the river滩 land. These two items alone can increase 1 million mu of cultivated land and turn 4 million mu of dry land into water land. With the water source of the reservoir, after the Jingmi and Jingjin Canals are built in the future, Tianjin, which is seriously short of water, and Beijing, which is not rich in water sources, will generally add 28.1 cubic meters per second of industrial water from here. In addition, there are also the benefits of power generation and aquaculture.

	Will building such a large reservoir and using so much labor affect the production of the People's Communes? According to statistics from the competent departments of Hebei Province and Beijing, the total rural output value of the twenty-two counties (districts) sending out laborers in 1959 was more than 183 million yuan, an increase of 25% compared to the great leap forward of 1958; the average net income per person was 51 yuan, an increase of more than 20% compared to 1958; the total value of commune accumulation has reached more than 90 million yuan, which is more than double that of 1958. The following situation in several areas can more clearly show how broad prospects the establishment of the People's Communes has opened up for the development of production. In Baodi County, which suffers from disasters for years at the "end of the nine rivers," although the waterlogging was serious in 1959, due to the flood control of the Miyun Reservoir and the commune members making great efforts on the "eight-character constitution" of agricultural production, the low-yield appearance of previous years has begun to change. The total grain output increased by 88% compared to 1958, and it jumped from a grain-deficient county to a grain-surplus county. Among the 866 production teams in the county, the net income of 577 teams increased by more than 30% compared to 1958, including 260 teams with an increase of 30% to 50%, 216 teams with an increase of 50% to 100%, and 101 teams with an increase of more than 100%. The average net income per person in each commune was 75 yuan, an increase of 1.34 times compared to 32 yuan per person in 1958. In addition, more than 8 million yuan of public accumulation funds and public welfare funds were withdrawn, which also increased by more than five times compared to 1958. Zunhua County, a non-benefiting area, also encountered a fairly serious disaster in 1959, but the increase in production was also very large. Under the circumstances of transferring nearly one-tenth of the labor force to participate in the reservoir construction, the average net income per person also increased from 71.4 yuan in 1958 to 78.6 yuan in 1959. The Jianming People's Commune led by the famous "poor stick" 社 (poor people's commune) of this county, Wang Guofan, has a total of 8,018 various laborers, and 1,200 laborers participated in the construction of the Miyun Reservoir. The total income situation in the past three years is as follows: 1.87 million yuan in 1957, 2.58 million yuan in 1958, and jumped to 3.35 million yuan in 1959, an increase of 29.8% in 1959 compared to 1958. The Chengguan People's Commune in Miyun County, where the reservoir is located, developed production under another situation. This commune is located at the confluence of the Chao and Bai Rivers. Although it was spared from the invasion of floods in 1959, the land occupied by the reservoir accounted for nearly half of the commune's cultivated land. Under this situation, how can the income level of 1958 be maintained? They brought into play the superiority of the People's Commune "one big and two public," organizing the labor force remaining due to the occupation of land and the newly liberated labor force, forming various professional teams, running factories, mining stones, cultivating intensively, developing animal husbandry and fruit tree production, and prospering diversified economies, thereby creating a great miracle: the grain yield per mu in 1959 increased by 10% compared to 1958, and the total income can still exceed 1958 by 14%.

	The one hundred and eighty People's Communes sending out laborers also received an "unexpected" harvest: their 200,000 children sent out "changed!" "They are more aware and look like cadres, and have become a labor force with organization, discipline, and technology!"

	With the leadership and education of the Party, this large collective of 200,000 people has become a revolutionary melting pot and a communist university. They learn culture, practice technology, establish clubs, organize amateur theater troupes, hold ideological debates, and carry out comparison and competition activities... The life on the construction site is full of enthusiasm. "Do we need to build a reservoir? Who will build the reservoir? How to build the reservoir?" were the topics initially debated by the laborers. At the conference to accuse the disasters of the Chao and Bai Rivers, the evil faces of the reactionary ruling class, the root of the disasters of the Chao and Bai Rivers, were exposed. The past disasters and the present happiness formed a sharp contrast. At the conference, how many people shed tears of excitement! A laborer named Song Dahai (poor peasant) from the Ba County detachment felt that it was "not profitable" when he first came to the reservoir construction site to work, and he was a little slippery when he worked. The laborers who worked with him calculated two accounts with him using the facts of the disasters suffered by the county in the past: the first account, in 1939 before liberation, there was no one to take care of the disaster that year, and they ate garlic braids and sorghum grass; in 1954 after liberation, there was also a disaster, but the people of the whole county, including Song Dahai, ate the relief grain transferred by the Party and the state from 24 provinces across the country, and did not go hungry. Can this be calculated with the word "profit"? Song Dahai was educated by this, and he became aware and became an activist in this detachment. He was always at the forefront in the most difficult battles.

	In this way, they spent the snowy winter of 1958 in a fiery battle. When the warm spring blossoms came in 1959, they brought the achievements of technological innovation and formed new partners with more than 4,000 construction machines transferred by the state, and became the masters of driving the machines, racing against the flood.

	How powerful are the machines when they are used by people who have mastered their own destiny! The earth-moving efficiency of a belt conveyor is equal to that of more than 400 people carrying earth to the dam. The earth-compacting efficiency of a tamping machine is equal to that of more than 1,000 people sweating and tamping. Once the 200,000 people are linked to these modern construction machines, the entire project is like having wings, and the work efficiency rises rapidly: the average daily damming volume in March was more than 51,000 cubic meters, it rose to more than 66,000 cubic meters in April, and it rose sharply to nearly 76,000 cubic meters in May. After June, the flood season came early, and people fought fiercely with the flood. It was them, these people with increasingly improved political awareness, who did not hesitate to use their bodies to form a 2,300-meter-long "water wall" to transport earth and build embankments in the water. If the carts could not be pushed, they carried mud on their backs. If the baskets could not be carried, they used grass bags of mud. The water rose and the embankment rose. In twelve days and nights, they built a dam-front cofferdam on time, winning the construction time for the dam. When the flood exceeded the cofferdam and went straight to the Bai River Dam, it was also them, and more than 10,000 officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who came to support them, who built a temporary section of clay inclined wall three meters wide in a four-day and night assault battle, raising it to a flood-blocking height of 143 meters above sea level at a speed of four meters per day,

    人民公社显神威　长城脚下制孽龙
    河北、北京地区一百八十个人民公社修建密云水库的调查报告
    中共北京市委密云水库调查组
              公社时代的奇迹
    两条“孽龙”——潮河和白河，在很短时间内被征服了。这件事，充分反映出中国共产党领导下的中国人民的力量，也显示了毛泽东思想光芒照耀下的新生的人民公社的威力。
    这两条“孽龙”，在华北的东北部，肆虐千百年了。多少人因它流离失所，家破人亡！可是，一进入人民公社时代，它不能再逞凶了！附近二十二个县（区）的一百八十个人民公社，组织起二十万社员的征服潮白河大军，在党的统一领导指挥下，和“孽龙”展开战斗，历时不到一年，就把它制服在万里长城脚下，顺驯地为人民服务了。
    这就是位置在首都东北角上的密云水库。
    这个水库的形状好像一只大螃蟹。右爪箝着发源于丰宁县的潮河，左爪箝着发源于张北县的白河。咆哮着的汹涌河水，在这里被吞没，被“消化”，最后终于听从人们的命令，从为它们安排好的几个隧洞中泄出滚滚清流，从塘沽附近入渤海。从此，潮白河水患得到根治，四百万亩旱地将变成良田，京津两大城市将得到二十八秒立方米的工业用水，使生活在潮白河流域的四百万人民和北京、天津两大城市得到了巨大的水利效益。
    水库工程由潮河、白河两大主坝、九个副坝和廊道、隧洞、电站、溢洪道等建筑物组成。坝顶高程为海拔一百六十米。在达到设计最高水位一百五十七点五米的时候，它的容水量为四十一亿立方米，水面面积为二百平方公里，略小于太湖，而大于西湖。主坝和副坝共长五千五百米，坝的总填筑量有二千零七十点五万立方米，连开挖和附属工程在内，土石方工作总量达三千七百万立方米。和我国已经建成的几个著名水库比较，它的土坝工程量约为官厅水库的二十倍，南湾水库的六倍，大伙房水库的二倍，岗南水库的两倍，是我国目前已经拦洪的水库中工程量最大的大型综合水库。修建这样一座水库，在通常情况下，一般要一两年准备时间和四五年的施工期。可是，人民公社一出现，人们就凭借着它所迸发出来的巨大威力，冲破常规，在确保工程质量的前提下，为大型工程建设创造了高速度的范例。它在1958年9月动工，1959年7月拦洪，预计1960年汛前竣工。就是说，十个月拦洪，当年受到效益，不到两年时间全部建成。这是水库修建史上的一大奇迹。
    修建密云水库，根治潮白河，对潮白河流域的四百万人民来说，是一件多么激动人心的事啊！消息传出以后，整个潮白河流域沸腾起来了。要求参加水库建设的申请书，像雪片一样飞向各人民公社。社员们这种热情是完全可以理解的。旧社会里，他们受尽“孽龙”虐害，做梦也不敢想到修水库的事。现在，有了党的领导，有了人民公社这个大后方作依托，一个伟大的愿望就要实现了。党一声号召，受益的和非受益的一百八十个人民公社，十天左右，就派出了最棒的小伙子，最优秀的干部，带着家乡父老“坚决把水堵住”、“为公社争光”的嘱咐，背着吃的、住的和劳动用的各式器具，浩浩荡荡地向水库工地出发了。两个多月后，二十万修库大军如期到达工地。
    二十万人，是一个不寻常的数字，它相当于出民工的二十二个县（区）劳动力总数的十分之一左右；他们住的、吃的和用的，即使由北京整个市场来供应，一时也供应不及。而依靠这二十万人生活的没有劳动能力的老人和小孩，又何止五十万；同时，时间不是短暂的，要一年到二年。怎样能使他们长期安心参加水库的建设呢？要解决这些问题，在过去是难以设想的。但是，人民公社刚一成立，就办下了这件大事。
        二十万劳动力是怎样挖掘出来的
    人民公社是怎样解决这些问题的呢？
    民工开始出征的时候，有些好心人担心：“公社成立头一年，就抽出这么多人去修水库，对公社的生产会有影响吧？”这种忧虑，在通常情况下，是可以理解的，但是他们没有看到人民公社的优越性。因为，公社化以后，首先从家务劳动中解放了；还有，人们的思想觉悟提高了；生产组织改进了；生产工具改革了，这些，都大大增进了生产力。
    以前，一个五口之家，差不多都有一个劳动力忙于家务。公社化以后，做饭、衣着、抚养小孩等，基本上由公社办的食堂、托儿所和缝纫组等集体福利组织所代替，他们转而分别从事公社的生产性劳动或服务性劳动。出民工的丰台区中苏友好人民公社，在公社化以前，折合有二千九百六十六人从事家务劳动，现在变化为：仍从事个体家务劳动的六百四十五人，从事公社服务劳动的六百六十九人，有一千六百五十二人则从事公社的生产劳动。平谷县城关人民公社熊耳营第二生产中队公社化前有二十二人从事家务劳动，现在全部参加公社劳动，六人是炊事员，三人是保育员，二人是缝纫员，另外十一人则全部从事公社的生产劳动。就是说，过去从事消费性劳动的一百人中，公社化以后，在靠近大城市的石景山中苏友好人民公社已有五十六人转化为从事生产性的劳动。在接近山区的熊耳营第二生产中队则有五十人转化为从事生产性的劳动。据出民工的二十二个县（区）不很精确的统计，公社化前，折合有一百一十一万七千九百九十四人从事家务劳动，公社化后，除26％的人仍从事个体家务劳动外，21％的人从事公社服务性劳动，53％的人从事公社生产性劳动。即八十二万余人从家务劳动中解放出来以后，有二十三万余人参加了公社的服务性劳动，有五十九万余人参加了公社的生产性劳动。直接参加公社生产劳动的人数，几乎相当于这二十二个县（区）派出民工总数的三倍。
    摆脱了以繁琐的个体劳动为特点的家务劳动的人们，心情舒畅，精神愉快，能够集中精力进行创造性的劳动。宝坻支队女民工李秀荣，全家五口人，公社化以前，半参加生产，半操持家务。那时，天未亮就起床做早饭，中午回家作饭、洗锅、刷碗，不能歇晌，晚上睡的比别人晚，因此，精神疲累，生产效率不高。遇有缝补衣服鞋袜等等，就要歇工，隔十天左右还要歇工推一天磨。一年只能记上九百个工分；公社化后，担任工地炊事员，一身无牵挂，工作挺积极，和另外三个炊事员做二百多个民工的饭。公社根据她在水库劳动的情况，1959年给她记了一千八百个工分。她每月还可以在水库所发津贴中，积蓄十元左右。密云支队著名的十姊妹突击队领导人王建华，全家十五口人，本人是个好劳动力，干活总是挣头等工分。但是，公社化前，不能出全勤，家里的针线活全靠她和她母亲做。公社化后，祖母在家养老，四个小侄儿进了小学和幼儿园，十个大人都担任了力所能及的劳动，母亲在缝纫组作活，她本人在水库工地作出了出色的成绩，现在已是一位光荣的共产党员了。从这两个普通人及其家庭的变化中，可以看到，蕴藏在她们身上的劳动潜力，在有了人民公社的条件下，得到了多么大的发挥！
    从统一调配劳动力方面挖出的潜力也很惊人。在这一百八十个人民公社里，平时，根据生产任务、社员特长和身体的强弱，按农林牧副渔等不同的生产内容，划分若干作业线，组织专业生产队，更有成效地进行生产；在农忙季节，工农商学兵总动员，实行劳动力大协作，有时采用“大兵团作战”方式，突击紧迫的生产任务。6、7月农活最紧张，夏收、夏种、夏锄都集中在这个季节，镰刀一响，麦收刻不容缓。出民工最多的宝坻县，是这样完成任务的：全县共有强弱劳动力二十万零六千多人，往年收割麦子的任务不到六十万亩，还显得劳动力紧张，1959年因为种麦面积扩大了，要收割八十万亩，可是劳动力减少将近四分之一，有一万六千五百个强劳动力在水库劳动，还有二万六千七百三十个劳动力支援城市和工业建设。在麦田多、劳动力少的情况下，全县“兵分两路”，一路进行夏田管理等劳动，一路带了十一万二千个劳动力，同时在工人、干部、学生中调集了六万一千名“援军”，组成了十七万多人的收麦大军，经过十多天的战斗，及时完成了收麦任务。紧接着人不离鞍，马不停蹄，又把人马开到夏种战线上，及时种上了比往年更多的晚秋作物。
    公社化后的工具改革运动也有了新的发展：广大社员群众的创造性得到充分发挥；能工巧匠组织起来了，社办工业为新工具的制造和推广提供了有力的保证。有二千二百多人口的密云县塘子人民公社石娥生产队，他们住的石娥村，山高水深，全村只有一眼十六丈深的饮水井，每天总有很多人在井旁排队，用长绳系着柳条罐拉水。由于用水困难，全村“视水如油”。公社成立后，制了一台手摇水车，用水情况得到初步改善。但是公社的各项事业都在飞跃发展。种菜呀，讲卫生呀，是社员们迫切的要求。在大队领导下，全村的“能人”都来研究这个问题。经过三次改装，五次试验，一台用锅驼机带动的深井水车，终于被这些普通的铁匠、木匠和庄稼汉们制成了。接着，他们又利用锅驼机的动力，在井旁安装了钢磨、铡草机。这样，每天只需八人操作，在十小时内，即可抽水二百二十吨，磨面三千斤，铡草五千斤，足够全村人、畜饮食，比用手摇水车全年可省一万二千多个劳动工日。像这样的事例，在出民工的一百八十个人民公社中，几乎到处都是。据有关方面统计，现在平均每个人民公社都有一、两个五、六十人的农具修造厂，平均每个生产大队有一个或两个共二、三十人的农具修理厂，其中有锻工、钳工、车工、木工、钉掌工，他们按照生产上、生活上的需要，和使用农具的社员结合一起，在改革工具和推广新工具方面大显身手。据北京市出民工的十二个县（区）初步统计，在1959年内，就推广了二十余万件改良农具和半机械化农具。这些革新过的农具，按其使用能力，可以比旧农具节省三千多万个工日，等于十万人一年的劳动量。
    公社化后，在公社公共积累增加的条件下，加上国家的支持，这二十二个县（区）的拖拉机已由1958年的九百九十七台增长到1959年的一千五百二十六台，其他像排灌机械、水电站、汽车、马拉农具等也都有很大增长。这些也都大大地节省了劳动力。
    以上情况说明，出民工的二十二个县（区），在成立了人民公社以后，生产力得到了多么迅速的发展！它们派出修建密云水库的二十万劳动力，只是在所解放出来的生产力中一小部分而已；挖出的更多的生产潜力还用于：一、精耕细作；二、多种经营；三、农田基本建设；四、支援城市厂矿企业。
            一百八十个大后方
    二十万人，相当于几十个小城镇的居民，在一片人烟稀少的工地上，一旦开工，吃得饱，住得暖，工具齐全，立时动手施工，这是怎样解决的呢？民工们自豪地说：“我们有人民公社做大后方啊！”
    开工前几天，工地上还什么都没有。能否按期开工？有人说，除非诸葛亮再来一次“草船借箭”，否则住的、吃的、用的短时间内哪能备齐呀？可是，没过几天，来自一百八十个人民公社的人儿、马儿、车儿，就漫山遍野地来报到了。而且几个昼夜，就把所需物资准备好了。要搭工棚，一时买不到苇席，社员们就把家里的炕席揭出来，让自己的子弟兵先带走。要带手推车，社办木工厂连夜赶制……。他们带来的物资，光是七十一万片苇席，二十四万根竹竿，七十五万斤麻，八万辆手推车，二十多万件各式工具，就够一百辆五吨大卡车运两个多月。可是，用不着采购员，也不用运输队，只依靠民工们的随身携带，几天之内，这样庞大的物资，就都齐集工地了。河滩上，山沟里，转眼之间出现了几十个工棚城市。
    一百八十个人民公社，就是水库的一百八十个大后方。为了使水库工程能够及时进行，这些人民公社不但临时垫支了总值达九百二十二万元的各项物资，民工们最初三个月的饭费，也是各公社筹垫的。二十万人的工具修理是个大问题，公社派来了五千五百名木工、铁匠、修车工、棚匠等技术人才，作到了小修不离岗位，大修不隔日。这么多民工的理发、洗澡、生活资料的供应，是一件很费心思的事情，每个县的民工支队也都带来了自己的理发师、缝纫员、修鞋匠，还办起了商店和简易浴池。每当水库工地需要某种物资而筹措不及时，民工组织上捎回一句话，公社就立即伸出支援的手。大搞工具改革时，原材料发生困难，很多公社送来了废钢、废铁和木料，制造了所需要的工具。
    在这个工地上，不少人过去曾经当过民工，或者带过民工。他们都感到，这次和过去任何一次都大不相同。第一，过去修的水利工程，规模小，民工一般来自直接受益区，这次人数多，区域大，协作范围广，有远从千里以外来的，其中有十二万多人是来自非受益区；第二，过去一般是农事空隙修水利，时间最多不超过四五个月，这次时间长，一年到两年；第三，特别突出的，是这次来修密云水库的民工，比以往任何一次都干劲大，安心在水库工地劳动。有些从解放以来就一直带民工兴修水利的同志，回忆了各个历史阶段的情况：在互助组时，民工是抽签来的，虽然国家发工资，但是他们身在工地心在家，一些觉悟不高的人，开了小差。到了初级社时期，家里生产有了着落，情况好多了，但一提到家庭和活计，还是不能安心。高级社时期，情况进一步好转，生产上的事完全放心，所惦念的，就是家庭的生活问题。朝阳区有个劳动很出色的民工叫霍奎山，他在修建十三陵水库时，曾三次悄悄回家，晚去早回，给家里安排生活。公社化后，情况更加不同了，民工不但不要操心生产，连家庭生活也不必耽心了，因为公社全管起来了。
    人民公社是怎样安排民工生活的？
    公社记工分，国家发津贴。国家给每个标准工每天发七角钱的津贴。劳动好，工效高，超过标准工的，还给予一部分奖励。民工得到的津贴费，一般地在扣除伙食费以后，70％归自己，30％交公社，公社则照常记工分。记工分的办法，有的按中等以上的劳动力记分，有的由水库工地根据劳动情况评分，但一般都相当或略高于本人的劳动力。这样，就保证了民工收入不减少，并且可以有所增加。
    家里生活公社全部管。家属在食堂吃饭，不用再为挑水、打柴、磨面分心。有些缺乏劳动力或没有参加食堂的家庭，公社安排了专人，给他们挑水送柴，照料生活。家属生育、患病，社的医院、产院就地给她们医疗、接生。1959年雨季，有些地方因水灾房子坍塌很多，有些地区泥草屋要年年抹泥和修理，人民公社组织了修房专业队，优先照顾民工的家庭。
    人民公社对于自己派来的子弟兵，关怀无微不至。天寒，送来棉衣、棉帽、棉手套；雨季，送来胶鞋、雨衣；缺菜的季节，送来自己节省下的蔬菜，逢年过节还送来礼品，派来文工团。
      留得移民本县住，公社全是一家人
    库区要在1959年蓄水前迁走五十七个村庄、九千九百户、四万八千多名移民。几万人大搬家，如何动员？如何搬？如何安置？特别是在迁移安置过程中，使移民生活安定，不减少收入，是一件很不简单的事情。原计划分别安置在外县。人民公社运动一来，形势不同了，县的领导上和库区、安置区的人民一商量，立刻改变主意，确定全部安置在本县以内，并且加快搬家速度，在六个月内就迁移到库区附近一百零四个村庄去。
    人民公社像刚升起的一轮红日，把安置区地上地下的金银财宝照得雪亮，召唤着人们去开采。这些公社原有的人力全使上了，但还要人，人就是财宝啊！安置区的社员们，热烈地欢迎库区移民，来同他们一起建设社会主义的新农村。少数人另有想法，认为土地有限，人多了日子不好过。但是人们不赞成，说他们的想法不对头，有了人民公社，眼光还这样短浅！社员们腾出比较舒适的房屋，让移民在新房没盖好前暂住，公共食堂作好增加人口的准备，生产队在生产上作了统筹安排，让新居民一来，立刻就有饭吃，有房住，有活干。全县各人民公社，统一抽调了五百多辆大车，二千多头牲口，组成运输队，帮助库区移民搬家。陆行太慢，有人创造了放木筏的办法，顺流而下，这样，移民的全部家具以至柴草什物，都很快地通过山路、公路和河道，运到了新的住地。国家给每个移民发一百五十元迁移费，公社代搬家，迁移不花钱，省下的这批迁移费，除以5％作为移民的临时补助外，下余95％，都委托公社统一掌握，作为修盖住宅和添置用具的基金。在1960年底以前建房三万间，那时全部移民就都可以搬到这些新居里去了。
    密云全县原有耕地六十四万亩，水库和建设用地占去了39％，只剩下三十九万亩耕地了。根据山区副业多的特点，县的党组织领导各人民公社，把增加的劳动力组织起来，积极发展农林牧副渔多种经济。这些生产事业所增加的收入，弥补了土地大量减少的损失，粮食总产量虽有减少，但仍然达到全县粮食自给（1958年以前是缺粮县），总收入超过1958年17．2％。决算的结果一揭晓，搁在人们心里的石头最后落了地。他们说：“人民公社真是宝，去年才开花，今年就结果；过去办不到的事，现在办到了。”
                三个大跃进
    出民工的二十二个县（区），凭借人民公社的威力，在党的领导下，取得了三个大跃进：修建了这样一座大型综合水库，生产没有降低，并且获得了辉煌的成就；培养出一支具有较高思想觉悟的，有组织、有纪律、有技术的劳动队伍。
    密云水库把潮河和白河控制起来以后，潮白河就变成益河了。遇有百年一遇的八千九百一十秒立方米洪水时，下泄流量将不超过一千秒立方米，下游六百万亩土地因此不再遭受潮白河洪水的危害。水库在1959年汛期拦洪后不久，曾遭遇到三千一百秒立方米特大洪水的考验，那时只向下游泄出三百六十秒立方米的水，河北省境内的蓟县、宝坻等县一百万亩以上的田地，因此免除灾害。北京市境内的通县、顺义一带，不但保全了河滩地的庄稼，由于潮白河水位较低，严重的积水能够迅速得到排泄，减轻了这些地区内涝的灾害。现在潮白河沿岸各人民公社正在纷纷修整灌溉渠道，计划淤漫河滩地。光这两项，将可增加一百万亩耕地，并变四百万亩旱田为水地。有了水库的水源，将来京密、京津运河修建后，严重缺水的天津和水源也不丰富的北京，在一般情况下，将从这里添得二十八点一秒立方米的工业用水。此外还有发电、水产之利。
    修建这样大型的水库，使用这样多的劳动力，会不会影响人民公社的生产呢？据河北省、北京市的主管部门统计，出民工的二十二个县（区），1959年的农村总产值为十八万三千多万元，比大跃进的1958年增长25％；平均每人的纯收入为五十一元，比1958年增加20％多；公社积累总值已达九千多万元，相当于1958年的一倍还多。从下面几个地区的情况可以更清楚地看出，人民公社的建立，为生产的发展开辟了多么广阔的前途。在“九河下梢”连年遭灾的宝坻县，1959年虽然内涝严重，由于密云水库的拦洪，以及社员们在农业生产“八字宪法”上大作文章，历年来的低产面貌已在开始改变，粮食总产量比1958年增加88％，由缺粮县一跃而为余粮县。全县八百六十六个生产队当中，有五百七十七个队的纯收入比1958年增加三成以上，其中增加三成到五成的有二百六十个队，五成到一倍的有二百一十六个队，一倍以上的有一百零一个队，各公社平均每人纯收入七十五元，比1958年每人三十二元提高了一点三四倍。另外还提存了八百多万元的公积金和公益金，也比1958年增长了五倍多。非受益区的遵化县，1959年虽遇到相当严重的灾荒，但生产增长的幅度也很大，在调出将近十分之一劳动力参加水库建设的情况下，平均每人的纯收入也由1958年的七十一点四元增到1959年的七十八点六元。这个县著名的所谓穷棒子社——王国藩领导的建明人民公社，共有各种劳动力八千零十八人，有一千二百个劳动力参加密云水库的建设。最近三年来的总收入情况如下：1957年一百八十七万元，1958年二百五十八万元，1959年跃为三百三十五万元，1959年比1958年增长29．8％。水库的所在地——密云县城关人民公社，是在另外一种情况下发展生产的。这个公社位于潮白河汇流处。1959年虽然免除了水灾的侵袭，但水库占去的土地将近全社耕地的一半。在这种情况下，怎样才能保持住1958年的收入水平呢？他们发挥了人民公社“一大二公”的优越性，把因为占地而剩余的劳动力和新解放出来的劳动力组织起来，组成各种专业队，办工厂，采矿石，精耕细作，发展畜牧、果树生产，繁荣了多种经济，从而创造出伟大的奇迹：1959年粮食亩产量比1958年增加一成，总收入仍可超过1958年的14％。
    出民工的一百八十个人民公社，还得到了一个“意外”的收获：它们派出来的二十万子弟，在参加了一年多的大工程建设以后，“变了！”“觉悟高了，像个干部样样了，成为一支有组织、有纪律、有技术的劳动队伍了！”
    有了党的领导和教育，这二十万人的大集体，成为一个革命大熔炉，一所共产主义大学。他们学文化，练技术，成立俱乐部，组织业余剧团，举办思想辩论会，开展评比竞赛活动……工地生活热劲冲天。“要不要修水库？谁来修水库？怎样修水库？”是民工们最初展开辩论的题目。在控诉潮白河祸害的大会上，潮白河的祸根——反动统治阶级的凶恶面貌揭露出来了。以往的灾难，现在的幸福，形成了强烈的对比，在会上，多少人洒下了激动的泪水啊！霸县支队有个叫宋大海的民工（贫农），开始来水库工地劳动时，嫌“不挣钱”，干起活来有点滑。和他在一起干活的民工，用本县过去受灾的事实和他算了两笔账：第一笔，解放前的1939年，那年遭灾没人管，吃蒜辫子、高粮毛子；解放后的1954年，也遭了灾，但是全县人民包括宋大海在内，却吃到党和国家从全国二十四个省调来的救济粮，没挨一顿饿，这难道可以用“挣钱”两字来计算吗？宋大海受了这番教育，觉悟了，成为这个支队的一个积极分子，在最艰难的战斗中，他都干在前头。
    就这样，他们在火热的战斗中，度过了1958年冰天雪地的冬季，当1959年春暖花开的时候，又带着技术革新的成就，同国家先后调来的四千多台施工机械结成了新的伙伴，并且成为驾驭机械的主人，和洪水竞走。
    机械，由掌握了自己命运的人们来使唤，有多大的威力啊！一台皮带运输机，运土效率等于四百多个挑土上坝的人，一台夯板机，夯地效率等于一千多个汗流浃背打夯的人。二十万人一经和这些近代施工机械联结起来，整个工程就像长了翅膀，工效飞速上升：3月份平均日上坝量五万一千多立方米，4月份上长到六万六千多立方米，5月份又剧长到近七万六千立方米。6月份以后，汛期提前到来，人和洪水展开了激烈的斗争，是他们，这些政治觉悟日益提高的人们，毫不犹豫地用人身连成了二千三百多米长的“水墙”，在水中运土筑堰。小车推不动，用背背泥，篮子挑不出，就用草包泥，水涨堰高，十二个昼夜，按时修成了一条坝前围堰，赢得了大坝的修筑时间。在洪水超过围堰直奔白河大坝的时候，也是他们，还有前来支援的一万多名解放军官兵们，在四个日日夜夜的突击战中，日长四米，比计划提前一天修起了三米宽的粘土斜墙临时断面，使它飞速达到海拔一百四十三米的拦洪高程，让洪水在坝前空自咆哮。接着，滔滔狂浪转过头来猛袭潮河大坝，正在为大坝抢砌护坡石的民工们，也完全是在水中作业，时而水漫过了砌坡线，时而砌坡线又超过了水位，经过六昼夜战斗，人终于赛过了水，走在水的前面……。
    就在这样一个大熔炉里，在党的教育下，通过各个工程战役的锻炼，大机械施工的影响，农民中的一些狭隘、守旧的思想和观点，开始渐渐地被集体主义思想所代替，许多人更少想到自己，更多地关心着工程进度、工程质量和集体的荣誉。在一年多中，先后有八万多人获得了先进生产者和先进工作者的称号，五千多名普通农民成为干部，五千多名优秀分子分别参加了共产党和共青团，五千七百多人被培训成拖拉机手、汽车司机、测量员等三十九个工种的技工，近万人摘掉了文盲帽子，五万多人成为组织文艺、体育等活动的骨干分子，所有的民工也都懂得了很多修水库的知识，普遍能够鉴别粘土、砂料的质量。让我们为这些同志们高兴吧！徐路，宝坻县的贫农，解放前的乞丐，现在是出色的皮带运输机技工，他在三天内学会了在运输机上独立工作；吴振和，房山县的普通社员，现在掌握了全套混凝土工程技术；王悦，来自密云县的民工，现在是工地上著名的风钻手……。不少县（区）的民工支队现在都已有了各种工种的人材，他们自豪地说：“除了还缺设计师和开火车的司机以外，只要有图纸，一般的小型水库工程，我们就敢包下来。”事实上，他们很多人已成为治水的骨干，现在星罗棋布地分布在河北省、北京市中小型水库上的治水队伍，很大一部分就是以他们为骨干组成的。
    人民公社参加大型工程建设的一个范例
    这个水库的修建工程，是国家举办，公社参加，土洋并举，两条腿走路，因此争得了高速度。
    水利电力部和河北省、北京市的领导机关，联合组成水库修建总指挥部。国家出物资、机械，出技术力量，出工程费用，河北省、北京市二十二个县（区）所属一百八十个人民公社，组织大协作，按照水库工程的需要提供民工。民工在水库劳动，公社照常记工分，国家给民工另发生活津贴。民工所需的一切物资，也由各有关人民公社负责筹集，国家随后折价偿还。这样做的结果，国家节省了投资，争得了高速度；人民公社办成了自己独力办不到的大事；社员收入不减少，家庭生活有安排，还参加了国家建设，开阔了眼界，提高了觉悟，增长了知识，学得了技术。所有这一切，只有在党的领导和有了人民公社的条件下才能办得到。
    这种建设方法还表明：目前人民公社除有社办企业、几个社的联办企业和县联社举办的企业外，还可以在一定条件下，在更广阔的范围内，组织大协作，参加国家举办的属于全民所有制的大型工程。密云水库的建设经验，为人民公社参加国家的大型工程建设创立了范例，也为我国高速度进行社会主义建设提供了一种重要的组织形式。这种组织形式，对于鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地进行社会主义建设是有益的，对于人民公社由集体所有制向全民所有制过渡也是有益的。
