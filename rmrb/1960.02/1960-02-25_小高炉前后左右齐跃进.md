    Small Blast Furnaces Leap Forward in All Directions
    Rong County Vigorously Carries Out Mine Technical Transformation

     Grasp Ore
    (Reported by this newspaper) Rong County, Sichuan Province, has been vigorously improving its mines, with daily ore production gradually increasing from more than 400 tons to more than 1,300 tons, and the sand content decreasing from 40% to 10%. This has ensured that the blast furnaces are well-fed, and daily pig iron production has gradually increased from more than 50 tons to more than 120 tons.
    Initially, Rong County's ore production adopted a "sparrow warfare" approach of mining everywhere, resulting in low ore grade, dispersed mines, and difficult transportation. Under these circumstances, some cadres developed the idea of ​​making the blast furnaces subordinate to ore production, smelting as much iron as there was ore. In order to reverse this situation, the county party committee repeatedly pointed out to the responsible cadres of various factories that mine work must be subordinate to blast furnace production, organize active balance, ensure that the blast furnaces are well-fed, and continuously improve the level of pig iron production. After the ideological problems of the leading cadres were resolved, the factories universally organized the masses to conduct debates, so that all employees established the idea of ​​"determining materials based on production." On this basis, the county party committee vigorously grasped mine transformation, sending two county party committee secretaries to the front line of production to strengthen leadership, first organizing exploration teams and tunneling professional teams to conduct a comprehensive survey of the mines. The main focus was on the main mines with abundant, high-quality, and easily transportable mineral resources, and then vigorously carried out tunneling to speed up preparation work, and then gradually shorten the battle lines. This not only ensured the increase in ore production and grade, but also ensured that there were sufficient working faces.
    While gradually establishing bases, mines have universally promoted advanced mining experiences such as deep groove deep hole blasting, large step operations, and hand-held drilling, which have increased mining efficiency by an average of more than one time.
    In terms of ore transportation, the consolidation and improvement of "one network and five transformations" was accelerated, and the amount of transportation was greatly increased. Now, the county's ore production not only ensures that the blast furnaces are well-fed, but also has more than five days of reserves.
    Daxian Prefecture Rushes to Transport Iron by Both Land and Water

 Grasp Transportation
    (Reported by this newspaper) The iron transport workers of Daxian Prefecture, Sichuan Province, overcame the two weaknesses of dry water and short-distance collection and transportation, and transferred a large amount of high-quality iron to ensure steel production. In the first half of February, the area shipped (including transshipment) more than 20,000 tons of pig iron to Chongqing.
    In the tense battle to transport iron and ensure steel production, 85% of the cadres in the prefecture went to the front line of iron transfer. Party committee secretaries at all levels personally took charge, focusing on weak links. The prefectural transportation headquarters distributed the transfer plan to the lines on a daily and ten-day basis, contracted by section, and completed within a time limit. Xuanhan County organized 23,400 people, 300 wooden boats, 77 flatbed trucks and frame carts to rush short-distance transportation. The prefecture organized a large army of more than 3,000 people to dredge rivers, and launched a large-scale movement to resist drought and dredge the river with the people's communes along the river. After a short period of concentrated effort, the main shoals have been basically cleared. Pig iron that had been unloaded midway in the past due to dry water is now being transferred and shipped out.
    In order to give full play to the potential of existing transportation tools, various counties have strengthened the unified dispatch of vehicles and ships, promoted double-shift operation of automobiles with trailers, night sailing of wooden boats, vigorously promoted double-wing boats and wind sailing, so that transportation capacity continues to increase, ensuring the needs of steel transportation. Furnace groups, factories and mines also stepped up the external transfer of pig iron. Many factories have basically achieved no iron reserves, and how much pig iron the blast furnace produces is how much they transport.
    Houba Iron and Steel Plant's Coke Oven Achieves Large-Scale High Yield

 Grasp Coke
    (Reported by this newspaper) Leading cadres of the coking workshop of Houba Iron and Steel Plant in Sichuan Province planted "high-yield command fields" on a large scale, taking the lead from a single point to achieve large-scale continuous high yield. From January 28 to February 8, the six No. 2 coke ovens had an average daily output of more than 46 tons per furnace, more than double the designed capacity. Among them, No. 1 furnace set a new provincial record of 100 tons and 120 tons of daily output, and the sulfur content, ash content and strength of coke all met the specified standards.
    Their experience is: coking production must take high temperature as the key, and achieve precision (wash away sulfur and ash, refined coal enters the furnace), fineness (the particle size of refined coal is below 2 to 3 mm), dryness (wet coal is dried before entering the furnace), sufficiency (sufficient reserves of dry refined coal, so that the coke oven is well-fed), tightness (refined coal entering the furnace is tightly loaded), quickness (quick opening of the furnace, quick coking, quick sealing of the furnace, quick loading of coal, quick quenching of coke), and diligence (frequent addition of coal, frequent inspection, frequent removal of ash, frequent leakage of the bottom, and frequent turning of slag).
    At present, the workers are determined to increase the average daily output per furnace to more than 50 tons with the spirit of continuous revolution, and strive for each furnace to create the latest records of 100 tons and 200 tons.

        Ode to Small Foreign Groups
    Although small, blast furnaces have sufficient drive
    Galloping to catch up with large blast furnaces
    Walking on two legs is a good policy
    Combining indigenous and foreign methods at high speed
    Small foreign groups shine brightly

    Xiaoxiba Iron and Steel Plant in Jiangyou County, Sichuan Province, mobilized the masses to carry out technical innovations, rapidly improving pig iron production, quality, and reducing costs. This is the coal yard that has realized the mechanization of crushed coal and the automatic screening of coal unloading. Xinhua News Agency reporter You Yungu photo

    小高炉前后左右齐跃进
    荣县大搞矿山技术改造
     抓矿石
    本报讯　四川荣县狠抓矿山改进，矿石日产量由四百多吨逐步提高到一千三百吨以上，含砂量由40％降低到10％，保证了高炉吃饱吃好，使生铁日产由五十多吨逐步提高到一百二十吨以上。
    荣县的矿石生产最初是采取遍地开采的“麻雀战”的办法，矿石品位低，矿井分散，运输困难。在这种情况下，有的干部就产生了叫高炉服从矿石生产，有多少矿石就炼多少铁的思想。为了扭转这种情况，县委几次对各厂负责干部指出矿山工作必须服从高炉生产，组织积极平衡，保证高炉吃饱、吃好，使生铁生产水平不断提高。领导干部思想问题解决后，各厂普遍组织群众开展辩论，使全体职工树立起“以产定料”的思想。在此基础上，县委大抓矿山改造，派两位县委书记深入生产第一线，加强领导，先组织勘查队和掘进专业队，对矿山进行全面勘查。以矿源丰富、质量好、运输方便的为主井，接着大搞掘进，加紧准备工作面，然后逐步缩短战线。这样，既保证了矿石产量和品位的提高，又保证了有足够的工作面。
    在逐步建立基地的同时，矿山普遍推广了深槽深眼爆破、大磴口作业、手扳钻打眼等先进采掘经验，使采矿工效平均提高一倍以上。
    在矿石运输方面，抓紧了“一网五化”的巩固和提高，运输量大大增加，现在，这个县的矿石生产不仅保证了高炉吃饱、吃好，而且还有五天多的储备量。
    达县专区水陆兼程突击运铁	抓运输
    本报讯　四川达县专区全体运铁职工战胜枯水和短途集运两大薄弱环节，大量外调好铁，以运保钢。2月上半月全区发运（包括中转）到重庆的生铁即达两万多吨。
    在运铁保钢的紧张战斗中，专区85％的干部深入调铁第一线。各级党委书记都亲自挂帅，大抓薄弱环节。专区运输指挥部把调运计划按日、按旬分配到线，分段包干，限期完成。宣汉县组织二万三千四百人，三百只木船、七十七辆板车和架车，突击短途运输。全区组织了三千多人的淘河大军，并发动沿江人民公社进行大规模的抗枯淘漕运动，经过短期突击，主要滩浅已经基本疏通。过去因水枯而中途卸载的生铁，现在也陆续中转外运。
    为了充分发挥现有运输工具的潜力，各县加强了车船的统一调度，推行汽车开双班带拖斗，木船开夜航，大搞双翼船和风帆化等，使运力不断加番，保证了钢铁运输的需要。各炉群、厂矿也抓紧了生铁外调工作，许多厂已基本做到了厂无存铁，高炉生产多少，就运多少。
    厚坝钢铁厂焦炉大面积高产	抓焦炭
    本报讯四川厚坝钢铁厂焦化车间领导干部大种“高产指挥田”，以点带面，实现了大面积持续高产，六座二号焦炉，从1月28日到2月8日，每炉平均日产量高达四十六吨以上，超过设计能力两倍多。其中一号炉连创日产一百吨和一百二十吨的全省新纪录，焦炭的硫分、灰分和强度都符合规定标准。
    他们的经验是：炼焦生产必须以高温为纲，做到精（洗净硫分、灰分、精煤入炉）、细（精煤粒度在二至三公厘以下）、干（湿煤炕干后才入炉）、足（干精煤储备充足，让焦炉吃饱）、紧（入炉精煤装紧）、快（开炉快、扒焦快、封炉快、装煤快、熄焦快）、勤（勤加煤、勤检查、勤出灰、勤漏底、勤翻渣）。
    目前，职工们正以不断革命的精神，决心把每炉平均日产量提高到五十吨以上，并且力争炉炉创造百吨和两百吨的最新纪录。
