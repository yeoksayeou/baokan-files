Early

The day before "Beginning of Spring," I arrived at Liyuan Commune in Yizhang County, Hunan Province. This commune is located south of the Five Ridges, bordering Guangdong Province, and has an earlier planting season. I had been here before in 1958, before the communization, when the season was "Awakening of Insects," a month later than now. However, at that time, people were concentrating their efforts on water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, with little spring plowing activity. Many were waiting for spring rains to flood the fields for rice seedlings. Two years later, the seasons are cycling as before, and the natural climate conditions have not changed. It is because the broad masses of farmers have mounted the "steed" of the people's commune, a large collective and large-scale production, and are carrying out a large-scale production movement that races against the seasons, pushing the preparatory work for spring plowing nearly a month ahead. In the fields, everywhere are crowds of people turning over the land, accumulating fertilizer, and transporting fertilizer. The entire production landscape has taken on a completely new look.

Early Start Leads to Initiative in Everything

In the fields, the weeds on the ridges have all been cleared, replaced early with a new look. Where red flags are waving, people are calling out to oxen turning the soil, and vast stretches of seedling fields have been leveled like mirrors. Teams transporting fertilizer, consisting of ox-carts and large flatbed carts, are busy transporting fertilizer to the fields from morning till night. In the fields, large piles of black fertilizer stretch into the distance, one after another. Girls evenly spread the fermented mixed fertilizer into the fields, and the plowing teams quickly turn the fields over, pressing the fertilizer into the soil in layers. Although the deciduous trees here have not yet sprouted, spring has already arrived early, and the large-scale spring plowing production has already begun.

"An early start is a hundred early starts, one step ahead leads to initiative in every step." Chen Yangli, the first secretary of the commune Party committee who led me on the tour, began to narrate how they raced against the seasons and completed all the preparatory work for spring plowing before the Beginning of Spring. Last winter, they completed the earthwork and stonework for water conservancy, equivalent to twice the total amount of water conservancy earthwork and stonework in the ten years since liberation. However, everyone pressed on and basically completed the water conservancy work by the end of last November. This quickly freed up their hands to accumulate large amounts of fertilizer. Now, each mu has more than 600 dan of mixed fertilizer. Because they have achieved "one pig per mu," this year, refined fertilizer accounts for nearly half. Therefore, this year's fertilizer is abundant and of good quality, and 80% of the fertilizer has already been transported to the fields. Currently, of the commune's 3,700-plus mu of early rice seedling fields, more than 1,800 mu have been fertilized with sufficient base fertilizer and leveled. Chen Yangli ended his talk with eight words: "An early start leads to initiative in everything."

Trees Don't Know Spring, People Do

Appropriately advancing the season is a production increase experience that has been explored in the agricultural Great Leap Forward in recent years, especially in the last two years. It is also a new thing that has grown up in the continuous struggle against right-leaning conservative thinking. Many small stories of the struggle between new and old ideas are still circulating among the masses here. The story of "Old Man Wang Only Knows Spring at Sixty" is one of them. Wang Liangcai is a 60-year-old farmer who is a well-known farming expert in the Gantangwan Production Team, but his thinking is somewhat conservative, clinging to the old almanac. In 1958, this place summarized the experience of increasing production and decided to advance the sowing period of early rice from "Qingming" (Tomb Sweeping Day) to "Chunfen" (Vernal Equinox), striving for a bumper harvest in both the early and late seasons. Old Man Wang did not agree. He said: "Qingming" ends the snow, "Guyu" ends the frost, and sowing after the tung trees bloom (Qingming) is the old rule. As a result, others soaked their seeds at "Chunfen," while the farming group he led did not sow their more than fifteen mu of rice fields until three days after "Qingming." Because the early rice was transplanted late and harvested late, the late rice was squeezed to be transplanted two or three days after "Liqiu" (Beginning of Autumn), and the flowering period of the late rice coincided with the cold wave. At the autumn harvest, others harvested 300 to 400 jin per mu of late rice, while they only harvested more than 100 jin, a difference of half the yield. The team members criticized his conservative thinking for harming people. Old Man Wang was unconvinced, saying, "They're just lucky, let's see next year." In 1959, the common practice here was to sow at "Chunfen," with a small portion sowing as early as after "Jingzhe" (Awakening of Insects). The late rice all yielded 400 to 500 jin per mu, and the early rice harvest was also very good. The Tangjia production team had five mu of late rice fields that were transplanted one day after "Liqiu" due to the delay, missing the season. Compared with the late rice planted before "Liqiu" with the same cultivation, each mu yielded 21 jin less of grain. Old Man Wang Liangcai personally participated in the acceptance work of these five mu of late rice fields. At this time, he was finally convinced. Now, he says to everyone he meets: "Spring competes for days, summer competes for time. An early start is a hundred early starts, transplanting one day early is really good." On the second day of the first lunar month this year, Old Man Wang was the first to lead his ox to the fields for spring plowing. The entire team's concentrated 50-plus mu of early rice seedling fields were leveled the day before "Beginning of Spring." Old Man Wang was selected as the old farmer consultant of the seedling raising group. He spends all day carrying his hoe and walking around the seedling fields. When he saw that the experimental seedlings cultivated using hot springs in the previous winter had already grown green leaves, he exclaimed, "Now it is true that the trees don't know spring, but people do." Thus, the story of "Old Man Wang Only Knows Spring at Sixty" spread among the nearby masses.

Breaking the Ice to Plow, Making a Big Fuss About Spring Plowing

On the day of "Beginning of Spring," on the 100-mu seedling field base of the Longshaping Brigade, the two brothers Chen Qiyang and Chen Bayang, both in their sixties, stood on the field ridge and talked with infinite emotion about the fact that the seedling fields had been prepared before this year's "Beginning of Spring." Originally, this was an arid area. During the small-scale peasant economy, everyone waited anxiously for the spring rains to flood the fields before making seedling fields, generally sowing after "Qingming." In 1956, the Longshaping and Yong'an agricultural cooperatives here broke the ground and prepared the seedling fields around "Jingzhe," sowing more than 20 mu. As a result, they encountered a spring drought, the seedling fields cracked open, and the seedlings dried up. They had to plow and re-sow after the spring rains, which actually delayed the sowing season. Last spring, a 25-horsepower water pump was installed here, causing river water to cross mountains and irrigate more than 800 mu of farmland. At the beginning of spring this year, although there had been almost a month without rain, they had water pumps for irrigation and no longer needed to wait for spring rains to make seedling fields. Last winter, they started leveling the seedling fields. In this area that was once extremely short of water, preparing the seedling fields the year before was big news locally.

Early has now deeply penetrated people's hearts. People no longer wait for spring to fill the earth before starting to get busy, but actively and proactively do all the preparatory work in advance when the branches have not yet sprouted and spring has not yet emerged, catching up to the front of spring. From morning to night, people are busy turning over the soil, transporting fertilizer, reclaiming wasteland, preparing the soil, and leveling the seedling fields. The fields are really bustling with activity and steaming with heat. Here, there are many moving deeds that urge spring forward. Huang Huaiying, the women's double-shared plow expert, led the "March 8th" women's plowing team, which started breaking the ice to plow on the second day of the first lunar month, making a big fuss about spring plowing, averaging four and a half mu of plowed land per person per day, creating a new record for plowing in the entire commune. Peng Wanfu, a Communist Party member, created a new tool of oxen-pulled mud boats in the leveling of land by combining small hills into large hills, increasing work efficiency by an average of more than ten times compared to manual soil carrying.

Dryland Crops Have Also Been Sown

This year, the dryland crops here have also undergone a major revolution. In previous years, no one would have paid attention to dryland crops at this time, but now most of the commune's 8,700-plus mu of dryland has been fertilized with base fertilizer and leveled. The first batch of early corn has already been sown, and more than 100 pumpkin hills have also been sown. Sweet potato warm bed seedling raising has been widely carried out. The first batch of more than 420,000 jin of sweet potato seedlings were planted before the Spring Festival. The earliest sweet potato seedlings cultivated by Li Shipeng, a well-known sweet potato labor model in the county and a 50-plus-year-old poor peasant commune member of this commune, are more than a foot deep. This year, the planting season for the commune's 5,700-plus mu of summer sweet potatoes will be advanced from the past "Dragon Boat Festival" planting to starting after "Qingming." This is something that people would not have dared to imagine in the past.

Moonlit Night Water Delivery

Here, the word "early" has become the central theme of people's conversations. Talking about the early rice fields, also talking about the early dryland, talking about how they advance the season, and also doing everything possible to help others advance the season. "Li Sandie's Moonlit Night Water Delivery" is a moving story. Li Sandie is 58 years old this year and is a model water watcher of the Kuzhu Production Team. On the evening of the second day of the first lunar month, after hearing the call of the commune Party committee to "advance spring plowing," he kept thinking in bed that the Miaojiaoping Production Team downstream was a water-deficient area, and how could they advance spring plowing without water? Last year, they waited for the surplus water from the spring irrigation and plowing of the upstream Kuzhu Team before plowing their fields. Because the water source was not good, they dared not advance spring plowing. Their field base was more fertile than that of the Kuzhu Team, but because both the early and late rice were transplanted ten days later, the yield per mu was 55 jin less than that of the Kuzhu Team's rice fields. Now that the reservoir has been built and more water has been stored, why can't we irrigate from downstream, so that everyone can advance spring plowing and comprehensively increase production? Thinking of this, Li Sandie couldn't sleep anyway. He got out of bed, carried his hoe, and, using the moonlight, released the water from the reservoir into the more than 40 mu of winter fallow fields of the downstream Miaojiaoping Production Team. The next day, Li Xiangtai, the Party branch secretary of the Miaojiaoping Production Team, went to the field and was very surprised. He was originally worried that there was no water to advance spring plowing, so why was the rice field filled with water overnight? He walked along the canal and found Li Sandie watching the water. He quickly asked Li Sandie: "Why are you irrigating from downstream this year?" Li Sandie smiled and said: "It's good for everyone to increase production!" Li Xiangtai hurried back and announced Li Sandie's act of delivering water to their doorstep on a moonlit night to the commune members. Everyone was very moved. On the same day, the entire team dispatched 21 plowing cattle and plowed the more than 40 mu of winter fallow fields in advance.

This kind of noble communist new style of thinking of others everywhere can be encountered everywhere in the large-scale spring plowing production here. Wen Chunxiu, the captain of the Yong'an Production Team and a Communist Party member, was overjoyed that his arid area could irrigate with water pumps this year and prepare seedling fields in advance, but he quickly thought of the difficulties in raising seedlings early in the cold mountainous areas of the Yiziling and other three production teams. He took the initiative to link up with these three production teams and planned to use labor exchange to help them raise 22 mu of early rice seedlings well in the plains. This matter greatly moved the members of the Yiziling and other three production teams. Each team dispatched 40 people to launch a two-day assault to burn more than 100,000 jin of fire-soil ash fertilizer for the Yong'an Production Team on the mountain. This year, in seedling raising here, the method of unified planning of seedling fields, concentrated patches, specialized management, batch sowing, and mutual adjustment is generally adopted, so that all 18 mountainous production teams with later seasons in the commune are raising the first batch of early rice seedlings in the plains. The contradiction that could not raise seedlings early due to the low temperature in the mountains in the past has been resolved.

When all the commune members had already made a big fuss about spring plowing and formed a production upsurge, the commune Party committee took a step ahead again. On the day I left the commune, the commune Party committee was holding a meeting to study how to vigorously promote rice transplanters and train rice transplanter operators...carefully arranging the next step of work.

专栏：

    早
    “立春”前一天，我到了湖南省宜章县栗源公社。这个公社位于五岭以南，和广东省交界，耕种季节较早。1958年公社化前，我曾到过这里，那时节令是“惊蛰”，比现在要迟一个月。可是，当时人们还集中力量在修水利、积肥，春耕活动很少，许多人还在等待着春雨发水作秧田。两年后的今天，节令周而复始地循环运转着，气候自然条件并没有什么变化，就是由于广大农民跨上了大集体、大生产的人民公社这匹“骏马”，开展着与季节赛跑的大生产运动，便把备耕工作提前了近一个月。田野里，到处是翻耕土地、积肥运肥的人群，整个的生产面貌焕然一新。
    早字带头，万事主动
    田野里，到处田塍杂草铲光了，提早换上了新装。在红旗招展的地方，人们吆喝着牛在翻耕，成片的秧田已整得田平如镜，由牛拉车和大板车组成的运肥队伍，从早到晚忙碌地运肥下田。田间，黑色的大肥堆，一个接一个地伸向远方。姑娘们均匀地把沤制好的混合肥料撒到田里，翻耕队驱着牛很快地把田翻耕过来，分层地把肥料压到泥土里。尽管这儿的落叶树还未发芽，春天已经提早来了，春耕大生产已经开始了。
    “一早百早，一步主动，步步主动。”领我参观的公社党委第一书记陈扬礼开始叙述他们如何和季节赛跑、把一切备耕工作抢在立春前做好的情况。去冬，他们完成水利的土石方，相当解放后十年水利土石方总数的一倍，可是大家一鼓作气，在去年11月底就基本上结束了水利工作。这样，很快就腾出手来，大积肥料。现在，每亩有混合肥料六百多担。由于实现了“一亩田一头猪”，今年精肥将近占到一半。因此今年肥料又多又好，而且有80％的肥料已经运下了田。现在，全社三千七百多亩早稻秧田，已有一千八百多亩施足基肥，平整好了。陈扬礼用八个字结束了他的谈话：“早字带头，万事主动”。
      树不知春人知春
    适当提早季节，是几年来特别是近两年农业大跃进中摸索出来的一条增产经验，也是在不断和右倾保守思想斗争中成长起来的新事物。这里群众中还流传许多新、旧思想斗争的小故事。“王老汉六十才知春”的故事，就是其中的一个。王良才是位六十岁的老农，在甘棠湾生产队是有名的作田能手，就是思想有些保守，抓住老皇历不放手。1958年这里总结增产经验，决定把早稻播种期由“清明”提早到
  “春分”，争取早、晚两季丰收。王老汉不同意，他说：“清明”断雪，“谷雨”断霜，桐子开花（清明）才下种是老规矩。结果，别人“春分”浸种，他领导的耕作组十五亩多稻田在“清明”后三天才播种。因为早稻插得晚，收得迟，晚稻被挤到“立秋”后两、三天才插下去，晚稻扬花期正碰上寒潮。秋收时，别人晚稻亩产三、四百斤，他们只收一百多斤，产量相差一半。组员们都批评他的保守思想害死人。王老汉心不服，说什么：“总算他们运气好，明年再看吧。”1959年，这里普遍是“春分”播种，有一小部分提早在“惊蛰”后就播了种，晚稻都亩产四、五百斤，早稻收成也很好。汤家作业组有五亩晚稻田因为推迟到“立秋”后一天才插下去，误了季节，和同样耕作的在“立秋”前插的晚稻比较起来，每亩少收二十一斤谷。王良才老汉亲自参加了这五亩晚稻田的验收工作，这时，他才心服。现在逢人就说：“春争日，夏争时。一早百早，早插一天硬是好。”今年农历正月初二，王老汉第一个牵着牛下田春耕。全队集中成片的五十多亩早稻秧田，在“立春”前一天就整平了。王老汉被选为育秧小组的老农顾问。他成天扛着锄头在秧田边转，当他看到隔年冬天利用温泉培育的试验秧苗已经长出了绿叶，感叹地说：“如今硬是树不知春人知春”。于是“王老汉六十才知春”的故事，就在附近群众中传开了。
    破冰犁田　大闹春耕
    “立春”那天，在龙沙坪大队的百亩秧田基地上，六十多岁的陈七养、陈八养两兄弟站在田塍上，无限感慨地谈论着今年“立春”前就作好了秧田的事。原来这是一个干旱地区，在小农经济时期，大家都眼巴巴地等春雨发水才作秧田，一般要在“清明”后才播种。1956年这里龙沙坪、永安两个农业社破天荒地提早季节在“惊蛰”前后作好秧田，播种了二十多亩。结果碰上春旱，秧田开了坼，秧苗干死了，只好在春雨后翻耕重播种，反而推迟了播种季节。去年春天，这里安装了一台二十五马力的抽水机，叫河水翻山越岭地灌溉着八百多亩农田。今年初春，尽管这里已有将近一个月没有下雨，他们有抽水机灌溉，再不需要等春雨作秧田了。去年冬天，他们就开始了平整秧田工作。在这个过去水源奇缺的地区，隔年作好了秧田，在当地是一件大新闻。
    早，现在已深入人心。人们不再是等待春满大地，才开始忙碌，而是在树枝尚未发芽、春天还没有露头的时候，就积极主动地把一切备耕工作都预先做好，迎着春的头前赶上去。从早到晚，人们忙碌地翻耕、送肥、开荒、整土和平整秧田。田野里真是人声鼎沸，热气腾腾。在这里，有不少催春的动人事迹。妇女双铧犁能手黄怀英领导的“三八”妇女翻耕队，从正月初二开始就破冰犁田，大闹春耕，平均每人每天犁田四亩半，创造了全社耕田的新纪录。共产党员彭万福在小丘并大丘的平整土地中，创造了牛拉泥船的新工具，工效比人工挑土平均提高十多倍。
      旱地作物也下种了
    今年这里的旱地作物也来了个大革命。往年这时，旱地作物还没有人去过问，可是现在全社八千七百多亩旱地大部分都施了基肥，平整好了。第一批早包谷已经播种了，一百多个南瓜山也播了种。红薯温床育苗已经普遍搞起来了。第一批红薯种四十二万多斤，在春节前就种下去了。全县有名的红薯劳动模范——这个社的五十多岁的贫农社员李世鹏培育的红薯苗，最早的有一尺多深了。今年全社五千七百多亩夏红薯的栽插季节，将由过去“端午”节栽插提早到“清明”后开始。这是过去人们连想都不敢想的事。
            月夜送水
    在这里，“早”字已成为人们谈话的中心主题。谈水稻田早，也谈旱地早，谈自己如何提早季节，也千方百计地帮助别人提早季节。“李三爹月夜送水”就是一个动人的故事。李三爹今年五十八岁，是苦竹生产队的模范看水员，大年初二晚上，他听到公社党委发出“提早春耕”的号召后，睡在床上老是想着下游的庙脚坪生产队是个缺水地方，没有水，怎么提早春耕呢？去年他们是等着上游苦竹队春灌翻耕后的余水才犁田的，因为水源不好，不敢提早春耕。他们的田底子比苦竹队的肥，就因为早、晚稻都迟插十来天秧，结果亩产量反而比苦竹队的稻田少收五十五斤谷子。今年水库修好了，蓄水多了，为什么不能从下游灌起，让大家都提早春耕，全面增产呢？李三爹想到这里，怎么也睡不下去。他爬起床，扛着锄头，借着月光，把水库里的水放到下游庙脚坪生产队的四十多亩冬闲田里。第二天，庙脚坪生产队的党支书李相泰到田边一看，感到很惊奇。原先愁着没有水提早春耕，为什么一夜之间，稻田里灌满了水呢？他沿着渠道走去，发现李三爹在看水。他连忙问李三爹：“今年为什么要从下游灌起？”李三爹笑一笑说：“要大家增产才好哩！”李相泰赶回去，就把李三爹月夜送水上门的事向社员们宣布了。大家都很感动。当天，全队出动二十一条耕牛，把四十多亩冬闲田提前翻耕了。
  这种处处为别人着想的高尚的共产主义新风格的事情，在这里春耕大生产中，到处可以碰到。永安生产队的队长、共产党员文春秀，当他为自己这个干旱地区今年有抽水机灌溉，能够提早作秧田而感到万分高兴的时候，就很快想到高山寒冻地区的椅子岭等三个生产队提早育秧的困难。他主动地和这三个生产队挂好钩，计划用换工的方式，代替他们在平原地区育好二十二亩早稻秧苗。这件事，使得椅子岭等三个生产队的社员很受感动。他们每个队抽出四十个人，突击两天，为永安生产队在山上烧制好十多万斤火土灰肥料。今年这里在育秧中，普遍采取统一规划秧田，集中成片，专业经营，分批播种，互相调剂的办法，使得全社十八个季节较迟的山地生产队都在平原地区育第一批早稻秧苗。过去由于山地气温低，不能提早育秧的矛盾解决了。
    当全体社员已经大闹春耕，形成生产高潮的时候，公社党委又早走了一步。我离开公社的那一天，公社党委会正在开会研究如何大力推广插秧机、训练插秧机手……细致地安排下一步的工作了。
