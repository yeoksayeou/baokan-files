	"Volunteer Medical Team"
	Cao Chenglong
	As the red sun rose from the east, several young men in the engine repair factory's collective dormitory jumped out of bed, quickly rinsed their mouths, washed their faces, packed their bags, hurriedly ate breakfast, and set off for the suburban commune with their tool bags on their backs.

	Cao Dabiao walked at the front of the team, saying to his companions behind him, "This time, we must fix that 'old tractor'! And while we're at it, we'll cure those 'old diesels' too."

	One of the shorter, sturdier fellows in the group chimed in, "Never mind 'old tractors' or 'old diesels,' as long as we 'doctors' get our hands on them, we'll make sure they don't sleep again!"

	It turned out that these young men were technicians from the engine repair factory. They had organized a "Holiday Volunteer Medical Team" and planned to spend the Spring Festival repairing broken tractors and diesel engines for the suburban commune.

	The suburban commune wasn't far from the city, only half an hour's walk. Cao Dabiao led everyone into the commune office and immediately saw Secretary Ma, to whom he explained their purpose.

	Secretary Ma shook each of their hands and said, "We are so grateful! You truly are the elder brothers of the workers."

	Everyone followed Secretary Ma to the parking lot and immediately surrounded the ailing tractor. Suddenly, an old man in his fifties turned out from the side of the tractor. Everyone was stunned: "Isn't that Master Hu from our factory! What's he doing here?"

	The old man saw everyone's stunned expressions and couldn't help but laugh. "What, don't you recognize me?" Then he asked Cao Dabiao, "Dabiao, can your 'medical team' take on this old member?"

	Cao Dabiao said, "We welcome you to join. But didn't you say you were going home to visit relatives for the Spring Festival?"

	"What, isn't this family too? We workers and peasants are closer than blood relatives!"

	These words were well said, and everyone nodded in agreement.

	Just as work was about to begin, Master Hu suddenly turned his head and said to Secretary Ma, "Please ask the driver to come and inspect the machine with us, so we can 'consult' together if there are any problems."

	Secretary Ma laughed, "Old brother, show us everything you've got this time. The commune has not only asked the driver to come and learn repair techniques, but has also organized many young people to learn the principles of the machines!"

	As they were talking, a group of young commune members poured into the parking lot, laughing and joking.

	Cao Dabiao divided the people into two groups, one following Master Hu to repair the tractor, and the other led by himself to repair the diesel engines.

	The inspection work began. Here, Master Hu carefully inspected the various parts of the tractor while constantly explaining to the young people beside him: "This machine is like a person, but it can't talk. If it is used properly and well maintained, its life can be extended..."

	About two hours later, the diesel engine suddenly roared "tet-tet-tet." Everyone turned their attention to it.

	Cao Dabiao ran over and said, "Those diesel engines can all be repaired by tomorrow! We have to run ahead of Master Hu!"

	Master Hu said unconvinced, "Don't think you can bully this old man. Let's have a labor competition to see who finishes the task first!"

	Everyone cheered. It was already near noon, and Secretary Ma insisted that everyone rest. As everyone was washing their hands, Master Hu suddenly remembered something else and said, "Secretary Ma, we have to have a technical lesson tonight. I'll explain to everyone the causes of these machine breakdowns and the operating methods, what do you think?"

	Secretary Ma said, "This is something we've been hoping for, how could it not be okay? The Houzhuang Elementary School is on winter vacation, so let's hold the class there tonight."

	At noon, the commune canteen was filled with steam. Workers and peasants sat around table after table, eating delicious meat dumplings.

    “义务医疗队”
    曹成龙
    红日刚从东方升起，动力机修厂集体宿舍里的几个青年小伙子一骨碌起了身，连忙漱口洗脸，整顿行装，匆匆地吃了早点，背上工具袋便向郊区公社出发了。
    曹大标走在小队最前面，边走边和后面的伙伴们说：“这一回呀，咱们一定得把那台‘老拖’医好！顺便再把那几台‘老柴’也治好。”
    伙伴中一个矮壮个子接口说：“管它‘老拖’‘老柴’，只要叫咱们这些‘大夫’碰着，保证不让它再睡觉！”
    原来这群小伙子是动力机修厂的技术工人。他们组织了“假期义务医疗队”，计划春节期间给郊区公社修理出了毛病的拖拉机和柴油机。
    郊区公社离城不远，步行半小时便到了。曹大标领着大家走进公社办公室，一眼见到了公社马书记，便把来意说明。
    马书记一个个握着他们的手说：“这可太感谢你们了！你们真不愧是工人老大哥。”
    大家随着马书记来到了停车场，立刻向那台病拖拉机围了过去。忽然，拖拉机侧面转出一个五十多岁的老头来。大家一看都楞住了：“这不是咱厂的胡师傅吗！他怎么跑到这儿来了？”
    老头见大家发楞，不由哈哈笑道：“怎么，不认识我了吗？”接着他问曹大标：“大标子，你们‘医疗队’能吸收我这个老队员吗？”
    曹大标说：“我们欢迎你参加。不过你老人家不是说春节回家探亲的吗？”
    “怎么，这里不就是亲吗？咱们工人和农民比亲骨肉还亲哩！”
    这话说得好，大伙都点头赞同。
    工作刚要开始，胡师傅忽又转过头去叫马书记说：“请驾驶员同志来和咱们一起检修吧，要有什么毛病咱们也好共同‘会诊’。”
    马书记笑道：“老哥，这回你有什么就都往外拿吧，公社不但叫驾驶员来学习检修技术，还组织了许多青年人来学习机器原理呢？”
    这边正说着话，一群青年社员已经嘻嘻哈哈地涌进了停车场。
    曹大标把人分成两组，一组跟着胡师傅检修这台拖拉机，另一组由自己带去检修柴油机。
    检修工作开始了。这里胡师傅一面仔细地检查着拖拉机的各个部件，一面又不停地向身旁的青年们讲解着：“这机器就像个人，不过它不会说话。要是使用得当，保养好，它的寿命可以延长……”
    大约过了两个多钟点，那边的柴油机突然响起了“特特特”的吼叫声。大家都把目光投了过去。
    曹大标跑来说：“那几台柴油机明天都能修好！咱们可要跑在胡师傅的前面了！”
    胡师傅不服气地说：“你可别想欺负我老头子，咱们不妨来个劳动竞赛，看谁先完成任务！”
    两旁的人一齐叫好。这时已近正午了，马书记硬要大家休息。大家洗着手，胡师傅忽然又想起了一件事情，说：“马书记，今天晚上咱们得上堂技术课。我把这些机器使坏的原因和操作方法向大家讲解讲解，你看行吧？”
    马书记说：“这是求之不得的事，怎么不行？后庄小学校放了寒假，咱们今晚就在那里开课。”
    中午，公社食堂里热气腾腾。工人和农民围坐了一桌又一桌，吃着美味的肉馅饺子。
