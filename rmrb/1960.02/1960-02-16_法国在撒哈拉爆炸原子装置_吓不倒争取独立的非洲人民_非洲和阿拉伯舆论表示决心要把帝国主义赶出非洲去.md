Xinhua News Agency, February 15th—Arab countries' public opinion and political figures have expressed great indignation and protest against the French authorities' act of exploding an atomic device in the Sahara Desert, despite the opposition and warnings of people all over the world.

The Secretary-General of the Arab League, Hassouna, said on the 13th, in response to this French atrocity, that it shows France is recklessly pursuing a policy based on force and undermining the principles of the United Nations. He said that France's actions once again prove that the Algerian people's struggle against imperialism is just because the imperialists disregard human rights.

According to the Middle East News Agency, representatives attending the current Arab League Council meeting expressed anger at France's action. Aziz, the chief representative of Saudi Arabia, said that today, Arab countries feel more deeply than ever the brutality of French imperialism. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain solid unity with the Algerian National Liberation Army until final victory is achieved.

The Secretary-General of the Arab Trade Union Federation, Asaad Ragheh, sent telegrams on the 14th in the name of Arab workers to the United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council, the Preparatory Committee of the All-African Trade Union Federation, and other workers' organizations, condemning France's explosion of atomic devices in the Sahara. He said that this action would strengthen the determination of African countries to drive out French imperialism.

A thousand students in the Syrian region of the United Arab Republic held a demonstration on the streets of Damascus on the 14th, shouting slogans such as "Down with the criminal de Gaulle."

Many newspapers in Cairo published editorials on the 14th, condemning France's actions. The "Republic News" editorial stated that France's crime is digging its own grave on the great African land. The Algerians clearly know that France's action is a sign of weakness, not a sign of strength.

Some newspapers in Iraq also published editorials on the same day. "National News" pointed out that France's sinful act shows that "France will continue to undermine world peace and exacerbate world tensions." It called on governments and people of all countries to submit the matter to international organizations to force France to grant independence and freedom to the Algerian people.

Xinhua News Agency, February 15th—Governments, political parties, public organizations, and newspapers in Morocco and other African countries have condemned France's crime of exploding atomic devices in the Sahara region.

The Moroccan cabinet held a special meeting on the evening of the 13th. According to the published communique, the meeting discussed the situation caused by France's atomic device explosion and decided to take some measures.

Some political parties and labor unions in Morocco also held meetings on the 13th, calling for the immediate withdrawal of French troops from Morocco and the African continent, and demanding a severance of all relations with France.

The National Union of People's Forces of Morocco demanded that the Moroccan government take serious measures to counterattack the French government's provocation.

The Moroccan Labor Union expressed hope that Moroccan workers and workers throughout Africa will do their best to fight French imperialism until Africa achieves complete liberation. The Labor Union said that the only guarantee that France cannot commit this kind of crime again is to let France withdraw its troops from the African continent.

According to Khartoum newspapers on the 15th, Sudanese Foreign Minister Kher summoned the French Ambassador to Sudan on the 14th and asked him to inform the French government that the Sudanese government was extremely concerned after receiving the news of France's atomic device explosion in the Sahara. He warned that "if France insists on continuing a series of atomic tests as it has announced, it will suffer serious consequences."

The Ghana Committee Against Atomic Weapons issued a statement on the 13th after the French atomic device explosion, saying, "France has joined the atomic club, but has withdrawn from the club of human beings who respect the rights of others." The statement said, "The committee will continue to support the crucial struggle of Africans to liberate their newly developed continent from the mad nuclear arms race."

The Tunisian General Labour Union said in a resolution that France's actions threaten all residents of Africa.

Nimr Yusuf, director of the Equatorial Africa Bureau of the African Association in Cairo, said in a protest statement on the 14th that the Equatorial African people's struggle for independence will never be intimidated by France's atomic device explosion.

The Nigerian "Sunday Times" said on the 14th that the "reaction obtained by France's explosion is just the indignation of an angry continent."
