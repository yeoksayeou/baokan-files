    Spanning the North and South of the Yangtze River, Connecting the Three Towns of Wuhan
    First Cross-Yangtze High-Voltage Line Completed

    (Our dispatch) China's first high-voltage power transmission line across the Yangtze River, built in Wuhan, was successfully erected on January 28th.

    This cross-river high-voltage transmission line project, designed by China itself, is a pioneering undertaking in the history of China's power industry construction. The voltage of the cross-river line is 220 kilovolts and can be increased to 330 kilovolts as needed. The scale of the project is enormous, and the technology is new and complex. The main towers standing on the north and south banks of the Yangtze River are 146.75 meters high, equivalent to more than 40 stories high, 26.75 meters higher than the tallest chimney of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, making them the tallest buildings in Wuhan and the tallest transmission line towers in the country. A steel cable more than an inch in diameter, weighing 75.82 tons, has crossed the 1,700-meter-wide rolling Yangtze River, connecting the two tall towers. The completion of this line will make it the only main line currently connecting the power grids of the three towns of Wuhan. It can transmit 4.25 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per day, which can send the powerful current generated by the Qingshan Thermal Power Plant to Hankou and Hanyang, supplying the needs of the leaping development of industry and agriculture. This line will also become one of the main lines connecting the powerful power grids of Wuhan, northern Hubei, and Danjiangkou.

    The staff of the Wuhan Electric Power Design Institute and the Hubei Provincial Electric Power Construction Bureau, who were responsible for the design and construction of this project, creatively used reinforced concrete structures. Under the conditions of relatively weak construction technical strength and lack of construction machinery, they relied on the masses and adopted a combination of indigenous and foreign methods for construction. Since the groundbreaking in July 1958, the project progress has been accelerating day by day. For example, when pouring the north bank cross-river tower, the workers innovated the transportation method five times, increasing work efficiency by four times. Subsequently, the south bank cross-river tower, which was originally planned to be constructed at the end of December last year, was started in September, and a cross-cycle operation method was adopted. With half the manpower reduced, the speed was doubled compared to the north bank tower.

### 横跨大江南北　贯通武汉三镇  首条跨江高压线架通

    横跨大江南北　贯通武汉三镇
    首条跨江高压线架通
    本报讯　在武汉架设的我国第一条跨越长江的高压输电线，已于1月28日胜利架通。
    这个由我国自己设计的跨江高压输电线工程，是我国电力工业建设史上的创举。跨江线的电压是二百二十千伏，根据需要还可升至三百三十千伏。工程规模巨大，技术新颖复杂。矗立在长江南北两岸的主杆塔，高达一百四十六点七五米，相当于四十多层楼房高，比武钢最高的烟筒还高二十六点七五米，是武汉市最高的建筑物，也是全国最高的送电线路塔。一条直径一寸多粗、重达七十五点八二吨的钢线已经跨过一千七百米宽的滚滚长江，将两座高塔连接起来。这条线路的建成，将是目前沟通武汉三镇电力网的唯一干线，它一天能输电四百二十五万度，可以把青山热电厂所发出的强大电流送到汉口、汉阳，供给工、农业飞跃发展的需要。这条线路同时也将成为沟通武汉、鄂北、丹江口等地的强大电网的主要干线之一。
    担负这项工程设计和施工的武汉电力设计院、湖北省电力基建局职工创造性地运用了钢筋混凝土结构。他们在施工技术力量比较薄弱和施工机具缺乏的条件下，依靠群众，采取土洋并举的施工方法，从1958年7月破土动工以来，工程进度一天快似一天。比如浇灌北岸跨江塔时，工人们五次革新了运输方法，提高工效四倍。接着，又把原计划在去年12月底施工的南岸跨江塔提前在9月施工，并采取了交叉循环作业的施工方法，在人力减少一半的情况下，速度比北岸塔加快了一倍。
