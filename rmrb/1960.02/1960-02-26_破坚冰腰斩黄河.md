	Breaking the Ice and Severing the Yellow River
	Xie Shiyan, Zhang Zhichu
	Ten Hours to End the Battle

	The frozen Yellow River, at first glance, seems so calm and so docile, like a hibernating giant python. However, it conceals a terrifying power. As the moment of closure approaches, the river water suddenly rises by about one meter, and the ice layer several kilometers away will suddenly tear apart. The rushing river water, carrying ice blocks weighing nearly a hundred tons, surges down. It can, in an instant, destroy the entire cofferdam and break the ropes around its neck.

	So, wouldn't it be much easier to postpone it for a month, wait for the ice to melt, and then dam the river? However, our builders are very stingy with time. Just to gain a month, they are willing to expend twice the energy. Because gaining a month can advance the excavation of the second phase of the foundation project, striving for the initiative in early irrigation and early power generation this year.

	The damming site is full of creativity. Starting from February 9th, tens of thousands of packets of explosives shattered 60,000 square meters of ice layer within a range of four to five hundred meters above and below the closure point. Four mountain guns were erected on the hills on both banks, ready to bombard the huge ice blocks rushing down from upstream at any time. Veteran river workers directed people to move small ice floes, allowing them to pass smoothly through the closure gap and bottom holes. The huge ice blocks that flowed down were also drilled with holes and tied to wooden stakes with steel cables… People used only ten hours to cut off the Yellow River. What a spirit, what a style.

	The heroic feat of damming during the ice period immediately reveals the mental outlook of the Qingtongxia builders. But the heroic deeds of the heroes that shake the mountains and rivers are far more than this one! In the excavation of the dam foundation, they encountered complex geological conditions rarely seen in water conservancy construction, such as fractured dam foundations, thick overburden, and many large faults, with severe underground seepage. The foundation pit and faults were like a never-ending pond, leaving the construction workers with no foothold. However, the builders knew that millions of Hui and Han people in Ningxia were gazing at Qingtongxia! For two thousand years, our ancestors have used the slope of the Yellow River to divert water from Qingtongxia for irrigation. The famous Tanglai Canal and Qin-Han Canal, like mammary glands, nurtured the entire Yinchuan Plain, earning it the reputation of "Ningxia is rich thanks to the Yellow River." However, God did not want to give the people of Ningxia a special gift. Because the river water was not controlled, not only was irrigation not guaranteed, but also 450,000 workdays had to be spent every year on silt removal. More seriously, in dry years, the canals had no water, and people had to resort to praying to the gods. I remember in those severely drought-stricken days, even the millet planted near the mouth of the gorge was so dry that it could burn, while the entire Yinchuan Plain was a vast expanse of red land, and herds of sheep in the semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas died in the wilderness. Therefore, another saying spread here: "Without irrigation, there is no agriculture; without agriculture, there is no Ningxia." The Hui and Han people have long yearned to build a dam in Qingtongxia to completely control the Yellow River in their own hands.

	The drums of the Great Leap Forward urged the Qingtongxia water conservancy project to get underway.

	Forcing the Yellow River to Surrender its Position

	Soon after construction began, winter arrived, and the freezing period was approaching. The Party Committee of the Engineering Bureau decided to create a high-speed construction situation in Qingtongxia in this first winter, demanding that the Yellow River be forced to give up half of the river valley and surrender its position before the ice floes arrived, so as to immediately carry out dam foundation excavation and ensure the early completion of the first phase of the project. According to general construction experience, sand and gravel cofferdams or wooden cage cofferdams are mostly used, but there were no vehicles to transport sand and gravel, no wood to make wooden cages, and, more importantly, no more time. Therefore, they boldly used the rich water management experience of the Hui and Han people of Ningxia for thousands of years, and for the first time built grass and soil on the main stream of the Yellow River as a water-retaining structure. Although the river water repeatedly washed away whole chunks of the grass-soil mixture, the Party Secretary and the Director of the Engineering Bureau stood on the soon-to-be-collapsed grass-soil mixture, directing people to dump bundles of wheat straw and carts of soil into the river. Veteran grass-soil technicians and local experts ate at the construction site, lived at the construction site, and stood at the forefront to carry out the most complex operations. More than a dozen large sailboats, fully loaded with wheat straw, rushed to the construction site day and night from various communes in the Yinchuan Plain. In this way, in just over a month, after six failures, the cofferdam was finally closed. A grass-soil cofferdam, more than 500 meters long and 16 meters wide, stood in the rapid currents of the Yellow River, more than two meters deep, ensuring the excavation of the dam foundation in winter.

	In spring, the Yinchuan Plain awakened, and the commune members sowed the seeds of harvest, waiting for the moisture of the river water. The irrigation season arrived. However, seven dam sections happened to be located on the water inlets of the Tanglai Canal and Qin-Han Canal on the left and right banks. Therefore, irrigation and construction were like two opponents in a race, competing for a track and interfering with each other. To construct, a section of the canal must be destroyed and the canal mouth blocked with a cofferdam; to release water for irrigation, the cofferdam must be dismantled, six water-passing dam sections must be rushed out, the sluice gates must be rebuilt, and after the irrigation season, the dam foundation must be cleaned again and grass-soil cofferdams rebuilt, destroying the sluice gates. In this situation, the builders generously gave the best time of the year, from May to November, to their farmer brothers, while they carried out intense construction in the remaining five months. Therefore, the Qingtongxia builders understood the meaning of time even more. They did not calculate the hours of a day with twenty-four hours; they forgot the alternation of day and night; they had no concept of rest days and holidays. Many people squatted on the construction site day and night. When they were sleepy, they crawled into the tent, covered themselves with an old sheepskin coat and slept for a while; when they woke up, they put on the old sheepskin coat and went back to work on the construction site. Some people even didn't leave the construction site for several months, so busy that they sometimes forgot to get a haircut and shave. Although the leaders repeatedly advised: "Pay attention to rest, the Qingtongxia Dam cannot be built in one morning." But they humorously replied: "We just want to build it in one morning! Less rest, completing the task ahead of schedule is our greatest pleasure."

		High-Speed Plan

	However, how could nature understand the builders' urgent mood? It always set up many obstacles, attempting to hold back people's progress. In Qingtongxia, serious underground seepage was encountered at the beginning, followed by the discovery of four large faults on the left and right banks, and the seepage and faults were intertwined. Many dams have been built in the world, but it is rare to encounter so many faults in a power station. Because faults are the rocks that are broken during crustal movement, they are the weakest and most broken in the entire stratum. Therefore, the technical treatment of faults has always been a complex technical problem in water conservancy construction. In our country, the study of faults has only been around for two or three years. Since March 1959, people at the construction site have been engaged in a serious struggle around this issue. The focus of the struggle was how deep the faults should be excavated. Some people, based on the theories and experiences adopted by the United States in building the Shasta Dam in 1940, formulated a set of plans. According to this plan, the entire project would be postponed to 1962. The high-speed development of industry and agriculture and the continued leap forward situation in the autonomous region required the completion of the Qingtongxia project as soon as possible. The Party Committee of the Qingtongxia Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau fully recognized this situation, and with a spirit of bold innovation, proceeded from the actual situation, carried out anti-rightist learning, and absorbed the successful experience of Danjiangkou in handling faults, plus the help of Soviet experts, formulated a new treatment plan. Compared with the original design plan, it reduced the excavation volume by more than 90%, saved nearly two million yuan in investment, and more importantly, gained more than two years of time.

	The new plan was supported by the broad masses of Hui and Han workers. With their tenacious labor and the spirit of daring to think and dare to act, they created a miracle of conquering seepage and overcoming faults. We will always remember those fighting days and nights.

	It was still Chinese New Year's Eve this year. In the foundation pit covered by warm sheds, people were fighting the final battle with the faults. At this time, all the seepage water had gathered in the faults, and the foundation pit was in danger of being flooded at any time. Therefore, the drainage volume must be equal to the seepage volume, and the water pump was not allowed to stop for a second. Concrete pouring could not be delayed for a moment either. In that narrow foundation pit, hundreds of workers of a dozen different types had to work simultaneously. People used a wall made of concrete to force all the water to one side of the foundation pit. Twenty-three water pumps, one next to the other, were constantly running, lifting 0.7 cubic meters of water per second, more than six meters high, and sending it outside the foundation pit. On the overhanging trestle above, cars ran back and forth, pouring the concrete rapidly into the last section of the fault through suspended chutes.

	Such a fierce battle is commonplace for the Qingtongxia builders. Since the end of 1958, for four hundred days, the pumping team has been in a tense state of "competing for seconds and seizing inches" with water at all times, while the laborers stood in the water almost every day and every shift, excavating the faults bit by bit like gnawing bones. In the cold night of minus twenty degrees, Wang Xianzhang and Chang Baoxing, workers from Sanmenxia, and many laborers took off their clothes and rushed into the deep water to repair the pumping faucet. In order to concentrate the seepage water and attack the faults fiercely, the wind drill workers accepted the arduous task of excavating the sump wells. They tied a rope around their waists, stepped on the rocks, pressed the wind drill against their chests, and dug wells five or six meters deep under the riverbed. No matter how great the difficulty was, it could not scare the heroes of Qingtongxia. They issued the bold statement of "Treading through the earth and breaking through the sky, transforming the Yellow River and moving mountains," and finally drained more than 30 million cubic meters of seepage water (equivalent to half the storage capacity of the Ming Tombs Reservoir) in fourteen months, and used steel chisels and picks to gnaw out four large faults with a total width of about 40 meters, so that the dam layer excavation and concrete pouring projects could proceed normally.

		The Yellow Dragon Submits

	Now, the Yellow River is still frozen for thousands of miles, but the Qingtongxia construction site is steaming hot and full of spring. People pushed tons and tons of stones into the raging Yellow River, and the river surface became narrower and narrower. On February 24th, with a loud noise, the last huge block of concrete was embedded in the closure gap, and the Yellow River, which had been difficult to tame for thousands of years, was cut off for the fifth time. In the cheers of the people, the builders once again made a new guarantee to the Party: to hold the red flag of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward even higher, to complete the Qingtongxia Water Conservancy Hub Project half a year ahead of schedule, and to benefit the Hui and Han people of Ningxia as soon as possible!

    破坚冰腰斩黄河
    谢石言　张智楚
      十小时结束战斗
    封冻了的黄河，咋一看，那样平静、那样驯顺，像冬眠的巨蟒。但是，这里却躲藏着一股可怕的力量。当合龙逼近的时刻，河水猛涨一米左右，几公里以外的冰层就会突然撕裂，湍急的河水，挟带着近百吨重的冰块直冲而下，它可以在瞬息之间，摧毁整个截流围堰，挣断套在它脖子上的绳索。
    那么，推迟一个月，等冰融化了再截流，不是省劲得多吗？但是，我们的建设者们，对于时间是十分吝啬的，仅仅为了争得一个月的时间，他们宁愿付出双倍的精力。因为，争得一个月的时间就可以提前开挖第二期基坑工程，为今年提前灌溉、提前发电争得主动权。
    截流现场，充满了创造精神。从2月9日开始，几万包炸药，把龙口上下四、五百米范围里的六万平方米的冰层崩得粉碎，两岸山头上，已架起四门山炮，随时准备轰击上游冲下的巨大冰块，老河工指挥着人们拨动小块的冰凌，让它顺利通过龙口和底孔，流下来的巨大冰块也被人们打了窟窿，用钢丝绳拴在木桩上……。人们仅仅用了十个小时，就斩断了黄河，这是什么样的气魄，什么样的风格。
    冰期截流的壮举，一下子就让人清楚地看到青铜峡建设者的精神面貌。然而英雄们气壮山河的惊人事迹又何止这一件！在开挖坝基中，他们遇到水利建设中少有的坝基破碎、复盖层厚、断层多而大，地下渗水严重等复杂的地质情况。基坑和断层像一个永不枯竭的池塘，使施工者没有立足之地。但是，建设者们知道：宁夏几百万回、汉族人民正举目凝望青铜峡！二千年来，我们的祖先就已利用黄河水流的坡度，从青铜峡引水灌溉，著名的唐徕渠，秦、汉渠像乳管一样，抚育了整个的银川平原，使这里博得了“天下黄河富宁夏”的美誉。但是，老天爷并不想给宁夏人民特别的恩赐。由于河水没有控制，不仅灌溉没有保证，而且每年还要付出四十五万个工日清淤；更严重的是枯水年间，渠道没水，人们只得去求神。记得在那些严重干旱的日子里，连种在峡谷口一带的谷子，旱得都能燃着，而整个银川平原，赤地千里，半农半牧区的羊只，成群成群的倒毙在荒野里。所以，这里又流传着另外一句话：“没有灌溉，就没有农业，没有农业，就没有宁夏”。回、汉族人民早就渴望在青铜峡建起一道拦河大坝，把黄河的水完全掌握在自己的手里。
    大跃进的战鼓，急催青铜峡水利工程上马。
    逼使黄河交出阵地
    刚开工不久，冬季就来临了，封冻期愈逼愈近。工程局党委决定在这第一个冬天，就打出一个高速度建设青铜峡的跃进局面，要求在流冰前，逼使黄河让出半个河谷，交出阵地，以便马上进行坝基开挖，保证第一期工程提前完成。按照一般的施工经验，大都采用砂石围堰或木笼围堰，但是，这里没有车辆运输砂石，也没有木材制作木笼，更重要的是没有更多的时间。于是，他们就大胆地运用了宁夏回、汉族人民千百年以来丰富的治水经验，第一次把草土堆筑在黄河干流上，作为挡水建筑物。尽管河水一次又一次地把整块整块的草土混合体冲走，而党委书记，工程局长，却站在那即将冲垮的草土混合体上，指挥着人们把成捆成捆的麦草和一车一车的泥土倾倒在河里。草土老技工和土专家吃在工地，住在工地，站在最前沿进行最复杂的操作。十几艘大帆船，满装麦草，从银川平原各公社日夜兼程，赶到工地。就这样，仅仅用了一个多月的时间，经过六次失败，围堰终于合龙了。五百多米长、十六米宽的草土围堰，屹立在两丈多深的黄河激流中，保证了冬季的坝基开挖。
    春天，银川平原苏醒了，社员们播下了丰收的种子，等待着河水的湿润。灌溉期来临了。但是有七个坝段正好座落在左右两岸唐徕渠，秦、汉渠的引水口上，所以，灌溉和施工像赛跑中的两个对手，在争夺一条跑道，互相干扰着。要施工，必须破坏一段渠道，用围堰堵死渠口；要放水灌溉，就必须拆除围堰，抢浇出六个过水坝段，重修闸门，灌溉期结束后，还要再次清理坝基，修筑草土围堰，毁掉闸门。而建设者在这种情况下，毫不吝啬地把5月至11月一年中最好的时光让给了农民兄弟，自己却在剩下的五个月时间里，进行着紧张的施工。因此，青铜峡建设者更懂得时间的意义。他们不是用二十四小时计算一天的时辰；他们忘记了白天和黑夜的交替；他们没有休息日和假日的观念。许多人成天累月地蹲在工地。困了，就钻进帐篷，蒙上老羊皮袄睡一会；醒了，就把老羊皮袄一披，到工地上又干了起来。有些人甚至几个月没离开工地一步，忙得有时把理发和刮胡子都忘了。尽管领导人员一再劝说：“要注意休息呵，青铜峡大坝不是一个早晨能建好的”。可是他们却风趣地回答：“我们就是想在一个早晨建好它！少休息一点，提前完成任务，是我们最大的快乐。”
        高速度的方案
    然而，大自然那能理解建设者的这种迫切心情？总是设下重重障碍，企图拖住人们前进的脚步。在青铜峡，一开始就碰到了严重的地下渗水，紧接着又在左右两岸发现四条大断层，而渗水和断层又搅合在一起。世界上已修建的大坝很多，但是在一个电站碰到这样多的断层却是少见的。因为断层是地壳震动时被挫断的岩石，它在整个岩层中最软弱和破碎。因此，断层的技术处理向来是水利建设中一项复杂的技术问题。在我国研究断层，还只有两三年的历史。从1959年3月以来，工地上的人们围绕着这个问题进行过一场严肃的斗争。斗争的焦点是断层要挖深多少。有些人依据美国在1940年修建夏斯达坝等所采用的理论和经验，制定了一套方案，按照这个方案，整个工程就将推迟到1962年。自治区工农业的高速度发展和继续跃进的形势要求赶快建成青铜峡工程。中共青铜峡水利工程局委员会充分地认识到这个形势，以大胆革新的精神，从实际情况出发，开展了反右倾学习，又吸取了丹江口处理断层的成功经验，再加上苏联专家的帮助，制定了新的处理方案，和原来的设计方案相比，减少了开挖量90％以上，节约投资近二百万元，而更主要的是赢得了两年多的时间。
    新方案得到广大回、汉族职工的拥护。他们以顽强的劳动和敢想、敢干的精神，创造了征服渗水，攻克断层的奇迹。我们永远记着那些战斗的日日夜夜。
    还是今年旧历除夕，暖棚复盖着的基坑里，人们正在与断层进行最后的争夺战。这时，所有的渗水都汇集在断层里了，基坑随时都有被淹没的危险。因此，排水量必须等于渗水量，抽水机一分一秒也不允许停止。混凝土浇筑也不能拖延片刻。在那狭窄的基坑里，十几个不同工种的几百名工人，又必须同时动作。人们用混凝土打起的一道墙，把水全部逼到基坑的一边，二十三台抽水机，一台紧挨着一台，不停地转动，每秒钟把零点七公方的水，扬起六丈多高，送到基坑外面。上面的栈桥上，汽车来回奔跑，把混凝土通过悬空溜槽，急速地倾泻入断层的最后一段。
    像这样的激战，对于青铜峡建设者，已是常事。从1958年年底以来，整整四百多天，抽水队员每时每刻都处在与水“争分秒、夺寸土”的紧张状态中，而民工几乎每天每班都站在水中，像啃骨头似地一点一点地开挖断层。在零下二十多度的寒夜里，来自三门峡的工人王宪章、常宝兴和许多民工，脱下衣服，争先恐后的跳入深水，抢修抽水龙头。为了集中渗水，猛攻断层，风钻工们接受了开挖积水井的艰巨任务。他们腰拴一绳，脚蹬岩石，胸压风钻，在河床下五、六丈深的地方挖井。再大的困难吓不倒青铜峡的英雄汉，他们发出了“踏破地球冲破天，改造黄河搬走山”的豪言壮语，终于在十四个月里排出三千多万公方渗水（相当于半个十三陵水库的蓄水量），用钢钎和洋镐啃出了总宽度约四十米的四条大断层，使得坝层开挖和混凝土浇筑工程正常进行。
          黄龙俯首
    现在，黄河依然冰封千里，青铜峡工地却是热气腾腾，春意浓郁。人们把成吨成吨的石块推进了暴跳如雷的黄河，河面越逼越窄了。2月24日，一声巨响，最后一块巨大的混凝土块嵌进龙口，千年难驯的黄河第五次被拦腰斩断了。在人们的欢呼声中，建设者们又向党提出了新的保证：把总路线、大跃进的红旗举得更高，提前半年建成青铜峡水利枢纽工程，早日为宁夏回、汉人民造福！
