Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The 17th National Student Congress of the All-China Students' Federation, lasting seven days, victoriously concluded this afternoon. The congress called upon all students nationwide to recognize the great future of communism, arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, establish a proletarian worldview, and cultivate a communist attitude towards labor, learning, and communist moral character. It called for the persistence in participating in physical labor, studying diligently, and conducting scientific research, in order to make beneficial contributions to the cause of socialism and communism.

Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, delivered a report at the meeting today entitled "Arm Ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought." Hu Yaobang urged the vast number of young students to actively study Mao Zedong Thought. He said that the reason we prominently emphasize the study of Mao Zedong Thought is because it is the guide for our country to victoriously carry out socialist revolution and socialist construction, and it is a major development of Marxism-Leninism under new historical conditions. He said that studying Mao Zedong Thought is the most fundamental issue related to cultivating youth into successors to the cause of communism, and it will play a great and decisive role in enhancing the political and ideological consciousness of youth, establishing a proletarian worldview, and the sound development of their entire lives. Therefore, the vast number of students should regard studying Mao Zedong Thought as their major political task, launch a high tide of studying Mao Zedong's works, and be determined to arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought.

Hu Yaobang also pointed out that the vast number of young people must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to understand and analyze some major current international and domestic issues. He said that using Mao Zedong Thought to understand and analyze the current international situation, the issue of socialist construction in our country, the issue of the Party's education policy, and to understand and analyze oneself is of great significance.

In his report, Hu Yaobang also focused on the issue of developing communist spirit. He said that in recent years, the youth of our country have followed the Party wholeheartedly, listened to Chairman Mao's words, and advanced towards the bright road of communism; they do not talk about conditions in their work, do not calculate rewards in their labor, and demonstrate a noble communist style; in work and study, they "step forward when encountering difficulties, yield when encountering honor, learn from the advanced, and help the backward." This communist spirit has enabled the vast number of young people in our country to play an active role in high-speed socialist construction, and it is also an important condition for transitioning to a communist society in the future.

Hu Yaobang encouraged the students not to fail the expectations of the Party and the motherland, resolutely implement the Party's education policy, boost their energy, study modestly, rely on the leadership of the Party, and with the indomitable will to overcome all difficulties, strive to climb the peak of science and culture, become a member of the motherland's theoretical and scientific and technological army, and be good students of Mao Zedong who are both red and expert.

Hu Qili, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, delivered the closing speech, saying: During the congress, the Party Central Committee gave us extremely valuable instructions. The Party and Chairman Mao's infinite care and ardent expectations for our young generation are the great driving force for our continuous progress. Let us solemnly assure the Party and Chairman Mao that we will resolutely listen to the Party's instructions and teachings, strive to study Mao Zedong Thought, under the glorious banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and under the guidance of the Party's education policy, recognize the great future of communism, establish a proletarian worldview, study diligently, work actively, carry out scientific research, and become a working-class intellectual who is both red and expert, and contribute all of our youth, wisdom, and strength to rapidly building our country into a strong socialist power!

The congress discussed and adopted: the Constitution of the All-China Students' Federation and the Resolutions of the 17th National Student Congress of the All-China Students' Federation, and elected the 17th Committee of the All-China Students' Federation.

During the congress, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of

    青年学生们，做又红又专的好学生
    用毛泽东思想武装起来
    全国学代会胜利闭幕通过学联章程和大会决议
    新华社10日讯　中华全国学生第十七届代表大会，历时七天，今天下午胜利闭幕。大会号召：全国学生要认清共产主义远大前途，以毛泽东思想武装自己，树立无产阶级世界观，培养共产主义的劳动态度、学习态度和共产主义的道德品质。要坚持参加体力劳动，刻苦读书，开展科学研究。为社会主义、共产主义事业作出有益的贡献。
    共青团中央第一书记胡耀邦今天在会上作了题为“用毛泽东思想武装起来”的报告。胡耀邦要求广大青年学生积极学习毛泽东思想，他说，我们之所以突出地提出要学习毛泽东思想，因为它是我国胜利地进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的指针，它是马克思列宁主义在新的历史条件下的重大发展。他说，学习毛泽东思想，是关系到培养青年成为共产主义事业接班人的最根本的问题，它对于提高青年的政治思想觉悟，树立无产阶级世界观和一生的健全发展都将起着伟大的决定性的作用。因此，广大学生应当把学习毛泽东思想作为自己的重大的政治任务，掀起一个学习毛泽东著作的热潮，下决心用毛泽东思想武装自己。
    胡耀邦还指出：广大青年必须要以毛泽东思想为武器，来认识和分析当前国际国内的一些重大问题。他说，用毛泽东思想来认识和分析当前的国际局势、我国的社会主义建设问题、党的教育方针的问题，以及用来认识分析自己，是有重大的意义的。
    胡耀邦在报告中还着重谈到了发扬共产主义精神的问题。他说，几年来，我国青年一心一意地跟着党走，听毛主席的话，向着共产主义的光明大道前进；他们工作不讲条件，劳动不计报酬，表现出高尚的共产主义风格；他们在工作和学习上是“见困难就上，见荣誉就让，见先进就学，见后进就帮”。这种共产主义精神，使我国广大青年能够在高速度的社会主义建设中发挥了积极的作用，它也是将来过渡到共产主义社会的一个重要条件。
    胡耀邦勉励同学们不要辜负党和祖国的期望，坚决贯彻党的教育方针，要鼓足干劲，虚心学习，依靠党的领导，以冲破万难的顽强意志，努力攀登科学文化的高峰，成为祖国理论与科学技术大军中的一员，做又红又专的毛泽东的好学生。
    中华全国学生联合会主席胡启立致闭幕词说：大会期间，党中央给了我们极其宝贵的指示，党和毛主席对我们青年一代的无限关怀和殷切期望，是我们不断前进的伟大动力。让我们庄严地向党、向毛主席保证，我们一定坚决听从党的指示和教导，努力学习毛泽东思想，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉旗帜下，在党的教育方针的指导下，认清共产主义的远大前途，树立无产阶级世界观，刻苦读书、积极劳动，开展科学研究，作一个又红又专的工人阶级知识分子，为把我国迅速建成社会主义强国而贡献出自己的全部青春、智慧和力量！
    大会讨论和通过：中华全国学生联合会章程和中华全国学生第十七届代表大会决议，推选出了中华全国学生联合会第十七届委员会。
    大会期间，中共中央副主席、中华人民共和国主席刘少奇同志以及党和国家其他领导同志接见了出席会议的代表。党中央的深切关怀，给到会代表极大的鼓舞。大会听取中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理陈毅同志的报告，中共中央宣传部副部长周扬关于“目前形势和共产主义教育问题”的报告，国家计划委员会副主任王光伟“关于国家经济形势”的报告，共青团中央第一书记胡耀邦“用毛泽东思想武装起来”的报告。
    在大会上，共有五十位代表和四位特邀代表作了口头和书面的发言。大会期间，全国各地同学、教师向大会寄来了大量的贺信、贺电，有的学校同学还送来自己劳动生产的产品。在今天闭幕会上，刚从苏联回到北京的徐学惠转达了苏联学生、青少年对中国学生和青少年的亲切问好。
