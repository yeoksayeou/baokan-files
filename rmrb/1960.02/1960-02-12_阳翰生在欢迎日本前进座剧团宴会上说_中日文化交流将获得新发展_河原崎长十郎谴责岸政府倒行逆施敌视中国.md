Xinhua News Agency, 11th -- The Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries held a banquet this evening to warmly welcome Kawataki Chojuro, head of the Japanese Zenshinza Theater Troupe, deputy head Nakamura Kanyaemon, Miyakawa Gasei, and all the artists of the troupe.

Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity, Yang Hansheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Assocation for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Japanese peace activist Kinkazu Saionji, and Korean peace activist Hwang Bong-koo in Beijing attended the banquet.

Yang Hansheng spoke at the banquet, welcoming the Japanese friends. He said that the Zenshinza Theater Troupe overcame various difficulties to come to China for a visit and performance. This great and joyous event marks a glorious victory for the Sino-Japanese friendship movement and a new development in Sino-Japanese cultural exchange.

He said that the Zenshinza Theater Troupe has traveled an extraordinary road in the thirty years since its establishment, breaking through various obstacles and consistently defending the position of progressive drama. It has made significant contributions to maintaining and promoting Japanese national traditional art.

He said that the people of China and Japan have a traditional friendship and cultural connection spanning two thousand years. Although the Kishi Nobusuke group has concluded a military alliance treaty with the United States, continues to adhere to hostility towards China, and hinders the establishment of normal relations between China and Japan, the traditional friendship between the people of China and Japan can never be undermined by a small handful of reactionaries. Our gathering here today with friends from the Zenshinza Theater Troupe is the best proof of this.

He said that the people of China and Japan both have a strong desire for Sino-Japanese friendship. Any conspiracy by Kishi Nobusuke and American imperialism absolutely cannot shake the firm will of the people of China and Japan. We firmly believe that, through arduous struggle, the Japanese people and the Japanese literary and artistic circles will certainly be able to overcome all the man-made obstacles on the road forward and realize the aspirations for Japanese independence, peace, and neutrality. The Chinese people resolutely continue to support the great and just struggle of the Japanese people until they achieve final victory!

Yang Hansheng concluded by saying that the visit of our friends provides us with a very valuable opportunity for observation and learning. Through this friendly contact, Sino-Japanese cultural and artistic exchanges will achieve new development, and the unity and friendship between the people of China and Japan will be further consolidated and strengthened.

Head of the troupe Kawataki Chojuro, in his speech, first expressed his respect for the achievements made by the united Chinese people, under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, in their great socialist construction.

The head of the troupe said that the Japanese people, with a motherly heart, sent their own diligently cultivated children as artistic envoys representing Japan to visit and perform in China.

The head of the troupe said that the people of China and Japan have already formed a brotherly friendship. However, the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, in violation of the will of the Japanese people who love peace, strive for independence, and urgently hope for neutrality, is pursuing a policy of hostility towards China and has signed a new "Security Treaty." This is a retrogressive policy. It will certainly be buried by the strength of the people of both countries.

The head of the troupe said that, in the thirty years since its establishment, the Zenshinza Theater Troupe has broken away from the commercial theatrical forms of Japan and achieved complete independence. It has striven for the development of Japanese progressive culture and has worked tirelessly to defend Japanese national drama and further develop it into the drama of today.

The head of the troupe said that in the past, during difficult times, we always took the tenacious, courageous, and heroic deeds of the liberated Chinese friends, headed by Chairman Mao, as an example to carry out the activities of the theater troupe. In the future, we will continue to unite and cultivate our difficult cause, and make beneficial contributions to the friendship between the people of Japan and China, to the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, and to the defense of world peace.

Also attending tonight's reception were well-known figures in literary and art circles such as Tian Han, Ouyang Yuqian, Lü Ji, Ma Shaobo, Wu Xue, and Ouyang Shanzun.

    阳翰生在欢迎日本前进座剧团宴会上说
    中日文化交流将获得新发展
    河原崎长十郎谴责岸政府倒行逆施敌视中国
    新华社11日讯　中国人民对外文化协会今晚举行宴会，热烈欢迎日本前进座剧团团长河原崎长十郎、副团长中村翫右卫门、宫川雅青和剧团的全体艺术家们。
    中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志、中国人民对外文化协会副会长阳翰笙、在京的日本和平人士西园寺公一、朝鲜和平人士黄凤九等，都出席了宴会。
    阳翰笙在宴会上讲话欢迎日本朋友。他说，前进座剧团克服了种种困难，来到我国进行访问演出，这件大好的喜事，标志着中日友好运动的光辉胜利和中日文化交流新的发展。
    他说，前进座剧团成立三十年来，走过了一段不平常的道路，冲破了各种障碍，始终坚守着进步的戏剧事业的阵地。对于保持和发扬日本民族传统艺术方面，作出了重大的贡献。
    他说，中日两国人民有着两千年的传统友谊和文化联系。尽管岸信介集团同美国缔结了军事同盟条约，继续坚持敌视中国，阻碍中日两国建立正常关系，但是中日两国人民传统的友谊决不是一小撮反动派所能破坏的。今天我们同前进座剧团的朋友们在这里欢聚一堂，这就是最好的证明。
    他说，中日两国人民都有着要求中日友好的强烈愿望，岸信介和美帝国主义的任何阴谋诡计，绝对动摇不了中日两国人民这种坚强的意志。我们深信，日本人民和日本文艺界经过艰苦的奋斗，一定能够克服前进道路上一切人为的障碍，实现日本独立、和平、中立的愿望。中国人民坚决继续支持日本人民这一伟大的正义斗争，直到获得最后的胜利！
    阳翰笙最后说，这次朋友们来访，对我们是一个十分宝贵的观摩和学习的机会。通过这次友好接触，将使中日两国文化艺术交流得到新的发展，中日两国人民的团结和友谊得到进一步的巩固和加强。
    河原崎长十郎团长在讲话中首先向在以伟大的毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党的领导下、团结起来的中国人民在进行伟大的社会主义建设事业中所获得的成就表示敬意。
    团长说，日本人民怀着母亲般的心情，欢送他们自己辛勤培养出来的儿女作为代表日本的艺术使节，来中国进行访问演出。
    团长说，中日两国人民已经结成了兄弟般的友情。但是岸信介内阁，违背了爱好和平、争取独立、迫切希望中立的日本国民的意志，推行敌视中国的政策，签订了新的“安全条约”，这是倒行逆施的政策。它一定会被两国人民的力量埋葬掉的。
    团长说，前进座剧团成立的三十年来，摆脱了日本商业性的戏剧形式，取得了完全的独立，它为日本进步文化的发展而奋斗，为保卫日本民族的戏剧并进一步使它发展为今天的戏剧而不断努力。
    团长说，我们过去在困难的年代里，总是以毛主席为首的、解放了的中国朋友们的坚韧、勇敢、英雄的事迹，作为榜样，来开展剧团的活动。今后，我们将继续团结一致地培育我们困难的事业，并为日中两国人民的友好、为恢复日中邦交和为保卫世界和平作出有益的贡献。
    出席今晚招待会的还有文艺界著名人士田汉、欧阳予倩、吕骥、马少波、吴雪、欧阳山尊等多人。
