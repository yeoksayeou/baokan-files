    Realizing River Network Construction for Great Increase in Grain Production
    Fuyang County People Completely Change Poverty-Stricken Conditions
    (Our Dispatch) The people of Fuyang County, Anhui Province, have basically completed the construction of a river network. The broad masses of this county, in constructing the river network project, launched a high-efficiency movement, fighting hard through three winters and two springs. Up to now, the county has formed a relatively complete river network system with crisscrossing rivers and canals, capable of storing an average of more than 200,000 cubic meters of water per square kilometer, reaching the standard of basically realizing river network construction.
    According to historical records, before liberation, Fuyang County suffered from floods and droughts on average once every two years, with an average grain yield of only about 100 jin per mu, and the people lived in extreme poverty. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the people of Fuyang County actively built water conservancy projects, completing a total of more than 380 million cubic meters of earth and stone work. The construction of these water conservancy projects laid the foundation for the county to realize river network construction, greatly enhancing the ability to resist natural disasters and powerfully promoting the development of agricultural production. The county's average grain yield per mu in 1959 had already achieved the targets stipulated in the National Programme for Agricultural Development ahead of schedule. Rice production achievements were even more remarkable.
    Last winter, the Fuyang County Party Committee formulated a plan to basically realize river network construction ahead of schedule this spring, to ensure the safety of dikes and dams in the event of floods like those of 1954, to avoid waterlogging in the event of heavy rains like those of 1956, and to avoid drought in the event of droughts like those of 1959.
    In order to quickly realize this grand river network construction plan, as soon as the water conservancy movement began last winter, Party committees at all levels throughout the county actively strengthened leadership, ensuring that every area had a commander and every sector had a general. Ideological and political work was done well, greatly inspiring the enthusiasm and the spirit of inquiry of the masses. The county Party committee also used the characteristics of the people's communes – being large in scale and having a high degree of public ownership – to achieve comprehensive planning and unified arrangements. The county excavated eight large backbone rivers between communes, four hundred medium and small rivers between brigades, and six thousand four hundred channels. This linked up some previously scattered and isolated projects, forming a relatively complete irrigation system on the county's 2,575 square kilometers of land. In the construction of large-scale water conservancy projects, the county uniformly allocated the labor force of each commune under the principle of equivalent exchange, ensuring the completion of key projects (Fulin River, Futai River, Fuwo River, and other large rivers) as scheduled. In water conservancy construction, there was a vigorous campaign to reform water control tools and a vigorous mass movement for high efficiency. At the beginning of the water conservancy movement last winter, more than 6,400 iron and wood workers from more than 300 machinery factories and farm implement factories in the communes went all out, working day and night to rush to manufacture advanced water control tools. The mass high-efficiency movement, centered on tool reform, rose one wave higher than another. Among the more than 130,000 newly made and reformed advanced water control tools in the county, there were more than 35,000 tools with an average daily efficiency of 30 to 100 cubic meters of earthwork, reaching the point where every two water control laborers had one advanced tool. The county's average daily efficiency rapidly increased from 3.2 cubic meters at the beginning of construction to 22 cubic meters (the full-month average for January this year). As a result, the county's original plan to complete the task of more than 186 million cubic meters of earth and stone work in one winter and spring was completed ahead of schedule on January 7 this year.
    At present, the broad masses of the people of Fuyang County are determined to work hard again this spring and increase the amount of earthwork by 186 million cubic meters.

    实现河网化粮食大增产
    阜阳县人民彻底改变贫困面貌
    本报讯　安徽省阜阳县已经基本上实现河网化。这个县的广大群众，在兴修河网工程中，开展高工效运动，奋战三冬两春，到目前为止，全县形成了河渠纵横的比较完整的河网系统，平均每平方公里已能蓄水二十万立方米以上，达到了基本实现河网化的标准。
    据历史记载，解放前阜阳县平均每两年即有一次水旱灾害，平均粮食亩产量只有一百斤左右，群众生活极端贫苦。解放后，阜阳县人民在党的领导下积极兴修水利，总计做土石方三亿八千多万立方米。这些水利工程的兴建，奠定了全县实现河网化的基础，大大增强了抗御自然灾害的能力，有力地促进了农业生产的发展。全县1959年粮食平均亩产量，已提前实现了农业发展纲要规定的指标。水稻生产成就更加显著。
    中共阜阳县委去冬制定了要在今春提前基本实现河网化的规划，以保证在遇到1954年型洪水的情况下，确保堤防安全，在遇到1956年型的大雨的情况下不受涝，在遇到1959年型旱灾的情况下不受旱。
    为了迅速实现这个宏伟的河网化规划，去冬水利运动一开始，全县各级党委就积极加强领导，做到块块有帅，片片有将，政治思想工作做得好，大大鼓舞了群众的干劲和钻劲。县委还运用人民公社一大二公的特点，做到了全面规划，统一安排。全县开挖了公社与公社之间的大型骨干河道八条，大队与大队之间的中小型河道四百条，渠道六千四百条。这样便把过去一些分散孤立的工程联结起来，使全县二千五百七十五平方公里的土地上，形成一个比较完整的灌溉系统。在兴修大型水利工程中，全县在等价交换的原则下，统一调配各社的劳力，保证了骨干工程（阜临河、阜太河、阜涡河等大型河道）如期完成。在兴修水利中，大搞治水工具改革，大搞群众性的高工效运动。去冬水利运动一开始，各公社共三百多个机械厂、农具厂的六千四百多名铁木工，便全力以赴，日夜赶制治水先进工具。群众性的以工具改革为中心的高工效运动，一浪高过一浪。全县新制和改制的各种先进治水工具十三万多件中，每日平均工效在三十立方米到一百立方米土方的工具有三万五千多件，已达到每两个治水劳力有一件先进工具。全县平均日工效由开工初期的三点二立方米，迅速增加到二十二立方米（今年1月份全月平均）。这样，使该县原计划要在一个冬春完成的一亿八千六百多万立方米土石方工程任务，到今年元月7日就提前完成。
    目前，阜阳县广大人民，决心再大干一春，增做一亿八千六百万立方米土方。
