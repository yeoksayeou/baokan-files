Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 1st: According to a statement released here tonight, the government of the German Democratic Republic sent notes to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on January 29th, strongly protesting the continued provocative activities of West Germany in West Berlin, and stating that it cannot remain indifferent to this.

The notes also expressed the hope that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, in accordance with the decision of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference that West Berlin is not a part of the Federal Republic, recognize the urgent necessity of resolving the West Berlin issue.

These notes were forwarded to the governments of the three Western powers through the Czechoslovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The notes listed the recent provocative activities carried out by West Germany in West Berlin, including the West German government's decision in September 1959 to establish a West German radio station in West Berlin, the West German Federal Council's meeting in West Berlin in October 1959, the convening of a so-called "Indivisible Germany" committee meeting in West Berlin in November 1959, and the current so-called "official" visit of West German President Lübke to West Berlin. The notes particularly pointed out that West German Chancellor Adenauer's recent statement in the West Berlin parliament was another step by the West German government in attempting to erase the rapprochement between East and West on the West Berlin issue achieved at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, and in hindering a positive resolution of the West Berlin issue.

The notes pointed out that the West German government's illegal actions on the West Berlin issue have deepened the tension and expanded the dangers arising from the unfortunate situation in West Berlin.

The notes said that the government of the German Democratic Republic believes that West Berlin becoming a free city would be an effective way to eliminate the atmosphere of an outpost city and enable West Germany and West Berlin to develop peacefully.

    德意志民主共和国政府照会美英法三国
    抗议西德方面在西柏林继续挑衅活动
    新华社柏林1日电　据这里今晚公布，德意志民主共和国政府1月29日照会美、英、法三国政府，坚决抗议西德方面在西柏林继续进行挑衅活动，并且表示不能对此置之不理。
    照会并希望美、英、法三国政府根据日内瓦外长会议关于西柏林不是联邦共和国一部分的决定，认识到解决西柏林问题的迫切必要性。
    这些照会是经由捷克斯洛伐克外交部转交给西方三国的政府的。
    照会列举了最近西德方面在西柏林进行的挑衅活动，其中包括西德政府1959年9月间决定在西柏林设置西德电台、西德联邦参议院1959年10月间在西柏林举行会议、1959年11月在西柏林召开所谓“不可分割的德国”委员会会议以及西德总统吕布克目前在西柏林进行的所谓“正式”访问。照会特别指出，西德总理阿登纳不久前在西柏林议会上所作的声明，是西德政府企图抹煞在日内瓦外长会议上所取得的东西方在西柏林问题上的立场上的接近、阻挠西柏林问题取得积极解决的又一个步骤。
    照会指出，西德政府在西柏林问题上的违法行为，已经加深了局势的紧张，并且扩大了由于西柏林的不幸形势所产生的危险。
    照会说，德意志民主共和国政府认为，西柏林成为一个自由城市，将是消除作为一个前哨城市的气氛和使西德及西柏林有可能和平发展的有效道路。
