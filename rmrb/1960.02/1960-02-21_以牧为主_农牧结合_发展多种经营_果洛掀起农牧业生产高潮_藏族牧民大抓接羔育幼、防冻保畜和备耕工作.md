Taking animal husbandry as the mainstay, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing diversified operations, Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture has launched a new upsurge in agricultural and animal husbandry production in the new spring. The broad masses of Tibetan herdsmen are vigorously grasping lambing and breeding, frost prevention and animal protection, and spring ploughing preparations such as water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, striving for a comprehensive leap forward in agricultural and animal husbandry production in 1960. The vast grasslands are bustling with activity, resounding with slogans such as "Achieving a Flying Start in the New Year," and good news is constantly pouring in from all directions.

In the current peak season for ewes lambing, one-third of the pregnant ewes in the prefecture have already given birth to more than 105,600 lambs. More than 160 ewes have given birth to twins or triplets in one birth, and the lamb survival rate has reached more than 96%, which is more than 20% higher than in previous years. The commune members are beaming with joy, carefully nurturing the lambs to grow quickly, strengthening care for the ewes about to give birth, and applying heat-induced estrus to the ewes after giving birth for breeding. Because the ewes are in good physical condition, the lambs born are not only strong, but also recover quickly after giving birth. In addition, with the use of artificial estrus induction methods, many ewes that have given birth are already in heat and ready to be bred. The prefecture plans to apply heat-induced breeding to 20% to 30% of the ewes that have given birth, so that they will give birth again this summer, promoting high-speed reproduction of sheep. At the same time, the communes have also strengthened the work of frost prevention, health care, and fetal protection for all kinds of large livestock. More than 3,850 livestock sheds have been built, and more than 9,370 pens have been built, and the original sheds and pens have been renovated, realizing that large livestock have pens and young livestock have sheds. Although it is still in the cold season, the first-class fatness of all kinds of livestock is still maintained above 95%.

Because the people's communes are very meticulous in the feeding and management of livestock, the livestock fatness in the autumn of last year was particularly good, and more than 70 million catties of supplementary feed and fodder were harvested and stored, so the livestock can spend the winter with full fatness. When the lambing season arrived, the communes properly arranged labor, fully prepared tools, added more than 1,230 lambing personnel, sewed more than 9,500 lambing bags, built more than 4,300 warm lambing sheds and warm beds, supplemented the ewes with concentrated feed, equipped the lambs with dairy cows, and the herdsmen took turns guarding the night, lambing as they were born. At present, there are still more than 200,000 ewes that will give birth in the next month. The communes are continuing to strengthen the manpower and material preparations for lambing and breeding and heat-induced breeding.

Recently, all the communes have organized professional agricultural production teams to actively prepare for the large-scale spring ploughing on the grasslands. More than 12,000 commune members in the prefecture braved the severe cold to rush to build water conservancy projects, advancing rapidly at a rate of expanding the irrigated area by more than 1,000 mu per day. At present, more than 690 canals have been completed, and more than 100,500 mu of water land has been expanded. Whether it is an animal husbandry production team or an agricultural production team, everyone is accumulating fertilizer, and has accumulated more than 21,000 catties of fertilizer for each mu of land, some of which has been transported to the fields. The communes have also run agricultural technology training classes, and the herdsmen are enthusiastically learning agricultural production technology; some communes are also training yaks to increase animal power for spring ploughing. As early as before the Spring Festival, the Shanggongma Commune in Gande County established a cattle training team, and transferred 200 yaks from the animal husbandry production team for training. Now these yaks, which used to only carry things, have learned how to plow and harrow the land. In the early days of liberation, there were only two small agricultural areas in Tongde County and Banma County in the Golog area. The herdsmen used wooden plows and cow horn plows to plow the land, and the cultivation methods were extremely backward. After communization in 1959, various crops were planted on a large area of wasteland, with more than 90,000 mu of wheat, highland barley, and rapeseed planted. Facts have proved that all six counties in the prefecture can grow crops, and many areas can also obtain high yields.

    以牧为主　农牧结合　发展多种经营
    果洛掀起农牧业生产高潮
    藏族牧民大抓接羔育幼、防冻保畜和备耕工作
    本报讯　根据以牧为主，农牧结合，发展多种经营的方针，果洛藏族自治州新春掀起农牧业生产高潮，广大藏族牧民大抓接羔育幼、防冻保畜和兴修水利、积造肥料等备耕工作，力争1960年牧农业生产全面大跃进。千里草原上热气腾腾，响彻着“实现新春开门红”的口号，到处捷报频传。
    在目前的母羊产羔旺季中，全州已有三分之一的怀孕母羊产羔十万五千六百多只，有一百六十多只母羊一胎产了双羔或三羔，羔羊成活率达到96％以上，比往年高出20％多。社员们喜气洋洋，一面精心抚育羊羔迅速成长，一面对临产母羊加强护理，一面给产后母羊热胎配种。由于母羊体质好，不仅生下的羔羊健壮，而且产后恢复快，加上采用了人工催情等办法，许多产羔母羊又已经发情待配。全州计划热配20％到30％的产羔母羊，在今年夏季再产羔一次，促使羊只高速度繁殖。与此同时，各公社还加强了各类大家畜的防冻保健保胎工作，共修畜棚三千八百五十多个，打圈九千三百七十多个，并整修了原有棚圈，实现了大畜有圈，幼畜有棚。现在虽在严寒季节，各类牲畜的一等膘仍然保持在95％以上。
    由于人民公社对牲畜的饲放管理十分细致，去年秋季的畜膘抓得特别好，又割储了七千多万斤补饲草料，所以牲畜能够满膘过冬。在产羔季节来到时，各公社妥善安排劳力，充分准备工具，共增添了接羔人员一千二百三十多人，缝制接羔袋九千五百多个，修建产羔暖棚、暖炕四千三百多个，并为母羊补饲了精料，为羔羊配备了奶牛，放牧员做到轮流守夜，随产随接。目前还有二十多万只母羊将要在近一个月内产羔，各公社对接羔育幼和热胎配种的人力和物资准备工作还在不断加强。
    最近，各个公社都组织了专业的农业生产队，积极准备迎接草原上大规模的春耕。全州一万二千多社员冒着严寒突击修建水利工程，以每天扩大灌溉面积一千多亩的速度快步前进。目前已完成渠道六百九十多条，扩大水地十万零五千多亩。不论是牧业生产队或是农业生产队，都人人动手积肥，已为每亩地积攒肥料两万一千多斤，其中一部分已运到地里。各公社还办了农业技术训练班，牧民们都踊跃学习农业生产技术；有的公社还在训练牦牛，给春耕增加畜力。甘德县上贡麻公社早在春节前就成立了一个驯牛队，从牧业生产队抽调了两百头牦牛来训练，现在这些过去只会驮运东西的牦牛已经学会犁地、耙地等农活了。果洛地区在解放初期，只有同德县和班玛县有两个小块农业区，牧民们用木犁和牛角犁地，耕作方法极为落后。公社化以后的1959年，大面积开荒试种各种农作物，共种植小麦、青稞、油菜九万多亩。事实证明，全州六个县都能种庄稼，许多地区还能获得高产。
