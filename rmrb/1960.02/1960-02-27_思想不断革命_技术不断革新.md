    Constantly Revolutionize Thinking, Continuously Innovate Technology
    With Politics in Command, Innovation Brings Universal Success
    On the 23rd, the Shaanxi Daily published news about the Xian People's Enamel Factory basically achieving mechanization and semi-mechanization, along with an editorial titled "The Path of the Great Revolution in Productivity," discussing the basic experiences of the Xian People's Enamel Factory in its technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Excerpts are as follows:
    The Xian People's Enamel Factory correctly applies Chairman Mao's theory of continuous revolution and the theory of revolutionary development stages to guide production reform. They can closely integrate technical innovation plans with the key production areas and weak links of each period, allowing the technical innovation movement to exert greater power in improving current production. At the same time, it creates a new foundation for the continuous improvement of the enterprise's overall technical level. The fact of this factory illustrates that each victory of technical innovation inspires the vast masses of workers and staff with a strong fighting spirit to innovate technology, prompting them to further believe in their own wisdom and strength. The fact is: the thought of continuous revolution creates new material and technical forces, and new material and technical forces, in turn, consolidate and enrich the thought of continuous revolution. Therefore, we can draw the following conclusion: red thought promotes red innovation, red innovation promotes red production; conversely, red production promotes red thought, red thought promotes red innovation, and red innovation promotes red production. This is the law of the cyclical and mutually promoting development of production and technical innovation. However, we must recognize that the ideological factor plays a decisive role in the mutually promoting relationship between thought, innovation, and production activities. Because the technical revolution and technical innovation themselves are a struggle between two lines: new and old, advanced and backward, revolutionary and conservative, scientific and superstitious, and achieving more, faster, better, and more economically versus achieving less, slower, worse, and more expensively. Therefore, we must adhere to the principle of putting politics in command, firmly establish the new historical tasks of technical innovation and technical revolution on the ideological foundation of continuous revolution and the theory of revolutionary stages, so that the movement can advance endlessly.
    With the guiding ideology of continuous revolution, there must also be correct lines and methods that are compatible with it. The Xian People's Enamel Factory's great achievements in achieving complete sets of innovations are because they not only armed the masses with the thought of continuous revolution, but also wholeheartedly relied on the masses. We know that the workers and staff are most familiar with production, understand the problems existing in production, and have rich operational and technical experience. Without their participation and without them as the main force, the technical innovation movement will be at a loss. Therefore, leaders of all enterprises must firmly establish the viewpoint of "relying on people to transform enterprises," place the hope of solving all problems in enterprises on the hands and wisdom of workers and staff, and implement this viewpoint into daily actions. Technical innovation is a mass movement, and we must pay great attention to every innovative suggestion of workers and staff, even if it is immature, imperfect, or minor. We must support it with full enthusiasm and sincerity. This is because every technical innovation is a new thing, and new things are often immature and imperfect in the initial stages. If we cannot stand on the side of new things at all times, nurture them and protect them like a loyal gardener cherishes seedlings, and create favorable conditions for their rapid growth and expansion, then it is not a thorough mass line, but a mass line that has been discounted. Therefore, whether or not the leaders of enterprises can support every innovative suggestion of the masses has become a touchstone for testing whether their implementation of the mass line is thorough.
    Under the guidance of the thought of continuous revolution, the leadership style and leadership methods of the Xian People's Enamel Factory have also been continuously improved with the progress of the movement. They established production relations that are compatible with the development of productive forces, ensuring the continuous improvement of the overall production level of the enterprise. The leading cadres of the Xian People's Enamel Factory have consistently gone deep into the front line of production, participating in production and leading production, fighting alongside the masses. This not only greatly encouraged the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers and staff, but more importantly, allowed the leaders themselves to directly grasp the production situation, knowing every aspect of production like the back of their hand, even every detail is very clear. Therefore, they can promptly grasp the key production areas and weak links, arrange the priorities of innovation, and grasp them in a detailed and segmented manner, truly achieving the goal of grasping the key points to drive the overall situation, linking one ring to another, with the key links leading to the overall improvement, and achieving complete sets of innovations. It is particularly worth mentioning that the leaders of the Xian People's Enamel Factory do not generally grasp the key points, but rather deeply understand the details of each key issue, find the focus of the contradiction, and combine with the workers, staff, and technical cadres to analyze and study the problem. In this way, they truly penetrate ideological work into the inner layers of production and technical activities, organically combining political work and economic work, making political work truly the soul of economic work, so that the problem can be solved quickly and well. When the production situation changes after the realization of major innovative suggestions, the Xian People's Enamel Factory can change the production process, adjust the labor organization, carry out technical training, formulate new operating procedures and production quotas, and establish new rules and regulations at the fastest speed according to actual needs, so that the enterprise management work can quickly keep up and consolidate the achievements of technical innovation in a timely manner. The improvement of business management and the improvement of interpersonal relationships, that is, the adaptation of production relations to the development of productive forces, in turn, promotes the continuous development of the technical innovation movement.
    Innovation is Endless, There is Always a Higher Level
    The Shanghai "Liberation" Semi-Monthly Magazine published a commentary in its fourth issue of 1960 entitled "New Development of Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution," excerpts are as follows:
    Currently, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement on Shanghai's industrial front is showing an encouraging new situation. The main aspects are: the broad masses have greater enthusiasm and higher zeal, demonstrating great initiative and pioneering spirit, and the movement has a wider mass character. The movement has developed from the innovation of general tools and operations to the realization of mechanization and semi-mechanization; from the innovation of general products to the creation of high-grade precision products and the tackling of cutting-edge technologies; from individuals engaging in technical innovation to the widespread organization of "three-way combinations" inside and outside enterprises.
    All of this shows that the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is moving towards a broader, deeper, and more sustained development path. Faced with the new situation of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the question of whether to continue to leap forward, and to leap forward better and more comprehensively, or to stop and no longer continue to leap forward, has been raised to every enterprise leader. The struggle between the two methods of achieving more, faster, better, and more economically versus achieving less, slower, worse, and more expensively will be reflected again in the new situation. Some people have a comparative method, which is to compare the old blueprints planned in the past with today's achievements, instead of comparing them with the grand blueprint of accelerating socialist construction and even the transition to communism; they only see the new technologies, new processes, and new equipment that have emerged, without opening their eyes to look at the most advanced levels already achieved at home and even in the world, so they feel satisfied and think that the leap forward can stop here. This comparison is like creating a cage for oneself and being content in a small world; as for the new bold words of the masses expressing new ambitions and the new initiatives of enthusiastically engaging in innovation outside the cage, they cannot be seen, or they are thought to be just the actions of a few people, a temporary creation. With this kind of thinking, of course, they cannot see the new situation that has emerged in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and they cannot see the tremendous changes taking place in the spiritual outlook of the working class. However, those who are full of energy adopt another comparative method, which is to look forward, not backward; to be based on reality and face the future, comparing today with tomorrow and the day after tomorrow; to jump out of the small circle of their own unit; and to compare with all the most advanced levels. With this comparison, the horizon suddenly opens up. The more you compare, the more nervous you feel. This nervousness is a good thing, breaking the tranquility of stagnation, making you feel that you must work harder and set lofty ambitions for continuous revolution. Seeing that there are always higher levels, and there is always a higher level in the sky, you become perceptive, and the new demands and new creations of the masses are all in sight, and you carefully pay attention to them, study them, and immediately start to promote them. The thoughts of the masses become the thoughts of the leaders, the leaders and the masses have the same goals, their feelings are in harmony, and their energy is twisted together, making it possible to promote continued leap forward. Two comparative methods will inevitably have two results.
    In such a new situation, to lead the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to a wider, deeper, and more lasting level, the movement must have an increasingly greater mass character. Therefore, in carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, attention should be paid to diversification, combining popularization and improvement, and walking on two legs, rather than just walking on one leg or one and a half legs. The implementation of the Party's general line of "walking on two legs" in enterprises is a guideline for correctly combining various factors of productive force development and fully exerting all its positive effects. Only in this way can the revolutionary enthusiasm and creative power of the broad masses be most fully mobilized. Neglecting any leg will inevitably lead to achieving less, slower, worse, and more expensively, and to a cold and desolate atmosphere.
    Therefore, on the one hand, we should actively develop high-grade precision and cutting-edge products urgently needed for national construction. In all enterprises with the conditions, this should be regarded as the main direction of production development, and we should strive to make greater achievements. On the other hand, we should also pay attention to improving the quality of general products and strive to reach the first-class level of similar products in the country. Only by grasping the former as the focus can we arm industry with the most advanced technology, create higher labor productivity, further meet the needs of national construction and people's lives, and provide direction for the improvement of general products. However, in order to develop high-grade precision and cutting-edge products, it is also necessary to greatly improve the quality and technical level of general products as a foundation. The improvement of the quality and technical level of general products will continuously provide new material and technical conditions for advancing towards high-grade precision and cutting-edge products. Therefore, the two cannot be separated, but rather promote each other and improve together.
    On the one hand, we should strive to adopt new technologies, new processes, and new equipment, change the backward state of manual operation, and strive to improve the degree of mechanization. Enterprises with the conditions should also advance towards automation. Only in this way can we transfer industry to a modern technical basis. But on the other hand, we cannot ignore starting from specific material and technical conditions, giving full play to the utilization rate of existing equipment, and attaching importance to the minor reforms of operating tools by the masses. We should adopt foreign methods if we can, and adopt indigenous methods if we cannot, or combine indigenous and foreign methods.
    Because the movement is developing rapidly, the innovative suggestions of the broad masses are increasing, advanced models are emerging in rows and formations, and advanced experiences and inventions are being created in complete sets, we are also required to systematically exchange advanced experiences through organized means, summarize them, and improve them, so that they become more complete experiences for promotion. In this way, we can systematize scattered technical experiences, allow the innovative experiences of individual departments to bloom universally in the entire industry and region, promote the comprehensive technical transformation of the entire enterprise and the entire industry, and continuously enrich and improve the advanced experiences in the process of being concentrated and then promoted.

### 思想不断革命　技术不断革新

    思想不断革命　技术不断革新
    政治挂了帅　革新满堂红
    23日的陕西日报发表了西安人民搪瓷厂基本实现机械化和半机械化的新闻，并发表了以“生产力大革命的途径”为题的社论，对西安人民搪瓷厂技术革新和技术革命运动的基本经验作了论述，摘要如下：
    西安人民搪瓷厂正确地把毛主席不断革命和革命发展阶段论的理论运用在指导生产改革中去，他们就能够把技术革新规划同每一个时期的生产关键、薄弱环节紧密结合起来，使技术革新运动在提高当前生产中发挥更大威力。同时为整个企业技术水平的不断提高，创造新的基础。这个厂的事实说明，技术革新的每一个胜利，又鼓舞了广大职工群众革新技术的旺盛斗志，促使职工群众更加相信自己的智慧和力量。事实是：不断革命的思想，创造了新的物质技术力量，新的物质技术力量，反过来又巩固与丰富了不断革命思想。因而我们可以得出这样一个结论：思想红，推动革新红，革新红，推动生产红；反过来生产红又推动思想红，思想红又推动革新红，革新红又推动了生产红。这是生产发展和技术革新循环往复、相互推动的规律。但是，我们必须认清：这种思想、革新、生产活动之间的相互推动关系，起决定作用的还是思想因素。因为技术革命和技术革新本身，就是一场新与旧、先进与落后、革命与保守、科学与迷信、多快好省与少慢差费的两条道路的斗争。所以，我们必须坚持政治挂帅的原则，把技术革新和技术革命的新的历史任务，巩固地建立在不断革命和革命阶段论的思想基础上，运动才能永无止境地阔步前进。
    有了不断革命的指导思想，还必须有与之相适应的正确路线和方法，西安人民搪瓷厂获得成套革新的巨大成就，就是因为他们不仅以不断革命的思想武装了群众，而且全心全意地依靠了群众。我们知道：职工群众最熟悉生产，了解生产中存在的问题，有丰富的操作、技术经验。没有他们的参加，不以他们为主力，技术革新运动就会一筹莫展。所以，一切企业的领导者，必须坚定地确立
  “改造企业依靠人”的观点，把解决企业一切问题的希望寄托于职工的双手和智慧，并把这个观点贯彻到日常的行动中去，技术革新是群众性的运动，必须十分重视职工的每一个革新建议，即或它是不成熟、不完善的、细小的，也必须满腔热情地、真心诚意地支持它，这是因为每一件技术革新，都是新生事物，而新生事物在开始阶段，往往又都是不成熟，不完善的。如果我们不能时时刻刻都站在新生事物这一边，像一个忠实的园丁爱护幼苗那样，培植它，保护它，给它创造迅速成长、壮大的有利条件，那就不是彻底的群众路线，而是打了折扣的群众路线。所以说，企业的领导者们是否能够作到支持群众的每一件革新建议，就成了考验他们执行群众路线彻底不彻底的试金石。
    在不断革命思想的指导下，西安人民搪瓷厂的领导作风和领导方法，也随着运动的进展有着不断的改进。他们建立了与生产力发展相适应的生产关系，保证了整个企业生产水平的不断提高。西安人民搪瓷厂的领导干部，一贯深入生产第一线，既参加生产，又领导生产，同群众战斗在一起，不仅大大鼓舞了工人群众的革命干劲，更重要的是领导者自己得以直接掌握生产情况，对生产中的每一个环节了若指掌，甚至每一个细节都很清楚，所以他们就能够及时抓住生产关键和薄弱环节，安排革新的轻重缓急，分纲分目分细节地去抓，真正作到抓住重点带动全面，一环套一环，纲举目张，成套革新。特别值得提出的是：西安人民搪瓷厂的领导者们，不是一般地去抓关键，而是深入了解每一个关键问题的细节，找到矛盾的焦点，又和工人群众、技术干部三结合地去分析研究解决问题。这样，就真正把思想工作渗透到生产、技术活动的里层，把政治工作和经济工作有机地结合起来，使政治工作真正变成了经济工作的灵魂，就使得问题的解决又快又好。西安人民搪瓷厂能够在重大革新建议实现后生产情况发生了新的变化时，以最快的速度，按照实际需要改变生产工艺过程，调整劳动组织，开展技术练兵，制定新的操作规程和生产定额，建立新的规章制度等等，使企业管理工作很快地跟了上去，及时地巩固技术革新的成果。而经营管理的改进、人与人关系的改善，也就是生产关系和生产力的发展相适应，又促使技术革新运动不断向前发展。
      革新无止境　天外更有天
    上海“解放”半月刊1960年第四期发表了以“技术革新和技术革命的新发展”为题的评论，摘要如下：
    当前，上海工业战线的技术革新和技术革命运动，出现了令人鼓舞的新形势。主要是：广大群众干劲更大，热气更高，表现出极大的主动性和首创精神，运动具有更为广泛的群众性。运动已经从一般工具操作的革新发展到实现机械化和半机械化；从一般产品的革新发展到创制高级精密产品，攻取尖端技术；从个人搞技术革新发展到企业内外广泛组织“三结合”。
    所有这些都表明，技术革新和技术革命运动正走向更广泛更深入更持续发展的道路。面对着技术革新和技术革命运动的新形势，是持续地跃进，而且要跃进得更好更全面，还是停止下来不再继续跃进？这个问题便提到了每个企业领导者的面前。多快好省和少慢差费两种方法的斗争，在新形势下又会反映出来。有些人有一种比较法，就是把过去规划的旧蓝图和今天的成就作比较，而不去和加速社会主义建设以至过渡到共产主义的大蓝图作比较；只看到已出现的新技术、新工艺、新设备，而不放开眼去看一看国内以至世界上已经达到的最先进水平，于是便觉得心满意足，跃进可以到此为止了。这样比，好似自己给自己制造了一个笼子，在小天地里怡然自得；至于笼子外面，群众发出新的雄心大志的豪言和兴致勃勃大闹革新的新创举，却看不见，或者以为不过是少数人的举动，一时的创造。有了这种想法，当然就看不到技术革新和技术革命运动中出现的新形势，看不到工人阶级精神面貌正在发生的巨大变化。但是，干劲冲天的人却采取的是另一种比较法，就是朝前看，而不朝后看；立足现实，面向未来，把今天和明天、后天比；跳出自己单位的小圈子；和一切最先进的水平比。这样一比，眼界顿开。越比，心里越紧张。这种紧张是好事，打破了停止不前的安宁，觉得非加紧干不可，非立下不断革命的雄心大志不可。看到楼外有楼，天外有天，于是耳聪目明了，群众的新要求、新创造尽入眼底，而且精心去注意它，研究它，并且立即动手去推广它，群众的心思成了领导的心思，领导和群众的目标一致，感情合拍了，劲头扭在一起了，促进继续跃进也就成为可能了。两种比法，必然会有两种结果。
    在这样的新形势下面，要把技术革新和技术革命运动引向更广泛、更深入、更持久，必须使运动具有越来越大的群众性。因此在开展技术革新和技术革命中，要注意多样化，使普及和提高相结合，用两条腿走路，而不要只用一条腿或一条半腿走路。在企业中贯彻执行党的总路线确定的“两条腿走路”的方针，是为了使生产力发展的各种因素正确地互相结合，并充分发挥其一切积极作用的方针。只有这样，才能把广大群众的革命干劲和创造力量最充分地调动起来。忽视任何一条腿，必然会造成少慢差费，冷冷清清。
    因此，一方面，积极发展为国家建设迫切需要的高级精密尖端产品，在一切有条件的企业里，都要把它看做是生产发展的主要方向，努力做出更大的成绩来。另方面，又要注意努力提高一般产品的质量，争取达到国内同类产品的第一流的水平。只有抓住前者为重点，才能用最先进技术来武装工业，创造更高的劳动生产率，进一步满足国家建设和人民生活的需要，为一般产品的提高指示方向。但是，为了要发展高级精密尖端产品，也要求一般产品的质量和技术水平大大提高作为基础。一般产品的质量和技术水平提高了，就会不断为向高级精密尖端产品进军提供新的物质和技术条件。因此，两者是不能分割的，而是相互促进，共同提高的。
    一方面，应该努力采用新技术，新工艺，新设备，改变手工操作的落后状态，努力提高机械化程度，有条件的企业还应向自动化进军，只有这样才能把工业转移到现代化的技术基础上。但另方面，又不能忽视从具体的物质技术条件出发，充分发挥原有设备的利用率，重视群众操作工具的点滴改革，能采用洋法的就采用洋法，不能采用洋法的就采用土法或土洋结合的方法。
    由于运动发展迅猛，广大群众的革新建议越来越多，先进标兵成行成阵，先进经验和发明创造成套成列，还要求我们通过有组织地交流先进经验，加以总结提高，使之成为比较完整的经验来加以推广。这样就可以使分散的技术经验系统化，把个别部门的革新经验在全行业全地区普遍开花，促使整个企业整个行业实现全面的技术改造，使先进经验在集中起来到推广下去的过程中，不断丰富，不断完善。
