    Large-Scale Collaboration
    Li Fu
    The factories, enterprises, and transportation departments in the eastern suburbs of Beijing have organized a "one-dragon" transportation collaboration, which can reduce the number of personnel specializing in transportation by 150, increase the cargo turnover efficiency of the station by more than double, and greatly increase the unloading volume, ensuring the continued leap forward in industrial production in this area.
    Why is it that when industrial production is growing rapidly, and the contradiction between transportation volume and capacity is becoming more acute in some areas, this contradiction has been resolved here? Why has the transportation efficiency in this area been improved so quickly and so greatly? Generally speaking, they have adopted two methods. One method is the technological innovation in transportation, especially the mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading, which is an important method for developing productivity and improving transportation efficiency. However, relying solely on this method cannot completely solve the problem. The transportation conditions and loading and unloading equipment in the eastern suburbs of Beijing are relatively advanced, but the situation where transportation lags behind production could never be reversed in the past. Later, they added another method, which is to carry out significant innovations in the organization and management of transportation. They adopted a series of measures such as unified allocation of loading and unloading forces in various units, shared use of railway special lines, and door-to-door delivery without goods touching the ground, reversing the passive situation of transportation and ensuring the needs of production. This shows that necessary changes in production relations and the organization of communist large-scale collaboration can fully liberate and develop productive forces.
    Similar situations may not be isolated cases. Within a region, loading and unloading manpower and machinery that could have been organized uniformly are used in a decentralized manner; lines that could have been shared are exclusively used by one unit; mutual support could have been provided, but instead, contracts and regulations are relied upon to restrict each other. How can this relationship not be an obstacle to the development of productive forces? It can be seen that adjusting this relationship, changing from decentralization to collectivism, from exclusive use to shared use, and from mutual entanglement to mutual support, is not only necessary for the leap forward in production of individual enterprises, but also necessary for all related factories and mines.
    Continued leap forward in production makes transportation a key. Let us learn from the experience of the eastern suburbs of Beijing, do a better job in transportation, and promote a faster leap forward in production!

    大协作
    黎夫
    北京东郊地区的工厂企业和运输部门组织了“一条龙”运输大协作，专办运输的人员可减少一百五十个，车站的货物周转效率提高了一倍多，卸车量大大提高，保证了这个地区工业生产的继续跃进。
    为什么当工业生产迅速增长，有些地区运量与运力的矛盾更为尖锐，而在这里，这个矛盾却得到了解决？为什么这个地区的运输效率提的这么快，这么高？大体说来，他们采取了两个办法。一个办法是运输技术上的革新，特别是装卸机械化和半机械化，这是发展生产力，提高运输效率的重要方法。但是，仅靠这一办法还不能完全解决问题。北京东郊地区的运输条件和装卸设备都是比较先进的，但是过去运输落后于生产的局面总是扭不过来。后来它们又加上了一个办法，那就是在运输的组织管理上，也进行了重大的革新。他们采取了统一调配各单位的装卸力量，共同使用铁路专用线，实行货不落地、送货上门等一系列措施，扭转了运输被动的局面，保证了生产的需要。这就表明了从生产关系上进行必要的变革，组织共产主义的大协作，就能够充分解放和发展生产力。
    类似这种情况，也许不是个别的。在一个地区内，本来可以统一组织起来的装卸人力和机具，却分散使用；本来可以共用的线路，却是一个单位专用；本来可以互相支援，却是互相依靠订合同、立规章来制约。这种关系怎能不是生产力发展的阻碍？可见，调整了这种关系，由分散变为集体，由专用变为共用，由彼此牵扯变为彼此支援，不仅为个别企业生产跃进所需要，而且为一切有关联的厂矿企业所需要。
    生产继续跃进，运输是一个关键。让我们学习北京东郊地区的经验，把运输工作做的更好，促进生产更快地跃进！
