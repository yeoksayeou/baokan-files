    Learn From the Advanced
    Zhejiang Hangzhou Su Yifeng
    Su Guangming, who was already doing the work of 1971, is a well-known old hero. However, he "lives and learns," like a bee, flying to wherever there is honey (advanced experience) to collect. He learns not only from veteran workers but also from new workers. He learned from a new worker, Che Tianxin, the method of milling connecting rod pins, thereby doubling production efficiency. He not only learns from new workers but also from apprentices. He learned advanced methods of coupling from female apprentice Ji Rongzhi, thereby also improving production efficiency. This is one example of learning from the advanced. Example two: Xu Chenglong, a young carpenter and technical innovation expert from Shandong Province, created and improved 65 kinds of machines, tools, and operating methods during the First Five-Year Plan period, creating and saving 1.5 million yuan for the country. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, he accelerated the pace of the Great Leap Forward, marching towards the peak of science and technology. By last year, he had made another thirty or forty creations and innovations. Is Xu Chenglong a genius of invention? No. He was originally an ordinary young carpenter who had only two years of schooling. The reason he was able to do so much is that he is good at learning. Whenever he thinks of a problem, he always seeks opinions everywhere, consulting and learning from others. Because of his hard work and diligent study, he finally became a model technical innovator.
    Those who are good at creating are also good at learning. The examples of Su Guangming and Xu Chenglong illustrate this truth. They differ in age and achievements, but they have one thing in common: they are never satisfied with their existing achievements, but constantly learn, humbly learn, and conscientiously learn.
    To be good at learning from others and truly learn every bit of advanced experience, there must be a prerequisite: listening to the Party and having a red heart that is loyal to the Party's cause; having a red heart of the working class that always thinks of the collective cause. With this bright red heart, one will not be satisfied with one's existing achievements, one will diligently study, conscientiously consult and learn from others, and one will climb the peak of science and technology without fear of hardships on a difficult and tortuous road, gathering the trickles of wisdom into a magnificent river.

    见先进就学
    浙江杭州　苏以风
    早已经在干1971年活的苏广铭，是人所熟知的老英雄，然而他“活到老，学到老”，像蜜蜂似的，哪个地方有蜜（先进经验），就飞向那儿去采。他不仅向老工人学，也向新工人学。他向新工人车田新学习了铣连结器肖子的方法，因而把生产效率提高了一倍。他不仅向新工人学，还向徒工学，他就向女徒工姬荣芝学习过车钩的先进方法，因而也提高了生产效率。这是见先进就学的例子之一。例子之二：山东省的技术革新能手青年木工徐呈龙，在第一个五年计划期间，创造和改进了六十五种机器、工具和操作方法，为国家创造和节约了财富一百五十万元；在第二个五年计划期间，他更加快了跃进的步伐，朝着科学技术的高峰前进，到去年为止又有三、四十种创造和革新。徐呈龙难道是什么创造发明的天才？不是。他原来是个只读过两年书的普通的青年木工，他之所以能够如此，因为他善于学习。他无论想到什么问题，总要到处征求意见，向人请教向人学习。由于他的苦学苦钻，所以终于成为技术革新的标兵。
    善于创造的人，也正是善于学习的人。苏广铭、徐呈龙的范例就说明了这一条真理。他们年龄不同，成绩也不一样，但有一点是相同的，那就是他们从不满足于已有的成就，而是不断地学习，虚心地学习，踏踏实实地学习。
    要善于向别人学习，真正做到学先进点滴不让，还得有个前提，那就是：听党的话，有一颗为党的事业而忠心耿耿的红心；有一颗工人阶级时时刻刻想到集体事业的红心。有了这颗鲜艳的红心，才会不满足于自己既得的成就，才会刻苦地去钻研，踏踏实实地去向别人请教、向别人学习，才会不避艰险地在艰难曲折的道路上去攀登科学技术的高峰，把点点滴滴的智慧的细流，汇成波澜壮阔的江河。
