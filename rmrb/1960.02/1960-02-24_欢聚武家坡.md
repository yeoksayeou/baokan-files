    Joyful Gathering at Wujiapo
    On February 9th, the pig farm in Wujiapo, Chengguan Commune, Fushan County, Shanxi Province, was filled with extraordinary joy. A group of distinguished guests, no, relatives—worker representatives from Taiyuan City—came here to celebrate with the peasant brothers.

    Liu Xuewen, the model inseminator of the pig farm, introduced his insemination experience to the workers, which made them all happy and excited. However, the rumbling of machinery attracted the workers' attention even more. A complete set of automated pig-raising equipment made the workers constantly praise the peasants' creative spirit.

    In the feed workshop, Wu Jigui, a technician from Jinyuan Agricultural Implement Factory, saw a large wooden wheel spinning and swaying from side to side on the frame: "This is not safe enough." After looking it over, he took out an axe from his tool bag and cut a wooden plug to insert, and the large wheel immediately turned faster and more steadily.

    At the symposium, the commune members sought opinions from the worker representatives.

    "The large wheel in the feed workshop can be slightly improved to speed up the rotation."

    "An automatic grain-feeding wooden frame should be installed in the flour-milling workshop to eliminate manual operation of feeding grain and reduce the labor force by one person."

    "..."

    Wang Ruxian, the head of the worker delegation, decided: "Let's set up a technical team and immediately start working to further improve the mechanization of the pig farm."

    A warm applause immediately erupted at the symposium. The farmers' cheerful songs also came from the pig farm: Water lilies have interconnected roots, worker and peasant brothers have connected hearts,... (Zhou Xueren, Wang Jiale, Xu Zengzhen)

    欢聚武家坡
    二月九日山西浮山县城关公社武家坡的养猪场里，分外喜气洋洋。这里来了一批贵客，不，是亲人——太原市的工人代表，和农民兄弟联欢。
    猪场的模范配种员刘学文，向工人们介绍了配种经验，使工人们个个欢心激动。但是，隆隆的机器声，更吸引着工人们的心，一整套养猪自动化的设备，使工人们不住地赞颂农民兄弟们的创造精神。
    在饲料车间，晋源农具厂的技术工人武继桂，看到一个飞转的大木轮，在架上左右摇摆：“这可不够安全”。他看了一遍，顺手从工具袋里取出了斧头，砍了个木塞垫进去，大轮子立即稳稳地转得更快了。
    座谈会上，社员们向工人代表们征求意见。
    “饲料车间的大轮稍稍改进，还能加快转速。”
    “磨面车间要再安上一个自动上粮木架，上粮就可以不用人工操作，还可减少一个劳动力。”
    “……。”
    工人代表团团长王汝贤决定：“咱们成立一个技术组，马上动手把猪场的机械化程度更提高一步。”
    座谈会上立即爆发出热烈的掌声。猪场上也传来了农民们愉快的歌声：水仙花儿根连根，工农兄弟心连心，……。		　（周学仁、汪家乐、许增祯）
