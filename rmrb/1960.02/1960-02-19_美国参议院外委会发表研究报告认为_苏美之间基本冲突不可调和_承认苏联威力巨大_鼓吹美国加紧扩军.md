Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch from Washington: The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee released on the 13th a study report drafted for the committee by a group of experts from Columbia University and Harvard University regarding U.S. foreign policy toward the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. This report expressed alarm at the immense power and influence of the Soviet Union and vehemently advocated that the United States use all means, especially accelerating military expansion, to prevent the further expansion of Soviet power and influence.

This report, titled "U.S. Foreign Policy—The Soviet Union and Eastern Europe," is one of fifteen research reports prepared by U.S. authorities to find countermeasures in the face of the situation where the East wind is further prevailing over the West wind. Senator Fulbright, Chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, admitted in the foreword he wrote for this report that a careful study of all aspects of U.S. foreign policy was a direct result of the "Committee's unease about the possible impact of Soviet scientific achievements on the relationship between the United States and the rest of the world."

The report worriedly discussed the great achievements of Soviet economic construction and its huge international influence. It wrote, "More than two years ago, the launch of the first (artificial) satellite forced the United States to reflect. To the surprise of most Americans, the Soviet Union, which had always been depicted as an un-mechanized peasant country, was indeed able to achieve such astonishing achievements that the United States itself had not been able to achieve until then." The report believes that the comparison of industrial production between the U.S. and the Soviet Union is "worrying." It said that even using the lowest figures in U.S. statistics regarding the annual growth of Soviet output and the highest figures for U.S. growth, one cannot help but conclude that "in fifteen to twenty years, the production of Soviet industrial products will exceed that of the United States." The report acknowledges that the time to exceed this will come even sooner. The report said that there is every reason to believe that the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for developing the national economy "can be completed or overfulfilled."

The report's drafters said uneasily that the strengthening of Soviet economic strength enables it to expand preferential assistance to underdeveloped countries and become a "model of rapid industrialization" for underdeveloped countries. The report said, "The exchange of technical experts, economic assistance, the possibility of trade, the growth of Soviet prestige and power, satellites, lunar rockets—all these factors have deepened the impression that the Soviet Union is the future," "The Soviet Union embodies progress, victory, and the future." The report also predicted that "the strength and influence of the Soviet Union will be further strengthened."

The report's drafters emphasized the irreconcilable "fundamental conflict" between the U.S. and the Soviet Union and opposed taking any measures to ease international tensions. They wrote that peaceful coexistence or the Cold War—this is only "the continuation of the conflict in different forms." They argued, "The United States and its allies must be prepared to use military, political, and economic means to ensure that the power and influence of the Soviet Union does not expand further."

This report recommended to the U.S. ruling group to strengthen military expansion and increase spending on the development of missile weapons and other military equipment. It wrote, "It is extremely important for the United States not to allow the development of an imbalance of military power favorable to the Soviet Union." It demanded that expenses in military, space, and foreign aid, etc., must be increased "unreservedly," and even said that matters like the development of missiles cannot be restricted by budgetary considerations. The report also advocated that in a "nuclear standoff," it is necessary to strengthen the weapons and troops for "limited wars." This argument in the report was supported by Senator Fulbright, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In the foreword to the report, he also vigorously advocated that the American people "make the necessary sacrifices" to expand military preparations and arms race.

The report opposes a complete ban on nuclear weapons, saying that this "will not strengthen the stability of peace in the slightest." It also believes that efforts to ban nuclear weapons testing are "not steps towards disarmament." However, on the other hand, the report advocates that "the United States should continue to negotiate with the Soviet Union constantly" as a "measure" to "cooperate" with military expansion and arms race. These remarks fully expose the lack of sincerity of the report's drafters towards negotiations, and they are only using it as a means to buy time to develop military strength.

### 美国参议院外委会发表研究报告认为  苏美之间基本冲突不可调和  承认苏联威力巨大　鼓吹美国加紧扩军

    美国参议院外委会发表研究报告认为
    苏美之间基本冲突不可调和
    承认苏联威力巨大　鼓吹美国加紧扩军
    新华社17日讯　华盛顿消息：美国参议院外交委员会13日发表了哥伦比亚大学和哈佛大学一批专家为这个委员会草拟的一个关于美国对苏联和东欧国家的外交政策的研究报告。这份报告对苏联的威力和影响的巨大表示惊惶，并且极力鼓吹美国用一切手段、特别是加紧扩充军备的办法来使苏联的力量和影响不再扩大。
    这个题为“美国对外政策——苏联和东欧”的报告，是美国当局在东风进一步压倒西风的形势下为了找寻对策而准备的十五项研究报告之一。美国参议院外交委员会主席富布赖特在他为这个报告写的前言中承认，对美国外交政策的各个方面进行仔细研究，是“委员会对苏联科学成就可能对美国同世界其他国家的关系产生的影响感到不安”的直接结果。
    报告忧心忡忡地谈到苏联经济建设的伟大成就和在国际上的巨大影响。它写道，“两年多前，第一个（人造）卫星的发射迫使美国反省，大多数美国人感到突如其来的是，一向被描绘成没有机械化的农民国家的苏联，确实能够取得了美国自己到那时为止不能取得的这种惊人的成就”。报告认为，美苏两国工业生产的比较“令人担心”。它说，甚至引用美国统计中关于苏联每年产值增长的最低一种数字和美国增长的最高一种数字，也不能不得出这样的结论：“再过十五到二十年后苏联工业品的生产将超过美国”。报告承认，超过的时间还会更早。报告说，有一切理由可以说，苏联发展国民经济七年计划“可以完成或超额完成”。
    报告起草人不安地说，苏联经济实力的加强使它有可能扩大对不发达国家的条件优惠的援助，成为不发达国家“迅速工业化的榜样”。报告说，“互派技术专家、经济援助、贸易的可能性、苏联威望和威力的增长、卫星、月球火箭——所有这些因素都加深了人们这样一种印象：苏联就是未来”，“苏联体现着进步、胜利和未来”。报告还预料，“苏联的力量和影响将进一步加强。”
    报告起草人强调苏美之间存在着不可调和的“基本冲突”，反对采取缓和国际紧张局势的任何措施。他们写道，和平共处或冷战——这只是“冲突以不同形式继续而已”。他们主张，“美国和它的盟国必须准备使用军事、政治和经济的种种手段来确使苏联的力量和影响不致进一步扩大”。
    这个报告向美国统治集团建议加强扩充军备，增加发展导弹武器和其他军备的开支。它写道：“美国不让发展一种有利于苏联的军事力量的不平衡状态，这是极为重要的。”它要求必须“不折不扣地”增加在军事、空间、对外援助等方面的费用，甚至说像发展导弹这类事情不能受预算方面考虑的约束。报告还主张在“核对峙状态”下有必要加强“有限战争”的武器和军队。报告的这种论调得到了参议院外交委员会主席富布赖特的支持。他在报告的前言中也大力鼓吹要美国人民“作出必要的牺牲”来扩军备战。
    报告反对全面禁止核武器，说什么这“丝毫不能加强和平的稳定性”。它还认为禁止核武器试验的努力“不是迈向裁军的步骤”。但是，另一方面，报告却主张“美国应该继续不断地”同苏联谈判，作为“配合”扩军备战的“措施”。这些言论充分暴露了报告起草人对谈判缺乏诚意，只是把它当作争取时间发展军事实力的手段。
