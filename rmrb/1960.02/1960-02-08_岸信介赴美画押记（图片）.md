Kishi Nobusuke's Trip to the US to Sign the Document

The Prime Minister goes on a pilgrimage,
Offering the roof as a gift,
The common people suffer,
Washington is pleased.

Signing the infamous paper,
Pressing the golden seal on his face,
Determined to be an accomplice,
Wanting to be a war criminal again.

Going like a rat,
Returning like a spider,
Rats are hated by everyone,
Spiders are even more disgusting.

Ansei once sold the country (note),
Kishi inherits the mantle,
Calling the loss of sovereignty "improved relations,"
Bringing disaster to Japan.

Luo Baoqi's accompanying poem.

(The first cartoon originally appeared in the Japanese "Asahi Shimbun," and the remaining three appeared in the "Akahata" [Red Flag])

(Note) In 1860, the United States used the threat of warships and cannons to force Japan to sign the Ansei Treaty ("Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan"). Now, the reactionary forces of the United States and Japan are vigorously promoting the so-called "100 years of US-Japan amity."

    岸信介赴美画押记首相去朝圣，屋顶作礼品，老百姓遭殃，华盛顿高兴。臭名纸上签，金印脸上按，决心当帮凶，再要作战犯。去时像老鼠，归来似蜘蛛，老鼠人人憎，蜘蛛更可恶。安政曾卖国（注），岸某承衣钵，丧权称“修好”，给日本招祸。罗葆齐配诗
    （漫画第一幅原载日本“朝日新闻”，其余三幅原载“赤旗报”）（注）1860年美国用军舰大炮的威胁，强迫日本签订了安政条约（“日美友好通商条约”）。现在美日反动派大肆宣传所谓“日美修好”一百年。
