    Seize the Time, Strive for Initiative, Prepare for Spring Plowing Quickly:
    People of Shandong, Heilongjiang, and Ningxia Strive for a Good Start to Spring Plowing
    Shandong
    According to Xinhua News Agency, under the guidance of the idea of "earlier, earlier, and earlier," Shandong has launched a vigorous spring plowing preparation campaign. Many counties and communes have broken with convention and started work as early as the first day of the Lunar New Year. Small carts transporting fertilizer are coming and going, presenting a busy scene of spring plowing production everywhere.
    This year's spring plowing preparation in Shandong is generally half a month earlier than in previous years, with faster progress and better quality. Most of the seeds and farm tools needed for spring plowing have been exchanged, carefully selected, rushed to be made and repaired, and great achievements have been made in accumulating and making fertilizers. Under the slogan of "seizing time, striving for initiative, and striving for a good start to spring plowing," Liaocheng Prefecture has provided sufficient fertilizer for 50% of the spring fields, newly dug and renovated more than 280,000 irrigation channels at all levels, and more than 1.5 million mu of spring fields have reached the standard of advanced garden-style fields. In Linyi Prefecture, nearly half of the 8.5 million mu of spring fields have been leveled, the ridges have been repaired, and more than 330,000 pigpens have been built in the fields. Linqing City has demarcated more than 1,500 high-yield demonstration plots for spring-sown crops, covering ten thousand mu, one thousand mu, and one hundred mu. All 780,000 mu of spring fields in the city have been harrowed. Fertilizer delivery work is also in full swing everywhere.
    In order to improve the mechanization level of cultivation, drainage and irrigation, and transportation, in addition to repairing existing farm tools, various new farm tools have also been rushed to be made and modified. Zibo Prefecture has manufactured 100,000 pieces of various farm tools and repaired 440,000 pieces of farm tools. Penglai County has produced more than 400 pieces of semi-mechanized plowing and harrowing farm tools. Liang Jianzhong, Secretary of the Chiping County Party Committee, led cadres to organize more than 1,000 iron and woodworking workers, and rushed to make and repair more than 56,000 pieces of various farm tools in ten days according to the needs of the communes and teams.
    Heilongjiang
    This newspaper reports that the vast rural areas of Heilongjiang Province are carrying out vigorous spring plowing preparations, including water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, farm tool repair, seed selection, and land preparation.
    This year, spring plowing preparations in Heilongjiang Province are proceeding particularly early. Many areas, as soon as they completed the autumn sowing, autumn plowing, and delivery of public grain purchase tasks last year, immediately switched to spring plowing preparations centered on water and fertilizer. At present, the province has completed about 40% of the annual water conservancy construction tasks, 28% of the fertilizer delivery, and more than 40% of the farm tool repairs. The province has also seen units that have completed individual spring plowing preparation tasks very well. For example, Nehe, Kedong, and Huachuan counties have completed seed exchange, careful selection, and germination tests; Hailun and Mingshui counties have completed farm tool repairs and reformed spring sowing tools; Zhaodong County has completed 35% of the annual soil improvement plan.
    Now, on the basis of the significant achievements already made, the spring plowing production in various parts of the province is carrying out a comprehensive inspection to continue to strengthen the spring plowing preparation work centered on water and fertilizer. The Songhua River Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, through inspection and comparison, used Wuchang County, where all spring plowing preparation work has made comprehensive progress, as a model, and organized the entire region to carry out a "learn from Wuchang, catch up with Wuchang" spring plowing production movement month. Shuangcheng, Suihua, Wangkui, Suiling, Zhaoyuan and other counties have all adopted the method of comprehensive inspection and comparison to select models in their respective counties, and at the same time promote the experience of Wuchang County.
    Ningxia
    Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, February 10th. The people's communes in various parts of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region are seizing the time and season to vigorously grasp the spring plowing preparation work.
    At present, the mountainous areas have over-accumulated the fertilizer needed for the whole year. The quality of fertilizer accumulation in the entire region has also increased by about 20% compared with last year, with human and animal manure accounting for about 70%. More than 60% of the spring field fertilizer in the province has been delivered to the fields. The spring sowing seeds in various places have begun to be carefully selected and disinfected. Some areas have also held on-site meetings on spring wheat seed dressing with pesticides and hot water soaking, and trained a large number of seed dressing and soaking technicians. Various places have also adopted both indigenous and foreign methods, from indigenous to foreign methods, to mobilize the masses to vigorously reform and create spring plowing tools. More than 200 standard tractors in various communes in the region have been maintained and repaired.
    Since last winter, various parts of Ningxia have been grasping the preparation of spring plowing. The people's communes have been speeding up water conservancy construction while preparing farm tools and seeds.

    抓时间　争主动　快备耕
    山东黑龙江宁夏人民力争春耕开门红
    山东
    据新华社讯山东各地在“一早百早”的思想指导下，展开了轰轰烈烈的备耕活动。许多县、社都打破常规，在农历正月初一就开始行动，积肥送粪的小车来来往往，到处呈现着春耕生产的繁忙景象。
    今年山东的备耕活动，一般比往年提前了半个月，进度快，质量也好。春耕需要的种子、农具等大部分经过调换精选和赶制修配，积制肥料取得很大成绩。聊城专区在“抢时间，争主动，力夺春耕开门红”的口号下，已给50％的春田送足了肥料，新挖和整修各级灌溉渠道二十八万多条，并有一百五十多万亩春田达到高级园田化的标准。临沂专区八百五十万亩春田中，近一半已整平了地面，修好畦田，并在田间修建猪圈三十三万多个。临清市已划好万亩、千亩、百亩春播作物丰产方一千五百多个，全市七十八万亩春田全部顶凌耙耢过。各地送肥工作也搞得热火朝天。
    为了提高耕作、排灌、运输等方面的机械化程度，各地除检修原有农具外，还赶制和改制了大量的式新农具。淄博专区已制造各种农具十万件，修理农具四十四万件；蓬莱县已生产半机械化耕耙农具四百多件。茌平县委书记梁建忠带领干部组织了一千多名铁木工人，根据社、队的需要，十天内赶制赶修各种农具五万六千多件。
    黑龙江
    本报讯　黑龙江省广大农村以兴修水利、积肥、整修农具和选种整地等为内容的备耕工作，正搞得红火。
    今年，黑龙江省的备耕工作进行得特别早，许多地区早在去年秋播、秋耕、送交公购粮任务一完成，就立即转入以水肥为中心的备耕活动。目前全省水利施工任务已完成本年度计划的40％左右，送粪完成28％，农具检修完成40％以上。全省还出现了单项备耕工作完成得十分出色的单位。例如讷河、克东、桦川等县已经完成种子串换、精选、发芽试验等工作；海伦、明水等县完成农具检修，改革了春播工具；肇东县已经完成了全年土壤改良计划的35％。
    现在，全省各地备耕生产在已经取得重大成就的基础上，正在开展全面大检查，继续加强以水肥为中心的备耕工作。中共松花江地委通过检查、评比，以各项备耕工作全面跃进的五常县为标兵，组织全区开展“学五常、赶五常”的备耕生产运动月。双城、绥化、望奎、绥棱、肇源等县，都采取大检查、大评比的办法，选出本县的标兵，同时推广五常县的经验。
    宁夏
    新华社银川10日电　宁夏回族自治区各地人民公社抓时间、抢季节，大抓备耕工作。
    目前，山区已超额积完了全年所需的肥料。全区积肥质量也比去年提高20％左右，人粪尿圈肥占70％左右。全省60％以上的春田肥料已经送到地里。各地的春播籽种已开始精选和消毒。有些地区还召开春麦药剂拌种和温汤浸种现场会议，训练了大批拌种、浸种技术员。各地还采取土洋并举，由土到洋的办法，发动群众大力改革和创制春耕工具。全区各公社的二百多部标准台拖拉机，都经过维护和检修。
    宁夏各地去冬以来就抓紧备耕工作，各人民公社一面加紧水利建设，一面准备农具种籽等。
