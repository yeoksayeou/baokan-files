Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 16th - The National Executive Bureau of the Cuban People's Socialist Party today published a statement in "Hoy" (Today), warmly congratulating the agreement signed between Cuba and the Soviet Union.

The statement said that the joint communiqué of the two governments reflects the wishes of the Cuban people, which no Cuban government has ever dared to uphold and express. The Soviet-Cuban trade agreement is "a bold and very positive step on the established path of expanding and opening up Cuba's foreign markets, thereby promoting economic independence and accelerating industrialization and agricultural development."

The statement also made a sharp contrast between Soviet assistance and the attitude of the United States. It said that the United States threatened to boycott the Cuban economy, condoned counter-revolutionary planes bombing Cuban sugarcane fields, and obstructed Cuba from implementing industrialization and eliminating the semi-feudal latifundia system.

Cuban public opinion warmly welcomes the trade agreement signed between Cuba and the Soviet Union. Many newspapers have emphasized in their commentaries that this agreement is in line with the vital interests of the Cuban people and will help strengthen the sovereignty and independence of the Cuban people.

"Revolución" said in a commentary published on the 14th that the signing of the Cuban-Soviet trade agreement is a heavy blow to the stupid policy pursued by the United States in Latin America. An editorial in "Revolución" pointed out that Soviet-Cuban trade will free Cuba from submitting to the will of the U.S. Congress, which unilaterally decides sugar prices and other conditions. The newspaper also said that the loans provided by the Soviet Union to Cuba for the purchase of machinery "ensure that our plans in this regard will not be hindered by the unavailability of goods in other markets."

Various newspapers have also published talks and statements from workers, teachers, peasant organizations, and social groups welcoming the Soviet-Cuban trade agreement.

    支持古巴革命　打击美国阴谋
    古巴舆论评苏古贸易协定巨大意义
    据新华社哈瓦那16日电　古巴人民社会党全国委员会执行局今天在“今日报”上发表声明，热烈祝贺古巴同苏联签订的协定。
    声明说，两国政府的联合公报反映了从来没有任何古巴政府敢于坚持和表示的古巴人民的愿望。古苏贸易协定是“在已经制定的扩大和开辟古巴的国外市场、从而促进经济独立和加速工业化及农业发展的道路上，迈出了大胆和非常积极的一步”。
    声明还把苏联的援助同美国的态度作了鲜明的对比。它说，美国扬言要抵制古巴经济，纵容反革命飞机轰炸古巴甘蔗田，阻挠古巴实行工业化和消灭半封建的大庄园制度。
    古巴公众舆论热烈欢迎古巴同苏联签订的贸易协定。许多报纸都在评论中着重指出，这个协定符合古巴人民的切身利益，有助于加强古巴人民的主权和独立。
    “国民日报”在14日发表的评论中说，古巴苏联贸易协定的签订，是对美国在拉丁美洲所执行的愚蠢政策的沉重打击。“革命报”的社论指出，古苏贸易将使古巴不再屈从于片面决定糖价和其他条件的美国国会的意志。这家报纸还说，苏联向古巴提供的用来购买机器的贷款，“保证我们在这方面的计划不致因为在其他市场上买不到东西而受到阻碍”。
    各报还发表了许多工人、教师、农民组织和社会团体欢迎古苏贸易协定的谈话和声明。
