Xinhua News Agency, 20th: Reports of victory in winter farmland water conservancy projects are pouring in from all over. The water conservancy army across the country, undeterred by wind, snow, and severe cold, digging through hard soil and solid rock, working hard and skillfully all winter, have already completed more than 3.1 million water conservancy projects such as reservoirs, ponds, dams, canals, culverts, 闸 gates, and wells. It is estimated that the irrigated area can be expanded and improved by about 200 million mu.

This winter's construction progress is faster than the previous two winters. Currently, nine provinces, including Henan, Shaanxi, Anhui, Gansu, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Qinghai, have completed or overfulfilled their plans ahead of schedule. The amount of earth and stone work completed nationwide is over 20 billion cubic meters. Most of the national soil and water conservation projects have also been completed, with the progress being twice as fast as the same period last year. Due to different natural conditions, small-scale projects in the south were completed earlier than in the north. Provinces and regions such as Guangdong and Guangxi had already built a large number of small-scale projects by the end of last year. Most of the small-scale projects in the Jianghuai River Basin were also completed before the Spring Festival. In the north, 80% of the small-scale projects were completed before the Spring Festival, and some continued to be constructed after the Spring Festival.

The high-efficiency campaign in water conservancy projects in various regions has not only accelerated the progress of the projects but also ensured good quality in most cases. In Anqing Special Zone, Anhui Province, none of the more than 100 small and medium-sized reservoirs that have been built have shown any leakage after actual water storage tests. The Sanli Reservoir and the Huilong Reservoir (medium-sized), renovation projects completed in Laibin County, Guangxi, and Wenshan County, Yunnan, both fully meet the standards. According to recent national water conservancy work inspection materials, over 90% of the projects that have been completed nationwide meet the quality requirements, and only 4% to 5% generally need to be repaired. These few projects that do not meet the quality requirements have been promptly remedied upon discovery to ensure quality.

During the winter construction, attention was paid to the problem of project coordination for both continued and newly built projects. Many completed reservoirs, dams, and other projects have been equipped with canals and leveled land, achieving the goal of completed reservoirs and connected channels, with water reaching the leveled land. Many water storage projects have already stored water, and some have begun to irrigate spring fields. Anhui Province has begun to store water in all completed new and old water storage projects. As of February 15, the amount of water stored reached 7 billion cubic meters, which can ensure the water needs for spring-sown crops and spring irrigation of wheat. Of the more than 30,000 small reservoirs newly built in Hunan Province, more than 20,000 have been equipped with canals and spillways, achieving complete engineering. Half of the 50-plus large and medium-sized projects that have been completed have also achieved complete engineering.

With the arrival of spring, in areas where the season is earlier and water conservancy projects have been mostly completed, some of the water conservancy army has already shifted or is about to shift to the intense spring plowing preparation work. For projects that have not yet been completed, various regions are continuing to rush construction while winning victories. It is expected that small-scale projects in various regions can be completed before spring plowing. At present, various regions are also focusing on the construction of large and medium-sized projects to ensure that the large and medium-sized projects that are determined to block floods before the flood season can reach the flood control elevation on schedule or ahead of schedule, and play a role in water storage, irrigation, and other aspects.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th: Shaanxi and Henan provinces, which are experiencing spring drought in our country, and some areas of Shanxi, Shandong, Hebei, Qinghai, Gansu, Liaoning, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong, Fujian, and other provinces where drought symptoms have emerged or the soil moisture is not good, are currently launching a mass spring irrigation and water storage, drought prevention and resistance campaign in conjunction with large-scale preparation for spring plowing, striving to continue the leap forward in agricultural production this year.

Since the beginning of spring, many areas in northern China have experienced high winds, little rain and snow, and high temperatures, resulting in high evaporation. In particular, Shaanxi and Henan provinces, which suffered from a 100-day drought last summer and autumn, have again experienced 100 days of little rain and snow since last winter, resulting in a relatively severe drought. In some coastal areas of eastern Guangdong in the south, the drought that has persisted for several months has not been lifted even with the arrival of spring. Soil moisture in some areas of Shandong and Liaoning is not good enough.

People's communes in drought-stricken areas, under the leadership of local Party committees, have quickly organized forces to carry out drought prevention and resistance struggles. At present, many commune members are working with the spirit of "fighting for every drop of water" to rush to repair water conservancy projects, launch surprise attacks to dig wells and springs, and widely open up all water sources. Some provinces in the Northwest are also moving ice and transporting snow to carry out a large-scale movement of bringing water to the fields. In Shaanxi Province, the drought resistance army currently mobilized has reached more than 3 million, and has already spring-irrigated more than 15 million mu of overwintering wheat (including carrying water to sprinkle irrigation and moving ice to moisten the fields). In Henan Province, more than 60% of the winter wheat planned for irrigation has already been irrigated.

New and old water conservancy projects have played a significant role in drought prevention and resistance. The Jinghui Canal in Shaanxi Province, a large irrigation area with a long history, started spring irrigation early this spring after successfully completing winter irrigation. The Weishan Water Conservancy Hub project in Shandong Province, which was dammed last winter, and the newly built Shuangtapu Reservoir in Gansu Province have both promptly exerted the benefits of storing water for irrigation. The former has irrigated several million mu of winter wheat, etc., and the Shuangtapu Reservoir is expected to store 60 to 70 million cubic meters of Qilian Mountain snowmelt before spring sowing.

### 祖国大地遍布水库塘坝河渠涵闸机井的繁星  全国冬修水利工程三百万处  发生春旱和旱象露头的地区展开防旱抗旱斗争

    祖国大地遍布水库塘坝河渠涵闸机井的繁星
    全国冬修水利工程三百万处
    发生春旱和旱象露头的地区展开防旱抗旱斗争
    据新华社20日讯　各地纷纷传来冬修农田水利工程的捷报。全国各地的水利大军，不畏风雪严寒，挖开硬土坚石，大干、苦干、巧干一冬天，已经修成了各种水库、塘坝、河渠、涵闸、机井等水利工程三百一十多万处，预计可扩大和改善灌溉面积二亿亩左右。
    这次冬修进度较上两次冬修都快。目前全国已经有河南、陕西、安徽、甘肃、湖南、江西、浙江、广东、青海等九省提前完成或超额完成了计划。全国完成的土石工程在二百亿立方米以上。全国水土保持工程的计划大部分也已经完成，进度比去年同期快一倍。由于自然条件不同，南方各地的小型工程完工比北方为早。两广、湖南等省区去年年底就已经修成了大量的小型工程。江淮流域的小型工程到春节前也大都完工。北方的小型工程春节前完成80％，有些到春节后还在继续施工。
    各地水利工程的高工效运动，不仅使工程进度加快，而且绝大部分质量好。安徽省安庆专区现在已修好的一百多处中小型水库，经过实际蓄水考验，没有一处发生漏水现象。广西来宾县和云南文山县已完工的整修工程三利水库和回龙水库（中型），质量都完全合乎标准。根据最近全国水利工作大检查的材料证明，全国已修成的工程90％以上都合乎质量要求，需要修补的一般只占4％到5％。这些少数不合质量要求的工程，一经发现都及时进行了补救，保证了质量。
    各地在冬修中，对续修的和新修的工程，都注意了工程配套的问题。现在已完工的水库、坝塘等工程不少同时修好了渠道，平整了土地，做到了库成渠通，水到地平。不少蓄水工程已经蓄上了水，有的还开始浇灌春地。安徽省已完成的各项新旧蓄水工程都开始蓄了水，到2月15日蓄水量达七十亿立方米，能够保证春耕作物用水和小麦春灌的需要。湖南省新建的三万多座小型水库，有两万多座修了渠道和溢洪道，达到工程成套，已完工的五十多项大中型工程也有一半做到了工程成套。
    春天到来，在季节较早，水利工程已经大部分完成的地区，部分水利大军已经转入或即将转入火热的春耕准备工作。对尚未完工工程，各地还在乘胜继续赶修。预计春耕前各地小型工程可争取全部完工。现在各地还在大抓大中型工程的兴修，以保证决定在汛前拦洪的大中型工程能够按期或提前达到拦洪高程，并发挥蓄水、灌溉等作用。
    据新华社20日讯　我国发生春旱的陕西、河南两省和旱象露头或墒情不好的山西、山东、河北、青海、甘肃、辽宁、云南、贵州、广东、福建等省的部分地区，当前正结合大规模的备耕掀起群众性的春灌蓄水、防旱抗旱工作，力争今年农业生产继续跃进。
    入春以来，我国北方许多地区风大，雨雪少，气温高，蒸发量大。特别是去年夏秋遭到百日大旱的陕西、河南两省，从去冬到现在又是百日少雨、少雪，干旱比较严重。南方广东东部沿海部分地区持续了几个月的旱象，入春也没有解除。山东、辽宁有些地区墒情不够好。
    发生旱象地区的人民公社，在当地党委领导下都迅速地组织力量，开展了防旱抗旱斗争。现在许多人民公社社员正以“点水必争，滴水必夺”的精神，顶冻抢修水利工程，突击打井挖泉，广辟一切水源。西北有些省还搬冰运雪，大搞万水归田运动。陕西省目前出动的抗旱大军已达三百多万，已经春浇越冬小麦一千五百多万亩（包括挑水泼浇和搬冰润田面积在内）。河南省计划浇灌的冬麦，有60％以上已经浇灌完毕。
    新旧水利工程，在防旱抗旱中间都起了很大作用。历史悠久的大灌区陕西省泾惠渠，在胜利完成冬灌后，今春又提早春灌。去冬截流的山东省位山水利枢纽工程和甘肃省新建成的双塔铺大水库，都及时发挥了蓄水浇地效益。前者已浇冬麦等几百万亩，双塔铺水库在春播前预计可蓄祁连山雪水六千万立方米到七千万立方米。
