Coordinating Water Conservancy and Spring Planting
    Wenshan Autonomous Prefecture Rationally Adjusts Water Conservancy Forces, Rushes to Complete Projects Benefiting This Year, 70,000 Laborers Transferred to Spring Planting

    Kunming Dispatch of this newspaper, February 22nd: Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, is implementing a system of prioritizing water conservancy projects, concentrating elite forces to rush to complete projects that can benefit this year. For projects that cannot benefit this year, all mass construction labor, except for the technical construction labor force, has been transferred to support spring planting, ensuring that water conservancy construction and spring planting production do not hinder each other.

    Since last winter, Wenshan Autonomous Prefecture has mobilized 170,000 laborers to engage in large-scale water conservancy projects, launching a high-quality, high-speed competition campaign, which has continuously accelerated the construction progress. By January 30th, the prefecture had completed 65.9% of the planned earth and stone work. Entering February, spring planting work was fully launched throughout the prefecture, and the situation demanded that water conservancy projects be completed early to ensure irrigation water for spring planting, and that labor be withdrawn to invest in spring planting. In response to this situation, the Wenshan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China made a detailed ranking of all unfinished projects in the prefecture, taking measures and actions simultaneously. The ranking resulted in five types of water conservancy projects: The first category consists of 4,015 projects that will be completed and benefit this year, of which 3,974 have already been completed. The remaining 41 can be completed by the end of February without increasing the labor force; the second category consists of 51 projects that will partially benefit this year, of which 19 have been completed, allowing for the withdrawal of more than 10,000 laborers. The remaining 32 will be guaranteed to be completed by the end of February; the third category consists of six projects that will be completed this year but will only benefit next year, of which three have been completed, allowing for the withdrawal of approximately 8,000 laborers. The remaining three will be completed before the flood season without increasing the labor force; the fourth category consists of eight projects that are under construction year-round and will partially benefit this spring. The original allocation of labor for these projects was not large, and some are emergency rescue projects, so it was determined that the labor force would remain unchanged; the fifth category consists of two projects that are under construction year-round and will benefit next year. It was decided to leave 1,300 laborers to persist in technical construction, and all the remaining labor force would be withdrawn to engage in spring planting. In this way, a total of more than 70,000 laborers were withdrawn from water conservancy construction sites throughout the prefecture, effectively strengthening the prefecture's spring planting work.

    After the county committees, according to the instructions of the prefectural committee, planned to transfer a large number of laborers to the spring planting front, in order to ensure that the reservoir projects benefiting this year would be completed on time and with quality by the end of February, they took many effective measures. First, they adhered to putting politics in command, strengthening leadership, fully mobilizing the masses, and launching a high-efficiency finishing movement to rush construction. Each county dispatched capable cadres to key projects to strengthen specific leadership. Guangnan County extracted a total of nine county-level cadres, who went to water conservancy construction sites with weak leadership and slow construction progress. They helped these construction sites carry out a "one-stop" competition, greatly improving work efficiency and significantly accelerating progress. Eight reservoirs, including Bannan, Dongjiao, and Muyi, have been completed ahead of schedule. The second is to mobilize the masses to continue to make great strides in tool reform and improve work efficiency. For example, in Xichou County, due to the widespread promotion of improved tools at various water conservancy construction sites, the average work efficiency per person (ramming square) broke through three cubic meters, and the construction progress advanced by leaps and bounds.

    Due to the strengthened leadership of party committees at all levels and the vigorous mass movement, a finishing assault movement for water conservancy projects has formed a climax throughout the prefecture. Although many counties have withdrawn a large number of laborers, the construction progress has leaped again and again. Wenshan County originally had a total of 40,000 laborers deployed on unfinished water conservancy projects, but now 20,000 have been withdrawn as planned to participate in spring planting activities. The remaining laborers who are persisting on water conservancy construction sites unanimously put forward the fighting slogan of "fewer people can do more work," with everyone full of energy and creating high work efficiency. With half the labor force reduced, the daily amount of earth and stone work completed throughout the county has increased by about one time compared to the past. The projects originally planned to be completed by the end of February throughout the county have recently reported victories ahead of schedule. From February 1st to 7th, four large and medium-sized projects have been completed one after another, and the remaining projects that will benefit this year can be completed by the end of February.

    治水备耕两不误
    文山自治州合理调整水利战线力量，突击当年受益工程，七万民工转入春耕
    本报昆明22日电　云南省文山僮族苗族自治州实行水利工程逐项排队，集中精锐力量突击当年能受益的工程；当年不能受益的工程，除留下技术施工部分的劳动力外，群众性施工部分的劳动力全部转入支援备耕，做到兴修水利与备耕生产两不误。
    去冬以来，文山自治州十七万民工大兴水利，开展高质量高速度竞赛运动，使施工进度不断加快。到1月30日全州完成土石方占施工计划的65．9％。进入2月，全州各地备耕工作全面展开，形势要求水利工程必须提早完工，以保证春耕灌溉用水，并撤下劳力投入备耕。中共文山地委针对这种情况，将全州未完工的工程作一次细致的排队，边排队，边定措施，边行动。排队结果，全州水利工程有五种类型：第一类是当年完工当年受益的，共有四千零十五件，其中有三千九百七十四件已经完工，剩余四十一件，只要抓紧施工，不增加劳动力，在2月底可以完工；第二类是当年有部分受益的工程共五十一件，已完工的有十九件，可抽下劳动力一万多人，其余三十二件保证在2月底完工；第三类是当年完工明年才能受益的工程共六件，已完工三件，可抽下劳动力约八千人；其余三件不增加劳动力，在洪水前可以完工；第四类是常年施工，今春有部分受益工程的共八件，这些工程原来摆布的劳动力就不多，加上有些是抢险工程，确定劳动力不增不减；第五类是常年施工，明年受益的两件，决定留下一千三百个劳动力坚持技术施工，其余劳力全部撤下来搞备耕。这样，全州从水利工地上撤下来的劳动力共达七万多人，有力地加强了全州的备耕工作。
    各县根据地委指示，有计划地把大批劳动力转移到备耕战线以后，为了保证当年受益的水库工程2月底按时按质量完工，采取了许多有效措施。首先是坚持政治挂帅，加强领导，充分发动群众，开展扫尾高工效运动，突击施工。各县都抽调了得力干部到重点工程上去加强具体领导。广南县共抽出九名县级干部，分赴领导力量薄弱、施工进展迟缓的水利工地。他们帮助这些工地开展了“一条龙”的竞赛，工效大大提高，进度显著加快。坝南、董角、牧宜等八个水库，已经提前完工。其次是发动群众继续大闹工具改革，提高工效。如西畴县各水利工地由于普遍推广改良工具，每人平均工效（夯压方）突破了三立方米，施工进度突飞猛进。
    由于各级党委加强领导，大搞群众运动，一个水利工程扫尾的突击运动，已经在全州形成高潮。许多县虽然大批劳力下阵，但是施工进度却一跃再跃。文山县原来摆布在尚未完工的水利工程上的劳动力共四万人，现在已经按计划撤下两万人投入备耕活动，其余坚持在水利工地的民工们一致提出“人少也能多办事”的战斗口号，人人干劲十足，个个创造高工效。全县在民工减少一半的情况下，每日完成的土石方比过去增加一倍左右。全县原计划在2月底完工的工程，最近纷纷提前告捷，从2月1日到7日，相继完工的大中型工程已有四件，其余当年受益的工程，均可在2月底竣工。
