The Bumper Harvest Experience of a Hundred-Jin Ginned Cotton County
Wang Dian'an, County Head of Fugou County, Henan Province

Fugou County, Henan Province, is located in the heart of the Yellow River flooded area. In 1959, the county planted a total of 130,000 mu of cotton, accounting for 11% of the cultivated land area. Before liberation, the cotton yield per mu here remained at a level of just over ten jin (of ginned cotton). After liberation, the yield gradually increased, especially in 1959, the first year of the people's communes, when the increase was even greater. The county's average yield of ginned cotton reached 115 jin per mu, an increase of 1.6 times compared to 1958. Among them, 45,400 mu of high-yield cotton fields averaged 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu. This is the result of thoroughly and meticulously implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture and overcoming various difficulties and natural disasters.

In 1959, the characteristics of cotton growth in Fugou County were: dense and uniform planting, good ventilation and light transmission, tall plants, many fruit branches, large bolls, many cotton bolls, white cotton, no mildew, no rot, and less shedding of buds and bolls. Why did we achieve such a high cotton yield in 1959? The main reason is that we grasped the following six measures.

Taking Ideological Education as the Key Link

First, give prominence to politics and launch a mass movement. From sowing to cotton harvesting, from the county to the team and group, we took ideological education as the key link and adopted countermeasures for each stage. We launched a nationwide debate, adopting the method of debating whatever we were doing, to fully mobilize the masses; we formulated leap forward plans by checking, looking, calculating, and searching at each stage. And with the theory of continuous revolution as a guiding ideology, we fully estimated the subjective initiative of the people, so we were able to constantly propose new indicators based on the development of the situation, with one task following another, organizing the cotton production upsurge to be higher than the last. In the production movement, the county party committee put forward the grand slogan of "The whole party and the whole people grasp the cotton fields, exchange sweat for cotton balls, do everything possible to strive for a leap forward, and fight hard and skillfully to win the three passes (guarantee full planting and full seedlings, guarantee full bolls, and achieve a bumper harvest), with a momentum surpassing the Huaihai Campaign, determined to achieve a double-hundred (jin) cotton yield per mu," which further inspired the soaring enthusiasm of the commune members. In cotton field management, we focused on the central issues of the four periods, namely: (1) cotton sowing centered on turning the land into flat and garden-like fields; (2) seedling management centered on thinning and dense planting; (3) increasing the number of pre-summer bolls and ensuring the summer bolls centered on increasing buds and protecting bolls; (4) late-stage management centered on increasing and protecting bolls. According to the ideological situation of each different period, we organized a big airing of views, a big contending, and a big debate, and strictly criticized the erroneous ideas of emphasizing grain over cotton, reaching the top of production, dense planting not increasing production, excessive fertilization leading to crazy growth, and lack of confidence in eradicating pests. At the same time, we mobilized the whole people to find experience from the high-yield fields of 1958, find loopholes in the general fields, and then formulate a leap forward plan on this basis, setting off a "ten to the field" upsurge. "Ten to the field" means that meetings go to the field, output targets go to the field, measures go to the field, propaganda and education go to the field, cultural and recreational activities go to the field, red flag competitions go to the field, office work goes to the field, eating and lodging go to the field, medical care goes to the field, and delivery of goods goes to the field. All three cotton command posts of Xuan Yuan Commune moved to the fields; commune members of Chengguan Town delivered meals to the fields three times a day; teams of Lian Si Commune carried out red flag raising and lowering and red flag flow competitions, greatly boosting morale, improving work efficiency, and ensuring the successful completion of tasks in each management stage.

Secretaries Take the Lead in Building High-Yield Plots

Second, vigorously develop high-yield plots. The county and townships established cotton leap forward and production increase headquarters with the secretaries as the heads, set up special offices, and all brigades generally built command posts. Production teams had full-time cadres to lead cotton professional organizations. The county party committee established a hundred-mu command field in Zhaizhuang and a ten-thousand-mu high-yield area from Chengguan to Lian Si. Under the leadership of the county party committee, the county generally planned satellite fields and large-area high-yield plots based on soil and technical foundation, with large plots surrounding small plots, driving the large fields with the plots. The county established a total of 98 command fields, 355 high-yield plots, and 35 satellite plots, with a total area of ​​45,950 mu, accounting for 35% of the total cotton area. In management, the county party committee put forward the slogan of "Establish archives for every plot and every mu, build teaching stations on every road, one local expert for every thousand mu, one technician for every hundred mu, a marshal on every road, a general in every plot, and fix the troops and horses for every plot, with someone in charge of every row and every plant." The county promptly extracted three county party committee secretaries, five county party committee members, and fifteen commune party committee secretaries, as well as some commune party committee members, commune cadres, brigade cadres, and small team cadres to serve as leaders of high-yield plots, sections, and segments; extracted 11,442 laborers to form 854 professional teams to manage cotton fields by plots and ridges, and trained 2,437 technicians, 136 local experts, and technical cadres to jointly establish cotton technical teaching organizations and strengthen technical teaching. As a result, a scientific management of "marshals in large plots, generals in small plots, soldiers in every plot, everyone responsible, and no omissions" was launched in the county's cotton fields.

Establish Responsibility Systems and Carry Out Competition Movements

Third, implement five packages, six determinations, seven plans, five developments, and one establishment. Five packages: the county party committee packages large plots, the commune party committee packages small plots, the brigade packages sections, the production team packages blocks, and the commune members package ridges; six determinations: determine the land plot, determine the personnel, determine the targets, determine the measures, determine the quality, and determine the time; seven plans: plan labor and animal power, land plots, fertilizers, water sources, time, pesticides and agricultural machinery, and leadership; five developments: carry out inspection and evaluation, red flag competition, three visits to the thatched cottage, daily visits to talented people, and door-to-door apprenticeship movements; one establishment: establish a competitive arena from the commune to the individual. After Chengguan Town used the above methods, the commune members were very motivated and put forward the slogan of "Work hard and skillfully for a hundred days, determined to win the double-hundred pass, no matter how much sweat flows, determined to run ahead of Lian Si." The Ma Village Brigade of Lian Si Commune, after inspection and evaluation in late July, mustered up their energy, mobilized 350 commune members, and universally irrigated 700 mu of cotton fields once in one day and night, winning the red flag.

Innovate Sowing Techniques

Fourth, take the county party committee's cotton command field as a base to guide the county's timely sowing. The county promoted the innovation measures of "seven changes, three increases, and eightizations." The seven changes are: changing some low-lying areas that do not guarantee harvest into high and dry areas with convenient irrigation and drainage to guarantee production and harvest; changing sowing in mid-April to completing sowing from April 6th to 9th; changing single cropping to partial intercropping of cotton with sweet potatoes and peanuts; changing general application of base fertilizer to strip application along the furrow; changing short-toothed harrows to four-inch long-toothed harrows; changing east-west row sowing to north-south direction to increase ventilation and light transmission area; changing one-time sowing to double sowing to ensure uniform seed distribution. The three increases are: increasing the sowing amount from 15 jin last year to 20 jin, with 20 seeds per chi; increasing the depth of plowing from 7 inches in the past to 8 inches to 1 chi, deep plowing from 1 to 3 chi; increasing the planting area, planting every block and every mu to the end and to the edge, planting a circle around the tomb. The eightizations are: base fertilizer ten thousand jin-ization, increasing from 10,000 jin to 15,000 jin; achieving garden-like fields, with guaranteed harvest in drought and flood; wide and narrow row sowing-ization, changing from one chi six cun equidistant sowing to all large fields one chi two cun × one chi eight cun, high-yield fields three chi × one chi or two chi six cun × one chi four cun; seed three-selection-ization (plant selection, wind selection, grain selection), with cleanliness reaching over 95%; standardization of soaking and mixing seeds; unification of technician operation; stone roller compaction-ization; conscientious implementation of technical specifications-ization. Due to the conscientious implementation of the above measures, we achieved good cotton field planning, good deep plowing and deep turning to preserve moisture, good leveling of land, good seed treatment, good sowing methods, and good technical training.

Emphasize Increasing Buds, Increasing Bolls, and Increasing Cotton Boll Weight

Fifth, vigorously grasp the three summer bolls. During the eight months of cotton growth, Fugou County always implemented the production increase policy of "Taking bolls as the key link, planting more pre-summer bolls, ensuring summer bolls, and vigorously grasping autumn bolls." In different periods, we carried out cotton field management movements focusing on achieving "three mores" (more fruit branches, more bolls, more buds) and "two guarantees" (guaranteeing buds, guaranteeing bolls), and the county's cotton seedlings were generally upgraded through adding water, adding fertilizer, and adding labor. According to a survey on July 17 last year, general cotton fields carried bolls into the summer, with 1.5 to 3.7 bolls per plant, high-yield plots 4 to 6 bolls, and satellite fields 7 to 11 bolls, all exceeding the pre-summer bolls of previous years by 1 to 3 times; however, there was no rain for more than 70 days after the summer, resulting in severe shedding of buds and bolls. At this time, the people of the county rose up to fight drought and fought against the drought with the power to turn the tide. According to a survey on the Beginning of Autumn (August 8), the number of mid-summer bolls in high-yield fields reached 9 to 13 per plant, and 5 to 8 in general fields, and the shedding rate of buds and bolls decreased to about 25%. After the Beginning of Autumn, we launched the "Increase Seven and Seize Ten" boll-increasing and boll-protecting campaign, universally applied autumn boll fertilizer, and grasped the autumn bolls. After the End of Heat, the first-class cotton fields increased by 3 to 5 bolls, and the second-class increased by 2 to 4 bolls, achieving the requirement of full bolls, large bolls, and heavy bolls on the upper and lower parts of the cotton plant.

Vigorously Grasp Field Management

Sixth, vigorously grasp field management and promote the measures of "five earlies" and "five increases." That is: (1) Early middle tillage, increase depth: All cotton fields were cultivated for dream flowers when 70% of the seedlings emerged, 10 to 15 days earlier than in 1958, and diligent middle tillage and deep middle tillage were carried out. The depth was increased to 2.5 cun to 3 cun during the bud and boll stage, and all cotton fields were cultivated and earthed up 7 to 9 times; (2) Early topdressing, increase boll fertilizer: 4,000 jin of coarse fertilizer was topdressed during the flowering bud stage, and 40 jin of ammonium sulfate and 30 jin of phosphate fertilizer were additionally applied during the bud and boll stage, applied in two applications, one more application than in 1958; (3) Early thinning (three seedling determinations) to achieve rational close planting: In addition to satellite fields and high-yield fields, the area of cotton fields was increased from 3,500 plants in 1958 to 4,000 to 6,000 plants; (4) Early pest control: Conscientiously implement the central government's policy of "Comprehensive prevention and control, combining indigenous and foreign methods, comprehensively eliminating, focusing on clearing," and adopt the strategies and tactics of early treatment, small treatment, continuous treatment, and thorough elimination, launched five major battles, seven residual sweeps, and fiercely attacked and skillfully eliminated the four major pests of cotton aphids, ground tigers, cotton bollworms, and red spiders; (5) Timely topping to increase fruit branches: According to different types, three methods were adopted: that is, 10,000 jin of base fertilizer, a density of 3,800 to 4,000 plants, topped at the end of July; large density, less fertilizer, topped in mid-July; small density, more fertilizer, topped in early August.

    百斤皮棉县的丰产经验
    河南省扶沟县县长　王殿安
    河南扶沟县位于黄泛区腹心地带，全县1959年共种棉花十三万亩，占耕地面积的11％。解放前，这里的棉花亩产一直停留在十多斤（皮棉）的水平上。解放后，产量逐年有所提高，特别是实现人民公社化的第一年——1959年增产幅度更大，全县亩产皮棉达到一百一十五斤，比1958年增加了一点六倍。其中四万五千四百亩棉花丰产方，平均亩产皮棉二百斤。这是深入细致贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，战胜种种困难和自然灾害的结果。
    1959年，扶沟县棉花生长的特点是：密植均匀、通风透光好、棵高、果枝多、铃大、桃多、絮白，无霉、无烂、蕾铃脱落少。为什么1959年获得这样高的棉花产量？主要是抓住了以下的六项措施。
    以思想教育为纲
    第一、政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。从播种到棉花收获，由县到队、组，都是以抓思想教育为纲，段段采取对策。开展全民性的辩论，采取作啥辩论啥，以充分发动群众；段段通过查、看、算、找，以制定跃进规划。并以不断革命论作为指导思想，充分估计人民群众的主观能动性，因此能够根据形势发展，不断提出新的指标，一个任务紧接一个任务，把棉花生产高潮组织得一浪比一浪高。在生产运动中，县委提出了“全党全民抓棉田，以汗换回棉花团，千方百计争跃进，大干巧战夺三关（种保全苗，管保满桃，丰产丰收），声势赛过淮海战，决心亩产双百（斤）棉”的雄伟口号，进一步鼓舞了社员的冲天干劲。在棉田管理中，抓住四个时期的中心问题，即：（1）翻地平整园田化为中心的棉花播种；（2）间苗密植为中心的苗期管理；（3）多座伏前桃确保伏桃为中心的增蕾保铃；（4）增桃保桃为中心的后期管理。根据各个不同时期的思想情况，组织大鸣大放大辩论，严格批判重粮轻棉、增产到顶、密植不增产、施肥多疯长、根治虫害没信心等错误思想。同时发动全民从1958年丰产田中找经验，在一般大田中找漏洞，再在这个基础上制订跃进计划，掀起了“十到田”的热潮。“十到田”就是会议到田、产量指标到田、措施到田、宣传教育到田、文娱活动到田、红旗竞赛到田、办公到田、吃住到田、医疗到田、送货到田。轩辕公社三个棉花指挥部全部搬到田间；城关镇社员一天三餐送饭到田；练寺公社队队开展红旗升降和红旗流动竞赛，大鼓干劲，提高了工效，保证各个管理阶段的任务圆满完成。
    书记带头大建丰产方
    第二、大搞丰产方。县、乡都以书记为首建立了棉花跃进增产指挥部，下设专门办公室，各个大队普建指挥所，生产队都有专职干部领导棉花专业组织。县委在翟庄建立了一个百亩指挥田和从城关到练寺建立一个万亩丰产区。在县委的带动下，全县普遍根据土壤、技术基础，规划了卫星田，大面积丰产方，大方套小方，以方带动大田。全县总计建立指挥田九十八个，丰产方三百五十五个，卫星方三十五个，总面积四万五千九百五十亩，占棉田总面积的35％。在管理中，县委提出：“块块亩亩建档案，路路都建传授站，千亩一个土专家，百亩一个技术员，路路都有大元帅，方方都有大将官，块块兵马都固定，行行株株有人管”的口号。全县及时抽出三个县委书记、五个县委委员和十五个公社党委书记，以及一部分公社党委委员、公社干部、大队干部、小队干部分别担任丰产方、片、段的领导；抽出一万一千四百四十二名劳力组成八百五十四个专业队，分块分垅管理棉田，还培训二千四百三十七名技术员，一百三十六名土专家和技术干部，共同建立棉花技术传授组织，加强技术传授。从而全县棉田掀起了“大方有帅，小方有将，块块有兵，人人有责，点点不漏”的科学管理。建立责任制　开展竞赛运动
    第三、实行五包六定七规划、五开展、一树立。五包：县委包大方，公社党委包小方，大队包片，生产队包块，社员包垅；六定：定地块、定人员、定指标、定措施、定质量、定时间；七规划：规划劳力畜力、地块、肥料、水源、时间、农药农械和领导；五开展：开展检查评比、红旗竞赛、三顾茅庐、日日访贤、登门拜师运动；一树立：即由社到人树立对立竞赛面。城关镇运用上述办法后，社员干劲很高，提出了“大干巧干一百天，决心拿下双百关，任凭流下千斤汗，决心跑到练寺前”。练寺公社马村大队，在7月下旬检查评比后，鼓足了干劲，出动三百五十名社员，七百亩棉田一昼夜普遍浇水一遍，夺取了红旗。
    革新播种技术
    第四、以县委棉花指挥田作基地，指导全县适时播种。全县推行了“七改、三增和八化”的革新措施。七改是：部分不保收低洼地改为高燥灌排便利的保产保收地；4月中旬播种改为4月6—9日种完；单作改为部分棉花与红薯、花生间作；底肥普施改为随犁条施；短齿耙改为四寸长齿耙；东西行播种改为南北方向播，以增加通风透光面积；改一次丢种为双次丢种，确保籽粒均匀。三增为：播种量由去年十五斤增加到二十斤，尺尺有籽二十粒；耕翻地深度由以往耕地七寸增加为八寸至一尺，深翻一至三尺；增加种植面积，块块亩亩种到头、到边、坟墓周围种一圈。八化为：底肥万斤化，由一万斤增到一万五千斤；实现园田化，能灌能排，旱涝保丰收；宽窄行播种化，由一尺六寸等距播种，全部改为大田一尺二寸×一尺八寸，丰产田三尺×一尺或二尺六寸×一尺四寸；种子三选化（株选、风选、粒选），整洁度达95％以上；浸拌种籽规格化；技术员操作统一化；石滚镇压化；技术规格认真执行化。由于上述措施认真的执行，因而取得了棉田规划好、深耕深翻保墒好、平整土地好、种子处理好、播种方法好、技术训练好。
    增蕾增铃增桃重
    第五、大抓三伏桃。棉花生长的八个月期间，扶沟县始终贯彻执行了“以桃为纲，多座伏前桃，确保伏桃，大抓秋桃”的增产方针。在不同时期开展了以实现“三多”（果枝多、桃多、蕾多）“两保”（保蕾、保桃）为主要内容的增蕾保铃棉田管理运动，经过加水、加肥、加工，全县棉苗普遍升级。据去年7月17日调查，一般棉田带桃入伏，每棵有一点五到三点七个，丰产方四到六个，卫星田七到十一个，都超过历年伏前桃的一至三倍；但入伏后七十多天未雨，形成蕾铃脱落严重现象。这时全县人民奋起抗旱，以回天之力向旱象开展搏斗。据立秋（8月8日）调查，伏中桃丰产田每株达九至十三个，一般田五至八个，蕾铃脱落率下降为25％左右。立秋后，又开展“增七夺十”增桃保桃运动，普遍的增施了秋桃肥，抓住了秋桃。处暑后一类棉田增桃三至五个，二类增桃二至四个，实现了棉株上下满桃、桃大、桃重的要求。
    狠抓田间管理
    第六、大抓田间管理，推行“五早”“五增”措施。即：（1）早中耕，增深度：全部棉田在出苗70％时，进行锄梦花，比1958年提早十至十五天，并作到勤中耕、深中耕。蕾铃期增加深度达二点五寸至三寸，全部棉田中耕培土七至九遍；（2）早追肥，增桃肥：花蕾期追粗肥四千斤，蕾铃期增施硫铵四十斤，磷肥三十斤，分两次施入，比1958年增施一次；（3）早间苗（三次定苗），达到合理密植：除卫星田、丰产田外，大面积棉田在1958年三千五百株基础上增加到四千至六千株；（4）早治虫：认真贯彻执行中央提出的“全面防治，土洋结合，全面消灭，重点肃清”的方针，运用治早、治小、连续治、彻底消灭的战略战术，开展了五大战役，七次扫残，猛攻巧打，消灭了棉蚜虫、地老虎、棉铃虫、红蜘蛛四大虫害；（5）适时打顶，增加果枝：根据不同类型，采取三种方法：即底肥一万斤，密度三千八百至四千株，7月底打顶；密度大，肥料少，7月中旬打顶；密度小、肥料多，在8月上旬打顶。
