Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, February 8th. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is cultivating a large number of technical personnel for the technical transformation of animal husbandry.

The 280 tractor and combine drivers and other mechanical personnel already trained in the region have entered the major grasslands to prepare for the construction of new mechanized farms and the expansion of commune feed bases in pastoral areas this year.

The Inner Mongolia Animal Husbandry Mechanization School, located on the Xilingol Grassland, and the short-term training classes held by the autonomous region and various leagues are currently stepping up efforts to train 540 tractor drivers and other mechanical personnel.

State-owned ranches, grassland mechanical grass-growing stations, and people's communes on the major grasslands have equipped mechanical production teams and tractors with two sets of personnel to train drivers and mechanical personnel through the method of learning by doing.

The autonomous region has also sent a group of young people to various machinery factories and tractor repair shops inside and outside the region to learn the repair and assembly technology of various agricultural and animal husbandry machinery, in order to establish a mechanical repair and assembly network on the grasslands to serve the mechanization of animal husbandry.
