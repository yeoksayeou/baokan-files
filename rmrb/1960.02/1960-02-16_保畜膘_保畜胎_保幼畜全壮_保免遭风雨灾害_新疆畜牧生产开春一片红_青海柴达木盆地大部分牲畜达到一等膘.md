    Xinjiang's Livestock Production Opens with a Red Banner
    Most Livestock in Qinghai's Qaidam Basin Reach First-Class Fatness
    (Reported by this newspaper) Xinjiang's livestock production is off to a flying start this year. More than 20 million head of livestock across the region are strong and fat, fundamentally changing the historical situation where livestock lost significant weight during the winter. There has also been a bumper harvest of winter and early spring lambs. According to incomplete statistics, more than 800,000 lambs have been delivered in various areas, with a survival rate generally above 95%.
    Last year, Party organizations in various localities universally strengthened their leadership over livestock production. Taking advantage of the superiority of the People's Communes, they unified the planning of grasslands, resolving the difficulties of insufficient winter grazing pastures that had existed for years. Various areas also initially trained more than 5,000 commune and brigade cadres specifically responsible for livestock production, as well as more than 100,000 feeders and disease prevention workers, greatly improving the level of feeding and management. According to a survey by Altay Prefecture of the wintering situation of more than 500,000 head of livestock in Altay, Fuhai, Burqin, Jimunai, and Habahe counties, 75% were in first-class condition, an increase of 25% compared to the same period last year; 15% to 20% were in second-class condition; and only 5% to 10% were in third-class condition, a decrease of 20% compared to the same period last year. The number of miscarriages among pregnant large livestock has also significantly decreased compared to last year. In Zhaosu County, the famous Ili horse breeding area, miscarriages of horses and cattle accounted for more than 5% of eligible female livestock last year, but this has now dropped to 1.5%.
    Due to the thorough and detailed preparations for lambing in various communes, ewes are giving birth well. In the counties of Bayingoleng Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture on both sides of the Kaidu River, more than 30,000 lambs have already been born, with a survival rate as high as 97%. In Altay Prefecture, all 3,000 ewes that gave birth in the first batch on the Qinghai grassland saw all their lambs survive. Hami Prefecture has even produced five "all" sheep flocks: all mated, all pregnant, all delivered, all alive, and all strong.
    Now, even though the harsh winter has not yet passed on the thousands of miles of grassland in Xinjiang, the herdsmen of all ethnic groups are striving for an all-round red banner in the increase of all types of livestock, and are vigorously launching a major livestock protection campaign: first, ensure livestock are fat; second, ensure livestock are pregnant; third, ensure young livestock all live and grow strong; and fourth, ensure livestock are protected from wind and rain disasters.
    Xinhua News Agency, Xining Dispatch: Livestock production in the Qaidam area of Qinghai is developing rapidly. The total number of livestock of all types in the region has increased by a net 13.32% compared to 1958, and livestock in first-class condition account for more than 98% of the total number of livestock of all types. The Qaidam area has lush water and grass and vast grasslands. Party committees at all levels attach great importance to the development of livestock production, and have organized the broad masses of commune members to carry out seven competition movements according to the livestock production season, including lambing, fattening, mating, and cutting and storing forage grass, so that the annual livestock production is tightly linked and constantly advancing.
    The people's commune system has provided a fundamental guarantee for the rapid development of animal husbandry. The communes have given full play to the superiority of being large in size and having a high degree of public ownership, selected a large number of experienced herdsmen with good ideology to serve as herders, implemented the "four fixings" method of fixing people, livestock, grasslands, and tools, reduced the size of livestock groups, and grazed them according to livestock type, age, and sex; at the same time, they strengthened the feeding of sick, weak, pregnant, and young livestock. People's communes throughout the region actively implemented the policy of "livestock breeding as the main task, combined with agriculture and diverse operations," and universally engaged in a portion of agricultural production, which also played a great role in promoting the development of animal husbandry.
    As a result of the bumper harvest in animal husbandry, the people's communes mainly engaged in animal husbandry have greatly increased their income. The total income of Golmud Commune in Golmud City in 1959 more than doubled that of 1958, and the total income of Chaka Commune in Ulan County increased by 91%. The public accumulation of the communes has been further expanded, and this year they have all purchased new animal husbandry tools, added veterinary medicine and equipment for epidemic prevention, and built grassland water conservancy projects, laying a good foundation for achieving greater development in animal husbandry production.

### 保畜膘　保畜胎　保幼畜全壮　保免遭风雨灾害  新疆畜牧生产开春一片红  青海柴达木盆地大部分牲畜达到一等膘

    保畜膘　保畜胎　保幼畜全壮　保免遭风雨灾害
    新疆畜牧生产开春一片红
    青海柴达木盆地大部分牲畜达到一等膘
    本报讯　新疆畜牧业生产开春一片红。全区两千多万头牲畜体壮膘肥，历史上牲畜过冬体膘显著下降的状况得到基本改变；冬羔和早春羔也得到大丰产，根据不完全统计，各地接产的羔羊已有八十多万只，成活率一般在95％以上。
    去年各地党组织就普遍加强了对畜牧业生产的领导，运用人民公社的优越性，统一规划了草原，解决了历年来牲畜越冬牧场不足的困难。各地还初步训练了五千多名公社、大队专管畜牧生产的干部，以及十万多名饲养员和防疫员，大大提高了饲养管理水平。据阿勒泰专区对阿勒泰、福海、布尔津、吉木乃、哈巴河五县五十多万头牲畜越冬情况的检查，一类膘占75％，比去年同期增加了25％；二类膘占15％—20％；三类膘只占5％—10％，比去年同期减少了20％。怀胎大畜流产的情况也比去年显著降低。著名的伊犁马产地昭苏县，去年流产的马、牛占适龄母畜的5％以上，今年已经下降到1．5％。
    由于各公社接羔准备工作深入细致，母羊产羔情况良好。开都河两岸的巴音郭楞蒙古族自治州各县，已产三万多只羊羔，成活率高达97％。阿勒泰专区青海草原上第一批产羔的三千只母羊，羔羊全部成活。哈密专区并且涌现出了五个全配、全怀、全产、全活、全壮的“五全”羊群。
    现在新疆数千里草原上严冬还未过去，各族牧民正在力争各类牲畜增殖满堂红，轰轰烈烈地展开了一保畜膘，二保畜胎，三保幼畜全活全壮，四保牲畜免遭风雨灾害的保畜大竞赛。
    据新华社西宁电　青海柴达木地区畜牧业生产迅速发展。全区现有各类牲畜的总数比1958年净增13．32％，一类膘的牲畜占各类牲畜总数的98％以上。柴达木地区水草丰美、草原辽阔，各级党委十分重视畜牧业生产的发展，组织广大社员根据畜牧业生产季节，开展了接羔、抓膘、配种、割贮饲草等七次竞赛运动，使全年畜牧业生产一环紧套一环，不断前进。
    人民公社化为畜牧业迅速发展提供了根本的保证。各公社充分发挥一大二公的优越性，选择了大批思想好、放牧经验丰富的劳动牧民担任放牧员，实行定人、定畜、定草原、定工具的“四定”办法，划小畜群，按牲畜类别、老幼、公母分群放牧；同时，加强了病、弱、孕、幼牲畜的饲养工作。全区各人民公社积极贯彻“以牧为主，农牧结合，发展多种经营”的方针，普遍经营了一部分农业生产，对畜牧业的发展也起了很大的促进作用。
    由于畜牧业生产获得大丰收，以经营畜牧业为主的人民公社都大大增加了收入。格尔木市的格尔木公社1959年的总收入比1958年增加了一倍多，乌兰县茶卡公社总收入增加了91％。各公社的公共积累更加扩大，今年都纷纷购买了新式畜牧业工具，添置兽疫防治药械，兴修草原水利，为争取畜牧业生产更大发展打下了良好基础。
