Philosophy is a Magic Weapon
Zhang Cai, member of Bai Kui People's Commune, Hulan, Heilongjiang

At the cadre meeting discussing the 1959 production plan, I said with confidence, "This target can definitely be achieved, and the masses will definitely agree." But things were not as simple as I imagined. When it was conveyed to the commune members, many people supported the target, but some disagreed, and some even said with certainty, "This target cannot be achieved!" Although those who said this had no basis, their words made other commune members hesitate, and the target could not be set. As the propaganda officer of the production team, I was very anxious when I saw this situation. How could this problem be solved? At this time, I remembered what I had learned when studying Chairman Mao's philosophical works not long ago: everything in the world contains contradictions, and the change and development of contradictions promote the change and development of things. People should be good at observing and analyzing contradictions, and find ways to resolve contradictions based on this analysis. Thinking of this, my mind became clear. Am I not encountering a contradiction now? This is the contradiction between the advanced production target and the conservative thinking of some commune members. How should this contradiction be resolved? I analyzed that the reason for the contradiction was that some commune members did not have a sufficient understanding of the favorable conditions, and they saw more difficulties. In addition, our method of conveying the target was simple, and we did not explain what the target was based on. Having found the reason, I went further to find a solution. Contradictions can be transformed, so the conservative thinking of commune members can also be overcome, and negative factors can be turned into positive factors! But the transformation of contradictions must have conditions, and this is to change the working methods to promote the transformation of contradictions, to turn backwardness into advancement, to turn negativity into positivity, and to make advanced production targets the targets of the masses themselves.

Having understood this principle, I was full of energy. So, our production team held a meeting to discuss the target. At the beginning of the discussion, we put the production target aside temporarily and talked about the reasons for the great harvest in 1958. At the discussion meeting, commune members scrambled to speak. Everyone said, "Last year, the sorghum in front of the door yielded an average of more than 900 jin per mu!" "There was a lot of manure on that land, a pile in front of the cart and a pile behind the cart." Someone added, "That land was hoed many times and topdressing was also applied!" "Last year, there was a severe drought for forty days without a drop of rain, and scarabs pulled out many seedlings! But these difficulties were overcome, and it did not hinder the increase in production." When talking about the favorable conditions in 1959, everyone said, "This year there is autumn plowing, but there was none last year." "This year there are ready-made wells, and we can irrigate if there is a drought." "This year there is more manure than last year."...

In this way, the experience of the great harvest in 1958 turned into a guarantee for continued high yields in the minds of the commune members; the fact that natural disasters were overcome in 1958 also strengthened people's confidence in overcoming the difficulties in 1959. Finally, everyone affirmed that the favorable conditions in 1959 were even greater than in 1958. The commune members' attitude towards the advanced production target changed from doubt to confidence, and some people even said, "We can surpass it if we work harder!"

The advanced production target is no longer a problem in the minds of the vast majority of commune members. This has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the commune members. People who did not accept the new target before have become supporters of the new target. People who used to take the light work and avoid the heavy work a few days ago are now rushing to do the work. Isn't this all a transformation of contradictions? This is really an exciting thing!

This incident made me realize that studying philosophy well, using philosophical viewpoints to analyze problems and deal with problems, can make our work better and promote the continuous great leap forward in production. Philosophy is a magic weapon! [Originally published in Heilongjiang Daily]

    哲学是法宝
    黑龙江呼兰白奎人民公社社员　张才
    在讨论1959年生产计划的干部大会上，我满有信心地说：“这个指标一定能达到，群众一定会赞成”。可是事情并不像我想像的那样简单，向社员一传达，许多人拥护这个指标，可也有一部分人不赞成，还有人肯定地说：“这个指标达不到！”这样说的人，虽然没有什么根据，但是他们这样一说，另一部分社员也犹豫起来，指标定不下来。我是生产队的宣传员，看到这一情况，心里很是着急，怎样解决这个问题呢？这时我想起不久前学习毛主席的哲学著作时学过：世界万物都存在着矛盾，矛盾的变化和发展推动了事物的变化和发展，人们应当善于去观察和分析矛盾，并根据这种分析，找出解决矛盾的方法。想到这里，我的头脑清醒了。现在我不就是遇到了一个矛盾吗？这就是先进的生产指标和部分社员的保守思想的矛盾。这个矛盾应当怎样解决呢？我分析产生矛盾的原因是：部分社员对有利条件认识不够，对困难看的多，加上我们在传达指标时方法简单，没讲清这个指标是根据什么订的。找到了原因，我又进一步去找解决问题的办法。矛盾是可以转化的，那末，社员的保守思想也是可以克服的，把消极因素变为积极因素呀！但是矛盾的转化还得有条件，这就是要改变工作方法，去促使矛盾的转化，变落后为先进，变消极为积极，使先进的生产指标成为群众自己的指标。
    想通了这个道理，我浑身都有劲了。于是，我们生产队就开会讨论指标。在开始讨论时，我们把生产指标暂时放在一旁不谈，先大谈取得1958年大丰收的原因。在讨论会上社员争着发言。大家说：“去年门前那块高粱平均一亩打九百多斤哪！”“那块地上粪多，车前一堆车后一堆的。”又有人补充说：“那地铲的遍数多，还追肥了呢！”“去年大旱四十天没下一点雨，还让蛴螬拉掉不少苗！可这些困难都克服了，也没妨碍增产。”在谈到1959年的有利条件时，大伙说：“今年有秋翻地，去年没有。”“今年有现成的井，旱了就浇。”“今年比去年粪肥多。”……
    就这样，1958年大丰收的经验，在社员的心里变成了继续丰产的保证条件了；1958年战胜自然灾害的事实，也增强了人们克服1959年困难的信心。最后，大家肯定了1959年比1958年的有利条件更多。社员对先进生产指标由怀疑转为有信心了，有的人还说：“加把油还能超过呢！”
    先进生产指标，在绝大部分社员思想中已不成问题了。从而大大鼓舞了社员的干劲，原来不接受新指标的人成了新指标的拥护者，前几天干活拿轻躲重的人，现在抢活干。这不都是矛盾的转化吗？这真是一件令人兴奋的事呀！
    这件事使我认识到：学好哲学，运用哲学的观点来分析问题、处理问题，才能把工作做得更好，才能促进生产的持续大跃进。哲学是法宝！　〔原载黑龙江日报〕
