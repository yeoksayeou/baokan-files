    Ordering Ten Thousand Waters to Return to the Fields to Fight Spring Drought
    Henan Simultaneously Focuses on Water Conservancy Project Completion and Vigorous Well-Drilling
    (Our newspaper Zhengzhou, 25th dispatch) To combat the spring drought, the broad masses of the people in Henan Province are both utilizing various water conservancy construction projects and opening up new water sources, vigorously drilling wells to bring ten thousand waters back to the fields, greatly accelerating the progress of spring irrigation. As of February 20, according to statistics from the four special districts of Nanyang, Xuchang, Xinxiang, and Kaifeng, and the Zhengzhou city area, the wheat fields that have been irrigated with returning green water account for more than 80% of the total wheat field area. Due to the early spring irrigation, although the spring drought continues to develop, wheat in some areas is still returning to green early.
    At the beginning of February, after the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the call to the people of the province to "defeat the spring drought and ensure a great summer harvest" and to "establish a long-term drought resistance ideology," the anti-drought wheat irrigation movement surged, and the army of wheat field management quickly increased to more than 7.2 million people. Due to the lack of rain and snow last year, all localities attach importance to giving full play to the benefits of existing water conservancy projects, so as to realize the systematization and matching of water conservancy projects. Nanyang Special District has built more than 300,000 water conservancy projects in recent years, of which more than 260,000 have been completed; this year, combined with spring irrigation, more than 26,000 new sets have been completed, expanding the irrigation area by more than 230,000 mu. Tangyin County in Xinxiang Special District mobilized more than 92,000 laborers, and in nine days, they built all the main and branch canals for twelve medium and small reservoirs without canals. For 139 medium and small backbone canals with main canals but no branch canals, branch and capillary canals were excavated. More than 500 wells were newly drilled for more than 10,000 mu of wheat fields without water sources. Using these projects, more than 250,000 mu of wheat have been irrigated with returning green water, and more than 120,000 mu of cotton fields have been irrigated with collapsing moisture water. While vigorously carrying out the completion of water conservancy projects, a water conservancy construction movement centered on drilling wells is even more powerful and progressing rapidly. The province has organized nearly one million well-drilling teams, and statistics as of the 15th show that more than 13,000 new wells have been drilled. Xuchang Special District, which has the fastest well-drilling speed, has completed more than 5,200 wells in just over ten days, completing more than a quarter of the task of 20,000 wells. After completing the task of the first one million mu of wells, Nanyang Special District has newly planned three million mu of wells, striving to achieve double insurance of wells and canals for 10 million mu of cultivated land in the entire district by the end of May.
    In the current anti-drought spring irrigation movement, the masses in mountainous, hilly, and highland areas with difficult water sources universally apply the methods used in last year's anti-drought and autumn protection struggle, such as splitting mountains to block rivers, digging mountain springs, opening ring mountain canals, building bridges over ditches, chiseling mountains and piercing ridges, using waterwheel groups, hoisting pole forests, windlasses, and bringing all kinds of basins and cans into battle to fight against the spring drought and vow to win a great summer wheat harvest. Wenjiazhuang Production Team of Hejian Commune in Linxian County, Xinxiang Special District, has more than 400 mu of land lacking water sources. The team leader, Fu Tingtai, led 24 technicians to traverse the mountains and valleys and discovered a mountain spring in Hongshan Temple, but it was separated by a deep ditch, and the water could not flow over. The commune members used wooden boards to build an artificial river that was 3.7 zhang high, 1.8 zhang long, and 0.25 zhang wide to bring the spring over, expanding the irrigated area by 370 mu. Yanshi County in Luoyang Special District lifted water up to a 40 zhang high ridge, turning 500 mu of ridge land that had never been irrigated into self-flowing irrigation. Nanyang area proposed five increases (increase leadership, labor, water sources, tools, and cooperation) for areas with weak spring irrigation and areas with difficult water sources, and added more than 2,000 cadres at all levels, supported 180,000 laborers and more than 20,000 tools, and carried out more than 9,000 projects to draw water to the ridges, which has irrigated 1.26 million mu of land, accounting for 60% of the water-deficient area.
    In order to ensure the quality of spring irrigation, all localities have organized large-scale evaluations and inspections. Twelve counties in Kaifeng Special District formed more than 5,000 inspection teams to go deep into communes and teams to inspect block by block. They found that more than 420,000 mu were unevenly or insufficiently irrigated and all were re-irrigated. The counties in Xuchang Special District also organized experience evaluation and inspection teams to exchange experiences and promote backward areas to catch up. (Fang Huang)

    喝令万水归田抗春旱
    河南既抓水利工程配套又大打机井
    本报郑州25日电　河南省广大人民，为了战胜春旱，一面利用各种水利建设工程，一面新开辟水源，大打机井，使万水归田，大大加快了春浇进度。截至2月20日止，据南阳、许昌、新乡、开封四个专区和郑州市地区统计，已浇返青水的麦田占麦田总面积的80％以上。由于提早春浇，虽然春旱继续发展，有的地区小麦依然提早返青。
    2月初，当中共河南省委向全省人民发出“战胜春旱，保证夏季大丰收”和“树立长期抗旱思想”的号召以后，抗旱浇麦运动风起云涌，麦田管理大军很快就增加到七百二十多万人。由于去年雨雪少，各地都重视充分发挥现有水利工程的效益，使实现水利工程系统化、配套化。南阳专区几年来兴修三十多万处水利工程，已配成套的二十六万多处；今年结合春浇又新配成套二万六千多处，扩大灌溉面积二十三万多亩。新乡专区汤阴县动员了九万二千多名劳力，九天把十二个没有渠道的中、小型水库全部建了干、支渠，一百三十九条有干渠没有支渠的中、小型骨干渠，都开挖了支、毛渠，没有水源的一万多亩麦田，新打了五百多眼井。利用这些工程，已浇小麦返青水二十五万多亩，棉田塌墒水十二万多亩。在大搞水利工程配套的同时，一个以打机井为中心的水利建设运动更是声势浩大，进展迅速。全省组织了将近百万人的打井专业队，到15日统计，已新打机井一万三千多眼。打机井速度最快的许昌专区，短短十多天内，已打成机井五千二百多眼，完成两万眼机井任务的四分之一还多。南阳专区在完成第一个百万亩机井方的任务后，又新规划了三个百万亩机井方，争取到5月底，全区一千万亩耕地实现井渠双保险。
    在当前开展抗旱春浇运动中，水源困难的山区、丘陵区、高岗地区群众，普遍运用去年抗旱保秋斗争中劈山闸河、挖山泉、开环山渠道、过沟搭桥、凿山穿岭，运用水车群、吊杆林、辘轳阵，盆盆罐罐齐上阵办法，大战春旱，誓夺小麦夏季大丰收。新乡专区林县合涧公社温家庄生产队有四百多亩地缺少水源，队长傅亭太带领二十四名技术员，踏遍群山大壑，在洪山寺发现了一个山泉，但中间隔一道深沟，水流不过去，社员们就用木板架设了一个高三丈七尺，长一丈八尺，宽二尺五寸的人工河，把泉引过来，扩大浇地面积三百七十亩。洛阳专区偃师县引水上岗四十丈高，把从来没有浇过水的五百亩岗地，变成自流灌溉。南阳地区对春浇薄弱地区和水源困难的地区提出五增（增领导、劳力、水源、工具、协作），加派了各级干部二千多人，支援劳力十八万人、工具二万多件，大搞引水上岗工程九千多处，已浇地一百二十六万亩，占缺水面积的60％。
    为了保证春浇质量，各地都组织大评比、大检查。开封专区十二个县，组成五千多个检查团，深入社、队，逐块检查，发现有四十二万多亩浇的不匀不透，又全部进行了补浇。许昌专区各县也组织了经验评比检查团，一面交流经验，一面推动后进地区迎头赶上。		（方徨）
