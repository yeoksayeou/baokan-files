    天津第一钢厂开展“生产运动会”
    保证钢和钢材全面完成首季计划
    据新华社天津27日电　天津第一钢厂全体职工响应北京石景山钢铁公司的倡议，保证提前全面地超额完成第一季度钢和钢材的产量、质量、原材料消耗、成本、安全等各项计划指标，充分做好第二季度生产准备工作，掀起轰轰烈烈的钢铁生产新高潮。
    现在，这个厂的职工正热火朝天地开展着“春季生产运动会”。工厂成立了指挥部，制定了评比条件；各个车间、工种都涌现出了在生产和技术革新中有新创造的“运动健将”。全厂最薄弱的环节运输和装卸部门，已在1、2月份基本上摆脱了体力劳动，机械化和半机械化的程度已达90％。全厂的轧钢机也大部分实现了自动化和半自动化。为了响应石景山钢铁公司的倡议，这个厂的职工又提出四十条先进经验，准备从3月份起在厂内各个主要工段推广，进一步提高钢的生产水平。
