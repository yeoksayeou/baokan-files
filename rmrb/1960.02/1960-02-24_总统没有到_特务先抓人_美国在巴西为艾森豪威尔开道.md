　　Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd Dispatch from Rio de Janeiro: Approximately four hundred U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation agents, plus ten thousand Brazilian police and plainclothes officers, will be responsible for Eisenhower's personal security during his visit to Brazil.

　　The work of arresting "suspects" is underway, as part of the security plan during Eisenhower's visit.

　　If necessary, the U.S. President and his entourage will use helicopters transported by the U.S. military ship "Plymouth Rock." The "Plymouth Rock," along with the cruiser "Macon," has already sailed to Prata City.

　　In Botafogo Bay, a special landing field for helicopters has been built using the seawall. This area is absolutely off-limits to the public, and it is only three hundred meters away from the U.S. Embassy. No one except for the reception personnel and Eisenhower's entourage can approach him. Journalists must wear special badges on their collars to enter the event locations.

　　After Eisenhower arrives at the Palácio da Alvorada, it will be considered U.S. territory. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is responsible for security work and prohibits anyone from approaching the presidential palace in Brasilia.

    总统没有到　特务先抓人
    美国在巴西为艾森豪威尔开道
    新华社23日讯　据拉丁美洲通讯社里约热内卢消息：大约四百名美国联邦调查局的特务加上一万名巴西警察和便衣警察，将负责艾森豪威尔在巴西访问期间的个人安全。
    逮捕“嫌疑犯”的工作正在进行，这是艾森豪威尔访问期间安全计划的一部分。
    在必要的情况下，美国总统及其随行人员将使用美国军舰“普利茅斯罗克号”运来的直升飞机。“普利茅斯罗克号”同“麦孔”号巡洋舰现已开往普拉塔城。
    在博塔福戈古湾，已经利用海堤修好了供直升飞机着陆的特殊的降落场。这个地区绝对禁止公众接近，它距离美国大使馆仅仅三百米。除接待人员和艾森豪威尔的随行人员外，任何人都不能接近他。新闻记者的领子上均得佩戴特别标记，才能进入举行活动的地点。
    在艾森豪威尔到达阿耳多拉达宫后，这里将被认为是美国领土。联邦调查局负责安全工作，并且禁止任何人接近巴西利亚的总统府。
