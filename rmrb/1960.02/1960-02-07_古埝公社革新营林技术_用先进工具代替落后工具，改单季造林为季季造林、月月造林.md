　　Hefei, February 6th (reporter of this newspaper) The Gu Nian Commune in She County, located in the mountainous area of southern Anhui, has greatly improved the efficiency of seed collection, sowing, and pit digging during winter and spring afforestation due to the creation of a batch of advanced afforestation tools. This accelerated the progress of afforestation, and by January 20th, the commune had exceeded its winter-spring afforestation task by 50%.

　　In the past, Gu Nian Commune was accustomed to afforestation only in the spring. However, the commune has many mountains but few people, and there is a severe shortage of labor. If a portion of the people were diverted to afforestation every spring, it would affect spring plowing production. To overcome this contradiction, the commune members innovated forestry production techniques, changing from single-season afforestation to season-by-season, month-by-month afforestation. They also created a batch of advanced afforestation tools, providing favorable conditions for the development of forestry production.

　　The afforestation tools manufactured by this commune are generally very efficient. Among the new tools, the seed collector, which can extend and contract freely and has automatically opening scissors, can collect more than 400 catties of tree seeds per day, more than a dozen times the 30 catties collected by one person manually; the lightweight and flexible nursery seeder can sow more than 9 mu per day, more than twenty times the four fen of land sown manually per day; and the tree planting device suitable for digging pits in hard soil can dig pits and take soil, allowing one person to dig 80 to 100 large pits per day, four times faster than manual labor.

　　In order to further promote these new tools, the commune party committee has organized four on-site meetings. At present, the commune's seed collectors and other tools have been widely used in practice and are welcomed by the vast number of commune members.

    古埝公社革新营林技术
    用先进工具代替落后工具，改单季造林为季季造林、月月造林
    本报合肥6日电　位置于皖南山区的歙县古埝公社，在冬春造林中，由于创制了一批先进造林工具，大大提高了采种、播种、挖坑等工作效率，加快了造林的进度，到1月20日，已超额50％完成去冬今春的造林任务。
    古埝公社过去一向只习惯在春季造林，但全公社山多人少，劳动力很缺，如果每年春季抽一部分人造林，就会影响春耕生产。为了克服这个矛盾，社员们革新了林业生产技术，除了改变过去单季造林为季季造林、月月造林以外，还创造了一批造林先进工具，给发展林业生产提供了有利的条件。
    这个公社制造的造林工具一般效率很高。新工具中的能长短伸缩自如、剪刀自动开张的采种器，一天能采树种四百多斤，为人工一天采三十斤的十几倍；轻巧灵便的苗圃播种机，一天能播九亩以上，为人工一天播种四分地的二十多倍；适合在土质坚硬的地方刨坑的植树器，能刨坑又能取土，一人一天能挖大坑八十至一百个，比人工快四倍。
    这个公社党委为了进一步推广这些新工具，先后组织了四次现场会议。目前，全社的采种器等工具已在实际中普遍使用，并受到了广大社员的欢迎。
