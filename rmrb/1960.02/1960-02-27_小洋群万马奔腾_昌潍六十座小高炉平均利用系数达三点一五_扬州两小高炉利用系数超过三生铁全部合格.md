Small Blast Furnaces Gallop Ahead Like Ten Thousand Horses
    Changwei's Sixty Small Blast Furnaces Achieve Average Utilization Coefficient of 3.15
    Yangzhou's Two Small Blast Furnaces Exceed Utilization Coefficient of Three; All Pig Iron Meets Standards
    (Our Newspaper) News: The broad masses of workers on the iron and steel front in the Changwei Special District of Shandong Province have comprehensively, systematically, and completely studied and promoted the advanced experience of high yield, high quality, and low cost from the small blast furnace in the Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory's smelting workshop, bringing about a new situation of sustained leap forward in pig iron production. In January, the average daily pig iron output of the entire district increased by 6.7% compared to December of last year, and the daily output level in the first ten days of February increased by 13.1% compared to the entire month of January. The average utilization coefficient of the district's eighty-three blast furnaces reached 2.02, the pig iron pass rate reached 91%, and the coke consumption per ton of iron dropped to 0.96 tons. Among them, the sixty frequently operated 3-cubic-meter small blast furnaces achieved an average utilization coefficient of 3.15, a pass rate of 90%, and a coke ratio of 0.91, creating a new record of large-scale high yield.
    In ironmaking production, Changwei District adopted the method of focusing on breakthroughs and driving the general, strengthening leadership in promoting advanced experiences. Each steel plant established a leading group or committee to promote advanced experiences. Leading cadres of party committees at all levels personally went to the furnace front and used the "three combinations" method to carry out "experimental furnaces" to gain experience and promote it comprehensively. The secretary furnaces and pacesetter furnaces of each iron and steel plant played a demonstrative role with their excellent production performance. For example, from February 1st to 13th, the average utilization coefficient of the No. 48 3-cubic-meter pacesetter furnace of Weifang No. 3 Steel Plant reached 6.23, the pig iron pass rate was 100%, and the coke consumption per ton of iron was 0.55 tons.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, February 26th: The average utilization coefficient of the two 8-cubic-meter small blast furnaces of the Lingyanshan Steel Plant in Yangzhou, Jiangsu, reached 3.04 in January, the pig iron pass rate was 100%, the average coke ratio was reduced to 0.89 tons, and the cost was also reduced to within the state allocation price.
    The workers of these two small blast furnaces worked hard to learn and promote the advanced experiences of fraternal units, and also displayed a high degree of creativity, enabling the blast furnaces to continuously achieve high quality and high yield. For example, when they began to promote the operating experience of large air volume and high air temperature, the workers carefully studied the performance of equipment such as hot blast stoves and motors, and boldly conducted experiments, taking technical measures such as parallel connection of two machines, multi-nozzle combustion, and enlarged air ducts according to the furnace conditions, so that the blast furnace air temperature increased to 600 degrees and the air pressure increased to 262 mercury columns, achieving safe and high production.

    小洋群万马奔腾
    昌潍六十座小高炉平均利用系数达三点一五
    扬州两小高炉利用系数超过三生铁全部合格
    本报讯　山东省昌潍专区钢铁战线上的广大职工，全面地系统地整套地学习和推广了济南印染厂冶炼车间小高炉的高产、优质、低成本的先进经验，使生铁生产出现了持续跃进的新局面。1月份全区生铁平均日产量比去年12月份提高6．7％，2月上旬的日产水平又比1月份全月提高13．1％。全区八十三座高炉平均利用系数达到二点零二，生铁合格率达到91％，每吨铁消耗的焦炭降至零点九六吨。其中，经常开炉的六十座三立方米小高炉，平均利用系数达到三点一五，合格率达到90％，焦比降到零点九一，创造了大面积高产的新纪录。
    昌潍地区在炼铁生产中，采取了重点突破、带动一般的方法，加强了推广先进经验的领导。每个钢铁厂都建立了推广先进经验的领导小组或委员会。各级党委的领导干部亲临炉前，用“三结合”的方法大搞“试验炉”取得经验，全面推广。各炼铁厂的书记炉、标兵炉，以优异的生产成绩发挥了示范作用。如潍坊第三钢铁厂四十八号三立方米标兵炉，2月1日至13日，平均利用系数达到六点二三，生铁合格率100％，每吨铁耗用焦炭零点五五吨。
    据新华社南京26日电　江苏扬州灵岩山钢铁厂两只八立方米的小高炉，1月份的平均利用系数达到了三点零四，生铁合格率为百分之一百，平均焦比降低到零点八九吨，成本也降到国家调拨价以内。
    这两座小高炉的职工努力学习和推广兄弟单位的先进经验，并且发挥了高度创造精神，使高炉不断夺得优质高产。如在开始推广大风量、高风温操作经验时，工人们细心研究了热风炉、电动机等设备的性能，大胆地进行试验，因炉制宜地采取了双机并联、多嘴燃烧、放大风管等技术措施，使高炉风温提高到六百度、风压提高到二百六十二个水银柱，做到了安全高产。
