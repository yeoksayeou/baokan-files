Xinhua News Agency, January 31st. Beijing's Changdian, a traditional Spring Festival amusement venue with a history of over 300 years, is welcoming visitors this year with an unprecedented new look thanks to the organization and comprehensive arrangements of the Party and the government.

The Changdian Market—the three-li long street from Hepingmen to Hufangqiao in Beijing—has been crowded with tourists these days. According to statistics from the Changdian Management Committee, the day with the most visitors last year reached 300,000, and the total number of visitors in the first three days of this Spring Festival has reached more than 1.7 million.

On the roads leading to Changdian, tourists are in high spirits, some carrying five- or six-foot-long candied hawthorns, some holding various balloons, and some shaking clattering multi-wheeled windmills. Children playfully wear newly bought masks on their faces.

This is truly an "exhibition of people's lives." On more than 600 large and small stalls in more than 30 categories, thousands of commodities are displayed, with both the variety and quantity increasing significantly compared to last year. The number of snacks alone has increased from 35 last year to more than 60. People can buy Beijing's local specialties here, taste Guangdong's sugarcane, Shandong's crisp pears, Jiangxi's kumquats, and choose Fujian's daffodils and Shanghai's orchids... Many commodities have restored and developed the traditional style of Changdian. Foods such as "fried turnovers" and "fried meat pies," which had ceased production and been out of stock for many years before liberation, have been relaunched this year. More than ten state-owned department stores, including the Beijing Department Store, have set up temporary sales stations in Changdian for the first time this year. A prominent chart on Changdian Street illustrates: Changdian has become more prosperous year by year since liberation. During the Spring Festival of 1953, the total sales volume of Changdian for fifteen days was 28,000 yuan; during the Spring Festival of 1959, the total sales volume for fifteen days rose to 300,000 yuan; and in the first two days of this Spring Festival, the sales volume reached more than 120,000 yuan.

Gongs and drums and suonas play folk tunes, attracting groups of tourists to more than ten amusement venues. Young audiences surround and watch "peep shows," and "dough figurine makers" perform stunts in public. Amateur literary and artistic activists from workers are performing a newly compiled crosstalk "Leap Forward Family." Laughter and applause are constantly heard in the daytime cinema and acrobatics field. In front of the Xinhua Bookstore's book stalls, people are selecting books and periodicals on theory and literature, with picture books and New Year pictures being the bestsellers. People who love calligraphy and painting appreciate the newly displayed works of painters from past dynasties and Qing Dynasty "ink treasures" at the famous Rongbaozhai. The street exhibitions such as "A General History of China," "Ten Years of Achievements of the Motherland," and "Mass Amateur Literary and Artistic Creations" held by the Chinese History Museum, the Lu Xun Museum, and the Xuanwu District Cultural Center, are attracting dense crowds of viewers. An old visitor to Changdian left a poem after seeing the exhibition: "I visit Changdian every year, it's better every year, we must go all out and continue to leap forward, adding brilliance to perfection."

    三华里的大街布满游人
    北京厂甸景象空前繁荣
    新华社31日讯　北京市具有三百多年历史的春节传统游乐场所——厂甸，经过党和政府的组织和全面安排，今年以从未有过的新面貌迎接着游人。
    厂甸市场——从北京和平门到虎坊桥长达三华里的大街上，这几天游人拥拥挤挤。据厂甸管理委员会统计，去年游人最多的一天达到三十万人次，今年春节头三天游人总数已达一百七十多万人次。
    在通往厂甸的各条道路上，游人们兴高彩烈，有的扛着五、六尺长的大糖葫芦，有的举着各式各样的气球，有的摇着??作响的多轮风车，小孩子们把刚买到的假面具罩在脸上嘻戏。
    这里真是一个“人民生活展览会”。在三十多类、六百多个大小货摊上，陈列着几千种商品，无论品种与数量都比去年增加很多。仅小吃一项就由去年的三十五种增加到六十多种。人们从这里可以买到北京的土特产品，也能够尝到广东的甘蔗、山东的酥梨、江西的金桔，选购到福建的水仙和上海的兰花……。许多商品恢复和发扬了厂甸传统的风格。解放以前就停止生产、脱销多年的“炸回头”、“炸肉饼”等食品，今年又重新上市了。北京市百货大楼等十多个国营商场今年第一次在厂甸设置了临时售货站。厂甸街头一幅醒目的大图表说明：解放后厂甸一年比一年兴隆，1953年春节，厂甸十五天的销货总额为二万八千元；1959年春节十五天的销货总额上升到三十万元；今年春节头两天的销货额就达到了十二万多元。
    锣鼓和唢呐奏着民间小调，把一群群游人吸引到十多个游艺场去。小观众们围着观看“西洋景”，“面人郎”当众表演绝技。工人业余文艺活动积极分子在说新编的相声“跃进家庭”。白昼电影放映室和杂技场里，不断传来笑声和喝采声。新华书店售书摊前，人们在选购理论、文艺等书刊，小人书和年画最畅销。爱好书画的人们在著名的荣宝斋欣赏了新陈列的历代画家作品和清代“墨宝”。中国历史博物馆、鲁迅博物馆、宣武区文化馆举办的“中国通史”、“祖国十年成就”、“群众业余文艺创作”等街头展览牌前，聚集着密密麻麻的观众。一位厂甸的老游人在看过展览以后，留诗一首：“年年我把厂甸到，一年比起一年好，鼓足干劲再跃进，锦上添花放光芒。”
