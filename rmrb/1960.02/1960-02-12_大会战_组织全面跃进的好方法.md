    “Great Battle” – A Good Way to Organize a Comprehensive Leap Forward
    The Communist Party Committee of the First Automobile Works

    The "Great Battle," centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, is a good way for our factory to organize the current mass movement of comprehensive leap forward; it is a better leadership method for us to gradually consciously grasp and apply the laws of development of things, and to continuously push the mass movement forward wave after wave.

    The "Great Battle" means that within a certain period (usually about a week), with the spirit of continuous revolution and continuous leap forward, the work of the entire factory is comprehensively arranged and planned, using the method of focusing on key points and combining points with the whole, fully mobilizing on the basis of sufficient preparation, with everyone participating, and launching a comprehensive high tide of the mass movement in one go, so that all aspects of work can achieve a common leap forward under the leadership of the central task.

    From mid-October to the end of 1959, we organized three factory-wide "Great Battles" in succession. Each "Great Battle" ended victoriously with the early and comprehensive overfulfillment of the planned targets. The "Great Battle" made the momentum of the mass movement in our factory bigger and bigger, pushing the increase production and practice economy movement from one high tide to another new high tide. As a result of the "Great Battle," the production capacity of the entire factory increased from 100 vehicles per shift in 1958 to 150 vehicles per shift; labor productivity increased by 62.4% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, and by 75.7% compared to the same period in 1958; product quality increased month by month, and the scrap rate decreased from 0.97% in September to 0.69%, a decrease of 28.9% in December compared to September; the cost of automobiles decreased by 3.8% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, and by 7.8% compared to the same period in 1958; personal and equipment accidents were greatly reduced. The mass technological innovation and technological revolution movement was further developed, and enterprise management, the ideological awareness of workers, and the level of leadership were greatly improved.

    Mobilize All Forces, Grasp the Center, and Comprehensively Leap Forward

    The three "Great Battles" made the comprehensive leap forward an indisputable fact. We realized that to achieve a comprehensive leap forward, all forces must act in coordination, mobilize all positive factors, grasp the central task, and drive all other work. The "Great Battle" we organized, on the one hand, overfulfilled the production tasks and various economic indicators of the Jiefang brand automobile. This was the central link of the "Great Battle." On the other hand, it also completed the trial production and testing of the improved automobile; and further improved the quality of the Hongqi sedan with meticulousness. Technological innovation and technological revolution, management work, safety work, transportation work, and even welfare, health, security work, and all other work links, were all connected and driven in the "Great Battle," achieving a comprehensive leap forward.

    The "Great Battle" must be mainly focused on vigorous technological innovation and technological revolution in order to ensure that the goals of both completing production tasks and continuously developing production are achieved. The masses fully understand that to comprehensively realize the plan and strive for the upstream, it is necessary to vigorously carry out technological innovation and technological revolution, combining hard work with smart work. In this way, the "Great Battle" put forward new tasks and new requirements for technological innovation and technological revolution, greatly promoting the extensive development and continuous deepening of technological innovation and technological revolution. From the first "Great Battle" in our factory, the Party Committee called on all employees to "make suggestions, innovate every machine, and improve everything." Due to the mutual influence and mutual promotion of the comprehensive leap forward situation, the innovation upsurge quickly expanded from production workers, auxiliary workers, and technical personnel to production departments, management departments, and life welfare and health departments. According to incomplete statistics, in the past three months, employees have put forward nearly 50,000 suggestions for innovation projects, adopted more than 28,000, and implemented more than 15,000. According to statistics from eleven units, the "everyone has a suggestion" groups accounted for 52% of the total number of groups, the number of innovators accounted for 70.55%, and the "every machine has innovation" groups accounted for 51.4%; 70% of the equipment was innovated.

    Technological innovation and technological revolution have developed comprehensively from small to large, combining large and small, and promoting each other; from indigenous to foreign, combining foreign and indigenous. From operating methods to technological equipment, modifying equipment and manufacturing simple and efficient equipment; from technology to product design; from production technology to labor organization and the innovation of office work methods; from basic production to auxiliary production, a hundred flowers bloom. The communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act is greatly promoted among the workers, and a large number of new technologies and new processes are adopted to reform product design, process design, technological equipment, and improve working conditions; a few manual operations are advancing towards mechanization, and those that have already been mechanized are advancing towards higher mechanization and automation. Now, the automation of the entire group and the entire workshop production process has emerged one after another. The masses in the engine workshop and chassis workshop and other units have created several automated production lines.

    Because the "Great Battle" promoted the comprehensive leap forward in production, management work must be further reformed and improved to meet production requirements. In each "Great Battle," many units regarded management work as a part of each "Great Battle." They organized management work into several "dragons" for large-scale performances and competitions, and connected all the business work of the workshop, work department, and worker management group (according to the business systems of planning, safety, technology, etc.) from top to bottom, closely linking the upper and lower levels, better strengthening collaboration and cooperation, and cultivating and improving the business capabilities of professional personnel and worker administrators. Moreover, the good experiences and methods of each management work that appeared in the large-scale performances and competitions were concentrated and matched into sets using the methods of "collecting treasures" and "gathering all achievements," and then spread and promoted through performances and competitions, and widely used in daily management work. In this way, the wisdom and enthusiasm of the masses in managing enterprises were fully utilized, and the work style of management cadres was greatly improved, and their thinking was improved. The strengthening of the guidance of professional departments and the participation of workers in management has created a new atmosphere of both concentration and democracy in management; making the combination of business work and large-scale mass movements even better.

    In the "Great Battle," hospitals, canteens, nurseries, farms, non-staple food stores, department stores, barbershops, the work of workers' families, etc., were all involved in the upsurge of the "Great Battle," trying every means to serve the comprehensive leap forward in production, while also bringing about leaps forward in all aspects. For example, the attendance rate of the spare-time education of the Red and Expert School reached more than 85% in each "Great Battle," an average increase of 10%-20% compared to usual. The "Great Battle" enabled all forces to act in coordination and work together in the same boat. It is truly a matter of upholding the key link and taking everything else along, flying forward side by side.

    Apply the Theory of Uninterrupted Revolution and the Theory of Stages of Revolutionary Development to Production

    There is no end to the development of production, but in the process of development, it must form many stages of different sizes according to specific circumstances and specific conditions, and these stages are interconnected and promote each other. According to Chairman Mao's thinking of combining the theory of uninterrupted revolution with the theory of stages of revolutionary development, the goals of each "Great Battle" of ours combine and unify the long-term plan and the short-term plan for developing production, making each "Great Battle" a huge force to break through the old production balance and promote the continuous leap forward of production.

    Before the first battle in our factory, the production capacity was 100 vehicles per shift. The first "Great Battle" broke through this level and made the production capacity leap to 120 vehicles per shift; the second "Great Battle" broke through the level of 120 vehicles per shift and reached 140 vehicles per shift. Each time the production balance is broken through, there will be a great leap in production capacity, and at the same time, a large number of new contradictions will be exposed: the production capacity of a large part of the processes and groups has been improved, while the production capacity of a small part cannot keep up with the requirements, becoming a weak link and creating a new imbalance. It is necessary to solve this imbalance and realize a new balance on the basis of a new leap forward.

    We make full use of the "rest" time after the "Great Battle" to continue to carry out technological innovation and technological revolution activities, besiege the weak links, so that the backward parts gradually reach the advanced level and realize a new balance. Sometimes, according to needs, we also launch a "Great Battle" specifically to organize a new balance to solve the weak links. After the new balance state basically appears, we organize the "Great Battle" again according to the new plan and new goals. In this way, breaking through, balancing, then breaking through, and then balancing, constantly repeating, forms a development situation of continuous revolution and continuous leap forward, wave after wave, and wave higher than wave.

    In the past, many comrades had a problem that was not solved ideologically, that is, organizing current production requires balanced completion of the national plan; while tapping production potential requires constantly breaking through the balance in production. How to solve such a problem? Through the "Great Battle," this problem was solved. The specific goals of each "Great Battle" of ours are not only the requirements of tapping production potential and developing production, but also the requirements of completing the production plan for each period; and this goal is achieved by vigorously carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution. This combines and unifies the completion of the production plan for each period and the requirements for developing production; combines and unifies planned production and technological revolution, and reasonably solves the contradiction between tapping production potential and breaking through the balance, and organizing current production and requiring balance. In this way, each "Great Battle" has become not only a high tide of the mass movement for us to organize the comprehensive completion of the production plan, but also a comprehensive review of the production capacity that has reached a new stage of production development. Because of this, our factory can often keep the production capacity constantly ahead of the requirements of the production tasks to meet the needs of the socialist construction cause.

    Through the "Great Battle," we have more consciously grasped the objective law of the wave-like development of the mass movement. Using this law, we can organize the continuous leap forward of production and various tasks in a more planned and led manner.

    The "Great Battles" we organize are about twenty days to a month apart in the middle, and each battle lasts about a week. After each "Great Battle," we summarize the work from top to bottom, organize the masses to talk about the "Great Battle," discuss the changes, gains, and experiences in thinking, production, management, and working methods during the "Great Battle," concentrate the advanced thinking and good experiences in each battle to improve one step, and consolidate them. Doing so not only improves thinking and improves work, but also prepares spiritually and materially for the next "Great Battle."

    Strengthening Party Leadership and Adhering to Putting Politics in Command are the Fundamental Guarantees of Victory

    How to strengthen Party leadership? Judging from the practice of several "Great Battles," it is necessary to focus on grasping two tasks.

    The first is to formulate a good plan. Chairman Mao taught us that we should fight prepared battles and battles with certainty. Formulating a good plan is an important preparation for the "Great Battle" and is the foundation for the "Great Battle" to achieve a comprehensive leap forward. The plan of the entire factory is first studied by the Party Committee, and then by the leading backbone. After arranging both key and comprehensive arrangements, the "one pole to the end" method of the workers' representative conference is used to directly meet with the masses. Various departments and organizations at all levels then more specifically explain the task requirements to the masses according to the situation of their own units, so that the main situation of the country and the factory, the current work tasks, the favorable conditions and difficult conditions, and the main measures to complete the tasks are clearly understood in the minds of the masses. On this basis, plans are formulated layer by layer from the production department to the auxiliary and service departments, and all aspects of work are organized from bottom to top, and then fully mobilized to launch a comprehensive competition to realize the plan. The unified and layered plans are well done. On the one hand, in actual work, production and various tasks are organically combined, and various forces are concentrated on a central task, forming a unified action that promotes each other; on the other hand, the will and enthusiasm of the masses are mobilized, so that the masses consciously aim at their own struggle goals and act quickly with firm will.

    The second is to do a good job in propaganda and mobilization. Propaganda work is the vanguard of the "Great Battle." Before each battle, there is a full ideological mobilization work at all levels to explain the situation and tasks clearly and thoroughly. During the battle, there is timely and extensive propaganda work in various forms to announce the results, commend good people and good deeds, and encourage the masses to strive for the upstream. After the battle, the gains in the battle are summarized through symposium methods, and practical socialist education is carried out to improve thinking. Various propaganda platforms, victory reporting platforms, blackboards, and amateur propaganda teams and singing teams are very active, creating a magnificent atmosphere of the Great Leap Forward. To do a good job in propaganda work, it is not enough to rely solely on propaganda cadres, but the whole Party must grasp propaganda and everyone must engage in propaganda. In particular, administrative leaders at all levels directly use propaganda work methods to carry out their work. The factory director grasps propaganda, and the workshop director and section chief also grasp propaganda. Many administrative units organize propaganda teams to go deep into the production sites of the workshops to carry out propaganda; technical units and technical cadres, who have always been not active enough, also organize propaganda teams to self-compile, self-direct, and self-sing, participate in joint performances, or go to the production site to tell workers allegro and perform comic dialogues, praising workers for participating in design. In this way, the comprehensive and in-depth leap forward of propaganda work has boosted morale, spread experience, and powerfully promoted the Great Leap Forward in production.

    “大会战”——组织全面跃进的好方法
    中共第一汽车制造厂委员会
    以技术革新和技术革命为中心内容的“大会战”，是我厂当前组织全面大跃进的群众运动的好形式；是我们逐步自觉地掌握和运用事物发展规律，把群众运动一浪接一浪地不断向前推进的比较好的领导方法。
    “大会战”，就是在一个时期内（通常是一周左右），以不断革命、不断跃进的精神，将全厂工作通盘安排、全面规划，以点带面、点面结合，在充分准备的基础上，全面动员，人人参加，一鼓作气，展开全面的群众运动大高潮，达到各方面工作都在中心工作带动下共同大跃进。
    我们从1959年的10月中旬开始到年底，先后组织过三次全厂规模的“大会战”，每次“大会战”都以提前全面地超额完成预订目标而胜利结束。“大会战”，使我厂群众运动的声势一次比一次大，增产节约运动由一个高潮推向另一个新高潮。“大会战”的结果，全厂生产能力，从1958年班产百辆的基础上，提高到班产一百五十辆的水平；劳动生产率，第四季度比第三季度增长62．4％，比1958年同期增长75．7％；产品质量逐月上升，废品率由9月份的0．97％，逐月下降到0．69％，12月份比9月份降低了28．9％；汽车成本第四季度比第三季度降低3．8％，比1958年同期降低7．8％；人身、设备事故大大减少。群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动进一步发展，企业管理工作、职工思想觉悟、领导水平都有了很大的提高。
    把各方面力量调动起来，抓住中心全面跃进
    三次“大会战”，使全面大跃进成为无可争辩的事实。要获得全面的大跃进，我们体会到，必须各方面力量协同动作，调动一切积极因素，抓住中心工作，带动其它所有工作。我们组织的“大会战”，一方面超额完成了解放牌汽车的生产任务和各项经济指标。这是“大会战”的中心环节。另一方面，还完成了改进型汽车的试制和试验工作；精益求精地进一步提高了红旗轿车的质量。技术革新和技术革命，管理工作、安全工作、运输工作，以至于福利、卫生、保卫工作等一切工作环节，都在“大会战”中串联起来，带动起来，全面跃进。
    “大会战”必须以大闹技术革新和技术革命为主要内容，才能保证达到既完成生产任务，又不断发展生产的目的。群众完全明白：要全面地实现规划，争得上游，必须大闹技术革新和技术革命，苦干和巧干相结合。这样，“大会战”给技术革新和技术革命提出了新的任务和新的要求，大大促进技术革新和技术革命的广泛发展和不断深入。我厂“大会战”从第一次开始，党委号召全厂职工“人人提建议、台台有革新，事事有改进”。由于全面跃进形势的相互影响、相互推动，革新热潮很快由生产工人、辅助工人、技术人员，扩展到生产部门、管理部门、生活福利和卫生部门。据不完全统计，三个月来职工共提出建议革新项目近五万条，采纳二万八千多条，实现了一万五千多条。据十一个单位统计，“人人有建议”的小组，占所有小组总数的52％，革新人数占70．55％，“台台有革新”的小组占51．4％；有70％的设备有了革新。
    技术革新和技术革命由小到大，大小结合，相互促进；由土到洋，洋土结合，全面发展。由操作方法到工艺装备、改装设备和制造简易高效率设备；从工艺到产品设计；从生产技术到劳动组织和科室工作方法的革新；从基本生产到辅助生产，百花齐放。职工群众敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格大张，大量采用新技术、新工艺来改革产品设计、工艺设计、工艺装备和改善劳动条件；少数手工操作的向机械化进军，已经机械化的向更高的机械化进军和自动化进军。现在，整个小组、整个工部生产工序自动化，相继出现了。发动机车间和底盘车间等单位的群众，已创造了数条自动化生产线。
    由于“大会战”促进生产上的全面跃进，管理工作必须进一步改革和提高，以适应生产要求。在每次“大会战”中，许多单位将管理工作作为每次“大会战”的一项内容。他们将管理工作组成几条“龙”大表演、大竞赛，将车间、工部、工人管理小组的业务工作（按计划、安全、技术等业务系统）由上到下，一通到底地全部沟通串联起来，密切上下左右之间的联系，更好地加强协作配合，培养与提高专业人员和工人管理员的业务能力。并且将大表演、大竞赛中出现的每一项管理工作的好经验、好办法，用“聚宝”、“集大成”的方法，集中起来配成套，再通过表演、竞赛传播推广，纳入日常管理工作中去广泛利用。这样，充分地发挥了群众的管理企业的智慧和积极性，大大改进了管理干部的作风，提高了思想。专业部门指导和工人参加管理工作的加强，出现了管理上既有集中又有民主的新气象；使业务工作与大搞群众运动结合的更好了。
    在“大会战”中，医院、食堂、托儿所、农园、副食品商店、百货公司、理发室、职工家属工作等等，都卷入“大会战”的热潮，千方百计地为生产的全面跃进服务，同时带来了各方面的跃进。如红专学校的业余教育，在每次“大会战”中出席率都达85％以上，比平时平均增加10％—20％。“大会战”使各方面力量协同动作，和衷共济，真是纲举目张，并肩飞跃。
    把不断革命论与革命发展阶段论运用到生产中来
    生产的发展是没有止境的，但它在发展的过程中，又必然依据具体情况、具体条件，形成大小不同的许多阶段，这些阶段又是相互联系、相互推动的。根据毛主席的不断革命论与革命发展阶段论相结合的思想，我们每次“大会战”的目标，将发展生产的长期计划与短期计划结合起来、统一起来，使每次“大会战”成为突破旧的生产平衡，推动生产不断飞跃的巨大力量。
    我们厂在第一次会战之前，生产能力是班产一百辆，第一次“大会战”突破了这个水平，使生产能力跃进到班产一百二十辆；第二次“大会战”，又突破了班产一百二十辆的水平，达到了班产一百四十辆。每次生产平衡被突破，都出现一个生产能力大飞跃，同时暴露了大量新的矛盾：一大部分工序、小组……生产能力提高了，而一小部分生产能力跟不上要求，成为薄弱环节，产生新的不平衡局面。必须解决这种不平衡状态，在新的跃进基础上实现新的平衡。
    我们充分利用“大会战”以后的“休整”时间，继续开展技术革新和技术革命活动，围攻薄弱环节，使落后部分逐渐达到先进的水平，实现新的平衡。有时还根据需要，专门发动一次为组织新的平衡的“大会战”，来解决薄弱环节。在新的平衡状态基本出现以后，我们再根据新的计划、新的目标，组织“大会战”。如此突破、平衡，再突破、再平衡，不断反复，形成了一浪接一浪，一浪又高于一浪的不断革命、不断跃进的发展形势。
    过去，许多同志的思想上有一个问题没有解决，这就是：组织现生产，要求均衡地完成国家计划；而挖掘生产潜力，又要求不断冲破生产上的平衡状态。如何解决这样一个问题呢？通过“大会战”，这个问题解决了。我们每次“大会战”的具体目标，不但是挖掘生产潜力、发展生产的要求，而且是完成每个时期的生产计划的要求；并且用大搞技术革新和技术革命的方法，来完成这个目标。这就将完成每个时期生产计划和发展生产要求结合起来，统一起来；把计划生产与技术革命结合起来，统一起来，合理地解决了挖掘生产潜力要突破平衡，组织现生产又要求平衡之间的矛盾。这样，每次“大会战”，既成为我们组织全面完成生产计划的群众运动大高潮，又成为生产发展到一个新阶段的生产能力的全面大检阅。由于这样，使我厂有可能经常地保持生产能力不断走在生产任务要求的前面，以适应社会主义建设事业的需要。
    通过“大会战”，使我们更加自觉地掌握了群众运动波浪式发展的客观规律。运用这个规律，更有计划、有领导地来组织生产和各项工作的不断跃进。
    我们组织的“大会战”，每次中间相距大约二十天至一个月，每次会战时间一周左右。每次“大会战”之后，从上到下地总结工作，组织群众漫谈“大会战”，讨论“大会战”期间思想、生产、管理、工作方法等方面的变化、收获和经验，将每次会战中的先进思想、好的经验集中起来提高一步，并巩固下来。这样做，既提高了思想、提高了工作，又为下一次“大会战”作了精神上、物质上的准备。
    加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，是胜利的根本保证
    怎样加强党的领导？从几次“大会战”的实践来看，必须着重抓好两项工作。
    第一是订好规划。毛主席教导我们，要打有准备的仗、有把握的仗。订好规划是“大会战”的重要准备工作，是“大会战”能够获得全面跃进的基础。全厂的规划，首先在党委、然后经过领导骨干研究，既有重点又有全面地安排以后，运用职工代表大会“一竿到底”的方法，直接和群众见面。各个部门、各级组织又根据本单位情况，将任务要求更具体地向群众交底，使全国的、全厂的主要形势、当前的工作任务、有利条件和困难条件、完成任务的主要措施，在群众思想上弄的清清楚楚。在这个基础上，从生产部门到辅助、服务部门，层层订出规划，将各方面工作自下而上地组织起来，然后全面动员，展开实现规划的全面大竞赛。统一的和层层的规划做好了，一方面在实际工作中，将生产和各项工作有机地结合起来，将各方面力量集中到一个中心任务上，组成相互促进的统一的行动；另一方面又把群众的意志和积极性动员起来，使群众自觉地瞄准了自己的奋斗目标，意志坚定地快速行动。
    第二是做好宣传鼓动工作。宣传工作是“大会战”的尖兵。每次会战之前，层层都有充分的思想发动工作，把形势与任务讲清、讲透。会战期间有及时、广泛地多种多样的鼓动工作，公布战果，表扬好人好事，激励群众争上游。会战之后，又通过座谈方法，总结会战中的收获，进行实际的社会主义教育，提高思想。各种宣传台、报捷台、黑板报、业余宣传队、演唱队都十分活跃，造成一个声势雄伟的大跃进气氛。宣传工作要做好，不能仅仅依靠宣传干部，而要全党抓宣传，人人搞宣传。特别是各级行政领导干部，都直接运用宣传工作方法去开展工作，厂长抓宣传、车间主任、处长也抓宣传。许多行政单位组织宣传队，深入车间的生产现场去作宣传；一向不够活跃的技术单位、技术干部，也组织宣传队自编、自演、自唱，参加会演，或到生产现场去给工人说快板、演相声，歌颂工人参加设计。这样，全面深入的宣传工作的大跃进，鼓舞了士气，传播了经验，有力地促进了生产的大跃进。
