　　Planting High-Yield Crops According to Local Conditions
　　Beijing Suburbs Launch Mass Movement for High-Yield Bumper Harvests
　　(Our report) Beijing suburban people's communes are now actively taking measures to prepare for the large-scale planting of high-yield crops such as corn, polyspiked sorghum, sweet potatoes, and rice according to local conditions. This is an important measure to increase grain production in the context of continuous urban construction expansion, rapid development of non-staple food production, and a relative reduction in the area of cultivated land in the suburbs.
　　The Beijing suburbs have plains, hills, and mountains, as well as low-lying, sandy, and alkaline land. In the past, many kinds of grain crops were planted, but the yield increase varied. Corn, which has the largest planting area, yields more than 20% higher than the average grain field yield. In areas where corn and sweet potatoes are intercropped or rotated with wheat, the yield is even higher. Rice grown in low-lying areas yields more than 50% higher than the average grain field yield. Last year, some communes that suffered the most severe floods still had a good rice harvest. The newly planted polyspiked sorghum has high yields, wide uses, and is suitable for planting in various areas. Within two years, it has expanded to 140,000 mu, becoming one of the main high-yield crops in the suburbs.
　　Planting these high-yield crops not only produces more grain, but also provides many raw materials for industry. The city uses no less than 150 kinds of industrial raw materials made from corn by-products such as furfural and starch. Every 100 jin of polyspiked sorghum stalks and leaves can also make more than 10 jin of sugar syrup, 7 to 10 jin of wine, and the residue can be used for papermaking. The by-products of other high-yield crops also have great economic value for the chemical, fiber, papermaking, and food industries. In addition, the by-products of these crops are also important feed for developing pig raising and other animal husbandry production.
　　The city's representative meeting of advanced units and activists in agricultural socialist construction in 1959, which was held not long ago, seriously summarized the experience in this regard, and believed that planting high-yield crops according to local conditions is an important way to increase grain production under the current conditions. The relevant people's communes also believe that doing so is of great benefit to actively supporting urban construction and developing the commune economy. Under the leadership of the county (district) party committees, the communes have now formulated plans to use 60% of the grain field area this year to plant high-yield crops suitable for them, and to designate 60% of this area as high-yield fields, bumper harvest fields, and experimental fields, and to carry out large-scale 10,000-mu and 1,000-mu bumper harvest zones to facilitate mechanical operations, save labor, and ensure a bumper harvest.
　　At present, in addition to continuing to vigorously grasp the non-staple food production movement centered on pig raising and vegetable growing, Beijing's suburban people's communes are launching a mass movement focused on grain as the key link to plant high-yield crops. In order to strengthen leadership over the planting of high-yield crops, the leaders of each people's commune have divided up professional leadership fronts and started to establish professional teams. More than 200 leading cadres from communes and production teams who concentrated on studying agricultural technology have immediately returned to their posts after graduation to strengthen the technical leadership for planting high-yield crops. After the completion of the twenty-six large and medium-sized reservoir and river channel step development projects and drainage and land leveling projects that are underway, the irrigation and drainage needs of high-yield crops in the plains can basically be guaranteed. An army of 200,000 people is also preparing 10,000 jin of high-quality fertilizer per mu. The production materials management departments are also vigorously organizing sources of goods, actively transferring chemical fertilizers and irrigation and drainage machinery to support farming.

### 因地制宜大种高产作物  北京郊区开展高额丰产群众运动

    因地制宜大种高产作物
    北京郊区开展高额丰产群众运动
    本报讯　北京郊区人民公社现在积极采取措施，准备因地制宜大种玉米、多穗高粮、甘薯、水稻等高产作物。这是在城市建设不断扩大、副食品生产迅速发展和郊区耕地面积相对有所减少的形势下提出增产粮食的一项重要措施。
    北京郊区有平原、丘陵、山地，也有低洼、砂、碱地。过去种植粮食作物的种类很多，增产效果却各有不同。种植面积最广的玉米，产量比一般粮田平均产量高20％以上，玉米、甘薯间作或与小麦连作的地区，产量更高。低洼地区种植的水稻，亩产超过粮田平均产量五成以上，去年有些遭涝灾最重的公社，水稻仍然丰收。新种植的多穗高粮，产量高、用途广、适合各种地区种植，两年内已扩大到十四万亩，成为郊区的主要高产作物之一。
    种植这些高产作物，不仅多产粮食，还可以为工业提供很多原料。全市利用玉米主副产品制成的糠醛、淀粉等工业原料不下一百五十种；多穗高粮的茎、叶，每百斤也能制糖稀十多斤，出酒七至十斤，残渣还可造纸。其它几种高产作物的副产品对于化工、纤维、造纸、食品工业也都有极大的经济价值。此外，这些作物的副产品，还是发展养猪和其它畜牧生产的重要饲料。
    不久前召开的全市1959年度农业社会主义建设先进单位和积极分子代表会议，认真总结了这方面的经验，认为因地制宜地大种高产作物是在目前条件下增产粮食的重要途径；各有关人民公社也认为这样做，对积极支援城市建设和发展公社经济，都有很大好处。各公社在县（区）党委的领导下，现已定出计划，今年要用60％的粮田面积，来种植他们适宜种植的高产作物，并且要从中划出60％作为高产田、丰产田、试验田，大搞万亩、千亩丰产方，以便进行机械操作，节省劳力，保证丰收。
    目前北京郊区人民公社，除了继续大抓以养猪种菜为中心的副食品生产运动外，在围绕着以粮为纲开展种植高产作物的群众运动。各人民公社的领导上为了加强对种植高产作物的领导，已划分出专业领导战线，着手建立专业队伍；集中学习农业技术的二百多名公社和生产队的领导干部，在结业以后，已立即回到工作岗位加强对种植高产作物的技术领导。正在紧张进行中的二十六处大、中型水库、河道阶梯开发工程和排涝、平整土地工程完工后，基本上可以保证平原地区高产作物灌溉、排涝的需要。二十万积肥大军也正在为每亩地准备万斤优质肥料。生产资料经营部门也在大力组织货源，积极调运化肥、排灌机械，支援备耕。
