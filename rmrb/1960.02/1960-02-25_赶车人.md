    The whip cracks and the horse's hooves sound,
    The horse's hooves accompany the cart driver's song,
    Singing of the heroic sons and daughters fighting Taihang,
    Singing of a dawn crossing of the Songhua River.
    The sound of hooves stirs memories,
    The cart driver once guarded the frontier,
    Holding lightning as a whip,
    Shooting wolves in deep valleys and steep mountains.
    The motherland's rivers and mountains stretch for thousands of miles,
    He measures them leisurely with a gun on his shoulder,
    Loving both the beautiful scenery of Jiangnan,
    And cherishing the deep friendship of the Li ethnic group's mothers.
    Now the old soldier has returned to his hometown after demobilization,
    Replacing the gun in his hand with a long whip,
    On the land where he drove away the demons,
    He drives carts of happiness into the village.

    赶车人
    江汉帆
    鞭梢一甩马蹄响，
    马蹄伴着赶车人唱，
    歌一曲英雄儿女战太行，
    唱一个黎明抢渡松花江。
    马蹄声声催人想，
    赶车人当年守卫在边疆，
    握着闪电作马鞭，
    深谷峻岭射豺狼。
    祖国江山千万里，
    他肩着枪杆信步量，
    既爱江南山水秀，
    又惦黎家大妈情谊长。
    如今老兵复员回故乡，
    长鞭一杆换下手中枪，
    在他驱走了恶魔的土地上，
    把车车幸福赶进庄。
