Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, February 28th. All employees of Baotou Steel enthusiastically responded to the initiative from Shijingshan Steel Company, which called on steel enterprises nationwide to ensure the early completion of the first quarter's plan. They are determined to seize the current favorable time and make full use of the current advantageous conditions, acting on the spirit of "sooner rather than later," to ensure the early completion of the first quarter's steel production plan and to prepare for the second quarter's production.

The employees fighting on Baotou Steel's No. 1 automated large blast furnace, on the same day they heard the initiative from Shijingshan Steel employees, put forward the slogan of "Learn from Wuhan Steel, Catch up with Wuhan Steel, Surpass Anshan Steel, Surpass Shijingshan Steel." They are determined to adopt measures to increase blast temperature and air volume, so that the utilization coefficient will reach two in March, and the output will increase by 30% compared with February.

In today's challenge to Shijingshan Steel employees, Baotou Steel employees also put forward the fighting goal of small blast furnaces to "Learn from Anhui, Catch up with Anhui, Surpass Anhui," ensuring that the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces reaches two, and completing the first quarter's small blast furnace pig iron production plan nine days ahead of schedule.

In terms of electric furnace production, Baotou Steel employees are determined to "Learn from Dalian, Catch up with Dalian, Surpass Shanghai," so that the utilization coefficient of electric furnaces will increase by 40% in March. Open hearth furnace and converter employees also put forward specific fighting goals.

Currently, Baotou Steel employees are fighting heroically, vowing to win a complete victory in the first quarter.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 28th. Employees of Daye Steel Plant are determined to win a complete victory in the first quarter's steel production, and use this to respond to the competition initiative issued by Shijingshan Steel Company to complete the first quarter's plan ahead of schedule. Their guarantee is: to complete the first quarter's production plan for steel and steel products three to ten days ahead of schedule, to complete the iron production plan fifteen days ahead of schedule, and the quality must exceed national standards; also, to add dozens of new products in the first quarter, ensuring high yield, high quality, and multiple varieties. At the same time, we must actively prepare for the second quarter's production of steel, steel products, and iron, so as to ensure monthly red, quarterly red, and red to the end.

In order to achieve this new fighting goal, Daye Steel Plant decided to take the following measures: First, to launch a new upsurge in studying Mao Zedong Thought, and take Mao Zedong Thought as the driving force for progress; second, to continue to vigorously promote and develop the experience of tackling key problems, to establish lofty ambitions, make great efforts in technical innovation and technical revolution, march towards mechanization and automation, and ensure that work spans shifts, today spans tomorrow, the first ten days of the month spans the last ten days, and the first quarter spans the next quarter; third, to carry out cultural revolution, and vigorously run spare-time political, cultural, and technical schools and red and expert universities; fourth, to earnestly implement the policy of grasping production with one hand and grasping life with the other, and improve the lives of employees.

Since entering the new year, Daye Steel Plant employees have been full of energy. On the basis of completing the January production plan ahead of schedule, they completed the February steel production plan ahead of schedule by two days.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Dalian-Luda, February 28th. Dalian Steel Plant has been focusing on strengthening weak links in production, carrying out large-scale technical transformations, and production continued to leap forward in February. The plant's steel and steel products have already completed the monthly plan ahead of schedule by two and five days respectively; the qualification rates of steel and steel products have also exceeded the planned targets.

Since the beginning of this year, workers in various workshops of Dalian Steel Plant have further developed the communist style of cooperation, making "taking over difficulties from the previous shift, passing on experience to the next shift, giving convenience to others, and leaving difficulties to themselves." This has continuously improved the level of production. In February, in just twenty-four days, two hundred and ninety-four new production records appeared. The plant's Party committee also firmly grasped the weak links in the plant's transportation and the production of various workshops, and mobilized the masses to make great efforts in technical innovation and technical revolution. Since February, the plant's employees have already implemented more than 1,700 innovation proposals, of which more than 156 are major projects. The plant's forging steel workshop, where manual operations were the most burdensome, used just over a month to realize the annual technical transformation plan, making the forging steel operation fully mechanized and semi-mechanized, increasing labor productivity by more than 40%.
