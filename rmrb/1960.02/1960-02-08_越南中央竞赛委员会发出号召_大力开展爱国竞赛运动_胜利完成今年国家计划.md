    新华社河内6日电　据报纸报道，越南中央竞赛委员会向各地发出通知，号召大力开展爱国竞赛运动，胜利完成1960年的国家计划。
    通知指出，1960年是具有许多重要政治意义事件的一年，同时又是三年计划结束的一年，也是完成北方社会主义改造事业和准备跨进第一个五年计划的一年。通知说，这是全党全民提高爱国精神和社会主义精神的良好机会。
    通知号召各部门和各地开展一个为“争取成为先进生产者和先进生产小组”的运动；要求各地做好政治思想工作，开展技术革新，发动创造运动，促进各单位之间的竞赛。
    目前，劳动竞赛热潮正在越南各地各部门继续高涨。著名的锦普煤矿向各兄弟矿提出了超额完成生产计划的竞赛倡议，得到鸿基等煤矿的热烈响应。
    锦普煤矿开展的“学先进、赶先进、超先进”的增产竞赛，不断树立新的成绩。这个矿的“胜利”矿场职工在“装满车，出净煤”的口号下，创造了高产纪录。第二煤层的生产组每班每天的采煤量由三十二车提高到八十三车。工人们在竞赛中发挥了互助协作的精神，各组互相配合，保证共同完成任务。

    天兰锡矿今年1月份的工作量比去年同期增加一倍。年初以来，阴雨连绵，气候寒冷，给生产带来很大困难。但全体职工斗志昂扬，不向困难低头，在他们的英勇奋斗下，终于胜利地提前完成了1月份计划。
