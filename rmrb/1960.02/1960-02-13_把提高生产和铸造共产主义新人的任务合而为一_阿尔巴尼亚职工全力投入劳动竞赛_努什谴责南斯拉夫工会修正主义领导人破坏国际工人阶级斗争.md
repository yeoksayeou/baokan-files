Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 11th. A celebration meeting for the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Albanian Trade Unions was held in Tirana on the evening of the 10th.

When Nush, chairman of the Central Council of Albanian Trade Unions, delivered a report at the meeting, he pointed out that since the establishment of the Albanian Trade Unions fifteen years ago, they have continued to grow and develop under the leadership and comprehensive assistance of the Party. The union now has 137,500 members, double the number in 1955.

Nush said that it is a matter of pride that in the fifteen years of free life of our people, the trade union has made its own valuable contributions. More and more people are participating in the socialist labor competition. He pointed out that in 1949, 2,000 shock workers emerged nationwide, in 1955 there were 35,000 Stakhanovite workers, and now the broad masses of workers are fighting for the glorious title of "Socialist Labor Team."

Nush said that illiteracy among workers has long been eliminated. 42.5% of workers have undergone specialized training.

Nush said that before liberation, Albania was the only country in Europe without a social insurance system, and in 1958 the state's appropriations for workers' insurance and welfare undertakings increased by nearly eight times compared with 1946.

Nush emphasized that the Albanian Trade Union is unswervingly advancing on the road of Marxism-Leninism. He pointed out that the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions faithfully serves the imperialist war provocateurs. The Yugoslav Trade Union Confederation is also engaged in divisive activities. He said that the Yugoslav trade union revisionist leaders headed by Vukmanović are loyal running dogs of U.S. imperialism. They are trying by all means to undermine the struggle of the international working class, especially attempting to split the workers' movement in some countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

Nush finally said that the Albanian Trade Union, together with all members of the World Federation of Trade Unions, will continue to fight against splitters in the international workers' class ranks, strengthen the unity of the laborers, and strengthen the iron-like unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

Albanian leaders Hoxha, Shehu and others attended the celebration meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana. The representative meeting of participants in the Albanian "Fifteenth Anniversary of Liberation Production Team" was held in Tirana on February 1st. This meeting was jointly organized by the Central Council of the Albanian Trade Unions and the Central Committee of the Labor Youth League.

Nush, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and chairman of the Central Council, made a report at the meeting. He said that by the end of 1959, there were already 856 production teams (composed of more than 9,500 people) across Albania who had joined the socialist labor competition for the title of "Fifteenth Anniversary of Liberation Production Team." In the industrial sector alone, they increased the value of products for the country by 124.4 million leks (Albanian currency). He said that the movement of "Socialist Labor Production Team" will be carried out in 1960. The participants of the "Socialist Labor Production Team" will be mostly young people, and the content and goals will also be different from previous movements. The main principle of this movement is: to treat work, study, and life with a socialist attitude, which is to combine the tasks of increasing production and forging new communist people into one. He called on the production teams in industry to take the lead in improving product quality and continuously reducing costs, and the production teams in agriculture to first realize the slogan of the "Three Hundred Workdays Movement" put forward by the Party.

Nush said that the vigorous socialist competition that has sprung up from all corners of the country and the achievements at the beginning of this year show that a good start has already been made. The Albanian working class has truly understood the importance of the Party's resolution and has fully devoted itself to the labor competition, striving to fulfill the tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

The delegates discussed the report.

Koleka, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, also spoke at the meeting. He called on the participants to further expand the competition movement and strive to complete the tasks determined by the December Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee.

Piristeri, Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the Albanian People's Assembly, presented the advanced labor producers with awards and medals at the meeting.

The meeting also unanimously adopted a congratulatory telegram to the Central Committee of the Labor Party and a letter of appeal to the participants of the "Socialist Labor Production Team" competition movement and laborers nationwide.

    把提高生产和铸造共产主义新人的任务合而为一
    阿尔巴尼亚职工全力投入劳动竞赛
    努什谴责南斯拉夫工会修正主义领导人破坏国际工人阶级斗争
    新华社地拉那11日电　10日晚地拉那举行了阿尔巴尼亚工会成立十五周年庆祝大会。
    阿尔巴尼亚工会中央理事会主席努什在会上作报告时指出，阿尔巴尼亚工会成立十五年以来，在党的领导和全面帮助下，不断地成长和壮大。现在工会拥有十三万七千五百名会员，比1955年增加了一倍。
    努什说，值得引为自豪的是，在我国人民自由生活的十五年中，工会作出了自己宝贵的贡献。参加社会主义劳动竞赛的人愈来愈多。他指出，1949年全国出现了二千名突击手，1955年有三万五千名斯塔哈诺夫式工作者，现在广大职工正在为争取“社会主义劳动队”的光荣称号而斗争。
    努什说，职工中的文盲早已消灭。有42．5％的工人经过了专业化的训练。
    努什说，阿尔巴尼亚解放前是欧洲唯一没有社会保险制度的国家，而1958年国家用于职工保险和福利事业的拨款比1946年增加了近八倍。
    努什强调说，阿尔巴尼亚工会坚定不移地在马克思列宁主义的道路上前进。他指出，国际自由工会联合会忠顺地为帝国主义战争挑拨者服务。南斯拉夫工会联合会也同样进行分裂活动。他说，以伏克曼诺维奇为首的南斯拉夫工会修正主义领导人是美帝国主义的忠实走卒。他们不择手段地力图破坏国际工人阶级的斗争，特别是企图分裂亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲某些国家的工人运动。
    努什最后说，阿尔巴尼亚工会同世界工会联合会的所有成员一道，将继续为反对国际工人阶级队伍中的分裂分子、加强劳工的团结和加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营钢铁般的团结而斗争。
    阿尔巴尼亚领导人霍查、谢胡等参加了庆祝大会。
    新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚“解放十五周年生产队”参加者代表会议，2月1日在地拉那举行。这次会议是由阿尔巴尼亚工会中央理事会和劳动青年联盟中央委员会联合组织的。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、工会中央理事会主席努什在会上作报告时说，到1959年底，阿尔巴尼亚全国已经有八百五十六个生产队（由九千五百多人组成）投入了争取“解放十五周年生产队”称号的社会主义劳动竞赛。单在工业部门中，他们就为国家增产了价值一亿二千四百万里克（阿币）的产品。他说，1960年将要开展“社会主义劳动生产队”的运动。“社会主义劳动生产队”参加者绝大多数将是青年，而且内容和目标也不同于历次的运动，这个运动的主要原则是：以社会主义的态度对待工作、学习和生活，这就是把提高生产和铸造共产主义新人的任务合而为一。他号召工业中的生产队要切实带头做到提高产品质量和不断降低成本，农业中的生产队要首先实现党所提出的“三百个劳动日运动”的口号。
    努什说，全国四面八方所掀起的蓬勃的社会主义竞赛和今年年初的成绩表明：已经有了一个顺利的开始，阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级已经切实地了解到党的决议的重要性，并且全力投入了劳动竞赛，争取提前实现第二个五年计划的任务。
    大会就这个报告进行了讨论。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席科列加也在会上讲了话。他号召会议参加者进一步扩大竞赛运动，为完成党中央十二月全会所确定的任务而努力。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团副主席皮里斯特里在会上授予了先进劳动生产者奖旗和奖章。
    会议还一致通过了给劳动党中央的致敬电和一封给“社会主义劳动生产队”竞赛运动参加者以及全国劳动者的号召书。
