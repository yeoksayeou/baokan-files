Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 10th: Wang Chonglun, a nationally renowned innovation expert and deputy director of the Tool Workshop of the Northern Machinery Repair Factory of Anshan Iron and Steel, has carried forward the spirit of continuous revolution and has innovated 45 tools and equipment items since New Year's Day.

After attending the National Congress of Heroes and returning to the workshop, Wang Chonglun actively plunged into the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, determined to improve the processing capacity of machine tools, produce more spare parts, and ensure that the production needs of various factories and mines are met. Wang Chonglun, while frequently participating in labor, discovered that lathe operator Hu Dalao was drilling small holes in the mine's sieve plates, with each plate requiring over 12,000 holes, meaning that it would take more than seventy sieve plates to work for five years. Aiming at this key issue, Wang Chonglun worked with everyone to research and create a "double-drill semi-automatic lathe" that placed seven sieve plates together, increasing work efficiency by fourteen times. He also learned from the experience of the Fengcheng County Machinery Factory, improving the multi-jaw live tool tire and implementing powerful cutting, increasing efficiency by more than forty times when processing the small pressure machine's "Shao Tie." He then improved the "multi-live card tire" and other tools, which played an important role in improving processing efficiency.

Wang Chonglun's spirit of continuous revolution has inspired the workers to make great efforts in technical innovation and technical revolution. The tool workshop where he works completed one hundred and twenty major innovation projects in January, overfulfilling the monthly plan six and a half days ahead of schedule. After entering February, production has reached a new peak: completing two days of workload every day.

    老模范不断革命
    王崇伦革新四十五种机具
    据新华社鞍山10日电　全国著名革新能手、鞍钢北部机修厂工具车间副主任王崇伦，发扬不断革命的精神，从元旦到现在又革新工具、设备四十五项。
    王崇伦在出席了全国群英会回到车间之后，就积极投入了技术革新与技术革命运动，决心提高机床加工能力，多产备件，保证适应各厂矿的生产需要。王崇伦在经常参加劳动中，发现车工胡达老给矿山钻筛子板小孔，每块钻一万二千多个孔，七十多块筛子板得干五年才能完成。针对这一关键，王崇伦同大家共同研究，创造一种“双钻半自动车”，把七块筛子板落在一块，提高工作效率十四倍。他还学习凤城县机械厂的经验，改进了多卡活工具胎，实行强力切削，在加工小压力机“捎铁”时，提高效率四十多倍。接着又改进了“多活卡胎”等，对提高加工效率起了重要作用。
    王崇伦的不断革命的精神，激发了工人大闹技术革新和技术革命的热情。他所在的工具车间，1月份实现了一百二十件较大革新项目，提前六天半全面超额地完成了月计划；进入2月之后，生产又登上了新的高峰：每天都完成两天的工作量。
