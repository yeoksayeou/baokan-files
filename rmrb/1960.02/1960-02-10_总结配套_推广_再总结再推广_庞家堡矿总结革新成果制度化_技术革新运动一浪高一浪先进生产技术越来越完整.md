    Pangjiabao Mine Systematizes Innovation Achievements
    Technical Innovation Movement Surges Higher and Higher, Advanced Production Technology Becomes More Complete
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Xuanhua, February 9th) The Pangjiabao Iron Mine of Hebei Province's Longyan Iron and Steel Company, in the technical innovation movement, frequently transforms the piecemeal innovation achievements of the masses into complete sets of experiences, persists in them, develops and supplements them in the practice of the masses, and then summarizes and promotes them again; and lists this method as a regular system of enterprise management. Therefore, the technical innovation movement in the entire mine develops continuously in ever-higher waves, and advanced production technology becomes richer and more complete with each iteration.
    The work of systematic summarization and complete promotion of innovation achievements at the Pangjiabao Iron Mine is carried out under the unified leadership of the Party committee, organizing the joint efforts of all aspects. Each production team and group regularly organizes technical performance competitions and innovation contests; throughout the mine, under the leadership of the Party committee secretary, leading cadres from various functional departments, advanced producers, and veteran workers are absorbed to form a Technical Revolution Committee, which sets up ten advanced experience integration groups, such as mining, transportation, and geological surveying. Based on the key to production in each period, from the group to the work area, then to the pit and the entire mine, a method of class-by-class comparison, layer-by-layer selection, and level-by-level evaluation is carried out regularly, selecting the best experiences in each process and type of work, matching them into complete sets, and promoting them comprehensively. In the practice of the masses, some links move forward and new imbalances appear, so technical performances are organized again, summarized, integrated and promoted, and this cycle continues endlessly.
    The Pangjiabao Mine's systematization of the methods of summarizing and promoting technical innovation achievements has played an important role in the long-term sustained development of the technical innovation movement. Since December of last year, the mine has conducted three rounds of summarizing and promoting technical innovation achievements, each time pushing the technical innovation movement to a climax and solving key production problems each time. The excessively long caving time of each mining face has been an old problem that the mine has not been able to solve for many years. In early January, the mine's leaders organized three technical performance competitions for the mine's nine caving teams. In just over ten days, they summarized a set of multi-rope and large-rope quick caving methods, shortening the caving time of the entire mine from the usual sixteen hours or so to seven to four hours, increasing the average mining intensity of the mining team by 5.5%, and also increasing the timber recovery rate from 41.3% in the past to 80% to 90%. From December of last year to the present, the mine has summarized and promoted sixty-three sets of advanced operating methods and two hundred and seventy-seven innovative machines and tools. The average mining intensity of the entire mine has been greatly improved. Manual pushing of carts has been eliminated in the roadway transportation more than two hundred meters underground, and mechanized transportation has been achieved, increasing transportation efficiency by more than two times. At present, the mine is organizing a new upsurge of technical innovation focusing on achieving high-intensity mining and the automation of pneumatic, water, and electromechanical equipment. The Red Star Mining Team of the Third Pit integrated the experience of the past four technical performance competitions and created a single-face high-intensity mining method, achieving high-intensity mining targets. Fifty-six water pumps, air compressors, exhaust fans, etc. in the entire mine have achieved automation.

    总结配套——推广——再总结再推广
    庞家堡矿总结革新成果制度化
    技术革新运动一浪高一浪先进生产技术越来越完整
    本报宣化9日电　河北省龙烟钢铁公司庞家堡铁矿在技术革新运动中，经常把系统总结群众的点滴革新成果变为成套经验，再坚持下去，在群众的实践中发展补充，然后又总结推广；并把这种方法列为企业管理工作的一项经常制度。因此，全矿技术革新运动一浪高一浪的持续发展，先进生产技术一次比一次丰富完整。
    庞家堡铁矿系统总结和成套推广革新成果的工作，是在党委统一领导下组织各方面力量共同进行的。各个生产队、组，都定期地组织技术表演赛，进行革新比武；在全矿范围内，由党委书记挂帅，吸收各职能科室的领导干部、先进生产者、老工人参加，组成技术革命委员会，下设采矿、运输、地质勘测等十个先进经验配套小组，根据每个时期的生产关键，从小组到工区，再到坑、全矿，定期地进行类类比、层层选、逐级评的办法，将各个工序、工种中的最好的经验选出来，搭配成套，全面推广。在群众的实践中，有些环节向前发展了，出现了新的不平衡，再组织技术表演，总结配套推广，如此循环不已。
    庞家堡矿把总结和成套推广技术革新成果的方法制度化，对技术革新运动长期持续发展起了重要作用。这个矿从去年12月到现在，已经进行了三次总结和成套推广技术革新成果的工作，每一次都把技术革新运动推向高潮，每一次都解决了生产关键问题。各个采矿面放顶时间过长，是这个矿多少年来都没有解决的老问题。1月初，这个矿的领导人员组织全矿九个放顶队进行了三次技术表演赛，前后只用十多天时间，总结出了一套多绳套、大绳套快速放顶法，全矿放顶时间由一般十六个小时左右缩短到七小时至四小时，使采矿队的平均采矿强度提高了5．5％，坑木回收率也由过去的41．3％提高到80％到90％。从去年12月到现在，这个矿已经总结推广了六十三套先进操作方法和二百七十七件革新机具，全矿平均采矿强度大大提高，坑下二百米以上的巷道运输消灭了人力推车，实现了运输机械化，运输效率提高了两倍多。目前，这个矿正围绕着实现高强度采矿和风动、水、机电等设备自动化，组织新的技术革新高潮。三坑红星采矿队工人综合了过去四次技术表演赛的经验，创造出单掌子面高强度采矿法，实现了高强度采矿指标。全矿已有五十六台水泵、压风机、抽风机等实现了自动化。
