Combining Crash Purchases with Regular Purchases

The overall situation on the commercial purchasing front is very good. The purchasing of major agricultural and sideline products has been successfully completed according to plan in most parts of the country. Some areas are actively carrying out the final stages of purchasing. Significant achievements have also been made in the purchasing of wild plants and waste products. However, this does not mean that the purchasing work is over, nor does it mean that no further efforts are needed. On the contrary, the purchasing of many products needs to be continued, and we should combine crash purchases with regular purchases to continue our efforts to do a better job in purchasing work.

A new problem is before us. Due to the widespread development of the mass technological innovation and technological revolution movement, labor productivity has rapidly increased, which inevitably demands more and greater supplies of raw materials. How to adapt to this new situation, and on the basis of the great achievements already made in purchasing work, continue to exert great effort to provide more raw materials, especially agricultural and sideline product raw materials, and meet the needs of industrial production departments for raw materials as much and as timely as possible, has become a very urgent and important task for Party committees and people's committees at all levels in rural areas, as well as for commercial departments.

To fully and promptly purchase the raw materials and other agricultural and sideline products of the vast rural areas, it is necessary to carry out purchasing work in various forms. Crash purchases should be made for those that require crash purchases; regular purchases should be made for those that require regular purchases. Crash purchases and regular purchases should be well combined according to the different situations of different regions and different varieties. As we all know, after the autumn harvest last year, we launched a large-scale mass crash purchasing campaign in the vast rural areas and achieved great results. The facts of the past two years have fully proved that, under the circumstances that various production, construction and transportation tasks in rural areas are very heavy, and labor and transportation forces are very tight, and under the circumstances that the volume of agricultural and sideline products is becoming larger and larger, it is more necessary than ever to carry out mass crash purchasing campaigns. This mass crash purchasing campaign is a component of the socialist economic construction mass movement, and it is the application and development of the Party's mass line in purchasing work. However, emphasizing crash purchases does not mean that regular purchases can be ignored. Because in addition to the materials that are concentrated on the market in large quantities during the autumn harvest season and are suitable for crash purchases, there are also many agricultural and sideline products that are successively and dispersedly marketed in other seasons and are suitable for regular purchases. The proportion of products purchased during the peak season after autumn is certainly the largest, but generally speaking, there are agricultural and sideline products that need to be purchased in all seasons of the year, and every season must be grasped. Moreover, it should also be seen that crash purchases and regular purchases are originally interconnected and mutually transformable under certain conditions. Some products should be purchased in a crash during the peak season and should be switched to regular purchases during the off-season; some products should be purchased in a crash in concentrated producing areas and should be purchased regularly in scattered producing areas. Sometimes, from the national perspective, from the overall purchasing situation, the main focus is on regular purchases. But for a few regions and a few varieties, crash purchases should be carried out. In fact, many places have made great achievements not only in crash purchases but also in regular purchases. Therefore, we must attach importance to both crash purchases and regular purchases, and we must flexibly use various forms of purchasing in order to complete the various purchasing tasks of the state satisfactorily.

Generally speaking, the purchasing of agricultural products in the autumn of last year has been basically completed, but it is still not balanced in terms of regions and varieties. A province or a county has generally completed or nearly completed the purchasing plan. However, there are still a few counties in a province that have not completed the plan; and within the scope of a county, there are still individual communes and production teams that have not completed the plan. This means that some production teams of people's communes and some members still have a certain amount of various agricultural and sideline products that should be purchased, such as cotton, flue-cured tobacco, hemp, oilseeds, and various local sideline products that still need to be purchased. In areas that have already completed the purchasing plan, farmers still have scattered agricultural and sideline products that can be sold and need to be purchased. Although these things are scattered, they add up to a considerable amount, which is also of great significance for meeting the needs of industrial raw materials. At the same time, communes, production teams, and members also require to sell these products, increase income, and exchange for the means of production and means of livelihood they need. Therefore, in some areas, and for some varieties, the concentrated crash purchasing should continue. Of course, some places can also adopt the method of decentralized purchasing. In cotton-producing areas, it is particularly important to emphasize strengthening the later-stage purchasing of cotton. Cotton is an important raw material for the textile industry, and it is extremely closely related to the lives of the broad masses of people. Purchasing a sufficient quantity of cotton to increase the production of cotton cloth and to increase the production of various knitted goods as much as possible is of great economic significance and also of great political significance for meeting the growing needs of the people's economic life.

More importantly, after the beginning of spring, many new agricultural and sideline products are being produced successively, and the quantity is growing even more than in previous years, and the purchasing work must also be strengthened. My country is rich in agricultural resources and has a wide variety of products, and agricultural and sideline products are harvested in all seasons of the year. At present, in the tea-producing areas in the south, spring tea will be on the market in half a month, followed closely by spring cocoons, rapeseed, summer grain, and early rice, which will also be launched successively in some areas. In terms of local sideline products, it is now the production season for moso bamboo, palm chips, rosin, turpentine, grass bags, straw mats, charcoal, twigs and willows, cotton stalk skins, various woven products, medicinal materials, fire saltpeter, leather saltpeter, etc., and it is also necessary to carry out purchasing business in a timely manner. As for live pigs, animal products, eggs, and various waste products, these are things that need to be purchased regularly throughout the year. These products are usually purchased in the spring of previous years, but this year has new characteristics, that is: due to the rapid development of diversified operations of people's communes, due to the great development of rural animal husbandry, and due to the further development of wild plant collection and processing, the products that need to be purchased in the spring are larger in quantity and more in variety than in previous years. This requires better organization of forces to purchase these products in a timely manner in order to better support the high-speed development of industrial production. At present, for these products, from the perspective of the situation in most areas, it is mainly necessary to emphasize the transition to regular purchases and do a good job in the purchasing work of various seasonal agricultural and sideline products.

Whether it is crash purchasing or regular purchasing, it requires a certain amount of time, a certain amount of labor, and transportation capacity. Now the vast rural areas are about to start spring plowing, and rural labor and transportation capacity are relatively tight. Under these circumstances, Party committees at all levels, especially Party committees at the commune level, should make overall and unified arrangements for production and purchasing work, do a good job in political and ideological work and organizational work, and first ensure production and then do a good job in purchasing work. Commercial departments should do a good job in the business work related to purchasing. In particular, pay attention to summarizing the effective purchasing work experience of the past, adapt to the production and living conditions of members after the people's communes, and constantly improve the purchasing methods. The problem of purchasing methods is essentially a problem of establishing political, production, and mass viewpoints in commercial work, and it is a problem of closely combining economic work and political work. For example, in the process of purchasing, purchasing personnel should patiently publicize the Party's policies and current situation to the broad masses of members. If members do not have time to sell products during the day, purchasing personnel should organize mobile door-to-door purchasing and use the evening time to purchase; if members need various means of production and means of livelihood after selling products, commercial personnel should try their best to meet their needs; if members want to engage in sideline production, commercial departments should give them strong support in all aspects, and so on. Commercial personnel must embody political viewpoints, production viewpoints, and mass viewpoints well in their work, and improve purchasing methods. The most important thing is to adhere to putting politics in command, constantly improve their political consciousness, and establish a noble communist style. Only when commercial purchasing personnel are not afraid of difficulties, do not fear hardship, proceed from production everywhere, and think of the convenience of production and life of members everywhere to improve purchasing methods, can they win the support of members and successfully complete the purchasing task.

The purchasing work for the new year has begun, and the purchasing work will become increasingly busy with the rapid development of industry and agriculture. All comrades on the purchasing front must recognize the current excellent situation, strive for monthly red, quarterly red, annual red, and complete red in purchasing work, and supply more raw materials to industrial production departments and market needs in a steady stream, and make greater contributions to promoting the continued leap forward of the national economy this year.

### 把突击收购和经常收购结合起来

    把突击收购和经常收购结合起来
    当前商业收购战线上总的形势很好，全国大部分地区主要农副产品的收购工作都已经胜利完成计划，部分地区正在积极进行收购的扫尾工作；野生植物和废品的收购也取得了很大的成绩。但这不是说收购工作就此结束了，也不是说再不要作什么努力了。相反，许多产品的收购工作还需要继续展开，我们应当把突击收购与经常收购结合起来，继续努力把收购工作做得更好。
    一个新的问题摆在我们面前，这就是由于全民性的技术革新和技术革命运动广泛开展，劳动生产率迅速提高，因而也就必然要对原料供应提出更多更大的要求。如何适应这一新的形势，在收购工作已经取得巨大成绩的基础上，继续鼓足干劲，提供更多的原料，特别是农副产品原料，尽可能而又及时地满足工业生产部门对原料的需要，就成为农村的各级党委、人民委员会以及商业部门一项十分迫切而又重要的任务。
    要把广大农村的原料和其他农副产品都充分地、及时地收购起来，必须以多种多样的形式开展收购工作。需要突击收购的就突击收购；需要经常收购的就经常收购。应当根据不同地区、不同品种的不同情况，把突击收购和经常收购很好地结合起来。大家知道，去年秋收以后，我们在广大农村里展开了大规模的群众性的突击收购运动，获得了巨大成绩。近两年来的事实充分证明：在农村各项生产建设和运输任务都很繁重、劳动力和运输力都很紧张的情况下，在农副产品商品量越来越大的情况下，大搞群众性的突击收购运动比过去任何时期都显得更加必要。这种群众性的突击收购运动是社会主义经济建设群众运动的一个组成部分，是党的群众路线在收购工作中的运用和发展。但是，强调突击收购，并不是说就可以忽视经常收购。因为除了在秋收季节集中大量上市、适宜于突击收购的物资以外，还有在其他季节陆续分散上市、适宜于经常收购的许多农副产品。秋后旺季收购的产品，比重固然最大，但是总的说来，一年四季都有农副产品需要收购，任何一个季节都要抓紧。而且还应当看到，突击收购和经常收购两者本来就是互相联系的，是在一定条件之下互相转化的。有些产品在旺季应当突击收购，在淡季就应当转入经常收购；有些产品，在产品集中的产区应当突击收购，在产品分散的产区就应当经常收购。有些时候，从全国来说，从总的收购局势来看，主要是进行经常收购。但是从少数地区、少数品种来说，应当进行突击收购。事实上，许多地方不但在突击收购方面有了很大的成绩，而且在经常收购方面也有了很大的成绩。因此，我们既要重视突击收购，又要重视经常收购，必须灵活运用多种多样的收购形式，才能够完满地完成国家的各项收购任务。
    去年秋季农产品的收购，总的说来已经基本完成，但是在地区上、品种上还是不够平衡的。一个省、一个县总的看收购计划完成了，或者接近完成了。但在一个省内还有少数县没有完成计划；在一个县的范围内还有个别公社、生产队没有完成计划。这就是说，一些人民公社的生产队和一些社员手中还存有一定数量应该收购起来的各种农副产品如棉花、烤烟、麻、油料和各种土副产品还需要收购起来。在已经完成收购计划的地区，农民手里也还有零星的可以出售的农副产品需要收购起来，这些东西虽然是零星的，但集中起来也是一个不小的数目，对于满足工业原料的需要也有很大意义。同时，公社、生产队和社员也要求出售这些产品，增加收入，换取所需要的生产资料和生活资料。因此，在有些地区、对有些品种的集中的突击性收购，还要继续进行。当然，有些地方也可以采取分散收购的办法。在产棉区特别要强调加强对棉花的后期收购工作。棉花是重要的纺织工业原料，它和广大人民生活关系极为密切。收购足够数量的棉花以增加棉布的生产，并尽可能地增加各种针织品的生产，这对于满足人民经济生活日益增长的需要，不仅具有重大的经济意义，也具有重大的政治意义。
    更重要的是，入春以后，许多新的农副产品正在陆续生产出来，数量比往年更增长了，也必须加强收购工作。我国农业资源丰富，种类繁多，农副产品一年四季都有收获。从目前来说，在南方产茶区，再过半个月春茶就要上市，紧跟着春茧、油菜、夏粮、早稻也要在部分地区陆续登场。在土副产品方面，目前正是毛竹、棕片、松香、松节油、草袋、草席、木炭、荆柳藤条、棉秆皮、各种编织品、药材、火硝、皮硝等生产季节，也需要及时地开展收购业务。至于生猪、畜产品、蛋品、各种废品更是需要一年四季经常不断收购的东西。这些产品在往年春季是照例要进行收购的，但是今年有着新的特点，这就是：由于人民公社多种经营的迅速发展，由于农村畜牧业的大发展，由于野生植物采集和加工的进一步发展，需要在春季进行收购的产品比往年数量更大，品种更多。这就需要更好地组织力量及时地把这些产品收购起来，以更好地支持工业生产的高速发展。目前对于这些产品，从大部分地区的情况来说，主要是应当强调转入经常收购，把多种多样的当令的农副产品的收购工作做好。　　　　　　　　　　　
    不论是突击收购或经常收购，都需要一定的时间、一定的劳动力和运输力。现在广大农村即将开始春耕了，农村劳动力和运输力都是比较紧张的。在这种情况下，各级党委，特别是公社一级党委，应当把生产和收购工作进行全面统一的安排，做好政治思想工作和组织工作，既要首先保证生产，又要做好收购工作。商业部门应当做好有关收购的业务工作。特别是注意总结过去行之有效的收购工作经验，适应人民公社化以后社员生产和生活的情况，不断地改进收购方法。收购方法的问题实质上也是在商业工作中树立政治、生产和群众观点的问题，是经济工作和政治工作紧密结合的问题。例如，在收购当中，收购人员应当向广大社员耐心地宣传党的方针政策和当前形势，社员白天劳动没有时间出售产品，收购人员就应当组织流动串乡串户收购和利用晚上的时间收购；社员在出售产品以后需要各种生产、生活资料，商业人员就应当千方百计地设法满足他们的需要；社员要搞副业生产，商业部门就应当在各方面给他们以大力的支持，等等。商业人员要很好地在工作中体现政治观点、生产观点和群众观点，改进收购方法。最重要的是要坚持政治挂帅，不断地提高自己的政治觉悟，树立起高尚的共产主义风格。商业收购人员只有不怕困难，不辞辛苦，处处从生产出发，处处从社员群众生产生活方便着想，来改进收购方法，才能取得社员的拥护，也才能出色地完成收购任务。
    新的年度的收购工作又开始了，收购工作将要随着工农业的迅速发展而日益繁忙起来。所有收购战线上的同志们要认清当前的大好形势，争取收购工作的月月红、季季红、全年红、满堂红，把更多的原料源源不断地供应工业生产部门，供应市场需要，为促进今年国民经济继续跃进，做出更大的贡献来。
