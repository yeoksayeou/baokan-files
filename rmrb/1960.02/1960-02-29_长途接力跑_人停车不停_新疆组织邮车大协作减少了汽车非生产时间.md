Long-Distance Relay Run - People Stop, Cars Don't
    Xinjiang Organizes Postal Vehicle Collaboration to Reduce Non-Productive Vehicle Time
    (Our dispatch) The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Postal and Telecommunications Administration has launched a postal automobile transportation "one-dragon" collaboration, implementing a "long-distance relay, collective shifts, day and night operation, rapid transit" (referred to as postal express) method, greatly changing the face of postal transportation.
    This reform has primarily accelerated the circulation time of newspapers and magazines and mail. Previously, 72% of the counties and cities in this region could only see newspapers after three days; now, 94% of the counties and cities can see newspapers within three days. Secondly, it has greatly improved vehicle utilization. Last year, the region's trunk line transportation volume increased by 30%, while the number of vehicles decreased by 40%. However, due to the implementation of the "postal express" method, not only was the contradiction between fewer vehicles and greater volume resolved, but the entire autonomous region's trunk lines freed up thirty-two postal vehicles, opening up more than 5,000 kilometers of new postal routes. At the same time, the cost per vehicle kilometer decreased from 0.54 yuan to 0.47 yuan, and the safety rate reached over 99%.
    The specific practices of "postal express" are: on each postal transport trunk line, adopting the "four fixed" method of fixed route, fixed departure point, fixed departure time, and fixed shift, changing the old method of one person operating one vehicle, with people stopping, vehicles stopping, and mail also stopping, to a relay race method, i.e., drivers rotating in shifts, traveling day and night, changing drivers but not vehicles. For example, on the postal transport trunk line from Urumqi to Hotan County, which is more than 2,000 kilometers long, in the past one person drove one vehicle, divided into eight sections. After the first section of the postal vehicle reached its destination, the driver, postal vehicle, and mail all stopped overnight. The next day, after the mail and the postal vehicle responsible for the next section were transferred, they returned separately. In this way, newspapers, magazines, and mail from Urumqi to Hotan County took one hundred and ninety-four hours to arrive, while the actual vehicle operation time was only eighty-two hours, with the remaining time spent on rest, meals, vehicle maintenance, and mail exchange, which was non-productive time. After implementing the "postal express" method, the route from Urumqi to Hotan County was divided into two major sections, each section with six vehicles, operated by twelve drivers in relay, returning one section every six days, with one day for vehicle maintenance, and continuing the cycle on the seventh day. Vehicles in the two sections exchanged mail in the major sections and transshipped it in segments. In this way, newspapers, magazines, and mail from Urumqi to Hotan only take fifty-nine hours, of which the vehicle travel time is fifty-one hours, and the time spent exchanging mail, maintaining vehicles, and changing vehicles along the way is only eight hours. Originally, this trunk line had twenty vehicles and forty drivers; now it only has twelve vehicles and twenty-four drivers, but the mail transit time is more than three times faster. Drivers have more than twenty hours of rest after driving for eight or nine hours in the relay, which ensures that the drivers are energetic and drive safely, and also solves the problem of drivers not being able to study well for a long time.
    When carrying out "postal express," the Postal and Telecommunications Administration divided each trunk line into a "one-dragon," launching a "one-dragon" collaboration. The "dragon head" bureau, according to the publication time of newspapers and the departure time of postal vehicles, organized manpower to quickly load and seal the vehicles. The "dragon body" bureaus (offices) used telephones to forecast the postal express dynamics to the next station, station by station, bureau by bureau, to prepare for the exchange. As soon as the vehicle arrived at the station, personnel on and off the vehicle immediately exchanged and checked the items. Stationed rest personnel also added water, fuel, and repaired the vehicles, so small stations only stopped for three to five minutes, county stations only stopped for ten to fifteen minutes, and special district stations only stopped for twenty to thirty minutes to complete the exchange. In order to ensure the normal operation of the trunk lines, the "dragon body" bureaus of each trunk line also established a dispatching system that protects the trunk lines at all levels. When an accident occurred on the trunk line postal vehicle, they immediately mobilized the nearest branch line vehicles, technicians, materials, and equipment to provide support. In addition, a set of vehicle maintenance system was established. The "dragon head" bureau established a maintenance base, and maintenance teams were established at each station along the line according to the average mileage, equipped with maintenance personnel and equipment. Maintenance workers throughout the line implemented day and night shifts, and drivers launched a collective vehicle care competition, so the vehicle maintenance work was done better than when each person had one vehicle. Currently, the major overhaul interval mileage of 20% of the postal vehicles has exceeded 200,000 kilometers, and the mileage exceeding 150,000 kilometers has reached 52%.

    长途接力跑  人停车不停
    新疆组织邮车大协作减少了汽车非生产时间
    本报讯　新疆维吾尔自治区邮电管理局开展邮政汽车运输一条龙大协作，实行“长途接力、集体轮班、昼夜兼程、快速运行”（简称邮运快车）办法，大大改变了邮政运输面貌。
    这项改革首先普遍加快了报刊和邮件的运转时间。这个区原来有72％的县市要在三天以后才能看到报纸，现在有94％的县市三天以内就可以看到报纸了。其次是大大提高了车辆利用率。去年这个区干线运输量增加了30％，车辆反而减少了40％，但是由于实行“邮运快车”办法，不但解决了车辆少运量大的矛盾，全自治区干线还腾出三十二辆邮车，增辟五千多公里新邮路。同时，车公里成本从零点五四元降到零点四七元，安全率达到99％以上。
    “邮运快车”的具体做法是：在各条邮运干线上，采取定线行驶、定点发班、定时出发、定班出车的“四定”办法，把过去一人包开一辆车，人停、车停、邮件也停的老办法，改变为用接力赛跑的办法，即驾驶员循环轮班、昼夜兼程、换人不换车。如从乌鲁木齐至和田县二千多公里长的邮运干线，过去一人一车，分八段行驶。第一段邮车到达终点后，司机和邮车、邮件都停下过夜，第二天把邮件和负责下一段的邮车互相倒驳后，分别返去。这样，从乌鲁木齐到和田县的报刊、邮件就要经过一百九十四小时以后才能到达，而汽车实际运转时间只有八十二小时，其他时间都用在休息、吃饭、检修车辆、交换邮件等非生产时间上。实行“邮运快车”办法以后，把从乌鲁木齐到和田县划分为两大段，每段六个车，由十二个驾驶员轮换接力，六天往返一段，其中有一天保养车辆，第七天继续循环。两段车辆在大段互换邮件、分段转运。这样，报刊、邮件从乌鲁木齐到和田只需要五十九个小时，其中汽车行驶时间就有五十一个小时，沿线交换邮件，保养车辆，换车等只用八个小时。原来这条干线共有二十辆汽车、四十个驾驶员，现在只有十二辆车、二十四个驾驶员，邮件转运时间却快了三倍多。驾驶人员在接力中开车八、九个小时以后，就有二十多个小时休息，这样就保证了驾驶人员精力饱满，开车安全，同时也解决了司机长期不能很好学习的问题。
    在开展“邮运快车”时，邮电管理局把每一条干线划为一条龙，展开一条龙的大协作。“龙头”局根据报刊出版和邮车出发时间，组织人力快速装车和封车；“龙身”局（所）逐站、逐局向下站用电话预报邮运快车动态，作好交换准备。车一到站，车上车下立即交换点验，驻站休息人员也为汽车加水、加油、检修车辆，因而小站只停三至五分钟、县站只停十至十五分钟、专区站只停二十到三十分钟就能交换完毕。各条干线的“龙身”局为了保证干线正常运行，还建立了层层保干线的调度制度，当干线邮车发生意外时，立即调动最近支线的车辆、技工、材料和设备去支援。另外，还建立了一套汽车保养维修制度。“龙头”局建立保养基地，沿线按平均里程在各站建立保养组，配备保修人员和设备，全线保修工人实行日夜轮班，驾驶人员展开集体爱车竞赛，因而车辆保养工作比一人一车时作的更好。目前有20％的邮车大修间隔里程超过了二十万公里，超过十五万公里的已达52％。
