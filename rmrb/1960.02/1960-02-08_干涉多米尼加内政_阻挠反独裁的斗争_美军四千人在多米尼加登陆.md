Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 6th. According to a report today from the Cuban newspaper "Revolución," six warships of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, led by the aircraft carrier "Intrepid," carrying 4,000 U.S. Marines, landed in the Dominican capital, Trujillo City, on the 5th. On the same day, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy Department in Washington confirmed the event.

The Cuban newspapers "Revolución," "Hoy," "Combate," "Calle," and the Venezuelan newspaper "El Mundo" have all published commentaries exposing the U.S. dispatch of Marines, under the pretext of a so-called "holiday visit," to land in the Dominican Republic to interfere in Dominican internal affairs and obstruct the Dominican people's struggle against dictatorship.

Since large-scale events against the dictator Trujillo occurred in the Dominican Republic in late January, the domestic situation in the Dominican Republic has been tense, and the crisis facing the Trujillo regime, which has always been fostered by the United States, has become increasingly serious.

After Trujillo implemented frantic arrests, with thousands of people thrown into prison, instability also occurred within the Dominican ruling group and government. According to a report by the Venezuelan newspaper "El Nacional" on the 4th, Trujillo has decided to dismiss the President of the Supreme Court and some senior judges of the courts. At the same time, it has been announced that the President and professors of the University of Dominica have been dismissed, and the university is currently closed. News from San José indicates that the Dominican Chargé d'Affaires to Costa Rica, Fernandez, and his secretary, Griseldi, have resigned and requested political asylum.

According to a Washington dispatch from the Associated Press, U.S. experts studying Latin American issues in Washington, when assessing the situation in the Dominican Republic, admitted that the Trujillo regime is facing "the most severe opposition in more than thirty years."

    干涉多米尼加内政　阻挠反独裁的斗争
    美军四千人在多米尼加登陆
    新华社哈瓦那6日电　据古巴“革命报”今天报道，以航空母舰“勇猛”号为首的美国大西洋舰队的六艘军舰装载四千名美国海军陆战队，5日在多米尼加首都特鲁希略城登陆。同一天，华盛顿美国海军部发言人证实这一事件。
    古巴“革命报”、“今日报”、“战斗报”、“街道报”和委内瑞拉“世界报”都发表评论，揭露美国调遣海军陆战队借口所谓“休假性的访问”在多米尼加登陆，干涉多米尼加内政，阻挠多米尼加人民的反独裁斗争的阴谋。
    自从1月下旬多米尼加发生大规模反对独裁者特鲁希略的事件以后，多米尼加国内局势紧张，一向受美国豢养的特鲁希略政权危机日益严重。
    在特鲁希略实行疯狂逮捕、好几千人被投入监狱以后，多米尼加统治集团和政府内部也发生不稳现象。据委内瑞拉“国民报”4日报道，特鲁希略已经决定解除最高法院院长和一些法院的高级法官的职务。同时已经宣布撤销多米尼加大学的校长和教授的职务，目前这所大学已经处于停闭状态。来自圣约瑟的消息表明，多米尼加驻哥斯达黎加的外交代办费尔南德思和他的秘书格里塞耳迪已经提出辞职，并要求政治避难。
    据美联社华盛顿消息说，华盛顿研究拉丁美洲问题的美国专家们在估计多米尼加的局势时承认，特鲁希略政权面临着“三十多年来最厉害的反对”。
