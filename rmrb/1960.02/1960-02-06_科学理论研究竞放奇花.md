Scientific Theoretical Research Blooms with Diverse Flowers

    Terrestrial Stratum Generates Oil

    In the past, the majority of the world's discovered oil came from ancient marine sedimentary rock layers (i.e., marine facies strata). Therefore, for many years, the prevailing theory of oil generation was "marine facies oil generation." Scholars in capitalist countries, based on this, believed that ancient inland sedimentary rock layers (terrestrial strata) contained very little oil or were even incapable of generating oil. China has many terrestrial strata, so they deduced that "China is a poor oil country." After liberation, petroleum geological departments discovered many oil fields in the terrestrial strata of the Northwest, proving that terrestrial strata can generate large amounts of oil. But why can terrestrial strata generate oil? A group of young researchers at the Lanzhou Geological Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, after studying and analyzing years of petroleum exploration data from the Northwest region, recently proposed the theory that "inland humid depression is the basic geological condition for terrestrial oil generation."

    "Inland humid depression" means that in ancient inland basins (mainly in freshwater lakes), under humid or semi-humid climatic conditions, abundant rainfall is conducive to biological reproduction. The remains of these organisms, in areas of long-term crustal depression (subsidence), accumulate and are preserved in large quantities, and gradually transform into oil. The "humidity" and "depression" conditions emphasized here are completely different from the conditions for "marine facies oil generation."

    According to this theory, the researchers explored the distribution of oil fields in the Northwest region and made a prospective evaluation and prediction of various oil-bearing basins.

    Physiological Basis of Rational Close Planting

    Through a year of comparative experiments and observations on rice and wheat, the Institute of Plant Physiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences clarified that rational close planting is a dialectical unity of the group and the individual under certain conditions. In such a case, the individual growth and development are slightly inhibited, while the group is fully developed, so the yield is higher. If the planting is too sparse, although the individual is fully developed (within certain limits), the group performance cannot be well utilized. If the planting is too dense, the individual is damaged (physiologically deteriorated, function weakened, and growth is dysregulated), which is also detrimental to the group, so neither over-dense nor over-sparse planting can increase production. Last year, researchers studied the relationship between close planting and high yield under conditions of abundant water and fertilizer. They found that under these conditions, the development of the group in close planting is mainly limited by the intensity of light. Starting from the group structure, the distribution of light intensity, and the photosynthetic capacity of the plants, the maximum rational density and photosynthetic area can be calculated under certain light conditions. If it is less than this number, light energy cannot be fully utilized, and if it is greater than this number, light energy cannot be utilized more. This is a theoretical limit, but it is also a relative limit. If the photosynthetic capacity of the plants is improved, this limit will also be raised accordingly. The establishment of this concept of group physiology allows us to further analyze the problem of close planting, making its characteristics specific, systematic, and quantifiable. This could not have been done in the past using only the knowledge of individual plant physiology. The establishment of this concept of group physiology is a new research direction both practically and theoretically.

    High Polymer Condensation

    Synthetic fibers such as "Terylene" and fiberglass are all polyester-based polymer compounds. The Institute of Applied Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Jilin University have cooperated and made systematic achievements in the study of the condensation theory of these compounds, writing twelve papers. This result has attracted international attention. This theoretical achievement mainly solved the following four problems:

    1. Clarified the nearly thirty-year-long debate on the order of reaction. A large number of experimental results prove that the polyester reaction is neither a second-order reaction nor a third-order reaction, but a two-and-a-half-order reaction.
    2. Established a new esterification reaction mechanism, explaining the existing experimental phenomena. This is a problem that has not been clarified in the last fifty years. This work has certain guiding significance for China's polyester compound industry.
    3. Confirmed with a large amount of experimental data a basic assumption in high polymer chemical kinetics: the reaction rate constant of the same functional group of molecules is independent of the length of the molecular chain.
    4. Established a relatively complete gelation theory. This also has a great effect on guiding high polymer production.

    Atomic Nucleus Structure

    The theoretical nuclear physics group of the Institute of Atomic Energy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences used the concept of shell structure to study the energy levels of atomic nuclei near lead (Pb208). Currently, scientists in various countries have found more than sixty energy levels in experiments. After a long period of in-depth and systematic research by the researchers of this group, it has been proven that the results calculated according to this new theory are completely consistent with all the more than sixty energy levels of the experimental results. Furthermore, it also predicts some undiscovered energy levels. This research result also shows that the interaction force between two nucleons in the atomic nucleus is basically equal to the interaction force between two separate nucleons. This shows that the state of motion of nucleons in the atomic nucleus can be applied to the concept of separate particle motion. This is exactly the opposite of those who believe that shell theory cannot be used in heavy atomic nuclei.

    This work has opened a path for the further development of atomic nucleus theory.

    科学理论研究竞放奇花
    陆相地层生油
    过去世界上发现的石油，绝大部分产在古代海洋沉积的岩层（即海相地层），因此，关于石油的生成，许多年来世界上流行的理论是“海相生油”。资本主义国家的学者们就此认为古代内陆沉积岩层（陆相地层）含石油很少甚至不可能生油。我国有很多的陆相地层，因此他们就此推论“中国是个贫油国”。解放后，石油地质部门在西北陆相地层中发现了许多石油田，事实证明陆相地层能够生成大量石油。但是陆相地层为什么能生成石油？中国科学院兰州地质研究室一群年轻的研究人员研究分析了西北地区历年来的石油勘探资料，最近提出了“内陆潮湿拗陷是陆相生油的基本地质条件”的理论。
    “内陆潮湿拗陷”，就是在古代内陆盆地（主要是在淡水湖泊中）在潮湿或半潮湿的气候条件下，雨水充沛，有利于生物繁殖，这些生物死亡后的遗骸，在地壳长期拗陷（下沉）的地带，大量堆积、保存，便逐渐转化为石油。这里强调的“潮湿”和“拗陷”两个条件是和“海相生油”的条件完全不同的。
    根据这个理论，研究者探索了西北地区石油田的分布情况，并对各含石油盆地作了远景评价和预测。
    合理密植的生理基础
    经过一年来对水稻和小麦对比试验的观察测定，中国科学院植物生理研究所阐明了合理密植是在一定条件下群体和个体的矛盾统一。在这样的情况下，个体生长发育稍受抑制，而群体得到充分发展，所以产量较高；过于稀植，个体虽得到充分发展（也有一定限度），但群体性能不能很好发挥；密植过度，个体受到损害（生理上发生变质，机能衰退，生长失调），对群体也不利，所以过密过稀都不能增产。研究者去年研究了在水肥较丰裕的情况下密植和高产的关系。他们发现在这样条件下的密植，群体的发展主要受到光照强度的限制；从群体结构、光照强度的分布以及植株的光合能力出发，可以推算出在一定的光照条件下，最高的合理密度和光合面积是多少，小于这个数字，不能充分利用光能，大于这个数字，也不能多利用光能。这是一个理论限度，但这也是相对的限度，如果植株的光合能力提高，这限度也将相应地上移。这个群体生理观念的建立，使我们对密植问题得到了进一步的分析，把它的特征具体化、系统化、数量化了；这是过去只用个体植物生理学的知识所不能做到的。这种群体生理观念的建立，在实践上和理论上都是一个新的研究方向。
    高分子缩聚
    合成纤维“特丽伦”、玻璃钢等都是聚酯类的高分子化合物。中国科学院应用化学研究所和吉林大学等单位合作，在研究这类化合物的缩聚理论方面有系统的成就，写成了十二篇论文。这项结果，已引起国际上的注意。这项理论成就主要解决了以下四个问题：
    1、澄清了近三十年来关于反应级数的争论。大量的实验结果证明，聚酯反应既不是二级反应，也不是三级反应，而是二级半反应。
    2、建成了一种新的酯化反应机构，解释了已有的实验现象，这是近五十年来没有弄清楚的问题。这项工作对我国聚酯化合物工业有一定的指导意义。
    3、用大量实验数据证实了高分子化学动力学中一个基本假定：分子相同官能团的反应速度常数与分子链的长短无关。
    4、建立了一个相当完善的凝胶化理论。这对于指导高分子生产也有很大的作用。
    原子核结构
    中国科学院原子能研究所理论原子核物理组利用壳层结构的观念研究了铅（Pb208）附近原子核的能级。目前各国科学家在实验中已经找到的能级有六十多条，经过该组研究人员长时间的深入系统的研究之后，证明按这个新理论计算得到的结果和实验结果的六十多条能级全部符合。并且还预示了一部分未发现的能级。这项研究结果还表明，原子核内两个核子之间的相互作用力基本上与两个单独的核子间的相互作用力相等，这表明原子核内核子运动状态可以应用单独粒子运动的观念。这正好与那些认为重原子核内不能用壳层理论的看法相反。
    这个工作为原子核理论的进一步发展打开了一条道路。
