Artificial “Sun” Helps Surgeons See Clearly

Ultrasonic Waves Process Leather, Saving Labor
    A man-made “sun” has been created by scientific workers at the Moscow Scientific Research Institute of Medical Equipment – an extraordinary kind of lighting. This unique device is used in the operating room. With the press of a button, the small “sun” quickly turns to the direction that needs illumination, emitting light as intense and bright as sunlight. However, this instrument is far superior to the sun. Under sunlight, objects cast shadows, but this illuminator is different because it has special lights installed at all points on its disk, so it does not cast shadows. Obviously, this alleviates the doctor's work. Only a surgeon could dream of such an ideal light. In the light of the new illuminator, subtle nerves, blood vessels, and bone muscle contours can be seen with exceptional clarity. This instrument also has a magical power: it has two special ultraviolet reflectors. Diseased tissue looks completely different from healthy tissue under ultraviolet light. Therefore, it can help surgeons determine the cleanliness of the operation. In addition, ultraviolet light can kill microorganisms and purify the air. The machine is equipped with a television camera. Hundreds of people can see the surgeon's every move and hear his diagnoses in the next room. In addition, this device has camera and movie camera lenses.

    Currently, this medical light is unique in the world. Some Soviet factories will soon begin mass production.

    Using Ultrasonic Waves to Process Leather

    Trucks loaded with cow and sheep skins drive into the Moscow Leather Factory every day. After appropriate processing, the hides become leather for soles and linings. The Moscow Leather Factory uses the latest scientific and technological achievements in processing leather.

    The factory's experimental station has installed a high-frequency generator with ultrasonic attachments. Ultrasonic waves can accelerate and improve the tanning process of sole leather and other production stages. There is also a unique electronic measuring machine, which has been used in industry for half a year. This excellent machine saves a lot of labor and can measure 300,000 square decimeters of leather in one shift.

    Taking Pictures with Ordinary Paper

    Is it possible to take pictures with ordinary writing paper? Photography originally requires special photographic paper and special developers and fixers. However, Soviet scientists have newly invented a method of electrical photography. This method of photography does not require special photographic paper or special processing agents. Electrical photography can also be used to receive facsimile telegrams.

    What are the characteristics of this new method of recording images?

    The electrical signals transmitted through the communication channel are converted into light pulses in the receiver. The receiver's drum is covered with a semiconductor photosensitive layer, which is charged. Due to the effect of light pulses on the surface of the semiconductor layer, the charge changes according to the brightness of the emitted photograph, creating an invisible image. Applying a special black resin powder to the drum makes the image clearly visible. Then, by placing a piece of ordinary paper on the drum, a picture sent by the other party can be printed.

    Tests conducted in the laboratory have proven that the new photography method can simplify and speed up the transmission of facsimile telegrams and can greatly reduce telegram costs.

    人造太阳帮助外科医生明察秋毫
    用超声波加工皮革节省大量人力	  人造“太阳”
    莫斯科医疗器械设备科学研究所的科学工作者制成一颗人造小“太阳”——一种迥非寻常的照明灯。这一独特的装置是在手术室里使用的。只要按一下按钮，小“太阳”就敏捷地转到需要照射的方向，发出像太阳光一样强烈明亮的光来。然而这种仪器比太阳要优越得多。在太阳照射下，物体要投射出影子，可是这个照明器却不同，因为在它的圆盘的各点上都装着专门的灯光，因而不会投射出影子。显然这能减轻医生的工作。这种理想的照明灯只有外科医生才能幻想。在新照明灯的光线下，能异常清楚地看到细微的神经、血管、骨肌曲线。这仪器还具有一种神奇的力量：有两个特殊的紫外线反射器。患病的组织在紫外线照射下，和健康组织完全不一样。因此，就能帮助外科医生判明手术进行的洁净程度。此外，紫外线还能消灭微生物、净化空气。这机器上装着电视摄像机。上百的人能在邻室看到外科医生的每一个动作，听到他的诊断意见。此外，这种装置有摄影机和电影摄影机镜头。
    目前，这盏医疗灯是世界上独一无二的。苏联一些工厂不久即将开始大批生产。
      用超声波加工皮革
    满载牛羊皮的载重汽车每天源源不断地开进莫斯科皮革厂。在这里进行适当加工后，毛皮就变成鞋底和鞋里用皮革了。莫斯科皮革厂在加工皮革时采用了最新科学技术成就。
    工厂试验站安装了一台带有超声波附加装置的高频率发电机。超声波能加速和改进鞋底用皮的鞣制过程以及其他各个生产阶段，另外还有一台独特的电子测量机器，它已在工业中运用半年了。这一卓越的机械节省了很多人力，在一个班次内能测量三十万平方分米的皮革。
        用普通纸照像
    用普通书写纸能照像吗？照像本来是需要特制的感光纸以及专门的显影剂和定影剂的。但是，苏联科学家新发明了一种电力照像法。用这种方法照像，既不需要特制感光纸，也不需要专门的加工药剂。电力照像还可以用来接收传真电报。
    这种新的记录影像的方法有什么特点呢？
    经过通信通路传来的电力信号在收报机里变成光脉冲。收报机的鼓轮复盖着半导体感光层，这种感光层带有电荷。由于半导体层表面光脉冲的作用，电荷根据发射出的照片的明暗不同发生变化，造成不可见的影像。将带电荷的特制黑色树脂粉敷撒在鼓轮上，影像就变得清晰可见。这时只要在鼓轮上放一张普通的纸，就可以印出对方发射出来的像片了。
    在试验室所做的试验证明，新照像法能简化并加快传真电报的发射，还可以大大降低电报成本。
