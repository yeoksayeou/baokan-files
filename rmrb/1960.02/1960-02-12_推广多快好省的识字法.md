Promote the "More, Faster, Better, and More Economical" Literacy Method
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

    The characteristic of Wanrong County's work in eliminating illiteracy is its speed and high quality. More importantly, it has consolidated and expanded the results of literacy efforts, thereby eliminating the phenomenon of relapse into illiteracy. Students who have become literate are eagerly reading a large number of popular reading materials. Wanrong County has a population of 210,000, but within a short month, more than 180,000 copies of phonetic reading materials were sold, and the demand still exceeded the supply. This shows that these students have not only truly escaped illiteracy, but their reading ability is also rapidly improving.

    Wanrong County has truly solved the problem of consolidating and rapidly improving the results of literacy efforts, which is the most prominent achievement of their literacy work.

    This achievement is due to their adoption of the phonetic literacy method, which involves spending about 20 hours to enable students to master the phonetic alphabet, and then using the phonetic alphabet as a tool to teach Chinese characters for about 100 hours, so that students can meet the standards for graduating from literacy classes. After students become literate, they consolidate and continuously improve their skills through extensive reading of phonetic reading materials and extensive writing. Some students have read several books, some have read dozens of books, and some have read more than a hundred books. Through reading, they have expanded their vocabulary and improved their writing skills. The farmers of Wanrong County, based on their own personal experience, call phonetic literacy the "more, faster, better, and more economical literacy method," which is very reasonable. Phonetic literacy also has an added benefit, which is that through extensive reading of phonetic reading materials, the pronunciation of Chinese characters is unified, and Mandarin Chinese is naturally promoted.

    Wanrong County's experience once again proves that the phonetic alphabet has opened a shortcut for literacy work; phonetic literacy is a shortcut for the intellectualization of workers and peasants.

    Some people worry that "phonetic literacy will affect the timely completion of literacy tasks." Facts have proved that phonetic literacy does not delay but accelerates the speed of literacy, so it will not delay the completion of literacy tasks. In fact, allowing the masses to master a self-study tool that is greatly conducive to consolidation and improvement will only make the literacy task completed faster, better, and more solidly.

    Others worry that learning the phonetic alphabet will hinder the learning of Chinese characters. They think that after learning the phonetic alphabet, they will have to "throw away the crutch" eventually, and they cannot "move" without throwing it away. The Qinggu Village Library in Wanrong County originally had 700 books, and few people borrowed them. After phonetic literacy was implemented, 6,000 copies of phonetic reading materials were added, and the library was crowded with people, sometimes waiting outside the door before dawn to borrow books. Moreover, not only phonetic reading materials are being borrowed, but even the 700 books without phonetic notation are now being borrowed by most people. The concern that reading phonetic newspapers and books will prevent one from reading general newspapers and books, or that one cannot "move" without "throwing away the crutch," is unfounded.

    Some people believe that "phonetic literacy is good, but it requires training a large number of teachers, which is too difficult." Indeed, in order to promote phonetic literacy, it is necessary to train a certain number of key personnel. This is a difficulty, but it can be overcome. During the Spring Festival, the Jinan Special District of Shanxi Province organized one million young and middle-aged people to learn the phonetic alphabet, and mobilized 400,000 primary and secondary school teachers and students throughout the district to conduct package teaching during the winter vacation, with an average of one teacher for every two and a half students. Not only does Jinan have such conditions, but other provinces, other special districts, and other counties throughout the country also have them. It can be seen that the problem of teachers can also be solved.

    However, some people believe that "illiteracy is about to be eliminated, so phonetic literacy is superfluous." It is true that since 1958, we have eliminated a large number of illiterates, and the achievements have been great. However, there are still many illiterates who are undergoing literacy learning or will be undergoing literacy learning. There is also the issue of consolidation and improvement after becoming literate. When mobilizing literate students to enter spare-time schools, there is a difference in efficiency, speed, and results between having the phonetic alphabet as a tool and not having it. The experience of Wanrong County proves that the phonetic alphabet is not only a good tool for eliminating illiteracy, but also a good tool for consolidating and expanding the results of literacy efforts. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to propose phonetic literacy now and to use the phonetic alphabet to consolidate and expand the results of literacy efforts.

    Phonetic literacy and the use of the phonetic alphabet to consolidate and expand the results of literacy efforts are fully in line with our urgent requirements today to rapidly eliminate illiteracy, vigorously develop workers' and peasants' spare-time education, and rapidly improve the political, cultural, and technical level of workers and peasants. It is fully in line with the spirit of the general line of building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. Therefore, the experience of Wanrong County should be affirmed and promoted step by step. Currently, Shandong, Anhui, Hubei, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Hebei and other provinces and regions are vigorously promoting the experience of Wanrong County on the basis of summarizing their own pilot work experience. Other regions should also, according to local conditions, refer to the experience of Wanrong County, first do a good job in pilot work, and then promote it. We wish them greater achievements in the work of eliminating illiteracy after promoting the experience of Wanrong County.

    推广多快好省的识字法
    本报评论员
    万荣县扫除文盲工作的特点是，速度快，质量高，而更加重要的却是巩固和扩大了扫盲成果，从而消除了回生复盲的现象。脱盲后的学员，大量阅读通俗读物，如饥似渴。万荣县的人口是二十一万，但在短短的一个月之内，注音读物却销行了十八万余册，仍然供不应求。这说明了这些学员不但已经真正摆脱了文盲状态，而且他们的阅读能力也正在迅速地提高着。
    万荣县真正解决了巩固和迅速提高扫盲成果的问题，这是他们扫盲工作中最突出的成绩。
    这个成绩的获得，是由于他们采用了注音扫盲的办法，就是：先以二十小时左右的时间，让学员掌握拼音字母，然后再以一百小时左右的时间，用拼音字母作工具，教学汉字，使学员达到扫盲毕业标准；学员脱盲之后，通过大量阅读注音读物和大量写作，使之及时巩固和继续不断的提高。学员们有的读了几本书，有的读了几十本，有的已经读了一百多本。通过阅读，扩大了识字量，也提高了写作能力。万荣县的农民根据自己亲身的体验，把注音扫盲叫做“多快好省的识字法”，是很有道理的。注音扫盲还有一个附带的好处，就是通过大量阅读注音读物，统一了汉字的读音，自然也推广了普通话。
    万荣县的经验，再一次证明：拼音字母为扫盲工作开辟了一条捷径；注音扫盲是使工农群众知识化的捷径。
    有的人耽心，“注音扫盲会影响扫盲任务的及时完成”。事实证明：注音扫盲不是推迟了，而是加快了扫盲速度，因此不会耽误扫盲任务的完成。事实上，让群众掌握一种大大有利于巩固和提高的自学工具，只会使扫盲任务完成得更快、更好、更扎实。
    还有人耽心，群众学了拼音字母会妨害对于汉字的学习。他们以为学了拼音字母，回头还得“丢拐棍”，不丢就不能“搬家”。万荣县青谷村图书室，原有七百册书，很少有人去借。注音扫盲以后，添置了六千册注音读物，门庭若市，有时天不亮就有人在门外等着借书。而且不仅注音读物有人借，现在连那七百册不带注音的书，大部分也开始有人借了。以为读了注音书报不能读一般书报，以为不“丢拐棍”就不能“搬家”，这种顾虑是没有根据的。
    有的人认为：“注音扫盲好是好，就是要训练大批师资，困难太大。”的确，为了推行注音扫盲，需要训练一定的骨干。这是一个困难，但是这个困难是可以克服的。山西晋南专区在春节期间组织一百万青、壮年人学习拼音字母，发动全区四十万中小学师生利用寒假进行包教，平均每两个半学员就有一个老师。这样的条件，不仅晋南有，全国其他省、其他专区、其他县也都有。由此可见，师资问题也是可以解决的。
    但是，也有的人认为：“文盲快要扫完了，注音扫盲是多此一举”。不错，1958年以来我们扫掉了很大一批文盲，成绩很大，但是，也还有不少文盲，正在进行识字学习，或将要进行识字学习。脱盲以后还有巩固提高问题。动员脱盲学员进业余学校后，有拼音字母这个工具和没有拼音字母这个工具，效率有高低之分，速度有快慢之别，结果是不一样的。万荣县的经验证明：拼音字母不仅是扫盲的好工具；而且也是巩固和扩大扫盲成果的好工具。因此现在提出注音扫盲，提出利用拼音字母来巩固和扩大扫盲成果，是完全必要的。
    注音扫盲以及利用拼音字母巩固和扩大扫盲成果，完全符合我们今天迅速扫除文盲、大力发展工农业余教育、高速度地提高工农群众的政治文化技术水平的迫切要求，完全符合多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的精神，因此万荣县的经验，应该加以肯定，并应有步骤地加以推广。目前在山东、安徽、湖北、内蒙古、黑龙江、四川、陕西、河北等省区，正在总结自己试点工作经验的基础上，大力推广万荣县的经验。其他地区，也应该根据当地的具体条件，参照万荣县的经验，首先做好试点工作，然后加以推广。我们预祝他们在推广万荣县的经验后，在扫除文盲工作上，作出更辉煌的成就。
