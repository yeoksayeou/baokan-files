“Three Increases and One Emphasis” Lies in “One Increase”

	This year, the rape in Xindu County is growing exceptionally well. Adhering to the revolutionary spirit of striving for perfection, people are seizing the crucial moments of growth – opening of the plate, bolting, flowering, and pod formation – to launch a mass movement of “Three Increases and One Emphasis” (increasing branches, increasing pods, increasing grains, and emphasizing grain weight) to vow to seize high yields.

	The "Three Increases and One Emphasis" is determined by "One Increase," which is to increase enthusiasm. To achieve "Three Increases and One Emphasis," it cannot be empty talk; one must put in hard work. Look at the enthusiasm of the people of Xindu County! As soon as they were told to apply fertilizer, many commune members came and went in the wind and rain, even sacrificing their Spring Festival holidays. Each commune generally shortened the interval of fertilizing from once every ten days or half a month to once every five to seven days. As soon as they were told to control pests, the county immediately established more than 500 medical teams to patrol the fields and treat insects as soon as they were seen. Even the Class III seedlings have no "dejected mood" and are optimistically "catching up" with the Class I seedlings...

	The important source of the masses' enthusiasm lies in adhering to the principle of putting politics in command. The responsibility of leaders lies in strengthening political and ideological work from beginning to end, and constantly using work methods such as evaluation and competition, holding on-site meetings, and organizing visits to launch mass movements on a large scale, so as to continuously push the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses to new heights.

### “三增一重”在于“一增”

    “三增一重”在于“一增”
    新都县今年油菜长得出类拔萃，人们本着精益求精的革命精神，抓紧开盘、抽苔、开花和结荚的生长关键时刻，展开了一个“三增一重”（增枝、增荚、增粒和粒重）誓夺高产的群众运动。
    “三增一重”决定于“一增”，这就是增添干劲。要做到“三增一重”，不能是纸上谈兵，必须付出辛勤的劳动。请看，新都县人民的干劲吧！一说要追肥，许多社员风里来、雨里去，甚至牺牲春节休假，各公社普遍由原来每十天半月追一次肥，缩短到五至七天追一次肥；一说要治虫，全县立即建成了五百多个医疗队，巡逻田间，见虫就治，三类苗也毫无“颓唐情绪”，正在乐观地向一类苗“看齐”……。
    群众干劲的重要源泉，在于坚持政治挂帅。领导者的责任，在于自始至终地加强政治思想工作，经常运用评比竞赛、召开现场会、组织参观等大搞群众运动的工作方法，把群众的革命干劲不断地推向新的高潮。
