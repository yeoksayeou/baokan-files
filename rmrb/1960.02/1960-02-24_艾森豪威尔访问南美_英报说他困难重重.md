Xinhua News Agency, London, 22nd. British "Observer" newspaper commented on February 21st on Eisenhower's visit to South America, saying that this visit "is perhaps the most difficult trip this president has ever made," because "to Latin Americans, the United States is an imperialist country."

The article points out that Eisenhower's visit does not include the three countries of Peru, Venezuela, and Panama, although Panama is of "strategic importance" to the United States, and the United States relies heavily on Venezuelan oil and has economic ties with Peru. The article traces back to Vice President Nixon in 1958 when he "was pelted with stones" in Peru, and "had an even worse experience in Venezuela." This lesson was revisited in Panama at the end of last year.

The article says that despite this, the four countries that the US president will visit, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay, "are important to the United States," "they all have votes in the United Nations and influence the attitudes of Latin American countries." The article also says that these four countries are not satisfied with the United States. "To most Chileans, the United States is a country that buys Chilean copper cheaply and sells it at a high price," and "Argentina dislikes the United States even more."

### 艾森豪威尔访问南美  英报说他困难重重

    艾森豪威尔访问南美
    英报说他困难重重
    新华社22日讯　伦敦消息：英国“观察家报”21日在评论艾森豪威尔的南美之行时说，这次访问“也许是这位总统所作过的旅行中最困难的一次”，因为“对拉丁美洲人说来，美国是帝国主义国家”。
    文章指出，艾森豪威尔这次访问不包括秘鲁、委内瑞拉和巴拿马这三个国家，虽然巴拿马对美国有“战略意义”，美国在很大程度上要依靠委内瑞拉的石油而和秘鲁又有经济联系。文章追溯说，尼克松副总统在1958年在秘鲁“被掷石头”，“在委内瑞拉的遭遇更坏”。去年末在巴拿马重温了这次教训。
    文章说，尽管如此，美国总统要访问的巴西、阿根廷、智利和乌拉圭这四个国家“对美国说来是重要的”，“它们在联合国都有投票权，并且左右着拉丁美洲国家的态度。”文章又说，但是这四个国家对美国都并不是满意的。“对大多数智利人说来，美国是一个以贱价买智利铜而以高价出售的国家”，而“阿根廷更不喜欢美国”。
