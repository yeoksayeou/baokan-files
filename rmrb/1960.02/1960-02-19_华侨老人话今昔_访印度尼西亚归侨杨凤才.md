    Overseas Chinese Elder Talks About Past and Present
    —An Interview with Returned Overseas Chinese from Indonesia, Yang Fengcai
    By our reporter Lü Xiangyou
    A two-story building with white walls shone brightly in the morning sun. In front of the courtyard, a large patch of lemongrass exuded a fragrant aroma in the breeze. Amidst laughter, we entered the Home for the Elderly at the Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm in Hainan Island. Recently, it has received several elderly people who have just returned from Indonesia. One of them, tall and wearing reading glasses, was wearing a leather jacket. Wrinkles covered his face, etched with the bitterness of the past. He is seventy-six-year-old Yang Fengcai. This elder told us that since returning to the motherland, he suddenly feels much younger. Indeed, judging from the expression on his face, he does not look like someone nearing eighty.
    Elder Yang Fengcai led us to his room, a sun-filled space. Another elder, also recently returned from Indonesia, was also living there. They both excitedly pointed to the newly received cotton clothing, quilts, underwear, washbasins, kettles, and white mosquito nets, saying: The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are so thoughtful in caring for us overseas Chinese returning from abroad!
    The elders were very satisfied with the government's arrangements for them. They were provided with three meals a day, with food featuring a strong southern flavor. After meals, they engaged in free activities according to their own preferences. Some played chess, some played poker, some read newspapers, and others strolled and chatted in twos and threes under the coconut trees. They could see a movie at least once a month. These elders all had a habit of loving labor. They often caught tobacco worms in their own tobacco fields. Elder Yang Fengcai, for example, would get up as soon as it was dawn. Once he was up, he couldn't sit still, either cleaning the environment or finding something to do, driven by a sense of ownership.
    Elder Yang Fengcai now lives a very happy life. But the misfortunes of the past have not been forgotten.
    1906 was a very difficult year. That year, even bran and vegetables were not enough to fill people's stomachs. Hunger forced twenty-two-year-old Yang Fengcai to leave his relatives and hometown—Shuikou Village, Gaozhou Wuchuan County, Guangdong Province—with tears in his eyes. He was sold by water traders as a "piglet" to a mining company on Bangka Island. The indenture clearly stated that he had to work three hundred and sixty days for the Dutch colonialists before he could redeem his body.
    That's how Yang Fengcai drifted overseas, struggling on the brink of death. Yang Fengcai said that in that long period, tin ore never left his shoulders. Over time, his waist bent, and his hair turned gray. At this point, the capitalists kicked him out of the mine. The life of a vagrant tormented him. Whenever the wind and rain came, he couldn't even find a place to hide. When he was at his wit's end, he had no choice but to go into the deep mountains and forests to cut timber and firewood, working as a porter for others to make a living.
    Born into a poor family, Elder Yang Fengcai spent fifty-three years in hardship overseas, and as a result, he never even established a family. This time, he returned to the motherland alone. This weathered elder finally told the reporter excitedly: "Now our long-cherished wish buried in our hearts has been realized, and we no longer have to worry about our lives in our later years."

    Yang Fengcai couldn't help but get excited when recalling the bitter experiences of the past.
    The elders love to do some light work. Look how lush the tobacco they grow is!
    They care about the socialist construction of the motherland, and reading the newspaper every day has become a habit.
    Facing the beautiful landscape of the motherland, the elders feel boundless happiness.

    华侨老人话今昔
    ——访印度尼西亚归侨杨凤才
    本报记者　吕相友
    一座二层楼房，白白的墙壁被晨光照得格外发亮。院子前面的大片香茅，随风散发着扑鼻的清香。在一片欢笑声中，我们走进了海南岛国营兴隆华侨农场敬老院。这里最近接待了几位刚刚从印度尼西亚回来的老人。其中有一位，身材高大，戴着一副老花镜，上身穿着一件皮夹克，满脸的皱纹，刻划着过去的辛酸经历，他就是七十六岁的杨凤才。这位老人告诉我们，他自从回到祖国以后，忽然变的年轻了许多。的确，从他说话的神情来看，不像是年近八旬的人。
    杨凤才老人引导我们到了他的住室，这是一间充满着阳光的屋子。里面还住着另一位也是刚从印度尼西亚回来的老人。他们都兴高彩烈地指着刚领到的里面三新的棉衣、棉被、卫生衣、脸盆、水壶和白白的蚊帐说：共产党、毛主席对我们从海外归来的侨胞，照顾的多周到啊！
    老人们对政府对他们的安排感到十分满意，每日三餐，饭菜都带有浓厚的南国风味。饭后，就按照自己的爱好自由活动，有的下棋，有的打扑克，有的读书报，还有的三三两两在椰林下漫步交谈。他们每个月至少能看到一次电影。这些老人都有爱劳动的习惯，他们经常在自己种植的烟草地里抓烟虫。像杨凤才老人，天刚朦朦亮就起床了，一起来就闲不住，不是清扫环境卫生，就是找些什么活干干，一种主人翁的思想在支使着他们的行动。
    杨凤才老人，现在过着非常幸福的生活。可是过去的那些不幸并未使他忘怀。
    1906年，这是一个非常难度的年月。那一年连糠菜也装不满人的肚皮，饥饿迫使二十二岁的杨凤才不得不含泪离开亲人和故乡——广东省高州吴川县水口村，被当时的水客当作“猪仔”卖给汶岛一家矿务公司。在卖身契上写得一清二楚，要给荷兰殖民主义者做满三百六十个劳动日，期满后才能赎回自己的身体。
    杨凤才就是这样飘泊到海外，挣扎在死亡线上。杨凤才说，他在那一段漫长的日子里，肩上没有一天离开过锡矿砂，天长日久他的腰弯了下来，头发斑白了。这时候资本家就把他赶出矿山。流浪的生活折磨着他，每当风雨一来，连藏身之处都找不到。在走投无路的时候，他只好到深山密林里去伐木、砍柴，替别人当挑伕维持生活。
    出身于贫苦家庭的杨凤才老人，在海外整整苦度了五十三年，结果连个家庭都没有建立起来，这次只身回到了祖国。这位饱经风霜的老人，最后激动地告诉记者：“现在我们埋藏在内心的多年愿望实现了，再也不为晚年的生活担忧了。”

    杨凤才回想起过去的辛酸经历，不禁有些激动起来
    老人们都爱做些轻微的劳动，瞧他们种的烟草多么茂盛
    他们关心祖国的社会主义建设，每天读报已成了习惯
    面对着祖国的锦绣河山，老人们感到无限的幸福
