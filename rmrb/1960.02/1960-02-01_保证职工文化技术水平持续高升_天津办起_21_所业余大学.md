    Guarantee the Continuous Improvement of Workers' Cultural and Technical Level
    Tianjin Establishes 21 Spare-Time Universities

    (Our dispatch) Tianjin, after eliminating illiteracy among workers, has established 21 workers' spare-time universities (including one radio correspondence university) while simultaneously establishing spare-time primary and secondary schools to organize workers for advanced studies, achieving remarkable results.

    Tianjin's workers' spare-time universities are run by the municipal district education bureaus, various industrial systems, and some factories. These spare-time universities have more than 50 specialties and departments, including mechanical manufacturing, electrical machinery manufacturing, textiles, chemicals, Chinese language, and history. Each department is set up in accordance with the specific characteristics and needs of the production and construction development of its system or factory. About 27,000 people participate in the study, including workers, cadres, technicians, primary and secondary school teachers, etc. Most of them have long-term labor practice and rich production knowledge and skills. The school system of each worker's spare-time university is generally set for three to five years, and after graduation, the students reach the same level as graduates of corresponding departments in regular institutions of higher learning. Most of the study time is 18 to 20 hours per week. In addition to full-time teachers, engineering and technical personnel from the system and factory are also hired as part-time lecturers. Some workers' spare-time universities also use the method of linking up with regular institutions of higher learning to solve the problem of insufficient teachers.
  
    Although the establishment time of Tianjin's workers' spare-time universities is not long, they have achieved remarkable results. It has improved the technical and theoretical knowledge level and self-study ability of workers and technical cadres; because the study is combined with production, students quickly apply the theoretical knowledge they have learned to their actual work, improving work efficiency; after workers and technical cadres master theoretical knowledge, it provides a theoretical basis for further carrying out technical innovation and invention, and at the same time, it is also convenient for veteran technical workers to summarize technical experience. Therefore, workers say that studying at workers' spare-time universities is a key to promoting production and technological innovation. Zhang Lianshan, a worker at the Tianjin Hoisting and Transportation Equipment Factory, used the pulley principle and drawing theory learned at the university to create a threading machine with other workers, changing the past manual operation method. Veteran workers studying in the university class run by the factory also collectively studied and improved the crane using the lever principle and gear transmission principle, which greatly reduced the labor intensity of the workers and improved production efficiency. Li Zhiqiang from the No. 3 Power Plant used to only know how to operate machines and did not understand the principle. He found some reference books, but he could not understand them. After participating in spare-time university studies, he learned some theoretical knowledge, and now he can not only understand the relevant reference books, but also apply the knowledge he has learned to his work. He once used some formulas on triangles to create a conversion table for active power and reactive power, and made a reactive load conversion curve, so that the work that used to be converted by technicians can now be obtained by ordinary apprentices in a few seconds. Workers' spare-time universities not only improve the technical and theoretical level of workers, but also directly promote current production and cultivate working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert. It is an important measure to implement the Party's two-pronged approach in cultivating senior construction talents.

    In order to run the workers' spare-time universities well, party organizations at all levels actively solved the problem of teachers for the universities, uniformly arranged and guaranteed the workers' study time, organized special personnel to compile applicable teaching materials, and gradually consolidated and developed the schools. In the teaching work, all spare-time universities closely combined with production and enriched the teaching content by selecting problems in production; in teaching, teachers and students studied each other, and some teachers also compiled jingles to help students remember difficult formulas, so that students could learn quickly and remember firmly.

    At present, party organizations at all levels in Tianjin are further combining with production reality and needs to continue to adopt various forms to develop spare-time universities, so as to cultivate more senior construction talents as soon as possible to meet the needs of Tianjin's industry developing towards high, precision, large, and cutting-edge directions.

### 保证职工文化技术水平持续高升  天津办起21所业余大学

    保证职工文化技术水平持续高升
    天津办起21所业余大学
    本报讯　天津市在扫除职工文盲后，办起了业余小学、业余中学的同时，办起了二十一所职工业余大学（内有广播函授大学一所），组织职工进修，取得了显著成绩。
    天津市的职工业余大学是由市内各区教育局、各产业系统和一些工厂分别举办的。这些业余大学分别设有机械制造、电机制造、纺织、化工、中文、历史等五十多个专业科系。各个科系都是结合本系统、本厂生产建设发展的具体特点和需要设置的。参加学习的约有二万七千多人，其中有工人、干部、技术员、中小学教师等，绝大部分人有较长时间的劳动实践和丰富的生产知识、技能。各个职工业余大学的学制，一般定为三至五年，毕业后学员达到正规高等院校相应科系毕业生的同等水平。学习时间，大部分每周学习十八至二十小时；除设专职教师外，还聘请本系统、本厂的工程技术人员兼职讲课，有的职工业余大学还采用与正规高等院校挂钩的方法，解决了师资不足的问题。
  天津市各职工业余大学建立的时间虽然不长，但是已取得显著成绩。它提高了工人、技术干部的技术理论知识水平与自修能力；因为结合生产进行学习，学生把学到的理论知识很快地应用到实际工作中去，提高了工作效率；工人和技术干部掌握了理论知识以后，为进一步开展技术革新、搞发明创造提供了理论基础，同时，还便于老技术工人总结技术经验。因此，工人们说职工业余大学的学习是促进生产推动技术革新的一把钥匙。天津市起重运输设备厂的工人张连山，利用在大学学到的滑轮原理和制图等理论知识，和其他工人一起创制了套丝扣的机器，改变了过去手工的操作方法。在这个厂办的大学班学习的老工人，还利用杠杆原理、齿轮变速原理等，集体研究改进了吊车，大大地减轻了工人的劳动强度，提高了生产效率。发电三厂李志强，过去只会操纵机器，不懂原理，找了一些参考书，但是又都看不懂。参加业余大学学习以后，学了一些理论知识，现在不但可以看懂有关的参考书，而且把学到的知识运用到工作中去。他曾利用三角上的一些公式，做出了有功功率无功功率换算表，制出无功负荷换算曲线，使过去要由技术员换算的工作，现在一般徒工就可以在几秒钟内得出结果来。职工业余大学既提高了职工的技术理论水平，又直接推动了当前生产，培养着又红又专的工人阶级知识分子，它是贯彻党在培养高级建设人材工作中两条腿走路方针的一个重要措施。
    各级党组织为了办好职工业余大学，积极为各大学解决了师资问题，统一安排并且保证了职工学习时间，组织专人编写了适用的教材，使学校逐步得到巩固发展。各业余大学在教学工作中都密切结合了生产，并且选择生产中的问题充实了教学内容；教学中，教师与学员互相研究，有的教师还编了顺口溜帮助学生记忆难懂的公式，使学生学得快、记得牢。
    目前，天津市各级党组织都在进一步结合生产实际与需要，继续采取各种形式发展业余大学，以便尽速地培养出更多的高级建设人材，以适应天津市的工业向高、精、大、尖方向发展的需要。
