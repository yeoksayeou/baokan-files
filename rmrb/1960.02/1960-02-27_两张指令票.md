As soon as I entered the dispatch room, I felt the unusual busyness here. The phone kept ringing, and people hurried in and out, one after another. The duty dispatcher handled one problem after another, answering one phone call after another, with barely a moment to spare.

One morning, the biting north wind howled wildly, and sleet dripped down – the weather was very cold. As people in the dispatch room were busy, the door was suddenly thrown open, and a chubby young man rushed in like a whirlwind. He looked very anxious, covered in oil stains, with a lock of wet hair hanging over his forehead. He quickly closed the door and shouted breathlessly:

“The filter belt screw is broken! Quickly issue a ticket to make ten new ones, or we’ll have to stop production!”

Seeing his appearance and hearing his tone, everyone in the room felt that the problem was indeed serious. The duty dispatcher didn’t delay, clarified the specifications, and immediately issued an instruction ticket, adding a large, red “Urgent” stamp to the ticket.

“Take this to the machine repair workshop immediately, delivery within four hours!” the dispatcher said in a comforting tone.

Not long after the chubby young man left, another person burst into the room, looking reckless and starting to argue before even standing still.

“How did you estimate this man-hour?”

I looked up and saw an old worker, about fifty years old. He held the instruction ticket with the bright red “Urgent” stamp in his hand, waving it angrily in front of the dispatcher.

“What’s wrong, Master Wang?” the dispatcher greeted him gently.

“Four hours to turn out ten belt screws? Isn’t this nonsense? Can you even do it?”

“This is urgently needed for production!”

“Who doesn’t know it’s urgent? The process itself takes that much! What do you want me to do?”

“You need to summon up more drive…” the dispatcher stood up, trying to persuade the fiercely angry man.

“What? Isn't our drive enough?” Master Wang rudely interrupted him, trembling with anger.

It seemed that only I could break the deadlock, so I went up and asked Master Wang:

“How long do you say it will take to complete?”

“Working non-stop, it will take five hours,” Master Wang answered gently, seeing that I was a stranger. “The workload is too large, it’s really difficult!”

I said to the dispatcher:

“If it really can’t be completed, then change it!”

The dispatcher reluctantly took the instruction ticket and changed a number on it.

“Why didn’t you start construction first and then come to give your opinion? How much work has been delayed by this?” Before leaving, the dispatcher, still angry, gave the old man one last jab.

“Don’t worry, young man! I already arranged the work, I came after starting construction!” Master Wang finally smiled, waved his hand, and left.

Less than eight or nine days after this incident, another new dispute occurred. It was also a morning, and although the weather was still cold, it was a clear and bright day. The dispatcher was frantically dealing with inquiries from all sides at the same time, and the door was gently pushed open. It was the same chubby young man, but his expression was very different: his face was flushed, and his hair was neatly combed. He slowly walked to the dispatcher and said softly:

“Please issue a ticket, we need to make ten sets of belt screws.”

“What, did they break again?” The dispatcher was nervous when he saw him.

“No, it’s not!” The chubby young man waved his hands repeatedly, quickly stating: “After the Party Committee mobilized to launch a technical innovation upsurge a few days ago, our maintenance team jointly studied it and made some improvements to the belt installation method. The life of the screws has been extended by more than ten times, and they don't break so easily anymore. These are for spare parts!”

“Oh, is that so,” the dispatcher breathed a sigh of relief and happily picked up his pen to issue another instruction ticket. I glanced at it and saw that he had filled in a “5” in the “Man-hours” column, and nodded in relief:

“This time there won’t be any more quibbling…”

Unexpectedly, not long after the chubby young man left, Master Wang rushed in again. He was still holding the same instruction ticket, and shouted loudly as soon as he entered the door:

“How did you estimate this man-hour?”

“Why are you here again?” I thought unhappily, feeling that this old man was really strange.

“Five hours still isn’t enough? You comrade are too outrageous, everyone else is making a great leap forward, can you still be dragging your feet?” The dispatcher was impatient and criticized the old man sternly.

“Who are you saying is dragging their feet?” Master Wang was trembling with anger again.

“You!” the dispatcher pointed at him righteously.

Then, the two of them argued back and forth, sentence after sentence. I was afraid that they would argue for too long and affect the work, so I quickly interrupted them and asked Master Wang: “How long do you say it will take?”

“Twenty minutes!”

“What?!” The dispatcher and I almost blurted out at the same time. The dispatcher wanted to confirm whether his ears had really malfunctioned, and asked again:

“Is that for one set?”

“What one set? Complete delivery! Twenty minutes to deliver ten sets, guaranteed quality and quantity!” Master Wang shouted at the dispatcher, his anger obviously lessened.

“What’s going on? I still looked at him puzzled, eager to know the beginning and end of this “strange thing”.

“Didn’t you listen to Secretary Chen’s report?” he asked me rhetorically.

“I listened!” I nodded, not understanding what connection this report could have with belt screws.

“This is the flower that Secretary Chen’s report has bloomed!” Master Wang said happily: “After studying the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, everyone’s drive is very high. After Party Committee Secretary Chen made a report on launching an upsurge of technical innovation, everyone’s hearts became even brighter. A few days ago, several of us pondered for a long time next to the bed and created an automatic nesting turntable, which reduced seven processes at once. In addition, we organized the study of Ma Xueli’s high-speed cutting method, and the work efficiency was improved even more. This kind of belt screw used to take half an hour per set, now it only takes two minutes!” Ten sets, isn’t that just twenty minutes?

“My good Master, why didn’t you say so earlier?” the dispatcher exclaimed in surprise.

“You put a label on me as soon as I entered the door, what was I supposed to say?” Master Wang glared at him, smiling and annoyed!

“This instruction ticket should still be changed!” I said.

“Of course, of course…” The dispatcher agreed happily, snatched the instruction ticket from Master Wang’s hand, and started to change it.

    两张指令票
    李北桂
    一走进调度室，就感到这里异常忙碌。电话铃不断响着，行动匆忙的人一个接着一个。值班调度员应接不暇地处理了一个又一个问题，接完了一次又一次的电话。
    一天上午，刺骨的北风呼呼地狂啸，夹雪的雨点滴滴??地下着，天气很冷。调度室里人们正在忙着，忽然，门猛地一下被撞开了，紧接着，一个胖小伙子像阵旋风似的闯进屋来。他神色很急，满身油污，一绺湿淋淋的头发搭在前额上，他顺手将门关上，气喘吁吁地大声嚷道：
    “过滤机皮带螺丝断了！赶快下票做十套新的，不然就得停产！”
    看他这模样，听他这口气，屋里的人都觉到问题确实严重。值班调度员更不怠慢，问明了规格，立即开了一张指令票，又在票上加盖了一个又大又红的“急”字。
    “马上拿到机修车间去，四小时内交货！”调度员带着安慰的语气说。
    胖小伙走了不多一会，又一个人冒冒失失地闯进屋来，脚没站稳，就吵了起来：
    “你这工时是怎么估的？”
    我抬头一望，这是一位五十岁左右的老工人。他手里拿着刚才那张盖有鲜红“急”字的指令票，怒冲冲地在调度员面前挥舞着。
    “怎么啦，王师傅？”调度员和气地招呼着他。
    “四小时车十套皮带螺丝这不是胡闹么？你干得了？”
    “这是生产上急用的！”
    “谁不知是急用的？操作上就有那么多的过程嘛！你叫我咋办？”
    “你们要鼓足干劲呵……”调度员立起身来，企图要说服这个气势凶凶的人。
    “什么？我们的干劲还不足？”王师傅粗暴地打断他的话，气得直打哆嗦。
    看样子，只有我才能打破这个僵局，于是，我便走上去问王师傅道：
    “你说要多长时间才能完呢？”
    “一气不歇地干，也得五小时。”王师傅见我是个陌生人，便换个口气温和地答道。“工作量太大，确实有困难呵！”
    我向调度员说道：
    “如果确实完不成，就更改一下吧！”
    调度员满不高兴地接过指令票，在上面改了一个数目字。
    “你为什么不先施工，然后才来提意见？这阵又耽误了多少工？”临走，调度员还余怒未息地“将”了老头一“军”。
    “放心吧，小伙子！早就把活安排好了，开始施工后我才来的！”王师傅这才露了笑容，扬扬手走了。
    这件事情过去不到八、九天，又发生了一次新的纠纷。这也是一个上午，天气虽也很冷，却是一个爽朗朗的大好晴天。调度员正在手忙脚乱地同时应付着来自各方面的询问，屋门被轻轻地推开了。还是那个胖小伙，但是，神色却大不相同：满面红光，头发整齐地梳着。他慢条斯理地走到调度员面前，轻轻地说道：
    “请你开一张票，我们要作十套皮带螺丝。”
    “怎么，又断了么？”调度员看见是他，不觉紧张起来。
    “不，不是的！”胖小伙连连摆手，赶紧声明着：“前两天党委动员要掀起技术革新高潮以后，我们维护小组共同研究了一下，把皮带的安装方法作了一番改进，那螺丝的寿命延长了十好几倍，再也不那么轻易折断了。这是作为备品用的！”
    “原来是这样，”调度员放心地嘘了口气，愉快地拿起笔，又开了一张指令票。我留神看了一眼，见他在“工时”一栏上填写了一个“5”字，才安心地点点头：
    “这回准不会再扯皮了……”
    不料，胖小伙刚走不一会，那位王师傅又匆匆忙忙地闯了进来。还是拿着刚才那张指令票，一进门又高声嚷道：
    “你这工时是怎么估的？”
    “怎么又来了？”我不悦地想，觉得这老头实在有些怪。
    “五小时还不行？你这同志也太不像话了，别人都在大跃进，你们老拉后腿还行？”调度员不耐烦了，严肃地批评着这个老头。
    “你说谁拉后腿？”王师傅又气得直哆嗦。
    “你！”调度员理直气壮地指着他。
    于是，两人又你一句我一句地争执起来。我怕他们争得太久，要影响工作，便赶忙打断他们，问王师傅道：“你说究竟要多久？”
    “二十分钟！”
    “什么？！”我和调度员几乎是同时冲口而出。调度员想要证实一下自己的耳朵是否真的发生了故障，又问了一句：
    “是一套么？”
    “什么一套？全部交工！二十分钟交完十套，保质保量！”王师傅冲着调度员大声嚷着，火气显然小了。
    “是怎么回事？我仍不解地望着他，心里急于知道这件“怪事”的始末。
    “你没听陈书记报告么？”他反问我。
    “听了哇！”我点点头，弄不清这报告和皮带螺丝会有什么联系。
    “这就是陈书记的报告开的花！”王师傅快活地说道：“学习八中全会决议后，大家干劲很大。党委陈书记作了要掀起技术革新的高潮的报告后，大家心里更亮堂了。前两天，我们几个人在床子旁琢磨了很久，搞了个自动套料的转盘，一下减少了七个工序。再加上又组织学习了马学礼高速切削法，工效就提得更高了。像这种皮带螺丝过去要半小时一套，现在只要二分钟就行了。”十套不就是二十分钟么？
    “我的好老师傅，你为啥不早说呢？”调度员惊喜地叫了起来。
    “一进门你就给我扣帽子，叫我说什么？”王师傅又笑又恼地瞪了他一眼！
    “这指令票还是更改一下吧！”我说。
    “当然，当然……”调度员满心喜悦地答应，抢过王师傅手里的指令票就更改起来。
