Terraced fields surround the mountains layer upon layer,
Plots of garden land are irrigated with clear water;
Poplars wear hats, apple trees have waists,
Mulberry branches are inlaid on the edges of the fields.

The dams are built strong and sturdy,
Sediment and sand can no longer run away;
The winding mountain road is so good,
The truck delivers manure, no need for people to carry it.

    临县水土保持民歌
    层层梯田围山绕，
    块块园田清水浇；
    白杨戴帽苹果腰，
    田埂边上镶桑条。
    坝堰打的牢又牢，
    泥沙再也跑不了；
    盘山公路多么好，
    车子送粪人不挑。
