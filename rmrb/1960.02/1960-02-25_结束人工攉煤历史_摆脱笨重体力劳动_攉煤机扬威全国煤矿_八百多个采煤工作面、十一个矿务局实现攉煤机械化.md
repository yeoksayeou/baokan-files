    Xinhua News Agency, 24th dispatch: Coal loading machines, affectionately known as "little iron oxen" by miners, have been widely promoted in coal mines across the country in just over a month. According to statistics from the Ministry of Coal Industry regarding forty-four larger mining bureaus, more than 800 coal faces are now using various lightweight coal loading machines. The Fuxin, Jiaozuo, Liaoyuan, Jiaohe, and Pingxiang mining bureaus, among eleven others, have fully achieved coal loading mechanization, thereby freeing up a significant amount of labor to support other production departments.
    The widespread promotion and use of coal loading machines is an important measure for the coal industry this year to achieve sustained leaps forward and free miners from heavy physical labor. Since liberation, the level of mechanization in China's coal mines has been continuously improving. The main coal mines have achieved mechanization in processes such as coal cutting, coal transportation, and roof support. However, in terms of coal loading, aside from some hydraulic mining, combined coal mining machine operations, automatic sliding, and other work areas that fundamentally do not require coal loading, a considerable number of work areas still maintained the backward state of manual coal loading. Manual coal loading consumed a lot of labor and had low efficiency, which was a weak link in coal mine production. In the second half of last year, workers at the Fuxin Coal Mine successfully created three different types of coal loading machines in response to this situation. The common characteristics of these coal loading machines are: simple structure, easy operation, and low material consumption. General mine machinery repair factories can manufacture them, and the coal loading efficiency is four to five times higher than manual labor. Therefore, the appearance of these coal loading machines immediately attracted the attention of coal mine workers across the country. Many coal mines, upon receiving the news, immediately sent engineers and workers to visit and learn, and notified the machine repair shops to immediately manufacture according to the drawings. Miners, especially coal loading workers, were overjoyed to see the coal loading machines and eagerly learned how to use them. They said, "With these fellows, continuing the great leap forward this year is a sure thing." Many coal mines, such as Kailuan, Jingxing, and Datong, basically achieved coal loading mechanization within a few days.
    In order to consolidate and improve the achievements of coal loading mechanization, all mines have adopted a combination of strengthening leadership and launching mass movements, and have carried out in-depth competitions among coal loading workers to learn from the advanced, compare with the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and help the backward. Through technical performance competitions and observation and dissemination, the Fuxin Ping'an Mine established 236 model coal loading drivers, and the technical level of coal loading workers has greatly improved. Initially, it generally took ten seconds for a coal loading machine to make a round trip; now it has been shortened to about six seconds. After continuous improvement, many coal loading machines have become more suitable for the conditions of different geological formations and workplaces in various mines. Some coal loading machines have undergone significant development on their original basis. For example, a coal loading machine suitable for thin coal seams created by the Shuangyashan Coal Mine in Heilongjiang Province not only concentrates on the advantages of the Fuxin Coal Mine's Red Flag No. 1 coal loading machine, such as simple structure and convenient operation, but also installs electric transmission equipment, so that the coal loading machine can automatically load coal even in thin coal seams. At present, all forty-eight main coal faces in this mine have used this type of coal loading machine, and the coal loading efficiency of thirty-two of these faces has increased by one to three times.

    结束人工攉煤历史　摆脱笨重体力劳动
    攉煤机扬威全国煤矿
    八百多个采煤工作面、十一个矿务局实现攉煤机械化
    新华社24日讯　被矿工们亲昵地称为“小铁牛”的攉煤机，短短一个多月来已在全国煤矿中普遍推广。据煤炭工业部对四十四个较大矿务局的统计，目前已有八百多个采煤工作面用上了各种轻便的攉煤机，阜新、焦作、辽源、蛟河、萍乡等十一个矿务局已全部实现攉煤机械化，从而节约出了大量劳动力支援其他生产部门。
    广泛地推广使用攉煤机，是煤炭工业今年实现持续跃进，摆脱矿工笨重体力劳动的一项重要措施。我国煤矿机械化程度解放以来不断提高，各主要煤矿的落煤、运煤、放顶等工序都已实现机械化；但是在装煤方面，除开一部分水力采煤、联合采煤机采煤、自动滑落等根本用不着攉煤的工作面以外，相当大的一部分工作面还保持着人工攉煤的落后状况。人工攉煤耗用劳动力多，效率低，是煤矿生产中的一个薄弱环节。去年下半年，阜新煤矿工人针对这一情况创造成功了三种不同类型的攉煤机。这些攉煤机的共同特点是：结构简单，操作容易，用料很少，一般矿山机械修理厂都会制造，攉煤效率却比人工高四倍到五倍。因此，这些攉煤机一出现，立刻引起全国煤矿职工的重视。许多煤矿得到消息后，当天就派工程师和工人去参观学习，并且通知机修厂立刻按照图纸制造。矿工们，特别是攉煤工人们看到攉煤机以后，更是如获至宝，争先学习使用。他们说：“有了这家伙，今年继续大跃进是铁打的了。”开滦、井陉、大同等很多煤矿，在几天之内就基本上实现了攉煤机械化。
    为了巩固和提高攉煤机械化的成就，各矿都采用加强领导和大搞群众运动相结合的办法，在攉煤工人中深入开展了学先进、比先进、赶先进、帮后进的竞赛。阜新平安矿通过技术表演赛和观摩传布，树立了二百三十六名攉煤司机标兵，攉煤工人的技术水平有了很大提高。开始时攉煤机往返一次一般要十秒钟，现在已缩短到六秒左右。许多攉煤机经过不断改进以后，已经更加适合各矿不同地层地质和工作场所的条件。有的攉煤机在原有基础上有了很大发展。例如黑龙江省双鸭山煤矿创造的一种适合于薄煤层的攉煤机，不但集中了阜新煤矿红旗一号攉煤机结构简单、操作方便的优点，而且安上了电力传动设备，使攉煤机即使在薄煤层中也能自动装煤。目前，这个矿的四十八个主要采煤工作面已经全部用上了这种攉煤机，其中三十二个工作面的攉煤效率提高了一倍到三倍。
