    Rhubarb
    In the rich treasure trove of medicinal materials in Guoluo, rhubarb is the most abundant. In Chinese medicine shops, rhubarb is sold in small slices measured in fen and qian, but in the Guoluo National Trade Bureau, rhubarb is piled up like mountains. During the rhubarb harvest season, in addition to the commune members working tirelessly in the mountains all day long for rhubarb production, almost all the office cadres and their families are mobilized to participate in rhubarb processing. There is so much rhubarb here that if you casually walk into any cadre's dormitory, the first thing you see is not decorative paintings on the wall, but long strings of rhubarb being dried. After the rhubarb is dug out of the mountains, it must be cut with a knife to remove the coarse skin and fine tails, threaded with fine thread on the tails, and hung indoors to dry in the shade. It cannot be exposed to the sun, as it will turn black and harden, becoming substandard goods. Therefore, drying rhubarb has become the obligatory labor of the cadres here. Before liberation, Qinghai's annual rhubarb production reached a maximum of 800,000 jin, while Guoluo harvested 6,019,700 jin of rhubarb in 1959 alone, more than six times the highest annual output in the entire province before liberation. The Dangxiang Commune in Maqin County even dug out a "Rhubarb King" weighing 120 jin. Guoluo Tibetan herdsmen often say, "In the old society, rhubarb was plentiful, so much so that it was used as firewood; in the new society, rhubarb is good, rhubarb has become a priceless treasure." This not only illustrates the extremely rich rhubarb production in Guoluo, but also illustrates the two different fates experienced by the herdsmen who produced rhubarb in the old and new societies.

    大黄
    在果洛丰富的药材宝库中，以大黄最多。大黄，在中药店里是以分、钱计量的小片片，但是果洛民族贸易局里却有着堆积如山的大黄。大黄丰收的季节，除了公社社员整天为生产大黄在山上不停地忙碌以外，几乎所有的机关干部和干部家属都动员起来参加了大黄加工工作。这里的大黄实在是太多了，你只要随便走到哪个干部的宿舍里去看一下，第一眼看到的不是墙上的装饰画，而是一长串一长串正在晾干的大黄。大黄从山中挖出后，要用小刀削去秧槎粗皮和细尾，用细毛线穿在尾上，挂在室内阴干，不能晒，见太阳就发黑变硬，成为次货。因此，晾干大黄便成了这里干部的义务劳动。青海在解放前年产大黄最高达八十万斤，而果洛在1959年一年之中便采挖大黄六百零一万九千七百多斤，超过解放前全省最高年产量的六倍多。玛沁县党项公社还挖出了一株一百二十斤的“大黄王”。果洛藏族牧民常常这样说：“旧社会，大黄多，大黄多了当柴烧；新社会，大黄好，大黄成了无价宝。”这不仅说明果洛出产极丰富的大黄，也说明在新旧社会生产大黄的牧民们所经历的两种不同的命运。
