    This is No Small Matter
    The Beijing Civil Electrical Appliance Factory has manufactured a simple washing machine and put it into production. According to usage results, this washing machine can wash more than 200 pieces of clothing per hour, equivalent to the manual labor of forty people. Some living service units and childcare organizations in Beijing and Harbin have also recently self-made various simple washing machines. This is a technological innovation that has not yet attracted much attention, but it is a very important innovation.
    A washing machine is for washing clothes; it neither produces nor creates anything. However, clothes get dirty and need to be changed and washed, which is a daily necessity for everyone, and therefore occupies a lot of labor. Small things cannot withstand being calculated on a large scale. Isn't that so? Many housewives have to wash clothes every day; there is a specialized washing and dyeing industry to serve the people; and in industrial and mining enterprises, medical units, and commercial systems, a large number of work clothes need to be washed frequently. Therefore, washing clothes, from the perspective of the entire society, is not a small matter because it is universal, large-scale, and frequent, but a big thing that requires the payment of a large amount of labor. In collective units such as industrial and mining enterprises, washing work clothes is also related to production or work. Washing by hand inevitably occupies a lot of labor. But a simple washing machine is equivalent to the labor of several people. It can be imagined how much labor will be saved if industrial and mining enterprises widely adopt washing machines, and how much wealth this labor will create for the country when invested in production. Moreover, washing machines also have the benefit of protecting clothes and saving soap. After widespread adoption in industrial and mining enterprises, they can also save materials for the country. As for the washing and dyeing industry adopting this equipment, it can further shorten delivery times and facilitate the masses. From this perspective, the simple washing machine is also a flower in the technological innovation movement, with its practical significance and its social significance, and it should be promoted in a planned and step-by-step manner.
    In ordinary times, we often encounter simple labor that seems to be a trivial matter in life, but in the midst of this, there is often a huge potential for labor. For example, we all have to wear shoes. The vast majority of people in our country like to wear cloth shoes, and the soles of cloth shoes are sewn with one stitch and one thread. Our country has a large population, and how much labor is spent on sewing shoe soles every year is an astonishing number if calculated precisely. Can machines replace manual labor? Yes. Now, simple sole-sewing machines have appeared in many places such as Shandong, Gansu, Beijing, Tianjin, and so on. The simple sole-sewing machine made by the Beijing Second Children's Shoe Cooperative can equal the labor of seventy-three people. Another example is that every city has a large number of sanitation workers who clean the streets every day. For a long time, the main tool they have used is a broom. Can we discard the broom and use machinery? Yes. Beijing has recently created foot-pedaled tricycle sweepers, motorized tricycle sweepers, and car-modified dust sweepers, both indigenous and foreign, with high efficiency. A motorized tricycle sweeper improves efficiency by eleven or twelve times compared to manual labor. In January of this year, we published an editorial discussing the reform of cooking utensils in public canteens and the catering industry, which is also of the same nature. If we pay attention, there are many more of these so-called trivial matters around us. Moreover, a large amount of labor potential can be excavated from these small matters.
    Currently, a massive technological innovation movement is being carried out in our country. When we mention technological innovation and technological revolution, we cannot only think of the production sector and ignore the living service sector. Of course, technological innovation and technological revolution in production enterprises can directly improve our country's production level, and is the most important aspect of the entire technological innovation and technological revolution movement; however, technological innovation and technological revolution in the living service sector is also an important aspect. In the living service sector, manual operations still account for a large proportion. Low-efficiency manual operations make it difficult to fully meet the needs of construction development and the masses. With the gradual improvement of people's living standards, the demands on the living service sector are also getting higher and higher. If reforms are not carried out, it will become increasingly unable to meet the needs of the masses. The situation in which the living service sector occupies a large amount of labor cannot be maintained for a long time. Because the labor force in society is always limited, if this sector occupies too much, that sector will inevitably decrease. If the living service sector occupies too much, it will affect the production sector's need for labor. Production and construction are developing by leaps and bounds, and the service content of the living service sector will also continue to expand. If we do not find a way out through technological innovation, and society cannot provide so much labor, the development of business will be affected, not to mention saving labor to support production and construction. Improving efficiency and service quality in the living service sector will have a positive impact on production and construction. Using the least manpower, material resources, and time to do the most things, and doing things well, is our principle at all times. The living service sector should continuously improve efficiency through technological innovation, and keep pace with the production and construction sectors at a high level of efficiency.
    In the past two years, technological innovation in the living service sector has made considerable progress, many new tools have appeared, and labor efficiency has improved. However, to change the situation in which the service industry largely adopts manual operations, more technological innovation is needed. Because manual operations still account for a relatively large proportion in the service industry, technological innovation and technological revolution have broad scope. Every innovation, large and small, can significantly improve efficiency, and every machine that appears can save a lot of labor. As long as we are not bound by habitual forces, as long as we can see the significant meaning of small things, use our brains more, and create boldly, technological innovation will achieve greater achievements and will serve the masses better.
    Any creation is for universal use. Carrying out technological innovation, of course, cannot remain at the creation stage, otherwise its meaning and value will be reduced. Every successful innovation and creation should be quickly promoted in order to universally improve labor efficiency. Now, various cooking machines and simple machines such as washing machines, sole-sewing machines, and street sweepers that can save a lot of labor have appeared. Relevant departments should immediately start organizing appraisal and promotion work. Of course, for these machines, promotion should be carried out according to actual needs and possibilities, and with different priorities. For example, farmers have always been accustomed to wearing cloth shoes, and the demand is large, so the promotion of sole-sewing machines should focus on people's communes. The promotion of washing machines should focus on cities and larger industrial and mining enterprises. As for street sweepers, they can only be applied to cities at present. Promotion must also be carried out in steps, from indigenous to foreign, and gradually improved according to needs and possibilities. In the process of promoting these machines, production units, especially local enterprises, should enthusiastically provide support and help improve them, so that the performance of these machines is more perfect, more efficient, and easier to use.
    The emergence of technological innovations such as simple washing machines and kitchen utensil reforms gives people a lot of inspiration. Some small things around us, on closer reflection, are not small matters. As long as we create some simple machines, or slightly reform existing tools, a large amount of labor will be liberated, and a large amount of wealth will be created. The torrent of technological innovation and technological revolution is constantly pushing our country's industrial and agricultural production to a higher level. We believe that the staff and workers in the living service sector will certainly be able to create more achievements in the mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution, serve the masses better, and give the masses more convenience.

### 这不是小事

    这不是小事
    北京民用电器厂制成简易洗衣机投入生产了。根据使用的结果，这种洗衣机每小时可以洗衣服二百多件，能顶四十个人的手工劳动。北京、哈尔滨市的一些生活服务单位和托儿组织，最近也自制成了各种简易洗衣机。这是一件还没有引起更多人注意的技术革新，但这是一个很重要的革新。
    洗衣机，是洗衣服用的，它既不生产什么，也不创造什么；然而衣服穿脏了，要换，要洗，却是每个人日常生活的需要，因而也就占用不少的劳动。小事情禁不得算大账。不是吗？许多家庭妇女天天要洗衣服；社会上有专门的洗染行业为人们服务；在工矿企业、医疗单位、商业系统，更有大量的工作服需要经常洗涤。所以，洗衣服，从整个社会的角度来看，由于它是普遍的、大量的、经常的，就不是什么小事，而是一件需要支付大量劳动的大事情。在工矿企业等集体单位，洗工作服又是和生产或工作有关的事情。用手工洗，必然占用很多的劳动力。而一部简易洗衣机，却等于若干人的劳动。可以设想，工矿企业等如果普遍采用洗衣机，将会节约多少劳动力，这些劳动力投入生产，又将为国家创造多少财富。何况洗衣机还有保护衣物节约肥皂的好处，工矿企业等普遍采用之后，还能为国家节约物资。至于洗染行业采用这种设备，更可以缩短交货时间，便利群众。由此看来，简易洗衣机也是技术革新运动中的一个花朵，有它的实际意义，也有它的社会意义，应当有计划有步骤地来推广它。
    在平时，我们还常常会遇到一些看来是生活小事的简单劳动，但在这中间，却往往蕴藏着巨大的劳动潜力。比如我们人人都要穿鞋。我国广大人民都喜欢穿布鞋，而布鞋的鞋底，是一针一线纳成的。我们国家人口众多，每年用在纳鞋底上的劳动该有多少，如果作出精确的计算，将是一个惊人的数量。能不能用机器代替人工？能。现在，山东、甘肃、北京、天津等等好些地方已出现了简易纳底机。北京第二童鞋社制成的简易纳底机，一台能顶七十三个人的劳动。再比如每个城市都有大批清扫工人，每天清扫街道。他们长期以来使用的主要工具是一把扫帚。能不能丢掉扫帚使用机械？能。北京市最近就创造了脚踏三轮扫路机、摩托三轮扫路机和汽车改装的扫尘车，有土有洋，效率很高，一部摩托三轮扫路机比人工提高效率十一、二倍。今年1月间，我们发表社论论及公共食堂和饮食业的炊具改革，也属同类性质。只要留意，在我们身边这一类的所谓小事还有不少。而且，从这些小事中都可以挖掘出大量劳动力的潜力。
    目前在我们国家内正开展着一个规模浩大的技术革新运动。提到技术革新和技术革命，我们不能只想到生产部门，而忽视生活服务部门。当然，生产企业中的技术革新和技术革命，能够直接地提高我国的生产水平，是整个技术革新和技术革命运动中最主要的方面；但是，生活服务部门的技术革新和技术革命，也是一个重要的方面。在生活服务部门，目前手工操作还占很大比重。低效率的手工操作，难以充分满足建设的发展和群众的需要。随着人民生活水平的逐步提高，对生活服务部门的要求也越来越高，如果不加改革，就愈来愈不能满足群众的需要。生活服务部门占用大量劳动力的状况，是不能长期维持的。因为社会上的劳动力总是有限的，这个部门占用多了，那个部门势必减少，生活服务部门占用多了，就会影响生产部门对劳动力的需要。生产建设在飞跃发展，生活服务部门的服务内容也将不断扩大，如果不从技术革新中寻找出路，社会上又不可能提供那样多的劳动力，业务的开展就会受到影响，更不用说节约劳动力支援生产建设了。生活服务部门提高了效率，提高了服务质量，对生产建设就会发生促进的影响。用最少的人力、物力和时间来做最多的事情，并且把事情做好，在任何时候都是我们的原则。生活服务部门应该通过技术革新，不断地提高效率，和生产建设部门一起在高效率的水平上并驾齐驱。
    近两年来，生活服务部门的技术革新有了不小的发展，许许多多的新工具出现了，劳动效率提高了。但是要改变服务行业大量采取手工操作的状况，还需要更多的技术革新。由于服务行业手工操作比重还较大，技术革新和技术革命就有着广阔的天地，每一项大大小小的革新都能显著地提高效率，每一种机械的出现，都能节约大量的劳动力。只要不被习惯势力所束缚，只要能透过小事看到它的重大意义，多动脑筋，大胆创造，技术革新就会取得更大的成就，就能为群众生活服务得更好。
    任何创造都是为了普遍使用。进行技术革新，当然不能停留在创造阶段，否则就降低了它的意义和价值。每一项成功的革新创造，都应当迅速推广，以便普遍地提高劳动效率。现在，炊事用的各种机械和洗衣机、纳底机、扫路机这类能够节约大量劳动力的简易机械出现了，有关部门应该立即着手组织鉴定和推广的工作。当然，对于这些机械，应该按照实际需要和可能，分别先后缓急加以推广。例如农民历来习惯穿用布鞋，需要量大，推广纳底机就要以人民公社为主要对象。而洗衣机的推广，则应以城市和较大的工矿企业为重点。至于扫路机，目前还只能适用于城市。推广也必须要有步骤，根据需要和可能，由土到洋、逐步提高。在推广这些机械过程中，生产单位特别是地方企业应该热情地加以支援，帮助改进，以便使这些机械的性能更加完善，效能更高，更便于使用。
    简易洗衣机、食堂炊具改革这一类技术革新的出现，给人许多启发。我们身边的一些小事，细细想来，并非小事，只要创造一些简易机械，或把原有工具稍加改革，就会有大量的劳动力解放出来，就会有大量的财富创造出来。技术革新和技术革命的洪流正把我国的工农业生产不断推向更高水平。我们相信，生活服务部门的职工同志们，也一定能够在技术革新和技术革命的群众运动中创造出更多成绩，为群众服务得更好，给群众更多的便利。
