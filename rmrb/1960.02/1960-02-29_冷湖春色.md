We came to Lenghu. Lenghu, like to thousands upon thousands of petroleum workers, possesses an infinitely alluring charm for us.

The car crossed one hill after another, and then drove into the boundless field of wind-eroded hills. From afar, these wind-eroded remnants look like ancient cities buried in the desolate sands, with distinct steps and broken walls. Countless pointed earth towers stand tall and outstanding amidst the dust. On this side, dignified "mansions" with round tops stand; on the other side, countless "streets and alleys" are winding and secluded. Who is this great architect? It is the wind. The wind, year after year, tirelessly carves and sculpts this desolate desert "ancient city."

By the time our car passed through these intermittent "ancient cities" scattered along the road, it was already dark. At this moment, a vast expanse of lights suddenly appeared in the distance, stretching for dozens of miles, illuminating half the sky. Derricks pierced the clouds, and the sounds of drilling rigs, tractors...made one feel as if standing before a roaring, rushing waterfall. This is Lenghu; the magnificent Lenghu, the rugged and bold Lenghu, awakened from thousands of years of slumber!

Lenghu is located in the northwest of the Qaidam Basin. To its west are rows of red hills, climbing from the south and winding northwest; to its north, the Altun Mountains stand abruptly on the edge of the Gobi Desert, their peaks covered with glittering ice and snow, flashing scarlet light. Extending from the mountains into the middle of the Gobi are rows of mountain spurs, like a string of small islands floating on the sea. Looking east, there is a vast Gobi Desert, boundless and desolate, stretching to the end of the sky. Countless tall drilling towers stand on the Gobi, mocking the wind and sand rolling across the Gobi with an unshakable and challenging demeanor.

People say: Lenghu is full of treasures. This is not an exaggeration. On this vast land, drilling rigs are everywhere, and oil layers can be drilled everywhere. People also say: The weather here is warming up, and there is more rain, so Lenghu should be renamed. One worker even made a statement for this purpose, requesting that Lenghu be renamed "Oil Lake."

We were fortunate enough to witness the magnificent scene of an oil well gushing oil. Amidst the red hills, a stream of yellowish-brown smoke, more than ten zhang high, shot straight into the sky like a volcanic eruption, sweeping across space. The roaring sound was deafening, and the oil column of crude oil, like an infinitely long sharp sword, burst out from the depths of the formation, screaming and roaring.

We have seen female oil workers busily working everywhere on the oilfield. Some of them have just stepped out of school, and some were previously housewives. Despite this, their enthusiasm is by no means weaker than that of male workers in other departments. On the oilfield, I heard many touching stories about them:

One cold night, the oil pipe was gradually freezing. The female workers on duty searched everywhere for hot water, wanting to pour the hot water into the rubber inner tube to warm the oil pipe. But it was late at night, and the door of the water room was tightly closed, and people were already asleep. What to do? These young female oil workers, without hesitation, took off their warm old sheepskin coats and covered the oil pipe tightly. The girls ensured the normal flow of oil in this way.

Among the first group of geologists who stepped on the ice and snow of the Altun Mountains, endured hunger and thirst, and hammered their way to Lenghu with geological hammers, setting up the first tent in this desolate Gobi Desert and naming it "Lenghu," there were female comrades; the first shift to deliver letters and newspapers to the exploration team working day and night in the Lenghu area was also female comrades; the first to transport daily necessities from other places to Lenghu was also female comrades. Now, they are even more ubiquitous in all walks of life here.

Lenghu, this is a newly emerging city. In order to rename Lenghu, the Party Committee Secretaries of the Petroleum Bureau and some leading comrades, after repeated research, finally decided to rename it "Kunte City." The small towns surrounding it are Luoyan Pond, Siwangzhuang, Suliuzhuang, Dayoumiao... and so on. Now, free public buses have been opened between the various towns, running every two hours.

Kunte, this is the future central city of the oil region. Construction workers are working day and night to lay the foundations of the office buildings. The construction site presents a busy scene. In order to solve the difficulty of material sources, the workers came up with various methods: they used reeds to tie into bundles, bent them into arches, and covered them into roofs; they used adobe to build walls, and welded tin can boxes together to make doors and windows. Everything was locally sourced, cheap, and fast. The inside and outside of the houses were smoothed and clean, the blue paint on the doors and windows gleamed, the inside of the house was vaulted, and the glass was clean and bright, with ample light. Everyone who saw it praised it. The workers proudly said: "This is a 'three-no' house, no steel, no wood, no cement."

Now, batches of construction fighters are coming to Lenghu from all directions. Lenghu will be a modern, large-scale petroleum base that will appear on the Gobi Desert, and will be our country's future golden oil city!

    冷湖春色
    赵光裕　赵赤武
    我们来到了冷湖。冷湖对于我们，也像对千千万万的石油工作者一样，具有着无限诱人的魅力。
    车子越过一个山岗又一个山岗，接着就驶进了无边无际的风蚀丘群里。远远看去，这些风蚀残丘，真像似一座座埋在荒沙里的古城，台阶历历、断垣残壁。在尘烟中巍然挺立着无数座尖顶的土塔，拔萃超群。这一边，庄重地矗立着一幢幢圆顶的“大厦”；那一边无数的“街里巷弄”曲折幽森。这伟大的建筑者是谁呢？是风。风，成年累月不知疲倦地雕钻和刻划这荒漠的“古城”。
    当我们的汽车穿过了这断续的、分布在沿路上的“古城”时，天已经暗下来了。这时，远方大片的灯火骤然出现在眼前，连绵十数里，映亮了半边天。井架耸入云天，钻机、拖拉机??的响声，使人感到有如站在一条汹涌奔腾、一泻千里的大瀑布的面前一般。这就是冷湖；气势磅礴的冷湖，粗犷豪放的冷湖，从千万年的沉睡中醒来的冷湖啊！
    冷湖，座落在柴达木盆地的西北部，它的西边是一溜溜红色的山岗，由南爬来，蜿蜒曲折的向西北伸去；北边，阿尔金山猛然屹立在戈壁边缘，山顶冰雪晶莹，闪出绯红色的光辉。由山边伸进戈壁中间来的是一排排山棵，像一列列小岛浮动在海面上。展眼东望，是一片辽阔的戈壁滩，茫茫苍苍，一直延续到天的尽头。无数座高高的钻塔立在戈壁滩上，以一种不可动摇的挑战的神情，傲然地嘲笑着戈壁上滚过的风沙。
    人们说：冷湖处处都是宝。这话一点都不假。在这广阔无边的土地上，到处摆满了钻机，到处都能钻到油层。人们还说：这里天气变暖了，雨水也多了，应当把冷湖改个名字了。有一位工人同志就曾为此发表过一个声明，他要求把冷湖改名为“油湖”。
    我们有幸看到过一次油井喷油的绮丽情景，在那一片片红色的山包中间，一股鹅黄色的浓烟，高达十余丈，直冲云霄，像火山喷发，卷过太空。??的响声震耳欲聋，原油的油柱像一柄无限长的利剑，从地层深处迸发出来，嘶叫着，狂啸着。
    我们曾在采油场上，看到处处奔忙着的采油女工。她们有的是刚刚走出校门，有的过去是家庭妇女。尽管是这样，她们的干劲绝不弱于其他部门的男工。在采油场上，我听到很多关于她们的动人的故事：
    在一个寒冷的夜里，油管渐渐要被冻住了，值班的女工们四处去寻找热水，想要把热水灌进胶皮内胎里，以便温热油管。但夜已很深，水房的门早已紧紧关上，人们都已经熟睡了。怎么办呢？这些年轻的采油姑娘们一个个毫不犹疑的脱下了身上暖烘烘的老羊皮大衣，紧紧的盖在油管上。姑娘们就是这样保证了油管的正常出油。
    第一批踏着阿尔金山腰的冰雪，忍着饥渴，用地质锤一锤锤敲到冷湖，在这荒无人烟的戈壁滩上搭起了第一个帐篷，并且定下了“冷湖”的命名的一群地质队员中，就有着女同志；第一班开始为在冷湖地区日夜工作着的勘探队员们往来传送家书，投递报刊的就是女同志；第一个把生活日用的必需品，从外地运到冷湖的也正是女同志。现在，她们在这里更遍布了各行各业。
    冷湖，这是一个新兴的城市。为了替冷湖更名，石油局党委书记们和一些领导同志，经过多次研究，最后确定改名为“昆特市”。它的周围的几个小城，是落雁池，四望庄，苏柳庄，大油苗……等等。现在，各个城镇之间，已经开辟了免费乘坐的公共汽车，每隔两小时往来一趟。
    昆特，这是油区未来的中心城市，建筑工人们正在日夜的打着办公室的地基。工地上呈现着一片繁忙的景象。为了解决材料来源的困难，工人们想出了各种各样的办法：他们用芦苇扎成把，弯成弓形，盖成房顶，他们用土坯砌墙，用罐头盒子拼焊起来做门窗。一切都是就地取材，又便宜，又快速。房子的里里外外抹得平平整整，白白净净，门窗的蓝漆放出油光，房内是拱顶，玻璃擦得净明通亮，光线充足。看过的人们没有不赞赏的。工人们自豪地说：“这是三不用的房子，不用钢，不用木料，不用水泥。”
    现在，成批成批的建设战士，正从四面八方开到冷湖来。冷湖，将是戈壁滩上就要出现的一个现代化的、大型的石油基地，将是我们祖国未来的金色的油城！
