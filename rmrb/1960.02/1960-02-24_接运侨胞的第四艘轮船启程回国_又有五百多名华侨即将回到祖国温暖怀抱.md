Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 23rd. The "Hai Huang" (Sea Emperor) , the fourth ship sent by the Chinese government to bring back overseas Chinese from West Java who were displaced by anti-Chinese activities, left Tanjung Priok Port in Jakarta today carrying more than 570 overseas Chinese, heading home. To date, more than 2,140 displaced overseas Chinese have returned home on the first four ships sent by the motherland.

A group of overseas Chinese from Sukabumi who boarded the ship today received a warm reception and care from the staff of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and the ship's crew who were helping them at the port.

Huang Zhen, the Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia, staff from the embassy, and representatives from the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese went to the pier to see them off.

Like the first three ships sent by the motherland, the "Hai Huang" left Tanjung Priok Port today amidst cheers, enthusiastic applause, and the sound of firecrackers.

Among the overseas Chinese on board the "Hai Huang," more than 320 came from the Ciamis and Banjar areas. Because some other overseas Chinese who were displaced in anti-Chinese activities were unable to reach Jakarta from their residential areas, they waited on the ship for three days. But they had a very pleasant life on board during these days. The ship's crew held photo exhibitions about the great changes in the motherland, and the rapid development of the motherland made them rejoice. Some of them even formed groups to learn to sing songs such as "Ode to the Motherland".

Serious anti-Chinese activities had occurred in the Ciamis and Banjar areas. Many of the overseas Chinese on this ship had been detained by local authorities for a month or even two months. Now all they are thinking about is that they will soon return to the warm embrace of the motherland. Every corner of the ship is filled with a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere.

Today, more than 1,500 relocated overseas Chinese from Subang and Karawang arrived in Jakarta. They will return to the motherland on the other two ships sent by the motherland, the "Rossiya" and the "Yakutia". These two ships are scheduled to arrive here tomorrow.

    接运侨胞的第四艘轮船启程回国
    又有五百多名华侨即将回到祖国温暖怀抱
    新华社雅加达23日电　中国政府派来接运西爪哇在排华活动中流离失所的华侨回国的第四艘轮船“海皇号”，今天载运着五百七十多名华侨离开雅加达丹绒不碌港回国。至此，已经有二千一百四十多名流离失所的华侨乘坐祖国派来的第一批四艘轮船回国。
    今天登船的从苏甲武眉来的一批华侨，受到了在港口帮助他们的中华侨团总会工作人员和船上工作人员的热情接待和照顾。
    中国驻印度尼西亚大使黄镇和大使馆的人员以及中华侨团总会的代表们都到码头欢送他们。
    就像祖国派来的头三艘轮船一样，“海皇号”今天在一片欢呼声、热烈的掌声和爆竹声中，离开丹绒不碌港。
    登上“海皇号”轮船的华侨中，有三百二十多名来自尖美士和万悦地区。由于其他一些在排华活动中流离失所的华侨没有能够从他们的居住地区来到雅加达，他们在船上等了三天。但是这些天他们在船上过着非常愉快的生活。船上的工作人员举行了关于祖国的伟大变化的图片展览，祖国建设的飞跃发展使他们欢欣鼓舞。他们有的还组成小组学唱“歌唱祖国”等歌曲。
    尖美士和万悦地区曾经发生严重的排华活动，乘坐这艘船的许多华侨曾经被地方当局拘留了一个月甚至两个月，现在他们一心想着的，就是他们很快将要回到祖国温暖的怀抱。船上每个角落都充满着轻松愉快的气氛。
    今天，又有来自苏邦和加拉横的一千五百多名被迫迁移的华侨到达雅加达。他们将乘祖国派来的另两艘轮船“俄罗斯号”和“亚库契亚号”回返祖国。这两艘轮船预定明天达到这里。
