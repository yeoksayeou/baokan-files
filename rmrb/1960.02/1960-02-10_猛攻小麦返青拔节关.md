Editor's Note: Before the Spring Festival, the Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences sent people to parts of Henan and Jiangsu to investigate the growth of winter wheat, and based on the investigation, put forward opinions on the management of wheat fields in early spring. This is for reference by various regions.

At present, the growth of winter wheat throughout the country is generally characterized by sufficient seedlings, many tillers, good growth momentum, and a predominance of first and second-class seedlings with fewer third-class seedlings. According to incomplete surveys in major wheat-producing provinces such as Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hubei, Sichuan, and Jiangsu, first and second-class seedlings account for approximately 85% to 90%, while third-class seedlings account for only 10% to 15%, and even these are improved to varying degrees compared to the same type of seedlings in the same period last year. First and second-class wheat fields generally have 200,000 to 400,000 basic seedlings and 500,000 to 1,000,000 tillering seedlings per mu, with a few reaching over 1,200,000, and each plant has approximately two and a half to five tillers (including the main stem). Third-class fields have varying numbers of basic seedlings, generally growing relatively thin and small, mostly in the three-leaf stage, with a few having one tiller; tillering seedlings are mostly below 400,000 per mu, but have already produced tiller buds, concealed in the base of the stems and leaves. In some of the first and second-class seedlings, the distribution is uneven, the growth momentum is poor, and some even have yellowing of the first and second leaves at the base due to fertilizer deficiency, drought, or poor drainage.

Sufficient basic seedlings and tillering seedlings are the foundation of high wheat yields. According to the experience of 1958 and 1959: under field cultivation conditions, the effective tillering rate of wheat (including the main stem) is approximately 40%, with a higher tillering rate in the south and a lower rate in the north, a higher rate for spring varieties and a lower rate for winter varieties, and a higher rate for good fertilizer and water cultivation conditions and a lower rate for poor conditions. Under the current level of cultivation technology, if southern wheat fields have 400,000 large ears per mu and northern wheat fields reach 600,000 large ears per mu, then the certainty of obtaining high and stable yields is relatively high. If we require it to such a standard, then southern wheat fields must have one million tillers (including the main stem) per mu, and the north needs about one million two hundred thousand tillers per mu. At present, the number of basic seedlings is generally sufficient, but the number of tillering seedlings varies. Except for a few basic fields and high-yield plots, most of the first and second-class seedlings have not yet reached this number, and the third-class seedlings are even fewer. Therefore, starting from the goal of striving for comprehensive high yields, we must take all measures to form a new high tide of tillering during the overwintering and regreening periods, and on the basis of more tillers, process and cultivate them to promote vigorous growth of tillers and increase the effective tillering rate. This is the central link in the management of wheat fields this spring.

Fertilizer and Water as "Commanders" to Promote Tillering

Topdressing and irrigating (or draining) at the wheat regreening stage can not only consolidate the pre-year tillering of early wheat and promote the early spring tillering of late wheat, but also promote the robust growth of stems, promote the differentiation of young ears, and grow large ears. This is a critical moment for striving for more ears and larger ears. As the saying goes, "Three treasures for wheat harvest: many heads, large ears, and full grains." The key to determining the number of heads lies in the fertilizer, water conditions and management during the regreening period. Therefore, on the basis of applying winter fertilizer, a regreening fertilizer should be applied as early as possible. It is best to apply quick-acting fertilizers that can be quickly absorbed and utilized by wheat seedlings. If quick-acting fertilizers are insufficient, semi-quick or slow-acting fertilizers such as high-quality pig manure can also be applied. Although the fertilizer effect is slower, some nutrients are still absorbed by the wheat seedlings. Third-class seedlings should be mainly treated with heavy applications of human and animal manure or nitrogen chemical fertilizers; slow-acting fertilizers are best applied to first-class wheat fields, because these wheat seedlings have well-developed root systems and strong fertilizer absorption capacity, and the utilization rate of fertilizer is higher. In addition to nitrogen fertilizer, first-class seedlings should also pay attention to applying phosphorus and potassium fertilizer. For some first and second-class fields that already have yellowing due to lack of fertilizer, quick-acting fertilizers such as human and animal manure or ammonium sulfate should be applied immediately to promote recovery and catch up. No matter what type of seedling, whether it is slow-acting or quick-acting fertilizer, the application of regreening fertilizer is generally earlier, faster, and better. In terms of the amount of fertilizer applied, we must promote according to the condition of the seedlings, the fertilizer base, the source of fertilizer, and the nature of the fertilizer. In the north, general fields can be topdressed with about 10,000 jin of miscellaneous soil fertilizer or manure, or 10 to 20 jin of ammonium sulfate, about 200 jin of plant ash, or about 5,000 jin of kang soil or smoked fertilizer; in the south, general wheat fields can be applied with 25 to 30 dan of human and animal manure, or 50 to 70 dan of pig ash, or 10 to 15 jin of ammonium sulfate, or 10 to 20 jin of superphosphate.

The northern wheat area is often dry in early spring, and regreening water should be irrigated according to soil moisture conditions. Irrigation can promote the decomposition of winter and spring fertilizers, improve fertilizer efficiency, stabilize ground temperature, and prevent spring drought and spring freezing, which is important for promoting tiller growth. Generally, when the soil moisture in the root activity layer (calculated as 40 cm) in early spring is lower than 65% of the field's maximum water holding capacity (equivalent to a soil moisture content of 16-20%, depending on the soil quality), regreening water should be irrigated. If a large amount of coarse fertilizer is applied in winter or early spring, it should be combined with regreening water irrigation to achieve early, thorough, and even irrigation; even if the soil moisture is not very deficient during regreening, water should be irrigated as soon as possible in order to better exert the effect of fertilizer. Generally, 30 to 40 cubic meters of water are irrigated per mu, and first-class seedlings can be slightly smaller; if too much water is irrigated, the ground temperature will decrease, the soil aeration will be poor, and the growth of wheat seedlings will be slow, affecting the development of roots and the growth of tillers.

Conserve Moisture and Protect Seedlings

In northern early spring, drought is common. In wheat fields with poor soil preparation, there is severe wind and moisture loss, resulting in insufficient soil moisture near the tillering nodes, which affects the development of the root system and the normal growth of the above-ground parts. In low-lying areas and southern wheat areas, due to heavy rainfall, the soil moisture is high, which causes root pulling, frost damage, and freezing damage during the winter and spring thawing periods, especially in late-cropped wheat fields on heavy clay soils. In response to the specific conditions of different wheat areas, taking measures such as early spring harrowing, rolling, hoeing, and pressing, as well as tapping wheat to break the soil (i.e., tapping river mud) and earthing up the roots to process and manage can prevent frost and drought and promote wheat growth. In the past, some wheat fields in the north had the practice of early spring harrowing and rolling to conserve moisture or pressing wheat. Since 1958, various places have vigorously promoted gardenization and further promoted narrow-row close planting. The growth of wheat seedlings has been significantly improved compared with before, and the early spring harrowing and rolling measures should also be appropriately grasped according to specific conditions. We believe that: wheat fields with advanced gardenization can be combined with topdressing and irrigation during the regreening period, and small agricultural tools can be used to harrow the wheat and loosen the soil in the ridges in the fields, and animal-drawn toothed harrows should not be used for transverse or oblique harrowing of wheat to avoid damaging the specifications of the ridges; harrowing wheat has the best effect in general dry land, low-lying wet land, river beach land, or wheat fields with sufficient topsoil moisture in early spring where wheat seedling growth is not weak; alkaline land should be heavily harrowed; late and thin seedlings should not be harrowed. Wheat fields with a large amount of coarse manure as winter fertilizer or spring fertilizer should be harrowed and rolled as soon as possible to make the fertilizer fine and mixed evenly with the topsoil. Areas with the habit of hoeing wheat can replace harrowing with hoeing, or hoe and then harrow again; dry areas should be hoeed more often.

As for early spring pressing of wheat, whether it is early or late wheat, clay soil, loam soil, or flying sand soil, southern or northern, as long as the topsoil is not wet, pressing can be carried out to make the topsoil in close contact with the wheat roots, strengthen the activity of soil capillary water, and ensure that the tillering node soil layer has sufficient moisture and nutrients. After the soil is appropriately compacted, the soil's thermal conductivity is changed, and in the cold early spring, the heat of the subsoil can be conducted upward, increasing the topsoil temperature, which is conducive to early spring tiller growth and reducing spring frost damage. Generally, wheat fields should be hoeed and harrowed in time after pressing to loosen the soil and conserve moisture. Whether harrowing or pressing wheat should be done as early as possible, the later the effect, the smaller the effect.

Northern Widespread Irrigation of Jointing Water, Southern Clever Application of Jointing Fertilizer

From the regreening to the jointing stage, the stem growth cone gradually elongates, the young ears are differentiating, and the ineffective tillers begin to die. The fertilizer and water nutrient conditions during this period determine the number of tillers that become ears and the number of spikelets per ear; at the same time, it also greatly affects the number of florets and the perfection of floret differentiation. Experimental research and production practice consistently prove that timely and appropriate application of jointing fertilizer and irrigation of jointing water (in northern wheat areas) can significantly increase the tillering rate and grow large ears, which is another important key to high wheat yields. At this time, topdressing requires quick-acting fertilizer, such as human and animal manure, ammonium sulfate, superphosphate, plant ash, smoked fertilizer, and kang soil. In the northern wheat area, there is little spring rain, the soil moisture is not much, and the potential fertility is low, so the effect of fertilization is easy to grasp. Except for high-yield plots and experimental fields with particularly vigorous growth, a jointing fertilizer should generally be applied as widely as possible; in terms of the amount of fertilizer applied, generally 15 to 20 jin of ammonium sulfate or 1,000 to 2,000 jin of human and animal manure, or 200 to 300 jin of plant ash (the amount can be increased appropriately for high-yield plots) can be topdressed per mu. Third-class seedlings should be mainly treated with nitrogen fertilizer, while first-class seedlings should be treated with both phosphorus and potassium fertilizer.

The wheat area in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River has more spring rain, the soil moisture is abundant or excessive, and the potential soil fertility is high. When the wheat joints, the temperature has already risen. If topdressing is not appropriate, it is easy to form steep growth, lodging, greediness, and incomplete grain filling. In short, wheat field fertilization should be determined according to the specific conditions of soil, climate, seedlings, growth stage, variety, and fertilizer type, and should not be implemented mechanically. For general wheat fields, it is still necessary to appropriately topdress some quick-acting nitrogen fertilizer according to the condition of the seedlings before and after jointing from floret differentiation to the formation of stamens and pistils. Because wheat absorbs a lot of potassium from the rising to the jointing to the heading stage, quick-acting potassium fertilizer should be appropriately supplemented, especially in basic fields and high-yield plots with higher yield requirements and more nitrogen fertilizer applied.

The water demand of wheat gradually increases before and after jointing, and the water demand reaches its critical period during the booting stage. Water shortage during this period cannot form large ears with multiple grains. Therefore, in the spring drought areas of the north, jointing water must be irrigated widely. The timing and amount of irrigation mainly depend on the condition of the seedlings and the soil moisture.

There is more soil moisture in spring than in winter in the south, and wheat seedlings are easily damaged by moisture, so doing a good job of clearing ditches and draining water during early spring is as important as fertilization. Otherwise, if the soil moisture is too much or the groundwater level is too high, the wheat seedlings will be damaged by moisture, the leaf tips will turn yellow, the roots will turn brown, the growth will be slow, and the tillers will not grow, thus becoming thin, small, yellow, and weak. Ditch drainage in wheat fields can not only promote the development of wheat seedling roots, which is beneficial to the normal growth of the above-ground parts and the growth of ears and grain filling, but also improve soil ventilation, promote microbial activity, improve soil fertility, exert the effect of fertilization, inhibit the occurrence of pests and diseases (especially head blight), and increase the soil's water storage capacity to prevent sudden rainstorms from accumulating water and causing waterlogging.

Prevent and Control Diseases and Pests as Soon as Possible

Rust, head blight, and underground pests are the main threats to wheat production in China. We must be vigilant, strive for initiative, do a good job in surveying and forecasting, and strive to treat them early and thoroughly eliminate pests and diseases. According to winter seedling observation in Huaibei, Guanzhong, Henan and other places, rust has appeared sporadically in many places. Strengthen wheat field drainage to reduce soil moisture, and in rice-wheat double-cropping areas, pick up the rice stubble on the surface of the wheat field to minimize the source of head blight. During the early spring, underground pests harm wheat seedlings, which may cause missing seedlings and broken ridges. Apply 666 bait, poisonous grain, or poisonous powder as soon as possible to kill them.

    猛攻小麦返青拔节关
    中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所
    编者按：春节前，中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所派人在河南、江苏部分地区对冬小麦生长情况进行了调查，并根据调查提出早春麦田管理的意见。可供各地参考。
    目前，全国冬麦的生长情况，总的说来是苗数足，分蘖多，生长势好，一、二类苗多，三类苗少。据河北、河南、山东、山西、陕西、湖北、四川、江苏等主要产麦省不完全的调查，一、二类苗约占85％到90％，三类苗仅占10％到15％，而且比去年同时期的同类苗都有不同程度的提高。一、二类麦田一般有基本苗二十至四十万株，分蘖苗五十至一百万株，少数达到一百二十万株以上，单棵分蘖（包括主茎）约为二个半至五个。三类田基本苗数有多有少，一般生长比较瘦小，多在三叶期，少数有一个分蘖；分蘖苗多在四十万株以下，但已产生分蘖芽，包藏在茎叶基部。在一、二类苗中有部分麦苗分布不匀，生长势较差，有的还由于脱肥、受旱或者排水不良，而出现基部第一、二叶片发黄现象。
    足够的基本苗和分蘖苗是小麦丰产的基础。根据1958年和1959年的经验：在大田栽培条件下，小麦有效分蘖率（包括主茎在内）大约在40％上下，分蘖率南方较高、北方较低，春性品种较高、冬性品种较低，肥、水栽培条件好的较高、条件差的较低。在目前的栽培技术水平下，南方麦田每亩如有四十万个大穗、北方麦田达到六十万个大穗，那么获得高产稳收的把握是比较大的。如果按这样的标准来要求，则南方麦田每亩须拥有一百万个分蘖（包括主茎），北方每亩要有一百二十万个分蘖左右。目前，一般的基本苗数是够的，但是分蘖苗数则有多有少，除了少数的基本田和丰产方以外，大部分的一二类苗目前还达不到这个数量，至于三类苗那就更少了。所以，从争取全面丰产出发，必须采取一切措施，在越冬和返青期间形成一次新的分蘖高潮，并在多分蘖的基础上加工培育，促使分蘖健壮生长，提高有效分蘖率。这是今春麦田管理的中心环节。
    肥水为“帅”促进分蘖
    小麦返青时追肥、灌水（或排水），不仅能够巩固早麦的年前分蘖，促使晚麦的早春分蘖，同时还能促使茎生长粗壮，促进幼穗分化，长成大穗，这是争取穗多、穗大的紧要关头。农谚说“麦收三件宝，头多、穗大、籽粒饱”。而决定头多的关键，则在于返青期间的肥、水条件和管理情况。因此，必须在追施腊肥的基础上及早普施一次返青肥。最好施用速效肥料，能够迅速提供麦苗吸收利用。如果速效肥料不够，可兼施质量较好的猪厩肥等半速效或迟效肥料，尽管肥效较慢，仍有一部分养分为麦苗所吸收。三类苗以重施人粪尿或氮素化学肥料为主；迟效肥料则以施在一类麦田为好。因为这类麦苗根系发育好，吸肥能力强，对于肥料的利用率较高。一类苗除施用氮肥外还要注意加施磷钾肥。部分一、二类田目前已有缺肥发黄现象的，应即看苗追施人粪尿或硫酸铵等速效肥料，促使它恢复生长，迎头赶上。不论是哪一类苗，不管是迟效或速效肥料，施返青肥一般是越早、越快、越好。在施肥数量上，要根据苗情、施肥基础、肥源和肥料性质等看苗促进。在北方一般大田可追施土杂肥或厩肥一万斤左右，或硫酸铵十至二十斤、草木灰约二百斤，或炕土、熏肥五千斤上下；在南方一般麦田施用人粪尿二十五至三十担，或猪灰五十至七十担，或硫酸铵十至十五斤，或过磷酸钙十至二十斤。
    北方麦区早春多旱，应该根据墒情浇灌返青水。浇水能促使腊肥和春肥分解，提高肥效，并能稳定地温、防御春旱春冻，对于促进分蘖成长具有重要作用。一般早春根系活动层（按四十厘米算）土壤水分低于田间最大持水量的65％（相当于土壤含水量16—20％，因土质而异）时，就要浇返青水。如果冬季或早春施用了大量的粗肥，则应配合浇灌返青水，要做到浇早、浇透、浇匀；即便在返青时土壤水分并不很缺，但为了更好地发挥肥效，也应当及早浇水。一般每亩浇水三十至四十方，一类苗可以适量偏小些；浇水过多，地温降低，土壤通气不好，麦苗生长迟缓，影响根系发育和分蘖成长。
    保墒保苗
    北方早春干旱，在整地不好的麦田透风跑墒较严重，形成分蘖节附近土壤水分不足，影响根系发育和地上部分的正常生长。在低洼地区和南方麦区，由于雨水多，土壤湿度大，以致在冬春期间土壤结冻解冻引起根拔、凌截冻害，特别是粘重土壤上的晚茬麦田受害较重。针对不同麦区的具体情况，采取早春耙、耱、锄、镇压，以及敲麦碎土（即敲河泥）、壅根等措施加工管理，可以防止冻旱，促进小麦生育。北方部分麦田已往有早春顶凌耙耱保墒或压麦的做法。1958年以来，各地大搞园田化，进一步推行窄行密植，麦苗生长情况比以前显见提高，对于早春耙耱措施也要根据具体条件适当掌握。我们认为：高级园田化的麦田可结合返青期追肥浇水，采用小农具在畦内顺垅耙麦松土，不要使用畜力拉的钉齿耙进行横、斜耙麦，以免破坏畦田规格；麦苗生长不弱的一般旱地、低湿地、河滩地或早春表土水分较足的麦田，耙麦效果最好；碱地宜重耙；晚苗瘦小不宜耙。施用大量粗粪做腊肥或春肥的麦田要及早耙耱，使肥料细碎，并与表土掺合均匀。有锄麦习惯的地区可以以锄代耙，或锄后再耙一遍；干旱地区要多锄。
    至于早春压麦，无论早麦或晚麦，粘土、壤土或飞砂土，南方或北方，只要表土不湿，都可以进行镇压，使表土与麦根紧密接触，加强土壤毛细管水的活动，保证分蘖节土层有充足的水分与养分。土壤适当压实以后，改变了土壤导热性能，在寒冷的早春能将心土的热量向上导送，增高表土温度，有利于早春分蘖生长和减轻春季冻害。一般麦田压后宜适时锄耙，松土保墒。无论耙麦、压麦均以尽早进行为好，愈晚则效果愈小。
    北方普浇拔节水  南方巧施拔节肥
    返青至拔节阶段，茎生长锥逐渐伸长，幼穗正在分化，无效分蘖开始死亡，这一期间的肥、水营养条件决定分蘖成穗和每穗小穗数的多少；同时也在很大程度上影响小花数和小花分化的完善程度。试验研究和生产实践一致证明，适时适量追施拔节肥和浇灌拔节水（北方麦区），可以显著提高分蘖成穗率并长成大穗，这是小麦丰产的又一重要关键。这时追肥要求速效性肥料，以人粪屎、硫酸铵、过磷酸钙、草木灰、熏肥、炕土等为宜。北方麦区春雨少，土壤水分不多，潜在肥力较低，施肥效果容易掌握，除了生长特别旺茂的丰产方和试验田以外，一般应该尽量普施一次拔节肥；在施肥数量上，一般每亩可追硫酸铵十五至二十斤或人粪尿一千至二千斤，草木灰二百至三百斤（丰产方可酌增）。三类苗以施氮肥为主，一类苗兼施磷、钾肥。
    长江中下游麦区春雨较多，土壤水分充沛或过多，土壤潜在肥力较高，小麦拔节时气温已经上升，如果追肥不当，容易形成陡长、倒伏、贪青和籽粒不饱满等现象。总之，麦田施肥要看土、看气候、看苗、看生育阶段、看品种、看肥料种类等具体情况而定，不能机械执行。就一般麦田来说，在小花分化到雌雄蕊形成的拔节前后，看苗适当追施一些速效性氮肥还是必要的。由于小麦从起身拔节至抽穗期间吸收钾素很多，应该适当补施速效性钾肥，特别是在产量要求较高、施用氮肥较多的基本田和丰产方上。
    拔节前后小麦需水渐多，到孕穗期是其需水的临界期，这个时期缺水就不能形成大穗多粒。因此，在北方春旱地区必须普浇拔节水，浇水早晚和浇水数量主要看苗情和墒情而定。
    南方春季土壤水分比冬季多，麦苗容易受湿害，所以早春期间做好清沟排水和施肥同等重要。否则土壤水分过多，或地下水位过高，麦苗受到湿害，叶尖发黄，根部变褐，生长迟缓，分蘖不发，因而瘦小黄弱。麦田开沟排水除了促进麦苗根系发育，有利地上部分正常生长和长穗结实以外，还可以改善土壤通气条件，促进微生物活动，提高土壤肥力，发挥施肥效果，抑制病虫害的发生（特别是赤霉病）以及增加土壤蓄水能力，防止突然暴雨积水成涝。
    及早防病治虫
    锈病、赤霉病和地下害虫是我国小麦生产的主要威胁，必须提高警惕，争取主动，做好测报，争取治早治了，彻底消灭病虫害。根据在淮北、关中、河南等地冬季苗期观察，不少地方锈病已经零星出现。加强麦田排水工作，降低土壤湿度，以及在稻麦两熟地区，拾净麦田表面的稻桩，尽量减少赤霉病的菌源。早春期间地下害虫为害麦苗，可能造成缺苗断垅，应及早撒施六六六毒饵、毒谷或毒粉杀灭。
