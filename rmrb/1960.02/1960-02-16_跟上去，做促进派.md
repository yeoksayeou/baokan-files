    Keep Up and Be a Promoter
    Kong Sang
    A distinct characteristic of the current technical innovation and technical revolution movement is the speed formed by its broad mass character. Take the news reported in the newspapers these past two days: the four industries of Hangzhou—iron, wood, bamboo, and clothing—including more than 300 factories and cooperatives with over 20,000 workers, basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization in a short half-month. In Shenyang's clothing industry, the history of using foot-pedal sewing machines was ended in twelve days for more than 1,500 machines. Tianjin, a large industrial city, increased the level of mechanization in intra-factory transportation from 1% to 10% to 80% to 100% in just over a month. County-run enterprises, with relatively poor technical conditions, saw more than 300 county-run enterprises in the Jinan Prefecture of Shanxi Province raise their level of mechanization and semi-mechanization from about 30% to 76% in fifty days. What speed this is! The development of productive forces is so rapid, and the creative wisdom of the masses bursts forth with such astonishing power, fully proving the boundless brilliance of the General Line for Socialist Construction and the tremendous significance of putting politics in command and liberating thought.
    This vigorous and thriving situation cannot help but evoke memories of the unforgettable year of 1958. That year was the year the General Line was put forward, the year the great liberation of thought began, the year productive forces surged forward at an unprecedented rate, and the year production relations underwent drastic changes. In the industrial sector, the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," along with the large-scale destruction and establishment of various rules and regulations, can be said to have implemented a great transformation in the relationships between people—mainly in the mutual relationships during labor. Practice has proven that without this transformation of production relations and the change in the mental outlook of the people, the continuous Great Leap Forward in production in 1958 and 1959 would not have been possible.
    Now, we are again faced with a situation of rapid advancement of productive forces, and this time it is a new development based on more favorable political and ideological conditions, a stronger economic and technical foundation, and more abundant experience. Under these circumstances, certain aspects of production relations also need to keep pace, that is, corresponding developments are needed in management systems, leadership methods, and labor organization. Without this, it will be impossible to ensure that the vigorous productive forces advance smoothly and powerfully.
    The technical personnel and management personnel in the departments of the Chongqing Radio Factory changed their management work, went deep into production, and played the role of promoting production. They closely followed the movement. When workers put forward innovation suggestions, they quickly promoted their realization; when workers needed tools and materials, they quickly found them and delivered them to the workshops; when workers rapidly changed the face of production, they also quickly revised the rules and regulations accordingly; when workers improved efficiency, they adjusted the quotas in a timely manner. The department personnel, who control the management work—one of the production relations in the enterprise—use such steps to make production relations closely follow the advancement of productive forces. Obviously, in such enterprises, the development of the technical innovation movement will surely be unstoppable, progressing rapidly, and its speed will be difficult to estimate. Therefore, all technical personnel and management personnel in all enterprises and units must see the rapid development of productive forces brought about by the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, and actively change the relevant management work, rules and regulations, and adjust labor organization; this will enable productive forces to make significant leaps forward and play a promoting role in the development of production.

    跟上去，做促进派

    当前技术革新和技术革命运动的一个鲜明的特色是广泛的群众性所形成的快。就拿这两天报上登的消息来看吧：杭州的铁、木、竹、服装等四个行业，包括三百多个厂、社两万多个职工，在短短的半个月里，就基本上实现了机械化和半机械化。沈阳的服装业，一千五百多台缝纫机，十二天就结束了用脚踏的历史。天津这个大工业城市，在一个多月的时间里，竟把全市的厂内运输的机械化程度从1％到10％提高到了80％到100％。县营企业，技术条件是比较差的，但是山西晋南专区的三百多个县营企业，五十天就把机械化、半机械化程度从30％左右提高到了76％。这是何等的速度！生产力的发展会如此迅猛，群众的创造智慧会迸发出这样惊人的力量，完全证明了社会主义建设总路线的光芒万丈，政治挂帅、思想解放的巨大意义。
    这种如火如荼的形势，令人不由得联想起了难忘的1958年。那一年，是总路线提出的一年，是思想大解放开始的一年，也是生产力以空前的速度迅猛突进的一年，也是生产关系激烈变化的一年。从工业部门来说，“两参一改三结合”，对各种规章制度的大破大立，等等，可以说在人和人的关系上——主要是劳动中的相互关系上，实行了一次伟大的变革。实践证明，如果没有这种生产关系的变革和人们精神面貌的改变，1958年和1959年的生产是不会这样连续大跃进的。
    现在，我们又面临着一个生产力迅猛突进的形势，而且这一次是在政治、思想条件更为有利，经济、技术基础更为强大，经验更为丰富的基础上的新发展。在这种情况下，生产关系的某些方面也需要跟着前进，也就是在管理制度、领导方法、劳动组织等方面需要有相应的发展。不如此，就不可能保证蓬蓬勃勃的生产力畅通无阻地浩浩荡荡地前进。
    重庆无线电厂的科室技术人员和管理人员，改变了管理工作，深入生产，起了发展生产的促进派的作用。他们紧紧地跟着运动走。工人们提出了革新建议，他们尽快地促其实现；工人们需要工具、材料，他们尽快地找来送到车间；工人们迅速地改变着生产面貌，他们也迅速地相应地修订规章制度；工人们提高了工效，他们就适时地修改定额。掌握着管理工作——企业里生产关系之一的科室人员，用这样的步伐来使生产关系紧紧跟随着生产力前进。显然，在这样的企业里，技术革新运动的发展一定会势如破竹，一日千里，难于估量其速度了。因此，一切企业单位的技术人员和管理工作人员，都要看到技术革新和技术革命的广大群众运动所带来的生产力的迅猛发展，主动地改变有关的管理工作、规章制度，以及调整劳动组织；这将会使生产力得到长足的猛进，而对发展生产起到促进派的作用。
