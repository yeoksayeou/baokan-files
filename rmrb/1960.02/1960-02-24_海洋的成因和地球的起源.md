Editor's Note: Since the publication of "Marine Geology and its Main Problems" in this newspaper on November 2, 1959, some readers have requested explanations of the origin of the oceans and the origin of the Earth, as well as introductions to the nebular hypothesis of Kant-Laplace and the solar system origin theory of Soviet academician Schmidt. The following is the response of Comrade Liang Yuanbo, the author of the aforementioned article, to these questions.

Since ancient times, many thinkers have attempted to explain such fundamental mysteries as: How did the vast ocean form? Where did the Earth we stand on come from? In the past, people could only rely on imagination and legends to answer these questions, but now, with the development of science, these questions can be gradually approached and solved.

From Darwin's Pacific Origin Hypothesis to the Kant-Laplace Nebular Hypothesis

Many people, upon seeing the name Darwin, probably think of the great scientist who laid the materialist foundation for biology, but we are talking about his son here, not him.

Old Darwin's son, George Darwin Jr., was also a scientist, and he considered the problem of the Pacific's origin early on. After observing tidal forces in the sea and perturbations between celestial bodies, he put forward a very interesting hypothesis. Darwin Jr. believed that in the early stages of the Earth's formation, the Earth's matter was still in a state of incandescent melting, and the Earth's rotation speed was much faster than it is now, with the Earth completing one rotation in just three to four hours. Due to the rapid rotation, the Earth became slightly bulged towards the equator and slightly flattened at the poles, like Jupiter today. As it continued to rotate, the Earth became like an egg, and then like a pear. Finally, the protruding "pear head" was separated from the Earth by the gravitational force of the sun, becoming a satellite orbiting the Earth – the Moon, while the part of the Earth that was peeled off formed a depression or gap, giving rise to the Pacific Ocean.

An astronomer named Pickering, based on Darwin Jr.'s hypothesis, called the Pacific Ocean "the wound left by the Moon's departure." Later, this hypothesis continued to develop. Some geologists speculated that after the Moon separated from the Earth, the remaining part of the Earth's crust "slid" towards the depression to fill the gap in the Pacific Ocean from the east and west, resulting in huge tension in the crust. Finally, in the Jurassic period, this piece of crust was torn apart, forming two continents drifting in opposite directions. The eastern one was larger, namely Eurasia and Africa, and the western one was smaller, forming North and South America, while the rift in between was the Atlantic Ocean.

If you open a map and take a look, you can see that the outlines of the east and west coasts of the Atlantic Ocean are somewhat similar, with the protrusions on the east side facing the indentations on the west side. In addition, on the American continent, the mountains are concentrated on the west side, as if the western edge of the continental block encountered resistance and was squeezed and folded when it moved towards the Pacific Ocean. The end of South America, in Argentina and Chile, curves eastward by several degrees, just as it would if the land had encountered resistance while drifting westward.

This is the famous Wegener's theory of continental drift in marine geology. It was proposed relatively completely by the German geophysicist Alfred Wegener and Köppen. They even calculated the speed at which the Americas were advancing towards the Pacific Ocean as eleven meters per year, based on changes in the longitude of New York.

Unfortunately, these rather interesting hypotheses do not conform to the facts of historical geology and historical oceanography accumulated in recent years. We now know that many areas of the Pacific Ocean are constantly sinking, while other areas are undergoing orogenic movements. The Pacific Ocean is a primary crustal area, and there has never been a continent on it. Moreover, according to recent calculations, the mass of the Moon does not match the mass lost from the Pacific Ocean gap. If you were to put the Moon into the Pacific Ocean, then the Moon would protrude a lot from the Pacific Ocean. There is also the problem of angular momentum that cannot be solved. So now probably no one will support Darwin Jr.'s hypothesis anymore.

The situation in the Atlantic Ocean is similar. Recent studies of marine geological structures (such as O.K. Leontiev, 1955) have proven that the central part of the Atlantic Ocean is a modern orogenic zone, and the two sides of the Atlantic Ocean also have fault-generated origins. This casts doubt on the "tearing" theory.

It should be pointed out that an important point is that both hypotheses start from the premise that the Earth was once in a molten state. Their ideological foundation is the Kant-Laplace view of cosmic genesis. According to a famous hypothesis put forward by the German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) and the French mathematician and astronomer Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749-1827) in the second half of the eighteenth century, the Earth and other planets were formed as follows: In the early days, there was a hot nebula in cosmic space, which constantly contracted and rotated due to its own gravity. Finally, the speed of matter at the equator of the nebula exceeded a certain critical value, at which point the centrifugal force of the matter was greater than the gravitational force of the nebula's body on it, and the matter at the equator of the nebula separated, forming a gas ring similar to the rings of Saturn. This gas ring gradually contracted and condensed, forming a planet. This process was repeated, resulting in the ten planets of the solar system (one of which was later torn apart and split into asteroids), while the remaining nebula body contracted into the current sun. This hypothesis dominated the scientific community for a long time. Because it conceives the problem very simply and completely, people call it the classical theory of the origin of the solar system.

Unfortunately, this rather interesting Kant-Laplace nebular hypothesis does not conform to the facts proven by modern scientific research. For example, according to this theory, the Earth was separated from the sun, and it gradually cooled and contracted from a hot state. Although the Earth's surface has now cooled and solidified, the central part should still have temperatures of tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of degrees, and so on. Some Western geologists have even put forward the fallacy of a so-called gaseous core based on this hypothesis. They believe that physical research has determined that any substance has a critical point. When the temperature of the substance is above this critical point, no matter how much pressure is applied, the substance cannot be transformed into a liquid or solid state. Since the temperature of the Earth's core is so high, then the matter in the core must undoubtedly be in a gaseous state. We can only laugh at such "theories."

Modern scientific developments have gradually broken the superstition of the Kant-Laplace hypothesis. For example, the problem of angular momentum distribution in the solar system, put forward by modern celestial mechanics, cannot be explained by the Kant-Laplace hypothesis in any way. The sun's body accounts for more than 99.87% of the total mass of the solar system, but its angular momentum only accounts for 1-2%, which is a huge contradiction, indicating that the sun and planets could not have been produced by a single entity. Secondly, more and more facts have been found in geology that contradict the theory that the Earth expands from heat to cold. The accumulation of these facts has made people doubt the correctness of the Kant-Laplace hypothesis's explanation of the Earth's origin. In marine geology, we have briefly discussed some of these facts above.

After that, many Westerners put forward other hypotheses for the formation of the solar system, such as the Chamberlin-Moulton planetesimal hypothesis, the Jeans hypothesis, the Jeffreys hypothesis, and the Russell hypothesis, etc., but none of them could get rid of a fatal flaw – detachment from reality. Therefore, all these hypotheses are essentially idealistic.

A crisis then emerged. Reflected in marine geology, a "perfect" Darwin Jr.-Wegener system ran into a nail in the face of facts, and marine geologists had no new theory to explain all these phenomena. At such a critical juncture, some bourgeois scholars ran out. For example, a bourgeois scholar named Rodian Green said that the Earth is probably not a sphere, but a tetrahedron, with its four corners exposed on the water surface, forming the continents. You see, aren't several continents such as North and South America and Africa triangular? The faces of this tetrahedron form the oceans, and it happens to have four: the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean. This is the so-called "tetrahedral hypothesis" of ocean origin. Later, others ran out and said: How were many other large seas, such as the Mediterranean Sea, formed? Perhaps the Earth is not a tetrahedron, but a dodecahedron! Thus, another "dodecahedral hypothesis" appeared, its "creator" being the bourgeois scholar Élie de Beaumont.

There are many other such so-called theories. I don't think it is necessary to say more. These things are so ridiculous that no one will be fooled by them!

Academicians Schmidt's theory of the origin of the solar system

In 1946, O.Yu. Schmidt, Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, put forward a materialist and rational theory of the origin of the solar system based on the large amount of facts accumulated to date and precise mathematical calculations. Academician Schmidt's theory absorbs the rational core of the Kant-Laplace hypothesis (that is, the evolution of the solar system is a natural development result without external interference) and abandons all accidental and idealistic things. It marks a new stage in the development of the theory of cosmic evolution.

Academician Schmidt's theory holds that the sun and the planets of the solar system have different origins. The central idea of the theory is the capture of nebular matter by stars. According to Academician Schmidt, the sun was not much different from what it is now tens of billions of years ago (astrophysical research confirms this). On its journey, it encountered a diffuse nebula material distributed within the Milky Way. When the sun passed through this nebula, its rotation drove the surrounding gas-dust particles, causing them to rotate with it. The sun drove more and more matter on its long journey. When it came out of the nebula, it captured a large cloud of gas and dust around it due to gravity. The particles of these substances were still moving. They collided with each other, gradually reducing the speed of their movement, and gradually moving in accordance with a basic direction – that is, the direction of the sun's rotation. Later, under the action of gravity, smaller particles adhered to larger particles, forming some condensation nuclei. These condensation nuclei attracted more and more matter, gradually growing and forming planets, one of which is our Earth. According to the law of averaging the moment of momentum, the orbits of these planets gradually approached a circle, and due to the relationship of gravitational equilibrium, the orbits of these planets were roughly distributed according to Bode's law. Orbits that violate these laws cannot exist and are gradually eliminated or incorporated into planetary orbits. In 1956, the famous Soviet scientist Fesenkov believed that when planets were generated, satellites – such as the moon – were also generated. This formed the existing solar system.

In addition, other scientists pointed out that at the beginning of the Earth's formation, the Earth's matter was not very tightly gathered. At this time, various substances were differentiated according to weight or according to the so-called atomic volume. The so-called siderophile elements (iron, nickel, platinum group elements) with the smallest atomic volume were "sieved" down to form the Earth's nickel-iron core – that is, what geologists call the nickel-iron sphere. Above it is a sulfide sphere, gathering various chalcophile elements with larger atomic volumes. Above it is a geosphere containing elements such as silicon, magnesium, and aluminum. The uppermost layer is the hydrosphere (including our ocean) and the atmosphere, where the atoms have the largest atomic volume.

The Earth was initially "cold," that is, it had the temperature of ordinary dark nebulae, and its volume was relatively small (this has been fully demonstrated by Soviet paleogeographers). Later, with the fission and decomposition of radioactive elements such as thorium, radium, and actinium in the Earth's crust, the Earth's crust began to gradually heat up. Finally, on the heavier and denser lower crust (the so-called sima layer, whose constituent substances are mainly basic magnesium-iron silicates), lighter and less dense sialic layer substances were gradually segregated out. This is the granite continent where we live. However, the accumulation of radioactive elements and the segregation of granite continents did not proceed evenly in the Earth's crust; some places proceeded quickly, and some places proceeded slowly. Some places have not even been touched at all and are still bare, exposing the heavier and denser underlying bedrock. For example, the Pacific Ocean is such an area, and the sialic layer has not been segregated out on it. In recent years, studies using various geophysical methods such as gravity prospecting and seismic wave observation have fully confirmed that the density of the Pacific Ocean floor is much greater than that of the continental rock layer (about 3.2:2.75), and its rock composition is also different.

In 1957, Soviet scholar Professor K.K. Markov believed that the Earth is still in the first third of its development, based on the fact that granite continents currently account for only one-third of the Earth's surface. He also pointed out that granite continents have been growing towards the oceans throughout the entire geological history. The gradual subsidence of the Pacific Ocean floor is due to the "flow" of ocean floor material towards the continental base under the isostatic equilibrium of the Earth's crust, to compensate for the mass loss after the bottom material segregates the sialic layer. The general trend of the Earth's development is towards increasing volume and constantly replenishing energy. The opinions that the Earth has aged, that the original heat is about to be exhausted, that the Earth's surface is constantly shrinking, and that organisms will become extinct due to the exhaustion of the Earth's own energy are completely unfounded.

Thus, we return to the question of the origin of land and sea. We now know that the Pacific Ocean has primary properties, while other oceans are either due to the insufficient formation of the sialic granite continent or due to the subsidence of the ocean floor. As for the seas on the continental margins and between continents, they are mainly formed by marine transgressions and have secondary geological structural origins. They generally took shape at the end of the Tertiary Period and developed and completed in the Quaternary Period.

Since Academician Schmidt put forward his theory, a series of geological departments have gradually formed a new theoretical system in the past ten years. For example, paleogeography has achieved great research results on the basis of this theory. This is an achievement of the Soviet scientific and ideological community, and it is a victory for dialectical materialism in natural science. We must better learn from the advanced scientific basic theories of the Soviet Union, and strive to establish a materialist and correct marine geology theoretical system, to better master the laws of nature and transform nature.

    海洋的成因和地球的起源
    中国科学院广州分院南海海洋研究所　梁元博
    编者按　自1959年11月2日本报发表“海洋地质学及其主要问题”一文后，有读者要求解释海洋的成因及地球的起源，介绍从康德——拉普拉斯的星云假说到苏联学者施密特院士的太阳系起源学说。下面是该文作者梁元博同志对上述问题的答复。
    自古以来，有不少的思想家企图解释这样一些根本性质的谜：那苍茫的大海，是怎样形成的？我们立足的大地，又是从哪里来的？从前的人对这些问题的解答，只能寄托于想像和传说，而现在随着科学的发展，这些问题已经可以逐渐接近解决了。
    从达尔文太平洋成因假说到康德—拉普拉斯的星云假说
    许多人看到达尔文这个名字，大约总要想起那位给生物学奠定了唯物主义基础的伟大科学家，可是我们在这里谈的不是他，而是他的儿子。
    老达尔文的儿子，小乔治·达尔文也是一位科学家，他很早就考虑过太平洋成因的问题。他观察了海中的潮汐作用和星体之间的摄动后，提出了一个很有趣的假说。小达尔文认为，在地球形成之初，地球的物质还处在炽热的熔融状态，那时地球的自转速度也比现在快得多，地球自转一周只需三至四小时；由于旋转得快，地球变得稍为向赤道方面膨起，两极方面稍呈扁平状，就像现在的木星那样。以后继续旋转下去，地球就变成了一个鸡蛋的样子，以后又变成一个梨子似的，最后，突出的那一部分“梨头”受太阳的引力作用从地球分离了出去，成为环绕地球旋转的卫星——月球，而地球上被剥离了的部分形成一个洼地或缺口，产生了太平洋。
    有一个天文学家毕克林根据小达尔文的这种假说，把太平洋叫做“月球脱离时留下的创伤”。以后，这个假说就继续发展起来了。一些地质学家推测，在月球从地球分离以后，地壳剩余下来的部分，就向洼地方面“滑动”，从东西两面来填补太平洋这个缺口，结果在地壳中产生了巨大的张力。终于，在侏罗纪时把这一块地壳扯裂了，形成了各奔东西的两块大陆。东面的这一块比较大，就是欧亚大陆和非洲，西面分出去的一块比较小，形成了南北美洲，而当中的裂缝就是大西洋。
    如果大家打开地图看看，可以看到大西洋东西两岸的轮廓有点相似，东边凸出来的地方对着西边凹进去的地方；此外，在美洲大陆那边，山脉都集中在西面，好像是大陆块向太平洋那边移动时西面的边缘遇到阻力而给挤压、皱了起来似的。南美洲的末端在阿根廷和智利的地方向东有若干度数的弯曲，也正像是陆地向西漂移时遇到阻力而出现的情形一样。
    这就是在海洋地质学上很有名的所谓魏格纳大陆漂移学说。它是由德国地球物理学家魏格纳和科宾比较完整地提出来的。他们甚至还根据纽约的经度变化，算出美洲向太平洋推进的速度是每年十一米。
    可惜，这些相当有趣的假说并不符合近年来积累到的地史学和历史海洋学的事实。现在我们知道，太平洋有许多区域正在不断下沉，另一些区域正在产生造山作用。太平洋是一个原生的地壳区，它上面从来也没有大陆存在过，而且根据近年的计算，月球的质量并不符合太平洋这个缺口失去的质量。如果把月球按到太平洋里去，那末月球要从太平洋里冒出来很多。还有一个角动量的问题也不能解决。所以现在大约不会再有人支持小达尔文的假说了。
    大西洋方面的情形也相似。近年对海洋地质构造的研究（如O·K·列昂节夫，1955），证明了大西洋中央部分是一个现代的造山作用区，而大西洋两岸也具有断层成因。这就给“撕裂”学说打上一个问号。
    应该指出很重要的一点，即这两个假说都是以地球从前曾经处于熔融状态这一点来出发的。它们的思想基础是康德——拉普拉斯的宇宙成因见解。根据德国哲学家康德（1724—1804）和法国数学家和天文学家拉普拉斯（1749—1827）在十八世纪下半叶提出的一个著名的假说，地球和其他行星是这样生成的：原始时候在宇宙空间存在着一团炽热的星云，它由于本身的重力作用而不断收缩和旋转，最后，星云赤道上的物质运动速度超过了某一临界数值，这时物质的离心力大于星云本体对它的引力，星云赤道上的物质就分离出来，形成类似于土星环那样的一个气体环。这个气体环逐渐收缩和凝聚起来，形成一个行星。这种作用一再发生，结果生成了太阳系的十大行星（有一个后来给扯碎了分裂成小行星），而残余的星云本体则收缩成现在的太阳。这个假说统治了科学界很久。由于它把问题设想得很简单和很完整，所以人们把它称为古典的太阳系起源论。
    可惜，这个相当有趣的康德—拉普拉斯星云假说并不符合现代科学研究所证明的事实。例如，根据这个学说，地球是从太阳分离出来的，它从炽热状态逐渐冷却和收缩，地球现在表面虽然冷却和凝固了，中心部分仍应有着几万度以至十几万度的高温，等等。有些西方的地质学家根据这个假说甚至还提出了所谓气体地核的谬论。他们认为，物理学的研究确定了任何物质都有一个临界点，物质的温度在这个临界点以上时，不论用多大的压力都不能使这种物质转变为液态和固态，地球核心部分的温度既然如此之高，那末核心部分的物质必呈气态无疑了。对于这样的“理论”，我们只能置之一笑。
    现代的科学发展逐渐打破了对康德—拉普拉斯假说的迷信。例如，现代天体力学提出的太阳系角动量分配问题，是康德—拉普拉斯假说无论如何不能解释的：太阳本体占有太阳系总质量的99．87％以上，而其角动量却只占1—2％，这是一个极大的矛盾，说明太阳和行星不可能由一个整体所产生。其次，在地质学方面查明了愈来愈多的事实，同地球由热胀到冷缩的说法相抵触，这些事实积累起来，就使人怀疑康德—拉普拉斯假说对地球成因解释的正确性。在海洋地质学方面，这些事实我们在上面已经略为谈过一些了。
    此后，西方许多人提出了另外的太阳系形成假说，如所谓张伯林—马尔顿微星假说，金斯假说，杰弗里斯假说和罗素假说等等，也没有能摆脱一个致命的缺点，——脱离事实，所以这一切假说实质上都是唯心主义。
    这时就出现了危机。反映在海洋地质学上的是，“好端端”的一个小达尔文—魏格纳体系在事实面前碰到了钉子，而海洋地质学家们又没有新的学说来解释这一切现象。在这样一个关头面前，一些资产阶级学者就跑出来了。例如，有一个叫做罗迪安·格林的资产阶级学者说，地球大概不是一个球体吧，它准是一个四面体，它的四个角尖儿露出在水面上，形成了大陆。你们看，南北美洲、非洲等几个大陆不都是呈三角形的吗？这个四面体的面形成了大洋，它恰好有四个：太平洋、大西洋、印度洋、北冰洋。这就是海洋起源方面的所谓“四面体假说”。后来又有另外一些人跑出来说：其他还有许多大的海，如地中海，又是怎样生成的呢？大概地球不是一个四面体，而是一个十二面体吧！这样又出现了一个“十二面体假说”，它的“创造者”是资产阶级学者埃利·特波蒙。
    还有许多这一类的所谓理论，我想是不必多说了。这些东西是这样可笑，总不会有人上它的当吧！
              施密特院士的太阳系起源学说
    1946年，苏联科学院院士O·IO·施密特根据目前积累到的大量事实和精密的数学计算，提出了一个唯物主义的合理的太阳系起源学说。施密特院士的学说吸收了康德—拉普拉斯假说的合理内核（即认为太阳系的演化是不由外力干预的自然发展结果），扬弃了一切带偶然性的和唯心主义的东西。它标志着宇宙演化论发展的新阶段。
    施密特院士的学说认为，太阳和太阳系的行星具有不同的成因。学说的中心思想是恒星对星云物质的俘获。根据施密特院士的意见，在几十亿年前，太阳和现在所见的并没有太大的变化（天体物理学的研究证实了这点）。它在自己的运行途中和一团分布在银河系内的弥漫星云物质遭遇上了。当太阳通过这团星云的时候，它的自转带动了周围的气体——尘埃质点，使之随着自身转动起来。太阳在漫长的运行途中带动了愈来愈多的物质。当它从星云里出来的时候，由于万有引力的关系，在它周围就俘获了一大团气体尘埃。这些物质的质点仍然在运动着，它们彼此碰撞，逐渐减低了运动的速度，并且逐渐依照着一个基本的方向——即太阳自转的方向——来运转。以后在引力的作用下，较小的质点粘附到较大的质点上来，形成了一些凝聚核心。这些凝聚核心又吸引住愈来愈多的物质，逐渐增长起来，形成了行星，其中一个就是我们的地球。按照动量矩的平均化法则，这些行星的轨道渐渐接近于圆形，又由于引力平衡的关系，这些行星的轨道大致上依照波特定律来分布。违反这些定律的轨道不能存在，逐渐被淘汰或归并到行星轨道上去。1956年苏联著名科学家费森科夫院士认为，在生成行星的时候，也同时生成了卫星——如月球等等。这样就形成了现存的太阳系。
    此外，别的科学家指出，在地球形成之初，地球物质的聚集并不是很紧密的。这时各种物质就按照重量或者按照所谓原子体积产生分异作用，具有最小原子体积的所谓亲铁元素（铁，镍，铂族元素）给“筛”到下面去，组成了地球的镍铁核心——即地质学家所谓的镍铁圈；上面一点是聚集着原子体积比较大的各种亲硫元素，形成了一个硫化物圈。再上面是一个含有硅、镁、铝等元素的地圈；最上面是水圈（包括我们的海洋）和大气圈，这里的原子具有最大的原子体积。
    地球起初是“冷”的，即具有普通的暗黑星云的温度，并且体积比较小（这点已由苏联古地理学家充分论证）。以后随着钍、镭、锕等放射性元素在地壳里的裂变分解，地壳开始逐渐变热起来。最后，在较重和密度较大的下层地壳上（即所谓硅镁层，其组成物质以基性的镁铁硅酸盐为主），逐渐分凝出较轻和密度较小的硅铝层物质来。这上面就是我们所居住的花岗岩大陆。但是放射性元素的聚积和花岗岩大陆的分凝作用在地壳中进行得并不均匀，有的地方进行得快，有的地方进行得慢。某些地方目前甚至完全没有触动过，仍然是裸露出较重和密度较大的底层基岩，例如太平洋就是这样的一个区域，它上面还没有分凝出硅铝层来。近年来用各种地球物理学方法如重力探测和地震波观测等方法所作的研究，完全证实了太平洋底的密度比大陆岩层的密度大得多（约为3．2∶2．75），其岩石组成也不相同。
    1957年苏联学者K·K·马尔科夫教授根据目前花岗岩大陆仅占地球表面三分之一这一点，认为地球还处在它本身发育的前三分之一阶段，并且指出花岗岩大陆在整个地史时期内是向大洋方面增长的。而太平洋底的逐渐沉降，则是由于洋底物质在地壳均衡作用下“流”向大陆基底，以补偿底层物质分凝出硅铝层后质量亏损的原故。地球发育的总趋势是向体积增大和能量不断得到补给的方向进行；那些认为地球已经衰老，原始热量即将耗尽，地表在不断皱缩和生物因地球本身能量的耗尽而将绝灭的意见，是完全没有根据的。
    这样，我们又回到海陆成因的问题上来了。现在我们知道，太平洋具有原生的性质，而其他几个大洋，或者是由于硅铝层花岗岩大陆还没有充分形成，或者是由于洋底沉降而产生的。至于大陆边缘和大陆之间的海，则主要是由海侵形成和具有次级的地质构造成因，它们一般是在第三纪末初具规模，而在第四纪内发育完成的。
    自施密特院士提出他的学说以来，在最近的十几年间有一系列的地学部门已经逐渐形成了一个新的理论体系，例如，古地理学在这个学说的基础上已经得到了很大的研究成果。这是苏联科学界和思想界的成就，是辩证唯物主义思想在自然科学方面的胜利。我们一定要更好地向苏联先进的科学基础理论学习，为建立唯物主义的、正确的海洋地质学理论体系，为更好地掌握自然规律和改造自然而斗争。
