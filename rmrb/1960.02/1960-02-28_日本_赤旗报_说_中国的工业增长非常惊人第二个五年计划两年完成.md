    Japanese "Akahata" Reports:
    China's Industrial Growth is Astonishing; Second Five-Year Plan Completed in Two Years
    According to the actual achievements of 1959, China's State Statistical Bureau officially announced that the Second Five-Year Plan was completed in only two years. According to the State Statistical Bureau, the total value of industrial and agricultural output increased by 31.1%, greatly exceeding the adjusted target of 20% proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee. The target set for the last year of the Second Five-Year Plan was to increase by 75% compared to 1957, but last year's achievements greatly exceeded this figure, increasing by 94.4%. Among them, the industrial growth was astonishing, with the original plan being an increase of 25.6% compared to 1958, while the actual achievement was an increase of 39.3%; according to the plan, agriculture would increase by 10% compared to 1958, but it achieved an increase of 16.7%. If one considers that more than one-third of the total cultivated land area was hit by natural disasters unseen in decades last year, this can be said to be a very great achievement. It is believed that the increase in the total value of agricultural output is mainly due to the increased production from the diversified operations of the People's Communes.

    日本“赤旗报”说
    中国的工业增长非常惊人第二个五年计划两年完成
    中国国家统计局根据1959年的实际成绩，正式宣布第二个五年计划只用两年的时间就完成了。根据国家统计局的统计，工农业总产值增长31．1％，大大地超过了中共八中全会提出要增长20％的调整指标。第二个五年计划规定的最后一年的指标要比1957年增长75％，可是去年的成绩却大大地超过了这个数字，增长了94．4％。其中，工业的增长是非常惊人的，原定计划是比1958年增长25．6％，而实际成绩是增长39．3％；按计划，农业比1958年增长10％，但却取得了增长16．7％的成绩，如果想想占全部耕地面积的三分之一以上的土地去年受到了几十年来的自然灾害的袭击的话，这可以说是非常大的成绩。人们认为，农业总产值的增长主要是由于人民公社的多种经营的增产。
