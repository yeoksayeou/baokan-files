Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd - According to TASS, Paris, February 20th: The French newspaper "l'Humanité" published a statement by Ali Yata, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Moroccan Communist Party, regarding the recent decision by the Moroccan Court of Appeal to ban the activities of the Moroccan Communist Party.

Yata said that the masterminds of this judicial persecution could not find any flaws in our policies and our activities, because our policies and our activities are determined by the interests of the working class, the people, and the nation. The pretexts they use to attack are completely non-existent, they are imposed on us, and they oppose the Marxist-Leninist theory we follow. They want to use this method to eliminate the Moroccan Communist Party.

Yata continued, the Court of Appeal's decision goes against the wishes of the people and violates the democratic constitutional provisions. This decision creates a precedent, and any political party, group, and patriot in our country will not ignore the danger of this precedent.

Yata said that we can say with certainty that this decision has aroused public outrage, and the people have expressed sympathy for the Moroccan Communist Party.

Yata pointed out that the Communist Party leadership is prepared to take all legal means, first and foremost, to appeal. He said that the Court of Appeal's decision cannot change the beliefs of Moroccan Communists. Moroccan Communists will continue, as always, to tirelessly serve the Moroccan people and the country.

    摩共第一书记发表谈话说
    人民同情摩洛哥共产党
    司法迫害不能改变共产党人的信念
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社巴黎20日讯：法国“人道报”发表了摩洛哥共产党中央委员会第一书记阿里·亚塔就摩洛哥上诉法院最近作出的关于禁止摩洛哥共产党活动的决定所发表的谈话。
    亚塔说，这次司法迫害的主谋者在我们的政策和我们的活动方面无法找出破绽，因为我们的政策和我们的活动都是以工人阶级、人民和全国的利益而决定的。他们攻击的借口都是根本不存在的，是他们强加于我们的，他们反对的是我们所遵循的马克思列宁主义理论。他们想用这种办法除掉摩洛哥共产党。
    亚塔接着说，上诉法院的决定是违背人民的愿望的，是违背民主宪法条款的。这个决定创造了一个先例，我国任何一个政党、团体和爱国人士都将不会忽视这个先例的危险性。
    亚塔说，我们可以肯定地说，这一决定激起了公愤，人民表示同情摩洛哥共产党。
    亚塔指出，共产党领导准备采取一切合法的手段，首先是提出上诉。他说，上诉法院的决定并不能改变摩洛哥共产党人的信念。摩洛哥共产党人今后仍将像以往一样孜孜不倦地为摩洛哥人民和国家服务。
