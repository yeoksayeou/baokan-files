    Recently, I saw the "Fine Arts Film Production Exhibition" and the "Puppet Show and Shadow Play Performance." These two forms of film and drama seem like sisters, meeting happily in the capital today. Under the care and cultivation of the Party, they have developed greatly. Especially under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, the comrades working in these two fields are implementing the Party's literary and artistic line, giving play to the spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, bringing about a great leap forward in fine arts films and puppet and shadow plays.

    Shadow puppetry is a type of Chinese folk drama, said to have a history of over a thousand years. Like other folk dramas, it has been reborn after liberation under the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new." The recent performances in Beijing, whether they were traditional myths, fairy tales, and fables that had been reorganized and adapted, or new programs reflecting the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, were all well received by the audience. I believe that in order to develop shadow puppetry, in addition to improving professional troupes, we should also attach importance to vigorously promoting it among the masses, because shadow puppetry is simple and easy to perform, and very suitable for amateur cultural activities of the masses.

    Of course, there is currently a difficult problem: how to solve the problem of a set of shadow puppetry equipment? Where to buy the puppets? I think substitutes can be used. I remember that the Lu Xun Academy of Arts' Central China Branch Performing Arts Troupe performed "Shadow Plays" in the anti-Japanese democratic base areas (because they were not made of leather, they were renamed "Shadow Plays"). At that time, thick cardboard or cigarette boxes (boxes for a pack) were used to make the characters. The faces and bodies of the characters could be carved out a bit, and colored cellophane or cellophane paper (candy wrappers) were attached as patterns for the costumes. The "screen" can be replaced with bed sheets and tablecloths. In the simplest form, a long bench can be turned upside down and white paper pasted on the legs. For lighting, the most ideal today is to use fluorescent lamps, but other lights or candles can also be used instead. Use more lights and place them in different places to try to avoid the shadows of the "rods" supporting the characters from appearing on the "screen."

    In short, the equipment for shadow puppetry can be simple and adapted according to specific conditions. If the development of shadow puppetry can also "walk on two legs," making it a form of amateur cultural activity widely carried out in factories, mines, communes, troops, and schools, especially with more targeting of children and teenagers, then this artistic form, which is loved by the masses, will surely play a greater role under the illumination of the "Three Red Banners."

    开展业余皮影戏活动
    吴耘
    最近看到了“美术电影制片展览会”，同时又看到了“木偶戏皮影戏观摩演出”。这种样式的电影和戏剧好像是一对姐妹，今天在首都喜相逢。她们在党的关怀和培植下，有了很大的发展。特别在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，这两行的工作同志执行着党的文艺路线，发挥了敢想敢说敢做的精神，使美术电影和木偶戏皮影戏来了个大跃进。
    皮影戏是我国民间戏剧的一种，据说已经有一千多年的历史，它和其他的民间戏剧一样，解放后，在党的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针下，获得了新生。最近在北京的演出，不论是经过整理改编的传统神话故事、童话、寓言，或是反映总路线、大跃进和人民公社的新节目，都得到了观众的好评。我觉得为了发展皮影戏，除去专业剧团的提高外，还应该重视在群众中大力推广。因为皮影戏简单易行很适合群众业余的文化活动。
    当然，目前有一个难题，就是一套皮影戏的设备怎样解决？到哪里去买皮影？我想可以采取代用品。记得鲁迅艺术学院华中分院文工团在抗日民主根据地曾经演过“影子戏”（因为不是用皮做的，所以改叫“影子戏”），那时是用厚纸板或香烟盒（装一条的盒子）等做人物的，人物的脸部及身上可以雕刻出一点空来，贴上彩色油光纸或玻璃纸（包糖果的纸）作为服饰的花样。“影幕”可以用被单和桌布代用。最简单的，可以用一条长板凳反过来，在凳子腿上糊上白纸就行了。灯光，今天最理想的是用日光灯，也可以用别的灯光或腊烛来代替，多用几个灯，放在不同的地方尽量使支持人物的“耍杆儿”，不要在“影幕”上露出影子来。
    总之，皮影戏的设备，可以因陋就简，根据具体条件而改变。如果皮影戏的发展也能“两条腿走路”，使皮影戏成为厂矿、公社、部队、学校广泛开展业余文艺活动的一种形式，特别是更多以少年儿童为对象。那么，这个为群众所喜闻乐见的艺术形式，在“三面红旗”的照耀下，一定会发挥更大的作用。
