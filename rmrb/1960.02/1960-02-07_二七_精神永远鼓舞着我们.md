    "February 7th" Spirit Will Always Inspire Us
    Hang Baohua, Old Worker of the "February 7th" at Changxindian Locomotive Factory
    The "February 7th" revolutionary struggle happened thirty-seven years ago. But I have never forgotten the scene of the struggle at that time. Every time I talk about the "February 7th" struggle, not only other comrades are educated, but I am also educated at the same time.

    To be honest, before 1921, we workers did not understand any revolutionary principles. At that time, we worked ourselves to death and couldn't even get enough food and clothing. Who knew it was the result of exploitation and oppression by others? We all blamed ourselves for our bad luck! Later, after the Party's education, our minds slowly opened up, and we understood that if workers wanted to stand up, they must firmly follow the Party, unite, and resolutely fight against the exploiting classes and reactionaries. At that time, although we didn't quite understand what communism was all about, one thing was clear: doing revolution was for everyone, not just for ourselves. At the same time, through actual struggles, we increasingly realized that only when workers unite and fight the vicious enemy can we achieve victory. For example, in 1922, workers' lives became even more impoverished. Under the leadership of the trade union, we put forward eight demands to the railway bureau to improve our lives and implement an eight-hour working day. At that time, Zhao Jixian, the pseudo-Director of the Beijing-Hankou Railway Bureau, even threatened the workers, saying, "If you strike, you won't even have cornbread to eat!" But no one heeded his threat. Everyone was determined to "have the Communist Party over their heads, a revolutionary heart in their chests, a knife of unity in their hands, to leave their wives and children, and to die gloriously," and resolutely went on strike. Everyone also went to the station to intercept trains. Some workers lay on the tracks, intercepting every train that came, even military trains. The enemy threatened the workers with gleaming bayonets, but none of the workers were afraid, and they rushed forward with their chests out. This strike was the first time we cut off the north-south traffic of the Beijing-Hankou Railway. The reactionaries had no choice but to agree to our eight demands. In early 1923, under the leadership of the Party, the workers of the Beijing-Hankou Railway further realized the importance of organizing, and decided to establish the Beijing-Hankou Railway General Trade Union in Zhengzhou on February 1st. However, this plan was sabotaged by the then-warlord Wu Peifu, and it was not realized. On February 4th, the Beijing-Hankou Railway held a full-line strike. On the 6th, the reactionaries sent troops to suppress us and arrested our twelve trade union cadres.

    On the morning of the 7th, more than two thousand of us workers gathered in front of the pseudo-police station at the Huoshen Temple in Changxindian, demanding the release of the trade union cadres. Just as we were rushing forward, two rows of soldiers with bayonets emerged from the Huoshen Temple, facing us menacingly. Ge Shugui, the workers' picketer, shouted, "Comrades, let's rush up! They have guns, we have blood, and we must repay blood debts with blood! We will never retreat." Thus, everyone rushed up. In this heroic struggle, Ge Shugui and several other comrades sacrificed themselves. On the same day, many outstanding workers in Hankou Jiang'an and Zhengzhou were also subjected to the shameless massacre of the warlords. At that time, doing revolution was like "hanging your head on your belt," but for the benefit of everyone, no one put their own life in their heart.

    These are some of the things I experienced at that time. In these thrilling revolutionary events, the revolutionary spirit of our working class and the lofty qualities of our revolutionary predecessors are prominently displayed. That is: firmly listen to the Party's words and firmly follow the Party; fight the enemy resolutely and bravely, without any fear; for the sake of the interests of the revolution, for the sake of the interests of everyone, we can shed our heads and spill our blood, sacrificing everything of our own; sharing weal and woe, sharing hardships, and always uniting with our brothers at all times. All these noble spirits and qualities are what we should always inherit and carry forward. The "February 7th" spirit is a valuable legacy of the people of the whole country, and it will always inspire us to go from victory to greater victory. (Originally published in "Chinese Workers")

    “二七”精神永远鼓舞着我们
    长辛店机车厂“二七”老工人　杭宝华
    “二七”革命斗争已经是三十七年前的事了。但是当时斗争的情景我一天也没有忘记过。每次谈起“二七”斗争，不仅别的同志会受到教育，我自己也同时受到教育。
    说实在的，在1921年以前，我们工人是不懂得什么革命道理的。那时我们干死干活，不得温饱，谁知道是别人剥削压迫的结果，还不都是怨自己命苦！后来经过党的教育，脑子才慢慢地开了窍，懂得了工人要翻身，就必须坚定地跟着党走，团结起来，同剥削阶级和反动派作坚决斗争。当时我们虽然对共产主义是怎么回事还弄不太清楚，但有一条是明确的：干革命是为了大家，而不是只为自己。同时，通过实际的斗争，也越来越认识到，只有工人团结起来，和凶恶的敌人干，才能得到胜利。比如1922年，工人生活更加贫困了，我们就在工会的领导下，向铁路局提出改善生活、实行八小时工作制的八项要求，当时伪京汉铁路局长赵继贤还威胁工人说：“罢工就没有窝窝头吃！”但谁也不顾他的威胁，大家都抱着“头顶共产党，怀揣革命心，手持团结刀，别妻离子，死也光荣”的决心，坚决罢工。大家还到车站去截车。有的工友躺在车轨上，火车来一趟截一趟，就连兵车也不放过。敌人端着寒光闪闪的刺刀威胁工人，工人谁都不怕，挺着胸脯冲上去，这次罢工，我们第一次切断了京汉路南北的交通。反动派没有办法，最后不得不答应我们的八项要求。1923年初，京汉铁路工人在党的领导下，进一步认识到组织起来的重要性，决定2月1日在郑州成立京汉铁路总工会。但是这个计划遭到当时军阀吴佩孚的破坏，没有实现。2月4日，京汉铁路举行了全路大罢工。6日，反动派派来军队镇压我们，逮捕了我们的十二名工会干部。
    7日早晨，我们两千多工人聚集在长辛店火神庙伪警察局门口，要求释放工会干部。正当我们向前冲的时候，从火神庙里出来了两排托着刺刀的士兵，杀气腾腾地对着我们。工人纠察队的葛树贵喊道：“工友们，我们冲上去！他们有枪，我们有血，血债要用血来还！我们决不后退。”这样，大家就冲上去了。在这次英勇斗争中，葛树贵等好几位工友牺牲了。在同一天，汉口江岸、郑州也有不少优秀工人遭到了军阀的无耻屠杀。那时干革命就等于“把脑袋挂在腰带上”，但为了大家伙的利益，谁也没有把自己的生命放在心上。
    这就是我当时经历的一些事情。在这些惊心动魄的革命事件中，突出地显示了我们工人阶级的革命精神和革命前辈的崇高品质，这就是：坚定地听党的话，坚定地跟着党走；和敌人作斗争，坚决勇敢，毫无畏惧之心；为了革命的利益，为了大家伙的利益，可以抛头颅、洒热血，牺牲自己的一切；同患难，共艰苦，任何时候，都和自己的兄弟团结在一起。所有这些崇高的精神和品质，都是我们应该永远继承和发扬的。“二七”精神是全国人民的宝贵遗产，它将永远鼓舞着我们从胜利走向更大胜利。（原载“中国工人”）
