Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The medical battalion of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army helped the Chengguan Commune in Huolu, Hebei Province, successfully trial-produce No. 5406 antibiotic fertilizer, promoting the rapid construction of 184 antibiotic fertilizer plants in the area. This medical battalion was selected by Shijiazhuang City as an advanced unit of the troops participating in local agricultural production and sent representatives to attend the Hebei Provincial Conference of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction.

Last spring, the Party committee of the medical battalion discovered that the Fujiazhuang Production Team of the Chengguan Commune in Huolu was short of fertilizer, so they sent chemist Liu Hongbin to the hospital to learn how to make antibiotic fertilizer. After returning, under the specific guidance of the battalion commander, he absorbed several commune members to participate in the trial production. During the trial production, Liu Hongbin and the commune members stayed in the culture room for more than ten consecutive days, working until late at night every day. After the trial production was successful, they helped the commune build a factory. During the construction of the factory, under the leadership of the commune Party committee, they adopted the principles of mobilizing the masses, making use of local resources, and using indigenous methods instead of foreign ones, spending only 200 yuan to build an antibiotic fertilizer plant.

After the antibiotic fertilizer plant started production, the Party committee of the medical battalion and the local Party committee jointly studied the trial application in various crops. Fifteen mu of wheat grew very poorly during field inspection. Some people suggested pulling them out. After applying antibiotic fertilizer for less than a week, the wheat seedlings changed from yellow to green, and in twenty days, they caught up with the second-class seedlings. The Fujiazhuang Production Team used antibiotic fertilizer on 980 mu of wheat, with an average increase of 17.2% compared to 1958, and 8% higher than the wheat that did not use antibiotic fertilizer. Four hundred and fifty-two mu of cotton using antibiotic fertilizer grew with large plants and many bolls, with an average increase of 33% per mu compared to 1958, and 15% higher than the cotton that did not use antibiotic fertilizer. After the Shijiazhuang scientific research department and Hebei Medical College studied the antibiotic fertilizer produced by this factory, they believed that it had three major advantages: wide and convenient application, suitable for grain and cotton crops, tuber crops, and also for vegetables; it can be used in conjunction with sowing, transplanting, replanting, irrigation, and other operations, and has the functions of preventing and controlling diseases and pests and improving the soil; the cost is low, and labor is saved, with each catty of antibiotic fertilizer costing only two cents, and one catty of antibiotic fertilizer can replace eight hundred catties of crude fertilizer. Raw materials such as cottonseed cake and green mud needed to make antibiotic fertilizer are easily available locally, and the technology is easy for the masses to master.

In order to increase production, the Party committee of the medical battalion and the local Party committee jointly led the technical innovation of the factory, increasing the original monthly output from 250 catties to 3,000 catties. After the local Party committee promoted the experience of this factory, 184 antibiotic fertilizer plants were built in the Huolu area, with a monthly output of more than 4 million catties of antibiotic fertilizer. Hebei Province and Shijiazhuang City also held five on-site meetings in Huolu to promote the experience of running antibiotic fertilizer plants in this area.

Xinhua News Agency, 19th: A certain school of the Nanjing area troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army equipped the Dantu People's Commune in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, with an agricultural machinery plant, a cultural center, and a health station.

The school's practice factory has relatively complete mechanical equipment. In January of this year, the school's Party committee and the Dantu People's Commune jointly formulated a plan for agricultural technological transformation. They mobilized students and workers and, in conjunction with teaching activities, used waste steel to manufacture a complete set of agricultural machinery plant equipment for the Dantu Commune in ten days, including lathes, electric motors, electric bench drills, electric welding machines, electric disc saws, grinders, and generators capable of providing lighting for 600 electric lights. It usually takes more than a month to manufacture this set of equipment.

This set of agricultural machinery plant equipment, together with the equipment for the cultural center and health station donated by officers and soldiers and staff, was delivered to the Dantu People's Commune on January 25th. They helped install the machines, set up the power lines, and began to help the commune train technicians and health workers. That night, the generator started supplying power, and hundreds of electric lights shone brightly. The nine workshops of the agricultural machinery plant, including metal, steel file, wheel, and small hardware workshops, are also preparing to start production. Agricultural machinery such as wheat and rice threshers and sprayers, which could not be manufactured in the past, can now be manufactured by themselves. The Dantu People's Commune has revised its agricultural modernization plan based on the new technical equipment conditions. All handicraft factories in the commune are preparing to be transformed into power-operated semi-mechanized factories in the second quarter.

    解放军官兵促进农业现代化
    某部队卫生营帮助获鹿城关公社建设菌肥厂
    南京部队某学校为丹徒公社装备农业机械厂
    据新华社19日讯　中国人民解放军某部卫生营，帮助河北获鹿城关公社试制成功五四○六号抗生菌肥料，促进当地迅速建成一百八十四个菌肥厂。这个卫生营被石家庄市选为部队参加地方农业生产的先进单位，派代表出席了河北省社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表会议。
    去年春季，卫生营党委发现获鹿城关公社傅家庄生产队肥料不足，便派化验员刘洪斌去医院学习制造菌肥。回来后，在营长的具体指导下，吸收几名公社社员参加，进行试制。在试制中，刘洪斌和社员一起连续十余天睡在培养室里，每天工作到深夜。试制成功后，便帮助公社建厂。建厂中，他们在公社党委的领导下，采取发动群众、因陋就简、以土代洋的方针，仅花二百元就建成了一所菌肥厂。
    菌肥厂开始生产以后，卫生营党委又和地方党委一起研究在各种作物中试用。有十五亩小麦在查田时长得很不好，有人建议拔掉，追上菌肥不到一星期，麦苗由黄变青，二十天就赶上了二类苗。傅家庄生产队有九百八十亩小麦使用了菌肥，平均比1958年增产17．2％，比没有使用菌肥的小麦增产8％。有四百五十二亩使用菌肥的棉花，长得株大桃多，平均每亩比1958年增产33％，比没有使用菌肥的增产15％。石家庄科学研究部门和河北医学院研究了这个厂制造的菌肥以后，认为有三大好处：应用广泛方便，适于粮棉作物、薯类作物，也可用于蔬菜；使用时可结合播种、移苗、补苗、灌水等操作进行，并且有防治病虫害、改良土壤的作用；成本低廉，节省劳力，每斤菌肥仅合二分钱，一斤菌肥可顶八百斤粗肥。制造菌肥用的棉仁饼、青泥土等原料当地很容易取得，技术也容易为群众掌握。
    为了提高产量，卫生营党委和地方党委，共同领导了这个工厂的技术革新，由原来月产二百五十斤提高到三千斤。当地党委推广了这个厂的经验后，获鹿地区就建成了一百八十四个菌肥厂，月产菌肥四百余万斤。河北省、石家庄市也先后在获鹿召开五次现场会，推广这个地区办菌肥厂的经验。
    据新华社19日讯　中国人民解放军南京地区部队某学校，为江苏省镇江丹徒人民公社装备了一个农业机械厂和一个文化馆、一个保健站。
    这个学校实习工厂有较完整的机械设备。学校党委在今年1月和丹徒人民公社共同商订出农业技术改造的规划。他们发动学员、工人，用十天时间，结合教学活动，利用废钢铁，给丹徒公社制造了一整套农业机械厂的设备，其中包括车床、电动机、电动台钻、电焊机、电动盘锯、砂轮机和可供六百盏电灯照明用的发电机等。通常制造这套设备，需要一个多月。
    这套农业机械厂的设备，连同官兵、职工捐赠的文化馆、保健站的设备，在1月25日送到了丹徒人民公社。他们帮助安装了机器，架设了电线，并且开始帮助公社训练技术工人和保健员。当晚，发电机开始供电，几百盏电灯大放光明。农业机械厂的金属、钢锉、车轮、小五金等九个车间，也准备开工生产，过去不能制造的麦类和水稻脱粒机、喷雾器等农业机械，现在可以自己制造了。丹徒人民公社根据新的技术设备条件，重订了农业现代化规划。全社所有的手工业工厂，准备在第二季度改成动力操作的半机械化工厂。
