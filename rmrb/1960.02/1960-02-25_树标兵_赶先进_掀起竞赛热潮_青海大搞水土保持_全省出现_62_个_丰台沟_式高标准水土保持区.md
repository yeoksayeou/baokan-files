    Establish Model Units, Catch Up with the Advanced, and Launch a Competition upsurge
    Qinghai Vigorously Promotes Soil and Water Conservation
    62 "Fengtaigou"-Style High-Standard Soil and Water Conservation Areas Appear Throughout the Province
    (Our report) The mass movement of "Learning from Fengtai, Catching up with Fengtai, and Surpassing Fengtai" to vigorously promote soil and water conservation, which has been widely carried out in rural Qinghai, has achieved brilliant results. As of January 24, various agricultural areas had built more than 560,000 mu of terraced fields on barren hillsides, cultivated more than 1.27 million mu of field ridges, and built a large number of dams, ponds, and gully head protection projects, controlling a total of 2,641 square kilometers of severely eroded areas, completing 94.3% of the soil and water conservation plan for last winter and this spring. Sixty-two "Fengtaigou"-style high-standard soil and water conservation areas have emerged throughout the province, basically achieving the requirements of "water does not go down the mountain, mud does not leave the gully, heavy rain does not cause disaster, and a good harvest is guaranteed without rain."
    More than 80% of the cultivated land in the agricultural areas of Qinghai is in mountainous areas, and the mountain population accounts for about 80% of the total population of the province. Before liberation, due to blind reclamation, a large amount of soil was lost in many areas, yields decreased year by year, and people's lives became increasingly impoverished. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of peasants launched a tenacious struggle against the barren mountains and evil waters. The Fengtaigou Production Team of Lushaer Commune in Huangzhong County played the role of shock force in this struggle to change the face of the mountainous area, and became a model for mountainous area construction in the province. Since 1956, when this production team began to vigorously promote soil and water conservation, it has achieved high-standard soil and water conservation in just three years, comprehensively controlled soil erosion, and increased grain yield per mu by nearly one time.
    Since October last year, various regions have taken Fengtaigou as an example and vigorously promoted soil and water conservation in conjunction with winter water conservancy construction. After the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee convened a soil and water conservation broadcasting conference in late November, various regions further launched a competition upsurge of "Learning from Fengtai, Catching up with Fengtai, and Surpassing Fengtai" to vigorously promote soil and water conservation.
    Many areas, taking the commune as a unit, adopted the method of joint operations, so that the area of soil and water conservation gradually expanded from the original points to the surface. On the basis of the original Fengtaigou, the Lushaer Commune in Huangzhong County, in conjunction with the adjacent Handong Commune, based on the example already set by Fengtaigou, transferred more than 3,800 commune members, divided them into three work areas and twenty work sections, and began a thorough and comprehensive management of the entire Dongjianling Mountain area at the top of Fengtaigou. Since construction began at the end of October last year, more than 7,000 mu of horizontal terraces and terraces and more than 3,400 meters of horizontal steps have been completed.

    树标兵　赶先进　掀起竞赛热潮
    青海大搞水土保持
    全省出现62个“丰台沟”式高标准水土保持区
    本报讯　青海农村广泛开展的“学丰台、赶丰台、超丰台”的大搞水土保持群众运动，获得了辉煌成果。到1月24日，农业区各地已经在荒山坡地上修梯田五十六万多亩，培地埂一百二十七万多亩，修建了大量的水坝、涝池和沟头防护工程，共治理严重的水土流失面积二千六百四十一平方公里，完成去冬今春水土保持计划任务的94．3％。全省各地出现了六十二个“丰台沟”式的高标准水土保持区，基本上达到了“水不下山，泥不出沟，大雨不成灾，无雨保丰收”的要求。
    青海农业区80％以上的耕地是在山区，山区人口占全省总人口的80％左右。解放前，由于盲目开垦，结果许多地区泥土大量流失，产量一年不如一年，人民生活日益贫困。解放后，广大农民在党的领导下，向穷山恶水展开了顽强的斗争，湟中县鲁沙尔公社的丰台沟生产队，在这场改变山区面貌的斗争中，起到了突击手的作用，成为全省山区建设的一个标兵。这个生产队自1956年开始大搞水土保持以来，在短短三年中就实现了水土保持的高标准化，全面治理了水土流失现象，使粮食亩产提高将近一倍。
    各地从去年10月开始，就以丰台沟为榜样，结合冬修水利大搞水土保持。11月下旬，中共青海省委召开水土保持广播大会以后，各地又进一步掀起了“学丰台、赶丰台、超丰台”的竞赛热潮，大搞水土保持。
    许多地区以公社为单位，采取联合作战的办法，使水土保持的区域，由原来的点逐步扩大成面。湟中县鲁沙尔公社在原来丰台沟的基础上，联合毗邻的汉东公社，根据丰台沟已经作出的榜样，抽调三千八百多名社员，划分三个工区，二十个工段，对丰台沟沟顶的整个东尖岭山区开始了彻底的全面综合治理。从去年10月底开工以来，已经完成了水平梯田和梯田七千多亩，水平阶三千四百多米。（金元明）（附图片）
