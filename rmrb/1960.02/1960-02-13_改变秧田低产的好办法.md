    Good Ways to Change Low Yields in Rice Seedbeds

    In the spring planting campaign, the Cenxi County Committee in Guangxi province, following last year's measure of establishing large-scale field fertilizer stations, has adopted another new measure: universally utilizing rice seedbeds to ferment "tang" fertilizer. This measure can guarantee the cultivation of strong seedlings and change the historically low yields of rice seedbeds. Therefore, a mass movement to ferment "tang" fertilizer in rice seedbeds has quickly formed throughout the county.

    In most areas of Cenxi County, the method of transplanting seedlings involves digging up a layer of fertile mud that is four to five tenths of an inch thick. This causes the soil quality of the rice seedbeds to become increasingly barren. Additionally, transplanting in the rice seedbeds is generally later than in the main fields, so the good fertilizer has mostly been applied to the main fields already. The remaining fertilizer is both scarce and of poor quality, insufficient to compensate for the fertilizer lost from the rice seedbeds themselves. Therefore, the yields of rice seedbeds have historically been lower than those of the main fields, generally yielding two to three hundred *jin* less per *mu* each year. Vigorously fermenting "tang" fertilizer in rice seedbeds means developing small pit fermentation into whole rice seedbed fermentation, so that each *mu* of rice seedbed has better "tang" fertilizer as a foundation, ensuring that the seedlings are green, lush, and robust. Moreover, after transplanting the seedlings, the soil quality of the rice seedbed remains fertile, enabling the rice seedbed yield to catch up with or even surpass that of the main field, achieving comprehensive and balanced yield increases.

    改变秧田低产的好办法
    广西岑溪县在备耕运动中，县委继去年采取大搞田间肥料站之后的又一新措施，普遍利用秧田沤制氹肥。这个措施能保证育好壮秧改变秧田历年低产的面貌。因此，全县很快形成了一个群众性的大搞秧田沤制氹肥运动。
    岑溪县各地大都是采用铲秧的办法，一铲就铲去四五分厚的肥泥，使秧田的土质越来越瘦瘠，加上秧田插秧一般要比本田迟，这时好肥已大都放下本田去了，剩下的肥料既少又差，不足以补偿秧田本身所损耗的肥料。因此，历年来秧田产量都比本田的低，一般每年每亩要少收二百至三百斤。大搞秧田沤制肥，就是把小坑沤肥发展成为整块秧田沤肥，使每亩秧田有较好的氹肥作为基础，保证秧苗青绿茁壮，而且在铲秧后秧田土质仍然肥沃，使秧田产量能够赶上甚至超过本田，做到全面平衡增产。
