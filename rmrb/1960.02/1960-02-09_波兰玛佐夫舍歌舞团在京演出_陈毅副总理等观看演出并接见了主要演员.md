Xinhua News Agency, February 8th: Ten thousand Beijing audience members enjoyed a wonderful artistic performance by the Polish Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble at the Great Hall of the People tonight. The Polish artists' successful performance was met with wave after wave of warm applause from the audience.

Tonight, Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo and Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Burhan, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong, Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing, Deputy Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Zhang Zhixiang, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan, and others, along with Polish Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to China, Fu Lato, watched the performance. During the intermission, Vice Premier Chen Yi and others met with Bogusław Płusa, representative of the Polish Ministry of Culture and Art, Mira Zimińska-Sygietyńska, director of the song and dance ensemble, and the main actors of the ensemble. Vice Premier Chen Yi was also invited to write an inscription for the song and dance ensemble as a memento. The inscription read: "May the friendship between China and Poland last forever!"

The auditorium of the Great Hall of the People was filled with the atmosphere of spring tonight. The musical and dance programs performed by the song and dance ensemble were lighthearted, joyful, and deeply moving. These programs all originated from folk traditions and were refined through processing and arrangement. The actors performing these programs were selected from rural areas for their artistic talent. Therefore, the ensemble's performance has a distinct folk style and local flavor. The Chinese songs "Singing of Mao Zedong" and "Singing of the Motherland," sung by the artists in Chinese, were encored amidst warm applause from the audience. The famous Polish song "Little Cuckoo," sung by the artists in both Polish and Chinese, was even more warmly received.

This song and dance ensemble visited China in 1953, and their wonderful performances are still remembered by Chinese audiences. Seven years later, the ensemble has brought even richer and more colorful artistic programs to the Chinese people. They will be visiting and performing in China for more than a month.

After tonight's performance, hundreds of young actors and actresses from the capital presented flowers to the Polish artists. Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairmen Guo Moruo and Lin Feng, and others, went on stage to meet with the artists and congratulate them on their successful performance. At this moment, the whole audience gave a long and enthusiastic applause.

Those who watched tonight's performance included people from all walks of life in the capital and diplomatic envoys from various countries to China.

    人民大会堂的大礼堂今晚满堂生春，歌舞团表演的音乐歌舞节目，轻松愉快，动人心弦。这些节目都是来自民间，经过加工整理提炼出来的。表演这些节目的演员，又是从农村中选拔出来的有艺术才能的男女青年。所以，歌舞团的表演具有鲜明的民间风格和乡土气息。艺术家们用中国话演唱的中国歌曲“歌唱毛泽东”和“歌唱祖国”等，都在观众的热烈掌声中重唱了一次。艺术家们用波中两国话轮唱的波兰著名歌曲“小杜鹃”受到更为热烈的欢迎。
    这个歌舞团1953年曾经访问过中国，他们的精彩表演至今还留在我国观众的记忆里。七年以后的今天，歌舞团带给中国人民的，是更加丰富多彩的艺术节目，他们将在中国作一个多月的访问演出。
    今晚的演出结束以后，上百名首都男女青年演员向波兰的艺术家们分赠了鲜花，陈毅副总理、郭沫若、林枫副委员长等，登台同艺术家们会见，祝贺他们的演出成功。这时，全场长时间地热烈鼓掌。
