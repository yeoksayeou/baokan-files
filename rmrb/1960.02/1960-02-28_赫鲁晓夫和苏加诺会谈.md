Xinhua News Agency, February 27th dispatch: TASS reported that Soviet Premier Khrushchev and Indonesian President Sukarno held formal talks today in Bogor.

Khrushchev returned to Jakarta from Bali yesterday, and delivered a speech at the Indonesian Parliament in the afternoon. He said that the improvement of the overall international atmosphere does not mean that all difficulties have now been eliminated. He spoke about the recently signed Japan-U.S. military treaty, saying that it is a dangerous trick for the Japanese ruling clique to continue to maintain foreign military bases on its territory, greatly expand its armed forces, and attempt to enslave the people of East Asia again.

Khrushchev said that the elimination of the colonial system is closely linked to the issue of peace. He pointed out that the struggle against colonialism is far from over, and the colonialists will not automatically give up their positions. In his speech, Khrushchev expressed his support for Indonesia's struggle to recover West Irian.

    赫鲁晓夫和苏加诺会谈
    据新华社27日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和印度尼西亚总统苏加诺今天在茂物举行正式会谈。
    赫鲁晓夫昨天从巴厘回到雅加达，当天下午在印度尼西亚议会上发表了演说。他说，整个国际气氛的改善，并不意味着现在已经消除了一切困难。他谈到最近签订的日美军事条约，他说，日本统治集团继续保持外国在它的领土的军事基地，大大扩充它的武装部队，企图再度奴役东亚人民，这是很危险的把戏。
    赫鲁晓夫说，消灭殖民主义制度同和平问题有着紧密的联系。他指出，反对殖民主义的斗争还远没有结束，殖民主义者不会自动放弃自己的阵地。赫鲁晓夫在演说中表示支持印度尼西亚收复西伊里安的斗争。
