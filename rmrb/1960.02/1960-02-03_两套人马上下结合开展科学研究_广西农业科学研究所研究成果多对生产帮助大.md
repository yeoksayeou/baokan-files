    Two Teams Working Together From Top to Bottom to Carry Out Scientific Research
    Guangxi Agricultural Science Institute's Research Achievements Greatly Help Production

    (Our Dispatch) The Guangxi Agricultural Science Institute, adopting the method of two teams, working together from top to bottom, to carry out scientific research, has achieved fruitful results in the past year. Practice has proven that combining the scientific research of the institute with on-site experiments in production not only enriches research results but also promptly promotes production.

    In 1959, the six departments of the Guangxi Agricultural Science Institute, with personnel stationed in communes and those remaining at the institute, in addition to systematically summarizing the large-scale high-yield experiences of crops such as rice, corn, sweet potatoes, peanuts, and cotton, achieved results in fourteen major scientific research projects in fixed design, cultivation, breeding, and experimentation. Another eleven projects, encompassing twenty-three items of varying sizes, began to find solutions, of which eleven projects, encompassing forty-seven items of varying sizes, passed appraisal and are prepared for widespread promotion this year. These research projects include: high-yield cultivation and selection of superior varieties of grain, oil, and fiber crops, research on soil, fertilizer, pesticides, and feed, high-yield fruit tree research, and rapid seedling cultivation. In terms of grain crops, many valuable data were obtained based on the research topics proposed by the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture." For example, regarding the issue of selecting superior rice varieties, through rice variety comparison, large-scale selection and breeding, and hybridization experiments, fourteen high-yield varieties of early and late rice were selected, which increased production by 14% to 40% compared to the currently promoted superior varieties in Guangxi. Through wheat summer and autumn sowing experiments, the possibility of planting wheat twice a year on the same piece of land was explored.

    In the process of carrying out scientific research, personnel stationed in the people's communes are both summarizers of mass production and powerful assistants in carrying out on-site production experiments, promoting scientific research achievements, and assisting local Party committees in doing a good job of production, focusing on the current key to production. More than thirty technicians and technical staff from the six research groups—rice, miscellaneous grains, economic crops, vegetables, and fruit trees—in the past year, through eating, living, working, and researching with farmers, observed, understood, and summarized the advanced production experiences of the masses, writing a total of forty-seven summary papers; carried out forty-three scientific research projects, many of which have blossomed and borne fruit in mass production. For example, the rice advanced experience summary research group stationed in the Gutang Brigade of the Chengxiang Commune in Luchuan County, based on the preliminary results of the institute's experiment on different densities of five rice varieties, conducted four different density experiments in three different types of paddy fields: fertile, medium, and lean. Finally, after organizing the masses in each production team to harvest and compare, they obtained the specification with the highest yield increase. As a result, this specification was immediately promoted and applied by the masses. In the past, superior varieties selected by the institute were not easily promoted after being distributed to various places, and the masses often thought: "The conditions at the scientific research institute are good; we can't use them." In 1959, the researchers stationed in the communes personally brought the superior varieties cultivated by the institute down to the communes and conducted comparative experiments with local varieties together with the masses. During the harvest, they organized mass evaluations, and as a result, the masses were convinced by the fact that the superior varieties they had harvested yielded high yields.

    The personnel remaining at the institute, through research and appraisal work at the institute, not only enriched, developed, and confirmed the research results and experience summaries reported by the personnel stationed in the communes and the working groups temporarily sent down, but also, in some cases, due to the combination of efforts from top to bottom and close integration with mass production practice, quickly drew conclusions and shortened the research time. For example, when the research group stationed in Shangshi Commune in Ningming discovered citrus fruit flies, after being identified by the Institute of Entomology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences as a quarantine pest first discovered on the mainland, the institute immediately, based on the identification, arranged for the personnel stationed in the communes to make specimens and distribute them to various counties with oriental fruit flies for distinction. At the same time, under the leadership of the Science and Technology Commission of the Autonomous Region, the institute, together with the Forestry Department and agricultural colleges, formed a fruit tree survey team. Combining the survey of fruit tree resources, they ascertained the distribution, living habits, and control methods of citrus fruit flies in the autonomous region. As another example, when the research group stationed in Litang Commune in Binyang was conducting research on the sowing period and deep plowing of cotton in Guangxi, the institute, based on the field research of the stationed personnel, also conducted experiments on different sowing periods and different depths of deep plowing at the institute. At the same time, it organized personnel to conduct relevant investigations and research in Daxin, Jingxi, and other key cotton-growing counties. Through these three parallel approaches, they finally concluded that the appropriate sowing period in Guangxi is generally from early April to early May, and deep plowing is appropriate at one chi (Chinese foot). Originally, it would take three years to reach a conclusion on the study of the sowing period in Guangxi, but due to the combination of efforts from top to bottom and the combination of specific points and the overall situation, this research task was completed within one year.

    After the technical personnel of the Agricultural Science Institute went deep into reality and among the masses, they not only oriented scientific research towards production and enriched the content of scientific research but also cultivated agricultural technical talents and promoted scientific research activities among the masses. In this year, the personnel stationed in the communes successively organized forty activities involving 8,400 people to conduct scientific experiments, on-site visits, and impart knowledge. As soon as the stationed research group was transferred, the masses immediately established a scientific research station and took on the responsibility of leading the masses to carry out scientific research, which was originally the responsibility of the stationed group.

    两套人马上下结合开展科学研究
    广西农业科学研究所研究成果多对生产帮助大
    本报讯　采取两套人马、上下结合的方法，开展科学研究的广西农业科学研究所，一年来获得丰硕的成果。实践证明，把研究所的科学研究同生产现场的实验相结合，不但丰富了研究成果，而且及时推动了生产。
    1959年一年中，广西农业科学研究所所属的六个系，长驻公社人员和留所人员，除了系统地总结了水稻、玉米、甘薯、花生、棉花等作物的大面积丰产经验以外，在固定设计、栽培、育种、整理和实验中，有十四个主要科学研究课题获得成果。另有十一个课题大小二十三项开始找到解决的途径，其中通过鉴定有十一个课题大小四十七项准备在今年广泛推广。这些研究课题包括：粮食、油料、纤维等作物的丰产栽培和良种选育，土壤、肥料、农药、饲料的研究，果树丰产研究和快速育苗等项目。在粮食作物方面，根据农业“八字宪法”所提出的研究课题，得出了许多有价值的资料。如水稻选育良种问题，通过水稻品种比较，大面积选种、杂交育种等研究试验，选出了早、晚稻十四个高产品种，比当前广西推广的优良品种都增产14％到40％。通过小麦夏秋播种实验，探索出小麦在同一块土地上一年栽种两次的可能性。
    在开展科学研究过程中，长驻人民公社的人员，既是群众生产的总结者，又是围绕当前生产关键开展生产现场实验、推广科学研究成果、协助当地党委搞好生产的有力助手。水稻、杂粮、经济作物、蔬菜、果树等六个研究组的三十多名技师、技术员，一年来，在和农民同吃、同住、同劳动、同研究中，通过观察、了解，总结了群众的先进生产经验，共写出总结论文四十七篇；开展了四十三项科学研究，其中有许多项已在群众生产中开花结果。如长驻陆川县城厢公社沟塘大队的水稻先进经验总结研究小组，根据所里对五个水稻品种的不同密度的实验所得出的初步结果，在肥、中、瘦三种不同的大田里进行了四种不同密度的试验，最后经过组织各生产队群众收割评比，得出了增产最高的规格。于是，这种规格马上被群众推广应用。过去，所里选育出来的优良品种，分散到各地后不容易被推广，群众往往认为：“科学研究所的条件好，我们用可不行”。1959年，长驻公社的研究人员亲自把所里培育出来的良种带下去，和群众一起进行与当地品种的对比实验，收割时开展群众评选，结果群众被自己收割的良种丰产事实说服了。
    留在所里的人员，通过在所里的研究鉴定工作，对长驻公社人员和临时派下去的工作组总结汇报上来的研究成果以及经验总结，不仅起了丰富发展和证实的作用，而且有些课题由于上下结合，密切结合群众生产实践，迅速得出结论，缩短了研究时间。例如，当长驻宁明上石公社研究组发现蜜柑蝇以后，经过中国科学院昆虫研究所鉴定，认为是大陆上首次发现的检疫虫害，所里立即根据鉴定布置驻社人员在下面制成标本分发给有大实蝇的各县，以便区别。同时，所里在自治区科学工作委员会领导下，同林业厅、农业院校组成果树调查队，结合调查果树资源，摸清了蜜柑蝇在自治区的分布情况、生活习性和防治方法。再如，长驻宾阳黎塘公社的研究组进行广西植棉播种期和深耕课题研究时，所里根据驻社人员大田研究的情况，在所里也进行了不同播种期、不同深耕深度的试验，同时又组织人员到重点植棉的大新、靖西等县进行有关这方面的调查研究。三管齐下，最后得出在广西播种一般在4月上旬到5月上旬、深耕一尺合适的结论。本来，在广西进行播种期的研究，要三年才能得出定论，可是由于上下结合、点面结合，使这项研究任务在一年内就完成了。
    农业科学研究所的技术人员，深入实际、深入群众以后，不仅使科学研究面向生产，丰富了科学研究的内容，并且培养了农业技术人材，推动群众开展了科学研究活动。这一年中，驻社人员先后组织了四十次八千四百多人进行科学试验、现场参观、传授知识的活动，驻社研究组一调动，群众立即建立起科学研究站，担负起原来驻社小组领导群众开展科学研究的责任。
