    The Whole Nation Runs Local Industry
    Liu Yunzhao, Zhou Yizhi
    Starting from Scratch

    Comrade Zhao Chengshi returned from the army and the Pyongyang City Central District Party Committee gave him a new task: to set up a paper mill. The higher authorities only assigned the task, but did not allocate a single technician, a single worker, or a single piece of machinery to him. Zhao Chengshi pondered day and night, how could he start a factory empty-handed? He repeatedly studied the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee in June. The Party called for a nationwide movement to develop local industries. Since the whole nation was to run factories, of course everyone had to do it themselves, how could they rely on the higher authorities for everything? So he made up his mind to use his own brains and find solutions.

    Zhao Chengshi went to the place designated by the higher authorities to set up the factory and saw that it was a piece of wasteland, the old site of an iron factory, which had been destroyed by the enemy during the war, and had now become a ruin overgrown with weeds, with some newly built houses nearby after the war. He understood: "Aren't the many pieces of scrap iron on that wasteland machines? Aren't the residents nearby workers and technicians?"

    Zhao Chengshi began preparations for building the factory. He gathered a group of housewives, explained to them the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee, and mobilized everyone to pick up scrap iron and bricks to build their own machines and factory buildings. The women were very happy to hear that they were going to build a factory, but when they saw this scene, they couldn't help but have some doubts: "Can we, these housewives, build a factory from scratch on a wasteland?" But they thought, the instructions of the Labor Party and Premier Kim Il-sung could not be wrong. So everyone went to pick up scrap iron. Among this group of women was a girl named Jin Wanshi, who became a "scrap iron fanatic" from the day she joined the factory construction. She got up early every morning and immediately ran to the fields, looking for scrap iron everywhere. She treated an iron nail or a horseshoe like a treasure and put it in her pocket. One day, she found an old gear weighing sixty pounds, immediately put it on her head, and ran back happily. The paper mill's own machines needed such a large gear. But the gear had to be processed before it could be used, and they didn't have a lathe. What should they do? Jin Wanshi remembered that there was a machine factory nearby, so she went to the workers there for help with the gear on her head. It was the end of the year, and the machine factory was also rushing to complete its tasks and had no time to help others. Jin Wanshi pleaded for a long time, willing to do twice the amount of rough work for the machine factory in exchange for their help. The workers of the machine factory were moved and decided to work overtime to cut the large gear for her.

    Heroic Spirit

    Many of the machines in the Pyongyang Central District Paper Mill were made by these women using parts and scrap iron they picked up from the fields. How did they make the machines? Most of the people who participated in the construction of the factory at that time had never been to a factory. Only the old blacksmith Gui Douxi knew a little bit of technology, so he led everyone to make the machines. They asked other factories to process some of the parts for them, and they also made some parts themselves. Gui Douxi used the sharp point of a hoe to cut iron plates, used a blacksmith's furnace to melt iron to make blanks, and distributed them to everyone to file with files. He said, "In such difficult times, every hammer we strike and every file we use is an expression of our loyalty to the Party and the leader." Gui Douxi pointed to a small house in front of the factory and said, "I made this dryer, which is twice as big as it, in that blacksmith shop."

    This happened in the winter of 1958.

    Now, this paper mill with a daily output of ten tons has five paper machines with a daily output of three tons, five raw material crushers, a pulp machine, and a huge dryer... The workers in the factory are still continuing to manufacture new machines, preparing to increase the production of some high-grade industrial paper in 1960.

    The paper mill's more than 2,000 square meters of factory buildings were also built by these housewives. It was during the severe winter when the factory buildings were being built. They had no experience in building houses. The walls collapsed before they were even built to the height of one person. They built again and again, collapsed again and again, and built again and again, and finally managed to build a wall. The women carried bricks and tiles on their backs and climbed onto the roof to tile it, often working late into the night without going home. Female worker Zhao Yongshun's husband came to the construction site to look for her. She said, "You ride the Chollima, and I will also ride the Chollima."

    The Pyongyang Central District Paper Mill needs 13 tons of papermaking raw materials every day, and their solution to the raw material problem is also very moving. The workers pick out 40% of the waste from the garbage transported back from the Central District Health Office every day and use it as papermaking raw materials. There are many organs, hotels, and cinemas near the paper mill, and they throw away a lot of disposable chopsticks (Note 1), cigarette boxes, old books and newspapers, and candy wrappers every day... The workers think that this is a raw material warehouse that will never be exhausted. They made a batch of garbage cans and sent them to those places, collecting more than 30 tons of papermaking raw materials every month. They also signed contracts with many schools to exchange new notebooks with students for old notebooks, which is also a large source of raw materials. Recently, they launched a surprise campaign, and the workers collected thousands of tons of waste paper in their spare time.

    County-run Industry

    In Korea, every county (Note 2) has some local factories like the Pyongyang Central District Paper Mill that started from scratch. When we visited Huanghainando (Note 2), we visited the local industry in An Yue County. There is a textile factory there that uses wild plants, cotton stalk skins, castor bean stalk skins, rabbit hair, dog hair, cow hair, etc. as raw materials to weave more than 50 kinds of fabrics and sweaters. This factory used to be a very small handicraft production cooperative, originally with only two looms, and the factory building was also borrowed from others. Now, the entire factory has 380 employees and 75 looms, and has built its own new factory building, producing more than 200,000 square meters of cloth every year. The factory plans to convert all the textile machines to electric this year, and the annual output will increase to 550,000 square meters, with an average of seven meters per person in the entire county.

    The county also has an agricultural machinery factory, which manufactured 56 machine tools itself in the movement of producing machine tools with machine tools in 1959. This year, it supplied 25,000 pieces of various agricultural tools and agricultural machinery to the countryside, including a large number of threshers, feed crushers, chaff cutters, and ball bearings. This year, the factory plans to supply 40,000 pieces of various agricultural tools and agricultural machinery in 230 varieties to the countryside.

    The Party Secretary of An Yue County told us that the local industry in this county only developed after the Sixth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee in June 1958. In addition to the above two factories, there are also food processing factories, paper mills, building materials factories, cotton ginning factories, daily necessities processing factories, clothing factories, and lime kilns in the county. Most of the employees in these factories are women, and some are disabled soldiers; the raw materials are completely self-reliant and locally sourced. In order to strengthen the collection of raw materials, raw material collection committees headed by the chairmen of the People's Committees have been established from the county to the village (Note 2), and the elderly and children are the main force in collecting raw materials. Various organs, factories, and enterprises also use their spare time to help collect some raw materials.

    Blooming Everywhere

    Since the Labor Party Central Committee decided to develop local industries by launching a mass movement two years ago, local industries in Korea have shown a situation of blooming everywhere. More than 1,000 factories have been newly built within six months. Now, there are more than 2,000 local industrial enterprises in northern Korea, with an average of 11 local factories in each county, and even many remote mountainous areas have factories. By the end of 1959, local industries, including production cooperatives, had increased 2.6 times in the number of factories, 8 times in the number of employees, and about 13 times in the value of output compared with 1949. By the end of August 1959, the variety of products of local industries had expanded from 1,780 at the end of June of the previous year to 3,260. The rapid development of local industries has further satisfied the people's needs for consumer goods, building materials, and agricultural tools and other industrial products.

    In August 1959, the Labor Party Central Committee decided to reorganize the industrial management system and establish a central industrial and local industrial system. The central provinces (Note 3) and bureaus reduced their institutions and extracted 20% to 30% of the cadres to be transferred to strengthen the cadre forces of local industries. The Ministry of Light Industry transferred some of its factories and enterprises to local management; each province also built some medium-sized comprehensive machine factories, iron and steel plants, cement plants, and fuel bases. In October of the same year, the Labor Party held a local industrial conference, proposing to establish and expand local industrial raw material bases, strengthen enterprise management, consolidate the technical foundation, expand varieties, and improve product quality. These measures greatly stimulated local initiative and creativity, and played a great role in the development and consolidation of local industries.

    Lin Guizhe, Chairman of the State Planning Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, told us that the vigorous development of local industries in Korea is of great significance to the development of the entire national economy and politics. The family members of workers and even all residents have participated in production and labor, and the ranks of the working class have expanded rapidly; local party and government officials have learned the knowledge of managing enterprises; local sourcing and supply have solved the tight transportation problems in the rapid development of socialist construction, and have also closely linked urban and rural relations, which is of great benefit to promoting the cultural and technical revolution in rural areas. He said that local self-reliance in developing local industries has greatly reduced the state's investment in light industry. This is an important factor in Korea's ability to complete the industrial output value plan of the first five-year plan two and a half years ahead of schedule.

    全民办地方工业
    刘云沼　周毅之
    白手起家
    赵成植同志从部队复员回来，平壤市中区党委交给他一项新工作：办一个造纸厂。上级只派任务，却没有拨给他一个技术员、一个工人、一件机器。赵成植日夜苦思，赤手空拳怎样办工厂呢？他反复研究党中央六月全会的决议。党号召展开一个全民性的运动，发展地方工业。既然要全民办工厂，当然是人人动手自己干，哪能什么都依靠上级？于是他下定决心，自己动脑筋想办法。
    赵成植跑到上级指定办厂的地方一看，原来那里有一片荒地，是个铁工厂的旧址，战时被敌人炸毁了，现在已经变成杂草丛生的废墟，附近有一些战后新盖起来的住宅。他明白了：“那荒地上的许多废铁，不就是机器吗？那附近的居民，不就是工人和技术人员吗？”
    赵成植开始进行建厂的筹备工作。他召集了一批家庭妇女，向她们解释党中央六月全会的决议，动员大家去拣废铁和砖瓦，自己造机器，盖厂房。妇女们听说要办工厂，都非常高兴，可是看见这般光景，心里不免有点怀疑：“就凭我们这些家庭妇女，能够空手在荒地上办起工厂来吗？”但是，她们又想，劳动党和金日成首相的指示是不会错的。于是大家就分头去拣废铁。这群妇女中有一个名叫金万实的姑娘，从参加建厂那天起，就变成了个“废铁迷”。她每天一大早爬起来，就立即往野地里跑，到处寻找废铁，看见一颗铁钉、一个马掌，就像发现宝贝一样，都往口袋里装。有一天，她找到一个六十斤重的旧齿轮，立即顶在头上，欢天喜地往回跑。造纸厂自己造的机器，正缺这样一个大齿轮。但是，齿轮还得加工才能用，自己又没有车床，怎么办呢？金万实想起附近有个机器厂，就又顶着齿轮去找那里的工人帮忙。当时正是年底，机器厂也在赶任务，没有时间帮助别人。金万实好歹求了半天，愿意给机器厂干双倍的粗活，和他们换工。机器厂的工人受了感动，决定加班替她切削这个大齿轮。
    英雄气概
    平壤中区造纸厂的许多机器，就是这些妇女利用她们从野地里拣回的零件和废铁制造的。她们怎样制造机器呢？当时参加建厂的人多数都没有进过工厂，只有老铁匠桂斗秀懂得一点技术，就由他领导大家造机器。他们请别的工厂代他们加工一部分零件，自己也动手制造一部分。桂斗秀用锄头的尖嘴切铁板，用铁匠炉化铁造毛坯，分给大家拿锉刀锉。他说：“在这样艰苦的时刻，我们每打一锤，锉一刀，都是表示对党和领袖的忠诚。”桂斗秀指着工厂前面的一间小屋说：“我就在那个铁匠铺里制造出这架比它大两倍的干燥炉。”
    这是1958年冬天的事。
    现在，这个日产十吨的造纸厂已经拥有五台日产三吨的造纸机、五台原料粉碎机、一架纸浆机和一个庞大的干燥炉……。厂里的工人还正在继续制造新机器，准备1960年增产一些工业用的高级纸张。
    造纸厂的两千多平方米厂房，也是这些家庭妇女盖的。修建厂房的时候正是严冬，她们都没有盖房子的经验，墙壁还没有砌到一人高就倒下来了。再砌再倒，再倒再砌，就这样反复许多次，好容易才砌起一堵墙。妇女们用背架背砖瓦，爬上房顶盖屋瓦，常常工作到深夜不回家。女工赵永顺的丈夫到工地来找她，她说：“你跨千里马，我也要跨千里马。”
    平壤中区造纸厂每天需要造纸原料十三吨，他们解决原料问题的办法也很感动人。工人们从中区卫生事务所每天运回的垃圾里，挑出40％的废物用作造纸原料。纸厂附近有许多机关、旅社和影剧院，每天都扔出大量卫生筷子（注一）、烟盒子、旧书报和糖果纸……。工人们想，这真是一个永远用不完的原料库。他们造了一批垃圾箱，送到那些地方去，每个月都收集到三十多吨造纸原料。他们还跟许多学校订合同，用新笔记本和学生们换旧笔记本，这也是一个很大的原料来源。最近他们发动了一次突击运动，工人在业余时间收集了上千吨废纸。
    郡办工业
    在朝鲜，每个郡（注二）都有一些像平壤中区造纸厂那样白手起家的地方工厂。我们访问黄海南道（注二）的时候，参观了安岳郡的地方工业。那里有一个纺织厂，完全用野生植物、棉花秆皮、篦麻秆皮、兔毛、狗毛、牛毛等作原料，纺织五十多种布匹和线衣。这个厂过去是一个规模很小的手工业生产合作社，原来只有两台织布机，厂房也是借用别人的。现在，全厂已经拥有三百八十名职工和七十五台织布机，自己还盖了新厂房，每年生产二十多万平方米布。厂里今年计划把全部纺织机都改成电动，年产量将提高到五十五万平方米，全郡平均每人分得七米。
    郡里还有一个农业机械厂，1959年在机床生产机床运动中，自己制造了五十六台机床。这一年，它供应农村各种农具和农业机械一百八十种共二万五千件，其中包括大批脱谷机、饲料粉碎机、铡草机和滚珠轴承。今年，这个厂准备供应农村各式农具和农业机械二百三十种共四万件。
    安岳郡党委员长告诉我们，这个郡的地方工业是1958年党中央六月全会以后才发展起来的。郡内除了上述两个工厂之外，还有食品加工厂、造纸厂、建筑材料厂、轧棉花工厂、日用品加工厂、被服厂和石灰窑等。这些工厂的职工大部分是妇女，一部分是残废军人；原料完全自力更生，就地取材。为了加强原料收集工作，从郡到里（注二）都成立了以人民委员会委员长为首的原料收集委员会，老人和小孩是收集原料的主力。各机关、工厂、企业也利用业余时间帮助收集一些原料。
    遍地开花
    自从前年劳动党中央六月全会决定用大搞群众运动的方法发展地方工业以来，朝鲜的地方工业出现一个遍地开花的局面，在六个月内，新建了一千多个工厂。现在，朝鲜北部共有二千多个地方工业企业，平均每个郡有十一个地方工厂，连许多偏僻的山区也都有了工厂。到1959年年底为止，包括生产合作社在内的地方工业，和1949年相比，工厂数增加到二点六倍，职工数增加到八倍，产值增加到十三倍左右。1959年8月底，地方工业的产品品种，已由前年6月底的一千七百八十种扩大到三千二百六十种。地方工业的迅速发展，进一步满足了人民对消费品、建筑材料和农具等各种工业品的需要。
    1959年8月，劳动党中央决定改组工业管理体系，建立中央工业和地方工业体系。中央的省（注三）、局缩小机构，抽出20％到30％的干部下放，加强地方工业的干部力量。轻工业省把所属的一部分工厂企业移交给地方管理；各道还分别建设了一些中等规模的综合机器厂、炼铁厂、水泥厂和燃料基地。同年10月，劳动党又召开地方工业会议，提出建立和扩大地方工业原料基地，加强企业管理，巩固技术基础，扩大品种，提高产品质量等。这些措施大大发挥了地方的积极性和创造性，对地方工业的发展和巩固具有很大作用。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国家计划委员会委员长林桂哲告诉我们，朝鲜地方工业的蓬勃发展，对整个国家经济政治的发展具有十分重大的意义。各地的职工家属甚至全体居民都参加了生产劳动，工人阶级的队伍迅速扩大了；地方党政机关工作人员学到了管理企业的知识；就地取材和供应，解决了社会主义建设高速发展中紧张的运输问题，并且还密切了城乡关系，对促进农村的文化技术革命有很大好处。他说，各地自力更生发展地方工业，大大减轻了国家对轻工业的投资。这是朝鲜能够提前两年半完成第一个五年计划的工业总产值计划的一个重要因素。
