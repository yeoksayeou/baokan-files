Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 7th. A report meeting was held in the National Art Theater in Pyongyang on the evening of February 7th by people from all walks of life in Pyongyang to commemorate the 12th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army. Attending the meeting were Korean cabinet vice premiers Hong Myung-hee, Jung Il-yong, Nam Il, Jung Joon-taek, and Lee Joo-yeon, Vice Chairmen of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party Kim Chang-man and Lee Jong-ok, Standing Committee members Lee Hyo-soon and Lim Hae, and other Korean party and government leaders, Korean People's Army generals and officers, and foreign envoys and military attachés to North Korea.

    General Kim Chang-bong, Chief of the General Staff of the Korean People's Army, delivered a report at the meeting. He said that the Korean people now have a regular Korean People's Army, including the Navy, Army and Air Force, equipped with modern technology. They are an army under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party that safeguards the interests and happiness of the people and defends the victory of the motherland and socialism.

    He also pointed out that the Chinese People's Volunteers completely and voluntarily withdrew from Korea in October 1958. However, the US imperialists have tried every possible means to oppose the peaceful reunification of Korea, and violated the Korean Armistice Agreement before the ink was dry, shipping large quantities of new weapons such as atomic weapons and missile weapons into South Korea, and expanded the Lee Syngman puppet army to twice its size at the time of the armistice. US imperialism must immediately withdraw from South Korea with the atomic and missile weapons it has illegally brought into South Korea.

    He emphasized that the US imperialists must know that any military adventure against any country in the socialist camp, including Korea, will never succeed, but will only bring about their own tragic demise. He said that the Korean people will continue to fight resolutely for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and will never allow any enemy's conspiracy to disrupt peace.

    平壤各界集会纪念建军节
    金昌凤要美帝国主义立即撤出南朝鲜
    新华社平壤7日电　平壤市各界人民7日晚上在国立艺术剧场举行报告会，纪念朝鲜人民军建军十二周年。参加大会的有朝鲜内阁副首相洪命熹、郑一龙、南日、郑准泽、李周渊，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长金昌满、李钟玉，常务委员李孝淳、林海等朝鲜党政领导人和朝鲜人民军将领、军官以及各国驻朝鲜使节和武官等。
    朝鲜人民军总参谋长金昌凤中将在会上作了报告。他说，朝鲜人民现在有了以现代化技术装备起来的、包括海陆空军的、正规的朝鲜人民军。他们是一支在朝鲜劳动党领导下的维护人民利益和幸福，保卫祖国和社会主义胜利果实的军队。
    他还指出，中国人民志愿军在1958年10月全部主动地从朝鲜撤走。但是，美帝国主义者却千方百计地反对朝鲜的和平统一，在朝鲜停战协定签字的墨迹未干时就违反了它，向南朝鲜运入了大量的原子武器、导弹武器等新式武器，并把李伪军扩大到停战当时的两倍。美帝国主义必须立即带着非法运入南朝鲜的原子和导弹武器立即从南朝鲜撤走。
    他强调说，美帝国主义者必须知道它反对包括朝鲜在内的社会主义阵营的任何国家的军事冒险都绝不能成功，反而只能给自己带来自取灭亡的悲惨的结果。他说，朝鲜人民将为和平统一祖国继续坚决斗争，并且绝不容许敌人的任何扰乱和平的阴谋。
