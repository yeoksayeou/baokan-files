Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 3rd - The modernized Jilin Fertilizer Plant, having mobilized its workforce to vigorously pursue technological innovation, has achieved the equivalent of turning one factory into three with only a small increase in equipment. Since December of last year, the production of eight products, including ammonium nitrate, synthetic ammonia, methanol, and formaldehyde, has consistently exceeded the original designed capacity by two times.

Since launching a mass technological innovation movement in 1958, the plant has implemented over 20,000 innovative suggestions, leading to a continuous increase in production. In early 1958, the plant's Party committee led the workforce in a technological innovation campaign focused on fully tapping the potential of equipment and increasing equipment utilization rates, resulting in an average capacity increase of about 50% over the original design for over 90% of the plant's main equipment. Simultaneously, the plant also partially utilized previously spare and idle equipment by strengthening technical management and improving labor organization. Thus, by the fourth quarter of 1958, the plant had increased its production capacity by one time with the addition of just one compressor, with the monthly average production of the main product, chemical fertilizer ammonium nitrate, reaching 201% of the original designed capacity. Last year, the workers further tapped significant potential in existing equipment and implemented many complex and difficult technological innovations that improved process conditions, changed production flows, and reformed equipment, increasing the production capacity of major workshops such as steam generation, copper washing, synthesis, and nitric acid by 30% to 100% on the basis of the leap forward in 1958. As a result, the plant only added a few fixed-bed steam generators and compressors, increasing the plant's production capacity by two times compared to the original design capacity. In December of last year, the actual production of chemical fertilizer ammonium nitrate had increased to 307% of the original designed capacity. In 1959, the plant's labor productivity increased by 48% compared to 1958, and by 220% compared to 1957; the total cost in 1959 decreased by 17% compared to 1958, and by 49.53% compared to 1957.

Strengthening political and ideological work, extensively mobilizing the masses, and simultaneously organizing the masses with meticulous and solid organizational work are the primary guarantees for the victorious development of the Jilin Fertilizer Plant's technological innovation movement. In terms of political and ideological work, they not only used various forms such as report meetings, airing views meetings, debates, and big-character posters and blackboards to break the superstition that technological innovation movements could not be carried out in modern chemical industries, but also led the workforce to continuously climb technical peaks along the path from small to large, from indigenous to foreign, and from points to areas. More than 3,000 workers who originally did not understand chemical technology participated in technological innovation activities. In terms of organizational work, they established a plant-wide technological innovation research network to transform scattered, sporadic technological innovation activities into a regular mass movement with leadership and organization. This technological innovation research network consists of 107 technological innovation research groups distributed in various workshops and sections of the plant. These technological innovation research groups are fully adapted to the production organization and carry out activities around production tasks. Each technological innovation research group takes the workshop Party branch as the core leading force, promoting technological innovation with political work, thus combining political work with technical work. The technological innovation group is composed of leading cadres, production workers, and dedicated technicians from the workshop and section, applying and developing the principle of "three-way combination", transforming the combination of cadres, workers, and technical personnel from a temporary and unfixed working method into a fixed organizational form, forming an organized technical force. The workers praised this force as "better than Zhuge Liang and surpassing engineers". Relying on this force, the plant overcame more than 200 major technical barriers in 1959. For example, the bottom of the fluidized bed steam generator in the plant's steam generation workshop originally used dry ash discharge, which often required shutdown for maintenance, and the equipment operating rate was only 81.7%. After a year of research by the technological innovation group, it was transformed into automatic hydraulic ash discharge, reducing maintenance time and increasing the equipment operating rate to more than 97%, greatly enhancing steam generation capacity. The nitric acid workshop has implemented more than 50 technological innovations in the past year, increasing the capacity of the oxidation furnace by 53%, the capacity of the ice machine by 33%, and the capacity of the oxygen compressor by 10%, breaking the superstition that some people believed that the potential of the oxidation furnace, ice machine, and oxygen compressor had been exhausted.

    大型企业技术革新发挥了巨大威力
    吉林肥料厂生产能力提高两倍
    据新华社长春3日电　现代化的吉林肥料厂，发动职工群众大搞技术革新，在增加少量设备的条件下，实现了一厂变三厂。从去年12月份以来，硝酸铵、合成氨、甲醇、甲醛等八种产品的生产，已经稳定地超过原设计能力两倍。
    这个厂从1958年开展群众性技术革新运动到现在，已经实现了两万多项革新建议，全厂生产不断上升。1958年初，工厂党委就领导职工群众开展了以充分挖掘设备潜力、提高设备利用率为中心的技术革新运动，使全厂百分之九十以上的主要设备能力，比原设计提高百分之五十左右。同时，全厂还通过加强技术管理和改善劳动组织，把原来备用和闲置的设备部分地利用起来。这样，到1958年第四季度，全厂就在增加一台压缩机的条件下，生产能力提高了一倍，主要产品化学肥料硝酸铵的月平均产量达到了原设计能力201％。去年，职工们又在原有设备中挖掘出了很大潜力，并且实现了许多改善工艺条件、改变生产流程、改革设备等复杂困难的技术革新，使造汽、铜洗、合成、硝酸等主要车间的生产能力，在1958年跃进的基础上分别提高百分之三十到一倍。这样，只增加数台固定层造汽炉和压缩机，就使全厂生产能力比原设计能力提高了两倍。去年12月份，化学肥料硝酸铵的实际产量已经提高到原设计能力的307％。全厂1959年劳动生产率比1958年提高48％，比1957年提高220％；1959年总成本比1958年下降17％，比1957年下降49．53％。
    加强政治思想工作，广泛发动群众，同时以细致扎实的组织工作把群众力量组织起来，是吉林肥料厂技术革新运动胜利发展的首要保证。在政治思想工作方面，他们不仅用报告会、鸣放会、辩论会和大字报、黑板报等多种形式，破除对于现代化学工业不能开展技术革新运动的迷信，同时沿着由小到大、由土到洋、由点到面的途径，领导职工群众不断地攀登技术高峰，三千多名原来不懂化工技术的工人都参加了技术革新活动。在组织工作方面，他们建立了全厂性的技术革新研究网，把分散的突击性的技术革新活动变成有领导有组织的经常性的群众运动。这种技术革新研究网，由分布在全厂各车间、各工段的一百零七个技术革新研究组组成。这些技术革新研究组与生产组织完全相适应，围绕生产任务进行活动。每个技术革新研究组，以车间党支部为核心领导力量，以政治工作推动技术革新，这样就把政治工作与技术工作结合起来。技术革新组由车间和工段的领导干部、生产工人、专责技术员三部分人组成，应用和发展了“三结合”的原则，使干部、工人、技术人员的结合由临时的不固定的工作方式变成固定的组织形式，形成了有组织的技术力量。工人们称赞这批力量“赛过诸葛亮，胜过工程师”。依靠这批力量，1959年全厂攻破了二百多项重大的技术关。例如：这个厂造汽车间沸腾层造汽炉炉底，原来是干式下灰，经常要停炉检修，设备运转率只有81．7％，经过技术革新组一年来的研究，改造为自动水力排灰，减少了检修时间，使设备运转率提高到97％以上，大大增强了造汽能力。硝酸车间一年来实现了五十多项技术革新，使氧化炉的能力增加53％，冰机的能力增加33％，氧气压缩机的能力增加10％，打破了有些人认为氧化炉、冰机、氧气压缩机潜力挖光的迷信。
