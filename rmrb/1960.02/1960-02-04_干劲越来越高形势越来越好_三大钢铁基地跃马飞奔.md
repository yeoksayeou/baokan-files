Xinhua News Agency, Anshan Dispatch Anshan Iron and Steel Company (An'gang) saw many of its factories and mines achieve production levels on February 1st that significantly exceeded those of January.

On February 1st, all thirteen steel rolling mills of An'gang surpassed their daily production plans. The actual output increased by 36.6% compared to the average daily production level in January, setting a new daily production record for this year. Workers in large rolling mills vigorously engaged in competitions, increasing steel rail production by 282 tons on February 1st alone.

Steelworkers at open-hearth furnaces and blast furnaces applied their past production experience to push steel production to new heights on February 1st. The Third Steelmaking Plant of An'gang, despite one open-hearth furnace being under repair, overfulfilled its daily production plan by 0.7%, with the daily production level increasing by more than 3% compared to the average in January.

Workers in raw material and fuel production factories and mines, such as the mining, sintering, and chemical plants, did everything possible to increase output and improve quality to support steelmaking, ironmaking, and steel rolling production.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan Dispatch Wuhan Iron and Steel Company (Wu'gang) achieved an all-round victory in production in January, with steel, iron, coke, and ore production all overfulfilling their production plans. According to statistics, steel production exceeded the plan by 5.9%, pig iron production exceeded the plan by 0.02%, coke production exceeded the plan by 3.5%, and ore production also greatly exceeded the plan. Compared with December of last year, the average daily output in January increased by 8.57% for steel and 12.67% for coke. Product quality was good.

Since the beginning of the new year, Wu'gang, on the basis of the double leap forward in production and capital construction last year, has widely promoted the advanced experiences of the Daye Steel Plant in organizing "key problem tackling campaigns" and the An'gang technical performance competitions, making the increase production and practice economy movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution even more lively and vigorous. The steelmaking plant adopted a combination of key problem tackling and on-site demonstrations to solve key production problems, greatly shortening the smelting time. The time to charge a batch of materials into a 500-ton open-hearth furnace, which used to be at least two hours, has now been reduced to forty-five minutes.

Xinhua News Agency, Baotou Dispatch Baotou Iron and Steel Company (Bao'gang) achieved a double "red start" in both production and construction in January. Steel production fulfilled the monthly plan one to two days ahead of schedule, coke and ore production fulfilled the monthly plan four to four and a half days ahead of schedule, and capital construction fulfilled the monthly plan four days ahead of schedule.

Since January, Bao'gang workers have been deeply carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement on both the production and capital construction fronts. The production department, centered on the large blast furnace, has carried out a one-stop large-scale collaboration competition for high yield, high quality, low consumption, and safety, ensuring that raw materials support ironmaking, ironmaking supports steelmaking, and transportation and power support production, linking one link to another. Workers at the Bao'gang Ironmaking Plant vigorously improved tuyeres, slag notches, etc., increasing the average daily output in January by more than 20% compared to December of last year. Workers in the capital construction department self-reliantly produced wet-ground slag concrete, saving a total of 923 tons of cement in January.

    干劲越来越高形势越来越好
    三大钢铁基地跃马飞奔
    据新华社鞍山电　鞍钢许多厂矿2月1日的生产水平都大大超过了1月份。
    2月1日这天，鞍钢十三个轧钢厂生产的钢材都超过当天计划，实际产量比1月份的平均日产水平增长36．6％，创今年以来最高日产新纪录。大型轧钢厂各班职工大搞竞赛，2月1日一天全厂就增产钢轨二百八十二吨。
    平炉、高炉的钢铁职工，运用过去的生产经验，2月1日也把钢铁的生产水平推向了新的高峰。鞍钢第三炼钢厂在一座平炉检修的情况下，超额0．7％完成了当天的生产计划，日产水平比1月份平均提高3％以上。
    矿山、烧结和化工总厂等原料、燃料生产厂矿职工，为了支援炼钢、炼铁和轧钢生产，都千方百计地增加产量和提高质量。
    据新华社武汉电　武汉钢铁公司1月份生产夺得了满堂红，钢、铁、焦炭、矿石都超额完成了生产计划。据统计，钢产量超过计划5．9％，生铁产量超过计划0．02％，焦炭产量超过计划3．5％，矿石产量也大大超过计划。1月份的平均日产量和去年12月相比，钢和焦炭分别提高8．57％和12．67％。产品质量良好。
    新年以来，武钢在去年生产、基建双跃进的基础上，普遍推广了大冶钢厂组织“攻关战役”和鞍钢技术表演赛等先进经验，使以技术革新、技术革命为中心的增产节约运动更加生动活泼。炼钢厂采取攻关和现场表演相结合的方法，解决生产关键问题，大大缩短了冶炼时间。五百吨平炉装一炉料的时间，过去最短要两小时，现在缩短到四十五分钟。
    据新华社包头电　包头钢铁公司1月份的生产和建设双双实现开门红。钢铁产量提前一天到两天完成了月计划，焦炭和矿石产量提前四天到四天半完成了月计划，基本建设提前四天完成了月计划。
    1月份以来，包钢职工在生产和基本建设两条战线上，深入地开展了增产节约运动。生产部门在以大高炉为中心，开展高产、优质、低耗、保安全的一条龙大协作竞赛中，做到了原料保炼铁、炼铁保炼钢、运输和动力保生产，一环扣一环。包钢炼铁厂职工大力改进风口、渣口等，使1月份的平均日产量比去年12月份提高20％以上。基本建设部门的职工自力更生地生产湿碾渣混凝土，1月份一共节约水泥九百二十三吨。
