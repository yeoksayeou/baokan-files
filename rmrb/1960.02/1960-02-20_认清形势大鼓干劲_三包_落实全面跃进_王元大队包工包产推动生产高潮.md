    Editor's Note: Today’s *People's Daily* publication of the news about the implementation of the "Three Guarantees" by the Wang Yuan Brigade of the Da Bu Commune in Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, proves that implementing production target, labor quota and financial expenditure plans for the contracting units is a key link in further mobilizing the masses and doing a good job in spring plowing. Now, the busy season of spring plowing is approaching. Areas where the "Three Guarantees" have not yet been implemented should quickly submit the production plan to the masses for discussion and implement the plan to the contracting units as soon as possible; areas where the "Three Guarantees" have already been implemented should strike while the iron is hot, further mobilize the masses to carry out the movement to increase production and income, and better organize the enthusiasm and drive of the masses into the current spring plowing production movement.
    
    (Our report) The Wang Yuan Brigade of the Da Bu Commune in Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, through mobilizing the masses to speak out and debate, summarizing the great leap forward in production in 1959, analyzing the excellent situation in 1960, arranging for the whole year's production, and implementing the "Three Guarantees" plan, has powerfully promoted the current production upsurge.

    Recognizing the Situation, Unifying Thinking

    The agricultural production of this brigade in 1959 achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The per-mu yield of grain was 1,236 jin, an increase of one-fold over 1958; cotton and oil crops also increased by more than one-fold. The facts of the bumper harvest opened the eyes of the members, liberated their thinking, and made them determined to achieve a better and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960.

    The brigade Party branch, by summing up the experience of the 1959 leap forward, mobilized the masses, analyzed the situation, and presented favorable conditions, further improving the understanding of the masses. After a comprehensive analysis, everyone realized that the situation in 1959 was very good, and there were many favorable conditions for realizing a better and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960: (1) Under the correct leadership of the Party, especially after the implementation of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, cadres and the masses clarified the direction of struggle, everyone was full of spirit, and everyone was full of vigor. (2) In 1959, many high-yield models emerged, setting up banners and providing rich experience. (3) The entire team has realized river networking and water conservancy, and all land can be generally irrigated once every three days. (4) Due to the continuous great leap forward in the past two years, the experience of leading the great leap forward has become richer. (5) The pig raising industry has developed at a high speed, with 6,400 pigs currently raised, an increase of twelve-fold compared to 1958; each team has established a local fertilizer plant, which provides conditions for increasing the application of high-quality fertilizer. (6) Major reforms in production, breeding, and cooking tools, continuous expansion of mechanized farming area, and corresponding increase in strong and fat cattle and horses have effectively improved labor efficiency, making it possible to turn insufficient labor into surplus. (7) The team currently has more than 15,000 yuan of working capital, which is also more abundant than in previous years.

    While analyzing the favorable conditions, the members were also mobilized to analyze the difficult conditions and find ways to overcome them. According to everyone's analysis, the scope of production in 1960 is broad, the tasks are large, and the requirements are high. The main difficulty is the lack of labor. In order to overcome this difficulty, it was determined to focus on grasping tool reform and improving labor management, and many specific measures were proposed.

    Taking Grain as the Key Link, Comprehensively Arranging Production

    On the basis of recognizing the situation, improving thinking, and strengthening confidence in continuing the leap forward, the annual planting plan and production targets were specifically studied. According to the requirements of taking grain as the key link, comprehensively leaping forward in grain, cotton, and oil, and comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, cadres and the masses were mobilized to arrange this year's production in light of the experience and lessons of crop planting in 1959. In the arrangement, attention was paid to grasping the following points: under the guidance of the national plan, comprehensively considering the needs of the state, the collective, and the members, and making reasonable arrangements; looking ahead and behind, planting according to local conditions, and arranging according to the field, fertilizer, and previous crops; on the premise of adapting to local conditions, the arrangement of crops planted by teams should be closely combined with large-area high-yield methods, and planting should be done in as many continuous pieces as possible, and in separate areas, so as to facilitate unified management; appropriately expand the planting area of spring sweet potatoes to solve the contradiction between late autumn crops and autumn-sown wheat; according to planting habits and the rules of crop rotation, intercropping, interplanting, and continuous cropping should be implemented to improve land utilization and expand the multiple cropping index; appropriately expand the planting area of sweet potatoes and corn to meet the feed needs of the rapidly developing pig industry; drought-prone crops (such as corn, millet, etc.) should be arranged near ditches and rivers to facilitate irrigation and save labor. According to the above principles, the planting area of various crops such as grain, cotton, and oil was specifically arranged. And according to the production base in 1959 and the production conditions in 1960, the yield targets for various crops were set. Grain crops accounted for 4,305 mu, with a mixed per-mu yield of 2,500 jin, an increase of one-fold compared to 1959; cotton accounted for 500 mu, with a per-mu yield of 350 jin of seed cotton, an increase of 90% compared to 1959; oil crops accounted for 277 mu, with a per-mu yield of 800 jin, an increase of 1.29-fold compared to 1959.

    "Six Fixes" to Teams, Reasonable Allocation

    After the production targets were set, the "Three Guarantees" work was immediately carried out. First, according to the changes in the situation of land, labor, livestock, and farm tools between small teams over the past year, before the "Three Guarantees," the brigade reasonably handled various specific problems before the "Three Guarantees" through "Six Fixes" for the production teams: (1) Fix the size of the team. The existing thirteen teams are of a size that is convenient for leadership and for implementing contracting output to teams, and will not be changed. In terms of labor, a general ranking was conducted, and all 628 laborers, except for those occupied by the industrial and professional production run by the commune and the brigade, were allocated and used by the small teams. (2) Fix the land. The production brigade organized a special organization to reasonably adjust the land. The principle to be followed is: first, the land of the original small team is still the basis, generally not moving, with individual adjustments; second, according to the natural situation of river networking, planning should be done as much as possible to facilitate mechanized farming; third, taking into account the distance of the land and the different soil qualities, the wheat fields and spring fields should be different; fourth, the area of cultivated land borne by each laborer in each team should be basically balanced; fifth, thoroughly eliminate the scattered plots of land between teams. According to the above principles, the cultivated areas were divided and fixed to each small team. (3) Fix livestock and farm tools. According to the brigade's 1960 livestock development plan and the spirit of basically balancing the cultivated land borne by each livestock, the livestock originally fixed to the small teams generally remained unchanged. For teams with individual livestock shortages, reasonable solutions were provided according to the specific situation. Farm tools that have been evenly distributed will no longer be adjusted; small farm tools are still provided by the members themselves. (4) Fix crop planting. According to the planting tasks assigned by the state and the commune, combined with the actual situation of each small team, the planting area of grain, cotton, and oil crops was allocated to the production teams. In the distribution of planting tasks, the following was achieved: adapting to local conditions, appropriately taking care of the stubble, and planning planting according to the direction; appropriately allocating more economic crops to poor teams to increase their income. (5) Fix measures. According to the 1960 production plan and the yield targets for high-yield fields, abundant fields, and general fields, different measures plans were made and reviewed and approved by the members' representative assembly. (6) Fix the distribution.

    Promoting Democracy, Implementing the "Three Guarantees"

    After the "Six Fixes," the "Three Guarantees" plan was formulated through full democratic discussion, and the guarantee of output, labor, and finance was promptly implemented to the small teams.

    1. Guarantee of Output. The determination of output targets is mainly based on the output base in 1959 and the production conditions and soil quality in 1960, so that the output targets are both active and reliable, and there is room for surplus, and there is production to exceed and rewards to be obtained. Due to the changes in natural conditions this year, the following issues were addressed in the guarantee of output:

    Measures for guaranteeing output for reclaiming wasteland at the head of the village: For wasteland reclamation tasks that are uniformly planned by the brigade, the guarantee of output is carried out according to soil conditions; for those reclaimed by the production team themselves, the guarantee of output is not carried out in the first year, and the team plants them themselves, and the income belongs to the team, and the guarantee of output begins in the second year. For teams with particularly large differences in water conservancy conditions (such as self-flowing irrigation and water lifting, upstream and downstream), the guarantee of output targets was appropriately increased or decreased after democratic evaluation. According to the above methods, the entire brigade divided the thirteen production teams into three categories and guaranteed output by crop.

    2. Guarantee of Labor. According to the labor quotas in 1959, referring to the changes in soil quality, tools, and natural conditions in 1960, the guarantee of labor was calculated by crop, and the number of labor for livestock breeding and collective manure accumulation was added together, which is the agricultural guarantee of labor for each production team. The number of labor for other collective welfare undertakings such as canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and homes for the elderly, and miscellaneous work, were democratically evaluated and determined for the whole year based on the actual number of labor used and the actual needs in 1960. The labor for basic construction, except for the basic construction projects within the scope of the brigade, which are recorded by the brigade according to quotas, other labor such as repairing cattle sheds and building pig pens is contracted by the brigade to the small teams.

    With the development of production, the use of labor will often break through the scope of the small teams in the future, so labor cooperation will become an important organizational form in future production. According to this situation, it is determined that when organizing cooperation between small teams to complete tasks that meet the common needs of the entire brigade (such as repairing branch canals, fighting canals, repairing roads, etc.), labor will be drawn in proportion to the amount of labor in each small team, recorded and distributed by the brigade, and uniformly participate in the brigade's distribution; cooperation between small teams will calculate work point rewards based on the principle of equivalent exchange.

    3. Guarantee of Finance. According to the principle of running the commune diligently and thriftily, at the same time as guaranteeing labor and output, the finance is guaranteed to the end at one time. Agricultural financial expenditures are divided into two types: one is basic expenditure, such as seeds, pesticides, fertilizers, etc., which are contracted to the small team according to the needs of various crop technical operation regulations. The second is auxiliary expenditure, such as farm tool repair costs, livestock feed and fodder, veterinary expenses for livestock, and small team office expenses, which are reasonably contracted to each team according to the fixed amount of financial contracting. After the financial contracting to the team, the contracting unit is responsible for overspending, and the surplus is owned and managed by the team itself. In addition, reward and punishment measures were further determined.

    After the guarantee of labor and output was completed, the brigade Party branch adopted the method of brigade cadres contracting to teams to strengthen specific leadership in order to lead the contracting units and members to actively complete and overfulfill the contracting tasks. Help the small teams continue to improve production management, mobilize each small team and members to make plans for increasing production and income, and launch a red flag competition between teams, groups, and people. At present, the spring plowing movement and the management of wheat greening have been enthusiastically launched throughout the brigade.

    认清形势大鼓干劲  “三包”落实全面跃进
    王元大队包工包产推动生产高潮
    编者按：本报今天发表的山东寿张县大布公社王元大队“三包”落实的消息证明，把农业生产的产量指标、用工数量和财务开支计划落实到包产单位，是进一步发动群众，搞好春耕生产的主要环节。现在，春耕大忙季节就将来到。“三包”还没有落实的地区，应该赶紧把生产计划交给群众讨论，尽快地把计划落实到包产单位；“三包”已经落实的地区，应该趁热打铁，进一步发动群众开展超产增收运动，把群众的热情和干劲更好地组织到当前的春耕生产运动中来。
    本报讯　山东寿张县大布公社王元大队，通过发动群众鸣放辩论，在总结1959年生产大跃进的基础上，分析1960年的大好形势，安排了全年生产，落实了“三包”计划，有力地促进了当前的生产高潮。
    认清形势　统一思想
    这个大队1959年的农业生产，获得了空前的大丰收。粮食亩产一千二百三十六斤，较1958年增长一倍；棉花、油料作物也增产一倍以上。丰收的事实，打开了社员的眼界，解放了思想，决心在1960年实现更好更全面的跃进。
    大队党支部通过总结1959年跃进经验，发动群众，分析形势，摆有利条件，进一步提高了群众的认识。经过全面分析，大家认识到1959年形势很好，实现1960年更好更全面跃进的有利条件很多：（1）在党的正确领导下，特别是贯彻执行党的八届八中全会决议后，干部和群众明确了奋斗方向，人人意气风发，个个干劲十足。（2）1959年涌现出许多高额丰产典型，树立了旗帜，提供了丰富的经验。
  （3）全队实现了河网化、水利化，全部土地三天能够普浇一遍水。（4）由于连续两年大跃进，领导大跃进的经验更加丰富。（5）养猪业高速度发展，现养猪六千四百头，较1958年增长十二倍；每个小队都建立了土化肥场，这给增施优质肥料提供了条件。（6）生产、饲养、炊事工具大改革，机耕面积不断扩大，肥牛壮马也相应增加，这一切，都有效地提高了劳动效率，有条件使劳力不足变有余。（7）全队现有周转资金一万五千多元，也比往年雄厚。
    在分析有利条件的同时，还发动社员分析了困难条件，并想办法克服困难。据大家分析，1960年生产范围广，任务大，要求高，最主要的困难是劳力不足。为了克服这一困难，确定突出抓住工具改革和改进劳动管理，并且提出了许多具体措施。
    以粮为纲  全面安排生产
    在认清形势，提高思想，坚定继续跃进信心的基础上，具体研究了全年种植计划和生产指标。根据以粮为纲，粮、棉、油全面跃进，农林牧副渔全面发展的要求，发动干部和群众，对照1959年作物种植的经验教训，安排了今年的生产。在安排中，注意掌握了以下几点：在国家计划指导下，统筹兼顾国家、集体、社员三者的需要，合理安排；瞻前顾后，因地种植，看田、看肥、看前茬作物进行安排；在因地制宜的前提下，队与队种植作物的安排要与大面积丰产方密切结合起来，尽可能连片成方，分方种植，以便统一管理；适当扩大春红薯的种植面积，解决晚秋作物和秋种小麦的矛盾；根据种植习惯和调茬轮作的规律，实行间作、套作、连作，提高土地利用率，扩大复种指数；适当扩大红薯、玉米播种面积，以适应高速发展生猪的饲料需要；易旱作物（如玉米、谷子等），安排在沟渠河道附近，使灌溉方便，节省劳力。根据以上原则，具体安排了粮食、棉花、油料等各项作物的种植面积。并根据1959年的生产基础和1960年的生产条件，订出各类作物的产量指标。粮食作物四千三百零五亩，混合单产二千五百斤，较1959年增长一倍；棉花五百亩，单产籽棉三百五十斤，较1959年增长90％；油料作物二百七十七亩，单产八百斤，较1959年增长一点二九倍。
    “六定”到队　合理搭配
    生产指标订出后，随即进行了“三包”工作。首先，根据一年来小队与小队之间，土地、劳力、牲口、农具情况的变化，在“三包”前，大队对生产小队通过“六定”，合理处理了“三包”前的各项具体问题：（一）定队的规模。现有的十三个队的规模，便于领导，便于实行包工包产，不再变动。在劳力方面，普遍进行了一次排队，除公社、大队经营的工业专业性生产所占用的劳力外，其余六百二十八名劳力，一律由小队调配使用。（二）定土地。生产大队组织了专门的组织，合理调整土地。掌握的原则：一是仍以原小队的土地为基础，一般不动，个别调整；二是根据河网化的自然形势，尽可能地规划成方，以便于机耕；三是照顾到土地远近，土质不同，麦田、春田茬口不同；四是使各队每个劳力负担耕地面积基本平衡；五是彻底消灭队与队之间的插花地。根据以上原则，划分了耕作区，固定到各小队。（三）定牲口、农具。根据大队1960年牲口的发展规划和每头牲口负担耕地基本平衡的精神，原固定到小队的牲口一般不动，对个别缺牲口的队，分别情况，合理解决。农具已均衡搭配的，不再调整；小农具仍归社员自备。（四）定作物种植。根据国家、公社分配的种植任务，结合各小队的实际情况，把粮、棉、油料作物的种植面积分配到生产小队。在分配种植任务中做到：因地制宜、适当照顾茬口，按方规划种植；对穷队适当多搭配经济作物，使其多收入。（五）定措施。根据1960年的生产规划和高额丰产田、丰产田和一般田的产量指标，作出不同的措施计划，并经社员代表大会审查定案。（六）定分配。
    发扬民主  “三包”落实
    “六定”之后，即通过充分的民主讨论，订出“三包”方案，及时将包产、包工、包财务落实到小队。
    一、包产。确定包产指标，主要根据1959年的产量基础和1960年的生产条件及土质好坏，做到产量指标既积极可靠，又留有余地，有产可超，有奖可得。由于今年自然条件的变化，在包产中注意解决了以下问题：
    对开垦村头荒地的包产办法：凡属大队统一规划的开荒任务，根据土质条件进行包产；生产小队自行开垦的，第一年不包产，由小队自行种植，收入归队，第二年开始包产。对个别水利条件好坏（如自流灌溉与提水，上游与下游）悬殊过大的队，经过民主评议，适当增减包产指标。根据以上办法，全大队把十三个生产小队划分为三类，分作物进行包产。
    二、包工。根据1959年的劳动定额，参照1960年土质、工具、自然条件的变化情况，分作物计算包工，把牲畜饲养、集体积肥的用工数加在一起，就是各生产小队的农业包工数。其他食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院等集体福利事业用工和杂工，根据常年实际用工数和1960年的实际需要，民主评定出全年的包工数。基本建设用工，除大队范围内的基本建设工程由大队按定额记工外，其他如修牛棚、打猪圈等用工由大队包工到小队。
    随着生产的发展，今后劳力运用常会突破小队的范围，因而劳动协作将成为今后生产中的重要组织形式。根据这一情况，确定凡是以大队为单位，完成全大队共同需要的任务（如修支渠、斗渠、修公路等）组织小队与小队之间的协作时，根据各小队劳力多少比例抽调，由大队记工分，统一参加大队分配；小队与小队之间的协作，根据等价交换的原则，计算工分报酬。
    三、包财务。根据勤俭办社的原则，在包工包产的同时，把财务一次包死。农业财务开支分两种：一是基本开支，如种子、农药、肥料等，按照各类作物技术操作规程的需要，包干到小队。二是辅助开支，如农具修理费、牲口饲草饲料、耕畜医疗费、小队办公费用等，按财务包干定额，合理包到各队。财务包干到队后，超支由承包单位负责，节余归队自理。此外，并进一步确定了奖惩办法。
    包工包产结束后，大队党支部为领导承包单位和社员积极完成和超额完成承包任务，采取了大队干部分队包干办法，加强具体领导。帮助小队继续改进生产管理，发动各小队和社员普遍作出增产增收计划，展开队与队、组与组、人与人的红旗竞赛。目前，全大队的备耕运动和小麦返青管理已热烈展开。
