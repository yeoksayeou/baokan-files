New Developments in Spring Plowing

　　Moving Seedling Fields for Consolidated Management

The Liyuan People's Commune in Yizhang County, Hunan Province, in the cultivation of rice seedlings, has changed the past habit of scattered seedling cultivation based on the new situation of the commune's large-scale production. They have adopted the method of consolidating seedling fields, specialized management, batch sowing, and unified management to carry out the work of leveling seedling fields and selecting and cultivating seedlings. At present, the entire commune generally uses the production team as the unit to uniformly plan the seedling field area, selecting places with sunny, sheltered, and good water conservancy conditions to establish eighty-three seedling field bases, each generally with forty to fifty mu.

The centralized and consolidated management of seedling fields in the Liyuan Commune was proposed based on summarizing last year's bumper harvest experience and the commune's production characteristics. Last year, the grain here achieved a bumper harvest with an average yield of more than 770 jin per mu, but the increase in production was uneven, with the increase in production of mountain production teams being relatively small. The reason was that the temperature in the mountains was low, and the seedlings were cultivated late and transplanted late. Therefore, this year, the Party committee fully promoted the superiority of the commune's “large scale and high degree of public ownership,” and put forward the call of "moving seedling fields and consolidating management." Generally, each place establishes seed selection stations and seedling field bases with the production team as the unit, but the brigades uniformly plan and mutually adjust. In this way, seedling fields in mountainous areas and areas with poor water sources have been moved to plain areas. The contradiction that seedling cultivation could not keep up with the season in previous years has been resolved.

The centralized and consolidated seedling fields, with specialized management, first and foremost, facilitates the universal and appropriate advancement of the sowing and seedling cultivation season, to achieve the goal of common increase in production in mountainous and plain areas. At present, the first batch of early rice seedlings from all sixteen mountain production teams in the commune are being cultivated in borrowed fields by production teams in the plain areas. Here, a spirit of communist cooperation prevails everywhere. For example, the first production team of the Kuzhu Brigade is in a high mountain area, and the second production team in the plain area took the initiative to help them prepare twelve mu of seedling fields; while the second production team helped the first production team prepare more than seventy mu of dry land and accumulate more than 1,200 dan of fertilizer in the mountains. Such equivalent exchange and mutual cooperation have enabled everyone to improve production.

Secondly, it facilitates planned sowing and batch seedling cultivation to regulate labor and better connect the preceding and following crops.

Thirdly, it facilitates the implementation of new seedling cultivation techniques. At present, each seed selection station in the seedling field base has prepared triangular continuous stoves for warm water seed selection, prepared medicines such as salt, formalin, and Ceresan for seed selection and disinfection, all seeds have been treated to remove barnyard grass, and more than 300 specialized seed selection and seedling cultivation personnel have been trained to master these new techniques.

Finally, the centralized and consolidated seedling fields, with unified management, can greatly save labor. When seedling cultivation was scattered last year, the entire commune needed more than 1,100 people to be responsible for managing the seedling fields, but now, with unified water management, only 312 experienced farmers are needed.

    秧田搬家　成片经营
    湖南省宜章县栗源人民公社在水稻育秧中，根据公社大生产的新形势，改变过去分散育秧的习惯，采取秧田成片、专业经营、分批播种、统一管理的办法，开展平整秧田和选种育秧工作。现在，全社一般以生产队为单位统一规划秧田区，选择向阳背风、水利条件好的地方，建立了八十三个秧田基地，一般每个秧田基地有四、五十亩。
    栗源公社集中成片经营秧田，是在总结去年丰产经验和公社生产特点的基础上提出的。去年这里的粮食获得平均亩产七百七十多斤的大丰收，但是增产不平衡，山地生产队增产幅度较小。原因是：山地气温低，秧苗育得迟，插得晚。因此今年党委会充分发扬公社一大二公的优越性，提出了“秧田搬家、成片经营”的号召。各地一般以生产队为单位建立选种站和秧田基地，但是由大队统一规划，互相调剂。这样山地和水源不好的地区，秧田都搬到平原地区来了。往年育秧赶不上季节的矛盾就解决了。
    秧田集中成片，专业经营，首先是便于普遍适当地提早播种育秧季节，以达到山区平原共同增产的目的。现在，全社十六个山地生产队第一批早稻秧苗都在平原地区生产队借田育秧。在这里，到处洋溢着共产主义协作精神。例如，苦竹大队第一生产队在高山地区，平原地区的第二生产队就主动帮助他们作好十二亩秧田；而第二生产队就帮助第一生产队整好在山地的七十多亩旱土和积肥一千二百多担。这样等价交换，互相协作，大家都把生产搞好了。
    其次，便于计划播种，分批育秧，以调剂劳力，使前后作物更好地衔接起来。
    第三，便于推行新的育秧技术。现在，每个秧田基地选种站，都做好了温汤选种用的三角连环灶，准备了食盐、福尔马林、赛力散等选种消毒用的药品，全部种子都进行了除稗工作，并已训练三百多名专业选种育秧人员，来掌握这些新的技术。
    最后，秧田集中成片，统一管理，可以大大节省劳力。去年分散育秧时，全社要用一千一百多人负责管理秧田，现在统一看水管理，只要三百一十二名老农就够了。
