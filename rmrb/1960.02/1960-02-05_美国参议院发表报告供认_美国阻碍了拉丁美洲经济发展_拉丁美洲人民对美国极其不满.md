Xinhua News Agency, Washington Dispatch: According to TASS, the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Subcommittee on Latin America issued a report on January 30 entitled "The Impact of Politics on Economic Relations Between the United States and Latin American Nations," specifically analyzing the current economic relations between the United States and Latin American countries. The report explicitly acknowledges in many places that the economic relationship between the United States and Latin American countries is a "one-way street," which has brought many benefits to the United States but has hindered the normal economic development and consolidation of Latin American countries.

The report was drafted by the National Planning Association at the request of the subcommittee.

The report states that although various meetings are frequently held between countries in this hemisphere, Latin American governments believe that the main purpose of these meetings is to have them support U.S. policies and measures to deal with various threats of the Cold War—military, political, economic, and psychological.

The report's drafters then bluntly pointed out that, in its economic policies toward Latin America, the United States is naturally bound to proceed from considerations of direct self-interest, so that its economic relations with Latin America can extract the maximum amount of profit while reducing the value paid to a minimum.

The report points out that the high import tariffs imposed by the United States on goods from Latin American countries, especially commodities such as lead, zinc, and petroleum, have created artificial obstacles to the development of these industrial sectors in Latin American countries.

The report continues to point out that, until now, the United States has only been concerned with strengthening its political and economic influence in South America in its relations with Latin American countries. When it comes to the question of what real assistance the United States can provide to strengthen the economies of Latin American countries, the United States likes to make empty promises and say meaningless nice words.

The report points out that it is precisely this policy of the United States that makes the people of Latin America hold extremely unfriendly attitudes towards their northern neighbor. The report's drafters directly admit that "words such as 'freedom,' 'security,' and 'progress,' which are often used to tout the aims of U.S. policy, provide no basis for believing that these abstract cherished things can be realized."

The report recommends establishing a North-South American common market under the protection of the United States, and also recommends gradually realizing the "economic integration" of the entire Western Hemisphere.

To emphasize the necessity of accepting these recommendations, the report's drafters attempted to scare the governments of Latin American countries with the "increasing communist threat" in Latin America.

It should be pointed out that the true role of the United States in Latin American countries, as acknowledged in the report, is very different from the peaceful picture of "good neighborliness" depicted by the U.S. propaganda machine due to Eisenhower's upcoming visit to some Latin American countries.

### 美国参议院发表报告供认  美国阻碍了拉丁美洲经济发展  拉丁美洲人民对美国极其不满

    美国参议院发表报告供认
    美国阻碍了拉丁美洲经济发展
    拉丁美洲人民对美国极其不满
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社华盛顿讯：美国参议院外交委员会拉丁美洲小组委员会1月30日发表了一个题为“政治对美国和拉丁美洲国家之间经济关系的影响”的报告，专门分析了目前美国和拉丁美洲国家之间的经济关系。报告中有许多地方明显地承认，美国和拉丁美洲国家之间的经济关系是“一条单行线”，这种关系给美国带来了不少好处，但是却阻碍着拉丁美洲国家正常的经济发展和它们经济的巩固。
    这个报告是应小组委员会的要求由全国计划协会起草的。
    报告说，尽管这个半球之间的各国仍然经常举行形形色色的会议，但是，拉丁美洲各国政府相信，这种会议的主要目的就是要它们支持美国的政策和措施，以便对付冷战的各种威胁——军事的、政治的、经济的和心理的威胁。
    报告起草人接着直言不讳地指出，在对拉丁美洲的经济政策中，美国很自然地势必从直接利己主义的考虑出发，使自己同拉丁美洲的经济关系能最大量地吸取利润，而把付出的价值减少到最低限度。
    报告指出，美国对拉丁美洲国家的商品，特别是铅、锌、石油这样一些商品规定的高额入口税，使拉丁美洲国家这些工业部门的发展受到人为的障碍。
    报告接着指出，直到现在为止，美国在同拉丁美洲国家的关系中关心的只是如何加强自己在南美大陆上的政治和经济影响。一当涉及为了加强拉丁美洲国家的经济，美国能够提供什么真正援助的问题时，美国就喜欢口头上许下一些空泛的诺言，说些毫无意义的漂亮话。
    报告指出，正是美国的这种政策使得拉丁美洲的人民对北邻抱极不友善的态度。报告起草人直接承认，“像‘自由’、‘安全’、‘进步’这样一些通常用来标榜美国政策的宗旨的名词，丝毫不能提供根据，使人相信这些抽象的被珍视的东西能够兑现。”
    报告建议建立一个在美国庇护下的南北美共同市场，还建议逐步实现整个西半球“经济整体化”。
    为了强调接受这些建议的必要性，报告起草人企图用在拉丁美洲“日益加强的共产主义威胁”来吓唬拉丁美洲国家政府。
    应当指出，报告承认的美国对拉丁美洲国家的真正作用，跟美国宣传机构由于艾森豪威尔即将访问一些拉丁美洲国家而描绘出来的“睦邻关系”的太平景象大有不同。
