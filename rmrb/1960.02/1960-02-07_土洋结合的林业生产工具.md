    Combining Indigenous and Foreign Forestry Production Tools

    Animal-Powered Planting Machine
    The animal-powered planting machine, created in Tao'an County, Jilin Province, is a modification of a double-wheeled double-share plow.
    The specific modification method is: remove the shares from the double-wheeled double-share plow and install a seedling trenching device; install a seedling box and a seat for planting personnel on the top of the original plow body's rear, and nail foot pedals on both sides of the wooden frame, with a soil-compacting wheel installed below the seat. When in use, it is pulled by four draft animals, and two people sit in the chairs to plant seedlings. This machine can afforest about two hectares per day, improving efficiency by more than twenty times compared to manual planting using shovels or hoes.

    "Soaring Sky" Brand Afforestation Hole Digger
    The "Soaring Sky" brand afforestation hole digger is a new product trial-produced by the Harbin Forestry Machinery Factory. It can loosen the soil and can be used for digging holes before manual afforestation and manual regeneration planting. The diameter of the dug holes can be adjusted to 30 or 50 centimeters as needed, and the depth can reach 35 centimeters. The soil in the hole does not scatter after tilling, meeting the requirements of afforestation technical regulations. When in use, it is operated by two people lifting it. Because this hole digger is very light, it is very convenient to carry and transport, and it is easy to carry it up the mountain for digging holes for afforestation. Using this hole digger, it takes an average of five to six seconds to dig a hole in weed-free areas. In areas with more weeds and thick ground cover, auxiliary workers are needed to cooperate in weeding, and depending on the degree of grass root entanglement, it takes an average of sixteen seconds per hole, increasing work efficiency by about ten times compared to manual digging.

    Chinese Fir Seeder
    The Chinese fir seeder was created by the Zhongtang Nursery in Xiuning County, Anhui Province. The structure of this tool consists of a frame, seed box, rotating gears, and compaction roller.
    The frame consists of a base and a handle. A round wooden compaction roller is installed in front of the frame, with two small gears at both ends of the axle. The compaction roller moves on the bed surface, serving both as a source of power and to compact the seedbed. The seed box is divided into five grids, shaped like funnels, wide at the top and narrow at the bottom. Each grid has a rubber tongue on the inside, tightly attached to a seeding shaft with divided concave eyes at the bottom of the box. The rubber tongue can control the switch and the amount of seeding. As long as the seeding shaft is made according to specifications and can rotate evenly, seeds can be sown evenly.
    Using it, one person can sow one mu of land every ten minutes, increasing work efficiency by thirteen and a half times compared to manual sowing, and the sowing is very even.

    Automatic Direct Seeder
    The versatile automatic direct seeder was created by Li Guangyuan in Jilin Province. It is suitable for direct seeding afforestation of various small and medium-sized seeds. The inner cylinder holds the seeds and has only one spring opening. The middle cylinder has eight different sizes of seed output openings. Various openings can adjust the seeding amount and adapt to the particle size of various small and medium-sized seeds. Before seeding, first align the inner cylinder opening that is suitable for the seed size with the notch in the middle cylinder opening, and then put the seeds into the inner cylinder. When spot seeding, lift and release the handle on the inner cylinder, and the seeds will automatically be sown into the ground. The depth of entry into the soil can be adjusted with adjusting screws according to requirements.

    Funnel-type Soil Covering Machine
    The funnel-type soil covering machine was created by the Tongcun Nursery in Nanling County, Anhui Province. Using this machine to cover soil results in even and fine coverage. The main components of this tool include a soil-holding funnel, wooden harrow, cylindrical iron sieve, frame, and rollers. When covering soil, first close the switch, and after the soil is loaded into the soil-holding funnel, determine the size of the opening of the switch plate according to the thickness of the soil covering. During operation, it is pushed by two or four people.
    The efficiency of the soil covering machine: four people operating it can cover 27 to 30 mu of land per day, increasing work efficiency by about twelve times, not only reducing the manual soil sieving process but also covering the soil evenly.

    土洋结合的林业生产工具
    畜力植树机
    双轮双铧犁改装的植树机，是吉林洮安县创造的。
    具体改法是：把双轮双铧犁拆去铧犁，装上植苗开沟器；在原犁身尾部上面安装苗木箱和植苗人员的座位，木架两侧再钉上脚踏板，座位下面安装培土镇压轮。使用的时候，用四个耕畜牵引，两人坐在椅子上植苗。这种机器每天可造林两公顷左右，比人工使用铁锹或洋镐植树，提高效率约二十倍以上。
    冲天牌造林挖坑机
    冲天牌造林挖坑机是哈尔滨林业机械厂试制的新产品。它能翻松土壤。可以用在人工造林和人工更新植树前的挖坑作业上。挖坑的直径可根据需要调整为三十或五十厘米，深度可达三十五厘米，整地后坑内土壤不飞散，符合造林技术规程的要求。使用的时候，由两人手抬操作。由于这种挖坑机重量很轻，携带和搬运都很方便，并且容易携带上山挖坑造林。用这种挖坑机，在无杂草地区平均挖一个坑需五、六秒钟，在杂草较多、地被物很厚的地区需要辅助工配合除草，按草根盘结程度不同，平均每坑需十六秒钟，比人工挖坑提高工效十倍左右。
    杉木播种机
    杉木播种机是安徽休宁县钟塘苗圃创造的。这种工具的构造是由机架、盛种箱、转动齿轮、镇压磙等部分组成。
    机架由机座及把柄两部分组成，机架前方安装一个圆形木制镇压磙，轴两端有两个小齿轮。镇压磙行走在床面上，既是动力的源泉，又起镇压苗床的作用；盛种箱箱内分五格，格子成漏斗形，上口大，下口小，每格内侧有一胶皮小舌，紧贴着箱底的一根带有分格凹眼播种轴，胶皮小舌能控制开关及播种量大小，只要播种轴作得合乎规格，能均匀翻动，即可均匀播下种子。
    用它，一个人每十分钟能播一亩地，比人工手播提高工效十三倍半，而且播得很均匀。
    自动直播器
    万能式自动直播器是吉林省李广元创造的。它适用于各种不同中小粒种子的直播造林。内筒放置种子，只有一个弹簧口门；中间筒有八个不同大小的输出种子的口门。各种口门可以调节播种量与适应各种中小粒种子的粒径。播种前，先根据种子的大小，将适合种子大小的内筒口门对好中筒口门的缺口，然后将种子放入内筒。点播时将内筒上的提把向上一提一松，种子就自动播入地里。入土深浅可以根据要求，用调节螺丝调节。
    漏斗式复土机
    漏斗式复土机是由安徽南陵县童村苗圃创造的。用这种机器复土，均匀、细致。这种工具主要组成部分有盛种漏斗、木耖、滚筒形铁筛、框架、滚轮。复土时先将开关关好，土装进盛土漏斗后，根据复土的厚薄来决定开关板启开的大小。操作的时候由两人或四人推动。
    复土机的工效：四人操作，每天可复土二十七亩至三十亩，比人工提高工效十二倍左右，不但减少了人工筛土工序，而且复土均匀。
