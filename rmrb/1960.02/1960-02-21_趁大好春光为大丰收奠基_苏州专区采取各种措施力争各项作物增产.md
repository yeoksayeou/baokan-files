Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, February 20th: Striving for higher yields and greater leaps forward! Millions of commune members in the Suzhou Region of Jiangsu Province, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, are brimming with ambition and determined to work hard this spring to lay a solid foundation for achieving a bumper harvest of grain, cotton, oil, and pigs this year.

The Suzhou Region has limited land and a large population, with an average of less than two mu of land per person. To seize a full-year bumper harvest of grain, cotton, oil, and pigs, the commune members in various people's communes have adopted a series of measures that are both full of soaring enthusiasm and down-to-earth, striving to produce more grain, cotton, oil crops, and other crops on the existing land. Vigorously improving farming techniques, expanding planting areas, and increasing land utilization rates are the first measures they have taken. In this spirit, various localities first rationally plan crop layouts. They are doing everything possible to increase the multiple cropping index and appropriately expand the area of double-cropping rice. Wherever conditions permit intercropping and mixed planting, they are promoting intercropping and mixed planting. The region plans to plant 450,000 mu of double-cropping rice this year, an increase of 10% over last year. Changshu County plans to expand the double-cropping rice planting area from 15,000 mu last year to 70,000 mu. Together with other intercropping and mixed planting, the multiple cropping index this year will increase from the original 200% to 300%. At present, various localities are fully mobilizing cadres and the masses to discuss and implement the layout plan down to the team and the field. At the same time, in conjunction with water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, various localities have leveled 700,000 mu of land and reclaimed 45,000 mu of wasteland.

Increasing fertilizer application is another important link for various localities to strive for high yields. Since last winter, the entire region has launched a vigorous fertilizer accumulation campaign centered on pig raising and focusing on large-scale grass and pond mud collection. As of now, 340,000 laborers have been invested in fertilizer accumulation throughout the region, and the fertilizer accumulation task has been overfulfilled. The average amount of fertilizer per mu is 181 dan, of which more than 50% is fine fertilizer such as grass and pond mud, more than double the same period last year. Due to the victorious development of the fertilizer accumulation campaign, the original requirement of accumulating 250 dan of base fertilizer per mu by mid-March has now been increased to 300 dan.

According to the plan, the region will also accelerate the pace of agricultural technological transformation to further improve labor productivity. In terms of water conservancy, efforts will be made to achieve the electrification of irrigation and drainage throughout the region. Of the 305 new electromechanical irrigation areas planned for this year, 54 irrigation areas have been fully completed, and more than 80% of the remaining 200 or so projects have also been completed. The region will realize partial mechanization and semi-mechanization of cultivation this year, and electric plows will be promoted in a planned way. At present, various localities are focusing on the trial use of electric plows. After successful trial use, Xin Zhuang Commune in Changshu has decided to use electric plows for deep plowing on 40% of the commune's cultivated land this year.

Due to the strengthening of draft cattle maintenance work and the vigorous promotion of draft cattle fattening, the condition of draft cattle has generally improved, better than in previous years. Seventy percent of the draft cattle in the region are in 80% or more good condition, preparing livestock power for spring plowing needs. This year, the seeds in various localities have undergone piece-by-piece and ear-by-ear selection, basically achieving superior purification. According to recent inspections, the seeds stored in various localities can meet the needs. Areas that have partially adjusted the layout of medium- and late-season rice have also exchanged and prepared sufficient seeds.

In the continuous great leaps forward of the past two years, the people's communes throughout the region have created many experiences in large-scale high-yield production. In order to promote these high-yield experiences, fully implement the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, and improve farming techniques this year, each county has established a technical reform office to strengthen technical guidance, disseminate advanced experiences, and ensure the thorough implementation of various high-yield measures. Since the Spring Festival, various on-site meetings of technical cadres and production experts have been held from top to bottom to exchange last year's experiences and train a large number of technical backbones, providing sufficient technical force for the implementation of various high-yield measures.

The region's pig production this year will also strive for a greater leap forward. The region's pig raising plan is to increase from the current 1.3 million heads to 5 million heads. After this plan is realized, there will be an average of 1.5 pigs per person in the rural population of the region. At present, the entire region is building collective pig farms and piglet breeding farms on a large scale, while carrying out a mass movement to prevent and control pig diseases.

In order to further promote current production, the Suzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a spring sowing mobilization meeting on the 18th, attended by Party secretaries of various counties, communes, and production brigades, to specifically deploy spring sowing work, further mobilize the people of the entire region to set off a greater production upsurge, and strive to ensure the realization of the region's leap forward plan this year.

### 趁大好春光为大丰收奠基  苏州专区采取各种措施力争各项作物增产

    趁大好春光为大丰收奠基
    苏州专区采取各种措施力争各项作物增产
    新华社南京20日电　高产再高产，跃进更跃进。江苏省苏州专区各地人民公社数百万社员在各级党委领导下，壮志凌云，决心大干一春，为实现今年粮棉油猪大丰收打下良好基础。
    苏州专区田少人多，平均每人有土地不到二亩，为了夺取全年粮棉油猪大丰收，各人民公社社员采取了一系列既是干劲冲天，又是踏踏实实的措施，力争在现有的土地上，生产出更多的粮、棉、油料和其他作物来。千方百计改进耕作技术，扩大播种面积，提高土地利用率，是他们采取的第一个措施。本着这个精神，各地首先合理规划作物布局。千方百计地提高复种指数，适当扩大双季稻面积，凡是有条件套种和夹种的地方都推行套种和夹种。全区今年计划种植双季稻四十五万亩，比去年扩大10％。常熟县双季稻播种面积计划从去年的一万五千亩扩大到七万亩，连同其他套种夹种，今年的复种指数将从原来的200％提高到300％。目前各地正充分发动干部群众讨论，把布局规划落实到队、到田。与此同时，各地并结合兴修水利积肥等工作，平整土地七十万亩，开垦荒地四万五千亩。
    增加施肥量，是各地争取丰产的另一重要环节。去冬以来全区就以养猪为中心、以大搞草塘泥为重点，展开了热火朝天的积肥运动。截至目前，全区投入积肥的劳力有三十四万人，已超额完成积肥任务，平均每亩有肥料一百八十一担，其中有草塘泥等精肥50％以上，比去年同期增长一倍多。由于积肥运动胜利发展，全区原来要求到3月中旬每亩地积基肥二百五十担，现在已加码为三百担。
    根据规划，全区还将加速农业技术改造的步伐，以进一步提高劳动生产率。在水利方面，争取实现全区排灌机电化，今年计划新建的三百零五个机电灌区的渠道工程，现在已有五十四个灌区全部建成，其余的二百多个工程也已完成80％以上。全区今年将实现耕作部分机械化和半机械化，有步骤地推广电犁。目前，各地正在有重点地试用电犁，常熟辛庄公社在试用成功后，决定今年全社40％的耕地都采用电犁深翻。
    由于加强了耕牛保养工作，大搞耕牛复膘运动，因而耕牛膘势普遍增长，膘势好过往年。全区耕牛八成膘以上的70％，为春耕需用的畜力作好了准备。今年，各地的种子都经过片选穗选，基本上达到优纯化。据最近检查，各地储备的种子已能满足需要，部分调整中晚稻布局的地区，也都经过串换备足了种子。
    去、前两年连续大跃进中，全区各人民公社创造了许多大面积丰产的经验，为了推广这些高产经验，全面贯彻八字宪法，使今年耕作技术作得更好。各县都成立了技术改革办公室，加强技术指导，传播先进经验，保证各项丰产措施彻底贯彻执行。各地自春节后，通过自上而下已召开各种专业的技术干部和生产能手现场会议多次，交流了去年的经验，培训了大量的技术骨干，为实现各项丰产措施，提供了足够的技术力量。
    专区今年的养猪生产也要争取有更大的跃进，全区养猪计划要从现在的一百三十多万头发展到五百万头，这个计划实现后，按全区农村人口平均，每人有一头半猪。现在，全区正在大建集体养猪场和仔猪繁育场，同时开展防治生猪疫病的群众运动。
    为了进一步推动当前生产，中共苏州地委18日召开了有各县、公社和生产大队党委书记参加的春播动员大会，具体部署春播工作，进一步发动全区人民掀起更大的生产高潮，为保证实现全区今年的跃进规划而斗争。
