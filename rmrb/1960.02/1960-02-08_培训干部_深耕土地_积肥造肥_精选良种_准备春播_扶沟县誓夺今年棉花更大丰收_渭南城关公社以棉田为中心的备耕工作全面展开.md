    This newspaper reports: Based on the great leap forward in cotton production in 1959, the people of Fugou County, Henan Province, started early and vigorously engaged in winter deep plowing of cotton fields and spring planting preparations, vowing to seize an even greater cotton harvest this year. Currently, all of the county's more than 150,000 mu of cotton fields have been winter plowed, generally plowing to a depth of about one foot, applying about 20,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu, and all have achieved high-standard garden-like fields, with a thorough watering. The county has also established more than 800 seedling greenhouses.

    Before 1958, cotton production in Fugou County was very low, with an average yield of only twenty or so jin of ginned cotton per mu. Since 1958, vigorous efforts have been made to establish high-yield cotton demonstration plots, driving a comprehensive leap forward in cotton production. In 1959, the county's more than 130,000 mu of cotton fields averaged 115 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 1.6 times compared to 1958, of which 45,000 mu of high-yield demonstration plots averaged 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu. In order to achieve even higher cotton yields this year, the county, immediately after the cotton harvest last year, mobilized the masses from the county party committee and commune party committees to production brigades, summarizing the experience of increasing cotton production over the years and analyzing the favorable situation for even higher cotton yields in 1960: (1) Over the past two years, cotton scientific research guidance stations and scientific research offices have been established in every commune and brigade, accumulating a large amount of archival data; and more than 11,000 technical personnel have been trained in combination with production. (2) After leveling the land and vigorously carrying out field projects, such as digging canals and repairing gates, all cotton fields can be freely drained and irrigated after the winter of 1959. The 150,000 mu of cotton fields can all be irrigated once in four to six days. (3) With the development of the pig-raising industry, 1.3 billion jin of high-quality fertilizer, 1.7 billion jin of coarse fertilizer, and 4.9 million jin of soil-converted fertilizer have been accumulated, providing more than 20,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu of cotton field, which is not only better in quality than the fertilizer in 1959, but also increased in quantity by 40%. (4) When harvesting cotton last year, methods of selecting cotton at harvest, single ginning, and single storage were adopted. The county selected 5.02 million jin of excellent varieties, with a purity generally reaching about 98%. After summarizing and analyzing the favorable situation, the commune members have generally established confidence in striving for higher cotton yields and realized the truth that "doing everything early means one early makes a hundred earlies", and quickly launched a production upsurge centered on winter deep plowing and spring planting preparations throughout the county.

    The county plans to plant more than 150,000 mu of cotton this year, an expansion of 16% compared to last year, of which more than 60,000 mu are high-yield demonstration plots.

    In November last year, the county party committee established a cotton field winter plowing and spring planting command, and each commune and brigade established offices. The county party committee dispatched three secretaries and five members, and the communes and brigades dispatched party secretaries, members, and brigade branch secretaries, more than 330 people, fixed professional labor of 28,400 people, 5,800 technicians and local experts, to divide up the areas and take responsibility.

    Last year, many communes in Fugou County adopted greenhouse seedling raising, which advanced the cotton seedling growing period by fifty to sixty days, so the ability to resist natural disasters was strong, with more bolls, early maturity, and high yield. The Zhaizhuang Production Team of Chengguan Commune raised seedlings in eleven mu of greenhouses last year, with a yield of more than 550 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of about 60% compared to row planting. This year, the county has paid great attention to promoting this experience. While deep plowing in winter, it has organized labor to build 854 new greenhouses, of which 793 have been raising seedlings in a timely manner. In addition, 1,800 square meters of greenhouses have been established, with more than 8.4 million square grid seedlings, and more than 500 greenhouses have cotton seedlings that have already shown true leaves and are developing vigorously.

    In order to ensure quality, the county, headed by the secretary of the county party committee secretariat, formed a technical guidance group of 54 people, including technicians and local experts, to go to the communes and production teams to inspect the winter plowing and seedling raising situation and organize technical instruction.

    Now, more than 20,000 laborers are concentrating their efforts on accumulating and making fertilizer, manufacturing soil pesticides, and conducting seed germination tests, to make all preparations for spring planting.

    This newspaper reports: Spring plowing and planting preparations centered on cotton field preparations have been fully launched in Chengguan Commune, Weinan County, Shaanxi.

    Recently, although the climate here is still around zero degrees Celsius, the commune members, immediately after completing an intense winter wheat irrigation task, immediately switched to cotton field preparation work. At dawn, the commune members drove carts to deliver fertilizer to the cotton fields, and others diverted water for irrigation. According to statistics, more than 27,000 mu of cotton fields in the commune have been applied with base fertilizer, accounting for 60.4% of the cotton field planting area; more than 11,000 mu of cotton fields have been irrigated, accounting for more than 90% of the area to be irrigated. The commune members also generally cleared weeds from the five edges (field edges, well edges, canal edges, grave edges, and road edges), sprayed medicinal powder on pepper trees, pomegranate trees, locust trees, and jasmine trees, and disinfected cotton warehouses to completely eliminate overwintering pests. The commune has newly dug 1,500 fertilizer accumulation pits and built three new pig pens in wheat fields and cotton fields. The sheep pens were also moved to the mountains. All these have prepared conditions for gradually establishing a fertilizer network in the fields. The Shuangwang, Zhuwang, Youyi, and Youxi production teams, where the preparation work is progressing faster, have all fertilized their cotton fields, applying an average of 10,000 to 15,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. Now they are starting to level the land and harrow to preserve moisture.

    The cotton high-yield competition movement of "learning from Qiu Xiang and catching up with Qiu Xiang" has been launched vigorously. Before the preparation, the commune invited Zhang Qiuxiang to impart cotton planting experience at the production team leader meeting and the commune member representative meeting. Combining the study of these experiences, each team and group generally formulated this year's cotton high-yield plan. Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton planting team has processed, added water, and added fertilizer eleven times to this year's cotton fields from deep plowing to the present. Cao Zhuxiang's cotton planting team of the Hongxing Production Team will continue to launch a friendly competition with Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton planting team this year. The team's 27 mu of high-yield fields have been fertilized twice and irrigated once, and they are now stepping up seed selection. In order to make the high-yield competition movement more extensive and in-depth, the commune decided to organize 1,000 Qiuxiang groups (cotton planting professional groups) to plant 10,000 mu of Qiuxiang fields (high-yield demonstration plots), and take the 17.7 mu of high-yield fields that Zhang Qiuxiang participated in as command fields, driving five high-yield networks, combining the nets with the squares. These high-yield demonstration plots will implement unified plans and unified measures, and cultivate cotton completely in accordance with Zhang Qiuxiang's operating procedures.

    As an important part of spring plowing and spring planting preparations, the work of repairing agricultural tools in this commune started very early. According to incomplete statistics, from last winter to the present, the commune has added more than 21,900 new spring plowing and spring planting agricultural tools and repaired more than 18,000 old agricultural tools. In the agricultural tool repair work, many production teams transferred special personnel to inspect the agricultural tools of collectives and commune members group by group and household by household.

    Now, the commune has established a production guidance committee centered on cotton preparation, headed by the secretary of the commune party committee, with an office under it to specifically lead the preparation work. Before the Spring Festival, all cotton fields in the commune will be fertilized for the first time; within ten days after the Spring Festival, it is required to basically select seeds, and ensure that all selected seeds have no worm seeds, light seeds, broken seeds, and moldy seeds. The commune also plans to organize an inspection team to go to each team to conduct a comprehensive and systematic inspection of this year's preparation situation recently.

    培训干部　深耕土地　积肥造肥　精选良种　准备春播
    扶沟县誓夺今年棉花更大丰收
    渭南城关公社以棉田为中心的备耕工作全面展开
    本报讯　河南省扶沟县人民在1959年棉花生产大跃进的基础上，及早动手，大搞棉田冬深耕和春播准备工作，誓夺今年棉花更大丰收。目前，全县十五万多亩棉田，已全部冬耕完毕，一般深翻一尺左右，每亩施底肥两万斤左右，全部实现了高标准园田化，普浇一遍塌地水。全县还建立育苗温室八百多间。
    扶沟县1958年以前，棉花产量很低，平均亩产皮棉只有二十多斤。1958年以来，大搞棉花丰产方，带动了棉花生产全面跃进。1959年，全县十三万多亩棉花，平均亩产皮棉一百一十五斤，比1958年增长一点六倍，其中四万五千亩丰产方平均亩产皮棉二百斤。这个县为了今年棉花再高产，在去年棉花收摘刚结束后，从县委、公社党委到生产大队，层层发动群众，总结历年来棉花增产经验和分析1960年棉花更高产的有利形势：（一）两年来，社社队队建立棉花科学研究指导站、科学研究室，积累了大量的档案资料；结合生产培养和训练了一万一千多名技术人员。（二）经过1959年冬平整土地，大搞田间工程，挖渠修闸等工程，使全部棉田排灌自如，十五万多亩棉田在四至六天内可以全部轮浇一遍。（三）随着养猪事业的发展，已积优质肥十三亿斤，粗肥十七亿斤，造土化肥四百九十万斤，为每亩棉田备足底肥二万多斤，不仅比1959年的肥料质量好，而且数量增加40％。（四）去年收摘棉花时，采用絮选、单轧、单保管的办法，全县选出优良品种五百零二万斤，纯度一般都达到98％左右。经过总结和分析有利形势，社员们普遍树立了争取棉花高产再高产的信心，并认识到“事事赶早，一早百早”的道理，迅速在全县范围内展开了以冬耕深翻和春播准备为中心的生产高潮。
    全县今年计划种植棉花十五万多亩，比去年扩大16％，其中丰产方六万余亩。
    去年11月，县委就建立了棉田冬耕春播指挥部，各公社、大队建立了办公室。县委抽出三名书记、五名委员，公社、大队抽出党委书记、委员和大队支书三百三十余名，固定专业劳力二万八千四百人，五千八百名技术员和土专家，分片包干。
    去年扶沟县许多公社采取温室育苗，使棉苗生长期提前五十至六十天，因此抵抗自然灾害能力强，结桃多，成熟早，产量高。城关公社翟庄生产队去年温室育苗十一亩，亩产皮棉五百五十多斤，比耧播增产六成左右。今年全县都非常注意推广这一经验，在冬耕深翻的同时，组织劳力新建温室八百五十四间，已适时育苗的有七百九十三间。此外，还建立温室一千八百平方米，方格育苗八百四十多万个，并有五百多间温室育的棉苗已经现出真叶，发育健壮。
    为了保证质量，县以县委书记处书记为首，由技术员、土专家等五十四人组成了技术辅导团，分路到各公社、生产队一面检查冬耕和育苗情况，一面组织技术传授。
    现在全县二万多名劳动大军，正集中力量大搞积肥造肥，制造土农药，进行种子发芽试验，为春播作好一切准备。
    本报讯　以棉田备耕为中心的春耕播种准备工作，已经在陕西渭南县城关公社全面展开。
    最近，这里的气候虽然还在摄氏零度左右，但是社员们在一场紧张的小麦冬灌任务刚刚结束之后，立即转入了棉田备耕工作。天稍亮，社员们有的赶着大车给棉田送肥，有的引水灌溉。据统计，全社已有二万七千多亩棉田施了底肥，占棉田播种面积60．4％；有一万一千多亩棉田得到了灌溉，占应灌面积90％以上。社员们还普遍铲除了五边（地边、井边、渠边、坟边、路边）的杂草，给花椒树、石榴树、洋槐树、木金花树喷洒了药粉，对棉花仓库进行了消毒，彻底消灭越冬虫害。全社在麦田和棉田地头新挖积肥坑一千五百个，新建猪圈三个，把两群羊的圈也搬到了山上，这些都为逐步在田间建立肥料网准备了条件。备耕工作进展较快的双王、朱王、友谊、游西等生产队，棉田全部施了肥，平均每亩施肥一万到一万五千斤。现在他们开始平整土地和耙耱保墒。
    “学秋香、赶秋香”的棉花丰产竞赛运动，已经轰轰烈烈地开展起来。在备耕以前，这个公社请张秋香在生产队长会议和社员代表大会上传授了植棉经验。结合学习这些经验，各队、组普遍制订了今年的棉花丰产计划。张秋香领导的植棉小组，今年的棉田从深翻到现在，已经加工、加水、加肥十一次。红星生产队曹竹香植棉组，今年要继续和张秋香植棉组展开友谊竞赛，全组二十七亩丰产田，已经施了两次肥，灌了一次水，现在正在加紧选种。为了使丰产竞赛运动更加广泛和深入地开展，这个公社决定组织一千个秋香组（植棉专业组），种植万亩秋香田（丰产方），并以张秋香参加作务的十七亩七分丰产田为指挥田，带动五个丰产网，以网带方，方网结合。这些丰产方要实行统一计划和统一措施，完全按照张秋香的操作规程培育棉花。
    作为春耕春播准备一项重要内容的农具检修工作，在这个公社很早就开始了。据不完全统计，从去冬到现在，全社已新添春耕春播农具二万一千九百多件，修补旧农具一万八千多件。在农具检修工作中，许多生产队抽调专人，对集体和社员个人的农具逐组逐户作了检查。
    现在，这个公社已经成立了以棉花备耕为中心的生产指导委员会，由公社党委书记挂帅，下设办公室，具体领导备耕工作。在春节前，全社棉田全部施完第一次肥；在春节后十天内，要求基本选好种子，保证选出的种子全部没有虫籽、光籽、破籽和霉籽。全社还计划最近组织一个检查团，分赴各队对今年备耕情况进行一次全面的系统的检查。
