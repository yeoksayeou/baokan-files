Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 18th: The Wuhan Iron and Steel Company launched a "one-dragon" joint technical performance competition led by the iron smelting plant, setting a new record for the company's highest average daily output since the two blast furnaces have been producing side-by-side.

The performance competition, which ran from February 8th to 13th, increased the average daily pig iron production of Wuhan Steel by 25% compared to the average daily production in January of this year, and by 12% compared to the average daily production from February 1st to 7th. The coke ratio also decreased by 13.5% compared to January, and by 6% compared to February 1st to 7th. The output of ore, coke, and sintered ore related to iron smelting production has increased significantly, and the quality has also improved. The supply of limestone and dolomite has also basically met the needs of blast furnace production.

Wuhan Steel's iron smelting production involves a wide range, with a high degree of mechanization and automation of equipment, complex operations, and close links between shifts, requiring the enterprise to organize high collaboration and close cooperation in all links when leading iron smelting production. In response to this characteristic, Wuhan Steel has been carrying out a "one-dragon" competition since last year, organizing mines, coking plants, power plants, and other units to cooperate with the iron smelting plant. Within the iron smelting plant, various workshops were also organized to cooperate with the blast furnace. This performance competition, based on the "one-dragon" competition, absorbed the experience of the Dazhi Steel Plant's tackling key problems campaign and the Anshan Iron and Steel's technical performance competition, and used advanced figures such as "learning from Ma Xuei externally and learning from Li Feng'en internally" as ideological motivation to carry it out in a planned and led manner.

Through this "one-dragon" joint technical performance competition, not only did Wuhan Steel's various units cooperate closely with the iron smelting plant and greatly promote the spirit of collaboration, but also the masses' enthusiasm for technical innovation was incorporated into the main attack direction, the potential of equipment was brought into play, and the foundation was laid for further launching mass movements in the iron smelting system. At present, the broad masses of workers are summarizing their experiences, consolidating existing achievements, preparing for the next battle, and determined to bring the daily output of pig iron to a higher level.

    一条龙表演赛显示群众运动威力
    武钢生铁产量创新纪录
    新华社武汉18日电　武汉钢铁公司开展以炼铁厂为首的一条龙联合技术表演赛，创造了这个公司两座高炉并肩生产以来最高平均日产量纪录。
    从2月8日开始到13日结束的这次表演赛，使武钢生铁的平均日产量比今年1月份平均日产量增长25％，比2月1日到7日的平均日产量增长12％；焦比也比1月下降13．5％，比2月1日到7日下降6％。跟炼铁生产有关的矿石、焦炭、烧结矿的产量都有巨大增长，并且提高了质量。其它如石灰石、白云石的供应量也都基本上满足了高炉生产的需要。
    武钢炼铁生产涉及的范围广，设备的机械化、自动化程度高，操作复杂，班和班之间联系紧密，要求企业在领导炼铁生产中组织高度协作，各个环节紧密配合。针对这一特点，武钢从去年起就开展了一条龙竞赛，组织矿山、焦化厂、动力厂等单位同炼铁厂协作，在炼铁厂内部也组织了各车间同高炉协作。这次表演赛，就是在一条龙竞赛基础上，吸收大冶钢厂攻关运动的经验和鞍钢技术表演赛经验，并且以“外学马学礼、内学李凤恩”等先进人物作为思想动力，有计划有领导地开展起来的。
  通过这次一条龙联合技术表演赛，不仅使武钢各单位同炼铁厂紧密配合，协作精神大大发扬，群众的技术革新积极性被纳入主攻方向，设备潜力得到发挥，而且为炼铁系统进一步开展群众运动打下了基础。目前，广大职工正在总结经验，巩固已有成果，为下一个战役作好准备，坚决要使生铁的日产量提到更高的水平。
