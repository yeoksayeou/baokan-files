    Intensified Internal Contradictions Within the North Atlantic Group
    Xi Linsheng

    The internal contradictions of the imperialist North Atlantic Group are deepening daily. These acute contradictions are particularly evident in the economic and diplomatic struggles between the major countries of the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany.

    Background to the Development of Contradictions

    The contradictions between the major imperialist countries have further developed against the following background.

    First, with the further prevalence of the East Wind over the West Wind, the socialist camp is growing stronger, the national independence movements are rising higher, and the difficulties of the entire imperialist camp are increasing. Since the end of the war, nearly thirty colonial countries have broken away from the shackles of imperialism and achieved independence. Many of these countries are further developing their own national economies. The territory of imperialism is shrinking day by day.

    Second, the economic crisis of 1957-1958 swept across the entire capitalist world. In 1958, industrial production in the capitalist world fell by 2.5%, and the value of foreign trade also fell by 5%. Since last year, capitalist countries have taken artificial measures to bring about a "slow recovery" in their economies (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe report). However, this recovery has only restored them to the level of 1957 and has not greatly restored the vitality of capitalist countries. In terms of steel production, the United States and Britain are still producing more than 20 million tons less than in 1957. For the United States, Britain, and West Germany, the situation in the coal mining industry is even "the worst year." Their output last year fell by nearly 70 million tons compared with 1958. West Germany's Ruhr area is piled up with nearly 18 million tons of unsold coal. For many capitalist countries, excess production capacity, inflation, unemployment, agricultural crises, and so on are still quite serious problems. Therefore, even as the Western press clamors for "prosperity," the United Nations economic report states, "There are still some black spots in the economic outlook of the capitalist world." And some American newspapers, such as "U.S. News & World Report," are even more worried that 1961 will be the most severe year of decline for American businesses since the war. In this year's economic report, U.S. President Eisenhower also admitted that a new economic crisis is still "a matter of concern to all Americans." Capitalist countries are trying their best to find a way out to solve their difficulties.

    Third, the imbalance in the economic development of capitalist countries is becoming increasingly apparent. The United States, which accounts for half of the capitalist world's economic power, has seen its economic position in the capitalist world relatively weakened. At the same time, the economic strength of Western European countries, particularly West Germany, which used to rely on the United States, has further increased. Looking at industrial production, if the 1953 level of industrial production is taken as 100, by 1958 West Germany had risen to 151%, France to 150%, and Britain to 114%. The United States, however, remained at 100%; and by 1959, the United States was at 111%, West Germany (eleven months) at 161%, France (nine months) at 153%, and Britain (eleven months) at 120%. In 1958, the share of U.S. industrial production in the capitalist world had already fallen from 56.4% in 1948 to 46.9%. The U.S. share of total capitalist world industrial product exports has also fallen from about 27% in 1950 to about 22% in 1959, Britain from 25.6% to 16.8%, while West Germany has increased from 7.7% to 19.3%. U.S. exports continue to decline, imports continue to increase, and in the past two years, there has been a huge deficit of nearly 7.4 billion U.S. dollars in foreign payments, leading to a large outflow of gold. From the beginning of 1958 to the end of 1959, the outflow of U.S. gold reached 3.44 billion U.S. dollars. The gold and foreign exchange reserves of Western European countries, however, increased by 3.85 billion U.S. dollars. It is estimated that the total gold and foreign exchange reserves of Western European countries in 1959 will reach more than 20 billion U.S. dollars. This not only eliminated the "dollar shortage" situation in Western European countries after the war but also greatly shook the position of the American "gold dollar empire." When summarizing the world economic situation in 1959, the U.S. Information Agency had to lament: "The entire era" of American dominance in the world market since the war "has ended."

    Since the fundamental change in the balance of power in the world in 1957, with the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, a serious "crisis of confidence" began to occur in the Western bloc with regard to the United States. As the relative economic strength of the United States weakens, this crisis deepens further. Some economic experts in Washington sadly sigh: "In the long run, the United States will certainly have to face this fundamental problem: it no longer has the means to implement its current 'leading' policy in the world." A report on U.S. European policy by a semi-official organization published by Senator Fulbright, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also admits that a "new idea of self-reliance without the United States" is currently being created in Western Europe. Changes in the political and economic strength within the Western bloc have intensified the struggle between the U.S.'s Western European "allies" and it for economic and political dominance.

    Ruthless Competition

    The economic struggle among the imperialist countries is prominently manifested in the struggle for spheres of investment influence. After the war, the United States, taking advantage of the serious damage to the vitality of Western European countries, steadily infiltrated the sphere of influence of its "allies." In 1950, the total amount of British investment in the Commonwealth was still 20% greater than that of the United States, but by 1958 it was completely equal. In Canada, U.S. investment is more than four times greater than British investment. In the most intense struggle for Middle East oil, the United States has overwhelmed Britain. In 1958, the United States controlled 45.7% of Middle East oil, while Britain controlled only about 20%. The United States is also trying to dig up colonies from France's hands. Since France was driven out of Indochina by the United States, the United States has been actively entering France's position in North Africa. The United States has taken advantage of the anti-colonial struggles in Morocco and Tunisia to actively infiltrate through loans. In 1959, U.S. loans to Morocco and Tunisia amounted to 60 million U.S. dollars. In addition, the United States has supplied several batches of military equipment to Tunisia, regardless of France's opposition. Now, American oil trusts have entered the Sahara, the largest oil resource area in French North Africa, obtained oil exploration rights, and monopolized the only oil pipeline leading to the port of Tunis.

    In the increasingly acute economic competition among imperialists, West Germany has become a powerful contender. In 1959, West German foreign investment increased from 27 million marks in 1952 to nearly 2.3 billion marks. West Germany is carrying out vigorous expansion in Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia. In the Middle East, West Germany, taking advantage of Britain's failure in the Suez Crisis, is desperately filling Britain's "vacuum" along with the United States.

    Britain and France naturally refuse to easily give up their spheres of influence and are trying to resist. Britain is trying to strengthen its control over the Commonwealth, and it is using the U.S. overseas payment deficit and the weakening of the dollar's position to accelerate the export of capital to the sterling area. France also exercises particularly strict control over the inflow of U.S. capital into North Africa. The "Petroleum Regulations" promulgated by the de Gaulle government at the end of 1958 stipulated that 50% of the profits of foreign oil companies in the Sahara belong to France. In 1959, France deliberately refused to approve the oil exploration contract of the U.S. New Jersey Standard Oil Company. These measures by France have aroused dissatisfaction among U.S. monopoly capital.

    The struggle for world markets is another focus of contradictions between imperialist countries. As the economic strength of Western European countries continues to increase, the competitive pressure felt by the United States in the world market is increasing. In the first half of 1959, U.S. exports decreased by 21.6% compared with the same period in 1957, while Western European countries increased by 2.7%. In the whole year of 1958 and the first half of 1959, U.S. exports to the Western European market decreased by 22% and 10% respectively compared with the previous year, and exports to Latin America also decreased by 11% and 15% respectively compared with the previous year. In the first half of 1959, the U.S. trade with Latin America even showed a deficit. However, the exports of some Western European countries, especially West Germany, have increased. In the Middle East, the share of the United States in the total exports of twelve major countries to the Middle East has decreased from 26% in 1948 to 21.6% in 1958. At the same time, Britain's share has decreased from 40.4% to 24%, while West Germany's share has increased sharply from 0.2% to 17.7%. Moreover, goods from Western European countries are now increasingly fiercely entering the domestic market that the United States has always protected very strictly. In the first eight months of last year, U.S. imports from West Germany increased by 44% compared with the same period in the previous year, France by 60%, and Britain by 37%. Small cars exported by Western European countries have seized more than 8% of the U.S. automobile market. Some countries that have consistently had a trade deficit with the United States, such as Britain and West Germany, also turned into a trade surplus last year. "U.S. News & World Report" admits that due to the "offensive of Western European rivals," "the era when American companies had an advantage and were easy to expand the market has been replaced by an era of ruthless competition."

    While competing with the United States for markets, competition among Western European countries is also becoming increasingly fierce. Two exclusive economic groups, the "Common Market" led by West Germany and the "Little Free Trade Area" led by Britain, have been formed, leading to the first public split among Western European capitalist countries since the war. The contrast in strength between these two economic groups and the United States can be seen from the following table:

Country Population (millions) % of industrial output in the capitalist world (1958) % of exports in the capitalist world (1958)
Six countries of the "Common Market" 166 21.6 24.1
West Germany 52.2 10.05 9.4
Seven countries of the "Little Free Trade Area" 88.3 11.3 16.8
Britain 51.7 8.3 9.6
United States 171.2 46.9 19

    The Western European market is an important market for Britain, second only to the Commonwealth. The six countries of the "Common Market" accommodate 14% of British exports. Therefore, the establishment of the "Common Market" is a serious blow to Britain. Now, Britain is organizing the "Little Free Trade Area" on the one hand to make up for the losses caused by the establishment of the "Common Market," and on the other hand as a retaliatory measure against the six countries of the "Common Market." Because for West Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy, the "Little Free Trade Area" is also a traditional market for them. 29% of West Germany's total exports are shipped to the "Common Market," and 27% are shipped to the "Little Free Trade Area." Exports to the "Little Free Trade Area" account for 24% of the Netherlands' exports and 17% of Italy's exports. This cannot but further sharpen the trade war among Western European countries. Although Britain and some countries are trying to build a "bridge" between the two groups, they have never been able to resolve the issue due to numerous contradictions. Recently, at the consultative assembly of fifteen European countries, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd even threatened that if the Common Market strictly adopts protectionist policies, "then a trade war will break out in Western Europe," and "political unity will not exist." "This will seriously affect the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."

    The confrontation between the two Western European economic groups is extremely unfavorable to the United States. U.S. exports to Western Europe account for more than a quarter of total U.S. exports. According to Western newspapers, due to the unfavorable U.S. foreign trade situation, on the one hand, the United States does not want the "six countries" and the "seven countries" to be sharply opposed, because the trade barriers set up by these two groups will exclude American goods. But on the other hand, the United States does not want these two groups to "unite" and "close the door" on the United States. In order to deal with this situation, the United States "is preparing to aim its firepower at some of its best allies" (Associated Press). The United States has urged its "allies" to repay their debts. At the meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade held last year, U.S. Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Dillon repeatedly threatened Western European countries to lift restrictions on imports of American goods with the threat that the United States would restore "protectionism and restrictive actions." Afterwards, Dillon personally went to Western Europe to "eliminate the obstacles to the import of American goods into Western Europe that the two opposing economic groups may cause," and expressed that the United States decided to "intervene" directly in the conflict between the two economic groups. Dillon also put pressure on its "allies" to come up with more "surplus" dollars to share the so-called "aid" to underdeveloped countries. By doing so, on the one hand, it can, under the control of the United States, unite the forces of Western countries and jointly carry out economic expansion into underdeveloped countries, and at the same time, it can reduce the capital with which "allies" compete with the United States. At the economic conference of thirteen Western countries held in Paris from January 12 to 14, the United States tried its best to force the two Western European economic groups to unilaterally relax import restrictions on American goods and asked them to bear more of the "aid" to underdeveloped countries. However, this noisy meeting reached some agreements only on procedural issues, such as the establishment of a committee with U.S. participation to reorganize the "European Economic Cooperation Agency" and the establishment of a group to study providing "aid" to "underdeveloped countries." As for some substantive issues, especially the conflict between the two Western European economic groups, the conference only decided to study them at a meeting "in the future." According to reports, the United States is now preparing to launch a "large-scale export promotion campaign for the first time in forty years" (Associated Press) to deal with the "increasingly fierce competition" from European "allies." It is precisely because their contradictions are irreconcilable that the economic struggle of several major capitalist countries will inevitably continue to develop.

    Challenge to U.S. Leadership

    These acute economic contradictions among imperialist countries cannot but be reflected in politics. Some U.S. newspapers admit that the reduced reliance of Western European countries on the United States has complicated relations between countries in the Western bloc. "Many countries and governments have become tired of not being taken seriously and being treated like junior partners" (U.S. "New York Times"). Recently, the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, in a report on U.S. policy toward Europe, while acknowledging the unity of socialist countries, could not help but lament the "deep distrust, even indifference," within the North Atlantic Group. The report also said: "The disunity within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, to say that it is only manifested in the opposition between the United States and our European partners, is not entirely correct. The current political and economic differences between France and Britain, and between Britain and Germany (West Germany), have also played a role." Some Western European countries have even risen up to "challenge the United States' leadership in the Western alliance" (U.S. "New York Herald Tribune"). The past year was actually a year in which the United States' "leadership" in the North Atlantic Group continued to be impacted by its "allies."

    After France's de Gaulle dropped a bomb by proposing the establishment of a "three-headed leadership core" of the United States, Britain, and France at the end of 1958, the quarrel over France's demand to share leadership with the United States and Britain has always been a "deep rift" in the North Atlantic Group. The United States, however, has always ignored de Gaulle's demands. De Gaulle did not give up. France initially demanded the joint management of nuclear warheads and the sharing of atomic secrets, and refused to allow the United States to establish missile bases and store nuclear weapons in France. Then, when the United States wanted the North Atlantic Group to merge the strategic air forces of various countries, France deliberately raised the bar. Afterwards, France broke the North Atlantic Group's regulations on unified command of the French fleet in the Mediterranean during wartime, and insisted that the French fleet must be controlled by France. Western newspapers pointed out that the core of all de Gaulle's demands is: to change the United States' "unrestricted dominance." Last year, Britain, taking advantage of the United States' dilemma on the West Berlin issue, also tried to seize the United States' "leadership responsibility" over the Western world. Macmillan's visit to Moscow despite U.S. warnings, and Marshal Montgomery, the retired deputy supreme commander of the North Atlantic Group,'s fierce criticism of U.S. leadership, are prominent examples. All of this once greatly annoyed the United States. Just as the famous American commentator Lippmann admitted: The United States is no longer the undisputed leader of the Western alliance. "Our views no longer prevail simply because we express them." Although Eisenhower personally visited Britain last August, the contradictions between the United States and Britain were still not completely resolved. Accompanying the surfacing of these major power conflicts, some small countries in the North Atlantic Group are now also demanding in a "clear and forceful" voice that "all allies should conduct full consultations." Italy has also demanded a greater say in Western policy decisions. All of this shows that the "leadership crisis" of the United States in the North Atlantic Group is further deepening.

    But the United States is not willing to lose its leadership. Reports on European policy by the U.S. House and Senate, as well as some influential figures, clamor that "the United States must implement more vigorous leadership." U.S. newspapers are also brandishing sticks, saying that Western European allies should not demand equal status due to the size of their strength. U.S. commentator Lippmann cried out: "As long as we bear the ultimate military responsibility, we cannot give up our ultimate diplomatic responsibility." Recently, "U.S. News & World Report" even openly advocated that Britain leave the road of empire and serve as a European partner to "follow the leadership of the United States." At the recent meeting of the North Atlantic Group Council, the United States stepped up its efforts to drive its "allies" to expand armaments, prepare for war, and implement military "integration" in an attempt to "incorporate its partners into the pyramid under the command of the United States." But in this regard, the United States still encounters considerable difficulties. Britain "is trying to get rid of the United States and gain independence in manufacturing nuclear weapons" (Associated Press). France is also strongly opposed to the U.S.'s attempt to strengthen control. French newspapers said in a provocative manner: the United States "cannot ask Europe to shoulder heavier burdens and responsibilities while refusing Europe to hold the key to its own defense." According to United Press International, de Gaulle recently stated: "It is essential that France defend itself by itself, for itself, and in its own way." In order to put pressure on France's attitude, at the North Atlantic Group military conference at the end of last year, U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Twining again attacked France, accusing France of undermining the North Atlantic Group. But Twining's attack caused an open conflict between the United States and France. Later, Eisenhower's meeting with de Gaulle in Paris also "failed to resolve any disputes" (Associated Press). It is precisely because of this acute contradiction that a recent Agence France-Presse report said that the more important issue in the future than the division of Western Europe into two groups is: the new relationship between Western European countries and the United States. This issue will be at the forefront of the capitalist world situation in 1960.

    Contending for Hegemony in Western Europe

    While the contradictions between the United States and its Western European "allies" are increasing in the imperialist camp, a struggle to seize European hegemony is also fiercely unfolding among Britain, West Germany, and France within Western Europe. The battle for the "second leading ally" among these countries began several years ago. West Germany, due to its strong economic strength and the support of the United States, occupies a dominant position. When West Germany and France formed the Bonn-Paris axis last year and established a "Common Market" with the other four Western European countries, greatly weakening Britain's economic power and political influence on the Western European continent, Adenauer said triumphantly that the British must know that it is no longer Britain but West Germany and France that are leading Western Europe. However, after Britain organized the "Little Free Trade Area" to counter the "Common Market" and used the German and West Berlin issues to restrain West Germany, it somewhat improved Britain's disadvantageous situation. After the British general election, the Conservative government gained a firm foothold and launched a series of "diplomatic offensives" against Western European countries. On the one hand, Britain attempted to make certain compromises with West Germany and France to force West Germany to make economic concessions, and at the same time used the "Western European Union" to allow Britain to intervene in the leadership affairs of the Western European continent. On the other hand, it tried to divide the "continental front" led by West Germany. Within the Bonn-Paris axis, although they still need to collude together in opposing the United States and Britain, because both France and West Germany want to serve as the leader of this axis and use it as a means to strive for their own great power status, a kind of "hidden, but undoubtedly existing distrust" (West German "Frankfurter Rundschau") has recently emerged in this axis. These Western European countries are competing with the United States for power on the one hand, and on the other hand they are using the power of the United States to suppress each other. The United States, in turn, uses the contradictions between them to consolidate its "leadership position." This makes the contradictions between imperialist countries even more complex.

    At present, imperialist countries are afraid that the international situation will continue to develop in a direction favorable to peace and unfavorable to imperialism, and they also want to strengthen the West's bargaining position before the East-West summit conference. From within the imperialist group, some countries are also making mutual compromises due to adjustments in relations. Therefore, in recent times, the contradictions among Western countries seem to have been somewhat reconciled on the surface. For example, there has been a clamor for stepping up arms expansion and war preparation and maintaining military balance at the recent meeting of the North Atlantic Group Council; there has been a retreat in the attitude of Britain and other Western countries towards the East-West summit conference; there has been joint manufacturing of munitions and missiles by Britain and West Germany, and the brewing of an arms cartel by Britain, France, and West Germany; there have been so-called proposals to "build bridges" between the "Common Market" and the "Little Free Trade Area," and so on. But all of this is actually just that Western countries are trying to take advantage of the opportunity to seek benefits for themselves. On the substantive issue of truly contending for political and economic dominance, even the U.S. "New York Times" admits that it is "fundamental, cannot be compromised, and even more cannot be resolved." It can be seen that the trend of imperialist countries gradually moving towards disintegration is inevitable.

### 北大西洋集团内部矛盾加深

    北大西洋集团内部矛盾加深
    席林生
    帝国主义的北大西洋集团内部矛盾日益加深。这种尖锐矛盾，特别明显地表现在美、英、法、西德几个主要国家的经济和外交斗争上面。
    矛盾发展的背景
    帝国主义主要国家之间的矛盾是在下面这样的背景之下进一步发展的。
    首先，随着东风进一步压倒西风，社会主义阵营日益强大，民族独立运动日益高涨，整个帝国主义阵营的困难越来越增加了。战后以来，已经将近三十个殖民地国家脱离了帝国主义的羁绊，取得了独立。其中不少国家更在发展自己的民族经济。帝国主义的地盘一天天缩小了。
    其次，1957年—1958年的经济危机席卷了整个资本主义世界。1958年资本主义世界的工业生产下降了2．5％，对外贸易值也下降了5％。去年以来资本主义国家采取了人为的措施，使它们的经济有了“缓慢的回升”（联合国欧洲经济委员会报告）。但是这种回升只是恢复到1957年的水平，并没有使资本主义国家的元气有很大恢复。从钢的生产来讲，美国和英国仍然比1957年减产二千多万吨。对于美国、英国和西德来说，煤矿业的情况更是“最坏的一年”。它们的产量去年比1958年下降了将近七千万吨。西德的鲁尔区堆积着销不出去的煤炭近一千八百万吨。对于许多资本主义国家来说，生产能力过剩、通货膨胀、失业、农业危机等等还是相当严重的问题。因此，就在西方报刊叫嚷“繁荣”的同时，联合国的经济报告就说，“在资本主义世界经济前景中仍有一些黑点。”而一些美国报刊，如“美国新闻与世界报道”更忧心忡忡地担心1961年将是战后美国企业下跌最严重的一年。美国总统艾森豪威尔在今年的经济报告中也承认新的经济危机仍旧是“全体美国人所担忧的问题。”资本主义国家都竭力想为解救自己的困难寻找出路。
    第三，资本主义各国经济发展的不平衡越来越明显。占资本主义世界经济力量一半的美国，在资本主义世界中的经济地位已经相对地削弱。而同时过去依赖于美国的西欧各国，特别是西德的经济实力已进一步加强。以工业生产来看，如果以1953年的工业生产水平为一百，到1958年西德已上升到151％，法国150％，英国114％。而美国却停留在100％；而到1959年，美国为111％，西德（十一个月）为161％，法国（九个月）则为153％，英国（十一个月）为120％。1958年美国的工业生产在资本主义世界中所占份额已经从1948年的56．4％下降到46．9％，在资本主义世界工业品出口总额中，美国所占比重也已从1950年的27％左右下降到1959年的22％左右，英国从25．6％下降到16．8％，而西德却从7．7％增加到19．3％。美国出口继续减少，进口不断增加，两年来在对外支付上出现了近七十四亿美元的巨大逆差，导致了大量的黄金外流。从1958年初到1959年年底，美国外流的黄金已达三十四亿四千万美元。西欧各国的黄金外汇储备却增加了三十八亿五千万美元，估计1959年西欧各国的黄金外汇储备总和将达到二百亿美元以上。这不仅使战后西欧各国的“美元荒”的情况消除了，而且大大动摇了美国的“金元帝国”的地位。美国新闻处不久前综述1959年世界经济形势时不得不哀叹：战后以来美国在世界市场上具有统治的经济力量的“整个时代结束了”。
    自从1957年世界力量对比发生了东风压倒西风的根本变化以后，美国在西方集团内就开始发生了严重的“信任危机”。随着美国经济实力的相对削弱，这种危机进一步深刻化。华盛顿的一些经济专家黯然叹息：“从长期说来，美国肯定将不得不正视这个基本问题：它已不再拥有贯彻它目前这样的世界‘领导’政策的手段了。”美国参议院外交委员会主席富布赖特所公布的一个半官方机构的美国欧洲政策的报告中也承认，目前在西欧正在造成一种“不要美国的新的自立思想”。西方集团内部政治和经济力量消长的变化，加剧了美国的西欧“盟国”同它争夺经济和政治的优势地位的斗争。
    无情的竞争
    帝国主义各国在经济上的斗争突出地表现在争夺投资势力范围的争夺上面。战后，美国乘着西欧各国的元气大伤，曾经节节渗入到“盟国”的势力范围。英国1950年在英联邦的投资总额还比美国大20％，1958年已经完全相等。在加拿大美国的投资更比英国高出四倍。在最剧烈的争夺中东石油战中，美国已压倒英国，1958年美国控制了中东石油的45．7％，而英国只有20％左右。美国也竭力在法国手上挖取殖民地。自从法国被美国逐出印度支那之后，美国又积极打入法国在北非的阵地。美国利用了摩洛哥、突尼斯反殖民主义的斗争，积极通过贷款进行渗透。1959年美国对摩洛哥、突尼斯的贷款达六千万美元。此外，美国更不顾法国的反对，向突尼斯供应了好几批军火。现在美国的石油托辣斯已经打入了法属北非最大的石油资源地的撒哈拉，取得了石油开采权，并且垄断了现在唯一通到突尼斯港口的油管。
    在帝国主义日益尖锐的经济竞争中，西德已经成为一个强有力的角逐者。1959年，西德对外投资已经从1952年的二千七百万马克增加到将近二十三亿马克。在拉丁美洲、中东和亚洲地区，西德都在进行有力的扩张。在中东，西德更乘英国侵埃战争失败的机会，跟美国一起，拼命填补英国的“真空”。
    英国和法国自然不肯轻易放弃自己的势力范围，竭力抵挡。英国力图加强自己对英联邦的控制，它利用美国海外收支的赤字和美元地位的削弱加紧对英镑区输出资本。法国对于美国资本流入北非也控制得特别严。1958年年底戴高乐政府颁布的“石油法规”规定外国在撒哈拉石油公司的50％的利润归法国。1959年法国又故意不批准美国新泽西美孚油公司开采石油的合同。法国的这些措施都曾经引起美国垄断资本的不满。
    争夺世界市场是帝国主义国家之间矛盾的另一个焦点。由于西欧各国经济力量不断增强，美国在世界市场上所感受到的竞争压力越来越大了。1959年上半年美国出口比1957年同期减少21．6％，而西欧国家却增加了2．7％。在1958年全年和1959年上半年，美国对西欧市场的出口比上一年分别降低了22％和10％，在拉丁美洲的出口比上年也分别降低了11％和15％。1959年上半年美国对拉丁美洲的贸易甚至出现了逆差。而一些西欧国家，特别是西德的出口却有了增长。在中东，美国在十二个主要国家对中东的输出额中所占比重，已从1948年的26％下降到1958年的21．6％。同时英国的比重从40．4％下降到24％，而西德的比重则由0．2％猛增到17．7％。不仅如此，现在西欧各国的商品也越来越猛烈地打进了美国一直保护得很严密的国内市场。去年头八个月美国从西德的进口比前年同期增加44％，法国增加60％，英国增加37％。西欧国家出口的小汽车已经夺占了8％以上的美国汽车市场。一些过去对美贸易一直入超的国家，如英国、西德在去年也一变而为出超。“美国新闻与世界报道”承认，由于“西欧的对手的进攻”，使得“美国企业占优势而且易于扩大市场的时代，已经为无情的竞争的时代所代替”。
    在同美国争夺市场的同时，西欧各国相互之间的竞争也日趋激烈。以西德为首的“共同市场”和以英国为首的“小自由贸易区”的两个排他性的经济集团已经形成，导致了西欧资本主义国家战后以来第一次公开的分裂。这两个经济集团和美国力量的对比可以从下面的表格中看出来：
    国别  人口（百万）在资本主义世界工业产量七所占％（1958年）
    在资本主义世界输出中所占％（1958年）
    “共同市场”六国        166     21．6   24．1
    西德　                  52．2　 10．05　9．4

    西欧市场对英国是一个仅次于英联邦的重要市场。“共同市场”六国容纳了英国出口的14％。因此，“共同市场”的成立对英国是一个严重的打击。现在英国组织“小自由贸易区”就是一方面弥补由于“共同市场”成立所造成的损失，另一方面也是对“共同市场”六国的报复性措施。因为对西德、荷兰、意大利来说，“小自由贸易区”也是它们的一个传统的市场。西德出口总额中有29％输往“共同市场”，而输往“小自由贸易区”的也达到27％，荷兰对“小自由贸易区”的出口占24％，意大利占17％。这就不能不使西欧各国的贸易战进一步尖锐化。目前虽然英国和一些国家竭力想在两个集团间建立“桥梁”，但是由于矛盾重重，始终无法解决。最近在欧洲十五国谘询议会上，英国外交大臣劳埃德更威胁说，如果共同市场严格采取保护主义政策的话，“那末西欧就会发生贸易战”，而“政治团结也就不会存在下去”。“这会严重地影响到北大西洋公约组织”。
    西欧两个经济集团的对垒，对于美国是极为不利的。美国对西欧的出口占美国出口总额的四分之一以上。而目前据西方报刊透露，由于美国对外贸易情况不妙，一方面美国不希望“六国”和“七国”尖锐对立，因为这两个集团彼此树立起来的贸易壁垒会使美国货受到排斥。但是另一方面美国又不希望这两个集团“联合起来”，把美国“关在门外”。美国为了对付这个局面，“准备把火力对准它的某些最好的盟国”（美联社）。美国已经向它的“盟国”催索偿还欠债。在去年召开的关税及贸易总协定会议上，美国负责经济事务的副国务卿狄龙再三以美国将恢复“保护主义和限制性行动”来威胁西欧国家取消对美货进口的限制。之后，狄龙又亲自去西欧“消除两个对立经济集团可能造成的对美国货输入西欧的障碍”，并且表示美国决定直接对两个经济集团的冲突“进行干预”。狄龙还向它的“盟国”施加压力，要它们拿出更多的“剩余”美元来分担对不发达国家的所谓“援助”。这样做，一方面可以在美国的控制下，纠合西方国家的力量，共同向不发达国家进行经济扩张，同时又可以减少“盟国”同美国竞争的资本。在1月12日至14日在巴黎举行的西方十三国经济会议上，美国竭力迫使西欧两个经济集团实行单方面放宽对美国货的入口限制，并要它们多担负对不发达国家的“援助”。但是这一次吵吵嚷嚷的会议，除了在程序问题上，例如成立有美国参加的委员会着手改组“欧洲经济合作局”；建立一个研究向“不发达国家”提供“援助”的小组等等达成了一些协议。而对一些实质问题，特别是西欧两个经济集团的冲突，会议只是决定“将来”开会研究。据报道，最近美国已准备发动一个“四十年来第一次的大规模推广输出运动”（美联社），以对付欧洲“盟国”的“日益剧烈的竞争”。正是由于它们之间的矛盾不可调和，几个主要资本主义国家的经济斗争必将继续发展下去。
    对美国领导地位的挑战
    帝国主义国家在经济上的这种尖锐的矛盾，不能不在政治上反映出来。美国一些报纸承认：由于西欧国家对美国的依靠的减少，使西方集团各国之间的关系复杂起来了。“许多国家和政府对别人不把自己当作一回事和受到像小伙计那样的对待已经感到厌倦”（美国“纽约时报”）。最近，美国众议院外交事务委员会发表的关于美国对欧洲政策报告中在承认社会主义国家团结一致的同时，不能不哀叹北大西洋集团内“存在深刻的不信任，甚至是冷淡的感情”。报告并说：“北大西洋公约组织内部不团结，要说只表现在美国同我们的欧洲伙伴之间的对立上，那是不完全的。法国和英国之间、英国和德国（西德）之间目前在政治和经济方面的分歧也起了影响”。甚至一些西欧国家已经起来向美国“在西方联盟中的领导地位提出挑战”（美国“纽约先驱论坛报”）。过去一年实际上是美国在北大西洋集团内“领导地位”继续不断受到“盟国”冲击的一年。
    1958年底，法国戴高乐提出建立美、英、法“三巨头领导核心”，向“盟主”美国投了一颗炸弹之后，法国要求和美英平分领导权的争吵一直成为北大西洋集团的一个“很深的裂口”。美国却一直对戴高乐的要求置之不理。戴高乐并不就此罢休。法国初则以共管核子弹头和分享原子秘密为要挟，不让美国在法国建立导弹基地和储藏核武器。接着美国要北大西洋集团合并各国的战略空军，法国又故意抬杠。之后，法国又破坏北大西洋集团关于战争时统一指挥法国在地中海舰队的规定，而坚持法国的舰队必须由法国来掌管。西方报刊指出，戴高乐这一切要求的核心就是：改变美国“丝毫不受限制的优势地位”。去年，英国也乘着美国在西柏林问题上进退两难的困境，力图夺取美国对西方世界的“领导责任”。麦克米伦曾不顾美国的警告去莫斯科访问，以及英国元帅、已退职的北大西洋集团最高副司令蒙哥马利猛烈抨击美国领导，都是突出的例子。这一切曾经使美国大为恼火。正像美国著名评论家李普曼所承认的：美国已经不复是西方联盟的无可置辩的领袖了。“我们的看法不再由于是我们发表的而占上风了”。去年8月艾森豪威尔虽然亲自访问英国，美英之间的矛盾仍然没有完全解决。伴随这些大国冲突的表面化，现在北大西洋集团中的一些小国也以“明白有力”的声音要求“所有的盟国都要进行充分的协商”。意大利并且还要求在西方政策决定中有更大的发言权。这一切表明美国在北大西洋集团中的“领导危机”正在进一步深刻化。
    但是美国却并不甘心丧失它的领导权。美国众议院和参议院的对欧洲政策报告，以及一些有势力人物叫嚷着“美国必须实行更有力的领导”。美国报刊也挥舞大棒说由于力量的大小，西欧盟国不应要求平等地位。美国评论家李普曼叫道：“只要我们负有最终的军事责任，我们就不能放弃我们的最终的外交责任。”最近“美国新闻与世界报道”更公开鼓吹英国离开帝国的道路而充当一个欧洲伙伴，以“追随美国的领导”。美国在不久前的北大西洋集团理事会会议上，加紧驱使它的“盟国”扩军备战和实行军事“一体化”，就是企图把它的伙伴“归并到美国发号施令的金字塔之下”。但是在这方面，美国还遇到不小的困难。英国“正在设法摆脱美国而取得制造核武器的独立”（美联社）。而法国对于美国加强控制的企图也竭力反对。法国的报纸以挑衅的姿态说道：美国“不能够要求欧洲在担负更重的负担和责任的同时，却又拒绝欧洲掌握自己防务的钥匙”。据合众国际社报道，戴高乐前不久曾经表示：“法国要靠它自己，为它自己和用它自己的方法来自卫，这是必不可少的。”为了向法国这种态度施加压力，去年年底北大西洋集团军事会议上，美国参谋长联席会议主席特文宁又向法国开刀，攻击法国破坏北大西洋集团。但是特文宁的攻击又使美法之间爆发了公开的冲突。后来艾森豪威尔亲自到巴黎同戴高乐进行的会谈也“未能解决任何纠纷”（美联社）。正是由于这种尖锐的矛盾，最近法新社的一则消息说，今后比西欧分裂为两个集团更形重要的问题是：西欧各国对美国的新关系。这一问题在1960年资本主义世界形势中将是最前列的问题。
    争夺西欧霸权
    在帝国主义阵营中美国和它西欧“盟国”矛盾增强的同时，在西欧内部，一场夺取欧洲霸权的斗争也在英国和西德、法国之间激烈展开。这些国家之间的“第二号盟主”的争夺战早在几年以前就开始了。西德由于经济实力雄厚，以及得到美国的支持，占据了优势的地位。当去年西德和法国组成波恩—巴黎轴心，并且同其他四个西欧国家建立起“共同市场”，大大削弱英国在西欧大陆的经济势力和政治影响之后，阿登纳曾经趾高气扬地说，英国人必须知道，现在领导西欧的已经不是英国，而是西德和法国了。但是后来在英国组织起对抗“共同市场”的“小自由贸易区”，并且利用了德国和西柏林问题挟制西德，才多少改善了一些英国的不利处境。当英国大选以后，保守党政府站稳脚跟，就向西欧大陆国家发动了一系列的“外交攻势”。英国一方面企图向西德和法国作某些妥协，迫使西德在经济上让步，同时利用“西欧联盟”使英国插足西欧大陆的领导事务。另一方面又力图分化以西德为主帅的“大陆阵线”。而在波恩—巴黎轴心内部，虽然目前在反对美、英两国还需要勾结一起，但是由于法国、西德都想充当这个轴心的首领，并且利用它作为争取自己的大国地位，因此近来在这个轴心之中也产生了一种“隐蔽的、但无疑是存在的不信任”（西德“法兰克福评论报”）。这些西欧国家一方面同美国争权，另一方面它们又借助美国的力量来压制对方。而美国又利用它们之间的矛盾来巩固自己的“领导地位”。这就使得帝国主义国家之间的矛盾更加错综复杂。
    目前帝国主义国家害怕国际局势继续向着有利于和平、不利于帝国主义的方向发展，同时也想在东西方最高级会议前加强西方讨价还价的地位；而从帝国主义集团内部来说，一些国家之间也由于调整关系而纷纷进行互相妥协。因此最近一个时期来，西方国家在某些问题上从表面看来，矛盾似乎有了某些调和。例如出现了在不久前北大西洋集团理事会会议上加紧扩军备战、保持军事均势的叫嚷；出现了英国和其他西方国家在东西方最高级会议上态度的后退，出现了英国和西德联合制造军火和导弹，以及英、法、西德三国酝酿组织军备卡特尔；出现了所谓在“共同市场”和“小自由贸易区”之间“搭起桥梁”的主张等等。但是这一切实际上不过是西方各国竭力利用时机来为自己谋求好处。在真正的争夺政治、经济支配权的实质问题上，连美国“纽约时报”也承认是“根本性的，无法折衷，更无法解决的。”可以看出，帝国主义国家逐步走向四分五裂的趋势是不可避免的。
