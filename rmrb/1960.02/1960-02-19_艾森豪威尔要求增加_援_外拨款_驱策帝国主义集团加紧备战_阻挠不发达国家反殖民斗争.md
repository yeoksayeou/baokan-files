Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 18th: U.S. President Eisenhower submitted a message to Congress on the 16th regarding the U.S.'s so-called "Mutual Security Program," also known as the "aid" program, for the 1961 fiscal year, requesting that Congress approve a larger amount of funds than the previous fiscal year to expand military and economic "aid" to foreign countries.

　　Eisenhower requested that $4,175 million be allocated for "aid" in the 1961 fiscal year, including $2 billion for military "aid" and $2,175 million for economic "aid." This amount is more than $953 million greater than the "aid" appropriation approved by the U.S. Congress in the previous fiscal year, with military "aid" increasing by $700 million.

　　In his message, Eisenhower repeatedly emphasized the importance of the United States expanding its military "aid" to foreign countries. He vigorously advocated for the imperialist camp's military strength to "remain strong" and to possess and maintain a "deterrent force." He told Congress that within the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, it was necessary to "maintain a strong and effective deterrent posture," to "provide more advanced weapons" to America's "allies," and to improve their armies. He said that the $2 billion in military "aid" appropriations he was requesting was the "minimum amount" and that all of this was "based on America's deepest self-interests."

　　In order to conceal America's war preparations, Eisenhower once again trotted out the slander of the so-called "communist imperialist threat." He clamored that "in the face of this ever-present communist threat, for our own interests and for the interests of other members of the free world family, we must continue to implement our military assistance program through the various common security arrangements we have established." He openly said that the fact that the Soviet Union was reducing its military manpower "does not change" the "necessity" for the United States and its allies to jointly step up their arms expansion and war preparations. Eisenhower himself confirmed in his message the U.S.'s conspiracy to continue playing the trick of false peace and genuine war preparations in the future. He believes that the U.S.'s future approach should be to expand its military strength "unswervingly, inconspicuously, and patiently" while engaging in negotiations. He said: "Weakening our common deterrent position would be extremely foolish."

　　As a supplementary means to direct military "aid," Eisenhower requested an appropriation of $724 million for so-called "defense support" in order to help some of its puppets maintain their crumbling economic situations due to huge military expenditures. He also requested that 56% of this amount be given to the Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, and Ngo Dinh Diem cliques.

　　Eisenhower once again expressed support for the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique in its hostility towards the Chinese people. He announced that, in addition to military "aid" and "defense support," the United States also intends to "fully provide grants and loan assistance" to the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

　　Eisenhower's message shows that the United States' economic "aid" to underdeveloped countries is full of ulterior motives. He said that "the accelerated attainment of independence by the people of Africa and the increasing instability of underdeveloped regions" are "new challenges" to the United States. He worried that this would bring "explosive threats." He said that the United States should take out dollars like an "investment" to help these countries "clarify (the direction of) development." Here, Eisenhower does not conceal that the real purpose of American "aid" to underdeveloped countries is to attempt to make these countries abandon anti-colonialism.

　　Eisenhower expressed satisfaction with the role played by the American-controlled "Development Loan Fund" in helping American private capital expand its activities in private enterprises in underdeveloped countries. He pointed out that in the past two years, a large portion of the "Development Loan Fund's" loans have been given to India and Pakistan. Eisenhower requested an appropriation of $700 million for the "Development Loan Fund" in the 1961 fiscal year.

　　He announced that the American-controlled "World Bank" is drafting a plan for the United States, Britain, and West Germany to jointly invest in the "development" of the Indus River basin between India and Pakistan. Eisenhower also showed great interest in expanding American influence in Africa through aid.

### 艾森豪威尔要求增加“援”外拨款  驱策帝国主义集团加紧备战  阻挠不发达国家反殖民斗争

    艾森豪威尔要求增加“援”外拨款
    驱策帝国主义集团加紧备战  阻挠不发达国家反殖民斗争
    新华社18日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔16日向国会提出了美国1961财政年度所谓“共同安全计划”、也就是“援”外计划的咨文，要求国会同意拨出比上一财政年度数目更大的款项，来扩大给外国的军事和经济“援助”。
    艾森豪威尔要求在1961财政年度里拨出“援”外款项四十一亿七千五百万美元，其中军事“援助”二十亿美元，经济“援助”二十一亿七千五百万美元。这笔款项比上一财政年度美国国会批准的“援”外拨款增加了九亿五千三百多万美元，其中军事“援助”增加七亿美元。
    艾森豪威尔在咨文中反复强调美国扩大对外军事“援助”的重要性。他竭力鼓吹要使帝国主义阵营军事力量“保持强大”，要拥有和保持“威慑力量”。他向国会说，要在北大西洋侵略集团内部“保持一种强大的有效的威慑阵势”，要向美国的“盟国”“提供比较先进的武器”并且改进它们的军队，他说，他所要求的二十亿美元的军事“援助”拨款是“最低数目”，并且说，所有这一切都是以美国的“最深切的自我利益为基础”的。
    为了掩饰美国的备战计划，艾森豪威尔再一次搬出所谓“共产帝国主义的威胁”的谰言。他叫嚣说：“在面临这种始终存在的共产主义威胁的情况下，为了我们自身的利益以及自由世界大家庭其他成员的利益，我们必须通过我们已经建立的各种共同安全安排继续执行我们的军事援助计划。”他公然说，苏联裁减军事人力的事实“并不能改变”美国和它的盟国共同加紧扩军备战的“必要性”。艾森豪威尔在咨文中自己证实了美国今后要继续玩弄假和平真备战的阴谋。他认为，美国今后的做法应该是，在进行谈判的同时，要“坚定不移地、不事声张地、耐心地”扩充它的军事力量。他说：“削弱我们的共同威慑力量地位是极为愚蠢的。”
    作为直接军事“援助”的补充手段，艾森豪威尔要求拨出七亿二千四百万美元所谓“防御支持费”，以便帮助它的一些仆从们维持由于支出巨大的军费而摇摇欲坠的经济局面。他并且要求把其中的56％的数目给予蒋介石、李承晚和吴庭艳集团。
    艾森豪威尔再次表明支持台湾蒋介石集团同中国人民为敌。他宣布，除了军事“援助”和“防御支持”以外，美国还打算向蒋介石集团“充分提供赠款和贷款援助”。
    艾森豪威尔的咨文表明，美国对不发达地区国家的经济“援助”居心叵测。他说什么“非洲人民加速取得独立，不发达地区愈来愈动荡不定”，是对美国的“新的挑战”。他担心这会带来“爆炸性的威胁”。他说，美国要像“投资”一样地拿出美元来帮助这些国家“明确（发展）方向”。在这里，艾森豪威尔并不隐讳，美“援”对不发达国家的真正目的是企图使这些国家放弃反殖民主义。
    艾森豪威尔对美国“开发贷款基金会”在帮助美国私人资本在不发达国家的私人企业中扩大活动方面所起的作用表示满意。他指出，在过去两年中，“开发贷款基金会”中的一大部分贷款是给予印度和巴基斯坦的。艾森豪威尔要求在1961财政年度拨款七亿美元供“开发贷款基金会”使用。
    他宣布，美国控制的“世界银行”正在拟订由美国、英国、西德共同出资“开发”印巴之间的印度河流域的计划。艾森豪威尔还对于通过援助扩大美国在非洲的势力表现了很大兴趣。
