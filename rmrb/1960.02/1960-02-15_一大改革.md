Editor's Note:

    Hog raising must continue to develop greatly. At the current general level of feeding management, one breeder raises an average of 25 hogs. Will it be possible for breeders to increase their average in this way in the future? Obviously not. The only way out is to improve the level of feeding. A major reform must be carried out in hog-raising technology to meet the needs of the current high-speed development of the collective hog-raising industry. The method of feeding hogs in large troughs in a concentrated manner adopted by the Tianjin Industrial and Agricultural Alliance Animal Husbandry Farm is an innovation of great significance, because the breeders have effectively organized the scattered actions of feeding hogs. For example, in the past, when hogs were raised in single pens, the breeders were busy carrying water, chopping feed, and cooking feed, and then carrying the hog feed to each pen and trough, busy all day long, and one person could only raise twenty or thirty hogs at most. Now? These scattered labors are highly organized: water pumps send water directly into the pot, and feed is also chopped from the storage room and put directly into the pot, and the cooked hog feed is poured into the feeding trough nearby, which can feed 200 hogs at a time. The work efficiency of the breeders has been greatly improved, and the labor intensity has also been relatively reduced. The high-speed development of the hog-raising industry is the policy of our Party. Concentrated feeding in large troughs not only solves the ideological concerns of agriculture and animal husbandry competing for labor, but also finds an advanced feeding management method for large-scale collective hog-raising industry.

    一大改革
    养猪事业还要继续大发展。按目前一般的饲养管理水平，一个饲养员平均养猪二十五头。将来饲养员能不能这样平均递增呢？显然不可能。唯一的出路是提高饲养水平。要在养猪饲养技术上来一个大改革，才能适应当前集体养猪事业高速度发展的需要。天津市工农联盟畜牧场采用大槽集中喂猪的办法，所以是一项有重大意义的革新，因为饲养员同志把分散的喂猪动作加以有效的组织起来。譬如，以前单圈养猪，饲养员忙着挑水、切料、煮料，然后挑着猪食挨圈逐槽去分，一天忙到晚，一个人也顶多养二、三十头猪；现在呢？这些分散的劳动高度组织起来了：抽水机把水直接送入锅里，饲料也从贮藏间切碎、直接投入锅中，煮好的猪食就近倒入食槽，一次可以供两百头猪吃。饲养员的工作效率大大提高，劳动强度也相对地减轻了。高速度发展养猪业是我们党的方针。大槽集中喂食，既解决了农牧业争劳力的思想顾虑，又为大规模集体养猪业找到了一条先进的饲养管理方法。
