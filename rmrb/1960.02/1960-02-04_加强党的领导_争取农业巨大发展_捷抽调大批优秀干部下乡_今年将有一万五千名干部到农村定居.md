Czechoslovakia has been transferring a large number of outstanding Communist Party members and agricultural experts to work in rural areas since the beginning of this year.

This work is being carried out in accordance with the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee's December resolution on strengthening grassroots cadres in rural areas. The purpose is to strengthen the Party's leadership over agriculture, replenish grassroots cadres in rural areas, and strive for a huge development in agricultural production this year.

The resolution of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee pointed out that it is necessary to better utilize large-scale production methods and adopt more technology in rural areas in order to achieve a fundamental transformation of agricultural production, requiring grassroots cadres who directly lead production to have higher political and professional levels. Therefore, the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee decided to transfer excellent cadres from the central, state, and county Party organizations, from agricultural and scientific research departments, and other agencies to rural areas to help with work. The Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee also designated January of this year as "Direct Assistance to Rural Areas Month," and the work of transferring cadres to the countryside began on the first day of 1960.

This year, 15,000 cadres will settle in rural areas and provide long-term assistance to rural areas. Another 15,000 to 20,000 cadres will be sent to rural areas for short-term work. These cadres sent to rural areas will serve as political, organizational, and technical leaders of agricultural cooperatives, state farms, and machine tractor stations. Some Communist Party members will serve as secretaries of township Party organizations, and more than 6,000 Communist Party members nationwide will be transferred to this position.

While dispatching a large number of cadres to support rural areas, the Czechoslovak Communist Party is also paying close attention to training the original grassroots cadres in rural areas. This year, one-year and two-year training courses are specially set up in agricultural schools or agricultural technical schools to train experienced cadres in rural areas. Some chairmen of agricultural cooperatives will also be sent to "Agricultural Cooperative Chairman Training Classes" for study. Four-year and two-year agricultural technical schools will also undertake more rural cadre training work.

Currently, the cadres sent to rural areas are working with the original cadres to lead farmers in discussing the Third Five-Year Plan and formulating this year's production plan. Under their active leadership, a vigorous socialist competition has been launched among agricultural cooperatives. The vast majority of cooperatives nationwide have made guarantees to complete and overfulfill this year's production tasks. State farms and tractor stations have also made guarantees.

    加强党的领导　争取农业巨大发展
    捷抽调大批优秀干部下乡
    今年将有一万五千名干部到农村定居
    捷克斯洛伐克从今年年初以来陆续抽调大批优秀的共产党员和农业专家到农村去工作。
    这一工作是根据捷共中央去年12月关于增强农村基层干部的决议进行的，其目的在于加强党对农业的领导，充实农村的基层干部，以争取农业生产在今年的巨大发展。
    捷共中央的决议指出，在农村中要更好地利用大生产的形式、更多地采用技术，以达到农业生产的根本性转折，要求直接领导生产的基层干部具有更高的政治和业务水平。因此，捷共中央决定从中央、各州和县党组织，从农业和科学研究部门以及其它机关中抽调优秀干部去农村帮助工作。捷共中央并把今年1月定为“直接帮助农村月”，抽调干部下乡的工作从1960年的第一天起就开始进行。
    今年将有一万五千名干部到农村去定居，长期帮助农村进行工作。还有一万五千名到二万名干部将被派往农村，进行短期的工作。这些派往农村的干部将分别担任农业合作社、国营农场以及机器拖拉机站的政治、组织和技术领导工作。有些共产党员将担任乡党组织的书记，全国将有六千名以上的共产党员被调去担任这一职务。
    在派出大批干部支援农村的同时，捷共也十分注意培养农村原有的基层干部。今年在农业学校或农业技术学校中特设置一年制和二年制的训练班，培养农村中有经验的干部。还有一些农业合作社的主席将陆续送往“农业合作社主席训练班”学习。四年制和二年制的农业技术学校也将更多地担任农村干部的培养工作。
    目前派往农村的干部正和原有的干部一道领导农民讨论第三个五年计划和制订今年的生产计划。在他们的积极领导下，农业合作社之间掀起了轰轰烈烈的社会主义竞赛。全国绝大部分的合作社都提出了完成和超额完成今年生产任务的保证。国营农场和拖拉机站也都提出了保证。
