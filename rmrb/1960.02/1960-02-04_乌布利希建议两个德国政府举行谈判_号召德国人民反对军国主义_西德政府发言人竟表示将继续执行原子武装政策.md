    Ulbricht Suggests Two German Governments Hold Negotiations
    Calls on German People to Oppose Militarism
    West German Government Spokesman Actually Says Atomic Armament Policy Will Continue

    BERLIN - On January 28, the First Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Ulbricht, held a press conference. At the conference, Ulbricht said that he suggests that the Bonn government and the government of the German Democratic Republic should hold negotiations within fourteen days to discuss issues such as stopping the "Cold War," abandoning atomic armament and rocket bases, concluding a treaty of non-aggression, and reaching an agreement on the number of troops and their deployment locations.
    Ulbricht made these remarks when referring to a recent letter he sent to West German Chancellor Adenauer. He revealed that the Bonn General Staff has a secret plan to launch a war of aggression against the German Democratic Republic, which was revealed by a document on the basic policy of conducting atomic warfare. The German Democratic Republic intends to publish the details of this secret plan. He said that the aim of the Adenauer government and the Bonn militarists is to take the leading position within NATO in 1960-1961, in order to ensure the success of their aggression plans.
    Ulbricht then said that the numerous military exercises conducted by West Germany in 1959 clearly showed that it was engaged in preparations for a war of aggression. The secret plan for a war of aggression is completely consistent with Strauss's statement at the NATO Paris conference, where he demanded strict adherence to NATO's plan to intensify atomic armament.
    Speaking on the issue of the "emergency law" recently passed in West Germany, Ulbricht said that Bonn's emergency law had already been implemented during West Germany's large-scale military exercises, even though the Federal Parliament had not yet reviewed the draft law. Therefore, it is obvious that in Bonn, power is in the hands of the Federal Defense Council, not the Federal Parliament.
    Ulbricht pointed out that another example of the resurgence of fascism in West Germany is that the notorious armored forces general and SS leader Meyer openly claimed that the SS backbone is the pillar of the Federal Army. Former secret police officials are also receiving special training. Bonn is relying on former Nazi officers and paramilitary organizations to carry out its plans.
    Ulbricht called on all peace-loving Germans to reach an understanding and oppose militarism and fascism. However, according to Western newspapers, a West German government spokesman unreasonably rejected the suggestions in Ulbricht's letter a few days ago. The spokesman also stated that West Germany's peace-endangering policy of atomic armament "will continue to be implemented."

    BERLIN (Xinhua) - On January 29, West German troops and American troops stationed in West Germany began provocative atomic offensive exercises in West Germany, about one hundred kilometers from the border of the German Democratic Republic.
    A total of 60,000 West German and American troops participated in the exercise held in the Grafenwöhr and Hohenfels areas of Upper Palatinate. The West German authorities have continuously conducted provocative military exercises in the past, and this exercise is a continuation of such exercises named "Black Lion" and "Dodge."

### 乌布利希建议两个德国政府举行谈判  号召德国人民反对军国主义  西德政府发言人竟表示将继续执行原子武装政策

    乌布利希建议两个德国政府举行谈判
    号召德国人民反对军国主义
    西德政府发言人竟表示将继续执行原子武装政策
    本报讯　1月28日德意志民主共和国第一副总理乌布利希举行了记者招待会。在会上，乌布利希说，他建议，波恩政府和德意志民主共和国政府应该在十四天之内举行谈判，以讨论停止“冷战”、放弃原子武装和火箭基地、缔结互不侵犯条约以及就军队的人数和驻扎地点达成协议等问题。
    乌布利希是在谈到他最近给西德总理阿登纳的一封信时说这番话的。他揭露说，波恩总参谋部有一个准备向德意志民主共和国发动侵略战争的秘密计划，这是由一个关于进行原子战争的基本方针的文件所透露的。德意志民主共和国打算公布这个秘密计划的细节。他说，阿登纳政府和波恩军国主义者的目的，是要在1960到1961年在北大西洋公约组织内居首要地位，以便保证他们的侵略计划能够成功。
    乌布利希接着说，1959年西德的多次军事演习，已经明显地表明了它在从事侵略战争的准备。侵略战争的秘密计划完全同施特劳斯在北大西洋公约组织巴黎会议上的声明一致，他在会上要求严格遵循北大西洋公约组织加紧进行原子武装的计划。
    在谈到西德最近通过的“紧急状态法”问题时，乌布利希说，波恩的紧急状态法早在西德举行大规模军事演习期间就实施了，虽然联邦议院还没有审议这项法律的草案。因此显而易见，在波恩，大权在手的是联邦防务委员会，而不是联邦议院。
    乌布利希指出，法西斯主义在西德重新抬头的又一例证是：臭名远扬的装甲车部队将军、党卫军组织头子迈耶，公然声称党卫军骨干是联邦军队的支柱。前秘密警察的官员也在受着特殊的训练。波恩正依靠前纳粹军官和半军事性组织来执行自己的计划。
    乌布利希号召所有爱好和平的德国人达成谅解，反对军国主义和法西斯主义。但是据西方报刊报道，前几天西德政府发言人已无理拒绝乌布利希信中的建议。这位发言人并且表示，西德危害和平的原子武装政策“将继续执行下去”。
    据新华社柏林电　西德军队和美国在西德的驻军1月29日在西德距离德意志民主共和国边境约一百公里的地方开始举行挑衅性的原子进攻演习。
    共有六万名西德和美国军队参加这次在上法尔茨的格拉芬乌尔和霍恩菲尔斯地区举行的演习。西德当局过去不断进行挑衅性的军事演习，这次演习就是以“黑狮”和“闪避”命名的这种演习的继续。
