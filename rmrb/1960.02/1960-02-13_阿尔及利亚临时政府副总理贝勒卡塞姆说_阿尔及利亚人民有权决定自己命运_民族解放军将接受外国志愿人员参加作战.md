Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 11th. Algerian Republic Provisional Government Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Belkacem said at a press conference here today that the Algerian people must have full freedom to decide their own destiny. They will never accept "self-determination" implemented under the supervision of the French army, nor will they accept the partition of Algeria.

Belkacem also serves as the head of the Inter-Ministerial Committee of the Ministry of Defense of the Algerian Provisional Government. He said that Algeria's military capabilities and combat technology have greatly improved, and the number of casualties in the Algerian National Liberation Army is now lower than last year.

The Algerian Deputy Prime Minister, who arrived here earlier today from Tunisia, said that at the recent All-Africa People's Conference in Tunis, the Algerian issue received more prominence than any other issue, because the African people understand the importance of the Algerian struggle. When a reporter asked whether the recent fascist riots in the French-occupied areas of Algeria would affect the Algerian revolution, the Deputy Prime Minister said that this situation makes it necessary for the people to be vigilant, but the position of the Algerian people remains unchanged. They adhere to the principles stated in the statements issued by the Algerian government on September 28 and November 20 last year.

Answering another question, Belkacem said that the Algerian National Liberation Army will accept foreign volunteers to join its ranks in combat.

He also said that the General Headquarters of the Algerian National Liberation Army has been established on Algerian soil, and the name of the commander-in-chief will be announced at an appropriate time.

Belkacem also said that he will stay in Cairo to perform his duties as Foreign Minister.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 11th. According to a military communique issued tonight by the headquarters of the Algerian National Liberation Army, the Algerian National Liberation Army engaged in fierce fighting with the French army on February 7, killing 147 French officers and soldiers and wounding 114 in one day.

The communique said that on February 7, the French army also lost two aircraft and seven military vehicles.

The communique also said that on this day, the Algerian National Liberation Army attacked 32 French military positions in six military regions of Algeria, engaged the enemy in three encounters, and ambushed French troops and military convoys six times.

The Algerian National Liberation Army demolition teams also attacked French military facilities and the farms of extreme colonialists.

The communique concluded that 21 enemy soldiers defected with weapons; the Algerian National Liberation Army seized 140 various weapons and a large amount of ammunition.
