    Luminescent Pencil
    (Our report) To meet the special needs of certain industrial sectors and field exploration departments for nighttime work, the Beijing Sanxing Pencil Factory, with the assistance of the Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has recently successfully trial-produced a "luminescent pencil."
    The lead core of this luminescent pencil is made of several specially made luminescent materials and is orange-yellow in color. It is housed in a movable metal rod, about the same size as a regular pencil.
    Graphics or writing created with this luminescent pencil on various papers can be recognized during the day. After being excited by ultraviolet light, sunlight, or ordinary light, it can emit light in the dark. The darker the surroundings, the clearer and brighter the drawings and writings become.

    夜光铅笔
    本报讯　为了满足某些工业部门和野外勘测部门夜间工作的特殊需要，北京市三星铅笔厂最近在中国科学院物理研究所协助下，试制成功一种“夜光铅笔”。
    这种夜光铅笔的铅芯是用几种特制的发光原料制成的，呈桔黄色，装在和一般铅笔大小差不多的活动金属杆内。
    用这种夜光铅笔在各种纸上绘制图形或书写成文字，在白天也可辨认；经过紫外线、日光或一般灯光照射激发以后，即能在黑暗中发光，光线越是黑暗，绘制和书写的痕迹就越清晰明亮。
