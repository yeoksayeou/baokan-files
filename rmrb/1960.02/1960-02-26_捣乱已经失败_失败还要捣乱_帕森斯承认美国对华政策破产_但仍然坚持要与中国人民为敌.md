Xinhua News Agency, February 25th, Milwaukee dispatch: U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Parsons delivered a speech on the 19th to the Wisconsin Bar Association regarding U.S. policy toward the Far East, particularly towards China.

Parsons admitted that despite the United States’ efforts over the past decade to strangle the new China or to contain the development of its power and influence, "Communist China has developed into a powerful economic and political force," and "we must accept this fact." He also said, "Indeed, all Americans must understand" such a prospect: "In the new decade of the sixties, Communist China is likely to become even more powerful." Parsons indicated that the U.S. ruling clique had not abandoned its delusion of subverting the new China's people's regime, saying that "although this regime appears to be consolidated," the possibility of it "collapsing from within" "cannot be ruled out."

Parsons tried his best to defend the U.S. policy toward China. He fabricated, turning black into white, that the unpopular U.S. policy toward China was caused by China's "threat" and "aggression." However, he then vigorously emphasized that the United States must seize the Southeast Asian region, "cannot shirk its responsibility," and must insist on forcibly occupying China's territory of Taiwan. However, he could not but admit that the U.S. policy toward China was becoming increasingly unpopular, saying, "I am unwilling to deny that our policy toward China—at least some fundamental aspects of this policy, such as our opposition to admitting the Peking regime into the United Nations—is unpopular in some countries."

Faced with the situation where the current U.S. policy toward China has fallen into a serious crisis, Parsons had to raise the question: "What is the future" of the U.S. policy toward China? Parsons admitted that his audience "will point out that there is no real solution to our problem in sight. Communist China exists and is growing stronger. We cannot ignore or turn a blind eye to 600 million Chinese people. You may suggest that therefore we must have a new policy." He mentioned many criticisms of the current U.S. policy toward China and the fact that "in the past few months, many widely publicized suggestions for formulating a new policy toward China have been put forward from all sides."

Parsons particularly mentioned the proposition of some bourgeois politicians in the United States who suggested that the U.S. government pursue a "two Chinas" policy. The essence of this proposition is to exchange the "recognition" of the new China for the legalization of the U.S. occupation of Taiwan. The common point between this proposition and the current policy of the U.S. government is the occupation of Taiwan, the difference being that the U.S. government refuses to recognize the new China. For a long time, the U.S. government has been trying to create two Chinas, that is, to prop up the Taiwan Kuomintang group everywhere to confront the new China, whose international influence is increasing, in an attempt to legalize the U.S. occupation of Taiwan and weaken the influence of the new China. Parsons admitted that the U.S. plot to create "two Chinas" had not succeeded, and it was first met with resolute opposition from the Chinese people. He said, "The Chinese Communists have repeatedly demonstrated in every conceivable way that they will never accept such a proposal." Parsons also mentioned that the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan also "fiercely opposed" the "two Chinas" policy. He believes that the fact that both the Chinese people's regime and the Chiang Kai-shek group cannot accept the concept of "two Chinas" is "a fundamental weakness" of the "two Chinas" policy proposition.

However, Parsons did not indicate in his speech that the United States was prepared to abandon its policy of supporting the Chiang Kai-shek group to oppose the new China. On the contrary, he indicated that he would continue to vigorously support the Chiang Kai-shek group in being hostile to the Chinese people. He tried his best to promote the Chiang Kai-shek group, boasting that the Chiang Kai-shek group was more representative of the "feelings and thoughts" of the broad masses of the Chinese people, and was "a truly Chinese, popular center that can replace (Beijing)."

Parsons concluded that he agreed with the conclusion of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund's report on U.S. foreign policy, that is, in terms of policy toward China, "in the short term, the various policies available lack creative possibilities."

Despite the failure of the current U.S. policy toward China, Parsons still shouted, "The mere fact that we cannot prevent Communist China from increasing its absolute strength does not mean that we should abandon a policy of seeking to offset this growth in strength; especially should we not take measures that might promote this growth in strength." He defended the current policy toward China, saying, "Our policy toward China cannot be viewed in isolation," it "has reorganized the balance of power in this vast region." "We must now be careful to prevent other alternative policies from shaking this balance. In the current situation, other policies can only bring disaster to the cause of freedom."

Parsons also indicated that the United States will intensify its implementation of the policy against the new China, and regard opposing the new China as the center of the U.S. aggressive policy in the Far East. He vigorously emphasized the military nature of the U.S. policy toward this region, emphasizing that first of all, a "deterrent force" against China must be maintained in this region. He pointed out that for this purpose, "we (the United States) maintain bases and naval forces in this region" in order to "quickly use our strength to deal with various situations"; "We provide military assistance to local troops through our military assistance programs," and have concluded bilateral military treaties with Japan, the Philippines, the Syngman Rhee clique, and the Chiang Kai-shek group, and organized the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

Parsons also believes that in order to deal with the new China, it is necessary to lure Asian countries economically with "aid" as bait, and politically provoke these countries' relations with China.

### 捣乱已经失败　失败还要捣乱  帕森斯承认美国对华政策破产  但仍然坚持要与中国人民为敌

    捣乱已经失败　失败还要捣乱
    帕森斯承认美国对华政策破产
    但仍然坚持要与中国人民为敌
    新华社25日讯　美国密尔窝基消息：美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿帕森斯19日在威斯康星律师协会发表了一篇关于美国对远东政策、特别是对华政策的演说。
    帕森斯承认，尽管美国十年多来竭力想扼杀新中国或者遏制新中国力量和影响的发展，“共产党中国已经发展成为一个强大的经济和政治力量”，“我们必须接受这个事实”。他还说，“的确，必须使所有美国人都了解”这样一种前景：“在六十年代的新的十年中，共产党中国很可能更加强大”。帕森斯表明，美国统治集团并未放弃颠覆新中国人民政权的妄想，说什么“虽然这个政权看起来是巩固的”，“但是不能排斥”它“从内部崩溃”的可能性。
    帕森斯竭力为美国对华政策辩护。他颠倒黑白地捏造美国的不得人心的对华政策是由于中国的“威胁”和“侵略”所引起的。但是，他接着竭力强调美国必须抓住东南亚地区，“不能推卸责任”，且要坚持武力霸占中国的领土台湾。但是，他不能不承认美国的对华政策越来越不得人心，他说，“我不愿否认我们的对华政策——至少是这个政策的某些基本方面，例如我们反对接纳北平政权进入联合国——在某些国家不受欢迎”。
    面对着美国现行对华政策已经陷入严重危机的情况，帕森斯不得不提出一个问题：美国对华政策的“前途如何”。帕森斯承认，他的听众“会指出，还看不到我们的问题会得到什么真正的解决。共产党中国存在着，而且日益强大。我们不能无视或者掉头不顾六亿中国人。你们也许会建议，因此我们必须有一项新政策”。他提到了美国现行对华政策遭到的许多批评以及这样一个事实：“过去几个月里，各方面提出了许多广为宣传的制定一项新的对华政策的建议”。
    帕森斯特别谈到美国国内一部分资产阶级政客建议美国政府奉行“两个中国”政策的主张。这种主张的实质是以“承认”新中国来换取美国霸占台湾的合法化。这个主张同美国政府现行的政策的共同点是霸占台湾，区别在于美国政府拒绝承认新中国。美国政府许久以来就力图制造两个中国，即到处抬出台湾国民党集团来同国际影响日益扩大的新中国对抗，妄图使美国占领台湾合法化，并且削弱新中国的影响。帕森斯承认，美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋并没有成功，它首先遭到了中国人民的坚决反对。他说，“中国共产党人以一切想得到的方式一再表明，他们决不会接受这样一个建议”。帕森斯还提到台湾蒋介石集团也“激烈反对”“两个中国”政策。他认为，中国人民政权和蒋介石集团都完全不能接受“两个中国”的观念是“两个中国”政策的主张的“一个基本弱点”。
    但是帕森斯在他的演说中丝毫没有表示美国准备放弃扶持蒋介石集团来反对新中国的政策。相反，他表示将继续大力支持蒋介石集团与中国人民为敌。他竭力为蒋介石集团宣传，胡吹蒋介石集团更能代表中国广大人民的“感情和思想”，是“一个可以替代（北京）的、真正中国的、人心所向的中心”。
    帕森斯的结论是：他同意洛克菲勒兄弟基金会关于美国外交政策的报告的结论，就是在对华政策方面“在短时期内，可供选择的各种政策都缺少创造的可能性”。
    尽管美国现行对华政策已经失败，帕森斯仍然叫喊说，“仅仅由于我们不能阻止共产党中国增加它的绝对力量这一事实，并不意味着我们便应放弃一项谋求抵消这种力量增长的政策；尤其不应采取可能促使这种力量增长的措施”。他为现行的对华政策辩护说，“我们的对华政策是不能孤立看待的”，它“重整了这个广大地区的均势”。“我们现在必须要注意防止用其他可供选择的政策来动摇这种均势。在目前情况下，其他政策只可能给自由事业带来大祸。”
    帕森斯还表明，美国将变本加厉地执行反对新中国的政策，把反对新中国作为美国在远东侵略政策的中心。他竭力强调，美国对这个地区的政策的军事性，强调首先必须在这个地区保持针对中国的“威慑力量”。他指出，为了这一目的，“我们（美国）在这个地区保持基地和海军力量”，以便“迅速利用我们的力量以应付各种局势”；“我们通过我们的军事援助计划向当地部队提出军事援助”，同日本、菲律宾、李承晚集团和蒋介石集团缔结了双边军事条约并且组织了东南亚条约组织。
    帕森斯还认为，为了对付新中国，必须在经济上以“援助”为钓饵拉拢亚洲国家，在政治上挑拨这些国家同中国的关系。
