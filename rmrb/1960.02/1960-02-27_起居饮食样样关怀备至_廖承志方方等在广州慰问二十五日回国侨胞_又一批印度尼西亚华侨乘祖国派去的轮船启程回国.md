Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 26th. Liao Chengzhi, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and Chairman of the Reception and Placement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China, visited overseas Chinese returnees from Indonesia in Guangzhou on the morning of the 26th.
    Accompanying Liao Chengzhi were Fang Fang, Vice Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and Member of the Reception and Placement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China; Zhuang Xiquan; Lian Guan, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Huang Changshui and Zhuang Mingli, Vice Directors of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission; Wang Yuanxing, Vice Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of Guangdong Province; Zhong Qingfa, Director of the Guangzhou Office of the Reception and Placement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China; and Xia Lin, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of Yunnan Province.
    Liao Chengzhi and the others went to each room in the Guangzhou Sanyuanli Overseas Chinese Guesthouse, extending warm welcomes and sincere greetings to the Indonesian overseas Chinese who had returned on the 25th, and inquired about their living and dietary conditions. The deep concern of the people of the motherland deeply moved the overseas Chinese. An Indonesian returnee surnamed Huang excitedly said to Liao Chengzhi: "We heard your voices overseas long ago, and these voices encouraged and comforted millions of overseas Chinese. Today, as soon as we returned to the country, you came to see us. The motherland is really concerned about the overseas Chinese in every possible way."
    Liao Chengzhi also visited the dining hall and bathrooms to learn about the living conditions of the returnees. The returnees were excited to hear that Liao Chengzhi and others had come to visit and gathered in the square to welcome them. Zhu Nanteng, a seventy-eight-year-old returnee from Medan who had spent decades overseas as a street performer, tightly grasped the hands of Liao Chengzhi and Fang Fang, saying that he would like to offer his medical secrets to the motherland. He also excitedly performed martial arts for the relatives from the motherland. Liao Chengzhi also gave instructions on the work of the reception staff.
    In the afternoon, Liao Chengzhi, Fang Fang, and others visited overseas Chinese students who had returned on the 25th at the Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Students' Middle School Preparatory School. Liao Chengzhi encouraged the returned overseas Chinese students to study hard, master their skills, and work better for the socialist motherland in the future.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 26th. More than 1,650 displaced overseas Chinese in Indonesia embarked today on the Chinese government-sent ships "Russia" and "Yakutia" to return to their homeland from Jakarta. A total of 3,800 displaced overseas Chinese have now left Indonesia to return to their homeland.
    Chinese Ambassador Huang Zhen, staff members of the Chinese Embassy and Consulate General, and representatives of the Federation of Chinese Associations braved the rain to see them off at the port.
    The overseas Chinese on board the "Russia" made large banners last night and hung them on both sides of the ship. The banners read: "Thank you for your help" and "Let's meet again in the motherland." These persecuted overseas Chinese were overjoyed today, braving the rain on deck to bid farewell to the people on shore. Everywhere were shouts of slogans, applause, and singing. They sang "People of the World are of One Mind" and "Ode to the Motherland" while clapping and waving their hands. The people seeing them off warmly wished them a safe journey, and continued to wave even when the two ships were almost out of sight.
    These displaced overseas Chinese began boarding yesterday afternoon. The boarding and luggage loading work was not completed until this morning, and it rained heavily all night. However, the staff of the Embassy and Consulate General, members of the Federation of Chinese Associations, Indonesian dockworkers, sailors, and staff members on the ship worked through the night in the rain to help the overseas Chinese move their luggage.
    A health work team composed of overseas Chinese students and housewives in Jakarta also worked there from morning to late at night. Female health workers braved the heavy rain to carry patients onto the ship on stretchers. Young students were also busy providing various services to their compatriots.
    Indonesian dockworkers, soaked to the bone, took off their shirts and continued working. An Indonesian crane operator had finished work and was preparing to go home, but when he heard on his way home that he was needed, he hurried back and continued working in the rain for twelve hours.
    The displaced overseas Chinese were deeply moved by such warm and meticulous care.
    As the ships left the port, the overseas Chinese shouted "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people" and sang "People of the World are of One Mind" and "Ode to the Motherland," deeply reflecting their feelings and sentiments.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 25th. A group of displaced overseas Chinese began boarding the ships "Russia" and "Yakutia," sent by the Chinese government to transport overseas Chinese back to their homeland, at noon today.
    These overseas Chinese came from Karawang in West Java and the Su-Yin region. The elderly and children among them were escorted to the ship by health workers composed of housewives from overseas Chinese families in Jakarta, and the ship's staff helped them board.
    These overseas Chinese who had lost their livelihoods were extremely excited and moved to see the complete equipment and clean, comfortable beds inside the cabins.
    Huang Zhen, Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia, Counselor Liu Yufeng, and Cultural Counselor Sima Wensen, and others visited the crew members and accompanying staff on the "Russia" and "Yakutia" today.

    廖承志还到饭堂、浴室等地了解归侨的生活情况。归侨们听到廖承志等来慰问的消息，兴奋地集中到广场上来欢迎。七十八岁的棉兰归侨朱南腾，曾经在海外过了几十年卖艺生涯。今天他紧紧拉住廖承志、方方的手说，要把他的医药秘方献给祖国。他还兴奋地为祖国的亲人表演了武术。廖承志还对接待人员的工作作了指示。
    下午，廖承志、方方等，到广州归国华侨学生中等补习学校慰问25日回国的华侨学生。廖承志勉励归侨学生们好好读书，学好本领，以便将来更好地为社会主义祖国工作。
    新华社雅加达26日电　在印度尼西亚的一千六百五十多名流离失所的华侨今天乘中国政府派来的轮船“俄罗斯号”和“亚库契亚号”离雅加达回国。现在总共已有三千八百名流离失所的华侨离开印度尼西亚归国。
    中国大使黄镇、中国大使馆和总领事馆的工作人员以及中华侨团总会的代表冒雨到港口送行。
    乘“俄罗斯号”轮船的华侨在昨晚上船后赶做了大幅标语，挂在船的两边。标语上写着：“感谢你们对我们的帮助”、“让我们在祖国再见”。这些受到迫害的华侨，今天欢欣鼓舞，冒雨在甲板上向岸上的人告别。到处是呼口号声、鼓掌声和歌声。他们一面唱着“全世界人民心一条”和“歌唱祖国”，一面拍着、挥动着手。送行的人热诚地祝他们一路平安，在这两艘船差不多看不见的时候，还在不断招手。
    这些流离失所的华侨是从昨天下午开始上船的。登船和装运行李的工作直到今天清晨才完毕，昨晚下大雨，彻夜未停。可是大使馆和总领事馆的工作人员、中华侨团总会的人员、印度尼西亚的码头工人、船上的船员和工作人员都通夜在雨中工作，帮助华侨搬运行李。
    雅加达华侨学生和家庭妇女组成的保健工作队也在那里从清晨工作到深夜。妇女保健工作人员冒着大雨，用担架把病人抬上船。青年学生也忙于给他们的同胞提供各种服务。
    印度尼西亚的码头工人身上湿透了，他们脱去上衣，继续工作。一位印度尼西亚起重机驾驶工人已经下班，准备回家休息，他在回家途中听说需要他的时候，赶忙回来，冒雨继续工作了十二小时。
    流离失所的华侨对于这样热情和无微不至的关怀照顾都十分感动。
    当船只驶离港口的时候，华侨们高呼“中国和印度尼西亚人民的友谊万岁”，并且欢唱“全世界人民心一条”和“歌唱祖国”这两支歌，这深切地反映了他们的感受和心意。
    新华社雅加达25日电　一批流离失所的华侨今天中午开始登上中国政府派来接运华侨回国的轮船“俄罗斯号”和“亚库契亚号”。
    这些华侨是从西爪哇的加拉横和苏印地方来的。他们中间的老年人和儿童，有雅加达的华侨家庭主妇们组成的保健工作者陪送到船边，船上的工作人员帮助他们登上轮船。
    这些丧失生计的华侨看到船舱内完备的设备和整洁舒适的床位，都极为兴奋、感动。
    中国驻印度尼西亚大使黄镇、参赞柳雨峰和文化参赞司马文森等今天访问了“俄罗斯号”和“亚库契亚号”上的船员和随同这两艘船来的工作人员。
