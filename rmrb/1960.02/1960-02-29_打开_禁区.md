    Opening the "Restricted Zone"
    Yu Shu
    I am a complete layman when it comes to medicine, and I have never been hospitalized in my life. However, a piece of news about medicine in the Sichuan Daily attracted me and kept me reading to the end, and I experienced a wave of irrepressible excitement. The news said that a group of young researchers from Sichuan Medical College, holding high the red flag of putting politics in command, successfully completed the first case of intracardiac direct vision surgery, opening up what has always been called a "restricted zone" of surgery here. A female worker suffering from congenital atrial septal defect, after undergoing surgery using hypothermic circulatory arrest, is in good condition and has now basically recovered her health.
    Under the leadership of the Party, adhering to putting politics in command, vigorously launching mass movements, and promoting the Communist spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, we will surely be invincible; this is a truth fully proven by the countless facts of the two years of continuous great leap forward. Here, I would like to say a few words about opening up "restricted zones."
    In our lives, there are still many "restricted zones" that predecessors have not opened up, or even dared to open up. This is also one of the characteristics of our national economy being "poor and blank." The air route to Tibet used to be called an "air restricted zone." In many fields of science and technology, there are many such "restricted zones." Standing at a distance, one can only see a hazy view, and what exactly is going on there? No one knows. And when will we be able to break in? No one knows either. Thus, year after year, the "restricted zone" becomes more and more mysterious, and the path to opening the "restricted zone" becomes more and more distant.
    In the final analysis, this is nothing more than having a "restricted zone" in one's mind first; not daring to think, not daring to experiment, not daring to create. The Party's General Line first opened up the "restricted zone" in the minds of 600 million people, breaking superstitions and liberating minds. As a result, the power of 600 million people, like an atomic explosion, emitted an incomparably strong impact force. Surging and unstoppable, in two years, the country has undergone great changes. Thus, good news came like snowflakes, one peak after another was crossed, one miracle after another appeared, and one "restricted zone" after another was opened. The opening of these "restricted zones," in turn, completely destroyed the old things that bound thinking. The Sichuan Medical College opened up the "restricted zone" of surgery, which bankrupted the mysticism that "medical science is very mysterious," the conditionalism that "conditions are not sufficient to conduct research," the ageism that "young people cannot engage in cutting-edge science," and other bourgeois medical thoughts of all kinds.
    To climb peaks and open "restricted zones," one needs the courage to overcome all difficulties and the perseverance to persist; but more importantly, one needs to put politics in command, needs the Communist spirit, and needs a red heart of loyalty to the revolutionary cause. The comrades of Sichuan Medical College have set a new example for us. Let us make persistent efforts and march towards new scientific fortresses and new "restricted zones"!

### 打开“禁区”

    打开“禁区”
    俞蜀
    我对医学是完全外行的，有生以来，也还没有住过医院。但是，四川日报上一条有关医学的新闻，却吸引住我，一直看到底，并且有一阵难以遏止的激动。那消息说：四川医学院的一群青年研究人员，高举着政治挂帅的红旗，成功地完成了第一例心脏内直视手术，打开了在这里素来被称为外科学的“禁区”。一个患先天性心房间隔缺损的女工，经过采用低温断流方法施行手术后，情况良好，现在已经基本上恢复健康了。
    在党的领导下，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的共产共义风格，就一定无往而不胜，这是被两年持续跃进中的无数事实所充分证明了的真理。我在这里，想说几句关于打开“禁区”的感想。
    在我们的生活里，还有许多“禁区”，是前人所没有打开甚至根本就不敢去打开的。这也是我们国民经济“一穷二白”的特点之一。通往西藏的飞机航线，曾被人称为“空中禁区”。在科学技术的许多领域里，这样的“禁区”多得很。站在远处看，只见蒙胧一片，究竟那里有些什么名堂？不知道。究竟什么时候才能打进去？也不知道。于是，年复一年，
  “禁区”越来越神秘，打开“禁区”的途径，越来越遥远。
    归根结蒂，这无非是由于思想里先有个“禁区”；不敢去想，不敢去试验，不敢去创造。党的总路线首先打开了六亿人民思想里的“禁区”，破除迷信，解放思想，于是，六亿人民的力量，便像原子核大爆炸那样，发出了坚强无比的冲击力量。汹涌澎湃，势如破竹，两年之间，江山大变。于是，捷报便如同雪片飞来，一个又一个高峰跨过了，一个又一个奇迹出现了，一个又一个“禁区”打开了。这些“禁区”的打开，反过来又彻底摧毁了束缚思想的那些旧东西。四川医学院打开了外科学的“禁区”，就使得那些认为“医学科学很神秘”的神秘论，“条件不够，不能进行研究”的条件论，“年青人不能搞尖端科学”的年龄论，以及其他形形色色的资产阶级医学思想，一齐破产。
    攀登高峰，打开“禁区”，需要排除万难的勇气，需要持久不懈的毅力；而更重要的，是需要政治挂帅，需要共产主义风格，需要对革命事业的赤胆忠心。四川医学院的同志们，为我们树立了新的榜样，让我们再接再厉，向新的科学堡垒、新的“禁区”进军！
