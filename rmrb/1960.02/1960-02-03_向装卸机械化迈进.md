    Moving Towards Mechanization of Loading and Unloading
    In order to realize the continued leap forward of the national economy this year, the transportation sector bears a heavy task. The key to completing this task lies in accelerating the turnaround rate of vehicles and ships. And the key to accelerating the turnaround rate of vehicles and ships lies in further improving loading and unloading work. According to statistics, the time railway freight cars spend in stations, factories, mines, and ports accounts for 55% of the total turnaround time of the vehicles; loading and unloading time for road transport accounts for more than 30% of the total transport time; and the time ships spend in port accounts for 50% to 70% of the total operating time. This situation greatly affects the turnaround of vehicles and ships. The main reason for the problem that vehicles and ships "run in the middle but sit idle at both ends" is that loading and unloading operations, whether by rail, road, or port, still rely mainly on manual labor. This not only occupies a large amount of labor but also prevents loading and unloading efficiency from being rapidly and significantly improved. Therefore, improving loading and unloading efficiency is of great significance to unleashing transportation potential. It is estimated that if the time railway vehicles spend in stations, factories, mines, and ports is universally reduced by two hours per day, it would be equivalent to increasing the transportation capacity by more than 7,000 vehicles per day. If the time ships spend in port is shortened, and the navigation rate of the country's existing wooden sailboats and tugboats is increased by 5%, the increased transportation capacity would be equivalent to the total transportation capacity of new tugboats and wooden sailboats built in 1959.
    In addition to strengthening the political and ideological education and technical training of loading and unloading workers, and improving the labor organization of loading and unloading work, the most important way to improve loading and unloading efficiency is to carry out technical reforms and technical revolutions.
    The ultimate goal of the technical revolution in loading and unloading operations is to replace the manual carrying, picking, shouldering, and lifting that has been inherited for thousands of years with modern loading and unloading tools and equipment. Of course, such a goal cannot be universally achieved immediately. However, it is possible in the short term to basically realize mechanization in large stations and ports, basic semi-mechanization in medium-sized stations and ports, and basic indigenous mechanization in small stations and ports. From a national perspective, thanks to the completion of the main targets of the First Five-Year Plan and the Second Five-Year Plan, we are now able to use more resources to strengthen certain weak links in the national economy. Strengthening the construction of transportation is an important task in developing the national economy in 1960. In the construction of transportation, the construction of loading and unloading tools and equipment occupies a particularly important position. From the perspective of the loading and unloading sector, the continued Great Leap Forward in the past two years has increased a considerable number of loading and unloading machines, and advanced units that have basically realized mechanization, semi-mechanization, and indigenous mechanization have emerged in large, medium, and small ports and stations respectively. With a much better material and technical foundation than a few years ago, and with advanced role models available for learning, especially since we have found the path of technical innovation that combines indigenous and foreign methods, and progresses from indigenous to foreign, the conditions for realizing mechanization of loading and unloading are much more favorable than in the past.
    How can we strive to realize mechanization of loading and unloading in the shortest possible period? The most important thing is to implement the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, combining large, medium, and small, using foreign methods when possible, using partial foreign methods when possible, using indigenous methods when foreign methods are not possible, and continuously improving and progressing from indigenous to foreign. There are two ways to transition from manual loading and unloading of goods to mechanical operation: one is to add modern loading and unloading machinery. This type of machinery has the advantages of high efficiency, low labor usage, durability, flexibility, and lightness. This year, China's machinery manufacturing industry can devote more resources than last year to manufacturing loading and unloading machinery to support the technical transformation of transportation. However, at present, China's machinery production capacity cannot meet the needs of all aspects, and it is impossible to equip thousands of medium and small ports and stations with modern machinery. Therefore, we must also use another method, which is to rely on the broad masses of workers, start from the current possible conditions, vigorously carry out technical innovation, and create and reform loading and unloading tools according to local conditions and the nature of the goods. This is the most practical and effective method. The experience since the Great Leap Forward has proven that manufacturing loading and unloading machinery with indigenous methods is technically simple, inexpensive, easy to do and learn, and can produce immediate results. In particular, it is a faster, better, and more economical way for medium and small stations and ports to simplify equipment, rely on their own efforts, and strive to realize indigenous mechanization or semi-mechanization combining indigenous and foreign methods. Some comrades believe that "indigenous methods cannot solve major problems." This view is one-sided. It is true that modern loading and unloading tools have higher efficiency and better quality. However, some indigenous methods can also achieve high efficiency and high quality. For example, the high platforms and low cargo positions that have been widely promoted by the railway sector, and adopted by various regions, have increased loading and unloading efficiency by several times to dozens of times. Of course, many indigenous methods are less efficient than modern machinery, but they are not low at all compared to manual carrying. If local conditions are better, semi-mechanization can also be achieved by combining indigenous and foreign methods, which would further improve efficiency. Relying on the broad masses of workers to create loading and unloading machinery or machinery combining indigenous and foreign methods does not fail to solve the problem; rather, it solves a considerable part of the problem. We should continue to promote the communist spirit of daring to think, speak, and act, which has been fostered since the Great Leap Forward, and carry out mass movements for technical innovation and technical revolution more widely in stations and ports, create and manufacture more and better loading and unloading tools and equipment, and greatly improve loading and unloading efficiency.
    At present, there are two issues that deserve special attention in the technical transformation of loading and unloading tools. One is the application, consolidation, and improvement of indigenous machinery. The indigenous loading and unloading machinery that has been established should be further improved and enhanced with the spirit of continuous revolution. It is not surprising that loading and unloading machinery made with indigenous methods has some shortcomings. Our task is to continuously improve it. We should strengthen leadership, continue to mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, do a good job in the selection and finalization of various loading and unloading machinery, gradually improve quality, transform clumsiness into dexterity, and transform low transport efficiency into high transport efficiency. After new tools are made, we must insist on promoting their use. Although loading and unloading workers are eager to improve working conditions and reduce labor intensity after years of heavy physical labor, many of them are accustomed to simple operating methods, and are not used to using new tools at first, and sometimes the efficiency may not be very high. Therefore, in addition to continuously improving the quality and efficiency of new tools, we must also strengthen the ideological education of loading and unloading workers, improve their technical level, and help them shorten the process from unfamiliarity to familiarity, from being unaccustomed to being accustomed, and then gradually transition from indigenous mechanization to semi-mechanization and mechanization.
    Another issue is that large stations and ports have relatively more modern loading and unloading machinery, but the utilization rate of these machines is currently very low because many loading and unloading machines are not serialized. Loading and unloading work is a continuous process of linked operations. One type of machine usually only applies to one process. If a single machine is used separately, the efficiency of this process will be increased several times. However, since the previous process is still manual operation, it cannot supply the machine's lifting capacity, or the next process cannot keep up, and the goods are stagnated here. This situation where the preceding and following processes cannot be connected and adapted seriously affects the full play of mechanical efficiency. Only by organizing the use of various machines according to the operation process, connecting each link, and realizing the serialization of technical reforms can the efficiency of loading and unloading machinery be fully utilized. Since we want to engage in serialization, does that mean we can only wait for the state to supplement new mechanical equipment? This view is also incorrect. The correct approach is to rely on the masses and be self-reliant. Moreover, many large stations and large ports have certain repair and manufacturing capabilities and can manufacture indigenous and foreign machinery to supplement the deficiencies of existing loading and unloading machinery. For example, the workers of Qingdao Port have trial-produced and improved more than 1,800 indigenous and foreign machines in the past year. Last year, they jointly used various machines to form several serialized loading and unloading lines, and the loading and unloading time was reduced by one-third compared to the original regulations. This shows that large stations and ports must also walk on two legs when moving towards mechanization of loading and unloading.
    As long as we forge ahead along the path of technical innovation of "combining indigenous and foreign methods, and progressing from indigenous to foreign", and engage in mechanization when possible, and engage in indigenous mechanization and semi-mechanization first when mechanization cannot be realized temporarily, then our loading and unloading efficiency will definitely be improved quickly, and the turnaround speed of vehicles and ships will be greatly accelerated. The glorious and arduous task of supporting the continued leap forward of industrial and agricultural production borne by transportation will also be better completed. For millions of loading and unloading workers, gradually and rapidly realizing mechanization of loading and unloading will enable them to get rid of the "thousand-year carrying pole and ten-thousand-year basket" situation as soon as possible and enter a new world where "loading and unloading machines are on the horse, and carrying poles are thrown away with smiles."

    向装卸机械化迈进
    为了实现今年国民经济的继续跃进，交通运输部门负担着繁重的任务。要完成这个任务，关键在于加速车船的周转率。而加速车船周转率的关键又在于进一步改进装卸工作。据统计，目前铁路货车在车站、厂矿、港口的停留时间，占车辆总周转时间的55％；公路运输装卸时间占整个运输时间的30％以上；船舶在港口停泊时间占全部营运时间的50％至70％。这种情况大大影响了车船的周转，车船“跑在中间，窝在两头”这一症结出现的主要原因是：目前不论铁路、公路和港口，装卸作业主要还是依靠手工劳动。这不仅占用了大量的劳动力，也使装卸效率不能很快地大幅度地提高。由此可见，提高装卸效率，对发挥运输潜力有很大的意义。据计算，如果全国铁路的车辆在车站、厂矿、港口的停留时间每天普遍缩短两小时，就等于每天增加七千多辆车的运输能力；如果缩短船舶在港口的停留时间，把全国现有的木帆船和轮驳船的航行率提高5％，其增加的运输力就等于我们1959年新建轮驳船和木帆船的运输力总和。
    提高装卸效率的途径，除了加强对装卸工人的政治思想教育和技术教育、改进装卸工作的劳动组织等措施外，最重要的是进行技术改革和技术革命。
    装卸作业的技术革命最终目标是用现代化的装卸工具和设备，代替数千年来遗留下的人工背、挑、扛、抬。当然，这样一个目标，不是马上就可以普遍实现的。但是，在大型的车站和港口基本实现机械化，中型的车站和港口基本实现半机械化，小型的车站和港口基本实现土机械化，则是短期内可能作到的。从全国来说，由于第一个五年计划和第二个五年计划主要指标的完成，我们已经有可能用较多的力量来加强国民经济中的某些薄弱环节。加强交通运输的建设，是1960年发展国民经济的一项重要任务。在交通运输的建设中，装卸工具和装卸设备的建设占有特别重要的地位。从装卸部门来看，两年来的继续大跃进，增加了相当多的装卸机械，在大、中、小三类港、站中已经分别出现了基本上实现机械化、半机械化、土机械化的先进单位。有了比较几年以前好得多的物质技术基础，又有了可供学习的先进榜样，特别是我们找到了土洋并举、由土到洋的技术革新的道路，实现装卸机械化的条件比过去有利得多了。
    怎样才能争取在尽可能短的时期里实现装卸机械化呢？最重要的是必须贯彻土洋并举，大中小结合，能洋则洋，能部分洋则部分洋，不能洋则土，不断提高，由土到洋的方针。货物装卸由手工操作到机械操作，有两个办法：一是添置现代化的装卸机械。这种机械具有效率高，用劳动力少，坚固耐用，灵活轻巧等优点。今年，我国的机械制造业可以拿出比去年较多的力量制造装卸机械，支援交通运输的技术改造。但是，当前我国的机械生产能力还不可能满足各方面的需要，要把数以千计的中小港站统统都用现代化机械装备起来是不可能的。所以，还必须用另外一种办法，那就是依靠广大职工，从当前可能的条件出发，大搞技术革新，因地制宜、因物制器地创造和改革装卸工具，这是一个最实际也是最有效的办法。大跃进以来的经验证明，用土办法制造装卸机械，技术简单，花钱不多，易做易学，可以“立竿见影”。特别是中、小车站和港口，因陋就简，自力更生，努力实现装卸土机械化或土洋结合的半机械化，这是一条多快好省的道路。有一些同志认为“土办法解决不了大问题”。这种看法是片面的。现代化的装卸工具效率比较高、质量比较好，这是事实。但是，某些土办法也可以作到高效率、高质量。比如铁路部门普遍推广的高站台、低货位，各地采用这种办法，装卸效率提高了几倍到几十倍。当然，许多土办法比起现代化的机械效率是比较低的，但是比起肩挑人抬，则不是很低而是很高了。如果当地条件较好，还可以采取土洋结合的办法实现半机械化，那样效率就提高得更多。依靠广大职工大造装卸土机械或土洋结合的机械，不是不解决问题，而是相当解决问题。我们应该继续发扬大跃进以来敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，更加广泛地在车站、港口开展技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，创造和制造更多更好的装卸工具和设备，把装卸效率大大提高一步。
    当前，在装卸工具的技术改造中，有两个问题是值得特别注意的。一个是土机械的应用、巩固和提高的问题。已经建立起来的土装卸机械，应当用不断革命的精神将其进一步改进和提高。用土办法造出的装卸机械有一些缺点，是不足为奇的。我们的任务是不断地加以改进。应当加强领导，继续发动群众，依靠群众，做好各种装卸机械的选型、定型工作，逐步提高质量，变笨重为灵巧，变运效低为运效高。新工具制成后，要坚持推广使用。装卸工人虽然在长年繁重的体力劳动中，迫切要求改善劳动条件，减轻劳动强度，但其中有不少人习惯于简单的操作方法，开始使用新工具不习惯，有时效率也可能不很高。因此，我们除了不断地改进、提高新工具的质量和效能外，还要加强对装卸工人的思想教育，提高工人的技术水平，帮助工人缩短由生疏到熟练、由不习惯到习惯的过程，然后再在土机械化的基础上，逐步向半机械化、机械化过渡。
    再一个问题是，大型的车站和港口，拥有比较多的现代化装卸机械，目前这些机械的利用率还很低，原因是许多装卸机械没有系列化。装卸工作是一环扣一环的连续作业过程。一种机械通常只能适用于一道工序，如果单独地使用一架机械，这一工序效率提高好几倍，但是，由于上一道工序还是手工操作，供不上机械的吊运，或者下一道工序跟不上，货物又在这里停滞下来。这种前后工序不能衔接和适应的情况，严重地影响了机械效率的充分发挥。只有把各种机械按照作业过程组织起来使用，使各个环节互相衔接起来，实现技术改革的系列化，装卸机械的效能才能充分发挥。既然要搞系列化，那末是不是就只有等待国家补充新的机械设备呢？这种看法也是不对的。正确的作法是依靠群众，自力更生。何况许多大车站、大港口都有一定的修造能力，能够自己制造土的和洋的机械来补充已有装卸机械之不足。如青岛港职工最近一年来，试制和改进了各种土的和洋的机械一千八百多件，去年联合使用多种机械，组成几条系列化装卸线，装卸时间比原规定缩短了三分之一。由此可见，大型车站和港口在向装卸机械化迈进的时候，也必须要两条腿走路。
    只要我们沿着“土洋并举，由土到洋”这条技术革新的道路奋勇前进，能搞机械化就搞机械化，暂时不能实现机械化，就先搞土机械化、半机械化，那么，我们的装卸效率就一定能很快地提高，车船的周转速度也必将大大加快，交通运输担负的支援工农业生产继续跃进的光荣而艰巨的任务也一定会更好地完成。对于千百万的装卸工人来说，逐步而又迅速地实现装卸机械化，就会使他们早日摆脱“千年扁担万年箩”的状况，进入到“装卸机械上了马，丢掉扁担笑呵呵”的新天地。
