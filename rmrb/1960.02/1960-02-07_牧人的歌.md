The Shepherd's Song
	In the past, when An Feng herded for the landlord, the barren mountains were like a hot oil pan, his feet were locked in chains, and his eyes were blinded by tears. How could he have the heart to sing?! Now that he herds for the commune, the sun warms his heart, the spring breeze carries the fragrance of rice, he drives the cattle and sheep all over the mountains, and sings a mountain song.

    牧人的歌
    安枫过去为东家放牧，荒山就像热油锅，脚被锁链锁着，眼被泪水蒙着，哪里有心唱歌？！如今为公社放牧，太阳温暖着心窝，春风吹来稻香，赶着满山牛羊，唱着一片山歌。
