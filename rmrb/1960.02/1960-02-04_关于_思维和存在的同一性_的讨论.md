    Discussion on "The Identity of Thinking and Being"

    The question of whether there is an identity between thinking and being has sparked debate in the recent two issues of the monthly journal "Philosophical Research."

    The twelfth issue of "Philosophical Research" last year reprinted an article by Shi Cheng entitled "'The Identity of Thinking and Being' is it a Principle of Materialism?" published in the Guangming Daily on October 11th of the same year. This article raised objections to the arguments in Guo Yuezhen's article published in the first issue of "Philosophical Research" in 1958. The first issue of "Philosophical Research" in 1960 then published Wang Ruoshui's article, "Is There No Identity Between Thinking and Being?" refuting Shi Cheng's point of view.

    Guo Yuezhen argued in his article that "Engels's conclusion that the second aspect of the fundamental question of philosophy is the question of the identity of thinking and being is concise and accurate." He said that the identity of thinking and being can be understood materialistically or idealistically. Dialectical materialism acknowledges the identity of thinking and being, primarily in the sense that thinking can form a correct reflection of being, theory can achieve conformity with reality, and the subjective can achieve consistency with the objective. The "identity" mentioned by Marxism is the same as "unity" and "consistency." The problem of the identity of thinking and being is the second aspect of the fundamental question of philosophy because it addresses the question of whether thinking can know being, a question no philosopher can avoid. He said that Engels stated that the vast majority of philosophers have affirmatively resolved this issue, including both materialists and thoroughgoing idealists. As for the fundamental opposition between materialism and idealism on this issue, it does not lie in whether or not to acknowledge the identity of thinking and being, but in the fact that dialectical materialism believes that thinking can conform to and be consistent with being, while idealism equates the identity of thinking and being with equivalence.

    Shi Cheng believes that "the identity of thinking and being" is merely a principle of idealism, fundamentally opposed to the materialist epistemology—the theory of reflection—and therefore not at all the second aspect of the fundamental question of philosophy. He cited passages from Lenin's "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism," Engels's "Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy," and other classic works, asserting that the classic Marxist writers fundamentally denied the identity of thinking and being and resolutely opposed this idealist theory. Therefore, he considers this a distortion of the classic works by Guo Yuezhen. At the same time, he believes that using the identity of contradictions to argue for the "identity of thinking and being" is also incorrect. He said that if it is said that "thinking and being are opposites, and these two aspects of thinking and being, under certain conditions, are conditions for each other's existence, coexisting in a unity," then it would be impossible to draw a clear line between this and the idealist "principle of co-ordination." He said that the marker distinguishing materialism, idealism, and agnosticism is the materialist theory of reflection, not the "identity of thinking and being."

    Wang Ruoshui believes that the identity understood by dialectics is concrete identity, that is, identity that includes difference and opposition, and in the classic works, the meanings of "identity" and "unity" are the same. He said that Shi Cheng's denial of viewing the relationship between thinking and being as a unity of opposites is a fundamental divergence in principles. It is precisely because subjective thinking and the objective world both obey the same laws that the two can conform and be consistent. Through practice, subjective things and objective things can, under certain conditions, mutually transition and transform. All of this indicates that thinking and being have identity. Hegel acknowledged the unity of thinking and being, but he attributed the basis of this unity to thinking, reversing the relationship between thinking and being. Dialectical materialism turns Hegel's upside-down worldview right-side up, believing that the basis of the unity of thinking and being is being. As for the "principle of co-ordination" of the empirio-criticist Avenarius, it has nothing in common with the identity of thinking and being as understood by dialectical materialism. Wang Ruoshui believes that it is correct to say that Engels regarded the "identity of thinking and being" as the second aspect of the fundamental question of philosophy and as a marker distinguishing between gnosticism and agnosticism. He believes that denying any identity between thinking and being means not admitting that thinking and being are two contradictory aspects, or two aspects without a unified relationship. That is to say, the fundamental principle of dialectics, the unity of opposites, does not apply to such a fundamental question as thinking and being, which is actually using a metaphysical viewpoint to deny dialectics.

### 关于“思维和存在的同一性”的讨论

    关于“思维和存在的同一性”的讨论
    关于思维和存在之间有没有同一性的问题，在最近两期的“哲学研究”月刊上引起了争论。
    去年“哲学研究”第十二期转载了同年10月11日光明日报发表的世诚写的“‘思维和存在的同一性’是唯物主义的原理吗？”一文。这篇文章对“哲学研究”1958年第一期所载郭月争的文章中的论点，提出了反对的意见。“哲学研究”1960年第一期又发表了王若水的“思维和存在没有同一性吗？”一文，反驳世诚的观点。
    郭月争在他的文章中认为，“恩格斯把哲学基本问题的第二个方面归结为思维和存在的同一性问题是简洁而准确的”。他说，思维和存在的同一性，可以作唯物主义的了解，也可以作唯心主义的了解。辩证唯物主义承认思维和存在的同一性，首先是指的思维能够构成存在的正确反映，理论能够达到对现实的符合，主观能达到和客观的一致。马克思主义所说的“同一”，也就是“统一”、“一致”的意思。思维和存在的同一性问题，所以是哲学基本问题的第二个方面，因为它要解决思维能否认识存在这样一个问题，没有一个哲学家能够回避这个问题。他说，恩格斯说，绝大多数哲学家都肯定地解决了这个问题，这里是既包括唯物主义者，也包括彻底的唯心主义者的。至于唯物主义和唯心主义在这个问题上的根本对立，并不在于承认不承认思维和存在的同一性，而在于辩证唯物主义认为思维能与存在相符合、相一致，而唯心主义则把思维和存在的同一性说成是等同。
    世诚认为，“思维和存在的同一性”，仅仅是唯心主义的原理，是和唯物主义的认识论——反映论根本对立的，因此根本不是什么哲学基本问题的第二个方面。他引用了列宁的“唯物主义和经验批判主义”、恩格斯的“费尔巴哈和德国古典哲学的终结”以及其他一些经典著作中的一些话后认定，马克思主义经典作家根本否认思维和存在的同一性，而且坚决地反对过这种唯心主义理论。因此，他认为这是郭月争对经典著作的一种歪曲。同时他认为，根据矛盾的同一性来论证“思维和存在的同一性”，也是错误的。他说，如果说“思维和存在是对立面，思维和存在这两个方面，在一定的条件下，互为存在的条件，共处于一个统一体中”，那就不能和唯心主义的“原则同格论”划清界线了。他说，划分唯物主义、唯心主义与不可知论的界线的标志是唯物主义的反映论，而不是“思维和存在的同一性”。
    王若水认为，辩证法所了解的同一性是具体的同一性，即包括差别和对立的同一性，在经典著作里，“同一性”和“统一性”的意思是一样的。他说，世诚否认把思维和存在的关系看成是对立面的统一，这是根本原则的分歧。正因为主观的思维和客观的世界都服从于同一的规律，所以两者能够符合、一致。通过实践，主观的东西和客观的东西是可以在一定条件下互相过渡，互相转化。这都表明思维和存在有同一性。黑格尔承认思维和存在的统一，但是他把这个统一的基础归之于思维，把思维和存在的关系弄颠倒了。辩证唯物主义把黑格尔的颠倒的世界观顺过来，认为思维和存在的统一的基础是存在。至于经验批判主义者阿芬那留斯的“原则同格论”，这和辩证唯物主义所理解的思维和存在的同一性，毫无共同之处。王若水认为说恩格斯把“思维和存在的同一性”作为哲学基本问题的第二个方面，作为划分可知论和不可知论的标志，是对的。他认为，否认思维和存在的任何同一性，就意味着不承认思维和存在是矛盾的两个方面，或没有统一关系的两个方面。也就是说，对立统一这条辩证法的根本原则，竟不适用于思维和存在这样一个根本性的问题，这实际上是用形而上学的观点来否认辩证法。
