Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 20th: The Soviet Journalists' Association has issued a call to journalists around the world, urging them to stand at the forefront of the fight against the "Cold" War and "hot" war.

The Soviet Journalists' Association said that we journalists deeply understand how intolerable warmongering is to the people, and how heavily the burden of armaments weighs on their shoulders. We can make greater efforts to melt the ice of the "Cold" War as soon as possible and prevent a new world war from breaking out.

The appeal also pointed out the positive significance of the Soviet government's proposal for a plan for complete and thorough disarmament.

The Soviet Journalists' Association calls on journalists around the world to dedicate all journalistic skills, energy, and talent to the cause of defending peace and consolidating friendship among peoples of all countries.
