(Report from Chengdu, February 5th) Following the nationwide planting of "Rapeseed King," the people of Sichuan Province, both urban and rural, are advancing victoriously, extensively planting various "Crop Kings." They are using these "Kings" as models to improve cultivation techniques, promote the reform of farming systems, and increase total crop output, in order to achieve high-speed development in agricultural production.

Currently, a fervent upsurge of planting various "Crop Kings" is forming throughout the vast Sichuan Basin. Everywhere, there are scenes of simultaneous planning and action, with thousands of households participating. The Luzhou Prefecture plans for each person to plant five "Cotton King" plants, five "Rapeseed King" plants, ten to twenty "Pumpkin King" plants, and other "Kings." The sowing and seedling cultivation of early-maturing crop "Kings" is mostly completed. In Neijiang Prefecture, some of the planted cotton, sweet potato, sugarcane, peanut, and other "Kings" have already sprouted. Jianyang County, a cotton-producing area, recently rushed to build more than 1,000 greenhouses and hotbeds, cultivating 4 million "Cotton King" seedlings. In the mountainous Langzhong County in northern Sichuan, 2.7 million "Pumpkin King" pits were dug in a concentrated effort of ten days.

The nationwide planting of various "Crop Kings" was launched after the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a call to the people of the province not long ago. Since the Great Leap Forward, with the continuous liberation of thought and technological innovation of the vast number of cadres and masses, a large number of single plants with high yields, known as "Kings," have emerged in various parts of the province. These "Kings" have been carefully cultivated, and their yields are dozens or even hundreds of times higher than those of ordinary field crops. For example, last year, a "Rapeseed King" in Zhong County yielded as much as 12.5 jin per plant; a "Cotton King" in Jianyang County bore more than 1,400 cotton bolls; and a "Sweet Potato King" in Weiyuan County produced 213 jin of sweet potatoes. The emergence of these "Kings" has attracted the attention of leaders in some areas, who have begun to study and improve cultivation techniques through the "Kings" and plant them on a large scale. Last year, Zhong County, Shehong, and many other places further launched a nationwide campaign to plant "Rapeseed King" and "Cotton King," thus promoting the "King" planting movement to a new stage. Based on the experience of Zhong County and other places, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided this year to make the nationwide planting of various "Crop Kings" an important measure to improve leadership methods and achieve high yield and more yield. This movement has rapidly spread throughout the province.

The situation in the past two years shows that grasping "Kings" is a deeper and more detailed application of the typical leadership method in agricultural production. Through "Kings," it is possible to understand the characteristics of crops more meticulously and quickly than with other methods, discover the potential for increased crop production and high-yield conditions, and thus master the laws of high crop yield. By establishing models and promoting high-yield experiences through "Kings," it is possible to improve large-scale cultivation techniques and increase yields more quickly and effectively. Take Zhong County as an example. Two years ago, rapeseed cultivation techniques in the county were relatively crude, and the general yield per mu was only a few dozen jin. In 1957, several high-yield "Rapeseed Kings" appeared in Zhong County, and the county committee attached great importance to this, immediately grasping these "Rapeseed Kings" for careful study. The study found that the common characteristics of the growth of these "Rapeseed Kings" were thick soil layers, sufficient base fertilizer, early sowing, and diligent weeding, as well as the application of hot fertilizer during winter. On this basis, the county committee summarized a series of advanced measures, such as deep plowing, timely early sowing, soil cultivation on ridges, and application of warming topdressing, for use in rapeseed cultivation throughout the county in 1958. Last year, the county committee further improved the close-planting specifications based on the sufficient sunlight and good ventilation of the "Rapeseed King." With the improvement of technology, the county's rapeseed yield rapidly increased, with an average yield of more than 200 jin per mu for two consecutive years, becoming a high-yield red banner for rapeseed production.

The nationwide planting of "Kings" is also a new development in launching mass movements in agricultural production. First of all, the emergence of "Kings" has further liberated the minds of the masses. In the past, many so-called low-yield crops, such as rapeseed, wheat, cotton, and beans, have been proven by the "Kings" to be not necessarily low-yielding. The key is to increase the understanding of these crops and give them appropriate measures. Many high-yield crops, such as rice, potatoes, and corn, still have great potential to be tapped. Secondly, since various "Kings" are mostly planted sporadically, with each person planting only a small amount, it is possible to make full use of the workers' spare time or labor gaps in urban and rural areas to carry out planting and management, greatly mobilizing and giving play to the enthusiasm of urban and rural people to develop agricultural production, and directly invest the power of the whole people in developing agricultural production to varying degrees. Facts show that as long as leadership is strengthened and methods such as technical training, regular exchange of experience, and mobile guidance are adopted, the technical problems of planting "Kings" are not difficult to solve. Some crops with weak technology can be planted by everyone, and some crops with higher technical requirements can be cultivated on a large scale by the rural population. There are great benefits to expanding and improving the technical strength of the masses through planting "Kings."

The nationwide planting of "Kings" is also an important measure to implement the combination of multiple planting for more yield and high yield for more yield at the current stage. Because the planting of "Kings" mainly uses scattered open spaces such as field edges, front and back of houses, thereby fully utilizing the land, expanding the planting area, and increasing the total crop output. Last year, Zhong County planted 900,000 "Rapeseed King" plants, with an average yield of more than 4 liang of rapeseed per plant, for a total of more than 230,000 jin of rapeseed, accounting for more than 10% of the increased part of the county's total rapeseed yield last year. Shehong County mobilized the rural population to plant more than 5.8 million "Cotton King" plants, with an average of 50 to 80 cotton bolls per plant, for a total of more than 1.5 million jin of ginned cotton, accounting for 20% of the increased part of the county's total cotton output last year, making the county's total cotton output increase by 69% compared with the previous year.

The emergence of various "Kings" has greatly opened the eyes of the vast number of cadres and masses in Sichuan. This year, a galloping situation has emerged in the province's agricultural production from the very beginning. The people's communes in vast areas have used new yield standards combined with current actual conditions to formulate and revise the targets and measures for continued leap forward this year, and have launched a vigorous socialist production competition. According to the various "Kings" and the experience of large-scale high yields in the past two years, the people of the province have grasped early, grasped tightly, and grasped well the production of minor spring crops and the preparation for spring plowing, striving for continued leap forward in agricultural production this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, February 5th. Spurred on by the inspiring slogan of "Half a Year's Grain from Minor Spring Crops," Sichuan is doing everything possible to increase the yield of summer grain and vegetables.

The sowing time of minor spring grain crops in Sichuan Province this year has been moved forward by one solar term, the planting area has been expanded by 25%, and all idle land has been used to increase the planting of summer harvested crops. Field management has also been grasped earlier, tighter, and more meticulously than in previous years.

The experience of Sichuan Province in the past few years, especially the Great Leap Forward in the past two years, proves that expanding the planting area of spring potatoes is an important measure to increase the proportion of summer harvested grain and improve land utilization. The growth time of spring potatoes is only 90 to 100 days, and it is a good preceding crop for corn, sorghum, sweet potatoes, and rice. At the same time, it can be rotated, intercropped, and interplanted with many crops. Last year, the average yield per mu in most areas was around 2,000 jin. Now, the mass movement of planting spring potatoes on a large scale has formed a climax throughout the province. Wulong County, which had an average yield of more than 2,880 jin per mu last year, will expand its planting area by more than two times on the basis of 27,000 mu last year. Nanchong County has expanded its spring potato planting area from 44,000 mu to 120,000 mu this year.

The mass movement of planting melons, beans, and spring vegetables has been launched throughout the province. Many communes have mobilized all the people to use open spaces in front of and behind houses to plant pumpkins, striving for each person to harvest at least 100 jin. Xichong County has vigorously developed warm-bed seedling cultivation, advanced the planting time, and has planted 2.15 million pumpkin nests, with a total output of at least more than 20 million jin. Jiangjin Prefecture has fully utilized the experience of vegetable bumper harvests last year, planting spring vegetables on 500,000 mu and melons and beans on 200 million nests, ensuring that each person has at least 1,000 jin of vegetables in spring and summer. In the past few days, Nanchong Prefecture has planted more than 300 vegetable nests per person, and immediately after planting, has universally applied topdressing, and has established a field management system with fixed personnel. The entire prefecture is also preparing seeds for 100 nests of melons and 1,000 nests of beans per household.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, February 5th. Sichuan Province is actively preparing high-quality varieties of major spring crops, planning to vigorously improve the yield per unit area of crops this year, and at the same time, universally adopt methods such as intercropping and interplanting to improve the multiple cropping index and strive for multiple planting and multiple harvests. According to this plan, various short-growing, high-yielding, drought-resistant, and disease-resistant crop varieties have been widely promoted this year. Many places began seed inspection, turning, drying, fine selection, and replacement as early as the end of last year. So far, more than 20 types and 30 million jin of early rice, early corn, and other seeds have been mutually adjusted in various places.

    广树标兵推动大面积丰产  多种多收和高产多收相结合
    四川全民大种各种作物“王”
    油菜、棉花、红苕、甘蔗、花生等“王”遍布千里盆地
    扩大种植春洋芋和春菜的群众运动已形成高潮
    本报成都5日电　四川省城乡人民继全民种“油菜王”以后，乘胜前进，大种各种作物“王”，以“王”为典型，提高栽培技术，推动改革耕作制度并增加作物总产量，实现高速度发展农业生产。
    目前，千里盆地上一个热火朝天大种各种作物“王”的高潮已经形成。到处出现了边规划、边行动，千家万户齐动手的景象。泸州专区计划每人种五株“棉花王”、五株“油菜王”、十到二十株“南瓜王”和其他“王”，早熟作物的“王”大都播种育苗结束。内江专区各地种植的棉花、红苕、甘蔗、花生等“王”有些已发芽出土。产棉区的简阳县最近就赶修了一千多个温室和温床，育下“棉花王”苗达四百万株。川北山区的阆中县突击十天就挖好了“南瓜王”窝二百七十多万个。
    全民大种各种作物“王”是在中共四川省委不久前向全省人民发出号召后展开的。大跃进以来，随着广大干部、群众思想不断解放，技术不断革新，全省各地先后涌现出大量单株高产的被称为“王”的作物。这些“王”都是经过精心的培育，产量比一般田作物单株株产高几十倍甚至成百倍。如去年忠县的一株“油菜王”株产高达十二斤半；简阳县的一株“棉花王”结桃达一千四百多个；威远县一株“红苕王”产苕二百一十三斤。这些“王”的出现，引起了一些地区领导的重视，开始通过“王”研究提高栽培技术，并大量种植。去年，忠县、射洪等不少地方更进一步开展了全民种“油菜王”、“棉花王”的活动，从而把种“王”运动推进到一个新的阶段。根据忠县和其他一些地方的经验，中共四川省委决定今年把全民种植各种作物“王”作为提高领导方法和实现高产、多收的重要措施，这一运动便迅速发展到全省。
    两年来的情况表明，抓“王”就是抓典型的领导方法在农业生产中更深入、更细致的运用。通过“王”能够较其他方法更细致、更迅速地了解作物的特性，发现作物增产潜力和高产条件，从而掌握作物高产规律；通过以“王”树立标兵推广高产经验，能更快、更好地提高大面积栽培技术，增加产量。以忠县为例，这个县两年以前油菜栽培技术还比较粗糙，一般亩产只有几十斤。1957年，忠县出现了几株高产的“油菜王”，县委对此十分重视，当即紧紧抓住这些油菜“王”进行了仔细的研究。研究中发现这几株“油菜王”的成长的共同特点是土层厚、底肥足、播种早、锄草勤，同时在过冬时追施了热性肥。在这一基础上，县委总结出了深耕、适时早播、培土上厢、施保温追肥等一系列先进措施用于1958年全县油菜栽培中。去年，县委又根据“油菜王”日照足、通风好的情况进一步改进了密植规格。随着技术的提高，全县油菜产量迅速提高，连续两年平均亩产超过二百斤以上，成为油菜生产的高产红旗。
    全民种“王”也是在农业生产中大搞群众运动的新发展。首先，由于“王”的出现，更进一步地解放了群众思想。过去许多所谓低产作物，如油菜、小麦、棉花、豆类等，“王”用事实证明并非如此，关键在于增加对这些作物的了解，给予适当的措施。许多高产作物，如水稻、薯类、玉米等也仍大有潜力可挖。其次，由于各种“王”大都是零星种植，每人分种不多，可以充分利用城乡人民工余或劳动空隙进行种植和管理，大大动员和发挥城乡人民发展农业生产的积极性，把全民力量不同程度地直接投入发展农业生产。事实说明，只要加强领导，采取技术传授、定期交流经验及巡回指导等方式，种“王”的技术问题不难解决。一些技术不强的作物人人可种，一些技术要求较高的作物在农村人口中完全能够大搞。通过种“王”对扩大和提高群众技术力量有很大好处。
    全民种“王”也是在目前阶段贯彻多种多收和高产多收相结合的一个重要措施。由于种“王”主要是利用田边地角、房前屋后等零星空地，从而充分利用了土地，扩大了种植面积，增加了作物总产量。去年忠县全县种植了九十万株“油菜王”，每株平均产菜子四两多，共收菜子二十三万多斤，占全县去年油菜子总产量增产部分的10％以上。射洪县发动农村人口种植“棉花王”五百八十多万株，平均每株结桃五十到八十个，共产皮棉一百五十多万斤，占全县去年棉花总产量增产部分的20％，使全县棉花总产量比前年增产69％。
    各种“王”的出现，大大打开了四川广大干部和群众的眼界。今年全省农业生产一开始就出现了万马奔腾的形势。广大地区的人民公社纷纷用新的产量标准结合当前实际条件，订出和修订了今年继续跃进的指标和措施，开展了轰轰烈烈的社会主义生产大竞赛。全省人民根据各种“王”和两年来大面积高产的经验，抓早、抓紧、抓好，进行了小春作物的生产和春耕生产准备工作，力争今年农业生产继续跃进。
    本报讯　四川各地在“小春半年粮”的豪迈口号鼓舞下，正千方百计增加夏粮和蔬菜的产量。
    四川省今年小春粮食作物播种时间提早一个节令，种植面积扩大25％，并利用一切闲散土地增种夏收作物。田间管理也比往年抓得早、抓得紧、抓得细。
    四川省几年来特别是近两年大跃进的经验证明，扩大春洋芋的种植面积，是增加夏收粮食比重、提高土地利用率的一项重要措施。春洋芋的生长时间只有九十到一百天，又是玉米、高粱、红薯、水稻的良好前作，同时可以和许多作物进行轮作、套作、间作，去年绝大部分地区亩产在二千斤左右。现在，大种春洋芋的群众运动已在全省各地形成高潮。去年平均亩产高达二千八百八十多斤的武隆县，今年播种面积将在去年二万七千亩的基础上扩大二倍多。南江县今年春洋芋种植面积由四万四千亩扩大到十二万亩。
    大种瓜豆和春菜的群众运动，已在全省展开。许多公社发动全民利用屋前屋后空地种南瓜，争取每人至少收获一百斤。西充县大搞温床育苗，提早栽种时间，已种南瓜二百十五万窝，总产量至少在二千万斤以上。江津专区充分运用去年蔬菜丰产经验，见缝插针，种春菜五十万亩，种瓜豆二亿窝，保证春夏两季每人至少有蔬菜一千斤以上。南充专区最近几天中每人已种菜三百多窝，种下以后，立即普遍追肥，并固定专人建立了田间管理制度，全专区每户还准备好了百窝瓜千窝豆的种子。
    新华社成都5日电　四川省各地正在积极准备大春作物优良品种，打算今年在大力提高作物单位面积产量的同时，普遍采取套种、间种等方法，提高复种指数，争取多种多收。根据这一计划，各地今年大量推广了各种生长期短，产量高，抗旱、抗病力强的作物良种。许多地方从去年年底就开始进行种子检查、翻晒、精选和调换等工作。到目前为止，各地互相调剂的早稻、早玉米等种子，已有二十多种、三千多万斤。
