After returning to China, she often excitedly told those who welcomed her: 'I have a "hand of Sino-Soviet friendship" now. I will study diligently and work hard according to the needs of the Party, and use this "hand of Sino-Soviet friendship" to contribute all my strength to the socialist construction of the motherland and to Sino-Soviet friendship.'" The telegram concluded with heartfelt thanks and cordial greetings to the Party, Soviet, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations of Chita, as well as to Romanov himself, his family, and all the staff of the Chita Orthopedic Equipment Factory.
