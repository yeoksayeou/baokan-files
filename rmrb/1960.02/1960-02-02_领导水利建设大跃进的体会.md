Experiences in Leading the Great Leap Forward in Water Conservancy Construction
Zhang Yuqing, Deputy Secretary-General of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee

The people of Jiangxi, with their glorious revolutionary traditions, launched a large-scale water conservancy campaign last winter and this spring, achieving tremendous results.

After more than two months of hard work, 304 large and medium-sized water conservancy projects have been completed, more than 5,000 small-scale water conservancy projects irrigating over 1,000 mu and under 10,000 mu have been built, preliminary control has been achieved over soil erosion in more than 4,000 square kilometers, and 100,000 kilometers of canals have been excavated, bringing water conservancy facilities to over 90% of the farmland. Many communes and some counties have formed water conservancy and irrigation systems combining reservoirs, ponds, ditches, and large, medium, and small projects. After the completion of all water conservancy construction tasks for this year, the province will have nearly 500 large and medium-sized water conservancy projects, and many medium and small rivers will be basically harnessed.

The rapid development of water conservancy has powerfully promoted the continuous leap forward in agricultural production. In May and June 1959, the Fu, Xin, Xiu, and Rao rivers experienced several major floods; since July, there have been nearly 100 days of drought in the autumn. However, under the leadership of the Party and the government, relying on the great power of the people's communes and the water conservancy projects already built, the people of the province overcame the water and drought disasters, achieving an all-round bumper harvest of early, middle, and late rice, and realizing a continuous leap forward in agricultural production on the basis of the Great Leap Forward of 1958. Dongxiang County, known for its low yields due to frequent droughts in the past, built ten medium-sized reservoirs irrigating more than 10,000 mu and connected them to more than 20,000 small projects, making 70% of the county's farmland achieve self-flowing irrigation. In 1959, the total grain output increased by 40% compared to 1958, and the yield per unit area increased by 50%. The masses enthusiastically sang about the harvest, praising the great achievements in water management. They said: "The flood is like a dragon, a fierce dragon with a rolling momentum; we build an iron chain to lock it in the reservoir." "The Party's leadership is a good idea, building oceans in deep mountains and ridges; high mountains bow their heads, and water obeys, clear water flows to irrigate the fields; we are not afraid of drought for a hundred days without rain, and the reservoir stores heavy rain; agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery all leap forward together, and we never forget the Communist Party in the harvest."

The rapid development of water conservancy has also powerfully promoted the all-round leap forward in power generation, fish farming, transportation, and other undertakings. The province has excavated 1,400 kilometers of main and branch canals navigable by boat, built 5,000 to 6,000 kilometers of roads due to water conservancy construction, built more than 130 rural hydropower stations, and expanded the water surface by 1.5 million mu, which can raise 15 billion fish fry annually. Many areas have also combined water conservancy construction with opening new ditches, filling old ditches, draining stagnant water, and introducing flowing water, eliminating snails, sending away the plague god, and the rural life has taken on a new look.

Through the Great Leap Forward in water conservancy construction over the past two years, we have deeply realized that to carry out water conservancy construction on a large scale, we must first adhere to putting politics in command, carry out mass movements on a large scale, and exert all our efforts to strive for the top, in order to overcome all difficulties and move forward continuously. It is impossible to carry out water conservancy construction on a large scale without being afraid of difficulties and without the ambition to move mountains and overturn seas. The mass movement for water conservancy construction in our province, like that in other parts of the country, started in the winter of 1957. Its development law is that the movement develops more and more widely, deeply, thoroughly, and vigorously, and the number of water conservancy construction projects also increases more and more, becomes larger and larger, faster and faster, and more and more economical. In the winter of 1957, we guided the masses to recall comparisons, calculate the labor costs of drought resistance and flood prevention and the losses caused by disasters, break superstitions, and encourage hard work, setting off the first upsurge in water conservancy construction. In 1958, the water conservancy construction movement further deepened. In order to open up thinking, we conducted extensive debates on the topics of "whether or not to carry out water conservancy on a large scale, whether it is possible to carry it out on a large scale, and how to carry it out." At the same time, we conducted comprehensive surveys and key investigations, analyzed data, clarified accounts, and investigated rainfall patterns, and a series of preparatory work; and organized a large number of people to visit various places inside and outside the province, and timely convened water conservancy on-site meetings, strengthened the confidence and determination to carry out water conservancy on a large scale, and set off the second upsurge in water conservancy construction. Last winter and this spring, the water conservancy tasks were even more important, and the mass movement was even more extensive; but some areas believed that "the water source conditions are very good there, and there is no need to carry out water conservancy on a large scale," "the geographical conditions are very poor, and it is impossible to carry out water conservancy on a large scale," "there is no steel or cement, and it is impossible to carry out water conservancy on a large scale," etc.; these ideas seriously hindered the widespread and in-depth development of the water conservancy construction movement. We summarized the experiences of Dongxiang, Linchuan, and other counties in carrying out water conservancy construction in a faster, better, and more economical way, and timely and powerfully refuted the "wait-and-see faction," the "hand-stretching faction," and the "head-down faction" that succumbed to difficulties in water conservancy construction, setting off the third upsurge in water conservancy construction. Through carrying out mass movements on a large scale, more and more masses have more clearly understood the benefits of water conservancy construction and established the idea of being masters of nature. Once the mind is liberated, courage increases a hundredfold, and the upsurges in water conservancy construction are higher and higher, and the power is stronger and stronger. In 1957, the province built 47 medium-sized projects irrigating more than 10,000 mu, which increased to 257 in 1958, and 375 have already been started last winter. Moreover, the water storage capacity of the projects irrigating 10,000 mu built before 1958 was generally only about 10 million cubic meters, and the largest one was no more than 30 million cubic meters; however, among the 375 projects irrigating more than 10,000 mu that started construction last winter, there were ten large reservoirs with a water storage capacity of more than 100 million cubic meters, and 28 projects irrigating more than 50,000 mu. The large number of projects, the large scale, but the use of very little equipment is another feature of water conservancy construction last winter and this spring. In 1957, the average amount of equipment used for projects irrigating more than 10,000 mu was 56 tons, which was 30 tons in 1958, and only 24 tons last winter. In 1958, the province's farmland water conservancy construction used a total of more than 26,800 tons of equipment, of which 74% was solved by the masses through self-reliance.

Vigorously carrying out tool reform, vigorously carrying out technological innovation, and carrying out high-efficiency mass movements are the fundamental measures to overcome the shortage of labor, accelerate the speed of water conservancy construction, and ensure the quality of projects. Because the tasks of earth and stone work in large and medium-sized projects are large, this requires more labor to be invested in order to strive for construction in the same year and benefit in the same year. Jiangxi is an old revolutionary base area, and during the Great Revolution and the domestic revolutionary war, it was subjected to a large number of massacres by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the population was greatly reduced, and the labor force was very insufficient. Large tasks and less labor are the actual difficulties in large-scale water conservancy construction. The only way out is to vigorously carry out tool reform, vigorously carry out technological innovation, and carry out high-efficiency movements. In the water conservancy construction movement, due to firmly grasping this important measure and mobilizing the masses to offer suggestions and ideas, water conservancy construction tools have been continuously reformed, the labor efficiency has been increased by several times or ten times, the project progress has been accelerated, and the project quality has been ensured. At the beginning of the large-scale water conservancy movement last winter, a mass movement of high efficiency and high quality with tool reform and technological innovation as the center was fully carried out. Various water conservancy construction sites have set up construction site factories on a large scale. At present, more than 4,000 various factories have been established, creating and promoting more than 900,000 pieces of advanced tools after finalization. Under the conditions of more stone work and longer transportation distances, the average labor efficiency reached 4.1 cubic meters, which is more than double that of 1958. If we only look at the medium-sized projects, the average labor efficiency reached about 7 cubic meters, and some reached more than 10 cubic meters.

The development process of tool reform in water conservancy construction in our province is from low to high, from simple to complex, from individual processes to all processes. From human power to cattle power to mechanical power, the combination of human, cattle, and machine is implemented. Tool reform first started from the soil transportation tool, and a large number of soil transportation vehicles were manufactured. After the breakthrough of the soil transportation tool, the contradiction that the excavation, loading, unloading, and compaction processes could not keep up with the soil transportation speed quickly appeared. Therefore, a comprehensive reform of the excavation, loading, unloading, and compaction processes was carried out again, changing manual excavation to cattle plowing, to machine farming, and then to blasting; changing manual ramming to cattle-pulled roller compaction, to mechanical soil compaction, and combining the reform of the soil excavation and loading tools. Especially as water conservancy construction has developed to a new stage of building a large number of large and medium-sized backbone projects and water conservancy systematization, the dams of projects have become higher and higher, and the canal tasks have become larger and larger, and difficulties in long-distance soil transportation, high dam soil loading, and deep canal excavation have emerged. Under the pressure of this new situation, tool reform has entered a new stage of power traction and directional blasting. The Ziyunshan Reservoir in Fengcheng County realized vehicle transportation in 1958, which increased the labor efficiency by several times compared with manual soil carrying; in 1959, on the basis of vehicle transportation, the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, mainly indigenous methods, was further implemented, and mechanical power was used to create six advanced tools such as high dam soil transportation winches and long-distance soil transportation traction machines, basically realizing semi-mechanization and mechanization of construction, and the labor efficiency was increased by more than ten times compared with vehicle transportation. Gaoan County wanted to open a canal spanning three large and small mountains for 17 li. They adopted directional blasting, and it took only ten days, 196 workers, and 33,000 jin of explosives to complete the entire project, saving about 33,000 man-days compared with manual excavation, saving 50,000 yuan in funds, and shortening the time by 50 days.

While carrying out the tool reform and technological innovation movement, it is also necessary to continuously improve labor organization and carry out appraisal competitions. People are the decisive factor in improving productivity. With good advanced tools, there must also be people to master and use them in order to fully exert their role. Therefore, according to the development of tool reform, we continuously rectified and improved the labor organization, made reasonable division of labor and close cooperation between various processes and types of work, carried out high-efficiency red flag competition movements, strengthened quota management, made the excavation, loading, transportation, unloading, and compaction processes closely cooperate and coordinate with each other, so that the labor organization and advanced tools are adapted to each other, one link is closely linked to another, and the labor efficiency is comprehensively improved.

Strengthening the Party's specific leadership over the water conservancy movement is the fundamental guarantee for victory. Because the scale of medium-sized water conservancy projects is generally larger, the tasks are arduous, the labor force is concentrated, the technology is complex, especially after the realization of semi-mechanized and mechanized construction, the operation procedures are required to be more compact, and the cooperation of relevant departments needs to be more strict, which requires further strengthening the Party's leadership. In carrying out the water conservancy construction movement in our province, water conservancy construction command organizations have been established from top to bottom, and construction command headquarters have been established at various construction sites. In terms of leadership methods, we emphasize doing a good job in the political and ideological work of the construction sites, paying attention to cultivating typical examples, establishing pacesetters, and promoting the overall situation. In order to strive for construction in the same year and benefit in the same year, various places, according to the size and urgency of winter production tasks, highlighted the center, widely organized collaboration and support between communes, between upstream and downstream, and between departments, and accelerated the progress of water conservancy construction. For example, the Ji'an Special Zone adopted the "five-character" measures of early, ruthless, breakthrough, collaboration, and work, concentrated more than 60% of the labor force to carry out water conservancy construction, the secretaries of various counties personally took the lead to guide, and various departments closely cooperated, fighting for 50 days, and basically completed the winter repair tasks; and gradually transferred the main labor force to blitz fertilizer accumulation, striving for the initiative in work. Therefore, all winter tasks were done earlier and better than in previous years.

Over the past two years, the Great Leap Forward in water conservancy construction in Jiangxi has laid a favorable foundation for the realization of water conservancy in the province. The people of the province are advancing victoriously, determined to work hard for another two or three winters and springs to eliminate general water and drought disasters throughout the province.

    领导水利建设大跃进的体会
    中共江西省委副秘书长　张宇晴
    富有光荣革命传统的江西人民，去冬今春大兴水利运动，取得了巨大成绩。
    经过两个多月的奋战，已建成大、中型水利工程三百零四座，灌溉千亩以上、万亩以下的小型水利工程五千多座，初步控制了水土流失面积四千多平方公里，开挖渠道十万公里，使90％以上的农田有了水利设施。许多公社和一部分县已经形成了库塘相接、沟渠相通、大中小型工程相结合的水利灌溉系统。这一年度的水利建设任务全部完成后，全省就有将近五百座大、中型水利工程，许多中、小河流就可得到基本治理。
    水利建设的迅速发展，有力地促进了农业生产的不断跃进。1959年5、6月间，抚、信、修、饶各河都发生了几次较大洪水；7月以来又发生了近百天的伏秋干旱。但是全省人民在党和政府的领导下，依靠人民公社和已经建成的水利工程的巨大威力，战胜了水旱灾害，获得了早、中、晚稻全面丰收，农业生产在1958年大跃进的基础上，又实现了连续大跃进。过去十年九旱、以低产著称的东乡县，由于兴建了十座灌溉万亩以上的中型水库，连接二万多座小型工程，使全县70％的农田实现了灌溉自流化，1959年粮食总产量比1958年增产四成，单位面积产量提高五成。群众热情地歌唱丰收，盛赞治水的伟大成就。他们说：“洪水好比一条龙，恶龙滚滚气势凶，我们打条铁锁链，把它锁在水库中。”“党的领导好主张，深山大岭造海洋，高山低头水听话，清水长流灌田庄，百日无雨不受旱，大雨倾盆水库装，农林牧渔齐跃进，丰收不忘共产党。”
    水利建设的迅速发展，还有力地促进了发电、养鱼、交通运输等事业的全面跃进。全省开挖干、支渠道可通航一千四百公里，因修水利而兴建的公路有五、六千公里，建成农村水电站一百三十多座，扩大水面一百五十万亩，每年可养鱼一百五十亿尾。许多地区还结合兴修水利，开新沟、填旧沟，排死水、引活水，消灭了钉螺，送走了瘟神，农村生活面貌焕然一新。
    经过两年以来的水利建设大跃进，我们深深地体会到：大搞水利建设，首先必须坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，鼓足干劲，力争上游，才能排除万难，不断前进。害怕困难，没有移山倒海的雄心大志，就不可能大搞水利建设。我省大搞水利建设群众运动和全国各地一样，是从1957年冬季开始的。它的发展规律是：运动发展得越来越广、越深、越透、越猛，水利建设的项目也越来越多、越大、越快、越省。1957年冬我们引导群众回忆对比，算抗旱防涝的劳力账和灾情损失账，破迷信、鼓干劲，掀起了第一个水利建设高潮。1958年水利建设运动进一步深入，为了打通思想，以“要不要大搞水利，能不能大搞，如何大搞”等为题，广泛开展辩论。同时，我们进行了全面勘察和重点调查，分析资料，算清水账，摸透降雨规律等一系列的准备工作；并且组织大批人员到省内外各地参观，及时召开水利现场会议，坚定了大搞水利的信心和决心，掀起了第二个水利建设高潮。去冬今春水利任务更加重大，群众运动更加广泛；但也有个别地区认为他们那里“水源条件很好，用不着大搞水利”、“地理条件很差，无法大搞水利”、“没有钢筋、水泥，不能大搞水利”等等；这些思想严重地阻碍着水利建设运动的广泛深入的开展。我们总结了东乡、临川等县多快好省大搞水利建设的经验，及时有力地驳斥了水利建设中的“观潮派”、“伸手派”和向困难屈服的“低头派”，掀起了第三个水利建设高潮。通过大搞群众运动，使愈来愈多的群众更加清楚地懂得了兴修水利的好处，树立了作自然主宰的思想。思想一经解放，勇气就百倍增长，水利建设的高潮一次比一次更高，威力一次比一次强大。1957年全省兴修灌溉万亩以上中型工程四十七座，1958年增到二百五十七座，去年冬天已经开工兴建的达到三百七十五座。而且1958年以前兴修的灌溉万亩的工程，蓄水量一般都只一千万立方左右，最大的也不过蓄水三千万立方；可是去冬动工的三百七十五座灌溉万亩以上的工程中，能蓄水一亿立方以上的大型水库有十座，灌溉五万亩以上的工程有二十八座。工程数量多，规模大，器材却用的很少，这是去冬今春水利建设的又一个特点。1957年灌溉万亩以上工程平均用器材五十六吨，1958年为三十吨，而去冬只用二十四吨。1958年全省农田水利建设共用器材二万六千八百多吨，其中群众自力更生解决的占74％。
    大搞工具改革，大闹技术革新，开展高工效群众运动，是克服劳力不足，加快水利建设速度，保证工程质量的根本措施。　由于大、中型工程土、石方任务大，这就需要投入更多的劳动力，才能争取当年兴修、当年受益。而江西是一个革命老根据地，在大革命和国内革命战争时期，曾经遭到国民党反动派的大批屠杀，人口大大减少，劳动力非常不足。任务大，劳力少，这是大规模进行水利建设中的实际困难。唯一的出路，就是大搞工具改革，大闹技术革新，开展高工效运动。在水利建设运动中，由于紧紧地抓住了这一条重要措施，发动群众献计献策，水利施工工具不断革新，成倍成十倍地提高了劳动工效，加快了工程进度，保证了工程质量。去年冬天大兴水利的运动一开始，就全面开展了以工具改革和技术革新为中心的高工效高质量的群众运动。各水利工地大办工地工厂，目前已兴办各种工厂四千多个，创造推广经过定型的先进工具九十多万件。在石方任务较多、运距较长的条件下，平均工效达到四点一方，比1958年提高一倍以上。如果仅就中型工程来看，平均工效达到七方左右，部分的达到十方以上。
    我省水利施工工具改革的发展过程，是由低到高，由简到繁，由个别工序到全部工序。由人力到牛力到机械动力，实行人、牛、机三结合。工具改革首先是从运土工具开始，大量制造运土车辆。运土工具突破以后，很快出现了挖、装、卸、压工序跟不上运土速度的矛盾。于是，又进行了挖、装、卸、压各个工序的全面改革，改人挖为牛犁，为机耕，进而到爆破；改人力打夯为牛拉磙压，到机械压土，并结合改革上下土工具。特别是水利建设发展到大量兴建大、中型骨干工程和水利系统化的新阶段，工程大坝越来越高，渠道任务越来越大，出现了远距离运土、高坝上土和深挖渠道的困难。在这种新的形势逼迫下，工具改革又进到了动力牵引和定向爆破的新阶段。丰城县紫云山水库，1958年实现了车子化，比人工挑土工效提高几倍；1959年又在车子化的基础上，进一步贯彻了土洋结合，以土为主的原则，利用机械动力，创造了高坝运土卷扬机和远距离运土牵引机等六种先进工具，基本上实现了施工半机械化和机械化，工效比车子化又提高了十几倍。高安县要开一条横跨大小三个山头十七华里的渠道，他们采取定向爆破，只用了十天时间，一百九十六个人工，三万三千斤炸药，就全部完成，约比人工开挖省工三万三千多个，节约资金五万元，缩短时间五十天。
    在开展工具改革和技术革新运动的同时，还必须不断改善劳动组织，开展评比竞赛。人是提高生产率的决定因素，有了好的先进工具，还必须要有人去掌握使用，才能充分发挥它的作用。因此，我们根据工具改革的发展，不断整顿健全劳动组织，作好各工序、工种之间的合理分工和密切配合，开展高工效红旗竞赛运动，加强定额管理，使挖、装、运、卸、压各工序紧密配合，互相协调，使劳动组织和先进工具相适应，一环紧扣一环，全面提高工效。
    加强党对水利运动的具体领导，是取得胜利的根本保证。　由于中型水利工程的规模一般较大，任务艰巨，劳力集中，技术复杂，特别是实现半机械化和机械化施工以后，操作程序要求更加紧凑，有关部门的配合需要更加严密，这就必须进一步加强党的领导。我省在开展水利建设运动中，自上而下建立了兴修水利的指挥机构，各工地并建立了施工指挥部。在领导方法上，强调作好工地的政治思想工作，注意培养典型，树立标兵，推动全面。为了争取当年施工、当年受益，各地根据冬季生产任务的大、小和时间缓急，突出中心，广泛组织公社与公社之间、上下游之间和部门之间的协作支援，加快水利建设进度。如吉安专区采取早、狠、突、协、工“五字”措施，集中了60％以上的劳动力兴修水利，各县书记亲自上阵指导，各个部门密切配合，大战五十天，基本完成了冬修任务；并逐渐把主要劳动力转入突击积肥，争取了工作的主动。因此，冬季各项工作都较往年干的早、干的好。
    两年以来，江西的水利建设大跃进，为实现全省的水利化打下了有利基础。全省人民正在乘胜前进，决心再大干二、三个冬春，在全省范围内消灭一般性的水旱灾害。
