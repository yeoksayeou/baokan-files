    A New Starting Point
    Although we prepare for plowing every year, and carry out spring plowing every year, this year's preparations and spring plowing are vastly different from those of previous years. Under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, the brave and industrious farmers of the whole country are using the spirit of continuous revolution to make the face of production change with each passing day. Even in one part of the preparations—the preparation of agricultural tools—we can see a new starting point for agricultural technical transformation.

    Due to the further implementation of the policy of taking grain as the key link, comprehensively developing diverse economies, and striving for multiple high-yield harvests, this year not only has the sown area of various crops been greatly expanded, but also more stringent requirements have been placed on cultivation techniques. Consequently, the demand for labor in this year’s agricultural production, especially spring plowing, has also increased significantly compared to previous years. To realize a comprehensive and sustained leap forward in 1960 and overcome the contradiction between heavy tasks and insufficient labor, we must further increase labor efficiency. Vigorously carrying out tool reform is, of course, a very important measure to improve work efficiency. Many places, from the very beginning of preparations, have tightly grasped this important link of tool reform and technical innovation, creating and promoting a large number of new-style tools, and new improvements have also been made in operating techniques. Therefore, spring plowing production there has been carried out both quickly and well.

    The characteristic of this year's tool reform is to implement a complete set of tool innovations targeted at the processes that consume the most labor and have the greatest labor intensity in the local area. For example, many counties in Zhejiang Province, in response to fertilizer accumulation, which consumes the most labor during preparations, have reformed the entire set of tools for accumulating, transporting, and applying fertilizer in plains and mountainous areas. Wusheng County in Sichuan Province focuses its tool reforms and technical innovations on the four production processes with the greatest labor intensity and the closest relationship to achieving a great agricultural harvest: deep plowing and soil preparation, water lifting and irrigation, planting and sowing, and harvesting and threshing. First, semi-mechanization and improved tooling are realized in these processes. This gradual process, from point to surface, from single-item tool reform to complete set tool reform, will not only guarantee a better and more comprehensive leap forward in this year's agricultural production but also create conditions for the gradual realization of semi-mechanization and mechanization of agricultural production in our country.

    On the one hand, we must improve tools, and on the other hand, we also need skilled workers who can use the new tools. Skilled new agricultural tool users are often the best promoters of tool reform. Through their advanced production practices, they will broaden the horizons of the masses and break down conservative thinking, allowing new tools and new operating techniques to spread widely. At the same time, in practice, they are often the most capable of combining production practice and proposing improvements, making the new tools even more perfect. It can be said that after new tools are created, the timely training and cultivation of a large number of skilled workers who can master the new tools becomes the link to practically apply the new tools to production. Whether this work is done well or not greatly affects the effectiveness of tool reform. Xiangtan Prefecture in Hunan Province held a new tool evaluation competition sports meet, and through selecting contestants to attend the "sports meet," counties and communes held training classes at all levels, training 150,000 skilled workers in the use of new tools. This is a very fresh and vivid format that can be considered for emulation in various places.

    In addition, during preparations and spring plowing, we must not only grasp the promotion of new-style tools with higher work efficiency to greatly improve this year's production but also pay attention to the preparation of general agricultural tools, which are still the largest in number and indispensable at this stage. We must not only pay attention to the preparation of large agricultural tools such as plows, harrows, and waterwheels but also not neglect the supply of small agricultural tools such as shoulder poles and sickles. Because sometimes the inefficiency of farm work or labor is often affected by the unavailability of certain small agricultural tools. Wusheng County in Sichuan Province prepared enough tools for each laborer and each draft cattle for use in various conditions such as dry land, paddy fields, sunny days, and rainy days during spring plowing preparations. This approach is meticulous, comprehensive, proactive, and appropriate, and is a very good practice.

    All of the above shows that in this year's production, in the agricultural technical reform movement, we have a new starting point. We are striving for high speed and striving to realize a new, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year through the tool reform movement.

    新的起点
    虽然是年年备耕，年年春耕，但是今年的备耕和春耕又和往年大不相同。勇敢勤劳的全国农民，在总路线的光辉照耀下，正以不断革命的精神，使生产的面貌日新月异，就在备耕的一部分——农具准备工作中，我们也可以看到农业技术改造的新的起点。
    由于以粮为纲，全面发展多种经济和多种高产多收方针的进一步贯彻，今年不仅各种作物的播种面积大大扩大，耕作技术也要求得更加严格了，因而今年的农业生产首先是春耕生产所需要的劳动力也比往年大大增加，为了实现1960年全面持续的跃进，克服任务重、劳力不足的矛盾，就必须进一步提高劳动效率。大搞工具改革，当然是提高工效的一个十分重要的措施。许多地方一开始备耕，就紧紧抓住了工具改革和技术革新这一重要环节，创造和推广了大量的新式工具，操作技术也有了新的改进，因而，他们那里的春耕生产搞的又快又好。
    今年工具改革的特点是针对当时当地占用劳力最多、劳动强度最大的工序，实现成套的工具革新。例如浙江省许多县针对备耕中占劳力最多的积肥，改革了平原和山区的积肥、运肥和施肥的整套工具；四川武胜县则以深耕整地、提水灌溉、栽插播种、收割脱粒等劳动强度最大，与实现农业大丰收关系最为密切的四项生产过程为工具改革和技术革新的重点，首先在这些工序实现半机械化和改良工具化。这样由点到面，由单项工具改革到成套的工具改革，逐步提高，不仅可以保证今年农业生产更好更全面的跃进，也为我国农业生产逐步实现半机械化和机械化创造着条件。
    一方面要改良工具，另一方面还需要有会使用新工具的能手。熟练的新农具手常常就是工具改革最好的宣传员。通过他们先进的生产实践，就会打开广大群众的眼界，破除守旧思想，使新工具和新的操作技术广泛地传播开去。同时，在实践中，他们又往往最能结合生产实践，提出改进意见，使新的工具更趋完善。可以说，新工具创制出来以后，及时地培养和训练大批掌握新工具的能手，就成为把新工具实际运用到生产中去的结合点。这一工作做得好与不好，在很大程度上影响到工具改革的成效。湖南省湘潭专区举办了新工具评比竞赛运动会，通过选拔出席“运动会”的选手，县和公社层层举办训练班，培养了使用新工具的能手十五万人，这是十分新鲜、生动的形式，各地可以考虑仿办。
    此外，在备耕和春耕生产活动中，既要抓住工效更高的新式工具的推广，以便将今年的生产大大提高一步，同时也还要注意在现阶段还是数量最大而又不可缺少的一般农具的准备；既要注意犁、耙、水车等大农具的准备，也不要忽略扁担、镰刀等小农具的供应。因为有的时候常常是因为某些小农具的不凑手而影响了农活或劳动的效率。四川省武胜县在春耕准备中为每个劳动力和每条耕牛备足在旱地、水田、天晴、下雨等各种条件下使用的工具，这种做法既细致、又全面，既主动、又妥善，是一个很好的作法。
    以上这一切都说明：在今年的生产中，在农业技术改革运动中，我们有了新的起点，我们正在通过工具改革运动，力争高速度，力争实现今年新的更好更全面的跃进。
