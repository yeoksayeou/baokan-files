The north wind howls, the village is extremely quiet. Comrade Chen, from the commune's home for the elderly, went out with a pair of bamboo baskets. Comrade Chen turned past the west village and skirted the east village, gathering two large baskets of cow dung. He met the Party Branch Secretary on the way, who took the dung baskets and said: "The charcoal in your stove at home is burning brightly, why are you not at home warming yourself but out picking up dung? Comrade Chen, you are really something! Tonight I will fine you three cups of sweet wine!"
