Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, February 5th: The Da Yao People's Commune Agricultural Science Research Institute in Liuyang County, Hunan Province, has been conducting a series of research activities closely centered on spring planting. They have promptly provided the commune party committee and commune members with a wealth of information and good suggestions, powerfully promoting the current spring planting preparations.

In order to ensure the continued leap forward in agricultural production for the entire commune this year, the Agricultural Science Research Institute conducted four inspections of the eradication of overwintering rice borer larvae from November of last year to mid-January of this year. Although weeds and rice stubble in the commune's fields had been cleared and used for fertilizer pits, the larvae had not been completely eliminated. In the fertilizer pits of the Xinwu Production Team, they pulled out forty-five rice stubble clumps and found thirty-five living larvae. After research, they concluded that the main reason the rice borer larvae in the stubble hadn't died was that the fertilizer pits were too dry, still suitable for the larvae to live in. Based on this finding, they reported the inspection results to the commune and proposed the "Five Haves and Four Diligences" method to eliminate overwintering rice borers. The Five Haves are: the fertilizer pits must have lime, water, manure, weeds, and rice stubble. The Four Diligences are: diligent turning of the pits, diligent watering, diligent adding of manure, and diligent inspection. This can not only eliminate overwintering rice borers within a week, but also improve fertilizer efficiency. Based on their report, the commune party committee immediately gave specific instructions to all brigades and production teams. All production teams in the commune universally inspected the winter fields and adopted the "Five Haves and Four Diligences" method to eliminate pests.

While eliminating overwintering pests, the Agricultural Science Research Institute organized personnel from the Soil and Fertilizer Group and the Crop Cultivation Group. On the one hand, they systematically organized the data from last year's fertilizer experiments on eight types of fertilizer. On the other hand, they conducted investigations at the Leisha Production Team, which had the highest yield last year, and initially grasped the relationship between yield levels and the amount of fertilizer, soil quality. They have already submitted preliminary opinions to the commune party committee on how much nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizer should be applied per mu of land.

Based on past, especially last year's, experience, a crucial key to achieving a bumper grain harvest is appropriately advancing the planting season and extending the crop growing period. Based on this experience, the Da Yao Agricultural Science Research Institute conducted early experiments on "high-temperature rapid seedling raising technology." Soaking time was shortened from the original forty-eight hours to about seven hours; germination time was shortened from the original three or four days to seven or eight hours. From soaking and germination to seedling raising, not only can the time be greatly shortened, allowing for earlier transplanting, but it can also ensure that rotting seedlings will not occur, and it doesn't require a lot of time and manpower to care for the seedlings. The commune party committee plans to hold an on-site meeting to comprehensively promote this new technology.

During the spring planting preparation activities, the six comrades of the Da Yao Agricultural Science Research Institute's Meteorology Group have also been very busy. Since the beginning of January, they have collected various meteorological data from Liuyang County and the Da Yao Commune area for the past eight years, and conducted detailed research and analysis. They have tracked the temperature changes over the years on a daily basis, thereby grasping the patterns of temperature changes and identifying the cold wave periods and periods suitable for rice sowing and growth over the years. They have provided the commune party committee with specific opinions on when it is suitable to soak and sow seeds. At the same time, they also use weather forecasts and other methods to publicize to the masses, eliminating the people's concerns.

This year, the Da Yao Commune plans to vigorously promote rice transplanting by machine. The Agricultural Science Research Institute has also made many technical preparations in this regard. In addition to being responsible for the technical evaluation of the transplanters, they have also compiled technical materials on "Operating Procedures for Rice Transplanters." They are currently actively preparing to open a "Transplanter Operator Training Class" to train transplanter operators.

The Da Yao Commune's Agricultural Science Research Institute was established in 1958. At that time, the institute only had twelve young commune members with primary and higher primary school education levels. Under the care and leadership of the commune party committee, it has now grown to forty-six people. The institute has a laboratory, a hydrology and meteorology station, and a pest forecasting station. The instruments and equipment are all solved through methods of using local resources to replace foreign resources, and combining local and foreign methods. In 1959, the research institute completed a total of one hundred and thirteen scientific research projects, which played a significant role in agricultural production.

    围绕春耕生产开展科学研究
    大瑶公社农业科学研究所提供许多丰富资料
    新华社长沙5日电　湖南浏阳县大瑶人民公社农业科学研究所，紧密围绕春耕生产，进行了一系列的研究活动，向公社党委和社员及时地提供了许多丰富资料和好建议，有力地推动了当前的备耕工作。
    为了保证全社今年农业生产继续跃进，这个农业科学研究所从去年11月到今年元月中旬，共对越冬螟虫幼虫的消灭情况进行了四次检查。全社田里的杂草和禾蔸虽然都铲光了，沤了肥凼，但是幼虫并未全部肃清。他们在新屋生产队的肥凼  里拔出四十五个禾蔸进行检查，仍然发现有三十五个活的幼虫。经过研究，他们认为禾蔸里螟虫幼虫未死的主要原因是肥凼过于干燥，仍适于螟虫生活，根据这个情况。他们向公社汇报了检查结果，提出了“五有四勤”的办法来消灭越冬螟虫。五有是肥凼里要有石灰、有水、有粪、有杂草、有禾蔸；四勤是勤翻凼、勤灌水、勤添粪、勤检查。这样不仅能在一个星期内消灭越冬螟虫，而且可以提高肥效。公社党委根据他们的汇报，立即向各大队和生产队作了具体的指示，全社各生产队都普遍对冬田进行了检查，采取了“五有四勤”的办法消灭虫害。
    在消灭越冬害虫的同时，农科所组织土壤肥料组和作物栽培组的人员，一方面系统地整理去年对八种肥料试验结果的资料，另方面到去年产量最高的磊沙生产队进行调查，初步摸到了产量高低和肥料多少、土质好坏的关系，已向公社党委提出了每亩田要施多少含氮、磷、钾的肥料的初步意见。
    根据往年特别是去年的经验，粮食丰产的一个重要关键就是适当提早种植季节，延长作物生长期。根据这样一条经验，大瑶农科所及早作了“高温快速育秧技术”的试验，浸种的时间由原来的四十八小时缩短到七小时左右；催芽的时间由原来的三、四天缩短到七、八个小时，从浸种、催芽到育秧，不仅时间可以大大缩短，能够提早插秧，而且可以保证不会出现烂秧现象，也不需要花很多的时间和人力去照顾秧苗。对这项新技术，公社党委准备召开现场会，全面推广。
    在备耕活动中，大瑶农科所气象组的六个同志也非常忙碌，他们从元月初开始就搜集了浏阳县和大瑶公社地区内八年来的各种气象资料，进行了细致的研究和分析，把历年来的气温变化情况进行了逐日排队，从而摸出了气温变化的规律，找出了历年来的寒潮期和适于水稻播种和生长的时期，向公社党委提出了什么时候适宜浸种和播种等具体意见，同时他们还通过气象预报等办法向群众进行宣传，消除群众的顾虑。
    今年，大瑶公社准备大力推广插秧机插秧，农科所在这方面也作了许多技术准备工作。他们除了负责对插秧机进行技术鉴定以外，还编印了“插秧机操作规程”的技术资料，目前正积极准备开办“插秧机手训练班”，训练插秧机手。
    大瑶公社的农业科学研究所是1958年成立的，当时所里的成员，只有十二名具有高小和初小文化水平的青年社员。在公社党委的关怀和领导下，现在已经发展到四十六人。所里已经有了化验室和水文气象站、虫情预测站，仪器设备都是采取以土代洋、土洋结合的办法解决的。1959年，这个研究所共完成了一百一十三个科学研究项目，对农业生产起了很大的作用。
