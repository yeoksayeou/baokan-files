    Taking Early Action to Prevent Pig Diseases
    Beijing Suburbs Carry Out Epidemic Prevention Work, Wuning, Jiangxi Strengthens Quarantine Work
    Jingjiang County, Jiangsu Province Improves Feeding Management to Eliminate Swine Fever and Swine Erysipelas
    According to Xinhua News Agency on the 12th, Beijing's suburban counties and people's communes are taking early action, actively organizing forces from all aspects to carry out spring livestock epidemic prevention activities centered on preventing and controlling pig diseases.

    February, March and April are the seasons when pig infectious diseases are most likely to spread. More than 600 veterinarians in more than 400 veterinary hospitals (stations) in the suburbs, nearly 3,000 full-time epidemic prevention personnel, and a large number of part-time epidemic prevention personnel recently trained in various counties (districts) have all been put into pig injection, prevention, and treatment work. As of now, the injection and prevention work in Fangshan and other three counties (districts), which took action earlier, has been completed, and other counties (districts) will also complete it before the beginning of March, generally about a month earlier than in previous years.

    For the pig asthma which is currently widespread, the relevant departments in Beijing are vigorously carrying out research and prevention work. Many people's communes have established specialized pig hospitals to isolate and care for them, in order to stop the spread of pig asthma.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, February 12th—Wuning County, Jiangxi Province, is taking early action to carry out spring epidemic prevention work in response to the situation where pig diseases are prone to occur in spring.

    Universally carrying out epidemic prevention injections to enhance the disease resistance of pigs is the first measure taken by the county to prevent pig diseases. As the number of pigs in the county has increased, the county and communes have adopted the methods of running training courses for epidemic prevention personnel separately and establishing animal husbandry and veterinary schools in each larger livestock farm to step up the training of epidemic prevention personnel. All 3,000 feeders in the county will undergo training in batches, and they will publicize the importance of pig epidemic prevention and scientific knowledge to the masses. At present, the first phase of training courses for epidemic prevention personnel run by the county and communes has ended. The communes are inspecting the health of pigs and preparing to start epidemic prevention injections in late February, with all work to be completed by early March.

    The second measure is to strengthen quarantine work to prevent the spread of pig diseases. The 58 quarantine stations in the people's communes have all started operations. All pigs slaughtered, transported out, and traded must undergo strict quarantine procedures.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, February 12th—Jingjiang County, Jiangsu Province, insists on implementing the policy of improving feeding management as the main measure and drug prevention and control as a supplement, and vigorously carries out mass livestock epidemic prevention work. At present, the county has completely eliminated the main pig diseases—swine erysipelas and swine fever.

    In the struggle to eliminate swine fever in this county, all pig-raising professional cadres have gone deep into pig farms to establish disease-free "basic fields." The county party committee often organizes communes and teams to inspect pigpens; vigorously promotes the experience of changing cold pens and hard nests to warm sheds and soft nests in the first and fourth quarters, and changing hot pens to cold pens and feeding pigs with cooked food in the second and third quarters; and organizes commune members to closely combine with the patriotic health campaign to carry out activities of turning over pigpens in every household and whitewashing pigpens (disinfecting with lime water), and last year created a record of no piglet deaths in a year.

    In the work of preventing and controlling pig diseases, Jingjiang County, in addition to adopting the method of combining year-round epidemic prevention with intensive epidemic prevention, has also strengthened market management and port quarantine work. Piglets listed on the market in all parts of the county must be quarantined before being allowed to enter the market for trading. Veterinary stations and veterinary groups have been established in each commune and production brigade, forming a prevention network throughout the county that reports pig epidemics upon seeing them and treats pig diseases immediately upon seeing them. This has eliminated the source of germs.

    The current season is when diseases such as swine fever are prone to occur. The county and communes are holding short-term training courses for the three personnel (feeders, epidemic prevention personnel, and veterinarians), actively training epidemic prevention and feeding personnel, and mobilizing more than 80 veterinarians to make swine fever rabbit immunization vaccine by themselves. Within three days, they rushed to complete the preventive injections for a large number of pigs.

    提早动手　防治猪疫病
    北京郊区开展防疫工作　江西武宁加强检疫工作
    江苏靖江县改善饲养管理消灭猪瘟和猪丹毒
    据新华社12日讯　北京郊区各县和人民公社都提早动手积极组织各方面力量，开展以防治猪病为中心的春季牲畜防疫活动。
    2、3、4月正是猪传染病最易流行的季节。全郊区四百多处兽医院（站）的六百多名兽医，近三千名专职防疫员和最近各县（区）训练的大批兼职防疫人员都投入了猪只注射、预防和治疗工作。截至目前为止，行动较早的房山等三个县（区）注射预防工作已全部结束，其它各县（区）也将在3月上旬以前完成，一般比往年提早一个月左右。
    对于目前流行较广的猪喘病，北京市有关部门正在大力开展研究、防治工作，很多人民公社都建立了专门的猪病院，隔离护理，以制止猪喘病蔓延。
    据新华社南昌12日电　江西武宁县针对春季容易发生猪疫病的情况，提早动手开展春季防疫工作。
    普遍进行防疫注射，增强猪只抗病能力，是这个县防止猪疫病的第一个措施。由于全县生猪数量增多，县、社采取了分别开办防疫人员训练班和在每个较大的畜牧场建立畜牧兽医学校的办法，加紧培训防疫人员。全县三千名饲养员都将经过分批轮训，并通过他们向广大群众宣传生猪防疫的重要性和科学知识。现在，县、社办的第一期防疫人员训练班已经结束，各公社正在检查生猪的健康情况，准备2月下旬开始防疫注射，3月初全部结束。
    第二个措施是加强检疫工作，防止猪疫病传染。各人民公社的五十八个检疫站都已开始活动。所有宰杀、外运和买卖流动的生猪都必须经过严格的检疫手续。
    据新华社南京12日电　江苏省靖江县坚持贯彻以改善饲养管理为主，药物防治为辅的方针，大力开展群众性牲畜防疫工作。目前，全县已彻底消灭了猪的主要疫病——猪丹毒和猪瘟。
    这个县在消灭猪瘟的斗争中，所有养猪专业干部都深入猪场建立了无疫病的“基本田”。县委经常组织社、队互查猪圈；大力推广一四季度改冷圈硬窝为热栏软窝，二三季度把热圈改为冷圈以及熟食喂猪的经验；组织社员紧密结合爱国卫生运动，开展家家翻圈堂，户户粉刷猪圈（用石灰水消毒）的活动，去年曾经创造了一年无猪仔死亡的纪录。
    靖江县在防治生猪疫病的工作中，除了采取常年防疫与突击防疫相结合的方法外，还加强了市场管理和港口检疫工作。全县各地上市的苗猪都经过先检疫、然后才准入市场交易。各公社和生产大队都建立了兽医站和兽医组，使全县形成一个见猪疫就报、见猪病即治的预防网。杜绝了病菌的来源。
    当前正是猪瘟等病易于发生的季节，县和公社一面举办三员（饲养员、防疫员、兽医）短期训练班，积极培训防疫、饲养人员，一面动员八十多个兽医，自制猪瘟兔化疫苗，在三天时间内，突击完成了大批猪只的预防注射任务。
