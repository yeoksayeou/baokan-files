    Welcome These Two Columns
    I think the "Concern for Our Common Cause" letters column published on page 2 of the People's Daily on February 8th is very good. I hope that such a column will be opened regularly in the future, so that everyone can care about the collective cause and put forward opinions on improving the work.

    The "Advanced Science and Technology of Fraternal Countries" column on the international page of the People's Daily not only increases people's knowledge, but also uses facts to illustrate the rapid development of science and technology in socialist countries, demonstrating the superiority of the socialist system. I hope it becomes a regular column and is published periodically.

    欢迎这两个专栏
    2月8日人民日报二版上登出的“关心我们共同的事业”的来信专栏，我认为很好。希望以后经常辟这样一栏，让大家都来关心集体的事业，提出改进工作的意见。

    人民日报国际版上“兄弟国家的先进科学技术”一栏，不但可以使人增长知识，而且用事实说明了社会主义国家科学技术的迅速发展，显示出社会主义制度的优越性。希望它成为一个固定的栏目，定期刊载。		　马荫楷
