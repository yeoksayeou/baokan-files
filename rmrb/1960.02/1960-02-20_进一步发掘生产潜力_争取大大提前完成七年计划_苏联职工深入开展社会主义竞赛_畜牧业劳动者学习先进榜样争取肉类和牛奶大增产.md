Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th. Correspondent Li Nan reports: Since the beginning of spring this year, industrial enterprises in various parts of the Soviet Union have further launched in-depth socialist emulation drives to strive to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule, further tap production potential, increase product quantity, and improve quality.

This year, a feature of the socialist emulation is that industrial enterprises in various regions have put forward higher production guarantees. For example, the Sverdlovsk Economic Region, which first initiated the competition to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule last year, has put forward even higher competition conditions this year. The economic region originally planned to reach the industrial production level stipulated in the 1965 Seven-Year Plan a year ahead of schedule last year, but now it has decided to advance it by another six months. The production of important products such as iron, steel, and rolled steel will be achieved three years ahead of schedule, that is, in 1962, the targets of the Seven-Year Plan will be met. The Seven-Year Plan target for improving labor productivity in industrial enterprises throughout the economic region will also be completed two years ahead of schedule. Industrial enterprises in Leningrad and the Leningrad region had guaranteed in the third quarter of last year that they would complete the Seven-Year Plan for improving labor productivity two years ahead of schedule. This year, they have further guaranteed that they will reach the 1965 level of total industrial output value stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan two years ahead of schedule.

At present, various economic regions in the Soviet Union are responding to the initiatives of the above-mentioned regions and are enthusiastically launching a competition movement between economic regions.

This year, industrial enterprises in various regions have focused their competition goals on the main methods of tapping production potential, that is, striving for technological progress and innovating existing production equipment. After a mass review this year, Moscow has decided to stop producing 1,000 kinds of outdated machines and produce newly designed machines. Workers at the "October Revolution" Locomotive Factory in Lugansk Oblast decided to modernize 300 train locomotives produced by the factory, which are currently used on various railway lines, this year to increase the speed of the locomotives and save a lot of fuel. The Leningrad Hardware Factory decided to modernize 21 steam turbine machines produced by the factory, which will save the country fuel worth 11.5 million rubles each year. Industrial enterprises in various regions are also striving to produce and install more automated production lines and new machines. Leningrad and the Leningrad region have decided to rapidly build nearly 400 automated production lines starting this year, automating the production of three factories and more than 250 workshops and work sections.

A noteworthy situation in the competition plans put forward by various regions this year is that the steel and various machinery and equipment produced beyond the plan this year will be produced using materials and raw materials saved by the factories themselves, and no additional raw materials and materials will be requested from the state.

Reducing production costs, practicing strict economy, and improving product quality are still important goals of the Soviet workers' production competition this year. Moscow workers have put forward many initiatives in this regard that have attracted national attention. For example, female worker Petrisheva from the Frunze Factory proposed that every worker should make their own contribution to reducing costs. She guaranteed that this year she would save the country 8,718 rubles from cost reductions in her position, which means that it can directly link the savings plan of the entire factory and enterprise with each producer. Now, the Moscow Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has required industrial enterprises throughout the city to promote this initiative.

Xinhua News Agency, 19th. Soviet livestock production workers are learning from advanced role models and carrying out the competition of one person raising a thousand pigs and feeding a hundred cows to welcome this year's large increase in meat and milk production and rapidly complete the Seven-Year Plan for livestock production.

This competition was launched after the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union introduced the experiences of Chiti, an advanced pig breeder in Ukraine, Bartulis in Latvia, and Sisoyeva in the Moscow region, who raised 100 cows per person, at the December plenary session. Prior to this, the number of pigs and cows raised by one person had never been so high, and raising 300 or 400 pigs was considered the limit. These advanced producers used simple mechanization methods and advanced feeding methods to multiply the number of feedings and greatly increased meat production.

These concrete examples educated people. Sazanova of the "Spark" Collective Farm in the Gorky region raised 500 pigs last year. At the end of the year, she proposed that she would raise 1,000 pigs per person in 1960. At the time, many people did not believe she could do it. A few days later, when she read Chiti's speech at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, she became even more confident and decided to increase the number of feedings. Chadaeva, a pig farmer at the "Petrel" State Farm in the same region, is also preparing to raise 1,000 pigs and hand over 60 tons of pork to the state this year. She said: "I think I will surpass Chiti soon. Let us compete." Vozantsova, a pig farmer at the Mukhinsk State Farm in the Kirov region, raised 800 pigs last year and won the first place in the state. This year, she decided to raise 1,500 pigs per person. Tikhonova, a skilled pig farmer at the "White Villa" State Farm in the Moscow region, raised 500 pigs per person last year. This year, she decided to raise 2,000 pigs per person, hand over 2,200 quintals of pork to the state, and challenge Chiti with this. Sapozhnikov, the captain of the comprehensive work team of the "New Road" Collective Farm in the Smolensk region, decided to do pig raising work after reading the materials of the December plenary session. The goal he proposed was to raise 1,000 pigs this year and hand over 850 quintals of pork to the state.

In terms of cattle raising, Sisoyeva, a feeder at the "Twentieth Party Congress" Collective Farm in the Moscow region, created an advanced method of raising 100 cows per person. This year, she decided to increase it to 150. Chiupliskaia, a famous cattle breeder in Latvia, will start raising 146 cows per person this year, more than twice the original quota. She milks twice a day. Due to the implementation of mechanization and the improvement of working methods, each milking takes only about two hours. She decided to produce 500,000 kilograms of milk from the cows she feeds this year.

These advanced competitors use mechanization and advanced feeding methods not only to increase the number of feedings, but also to greatly reduce costs. Some advanced pig raising experts in the Dnepropetrovsk region already raised 1,000 pigs last year, and the cost of 100 kilograms of pork was 240 rubles. This year, the number of feedings per person will increase to 2,000, and the cost per 100 kilograms will be reduced to 220 rubles. Volkontlub, a pig farmer at the Stalin State Farm in Vinnitsa, Ukraine, in addition to learning from Chiti's example to increase the number of pigs raised, also decided to reduce the cost of 100 kilograms of pork from 425 rubles last year to 300 rubles.

Bukhovsky and Kusi, advanced feeders at the Sixth State Farm in the Stalin region, decided to raise 1,250 pigs each this year. In order to achieve this goal, the farm built pigsties, which were equipped with automatic troughs and automatic drinkers, and improved the configuration and supply methods of feed.

The advanced experience and competition of these advanced producers have received attention and support from party organizations in various regions.

    新华社莫斯科18日电　本社记者李楠报道：今年开春以来，苏联各地工业企业进一步深入地展开社会主义竞赛，争取大大提前完成七年计划，进一步发掘生产潜力，增加产品数量并提高质量。
    今年，社会主义竞赛的一个特色是：各地工业企业都提出了更高的生产保证。例如，去年曾首先发起提前完成七年计划竞赛的斯维德洛夫斯克经济区，在今年又提出了比去年更高的竞赛条件。这个经济区去年原计划提前一年达到七年计划规定的1965年的工业生产水平，现在决定再提早半年。其中，铁、钢和轧钢等重要产品的生产，要提前三年，即在1962年就达到七年计划的指标。全经济区工业企业提高劳动生产率的七年计划指标也将提前两年完成。列宁格勒市和列宁格勒州各工业企业在去年第三季度曾经保证，要提前两年完成提高劳动生产率的七年计划。今年，它们又进一步保证，要提前两年达到七年计划规定的1965年工业总产值水平。
    目前，苏联各经济区正在响应上述地区的倡议，热火朝天地展开经济区和经济区之间的竞赛运动。
    今年，各地工业企业都把竞赛目标集中在发掘生产潜力的主要方法，也就是争取技术进步和革新现有生产设备上面。莫斯科市今年经过群众性的审查后，已决定停止生产一千种过时了的机器，而生产新设计的机器。卢干斯克州“十月革命”机车工厂职工决定，要在今年把本厂生产的、现为各铁路线所使用的三百台火车机车加以现代化，以提高机车的行车速度，并节约大量燃料。列宁格勒五金工厂决定将工厂所生产的二十一部蒸汽透平机现代化，这样，每年就将为国家节约价值一千一百五十万卢布的燃料。各地工业企业还力争生产和安装更多的自动化作业线和新式机器。列宁格勒市和列宁格勒州已决定从今年起将迅速建成近四百条自动化作业线，使三个工厂以及二百五十多个车间和工段的生产自动化。
    在各地提出的今年的竞赛计划中，一个值得注意的情况是：今年超计划生产的钢铁和各种机器设备，都要用各个工厂自己节约的材料和原料来生产，而不另外向国家要原料和材料。
    降低生产成本、厉行节约、提高产品质量，仍然是苏联工人今年生产竞赛的一个重要目标。莫斯科的工人在这方面提出了不少引起全国注意的倡议。例如，伏龙芝工厂的女工彼特里谢娃倡议，每个工人都应在降低成本中作出自己的贡献。她保证今年要在自己的工作岗位上，一个人从降低成本中为国家节约八千七百一十八卢布，这一倡议的意义在于，它能够使整个工厂企业的节约计划同每个生产者直接联系起来。现在，苏联共产党莫斯科市委会已要求全市工业企业推广这一倡议。
    据新华社19日讯　苏联畜牧业生产劳动者学习先进榜样，开展一人养猪千头喂牛百头竞赛，来迎接今年的肉类和牛奶大增产，迅速完成畜牧业生产的七年计划。
    这一竞赛是苏联共产党中央委员会12月全会介绍了乌克兰先进养猪能手契季、拉脱维亚巴尔图利斯和莫斯科州一人养牛一百头的西索耶娃的经验后开展起来的。在这以前，一个人饲养的猪和牛的头数从来没有这样多，养猪三、四百头已经被认为是极限了。这些先进生产者用简易机械化方法，用先进的饲养方法成倍地增加了喂养数量，大大提高了肉类生产。
    这些具体的事例教育了人们。高尔基州“火花”集体农庄萨赞诺娃去年养猪五百头，在年底她提出1960年一人养猪一千头。当时许多人都不相信她办得到。不几天，当她读到契季在苏共中央全会上的讲话后，她更增加了信心，决定还要增多喂养头数。这个州“海燕”国营农场养猪员查达耶娃也准备养猪千头，今年上交国家六十吨猪肉。她说：“我想不久就会超过契季。让我们较量较量罢。”基洛夫州穆欣斯克国营农场养猪员沃赞索娃去年养猪八百头，获得全州第一名。今年她决定一人养猪一千五百头。莫斯科州“白色别墅”国营农场养猪能手吉洪诺娃去年一人养猪五百头。今年她决定一人养猪两千头，上交国家二千二百公担猪肉，并且以此向契季提出挑战。斯摩棱斯克州“新路”集体农庄综合工作队队长萨波日尼科夫在读了十二月全会的材料后，决定去做养猪工作，他提出的目标是今年养猪一千头，交给国家八百五十公担猪肉。
    在养牛方面，莫斯科州“第二十次党代表大会”集体农庄饲养员西索耶娃创造了一人养牛一百头的先进方法，今年她决定增加到一百五十头。拉脱维亚著名的养牛员丘普利斯卡娅从今年起开始一人养牛一百四十六头，超过原定额两倍。她一天挤两次奶。由于实行了机械化及改进了工作方法，她每次挤奶时间大约只要两小时。她决定今年要从她喂养的牛身上产奶五十万公斤。
    这些先进的竞赛者都利用机械化和先进饲养方法不仅要多增加喂养头数，并且还要大力降低成本。第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克州一些先进养猪能手去年已做到养猪千头，每百公担猪肉成本为二百四十卢布，今年他们每人的喂养头数将增加到二千头，每百公担成本将减至二百二十卢布。乌克兰文尼萨州斯大林国营农场养猪员沃尔康特卢伯除学习契季的榜样增加养猪头数外，还决定要把每百公担猪肉的成本从去年的四百二十五卢布降低到三百卢布。
    斯大林诺州第六国营农场的先进饲养员布洪夫斯基和库西二人今年决定每人养猪一千二百五十头。为了达到这一目标，农场修建了猪舍，其中装置了自动秣槽和自动饮水器，改进了饲料的配置和供应方法。
    这些先进生产者的先进经验和竞赛受到各地党组织的重视和支持。
