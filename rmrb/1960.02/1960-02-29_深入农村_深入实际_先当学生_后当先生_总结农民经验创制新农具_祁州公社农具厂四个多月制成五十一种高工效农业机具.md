    Summarize Farmers' Experiences and Create New Farm Tools
    Qizhou Commune Farm Tool Factory Produces 51 Kinds of High-Efficiency Agricultural Machines in Just Over Four Months
    
    (Our Tianjin Dispatch, February 28th, Reporter Fang Chen) In supporting agricultural technical transformation, the workers of the Qizhou People's Commune Farm Tool Manufacturing and Repair Factory in Anguo County, Hebei Province, have adopted the method of "first being a student, then being a teacher." They have gone deep into production teams and fields to summarize farmers' tool reform experiences, comprehensively improve them, and match them into sets to manufacture agricultural machinery suitable for local farming conditions. At the same time, they have promoted the development of the commune's farm tool reform movement from individual, single-item farm tool improvements to mechanization and semi-mechanization.

    In order to produce more high-efficiency agricultural machines that meet the requirements of intensive cultivation, this factory, starting in the fourth quarter of last year, under the leadership of the Party Branch Secretary, absorbed eleven technicians to participate in the formation of a Technical Research Committee and a Farm Tool Reform Research Group. They went deep into the production teams to understand the needs of agricultural production and determine the projects for new agricultural machines. Then, through surveys, interviews, discussions with experienced farmers, on-site observations, and the organization of mobile farm tool repair teams, they quickly collected the scattered farm tool improvement experiences of various production teams, classified and sorted them, researched and improved them into sets, and manufactured mechanized and semi-mechanized agricultural machines. In this way, scattered farm tool innovations were transformed into complete sets of agricultural machinery, and single-item farm tool improvements were transformed into joint machinery. The cultivated land of Qizhou Commune has generally implemented advanced gardening, requiring each piece of land to be as flat as a mirror and the ridges as straight as a line. This requires the tilled land to be built into ridges after five processes, and a strong laborer can only cultivate three or four fen of land per day at most. The commune members suggested: "We use 'iron oxen' for plowing and boiler-powered pumps for watering, but building ridges makes people's backs ache and legs hurt." Liu Kuishan and Qi Bingxuan, workers at this factory, went deep into the production teams to systematically study more than 20 kinds of improved land leveling and ridge building tools. After four experiments and modifications, they created a combined land leveling and ridge building machine that completes the five production processes of rolling, harrowing, leveling, shaping, and ridge building in one operation. Two animal-powered machines with one person can level and build ridges on 40 mu of land per day, equivalent to the workload of more than 130 laborers and five animals in the past. This year, the whole commune is using tractors to plow the land, multi-row seeders pulled by tractors and horses for sowing, cultivators for weeding, and all manure is transported by rubber-wheeled vehicles, but the process of digging manure and loading it onto the vehicles is still done manually with iron forks. The commune members have to dig hundreds of carts of manure from manure pits more than five feet deep with forks, and then load them onto the vehicles and transport them to the fields, which is slow and tiring. The commune members reflected: "The manure in the pits can't be dug out, so even if rubber-wheeled vehicles and tractors are fast, they can't be used to their full potential." In response to the needs of the commune members, the factory held forums with skilled craftsmen and experienced farmers in various production teams, studied old manure forks, carrying poles, and other manure digging tools, and with reference to the principle of excavators, trial-produced a hand-cranked manure digging machine. Two people can operate it and load a large cart in five minutes, increasing efficiency by more than two times compared to manual manure digging. The commune members can dig the manure out of the pits and load it onto the vehicles without having to go down into the pits, greatly reducing labor intensity. In this way, from October of last year to now, in just over four months, this factory has trial-produced 51 types and more than 15,000 pieces (sets) of new high-efficiency agricultural machines suitable for local farming conditions. These include not only mechanized rolling, harrowing, leveling, and ridge building combined machines, universal feed crushers, dryers, and other large-scale agricultural machinery, but also semi-mechanized manure digging machines, universal seeders, cultivators, and complete sets of high-efficiency machines for field management, livestock breeding, and canteen cooking.

    In this way, the new machines have not only powerfully supported agriculture, but also promoted the rapid development of the mass farm tool reform movement in rural areas to a newer stage. By holding on-site meetings, they regularly gathered skilled craftsmen from various production teams to teach the manufacturing methods of new agricultural machines and comprehensively promote manufacturing. Some components that the production teams could not manufacture were manufactured and supplied by the manufacturing and repair factory. In this way, the repair teams of the production teams were able to improve from simply repairing and improving some small-scale farm tools in the past to being able to manufacture some complete sets of simple agricultural machinery. As of mid-February, in four and a half months, this factory promoted more than 20 kinds of complete sets of agricultural machinery for agricultural cultivation, livestock breeding, and cooking, basically realizing the mechanization and semi-mechanization of production processes such as harrowing, leveling land, building ridges, sowing, and cultivating in the whole commune. Field transportation was realized with rubber-wheeled vehicles, and labor production efficiency was doubled.

    The Qizhou People's Commune Farm Tool Manufacturing and Repair Factory, by adopting various methods to support agricultural technical transformation, has further strengthened the relationship between workers and farmers. The commune members also support the factory in terms of manpower and materials. Recently, each production team has drawn out 30 capable and energetic young men to support the expansion of the factory. (Attached picture)

    深入农村　深入实际　先当学生　后当先生
    总结农民经验创制新农具
    祁州公社农具厂四个多月制成五十一种高工效农业机具
    本报天津28日电　记者方辰报道：河北省安国县祁州人民公社农具制造修配厂职工，在支援农业技术改造中，采取“先当学生，后当先生”的办法，深入到生产队、田间总结农民工具改革经验，综合提高，搭配成套，制造出适合当地耕作条件的农业机具，同时又促使全社农具改革运动由个别的单项农具改良向机械化半机械化方向发展。
    这个厂为了生产出更多的适应精耕细作要求的高工效的农业机具，从去年第四季度开始，由党支部书记挂帅，吸收十一名技术工人参加，组成技术研究委员会和农具改革研究小组，深入到各生产队了解农业生产需要，确定新制农业机具的项目。然后，再通过调查访问、老农座谈、现场观摩和组织巡回修配农具小组等形式，将各生产队零星的农具改良经验，迅速集中起来加以分类排队，研究改进搭配成套，制造机械化半机械化的农业机具。这样，就把零星的农具革新变为成套的农业机具，把单项的农具改良变为联合机械。祁州公社的耕地普遍实行了高级园田化，每一块地都要求作到地平如镜，埂直如线。这就需要把耕过的地，再经过五道工序筑成畦，一个壮劳动力最多一天只能打整三、四分地。社员们提出：耕地用“铁牛”，浇地有锅驼机，就是培畦埂弄的人们腰酸腿痛。这个厂的工人刘奎山和齐炳轩就深入到生产队系统地研究了二十多种经过改良的平整土地和培埂工具，先后经过四次试验修改，创造出一种联合平地筑畦机，使轧地、耙地、平、整、筑畦五道生产工序一次作完。两个畜力一个人一天平整、筑畦四十亩地，相当于过去的一百三十多个劳动力、五个畜力的工作量。今年全公社耕地有拖拉机，耩地使用机引和马拉的多行播种机，锄地有中耕器，送粪全部胶轮车化，就是起粪、装车还是用人力铁叉。社员们从五尺多深的粪坑里将几百车粪一叉叉的起上来，再装车送到地里，又慢又累。社员们反映：圈粪起不出来，胶轮车、拖拉机再快也施展不开。这个厂针对社员们的要求，到各生产队召开能工巧匠和老农座谈会，研究了旧起粪叉、挑杆等起粪工具，又参考着挖土机的原理，试制出一种手摇起粪机，两个人操作，五分钟就能装一大车，比人工起粪提高效率两倍多，社员们不用下粪坑就把粪起上来装上车，大大减轻了劳动强度。就这样，这个厂从去年10月到现在，四个多月时间，已试制出五十一种、一万五千多件（台）适合当地耕作条件的高工效的新式农业机具。其中不仅有机械化的轧、耙、平整、筑畦联合机，万能饲料粉碎机，烘干机等大型农业机械，还有半机械化的起粪机、万能点播机、中耕器和田间管理、牲畜饲养、食堂炊事等方面成套的高工效机具。
    这样，不仅用新机具有力地支援了农业，同时又促使农村群众性的农具改革运动很快走向一个更新的阶段。他们通过召开现场会议，定期把各生产队的能工巧匠集中在一起，传授新式农业机具的制造方法，全面推广制造，生产队没有条件制造的一些机件，再由制造修配厂负责制造供给。这样就使得生产队的修配小组，由过去只能修配和改良一些零星的小型农具，提高到能制造一些成套的简易农业机具。截至2月中旬，四个半月时间，这个厂推行了二十多种成套的农业耕作、牲畜饲养、炊事等方面的农业机具，使全社耙、平整土地、筑畦、播种、中耕等生产工序和米面加工基本上实现了机械化半机械化，田间运输实现了胶轮车化，劳动生产效率成倍地提高。
    祁州人民公社农具制造修配厂，由于采取各种方式支援农业技术改造，进一步密切了工人与农民的关系。社员们也从人力、物力等方面支援工厂。最近各生产队又抽出三十名精明强干的年轻小伙子，支援工厂扩建。（附图片）
