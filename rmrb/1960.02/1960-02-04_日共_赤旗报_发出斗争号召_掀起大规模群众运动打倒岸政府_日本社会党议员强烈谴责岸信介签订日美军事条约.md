Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd. The Japanese Communist Party's organ "Red Flag" published an editorial today, calling on all members to develop the struggle against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" into a large-scale struggle to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government and demand the dissolution of the Diet, based on the decisions of the Party Central Committee's Eighth Plenary Session.
    The editorial emphasized the need to combine the people's struggle to defend their lives with the struggle against the ratification of the "Security Treaty." It stated that if these struggles are closely linked, there will be a surge in large-scale mass movements, the strength of which will be sufficient to overwhelm the ruling party's majority in the Diet, and overwhelm those newspapers and radio stations that are conducting propaganda to force the ruling party to pass the new "Security Treaty" in the Diet.
    The editorial then stated that in order to realize this possibility, all party members need to cooperate with the Japanese Socialist Party and trade unions and actively participate in all joint struggle organizations.
    Turning to the newly established Democratic Socialist Party, the editorial appealed to the party's Diet members: if they truly oppose the ratification of the new treaty, they should not take actions that undermine the joint actions of democratic parties in the Diet.
    The editorial also called on all people to participate in the united struggle in the Diet against the ruling party.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd. The Japanese "Red Flag" newspaper today, in a commentary on the policy speeches of Japanese Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke and Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama, pointed out that their speeches were "aimed at deceiving the people and challenging the trend of easing global tensions."
    The newspaper said: "At a time when breaking the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations has become Japan's most important diplomatic task, Kishi Nobusuke made no mention of his China policy, which proves that he lacks confidence and is completely incapable of this task."
    The newspaper said, referring to Fujiyama's attack on the Soviet Union's memorandum to the Japanese government on January 27 regarding the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," that it is impossible to improve relations between Japan and the Soviet Union as long as the Foreign Minister makes such provocative remarks.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd. Japanese Socialist Party member Hanyu Sanae today strongly condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government for signing a U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty in the House of Councillors and demanded the dissolution of the Diet.
    While questioning Kishi Nobusuke and other government officials on their policy speeches, Hanyu Sanae pointed out that the new "Security Treaty" signed by the Kishi Nobusuke government with the United States runs counter to the general trend of the world. He said that the treaty violates the Japanese constitution and creates serious obstacles to establishing normal diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union.
    The Socialist Party member also pointed out that Japan should not conclude specific military alliances with any country in the East or West. He demanded that Japan follow a neutral path.
    Hanyu Sanae also said, "Japan should not wait for the international situation to evolve, but should actively and proactively pursue an independent policy towards China. If there is no such policy, Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke should resign immediately."
    The councilor also exposed the deceptive nature of the so-called "prior consultation" with Japan regarding changes in the equipment and deployment of U.S. forces stationed in Japan or dispatching them to fight in Japan, in the exchange of notes for the new "Security Treaty." He said that Japan does not have a veto.
    Hanyu demanded that the government urge the United States to return the Japanese territory of Okinawa Island to Japan. He questioned Kishi Nobusuke as to whether he intended to conclude a peace treaty and non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, and demanded that Kishi Nobusuke explain his attitude toward comprehensive disarmament and how he would handle the Japanese army.
    Hanyu Sanae also revealed that the Kishi Nobusuke government's basic guidelines for formulating the national budget for this year were centered on increasing military spending and seeking profits for big capitalists. It is an irresponsible budget. He pointed out that in fiscal year 1960, the taxes borne by the Japanese people will increase. He demanded that military spending be reduced and that this expenditure be used to stabilize people's lives.
    In answering the question, Kishi Nobusuke continued to clamor for "strengthening the solidarity of the free camp." He concealed the aggressive nature of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and insisted that the treaty "does not violate the constitution."
    Kishi Nobusuke, who is keen on developing Japan's military strength, expressed a negative attitude toward disarmament. He avoided answering the question of whether he intended to reduce the Japanese army.
    Kishi Nobusuke slandered the Soviet Union's memorandum condemning the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" as endangering the Soviet Union, China, and countries in the Far East and Pacific region, and expressed his unwillingness to sign a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. He reiterated that he did not want to dissolve the House of Representatives and would remain in the position of Prime Minister, "not considering resignation."
    Japanese Socialist Party Secretary-General Asanuma Inejiro issued a statement on the 1st criticizing Kishi Nobusuke's policy speech. He pointed out that the revision of the "Security Treaty" marks the militarization of Japan.

    日共“赤旗报”发出斗争号召
    掀起大规模群众运动打倒岸政府
    日本社会党议员强烈谴责岸信介签订日美军事条约
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，号召全体党员根据党中央第八次全会的决定，把反对批准新“安全条约”的斗争发展成为推翻岸信介政府和要求解散国会的大规模斗争。
    社论强调有必要把人民保卫生活的斗争同反对批准“安全条约”的斗争结合起来。它说，如果把这些斗争紧密地结合在一起，那么将会出现大规模的群众运动的高涨，这种高涨的力量足以压倒执政党在国会中所占的多数，并且压倒那些为使执政党在国会中强行通过新“安全条约”而进行宣传活动的报纸和电台。
    社论接着说，为了实现这种可能性，一切党员有必要同日本社会党和工会合作，积极参加一切共同斗争组织。
    社论在谈到新成立的民主社会党时，向这个党的国会议员呼吁：如果他们真正反对批准新条约的话，他们就不要采取破坏民主党派在国会中的联合行动的做法。
    社论还号召所有的人民参加在国会中反对执政党的联合斗争。
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本“赤旗报”今天在一篇评论日本首相岸信介和外务相藤山爱一郎的施政演说的文章中指出，他们的演说是“旨在欺骗人民和向世界紧张局势和缓的趋势提出挑战的演说”。
    报纸说：“在打破日中关系僵局问题成为日本最重要的外交任务时，岸信介却只字不提他的对华政策，这证明，他是没有信心，也是完全不能胜任这个任务的。”
    报纸在谈到藤山攻击苏联就新日美“安全条约”在1月27日给日本政府的备忘录时说，只要外务相讲这种挑衅性的话，就不可能改善日苏两国的关系。
    据新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本社会党议员羽生三七今天在参议院强烈谴责岸信介政府同美国签订日美军事同盟条约，并且要求解散国会。
    羽生三七在就岸信介等政府官员的施政演说提出质询时指出，岸信介政府同美国签订的新“安全条约”是同世界大势背道而驰的。他说，这项条约是违反日本宪法的，而且在同中国和苏联建立正常外交关系方面造成了严重的障碍。
    这位社会党议员还指出，日本不应该同东西方的任何国家缔结特定的军事同盟。他要求日本走中立的道路。
    羽生三七还说，“日本不应该等待国际形势如何演变，而应该主动地、积极地奉行独立的对中国的政策。如果没有这种政策，岸信介首相应该马上辞职”。
    这位议员还揭露了新“安全条约”换文中所谓驻日美军的装备、部署有变动或派出日本作战时要同日本“事先协商”的欺骗性。他说，日本并没有否决权。
    羽生要求政府敦促美国把日本领土冲绳岛归还日本。他质问岸信介是否想同苏联缔结和约和互不侵犯条约，并且要求岸信介说明对全面裁军的态度和怎样处理日本的军队。
    羽生三七还揭露岸信介政府制订的本年度国家预算的基本方针是以增加军费和为大资本家谋利为核心的。它是一个不负责任的预算。他指出，1960年度，日本国民担负的捐税将会加重。他要求削减军费，并把这笔开支用来稳定人民生活。
    岸信介在答复质询时继续叫嚷“加强自由阵营的团结”。他掩饰日美军事同盟条约的侵略本质，并且硬说这个条约“不违反宪法”。
    热中于发展日本军事力量的岸信介对裁军表示消极。他避而不答是否打算裁减日本军队的问题。
    岸信介诬蔑苏联谴责日美新“安全条约”危害苏中及远东太平洋地区国家的备忘录，并且表示不愿同苏联签订互不侵犯条约。他再次表示他不想解散众议院，而且要赖在首相的职位上，“不考虑辞职。”
    日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎曾经在1日发表谈话，指责岸信介的施政演说。他指出，修改“安全条约”标志着日本的军国主义化。
