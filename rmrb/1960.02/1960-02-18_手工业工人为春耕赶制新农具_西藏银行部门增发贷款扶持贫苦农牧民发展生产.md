Xinhua News Agency, February 17th - Since the beginning of spring, handicraft workers in iron, wood, bamboo, and other industries in various regions have been working tirelessly, day and night, to produce, repair, and reform various farm tools to welcome this year's spring plowing and sowing season.

    In Hunan Province, handicraft workers serving spring plowing have gone deep into the countryside, establishing more than 29,000 temporary factories and fixed repair stations, and 18,000 mobile service teams. In the past month, the manufactured and repaired farm tools and implements, calculated according to the province's agricultural labor force, average 2.6 pieces per person. In Zhejiang Province, iron, wood, and bamboo handicraft workers have been rushing to produce farm tools for the people's communes. As of early February, they had manufactured more than 7.8 million pieces of paddy plows, deep plows, rice transplanters, and various small farm tools, of which more than 2 million were new and improved farm tools. In Hebei Province's Baoding Special District, more than 5,000 farm tool manufacturing and repair teams have been organized, and all farm tools for sowing early-maturing crops have been manufactured and repaired.

    To adapt to the needs of gradual agricultural mechanization, handicraft departments in many regions have paid special attention to the manufacturing and promotion of new and improved farm tools this year. As of January 20th, Jiangsu Province had manufactured nearly 200,000 pieces of various new farm tools, completing 35% of the first quarter's plan. These include not only single improved farm tools such as rice transplanters and deep plows, but also complete sets of new and improved farm tools manufactured according to agricultural tasks and processes. In Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province, 13 sets of 84 types of new farm tools for accumulating manure, transporting manure, cultivating land, and transplanting rice, which were finalized through mass appraisal, have now been produced and promoted in more than 1.26 million pieces, enabling the county to use complete sets of new tools for processes such as accumulating manure, transporting manure, applying fertilizer, sowing, transplanting, plowing, and harrowing. In Yuechi County, Sichuan Province, handicraft workers are determined to help the rural areas ensure that all farm tools needed for the harvesting of spring crops and the planting of summer crops are improved and semi-mechanized farm tools. They have already produced 25 new farm tools, such as seedling flatteners, rapid harvesters, rice transplanters, and improved waterwheels, totaling more than 100,000 pieces.

    In the process of manufacturing and promoting new farm tools, many handicraft factories and cooperatives have sent workers to consult with elderly farmers, and some have joined forces with the commune's improved farm tool research groups to continuously improve technology, so that some improved farm tools are more suitable for the characteristics of local crops and soil. The water and dry land dual-purpose deep plow reformed by the Xuguang Farm Tool Factory in Echeng County, Hubei Province, after repeatedly soliciting opinions from the masses and continuously improving it, was unanimously considered at the county's spring plowing farm tool reform on-site meeting to have many advantages such as being lightweight, sturdy, simple in structure, saving materials, low in price, and easy to promote, and was warmly welcomed by commune members.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, February 17th - The People's Bank of China's Tibet Branch has begun to issue low-interest agricultural and pastoral loans to poor farmers and herdsmen in Tibet to help them develop production. The total amount of agricultural and pastoral loans issued this year is more than three times that of last year, and more than double the total amount of loans issued in Tibet in the past.

    The emancipated Tibetan farmers have an unprecedented enthusiasm for production this year and are actively preparing for spring plowing. In order to meet and support the requirements of Tibetan farmers and herdsmen for developing production, the People's Bank has increased the types of loans this year. In addition to lending seeds, it will also help farmers and herdsmen purchase farm tools, build water conservancy projects, and increase livestock protection equipment through loans.

    While issuing agricultural and pastoral loans, the People's Bank also provides loans to support handicraft production in Tibet. The amount of handicraft loans this year is more than ten times that of last year.

    手工业工人为春耕赶制新农具
    西藏银行部门增发贷款扶持贫苦农牧民发展生产
    据新华社17日讯　入春以来，各地铁、木、竹等行业的手工业工人干劲冲天，夜以继日地赶制、赶修和改革各种农具，迎接今年的春耕、春播。
    湖南省为春耕生产服务的手工业工人深入农村，建立临时工厂和固定修配站二万九千多个，流动服务组一万八千个，一个月来制造和修理的各种农具、工具，按全省农业劳动力计算，平均每人可得二点六件。浙江省铁、木、竹手工业工人为人民公社赶制农具，截至2月初，已制造出水田犁、深耕犁、插秧机以及各种小农具共七百八十多万件，其中有二百多万件是新式农具和改良农具。河北省保定专区组织五千多个农具制修小组，已制造检修好播种早熟作物的全部农具。
    适应农业逐步机械化的需要，不少地区的手工业部门今年特别注意了新式农具和改良农具的制造和推广工作。江苏省截至1月20日已制造各种新式农具近二十万件，完成第一季度计划的35％。这里面不仅有插秧机、深耕犁等单项改良农具，而且有按农业的工种、工序制造的成套的新式农具和改良农具。浙江嘉兴县通过群众性评比定型的积肥、运肥、耕田、插秧等十三套八十四种新农具，目前已经生产和推广了一百二十六万多件，使全县积肥、运肥、施肥和播、插、耕、耙等工序都能使用上成套新工具。四川省岳池县手工业工人决心帮助农村做到小春收割、大春栽插需用的农具全部是改良农具和半机械化农具，目前已经生产了平秧器、快速收割机、栽秧机、改良水车等新农具二十五种，共十万多件。
    在制造和推广新式农具的过程中，不少手工业厂、社派出工人向老年农民请教，有的和公社的改良农具研究小组结合在一起，不断改进技术，使一些改良农具更能适合当地农作物和土壤的特点。湖北省鄂城县旭光农具厂改制的水旱两用深耕犁，经过反复征求群众意见不断改进后，在全县的春耕农具改革现场会议上被一致认为具有体轻、坚固、构造简单、用材节省、价格低廉、易于推广等许多优点，受到公社社员们的热烈欢迎。
    新华社拉萨17日电　中国人民银行西藏分行今年已开始向西藏各地贫苦农牧民发放低利农牧业贷款，帮助他们发展生产。今年发放农牧业贷款的总数相当于去年的三倍多，比西藏历年来发放贷款的总和还多一倍。
    翻了身的藏族农民今年生产热情空前高涨，正在积极进行春耕前的准备工作。人民银行为了满足和支持西藏农牧民发展生产的要求，今年增加了贷款的种类，除贷放种子外，还将通过贷款帮助农牧民添置农具、兴修水利和增加牲畜保护设备等。
    在发放农牧业贷款的同时，人民银行还贷款扶持西藏的手工业生产。今年的手工业贷款数量比去年增加了十多倍。
