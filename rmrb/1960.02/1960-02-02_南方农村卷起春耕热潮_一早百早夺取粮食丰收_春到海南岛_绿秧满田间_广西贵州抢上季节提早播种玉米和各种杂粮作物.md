Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 1st: While the northern part of our motherland is still covered in ice and snow, Hainan Island in the South is already filled with green rice seedlings. By the end of January, the area planted with rice seedlings on the island had reached more than 70% of the original plan. Currently, more than 400,000 laborers are still stepping up their efforts to transplant seedlings, striving to transplant 900,000 mu more than planned.

This year's rice seedling transplantation on Hainan Island is characterized by an early season, fast speed, high enthusiasm among the masses, and good transplanting quality. Wanning and Qionghai counties on the southeast coast have basically completed transplanting and are now continuing to expand the area of transplanted seedlings while carrying out field management, and weeding. Danxian, Dongfang and other areas in the west and northwest, where the solar terms are usually one or two months later than in the southeast, have also generally advanced the transplanting of rice seedlings this year. In the process of transplanting, all localities particularly emphasize quality and reasonable close planting. Most paddy fields adopt the "three-seven-five" specification, reaching 250,000 seedlings per mu, and a small number of experimental fields have 350,000 seedlings per mu. Generally, about 80 dan of high-quality base fertilizer is applied per mu of field. Haikou, Qiongshan, Qionghai, Wanning, Qiongzhong, Ledong and other counties and cities apply more than 100 dan of base fertilizer per mu; deep plowing generally reaches six or seven inches. Thanks to the newly built 13,600 large and small water conservancy projects, irrigation conditions are also better than last year, increasing and improving the irrigated area by more than 900,000 mu.

In the process of transplanting seedlings, leaders at all levels vigorously mobilized and organized the masses to carry out tool reform movements and rice seedling transplanting skill competitions, ensuring that the seedlings are transplanted quickly and well.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, February 1st: People of all ethnic groups in Guangxi are seizing the time to start planting early corn and various miscellaneous grain crops. According to incomplete statistics as of January 22, the area planted with cassava alone is equivalent to 80% of the cassava planting area in 1959.

Early preparation, early action, seizing the time to catch up with the season are prominent features of this year's spring plowing production in Guangxi. As early as December last year, many areas began to prepare for winter plowing and fertilizer accumulation. By the end of last year, Longjin County had completed the plowing of all 400,000 mu of land in the county and had basically accumulated enough fertilizer for spring plowing. After basically completing winter plowing, afforestation, water conservancy construction and other tasks, Du'an Yao Autonomous County organized 170,000 laborers to accumulate fertilizer, deliver manure, and prepare and sow land. As of January 22, the county had prepared more than 235,000 mu of corn land and planted more than 13,000 mu of corn.

While vigorously developing high-yield and high-yield plots, Guangxi is also organizing forces to vigorously reclaim wasteland and expand the corn planting area. More than 3 million mu of wasteland have been reclaimed throughout the region. In the past, Luocheng, Xincheng, Huanjiang and other counties rarely planted cassava. This year, the four counties organized a total of 60,000 people to go to the mountains to reclaim wasteland and plant cassava. Yulin County put forward the slogan of "seeking treasure from barren mountains and seeking grain from slopes and hills." This year, 612,000 mu of cassava have been planted on the newly reclaimed 748,000 mu of land in the county.

The early corn planted in Guangxi can be harvested in April and May. After harvesting the corn, single-season rice can also be planted. Cassava is a high-yield crop that can not only be eaten as food or used as feed, but also as an industrial raw material.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, February 1st: People of all ethnic groups on the Guizhou Plateau are seizing the time to plant early-maturing crops. A vigorous scene of "spring arrives before the cold winter is over, striving for an early start and a full start to achieve a bumper harvest" has appeared in various parts of the province.

In the past, the planting season for early-maturing crops in various parts of Guizhou was generally around Guyu (Grain Rain). Because the planting was late and the crop growing season was short, in the later stage, the crops were often attacked by natural disasters such as mountain winds, rain, diseases, and insects, and the yield of crops was not high. This year, after summarizing the experience of obtaining a bumper harvest by appropriately early sowing in the past, all people's communes in the province regard grasping the season and early sowing as an important link in achieving continuous leaps forward in agriculture this year. After summarizing the experience of obtaining a bumper harvest of early corn by timely early sowing last year, Bijie County has advanced the early corn planting to Dahan (Major Cold) this year.

In order to make early-maturing crops not only planted early, but also planted more and better, various localities have adopted some necessary technical measures and management methods according to the different conditions of fields, soil, fertilizer, varieties, and climate. Sweet potatoes are generally propagated by using warm beds, and corn and potatoes are generally sown with oil cake and manure; warm water soaking is also carried out to promote early germination and emergence of seeds, and some areas adopt the method of raising corn seedlings in nutrient pots.

    南方农村卷起春耕热潮　一早百早夺取粮食丰收
    春到海南岛　绿秧满田间
    广西贵州抢上季节提早播种玉米和各种杂粮作物
    新华社广州1日电　祖国的北方现在还是冰封千里，而南方的海南岛已经是绿秧满田了。到1月底止，全岛插秧面积已达到原计划的70％以上。目前，四十多万劳动大军仍在加紧赶插，争取比计划多插九十万亩。
    今年海南岛插秧的特点是季节早，速度快，群众干劲大，插秧质量好。东南沿海的万宁，琼海两县已经基本插完，目前正在一面继续扩大插秧面积，一面进行田间管理和中耕除草。历来节气比东南部迟一、二个月的西部和西北部的儋县，东方等地区，今年也普遍提前插秧。各地在插秧中特别强调质量和合理密植，大部分稻田都采用三七五规格，每亩达到二十五万苗，小部分试验田则是三十五万苗。一般每亩田施用优质基肥八十担左右，海口、琼山、琼海、万宁、琼中、乐东等县、市每亩施基肥在一百担以上；深耕一般也达到六、七寸。由于新修了一万三千六百多宗大小水利工程，灌溉情况也比去年好，增加及改善灌溉面积九十多万亩。
    各级领导在插秧中，大力发动组织群众开展工具改革运动和插秧能手竞赛，保证了秧苗插得又快又好。
    新华社南宁1日电　广西各族人民抓紧时机，开始种植早玉米和各种杂粮作物。截至1月22日的不完全统计，其中已种植的木薯就相当于1959年木薯种植面积的80％。
    早准备、早动手，争时间抢上季节，是今年广西春耕生产的一个突出特点。早在去年12月间，许多地区就着手进行冬耕和积肥的准备工作，龙津县到去年年底，全县四十万亩土地全部翻土完毕，并基本积足了春耕需用的肥料。都安瑶族自治县在基本结束冬翻、造林、兴修水利等工作后，组织十七万个劳动力积肥、送粪和整地、播种。到1月22日止，全县已整好玉米地二十三万五千多亩，种下了玉米一万三千多亩。
    广西各地一面大搞高额丰产田、丰产片，一面组织力量大力开荒，扩大玉米的种植面积。全区各地已开荒地三百多万亩，罗城、忻城、环江等县过去很少种木薯，今年四个县共组织六万人上山开荒种木薯。玉林县提出“向荒山取宝，向坡岭要粮”的口号。今年已在全县新开垦的七十四万八千多亩土地上种下木薯六十一万二千多亩。
    广西各地种植的早玉米4、5月间即可收摘，收完玉米后还可种单季稻。木薯是一种高产作物，不仅能当粮食吃或作饲料，还是一种工业原料。
    新华社贵阳1日电　贵州高原各族人民抓紧时间大种早熟作物，全省各地出现“寒冬未过春先到，一早百早夺丰收”的蓬勃景象。
    贵州各地过去早熟作物的栽种季节一般都在谷雨前后。因为下种晚，作物生长期短，在后期往往遭到山区风、雨、病、虫等自然灾害的侵袭，庄稼产量不高。今年，全省各人民公社吸取往年适当早播获得丰收的经验，把抓季节、早播种作为实现今年农业继续跃进的重要环节。毕节县在总结了去年适时早播获得早玉米丰收的经验后，今年全县的早玉米又提早到大寒下种。
    为了使早熟作物既种得早，又种得多、种得好，各地根据田土、肥料、品种、气候的不同情况，采取了一些必要的技术措施和管理方法。红薯一般采取温床育苗，玉米、洋芋普遍推广油枯、大粪拌种；并进行温汤浸种，促进种子早发芽、早出土，有的地区玉米采取营养钵育苗的办法。
