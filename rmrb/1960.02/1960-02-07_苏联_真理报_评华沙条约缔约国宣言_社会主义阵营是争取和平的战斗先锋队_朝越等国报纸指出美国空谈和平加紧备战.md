Xinhua News Agency, February 8th: TASS, Moscow - "Pravda" today published an editorial entitled "Great and Noble Goals" on the Warsaw Treaty Member States' Declaration.

The editorial stated that the strong socialist camp, uniting more than one billion people within its ranks, is the long-tested fighting vanguard of humanity in the struggle for peace. The documents from the Warsaw Treaty Political Consultative Committee meeting published in yesterday's "Pravda" once again clearly demonstrate the peace-loving nature of the socialist countries.

The Moscow meeting of the Warsaw Treaty Political Consultative Committee is an important milestone in the struggle of the countries of the socialist family to strengthen peace.

The editorial said that the meeting was conducted in an atmosphere of full mutual understanding and consolidated friendship, and it shows that opinions are unanimous both in the assessment of the international situation and on the specific issues discussed.

The editorial said that all people of goodwill are heartened by the fact that the current balance of power on the international stage guarantees that the strength of peace-loving countries and peace forces greatly exceeds the forces of war. The brilliant victories of the Soviet Union in communist construction, the vigorous economic development of People's China and other socialist countries, their further unity within the unified socialist camp, and a new surge in the initiative of socialist countries in the struggle for peace have become the basis for the improvement of the international situation. The international role of peace-loving countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, which have shaken off colonial and semi-colonial dependence, is further increasing. All this creates favorable conditions for achieving a great and noble goal—obtaining consolidated and lasting peace.

The editorial emphasized that the balance of world power is becoming increasingly favorable to those who advocate a halt to the rocket-nuclear arms race and other arms races, advocate the elimination of the "Cold War," and advocate peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems and ideologies. A situation has now been created in which any attempt by an aggressor country to resort to force to resolve international disputes and embark on the path of war is bound to lead to the immediate and complete destruction of the disruptor of peace.

The editorial said that influential forces in the West are unwilling to consider this increasingly urgent demand of the people of all countries. They continue to stubbornly oppose strengthening peace. The military blocs cobbled together by Western countries maintain large armies and continue to engage in the arms race. West Germany's Bundeswehr is equipped with rocket weapons, and militarist forces in Japan are clearly becoming more active. The declaration emphasizes that no attempt by the supporters of the "Cold War" can change the fact that awareness of the necessity of peaceful coexistence is now becoming the determining factor in the development of international relations.

The editorial said that the main issue in contemporary international life is the issue of disarmament. Peace-loving humanity fully agrees with the Soviet disarmament plan and the practical steps taken by the socialist countries to implement this plan. They are waiting for Western countries to also take such concrete actions.

The editorial continued by saying that in the current international situation, the immediate resolution of the German question is of great importance. The socialist countries have consistently advocated signing a peace treaty with Germany and resolving the West Berlin issue on the basis of turning West Berlin into a free city. The German Democratic Republic—the first German state of workers and peasants—has expressed its complete willingness to do so. However, the government of the Federal Republic of Germany is doing everything possible to oppose this, and it is still fantasizing about revising borders and seeking revenge. These absurd ideas of the Bonn fantasists are doomed to failure.

The editorial said that the Warsaw Treaty is a peace-loving organization. Its proposal to conclude a non-aggression treaty between the Warsaw Treaty Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, these two groups of countries, stems from a desire for peace and friendship. The Warsaw Treaty member states declare that this proposal remains valid, and they are ready to sign a non-aggression treaty with the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization at any time.

The editorial said that the whole world is now closely watching the preparations for a summit meeting. The participants are very pleased that an agreement has been reached on this issue. They believe that issues as important and ripe for discussion as the issue of complete and thorough disarmament, the issue of a peace treaty with Germany including the establishment of a free city of West Berlin, the issue of banning the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and the issue of East-West relations should be discussed at the upcoming summit meeting of heads of government. The participating countries expressed their hope that the heads of government will be able to find the right path to a satisfactory resolution of the above issues.

The editorial concluded by saying that the Warsaw Treaty Member States' Declaration is receiving increasingly broad support from the people of all countries and will produce significant results.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 6th: North Korea's "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial today saying: The meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty Member States is a great demonstration of the peace-loving foreign policy consistently adhered to by the socialist camp countries led by the Soviet Union, and it also proves well its iron-like unity for guaranteeing lasting peace and security for mankind.

The editorial said that at a time when the international balance of power is shifting in favor of socialism and the imperialist "position of strength" and "Cold War" policies have suffered a fatal bankruptcy, the Western ruling groups, under the pressure of peace-loving people all over the world, have also been forced to talk about "peace." However, people know that today the actions of the US imperialists run counter to their promises. The Korean people see this particularly clearly in the US imperialists' increasingly frantic war preparations in South Korea.

The editorial said: "US imperialism is also intensifying war preparations in the West. It openly promotes the so-called ten-year plan of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization to 'strengthen the military system', revives the mortal enemy of Europe and all mankind - West German revanchists - and helps it to carry out nuclear armament. Under these conditions, it is entirely justified for the Warsaw Treaty Member States to demand the conclusion of a peace treaty with the present two Germanys and to declare that if the West German Adenauer group continues to refuse to conclude a peace treaty, they will conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic and on this basis find a solution to the West Berlin issue."

The editorial said: "The Warsaw Treaty Member States' Declaration is a heavy blow to the US aggressive clique, making it no longer easy for the US aggressive clique to continue to carry out war preparations and 'Cold War' activities on the pretext of the so-called 'communist threat' which simply does not exist." The editorial emphasized: "The facts are already very clear that if the imperialists continue their provocative war conspiracies, they can only bring about the tragic consequences of self-destruction."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 6th: Vietnam's "Nhan Dan" published an editorial on February 6th saying that the declaration issued by the regular meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty Member States once again demonstrates the sincere desire for peace and the firm will to defend peace of the Warsaw Treaty Member States and the socialist countries led by the Soviet Union.

The editorial said: "At a time when imperialist countries, especially the warmongers of the United States, are still stubbornly pursuing a policy of creating tension and preparing for war, and at a time when the North Atlantic aggressive bloc is constantly clamoring to strengthen armaments, the sincere actions and proposals of the Warsaw Treaty Member States further demonstrate the peace policy of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp. At the same time, the people of the world can therefore see more clearly the despicable conspiracies hidden behind the false peace of the Western countries."

The editorial said that the regular meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty Member States condemned imperialist war conspiracies and issued a severe warning to those who attempt to resolve international disputes by force. The editorial pointed out that this warning is by no means empty talk. The socialist camp led by the Soviet Union is stronger than imperialism. The recent successful launch of a multi-stage rocket by the Soviet Union into the Pacific Ocean once again proves that the Soviet Union has far surpassed the United States in science and technology. The invincible strength of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp and the development of the world peace movement are making the international situation tend towards detente. This force is a powerful guarantee for further improving the international situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, February 6th: Mongolia's "Unen" published an editorial on February 6th, welcoming the results of the Moscow meeting of the Warsaw Treaty Member States.

When discussing the efforts of socialist countries to dedicate themselves to the cause of peace, the editorial emphasized that there is still a stubborn and influential force in Western countries that opposes consolidating peace, and the North Atlantic Group of countries continues to expand their armaments and equip West Germany with rockets and nuclear weapons. In the East, the new US-Japan military alliance treaty has led Japan back onto the dangerous path of preparing for war and launching aggression against other countries.

When discussing the meeting's expression of the need to use the common strength of the socialist camp to smash the Adenauer government's shameless conspiracy, the editorial pointed out that this is a serious warning to West German militarist forces and their supporters. The editorial said that the people of the socialist camp, including Mongolia, fully support the position of the Warsaw Treaty Member States: that in the event that the West does not agree to conclude a peace treaty with the two Germanys, the Warsaw Treaty Member States will conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic.

    苏联“真理报”评华沙条约缔约国宣言
    社会主义阵营是争取和平的战斗先锋队
    朝越等国报纸指出美国空谈和平加紧备战
    新华社8日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”今天就华沙条约缔约国宣言发表了一篇题为“伟大和崇高的目的”的社论。
    社论说，在自己的队伍中团结着十亿多人的壮大的社会主义阵营，是人类在争取和平的斗争中的久经考验的战斗先锋队。昨天“真理报”发表的华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会会议的文件中又一次鲜明地表明了社会主义国家是爱好和平的。
    华沙条约政治协商委员会莫斯科会议是社会主义大家庭各国争取加强和平的斗争的重要里程碑。
    社论说，会议是在充分互相谅解和巩固友谊的气氛中进行的，它表明，无论在对国际局势的估价方面以及在所讨论的具体问题上，意见都是一致的。
    社论说，所有意志善良的人都为下面这种情况感到欢欣鼓舞：国际舞台上力量的现况保证爱好和平的国家的力量和和平力量大大超过战争势力。苏联在共产主义建设中的辉煌胜利，人民中国和其他社会主义国家经济的蓬勃发展，它们在统一的社会主义阵营范围内的进一步团结，社会主义国家在争取和平的斗争中积极性的新的高涨，成了国际局势好转的基础。摆脱了殖民地和半殖民地从属地位的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲爱好和平国家的国际作用正在进一步提高。这一切在为达到一个伟大和崇高的目标——取得巩固和持久和平创造有利的条件。
    社论说，宣言中强调指出，世界力量的对比变得越来越有利于主张停止火箭—核军备及其他军备竞赛、主张消除“冷战”、主张社会制度和意识形态不同的各国和平共处的人。现在形成了这样一种局面：任何侵略国家想诉诸武力解决国际争端和走上战争道路的任何企图，势必导致和平的破坏者立即遭到彻底的粉碎。
    社论说，西方有影响的势力不愿意考虑各国人民的这种日益迫切的要求，他们继续顽固地反对加强和平，西方国家拼凑的军事集团维持着庞大的军队，而且在继续进行军备竞赛，西德国防军装备着火箭武器，日本的军国主义势力正在明显地活跃起来。宣言着重指出，但是“冷战”拥护者的任何一个企图都不能改变这样一个事实：意识到和平共处的必要性现在正成为国际关系发展中的决定因素。
    社论说，当代国际生活中主要问题是裁军问题。爱好和平的人类完全赞同苏联的裁军计划和社会主义国家在实现这个计划方面所采取的实际步骤，他们等待西方国家也采取这样的具体行动。
    社论接着说，在目前国际局势中，毫不拖延地解决德国问题有非常重要的意义。社会主义国家一贯主张签订对德和约和在把西柏林变为自由城市的基础上解决西柏林问题。德意志民主共和国——第一个工农的德意志国家——表示完全愿意这样做。但是德意志联邦共和国政府千方百计地反对这样做，它还在幻想修改边界、幻想复仇。波恩幻想家的这种荒谬的想法注定是要失败的。
    社论说，华沙条约是一个爱好和平的组织，它所提出的在华沙条约组织和北大西洋公约组织这两个国家集团之间签订互不侵犯条约的建议，是从和平友好的愿望出发的。华沙条约缔约国声明，这项建议仍然有效，他们准备在任何时候同北大西洋公约组织成员国签订互不侵犯条约。
    社论说，全世界现在密切注视着最高级会晤的准备情况。与会者对已就这个问题达成协议感到非常满意。他们认为，在将要举行的政府首脑会议上应当讨论像全面彻底裁军问题、包括建立西柏林自由城市在内的对德和约问题、禁止试验原子武器和氢武器问题、东西方关系问题这样一些极其重要而且成熟了的问题。与会国表示希望政府首脑能够找到圆满解决上述问题的正确道路。
    社论最后说，华沙条约缔约国的宣言受到世界各国人民越来越广泛的支持，并且会产生意义重大的成果。
    新华社平壤6日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表社论说：华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会会议是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家一贯坚持的爱好和平的外交政策的巨大示威，同时也很好地证明了它为保障人类持久和平和安全的钢铁般的团结一致。
    社论说，在国际力量对比向有利于社会主义方面转变，帝国主义的“实力地位”和“冷战”政策遭到了致命的破产的时候，西方统治集团在全世界爱好和平的人民压力下也不得不谈“和平”。但是，人民都知道，今天美帝国主义者的行动是和它的诺言背道而驰的。朝鲜人民从美帝国主义在南朝鲜更加疯狂地进行战争准备的活动中看得特别清楚。
    社论说：“美帝国主义在西方也同样地加剧战争准备。它公然促进侵略性的北大西洋公约组织的所谓“加强军事体制”十年计划，复活欧洲和全人类的死敌——西德复仇主义者，并帮助它进行核武装。在这种条件下，华沙条约缔约国要求同现在的两个德国缔结和约，并宣布如果西德阿登纳集团始终拒绝缔结和约的话，就将同德意志民主共和国缔结和约，并在这基础上找到解决西柏林问题的出路，这是完全正当的。
    社论说：“华沙条约缔约国宣言对美国侵略集团的两面手法是一个沉重的打击，使美国侵略集团再不能轻易地借口根本不存在的所谓‘共产主义威胁’，继续进行战争准备和‘冷战’活动。”社论强调指出：“事实已经很明显，如果帝国主义者继续进行挑衅性的战争阴谋，就只能给它带来自我灭亡的悲惨结果。”
    新华社河内6日电　越南“人民报”6日发表社论说，华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会例会发表的宣言再一次说明华沙条约缔约国和以苏联为首的社会主义国家对和平的诚挚愿望和保卫和平的坚决意志。
    社论说：“正当帝国主义国家、特别是美国好战分子仍然顽固地执行制造紧张局势、准备战争的政策的时候，正当北大西洋侵略集团不断地叫嚣加强军备的时候，华沙条约缔约国的诚意的行动和建议进一步表明了苏联和整个社会主义阵营的和平政策，同时，全世界人民也因此更清楚地看到西方国家的假和平所隐藏的卑劣阴谋。”
    社论说，华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会例会谴责帝国主义战争阴谋，并严厉警告企图用武力解决国际争端的人。社论指出，这个警告决不是空话。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营比帝国主义强大。苏联最近向太平洋地区发射多级火箭的成功，再一次证明苏联在科学技术方面把美国远远地抛在后头。苏联和社会主义阵营的不可战胜的力量和世界和平运动的发展使国际局势趋向缓和。这个力量是进一步改善国际局势的有力保证。
    新华社乌兰巴托6日电　蒙古“真理报”6日发表社论，欢迎华沙条约缔约国莫斯科会议的结果。
    社论在谈到社会主义国家致力于和平事业的努力时着重指出，在西方国家仍然有一股顽固的反对巩固和平的有影响的势力，北大西洋集团国家仍然继续进行扩军活动和以火箭、核武器武装西德。在东方，新的美日军事同盟条约已把日本重新引上准备战争和向别的国家发动侵略的危险道路。
    社论在谈到会议表示要以社会主义阵营的共同力量来粉碎阿登纳政府的无耻的阴谋时指出，这是对西德军国主义势力及其支持者的严重警告。社论说，包括蒙古在内的社会主义阵营的各国人民完全支持华沙条约缔约国的立场：即在西方不同意同两个德国缔结和约的情况下，华沙条约缔约国将同德意志民主共和国缔结和约。
