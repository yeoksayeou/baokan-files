    Popularize Automobile Train Formation
    *People's Daily* Commentator
    In conjunction with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1959, the "Safety, Economy, 10,000 Ton-Kilometers per Ton of Vehicle per Month" campaign launched by the national automobile transportation departments also achieved brilliant results. In particular, Shandong and Henan provinces' successful experiences in achieving 10,000 ton-kilometers per ton of vehicle per month across the entire province set an example for the continued leap forward in national automobile transportation this year.
    The "Safety, Economy, 10,000 Ton-Kilometers per Ton of Vehicle per Month" campaign was proposed under the situation of the great leap forward in China's national economy, in order to better guarantee the transportation needs of industry, agriculture, capital construction, and commerce. It is a concentrated manifestation of the automobile transportation workers' implementation of the Party's general line for socialist construction. From the launch of this campaign in March of last year to today, only ten months have passed, but the development of national automobile transportation efficiency has almost doubled. In 1958, the national average was 3,423 ton-kilometers per ton of vehicle per month, while in 1959, the national average reached about 5,000 ton-kilometers per ton of vehicle per month. This rapidly developing situation will play an important role in promoting the continued great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the great exchange of materials between urban and rural areas.
    1960 is a year of better and more comprehensive continued leaps forward in industrial and agricultural production and the entire economic construction. With the development of production, transportation tasks are even more arduous. The task before the national automobile transportation workers is to further tap the potential of automobile transportation and promote all aspects of transportation through the "Safety, Economy, 10,000 Ton-Kilometers per Ton of Vehicle per Month" campaign, and to find various ways to increase the volume of transportation under the premise of "safety and economy," so as to ensure the completion of arduous and glorious transportation tasks. According to the experience of advanced units in Shandong, Henan, and other places, in order to achieve a large-scale harvest of ton-kilometers per ton of vehicle per month, it is necessary to universally implement automobile train formation. From the perspective of single-vehicle transport efficiency, if a medium-sized vehicle generally uses one vehicle with three trailers, with each trailer carrying three tons, the transport capacity can be increased by about two times; if double-shift transportation is implemented at the same time, one vehicle with three trailers is equivalent to the role of five vehicles. At present, Shandong freight vehicles can generally achieve one vehicle with two trailers on average, and the utilization rate of trailers in the province has reached 70%, and the output of trailers has exceeded more than twice the output of the main vehicle. It can be seen that the universal implementation of automobile train formation is not only a means to overcome the shortage of transport capacity in the current situation of rapidly increasing transport volume and the inability to increase the number of vehicles in large quantities, but also the direction of highway transportation development for a considerable period of time in the future, and it is the most effective method to increase effective carrying capacity, improve productivity, save fuel, and reduce costs.
    Some people say: "Trailers can be used on the plains, but not in the mountains." In fact, today's automobile trains are not only running in mountainous areas with poor conditions, but have long been running on the Tibetan Plateau, the roof of the world. Some people say: "Short distances are okay, but long distances may not be okay?" However, the situation in Sichuan Province dispelled their doubts. The transportation company in this province used automobile trains with a carrying capacity of 11.5 tons to conduct long-distance transportation tests in hilly and mountainous areas, passing through thirteen counties and cities, and the train traveled a distance of 1,335.5 kilometers. How can you say that long-distance trailers are not possible? Some people also say: "New cars and gasoline cars are okay, but old cars and charcoal cars are not okay." The experiences of Henan, Guangxi, and other places have proved that old cars and charcoal cars can also use trailers as long as they are strengthened in maintenance and pay attention to safety. Most of the main vehicles that tow trains in Xuchang Transportation Company in Henan are old cars, and these old cars can also tow three trailers for regular transportation; the Guilin Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Transportation Bureau in Guangxi once conducted an experiment, in which a six-wheeled four-ton "International" brand charcoal car was able to tow thirty-eight trailers with a load of 182 tons. All of these "not possible" have been proven to be "very possible" in front of the heroic automobile workers. This year, we have accumulated rich experience in trailer transportation and have a better material and technical foundation than in the past, and the conditions for achieving "10,000 ton-kilometers per ton of vehicle per month" are even better.
    "Safety, Economy, 10,000 Ton-Kilometers per Ton of Vehicle per Month" is a comprehensive requirement for the automobile transportation industry and automobile transportation workers. We need more teams, companies, special districts, and provinces to reach the target of "10,000 ton-kilometers per ton of vehicle per month," and break through this target to move towards higher targets. Under the premise of "safety and economy," fully implement the Party's general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better and more economical results. We hope that all types of work in the automobile transportation department will participate in this movement. Raise the banner of "Safety, Economy, 10,000 Ton-Kilometers per Ton of Vehicle per Month" and drive all aspects and the entire chain.
    All comrades on the automobile transportation front! Drivers, maintenance workers, material clerks, fuel clerks, technicians, and comrades in all aspects of living welfare, join hands and leap forward together, so that our automobile transportation industry can run at full speed and sprint forward!

    普遍推广汽车列车化
    本报评论员
    在1959年工农业生产大跃进的同时，全国汽车运输部门开展的“安全、节约、车吨月产万吨公里”运动，也取得了辉煌的成就。尤其山东、河南在全省范围内实现了车吨月产万吨公里成功的经验，为今年全国汽车运输的继续跃进树立了榜样。
    “安全、节约、车吨月产万吨公里”运动，是在我国国民经济大跃进的形势下，为了更好地保证工业、农业、基本建设、商业对运输的需要而提出来的。它是汽车运输职工贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线的集中表现。从去年3月开展这一运动到今天，不过十个月，但是全国汽车运输效率的发展几乎是成倍地增长。1958年全国汽车平均车吨月产三千四百二十三吨公里，而1959年全国汽车平均车吨月产就达到了五千吨公里左右。这种飞跃发展的形势，对于工农业生产的继续大跃进、城乡物资的大交流，将起重要的促进作用。
    1960年，是工农业生产以及整个经济建设更好、更全面继续跃进的一年。随着生产的发展，运输任务更为繁重。摆在全国汽车运输职工面前的任务，是进一步发挥汽车运输的潜力，通过“安全、节约、车吨月产万吨公里”运动，把运输方面的各个环节带动起来，在“安全、节约”的前提下，想各种办法提高运输量，保证完成艰巨而光荣的运输任务。根据山东、河南等地先进单位的经验，要使车吨月产获得大面积丰收，必须普遍实行汽车列车化。从单车的运效看，一般中等载重量的汽车如实行一车三挂，每挂载重三吨，运力就约可增加两倍；若同时实行双班运输，一车三挂，则相当于发挥五辆汽车的作用。目前山东货运汽车平均都能达到一车两挂，全省的挂车利用率达到70％，挂车的产量已超过主车产量的一倍以上。由此可见，普遍推行汽车列车化，这不仅在当前运量剧增而汽车还不能大量增加的情况下，是克服运力不足的手段，而且也是今后相当长的时间内公路运输发展的方向，是增加有效载重量、提高生产率、节约燃料和降低成本的最有效的方法。
    有人说：“平原可以挂车，山区不行。”事实上现在的汽车列车不仅仅已经在条件不好的山区行驶，而且早已在世界屋脊的西藏高原上行驶了。有人说：“短途可以，长途怕不行吧？”然而，四川省的情况却打消了他们的怀疑。这个省的运输公司可以载重十一吨半的汽车列车，在丘陵区和山区进行了长途运输试验，路经十三个县市，列车载重行程到达了一千三百三十五点五公里。怎能说长途挂车不行呢？也有人说：“新车、汽油车可以，旧车、木炭车不行。”河南、广西等地的经验却证明了旧车、木炭车只要加强维修、注意安全，也能挂车。河南许昌运输公司拖带列车的主车大部是旧车，这些旧车也能拖三辆挂车经常运输；广西桂林专署交通运输局曾作过试验，六轮四吨的“万国”牌木炭车，能拖带三十八辆挂车，载重一百八十二吨。所有这一些“不行”，在英雄的汽车职工面前，已经证明了“很行”。在今年，当我们已经积累了丰富的拖挂运输经验，有了比过去更好的物质技术基础，实现“车吨月产万吨公里”的条件更好了。
    “安全、节约、车吨月产万吨公里”，是对汽车运输事业和汽车运输职工的全面要求。我们需要更多的车队、公司、专区、省达到“车吨月产万吨公里”的指标，并且突破这个指标，向更高的指标迈进。在“安全、节约”的前提下，全面贯彻党的多快好省的方针。我们希望汽车运输部门的各个工种都要参加这一运动。举起“安全、节约、车吨月产万吨公里”的旗帜，把各个环节，整个链条都带动起来。
    汽车运输战线上的全体同志们！司机员、保修员、材料员、油料员、技术人员和生活福利等各方面的同志们，携手并肩，共同跃进，让我们的汽车运输事业开足马力向前飞奔！
