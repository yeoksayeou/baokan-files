    Studying Marxism-Leninism and Transforming Worldview
    Xu Feiguang
    Regarding the relationship between studying Marxism-Leninism and transforming one’s worldview, there have been two erroneous views in the past. Some people believe that Marxism-Leninism is a body of scientific knowledge, and therefore, it can be mastered simply by studying hard, with no connection to the transformation of one's worldview. If someone says that studying theory must be combined with the transformation of one's worldview, then they consider this to be "using a cannon to shoot a sparrow." Others believe that since Marxism-Leninism is the science of revolution, reading Marxist-Leninist works will naturally transform one's worldview. Therefore, they propose: "The more specialized and profound one's study of Marxism-Leninism, the redder one becomes." These two views may seem different, but in reality, they are the same: they both deny the necessity of combining the study of Marxism-Leninism with the transformation of one's worldview and disagree with the requirement of being both red and expert for those who study Marxism-Leninism. In this way, Marxism-Leninism becomes a subject that anyone can master simply by studying hard.
    Marxism-Leninism is a science, the crystallization of human class struggle and the knowledge of the struggle for production. To truly master this science, diligent study is of course indispensable. However, a person standing on the bourgeois position, even if they have read all the works of Marxism-Leninism, still cannot truly grasp Marxism-Leninism. For them, they can neither become "specialized and profound," nor can they become "red." The world can have bourgeois physicists, chemists, and doctors. Although their bourgeois worldview and the scientific principles they study may be contradictory, and this may affect their ability to make greater achievements in this science, since these sciences themselves are without class character, the bourgeoisie can also master them to serve themselves. However, it is absolutely impossible for bourgeois theorists of Marxism-Leninism to exist; there can only be bourgeois anti-Marxist-Leninist "theorists." Because Marxism-Leninism is the science of proletarian revolution, the fighting weapon in the hands of the proletariat; only those who truly stand on the position of the working class can truly grasp its essence.
    This situation is determined by the characteristics of Marxism-Leninism itself. Comrade Mao Zedong once said in "On Practice": "Marxist philosophy, dialectical materialism, has two most distinct characteristics. One is its class character: it openly avows that dialectical materialism is in the service of the proletariat. The other is its practicality: it emphasizes the dependence of theory on practice, emphasizes that theory is based on practice and in turn serves practice." Obviously, a person standing on the bourgeois position who studies Marxism-Leninism can neither understand its class character nor its practicality. On the contrary, in the process of studying Marxism-Leninism, they will inevitably deny these two characteristics. Because, if they acknowledge the class character of Marxism-Leninism, then they must abandon the bourgeois position, which will inevitably conflict with their egoistic ideology. In contrast to the working class, who study Marxism-Leninism for the needs of the revolution, they study Marxism-Leninism only to achieve their personal goals. Therefore, they are incompatible with the class character of Marxism-Leninism. As for the practicality of Marxism-Leninism, they are even more likely to adopt a negative attitude. What they fear most is the concrete application of Marxism-Leninism, because the implementation of Marxism-Leninism means the elimination of all exploiting classes, which will inevitably infringe upon their interests. What they like most is to treat Marxism-Leninism as a kind of "conceptual game" and so-called "pure science" that has nothing to do with class struggle and is never to be implemented. This can both avoid shaking their own position and achieve the goal of gaining both fame and wealth. For example, the theory of continuous revolution in Marxism-Leninism is easily understood and accepted by the working class, because not only does this theory not conflict with their class interests, but only through continuous revolution can they completely get rid of the status of being oppressed and enslaved. However, for those whose bourgeois worldview has not been transformed, the situation is different. Although they can recite this principle, in reality, they fear continuous revolution the most. They may participate in the revolution under certain conditions, but as Lenin said, they are fundamentally unwilling to carry out changes in the entire society for the benefit of the revolutionary proletariat; they only want the social system to undergo a change that can make the existing society as pleasant and comfortable as possible for them. And the continuous revolution of society means losing their original privileged position. Therefore, in practice, they will inevitably oppose the idea of continuous revolution. In short, as long as a person has bourgeois ideas, they cannot and will not be willing to carry the revolutionary dialectic through to the end. We know that Hegel's philosophy has a rational kernel of dialectics. However, Hegel did not dare to extend the dialectic to the final conclusion, because if he did, it would fundamentally negate the old system he was trying to protect and his own objective idealist system. Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "The Marxist method is the telescope and microscope in politics and military affairs," and studying it will make us smarter. However, this weapon can only be mastered by the proletariat. As for those who cling to the bourgeois position, they will never be able to truly master it.
    For those who stand on the bourgeois position, Marxism-Leninism will inevitably conflict with their basic ideas. There are only two possible outcomes for them studying Marxism-Leninism. One outcome is that, in the process of studying, they gradually abandon the bourgeois worldview, accept the Marxist-Leninist worldview, and thus resolve the contradiction between the two. In this way, they may gradually become a true Marxist-Leninist. Many of our Marxists have come this way. The other outcome is that, in the process of studying, they continue to adhere to the bourgeois worldview. In this way, when their bourgeois worldview conflicts with Marxist-Leninist views, they will use their own bourgeois views to distort Marxist-Leninist views, extract the two fundamental characteristics of practicality and class character, and turn it into a rigid thing that protects their own bourgeois interests. This is exactly the path that all revisionists have taken.
    In short, whether or not one can master Marxism-Leninism is not determined by how many books you have read or how rich your theoretical knowledge is, but by what position you stand on and what purpose you hold when studying it. If the direction and purpose are correct, even if the cultural level is lower and the knowledge is temporarily not very rich, as long as you work hard, you can truly master Marxism-Leninism. Conversely, if the direction and purpose are wrong, no matter how many Marxist-Leninist works you have read and how rich your knowledge is, you will still be completely ignorant of the simple principles of Marxism-Leninism.
    However, does this mean that one can only start studying Marxism-Leninism after one's worldview has been transformed? Of course not.
    Studying Marxism-Leninism and transforming one's worldview are two inseparable aspects. On the one hand, only by constantly transforming one's own worldview can one truly grasp the spirit of Marxism-Leninism. On the other hand, the transformation of one's worldview must be carried out under the guidance of correct theory. These two aspects are closely linked and mutually reinforcing. Therefore, one cannot separate the study of Marxism-Leninism and the transformation of one's worldview into two different stages.
    The reasoning is not complicated. Those who come from the bourgeoisie or are deeply influenced by the bourgeoisie often bring in a lot of bourgeois things when they join the revolutionary ranks. Of course, they should not wait until their worldview has been transformed before studying Marxism-Leninism, but should actively participate in revolutionary mass movements and other practical struggles, while diligently studying Marxism-Leninism. However, when they study Marxism-Leninism, they must first be determined to use Marxism-Leninism to transform their own bourgeois worldview and use Marxism-Leninism to guide their actions. Only in this way can they gradually grasp the essence of Marxism-Leninism. As a result, this will inevitably transform their worldview, thereby enabling them to further grasp Marxism-Leninism.
    In the final analysis, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, "As far as mastery of Marxist theory is concerned, it consists in knowing how to master and apply it; mastery without application is not mastery at all." "Marxism attaches importance to theory precisely and only because it can guide action. If we have a correct theory but merely prate about it, pigeonhole it and do not put it into practice, then that theory, however good, is of no significance." Those who want to study Marxism-Leninism well but do not want to use this theory to guide their actions are bound to say one thing and do another, have one set of appearances and another set of inner worlds, which makes them have two mutually contradictory personalities, and the inconsistency between words and deeds, the separation of theory and practice, is precisely the characteristic of the bourgeoisie. This kind of person is definitely not the Marxist-Leninist we need. Therefore, we must combine the study of Marxism-Leninism with the transformation of our worldview, combine breaking the bourgeois worldview with establishing the proletarian worldview, combine being red and expert, and combine theory and practice, so that we can become Marxist-Leninists in the true sense of the word.

    学习马克思列宁主义和改造世界观
    徐非光
    关于学习马克思列宁主义和改造世界观的关系，曾经有过以下两种错误的看法。有人认为，马克思列宁主义是一门科学知识，因此，只要通过努力读书就可以掌握它，与世界观的改造并没有什么联系。如果有人说学习理论必须与世界观的改造结合起来，那么他们就认为这是“用大炮打麻雀”。也有人认为，马克思列宁主义既然是关于革命的科学，那么读了马克思列宁主义的著作就自然而然使世界观得到改造，因此，他们提出：“马克思列宁主义的学习，专深亦即红透”。这两种看法似乎不尽相同，而实际上却是一样的，那就是否定学习马克思列宁主义和改造世界观相结合的必要性，不同意对学习马克思列宁主义的人提出又红又专的要求。这样一来，马克思列宁主义就成了任何人只要通过努力读书就可以掌握的学问了。
    马克思列宁主义是一门科学，是人类阶级斗争和生产斗争的知识的结晶。真正地掌握这门科学，当然离不开刻苦钻研。但是，站在资产阶级的立场上的人，尽管读遍了马克思列宁主义的一切著作，还是不能真正地掌握马克思列宁主义的。对于他们来说，既不能“专深”，更谈不到“红透”。世界上可以有资产阶级的物理学家、化学家和医学家。尽管他们的资产阶级世界观和他们研究的科学原理存在着矛盾，并影响他们在这门科学上创造出更大的成就，但是由于这些科学本身是没有阶级性的，资产阶级也可以掌握它为自己服务。然而，世界上却绝对不可能出现资产阶级的马克思列宁主义的理论家，而只有资产阶级的反马克思列宁主义的“理论家”。因为马克思列宁主义是无产阶级革命的科学，是无产阶级手中的战斗武器；只有真正地站在工人阶级的立场上的人，才能真正地掌握它的精髓。
    这种情况是由马克思列宁主义的本身特点所决定的。毛泽东同志在“实践论”一文中曾经说过：“马克思主义的哲学辩证唯物论有两个最显著的特点：一个是它的阶级性，公然申明辩证唯物论是为无产阶级服务的；再一个是它的实践性，强调理论对于实践的依赖关系，理论的基础是实践，又转过来为实践服务。”很明显，站在资产阶级的立场上的人学习马克思列宁主义，既不可能了解它的阶级性，也不可能了解它的实践性。相反，他们在学习马克思列宁主义过程中，必然会否定了这两个特点。因为，如果承认了马克思列宁主义的阶级性，那就必须放弃资产阶级的立场，而这就必然与他们的唯我主义思想发生矛盾。与工人阶级为了革命的需要而学习马克思列宁主义相反，他们学习马克思列宁主义只是企图达到他们个人的目的。因此，他们和马克思列宁主义的阶级性是格格不入的。至于马克思列宁主义的实践性，他们更是要采取否定的态度了。他们最怕的是马克思列宁主义的具体运用，因为马克思列宁主义的贯彻就是消灭一切剥削阶级，而这就必然触犯到他们的利益。他们最欢喜的则是把马克思列宁主义当成是一种与阶级斗争无关的、永远不要实行的“概念游戏”和所谓“纯科学”。这就可以既不动摇自己的地位，又达到名利双收的目的。举例来说，马克思列宁主义的不断革命论，工人阶级就是很容易理解和接受的，因为不仅这个理论与他们的阶级利益毫无抵触，而且只有通过不断革命他们才能彻底地摆脱被压迫、被奴役的地位。但是，对于资产阶级的世界观没有得到改造的人，情况就不同了。尽管他们可以背诵这条原理，实际上他们却最害怕不断革命。他们在一定条件下也可以参加革命，但是正如列宁所说的，他们根本不愿为革命无产者的利益实行变革整个社会，他们只想使社会制度发生一种能把现存社会弄成对他们尽可能惬意和舒服些的改变。而社会的不断革命，就意味着丧失他们原来的优越地位。因此，他们在实际中就必然要反对不断革命的思想。总之，一个人只要存在着资产阶级的思想，就不能也不愿把革命的辩证法贯彻到底。我们知道，黑格尔的哲学中有着辩证法的合理内核。但是，黑格尔不敢把辩证法引伸到最后的结论，因为如果这样，那就会根本地否定了他自己所极力保护那种旧的制度和他自己的客观唯心主义体系。毛泽东同志曾经说过：“马克思主义的方法就是政治上军事上的望远镜和显微镜”，学习它会使得我们聪明起来。但是，这个武器只有无产阶级才能掌握。至于死抱住资产阶级的立场不放的人，他们是始终不能真正地掌握它的。
    对于站在资产阶级立场上的人来说，马克思列宁主义必然与他们的基本思想发生抵触。他们学习马克思列宁主义，只能有两种结果。一种结果是，在学习的过程中，逐步抛弃了资产阶级的世界观，接受了马克思列宁主义的世界观，从而解决了两者之间的矛盾。这样，他们就可能逐步变成一个真正的马克思列宁主义者。我们许多的马克思主义者正是通过这条道路走过来的。另一种结果则是，在学习的过程中，继续坚持资产阶级的世界观。这样，当他们的资产阶级世界观与马克思列宁主义观点发生抵触时，他们就要用自己的资产阶级的观点去歪曲马克思列宁主义的观点，抽去其实践性和阶级性的两个根本特点，使之变成保护自己的资产阶级利益的僵死的东西。这正是一切修正主义者所走过的道路。
    总之，能否掌握马克思列宁主义，不是决定于你读了多少书，有多么丰富的理论知识，而是决定于你站在什么立场上，抱着什么目的去学习它。方向和目的对了头，尽管文化水平低一些，知识暂时还不太丰富，但是只要通过艰苦努力，就可以真正地掌握马克思列宁主义。与此相反，方向和目的搞错了，尽管读了多少马克思列宁主义的著作，有多么丰富的知识，但是对马克思列宁主义的简单原理也还是一窍不通。
    但是，这是不是说，只有先改造好了世界观以后才能去着手学习马克思列宁主义呢？当然不是这样。
    学习马克思列宁主义和世界观的改造，这是不可分割的两个方面。一方面，只有不断地改造自己的世界观，才能真正地掌握马克思列宁主义的精神实质。另一方面，世界观的改造又必须在正确的理论的指导下进行。这两个方面是密切联系、互相促进的。因此，不能够把学习马克思列宁主义和改造世界观分做两个不同的阶段来进行。
    道理并不复杂。那些出身于资产阶级或受资产阶级影响较深的人，参加到革命队伍里来，往往带进大量的资产阶级的东西。当然，他们不应当等到改造好了世界观才去学习马克思列宁主义，而应当积极地参加革命群众运动和其他实践斗争，同时认真地学习马克思列宁主义。但是，他们在学习马克思列宁主义时，首先必须下定决心用马克思列宁主义来改造自己的资产阶级的世界观，并且运用马克思列宁主义来指导自己的行动。只有如此，才可能逐渐地掌握马克思列宁主义的实质。结果，这就必然使他们的世界观得到改造，从而使他们得以进一步地掌握马克思列宁主义。
    归根结底，正如毛泽东同志所说的，“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用”。“马克思主义看重理论，正是，也仅仅是，因为它能够指导行动。如果有了正确的理论，只是把它空谈一阵，束之高阁，并不实行，那末，这种理论再好也是没有意义的”。要学好马克思列宁主义的人，却不想用这个理论去指导自己的行动，他们必然是说的是一套，做的又是一套，外表是一套，内心世界又是另一套，这就使他们具有了两重互相矛盾的人格，而言行不一，理论与实际脱离，恰恰是资产阶级的特点。这种人绝对不是我们所需要的马克思列宁主义者。因此，我们必须把马克思列宁主义的学习和世界观的改造结合起来，把破资产阶级世界观和立无产阶级世界观结合起来，把红与专结合起来，把理论与实践结合起来，使自己成为名副其实的马克思列宁主义者。
