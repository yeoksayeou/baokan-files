Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, February 9th: In order to ensure a bumper summer harvest and promote the smooth regreening of wheat, a vigorous upsurge of drought resistance and wheat irrigation has taken shape in various parts of Henan.

Henan Province planted sufficient wheat this year, the planting was good, winter management was timely, and growth is good. However, spring drought has gradually occurred throughout the province. Since October last year, rainfall and snowfall have been very scarce. Except for the Huainan area, about eighty counties and cities have experienced a one-third reduction in rainfall compared to the same period last year. In the especially severely drought-stricken northern Henan, rainfall has decreased by about half compared to the same period in previous years. Due to prolonged drought, most reservoirs and other water conservancy projects did not store much water after last year's drought resistance efforts, and the water volume in rivers and mountain springs has also been greatly reduced.

In response to this situation, people's communes in various regions, with the same spirit as last year's hundred-day drought resistance campaign to protect the autumn harvest, are fighting the spring drought, making every effort to tap water sources, and irrigating wheat early for regreening. After the thaw, Mengjin County in the Luoyang area organized 869 specialized teams to rush irrigation of wheat for regreening, with an average of 1.5 million cubic meters of water flowing into the wheat fields every day. During the Spring Festival, the Hengshui People's Commune of this county checked the soil moisture in the wheat fields and found that the moisture content was generally only about 13%. The entire commune immediately organized more than 10,000 people to use pumps, waterwheels, windlasses, pulleys, and other water lifting tools to resist drought and irrigate 20,000 mu of wheat. Wheat fields that had been irrigated for regreening began to regreen half a month earlier. Meng County in the Xinxiang area has recently reached a daily irrigation progress of more than 28,000 mu. After the Spring Festival, the county has irrigated more than 160,000 mu for regreening, applied regreening fertilizer to more than 120,000 mu, and simultaneously cultivated and compacted more than 90,000 mu.

The water conservancy projects newly built throughout the province last winter have begun to exert their power in the current drought resistance. The more than 450,000 channels, more than 70,000 ponds, weirs, and dams, and more than 10,000 self-flowing springs completed last winter alone have expanded the irrigated area by more than 20 million mu and improved the irrigated area by more than 26 million mu. Many areas, while developing self-flowing irrigation, are also engaged in a second set of equipment, digging wells everywhere, to ensure double insurance for well and canal irrigation, ensuring that there is still sufficient water for wheat field irrigation when surface water dries up.

The Henan Provincial Party Committee recently held an emergency meeting on drought resistance and wheat irrigation, calling on the people of the province to fight hard in February and ensure the smooth passage of the wheat field regreening period. In the current situation of insufficient surface water sources, full use should be made of groundwater, and wells should be dug in a concentrated manner. In mountainous and hilly areas where wells cannot be dug, waterwheel groups and lifting pole forests should also be used in a concentrated manner to carry out water diversion up the mountains for irrigation, add machine pumping stations, and ensure that the spring drought is eliminated before the wheat regreens.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, February 9th: The drought in Shaanxi continues to develop. The people of the province have established the idea that man will conquer nature and resist drought for a long time. Starting from the worst-case scenario, even if there is no thorough rain before the summer harvest, they must strive for a bumper summer crop harvest and timely completion of spring sowing.

At present, the drought resistance struggle in the province has achieved major achievements. As of before the Spring Festival, the province's winter irrigation area for wheat fields and spring-sown crop land has reached more than 17.91 million mu (including 4.98 million mu of sprinkling and carrying ice to moisten the fields), an increase of 1.5 times compared to the same period last year; the wheat field irrigation area accounts for 55.7% of the total area, more than double the same period last year; winter cultivation of wheat fields has accounted for 54.8% of the total wheat field area, which is 7.4 times that of the same period last year. In conjunction with winter irrigation, winter cultivation and moisture preservation were carried out on the land for spring-sown crops. Immediately after winter irrigation, an even larger-scale mass drought resistance movement was launched. In areas with water conservancy facilities throughout the province, irrigation did not stop during the Spring Festival, with people taking breaks but water not stopping. Dali County generally irrigated irrigable wheat fields twice before the Spring Festival, and now it has irrigated more than 80,000 mu of wheat fields for the third time.

After last year's hundred-day drought in the autumn, Shaanxi Province suffered another hundred-day drought last winter and this spring that had not been seen in nearly 18 years. From mid-September to early October last year, thorough rain fell in various parts of the province, and winter crops were sown. Since then, there has been no thorough rain (snow). According to measurements by relevant departments, from November last year to now, the rainfall in northern Shaanxi is only 18% to 46% of the average rainfall in previous years; the Guanzhong area is 13% to 39%; and the southern Shaanxi area is 67% to 85%. Since last winter, the temperature throughout the province has been higher than in previous years, so the evaporation is greater than in previous years, and the soil moisture content in various places is very different from previous years. At the same time, the winter drought appeared after the autumn drought, and the river flow has also been greatly reduced. The Wei River flow is about half of the same period in previous years, and the Jing River is reduced by more than two-thirds. There is no water storage in the reservoirs in southern Shaanxi. All of this seriously threatens the growth of winter crops and spring sowing. According to meteorological forecasts, there will be very little rainfall in February and March, and the drought may continue.

This situation determines that defeating the drought is the key to winning the first season harvest in the province this year and doing a good job in spring sowing. Therefore, as soon as the winter drought emerged in November last year, the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee instructed all localities to quickly launch a winter irrigation movement, and leading cadres of many regions, counties, and people's communes went to the front line of drought resistance. Therefore, a mass drought resistance movement throughout the province quickly and vigorously developed. Since the beginning of January this year, two to three million people have participated in the drought resistance struggle every day throughout the province.

In the drought resistance struggle, people's communes in various regions have made every effort to use all water sources and all tools, striving to return every drop of water to the fields. At the same time, they vigorously improved irrigation methods, used water rationally and economically, and expanded the winter irrigation area. Various places have changed from large-furrow irrigation to small-furrow irrigation, and implemented methods such as combining vehicle flow, irrigating nearby land with wells, irrigating distant land with canals, and using cellars and pools together, which not only accelerated the speed but also improved the quality. Due to the conscientious implementation of economical water use, the Shuangquan Weir irrigation area in Hanzhong City has expanded the irrigation area by more than 40%. Qinghui Canal in Sanyuan County has adopted methods such as furrow irrigation and small-furrow irrigation, which greatly saved water. An average flow rate irrigates 1,450 mu per day, reaching a maximum of 1,680 mu, with an average irrigation of 49.5 cubic meters per mu.

In order to give full play to the role of winter-repaired water conservancy projects in drought resistance as soon as possible, all localities paid attention to project supporting, and generally newly-built water conservancy projects have achieved reservoir completion, canal connection, and land leveling. Forty percent of the newly-built projects and most of the renovated projects have been put into irrigation.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, February 9th: The mass movement to fight the spring drought has been launched in various parts of Shanxi. Jinan, Jindongnan, Jinzhong, and Jinbei areas have sent a large number of cadres to the grassroots organizations of the communes to fully mobilize drought prevention and drought resistance. While using the original water conservancy projects to irrigate wheat fields, the people's communes in the wheat-producing areas of Jinan carried out the "three rushes" (rushing spring irrigation, rushing summer irrigation, rushing flood season) and "two earlies" (early completion, early benefit) movement on the newly built water conservancy projects, and stepped up rush repairs to strive to play a role in resisting the spring drought. Wenxi County adopted the method of repairing projects, repairing canals, leveling land, and irrigating land at the same time. 85% of the water conservancy projects that have been built since last winter, which can expand the irrigation area by more than 100,000 mu, have played a role. On the one hand, the various communes in Fanshi County in Jinbei set off an ice-breaking irrigation and moisture-preserving activity to expand the irrigated area; on the other hand, they exchanged the experience of Yangmingbao Commune's Maohe Irrigation Area last year in rationally using water to irrigate 110,000 mu with one flow rate, so that the existing water sources could play the maximum role in preventing spring drought. Various places have also generally cultivated land to protect the soil and prevent spring drought.

From the Taihang Mountains and Jinan Plain in the south of Shanxi Province to the areas inside and outside the Great Wall in the north, there has been little snow and a lot of wind since November last year, and the snowfall is one-third less than normal. At present, the spring drought phenomenon has generally begun to appear throughout the province. The dry soil layer in most of the fields in Yuncheng, Pinglu, Wanrong, Linfen, Anze, and Xiangyuan counties has reached one to three inches. Some of the young seedlings of dry land wheat have withered, and the leaves have turned light green and yellow, which seriously threatens the regreening and growth of wheat. The poor soil moisture in the autumn land has also brought difficulties to spring plowing and sowing.

The Party committees and people's communes in various places have regarded defeating the spring drought as the central link in the preparation for farming, and have launched the "Opening Spring Red" production movement centered on drought prevention and drought resistance as early as possible. Recently, the provincial leading departments have also put forward various measures, such as: taking stock and actively expanding the spring irrigation area; vigorously grasping project supporting and machinery supporting to ensure timely irrigation; early spring irrigation, where there are water conservancy conditions, spring irrigation should be put into operation immediately, and areas that have not yet thawed should actively prepare for ice-breaking irrigation, and accumulate snow and ice where there is snow and ice; comprehensively plan water use, improve the utilization rate of water, and promote irrigation methods such as large-scale water dispersion, small-scale water concentration, and shallow furrow irrigation to achieve economical water use and expand the irrigation area; and universally promote all effective drought prevention and drought resistance measures such as harrowing the land to preserve moisture, so as to promote the drought resistance movement to further, comprehensively, and deeply develop.

    狠抓春灌　扑灭春旱
    河南、陕西、山西各地人民公社力争滴水归田做到株苗必保
    河南
    新华社郑州9日电　为了保证夏季大丰收，促使小麦过好返青关，一个轰轰烈烈的抗旱浇麦运动高潮已在河南各地形成。
    河南省今年小麦种得足，种得好，冬季管理及时，生长良好。但是，目前全省已陆续发生春旱。从去年10月到现在，雨雪非常稀少，除淮南地区外，大约有八十个县市都比去年同期降雨量减少三分之一；春旱特别严重的豫北地区，降雨量比往年同期减少一半左右。由于长期干旱，大部分坑塘、水库等水利工程在去年抗旱以后蓄水不多，河道、山泉的水量也大大减少。
    根据这种情况，各地人民公社就以去年百日抗旱保秋的劲头，大战春旱，千方百计挖掘水源，提前浇灌小麦返青水。洛阳专区孟津县在开冻后组织了八百六十九个专业队，突击浇灌小麦返青水，每天平均有一百五十万立方米水灌入麦田。这个县的横水人民公社春节期间检查麦田墒情时，发现含水量一般只有13％左右，全社立即组织一万多人，运用抽水机、水车、辘轳、滑轮等各种提水工具抗旱，浇麦两万亩，已浇过返青水的麦田都提早半个月开始返青。新乡专区孟县最近每天浇地进度也达到了两万八千多亩，全县春节后已浇返青水十六万多亩，施返青肥十二万多亩，同时中耕、镇压了九万多亩。
    去年冬季全省新修的水利工程，在当前抗旱中开始发挥威力。仅去冬完成的四十五万多条渠道，七万多处塘、堰、坝和一万多处自流泉，就扩大灌溉面积两千多万亩，改善灌溉面积两千六百多万亩，很多地区在发展自流灌溉的同时，大搞第二套设备，遍挖机井，做到井渠灌溉双保险，保证地上水干涸的时候，麦田灌溉仍有充足水源。
    中共河南省委最近又召开抗旱浇麦紧急会议，号召全省人民大战2月份，过好麦田返青关。在当前地上水源不足的情况下，要充分利用地下水，突击打井。在不能打井的山区、丘陵区，也要集中运用水车群、吊杆林，大搞引水上山工程，提水灌溉，增设机器抽水站，保证把春旱消灭在小麦返青以前。
    陕西
    新华社西安9日电　陕西旱象继续发展，全省人民树立人定胜天和长期抗旱的思想，从最坏的情况出发，即使在夏收以前不下透雨，也要力争夏季作物丰收和适时地完成春耕播种任务。
    目前全省抗旱斗争已经取得重大成就。截至春节以前，全省麦田和春播作物土地冬灌面积已达一千七百九十一万多亩（包括泼浇和背冰润田四百九十八万亩），比去年同期增加一点五倍；麦田受水面积占总面积55．7％，比去年同期增加一倍多；冬锄麦田已占麦田总面积54．8％，为去年同期的七点四倍。结合冬灌，对春播作物土地进行了冬耕保墒。紧接着冬灌之后，又掀起了一个规模更大的群众性抗旱运动。全省有水利设施的地区，在春节期间几乎都是人息水不停，没有停止灌溉。大荔县春节前普遍给可以灌溉的麦田灌了两遍水，现在又给八万多亩麦田灌了第三遍水。
    陕西省继去年秋季百日大旱以后，去冬今春又遭受到近十八年来没有过的百日大旱。去年9月中旬至10月上旬全省各地降过透雨，播种了越冬作物，以后再没有下过透雨（雪）。据有关部门测量，从去年11月到现在，陕北地区降雨量仅为历年平均降雨量的18％至46％；关中地区为13％至39％；陕南地区为67％至85％。去冬以来，全省气温又比往年高，因此蒸发量比往年大，各地土壤湿度比往年相差很远。同时，冬旱是在秋旱之后出现的，河流流量也大大减少。渭河流量比往年同期减少一半左右，泾河减少三分之二以上。陕南库塘没有蓄水。这都严重地威胁着越冬作物生长和春播。据气象部门预测，2、3月份雨量也很少，旱象仍有持续的可能。
    这种情况，决定了战胜干旱是争取今年全省第一季丰收和搞好春播的关键。因此，冬旱在去年11月刚刚露头，中共陕西省委就指示各地迅速开展冬灌运动，许多专区、县和人民公社的领导干部都上了抗旱第一线。因此，全省群众性的抗旱运动迅速地蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。从今年1月初以来，全省每天参加抗旱斗争的有两三百万人。
    在抗旱斗争中，各地人民公社都千方百计地利用一切水源，动用一切工具，力争滴水归田。同时，大力改进灌溉方法，合理经济用水，扩大冬灌面积。各地都改大畦灌为小畦灌，实行合车并流、井浇近地、渠浇远地、窖池齐用等办法，既加快了速度，又提高了质量。汉中市双泉堰灌区由于认真实行经济用水，使灌溉面积扩大了40％以上。三原县清惠渠采用顺沟灌、小畦灌等方法，大大节约了用水，一个流量平均日灌一千四百五十亩，最高达到一千六百八十亩，每亩平均灌水四十九点五立方米。
    为了尽速发挥冬修水利工程在抗旱中的作用，各地注意了工程配套，一般新修水利工程都达到了库成、渠通、地平。有40％的新修工程和大部分的整修工程都已投入灌溉。
    山西
    新华社太原9日电　同春旱作斗争的群众运动已在山西各地开展起来。晋南、晋东南、晋中、晋北地区都派出大批干部深入公社基层组织，全面发动防旱抗旱。晋南产麦区各人民公社在利用原有水利工程浇灌麦田的同时，对新修水利工程开展了“三赶”（赶春浇、赶夏浇、赶汛期）“两早”（早完工、早受益）运动，加紧抢修，力争在抗御春旱中发挥作用。闻喜县采取边修工程、边修渠、边整地、边浇地的办法，全县去冬以来兴修的能够扩大灌溉面积十万多亩的水利工程，已有85％发挥了作用。晋北繁峙县各公社一方面掀起了破冰浇地保墒活动，扩大灌溉面积；一方面交流阳明堡公社茂河灌区去年一个流量浇地十一万亩的合理用水的经验，使现有水源在防春旱中发挥最大限度的作用。各地还普遍顶凌耙地，保护墒土，防御春旱。
    山西省南起太行山、晋南平原，北至长城内外地区，去年11月份以来雪少风多，降雪量比常年少三分之一。目前全省普遍开始呈现春旱现象。运城、平陆、万荣、临汾、安泽、襄垣等县大部分田地干土层已达到一至三寸。旱地小麦部分嫩苗已经干枯，叶子变成浅绿色和黄色，严重地威胁着小麦返青生长。秋地墒情不好，也给春耕播种带来了困难。
    各地党委和人民公社都把战胜春旱作为备耕工作中的中心环节，及早地发动社员掀起以防旱抗旱为中心的“开春红”生产运动。最近，省领导部门又提出各项措施，如：摸底算账，积极扩大春浇面积；大抓工程配套、机具配套，保证适时灌溉；提前春浇，凡是有水利条件的地方立即投入春浇，尚未开冻的地区要积极准备破冰灌溉，有雪积雪，有冰积冰；全面计划用水，提高水的利用率，推广大水分散、小水集中、沟畦浅浇等灌溉办法，做到经济用水，扩大灌溉面积；以及普遍推行如像耙地保墒等一切有效的防旱抗旱措施，以促使抗旱运动进一步全面地深入地开展。
