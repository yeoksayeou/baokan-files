Xinhua News Agency reports: Public opinion in Latin American countries strongly condemns the U.S. interference plot against Cuba and warmly supports the Cuban people's struggle to defend the revolution.

    The Argentine Communist Party stated in a recent statement that "The Argentine people will regard any diplomatic, military, or economic aggression against Cuba as aggression against all the people of Latin America, and they will unite to defend themselves from aggression."

    The statement demanded that the United States stop interfering in the internal affairs of Latin American countries, first and foremost stop interfering in the internal affairs of Cuba; and stop putting pressure on the governments of Latin American countries to prevent them from establishing diplomatic and trade relations with all countries in the world, especially with socialist countries.

    Colombia's "Democracia Voz" commented on the 5th that the imperialist threat to the Cuban people "convinces us that a movement of support and solidarity with the Cuban people must be launched immediately. Through this movement, we should show the U.S. State Department that the era of treating our countries as colonies is over, and the (U.S.) Marines can no longer wantonly trample on our land today."

    The commentary emphasized, "Now, when Latin America has begun to choose its own path, the U.S. colonialists must be warned that they can never stop any nation's people from resisting aggressors, nor can they hinder the Cuban people from defeating their enemies and saving the revolution, independence, and honor of their motherland."

    The National Executive Committee of the Democratic Action Party, the ruling party of Venezuela, recently passed a resolution in Caracas supporting the Cuban Revolution.

    The resolution pointed out that some reactionary groups are currently stepping up their propaganda campaign in an attempt to undermine the sympathy of the people of Latin American countries for Cuba and its revolution. Therefore, the National Executive Committee of the Democratic Action Party believes that it is timely to emphasize support for the Cuban revolutionary regime at this time.

    The resolution stated, "For the Democratic Action Party, the fate of Cuba is our fate, the fate of Venezuela, and the fate of the Latin American people who are fighting to safeguard democracy and ultimately take control of their own destiny. Therefore, the Democratic Action Party once again firmly expresses its unwavering support for Cuba and the Cuban revolutionary regime."

    整个拉丁美洲和古巴在一起
    阿根廷共产党指出侵略古巴就是侵略全体拉丁美洲人民
    哥伦比亚“民主呼声报”表示决不许美国任意蹂躏别国
    委内瑞拉执政党通过决议坚决支持古巴革命政权的立场
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：拉丁美洲各国的公众舆论强烈谴责美国对古巴的干涉阴谋，热烈支持古巴人民保卫革命的斗争。
    阿根廷共产党在最近发表的一个声明中说，“阿根廷人民将认为，对古巴进行的外交、军事或经济侵略，就是对全体拉丁美洲人民的侵略，他们将齐心一致起来保卫自己免受侵略。”
    声明要求美国停止干涉拉丁美洲国家的内政，首先是停止干涉古巴的内政；停止对拉丁美洲国家的政府施加压力以阻止它们同世界各国特别是同社会主义国家建立外交关系和贸易关系。
    哥伦比亚“民主呼声报”在5日发表评论说，帝国主义对古巴人民的威胁“使我们确信，必须立即展开一个支持和声援古巴人民的运动。我们应该通过这个运动向美国国务院表明，把我们这些国家当作殖民地对待的时代已经过去了，（美国）海军陆战队今天不能再为所欲为地蹂躏我们的土地”。
    评论强调指出，“现在，当拉丁美洲已经开始选择自己的道路的时候，必须正告美国殖民主义者，他们决不可能阻止任何国家人民去抵抗侵略者，决不可能阻挠古巴人民战败他们的敌人，拯救他们祖国的革命、独立和荣誉”。委内瑞拉执政党民主行动党全国执行委员会最近在加拉加斯举行的会议上通过了支持古巴革命的决议。
    决议指出，有些反动集团目前正加紧展开宣传运动，企图破坏拉丁美洲各国人民对古巴及其革命的同情。因此，民主行动党全国执行委员会认为在目前强调支持古巴革命政权是适时的。
    决议说，“对民主行动党来说，古巴的命运就是我们的命运，就是委内瑞拉的命运，就是为保障民主和最终掌握自己的命运而斗争的拉丁美洲人民的命运。因此，民主行动党再一次坚决表明它坚定不移地支持古巴和古巴革命政权的立场。”
