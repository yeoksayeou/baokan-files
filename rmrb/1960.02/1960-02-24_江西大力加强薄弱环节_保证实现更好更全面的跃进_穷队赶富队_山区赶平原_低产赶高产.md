Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, February 23rd: A vigorous "Three Catch-Up" movement of poor teams catching up with rich teams, mountainous areas catching up with plains, and low yields catching up with high yields is underway in Jiangxi. In this movement, the broad masses of people's commune members are in high spirits and full of energy, continuously pushing spring production to a new high tide. At present, the preparatory work for spring plowing in all poor teams across the province has entered the ranks of the advanced; mountainous areas are seizing the opportunity to implement early rice yield-increasing measures according to local conditions, striving for grain yields to catch up with the plains this year; and more than one million commune members in various regions are transforming low-yield fields, working hard in the fields. To date, the province has transformed six million mu of low-yield fields, with an average application of over 500 dan of base fertilizer per mu, reaching or exceeding the fertilization level of high-yield fields. Communes in various areas have also established more than 50,000 cattle pens and pig farms in the low-yield fields, accumulating fertilizer locally and applying it on the spot, laying a solid foundation for high-yield and bumper harvests in low-yield fields.

In order to strive for a continued leap forward in agricultural production this year, Party committees at all levels in Jiangxi, when arranging this year's production according to the principle of taking grain as the key link and promoting an all-round leap forward, analyzed the favorable situation and weak links this year. Party committees in various areas believe there are three weak links: First, poor teams. Among the 5,100 poor teams in the province, 30% had already caught up with the rich teams last year, but the remaining 70% of the poor teams, although their production appearance has greatly changed compared with the past, have not yet caught up with the level of the rich teams; second, remote mountainous areas, where grain yields are lower due to poor natural conditions, and there is great potential for increased production that has not been realized; third, compared with high-yield fields, there are still low-yield fields in various areas. Party committees in various areas believe that grasping these three weak links and striving for the production or yields of poor teams, mountainous areas, and low-yield fields to all catch up with rich teams, plains, and high-yield fields is an important step in ensuring a continued leap forward this year. To this end, while grasping advanced and high-yield areas, various regions have launched the "Three Catch-Up" movement. In order to strengthen the leadership of this movement, Party committees at all levels across the province have recently sent 30,000 cadres to poor teams and remote mountainous areas to participate in production and lead production; Party committees at the prefectural, county, and commune levels have organized more than 100,000 cadres to go deep into the front line of production, focusing on low-yield communes and teams.

After the "Three Catch-Up" slogan was put forward, it greatly inspired the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and people. Various regions have started by mobilizing the masses, summing up experience, tapping potential, and analyzing the favorable conditions after communization and the Great Leap Forward, formulating leap forward targets, and quickly setting off a high tide of the "Three Catch-Up" movement. According to the conditions of more water and fertilizer and increased production funds this year, poor teams in Le'an, Xiajiang, Wuyuan, and Fengxin counties decided to adopt methods such as changing one season to two seasons and reclaiming wasteland to expand the planting area of early rice. At present, the good seeds required for the early rice fields of these teams are ready, and more than 600 dan of base fertilizer per mu of early rice field has been applied. In addition to determining to change all 400 mu of single-season rice to double-season rice, the Xiayang Brigade of Shishan Commune in Nanfeng County, where there are many people and little land, also organized commune members to rush to reclaim 20 mu of wasteland in two days, preparing to immediately plant sugar cane and other cash crops, and vigorously carry out mixed forestry and grain planting and increase the planting of various miscellaneous grains.

The movement of low-yield catching up with high-yield, which aims to bring about a major turnaround in low-yield fields, is even more surging and wave after wave. Hundreds of thousands of commune members in various regions are rushing to accumulate fertilizer, make fertilizer, and improve the soil, launching a major offensive against low-yield fields. In the Yichun Special District, communes have formed 10,000 expedition teams with 100,000 fighters, and are waging a great battle in remote low-yield fields. People eat in the fields, live in the fields, and work hard day and night. In Shangyou County, more than 13,000 commune members from various communes have worked hard for a month, and have now fermented more than 174,000 fertilizer piles and fertilizer cellars in more than 21,000 mu of low-yield mountain gullies, preparing several times more fertilizer for low-yield fields than last year. In Pingxiang County, more than 40,000 members of professional teams from various communes have adopted four major measures according to the different soil qualities of low-yield fields: deep plowing, opening ditches to drain cold water, selecting and replacing foreign soil, and increasing fertilizer application, and have transformed more than 110,000 mu of low-yield fields. In Xinfeng County in the mountainous area of southern Jiangxi, in response to the characteristics of high mountains and cold water, communes and teams have built lime kilns to greatly increase the application of warm lime fertilizer in low-yield fields. In order to establish a banner for low-yield catching up with high-yield, many regions have also established high-yield experimental fields and experimental slopes in low-yield fields.

In the "Three Catch-Up" movement, people's communes in various regions have promoted the communist style, with the advanced helping the backward and the high-yield areas helping the low-yield areas, carrying out large-scale cooperation in manpower and material resources. Many communes and teams in the plains areas, in order to help communes and teams in mountainous areas solve the difficulties of insufficient labor force to change the appearance of low yields, have taken the initiative to sign long-term labor cooperation contracts with communes in mountainous areas. Many wealthy teams have regarded the difficulties of poor teams in production as their own, and actively helped them catch up with themselves. The Zhuxi Brigade, a poor team in Luochang Commune in Fengxin County, was unable to complete the new reservoir due to a lack of labor. All 27 brigades in the commune immediately transferred 700 commune members to help the Zhuxi Brigade, and rushed to complete the reservoir in two days. Under the slogan of "Rich teams help poor teams, one team's difficulties are supported by the whole commune," the Bayi Commune in Nanchang County has advanced 50,000 yuan in production funds to five poor teams, including Nandeng and Danxi, which lack funds for spring plowing, and helped the Danxi Brigade repair and add more than 4,000 pieces of spring plowing farm implements such as plows and harrows.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, February 23rd: The broad masses of people's commune members in the low-yield wheat areas of Henan Province have made up their minds to strive for high wheat yields this year and change the appearance of low yields. Now, after careful management and cultivation since winter, with added water and fertilizer, the wheat fields in these areas have green and lush wheat seedlings, strong and vigorous, and growing better than in any previous year.

In Henan Province, there are about 15 million mu of low-yield wheat fields distributed in mountainous areas, hilly areas, saline-alkali low-lying areas, and the Yellow River beach areas. In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the realization of people's communization, with the development of agricultural basic construction such as water conservancy, forestry, and deep plowing of land, the appearance of these low-yield areas has begun to change, and many areas have seen examples of low-yield turning into high-yield. In order to strive for a continued leap forward in agricultural production this year, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed various regions to focus on low-yield areas and eliminate low-yield fields while grasping high-yield areas and bumper harvest areas, striving for balanced and high yields in every area, as an important measure to implement taking grain as the key link and ensuring a bumper wheat harvest this year. According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, various low-yield areas have launched a vigorous competition movement since the sowing of wheat last year to catch up with early sowing from late sowing, mountainous areas catch up with plains, distant land catch up with nearby land, lean land catch up with fertile land, and third-class seedlings catch up with first-class seedlings.

Adapting to local conditions and vigorously carrying out basic farmland construction is a major method for low-yield areas to strive for high yields. In the hilly and mountainous areas, great efforts are being made to divert water to the hills, open up water sources, and erect aerial cableways to solve the difficulty of transporting fertilizer. Since last winter, saline-alkali low-lying areas have launched a water conservancy construction movement centered on large-scale river network construction, and have carried out work such as suppressing alkali, washing alkali, and improving the soil. In Minquan County, the old course of the Yellow River in eastern Henan, great efforts have been made to carry out basic farmland construction such as digging canals in the past boundless sandy wasteland. Now, the canals in these areas are crisscrossed, able to drain and irrigate, and the wheat sown for the first time last autumn is growing very vigorously, and the barren sand is beginning to turn into fertile land.

"Establish bumper harvest areas wherever there is low yield" is the bold slogan of the masses in low-yield areas to resolve to remove the low-yield label. Now, this slogan has been transformed into practical action. The Nanle County Committee of the Communist Party of China separately selected four areas with different soil qualities, namely, two-mixed soil, green sandy land, silt land, and saline-alkali land, and established four wheat bumper harvest areas, and four secretaries of the County Party Committee were assigned to be responsible for the leadership, determined to create the experience of high-yield and bumper harvest to guide the movement of low-yield catching up with high-yield in the county.

The areas where counties intersect were the weakest link in production leadership in the past. In this year's movement of low-yield wheat catching up with high-yield, various regions have strengthened leadership in these areas. In the area where Nanyang and Fangcheng counties intersect, the wheat yield per mu has only been more than 100 jin in previous years. When wheat was sown last year, the Nanyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China established a million-mu bumper harvest area in the area where these two counties intersect, and established a bumper harvest area command, leading the communes and teams in the bumper harvest area in the two counties to deep plow all 1.07 million mu of wheat fields to a depth of eight inches to one foot, apply more than 20 carts of base fertilizer per mu, and comprehensively carry out water conservancy construction centered on transforming low-lying land, building large reservoirs and canals, and realizing systematization of drainage and irrigation and vehicle-based fertilizer transportation. Now, the wheat seedlings in the local 1.07 million mu of wheat are generally growing well.

    江西大力加强薄弱环节  保证实现更好更全面的跃进
    穷队赶富队  山区赶平原  低产赶高产
    三万干部下放穷队和偏僻山区，十多万干部深入生产第一线重点抓低产社、队
    河南小麦低产区人民公社立下雄心大志，力争高产丰收改变低产面貌
    新华社南昌23日电　江西各地掀起了轰轰烈烈的穷队赶富队、山区赶平原、低产赶高产的“三赶”运动。在这个运动中，广大人民公社社员意气风发，干劲冲天，把春季生产不断地推向新高潮。现在，全省穷队各项备耕工作都跨入了先进行列；山区正因地制宜地狠抓早稻增产措施，力争今年粮食赶上平原；各地改造低产田的一百多万社员，正在田间大干特干。到目前为止，全省已经改造低产田六百万亩，平均每亩田已施底肥五百担以上，赶上或超过了高产田的施肥水平。各地公社还在低产田头建立了牛栏、养猪场五万多个，就地积肥，就地施肥，为低产田高产丰收打下了雄厚的基础。
    为了争取今年农业生产继续跃进，江西各地各级党委根据以粮为纲全面跃进的方针安排今年生产时，都分析了今年的有利形势和薄弱环节。各地党委认为薄弱环节有三：第一是穷队。全省五千一百个穷队，去年已有30％赶上了富队，其余70％的穷队虽然生产面貌比过去有了很大改变，但还未赶上富队水平；第二是偏僻山区，这些地区因为自然条件差，粮食产量较低，有很大的增产潜力没有发挥出来；第三是各地与高产田相比，还普遍有低产田存在。各地党委认为，抓紧这三个薄弱环节，力争穷队、山区和低产田的生产或产量，全部赶上富队、平原和高产田，是保证今年继续跃进的重要一着。为此，各地在抓先进、高产地区的同时，开展了“三赶”运动。为了加强这一运动的领导，全省各级党委最近下放了三万名干部到穷队、偏僻山区参加生产、领导生产；各地委、县委和公社党委组织了十多万干部深入生产第一线，重点抓低产社、队。
    “三赶”口号提出后，大大鼓舞了广大干部和群众的干劲。各地都从发动群众、总结经验、挖掘潜力和分析公社化、大跃进以后的有利条件入手，订出跃进指标，迅速掀起了“三赶”高潮。乐安、峡江、婺源、奉新四个县的穷队，根据今年水肥多、生产资金增加等条件，决定采取一季改两季和开荒等办法，扩大早稻种植面积。现在，这些队的早稻田所需良种都已准备就绪，每亩早稻田已经下基肥六百多担。人多田少的南丰县市山公社下阳大队除确定把四百亩单季稻全部改种成双季稻以外，还组织社员突击两天，开垦荒地二十亩，准备立即种上甘蔗等经济作物，并大搞林、粮混作，增种各种杂粮。
    要低产田大翻身的低产赶高产的运动，更是汹涌澎湃，一浪高过一浪。各地成千上万的社员正在突击积肥、造肥、改良土壤，向低产田大举进军。宜春专区各公社组成万个远征队，十万战斗员，大战边远低产田。人们吃在田间、住在田间，披星戴月的苦战。上犹县各公社一万三千多名社员，大干一个月，现在已经在二万一千多亩山坑低产田中，沤制了十七万四千多个肥堆、肥窖，为低产田准备了比去年多几倍的肥料。萍乡县各公社四万多人的专业队，针对低产田的不同土质分别采取深耕、开沟排冷水、挑换客土、增施肥料四大措施，已改造低产田十一万多亩。赣南山区的信丰县，针对当地山高水冷的特点，社社、队队大建石灰窑，在低产田里大量增施暖性的石灰肥。许多地区为了树立低产赶高产的旗帜，还在低产田里建立了高额丰产试验田、试验坂。
    各地人民公社在“三赶”运动中，发扬共产主义风格，先进帮后进，高产区帮低产区，开展了人力、物力大协作。许多平原地区的社、队，为了帮助山区社、队解决改变低产面貌劳动力不足的困难，主动与山区社订立了长期劳力协作合同。许多富裕队都把穷队生产上的一些困难当作自己的困难，主动地帮助它们赶上自己。奉新县罗场公社的穷队竹溪大队，由于劳力少，新建的水库迟迟不能完工。全社二十七个大队立即抽调了七百名社员帮助竹溪大队，突击两天把水库建成。南昌县八一公社在“富队帮穷队，一队困难全社支援”的口号下，给春耕生产资金不足的南邓、淡溪等五个穷队，垫出了五万元的生产资金，帮助淡溪大队修理和添置了急需的犁耙等春耕农具四千多件。
    新华社郑州23日电　河南小麦低产区的广大人民公社社员立下雄心大志，力争今年小麦高产，改变低产面貌。现在这些地区的麦田，经过入冬以来的精心管理培育，加水加肥，麦苗青葱茂密，棵棵茁壮，长得比以往任何一年都好。
    河南省分布在山区、丘陵地区、盐碱低洼地区和黄河滩区的低产麦田约一千五百万亩。近几年来特别是从1958年大跃进和实现人民公社化以后，随着水利、林业、深翻土地等农业基本建设的发展，这些低产区的面貌已经开始改观，不少地区出现了低产变高产的范例。为了争取今年农业生产继续跃进，中共河南省委指示各地在大抓高产区、丰产方的同时，应狠抓低产区，消灭低产田，力争块块均衡高产，作为贯彻以粮为纲、确保今年小麦丰收的一项重要措施。根据省委指示，各个低产区从去年小麦播种开始，就开展了蓬蓬勃勃的晚茬赶早茬、山区赶平原、远地赶近地、瘦地赶肥地、三类苗赶一类苗的竞赛运动。
    因地制宜，大搞农田基本建设，是低产区力争高产的一项主要办法。在丘陵山区，都大搞引水上岗、开辟水源和架设空中索道解决运肥的困难。盐碱低洼地区从去冬以来就开展了以大搞河网化为中心的水利建设运动，并且进行了压碱、洗碱和改良土壤等工作。豫东黄河故道的民权县，在过去一望无边的沙荒地里，大搞挖渠等农田基本建设。现在，这些地里渠道纵横，能排能灌，去秋第一次种下的小麦长得十分旺盛，荒沙开始变为良田。
    “哪里低产就在那里建立丰产方”，是低产地区群众决心摘掉低产帽子的豪迈口号。现在，这一口号已经变成实际行动，中共南乐县委分别选择了两合土、青沙地、淤地和盐碱地四种土质不同的地区，建立了四个小麦丰产方，并由县委四个书记分工负责领导，决心创造出高产丰收的经验，指导全县低产赶高产的运动。
    县与县交界的地区是过去生产领导最薄弱的环节。在今年小麦低产赶高产运动中，各地都对这类地区加强了领导。南阳、方城两县交界地区，历年小麦亩产量只有一百多斤。去年种麦时，中共南阳地委在这两个县交界地区建立了一个百万亩丰产方，成立了丰产方指挥部，领导两县丰产方内的社、队把一百零七万亩麦田全部深翻八寸到一尺，每亩施足底肥二十多车，并且全面开展以改造洼地为中心的水利建设运动，大建水库和渠道，实现了排灌系统化，运肥车子化。现在，当地一百零七万亩小麦的麦苗普遍生长良好。
