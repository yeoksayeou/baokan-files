Returning Every Drop to the Field, Eliminating Spring Drought
Shijiazhuang Prefecture Promotes the Water Usage Experience of Gaocheng Irrigation District

Tianjin, February 12 (reporting from this newspaper) The Shijiazhuang Prefecture in Hebei Province is summarizing and promoting the experience of the Shijin Canal Gaocheng Irrigation District in skillfully grasping the five links of returning every drop to the field, achieving an average of over 1,000 mu of land irrigated per flow per day and night, and is facing and eliminating the spring drought head-on. By February 8th, more than 4 million mu of barren land had been irrigated, more than doubling the speed compared to the same period last year, creating favorable conditions for timely spring sowing.

The Gaocheng Irrigation District has three benefiting communes, with an irrigation area of 120,000 mu. In the past, due to the failure of management work to keep up, the effective utilization rate of the entire irrigation district was only 40%. In view of this situation, the Gaocheng County Party Committee organized the communes and production teams to cooperate with the water conservancy departments to mobilize the masses to summarize the benefits of skillful water use.

This irrigation district, in its water use management, has firmly grasped five key links since the spring of last year.

First, repair the canals. The 13-kilometer-long main canal was lined with cement. The bottoms of the eleven branch canals were laid and compacted with 30% lime and 70% yellow earth, and the bottoms of the branch and capillary canals were also compacted. In order to speed up the flow of water, before each release of water, the main, branch, branch, and capillary canals were universally dredged to eliminate weeds and remove various obstacles.

Second, fully utilize the idle water in autumn and winter to advance the spring irrigation tasks as much as possible to autumn and winter irrigation. Last autumn, a campaign of autumn and winter irrigation was launched here. More than 47,000 mu of the 50,000 mu of barren land in the entire irrigation district was irrigated in autumn and winter, preserving the moisture, and sowing could be carried out without watering in the spring. In this way, all the spring water can be used to irrigate wheat.

Third, unify the planning of canals. The existing large and small canals that could be utilized were straightened, and those that could not be utilized were cancelled, so that the branch, branch, and capillary canals were evenly distributed, forming a uniformly-sized irrigation network.

Fourth, implement the regionalization of crop planting. As far as possible, the same type of crops are planted next to each canal, which saves labor and animal power for cultivation, and also saves the loss of canal water returning and “running ditches.” At the same time, on the basis of the regionalization of crop planting, unified planning and quantitative water allocation are carried out in accordance with the needs, seasons, and soil conditions of the crops, and they are watered in turn.

Fifth, in order to improve the utilization rate of water, under the leadership of the Shijin Canal Gaocheng Irrigation District Management Office, each commune established a canal committee to unify leadership, assign responsibility to sections, and provide water quantitatively. And covenants for saving water were established. Through skillfully grasping the five links, this irrigation district achieved an average of 1,040 mu of land irrigated per flow per day and night, about double that of ordinary canals.

The Shijiazhuang Prefectural Party Committee believes that the experience of the Gaocheng Irrigation District is of great significance for expanding the irrigated area and preventing spring drought, and called on all localities to seriously study and promote the experience of this irrigation district.

    滴水归田　消灭春旱
    石家庄专区推广藁城灌区用水经验
    本报天津12日电　河北省石家庄专区，总结推广石津渠藁城灌区巧抓五环滴水归田，平均一个流量一昼夜浇地一千多亩的经验，迎头消灭春旱。到2月8日，已浇白地四百多万亩，比去年同期加快一倍多，给适时春播创造了有利条件。
    藁城灌区共有三个受益社，灌溉面积十二万亩。过去由于管理工作赶不上去，全灌区有效利用率只达40％。根据这种情况，中共藁城县委组织公社、生产队协同水利部门，发动广大群众总结了巧用水的好处。
    这个灌区在用水管理中，从去年春天开始，狠狠的抓住了五个环节。
    第一，整修渠道。对十三公里长的大干渠，使用了水泥衬砌。对十一条支渠都用三成石灰、七成黄土铺底打实，对斗渠、毛渠的渠底也都进行了夯实。为加快水的流速，在每次放水以前，还对干、支、斗、毛渠，普遍进行了清淤，消灭杂草，清除各种障碍物。
    第二，充分利用秋冬季闲水，把春季的灌溉任务，尽可能提前到秋冬灌溉。去年秋后，这里就掀起了秋冬灌地运动。全灌区的五万多亩白地，秋、冬灌了四万七千多亩，保好了墒，春天不再浇水就可播种。这样春水可以全部用来灌溉小麦。
    第三，统一规划渠道。对现有能利用的大小渠道进行了截弯取直，不能利用的就取消，使支、斗、毛渠分布均匀，形成了规格统一的灌溉网。
    第四，实行了作物种植区域化。每一条渠的旁边都尽可能种植同类的作物，这样既节约耕作的劳力、畜力，又节约了渠水的往返“跑沟”的损失。同时，在作物种植区域化的基础上，根据农作物的需要、季度、土壤等情况，统一规划，定量配水，依次轮浇。
    第五，为提高水的利用率，在石津渠藁城灌区管理所领导下，每个公社建立了渠道委员会，统一领导，分段包干，定量供水。并且建立了节约用水的公约。通过巧抓五环，这个灌区平均一个流量一昼夜浇地达一千零四十亩，比一般渠道提高一倍左右。
    中共石家庄地委认为藁城灌区的经验，对于扩大浇地面积，预防春旱具有很重要的意义，号召各地认真学习推广这个灌区的经验。
