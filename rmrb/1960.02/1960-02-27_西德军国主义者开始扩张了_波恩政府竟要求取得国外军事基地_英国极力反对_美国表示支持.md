West German Militarists Begin to Expand
Bonn Government Actually Demands Foreign Military Bases
Britain Vigorously Opposes; United States Expresses Support

(Dispatch from this newspaper) According to Western news agencies, the West German Adenauer government, in order to facilitate the West German Defense Forces' training for a preparatory atomic war, has negotiated with the Franco government, demanding the establishment of a West German missile training base and missile launch practice range in Spain. This is yet another demonstration of the increasingly blatant ambitions of West German militarism for expansion.

On February 24, West German Defense Minister Strauss openly stated that West German troops want to set up training locations and military supply bases in the entire Iberian Peninsula, including Spain. The British "News Chronicle" reported that this means that a portion of West German troops will conduct missile exercises and launches toward the Atlantic without being subject to NATO control.

But West German militarists are not satisfied with this. West German Defense Minister Strauss is still clamoring that West German troops need more training locations and military supply bases. According to United Press International, West Germany recently also raised "demands to Portugal, Turkey, France and Italy for the establishment of training facilities for the West German armed forces on their territories." At the same time, West German Air Force Inspector and former Nazi General Kammhuber even openly declared that he wants to station combat units of the Federal Air Force in Britain. The British "Empire News" reported this news saying: "This shocking news will mean that those who once bombed Britain will now be stationed here." In fact, the West German Defense Forces have already established ammunition supply bases in France, Italy, Belgium, and Denmark in Northern Europe.

The West German conspiracy to demand military hegemony is not limited to this. The American "Stars and Stripes" said not long ago: "West Germany is currently demanding more senior military positions within NATO as the 'price' for increasing its financial and military contributions to the Atlantic Alliance," in order to make its position in the Atlantic bloc "surpass its current junior partner status." Now West Germany is trying its best to seize the NATO Northern European military command.

The expansionist ambitions of West German militarist elements cannot but arouse people's vigilance. Because "during the Spanish Civil War, Hitler's army used Spain to test its combat power during World War II" (Associated Press). People know that Franco's dictatorial rule in Spain was established by Hitler with bayonets, and Franco's Spain was an accomplice of fascist Germany during World War II. Since the war, Hitler's Nazi elements have been actively operating under Franco's protection. It is precisely because of this close relationship between Spain and militarist Germany that West German Defense Minister Strauss openly stated when announcing this West German conspiracy that the establishment of a West German military base in Spain "is completely natural." What is particularly noteworthy is that the excuse used by West Germany for establishing a military base in Spain is exactly the same as Hitler's theory of "living space": West Germany has limited land, so its troops need a larger development range. These facts show that the Western countries' consistent post-war policy of rearming West Germany is beginning to backfire on them. Reuters said that this action by West Germany "will certainly arouse old doubts about the motives of the Germans, not only in Britain but also in other European countries." The British government has expressed "strong opposition" to this proposition of West Germany. Agence France-Presse said that Macmillan, when meeting with Krone, chairman of the parliamentary group of the West German Christian Democratic Union, stated that "he does not agree with West German actions." British newspapers of all tendencies have severely criticized West Germany. The "Times" called this West German plan "the most stupid thing." It is reported that British spokespersons are demanding that West Germany "should first raise the issue of the base within the NATO framework" in order to control West German actions. At present, West Germany is trying to cover things up on the one hand, and on the other hand, Strauss is "particularly angry" at the attacks by the British newspapers. At the same time, West Germany is asking the United States to publicly support West Germany. However, the attitude of the United States, on the one hand, maintains "caution" and "silence," while on the other hand, a telegram from the United States Information Service reported that a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said: We know that Germany needs air force training facilities, and I understand that various possibilities are being considered informally. The Associated Press also said: Americans, especially Allied Supreme Commander General Norstad, are sympathetic to Germany's (West Germany's) supply problems from a military point of view.

### 西德军国主义者开始扩张了  波恩政府竟要求取得国外军事基地  英国极力反对　美国表示支持

    西德军国主义者开始扩张了
    波恩政府竟要求取得国外军事基地
    英国极力反对　美国表示支持
    本报讯　据西方通讯社报道，西德阿登纳政府为了便于西德国防军进行准备原子战争的训练，已经同佛朗哥政府谈判，要求在西班牙建立西德导弹训练基地和导弹发射演习场。这是西德军国主义扩张野心日益露骨的又一次证明。
    2月24日西德国防部长施特劳斯公开表示，西德军队要在包括西班牙在内的伊比利亚半岛全区设立训练地点和军事供应基地。英国“新闻纪事报”报道说，这意味着西德的一部分军队将在不受北大西洋公约组织管辖的情况下向大西洋进行导弹的演习发射。
    但是西德军国主义者并不以此为满足。西德国防部长施特劳斯还在叫嚣：西德部队需要更多的训练地点和军事供应基地。据合众国际社报道，最近西德还向葡萄牙、土耳其、法国和意大利提出了“在它们的领土上为西德的武装部队建立训练设施的要求。”同时，西德空军督察、前纳粹将军卡姆胡贝尔更公然宣称要把联邦空军的作战单位驻扎在英国。英国“帝国新闻”在报道这则消息时说：“这个惊人的新闻将意味着，那些一度曾经轰炸英国的人，现在要驻扎在这里。”事实上，西德国防军早已在法国、意大利、比利时、北欧的丹麦建立起军火供应基地。
    西德要求军事霸权的阴谋还不仅限于此。美国“明星报”在不久前曾这样说：“西德目前正要求在北大西洋公约组织里面担任更多的高级军事职位，作为增加它对大西洋联盟的财政和军事贡献的‘代价’”，以便使它在北大西洋集团中的地位“超过它目前的小伙伴地位”。现在西德正竭力要把北大西洋集团北欧军事指挥权抓在自己手里。
    西德军国主义分子这种扩张野心不能不引起人们的警惕。因为“在西班牙内战时，希特勒的军队利用西班牙来考验它在第二次世界大战时的战斗力量”（美联社）。人们知道，佛朗哥对西班牙的独裁统治是希特勒用刺刀扶植起来的，而佛朗哥西班牙在第二次世界大战时期曾经是法西斯德国的帮凶。战后以来，希特勒纳粹分子一直在佛朗哥卵翼下积极进行活动。正是由于西班牙同军国主义德国的这种密切关系，西德国防部长施特劳斯在宣布西德的这一阴谋时公开表示，西德在西班牙建立军事基地“那是完全自然的”。特别值得注意的是，西德在西班牙设立军事基地所用的借口也同希特勒的“生存空间”理论一模一样：西德的地域有限，因而它的军队需要更大的发展范围。这些事实说明，西方国家战后一贯执行的重新武装西德的政策正在开始使它们自食恶果。路透社说，西德的这一行动“肯定会引起不仅是英国，而且还有欧洲的其他国家对德国人的动机的旧有疑虑。”英国政府对西德的这种主张已表示“极力反对”。法新社说，麦克米伦在接见西德基督教民主联盟议会党团主席克罗内时表示“他不同意西德的行动”。各种倾向的英国报纸都猛烈抨击西德。“泰晤士报”把西德这个计划称为“最愚蠢的事情”。据报道，英国发言人正要求西德“应首先在北大西洋集团范围内提出基地问题”，以利于控制西德行动。目前西德一方面企图把事情掩盖起来，另一方面施特劳斯对英国报纸的抨击“特别感到生气”。同时西德正在要求美国公开支持西德。但是美国的态度一方面保持“谨慎”、
  “缄然”，而另一方面美国新闻处的一则电讯报道美国国务院发言人的话说：我们知道德国需要空军训练设施，我了解正在通过非正式途径考虑各种可能性。美联社也说：美国人，特别是盟军最高司令诺斯塔德将军从军事角度考虑出发，是同情德国（西德）的供应问题的。
