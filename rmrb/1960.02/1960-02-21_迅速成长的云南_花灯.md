The Yunnan "Flower Lantern" is Rapidly Growing
Yang Qi

Yunnan is a rich ocean of multi-ethnic art. Among the countless brilliant art treasures, there is a shining pearl - the Han Chinese "Flower Lantern."

The beautiful and moving nature of Yunnan folk songs has long been recognized by the broad masses. The "Flower Lantern" uses dramatic plots to more centrally highlight the artistic beauty of Yunnan Han folk songs and ditties. In the past few years, some Flower Lantern song and dance performances, such as "Ten Sisters," "Camellia Praise," and "Great Tea Mountain," have appeared on the stage in Beijing. However, this performance by the Yunnan Flower Lantern Troupe in Beijing can be considered as the first time Beijing audiences have fully understood it as a local opera with a relatively long history.

The foundation of Yunnan Flower Lantern Opera is rich and colorful folk songs and ditties. It has been formed as a folk opera integrated with poetry, music, and dance for about one hundred and sixty or seventy years. It has deep connections with Yuan Dynasty music drama and Ming and Qing Dynasty opera. In the traditional repertoire, works such as "Killing the Dog to Advise Her Husband," "Zhu Maichen Divorces His Wife," "Yingying's Farewell," "Teasing Liu Cui," "White Peony Sells Medicine," "Recognizing Mother by the Well," and "Mending the Crock" all come from Yuan Dynasty music drama. Also, "Zhang San Borrows Boots," "Borrowing Relatives to Marry," "Fishing," and "Beating Date Branches" are the same as the repertoire from the mid-Qing Dynasty. Judging from the names of the musical tunes, such as "Beating Date Branches," "Inverted Transport of Paste," "Hanging Branches," "Silver Button Thread," and "Crying to Heaven," they are also the same as the names of ditties from the Ming and Qing Dynasties. However, this only shows that its formation history is relatively long. If we look at the fact that more of its repertoire reflects the life of rural people in Yunnan, and its strong Yunnan folk song and ditty temperament and color in music, it is entirely a local opera created by the working people of Yunnan. Up to now, a large part of it is still widely circulated among the people as song and dance performances and solo singing.

Because the Flower Lantern expresses the thoughts and feelings of the working people, it suffered from the devastation of the ruling class and the exclusion and contempt of the upper classes of the old society for a long time before liberation. Therefore, it could only circulate in rural areas as an amateur art. After liberation, thanks to the attention and active support of the Party and cultural departments, the Flower Lantern art has greatly developed. More than twenty professional Flower Lantern troupes have been established, and all professional cultural troupes in special areas and autonomous prefectures also frequently perform Flower Lantern Opera. Flower Lantern art workers have implemented the Party's literary and artistic guidelines and policies, vigorously explored and sorted out traditional repertoire and music, and produced a batch of excellent repertoire. Under the direct leadership of the Party, they have also overcome difficulties in expressing modern life and produced many relatively good repertoire that can be retained. The development of amateur Flower Lantern art is unprecedented in the past one or two hundred years. In carrying out cultural and recreational activities and coordinating with central work for publicity, all ethnic minority areas have used the lively Flower Lantern form. Now it has become an art form universally loved by the people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan, and a powerful weapon for quickly reflecting the people's struggle life and publicizing the Party's ideas and policies.

This time, the Yunnan Flower Lantern Troupe has brought a batch of representative traditional repertoire and the newly created large-scale modern repertoire "Ilihan."

In the traditional repertoire, we see that Flower Lantern art workers have carried out creative work in accordance with Chairman Mao's principle of "making the old serve the new." For example, "Visiting the Sworn Sister" was originally "Abducting the Sworn Sister," and there were some unhealthy impurities in its content and performance. After careful processing, it has become a short play praising steadfast love. The same is true for "Disturbing the Ferry" and "Watching the Vegetable Garden." Some creative processing has also been carried out in the music according to new requirements. For example, in "Visiting the Sworn Sister," the original tune "Jishengcao" has been appropriately adapted to better express the thoughts and emotions of the characters in the play. In the Flower Lantern song and dance programs, there are also many creations in dance and performance.

The task of developing the Flower Lantern into a relatively complete theatrical art is quite arduous. This historical task falls on the current group of Flower Lantern art workers who are very young in artistic cultivation and mastery of traditional art. To enable Flower Lantern Opera to perfectly express modern life, the most important key is to dramatize Flower Lantern music on the basis of tradition. Flower Lantern music has a rich variety of tunes (it is said that seven or eight hundred have now been excavated), but their common feature is that they are very lyrical and have weak dramatic qualities. The vast majority have the character of folk songs and ditties, and there is a particular lack of basic rhythmic patterns and tunes that express different characters and different emotions. At the same time, there is a lack of percussion music, which plays an important role in opera. In the past seven or eight years, Flower Lantern art workers have conducted very arduous explorations and have also taken detours. However, under the direct guidance of the Party, they have embarked on a correct path. Therefore, they have created a batch of relatively excellent repertoire that expresses the struggle life of the people. From the large-scale repertoire "Ilihan," which expresses the struggle life of the Dai people and is performed in Beijing this time, we can see the trajectory of the development process from a traditional small opera to a theatrical art that already has relatively rich expressive power.

I really like "Ilihan," a drama full of drama, with national style and local characteristics. It basically reflects the Dai people's sharp struggle against the ruling class under the leadership of the Party in the early days of liberation and achieved victory. It shows that the complete liberation of ethnic minorities must be carried out under the leadership of the Party's class struggle, which has been proven by the development history of various ethnic minorities in Yunnan over the past ten years. The artistic achievements of this play, I think, are first of all that its music retains the traditional style of the Flower Lantern on the one hand, and strengthens the lyricism of the Flower Lantern music; on the other hand, it has made great efforts to dramatize the Flower Lantern tunes and has achieved results. For example, in the fourth scene, Ilihan's long passage of singing in the forest after her father's death is adapted from "Golden Button Thread." The original tune cannot express Ilihan's strong emotions of hatred and grief. The adapter added tones that were not in the original tune, which made the rhythm have a strong change. Therefore, it can more fully express Ilihan's excited emotions. At the same time, this play uses percussion music that the Flower Lantern did not have, and learns from the gongs and drums of Beijing opera, which also has commendable experience; although some places are relatively stiff and disjointed, this is inevitable. Another problem is the dramatization of the singing. Shi Baofeng, who plays the heroine, is a talented young actress. Her voice has a beautiful timbre and can also express delicate emotions. However, in some places, she has not yet gotten rid of the restraint of folk song singing. Even so, the Ilihan she plays is quite successful and touching. Other actors, such as those playing Yan Wen, Boyihan, and Babolong, have different degrees of creation. However, the actors in the entire play, whether in singing or performance, still need to make further efforts to better inherit the tradition of the Flower Lantern and learn from the strengths of other fraternal operas. What urgently needs to be solved at present is the problem of singing for male roles, because this is related to the shaping of the character image. To completely solve this problem requires the joint efforts of musicians and actors.

The Yunnan Flower Lantern Troupe was only formally established in 1954. Its members are all young students and peasants. Before joining the troupe, they were only Flower Lantern enthusiasts. There were very few professional literary and artistic workers, and even fewer veteran artists. Judging from this situation, it is very commendable that they have been able to achieve such good results. At the same time, it also shows the decisive role of the Party and Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought in the development of Flower Lantern art.

    迅速成长的云南“花灯”
    杨琦
    云南是一个多民族艺术蕴藏丰富的海洋。在无数绚丽灿烂的艺术珍宝中，有一颗闪光的珍珠——汉族的“花灯”。
    云南民歌的优美动人早已为广大群众所承认。“花灯”把云南汉族民歌和小调所具有的艺术上的美通过戏剧情节更加集中地突现出来了。过去几年中，北京的舞台上出现过一些花灯的歌舞表演，如“十大姐”、“山茶赞”、“大茶山”；作为一个有较长历史的地方剧种让北京观众完整地认识它，要算是这一次云南花灯剧团的来京演出。
    云南花灯剧的基础是丰富多彩的民歌、小调，它形成为一种和诗歌、音乐、舞蹈结合为一体的民间戏曲已经有一百六、七十年的历史。它和元曲、明清戏曲有着很深的关系。在传统剧目中，像“杀狗劝夫”、“朱买臣休妻”、“莺莺饯别”、“戏柳翠”、“白牡丹卖药”、“井边认母”、“大补缸”等都来自元曲。又如“张三借靴”、“借亲配”、“打渔”、“打枣竿”等与清代中叶的剧目相同。从音乐曲调的名称来看，如“打枣竿”、“倒搬浆”、“挂枝儿”、“银纽丝”、“哭皇天”等和明清时代的小曲曲名也相同。但是，这只能说明它形成的历史比较久远。如果从它更多的剧目所反映的都是云南农村人民的生活，以及音乐上的强烈的云南民歌小调的气质和色彩来看，完全是云南劳动人民自己创造出来的一种地方小戏。到现在为止，有很大一部分还作为歌舞表演和单独的演唱广泛流传在人民中间。
    由于花灯所表现的是劳动人民的思想感情，解放前很长时期受到统治阶级的摧残和旧社会上层人士的排斥和轻视，因而只能作为一种业余艺术在农村流传。解放后，由于党和文化部门的重视和积极扶持，花灯艺术有了很大的发展；建立了二十几个专业的花灯剧团，所有专区和自治州的专业文工团也都经常演出花灯剧。花灯艺术工作者执行了党的文艺方针和政策，对传统剧目和音乐进行了大力的挖掘和整理，搞出了一批优秀的剧目；对于表现现代生活，也在党的直接领导下克服了困难，搞出许多比较好的保留剧目。业余花灯艺术的发展更是过去一、二百年所未有的，各民族地区在进行文娱活动和配合中心工作进行宣传中，都利用花灯这种生动活泼的形式。现在它已经成为云南各族人民普遍热爱的艺术形式，成为迅速反映人民群众斗争生活、宣传党的思想和政策的有力武器。
    这次，云南花灯剧团带来一批有代表性的传统剧目和新创造的大型现代剧目“依莱汗”。
    在传统剧目中，我们看到花灯艺术工作按照毛主席的“推陈出新”的方针，进行了创造性的工作。比如“探干妹”原来是“拐干妹”，在内容上和表演上都有一些不健康的杂质，经过了精心的加工，使它成一个歌颂坚贞爱情的短剧。又如“闹渡”、“看菜园”也是这样。在音乐上也根据新的要求进行了一些创造性的加工，比如在“探干妹”中把原来的曲牌“寄生草”加以适当的改编，就更适于表现剧中人的思想情绪。在花灯的歌舞节目中，舞蹈和表演上也有不少创造。
    把花灯发展成一种比较完整的剧场艺术的任务是相当艰巨的，这个历史任务就落在目前一批在艺术修养和掌握传统艺术都是很年轻的花灯艺术工作者身上。要使花灯剧能完善地表现现代生活，最重要的关键是在传统的基础上使花灯音乐戏剧化。花灯音乐曲调很丰富（据说现在已挖掘出七、八百个），但是它共同的特点是抒情性很强，戏剧性很弱；绝大多数带有民歌小调的性格，特别缺乏表现不同人物和不同情感的基本板头和曲牌，同时也缺乏在戏曲中起着重要作用的打击乐。七、八年来花灯艺术工作者进行了十分艰苦的探索，也走过弯路。但是在党的直接教导下，他们走上了一条正确的道路。因此，创造了一批表现人民群众斗争生活的比较优秀的剧目。从这次来京演出的表现傣族人民斗争生活的大型剧目“依莱汗”，就可以看到从传统小戏发展为已具有比较丰富的表现力的剧场艺术的发展过程的轨迹。
    我非常喜欢“依莱汗”这部充满了戏剧性的、富有民族风格和地方色彩的戏剧。它基本上反映出傣族人民解放初期在党的领导下向统治阶级进行了尖锐的斗争并取得了胜利。说明了少数民族的彻底解放必须在党的领导下进行阶级斗争，这是为云南各少数民族十年来的发展历史所证明的。这部戏在艺术上的成就，我认为首先是它的音乐一方面保留了花灯的传统风格，并且加强了花灯音乐的抒情性；另一方面在使花灯曲调戏剧化方面作了很大的努力，取得成效。比如第四场，依莱汗于父亲死后在森林的一大段唱腔是根据“金纽丝”改编，原来的曲调是不能表达依莱汗那种仇恨和悲痛交集的强烈的情绪的。改编者添加了原曲所没有的音调，使节奏有了强烈的变化。因此，能够较充分地表现依莱汗的激动的情感。同时，这部戏使用了花灯所没有的打击乐，借鉴了京戏的锣鼓点，也有值得肯定的经验；虽然有些地方比较生硬、不连贯，不过这是难免的。另外一个问题就是唱腔的戏剧化。扮演女主角的史宝凤是一位有才能的青年演员。她的声音的音色很美，也能表现细致的感情，可是，在有些地方还没有脱离民歌演唱的拘束。虽然如此，整个看来她扮演的依莱汗是相当成功，感动人的。其他如演岩温、波依汗和叭波龙的演员都有不同程度的创造。但是，整个戏的演员，无论在唱腔上和表演上还需要作进一步的努力，更好地继承花灯的传统和学习其他兄弟剧的长处。目前比较迫切需要解决的是男角的唱腔问题，因为这关系着人物形象的塑造，要完满地解决这个问题需要音乐工作者和演员一道来努力。
    云南花灯剧团1954年才正式建团。它的成员都是年青的学生、农民，进团以前只是花灯的爱好者，专业文艺工作者很少，老艺人更少。从这种情况来看，他们能够取得这样良好的成绩，是十分难能可贵的。同时，也说明了党和毛主席文艺思想对花灯艺术发展的决定性的作用。
