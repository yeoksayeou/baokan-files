Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, February 17th: A high tide of learning culture and technology is currently sweeping across Hungary as the working people actively enroll in adult night schools, correspondence schools, and factory-run spare-time schools.

Adult night primary schools and correspondence primary schools have seen significant development. In the 1958-1959 academic year, there were 580 night primary schools nationwide, with 13,712 students. In 1959-1960, both the number of such schools and the number of students increased more than twofold compared to the previous academic year. The number of correspondence primary schools also increased from 468 in the previous academic year to the current 631, with the number of participating workers more than doubling.

Factory-run spare-time night schools and correspondence schools, which are very popular among workers, have greatly developed over the past year with the assistance of trade unions. Currently, 195 factories nationwide have established such schools, with nearly 10,000 workers enrolled.

The government and various production units strongly support workers' learning. Many places have implemented a social scholarship system to help outstanding young workers pursue advanced studies in universities and colleges. In factories, the work of training technical workers is also universally valued by leaders. The Danube Iron and Steel Plant has opened a training class for workers in every profession. Whenever the Hungarian Optical Works produces a new product, it organizes a special training class to introduce the new product's performance and operating methods. Technicians at the Csepel Iron and Steel Works serve as instructors in the training classes.

Workers regard improving their technical knowledge as an important condition for obtaining the glorious title of "Socialist Labor Team." Currently, the "Young Professional Experts" movement is in full swing in factories and enterprises. With enriched technical theoretical knowledge, workers are constantly making significant achievements in improving labor productivity, reducing production costs, and improving product quality.

With the great development of the agricultural collectivization movement, a high tide of learning has also been set off in rural areas. Over the past year, more than 1,500 agricultural training classes, each lasting four months, were held in various localities. Before the start of spring fieldwork this year, various specialized training classes were held on poultry farming, vegetable cultivation, and other subjects. In addition to teaching professional knowledge, these training classes also use diverse teaching methods such as films and objects to explain to students the formation of the earth, the origin of life, and the superiority of large-scale cooperative management. They also introduce the advanced experiences of socialist countries in agriculture, which has had a good effect.

Twenty collectivized villages in Veszprém County have established professional technical night schools with classes in horticulture, potato cultivation, animal husbandry, and beekeeping. In Szolnok County, 8,000 agricultural production cooperative members are using the winter to study. In order to adapt to the needs of the current development of the agricultural collectivization movement, Baranya County has established 20 adult night schools, correspondence schools, and training classes. The county women's committee has also set up training classes specifically for female members.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, February 17th: In order to bring education further closer to production and life, the Hungarian government will continue to vigorously promote comprehensive technical education in primary schools and implement the "five-plus-one" system (five days of classes, one day of labor in factories or rural areas) in secondary schools this year.

The state will allocate more than 10 million forints for this purpose this year, and various mass organizations and factories and enterprises will also provide active support. The value of the machinery, equipment, and operating tools they provide has reached more than 14 million forints. With the help of factories, seventeen of the forty-three secondary schools in Budapest that implement the "five-plus-one" system have established their own workshops.

This year, 1,500 primary schools will implement comprehensive technical education, with 210,000 students receiving comprehensive technical education. In the 1958-1959 academic year, only 551 primary schools nationwide implemented comprehensive technical education. It is expected that by the end of the second Five-Year Plan (1965), the number of schools implementing comprehensive technical education will reach 4,200. After the start of the current semester, 600 classes in 176 secondary schools have begun to implement the "five-plus-one" system. Last year's experiments proved that this is the best basic teaching system for secondary schools. According to plan, by 1965, this system will be popularized in all secondary schools across the country.

In order to gradually solve the problem of continued education for young people who do not continue their studies after graduating from primary school, 247 industrial and agricultural technical schools have now been established across the country, including 42 industrial technical schools and 205 agricultural technical schools, with more than 13,000 students. It is planned that the number of industrial and agricultural technical schools nationwide will increase to nearly 500 this autumn, and will be popularized nationwide by 1963.

    培养新型人才　加速社会主义建设
    匈牙利工农群众猛攻文化技术堡垒
    小学推行综合技术教育　中学推行五天上课一天劳动制
    新华社布达佩斯17日电　目前匈牙利劳动人民正在全国各地掀起一个学习文化和技术的高潮。职工们纷纷报名进入成人夜校、函授学校和工厂业余学校学习。
    成人夜小学和函授小学都有显著发展。1958—1959年学年中，全国共有五百八十个夜小学，学员有一万三千七百一十二人；在1959—1960年度，这类学校的数目和学员人数都比上一学年增加了两倍以上。函授小学的数目也从上一学年的四百六十八个增加到目前的六百三十一个，参加学习的职工人数也增加了一倍多。
    最受工人欢迎的工厂业余夜校和函授学校一年来在工会的协助下有了很大的发展。目前全国已有一百九十五个工厂举办了这样的学校，入学职工近一万人。
    政府和各生产单位大力支持职工学习。根多地方实行了社会助学金制度，帮助优秀的劳动青年到高等学校深造。在工厂中，培养技术工人的工作也受到领导上的普遍重视。多瑙钢铁厂每一专业都为工人们开设了一个训练班。匈牙利光学用品厂每当生产一种新产品时，就开办一个专门介绍新产品的性能和操作方法的训练班。切佩尔钢铁厂的技术人员都是训练班的教员。
    工人们把提高技术知识做为取得“社会主义劳动队”这一光荣称号的重要条件之一。目前在各工厂企业中，“青年专业能手”运动正在热火朝天地展开着。由于丰富了技术理论知识，工人们不断在提高劳动生产率、降低生产成本和提高产品质量等方面取得显著成绩。
    随着农业合作化运动的巨大发展，在农村中也掀起了学习高潮。去年一年内各地共举办了一千五百多个为期四个月的农业训练班。在今年春季田间工作开始之前，又举办了喂养家禽、培植蔬菜等各种专业训练班。这些训练班除了教授专业知识外，还通过电影、实物等多种多样的教学方法向学员们讲解地球的形成，生命的起源以及合作社大规模经营的优越性，并介绍社会主义各国在农业方面的先进经验，效果很好。
    维斯普雷姆州有二十个合作化村庄开办了专业技术夜校，设有园艺、马铃薯培植、畜牧、养蜂等班级。索尔诺克州有八千个农业生产合作社社员利用冬季时间进行学习。巴兰尼亚州为了适应当前农业生产合作化运动发展的需要，成立了二十个成人夜校、函授学校和训练班。州妇女委员会还专门为女社员开办了训练班。
    新华社布达佩斯17日电　匈牙利政府为了使教育进一步接近生产和生活，今年将在小学中继续大力推行综合技术教育，在中学中推行“五加一”制（五天上课，一天到工厂或农村劳动）。
    国家今年用于这方面的资金达一千多万福林，各群众团体和工厂企业也给予积极的支持。他们所提供的机器设备和操作工具的价值已达一千四百多万福林。在工厂的帮助下，布达佩斯市实行“五加一”制的四十三个中学中，已有十七个设立了自己的工作车间。
    今年将要有一千五百个小学实行综合技术教育，接受综合技术教育的学生达二十一万。而在1958—1959学年，全国只有五百五十一个小学实行综合技术教育。预计到第二个五年计划末（1965年），实行综合技术教育的学校将达四千二百个。本学期开学后，有一百七十六个中学的六百个班开始实行“五加一”制。去年的试验证明，这是中学最好的基本教学制度。按照计划，到1965年，这种制度将普及到全国各个中学。
    为了逐步解决小学毕业后不再继续升学的少年的继续学习问题，现在全国已建立了二百四十七个工农业技术学校，其中四十二个是工业技术学校，二百零五个是农业技术学校，学生达一万三千多人。计划在今年秋天全国工农业技术学校将增加到近五百个，到1963年将普及全国。
