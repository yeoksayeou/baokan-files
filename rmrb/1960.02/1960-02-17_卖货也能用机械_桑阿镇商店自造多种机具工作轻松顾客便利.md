The People's Daily reports that the staff of the Sang'a Town Store in Guan County, Shandong Province, have been innovating and reforming, transforming the entire store.

　　Now, in the cotton cloth department, the colorful cotton cloths are all mounted on the wooden shafts of the suspended cloth display racks. Customers can see, touch, and freely choose and compare each piece of cloth. Once they've made a selection, they only need to look at the quick calculation card hanging on each cloth shaft to know how much money to pay for the number of feet they want, without the salesperson using an abacus. If the cloth on some shafts is sold out, the salesperson only needs to turn on the fast cloth-rolling and yardage-marking machine on the all-purpose counter. In one minute, they can roll a bolt of cloth and mark the yardage. The all-purpose counter also has a coin changer and a customer measuring ruler. Through this series of technological innovations, the labor efficiency of the entire cotton cloth department has been greatly improved. In the past, on market days, customers were packed in layers, and six to ten salespeople were overwhelmed, with average daily sales of less than 700 yuan. Now, with three to five salespeople on each market day, they can sell 1,200 to 1,500 yuan, and up to 8,000 yuan at most.

　　In the grocery department, which sells oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and other sundries, the salespeople's oily and busy appearance is also gone. Salespeople only need to pull the rope of the liquid commodity dispenser to allow the liquid commodity to flow into the consumers' bottles and cans in the right amount. In the past, three people in this department were extremely busy. Now, one person can do the work easily and happily.

　　In the food and beverage department, employees have successively created and imitated advanced tools and equipment such as nine-eye stoves, vegetable cutting machines, food delivery machines, and dumpling-making machines, realizing "no knives needed for cutting vegetables, no one needed for cooking food, no walking needed for delivering food, and no hands needed for wrapping dumplings." The nine-eye stove, like stars surrounding the moon, only needs to have each furnace chamber filled with coal in the morning, and the fire in the main chamber lit, to last all day without adding coal. When necessary, all nine furnace chambers can produce fire at the same time, cooking nine dishes simultaneously.

　　Another huge effect of technological innovation is that it has transformed many previously considered useless wastes into useful materials. The store's comprehensive processing plant can produce dozens of kinds of food without using a single grain of food crops. Over the past year, they have successively experimented with and promoted the use of nearly a hundred kinds of alternative raw materials, such as multi-headed sorghum stalks, wheat stalks, locust beans, tree leaves, bean stalks, sesame stalks, peanut skins, sweet potato skins (vines), cottonseed skins, and weeds, to produce large quantities of white wine, brown sugar, pastries, starch, soy sauce, and handmade paper.

### 卖货也能用机械  桑阿镇商店自造多种机具工作轻松顾客便利

    卖货也能用机械
    桑阿镇商店自造多种机具工作轻松顾客便利
    本报讯　山东省冠县桑阿镇商店职工，人人创造，人人革新，使整个商店面貌一新。
    现在，在棉布门市部里，五光十色的棉布，都镶在空悬售布架的木轴上，每一块布，顾客都能看得见，摸得着，任意挑选比较，选中了，只要看一下每个布轴上吊的速算牌，就可以知道买几尺布该付多少钱，不用售货员动算盘。如果有的布轴上的布卖完了，售货员只要拧一下设在全能柜台上的快速卷布压码机，一分钟就可以把一匹布卷好，并且压好尺码。在全能柜台上，还设有硬币找零器，顾客量布尺等。通过这样一系列的技术革新，使整个棉布门市部的劳动效率大大提高。过去，每逢集日，顾客里三层外三层，六到十名售货员应接不暇，每天平均销货额不到七百元。现在每集三至五名售货员，可以卖到一千二百到一千五百元，最多到八千元。
    在油、盐、酱、醋等杂货门市部里，售货员那种满身油污，忙忙碌碌的情况也不见了。售货员只要一拉动液体商品出售器的绳索，就可以使液体商品如数地流进消费者的瓶瓶罐罐里。过去这个门市部里三个人忙得不可开交，现在一个人干得轻松愉快。
    在饮食业门市部里，职工们先后创造和仿制了九眼灶、切菜机、送菜机、包饺机等先进工具和设备，实现了“切菜不用刀，熟食无人烧，送菜不用走，包包不用手”。像众星捧月一样的九眼灶，只要早晨把各个炉腔填满煤，点燃主腔的火，就可以一天不添煤。必要时，可以九个炉腔同时出火，同时烹调九个菜。
    技术革新的另一巨大的效果，是把许多过去认为无用的废品，变成了有用的物资。这个商店的综合加工厂，可以一粒粮食不用，生产数十种食品。一年来，他们先后试验成功并推广利用的有多穗高粱秸、麦秸、槐树豆、树叶、豆秸、芝麻秸、花生皮、地瓜皮（把）、棉籽皮、杂草等近百种代用原料，生产了大批白酒、红糖、糕点、淀粉、酱油和土纸。
