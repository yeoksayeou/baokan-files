Harbin Meat संयुक्त Processing Plant, in the spirit of a socialist enterprise that "must both produce new products and cultivate new people," has persisted in workers' spare-time education for twelve years, improving the cultural and technical level of workers and changing the face of enterprise production.

Now, this factory has developed from several literacy classes in 1948 into a worker spare-time education system with sixty-four classes, ranging from elementary school to university. The original 80% of workers who were illiterate or semi-illiterate have now all overcome illiteracy; 35.1% of the original 700-plus workers have reached the level of higher primary school, 31.7% have reached the level of junior high school, 29.9% have reached the level of secondary specialized or high school, and 3.3% have entered spare-time universities. Among the middle-level leading cadres, the original ten illiterate and semi-illiterate cadres have now reached the level of high school or above. In recent years, this factory has also trained and transferred 389 enterprise management cadres and 127 technical cadres for the state.

The predecessor of the Harbin Meat संयुक्त Processing Plant was an old slaughterhouse established in 1913, and the cultural level of the workers was very low. After liberation, this factory developed into a comprehensive meat joint processing enterprise, undertaking the arduous task of processing various meat products for export and domestic sales; however, heavy manual labor, mainly manual operation, accounted for a large proportion of the entire production process. In order to rapidly change the backward state of enterprise production, this factory, in the spirit of self-reliance, focusing on production, grasped production with one hand and education with the other, systematically improving the cultural level of workers; at the same time, according to the needs of production development, focused on training junior professional and technical personnel in meat food processing, refrigeration, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, and enterprise management cadres. Now, 40% of the factory's workers have mastered more than three kinds of skills and have become "all-rounders" in production. Many workers also used the cultural and technical knowledge they have learned, combined with production, to carry out technological innovation, so that more than 50% of the factory's production process has achieved semi-mechanization and mechanization of manual operations.

In adhering to twelve years of workers' spare-time education, the Harbin Meat संयुक्त Processing Plant has conscientiously implemented the policy of the whole Party and the whole factory running schools. The factory Party committee has always listed workers' spare-time education as one of the Party's important daily tasks. In addition to designating a secretary to be responsible for workers' education, the Party committee implemented a "battle line division of labor," stipulating that from the Party secretary to all levels of Party organizations, they must be responsible for production, ideology, and education. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, the factory and workshops have established workers' education committees and education groups with the participation of administration, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League. While inspecting production, all departments and organizations at all levels regularly check the progress of workers' education. The factory leadership cadres inspect classroom teaching, the workshop leadership and teachers and student representatives inspect each other, and the group inspects weekly. Problems are discovered and solved in a timely manner to ensure the consolidation and development of workers' spare-time education.

This factory also uses the successful experience of vigorously launching mass movements, combined with the characteristics of workers' spare-time education, to carry out mass-scale competitions among the factory's branch schools, classes, students and teachers: comparing attendance rate, teaching quality, the combination of learning and application, teacher-student relations, class management, etc., and selecting outstanding units, outstanding students, and outstanding teachers to encourage the teaching and learning enthusiasm of the vast number of workers. Therefore, during the factory's great battle in August and September last year, while deeply carrying out the movement to increase production and practice thrift, workers' spare-time education also showed a new situation of vigorous development, and the attendance rate of various branch schools in the factory remained above 90%.

Another important experience of the Harbin Meat संयुक्त Processing Plant in persisting in running schools for twelve years is that it is good at making overall plans and unified arrangements according to the factory's production characteristics. The factory Party committee considered that the factory undertakes the arduous task of processing various meat products for export and domestic sales and must train a large number of technical personnel and enterprise management cadres to meet the needs of production development. Therefore, starting with literacy classes in 1948 to eliminate illiteracy and semi-illiteracy among workers, they immediately started spare-time higher primary schools in one go, and gradually developed and established middle school classes, secondary specialized classes, and university classes according to the plan for training cadres. At the same time, in teaching, political, technical, and cultural courses are all included in the education plan, and teaching is carried out in different proportions according to the specific circumstances of each level and type of class, so that workers can not only systematically improve their culture and technology, but also use the knowledge they have learned to promote production development. In terms of teaching time arrangement, this factory, according to the characteristics of "decentralized production, complex types of work, diverse shifts, busy in winter and slack in summer, and normal in spring and autumn," puts forward the requirements of "learning more in the off-season, learning less in the peak season, and not stopping learning during concentrated production," and makes specific arrangements according to the different conditions of each workshop: ensuring that units with relatively normal production learn for eight hours a week; units with relatively busy production tasks learn for six hours a week; and units with multiple shifts in production and heavy and busy production tasks adopt methods such as following-shift teaching and make-up classes, using all available time to make up the whole from parts, ensuring six hours of study per week.

    哈尔滨肉类联合加工厂重视提高职工文化技术水平
    坚持职工业余教育十二年
    现已形成从小学到大学的比较完整的教育体系
    本报讯　哈尔滨肉类联合加工厂，本着社会主义企业“既要生产新产品，又要培养新人”的精神，十二年如一日地坚持职工业余教育，提高了职工文化技术水平，改变了企业生产面貌。
    现在，这个工厂已经由1948年的几个识字班，发展形成了从小学到大学，拥有六十四个班级的职工业余教育体系。原来占职工总数80％的文盲、半文盲，现已全部摆脱文盲状态；原有的七百余名职工，有35．1％已达到高小水平，有31．7％达到初中水平，有29．9％达到中等专业或高中水平，有3．3％已进入了业余大学。中层领导干部中原有十名文盲和半文盲，现在已达到高中或高中以上程度。几年来，这个工厂还为国家培养和输送了企业管理干部三百八十九人，技术干部一百二十七人。
    哈尔滨肉类联合加工厂的前身，是1913年建立的一个老旧的屠宰场，职工文化程度很低。解放后，这个工厂发展成为综合性肉类联合加工企业，承担着加工出口和内销各种肉类产品的繁重任务；但整个生产过程中以手工操作为主的笨重体力劳动，却占很大比重。为了迅速改变企业生产的落后面貌，这个工厂本着自力更生的精神，以生产为中心，一手抓生产，一手抓教育，有系统地提高职工的文化水平；同时，根据生产发展需要，重点地培养肉食品加工、制冷、畜牧兽医等初级专业技术人材和企业管理干部。现在，全厂已经有40％的职工掌握了三种以上技术，成了生产上的“多面手”。很多职工并运用所学的文化技术知识，结合生产大闹革新，使全厂生产过程有50％以上实现了手工操作半机械化、机械化。
    哈尔滨肉类联合加工厂在坚持十二年的职工业余教育中，认真贯彻全党全厂办学方针。工厂党委一直把职工业余教育工作，列为党的日常重要工作之一，除指定一名书记负责职工教育外，党委实行了“战线分工”，规定从党委书记到各级党组织都需包管生产、包管思想、包管教育。工厂及车间在党委统一领导下，都成立了有行政、工会、共青团参加的职工教育委员会和教育小组。各部门及各级组织在检查生产的同时，都定期检查职工教育工作情况。并实行了厂领导干部检查课堂教学，车间领导和教员、学员代表互相检查，小组按周检查等办法，发现问题，及时解决，保证职工业余教育的巩固发展。
    这个工厂还运用大搞群众运动的成功经验，结合职工业余教育工作特点，在工厂各分校、班级、学员教师中开展群众性的大评比：比出席率，比教学质量、比学用结合、比师生关系、比班级管理等，评选优秀单位、优秀学员和优秀教师，鼓舞广大职工的教、学热情。因而在去年工厂大战8、9月，深入开展增产节约运动的同时，职工业余教育也出现蓬勃发展的新局面，工厂各个分校的出席率都保持在90％以上。
    哈尔滨肉类联合加工厂坚持十二年办学的另一重要经验，是善于根据工厂生产特点，全面规划，统一安排。工厂党委考虑到工厂承担着加工出口和内销各种肉类产品的繁重任务，必须培养大量技术人材和企业管理干部以适应生产发展需要。因此从1948年开办识字班着手扫除职工中的文盲、半文盲，随即一鼓作气开办业余高小，并根据培养干部的规划，逐步发展建立了中学班、中等专业班、大学班。同时，在教学中把政治、技术和文化课程全部纳入教育规划，根据各级各类班级具体情况，按不同比例进行教学，使职工不仅系统提高文化、技术，也能运用学得的知识推动生产发展。在教学时间安排上，这个工厂根据“生产分散，工种复杂、班次多样、冬忙夏闲、春秋正常”的特点，提出“淡季多学、旺季少学、突击生产不停学”的要求，并根据各车间不同情况作出具体安排：保证生产较正常车间，每周学八小时；生产任务比较繁忙单位每周学六小时；在生产多班捣、生产任务又繁又忙的单位，则采取跟班教学、补课等形式，利用一切可利用时间，以零凑整，保证每周学习六小时。
