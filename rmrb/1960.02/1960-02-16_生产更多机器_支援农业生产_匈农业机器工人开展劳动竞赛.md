Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, February 11th: To produce more machines to vigorously support agricultural production, the broad masses of workers and staff in Hungary's agricultural machinery industry sector have universally launched a labor emulation drive. They have decided to do their utmost in the first quarter to provide more tractors and rush to manufacture over a thousand large-scale seeders, in order to better assist in the spring plowing and sowing work.

    The workers and staff of the Red Star Tractor Factory have recently shortened the time to produce each tractor by thirty to fifty hours. This will increase the annual production by two thousand five hundred modern agricultural machines. This factory will also begin manufacturing many new types of tractors this year, among which the newly designed dL-60 type crawler tractor has twice the traction of the old-fashioned crawler tractors. To support spring agricultural production, they have decided to produce machine parts worth 20 million forints at the beginning of the year to ensure that agricultural machinery stations can repair machines in a timely manner.

    The production of the Mosonmagyaróvár Agricultural Machine Factory this year will be doubled compared to last year. All the workers and staff of the factory are determined to rush to manufacture five hundred large-scale seeders to support this year's spring plowing and sowing work. The upsurge of inventions and technological innovations in this factory is also unusually high. The workers and staff are improving the components of the seeders so that they can be used for fertilization at the same time. In addition, they are also trial-producing ten new types of seeders.

    The workers and staff of the forage harvester factory, which only started production last year, are also full of energy. They have decided to increase production by one-third this year. They are currently manufacturing many new types of harvesters. The corn harvester produced by this factory is much better in function than similar machines produced by other countries. They are also trying their best to reduce production costs, and this year they will reduce the weight of the AS-type forage combine harvester by 20% to reduce the consumption of raw materials.

    生产更多机器　支援农业生产
    匈农业机器工人开展劳动竞赛
    新华社布达佩斯11日电　为了生产更多的机器来大力支援农业生产，匈牙利农业机器工业部门的广大职工普遍展开了劳动竞赛。他们决定在第一季度中尽力提供更多的拖拉机，并赶制一千多台大型播种机，以便更好地协助春耕春播工作的进行。
    红星拖拉机工厂的职工们最近把生产每台拖拉机的时间缩短三十到五十小时。这样全年将增产二千五百台现代化的农业机器。这个工厂今年还将开始制造很多新型拖拉机，其中新设计的dL—60型履带拖拉机的引力相当于旧式履带拖拉机的两倍。为支援春季农业生产，他们决定在年初就生产价值二千万福林的机器零件，以保证农业机器站能及时检修机器。
    莫松马乔罗瓦农业机器厂今年的生产将比去年提高一倍。全厂职工决心赶制五百台大型播种机来支援今年的春耕春播工作。这个工厂的发明创造和革新技术的热潮也异常高涨。职工们正在改进播种机的机件，使其能同时用来施肥。此外，他们还正在试制十种新型播种机。
    去年才投入生产的饲料收割机工厂的职工们也是干劲十足。他们决定今年把生产提高三分之一。目前他们正在制造很多种新型收割机。这个厂所生产的玉米收割机，比其他国家生产的同类机器的功能要好得多。他们并尽力设法降低生产成本，今年将把AS型的饲料联合收割机的重量减轻20％，以减少原料的消耗。
