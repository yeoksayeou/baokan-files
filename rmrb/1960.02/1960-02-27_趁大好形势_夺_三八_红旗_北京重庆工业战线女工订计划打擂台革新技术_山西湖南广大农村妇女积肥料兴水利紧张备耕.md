Xinhua News Agency, February 26th. Taking advantage of the excellent situation, female workers on the industrial front in Beijing and Chongqing are setting plans, competing, and innovating technology. In Shanxi and Hunan, large numbers of rural women are accumulating fertilizer, building water conservancy projects, and preparing for spring plowing.

More than 310,000 female workers on the industrial front in the capital are taking practical actions to participate actively in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to welcome the 50th anniversary of International Working Women's Day on March 8th.

Many factories have set up merit-making and skills competition platforms and launched various competition activities such as the "Clever Girls Competition." At the Beijing Electron Tube Factory, where female workers account for 56% of the total workforce, they are actively involved in the technical revolution movement centered on automation, linkage, and remote control. Together with male workers, they achieved more than 2,700 technical innovations from February 1st to 16th alone, including more than 900 major and key items. They also realized 42 linked machines and linked production lines, and 74 single-machine automation projects, greatly improving labor efficiency and saving a large number of labor force. The mica sheet automatic roller sprayer successfully trial-produced by the female workers of the Chemical Branch of this factory increased work efficiency five times. Lu Aihua, a young female worker from the Ninth Branch, with the help of her master, succeeded in trial-producing a set of side-heated electron tube linkage line after repeated experiments, which not only saved labor but also saved two pieces of equipment. All the female workers in the factory proposed to realize 50 automated production lines before the "March 8th" festival with the help of experienced masters. The female workers of the Beijing Wire Factory are launching a "Five Red Competition" activity: being red in politics, red in technical revolution and production, red in social activities and learning, red in unity, mutual assistance and cooperation, and red in arranging housework and attendance. They plan to realize more than 1,200 technical innovation suggestions by the end of February, and 600 have already been realized. The silk-covered wire dipping paint automation realized by the female workers in Workshop 22 of this factory increased efficiency six times. The sandblasting machine improved by four female workers in the sandblasting group of Workshop 1 of Xingping Machinery Factory greatly reduced labor intensity. In order to commemorate International Working Women's Day, they named this sandblasting machine "March 8th" Liberation Sandblasting Machine.

The female workers of the Beijing Qinghe Woolen Mill plan to make twelve new products to welcome their festival. Now they have successfully trial-produced new products such as nylon plush, printed plush, printed Valdini, nylon blended gabardine, ladies' tweed, and No. 10 fine tweed together with the male workers. The female workers of the Beijing Joint State-Private Clock Factory established the "March 8th Mu Guiying" division, carried out a red, diligent, and clever pacesetter competition centered on technical innovation, and successfully completed the production tasks. In the "Nine Sisters Group" of this factory, four female workers worked on drilling holes in clock shaft ancient wheels. After the competition, the daily output increased from 900 to 1,750; all the female workers in the "March 8th Clever Work Team," with the help of experienced masters, successfully created the "March 8th" automatic lathe, increasing work efficiency five times. The female workers of this factory also successfully trial-produced an automatic riveting machine, increasing work efficiency forty times.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, February 26th. Female workers on the industrial front in Chongqing are actively participating in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, taking practical actions to welcome the 50th anniversary of International Working Women's Day on March 8th.

The female workers of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, in order to welcome their festival, have successively set collective or individual plans and participated in the factory-wide competition. The clever girl groups in many workshops are full of energy in the competition and constantly create new records. The clever girls in the refractory material workshop improved the simple brick-making machine. Originally, one person could make more than 300 bricks a day, but now they can make more than 1,000 bricks. In the first half of February, the female workers of ten factories in the mechanical system realized more than 230 single-machine automation projects and 25 automatic production lines, of which six factories converted more than 580 manual operations into mechanical operations. The clever girl group in the 41st workshop of the Construction Machine Tool Factory realized 14 automatic production lines after 16 days of effort. Due to the large-scale mechanization and automation, the clever girl group in the youth section of the 34th workshop of this factory completed one month's workload in four days, and they are already doing the work for June. The female workers in the silkworm cocoon selection workshop of the Chongqing Silk Spinning Factory have always been operating manually. Recently, after more than ten days of effort, they have all realized mechanized cocoon selection, and labor productivity has increased thirty times.

Many factories and mines have also widely carried out activities to evaluate clever girls and female pacesetters among female workers. Chongqing Iron and Steel Company selected more than 100 outstanding female workers in January and February alone. At present, more than 300 female activists in building socialism and more than 2,000 advanced production groups or production teams of clever girls or red girls have emerged in the city.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, February 26th. In order to welcome their festival, rural women in Shanxi Province have actively invested in preparatory activities for spring plowing, mainly accumulating fertilizer, delivering fertilizer, and building water conservancy projects.

By February 18th, female members of people's communes throughout the province had accumulated more than 2.09 billion dan of fertilizer and delivered more than 245 million dan of fertilizer. In addition, 55 10,000-head pig farms and 10,000-chicken farms were built, more than 1,300 wells were dug, and more than 1,000 canals were repaired. The number of women participating in fertilizer accumulation throughout the province accounted for more than 85% of the rural female labor force, which is more than in any previous year. In many areas, women also held activities for fertilizer accumulation and high-yield weeks and fertilizer accumulation and high-yield days. In Jinzhong Prefecture, more than 200,000 women in seven counties, including Shouyang, Jiexiu, Pingyao, Taigu, Wenshui, and Jiaocheng, accumulated more than 78.8 million dan of fertilizer in ten days. Yicheng County organized seven high-yield days and one shock week, accumulating more than 71.1 million dan of fertilizer, and all of it was delivered to the fields.

More than 3,600 women at the water conservancy construction site in Yangqu County widely launched a skills competition, which continuously improved labor efficiency. Gao Lanying's platoon competed with Peng Fengxian's platoon. As a result of the competition, both sides achieved a record of digging three cubic meters of soil per person per day and won the red flag of the entire construction site. The 600 women in Guodao Commune, Qin County, originally planned to complete the 16-meter-high "March 8th Thousand Women Reservoir" by the end of April. After brainstorming and improving work methods, it was completed in only 14 days.

Recently, eight million rural women in Hunan Province have revised their production plans, determined to welcome the 50th anniversary of International Working Women's Day on March 8th with practical actions to do a good job in spring plowing. The Women's Federation of Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture is establishing 20 women's economic crop bases and organizing 200,000 women to plant 200,000 mu of high-yield rice fields to commemorate International Working Women's Day on March 8th. The Women's Federation of Gaoping Commune in Longhui County mobilized 6,000 women to plant one mu of high-yield field with high income per person. The women of Dongling Commune in Rugui County increased the original plan of planting 452 mu of women's high-yield fields to 1,200 mu. At present, they have plowed all the high-yield fields twice, harrowed them twice, and applied 600 dan of pig manure to each mu of field.

In the spring plowing production, women in various places have widely carried out activities to increase fertilizer sources and build large fertilizer bases centered on pig raising. Nearly one million women in Changde Prefecture who have invested in preparatory production have accumulated 1.83 billion and 4 million dan of various fertilizers. After four days of hard work, 120 women in Qingxi Brigade of Zhuquan Commune, Anren County, built a pig farm with self-flowing water and fertilizer transportation, laying a good foundation for raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer. Chen Pingxiu and other twelve women from Shiniu Production Team of Tuotang Commune, Shuangfeng County, also formed a fertilizer accumulation expedition team and went to the mountains three miles away from the village to accumulate fertilizer. They accumulated 6,500 dan of mountain vine fertilizer in two days, averaging more than 270 dan of fertilizer per person per day.

In the spring plowing production, women in many areas have also launched a mass movement in which everyone contributes ideas and everyone engages in innovation. With the strong support of the Party branch, the girls of the "Liu Hulan Assault Team" of Longhu Brigade, Liaoshi Commune, Chen County, rushed to repair the field road day and night, so that the fertilizer transportation work was fully realized by vehicle. They also assisted carpenters in making 58 rice transplanters. Yang Shenggui, deputy director of Ganxi Breeding Farm in Xinhuang Dong Autonomous County, after intensive study and hard work, successfully trial-produced a feeding mixer, which increased work efficiency more than 20 times. She also led the breeders of the entire farm to build 50 warm in winter and cool in summer, clean and hygienic pig houses after five days of effort.

In order to promote the transformation of agricultural technology and promote the rapid progress of spring plowing production, the Women's Federations of Hengyang, Chen County, Xiangtan and other prefectures also organized a large number of women to participate in the on-site performance competition of rice transplanters. Many counties mobilized a large number of women to study advanced rice transplanting techniques in the rice transplanting expert training class.
