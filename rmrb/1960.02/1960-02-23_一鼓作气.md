    At One Go
    There is an ancient Chinese fable called "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains." This story is widely circulated among the people. It tells that no matter what you do, you must have a spirit, confidence, and perseverance. In 1945, Comrade Mao Zedong used the spirit of "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains" to inspire the revolutionary fighting spirit of the whole Party and the entire people. In the past, we held high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieved great victories in all aspects. Today, on the battlefronts of cultural and technological revolution, we should implement this spirit even more.
    To climb the peaks of culture, science, and technology requires effort in two aspects: one is accumulating time, and the other is overcoming difficulties. This requires the spirit of "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains."
    From the perspective of learning time, one minute or one hour may not seem like much in isolation, and you may not learn much. But accumulated, it becomes considerable. But to achieve this, you must first have perseverance and spirit. The Harbin Meat Processing Plant has this spirit and perseverance. The workers' spare-time education has persisted for twelve years. Many departments in this factory have busy production schedules, so they use the spirit of "piecing together small bits" to squeeze out time for learning, ensuring the completion of learning tasks. As a result of this "piecing together," all the illiterate workers shed their illiteracy, and they continued to learn with one go, so that more than 700 employees reached the level of higher primary school, junior high school, and high school respectively, and some even entered spare-time universities to study.
    From the perspective of overcoming difficulties, it requires methods and measures to overcome difficulties. From leaders to individuals, we must carry forward the spirit of seeking truth from facts, formulate practical and feasible plans and measures based on specific circumstances to ensure the smooth progress of learning. In this regard, the Harbin Meat Processing Plant has valuable experience in both leadership methods and teaching principles. Since "The Foolish Old Man" can "remove mountains," if we move forward with one go, we can also climb the peaks of culture, science, and technology.

    一鼓作气
    我国古代有个寓言，叫“愚公移山”。这个故事，在民间广为流传。它说的是无论办什么事情，都要有一股子劲头，有信心，有毅力。1945年，毛泽东同志就曾以“愚公移山”的精神，来激励全党全民的革命斗志。过去，我们高举着毛泽东思想的红旗，在各方面都取得了伟大的胜利；今天，在文化和技术革命战线上，更应当贯彻这一精神。
    攀登文化科学技术的高峰，要有两方面的努力。一是积以时日，一是克服困难。这就要有“愚公移山”的精神。
    从学习时间说，一分钟，一点钟，孤立看起来，并不算多，可能学不到很多东西；但是积累起来，就很可观。但是要做到这一点，首先要有毅力，有劲头。哈尔滨肉类联合加工厂有这种劲头，有这种毅力，职工业余教育坚持了十二年。这个工厂有许多部门生产比较繁忙，就用“以零凑整”的精神，挤时间学习，保证了学习任务的完成。这个工厂“凑”的结果，使所有的文盲都丢掉了文盲帽子，同时一鼓作气地学下去，使七百余名职工又分别达到高小、初中和高中水平，有些人还进入了业余大学学习。
    从克服困难说，要求有克服困难的办法和措施。从领导到个人，都必须发扬实事求是的精神，根据具体情况，订出切实可行的规划和措施，来保证学习顺利进行。在这方面，哈尔滨肉类联合加工厂无论在领导方法上，教学原则上，都有着值得学习的经验。“愚公”既能“移山”，我们一鼓作气地前进，文化科学技术的高峰也就能够攀登。
