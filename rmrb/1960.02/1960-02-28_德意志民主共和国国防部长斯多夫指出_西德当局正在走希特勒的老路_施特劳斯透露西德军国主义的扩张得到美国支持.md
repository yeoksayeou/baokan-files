Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 26th. GDR Defense Minister General Stoph told reporters from the German News Agency tonight that West Germany's plan to establish military bases in Spain is outrageous. He said it is clear that West German militarists want to incorporate Spain into Bonn's militaristic plans.

	General Stoph said that Strauss, Heusinger, and other German militarists, like Hitler, want to prepare new massacre plots in fascist Spain in a war using nuclear weapons and missile weapons against socialist countries.

	General Stoph pointed out that the fact that West German militarists are establishing military ties with a country that does not belong to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization once again powerfully illustrates the danger that German militarists pose to European peace and that these aggressive forces do not want to abandon their aggressive policies.

	General Stoph said that the most important conclusion to be drawn from this new war plan is that the following proposals of the German Democratic Republic must be realized: stop armaments, sign a non-aggression treaty between the two German states, conclude a peace treaty and peacefully resolve the West Berlin issue, and expose the conspiracies of the warmongers.

Xinhua News Agency, February 27th. Reports from Western news agencies and newspapers show that the West German Adenauer government has long been plotting to establish military bases in Spain and other Western European countries and has received support from the United States.

	According to a United Press International dispatch from Bonn on February 26th, the West German government has been discussing the establishment of bases in Spain with the Franco regime for nearly two years.

	According to the West German "Die Welt," Strauss said at a closed-door meeting of the West German Federal Parliament's Defense Committee on February 25th that the US military leaders and the Supreme Commander of the European Forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, US General Norstad, did not oppose the West German government's "desire" to establish military bases in Spain. The West German German News Agency also said on February 26th that US Secretary of State Herter agreed to West Germany's move to seek the establishment of military bases abroad at the Western Four Foreign Ministers' meeting in Paris last December.

    德意志民主共和国国防部长斯多夫指出
    西德当局正在走希特勒的老路
    施特劳斯透露西德军国主义的扩张得到美国支持
    新华社柏林26日电　德意志民主共和国国防部长斯多夫大将今晚对德意志通讯社记者发表谈话说，西德计划在西班牙建立军事基地这件事是令人愤怒的。他说，显然西德军国主义者是要把西班牙纳入波恩的军国主义计划之中。
    斯多夫大将说，施特劳斯、豪辛格和其他德国军国主义分子同希特勒一样，想在一次用核武器和导弹武器来反对社会主义国家的战争中，在法西斯西班牙准备新的屠杀勾当。
    斯多夫大将指出，西德军国主义者同一个不属于北大西洋公约组织的国家发生军事联系这一事实，再一次有力地说明，德国军国主义者对欧洲和平所造成的危险和这些侵略势力不想放弃他们的侵略政策。
    斯多夫大将说，从这种新的战争计划得出的最重要的结论是，必须实现德意志民主共和国的以下建议：停止军备、在两个德国之间签订互不侵犯条约、缔结和约和和平解决西柏林问题，并揭露战争贩子的阴谋。
    据新华社27日讯　西方通讯社和报纸的报道表明，西德阿登纳政府早就图谋在西班牙和其他西欧国家设立军事基地，并且得到美国的支持。
    据合众国际社26日从波恩发出的消息透露，西德政府同佛朗哥政权讨论在西班牙建立基地已将近有两年了。
    据西德“世界报”报道，施特劳斯25日在西德联邦议院国防委员会的秘密会议上说，美国军事首脑和北大西洋集团欧洲军队最高司令、美国将军诺斯塔德并不反对西德政府在西班牙建立军事基地的“愿望”。西德的德意志新闻社26日还说，美国国务卿赫脱去年12月在巴黎西方四国外长会议上同意了西德谋求在国外建立军事基地的行动。
