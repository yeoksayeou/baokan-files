Developing Technical Education and Cultivating Construction Talent
Continuously Improving the Quality of Technical Education
North Korea Launches Model Technical School Campaign
Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 24th. To promote the development of technical education, the North Korean education department recently launched a campaign to turn 250 technical schools into model technical schools. Technical schools in various regions are enthusiastically participating in this campaign, determined to achieve this goal in the first quarter of this year.

North Korean technical schools are a new type of school that has developed rapidly in the past two years. These schools, based on the Korean Workers' Party's policy of combining education with productive labor, provide students with general and technical knowledge, cultivating personnel who master technology. The Korean Workers' Party and the government have decided to expand these two-year technical schools that enroll junior high school graduates, and to establish two-year higher technical schools that enroll graduates of these technical schools. In the near future, the existing senior high schools will be abolished, and a system of compulsory technical education will be implemented starting in the 1962-1963 academic year.

Recently, technical schools in South Pyongan Province summarized their experiences in closely linking general education subjects with technical subjects, utilizing experimental equipment, visiting production innovators, and strengthening connections with internship factories, further improving the quality of teaching.

Factories, enterprises, institutions, and organizations in various regions actively provide assistance and support to technical schools in terms of materials and other aspects. The Sariwon General Machinery Factory recently manufactured four practice machine tools and various practice machines for the Sariwon Mechanical Industry Technical School. Employees of the North Hwanghae Province Postal and Telecommunications Administration used discarded materials to assemble a radio transmitter for a technical school. The Sariwon First Construction Company also built school buildings for a construction technical school.
Poland Opens Many Agricultural Schools
Over 90,000 Rural Youths Participate in Agricultural Training Classes
Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw. Poland attaches great importance to the development of agricultural education to train personnel for the agricultural front.

In this academic year, the number of agricultural schools across Poland has increased from several dozen three years ago to 1,500, with 45,000 students studying in these schools. During the two-year study period, students will learn various agricultural techniques, animal husbandry, and agricultural knowledge.

To cultivate more primary agricultural personnel, the Polish Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Agriculture have newly opened 650 primary agricultural schools in the new academic year.

In addition to agricultural schools, there are also 8,500 agricultural training classes across Poland, mainly based on self-study, with over 90,000 rural youths participating in the training classes. In addition to planting crops, these youths will also work on experimental corn fields, learn to drive tractors, and learn about agricultural mechanization.

To meet the needs of agricultural production development, the Polish Party and government have also decided to allocate approximately 900 million zlotys (Polish currency) between 1959 and 1965 to accelerate the development of agricultural education.
Czechoslovakia Emphasizes Cultivating Youths with Practical Production Knowledge
Students in the Slovak Region Receive Universal Technical Education
This newspaper reports that currently in the Slovak region of Czechoslovakia, 250,000 students in ordinary schools are receiving comprehensive technical education, greatly expanding their knowledge. Another 27,000 senior grade (10th-12th grade) students have directly participated in work in modernly equipped factories established in Slovakia after liberation.

The number of schools in Slovakia is also increasing year by year. In 1959, 900 newly built, well-lit classrooms were put into use. This year, 1,425 classrooms will be added. It is expected that around 10,000 new classrooms will be built in Slovakia during the third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965). This is equal to the total number of classrooms built in Slovakia in the past 86 years. Today, the growth rate of schools in any region at the foot of the Tatra Mountains greatly exceeds countries such as France, Canada, and Japan, at an unprecedented speed.

A nine-year middle school in the Red Cross district of Bratislava is one of the newly built schools. Like other ordinary schools in Czechoslovakia, this school implements comprehensive technical education. The foundation of comprehensive technical education is labor in the school's affiliated workshops and fields. Particular attention is paid to combining teaching with visits to large mechanical factories, machine and assembly workshops for senior grade students. At the same time, suitable films and slides are used to supplement the impressions of the factories and the knowledge gained in the workshops.
Vigorously Cultivate Skilled Workers and Technicians
Romanian Vocational and Technical Schools Develop Rapidly
This newspaper reports that vocational and technical education in Romania has developed rapidly in recent years. Vocational and technical education is intended to train skilled workers and technicians for economic, social, and cultural sectors. In the 1958-1959 academic year, Romania had over 740 vocational, trade, agricultural, technical, and foreman technical schools, with over 127,000 students (in 1938, there were only 224 vocational schools with over 39,000 students; 142 industrial schools for boys and girls with over 14,000 students).

In ten years, vocational and technical schools have cultivated over 280,000 skilled workers and 128,000 technicians for various production sectors.

The study period for vocational apprentice schools, agricultural and trade schools is two to four years. They only enroll graduates of seven-year schools aged 14 to 17 based on entrance examinations. The students trained by these schools obtain certificates proving different specialized professions. Technical schools for highly skilled workers and technicians only enroll graduates aged 17 to 25 with diplomas. Students of technical and vocational schools participate in theoretical studies while also undertaking internships in school workshops and enterprises near the school. (Attached picture)

    发展技术教育　培养建设人才
    不断提高技术教育的质量
    朝鲜展开模范技术学校运动
    新华社平壤24日电　朝鲜教育部门为了推动技术教育的发展，最近展开了一个运动，争取使二百五十个技术学校成为模范技术学校。各地的技术学校热烈参加这个运动，决心要在今年第一季度实现这一目标。
    朝鲜的技术学校是在近二年内大量发展起来的一种新型的学校。这些学校根据朝鲜劳动党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，对学生进行一般知识和技术知识的教育，培养掌握技术的人材。朝鲜劳动党和政府已经决定扩大这种招收初中毕业生的二年制的技术学校，并且设立招收这种技术学校毕业生的二年制的高等技术学校，在不久以后，废除现有的高级中学，从1962—1963年度开始，实行技术义务教育制度。
    平安南道各技术学校最近总结了使一般教育科目同技术科目紧密联系、活用实验设备、访问生产革新者、加强同实习工厂的联系等经验，使得学校的教学质量有进一步的提高。
    各地的工厂企业、机关团体积极从物质上各方面帮助支援技术学校。沙里院市综合机械工厂最近为沙里院的机械工业技术学校制造了四台实习用的机床和各种实习机械。黄海北道的递信管理处的职工利用废弃材料为技术学校装了一部无线电发报机。沙里院第一建设公司还为建设技术学校建造了校舍。
    波兰各地大量开设农业学校
    九万多农村青年参加农业训练班学习
    新华社华沙电　波兰重视发展农业教育，为农业战线培养人材。
    在本学年里，波兰全国的农业学校已经由三年前的几十所增加到一千五百所，在农业学校学习的达四万五千人。在为期两年的学习期间，学生们将学习各种农业技术、畜牧业和农业等方面的知识。
    为了多培养初级农业人材，波兰教育部和农业部在新学年里新开设了六百五十所初级农业学校。
    除了农业学校以外，波兰各地还成立有八千五百个以自学为主的农业训练班，在训练班学习的有九万多个农村青年。这些青年们除了种植农作物外，还要搞种植玉米的试验田，学习开拖拉机和农业机械化的知识等。
    为了适应农业生产发展的需要，波兰党和政府还决定，在1959年—1965年间，将拨款约九亿兹罗提（波币）用来加速农业教育的发展。
    捷各地重视培养有实际生产知识的青年
    斯洛伐克地区学生普遍受技术教育
    本报讯　目前，在捷克斯洛伐克的斯洛伐克地区，有二十五万普通学校的学生都在受综合技术教育，学生们因此大大扩展了自己的知识领域。其他二万七千个高年级
  （十—十二年级）的学生，已经直接参加了斯洛伐克解放以后建立起来的具有近代设备工厂中工作。
    斯洛伐克的学校数目也在一年年增加。1959年有九百间新建的、光线充足的教室交付使用。今年将增加一千四百二十五间教室。预计在第三个五年计划（1961—1965年）期间斯洛伐克将建成一万间左右的新教室。这等于斯洛伐克在过去八十六年间所建教室的总和。今天，塔特拉山麓下任何一个地区的学校都以前所未有的增长速度大大超过了像法国、加拿大、日本等这样一些国家。
    布拉迪斯拉发城红十字会区一所九年制的中学是新建的学校之一。这所学校同捷克斯洛伐克其他普通学校一样，推行综合技术教育。综合技术教育的基础是在学校的附属工场内和田地上劳动。对高年级学生特别注意教学与参观巨大的机械工厂、机械和装配工场的活动相结合，同时，还利用适合的电影片、幻灯片等来补充工厂的印象和在工场内获得的知识。
    大力培养熟练工人和技术员
    罗马尼亚职业技术学校发展迅速
    本报讯　罗马尼亚的职业和技术教育近年来得到了迅速发展。职业技术教育是要训练经济和社会文化部门的熟练工人和技术员。在1958—1959学年内，罗马尼亚有七百四十所以上的职业、贸易、农业、技术和工长技术学校，学员有十二万七千人以上（1938年时只有二百二十四所职业学校和三万九千多名学员；一百四十二所男女工业学校和一万四千多名学员）。
    职业和技术学校在十年里为各个生产部门培养了二十八万以上的熟练工人和十二万八千名技术员。
    职业徒工学校、农业和贸易学校的学习期限是二至四年；它们在通过入学考试的基础上只招收十四至十七岁的七年制学校的毕业生。这些学校的被培养的学员取得证明不同专门职业的证书。高度熟练工人和技术人员的技术学校只招收十七至二十五岁的持有毕业证书的学员。技术和职业学校的学生参加理论学习，同时也在学校的车间和学校附近的企业里进行实习工作。（附图片）
