The Mystery of the Mermaid
    Yang Min

    As early as the tenth century, China had legends of fish in the sea that resembled humans. According to the book "Cui Yi Ji," during the reign of Emperor Taizong of the Song Dynasty, a man named Cha Dao was sent as an envoy to Goryeo (Korea) and saw a woman in the sea with a red skirt and bare shoulders, her hair disheveled. Cha Dao said this was a mermaid. Xu Xuan's "Ji Shen Lu" also has a similar record.

    Of course, these legends are based on something. However, in ancient times, due to inaccurate observations or deliberate exaggeration, various rare things were described as mysterious and unpredictable. For a long time, people suspected mermaids were ghosts or gods. In recent years, the truth about mermaids has gradually been clarified.

    It turns out that so-called mermaids are actually mammals similar to whales and seals, not fish. In January 1931, one was first obtained at Da Shu Fang on the southern coast of Taiwan, weighing about 400 jin and about 3 meters long. In May 1955, another one was caught on the beach of Gaode Town, Beihai City, Guangdong Province, weighing more than 800 jin and nearly 3 meters long. It has been sent by the aquatic products department to scientific research institutions for dissection and research.

    Mermaids are also known as dugongs. Although they are sea beasts, they look somewhat like fish. The head is slightly round. The hind limbs are degenerated, and the forelimbs are pectoral fin-shaped, about one or two feet long, which looks like a pair of hands at first glance. There is a pair of breasts on the chest. The rear part has a crescent-shaped horizontal tail fin. Using the forelimbs and tail fin, it can support its body and expose its upper body to the surface of the water. When breastfeeding, it holds its young with its forelimbs and browses with the waves. What Cha Dao saw in the past was obviously this situation. The mermaid's body is gray and scaleless. Although it has hair, it is very sparse. The legendary "two hands like humans" and "bare shoulders"...seem to be roughly correct, but what is said about "red skirt" and "disheveled hair" is completely unreliable.

    It is said that in the winter of 1741, Russian explorer and German naturalist Steller explored Alaska in North America. On the way back, they encountered headwinds and drifted to Bering Island. There, they discovered mermaids. It is said that they are now extinct there, because the meat of this mermaid is abundant and delicious, not afraid of people, and slow to move, so they were greedily captured by many whalers, and none were spared.

    Mermaid meat can be eaten fresh or made into dried meat, which tastes delicious. They are highly valued in places like Ryukyu. Like whales, mermaids have a thick layer of fat to replace hair and keep their body temperature. The oil made from it is neither cloudy nor has a bad odor. It is most suitable for patients with lung diseases and those with weak bodies. Its effectiveness is better than that of croaker liver oil. Using it for lighting is bright and lasting, which is very popular in Kamchatka, Ryukyu, and other places.

    The skin of the mermaid is usually about an inch thick and becomes as hard as a board after drying. It is said that people in the Red Sea coast used to like to use it as a material for repairing houses, and also used it as a shield, saying that it could defend against bullets. The Kamchatka people like to use it to build ships. The spine and ribs of the mermaid are large and dense, making them a good substitute for ivory. It is also said that they are used as a sacred medicine for detoxification and hemostasis. The incisors and the first cervical vertebra can also be used as decorations. Many of the medals of the chiefs of small islands in the South Pacific are made of this material.

    The production of mermaids does not seem to be large. It is said that there are only two genera and five species existing. One genus is scientifically called sea cow, and the other is called dugong. The difference between the two is that the forelimbs of the former still have traces of four claws, while the latter does not; the tail fin of the sea cow genus is round, while the tail of the dugong is concave in the center and divided into left and right parts. The mermaid discovered in China is a species in the latter genus.

    Mermaids' favorite environment is shallow areas close to the coast, or in rivers near estuaries. Eelgrass and other nutrient-rich algae are their favorite delicacies. Many people believe that as long as they are given the appropriate conditions, they can be bred in the sea, rivers, or lakes.

    China's "Shan Hai Jing" and "Lin Hai Yi Wu Zhi" and other books also have records about mermaids. However, they refer to giant salamanders. Giant salamanders are also called "baby fish", mainly because their cry sounds like a baby crying, and they are mostly produced in Jiangnan.

    人鱼之谜
    杨旻
    我国远在第十世纪的时候，就已传说海中有一种像人一样的鱼。据“徂异记”一书记载：宋太宗时有一个名叫查道的人出使高丽（朝鲜），看见海上有妇人红裳双袒，髻鬟纷乱。查道说这是人鱼。徐铉的“稽神录”也有相似的记载。
    这种传说当然也是有所根据的。不过古代的人，由于观察不详，或故意夸张渲染，以致把各种比较罕见的事物，描绘得神秘莫测。长期以来，人们一直疑人鱼为鬼为神。到了近年，人鱼的真相才逐渐被弄清楚。
    原来所谓人鱼，实际上是一种和鲸、海豹等相近的哺乳动物，并不是鱼类。1931年1月，第一次在台湾南部海岸大树房地方获得一条，体重约四百斤，体长约三米。1955年5月，又在广东省北海市高德镇的海滩上捕得一条，重八百多斤，长近三米，已由水产部门送交科学研究机构进行解剖研究。
    人鱼又名儒艮。虽是海兽，样子却有点像鱼。头略呈圆形。后肢退化，前肢为胸鳍状，长在一二尺左右，骤看确有些像一双手。胸部有一对乳房。后部有一新月形的水平尾鳍。利用前肢和尾鳍，可以支持身体，把上身露出在水面上。哺乳时，用前肢抱着幼儿，随波浏览。从前查道所看到的，显然就是这种情形。人鱼体呈灰色，无鳞，虽有毛，但极稀少。传说中的“两手如人”“双袒”……看来还大致不差，至于说什么“红裳”、“髻鬟纷乱”却全不可靠了。
  据说在1741年冬，俄国的探险家和德国的博物学者斯忒来尔在北美阿拉斯加探险，归途中遇到逆风，漂流到了白令岛。在那里，他们发现了人鱼。据说现在那里已经绝迹，因为这种人鱼肉多味美，性不畏人，行动又较迟钝，所以被许多猎鲸者贪婪地捕取，竟没有一个能幸免的。
    人鱼的肉可以鲜食，也可以制成干脯，味道鲜美。琉球等地，都非常珍视它。和鲸一样，人鱼具有代替毛发以保体温的肥厚脂肪层，用以制油，既不混浊，又没有恶臭，最宜于肺病患者和身体虚弱的人服用，效能比鳘鱼肝油还要好。用以点灯，光明而耐久，这在堪察加、琉球等地，就很流行。
    人鱼的皮肤，普通厚度都在一寸左右，干后坚硬如板。据说从前红海沿岸地方的人，很喜欢用它作为修葺房屋的材料，也用它作盾，说能防御枪弹。堪察加人喜欢用它来造船。人鱼的脊梁骨和肋骨由于形大、致密，是象牙的良好代用品，传说还有用它作为解毒和止血的圣药的。门齿和第一颈椎也可作装饰品，南洋群岛一些小岛上的酋长的勋章，很多就是用这种材料作成。
    人鱼的产量似乎并不多。据说现存的只有两属，共五种。一属学名海牛，另一属叫儒艮。二者的区别，在于前者的前肢还残存有四个爪的痕迹，后者却没有；海牛属的尾鳍呈圆形，而儒艮的尾，却是中央凹入，分为左右两部分。我国发现的人鱼，便是后一属中的种类。
    人鱼最喜欢的环境是靠近海岸较浅的地方，或近河口的河中。大叶藻等富含营养分的藻类，是它们得意的美餐。很多人认为：只要给它们相当的条件，在海、河或湖泊中都可以繁殖。
    我国“山海经”、“临海异物志”等书中，也有关于人鱼的记载。不过所指的是鲵鱼。鲵鱼又叫娃娃鱼，主要是因为它的叫声似小儿啼哭而得名，江南多有出产。
