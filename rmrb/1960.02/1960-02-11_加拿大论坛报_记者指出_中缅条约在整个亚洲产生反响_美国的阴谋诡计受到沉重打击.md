Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, February 9th. The "Canadian Tribune" published a commentary on February 8th by its Beijing correspondent, Sydney Gordon, stating that the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression between the Chinese and Burmese governments, as well as the agreement on the boundary question between the two countries, are generating repercussions throughout Asia. They are forcefully dismantling the meticulously arranged plans of Washington and its Asian puppets. The article states that the China-Myanmar treaty opens the door to friendship throughout Asia.

Gordon said: "These treaties and agreements demonstrate that the spirit of the Bandung Conference of Asian and African countries cooperating is still a powerful force. They give new prestige to the principle of peaceful coexistence and create the belief that Asian countries can resolve their differences through friendly negotiations."

Gordon said: "These treaties and agreements also deal a heavy blow to those from Tokyo to Washington who are employing the old tricks of conspiracy, buying off small groups of reactionaries within various countries, pitting one country against another, relying on military blocs initiated by the United States, and trying to isolate China..." Gordon said: "Now Asia and the whole world have the opportunity to compare China's words and actions and to measure the integrity of those who accuse China."

    中缅条约在整个亚洲产生反响  美国的阴谋诡计受到沉重打击
    新华社日内瓦9日电  “加拿大论坛报”8日刊载它驻北京记者悉尼·戈登的一篇评论说，中国和缅甸政府签订的友好和互不侵犯条约以及关于两国边界问题的协定正在整个亚洲产生反响，它以巨大的力量拆穿了华盛顿和它的亚洲傀儡们所处心积虑安排的计划。文章说，中缅条约打开了整个亚洲友好的大门。
    戈登说：“这些条约和协定显示，亚非各国合作的原万隆会议精神仍然是一种有力的力量。它们使和平共处原则具有新的威信，并使人相信，亚洲国家能够通过友好谈判来解决它们的分歧。”
    戈登说：“这些条约和协定也猛烈地打击了从东京到华盛顿的这样一些人：他们施展老一套的阴谋诡计，收买各个国家内的一小撮反动派，使一个国家反对另一个国家，依靠美国发起的军事集团，竭力孤立中国……”戈登说：“现在亚洲和全世界已有可能拿中国的言论和行动作一比较，并衡量指责中国的人的正直的程度了。”
