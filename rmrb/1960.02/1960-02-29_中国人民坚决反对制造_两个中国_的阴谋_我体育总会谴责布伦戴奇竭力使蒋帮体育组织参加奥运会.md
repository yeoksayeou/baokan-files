Xinhua News Agency, February 28th. A Xinhua News Agency reporter interviewed the person in charge of the All-China Sports Federation regarding the statement made by International Olympic Committee President Brundage on February 16 concerning allowing the sports organizations of the Chiang Kai-shek clique to participate in the 17th Olympic Games and discussing the acceptance of the sports organizations of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in the next meeting under the name of the so-called "Republic of China Olympic Committee."

The person in charge of the Sports Federation emphasized in his statement to the reporter: "Brundage's approach is being carried out under the instigation of the US government. Its purpose is to make the participation of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's sports organizations in the Olympic Games a fait accompli, in order to confuse the public, manipulate the International Olympic Committee to illegally accept the sports organizations of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and continue to play the conspiracy of 'two Chinas'."

The person in charge of the Sports Federation then said: "Brundage's actions at the 56th session of the International Olympic Committee are just another trick he has always used to play politics. In 1958, after the Chinese Olympic Committee (All-China Sports Federation) solemnly announced the severance of all relations with the International Olympic Committee to protest Brundage's conspiracy of playing 'two Chinas', sports organizations from socialist countries such as the Soviet Union, as well as many fair-minded people in the sports community of various countries, firmly demanded that the sports organizations of the Chiang Kai-shek clique be expelled from the International Olympic Committee. Under this pressure, Brundage had to play a trick at the 55th Munich meeting of the International Olympic Committee in May 1959, and put forward a resolution that was still playing the conspiracy of 'two Chinas'. This resolution pointed out on the one hand that the name 'All-China Olympic Committee' 'will be removed from the list of official Olympic Committees recognized by the International Olympic Committee', but at the same time, it stated that 'if it requests recognition under another name, the International Olympic Committee will consider it'. This is obviously a conspiracy for the sports organizations of the Chiang Kai-shek clique to stay in the International Olympic Committee by changing their appearance. On February 16th this year, Brundage openly issued a statement declaring that the acceptance of the sports organizations of the Chiang Kai-shek clique under the name of the 'Republic of China Olympic Committee' will be discussed at the next meeting of the International Olympic Committee. He also bluntly said that 'I have already suggested this new name, and in my opinion, it will be adopted'. At the same time, in order to create a fait accompli, Brundage illegally allowed the sports organizations of the Chiang Kai-shek clique to participate in the 17th Olympic Games in August this year. It is not difficult to see that Brundage's previous and subsequent actions are just two steps of a conspiracy. No matter how Brundage's methods change, the Chinese people and the people of all countries in the world will never be fooled by him."

The person in charge of the Sports Federation finally solemnly stated: "The Chinese people and athletes resolutely oppose the conspiracy to create 'two Chinas'. No matter what form this conspiracy takes, it will be met with a shameful defeat. There is only one China, and that is the People's Republic of China. Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. The sports organizations in Taiwan can only be a local organization of the All-China Sports Federation. We are firmly opposed to international sports organizations allowing Taiwan to participate in activities separately in any name or form."

Xinhua News Agency, February 28th. The 56th session of the International Olympic Committee was held in San Francisco, USA from February 13th to 16th. Under the manipulation of American Chairman Brundage, the meeting allowed the Chiang gang's sports organizations, whose recognition had been revoked by the International Olympic Committee, to participate in the 17th Olympic Games to be held in Rome in August this year.

This decision once again nakedly shows that Brundage and his ilk, the American chairman of the International Olympic Committee, are resolutely hostile to the Chinese people and are serving the American political conspiracy to create "two Chinas".

As everyone knows, Brundage and his ilk have faithfully implemented the policies of American imperialism under the guise of "sports has nothing to do with politics". In the past, this group of people did everything possible to obstruct the International Olympic Committee from recognizing the legitimate status of the Chinese Olympic Committee (All-China Sports Federation), which is the only one that can represent China. Later, when the obstruction failed, on the one hand, it recognized the Chinese Olympic Committee, and on the other hand, without any discussion or decision, it dragged the so-called "China National Amateur Athletic Federation" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which was spurned by the Chinese people, into the list of national Olympic Committees recognized by the International Olympic Committee.

Due to this action of the International Olympic Committee, which wantonly violated the Olympic Charter and conspired to create "two Chinas," the Chinese Olympic Committee officially announced on August 19, 1958, that it did not recognize the International Olympic Committee and severed all contact with it; and stated that cooperation with them could only be reconsidered when the International Olympic Committee corrected its mistakes and revoked its recognition of the Chiang gang's so-called "China National Amateur Athletic Federation" (China National Amateur Athletic Federation).

The solemn position of the Chinese Olympic Committee has won the sympathy and support of fair world public opinion, especially the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. In a letter to the chairman, members of the International Olympic Committee, and national Olympic committees on December 26, 1958, the Soviet Olympic Committee pointed out that only the Olympic Committee of the People's Republic of China (All-China Sports Federation) has the right to represent Chinese athletes in the international Olympic movement.

Then, at the 55th session of the International Olympic Committee held in Munich in May 1959, the Soviet Olympic Committee put forward a proposal. The proposal stated that the International Olympic Committee recognizes that there is only one Olympic Committee in China, and that is the Olympic Committee of the People's Republic of China (All-China Sports Federation). Therefore, the "China National Amateur Athletic Federation (Taiwan)" should be removed from the list of national Olympic Committees recognized by the International Olympic Committee.

The Soviet proposal was supported by all fair-minded people. The vast majority of speeches at the meeting believed that the recognition of the so-called "Olympic Committee" in Taiwan was illegal. Most members of the International Olympic Committee believed that there is only one China with 650 million people in the world. All of this proves people's dissatisfaction with Brundage and others' practice of supporting the Chiang gang's sports organizations and stealing China's position, and also proves that the policy of hating the People's Republic of China is becoming increasingly unpopular in the international sports community.

Under this situation, Brundage played a new trick, he put forward a resolution and let the conference pass it. The resolution said, "The Secretary-General of the International Olympic Committee will notify the China National Amateur Athletic Federation, whose headquarters are in Taipei (Taiwan), that it cannot continue to be recognized under this name because it cannot control 'China's' domestic sports activities, and its name will be removed from the list of official Olympic Committees recognized by the International Olympic Committee. If it requests recognition under another name, the International Olympic Committee will consider it."

This resolution tampered with the content of the Soviet proposal, on the one hand, temporarily removing the name of the Chiang gang's sports organization from the official list recognized by the International Olympic Committee in order to cover up people's eyes and ears. On the other hand, it set aside the fundamental argument in the Soviet proposal that only the All-China Sports Federation can represent China. In this way, not only was the revocation of recognition of the Chiang gang turned into a matter of simply changing the name, but it also attempted to steal the day and change the world to allow the Chiang gang's sports organizations to stay in the International Olympic Committee after going around in circles. This is consistent with the political conspiracy of the United States to separate Taiwan from China and become a de facto political entity.

Since the end of the 55th session of the International Olympic Committee, Brundage has been racking his brains to find a way to allow the Chiang gang to rejoin the International Olympic Committee.

After the end of the 56th session of the International Olympic Committee, the essence of the problem became clearer. On February 16, Brundage read out a pre-prepared formal statement from the International Olympic Committee. In this statement, the Munich Conference resolution was changed to: "Since the Taipei (Olympic) Committee does not govern the Olympic movement in mainland China, but governs the Olympic movement in Taiwan, its name should be changed accordingly. Therefore, it is decided that its name must be changed to a name other than China."

Brundage also said, "The name will be decided at the International Olympic Committee meeting to be held in Rome in August this year. Before that time, in order to prevent Taiwanese athletes from being excluded from the 17th Olympic Games, the International Olympic Committee authorized its executive committee to allow Taiwan, which currently calls itself the 'Republic of China Olympic Committee', to participate in the Games." This shows that Brundage and his ilk, under the instruction of the US State Department, hurriedly took the first step to try to pull the Chiang gang's sports organizations into the Olympic Games in order to create a fait accompli for the Chiang gang's participation in the Olympic movement, and prepare for the Chiang gang's sports organizations to drill into the International Olympic Committee again after going around in circles. Regarding the name of the Chiang gang's sports organizations, the so-called "Republic of China Olympic Committee," Brundage also said bluntly, "I have already suggested this new name, and in my opinion, it will be adopted."

Brundage's face of insisting on playing the political conspiracy of "two Chinas" has been completely exposed. The Chinese people resolutely oppose this conspiracy. There is only one China, and that is the People's Republic of China. Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. Taiwan's sports organizations can only be a local organization of the All-China Sports Federation. The Chinese people firmly oppose international sports organizations allowing Taiwan to participate in activities separately in any name or form.

    中国人民坚决反对制造“两个中国”的阴谋
    我体育总会谴责布伦戴奇竭力使蒋帮体育组织参加奥运会
    新华社28日讯　新华社记者就国际奥委会主席布伦戴奇2月16日发表的关于允许蒋介石集团的体育组织参加第十七届奥林匹克运动会并将在下届会议上讨论以所谓“中华民国奥委会”名义接纳蒋介石集团的体育组织问题的声明，访问了中华全国体育总会负责人。
    体总负责人对记者发表谈话时首先强调指出：“布伦戴奇的这种做法是在美国官方的指使下进行的。其目的是企图使蒋介石集团的体育组织参加奥运会成为既成事实，以便混淆视听，操纵国际奥委会非法接纳蒋介石集团的体育组织，继续玩弄‘两个中国’的阴谋。”
    体总负责人接着说：“布伦戴奇这次在国际奥委会第五十六届会议上的做法，只是他一贯玩弄政治的又一次花样。1958年在中国奥林匹克委员会（中华全国体育总会）庄严宣布同国际奥委会断绝一切关系，以抗议布伦戴奇玩弄‘两个中国’的阴谋后，苏联等社会主义国家体育组织以及各国体育界许多公正人士，坚决要求把蒋介石集团的体育组织逐出国际奥委会。迫于这种形势，布伦戴奇不得不在1959年5月国际奥委会第五十五届慕尼黑会议上，耍了一个花招，提出了一个仍然是玩弄
  ‘两个中国’阴谋的决议。这个决议一方面指出，‘中华全国奥委会’的名称‘将从国际奥委会所承认的正式奥委会名单中取消’，但同时又称，‘如果它用其他名称要求承认的话，国际奥委会将予以考虑’。这显然是要蒋介石集团的体育组织用改头换面的办法赖在国际奥委会的一个阴谋。今年2月16日，布伦戴奇公然发表声明，宣称将在下届国际奥委会会议上讨论以‘中华民国奥委会’的名义接纳蒋介石集团的体育组织。他还毫不讳言‘我已经建议过这个新名称，在我看，它将得到通过’。同时为了造成既成事实，布伦戴奇竟非法允许蒋介石集团的体育组织参加今年8月第十七届奥运会。不难看出，布伦戴奇的前后作法，只不过是一个阴谋的两个步骤而已。不管布伦戴奇的手法如何变换，中国人民和世界各国人民是决不会上他的当的。”
    体总负责人最后郑重申明：“中国人民和运动员坚决反对制造‘两个中国’的阴谋。不管这个阴谋以什么方式出现，都将遭到可耻的失败。中国只有一个，那就是中华人民共和国。台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分。台湾的体育组织只能是中华全国体育总会的一个地方组织。国际体育组织以任何名义，任何形式容许台湾单独参加活动，都是我们所坚决反对的。”
    新华社28日讯　国际奥林匹克委员会第五十六届会议于2月13日到16日在美国旧金山举行。会议在美国主席布伦戴奇操纵下，允许已被国际奥委会撤销承认的蒋帮体育组织参加今年8月在罗马举行的第十七届奥林匹克运动会。
    这个决定再一次赤裸裸地表明，国际奥委会中美国主席布伦戴奇之流坚决与中国人民为敌，并为美国制造“两个中国”的政治阴谋效劳。
    大家知道，布伦戴奇之流一直在“体育与政治无关”的幌子下忠实地执行美国帝国主义的政策。这批人过去就百般阻挠国际奥委会承认唯一能代表中国的中国奥林匹克委员会（中华全国体育总会）的合法地位。后来在阻挠不成的情况下，一方面承认中国奥委会，另一方面又未经任何讨论和决定，把中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石集团的所谓“中华全国体育协进会”拖进了国际奥委会所承认的国家奥委会的名单中。
    由于国际奥林匹克委员会这种肆意破坏奥林匹克宪章、阴谋制造“两个中国”的行动，中国奥委会于1958年8月19日正式宣布不承认国际奥林匹克委员会，断绝同它的一切联系；并表示只有当国际奥委会改正错误，撤销承认蒋帮的所谓“中华全国奥委会”（中华全国体育协进会）时，才能重新考虑同它们的合作问题。
    中国奥林匹克委员会的严正立场得到了世界公正舆论，特别是苏联和其他社会主义国家的同情和支持。苏联奥林匹克委员会在1958年12月26日给国际奥委会主席、委员及各国奥委会的信中指出，国际奥林匹克运动中只有中华人民共和国奥委会（中华全国体育总会）才有权代表中国运动员。
    接着，在1959年5月在慕尼黑举行的国际奥林匹克委员会第五十五届会议上，苏联奥林匹克委员会又提出提案。提案说，国际奥委会承认在中国只有一个奥林匹克委员会，这就是中华人民共和国奥林匹克委员会（中华全国体育总会）。因此，应从国际奥委会所承认的国家奥委会名单中除去“中华全国奥委会（台湾）”。
    苏联的提案得到了所有公正人士的支持。会议上绝大部分发言都认为，对在台湾的所谓“奥委会”的承认，是非法的。大部分国际奥林匹克委员都认为，世界上只有一个六亿五千万人民的中国。这一切都证明了人们对于布伦戴奇等人扶植蒋帮体育组织，窃据中国地位的做法的不满，也证明了在国际体育界中仇视中华人民共和国的政策越来越不得人心。
    在这种形势下，布伦戴奇又使出了一个新的花招，他提出了一个决议案，并让大会通过。决议说，“国际奥委会秘书长将通知会址设在台北（台湾）的中华全国奥委会，它不能继续以这个名义被承认，因为它不能控制‘中国’国内的体育活动，它的名称将从国际奥委会所承认的正式奥委会名单中取消。如果它用其他名称要求承认的话，国际奥委会将予以考虑。”
    这个决议篡改了苏联提案的内容，一方面暂时把蒋帮体育组织的名称从国际奥委会所承认的正式名单中取消，以遮掩人们的耳目。另一方面，却撇开了苏联提案中关于只有中华全国体育总会才能代表中国这一根本论点。这样，不仅把撤销对蒋帮的承认变成一个只是更改名称的问题，而且企图偷天换日地使蒋帮体育组织在外面绕一个圈后，又改头换面赖在国际奥委会里面。这是和美国企图使台湾脱离中国而成为事实上存在的政治单位的政治阴谋是一致的。
    第五十五届国际奥委会会议结束以来，布伦戴奇就费尽心机，寻找使蒋帮重新加入国际奥委会的办法。
    在第五十六届国际奥委会会议结束后，问题的实质更清楚了。2月16日，布伦戴奇宣读了一个事前准备好的国际奥委会的正式声明。在这个声明中，慕尼黑会议的决议一变而为：“由于台北（奥林匹克）委员会不能管辖大陆中国的奥林匹克运动，但是却管辖着台湾的奥林匹克运动，它的名称应作相应的更改。因此，决定它的名称必须改成中国以外的称呼。”
    布伦戴奇又说，“关于名称将于今年8月在罗马举行的国际奥委会会议上决定。到那个时候以前，为了使台湾的选手不致被排斥于第十七届奥林匹克运动会之外，国际奥委会授权它的执行委员会准许目前自称为‘中华民国奥委会’的台湾参加运动会。”这说明，布伦戴奇之流已经在美国国务院的指使下赶紧第一步设法把蒋帮体育组织拉进奥运会，以图造成蒋帮参加奥林匹克运动的既成事实，为蒋帮体育组织在绕一圈后再钻进国际奥委会作好准备。对于蒋帮体育组织的所谓“中华民国奥委会”的名称，布伦戴奇还露骨地说，“我已经建议过这个新名称，在我看来，它将得到通过”。
    布伦戴奇坚持玩弄“两个中国”的政治阴谋的嘴脸，已经暴露无遗了。中国人民坚决反对这种阴谋。中国只有一个，那就是中华人民共和国，台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分。台湾体育组织只能是中华全国体育总会的一个地方组织。国际体育组织以任何名义、任何形式容许台湾单独参加活动，都是中国人民所坚决反对的。
