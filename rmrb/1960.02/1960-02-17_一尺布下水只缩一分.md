    One Foot of Cloth Shrinks Only One Fen After Washing
    (Our dispatch) Shanghai National Second Printing and Dyeing Factory has created a "Leap Forward Pre-Shrinking Finishing Machine" that can prevent the shrinkage of printed and dyed cloth. Using it to process printed and dyed cloth, the shrinkage rate has reached the level required by the international market. This machine is now being officially promoted in more than ten printing and dyeing factories in Shanghai, and printing and dyeing machinery factories have also begun mass production.
    The international market requires that the shrinkage rate of printed and dyed cloth should not exceed 1%. In the past, due to the lack of machines and equipment to prevent the shrinkage of printed and dyed cloth in our country, cotton cloth often naturally elongated by 3% to 8% during the printing and dyeing process. Now, with this pre-shrinking finishing machine, the shrinkage rate of printed and dyed cloth can be reduced to below 1%, and the cloth becomes softer and the texture becomes clearer, making it a high-end product.

    一尺布下水只缩一分
    本报讯　上海国营第二印染厂创制了一种可以预防印染布缩水的“跃进式预缩整理机”。用它处理印染布，缩水率达到了国际市场所要求的水平。这种机器目前已在上海市十多家印染工厂正式推广，印染机械厂也已开始大量生产。
    国际市场要求印染布的缩水率不得超过1％。过去由于我国缺乏预防印染布缩水的机器设备，棉布在印染过程中，常常自然伸长3％至8％。现在有了这种预缩整理机，印染布的缩水率就可以下降到1％以下，而且布质变得柔软，纹路更加清晰，可以成为高档产品。
