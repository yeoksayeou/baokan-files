Cultivate Lofty Ambitions, Add Drive, Surpass the "Program" in One Season
Guangfeng County Aims for 800 Jin Per Mu for Early Rice
Wenshan Autonomous Prefecture Changes from Single-Season to Double-Season, Triple-Season Planting

    This newspaper reports that Guangfeng County in Jiangxi Province, which exceeded 1,000 jin per mu in grain production last year, is focusing on early rice production this year, striving for a yield of 800 jin per mu. This is an increase of nearly double from the 400-plus jin per mu last year, achieving a single-season output that surpasses the production target stipulated in the National Program for Agricultural Development.

    Recently, the People's Communes in Guangfeng County have used the high-yield target of 800 jin of early rice per mu as a yardstick to examine the preparedness of existing yield-increasing measures such as water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, and seedlings. They discovered that many facilities could not meet the demands of the high-yield target, and some cadres lacked the drive to strive for high early rice yields. To ensure the realization of the high-yield target for early rice, the county party committee believes that the first step is to instill the idea of achieving the high-yield target in the minds of the majority of cadres, thereby unifying ideological understanding and ensuring the intensification of measures. Last year, Guangfeng County's grain yield exceeded 1,000 jin per mu, leading to the thought of "reaching the top of high yield" among some cadres in high-yield areas. In low-yield areas, there were also arguments of "poor conditions," adhering to a condition-centric view. In response to these ideas, the county party committee organized a forum and debate at the five-level cadre meeting, arming the cadres' minds with the theory of continuous revolution. At the same time, the fact that Hebei Commune achieved high early rice yields last year was used to educate the cadres, giving them the confidence that a single season of early rice can surpass the grain target stipulated in the National Program for Agricultural Development.

    To strengthen the leadership over early rice production, the county party committee, in addition to establishing an early rice production command center, also dispatched sixteen county party committee members to concurrently serve as commune party secretaries. Each commune party committee dispatched more than two hundred party committee members to concurrently serve as production brigade branch secretaries. The county party committee standing committee members adopted a method of dividing and contracting areas to fix leadership regions.

    On the basis of strengthened leadership and consistent cadre thinking, the county party committee decided to further implement the early rice production plan among the masses. In addition to extensively mobilizing commune members to contribute ideas and suggestions, each commune organized three thousand cadres to visit commune members and collect effective measures for increasing early rice production. Based on the ideas and suggestions of the majority of commune members, the county party committee, with the high-yield target of early rice production surpassing the National Program for Agricultural Development as a yardstick for inspecting preparations for plowing, comprehensively examined the preparedness of water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, and other tasks. In terms of water conservancy, before the high-yield target for early rice was raised, many cadres believed that the amount of water stored was sufficient for early rice irrigation. However, according to the calculation based on this year's target of 800 jin of early rice per mu, the existing water volume was far from enough, with more than 20,000 mu of terraced fields completely lacking water conservancy facilities. The inconsistency between the target and the measures aroused great attention from the county party committee and commune party committees, and immediately added a water conservancy construction task of 3 million cubic meters of earthwork, and opened up a ring-mountain canal, so that 240,000 mu of early rice fields in the county could resist a 120-day drought.

    In terms of fertilizer, it was found that the amount required for the high-yield target of early rice differed even more. After calculating the required fertilizer amount in relation to the high-yield target of early rice, a new upsurge in accumulating and producing fertilizer was launched in each commune. Now, the number of people participating in fertilizer accumulation every day in the county has reached 100,000. The county party committee has transferred labor from communes without water conservancy tasks to support Hengfeng and several other communes with heavy water conservancy tasks and no way to spare labor for fertilizer accumulation. Now, the county has prepared enough fertilizer needed for high early rice yields.

    Originally, it was thought that there were no problems with soil improvement and seed preparation, but after measuring it with the high-yield target of early rice, many problems were also discovered. Various communes have taken effective measures to make up for the deficiencies.

    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province intercrops and interplants various crops in the fields, doing everything possible to change single-season crops into double-season and triple-season crops, striving to achieve multiple planting, high yield, and increased harvest in grain production this year.

    This year, the autonomous prefecture is preparing for spring plowing early, and spring sowing has also started early. As of February 8, the prefecture had sown more than 800,000 mu of various early-maturing crops such as rice, corn, buckwheat, and beans, more than doubling the area compared with the same period last year. At the same time, tens of thousands of mu of high-yield feed crops such as cassava, banana taro, and melons were sown, and a large number of middle-season rice seedlings were cultivated, creating conditions for changing single-season crops into double-season and triple-season crops this year. The early-sown early-maturing crops are mostly lush green, with strong and uniform seedlings.

    Wenshan Autonomous Prefecture is located on the Tropic of Cancer, with a warm climate and a long frost-free period, which is very suitable for crop growth. In recent years, due to the expansion of cultivated land area and the conscientious implementation of the production policy of multiple planting, high yield, and increased harvest, grain production has grown rapidly. In 1959, grain production increased by more than double compared with 1957, with an average of 1,224 jin of grain per person in the prefecture. At the beginning of this year, the people of all ethnic groups, based on summing up the experiences of the great leap forward in agriculture in the past two years, formulated a continued leap forward production plan. The plan stipulates that this year, the prefecture will expand the planting of feed crops, vigorously develop pig raising, expand the planting of cash crops, and realize diversified operations. At the same time, it will also reclaim wasteland to expand cultivated land area, plant early and plant more, and change one planting and one harvest a year into multiple plantings and multiple harvests a year. So far, more than 620,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed in the prefecture, expanding the cultivated land area by nearly 20% compared with the same period last year. In mid-January, there was a widespread spring rain of six to seven millimeters in various parts of the prefecture. Party committees at all levels seized the favorable opportunity of "early spring rain heralds a bumper year," and convened telephone conferences at all levels to mobilize the masses to start planting early-maturing crops on a large scale, making the sowing season one or two solar terms earlier than in previous years; and vigorously promote intercropping and interplanting of early-maturing crops, mid-season crops, and late autumn crops.

    树雄心　添干劲　一季超“纲要”
    广丰县要早稻亩产八百斤
    文山自治州改单季为双季、三季种植
    本报讯　去年粮食亩产超千斤的江西广丰县，今年大抓早稻生产，争取亩产八百斤，比去年亩产四百多斤增产近一倍，做到一季产量跨过农业纲要规定的产量指标。
    最近，广丰县各人民公社都以早稻亩产八百斤的高产指标作为尺度，检查了现有的水、肥、土、种、秧等项增产措施的准备情况，发现许多设施还不能适应高产指标的要求，而且部分干部还缺乏争取早稻高产的干劲。县委为了使早稻高产指标能够实现，认为首先要在广大干部中树立实现高产指标的思想，从而在统一思想认识的基础上，做到措施加码。去年广丰县粮食亩产量超过千斤，这使部分高产地区的干部产生了“高产到顶”的思想；部分低产地区又有“条件不好”等唯条件论。针对这些思想，县委在五级干部大会上组织了鸣放辩论，以不断革命的理论武装了广大干部的思想；同时还以河北公社去年早稻高产的事实，教育了干部，使他们树立了早稻一季产量可以跨过农业纲要粮食指标的信心。
    县委为了加强对早稻生产的领导，除了成立早稻生产指挥部外，又派出了十六个县委委员兼任公社党委书记，各公社党委派出二百多名党委委员兼生产大队支部书记，各县委常委则采取分片包干的办法，固定了领导地区。
    在领导力量加强和干部思想一致的基础上，县委决定进一步把早稻产量计划落实到群众中去。各公社除广泛发动社员献计献策外，还组织了三千名干部登门拜访社员，收集有关早稻增产的有效措施。根据广大社员的献计献策，县委又以早稻产量跨纲要的高产指标作为检查备耕的尺度，全面检查了水、肥、土、种等项工作的准备情况。水利方面，在没有提高早稻高产指标以前，许多干部都认为蓄水量足够早稻灌溉之用；但是根据今年早稻亩产八百斤的指标计算，现有的水量则相差很远，其中有二万多亩梯田根本没有水利设施。指标和措施不一致的情况，引起了县委和公社党委极大的重视，立即增加了三百万方土方的水利兴修任务，开辟了环山渠道，使全县二十四万亩早稻田都能抗御一百二十天的大旱。
    在肥料方面，发现离早稻高产指标所需数量相差更大。经过以早稻高产指标与肥料对口算账以后，各个公社都掀起了新的积肥造肥高潮，现在全县每天参加积肥的人数达到十万人。县委对横峰等几个水利任务重、没有办法抽出劳力积肥的公社，已从没有水利任务的公社抽调劳动力支援。现在，全县已经备足了早稻高产所需要的肥料。
    本来认为土壤改良、种子准备等工作没有什么问题，但是经过用早稻高产指标一衡量，也发现了许多问题。各公社已经采取有效措施进行补课。
    据新华社讯　云南省文山僮族苗族自治州在各种作物地里间作套种，千方百计地变一季作物为双季、三季作物，力争今年粮食生产达到多种、高产、多收。
    今年自治州春耕生产准备早，春播工作也开始早。到2月8日，全州已春播水稻、包谷、荞麦、豆类等各种早熟作物八十多万亩，比去年同期扩大了两倍以上；同时，春播木薯、芭蕉芋、瓜类等高产饲料作物数十万亩，培育了大批中稻小秧，为今年变单季作物为双季、三季作物创造了条件。先播早熟作物大部已一片油绿，苗棵健壮整齐。
    文山自治州位于北回归线上，气候温暖，无霜期长，很适合农作物生长。几年来，由于扩大了耕地面积，认真贯彻了多种、高产、多收的生产方针，粮食产量增长很快，1959年比1957年粮食增加了一倍还多，全州平均每人有粮一千二百二十四斤。今年年初，各族人民在总结两年来农业大跃进经验的基础上，制订了继续跃进的生产规划。规划规定：今年全州一方面要扩种饲料作物、大力发展养猪，扩种经济作物、实现多种经营；同时还要垦荒扩大耕地面积，早种多种，改一年一种一熟为一年多种多熟。到目前为止，全州已垦荒六十二万多亩，比去年同期扩大耕地面积近20％。1月中旬，全州各地普降六至七毫米春雨，各级党委又抓住“春雨早来兆丰年”的有利时机，层层召开电话会议，动员群众开始大种早熟作物，使播种季节比往年提前一至两个节令；大力推广早熟作物、中季作物和晚秋作物间作、套种。
