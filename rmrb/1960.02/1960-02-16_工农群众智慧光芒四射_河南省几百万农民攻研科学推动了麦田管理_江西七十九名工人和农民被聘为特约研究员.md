The Wisdom of Workers and Peasants Shines
Several Million Henan Peasants Study Science to Promote Wheat Field Management
Seventy-Nine Workers and Peasants in Jiangxi Hired as Special Researchers

    (Our Dispatch) Several million peasants in Henan Province have thrown themselves into agricultural scientific research activities and achieved brilliant results. Now, 67 farmers in the province have been hired by the Henan Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences as special researchers.

    Every people's commune in Henan Province has established agricultural science research stations, experimental farms, and weather observation posts; most communes have research offices for various crops and have established a crop archive system based on the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture"; 80% of production brigades have agricultural science research groups and experimental fields. The research content of each commune includes soil properties, meteorological observation, crop field management, pest and disease control, breeding of superior varieties, and manufacturing of advanced fertilizers. Many commune experimental farms are divided into more than a dozen experimental areas to conduct complex comparative experiments on dozens of wheat varieties, comparing tillage depth, sowing date, sowing amount, sowing method, fertilization, irrigation amount, vernalization, hybridization, and more. In order to realize the desire of "harvesting two seasons of wheat a year," many commune experimental farms have opened "seasonal wheat experimental areas." Some experimental farms have wheat planted in July of last year that is now heading. The experimental farm of Chengguan People's Commune in Meng County has cultivated more than 300 varieties of wheat. Many commune members are meticulously carrying out the breeding of hundreds of wheat varieties and tens of thousands of wheat hybridization experiments. At present, according to rough estimates, there are 140,000 mass wheat experiment projects throughout the province, with tens of millions of commune members participating in research activities. Among them, one million backbone members are called technicians by the farmers and are scattered in every production team throughout the province.

    The most basic characteristic of this mass scientific research team is that it can serve production and the central task in accordance with the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture." Last year, one million commune members helped relevant departments of the province complete the province's soil survey, enabling most communes to reasonably deploy crop planting areas according to soil properties. In the past two years, commune members have cultivated 100 excellent wheat varieties, which have been identified and widely promoted throughout the province; they yield 15%-150% more than ordinary varieties. The experimental farms of various communes also adopt the method of "taking the first step" to ensure that all advanced technologies are first tested and then promoted to the large fields. It has become the technical guidance station for the commune party committee to guide crop field management. The field management on-site meetings of the commune and team party committees are almost all held in experimental farms or experimental fields. In the past year or so, the Shangqiao Commune Party Committee in Changge County has held more than 100 crop management on-site meetings at the Taipingdian Experimental Farm, which has powerfully promoted the entire work of the commune. The 130 types of wheat archive data of the Chengguan Commune Experimental Farm in Meng County and the "Wheat Cultivation Study" written by commune members have become valuable data for the Meng County Party Committee to guide wheat field management throughout the county. The current wheat field management is the focus of agricultural scientific research in various communes and production brigades. The experimental farms of five communes including Baidaokou in Hua County, based on the daily wheat development and tillering archive data, divide the wheat in the county into types such as fertilizer deficiency, water deficiency, inter-tillage, soil loosening, compaction, and alkali drainage, and propose different measures to promote wheat field management throughout the county. The agricultural science research station of Liaohe Commune in Nanyang County, through soil moisture measurement research, measured that the soil moisture content was still insufficient after heavy snow, and organized commune members to visit their experimental farm, which made commune members consciously set off a winter irrigation upsurge. This mass scientific research activity has raised the wheat field management in Henan Province this year to a new level.

    The spirit of study and research of the vast number of commune members is very touching. In order to be able to use experimental instruments, they can study and research the instruction manuals on the instruments all night long. Liu Jingcai, a commune member of Shuangba People's Commune in Shangqiu County, studied relevant books after graduating from literacy in order to manufacture advanced fertilizers and created 13 types of advanced fertilizers. Many commune members have carried out hundreds of grafting experiments on fruit trees and crops, and their aspiration is "to make every plant and tree serve the people." Dang Kekui, an agricultural soil expert in Meng County, has worked hard for two years and can now read many professional scientific publications, and can skillfully explain the root development of wheat, the structure of stems and leaves, and a set of scientific field management methods, etc.

    (Our Dispatch) The Jiangxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences recently held a grand ceremony to hire 79 workers and peasants who have made significant achievements in scientific work as special researchers.

    This group of workers and peasants who have been hired as special researchers are red scientific and technical workers who have emerged on various fronts such as industry, agriculture, transportation, finance, trade, culture, education, and health. Among them are nationally renowned technical innovation experts Zhao Changsheng, Zhou Bingshan, and Jing Zilin, and famous labor models and advanced producers Peng Guangxian and He Laiwei. Some of them have become technicians in factories and mines, and some are also serving as leaders in grassroots scientific research departments. Like other working people, they were deprived of the opportunity and right to engage in scientific research by the ruling class in the old society. After liberation, science opened its doors to all working people, and the party and the state created convenient conditions and opportunities for them to conduct scientific research in various aspects. When the party issued the great call of "science for all," they took the lead in responding, acted one after another, closely combined with various productions, and actively and diligently carried out various scientific and technological experiments and researches. For example, Jing Zilin, a female worker in the Jiangxi Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory, used to be a maid before liberation, and only after liberation did she get rid of her slave status and enter the factory as a worker. In the past few years, under the cultivation and education of the party, she has learned to operate the machine and repair the machine, and has become an outstanding advanced producer. Jian Baochun used to be a carpenter, and last year he invented a crawler-type earth-moving machine, which greatly improved the efficiency of earth-moving on water conservancy construction sites.

    This group of special researchers have waged resolute struggles against bourgeois ideology in carrying out scientific research activities. They listened to the party, broke superstitions, emancipated their minds, and displayed the communist style of daring to think, dare to do, and dare to boldly create, and exerted the wisdom and talents possessed by the working people, made remarkable achievements, created miracles, and promoted production. For example, Nie Shoumao, a farmer from the Ledou Brigade of the Shuanggang Commune in Boyang County, with the help of the party branch, broke the "conclusion" that cotton cannot be subjected to distant hybridization, and used Dai Zi cotton and Yang Kui for distant hybridization to cultivate a kind of "insect-resistant cotton," which has obtained more than 4,000 third-generation varieties last year. Another example is Zeng Yongwu, a commune member of the Jinrui People's Commune in Yichun County, who worked hard and carefully cultivated for a long time and finally cultivated a new variety of drought-resistant and high-yielding "28-ridge" sesame. Wang Sanyang, the director of the workshop of the Fuzhou Farm Implement Factory, was originally a turner. Last year, he responded to the call of the party and led all the workers in the workshop to boldly reform the manual operation tools. In less than a year, the factory has fully realized the mechanization of sawing, drilling, planing, etc., and the work efficiency has increased by about five times compared to the past.

    工农群众智慧光芒四射
    河南省几百万农民攻研科学推动了麦田管理
    江西七十九名工人和农民被聘为特约研究员
    本报讯　河南省几百万农民投入农业科学研究活动，并取得了辉煌成就。现在，全省已有六十七位农民，被中国农业科学院河南省分院聘请为特约研究员。
    河南省的每一个人民公社都建立了农业科学研究站、试验场、气象哨；大部分公社有各种作物的研究室，并根据农业“八字宪法”，建立了作物档案资料制；80％的生产大队有农业科学研究小组和试验田。各公社的研究内容，包括土壤性能、气象观测、作物田间管理、病虫害防治、优良品种的繁育、高级化肥的制造等。有许多公社的试验场划分为十几个试验区，对几十种小麦品种进行比较复杂的翻地深度、播种期、播种量、播种方法、施肥、浇水量以及春化、杂交等对比试验。为了实现“一年收两季小麦”的愿望，许多公社的试验场开辟了“节令小麦试验区”。有些试验场，去年7月下种的小麦，现在吐穗了。孟县城关人民公社的试验场，培育了三百多种小麦品种。许多社员精心地进行着百种小麦品种繁育和几万棵小麦杂交试验。现在，全省群众性的小麦试验项目，据粗略统计有十四万个，参加研究活动的社员上千万。其中，有一百万骨干被农民称做技术员，分散在全省每一个生产队。
    这支群众性的科学研究活动队伍，最基本的特点是能根据农业“八字宪法”为生产服务，为中心工作服务。去年，有一百万社员帮助省的有关部门完成了全省的土壤普查工作，使大部分公社都能按照土壤性能合理部署作物种植区。近两年来，社员们已经培育出一百个小麦优良品种，经过鉴定已在全省普遍推广；它们比一般品种增产15％—150％。各公社的试验场，还采取“先走一步”的办法，使一切先进技术首先经过试验，然后向大田推广。它成了公社党委指导作物田间管理的技术指导站。社、队党委的田间管理现场会议，几乎都在试验场或试验田召开。一年多来，长葛县和尚桥公社党委在太平店试验场召开过作物管理现场会议一百多次，有力地推动了公社的整个工作。孟县城关公社试验场的一百三十种小麦档案资料和社员们写的“麦作学”，成了孟县党委指导全县麦田管理的可贵资料。当前的麦田管理，是各公社和生产大队农业科学研究的中心。滑县的白道口等五个公社的试验场，就根据每天小麦发育分蘖的档案资料，把全县小麦分成缺肥、缺水、中耕、松土、镇压、排碱等类型，并提出不同措施，推动了全县麦田管理。南阳县潦河公社的农业科学研究站通过测墒研究，测出在大雪过后，土质含水量仍然不足的情况，组织社员到他们的试验场来参观，使社员自觉地掀起冬灌高潮。这种群众性的科学研究活动，使河南省今年的麦田管理提高到一个新的水平。
    广大社员学习研究的精神是很感动人的。为了会使用试验仪器，他们可以成夜地学习研究仪器上的说明书。商丘县双八人民公社社员刘敬才为了制造高级化肥，扫盲毕业以后，就钻研有关书本，创造了十三种高级化肥。有许多社员，进行了几百种果树和作物的嫁接试验，他们的志愿是“让一草一木都为人民服务”。孟县的农业土专家党可魁，两年来苦心钻研，已经能阅读许多专业科学刊物，能熟练地讲解小麦的根系发育状况，茎叶的构造和一套科学的田间管理方法等。

    本报讯　中国科学院江西分院于最近举行隆重仪式，聘请七十九名在科学工作上有显著成绩的工人、农民为特约研究员。
    这一批被聘请为特约研究员的工人、农民，是全省工业、农业、交通运输、财经贸易、文教卫生等各个战线上，涌现出来的红色科学技术工作者。他们之中有全国闻名的技术革新能手赵长生、周炳山、经自麟，和著名的劳动模范、先进生产者彭光贤、何来为等人。他们有的已经成了厂矿企业的技术员，有的还担任着基层科学研究部门的领导工作。他们和其他劳动人民一样，在旧社会被统治阶级剥夺了从事科学研究工作的机会和权力。解放以后，科学向全体劳动人民敞开了大门，党和国家从各方面给他们创造了进行科学研究的便利条件和机会。当党发出了“全民办科学”的伟大号召以后，他们带头响应，纷纷行动起来，密切结合各项生产，积极刻苦地进行着各种科学技术试验和研究。如江西棉纺织印染厂女工经自麟，解放以前是给人做丫头的，解放以后才摆脱了奴隶的身份，进工厂当了工人。几年来，她在党的培养教育下，学会挡车，修理机器，成了出色的先进生产者。简保春过去是一个木匠，在去年发明了一种履带式的运土机，大大地提高了水利工地上的运土效率。
    这批特约研究员，在进行科学研究活动中都曾经与资产阶级思想进行了坚决的斗争。他们听党的话，破除迷信，解放思想，发挥了敢想敢干、敢于大胆创造的共产主义风格，发挥了劳动人民所具有的智慧和才能，做出了显著的成就，创造了奇迹，促进了生产。如波阳县双港公社乐斗大队农民聂寿茂，在党支部的帮助下，打破了棉花不能进行远缘杂交的“定论”，利用岱字棉和秧葵进行了远缘杂交，培育出了一种“抗虫棉”，去年已取得了四千多株第三代品种。再如宜春县金瑞人民公社社员曾永五，刻苦钻研，经过长期的精心培育，终于培育出了一种耐旱高产的“28棱”芝麻的新品种。抚州市农具厂车间主任王三阳，原来是一个车工，去年他响应了党的号召，带领全车间工人大胆地改革手工操作工具，不到一年时间，这个厂从锯料、打眼、刨料等已全部实现了机械化，工作效率比过去提高了五倍左右。　（赵成安）
