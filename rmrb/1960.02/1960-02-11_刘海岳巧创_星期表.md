Liu Haiyue Cleverly Creates a "Week Watch"
Ke Bingfan

In the Bingcun Commune of Meixian County, Guangdong, there is a very simple clock and watch factory with only twenty-six people. Besides some simple repair tools and a few vises, it can be said that there is nothing else. But in such a factory, a "week watch" has been produced, which even professionals may not have heard of. This watch can run for seven days with one winding; it has large three hands, twenty-one jewels, and is water-resistant, shock-resistant, and anti-magnetic. As for its accuracy, it only loses half a minute in a month. All the parts of the watch, except for the jewel bearings and the mainspring (produced by Jieyang Clock and Watch Factory), are made by themselves. And the machines that make these parts are created by themselves.

Is this a myth? No, this is a fact, one of the miracles created by hundreds of millions of working people. The creator of this miracle is Liu Haiyue, a forty-nine-year-old ordinary worker who only attended school for one year.

Dreaming of Reaching the Sky

Liu Haiyue is the son of a carpenter. He followed his father as a carpenter at the age of fourteen, but when he was eighteen, he was attracted to watch repair. He tightened his belt and scrimped and saved fifty silver dollars for apprenticeship fees to learn watch repair. It has been thirty-one years now. But the idea of making watches only came after liberation.

At the end of 1952, Liu Haiyue heard that the country was going to carry out industrialization, and he was very happy. He thought, "I must also make something to fulfill my responsibility and express my heart." But what to make? He thought: I have been repairing watches for more than twenty years, and none of them are made in China. Okay, I will make a Chinese-made watch.

That night, Liu Haiyue did not sleep all night. He excitedly considered how to start realizing his plan.

The news spread to the colleagues around him, and people were shocked. Kind-hearted people said, "Liu Haiyue, aren't you dreaming of reaching the sky?"

He replied, "Difficulties, no matter how great, can be overcome slowly. Foreigners have them, why can't we have them?"

Research began. He repaired watches as usual during the day, and at night he carefully studied watches. One year, two years passed, and many principles were understood. So, he thought: As long as there are parts, I can fit them together; broken parts can be modified; a two-hand watch can be turned into a three-hand watch by adding a few parts, a non-magnetic watch can be made anti-magnetic... But only fitting parts is fitting watches, not making watches. To make watches, you must first make parts, and to make parts, you must have machines. But Liu Haiyue had only seen watches in his life, and he had never even seen the machines for making watches.

At this time, Liu Haiyue was still working individually. In order to ensure a normal income to support his family, he had to continue to devote his main energy to watch repair. Although Liu Haiyue wanted to "reach the sky," he could not fly.

Taking Flight

The Party led the masses to organize cooperatives, which gave Liu Haiyue wings, and he took flight. Since joining the Clock and Watch Cooperative in 1955, at the suggestion of the director and with the unanimous agreement of the members, it was decided that Liu Haiyue would not participate in production and would concentrate on research work. Everyone said: We should have Chinese-made watches. We will deduct a little money from our wages for Liu Haiyue, and since he has high skills, he should get the highest wage. The cooperative will pay for all the tools he needs to set up.

Liu Haiyue was so moved that he didn't know what to do. He studied tirelessly, sometimes jumping up suddenly in the middle of the night to add a part to his symbolic set of machines on the table.

Determination finally overcame difficulties, secrets were revealed layer by layer, and Liu Haiyue began to make machine tools. In principle, there should be lathes, drilling machines, milling machines..., but he didn't even have decent tools, let alone those. He thought: It can be done without them, otherwise how did the world's first lathe come about? Without a drilling machine, he remembered the bow drill he used to use as a carpenter, and used it instead of a drilling machine. Although he was sweating all over, it worked! Without a lathe, he used a file, but filing was uneven and laborious, so he remembered the carpenter's plane. So he fixed the file and added some wood to the object to be processed, planing it like planing wood. Without a milling machine to make gear wheels, he simply dismantled the clock at home and used the gear wheels inside as parts for the machine tool. The lathe was initially made. At first, the lathe and milling machine were separate. After the parts were turned, they were disassembled and put on the milling machine. But the parts were too small, and it was difficult and inaccurate to reattach them to the milling machine. He also worked out a way to combine the lathe and milling machine.

But, to drill a hole in the middle of a shaft as thin as a sewing needle, and to mill eight gear teeth on its head, that's where the problem came in. It broke as soon as he drilled it. After working for two days, he still hadn't drilled a single shaft hole. On the third day, he drilled a hole, but it was not straight. And how could the naked eye distinguish the difference that could not exceed the thickness of a hair? Difficulties were like an invisible but strong rope, tightly holding his head.

But determination can break through all mountains. Liu Haiyue finally came up with a solution: change the speed and use automatic feed, so that the feed is not too fast and uniform, so that the parts and the cutting tool will not break. As for the problem of inaccuracy, he came up with a fixed cutting tool that automatically stopped when the part was processed to meet the standard. If Liu Haiyue was a mechanical worker, the problem might be easier to solve, but he had never even touched a lathe! So, the problem of automatic feed alone took him more than two months to figure out. Is there anything more difficult than having to learn everything from scratch?

Difficulties were overcome one by one. Every time a difficulty was overcome, his machine tool was improved once, and finally he made a semi-automatic comprehensive machine tool. This machine tool, which is not even half a newspaper in size, has more than 1,300 parts. It includes various equipment such as turning, milling, and drilling, and can process ten parts at the same time. Relying on this machine tool, at the end of 1957, he made the first twenty-one jewel, large three-hand, water-resistant, shock-resistant, and anti-magnetic watch.

"Week Watch"

Liu Haiyue was not satisfied with this. He wanted to make three kinds of watches. Now he has only made one. The automatic watch and the "week watch" have not yet been made! In the first ten months of 1959, he made another automatic universal machine tool. With this machine tool, he made an alarm clock the size of a teacup that could run for a week.

But his spirit was concentrated on the "week watch." In principle, perhaps it could be done simply by making the mainspring seven times longer, but then the watch would be very large and ugly. After several months of research, he finally came up with a clever solution. After calculating, this could run accurately for a week. The parts were made one by one, but where could he find a mainspring that could run for a week?

At this time, employees from Jieyang Clock and Watch Factory came to visit and learn. They asked him, "Comrade Liu, what do you need us to do?" "I hope for such a mainspring, can you help?" "Easy." This was really meeting good helpers. Experts know that the mainspring of Jieyang Clock and Watch Factory is really the best in the country. They specially designed and manufactured it for him. Before long, a batch of specially made mainsprings was delivered.

Originally, a watch is a very precise thing. Now, changing from running for one day to running for seven days makes the entire structure different. Although the principle was understood, the installation problem alone was a big problem. He failed once, failed twice, and later couldn't remember how many times he failed.

The Party and the people gave him honor. Liu Haiyue attended the advanced producer meetings of the county, prefecture, and province time and time again. All this made Liu Haiyue determined to muster greater energy and continue to move forward. Now the secret of the automatic watch has also been revealed. He said with confidence: "In 1960, we will produce three types of watches: one-day watch, week watch, and automatic watch, and it will not be produced by one person." Someone asked him: "Uncle Yue, the watch is made, but is the quality good?" He smiled easily and said: "What is the standard of good? Isn't it accurate, durable, and beautiful? We are confident in accuracy; durability is not a problem, we can stand the test of time; we are a little lacking in aesthetics, and there are other shortcomings. But don't be afraid, we can catch up!" Yes, since we only took a few years to complete the road that others have walked for who knows how long, what else are you worried about?

    刘海岳巧创“星期表”
    柯炳藩
    在广东梅县丙村公社，有一间设备非常简陋的钟表厂，全厂只有二十六人，除了一些简单的修理工具和几个台钳之外，可以说什么也没有。可是就在这样的工厂里，生产了一种恐怕就是内行也没有听说过的“星期表”。这种表上一次链就能走七天；有大三针，二十一石，能避水、避震、避磁，至于他的准确程度，走了一个月只差半分钟。表的全部零件，除了玻璃石和发条（揭阳钟表厂出产）之外，都是自己制造的。而制造这些零件的又是他们自己创造的机器。
    这是神话么？不是，这是事实，是千百万劳动人民创造的奇迹中的一个。创造这个奇迹的是四十九岁的刘海岳，一个只念过一年书的普通工人。
    想上天
    刘海岳是一个木匠的儿子。十四岁就跟着父亲做木工，但是当他十八岁那一年，却给修钟表吸引住了。他勒紧裤带、饿肚皮凑足五十大洋拜师费去学修表。到现在已经有三十一年了。可是关于做表的念头，却是解放后才有的。
    1952年年底，刘海岳听说国家要搞工业化，他真高兴，心里想：“我也一定要搞出一件东西，尽责任，表心意。”可是搞什么呢？他想：我修了二十多年的手表，就没有一个是中国做的。好吧，我做一个中国造的手表。
    那一夜，刘海岳一夜没睡，他兴奋地考虑着如何开始实现自己的计划。
    消息给周围的同行人知道了，人们震惊了。好心的人说道：“刘海岳，你这不是想上天啊？”
    他回答道：“天大的困难慢慢克服，外国人都有了，我们为什么不能有。”
    研究开始了，他白天照常修表，夜里就对手表细心研究。一年、二年过去了，很多道理给弄通了，于是，他想：只要有零件，我就能把它配上来；坏的零件可以改过；二针的表，我加上几个零件就能把它变三针，不避磁的表能变避磁……。只是，只会把零件配上来，那是配表，不是做表。要做表，就得先做零件，要做零件就得有机器，可是刘海岳一生只看过表，至于做表的机器，连看都没看过。
    这时候，刘海岳还是单干，为了正常收入以保证一家的生活，他不得不仍然以主要的精力去修表。刘海岳虽然想“上天”，却怎么也飞不起来。
    飞起来了
    党领导群众组织合作社，这就给刘海岳插上了翅膀，他飞起来了。自从1955年参加钟表合作社后，在社长提议、社员讨论并一致同意的情况下，决定刘海岳不用参加生产，集中精力搞研究工作。大家都说：我们应该有中国造的表。在我们的工资里抽给刘海岳一点钱，而且他技术高，应该得最高的工资。他要设置工具，也全部由社里给钱。
    刘海岳感动得不知如何是好。他一刻也不松懈地钻研，有时睡到半夜，还突然一跃而起，给自己排在桌子上那一套象征性的机器添一个零件。
    决心终于战胜了困难，秘密一层层被揭开，刘海岳开始做机床了。按照道理，这应该有车床、钻床、铣床……，可是他连像样点的工具都没有，更不要说这些了。他想：没有也能做，不然世界上第一部车床又怎样来的呢？没有钻床，他想起当年做木工的拉弓钻，就用它代替钻床，虽然累得满身大汗，但到底也成啊！没有车床，就用锉，可是锉又锉不平，又费力，他又想起木工的刨子，于是就把锉子固定下来，把要加工的东西上面加点木头，就像刨木头那样刨着。没有铣床可以做牙轮，他索性把家里的挂钟拆掉，用里面的牙轮做机床的零件。车床初步做成了。最初车床和铣床是分开的，零件车完了，就拆到铣床上去。可是零件太细了，要重新安上铣床，既困难又不准确。他又研究出车床和铣床合在一起的办法。
    可是，要在像绣花针那么细的车心中间钻通一个孔，还要在它头上铣上八个轮牙，这一来，问题就来了。一钻就断，搞了两天还没钻好一个车心孔，第三天钻了一个孔，却又不正。而且用肉眼怎么能分得清不能超过比头发还细很多的差别呢？困难像一根无形而又坚韧的绳索，牢牢地箍住了他的脑袋。
    可是，决心能冲破万重山，刘海岳终于想出：改变速度和采用自动进刀的办法，使进刀不太快而又均匀，这样零件和车刀就不会断了。至于不准确的问题，就来一个固定车刀，零件加工到符合标准的时候，就自动地停下来。假如刘海岳是一个机械工人，那问题也许会好解决一些，可是他连车床都没摸过呢！于是单是一个自动进刀的问题，就整整地想了两个多月。还有什么比一切都得从头学起做起还难的么？
    困难一个个都给克服了。每克服一个困难，他的机床就改进一次，终于做成一部半自动化的综合机床。这一部还没有半张报纸大的机床，有一千三百多个零件，它包括了车、铣、钻等各种设备，能同时加工成十件零件。就依靠这部机床，1957年底制成第一个二十一石、大三针、能避水、避震、避磁的手表。
    “星期表”
    刘海岳并不就此满足，他要做三种表，现在只有一种，自动表和“星期表”还没有做成呢！就在1959年的头十个月，他又制成一台自动的万能机床。用这部机床，他制成一个茶杯大、能走一星期的闹钟。
    可是他的精神却集中在“星期表”上，照道理，也许只要发条长七倍就成了，可是这一来表就大得非常难看了。经过几个月的钻研，他终于想到一个巧妙的办法，算了一下，这就能准确地跑一星期。零件一件件做出来了，可是能走一星期的发条哪里有啊？
    这时，揭阳钟表厂的职工前来参观、学习。问他说：“刘同志，你需要我们做些什么吗？”“我希望这样的发条，能帮忙么？”“好办。”这真是碰上了好帮手啊，内行人都知道，揭阳钟表厂的发条，可真是全国第一流的。他们专门给他设计制造，没有多久，一打专造的发条就送来了。
    本来，手表是很精密的东西，现在从走一天要改为走七天，于是整个结构就不同了。虽然道理是通了，可是单是一个安装问题，就是一个大问题，他装了一次失败了，二次失败了，后来也记不清失败多少次了。
    党和人民给他以荣誉，刘海岳一次又一次地出席了县、专区、全省的先进生产者会议，这一切使刘海岳下定决心鼓起更大的干劲继续前进。现在自动表的秘密也已揭开了，他满怀信心地说：“1960年我们一日表，星期表，自动表三样都要生产，而且不是一个人生产。”有人问过他：“岳伯，表是做成了，可是质量好么？”他轻松地笑着说：“你说，好的标准是什么？不是准确、耐用和美观么？准确我们是有把握的；耐用也没问题，我们经得起时间考验；美观我们差点，其他缺点也还有。可是不怕，我们能赶上去！”是啊，既然我们只用不上几年就走完人家走了不知多少年的道路，你还担心什么呢？
