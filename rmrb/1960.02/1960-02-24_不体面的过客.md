An unseemly passerby
Zhai Ji

Eisenhower put on a smiling face to go to Latin America. But in the radio speech he delivered on the eve of his departure, there was still a surge of anger. He said: "We detest the spreading of lies and distortions in international relations." For example, recently a "distant country" used "excited language" to say that "the United States maintains colonialist relations with Latin America." He couldn't help but yell: "This is nonsense."

It turns out that the anger came from the "distant country," and it couldn't help but erupt, showing that the "excited language" really stung the president.

However, as soon as Eisenhower got off the plane in Puerto Rico, he was met by demonstrators holding signs with slogans like: "The United States is oppression!" "Let us get rid of colonialism!" "Don't forget the promise you made about independence!"

These were more than just "excited language." But this did not come from a "distant country," but from Puerto Rico, the "outstanding example of development in cooperation with the United States" and a "commonwealth within the American system" that the president boasted about. This was obviously not due to someone spreading lies and distortions.

However, according to the United Press International, Eisenhower did not express "detestation," but was "smiling and relaxed, and he seemed unaware of the demonstration." Perhaps this was to maintain the "decent record" of the United States in dealing with other countries.

But the United States' record in Puerto Rico is not so decent. From 1898, the United States militarily occupied Puerto Rico for more than fifty years. It was not until 1952 that Puerto Rico was granted the status of a "free commonwealth." However, this "free commonwealth" is not free; internal affairs, diplomacy, military affairs, and economic lifelines are all in the hands of the United States. The United States Congress, the President, and the Supreme Court have the power to veto the corresponding institutions in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico must implement American federal laws; but Puerto Rico does not have a seat in the United States Congress, and the Puerto Rican legislature has no power to pass laws that conflict with American laws. Puerto Ricans call this system a "ridiculous puppet." Now, the United States has established twenty-one naval and air force bases on this small island nation, with 30,000 troops stationed there. On average, there is one American soldier for every hundred local residents. One-third of Puerto Rico's territory is currently designated by the United States for military use. Puerto Ricans must also serve in the American military. In other words, in reality, Puerto Rico is still a colony of the United States to this day. They have shed countless blood to overthrow this puppet. The 1950 uprising in Puerto Rico was suppressed by American tanks and artillery. The status the United States is now preparing for Puerto Rico is to become the 51st state of the United States. Eisenhower was not ashamed to say before going abroad that "it is absurd to accuse us (the United States) of placing or wanting to place any country in a colonial position." This kind of lie is utterly absurd.

Now, the "bottom line" of the United States' colonialist relations with Latin America has been exposed not by a "distant country" but by the people of Puerto Rico, where Eisenhower spent the night. Fortunately, the American president spent the night at an American air force base in Puerto Rico, but I'm afraid he also had a restless night.

    不体面的过客

    艾森豪威尔装出了一付笑脸到拉丁美洲去。但他在动身前夕发表的广播演说中，却还有一股怒气。他说：“我们痛恨在国际关系中散布谎言和进行歪曲”。例子是，最近有一个“遥远的国家”用一种“激动的语言”说，“美国对拉丁美洲保持殖民主义关系”。他不禁大骂说：“这是胡说八道”。
    原来，怒气出在“遥远的国家”身上，而且，不禁发作起来，可见“激动的语言”着实刺痛了总统。
    可是，偏偏艾森豪威尔在波多黎各一下飞机，迎面扑来的是示威群众高举的标语牌，上面竟写着：“美国就是压迫！”“让我们摆脱殖民主义！”“不要忘记你作出的关于独立的诺言！”
    这些，何止是“激动的语言”而已。不过这却不是来自“遥远的国家”，而是来自总统夸耀的“在同美国的合作下发展的卓越的榜样”的“在美国制度以内的一个联邦”——波多黎各。这显然不是由于有人散布了谎言和进行了歪曲的原故。
    但是，据合众国际社报道，艾森豪威尔并没有表示“痛恨”，却是“面带笑容、精神轻松，他显得不知道有示威的事”。这也许是为了要保持美国在同其他国家打交道方面的“体面的纪录”吧。
    不过美国在波多黎各的纪录却不是那末体面的。从1898年开始，美国武装占领波多黎各五十多年。直到1952年才算给了波多黎各“自由联邦”的地位。但，这个“自由联邦”并不自由，内政、外交、军事和经济命脉，全都掌握在美国手中。美国国会、总统和最高法院对波多黎各相应机构有否决权力，波多黎各要实行美国的联邦法律；而波多黎各在美国国会中却没有一个议员席位，波多黎各的立法机关无权通过与美国法律相抵触的法律。波多黎各人把这个制度称为“荒唐可笑的木偶。”现在，美国在这个小小的岛国上设立了二十一个海军和空军基地，驻有三万军队。平均当地每一百个居民中就有一个美国兵。波多黎各三分之一的领土目前被美国划作军用。波多黎各人还必须服美国兵役。也就是说，实际上，波多黎各一直到现在还是美国的殖民地。他们为了推翻这个木偶，不知流了多少血。1950年波多黎各爆发的起义，就是被美国的坦克和大炮镇压下去的。美国现在给波多黎各准备的地位是成为美国的第五十一州。艾森豪威尔出国前竟毫不脸红地说什么“指责我们（美国）使或者希望使任何国家处于殖民地地位是荒谬的。”这种谎话才是十分荒谬的。
    现在，美国对拉丁美洲保持殖民主义关系的“底”不是被“遥远的国家”而是被艾森豪威尔夜宿其境的波多黎各的人民当面揭穿了。幸亏这位美国总统是在设于波多黎各的美国空军基地过夜的，不过恐怕也是一夜难安吧。
