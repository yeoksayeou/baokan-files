Long Live the People's Commune
--Preface to the Book "The People's Commune is Good"
Wang Enmao, First Secretary of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee of the CPC

"The People's Commune is Good" – the book of investigation on the People's Commune in Xinjiang reflects the victory of the People's Commune movement with great historical significance achieved by the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao.

It has been a year since the People's Communes were established in the vast rural and pastoral areas of northern and southern Tianshan Mountains in the autumn of 1958. In this short year, all 451 People's Communes in the region have developed in production and capital construction, increased income, and improved the lives of their members. After a series of rectification work, the People's Communes have embarked on the road of consolidation and development, and are increasingly showing their powerful vitality and unparalleled superiority.

The victory of the People's Commune movement in the Autonomous Region in the autumn of 1958 was by no means accidental. If the victory of the agricultural cooperativization movement was the inevitable result of the victory of the land reform, then the victory of the People's Commune movement was the inevitable result of the victorious development of the agricultural cooperativization movement. The Autonomous Region basically completed the land reform in the winter of 1953, completed the elementary agricultural cooperativization in the spring of 1956, realized the advanced agricultural cooperativization in 1957, and achieved the great victory of the struggle between the two roads in the rural areas from the winter of 1957 to the spring of 1958. In 1958, the Party put forward the general line of socialist construction, which promoted the great leap forward in production. In the great leap forward in production, the masses felt that the scale of the original agricultural cooperatives could not meet the needs of production development, and they demanded to unite and turn into large cooperatives. Some areas automatically broke the boundaries of cooperatives, townships, and even districts to carry out large-scale socialist collaboration; some areas implemented the collectivization of life according to the needs of production development and the demands of the masses. All these prepared the conditions for the People's Commune. Therefore, once the call of the Party and Chairman Mao on establishing People's Communes was issued, the People's Commune movement in the entire Autonomous Region developed like a prairie fire, unstoppable. At the same time, because the People's Commune showed unparalleled superiority from the beginning, it immediately received the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of people, and stood as firm as the Tianshan Mountains. This powerfully proves that the People's Commune movement is the urgent demand of the farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region, and is completely in line with the laws of historical development. Some people who shout "People's Communes were established too early" have no basis at all.

Because the People's Commune has a large organizational scale and can uniformly allocate and use labor, animal power, and production tools on a larger scale, rationally use land, and develop diversified operations, it not only powerfully guaranteed the victory of the "Three Autumns" production and the great steelmaking campaign when it was first established in the autumn of 1958, but also promoted the continued leap forward in agricultural and animal husbandry production and the overall development of other aspects of production in 1959. On the basis of great development in production, the cultural, educational, and health undertakings in rural and pastoral areas have also achieved brilliant results, and the material and cultural life of the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen has been further improved. Some people say: "The People's Commune is badly run," but the facts and the people answer: The People's Commune is not badly run, but well run!

The People's Commune implements the distribution system according to labor, which combines the wage system and the supply system, which is in line with the current economic level of the People's Commune and the needs of developing production, and is therefore warmly supported by the broad masses of people. This system, on the one hand, solves the living difficulties that could not be solved by members with less labor and more population in the advanced agricultural cooperatives, and on the other hand, it is also beneficial to members with more labor and less population; on the one hand, it takes care of everyone's life, and on the other hand, it also pays attention to personal interests; on the one hand, it implements putting politics in command, and on the other hand, it also pays attention to material encouragement. Some people oppose this system, saying that "lazy people will emerge under the supply system." What are the facts? The implementation of this system not only did not produce lazy people, but on the contrary, mobilized the production enthusiasm of all members, and thus promoted the leap-forward development of various production in rural and pastoral areas.

With the establishment of the People's Commune, public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and other collective welfare undertakings have developed rapidly, and have been consolidated and improved. Over the past year, these collective welfare undertakings have fully exerted their superiority in liberating women, liberating rural and pastoral labor, saving food, and improving people's lives, and have powerfully promoted the development of commune production and the strengthening of the collective spirit of the members. We must adhere to these collective welfare undertakings and run them better.

Because the People's Commune has organized production cooperation on a larger scale and realized collectivization in life, the socialist unity and cooperation among the people of all ethnic groups has been further enhanced, which is of great significance in the multi-ethnic Xinjiang region. It can be expected that, due to the closer cooperation and contact among the people of all ethnic groups in production and life within the commune, the process of their close unity and even integration will be greatly accelerated, which will have an inestimable and far-reaching impact on the development of Xinjiang's socialist and communist construction.

At present, although the People's Commune still takes the ownership of the production brigade, which is equivalent to the original advanced cooperative, as the basic ownership, it is very different from the advanced cooperative: the advanced cooperative is a small collective, and the People's Commune is a much larger collective; the advanced cooperative only operates agriculture, while the People's Commune operates a variety of economic undertakings; the advanced cooperative is only an economic organization, while the People's Commune is a unified organization of politics, economy, and culture; the advanced cooperative is only the organizer of collective production, while the People's Commune is also the organizer of collective life. What is particularly important is that the advanced cooperative only has the small collective economy of the agricultural cooperative, while the People's Commune also has a part of the commune-owned economy. Although the current commune-run enterprises, commune-run undertakings, and the accumulation fund and public welfare fund controlled by the commune are not very large, they represent the infinitely bright future of rural China. That is to say, the commune can extract accumulation from the production team every year, increase accumulation from the profits of commune-run enterprises, plus national investment, and the commune ownership will gradually develop into the basic ownership. With the development of production and the commune ownership becoming the basic ownership, the components of ownership by the whole people will also gradually increase. The People's Commune will undoubtedly accelerate the transition from socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people. In addition, although the People's Commune is still socialist in nature, it already contains some communist sprouts. The People's Commune is not only a good organizational form for accelerating socialist construction, but also a good organizational form for the future transition from socialism to communism. After a year of practice in the People's Commune, we have deepened our understanding of this issue.

Because the People's Commune system powerfully promotes the great leap forward in socialist construction and greatly strengthens the economic and political advantages of socialism in rural and pastoral areas, it will make the foundation of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois private ownership be eliminated more quickly and thoroughly, and make all attempts at capitalist restoration be completely shattered. Therefore, the People's Commune, on the one hand, has gained the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of people, and on the other hand, has also been opposed and attacked by people representing capitalist forces and a small number of wealthy middle peasants, making the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism develop to a new stage. The People's Commune is a new thing that conforms to the laws of historical development. This kind of new thing is bound to win, and any attempt to oppose and prevent its victory is impossible to realize. Socialism must defeat capitalism, the People's Commune must win, and socialism and communism must win.

Of course, because the People's Commune is a new social organization that was produced in the great leap forward situation in our country, and it has not been established for a long time, we still lack experience. Therefore, in the initial stage of its establishment, we inevitably encountered some difficulties and produced some shortcomings. However, it must be understood that these are difficulties and shortcomings in the process of progress, which can be overcome, and have been quickly overcome. We must regard running the People's Commune well as the central task of the Party, strengthen the leadership and work of the People's Commune, and make it more consolidated, developed, and stronger. We firmly believe that, under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao and the enthusiastic support of the people of all ethnic groups, the People's Commune will surely develop victoriously and shine brightly!

    人民公社万岁
    ——“人民公社好”一书的序言
    中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会第一书记　王恩茂
    “人民公社好”——新疆人民公社调查一书，反映了新疆各族人民在党和毛主席的领导下，取得的具有伟大历史意义的人民公社化运动的胜利。
    自从1958年秋季人民公社在天山南北广大农村、牧区建立以来，已经一年了。在这短短的一年中，全区四百五十一个人民公社，生产和基本建设都有发展，收入都有增加，社员生活都有改善；经过一系列的整顿工作，人民公社都已走上巩固和发展的道路，并且日益显示出强大的生命力和无比的优越性。
    自治区人民公社化运动，所以能在1958年秋季迅速地取得胜利，绝不是偶然的。如果说农业合作化运动的胜利，是土地改革胜利发展的必然结果，那么人民公社化运动的胜利，就是农业合作化运动胜利发展的必然结果。自治区1953年冬基本上完成了土地改革，1956年春完成了农业初级合作化，1957年实现了农业高级合作化，1957年冬至1958年春取得了农村两条道路斗争的伟大胜利。1958年党提出了社会主义建设总路线，促进了生产大跃进，在生产大跃进中，群众感到原来农业合作社的规模不能适应生产发展的需要，而纷纷要求联合起来并转大社，有些地区自动打破社界、乡界以至区界，进行了大规模的社会主义大协作；有的地区根据生产发展的需要和群众的要求，实行了生活集体化。这些都为人民公社化准备了条件。因此，当党和毛主席关于建立人民公社的号召一经发出，全自治区的人民公社化运动，就如烈火燎原，势不可当地发展起来。同时，由于人民公社一开始就显示出了无比的优越性，因此立即得到广大群众的热烈拥护和支持，并像天山一样，屹立不倒。这就有力地证明了：人民公社化运动是自治区各族农牧民的迫切要求，是完全合乎历史发展规律的。有些人叫喊“人民公社化搞早了”是完全没有根据的。
    由于人民公社组织规模大，能在更大范围内统一调配使用劳力、畜力、生产工具，合理使用土地，开展多种经营，因而不仅在1958年秋天刚刚建立时就有力地保证了“三秋”生产和大炼钢铁的胜利，而且促进了1959年农牧业生产的继续跃进和其它各方面生产的全面发展；在生产大发展的基础上，农牧区的文教卫生事业也获得了辉煌的成绩，广大农牧区人民群众的物质文化生活得到了进一步的改善。有的人说：“人民公社办糟了”，而事实和人民群众回答说：人民公社不是办糟了，而是办好了！
    人民公社实行工资制和供给制相结合的按劳分配制度，是符合人民公社当前经济水平和发展生产的需要的，因而受到广大群众的热烈拥护。这种制度，一方面解决了劳力少、人口多的社员在高级农业社时所不能解决的生活困难，另一方面也有利于劳力多、人口少的社员；一方面照顾了大家的生活，另一方面也注意了个人利益；一方面实行了政治挂帅，另一方面也注意了物质鼓励。有些人反对这一制度，说什么“供给制下出懒汉”，事实怎样呢？实行这一制度不仅没有出懒汉，相反地却调动了全体社员的生产积极性，并因此促进了农牧区的各种生产的飞跃发展。
    随着人民公社的建立，公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等等集体福利事业迅速地发展起来了，并得到了巩固和提高。一年来这些集体福利事业已充分发挥了它解放妇女、解放农牧区劳动力、节约粮食、改善人民生活等等方面的优越性，有力地促进了公社生产的发展和社员集体主义思想的加强。我们一定要坚持这些集体福利事业，并把它办得更好。
    由于人民公社在更大范围内组织了生产协作，在生活上实现了集体化，各族人民之间的社会主义团结合作更进一步地增强了，这在多民族的新疆地区具有十分重要的意义。可以预期，由于在公社范围内各族人民在生产与生活上更密切的合作和接触，他们之间的亲密团结以至融为一体的过程将大大加速，这对新疆的社会主义和共产主义建设事业的发展，将产生不可估量的深远影响。
    目前，人民公社虽然仍然以相当于原来高级社的生产大队的所有制为基本的所有制，但是，它比起高级社来，却有很大的区别：高级社是小集体，人民公社是大得多的集体；高级社只经营农业，人民公社却经营着多种经济事业；高级社只是经济组织，人民公社是政治、经济和文化的统一组织；高级社只是集体生产的组织者，人民公社同时又是集体生活的组织者。特别重要的是，高级社只有农业社的小集体经济，而人民公社却同时有了部分的公社所有制经济。虽然人民公社现在的社办企业、社办事业以及由公社支配的公积金、公益金等还不很多，但是，它却代表着我国农村无限光明的前途。这就是说，公社每年可以由生产队提取积累，由社办企业利润增加积累，加上国家的投资，公社所有制就会逐渐地发展成为基本的所有制。随着生产的发展和公社所有制成为基本的所有制，全民所有制的成分也将逐步增长。人民公社无疑将加速实现社会主义集体所有制过渡到社会主义全民所有制。另外，人民公社目前虽然还是社会主义性质的，但是，它已经含有若干共产主义萌芽，人民公社不仅是加速社会主义建设的良好组织形式，而且也是将来由社会主义向共产主义过渡的良好组织形式。经过人民公社一年的实践，加深了我们对于这一问题的认识。
    由于人民公社制度有力地推动了社会主义建设的大跃进，大大加强了社会主义在农牧区的经济、政治优势，这就使资产阶级和小资产阶级私有制的根基将更快地彻底地消灭，使一切资本主义复辟的企图遭到彻底的粉碎。所以，人民公社一方面获得了广大群众的热烈拥护和支持，另一方面也遭到了代表资本主义势力的人们和一小部分富裕中农的反对和攻击，使社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争发展到一个新的阶段。人民公社是符合历史发展规律的新生事物，这种新生事物，是必然要胜利的，任何要反对和阻止它的胜利的企图都是不可能实现的。社会主义一定要战胜资本主义，人民公社一定要胜利，社会主义和共产主义一定要胜利。
    当然，由于人民公社是在我国大跃进形势下产生的新的社会组织，又加诞生的时间不长，我们还缺乏经验，因之在建立初期，不可避免地遇到了一些困难，产生了一些缺点。但是，必须了解，这些是前进中的困难和缺点，是能够克服的，并且已经很快地克服了。我们必须把办好人民公社当作党的中心任务，加强对人民公社的领导和工作，使它更加巩固、发展和壮大。我们坚信，人民公社在党和毛主席的正确领导和各族人民的热烈拥护下，必将胜利发展，光芒万丈！
