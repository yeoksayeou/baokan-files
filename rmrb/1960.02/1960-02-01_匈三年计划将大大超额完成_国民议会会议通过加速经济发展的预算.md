Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, January 31st. The Hungarian National Assembly meeting, which opened on January 28th, closed in Budapest on the afternoon of the 30th.

    Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and government leaders Kádár, Münnich, and others attended the meeting.

    The meeting unanimously elected Marosan as a member of the Presidium of the People's Republic.

    The meeting approved the Hungarian state budget for 1960. The meeting also unanimously adopted a resolution supporting the appeal of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to the parliaments and governments of all countries on the issue of disarmament.

    The 1960 Hungarian state budget, adopted by the meeting on the 29th, stipulates that Hungary's budget revenue this year will be 67.713 billion forints (Hungarian currency), and expenditure will be 67.4 billion forints. Of the total budget expenditure, allocations for the development of the national economy account for 58.3%, and allocations for social and cultural needs account for 28.8%.

    At the morning session on January 28th, Finance Minister Nyers gave a report to the meeting on the 1960 state budget. He spoke about Hungary's completion of the main targets of the Three-Year Plan (1958-1960) a year ahead of schedule, and the execution of the state budget last year. He pointed out that the state budget for 1959 was balanced in terms of revenue and expenditure.

    The reporter pointed out that the 1960 budget was formulated in the spirit of accelerating the development of the national economy and laying a good foundation for the second Five-Year Plan (1961-1965). Achieving this year's plan targets will mean greatly overfulfilling the Three-Year Plan. It is expected that national income will increase by 12% compared to the 1960 level in the original Three-Year Plan, socialist industrial production will increase by 10%, labor productivity will increase by 3.1%, and agricultural production will increase by 2%. Investment and the real wages of workers will also greatly exceed the targets of the Five-Year Plan.

    In 1960, funds will continue to be used centrally, mainly for completing existing capital construction, expanding existing enterprises, and updating equipment. This year, the construction of the electricity and metallurgy sectors will be accelerated, and the production of electricity and steel will be greatly increased.

    The total agricultural investment in 1960 will reach 7 billion forints, primarily to meet the needs for agricultural machinery. With the development of the agricultural collectivization movement, the state will continue to vigorously support cooperatives this year, providing them with long-term loans of up to 2.2 billion forints.

    Expenditure on health, social welfare, and culture will reach 19.4 billion forints, and expenditure for defense purposes will be 3.1 billion forints.

    The reporter concluded by saying that this year's budget plan is a realistic plan formulated on the basis of the production achievements already made. The labor competition, which is being launched across the country to welcome the 15th anniversary of the liberation of the motherland, will ensure a more rapid development of the national economy.

    On the morning of the 29th, Politburo member of the Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party and First Deputy Prime Minister of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, Apró, spoke during the discussion of the budget. Apró said that the working enthusiasm of the Hungarian working people is currently very high, the international situation is also favorable to us, and the selfless, fraternal cooperation of the countries of the socialist camp is becoming increasingly close. Hungary has the possibility of realizing as soon as possible the goals put forward by the Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party of ending the socialist foundation work in Hungary and accelerating socialist construction.

    Apró pointed out that the Hungarian Three-Year Plan (1958-1960) for developing the national economy stipulates that national income should increase by 13%. If this year's targets are successfully completed, then by the end of the year it will increase by 25% compared to 1957. Industrial production was originally planned to increase by 22% in three years, but completing this year's plan will increase it by 35%; agricultural production was originally planned to increase by 12% in three years, but by the end of this year it will increase by 14% to 16%. Labor productivity in the industrial sector was originally planned to increase by 15% in three years, but by the end of this year it will increase by 19%.

    Apró said that with the development of industrial production, the proportion of national income used for accumulation will increase from 22% in 1959 to 25% this year. He pointed out that Hungary's investment in capital construction this year is larger than in any other year. The agricultural investment this year will increase by 27% compared to last year, and half of the investment will be used to develop agricultural mechanization.

    Apró pointed out that Hungary's socialist transformation of agriculture has achieved great success. At the beginning of the Three-Year Plan, the area of cultivated land with socialist components only accounted for one-quarter of the country's total cultivated land area, but now it accounts for 66.2%. Since November 1st last year, the number of members of agricultural production cooperatives has increased by 293,000, and the number of completely collectivized villages and towns has increased by 767.

    Apró concluded by saying that we must constantly improve economic leadership, expand the powers of the leaders of various enterprises, and give play to their creativity. Every economic leader should strengthen study, earnestly implement the party's policies, and launch a resolute struggle against various shortcomings and irresponsible attitudes.

    The meeting also heard the work summary report of the Hungarian Supreme Court for the past two years by Jahul Bakos Mihály, President of the Hungarian Supreme Court, and heard a report on the visit of the Hungarian National Assembly delegation to Czechoslovakia.
