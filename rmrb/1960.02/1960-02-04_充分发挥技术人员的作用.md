    Give Full Play to the Role of Technical Personnel
    Jin Gong
    Currently, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in many factories and enterprises is developing from low to high, from simple to complex, and from sporadic technical reforms to a series of technical transformation movements of mechanization, semi-mechanization, and automation, semi-automation. A large number of factory and enterprise workers are breaking into the "forbidden zone" of science and beginning to climb the peaks of advanced, precision, and cutting-edge technology. Under this new situation, we are faced with a series of more complex and arduous technical problems. Therefore, while mobilizing workers to continue to fiercely attack technical difficulties, it is even more important to further mobilize technical personnel to participate in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. In the continuous Great Leap Forward of 1958 and 1959, technical personnel received profound education in the "three combinations," which not only significantly improved their technical skills but also greatly advanced their political ideology. At the same time, during the Great Leap Forward, a group of veteran workers with rich practical experience in production joined the technical ranks. All of these provide unprecedentedly favorable conditions for mobilizing the enthusiasm of technical personnel.
    The most effective way to further mobilize technical personnel to participate in technical innovation and technical revolution is to attract the vast number of technical personnel to participate in the vigorous mass movement. In the torrent of the mass movement, in the struggle of production practice, technical personnel are tempered, reformed, and improved. Technical innovation and technical revolution not only transform technology but also transform people's thinking and skills. In the process of technical innovation and technical revolution, it is necessary to break the old conventions that bind the growth of new things and fight against all ideas of following the old ways, sticking to conventions, and following a set routine. Many technical personnel who have been deeply influenced by bourgeois education participate in the movement, leave the laboratory, frequently go to the masses and to the reality of production, which may enable them to believe in the power and wisdom of the masses, further understand the reality of production and change their thoughts and feelings. The facts of the Tianjin Tractor Factory are a vivid example. Before the Great Leap Forward, many technical personnel in this factory had a more serious phenomenon of being divorced from the masses and divorced from reality. When designing tractors, some technical personnel believed that design work was a matter for professionals and that mass movements could not be carried out; some even advocated establishing a "closed" design department, forming a system from design, trial production to testing, strictly isolating themselves from workers and production. Obviously, if this method were followed, it would inevitably be cold and sluggish, causing the design of the tractor to be slow in coming to fruition. The Party Committee of this factory adopted another method: organizing all the technical personnel of the factory to participate in the mass movement, inserting red flags, establishing pacesetters, and organizing competitions. As a result, the technical innovation movement throughout the factory developed vigorously and rapidly. In the past year alone, more than 300 major technical innovations were realized, and the design, trial production, and production of tractors were completed quickly and well. The political consciousness of the technical personnel has been improved, and the technical theoretical knowledge has been tested by practice, making it richer and more solid.
    Paying attention to training technical personnel in the mass movement also requires grasping the regular, meticulous, and in-depth ideological education work. Putting politics in command, letting ideology go first, arming the minds of technical personnel, organizing them to study Comrade Mao Zedong's works in depth, and having the responsible comrades of the enterprise Party organizations frequently contact them individually and talk to them heart-to-heart, so that they can eliminate the bourgeois world outlook and gradually establish the proletarian world outlook, becoming proletarian intellectuals who are both red and expert. Only in this way can their work be done better, and their participation in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement will be more active, consciously accepting the training of the mass movement.
    With the arrival of the first spring of the 1960s, the technical innovation and technical revolution on China's industrial front has shown a magnificent scene of myriad purples and reds and a hundred flowers blooming. Let us seize the great time, more fully mobilize the enthusiasm of technical personnel, organize them to closely integrate with the working masses, stride forward in the direction of being both red and expert, and play a greater role in achieving a better and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

    充分发挥技术人员的作用
    津工
    当前，许多工厂企业的技术革新和技术革命运动，正在由低到高、由简到繁、由零星的技术改革逐步发展为机械化、半机械化和自动化、半自动化的一系列的技术改造运动。大批工厂企业的职工闯进科学“禁地”，开始攀登高级、精密和尖端技术的高峰。在这种新的形势下，面临着一系列更复杂、更艰巨的技术上的问题。因此，在发动工人继续猛攻技术上的难关的同时，进一步发动技术人员参加技术革新和技术革命运动就更加重要。而技术人员在1958、1959两年的连续大跃进中，在“三结合”中，受到了深刻的教育，不仅在技术上有了显著提高，在政治思想上也有了很大的进步。同时，在大跃进中，一批具有丰富的生产实践经验的老工人又加入了技术队伍。所有这些，都为调动技术人员的积极性提供了空前有利的条件。
    要进一步发动技术人员参加技术革新和技术革命，最有效的办法就是吸引广大技术人员参加轰轰烈烈的群众运动。在群众运动的激流中，在生产实践的斗争中，锻炼、改造和提高技术人员。技术革新和技术革命，不仅改造技术，而且也能改造人的思想和技能。在技术革新和技术革命运动的过程中，必须打破束缚新事物成长的老常规，同一切因循守旧、墨守成规，按部就班的思想作斗争。受资产阶级教育影响比较深的许多技术人员，参加运动，走出实验室，经常到群众中去，到生产实际中去，就有可能使他们相信群众的力量和智慧，进一步了解生产的实际和改变思想感情。天津拖拉机厂的事实就是一个生动的例证。这个工厂的许多技术人员，大跃进以前，存在着比较严重的脱离群众、脱离实际的现象。在设计拖拉机时，有的技术人员，认为设计工作是专业人员的事情，不能搞群众运动；有的人甚至主张建立一个“封闭式”的设计科，从设计、试制到试验，自成一个体系，同工人、生产严格隔离。很明显，如果按照这个办法，必然会冷冷清清，拖拖拉拉，使拖拉机的设计迟迟不能诞生。这个厂的党委会采取了另外一种办法：组织全厂技术人员参加群众运动，插红旗、树标兵，组织竞赛。结果，全厂技术革新运动轰轰烈烈，迅速发展。去年一年中，就实现了三百多项重大的技术革新，又快又好地完成了拖拉机的设计、试制和生产。技术人员的政治觉悟提高了，技术理论知识通过实践的考验，更丰富、更扎实了。
    注意在群众运动中锻炼技术人员，还须抓紧经常性的细致深入的思想教育工作。政治挂帅，思想先行，武装技术人员的头脑，组织他们深入学习毛泽东同志的著作，企业党组织的负责同志经常地同他们个别接触，找他们谈心，使他们破除资产阶级的世界观，逐步确立无产阶级的世界观，成为又红又专的无产阶级知识分子。只有这样，他们的工作才能做得更好，参加技术革新和技术革命运动才会更加主动，自觉地接受群众运动的锻炼。
    随着六十年代第一个春天的来临，我国工业战线上的技术革新和技术革命已经出现了万紫千红百花齐放的胜景。让我们紧抓大好时光，更充分地调动技术人员的积极性，组织他们同工人群众紧密结合，向着又红又专的方向健步前进，在实现今年更好更全面的跃进中发挥更大的作用。
