Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, February 2nd: Workers at the Xinhua Iron Plant in Wengan County, Guizhou Province, have vigorously carried out transportation technology reforms in the plant area, achieving the use of rails on flat ground, cableways in the air, boat transport on water, and chutes and slides on mountain slopes. All production workshops have formed a transportation network connecting all parts of the plant, increasing transportation efficiency by an average of six times.

According to preliminary calculations by the plant, after the implementation of transportation technology reforms in the plant area, transportation costs for coke and iron alone can be reduced by more than 310,000 yuan per year. Moreover, the entire plant has freed up 280 horse-drawn carts to participate in social transportation and can transfer more than 300 transportation workers to production positions such as coking and mining. Improved transportation conditions have promoted production development. Comparing the production situation in early January with the same period in December last year before the reform, pig iron production increased by 1.53 times, coking coal production increased by 5.6 times, and ore production increased by 2.21 times. In the first half of January, more than 30,000 yuan in transportation costs were saved, and the unit cost of pig iron was reduced by 65%.

The Industry Work Department and the Transportation Work Department of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a provincial on-site meeting on factory and mine transportation in Wengan County to promote the experience of the Xinhua Iron Plant.

The Xinhua Iron Plant is a small-scale joint enterprise for iron smelting, coking, and coal mining established in 1958. Due to the rapid development of production, transportation conditions could not keep up. Although 45% of the total number of workers in the plant were engaged in transportation, the transportation volume of coal, coke, and ore still could not keep up with production needs. Only two of the four small blast furnaces could be in production. When the weather was rainy and the roads were slippery, some iron smelting workers had to be drawn out to rush transport. In October last year, the plant further implemented the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on carrying out short-distance transportation and decided to focus on local methods and a combination of local and foreign methods to vigorously carry out transportation technology reforms in the plant area and change the backward transportation situation. All the workers in the plant actively supported this decision, successively put forward more than 350 rationalization proposals, and overcame one difficulty after another in the reform process. Lacking wood, each workshop assigned special personnel to go to the mountains to cut wood and clean up old and waste materials, so that the entire plant quickly laid wooden tracks. Lacking steel cables for building aerial cableways, the workers twisted No. 8 lead wire into thick lead wire to replace them. After more than a month, the entire plant built a transportation network connecting all parts of the plant, fundamentally changing the backward transportation situation. Now, within the plant area, wooden tracks are connected horizontally and vertically, and mine cars shuttle back and forth. Transporting ore from the Shuitouba Mine to the smelting workshop, a distance of five kilometers, is no longer done by horse-drawn carts, but by small wooden boats with a load of one to one and a half tons, transported through farmland canals.

### 贵州新华铁厂大搞运输技术改革  建成四通八达的厂区运输网

    贵州新华铁厂大搞运输技术改革
    建成四通八达的厂区运输网
    新华社贵阳2日电　贵州省瓮安县新华铁厂职工大搞厂区运输技术改革，实现平地用轨道、空中用索道、水上用船运、山坡上用梭槽和滑板，各生产车间组成了一个四通八达的运输网，使运输效率平均提高了六倍。
    据这个厂的初步计算，实现厂区运输技术改革以后，仅焦、铁两项每年就可以减少运输费用三十一万多元；而且，全厂已抽出二百八十部马车参加社会运输，还可以调出三百多名运输工人，转移到炼焦、采矿等生产岗位上去。运输条件改善，促进了生产发展。拿1月上旬的生产情况与改革前的去年12月同期比较：生铁产量提高一点五三倍，焦煤产量提高五点六倍，矿石产量提高二点二一倍；1月上半月节约运输费用三万多元，生铁单位成本降低65％。
    中共贵州省委工业工作部和交通工作部最近在瓮安县召开了全省厂矿运输现场会，推广新华铁厂经验。
    新华铁厂是在1958年建立起来炼铁、炼焦、采煤小型联合企业。由于生产发展快，运输条件跟不上，全厂虽然有占职工总数45％的工人参加运输，但是煤、焦和矿石的运输量仍然跟不上生产需要，四座小高炉只能有两座生产。遇到天雨路滑，还必须抽出部分炼铁工人突击运输。去年10月，这个厂进一步贯彻中共中央和国务院关于开展短途运输的指示，决定以土为主、土洋结合的方法，大搞厂区运输技术改革，改变运输落后的状况。全厂职工积极地拥护这个决定，先后提出各种合理化建议三百五十多条，克服了改革过程中的一个又一个的困难。缺少木料，各车间就抽出专人上山伐木和清理旧料废料，使全厂很快铺上了木轨道。建架空索道没有钢索，工人们就用八号铅丝扭成粗铅丝代替。经过一个多月的时间，全厂就建起了一个四通八达的厂区运输网，基本改变了运输落后的面貌。现在在厂区内，只见木轨道纵横连接，矿车来往奔驰。由水头坝矿场运矿石到冶炼车间，五公里的路程，也不再用马车运输，而用载重一吨到一吨半的小木船，经过农田水渠运来。
