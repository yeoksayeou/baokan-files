Anhui's Iron and Steel Industry in the Great Leap Forward
Li Renzhi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

A Year of High-Speed Development

In 1959, Anhui Province's iron and steel industry achieved a new and tremendous leap forward.

The development of Anhui Province's iron and steel industry in that year had three characteristics: The first characteristic was maintaining high speed. The capital construction of the iron and steel industry was very fast. In just over five months, the province built 43 three-ton converters, eight medium and small electric furnaces, and ten sets of small rolling mills. The growth rate of iron and steel production was very large. The annual steel production in 1959 increased by more than five times compared with the "native steel" production in 1958, and the pig iron production increased by more than three times compared with the "native iron" production in 1958. In 1958, steel products could not be produced, but in 1959, more than 30,000 tons were produced. Developing the iron and steel industry at such a high speed had never happened before in the history of Anhui Province. The second characteristic was that the production level steadily increased month by month. The third characteristic was that the "small native groups" had new development and improvement. Many small enterprises that originally only produced pig iron have now developed into small-scale joint enterprises that can smelt iron, steel, and roll steel.

Developing "Small Native Groups," Improving "Small Native Groups"

In the mass iron and steel campaign in 1958, in order to complete the arduous tasks at that time and lay the foundation for the future development of the iron and steel industry, the Provincial Party Committee, based on the central government's principle of "walking on two legs" and combined with the specific conditions of Anhui Province, strengthened the construction of key iron and steel enterprises such as the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company on the one hand, and on the other hand, adopted the practice of "combining indigenous and foreign methods, with foreign methods as the main focus," and vigorously promoted the construction of "small native groups" for iron smelting according to the "four close to" principles of close to raw materials, close to transportation, close to power, and close to technology. After a short period of four months, more than 800 blast furnaces with a volume of more than eight cubic meters were built throughout the province, creating good conditions for the continued leap forward of the iron and steel industry in 1959. Based on the experience of vigorously developing "small native groups" for iron smelting in 1958, Anhui Province comprehensively developed "small native groups" on the entire iron and steel industry front in 1959. For example: vigorously developing "small native groups" for mining, "small native groups" for coking, "small native groups" for refractory materials, and "small native groups" for steelmaking and rolling. Starting in May 1959, we also vigorously promoted the construction of three-ton converters and small rolling mills, and in just over five months, the province's steelmaking capacity increased eightfold. Rolling equipment was established from scratch, laying a preliminary foundation for steel rolling. These projects played a decisive role in completing the 1959 production increase plan.

While developing "small native groups" for steelmaking, etc., we also consolidated and improved the original "small native groups" for iron smelting. In this regard, there are many problems that need to be solved, but the most prominent and fundamental issue is how to improve the utilization coefficient. Because if the utilization coefficient is improved, one furnace can play the role of two or even several furnaces, which can increase production, reduce coke ratio, save labor, and reduce production costs; the quality can also be improved accordingly. To improve the utilization coefficient, a lot of work needs to be done, and the main key is to increase air volume and air temperature. Because increasing the air volume and air temperature can increase the smelting intensity. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee has always grasped this key issue in the technical transformation of "small native groups" for iron smelting, and concentrated its efforts to systematically and thoroughly transform the air supply system. Now, most small blast furnaces have implemented dual-blower parallel air supply, expanded the tuyeres, increased the diameter and wall thickness of the air pipes, improved the joints and gates of the pipes, and implemented multi-nozzle combustion, so that the amount of air blown into the furnace per minute reaches six times the effective volume of each cubic meter of blast furnace, which is twice as high as the original design requirement. The smelting intensity has also been greatly improved. After the steel plant of the Provincial Party Committee implemented high air volume and high air temperature operation, the smelting intensity increased sharply by 40%. With the increase in smelting intensity, we further solved the problems in raw material management and other links, and promoted the comprehensive transformation of the entire production process.

After the above-mentioned transformation, very significant effects were achieved. In December of last year, the average furnace volume increased by only 7.8% compared with January, but the output increased by 168% compared with January. The technical and economic indicators of small blast furnaces have rapidly improved. For example, the utilization coefficient averaged only 0.636 in January, but reached 1.583 in December; the qualified rate of pig iron averaged only 55.7% in March, but reached 91.8% in December; the cost in November decreased by 43.8% compared with the first quarter. By January of this year, the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces had risen to 1.696. All this fully demonstrates the strong vitality of the iron and steel "small native groups."

Vigorously Carry Out Mass Movements, Deeply Develop Competition

In 1959, the mass movement on the iron and steel industry front in Anhui Province was carried out extensively and deeply, both solidly and vigorously; and the movement developed continuously and continuously rose from beginning to end. The reason why the mass movement on the iron and steel industry front in Anhui Province can be so extensive and deep is that, first of all, the red flag competition was vigorously carried out, so that competition was carried out in everything, everywhere, and by everyone, month after month, season after season, from beginning to end. In organizing the red flag competition, we focused on grasping the three links of "teaching," "raising," and "comparing." "Teaching" is to conduct situation education for employees according to the different situations of each period, so that they can see the direction and maintain strong fighting spirit. "Raising" is to propose clear goals and vivid slogans according to the different tasks and production keys of each period. For example: In the first quarter of 1959, we aimed at the situation that the "small native groups" for iron smelting had a large number of people and low labor efficiency, and proposed to vigorously rectify labor organizations, improve labor efficiency, and save labor as the main goals of each enterprise; in the second quarter, we aimed at the situation that the production of small blast furnaces was not normal enough, and proposed to improve the utilization coefficient and quality as the center to achieve high yield and high quality; in the third quarter, according to the large-scale high-yield situation in some areas, we proposed to carry out a large-scale bumper harvest competition; in the fourth quarter, we proposed to fight hard in the fourth quarter to complete the 1959 production increase plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it. "Comparing" is to conduct regular evaluations. By discussing and checking the monthly and ten-day production plans, mobilizing employees to check the gaps, identify the key points, and find the reasons, so as to discover the advanced and backward, and mobilize the masses to learn from the advanced, compare with the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and help the backward. Facts have proved that carrying out the red flag competition is a good form of carrying out mass movements, and an effective method to stimulate and improve the labor enthusiasm and revolutionary drive of the masses of employees.

In the mass movement in 1959, aiming at the characteristics that the vast number of employees had great enthusiasm and high enthusiasm, but low production technology level, we emphasized from the beginning that we should focus on technical innovation and technical revolution. Around the key issues of production, we adopted the method of "three combinations" of leading cadres, technicians, and employees to vigorously carry out iron and steel "experimental fields." Not only did leaders at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels engage in iron and steel "experimental fields," but also factories, mines, enterprises, and workshops generally engaged in iron and steel "experimental fields," creating and accumulating a lot of experience, and promptly promoted this experience, quickly breaking through the production technology barrier. For example, the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company has organized more than 1,000 technical performance competitions since November 20, 1959, and has emerged with more than 300 major technical innovations, greatly improving the level of operation technology. The lining of a three-ton converter has been shortened from the original twelve hours to fourteen minutes; the time for overhauling the pig iron furnace has been shortened from eighteen hours to more than three hours.

In terms of improving enterprise management, we also adopted the mass line method. On the one hand, we insisted that leading cadres participate in labor, and on the other hand, we organized workers to participate in management, so that leaders and those who are led are closely combined, so that the level of management is constantly improved.

Centralized Leadership, Unified Dispatch

The production of the iron and steel industry has extensive contacts with various aspects. Not only are there many internal links, but also the external involvement is very broad. Internally, to produce iron and steel, there must be close cooperation between iron smelting, refractory materials, and mining and coking departments, with each link tightly linked; externally, it requires coal, electricity, and other departments to supply sufficient raw coal and electricity, and transportation departments to transport large amounts of coke and ore to the furnace in a timely manner. With the development of the iron and steel industry, the demand for raw materials is also growing rapidly, and mining often cannot keep up with the needs. At the same time, the transportation task is heavy, the transportation volume distribution is unbalanced, and the contradiction between the large transportation volume and the small transportation capacity is very prominent. In particular, the ore and coal producing areas in Anhui are not together, and it takes many links such as highways, inland rivers, the Yangtze River, and railways to transport them from the mine to the factory, which further increases the transportation task. In addition, although Anhui's power industry has made great progress, it still cannot keep up with the rapidly developing needs of industrial production. In order to solve these problems, it is necessary to implement centralized leadership and strengthen unified dispatch.

In terms of implementing centralized leadership, the provincial, prefectural, and municipal Party committees have established industrial leading groups, and each prefectural and municipal Party committee has secretaries in charge of iron and steel production, and established industrial offices to focus on the work of the iron and steel industry. Three telephone conferences are held every month to arrange and check production work, understand the production progress every day, and solve the problems existing in production in a timely manner. Special emphasis is placed on "three major grasps." The first is to vigorously grasp the supply of raw materials. We sent cadres deep into the mines and coal mines to vigorously organize mining and strengthen dispatch work; on the other hand, we improved and enriched the transportation command organizations at all levels, arranged transportation plans on a daily basis according to production requirements, promptly allocated transportation tools, and supervised and inspected the shipment, thereby ensuring the smooth progress of iron and steel production. The second is to vigorously grasp capital construction. In order to ensure that iron and steel production has sufficient equipment capacity, we have established various temporary command organizations at different times. In 1958, a large number of small blast furnaces were built, and metallurgical industry headquarters were established from top to bottom throughout the province; in 1959, a large number of converter constructions were carried out, and steel plant construction headquarters were established from the province to the factory, concentrating manpower and material resources, unified manufacturing equipment, and concentrated construction and installation forces, building in stages and batches, greatly accelerating the construction speed and providing sufficient equipment capacity. In 1959, 70% to 90% of Anhui's steel and steel production tasks were completed by relying on new capacity. If we do not vigorously grasp capital construction and do not accelerate the construction speed through the method of centralized leadership, it would be difficult to complete the 1959 steel and steel production tasks. The third is to vigorously grasp the leadership of weak links. We take measures as soon as we find weak links. For example, in early 1959, the reason why steel production was not high was mainly due to unskilled technology. From the Provincial Party Committee to the factory and mine Party committees, they concentrated their efforts to improve the technical proficiency of workers. When the output increased, poor quality became a prominent contradiction. The Provincial Party Committee promptly convened the secretaries of the prefectural and municipal Party committees, factory and mine foremen, and technicians to specifically study countermeasures and formulate measures to quickly improve the quality. In the summer of 1959, there was a severe drought, and the amount of hydropower generation dropped sharply. The Provincial Party Committee immediately established an electricity saving office to adjust the load, save electricity, and mobilize the masses to run electricity, and tried every means to find power sources, so that the electricity consumption of iron and steel production was first guaranteed. In the process of organizing iron and steel production, concentrating efforts to solve the outstanding problems in each period is a major measure to ensure the continuous leap forward of iron and steel production.

Riding the Wind and Waves, Continuing the Leap Forward

Anhui Province's iron and steel industry production task in 1960 will have a greater leap forward on the basis of the great leap forward in 1959. The output of some products will increase several times compared with 1959, and the capital construction task will also increase greatly. In order to achieve this year's continued great leap forward, we will continue to go all out to ensure that we complete the production and construction plans for the first quarter ahead of schedule and overfulfill them. We must continue to deeply carry out the red flag competition movement centered on high yield, high quality, low cost, multiple varieties, and safe production. We must continue to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, effectively rectify labor organizations, do a good job in setting quotas and quotas, strive to improve labor productivity, and achieve increased production without increasing personnel. We must strengthen scientific research work, seize the trial production and production of new products, especially to smelt more high-quality steel and alloy steel, and increase the variety of steel products. We must strengthen capital construction work, especially to concentrate efforts on the construction of mining, coking, sintering, and rolling projects. In addition, we must strengthen transportation work.

Now the situation on the iron and steel industry front in Anhui Province is very good, and the vast number of employees are advancing bravely under the correct leadership of the Party, holding high the red flag of the general line and the great leap forward.

    跃进中的安徽钢铁工业
    中共安徽省委书记处书记　李任之
    高速度发展的一年
    1959年安徽省钢铁工业获得了新的巨大跃进。
    这一年安徽省钢铁工业的发展有三个特点：第一个特点是保持了高速度。钢铁工业的基本建设速度很快，在短短的五个多月的时间内，全省即建成了四十三座三吨转炉，建成了八座中小型电炉，十套小型轧钢机。钢铁生产增长幅度很大。1959年全年钢的产量比1958年“洋钢”产量增长五倍多，生铁产量比1958年“洋铁”产量增长三倍多，钢材1958年还不能生产，而1959年生产了三万多吨。以这样快的速度发展钢铁工业，在安徽省的历史上是从来没有过的。第二个特点是，生产水平逐月稳步上升。第三个特点是“小洋群”有了新的发展和提高。许多原来只是单一生产生铁的小企业，现在已经发展成为既能炼铁又能炼钢、轧钢的小型联合企业。
    发展“小洋群”  提高“小洋群”
    在1958年大办钢铁运动中，省委为了完成当时的繁重任务，并为以后钢铁工业的发展打下基础，根据中央提出的用“两条腿走路”的方针，结合安徽省的具体情况，一方面加强马鞍山钢铁公司等重点钢铁企业的建设，另一方面，采取“土洋结合，以洋为主”的做法，按照就原料、就交通运输、就动力、就技术的“四就”原则，大抓炼铁“小洋群”的建设。经过短短的四个月时间，全省就建成了八立方米以上的高炉八百多座，为1959年钢铁工业的继续跃进创造了良好的条件。根据1958年大搞炼铁“小洋群”的经验，安徽省1959年在整个钢铁工业战线上，全面地发展了“小洋群”。如：大搞采矿“小洋群”，炼焦“小洋群”，耐火材料“小洋群”和炼钢、轧钢“小洋群”等。从1959年5月份起，又大抓了三吨转炉和小型轧机的建设，仅用五个多月的时间，就使全省炼钢能力增长了八倍。轧钢设备则从无到有，建立了轧钢的初步基础。这些工程对完成1959年增产计划起了决定性的作用。
    我们在发展炼钢等“小洋群”的同时，还巩固和提高了原有的炼铁“小洋群”。在这方面，需要解决的问题很多，但其中最突出而又带根本性的问题，是如何提高利用系数。因为利用系数提高了，一个炉子就能起两个甚至几个炉子的作用，就可以提高产量，降低焦比，节约劳动力，降低生产成本；质量也可以随之提高。要提高利用系数，需要做很多的工作，而主要的关键是提高风量、风温。因为提高了风量、风温，就能提高冶炼强度。所以，省委对炼铁“小洋群”的技术改造，始终抓住了这一关键问题，集中力量对供风系统进行了系统的、彻底的改造。现在，大部分小高炉都实行了双风机并连送风，扩大了风口，加大了风管的直径和管壁，改进了管道的接头和闸门，实行了多嘴燃烧，使每分钟鼓入炉内的风量达到每立方米高炉有效容积的六倍，比原来设计要求提高了一倍。冶炼强度也随之大大提高了。省委机关钢铁厂实行了大风量高风温操作以后，冶炼强度陡增40％。随着冶炼强度的提高，我们又进一步解决了原料管理和其他各个环节上的问题，促进了整个生产过程的全面改造。
    经过上述改造以后，收到了十分显著的功效。去年12月份平均开炉的容积只比元月份增加7．8％，而产量却比元月份增长168％。小高炉的技术经济指标迅速提高。例如，利用系数，元月份平均只有零点六三六，12月份平均达到一点五八三；生铁合格率，3月份平均只有55．7％，12月份平均达到91．8％；成本，11月份比第一季度下降了43．8％。到今年1月份，小高炉平均利用系数又上升到1．696。这一切，都充分表明了钢铁“小洋群”具有强大的生命力。
    大搞群众运动　深入开展竞赛
    1959年安徽省钢铁工业战线的群众运动搞得广泛深入，既扎扎实实，又轰轰烈烈；而且运动自始至终都是持续不断地发展和不断高涨的。安徽省钢铁工业战线上的群众运动所以能够做到广泛深入，首先是大搞了红旗竞赛，做到了事事搞竞赛，处处搞竞赛，人人搞竞赛，月月季季搞竞赛，从头至尾搞竞赛。在组织红旗竞赛中，我们着重抓了“教”、“提”、“比”三个环节。“教”就是根据各个时期的不同形势，向职工进行形势教育，使他们看清方向，保持旺盛斗志。“提”就是根据各个时期的不同任务和生产关键提出明确的奋斗目标和鲜明生动的口号。例如：1959年第一季度我们针对炼铁“小洋群”存在的人员多、劳动效率低的情况，提出了以大力整顿劳动组织、提高劳动效率、节约劳动力作为各个企业的主要奋斗目标；第二季度针对小高炉生产不够正常的情况，提出了以提高利用系数，提高质量为中心，实现高产优质的要求；第三季度根据有些地区出现的大面积高产情况，又提出了开展大面积丰产竞赛；第四季度又提出了大战四季度，提前和超额完成1959年增产计划。“比”就是经常地进行评比。通过讨论和检查月、旬生产计划，发动职工查差距，摆关键，找原因，从而发现先进与落后，发动群众学先进、比先进、赶先进、帮后进。事实证明，开展红旗竞赛是大搞群众运动的良好形式，是激发和提高职工群众劳动热情和革命干劲的有效方法。
    1959年大搞群众运动中，我们针对广大职工干劲大、热情高，但生产技术水平低的特点，一开始就强调要以技术革新和技术革命为中心。围绕生产关键问题，我们采取领导干部、技术人员和职工群众“三结合”的方法，大搞钢铁“试验田”。不仅省、专、县各级领导干部搞钢铁“试验田”，而且各厂矿企业和车间也普遍搞钢铁“试验田”，创造和积累了很多经验，并及时地推广了这些经验，很快地突破了生产技术关。例如马鞍山钢铁公司从1959年11月20日以来，就组织了一千多次技术表演赛，共涌现出重大的技术革新三百多项；大大地提高了操作技术水平。建筑一座三吨转炉的炉衬，由原来十二小时缩短到十四分钟；大修化铁炉时间，由十八小时缩短到三个多小时。
    在改进企业管理方面，我们也采取了群众路线的方法。一方面坚持领导干部参加劳动，另一方面组织工人参加管理，使领导者和被领导者紧密结合，这样就不断地提高了管理水平。
    集中领导　统一调度
    钢铁工业生产和各方面的联系十分广泛。不仅内部环节很多，而且外部牵涉面也很广。在内部来说，生产钢铁，就必须要有炼铁、耐火材料和采矿、炼焦等部门的密切配合，一环扣住一环，环环都要扣紧；在外部来说，既需要煤炭、电力等部门供应足够的原煤和电力，还需要交通运输部门把大量的焦炭和矿石及时运到炉前。随着钢铁工业的发展，原材料需要量也增长得很快，开采时常跟不上需要。同时运输任务繁重，运量分布不平衡，运量大，运力小的矛盾非常突出。特别是安徽的矿石和煤炭的产地不在一起，从矿场运到工厂，要经过公路、内河、长江、铁路等许多环节，这就更加加大了运输的任务。此外，安徽电力工业虽然有了很大发展，但仍然跟不上工业生产迅速发展的需要。为了解决这些问题，就必须实行集中领导，加强统一调度。
    在实行集中领导方面，省、地、市委都成立了工业领导小组，每个地、市委都有书记专管钢铁生产，并设立了工业办公室，着重抓钢铁工业方面的工作。每月召开三次电话会议，布置检查生产工作，每日了解生产进度，及时解决生产中存在的问题。特别着重“三大抓”。一是大抓原材料供应。我们一面派出干部深入矿山、煤矿，大力组织开采，加强调度工作；另一方面又健全和充实了各级运输指挥机构，根据生产要求，逐日安排运输计划，及时调配运输工具，督促检查发运情况，从而保证了钢铁生产的顺利进行。二是大抓基本建设。为了保证钢铁生产有足够的设备能力，在各个不同时期，我们又成立了各种临时性的指挥机构。1958年大建小高炉，全省从上到下都成立了冶金工业指挥部；1959年大搞转炉建设，从省到厂又成立了钢厂建设指挥部，集中人力物力，统一制造设备，集中建筑安装力量，分期分批建设，大大地加快了建设速度，提供了足够的设备能力。1959年安徽钢和钢材的生产任务，有70％到90％以上是依靠新增能力来完成的。如果不大抓基本建设，不通过集中领导的方法来加快建设速度，要完成1959年钢和钢材的生产任务是会有困难的。三是大抓对薄弱环节的领导。我们一发现薄弱环节，随即采取措施。例如1959年年初发现钢铁产量不高的原因，主要是技术不熟练，从省委到厂矿党委就集中力量设法提高了工人的技术熟练程度。当产量上升以后，质量不高又成为突出的矛盾。省委就及时召集地市委书记、厂矿工长和技术人员专门研究对策，制定措施，使质量迅速提高了。1959年夏季严重干旱，水力发电量陡减，省委又立即成立了节约用电办公室，一面调整负荷，节约用电，一面发动群众办电，千方百计寻找电源，使钢铁生产的用电首先得到保证。在组织钢铁生产的过程中，对每个时期突出的问题，集中力量加以解决，是保证钢铁生产不断跃进的重大措施。
    乘风破浪　继续跃进
    安徽省1960年的钢铁工业生产任务，在1959年大跃进的基础上将有更大的跃进。有些产品产量将比1959年有成倍的增长，基本建设任务也将增长很大。为了实现今年的继续大跃进，我们将继续鼓足干劲，首先保证提前超额完成第一季度的生产建设计划。我们要继续深入开展以高产、优质、低成本、多品种和安全生产为中心的红旗竞赛运动。要继续大搞技术革新和技术革命，切实整顿劳动组织，搞好定员定额工作，努力提高劳动生产率，做到增产不增人。要加强科学研究工作，抓紧新产品的试制和生产，特别是要多炼优质钢和合金钢，增加钢材品种。要加强基本建设工作，特别要集中力量进行采矿、炼焦、烧结、轧钢等工程的建设。此外，还要加强交通运输工作。
    现在安徽省钢铁工业战线上的形势很好，广大职工正在党的正确领导下，高举总路线大跃进的红旗奋勇前进。
