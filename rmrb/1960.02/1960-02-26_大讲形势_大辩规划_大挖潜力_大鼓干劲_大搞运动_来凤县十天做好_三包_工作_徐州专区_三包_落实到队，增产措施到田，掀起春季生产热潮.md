    Greatly Emphasize the Situation, Greatly Debate Plans, Greatly Exploit Potential, Greatly Encourage Enthusiasm, Greatly Launch Movements
    Laifeng County Completes the "Three Guarantees" Work in Ten Days
    Xuzhou Prefecture Implements "Three Guarantees" to the Team Level, Increases Production Measures to the Fields, and Launches a Spring Production Upsurge
    (By our report) Hubei Laifeng County, with its one hundred and fifty-four production teams, launched a large-scale mass movement and spent about ten days to ensure that all "Three Guarantees" work was implemented. The county guarantees a total output of 180 million catties, an increase of 20% compared to the actual yield in 1958 (1959 was affected by disaster), with a planned total output of 200 million catties, striving to reach 220 million catties.
    The main experiences of this county in carrying out the "Three Guarantees" work quickly and well are as follows:
    1. Unify thinking, with the secretary taking the lead and the entire Party taking action. Rapidly rooting the 1960 "Three Guarantees" work in the minds of the masses can further promote the current spring plowing activities. However, at the beginning, some people did not have a sufficient understanding of the "Three Guarantees," thinking that production was very busy and that grasping production was more practical than grasping the "Three Guarantees"; they thought that the "Three Guarantees" had been adjusted several times in the past year, so being sloppy now and meticulous later would be acceptable. In response to these ideas, the county party committee, throughout the county, from top to bottom, seized the experience of the "Three Guarantees" driving production and launched a major debate on whether or not to implement the "Three Guarantees," thereby enabling the broad masses of cadres to realize that the "Three Guarantees" are a magic weapon for mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses, a central link in planned management, and an important production responsibility system that must be carried out conscientiously. In order to quickly implement the "Three Guarantees" work, the first secretary of the county party committee and the agricultural secretary personally conducted pilot projects in the Maodong Management Area and held an on-site meeting here, calling on the entire Party to take action to grasp the "Three Guarantees" work.
    2. A bold and thorough working method. After the four-level meetings at the county and commune levels, the county convened large-scale meetings with production team cadres, small team cadres, activists, and commune member representatives, by management area, sitting face-to-face to discuss and decide on the "Three Guarantees" targets. Then they returned to their small teams to convey the information to the masses and launch a mass debate. This avoided the past phenomenon of distributing targets level by level and also avoided the phenomenon of not being able to implement them quickly. Approximately 15,000 to 20,000 people from the county's 154 production teams participated in the meetings, where they were vigorously promoted, straightforward, and greatly emphasized the situation, greatly debated plans, greatly exploited potential, greatly discussed measures, and greatly encouraged enthusiasm. This sparked a vigorous mass movement to formulate "Three Guarantees" plans.
    3. To ensure that the "Three Guarantees" are implemented without being too high or too low, it is necessary to boldly mobilize the masses and carry out a major debate centered on technological innovation, deeply mobilize the masses, summarize the experience of the great disaster and bumper harvest in 1959, and carry out a major debate centered on technological innovation. During the "Three Guarantees" process, two prominent ideas emerged: first, when determining the labor force, people said that there was too much work to do and that the labor force could not handle it, and that one person could not catch two fish at the same time; second, when determining the output, they only wanted to guarantee a low output, fearing that guaranteeing a high output would not be achievable. In response to these two ideas, all localities conducted major debates on technological revolution, emphasizing making a big deal out of "innovation." After the Qiansheng Production Team in the Maodong Management Area encountered labor force difficulties, they vigorously carried out tool reforms, proposing the slogans of "Five Reforms" and "Three Eliminations." Within five or six days, some reservoir construction sites installed pulleys and trolleys, enabling the loading, transporting, unloading, and tamping of soil to all be realized with improved tools, greatly improving labor efficiency. Regarding the idea of fearing to guarantee a high output, the broad masses generally conducted three major summaries: starting from the distribution of final accounts, summarizing the great disaster and bumper harvest; starting from winter production, summarizing the great drought and great leap forward; and starting from the "Eight-Character Charter," summarizing the great changes and great increases in production. During the "Three Guarantees" debate, the Fengyi Management Area summarized the typical example of Yang Zhiguo's small team, which achieved a bumper harvest by listening to the Party's words, and the lesson of Li Daoyu's small team, which reduced production by 10% in 1959 compared to 1958 because they did not listen to the Party's words. After such summaries and comparisons, the commune members' awareness was raised, and they realized ideologically that only by listening to the Party's words and vigorously carrying out technological innovation was the only way to increase production.
    Through carrying out debates, breaking down conservative ideas, and raising ideological understanding, the specific "Three Guarantees, Five Determinations, and Four Implementations to the Field" were carried out. "Three Guarantees" are: first, guarantee output, guaranteeing total output and determining yield per unit area; second, guarantee work points, guaranteeing work according to the difficulty of cultivation and the situation of tool reform; third, guarantee investment, guaranteeing it all at once for the whole year, paying in installments, with savings going to the small team and no additional subsidies for excesses. "Five Determinations" are: first, determine the labor force; second, determine wages; third, determine the area; fourth, determine measures to increase production; and fifth, determine reward and punishment systems. "Four Implementations to the Field" are: crop yield to the field, technical specifications to the field, labor work points to the field, and measures to increase production to the field. The approach was: first "Five Determinations" then "Three Guarantees"; first planning, then guaranteeing output; first democratic determination from bottom to top, then carrying out "Three Guarantees" from top to bottom. This combination of top-down and bottom-up, repeated discussions, enabled the "Three Guarantees" to take root firmly in the minds of the commune members, achieving early knowledge of five things: total income, total output, wage supply standards, technical measures, and reward and punishment systems.
    The "Three Guarantees" and "Five Determinations" directly promoted current production, greatly mobilizing the commune members' enthusiasm for production. The county plans to manufacture more than 3,000 various types of vehicles, install more than 1,000 pulleys, cultivate 77,000 mu of paddy fields, and cultivate more than 2,000 mu of seedling fields; the second cultivation work for summer crops has basically been completed.
    (By our report) Jiangsu Xuzhou Prefecture, on the basis of formulating specific plans at all levels, used the methods of having the secretary take the lead, combining top-down and bottom-up approaches, and engaging in discussions by all the people to universally implement the "Three Guarantees" (guaranteeing work, guaranteeing costs, and guaranteeing output) to the team level, and to determine a whole set of production responsibility systems such as crop layout, production increase measures, business management, and work point evaluation and recording as early as possible, thereby mobilizing the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses and launching a high tide of spring production.
    This year, Xuzhou Prefecture's "Three Guarantees" work was carried out with spring plowing being earlier than in previous years. As of February 20, more than 90% of the district's 2,295 production brigades had formulated "Three Guarantees" plans, and about 80% of the brigades had implemented crops, targets, and measures to the fields, and inserted signs in the fields by team and group, so that responsibilities were assigned to individuals. Now the masses all know what to plant on which plot, how much to harvest, and how to plant it. At the same time, they know how much work they do, how many work points they get, and how much grain and cash they can distribute.
    The characteristics of this year's "Three Guarantees" work in Xuzhou Prefecture are: clear direction and early action. After the Wanglou Production Team of the Suicheng Commune in Suining County formulated the "Three Guarantees," it immediately inspected the crops in the fields and found that the rape fields were short of fertilizer. That day, they immediately organized the transportation of fertilizer and top-dressed all the rape fields. After the cadres of the Huancheng Brigade of the Chengguan Commune in Feng County implemented the "Three Guarantees," they immediately changed the labor organization and established a strike force of more than 300 people to eliminate the three types of weak seedlings of the three wheat crops, with five people responsible for one mu and a deadline for elimination.
    In the process of "Three Guarantees," in accordance with the spirit of "vigorously engaging in high yields, striving for continuous plots, adapting to local conditions, and changing conditions," and adhering to the spirit of both grasping high yields and grasping staple grains, both grasping grain and grasping cash crops, and both ensuring national plans and taking care of the needs of the masses, the crop layout was implemented level by level to the end, ensuring the comprehensive development of various crops and the simultaneous leap forward of poor and rich teams. After extensive airing of views and debates, many communes further analyzed the situation and further established the "chessboard" viewpoint, criticized the thinking of emphasizing grain over cotton and oil, and emphasizing high yields while neglecting minor grains. According to the natural conditions and high-yield experience of "fertile soil for corn, sweet potatoes planted on high ground, low-lying areas with water converted to paddy fields, sandy and slightly alkaline soil for cotton, plains and lakes for wheat, and flying sand and heavy alkali for fruit and mulberry," under the premise of comprehensively arranging grain, oil, cotton, vegetables, fruits, silk, and hemp, the focus was on seizing the summer harvest and doing everything possible to expand the spring planting area. The area planted with three wheat crops in the entire district increased by more than 2 million mu compared to last year, and high-yield crops such as spring corn and spring sweet potatoes increased by more than 1 million mu compared to last year. This will enable high yields and abundant harvests, avoid disasters and ensure harvests, improve land utilization, and adjust between busy and slack seasons.
    Another characteristic of this year's "Three Guarantees" is that it is carried out under the conditions of comprehensive leap forward, continuous crop plots, and high-standard specifications, so it brings many new problems. First of all, the principle of determining the guaranteed output target should be active and reliable, with the potential to exceed the target. Generally, it is based on the national plan, referring to the actual output in 1959 and the potential for increased production this year, so that the "Three Guarantees" target is about 20% higher than the actual output in 1959; secondly, guaranteeing work must be based on the high-target measures requirements and the revised labor quotas, by mu and by crop. Due to high specifications and standards, and large continuous crop plots, it is easy to have contradictions in guaranteeing work where the number of workers needed is greater than the number of workers available, and where the work guaranteed by each team is vastly different. The solution to this contradiction lies in skillful work and vigorous technological revolution. The Damiao Commune in Tongshan County needed 8,900 more workdays than the number of workdays that commune members could provide, but this difference could be offset by reforming soil carts and implementing the four-to-the-field system of courtyards, pigsties, cattle sheds, and manure ponds.
    The third characteristic is that, in accordance with the policy of running the commune diligently and thriftily, costs are guaranteed item by item and by crop, with a one-time guarantee, and profits and losses are borne by the team itself.

    大讲形势　大辩规划　大挖潜力　大鼓干劲　大搞运动
    来凤县十天做好“三包”工作
    徐州专区“三包”落实到队，增产措施到田，掀起春季生产热潮
    本报讯　湖北来凤县一百五十四个生产队大搞群众运动，用十天左右的时间，做到“三包”工作全部落实。全县包产一亿八千万斤，比1958年实收产量增加20％（1959年受灾），计划总产量二亿斤，争取达到二亿二千万斤。
    这个县“三包”工作既快又好，主要经验有以下几点：
    一、统一思想，书记挂帅，全党动手。把1960年“三包”工作迅速在群众思想上生根落脚，就可以进一步推动当前备耕活动。但开始时有部分人对“三包”认识不足，认为生产很忙，抓生产比抓“三包”现实些；认为过去“三包”一年要调整几次，现在马虎点，以后细致点。根据这些思想，县委在全县范围内，自上而下抓住“三包”推动生产的经验，开展了要不要“三包”的大辩论，从而使广大干部认识到“三包”是调动群众积极性一个法宝，是计划管理的中心环节，是重要的生产责任制，必须认真作好。为了使“三包”工作迅速落实，县委第一书记和农业书记亲自在卯洞管理区搞试点，并在这里开现场会议，号召全党动手抓“三包”工作。
    二、大手大脚，一竿到底的工作方法。在县和公社四级会议以后，全县以管理区为单位召开有生产队干部、小队干部、积极分子和社员代表参加的大会，面对面坐在一起，讨论和决定“三包”指标。然后回到小队向群众传达，开展群众性的大辩论。这样就避免了过去层层分配指标，也避免了不能迅速落实的现象。全县一百五十四个生产队，参加大会的约有一万五千到二万人，在会上大张旗鼓，开门见山，大讲形势，大辩规划，大挖潜力，大讲措施，大鼓干劲。从而掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的制订“三包”规划的群众运动。
    三、要“三包”既不偏高也不偏低地落实下来，就需要放手发动群众，开展以技术改革为中心的大辩论，深入发动群众，总结1959年大灾大丰收经验，开展技术改革为中心的大辩论。在“三包”过程中突出的有两种思想，一是定劳动力时，说活路多，劳力搞不过来，一双手捉不到两个鱼；二是定产量时，只想包低，怕包高了达不到。针对这两种思想，各地都通过开展技术革命大辩论，强调在“改”字上大做文章。卯洞管理区潜胜生产队碰到劳动力困难后，就大搞工具改革，提出“五改”、“三消灭”的口号，在五、六天内，有的水库工地上，就安上了滑丝、滑车，使装土、运土、卸土、打夯全部实现改良工具化，大大提高了劳动效率。对怕把产量包高了的思想，广大群众普遍进行了三大总结：从分配决算入手，总结大灾大丰收；从冬季生产入手，总结大旱大跃进；从“八字宪法”入手，总结大改大增产。丰衣管理区在“三包”辩论中，总结了杨治国小队，听党的话获得大丰收的典型；李道育小队，不听党的话，使1959年比1958年减产10％的教训。经过这样总结对比后，提高了社员觉悟，从思想上认识到，只有听党的话，大搞技术改革，才是增产的唯一道路。
    通过开展辩论，破除保守思想，提高思想认识后，具体进行了“三包、五定、四到田”。“三包”是：一包产，包总产、定单产；二包工分，根据耕作难易和工具改革情况进行包工；三包投资，全年一次包定，分期付款，节约归小队，超过的不补。“五定”是：一定劳力，二定工资，三定面积，四定增产措施，五定奖惩制度。“四到田”是：作物产量到田，技术规格到田，劳动工分到田，增产措施到田。在作法上是：先“五定”后“三包”；先规划，后包产；先自下而上民主定，后自上而下的搞“三包”。这样上下相结合，反复讨论，使“三包”在社员思想上牢固扎根，作到总收入、总产量、工资供给标准、技术措施、奖惩制度等五个早知道。
    通过“三包”、“五定”直接推动了当前生产，大大地调动了社员生产的积极性。全县计划制造各种车子三千多辆，安装滑丝一千多条；整水田七万七千亩，整秧田二千多亩；夏收作物的二道培育工作基本结束。
    本报讯　江苏徐州专区在层层制订具体规划的基础上，运用书记挂帅，上下结合，全民讨论的方法，普遍执行了“三包”（包工、包成本、包产量）到队，及早把作物布局、增产措施、经营管理、评工记分等一整套生产责任制度定下来，从而调动了干部、群众的积极性，掀起了春季大生产运动高潮。
    今年，徐州专区的“三包”工作，是在备耕比往年提前的情况下进行的。到2月20日止，全区二千二百九十五个生产大队，已有90％以上订好“三包”方案，并有80％左右的大队做到作物、指标、措施落实到田，并按队按组在田头插牌，使责任到人。现在群众都知道哪块地种什么，收多少，怎么种，同时，知道自己干多少活，得多少工分，能分多少粮食和现钱。
    今年徐州专区的“三包”工作特点是：方向明确，行动早。睢宁县睢城公社王娄生产队，制定“三包”后，立即检查了在田作物，发现油菜田内缺肥，当天立即组织运肥，将油菜田全部压了一遍肥。丰县城关公社环城大队的干部，“三包”后立即改变了劳动组织，新建了三百多人的消灭三麦三类苗突击队，五人包一亩，限期消灭。
    在“三包”过程中，各地根据“大搞高产，力求连片，因地制宜，改变条件”的精神，本着既抓高产，又抓主粮；既抓粮食，又抓经济作物；既保证国家计划，又照顾群众需要的精神，把作物布局层层落实，一竿到底，保证各项作物全面发展，穷队和富队一齐跃进。不少公社经过鸣放辩论，具体分析，进一步树立了“一盘棋”观点，批判了重粮食轻棉油，重高产忽视小杂粮的思想，根据“肥沃土壤种玉米，山芋栽在高地上，洼地有水改水稻，沙质轻碱棉花长，平原湖地多种麦，飞沙重碱植果桑”的自然条件和丰产经验，在全面安排粮、油、棉、菜、果、丝、麻等前提下，重点抓住夏熟丰收和千方百计扩大春播面积。全区三麦面积比去年扩大二百多万亩，春玉米、春山芋等高产作物比去年扩大一百多万亩，这样就可高产多收，避灾保收，既提高土地利用率，又能调剂忙闲。
    今年“三包”另一特点，是在全面跃进，作物连片，规格高标准的情况下进行的，因此带来很多新问题。首先确定包产指标的原则应该是积极可靠，有产可超。一般是根据国家计划，参照1959年实产和今年增产潜力，使“三包”指标高于1959年实产二成左右；其次，包工必须根据高指标的措施要求和修订后的劳动定额，按亩按作物进行。由于规格标准高，作物大连片，包工中容易发生需用工数大于出工数，以及各队之间包工悬殊的矛盾，解决这个矛盾的办法在于巧干，大力进行技术革命。铜山县大庙公社需用工数大于社员可能出工数八千九百多个工日，经过改造土车，实行场屋、猪圈、牛棚、粪塘四到田等办法就可以抵上这个差额。
    第三个特点是，根据勤俭办社的方针，分项、分作物进行包本，一次包定，自负盈亏。
