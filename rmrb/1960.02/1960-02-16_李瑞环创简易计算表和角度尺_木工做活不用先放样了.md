Xinhua News Agency report: Li Ruihuan, captain of the carpentry youth shock brigade of the Beijing Third Construction Engineering Company, using the principles of trigonometry and geometry, created a set of simple calculation tables and angle rulers for carpentry. This broke the old convention that carpenters had to lay out complex work before cutting materials, increasing production efficiency by one to twenty times.

In the past, when carpenters made complex items such as roof trusses and eaves, they would first assemble a wooden board on the ground, the same size as the actual item, and then lay out the full-size pattern according to the drawings before cutting the materials. This was complex and time-consuming, requiring skilled workers of grade six or above. Laying out the pattern often took longer than making the actual item. After Li Ruihuan created the calculation method and angle ruler, ordinary workers could use simple multiplication and division to calculate the cutting dimensions for a whole set of carpentry work, such as roof trusses, stairs, spiral staircases, herringbone floors, chimney water towers, curved formwork, gambrel roofs, and triangular skylight roofs, directly from the drawing's proportions, and then cut the materials directly.

    木工做活不用先放样了
    据新华社讯　北京市第三建筑工程公司木工青年突击队队长李瑞环，运用三角、几何原理，创制出一套木工简易计算表和角度尺，打破了木工做复杂活必须先放样才能下料的陈规，使生产效率提高一倍到二十倍。
    木工做屋架、屋檐等复杂的活，一向是先在地上拼铺成和实物面积一样大的木板，按照图纸放成大样下料。这样做既复杂又费时，需要六级以上的老工人才能干，把图纸放成大样，往往比做实物的时间还长。李瑞环创造的计算法和角度尺出现后，一般工人即可用简单的乘除法，按照图纸比例计算出屋架、楼梯、转盘楼梯、人字地板、烟囱水塔、弧形?胎、马尾屋顶和三角形天窗屋顶等整套木工活的下料尺寸，直接下料。
