Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 7th. The "Red Right Daily" said in a commentary today entitled "A Historic Milestone of Friendship" that the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression between China and Burma and the agreement on the border issue between the two countries are a new model of solidarity and friendship between Asian countries.

The commentary pointed out that it is particularly noteworthy that the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression is the first peace treaty of this nature signed between Asian countries. Not only does it have important historical significance in itself, but also, in light of the United States' continuous and active attempts to influence the diplomatic direction of independent Asian countries in its foreign policy, and to turn non-socialist countries against socialist countries, this treaty also has important historical significance.

The commentary also stated that Article 3 of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression, which guarantees that neither party will participate in military alliances directed against the other, is an important component of the treaty. It deprives of their foothold all attempts to induce Burma to deviate from its neutral policy and to drag it into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

The commentary pointed out that those who are hostile to Sino-Burmese friendship have placed many hopes on the long-unresolved border issue between China and Burma. Not long ago, Western newspapers even published articles predicting that the border issue would inevitably cause conflict between China and Burma. Obviously, conflict between China and Burma is only their hope. However, the leaders of China and Burma, through talks and exchanges of letters, signed an agreement that in principle resolves this issue. The joint committee to be established will resolve various specific issues based on the principles stipulated in the agreement.

The commentary finally emphasized that the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the agreement on the border issue are examples of applying the principles of peaceful coexistence in practice. These documents stand in sharp contrast to the military agreement recently signed between the United States and Japan, which has been condemned by the Asian people as detrimental to peace. The People's Republic of China and Burma have demonstrated the vitality of the idea of ​​peaceful coexistence with facts, and the possibility of resolving existing problems amicably in the spirit of peaceful coexistence. The treaties and agreements signed in Beijing have a positive impact on the relations between all Asian countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 8th. The Indonesian "People's Daily" said today in a commentary on the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the agreement on the border issue that the signing of this treaty and agreement clearly shows that as long as the spirit of Bandung and the spirit of peaceful coexistence are embodied in action, there will be no disputes between Asian countries.

The newspaper pointed out that the Sino-Burmese treaty and agreement are a direct blow to the imperialist policy. Imperialism has been trying every possible means to divide the anti-imperialist forces in Asia, especially attempting to alienate China from other Asian countries.

The newspaper believes that the Sino-Burmese border issue is not simple, but both sides have reached a consensus and concluded an agreement that is definitely beneficial to both sides. This is because the problem is solved according to the spirit of Bandung and the spirit of peaceful coexistence, instead of paying lip service to the spirit of Bandung and the spirit of peaceful coexistence while taking actions that run counter to it.

The newspaper welcomed the Sino-Burmese treaty and hoped that Asian countries, especially Southeast Asian countries, would follow this example, so that imperialists would not be able to implement the policy of Asians fighting Asians advocated by the late US Secretary of State Dulles.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, February 8th. According to reports in the newspapers here today, U Nu, chairman of the Clean Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma, said here on the 7th that he agreed with the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the agreement on the border issue recently signed by the prime ministers of Burma and China.

Preliminary results of the Burmese elections show that the candidates of the Clean Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League defeated all opponents of the Consolidated Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League in Rangoon and won an absolute majority in many county constituencies.

U Nu praised General Ne Win for signing the border agreement with China.

    捷“红色权利报”和印度尼西亚“人民日报”指出
    中缅条约创亚洲团结友好新范例
    吴努表示同意中缅友好条约和边界协定
    新华社布拉格7日电　“红色权利报”今天在一篇题为“友谊的历史性的里程碑”的评论中说，中缅两国签订的友好和互不侵犯条约以及关于两国边界问题的协定，是亚洲国家之间团结友好的新范例。
    评论指出，特别值得注意的是，中缅友好和互不侵犯条约是亚洲国家之间签订的第一个这类性质的和平条约。不仅它本身具有重要的历史意义，而且就美国在外交政策中不断积极地试图影响亚洲独立国家的外交方向、使非社会主义国家反对社会主义国家而言，这一条约也具有重要的历史意义。
    评论还说，中缅友好和互不侵犯条约中关于缔约双方保证不参加针对另一方的军事同盟的第三条，是条约中的重要的组成部分。它使一切想促使缅甸脱离中立政策道路、把缅甸拉入东南亚条约组织的企图丧失了立足的土壤。
    评论指出，敌视中缅友谊的分子对中缅两国长期未曾解决的边界问题寄予不少希望。不久前在西方的报纸上还出现过预言什么边界问题一定会使中缅两国之间产生冲突的文章。显而易见，中缅之间发生冲突只是他们的希望。但中缅两国的领导人通过会谈、交换信件，签订了原则上解决这一问题的协定。将要成立的联合委员会将依据协定上规定的原则解决各种具体问题。
    评论最后强调指出，中缅友好和互不侵犯条约以及关于两国边界问题的协定，是在实践中运用和平共处原则的范例。这些文件同不久以前美国和日本签订的、被亚洲人民谴责为有害于和平的军事协定，形成了尖锐的对照。中华人民共和国和缅甸以事实证明了和平共处思想的生命力，证明了本着和平共处思想友好谅解地解决现存问题的可能性。在北京签订的条约和协定对整个亚洲国家间的关系起着积极的影响。
    新华社雅加达8日电　印度尼西亚“人民日报”今天在评论中缅友好和互不侵犯条约及关于边界问题的协定时说，这个条约和协定的签订十分清楚地表明，只要在行动中体现了万隆精神及和平共处的精神，亚洲各国之间就不会发生任何争端。
    这家报纸指出，中缅条约和协定是对帝国主义政策的直接打击。帝国主义一直在千方百计地分化亚洲的反帝力量，特别是企图离间中国同其它亚洲国家的关系。
    这家报纸认为，中缅边界问题并不简单，而双方取得了一致的看法，缔结了肯定对双方有利的协定。这是因为根据万隆精神及和平共处的精神来解决问题，而不是空谈万隆精神及和平共处的精神而又采取与此背道而驰的行动。
    这家报纸对中缅条约表示欢迎，并希望，亚洲国家，特别是东南亚国家，将效法这一范例，从而使帝国主义者无法执行已故美国国务卿杜勒斯提倡的亚洲人打亚洲人的政策。
    新华社仰光8日电　据这里的报纸今天报道，缅甸廉洁的反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努7日在这里表示，他同意缅中两国总理最近签订的友好和互不侵犯条约和关于边界问题的协定。
    缅甸选举的初步结果表明廉洁的反法西斯人民自由同盟的候选人在仰光击败了巩固的反法西斯人民自由同盟的所有对手，并且在许多县的选区赢得了绝对多数。
    吴努赞扬奈温将军同中国签订边界协定。
