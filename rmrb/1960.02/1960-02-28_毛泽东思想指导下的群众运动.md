Mass Movements Under the Guidance of Mao Zedong Thought
Preface to the Book "The Red Flag of Implementing the General Line" by Li Fuchun

    After celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council convened the National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Industry, Transportation, Capital Construction, and Finance and Trade. At this national gathering of heroes, advanced representatives introduced the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, allowing us to see the immense power of mass movements under Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution! The advanced deeds of advanced collectives and advanced producers are deeply encouraging. It strengthens our conviction that as long as we truly grasp and apply Mao Zedong Thought, we can correctly embody the leadership of the Party, correctly implement the Party's general line, correctly organize the Great Leap Forward in production and construction, correctly give play to the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, and continuously push revolutionary mass movements from one high tide to a new high tide, leading from victory to new victories.

    Mass movements under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought are full of the spirit of continuous revolution. In class struggle and production struggle, we are both proponents of the stages of revolutionary development and proponents of continuous revolution. We believe that socialism and communism are two qualitatively different stages, but we also believe that there is no, nor should there be, a Great Wall separating socialism and communism. We communists and the working class engage in revolution to ultimately realize a communist society. Communism is the highest interest of the working class and the working people. We are never satisfied with the achievements we have made and always inspire the masses with the highest goals of the revolution, educate the masses with the spirit of communism, and, on the basis of constantly improving the consciousness of the masses, continuously lead the masses' surging revolutionary enthusiasm towards new goals of struggle. The Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism highly embodies this spirit of continuous revolution. Therefore, we must constantly educate the masses, firmly establish the lofty aspirations of the working class, and unremittingly strive for the noble cause of building socialism and realizing communism. This is the world view of the proletariat. With this world view and the spirit of continuous revolution, we can muster revolutionary vigor, break down superstitions, liberate our minds, oppose right-leaning tendencies, carry out technological revolution and cultural revolution, continuously transform people's political and ideological outlook, continuously change the backward state of "poverty and blankness," continuously reform regulations and systems that hinder production, and continuously open up paths for the development of social productive forces. This creates sufficient spiritual and material conditions for building socialism and realizing communism. The experience and achievements of advanced collectives and advanced producers fully reflect the great vitality of this spirit of continuous revolution. With the spirit of continuous revolution, they are giving play to the infinite wisdom of the working class, demonstrating the perseverance of the working class, and displaying the communist fighting style of the working class. Therefore, in the face of them, all difficulties are overcome one by one; our cause has also grown from nothing to something, from small to large, from less to more, from manual operation to mechanization, from mechanization to automation, climbing all the way to the peaks of science and technology and culture; while backward thinking, backward technology, backward culture, and backward social customs are rapidly changing. The thoughts and actions of those listless cowards and lazy people have been scorned by the vast majority of workers and staff, the communist fighting style has become the code of conduct for the broad masses, and a vigorous mass movement has been launched. As long as we always muster revolutionary vigor, highly promote the communist style, hold high the red flag of the general line, thoroughly oppose right-leaning tendencies, and completely break down superstitions, we will certainly build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science in a not very long period of time.

    Mass movements under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought are guided by the Party's mass line. The people are the creators of human history. Comrade Mao Zedong has expounded this principle in many of his works. In his article "Introducing a Cooperative," he more explicitly pointed out: "In addition to the leadership of the Party, 600 million people are a decisive factor. With more people, there are more discussions, higher enthusiasm, and greater drive." Our enterprises, especially advanced enterprises, following the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and first rely on the vast number of activists, advanced elements, and advanced collective units, so that our cause has been rapidly developed. In socialist construction, it is precisely because we have brought into play the leading, backbone, and bridging role of these advanced producers and advanced units, set up pacesetters for the masses, and rapidly turned advanced experience into the wealth of the whole society, making the advanced ranks grow day by day; conversely, this has enriched advanced experience and continuously created new advanced experience, which, after being promoted and improved again, has continuously expanded the advanced ranks; this cycle continues endlessly, making the movement surge one wave higher than another. "From the masses, to the masses, concentrate, and persevere" is a brilliant mass line charter for Comrade Mao Zedong to guide mass movements. Since the enterprise rectification movement in 1958, this mass line working method has been further developed in many advanced enterprises. The methods, systems, and forms such as great contending, great blooming, great debates, posting big-character posters, the "two participations, one reform, three combinations" system, and new forms of labor competition such as large-scale collaboration competitions and technical performance competitions are the results of implementing the Party's mass line. This set of methods, systems, and forms has become a powerful guarantee for these enterprises to continuously inspire the masses, concentrate the wisdom of the masses, solve key production problems, create production miracles, change the face of enterprises, and carry out technological innovation and technological revolution movements. The Party's general line for socialist construction and a whole set of policies for walking on two legs, personally formulated by Chairman Mao, are the highest embodiment of the Party's mass line. By implementing this general line and this whole set of policies, we can mobilize the positive factors in all aspects. Therefore, whether it is industry or agriculture, whether it is heavy industry or light industry, whether it is a central enterprise or a local enterprise, whether it is a large enterprise or a small and medium-sized enterprise, whether it is using foreign methods for production or indigenous methods for production, due to simultaneous implementation and mutual combination, this has greatly brought into play the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of workers and staff in all walks of life, and there have emerged thousands upon thousands of advanced collectives and advanced producers, making the mass line shine brightly and greatly changing the face of the national economy.

    Mass movements under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought are constantly developing under the guidance of dialectical materialism. The Party and Comrade Mao Zedong often teach us that we must look at problems from a developmental point of view rather than from a static point of view, from a comprehensive point of view rather than from a one-sided point of view, and from the essence of things rather than from the superficial phenomena of things. Comrade Mao Zedong tells us that we must observe the internal contradictions of things and propose different solutions according to the different nature of the contradictions. Under the leadership of the Party, according to this teaching of Comrade Mao Zedong, in the mass movement, we have correctly handled a series of contradictions, so that the movement can develop rapidly. For example, in handling the relationship between politics and material things, we have implemented the principle of putting politics in command, while not neglecting the principle of material encouragement; in dealing with the relationship between the advanced and the backward, we have carried out labor competitions to compare with the advanced, catch up with the advanced, learn from the advanced, and help the backward, and applied the principle of mutual learning, mutual assistance, drawing on each other's strengths to overcome one's weaknesses, and common improvement; in dealing with difficult problems, we have embodied the spirit of despising difficulties strategically and paying attention to difficulties tactically; in reforming enterprise rules and regulations, we have achieved both destruction and construction, combining centralized leadership with large-scale mass movements; in the guidance of mass production movements, we have followed the principles of combining work and rest and developing in a wave-like manner; in the issue of technological innovation, we have promoted the spirit of combining soaring revolutionary drive with scientific analysis; in the relationship between production and life, we have implemented the principle of grasping both production and life, and gradually improving life on the basis of developing production; and so on. The Party's general line for socialist construction highly embodies Comrade Mao Zedong's dialectical materialist point of view. This general line closely combines the high degree of development of the subjective initiative of the people with the objective possibility of high-speed development of the national economy. In this way, the enthusiasm of all aspects can be mobilized, and the labor enthusiasm of the masses can be consolidated, so that industrial and agricultural production can continue to maintain the speed of the Great Leap Forward. In short, the experience of advanced enterprises fully proves that the result of guiding mass movements with dialectical materialism is that various contradictions are correctly resolved, thereby creating lively, rich, and colorful forms of mass movement, unprecedented spiritual excitement, high morale, and spirited mass enthusiasm, and creating an unprecedented prosperous and flourishing situation in the history of socialist construction in our country.

    Mass movements under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought have already blossomed with the most beautiful flowers and yielded the most abundant fruits. In the past, relying on Mao Zedong Thought to guide mass movements has achieved the great victory of the Great Leap Forward; in the future, we believe that as long as we adhere unswervingly and more consciously to mastering Mao Zedong Thought, even greater victories will surely emerge. Let us learn from the experience of the National Congress of Heroes and advance bravely with the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought held even higher!

    毛泽东思想指导下的群众运动
    “执行总路线的红旗”一书的序言　李富春
    庆祝建国十周年过后，中共中央和国务院召开了全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财政贸易方面先进集体和先进生产者代表大会。在这个全国的群英大会上，先进代表介绍了1958年和1959年大跃进的伟大成就，使我们看出在马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想指导下的群众运动，具有多么大的威力！先进集体和先进生产者的先进事迹，令人十分鼓舞。它使我们坚信，只要真正地掌握并且运用毛泽东思想，我们就能正确地体现党的领导，正确地贯彻执行党的总路线，正确地组织生产建设的大跃进，正确地发挥人民公社的无比优越性，把革命的群众运动，不断地从高潮推向新的高潮，从胜利引向新的胜利。
    毛泽东思想指导下的群众运动，是充满着不断革命精神的。我们在阶级斗争和生产斗争中，既是革命发展阶段论者，又是不断革命论者。我们认为社会主义和共产主义是两个不同质的阶段，但我们又认为社会主义和共产主义之间没有隔着也不允许隔着万里长城。我们共产党人和工人阶级干革命，是为了最后实现共产主义社会的。共产主义是工人阶级和劳动人民的最高利益。我们永远不满足于已得的成就，总是以革命的最高目的来鼓舞群众，以共产主义精神来教育群众，在群众觉悟不断提高的基础上，把群众高涨的革命热情，不断地引向新的奋斗目标。党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线就高度体现了这种不断革命的精神。因此，我们必须时刻教育群众，巩固地树立工人阶级的雄心壮志，为建成社会主义和实现共产主义的崇高事业而不懈地奋斗。这是无产阶级的世界观。有了这个世界观和不断革命的精神，才能鼓起革命干劲，破除迷信，解放思想，反对右倾，开展技术革命和文化革命，不断地改造人们的政治思想面貌，不断地改变“一穷二白”的落后状况，不断地改革妨碍生产的规章制度，不断地为发展社会生产力开辟道路。这就为建成社会主义和实现共产主义，创造着充分的精神条件和物质条件。先进集体和先进生产者的经验和成就，充分反映了这种不断革命精神的伟大生命力。他们以不断革命的精神，发挥着工人阶级的无穷智慧，表现了工人阶级坚韧不拔的毅力，显示了工人阶级共产主义的战斗风格。因此，在他们面前，一切困难都一个一个地被克服了；我们的事业，也从无到有，从小到大，从少到多，从手工操作到机械化，从机械化到自动化，一直攀登到科学技术高峰和文化高峰；而落后的思想、落后的技术、落后的文化和落后的社会风尚，却正在迅速改变。那些萎靡不振的懦夫和懒汉的思想言行已经为广大职工所鄙弃，共产主义者的战斗风格，已经成为广大群众的行动准则，轰轰烈烈的群众运动开展起来了。只要我们始终鼓足革命干劲，高度发扬共产主义风格，把总路线的红旗高高举起，把右倾反透，把迷信破净，我们就一定会在不很长的时间内，把我国建成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国。
    毛泽东思想指导下的群众运动，是以党的群众路线为指导原则的。人民群众是人类历史的创造者。毛泽东同志在他的许多著作里，都阐明了这个原理。在他的“介绍一个合作社”那篇文章里，更明确地指出：“除了党的领导之外，六亿人口是一个决定的因素。人多议论多，热气高，干劲大。”我们的企业，尤其是先进企业，遵循着党和毛主席的教导，相信群众，依靠群众，首先依靠广大的积极分子、先进分子，以及先进的集体单位，使我们的事业得到了迅速的发展。我们在社会主义建设中，正因为发挥了这些先进生产者和先进单位的带头、骨干、桥梁作用，给群众树立了标兵，使先进经验迅速地变为全社会的财富，使先进队伍日益扩大起来；反过来，这又丰富了先进经验，并不断地创造了新的先进经验，经过再推广，再提高，先进队伍又不断扩大；这样循环往复，永无休止，使运动一浪高过一浪。“从群众中来，到群众中去，集中起来，坚持下去”，这是毛泽东同志指导群众运动的一条英明的群众路线的宪章。1958年企业整风运动以来，这条群众路线的工作方法，在许多先进企业里更有了新的发展。大鸣大放、大辩论，贴大字报、两参一改三结合的制度，以及劳动竞赛的新形式如大协作竞赛、技术表演赛等等，就是贯彻执行党的群众路线的结果。这一套办法、制度和形式，成了这些企业不断鼓舞群众干劲、集中群众智慧、解决生产关键、创造生产奇迹、改变企业面貌、开展技术革新和技术革命运动的有力保证。毛主席所亲手制订的党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套两条腿走路的方针，是党的群众路线的最高体现。贯彻执行了这条总路线和这一整套的方针，我们就能把各方面的积极因素都调动起来。因此，不论是工业还是农业，不论是重工业还是轻工业，不论是中央企业还是地方企业，也不论是大企业还是中小企业，也不论是利用洋法生产还是土法生产，由于同时并举和相互结合，这便大大发挥了各行各业广大职工的积极性和创造性，涌现了成千上万的先进集体和先进生产者，使群众路线大放异彩，国民经济面貌大大改观。
    毛泽东思想指导下的群众运动，是以辩证唯物主义的观点和方法作指导而不断发展的。党和毛泽东同志经常教导我们，必须从发展的观点而不是从静止的观点，从全面的观点而不是从片面的观点，从事物的本质方面而不是从事物表面现象去看问题。毛泽东同志告诉我们，必须观察事物内在的矛盾，并且根据矛盾的不同性质，提出不同的解决方法。我们在党的领导下根据毛泽东同志这一教导，在群众运动中，正确处理了一系列的矛盾，使运动能够迅速地发展。例如在处理政治和物质的关系上，实行了政治挂帅，而又不忽视物质鼓励的原则；在处理先进和落后的关系问题上，开展了比先进、赶先进、学先进、帮后进的劳动竞赛，运用了互相学习、互相帮助、取长补短、共同提高的原则；在对待困难问题上，体现了在战略上藐视困难，在战术上重视困难的精神；在改革企业规章制度问题上，做到了既有破，又有立，使集中领导和大搞群众运动结合起来；在群众生产运动的指导上，遵循了劳逸结合、波浪式向前发展的原则；在技术革新问题上，发扬了冲天的革命干劲和科学分析相结合的精神；在生产和生活的关系上，贯彻了既抓生产，又抓生活，在发展生产的基础上逐步改善生活的原则；等等。党的社会主义建设的总路线，就高度体现了毛泽东同志的辩证唯物主义的观点。这条总路线把高度发挥人民群众的主观能动性和高速度发展国民经济的客观可能性紧密结合起来了。这样就可以把各方面的积极性调动起来，并且把群众的劳动热情巩固下来，使工农业生产能够持续地保持跃进的速度。总之，先进企业的经验充分证明：以辩证唯物主义指导群众运动的结果，使各种矛盾得到正确的解决，从而出现了生动活泼、丰富多彩的群众运动的形式，出现了从来未有的精神振奋、斗志昂扬、意气风发的群众热情，出现了我国社会主义建设史无前例的繁荣兴旺的大好局面。
    毛泽东思想指导下的群众运动，已经开出了最美丽的花朵，结出了最丰硕的果实。过去，依据毛泽东思想指导群众运动，已经取得了大跃进的伟大胜利；今后，我们相信，只要坚持不渝地、更加自觉地掌握毛泽东思想，就一定会出现更加伟大的胜利。让我们通过学习群英大会的经验，更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗奋勇前进吧！
