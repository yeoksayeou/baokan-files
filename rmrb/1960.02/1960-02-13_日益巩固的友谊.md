    Increasingly Consolidated Friendship
    Lavrentyev, Vice President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Academician, Chairman of the Siberian Branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences

    Visiting the People's Republic of China is a major event in my life. I recently had the opportunity to lecture at Peking University for two weeks on issues related to mathematics and applied mechanics. I was very moved by the students' attentive expressions as they listened to the lectures. Their eyes revealed a thirst for knowledge… Indeed, in China, science is receiving the concern and attention of the people throughout the country.

    I feel fortunate to have been able to visit our friends during the grand celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Everywhere I went in China, I was deeply moved and delighted by the people's creative enthusiasm for construction. Six hundred million people are building a magnificent socialist edifice with high spirits.

    We and the great Chinese people share common paths and common tasks, which are also reflected in the development of scientific ties between our two countries. The creative friendship between Soviet and Chinese scientists is clearly manifested in the work of the Siberian Branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Scientists in Siberia and their Chinese friends are jointly studying land structures, organizing mineral exploration, and addressing the utilization of power resources in the Soviet-Chinese border region. For example, Yu. A. Kosygin, Director of the Institute of Geology and Geophysics of the Siberian Branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and Corresponding Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and Chinese Professor Zhang Wenyou are jointly studying the problem of mapping the earth's crust in China and the Soviet Union. Joint Sino-Soviet expert investigation teams are working in the Heilongjiang River basin and are formulating a grand plan to transform this resource-rich region for the benefit of the people of both countries.

    Important connections such as the exchange of scientific intelligence, literature, and close correspondence between scientists in various professional fields are expanding daily. Our scientists often go to China, and Chinese working people also often come here to participate in scientific conferences and exchange experiences. Academician A. A. Trofimuk, Corresponding Member A. V. Bichaze, and other scientists from Siberia have visited China recently. The friendly cooperation between the entire staff of the Far East Department of our branch and Chinese scientists has been very fruitful. Both sides are successfully conducting joint experiments in cultivating ginseng and studying its therapeutic properties.

    Many young Chinese university students and graduate students are studying at Soviet institutions of higher learning and academic institutions. Previously, you could only see them in Moscow and Leningrad, but now people in Novosibirsk are also receiving Chinese comrades in their homes.

    This year, Chinese and Siberian scientists will further expand their connections, and they will jointly study fourteen important academic issues.

    The friendly spirit of scientists from the two great countries is fully reflected in developing human knowledge and promoting greater new achievements in science in the great, invincible socialist countries.

    日益巩固的友谊
    苏联科学院副院长、院士、苏联科学院西伯利亚分院主席  拉夫连捷夫
    访问中华人民共和国在我一生中是一件大事。不久前我有机会在北京大学讲课两周，内容是关于数学和实用机械学方面的一些问题。学生们聚精会神地听课的神情使我很感动。他们的眼里流露出对知识的渴望……。的确，在中国科学是受到全国人民的关心和重视的。
    我感到很幸运，能够是在中华人民共和国成立十周年的伟大节日里到我们的朋友那里去。在中国，无论到那里，人们创造性的建设热情，到处使我非常感动和高兴。六亿人民正在意气风发地建设宏伟的社会主义大厦。
    我们和伟大的中国人民有着共同的道路和共同的任务，这些也反映在我们两国的科学联系的发展中，苏中科学家创作上的友谊明显地表现在苏联科学院西伯利亚分院的工作上。西伯利亚的科学家和中国朋友们共同研究土地结构、组织勘探矿藏，以及利用苏中边界地区的动力资源问题。例如苏联科学院西伯利亚分院的地质学和地球物理学研究所所长、苏联科学院通讯院士尤·阿·柯西金和中国教授张文佑等人共同研究绘制中苏两国地壳图的问题。中苏两国专家联合考察团正在黑龙江流域进行工作，并正在制订造福两国人民的、改造这个富源地区的宏伟方案。
    交换科学情报、文献以及各种专业技术科学家之间密切的信件往来等重要联系，正在日益扩大。我们的科学家常去中国，中国劳动人民也常来我们这里参加科学会议，互相交流经验。苏联科学院院士阿·阿·特罗菲木克、通讯院士阿·夫·比查则和西伯利亚的其他科学家在最近期间访问过中国。我们分院的远东部的全体工作人员和中国科学家们的友好合作是颇有成果的。双方在顺利地进行着栽培人参和研究人参的治疗性能方面的共同试验。
    很多中国青年大学生和研究生在苏联高等学校和学术机关学习。从前你只能在莫斯科和列宁格勒见到他们，现在新西伯利亚人也在自己的家里接待中国同志们了。
    今年中国和西伯利亚科学家将更加扩大联系，他们将共同研究十四个重要的学术问题。
    在发展人类的知识，促进伟大的、不可战胜的社会主义国家的科学获得更辉煌的新成就上，充分体现了两个伟大国家的科学家的友好精神。
