    A Journey to Guoluo
    Li Laiyu
    Traveling southwest by car from Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province, you can reach the Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in two days. Here, there is a new grassland city built on barren beaches, vast pastures with lush water and grass, fertile farmland, endless underground treasures, and precious wild plants and animals. Everyone who has been to Guoluo praises it, saying: Guoluo is a good place.
        The New Grassland City - Jimai
    Jimai is the political, economic, cultural, and transportation center of the Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, inhabited by approximately three thousand people of various ethnic groups. Before liberation, Jimai was a desolate grassy beach, with no households to be found within a twenty-mile radius. Only when winter arrived would some herdsmen drive their yaks here to spend the winter; in the spring, they would move their cattle and sheep to the spring pastures, leaving Jimai Beach empty. But now, it has become the most bustling place in the Guoluo area. In addition to the prefectural-level government offices, there are also shops, post offices, banks, grain stations, bookstores, hospitals, cinemas, bathhouses, and a national teachers' college for training ethnic teachers. People come and go on the streets, and Tibetan herdsmen enter and exit the supply and marketing cooperatives and department stores with joy, selling local products to the state and purchasing the goods they need.
    Jimai is changing rapidly! Although we only stayed in Jimai for a few months, we witnessed countless new things happening in Jimai during these months. Last September, when we were in Guoluo, we had to cross the Yellow River on a ferry to reach Jimai, but this year, when returning to Xining, we sped across the Jimai Yellow River Bridge in a car. The Jimai Yellow River Bridge is the first permanent reinforced concrete bridge on the upper reaches of the Yellow River and is also the largest highway bridge in Qinghai Province. The people of Jimai call this bridge the bridge of happiness.
    When we first arrived in Jimai, we could only write and read under candlelight at night. Thanks to the hard work of the power plant construction workers, who overcame numerous difficulties and quickly built and put the plant into operation, this grassland city was illuminated on National Day last year.
    The lively scene of the Jimai bathhouse opening for the first time touched us deeply. Tibetan herdsmen, who had never had the habit of bathing, now not only have the conditions to pay attention to hygiene in the era of communization but also have the opportunity to bathe in clean and comfortable bathhouses. Their joyous and excited expressions and the moving songs coming from the bathhouse are unforgettable.
    In the past, Tibetan herdsmen in the Guoluo area rarely saw industrial products. Today, Jimai has food processing plants, leather boot factories, iron factories, leather clothing processing factories, sewing factories, etc. These are all new developments that have emerged since March last year. We once visited the first food processing plant on the Guoluo grasslands. Although the factory currently has only simple buildings and a small number of employees, it has produced more than sixty kinds of products, including pastries, cakes, and soy sauce, since it was established in April last year, and it is very popular among the herdsmen. When they eat the pastries produced by the Jimai Food Processing Plant, they give a thumbs up and say in Tibetan: "Very good! Very good! This is the happiness brought to us by the Great Leap Forward."
        Good Pastures on the Upper Reaches of the Yellow River
    The Guoluo Grasslands on the upper reaches of the Yellow River are one of the best natural pastures in Qinghai Province. Even in the depths of winter, if you travel to the Guoluo Grasslands, you will be attracted by the scenery here. When "thousands of miles are frozen, and ten thousand miles are covered with snow," groups of strong yaks and flocks of snow-white sheep, accompanied by the herdsmen's bold songs, paint a vibrant picture of the winter pastures.
    The Guoluo Prefecture covers an area of more than 140,000 square kilometers, and the usable grassland accounts for about 70%, which is such a good natural condition for developing the animal husbandry economy! Speaking of pasture, in many places, you can see the magnificent scenery of "the wind blows the grass low to reveal cattle and sheep." The lush pasture, which is more than two feet high, accounts for about 20% of the prefecture's pastures. These pastures generally begin to grow in March in the spring and turn yellow by the end of September, allowing livestock to graze on green grass for seven months each year.
    The Guoluo Grasslands are also extremely rich in water resources. In addition to the Yellow River traversing the area from west to east, there are also rivers with large flows, such as the Duo Ke River, Ma Ke River, Dari River, and Jimai River, as well as countless springs and gullies. All of these create extremely favorable conditions for the development of animal husbandry production.
    Although the Guoluo Grasslands are still under the shroud of severe cold in February, the hearts of the vast Tibetan herdsmen on the grasslands are fiery. They are facing a golden harvest season. The joy of a bountiful winter lamb crop permeates the grasslands, and good news flies to the office of the Prefectural Party Secretary like snowflakes. Everything shows that the Guoluo Grasslands are striding forward in animal husbandry production. By early February, the prefecture had produced 105,681 lambs, with 101,964 surviving, a survival rate of 96.4%, achieving an unprecedented harvest in history. How excited people are during the harvest days! Because all localities resolutely implemented the policy of "taking robustness as the key link" last year, and launched a vigorous blitz to gain weight in the summer and autumn, more than 95% of the prefecture's livestock reached first-class fatness when they entered the winter pastures. At the same time, scientific methods such as "artificial estrus induction" and "heat breeding" were promoted, and many cases of multiple births occurred in various places this year. A total of 161 ewes in the prefecture have produced twin lambs, all of which are fully alive and strong. Three ewes in the Songdu Commune of Tongde County gave birth to nine lambs, all of which survived.
    Another feature of this year's bumper lamb harvest in Guoluo is that the lambs produced are heavier than ordinary lambs in the past. Recently, the fourth production team of the Tangqian Gou Commune in Dari County produced two lambs, one weighing 15 catties and 11 taels and the other weighing 13 catties and 2 taels at birth. The old herdsman Banzang of this commune told everyone he met: "I have lived for more than forty years and have never seen such big lambs. The largest newborn lamb in Guoluo's history only weighed 12 catties. The People's Commune is really good!"
        Be Careful Not to Trip Over Minerals Everywhere
    "Guoluo is a treasure trove, with more minerals than yak hair; from the grasslands to the hillsides, be careful not to trip over minerals everywhere." This is a widely circulated folk song on the Guoluo Grasslands. It shows that the lovely Guoluo is not only a very good natural pasture with fertile land, suitable for animal husbandry and agriculture, but also a place with extremely rich underground mineral resources, with great prospects for industrial development. Before entering Guoluo, we were always attracted by the petroleum of Qaidam and yearned for the mineral deposits of the Qilian Mountains. In fact, this was an overly narrow understanding of the extremely rich underground resources of Qinghai. After we came to Guoluo, we realized that the past understanding was one-sided. Not only do the Qilian Mountains and Qaidam areas have extremely rich underground resources, but the mineral deposits on the Guoluo Grasslands are also extremely rich.
    In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, geological exploration personnel have closely combined with the local masses and launched a mass movement to report and find minerals. Although only a small part of the area has been surveyed, eighteen minerals, including iron, coal, lead, zinc, mica, asbestos, gold, silver, and magnesium, have been discovered, totaling more than fifty mineral sites. Among them, many minerals are of good quality, large reserves, and have great mining value.
    The rich underground resources have created extremely favorable conditions for the industrial development of the Guoluo area. Although the industry here is still in its infancy, the total industrial output value last year exceeded the original plan by 165.5%. Local Tibetan herdsmen, who had never seen industrial products in the past, have now mastered machines under the cultivation of the state and the help of fraternal ethnic groups, working diligently to build a happy grassland. At the end of 1959, the number of employees in the prefecture on the industrial front had increased to more than 8,000, which is more than two and a half times the total number of employees in 1958. More than ten new modern industrial and mining enterprises have been built in the prefecture, including the Dawu Coal Mine, Maqin Milk Powder Factory, Dawu Chemical Factory, Dawu Sulfuric Acid Factory, and Jimai Hydropower Station.
    In terms of daily necessities, more than 400 kinds of products such as various pastries, candies, and dried meat can now be produced locally. At the same time, more than ten handicraft production enterprises have been established to produce leather clothing, leather hides, boots, and wooden utensils, thus meeting the needs of people's lives.

    果洛纪行
    李来予
    从青海省会西宁坐汽车往西南行，两天便可以到达果洛藏族自治州。这里有在荒滩上建设起的草原新城，有水草丰美的辽阔牧场，有肥沃的农田，有无尽的地下宝藏，还有珍贵的野生植物与野生动物。凡是到过果洛的人，都称赞说：果洛是个好地方。
        草原新城——吉迈
    吉迈是果洛藏族自治州政治、经济、文化和交通的中心，这里居住着三千左右的各族人民。解放前的吉迈是一片十分荒凉的草滩，方圆二十里路找不到一户人家，只有当冬季到来的时候，才有一些牧民赶着牦牛来到这儿过冬；到了春天，他们又赶着牛羊搬到春季草场去了，留下空空的吉迈滩。可是现在，这里已经成为果洛地区最热闹的地方了，除了州级机关以外，还有商店、邮局、银行、粮站、书店、医院、电影院、浴池和一所培养民族师资的民族师范学校。街道上人群来来往往，藏族牧民满怀喜悦地出入于供销社和百货商店，把土特产品卖给国家，购买他们所需的物品。
    现在的吉迈正在一日千里地变化着！我们在吉迈虽然只停留了几个月，但是在这几个月中却亲眼看到吉迈发生了数不清的新鲜事情。去年9月，我们在果洛时，还是在渡船上涉渡黄河来到吉迈的，可是今年回西宁时，却是坐在汽车上飞快地驶过了吉迈黄河大桥。吉迈黄河大桥是黄河上游第一座永久式钢筋混凝土大桥，也是青海省目前最大的公路桥。吉迈人民把这座桥称为幸福的桥梁。
    我们刚刚来吉迈的时候，晚上只能在蜡烛下面写字看书，由于修建电厂的职工发挥了冲天干劲，克服重重困难，快速建厂和投入生产，在去年国庆节时这座草原城市就大放了光明。
    吉迈浴池第一次营业的生动情景，使我们非常感动。从来没有洗澡习惯的藏族牧民在公社化的今天，不仅有了讲究卫生的条件，而且有机会在清洁舒适的浴池洗澡了。他们那股喜上眉梢的欢乐劲儿，那从浴池里传出来的动人的歌声，使我们久久不能忘怀。
    过去，果洛地区的藏族牧民，连工业品也很难见到。今天，在吉迈却出现了食品加工厂、皮靴生产厂、铁工厂、皮衣加工厂、缝纫厂等。这些都是在去年3月以后才出现的新事情。我们曾经参观了果洛草原上的第一个食品加工厂，这个工厂虽然目前还只有简陋的厂房和不多的职工，但是从去年4月建厂以来，已经生产了点心、蛋糕、酱油等六十多种产品，深受牧民的欢迎。他们吃着吉迈食品加工厂生产的点心时，翘着大拇指用藏语说：“很好！很好！这是大跃进给我们带来的幸福。”
        黄河上游好牧场
    黄河上游的果洛草原是青海省最好的天然牧场之一。即使在数九隆冬，如果你来到果洛草原上旅行一趟，也会为这里的景色所吸引。在“千里冰封，万里雪飘”的时候，一群群健壮的牦牛，一群群雪白的绵羊，伴着牧人豪迈的歌声，绘出一片冬季牧场生气勃勃的图景。
    果洛全州面积达十四万多平方公里，可以利用的草原竟达70％左右，这是多么好的发展畜牧业经济的天然条件啊！说到牧草，很多地方都可以看到“风吹草低见牛羊”的壮丽景色，高达二尺以上的丰美牧草，占全州牧场20％左右。这些牧草一般在春季3月开始生长，至9月底方枯黄，牲畜每年可吃到七个月的青草。
    果洛草原水源也极为丰富，境内除了有黄河自西向东横贯其中以外，还有多可河、马可河、达日河、吉迈河等流量很大的河流，以及无数的泉水和山沟，所有这些都为发展畜牧业生产创造了极其有利的条件。
    2月的果洛草原虽然还在严寒的笼罩下，可是草原上广大藏族牧民的心情却是火热的。他们正面临着一个金色的丰收季节。冬羔丰收的喜悦在草原上到处弥漫着，捷报像雪片似地飞到州委书记的办公室里，一切都说明果洛草原在畜牧业生产上正在昂首阔步前进。到2月上旬，全州已产羔十万五千六百八十一只，成活十万一千九百六十四只，成活率为96．4％，获得了历史上空前的丰收。在丰收的日子里，人们的心情是多么兴奋啊！由于去年各地坚决执行了“以壮为纲”的方针，在夏秋两季狠狠地突击抓膘，全州牲畜在进入冬季牧场时，一等膘达到95％以上；同时推行了“人工催情”“热胎配种”等科学方法，今年各地都出现了不少一胎多羔的事例，全州已有一百六十一只母羊产双羔，并且全活全壮。同德县松都公社三只母羊产羔九只，也全部成活。
    今年果洛羔羊丰收还有一个特点，就是所产羔羊比过去一般的羔羊都重。最近达日县唐欠沟公社第四生产队产了两只羔羊，刚生下时一只重十五斤十一两，一只重十三斤二两，这个公社的老放牧员班藏见人就说：“我活了四十多岁，从没有见过这么大的羔羊，果洛历史上最大的初生羔羊只有十二斤，人民公社真是好啊！”
        处处当心矿碰脚
    “果洛是个宝贝窝，矿藏还比牛毛多；从草原，到山坡，处处当心矿碰脚。”这是果洛草原上流传很广的一首民歌，它说明：可爱的果洛不仅是一个很好的天然牧场，有肥沃的土地，宜牧、宜农，而且也是一个地下矿藏极其丰富的地方，发展工业有远大前途。未进果洛以前，我们总是常常为柴达木的石油所吸引，向往着祁连山的矿藏。这实际上是把青海地下资源极为丰富的这个概念理解得太狭隘了。当我们来到果洛以后，才发觉过去的理解是片面的。不仅祁连山、柴达木等地有极丰富的地下资源，就是果洛草原上的矿藏也极其丰富。
    几年来，特别是大跃进的1958年以来，地质勘探人员和当地群众密切结合，掀起了群众性的报矿找矿运动，虽然还只踏查过很少一部分地区，就已发现有铁、煤、铅、锌、云母、石棉、金、银、镁等十八个矿种，计五十多个矿点，其中有许多矿藏，都是品质好、储量大，具有极大开采价值的矿藏。
    丰富的地下资源，为果洛地区的工业发展创造了极为有利的条件。虽然这里的工业还刚刚萌芽，去年工业总产值就超过了原计划的165．5％。过去连工业品也没见过的当地藏族牧民，今天在国家的培养和兄弟民族的帮助下，有的已经亲手掌握了机器，为建设幸福的草原而辛勤地劳动着。1959年底，全州在工业战线上的职工已增加到八千余人，相当于1958年职工总数的两倍半还多。全州新建的现代化工矿企业有大武煤矿、玛沁奶粉厂、大武化工厂、大武硫酸厂、吉迈水电站等十多个。
    在生活用品方面，现在已能就地生产各种糕点、糖果、肉松、肉干等四百多种产品；同时还建立了制皮衣、制皮张、制靴和木器用具等十余个手工业生产企业，因而满足了人民生活上的需要。（附图片）
