Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 8th February: Fujian's tea-producing areas are strengthening tea garden management in an effort to achieve a bumper spring tea harvest.

Since last winter, people's communes in the sixteen major tea-producing counties of Fujian Province have organized specialized tea garden management teams to carry out meticulous management. As a result, tea garden management work has been better than in any previous year. According to incomplete statistics, the area of tea gardens cultivated throughout the province accounts for 59.4% of the total area of tea gardens, and the area that has been top-dressed with fertilizer accounts for 40.7%. At the same time, tea areas have also reclaimed and newly opened up a batch of tea gardens. The province has currently expanded tea gardens by more than 150,000 mu.
