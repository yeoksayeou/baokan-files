According to the "Anshan Daily," Su Baocheng, a Communist Party member, model worker of Anshan City, and technical innovation pioneer of the Third Work Zone of the Anshan City Construction Engineering Company, recently manufactured ten machines in just over sixty days, increasing work efficiency by ten to one hundred and twenty times. This completely changed the backward state of the plastering team, replacing the old trowels and mud boards with machines, thus mechanizing plastering work.

In 1959, Su Baocheng attended the National Conference of Heroes and Model Workers. Upon returning to the company, he went straight to the Party branch office of the work zone and proposed an innovative suggestion to fully mechanize all plastering operations. In just over sixty days, under the leadership of the Party branch and with the help of the workers, he manufactured ten machines, including a plastering machine, spraying machine, hemp-beating machine, polishing machine, sand screening machine, and magnetic tile drilling machine.

In the ten machines that Su Baocheng manufactured this time, flywheels alone required more than thirty, all of which were collected in his "treasure trove" in the past. When other parts were not enough, he went to the scrap iron pile in the warehouse to find them or sought help from fraternal units. In this way, he made ten machines simply and thriftily.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi. Shi Jian, a young fitter at the Dushanzi Mining Area Machinery Factory of the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration, created a die tool to punch bearing retaining rings for automobile trailers, increasing efficiency by 1,500 times. On January 24, he completed the work that used to take 6,000 hours in just four hours.

Manufacturing retaining rings used to require five processes: forging, turning, planing, milling, and fitting, taking twenty hours to process one. Shi Jian, a member of the Communist Youth League, suggested trial-producing a punch die and using the factory's existing punch press for processing. His suggestion was immediately supported by the factory leadership, and many fitters, planers, and electricians enthusiastically helped him design and draw the punch die drawings. Technical cadres also helped him modify the design many times to grasp the range of thermal expansion and contraction of the steel plate. After ten days of hard work, Shi Jian's suggestion was finally successfully tested.

### 老英雄新英雄齐争上游  革新闯将苏宝成六十多天制成十台建筑机械  青工石坚改进制造轴承挡圈技术提高工效1500倍

    革新闯将苏宝成六十多天制成十台建筑机械
    青工石坚改进制造轴承挡圈技术提高工效1500倍
    据鞍山日报消息　鞍山市建筑工程公司三工区共产党员、市劳动模范、技术革新闯将苏宝成最近在六十多天中制造了十台机器，提高工作效率十倍到一百二十倍。使抹灰队彻底地改变落后面貌，用机器代替了陈旧的抹子和泥板，使抹灰工作机械化了。
    1959年，苏宝成出席了全国群英会，回到公司就直奔工区党支部办公室，提出了抹灰全部操作机械化的革新建议。仅六十几天，他就在党支部的领导和工人们的协助下，制造出抹灰机、喷灰机、打麻刀机、压光机、筛砂机、磁砖钻眼机等十台机器。
    苏宝成这次制造的十台机器中，仅飞轮就用了三十多个，这都是过去收集在他的“万宝库”里的东西。其他零件不够时，就到仓库废铁堆里去找或到兄弟单位求援。他就这样因陋就简地制作了十台机器。
  据新华社乌鲁木齐电　新疆石油管理局独山子矿区机械厂青年钳工石坚，创造了胎模工具冲制汽车拖车上用的轴承挡圈，提高工效一千五百倍，在1月24日，只用四个小时就做完了过去需要六千个小时的活。
    制造挡圈过去要经过锻、车、刨、铣、钳五道工序，加工一个就要二十个小时。共青团员石坚建议试制冲模，利用厂里现有的冲床来加工。他的这一建议立即得到工厂领导的支持，许多钳工、刨工、电工都热情地帮助他设计和绘制冲模图纸，技术干部也多次帮助他修改设计，掌握钢板热胀冷缩的幅度。经过十天的苦战，石坚的建议终于试验成功。
