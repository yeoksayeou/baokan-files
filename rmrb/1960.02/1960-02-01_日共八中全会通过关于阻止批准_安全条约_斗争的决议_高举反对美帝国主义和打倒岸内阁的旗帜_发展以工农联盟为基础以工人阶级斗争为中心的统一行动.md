Xinhua News Agency, 29th dispatch: According to TASS, Tokyo, 28th dispatch: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party held its Eighth Enlarged Plenary Session. The meeting discussed reports on the struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and on the development of the Party, and unanimously adopted a resolution on these issues.
    The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party published on the 28th a report on this enlarged plenary session of the Central Committee, which began on the 22nd and ended on the 26th.
    Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch: Tokyo News: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party published in "Akahata" on the 30th the resolution passed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Japanese Communist Party on the struggle to prevent the ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."
    The Eighth Plenary Session of the Japanese Communist Party began on January 22 and ended on January 26.
    The resolution pointed out that the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is essentially an aggressive Japan-U.S. military alliance. Due to the signing of this treaty, Japan remains in a state of semi-occupation by the United States, and U.S. imperialism wants to use Japan to promote its dangerous policies of war and aggression against Asia; on the other hand, Japan's traitorous monopoly capital is attempting to take the opportunity to openly revive militarism and adopt a policy of imperialist expansion abroad while being subordinate to the United States. The resolution pointed out that the new "Security Treaty" is also a weapon for the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to suppress the Japanese people.
    The resolution said that the establishment of a new U.S.-Japan military alliance has been strongly condemned by the people of socialist countries and Asian countries, as well as the people of countries around the world who demand peaceful coexistence. As a result, Japan is further isolated and will fall into an even more difficult situation.
    The resolution pointed out that within Japan, the public opinion condemning the revision of the "Security Treaty" is rising, and the anxiety and dissatisfaction among all classes of the Japanese people regarding the future of Japan are deepening. Within the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party, the conflict of opinions on the issue of Japan-China relations is also gradually surfacing. The path taken by the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet of strengthening the U.S.-Japan military alliance, promoting "U.S.-Japan economic cooperation," reviving militarism and imperialism, has aroused deep contradictions between the ruling forces and the people of all classes.
    The resolution pointed out that "U.S.-Japan economic cooperation" under the circumstances of signing the new "Security Treaty" will, on the one hand, promote the strengthening of U.S. monopoly capital's control over Japanese industry, and on the other hand, indicate that Japanese monopoly capital is using the United States to move towards the revival of imperialism. All of this will not only deepen the suffering of the Japanese people's lives but also intensify the conditions for creating a crisis of overproduction.
    The resolution emphasized that the signing of the new "Security Treaty" by the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the Japanese reactionaries has brought a serious situation to Japan, but it has promoted their isolation among the people and created conditions for the broad masses of people to strive for peace, independence, democracy, neutrality, and improved living standards, as well as to strengthen unity.
    The Japanese Communist Party emphasized that struggling to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" is our urgent task at present. The Party must adhere to the basic direction pointed out by the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session, and resolutely launch a struggle with the goal of preventing ratification and striving for the abolition of the "Security Treaty" and shattering the San Francisco system. This struggle must be promoted simultaneously as a struggle to establish a national democratic united front. The resolution said that in the struggle, we must demand the dissolution of the Diet, strengthen the struggle against U.S. imperialism, and raise the banner of overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.
    The resolution pointed out that in the course of the struggle, it is necessary to clarify the necessity of abolishing the "Security Treaty" and at the same time combine the current struggles with the struggle to abolish the "Security Treaty."
    The resolution said that while opposing the new "Security Treaty," it is necessary to oppose Japan's nuclear armament, mobilize strong public opinion in support of complete disarmament; rapidly strengthen the people's movement to restore Japan-China diplomatic relations and conclude a Japan-Soviet peace treaty; strengthen the movement to demand the return of Okinawa and Ogasawara to Japan, to demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Japan and the abolition of U.S. military bases; oppose the destruction of democratic rights, defend the Constitution, thwart the conspiracy to maliciously revise the Constitution, and demand the full implementation of the peace and democratic provisions of the Constitution. At the same time, it is necessary to clarify to the broad masses of people that only by demanding Japan's neutralization is the path to Japan's peace, security, and independence.
    The resolution also said that the Party must promote the workers' struggle to safeguard basic rights and democracy, the peasants' struggle centered on raising rice purchase prices, the citizens' struggle to demand tax cuts, and the people's struggle to demand thorough cuts in military spending and oppose this year's budget. At the same time, these struggles must be correctly combined with the unified struggle to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."
    The resolution emphasized that in the mass struggle, it is currently necessary to strengthen the united front of the working class and develop unified action based on the worker-peasant alliance and centered on the working-class struggle.
    The Japanese Communist Party pointed out in the resolution the tasks facing the Party and democratic forces in the struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" and further abolish the "Security Treaty." The resolution said that the primary task is to intensify propaganda activities in order to launch an anti-"Security Treaty" movement in workshops and regions where struggles have not yet been organized. Doubled efforts should be made to organize peasants in the anti-"Security Treaty" movement. The second task is to express the people's various economic and political demands, so that people with various demands gather around the movement against the revision of the "Security Treaty," and develop the current National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" into a permanent organization capable of this task.
    The third task is that the Party should try to establish the leadership of the working class in the movement against the "Security Treaty."
    The fourth task is to strengthen the leadership role of the National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and the various organizations belonging to the National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" should strengthen unity and cooperation.
    The resolution also pointed out that it is necessary to resolutely struggle against right-wing sabotage activities as well as "left"-leaning adventurism and Trotskyist provocative actions, and maintain the policy of establishing a united front.
    The resolution also especially emphasized developing the signature campaign against the "Security Treaty" into a nationwide movement.
    The resolution pointed out that the Party should fight for the dissolution of the Diet and prepare for the general election.
    Resolution said that the Eighth Central Committee Session unanimously confirmed that the strategy adopted by the Party based on the Sixth Central Committee Session's resolution was completely correct.
    The resolution emphasized that in the current historic people's struggle, the Party should focus on strengthening Party unity and expanding the number of Party members. The resolution pointed out that a strong Communist Party will be the only reliable guarantee to unite all the Japanese people under a strong national democratic united front.

    日共八中全会通过关于阻止批准“安全条约”斗争的决议
    高举反对美帝国主义和打倒岸内阁的旗帜
    发展以工农联盟为基础以工人阶级斗争为中心的统一行动
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社东京28日讯：日本共产党中央委员会举行了第八次扩大会议。会议讨论了关于反对日美“安全条约”的斗争和关于党的发展的报告，并且就这些问题一致通过了一项决议。
    日本共产党中央委员会书记局在28日发表了从22日开始到26日结束的这次中央扩大全会的报告。
    新华社31日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会30日在“赤旗报”上公布了日共八中全会通过的关于阻止批准新日美“安全条约”的斗争的决议。
    日共八中全会是在1月22日开始到26日结束的。
    决议指出，新日美“安全条约”实质上是一个侵略性日美军事同盟。由于签订了这个条约，日本仍然被置于美国的半占领状态中，美帝国主义并且想利用日本来推行它对亚洲的危险的战争和侵略政策；另一方面，日本卖国垄断资本企图趁机公然复活军国主义，并在从属于美国的情况下采取对外进行帝国主义扩张的政策。决议指出，新“安全条约”也是美日反动派镇压日本人民的武器。
    决议说，日美建立新军事同盟受到社会主义各国和亚洲各国人民以及要求和平共处的世界各国人民强烈的谴责。因而，日本进一步孤立，并且将陷于更加困难的处境。
    决议指出，在日本国内谴责修改“安全条约”的舆论越来越高涨，围绕着日本的前途问题，日本各阶层人民间的不安与不满正在日益加深。在岸信介内阁和自由民主党内部，对于日中关系问题的意见的对立也逐渐表面化。岸信介内阁所走的加强日美军事同盟、推进“日美经济合作”、复活军国主义和帝国主义的这条道路，激起了统治势力与人民各阶层之间的深刻的矛盾。
    决议指出，在签订新“安全条约”情况下的“日美经济合作”，一方面将促进美国垄断资本加强对日本产业的控制，另一方面表示着日本垄断资本利用美国走向复活帝国主义的方向，这一切不仅将加深日本人民生活的痛苦，而且将加紧制造生产过剩危机的条件。
    决议强调指出，岸信介内阁和日本反动派签订新“安全条约”，给日本带来了严重的形势，但是这促进了它们在人民中的孤立，产生了广大人民为争取和平、独立、民主、中立和提高生活水平以及加强团结的条件。
    日共强调指出，为阻止批准新“安全条约”而斗争，这是我们目前迫切的任务，党必须坚持六中全会的决议所指明的基本方向，以阻止批准和争取废除“安全条约”以及粉碎旧金山体系为目标，坚决展开斗争。这项斗争必须同时作为争取建立民族民主统一战线的斗争而加以推进。决议说，在斗争中我们必须要求解散国会，加强反对美帝国主义的斗争，高举打倒岸信介内阁的旗帜。
    决议指出，在斗争的过程中必须阐明废除“安全条约”的必要性，同时把当前的各项斗争同争取废除“安全条约”的斗争结合起来。
    决议说，必须在反对新“安全条约”的同时，反对日本核武装，动员支持全面裁军的强大舆论；迅速加强展开争取恢复日中邦交和缔结日苏和约的人民运动；加强要求把冲绳和小笠原还给日本、要求美军撤出日本和撤销美军基地的运动；反对破坏民主权利，维护宪法，粉碎恶劣修改宪法的阴谋，要求完全实施宪法中关于和平和民主的条款。同时要向广大人民阐明，只有要求日本中立化才是日本的和平、安全、独立的道路。
    决议还说，党必须促进工人维护基本权利和民主的斗争，以提高大米收购价格为中心的农民的斗争，要求削减税金的市民的斗争，要求彻底削减军事开支、反对本年度预算的人民的斗争。同时把这些斗争同阻止批准新“安全条约”的统一斗争正确地结合起来。
    决议强调指出，在群众斗争中，目前必须加强工人阶级的统一战线，并且发展以工农联盟为基础、以工人阶级斗争为中心的统一行动。
    日共在决议中指出了党和民主力量在阻止修改“安全条约”和进一步废除“安全条约”的斗争中所面临的任务。决议说，首要的任务是，加紧宣传活动，以便在尚未组织斗争的车间和地区开展反对“安全条约”运动。应该加倍努力把农民组织在反对“安全条约”的运动中。第二个任务是，表达人民的各种经济要求和政治要求，从而使有着各种要求的人们集合在反对修改“安全条约”的运动的周围，把现在的阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议发展成为胜任这项任务的永久性组织。
    第三个任务是，党应该设法在反对“安全条约”的运动中建立工人阶级的领导权。
    第四个任务是加强阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议的领导作用，属于阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议的各个组织应该加强团结合作。
    决议还指出应该同右翼的破坏活动以及“左”倾冒险主义和托派挑衅性行动坚决斗争，维护建立统一战线的政策。
    决议还特别强调把反对“安全条约”的签名运动发展为全民性运动。
    决议指出，党应该为解散国会和准备大选而斗争。
    决议说，中央委员会第八次会议一致确认，党根据中央委员会第六次会议的决议采取的策略是完全正确的。
    决议强调说，在当前的历史性的人民斗争中，党应该着重加强党的团结和扩大党员人数的工作。决议指出，强大的共产党将是把全体日本人民集合在强有力的全国民主统一阵线之下的唯一可靠的保证。
