    Settling in Poor Teams to Help Them Become Prosperous
    In January of this year, the Finance and Banking departments of Hengnan County, Hunan Province, dispatched sixty-three cadres to reside in sixty-three poor teams, implementing the "Three Togethers": eating together, living together, and laboring together. They enthusiastically helped the poor teams formulate plans for developing production, issue agricultural loans, organize the rational use of production funds, arrange labor power, and open up avenues for production. Li Shengquan, director of the People's Bank of Tanzi Mountain Commune's business office, went to Zhengqing Brigade, the poorest in the commune, and helped formulate this year's production development plan, setting up five factories for farm tools, pesticides, fertilizers, etc., which greatly boosted the members' confidence in changing the face of the poor team, and the members' enthusiasm for spring plowing and production became even greater. Ouyang Dun, a bank cadre from Guanyin Commune, after being assigned to Jintai Brigade, studied the production situation of the poor team with the general branch secretary Hu Biao, etc., and increased more than twenty production projects such as pig raising and fish farming, helped establish two large pig farms, and planned to raise 1,500 pigs, with income expected to double compared to last year. The poorer Pingshan, Bashi, and Doushan Brigades of Maodongqiao Commune, under the key support of the finance department, have made preparations for spring plowing and production in terms of seeds, fertilizers, farm tools, plowing cattle, and production funds.
    Last year, the Finance and Banking departments of Hengnan County conducted a survey of the economic situation of 108 poor teams in the county, and then, according to the size of the difficulties and production needs, prioritized the issuance of 170,000 yuan of interest-free loans and more than 740,000 yuan of agricultural loans. At the same time, they sent cadres to reside in the poor teams to help them make careful calculations and use production funds rationally, so as to do more with less money, helping many poor teams catch up with the rich teams. Some production teams in Gucheng Brigade of Quanxi Commune had low crop yields and relatively poor living conditions due to poor soil quality and lack of fertilizer. After bank cadres learned about this situation, they decided to prioritize loans to establish pig farms, mills, and purchase piglets for breeding, promoting bumper grain harvests, and increasing the income of these production teams last year by two times compared to 1958. Based on last year's experience, the Finance and Banking departments of Hengnan County have also formulated this year's plan to help poor teams develop production.

    到穷队落户　帮穷队变富
    今年1月份，湖南省衡南县财政金融部门派出了六十三个干部，分别到六十三个穷队住下来，实行“三同”，同吃同住同劳动。热情地帮助穷队制订发展生产的规划，发放农业贷款，组织生产资金合理使用，安排好劳力，开辟生产门路。谭子山公社人民银行营业所主任李盛权到这个社最穷的正清大队，帮助制订今年发展生产的规划，办好农具、农药、化肥等五个工厂，大大鼓舞了社员们改变穷队面貌的信心，社员们春耕生产的劲头更足。观音公社银行干部欧阳暾分到金台大队后，同总支书记胡彪等一道研究了这个大队的穷队生产情况，增加了养猪、养鱼等二十多种生产项目，帮助建立两个大猪场，计划养猪一千五百头，收入可比去年增加一倍。茅洞桥公社较穷的坪山、八石、斗山等大队，在财政部门的重点扶持下，已从种子、肥料、农具、耕牛以及生产资金等各方面，作好了春耕生产的准备工作。
    去年，衡南县财政金融部门对全县一百零八个穷队的经济情况作了调查，然后根据困难大小和生产需要，优先发放了十七万元无息贷款和七十四万多元农业贷款，同时派干部住到穷队，帮助它们精打细算，合理使用生产资金，做到少用钱多办事，帮助许多穷队赶上了富队。泉溪公社古城大队有的生产队因为土质差，缺肥料，农作物产量不高，生活比较贫困。银行干部了解这一情况后，决定优先贷款，建立猪场、磨房、买小猪饲养，促进了粮食丰产，使这些生产队去年的收入比1958年增加了两倍。衡南县财政金融部门根据去年的经验，又拟订了今年帮助穷队发展生产的计划。（据新华社讯）
