Jinan, February 15th (By our own correspondent) – Shandong's water conservancy construction has achieved brilliant results. The province's mountains and rivers have taken on a new look, and a large number of newly built projects have begun to be used for spring irrigation. At the outlet of the Weishan Irrigation Area of the Weishan Hub Project on the Yellow River, one hundred flows were released, allowing many rivers and reservoirs in the Liaocheng area to be filled with water, irrigating more than 4 million mu of farmland. In the mountainous Wu Lian County, more than 2,000 water conservancy projects built during the winter have already put more than 1,000 into irrigation. Reservoirs have been opened, rivers are flowing, and gullies are being dammed, bringing mountain water down, raising river water up, and increasing the daily irrigation progress to more than 50,000 mu. The area of ​​winter-irrigated land throughout the province has reached approximately 20 million mu.

Since October of last year, 9 million people in Shandong Province have participated in the water conservancy construction movement. As of January 25 this year, 44 large and medium-sized projects have been completed ahead of schedule, along with tens of thousands of small reservoirs, ponds, and water storage pools, 8,132 diversions of rivers and springs, 11,767 wells dug (including 2,329 mechanized wells), more than 20,000 improved wells, 367,594 new and repaired irrigation canals at all levels, stretching more than 440,000 li in length, and 20,245 various buildings constructed, totaling 3 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work, accounting for 75% of the annual task. These projects can expand the irrigated area by 15.23 million mu, improve the irrigated area by 9.51 million mu, and, together with the original irrigated area, reach 86.91 million mu. With a total agricultural population of 50 million in the province, each person has an average of 1.73 mu of irrigated land. The area of ​​soil erosion controlled in mountainous areas has reached more than 36,000 square kilometers (an increase of more than 5,000 square kilometers), accounting for more than 72% of the total soil erosion area in the province. The area of ​​waterlogged and low-lying land that has been treated and improved accounts for 86% of the total waterlogged area in the province.

This high-speed water conservancy construction progress once again demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes. Relying on the powerful manpower, material resources, and financial resources of the people's communes, a new situation of unified planning and comprehensive management emerged from the very beginning of water conservancy construction last winter. Generally, from the source of the river to the end, from the top of the mountain to the foot, from the river itself to the fields, large, medium, and small sizes are organically combined, water, fertilizer, soil, and forests are organically combined, and sky, underground, and river water are organically combined, grasping one item and completing it in one go, making various projects a complete system. Like the Weishan Hub project, on the one hand, 200,000 people were concentrated on building water diversion, water storage, and interception projects, and on the other hand, hundreds of thousands of people were organized to carry out a concentrated effort to build field irrigation projects. Now, in the Weishan large irrigation area of ​​more than 10 million mu, more than 6 million mu have realized large-scale gardening of fields, systematization of canal systems, and standardization of road and forest specifications. In the management of the seven major rivers, including the Yi, Shu, Wen, and Si rivers, systematic management has also begun from the ground up. The Linyi area adopted a management method combining mountains, water, forests, and fields in the Yi and Shu River basins, namely "pinching the dragon's neck, locking the eighteen claws (tributaries), and dredging the ten thousand roots of beard (small mountain gullies)," which turned many mountain ridges in the vast mountainous areas into flat farmland, and many rugged paths into open and bright avenues, and the natural landscape has been completely renewed.

At the same time, in the large-scale water conservancy movement, the people's communes in Shandong have adhered to the principles of self-reliance, local material collection, indigenous methods, and a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results. All the materials needed for the 356 large and small buildings that have been built and the 14 hydroelectric power stations under construction by the people's communes in Cao County have been solved by themselves. The 255 large and medium-sized projects started in the province this winter and spring are 4.2 times more than the total completed in the past ten years. Among these huge projects, 193 were mainly undertaken by the communes.

The winter-spring water conservancy construction movement has further proved the importance of putting politics in command. The Party committees at all levels are led by the first secretaries, leading thousands of capable cadres deep into the construction sites to eat, live, and labor with the migrant workers. They also established secretary reservoirs, secretary canals, water conservancy experimental fields, etc., to give specific instructions. At the same time, a large number of construction site Party schools, construction site Communist Youth League schools, construction site cultural schools, construction site technical schools, and other schools were generally set up on the construction sites, and in-depth and systematic socialist education was carried out, making the water conservancy construction site a communist blast furnace, both building water conservancy and training people. Therefore, the vast number of migrant workers are in high spirits and full of energy, launching a competition boom for exceeding quotas and achieving high work efficiency everywhere. At present, the average daily work efficiency in the province has reached 7.5 cubic meters. More than one million model pacesetters have emerged, creating, imitating, and promoting more than 70 kinds of advanced construction tools, totaling more than 5.26 million pieces. Many large and medium-sized water conservancy construction sites have achieved semi-mechanization and partial mechanization in the five processes of digging, loading, transporting, unloading, and ramming. The factories and groups set up at the construction sites totaled 73,700, and 8,330 kilometers of various simple iron and wood tracks were laid.

Now, the water conservancy army at the water conservancy construction sites in Shandong, in addition to a part that has been transferred to spring plowing production, the rest are divided into three groups to seize the favorable opportunity before sowing to continue to concentrate efforts. One group is focusing on field canal projects to prepare for spring irrigation, another group is focusing on the finishing work of basically completed projects and small-scale farmland water conservancy, and the third group is continuing to carry out large and medium-sized water conservancy construction, striving to overfulfill the annual water conservancy construction tasks before spring sowing to ensure benefits in the current year.

    依靠公社强大威力　水利建设多快好省
    山东千山万水面貌一新
    大批新建工程投入春灌，去冬今春开工的大中型工程比过去十年多四倍
    本报济南15日电　山东水利建设成就辉煌，千山万水面貌一新，大批新建工程开始投入春灌。黄河位山枢纽工程位山灌区出水口，放出一百个流量，使聊城专区的许多河流和水库蓄足了水，已灌农田四百多万亩。山区五莲县冬季修建的二千多项水利工程，已有一千多处投入灌溉，库库开闸，河河放水，沟沟截流，山水下放，河水上山，使灌溉日进度达到五万多亩。全省冬灌地已达到二千万亩左右。
    山东省从去年10月以来，有九百万人参加水利建设运动。到今年1月25日止，已经提前完成大中型工程四十四项，小型水库、塘坝、蓄水池数万处，引河、引泉八千一百三十二处，打井一万一千七百六十七眼（包括机井二千三百二十九眼），改造良井二万多眼，新挖和整修各级灌溉渠道三十六万七千五百九十四条，长达四十四万多华里，修建各种建筑物二万零二百四十五座，共计完成土石方工程三十亿立方米，占全年任务的75％。这些工程可扩大灌溉面积一千五百二十三万亩，改善灌溉面积九百五十一万亩，加上原有的灌溉面积，已达到八千六百九十一万亩，全省五千万农业人口，平均每人已占有水浇地一点七三亩。控制山区水土流失面积已达到三万六千多平方公里（新增五千多平方公里），占全省总水土流失面积的72％以上。治理和改善涝洼地已占全省涝洼面积的86％。
    这种高速度的水利建设进度，再一次显示了人民公社无比的优越性。各地依靠人民公社强大的人力物力财力，去冬水利建设一开始就出现了统一规划全面治理的新局面。一般是从河源到河尾，从山头到山脚，从河身到田原，大中小型有机结合，水肥土林有机结合，天上、地下、河流三水有机结合，抓住一项一气呵成，把各项工程配套成完整系统。像位山枢纽工程，一方面集中二十万人修建引水、蓄水工程和截流工程，一方面又组织数百万人突击田间灌溉工程，现在位山一千多万亩的大灌区有六百多万亩实现了大地园田化，渠道系统化，路林规格化。在治理沂、沭、汶、泗等七条大河流中，也开始从根本上进行系统治理。临沂专区对沂、沭河流域，采用了“卡住蛟龙脖，锁住十八爪（支流），疏通万根须（小山沟）”等山水林田相结合的治理方法，使广大山区的许多岭头变成了平川园田，许多崎岖小路变成了阳关大道，自然面貌焕然一新。
    同时，在大办水利运动中，山东各人民公社都坚持了自力更生就地取材，土法上马土洋结合的原则，作到了多快好省。曹县各人民公社已经建成的三百五十六座大小建筑物和正在施工的十四座水电站，所需物料全部是自己解决的。全省去冬今春开工的二百五十五项大中型工程，比过去十年来完成的总和还多四点二倍，这样巨大的工程中，就有一百九十三项是以公社为主兴办的。
    从冬春水利建设运动中进一步证明了政治挂帅的重要性。各级党委都是第一书记挂帅，率领成千上万的得力干部，深入工地与民工同吃同住同劳动，并建立了书记库、书记渠，水利试验田等等，具体指挥，同时普遍在工地上办起了大批的工地党校，工地团校，工地文化学校，工地技术学校等各种学校，深入系统地进行了社会主义教育，使水利工地形成一个共产主义大红炉，又修水利又炼人。因此，广大民工意气风发干劲十足，到处展开超定额高工效的竞赛热潮。目前全省平均日工效达到七点五立方米。涌现出模范标兵一百多万人，创造、仿制和推广各种先进施工工具七十多种，五百二十六万多件，许多大中型水利工地已经在挖、装、运、卸、夯五道工序上达到半机械化和部分机械化施工。工地办起的厂、组七万三千七百多处，铺设各种简易铁木轨道八千三百三十公里。
    现在山东各水利工地的水利大军，除一部分转入春耕生产外，其余分作三路人马，抓紧播种前的有利时机继续突击。一路人马主攻田间渠道工程准备春灌，一路人马突击基本结束的工程扫尾工作和小型农田水利，一路继续进行大中型水利建设，争取春播前超额完成全年水利建设任务，保证当年受益。
