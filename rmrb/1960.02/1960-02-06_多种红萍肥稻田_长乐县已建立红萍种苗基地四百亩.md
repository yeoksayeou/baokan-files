    Grow More Azolla to Fertilize Rice Paddies
    Changle County Establishes 400 Mu of Azolla Seedling Bases
    (Our Newspaper’s report) Fujian’s Changle County has launched a campaign to cultivate Azolla for fertilizing fields. By January 7th, all communes and teams across the county had established over 420 mu of Azolla bases, cultivating over 500,000 jin of Azolla seedlings. These seedlings can supply 50,000 mu of early rice fields for Azolla cultivation and fertilization. Currently, under the meticulous care of commune members, these Azolla seedlings are growing vibrantly, displaying a lush red and green hue.
    Farmers in Changle County have a history of cultivating Azolla for fertilization that spans over twenty years. Due to Azolla's high fertilizer efficiency, low cost, easy management, and minimal labor requirements, the area under Azolla cultivation for fertilization has expanded annually in recent years. In 1959, the county's 17,000+ mu of early rice, fertilized with Azolla and other fertilizers, generally saw a yield increase of 10-20%. Also, each mu required seven or eight fewer workdays for manure accumulation, transportation, and application, saving seven or eight yuan in costs.
    To apply more and better fertilizer, and to strive for an even greater harvest of early rice this year, the County Party Committee diligently summarized the increased-production experiences of Yutian Brigade of Yutian Commune and Xianjie Brigade of Heshang Commune over the previous period. They recognized three major benefits of Azolla cultivation for fertilization: first, it saves labor and money, requiring only one or two workdays and one or two yuan of capital to cultivate one mu of Azolla, which can then propagate more than 50 dan of good fertilizer; second, it can improve the soil, increase soil organic matter, and transform barren fields into fertile fields; third, it can conserve fertilizer and moisture, and suppress weed growth. Furthermore, Azolla can also be used as pig feed. To promote Azolla cultivation for fertilization as a production-increasing measure, the County Party Committee issued the battle cry of “cultivate Azolla on every mu, green every plot” in December of last year, calling on all localities to establish Azolla seedling bases, massively propagate Azolla for fertilizing fields, and requiring that all early rice fields throughout the county, except those already planted with green manure or otherwise unsuitable for Azolla cultivation, should propagate Azolla.
    In the midst of this vigorous Azolla cultivation and fertilization campaign, the masses in all localities are full of enthusiasm. After holding a major debate on the benefits of Azolla cultivation, Heshang Commune immediately dispatched commune members from all twenty brigades to rivers, ponds, and pools to collect Azolla seedlings. Over the past half-month, all brigades across the commune have established a total of 111 mu of Azolla seedling bases, sufficient for the propagation of 10,000 mu of early rice fields, more than double the area in 1959. After Xianjie Brigade of this commune achieved a significant increase in production in 1959 by implementing Azolla fertilization measures on its 1,800 mu of early rice fields, the commune members are even more enthusiastic about Azolla cultivation for fertilization. They put forward the slogan of "Every jin of fertilizer must be accumulated, every Azolla plant must be cultivated," and have now established a 15 mu Azolla seedling base. Jiangtian Commune has organized a professional team of over 100 people, implementing a "three guarantees and five determinations" management system that guarantees the base, the labor, and the output of Azolla, and determines the plot, the person, the time, the quality, and the points. The commune has already established an 89 mu Azolla seedling base, with the Azolla seedlings growing very vigorously. Chengguan Commune, which previously did not cultivate Azolla, has organized cadres and commune members to visit and learn from Yutian and Heshang Communes, which have a good foundation in Azolla cultivation. In addition, all eleven brigades in the commune have established guidance networks, and have now newly established a 40 mu Azolla seedling base to learn Azolla cultivation experience.
    Currently, over 1,100 people have been organized into professional teams across the county, responsible for the management of Azolla seedling bases, to promote the propagation and growth of Azolla seedlings.

    多种红萍肥稻田
    长乐县已建立红萍种苗基地四百亩
    本报讯　福建长乐县开展养萍肥田运动，到1月7日止，全县社社队队已建立了红萍基地四百二十多亩，养殖红萍种苗五十万余斤，可供五万亩早稻田地繁殖红萍肥田。目前，这些红萍种苗，在社员精心管理下，长得一片红绿，朵朵茁壮。
    长乐县农民养殖红萍肥田已有二十多年历史。由于养萍肥田肥效高、成本低、管理易、花工少，几年来养萍肥田面积逐年扩大。1959年全县一万七千多亩早稻，由于养萍肥田加上施用其他肥料，一般都增产一至两成，每亩还少花积肥、运肥、施肥工七、八个，节约成本七、八元。
    为增施更多、更好的肥料，争取今年早稻更大丰收，县委在前一阶段认真总结了玉田公社玉田大队和鹤上公社仙街大队历年养萍肥田的增产经验，认为养萍肥田有三大好处：一，省工、省钱，养一亩萍肥田只需花一两个工，一两元本钱，就可繁殖五十担以上好肥料；二、能改良土壤，增加土壤有机质，变瘦田为肥田；三，能蓄肥保肥和抑制杂草生长。此外，红萍还可作为养猪饲料。为了推广养萍肥田这一增产措施，县委于去年12月，发出“亩亩养萍、丘丘绿化”的战斗口号，号召各地建立红萍种苗基地，大量繁殖红萍肥田，要求全县各地除已种绿肥和其他不适宜养萍田地外，所有早稻田都将繁殖红萍。
    在大搞养萍肥田运动中，各地群众干劲十足。鹤上公社通过养萍好处大辩论后，全社二十个大队立即派出社员到河浦池塘四处捞取萍苗。半个月来，全社各队共已建立红萍种苗基地一百十一亩，可供一万亩早稻田地繁殖之用，比1959年扩大了一倍多。这个社的仙街大队1959年一千八百亩早稻田推行养萍肥田措施获得显著增产后，社员对养萍肥田的情绪更高，他们提出“斤肥必积、朵萍必养”的口号，现在已建了十五亩红萍种苗基地。江田公社已组织一百多人的专业队，实行包基地、包工、包产萍和定丘、定人、定时、定质、定分的三包五定管理制度，全社已建立八十九亩红萍种苗基地，萍苗长得十分茁壮。过去没有养萍肥田的城关公社，为了学习养萍经验，除组织干部、社员到养萍基础好的玉田、鹤上等公社参观学习养萍经验外，全社十一个大队还成立了辅导网，现已新建立四十亩红萍种苗基地。
    目前，全县各地已组织一千一百多人的专业队伍，负责红萍种苗基地的管理，促进萍苗繁殖生长。
