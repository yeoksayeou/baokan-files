Xinhua News Agency, Oslo, February 17th. TASS, Oslo, February 16th: Soviet First Deputy Premier Mikoyan stated at a press conference held in Oslo, the capital of Norway, on February 16th, that the Cuban revolution is not the kind of "typical revolution occurring in Latin American countries in which one military junta replaces another." He said, "The Cuban revolution has a popular character." The Cuban revolutionaries come from the people, and these people "should be deeply respected."

Mikoyan said that if one were to judge Cuba based on the reports of American news agencies, one would know nothing about what is happening in Cuba today. American news agencies clearly dislike Cuba because the Cuban revolutionaries have deprived some large estates run by Americans.

Speaking of Cuba's land reform, Mikoyan said: Cuba's land reform is the main goal of the Cuban revolution.

Mikoyan said: "One can feel great unity among the Cuban people... The people trust their revolutionary government and are determined to defend their revolution. They say, 'Better to die standing than live on our knees.'"

Mikoyan said that the reason he wanted to talk to reporters about the Cuban issue was to illustrate that one must be fair to what is happening in Cuba and give the Cuban people and the Cuban revolution the praise they deserve.

    米高扬在奥斯陆记者招待会上说
    古巴人民决心保卫自己的革命
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社奥斯陆16日讯：苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬16日在挪威首都奥斯陆举行的记者招待会上说，古巴的革命并不是在拉丁美洲国家发生的那种“以一个军政府代替另一个军政府的通常的革命”。他说，“古巴的革命具有人民的性质”。古巴的革命者来自人民之中，这些人“应当受到深深的尊敬”。
    米高扬说，如果根据美国通讯社的报道来判断古巴的话，那么对古巴今天发生的事情将一无所知。美国通讯社对古巴显然是不喜欢的，因为古巴革命者剥夺了某些由美国人经营的大地产。
    在谈到古巴的土地改革时，米高扬说：古巴的土地改革是古巴革命的主要目的。
    米高扬说：“在古巴人民之中可以感到巨大的团结。……人民信任自己的革命政府并决心捍卫自己的革命。他们这样说：‘宁愿立着死，不愿跪着生’。”
    米高扬说，他所以要和记者们谈古巴问题，是为了说明，必须公正地对待古巴所发生的事情，给古巴人民和古巴革命以应有的赞扬。
