    Vigorously Grasp the Wheat "Turning Green" Stage

    The spring breeze brings warmth, and all things revive. Winter wheat has successfully overwintered and is beginning to turn green. People's communes in various regions are strengthening field management of wheat to ensure that the wheat is well-fed and watered, and successfully passes the turning green stage. Achieving victory in this struggle is of great significance for seizing a bumper harvest this summer.

    The situation for wheat this year is very good. The national winter wheat planting area has expanded by about 18% compared to last year, and the planting quality has also greatly improved. After sowing, various regions have also strengthened the winter management of wheat. According to statistics from eight provinces including Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Hubei, Gansu, and Guizhou, 91.7% of the wheat fields in these regions have been fertilized in winter, and 49.5% of the wheat fields in the northern provinces have been winter-irrigated. First and second-class wheat fields account for about 90% of the total wheat field area, and the seedlings in all types of wheat fields are growing better than in the same period last year. All of this has prepared excellent conditions for a bumper wheat harvest. The current task is to continue to exert full effort, strive for the upstream, make a series of efforts in field management, and achieve a bumper harvest this summer. The first thing is to successfully pass the turning green stage. Years of experience tell us that the climate change during the wheat turning green period is relatively complex, and spring drought and frost may occur. Currently, many regions have already experienced drought, and wheat diseases and insect pests have also begun to appear in some areas. In this case, a little carelessness can cause losses. Therefore, it is necessary to double our efforts, strengthen wheat field management, closely defend against natural disasters, and create all conditions for wheat to turn green and grow.

    How should we strengthen field management during the wheat turning green period? Based on the experience of wheat production over the years and the production characteristics of this year, it can be summarized into four words: "early, much, meticulous, and ruthless," as the guiding ideology for wheat field management. Among the four words, "early" comes first. Only by grasping it early can it be possible to achieve "much, meticulous, and ruthless." The so-called "early" means to start early, prepare early for wheat turning green, and ensure sufficient water and fertilizer supply after the turning green period arrives. Everyone knows that the level of wheat yield is determined by three factors: number of ears, number of grains, and grain weight. More ears, bigger ears, more grains, and fuller grains can increase production. Under the conditions of reasonable close planting, the more total tillers per unit area, the more ears, and the higher the yield. The wheat turning green period is the final juncture for determining the total number of tillers and ears per mu. It is necessary to topdress fertilizer early, irrigate early, and manage early to promote tillering, healthy growth, and improve the effective tillering rate, and appropriately extend the differentiation period of spikelets to achieve more ears and bigger ears. Early action can not only ensure the successful passing of the wheat turning green stage, but also "early one thing, early everything," which can comprehensively arrange labor and various operation times, and facilitate freeing up hands to prepare for spring sowing and develop diversified operations. The second is "much." "Much" means to topdress more fertilizer, irrigate more water, and manage more. This year, the winter management of wheat is good, with many strong seedlings, which can eat and drink well, requiring a sufficient supply of water and fertilizer. The example of the Beiloudi Brigade of the Wurenqiao People's Commune in Anguo County, Hebei Province, can well illustrate this issue. In 1958, this team had twelve mu of third-class wheat, with only 390,000 plants per mu before winter. Because it supplied sufficient water and fertilizer during the turning green period and also carried out harrowing and rolling, the spring tillering increased greatly, with 680,000 ears at harvest, and the yield per mu reached 653 jin. Another ten mu of first-class wheat in the same brigade had 820,000 tillers per mu before winter. Because they were afraid of lodging, they dared not topdress fertilizer or irrigate during the turning green period. As a result, there were only 480,000 ears at harvest, and the yield per mu was only 359 jin. Only with a full supply of fertilizer and water can wheat have more ears, bigger ears, more grains, and fuller grains. The third is "meticulous." With more fertilizer and more water, management requires extra care and striving for perfection. With sufficient water and fertilizer, it is necessary to apply fertilizer and irrigate "watching the sky, watching the ground, and watching the seedlings," to achieve rational fertilization and scientific water use, and "field management like embroidery." Finally, "ruthless." It is necessary to ruthlessly grasp the key issues in the current field management, and resolutely and comprehensively implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. Ensuring that wheat has enough water and fertilizer is the central link in wheat field management during the turning green period, which requires us to vigorously and ruthlessly grasp fertilizer. The same is true for water. According to the natural characteristics of this year, drought prevention, rust prevention, and frost prevention are also prominent issues in the current wheat field management work. Last winter, some areas had less rain and snow, and spring drought emerged. Therefore, it is necessary to seize the time before and after thawing, harrow and roll to preserve soil moisture, make full use of all water sources, expand spring irrigation, and prevent and overcome spring drought. Wheat rust has also occurred in many areas, and we should be alert and prevent and control it as soon as possible.

    The most effective way to implement "early, much, meticulous, and ruthless" is to grasp large-area high-yield fields (high-yield squares, high-yield areas, etc.) to drive general fields, combine point and area, comprehensively manage, and comprehensively increase production. Since the autumn sowing in 1959, the wheat high-yield squares and high-yield areas established in many provinces account for about 30% of the total wheat field area. The wheat in high-yield squares and high-yield areas grows better than general fields. Relying on the high-yield of these 30% of wheat fields to drive the production increase of general wheat fields, there is a reliable guarantee for completing this year's wheat production increase plan. Although wheat growth is generally good this year, compared with each other, there are still good, medium, and poor distinctions. Not only do areas with lower yields have more weak seedlings and secondary seedlings, but even areas with higher yields also have a small portion of third-class fields and third-class seedlings. If the wheat yield in low-yield fields cannot be significantly improved, the unit area yield and total output of all wheat fields will be affected. If it was not possible to completely eliminate low-yield fields and third-class seedlings in the past, then now, relying on the superior conditions and strong organizational power of the people's communes, launching a large-scale mass movement, grasping both ends, and leading the middle, trying every means to eliminate the "dead corners" of wheat fields, it can be affirmed that the universal elimination of low-yield fields is completely possible. Luoyang Prefecture in Henan Province has universally launched the "five-catch" movement of "catching up with early stubble with late stubble, catching up with flat land with slope land, catching up with water land with dry land, catching up with first-class with third-class, and catching up with advanced with backward," making wheat field management advance victoriously step by step. This approach is worthy of everyone's emulation.

    In order to ensure that the field management during the wheat turning green period is completed on time with quantity and quality, proper arrangements must be made for labor. At present, some areas have insufficient labor input in wheat field management, and should be appropriately allocated according to needs, and combine professional management with shock management. It is necessary to establish and improve the field management responsibility system of assigning people, assigning fields, determining quality, determining time, and determining work points. The management of high-yield squares must establish a responsibility system, and helping third-class seedlings to upgrade must also establish a responsibility system.

    In order to strengthen the field management during the wheat turning green period, in order to vigorously launch the mass movement to seize a bumper harvest this summer, the party organizations in various regions are required to strengthen the leadership of wheat production. This year, we should better use the various advanced leadership methods created since the Great Leap Forward, vigorously carry out large-scale inspections, large-scale evaluations, establish pacesetters, and lead the backward, promptly convene on-site meetings, promote advanced experience, and set off a mass upsurge in wheat field management. There is no doubt that as long as we resolutely implement political command, cadres and the masses exert revolutionary efforts, seize the season, take the initiative, prepare fully, and take active action, we will be able to guarantee that wheat will successfully pass the turning green stage and lay a victorious foundation for a bumper harvest this summer.

### 大抓小麦“返青关”

    大抓小麦“返青关”
    春风送暖，万物复苏。冬小麦已经胜利越冬，开始返青。各地人民公社正在加强小麦田间管理，保证小麦吃饱喝足，过好返青关。取得这场斗争的胜利，对于夺取今年夏季大丰收有着重大的意义。
    今年小麦的形势很好。全国冬小麦播种面积比上年扩大了18％左右，播种质量也大大提高。在播种之后，各地又加强了小麦越冬管理。根据河南、山东、河北、陕西、江苏、湖北、甘肃、贵州八省的统计，这些地区有91．7％的麦田施了冬肥，其中北方省份有49．5％的麦田进行了冬灌，一、二类麦田占麦田总面积的90％左右，而且各类麦田的小苗都比去年同期长得好。所有这些都为小麦丰收准备了很好的条件。当前的任务是，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，在田间管理上作一系列的努力，实现夏季大丰收。首先就要过好返青关。历年的经验告诉我们：小麦返青期间的气候变化比较复杂，春旱、霜冻都可能发生。目前也已有不少地区发生了干旱，小麦的病虫害也在一些地区开始出现。在这种情况下，稍有疏忽大意，就会造成损失。因此，必须劲上加劲，加强麦田田间管理，严密防御自然灾害，为小麦返青生长创造一切条件。
    应当怎样来加强小麦返青期间的田间管理呢？根据历年小麦生产的经验和今年生产特点，可以归纳为“早、多、细、狠”四个字，作为小麦田间管理的指导思想。四字之中，早字当头。只有抓得早，才有可能作到多、细、狠。所谓早，就是早动手，早为小麦返青作好各种准备，保证返青期到来后，水肥供应充足。大家知道，小麦产量高低，是由穗数、粒数、粒重三个因素决定的，穗多、穗大、粒多、粒饱就能增产。在合理密植的情况下，单位面积上总分蘖数愈多，穗数也愈多，产量也愈高。小麦返青期是决定每亩总分蘖数和穗数的最后关头，必须早追肥，早浇水，早管理，促使分蘖，健壮生长，提高有效分蘖率，并可适当延长小穗分化期，达到穗多、穗大。早动手，不但可以保证过好小麦返青关，而且一早百早，可以全面安排劳力和各项作业时间，便于腾出手来作好春播准备和开展多种经营。其次是多。多，就是要多追肥，多浇水，多管理。今年小麦越冬管理好，苗多苗壮，能吃能喝，要求充分供应足够的水和肥。河北省安国县伍仁桥人民公社北楼底大队的例子，很能说明这个问题。1958年这个队有十二亩三类麦，冬前每亩只有三十九万株，由于在返青期供应了充分的水、肥，又进行了耙轧，春季分蘖大增，收获时有六十八万穗，亩产达到六百五十三斤；同一个大队另外有十亩一类麦，冬前分蘖每亩有八十二万个，因为怕倒伏，返青期不敢追肥、浇水，结果收获时只有四十八万穗，亩产只有三百五十九斤。只有充分供应肥和水，小麦才能穗多、穗大，粒多、粒饱。再次是细。肥多了，水多了，管理上就要求格外细致，精益求精。有了充足的水和肥，就需要“看天，看地，看苗”施肥、浇水，做到合理施肥，科学用水，“田间管理如绣花”。最后是狠。就是要狠狠地抓住当前田间管理中的关键问题，坚决地全面地贯彻实行农业“八字宪法”。保证小麦有足够的水、肥，是返青期间麦田管理的中心环节，这就需要我们大抓狠抓肥料。水也是如此。根据今年自然特点，防旱、防锈和防冻又是当前麦田管理工作的突出的问题。去冬有些地区雨雪较少，春旱露头，因此，必须抓紧解冻前后，耙、压保墒，充分利用一切水源，扩大春灌，预防和战胜春旱。小麦锈病也已在不少地区发生，我们应该引起警惕，及早防治。
    实行“早、多、细、狠”，最有效的办法，就是抓住大面积丰产田（丰产方、丰产片等）带动一般田，点面结合，全面管理，全面增产。1959年秋播以来，许多省建立的小麦丰产方、丰产片，约占麦田总面积的30％左右。丰产方、丰产片的小麦比一般田的长得更好。依靠这30％左右麦田的高额丰产，来带动一般麦田的增产，完成今年小麦增产计划就有了可靠的保证。今年小麦生长虽然普遍良好，但比较起来，仍有好、中、差之分。不仅产量较低的地区有较多的弱苗、次苗，就是产量较高的地区也有小部分三类田、三类苗。如果产量低的田的小麦产量不能显著提高，全部麦田的单位面积产量和总产量都会受到影响。如果说，过去还不可能全部消灭低产田和三类苗，那末，现在依靠人民公社的优越条件和强大的组织力量，大搞群众运动，抓两头，带中间，千方百计消灭麦田的“死角”，可以肯定，普遍消灭低产田已经是完全可能的了。河南省洛阳专区普遍开展了“回茬赶早茬，坡地赶平地，旱地赶水地，三类赶一类，后进赶先进”的五赶运动，使麦田管理节节胜利地前进。这种做法，值得大家效法。
    为了保证小麦返青期田间管理按量按质按时完成，对于劳力必须作出妥善的安排。目前，有些地区投入麦田管理的劳力不足，应当根据需要适当调配，并且把专业管理和突击管理结合起来。要建立和健全定人、定田、定质量、定时间、定工分的田间管理责任制，丰产方的管理要建立责任制，帮助三类苗升级同样也要建立责任制。
    为了加强小麦返青期田间管理，为了把夺取夏季大丰收的群众运动轰轰烈烈地开展起来，要求各地党的组织加强对小麦生产的领导。今年应当更好地运用大跃进以来创造的各种先进的领导方法，大力开展大检查、大评比、树标兵、带落后，及时召开现场会议，推广先进经验，掀起群众性的麦田管理热潮。毫无疑问，只要坚决实行政治挂帅，干部和群众鼓足革命干劲，抓紧季节，掌握主动，充分准备，积极行动，就一定能够保证小麦胜利过返青关，为夏季大丰收打下胜利基础。
