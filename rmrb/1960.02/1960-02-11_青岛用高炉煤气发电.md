After receiving instructions from higher authorities on promoting the advanced experience of using blast furnace gas to burn boilers for power generation, the workers of the No. 4 Power Plant of the Qingdao Power Bureau immediately organized a special team to conduct experiments. They sent the gas drawn from the blast furnace of the No. 1 Workshop of the nearby Qingdao No. 4 Steel Plant to a ten-ton boiler to burn instead of coal. After several days of operation, the results were good, and the boiler's heat supply remained normal.

By utilizing blast furnace gas, this boiler can save ten to twelve tons of raw coal per day. After using blast furnace gas, the working hours for loading, unloading, and transporting coal, as well as ash removal, have been shortened. Preliminary calculations show that labor can be saved by more than 25 percent.

    青岛用高炉煤气发电
    青岛市电业局第四发电厂职工在见到上级关于推广利用高炉煤气烧锅炉发电的先进经验的指示以后，立即组织专门机构进行试验。他们把附近青岛第四钢铁厂的第一车间高炉上引出来的煤气，送到一台十吨锅炉里代替煤炭来燃烧。经过多日运行，效果良好，锅炉供热一直正常。
    由于利用了煤气，这座锅炉每天可以节约原煤十吨到十二吨；利用煤气以后，缩短了装卸、运输煤炭和出灰等工序的工时，初步计算可以节省劳动力百分之二十五以上。
