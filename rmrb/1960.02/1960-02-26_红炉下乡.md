    Red Furnace Goes to the Countryside
    Gan Rui
    The iron hammer rings, rings loudly,
    Old Liu is busy around the red furnace,
    Working tirelessly before and after the furnace all day long,
    Sweat soaks through his lined clothes,
    Making the hoes shine like mirrors,
    Mounting the ploughshares in rows.
    Squad Leader Shen is busy with spring plowing,
    Returning to the village only after meetings late at night,
    Seeing Old Liu working non-stop,
    He is grateful and excitedly has a heart-to-heart talk,
    Asking "Old Liu, comrade, don't you feel tired?"
    "Why did you come to the countryside so early this year!?"
    Master Liu, Squad Leader Shen,
    Look at each other and smile meaningfully,
    In the Leap Forward era, we leap forward together,
    The earlier the better, the more like it should be,
    Thinking hard and innovating,
    All for a better harvest in the autumn.

    红炉下乡
    甘瑞
    铁锤响，响叮当，
    老刘围着红炉忙，
    炉前炉后成天累，
    汗水浸透裌衣裳，
    整的挖锄明如镜，
    装的铧犁排成行。
    申队长，春耕忙，
    开会半夜才回乡，
    一见老刘忙不停，
    感谢激动谈心肠，
    问声“老刘同志你不知累？”
    “今年为啥这早就下乡！？”
    刘师傅，申队长，
    相顾一笑意深长，
    跃进年代齐跃进，
    一早百早才像样，
    苦思苦想闹革新，
    为的秋后多收粮。
