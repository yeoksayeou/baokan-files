	Using Soviet Fine Breed Livestock for Mating
	The Qinghai Province State-run Sanjiaocheng Sheep Farm has used Soviet Caucasian fine breed sheep to crossbreed with local Tibetan sheep, and has cultivated hybrid sheep of the second generation and above, with very high production performance, most of which have reached ideal type indicators.  Hybrid horses born from crossbreeding Soviet fine breed horses with local horses in various parts of Qinghai Province are superior to local horses of the same age in terms of height, length, and chest circumference.

	Promoting Artificial Insemination of Pigs
	Wangyue People's Commune in Changsha County, Hunan Province, has established thirteen artificial insemination stations, and the breeders of each sow farm have mastered the insemination techniques. Now all pigs in the commune are using artificial insemination, which has improved the reproduction rate of pigs; one boar can provide breeding for more than one thousand sows a year.

	Establishing a Pig Raising Guidance Network
	Yongtai County, Fujian Province, has established a pig raising guidance network.
	Its organizational form is: the county establishes a guidance network, the commune establishes a guidance station, the brigade establishes guidance points, and each commune and brigade selects pig farms with remarkable pig raising achievements and rich experience as the base for building the network.  Guidance networks at all levels create experience in all aspects of pig raising work and comprehensively guide pig production.

	Vigorously Build Warm Sheds and Double Pens
	Each commune in Delingha County, Qinghai Province, closely combines with current production to vigorously build warm sheds and double pens. They are determined to build 350 heated kang warm sheds and 427 double pens in the near future, so as to realize that all lambs have warm sheds and all adult livestock have double pens throughout the county, allowing all livestock to safely overwinter and pass through the spring.
