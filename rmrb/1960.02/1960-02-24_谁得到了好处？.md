Who Benefits?

    In a speech prior to his visit to South America, U.S. President Eisenhower said, "We have made substantial investments in Latin American enterprises. We are providing new loans in amounts larger than ever before… Our outstanding loans and investments in Latin America now exceed eleven billion dollars."

    Why does the United States maintain such a massive amount of investment and loans in Latin America?

    U.S. President Eisenhower said, "We want every American country to achieve rapid economic development, benefiting all its people."

    However, his brother, Milton Eisenhower, who is also his advisor on Latin American affairs, said, "Helping Latin America achieve its economic goals serves the best interests of the United States itself."

    See, two brothers, with completely contradictory statements. Are U.S. investments and loans in Latin America intended to benefit the Latin American people, or to benefit the United States?

    Which Eisenhower is being more frank? Let the facts answer this question!

    According to a report in the Argentine magazine "New Era," there are approximately 2,000 U.S. companies operating in Latin America. Between 1946 and 1957 alone, these companies repatriated over 5.6 billion U.S. dollars in profits to the United States. According to United Nations statistics, U.S. monopoly capital earns a profit of $3.17 for every dollar invested.

    Even the United States does not deny this fact.

    "Modern Business Overview" once reported that from 1954 to 1957, the net U.S. investment flowing into Latin America was $2 billion. During the same period, the profits obtained by the United States from Latin American countries amounted to $3 billion.

    What this greedy plunder has brought to the Latin American people is obvious. U.S. Senator Capehart cited a fact that is very illustrative: the annual profits obtained by the United States in Latin America are equal to the total investment of all Latin American countries for twelve years. No wonder the economies of many Latin American countries are in dire straits.

    However, U.S. monopoly capital is not satisfied with such a profitable business. Alberto Powells, a trade advisor to the U.S. Department of Commerce, recently told Colombian reporters bluntly: "Your people must create opportunities favorable to industry and commerce, so as to attract American investment. You must also remember that you must give these investments the opportunity to obtain greater profits than they would at home."

    Regarding U.S. loans to Latin American countries, a document published by the Cuban newspaper "Hoy" on February 21 is extremely telling.

    According to the accounts published by "Hoy," for every dollar Cuba obtained from the United States in loans, it had to pay the United States $0.6141 in interest.

    From 1904 to 1942, Cuba signed twelve loan agreements with the United States, with a nominal total loan amount of $410,827,880. In reality, Cuba only received $395,915,625. However, Cuba paid a total of $243,131,642 in interest to the United States.

    The total interest paid on some loans even exceeded the total loan amount. For example, Cuba's first loan was nominally $35 million with an annual interest rate of 5%. In reality, Cuba only received $31,675,000. But over forty years, Cuba paid $41,881,683 in interest. The second loan in 1909 was $16.5 million with an annual interest rate of 4%. In reality, Cuba only received $14.5 million. But over forty years, Cuba paid a total of $20,849,601 in interest on this loan. The third loan in 1914 was $10 million with an annual interest rate of 5%. In thirty-five years, Cuba had already paid $9,900,974 in interest.

    The interest rate on some U.S. loans to Cuba was as high as 6% per annum.

    What appalling figures! The material shows clearly how American usurers have used loans to plunder Latin America by trickery and extortion.

### 谁得到了好处？

专栏：数字与事实

    谁得到了好处？
    美国总统艾森豪威尔在访问南美前夕发表的演说中说：“我们对拉丁美洲的企业中作了很大的投资。我们正在提供数目比以前任何时候更大的新贷款……我们在拉丁美洲的未偿付的贷款和投资现在超出一百一十亿美元。”
    美国为什么要在拉丁美洲保持数量那末巨大的投资和贷款呢？
    美国总统艾森豪威尔说：“我们希望每一个美洲国家在经济上得到迅速发展，而使全体人民得到好处。”
    但是，他的弟弟、也是他的拉丁美洲事务顾问密尔顿·艾森豪威尔却说：“帮助拉丁美洲实现它的经济目标，要服务于美国本身的最大利益。”
    看，兄弟两人，说法截然相反。美国在拉丁美洲的投资和贷款究竟是为了使拉丁美洲人民得到好处，还是为了使美国得到利益呢？
    究竟是哪个艾森豪威尔说得坦率一些？让事实来答复这个问题吧！
    据阿根廷“新纪元”杂志的报道，美国在拉丁美洲经营的公司约有二千家。仅仅在1946到1957年之间，这些公司汇回美国的利润就高达五十六亿多美元。据联合国的统计材料，美国垄断资本每投资一块美元就能获得三块一毛七分美元的利润。
    这个事实，连美国自己也不否认。
    美国“现代商业概览”曾经报道过，从1954年到1957年，美国流入拉丁美洲的纯投资额为二十亿美元。在同一时期内，美国从拉丁美洲各国所取得的利润为三十亿美元。
    美国这种贪婪的掠夺，给拉丁美洲人民带来了什么，这是显而易见的事情。美国参议员凯普哈特举出过一个很能说明问题的事实：美国在拉丁美洲一年所得的利润，等于拉丁美洲各国十二年的投资总额。这就无怪乎很多拉丁美洲国家的经济要陷于不幸的灾难中了。
    但是，美国垄断资本对于这种一本万利的好生意并没有感到满足。美国商务部贸易顾问阿尔伯托·鲍威尔斯不久以前就曾露骨地对哥伦比亚的记者说过：“你们的人民要创造有利于工商业的机会，这样才能吸引美国的投资。你们还要记住，你们要让这些投资有机会比在本国取得更大的利润。”
    关于美国对拉丁美洲国家的贷款，古巴“今日报”在2月21日公布的一份材料是极能说明问题的。
    根据“今日报”公布的账目可以看出：古巴从美国每得到一个美元的贷款，就得付给美国六毛一分四厘一（美元）的利息。
    从1904年到1942年间，古巴同美国签订过十二次贷款协定，贷款总额名义上为四亿一千零八十二万七千八百八十美元，实际上古巴只得到三亿九千五百九十一万五千六百二十五美元。但是古巴总共支付给美国的利息达二亿四千三百一十三万一千六百四十二美元。
    有几次贷款所支付的利息总额竟超过了贷款总额。例如，古巴第一次贷款名义上为三千五百万美元，年利五厘，实际上古巴只得到三千一百六十七万五千美元。但是在四十年中古巴支付的利息竟达四千一百八十八万一千六百八十三美元。1909年的第二次贷款是一千六百五十万美元，年利四厘。实际上古巴只得到一千四百五十万美元。但是在四十年中，古巴支付这笔贷款的利息共达二千零八十四万九千六百零一美元。1914年的第三次贷款是一千万美元，年利五厘。在三十五年中古巴已经支付了九百九十万零九千九百七十四美元的利息。
    美国对古巴贷款的利息有几次曾提高到年利六厘。
    多么骇人听闻的数字啊！美国高利贷者怎样利用贷款对拉丁美洲进行了巧取豪夺，从这个材料里已经可以看得一清二楚了。
