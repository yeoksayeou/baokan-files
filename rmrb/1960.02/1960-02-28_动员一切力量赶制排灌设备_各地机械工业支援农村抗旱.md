Xinhua News Agency, February 27th: A mass movement to seize the time and rush the season to manufacture and repair agricultural irrigation and drainage machinery is flourishing in the national machinery industry. The central task of this movement is: in the first quarter, do everything possible to increase the production of more and better diesel engines, gas engines, agricultural water pumps, and various pipes, belts, etc., to support the drought prevention and resistance movement that is being widely carried out in some rural areas.

In order to strengthen the leadership of this movement, the State Economic Commission, the First Ministry of Machine Building, and the Ministry of Agricultural Machinery have taken measures to concentrate efforts to strongly support provinces in producing and repairing irrigation and drainage machinery in terms of equipment, materials, and technical forces. Commercial, metallurgical, and other relevant departments, as well as provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, are also taking corresponding measures to assist factories in solving the steel, pig iron, and other collaborative parts needed for the production and repair of irrigation and drainage machinery.

Since last winter, rainfall in many areas of our country has been less than normal. Some or most areas of provinces such as Henan, Shaanxi, and Guangdong have experienced drought. According to meteorological forecasts, rainfall in the Yellow River basin provinces of Gansu, Shaanxi, and Henan may still be low in March, April, and May. In order to strongly support farmers in drought resistance and prevention, and to do a good job in wheat protection and spring sowing, the mechanical industry workers in various regions, at the beginning of this year, have listed the production of irrigation and drainage machinery as the primary task of supporting agriculture. The agricultural machinery departments of Sichuan Province, based on the characteristics of this year's large task and urgent time for the production of irrigation and drainage machinery, have adopted methods such as large factories leading small factories, and old factories leading new factories, and carried out large-scale collaboration throughout the province, organizing more than 50 factories with strong technical equipment to undertake major parts, ensuring the complete supply of products. Now, this province has not only completed the first quarter's production task of irrigation and drainage machinery ahead of schedule, but also increased the production of more than 10,000 horsepower of internal combustion engines. In Jiangsu Province, a new high tide of competition is being set off among agricultural machinery factories to strive to complete the agricultural machinery needed for spring plowing ahead of schedule. Their slogan is "Rather let the machine wait for the farming season than let the farming season wait for the machine." By February 20th, the province had already produced more than 100,000 horsepower of internal combustion engines and locomobiles, accounting for more than 70% of the first quarter's plan. Shandong Province's machinery industry, on the basis of completing the production tasks of power machinery and water pumps last year ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota, has further improved diesel engines and other products this year, thus making the quality better and the cost lower. The Zibo Dingfeng Kiln Factory in this province has successfully trial-produced a ceramic water pump with high power and low price, which is welcomed by the majority of farmers.

According to incomplete statistics from the Ministry of Agricultural Machinery, as of mid-February, the total number of various irrigation and drainage machinery produced nationwide has reached more than 380,000 horsepower. This number is more than all the agricultural irrigation and drainage machinery produced in the fourth quarter of last year's Great Leap Forward. A large part of it has been supplied to rural areas.

While manufacturing new equipment, the mechanical industry departments in various regions, under the leadership and unified command of the Party committees, have transferred technical forces to help communes repair and match tractors and irrigation and drainage machinery. According to statistics from Hubei, Hunan, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hebei, Jilin and other provinces, the irrigation and drainage machinery that has been repaired and matched already accounts for more than 70% to 80% of the total amount to be repaired in each province. Many provinces' workers have also proposed that by the end of February or at the latest by March 10th, all irrigation and drainage machinery in rural areas that has stopped being used due to lack of accessories or damage should be fully repaired and started. Many machinery factories in Liaoning, Shanxi, Jiangxi, Sichuan and other provinces have established regular contact with people's communes, dispatching some technicians who bring their own tools and equipment to go deep into rural areas to repair and match equipment on the spot, while imparting technology and helping communes establish repair stations.

### 动员一切力量赶制排灌设备  各地机械工业支援农村抗旱

    动员一切力量赶制排灌设备
    各地机械工业支援农村抗旱
    新华社27日讯　一个抢时间、赶季节突击制造和修配农业排灌机械的群众运动，正在全国机械工业部门蓬勃展开。这个运动的中心任务是：要在第一季度内千方百计地增产更多更好的柴油机、煤气机、农用水泵、以及各种管路、皮带等，支援当前某些地区农村中正在广泛开展的防旱、抗旱运动。
    为了加强对这一运动的领导，国家经济委员会、第一机械工业部和农业机械部已经采取措施，集中力量从设备、材料、技术力量等各个方面，大力支援各省生产和修理排灌机械。商业、冶金等有关部门及各省、市、自治区，也正在采取相应的措施，协助各厂解决生产和修理排灌机械所需要的钢材、生铁以及其他协作配件。
    去冬以来，我国不少地区降水量较常年为少，河南、陕西、广东等省都有一部分或大部分地区发生干旱现象。据气象预测，黄河流域的甘肃、陕西、河南等省在3、4、5月份雨量仍可能偏少。为了有力地支援农民抗旱、防旱，做好保麦、春播等工作，各地机械工业职工在今年一开始，就把生产排灌机械列为当前支援农业的首要任务。四川省农业机械部门根据今年生产排灌机械任务大、时间紧迫等特点，采取了大厂带小厂，老厂带新厂等办法，在全省范围内开展了大协作，组织五十多个技术设备较强的工厂承担主要配件，保证了产品的成套供应。现在，这个省不但提前完成了第一季度的排灌机械生产任务，而且还增产了一万多匹马力的内燃机。江苏省各农业机械厂之间，正在掀起一个争取提前完成春耕需要的农业机械的竞赛新高潮。他们的口号是“宁让机器等农时，不让农时等机器”，到2月20日全省就已经生产出十万多匹马力的内燃机、锅驼机，占第一季度计划的70％以上。山东省机械工业在提前超额完成去年的动力机械和水泵生产任务的基础上，今年对柴油机等产品又作了进一步改进，因而使质量更好，成本更低。这个省的淄博鼎丰窑厂试制成功了一种陶瓷水泵，功率高，售价低，受到广大农民的欢迎。
    据农业机械部的不完全统计，到2月中旬止，全国已经生产的各种排灌机械，总数已达三十八万多匹马力。这个数字，比大跃进的去年第四季度生产的全部农业排灌机械还多。其中有很大部分已经供应到农村。
    在制造新设备的同时，各地机械工业部门在党委的领导和统一指挥下，抽调技术力量，帮助公社修配拖拉机和排灌机械。据湖北、湖南、浙江、江苏、河北、吉林等省的统计，目前已经修复配套的排灌机械，已占各省全部应修量的70％到80％以上。许多省的职工还提出，要在2月底最迟3月10日以前，使农村中因缺配件或损坏而停止使用的排灌机械，全部修复开动起来。辽宁、山西、江西、四川等省的许多机械厂，同人民公社建立了经常联系，派遣一部分技术工人，自带工具、设备深入农村就地修配，同时传授技术，帮助公社建立修配站。
