Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 28th - A mass movement to improve low-yielding field soil is unfolding extensively throughout Yunnan Province. According to recent statistics, the province has already improved more than two million mu of soil.

According to surveys, various localities in Yunnan Province have many low-yielding fields with poor soil quality, such as clay fields and sandy fields. To change the soil of these low-yielding fields and increase grain production, various localities have formed specialized soil improvement teams while managing spring crops and preparing to sow major spring crops. They have adopted many successful experiences based on the principle of adapting to local conditions.

In the movement to improve low-yielding field soil, various localities have also launched a high-efficiency competition centered on reforming tools. At present, most areas of the province are using handcarts and animal-drawn carts to transport various fertilizers and lime, which has greatly improved work efficiency and saved a lot of manpower.

    为更大丰收打下基础
    云南改良低产田土壤二百多万亩
    据新华社昆明28日电　一个改良低产田土壤的群众运动，正在云南省各地广泛展开。根据最近的统计，全省已改良土壤二百多万亩。
    根据普查，云南省各地都有不少胶泥田、砂田等土质不好的低产田，为了改变这些低产田的土壤，增产更多的粮食，各地在管理小春作物和准备播种大春作物的同时，都组成改良土壤的专业队，根据因地制宜的原则，采用了许多成功的经验。
    各地在改良低产田土壤的运动中，还开展了以改革工具为中心的高工效竞赛。目前，全省大部分地区运送各种肥料和石灰，都已使用手推车和畜力车，大大提高了工效，节省了许多人力。
