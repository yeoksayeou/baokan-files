    Shanghai's Great Exchange and Collaboration in Technological Innovation
    The city, districts, and factories hold large-scale exhibitions to promote the popularization, improvement, re-popularization, and re-improvement of technological innovation
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 14th (Reporter Zhang Jiachi) -- To adapt to the new high tide of the current technological innovation movement, Shanghai is holding large-scale exhibitions of technological innovation and technological revolution throughout the city to widely disseminate advanced ideas and conduct a great review, exchange, and collaboration of technological innovation. Since the beginning of the New Year, nineteen exhibitions organized by the city and districts have been held in twenty-three venues throughout the city. At the same time, large factories, enterprises, and grassroots units have also widely held exhibitions. The city and district exhibitions are of enormous scale, with a total exhibition area of more than 21,500 square meters, featuring more than 17,400 exhibits, almost all of the latest and best technological innovation achievements from all walks of life in the city. For more than a month, the exhibitions have carried out a variety of mass activities, becoming a concentrated place for workers and the masses throughout the city to quickly and effectively learn and exchange advanced experiences, and a lively school for conducting mass self-education and promoting communist style. More than 1.5 million workers from all walks of life have visited and participated in the activities. Holding large-scale exhibitions has played a significant role in popularizing technological innovation, as well as playing a role of "popularization – improvement – re-popularization – re-improvement."

    Shanghai's large-scale exhibitions of technological innovation and technological revolution are held by relying on grassroots cadres and the masses through mass movements. Therefore, each exhibition is not only organized quickly and well, but also closely integrated with the technological innovation and technological revolution movements of factories and enterprises, powerfully promoting the development of the movement. Most of the nineteen exhibitions organized by the city and districts are organized by grassroots units themselves, who nominate exhibits and serve as art designers, arrangers, explainers, and performers. Therefore, they are prepared within a few days, with the shortest taking only thirty-six hours to open to the public. To strive to "offer treasures" to the exhibition, many workers and masses in factories and enterprises have sped up the realization of innovation projects, making the preparation process of the exhibition a process of mobilizing the masses and vigorously engaging in technological innovation. To welcome the opening of the exhibition, the printing industry workers in Huangpu District concentrated various innovations on the platen printing presses in the entire industry and created a brand-new eleven-item innovative platen printing press, which mechanized all manual printing. Many industries and factories have organized workers and the masses to "learn from the scriptures" and "offer treasures" to the exhibition, launching a high tide of technological innovation and technological revolution in the entire industry. Within three days, more than three thousand workers in seventeen factories in the garment processing industry in Huangpu District put forward 13,418 innovation proposals and realized 2,264 of them, of which more than twenty innovations were selected for the exhibition. After visiting the exhibition, the workers took back a large amount of advanced experience and further engaged in large-scale technological innovation. By organizing the exhibitions through mass movements, not only is the high tide of technological innovation in factories and enterprises powerfully promoted, but also the exhibition content is enriched, truly becoming the largest venue for the review of technological innovation in the city.

    During the exhibition, various effective methods of promoting and exchanging advanced experiences in the past were comprehensively applied, such as holding professional exchange meetings, on-site performance meetings, knife-comparing meetings, study classes, lectures, etc., to quickly and effectively popularize a large number of advanced experiences, fully meeting the urgent requirements of the workers and masses to learn from and catch up with advanced elements. Based on the characteristic of many manual operations by fitters in the district, the Yangpu District Exhibition organized more than five hundred fitters from more than two hundred factories to hold a professional exchange meeting on the mechanization of fitter operations. In addition to organizing visits to innovative exhibits, the meeting also featured oral explanations and operation demonstrations by advanced producers and advanced units, enabling each fitter attending the meeting to learn several to more than a dozen advanced experiences. The Xuhui District Exhibition found that lathe operators were very interested in the high-speed cutting tools, AC electric spark grinding machines, and the conversion of old lathes to automation exhibited, so it held three sessions of lathe operator training classes, specializing in teaching these three advanced experiences. Veteran workers served as teachers in the training classes, adopting the teaching method of "one look" (watching operation demonstrations), "two lectures" (explaining technical principles), and "three distributions" (distributing drawings and materials). In just two evenings, the trainees basically mastered these three advanced experiences. The lathe operators all called the training class a "fast, efficient, and economical technical school." After graduating from the training, many of the more than 830 lathe operators returned to their factories to pass on the experience they had learned to others, causing advanced experiences to blossom and bear fruit everywhere. Many exhibitions also broke the routine when receiving general visitors, not only explaining the design and use of exhibits in detail, but also disassembling exhibits for visitors to see, allowing visitors to draw pictures and experiment, and providing visitors with learning convenience as much as possible.

    The various activities organized by the exhibition to facilitate mass learning and exchange also played a role in evaluating, summarizing, and appraising innovative experiences. At the Yangpu District Fitter Operation Mechanization Exchange Meeting, everyone introduced several universal scribing machines. After mass evaluation, it was believed that a machine created by Jin Shengming, a fitter at the Xinye Electric Factory, had ten major advantages and the highest production efficiency. The technical information of this scribing machine was distributed on the spot to four hundred copies. The Jing'an District Exhibition concentrated one hundred and eight advanced turning tools and held a "knife-comparing meeting." As a result, twelve turning tools were awarded prizes and determined to be advanced turning tools promoted throughout the district.

    Carrying out mass production and technical collaboration is an important aspect of exhibition activities. All exhibitions have established collaboration halls, key problem platforms, and technical collaboration offices to organize activities such as "outpatient clinics," "consultations," "emergency treatment," "key problem tackling days," and "key problem tackling meetings." Workers and the masses throughout the city can not only learn advanced experience at the exhibition, but also bring difficulties and key problems in production technology to the exhibition to seek collaborative solutions. Walking into the collaboration hall, there are large character posters everywhere, some of which are putting forward key problems to seek collaboration, and some of which are leaving their names and addresses, expressing their willingness to support others, which has played a significant role in quickly and effectively solving key production technology problems. From New Year's Day to January 22, the masses raised 448 key problems, large and small, through large character posters at the Xuhui District Exhibition, of which 323 have been solved or linked up. The Shanghai Workers' Cultural Palace Exhibition organized a large-scale "key problem tackling day" for the mechanical and electrical industry, with the participation of 134 experienced advanced producers, veteran workers, and engineering technicians from the mechanical and electrical industry throughout the city. Within seven hours, this strong technical force tackled 44 key problems, including major technical key problems in the production of high, large, sophisticated, and cutting-edge products. When designing and manufacturing a major product urgently needed by the country, a design unit encountered a major key problem that the processing precision could not meet the requirements, and it could not be solved after visiting all major factories for several months; this time it was solved through mass consultation.

    Technological innovation and technological revolution exhibitions also have a clear ideological character, playing a major role in popularizing advanced ideas and promoting communist style. This exhibition, because it concentrates the essence of the creations of the masses throughout the city, most of the exhibits have the characteristics of being "local" and "simple" in appearance, but with very high production efficiency. It has given the audience a strong infection, prompting people to emancipate their minds, break superstitions, and establish a communist style of daring to think and daring to do. Many exhibitions also pay special attention to disseminating advanced ideas in the display of exhibits and explanations. For example, workers at the China Mineral Industry Raw Material Factory only spent one yuan to refit an electric scale, and the effect was better than a foreign automatic scale worth six thousand yuan. The exhibition displayed this simple exhibit in a prominent position, labeled with a clear explanation of "one yuan making revolution," and those who visited and studied were very enthusiastic and greatly inspired. The exhibition also set up a "model soldier hall" to prominently promote the touching deeds of advanced producers and advanced units. The various exchange activities of the exhibition also have both substance and form, not only promoting advanced experience, but also disseminating the advanced idea of continuous revolution. Because the exhibition has a clear ideological character, many factories have borrowed the east wind from the exhibition. When organizing workers to visit, they also adopted the method of combining virtuality and reality, on the one hand, "learning from the scriptures," and on the other hand, organizing discussions to seek virtuality, further breaking superstitions, emancipating the mind, and promoting the larger-scale development of the technological innovation movement in the factory. The role of the city's technological innovation and technological revolution exhibition is currently expanding.

    上海技术革新大交流大协作
    市、区和工厂大办展览会，促使技术革新普及、提高、再普及、再提高
    新华社上海14日电　记者张家炽报道：上海市为适应当前技术革新运动新的高潮，在全市范围内大办技术革新、技术革命展览会，广泛传播先进思想，展开技术革新大检阅、大交流、大协作。从元旦开始，有市和区的十九个展览会在全市二十三个场所展出，同时，各大工厂企业基层单位也广泛举办了展览会。市和区的展览会规模巨大，展出面积共达二万一千五百多平方米，拥有展品一万七千四百多件，几乎集中了全市各行各业最新最好的技术革新成就。一个多月来，展览会开展多种多样的群众性活动，成为全市职工群众迅速有效地学习交流先进经验的集中场所，和开展群众自我教育、发扬共产主义风格的生动活泼的学校，各行各业职工前往参观和参加活动的已达一百五十多万人次。大办展览会对技术革新起了很大的普及作用，同时也起了“普及——提高——再普及——再提高”的作用。
    上海市规模巨大的技术革新、技术革命展览会，是采取大搞群众运动的方法，依靠基层干部和群众举办的。因此，各个展览会不仅办得快，办得好，而且紧密地同工厂企业的技术革新、技术革命运动相结合，有力地促进运动的开展。市、区十九个展览会大多由基层单位自己推选展品，自己担任美工布置、讲解表演，因此几天内就筹备完毕，其中最短的只有三十六小时就公开展出。许多工厂企业的职工群众为了争取向展览会“献宝”，纷纷提前实现革新项目，使展览会的筹办过程成为发动群众、大搞技术革新的过程。黄浦区印刷业职工为了迎接展览会开幕，把全行业圆盘印刷机上的各种革新集中起来，创造了一种全新的十一项革新圆盘印刷机，使手工印刷全部机械化。许多行业和工厂纷纷组织职工群众向展览会“取经”、“献宝”，掀起了全行业的技术革新、技术革命高潮。黄浦区服装加工行业十七家工厂三千多职工，在三天之内就提出革新建议一万三千四百一十八条，实现二千二百六十四条，其中有二十多项革新被选入展览会。参观展览会后，职工们又取回来大量的先进经验，进一步大搞技术革新。展览会通过群众运动的方法来办，不但有力地推动工厂企业的技术革新高潮，也使展出内容更加丰富多采，真正成为全市最大的技术革新检阅场所。
    各个展览会在展出期间，综合应用了以往各种行之有效的推广、交流先进经验的活动方式，如举办专业交流会、现场表演会、赛刀会、学习班、讲座等等，快速、有效地普及了大量的先进经验，充分满足了职工群众学先进、赶先进的迫切要求。杨浦区展览会根据本区钳工手工操作多的特点，组织二百多个工厂的五百多个钳工，举行钳工操作机械化的专业交流会议。会议除组织参观革新展品之外，还由先进生产者和先进单位作口头讲解和操作表演，使到会的每个钳工学到了几件到十几件先进经验。徐汇区展览会发现车工们对展出的高速切削刀具、交流电火花磨刀机和老式车床改自动化等项目有很大的兴趣，就举办了三期车工学习班，专门传授这三种先进经验。学习班由老工人担任教师，对学员采取一看（看操作表演）、二讲（讲技术原理）、三发（发图纸资料）的教授方法，只两个晚上就使学员基本上掌握了这三种先进经验，车工们都称学习班是“多快好省的技术学校”。参加学习的八百三十多个车工毕业以后，不少人回厂把学到的经验再传授给别人，使先进经验遍地开花结果。许多展览会在接待一般观众时，也打破常规，不但详细讲解展品设计、用途，而且把展品拆给参观者看，让参观者画图、试验，尽量给参观者学习方便。
    展览会组织的各种便于群众学习、交流的活动，也对革新经验起了评比、总结和鉴定的作用。在杨浦区的钳工操作机械化交流会上大家介绍了几种万能划线机，经过群众评比，认为新业电工厂钳工金声明创造的一台有十大优点，生产效率最高，会议当场散发这种划线机的技术资料四百份。静安区展览会集中一百零八把先进车刀举行了“赛刀会”，结果有十二把车刀获得优胜，被确定为全区推广的先进车刀。
    开展群众性的生产、技术大协作，是展览会活动的一个重要的方面。所有展览会都设立协作馆、关键台、技术协作处，组织“门诊”、“会诊”、“急诊”、“攻关键活动日”、“攻关键会议”等活动。全市职工群众不但可在展览会上学习先进经验，也可把生产技术上的困难和关键问题拿到展览会上去要求协作解决。走进协作馆，到处是琳琅满目的大字报，有的是提出关键征求协作，有的是留下姓名、住址，表示愿意支援别人，对迅速切实地解决生产技术关键起了很大的作用。徐汇区展览会从元旦到1月22日，群众通过大字报提出大小关键四百四十八项，已解决或已挂钩的有三百二十三项。上海市工人文化宫展览会组织了一次规模很大的机电行业“攻关键活动日”，参加者有全市机电行业经验丰富的先进生产者、老工人和工程技术人员一百三十四人。这一支雄厚的技术力量，在七小时内就攻下四十四个关键，其中包括有生产高、大、精、尖产品中的重大技术关键问题。有一个设计单位在设计制造一项国家迫切需要的重大产品时，遇到了一个加工精密度达不到要求的重大关键，几个月来走遍所有大厂都不能解决；这次通过群众性的会诊，得到了解决的方案。
    技术革新、技术革命展览会还具有鲜明的思想性，对普及先进思想、发扬共产主义风格，起了很大的作用。这次展览会由于集中了全市群众创造的精华，大多数展品具有外貌虽“土”又“简”、而生产效率却很高的特色，因此给观众以强烈的感染，促使人们解放思想、破除迷信，树立敢想敢做的共产主义风格。许多展览会还特别注意在展品陈列和讲解说明中传播先进思想。例如，中国矿产工业原料厂的工人只花一块钱就改装好一台电动磅秤，效用比六千元一台的洋式自动磅秤还好。展览会把这个简陋的展品陈列在显著的地位，标以“一块钱闹革命”的鲜明说明，参观学习者非常踊跃，受到很大启发。展览会还设立“标兵馆”，突出地宣传先进生产者和先进单位的感人事迹。展览会的各种交流活动，也都有虚有实，既推广先进经验，又传播了不断革命的先进思想。由于展览会具有鲜明的思想性，许多工厂都向展览会大借东风。他们在组织职工参观时，也采取虚实并举的作法，一面“取经”，一面组织讨论务虚，进一步破除迷信，解放思想，促进本厂技术革新运动更大规模地开展。全市技术革新、技术革命展览会的作用，目前正在不断扩大中。
