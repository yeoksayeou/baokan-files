The fragrant Fuzhou, I arrived in this sunny city just in time for the blooming season of jasmine and magnolia. Strolling down the street, a subtle fragrance suddenly wafts by. It turns out that the trees along the road are full of starry, budding white magnolia blossoms. These flowers are sold by the piece by flower girls in Shanghai streets, but here they are densely packed on the branches of the trees along the street, almost within reach of passersby. Jasmine flowers are usually baked into scented tea and served as a beverage to the masses, but in this city, fresh jasmine flowers smile everywhere, their delicate and exquisite white blossoms are lovely. Fujian women, famous throughout the country for their amazing labor force, do not forget to adorn their hair with a fragrant flower when they work. Workers in the fragrance factories stand on bamboo ladders and skillfully toss the fragrant flowers into bamboo baskets beside them.

But Fuzhou is, after all, known for its abundance of banyan trees. I have never been to a city with so many banyan trees, several arm spans in girth and towering into the sky, in its streets and alleys. Few trees have brown beards hanging from their branches like banyan trees, with strings of aerial roots reaching the ground, and roots that twist and spread from the soil onto the ground. This kind of large tree is a poem in itself. It stands on the land, transcending the long river of time. People can read the chronicle of this city from the banyan tree’s trunk, covered with growth rings. The name "Banyan City" is also very elegant.

I had long heard about this ancient city located on the southeastern coast of the motherland. Because it faces the coastal defense frontier, it has left a deep impression on people for a long time. Although it is my first visit, it feels familiar: the world-renowned Fuzhou bodiless lacquerware, elegant Shoushan stone carvings, and exquisite wood carvings and arts and crafts. It is because of these traditional folk arts that Fuzhou has always brought a widespread impression to people. After the Opium War, it was opened as one of the "five treaty ports" by the imperialists, and a page of humiliation was written in this city for more than a century. There is also Lin Zexu, a famous general of the Qing Dynasty who burned opium and resisted British imperialism. Local residents can still point out his former residence and hand-written stone tablets for you, and so on.

But the most tempting are the subtropical fruit trees with the blazing southern colors.

Tempting fruit trees! When the direct train from Shanghai to Fuzhou passes Nanping, the train winds southeast along the picturesque Min River. The windows are filled with hills and fields, clusters and individual trees of lychee, longan, olive, and pomelo trees. These fruit trees are so fresh to everyone who visits for the first time. From the beginning, they come to my heart with a flash of inspiration, and then come to my daily life. Outside the window of my apartment, there are two longan trees. The luxuriant branches and leaves almost reach into the room. In August, the season when longans ripen, the numerous fruits on the trees attract children who hang around under the trees all day, waiting for a small, ripe fruit to fall on their heads by luck.

Such a veritable blessed land should be rich and prosperous. Who would have thought that it was a wasteland before liberation! Backwardness, poverty, and filth were full of disasters and misfortunes everywhere. It is said that there was a major flood almost every year. Knee-deep water and boats sailing on land were one of the portrayals of the urban area in those years. Except for a few Nantai residential areas for foreigners, the closely packed wooden houses in the city were dilapidated after years of disrepair, either becoming hunched or on the verge of collapse. When running water was still a luxury that hundreds of thousands of citizens could not reach, the fires over the years destroyed the lives and property of countless people. "Paper Fuzhou City" thus became a common saying. The most terrible plague epidemic, the plague and cholera, brought death to thousands of people. The city basically had no industrial base. A paper mill that produced two tons of crude newsprint a day and often stopped work, a few insignificant small match factories, and some symbolic so-called "machine factories," at most had a few pliers and a hand-cranked lathe for repairing machines. The Fuzhou bodiless lacquerware handicraft industry, which has a history of one hundred and fifty years, was almost dying and at a standstill on the eve of liberation. In addition, Fuzhou is located in a remote area and transportation is blocked. This city, known as the "blessed treasure city," has become a city of suffering full of devastation and poverty in the last few years under the rule of the reactionary regime.

When a cadre who went south with the army ten years ago told me these old things, I could hardly believe it. I had never been to this place before, and now I am here for the first time with a completely new feeling. Yes, in the past ten years, in this ancient city surrounded by mountains, evergreen all year round, and with constant flowers, the face of a new industrial city has emerged; through the Great Leap Forward of 1958, a vigorous leap has reached an unprecedented new height.

Talking about the industrial construction of this city from scratch, from small to large, is a pleasure, even if what can be listed in this short article is only a little bit of it. The most eloquent is the suburban area with its forest of chimneys. From the foot of the North Ridge to the banks of the Wulong River, from the side of the Datong Creek to Kuiqi Majiang, newly built factories and factory buildings are like the latest cultivated bright flowers blooming all over Fuzhou. In the past ten years, not only has the power industry, the papermaking industry, and the arts and crafts industry been greatly expanded, but also a series of modern industries with considerable scale have emerged, such as the recently established antibiotic industry and fragrance industry. Some of these industries are even worthy of being included in the ranks of the world's emerging industries.

Not long ago, I visited the large-scale Fuzhou No. 2 Bodiless Lacquerware Factory. The predecessor of this arts and crafts factory had only one worker left on the day of liberation. Now the factory has 970 employees. In the year of the Great Leap Forward, the total output value of the factory increased eighty times compared with the highest amount in the few years after liberation! Even such an industry as lacquerware manufacturing is now transitioning to semi-mechanized production.

Urban construction has also been put on the agenda long ago. First of all, the construction of the twenty-kilometer-long Minjiang River flood control embankment and a series of projects to dredge the sewers have freed residents from the threat of floods. More than sixty kilometers of tap water pipelines supply citizens with clean drinking water. There have been no cases of plague patients in the urban area since 1953. It is precisely on the former "Jindou Mountain" of Fuzhou, the most filthy pile of disorderly graves, that a workers' cultural palace with an area of 16,000 square meters has now appeared. Narrow and dilapidated wooden houses are disappearing year by year, and beautiful and spacious multi-story steel and concrete buildings are growing year by year. An eight-story overseas Chinese building will appear in the urban area of Fuzhou, like the exquisite houses in the overseas Chinese new village under Dameng Mountain, all of which are used to receive overseas Chinese returning from overseas to jointly participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. Under the leadership of the Party, the entire city is creating, one blueprint after another, one victory after another. People living in this city can feel the leaping pulse of her great strides forward.

I cannot forget the first glimpse at the station when I first arrived in Fuzhou. The temporary wooden shed station building, exuding the fresh smell of wood, shows that before the station building could be completed, the train from Shanghai to Fuzhou could not wait to be officially opened to traffic at the end of the year before last. Just think, how many people were ecstatic at the moment when the train that had been dreamed of for almost half a century before liberation arrived at the gate of Fuzhou!

Every holiday night, in the West Lake Park near my residence, from the carved beams and painted doors, all the way to a group of brand-new ivory-colored buildings in the Fujian Province Ten-Year Socialist Construction Exhibition Hall, the tips of the tree branches are decorated with strings of colorful lights, and the lights are reflected in the water, forming a charming realm. Suddenly, fireworks rose in the cloudless night sky, fireworks sparkling, illuminating the distant shadows of the surrounding mountains, and also illuminating the crowded and happy crowds on the lakeside, colorful and dazzling, it is really a spring garden!

Oh, Fuzhou! Today, only today, in the hands of the people, do you truly radiate the brilliance of a blessed treasure city, and you will move towards a more glorious and brilliant future with the continued leap forward.

### 榕城春色
何为

    榕城春色
    何为
    花香袭人的福州，我来到这个阳光明媚的城市刚好是在茉莉和玉兰盛开的季节。在街上漫步，蓦地一阵暗香浮动，原来道旁的树上全是星星点点绽开的白兰花蓓蕾。这种花在上海街头的卖花女手中是论朵计值的，可是在这儿却是繁花压枝密密匝匝的满长在沿街的树上，行人路过几乎伸手可触。茉莉花通常是焙制成香片，作为一种饮料来到广大的人们手中，然而在这个城市里，新鲜的茉莉花到处灿然微笑，剔透玲珑的白色小朵令人喜爱。以惊人的劳动力名闻全国的福建妇女在劳动时没有忘记在发髻间簪上一朵香花。那些香精厂里的工人站在竹梯上用熟练的动作把香花投入身旁竹筐里。
    但福州毕竟是以榕树众多著称。我从来没有到过一个城市，城市里的大街小巷会有那么多腰围数抱高可参天的榕树。很少有一种树像榕树一样在枝柯间飘垂着褐色的大胡子，成串成串的须根长可及地，树根又从泥土里虬结盘错的伸展到地面上。这种大树本身就是一首诗，它越过时间的长河，屹立在土地上，人们可以从布满年轮的榕树树身上读到这个城市的编年史，榕城这个称号也是十分雅致的。
    早就听人介绍过这个座落在祖国东南海滨的古城了。因为面临海防前线更使人长久以来就产生深刻的印象。虽是初见，却又似曾相识：举世闻名的福州脱胎漆器，典雅的寿山石刻和精巧的木雕工艺美术品，正是因为这些传统的民间艺术，使福州这个城市一直给人带来广泛的印象。鸦片战争后这里被帝国主义辟为“五口通商”的口岸之一，一百多年来在这个城市写下了屈辱的一页。还有焚毁鸦片抗击英帝国主义者的清朝名将林则徐，当地居民至今还能为你指点他的故居和手书石碑等等。
    然而最诱人的还是那些带着炎炎的南国色彩的亚热带果树。
    诱人的果树！当上海到福州直达火车过了南平，列车沿着山明水秀的闽江向东南方蜿蜒行进时，车窗外漫山遍野一丛丛一棵棵全是荔枝树、龙眼树、橄榄树和柚子树，这些果树对每一个初次来访的人是如此新鲜，它一开始就带着灵感的闪光来到我的心中，接着来到我的日常生活中。我的寓所楼窗外种着两棵龙眼树，纷披的枝叶几乎要探身入室。8月，龙眼成熟的季节，树上出现的累累果实招致孩子们成天在树下打转，等待着一个小小的成熟的果实幸运地掉在头上。
    这样一块名副其实的福地上，应该是富裕而且繁荣的，谁能想到解放前却是一片荒芜！落后、贫困和肮脏，到处充满了灾难与祸患。据说那时候没有一年不发大水，水深及膝、陆地行舟是当年市区的写照之一。除了少数供洋人享用的南台住宅区以外，城内栉比鳞次的木屋年久失修，不是变得伛偻就是濒于倾圮。当自来水还是几十万市民难以企及的奢望时，历年火灾不知使多少人的生命财产毁于一旦。“纸褙福州城”于是就成为人们的一句口头禅。最可怕的疫疠流行，鼠疫和霍乱给成千上万的人带来了死亡。全市根本谈不到工业基础，一座日产两吨粗报纸并且经常停工的纸厂，几个微不足道的小火柴厂，此外还有一些象征性的所谓“机器厂”，充其量只有几把老虎钳和一部手摇车床用来修配机器而已。有一百五十年历史的福州脱胎漆器手工业，在解放前夕几乎奄奄一息陷于停顿。加以福州地处偏僻，交通阻塞，这个素有“福地宝城”之称的城市，在反动政权统治下的最后几年已成为满目疮痍民不聊生的苦难之城。
    当一个十年前随军南下的干部告诉我这些旧事的时候，我几乎难以置信。以前我从未到过这个地方，现在我是带着全新的感觉第一次来到这里。是的，十年来，在这个丛山环抱四季常绿繁花不断的古老的城市里，一个新兴的工业城市的面貌已经显露出来；通过1958年的大跃进，奋力一跃又达到前所未有的新的高度。
    谈谈这个城市从无到有从小到大的工业建设是一种愉快，哪怕这篇小文里所能列举的仅仅只是其中的一点一滴。最雄辩的是郊区烟囱林立，从北岭之麓到乌龙江畔，从大同溪旁至魁岐马江，一座座新建的工厂厂房，如同一朵朵最新栽培的鲜艳的花朵开遍了福州。十年中间，不仅大大扩展了电力工业、造纸工业和工艺美术工业，而且出现了具有相当规模的一系列现代工业，如像最近建立的抗生素工业和芳香工业，这些工业有的即使列入世界新兴工业的行列也毫无愧色。
    不久前我参观了规模巨大的福州第二脱胎漆器厂。这个工艺美术厂的前身在解放那一天只剩下一个工人，现在全厂有九百七十个职工，大跃进的一年间全厂产值比解放后几年最高额又增长八十倍！甚至于像这样一项制造漆器的行业，现在也过渡到半机械化生产了。
    城市建设也早已推到日程上。首先是修建二十公里长的闽江防洪堤和疏浚下水道的一系列工程使居民从此可以免于洪水之患。六十多公里长的自来水水道管供给市民清洁的饮水。早在1953年市区内就没有出现过鼠疫病患者。正是在昔日福州最肮脏的“金斗山”乱坟堆之上，如今出现了方圆一万六千平方米的工人文化宫。湫溢简陋的木屋逐年在消失，漂亮宽广的多层钢骨水泥建筑逐年在增长。在福州市区将出现一座八层楼的华侨大厦，和大梦山下的华侨新村一幢幢精致的住宅一样，都是用来接待从海外归来的华侨共同参加祖国社会主义大建设的。在党的领导下，整个城市在创造，一张蓝图接着一张蓝图，一个胜利接着一个胜利，生活在这个城市的人能够感觉到她大踏步前进中跳跃的脉搏。
    我不能忘记初到福州时在车站上的最初一瞥。散发着新鲜木材香味的临时木棚站舍，说明在车站大楼还来不及建成时，从上海直达福州的火车就迫不及待地在前年年底提前正式通车。只要想想，解放前梦寐以求向往了足足快近半个世纪的火车开到福州大门前的一刹那，有多少人为之欣喜若狂啊！
    每逢节日的夜晚，就在我住处近旁的西湖公园里，从雕梁画栋的大门口，一直到规模宏大的福建省十年社会主义建设展览馆一组崭新的象牙色建筑物面前，树枝梢头缀满了成串的彩灯，灯光倒映在水里，形成了一个迷人的境界。蓦地，万里无云的夜空升起了朵朵焰火，礼花闪耀，照耀着四周群山的远影，也照耀着湖畔挤挤挨挨欢乐的人群，五彩缤纷，目不暇接，真个是春色满园！
　　哦，福州！今天，只有今天，在人民手里，你才真正发出福地宝城的光辉，并且将随着继续跃进的步伐，走向更加光辉灿烂的未来。
