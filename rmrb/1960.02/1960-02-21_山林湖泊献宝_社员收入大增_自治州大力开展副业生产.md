    Mountains, Forests, and Lakes Offer Treasures: Commune Members' Income Greatly Increases
    Autonomous Prefecture Vigorously Develops Sideline Production
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province is fully leveraging the power of the people's communes, implementing the policy of "livestock breeding as the main focus, combining agriculture and livestock, and developing diversified operations," and vigorously developing sideline production, calling on the mountains, forests, and lakes to offer treasures. In 1959, the prefecture collected more than 7,190,000 *jin* of Chinese medicinal materials such as rhubarb, fritillary bulbs, and caterpillar fungus; dug more than 2,175,000 *jin* of ginseng fruit (fern rhizomes); hunted more than 1,469,000 *jin* of various kinds of wild animal meat; and caught more than 40,000 *jin* of *Huang* fish, several to more than ten times higher than the highest annual output in history. All twenty-seven communes and one hundred and fifty-four production teams in the prefecture have greatly increased their income, with an average annual income of around 300 *yuan* per laborer.
    The Guoluo grasslands are not only a good natural pasture but also harbor many rare birds and animals and grow precious wild plants in the vast mountains, forests, and lakes. Before liberation, the cruel rule of feudal headmen and reactionary herdowners kept the Guoluo area in a backward state of simple animal husbandry economy. After liberation, especially after communization, in addition to strengthening animal husbandry and the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, each commune emphasized the development of abundant resources and organized sideline production. At the beginning of last year, the Guoluo Prefecture Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a call to the people of the prefecture to "advance into the mountains, forests, and lakes and develop diversified operations," and conducted specific research and arrangements for this work, regarding it as one of the main means of increasing commune members' income. Cheng Jianmin, First Secretary of the Guoluo Prefecture Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, personally went to the mountains to survey rhubarb resources. County Party Secretaries and Commune Party Committee Secretaries took the lead, leading commune members to extract wealth from the mountains, forests, and lakes. Each commune rationally arranged labor, and on the premise of ensuring the continuous leap forward in pastoral and agricultural production, established specialized sideline production teams. At the same time, commercial departments strengthened the purchase of local and special products, going deep into various production sites or door-to-door to purchase, and transportation departments mobilized transportation forces so that products could be transported in a timely manner.
    In the movement to "call on the mountains, forests, and lakes to offer treasures," the communes in various places fully explained the significance of developing sideline production to the commune members, properly organized the labor force, and strengthened the leadership in improving technology and reforming tools. Production efficiency continued to increase, production records were refreshed daily, and advanced figures continued to emerge. Kai Que, a member of the Dari River Commune in Dari County, once dug 3,582 *jin* of rhubarb in one day; Wo Zhong, a commune member, dug 40 *jin* of fern rhizomes in one day; Wang Cuo, a female commune member of the Dawu Commune in Maqin County, dug 435 *jin* of Kansui in one day. These high-yield records broke the commune's production quota by twenty to thirty-five times.
    Communes have generally increased their income, and the lives of commune members have also improved significantly. In addition to meat, milk, and ghee for consumption, the average pastoralist ate about 200 *jin* of grain last year. Taking the Dangxiang Commune in Maqin County as an example, the commune members are not only well-fed and well-clothed, but 30% of them have new fur coats, 50% have new boots, and 100% have new hats. They happily sang while working: "Well-fed, well-clothed, the winter on the grasslands is like spring, a happy life is as sweet as honey." (Attached picture)
    Medical and health institutions have been generally established in the Guoluo area, and a number of medical personnel have been trained. Xi Mao, who used to be a herder, is now a health worker in the People's Commune. (Supplied by *Minzu Huabao* [National Pictorial])

### 山林湖泊献宝　社员收入大增  自治州大力开展副业生产

    山林湖泊献宝　社员收入大增
    自治州大力开展副业生产
    本报讯　青海果洛藏族自治州充分发挥人民公社的强大威力，贯彻“以牧为主，农牧结合，发展多种经营”的方针，大力开展副业生产，叫山林湖泊献宝。1959年中，全州共采挖大黄、贝母、冬虫草等中药材七百一十九万多斤，挖人参果（蕨麻）二百一十七万五千多斤，猎取各类野牲肉一百四十六万九千多斤，捕捞湟鱼四万多斤，比历史上最高年产量还高几倍到十几倍。全州二十七个公社、一百五十四个生产队都大大增加了收入，每个劳动力全年平均收入在三百元左右。
    果洛草原不仅是个天然好牧场，而且在广大的山林湖泊里栖息着许多珍禽异兽和生长着名贵的野生植物。解放以前，封建头人和反动牧主的残酷统治，使果洛地区一直处于落后的单纯畜牧业经济的境地。解放后，特别是公社化以后，各公社除了加强畜牧业和农牧结合以外，还强调了开发丰富的资源，组织副业生产。去年年初，中共果洛州委向全州人民发出“向山林湖泊进军、发展多种经营”的号召，并对这一工作进行了具体研究和安排，当作增加社员收入的主要手段之一。中共果洛州委第一书记程建民同志亲自上山勘察大黄资源，县委书记、公社党委书记挂帅，带领社员向山林湖泊索取财富。每个公社都合理安排了劳力，在保证牧农业生产不断跃进的前提下，成立了副业专业生产队。与此同时，商业部门加强了土特产品的收购工作，深入各个生产工地或挨门串户收购，运输部门调动运输力量，使产品能够及时调运。
    各地公社在开展“叫山林湖泊献宝”的运动中，都向社员充分说明了发展副业生产的意义，妥善地组织了劳力，并加强了对改进技术和改革工具的领导，生产效率不断提高，生产纪录日日刷新，先进人物不断涌现。达日县达日河公社社员开却有一天曾经挖大黄三千五百八十二斤，社员窝中有一天挖蕨麻四十斤，玛沁县大武公社女社员王措一天挖了甘遂四百三十五斤，这些高产纪录，都突破了公社生产定额二十倍到三十五倍。
    公社普遍增加了收入，社员生活也随着显著改善，劳动牧民除了有肉、奶、酥油等食用以外，去年平均每人吃到了二百斤左右的粮食。以玛沁县党项公社为例，社员目前不仅吃饱穿暖有余，而且有30％的人穿上了新皮袄，50％的人换上了新靴子，百分之百的人戴上了新帽子。他们一边劳动一边欢乐地唱道：“吃得饱，穿得暖，草原冬天像春天，幸福生活蜜样甜。”（附图片）
    果洛地区已普遍设立了医疗卫生机构，并且培养出一批医务人员。原来是牧民的西毛，现在是人民公社的卫生员　（民族画报供稿）
