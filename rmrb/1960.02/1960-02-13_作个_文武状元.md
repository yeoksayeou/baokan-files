    Strive to be a "Civil and Military状元"
    Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, tens of thousands of "状元" have emerged in all walks of life. Under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, these "状元" have put politics in command, given priority to ideology, exerted full effort, and broken through every "barrier," playing a pioneering role of "opening roads through mountains and building bridges across rivers."
    However, we must further master Marxist-Leninist theory and scientific knowledge to better serve as a "Civil and Military 状元". In the old society, our working class not only couldn't learn theory or culture but couldn't even find work. After liberation, under the kind instruction of the Party and Chairman Mao, we learned culture, initially grasped scientific knowledge, and improved our political consciousness. Only then did we make significant progress in technology and achieved many victories for the Party and the people on the production front. However, if we want to do more for the Party and the people and achieve greater merits, we must better study Chairman Mao's writings and scientific theoretical knowledge and comprehensively improve ourselves a step further. Now, various factories and mines are consolidating and establishing spare-time universities, middle schools, secondary technical schools, and primary schools. Our working class should become the vanguard on this learning front, earnestly studying Chairman Mao's works and scientific theoretical knowledge, crossing the cultural barrier, ascending to a higher level, and striving to be an even more outstanding "Civil and Military 状元".

### 作个“文武状元”

    作个“文武状元”
    从1958年大跃进以来，各行各业都出现了数以万计的“状元”。这些“状元”在总路线的光辉照耀下，政治挂帅，思想先行，鼓足干劲，有“关”必破，起到了“遇山开路，遇河架桥”的先锋作用。
    但是，我们还必须进一步掌握马克思列宁主义理论和科学知识，才能更好地做一个“文武状元”。我们工人阶级在旧社会不但不能学理论学文化，就是连工作也找不到。解放后，在党和毛主席的亲切教导下，才学到了文化，初步掌握了科学知识，而且提高了政治觉悟，才在技术上有了突飞猛进的进步，在生产战线上为党为人民立了不少战功。但是，我们要想为党为人民作更多的事，立更大的功，就必须更好地学习毛主席的著作和科学理论知识，把自己全面地提高一步。现在各个厂矿正在巩固与成立业余大学、中学、中等技术学校和小学，我们工人阶级应该成为这个学习战线上的尖兵，认真的学习毛主席著作和科学理论知识，跃过文化关，更上一层楼，力争做一个更加出色的文武双全的状元。
