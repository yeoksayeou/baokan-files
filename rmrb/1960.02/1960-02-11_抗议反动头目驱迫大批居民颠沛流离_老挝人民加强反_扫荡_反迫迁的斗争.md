Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 9th: The "Lao Patriotic News," published on January 26th, reported that during January, the heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" in Laos, while carrying out a large-scale "mopping-up" operation against the Lao people, intensified their brutal forced concentration of residents.

　　In Muong Ngan, commanders of the Lao Royal Army ordered soldiers to coerce the people into relocating with guns and buried landmines and hung hand grenades in civilian houses to intimidate people who wanted to return home. At the same time, they also ordered the people of Phu Chao, Phu Chong and other places to move to places near the roadside in order to facilitate their surveillance of the local people and abduction of laborers.

　　In Phong Saly, the heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" viciously instigated one ethnic group to massacre another, and also implemented the segregation of ethnic groups by area.

　　In Luang Prabang, they concentrated the people of Ban Sa village around the Ban Sa stronghold. The Miao people of Phu Chong and other places were driven to the banks of the Nam Ou River, and the Liao Lun people who lived thirty or forty miles away from Luang Prabang city were also forced to move to the town. In Sam Neua Province, the Miao people in various villages on the highlands on the left bank of the Ou River were forced to move to the right bank.

　　"Lao Patriotic News" pointed out that the above facts prove that the reactionary chiefs of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" are carrying out large-scale forced relocation activities in a planned manner, forcing thousands of families into displacement, away from the land they have relied on for generations. This brutality has aroused the boundless anger of the Lao people. Now the people in various places are more firmly carrying out the struggle against "mopping-up" and forced relocation.

    抗议反动头目驱迫大批居民颠沛流离
    老挝人民加强反“扫荡”反迫迁的斗争
    新华社河内9日电　1月26日出版的“老挝爱国新闻”报道：今年1月间，老挝“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们在对老挝人民大肆进行“扫荡”的同时，加紧残暴地强迫居民集中。
    在芒银，老挝王国军队的指挥官命令士兵们用枪胁迫老百姓迁居，并且在民房里埋下地雷，挂起手榴弹，威吓要求回家的人民。同时，他们还命令富巢、富冲等地的人民搬到靠近路边的地方居住，以便于他们监视当地人民和拉夫抓丁。
    在丰沙里，“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们恶毒地唆使一个民族去惨杀另一个民族，还施行各民族分区聚居。
    在琅勃拉邦，他们把本车乡的老百姓集中到本车据点周围居住。富冲等地的苗族人民被驱逐到南乌江畔，远离琅勃拉邦市三四十里居住的辽伦族也被迫迁到市镇里居住。在桑怒省，乌江左岸高地各乡的苗族人民被迫迁到右岸居住。
    “老挝爱国新闻”指出，上述事实证明，“保卫国家利益委员会”的反动头目正在有计划地进行大规模的迫迁活动，逼迫成千个家庭颠沛流离，离开他们世世代代赖以生存的土地。这种暴行激起了老挝人民的无比愤怒。现在各地人民正在更加坚决地进行反“扫荡”和反迫迁的斗争。
