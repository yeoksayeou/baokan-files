    Reported by our newspaper: The Jinsha Brigade of Langqi Commune in Minhou County, Fujian Province, has been vigorously reclaiming the seashore, doubling the brigade's cultivated land area and greatly increasing total grain output. Currently, the brigade members are advancing victoriously, determined to seize another eight thousand mu of farmland from the sea.
    The Jinsha Brigade is located at the southern end of Langqi Island in Minhou County, and its natural conditions are extremely harsh. Starting in 1952, the masses here organized two large-scale reclamation projects, building two dikes totaling twenty li in length on the seashore, reclaiming 1,900 mu of land. Including the 600-plus mu reclaimed last year, the cultivated land area has been expanded by more than 2,500 mu, doubling the total cultivated area in 1949. This reclaimed land has now become fertile fields yielding two crops of sweet potatoes and wheat per year. In 1959 alone, the grain produced from the reclaimed land was equal to three times the total grain output of the entire village before liberation, accounting for more than 60% of the total annual grain output. In 1959, the original cultivated land plus the reclaimed land yielded more than 5,880,000 jin of grain, an increase of 44.8% over the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, and six times the total grain output of 840,000 jin in 1949. Due to the annual increase in grain production, the brigade went from being grain-deficient to having a surplus starting in 1956, and in 1959, it sold 1,950,000 jin of grain to the state.
    The masses of the Jinsha Brigade demonstrated soaring revolutionary enthusiasm in the reclamation of the seashore. Under the leadership of the Party, they pooled their wisdom and efforts, relied on their own strength, and relied on the collective to wrest land from the sea. The Party branch relied on the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, establishing the ambitious goal of "reclaiming farmland without spending a penny of the state's money" among the masses. They adopted the method of "promoting thrift through diligence, using indigenous methods instead of foreign ones, and learning while doing," successfully solving difficulties such as the lack of funds, technology, and equipment. The two reclamation projects cost a total of only 4,900 yuan, relying entirely on the masses to solve the problems themselves. The 3,000 yuan in equipment funds subsidized by the state were not used at all, and were returned to the state in full after the project was completed.
    While completing the reclamation project, the Jinsha Brigade also put forward the slogan "reclaim a piece, improve a piece, and achieve high yields in every piece," continuously improving the soil year after year, resulting in a constant increase in yield per unit area. In the winter of 1958, under the unified leadership of the commune, this brigade concentrated a group of strong laborers to brave the severe cold to repair the dikes, universally raising the previously newly built twenty-li-long seawall by two meters and thickening it by three meters. Stone slabs were also laid on the outside of the dike to prevent tides and protect the soil, achieving standardization of the seawall.
    In the spring of 1959, the entire brigade mobilized a large number of laborers to carry out high-standard soil improvement on the newly reclaimed land. For low-lying land, approximately 1,000 dan of soil were added per mu, and for land with excessively coarse soil, more than 500 dan of sand were added per mu. In order to prevent seawater from seeping in and causing saline damage, the Party branch also led the commune members in digging more than 300 saline drainage ditches. After such comprehensive transformation, the soil quality of the newly reclaimed land underwent great changes, and the yield per unit area significantly increased.
    Through several years of heroic struggle and vigorous reclamation, the Jinsha Brigade has transformed from poor to rich. However, they are not satisfied with the achievements they have already made. Recently, they mobilized more than 950 commune members, worked hard for more than half a month, and completed the construction of a new third seawall, which is seven li long. They are determined to complete the fourth seawall project before the spring plowing. After the completion of this project, the cultivated land area can be expanded by 8,000 mu, which is about twice as much as the original cultivated land area of the entire brigade.

    向大海再夺取八千亩良田
    金砂大队围垦海滩耕地扩大一倍粮食连年增加
    本报讯　福建省闽侯县琅岐公社金砂大队大搞海滩围垦，使全队耕地面积扩大一倍，粮食总产量大大增加。目前全队社员正乘胜前进，决心向大海再夺八千亩良田。
    金砂大队位于闽侯县琅岐岛的南端，自然条件极为恶劣。从1952年开始，这里的群众先后组织两次大规模围垦，在海滩上筑起了两座长达二十里的堤坝，围垦海滩一千九百亩。加上去年围垦的六百多亩，共扩大耕地面积二千五百多亩，比1949年耕地总面积扩大了一倍。这些围垦的土地现已成为薯麦两熟的肥沃田园。1959年单是围垦耕地所产的粮食，就等于解放前全村粮食总产量的三倍，占全年粮食总产量的60％强。1959年，原有的耕地加上围垦的土地，共收粮食五百八十八万多斤，比大跃进的1958年增产44．8％，比1949年粮食总产量八十四万斤增加六倍。由于粮食年年增产，从1956年开始，变缺粮为余粮，1959年还卖给国家一百九十五万斤粮。
    金砂大队的群众在围垦海滩中表现了冲天的革命干劲。他们在党的领导下，群策群力，自力更生，依靠集体力量，向海争地。党支部依靠广大的贫农、下中农，在群众中树立起“不花国家一分钱，大搞围垦造良田”的雄心壮志。他们采用“以勤促俭、以土代洋、边学边作”的办法，顺利地解决了缺乏资金、技术和器材等困难。两次围垦工程一共只花资金四千九百元，完全依靠群众自己解决。国家补助他们的三千元器材费，一文没有动用，工程结束后如数还给了国家。
    金砂大队在完成围垦工程的同时，还提出“围一片、改一片，实现片片高产”的口号，连年大搞改良土壤，使单位面积产量不断提高。1958年冬天，这个大队在公社统一领导下，集中了一批强壮劳力冒严寒修堤，把过去新建二十里长的海堤普遍加高二米、培厚三米，堤外还铺上石板，以防潮保土，作到了海堤标准化。
    1959年春天，全队又出动了大批劳力对新围垦的土地进行高标准的改良土壤，凡是地势低洼的土地，每亩都加上土一千担左右，土质太粗的土地，每亩加沙五百担以上。为了防止海潮浸透，发生咸害，党支部还领导社员挖了排咸沙渠三百多条。经过这样全面改造后，新围垦的土地的土质起了很大变化，单位产量显著提高。
    经过几年来的英勇奋战，大搞围垦，金砂大队已由穷变富了。但他们并不满足已经取得的成就，最近他们出动了九百五十多个社员，大干半个多月，完成了一座长达七里的第三道海堤的新建工程，并决心在春耕前完成第四道海堤工程。这个工程完工后可扩大耕地面积八千亩，比全大队原有的耕地面积还多一倍左右。
