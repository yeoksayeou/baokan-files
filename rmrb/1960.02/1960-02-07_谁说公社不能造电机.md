Who Says Communes Can't Build Electric Motors?
By our reporters Lu Xiaoping and Hao Jian

These days, if you take a trip to Xindian People's Commune in Xinzheng County, Henan Province, you'll hear commune members everywhere discussing their newly established rural power stations with beaming faces.

When night falls, if you stand on high and look down, you'll find the commune lit up with twinkling electric lights, like a sky full of stars. Now, almost every production brigade has established a small power station.

Why has the electrical industry in Xindian Commune developed so quickly? If you ask about this, people will tell you, "We've forced the duck onto the perch!"

At the beginning of last year, the Xinzheng County Committee issued a call to mobilize the masses to build power stations. The Xindian Commune began to consider building its own power stations. At the time, some people didn't think it was possible. They said, "Our machinery factory has no equipment, no technology, and no raw materials. How can we build a power station and make electric motors?" "If a rabbit can pull a cart, who would still feed a big ox?" "This is forcing a duck onto the perch; it's simply impossible!"

"Who says a duck can't be forced onto the perch? We're going to build our own electric motors and power stations!" This was the thinking of the majority of people. One day, the county learned that the Hongqi Machinery Factory in Changge County had made an indigenous generator and wanted the Xindian Commune Machinery Factory to send people to learn. The commune immediately sent young worker Zhao Futang, carpenter Li Desan, and Dong Fuyuan, the director of the Xindian Post and Telecommunications Office who had served as a telephone platoon leader in the army, to study. As soon as they arrived at the Hongqi Machinery Factory, they saw a small, indigenous generator in the yard. They walked over and fiddled with it for a long time, but still couldn't figure out how it worked. At that time, the factory director sent a technician to explain it to them. The technician came with a small blackboard and explained the construction of the motor while drawing on it. At first, they all took out notebooks, planning to take careful notes. However, the more they listened, the more confused they became. The blackboard was covered with English letters, and he talked about volts, kilowatts, amperes, and so on. The more they listened, the less they understood.

Could a "duck" really be forced onto the perch? This question lingered in people's minds again.

Later, everyone discussed it and decided: If we can't understand what the technician is saying, let's find the workers! The next morning, the three of them went to the workshop and helped the veteran workers with this and that, and soon they became friends. When the workers learned of their intentions, they took various parts and explained the structure of the motor to them. It sounded clear and practical. Zhao Futang ran to the street to buy some kraft paper and copied the stator, rotor, and other motor parts according to the pattern. After returning to Xindian Commune, they immediately started trial production. If they didn't have copper wire, they extracted it from the scrap copper turned in by the masses. If they didn't have yarn-covering machines, they created their own indigenous yarn-covering machine. To make the stator, they needed a lathe, so they converted a broken Liberation-brand waterwheel frame. In this way, while making equipment, they also engaged in manufacturing, and finally made the parts and components for the first generator.

The parts and components were all made, but how to put them together to form a generator? This was a big problem. The stator alone required twenty-four coils of copper wire, totaling more than 190 feet in length, with forty-eight wire ends in the middle. If one wire end was connected incorrectly, the motor would not generate electricity. Zhao Futang and Dong Fuyuan spent four days and four nights assembling and reassembling, but two coils of wire could not be installed. Later, even after the wire was installed, the ends were connected incorrectly. But they had a determination: "We must assemble the generator!" After repeated discussions, they came up with a method of hanging tags on the wire ends. When installing the wires, one person read the number, and the other connected the end. After connecting, they immediately tested it with a compass. Finally, the compass needle started to move wildly! The generator was successfully made!

"The duck is really on the perch!" People from various production brigades in the commune came to visit the generator in an endless stream. Commune members voluntarily raised materials needed to make electric motors. Some old women took out copper coins and copper plates that had been stored for decades, some old men took off their tobacco pipe mouthpieces, and others brought white iron sheets for making stovepipes. In less than two days, all the production brigades sent people to the commune's machinery factory to learn how to make electric motors. In this way, in just over two months, Xindian Commune produced thirty-seven small generators and installed them in the commune's reservoirs and canals. Now, if you go to Xindian Commune, you can see installation workers installing light fixtures and connecting lines everywhere, whether it is in factories, schools, canteens, or feeding farms. Transmission lines are spreading out in all directions.

Now, the generators shipped out from the Xindian Commune Machinery Factory are not only 5-kilowatt ones, but also 25-kilowatt ones. The 48-kilowatt and 75-kilowatt ones are also being rushed to completion.

The "duck" is not only on the perch, but is also developing rapidly from small to large, from indigenous to modern.

    谁说公社不能造电机
    本报记者　陆笑萍　郝健
    这些日子，你要是去河南新郑县辛店人民公社走一遭，到处可以听到社员们怀着乐滋滋的心情，议论着他们新办起来的农村电站。
    当夜幕降临的时候，你站到高处往下一望，就会发现公社到处是闪烁的电灯光，就像是布满星星的天空一样。现在，差不多每个生产大队都建立了小型电站。
    辛店公社的电气事业为什么发展得这样快呢？你要是问起这件事来，人们就会告诉你：“咱们的鸭子上架了！”
    去年年初，新郑县委提出了发动群众办电的号召，辛店公社就开始盘算着自己动手办电站的事。当时，有的人可不以为然。他们说：“咱机械厂一无设备，二无技术，三无原材料还能办电站，造电机？”“小兔子能拉车谁还喂大黄牛？”“这是打着鸭子上架，根本办不到的事！”
    “谁说鸭子不能上架，咱们就要自己动手造电机，办电站！”这是大多数人的心思。一天，县里打听到长葛县红旗机械厂制成了一部土发电机，要辛店公社机械厂派人去学习。公社立即派了青年工人赵福堂、木工李得三和在部队上当过电话排长的辛店邮电所长董福元去学习。刚一到红旗机械厂，他们就看见院里放着一部小型土发电机，走去翻过来，调过去地摆弄了半天，还是没有看出个眉眼。当时厂长派了一位技术员来给他们讲解。技术员来了，手里提着一个小黑板，一边画一边给他们解释电机构造。开初，他们都掏出笔记本来打算用心做笔记。可是，听下去就越听越傻了眼，黑板上写的都是些英文字母，讲的尽是些伏特、瓩、安倍等等。越听越不懂。
    “鸭子”果真也能上架么？这个问题，又在人们的脑子里萦回起来。
    后来，大伙一合计：咱们听不懂技术员讲找工人去！第二天一早，他们三人就跑到车间里，帮助老工人摆弄这，摆弄那，很快就和老工人交上了朋友。工人们知道他们的来意后，就拿着各种零件给他们讲电机构造，听起来又清楚，又实在。赵福堂拔腿跑到街上去买了几张牛皮纸，回来依葫芦画瓢地照着样子把定子、转子等各种电机部件画了下来。回到辛店公社以后，他们立刻就开始了试制工作。没有铜线，他们就自己动手把群众交来的碎铜拔成铜线，没有沙包线他们就自己创造一部土包沙机。做定子要车床，他们就用破了的解放式水车架子改装了一部。就这样，一边造设备，一边搞制造，终于把第一部发电机的零件和部件都做了出来。
    零件和部件都做出来了，可是怎么把它们装在一块，组成发电机呢？这却是个大难题。光是定子里面就要装二十四盘铜线，共长一百九十多丈，中间有四十八个线头，要是接错一个头，电机就不能发电。赵福堂和董福元整整花了四天四夜时间，装去装来总有两盘线装不进去，后来线装进了头又接错了。但是，他们有一个决心：“一定要装好发电机”！经过反复讨论，他们想出了在线头上挂牌子的办法，装线时一个人念号，一个人接头，接完后立刻用指南针试验，终于指南针头乱动起来了！发电机制成功了！
    “鸭子真的上架了！”公社里各生产大队来参观发电机的人络绎不绝。社员们纷纷自动筹集造电机需用的材料，有的老大娘把存放了几十年的铜钱、铜板拿出来，有的老大爷把自己的烟袋嘴子摘下来了，有的又把做烟筒的白铁皮送来了。没两天工夫，各生产大队都派人到公社机械厂来学习制造电机。就这样，辛店公社在两个来月的时间内，制出了三十七部小型发电机，在公社的水库、渠道上安装起来。如今，如果你到辛店公社去，无论是工厂、学校、食堂、饲养场里都可以看到安装工人在安装灯头，牵接线路。输电线正向四方八面伸展开去。
    现在，辛店公社机械厂里运出去的发电机，不仅有五瓩的，还有二十五瓩的。四十八瓩和七十五瓩的也正在加紧赶造。
    “鸭子”不但上架了，而且正在由小到大，由土到洋地迅速发展着。
