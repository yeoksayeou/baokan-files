Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 11th. Our reporters Fang Chen and Huang Jun report: Since the beginning of 1960, the technological innovation and revolution movement on the industrial front in Hebei Province has entered a new stage. More than one million workers across the province have launched an unprecedented mechanization and semi-mechanization movement; some enterprises with the necessary conditions have begun to advance rapidly towards automation and semi-automation. In January alone, workers across the province proposed 470,000 innovation suggestions, an increase of 1.2 times compared to the same period last year, of which 145,000 have already been implemented.

The widespread development of the technological innovation and revolution movement is changing the face of industrial enterprises in Hebei Province with each passing day. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in many regions, industries, and enterprises is rapidly increasing. In a very short period, Tianjin increased its level of mechanization and semi-mechanization from the original 43% to over 52%. In less than a month, all 25 modern large-scale coal mines in the province basically achieved mechanized coal digging, freeing more than 10,000 coal digging workers from their shovels. In January, Handan Prefecture achieved mechanization of over 85% of ore crushing in its small and medium-sized blast furnaces. Many modern large-scale enterprises with a high degree of mechanization are also moving towards automation and semi-automation at a rapid pace. The improvement of mechanization has significantly increased labor productivity and ensured a large-scale, sustained high yield in production. Industrial enterprises across the province achieved a "flying start" in January.

The basic experiences of Hebei Province in developing the technological innovation and revolution movement so rapidly and widely with such significant results are: first, starting from reality, formulating plans at all levels, solving the key problems of current production, and combining them with the long-term technological transformation of enterprises; second, focusing on key points, dividing into stages, concentrating superior forces, and launching assault campaigns; third, organizing joint technical selection competitions among multiple trades, widely establishing pace-setters, and comprehensively promoting advanced experiences in complete sets, so that blooming in one place leads to fruitful results everywhere; fourth, fully mobilizing all positive factors and giving full play to the role of engineering and technical personnel.

Formulating technological revolution plans is an important method for strengthening the Party's leadership over the technological revolution movement and fully leveraging the creativity and initiative of the vast number of workers. Since the beginning of this year, the industrial front in Hebei Province, from the province to the city (prefecture), from various professional bureaus to factories, and from factories to production workshops and teams, has formulated comprehensive plans at all levels. These plans have clear goals and specific indicator requirements, as well as practical and feasible guarantee measures; they have both annual plans and specific arrangements on a quarterly and monthly basis. This closely integrates the solution of the current production key problems of enterprises with the long-term technological transformation, powerfully promoting the technological innovation movement.

In carrying out the technological innovation and revolution movement, all localities also focus on the main problems and major trades in production, seizing key points, organizing forces, and implementing assault campaigns to achieve breakthroughs in key areas and blooming everywhere. Tianjin first focused on six trades with a large proportion of manual operations and heavy labor, such as hoisting and handling, crushing, casting, forging, fitter, and packaging, and nine industries, such as shoemaking, paper products, rubber products, and salt industry, for assault. After a short period, heavy physical labor such as carrying, lifting, shouldering, and pulling in the city's handling processes has been replaced by cars, light rails, conveyor belts, and pipelines; the city's casting, forging, fitter and other trades have basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization. In the past, the train loading and unloading section of Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant used shoulders to carry coal and ore. Now, the workers have made their own electric shovels, chute tipper trucks and other machinery, increasing the proportion of mechanical operation by transportation and loading and unloading workers from 30% to over 70%.

Organizing large-scale technical pace-setter selection competitions, promoting the valuable experiences created by the masses through on-site mutual performance competitions, and comprehensively promoting the most advanced technical experiences is an effective method for transforming advanced production levels into social production levels as quickly as possible. In more than a month, the province organized 14 industries and 560 advanced producers to promote 86 sets and 882 advanced experiences in various places. At the same time, various regions and industries also established pace-setters at all levels by holding technical performance competitions, selecting advanced sports meets, and professional meetings. In the massive advanced technology performance competition, 130,000 textile workers in Tianjin emerged with more than 10,000 various types of advanced pace-setters, and summarized and promoted more than 2,000 advanced operating technology experiences. In the recent 20 days, through technical competitions at all levels, the coal industry workers across the province promoted 409 advanced experiences in only four trades: moving electric chutes, electric chute maintenance, props, and back props, allowing the backward to catch up with the advanced, and the advanced to become even more advanced.

While giving full play to the wisdom of the vast number of workers, the Party organizations of enterprises in various places have paid special attention to giving full play to the role of engineering and technical personnel. Many factories have organized technical personnel into the vigorous mass movement through forms such as "three-way combination" groups, "design institutes," and "technical research institutes"; some factories have also organized "three-way combinations" with professional scientific research departments, universities, and other units. This closely combines the technical theoretical knowledge of technical personnel with the practical experience of the vast number of workers, which has played a great role in promoting the in-depth development of the technological innovation and revolution movement.

    河北工业战线向机械化、半机械化疾进
    制定技术革命规划　抓紧重点分段突击  广泛选拔技术标兵　成套推广先进经验
    全省百万职工一月份提出革新建议四十七万件。天津市机械化、半机械化程度从43％提高到52％以上。二十五座现代化大煤矿基本上实现了攉煤机械化。邯郸专区中小型高炉矿石破碎有85％以上实现了机械化。
    新华社天津11日电　本社记者方辰、黄军报道：进入1960年以来，河北省工业战线上的技术革新和技术革命运动跨入新阶段。全省一百多万名职工掀起了一个规模空前的机械化、半机械化运动；部分条件具备的企业，已开始向自动化、半自动化方向疾进。仅在1月份，全省职工提出的革新建议就达四十七万件，比去年同期增加了一点二倍，目前已经实现了十四万五千件。
    技术革新和技术革命运动的广泛开展，日新月异地改变着河北省工业企业的面貌。许多地区、行业和企业的机械化、半机械化程度正在迅速提高。天津市在很短时期内，使机械化半机械化程度由原来的43％提高到目前的52％以上。全省二十五座现代化大型煤矿不到一个月时间就基本上实现了攉煤机械化，使一万多名攉煤工人放下了大板锨。邯郸专区在一月之间，全区中、小型高炉矿石破碎有85％以上实现了机械化。许多机械化程度很高的现代化大型企业，也以高速度的步伐向自动化半自动化迈进。机械化程度的提高，显著地提高了劳动生产率，保证了生产的大面积持续高产，全省工业企业实现了1月开门红。
    河北省技术革新和技术革命运动所以发展得如此迅速和广泛，效果如此显著，基本经验是：一，从实际出发，层层制订规划，既解决当前生产关键，又结合企业长远技术改造；二，抓重点，分阶段，集中优势力量，开展突击运动；三，组织多工种联合技术选拔赛，广树标兵，集中地成套地推广先进经验，作到一处开花遍地结果；四，充分调动各方面的积极因素，发挥工程技术人员的作用。
    制订技术革命规划，是加强党对技术革命运动的领导、充分发挥广大职工创造性和积极性的重要方法。今年以来，河北省工业战线从省到市（专区），从各专业局到工厂，从工厂到生产车间、小组，层层制订了全面规划。这些规划既有明确的奋斗目标和具体的指标要求，又有切实可行的保证措施；既有年度计划，又有按季、按月的具体安排。这样就把解决企业当前的生产关键和进行长远的技术改造紧密地结合在一起，有力地推动了技术革新运动。
    在开展技术革新技术革命运动中，各地还针对生产中的主要问题，主要工种，抓住重点，组织力量，实行突击，作到重点突破，四面开花。天津市首先抓住手工操作和笨重劳动比例大的起重搬运、破碎、铸工、锻工、钳工、包装等六个工种和制鞋、制纸品、橡胶制品和盐业等九个行业进行突击，经过短短的时间，许多工厂搬运中的背、抬、扛、拉等笨重体力劳动已为车子、轻轨、传送带、管道所代替；全市铸工、锻工、钳工等工种已基本上实现了机械化半机械化。天津第一钢厂火车装卸工段，过去运煤运矿石都用肩抬，现在工人们自制了电铲、滑道翻斗车等机械，使运输装卸工人机械操作的比重由30％提高到70％以上。
    组织大规模的技术标兵选拔赛，把群众创造出来的宝贵经验，通过现场互相表演比武，把最先进的技术经验加以全面推广，是使先进生产水平最快地变为社会生产水平的有效办法。一个多月以来，全省组织十四个行业，五百六十名先进生产者，分头到各地推广了八十六套、八百八十二项先进经验。同时各地区各行业还通过举行技术表演赛、选拔先进运动会、专业会等，层层树立标兵。天津市十三万名纺织工人，在声势浩大的先进技术表演赛中，涌现出各类先进标兵一万多名，总结推广了先进操作技术经验二千多项。全省煤炭工业职工在最近二十天内，通过层层技术比武，仅在移电溜子、电溜子维护、支柱、回柱四个工种，就推广了四百零九项先进经验，使落后的赶上了先进水平，先进的更加先进。
    各地企业党组织在充分发挥广大工人智慧的同时，都特别注意发挥了工程技术人员的作用。许多工厂通过“三结合”小组、“设计院”、“技术研究院”等形式，把技术人员组织到轰轰烈烈的群众运动中；有的工厂还同专业的科学研究部门、高等学校等单位组织“三结合”，这样就把技术人员的技术理论知识与广大工人群众的实践经验紧密的结合起来，对促进技术革新和技术革命运动的深入发展起了很大作用。
