Hunan Launches Mass Campaign to Accumulate Fertilizer
Liling Develops "Four Diligences, Eight Possessions" Experience, Increasing Fertilizer Accumulation Threefold Compared to Pre-Commune Era

(Our Dispatch) A fertilizer accumulation army of more than seven million people in Hunan Province, in the second spring of the People's Commune, has launched an unprecedented new upsurge in fertilizer accumulation. Up to now, the province has accumulated more than 10 billion dan of various fertilizers, averaging about 250 dan of fertilizer per mu. Now, seizing the favorable opportunity, they are advancing victoriously to prepare more fertilizer for winning a great agricultural harvest.

The new upsurge in fertilizer accumulation throughout the province has been launched on a larger scale by the vast number of cadres and masses, based on a full understanding of the new situation and new tasks of spring plowing production. This year, the spring sowing area in various parts of the province has greatly increased compared with previous years, and the sowing season should be advanced, requiring early preparation of sufficient base fertilizer; the area of spring harvested crops is larger than in previous years, and to win the "good start" in agriculture, it is necessary to apply more fertilizer. Therefore, fertilizer accumulation has become the central task of the spring production campaign. The current characteristics of the fertilizer accumulation movement in Hunan Province are the establishment of fertilizer bases, the implementation of a specialized team fertilizer production system, and the combination of a mass campaign to accumulate fertilizer. In the Xiangtan Special Zone, a fertilizer accumulation army of 1.2 million people has widely used methods such as shoveling, accumulating, sweeping, digging, beating, mowing, cleaning, and inspecting to develop a large number of fertilizer sources, with an average of more than 380 dan of fertilizer accumulated per mu in the entire district. Yongshun County, according to the characteristics of mountainous areas and the new situation that dryland crops need more hot fertilizer earlier in the season, party committee secretaries at the county to production team levels took the lead in burning fire and soil ash. Using on-site meetings to promote advanced experience, they burned more than 11 million dan of ash in three days. In order to quickly turn coarse fertilizer into high-quality fertilizer, all localities attach great importance to the composting and fertilizer preservation work in fertilizer accumulation.

In the mass campaign to accumulate fertilizer, all localities give full play to the superiority of the People's Commune and establish fertilizer bases, opening up broad avenues for the regular accumulation of high-quality fertilizer. The more than 187,000 pig farms newly built and renovated by the People's Communes throughout the province have become an important base for fertilizer accumulation. Since last autumn, pig raising and fertilizer accumulation have reached 400 to 500 million dan. Xinhuang Dong Autonomous County, which raises the most pigs, already has an average of 60 dan of pig manure per mu of land. Another fertilizer base is the 20 million mu of green manure that are found all over the place. According to the provincial average for paddy fields, there is one mu of green manure for every two or more mu of paddy fields. All localities have adopted methods such as "using small fertilizer to nourish large fertilizer" and opening ditches for drainage to promote early maturity and high yield of green manure.

Household fertilizer is an important source of fine fertilizer. When all localities accumulate soil fertilizer on a large scale, they attach more importance to the collection and storage of household fertilizer than before, and the system is more sound. Some communes in Xiangtan Special Zone have developed the "Four Diligences and Eight Possessions" fertilizer accumulation experience of Liling County into "Eight Diligences and Twelve Possessions" (diligent padding, diligent removal, diligent composting, diligent sweeping, diligent turning, diligent burning, diligent making, diligent cultivating; cattle have pens, pigs have sties, people have toilets, canteens have ash houses, every household has pits, every field has ponds, every field has fertilizer storage, every team has a fertilizer factory, fertilizer accumulation has tasks, fertilizer delivery has rewards, fertilizer collection has special personnel, and fertilizer application has proportions), and the household fertilizer collection work has achieved great results. The district has now collected more than 730 million dan of household fertilizer. Shaoyang County combined political and ideological education with the establishment of a household fertilizer collection system and material rewards in the collection of household fertilizer. In the past three months, it has collected more than 50 million dan of household fertilizer.

In order to accumulate more and faster fertilizer and ensure that the existing fertilizer is put into the fields in a timely manner, all localities are making great efforts in tool reform. Now, the tool reform from fertilizer accumulation, ash burning, fertilizer transportation to turning ponds and fertilizer production is being widely carried out.

(Our Dispatch) Liling County, Hunan Province, based on the new situation after the people's communes, further developed and promoted the "Four Diligences and Eight Possessions" experience of fertilizer accumulation and preservation, realizing both quantity and quality, and preparing sufficient fertilizer for spring sowing and summer harvest crops.

The "Four Diligences and Eight Possessions" fertilizer accumulation method is an advanced fertilizer accumulation method of Liling farmers. Its specific content is: "Four Diligences" (diligent padding, diligent removal, diligent sweeping, diligent burning), "Eight Possessions" (cattle have pens, pigs have sties, chickens and ducks have roosts, people have toilets, ash has houses, manure has ponds, there is green manure in the fields, and there is fertilizer everywhere). After the communization, some people saw that the production of the people's communes was large-scale production, and the means of production had been nationalized, so they mistakenly believed that the "Four Diligences and Eight Possessions" fertilizer accumulation method was not important. In response to this situation, the Liling County Party Committee sent working groups to conduct in-depth investigations and study with the masses to continue to promote it. In 1959, due to the application of the "Four Diligences and Eight Possessions" experience, the amount of fertilizer accumulation rose sharply. The county applied 1,100 dan of fertilizer per mu, an average increase of more than 300 dan of fertilizer per mu compared with before the communization. Up to February 9 this year, the county has accumulated an average of more than 870 dan of fertilizer per mu. Facts have proved that after the communization, not only did it not block the way to accumulate household fertilizer, but it opened up a broader road for increasing household fertilizer accumulation.

After the communization, the new situation of large collectives, large-scale production, and large-scale collaboration enabled the "Four Diligences and Eight Possessions" fertilizer accumulation experience, which was originally used for individual households or small collectives, to be greatly developed and become an important method of the entire fertilizer accumulation movement. First of all, the pond composting in the fields has been newly developed. The communes gave full play to the power of the mass movement and large-scale operations, and quickly realized the ponding, and now there are more than 1.25 million large ponds in the fields and more than 20,000 fertilizer storages in the fields in the county. In the past, in 1958, when there were the most composting ponds, only about 40% of the fields in the county had field ponds. With the establishment of the canteen, each canteen has established one or two large ponds with more than 1,000 dan. At the same time, the fertilizer accumulation habit of one household and one household pond is still maintained. In the collection of household fertilizer, the past experience has also been developed, realizing "fertilizer accumulation has tasks, fertilizer delivery has rewards, fertilizer collection has special personnel, and fertilizer application has proportions."

Secondly, according to the characteristics of centralized livestock raising after the communization, in terms of livestock fertilizer accumulation, with the new construction and renovation of livestock sheds, manure storage ponds have been generally renovated and expanded; and the responsibility system has been implemented, so livestock fertilizer has been greatly increased. Before the communization, a cow could generally only pad the pen to accumulate 10 to 20 dan of fertilizer per month, but now it has increased to 30 to 40 dan. A pig could only accumulate about 40 dan of fertilizer per year in the past, but now it has been increased to more than 60 dan.

After the communization, more than 40,000 kilns have been built throughout the county, and more than 25 million dan of fire and soil ash have been burned. This is more than the amount of fire and soil ash mainly accumulated by individual households cooking and burning ash in the past. Before the communization, the amount of ash used per mu of early rice was only five or six dan per year, but last year it increased to more than 20 dan, and this year it is estimated that it will increase several times.

This year, the area of green manure in the county has been expanded from 320,000 mu to 380,000 mu. In order to promote high yield and early maturity of green manure, some communes have proposed "diligent cultivation" in the "Four Diligences and Eight Possessions" according to local conditions. Now, more than 156,000 mu of green manure in the county have been top-dressed three times. Others have generally top-dressed one or two times of welcoming spring fertilizer, and are preparing to top-dress two more times of seedling fertilizer between "Rain Water" and "Awakening of Insects", striving for a yield of 10,000 jin per mu.

The communization has created incomparably superior conditions for large-scale fertilizer infrastructure construction. The county has now realized that every team has a fertilizer factory, expanding the new content of "Four Diligences and Eight Possessions". More than 70,000 dan of fertilizers such as potassium, calcium, and potassium-magnesium have been produced.

Due to the development of the "Four Diligences and Eight Possessions" experience, the quantity and quality of fertilizer accumulation have been greatly improved. As of February 9, the county has accumulated more than 500 million dan of various fertilizers, including more than 18 million dan of various household fertilizers and more than 11 million dan of animal fertilizers. According to the average of the original cultivated land, each mu has reached more than 870 dan. Among them, high-quality fertilizer accounts for about 70%; compared with the same period in 1958 before the communization, it has increased by about three times, and compared with the same period last year after the communization, it has also increased by more than one time.

    湖南千军万马突击积肥
    醴陵发展“四勤八有”经验积肥量比公社化前增三倍
    本报讯　湖南省七百多万积肥大军，在人民公社第二个春天里，掀起了空前未有的积肥新高潮。到目前止，全省已积制各种肥料一百多亿担，平均每亩有肥料二百五十担左右。现在正抓住有利时机，乘胜前进，为夺取农业大丰收准备更多的肥料。
    全省积肥新高潮是广大干部、群众在充分认识春耕生产的新形势、新任务的基础上，以更大规模猛烈开展起来的。今年全省各地春播面积比往年大大增加，播种季节要提早，要求及早准备充足的基肥；春收作物面积比往年多，要夺取农业“开门红”，必须追施更多肥料。因此，积肥已成为春季生产运动的中心任务。湖南省当前积肥运动的特点是建立肥料基地，实行专业队积肥制肥与大搞群众性突击积肥运动相结合。湘潭专区一百二十万积肥大军，普遍运用铲、积、扫、挖、打、刈、清、检等办法，开辟了大量肥源，全区积肥平均每亩达三百八十多担。永顺县根据山区特点和旱地作物提早季节需要热性肥较多的新情况，从县到生产队，四级党委书记带头烧火土灰。运用现场会议推广先进经验，三天中烧灰一千一百多万担。为了迅速变粗肥为优质肥，各地在积肥中十分重视肥料的沤制与保肥工作。
    在群众性突击积肥运动中，各地充分发挥人民公社优越性，建立肥料基地，开辟了经常性的大积优质肥的广阔道路。全省人民公社共新建、整修的十八万七千多处养猪场，成为积肥的重要基地。去秋以来，养猪积肥已达四、五亿担。养猪最多的新晃僮族自治县，平均每亩地已有猪栏肥六十担。另一肥料基地是遍布各地的二千万亩绿肥。按全省水田平均，每两亩多水田有一亩绿肥。各地对绿肥都采取“以小肥养大肥”和开沟排水等办法，促进绿肥早熟高产。
    家肥是精肥的重要来源之一。各地大积土肥时，对家肥收集保管工作比前更为重视，制度更加健全。湘潭专区有些公社发展醴陵县“四勤八有”积肥经验为“八勤十二有”（勤垫、勤出、勤沤、勤扫、勤翻、勤烧、勤制、勤培；牛有栏、猪有圈、人有厕所、食堂有灰屋、家家有坑、田田有凼、田头有肥库、队队有造肥厂、积肥有任务、交肥有报酬、收肥有专人、用肥有比例），家肥收集工作取得很大成绩，全区现已收集家肥七亿三千多万担。邵阳县在收集家肥中，实行政治思想教育和建立家肥收集制度、物质奖励相结合，过去三个月已收集家肥五千多万担。
    为了多积、快积肥料，保证把已有肥料及时下到田里，各地大闹工具改革。现在从积肥、烧灰、运肥到翻凼、制肥的工具改革正在广泛开展。
    本报讯　湖南省醴陵县根据人民公社化后的新形势，进一步发展和推广了“四勤八有”的积肥保肥经验，实现数量质量并举，为春播和夏收作物备足肥料。
    “四勤八有”的积肥方法，是醴陵农民的先进积肥方法。它的具体内容是：“四勤”（勤垫、勤出、勤扫、勤烧）、“八有”（牛有栏、猪有圈、鸡鸭有埘、人有厕所、灰有屋、粪有池、田中有绿肥、处处有粪了）。公社化后，由于有些人看到人民公社化的生产是大生产，生产资料已归公，便误认为“四勤八有”积肥办法无关紧要了。中共醴陵县委针对这个情况，派出工作组，深入进行调查，与群众共同研究，继续推广。1959年由于运用“四勤八有”经验，积肥的数量猛烈上升。全县每亩施肥达一千一百担，比公社化前平均每亩增积肥料三百多担。今年到2月9日止，全县每亩平均已积肥料八百七十多担。事实证明：人民公社化后，不仅没有堵塞积家肥的门路，反为增积家肥开辟了更加广阔的道路。
    公社化后，大集体、大生产、大协作的新形势，使原来用于一家一户或小集体的“四勤八有”积肥经验，获得了海阔天空的发展，成为整个积肥运动的重要办法。首先是田凼沤肥得到了新发展。各公社发挥群众运动和大兵团作战威力，迅速实现了凼子化，现在全县有田间大凼一百二十五万多个，田头肥库二万多个。而过去沤凼最多的1958年，全县也只有40％左右的田有田凼。随着食堂的建立，每一食堂都建立了一至二个一千担以上的大凼。同时，一户一个家凼的积肥习惯仍然保持下来。在收集家肥上，也发展了过去的经验，实现了“积肥有任务，交肥有报酬，收肥有专人，用肥有比例。”
    其次，根据公社化后牲畜集中饲养的特点，在积牲畜肥方面，随着畜舍的新建、改建，普遍整修、扩大了贮粪池；并实行了责任制，因而牲畜肥大大增加。公社化前，一头牛一般每月只能垫栏积肥十到二十担，现在增到三十到四十担。一头猪过去一年只能积肥四十担左右，现在提高到六十担以上。
    公社化以后，全县共建窑四万多个，已烧火土灰二千五百多万担。这与过去火土灰主要靠一家一户煮饭烧灰积得更多。公社化前，每年早稻每亩插灰用量不过五、六担，去年增到二十担以上，今年估计还会成倍增加。
    今年全县绿肥面积由三十二万亩扩大到三十八万亩。为了促进绿肥高产早熟，在“四勤八有”中，有些公社因地制宜提出了“勤培”。现在全县已有十五万六千多亩绿肥追了三次肥。其它一般都追了一、二次迎春肥，在“雨水”、“惊蛰”间准备再追二次催苗肥，力争亩产万斤。
    公社化为大搞肥料基本建设创造了无比优越的条件。全县现已实现队队有造肥厂，扩大了“四勤八有”的新内容。现已生产钾、钙、钾镁等肥料七万多担。
    由于“四勤八有”经验得到发展，积肥的数量与质量都大大提高，到2月9日止，全县已积制各种肥料五亿多万担，其中收集各种家肥有一千八百多万担，畜肥一千一百多万担。按原有田土平均，每亩已达八百七十多担。其中优质肥占70％左右；与公社化前的1958年同期比较，增加了三倍左右，与公社化后的去年同期比较，也增加了一倍多。
