Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 1st – All major newspapers in Rangoon today carried the full texts of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the agreement on the boundary issue between the two countries on the front page under banner headlines. The newspapers also published photos of Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Ne Win signing the treaty and agreement, and photos of Chairman Liu Shaoqi meeting with Prime Minister Ne Win.

The "Guardian," in its headline carrying the full text of the treaty and agreement, said, "Resolve all disputes through peaceful negotiations," "Do not participate in military alliances directed against the other party." The newspaper also published photos of Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Ne Win holding friendly talks in a harmonious atmosphere, as well as photos of General Zhang Aiping, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, presenting gifts to General Aung Gyi, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Burmese Armed Forces.

The "Guardian" said in its editorial yesterday, "We hope that the spirit that guided China and Burma to successfully resolve the long-standing boundary issue between the two countries will also be reflected in the relations between our neighbors China, Indonesia and India in dealing with their outstanding issues."

The newspaper expressed its hope that "the issues between India and China will be resolved in the not too distant future." It said, "We have just had the pleasant experience of Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai putting the principles of the Bandung Conference into practice in the relations between Burma and Indonesia." It hopes that the initiators of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence will soon be able to resolve the disputes that currently hinder the long and friendly history of the entire East.

The newspaper said that India and China should act in accordance with the wishes of their smaller brother countries. Time and circumstances have made it possible for these two countries to write an Asian history that has never been written before.

The newspaper expressed its hope that India and China will coexist with mutual respect and mutual trust, otherwise they will not be able to fulfill their responsibilities to Asia.

"Burma New Light of Asia," "Voice of Peacock" and "The Nation" all emphasized in their headlines the points of not participating in military alliances directed against the other party and resolving disputes through negotiations.

The editorial of "Voice of Peacock" said that the conclusion of the treaty and agreement "is the result of the foresight and broad-mindedness of the governments of China and Burma, and the achievement of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence." This is also "an achievement that will inevitably be included in the history of Sino-Burmese relations." The editorial emphasized that the conclusion of the treaty and agreement "shows that the Chinese government is sincere to small countries, that it has no desire for aggression, but only a desire for peaceful coexistence." The newspaper concluded by saying, "May this achievement in creating friendship between the two countries be forever consolidated and stable."

The "Burma Times" pointed out in an article that all the people of Burma are satisfied and happy with the treaties and agreements signed by the governments of China and Burma, "because there is a possibility for further development of Sino-Burmese friendship." The article said, "The people of Burma will certainly be grateful to General Ne Win's government for signing these two documents; and they will also be grateful to the government of the People's Republic of China for demonstrating a genuine spirit of good neighborliness."

The Presidium of the Burma National United Front issued a statement today saying that the conclusion of the Sino-Burmese treaties and agreements is an achievement of all the people of Burma, and the Burma National United Front warmly welcomes this treaty and agreement. The statement pointed out, "China and Burma are very close neighbors, therefore, it is of great benefit to the people of China and Burma to maintain friendship, peaceful coexistence and mutual non-aggression between the two countries in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 1st – The "People's Daily" today published a commentary on the signing of the "Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Sino-Burmese Agreement on the Border Issue" between China and Burma, saying that the People's Republic of China and the Union of Burma are two neighboring countries in Asia. Strengthening the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries is not only beneficial to the people of both countries, but also contributes to the common cause of consolidating the solidarity of Asian and African countries and safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.

The commentary said that the Prime Ministers of China and Burma established the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in a joint statement issued six years ago in Rangoon, the capital of Burma. Over the years, the friendly relations between China and Burma in all aspects, established on the solid foundation of the above-mentioned Five Principles, have been continuously developed. The Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Agreement on the Border Issue between the two countries are a new victory for the people of China and Burma, and also a new victory for the above-mentioned Five Principles.

The commentary pointed out that just as the bellicose imperialists of the West, headed by the United States, are deliberately running counter to the increasingly easing trend of the international situation and stepping up their efforts to undermine the solidarity between the people of all countries, especially the Asian and African countries, and the People's Republic of China, the good results of the talks between Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Ne Win and the signing of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Sino-Burmese Border Issue Agreement are of greater significance. It shattered the slander and distortion of the imperialists against the consistent peaceful policy of the People's Republic of China, and shattered the imperialists' attempt to obstruct some countries in Southeast Asia and the People's Republic of China from properly resolving certain problems existing between them through peaceful consultation.

The commentary said that Premier Zhou Enlai said at the farewell banquet held by Prime Minister Ne Win on the evening of January 28, "We are determined to make the border between our two countries a border of peace and friendship." Premier Zhou Enlai's words are fully in line with the wishes of the people of Asian and African countries and the people of other countries in the world to expand the area of peace and turn the borders between countries into borders of peace and friendship.

The commentary concluded by saying that the Vietnamese people, who have good neighborly relations with the People's Republic of China and the Union of Burma, are as happy as the people of Asian and African countries for the development of Sino-Burmese friendship and harmonious relations.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st – Tokyo News: Koichiro Okakura, Standing Director of the Japan-Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee, told reporters today that the Japan-Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee heartily welcomes the signing of the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Agreement on the Sino-Burmese Border Issue between China and Burma.

Okakura said that this treaty and agreement set an example for the peaceful coexistence of socialist countries and non-socialist countries.

Okakura emphasized that the signing of the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the agreement on the border issue between China and Burma is of particularly great significance at a time when the US imperialists are bent on provoking conflicts in Asian countries. Therefore, it gives a great blow to the US imperialists and helps to frustrate the conspiracies currently being planned by the US.

He also emphasized that the treaties and agreements signed between China and Burma will greatly contribute to the resolution of other disputes in Asia and Africa in the spirit of peaceful coexistence.

Okakura pointed out that the conclusion of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression makes the error of the newly signed US-Japan "Security Treaty" even more obvious as it goes against the trend of the times. He said that the newly signed US-Japan military alliance treaty runs counter to the increasingly dominant trend in Asia and Africa.

Okakura finally said that the treaties and agreements signed between China and Burma clearly show that the Japanese people's struggle to prevent the ratification of the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" and to promote Japan's neutrality is reasonable and in line with the trend of history. He said that only by following the example of China and Burma can Japan establish friendly relations with China and other socialist countries.

    亚洲国家公众舆论评中缅两国签订的条约和协定
    和平共处原则的成就　帝国主义阴谋的失利
    缅甸报纸强调缅甸人民对中缅友好的发展感到高兴
    越南“人民报”指出这是对巩固亚非各国团结的贡献
    日本亚非团结委员会认为这有助于挫败美国的阴谋
    新华社仰光1日电　仰光所有的主要报纸今天都在头版以通栏大标题刊载了中缅友好和互不侵犯条约以及两国边界问题协定的全文。各报还刊载了周恩来总理和奈温总理在条约和协定上签字的照片，并且刊载了刘少奇主席接见奈温总理时合影的照片。
    “卫报”在刊载条约和协定的全文时所用的标题中说，“通过和平谈判来解决一切争端”，“不参加针对另一方的军事同盟”。这家报纸还刊载了周恩来总理同奈温总理在融洽气氛中举行友好会谈的照片以及中国人民解放军副总参谋长张爱萍将军向缅甸联邦国防军副总参谋长昂季将军赠送礼物等照片。
    “卫报”在昨天发表的社论说，“我们希望，指导中国和缅甸成功地解决两国间长期悬而未决的边界问题的那种精神，也将在我们的邻国中国、印度尼西亚和印度在对待它们悬而未决问题的相互关系中体现出来。”
    这家报纸表示希望，“印度和中国之间的问题在不太遥远的将来将得到解决。”它说到，“我们对于中国总理周恩来在对缅甸和印度尼西亚的关系中把万隆会议原则付诸实践，刚有过愉快的经历”。它希望共处的五项原则的倡议人即将能解决目前妨碍整个东方的悠久和友好历史的纠纷。
    这家报纸说，印度和中国应当按照它们较小的兄弟国家的希望行事。时间和环境已使这两个国家有可能写出以前从来未曾写过的亚洲历史。
    这家报纸表示希望印中两国互相尊重和互相信任地共处，否则它们将不能尽到它们对亚洲的责任。
    “缅甸新光报”、“孔雀之声报”和“联邦报”都在标题中强调不参加针对另一方的军事同盟和通过谈判来解决争端这些点。
    “孔雀之声报”的社论说，条约和协定的缔结，“是中国和缅甸两国政府远见和胸襟广阔的结果，是和平共处五项原则的成就”。这也是“必然会列入中缅关系史中的一个成就”。社论强调指出，条约和协定的缔结“说明，中国政府对小国是真诚的，它没有侵略的欲望，而只有和平共处的愿望”。这家报纸最后说，“愿两国在缔造友好方面取得的这种成就永远巩固和稳定。”
    “缅甸时报”在一篇文章中指出，缅甸全体人民对中缅两国政府签订的条约和协定感到满意和高兴，“因为中缅友好有了进一步发展的可能”。文章说，“缅甸人民一定会感激奈温将军的政府，因为它签订了这两个文件；也一定会感激中华人民共和国政府，因为它表现了真正的睦邻精神。”
    缅甸民族团结阵线主席团今天发表声明说，中缅条约和协定的缔结是缅甸全体人民的成就，缅甸民族团结阵线热烈地欢迎这个条约和协定。声明指出，“中国和缅甸是关系非常密切的邻邦，因此，根据和平共处五项原则，两国保持友好、和平共处和互不侵犯，对中缅两国人民是有巨大利益的。”
    据新华社河内1日电“人民报”今天就中缅两国签订“中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和中缅关于两国边界问题协定”发表评论说，中华人民共和国和缅甸联邦是居于亚洲的两个邻国。加强两国之间的友好和合作关系，不仅有利于两国人民，而且对巩固亚非各国之间的团结、维护亚洲和世界和平的共同事业作出了贡献。
    评论说，中国和缅甸两国总理六年前在缅甸首都仰光发表的联合声明中，确定和平共处五项原则。几年来，中国同缅甸在上述五项原则的稳固基础上所建立的各方面的友好关系得到不断地发展。两国签订的友好和互不侵犯条约和关于两国之间的边界问题协定是中缅两国人民的新胜利，同时也是上述五项原则的新胜利。
    评论指出，正当以美国为首的西方的好战的帝国主义分子有意地同国际局势日益缓和的趋向背道而驰，加紧破坏各国人民、尤其是亚非各国同中华人民共和国之间的团结的时候，周恩来总理同奈温总理会谈的良好结果以及中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和中缅边界问题协定的签订更加具有重大的意义。它粉碎了帝国主义对中华人民共和国始终不渝的和平政策的诬蔑和歪曲，粉碎了帝国主义企图阻挠东南亚一些国家和中华人民共和国对它们之间存在的某些问题可以通过和平协商的方法求得妥善解决的论调。
    评论说，周恩来总理1月28日晚上在奈温总理所举行的告别宴会上说，“我们有决心使我们两国的边界成为和平友好的边界”。周恩来总理的这句话，完全符合当前亚非各国人民和世界上其他国家人民关于扩大和平地区和把各国之间的边界变成和平和友谊的边界的愿望。
    评论最后说，同中华人民共和国和缅甸联邦有着睦邻关系的越南人民与亚非各国人民一样，为中缅友好、和睦关系的发展而高兴。
    新华社1日讯　东京消息：日本亚非团结委员会常任理事冈仓古志郎今天对新闻记者说，日本亚非团结委员会衷心地欢迎中国和缅甸两国之间签订友好和互不侵犯条约和关于中缅边界问题的协定。
    冈仓古志郎说，这个条约和协定为社会主义国家同非社会主义国家和平共处树立了榜样。
    冈仓古志郎着重指出，正当美国帝国主义者一心想挑拨亚洲国家发生冲突的时候，中缅两国签订的友好和互不侵犯条约以及有关边界问题的协定更具有特别重大的意义。因此，它给美国帝国主义者以很大的打击，并且有助于挫败美国目前策划的阴谋。
    他还着重指出，中缅两国之间签订的条约和协定将大大有助于以和平共处的精神来解决亚洲和非洲的其他争执。
    冈仓指出，中缅友好和互不侵犯条约的缔结使已签字的新的美日“安全条约”违背时代潮流的错误格外明显。他说，新签订的日美军事同盟条约是同在亚非两洲日益占上风的潮流背道而驰的。
    冈仓最后说，中国和缅甸签订的条约和协定清楚地说明日本人民阻止批准新的美日“安全条约”和促使日本趋向中立的斗争是合情合理，符合历史潮流的。他说，只有效法中缅两国的榜样，日本才能同中国和其他社会主义国家建立起友好关系。
