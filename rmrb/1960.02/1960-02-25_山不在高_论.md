On "Mountains Not Needing to be High"
    Ma Wen

    The day before yesterday afternoon, I went to the Shanghai Guangke Scientific Instrument Factory for some business. Entering the factory gate, I suddenly thought of "An Inscription for My Humble Abode":
    "Mountains need not be high; it is fame that counts. Waters need not be deep; it is dragons that bring magic."

    This association seemed sudden, but it was not without reason. The entire factory building here is just an ordinary three-story residential building, with a family still living on the third floor; a workshop is only three meters wide and four meters long, probably the original bedroom or living room; a few single-story houses are built in front of the building as a metalworking workshop, probably the original small garden or lawn. If you didn't see the boxes of finished instruments waiting to be shipped piled up at the entrance of the alley, and didn't see the sign at the door, you might find it hard to imagine that the only high-voltage bridge in the country was made here, and you might find it hard to imagine that an indomitable hero would grow up here.

    This is what people used to call a "lane factory." Adding the word "lane" in front of "factory" clearly implies a certain contempt. Some people look down on lane factories for their simple factory buildings and equipment, and their weak technical strength; they look down on the fact that the mountains here are not high and the waters are not deep, thinking that they cannot achieve great things. Yes, the Shanghai Guangke Instrument Factory doesn't even have an engineer, and in the past, it didn't even have a large lathe, and Wang Linhe only had a junior high school education. However, the ruthless facts severely refuted the view that only saw things and not people. A "golden phoenix" flew out of a "grass nest," and a small "lane factory" successfully trial-produced a high-voltage bridge. Moreover, in our society, there are more than just one or two such golden phoenixes, but more and more of them, emerging in batches. Cutting-edge products such as cortisone and artificial gemstones have all flown out of these unknown general pharmaceutical factories and Wanfeng Glass Factories, etc.

    The Party branch secretary of the Shanghai Guangke Scientific Instrument Factory told me that two years ago, this factory could only produce general instruments, and the workers did not believe that they could produce cutting-edge products. Since 1958, when the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward slogans such as "‘The lowly’ are most intelligent," "Break superstitions, liberate thoughts," and "Dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do," the workers' eyes have brightened, and they have increasingly felt the heavy responsibility on their shoulders. They said, "If others can do it, why can't we?" "We must fill this gap." Under the leadership of the Party branch, many workers have worked hard to study, and Wang Linhe is one of the most prominent. Now, even the family members of employees who have been in the factory for a year or two are ambitiously wanting to participate in the trial production of cutting-edge products.

    From this, it can be seen that for a mountain to have "fame" and for water to have "magic," the determining conditions are not in "high" or "deep." The same "mountain," the same "water"; the same equipment, the same people, why is there such a big difference two years later? - Nothing else, politics has taken the lead, people's mental state has changed, and the masses have been armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Despite the simple equipment and weak technical strength, despite the mountains not being high and the waters not being deep; however, once the working people are liberated from the shackles of inferiority and superstition, they can turn unfavorable conditions into favorable conditions, and their infinite intelligence and talent can reveal the secrets of nature. Didn't someone say that "politics cannot grow rice"? However, more and more facts prove that once advanced political thought is grasped by the masses, it can not only grow more rice, with thousands of catties of production teams appearing everywhere; but also can create high-voltage bridges, cortisone, and artificial gemstones... all kinds of cutting-edge products!

    Liu Yuxi said these two sentences well: "Mountains need not be high; it is fame that counts. Waters need not be deep; it is dragons that bring magic." The decisive condition is not in the height of the mountain or the depth of the water, but in whether there are "immortals" and "dragons." In our society, the working people who have broken superstitions are the "immortals," and the masses who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the "dragons." The reason why the Shanghai Guangke Scientific Instrument Factory, as well as the General Pharmaceutical Factory, Wanfeng Glass Factory, and other "lane factories," can be both "famous" and "magical" is that there are such "immortals" and "dragons" there. In any corner of our motherland, no matter how bad the conditions are or how poor the equipment is, as long as there are working people who have broken superstitions and are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they will definitely be able to create new conditions and arm themselves with new technologies; they will definitely be able to do earth-shattering things and be able to fly out "golden phoenixes." It can be affirmed that we will see more and more "golden phoenixes" spread their wings and fly from "grass nests"!

    Therefore, what could be humble about it?

### “山不在高”论

    “山不在高”论
    马文
    前天下午，有事到沪光科学仪器厂去。走进厂门，忽然想起“陋室铭”：
    “山不在高，有仙则名；水不在深，有龙则灵。”
    这个联想好像突如其来，但也不是没有原因的。这里的全部厂房就是一座三层楼的普通住宅，三层楼上还住着一户人家；一个车间不过三米宽、四米长，大概是原来的卧室或客堂；楼房前面搭了几间平房做金工车间，大概是原来的小花园或草地。如果你不看到弄堂口堆满的一箱箱待运的仪器成品，不看到门口的招牌，也许你很难想像从这里会制成全国独一无二的高压电桥，也许很难想像从这里会成长百折不挠的英雄人物。
    这就是过去人们所谓“弄堂工厂”。在“工厂”前面加上“弄堂”二字，显然含有某种轻视之意。有些人轻视弄堂工厂厂房设备简陋，技术力量薄弱；他们轻视这里山不高、水不深，认为搞不出大名堂。是的，像沪光仪器厂连一个工程师也没有，过去连一个大型车床也没有，王林鹤原来也不过只有初中文化水平。然而，无情的事实狠狠地驳斥了那种见物不见人的观点，“草窠”里却飞出了“金凤凰”，一个小小的“弄堂工厂”却试制成功了高压电桥。而且，在我们社会里，这样的金凤凰不止一只、两只，而是越来越多，成批地涌现。像可的松、人造宝石……等等，尖端产品，都是从这些名不见经传的通用药厂、万丰玻璃厂等“弄堂工厂”里飞出来的。
    沪光科学仪器厂的党支部书记告诉我，两年以前这个厂也只能生产一般的仪器，工人同志也不相信自己能够搞尖端产品。自从1958年党中央和毛主席提出了“‘卑贱者’最聪明”，“破除迷信、解放思想”，“敢想敢说敢做”等口号以后，工人同志的眼睛亮了，越来越感觉到肩头上的重责。他们说：“别人能够做，我们为什么不能做？”“一定要填满这个空白”。在党支部的领导下，很多工人都刻苦钻研，王林鹤就是其中最突出的一个。现在，连进厂一两年的职工家属，也都雄心勃勃地要参加尖端产品的试制工作了。
    由此可见，山要有“名”，水要有“灵”，决定的条件不在于“高”，不在于“深”。同样的“山”，同样的“水”；同样的设备，同样的人，两年前后为什么如此大不同？——无他，政治挂了帅，人的精神状态变了，群众已经被毛泽东思想武装起来了。尽管设备简陋、技术力量薄弱，尽管山不高、水不深；可是，当劳动人民一旦从自卑迷信的思想束缚下解放出来，就能把不利的条件改变成有利的条件，他们无穷尽的聪明才智，就能揭示出大自然的秘密。不是有人说过“政治长不出米来”吗？可是，越来越多的事实证明：先进的政治思想一旦为群众掌握了，就不但能够长出更多的米来，到处出现千斤社、千斤队；而且能够造出高压电桥、可的松和人造宝石……各色各样的尖端产品！
    刘禹锡这两句话说得好：“山不在高，有仙则名；水不在深，有龙则灵。”决定性的条件不在于山之高、水之深，而在于是否有“仙”、有“龙”。在我们的社会里，破除了迷信的劳动人民就是“仙”，被毛泽东思想武装了的群众就是“龙”。沪光科学仪器厂以及通用药厂、万丰玻璃厂等等“弄堂工厂”，所以能够既“名”又“灵”，原因就在于它们那里出现了这样的“仙”和“龙”。在我们祖国的任何一个角落里，不管条件怎样坏，设备怎样差，但是只要有了破除了迷信的、武装着毛泽东思想的劳动人民，就一定能够创造新的条件，能用新技术把自己武装起来；就一定能干出惊天动地的事业，能够飞出“金凤凰”来。可以肯定：我们将看到越来越多的“金凤凰”从“草窠”中展翅飞翔！
    故曰：“何陋之有”？
