    Hefei, February 15th (by our reporter) — Dingyuan, Fengyang, and eleven other counties in Anhui Province, which are frequently threatened by drought and are considered "water conservancy dead ends," have been vigorously conquering these "dead ends" since last winter. They have launched a concentrated effort to construct a large number of large, medium, and small-scale water conservancy projects, resulting in a significant change in the water conservancy situation.
    The drought-prone "water conservancy dead end" areas in Anhui Province include eleven counties: Dingyuan, Fengyang, Jiashan, Hexian, Hanshan, Wuwei, Xuancheng, Langxi, Guangde, Zongyang, and Fengtai. Most of the land in these counties is located in hilly areas. In the past, fewer reservoirs were built, especially large and medium-sized backbone projects. Therefore, they were prone to disasters when droughts occurred. To change this situation, these counties, while constructing small-scale water conservancy projects last winter, also focused on building large and medium-sized backbone projects. Currently, more than 30,000 of the more than 70,000 newly built small-scale water conservancy projects in these counties have been completed. The large and medium-sized projects under construction include: one large reservoir with a storage capacity of over 100 million cubic meters; thirty-four medium-sized reservoirs with a storage capacity of 10 million to 100 million cubic meters, of which eleven have been basically completed; seven river channel projects with a width of 40 to 60 meters and a depth of more than 4 meters; and eighteen pumping stations with 500 to 5,000 horsepower. The trunk canal projects of these pumping stations have generally started construction and are now moving into the construction of factory building foundations. The completed projects can increase water storage by a total of 690 million cubic meters, which can expand and improve the irrigated area by 5.88 million mu. Once these large and medium-sized backbone projects are all completed, they will fundamentally change the water conservancy situation in these counties. For example, as of February 2nd, Dingyuan County had completed twelve medium-sized reservoirs with a storage capacity of over 10 million cubic meters, ninety small reservoirs with a storage capacity of over 1 million cubic meters, and correspondingly repaired 1,316 larger ponds and dams. They also newly dug 406 ditches connecting reservoirs, dams, ponds, and weirs, with a total length of more than 1,000 li. Calculated by earthwork, they have overfulfilled the winter and spring construction task of 60 million cubic meters by 28.9%. These newly completed water conservancy projects are expected to store 250 million cubic meters of water, which is more than the total water storage capacity of all water conservancy projects in the county in 1959, which was 230 million cubic meters. Compared with the water storage capacity of 60 million cubic meters before liberation, it is more than three times higher. The newly added water storage projects are expected to expand the irrigated area by 620,000 mu and improve the irrigated area by 980,000 mu, accounting for 82% of the county's original plan to expand and improve the irrigated area this year, and an increase of more than four times compared with the county's original 320,000 mu of guaranteed harvest area. Langxi County used to have only some small projects with a very small storage capacity. Last year, nearly 50% of the cultivated land was affected by drought. Since last winter, the county has built four large and medium-sized reservoirs in the hilly area. Taking these projects as the main body, through a 350-kilometer-long water diversion canal, tens of thousands of pond and dam projects are connected to form six irrigation networks to regulate water flow with each other. The storage capacity can be increased to 380 million cubic meters, which is enough to meet the needs of double cropping of paddy fields in the whole county, and can make 65% of the paddy fields in the county achieve self-flowing irrigation.
    The construction of large and medium-sized backbone projects in the "water conservancy dead end" areas of Anhui was launched under the battle cry of "eliminate water conservancy dead ends and double the water storage capacity" put forward by the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. The Provincial Party Committee divided the drought-prone key areas of Dingyuan, Fengyang, Jiashan, Xuancheng, Langxi, Guangde, Hexian, Hanshan, and part of Wuwei into three areas, and put forward specific construction measures for the water conservancy backbone projects in these areas. Responsible comrades at all levels also went to the construction sites to supervise and inspect the progress and quality of the projects, and promptly solve specific problems in the construction. They also transferred cadres and engineering technicians, and adopted the method of dividing areas for contracting and division of labor to help the construction in various places. The provincial leading organs have successively allocated 357 water pumps and a large number of water conservancy materials to support the backbone projects in these "water conservancy dead end" areas.
    In order to build water conservancy projects in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, various counties fully mobilized the masses to find construction measures that required less labor and yielded greater benefits. Dingyuan County achieved great results after popularizing many new construction technologies created by the masses. A leap forward situation of "building a small reservoir in five days and a large reservoir in ten days" appeared throughout the county. The first batch of sixty-one small and medium-sized reservoirs were all completed before New Year's Day after one campaign. In the second campaign, forty-one of the second batch of eighty small and medium-sized reservoirs were completed. Seeing that the "water conservancy dead ends" were about to be eliminated, the masses became more and more enthusiastic. They sang: The power of the commune is boundless, the leadership of the Party Committee is better than immortals; reservoirs rise in the blink of an eye, dead end hills turn into fertile fields; this year, a water conservancy network is formed, increasing grain production and cotton production; from now on, the root of drought will be eradicated, and happy days will last for thousands of years.

    根本改变丘陵地区干旱面貌　定叫全省水利建设平衡发展
    安徽奋起征服“水利死角”
    定远等十一个县一冬兴修的水利工程可扩大和改善灌溉面积五百多万亩
    本报合肥15日电　安徽省经常易受旱灾威胁的定远、凤阳等十一县，是“水利死角”，从去冬以来，这些地区大力征服“水利死角”，突击兴修了大批大、中、小型水利工程，水利面貌为之大变。
    安徽省易旱的“水利死角”地区，包括定远、凤阳、嘉山、和县、含山、无为、宣城、郎溪、广德、枞阳、凤台等十一个县。这些县大部土地处于丘陵地区，过去水库修得少，特别是大、中型骨干工程修得少，因此，一遇干旱，便易成灾。为了改变这种情况，这些县在去冬兴修小型水利工程的同时，就大抓特抓大、中型骨干工程。目前，这些县新修的七万多处小型水利工程已经完成三万多处，正在施工的大、中型工程有：蓄水量一亿立方米以上的大型水库一座，蓄水量一千万到一亿立方米的中型水库三十四座，其中十一座已经基本完工；还有宽四十到六十米、深四米以上河道工程七条；具有五百到五千马力的抽水机站十八个，这些抽水机站的干渠工程已普遍开工，并正转入厂房基础的砌筑。已完成的工程共可增加蓄水六亿九千万方，可以扩大和改善灌溉面积五百八十八万亩。这些大、中型骨干工程全部完成以后，将从根本上改变这些县的水利面貌。例如，定远县到2月2日止，已完成的工程有：蓄水一千万立方以上的中型水库十二座，蓄水一百万立方以上的小型水库九十座，并相应整修了较大的塘坝一千三百一十六处，新开连接库坝塘堰的沟渠四百零六条，长达一千多华里，如果按土石方计算，已经超额28．9％完成了冬春两季六千万方的兴修任务。这些新完工的水利工程，预计可以蓄水二亿五千万立方，比全县1959年全部水利工程的总蓄水量二亿三千万立方还多，如果与解放前水利工程蓄水量六千万方相比，则超过三倍多。新增加的蓄水工程预计可以扩大灌溉面积六十二万亩，改善灌溉面积九十八万亩，占全县原计划今年扩大、改善灌溉面积的82％，比全县原有保收面积三十二万亩增长四倍多。郎溪县过去只有一些小型工程，蓄水容量很小，去年即有近50％的耕地受旱。去冬以来，这个县在丘陵区兴建大、中型水库四座，以这些工程为主体，通过总长三百五十公里的引水渠道，把成万处塘坝工程连贯起来，形成六个灌溉网，互相调剂水流，蓄水量可以增加到三亿八千万立方米，足以满足全县水田两季连作的需要，并且可以使全县65％的水田达到自流灌溉。
    安徽“水利死角”地区兴修大、中型骨干工程，是在中共安徽省委提出“消灭水利死角，蓄水量翻一番”的战斗口号下开始行动的。省委把易旱的重点地区定远、凤阳、嘉山、宣城、郎溪、广德、和县、含山和无为的一部分，划分为三个片，对这些地区的水利骨干工程，提出了具体的施工措施。各级负责同志也到工地督促检查工程进度和质量，及时解决施工中的具体问题。并且抽调干部、工程技术人员，采取划片包干分工负责的办法，帮助各地施工。对这些“水利死角”地区的骨干工程，省领导机关已先后调拨了三百五十七台抽水机和大批水利器材加以支援。
    各县为了多快好省地建成水利工程，充分发动群众，大找费工少、效益大的施工措施。定远县在推广群众创造的许多新的施工技术以后，收到极大的效果，全县出现了“五天建一小库，十天建一大库”的跃进局面。第一批六十一个中小型水库，经过一个战役，便在元旦前全部完成。第二批八十座中小水库，在第二战役中又完成了四十一座。群众看到“水利死角”即将消灭，越干劲头越猛。他们歌颂道：公社力量大无边，党委领导赛神仙；瞬眼座座水库起，死角山丘变良田；今年组成水利网，增产粮食又增棉；从此拔掉干旱根，幸福日子万万年。
