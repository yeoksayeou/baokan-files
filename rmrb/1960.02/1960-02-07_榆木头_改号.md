"Blockhead" Gets a New Nickname
	Yú Táng
	Recently, a jingle appeared on the bulletin board at the entrance of the cafeteria:
	"Blockhead" hard to split,
	Known as conservative in the field.
	Technical revolution brings new things,
	"Blockhead" startled awake from a dream.
	Use your brain and innovate,
	No need to refuel by hand anymore.
	Congratulations to Old Yu on his new title:
	The good name of "Innovation Yu" remains.
	There's a story behind this poem.
	It was during the great technical revolution last year when almost everyone in the field offered rationalization proposals and improved many tools, increasing work efficiency. But the fueler, Yu Xinglong, acted as if nothing had happened, still using his hand-cranked oil pump to refuel the cars every day. At the time, some people advised him to use his brain and innovate as well. He shook his head like a rattle drum and said, "There's no way to innovate my old beat-up fuel pump unless the leaders give me an electric one; otherwise, I'll always have to use my hands to crank it."
	Since there were only two fuelers, him and his apprentice, Xiao Li, the field assigned them to Group One of the workshop. During that technical revolution, this group put forward the slogan, "Everyone offers suggestions, everyone innovates." The young people in the group mobilized him, once, twice, but he got fed up and said in a fit of pique, "My head is made of elm, you can't split it open with three axes!" From then on, "Blockhead" became his nickname in the field. That's the origin of "Blockhead."
	Recently, the field launched another technical revolution and technical innovation campaign, and the workers have all taken active action. At first, "Blockhead" still held the old view, thinking that refueling work was too simple and there was nothing to innovate. Apprentice Xiao Li talked to him several times, but he was always cut off, so Xiao Li stopped paying attention to him in a huff.
	One day after lunch, "Blockhead" came out of the cafeteria and saw a bright red big-character poster on the "propaganda front." He walked over curiously and saw that it praised the cafeteria cooks for their technical innovation in creating a "rice washing machine." After reading it, he couldn't help but think, "Even simple work like in the cafeteria can be innovated? That's really amazing!"
	After reading this news, "Blockhead" couldn't sleep well for several nights in a row. One day after work started, he saw that all the cars in the field had gone out and work had slowed down, so he said to apprentice Xiao Li, "Xiao Li, let's go treasure hunting!"
	Xiao Li was confused by his expression at the time, but when he found out that he wanted to make an "electric fuel pump," he jumped up with joy. It was really tiring to refuel by hand; it took more than twenty minutes for one person to crank the pump to fill a car's fuel tank. A thin person like Xiao Li couldn't even fill one car's fuel tank before being exhausted, sweating profusely, and out of breath. There were more than a hundred cars in the field, and they had to wait in long queues every day. "Blockhead" was strong, but he was exhausted after cranking three cars in a row. So, every night from six o'clock to ten o'clock or later, the two of them were always busy with their hands and feet. Xiao Li couldn't help but be happy when he heard that electricity would be used instead of hand-cranking!
	The two of them found an old steering wheel in the workshop to use as a pulley, an old chain to use as a direction joint, and four small figure-eight wheel beads and five meters of waste water pipe to use as a drive shaft. After three days and three nights, the electric fuel pump was made; but there was a problem: there was no power, and it couldn't be used just by looking at it. At this time, Group One of the workshop heard about it and immediately supported them with an electric motor. Finally, refueling with electricity was realized. As long as you press the button, it only takes two minutes to fill a car's fuel tank, and all the cars in the field can be refueled by eight o'clock.
	After that, "Blockhead" spoke at a group meeting, saying, "It's my turn to make a suggestion this time: how about we in the group have everyone make suggestions and everyone innovate in this technical revolution campaign? I guarantee to innovate three more things."
	"Good!" Everyone in the group clapped their hands. Young worker Xiao Wang even made a special suggestion: change "Blockhead"'s nickname. As a result, the whole group unanimously agreed to abolish the nickname "Blockhead" and gave him the beautiful nickname "Innovation Yu."

    “榆木头”改号
    禹堂
    最近，在食堂门口的宣传栏里，出现了这样一首打油诗：
    三斧难开“榆木头”，
    场里出名老保守。
    技术革命出新事，
    梦中惊醒“榆木头”。
    开动脑筋闹革新，
    加油从此不用手。
    恭喜老于得新号：
    “革新于”的美名留。
    说起这首诗，其中还有这么个故事。
    那还是去年大闹技术革命的时候，全场的人差不多都提了合理化建议，改进了许多工具，使工作提高了效率。加油工于兴隆却像没事人似的，还是每天用手摇他的油泵，给汽车加油。当时，有人劝他开动脑筋，也来个革新。他把头摇得像拨浪鼓一样说：“我这老牛破车的加油泵，就没法革新，除非领导给我来一个电动的，不然，永远得用我这双手摇。”
    由于加油工只有他和徒工小李两个人，场里便把他们编在车间一组。这个小组在那次技术革命运动里，提出了“人人提建议，个个有革新”的口号。组里的这伙青年，向他作动员工作，一次、两次，后来他腻烦了，便赌气地说：“我的脑袋是榆木头做的，三斧子也劈不开！”这一来，“榆木头”便在场里叫开了。这就是“榆木头”的由来。
    最近，场里又开展了技术革命和技术革新运动，职工们都积极地行动起来了。起初“榆木头”还是老看法，认为加油工作太简单了，没有什么可革的。徒工小李几次跟他说，都被他抢白回去，小李赌气也不再理他了。
    这天吃过午饭，“榆木头”从食堂出来，见“宣传阵地”贴着一张鲜红的大字报。他好奇地走过去看，原来是表扬食堂炊事人员技术革新，制造出“洗米机”的。他看了后，心中不禁一动：“就凭食堂那样简单的工作，他们也能革新？这真奇了！”
    看了这则消息后，“榆木头”接连好几夜没睡好觉。这天上班后，他看场里的车都出去了，工作闲了下来，便对徒工小李说：“小李，咱们找宝去！”
    小李当时被他的神情闹迷糊了，等知道他要做“电动加油泵”的时候，他高兴得跳起来。真的，用手摇加油真够累的，加满一辆汽车的油箱，一个人得用手摇二十多分钟，像小李这样单薄的身子，连一个车的油箱也加不满，就累得满头大汗，气喘吁吁了。全场一百多辆车，哪一天也得排大队等着。“榆木头”虽说棒，可是，连续摇上三辆车就累得够呛了。就这样，每天晚上从六点一直到十点多，这师徒俩手脚都不得闲。小李听说要用电动来代替手摇，怎能不高兴！
    这师徒俩在车间找了个旧舵轮做皮带盘，旧链子做方向节，再用四个小八字轮珠子和五米长的废自来水管做传动轴。经过三天三夜的时间，电动加油泵制出来了；可是出了问题：马力没有，干看着没法用。这时，车间一组听了，马上把一个电马达支援了他们。终于，实现了加油用电动。人只要一按电钮，两分钟就把一辆汽车的油箱加满了，全场的汽车到八点就能全部加完油了。
    这以后，开小组会时，“榆木头”发言了，他说：“这回轮着我提个建议了：咱们组在这次技术革命运动中，来个人人提建议，个个有革新好不？我保证再革他三项。”
    “好啊！”组里的人都拍起手来。青工小王还提出一个特别建议：给“榆木头”改号。结果，全组一致通过，撤消“榆木头”这个外号，另外给起了个“革新于”的美号。
