A New Stage of Japan's "Southward Advance"
Zhang Tingzheng
The signing of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, which openly antagonizes China, the Soviet Union, and the people of Asia, marks a new stage in Japan's expansion into Southeast Asia. This not only means that Japanese militarism has been revived with the support of the United States and will intensify its economic expansion into Southeast Asia, but also that Japan will act as the "arsenal of the Far East" for the United States, exporting arms and creating wars. Once something happens, it will seize the opportunity to supplement its economic expansion with military action, vainly attempting to relive the dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."

Establishing an "Economic Sphere of Influence"

Before the war, Japan constantly clamored that "the South Seas are Japan's lifeline" and finally launched the Pacific War, causing irreparable disasters to Southeast Asian countries. Although Japan was defeated, the ambition of Japanese monopoly capital towards Southeast Asia has not diminished since the Yoshida Cabinet, and it has continuously formulated plans for Japan-U.S. cooperation in "developing" Southeast Asia. One of the main purposes of Japan's revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is to further lean on the United States militarily in exchange for U.S. support for expansion into Southeast Asia. In order to use Japan to serve its war policy, the United States has always encouraged Japan to develop in Southeast Asia. As early as 1951, when Dulles visited Japan, he said: "In the future, the Japanese economy will export capital goods needed by backward countries... and import raw materials such as iron ore, crude oil, rubber, and tin, as well as grain, from backward countries." On April 4, 1959, Eisenhower delivered a speech in Gettysburg, talking about Japan's anti-communist importance in Asia, saying that Japan is the industrial "core" of the Far East, and believing that Japan and Southeast Asia are a good match, with one needing raw materials and the other needing manufactured goods, "these two regions can complement each other very well." As a Kyodo News reporter commented on this speech: "The U.S. government has finally decided to implement the Southeast Asia development plan with Japan as the core."

In this atmosphere, Japanese monopoly capital believed there was an opportunity to exploit and was overjoyed. Due to the opposition of the Japanese people, the negotiations on revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," which had been suspended for several months since December 16, 1958, finally resumed on April 13 of last year. Then, on May 13, Japan's compensation agreement with South Vietnam was announced, which was no coincidence with Eisenhower's speech.

Even more intriguing is that the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is set for ten years, and the Japanese government's long-term economic plan is also set for ten years. In instructions issued at the end of May last year regarding the formulation of a long-term economic plan, Nobusuke Kishi clearly stated that in order to establish the Japanese economy on a stable foundation, it is necessary to establish Japan's "economic sphere of influence."

Therefore, the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party announced in August last year that it would "clearly put forward the issue of developing Southeast Asia as a major national policy," which is to reaffirm "southward advance" as a national policy. Japanese monopoly capital also impatiently issued a recommendation from the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations to the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party on November 18 last year, urging them to intensify their expansion into Southeast Asia. On December 18, the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party announced a plan for Japan's foreign economic expansion, mainly targeting Southeast Asia.

With the support and assistance of the United States, since the second half of last year, Japan's Southeast Asia expansion plan, with Indonesia as the "focus," has made considerable progress. In August last year, the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry formally announced that it would develop the forestry resources of Kalimantan, Indonesia, with a planned investment of approximately 40 million U.S. dollars, and decided to send experts in February of this year for a comprehensive survey. In December last year, Japanese petroleum monopoly capital formally penetrated the oil exploitation industry in North Sumatra through an agreement to provide a 50 million U.S. dollar loan. At the same time, the All Japan Cotton Spinners' Association announced that Japan had signed a contract to process 5,958 bales of U.S. surplus cotton into yarn for export to Indonesia. According to Nobusuke Kishi's admission in a speech at the U.S. National Press Club in Washington on January 20 this year, as of September last year, Japan's private investment and loans in Southeast Asia totaled 346 million U.S. dollars, and loans to Indonesia in just a few months were almost equal to one-third of that amount. No wonder the U.S. "Business Week" published on January 11 this year said: "The focus of Nobusuke Kishi's long-term policy is Southeast Asia, especially Indonesia," "Japan believes that the best path for Indonesia is... to accept foreign technical personnel and listen to foreign opinions in economic construction," that is, to let Japan manipulate it.

In addition, in November last year, a Philippine oil company with U.S. capital invited the Japan Imperial Oil Company to assist in the development of the oil fields on Bandayan Island in the Philippines; in December, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a press release announcing a loan of 47.8 million U.S. dollars to the Philippines for the construction of the Mariquina Dam and telephone and telecommunications equipment. In India, Japan exported artificial silk weaving machinery in October last year through loans, signed a contract in November to import 2.2 million tons of Indian iron ore, and established a technology center in Calcutta, India, in December to promote the sale of machinery. In Malaya, Japan is planning to jointly request a loan from the U.S. "Development Loan Fund" with the government of the Federation of Malaya to develop the iron ore in the Rompin area. Japan's Mitsui & Co. and Malaya jointly run a sugar manufacturing company, and Japanese and Malaysian capitalists have also jointly run a deep-sea fishing and canning company. The "Malayan-Japanese Industrial Technology Consulting Office" was established in December last year, and a joint Japanese-Malaysian capital asbestos factory will be built near Kuala Lumpur in February this year.

In order to accelerate the implementation of the policy of "industrial Japan, raw material Southeast Asia" and drive Japan's exports with imported raw materials, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to develop the lacquer industry in Indochina, oil shale in Thailand, intervene in the railway and port construction and development of iron ore in Malaya, attempt to monopolize the jute industry in Pakistan, open artificial silk factories, dabble in water conservancy projects, and encroach on the fishing industries of Ceylon and Indonesia. It is particularly noteworthy that Japan is also preparing to investigate the uranium and thorium mines in Thailand and Pakistan. To this end, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' foreign expansion budget for this year has increased to 1.505 billion yen. The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry has also formulated the so-called "Tokyo Plan" this year, preparing to train a large number of technical personnel in Southeast Asia in order to obtain an export market for Japanese heavy industrial machinery. The Japanese government has established a "Special Fund for Foreign Economic Cooperation" of 5 billion yen targeting Southeast Asia in January this year. Japanese monopoly capital also requires the government to establish an "Overseas Economic Cooperation Company" to specialize in promoting the sale of Japan's surplus products. Japan is really launching a full-scale offensive in Southeast Asia.

"Arsenal of the Far East"

Japan's munitions industry was originally the core of Japanese industry and the capital with which Japanese monopoly capital started its business. Whether from the Japanese government's second "Six-Year Expansion Plan" (1960-1965) or the "Nine-Year Defense Production Plan" (1959-1967) formulated by the monopoly capital group "Japan Defense Production Research Association," Japan has decided to revitalize its military, arm itself with missiles and aircraft as the center, and attempt to use this to improve the technological level of the electronics industry, aircraft industry, and shipbuilding industry and export to Southeast Asia. The "Defense Production Committee" of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations established a so-called weapons "market countermeasure committee" on July 24 last year to specifically study the issue of Japan exporting arms to Southeast Asian countries.

Japanese monopoly capital is eager to develop the munitions industry because this can provide super profits and open up a vast market. Taking missiles as an example, manufacturing a "Sidewinder" missile can sell 2,000 semiconductor transistors; and missiles must be frequently disassembled and repaired. Therefore, according to the "Tokyo Shimbun" on December 31 last year, in order to expand missile production, the Japanese "Defense Production Committee" is preparing to contract the disassembly and repair work of missiles from the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek groups, in addition to supplying the needs of Japan's "Self-Defense Forces" for nuclear armament. Masao Kumagai, a former lieutenant colonel in the Japanese Army and current executive director of the Japan Arms Industry Association, said that exporting arms "can reduce defense costs, improve technology, obtain foreign exchange, and make (foreign countries) respect Japan" ("Defense Procurement Public Relations" 1959 New Year's Day Edition).

In fact, Japan has long used various means to export munitions to Southeast Asia. Japan's compensation to the Philippines included thirty-six Mentor B45 trainers worth 3 million U.S. dollars. It is currently preparing to manufacture another twelve semi-jet trainers for the Philippines and is accepting orders for jet trainers from Indonesia and using loans to export naval vessels. Japanese monopoly capital built a refinery for the Thai military and is preparing to accept Thai warship orders. According to the "Yomiuri Shimbun" on July 18 last year, Toyo Seiki Co., one of Japan's three major arms companies, established an armory for the Ngo Dinh Diem group in February 1958, and another Japanese company established an ammunition factory for South Vietnam in April of the same year. Japan's compensation to South Vietnam mainly involved the construction of the Loc Ninh power station and armory, and explosives manufacturing plant needed by the U.S. military base. In addition, according to the "Nihon Keizai Shimbun" on March 18 last year, the United States is preparing to order more than 37,000 military trucks from Japan within three years from the 1958 fiscal year to supply to Southeast Asian countries, and has already issued orders for 17,911 vehicles, worth 48.3 million U.S. dollars; while the United States only ordered approximately 15,000 Japanese trucks during the entire Korean War.

The collusion between Japanese and U.S. arms dealers has also become closer. The Japan Arms Industry Association and the Far East Branch of the U.S. Arms Industry Association have held two meetings on March 5 and November 6 last year. In addition to arms dealers, military responsible personnel from Japan and the United States and relevant personnel from the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry attended the meetings. At the meeting on November 6 last year, Harutsugu Suga, vice chairman of the Japan Arms Industry Association (former lieutenant general of the Army and former head of the Army Ordnance Headquarters), delivered a meaningful speech. He said that the recent progress and development of Japan's industrial strength is very significant, and this industrial strength is the foundation of "defense production" and can become its potential.

"If we can add U.S. cooperation, it can be said that its power is very great." According to his estimates, Japan can currently produce 50 million U.S. dollars worth of guns and artillery, 68 million U.S. dollars worth of ammunition, 540 million U.S. dollars worth of vehicles (including civilian use), 90 million U.S. dollars worth of torpedoes, 20 million U.S. dollars worth of underwater detection weapons, and 70 million U.S. dollars worth of aircraft annually.

In this speech, Harutsugu Suga strongly advocated the "Uemura Plan" of Kogoro Uemura, vice chairman of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, to export arms to Southeast Asia, that is, Japan uses yen to buy weapons from the United States that Japan cannot manufacture, and then the United States uses this yen to order weapons from Japan for export to Southeast Asia. According to him, in this way, "Japan saves U.S. dollars, the United States does not have to spend U.S. dollars, it can supply military aid weapons to Asian countries, and furthermore, it can give vitality to Japan's defense production." His conclusion is: "Only when Japan's defense production is substantial can it be said that Japan's defense strength has truly become a complete thing."

The Nobusuke Kishi government and the heads of the Japanese arms industry also plan to keep the money for repaying the U.S. "debts" - the "Occupied Areas Relief Fund" and the "Occupied Areas Economic Recovery Relief Fund" - in Japan as expenses for exporting munitions to Southeast Asia, giving full play to the role of the "Far East Arsenal." When Japanese Minister of Finance Eisaku Sato and Nobusuke Kishi visited the United States in September last year and January this year, they discussed this plan with the United States. It can be seen that Japan is impatient to open up a munitions market.

Military and Political Conspiracy

After the signing of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the Northeast Asian military alliance that the United States had been planning for a long time has actually been formed. The "New York Times" clearly stated in its editorial on January 17 that this treaty is "a key factor in the defense of Southeast Asia and the Pacific region." In fact, it is to make Japan the link between the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Northeast Asian military alliance. In Nobusuke Kishi's words, Japan is the "meeting point of these two regions" of the "Asian Community" and the "Pacific Community."

In fact, Japan has long participated in the U.S.'s political and military conspiracy activities in the Far East. As early as the Indonesian rebellion in 1957, the Japanese government allowed representatives of the rebels to openly engage in activities in Japan, purchase arms, and collude with the United States, which instigated the Indonesian rebellion, secretly accepting arms orders and supplying the rebels. More recently, after the United States provoked war in Laos in May last year in violation of the Geneva Accords, a large number of Japanese-made weapons and ammunition were airlifted from Japanese bases to Laos through the U.S. military. Under the direction of the United States, Japanese Ambassador Shinichi Shibusawa also served as the chairman of the so-called UN "Investigation Sub-Committee" in Laos, working like a dog for the United States. Even more recently, in November last year, Keizo Hayashi, chairman of the Joint Staff Council of Japan, and Fumio Yoridomi, head of the Third Staff Office, represented Japan in attending a secret military meeting convened by U.S. Pacific Commander-in-Chief Felt in Baguio, Philippines, and discussed the cooperation between the Northeast Asian and Southeast Asian military blocs with representatives of the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek groups and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

As for Japan's participation in the U.S.'s war preparation conspiracy in South Vietnam, it is even more obvious. The so-called "compensation agreement" signed between Japan and South Vietnam not only violated the Geneva Accords and aggravated the tense situation in the Far East, but also was a serious provocation to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. As Professor Tokumatsu Sakamoto of Aichi University in Japan pointed out, this war compensation in cooperation with the U.S. military group "will result in a fuse leading to the next new war."

When Japanese Foreign Minister Fujiyama delivered a speech in the Diet on February 1 this year, he openly said that "many countries in Southeast Asia are politically unstable." According to Fujiyama's remarks after signing the compensation agreement in Indonesia in early 1958, the way to stabilize them is "to unite peaceful and neutral countries with the anti-communist countries of the Southeast Asia Treaty." Naoto Ichimada, chairman of the "Special Committee on Foreign Economic Cooperation" of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party, said more bluntly in the "Toyo Keizai Shinpo" weekly published on December 5 last year that Japan must establish a sphere of influence in Southeast Asia as soon as possible, and Japan "exists as a member of the free world. If Southeast Asia is communist, it will be terrible. Therefore, we must unite the anti-communist forces at all costs, and Japan is the most knowledgeable country in Southeast Asia among the free countries." Japan seems to be posing as the anti-communist leader of Asia. But everyone knows that using anti-communism as a pretext to carry out aggression is a consistent trick of Japanese imperialism.

But no matter how ardent Japan's ambition to "advance southward" is, Japan's expansion into Southeast Asia will not be smooth. The United States is facing a serious financial and monetary crisis, with a huge deficit in international balance of payments. It must strengthen dumping and compete for markets, and Southeast Asia is certainly one of its main goals. Although the United States clamors for U.S.-Japan cooperation in "developing" Southeast Asia, it actually wants Japan to be its vanguard in economic expansion into Southeast Asia. Therefore, it is actually a luxury for Japan to want to obtain huge amounts of funds from the United States to "develop" Southeast Asia, and the United States is constantly demanding that Japan share the burden of "aid" to Southeast Asia and serve the United States. After the establishment of the European "Common Market," West Germany is eyeing Southeast Asia, and Britain and France are planning to strengthen their positions in Southeast Asia and will not let Japan do whatever it wants. What is particularly important is that the people of Southeast Asian countries have recognized Japan's aggressive ambitions from their own experiences. The Indonesian "Eastern Star" recently pointed out sharply that after the signing of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," Japan will re-engage in its militaristic conspiracy, that is, to solve Japan's domestic difficulties through military expansion and find markets and raw material production areas abroad. The Indian "Amrita Bazar Patrika" also pointed out that the difficulties Japan faces in selling goods abroad cannot be expected to be reduced due to the United States' promise of cooperation. "The only known result of this treaty is to intensify the Cold War in the Far East." In short, today is the 1960s of the 20th century. The people of Asia have awakened, the people of Japan have awakened, and the balance of world power has undergone fundamental changes. In the situation where the East Wind is increasingly overwhelming the West Wind, the Japanese reactionaries' attempt to fish in troubled waters by following the U.S. war policy will not have a good result.

    日本“南进”的新阶段
    张廷铮
    日本同美国签订公开以中、苏和亚洲人民为敌的日美军事同盟条约，标志着日本对东南亚的扩张已经进入新阶段。这不仅意味着日本在美国的支持下，军国主义已经复活，将对东南亚加紧进行经济扩张，而且意味着日本将充当美国在“远东的兵工厂”，输出军火，制造战乱，一旦有事，则乘机而入，以军事行动为经济扩张的补充，妄图重温“大东亚共荣圈”的迷梦。
    建立“经济势力范围”
    战前，日本曾不断叫嚣“南洋是日本的生命线”，并终于发动太平洋战争，给东南亚各国造成无法弥补的灾难。日本虽然战败了，但是战后日本垄断资本对东南亚的野心并未稍戢，自吉田内阁以来，即不断拟订日美合作“开发”东南亚的计划。日本同美国修改日美“安全条约”的主要目的之一，就是想借在军事上进一步投靠美国，换取美国的支持，向东南亚进行扩张。而美国为了利用日本为它的战争政策服务，也一直鼓励日本向东南亚发展。远在1951年杜勒斯在访问日本的时候，即曾说过：“将来日本经济将是向落后国家输出它们所需要的资本货物，……同时从落后国家输入铁矿砂、原油、橡胶、锡等原料和粮食”。1959年4月4日，艾森豪威尔在葛底斯堡发表演说，大谈日本在亚洲的反共重要性，说日本为远东的工业“核心”，并认为日本和东南亚是一个需要原料，一个需要制成品，“这两个地区可以很好的互相补充”。正如共同社记者对这篇演说的评论所说：“美国政府终于下定决心，还要实现以日本为核心的东南亚开发计划”。
    在这种气氛下，日本垄断资本以为有机可乘，欢欣若狂。由于日本人民的反对，从1958年12月16日起停顿数月的修改日美
  “安全条约”谈判，终于在去年4月13日重新恢复，接着5月13日日本对南越的赔偿协定宣告签字，这与艾森豪威尔的演说决非偶合。
    更耐人寻味的是新的日美“安全条约”定期十年，日本政府的长期经济计划也定为十年。而岸信介在去年5月底发出的有关制订长期经济计划的指示中，明白表示，为了使日本经济建立在稳定的基础上，有必要建立日本的“经济势力范围”。
    于是日本自由民主党在去年8月间宣布“明确地提出开发东南亚问题作为国家的一大政策”，也就是再度肯定以“南进”为国策。日本垄断资本也迫不及待地在去年11月18日，发表了日本经济团体联合会要求岸信介政府和自由民主党加紧向东南亚扩张的建议书。12月18日日本自由民主党公布了主要以东南亚为对象的日本对外经济扩张方案。
    在美国的支持和协助下，去年下半年以来，日本以印度尼西亚为“重点”的东南亚扩张计划获得了相当的发展。去年8月日本农林省正式宣布将开采印度尼西亚加里曼丹的林业资源，预定投资约四千万美元，并决定今年2月派遣专家进行全面的勘探。去年12月日本石油垄断资本已通过提供五千万美元贷款的协定，正式渗入北苏门答腊的石油开采业。与此同时，全日本棉纺纱协会宣布，日本已签订了一个把五千九百五十八包美国剩余棉花加工成棉纱输往印度尼西亚的合同。据岸信介今年1月20日在华盛顿美国新闻俱乐部发表演说时自供，截至去年9月为止，日本对东南亚的私人投资和贷款等总共为三亿四千六百万美元，而数月之中对印度尼西亚的贷款已几乎等于其三分之一。无怪乎今年1月11日出版的美国“商业周刊”说：“岸信介的长期政策的焦点是东南亚，特别是印度尼西亚”，“日本认为印度尼西亚最好的道路是……接受外国技术人员，在经济建设中听取外国的意见”，也就是听任日本摆布。
    此外，去年11月菲律宾的有美国资本参加的石油公司邀请日本帝国石油公司协助开发菲律宾的班达延岛的油田；12月日本外务省发表了贷款四千七百八十万美元给菲律宾建设玛利鉴那水坝和电话电信设备的公报。在印度，日本去年10月以贷款方式输出了人造丝织厂机器，11月签订了进口印度铁矿砂二百二十万吨的合同，12月在印度的加尔各答设立了一所技术中心，以便推销机器。在马来亚，日本正拟与马来亚联合邦政府联合向美国“开发贷款基金”请求贷款，开发浪品地方的铁矿。日本三井物产公司和马来亚合办了制糖公司，日马资本家还合办了一家深海捕鱼和罐头公司，“马来亚日本工业技术谘询事务局”已于去年12月成立，今年2月日马资本合办的石棉工厂将在吉隆坡附近建立。
    为了加紧推行“工业日本、原料东南亚”的政策，并以进口原料带动日本的出口，日本外务省决定要开发印度支那的漆业、泰国的油页岩，插手马来亚的铁路、港湾建设和开发它的铁矿，企图垄断巴基斯坦的制麻业，开设人造丝厂，染指水利工程，并侵入锡兰、印度尼西亚的渔业。尤其值得注意的是，日本还预备调查泰国和巴基斯坦的铀矿和钍矿。为此，日本外务省今年度的对外扩张预算已增加为十五亿零五百万日元。日本通商产业省今年也制订了所谓“东京计划”，准备大量训练东南亚的技术人员，以便获得日本重工业机器的出口市场。日本政府在今年1月已设立五十亿日元的以东南亚为对象的“对外经济合作特别基金”。日本垄断资本还要求政府设立“海外经济合作公司”专门推销日本的剩余生产品，日本真是在向东南亚全面进攻了。
    “远东的兵工厂”
    日本的军需工业本来是日本工业的核心，也是日本垄断资本起家的资本。无论从日本政府的第二个“六年扩军计划”（1960—1965年）或垄断资本团体“日本防卫生产研究会”制订的“防卫生产九年计划”（1959—1967年）来看，日本已决心重振军备，以导弹和飞机为中心进行武装，并企图借此提高电子工业、飞机工业、造船工业的技术水平和向东南亚进行输出。日本经济团体联合会的“防卫生产委员会”已在去年7月24日成立了所谓武器“市场对策委员会”，专门研究日本向东南亚各国输出军火的问题。
    日本垄断资本急于发展军需工业，是因为这既可提供超额利润又可开辟广大的市场。以导弹为例，制造一个“响尾蛇式”导弹就可以推销二千个半导体晶管；而且导弹必须经常拆修，所以据“东京新闻”去年12月31日报道，日本“防卫生产委员会”为了扩大导弹生产，除供给日本“自卫队”进行核武装的需要外，还准备承包东南亚条约组织以及李承晚、蒋介石集团的导弹的拆修工作。前日本陆军中校、现日本武器工业会常务理事熊谷正昭说，输出军火“可以减少防卫费，提高技术，取得外汇，并使（外国）对日本起尊敬之念”（“防卫调达弘报”59年元旦版）。
    事实上，日本早已利用各种方式向东南亚输出军需品了。日本对菲律宾的赔偿中就有数达三百万美元的美恩塔B45型教练机三十六架，目前准备再为菲律宾制造半喷气式教练机十二架，并接受印度尼西亚的喷气式教练机订货和利用贷款出口海军船舶。日本垄断资本为泰国军方承建了一个炼油厂，准备接受泰国的军舰订货。据“读卖新闻”去年7月18日报道，日本三大军火公司之一的东洋精机公司曾在1958年2月为吴庭艳集团建立了一个军械厂，另一家日本公司在同年4月间替南越建立了一个弹药厂。日本对南越的赔偿，主要是建造供美国军事基地需要的禄宁发电站和兵工厂、炸药制造厂。此外据“日本经济新闻”去年3月18日透露，美国准备自1958年会计年度起三年内向日本订购军用卡车三万七千余辆供给东南亚各国，并且业已发出了一万七千九百十一辆的订单，价值四千八百三十万美元；而整个朝鲜战争期间，美国订购的日本卡车仅约一万五千辆。
    日美军火商人的勾结，也更加密切了。日本武器工业会和美国武器工业会远东分会在去年3月5日和11月6日已举行两次会议，出席的除军火商人外，还有日美两国的军事负责人员和日本通商产业省的有关人员。在去年11月6日的会议上，日本武器工业会副会长菅晴次（前陆军中将，曾担任陆军武器本部长）发表了意味深长的演说。他说，日本最近的工业力量的进步发展十分显著，这种工业力量，都是“防卫生产”的基础，可以成为它的潜在能力。
    “如果能够加上美国的合作，可以说它的威力是非常大的”。据他估计，日本目前每年可以生产五千万美元的枪炮，六千八百万美元的弹药，五亿四千万美元的车辆（包括民用），九千万美元的鱼雷，二千万美元的水中探测武器，七千万美元的飞机。
    菅晴次在这篇演说中极力鼓吹日本经济团体联合会副会长植村甲午郎的向东南亚输出军火的“植村计划”，即由日本用日元向美国购买日本不能制造的武器，再由美国用这笔日元向日本订购武器输往东南亚。据他说，这样一来，“日本借此节约了美元，美国不必耗费美元，就能够对亚洲国家供给军事援助的武器，并且，进一步可以借此给予日本的防卫生产以活力”。他的结论是：“只有当日本的防卫生产充实了的时候，才可以说是日本的防卫力量名副其实地成了完全的东西”。
    岸信介政府和日本军火业界首脑还计划把偿还美国“债务”——“占领地区救济基金”和“占领地区恢复经济救济基金”——的钱存在日本，作为向东南亚输出军需品的费用，充分发挥“远东兵工厂”的作用。去年9月日本大藏相佐藤荣作和今年1月岸信介访美时，都曾根据这个计划同美国商谈。由此可见，日本对开辟军需市场，已属迫不及待了。
    军事政治阴谋
    新的日美“安全条约”签订后，美国策划已久的东北亚军事同盟实际上业已形成。“纽约时报”在1月17日的社论中明白地说，这个条约是“作为东南亚和太平洋地区防务中的一个关键性因素”。事实上是要日本成为东南亚条约组织和东北亚军事同盟的纽带，用岸信介的话说，日本是“亚洲共同体”和“太平洋共同体”“这两个地区的结合点”。
    其实日本早就参加了美国在远东的政治军事阴谋活动。远的如1957年印度尼西亚叛乱事件发生后，日本政府允许叛军代表在日本公开活动，洽购军火，并与策动印度尼西亚叛乱的美国勾勾搭搭，暗中接受军火订货供应叛军。近则如去年5月美国违反日内瓦协议在老挝挑起战火后，大批日本制造的武器和弹药通过美军从日本基地起飞空运老挝。在美国指使下，日本涩泽信一大使还担任了在老挝的所谓联合国“调查小组委员会”委员长，为美国效犬马之劳。更近的如去年11月，日本幕僚长联席会议议长林敬三和第三幕僚室长赖富美夫代表日本参加美国太平洋地区武装部队总司令费耳特在菲律宾碧瑶召集的秘密军事会议，和李承晚、蒋介石集团以及东南亚条约组织的代表会谈东北亚和东南亚两个军事集团的合作问题。
    至于日本参与美国在南越的备战阴谋，那就更显然了。日本同南越签订的所谓“赔偿协定”不仅破坏了日内瓦协议，加剧了远东紧张局势，而且是对越南民主共和国的严重挑衅。诚如日本爱知大学教授坂本德松所指出，这种与美国军事集团合作的战争赔偿“会产生导致下次新战争导火线的结果”。
    今年2月1日日本外务相藤山在国会发表演说时公开说，东南亚各国中“有很多在政治上是不稳定的”，如何才能稳定，根据藤山1958年初在印度尼西亚签订赔偿协定后的谈话，就是“一定要把和平中立国家和东南亚条约反共国家联合起来”。日本自由民主党“对外经济合作特别委员会”委员长一万田尚登在去年12月5日出版的“东洋经济新报”周刊上说得更为露骨，他说日本必须尽早在东南亚建立势力范围，日本“是作为自由国家的一员而存在的，如果东南亚共产主义化那就糟了。所以无论如何要把反共势力结合起来，而自由国家中最了解东南亚的是日本”。日本俨然以亚洲的反共头目自命了。但是谁都知道，假反共之名，行侵略之实，正是日本帝国主义的一贯伎俩。
    但是不管日本“南进”的野心如何炽烈，日本对东南亚的扩张是不会顺利的。美国正面临着严重的财政金融危机，国际收支的逆差巨大，必须加强倾销，争夺市场，东南亚当然也是它的主要目标之一。美国虽然叫嚷美日合作“开发”东南亚，实际上是要日本成为它向东南亚经济扩张的马前卒。因此日本想从美国获得巨额资金“开发”东南亚，实际上是一种奢望，而且美国正不断要求日本分担对东南亚的“援助”负担，为美国效力。欧洲“共同市场”成立后，西德对东南亚虎视眈眈，英、法正拟加强在东南亚的阵地，也不会让日本为所欲为。特别重要的是，东南亚各国人民从亲身体验中已经认清了日本的侵略野心。印度尼西亚“东星报”最近就曾一针见血地指出，新的日美“安全条约”签字后日本将重新进行它的军国主义的阴谋，即通过军事扩张来解决日本国内的困难，在国外寻找市场和原料产地。印度“甘露市场报”也指出，日本在国外推销商品所受到的困难不可能期望由于美国答应合作而有所减少，“这个条约唯一可知的结果是使远东的冷战加剧”。总之，今天是二十世纪的六十年代，亚洲人民已经觉醒了，日本人民已经觉醒了，世界力量的对比发生了根本的变化，在东风日益压倒西风的形势下，日本反动派企图在追随美国战争政策中混水摸鱼，是不会有好结果的。
