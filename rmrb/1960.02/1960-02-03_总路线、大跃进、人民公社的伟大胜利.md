Great Victory of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune
Bai Rubing, Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

The communique on the development of China's national economy in 1959 has been published. This is an inspiring communique and a great happy event for the people of the whole country. It solemnly announces to the people of the whole country and the whole world that China's national economic plan for 1959 has been overfulfilled, and the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and completing the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule has been victoriously realized.

China's Great Leap Forward is a comprehensive Great Leap Forward in all parts of the country and in all sectors of the national economy

1959 was a year of continuing the Great Leap Forward on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, and the speed of leap forward in various production and construction undertakings was quite astonishing. As early as the winter of 1955, when the upsurge of socialist transformation in China was coming, Chairman Mao pointed out: "In the future, there will be all kinds of undertakings that people have never imagined, and high yields of crops several times, dozens of times, or even dozens of times higher than the current ones. The development of industry, transportation, and exchange undertakings is even beyond the imagination of predecessors. The same is true for science, culture, education, health and other undertakings." (Page 675 of "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside") This great prediction of Chairman Mao has not only been confirmed by the practice of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, but also by the practice of continuing the Great Leap Forward in 1959. In September 1956, the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan put forward by the First Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party required that by 1962, steel production should reach 10.5 to 12 million tons, coal production should reach 190 to 210 million tons, grain production should reach about 500 billion catties, and cotton production should reach about 48 million dan. The above-mentioned main indicators have been completed and overfulfilled in 1959. That is to say, the undertakings that were originally scheduled to be completed in five years have now been completed in two years. Can such an astonishing leap forward speed and brilliant achievements be found in capitalist countries? There was no precedent in the past, and there will be no precedent in the future. In this way, as the Party Central Committee pointed out, we can greatly increase the original targets of the Second Five-Year Plan in the next three years, and we can free up our hands to strengthen certain weak links in the national economy with more effort, so that China's socialist construction can develop continuously, at a high speed, and proportionally.

The Great Leap Forward in 1959 was not a Great Leap Forward in individual regions, individual departments, or individual aspects, but a comprehensive Great Leap Forward in the national economy. The situation in Shandong is also the same. In this year, all sectors of Shandong Province's national economy achieved high-speed development. The total industrial output value increased by 28.71％, and the total agricultural output value increased by 18％; on the basis of the rapid development of agricultural production and the continuous improvement of people's purchasing power, the freight volume of transportation increased by 54.3％, and the total retail sales of social commodities increased by 13.4％; the completed basic construction investment amount in this year also exceeded the level of 1958. Other undertakings such as science, culture, education, and health have also achieved rapid development without exception.

The reason why we have been able to achieve such a great victory is due to the adherence to the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong. We can also say that the great victory in 1959 was the victory of the general line, the victory of the Great Leap Forward, the victory of the People's Commune, and the brilliant victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

The general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, formulated by the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, is a model of creatively applying the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism to guide China's construction practice. This general line is the only correct line that correctly combines the objective laws of China's economic development with the revolutionary vigor of the people, so it has infinite power.

After the decisive victory of the socialist revolution on China's economic front, the fundamental changes in the relations of production have opened up infinitely broad roads for the development of productive forces; at the same time, during the First Five-Year Plan period, we have established the preliminary foundation of socialist industrialization, which has enabled China's national economy to develop rapidly along the track of high speed. This is one aspect. On the other hand, after the decisive victory of the socialist revolution on China's political and ideological fronts, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of the people has been further improved, and the desire to change the "poverty and blankness" is becoming stronger and stronger, so the revolutionary vigor is more abundant, which is the source of infinite power to promote the high-speed development of the national economy. The Party's general line not only correctly reflects the objective law of high-speed development of China's national economy, but also correctly embodies the strong desire and revolutionary will of the 650 million people. Therefore, as soon as it was announced, it was like a key, opening the treasure house of the people's subjective initiative, making the great socialist construction enthusiasm hidden in the people play a huge power like the splitting of atomic nuclei, and promoting China's national economy to develop rapidly. The continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959 proved this with undeniable facts. Especially after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued the battle call to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the fact that all kinds of production have leapt forward and soared fully demonstrates the powerful power of the general line. Taking pig iron and coal in Shandong Province as examples: the daily output level of pig iron in August increased by 12.1％ compared with July, 52.1％ in September compared with August, 9.6％ in October compared with September, and 5.6％ in November compared with October; although it was affected by the climate in December, it still maintained the production level of November; the daily output level of coal in August increased by 14.04％ compared with July, 20.64％ in September compared with August, 5.34％ in October compared with September, and 10.13％ in November compared with October. December increased by 4.67％ compared with November.

Through this practice, we have further realized that the Party's general line is the lifeline of the people of the whole country and the soul of high-speed development of the national economy. Wherever the general line is implemented, all positive factors can be mobilized, all potentials can be brought into play, all kinds of difficulties can be overcome, and the tasks of socialist construction can be successfully realized; on the contrary, leaving this general line will inevitably bring damage to the construction undertaking. This has made the whole Party and the whole people recognize such a truth: to develop the national economy at a high speed, we must unswervingly and faithfully implement the Party's general line; adhering to the general line is victory.

The general line plays a long-term role and is the guarantee for China's continuous Great Leap Forward in construction

The most important issue in socialist construction is the issue of speed. Can China's socialist construction continue to develop forward at the speed of a leap forward? The practice of the two years of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959 has proved that we can fully achieve this. Because the Party's general line of socialist construction, which reflects the objective economic laws and the requirements of more than 600 million people, plays a long-term role, and it will play a greater and greater power; our material conditions and material foundation are also better year by year; our experience is also richer year by year. All these enable us to leap forward better. From the perspective of Shandong's situation, in 1959, the province's total industrial output value increased by 28.71％ on the basis of a 64％ increase in 1958; from the perspective of the output of major industrial and agricultural products, pig iron increased by 1.77 times, steel increased by 2.39 times, coal increased by 57.3％, power generation increased by 54.1％, cotton yarn increased by 16.2％, cotton cloth increased by 7.5％, and machine-made paper increased by 25％; from the perspective of the output of grain and cotton, although it suffered from an extraordinary drought that had not been seen in decades, grain still increased by more than 10％ and cotton increased by 12.5％. The speed of leap forward in other production and construction undertakings is also very fast.

The reason why we have been able to continue to leap forward is inseparable from launching mass movements and implementing a whole set of "walking on two legs" policies in the Party's general line. The Party Central Committee has repeatedly taught us that the socialist cause is the cause of hundreds of millions of people themselves, and only by boldly mobilizing the masses can we create a vigorous situation and promote our construction undertaking forward at a high speed. In 1959, we launched a mass campaign centered on technological innovation and technological revolution on the industrial, transportation, basic construction, and financial and trade fronts; in the vast countryside, we launched a mass movement centered on fighting drought to ensure harvest, vigorously developing water conservancy, and raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer. In these movements, the masses were full of spirit and soaring enthusiasm, they were not afraid of difficulties and forged ahead bravely, and they did many unprecedented miracles. The tenacious revolutionary will and the infinite wisdom of creation and innovation shown by the masses are the decisive factors of the Great Leap Forward. We can say with complete certainty that if we leave the great subjective initiative that the masses have burst out in the movement, it is absolutely impossible to obtain a continuous Great Leap Forward. Practice has also proved that the "walking on two legs" policy in the Party's general line is the only way to achieve high-speed development of the national economy. Because of the implementation of this policy, we have won time, maintained high speed, and various undertakings have achieved rapid development. In 1959, the enterprises of "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" made great contributions to Shandong Province's industrial construction and showed strong vitality. In the province's pig iron production, about two-thirds or more were produced by small blast furnaces below 13 cubic meters; converter steel was basically produced by small converters below one ton; about 90％ of iron ore was produced by small mines; one-third of coal was produced by small coal kilns; and half of the cement production was also produced by small cement plants. At the same time, after technical transformation, these "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" can not only achieve high output, but also achieve high quality and low cost. The utilization coefficient of the three-cubic-meter small blast furnace in Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory is often maintained above four, the qualification rate reaches 100％, the coke ratio is reduced to 0.731 tons, and the cost is reduced to 199 yuan; the 0.5-ton small converter in Qingdao Bicycle Factory uses high-sulfur iron to produce good steel, the qualification rate reaches 95％, and the utilization coefficient reaches above 25. Without these "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups," we would not have been able to obtain such great achievements and high-speed development. Therefore, in future practice, we must confidently adhere to the development speed of the Great Leap Forward and adhere to the whole set of "walking on two legs" policies in the Party's general line.

The high-speed development of Shandong Province's national economy is also inseparable from the establishment, consolidation, and development of the People's Commune. 1959 was an extraordinary year in Shandong's agricultural history. From April to October, 53 counties (cities) in the province suffered 16 hailstorms, covering an area of more than 2.9 million mu; after the summer, there was a serious drought, which lasted for more than 100 days, which was unprecedented in 30 years, and the disaster-stricken area reached more than 77 million mu (of which, the area with particularly severe disasters reached 35 million mu). If it were based on the small-scale peasant economy before liberation, and suffered from such severe natural disasters, the working people would hardly escape the fate of bankruptcy, hunger, and death. "Thousands of miles are like burning, the valley is exhausted and dead, and people eat each other" is a portrayal of this tragic scene. However, on the basis of the new organizational form of the People's Commune, not only did it not go bankrupt, but it also overcame natural disasters and won a continuous bumper harvest with an increase of more than 10％ on the basis of the extraordinary bumper harvest in 1958.

In the past year, 1,384 People's Communes in Shandong Province have rapidly embarked on the road of consolidation and healthy development after rectification. In the struggle to develop agricultural production and extract grain from nature, relying on the advantages of the People's Commune with its large organization scale, wide range of activities, and convenience for overall planning and comprehensive arrangement, the vast number of farmers have gone all out to carry out communist cooperation. With the heroic spirit of swallowing mountains and rivers and the power to turn the tide, they launched an earth-shattering struggle against nature. They leveled hills and ridges, diverted water to the mountains, and stubbornly turned saline-alkali thin land into fertile land, turning low-yield into high-yield. In farmland water conservancy construction, the small-scale water conservancy projects organized by the People's Commune have sprung up all over the province like a storm. In the past year, the province built 2.4 billion cubic meters of earth and stone water conservancy projects, which is 50％ more than the total of the previous nine years. In particular, the Weishan Hub cutoff project, which cuts off the Yellow River and locks the "Flood Dragon", was successfully completed in only 14 days. After a year of hard work, under the conditions of extraordinary natural disasters, four regions and 41 counties (cities) in the province completed the grain production increase targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Outline eight years ahead of schedule, and a group of communes and production teams also caught up with the advanced production level south of the Yangtze River. Other aspects, such as pig raising, afforestation, fishery, and sideline production, have also developed rapidly, achieving the prosperity of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery. The People's Commune has not only demonstrated great power in agricultural production, but also written a glorious page in developing commune-run industry, supporting industrial construction, and promoting transportation, commerce, culture, and health work. Why have we achieved such great achievements? The masses said it well: "The Party's leadership is the first, and the People's Commune is the guarantee." "There is no drought in the year of great drought, and the five grains are abundant and the grain becomes a mountain. If it were not for the commune's power to turn the tide, how could a lean year be turned into a bumper year?" The masses' conclusion is absolutely true.

Now, the organizational structure of the People's Commune in Shandong Province is becoming increasingly sound, its advantages are becoming increasingly significant, and its prestige among the vast number of farmers is increasing day by day. The income of the vast number of commune members has increased, the rural market has become more active, and the people's cultural and educational life has also been rapidly improved. Especially in the process of overcoming natural disasters last year, the vast number of farmers have more deeply realized that the People's Commune has greater advantages than agricultural production cooperatives, and have more resolutely linked their fate with the fate of the commune.

The victory of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought

The resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy stated: "The general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune are the manifestation of the great determination and great wisdom of the 650 million hard-working and brave people of our country, and are the products of our Party and the great leader of the people of all ethnic groups in our country, Comrade Mao Zedong, creatively combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with China's reality." Everyone knows that during the period of democratic revolution and socialist revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong, according to the specific conditions of China, flexibly applied the principles of Marxism-Leninism and put forward the famous "three magic weapons" of "Party building, united front, and armed struggle" and the general line of socialist revolution, as well as many theories guiding China's revolutionary practice, solved a series of problems in the process of revolutionary development, and achieved the complete victory of the democratic revolution and the comprehensive victory of the socialist revolution. During the period of socialist construction, the Party and the people, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, have also found "three magic weapons," namely: the general line of building socialism, the development speed of the Great Leap Forward, and the organizational form of the People's Commune. Because these new things represent the will and aspirations of the people of the whole country in a concentrated way, and correctly reflect the laws of China's socialist construction, they have shown their strong vitality and unparalleled superiority in the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959. Countless facts have proved that Mao Zedong Thought is our invincible thought, and these "three magic weapons" generated under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought are also invincible. As long as we seriously study Marxism-Leninism, study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, and unswervingly continue to adhere to the "three magic weapons" of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, we can not only guarantee the continued leap forward in 1960, but also guarantee the continuous leap forward throughout the 1960s.

Through the practice of the Great Leap Forward in 1959, the people of Shandong have further increased their confidence and determination to continue to leap forward in 1960. This is not only because our material conditions are much better than in the past, but also because we have gained rich experience in the leap forward. At present, on the industrial front, a campaign to increase production and practice economy centered on technological innovation and technological revolution is surging forward and is being carried out in depth, and has already achieved a "good start" in production; on the agricultural front, more than 8 million water conservancy construction troops in the province are bravely fighting against the cold and challenging the frozen land; on other fronts, tens of thousands of heroic athletes are also enthusiastically carrying out selfless labor. We can say with complete certainty that the situation in 1960 is better than in 1959, and 1959 was a year of the Great Leap Forward, and 1960 will be a better and more comprehensive year of continuous leap forward. At present, we have entered a new stage of socialist construction, and the tasks before us are extremely huge. As long as we advance courageously along the direction indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong, under the banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, we will surely be able to achieve more brilliant victories.

    总路线、大跃进、人民公社的伟大胜利
    中共山东省委书记处书记　白如冰
    我国1959年国民经济发展情况的公报公布了。这是一篇激动人心的公报，是全国人民的一件大喜事。它庄严地向全国人民和全世界宣布：我国1959年的国民经济计划已经超额完成了，党的八届八中全会提出的关于反右倾、鼓干劲、提前三年完成第二个五年计划主要指标的伟大号召已经胜利实现了。
    我国的大跃进是全国各地和国民经济各部门的全面大跃进
    1959年，是在1958年大跃进的基础上继续大跃进的一年，各项生产建设事业的跃进速度都是相当惊人的。还在1955年的冬天，正当我国社会主义改造高潮到来的时候，毛主席就指出：“将来会出现从来没有被人们设想过的种种事业，几倍、十几倍以至几十倍于现在的农作物的高产量。工业、交通和交换事业的发展，更是前人所不能设想的。科学、文化、教育、卫生等项事业也是如此。”（“中国农村的社会主义高潮”第675页）毛主席的这一伟大预见，不仅为1958年大跃进的实践所证实，而且也为1959年继续大跃进的实践所证实。1956年9月，党的第八届全国代表大会第一次会议所提出的第二个五年计划的建议，要求到1962年，钢产量达到一千零五十—一千二百万吨，煤产量达到一万九千—二万一千万吨，粮食产量达到五千亿斤左右，棉花产量达到四千八百万担左右。上述主要指标在1959年，已经完成和超额完成了。这就是说，原定需要五年才能完成的事业，现在用了二年的时间就完成了。这种惊人的跃进速度和辉煌的成就，在资本主义国家能找到先例吗？过去没有，今后更不会有。这样，正如党中央所指出的，我们就可以在今后三年内把原定的第二个五年计划指标大大提高，并且可以腾出手来，用较多的力量来加强国民经济中的某些薄弱环节，使我国社会主义建设能持续地、高速度地、按比例地向前发展。
    1959年的大跃进，不是个别地区、个别部门、个别方面的大跃进，而是国民经济的全面大跃进。山东的情况也是如此。这一年，山东省国民经济各部门都获得了高速度的发展。工业总产值增长了28．71％，农业总产值增长了18％；在农业生产飞跃发展和人民购买力不断提高的基础上，交通运输的货运量增长了54．3％，社会商品零售总额增长了13．4％；这一年完成的基本建设投资额也超过了1958年的水平。其他如科学、文化、教育、卫生事业等，也都毫无例外的获得了飞跃的发展。
    我们所以能够取得这样伟大的胜利，是由于在党中央和毛泽东同志的领导下，坚持了总路线、大跃进和人民公社的结果。我们也可以这样说，1959年的伟大胜利，就是总路线的胜利、大跃进的胜利、人民公社的胜利，也就是毛泽东思想的光辉胜利。
    以毛泽东同志为首的党中央制定的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，是创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的普遍真理指导我国建设实践的典范。这条总路线，是把我国经济发展的客观规律和人民群众的革命干劲正确结合起来的一条唯一的正确路线，因此它具有无穷的威力。
    在我国经济战线上的社会主义革命取得决定性胜利后，由于生产关系发生了根本的变革，为生产力的发展开辟了无限广阔的道路；同时，在第一个五年计划期间，由于我们已经建立起社会主义工业化的初步基础，这就使得我国国民经济能够沿着高速度的轨道飞跃发展。这是一个方面。另一方面，在我国政治战线和思想战线上取得社会主义革命的决定性胜利后，广大人民的社会主义觉悟更加提高，要求改变“一穷二白”面貌的愿望愈来愈强烈，因而革命的干劲更加充沛，这是促进国民经济高速度发展的无穷无尽的力量的源泉。党的总路线，既正确地反映了我国国民经济高速度发展的客观规律，也正确地体现了六亿五千万人民的强烈愿望和革命意志。因此，它一公布，就像一把钥匙，打开了人民群众的主观能动性的宝库，使蕴藏在人民群众中的极大的社会主义建设积极性，像原子核分裂一样，发挥出巨大的威力，推动着我国国民经济一日千里地向前发展。1958年和1959年的连续大跃进，都用无可辩驳的事实证明了这一点。特别在党的八中全会发出反右倾、鼓干劲、开展增产节约运动的战斗号召后，各项生产突飞猛进，扶摇直上的事实，更充分显示了总路线的强大威力。以山东省的生铁、煤炭为例：生铁8月份的日产水平比7月份增长12．1％，9月份比8月份增长52．1％，10月份比9月份增长9．6％，11月份比10月份增长5．6％；12月份虽然因为气候的影响，但是仍保持了11月份的生产水平；煤炭8月份日产水平比7月份增长14．04％，9月份比8月份增长20．64％，10月份比9月份增长5．34％，11月份比10月份增长10．13％。12月份又比11月份增长4．67％。
    通过这段实践，使我们进一步认识到，党的总路线，是全国人民的生命线，是高速度发展国民经济的灵魂。哪里贯彻了总路线，哪里就能调动一切积极因素，发挥一切潜力，战胜各种困难，顺利地实现社会主义建设任务；相反的，离开了这条总路线，就必然会给建设事业带来损害。这就使全党和全民认清了这样一条真理：要高速度发展国民经济，就必须坚定不移地忠诚地执行党的总路线；坚持总路线，就是胜利。
    总路线是长期起作用的，它是我国建设持续大跃进的保证
    社会主义建设中最重要的问题是速度问题。我国社会主义建设能不能以跃进的速度不断向前发展呢？1958年和1959年两年大跃进的实践证明，我们完全能够做到这一点。因为，反映客观经济规律和六亿多人民要求的党的社会主义建设总路线是长期起作用的，它将愈来愈发挥更大的威力；我们的物质条件和物质基础，也一年比一年好；我们的经验，也一年比一年丰富。所有这些，都使我们能够跃进得更好。从山东情况来看，1959年，全省工业总产值在1958年增长64％的基础上又增长了28．71％；从工农业主要产品产量看，生铁增长了一点七七倍，钢增长了二点三九倍，煤增长了57．3％，发电量增长了54．1％，棉纱增长了16．2％，棉布增长了7．5％，机制纸增长了25％；从粮食和棉花的产量来看虽遭受到数十年未有的特大旱灾，但粮食仍增长一成以上，棉花增长12．5％。其他各项生产建设事业的跃进速度也都是很快的。
    我们所以能够继续跃进，这是与大搞群众运动、贯彻党的总路线中一整套“两条腿走路”的方针分不开的。党中央一再教导我们，社会主义事业是亿万人民群众自己的事业，只有放手发动群众，才能造成一种轰轰烈烈的局面，把我们的建设事业高速度地推向前进。1959年，我们在工业、交通、基本建设、财贸等战线上，掀起了一个以技术革新和技术革命为中心的群众性增产节约运动；在广大农村，掀起了一个以抗旱保收、大兴水利和养猪积肥为中心的群众运动。在这些运动中，群众意气风发，干劲冲天，他们不畏艰难，勇往直前，干出了许多前无古人的奇迹。群众所表现出来的那种顽强革命意志和创造革新的无穷智慧，是大跃进的决定因素。我们完全可以断言，如果离开群众在运动中所迸发出来的这种伟大的主观能动性，要获得连续的大跃进是万万不可能的。实践也证明，党的总路线中“两条腿走路”的方针，是国民经济高速度发展的必由之路，由于执行了这个方针，我们就赢得了时间，保持了高速度，各项事业获得了飞跃的发展，1959年，“小土群”和“小洋群”的企业，在山东省工业建设中立下了汗马功劳，表现出强大的生命力。在全省的生铁产量中，约有三分之二以上是十三立方米以下小高炉生产的；转炉钢基本上是一吨以下的小转炉生产的；铁矿石约有90％左右是小矿山生产的；煤炭有三分之一是小煤窑生产的；水泥也有一半的产量是由小水泥厂生产的。同时，这些“小土群”和“小洋群”经过技术改造之后，不仅可以做到高产，而且也可以做到优质、低成本。济南印染厂三立方米小高炉，利用系数经常保持在四以上，合格率达到100％，焦比降低到零点七三一吨，成本降低到一百九十九元；青岛自行车厂零点五吨小转炉，利用高硫铁炼出了好钢，合格率达到95％，利用系数达到二十五以上。没有这些“小土群”和“小洋群”，我们就不可能获得这样大的成就和高速度发展。因此，在今后的实践中，我们必须信心百倍地坚持大跃进的发展速度，坚持党的总路线中一整套“两条腿走路”的方针。
    山东省国民经济的高速度发展，也是同人民公社的建立、巩固和发展分不开的。1959年是山东农业史上极不平凡的一年。从4月到10月，全省五十三个县（市）遭遇了十六次雹灾，面积达二百九十余万亩；入夏后，又发生了严重的旱灾、旱象持续一百多天，为三十年来所未有，受灾面积达七千七百多万亩（其中，特大受灾面积达三千五百万亩）。如在解放前小农经济的基础上，经受这样严重自然灾害的侵袭，劳动人民是难逃破产、饥饿和死亡的命运的。“千里如焚，谷尽死，人相食”，就是这种悲惨景象的写照。然而在人民公社这种新的组织形式基础上，非但没有破产，而且战胜了自然灾害，夺取了在1958年特大丰收的基础上又增产一成以上的连续大丰收。
    一年来，山东省一千三百八十四个人民公社，经过整顿都已经迅速走上了巩固而又健康的发展道路，在发展农业生产和向大自然索取粮食的斗争中依靠人民公社组织规模大，活动范围广，便于统筹规划，全面安排的“一大二公”优越性，广大农民鼓足了干劲，开展了共产主义的大协作，以气吞山河的英雄气概和回天之力，向大自然展开了惊天动地的斗争。他们削平丘岭，引水上山，硬把盐碱薄地变成肥沃良田，把低产变成高产，在农田水利建设中，人民公社举办的小型水利工程，更是风起云涌遍及全省。去年一年全省兴修的水利工程达二十四亿土石方，比前九年的总和还要多50％，特别是腰斩黄河、锁住“蛟龙”的位山枢纽截流工程，只用了十四天的时间就胜利完成了。经过一年的奋战，在特大自然灾害的情况下，全省有四个专区，四十一个县（市）提前八年超额完成了全国农业发展纲要规定的粮食增产指标，有一批公社和生产队还赶上了长江以南的先进生产水平。其他在养猪、植树造林、渔业、副业生产等方面，也都有了迅速的发展，达到了农、林、牧、副、渔五业俱兴。人民公社不仅在农业生产中显示了巨大的威力，而且对发展社办工业，支援工业建设，促进交通运输、商业和文化卫生工作等方面，也都写下了光辉灿烂的一页。为什么会取得这样伟大的成就呢？群众说得好：“党的领导第一条，人民公社是保证”，“大旱之年不见旱，五谷丰登粮成山，若非公社回天力，歉年那能变丰年”，群众的论断是千真万确的。
    现在，山东省的人民公社组织正在日益健全，优越性日益显著，在广大农民中的威信日益提高。广大社员的收入增加了，农村市场更加活跃了，人民的文化教育生活也得到了迅速的提高。特别在去年战胜自然灾害的过程中，广大农民更加深刻地认识了人民公社比农业生产合作社具有更大的优越性，更加坚决地把自己的命运和公社的命运联系在一起了。
    总路线、大跃进、人民公社的胜利就是毛泽东思想的胜利
    党的八届八中全会关于开展增产节约运动的决议中提出：“总路线、大跃进、人民公社，这是我国勤劳勇敢的六亿五千万人民的伟大决心和伟大智慧的表现，是我们党和我国各族人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志创造性地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国实际结合起来的产物。”大家知道，在民主革命和社会主义革命时期，毛泽东同志根据中国的具体情况，灵活地运用了马克思列宁主义的原理，提出了著名的“党的建设、统一战线、武装斗争”的“三个法宝”和社会主义革命的总路线，以及许多指导中国革命实践的理论，解决了革命发展过程中的一系列问题，取得了民主革命的彻底胜利和社会主义革命的全面胜利。在社会主义建设时期，党和人民在毛泽东同志的领导下，又找到了“三个法宝”，这就是：建设社会主义的总路线、大跃进的发展速度和人民公社的组织形式。由于这些新生事物，集中地代表了全国人民的意志和愿望，正确地反映了我国社会主义建设的规律，在1958年和1959年的连续大跃进中，就显示出它的强大生命力和无比的优越性。无数的事实证明，毛泽东思想是我们无往而不胜的思想，在毛泽东思想指导下产生的这“三个法宝”，同样是攻无不克，战无不胜的。只要我们认真学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东同志的著作，坚定不移地继续坚持总路线、大跃进、人民公社这“三个法宝”，我们不但能够保证1960年的继续跃进，而且能够保证整个二十世纪六十年代的持续跃进。
    通过1959年大跃进的实践，进一步提高了山东人民在1960年继续跃进的信心和决心。这不仅因为我们的物质条件较过去好得多，而且因为我们在跃进中获得了丰富的经验。目前，在工业战线上，一个以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，正在汹涌澎湃地深入开展，而且在生产上已经实现了“开门红”；在农业战线上，全省八百多万水利建设大军，正在威风凛凛地跟严寒搏斗，向冻地挑战；在其他各个战线上成千上万的英雄健儿们，也热情洋溢地在进行着忘我的劳动。我们完全可以断言，1960年的形势比1959年更好，1959年是大跃进的一年，1960年将是更好的更全面的继续跃进的一年。目前，我们已进入社会主义建设的新阶段，摆在我们面前的任务是极其巨大的，只要我们沿着毛泽东同志所指示的方向，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社的旗帜下奋勇前进，我们就一定能够取得更辉煌的胜利。
