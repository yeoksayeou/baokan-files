    Increasing the utilization rate of transportation vehicles
    The continued great leap forward in transportation in 1959 has drastically changed the face of transportation. However, the transportation industry still cannot keep up with the rapidly developing needs of industrial and agricultural production, capital construction, and commodity circulation. Transportation remains a relatively weak link in the national economy. Therefore, under the circumstances of insufficient transportation vehicles, how to tap potential, improve efficiency, enable existing transportation vehicles to play a greater role, and complete more transportation tasks with fewer vehicles and ships has become an important issue at present.
    The Xinjiang Postal and Telecommunications Department has found a good way to solve this problem, which is to shorten the non-productive time of vehicles during transportation. They changed the old method of one person driving one car, stopping when the person stops, and the goods also stop, and implemented a new method of changing drivers without stopping the car, which greatly accelerated the transportation speed of newspapers and mails. This not only solved the contradiction between increased transportation volume and insufficient vehicles, but also freed up vehicles, opened up new postal routes, and reduced costs, and also ensured that drivers had sufficient rest and study time. It can be seen that shortening the non-productive time of transportation vehicles is a good way to achieve multiple benefits.
    The experience of the Xinjiang Postal and Telecommunications Department has universal significance. We hope that all units that can apply this experience will try it out. If the experiment is successful, it will be equivalent to increasing a huge transportation force, which can greatly increase the transportation volume of various goods.

    提高运输工具的利用率
    1959年交通运输事业的继续大跃进，使交通面貌起了急剧的变化。但是，目前交通运输业仍然赶不上工农业生产、基本建设和商品流转等方面飞跃发展的需要，交通运输仍然是国民经济中一个比较薄弱的环节。因此，在交通运输工具不足的情况下，如何挖掘潜力，提高效率，使现有的运输工具发挥更大的作用，用较少的车辆船只完成更多的运输任务，就成为当前一个重要的问题。
    新疆邮电部门找到了解决这个问题的一个很好的途径，就是缩短汽车在运输过程中的非生产时间。他们改变了过去一人包开一辆车，人停车停，货物也停的老办法，实行了换人不停车的新办法，使报刊邮件的运输速度大大加快，不但解决了运量增加车辆不足的矛盾，反而腾出了车辆，增辟了新邮路，降低了成本，而且保证了驾驶员有充分的休息和学习时间。可见，缩短运输工具的非生产时间，是一个一举多得的好办法。
    新疆邮电部门的经验有普遍意义。我们希望凡是能应用这个经验的单位都来试用这个经验。如果试验成功，那就等于增加一支巨大的运输力量，就可以大大提高各种货物的运量。
