Utilize Scattered Land to Massively Plant Oil Crops

A good news comes from Pingyuan County, Shandong Province: the county has fully utilized scattered land such as "four sides" (sides of houses, roads, canals, and rivers) and "four edges" (edges of villages, graves, fields, and ditches) to plant over 170 million castor bean and sunflower plants. Calculated by the county's total population, each person planted 219 plants, exceeding the original plan of 200 plants per person. Based on an estimated yield of two ounces of oil per plant, this could increase oil production by 22.5 million jin. Other regions across the country should follow suit.

Oil, like grain and cotton, is an important material concerning the national economy and the people's livelihood. With the comprehensive leap forward in industry and agriculture, the rapid development of science and culture, and the increasing needs of the people's lives, oil production also needs to develop at a high speed to adapt to the better and more comprehensive leap forward situation of the national economy.

To develop oil production at a high speed, first, we must resolutely implement the Party Central Committee's policy of taking grain as the key link and achieving a comprehensive leap forward, and arrange the production of oil crops in a planned way, ensuring that plans at all levels are completely consistent. Second, we must resolutely implement the policy of walking on two legs, combining the development of annual herbaceous oil crops with the development of perennial woody oil crops, combining appropriate expansion of planting area with increased yield per unit area, and especially combining large-scale planting by people's communes and state farms with mobilizing the masses to fully utilize scattered land for planting.

Fully utilizing scattered land to plant oil crops can be done by extensively mobilizing the masses and launching a mass movement. There is a lot of scattered land available in our country, and small oil crops can be planted everywhere. According to statistics from Chuansha County, Shanghai, there are about 20,000 mu of scattered land along "ten edges" such as field edges, pond edges, and house edges, accounting for about 6% of the county's cultivated land area. According to a survey by Dongwangzhuang People's Commune in Pingyuan County, Shandong Province, the commune has two dry canals, totaling 20,100 meters in length, a large dike, totaling 20,000 meters in length, and 32 first, second, and third-class roads, totaling 29,500 meters in length. A large amount of scattered land is available along these canals, dikes, and roads. Some people say, "Cities have a concentrated population and not much open space, so developing oil production has little effect." This is not entirely true. According to a preliminary survey in Beijing, if half of the open space along roadsides, riverbanks, and canal banks in the city's suburbs is utilized, more than 160 million castor bean and sunflower plants can be planted. In recent years, the suburban areas of major and medium-sized cities have been continuously expanding, and the available scattered land has also been increasing. Many of the scattered lands are relatively suitable for planting small oil crops such as castor beans and sunflowers. Planting castor beans and sunflowers on scattered land is a relatively easy task, not only can farmers of all ages do it, but also cadres of government agencies, employees of enterprises, officers and soldiers of the armed forces, and teachers and students of schools can all do it. Last year, Chongqing mobilized residents to plant a lot of sunflowers and sesame. All the sesame and sunflowers harvested throughout the year were pressed into oil, which, according to the city's rationing standards, could feed 500,000 people for a month. Utilizing scattered land to massively plant oil crops can increase the income of commune members. Dongwangzhuang People's Commune in Pingyuan County, Shandong Province, plans to increase its income by more than 1,525,000 yuan this year from planting sunflowers and castor beans on scattered land, accounting for 28.6% of the total agricultural income for the year, averaging 46 yuan per person and 196 yuan per household. Utilizing scattered land to plant oil crops also has far-reaching political significance. Through this work, teachers and students can combine education with labor, cadres of government agencies can get opportunities for labor training, and urban residents can also learn some production knowledge. This is the most vivid and practical labor production education.

Extensively mobilizing the masses to utilize scattered land to plant small oil crops is not, as some people say, a small matter. As long as you do the math, you can see that it is a big matter. The country has a total population of over 650 million people. As long as about half of the population is mobilized to fully utilize scattered land to plant small oil crops, at an average of 20 castor bean plants per person, more than 1.2 billion jin of seeds can be produced. If used for export, this could be exchanged for eight complete sets of equipment for the Luoyang Tractor Factory, or 31 complete sets of equipment for a 50,000-spindle textile factory, or four and a half complete sets of equipment for a nitrogen fertilizer factory producing 50,000 tons of synthetic ammonia per year, or 29,000 large trucks, or 24,800 tractors. At an average of 10 sunflower plants per person, 1 billion jin of seeds can be produced. If used for export, this could also be exchanged for three complete sets of equipment for the Luoyang Tractor Factory, 10,100 tractors, and so on. If these sunflower seeds are pressed into oil, at a yield of 20 jin of oil per 100 jin of seeds, a total of 200 million jin of oil can be produced, which will play a significant role in solving the problem of industrial oil and people's edible oil. It can be seen that this is a major event related to our country's socialist construction, and it is a major event related to improving the people's lives.

To fully utilize scattered land and plant more oil crops, Party committees at all levels must strengthen political and ideological leadership, adhere to putting politics in command, launch a mass movement, and mobilize urban and rural people to make plans for utilizing scattered land, and properly prepare for various tasks. Commercial departments and other departments must work together to support oil production. Last autumn, when Chongqing mobilized urban residents to plant "Oilseed Rape King," it mobilized the commercial departments to take responsibility for solving the seed problem, and distributed them in small packages, delivered directly to users' doors; scientific research departments organized lectures on planting techniques to introduce the technology of planting oilseed rape. This launched a vigorous mass movement to plant "Oilseed Rape King."

The spring planting season is approaching. Commune members of people's communes and urban residents, cadres of government agencies, employees of enterprises, officers and soldiers of the armed forces, and teachers and students of schools should immediately take action to utilize all available scattered land to plant more oil crops and plant oil crops well. In the past, we have made great achievements in this regard. This year, we must be determined to boost our efforts and strive for a greater and better leap forward in oil production.

### 利用零星土地　大种油料作物

    利用零星土地　大种油料作物
    山东平原县传来一个好消息，这个县已经充分利用“四旁”（宅旁、道旁、渠旁、河旁）、“四头”（村头、坟头、地头、沟头）等零星土地，种植了蓖麻、向日葵等油料作物一亿七千多万株，按全县人口平均计算，每人种植了二百一十九株，超过了原定每人二百株的计划，按每株出二两油计算，可以增产油脂二千二百五十万斤。全国其他地区都应该这样做。
    油脂同粮食、棉花一样，是有关国计民生的一项重要物资。随着工农业全面跃进，科学文化事业的迅速发展，和人民生活日益增长的需要，油脂生产也需要高速度地发展，以适应国民经济更好更全面跃进的形势。
    高速度地发展油料生产，首先要坚决地执行党中央提出的以粮为纲，全面跃进的方针，有计划地安排油料作物的生产，做到上下计划完全一致。其次，要坚决执行两条腿走路的方针，把发展一年生的草本油料作物和发展多年生的木本油料作物结合起来，适当扩大种植面积和提高单位产量结合起来，特别是把各地人民公社、国营农场大面积种植和动员广大群众充分利用零星土地种植结合起来。
    充分利用零星土地种植油料作物，完全可以采取广泛地发动群众，大搞群众运动的办法。我国可利用的零星土地很多，到处可以种植小油料作物。据上海市川沙县统计，全县可利用的田边、塘边、宅边等“十边”零星土地约有二万亩左右，相当于全县耕地面积的6％。山东平原县董王庄人民公社调查，全社有干渠两条，长达二万零一百米，一条大堤，长达二万米，一、二、三级公路三十二条，长达二万九千五百米，在这些渠旁、堤旁、路旁有大批零星土地可利用。有人说“城市人口集中，空地不多，发展油料生产作用不大。”事实并不完全是这样。据北京市初步调查，如果把本市郊区的路边、河边、渠边的一半空地利用起来，就可种植蓖麻、向日葵一亿六千余万株。近年来各大、中城市的郊区面积不断扩大，可利用的零星土地也不断增多。零星土地中有很多是比较适宜于种蓖麻、向日葵等小油料作物的。在零星土地上种植蓖麻、向日葵是一件比较容易的事情，不仅乡村老老少少农民做得到，而且机关干部、企业职工、部队官兵、学校师生，也都做得到。去年重庆市就发动居民种了不少向日葵、芝麻，全年所收获的芝麻、向日葵，全部榨成油，按这个市的定量，可供五十万人食用一个月。利用零星土地大种油料作物可以增加社员收入，山东平原县董王庄人民公社规划今年从利用零星土地种植向日葵、蓖麻方面，增加收入一百五十二万五千多元，占全年农业总收入的28．6％，每人平均占有四十六元，每户平均占有一百九十六元。利用零星土地种植油料作物，还有更深远的政治意义。通过这个工作，学校师生可以把教育和劳动结合起来，机关干部可以得到劳动锻炼的机会，城市居民也可以学得一些生产知识，这是最生动、最实际的劳动生产教育。
    广泛发动群众利用零星土地种植小油料作物，并不像有些人所说的是件小事，只要算一笔账，就可以看出这是件大事。全国共有六亿五千多万人口，只要其中的半数左右的人口动员起来，充分利用零星土地种植小油料作物，以每人种二十棵左右蓖麻计算，即可产籽十二亿多斤，如果用来出口，即可换回洛阳拖拉机厂全套设备八套，或五万纱锭纺织厂全套设备三十一套，或年产五万吨合成氨的氮肥厂全套设备四套半，或大卡车二万九千辆，或拖拉机二万四千八百台。以每人种向日葵十棵计算，即可产籽十亿斤，如果用来出口，也可换回洛阳拖拉机厂全套设备三套，拖拉机一万零一百台等等。把这些向日葵籽榨油的话，以每百斤出油二十斤计算，共可出油二亿斤，这对解决国内工业用油和人民食用都会起很大作用。可见这是有关我国社会主义建设的大事，这是有关改善人民生活的大事。
    充分利用零星土地，多种油料作物，各级党委要加强政治思想领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，发动城乡人民作出利用零星土地的计划，并妥善地做好各种准备工作。商业部门和其他部门要通力协作，支援油料生产。去年秋天，重庆市发动城市居民种植“油菜王”时，就发动商业部门负责解决种籽问题，并且分包零装，专程送到用户门上；科学研究部门组织种植技术讲演会，介绍种植油菜的技术。这样就掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的群众性的种“油菜王”运动。
    春播时间已经迫近，各地人民公社社员和城镇居民、机关干部、企业职工、部队官兵、学校师生，都应该立即行动起来，利用一切可以利用的零星土地多种油料作物，种好油料作物。过去，我们在这方面已经作出了很大成绩，今年一定要下决心鼓干劲，争取油料生产更大更好的跃进。
