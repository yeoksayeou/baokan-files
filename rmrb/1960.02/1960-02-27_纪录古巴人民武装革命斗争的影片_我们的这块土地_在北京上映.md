Xinhua News Agency, February 26th: The film documenting the armed revolutionary struggle of the Cuban people against the large estate system, "This Land of Ours," premieres in Beijing today. This is the first Cuban film to be shown in our country.

The film records the past conditions of many Cuban people living a displaced, impoverished, and miserable life under the reactionary dictatorial rule and the cruel exploitation of the large estate system. The film reflects that in the past, under the control of large estate owners, half of Cuba's vast and rich land was left barren. Due to the existence of the large estate system, Cuba's economy stagnated, food had to be imported in large quantities, national industries could not grow, and unemployment increased. In order to fight for the right to live, the heroic Cuban people participated in the revolution and launched armed uprisings. After seven years of struggle, they finally overthrew the dictatorial regime. After the victory of the revolution, land reform was carried out. The film also records the scenes of the Cuban people warmly welcoming the insurgent army and diligently and joyfully cultivating the land after the land reform. The last scene of the film shows the Cuban people, under the protection of the insurgent army, bravely marching forward to realize their right to live and build a happy life!

After being shown in Beijing, the film will also be shown in Shanghai and other places.

    “我们的这块土地”在北京上映
    新华社26日讯　纪录古巴人民反抗大庄园制而进行的武装革命斗争影片：“我们的这块土地”，今天起在北京上映。这是第一部在我国上映的古巴影片。
    这部影片纪录了许多古巴人民过去在反动的独裁统治和大庄园制的残酷剥削下，过着流离失所、贫穷和悲惨生活的情形。影片反映了古巴辽阔、富饶的土地过去在大庄园主的控制下，有半数被荒芜着。由于大庄园制的存在，使古巴经济停滞，食用品不得不大量进口，民族工业也无法成长，失业者日益增加。为了争取生活的权利，英勇的古巴人民纷纷参加了革命进行武装起义，经过七年的斗争，终于推翻了独裁政权。革命胜利后，并进行了土地改革。这部影片还纪录了古巴人民热烈欢迎起义军的以及土地改革后勤劳愉快耕种的情景。影片的最后一个镜头展示着古巴人民在起义军的保卫下，为实现生活的权利，建设幸福的生活而英勇前进！
    影片在北京放映后，还将在上海等地放映。
