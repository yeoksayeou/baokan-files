    Cooperate to Transport Capacity
    Transportation Department and Factories in the Eastern Suburbs of Beijing Use Unified Transportation Power
    Vehicle Stopping Time Shortened　Freight Volume Greatly Increased　Guaranteeing Production Leap Forward
    (Our reporter Zhou Dingfang reports) The railway and highway transportation departments and factories and enterprises in the eastern suburbs of Beijing, carrying forward the spirit of communist cooperation, have taken a series of measures such as unified use of loading and unloading forces, joint use of railway special lines, and door-to-door delivery, which greatly improved transportation efficiency and ensured the completion of rapidly growing transportation tasks.
    The eastern suburbs are the industrial area of Beijing, with more than 200 factories and enterprises handling freight business at the eastern suburbs station. Due to the rapid development of production and construction, although a lot of transportation equipment has been added in recent years, it still cannot meet the needs of the increasing transportation volume. In order to solve the contradiction between freight volume and insufficient transportation equipment, the railway and highway transportation departments and factories and enterprises in this area had previously established joint office collaboration organizations. However, due to insufficient political leadership, they only relied on signing contracts and establishing regulations to restrain each other. Therefore, the cooperation was not successful, and the situation of transportation lagging behind production was not quickly reversed.
    Since the Great Leap Forward, the contradiction between transport volume and transport capacity has become more prominent. The Chaoyang District Committee of the Communist Party of China, which leads this area, after investigation and research, believes that only by carrying out reforms in the relations of production and implementing unified dispatch and unified use of the railway lines and loading and unloading forces dedicated to each unit can the potential be fully exploited and the needs of production development be guaranteed. Under the unified leadership of the District Committee, the party organizations of various units continuously organized relevant personnel to "deliberate," so that the vast number of workers clearly established the idea of "the road and the factory as one family." On the basis of unifying ideological understanding, a "one-dragon" large-scale cooperation movement of "production, transportation, and sales combined" was launched.
    Based on the spirit of "the transportation department resolutely serves production, and factories and enterprises actively create favorable conditions for the transportation department," various units have taken the following three main measures to strengthen cooperation.
    First, unified use of loading and unloading forces. Some larger factories and enterprises have a varying number of loading and unloading personnel and equipment. In the past, due to the uneven arrival of goods, the loading and unloading work often appeared to be unevenly busy and idle, often prolonging the stopping time of vehicles. Now, they have divided several small cooperation zones, and put together more than 1,500 loading and unloading personnel and all loading and unloading equipment from 24 major units in the whole area, according to the method of "small area mutual assistance, large area joint labor, unified allocation, and mutual support," unified organization, and joint use, so that the goods can be loaded and unloaded as soon as the train arrives at the station.
    Second, jointly use railway special lines. There are a total of 32 special lines in the eastern suburbs station area, most of which are used at low efficiency. The cargo spaces set up on both sides of these special lines are more empty than the cargo spaces at the eastern suburbs station by several times. However, the cargo spaces at the station often have backlogs and blockages, and heavy stacking and unloading. The implementation of the shared use of special lines is in accordance with the policy of "unified planning, overall arrangement, and rational use," and the principle of "vigorously carrying out cooperation, benefiting every family, giving priority to owners, and taking care of neighbors," organizing several enterprises in the neighboring areas to use a railway special line for loading and unloading. After converting ten special lines suitable for joint use into shared use, it is equivalent to adding ten "satellite stations," and adding more than 500 cargo spaces, which is more than three times the original cargo spaces at the eastern suburbs station.
    Third, implement door-to-door delivery without goods landing. In the past, factories and enterprises had many procedures and complicated clues for picking up goods. Now, they have jointly created a set of methods for door-to-door delivery without goods landing based on "one union, four unity, and five fixation." That is, the railway, highway, factories and enterprises are combined into a joint office, unified planning, unified dispatch, unified management of the freight yard, and unified technical innovation and technical revolution; at the same time, fixed routes, personnel, handling labor, handling tools, and unloading points by category. After the implementation of this method, the freight companies only need to go through the formalities with the joint office once, and the joint office will uniformly plan and organize the railway and highway departments to closely connect for transportation, so that the goods can be directly loaded from the train into the car and delivered to the owner's door without landing. In this way, the owners reduce the handling procedures and streamline the handling personnel. Preliminary calculations show that 103 companies can reduce 150 people specializing in transportation. The cargo turnover efficiency of the station has also been reduced from four to five days to one and a half to two days, and the daily transportation of trucks has increased from 40 tons to 60 tons.
    After the railway and highway transportation departments and factories and enterprises in this area strengthened cooperation, the contradiction between transport volume and transport capacity was resolved, the accumulation and blockage of goods were eliminated, and the potential of equipment was fully utilized. In terms of railway transportation, the average stopping time of vehicles was shortened from 12.3 hours to 8.5 hours; the loading volume completed last year increased by 24.9% compared with 1958, and the unloading volume increased by 74.6%. In terms of highway transportation, the transportation volume last year increased by 90% compared with 1958. In January of this year, the freight volume completed by the transportation department in this area increased by 7.7% compared with the highest month last year. What is particularly important is that the raw materials needed for the production of various major factories and enterprises and the products sent out by the transportation department can basically guarantee timely delivery and delivery, creating good conditions for the continued leap forward in industrial production.

    协作出运力
    北京东郊区运输部门和工厂统一使用运输力量
    车辆停站时间缩短　货运量大增　保证了生产跃进
    本报讯　记者周定舫报道：北京东郊地区的铁路、公路运输部门和工厂企业，发扬共产主义协作精神，采取了统一使用装卸力量、共同使用铁路专用线、送货上门等一系列措施，大大提高了运输效率，保证了迅速增长的运输任务的完成。
    东郊地区是北京的工业区，有二百多个工厂、企业在东郊车站办理货运业务。由于生产建设飞跃发展，近几年虽然增加了不少运输设备，但是还不能满足运输量增长的需要。为了解决货运量同运输设备不足的矛盾，这个地区的铁路、公路运输部门和工厂企业，过去就建立了联合办公的协作组织。但是，由于政治挂帅不够，只靠订合同、立规章，来互相制约。因此，协作搞得不好，运输落后于生产的局面没有很快扭转。
    大跃进以来，运量和运力的矛盾更加突出。领导这个地区的中共朝阳区委经过调查研究，认为只有从生产关系方面进行变革，把各个单位专用的铁路线、装卸力量实行统一调度，统一使用，才能充分发挥潜力，保证生产发展的需要。在区委统一领导下，各单位的党组织不断组织有关人员“务虚”，使广大职工明确树立了“路厂一家”的思想。在统一思想认识的基础上，开展了“产、运、销三结合”的“一条龙”大协作运动。
    各单位本着“运输部门坚决为生产服务，工厂企业积极给运输部门创造有利条件”的精神，采取以下三项主要措施加强了协作。
    第一，统一使用装卸力量。一些较大的工厂企业都有数量不等的装卸人员和机具。过去由于货物到达不均衡，装卸工作经常出现忙闲不均的现象，常常延长车辆停车时间。现在，他们划分了若干小协作区，把全区二十四个主要单位的一千五百多名装卸人员和所有装卸机具，根据“小区互助，大区联合劳动，统一调配，彼此支援”的办法，统一组织起来，共同使用，作到了火车到站马上就能装卸货物。
    第二，共同使用铁路专用线。东郊车站地区共有专用线三十二条，大部分使用效率都很低。设置在这些专用线两旁的货位，空着的比东郊车站的货位还多几倍。而车站的货位却经常发生积压堵塞、重堆迭卸等现象。实行专用线共用，就是按照“统一规划，全面安排，合理使用”的方针，和“大搞协作，家家有利，业主优先，照顾邻近”的原则，组织邻近地区的几个企业利用一条铁路专用线装车、卸车。把十条适合共同使用的专用线改为共用以后，等于增加了十个“卫星站”，增辟了五百多个货位，比东郊车站原有的货位增加了三倍多。
    第三，实行货不落地，送货上门。过去，工厂企业取一次货手续很多，头绪繁杂。现在，他们共同创造了一套“一联合、四统一、五固定”的货不落地、送货上门的办法。这就是把铁路、公路、工厂企业几个方面组成一个联合办公室，统一计划，统一调度，统一管理货场，统一进行技术革新和技术革命；同时，固定线路、人员、搬运劳力、搬运工具和分品类卸货点。实行这个办法以后，运货的企业只要向联合办公室办一次手续，就由联合办公室统一计划，组织铁路、公路部门紧密衔接地进行运输，使货物直接由火车上装进汽车，货不落地送到货主门口。这样，货主就减少了办事手续，精简了办事人员。初步计算，一百零三家企业就可以减少一百五十个专办运输的人员。车站的货物周转效率也由四至五天周转一次，压缩到一天半至两天周转一次，汽车由日运四十吨提高到六十吨。
    这个地区的铁路、公路运输部门和工厂企业加强协作以后，解决了运量和运力不足的矛盾，消除了货物积压和堵塞现象，充分发挥了设备潜力。在铁路运输方面，车辆平均停站时间，从十二点三小时缩短到八点五小时；去年完成的装车量比1958年提高24．9％，卸车量提高74．6％。在公路运输方面，去年运量比1958年增长了90％。今年1月份，这个地区的运输部门完成的货运量，又比去年最高月份提高了7．7％。特别重要的，是各个主要工厂企业生产所需的原料和发送出去的产品，运输部门基本上都能保证及时运到和送出，给工业生产的继续跃进创造了良好的条件。
