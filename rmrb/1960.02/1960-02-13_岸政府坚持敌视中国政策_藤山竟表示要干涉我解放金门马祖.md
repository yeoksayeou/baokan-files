Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th: Tokyo News: Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama revealed in his response to the Diet today that the Nobusuke Kishi government is conspiring to rely on the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" to interfere with China's liberation of its own territory, Jinmen and Mazu Islands.

Fujiyama, in answering questions raised by a Socialist Party member, once again insisted on the Nobusuke Kishi government's hostile policy towards China. He said that if war were to occur in Jinmen and Mazu, "it would have a huge impact on Japan, so the Jinmen and Mazu dispute is a matter of concern to Japan."

Fujiyama also said during a question and answer session at the House of Representatives Budget Committee today that the "Far East" scope of the new "Security Treaty" "refers to the sea area north of the Philippines, and its point of contact with the land is included." This is equivalent to saying that the scope of application of this "treaty" also includes the coast of Vietnam.

The issue of interpreting the scope of the "Far East" region stipulated in the new "Security Treaty" has become the focus of questioning in the Japanese Diet for several days. Nobusuke Kishi and Aiichiro Fujiyama had intended to feign a narrow interpretation of the "Far East" region in an attempt to conceal the aggressive nature of the new "Security Treaty." However, under sharp questioning from opposition parties, Fujiyama told the truth today. He said that "there is no disagreement between Japan and the United States regarding the scope of the Far East."

According to a United Press International Washington dispatch on the 9th, American officials mean by the term "Far East" "the entire East Asian region, from the Siberian coast southward through Japan, Korea, China, the Philippines, Indonesia, and the mainland countries of Southeast Asia, but not including India and Pakistan."

    岸政府坚持敌视中国政策
    藤山竟表示要干涉我解放金门马祖
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本外务相藤山爱一郎今天在国会答辩时，暴露了岸信介政府阴谋依仗新日美“安全条约”来干涉中国解放自己的领土金门和马祖岛。
    藤山在回答社会党议员提出的质询时再一次坚持岸信介政府敌视中国的政策。他说，如果在金门和马祖这个地点发生战争，“对日本有巨大的影响，所以金门、马祖的纷争是日本所关心的事情”。
    藤山在今天的众议院预算委员会上回答质询时还说，新“安全条约”的“远东”范围，“是指菲律宾以北的海域，它同陆地的接触点是包括在里面的”。这等于说，这个“条约”的适用范围也包括越南海岸。
    有关新“安全条约”中规定的“远东”地区范围的解释问题，几天来已经成为日本国会中质询的焦点。岸信介和藤山爱一郎本想假意缩小解释“远东”地区的范围，妄图掩盖新“安全条约”的侵略本质。但是在在野党派的尖锐质询下，藤山今天说了实话。他说“关于远东的范围，日美两国没有分歧”。
    据合众国际社华盛顿9日消息说，美国官员用“远东”这个字眼的意思是指“整个东亚地区，从西伯利亚海岸向南经过日本、朝鲜、中国、菲律宾、印度尼西亚和东南亚的大陆国家，但不包括印度和巴基斯坦”。
