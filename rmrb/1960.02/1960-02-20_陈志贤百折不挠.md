Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 18th: Chen Zhixian, an electrician at Shanghai State-owned Cotton Factory No. 4, recently completed a set of automatic control lighting equipment after three years of effort.

This automatic control lighting equipment, which can automatically illuminate lights at night and extinguish them at dawn, is the result of 133 trials by Chen Zhixian. The automatic control lighting equipment can also adjust and control the light intensity according to people's needs, so that the lights in different workshops can automatically illuminate or extinguish at different light intensities.

Chen Zhixian and two technicians sent by the factory Party committee to help him with the experiments began to create the automatic control lighting equipment without any technical data. According to their own conceived structure, they first manufactured the key component of the automatic control lighting equipment—a special battery. In his spare time, Chen Zhixian continuously experimented with extracting and manufacturing the materials for this battery. During the experiments, he deeply felt that he only had a primary school education, and that to climb the peak of science and technology, he must master science and technology. In addition to consulting experts from relevant scientific research units, he also read a large number of technical books and completed all the courses of junior high school in one year.

After dozens of experiments, Chen Zhixian and others made the first battery made of special materials. However, its ability to sense light was very weak, and it could only generate a very small amount of current, far from meeting the predetermined requirements. At this time, one technician disappointedly gave up the experimental work. However, Chen Zhixian believed that as long as there is current, there is hope, and decided to continue the experiment. He and another technician studied the reasons for the failure and finally made a special battery that met the requirements.

However, there were still many difficulties in making automatic control lighting equipment. For example, the problem of the arrangement of the circuits in the instrument, and how the lighting equipment can automatically illuminate or extinguish according to people's needs. These problems could not be solved by Chen Zhixian and his companions after many experiments. At this time, another technician also left him. This technician believed that: "The automatic control lighting equipment cannot be found in science and technology books, and we will not be able to make it successfully." The factory Party committee and the factory director encouraged Chen Zhixian to persevere. The workers in the factory were also very concerned about his experimental work. In this way, Chen Zhixian was full of strength. He drew more than one hundred sketches of the structure and circuit of the instrument, and continued to conduct experiments. As a result, when he recently experimented for the 133rd time, he finally succeeded.

    陈志贤百折不挠
    他试验了一百三十三次，制成一套自动控制照明仪，能使电灯黑夜自动放光，天明自动熄灭
    据新华社上海18日电上海国棉四厂电工陈志贤经过三年的努力，在最近制成一套自动控制照明仪。
    这种能够使电灯在黑夜里自动放光、天明自动熄灭的自动控制照明仪，是陈志贤经过一百三十三次试验才成功的。自动控制照明仪还能够按照人们需要的光度加以调节控制，使不同车间的电灯，在不同的光度下自动放光或自动熄灭。
    陈志贤和工厂党委派来帮助他一起试验的两个技术人员是在没有技术资料的条件下，开始创制自动控制照明仪的。他们按照自己设想的结构，首先制造自动控制照明仪中的关键部件——特种电池。陈志贤在业余时间，不间断地试验提炼制造这种电池的材料。在试验中，他深深感到自己还只有小学的文化水平，要攀登科学技术的高峰，必须掌握科学技术。他除开向有关科学研究单位的专家请教以外，还阅读了大批技术书籍，并在一年内就突击学完了初中的全部课程。
    在经过几十次的试验以后，陈志贤等做出了第一个用特种材料制成的电池。但是它的感应光的能力很微弱，只能产生微量的电流，远不能达到预定的要求。这时候，一个技术人员失望地放弃了试验工作。可是，陈志贤认为：既有电流，就有希望，决定继续试验下去。他和另一个技术人员研究了失败的原因，终于制成了一个符合要求的特种电池。
    但是要制成自动控制照明仪，还有许多困难。例如仪器里线路安排的问题，照明设备如何按照人们的需要自动放光或熄灭问题。这些问题都是陈志贤和他的同伴，经过多次的试验不能解决的问题。这时候，另一个技术人员也离开了他。这个技术人员认为：“自动控制照明仪是在科技书上找不到根据的，我们也是做不成功的。”工厂党委和厂长鼓励陈志贤坚持搞下去。厂里的工人也很关心他的试验工作。这样，陈志贤浑身充满了力量。他一连画出了一百多张仪器的结构和线路的草图，继续不断地进行试验。结果，当他在最近试验到第一百三十三次的时候，终于获得成功。
