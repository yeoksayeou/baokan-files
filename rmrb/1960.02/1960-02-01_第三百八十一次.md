The 381st experiment began.

The continuous casting machine, like a magnet, attracted onlookers, surrounding it completely. The head of the experiment group, veteran foundry worker Zhang Xi'an, signaled to the person pouring the molten iron. The molten iron in the ladle, like a silver snake, drilled straight into the casting machine. Veteran fitter Li Guoxin followed by moving a control lever, and the base of the casting machine slowly descended. A shiny, golden cast iron pipe extended like it was being pulled like noodles. In just over three minutes, an iron pipe with a diameter of 100 centimeters and a length of four meters was cast.

Ambition

The road to creating a continuous casting machine was full of twists and turns.

Veteran fitter Hu Enshan stared intently at a picture.

This picture, clipped from a pictorial magazine, depicted the imagined appearance of a continuous casting machine and was the only "resource" the Anshan Iron and Steel Works' cast pipe factory had for researching continuous casting. The picture only showed a frame with a machine on it. As for what was inside the machine, there was no way to even guess. As early as 1953, an engineer in the factory had designed a continuous casting machine based on this "resource." After several unsuccessful attempts to cast iron pipes, the machine was scrapped. Now, veteran fitter Hu Enshan was going to redesign the continuous casting machine based on this "resource" again. One can imagine how many difficulties there would be.

Determination

After the experiment began, there were repeated failures.

In the first experiment, molten iron was poured in, but molten iron still came out. Only a pipe head less than an inch long was cast. At the time, some people said: If you have a pipe head, you don't have to worry about not having a pipe. After searching around, someone suggested that the crystallizer might be too short and suggested raising it. As the crystallizer was raised, the pipe head became longer, but what was cast was still not a complete iron pipe. In this way, after more than two hundred experiments, only a pipe head was still cast. Some people began to waver, thinking that all the methods had been exhausted and there was no hope of casting a pipe. As soon as ideological problems were discovered, Chen Fangyao, the factory's Party Committee Secretary, stayed at the experimental site day and night, working with the workers to find the reasons and solutions, and personally participating in the experiments. Suddenly, there was even a time when not even a pipe head could be pulled out, and the molten iron was stuck inside the crystallizer, about to solidify in a few minutes. In the nick of time, Secretary Chen fearlessly picked up a wrench and unscrewed the bolts to rescue the casting machine. Under the leadership of the Party Committee Secretary, after an intense battle, the continuous casting machine was finally rescued. Secretary Chen wiped his sweat and chaired a meeting. He enthusiastically encouraged everyone, saying: We must keep working. Failure is not terrible; what is terrible is losing heart.

Perfection

After more than a hundred more failures, the pipe was finally cast, but what about the quality?

Everyone looked and felt it, and they were all confident that "there was no problem." But when a water pressure test was performed, problems arose. As soon as the pointer on the water pressure gauge pointed to the number five, "sweat" began to appear on the pipe's surface. As the pointer of the water pressure gauge moved, "sweat" dripped down drop by drop.

The impatient Li Guoxin, wielding a several-pound hammer, smashed the pipe on the spot. People picked up pieces of the fragments and began to ponder the cause of the leak. Technician Zhu Shuyao, after observing several pieces, found that the crystallization was coarse where the leak was, so he theoretically enlightened everyone, saying: The places where the pipe leaks have particularly coarse iron crystallization, which may be... Then, one person said something, and another person said something, and nine solutions were proposed on the spot.

The experiment to improve quality then began. Each of the nine methods was tested one by one, and Zhu Shuyao took detailed records of each time and brought them back in the evening to compare, analyze, and study. Although the leaks in the pipes cast each time were gradually decreasing, after the tenth improvement of the iron tapping spout, the quality of the cast pipe had reached the quality standard. But they were not satisfied with this.

In the last experiment, before the pipe had even cooled down, they carried it to test the water pressure. When the pointer of the water pressure gauge finally pointed to forty-five atmospheres, they could not find a single place where water seeped out. The quality of the pipe was more than twice as high as the standard. Their own water pressure equipment could only reach a maximum of forty-five atmospheres. At this time, someone suggested: Send it to Anshan Seamless Steel Tube Factory for testing to see how much pressure it can withstand? In the Anshan Seamless Steel Tube Factory, the pipe withstood a pressure of two hundred atmospheres, and before the pipe wall broke, they still couldn't find any place where water seeped out.

    第三百八十一次
    本报记者　白林材　王殿学
    第三百八十一次试验开始了。
    连续铸管机，像一块磁石，吸引着参观的人们，把它围得水泄不通。只见试验小组长、老铸工张锡安，向倒铁水的人一招手，铁水包里的铁水，像一条银蛇一样，劲直地往铸管机里钻。老钳工李国信，跟着一搬闸把，铸管机的底盘，随着徐徐下落，金光耀眼的铸铁管，像是抻面似地延长着，前后只用了三分多钟，一根直径一百厘米、四米长的铁管就铸出来了。
    壮志
    创造连续铸管机的道路是曲折的。
    老钳工胡恩善，出神地凝视着一幅图片。
    这幅从画报上剪下来的图片，画着幻想中的连续铸管机外形，是鞍钢铸管厂研究连续铸管的唯一“资料”。画上只有一个架子，架子上有一个机器，至于机器里边是什么样，真是连一点边都摸不着。早在1953年，工厂里有一位工程师，曾经根据这份“资料”，设计了一种连续铸管机，试验几次铸不出铁管来，后来就把机器毁掉了。这回老钳工胡恩善，又要根据这份“资料”，重新设计连续铸管机，可以设想会有多少困难啊。
    决心
    试验开始后，就一次接着一次失败。
    第一次试验时，上面倒进去的是铁水，下面出来的还是铁水，只铸成一个不到一寸长的管子头。当时有人说：有了管子头，就不愁没有管子。找来找去，有人发现，可能是结晶器太矮，建议加高结晶器。随着加高结晶器，管子头再加长，可是铸出来的还不是成根的铁管。这样先后试验了二百多次，铸出来的还只是个管子头。有些人就动摇了，认为办法都找绝了，算没有指望铸出管子来。一发现有了思想问题，工厂党委书记陈仿尧，就成天价呆在试验现场，和工人一块找原因想办法，亲自参加试验。突然有一次，竟连个管子头也拉不出来，铁水都憋在结晶器里面，再过几分钟就要凝固了。说时迟，那时快，只见陈书记奋不顾身，操起搬子，就卸螺丝，抢救铸管机。在党委书记带动下，经过一场激烈战斗，终于把连续铸管机抢救出来了。陈书记一面擦汗，一面主持开会，他热情地鼓励大家说：咱们还得干哪，失败并不可怕，可怕的是泄气。
    求精
    又是失败了一百多次，管子是铸出来了，可是质量怎样呢？
    大家一边看一边摸，都满有把握地说“没有问题”。等到一试验水压，问题可就来了。水压表的指针，刚一指向五字，管子的身上就冒“汗珠”了，随着水压表指针的移动，“汗珠”跟着一颗一颗往下滴。
    急性的李国信，抡起几磅重的大锤，当场就把管子砸碎，人们拣起一块块碎片，又开始琢磨起漏水的原因来。技术员朱述尧，观察了几片之后，发现漏水的地方结晶粗，于是他就从理论上，启发大家说：管子漏水的地方，铁水结晶都特别粗，这可能是……接着你一言他一语，当场就提出九个解决的办法。
    改进质量的试验，紧接着又开始了，九个办法逐个试验，每次朱述尧都做详细的记录，晚间还带回去对比着分析研究。虽然每次铸出来的管子，漏水的地方都在逐渐减少，在第十次改进了铁口之后，铸管的质量已经达到了质量标准。可是他们并不以此为满足。
    最后一次试验时，还没等管子凉透呢，他们就抬着去试验水压，当水压表的指针，最后指向四十五个大气压力时，竟没找到有一处渗水的地方，管子的质量比标准提高一倍多。他们自己的水压设备，最大只打到四十五个气压，这时有人建议：送到鞍钢无缝钢管厂去试验，看看到底能经得住多大压力？在鞍钢无缝钢管厂里，这根管子经受的压力，竟达到二百个大气压力，在管壁没有破裂之前，还是没找到有渗水的地方。
