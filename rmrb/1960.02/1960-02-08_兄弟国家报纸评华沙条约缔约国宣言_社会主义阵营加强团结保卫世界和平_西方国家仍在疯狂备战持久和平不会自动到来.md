Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th: Soviet newspapers "Izvestia," "Trud," "Air Force Newspaper," and "Naval Newspaper" all published editorials today commenting on the Warsaw Treaty Member States' Declaration.

"Izvestia's" editorial stated that this call from socialist countries is filled with confidence in their own strength and a sincere will to end the "Cold War." At present, the socialist world has a decisive influence on the fate of mankind, an influence that aims for a noble purpose: to strive for lasting peace, for international security, and for the peaceful labor of all countries.

The editorial said that the governments of socialist countries clearly understand that lasting peace will not automatically fall into the lap of mankind like a ripe fruit. The leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Central Treaty Organization are still frantically preparing for war. The powerful socialist camp has set a noble example, but while they are beating swords into plowshares, they are warning those adventurers that whoever picks up a sword to resolve international disputes will die by the sword.

"Trud's" editorial stated that the Moscow meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty has made a new contribution to the cause of consolidating peace.

The editorial said that the meeting once again demonstrated the complete unanimity of all countries in the socialist camp on major international issues, their firm and unwavering unity, and their unbreakable fraternal friendship and mutual cooperation.

The editorial pointed out that the enemies of peace are trying to push mankind backward, to the brink of war, but now the forces of peace far outweigh the forces of war.

"Air Force Newspaper's" editorial stated that the Moscow meeting was the most important international event. The editorial said that Western countries and imperialist blocs are still stubbornly opposing the easing of international tensions. The member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization not only continue to maintain large armies but are also increasing their numbers. The military leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are still arming West Germany with missiles and atomic weapons. The activities of Japanese militarist forces should also not be ignored.

The editorial said that Soviet soldiers, like all Soviet people, vigilantly defend the interests of the socialist motherland.

"Naval Newspaper's" editorial stated that the declaration vividly reflects the great victories and the continuous growth of the power of the socialist camp.

The editorial said that in recent years, major changes have taken place in the balance of power on the international stage, and these changes are increasingly favorable to socialism. At present, a situation has been formed in the world in which any aggressive country attempting to resolve international disputes by force and embarking on the road to war will lead to the rapid and complete destruction of the violators of peace. The armed forces of the Warsaw Treaty Member States defend the creative labor and security of the countries of the socialist camp. The armies of the socialist countries are equipped with powerful modern military technology that can crush any aggressor.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 6th: The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published an editorial today stating that the Warsaw Treaty Member States' Declaration once again demonstrates the consistency of views of the brotherly countries on major issues in the current international situation. It expresses the unwavering determination of our countries to further strengthen the fraternal friendship between each other and the sincere desire to strive for lasting peace for all mankind.

When discussing the measures taken by the Warsaw Treaty Member States in disarmament, the editorial pointed out that the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Central Treaty Organization, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and their followers are further advancing toward the arms race. Facts show that they lack the desire to confirm their words with actual actions.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 6th: The Bulgarian newspaper "Workers' Cause" published an editorial today stating that the Bulgarian people firmly stand on the peace-loving position of the Warsaw Treaty Organization and fully agree with and support the declaration of the meeting.

The editorial said that the Bulgarian Party and government have always pursued a policy of peace and mutual understanding among all countries. From this position, Bulgaria believes that in order to tirelessly strive to consolidate peace among the Balkan countries, it is necessary to establish a zone free of atomic and rocket bases, conclude treaties of non-aggression, reduce armaments, and expand cooperation in all aspects among the peoples of the Balkan countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 7th: The Hungarian newspaper "People's Freedom" published an editorial on the Warsaw Treaty Member States' Declaration on the 7th.

The editorial first pointed out that the Warsaw Treaty Member States' Declaration fully reflects the changes that have taken place on the world political stage in the last two years due to the peace initiatives of the socialist camp.

The editorial said that the balance of power has undergone a decisive change in favor of the socialist camp.

The editorial said that while deeply analyzing and studying the international situation, the meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty noted the hostile forces attempting to undermine the easing of the international situation. In recent weeks, the strength of the "Cold War" bloc has significantly increased. The countries of the North Atlantic Group formulated a ten-year plan for expanding armaments at the recent Paris meeting; provocative military exercises of the North Atlantic Group are being conducted on the border between West Germany and Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic; Eisenhower is attempting to arm the West German army with atomic weapons; West German President Lübke made provocative remarks against changing West Berlin into a free city during his visit to West Berlin; Bonn is trying its best to erase the achievements of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference and Khrushchev's visit to the United States last summer. The Warsaw Treaty Member States' Declaration powerfully exposed and condemned Bonn's "Cold War" conspiracy and called on the people and governments of the world to devote all their efforts to the task of defending peace and continuing to ease the international situation.

The editorial finally emphasized that it would be an illusion if we expect the West to follow the example of the socialist countries' unilateral disarmament after the publication of the Warsaw Treaty Member States' Declaration and to immediately conclude a treaty of non-aggression.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 6th: "Neues Deutschland" published an editorial today stating that the Warsaw Treaty Member States' Declaration is a document that demonstrates the peace aspirations of the socialist countries and their unity and strength.

The editorial, when discussing the disarmament measures of socialist countries, exposed the conspiracy of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, especially West Germany, to continue expanding its armaments. The editorial emphasized that the Warsaw Treaty Member States say with full confidence that they do not threaten anyone, but if anyone launches any attack, they will be immediately and completely crushed.

The newspaper emphasized that the basic policy of the Moscow meeting is fully in line with the policy of the German Democratic Republic. The entire socialist camp supports Ulbricht's recent letter to Adenauer.

The newspaper pointed out that the West Berlin issue is linked to a peace treaty with Germany, which is urgently needed for both the German and world people. World peace is not guaranteed until the path of peaceful development in Germany is guaranteed. The Warsaw Treaty Member States certainly cannot agree to postpone this issue indefinitely. Therefore, the Warsaw Treaty Member States' Declaration declares that if the efforts to conclude a peace treaty with the two Germanys are not supported, then the participating countries of the meeting will only conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic and resolve the West Berlin issue on this basis.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 7th: The Polish "People's Tribune" published editorials and commentaries on the Warsaw Treaty Member States' Declaration.

"People's Tribune" published an editorial saying that the Warsaw Treaty Member States' Declaration made a general analysis of the international situation. The editorial pointed out that the strength of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is growing rapidly, their economies have achieved great development, and the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States in the most difficult and complex aspects of rocket technology. Many people who have been fabricating the myth about the West's consolidated dominance in some kind of weapon for many years have been forced to understand that this is just a myth. The editorial wrote that a summit meeting could create the possibility of solving the problems of disarmament and stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons. However, in addition to this, the Warsaw Treaty Member States believe that it should also discuss the German issue, especially the discussion of a peace treaty with Germany and the West Berlin issue. The Warsaw Treaty Member States will continue to insist that concluding a peace treaty with Germany and resolving the West Berlin issue will greatly help to ease international tensions. The Warsaw Treaty Member States' Declaration warned that if this cannot be done, the socialist countries will have to conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic and resolve the West Berlin issue on this basis.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 6th: The Romanian newspaper "Spark" published an editorial today commenting on the meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty Member States held in Moscow.

"Spark" said in the editorial that this meeting, under the banner of fraternal unity of socialist countries, expressed the peace aspirations of the peoples of these countries.

The editorial said that this meeting was held at a time when the international situation was moving towards some improvement. However, the road to easing the international situation is not smooth. Influential forces in Western countries continue to stubbornly oppose the consolidation of peace.

The editorial said that the participating countries of the meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty Member States expressed a clear position on important international issues such as comprehensive and thorough disarmament, the prohibition of nuclear weapons testing, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and the holding of high-level talks.

The editorial pointed out that the Romanian people wholeheartedly support the proposals and peaceful aims of the Warsaw Treaty Organization meeting. Romania, through its entire foreign policy, makes a positive contribution to improving the international atmosphere.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 6th: "Red Right Newspaper" published an editorial on the 6th stating that the declaration unanimously adopted by the meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty Member States clearly proves that the disarmament proposals put forward by the Soviet Union to the United Nations, as well as the Soviet Union's other proposals on striving to ease international tensions, express the common position of all socialist countries.

The editorial said that the growth of socialist economic strength and technological superiority, and its unwavering peace policy, have primarily contributed to some relaxation of the international situation. The editorial emphasized that the declaration expressed the unwavering determination to force the "Cold War" knights to continue to retreat and to promote the victory of the principles of peaceful coexistence with decisive action.

    兄弟国家报纸评华沙条约缔约国宣言
    社会主义阵营加强团结保卫世界和平
    西方国家仍在疯狂备战持久和平不会自动到来
    新华社莫斯科6日电　苏联“消息报”、“劳动报”、“空军报”、“海军报”今天都发表社论，评论华沙条约缔约国宣言。
    “消息报”的社论说，社会主义国家的这项号召，充满了对自己力量的信心和结束“冷战”的真诚意志。目前，社会主义世界对于人类命运起着决定性的影响，这影响要达到一个崇高的目的：争取持久和平，争取国际安全，争取各国人民的和平劳动。
    社论说，社会主义国家政府清楚地了解，持久和平不会像成熟的果实一样自动地掉在人类的脚下。北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织和中央条约组织的领导者还在疯狂备战。强大的社会主义阵营国家作出了崇高的榜样，但是他们在铸剑为犁的时候警告那些冒险家，谁如果在解决国际争端时拿起剑来，那么他就将死在剑下。
    “劳动报”的社论说，华沙条约政治协商委员会莫斯科会议对于巩固和平事业作出了新的贡献。
    社论说，会议再次表明社会主义阵营各国对当前重大国际问题认识完全一致，坚固与毫不动摇的团结，牢不可破的兄弟友谊与互相合作。
    社论指出，和平的敌人竭力使人类倒退，濒于战争，但是现在和平力量已大大超过战争力量。
    “空军报”的社论说，莫斯科会议是最重要的国际事件。社论说，西方国家、帝国主义集团还在继续顽固地反对缓和国际紧张局势。北大西洋公约组织成员国不仅继续保持庞大的军队，并且还在增加数量，北大西洋公约组织的军事领导人还在用导弹和原子武器武装西德，日本军国主义势力的活动也是不容忽视的。
    社论说，苏联军人和全体苏联人民一样警惕地捍卫着社会主义祖国的利益。
    “海军报”的社论说，宣言鲜明地反映出了社会主义阵营的伟大胜利和威力的不断增长。
    社论说，近年来国际舞台上的力量对比发生了重要变化，这些变化越来越有利于社会主义。目前世界上已形成了这样的形势，即任何侵略国家企图采取武力来解决国际争端走上战争道路都会导致和平破坏者的迅速彻底的毁灭。华沙条约缔约国的武装力量捍卫着社会主义阵营各国的创造性劳动和安全，社会主义各国的军队配备有强大的现代化的军事技术装备，它能粉碎任何侵略者。
    新华社地拉那6日电　阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”今天发表社论说，华沙条约缔约国宣言再一次表明了各兄弟国家对当前国际形势中重大问题的观点的一致，它表达了我们各国为进一步加强相互间兄弟般的友谊的不可动摇的决心和争取全人类持久和平的真诚愿望。
    社论在谈到华沙条约缔约国在裁军方面采取的措施时指出，但是北大西洋公约组织、中央条约组织、以及东南亚条约集团的成员国及其追随者则是进一步地走向了军备竞赛。事实说明，他们缺少以实际行动来证实他们的言论的愿望。
    据新华社索非亚6日电　保加利亚“工人事业报”今天发表社论说，保加利亚人民坚定不移地站在华沙条约组织的爱好和平的立场上，并完全同意、支持会议的宣言。
    社论说，保加利亚党和政府一向是执行和平和各国人民相互谅解的政策。在这个立场上，保加利亚认为，为了不倦地力求巩固巴尔干各国间的和平，必须建立无原子和无火箭基地地区、缔结互不侵犯条约、裁减军备、扩大巴尔干各国人民间各方面的合作。
    据新华社布达佩斯7日电　匈牙利“人民自由报”7日就华沙条约缔约国宣言发表了社论。
    社论首先指出，华沙条约缔约国宣言充分地反映了最近两年来由于社会主义阵营的和平倡议在世界政治舞台上所引起的变化。
    社论说，力量对比发生了有利于社会主义阵营的决定性变化。
    社论说，华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会会议在深入分析和研究国际形势的同时，注意到了企图破坏国际局势缓和的敌对力量。最近几周来，“冷战”集团的力量显著加强了。北大西洋集团各国在最近的巴黎会议上制定了扩张军备的十年计划；在西德同捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国相毗邻的边境上进行着挑衅性的北大西洋集团的军事演习；艾森豪威尔企图以原子武器来武装西德军队；西德总统吕布克在访问西柏林时发表了反对改变西柏林为自由城市的挑衅性的谈话；波恩千方百计地企图把去年夏天所举行的日内瓦外长会议和赫鲁晓夫访问美国的成就一笔勾销。华沙条约缔约国宣言有力地揭露和谴责了波恩的“冷战”阴谋，并号召世界人民和政府全力致力于实现保卫和平和继续缓和国际局势的任务。
    社论最后强调指出，自然，如果我们期望西方在华沙条约缔约国宣言发表后就能追随社会主义国家单方面裁军的榜样，并立即缔结互不侵犯条约，那将是一种幻想。
    新华社柏林6日电　“新德意志报”今天发表社论说，华沙条约缔约国宣言是表明社会主义国家的和平愿望以及它们的团结和力量的文件。
    社论在谈到社会主义国家裁军措施时，揭露了北大西洋公约组织特别是西德继续扩充军备的阴谋。社论强调说，华沙条约缔约国满有信心地说，它们不威胁任何人，可是如果有人发动任何进攻，都将被立即彻底粉碎。
    报纸强调说，莫斯科会议的基本方针是完全符合德意志民主共和国的政策的。整个社会主义阵营支持乌布利希最近给阿登纳的信件。
    报纸指出，西柏林问题是同对德和约联系起来的，这个和约不论对德国和全世界人民来说都是迫切需要的。在德国和平发展的道路没有得到保障以前，世界和平是没有保障的。华沙条约缔约国当然不能同意无限期地拖延这个问题。因此，华沙条约缔约国宣言宣称，如果在同两个德国缔结和约方面的努力得不到支持，那么会议的参加国只有同德意志民主共和国缔结和约，并在这一基础上解决西柏林问题。
    据新华社华沙7日电　波兰“人民论坛报”就华沙条约缔约国宣言发表社论和评论。
    “人民论坛报”发表社论说，沙华条约缔约国宣言对国际局势作了总的分析。社论指出，苏联和其他社会主义国家的力量正迅速增长，经济获得了巨大发展，苏联在火箭技术的最困难和最复杂方面已超过了美国。多年来，一直在制造关于西方在某种武器方面巩固地占有优势的神话的许多人，已被迫懂得，这只是神话而已。社论写道，最高级会议能为裁军问题和停止试验原子武器和氢武器问题的解决创造可能性。但是，除此以外，沙华条约缔约国认为，它还应当讨论德国问题，特别是讨论对德和约和西柏林问题。华沙条约缔约国今后仍然坚持：缔结对德和约和解决西柏林问题将大大有助于缓和国际紧张局势。华沙条约缔约国宣言中提出警告，如果这点办不到的话，社会主义国家将不得不同德意志民主共和国缔结和约，并在这个基础上解决西柏林问题。
    据新华社布加勒斯特6日电　罗马尼亚“火花报”今天发表社论，评论在莫斯科举行的华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会会议。
    “火花报”在社论中说，这次会议在社会主义国家兄弟团结的旗帜下，表达了这些国家人民的和平愿望。
    社论说，这次会议是在国际局势走向某些好转的时候举行的。但是，国际局势走向缓和的道路并不是平坦的。西方国家有影响的势力继续在顽固地反对和平的巩固。
    社论说，华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会会议参加国对国际上重要的问题，如全面彻底裁军、禁止核武器试验、缔结对德和约、举行高级会谈等问题表示了明确的立场。
    社论指出，罗马尼亚人民衷心地拥护华沙条约组织会议的建议和和平的目的。罗马尼亚通过它的全部外交政策，在改善国际气氛中作出积极的贡献。
    新华社布拉格6日电　“红色权利报”6日发表社论说，华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会会议一致通过的宣言清楚证明，苏联向联合国提出的裁军建议以及苏联关于争取缓和国际紧张局势的其他建议，表达了所有社会主义国家的共同立场。
    社论说，社会主义经济力量的增长和技术的优势及其始终不渝的和平政策首先促成国际形势的某些和缓。社论着重指出，宣言表示了迫使“冷战”骑士继续后退，以坚决的行动促进和平共处原则胜利的不可动摇的决心。
