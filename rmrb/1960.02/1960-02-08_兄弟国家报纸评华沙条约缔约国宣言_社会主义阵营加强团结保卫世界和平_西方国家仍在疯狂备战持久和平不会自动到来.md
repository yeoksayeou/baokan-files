Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th: Soviet newspapers "Izvestia," "Trud," "Air Force Newspaper," and "Naval Newspaper" all published editorials today commenting on the Warsaw Treaty Member States' Declaration.

"Izvestia's" editorial stated that this call from socialist countries is filled with confidence in their own strength and a sincere will to end the "Cold War." At present, the socialist world has a decisive influence on the fate of mankind, an influence that aims for a noble purpose: to strive for lasting peace, for international security, and for the peaceful labor of all countries.

The editorial said that the governments of socialist countries clearly understand that lasting peace will not automatically fall into the lap of mankind like a ripe fruit. The leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Central Treaty Organization are still frantically preparing for war. The powerful socialist camp has set a noble example, but while they are beating swords into plowshares, they are warning those adventurers that whoever picks up a sword to resolve international disputes will die by the sword.

"Trud's" editorial stated that the Moscow meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty has made a new contribution to the cause of consolidating peace.

The editorial said that the meeting once again demonstrated the complete unanimity of all countries in the socialist camp on major international issues, their firm and unwavering unity, and their unbreakable fraternal friendship and mutual cooperation.

The editorial pointed out that the enemies of peace are trying to push mankind backward, to the brink of war, but now the forces of peace far outweigh the forces of war.

"Air Force Newspaper's" editorial stated that the Moscow meeting was the most important international event. The editorial said that Western countries and imperialist blocs are still stubbornly opposing the easing of international tensions. The member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization not only continue to maintain large armies but are also increasing their numbers. The military leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are still arming West Germany with missiles and atomic weapons. The activities of Japanese militarist forces should also not be ignored.

The editorial said that Soviet soldiers, like all Soviet people, vigilantly defend the interests of the socialist motherland.

"Naval Newspaper's" editorial stated that the declaration vividly reflects the great victories and the continuous growth of the power of the socialist camp.

The editorial said that in recent years, major changes have taken place in the balance of power on the international stage, and these changes are increasingly favorable to socialism. At present, a situation has been formed in the world in which any aggressive country attempting to resolve international disputes by force and embarking on the road to war will lead to the rapid and complete destruction of the violators of peace. The armed forces of the Warsaw Treaty Member States defend the creative labor and security of the countries of the socialist camp. The armies of the socialist countries are equipped with powerful modern military technology that can crush any aggressor.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 6th: The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published an editorial today stating that the Warsaw Treaty Member States' Declaration once again demonstrates the consistency of views of the brotherly countries on major issues in the current international situation. It expresses the unwavering determination of our countries to further strengthen the fraternal friendship between each other and the sincere desire to strive for lasting peace for all mankind.

When discussing the measures taken by the Warsaw Treaty Member States in disarmament, the editorial pointed out that the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Central Treaty Organization, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and their followers are further advancing toward the arms race. Facts show that they lack the desire to confirm their words with actual actions.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 6th: The Bulgarian newspaper "Workers' Cause" published an editorial today stating that the Bulgarian people firmly stand on the peace-loving position of the Warsaw Treaty Organization and fully agree with and support the declaration of the meeting.

The editorial said that the Bulgarian Party and government have always pursued a policy of peace and mutual understanding among all countries. From this position, Bulgaria believes that in order to tirelessly strive to consolidate peace among the Balkan countries, it is necessary to establish a zone free of atomic and rocket bases, conclude treaties of non-aggression, reduce armaments, and expand cooperation in all aspects among the peoples of the Balkan countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 7th: The Hungarian newspaper "People's Freedom" published an editorial on the Warsaw Treaty Member States' Declaration on the 7th.

The editorial first pointed out that the Warsaw Treaty Member States' Declaration fully reflects the changes that have taken place on the world political stage in the last two years due to the peace initiatives of the socialist camp.

The editorial said that the balance of power has undergone a decisive change in favor of the socialist camp.

The editorial said that while deeply analyzing and studying the international situation, the meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty noted the hostile forces attempting to undermine the easing of the international situation. In recent weeks, the strength of the "Cold War" bloc has significantly increased. The countries of the North Atlantic Group formulated a ten-year plan for expanding armaments at the recent Paris meeting; provocative military exercises of the North Atlantic Group are being conducted on the border between West Germany and Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic; Eisenhower is attempting to arm the West German army with atomic weapons; West German President LÃ¼bke made provocative remarks against changing West Berlin into a free city during his visit to West Berlin; Bonn is trying its best to erase the achievements of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference and Khrushchev's visit to the United States last summer. The Warsaw Treaty Member States' Declaration powerfully exposed and condemned Bonn's "Cold War" conspiracy and called on the people and governments of the world to devote all their efforts to the task of defending peace and continuing to ease the international situation.

The editorial finally emphasized that it would be an illusion if we expect the West to follow the example of the socialist countries' unilateral disarmament after the publication of the Warsaw Treaty Member States' Declaration and to immediately conclude a treaty of non-aggression.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 6th: "Neues Deutschland" published an editorial today stating that the Warsaw Treaty Member States' Declaration is a document that demonstrates the peace aspirations of the socialist countries and their unity and strength.

The editorial, when discussing the disarmament measures of socialist countries, exposed the conspiracy of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, especially West Germany, to continue expanding its armaments. The editorial emphasized that the Warsaw Treaty Member States say with full confidence that they do not threaten anyone, but if anyone launches any attack, they will be immediately and completely crushed.

The newspaper emphasized that the basic policy of the Moscow meeting is fully in line with the policy of the German Democratic Republic. The entire socialist camp supports Ulbricht's recent letter to Adenauer.

The newspaper pointed out that the West Berlin issue is linked to a peace treaty with Germany, which is urgently needed for both the German and world people. World peace is not guaranteed until the path of peaceful development in Germany is guaranteed. The Warsaw Treaty Member States certainly cannot agree to postpone this issue indefinitely. Therefore, the Warsaw Treaty Member States' Declaration declares that if the efforts to conclude a peace treaty with the two Germanys are not supported, then the participating countries of the meeting will only conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic and resolve the West Berlin issue on this basis.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 7th: The Polish "People's Tribune" published editorials and commentaries on the Warsaw Treaty Member States' Declaration.

"People's Tribune" published an editorial saying that the Warsaw Treaty Member States' Declaration made a general analysis of the international situation. The editorial pointed out that the strength of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is growing rapidly, their economies have achieved great development, and the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States in the most difficult and complex aspects of rocket technology. Many people who have been fabricating the myth about the West's consolidated dominance in some kind of weapon for many years have been forced to understand that this is just a myth. The editorial wrote that a summit meeting could create the possibility of solving the problems of disarmament and stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons. However, in addition to this, the Warsaw Treaty Member States believe that it should also discuss the German issue, especially the discussion of a peace treaty with Germany and the West Berlin issue. The Warsaw Treaty Member States will continue to insist that concluding a peace treaty with Germany and resolving the West Berlin issue will greatly help to ease international tensions. The Warsaw Treaty Member States' Declaration warned that if this cannot be done, the socialist countries will have to conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic and resolve the West Berlin issue on this basis.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 6th: The Romanian newspaper "Spark" published an editorial today commenting on the meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty Member States held in Moscow.

"Spark" said in the editorial that this meeting, under the banner of fraternal unity of socialist countries, expressed the peace aspirations of the peoples of these countries.

The editorial said that this meeting was held at a time when the international situation was moving towards some improvement. However, the road to easing the international situation is not smooth. Influential forces in Western countries continue to stubbornly oppose the consolidation of peace.

The editorial said that the participating countries of the meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty Member States expressed a clear position on important international issues such as comprehensive and thorough disarmament, the prohibition of nuclear weapons testing, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and the holding of high-level talks.

The editorial pointed out that the Romanian people wholeheartedly support the proposals and peaceful aims of the Warsaw Treaty Organization meeting. Romania, through its entire foreign policy, makes a positive contribution to improving the international atmosphere.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 6th: "Red Right Newspaper" published an editorial on the 6th stating that the declaration unanimously adopted by the meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty Member States clearly proves that the disarmament proposals put forward by the Soviet Union to the United Nations, as well as the Soviet Union's other proposals on striving to ease international tensions, express the common position of all socialist countries.

The editorial said that the growth of socialist economic strength and technological superiority, and its unwavering peace policy, have primarily contributed to some relaxation of the international situation. The editorial emphasized that the declaration expressed the unwavering determination to force the "Cold War" knights to continue to retreat and to promote the victory of the principles of peaceful coexistence with decisive action.
