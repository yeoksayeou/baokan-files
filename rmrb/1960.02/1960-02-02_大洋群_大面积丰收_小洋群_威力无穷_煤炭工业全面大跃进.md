Xinhua News Agency, 1st: 1959 was a year in which China's coal industry, having surpassed Britain in output, achieved a new and comprehensive great leap forward. In this year, the national output of raw coal reached 347.8 million tons, equivalent to 1.6 to 1.8 times the raw coal output target set for 1962 in the Second Five-Year Plan, an increase of 29% compared with the year of the Great Leap Forward, 1958, and more than 60% higher than Britain's coal output in the same year. More than 180 pairs of mines were completed and put into production throughout the year, with a new production capacity exceeding that of any previous year, even surpassing the total production capacity of all the mines put into operation during the First Five-Year Plan. In particular, the discovery of a large number of new coalfields in the south provided extremely favorable conditions for further changing the unbalanced distribution of China's coal industry.

In 1957, China's coal output was more than 130 million tons. In just two years, it increased by more than 210 million tons. This is a Great Leap Forward speed that any capitalist country could only dream of. Britain's coal production has never reached 300 million tons. After rising to 290 million tons in 1913, it began to decline. By 1958, when China's coal production surpassed Britain's, Britain's coal production was only 215 million tons, and in 1959 it fell by more than 9.7 million tons compared with 1958. Even in the United States, it took sixteen years for coal production to rise from more than 128 million tons to more than 350 million tons. In 1958, China's coal output was still more than 110 million tons lower than the United States. But the Great Leap Forward in 1959 greatly shortened this distance. In that year, the actual output of the United States was 363 million metric tons.

The brilliant achievements of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in China's coal industry in 1959 were a victory for the Party's General Line, and also the result of adhering to putting politics in command and launching vigorous mass movements on the coal industry front. In this year, the vast number of workers and staff in the coal industry system, from production, construction, design, geological exploration to the manufacture of mining machinery, all launched a vigorous large-scale high-yield red flag emulation campaign. The flowers of technological revolution blossomed everywhere, and a craze for learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward was formed, and all aspects of work were comprehensively improved. By the end of November 1959, 477 of the 1,900+ coal mining faces in the 58 major coal mines across the country had reached or exceeded the production level of 10,000 tons of coal per month, more than double the same period in 1958.

The achievements of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in China's coal industry in 1959 also further powerfully proved the complete correctness of the Party's entire set of "walking on two legs" policies. The large number of "small native groups" coal mines developed in the Great Leap Forward of 1958, after rectification and transformation in this year, continued to exert tremendous power. At present, although the number of small coal mines and the labor force they occupy across the country have been greatly reduced compared with 1958, coal production has significantly increased. Together with some enterprises originally under the management of counties or provinces, the output of local coal mines across the country in 1959 still accounted for about 40% of the country's coal output. In terms of coal washing, while building modern large-scale coal washing plants, various localities also developed many small and medium-sized simple coal washing plants last year, which more than doubled China's coal washing capacity in one year.

    “大洋群”大面积丰收　“小洋群”威力无穷
    煤炭工业全面大跃进
    超额百分之六十到八十完成第二个五年计划指标；比英国同年产量高出百分之六十；南方新煤田的发现，为改变煤炭工业布局提供了有利条件
    据新华社1日讯　1959年，是我国煤炭工业在产量超过英国以后，获得新的全面大高涨的一年。这一年内，全国原煤产量达到三亿四千七百八十万吨，等于第二个五年计划规定的1962年原煤产量指标的一点六倍到一点八倍，比特大跃进的1958年提高了29％，超过英国同年煤产量60％以上。全年建成并移交生产的矿井一百八十多对，新增生产能力超过了历史上的任何一年，比第一个五年计划期间投入生产的全部矿井生产能力还多。特别是在南方找到了大量新煤田，为进一步改变我国煤炭工业分布不平衡的现状提供了极为有利的条件。
    1957年我国的煤炭产量是一亿三千多万吨，在短短两年内，就增加了二亿一千多万吨，这是任何资本主义国家梦想也无法实现的大跃进的速度。英国历史上煤产量从来没有达到过三亿吨，它在1913年上升到二亿九千万吨以后，就开始一蹶不振，到1958年我国煤产量超过英国时，英国的煤产量只有二亿一千五百多万吨，1959年又比1958年下降了九百七十多万吨。即使是美国，煤产量从一亿二千八百多万吨上升到三亿五千多万吨，也足足花了十六年。1958年我国煤炭产量还低于美国一亿一千多万吨。但是1959年的大跃进，这个距离已大大缩短了。这一年，美国实际产量是三亿六千三百万公吨。
    1959年我国煤炭工业全面大高涨的辉煌成就，是党的总路线的胜利，也是煤炭工业战线上坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动的结果。这一年，煤炭工业系统从生产、施工、设计、地质勘探到矿山机械制造的广大职工，全都展开了轰轰烈烈的大面积高产红旗竞赛运动。技术革命之花到处盛开，学先进、追先进、帮落后形成热潮，各方面的工作都有全面提高。到1959年11月底，全国五十八个大型煤矿的一千九百多个采煤工作面，有四百七十七个已经达到或超过了月产万吨煤的生产水平，比1958年同期增加两倍多。
    1959年我国煤炭工业全面大跃进的成就，也进一步有力地证明了党的一整套“两条腿走路”方针的完全正确。在1958年大跃进中发展起来的大量“小土群”煤矿，在这一年内经过整顿改造以后，继续发挥了巨大威力。目前，全国小型煤矿的数量和占用的劳动力虽然比1958年大大减少，但是煤炭产量却有显著提高。加上一部分原来属于县或省一级管理的企业，1959年全国地方煤矿的产量，仍占全国煤炭产量的40％左右。在洗煤方面，各地在建设现代化大型洗煤厂的同时，去年又发展了许多中小型的简易洗煤厂，使我国的洗煤能力在一年内就猛增了二倍。
