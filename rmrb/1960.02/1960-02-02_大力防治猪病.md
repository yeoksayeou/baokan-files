    Vigorously Prevent and Control Swine Diseases
    In order to develop the pig raising industry at high speed, to raise pigs well, strong, and fat, all regions are actively building and repairing pens, preparing feed, improving feeding management, and ensuring the safe overwintering of pigs. These are all very important measures. In addition, there is another important measure that cannot be ignored: doing a good job in epidemic prevention, ensuring that pigs do not get sick and die, and improving the survival rate of piglets, so that the sows are strong and the piglets are fat.
    Swine infectious diseases are the great enemy of developing the pig raising industry. If an infectious disease occurs in a pig herd, if it is discovered late and prevention and treatment are not timely, it will quickly spread, resulting in groups of sick pigs and causing a large number of deaths. The epidemic of infectious diseases will also spread viruses and germs, leaving behind root causes in the pig farm, which will become a future problem. Even cured sick pigs grow very slowly, which prolongs the fattening time and increases the cost of raising pigs. Sows that have been sick will also affect the healthy development of their offspring. In short, if we relax our vigilance and allow pig diseases to spread, it will directly and indirectly bring great losses to the pig raising industry. Now, all regions are vigorously developing collective pig raising, which has created extremely favorable conditions for carrying out pig epidemic prevention and control work. However, it should also be pointed out that in the development of collective pig raising, if insufficient attention is paid to epidemic prevention work, once a pig infectious disease occurs, the speed of transmission will be faster. Therefore, it is even more necessary to pay attention to the prevention and control of pig diseases, especially the prevention of pig infectious diseases. In the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, there is a word "保" (bǎo - protect), and only by resolutely implementing this word "保" and vigorously preventing and controlling crop diseases and insect pests can we ensure the healthy growth and development of crops and achieve a bumper harvest. Similarly, in animal husbandry, we must also focus on the word "保" (bǎo - protect), vigorously carry out livestock epidemic prevention work, prevent, stop, and eliminate livestock infectious diseases, in order to ensure the health and prosperity of livestock and ensure the accelerated reproduction of herds. In order to provide a reliable guarantee for the high-speed development of the pig raising industry, it is necessary to carry out pig disease prevention and control work on a large scale. We must establish such lofty ambitions: pig farms without pig diseases must not have a single sick pig appear; pig farms with pig diseases must be able to immediately stop and even eliminate pig diseases.
    To fight against pig diseases, we must have the confidence to win and the perseverance to fight. Common pig infectious diseases in various regions, such as hog cholera, swine erysipelas, swine fever, swine enzootic pneumonia, piglet white scours, and piglet paratyphoid, are the most harmful to the pig raising industry, and we must first concentrate the greatest strength to eliminate these infectious diseases. In the past, under the conditions of relatively dispersed peasant production, relatively weak forces, and a lack of scientific knowledge, these infectious diseases were indeed very stubborn, and sometimes even rampant. Over time, many people even thought that pigs were dirty things, and it was simply impossible not to have epidemics. However, the current conditions are very different. The collective strength of the people's communes, coupled with the state's strong support for the communes, the improvement of farmers' knowledge of epidemic prevention, and the improvement of material and technical conditions, have made it possible to conquer some of the most harmful pig epidemics. After communization in Henan Province, due to the full play of the superiority of the people's communes, large in size and collective in nature, veterinary and health work has seen an unprecedented leap forward. According to statistics on December 20 last year, a total of twenty-four pig epidemic-free counties, including six counties that have been pig epidemic-free for two consecutive years, seven hundred and seven pig epidemic-free communes, and seven thousand and forty-one pig epidemic-free brigades, thus ensuring the high-speed development of the pig raising industry. The number of pigs in the province in mid-December increased by 43.1% compared to the end of October. Some pig diseases, such as swine enzootic pneumonia, although there is no preventive vaccine yet, can also be eliminated. Last year, in Kaiping County, Guangdong Province, twenty-one of the twenty-three people's communes had swine enzootic pneumonia. After eighteen months of prevention and control work, it has now been basically eliminated. On the other hand, some people have a blindly optimistic attitude towards the prevention and control of pig epidemics. They believe that after several years of veterinary epidemic prevention work, since epidemics have been greatly reduced, there is no need to vigorously carry out any prevention work against pig diseases. This is also completely wrong. The complete elimination of veterinary epidemics is an arduous and long-term struggle. Even if some infectious diseases are temporarily eliminated in some areas, there is still a risk of infection if other areas have not been completely eliminated. In 1958, Heilongjiang Province basically eliminated hog cholera, but because some counties relaxed their prevention of hog cholera last year, hog cholera recurred. This matter should be taken as a lesson by all regions.
    Currently, it is the season when sows are giving birth to large numbers of piglets, and pig diseases are beginning to occur in some areas. In order to prevent pig diseases and improve the survival rate of piglets, all regions must universally and deeply carry out the winter-spring pig epidemic prevention movement, conscientiously implement the policy of "prevention is more important than treatment," and universally carry out preventive injections so that every pig is vaccinated and immune. In addition, we must combine winter-spring manure accumulation to carry out pigpen cleaning, disinfection, and pig house cold protection and warmth. Special attention should be paid to strengthening the feeding and management of sows and piglets, raising pregnant and lactating sows well, ensuring that sows do not have abortions and piglets do not die, and providing sufficient pig sources for the greater development of the pig raising industry this year.
    The task of eliminating pig infectious diseases in the shortest possible time can be accomplished. Now we have more favorable conditions than at any time in the past. Party committees at all levels are now personally leading, taking pigs as the key, and vigorously grasping livestock production. The large-scale development of collective pig raising by the people's communes is extremely beneficial to controlling and eliminating various pig diseases. In the past, relying solely on a few veterinary personnel to carry out preventive injections in a cold and desolate manner; now, many counties and people's communes can organize thousands or tens of thousands of people to carry out a vigorous mass campaign of blitz epidemic prevention, and complete preventive injections for tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of pigs in a few days or hours, depending on the pig herd situation and different seasons. For example, from September 25 to 27 last year, Dangyang County, Hubei Province, used two days and nights to preventively inject 316,000 doses of hog cholera, swine erysipelas, and swine fever. In February, June, and September last year, Jiangsu Province organized three epidemic prevention climaxes, and the mortality rate of pig infectious diseases in the province has dropped from 0.7% in the previous year to 0.3%. Most people's communes and brigades have generally established veterinary stations (hospitals) and trained epidemic prevention teams, which have played a great role in preventing and controlling pig diseases and reducing pig deaths. The people's communes have established a large number of piglet breeding farms and implemented the policy of "self-breeding and self-raising," reducing the opportunity to bring diseases from outside by purchasing pigs from other places. In terms of the production and supply of veterinary drugs, the method of "combining indigenous and foreign methods" has been adopted. At present, in addition to the establishment of veterinary biological drug manufacturing plants in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, many people's communes have established manufacturing plants for livestock oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and other factories to produce antibiotic feed, which have a good effect on the prevention and treatment of pig diseases, especially piglet white scours, piglet paratyphoid, and swine enzootic pneumonia. With these most fundamental and favorable conditions, as long as we further strengthen leadership, on the one hand, carry out mass pig epidemic prevention and control movements, and on the other hand, continue to expand and improve the veterinary epidemic prevention team, the struggle to conquer pig diseases will surely achieve greater victories.
    The success or failure of the current epidemic prevention work plays an important role in the greater development of the pig raising industry this year. All regions must fully utilize favorable conditions, make up their minds, seize the opportunity, closely cooperate with other tasks of pig raising, and quickly launch the pig disease prevention and control movement. This is an important guarantee for the high-speed development of the pig raising industry.

    大力防治猪病
    为了高速度发展养猪业，把猪养好、养壮、养肥，各地都在积极修盖圈栏，准备饲料，改进饲养管理，确保猪的安全过冬，这些都是十分重要的措施。此外还有一项丝毫不可忽视的重要措施，这就是做好防疫工作，保证猪不病不死，并且提高仔猪成活率，做到母壮仔肥。
    猪传染病是发展养猪事业的大敌。在猪群里有一头猪发生了传染病，如果发现较晚，防治不及时，就会很快传开，出现成群的病猪，引起大量的死亡。传染病的流行还会散播病毒、病菌，在猪场内留下病根，成为后患。就是治好的病猪，也生长很慢，这就拖长了育肥的时间，提高了养猪的成本。生过病的母猪还会影响后代的健康发育。总之，如果放松警惕，猪病得以蔓延，就会直接间接给养猪事业带来很大损失。现在，各地区都在大搞集体养猪，这对于开展猪疫防治工作创造了极为有利的条件。但是，同时也应当指出，在发展集体养猪事业中，如果对防疫工作注意不够，一旦发生猪传染病，传染的速度就会更快。因此，更需要时刻注意猪病的防治，特别是猪传染病的预防。农业八字宪法中有个“保”字，只有坚决贯彻执行这个“保”字，大力防治农作物病虫害，才能保证庄稼健壮地生长发育，取得丰收；同样，在畜牧业上，也必须大抓“保”字，大搞畜疫防治工作，预防、制止和消灭牲畜传染病，才能保证牲畜健康旺盛，保证畜群加速繁殖。为了使养猪事业的高速度发展有可靠的保障，必须大规模地开展猪病防治工作。要立下这样的雄心大志：没有猪病的养猪场不让出现一头病猪；有了猪病的养猪场要能立即制止猪病以至消灭猪病。
    同猪病作斗争，必须有必胜的信心和坚持不懈的斗志。各地常见的猪传染病，如猪瘟、猪丹毒、猪肺疫、猪气喘病、小猪白痢、小猪副伤寒等，对养猪事业的危害最大，首先要集中最大的力量扑灭这些传染病。在过去农民的生产比较分散、力量比较单薄、科学知识比较缺乏的条件下，这些传染病的确很顽固，有时候还很猖獗；久而久之，许多人甚至认为猪就是脏东西，不生疫病简直是不可能的事情。可是，现在的条件已经大不相同了，人民公社的集体力量加上国家对公社的大力支援、农民防疫知识的提高、物质技术条件的改善，已经能够征服一些危害性最大的猪疫。河南省在公社化以后由于充分发挥了人民公社一大二公的优越性，兽医卫生工作出现了史无前例的大跃进，据去年12月20日统计，共出现二十四个无猪疫县，其中有六个连续二年无猪疫的县，七百零七个无猪疫公社，七千零四十一个无猪疫大队，从而保证了养猪事业的高速度发展。全省养猪头数12月中旬较10月底增长了43．1％。有些猪病如猪气喘病虽然还没有预防的疫苗，但也并不是不能消灭的。广东省开平县去年全县二十三个人民公社中有二十一个公社发生了猪气喘病，经过十八个月的防治工作，现在已经基本上消灭了。另一方面，有些人对防治猪疫病抱着一种盲目乐观的态度，他们认为经过几年来兽疫防治工作的开展，疫病既然已经大大减少，就不必大搞什么对猪病的预防工作了。这也是完全错误的。彻底消灭兽疫是一个艰巨的长期的斗争，有些传染病即便是在一些地区暂时消灭了，但是别的地区还没有彻底消灭，就还有受到传染的危险。黑龙江省1958年基本消灭了猪瘟，但是由于有些县去年放松了对猪瘟的预防，猪瘟就复发了。这件事情各地要引为教训。
    目前正是母猪大批产仔季节，有些地区猪病又在开始发生。为了预防猪病，提高仔猪成活率，各地区都要普遍深入地开展冬春季防治猪疫运动，认真执行“防重于治”的方针，要普遍进行预防注射，使猪只头头打针、个个免疫；并且要结合冬春季积肥，开展清圈消毒和猪舍防寒保暖工作；特别注意加强母猪和仔猪的饲养管理，养好怀孕的和哺乳的母猪，保证母猪不流产，仔猪不死亡，为今年养猪事业的更大发展提供充足的猪源。
    在最短时间内消灭猪传染病，这个任务是可能完成的。现在有了较过去任何时期都为有利的条件。各级党委现在亲自领导，以猪为纲，大抓畜牧生产。人民公社大量发展集体养猪，对于控制和消灭各种猪病极为有利。过去单靠几个兽医人员，冷冷清清地进行预防注射；现在很多县和人民公社可以组织几千人、几万人开展轰轰烈烈的群众性的突击防疫运动，根据猪群情况和不同季节，在几天或几小时内就完成几万头、几十万头猪的预防注射。如湖北省当阳县在去年9月25日至27日用两昼夜时间，预防注射猪瘟、猪丹毒、猪肺疫三十一万六千头次；江苏省去年2、6、9月组织了三次防疫高潮，全省猪传染病死亡率已从前年的0．7％降为0．3％。大部分人民公社和大队已经普遍建立起兽医站（院），培养了防疫队伍，对防治猪病、减少猪的死亡起了很大作用。人民公社建立了大量的仔猪繁殖场，贯彻执行“自繁自养”方针，减少了从外地购买猪只带进来疫病的机会。在兽医药品的生产供应方面，采用了“土洋结合”的办法，目前除全国各省、市、自治区都建立了兽医生物药品制造厂外，许多人民公社建立了畜用土霉素、金霉素等制造厂，生产抗菌素的饲料，对防治猪病，特别是小猪白痢、小猪副伤寒和猪气喘病有很好的效果。有了这些最根本的有利条件，只要进一步加强领导，一面开展群众性防治猪疫运动，一面继续扩大和提高兽医防疫队伍，征服猪病的斗争就一定能取得更大胜利。
    当前防疫工作做的好坏，对今年养猪事业更大的发展起着重要作用。各地区必须充分运用有利条件，下定决心，抓紧时机，紧密配合养猪的其它各项工作，把猪病防治运动迅速开展起来。这是养猪事业高速度发展的一个重要保证。
