    Continue Efforts to Run Service Stations Better
    Ren Shaochang, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Harbin XinXing Street Committee

    As early as twenty years ago, Chairman Mao taught us in the article "Pay Attention to the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Working Methods": "We should pay attention to solving the problems of clothing, food, housing, firewood, rice, oil, salt, disease and hygiene, and marriage for the masses. In short, all the practical life problems of the masses are the problems we should pay attention to. If we pay attention to these problems, solve them, and meet the needs of the masses, we will truly become the organizers of the lives of the masses, and the masses will truly rally around us and enthusiastically support us." This instruction is still of great significance to our Party workers today. Due to the development of production, the living standards of urban people have been continuously improved, especially as the majority of women have participated in social labor, and they urgently demand the socialization of housework such as cooking, washing clothes, and some sewing and mending. In order to adapt to this new situation, our Street Party Committee decided to focus on both production and life, and launched the work of urban life service stations.

    Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, more than 80% of the housewives in XinXing Street, Daowai District, Harbin City, have been in high spirits and enthusiastically walked out of the narrow confines of their families and participated in social labor for the first time. However, after the new situation of "everyone is busy with production, and every household has no idle people" was formed, another aspect emerged. The people who manage housework have less time to manage housework. Who will buy firewood, rice, oil, and salt? Who will clean the room? Who will wash the clothes? Who will take care of the children? How should housework be arranged according to the new situation? If these problems are not solved, the staff must take time after work to take care of housework, which will not only affect normal rest, but also make it difficult to manage well, and may even affect the staff's production attendance and labor efficiency. Therefore, under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, how to organize the people's economic life well is a prominent political task placed in front of our Street Party Committee.

    In order to solve this contradiction in progress, XinXing Street began to run collective welfare undertakings in a big way in early 1959, and built five kindergartens, four nurseries, and five canteens. More than 650 children were entrusted, and more than 800 people ate in the canteens, which solved the difficulties of several hundred female workers in bringing children and cooking. Then, 39 comprehensive service stations and 65 specialized service departments including various service contents were gradually established throughout the street. Now the service stations are systematically organized, led by the residents' committee, with service stations in the residential courtyards and service points in the residential groups, forming a "one-stop" service network. The service content has gradually become comprehensive, diversified, and all-inclusive, from simple to complex. For example, helping residents handle marriage, funeral, and wedding matters, buying goods on behalf of residents, picking up and sending children, cleaning houses, taking care of patients, handling savings on behalf of residents, dismantling, washing, sewing, and mending clothes for residents, repairing furniture, processing clothes, processing food, and so on. At the same time, the service station supplies goods on behalf of state-owned commerce according to the residents' living habits and different needs. For households with special difficulties, such as pregnant women, lying-in women, the elderly, the weak, or people with disabilities, methods such as delivering goods to their doors are adopted to meet their needs.

    After a year of practice, the service station has shown great superiority in comprehensively organizing the people's economic life. It proves that comprehensively organizing the people's economic life is not only economic work, but also political work.

    First of all, the emergence of service stations saves the most precious wealth in the world—manpower and time, so that society has more manpower and time to engage in production labor. XinXing Street has 7,300 households. In the past, each household had to have someone in charge of housework, and I don't know how much manpower and time was consumed in trivial matters such as buying rice and oil. Now, more than 400 service personnel of the comprehensive service station undertake the main part of the housework that used to occupy thousands of people in each household. The service station in XinXing Street also organizes women who cannot completely get rid of housework. Some participate in the work of the service station, some work half a day in the street factory, and some take work from the service station and take it home to do. These women can take care of housework while using their spare time to serve the society. This kind of concentrating the manpower and time scattered and wasted in each household's housework, and letting the service station handle housework, plays a role in promoting the leap forward in production.

    The full-time service personnel of the service station actively think of ways and offer suggestions to manage the housework of each household better than before, so that people have more energy and devote themselves to production labor. In the past, when female worker He Shuzhen went to work, she was always worried that there were still housework matters that had not been taken care of, and her work energy was not concentrated enough; she could not attend work meetings on time; and sometimes she had to ask for leave or be late due to housework. After the service personnel took care of her housework, she worked without any worries, and her efficiency was greatly improved compared to before, and she never absented or was late again. Comrade Ouyang Qin, First Secretary of the CPC Heilongjiang Provincial Committee, said when meeting with representatives of the provincial service personnel conference: "Let people feel convenient everywhere, let people live comfortably and happily, can improve productivity and promote the development of production." The service station has already shown this important role.

    The life service station undertakes the housework of dozens of households and forms a warm big family, so that people feel mutual care and consideration everywhere, thereby promoting changes in people's spiritual outlook and greatly promoting the communist moral customs. Sun Qinghua, a resident of the 10th Residents' Committee, suddenly fell ill one day and vomited and diarrhea when he returned home. The service station immediately sent someone to take care of him. When his lover, Zou Guilan, returned home from work, the patient had already eaten the noodle soup made by the service personnel and was sleeping peacefully; the dirty things that the patient vomited in the house were also cleaned up. Resident Chang, an old lady from the 13th Residents' Committee, has no relatives or children. The service personnel serve the old lady every day like a daughter. The old lady said with emotion: "You are even better than my own daughter!" These touching deeds form a sharp contrast with the old society's "everyone sweeps the snow in front of their own door, and does not care about the frost on other people's roofs."

    The establishment of service stations reflects the Party and the People's Government's meticulous care for the people's lives. The fact is just as the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out: "The greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more the Party should care about the lives of the masses. The more the Party cares about the lives of the masses, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses will be." We are determined to follow the Party's wise instructions and continue to work hard to run the service stations better.

    继续努力把服务站办得更好
    中共哈尔滨市新兴街委员会副书记  任绍昌
    早在二十多年前，毛主席在“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”一文中就教导我们：“解决群众的穿衣问题，吃饭问题，住房问题，柴米油盐问题，疾病卫生问题，婚姻问题。总之，一切群众的实际生活问题，都是我们应当注意的问题。假如我们对这些问题注意了，解决了，满足了群众的需要，我们就真正成了群众生活的组织者，群众就会真正围绕在我们的周围，热烈地拥护我们。”这个指示，对于我们今天党的工作者来说，仍然具有重大的意义。由于生产的发展，城市人民的生活水平不断提高，特别是广大妇女们参加了社会劳动，对原来做饭、洗衣和一些缝缝补补的家务劳动，迫切地要求社会化。为适应这一新的形势，我们街道党委会决定一手抓生产，一手抓生活，开展了城市生活服务站的工作。
    哈尔滨市道外区新兴街，从1958年大跃进以来，80％以上的家庭妇女，心情奋发、兴高采烈地走出了家庭的狭小天地，第一次参加了社会劳动。可是，在“人人忙生产，户户无闲人”的新局面形成以后，又出现了另一方面的情况。管理家务的人管理家务的时间少了，柴米油盐谁去买，房间谁打扫，衣服谁洗，孩子谁带，家务活怎么根据新情况来安排。不解决这些问题，职工就必须在下班后抽出时间来料理家务，这样既影响正常的休息，也不容易料理的好，甚至会影响职工的生产出勤和劳动效率。因此，在大跃进的形势下，怎样组织好人民的经济生活，是摆在我们街道党委面前一项突出的政治任务。
    为了解决这种前进中的矛盾，1959年初新兴街开始大办集体福利事业，兴建了五个幼儿园、四个托儿所、五处食堂。受托的孩子六百五十多名，在食堂就餐的有八百多人，这就解决了几百户女职工带孩子和做饭的困难。接着又在全街逐步建立起包括多种服务内容的综合服务站三十九处，专业服务部六十五处。现在又把服务站系统地组织起来，由居民委员会领导，在居民大院里设服务站，居民组里设服务点，形成“一条龙”的服务网。服务内容从简到繁，逐步做到全面化、多样化、应有尽有。例如，帮助居民办理婚、丧、嫁、娶事宜，代买物品，接送儿童，清扫房屋，照看病人，代办储蓄，为居民拆洗缝补衣裳，修理家具，加工衣服，加工食品，等等。服务站同时根据居民的生活习惯，不同的需要，代国营商业供应商品。对有特别困难的住户，例如孕妇、产妇、老、弱或有残疾的人，采取送货上门的方法，满足需要。
    经过一年的实践，服务站在全面组织人民经济生活上，表现出极大的优越性。证明全面组织人民经济生活，不仅是经济工作，而且是政治工作。
    首先是服务站的出现，节省了世界上最贵重的财富——人力和时间，使社会有更多的人力和时间，从事生产劳动。新兴街有七千三百户居民，过去各家都要有人主持家务，每天不知要有多少人力和时间，消耗在买米买油的生活琐事上。现在综合服务站的四百多名服务员，就担当了过去一家一户时占用几千人的家务劳动的主要部分。新兴街的服务站还把不能完全脱离家务的妇女组织起来，有的参加了服务站的工作，有的在街道工厂半日劳动，有的从服务站领活带回家里去做。这些妇女可以一边照顾家务，一边利用空闲时间为社会服务。这种把分散耗费在各家的家务劳动的人力和时间集中起来，由服务站办理家务，对生产跃进起着促进作用。
    服务站的专职服务员们，积极想办法，出主意，把每一户的家务管理得比原来更好，从而使人们干劲更足，精力充沛地进行生产劳动。女职工赫淑珍过去上班时总是惦念着还有家务事没有办妥，工作精力不够集中；工作会议也不能按时参加；有的时候还要因家务请假或迟到。服务员替她管理了家务以后，她无牵无挂地工作，效率比以前大大提高，再也不缺勤或迟到了。中共黑龙江省委第一书记欧阳钦同志在接见全省服务人员代表会代表时说：“让人们处处感到方便，让人们生活的舒适愉快，就可以提高生产力，促进生产的发展。”服务站已经显示出这种重大作用。
    生活服务站把几十户人家的家务劳动承担起来，组成了一个温暖的大家庭，使人们处处感到相互关怀和体贴照顾，从而促进了人们精神面貌的变化，大大发扬了共产主义的道德风尚。第十居民委员会居民孙庆华，有一天得了急病回到家里，连吐带泻，服务站立即派人来照顾他。等他的爱人邹桂兰下班回家的时候，病人已经吃过服务员做的面汤安静地睡着了；屋子里病人吐的脏东西也打扫的干干净净。第十三居民委员会的居民常老大娘无亲无故，服务员每天像女儿那样侍候老太太。老太太感动地说：“你们真比我的亲闺女还好！”这些感动人的事迹和旧社会“各人自扫门前雪，莫管他人瓦上霜”形成了鲜明的对比。
    服务站的建立，体现了党和人民政府对群众生活无微不至的关怀。事实也正如党的八届六中全会所通过的“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”所指出的：“群众的干劲越大，党越要关心群众生活。党越是关心群众生活，群众的干劲也会越大。”我们决心遵循党的英明指示，继续努力把服务站办得更好。
