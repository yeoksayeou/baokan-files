	Cultivating Successors
	Jing Yu
	A gentle breeze blows, and the earth returns to spring. Looking around, the land of technological innovation in our motherland has added many splendid flowers. Some of these flowers come from the diligent cultivation of veteran workers and technicians, while others are produced by excellent apprentices.
	Look, Zhang Xingyun of the Xi'an Yellow River Machine Factory, a sixteen-year-old girl, has been in the factory for just over a year. However, in that year, she did the equivalent of more than four years' work, and successively realized twenty-three important technological innovation projects. She achieved zero waste products, zero accidents, and zero absenteeism throughout the year. Now she is speeding on a new journey.
	In the high-speed advance of socialist construction, the potential contained within apprentices is truly immeasurable. The apprentices who entered the factory in the autumn of 1958, on average, were about seventeen or eighteen years old in terms of age; in terms of education, the highest level was only junior high school; in terms of work experience, only a little over a year. However, in this year or so, many young apprentices, under the education of the Party, in addition to learning basic operating techniques, have also galloped along the road of technological innovation, leaving time far behind. How heroic and touching this is!
	Do they have special intelligence and special talent? Why do they run so fast and learn so well? Genius comes from diligence. When Zhang Xingyun first started learning technology, she also complained that she was too stupid. Through diligent study and hard practice, she gradually became smarter. Of course, each person's innate aptitude will not be exactly the same, and the effect of learning will also vary; however, this difference can be completely filled and made up for through subjective effort and hard work. Therefore, aptitude is not the decisive factor; the decisive factor lies in subjective effort, diligent study, and hard practice. Each apprentice should make a serious summary of their learning situation over the past year, and they will naturally draw many experiences and lessons.
	Rapidly improving the technical level of apprentices and fully tapping the potential strength of apprentices is related not only to the rapid increase in the labor productivity of enterprises, but also to the rapid development of socialist construction. Now, Guizhou, Xi'an, Wuhan and other places have established apprentice pacesetters, and the competition to catch up with the pacesetters is in full swing. If millions of apprentices on the national industrial front can all make the outstanding achievements of the pacesetters, our construction picture will be even more moving!
	Of course, the improvement of technical level also depends on the improvement of political and ideological level and scientific and technological knowledge. Apprentices are the new blood of the working class. Organizationally speaking, they are already members of the working class, but from a political and ideological point of view, some people still lack the temperament of the working class. Therefore, only by rapidly raising the awareness of the working class in political ideology and firmly establishing the communist world view of the working class, correcting the attitude towards labor, striving to delve into scientific and technological knowledge, and conscientiously learning from the rich experience of veteran masters, is it possible to make rapid progress in technology.
	The broad masses of young apprentices! The 1960s are an era of continuous leaps forward, an era of technological revolution and technological innovation. The times require you to catch up at a rapid pace, set lofty goals, establish great ambitions, and temper yourselves into a working-class fighter with socialist consciousness and a certain amount of cultural, scientific and technological knowledge. Strive! The advanced pacesetters are beckoning to you!

    培养接班人
    静宇
    和风骀荡，大地回春。放眼望去，祖国的技术革新的土地上又添上了许多灿烂的花朵。这些花朵，有的来自老工人和技术人员的辛勤培植，有的则出之于优秀徒工之手。
    看，西安黄河机器厂的张兴云，一个十六岁的小姑娘，进厂不过一年多，然而，她在一年当中，干了相当于四年多的活，先后实现了重要的技术革新项目二十三个。做到了全年无废品、无事故、无缺勤。现在她又在新的里程上飞奔了。
    社会主义建设事业高速度前进中，徒工里面蕴藏着多大的潜力，实在难以计算。1958年秋季进厂的徒工，论年龄，平均大约十七、八岁；论文化，最高不过初中程度；论工龄，仅仅一年多。然而，在这一年多的时间，有不少的青年徒工，在党的教养下，除了学会基本的操作技术以外，又沿着技术革新的道路跃马飞奔，把时间远远抛在后面，这是多么豪迈，多么感人！
    是不是他们有特殊的智慧和特殊的天才？为什么他们跑得那末快，学得那末好？天才出于勤奋。张兴云初学技术的时候，也曾埋怨自己太笨，经过勤学苦练，她就渐渐地聪明起来了。当然，各人的天赋资质不会完全相同，学习的效果也会有所差异；但是，这种差异，经过主观努力，下苦工夫，是完全可以填平补齐的。所以，资质不是决定的因素，决定的因素在于主观努力，勤学苦练。每个徒工，对于一年来的学习情况认真作一次总结，自然会得出不少的经验教训。
    迅速提高徒工的技术水平，充分挖掘徒工中的潜在力量，既关系到企业劳动生产率的迅速提高，也关系到社会主义建设事业的迅速发展。现在，贵州、西安、武汉等地都树立了徒工标兵，赶标兵的竞赛正在热火朝天地开展。全国工业战线上几百万徒工，如果人人都能作出标兵的优异成绩，我们的建设图景那就会更加动人！
    当然，技术水平的提高还决定于政治思想水平和科学技术知识的提高。徒工是工人阶级的新血液，从组织上说，他们已经是工人阶级的成员了，然而从政治思想上来考查，有些人还缺乏工人阶级的气质。因此，只有在政治思想上很快地提高工人阶级的觉悟和巩固地树立工人阶级的共产主义的世界观，端正劳动态度，努力钻研科学技术知识和认真学习老师傅的丰富经验，才有可能在技术上突飞猛进。
    广大的青年徒工们！六十年代是连续跃进的年代，是技术革命和技术革新的年代，时代要求你们一日千里地赶上去，立大志，树雄心，把自己锻炼成为一个有社会主义觉悟和一定文化科学技术知识的工人阶级战士。努力吧！先进的标兵在向你们招手！
