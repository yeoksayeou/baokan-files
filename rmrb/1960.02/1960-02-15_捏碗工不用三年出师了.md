    Workers in the bowl-making workshop of the Taiyuan Dongguan Ceramics Factory in Shanxi Province have successfully trial-produced a bowl-scraping machine.
  This workshop previously relied on manual operations. Using hand-cranked stone discs to mold bowls was inefficient, and training a worker capable of mastering the bowl-making technique also required three years. Now, with the electric bowl-scraping machine, each machine can produce 2,000 bowl blanks per day, and the forming rate of the bowl blanks has also greatly increased. Ordinary workers only need to receive technical instruction once to work independently.

    捏碗工不用三年出师了
    山西太原东关陶瓷厂捏碗车间的职工们，试制刮碗机成功。
  这个车间过去是手工操作。用手摇石盘捏碗，效率很低，而且培养一个能够掌握捏碗技术的工人，也需要三年时间。现在制成电动刮碗机，每台每天可产碗坯两千个，碗坯的成型率也大大提高。一般的工人只要经过一次技术传授，即可单独工作。
