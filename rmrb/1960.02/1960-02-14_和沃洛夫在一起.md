    Together with Volov
    Wang Hongshun, Engineer, Wuhan Iron and Steel Company Ironmaking Plant
    On the afternoon of July 12, 1958, I had just returned to the office from the construction site when the director of our ironmaking plant asked me to go with him to Hankou Railway Station to welcome Soviet experts. The director told me that the ironmaking plant had invited six Soviet experts to help start up the No. 1 blast furnace. At that time, I thought, how wonderful it would be if the experts included someone from the Kuznetsk Iron and Steel Plant! Because I had interned at that plant in 1956 and felt particularly close to it.
    As the green passenger car from Beijing slowly came to a stop, we excitedly stepped forward to greet the distinguished guests. I suddenly heard a warm and familiar voice calling out to me. Turning around, I saw it was Comrade Volov, my teacher during my internship in Kuznetsk. I rushed forward to shake hands and embrace him, exclaiming with joy, "Comrade Volov, a warm welcome to you..." Seeing Comrade Volov reminded me of when I had first arrived at the Kuznetsk Iron and Steel Plant, the plant director introduced me to Comrade Volov and assigned him to help me with my internship. Engineer Volov had a round face, a pair of smiling blue eyes, and a warm heart. When we first met, he kept saying to me, "Whatever help you need from us, we will do our best. We will introduce all our experience to you so that you can build a new China well when you return." When I first arrived in the Soviet Union, my Russian was very poor, and my listening comprehension was also very weak, making learning difficult in the early stages. Many times, he would explain a problem to me, repeating it countless times, and often writing it out in Russian. If I still couldn't understand it, he would draw diagrams to illustrate it until I fully understood.
    After Volov came to Wuhan Iron and Steel, we often went together to inspect the progress and quality of the project, often climbing to the top of the furnace, more than seventy meters high, and crawling into the unbearably hot hot blast stove. August in Wuhan is scorching hot. Fearing that the experts would be too tired, we hoped that he would not go to the construction site too often. But he said with a smile, "I came to China to help with construction, not to be a guest."
    On September 13, the first automated giant blast furnace in New China was completed and put into production ahead of schedule. Volov was pleased with our rapid construction. To ensure the smooth start-up of this giant modern blast furnace, he spent sleepless nights with us during the start-up, only going to rest after personally witnessing the first batch of molten iron flowing out smoothly.
    In early November, in order to increase production, the blast furnace was switched to high-pressure operation. The day after switching to high pressure, an accident occurred due to changes in raw materials - slag overflowed from the No. 4 tuyere. Volov and I rushed over to see that slag was flowing out of the tuyere, burning the tuyere sight glass cover. The slag and fire sprayed out like a ferocious fire dragon. In this tense situation, Comrade Volov immediately proposed switching the blast furnace from high pressure to normal pressure operation and organized pipe fitters to spray water for cooling. Comrade Volov and we worked together to spray water with water pipes, disregarding our safety. I knew that the situation was very urgent and there was a risk of being burned, so I immediately dissuaded him and asked him to leave the scene quickly. But he immediately retorted, "Don't worry about me, production is important..." In this extremely dangerous situation, in order to eliminate the accident, Volov and we fought bravely to rescue the situation, finally solidifying the molten slag, extinguishing the flames, and quickly handling the accident.
    Now, our No. 1 blast furnace is operating normally, and the situation is getting better every day. Whenever I think of the days I spent with expert Volov, and the help he gave us, I cannot restrain my inner excitement. His great spirit of internationalism is so worthy of our learning!

    和沃洛夫在一起
    武汉钢铁公司炼铁厂工程师　王洪顺
    1958年7月12日下午，我刚刚从施工现场回到办公室，我们炼铁厂的厂长就叫我同他一起到汉口车站去欢迎苏联专家。厂长告诉我，这次炼铁厂一共请了六名苏联专家来帮助一号高炉开炉。当时我想，如果专家中有从库兹?斯克钢铁厂来的该多么好啊！因为1956年我曾在那个厂实习过，对它感到特别亲切。
    当从北京开来的绿色客车徐徐停下来时，我们兴奋地走上前去迎接贵宾。我忽然听见一个亲切而熟悉的声音在招呼我。回头一看，原来是沃洛夫同志，我在库兹?斯克实习时的老师。我跑上前去同他握手、拥抱，喜出望外地叫道：“沃洛夫同志，热烈地欢迎您……”看见沃洛夫同志，使我回忆起了刚到库兹?斯克钢铁厂，厂长把我介绍给沃洛夫同志，并指派他帮助我实习时的情景。沃洛夫工程师有一张圆圆的面孔、一双笑迷迷的蓝眼睛和一颗热忱的心。当我们第一次见面时，他不停地对我说：“需要我们那些帮助，我们一定尽力。我们一定就把所有的经验都介绍给你们，使你们回去后能很好地建设新中国。”刚到苏联时，由于我的俄语很不熟练，而且听力很差，学习初期很吃力。有许多次，他给我讲一个问题，不知要讲多少遍，还常常用俄文写。如果写出还看不懂，他就画图来说明，直到使我完全了解为止。
    沃洛夫来到武钢后，我们经常一道去检查工程进度与工程质量，常常爬到七十几米的炉顶，钻进使人难以忍耐的热风炉。武汉的8月份是酷热的，怕专家太辛苦了，我们希望他不要经常到施工现场去。可是他笑着说：“我到中国来是帮助建设的，不是来作客的。”
    9月13日，新中国第一座自动化的巨型高炉，比原计划提前建成投入生产了。沃洛夫为我们的快速建设而高兴。为了使这座巨型的现代化高炉开炉顺利，在开炉时，他同我们一起度过了不眠之夜，直到亲眼看到第一炉铁水顺利流出后，才去休息。
    11月初，为了提高产量，高炉转为高压操作。转高压后的第二天，由于原料变动，发生了事故——四号风口涌渣。我和沃洛夫一起跑去一看，炉渣由风口往外流，把风口视孔盖烧坏，渣和火往外喷射得像一条凶恶的火龙。沃洛夫同志在这种紧张情况下，立即提出把高炉由高压转为常压操作，并组织配管工喷水冷却。沃洛夫同志和我们一起奋不顾身地用水管浇水。我知道这种情况很紧急，有被烧伤的危险，当即劝阻他，要他迅速离开现场。但他马上反驳我说：“不要照顾我，生产重要……”在这种极端危险的情况下，为了消除这个事故，沃洛夫和我们一道奋勇抢救，终于使熔渣凝固，火焰熄灭，迅速处理了这次事故。
    现在，我们的一号高炉正常地生产着，情况一天更比一天好。每当想起了同沃洛夫专家相处的日子，想起他给我们的帮助时，我就抑制不住内心的激动。他那种伟大的国际主义精神，多么值得我们学习啊！
