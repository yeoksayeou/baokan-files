Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin – Hebei Province's first newly built modern medium-sized steel rolling workshop – the Tanggang Medium Rolling Workshop – has recently been officially put into production. It can produce various medium-sized steel products such as steel rails, I-beams, round steel, square steel, and angle steel, changing the situation in Hebei where only small-sized steel products could be produced in the past.

This large-scale, fully modernized medium-sized steel rolling workshop was built in just seventy-five days, three and a half months ahead of the time required by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and the project quality is excellent. Its ability to be built at high speed and with high quality is the result of the builders carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution under the leadership of the construction site Party committee. During the construction process, they put forward more than 1,000 innovation suggestions aimed at key problems in the construction, generally improving work efficiency by about one time, and some improving work efficiency by several to dozens of times, greatly accelerating the construction progress.

The high-speed completion of this workshop is also the result of the relevant parties giving play to the spirit of communist cooperation. More than a dozen construction and capital construction units from various places formed a whole. Under the unified leadership of the construction site Party committee, they concentrated their superior forces and made key breakthroughs, ensuring the high-speed completion of key projects. Two hundred and sixteen enterprises in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Dalian, and other places also rushed to manufacture various equipment and accessories in a timely manner, delivering them one to two months ahead of schedule. Iron and steel companies in Anshan, Baotou, Shanghai, Chongqing, Taiyuan, and other places also sent excellent technicians and engineers to help this workshop solve many production problems and train a large number of technical personnel.

    河北七十五天建成中型轧钢车间
    据新华社天津电　河北省新建的第一座现代化中型轧钢车间——唐钢中轧车间已在最近正式投入生产。它能生产钢轨、工字钢、圆钢、方钢、角钢等各种中型钢材，改变了河北过去只能生产小型钢材的状况。
    这座规模很大、设备完全现代化的中型轧钢车间，全部建设时间只用了七十五天，比冶金工业部要求的时间提前了三个半月，而且工程质量优良。它能高速优质建成，是建设者们在工地党委领导下大闹技术革新和技术革命的结果。他们在施工过程中，针对建设中的关键问题，提出了一千多条革新建议，普遍提高工作效率一倍左右，有的提高工效几倍到几十倍，大大加速了施工进度。
    这个车间的高速度建成，也是各有关方面发挥了共产主义协作精神的结果。来自各地的十多个施工单位和基建单位组成一个整体，在工地党委的统一领导下，集中优势力量，重点突击，保证了重点工程高速度建成。北京、天津、上海、大连等地二百十六个企业，也及时地赶制了各种设备和配件，提前一个月到两个月交货；鞍山、包头、上海、重庆、太原等地钢铁公司，还派来了优秀的技术工人和工程师，帮助这个车间解决了许多生产问题和培养了大批技术力量。
