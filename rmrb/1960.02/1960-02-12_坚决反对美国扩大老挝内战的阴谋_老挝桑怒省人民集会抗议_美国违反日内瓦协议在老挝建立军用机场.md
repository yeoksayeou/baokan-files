Laotian People in Sam Neua Province Rally to Protest
The United States Violates the Geneva Accords by Building Military Airports in Laos

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 10th: According to "Laotian Patriotic News," people from various districts in Sam Neua Province, Laos, held rallies in January to express their firm opposition to the conspiracy of US imperialism and the heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" of Laos to expand the Laotian civil war and turn Laos into a military base and colony of US imperialism.

According to reports, the people of various districts in Sam Neua Province sent eleven petitions, signed by 1,693 people, to the King of Laos, ten petitions, signed by 2,496 people, to the Speaker of the National Assembly, and sixteen petitions, signed by 1,543 people, to the Royal Government. These petitions expressed firm opposition to the Royal Government's army carrying out "sweeps," persecuting and arresting people, and forcing people to live in concentrated settlements. The petitions demanded that the Royal Government restore the freedom of the leaders of the Lao Fighting Units so that they could participate in the upcoming general election; immediately stop the civil war, restore normalcy, and hold negotiations with the Lao Patriotic Front to make Laos a truly peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, unified, and prosperous country.

The people of Sam Neua Province also wrote many letters to the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, expressing their utmost confidence in its wise leadership, guaranteeing to strengthen unity, carry out struggles, and vigorously develop production.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 9th: According to a broadcast from Vientiane Radio, the largest airport in Laos, the Muong Khong Airport, built with American "aid" and capable of handling heavy aircraft, was inaugurated on February 6th. The construction of this airport, located in the province of Bassac, is believed to be for US military purposes in the region and is therefore a violation of the Geneva Accords.

Lieutenant General Soonthorn Pathammavong, Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Lao Armed Forces, Brigadier General Van Rathikoun, Chief of Staff, Noui Abhay, Deputy Prime Minister of Laos, and US Ambassador Smith attended the inauguration ceremony of the airport.
