New People on the Grassland Outnumber the Stars

Building a Road on a Cliff

Longzhibu, a member of the Communist Youth League, is a herdsman in the Kaligang Production Team of the Bagou Commune in Tongde County. He spends his days herding sheep, going out early and returning late.

On the northwest bank of the Yellow River stands a towering cliff, and on top of the cliff lies the lush Xiangmuqi meadow. For years, this good grassland had not been utilized. Longzhibu thought: If a road could be built along the river, how great would it be to let the sheep graze on Xiangmuqi meadow and fatten up! Longzhibu's idea quickly gained the support of the commune Party committee, and they sent three people to help him. The road construction began. Longzhibu worked on the treacherous cliff, while the Yellow River roared below. The space at the bottom of the cliff could only accommodate one person. Longzhibu tightly tied a rope more than ten yards long around his waist, and with others holding the rope, he slid down to the bottom of the cliff. He first used an iron pickaxe to build a section of road along the Yellow River. Then, he continued to build up the cliff, where there was no place to stand. He used a hoe to dig a foothold, stabilized himself, and continued to break rocks. After three days of struggle, a six-foot-wide, twenty-seven-yard-long road appeared before Longzhibu, winding its way to Xiangmuqi meadow.

After the road was built, Longzhibu's flock of sheep often grazed on the fresh grass of Xiangmuqi meadow, and they quickly gained top-quality膘 [biāo] (fatness). Now, it has also become a pasture for other herdsmen in the commune. Longzhibu's one hundred and fifteen goats produced one hundred and fifteen kids, with one hundred and twelve surviving, achieving high yields.

Skillfully Treating a Cow Fracture

One day, Ye Shi-jia, a herdsman from the Red Flag Ranch in Gande County, was driving his herd back from Langke Gully when a cow's right hind leg stepped into a hollow, its body twisted, and its leg broke, rendering it unable to move. Ye Shi-jia was very worried. He thought: When people's hands and feet are fractured, doctors can apply splints. Could the same method be used for a cow's fracture? He immediately tore off some whip hemp by the gully and tied it to the cow's leg, then helped the cow slowly walk back to the pen. After returning home, he shaved wood into thin slices, padded them with felt, and carefully wrapped the broken cow's leg. After seven days, he began to lead the cow to walk slowly; after twenty-one days, Ye Shi-jia unwrapped the wooden boards and felt and saw that the cow's leg bone had completely healed. Before liberation, Ye Shi-jia was a slave exploited and oppressed by the herdowner class. Since becoming a herdsman at the ranch, he has been very careful in protecting the cattle, sheep, and ranch property. After this cow's leg fracture, he thought that to better care for the cattle and sheep, in addition to careful feeding and management, he must also learn general veterinary techniques. From then on, he studied diligently, often consulting veterinary staff and experienced old herdsmen, and constantly searched for various herbs while herding. Now, he has acquired certain veterinary knowledge and can treat common livestock injuries and illnesses.

Battle in the Muddy Swamp

One afternoon, Zhang Guangchen and Ma Yingxiang, police officers from Dari County, were returning from hunting in the Sangrima area when they discovered a group of yaks and horses struggling in a muddy swamp. They immediately ran to rescue them. There were fourteen cattle and two horses in total. Some of the yaks had all four legs stuck in the mud. Several Tibetan women were anxiously wiping away tears on the side. They unhesitatingly took off their cotton coats and shoes and jumped into the mud pit. The mud was waist-deep, and it was difficult to even stand still. How could they rescue these clumsy livestock! They saw many stones on the opposite hillside and immediately ran up to transport the stones. It was difficult to walk in the muddy pit even empty-handed, let alone carrying heavy stones. They fell down, got up; fell down again, got up again. Finally, they padded a stone road next to the cattle and horses. But the cattle and horses still couldn't climb up on their own. They pushed the cattle down, pulled out their legs, first lifted them onto the stones, and then carried them along the stone road. They carried one head after another, making sixteen trips back and forth. At this time, their faces and lips were frozen purple, and their whole bodies were numb. When the Tibetan women repeatedly thanked them, they said, "We were just doing what a police officer should do." (Attached picture)

    草原新人比星多
    在悬崖上修路
    共青团员龙智布，是同德县巴沟公社卡力岗生产队的放牧员。他天天跟群放牧，早出晚归。
    黄河西北岸矗立着悬崖绝壁，悬崖上有一片水草丰美的香木其滩。多少年来，这个好草滩没有被人利用过。龙智布想：如果能在河边修一条路，让羊群到香木其滩去抓膘该多好啊！龙智布的想法很快得到公社党委的支持，并且派了三个人去帮助他。修路工作开始了。龙智布在险恶的悬崖绝壁上工作，黄河在下面怒吼。悬崖底下只能容一个人，龙智布的腰里紧紧系了一根十多丈长的绳子，让别人拉着，他溜到悬崖下面，先用铁铣在黄河边上修了一段路。再往悬崖上修，连落脚的地方也没有了。他就用镢头挖一个立脚点，站稳了脚再继续开山劈石。经过三天的斗争，龙智布面前出现了一条六尺宽，二十七丈长的道路，弯弯曲曲地通向香木其滩。
    道路修好后，龙智布放牧的羊群常常到香木其滩吃鲜美的青草，这群羊很快全部抓上了一类膘。现在，这里也成了公社其他放牧员的草场。龙智布放牧的一百一十五只山羊，产羔一百一十五只，成活一百一十二只，获得了高额丰产。
    巧治牛骨折
    有一天，甘德县红旗牧场放牧员叶什加赶着牛群从郎客沟回来，一头牛的右后腿踩到了一个哈拉洞里，身子一歪，腿便折断了，再也不能动弹。叶什加十分着急，他想：人的手脚骨折了，医生可以上夹板，牛骨折了是不是也可以用这办法试试呢？他马上在沟边扯了一把鞭麻绑在牛腿上，再扶着牛慢慢走回牛圈。回家后，他把木板削成薄片，在上面垫一些毛毡，然后将折断的牛腿好好包扎起来。七天过后，他开始牵着牛慢慢走动；二十一天以后，叶什加解开木板和毡片一看，牛腿骨已经完全长好了。解放前，叶什加是一个受牧主阶级剥削压迫的奴隶，自从到牧场当了牧工以后，对牛羊和牧场财产都十分爱护。遇到这次牛折骨的事故后，他想，要更好地照顾牛羊，除了要小心饲养管理外，还必须学会一般的兽医技术。从此，他就苦心钻研，经常向兽医员和有经验的老放牧员请教，放牧中时时注意搜寻各种草药。现在，他已经具备了一定的兽医知识，能治疗牲口的一般伤病了。
    烂泥滩里的战斗
    一天下午，达日县民警张广臣和马英祥从桑日麻地区打猎回来，发现一群牦牛和马吃力地挣扎在烂泥滩里，就马上跑去抢救。这里共有十四头牛和两匹马。有的牦牛四条腿全陷在污泥里。几个藏族妇女急得在一旁揩眼泪。他俩毫不犹豫地脱掉棉袄和鞋子，跳进泥坑里。泥齐腰深，站都站不稳，怎样救出这些笨重的牲畜呢！他们看到对面山坡上有很多石头，就立即跑上去运石头。烂泥坑里空手都不好走，抬上重石头更困难。他们跌倒了，爬起来；再跌倒，再爬起来。终于在牛马旁边垫成了一条石块路。但是牛马自己仍旧爬不上来。他们就把牛推倒，拔出牛腿，先抬到石头上，再沿着石头路往外抬，抬完一头再一头，就这样来往抬了十六趟。这时，他们的脸、唇都冻得发紫，全身也麻木了。当藏族妇女一再地感谢他们时，他们说：“我们不过是做了一个民警应该做的事情”。（附图片）
