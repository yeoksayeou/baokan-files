    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, Feb. 24th: The Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Commission, holding a meeting in Moscow, has been in session for twenty-two days as of the 23rd. The meeting has now concluded discussions on the fish resources of salmon in the treaty-defined area (Northwest Pacific), and from the 23rd began to specifically study the fish resources of various fish in this area. In the future, the Soviet and Japanese delegations will, based on the fish resources, determine the salmon catch quotas for both sides in 1960.
    From the written statements exchanged between the Soviet and Japanese delegations, it can be seen that the current situation of Far Eastern salmon resources is extremely unsatisfactory. The Soviet side pointed out in its statement that the reason for the sharp decline in fish resources is the result of open and large-scale illegal catches by Japanese fishing operators. According to a report by Japan's Kyodo News, Japanese fishing operators, disregarding the fishing limits stipulated in the treaty, exceeded the limit by 63,000 tons in this area in 1957; exceeded the limit by 72,000 tons in 1958; and exceeded the limit by 85,000 tons in 1959.
    The Soviet delegation suggested that the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Commission should immediately take measures to restore the salmon resources in the Northwest Pacific region as quickly as possible, strictly abide by the various provisions of the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement, and instruct both parties to protect, breed, and rationally utilize the rich resources of salmon and other aquatic animals in this area.

    苏日渔业委员会举行会议
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏日渔业委员会在莫斯科举行会议，到23日已经进行了二十二天。现在，会议已经结束了对条约规定地区（太平洋西北部）鲑鱼的鱼源情况的讨论，从23日起开始具体研究这一地区各种鱼的鱼源情况。将来，苏日两国代表团将根据鱼源的情况，确定1960年双方鲑鱼的捕捉定额。
    从苏日两国代表团所交换的书面声明中可以看出，目前远东鲑鱼的鱼源的情况极其不能令人满意。苏联方面在声明中指出，鱼源之所以急剧减少，是由于日本渔业主公开大肆非法捕捉的结果。据日本共同社报道，日本渔业主不顾条约规定的捕鱼限额，于1957年在这一地区超过限额捕鱼六万三千吨；1958年超额捕鱼七万二千吨；1959年又超额捕鱼八万五千吨。
    苏联代表团建议，苏日渔业委员会应立即采取能够尽速恢复太平洋西北部地区鲑鱼的鱼源的措施，并严格遵守苏日渔业协定的各项条款，责成双方保护、繁殖并合理利用这一地区的鲑鱼和其他水产动物的富源。
