    Anhui Province, from Huaibei to Jiangnan, from mountainous areas to plains, is showing a scene of busy spring planting preparations. Of the province's more than 16 million mu of spring land, nearly 10 million mu have undergone spring plowing and harrowing; more than 5 million mu have been fertilized; more than 167,000 sweet potato hotbeds have been prepared, with more than 110 million jin of seeds sown, and more than 150,000 mu of spring crops such as spring buckwheat and hemp have been sown. The progress is fast, and the quality is high, surpassing any previous year. Since last winter, the province has mobilized 2 million people daily to seize fertilizer, accumulating 35 billion dan of various fertilizers. In addition to topdressing for summer harvest crops, 60% of the base fertilizer for spring-sown crops has been accumulated. Rice seedling fields have been generally selected in counties along the Yangtze River, and fertilization has begun. Chaoxian County has selected more than 4,000 mu of rice seedling fields, of which more than 1,000 mu have been fertilized with base fertilizer.

    At present, all parts of the province are organizing forces to carry out large-scale inspections and evaluations, and to deeply develop competitive activities to ensure the completion of spring sowing tasks on time, with good quality, and in sufficient quantity.
