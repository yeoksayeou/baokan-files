Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 6th. Wudu County, Gansu Province, is vigorously attacking the wheat regreening stage, with field management focused on irrigation, fertilization, weeding, and pest and disease control reaching a climax. Currently, all 420,000 mu of winter wheat in the county are generally growing well. Wheat that has regreened on both banks of the Bailong River and the Rhino River has already grown to three inches high.

In order to seize a bumper harvest this year, the people's communes are focusing on field management of winter wheat. Various localities have adopted the method of "secretary taking the lead, responsibility assigned at each level, combining professional teams and mass mobilization," mobilizing more than 40,000 people to ensure that the wheat fields are irrigated when dry, fertilized when lacking, and weeded when there's grass. Bailong People's Commune has successively held seven on-site evaluation meetings in production teams such as Dongjiang and Chengguan, deepening the wheat field management work step by step. More than 9,000 mu of wheat in the entire commune has generally been fertilized one to three times with regreening fertilizer; more than 5,000 mu have been winter-irrigated, most of which have been irrigated more than twice; and more than 1,800 mu have been weeded one to two times. In the winter irrigation, Chengguan Brigade of this commune adopted the method of "people responsible for channels, channels responsible for mu, repairing channels, and collecting ice and snow" and "fixed time, fixed tasks, fixed quality," achieving economical water use and fast and good winter irrigation work. All of the brigade's more than 1,200 mu of wheat have been irrigated two to three times. Within ten days, Toufang People's Commune generally irrigated more than 1,100 mu of wheat twice, fertilized twice, and compacted once. Pingluo People's Commune launched a wheat field management campaign of ordinary fields catching up with high-yield fields, high-yield fields catching up with experimental fields, returned-hoeing fields catching up with whole-hoeing fields, second-class seedlings catching up with first-class seedlings, and weak seedlings catching up with strong seedlings, making the wheat field management work more and more meticulous.

    缺水灌水缺肥施肥有草锄草
    甘肃武都县猛攻小麦返青关
    新华社兰州6日电　甘肃省武都县猛攻小麦返青关，以灌水、施肥、锄草、防治病虫害为中心的麦田管理进入高潮。现在，全县四十二万亩冬小麦，普遍生长良好。白龙江、犀牛江两岸返青后的小麦，已经长到三寸高。
    各人民公社为了夺取今年粮食大丰收，大抓冬小麦的田间管理工作。各地采取“书记挂帅，层层包干，专业队和全民突击相结合”的办法，共出动四万多人，对麦田做到缺水灌水，缺肥施肥，有草锄草。白龙人民公社先后在东江、城关等生产队召开了七次现场评比会，使麦田管理工作步步深入。全社九千多亩小麦已普遍施了一至三次返青肥；冬灌五千多亩，其中绝大部分灌了两遍以上；有一千八百多亩锄草一至二遍。这个公社城关大队在冬灌中采用“人包渠、渠包亩、整理渠道、背冰积雪”和“定时间、定任务、定质量”的办法，作到了经济用水，冬灌工作又快又好。全大队一千二百多亩小麦已经全部灌了二至三遍。透防人民公社在十天内，把一千一百多亩小麦普遍灌了两次水，施了两次肥和镇压了一次。平洛人民公社开展了一般田赶丰产田，丰产田赶试验田，回槎田赶整槎田，二类苗赶一类苗，弱苗赶强苗的麦田管理运动，麦田管理工作越做越细。
