The people of Mengjin County, Henan Province, are doing everything possible to divert water to the Mangshan Mountains in order to win an even greater wheat harvest this year, allowing the land, which has been threatened by drought for thousands of years, to drink its fill of sweet nectar.

Mengjin County is a hilly area with many gullies and low water levels. In the past, drought was common nine years out of ten, and in some places even drinking water was difficult to obtain. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, continuous bumper harvests were achieved through large-scale farmland water conservancy projects and comprehensive mountain management. However, the soil moisture was insufficient when wheat was planted last year, and there has been no soaking rain from last winter to the present, and currently the wheat generally shows yellowing and dry tips, which seriously threatens wheat growth. In order to win a bumper wheat harvest and completely change the low-yielding appearance of the mountains, the Mengjin County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China called on the 260,000 people of the county to quickly join the anti-drought and wheat-watering campaign.

All people's communes in the county paid attention to the rational arrangement of labor. The Shilin Brigade of the Changhua Commune, after fighting for three days, installed a 120-horsepower water pump on a 25-zhang-deep stone cliff, established three pumping stations, and irrigated more than 9,300 mu of wheat. The Pingle Commune adopted the method of drilling holes through mountains, building bridges over gullies, guiding water section by section, and lifting water up the mountains, improving the "Rocket Canal" and diverting the Luo River water to the Mangshan Ridge, irrigating the land on the Mang Ridge that had never been irrigated before.

In addition to the Yellow River Main Canal for self-flowing irrigation, the Chengguan Commune has 830 motorized wells and ordinary wells. It adopts the method of alternating human and animal power and keeping the water wheels running day and night, rotating to pump water for irrigation. More than 5,000 laborers were mobilized, and more than 12,000 mu of land were irrigated in three days. The Hengshui and Matun Communes built 22 water-blocking dams along both banks of the Yi River, blocking all the water in the Yi River.

The "May 8th," "Friendship," "Unity," and "Yu jia Zui" reservoirs of the Hengshui Commune, in addition to one that can be irrigated by gravity flow, the other three were also equipped with water pumps, irrigating more than 1,500 mu of land day and night. More than 40 members of the Niuwang Brigade of the Changhua Commune drilled four water wells in a mountain gully more than five zhang deep in two days, diverting water up the mountain to irrigate the land.

In the anti-drought and wheat-watering campaign, in order to save labor and improve work efficiency, all communes concentrated skilled craftsmen to reform and repair water-lifting tools. The county established 129 professional teams with a total of more than 1,200 people, repairing more than 12,000 pieces of water-lifting tools. In the campaign, the Pingle Commune organized more than 250 iron and wood technicians to repair more than 670 buckets and 120 carts in two days, realizing the cartization. The Zhaiquan Brigade of this commune has more than 20 machines, most of which are powered by gasoline. With the painstaking research of teachers and students of the Red and Expert School, gasoline engines were converted into kerosene engines, irrigating more than 3,000 mu of land in four days.

    孟津县人民引水上山
    千年旱地饱饮玉浆
    本报讯　河南孟津县为了夺取今年小麦更大丰收，想尽一切办法，引水上邙山，使千百年来遭受干旱威胁的土地饱饮玉浆。
    孟津县是个丘陵区，沟壑多，水位低，过去十年九旱，有的地方吃水都很困难。解放后在党的领导下，通过大兴农田水利和综合治理山区，获得了连年丰产。但是，去年种麦时底墒不足，去冬到现在未下过透雨，目前小麦普遍呈现叶黄尖干，严重威胁着小麦生长。中共孟津县委为了夺取小麦大丰收，彻底改变山岭低产面貌，号召全县二十六万人民迅速投入抗旱浇麦运动。
    全县各人民公社都注意合理安排劳力。长华公社柿林大队，奋战了三天，在二十五丈深的石崖上，安装了一百二十马力的抽水机，建立了三个抽水站，灌溉小麦九千三百多亩。平乐公社采取逢山打洞，遇沟架桥，节节导引，提水上山的办法，改善火箭渠，把洛河水引到邙山岭上，灌溉自古以来未浇过的邙岭上的土地。
    城关公社除黄河大渠自流灌溉外，有机井和一般井八百三十眼，采取人畜换班、水车不停的办法，日夜轮流抽水浇灌，全社共出动劳力五千多人，三天浇地一万二千多亩。横水、马屯两个公社，沿?河两岸打了二十二个拦水坝，把?河水全部拦了起来。
    横水公社的“五八”、“友好”、“团结”、“于家嘴”四个水库，除一个能自流灌溉外，其他三个也安上了抽水机，一天一夜浇地一千五百多亩。长华公社牛王大队四十多名社员，在五丈多深的山沟里，两天打透水井四眼，引水上山浇地。
    在抗旱浇麦运动中，为了节省劳力，提高工效，各公社都集中了能工巧匠，改革和检修提水工具，全县建立专业队一百二十九个、共一千二百多人，检修提水工具一万二千多件。平乐公社在运动中，组织铁、木技术工人二百五十多人，两天整修水桶六百七十多个、小车一百二十辆，实现了车子化，这个公社的翟泉大队有二十多部机器，大部都是用汽油发动，在红专学校师生的苦心钻研下，汽油机改成了煤油机，四天中浇地三千多亩。
