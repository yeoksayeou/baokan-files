Chongqing, February 3rd (from our newspaper) – The workers of Chongqing Third Steel Plant, after two years of diligent research, have independently designed, manufactured, and installed China's first medium-sized vertical continuous casting machine.

Xu Baoshen, the original Deputy Director and Chief Engineer of the plant, and related technical personnel, studied and applied the new Soviet technology of continuous casting. They also incorporated new innovations in the equipment's structure and layout, based on the specific conditions of the plant. This equipment officially went into production in early January of this year. Over six hundred and eighty tons of steel billets have been poured in more than one hundred castings. The heavy rails and other steel products rolled from these billets are of good quality.

Continuous casting involves continuously casting molten steel into billets, shortening the complex production process of casting ingots, demolding and cooling, surface finishing, reheating, and rolling into billets into a single process. This greatly speeds up the production process and increases output.

At the same time, the use of continuous casting machines is of great significance for improving the quality of steel billets, increasing steel yield, saving manpower, reducing the labor intensity of ingot casting workers, and saving steel ingot molds and refractory materials used for steel casting. The currently used method of casting ingots with steel ingot molds often results in uneven distribution of chemical composition and inclusions in the steel ingots due to the long cooling time. Continuous casting machines rapidly cool the molten steel, significantly reducing these shortcomings and improving the quality of the steel. The heavy rails, light rails, and tie plates rolled from these continuously cast billets have all met the technical standards for mechanical properties. Continuous casting can increase the steel yield by about 10% compared to the original ingot casting method, due to the reduction of losses from cropping ingot heads.

    重庆第三钢铁厂技术人员发扬集体智慧
    徐宝深等制成连续铸钢机
    本报重庆3日电　重庆第三钢铁厂的职工，经过两年来的刻苦钻研，自己设计、制造和安装了我国第一套中型立式连续铸钢机。
    这个厂的原副厂长兼总工程师徐宝深和有关技术人员，学习和运用了苏联连续铸钢的新技术，结合本厂的具体条件，在设备的结构和布置方面都有新的创造。这套设备，已在今年1月初正式投入生产，从一百多次浇铸的六百八十多吨钢坯看来，这些钢坯轧出的重轨和其他钢材，质量良好。
    连续铸钢即是将钢水连续浇铸成钢坯，使过去钢坯生产过程中的浇铸成锭、脱模冷却、表面精整、重新加热、轧制成坯等繁复的生产过程，缩短成为一道工序。这样就大大加快了生产过程，提高了产量。
    同时，使用连续铸钢机，对提高钢坯质量、增加钢材收得率、节约人力、减轻铸锭工人的劳动强度、以及节约钢锭模、铸钢用的耐火材料等都有很大的意义。目前使用的以钢锭模浇铸钢锭的方法，由于冷却时间长，钢锭中的化学成分和夹杂物往往分布不匀，连续铸钢机使钢水快速冷却，就显著地减少了这些缺点，提高了钢的质量。用这种连续铸坯轧出的重轨、轻轨和垫板等钢材，机械性能也都达到了技术标准；连续铸钢比原铸锭方法，由于减少钢锭切头等损失，因而能使钢材的收得率增加10％左右。
