    Cigarette Butts Exchanged for Comic Books
    Comrade Wang Shukun, a service worker at the Yushutai Hotel in Lishu County, which was named a Red Flag Unit in Jilin Province, is not only diligent in his work and treats guests like family, but also treats the hotel as his home and is very frugal. When cleaning rooms, he always collects the cigarette butts discarded by guests into a prepared box. In this way, he sold the cigarette butts he collected over three months for 7 yuan, 4 jiao and 4 fen, and exchanged them for fifty comic books for the guests.
    The guests who read the new comic books were so moved that they praised in unison: "The Red Flag Hotel is extraordinary, collecting cigarette butts to exchange for books, the guests feel refreshed after reading, praising the Red Flag Hotel in unison."
    Zhang Shuqin, Grain Bureau of Siping Prefecture, Jilin Province

    烟头换了小人书
    被评为吉林省红旗单位的梨树县于树台旅店中的服务员王淑坤同志，不但在工作中勤勤恳恳，待客如亲人，而且以店为家，非常勤俭。他在清扫房间的时候，总是随时把旅客扔掉的烟头集中到准备好的匣子里。就这样，把三个月内搜捡的烟头卖了人民币七元四角四分，给旅客换回五十册小人书。
    看过新小人书的旅客被感动得异口同声地赞扬说：“红旗旅店不一般，搜捡烟头把书换，旅客读后精神爽，齐声赞颂红旗店”。
