    The Experiences of Zoey, a Black Man
    Sima Liang
    One early spring morning in early February, old Zoey Smith, a black man who worked as a doorman at a restaurant in Harlem, New York, got up especially early. He had read in the newspaper that many churches, clubs, schools, and universities were holding exhibitions and lectures for "Black History Week," and he decided to take advantage of his day off to visit them.
    Zoey was in his fifties and hadn't had much schooling. He only knew a few stories about black people from his grandfather when he was a child, and he knew very little about black history. According to the newspaper, the "Black History Week" held by those kind-hearted white people was intended to study and introduce in detail the history of black people in America, the influence of black people on American history, and the achievements of black people in literature, art, science, and economics. Zoey thought this was a good opportunity to broaden his knowledge. He even had the idea that since the white gentlemen were showing such enthusiasm and importance to the history and role of black people, the painful days of discrimination and persecution against black people in America might be coming to an end.
    Old Zoey decided to first go to the municipal library to see the exhibition being held there. He walked out of the crowded and dirty black neighborhood and saw the poplars sprouting on both sides of the road. A gust of spring breeze blew in his face, and he felt that the weather was particularly good today. He bought a copy of the day's "New York Times" at the newsstand on the street corner, and just then a bus stopped at the bus stop on the side of the road, and he quickly stepped on. Perhaps because he was in a particularly cheerful mood today, old Zoey seemed to feel that everyone on the bus was greeting him with a smile. He saw an empty seat and sat down, opened the newspaper. The two large headlines on the front page immediately caught his attention. "Governor Rockefeller Emphasizes: No nation can produce a record of such rapid development and progress as that achieved by black people in America," "Mayor Wagner Says: The history of black people's contributions to New York is of inestimable benefit to all citizens." Zoey took out his reading glasses from his pocket and was about to read the details. A rough voice from the conductor sounded behind him: "Nigger, get to the back!" Zoey then remembered that he had inadvertently sat in the white-only seat. He helplessly stood up and walked to the back of the bus, which was already full of black people. Zoey stood in a corner, staring blankly out the window, as if the sky had suddenly become dark, and the enthusiasm he had when he left the house was greatly reduced.
    When he arrived at the municipal library, he laboriously climbed more than twenty steps, bought an admission ticket, and walked into the gate. At the entrance of a large hall hung a sign saying "American Black History Exhibition." He was about to walk inside when he saw that those visiting inside were all well-dressed white gentlemen and ladies. He thought of the past practice and the shout on the bus just now, and couldn't help but hesitate a little. Were black people allowed to enter? Was there a special exhibition room for black people? He politely asked the gatekeeper, "May I go in?"
    "Well, go in, but don't squeeze against the gentlemen and ladies, don't break anything, don't make the floor dirty, don't..." Old Zoey listened to his instructions with great patience.
    The hall was decorated quite beautifully, and the exhibits were very rich, with charts and objects. After seeing it, Zoey did gain a lot of useful knowledge. For example: their ancestors—more than ten million black people—were trafficked from Africa to the Americas as slaves in the 16th to 18th centuries. These black people were forced to perform heavy labor on farms, producing tobacco, cotton, grain, and other crops. Their labor created America's wealth and prosperity. American black people, after a bloody struggle from 1861 to 1865, achieved the abolition of slavery. Because they suffered from common enslavement and suffering, they formed a traditional black culture, and their poetry, music, folk songs, and customs have made indelible contributions to American art and literature. In every war to defend the United States, black people have bravely sacrificed countless blood and lives. In World War II, there were entire troops composed of black people participating in combat. The American Fifth Army, which fought on the Italian front, almost entirely consisted of the Ninety-second Division of black people. In the American contemporary cultural and academic circles, there is a series of brilliant black names: Paul Robeson, Du Bois, Langston Hughes, Sterling Brown, Owen Dodson, William Grant Still, George Washington Carver... Then on what basis do racists say that black people are an inferior nation? Zoey felt pride as a black man on the one hand, and also felt inexplicable indignation.
    But Zoey found that many facts about the current situation of black people that he knew from the newspapers were not mentioned at all in the exhibition. For example: out of the five million black people of voting age in the southern United States, 3.8 million were deprived of the right to vote. Out of the more than 1.242 million black school-age children in five states including Florida, only more than 3,000 were allowed to enter white schools. Many states have passed racial segregation laws. Many hotels, restaurants, theaters, libraries, and even zoos prohibit black people from entering. One-third of black families belong to the poorest families in the United States. In the southern United States, from 1955 to 1958, there were 530 incidents of murder, assault, explosions, and mob attacks persecuting black people... Zoey thought to himself: Aren't these all living histories of American black people?
    The old black man walked out of the municipal library in a daze. He asked himself: "Since black people have made such great contributions to American history and culture, why are they still being oppressed and discriminated against by white people to this day?" Zoey couldn't help but hum softly an old American black folk song:
    "We plant the wheat,
    They give us the corn;
    They bake the bread well,
    They give us the bread crust;
    We sift rice to cook,
    They tell us to eat bran;
    We skin and cut meat,
    They tell us to eat meat skin;
    That's how they
    Deceive us;
    We skim the cream,
    They give us milk without cream;
    And say that's good enough for black people."
    Zoey then remembered that he had rushed out this morning and had not eaten breakfast yet, and now it was lunchtime. He walked to a nearby restaurant, wanting to go in for a cup of coffee and a sandwich, but saw a sign hanging in front of the restaurant: "This store only serves white people, black people are not allowed." In the past, when Zoey saw such a sign, he would always shrug his shoulders and walk away. For some reason, today he felt unparalleled anger, because he felt not only insulted but also deceived. Zoey saw a demonstration team composed of hundreds of black people walking from the other side of the road, holding up signs that read "We demand equality!" He forgot his hunger, went up to join the ranks of the demonstration, and shouted together with everyone in his somewhat hoarse but very loud voice:
    "Oppose racial discrimination!"

    黑人祖伊的遭遇
    司马亮
    2月上旬一个初春的早晨，住在纽约黑人区的给饭店看门的老祖伊·史密斯起得特别早，因为他从报纸上知道，许多教堂、俱乐部、学校和大学都正在举行“黑人历史周”的展览和讲座，他决定要利用这个休假的机会去好好参观一下。
    祖伊今年五十多了，没念过几年书，只是在小的时候从老祖父的口中听到过一些关于黑人的故事，对于黑人的历史是知道得很少的。据报纸说，那些好心肠的白人举办的“黑人历史周”，是要详尽地研究和介绍美国黑人的历史，黑人对美国历史的影响，和黑人在文学、艺术、科学和经济上的成就，祖伊认为这是一个增广见识的好机会。他甚至产生了这样一种想法：白人先生们对黑人的历史和作用表现出如此的热心和重视，美国黑人受歧视和迫害的痛苦日子这回也许是要到头了。
    老祖伊决定先到市立图书馆去看看在那里举行的展览。他走出了那拥挤和肮脏的黑人区，看到马路上两旁的杨树正在发芽，一阵阵春风迎面吹来，他觉得今天的天气特别好。他在街角的卖报亭买了一份当天的“纽约时报”，刚好一辆公共汽车停在路边的车站上，他赶忙跨了上去。因为今天心里特别畅快的缘故吧，老祖伊好像觉得车上坐着的人都对他以微笑相迎。他看到一个空座位就坐了下来，把报纸打开。第一版的两个大字标题马上吸引住他。“洛克菲勒州长强调：没有那一国的人民能够拿出像美国黑人所取得的如此迅速的发展和进步的记录”，“华格纳市长说：黑人对纽约做出的贡献的历史对全体公民有无法估计的好处”。祖伊把老花镜从口袋里掏出来，正要把详细的内容读一读。身后响起了卖票员粗暴的声音：“黑鬼，滚到后面去！”祖伊才想起了他一时不留神，坐到白人专座来了。他无可奈何地站起来走到车后厢去，那里已经挤满了黑人。祖伊站到一个角落里，望着车外发怔，好像觉得天色忽然变得阴暗，他出门时候的那种兴致消减了大半。
    到了市立图书馆，他吃力地爬完了二十多级台阶，买了一张入场卷，走进了大门。在一个大厅的门口挂着“美国黑人历史展览”的牌子，他正想往里面走，看到里面正在参观的都是些服饰讲究的白种绅士和太太，他想到过去的惯例和刚才汽车上的吆喝声，不禁有点犹疑了。黑人是否让进去呢？是否有专给黑人设的展览室呢？他有礼貌地问那守门的人道：“我可以进去吗？”
    “唔，进去吧，可别往老爷太太们身上挤，别把东西弄坏，别把地弄脏，别……”老祖伊以极大忍耐听完他的训示。
    大厅里布置得相当漂亮，展览品也很丰富，有图表、有实物。祖伊看完之后的确得到了不少有益的知识。譬如：他们的祖先——一千多万黑人是在十六到十八世纪从非洲作为奴隶被贩运到美洲去的。这些黑人被迫在农场中进行着沉重的劳动，生产烟草、棉花、粮食和其他农作物，他们的劳役创造了美国的财富和繁荣。美国的黑人从1861年到1865年经过了流血的斗争，取得了奴隶制度的废除。他们由于遭受共同的奴役和苦难，形成了传统的黑人文化，而他们的诗歌、音乐、民谣和习俗对于美国的艺术和文学有着无法磨灭的贡献。在每一次为了保卫美国的战争中，黑人都曾英勇地献出过无数的鲜血和生命。在第二次世界大战中就有整个是黑人组成的部队参加战斗，在意大利战线上作战的美国第五军，其中第九十二师几乎全是黑人。在美国当代文化学术界中，有着一连串光辉的黑人名字：保尔·罗伯逊、杜波依斯、兰斯敦·休士、斯特陵·布朗、奥文·道得孙、威廉·格兰特·斯第尔、乔治·华盛顿·卡维……那么种族主义者凭什么要把黑人说成是一个劣等的民族呢？祖伊一方面感到作为一个黑人的骄傲，同时也感到莫名的愤慨。
    但是祖伊发现他从报纸上知道的许多关于黑人今天景况的事实，展览会里却完全没有提及。譬如：在美国南部五百万合乎选举年龄的黑人中有三百八十万被剥夺了选举权，在佛罗里达等五个州中的一百二十四万二千多名黑人学龄儿童中只有三千多名被允许进入白人学校，不少州通过了种族隔离的法律，许许多多旅馆、饭店、戏院、图书馆甚至动物园都禁止黑人入内，三分之一的黑人家庭属于美国最穷苦的家庭，在美国南部从1955年到1958年四年内发生了五百三十起杀人、殴打、爆炸和聚众袭击的迫害黑人的事件……祖伊心里想：难道这些不都是有关美国黑人的活生生的历史吗？
    这个老黑人茫然地走出了市立图书馆。他自言自语问道：“黑人既然对美国的历史和文化有这末大的贡献，为什么到今天还一直要受白人的压迫和歧视呢？祖伊禁不住低声哼起美国黑人的一首古老的民歌来：
    “我们种的是麦子，
    他们给我们的是苞米；
    他们烤好了面包，
    他们给我们面包皮；
    我们筛米做饭，
    他们叫我们吃粗糠；
    我们去皮切肉，
    他们叫我们吃肉皮；
    他们就是这样
    欺骗我们；
    我们撇出了奶油，
    他们给我们没奶油的牛奶；
    还说这对黑人够好了。”
    祖伊才想起今早赶着出来还没有吃早饭，现在已经是吃中饭的时间了。他走向附近一家餐馆，想进去喝一杯咖啡、吃一份夹肉面包，却看到餐馆门前挂着一个牌子：“本店只招待白人，黑人免进”。在过去，当祖伊看到这样的牌子，总是耸耸肩就走开了。不知怎的，今天他感到无比的愤怒，因为他觉得不仅是受了侮辱，而且受了欺骗。祖伊看见从路的那头正走来一支由数百个黑人组成的示威队伍，他们高举着“我们要求平等！”的牌子。他忘记了饥饿，迎上去参加了示威的行列，用他那有点沙哑但是却十分宏亮的声音和大家一齐喊道：
    “反对种族歧视！”
