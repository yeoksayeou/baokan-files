Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 13th. Chinese Consul General in Jakarta, Li Jusheng, went to Bandung on the 9th to hold talks with the West Java military authorities regarding the repatriation of Overseas Chinese from West Java. Li Jusheng also visited some Overseas Chinese residential camps to express sincere condolences to the Overseas Chinese who were forced to move out of the county towns.

Consul General Li Jusheng returned to Jakarta on the evening of the 12th.

On the 10th and 11th, Li Jusheng visited Lieutenant Colonel Marwoto, Chief of Staff of the 6th Military Region of West Java, twice in Bandung. They consulted on the issue of sending Overseas Chinese who requested repatriation back to China. Lieutenant Colonel Marwoto assured Consul General Li Jusheng that the preparatory work for sending Overseas Chinese from all parts of West Java back to China had been completed, and that Overseas Chinese from various places could go to Jakarta on the 12th to gather there.

According to a notice later received by Li Jusheng from the West Java Army authorities, due to obstruction from certain quarters, the Overseas Chinese could not go to Jakarta before February 14th. This means that the work of sending Overseas Chinese on board ships back to China will be delayed. As previously reported, the ships welcoming the Overseas Chinese back to China have already arrived in Jakarta.

More than 400 Overseas Chinese in Lingwang who wished to return to China had already set off on the 11th to concentrate in Jakarta with the help of the local military and political authorities. On the way, they were detained in Bandung, and they are still waiting in Bandung to continue their journey.

Accompanied by West Java military and political officials, Consul General Li Jusheng visited the Overseas Chinese residential camps in Majalengka, Lingwang, Cimahi, Cianjur, and Sukabumi on the 11th and 12th and expressed his heartfelt condolences to the Overseas Chinese. When Consul General Li and Indonesian military and political officials asked about the wishes of the Overseas Chinese, they unanimously replied that they hoped to return to their motherland as soon as possible. Many Overseas Chinese have already packed their luggage, ready to go to Jakarta under the escort of the Indonesian authorities to board ships and return home.

Consul General Li Jusheng had cordial conversations with the Overseas Chinese. These Overseas Chinese who had suffered greatly were very moved by the concern shown by their motherland. They said that when they saw the Consul General of their motherland in their misfortune, they felt as if they had seen their own mother. They all expressed that they were determined to participate in socialist construction as soon as they arrived in the motherland.

Consul Mao Xinyu, who accompanied Consul General Li Jusheng to West Java, went to Tasikmalaya, Ciamis, Purwakarta, Bekasi, and Karawang to express his condolences to the Overseas Chinese in those places.

    我国驻雅加达总领事和西爪哇军事当局
    商谈西爪哇华侨归国问题
    新华社雅加达13日电　中国驻雅加达总领事李菊生9日到万隆去就送西爪哇华侨回国问题同西爪哇军事当局举行会谈。李菊生还访问了一些华侨居留营，向被迫迁出县城以外地区的华侨表示诚恳的慰问。
    李菊生总领事于12日晚回到雅加达。
    10日和11日，李菊生在万隆曾两次访问西爪哇第六军区参谋长马尔沃托中校。他们就要求回国的华侨送回中国去的问题进行了磋商。马尔沃托中校向李菊生总领事保证，关于送西爪哇各地华侨回国的准备工作已经完成，各地华侨可以在12日前往雅加达，在那里集合。
    据李菊生后来接到的西爪哇陆军当局的通知，由于某些方面的阻挠，华侨不能在2月14日以前到雅加达去。这意味着，送华侨上船回国的工作将要受到耽搁。前已报道，迎接华侨回国的船只已经到达雅加达。
    在林望的四百多位希望回国的华侨在当地军政当局的帮助下已在11日动身前来雅加达集中。途中，他们在万隆被扣留了，到现在为止，他们还在万隆等待继续前进。
    李菊生总领事在西爪哇军政官员的陪同下，在11日和12日曾到马渣连加、林望、芝马嘘、展玉和苏加武眉去视察华侨居留营，并向华侨表示衷心的慰问。当李总领事和印度尼西亚军政官员问到华侨的愿望时，他们一致回答说，他们希望尽快回到祖国。有许多华侨已经准备行李，准备在印度尼西亚当局护送下到雅加达上船回国。
    李菊生总领事同华侨进行了亲切的谈话。这些饱受苦难经历的华侨受到祖国对他们表示的关心之后非常感动。他们说，当他们在不幸的时候看到祖国的总领事的时候，他们感到他们似乎看到了自己的母亲。他们全都表示，他们决心在一到祖国之后就参加社会主义建设。
    同李菊生总领事一起到西爪哇的毛欣欲领事，曾到打横、尖美士、普哇加达、易卡西和加拉横慰问那些地方的华侨。
