Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang. According to official statistics reported by the Korean Central News Agency: In January, the DPRK's total industrial output value plan was fulfilled by more than 103% in heavy industry and 109% in light industry (excluding local industries).

In the January industrial output value plan, the coal industry completed 102.6%, the power industry 105.1%, ferrous metal mining 103.4%, ferrous metal smelting industry 110.6%, non-ferrous metal smelting industry 100.2%, heavy machinery manufacturing industry 100.3%, textile industry 105.6%, and daily necessities industry 100.2%.

Compared with January last year, the industrial output of iron ore increased to 158.1%, pig iron 158.9%, steel 154.2%, steel materials 171.6%, cement 152.4%, cotton fabrics and rayon fabrics 133.3%, and glass sheets 230%.

The steel output in January reached more than four times the average monthly output in 1949 before the Korean War. Workers at the Chongjin Steel Plant completed the January plan on January 28, producing more than 1,300 tons of steel and 590 tons of rolled steel more than in the same month last year. Workers in the pig iron workshop of the Hwanghae Iron Works also overfulfilled the January production target by 1.5% on the 28th, producing more than 3,800 tons of pig iron more than in January last year.

In response to the call of the Workers' Party of Korea to "increase production with existing equipment," Korean workers have devoted themselves to creative labor to tap and mobilize all potential and reserve forces in order to increase production and prepare for the second five-year plan starting next year.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague. The Czechoslovak people, who achieved significant achievements on the industrial production front last year, have again achieved new and more brilliant results with great enthusiasm since the beginning of this year.

According to preliminary statistics from the Czechoslovak State Statistical Office, the raw coal production task was fulfilled by 102.1% in January. Coal miners delivered 145,500 tons of coal more to the state. The largest hard coal center in Czechoslovakia, the Ostrava-Karvina coal region, mined 53,180 tons more hard coal for the country in January, overfulfilling the production task by 2.7%.

Power workers also completed the January production task with a score of 101.6%. The production task of thermal power generation was fulfilled by 105.6%. In January, a total of 1.5386 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity were produced nationwide, an increase of 17.3% compared with the same period last year. The production plan of the chemical industry was fulfilled by 100.7% in January, an increase of 8.6% compared with the same period last year. Steel production (excluding steel pipes) completed 101%.

These achievements are the result of the working people giving full play to their enthusiasm, tapping potential, and widely carrying out various forms of socialist labor competition. Taking the coal mining industry as an example, there are as many as 618 miner collectives participating in the competition for the title of "Socialist Labor Team," totaling more than 10,000 people.

On the basis of the production achievements achieved in January, the Czechoslovak working people will create better production results to welcome the great festival of the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia (May 9).

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest. Many industrial and mining enterprises in Romania completed and overfulfilled the January production plan ahead of schedule.

The broad masses of workers and staff in Romanian factories and enterprises have launched a vigorous socialist labor competition movement in the new year. Many factories and enterprises have achieved excellent production results. The country's largest Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine produced more than 8,100 tons of steel, more than 1,800 tons of pig iron, and more than 10,900 tons of steel materials for the country in January. Some steelworkers began producing February products from January 28. By adopting advanced experience and making full use of the production area of the open-hearth furnace, the steelworkers of this enterprise increased the utilization coefficient of the open-hearth furnace by more than 20% compared with the average utilization coefficient last year. The workers of the Resita Metallurgical Combine guaranteed to overproduce 10,000 tons of metallurgical products in 1960, but in January they overproduced 2,100 tons of metal products. The steel rolling workers of the Galan Red Steel Plant also overproduced 1,800 tons of steel materials in January.

In order to strongly support the metallurgical workers in the task of producing 281,000 tons more steel this year than last year, the Romanian people, especially the youth, have launched a movement to collect scrap iron. The Prahova region also held a scrap iron collection week. In January, the urban and rural youth of this region transported more than 1,000 tons of scrap iron to the Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine. The residents of Timișoara region collected 5,000 tons of scrap iron in less than a month. The residents of Bacău region also collected more than 3,000 tons of scrap iron and pig iron in January.

Coal miners have also achieved good results in the labor competition, overfulfilling the January task by 1.3%. The miners of the Jiu Valley, the main coal mining area in Romania, produced nearly 7,500 tons of coal more than planned in January.

In addition, oil workers, builders of the "Lenin" Hydropower Station, and workers in other industrial sectors have also achieved good results in the socialist labor competition in January.

    朝鲜一月份的钢产量  比去年同期增加54．2％
    新华社平壤电　据朝鲜中央通讯社援引官方统计报道：朝鲜1月份的工业总产值计划在重工业方面完成了103％以上，在轻工业方面（不包括地方工业）完成了109％。
    在1月份的工业产值计划中，煤炭工业完成了102．6％，电力工业105．1％，黑色金属采矿103．4％，黑色金属冶炼工业110．6％，有色金属冶炼工业100．2％，重型机器制造工业100．3％，纺织工业105．6％，日用必需品工业100．2％。
    同去年1月份相比，铁矿石的工业产量增加到158．1％，生铁158．9％，钢154．2％，钢材171．6％，水泥152．4％，棉织品和人造纤维织品133．3％，玻璃板230％。
