    Friendship Between Two Generations
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Li Nan
    As the great festival of the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is approaching, we found Ira Kurishenko in a building on Lenin Avenue. She is the daughter of the Soviet pilot Kurishenko, who heroically sacrificed himself to help the Chinese people resist Japanese aggression. Kurishenko's deeds are already well known to everyone in China. Our visit to the Kurishenko family was to learn how the friendship between the older generation of Kurishenko and the Chinese people has flourished in the hearts of the new generation of young people. A family's two generations of friendship with the Chinese people must have many moving stories in between.
    Twenty Years Ago
    More than twenty years have passed. At that time, Kurishenko's young wife, Tamara, was only twenty-two or three years old, and her daughter, Ira, was just over three years old. Kurishenko, an excellent pilot and Communist Party member, was stationed at an airfield near Moscow. Life was happy and smooth, but Kurishenko's mood was not calm. The internationalist sense of responsibility of a Communist Party member stirred his thoughts and emotions.
    Twenty years ago, fascist aggression was rampant. Kurishenko watched his comrades go to Spain to fight the fascists, but he missed the opportunity because of a business trip.
    At the same time, Japanese imperialism was rampant on the land of China. Kurishenko thought to himself: If I can't go to Spain, then I will go to China if I have the opportunity!
    Sure enough, not long after, the issue of organizing volunteer pilots to go to China to help the Chinese people was discussed at a rally. The first to stand up was Kurishenko. "Write me down!" - he expressed his determination in such short and powerful words.
    Her husband's decision caused a great shock in his wife's heart. As the wife of a soldier and a pilot, she had long been accustomed to separation, but previous separations were due to work needs, while this time it was voluntary to go to another country to fight the aggressors. Tamara Alekseyevna wanted to persuade her husband to stay, but she knew Kurishenko's character very well: once a decision was made, nothing could change it.
    This is my internationalist duty as a Communist Party member. But about my whereabouts in China, you can't ask anyone, and you can't tell anyone. - Kurishenko said goodbye to his wife and daughter.
    In June 1939, Kurishenko led a volunteer air force detachment to China to help the Chinese people resist Japan. In October, when Captain Kurishenko dispatched his men to bomb the Japanese troops entrenched in Wuhan at that time, he shot down six Japanese planes. However, the heroic Soviet pilot's plane was also damaged. When it flew back over Wanxian, the fuselage lost its balance and landed in the Yangtze River. Because the Kuomintang authorities failed to rescue him in time, the mighty Yangtze River swept away the plane and the pilot, taking Kurishenko's life.
    Then, on a gloomy autumn day in Moscow, Tamara Alekseyevna received a brief, heartbreaking notice: "He died while performing an important mission."
    Thus, Kurishenko wrote a page of friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people with his own life and blood; he will forever live in the hearts of the Chinese people.
          A New Generation of Friendship
    More than ten years have passed. Under the care of the Soviet state, Kurishenko's orphan Ira grew up. She successfully completed elementary school and finished middle school. During the Great Patriotic War, she and her mother were evacuated to Kazan on the Volga River. After the war, they returned to Moscow. Ira vaguely knew that her father had died on Chinese soil, but she didn't know the details at all, and it was inconvenient to ask anyone about it!
    New China was founded. The deeds of the Soviet volunteer air force during the War of Resistance Against Japan were gradually revealed in Chinese newspapers and periodicals. Ira also learned some things. She heard that there was a cemetery for Soviet volunteer air force personnel in Wuhan. Ira once talked to her mother like this: If my father really sacrificed in China, then he must be buried in Wuhan. But it is a long way to go, and it may not be possible to find my father's grave!
    After graduating from middle school, Ira entered the Moscow Machine Tool Institute to continue her studies. There were many young people from China in this college studying with Ira. Like every Soviet youth, Ira had a good impression of Chinese classmates, especially because of her father's relationship, she had deep feelings, although she had never talked about her father's history with Chinese classmates.
    She quickly became familiar with the Chinese youth, helping them learn Russian and other subjects. During the holidays, she went with them to the suburbs for picnics, and to the cinema, theater, and museum. During the internship, they also went to the factory workshop together. During the summer vacation, they went to the farm together to participate in labor.
    Once, several Chinese youths sang a beautiful Chinese song. The enthusiastic melody of this song attracted Ira. After the song ended, the Chinese students said to Ira: This song praises a Russian who came to help the Chinese people when they were in trouble, and finally died on Chinese soil.
    "What kind of person is this person?" Ira was deeply interested in the friendship of the people praised in this song.
    "He is a Soviet eagle, a pilot, and his surname is the same as yours, also called Kurishenko. Although there are many people with the same surname in the Soviet Union, maybe he is a member of your family!"
    "He must be my father!" Ira exclaimed.
    The Chinese youths studying at the same school as Ira had even deeper feelings for Ira.
    Letters also came from China. The first letter was written by a young medical worker from Wanxian, Sichuan. When Kurishenko sacrificed himself, he was still a child. He wrote to the "Soviet Woman" magazine from far away Wanxian, and this letter was later transferred to "Red Star Newspaper". He hoped to find Kurishenko's family. In the letter, he talked in detail about the circumstances of Kurishenko's sacrifice and the location of his current burial.
    Correspondence with Chinese friends began like this. Tamara and Ira learned from these letters how the Chinese people were filled with deep affection and gratitude for Kurishenko's internationalist behavior, and were concerned and mindful of Kurishenko's family. Chinese friends also learned about the situation of Kurishenko's family.
          Deep Affection
    Tamara and Ira's mother and daughter's wish to go to their loved one's grave to sweep and pay respects was realized. In September 1958, they received an invitation to visit China. When Ira mentioned this unforgettable event in her life, she always said with emotion: This is really a manifestation of the deep affection of the Chinese people. We mother and daughter, we two ordinary Russian women, received such warm hospitality in China for a month and a half, which is unforgettable for a lifetime.
    Tamara and Ira will always remember meeting Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai at our National Day reception, shaking hands with them, and talking to them. They flew from Beijing to Chongqing, and then took a boat to Wanxian, where they participated in Kurishenko's reburial ceremony.
    Last September, Ira graduated from the Machine Tool Institute. She said goodbye to her Chinese students in the same class and went to work in the Machine Tool Industry Design Bureau, embarking on the road of independent life.
    There are also Chinese youths interning at Ira's workplace. As in school, she also established close friendships with Chinese comrades here. Ira always helps first whenever Chinese comrades need help.
    Many drawings in the design bureau are sent to China, and these complex and detailed drawings also include a share of Ira's labor. She said: My mood is always very excited every time our design institute designs drawings for China. I feel happy to be able to contribute a small amount of strength to China's socialist construction.
    Chinese bamboo curtains hang on the walls of Ira's house, and Chinese gifts are placed on the table. When the mother and daughter see these things, they always recall the green hills and clear waters of Wanxian and Kurishenko's cemetery overlooking the Yangtze River. They always feel the deep friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people in their hearts.

### 两代人的友谊

    两代人的友谊
    新华社记者　李楠
    在中苏友好同盟互助条约签订十周年这个伟大的节日快要来临的时候，我们在列宁大道上的一幢大楼里，找到了依拉·库里申科。她是志愿帮助中国人民反抗日本侵略者而英勇牺牲的苏联飞行员库里申科的女儿。关于库里申科的事迹在中国已经是大家早已熟知的了。我们访问库里申科的家庭是想了解一下老一代库里申科和中国人民的友谊如何在新一代青年人的心中繁荣发展。一个家庭的两代人同中国人民的友谊，这中间是应该有许多动人的事迹的。
    二十年前往事
    事情已经过去二十多年了。当时库里申科的年青的妻子塔玛拉才二十二、三岁，抱在怀中的女儿依拉才刚刚满三岁。优秀的飞行员、共产党员库里申科驻扎在莫斯科附近的飞机场上。生活是美满的、顺利的，但库里申科的心境并不平静。共产党员的国际主义的责任感激动着他的思想和情绪。
    二十年前，法西斯侵略势力正在猖獗。库里申科眼看着同志们去西班牙同法西斯战斗，而自己却因为出差，而耽误了这一时机。
    也正在这时，日本帝国主义正在中国的大地上横行。库里申科心中想道：去不成西班牙，那么有机会就到中国去罢！
    果然不久，在一次集会上谈到了组织志愿飞行人员到中国去帮助中国人民的问题。第一个站起来的就是库里申科。“把我写上罢！”——他这样简短有力地表示了自己的决心。
    丈夫的这一决定在妻子的心中引起了很大的震动。作为军人、飞行人员的妻子，她对于离别已经老早就习惯了，但是以前的离别是职务上的需要，而这次却是自愿地到别国去同侵略者作战。塔玛拉·阿列克塞耶夫娜想劝丈夫留下，可是她十分了解库里申科的性格：一经决定了的事情，那是甚么也不能改变的。
    这是我应尽的共产党员的国际义务。只是关于我到中国去的行踪，你甚么人也不能问，对甚么人也不能说。——库里申科就这样离别了自己的妻子和女儿。
    1939年6月，库里申科率领一个志愿空军大队去中国，帮助中国人民抗日。10月里，库里申科大队长出动轰炸当时盘踞武汉的日军时，击落六架日寇飞机。但这位英雄的苏联飞行员的飞机也受了伤，在折返飞临万县上空时，机身失去平衡，降落在长江中。由于国民党当局不及时抢救，浩浩荡荡的长江之水卷去了飞机和飞行员，夺去了库里申科的生命。
    接着，在莫斯科一个深秋的阴晦的日子里，塔玛拉·阿列克塞耶夫娜接到了一封简短的、令人心碎的通知：“在执行一项重要的出差任务时牺牲了。”
    于是库里申科用他自己的生命和鲜血写下了中苏两国人民的友谊的一页；他在中国人民的心中永远生存。
          新一代的友谊
    十多年过去了。在苏维埃国家的关怀下库里申科的遗孤依拉成长起来了。她顺利地读完小学，念完中学。卫国战争期间，她和母亲一道，疏散到了伏尔加河畔的喀山。战争结束后，她们又回到了莫斯科。依拉隐隐约约地知道，父亲是在中国的土地上牺牲的，但是详细的情况却一点儿也不知道，而且根本不便向人询问啊！
    新中国成立了。关于抗日战争期间苏联志愿空军人员的事迹才逐渐在中国的报刊上披露出来。依拉也知道了一些，她听说在武汉有苏联志愿空军人员的公墓。依拉曾经这样和母亲谈论：如果父亲真的牺牲在中国的话，那么一定也是埋骨在武汉。但是千里迢迢，未必能够前往寻找父亲的坟墓！
    中学毕业后，依拉升入莫斯科车床工具学院继续学习。这个学院里有来自中国的许多青年，和依拉一起学习。像每个苏联青年一样，依拉对中国同学抱着好感，尤其是因为父亲的关系，便怀着深厚的感情，虽然她没有和中国同学谈到过父亲的历史。
    她和中国青年很快就相处得很熟悉，帮助他们学习俄文和其它功课。假日里，她和他们一道到郊外去野游，一道到电影院、戏院、博物馆。实习期间，他们又一道到工厂车间实习。暑假期间，他们又一块儿到农庄去参加劳动。
    有一次，几个中国青年唱着一首动听的中国歌曲，这歌曲的热情的旋律吸引了依拉。歌声结束以后，中国学生对依拉说：这里歌颂的是一个俄罗斯人，他曾经在中国人民艰难的时候，前来帮助中国人民，最后在中国的土地上牺牲了。
    “这个人是甚么样的人呢？”依拉对这首歌曲中所歌颂的人民的友谊深感兴趣。
    “他是苏联的雄鹰，一个飞行人员，而且他的姓和你的一样，也叫库里申科。虽然苏联同姓的人也不少，但也许他是你的一家人吧！”
    “他一定是我的父亲啊！”依拉感叹着说。
    和依拉在一个学校学习的中国青年们对依拉的情谊更加深厚了。
    从中国也来了信件。第一封信是四川万县一个青年医务工作者写来的。当库里申科牺牲时，他也还是一个小孩子。他从遥远的万县写信给“苏联妇女”杂志，这封信后来又转到“红星报”。他希望能够找到库里申科的家庭。在信中，他详细地谈到了库里申科牺牲的经过和现在安葬的地点。
    和中国朋友的通信就这样开始了。塔玛拉和依拉从这些来信中，知道了中国人民如何对库里申科的国际主义行为充满了深情和感激，对库里申科的家庭怀着关怀和惦念。中国的朋友们也知道了库里申科家人的情况。
          深情厚谊
    塔玛拉和依拉母女俩想到自己的亲人墓前去扫祭一番的愿望实现了。1958年9月，她们接到了邀请，到中国访问。依拉提到生活中这次难忘的事件时，总是充满感情地说：这真是中国人民的深情厚谊的表现。我们母女，我们两个普通的俄罗斯妇女，在中国一个半月所受到的热情招待是令人终生难忘的。
    塔玛拉和依拉永远记得在我国国庆招待会上会见毛泽东主席和周恩来总理，和他们握了手，谈了话。她们从北京坐飞机到达重庆，然后乘船达到万县，在万县参加了库里申科的迁葬仪式。
    去年9月，依拉在车床工具学院毕业了。她送别了同班的中国学生，自己就到车床工业设计局去工作，走上了独立生活的道路。
    在依拉工作的地方，也有中国青年在那里实习。和在学校中一样，她在这里也和中国同志建立了亲密的友谊。凡是中国同志需要帮助的，依拉总是首先帮助。
    设计局有许多图样是寄往中国的，这些复杂细致的图样当中也有依拉的一分劳动。她说道：我们设计院每次为中国设计图样时，我的心情总是很激动。能为中国的社会主义建设贡献一点微小力量，我感到幸福。
    依拉家里的墙壁上挂着中国的竹帘，桌子上摆着中国的礼品。当母女俩看到这些东西时，总要回想起那青山绿水的万县和那俯瞰长江的库里申科的墓园，她们的心中也总是感到中苏两国人民的深情厚谊。
