Eisenhower Incites Popular Anger in Latin America
Masses in Argentina and Uruguay Hold Anti-American Demonstrations and Rallies
Chilean Popular Action Front and Student Federation Condemn US Conspiracy to Interfere in Cuba

Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, February 27th - On the evening of February 26th, when US President Eisenhower arrived in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, intense anti-American demonstrations and rallies took place. This mass rally was organized by the Argentine Socialist Party, and the central slogan of the meeting was: "Yankees Go Home." Socialist Party Secretary Muniz and other speakers at the rally condemned the policies adopted by the United States towards the Latin American people and Eisenhower's visit. The public attending the rally repeatedly shouted "Long Live Fidel Castro" and burned a pig's head effigy draped with the American flag.

After the meeting, the masses began a demonstration march, shouting "Yankees are the scourge of Latin America," "Argentina yes, Yankees no," "Support Castro, Oppose Eisenhower." Several American flags hanging from the City Hall were torn down by angry protesters. The police arrested thirteen demonstrators, including four Socialist Party city council candidates and one congressional candidate. The police also announced that a total of fifty demonstrators were arrested on the 26th.

On the evening of the 26th, leaflets opposing President Eisenhower's visit and supporting the Cuban revolution were distributed in the downtown area. Some of the leaflets were signed by the Argentine University Federation, while others were signed by the Peronist Party Youth Organization, the People's Radical Civic Union Youth Organization, and other organizations.

Xinhua News Agency, February 28th - Montevideo: At the call of the Uruguayan Socialist Party and other mass organizations, a rally was held in the Uruguayan capital on the 27th to oppose Eisenhower's visit to Uruguay. Demonstrators shouted slogans such as "No to Imperialism!" and "Down with US Imperialism!" Clashes broke out between demonstrators and police.

Students of the Uruguayan Law School issued a statement on Eisenhower's visit, condemning Eisenhower's visit as an attempt to strengthen Uruguay's dependence on the United States. The statement expressed opposition to Eisenhower's visit to Uruguay.

The United Workers' Center of Uruguay issued a statement expressing support for Cuba and condemning the arms race provoked by the United States.

The Uruguayan "El Sol" newspaper published a special issue on the 26th, summarizing the various crimes committed by the United States against the Latin American people. The newspaper fiercely condemned US exploitation of Latin America.

Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, February 28th - The Chilean Popular Action Front, composed of six political parties, issued a statement today on Eisenhower's visit, saying that Eisenhower's visit to several Latin American countries is "part of a plan by the US State Department and the Pentagon." One of its purposes is to win the unconditional support of Latin American countries for the crime of intervention in Cuba that is being prepared. "The purpose of this intervention crime is to overthrow the People's Revolutionary Government of Fidel Castro."

The statement pointed out: Eisenhower is coming to Chile and Latin America for a visit at a time when the surging and combative movement of support and defense of Cuba is developing, the people's liberation movement is expanding, the strength of the people's struggle is increasing, and the front of struggle against dictatorship and against the implementation of policies that violate national interests is being consolidated. The statement said:

"Eisenhower's visit is an international political conspiracy of US imperialism, a new and arrogant step to consolidate its policies of economic, military, political and cultural domination over these countries." However, the statement said, "As in other countries of the Americas, a great awakening demanding liberation is taking place in Chile, and there is no doubt that this awakening will prevent the implementation of all overt and covert plans that prompted the US president to visit our country."

Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, February 27th - The Chilean Student Federation recently wrote a letter on behalf of 25,000 university students nationwide to US President Eisenhower, who is about to visit Chile, condemning US intervention in Cuba and the so-called "Pan-American System" promoted by the United States. The letter said, "If the United States intervenes in Cuba, it will be an unforgivable atrocity. This atrocity could make people see clearly the moral basis of the Pan-American system."

Xinhua News Agency, February 28th - Buenos Aires: Under extremely tight security, Eisenhower left Buenos Aires on the morning of the 27th, where anti-American demonstrations were constantly taking place, and flew to the coastal city of Mar del Plata, 400 kilometers south of the Argentine capital. In the afternoon, he flew to Bariloche, a resort in the western mountains of Argentina, where he held secret talks with Argentine President Frondizi.

Before Eisenhower arrived in Bariloche by plane in the afternoon, many large anti-American slogans were painted near the road of the Llao Llao Hotel where he was scheduled to stay.

    艾森豪威尔在拉丁美洲激起众怒
    阿根廷和乌拉圭群众举行反美示威和集会
    智利人民行动阵线和学联谴责美国干涉古巴的阴谋
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯27日电　当美国总统艾森豪威尔26日到达阿根廷首都的这天晚上，阿根廷首都举行了激烈的反美示威和集会。这次群众集会是由阿根廷社会党组织的，会议的中心口号是：“美国佬滚出去”。社会党书记穆尼斯和其它发言者在集会上谴责了美国对拉丁美洲人民所采取的政策和艾森豪威尔的访问。参加集会的公众不断高喊菲德尔·卡斯特罗万岁，并且焚烧了盖着美国国旗的猪头傀儡。
    会后，群众开始示威游行，他们高呼“美国佬是拉丁美洲的祸根”，“要阿根廷，不要美国佬”，“支持卡斯特罗，反对艾森豪威尔”。市政厅悬挂的几面美国国旗被愤怒的群众撕毁。警察逮捕了十三名示威者，其中有四名社会党市议员候选人和一名众议员候选人。警察还宣布，26日共逮捕了五十名示威者。
    26日晚上在市中心地区散发了反对艾森豪威尔总统访问和支持古巴革命的传单。有些传单是由阿根廷大学联合会署名的，另外一些传单是庇隆主义党青年组织、人民激进公民联盟青年组织和其他组织署名的。
    据新华社28日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：在乌拉圭社会党和其他群众组织号召下，乌拉圭首都27日举行大会，反对艾森豪威尔到乌拉圭访问。示威者高喊“不要帝国主义！”和“打倒美帝国主义！”的口号。示威的人和警察发生了冲突。
  乌拉圭法律学院学生就艾森豪威尔访问发表声明，谴责艾森豪威尔这次访问是为了加强乌拉圭对美国的依赖。声明表示反对艾森豪威尔到乌拉圭访问。
    乌拉圭劳动人民统一中心发表声明表示支持古巴，并且谴责美国挑起的军备竞赛。
    乌拉圭“太阳报”26日出版专号，把美国对拉丁美洲人民所犯下的种种罪行作了总结。这家报纸猛烈谴责美国对拉丁美洲的剥削。
  据新华社圣地亚哥28日电　由六个政党组成的智利人民行动阵线今天就艾森豪威尔的访问发表声明说，艾森豪威尔对拉丁美洲几个国家的访问是“美国国务院和五角大楼的计划的一部分”。它的目的之一是争取拉丁美洲国家对正在准备的干涉古巴罪行的无条件的支持。“这个干涉罪行的目的在于推翻菲德尔·卡斯特罗的人民革命政府。”
  声明指出：艾森豪威尔正是在这样一个时候前来智利和拉丁美洲访问的：各国支持和保卫古巴的汹涌澎湃的战斗性运动日益发展，人民的解放运动日益扩大，人民斗争的力量日益强大，并且正在日益巩固反独裁和反对执行违反民族利益的政策的斗争阵线。声明说：
  “艾森豪威尔的访问是美帝国主义的国际政治阴谋，是为了巩固它对这些国家实行经济、军事、政治和文化统治政策的一个新的和跋扈的步骤。”但是，声明说，“像在美洲其他国家一样，在智利正发生着要求解放的巨大觉醒，毫无疑问，这一觉醒将阻止促使美国总统访问我国的一切公开和秘密计划的执行。”
    据新华社圣地亚哥27日电　智利学生联合会最近代表全国二万五千名大学生给即将访问智利的美国总统艾森豪威尔写了一封信，谴责美国对古巴的干涉和美国宣传的所谓“泛美体系”。这封信说，“美国如果干涉古巴，那将是不可饶恕的暴行。这种暴行可以使人们认清泛美制度的道义基础。”
    据新华社28日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：艾森豪威尔27日上午在极其森严的戒备下离开不断发生反美示威的布宜诺斯艾利斯市，乘飞机到阿根廷首都以南四百公里的海滨城市马德普拉塔城，并在下午飞往阿根廷西部山区休养地巴利罗赤，在那里同阿根廷总统弗朗迪西举行秘密会谈。
    在艾森豪威尔下午乘飞机到达巴利罗赤以前，在他预定要居住的亚奥—亚奥旅馆的马路附近，粉刷了许多反美的大幅标语。
