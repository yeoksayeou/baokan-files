(Reported by our newspaper) A vigorous mass movement of industry supporting agricultural technical transformation is unfolding nationwide.

In this movement, the leading departments of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, in accordance with the spirit of the General Line, have vigorously educated the broad masses of workers and staff about industry supporting agriculture, the people's communes, and the worker-peasant alliance. At the same time, they mobilized relevant factories and mining enterprises to formulate plans, take measures, and launch mass movements for industry to support agriculture. After Harbin City adopted these methods, a movement to do good deeds to support agricultural technical transformation was immediately launched throughout the city. Factories and mining enterprises immediately took out their surplus materials and equipment, including 350 agricultural machines, 700 power machines, more than 200 various machine tools and forging equipment, and more than 80,000 various tools and bearings to support agriculture. Many factories and mining enterprises in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have also actively launched movements for industry to support agriculture, and have created many effective methods:

One, "Factories linked with communes, assigned responsibility by area, taking full responsibility," to support agricultural technical transformation. Of the 412 people's communes in Liaoning Province, 386 have already been linked with factories. Lanzhou City adopted the method of one factory supporting one commune. According to statistics from 12 factories, since July of last year, they have produced more than 175,000 various machines and tools for the communes they support. Young workers and staff in more than 1,000 factories in Wuhan City are preparing to use waste materials to manufacture simple machine tools, equipment, and tools in their spare time to help more than 1,000 brigades in the city's 15 counties establish more than 1,000 agricultural machinery and tool repair stations, and establish regular contact.

Two, organize service teams, establish repair networks, help people's communes repair machinery and tools, and impart technology. More than 70 technicians and technical personnel from the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory and Pesticide Machinery Factory organized a service team, and used their holidays to repair two diesel engines, 13 threshing machines, and 18 sprayers for the Jinqiao People's Commune in Pudong County. They also modified a drilling machine, designed several new agricultural implements, and imparted technical knowledge and experience to the peasants. Recently, five special districts in Henan, including Luoyang and Nanyang, organized 19,889 service teams (groups) to repair 5.51 million pieces of machinery and agricultural implements for the people's communes. They also organized 32,955 workers and staff into 6,881 repair stations (groups) to go deep into water conservancy construction sites to repair tools.

Three, help people's communes train technical personnel. Many factories and mining enterprises, according to the requirements of the people's communes and the specific conditions of their own enterprises, adopt the methods of inviting people in to train apprentices, or forming technical service teams to send out, regularly going to the people's communes to impart technology, or cooperating with relevant departments to run short-term training classes to help people's communes train technical personnel. Many enterprises in Harbin, Chengdu, Luoyang and other places have undertaken the task of training technical personnel for the people's communes.

Four, help communes run factories, and vigorously support commune-run industry. According to statistics from nine units in Chengdu City, they have helped communes establish 37 various factories. Under the leadership of the Party committee, the trade union organizations of many factories and mines mobilized workers and staff to support commune-run industry in terms of materials, technology, and manpower; help communes train or send technical personnel to communes, and help commune-run industry improve product quality, reduce costs, and increase varieties.

    洋溢阶级友爱的热情　发扬共产主义的风格
    工农携手　厂社挂钩
    全国许多工厂大力支援农业现代化和公社工业化
    本报讯　一个轰轰烈烈的工业支援农业技术改造的群众运动，正在全国范围内展开。
    在这一运动中，各省、市、自治区的领导部门，都根据总路线的精神，在广大职工中大张旗鼓地进行了关于工业支援农业、关于人民公社和工农联盟的教育。同时，发动各有关厂矿企业制订规划，采取措施，开展工业支援农业的群众运动。哈尔滨市采取这些办法后，全市立即掀起一个为支援农业技术改造作件好事的运动，各厂矿企业立即拿出自己节余的物资和设备，共有农业机械三百五十台，动力机械七百台，各种机床、铸锻设备二百多台，各种工具、轴承八万余件支援农业。各省、市、自治区的许多厂矿企业也都积极地掀起工业支援农业的运动，并创造了许多行之有效的方法：
    一、“厂社挂钩、分片包干、一包到底”，支援农业技术改造。辽宁省全省四百一十二个人民公社，已有三百八十六个和工厂挂上了钩。兰州市采用一厂包一社的办法，据十二个厂统计，去年7月以来，已为他们包的公社生产了各种机械和工具十七万五千多件。武汉市一千多个工厂的青年职工，准备利用废料，在业余时间制造简易机床、设备和工具，帮助市属十五个县的一千多个大队建立一千多个农业机械、农具修配站，并分别建立经常联系。
    二、组织服务队、建立修配网，帮助人民公社检修机械和工具，传授技术。上海柴油机厂和农药机械厂七十多名技工和技术人员组织了服务队，利用假日为浦东县金桥人民公社修理了两台柴油机，十三台脱粒机，十八个喷雾器，改装了一台钻床，设计了几件新农具，并向农民传授了技术知识和经验。河南洛阳、南阳等五个专区最近组织了一万九千八百八十九个服务队（组）到人民公社修配了机械和农具五百五十一万件，还组织了三万二千九百五十五名职工分成六千八百八十一个修配站（组）深入水利建设工地修配工具。
    三、帮助人民公社培训技术力量。许多厂矿企业根据人民公社的要求和本企业的具体情况，采用请进来带徒弟，或组成技术服务队派出去，定期到人民公社传授技术，或协同有关部门办短期训练班，帮助人民公社培养技术力量。哈尔滨、成都、洛阳等地方的许多企业都承担了为人民公社培养技术人材的任务。
    四、帮助公社办工厂，大力支援社办工业。据成都市九个单位的统计，已分别帮助公社建立各种工厂三十七个。许多厂矿的工会组织在党委的领导下，发动职工在物质上、技术上和人力上支援社办工业；帮助公社培养或向公社输送技术人材，帮助社办工业提高产品质量、降低成本、增加品种。
