On the New Songs and Dances of the General Political Department Song and Dance Troupe
Ye Lin

The General Political Department Song and Dance Troupe is a large-scale military song and dance troupe with distinctive characteristics. Their performances are full of the heroic spirit of soldiers and a bright and healthy artistic style.

What impresses people most about this troupe is that it has a strong mixed choir of over a hundred men and women. Whether the songs they sing are majestic or lyrical, they sing with relatively rich expressiveness.

Recently, the song and dance troupe created a batch of new musical programs, including a large-scale vocal work "Long Live the Motherland." This work is the latest creation of poet Wei Feng and composer Shi Lemeng. This large-scale work seems to have a grand intention, to shape the heroic image of the Chinese people in various historical stages over the past hundred years against imperialism, feudalism, and the bureaucratic comprador class, as well as the revolutionary achievements of the Chinese Communist Party, so that people can be educated while cherishing the memory of the martyrs and revisiting the revolutionary history of the past. Although this work has encountered some difficulties due to its excessive generalization, making it impossible to concentrate on vividly portraying each decisive revolutionary historical event, the authors have poured full political enthusiasm into these three movements. The melody of the chorus has the author's consistent distinct style, with deep emotions and solid, powerful melodies, and some parts absorb the intonation elements of "Wanwanqiang," with strong national characteristics. The momentum at the beginning of the first movement, foreshadowing the coming of the revolutionary storm, and the lyrical female voice passage in the second movement, praising the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an, are both movingly written. This work requires the singers to bring out fiery enthusiasm, powerful volume, and accurate and clear language. It seems that these requirements have been met; especially the male voices have more opportunities to perform. If the soprano voices could be strengthened in volume and have more variety in timbre, it might seem more brilliant.

Establishing a new type of large chorus with rich expressiveness and clear stylistic characteristics is indeed not an easy task. It requires experienced leaders, singers with comprehensive training, long-term arduous training, and the cultivation of extremely keen mutual understanding and cooperation habits. It requires rich expressiveness cultivated from the rehearsal and performance of works of various styles and genres; of course, it also requires full political enthusiasm. The General Political Department Song and Dance Troupe is one of the large-scale choirs in our country that meets these requirements. Although there are still some limitations in performance skills, there is more magnificent momentum, and the skills of gentleness and delicacy are insufficient, and the theatrical effect of the performance is not yet solid. However, generally speaking, it already has the foundation for further development. As long as it continues to strengthen training and, in addition to continuing to develop the characteristics of the military choir and reflect military life in the scope of singing, it can also pay attention to absorbing various excellent works at home and abroad and further expand its artistic expressiveness, I believe it will definitely achieve greater progress.

Speaking of dance programs, the General Political Department Song and Dance Troupe's two new dances, "Immortal Warrior" and "Cotton Planting Girl," are also very good. "Immortal Warrior" shapes the image of a proletarian warrior with flesh and blood. It is based on the heroic deeds of Huang Jiguang. The temperament and heroic behavior of this great internationalist warrior are well reflected in the dance. In art, it has a strict dramatic structure, depicting the most critical plot in the battle, without superfluous branches, with a clear theme and prominent focus; the use of materials is based on realistic combat actions, absorbing the stunts and postures of classical dance, as well as certain elements of Shandong Drum Yangko and Jiaozhou Yangko for creation, which is both fresh and has national style. In addition to these factors, the success of this dance largely depends on the performance of the actors. Wu Wenfu, the actor who plays the immortal warrior, has outstanding achievements in this regard. He has real emotions, skilled techniques, can master difficult stunts in classical dance, and shows a lively and vigorous spirit on the stage. If there is anything lacking in this dance, it is some problems caused by the over-simplicity of the plot, which cannot portray the character from more aspects, such as being brave but lacking wit, and therefore seems not rich enough. It might be better if the role of other characters in the dance could be appropriately strengthened, and their relationship with each other could be strengthened to complement each other.

"Cotton Planting Girl" is a work of another style. It describes the hard work of a cotton planting girl, who finally turns the cotton field into a spring garden, blooming with colorful flowers, thus praising the creative labor in today's Great Leap Forward era, and people's beautiful wishes in labor. This dance is created on the basis of Uyghur dance. It "personifies" cotton into flowers that understand language, and echoes the labor and mood of the cotton planting girl. We know that Uyghur dance has many works with the same theme, such as "Melon Planting Dance" and "Labor Dance," etc., but those dances are mostly in the form of solo dances, and the object of labor is virtual on the stage, only expressed through dance, which is certainly a traditional form of expression with artistic characteristics. In the dance "Cotton Planting Girl," the object of labor directly participates in the dance by means of personification, which also creates another humorous and moving form of expression. Of course, developing solo dance into a form that combines solo dance and group dance should also be careful not to weaken or limit the solo dance by adding group dance. On this issue, this dance seems to have been solved well, creating some good experience.

The new songs and dances of the General Political Department Song and Dance Troupe are not limited to these, such as the male voice ensemble "Ga Ma Ling" and the dance "Shield," etc., all have different characteristics and are very good. Recently, they have also been actively engaged in creation and rehearsal, hoping that more and better new works will be produced in the near future.

    谈总政歌舞团的新歌舞
    叶林
    总政歌舞团是一个具有鲜明特点的大型军队歌舞团，他们的演出充满着豪迈的军人气概和艺术上的明朗健康的风格。
    这个团给人印象最深的是它拥有一个力量雄厚的百人以上的男女混声合唱团，他们演唱的歌曲无论是雄壮的或是抒情的，唱起来都有着比较丰富的表现力。
    最近，歌舞团创作了一批新的音乐节目，其中有一个大型声乐作品“祖国万岁”。这个作品是诗人魏风和作曲家时乐蒙的最近的作品。这个大型作品看来有着宏大的意图，想塑造出近百年来各个历史阶段中的反帝、反封建、反官僚买办阶级的中国人民的英雄形象，以及中国共产党的革命殊勋，使人们在缅怀先烈和重温过去的革命历史当中受到教育。尽管这个作品由于概括性过大而造成了一些困难，不能集中力量对各个有决定意义的革命历史事件进行形象的刻划，但在这三个乐章中作者倾注了饱满的政治热情。合唱的曲调具有作者一贯的鲜明风格，感情深厚，旋律坚实有力，有些地方吸收了“碗碗腔”的腔调因素，民族特点很浓。第一乐章开始时的那种预示着革命风暴即将降临的气势，和第二乐章中歌颂革命圣地延安的女声抒情乐段都写得动人。这个作品要求唱者拿出火一样的热情、强大的音量和准确清晰的语言。看来这些要求是做到了；特别是男声部有较多的表现机会，如果女高音声部能够在音量上加强一些，和在音色上多一些变化，可能会显得更有光采。
    建立一个表现力丰富、有明确风格特点的新型大合唱团，委实不是一件轻而易举的事，它需要有经验的领导者，有全面修养的演唱人员；需要进行长期的刻苦的磨炼，培养出极为敏锐的相互默契的合作习惯；需要从多种风格、多种体裁的作品的排练和演出中锻炼出丰富的表现力；当然，更需要有饱满的政治热情。总政歌舞团是我国目前符合这些要求的大型合唱团中的一个，尽管在表现技巧上还存在着某些限制，气魄宏亮有余，柔美纤秀的技巧则显得不足，演唱的剧场效果也还不够巩固，但总的说来，它已经具备了向前发展的基础，只要继续加强训练，并且在演唱范围上除了继续发展部队合唱团的特点，反映部队生活以外，还能够注意吸收国内外的各种优秀作品，更多地扩展自己的艺术表现力，相信一定可以得到更大的进步。
    谈到舞蹈节目，总政歌舞团的两个新舞蹈“不朽的战士”和“植棉姑娘”也是很好的。“不朽的战士”塑造了一个有血有肉的无产阶级战士的形象。它是以黄继光的英雄事迹为蓝本的，这位伟大国际主义战士的气质，英勇的行为，在舞蹈中都有较好的体现。在艺术上，它有着较严密的戏剧性结构，刻划了战斗中最关键性的情节，没有多余的枝叶，主题明确，重心突出；素材的运用是以现实的作战动作为基础，吸收了古典舞的特技、身段以及山东鼓子秧歌、胶州秧歌的某些因素来进行创作的，既有新鲜气息，又有民族风格。除了这些因素以外，这个舞蹈的成功，很大程度还决定于演员的表演。饰不朽战士的演员武文夫在这方面有着突出的成就，他有真实的感情，熟练的技巧，能掌握古典舞中困难的特技，在舞台上表现出生龙活虎般的气概。如果说这个舞蹈还有什么不足，那就是由于情节的过于单一而带来的一些问题，不能从较多的方面来刻划这个人物，如骁勇有余，机智不足，因而显得还不够丰富。倘使能够适当加强舞蹈中的其它人物的作用，加强他们之间的关系，相互衬托，可能会更好一些。
    “植棉姑娘”则是另一种风格的作品。它描写一个植棉姑娘的辛勤劳动，最后把棉田变成了春天的花园一样。开出了五彩缤纷的花朵，从而歌颂今天大跃进时代中创造性的劳动，和人们在劳动中的美好愿望。这个舞蹈是在维吾尔族舞蹈的基础上进行创作的，它使棉花“拟人化”成为解语的花朵，和植棉姑娘的劳动和心情相辉映。我们知道，维族舞蹈是有不少同样题材的作品的，如“种瓜舞”“劳动舞”等等，但那些舞蹈大都是独舞形式，劳动的对象在舞台上是虚拟的，只是通过舞蹈来表达，那固然是一种有艺术特点的传统表现形式。在“植棉姑娘”这个舞蹈中，劳动对象则用拟人的方法直接参加了舞蹈，却也创造了另一种有风趣的表现形式，也很优美动人。当然，把独舞发展成为独舞和群舞相结合的形式，也应当小心不要因为加进了群舞而减弱或限制了独舞。在这个问题上，这个舞蹈看来是解决得较好的，创造出了一些好经验。
    总政歌舞团的新歌舞还不止是这一些，如男声小合唱“尕马令”舞蹈“盾牌”等等，都各有不同的特点。也都是很好的。最近，他们还在不断地积极进行创作排练，希望在不久的将来，将有更多更好的新作品产生。
