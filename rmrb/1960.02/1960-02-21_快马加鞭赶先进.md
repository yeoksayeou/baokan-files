    Spurring the Horse to Catch Up with the Advanced
    Cheng Jianmin, First Secretary of the CPC Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Committee

    The Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture may be unfamiliar to many readers. It is located in the southeastern part of Qinghai Province, covering an area of more than 140,000 square kilometers. The famous Bayan Har Mountains and Mount Jiishi are within its borders, and the Yellow River runs across the entire prefecture from west to east. It is rich in water and grass, suitable for animal husbandry and agriculture, and has extremely rich mineral, aquatic, wildlife, and plant resources, as well as a large area of virgin forest. More than 70,000 hardworking and courageous Tibetan herdsmen live on this vast and rich land. In the decades before liberation, the Chiang Kai-shek and Ma Bufang bandit gangs carried out many massacres and plunders of the Guoluo people. The reactionary chieftains and feudal herdlords within the tribes cruelly oppressed and exploited the laboring herdsmen. Armed conflicts between ethnic groups and tribes continued year after year, resulting in a gradual decline in population, extremely blocked transportation, and the herdsmen living in a long-term primitive and very poor life.
    After liberation, we carried out a series of tasks in accordance with the Party's ethnic policies, gradually developed production, eradicated ethnic disputes inherited from history, stabilized social order, strengthened ethnic unity, and actively promoted ethnic regional autonomy. We gradually established three-level governments at the prefectural, county, and district levels, and trained more than 2,000 cadres of our own ethnic group, greatly changing the political, economic, and cultural outlook of the Guoluo area. In 1958, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and inspired by the comprehensive Great Leap Forward of all ethnic groups in the motherland, the broad masses of laboring herdsmen in the Guoluo area were in high spirits and actively demanded the implementation of the socialist transformation of the animal husbandry economy. Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of herdsmen realized democratic reform. At this time, the great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, issued the call "The people's commune is still good!" The laboring herdsmen took advantage of the socialist revolution and realized the communization of the people in the winter of 1958, ending the primitive life of nomadic grazing and realizing permanent settlement in tents.
    With the emergence of the people's commune, the Guoluo grassland entered a new historical period. According to the Party's policy of "taking animal husbandry as the main focus, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing diversified operations," the people's commune conscientiously implemented the eight measures of water, grass, management, breeding, agriculture, prevention, planting, and industry in animal husbandry production, and launched mass movements and carried out appraisals and competitions in production links such as grasping fatness, protecting fatness, mating, protecting pregnancy, lambing, and raising young animals. Last year, the proportion of first-class fatness of all kinds of livestock in the state reached more than 95%, the conception rate of breeding ewes of the right age reached 99%, and more than 70 million catties of green hay were stored, realizing that large livestock had pens and young livestock had sheds. Since January this year, sheep have begun to lamb. Commune members graze with the flocks and take turns keeping watch at night. The lamb survival rate has reached more than 96%. These are unprecedented in the history of Guoluo, laying a good foundation for the great development of livestock this year. In terms of agricultural production, thanks to the people's commune, various food crops were planted on a large area for the first time on the Guoluo grassland. In areas where crops were planted early and managed carefully, all the crops matured. The Bagou Commune in Tongde County also had a thousand-catty mu of wheat, and the highland barley that was reclaimed and sown at the same time in Jiuzhi County achieved a yield of more than 500 catties per mu. These facts of high yield greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses and strengthened their confidence in developing agricultural production. When expanding the cultivated area last winter and this spring, the laboring herdsmen overcame the difficulties of insufficient labor and inadequate tools, and in one fell swoop reclaimed more than 190,000 mu of wasteland and built more than 105,000 mu of water conservancy, striving to basically achieve self-sufficiency in grain this year.
    With the leap forward in agricultural and animal husbandry production, industries, culture, education, and health have also greatly developed. Although industry is just beginning, it has developed rapidly. Last year, the total output value exceeded the plan by more than one and a half times. Medical institutions and schools have been generally established in various communes. There are already 96 primary schools in the prefecture, with more than 7,000 children enrolled, accounting for more than 90% of the total number of school-age children, basically popularizing primary school education.
    These construction achievements are unprecedented for the Guoluo area, and they are also developing at a high speed in terms of progress. However, due to historical reasons, Guoluo is still much more backward than those economically and culturally developed areas. However, things are always changing and developing. Since liberation, especially since communization, the face of the Guoluo area has undergone significant changes. Today, although Guoluo is still very backward, we believe that this is a temporary phenomenon. We firmly believe that as long as we resolutely implement the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, spur our horses forward, it will not take long before Guoluo can change from backward to advanced and keep pace with other advanced areas. At that time, the number of livestock will increase many times over the current number, people will be cultivating large areas of fertile land with machinery, the population will also increase a lot compared to the present, and many modern factories will appear on the grassland, and the rich underground resources will be developed and utilized... These things seem distant, but the development of things often exceeds people's imagination, as the situation in the year or so after communization has shown.
    What are the conditions that will enable us to catch up with the advanced areas?
    First, the Guoluo area is vast, and various resources are extremely rich, with great potential for the development of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry. Based solely on the materials from surveys in a very small area and reports from herdsmen, there are 18 types of minerals, more than 50 mineral points, including copper, iron, lead, zinc, manganese, tungsten, gold, silver, coal, and stone, many of which have already been confirmed to be ore deposits with large reserves, high grades, and exploitable value. The prefecture has a large grassland area with good water and grass, and a large carrying capacity. Even if the number of livestock increases several or even dozens of times, there is no worry about not having a place to graze. In addition, there are millions of mu of fertile wasteland that can be reclaimed, which is very promising in agricultural production. All of these are a solid material foundation for large-scale economic construction.
    Second, the special care of the Party and the government for ethnic minority areas and backward areas, and the support of advanced areas, will promote the high-speed development of Guoluo's construction undertakings. Guoluo has a poor foundation and urgently needs external support, and also hopes that its resources can be rapidly developed and utilized to supply other areas. In recent years, under the guidance of the idea of "the whole country as a chessboard," advanced areas have given us a great deal of help. The Dawu Milk Powder Factory, which was built not long ago, was helped by the Xining Kangersu Dairy Factory in the supply of machinery and equipment and the training of Tibetan technicians. In addition, the state and province will fully take care of backward areas and ethnic minority areas in construction planning and investment. This is a guarantee for Guoluo's high-speed development.
    Third, Guoluo has more than 70,000 hardworking and courageous Tibetan people who have completely freed themselves from feudal shackles and are truly masters of their own affairs. They have great determination, high confidence, and resolute actions in building socialism. This is the fundamental driving force for the great development of production and the socialist construction of Guoluo. Our country used to be "poor and blank," and Guoluo was even poorer and blanker. Therefore, the working people's desire to change poverty and backwardness is even more urgent, and their drive to strive for the upstream is even greater. Many facts since the Great Leap Forward have fully illustrated this point. Last year, in order to overcome the cold and strive for the maturity of food crops, the herdsmen of Jiuzhi County built more than 1,800 earthen stoves in the fields and stored enough fuel, and set fires to smoke and prevent frost whenever there was frost and snow. By doing so, not only did the grain mature, but some high-yield areas also achieved an average yield of more than 530 catties per mu.
    Under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, with the incomparably superior people's commune system, with the experience of vigorously launching mass movements, and with the various favorable conditions mentioned above, we have the possibility of changing from backward to advanced in a short period of time. The more than 70,000 people of our Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture will certainly exert all our strength, strive for the upstream, spur our horses forward, and advance at high speed.

    快马加鞭赶先进
    中共果洛藏族自治州委员会第一书记　程建民
    果洛藏族自治州，对许多读者来说，可能是比较生疏的。它在青海省的东南部，面积有十四万多平方公里，境内有著名的巴颜喀喇山和积石山，黄河自西向东横贯全州。这里水草丰美，宜牧宜农，有着极为丰富的矿藏、水产、野生动物和植物资源，还有大面积的原始森林。在这块辽阔富饶的土地上，居住着七万多勤劳勇敢的藏族牧民。在解放以前的几十年间，蒋介石和马步芳匪帮对果洛人民进行了多次屠杀掠夺，部落内部的反动头人和封建牧主对劳动牧民进行残酷的压迫和剥削，民族之间和部落之间械斗连年不断，因而人口逐年减少，交通极为阻塞，牧民们长期过着原始的十分贫困的生活。
    解放后，我们根据党的民族政策进行了一系列的工作，逐步发展了生产，根除了从历史上遗留下来的民族纠纷，安定了社会秩序，增强了民族团结，并积极推行了民族区域自治，逐步建立了州、县、区三级政权，培养了两千多名本民族干部，使果洛地区的政治、经济、文化面貌有了很大的改变。1958年，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在祖国各族人民全面大跃进的形势鼓舞下，果洛地区广大劳动牧民精神焕发，积极要求实行畜牧业经济的社会主义改造。广大牧民群众在党的领导下，实现了民主改革。正在这个时候，各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席发出了“还是人民公社好”的号召，劳动牧民就乘社会主义革命之风，在1958年冬天实现了人民公社化，结束了逐水草游牧的原始生活，实现了帐房定居。
    人民公社一出现，果洛草原就进入到一个新的历史时期。根据党的“以牧为主，农牧结合，发展多种经营”的方针，人民公社在畜牧业生产上认真地贯彻了水、草、管、繁、农、防、种、工等八项措施，在抓膘、保膘、配种、保胎、接羔、育幼等生产环节中大搞群众运动，开展评比竞赛。去年，全州各类牲畜的一等膘达到95％以上，适龄母畜配种受胎率达到99％，储备青干草七千多万斤，实现了大畜有圈、幼畜有棚。今年1月以来，绵羊开始产羔，社员跟群放牧，轮流守夜，羊羔成活率达到96％以上。这些在果洛历史上都是空前的，为今年牲畜大发展打好了基础。在农业生产方面，由于有了人民公社，果洛草原上第一次大面积试种了各种粮食作物。种得早、管得细的地区，作物全部成熟。同德县巴沟公社还出现了小麦千斤亩，久治县边开荒边播种的青稞，亩产达到五百多斤，这些丰产事实大大鼓舞了群众的情绪，加强了他们对发展农业生产的信心。在去冬今春扩大耕地面积时，劳动牧民克服了劳力不足、工具不够的困难，一鼓作气开荒十九万多亩，修水利十万五千多亩，要在今年实现粮食基本自给。
    随着农牧业生产的跃进，工业、文教、卫生等事业也有很大发展。工业虽然刚刚萌芽，发展却很快，去年总产值超过计划一倍半多。各公社普遍建立了医疗机构和办了学校。全州已有小学九十六所，入学儿童七千多人，占学龄儿童总数的90％以上，基本上普及了小学教育。
    这些建设成绩，对果洛地区来说是空前的，从进度上看也是高速度发展的。然而，由于历史的原因，目前果洛比那些经济、文化比较发达的地区仍然要落后得多。但是，事情总是在变化发展着的。解放以来，特别是公社化以来，果洛地区的面貌已经起了显著的变化。今天，果洛虽然还很落后，我们认为这是一种暂时的现象。我们深信，只要我们坚决地贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，快马加鞭，一定不会要很久时间，果洛就可以由落后变为先进，与其他先进地区并驾齐驱。那时，牲畜头数将要比现在成倍地增加，人们用机械耕作着大片良田，人口也将比现在增加很多，草原上将出现许多个现代化工厂，丰富的地下资源都将被开发利用……。这些事情，想起来好像是遥远的，但事物的发展往往会超过人们的想像，公社化后一年多的情况就是这样的。
    我们一定能够赶上先进地区的条件有哪些呢？
    第一，果洛地区辽阔，各类资源极为丰富，工农牧业发展潜力极大。仅根据在极小部分地区调查和牧民报矿的材料，就发现有铜、铁、铅、锌、锰、钨、金、银、煤、石等十八个矿种，五十多个矿点，许多矿点已经肯定是储量大、品位高的具有开采价值的矿床。州内草原面积广，水草好，载畜量大，即使牲畜增加几倍、十几倍，也不愁没有地方放牧。另外，还有几百万亩可垦的肥沃荒地，在农业生产上大有可为。所有这些，都是进行大规模经济建设的雄厚的物质基础。
    第二，党和政府对民族地区和落后地区的特殊关怀，先进地区的支援，将促进果洛建设事业的高速度发展。果洛的基础差，很需要外地支援，也很希望自己的资源迅速被开发利用，供应外地。几年来，在“全国一盘棋”的思想指导下，先进地区已经给了我们很大帮助。不久以前建成的大武奶粉厂，机器设备的供应和对藏族技术工人的培养训练，都是西宁康尔素乳品厂帮助我们的。另外，在国家和省的建设布局和投资上，也会充分照顾落后地区和民族地区，这是果洛高速度发展的一个保证。
    第三，果洛有七万多勤劳勇敢的藏族人民，彻底摆脱了封建枷锁，真正当家作主，他们建设社会主义的决心大，信心高，行动坚决，这是果洛生产大发展，并进行社会主义建设的根本动力。我们的国家过去是“一穷二白”，果洛则是更穷更白，因此，劳动人民要求改变贫穷和落后面貌的心情就更为迫切，争上游的干劲就更大。大跃进以来的许多事实，都充分地说明了这一点。去年，久治县的牧民为了战胜寒冻，争取粮食作物成熟，他们在田头修建了一千八百多个土炉，储备了足够的燃料，遇有霜雪就点火熏烟防冻。这样做，不仅粮食成熟了，有的高产区还平均亩产达到五百三十多斤。
    在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，有无比优越的人民公社制度，有大搞群众运动的经验，加之有上述各种有利条件，我们就有可能在不长的时间内，由落后变为先进。我们果洛藏族自治州的七万多人民，一定鼓足干劲，力争上游，快马加鞭，高速前进。
