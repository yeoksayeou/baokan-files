Editorial: The Key to Increasing Cotton Production This Year

    In 1959, the people's communes in cotton-producing areas, under the leadership of the Party, conquered unprecedented natural disasters and achieved a continued leap forward in cotton production. Total ginned cotton production reached 48.2 million dan, an increase of 14.76% over 1958, reaching the original cotton production target for 1962 of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. The two consecutive years of leap forward in cotton production have provided rich experience and opened up a path to rapidly increase cotton production. This is to fully leverage the superiority of the people's communes, focus on large-scale high-yield cotton production, and carry out large-scale high-yield movement, thereby driving the production of general cotton fields and realizing an all-round leap forward in cotton production. Vigorously developing high-yield fields is the key to increasing cotton production this year.
    High-yield fields are the product of the people's communes and the Great Leap Forward. High-yield fields first appeared in some areas of Hebei and Henan during the Great Leap Forward in 1958; they were promoted in more areas in 1959, and the experience became more mature. Establishing high-yield fields means planting the same crop on a large area of connected land, according to natural conditions and production plans, with fields linked to fields, and plots nested within plots, forming a continuous expanse of hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of mu. Through these high-yield fields, a large amount of manpower, materials, and land are combined into a huge whole, with unified leadership, unified planning, unified formulation of measures, and unified action, to give full play to the power of large collectives and large-scale cooperation, comprehensively implement the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, fully carry out technical transformation and basic agricultural construction, and universally increase unit area yield and total output. Under the direct leadership of the Party committee of the people's commune, the high-yield fields organize specialized production teams, take various measures, carefully manage the cotton fields, and conduct mutual evaluation and competition between teams and fields. In the high-yield fields, experimental plots and central plots are also established, forming a technology transfer network and a experimental research network; Red and Expert schools are also established according to the fields, combining labor production with political study and cultural education, promoting the rapid improvement of members' political thought and scientific and technological level. High-yield fields are also an advanced position for the universal promotion of technological innovation. With good experience, on-site meetings, evaluation visits, exchange of labor, and other methods are adopted to drive the general fields to achieve increased production. Precisely because the superiority of collective farming is brought into full play, the unit area yield of cotton fields in high-yield fields is 20%, 30%, or even more than 50% higher than the yield of general cotton fields. General fields can also increase production faster under the drive of high-yield fields.
    The emergence and development of high-yield fields are inseparable from the emergence and development of people's communes. The people's communes can uniformly use manpower and materials on a wide scale, and uniformly allocate and utilize land and resources, thus making it possible to vigorously develop high-yield fields. This form of organizing large-scale high-yield movements is completely adapted to the situation of the rural Great Leap Forward after the people's communes. High-yield fields not only greatly changed the face of production, but also changed people's mental outlook. Wherever high-yield fields are vigorously developed, the land has undergone great changes, the crops have undergone great changes, and the mental outlook has undergone great changes. Advanced ideas have overcome conservative and backward ideas, and the farming habits and psychology of small-scale farming have been completely swept away. The collective and communist thinking of the members has been greatly improved.
    Delineating fields and linking plots is not only the path to leap forward and increase production in old cotton-producing areas and cotton-producing areas with consistently high yields, but also an effective method to rapidly increase yields in new cotton-producing areas and so-called "low-yield cotton areas." For example, Siyang in Jiangsu, Chaoxian in Anhui, Xinye, Fugou, and Shangcai in Henan all became high-yield counties with a per-mu yield of over 100 jin of ginned cotton in 1959. The unit area yield of cotton in these counties increased by one to four times in two years. The reason for the change from low yield to high yield is mainly to adhere to putting politics in command, strengthen leadership, muster full energy, strive for the top, vigorously improve leadership methods and farming methods, combine scattered cotton fields, and concentrate efforts to improve production conditions and improve farming techniques. In the past, cotton fields in Fugou County, Henan, were scattered and fragmented, and the average per-mu yield of ginned cotton in 1957 was only 24 jin. In 1959, the superiority of the people's commune was further brought into play, and cotton fields were universally adjusted and planted in connected plots. Half of the county's 130,000 mu of cotton fields were adjusted into nine large fields of more than 5,000 mu to about 10,000 mu, and the rest were adjusted into fields of more than 100 mu to 3,000 mu. As a result, the average cotton yield of the county jumped to 117 jin per mu, an increase of 1.6 times over 1958, equivalent to 4.9 times that of 1957. It is estimated that in 1959, "low-yield cotton fields" in the country still accounted for about one-fifth of the total cotton field area. This situation will be greatly changed in the context of this year's continued leap forward. As long as the masses are fully mobilized and advanced experience in large-scale high-yield production centered on vigorously developing high-yield fields is conscientiously promoted, the yields in these areas can be rapidly improved.
    Achieving increased cotton production this year requires further promotion and improvement of the advanced experience of cotton high-yield fields. Representatives from various regions who attended the National Cotton Leap Forward On-site Conference in late October last year proposed that in 1960, 40% of the 90 million mu of cotton fields planned to be sown nationwide should be cultivated as high-yield cotton fields, with a per-mu yield 50% higher than the local average per-mu yield. Among these high-yield fields, it is also required that the per-mu yield of a portion of the cotton fields be increased by more than 20% compared with the average per-mu yield of high-yield cotton fields. This call has been warmly responded to by the people in cotton-producing areas. In order to complete this glorious task, the people's communes should start early to vigorously develop high-yield fields, establish benchmarks for high cotton yields, and make various preparations for the high-yield cotton field movement.
    It is necessary to strengthen the Party committee's leadership over the cotton field high-yield movement. First of all, sufficient leadership and a planned organization of core teams must be allocated to the high-yield fields and high-yield plots. The original cotton high-yield movement headquarters and specialized teams must be strengthened and consolidated. Places without specialized teams should be established quickly. After the organization and leadership are consolidated and strengthened, we must quickly focus on planning and layout, delineate high-yield fields, determine central fields, and form a contact system from the central fields to the high-yield fields to the general cotton fields. Material preparation is mainly centered on soil, fertilizer, and water, with high-yield fields as the focus, and large-scale basic construction of cotton fields is carried out. Since last winter, all cotton-producing areas have launched a winter production upsurge with deep plowing, soil improvement, pig raising and fertilizer accumulation, land leveling, winter irrigation, etc. As of now, the cotton fields in the main cotton-producing areas have basically been winter-plowed, with many high-yield fields being deep-plowed more than one foot, and general deep-plowing more than seven or eight inches; the cotton fields with winter base fertilizer application have also increased greatly compared with previous years. Now, we must also seize the farming season, do a good job in spring plowing, spring irrigation, spring base fertilizer application, harrowing and protecting soil moisture, eliminating overwintering pests, carefully selecting fine varieties, repairing farm implements, and other tasks. At the same time, we must also make technical preparations, give full play to the role of the technical transfer network and experimental research network in the high-yield fields, earnestly summarize high-yield experience, carry out technical training, and further improve the technical level of core members and the broad masses.
    Vigorously developing high-yield fields is actually to use advanced ideas to replace many unreasonable habits and conservative ideas formed under backward farming conditions in the past, and to use the communist ideas of large collectives and large-scale cooperation to replace the backward and residual viewpoints of the small-scale peasant economy. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen ideological education work, and fully mobilize cadres at all levels and commune members to launch discussions. Discussions should focus on whether or not to increase cotton production at high speed, whether or not it is possible to increase cotton production at high speed, whether or not it is possible to achieve high-yield on a large scale, whether or not it is good to vigorously develop cotton high-yield fields, and why it is necessary to resolutely complete the state's cotton planting plan; it is also necessary to determine through discussions under the leadership of the Party committee: which cotton fields are suitable for being designated as high-yield fields, what the yield target for high-yield fields should be set at, what measures should be taken to ensure the realization of large-scale high-yield production, and what experience should be drawn from last year's high-yield movement. Through such discussions, it will be possible to better bring into play the wisdom and initiative of the masses, eliminate ideological obstacles, ensure that high-yield plans and increased production measures are implemented at all levels, and turn the call for striving for large-scale high-yield cotton into the conscious action of the broad masses of members.
    The situation of continuous leap forward in cotton production has already taken shape. Judging from the production upsurge that has already appeared in the vast cotton-producing areas, it is entirely possible to achieve a greater leap forward in cotton production in 1960. The mass movement led by Party committees at all levels with high-yield fields as the center and aimed at large-scale high-yield cotton production will surely become an important component of this year's agricultural production upsurge. Cadres at all levels and commune members in cotton-producing areas, actively and enthusiastically carry out a grand competition for high cotton yields. Now, the time for cotton sowing is getting closer and closer. "An inch of spring is worth an ounce of gold." In order to ensure that cotton production this year leaps to a new peak, we must seize the opportunity, conscientiously do a good job in every preparation, and tighten every link, without letting up!

    今年棉田增产的关键
    1959年，产棉区的人民公社在党的领导下征服了特大的自然灾害，实现了棉花生产的继续跃进。皮棉总产量达到四千八百二十万担，比1958年增长14．76％，提前三年达到第二个五年计划原定1962年的棉花生产指标。棉花生产的两年连续跃进，提供了丰富经验，开辟了高速度提高棉花产量的道路。这就是：充分发挥人民公社优越性，以大搞棉花丰产方为中心，开展大面积高额丰产运动，并以此带动一般棉田生产，实现棉花生产的全面跃进。大搞丰产方——这是今年棉田增产的关键。
    丰产方是人民公社和大跃进的产物。丰产方是1958年大跃进中在河北、河南一些地区首先出现的；1959年在更多地区推广，经验更加成熟。建立丰产方，就是在大面积的联成一片的土地上，按照自然条件和生产计划，种植同一种作物，方联方，方套方，数百亩、数千亩以至上万亩联成一片。通过这些丰产方，把大量的人力、物力、土地联合成一个巨大的整体，统一领导，统一规划，统一制定措施，统一采取行动，高度地发挥大集体大协作的力量，综合地贯彻执行农业八字宪法，全面地进行技术改造和农田基本建设，普遍地提高单位面积产量和总产量。丰产方在人民公社党委的直接领导下组织专业生产队，采取各种措施，精心管理棉田，并且在队与队、方与方之间互相评比、开展竞赛。在丰产方里，还建立试验田和中心方，组成技术传授网和试验研究网；还按方建立红专学校，把劳动生产和政治学习、文化教育结合起来，促进社员的政治思想和科学技术水平迅速提高。丰产方也是普遍推行技术革新的先进阵地，有了好的经验，就采取现场会议、评比参观、互换劳力等等方式，带动一般田实现增产。正因为充分发挥了集体耕作的优越性，丰产方棉田的单位面积产量，比一般棉田的产量都高20％、30％，以至50％以上。一般田在丰产方的带动下也可以较快地提高产量。
    丰产方的产生和发展，同人民公社的产生和发展是分不开的。人民公社能够在广大范围内统一运用人力和物力，统一调配和利用土地和资源，因而也就有可能大搞丰产方。这种组织大规模的丰产运动的形式，同人民公社化以后的农村大跃进的形势是完全适应的。丰产方不仅大大改变了生产面貌，同时也改变了人们的精神面貌。凡是大搞丰产方的地方，都是土地大变样，庄稼大变样，精神面貌大变样。先进的思想战胜了保守落后的思想，小农经济的耕作习惯和心理得到彻底扫除。社员们的集体主义、共产主义思想大大提高。
    划方联片，不仅在老棉区和一向产量较高的产棉区是跃进增产之路，在新棉区和所谓“低产棉区”也同样是迅速提高产量的有效方法。如江苏的泗阳、安徽的巢县、河南的新野、扶沟、上蔡等县，1959年都成为亩产皮棉百斤以上的高产县。这些县的棉花单位面积产量，两年间增长了一倍到四倍多。由低产变高产的原因，主要是坚持政治挂帅，加强领导，鼓足干劲，力争上游，大力改进领导方法和耕作方法，把零星分散的棉田并方联片，集中力量改善生产条件、改进耕作技术。河南的扶沟县，过去棉田零星分散，1957年平均亩产皮棉只有二十四斤。1959年进一步发挥人民公社的优越性，普遍调整棉田，联片种植。全县棉田十三万亩，有一半调整为五千多亩到一万亩左右的九块方，其余的也都调整为一百多亩到三千亩的方。因此，全县棉花平均产量一跃而为亩产一百一十七斤，比1958年增长一点六倍，相当于1957年的四点九倍。据估计，1959年全国“低产棉田”，仍占全部棉田面积的五分之一左右。这种情况在今年继续跃进形势下将会有较大改变。只要充分发动群众，认真推广以大搞丰产方为中心的大面积高额丰产的先进经验，这些地区的产量是完全可以迅速提高的。
    实现今年棉花增产，要求进一步推广和提高棉花丰产方的先进经验。出席去年10月下旬全国棉花跃进现场会议的各地代表，提出1960年要在全国计划播种的九千万亩棉田中，培养40％的高额丰产棉田，亩产量比当地平均亩产量要高50％。在这些高产田中，还要求有一部分棉田的亩产量比高产棉田的平均亩产量再增加20％以上。这个号召得到产棉区人民的热烈响应。为完成这个光荣的任务，人民公社应当及早动手大搞丰产方，树立棉花高产的标兵，为棉田高额丰产运动做好各种准备工作。
    必须加强党委对棉田丰产运动的领导。首先要给丰产方、丰产片配备足够的领导力量和有计划地组织基干队伍，加强和整顿原有的棉花丰产运动指挥部和专业队，没有专业队伍的地方应当迅速建立起来。组织领导整顿加强以后，就要赶快抓规划，抓布局，划定丰产方，确定中心方，并且组成从中心方到丰产方到一般棉田的联系系统。物质上的准备，主要是以土、肥、水为中心，以丰产方为重点，大兴棉田基本建设。去冬以来，各个产棉区都掀起了以深翻土地、改良土壤、养猪积肥、平整土地、冬灌等等为内容的冬季生产高潮。主要产棉区的棉田基本上全部进行了冬耕，许多丰产方深耕一尺以上，一般深耕七、八寸以上；冬施底肥的棉田也比往年大大增加。现在，还必须抓紧农时，做好春耕、春灌、春施底肥、耙耱保墒、消灭越冬害虫、精选良种、整修农具等项工作。同时，还要做好技术上的准备，充分发挥丰产方的技术传授网和试验研究网的作用，切实总结丰产经验，开展技术训练，进一步提高骨干分子和广大群众的技术水平。
    大搞丰产方，实际上是要用先进的思想来代替过去在落后耕作条件下形成的许多不合理的习惯和保守思想，是用大集体大协作的共产主义思想来代替落后的残余的小农经济观点，因此，必须加强思想教育工作，要充分发动各级干部和社员群众展开讨论。讨论要不要高速度增产棉花，能不能高速度增产棉花，能不能大面积高额丰产，大搞棉花丰产方究竟好不好，为什么要坚决完成国家的植棉计划；还要在党委领导下经过讨论确定：哪些棉田适合划为丰产方，丰产方的产量指标定为多少，采取些什么措施保证实现大面积高额丰产，从去年的丰产运动中吸取些什么经验。经过这样的讨论，就能更好地发挥群众智慧和积极性，扫除思想障碍，使丰产规划和增产措施层层落实，使争取棉花大面积高额丰产的号召变成广大社员群众自觉的行动。
    棉花生产连续跃进的形势已经形成。从广大棉区已经出现的生产高潮来看，1960年棉花生产完全有可能实现更大的跃进。各级党委领导的以丰产方为中心的棉花大面积高额丰产的群众运动，必将成为今年农业生产高潮的一个重要组成部分。产棉区各级干部和公社社员们，积极地热情地开展棉田高产的大竞赛。现在，离棉花播种时间越来越近了。“春光一刻值千金”，为了确保今年棉花生产跃进到一个新的高峰，当前必须紧紧抓住时机，切实做好每一项准备工作，任何一个环节都要扣紧，不可放松！
