Many Advantages to Centralized Feeding of Pigs in Large Troughs
Tianjin Municipal Worker-Peasant Alliance Livestock Farm

(Reported by this newspaper) The Tianjin Municipal Worker-Peasant Alliance Livestock Farm has made an overall arrangement for pigsties and pig feeding troughs. Pigsties are located around the perimeter, while the feeding troughs and feed processing room are in the center. The entire pig farm is rectangular. The pigsties are all low houses facing south, totaling twenty buildings, divided into one hundred and eighty-four rooms, with a building area of ​​2,200 square meters, capable of housing 2,500 pigs. The pigs are housed separately in various rows of pigsties according to size and strength. Each pigsty is divided into upper and lower pens, with nine to eleven pens in the upper part and a common pen in the lower part, serving as a playground for the pigs to move around. Each building has a wide aisle with a six-meter interval, facilitating the removal of manure.

The pig feeding troughs and feed processing room are also rectangular buildings, located in the center of the entire farm to make it convenient for pigs to go to the dining hall for food. The feed processing room has a cooking area in the center, with a feed warehouse 1.3 meters above the ground on the west side. The feed warehouse has a large door leading to the outside and inside, facilitating the unloading of materials from outside by trucks and supplying materials to the indoor cooking area. It is equipped with a feed grinder and slicer. The machine grinds refined and coarse feed and green fodder, and directly pours them into the cooking pot through the feeding trough set up by the wall hole, greatly shortening the handling process. There is a water well in the middle of the cooking room, equipped with an electric water pump to directly send water into the pot. The cooking room has four large pots with blowers, which can cook the materials in thirty minutes. Around the wall base near the pot table in the room, there are twelve mixing pools. The outdoor part is a cement feeding trough, brick road and drainage ditch. The feeding trough is around the outside of the wall base, with a width similar to that of a general large feeding trough. The wall above the feeding trough is equipped with movable wooden boards that communicate with the room. Before feeding, the feeders prepare indoors, pour the materials from the large pot into the mixing pool, mix them well, then hang up the movable wooden boards, take out the cooked and mixed feed with an iron spoon, pour it into the outdoor feeding trough, and then release the pigs from each row of pens in turn to the feeding trough for food.

The centralized pig feeding method with large troughs created by the Tianjin Municipal Worker-Peasant Alliance Livestock Farm has greatly improved labor productivity, making pig raising more, better, and more effortless. At the end of 1958, this farm raised 336 pigs. In the first half of 1959, it increased to 531 pigs. After centralized feeding with large troughs in the second half of the year, the number of pigs raised soared to 1,337.

Centralized feeding with large troughs is a major reform in pig raising technology. This method has attracted widespread attention from party and government leaders in many regions, and many people have come from afar to visit. Some commune members and cadres said after the visit: "With this method of feeding pigs, we can handle ten times more pigs in our commune without being too busy."

Here, we will briefly discuss some of the advantages of centralized pig feeding with large troughs compared to single-pen feeding.

First, improve work efficiency and save labor. Now, in the single-pen feeding methods in various places, the feeders are busy all day long fetching water, carrying swill, and distributing pig food to each pen and trough. When there are too many pigs, they can only take care of feeding and cannot take care of cleaning the pens, washing the troughs, and doing other chores. One person is too busy to raise thirty or dozens of pigs. In pig raising, the Worker-Peasant Alliance Livestock Farm, due to the mechanization of feed processing, only achieved eighty pigs managed per person without implementing centralized feeding with large troughs. After adopting centralized feeding with large troughs, each feeder can calmly feed 300 pigs, increasing work efficiency by more than two times. If calculated according to the general average of 30 pigs fed per person in single-pen feeding in various places, work efficiency is increased by nine times.

Second, reduce the labor intensity of feeders and improve working conditions. With single-pen pig raising, feeders have to fetch water and carry materials, which is a lot of work and tiring. Now, with centralized feeding, feeders spend most of their time in the house, evenly mixing the pig food and pouring it into the feeding trough. As long as they open the pen door, the pigs will automatically rush to the feeding trough around the wall base for food. People operate indoors, mainly cooking, mixing, and scooping materials. The room is equipped with water buckets and "local" running water, so feeders do not have to carry water and distribute pig food. Feeders have become pig cooks, greatly reducing labor intensity.

Third, it is convenient for feeders to improve pig raising techniques and achieve versatility. In the past, with single-pen feeding, feeders were busy carrying materials and feeding, and rarely had time to study and research technology, nor did they have time to observe the growth of pigs in time and further improve feeding management methods. Now that labor efficiency has increased, there is more time for learning, and they can not only learn a complete set of feeding techniques such as配料 [pèiliào] (ingredient proportioning) and cooking, but also have the conditions to learn epidemic prevention and other technologies.

Fourth, it can reduce land occupation and save infrastructure investment. In the past, with single-pen pig feeding, pigs ate and slept in the pen, occupying more land. Now, because pigs are fed centrally, pigsties are only used for pig sleeping, large pens can be set up for through-feeding, saving part of the construction area for upper and lower pens and playgrounds. The dormitories for feeding management personnel and the feed storage and cooking rooms are concentrated together, which can save a lot of construction area and funds for building buildings compared to dispersing them to various rows of pig pens during single-pen feeding.

Fifth, save feeding tools and reduce expenses. Due to centralized cooking and feeding, there is no need to cook separately, and there is no need to transport feed and carry water back and forth, which saves a large number of pots, stoves, cooking utensils, water buckets, feeding troughs and other utensils. According to the general equipment for single-pen feeding, each hundred pigs need at least one set of pots and stoves, costing one hundred yuan, one set of cooking utensils, twenty yuan, four water buckets, forty yuan, and twenty feeding troughs, one hundred and sixty yuan, totaling three hundred and twenty yuan. Two thousand five hundred pigs would need eight thousand yuan for this type of equipment. Now, with centralized feeding, 2,500 pigs only need four large pots, four sets of cooking utensils, two buckets, and eight iron spoons, totaling five hundred yuan. Four stoves burn 400 catties of coal every day, which is 70 tons a year; with single-pen feeding, one pot also needs 50 catties of coal every day, and 25 pots need a total of 1,250 catties, which requires more than 200 tons a year. By comparison, 130 tons of coal can be saved.

Sixth, save feed and avoid waste. In the past, it was easy to scatter and waste feed when dividing and feeding pigs in separate pens; now, feeding is concentrated in batches, and feed is only added to the feeding trough. Add as much as they eat, which can reduce losses. Generally, pigs are fed half a catty of mixed concentrate feed per day, and each pig reduces the loss of concentrate feed by one or two liang per day. 2,500 pigs can save 250 catties a day, and 90,000 catties of concentrate feed can be saved throughout the year, which can feed 500 pigs for a year.

Seventh, it can ensure that pigs eat well. This farm divides pigs into four major groups according to their weight (over 30 catties, over 50 catties, over 80 catties, and over 100 catties), distributed in 20 rows of pig houses in the east, west, south, and north. Within each group, they are further divided into pens according to the speed of eating and the size of the pigs. Because pigs of different sizes and strengths are divided into pens and fed in batches, the phenomenon of large pigs squeezing small pigs and strong pigs bullying weak pigs can be avoided. At the same time, the pig trough is longer, with a total length of 70 meters, which is enough to accommodate 200 pigs eating at the same time. When feeding, each pig can occupy a suitable position, and the order is orderly when eating, arranged in rows, unlike the frequent phenomenon of pigs fighting for food during single-pen feeding.

Eighth, it is convenient to accumulate fertilizer, and the pig house can be easily kept clean. In the past, pigs ate in the pen, splashing swill all over the ground, plus manure, the pen was very humid, and pigs living in this environment had more chances of getting sick, and mosquitoes and flies were easily bred in summer, which also hindered the growth and development of pigs. After centralized feeding with large troughs, pigs are trained to excrete part of their feces at the entrance of the pigsty before eating, and then excrete part of their feces outside the pen after eating, which not only facilitates the accumulation of fertilizer, but also keeps the pen dry and clean.

Ninth, it is convenient to realize mechanization. Due to the centralized storage, transportation, cooking, mixing, feeding, and management of materials, this creates extremely favorable conditions for the realization of mechanization and even electrification. The Worker-Peasant Alliance Livestock Farm has realized the electrification of large pot cooking and air blowing, and the self-flowing of water; in the future, it will also add a material transportation crane to achieve the automation of mixing and feeding, and the vaporization of cooking.

    大槽集中喂猪好处多
    天津市工农联盟畜牧场
    本报讯　天津市工农联盟畜牧场把猪圈和猪食槽作了总体安排。猪圈在四周，食槽和饲料加工间居当中。整个养猪场为长方形。猪圈都是坐北朝南的矮屋，计二十幢，隔成一百八十四间，建筑面积二千二百平方米，可容猪二千五百头，猪按大小强弱分别关在各排猪圈里。每幢猪舍分成上下圈，上圈有九至十一圈，下圈为通圈，作为运动场，以便于猪活动。每幢有间隔六米的宽走道，便于将粪便运出。
    猪食槽和饲料加工间也是长方形的建筑，设在全场当中，是为了使猪到食堂就食方便。饲料加工间室内当中是煮料间，西侧设有离地一点三米的饲料仓库，饲料库有大门通室外和室内，便于汽车自室外卸料和供给室内煮料间用料，内设有饲料粉碎机和切片机。用机器粉碎精粗饲料和青饲料，通过墙洞架设的送料槽，直接倒入煮料锅，大大缩短了搬运过程。煮料间当中设有水井一眼，安装了电力抽水泵，直接送水入锅。煮料间设有大锅四口，用吹风机，三十分钟即可将料煮熟，室内墙基四周离锅台近处设有拌料池十二个。室外的部分是洋灰做的食槽，砖道和排水沟。食槽在墙基外周围，宽窄与一般大食槽相仿。食槽上面的墙壁上装有活动木板与室内相通。喂食前，饲养员就在室内作好准备，将大锅的料倒入拌料池拌好后，然后将活动木板挂起，把煮好和调好的饲料用铁勺取出，倒在室外的食槽里，再轮流放出各排圈里的猪到食槽就食。
    天津市工农联盟畜牧场创办的大槽集中喂猪办法，大大地提高了劳动生产率，使猪养得更多更好更省力。这个场1958年年底养猪三百三十六头，1959年上半年增加到五百三十一头，下半年大槽集中喂食后，养猪头数激增到一千三百三十七头。
    大槽集中喂食是养猪技术的大改革。这种办法已经引起很多地区的党政领导部门的广泛注意，许多人不远千里来参观。一些公社的社员和干部在参观后说：“有了这种办法喂猪，咱社的猪再发展十倍也忙得过来”。
    这里我们简单地谈一谈大槽集中喂猪比单圈喂养的一些优点。
    第一，提高工效，节约劳力。现在各地的单圈喂养方式，饲养员一天到晚忙着挑水、提潲、挨圈逐槽的去分猪食，猪一多，顾得了喂食，顾不了清圈、洗槽和干别的杂活，一个人养三、几十头猪就忙不过来。工农联盟畜牧场在养猪方面，由于饲料加工实行机械化，但没有实行大槽集中喂食也只达到每人管理八十头。采用大槽集中喂食后，每个饲养员可以从容地喂三百头猪，提高工效二倍多。如果按照各地单圈饲养一般每人平均喂养三十头计算，提高工效九倍。
    第二，减轻饲养员劳动强度，改善劳动条件。单圈养猪，饲养员要挑水提料，活多也累。现在集中喂食，饲养员大半时间呆在房子里，把猪食调匀顺手倒在饲槽后，只要把圈门一开，猪就自动奔集到墙基周围饲槽就食。人在屋里操作，主要是煮料、拌料、舀料，室内设有水桶和“土”自来水，饲养员不用担水和分送猪食，饲养员变成了猪的炊事员，大大减轻劳动强度。
    第三，便于饲养员提高养猪技术，达到一专多能。过去单圈喂养，饲养员忙于挑料喂食，很少有时间学习和钻研技术，也很少有时间及时观察猪的生长状况，进一步改善饲养管理方法。现在劳动效率提高了，学习时间增多了，不仅可以学习配料、煮料等一套完整的饲养技术，而且有条件学习防疫和其他技术。
    第四，可以减少占地面积，节约基建投资。过去单圈喂猪，猪在圈内食宿，占地较多。现在由于猪集中喂食，猪圈只供猪睡眠，可设大栏通圈，节省一部分上下圈和运动场的基建面积。饲养管理人员宿舍和饲料贮藏间煮食间集中在一起，比单圈饲养时分散到各排猪栏可节省大量建筑面积和修盖建筑物的资金。
    第五，节省饲养工具，减少开支。由于集中煮食，集中喂养，不必分散煮料，更不必往返运送饲料和担水，这就节省了大批的锅灶、炊具、水桶、饲槽等等用具。按照单圈饲养一般设备，每一百头猪至少要设锅灶一套、需一百元，炊具一套、二十元，水桶四个、四十元，饲槽二十个、一百六十元，共需费用三百二十元，二千五百头猪就需这类设备费八千元。而现在集中吃食，二千五百头猪只需四口大锅，四套炊具，二副桶，铁勺八个，一共值五百元。四个灶每天烧煤四百斤，一年是七十吨；单圈养，一锅每天也得五十斤煤，二十五个锅共一千二百五十斤，一年就需二百多吨，两相比较，煤也省下一百三十多吨。
    第六，节省饲料，避免浪费。过去分圈喂猪，分送饲料容易抛撒浪费；现在分批集中喂食，只在饲槽添食，吃多少，添多少，可以减少损失。一般猪每天喂半斤混合精料，每猪每天减少损失精料一两，二千五百头猪一天就可省下二百五十斤，全年就可省下九万斤精料，可供五百头猪吃一年。
    第七，能保证猪吃好。这个场按猪体重分为四大批（三十斤以上，五十斤以上，八十斤以上，一百斤以上），分布在东、西、南、北四方的二十排猪舍内，在每方内再按吃食快慢和猪的大小分圈分开。由于大小强弱的猪分圈分批分食，可以避免大猪挤小猪和强猪欺弱猪的现象。同时猪槽较长，周围共七十米，足可容二百口猪同时吃食。喂食时每头猪都能占到适当地位，吃食时秩序井然，排列成行，不像单圈饲养时经常发生猪争食打架现象。
    第八，便于积肥，猪舍能够比较容易保持环境卫生。过去猪在圈内进食，拨的满地潲水，加上粪尿，圈内非常潮湿，猪在这种环境生活，发病机会多，而且夏季容易孳生蚊蝇，对猪的生长发育也有妨碍。大槽集中喂食后，训练猪在进食前在猪圈门口排出一部分粪便，吃食后又在圈外排出一部分粪便，这样既便于积肥，又可保持圈内的干燥清洁。
    第九，便于实现机械化。由于集中贮料、运料、煮食、拌料、喂食、管理，这就给实现机械化以至电气化创造极为有利的条件。工农联盟畜牧场已实现大锅煮食电气吹风化，用水自流化等；将来还要增设运料天车，达到拌料给食自动化、煮食蒸气化。
