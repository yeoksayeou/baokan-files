Machinery Used to Make Tofu

(Our dispatch) The Chengji Workshop of the Bean Products Processing Plant in Nanguan District, Changchun City, after six months of technical innovation, has realized mechanized production of tofu from seventeen processes, including feeding, crushing, filtering, extracting soy milk, adding brine, and producing the finished product. Furthermore, it has been assembled into an automated production line. Originally, nineteen workers produced eighty boards of tofu per day; now, the output has increased to two hundred and forty boards, increasing production efficiency by two times, with one workshop producing as much as three workshops.

In the midst of vigorously carrying out technical innovations, the workers in this workshop implemented the principle of self-reliance and making use of what was available. They used old timber and broken car belts to make a belt-type automatic feeding machine, and used the original tofu press to put together a filter... The automatic continuous production line they assembled did not require any equipment or raw materials from the state, nor did they hire a single bricklayer or carpenter.

    做豆腐用机械
    本报讯　长春市南关区豆类制品加工厂成记车间，经过六个月的技术革新，使做豆腐从投料、粉碎、过包、淘浆汁、点卤水到制成品等十七道工序实现了机械化生产，而且装成了一条自动化生产线。原来十九个工人每天生产八十板豆腐，现在增加到二百四十板，生产效率提高两倍，一个车间顶三个车间生产。
    这个车间的工人在大搞技术革新中，贯彻自力更生，因陋就简的原则。他们用旧木材、破车带制成了皮带式自动投料机，用原来的豆腐榨拼凑起来制成过滤器……他们所装配的自动连续生产线，没向国家要一件设备、一斤原料，没雇一个瓦工和木工。
