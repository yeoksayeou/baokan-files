Xinhua News Agency, Havana, February 6th. Planes from the United States carried out two more air raids against Cuba today, dropping incendiary bombs in Camagüey Province.

Thirteen million arrobas of sugarcane (one arroba equals twenty-five pounds, totaling 325 million pounds) belonging to the Adelaida Sugar Company, the Alegre Cape Sugar Company, the Violet Sugar Mill, and the Cespedes Sugar Mill were affected.

Cuban farmers, students, Red Cross workers, and rebel army soldiers have taken action, cooperating with sugar workers to extinguish the flames, salvage the burning sugarcane, and immediately transport the sugarcane to sugar mills for processing.

This newspaper reports that the Soviet "Izvestia" recently reported in an article commenting on Cuban-American relations that the campaign to slander and exert pressure on Cuba has intensified in the first few weeks of 1960.

A series of American national leaders, including Vice President Nixon, are participating in this campaign.

When discussing the reasons for launching this movement, "Izvestia" wrote that the Republic of Cuba has entered the second year of its independent development with the firm intention of carrying out the already begun revolutionary cause to the end. Land reform, which stipulates the elimination of large estates and the exclusion of foreign capital from public utilities and the sugar industry, is being successfully implemented domestically. That is where the crux of the problem lies.

"Izvestia" reminds us that U.S. monopoly capitalists have acquired the largest and best sugar crop plantations, become sugar mill owners, and seized other industrial sectors in Cuba for themselves.

Now, when the Cuban people have decided to recover the wealth of several billion dollars that was illegally plundered from them, Washington is sounding the alarm.

The article went on to point out that certain American activists, such as Congressman Hosmer, are stepping up demands for Congress to pass a resolution reviving the infamous "Monroe Doctrine," whose colonialist essence is manifested in the slogan "America for Americans," proving that the United States' goals for other Latin American countries have not changed.

### 美国飞机继续轰炸古巴  苏联“消息报”斥美国对古巴施加压力

    美国飞机继续轰炸古巴
    苏联“消息报”斥美国对古巴施加压力
    新华社哈瓦那6日电　来自美国的飞机今天又对古巴进行两次空袭，在卡马圭省投掷了燃烧弹。
    阿德拉伊达糖公司、阿莱格雷角糖公司、维奥莱特糖厂和塞斯佩德斯糖厂的一千三百万阿罗瓦甘蔗（一阿罗瓦等于二十五磅，合计达三亿二千五百万磅）受到影响。
    古巴农民、学生、红十字会和起义军士兵都行动起来，配合糖业工人扑灭火焰和抢收着火的甘蔗，并立即把甘蔗运到糖厂榨制。
    本报讯　苏联“消息报”最近在评论古巴—美国关系的文章中报道说，对古巴进行诽谤和施加压力的运动在1960年的最初几周中加剧了。
    参加这一运动的有一系列美国的国家负责人，其中包括副总统尼克松。
    “消息报”在谈到发动这一运动的原因的问题时写道，古巴共和国怀着把已经开始的革命事业进行到底的坚定意向，进入了自己独立发展的第二年。国内正在顺利地实行土地改革，这个土地改革规定消灭大地产、排除公用事业和制糖工业中的外国资本。这就是问题症结所在。
    “消息报”提醒说，要知道美国垄断资本家已经获取了最大和最好的制糖作物种植场，成为糖厂所有主，把古巴其他的工业部门攫为己有。
    现在，当古巴人民决定把这些被非法掠夺去的数约十亿美元的财富从他们手中收回时，华盛顿就敲起警钟来了。
    文章接着指出，美国某些活动家，如霍斯默议员之流，正在加紧要求在国会通过一项复活臭名昭著的“门罗主义”的决议，这个主义的殖民主义实质表现在所谓“美洲为了美国”这句口号中，这证明美国对其他拉丁美洲国家的目的未变。
