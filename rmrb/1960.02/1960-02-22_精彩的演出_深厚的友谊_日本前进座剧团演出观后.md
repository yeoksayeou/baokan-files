    Wonderful Performance, Profound Friendship
    ——After Watching the Performance of the Japanese Zenshinza Theatre Company
    Ouyang Yuqian (text), Zhang Zhengyu (sketch)

    This visit and performance by the Zenshinza Theatre Company, bringing the profound friendship of the Japanese people to the Chinese people, is a joyful event. It will play a very good role in strengthening Sino-Japanese cultural exchange and deepening mutual understanding. We express our warm welcome!

    Zenshinza is a progressive theatre company that is making unremitting efforts to inherit, promote, and innovate the excellent traditions of Japanese Kabuki, and it has achieved significant results. The four plays they brought this time, "Sakura Sogoro," "Kanjincho," "Narukami," and "Shunkan," are all representative works of Kabuki and have been somewhat adapted. Now, I would like to talk about my impressions of the two plays I saw on the first day.

    The Japanese people have a traditional moral concept of selflessness. In feudal society, this moral concept had various different contents and forms of expression. Some may have been reduced to narrow personal grievances and revenge. Sogoro in the play "Sakura Sogoro" is very valuable. He sacrificed his entire family's lives to petition on behalf of the oppressed and exploited farmers.

    About three hundred years ago, the Sakura region of Shimosa Province in Japan suffered from years of natural disasters. In addition to paying rent rice, farmers also suffered from the cruel oppression of various exorbitant taxes. Sogoro, the general representative of the farmers of twenty-nine villages in the area, led a group of farmers to ask the lord (big landlord) to reduce taxes. The lord firmly refused, even saying that they were rebelling; they had no choice but to go to the capital to appeal to the shogun. This became the crime of the common people suing an official, and Sogoro's entire family was executed.

    In the first act, "Accusation," Sogoro leads a group of farmers, kneeling in front of the lord's gate, requesting a reduction in rent. The lord's servants are armed and on guard as if facing a formidable enemy. Finally, the gate opens, and the lord comes out, scolds them severely, closes the gate, and goes inside. The farmers are extremely agitated. Sogoro advises everyone to go back for the time being, and he is determined to file a complaint. The plot is that simple, but the scene is extraordinarily vivid. During the petition, some farmers rush forward to speak; some are so angry that they can't bear it, but they barely restrain themselves; some are so painful that they can't speak; some lower their heads and sob. They are so sincere, so distressed, so indignant, but without shouting loudly. It seems that they are desperate. Sogoro, the leader, comforts the masses on the one hand, and expresses his determination on the other. Finally, he stands alone at the front of the stage, motionless for a long time, without saying a word. The audience fully understands what he is thinking. Everyone watching the play realizes Sogoro's situation and feels the seriousness of the situation, that is to say, they are attracted by the play.

    Second act: Sogoro knows that he will be beheaded if the appeal is unsuccessful, and wants to go home to take a look before going to the capital; he wants to give his wife a letter of divorce that he has written in advance to avoid implicating her. However, the lord has blocked all the boats, and he cannot cross the river. He goes to the ferry and meets an old ferryman who helps him kill the lord's lackey and cut the iron lock, and braves the heavy snow to take him across the river on a dark night. This is a righteous act.

    At the beginning of this scene, a snowy night, a small thatched hut at the ferry, inside, the old boatman is sitting facing the audience, silently warming himself by the fire. Two or three of the lord's servants and lackeys come to check the boats, lock them, and leave. The old boatman recites the story of Sogoro's petition, and then he goes to sleep. Sogoro enters from the "hanamichi" (raised platform). With a heavy heart, he looks back, step by step, lightly and quietly, to the door of the small thatched hut and knocks on the door. The old boatman gets up and opens the door, startled; he hurriedly covers the fire, but it takes him a long time to remember to close the door. They sit facing each other and talk; not many words, slow tone, very low voice, but you can see their hearts are beating, their blood is boiling. Sogoro takes out a letter of divorce from his arms and entrusts the old boatman to bring it to his wife, and gets up to leave. The old boatman grabs him, picks up a small axe, and is determined to cut the boat lock.... Cold weather, deathly still night, tense atmosphere, a broken thatched hut, two fiery hearts. In this way, the audience cannot but resonate with them. Neither Sogoro nor the old boatman has any passionate performance, but they feel that they should do that and are determined to do it. It is not chest-thumping, but deeply moving.

    The third act is in Sogoro's home. At the beginning, his eldest son is learning to write, the second son is playing with toys, and there is also an infant in swaddling clothes. Two neighboring women come to ask his wife, Ashan, for old clothes, and Ashan turns out two pieces of clothing from her wedding and gives them to them. At a glance, the audience feels that she is a virtuous wife. This introduction is very concise. Sogoro returns home, breaking the family's tranquility. Ashan does not accept the letter of divorce. She says: "Even if I am beheaded, I am your wife, let me follow you forever." After making some arrangements, Sogoro leaves home and goes to the capital to appeal. The scene of the husband and wife parting is very painful, but there is not the slightest bit of dragged-out performance. Sogoro hurriedly puts on the cloth socks that were roasting on the stove, puts on his straw sandals and ties the laces, and Ashan drapes a cloak over him; he is so calm at the critical moment of life and death, which makes him even more brave and strong. The skillful and accurate, sincere and natural movements make the audience forget that they are watching a play. When leaving, the two children grab their father's clothes and refuse to let go; Sogoro opens his arms and hugs them, and several poses show deep and high emotions, full of emotion, just right. The eldest son chases after his father barefoot in the snow, and Sogoro hugs him several times and pushes him away several times, crosses the fence and walks away, his figure is very beautiful. The two children also perform well. Ashan holds the infant, with tears in her eyes, staring blankly at her husband from the window, this place uses the rotating stage very well. The rotating stage was originally invented by Japanese Kabuki artists; using the rotating stage and the "hanamichi" are one of the significant characteristics of Kabuki.

    Sogoro takes advantage of the shogun's patrol to stop him and accuse him, resulting in his entire family being killed. In the fourth act, the execution ground, many farmers want to offer sacrifices, but are blocked at the front of the stage, and the roar of the crowd, starting from the back of the auditorium, is also quite characteristic. Before the execution, as usual, the prisoner's eyes are covered, but Sogoro says: "Don't cover Sogoro's eyes, but you can't cover the eyes of the masses." After Sogoro's death, his story has been circulating among the broad masses of the Japanese people. This play was originally written by Segawa Joko, and is the first play in Kabuki to reflect the struggle of farmers; it has now been adapted by Hirata Kenzo, the literary minister of the Zenshinza, presenting a new look.

    Nakamura Kanjakuemon plays Sogoro very well; Kawarasaki Kunitaro plays Ashan, Bando Choyemon plays the old boatman Jinbei, and they all perform very well. From some of the impressions I have said above, you can imagine that the cleverness of their acting skills lies in not being arrogant or arrogant, seemingly relying purely on nature everywhere, but showing deep skill everywhere. The physical movements are unusually refined, carefully selected, neither excessive nor insufficient, and appropriately convey deep inner feelings. The structure of the whole play is also very concise and clear, all of which are worth learning well.

    "Kanjincho" is one of the Kabuki Eighteen Best Plays, and it is a long-circulating and well-known repertoire in Japan. Benkei is a symbol of warriors. Mentioning Benkei is like mentioning Guan Yu. We always feel that he is loyal, brave, and full of wit. This play describes how Minamoto Yoritomo wanted to kill his brother Yoshitsune, who had helped him conquer the world. Benkei protects Yoshitsune and escapes from danger. When he is about to pass the barrier, he is interrogated by Togashi, the guard, who asks him what he is doing out of the barrier? He says that the emperor wants him to solicit donations to build a temple in memory of his deceased beloved concubine. He takes out a scroll of documents, pretends to be a donation register, and recites a passage about the origin of the donation on the spot, covering up Yoshitsune's passage through the barrier. Unexpectedly, Yoshitsune, disguised as a porter, is recognized. He takes the carrying pole and hits Yoshitsune, scolding: All the way, because you look like Yoshitsune, you have delayed me so much. In this way, he passed the barrier. In fact, Togashi was moved by Benkei's loyalty, courage and wisdom, and intentionally let him pass.

    This play is very difficult to perform. An actor playing Benkei must have many conditions. Whether looking at Choajuro from his figure, physique, appearance, or voice, he could not be better. In addition, his performing arts, including dance, lines, and movements and expressions, are all exquisite and can be called perfect. Benkei's task is to protect Yoshitsune through the barrier, and his every word and deed, whether recitation or dance, cannot be separated from this main purpose. His loyalty, courage, and wisdom must be naturally revealed through his movements and language. This requires a high degree of artistic cultivation and technical training, and this is also the advantage of Choajuro playing Benkei.

    With a good Benkei, there must be an equally matched Togashi, and Kanjakuemon playing Togashi could not be better. He has put a lot of effort into his performing arts, and his recitation and use of breath are unique, so standing on the same stage with Choajuro becomes a wonderful ensemble. Arashi Sanzaburo playing Yoshitsune in this play is also very famous, a gorgeous and handsome nobleman, even in adversity, still does not lose his demeanor, which is rare. In addition, all the retainers and soldiers are extremely neat. Such a "Kanjincho" is truly a perfect match.

    Kabuki pays the most attention to lines, such as Benkei's recitation of the origin of the donation, and the dialogue between Togashi and Benkei. As long as the wording is slightly different, or the tone is slightly different, it will not be possible to recite it. Choajuro and Kanjakuemon's lines have really been tempered thousands of times, and they have put in countless efforts. What "Kanjincho" recites is pure rhyme white, and the lines of "Sakura Sogoro" are closer to spoken language; there are different ways of reciting, but although the voice is very light, every word is clear, and the effort put in is no less than "Kanjincho". This is also worth our special attention and good study. (Attached picture)

    精彩的演出　深厚的友谊
    ——日本前进座剧团演出观后
    欧阳予倩文　张正宇速写
    这次前进座剧团带着日本人民对中国人民深厚的友谊，来我国作访问演出，是一件可喜的大事；对加强中日文化交流，加深彼此间的了解，将起很好的作用，我们表示热烈的欢迎！
    前进座是个进步的剧团，对日本歌舞伎优良传统的继承、发扬和革新，进行着不懈的努力，有显著的成绩。这次带来的“佐仓宗五郎”、“劝进帐”、“鸣神”、“俊宽”等四个戏，都是歌舞伎的代表作并且经过一些整理的。现在想就头一天所看的两个戏来谈一谈我的观感。
    日本人民有舍己为人的传统道德观念。在封建社会里，这种道德观念有各种不同的内容和表现形式。有的可能流于狭隘的个人恩怨报复。像“佐仓宗五郎”这出戏里的宗五郎那样是很可贵的。他为了替被压迫、被剥削的农民请愿而牺牲了全家的生命。
    去今约三百多年前，日本下总国佐仓地方连年遭受灾荒，农民除缴纳租谷外，还要受种种苛捐杂税的残酷压榨。当地二十九个村子农民的总代表宗五郎，带着一群农民向领主（大地主）请求减轻租税。领主坚决拒绝，还说他们造反；不得已只得上京向将军控诉，这样一来就成为百姓告官的罪名，将宗五郎全家处死。
    第一幕告状，宗五郎领着一群农民，跪倒在领主的大门前，请求减租，领主的家丁们武装警戒如临大敌，最后大门打开，领主走出来，痛骂一顿，关上门进去了。农民们奋激达于极点，宗五郎劝大家暂时回去，他决心去告上状。情节就这么简单，场面却异常生动。在请愿的时候，农民们有的抢上去讲话；有的是愤怒到忍无可忍，又勉强抑制下来；有的痛苦得说不出话来；有的低头啜泣。他们是那样真切，那样沉痛，那样愤慨，可是没有高声吵闹。看来是绝望了。领头的宗五郎，一方面安慰群众，一方面表示决心，最后他一个人站在台口，半晌不动，也不说话，他心里在想什么观众完全明白。每一个看戏的人都意识到宗五郎的处境而感觉事态严重，也就是说被戏吸引住了。
    第二幕：宗五郎知道上诉不成要杀头，想在上京之前回家去看一看；想将他预先写好的一封休书给他妻子，以免连累。可是领主把船都封锁了，不能过河。他走到渡口遇见一位驾渡船的老人，帮他打死了领主的狗腿子，砍断铁锁，在一个大风雪的深夜里，冒死把他送过了河。这是一个义举。
    这幕戏一开场，雪夜，渡口的一间小草房，里面老船夫正对观众坐着，一声不响在烤火。外面领主的家丁和狗腿子两三人来检查船只，上锁后走了。老船夫念道着宗五郎请愿的事，然后他睡下。宗五郎从“花道”上场。他带着沉重的心情，回顾一下后面，一步一步轻轻悄悄地捱到小草房门口扣门。老船夫起身开门，大惊；急忙把火盖上，可是半晌才想起把门关上。他们对坐倾谈；话不多，语调缓慢，声音很低，可是看得出他们的心在跳，血在沸腾。宗五郎从怀里取出一封休书托老船夫带给他的妻子，起身便走。老船夫拉住他，拿起小斧子，决心砍断船锁……。严寒的天，死静的夜，紧张的气氛，一间破草房，两颗火热的心。就这样使观众不能不和他们起共鸣。宗五郎和老船夫都没有甚么激昂慷慨的表演，不过觉得自己应当那样做便下决心那样做了。并不是捶胸顿足，而感人至深。
    第三幕是宗五郎的家里。开场他的大儿子在学写字，二儿子在弄玩具，还有乳儿在襁褓之中。两个邻居的妇人来向他的妻子阿珊讨旧衣，阿珊翻出两件嫁时的衣来给了她们。一眼看去观众便觉得她是个贤良的妻子。这样的介绍很简洁。宗五郎回家，打破了一家的宁静。阿珊不接受休书。她说：“就是杀头，我也是你的妻子，让我永远跟着你走下去。”宗五郎作了一番安排之后，离家上京告状去了。夫妻分别一场十分沉痛，可是没有丝毫拖泥带水的表演。宗五郎匆忙把烤在火炉上的布袜子穿上，穿好草鞋系上带子，阿珊替他披上斗篷；生死关头还那么镇静，也就更显得勇敢坚强。动作的熟练准确，真切自然，使观众忘了是在看戏。走时，两个孩子拉住父亲的衣裳不放；宗五郎张开两臂抱住他们，几个亮相显示出深厚而高昂的情感，情绪饱满，恰到好处。大儿子光着脚冒雪追赶父亲，宗五郎把他几度抱住几度推开，跨过篱笆走去，身段很漂亮。两个小孩子也演得好。阿珊抱着幼儿，含着眼泪，从窗户里呆呆地望着丈夫，这个地方转台用得非常好。转台本来是日本歌舞伎的艺人发明的；用转台和花道是歌舞伎显著的特点之一。
    宗五郎趁将军出巡拦与告状，以致全家被杀。第四幕法场，许多农民要去祭奠，被挡住在台口，群众的吼声，从观众席的后面出发，也颇有特点。行刑前照例要把犯人的眼睛蒙住，宗五郎却说：“不要你们蒙得住宗五郎的眼睛，却蒙不住大众的眼睛。”宗五郎死后，他的故事一直流传在日本广大人民群众当中。这个戏原本是濑川如皋写的，是歌舞伎里反映农民斗争的第一个戏；现经前进座的文艺部长平田兼三改编，呈现着新的面貌。
    中村翫右卫门演宗五郎，非常好；河原崎国太郎演阿珊，坂东调右卫门演老船夫甚兵卫，都演得很好。从我上面所说的一些印象，可以想见，他们演技的高明之处就在于不矜才不使气，处处似乎是纯任自然，而处处显出深厚的工力。形体动作异常洗练，选择得很谨严，无过无不及，恰如其分地传达出内心深刻的感情。整个戏结构也很简练而明快，这都是值得好好地学习的。
    “劝进帐”是歌舞伎十八番之一，在日本是流传很久、家喻户晓的保留节目。弁庆是勇士的象征，提到弁庆就好像我们提到关羽一样，总觉得他是忠勇过人而富于机智。这个剧是描写源赖朝要想杀掉曾经帮助过他打天下的兄弟义经，弁庆保护义经逃出虎口，当要过关的时候，为守关的富樫所盘诘，问他出关干什么？他说皇帝为着纪念死去的爱妃，要他化缘建庙。他取出一轴文书，假作缘簿，当场念出一段募化的缘起，掩护义经过关。不料假扮挑夫的义经又被认出，他拿过扁担打义经，骂道：一路之上就因为你长得像义经，耽误了我多少事。这样便过了关。实际是富樫为弁庆的忠勇智慧所感动，有意放他过关的。
    这个戏是非常难演的戏。演弁庆的要具备许多条件，长十郎无论是从他的身材、体格、扮相、嗓音看，都是再好没有的。加之他的表演艺术，包括舞蹈、台词、以及动作表情无不精妙，可称全璧。弁庆的任务是要保护义经过关，他的一言一动，不管是朗诵也好，舞蹈也好，不能离开这一主要目的。他的忠勇和智慧必须通过他的动作、语言自然流露。这需要有高度的艺术修养和技术锻炼，长十郎演弁庆的优点也就在此。
    有了好的弁庆必须有铢两悉称的富樫，翫右卫门演富樫是再好没有的。他在表演艺术上下了很深的工夫，念白吐字和用气有独到之处，所以和长十郎同台站在一处，就成为美妙的合奏。这个戏岚芳三郎演义经也是非常有名的，一个华美英俊的贵公子，虽在患难之中，还不失他的气度，实为难得。此外所有的家臣兵士都极为整齐。这样的“劝进帐”真是珠联璧合完美无缺的。
    歌舞伎最注重道白，像弁庆的念缘起，富樫和弁庆两人的对白，只要字眼差一点，气口差一点就会念不下来。长十郎和翫右卫门的台词真是经过千锤百炼，下过不知多少工夫。“劝进帐”所念的是纯韵白，“佐仓宗五郎”的台词，比较接近口语；有不同的念法，可是尽管声音很轻，个个字都清楚，所下的功夫并不少于“劝进帐”。这也是值得我们特别注意，好好的学习的。（附图片）
