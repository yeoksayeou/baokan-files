My sister and I Visit the Reservoir
	Gan Heyun

I had already seen the news about the completion of the Shaoshan Youth Reservoir in the newspaper while I was still at school. At that time, how much I longed to go home and see it.

Now we are going to see the reservoir. We walked and walked, and ahead we arrived at Maqi'ao. The reservoir is over there. I was very familiar with Maqi'ao. My youthful footprints of collecting firewood and grazing cattle were all over the mountain. But today I was disoriented, the winding sheep trails were gone, and a wide road climbed to the top of the mountain.

Over Maqi'ao. Ah! What was unfolding before my eyes was a vast world of white water. I could no longer see the mountain streams in my memory, the barren slopes piled with ancient tombs, and the simple farmhouses nestled at the foot of the mountains. Looking at the green and clear lake water and the surging waves crashing against the rocks, I felt a little daunted in my heart. I asked my sister, "Are you afraid looking at such big waves?" My sister threw her two long braids back and said, "What's there to be afraid of?" My sister has always been timid, but now my third brother tells me that she can go to meetings alone at night. She has said to me more than once, "Sister, I am even happier than you. You are seven or eight years older than me, but you haven't seen Chairman Mao yet, but I have." Obviously, the fact that my sister shook hands with Chairman Mao at the Shaoshan School has been deeply engraved in her young heart and has become an infinite source of strength to her.

My sister led me along the winding mountain road towards the lake dam. A dam built of rocks and concrete blocked the exit of this mountain ravine, just like a wall cutting off a river. The surface of the dam is more than fifty meters wide and two hundred meters high. It is not difficult to see that the main project of this reservoir is this dam. My sister said, "It was so lively when the reservoir was being built. During the day, people were like the sea, and at night it was a city that never sleeps. Thousands of migrant workers ate and slept here. The commune members all wanted to do one more thing for the reservoir, contribute one more effort, and even the young six- or seven-year-old students in our school each brought a kiln brick for the reservoir." I asked my sister, "Did you come too?" She said, "Of course. Why wouldn't we in the higher grades come? Our sixth grade worked here for eight days." I said, "That's a big contribution!" My sister smiled, but immediately said, "We are too weak and only do light work."

Standing tall, seeing far. Standing on the dam, I looked out and saw that the winter rice growing luxuriantly in the vast fields in the dam's curve. The green rice seedlings rose and fell with the autumn wind, raising layers of ripples. Many male and female commune members were weeding and applying fertilizer in the fields. The rushing lake water flowed along the canals from the sluice gates to the winter rice fields. Looking at this scene of a promising harvest, I couldn't help but think of the past. In 1946, it didn't rain for fifty consecutive days, and it was so dry here that there was no water to drink. The peasants organized more than thirty waterwheels and wheeled for sixteen consecutive days, drying up a small stream two li long. As a result, the effort was futile, and thousands of acres of rice fields yielded nothing. But the landlords still forced the tenants to pay rent, causing many peasants to become displaced, their families scattered, begging for food and fleeing famine. In the past, it was: "Three days without rain, waterwheels turn, half a month without rain, fields crack, farming in the dam's curve, nine out of ten years a drought disaster." Now that this reservoir has been built, even though it didn't rain for eighty-two consecutive days last year, not a single waterwheel was used in the dam's curve, "The Dragon King could only stare blankly, and the drought demon went to the ninth heaven." The lake water poured into the rice fields endlessly, resulting in a great harvest despite the great drought!

This reservoir is located in a place called Hudijie (Lake Dam Border). This used to be the boundary between two townships, one belonging to Shaoshan and the other to Qingxi. If it weren't for the communization breaking down the boundaries of townships and communes, if it weren't for the large size of the communes, the large labor force, and the ability to mobilize resources in a unified way, it would be unimaginable to build such a large reservoir! Without communization, without the Great Leap Forward, could such a reservoir be built in two or three months?

My sister told me that the completion of this reservoir not only brought significant benefits to the irrigation of the fields, but also the hundreds of thousands of fish raised in the lake are already two or three jin each. My sister also said that they are preparing to build the second hydropower station in Shaoshan. Soon, bright electric lights will be turned on in every commune member's home.

The sun was setting in the west, and the work songs of the commune members came from the fields... I was immersed in this happy atmosphere. The evening breeze swept across the lake, bringing a deep chill. My sister put the thermal underwear that my mother had given her to bring on my shoulders. I glanced at this new dark blue thermal underwear and said to my sister, "I'm not used to wearing such an open-front thermal underwear." My sister shook her shiny black braids again: "You still say you're not used to it, this was awarded to Dad by the commune canteen when he became a model administrator!"

I took out my diary to write something, but I couldn't write anything. I only felt that I had a thousand words in my heart, so I ended up writing this sentence: "The People's Commune is good!"

### 我和妹妹看水库

    我和妹妹看水库
    甘鹤云
    韶山青年水库修成的消息，我早在学校时，就从报纸上看到了。当时我就多么盼望能回家看看呵。
    现在我们就去看水库了。走着，走着，前面就到了马骑坳，水库就在坳那边。马骑坳这地方我本来很熟悉，山塞上有过我少年时打柴放牛的足迹。但今天却把我弄得不知方向，迂回的羊肠小道不见了，宽敞的马路爬上了山顶。
    翻过马骑坳。啊！展现在我眼前的，是一片白茫茫的水的世界，再见不到我记忆中的那群山中的涧溪，那古坟堆砌的荒坪，和那座落山边的简陋的农舍了。我望着那绿澄澄的湖水，那冲击山岩的澎湃的波涛，心里仿佛有些胆寒，我问妹妹：“这样大的浪子，你望着怕吗？”妹妹将两个长辫子往后一甩，说：“这怕什么？”妹妹一向胆子很小，现在三弟告诉我，她能一个人在夜里去开会了。她不止一次地对我说：“姐姐，我比你还幸福。你比我大七八岁，可是你还未见到过毛主席，我却见到了。”显然，妹妹在韶山学校和毛主席握了手这件事，已经铭刻在她幼小心灵的深处，已成为鼓舞她的无限的力量。
    妹妹引着我沿着盘旋的山路，走向湖堤。一道用岩石和混凝土建筑起来的堤坝，堵住了这个山冲的出口，犹如一道墙横腰斩断了一条江河一样。湖堤的堤面有五十多米宽，高达两百米。不难看出，这个水库的主要工程就是这道堤。妹妹说：“修水库时真热闹，白天人成海，夜里是个不夜城，几千民工吃在这里，睡在这里。社员们个个都想为水库多做一件事，多出一把力，连我们学校低年级六七岁的小同学，也每个人为水库送来了一口窑砖。”我问妹妹：“那你也来了吗？”她说：“当然嘛。我们高年级还不来？我们六年级在这里劳动了八天。”我说：“那贡献不小呀！”妹妹笑了，但立刻又说：“我们力气太小了，干的都是轻松活。”
    站得高，望得远。我站在堤岸上眺望着，看到堤下坝弯里那广阔的田野上，冬籼子长得正繁茂，绿油油的禾苗随着秋风一起一伏，扬起一层层的波纹。许多男女社员正在田地里除草、追肥。哗哗的湖水从水闸沿着渠道，一直流到那些冬籼子田里，看着这丰收在望的景象，我不由得想起了过去。1946年，一连五十天没有下雨，这里干得连吃水也没有了。农民们组织了三十多部水车，一连车了十六天，把一条长达两华里的小溪给车干了。结果不欢而散，上千亩稻田颗粒无收。但地主仍然逼着佃户交租，使得许多农民流离失所，妻离子散，讨饭逃荒。过去这里就是：“三天无雨下车车，半月无雨田开坼，作田莫到坝弯里，十有九年旱成灾。”现在修起了这座水库，尽管去年一连八十二天没有下雨，但坝弯里没有下一梯水车，“龙王只得白瞪眼，旱魔上了九重天”，湖水滔滔不绝涌稻田，结果是大旱大丰收！
    这水库座落的地方叫湖堤界。这里原是两个乡的交界，一边属韶山，一边属清溪。要不是公社化打破乡界社界，要不是公社大、劳力多并且能统一调动，想建筑这样大的水库，是多么难以想像的事啊！没有公社化，没有大跃进，能在两三个月的时间内建成一个这样的水库吗？
    妹妹告诉我，这水库的建成，不仅给田地灌溉带来了显著的利益，而且湖里养的几十万尾鱼也已经有两三斤一条了。妹妹还说，这里正在筹备建立韶山第二个水电站，不久，明亮的电灯光将在每户社员家里亮开来。
    夕阳西下，田野上传来了社员们收工的山歌……我沉醉在这幸福的气氛里。晚风掠过湖面，带来了深深的凉意，妹妹将妈妈交给她带来的卫生衣披上我的肩。我略略打量了一下这件湛蓝色的新卫生衣，对妹妹说：“我穿这样的开襟卫生衣很不习惯。”妹妹又甩了甩她那乌亮亮的长辫子：“你还说不习惯，这还是爸爸当上了模范事务长，公社食堂奖给他的哩！”
    我拿出日记本来，想记上点东西，却什么也写不出来。只觉得心里有千言万语，结果就写上这么一句：“人民公社好！”
