Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: Prominent figures from the capital's cultural circles held a gathering, warmly supporting the Ministry of Culture's serious warning and statement regarding the U.S. government's conspiracy to plunder a large number of precious cultural relics in Taiwan, and strongly protesting the despicable conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to loot China's precious cultural relics in Taiwan. The meeting unanimously passed a letter of protest against the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to plunder China's precious cultural relics in Taiwan.

More than 100 people attended the meeting, including Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, Zhang Xiruo, Qi Yanming, Tao Menghe, Chen Yuan, and Jian Bozan.

The meeting was presided over by Hu Yuzhi. The person in charge of the Ministry of Culture read out the Ministry of Culture's serious warning and statement to the U.S. government at the meeting. Wang Yeqiu, Director of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage, exposed the crimes of the United States in repeatedly conspiring to plunder cultural relics in Taiwan. Scholars, experts, and artists present at the meeting all angrily condemned and exposed that U.S. imperialism, under the guise of "peace," is not only intensifying its military, political, and economic aggression around the world, but also frantically promoting its cultural aggression policy. They pointed out that now, while the United States is stepping up its conspiracy to create "two Chinas" and constantly carrying out military provocations in the Taiwan region, it has openly dispatched the U.S. State Department to, under the pretext of "exhibition," and preparing to send warships to loot China's cultural relics in Taiwan, so that the ancestral cultural treasures in Taiwan are facing a catastrophe. This has once again exposed the thieving face of U.S. imperialism in front of the Chinese people and the people of the world. They seriously warned U.S. imperialism that it must immediately stop all conspiratorial activities to plunder China's cultural relics in Taiwan, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan must immediately rein in at the brink of the precipice and stop the infamous crime of illegally selling national cultural relics.

Prominent figures in the capital's cultural circles also called on Taiwanese compatriots and patriotic individuals to participate in the patriotic and just struggle to protect the cultural heritage of the motherland, resolutely stop the United States from colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek clique to illegally loot and transport China's cultural relics, and prevent these precious cultural relics from leaving Taiwan and being transported to the United States.

Xu Guangping, member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said at the meeting that the cultural relics in Taiwan are China's precious cultural heritage of thousands of years. No matter what name the U.S. imperialism conspires to plunder, it is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people. We lodge a serious protest against this cultural aggression by U.S. imperialism.

Zhang Xiruo, Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, said that the U.S. imperialism's plundering and fraud spares even its so-called "allies." He cited the example that during World War II, France once sent a batch of Louvre Palace treasures to the United States for safekeeping, but after the war, the United States actually used rogue means to try to take them for itself. The jackal nature of U.S. imperialism is evident. He emphasized that any contract signed between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique to steal and sell China's cultural relics is morally and legally invalid.

Tao Menghe, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, exposed the unbridled plunder and destruction of China's cultural relics by U.S. imperialists for decades. He said, "We must never allow U.S. imperialists to loot these cultural relics away from our country's territory."

Historian Jian Bozan said that U.S. imperialism has always harbored the ambition to plunder the world. This looting behavior once again shows the world that U.S. imperialism is an out-and-out robber. We want to declare to the world that Taiwan is the territory of the People's Republic of China, and these cultural relics and every plant and tree on the land of Taiwan belong to the People's Republic of China. U.S. imperialism has no right to loot them, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique has no right to sell them.

Xu Bingchang, researcher at the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, denounced the U.S.'s robbing, stealing, and deceiving behavior everywhere. He emphasized that the "Peking Man" skull was originally deposited by the Chinese side at Peking Union Medical College in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, but when the Pacific War broke out, the United States took the "Peking Man" skull from Peking Union Medical College and has not returned it to our country to this day.

Archaeologist Guo Baojun, who participated in previous Anyang excavations, said that the cultural relics in Taiwan are not only the crystallization of the wisdom of the Chinese working people, but also the result of the hard work of Chinese archaeological staff. They must not be arbitrarily plundered by U.S. imperialists. He called on people in Taiwan with national self-esteem and patriotism to rise up and resist, and work with the people of the whole country to save these cultural relics.

Historian Gu Jiegang said that the U.S. imperialism's plunder of China's cultural heritage is shocking. For example, Harvard University in the United States used to steal more than a dozen boxes of Chinese cultural relics and treasures every month through Yenching University before liberation, and it lasted for more than ten years. He said that China in the 1960s is no longer China in the 19th century. We will never allow U.S. imperialism to arbitrarily plunder China's cultural relics. We must fight to the end under the leadership of the People's Government and recover all the looted Chinese cultural treasures.

Sculptor Liu Kaiqu pointed out that the Chinese artworks that the United States is currently conspiring to plunder and has looted and destroyed in the past are all priceless treasures of the country, and are of extreme importance for us to inherit and carry forward the excellent cultural and artistic heritage of the motherland. He said, "The U.S.'s looting this time completely exposed the evil fact that U.S. imperialism is stepping up its military, political, economic and even cultural aggression against our country under the guise of peace. We art workers firmly oppose the plundering behavior of the U.S. aggressive clique."

Tang Lan, researcher at the Palace Museum, accused U.S. imperialism of its dirty behavior of plundering the cultural heritage of others everywhere. He said that we demand that the personnel of the Palace Museum and Nanjing Museum who were forced to go to Taiwan and other cultural relic workers in Taiwan strive to prevent these cultural relics from falling into the hands of the United States.

Chen Wenbin, deputy researcher of the Chinese Writing Reform Committee and a Taiwanese person in Beijing, said that we are very indignant at the crime of the United States plotting to plunder our country's ancient relics in Taiwan. Our nine million Taiwanese people, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely oppose the United States' occupation of Taiwan and resolutely oppose the United States' plundering of our country's ancient relics in Taiwan.

Chang Shuhong, Han Shuxuan, Shen Congwen, Zhao Wanli, Deng Yizhe, Shan Shiyuan, and others spoke at the meeting, strongly condemning the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism in stealing China's cultural relics.

    首都文化界著名人士集会拥护文化部声明
    强烈抗议美帝国主义的强盗行径
    呼吁台湾同胞和爱国人士参加爱国正义斗争制止把珍贵文物劫运美国
    新华社22日讯　首都文化界著名人士举行集会，热烈拥护文化部对美国政府阴谋劫夺我国在台湾的大批珍贵文物提出严重警告和声明，强烈抗议美帝国主义劫夺我国在台湾的珍贵文物的卑鄙阴谋。会议一致通过对美帝国主义阴谋劫夺我国在台湾珍贵文物的抗议书。
    出席会议的有黄炎培、陈叔通、张奚若、齐燕铭、陶孟和、陈垣、翦伯赞等一百多人。
    会议由胡愈之主持。文化部负责人在会上宣读了文化部对美国政府的严重警告和声明。文化部文物局局长王冶秋揭露美国历次阴谋劫夺我在台文物的罪行。到会的学者、专家和艺术家都愤怒地谴责和揭露美帝国主义在“和平”伪装的掩盖下，在全世界范围内，不仅加紧进行军事、政治、经济的侵略活动，而且还在疯狂地推行它的文化侵略政策。他们指出，现在，美国在加紧推行制造“两个中国”阴谋和不断在台湾地区进行军事挑衅活动的同时，竟然公开由美国国务院出面，假借“展览”为名，并准备派遣军舰劫夺我国在台文物，使在台湾的祖国文化瑰宝面临浩劫的厄运，这就再一次在中国人民和全世界人民面前，暴露了美帝国主义的强盗面目。他们严重警告美帝国主义，必须立刻停止劫夺我国在台文物的一切阴谋活动，台湾蒋介石集团必须立刻悬崖勒马，停止非法盗卖国家文物的遗臭万年的罪行。
    首都文化界著名人士并呼吁台湾同胞和爱国人士参加保护祖国文化遗产的爱国正义斗争，坚决制止美国勾结蒋介石集团非法劫运我国文物，不准这些珍贵文物离台运美。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员许广平在会上说，在台湾的文物是我国几千年的珍贵文化遗产。美帝国主义不论以任何名义阴谋劫夺，都是中国人民所绝对不能容许的。我们对美帝国主义这种文化侵略提出严重抗议。
    对外文化联络委员会主任张奚若说，美帝国主义的掳掠诈骗连它的所谓“盟友”也不能幸免。他举例说，二次大战期间，法国曾经把一批卢夫宫的珍藏送到美国去保存，但是在大战结束后，美国竟然施展无赖手段，企图据为己有，美帝国主义的豺狼成性可见一斑。他强调指出，美国同蒋介石集团之间签订的任何盗卖我国文物的契约在道义上和法律上都是没有任何效力的。
    中国科学院副院长陶孟和揭露了美帝国主义者几十年来对我国文物进行肆无忌惮的掠夺破坏的情况。他说，“我们绝不能容许美帝国主义者把这批文物劫离我国领土。”
    历史学家翦伯赞说，美帝国主义一向抱着打劫世界的野心。这次的劫夺行为再一次向全世界表明美帝国主义是不折不扣的强盗。我们要向全世界声明，台湾是中华人民共和国的领土，这批文物和台湾土地上的一草一木都属于中华人民共和国所有，美帝国主义根本无权劫夺、蒋介石集团更无权出卖。
    中国科学院考古研究所研究员徐炳昶痛斥美国到处巧取豪夺，偷窃拐骗的强盗行为。他着重指出，“北京人”的头骨原本是由中国方面在抗战初期寄存在北京协和医院的，但是，在太平洋战争爆发时，美国从协和医院将“北京人”头骨劫走，至今没有归还我国。
    曾经参加历次安阳发掘工作的考古学家郭宝钧说，在台文物不仅是我国劳动人民智慧的结晶，也是我国考古工作人员辛勤劳动的成果，绝不能任美帝国主义者恣意掠夺。他呼吁台湾有民族自尊心和爱国心的人士都起而抵制，同全国人民一道挽救这批文物。
    历史学家顾颉刚说，美帝国主义对我国文化遗产的掠夺是惊人的。例如美国哈佛大学曾经通过解放前的燕京大学每月盗运我国文物珍品十多箱，前后连续达十多年之久。他说，二十世纪六十年代的中国，已经不是十九世纪的中国了。我们绝不容许美帝国主义任意抢夺我国的文物。我们要在人民政府的领导下斗争到底，把被劫夺的我国文化珍宝全部收回来。
    雕刻家刘开渠指出，美国目前阴谋掠夺和过去已经劫走、破坏的我国艺术品，都是国家的无价之宝，对于我们继承、发扬祖国的优秀文化艺术遗产有极其重要价值。他说，“美国这次行劫完全暴露了美帝国主义在和平的幌子下，加紧向我国进行军事、政治、经济以至文化侵略的罪恶事实。我们美术工作者坚决反对美国侵略集团的掠夺行为。”
    故宫博物院研究员唐兰指责美帝国主义到处掠夺他人的文化遗产的肮脏行为。他说，我们要求被迫去台湾的故宫博物院和南京博物院的人员和台湾其他文物工作者力争不使这批文物沦落美国。
    在京台湾人士、中国文字改革委员会副研究员陈文彬说，我们对于美国图谋劫夺我国在台古物的罪行，表示非常愤慨。我们九百万台湾人民同全国人民一起，坚决反对美国侵占台湾、坚决反对美国盗劫我国在台古物的强盗勾当。
    常书鸿、韩寿萱、沈从文、赵万里、邓以蛰、单士元等在会上纷纷发言，强烈谴责美帝国主义盗劫我国文物的滔天罪行。
