　　This newspaper reports that "Vietnam News" in its second issue published an article summarizing the achievements of North Vietnam in cultural and artistic fields in 1959. The article states that 1959 was a year of significant achievements for Vietnamese culture and art. In order to implement the directives of the Party Central Committee, the Party committees of various provinces personally took the lead in guiding cultural and artistic work, which fully demonstrates the Party's emphasis on cultural and artistic work.

　　In order to strengthen the training of cultural and artistic cadres, the Higher School of Fine Arts, the School of Music, and the Secondary School of Arts and Crafts, which were established several years ago, were expanded and consolidated in 1959. In addition, a National Opera School and a National Dance School were newly established, and the directing and acting training classes of the Film School have also begun. The Cultural Cadre Refresher School has run three sessions. The above schools have a total of 1,283 students. Short-term refresher courses in dance, opera, drama, music, as well as training courses in cultural relic preservation, film projection and distribution, library work, photography, and recording broadcasting, have also been continuously opened and completed.

　　The work of showing films and slides has penetrated deeper into the mountainous areas and into various enterprises, construction sites, and farms, and is welcomed by the broad masses of working people.

　　New and innovative repertoires have emerged in various state-owned, private, and amateur theatrical troupes. These repertoires reflect the new socialist things that people are concerned about. For example, plays such as "Luba," "Qu Yuan," "Two Roads," "Gan Garden," "Awakening," and "Sea Storm" have attracted a wide audience.

　　Thirty-three provincial and municipal libraries, the Central Library, the Scientific Library, and tens of thousands of reading groups have attracted hundreds of thousands of readers. Various clubs and cultural centers are constantly strengthening their activities. Last year, significant progress was made in the cultural work of various agricultural production cooperatives, enterprises, construction sites, and farms. Art exhibitions, performances by various amateur art groups, and poetry creation activities are also more active than ever before.

　　The current cultural and artistic movement plays a significant role in ideological education and promoting production and technological innovation. Nhan Hoa Commune, Vinh Bao District, Kien An Province, has achieved great success in mass cultural movements, especially in reading movements, and has been awarded the Third-Class Labor Medal. The Ministry of Culture and the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor jointly organized the North Vietnam Enterprise and Hanoi Drama Festival, and organized stage art galas. Almost every province organized county or inter-county literary and art performances, and the programs performed were all self-written, self-directed, and self-performed by the masses, mostly focusing on agricultural cooperation, production movements, and opposing superstition and decadent lifestyles.

　　The Vietnam Film Studio has completed the production of its first feature film, "The Same River," and the large-scale documentary "Bac Hung Hai." The large-scale documentary "Bac Hung Hai" won a gold medal at the International Film Festival held in Moscow.

　　When participating in the Leipzig International Art and Book Exhibition in the German Democratic Republic, Vietnam won four gold, silver, and bronze medals. The Vietnamese Fine Arts Exhibition, after being exhibited in Moscow, continued to be exhibited in various Eastern European People's Democratic countries and received good reviews. At the 7th World Youth and Student Festival held in Vienna, the Tay Nguyen folk dance of Vietnam won a gold medal. Recently, at the 3rd International Photography Art Exhibition held in Hungary, Nguyen Duc Van's photograph "People's Night School" won a gold medal.

    党委挂帅  新人辈出  作品精采
    越南文化艺术事业欣欣向荣
    本报讯　“越南新闻”第二期发表文章，综述越南北方1959年在文化艺术方面的成就。文章说，1959年是越南文化艺术取得显著成就的一年。为了执行党中央的指示，各省委都亲自挂帅来领导文化艺术工作，这充分表现出党对文化艺术工作的重视。
    为了加强对文化艺术干部的培养，在1959年间已将几年前创办的高等美术学校、音乐学校、中等工艺美术学校等加以扩建和巩固，并新创办了一个民族歌剧学校、民族舞蹈学校，电影学校的导演和演员训练班也已经开学。文化干部补习学校已开办了三期。以上各校已拥有一千二百八十三名学生。舞蹈、歌剧、话剧、音乐等短期补习班，文物保管工作、电影放映和影片发行工作、图书馆工作、摄影工作、录音转播工作等训练班也连续开办和结业。
    放映影片和幻灯片工作更深入到高山区和各企业、工地、农场里去，它得到广大劳动群众的欢迎。
    各个国营剧团、民营和业余剧团都出现了新颖的剧目。这些剧目体现出人们所关心的社会主义新事物。如话剧“鲁巴”、“屈原”、“两条道路”、“柑园”、“觉悟”、“海上风暴”等剧目，都吸引了广大观众。
    三十三个省市图书馆、中央图书馆、科学图书馆和数以万计的读书小组吸引了成十万的读者。各个俱乐部、文化馆不断地加强活动。在去年，各个农业生产合作社、企业、工地、农场的文化工作都有显著的进步。美术展览、各业余艺术团体的表演以及诗歌创作等活动，也比以往任何时候都更加活跃。
    目前的文化艺术运动，对思想教育、促进生产和技术革新等起了很大的作用。建安省永保县人和乡在群众文化运动方面，特别是读书运动方面取得了巨大的成就，荣获三级劳动勋章。文化部和越南总工会曾经联合组织了全北越企业和河内话剧会演，并组织舞台艺术联欢会。几乎各省都组织了县或联县的文艺会演，演出的节目都是群众自编自导和自己表演的，大多数是以农业合作化和生产运动以及反对迷信和伤风败俗的生活为主题。
    越南电影制片厂已完成第一部故事片“同一条江”和大型纪录片“北兴海”的生产。“北兴海”大型纪录片在莫斯科举办的国际电影联欢节上获得了金质奖章。
    在参加德意志民主共和国来比锡国际艺术、书籍展览会的展出时，越南获得了四个金、银、铜质奖章。越南造型艺术展览在莫斯科展出后继续在东欧各人民民主国家展出，获得了好评。在维也纳举行的第七次世界青年和学生联欢节上，越南的西原民间舞蹈获得了金质奖章。最近在匈牙利举行的第三次国际摄影艺术展览会，阮德云的一张“民众夜校”的照片获得了金质奖章。
