Xinhua News Agency, Havana—The Cuban Revolutionary Court today sentenced one hundred and four counter-revolutionaries to prison terms ranging from three to thirty years. They were the main participants in the counter-revolutionary rebellion organized by the US-Trujillo alliance in August last year. That rebellion was cracked on the eve of the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Americas, which was planned by the United States with the aim of interfering in Cuba.

Among the criminals sentenced are Batista elements, fascist Franco elements, members of Trujillo's foreign legion, and reactionary large livestock owners in Cuba. Arturo Hernandez, Armando Kairuz, and Ramon Mestre—the puppet government members of the US-Trujillo alliance who conspired to replace the Castro government—the pseudo-president, premier, and key cabinet members—were also sentenced to imprisonment respectively.

The rebels' property, worth 20 million pesos, has been confiscated and will be transferred to the National Institute of Agrarian Reform.

Xinhua News Agency report from Washington: The United States government has officially decided to ask Congress to authorize President Eisenhower to reduce the US import quota for sugar from other countries at any time he deems it necessary for the "national interest." According to a United Press International report on the 10th, "Eisenhower's request for authority over sugar quotas is to gain greater flexibility in dealing with Castro's government in Cuba."

The United States government also announced that the government is preparing to ask Congress to increase the annual share of domestic producers by 200,000 tons, while reducing annual sugar imports by 200,000 tons. 96% of the reduction in import share comes from Cuba.

Commenting on the US government's preparations to revise the sugar import quota, the US "Christian Science Monitor" bluntly stated that "this measure is meaningful, it is handing something equivalent to a modern Marine Corps to the commander-in-chief, enabling him to use it at the most effective time."

    保卫革命成果必须坚决镇压革命敌人
    古巴判处一批反革命犯
    美国准备对古巴施加经济压力
    据新华社哈瓦那讯　古巴革命法庭今天对一百零四名反革命分子分别判处三年到三十年的徒刑。他们是美国—特鲁希略联盟在去年8月组织的反革命叛乱的主要参加者。那次叛乱是在美国策划的旨在干涉古巴的美洲外长会议前夕破获的。
    在被判处徒刑的罪犯中，有巴蒂斯塔分子、法西斯佛朗哥分子、特鲁希略的外国军团的成员和古巴反动的大畜牧业主。美国—特鲁希略联盟所拼凑的、阴谋取代卡斯特罗政府的傀儡政府成员——伪总统、总理和主要阁员阿图罗·埃尔纳德斯、阿曼多·凯纳斯和拉蒙·梅斯特雷也分别被判处徒刑。
    叛乱分子价值二千万比索的财产已被没收，它们将转给土地改革全国委员会。
    据新华社讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府已经正式决定要求国会授权总统艾森豪威尔在他认为“国家利益”需要时随时削减美国进口其他国家食糖的定额。据合众国际社10日报道，“艾森豪威尔要求在食糖定额方面授予权力是为了在对付古巴卡斯特罗政府的时候取得更大的伸缩性”。
    美国政府同时宣布，政府准备要求国会把国内生产者的每年份额提高二十万吨，同时把每年进口的糖减少二十万吨。削减的进口份额96％来自古巴。
    美国“基督教科学箴言报”的评论在谈到美国政府准备修改糖的进口定额一事时露骨地说，“这一措施是有意义的，这是把相当于现代海军陆战队的东西交到总司令手中，使他在最有效的时机来运用它。”
