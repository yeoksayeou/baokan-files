    Strive to Fulfill and Overfulfill the National Plan Ahead of Schedule

    The essence of the Party's general line for socialist construction is to mobilize all positive factors and develop our socialist construction cause at high speed. To implement this spirit in practical work, the first requirement is that all work should strive to fulfill the national plan comprehensively and ahead of schedule. Taking industrial enterprises as an example, the production plan of an enterprise is the specific embodiment of the requirements for building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way in the enterprise. Completing the plan ahead of schedule for each period means producing more products in less time and at a faster speed. This is a better realization of the comprehensive requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical, and it means striving for the upstream. The thinking and actions of the design workers in Shenyang precisely embody these spirits and requirements. They completed twelve months or six months of the plan ahead of schedule in just over a month. Isn't this making a greater contribution to the motherland in less time? Isn't this high speed? Obviously, if industrial enterprises can all learn and carry forward this spirit, then the entire industrial front will certainly be able to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward; if agriculture, finance and trade, culture and education, and other fronts also learn and carry forward this spirit, and everyone is ahead of schedule in everything they do, then our entire socialist construction cause will certainly be able to achieve a sustained, greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward.

    Completing the plan ahead of schedule not only makes people feel happy but also wins time, enabling people to have more opportunities to conduct in-depth investigations and research, calmly analyze and solve problems, and make full preparations for the next step. This will naturally make things better and better. Especially in industrial production, one of its characteristics is continuous production with each step connected and interlocked, and each step and matter requires advance preparation. This also requires striving to complete the plan ahead of schedule. Today, if the plan for this month is completed ahead of schedule, it can not only reduce the burden for tomorrow and next month, but also provide more adequate material conditions and free up resources to prepare for production. This will inevitably lead to faster completion and greater overfulfillment of the plans for tomorrow and next month. Since the beginning of this year, the industrial front in our province has created a new situation of continuous leap forward with a good start at the beginning of the month, the beginning of the quarter, and the beginning of the year, with daily success, ten-day success, and all-round success. The experience proves this point. To maintain the new normal of steady upward trend in current industrial production, we should rush forward in everything, always strive for initiative, prepare for everything, and strive to complete the plan ahead of schedule every day, every ten days, every month, and every quarter.

    Striving to be ahead of schedule and overfulfill the plan means doing everything faster and is to combine the journey that was originally planned to be completed in three steps into two. Striving to complete the plan ahead of schedule refers to completing an advanced and practical leap forward plan; it refers to completing comprehensive indicators such as output value, output, quality, cost, labor productivity, and safety. Only in this way can we meet the comprehensive requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical, and only then can we continue to leap forward in a better and more comprehensive way. To achieve this, according to the experience of the Shenyang design front, first of all, we must establish lofty ambitions to strive for the upstream and continue to leap forward, and establish a communist style of continuous revolution and courage to move forward. Secondly, after setting the leap forward goal, we must also find the leap forward method. Experience has proven that the main effective leap forward methods are to vigorously promote technological innovation and technological revolution.

    Now, half of the first quarter has passed, and February is the shortest month of the year. Every minute and every second is very precious for those of us who strive to complete the plan ahead of schedule. Therefore, every enterprise and every worker should muster greater efforts and rush forward as much as possible, so that production leaps forward on the track of high speed at all times. At present, we must first strive to complete the production plans for February and the first quarter ahead of schedule. If the plans for February and the first quarter are completed ahead of schedule, then the second, third, and fourth quarters, which have relatively more actual production time, can also complete the plans ahead of schedule with greater overproduction. In this way, we can also ensure that we complete the annual plan far ahead of schedule and overfulfill it, ensuring the realization of a better and more comprehensive continued leap forward this year.

### 力争提前超额完成国家计划

    力争提前超额完成国家计划
    党的社会主义建设总路线的实质，就是调动一切积极因素，高速度地发展我国的社会主义建设事业。把这种精神贯彻到实际工作中，首先就是要求一切工作都要力争提前全面完成国家计划。拿工业企业来说，一个企业的生产计划，就是多快好省地建设社会主义的要求在企业中的具体体现。提前完成每个时期的计划，就意味着用更少的时间，更快的速度，生产了更多的产品。这就是更好地实现了多快好省的全面要求，也就是争得了上游。沈阳设计职工的思想和行动，就恰恰体现了这些精神和要求。他们用一个多月的时间提前超额完成了十二个月或六个月的计划，这不就是用更少的时间给祖国作出了更大的贡献吗？这不就是高速度吗？显然，如果工业企业人人都能学习和发扬这种精神，那末整个工业战线就肯定能够实现更大更好更全面的跃进；如果农业战线、财贸战线、文教战线等各方面也都学习和发扬这种精神，做到人人提前、事事提前，那么，我们整个的社会主义建设事业，就更肯定地能够实现持续的更大更好更全面的跃进。
    提前超额完成计划，不仅人们心情舒畅，而且能赢得时间，使人们有更多的可能进行深入的调查研究，冷静地分析、解决问题，给下一步做好充分的准备工作，这样自然可以把事情办得越来越好。尤其是工业生产，其特点之一就是步步相连、环环紧扣的连续性生产，步步、事事都需要提前做好各项准备工作。这也就要求力争提前完成计划。今天，这月的计划提前超额完成了，对明天、下月就一能减轻负担，二能提供更充分的物质条件，三能腾出力量做好生产准备工作，这必然能使明天、下月的计划更快地提前完成，更多地超额完成。今年以来我省工业战线开创了月初、季初、年初开门红、日日红、旬旬红、满堂红的持续跃进的新局面，其经验就证明了这点。要把目前工业生产稳步上升的新常规保持下去，我们就应该一切都往前赶，时时争取主动，事事做好准备，力争每天、每旬、每月、每季都提前超额完成计划。
    力争提前超额，一切往前赶，就是说要把原来计划三步走的路程并作两步走。力争提前超额完成计划，是指完成既先进又切实的跃进计划；是指完成产值、产量和质量、成本、劳动生产率和安全等全面指标。这样才符合多快好省的全面要求，才是更好更全面的继续跃进。要做到这样，根据沈阳设计战线的经验，首先就必须树立起力争上游、持续跃进的雄心大志，树立起不断革命、勇往直前的共产主义风格。其次，立下跃进志，还要找到跃进方。经验证明，主要的行之有效的跃进方法，就是大搞技术革新和技术革命。
    现在第一季度已经过去一半了，二月份又是一年之中日子最少的一个月，每一分钟、每一秒钟，对我们力争提前超额完成计划的人来说都是非常宝贵的。因此每一个企业和每一个职工，都应该鼓起更大干劲，尽力往前赶，让生产时时刻刻地在高速度的轨道上跃进。当前首先要力争提前完成2月份和一季度的生产计划。2月份和第一季度的计划提前完成了，实际生产时间比较多的第二、三、四季度，也就可以提前更多、超产更多的完成计划，这样，也就能保证大大提前超额完成全年的计划，保证实现今年更好更全面的继续跃进。
