	Reclaiming Wasteland, Utilizing Water Surfaces, Planting Feed Extensively
	Jiangxi and Yunnan Adapt to the Needs of Large-Scale Pig Raising Development by Building Feed Bases Suitably to Local Conditions
	
	(By Our Newspaper) Jiangxi, making use of its favorable conditions of abundant mountains and water, has expanded its feed base by more than 400,000 mu in just two months. Together with the existing feed base, the province's feed base area has reached more than 1.2 million mu (including 310,000 mu of water surface), with an average of 1.5 fen of feed land per pig.
	In vigorously developing pig raising, Party organizations at all levels in Jiangxi have taken the establishment of feed bases as an important task. After launching a mass pig-raising campaign in Jiujiang Prefecture, the Prefectural Party Committee called on all people's communes in the region to vigorously reclaim wasteland and establish feed bases based on the requirement of one to two fen of feed land per pig. County and Commune Party Committees throughout the region immediately organized hundreds of thousands of commune members to build large-scale feed bases while running pig farms on a large scale. In just over two months, the region opened up 160,000 mu of feed base, making the average feed land per pig more than two fen. Yushan County, a red banner in pig raising, saw its pig population more than double at the beginning of 1959, achieving one pig per mu of farmland. In order to solve the feed problem, the County Party Committee, under the principle of not affecting grain production, allocated 7,400 mu of mature land as a feed base, and at the same time mobilized the masses to reclaim 8,500 mu of barren mountains and wasteland to expand feed planting, coupled with the large-scale use of mountain ponds and reservoirs to plant aquatic feed, ensuring sufficient feed after the large-scale development of pig raising.
	Making use of the advantageous conditions of abundant mountains to establish feed bases is also an important measure in Jiangxi's large-scale feed base construction. 60% of Jiangxi's area is mountainous, with abundant wild feed on the mountains, and a large amount of barren mountains and wasteland that can be used to reclaim and plant feed. According to a survey by the Gannan Administrative Region, there are thousands of kinds of wild grasses and vegetables that pigs can eat on the mountains all year round. People's communes throughout the region have adopted the method of "relying on the mountains for food," designating mountain areas as feed bases, and organizing special personnel to collect, strengthen cultivation and management. The Wuning County in Jiujiang Prefecture launched a "six-no-empty" campaign to expand feed planting, requiring that no barren mountains or wasteland should be empty, no field edges or corners should be empty, no roadsides should be empty, no ditch sides should be empty, no pond banks should be empty, and no reservoir sides should be empty. In just over a month, the county expanded its feed base by more than 23,000 mu.
	Jiangxi has millions of mu of mountain ponds, reservoirs, and lakes that can be utilized. Using these water surfaces to plant aquatic feed is also an important aspect of feed production. The Yichun Prefecture extensively launched a "greening water surface" campaign, using thousands of ponds and reservoirs to breed aquatic feed in large quantities. The Xiangdong Commune's Xincun Production Brigade in Pingxiang County of this prefecture "greened" more than a dozen ponds and reservoirs in the team, planting water hyacinth, water gourd, etc., making 57 pigs in the team have sufficient feed all year round.
	In order to improve the utilization rate of the feed base, various places strive for high feed yields. In order to make every mu of feed base high-yield and abundant, on the one hand, high-yield crops are planted, and on the other hand, specialized labor is fixed to strengthen the management of the feed base.
	
	(By Our Newspaper) After the Spring Festival, the people of Yunnan seized the golden opportunity to develop pig raising and launched a new upsurge of pig raising with a stronger momentum and larger scale. At present, the first secretaries of Party committees at all levels are leading a large number of cadres and masses to vigorously grasp breeding, expand feed planting, build pigsties, and prevent epidemics. Now there are more than 90,000 pig farms in the province, and the total number of pigs has increased to more than 2.3 million.
	The central link to ensure the great development of pig raising is the feed problem. Since last winter, more than one million people in the province have participated in reclamation, and 3.9 million mu of feed base have been opened up, of which more than 1.3 million mu have been planted with high-yield feed crops.
	On the already reclaimed land, various places have adopted the method of reclaiming, accumulating fertilizer, and sowing seeds at the same time, trying every means to strive to plant two to three seasons of feed crops. The people of all ethnic groups in Mojang County increased the original plan of planting 30,000 mu of canna edulis to 80,000 mu. In just five days, the county planted more than 86,000 mu of canna edulis, completing the task with an excess of 8%. The newly built thousands of collective pig farms in Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture are building farms, reclaiming wasteland, planting seeds, and raising pigs at the same time, and have planted more than 100,000 mu of feed. Various places in the province have also launched a movement for everyone to plant feed and every household to plant feed. Commune members have used the front and back of their houses to plant more than 2.3 million tang of canna edulis, angled luffa, etc.
	Since the fourth quarter of last year, Yunnan Province has seen a surging mass movement centered on the development of collective pig raising. In order to adapt to the situation of the high-speed development of pigs, the past method of relying solely on by-products of agricultural crops and collecting wild crops to solve feed problems has been unable to meet the needs. Therefore, various places have taken the establishment of feed bases as one of the important tasks of developing pig raising. Cultivated land in Yunnan Province only accounts for 6% of the total area, of which there are 14 million mu of barren land in the plains. 3.9 million mu have now been opened up as pig feed bases. Based on the calculation of raising three pigs per mu, these bases are enough to feed 9 million pigs; coupled with the old methods of solving feed, the province can obtain sufficient feed this year.
	In the process of opening up feed bases, the people's communes have fully demonstrated their superiority. The province quickly formed a reclamation army of more than 1.1 million people, who carried their luggage, tools, and cooking utensils, and showed their skills in the barren mountains, wild lands, and plateaus. On the Zhongdian Plateau, which is more than 3,000 meters above sea level, Tibetan farmers faced the difficulties of heavy snow and thousands of miles of ice, but they were not afraid. At first, they used wooden plows to break the frozen soil, so they burned the withered grass on the ground to thaw the land, and then used double-wheeled double-share plows to plow, which greatly improved work efficiency.

    开垦荒地　利用水面　大种饲料
    江西云南适应养猪大发展的需要因地制宜广建饲料基地
    本报讯　江西各地利用山多水多的有利条件，只用两个月的时间就扩大了饲料基地四十多万亩。连同原有的饲料基地，全省饲料基地面积已达一百二十多万亩（包括水面三十一万亩），平均每头猪有饲料地一分五厘。
    在大力发展养猪生产中，江西各级党组织把建立饲料基地，作为一项重要工作来抓。九江专区在掀起全民养猪运动后，地委就号召全区各个人民公社根据每头猪有一分到二分饲料地的要求，大力垦荒建立饲料基地。全区各县委、公社党委立即组织了数十万社员，在大办养猪场的同时，大建饲料基地。仅两个来月时间，全区就开辟了饲料基地十六万亩，使每头猪平均有饲料地二分多。养猪红旗玉山县，全县猪比1959年年初猛增两倍，做到亩田一头猪。县委为了解决饲料问题，在不影响粮食生产的原则下，拨出了七千四百亩熟地作饲料基地，同时又发动群众垦复荒山荒地扩种了八千五百亩饲料，再加上大量的利用山塘水库种植水生饲料，保证了养猪大发展后有充足的饲料。
    利用山多的有利条件建立饲料基地，也是江西大搞饲料基地建设的一项重要措施。江西60％的面积是山区，山上野生饲料丰富，还有大量的荒山荒地可以用来开垦种饲料。据赣南行政区调查，山上野生饲料一年四季都有，猪可以吃的野草、野菜有几千种。全区各人民公社采取“靠山吃山”的办法，划定山头作为饲料基地，并组织专人采集，加强培育管理。九江专区武宁县各个人民公社开展了一个“六不空”的扩种饲料运动，要求做到荒山荒地不空，田头地角不空，道路旁不空，水圳边不空，水塘岸不空，水库边不空，一个来月全县扩大了饲料基地二万三千多亩。
    江西可以利用的山塘、水库、湖泊面积有数百万亩，利用这些水面种植水生饲料，也是生产饲料的一个重要方面。宜春专区各地广泛开展了“绿化水面”运动，利用成千上万座的水塘、水库，大量繁殖水生饲料。这个专区的萍乡县湘东公社新村生产大队，将全队十多口水塘、水库“绿化”后，全部种上水浮莲、水葫芦等，使全队五十七头猪常年有了充足的饲料。
    为了提高饲料基地的利用率，各地力争饲料高产。为了使亩亩饲料基地高产丰收，一方面采取了种植高产作物，另方面固定了专门劳动力，加强饲料基地的管理。
    本报讯　春节后，云南人民抓紧发展养猪的黄金时刻，掀起了一个来势更猛、规模更大的养猪新高潮。目前，各级党委第一书记都带领大批干部和群众一齐大抓配种、扩种饲料、修建猪厩和防疫工作。现在全省已有养猪场九万多个，养猪总头数增加到二百三十多万头。
    保证养猪事业大发展的中心环节是饲料问题。去冬以来，全省参加垦荒的有一百多万人，已经开辟了三百九十万亩饲料基地，其中一百三十多万亩种上了高产饲料作物。
    在已开的荒地上，各地都采取了边开荒、边积肥、边播种的办法，千方百计争取能种下两季到三季的饲料作物。墨江县各族人民把原种芭蕉芋三万亩的计划增至八万亩，仅五天时间，全县就栽了芭蕉芋八万六千多亩，超额8％完成了任务。楚雄彝族自治州新建的几千个集体养猪场边建场、边开荒、边下种、边养猪，已种下饲料十万多亩。全省各地还掀起了一个人人种饲料、户户种饲料的运动，社员利用房前屋后种下芭蕉芋、洋丝瓜等二百三十多万塘。
    云南省从去年第四季度以来，群众性的以发展集体养猪为中心的运动声势汹涌，为了适应猪的高速度发展的形势，过去只依靠农作物副产品和采集野生作物等解决饲料的办法，已经不能满足需要。因此，各地把开荒建立饲料基地作为发展养猪的重要任务之一。云南全省耕地面积仅占全部面积的6％，其中平坝荒地就有一千四百万亩，现已开出三百九十万亩作为猪饲料基地，以每亩养猪三头计算，这些基地足够养活九百万头猪；加上历来解决饲料的老办法，全省今年可以获得充足的饲料。
    在开辟饲料基地中，人民公社充分发挥了优越性。全省迅速组成了一支一百一十多万人的开荒大军，他们携带行李、工具和炊具，在荒山野地和高原上大显身手。在海拔三千多米的中甸高原上，藏族农民面临大雪纷飞、千里冰封的困难而毫无畏惧。起先，他们使用木犁划不破冻土，就用火烧地上的枯草，让土地解冻，然后用双轮双铧犁翻犁，工效大大提高。
