A soulmate for Lofty Mountains and Flowing Waters
Zheng Ge

"A Hundred Thousand Troops Cut Off the Han River," this is the title of a dispatch published in the People's Daily, describing the Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Project. The brilliance of this sentence lies not only in its imposing manner and power, but also in its reflection of the new relationship between man transforming from a slave of nature to its master. If the Han River had consciousness, it would surely rejoice in its contribution to socialist construction, and celebrate encountering the heroic people under the leadership of the Communist Party, restoring its ancient life to youth.

The Han River brings to mind the story of Yu Boya and Zhong Ziqi, passed down for thousands of years: Yu Boya played the qin on the Han River, and Zhong Ziqi listened by the cliff. Whether Boya's heart was on lofty mountains or flowing waters, Ziqi could discern it from the sound of the qin. The following year, when Yu Boya went to visit him again, Zhong Ziqi had already passed away. Overwhelmed with grief, Yu Boya smashed his treasured qin. Zhong Ziqi not only understood the qin, but also understood the expression of lofty mountains and flowing waters within its music. He could be considered a soulmate of lofty mountains and flowing waters. However, he was born at the wrong time and could only die in frustration, resulting in a tragedy that "for millennia, made people lament the broken qin."

The mountains and rivers of our motherland, ever since life existed on Earth, have been lonely for tens of millions of years, never encountering a true soulmate. Having thousands of treasures and boundless wealth is all in vain. The Song Dynasty poet Jiang Baishi wrote: "The bright moon over Huainan chills thousands of mountains, drifting away into the darkness, with no one to care." But what is "drifting away into the darkness" is not just the bright moon over Huainan! How many lofty mountains spend their years in cold solitude, "with no one to care;" how many rivers, whether in violent storms or gentle breezes and ripples, flow day and night, leaving the motherland's landscape emaciated.

"Our land so rich in beauty compels countless heroes to bend their knees. Pity Qin Shi Huang and Emperor Wu of the Han, they lacked literary grace; Emperor Taizong of Tang and Emperor Taizu of Song, they were slightly inferior in poetic talent. Genghis Khan, the proud son of heaven, only knew how to bend the bow and shoot the great eagle. All are past and gone; to find men truly great, look to this age alone."

These are immortal lines written by Comrade Mao Zedong in 1945. But only today can we more deeply appreciate the great leader's magnificent spirit and scientific foresight. In the years of long darkness, in the years when the people's power was shackled, the landscape, despite its beauty, always appeared dim and lackluster. "Wait for a sunny day, to see the land adorned in red and white, exceptionally enchanting." It was not until ten years ago that the dark clouds were swept away, and a red sun slowly rose, bringing fair weather and a clear sky for ten thousand miles. The great liberation of the productive forces of six hundred million people meant that the lofty mountains and flowing waters spanning over nine million square kilometers would no longer worry about neglect and obscurity. In 1958, the drums of the Great Leap Forward sounded. Tens of thousands of people went to the mountains to plant greenery, open terraced fields, and even make steel; tens of thousands of people built reservoirs and dug canals, realizing a network of waterways. The people's communes showed their mettle for the first time, and the relationship between people and mountains and waters underwent unprecedented changes.

"The people's power is boundless, moving rivers and mountains twice over, grabbing mountains and throwing them into the sea, dragging rivers onto high mountains." What a heroic spirit!

"Commanding the three mountains and five peaks to clear the way, here I come!" What a sublime style!

"Draped in the wind of Xiaguan, treading on the snow of Cangshan, digging ditches on the mountaintop, covering the Erhai lake with the moon at night." What a vast and open mind!

"Rivers flow fast, streams flow slow, we still have the say. Tell the water to go, and it goes; tell the water to stop, and it stops; tell it to rise high and it dares not go low, tell it to generate electricity and it generates electricity." What a firm determination!

Are these just people's fantasies and wishes? No! The countless heroic achievements since the Great Leap Forward have already greatly surpassed what these folk songs sing of. People fight against nature, conquer barren mountains and deserts, and tame rivers and lakes. Telling mountains to bow their heads, telling rivers to make way, turning deserts into fertile fields, turning seas into land. These bold words began to turn into reality in just one or two years. Moreover, in the process of harnessing mountains and waters, people gradually mastered the laws of nature, understood the thoughts of mountains and waters, and figured out how to make them obediently serve socialism and communism. The Chinese people, astride the leaping horse of the Great Leap Forward, have truly become soulmates of the motherland's lofty mountains and flowing waters.

Repairing the Earth is a noble and magnificent task. Only the Communist Party, with its far-sighted vision and commitment to the world, only the people, liberated in thought under the Party's glorious light, can establish great ambitions and lofty aspirations, put this burden, which no one has ever thought of or dared to try for thousands of years, on their own shoulders, and get to work. We are determined to end the state of mountains being neglected and rivers flowing in vain. "Only when there is a Bole is there a Chollima." When six hundred and fifty million people, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought's red banner, develop the communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, when everyone becomes a Bole of the socialist era, the motherland's beautiful landscape, these countless Chollimas, will be completely overturned, and they will be able to change themselves according to people's wishes, under people's whim, and exert endless potential in the great project of building a beautiful paradise on earth.

### 高山流水的知音

    高山流水的知音
    郑歌
    “十万雄师斩汉江”，这是登在人民日报上一篇描写丹江口水利工程的通讯的题目。这句话之所以精彩，还不仅在于有气势，有力量；更在于它反映了人从自然的奴隶变成了自然的主人的新关系。如果汉水有知，一定会为自己能对社会主义建设有所贡献而高兴，也一定会庆幸遇到共产党领导下的英雄人民，使它的古老的生命又恢复了青春。
    从汉水使人想起流传了千百年的俞伯牙和钟子期的故事：俞伯牙在汉江上弹琴，钟子期在崖边听奏。无论伯牙心在高山还是流水，子期从琴音里都能辨别出来。第二年，俞伯牙再去访他，钟子期却已经亡故。俞伯牙悲恸之余，就把瑶琴摔碎了。想那钟子期不仅懂得琴，而且懂得高山流水在琴声里的表现，也可以算得是高山流水的知音。然而，他生不逢辰，只能郁郁以终，演成一出“千古令人说破琴”的悲剧。
    祖国的山山水水，从地球上有生命以来，也正是寂寞了几千万年，没有遇到真正的知音。纵有千种宝藏，万般财富，也是枉然。宋朝词人姜白石写过：“淮南皓月冷千山，冥冥归去无人管。”其实，“冥冥归去”的岂仅是淮南的皓月！多少座高山，冷冷清清地过着“无人管”的岁月；多少条江河，不管是狂风大浪也罢，微风细浪也罢，日也流，夜也流，把祖国江山都流瘦了。
    “江山如此多娇，引无数英雄竞折腰。惜秦皇汉武，略输文采；唐宗宋祖，稍逊风骚。一代天骄，成吉思汗，只识弯弓射大雕。俱往矣，数风流人物，还看今朝。”
    这是毛泽东同志1945年写下的不朽的名句。但直到今天，我们才能稍为深切一些地体会伟大的领袖的磅礴气概和科学预见。在长夜漫漫的年代，在人民的力量被束缚的年代，江山尽管娇好，也总是显得暗淡无光。“须晴日，看红妆素裹，分外妖娆。”直到十年以前，乌云扫尽了，一轮红日冉冉上升，从此风和日丽，万里晴空。六亿人民生产力的大解放，使纵横九百多万平方公里的高山流水，从此再不愁冷落和埋没。到了1958年，大跃进的战鼓响起，成千上万的人上山搞绿化，开梯田，以至大炼钢铁；成千上万人修水库，挖渠道，实现河网化。人民公社初试锋芒，人和山水的关系，也就起了亘古未有的变化。
    “人民力量大无边，一搬河水二搬山，抓起大山抛下海，拖着河水上高山。”这是何等豪迈的气魄！
    “喝令三山五岳开道，我来了！”这是何等崇高的风格！
    “身披下关风，脚踏苍山雪，山顶开沟去，晚盖洱海月。”这是何等辽阔的胸襟！
    “河水急，江水慢，还得我们说了算。叫水走，水就走，叫水站，水就站；叫它高来不敢低，叫它发电就发电。”这是何等坚强的决心！
    难道这些只是人们的幻想和愿望吗？不！大跃进以来无数的英雄业绩，早已大大地超过这些民歌所吟咏的了。人们同自然作战，征服荒山大漠，驯服江河湖海。叫高山低头，叫河水让路，叫沙漠变成良田，叫大海变成陆地。这些豪言壮语，在一两年间都开始变成现实。而且，在治山治水的过程里，逐渐掌握了自然的规律，懂得山和水的心思，摸到了如何使它们乖乖地为社会主义、共产主义服务的门道。跨上跃进骏马的中国人民，真正成为祖国高山流水的知音了。
    修理地球，这是一项崇高而宏伟的任务。只有高瞻远瞩，以天下为己任的共产党，只有在党的光辉照耀下，解放了思想的人民，才能树雄心，立大志，把这个几千年来从没人想到和敢于尝试的重担，放在自己的双肩上，并且动手就干。我们决心要结束使高山冷落、使河水白流的状态。“世有伯乐，然后有千里马。”当六亿五千万人民在毛泽东思想的红旗引导下，发扬敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，人人都成为社会主义时代的伯乐的时候，祖国的大好江山，这无数匹千里马，就会彻底翻了个身，就能在人的随心所欲的支配下，按照人的意志来改变自己，在建设美好的人间天堂的伟大工程里，发挥无穷无尽的潜力。
