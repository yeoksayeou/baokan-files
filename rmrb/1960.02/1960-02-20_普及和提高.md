    Popularization and Improvement
    Hua Ren
    It is encouraging that Wang Baojing, a special farmer researcher at the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, has gone to university.
    It is equally encouraging that the Fenghuo People's Commune in Qian County, Shaanxi Province, is training technical personnel on its own.
    Wang Baojing is going to university to systematically study cultural and scientific knowledge, so as to contribute more to agricultural technological transformation. The Fenghuo People's Commune is carrying forward the spirit of self-reliance, and in just over a year, it has trained more than a thousand technical personnel, and many technical problems can be solved by themselves.
    Wang Baojing goes to university for improvement; the Fenghuo People's Commune trains technical personnel for popularization. The combination of the two vividly embodies the Party's "walking on two legs" policy for training technical personnel.
    Popularization and improvement are a dialectical unity of opposites. Neglecting either popularization or improvement will not rapidly change the backwardness of our country's culture and science, and promote the leap-forward development of production. In the past, especially in the past two years, great achievements have been made on the education front because of the correct implementation of the popularization and improvement as well as a series of the Party's "walking on two legs" educational policies. Today, with the rapid advancement of the cultural revolution and the technological revolution, it is even more necessary to adhere to the "walking on two legs" policy in order to adapt to the development of the great situation.
    Agricultural technological transformation requires a large number of technical personnel. In the 1960s, there is a need for millions of senior and middle-level agricultural technicians, and an even greater number of junior technicians. However, the current number of agricultural technicians is still very small, which not only cannot meet future requirements, but also cannot meet current requirements. This is a contradiction. To solve this contradiction, in addition to the state continuing to run schools and various training courses, all localities should develop agricultural middle schools and spare-time agricultural education self-reliantly, and popularize agricultural technical knowledge to farmers. The Fenghuo Commune Party Committee has recognized this situation and has taken various measures to popularize agricultural technical education, which has had an immediate effect and promoted production.
    On the other hand, attention should also be paid to improvement. It should be seen that with the rapid development of agricultural technical innovation and the technological revolution movement, the quality of agricultural technicians is increasingly required to be improved. Therefore, it is not enough to just popularize, but it is necessary to carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution and also to focus on the work of improvement. Comrade Mao Zedong said well: "The people demand popularization, and then they demand improvement, demanding improvement year by year and month by month. Here, popularization is the popularization of the people, and improvement is also the improvement of the people. And this kind of improvement is not an improvement from the air, not an improvement behind closed doors, but an improvement on the basis of popularization. This kind of improvement is determined by popularization and at the same time gives guidance to popularization." ("Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art") We must hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and while popularizing, we must also focus on improvement. Now, the Fenghuo People's Commune has set such an example. In addition to sending Wang Baojing to university for further study, the commune also plans to focus on training a group of middle-level and senior technical personnel in the next few years to continuously meet the needs of the technological revolution. All localities should, like the Fenghuo Commune, adopt the method of large-scale popularization and key improvement to train more agricultural technical personnel to meet the needs of the vigorous development of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement.

    普及和提高

    中国农业科学院陕西分院的特约农民研究员王保京上大学了，令人鼓舞。
    陕西省乾县烽火人民公社自己动手培养技术人材，同样令人鼓舞。
    王保京上大学，是为了系统地学习文化科学知识，以便为农业技术改造贡献更大的力量。烽火人民公社发扬自力更生的精神，在一年多的时间里，就培养了一千多名技术人材，许多技术问题都能自己解决。
    王保京上大学，是为了提高；烽火人民公社培养技术人材是普及。两者结合，鲜明地体现了党的“两条腿走路”培养技术人材的方针。
    普及和提高，是对立统一的辩证关系。忽视普及或者忽视提高，都不能迅速地改变我国文化科学的落后面貌，推动生产的飞跃发展。过去，特别是近两年来，由于正确地贯彻了普及和提高以及党的一系列“两条腿走路”的教育方针，因而在教育战线上取得了伟大的成绩；在文化革命和技术革命迅猛前进的今天，更须坚持“两条腿走路”的方针，才能适应大好形势的发展。
    农业技术改造，需要大量的技术人材。在六十年代中，需要成百万的高级和中级的农业技术人员，和为数更大的初级技术人员。但是，目前农业技术人员的数量还很少，不但满足不了将来的要求，也不能满足目前的要求。这是一个矛盾。要解决这一矛盾，除国家继续兴办学校和各种训练班外，各地应当自力更生地发展农业中学、业余农业教育，并向农民普及农业技术知识。烽火公社党委认清了这一形势，采取了各种办法来普及农业技术教育，立竿见影，推动了生产。
    另一方面，还要注意提高。应该看到，随着农业技术革新和技术革命运动的迅速发展，越来越要求提高农业技术人员的质量。因此，不能只是普及，而要发扬不断革命的精神，也须抓紧提高的工作。毛泽东同志说得好：“人民要求普及，跟着也就要求提高，要求逐年逐月地提高。在这里，普及是人民的普及，提高也是人民的提高。而这种提高，不是从空中提高，不是关门提高，而是在普及基础上的提高。这种提高，为普及所决定，同时又给普及以指导。”（“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”）我们要高举毛泽东思想的旗帜，在普及的同时，就抓提高。现在，烽火人民公社已经树立了这样的榜样。这个公社除了派王保京到大学去深造外，还准备在最近几年内，重点地培养出一批中级和高级技术人材，以不断满足技术革命的需要。各地应当像烽火公社那样，采用大量普及和重点提高的方法，培养更多的农业技术人材，以适应技术革新和技术革命运动蓬勃发展的需要。
