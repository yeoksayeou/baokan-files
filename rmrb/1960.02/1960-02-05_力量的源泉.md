The Source of Strength
Jin Xing, Secretary of the CCP Chengdu Steel Plant Committee

Looking at the Great Leap Forward from the birth and development of our plant, everyone more deeply appreciates the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought, which inspires people to further establish the idea of continuous leaps forward and the ambitious goal of building socialism at high speed.

Our Chengdu Steel Plant was built and developed in August 1958. If we had acted according to "conventional" methods, it would have taken two or three years to put it into production. Under the leadership of the Party, we broke this "convention" and greatly accelerated the construction speed, completing the plant in just over six months. Iron was smelted forty-five days after groundbreaking, steel was smelted one hundred and three days after, and steel was rolled one hundred and eighty-one days after. By building and producing simultaneously, we not only fulfilled and overfulfilled the state plans for pig iron, steel, steel products, and coking coal in 1959 ahead of schedule but also trained a large number of technical personnel for the country. What does this illustrate? It illustrates the immense power of the Party's general line for socialist construction and Mao Zedong Thought. The source of our strength is Mao Zedong Thought. Holding high the red flag of the general line and the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought means victory and the ability to build socialism more, faster, better, and more economically.

Over the past year or so, we have deeply realized in our work that adhering to putting politics in command and launching mass movements can continuously achieve leaps forward. For example, in the early stages of building the plant, we encountered difficulties such as a shortage of equipment and raw materials. We fully mobilized the masses, vigorously promoted self-reliance, combined indigenous and foreign methods, and sought to have something before seeking completeness. These difficulties were resolved, ensuring the rapid progress of the capital construction project. For example, after the plant went into production, we encountered the contradiction of weak technical strength that could not keep up with the needs of production development. Our solution was still to fully mobilize the masses, rely on our own efforts, and vigorously promote technical demonstrations, learning and doing simultaneously. The technical strength then met the needs of production. It is the urgent desire of the broad masses to quickly build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. The masses possess inexhaustible labor enthusiasm and creativity. Therefore, as long as we rely on the masses and arm them with Mao Zedong Thought, they can create miracles.

Following the great victory of 1959, our plant, like other places, presented an excellent situation. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers was even greater, and the entire plant showed a vivid scene of pacesetters in every industry, mutual learning and mutual assistance, catching up with each other, and large-scale bumper harvests. The material conditions created by the Great Leap Forward in the previous two years and the political and ideological conditions created by the deep-rooted general line have provided extremely favorable conditions for continuing the leap forward this year. The workers of our plant are determined to hold the red flag of the general line even higher and strive to achieve a red start in January, a red month every month, a red house full of successes, and a red end to the year!

    力量的源泉
    中共成都钢铁厂委员会书记　金星
    从我们厂的诞生和发展来看大跃进，每个人都更加深切地体会到毛泽东思想的巨大力量，它鼓舞着人们进一步树立不断跃进的思想和高速度建设社会主义的雄心大志。
    我们成都钢铁厂是在1958年8月兴建和发展起来的。如果按照“常规”办事，需要两三年的时间才能投入生产；在党的领导下，我们却打破了这个“常规”，大大地加快了建设速度，仅用了半年多的时间，就建成了。破土兴工后四十五天就炼出了铁，一百零三天就炼出了钢，一百八十一天就轧出了钢材。由于边建设边生产，我们不仅提前和超额完成了1959年生铁、钢、钢材、煤焦的国家计划，还为国家培养了大批的技术人材。这件事说明什么呢？它说明了党的社会主义建设总路线和毛泽东思想的巨大力量。我们力量的源泉就是毛泽东思想，高举总路线的红旗，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，就是胜利，就能又多又快又好又省地建设社会主义。
    一年多来，我们在工作中深深地体会到：坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，便能不断实现跃进。比如在建厂初期，我们曾碰到设备、原材料不足的困难，我们便充分发动群众，大闹自力更生，土洋结合，先求有，后求全，这些困难便得到了解决，保证了基建工程的快速进行。又如在工厂投入生产后，曾碰到技术力量薄弱，赶不上生产发展需要的矛盾，我们解决的办法仍是充分发动群众，自力更生，大搞技术表演，边学边做，技术力量便满足了生产的需要。迅速地把我国建成一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国，是广大群众的迫切愿望；在群众中蕴藏着无穷无尽的劳动积极性和创造性。因此，只要依靠群众，用毛泽东思想武装群众，群众便能创造出奇迹来。
    随着1959年的伟大胜利，我厂和其他各地一样，呈现了一派大好形势，广大职工群众的革命干劲更大了，全厂出现了行行有标兵、互学互帮、你追我赶、大面积丰产的生动局面。前两年大跃进所创造的物质条件和总路线深入人心所造成的政治和思想条件，为今年继续跃进提供了极为有利的条件。我厂职工决心更高地举起总路线的红旗，在今年开门红的基础上，为实现月月红、满堂红、红到底而奋斗！
