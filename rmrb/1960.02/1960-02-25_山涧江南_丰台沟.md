    Mountain Ravine Jiangnan -- Fengtai Ravine
    Dang Rongguo
    Although it is still the depths of winter, the Fengtai Ravine Production Team of the Lusha'er Commune under the Dongjian Ridge in Huangzhong County, Qinghai Province, is a hive of activity. A bustling scene of spring plowing preparation is visible on and around the mountains: commune members are driving lines of carts and pushing wheelbarrows loaded with fertilizer along the winding mountain road to the terraced fields. Many commune members are tilling the land to conserve moisture. At the Dujiagou entrance at the foot of Dongjian Ridge, dozens of young men and women are busy building a "Youth Reservoir" with a capacity of 50,000 cubic meters. This group of energetic young people are using blasting methods to level the entire Xiayagou, turning the bottom of the ravine into a flat river terrace and the banks into terraced platforms, increasing the cultivated land by one hundred mu. In this way, on the basis of terracing the slopes, they will soon be able to realize the transformation of gullies into river terraces and reservoirs.
            The Days of the Past
    Decades ago, the area of Fengtai Ravine was a flat滩 (beach) abundant in irises. People lived on both sides of the flat滩. Due to the oppression and exploitation by the reactionary ruling class, the peasants lacked food, clothing, and firewood, scavenging for coal cinders and digging up sod everywhere. The irises were dug up, and the vegetation on the mountains was destroyed. Over time, a hillside overgrown with vegetation and the iris灘 were completely ruined. As a result, every time there was a rainstorm, mud and water flowed down, and about 3.5 centimeters of topsoil was washed away each year. Fengtai Ravine was eroded into a maze of gullies, and the iris ravine was washed into a large ditch, splitting a good village in half and forming an inconvenient "Split Terrace Ravine." The serious soil erosion resulted in: drought in the absence of rain, and floods during rainfall. Crop yields were extremely low, and the peasants lived in great poverty. In the early days of liberation, the yield per mu in Fengtai Ravine was only seventy or eighty jin, and at most no more than one hundred and twenty jin. The vast majority of the village's more than ninety households lived a miserable life of not having enough to eat. At that time, twenty households in the village were forced to leave their homes and wander elsewhere due to the pressure of life.
              Man Will Conquer Nature
    After liberation, under the wise leadership of the Party and with the strong support of the state, the people of Fengtai Ravine launched an unyielding struggle against the poor mountains and rivers. Starting in 1956, they engaged in large-scale soil and water conservation, controlling the mountains and harnessing the water. At first, some people, especially the elderly, had great concerns about controlling the mountains and harnessing the water and lacked confidence. They said: "The mountains are high and the ravines are deep, how can human power control them?" "Even if it can be controlled, how long will it take?" In response to these thoughts among the masses, the Party branch organized the masses to speak out freely and debate extensively, and used the specific facts of the flooding of five hundred mu of land in Dongwan in 1955, which resulted in the loss of more than 28,000 jin of grain, to educate the masses to understand the root cause of the mountainous area's poverty. Then, the Party branch secretary led a youth shock brigade of forty people to select Dongwan, where soil erosion was severe, and built check dams, dug silt traps, contour ditches, and crescent pits from top to bottom, from the ridge to the foot of the mountain, and began afforestation and grass planting. In late July of that year, there was a rainstorm, and although a major flash flood occurred, these soil and water conservation projects prevented the loss of five hundred mu of land in Dongwan. The living facts made the commune members realize that large-scale soil and water conservation could quickly change the face of the mountainous area, thus further establishing a strong belief that man will conquer nature. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the team launched a movement to control the mountains and harness the water and explored a set of experiences in transforming the mountainous area. That is: in large-scale soil and water conservation projects, it must be slope surface first, then ravines, from the top of the mountain to the foot of the mountain, from the head of the gully to the mouth of the gully, and comprehensive management is carried out gully by gully and bay by bay. Adopting this method, the results were achieved quickly. By 1958, in just three years, the soil erosion of the barren slopes and gullies was basically controlled, achieving the goal of soil not leaving the mountain and water not leaving the gully. After communization, the people of Fengtai Ravine had even greater enthusiasm for controlling the mountains and harnessing the water. They held high the glorious banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and continued to advance towards high standards of soil and water conservation. During this period, the Lusha'er Commune organized more than 2,000 commune members from other brigades to help Fengtai Ravine in crash-building terraced fields; the neighboring fraternal commune—Handong Commune—also sent more than 1,000 laborers to support them, greatly accelerating the construction of the mountainous area in Fengtai Ravine. By the end of last December, Fengtai Ravine had cultivated a total of 3,864 mu of field ridges, realizing the transformation of land into ridges; built 3,553 mu of terraced fields (accounting for 86% of all cultivated land); built a reservoir with a storage capacity of 76,000 cubic meters, installed two water pumps, which can pump water to irrigate 1,200 mu of land; dug 81,000 meters of contour ditches, 291,200 crescent pits, 218,300 contour steps, 354 silt traps, 403 water簸箕 (water wheels), and 726 mu of stepped terraces, 248 check dams. The completion of these water conservancy projects enabled Fengtai Ravine to quickly realize the terracing of slopes, the water conservancy of terraced fields, and the transformation of gullies into river terraces.
            The New Look of Fengtai
    If someone who left Fengtai Ravine four years ago returned home now, he would be greatly surprised and think he had taken the wrong road and run into the wrong village. Yes, Fengtai Ravine has completely changed and become a veritable Mountain Ravine Jiangnan. In the past, it was "barren mountains and ridges, where grain was difficult to grow"; now, not only are there neat terraces built up to the top of the slopes, but in recent years, more than 5,000 mu of forests have been planted, 1,020,000 trees have been planted, 1,000 mu of mountains have been closed for afforestation, 480 mu of sweet clover have been planted, and 34 mu of alfalfa have been planted. In addition, an orchard of 304 mu has been established, with 30,557 fruit trees planted, and a red scarf forest belt of ten kilometers has been created, realizing the landscaping of the land. The team averages more than 1,200 trees and 37 fruit trees per person. In the past, Fengtai Ravine only had apricots, but now there are not only apricots, but also apples, plums, walnuts, pears, crabapples..., and peonies, herbaceous peonies, prickly roses, lilacs, chrysanthemums, etc. are also cultivated in the orchards. If you come here in spring or autumn, you can see that it is a place where green forests provide shade and flowers are fragrant everywhere. In the past, the iris灘 was a large ravine 500 meters long, 34 meters wide, and 20 meters deep; now, the commune members of Fengtai Ravine have transformed it into Fangsheng Lake, which can store more than 70,000 cubic meters of water. In the past, Fengtai Ravine was a maze of gullies, where the road was difficult to walk during the day, and at night, one would accidentally fall into the gully; now, the commune members of Fengtai Ravine have built a ten-li-long motor road that leads directly to the mouth of the gully, and seven winding mountain roads, which can be used to transport fertilizer directly to the terraced fields on the top of the slope by carts and wheelbarrows.
    The result of large-scale mountainous area construction centered on soil and water conservation has not only changed the natural appearance of Fengtai Ravine, but also greatly promoted the development of agricultural production. In the first year of realizing soil not leaving the mountain and water not leaving the gully—1958—the team achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The average grain yield per mu reached 330 jin, nearly three times higher than before liberation, and 62.6% higher than in 1957 before the Great Leap Forward. With the development of production, the income of commune members has greatly increased, and their lives have continuously improved. In 1958, the total income of the team reached more than 100,000 yuan, and each person received more than 130 yuan; while before the cooperation movement, the average income per rich middle peasant was only 74 yuan. This shows that the living standards of the vast number of commune members have greatly exceeded the living standards of rich middle peasants before the cooperation movement. In 1959, although the team suffered three hailstorms in a row, it still won a bumper harvest. In addition to retaining enough grain and seeds, the team also overfulfilled the state's procurement tasks. Now, the people of Fengtai Ravine have used their own hands to transform the "Split Terrace Ravine, Poor Terrace Ravine, where it is difficult to get water and walk" which has been circulated for many years into "Fengtai Ravine, Rich Mountain Ravine, where there is plenty of food and clothing and happiness is boundless."

    山涧江南——丰台沟
    党荣国
    虽然还是严寒的数九天，可是青海省湟中县东尖岭下的鲁沙尔公社丰台沟生产队，却是热气腾腾。山上山下一片繁忙的备耕景象：社员们赶着一溜溜大车，推着一趟趟手推车，沿着盘山大道，把肥料送到一层层的梯田里。梯田上有许多社员正在打地保墒。在东尖岭脚下的杜家沟口，有几十个男女青年正忙着修一座蓄水五万立方米的“青年水库”。这群干劲十足的年青人，用爆破的方法，要把下崖沟全部炸平，沟底修成川台地，两岸修成水平台阶，增加一百亩耕地。这样一来，他们在坡地梯田化的基础上，很快又可以实现沟壑川台水库化。
            过去的日子
    几十年以前，丰台沟这块地方，还是一片盛产马莲的大平滩。平滩两边住着人家。由于反动统治阶级的压榨剥削，农民少吃没穿缺柴烧，到处扫炭渣、挖草皮，马莲草挖掉了，山上的草木挖掉了，年长日久，一个草木丛生的山坡和马莲滩就给破坏完了。这样一来，每逢暴雨，泥水俱下，每年被洪水冲去的表土就有三点五厘米左右。丰台沟被冲成个千沟万壑，马莲沟冲成一条大沟，一个好好的村庄劈成两半，形成一座行走不便的“分台沟”。严重水土流失带来的结果是：无雨干旱成灾，有雨山洪为害。庄稼收成极少，农民生活十分贫困。解放初期丰台沟亩产仅七、八十斤，最高也不过一百二十斤。全村九十多户人家，绝大部分过着食不果腹的悲惨生活。那时候，全村有二十户人家为生活所迫，不得不背井离乡，飘流在外。
              人定胜天
    解放后，在党的英明领导下，在国家的大力支援下，丰台沟人民向穷山恶水展开了不屈不挠的斗争。从1956年起，大搞水土保持，治山治水。开始，有些人特别是老年人，对治山治水顾虑很大，缺乏信心。他们说：“山高沟深，人力如何控制得住？”“就是能控制住，那该要多长时间啊？”针对群众中这些思想，党支部组织群众大鸣大放大辩论，并以1955年东湾五百亩地遭洪水淹没，损失粮食二万八千多斤的具体事实，教育群众认识到山区贫瘠的根本原因。接着，党支部书记又带领一支四十人的青年突击队，选择水土流失严重的东湾，从上而下，由山岭到山脚，大筑谷坊，挖涝池、水平沟、月牙坑等工程，并开始了造林种草。当年7月下旬下了一次暴雨，虽发生特大山洪，但这些水土保持工程却使东湾五百亩地避免了损失。活生生的事实使社员们认识到，大搞水土保持能够很快地改变山区面貌，从而更加树立了人定胜天的坚强信念。在党支部的领导下，这个队开展了治山治水运动，并摸索到了一套改造山区的经验。这就是：在大搞水土保持工程中，必须是先坡面后沟壑，从山顶到山脚，从沟头到沟口，先大沟后支沟，一沟一湾地进行全面治理。采取这套方法，收效很快，到1958年仅三年的时间，就基本治住了荒坡沟壑的水土流失，做到了土不下山，水不出沟。公社化以后，丰台沟人民治山治水的干劲更大了，他们高举总路线、大跃进和人民公社的光辉旗帜，继续向水土保持高标准化前进。在此期间，鲁沙尔公社曾组织其他大队的两千多名社员，先后到丰台沟帮助突击修梯田；临近的兄弟公社——汉东公社，也出动了一千多劳力前来支援，大大加快了丰台沟的山区建设。到去年12月底，丰台沟共培地埂三千八百六十四亩，实现了地埂化；修梯田三千五百五十三亩（占全部耕地的86％）；修成蓄水七万六千立方米的水库一座，安装了两台抽水机，能抽水灌地一千二百亩；挖水平沟八万一千米，月牙坑二十九万一千二百多个，水平阶二十一万八千三百多米，涝池三百五十四个，水簸箕四百零三个，台阶田七百二十六亩，谷坊二百四十八个。这些水利工程的完成，使丰台沟迅速实现了坡地梯田化，梯田水利化，沟壑川台化。
            丰台新貌
    丰台沟四年前外出的人，如果现在回家的话，他会大吃一惊，以为自己走错了道路，跑错了村庄。是的，丰台沟已经完全变了样，成了名副其实的山涧江南。过去，这里是“荒山秃岭，谷禾难生”；现在，这里不仅有整整齐齐地修上坡顶的各式梯田，而且几年来已经造林五千余亩，植树一百零二万株，封山育林一千亩，种草木樨四百八十亩，苜蓿三十四亩。此外，还建立了三百零四亩的果园一座，种植果树三万零五百五十七株，营造红领巾林带十公里，实现了大地园林化。全队每人平均有树一千二百多株，果树三十七株。过去，丰台沟只有杏子一种果树，可是现在不仅有杏子，还有苹果、李子、核桃、梨、海棠……，果树林里还栽培有牡丹、芍药、刺玫瑰、丁香、菊花等等。你如果在春天或是夏秋季来一趟，可以看到这里是绿林成荫，处处花香。过去，马莲滩是条长五百米、宽三十四米、深二十米的大涧滩；现在，丰台沟社员却把它改造成一座可蓄水七万多立方米的丰胜湖。过去，丰台沟是千沟万壑，白天路难走，晚上不小心就会跌到沟里去；现在，丰台沟社员修了一条十里长的汽车路，直通沟口，修了七条盘山大道，可以用大车、手推车把肥料直送坡顶梯田。
    大搞以水土保持为中心的山区建设的结果，不仅改变了丰台沟的自然面貌，而且大大促进了农业生产的发展。实现土不下山，水不出沟的第一年——1958年，这个队就获得了空前大丰收。粮食平均亩产达到三百三十斤，比解放前提高将近三倍，较大跃进前的1957年提高62．6％。随着生产的发展，社员收入大大增加，生活不断改善。1958年全队总收入达十万元以上，每人分到一百三十多元；而合作化前富裕中农平均每人收入才七十四元。这说明广大社员的生活水平，已经大大超过了合作化前富裕中农的生活水平。1959年这个队虽然连遭三次雹害，但仍然争得了丰收。全队除了留足口粮、籽种以外，还超额完成了国家的征购任务。现在，丰台沟人民用自己的双手，已经把流传多少年的“分台沟，穷台沟，吃水走路也发愁”，改造成“丰台沟，富山沟，丰衣足食乐无忧”。
