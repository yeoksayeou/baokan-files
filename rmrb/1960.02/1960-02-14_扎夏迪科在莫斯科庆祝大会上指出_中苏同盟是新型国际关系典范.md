Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 13th: According to TASS, Moscow, February 12th: Alexander Zashadyko, Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, delivered a report entitled "The Tenth Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance" at the Moscow celebration meeting for the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance.

He said that ten years ago, a momentous event of historical significance occurred in the life of human society. The two great socialist countries—the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China—signed the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance for the fundamental interests of the two peoples and the cause of world peace.

Zashadyko then described the deep-rooted friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, and focused on the enormous development of the friendly and cooperative relations between the two peoples since the victory of the October Revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Zashadyko said that the permanent alliance and unbreakable friendship between the Soviet Union and China are a model of the new type of international relations established among socialist countries on the basis of the Leninist principle of proletarian internationalism. The increasingly broad and comprehensive economic and cultural cooperation between the Soviet Union and China is a vivid manifestation of the growing consolidation of the friendship between our two countries. On the basis of the Soviet-Chinese treaties and agreements, the Soviet Union has helped and will continue to help the People's Republic of China build and rebuild 291 large-scale industrial projects. We Soviets are pleased that the Chinese industrial enterprises built with our participation are now playing an important role in the further development of the economy of the great brotherly country.

Zashadyko emphasized that the Soviet people are proud of the extremely outstanding achievements made by the Chinese working people. The revolutionary spirit and inexhaustible energy of the Chinese people, who selflessly dedicate all their strength to the prosperity of their beautiful motherland, are dear and understandable to the Soviet people. Our people fully understand that the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the achievements in socialist construction are possible because of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong.

Zashadyko said that many events that have occurred in the world in the past ten years have convincingly proved that the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, together with all socialist countries and other peace-loving countries, have been effectively waging an unyielding struggle for lasting peace and against war, in the past and at present.

The Government of the People's Republic of China fully agrees with the Soviet Union's proposal to eliminate the consequences of the Second World War in Europe as soon as possible, to conclude a peace treaty with Germany and to abolish the occupation regime in West Berlin. China supports the Soviet government's proposal to convene a summit conference to discuss some of the most pressing issues concerning the guarantee of peace and the security of all peoples. The People's Republic of China advocates the establishment of a collective security system in Europe and Asia, and advocates complete and thorough disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons testing.

He continued, the Soviet Union has always considered it its internationalist duty to support the just struggle of the People's Republic of China for the restoration of its rights on the international stage.

Our government has stated many times that in order to improve the international situation and establish an atmosphere of mutual trust and cooperation, it is necessary to immediately eliminate the very abnormal situation in which the legitimate rights of the 650 million Chinese people to occupy a seat in the United Nations are being brutally trampled upon.

Today, it is impossible to properly solve any major international issue without the participation of the People's Republic of China. The absence of China, this great peace-loving nation, from the United Nations is causing irreparable damage to the prestige and effectiveness of this organization, as well as to the entire cause of peace and international cooperation.

He emphasized that the Soviet Union, together with other peace-loving countries, supports the just demand of the Chinese people: to end the foreign occupation of Taiwan, which has been Chinese territory since ancient times. The stationing of American armed forces in Taiwan and the establishment of military bases there is a crude interference in China's internal affairs and a constant source of complication of the Far East situation. The Soviet Union also condemns all attempts to create "two Chinas," the purpose of which is to seize Taiwan, a province of China, and to perpetuate American occupation there. There is only one China in the world, and its capital is in Beijing.

Justice demands that Taiwan be returned to China, and there is no doubt that justice will prevail.

Zashadyko went on to say that the friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China is consolidated because our two countries are led by Communist Parties united by the common ideas of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.

The close contacts between the CPSU and the CPC, as well as the mutual visits of the leaders of the two fraternal parties, are a vivid manifestation of the ever-strengthening friendship and mutual cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. The fundamental and principled issues of the relationship between our fraternal parties are elaborated in the joint statements of our two parties and in the declarations of the fraternal parties of the socialist countries. The uncompromising ideological struggle waged by the CPSU and the CPC, together with other fraternal parties, against modern revisionism has contributed in many ways to the further strengthening of the socialist forces and the solidarity of the international communist movement.

Zashadyko also said that the socialist camp is the most loyal and reliable friend of the Asian, African, and Latin American peoples who are fighting for national independence and against colonialism. The Sino-Soviet Treaty, which guarantees peace, is not only beneficial to the socialist camp and to the peoples of our two countries, but also to the entire socialist camp and to all peoples who are fighting for world peace and security.

Zashadyko said that thanks to the unremitting efforts of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in the struggle for peace and the relaxation of international tensions, there has been a certain warming of the international situation. In this regard, the historic visit of Comrade Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, to the United States, and his talks with President Eisenhower played a particularly significant role. The Chinese people highly commend the results of Khrushchev's historic visit to the United States and his plan for complete and thorough disarmament submitted to the United Nations for discussion, as well as the resolution adopted by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on the unilateral reduction of the Soviet armed forces. The peoples of the world welcomed with great satisfaction the resolutions adopted by the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty member states at its recent meeting, aimed at further easing international tensions.

Zashadyko pointed out that the time has now come to negotiate on resolving major international disputes in order to establish lasting peace.

Zashadyko emphasized that the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all socialist countries have not forgotten that there are still forces on Earth that are very interested in continuing the arms race and the "Cold War."

In the West, the German Federal Defense Forces are equipping themselves with atomic and rocket weapons with American assistance, while in the East, the danger of the revival of Japanese militarism, the former hotbed of war and aggression, is beginning to increase. The Japanese government recently signed a new military alliance treaty with the United States. According to this treaty, foreign armed forces and military bases will remain on Japanese territory, and the Japanese government, by undertaking the obligation to increase its military potential, has openly embarked on a broad road of re-militarization. By signing a military treaty with the United States, the Japanese militarists and revanchist groups have openly revealed their intention to turn Japanese territory into a war springboard in the Far East in front of the whole world.

The Soviet Union and China, as close neighbors of Japan, hope that this country will develop along the path of peace. This is in line with Japan's own national interests and with the interests of maintaining and consolidating peace in the Far East and the world. The Soviet government, proceeding from this point, has repeatedly reminded the Japanese government of the danger of the steps it has taken to aggravate the threat of a new war.

Zashadyko pointed out that some groups in Japan are trying to find excuses to justify their own war preparations, saying that the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance threatens Japan. He said that it is well known that this treaty stipulates strictly defensive measures to prevent aggression against the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and it is not directed against Japan or any other country in the slightest. If Japan pursues a friendly and peaceful policy towards the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, it does not need to worry about the Sino-Soviet Treaty. The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have always pursued a policy of peaceful coexistence with all countries and have no intention of aggression against any country, including Japan.

Zashadyko added that the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all socialist countries are deeply concerned about maintaining lasting international peace, and they resolutely and unswervingly fight against the threat of war with the support of peace-loving forces all over the world. Consolidating world peace and ensuring peaceful coexistence among all countries with different social systems—this is the general line of the diplomatic policy of socialist countries, and the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed ten years ago is fully in line with this.

Zashadyko concluded by saying that as we celebrate the tenth Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the Soviet Union has entered the second year of the Seven-Year Plan. Full of creative enthusiasm, the Soviet people are striving with greater strength to realize the Seven-Year Plan—the magnificent program for the comprehensive development of communist construction—as soon as possible. On this momentous day of the tenth anniversary of the signing of the glorious Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Soviet people extend brotherly greetings to the great Chinese people and wish them new and great achievements in building socialism and in the struggle to strengthen peace among nations!

    扎夏迪科在莫斯科庆祝大会上指出
    中苏同盟是新型国际关系典范
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科12日讯：苏联部长会议副主席亚历山大·扎夏迪科，在莫斯科举行的中苏友好同盟互助条约签订十周年的庆祝大会上作了题为“苏中友好同盟互助条约十周年”的报告。
    他说，十年前，在人类社会的生活中发生了一件具有重大历史意义的事件。两个伟大的社会主义国家——苏联和中华人民共和国之间，为了两国人民的根本利益和世界和平事业，签订了友好同盟互助条约。
    扎夏迪科接着叙述了中苏两国人民深远的友谊，并且着重地谈到了自十月革命胜利和中华人民共和国成立以来两国人民的友好合作关系的巨大发展。
    扎夏迪科说，苏中两国之间的永久同盟和牢不可破的友谊，是社会主义阵营国家之间在列宁主义的无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上建立的崭新的国际关系的典范。苏联和中华人民共和国之间日益广泛的、全面的经济和文化合作，是我们两国的友谊日益巩固的鲜明表现。在苏中条约和协定的基础上，苏联过去和今后要帮助中华人民共和国新建和改建二百九十一个大型工业项目。我们苏联人感到高兴的是，有我们参加建设的中国工业企业，现在已经在伟大的兄弟国家经济进一步发展的事业中起着重要的作用。
    扎夏迪科强调说，苏联人民为中国劳动人民所取得的极其优异的成就而感到骄傲。为自己美好的祖国的繁荣而忘我地献出一切力量的中国人民的革命气魄和无穷的精力，对苏联人民来说是亲切的、可以理解的。我国人民非常了解，中华人民共和国人民革命的胜利和社会主义建设的成就之所以可能，是由于中国共产党的领导，由于有了以毛泽东同志为首的党中央委员会。
    扎夏迪科说，近十年来世界上所发生的不少事件令人信服地证明，苏联和中华人民共和国同所有社会主义国家和其他爱好和平的各国一道，过去和现在一直在为争取持久和平、反对战争而有效地进行不屈不挠的斗争。
    中华人民共和国政府完全赞同苏联关于尽快消除第二次世界大战在欧洲的后患、缔结对德和约和取消西柏林占领制度的建议。中国支持苏联政府关于召开最高级会议来讨论有关保障和平和各国人民的安全的一些十分迫切问题的建议。中华人民共和国主张在欧洲和亚洲建立集体安全体系，主张全面彻底裁军和禁止试验原子武器。
    他接着说，苏联过去和现在一向认为，支持中华人民共和国为恢复它在国际舞台上的权利而进行的正义斗争是自己的国际主义职责。
    我国政府曾多次声明，为了使国际局势健康化和建立互相信任和合作的气氛，必须立即消除这样一种十分不正常的局面：粗暴地践踏六亿五千万中国人民在联合国中占有席位的合法权利。
    现今，没有中华人民共和国参加就不可能妥善地解决任何一个重大国际问题。联合国中没有中国这一爱好和平的伟大国家，就给这一组织的威信和效能，以及整个和平和国际合作事业，带来不可弥补的损失。
    他强调说，苏联同其他爱好和平的国家都支持中国人民的正义要求：终止外国对自古以来的中国领土台湾的占领。美国武装部队驻扎在台湾和在那里建立军事基地，就是对中国内政的粗暴干涉，就是远东局势复杂化的经常祸根。苏联还谴责制造“两个中国”的一切企图，这种企图的目的是要把中国的一个省台湾夺走，使美国在那里的占领永久化。世界上只有一个中国，它的首都在北京。
    正义要求把台湾交还中国，毫无疑问，正义必将胜利。
    扎夏迪科接着说，苏中两国人民的友谊所以巩固，是因为我们两个国家都是由马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的共同思想团结起来的共产党所领导的。
  苏共和中共之间的密切接触以及两个兄弟党领导人的互相访问，是中华人民共和国和苏联两国日益加强的友谊和互相合作的鲜明表现。在我们两党的各项联合声明中，在社会主义国家兄弟党代表的宣言中，阐述了我们兄弟党之间相互关系的根本的、原则性的问题。苏共和中共同其他兄弟党对现代修正主义进行不妥协的思想斗争，这在很多方面有助于社会主义力量的进一步壮大和加强国际共产主义运动的团结。
    扎夏迪科又说，社会主义阵营是进行争取民族独立、反对殖民主义斗争的亚非人民和拉丁美洲人民最忠实可靠的朋友。保障和平的苏中条约不仅有利于社会主义阵营，有利于我们两国人民，而且也有利于整个社会主义阵营和一切为世界和平与安全而斗争的各国人民。
    扎夏迪科说，由于苏联和其他社会主义国家在争取和平和缓和国际紧张局势的斗争中所做的不懈努力，国际局势有了一定的转暖。在这方面，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志在美国的具有历史意义的访问，以及他和艾森豪威尔总统的会谈起了特别显著的作用。中国人民十分称赞赫鲁晓夫在美国具有历史意义的访问的结果和他提交联合国讨论的全面彻底裁军的计划，以及苏联最高苏维埃通过的关于单方面裁减苏联武装部队的决议。世界各国人民以十分满意的心情欢迎华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会在不久前的会议上通过的、旨在进一步缓和国际紧张局势的决议。
    扎夏迪科指出，现在已经到了为建立持久和平而就解决主要国际争端问题进行谈判的阶段了。
    扎夏迪科强调说，苏联、中华人民共和国和所有社会主义国家同时也没有忘记，在地球上还存在着对继续军备竞赛和“冷战”很感兴趣的势力。
    在西方，德意志联邦国防军在美国的帮助下正用原子武器和火箭武器装备自己，与此同时，在东方，前战争和侵略策源地——日本军国主义复活的危险开始增加。不久前日本政府同美国签订了新的军事同盟条约。根据这个条约，外国的武装部队和军事基地仍将留在日本的领土上，而日本政府，由于承担了增加自己军事潜力的义务，就公开走上了重新军国主义化的广阔道路。日本军国主义和复仇主义集团由于同美国签订了军事条约，从而在全世界面前公开露出了他们要把日本领土变成在远东的战争跳板的企图。
    苏联和中国，作为日本的近邻，希望这个国家沿着和平的道路发展。这样既符合日本自己的民族利益，也符合维护和巩固远东和全世界和平的利益。苏联政府从这点出发，曾经不止一次地提醒日本政府注意它所采取的加剧爆发新战争威胁的步骤的危险性。
    扎夏迪科指出，日本某些集团企图寻找借口为自己的备战活动辩护，说什么苏中友好同盟互助条约威胁着日本。他说，大家都清楚地知道，这个条约所规定的是为了防止对苏联和中华人民共和国实行侵略的严格防御性质的措施，它丝毫不同日本或其他任何国家作对。日本如果对苏联和中华人民共和国执行友好和平的政策，就不必对苏中条约担心。苏联和中华人民共和国一贯执行与一切国家和平共处的政策，对任何国家，其中包括日本，都没有任何侵略意图。
    扎夏迪科又说，苏联、中华人民共和国和一切社会主义国家深切地关怀着维护国际持久和平，他们在全世界爱好和平的力量的支持下，坚决地、始终不渝地为反对战争威胁而斗争。巩固世界和平、保证所有不同社会制度的国家和平共处——这就是社会主义国家外交政策的总路线。苏联和中华人民共和国十年前签订的友好同盟互助条约完全符合这一点。
    扎夏迪科最后说，我们庆祝苏中友好同盟互助条约签订十周年的时候，苏联已经进入了七年计划的第二年。满怀着创造性热情的苏联人民正在以更大的力量争取尽快地实现七年计划——全面展开共产主义建设的宏伟纲领。在光荣的苏中条约签订十周年的意义重大的日子里，苏联人民向伟大的中国人民致以兄弟的敬礼，并祝他们在建设社会主义和在争取加强各国之间和平的斗争中取得新的巨大的成就！
