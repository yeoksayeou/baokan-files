Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd: The new crime of U.S. imperialism attempting to plunder our precious cultural relics in Taiwan has aroused great indignation among the people of Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and other cities. Many prominent figures in cultural circles in various places have held gatherings, enthusiastically supporting the Ministry of Culture's statement on the U.S. government's conspiracy to plunder a large number of precious cultural relics of our country in Taiwan. The scholars, experts, and artists present at the meetings strongly protested against this extremely vile act of cultural aggression by U.S. imperialism, and warned U.S. imperialism to immediately stop this looting activity; the Chiang Kai-shek clique must immediately pull back from the brink and stop the illegal sale of national cultural relics.

At a meeting held by prominent figures in Shanghai's cultural circles, Jin Zhonghua exposed the U.S.'s long-standing criminal activities of attempting to plunder our country's cultural relics in Taiwan through various means. Jin Zhonghua said that the precious cultural relics in Taiwan are the property of our 650 million people, and the U.S., in collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, is attempting to plunder them, which the Chinese people absolutely cannot allow. Xu Senyu, director of the Shanghai Municipal Cultural Relics Management Committee, said that the cultural relics in Taiwan are the cultural wealth created by our people's labor over thousands of years, and the U.S. dares to attempt to plunder them, we must settle this account. Shen Zhiyu, deputy curator of the Shanghai Museum, listed a large number of facts about U.S. imperialism's unscrupulous destruction and looting of our country's precious historical relics before liberation, illustrating that U.S. imperialism has always been an enemy of destroying human cultural history. Shen Zhiyu pointed out that as early as 1954, the U.S. had sent Aschwin Lippe, the collector of Far Eastern art for the Metropolitan Museum of New York, to Taiwan to inspect our country's cultural relics there. This American ambitious person also made a catalog of these cultural relics, planning the so-called "U.S. Exhibition" plundering activity.

Prominent figures in Shanghai's cultural circles, Chen Wangdao, Zhou Gucheng, Zhou Yutong, Yang Kuan, Guo Shaoyu, Feng Zikai, Li Qingya, Tan Qixiang, Wu Ze, He Tianjian, Li Pingxin, Chen Shou'an, Jin Zhaozhi, Shen Maishi, and others, solemnly pointed out in their speeches that if our country's cultural relics in Taiwan suffer the slightest damage or loss, the U.S. government and the Chiang Kai-shek clique must bear full responsibility.

At a meeting held by cultural figures in Nanjing, Zeng Zhaoyu, director of the Nanjing Museum, expressed the strongest protest against U.S. imperialism's preparation to plunder the cultural relics of the Nanjing Museum that were stolen and transported to Taiwan by the Chiang Kai-shek clique before liberation, and declared that he would pursue the stolen goods to the end.

Han Ruilin, director of the History Department of Nanjing University, said at the meeting: U.S. imperialism has long adopted various forms to plunder a large number of our country's precious cultural relics. This time, it is using the name of "exhibition" to plunder our country's cultural relics in Taiwan to the United States. This is a plunder of the precious cultural wealth of our 650 million people, and we resolutely oppose it.

Also attending today's meeting and speaking at the meeting were representatives from Nanjing Library, Jiangsu Provincial Cultural Relics Management Committee, History Institute of the Jiangsu Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing Historical Materials Compilation Office of the Third Institute of the History Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing Academy of Arts, Preparatory Committee of the Jiangsu Branch of the Chinese Artists Association, Nanjing Municipal Cultural Relics Preservation Committee, Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Memorial Hall, Nanjing Geological Museum, and other units, including Wang Changbing, Ji Yuting, Zhou Cun, Wang Kefeng, Chen Zhifo, Fu Baoshi, and Li Xuefeng. They unanimously condemned U.S. imperialism's crime of plundering our country's cultural relics in Taiwan.

At a meeting held by cultural figures in Guangzhou, Xian Yuqing, deputy director of the Guangdong Provincial Research Institute of Culture and History, said that U.S. imperialism wants to steal a large number of our country's treasures from Taiwan, which the Chinese people cannot tolerate. These cultural relics are the crystallization of the wisdom of our working people, and must not be allowed to be stolen and transported out by the United States. Mei Binlin, a cultural relic expert who lived in the United States for more than 20 years, said: I have visited fifteen museums in major cities in the United States, and these museums all have our country's cultural relics that were plundered and stolen by U.S. imperialism. Now, U.S. imperialism is attempting to repeat the past theft under the guise of "exhibition," and the Chinese people will never allow it.

Shang Chengzuo, director of the Chinese Department of Zhongshan University and an archaeologist, said in a statement that for nearly a hundred years, U.S. imperialism has constantly plundered our country's precious cultural relics by extremely vile and shameless means. Recently, it has colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek clique in an attempt to plunder a large number of cultural relics in Taiwan. The Chinese people solemnly warn U.S. imperialism to immediately stop this looting behavior.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, February 23rd: Hong Kong and Macao patriotic newspapers published commentaries on the 22nd, enthusiastically supporting the Ministry of Culture's serious warning and statement against the U.S. government's conspiracy to plunder a large number of precious cultural relics of our country in Taiwan. All newspapers severely condemned the U.S. imperialism's despicable conspiracy to plunder our country's cultural relics in Taiwan.

The Hong Kong "Wen Wei Po" editorial said that the serious warning and statement issued by our Ministry of Culture to the U.S. government fully expresses the determination of our people to protect precious cultural relics and preserve cultural heritage. The Chinese people at home and abroad feel extremely angry about the U.S.'s theft. The editorial pointed out that the U.S.'s theft of our country's cultural relics did not begin today. In the past, countless ancient cultural relics of our country have been bought and stolen by the U.S. This time, the U.S. openly prepares to plunder a large number of precious ancient cultural relics of our country in Taiwan, which proves how greedy and shameless U.S. imperialism is. The editorial said, "If the American robbers do not withdraw their greedy hands, and if the Chiang Kai-shek clique does not stop its traitorous activities, it will only deepen the anger and hatred of our people. No matter where these precious cultural relics are plundered, the Chinese people will definitely recover them all."

The Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao" said that a large number of our cultural relics in Taiwan are representative works of our country's culture and art from past dynasties and are our country's treasures. Now, U.S. imperialism is openly colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek clique in an attempt to steal them to the United States. The Chinese people must not remain silent about this robbery.

The Hong Kong "New Evening News" commented that "In the past few decades, Americans have taken many treasures from our China, one of which is the skull of 'Peking Man' that everyone knows. In addition, some of our country's precious ancient buildings have even been moved away by the Americans in their entirety." The commentary said that now the U.S. is conspiring to take our country's cultural relics in Taiwan as its own, which the Chinese people will never allow.

The "Macao Daily News" commented that the cultural relics left over from our country's five thousand years are rare in the world and are particularly worthy of cherishing. Now, the United States is conspiring to steal our country's cultural relics in Taiwan under the guise of "exhibition," which the Chinese people cannot tolerate.

Patriotic figures in Hong Kong's cultural circles have also published statements in newspapers, enthusiastically supporting the Ministry of Culture's statement and condemning U.S. imperialism's robbery of our country's cultural relics in Taiwan.

    中山大学中文系主任、考古学家商承祚发表谈话说，近百年来，美帝国主义不断地以极端卑鄙无耻的手段掠夺我国的珍贵文物。最近，又勾结蒋介石集团企图大批劫夺在台文物，中国人民严正警告美帝国主义必须立即停止这种盗劫行为。
    新华社香港23日电　香港、澳门爱国报纸在22日纷纷发表评论，热烈拥护文化部对美国政府阴谋劫夺我国在台湾的大批珍贵文物提出严重警告和声明，各报都严厉谴责美帝国主义劫夺我国在台文物的卑鄙阴谋。

    香港“大公报”说，我国大批的在台文物，是我国历代文化艺术的代表作，是我国的瑰宝。现在美帝国主义公然勾结蒋介石集团企图盗劫到美国，对这种强盗行为，中国人民绝不能缄默。
    香港“新晚报”评论说，“过去几十年当中，美国人已经从我们中国拿去了许多瑰宝，其中之一就是大家都知道的‘北京人’的头骨。此外，我国一些珍贵的古建筑物竟有整座被美国人搬去的”。评论说，现在美国阴谋把我国在台文物据为己有，这是中国人民绝不能容许的。
    “澳门日报”评论说，我国五千年来所遗留下来的文物，是世界罕有的，是特别值得珍视的。现在美国竟借“展览”为名阴谋劫走我国在台文物，这是中国人民所不能容忍的。
