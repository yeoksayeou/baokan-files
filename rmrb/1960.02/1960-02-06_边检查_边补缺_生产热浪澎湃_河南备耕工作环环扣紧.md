Checking While Supplementing Deficiencies, Production Heats Up
Henan's Spring Preparations are Tightly Linked

This newspaper's Zhengzhou dispatch, February 5th: A surge of spring plowing and production preparations has swept across Henan province.

This year, Henan province has performed better than in previous years in winter plowing, fertilizer accumulation, and water conservancy construction. The province's winter plowing area accounts for more than 75% of the spring planting area. Among them, deep plowing of eight inches or more accounts for 83%, and 64% of spring land has been fertilized as it was plowed, and some spring fields have been winter-irrigated. Currently, the province mobilizes more than four million people daily in a professional fertilizer accumulation army, and from January 14th to 25th, it has accumulated 240 billion jin of various fertilizers, and rushed to produce 4.9 billion jin of native chemical fertilizers. Water conservancy construction achievements are particularly brilliant. According to incomplete statistics, to date, the province has completed more than 450,000 canals, more than 70,000 ponds, weirs, and dams, dug 169,000 wells, dug more than 10,000 artesian springs, and built 1,176 medium and small reservoirs. More than 30,000 river networks have been excavated in low-lying and flood-prone areas. According to statistics from 78 people's communes in 15 counties in the Kaifeng area alone, more than 10.25 million mu of cultivated land have achieved canal systematization.

In order to comprehensively prepare for spring plowing, various places have generally adopted the method of checking while supplementing deficiencies, linking each step tightly, and not allowing any slack. In mid-January, the Xuchang area convened a conference on spring plowing and spring planting preparation work. After the meeting, the entire region universally launched a major inspection, major preparation, and major comparison campaign. After basically completing the deep plowing, leveling, and fertilization of spring land, counties such as Changge, Xiangcheng, and Fugou immediately switched to raising seedlings in warm beds and greenhouses for cotton and tobacco. Currently, these three counties have established more than 600 warm houses. In the spring plowing competition campaign carried out by various communes in Qingfeng County, in order to irrigate more than 800 mu of high-lying spring land, the Gucheng Commune specifically organized a shock brigade to vigorously carry out a project to divert water to the highlands.

Various places in Henan Province have paid special attention to manufacturing and repairing spring plowing and spring planting tools and carrying out tool reform movements during spring preparations. Under the personal leadership of the commune party committee secretaries, many communes have organized a large number of skilled craftsmen from iron and woodworking factories, adopting the methods of learning from other places and conducting in-depth research in the fields with commune members, and reformed and created many advanced tools that require fewer people, are more efficient, and can perform multiple tasks with one tool. The "intertillage fertilizer applicator" reformed by the Yucheng Commune in Yongcheng County can intertill and fertilize 100 mu of land a day with one animal and two people, which is more than 30 times more efficient than using a two-tooth cultivator. Various places have also vigorously promoted field railization and shipping according to local conditions. Shangqiu County has laid more than 3,000 li of "wood-brick combined" field rails, and has delivered 3 billion jin of fertilizer to spring land.

While preparing for spring plowing, various places have also planned land and established high-yield plots based on the characteristics of different crops.

    边检查　边补缺　生产热浪澎湃 
    河南备耕工作环环扣紧
    本报郑州5日电　备耕生产热潮已席卷河南全省。
    今年，河南省的冬翻、积肥、兴修水利，做得比往年都好。全省冬耕面积占春播面积的75％以上。其中，深耕八寸以上的占83％，并有64％春地随耕随施入了底肥，还有部分春田进行了冬灌。目前，全省每天出动四百多万人专业积肥大军，从元月14日到25日，已积各种肥料二千四百亿斤，并赶制土化肥四十九亿斤。水利建设成就尤为辉煌，据不完全统计，到目前止，全省已完成渠道四十五万多条，塘、堰、坝七万多处，打井十六万九千眼，打自流泉一万多处，修中、小型水库一千一百七十六座。低洼易涝区已开挖河网三万多条。仅据开封专区十五个县的七十八个人民公社统计，已有一千零二十五多万亩耕地实现了渠道系统化。
    各地为了全面做好备耕工作，普遍采取边检查、边补缺的办法，环环扣紧，步步不让。许昌专区在元月中旬就召开了春耕春播准备工作会议。会后，全区普遍开展了大检查、大准备、大评比运动。长葛、襄城、扶沟等县在基本结束春地深翻、平整、施肥以后，立即转入了棉花、烟叶的温床温室育苗。现在，这三个县已经建立了六百多间温房。清丰县各公社在开展备耕评比运动中，固城公社为了让八百多亩高岗春地也浇上水，特组织一支突击队，大搞引水上岗工程。
    河南省各地在备耕中特别注意制造、修补春耕、春播工具和开展工具改革运动。许多公社在社党委书记亲自领导下，组织了大批铁、木业工厂的能工巧匠，采取到外地学习和深入田间同社员共同研究的办法，改制和创造了许多用人少效率高、一具做多活的先进工具。永城县?城公社改制的“中耕施肥器”，一畜两人一天可中耕地、施肥一百亩，比使用二齿中耕器提高工效三十倍以上。各地还因地制宜地大搞田间轨道化和航运化。商丘县已铺设“木砖合制”田间轨道三千多里，已为春地送肥三十亿斤。
    在备耕的同时，各地都根据不同作物的性能，规划了土地和建立了丰产方。
