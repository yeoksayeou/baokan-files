    Deep as the Sea
    Li Sulan, Worker at Shanghai State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 7

    On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the signing of the great Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, many exciting events have vividly reappeared before my eyes.

    Four months ago, I participated in the Shanghai Youth Delegation and visited Leningrad for eleven days and stayed in Moscow for four days at the invitation of the Leningrad City Committee of the Soviet Komsomol. These short fifteen days left an extremely deep impression in my heart. I not only saw a more beautiful tomorrow for our motherland from the Soviet Union's present, but I was also greatly encouraged by the soaring enthusiasm of Soviet youth. At the same time, the Soviet people's warm reception and selfless assistance to us also made me never forget. At the Kirov Yarn Combine Factory in Leningrad, I added a lot of trouble to my Soviet counterparts. This is a highly automated factory with many things worth learning. As a fine yarn doffer, I was particularly interested in the automatic fine yarn cleaning machine and became more and more fascinated as I watched it. It can automatically suck and blow all the flying cotton from top to bottom on the machine, making it clean. With it, the labor intensity is greatly reduced and the labor productivity is improved. This is truly good news for doffers and a revolution in textile technology! In order to ensure that our factory can also have such a machine in the future, I went to the Kirov factory twice to learn, and each time I received enthusiastic help from the Soviet comrades. They patiently explained the principle of the mechanism, led me to visit, and finally gave me all the drawings. When I left this factory, a chorus of voices, sending greetings to Chinese workers, Shanghai workers, and the brothers and sisters of our factory, was boiling in my ears. Many sisters were even in tears, reluctant to part. At that time, I thought: Having such a good elder brother is truly our glory and pride. I must live up to the expectations of the elder brother and bring all the things I have learned back to share with everyone. Now, under the leadership of the Party and with the cooperation of all parties, our factory has basically installed the first automatic cleaning machine according to the drawings given to us by the Kirov factory. The effect is very good, and the comrades cherish it and regard it as a symbol of the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, the Kirov factory, and our factory.

    During my visit to Leningrad, it was the season of severe cold, with snowflakes fluttering. I originally had a stomachache problem, and if I wasn't careful, it flared up again. During the few days I was sick, doctors and nurses took care of me around the clock, and Comrade Smirnova, the person in charge of the International Liaison Department of the Leningrad Komsomol Municipal Committee, also personally braved the heavy snow to buy medicine for me late at night. A little problem caused a lot of trouble for the hosts, and I was really a little embarrassed, but my dear friends repeatedly said: "As long as you get well, it will be our greatest pleasure!" This is not only concern for me personally, but a concrete manifestation of the Soviet people's heart-to-heart connection with the Chinese people. I want to cheer for the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, which is deeper than the sea, and I want to cheer for the close unity between China and the Soviet Union!

    情深似海
    上海国棉七厂工人　李素兰
    在伟大的中苏友好同盟互助条约签订十周年纪念日的前夕，许多激动人心的往事，又清清楚楚地浮现在我的面前。
    四个月以前，我参加了上海青年代表团，应苏联共青团列宁格勒市委会的邀请，在列宁格勒访问了十一天，在莫斯科停留了四天。这短短的十五天，在我的心里留下了极为深刻的印象。我不但从苏联的今天，看到了祖国更加美好的明天，而且也从苏联青年的冲天干劲，受到很大的鼓舞。同时，苏联人民对我们的盛情接待和无私的帮助，也使我永远不能忘记。在列宁格勒基洛夫纱线联合工厂，我给我的苏联同行们，增添了不少麻烦。这是一座高度自动化的工厂，有许多值得学习的东西。作为细纱挡车工，我对细纱自动清洁机格外感到兴趣，越看越入迷。它能自动地从上到下把机器上的全部飞花吸吹得干干净净。有了它，大大减低了劳动强度，提高了劳动生产率。这真是挡车工的大福音，纺织技术的大革命！为了使我们工厂将来也能有这样的机器，我二次到了基洛夫工厂学习，每一次都受到苏联同志们的热情帮助。他们耐心地讲解机构原理，领我参观，最后又把全部图纸送给我。当我离开这个工厂的时候，一片向中国工人、上海工人和我们厂工人兄弟姊妹问好的声音，在我的耳边沸腾。许多姊妹们甚至热泪滚滚，难舍难分。当时我想：有这样好的老大哥，真是我们的光荣和骄傲，我一定不辜负老大哥的期望，把全部学到的东西，都带回去传播给大家。现在，在党的领导和各方面的配合下，我们厂已经基本上按照基洛夫工厂送给我们的图样，装上了第一台自动清洁机，效果很好，同志们都珍爱它，把它看作中苏两国人民、基洛夫工厂和我厂友谊的象征。
    在列宁格勒访问时，正是严寒季节，雪花飘飘。我本来有胃痛毛病，一不注意，又发作了。在生病的几天中，医生护士日夜围在床前照顾我，连列宁格勒共青团市委国际联络部负责同志斯密诺娃同志也亲自深夜冒着大雪给我买药。一点点毛病，给主人招来不少麻烦，真有些不好意思，但是我亲爱的朋友们却再三说：“只要你的病好了，就是我们最大的愉快！”这不仅是对我一个人的关心，这是苏联人民跟中国人民心连心的具体表现。我要为中苏人民比海还深的友谊欢呼，我要为中苏两国的亲密团结欢呼！
