Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 18th: U.S. President Eisenhower, at a press conference in Washington on the 17th, once again used the issue of the United States purchasing Cuban sugar to put pressure on Cuba.

Answering a question about the recent trade and loan agreement signed between Cuba and the Soviet Union, Eisenhower deliberately slandered this agreement, which was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the Cuban people. He also indicated that the U.S. authorities "might" revise the treaty between the U.S. and Cuba regarding the purchase of sugar. This is another arrogant statement of interference by the U.S. government following the statement by the U.S. Embassy in Cuba on the 13th.

Despite the U.S.'s unbridled interference in the Cuban revolution and its repeated use of the "economic sanctions" cudgel on the sugar import issue against Cuba, Eisenhower in this talk attacked the U.S.'s "traditional economic relations with Cuba have been abandoned, disrupted, or changed by the Cubans in recent months," portraying the U.S.'s vicious policy of interference as "treating the Cuban people fairly and not taking any action detrimental to them."

At the press conference, Eisenhower also expressed an attitude of indulgence toward France's explosion of an atomic device. He stated that it was "perfectly natural" and "understandable" for France to "do so."

Eisenhower said that the United States is "carefully studying" the Soviet Union's new proposal at the Geneva conference on the discontinuance of nuclear weapons testing regarding standards for sending investigative teams to detect phenomena suspected of being underground tests, but he also said that determining a limit to the number of inspections per year "will be difficult."

    利用食糖问题作干涉手段
    美国总统对古巴施加压力
    新华社18日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔17日在华盛顿记者招待会上再次利用美国购买古巴食糖问题对古巴施加压力。
    艾森豪威尔在回答关于古巴同苏联最近签订的贸易和贷款协定的问题时，故意毁谤这个受到古巴广大人民热烈欢迎的协定。他同时表明，美国当局“或许”要修改美国同古巴之间关于购买食糖的条约。这是继美国驻古巴大使馆13日声明之后美国官方的又一次蛮横干涉的声明。
    尽管美国对古巴革命进行肆无忌惮的干涉，并且一再利用食糖进口问题对古巴挥舞“经济制裁”的大棒，艾森豪威尔在这次谈话中却反而攻击美国同古巴“传统的经济关系在最近几个月中被古巴人废弃、扰乱、或者改变”，他把美国凶恶的干涉政策说成是“对古巴人民公正相待，而且没有采取任何对他们有损害的行动”。
    艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上还对法国爆炸原子装置一事表示了纵容的态度。他表示，法国“这样做完全是自然的事情”，“是可以理解的”。
    艾森豪威尔说，美国正“仔细研究”苏联在日内瓦不继续试验核武器会议上提出的关于派遣调查组侦察有地下试验嫌疑现象的标准问题的新建议，但是他又说，要确定每年侦察次数的限额“将是困难的”。
