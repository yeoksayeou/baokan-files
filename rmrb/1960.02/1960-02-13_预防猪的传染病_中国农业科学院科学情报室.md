    Preventing Swine Infectious Diseases
    China Academy of Agricultural Sciences Scientific and Technical Information Institute
    Swine infectious diseases are the most serious threat to the pig-raising industry. The most common swine infectious diseases are hog cholera, swine enzootic pneumonia, swine erysipelas, swine fever, piglet paratyphoid, and piglet white scours.
    The occurrence and prevalence of swine infectious diseases have certain patterns, and each has different epidemic characteristics. In terms of epidemic season, hog cholera can occur in all seasons, swine erysipelas often occurs in summer, while swine enzootic pneumonia is prone to occur in winter. In terms of the source of the disease, hog cholera and swine enzootic pneumonia are caused by filterable viruses, while swine erysipelas, swine fever, and piglet paratyphoid are caused by bacteria. In terms of the age of infection, hog cholera, swine enzootic pneumonia, etc. can infect pigs of all ages, paratyphoid mostly affects piglets, while piglet white scours is limited to suckling pigs.
    According to the source of infection, occurrence, and prevalence patterns of swine diseases, the following aspects should be noted in prevention and control work:
    First, implement the policy of self-breeding and self-raising. If it is necessary to import pigs from other places, they must be imported from areas or pig farms that are definitely free of swine diseases. After import, they should be quarantined and raised separately, carefully observed for a period, and only put into the pig herd after a final check confirms that they are disease-free.
    Second, reasonably divide groups, graze in separate areas, and implement collective pen feeding. The number of heads per pen should not be too many to avoid crowding and reduce contact opportunities.
    Third, strengthen feeding management, keep pig houses clean and dry, and maintain pig body hygiene. In hot weather, pig houses should be cool; in winter, attention should be paid to both keeping pig houses warm and maintaining air circulation. It is necessary to achieve warmth in winter and coolness in summer, and also to frequently clean and pad the pens and change the bedding grass frequently; pig houses and feed troughs should be disinfected regularly. For viral infectious diseases such as hog cholera, the economically effective disinfectant is 2% caustic soda, plus 3% lime milk, which can be used to disinfect pig pens, feed troughs, utensils, and transportation vehicles; for swine erysipelas and swine fever, 3% creosol solution, hot caustic soda solution, or 3% hot wood ash solution can be used for disinfection, and the effect is also very good. On warm, windless days in cold weather and cool mornings and evenings in hot weather, pigs can be released for exercise to enhance their physical fitness. Feed should be reasonably allocated, and attention should be paid to supplementing bone meal and crushed eggshells, salt, and other mineral feeds, and try to feed more green feed in winter. If conditions permit, earth-made antibiotics can be added to the feed, which can promote pig growth and prevent diseases.
    Fourth, comprehensive preventive vaccination. Vaccination is a positive and effective way to prevent swine infectious diseases. The rabbit-adapted hog cholera attenuated vaccine successfully developed in our country is safe and effective, and the immunity period can be maintained for more than one year. One injection for fattening pigs can provide lifelong immunity. For the prevention of swine erysipelas, there are swine erysipelas aluminum hydroxide formaldehyde vaccine and attenuated vaccine. There are also swine fever vaccine and swine paratyphoid vaccine for the prevention of swine fever and swine paratyphoid, respectively.
    Fifth, pay attention to the health of pigs. Early diagnosis should be made, and sick pigs and suspected infectious disease pigs should be immediately isolated, raised by special personnel, and pig pens, feed troughs, utensils, etc. should be thoroughly disinfected. Grazing grounds should be stopped from grazing, and the carcasses of dead pigs should be strictly disinfected and disposed of.
    Sixth, pay attention to the disinfection of incoming and outgoing personnel and vehicles at ordinary times. Disinfection should be serious and not be a mere formality; resolutely prevent other poultry and livestock from roaming around. The feeders of epidemic farms or epidemic groups should not visit healthy farms or healthy pig groups.
    Seventh, regarding the treatment of pig manure, set up manure pits or piles in places far away from the pig pens, cover them with mud, and let them ferment and generate heat to kill the source of the disease.
    Eighth, feed troughs should be covered when not feeding, and feed should be properly stored to avoid contamination by viruses or bacteria carried by rats, birds, flies, etc.
    Regarding the treatment of swine infectious diseases, in addition to the application of immune serum, antibiotics, sulfa drugs, etc., folk veterinarians and the masses have very rich experience and methods, and there are also many effective prescriptions in various places. The important issue is to mobilize the masses and rely on the masses.
    There are many causes of pig diseases, but improper feeding management and poor sanitary conditions are often the main reasons. In order to ensure the high-speed development of the pig-raising industry, it is necessary to strengthen pig feeding management, pay attention to hygiene, carry out mass pig disease prevention and control campaigns, resolutely implement comprehensive prevention and control measures, and strive to eliminate pig diseases.

    预防猪的传染病
    中国农业科学院科学情报室
    猪的传染病对养猪事业危害最为严重。最常见的猪传染病有猪瘟、猪喘气病、猪丹毒、猪肺疫、幼猪副伤寒和仔猪白痢。
    猪传染病的发生和流行都有一定的规律，又各有不同的流行特点。就流行季节来说，猪瘟一年四季都可发生，猪丹毒多发生在夏季，而冬季则容易发生猪喘气病。就病源来说，猪瘟、猪喘气病是由滤过性病毒引起的，猪丹毒、猪肺疫、猪副伤寒是病菌所致。就感染年龄来说，猪瘟、猪喘气病等不论大小猪都可感染，副伤寒多侵害小猪，而仔猪白痢仅限于吃奶的猪。
    根据猪疫的传染来源、发生和流行的规律，在防治工作中，需要注意以下几个方面：
    一，贯彻自繁自养的方针。如需从外地引进猪，一定要从确无猪疫的地区或猪场输入。输入后单独隔离饲养，认真观察一个时期，经最后检查确实无病时，才可放入猪群。
    二，合理分群，分区放牧，实行集体分圈饲养。每圈头数不宜过多，避免拥挤，减少接触机会。
    三，加强饲养管理，保持猪舍清洁、干燥和猪体卫生。热天，猪舍要凉爽；冬季，既要注意猪舍保暖，又要保持空气流通。要做到冬暖夏凉，还要勤起圈、垫圈，勤换褥草；猪舍、饲槽定期消毒。对病毒性传染病如猪瘟，经济有效的消毒药为2％烧碱，加3％的生石灰乳，可用于消毒猪圈、饲槽、用具和运输工具；对猪丹毒、猪肺疫可用3％臭药水，用热烧碱水或3％热草木灰水消毒，效果也很好。冷天日暖无风时，热天早晚凉爽时，可把猪放出运动，增强猪的体质。饲料要合理调配，注意补充骨粉和捣碎的鸡蛋壳、食盐等矿物质饲料，冬天设法多喂青绿饲料。有条件的可以加喂土制抗菌素，既可促进猪生长，又可预防疾病。
    四，全面预防注射。注射疫苗是预防猪传染病积极有效的办法。我国研究成功的兔化猪瘟弱毒疫苗安全有效，免疫期可维持一年以上，肥育猪打一针可终身免疫。预防猪丹毒有猪丹毒氢氧化铝甲醛疫苗和弱毒疫苗。预防猪肺疫和猪副伤寒也分别有猪肺疫菌苗和猪副伤寒菌苗。
    五，注意猪的健康。要早期诊断，发现病猪和可疑的传染病病猪，立即隔离，专人饲养，彻底消毒猪圈、饲槽、用具等，放牧场要停止放牧，病死的猪尸体严加消毒处理。
    六，平时注意出入人员、车辆的消毒，消毒要认真，不能流于形式；坚决不让其它禽畜乱串。疫场或疫群的饲养员不要到健康场或健康猪群去参观。
    七，关于猪粪便处理。在距离猪圈较远的地方设粪坑或堆成堆，外面糊泥，让其发酵生热杀死病源。
    八，食槽在不喂时要加盖，饲料妥加保藏，避免因鼠、鸟、蝇等带病毒或病菌污染。
    关于猪传染病的治疗，除应用兔疫血清、抗菌素、磺胺等药外，民间兽医和群众都有很丰富的经验和办法，各地也有不少有效药方，重要问题在于发动群众依靠群众。
    猪的发病原因很多，但是饲养管理不当和卫生条件差往往是主要原因。为了保证养猪事业高速度发展，必须加强猪的饲养管理，注意卫生，开展群众性防治猪病运动，坚决贯彻综合性防治措施，力争消灭猪病。
