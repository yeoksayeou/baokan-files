Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 2nd: Since December of last year, factories, mines, ports, and stations in Hubei Province have reformed transportation and loading/unloading tools based on the principles of self-reliance and combining indigenous and foreign methods, achieving significant results.

According to incomplete statistics from 103 large and small ports, within half a month, they have reformed and manufactured more than 650 uphill and downhill tools, hoisting tools, and more than 2,200 transportation vehicles, repaired 72 indigenous wharves, 35 working roads, and expanded cargo yards by 107. Among them, the main wharves of 51 medium-sized and larger ports have achieved the use of vehicles for flat ground transportation, cable cars, chain conveyor belts, and belt conveyors for slopes, chutes for downhill, and derricks for hoisting, basically eliminating carrying on shoulders and backs, greatly improving handling and loading/unloading efficiency, and shortening the berthing time of ships. For example, the average berthing time of ships on the Han River in early December last year was 5.12 days, which has been shortened to 3.13 days in early January this year.

In Shashi, 83% of factories have fully utilized vehicles, slides, cables, and derricks to replace manual labor for loading, unloading, and transportation within the factories; the proportion of workers engaged in heavy physical labor such as carrying, lifting, and shouldering in the city has decreased from 21.4% to 7.9%.

Workers at the Hubei Tractor Factory in Wuhan used iron rails to lay a transportation network, connecting the material warehouse, processing workshop, semi-finished product warehouse, and final assembly workshop, ensuring the timely supply of raw materials and the smooth transfer of semi-finished products; each workshop also used waste and old materials to make more than 40 vehicles of different shapes for internal transportation, enabling all transportation and loading/unloading workers in the factory to put down their carrying poles and ropes, and saving more than 40 handling workers to support other departments.

Currently, the transportation and loading/unloading tool reform movement on the industrial and transportation front in Hubei Province will continue to be carried out comprehensively. All relevant parties regard the development of this movement as a major measure to complete the 1960 Great Leap Forward plan, vigorously mobilizing the masses to conscientiously implement the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the main focus, and progressing from indigenous to foreign, to reform transportation and loading/unloading tools, gradually achieving the basic elimination of heavy labor such as carrying, lifting, and shouldering, and greatly improving labor productivity.

    平地用车运　起坡用缆车　下坡用溜具　起重用吊杆
    湖北许多码头消灭肩挑背驮
    新华社武汉2日电　湖北省许多工厂、矿山、港口、车站本着自力更生、土洋结合的原则，从去年12月份起改革运输装卸工具，取得了很大成绩。
    据一百零三个大小港口的不完全统计，他们在半个月内已经改革、制造了六百五十多件上坡下坡工具、起重工具和二千二百多部运输车辆，修造土码头七十二处、作业道路三十五条，扩大货场一百零七处。其中，五十一个中等以上的港口的主要码头，已经实现平地运输用车子，起坡用缆车、链板运输机和皮带运输机，下坡用溜具，起重用吊杆，基本上消灭了肩挑背驮，大大提高了搬运、装卸效率，缩短了船舶泊港时间。如汉江上的轮船，去年12月上旬平均泊港时间是五点一二天，今年1月上旬已缩短到三点一三天。
    沙市有83％的工厂已全部利用车子、滑板、滑丝、吊杆代替人力进行厂内的装卸、运输工作；全市从事挑、抬、扛等笨重体力劳动的工人占工人总数的比重，已从21．4％下降到7．9％。
    武汉市湖北拖拉机厂职工用铁轨铺设了一个运输网，将材料库、加工车间、半成品库、总装车间联接起来，保证了原料材料的及时供应和半成品的顺利转移；各车间还利用废料旧料做了四十多辆不同形状的车子，用于车间内部运输，使全厂运输、装卸工人全部放下了扁担绳子，并且节省出四十多个搬运工人支援其他部门。
    目前，湖北省工业交通战线上运输装卸工具改革运动还要继续全面开展。各有关方面都把开展这一运动当做完成1960年跃进计划的重大措施，大力发动群众认真贯彻土洋结合、以土为主、由土到洋的方针，来改革运输装卸工具，逐步做到基本消灭挑、抬、扛等笨重劳动，大大提高劳动生产率。
