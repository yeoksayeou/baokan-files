Xinhua News Agency, Havana, February 18th: A plane piloted by Americans crashed this morning while attempting to bomb the Spanish sugar mill in Matanzas province, after the bombs exploded before being dropped. Both personnel on board were killed in the explosion. One, identified as Robert Ellis Frost, a member of the U.S. Federal Civil Defense Administration, the other was unidentifiable. This incident completely exposes the U.S.'s crime of armed aggression against Cuba.

The Spanish sugar mill was recently transferred to the National Land Reform Commission by the Ministry of Recovered Stolen Property.

Cuban authorities also seized a map from the crashed plane, marking the location of another sugar mill that these two men were to bomb. Since the middle of last year, planes from the United States have repeatedly bombed Cuban sugar mills and sugarcane fields. Recently, attempts to burn sugarcane fields have intensified. Today, newspapers reported that a plane from the United States dropped incendiary bombs, setting fire to 300,000 arrobas (one arroba equals 11.338 kilograms - editor's note) of sugarcane in the Porfuerza sugar mill.

The National Union of Sugar Workers revealed that counter-revolutionaries are cooperating with aerial invaders from the ground, setting fire to 500,000 arrobas of sugarcane at the Gomez sugar mill.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, February 19th: Cuban Prime Minister Castro said in a television program this morning that the revolutionary government now has solid evidence proving that the planes setting fire to sugarcane fields and bombing Cuban territory are from the United States.

Speaking about the American plane that exploded in the air on the morning of the 18th while attempting to bomb the Spanish sugar mill, Castro showed the maps seized by the Cuban government from the flight crew to the audience. These maps prove that the invaders came from a base in Miami, Florida, located at 25 degrees 17 minutes north latitude and 80 degrees 53 minutes west longitude, 67 miles northwest of the U.S. Homestead Naval Base, and 30 miles from the Homestead Air Force Base.

Castro said that the seized maps confirm that another base for attacking Cuba is located at 25 degrees 18 minutes north latitude and 80 degrees 50 minutes west longitude, 77 miles northwest of the U.S. Key West base, and 20 miles southeast of the Homestead base. The maps marked the flight route of the plane that attacked the Spanish sugar mill.

Castro said that one of the two pilots on the plane has been identified as Robert Ellis Frost. Castro then showed the audience the American passport and U.S. Federal Civil Defense Administration credentials of this pilot. The documents indicate that Robert Ellis Frost was a member of the crew.

Castro said that the notebooks of the two pilots prove that they were also responsible for the air raids on Cuba on the 3rd, 15th, and 17th of this month, taking off from a base near Miami. The seized maps prove that they also bombed the Hershey sugar mill, the Alegre Point sugar mill, the Adelaide sugar mill, the Niagara sugar mill, as well as other sugar mills in Yaguajay and Hatillo Bonito. During one of their flights yesterday, they also attempted to bomb the Soledad sugar mill. The seized maps prove that they were also planning to bomb all the sugar mills in Havana province and some sugar mills in Camagüey province, Pinar del Río province, and Las Villas province in the future. The starting points of the flight routes marked on the map are all U.S. bases.

Castro said that there have been more than 30 (airplane) attacks on Cuba, and more than 19.3 million arrobas (one arroba equals 11.338 kilograms - editor's note) of sugarcane have been burned, which is the most poisonous thing to the relationship between the United States and Cuba.

Castro condemned these attacks as "savage acts." He said that the Cuban government is prepared to provide the evidence to the U.S. authorities.

When answering questions about the trade agreement between Cuba and the Soviet Union, Prime Minister Castro said that this agreement is "extremely beneficial" to Cuba. He said: Cuban-Soviet trade will give Cuba a 20% surplus. He pointed out that, in contrast, Cuba's trade settlements with the United States have a deficit, reaching ten billion U.S. dollars in the last ten years.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, February 17th: Cuba's "July 26th Movement" organ, "Revolución," published an editorial today condemning the shameless aggression clamor of U.S. military personnel against Cuba. According to the newspaper, U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Bryant recently requested that Congress allocate $122.2 million in military construction funds to deal with the so-called "communist threat" near the United States. Bryant falsely claimed that there are problems in the Caribbean region that could lead to an "invasion" of the U.S. coast. While criticizing Bryant's aggression clamor, "Revolución" pointed out that U.S. authorities and the U.S. president, on the one hand, say that they want to resolve the difficulties arising from their refusal to recognize our right to govern ourselves through diplomatic negotiations, and on the other hand, promote threatening military plans. The newspaper said that the increase in military appropriations in the U.S. budget is not for defense but for aggression, which is a serious event that threatens world peace.

    美国武装侵略古巴铁证如山
    古巴缴获的物件证实了空中罪犯是美国军人
    卡斯特罗谴责美国飞机轰炸古巴的野蛮行动
    新华社哈瓦那18日电　由美国人驾驶的一架飞机，今天早晨在企图轰炸马坦萨斯省的西班牙糖厂时，由于炸弹在投下之前爆炸而坠毁。飞机里的两个人员都在爆炸中毙命，其中一个经辨明是美国联邦民防署的成员罗伯特·艾利斯·弗罗斯特，另一个已无法辨认。这一事件彻底暴露了美国武装侵略古巴的罪行。
    西班牙糖厂是最近由恢复失窃财产部转交给土地改革全国委员会的。
    古巴当局还在坠毁的飞机中缴获了一份地图，这份地图标明了这两个人要去轰炸的另一个糖厂的位置。从去年年中以来，来自美国的飞机曾多次轰炸古巴的糖厂和甘蔗田。最近以来，焚毁甘蔗园的企图更变本加厉了。各报今天报道，一架来自美国的飞机投下了燃烧弹，使波尔富埃萨糖厂中的三十万阿罗瓦（一阿罗瓦等于十一点三三八公斤——编者）的甘蔗着起火来。
    全国糖业工人联合会揭露，反革命分子从地面上与空中侵略者配合，纵火焚烧了戈麦斯糖厂的五十万阿罗瓦的甘蔗。
    新华社哈瓦那19日电　古巴总理卡斯特罗在今天早晨的电视节目中说，革命政府现在拥有的确凿证据，证明纵火焚烧甘蔗田和轰炸古巴领土的飞机是从美国来的。
    在谈到18日晨企图轰炸西班牙糖厂而在空中爆炸的那架美国飞机时，卡斯特罗拿出被古巴政府缴获的飞行人员所携带的地图给大家看。这些地图证明，侵略者来自美国佛罗里达州迈阿密的一个基地，它位于北纬二十五度十七分，西经八十度五十三分，西北距离美国后姆斯台德海军基地六十七英里，距离后姆斯台德的空军基地三十英里。
    卡斯特罗说，被缴获的地图证实，另外一个进攻古巴的基地位于北纬二十五度十八分，西经八十度五十分，西北距离美国基韦斯特基地七十七英里，东南距后姆斯台德基地二十英里。地图标明了袭击西班牙糖厂的这架飞机的飞行路线。
    卡斯特罗说，飞机上两个飞行员有一个已经查明是罗伯特·艾利斯·弗罗斯特。卡斯特罗随即拿出这个飞行员的美国护照和美国联邦民防署的证明文件给大家看。证件说明，罗伯特·艾利斯·弗罗斯特是该机的成员。
    卡斯特罗说，这两个飞行员的记事本证明，本月3日、15日和17日对古巴的空袭也是他们干的，起飞地点是美国迈阿密城附近的一个基地。被缴获的地图证明，他们还轰炸过赫尔塞糖厂、阿莱格雷角糖厂、阿德拉伊达糖厂、尼亚加拉糖厂以及雅瓜哈依和哈蒂沃尼科两个地方的其他糖厂。他们在昨天的一次飞行中，还企图轰炸索莱达德糖厂。被缴获的地图证明他们还准备在以后轰炸哈瓦那省的所有糖厂和卡马圭省、比那尔德里奥省和拉斯维利亚斯省的一些糖厂，地图上所标明的飞行路线的起点都是美国的基地。
    卡斯特罗说，对古巴的（飞机）袭击已经有三十多次了，被烧毁的甘蔗超过一千九百三十万阿罗瓦（一阿罗瓦等于十一点三三八公斤——编者），这是最毒化美国同古巴两国关系的事情。
    卡斯特罗谴责这些袭击是“野蛮的行动”。他说，古巴政府准备把证据提供给美国当局。
    卡斯特罗总理在回答关于古巴同苏联签订的贸易协定的问题时说，这个协定对古巴是“极为有利的”。他说：古苏贸易将使古巴有20％的顺差。他指出，与此相反，古巴同美国的贸易结算有逆差，最近十年中的逆差达十亿美元。
    新华社哈瓦那17日电　古巴“7月26日运动”机关报“革命报”今天发表社论，谴责美国军事人员对古巴发出的无耻侵略叫嚣。据这家报纸报道，美国助理国防部长布莱恩特最近曾要求国会拨出一亿二千二百万美元的军事工程用款，用来对付所谓靠近美国的“共产主义的威胁”。布莱恩特诬蔑说，在加勒比海地区存在着一些问题，这些问题可能导致对美国海岸的“入侵”。“革命报”在抨击布莱恩特的侵略叫嚣时指出，美国当局和美国总统一方面说什么要通过外交谈判解决由于他们拒绝承认我们治理自己国家的权利而产生的困难，一方面又宣扬威胁性的军事计划。报纸说，美国预算中军事拨款的增加并不是为了防御，而是为了侵略，这是威胁世界和平的严重事件。
