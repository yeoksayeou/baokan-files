Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang - Guizhou Province is stepping up the construction of its railway network to further change its isolated transportation situation.

The province's railway construction is centered on Guiyang City. The main lines currently under construction include the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway to Sichuan Province and the Yunnan-Guizhou Railway to Yunnan Province. The Guizhou section of the Hunan-Guizhou Railway has also recently begun construction. In addition to the main lines, dozens of branch lines and dedicated lines, totaling more than 200 kilometers in length, are also under construction.

Railway construction workers are displaying soaring revolutionary vigor and are stubbornly fighting against high mountains and swift rivers. Their slogan is: "Not afraid of river waves, not afraid of the Miao Mountains and Lou Mountains being higher than the sky, we wield our mountain-opening axes, and we will make the high mountains bow their heads and turn into plains." The people of all ethnic groups in Guizhou have given very enthusiastic support to railway construction.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, February 13th - Workers constructing the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway tunnel successfully opened the No. 1 Sijiaoyan Tunnel on February 10th. So far, all pilot tunnels on the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway have been opened.

A total of 65 tunnels, with a total length of 27 kilometers, need to be built on the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway. Liangfengya Tunnel, the longest tunnel in China at present, is on the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway line.

    贵州赶建铁路网
    誓把高山急水变通途
    据新华社贵阳电　贵州省正在加紧建设铁路网，进一步改变交通闭塞的面貌。
    全省的铁路建设以贵阳市为中心。目前正在加紧施工的干线，有通往四川省的川黔线和通往云南省的滇黔线，湘黔线贵州境内一段也已在最近开始施工。除了干线以外，还有共长二百多公里的几十条支线和专用线在建设。
    筑路职工发挥冲天的革命干劲，顽强地向高山恶水展开斗争。他们的口号是：“不怕河水波浪翻，不怕苗岭娄山高过天，咱们挥动开山斧，管叫高山低头变平川。”贵州各族人民对于铁路建设，给予了非常热情的支援。
    据新华社贵阳13日电　修建川黔铁路隧道的工人，在2月10日胜利打通了四角岩一号隧道。至此，川黔铁路上，全部隧道已打通导坑。
    川黔铁路共需修建六十五座共长二十七公里的隧道。我国目前最长的一条隧道——凉风垭隧道，就在川黔铁路线上。
