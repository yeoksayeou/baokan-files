Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 7th: Japanese newspapers "Yomiuri Shimbun" and "Mainichi Shimbun," in their commentaries on the Sino-Myanmar Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression and the Sino-Myanmar Boundary Agreement, both emphasized the great significance of the treaty and the agreement.

"Yomiuri Shimbun" published a commentary on February 1st, stating, "What is noteworthy in the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression is that it thoroughly implements the spirit of the Five Principles. Especially noteworthy are the following two points: 1. Both sides guarantee to resolve all disputes between them through peaceful consultation, without resorting to force; 2. The two contracting parties guarantee non-aggression and will not participate in military alliances directed against the other party."

The newspaper pointed out, regarding the Sino-Myanmar Boundary Agreement, that the complex boundary issue was resolved merely after a five-day meeting between Zhou Enlai and Ne Win.

"Mainichi Shimbun" published a commentary on January 30th, stating that the treaty and agreement signed between China and Myanmar "seem to have epoch-making significance." It said that this will "open up a new situation in the very turbulent Himalayan region since the Sino-Indian border dispute."

"Mainichi Shimbun" also published a dispatch from Hong Kong by special correspondent Takada on February 1st, again commenting on the Sino-Myanmar Treaty and Agreement. This dispatch made many subjective speculations about China's policies, but it admitted the far-reaching significance of the treaty and agreement. It said that this is the first non-aggression treaty China has signed with a foreign country, "a noteworthy diplomatic measure."

The newspaper said that China's plan for "peaceful coexistence based on non-aggression" had also been proposed to Kenzō Matsumura; moreover, it had also proposed establishing a Pacific collective security system including the United States, Japan, and the Soviet Union as its Asian diplomatic policy. However, it is believed that the fact that China and the Ne Win government, in addition to establishing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, have taken a step forward in the form of a "treaty" by signing a non-aggression treaty will have a considerable impact on the views of Southeast Asian countries towards China.

    中缅条约贯彻五项原则精神
    日本“每日新闻”等认为条约意义深远
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本“读卖新闻”和“每日新闻”在评论中缅两国之间签订的友好和互不侵犯条约和中缅边界问题协定时，都强调指出条约和协定的重大意义。
    “读卖新闻”2月1日发表评论说，“在友好互不侵犯条约中值得注意的是，通篇贯彻着五项原则的精神。尤其值得注意的是以下两点：一、双方保证用和平协商的办法解决双方之间的一切争端，而不诉诸武力；二、缔约双方保证互不侵犯，不参加针对另一方的军事同盟。”
    这家报纸在谈到中缅边界问题协定时指出，复杂的边界问题仅仅经过周恩来、奈温举行五天会谈就达成了协议。
    “每日新闻”在1月30日发表评论说，中缅两国签订的条约和协定“好像有划时代的意义”。它说，这将使“自从发生中印边界纠纷以来，在很不平静的喜马拉雅山地区打开了新的局面”。
    “每日新闻”在2月1日刊载的特派记者高田发自香港的一篇通讯再次评论了中缅条约和协定。这篇通讯对中国的政策作了许多主观的推测，但是它承认条约和协定的深远意义。它说，这是中国第一次同外国签订互不侵犯条约，“是一个值得注意的外交措施”。
    这家报纸说，中国“以互不侵犯为基础的和平共处”这个计划也曾经向松村谦三提出过；而且，它还提出过建立一个包括美国、日本和苏联在内的太平洋集体保障安全体系作为它的亚洲外交方针。不过，人们认为，中国和奈温政府在确立和平五项原则以外，还以签订互不侵犯条约这种“条约”的形式向前迈出了一步这件事情，将会使东南亚各国对中国的看法产生相当大的影响。
