Beimengzhuang Management Area Innovates Production Processes

    (By Our Newspaper) The Party General Branch of the Beimengzhuang Management Area of Shuangmiao Commune in Jiaoge County, Hebei Province, through clever layout, clever arrangement, clever use of manpower, and clever work, vigorously promotes the innovation movement in the production process, resulting in a multiple increase in labor efficiency.
    The call issued by the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to launch the "Thousand Jin of Grain, Hundred Jin of Cotton, Ten Thousand Jin of Sweet Potatoes" bumper harvest campaign further inspired the cadres and members of the Beimengzhuang Management Area. They made ambitious plans to divide all the land into squares for management this year, adopt more advanced scientific management measures, and seize a continuous great leap forward this year. Achieving this goal requires 200,000 workdays. According to the calculations at the time, the entire management area could only provide 140,000 workdays, leaving 60,000 workdays unaccounted for. The Party General Branch Committee convened several meetings of commune members to mobilize everyone to contribute ideas and suggestions. The members of Wangzhuang Team recalled that in the agricultural cooperative, delivering manure to the north of the village was only separated by a wall, but it required a detour of two to three li. Later, a gap was opened in the wall, and the efficiency of manure delivery increased by three to four times. This fact greatly inspired the Party General Branch Committee, which decided to simultaneously grasp tool reform to form a complete set and launch a mass movement to innovate the production process, mobilizing members to innovate while producing. After mobilizing members to contribute ideas and suggestions, 25 innovation suggestions were put forward. Summarizing them, they included four aspects: clever layout, clever arrangement, clever use of manpower, and clever work. Clever layout involves cleverly arranging various basic construction projects according to the process of each work stage, making each process more closely connected and more reasonable, which can greatly save labor and transportation. Clever arrangement is to add some necessary equipment for more favorable cultivation. For example, tillage points are set up in distant bumper harvest squares, bridges are built, and roads are repaired to turn distant land into nearby land. Clever use of manpower is to assign different tasks according to the specialties of the members, establish reasonable labor organizations and various responsibility systems according to the characteristics of the bumper harvest squares, and engage in production scientifically according to the laws of crop development and seasonal characteristics, so that production can be carried out more rhythmically and fully utilize the specialties and production enthusiasm of the members. Clever work is to use tools more cleverly on the basis of a large number of tool reforms, with one person doing the work of several people. For example, one person drives two carts when delivering manure, and the well platform is raised and long ridges are changed to short ridges when watering. After adopting these suggestions, preliminary calculations indicate that 70,000 workdays can be saved throughout the year. The General Branch decided to vigorously promote these suggestions.
    In the movement, the Party General Branch conscientiously implemented the policy of running the commune diligently and thriftily, emphasizing making do with whatever is available and adapting to local conditions. The Party General Branch had studied each item in advance, formulated plans, and actively handled whatever was needed for current production and could be done with the available resources; for those that required large investments, a lot of labor, and could not be done now, the reasons were explained to the members, and they were postponed or gradually implemented. In this way, the innovation movement of the production process was closely integrated with the current production, which strongly promoted the current production.
    The production process innovation movement in the Beimengzhuang Management Area has greatly accelerated the progress of wheat field management and spring plowing production. For example, the 4,000 mu of wheat fields in the entire management area need to be top-dressed with returning green fertilizer and watered with returning green water. If the old method is adopted, it will take until March to complete. Through vigorously innovating the production process, measures such as raising the well platform, raising the water ridge ditch, changing long ridges to short ridges, and implementing group well convergence irrigation are adopted for watering. In terms of topdressing, joint operations of cleaning, delivering, and applying processes and one person driving multiple vehicles are adopted. At present, 60% of the wheat fields in the area have been top-dressed with returning green fertilizer, and 35% have been watered with returning green water. For another example, more than 400 mu of spring wheat are planted in the entire management area, requiring a total of 160 laborers and 80 animal power. By adopting the method of the drill bringing the roller and adding a rein to replace the person next to the drill, 40 man-days and 40 animal-days are saved. After the labor efficiency was greatly improved, each production team revised the production increase plan and increased management measures. (Attached picture)

    巧布局　巧设置　巧用兵　巧干活
    北孟庄管理区革新生产过程
    本报讯　河北省交河县双庙公社北孟庄管理区党总支通过巧布局、巧设置、巧用兵、巧干活，大搞生产过程革新运动，使劳动效率成倍提高。
    中共河北省委发出的开展“千斤粮、百斤棉、万斤薯”丰产运动的号召，进一步鼓舞了北孟庄管理区的干部和社员，他们立下雄心壮志，决心在今年把全部土地划方经营，采取更先进的科学管理措施，夺取今年的继续大跃进。实现这个目标，需要用二十万个劳动日。按当时算账，全管理区仅能出十四万个劳动日，其余六万个劳动日没有着落。党总支委员会连续召开了几次社员大会，发动人人献策献计。王庄队的社员们，回忆在农业社时，往村北送粪，只一墙之隔，就要绕路二、三里，后来在墙上开了一道豁口，送粪工效提高了三、四倍。这一事实，使党总支委员会受到很大启示，决定一手抓工具改革配套成龙，一手抓群众性的生产过程革新运动，发动社员边生产、边革新。经过发动社员献策献计，先后提出了二十五条革新建议。归纳起来，共包括四个方面：巧布局，巧设置，巧用兵，巧干活。巧布局，是将各项基本建设根据各个工序的过程，巧妙地布置，使各道工序衔接得更紧密，更合理，可以大量节约劳动力和运输力。巧设置，是为了更有利于耕作，增设一些必要的设备。如远地丰产方设置耕作点，架桥补路，使远地变近地。巧用兵，是根据社员的专长，分配不同的任务，根据丰产方的特点，建立合理的劳动组织和各种责任制度，并根据作物发展的规律和季节的特点，科学地从事生产，使生产更有节奏地进行，充分发挥社员的专长和生产积极性。巧干活，是在大量改革工具的基础上，更巧妙地使用工具，一人干几人的活。如送粪时一人赶两车，浇水时垫高井台，长畦改短畦等。采用这些建议之后，初步计算，全年即可节省七万个劳动日。总支决定大力推行这些建议。
    运动中，党总支认真贯彻了勤俭办社的方针，强调因陋就简，因地制宜。事先党总支曾逐条进行了研究，订出规划，凡是当前生产需要并且有力量办到的，就积极去办；凡投资大、用工多、现在无力量办的，就向社员说明道理，缓办或逐步去办。这样，就使生产过程的革新运动与当前生产密切结合起来，有力地推动了当前生产。
    北孟庄管理区开展生产过程革新运动，大大加快了麦田管理和春耕生产的进度。如全管理区的四千亩麦田，需要普追返青肥和普浇返青水，如果采用老办法，需要到3月份才能搞完。通过大搞生产过程革新，在浇水上采取了垫高井台、抬高水垅沟、改长畦为短畦和实行群井汇浇等办法，在追肥上采取清、送、施各工序联合作业和一人赶多车等办法，目前全区麦田有60％追了返青肥，35％的浇了返青水。又如全管理区种四百多亩春麦，共需一百六十个劳动力和八十个畜力，通过采取耧后带砘子和添条缰绳代傍耧人的办法，节省了四十个人工和四十个畜工。在劳动效率大大提高以后，各生产队重新修订了增产计划，并增加了管理措施。（附图片）
