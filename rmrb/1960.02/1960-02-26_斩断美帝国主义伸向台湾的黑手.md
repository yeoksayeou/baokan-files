    Chop off the black hand of American imperialism reaching towards Taiwan
    Jian Bozan
    After reading the Xinhua News Agency's report about American imperialism openly plundering our country's ancient and precious cultural relics in Taiwan, I felt boundless indignation. I fully endorse the statement issued by our Ministry of Culture warning the U.S. government to immediately cease its looting of our cultural relics: "All 'contracts' signed by the U.S. government with the Chiang Kai-shek clique to plunder our historical relics are invalid."

    It should be solemnly pointed out that the Chinese cultural relics that American imperialism is attempting to steal this time are not ordinary cultural relics, but the essence of all the cultural relics that the Chiang Kai-shek clique smuggled to Taiwan. They are the most exquisite part of all the historical relics collected in our country from past dynasties before the national liberation. These include stone tools, pottery, jade artifacts, bronzes, porcelain, oracle bones, Han bamboo slips, famous paintings, calligraphy, rare books from the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, and historical archives, etc. These cultural relics are of extremely significant value for the study of Chinese history, culture, science, and art. This value cannot be calculated in money, and they can all be said to be priceless treasures. Now, American imperialism shamelessly announces in the name of the U.S. State Department that it will use U.S. Navy warships to openly plunder these precious cultural relics—the historical and cultural heritage of the Chinese people—to the United States. This gangster behavior of American imperialism is nothing short of a resounding slap in the face to Mr. President Eisenhower, who has repeatedly declared that he does not want to get anything from countries around the world.

    Of course, for the American ruling clique, they may consider this a victory, because in the past they only engaged in petty theft in the Chinese cultural treasure house under the guise of scholarship, while now they simply use political means to openly plunder on a large scale. In the past, they still regarded looting other people's historical relics as an indecent thing, but now they dare to shamelessly issue a statement by the U.S. State Department and openly dispatch warships to carry out the plunder. It is said that a certain Mr. Horace Jayne, the vice director of the Philadelphia Museum in the United States, once said: Looting this batch of Chinese cultural relics is "an unavoidable international obligation" for the United States. May I ask what kind of "international obligation" this is? A country actually regards stealing other people's culture as its own international obligation, this simply means that they have no sense of shame in the world.

    Taiwan is China's Taiwan, and everything on the land of Taiwan, including the historical relics smuggled to Taiwan by the Chiang Kai-shek clique, is the property of the Chinese people. The Chinese people do not allow the Chiang Kai-shek clique to sell it in any name, and do not allow American imperialism to plunder it in any name. Warning American imperialism: Withdraw your black hands!

    斩断美帝国主义伸向台湾的黑手
    翦伯赞
    看了新华社报道的美帝国主义公开劫夺我国在台湾的古代珍贵文物的消息以后，我感到无比的愤慨。我完全拥护我国文化部发表的警告美国政府立即停止对我文物的盗劫行为的声明：“美国政府同蒋介石集团签订的一切劫夺我国历史文物的‘合同’均属无效。”
    应该郑重地指出这次美帝国主义企图盗劫的我国文物，不是普通的文物，而是被蒋介石集团偷运到台湾的全部文物的精华，是全国解放以前，我国历代以来收藏的全部历史文物中的最精美的一部分。其中包括石器、陶器、玉器、青铜器、瓷器、甲骨、汉简、名画、法书、宋元明善本书，以及历史档案等等。这些文物对于研究中国历史、文化科学和艺术都具有极其重大的价值，这种价值是不能用金钱计算的，可以说都是无价之宝。现在美帝国主义却毫无廉耻地用美国国务院的名义宣布，要用美国的海军军舰把这些珍贵的文物——中国人民的历史的文化遗产，公开地劫运到美国去。美国帝国主义的这种强盗行径，对于一再宣言不希望从世界各国得到什么东西的美国总统艾森豪威尔先生不啻一记响亮的耳光。
    当然对于美国统治集团来说，也许认为这是他们的一个胜利，因为他们在过去只是披着学术的外衣来在中国文化宝库中小偷小摸，而现在则索性用政治手段来公开的大肆劫掠。在过去还把劫掠别人的历史文物看作是不大体面的事情，而现在则敢于无耻地由美国国务院发表声明，公然派遣军舰，进行劫掠。据说有一位美国什么费城博物馆的副馆长霍雷斯·杰尼先生曾经说过：打劫这批中国文物对美国来说“是一种不可逃避的国际义务”，请问这是什么“国际义务”？一个国家竟把盗劫别人的文化当作自己的国际义务，这简直是不知人间尚有羞耻事。
    台湾是中国的台湾，在台湾土地上的一切包括被蒋介石集团偷运到台湾去的历史文物都是中国人民的财产，中国人民不许蒋介石集团以任何名义盗卖，不许美帝国主义以任何名义劫夺。警告美帝：缩回你的黑手吧！
