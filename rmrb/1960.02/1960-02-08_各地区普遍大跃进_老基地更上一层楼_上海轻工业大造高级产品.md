    All Regions Universally Leap Forward; Old Bases Climb to New Heights
    Shanghai Light Industry Massively Produces High-End Products
    (Our newspaper, Shanghai, 7th dispatch) Striving for perfection and developing towards high-end precision products is the policy determined by Shanghai's light industry based on the situation of the nationwide Great Leap Forward. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, many cities have newly built and expanded a large number of small and medium-sized daily necessities factories, and the quality of products in some places has successively approached, caught up with, and even surpassed the level of Shanghai goods. Faced with this excellent situation, the Shanghai light industry department regards the trial production and production of high-end products as an important aspect of achieving continuous leap forward. They have determined that in the future, in addition to greatly increasing the production of more and better ordinary daily necessities, they will also climb to a higher level and actively trial-produce and produce high-end precision products.
    This development direction of Shanghai's light industry department can not only correctly handle the division of labor and collaboration between coastal industries and inland industries, large city industries and small county and town industries, and can make reasonable arrangements in terms of raw material supply and product sales, but also can provide a broad way for large industrial cities to carry out technological transformation on the existing basis, so as to better play the role of the base.
    After two years of research, trial production and small-scale experimental production, the production of high-end precision products in Shanghai's light industry sector this year will have unprecedented development. Watches, cameras, film, detergents, acid-resistant enamel, optical glass and other new products with high technical requirements that were once considered "blank spots" in the history of China's light industry will all increase exponentially this year; high-end products in products such as fountain pens, paper, bicycles, sewing machines, and children's toys will also increase at a rate far exceeding the development speed of general products this year. In addition, all industries are also preparing to trial-produce a batch of newer and better high-end new products within the year.
    The rapid development of Shanghai's light industry towards high-end precision is due to the fact that Shanghai's light industry has a large foundation and good conditions, but more importantly, it has conscientiously implemented the policy of combining foreign and local methods, and combining large, medium and small enterprises, taking two roads. Almost all of these high-end product factories have developed from small to large, and from local to foreign. In the process of development, all departments closely combined with the economic reorganization of the original enterprises, so the cost was very small, and the effect was both fast and great. For example, the Shanghai Photosensitive Film Factory was originally a factory that produced carbon paper. The Shanghai Stationery and Educational Supplies Industry Company saw that this product of carbon paper can now be manufactured everywhere, so while ensuring the continuous growth of carbon paper and meeting market needs, it renovated the factory's buildings, added the necessary production equipment, and built Shanghai's first film factory, saving more than 600,000 yuan in investment compared to building a factory of the same scale. Shanghai's original seven match factories have been merged and reorganized, and now there is only one factory left, and the remaining six have become sewing machine factories, plastic product factories, and electric toy factories. Others, such as camera factories, optical glass factories, and acid-resistant enamel factories, have been rebuilt and developed from the original mimeograph machine factories, thermos bottle factories, and enamel washbasin factories. The Shanghai Watch Factory has expanded from small to large through three relocations and expansions, and has now become a factory that can produce hundreds of thousands of watches a year.

### 各地区普遍大跃进　老基地更上一层楼  上海轻工业大造高级产品

    各地区普遍大跃进　老基地更上一层楼
    上海轻工业大造高级产品
    本报上海7日电　精益求精向高级精密产品方向发展，是上海轻工业根据全国大跃进的形势而确定的方针。从1958年大跃进以来，许多城市新建和扩建了大批中小型的日用品工厂，有些地方的产品质量也先后接近、赶上甚至超过了上海货的水平。面对这个大好形势，上海轻工业部门就把试制和生产高级产品作为实现持续跃进的一个重要方面。他们确定今后除大量增产更多更好的普通日用品外，还要更上一层楼，积极试制并生产高级精密产品。
    上海轻工业部门这个发展方向，不仅可以正确处理沿海工业和内地工业、大城市工业和小县镇工业之间的分工协作问题，可以在原料供应、产品销售等方面得到合理安排，而且可以为大工业城市在旧有基础上进行技术改造，以便更好地发挥基地作用开辟广阔的途径。
    经过过去两年研究试制和小量试验生产。今年上海轻工部门高级精密产品的生产，将有空前的发展。手表、照相机、胶卷、洗涤剂、耐酸搪瓷、光学玻璃等原来在我国轻工业史上一直被认为是“空白点”的、技术要求较高的新产品，今年都将成倍地增长；金笔、纸张、自行车、缝纫机、儿童玩具等产品中的高档货，今年增长的幅度也将大大超过一般产品的发展速度。另外，各行业还准备在年内再试制一批更新更好的高级新产品。
    上海轻工业向高级精密方向飞速发展，除了上海轻工业基础大、条件好这些原因外，更重要的原因是认真贯彻了洋土并举、大中小企业并举两条腿走路的方针。所有这些高级产品的工厂，几乎全部都是从小到大、从土到洋地发展起来的。在发展过程中，各部门密切地结合着原有企业的经济改组工作，所以花钱很少，见效既快又大。例如上海感光软片厂，原来是一个生产复写纸的工厂。上海文教用品工业公司看到复写纸这种产品现在各地都能制造，就在保证复写纸不断增长和满足市场需要的情况下，把这个工厂的厂房加以改建，添置了必要的生产设备，建成了上海第一个胶卷厂，投资比新建一个同样规模的工厂节省了六十多万元。上海原有的七个火柴厂，经过合并改组，现在只有一个工厂了，其余六个都变成了缝纫机厂、塑料制品厂、电动玩具厂。其他如照相机厂、光学玻璃厂、耐酸搪瓷厂等，都是由原来的油印机厂、热水瓶厂、搪瓷面盆厂改建而发展起来的。上海手表厂因陋就简，从小到大地经过三次迁厂扩建，现在已经成为一个可以年产几十万只手表的工厂了。
