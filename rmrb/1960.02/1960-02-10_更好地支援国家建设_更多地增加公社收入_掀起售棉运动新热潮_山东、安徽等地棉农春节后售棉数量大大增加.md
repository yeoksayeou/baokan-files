Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 9th: After joyfully celebrating the Spring Festival, commune members in cotton-producing areas of Shandong Province are even more enthusiastic about selling their stored cotton. The province's cotton procurement volume has been rising daily recently. For example, the cotton procured on February 3rd more than doubled compared to the 1st and 2nd, and increased by 18% compared to the average daily procurement volume in late January.

Party committees at all levels in Liaocheng, Changwei, Zibo and other areas, in accordance with the characteristics of the later stages of cotton procurement work, generally strengthened their leadership of this work, with the secretaries taking the lead. During the Spring Festival, sixteen people's communes in Guanxian County transferred more than 1,400 cadres, led by the Party Secretary, to go to various production teams to organize Spring Festival get-togethers for commune members, implement policies, mobilize the masses, and create a new upsurge in cotton sales. The county procured more than 89,000 jin of seed cotton in the four days from January 28th to 31st, a significant increase compared to the daily procurement volume before the Spring Festival. The daily procurement volume of seed cotton in Heze City after the Spring Festival reached more than 28,000 jin, an increase of more than four times compared to the daily procurement of 5,000 jin before the Spring Festival. Linqing City, which has already completed its annual cotton procurement plan, due to abundant cotton resources, the commune members enthusiastically responded to the call of the municipal party committee, and recently launched a wave of selling ten thousand jin of cotton per team.

In order to sell more cotton to the state, various localities vigorously carried out the work of stripping and picking cotton stalks and re-harvesting cotton. Gaomi County recently mobilized 50,000 people to strip the cotton from the cotton stalks. Linqing City adopted the "six determinations" (determine people, determine stacks, determine quantity, determine quality, determine time, determine remuneration) in cotton stripping, so that the cotton remaining on the cotton stalks was picked and cleaned.

Commercial departments have adopted a combination of fixed procurement and mobile procurement methods to facilitate the masses' sales everywhere. Gaotang County originally had 65 procurement points, and recently added 65 temporary procurement points and 137 mobile procurement teams, to procure cotton from village to village and door to door. The cotton procurement points and procurement teams in Linqing City are all over the city, and they receive cotton day and night, which is very popular among the masses.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 9th: Many people's communes in Anhui Province continue to enthusiastically sell cotton to the state after the Spring Festival. Since February, the daily cotton procurement volume in the province has increased compared to the previous period. For example, the cotton procured in Anqing Prefecture in the first week of February increased by more than four times compared to late January.

Many people's communes have recently specifically organized labor to rush to sell stored cotton and carry out cotton re-harvesting work, and sell the cotton that has not been picked clean from the cotton stalks and cotton fields to the state. The key cotton-producing areas of Anqing Prefecture recently arranged 15,000 people to be responsible for cotton stripping, picking, and selling. The Guangwu People's Commune in Jieshou County organized commune members to send cotton for sale, and sold more than 100 dan of seed cotton to the state on February 5th and 6th.

Recently, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed all localities to continue to launch a cotton procurement campaign. Now, all localities are conscientiously implementing this instruction, with the secretaries of party committees at all levels personally taking the lead, and sending many cadres to help all localities carry out procurement work. The Provincial Department of Commerce has also sent five working groups to various places to help with the work.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 9th: Jinan Prefecture in Shanxi Province, which completed 90% of its annual cotton procurement plan by the end of last year, recently launched a cotton procurement clean-up campaign in order to bring the cotton procurement work to a good end. This campaign requires that the fields be picked clean, the threshing floors be cleaned, the cotton stalks be picked clean, the cottonseeds be stripped clean, and the cotton picked up by the commune members and the surplus cotton stored at home be sold clean, so as to complete the cotton procurement task ahead of schedule.

Now, the cotton procurement campaign is in full swing throughout the prefecture. Wanrong, Wenxi, Ruicheng, Pinglu and other eight counties have overfulfilled this year's procurement tasks; Linyi, Yicheng, Fushan and other eight counties are also close to completion.

At the beginning of this campaign, from the prefecture to the counties, communes, and management districts, the first secretaries of the party committees took the lead to strengthen leadership, and paid special attention to strengthening leadership in weak links. The cotton procurement tasks of Hongdong, Linfen and other four counties were poorly completed. The four secretaries of the Jinan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China led working teams to these four counties to help with the work, prompting these four counties to quickly change the backward situation in procurement work.

At the beginning of the campaign, mass rallies were held in the management districts and production teams of each commune to repeatedly publicize the benefits of completing the cotton procurement task ahead of schedule for supporting national construction and increasing commune income. During the campaign, from the prefecture to the management district, a daily evaluation, every-other-day evaluation, or five-day evaluation system for cotton procurement work was established; the management districts widely established honor rolls, and regularly commended model figures in the campaign at mass rallies. Many old thrift households competed to sell their surplus cotton accumulated over the past ten years to the state.

All relevant business departments in the prefecture conscientiously implemented the procurement policy of high quality and good prices, increased the number of procurement points from 215 in the past to 885, and set up procurement personnel in each natural village to facilitate the masses' sales. In coordination with cotton procurement, commercial departments strengthened the supply of materials.

    更好地支援国家建设　更多地增加公社收入
    掀起售棉运动新热潮
    山东、安徽等地棉农春节后售棉数量大大增加
    据新华社济南9日电　山东省产棉地区人民公社的社员们，在欢度春节后，出售存棉更加踊跃。全省棉花收购量近来逐日上升，如2月3日收购的棉花比1、2日上升一倍以上，比1月下旬平均日收购量上升18％。
    聊城、昌潍、淄博等地区各级党委根据后期棉花收购工作的特点，普遍由书记挂帅，加强了对这一工作的领导。冠县十六个人民公社在春节期间共抽调一千四百多名干部，由党委书记带领，分头到各生产队，一面组织社员举行春节联欢，一面贯彻政策，发动群众，掀起售棉新高潮。全县1月28日至31日四天内收购了籽棉八万九千多斤，比春节前的日收购量大大增加。菏泽市春节后的籽棉日收购量达到二万八千多斤，比春节前的日收购五千斤增加四倍以上。已经完成全年棉花收购计划的临清市，由于棉源丰富，各人民公社社员们热烈响应市委的号召，最近又掀起了队队出售万斤棉的热潮。
    各地为了多卖棉花给国家，大力开展了棉柴剥摘和复收工作。高密县最近发动了五万人剥摘棉柴上的棉花。临清市在剥棉中采取“六定”（定人、定垛、定量、定质、定时间、定报酬）的办法，将棉柴上存留的棉花剥拾干净。
    商业部门采取固定收购和流动收购相结合的办法，处处便利群众出售。高唐县原有六十五个收购点，最近又增设六十五个临时收购点、一百三十七个流动收购组，逐村串户地收购。临清市的棉花收购点和收购组遍及全市，日夜都收，很受群众欢迎。
    据新华社合肥9日电　安徽省各地许多人民公社春节后继续踊跃出售棉花给国家。2月份以来，全省每天的棉花收购量比前一个时期有所增加。如安庆专区2月第一周收购的棉花比1月下旬增加了四倍多。
    许多人民公社最近专门组织劳动力，突击出售储存的棉花，并且进行棉花的复收工作，把棉秸上、棉田里没有摘净拾净的棉花收下来卖给国家。安庆专区的重点产棉区，最近安排了一万五千人，担任棉花的剥摘和出售等工作。界首县光武人民公社组织社员送售棉花，2月5、6两日共卖给国家一百多担籽棉。
    最近，中共安徽省委指示各地继续开展一个收购棉花的运动。现在，各地都认真贯彻这一指示，各级党委书记亲自挂帅，并且派出许多干部帮助各地开展收购工作。省商业厅也派出了五个工作组去各地帮助工作。
    据新华社太原9日电　到去年底完成了全年棉花收购计划90％的山西省晋南专区，为了使棉花收购工作善始善终，最近开展了一个棉花收购扫尾运动。这次运动要求作到地里拾净，场里拣净，棉秆上采净，棉籽上剥净，社员拾回来的棉花和家里的多余存棉卖净，提前完成棉花收购任务。
    现在，棉花收购运动正在全专区热火朝天地展开。万荣、闻喜、芮城、平陆等八个县已经超额完成了今年度的收购任务；临猗、翼城、浮山等八个县也接近完成。
    这个运动一开始，从专区到各县、各公社、管理区，都由党委第一书记挂帅加强领导，并且特别注意加强对薄弱环节的领导。洪洞、临汾等四个县的棉花收购任务完成得较差，中共晋南地委的四个书记就率领工作队分别到这四个县去帮助工作，促使这四个县迅速改变了收购工作落后的面貌。
    各公社的管理区和生产队，在运动开始时都举行了群众大会，反复宣传了提前完成棉花收购任务对支援国家建设、增加公社收入的好处。在运动中，从专区到管理区，都建立了日日评、隔日评或五日评的棉花收购工作评比制度；各管理区广泛建立了光荣榜，经常在群众大会上表扬运动中的模范人物。很多老节约户争着把自己过去十年来积下来的多余存棉卖给国家。
    全专区各有关业务部门认真贯彻了优质优价的收购政策，将收购点由过去的二百一十五个增加到八百八十五个，在每个自然村设置了收购员，便利群众出售。商业部门配合棉花收购，加强了物资供应工作。
