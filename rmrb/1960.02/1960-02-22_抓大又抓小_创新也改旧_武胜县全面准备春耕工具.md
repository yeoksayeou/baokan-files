Grasp the Big and the Small, Innovate and Renovate
Wusheng County Fully Prepares Spring Farming Tools

    (Our dispatch) Wusheng County, Sichuan Province, according to the requirements of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for early planting, multiple planting, and high yields, focuses on "three big, ten small, and four dragons" to prepare good tools suitable for various conditions such as dry land, paddy fields, sunny days, and rainy days for each laborer and each draught animal, in order to welcome the spring's great production.
    The "three big" are three large farm tools: plows, harrows, and waterwheels; the "ten small" are ten small farm tools or essential items for work: hoes, hoe handles, sickles, manure buckets, manure dippers, baskets, back baskets, carrying poles, rain capes, and bamboo hats; the "four dragons" refer to the realization of continuous semi-mechanization and tool improvement in the four major production processes of deep plowing and land preparation, water lifting and irrigation, transplanting and sowing, and harvesting and threshing. Due to the clear focus and early and effective implementation, Wusheng County has now produced more than three million various large and small spring farming tools, greatly exceeding the original plan; and manufactured more than 137,000 improved tools and semi-mechanized tools related to the "four dragons," providing enough spring plowing and sowing tools for the county's 220,000-strong labor force.
    The large-scale focus on "three big, ten small, and four dragons" is proposed by Wusheng County in response to the new situation in agricultural production this year. The industrial and commercial departments of the county found through investigation that, with the further implementation of the policy of early planting, multiple planting, and high yields, the types of crops have increased, the area has expanded, and the technical specifications are stricter, which requires greatly improving work efficiency. This not only requires repairing and adding old tools, but also requires new tools that significantly improve work efficiency. In addition, new crops need to have a batch of tools added. Therefore, the demand for various agricultural tools this year has increased by about 100% compared with last year, and the demand for new agricultural tools is even greater. After studying the above situation, the relevant departments of the county ranked various tools in rural areas according to their surplus, shortage, and increased demand, and decided to focus on "three big and ten small" for the preparation of old farm tools; to focus on the semi-mechanization and tool improvement of the four production processes that consume the most labor and have the greatest labor intensity, such as deep plowing and land preparation, water lifting and irrigation, transplanting and sowing, and harvesting and threshing; and to summarize and identify the existing new tools in these four aspects in the past, and select 21 types for vigorous manufacturing and promotion. In terms of the "three big and ten small," the county also put forward specific requirements of "three sets for cattle and ten uses for people." This means that each draught animal in the county should be equipped with three sets of tools: paddy field plows, dry land plows, and harrows; each laborer should be equipped with at least ten types of tools for hoeing, harvesting, carrying manure, and carrying fertilizer. Ensure that cattle power and human power are not wasted due to lack of tools.
    By focusing on the "three big, ten small, and four dragons," Wusheng County has not only paid attention to the supply of old tools with the largest quantity and indispensable, but also grasped the promotion of new tools with higher work efficiency in the preparation of spring farming tools; not only paid attention to the preparation of major large farm tools, but also did not ignore the manufacture of small tools; and not only paid attention to the tool reform of individual farm work, but also vigorously carried out complete innovation of tools for major production processes. In this way, Wusheng County can prepare spring farming tools early, properly, and completely.
    The spring farming tools needed by Wusheng County this year are large in quantity, various in variety, and relatively complex in specifications. Therefore, in solving the problem of manufacturing power, they adopted the method of hierarchical arrangement and hierarchical manufacturing. According to the different production conditions and technical levels of the four county-level machinery factories, thirty-four commune farm tool factories, and more than 400 management area-level farm tool repair stations, different agricultural tool production tasks were arranged hierarchically. For example, water pumps, rice transplanters, and other more complex new tools are manufactured by county-level machinery factories; improved tools such as improved waterwheels, soil crushing harrows, and northern sickles are manufactured by commune farm tool factories; and the tasks of reforming and manufacturing other tools such as simple deep plows, large curved sickles, and blade harrows are undertaken by the repair stations in the management areas. The ten small farm tools, which are huge in quantity, adopt the method of small-scale production during busy farming seasons and large-scale production during slack farming seasons. On the one hand, more than 300 specialized teams with more than 4,000 people are established to carry out year-round production; on the other hand, members are organized to rush production using their spare time. Through this series of measures, each type of farm tool factory has its own manufacturing focus, and the professional factory manufacturing is closely combined with mass shock attacks.

### 抓大又抓小　创新也改旧  武胜县全面准备春耕工具

    抓大又抓小　创新也改旧
    武胜县全面准备春耕工具
    本报讯　四川武胜县根据中共四川省委提出的早种、多种、高产的要求，以“三大、十小、四条龙”为中心，及早为每个劳动力和每条耕牛准备好适用于旱地、水田、天晴、下雨等各种条件的好工具，以迎接春季大生产。
    “三大”，是犁、耙、水车三种大农具；“十小”，是锄头、锄把、镰刀、粪桶、粪瓢、箩筐、背兜、扁担、蓑衣、斗笠十种小农具或出工的必备用品；“四条龙”是将深耕整地、提水灌溉、栽插播种、收割脱粒等四项主要生产过程实现一条龙式半机械化和工具改良化。由于中心明确，抓得早，抓得好，现在武胜县已生产各种大小春耕工具三百多万件，大大超过原订计划；并制造了有关“四条龙”的改良工具和半机械化工具二十一种，共十三万七千多件；为全县二十二万名劳动大军准备了足够的春耕春播工具。
    大抓“三大、十小、四条龙”，是武胜县针对今年农业生产新情况提出的。这个县的工业和商业部门调查发现，由于早种、多种、高产的方针进一步贯彻，作物种类增多，面积扩大，技术规格要求严格，这就必需大大提高工效，不仅要求修补、添制旧工具，而且要有显著提高工效的新式工具，新发展的作物还要添制一批工具。因此，今年各种农具需要量比去年增加一倍左右，新式农具的需要量更大。在研究上述情况后，这个县的有关部门按照农村中各种工具的余缺和需要增长情况，进行排队，决定以“三大、十小”为旧农具准备工作的重点；以深耕整地、提水灌溉、栽插播种、收割脱粒等占用劳力最多、劳动强度最大的四项生产过程的半机械化和工具改良化，作为改革工具的重点；把过去这四方面已有的新式工具加以总结鉴定，挑选出二十一种，大力制造推广。在“三大、十小”方面，这个县还提出了“牛有三套、人有十用”的具体要求。这就是要为全县每个耕牛备足水田犁、旱地犁、耙等三套工具；为每个劳力最少备足锄地、收割、担粪、背肥等十种用途的工具。保证牛力、人力不致因工具缺乏而发生窝工浪费的现象。
    由于抓住“三大、十小、四条龙”为重点，武胜县在春耕工具的准备中，既注意了数量最大、不可缺少的旧工具的供应，又抓住了工效更高的新式工具的推广；既注意了主要大农具的准备，又不忽略小工具的制造；既注意了单项农活的工具改革，又大力对主要生产过程的工具进行成套革新。这样，就使武胜县的春耕工具能及早地准备妥善、齐全。
    武胜县今年所需要的春耕工具，数量很大，品种繁多，规格也较复杂。因此，在解决制造力量的问题上，他们采取了分级安排、分级制造的办法。根据县级四个机械厂、三十四个公社农具厂以及四百多个管理区一级的农具修配站的不同生产条件和技术水平，分级安排了不同的农具生产任务。如抽水机、插秧机和其他较复杂的新式工具，由县级机械厂制造；改良水车、碎土耙、北方镰等改良工具由公社农具厂负责制造；其他如简易深耕犁、大弯镰、刀儿耙等工具的改制和制造任务，则由管理区的修配站担负。数量巨大的十种小农具，采取了农忙小搞、农闲大搞的办法，一方面成立了有四千多人的三百多个专业队，进行常年生产；一方面组织社员利用工余时间赶制。通过这一系列办法，使各类农具厂各有制造重点，又把专业工厂制造与群众性突击紧密结合起来。（附图片）
