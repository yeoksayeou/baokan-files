Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, February 7th: The Harbin Electric Machinery Plant, Qiqihar No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, Jiamusi Electric Machinery Plant, Mudanjiang Hardware and Electrical Factory, and more than twenty other factories, under the organization of the Harbin Supply Office of the First Ministry of Machine Building, promoted the spirit of communist cooperation and mutually solved the urgent needs for materials, strongly supporting the production of each factory.

According to statistics, since December of last year, the factories have mutually supported each other with more than 1,100 tons of steel, 58 tons of copper, aluminum, and non-ferrous metals, 71.8 tons of manganese silicon ferroalloy, 104 tons of pig iron, 2,972 sets of bearings, as well as a large number of welding rods, chemical materials, and other non-metallic materials.

The continuous leap forward in industrial production has led to frequent changes in the need for various materials. In order to solve this contradiction, the Harbin Supply Office of the First Ministry of Machine Building has organized more than twenty key factories directly under Heilongjiang Province into a unified material scheduling and cooperation network to adjust the urgently needed and short-supply materials in the production of each factory. For example, at a small cooperation meeting convened by the Supply Office in January, attended by nine key factories including the Harbin Electric Machinery Plant, Bearing Plant, and Boiler Plant, the Songjiang Electric Machinery Plant raised that its electric motor production was about to be affected due to a shortage of steel plates. The Bearing Plant then took out two tons of steel plates that were temporarily not in use to support the electric motor plant's production. The carbon steel urgently needed by the Bearing Plant for its production automation line was also resolved at the meeting with the help of factories such as the Steam Turbine Plant and Boiler Plant. The Harbin Electric Machinery Plant lacked various specifications of steel plates for manufacturing 72,500 kilowatt hydro-generators. After this was raised at the cooperation meeting, it immediately received support from six factories including the Harbin Steam Turbine Plant, Boiler Plant, and Songjiang Electric Machinery Plant, resolving 30 tons of steel plates and more than 90 tons of fluorite, limestone, and other materials used for producing electric motor castings.

    互济有无携手跃进
    黑龙江一批机械厂有计划地调剂材料
    新华社哈尔滨7日电　哈尔滨电机厂、齐齐哈尔第一机床厂、佳木斯电机厂、牡丹江五金电工厂等二十多个工厂，在第一机械工业部哈尔滨供应办事处的组织下，发扬共产主义协作精神，相互解决急需的材料，有力地支援了各厂的生产。
    据统计，从去年12月以来，各厂之间已经互相支援了钢材一千一百多吨，铜铝有色金属五十八吨，锰矽铁合金七十一点八吨，生铁一百零四吨，轴承二千九百七十二套，以及大批电焊条、化工材料和其他非金属材料等。
    工业生产的不断跃进，对各种材料需要经常发生变化。为了解决这个矛盾，第一机械工业部哈尔滨供应办事处把直属黑龙江省地区的二十多个重点工厂组成一个统一的材料调度协作网，调剂各工厂生产中急需的短缺材料。例如，供应办事处在1月份召集哈尔滨电机厂、轴承厂、锅炉厂等九个重点工厂举行的小型协作会议上，松江电机厂提出因缺少钢板，厂里电机生产即将受到影响，轴承厂就把暂时不用的钢板拿出两吨，支援电机厂生产。轴承厂搞生产自动线急需的碳素钢，也在会上得到汽轮机厂、锅炉厂等工厂的帮助而解决了。哈尔滨电机厂制造七万二千五百瓩水轮发电机缺少多种规格的钢板，在协作会上提出后，立即得到了哈尔滨汽轮机厂、锅炉厂、松江电机厂等六个工厂的支援，解决了三十吨钢板和生产电机铸件用的九十多吨萤石、石灰石等材料。
