    The Rebirth of the "Moți" People
    By Our Correspondent Wei Lingbing
    We drove south from Cluj, a famous city in western Romania, and after reaching Turda, an industrial hub, we turned west again. Following the Arieș River, known for its salmon, we entered the "Land of the Moți" in the Western Carpathian Mountains – the Câmpeni region.
    The homeland of the "Moți" people is a picturesque region. There are countless peaks here and valleys that seem endless. There are perennial ice columns and thousand-year-old ice caves. Even in winter, the colors of the mountains and pastures are beautifully painted. The pointed wooden houses of the "Moți" people are scattered on high hills or narrow valley plains.
    In the past, men here liked to braid their hair into two small braids hanging in front of their ears. These braids are called "moți" in Romanian. Therefore, the residents here were called the "Moți" people, and this area was called the "Land of the Moți". In fact, they do not form a separate ethnic group, but also belong to the hardworking and brave Romanian people.
    The Storms of the Carpathians
    In the centuries before Romania's unification, the "Moți" people, like other people in the Transylvania region, suffered the brutal rule of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires and were subjected to all kinds of exploitation by feudal nobles and merchants. At the end of the seventeenth century, Austria replaced Turkey's rule over the Transylvania region. The rich gold mines in the "Moți" region became the private property of the royal nobles, and the "Moți" people became "slaves of gold," having to perform more than two hundred days of labor each year for the court and nobles. From then on, the wooden shackles on the "Moți" people were replaced by heavy iron shackles.
    How could the upright and courageous "Moți" people endure this endless destruction and humiliation! In order to fight for freedom and land, they launched many armed uprisings. Câmpeni became the cradle of surging peasant revolutions. The uprising storms of 1784 and 1848 swept through the entire Transylvania region surrounded by the Carpathian Mountains. The leaders of these two large-scale uprisings were both "Moți" heroes, one named Horea, and the other Avram Iancu.
    Many peasant uprisings launched by the "Moți" people were brutally suppressed by domestic and foreign rulers. However, the flame of the "Moți" people's pursuit of freedom and happiness did not go out. This treasure land rich in gold was always in turmoil.
    The oppressed "Moți" people will never forgive any invaders. In 1944, a German fascist army invaded their region. The strong "Moți" people took up arms again, formed a local militia, and after two weeks of tenacious fighting, repelled the attack of the German devils.
    The Beginning of a New Era
    Before liberation, the Câmpeni region, where the "Moți" people lived, was the poorest and most backward region in Romania. At that time, there was no industry at all, farmers plowed the land with wooden plows, illiteracy was 75%, and lung disease and syphilis were rampant.
    There are rich gold mines underground here and forests that blot out the sky above. However, none of this belonged to the working people. Greedy domestic and foreign capitalists plundered these natural resources wantonly.
    In the "Moți" region, whether they were farmers, herdsmen, craftsmen, miners, or loggers, they all shared a common destiny—suffering and poverty. A folk song is a portrayal of their miserable lives:
    We have green pine forests, golden fields,
    Butterflies swarm here, flowers cover the mountains.
    Nightingales from afar come to listen to us sing "Doina," (Note)
    Our bitter tears flow into an ocean!
    After liberation, the dreams of the "Moți" people became a reality. The Party and the government did their best to help the "Moți" people quickly change their impoverished and backward state.
    Now, nearly 50% of the farmers and herdsmen here have embarked on the road of cooperation. There are forty-three collective farms in the county, including four thousand five hundred households. We visited the collective farm named after the uprising hero Horea. Collective labor has enabled this collective farm to achieve unprecedented harvests. The yield per unit area of naked barley and potatoes has more than doubled compared with before liberation, and livestock products have also increased significantly. The lives of the members are incomparable to what they were before liberation. Before liberation, member Mădaiș Iosif wore linen clothes and wooden shoes, often had no food to eat, and his family of twelve lived in a wooden house. Now he earns more than two thousand five hundred lei (Romanian currency) from the collective farm every month, his small family of three lives in three new houses, and he and his wife have more than twenty pieces of clothing.
    Many woodworking craftsmen have also organized themselves. The "Horea-Moți" Woodworking Production Cooperative has built two new large workshops and has begun to use machines to replace manual operations. This cooperative has two tractors for transporting wood. Their products can be transported directly to the state purchasing station by their own two trucks. The average monthly income of the members is eight hundred lei. However, before liberation, these craftsmen had to travel everywhere to sell their products. Many people were so poor that they could not afford to eat or return home and were forced to wander around.
    The working conditions and living conditions of miners have undergone tremendous changes. Before liberation, miners' safety was not guaranteed, and countless people lost their lives in the mines. At that time, miners were like cattle and horses, transporting ore in narrow, muddy tunnels. They mined gold for the mine owners, but the price they paid was disease and hunger. Now, the mining, transportation, and processing of ore have basically been mechanized. Serious deaths and injuries have been eliminated. The average wage of miners has more than doubled compared with before the nationalization of the gold mines. They can also enjoy many welfare benefits and pension benefits.
    Because the harvesting and transportation of wood has been partially mechanized, the heavy labor of loggers has also been greatly reduced. Their average monthly wage has reached one thousand lei. Before liberation, many loggers had no houses to live in. Since liberation, 80% of the loggers have built new houses.
    The "Moți" people are no longer satisfied with those simple wooden houses. Recently, most of them have built solid and beautiful sets of houses with brick and cement. Nearly half of the houses in this area have been newly built since liberation. On rest days, you can see that the quality of the clothes worn by the "Moți" people is no less than that worn by city people, only the styles of the clothes are somewhat distinctive.
    In the Câmpeni region before liberation, there was no industry except for handicrafts that could only make wooden barrels. Now there are three timber factories, and quarries, bakeries, fruit processing factories, and other factories have also been established. Before liberation, commerce here was also extremely underdeveloped. People often could not sell what they wanted to sell or buy what they wanted to buy. Now there are more than one hundred and fifty state-owned stores, consumer cooperatives, and cooperative stores in the county, forming a thriving commercial network.
    Before liberation, electric lights were still a novelty to the "Moți" people, but now more than half of the towns in the county have been installed with electric lights. Transportation here is also much more convenient than before liberation. Now buses reach every town, and there is also a small railway to here.
    The Rich Fruits of Culture and Health
    After liberation, the cultural and health outlook of the "Moți" people has been completely renewed.
    Before liberation, the illiteracy rate in Câmpeni county was 75%, there was no middle school, and there were only twenty-six primary schools. Now the number of middle and primary schools has increased to one hundred and eighteen, and illiteracy was completely eliminated in 1956. Before liberation, no children of workers and peasants could go to university. Now, more than fifty middle school students are admitted to institutions of higher learning every year. Before liberation, there was only one cinema and two cultural centers in the county. Now the number of cinemas has increased ninefold, the number of cultural centers has increased sixteenfold, and libraries have been established in seventy-six villages. The enthusiasm of the working people for learning culture is getting higher and higher. Many people also love Chinese literature very much. We saw in a library that the translated version of "Heroes of Lüliang" by Ma Feng and Xi Rong had been turned very old. The librarian said that this is a very popular novel among readers.
    With the improvement of cultural standards, the artistic life of the "Moți" people has also become active. At present, there are eighty-three song and dance teams, drama teams, art propaganda teams, and folk instrument ensembles in the county. These organizations did not exist at all before liberation. Last year, they selected the best actors to participate in the Fifth National Literary and Art Performance. Their performance of the long shepherd's flute won the second prize. The second drama competition is currently underway in the county.
    The "Girls' Fair" is a traditional festival of the "Moți" people. Every year on July 17th, many "Moți" girls dress up beautifully and go to the top of Găina Mountain. Of course, batches of young men arrive at the same time as them. Among them, many people fall in love at first sight here and become lifelong partners.
    In recent years, the activities of the "Girls' Fair" have become richer and more colorful. It not only provides young men and women who live far apart with opportunities to meet and fall in love, but it has also become a day for the entire county to hold literary and artistic performances and material exchanges. Last year's "Girls' Fair" was unprecedented, with more than five thousand people coming from all over to participate.
    Before liberation, more than 70% of the residents of Câmpeni County suffered from lung disease or syphilis, and the infant mortality rate was as high as 17%. At that time, there was only one hospital and three health stations in the county. Now there are three hospitals with more than five hundred beds and fifteen health stations, and eleven maternity hospitals that did not exist before liberation have also been established. At present, there are two hundred and eighty-nine medical personnel in the county, more than ten times more than before liberation. Due to the great increase in medical institutions and medical personnel, the health of the "Moți" people has quickly improved. Lung disease and syphilis have now been basically eliminated, and the infant mortality rate is decreasing year by year. This county used to have the highest infant mortality rate in the entire state, but now it has become the county with the lowest infant mortality rate. All the thousands of babies born in the county last year survived.
    (Note) "Doina" is a kind of sad folk song.

    “摩茨”人的新生
    本报记者　魏凌冰
    我们从罗马尼亚的西部名城克鲁日驱车南下，到达工业重镇图尔达后又转向西行，沿着盛产鲑鱼的阿里耶什河，进入了西喀尔巴阡山中的“摩茨人之国”——克姆别尼县。
    “摩茨”人的家乡是风光绮丽的地区。这里有数不尽的山峰，走不遍的河谷。这里有终年不化的冰柱和千年的冰窟。即使是在冬天，山林和牧场的颜色也美丽如画。“摩茨”人的尖顶木房散落在高高的山岗或狭窄的河谷平原上。
    过去，这里的男子爱把头发扎成两个小辫垂在耳前。这种小辫在罗马尼亚语文中叫做“摩茨”。于是，这里的居民就被称为“摩茨”人，这个地区也被称为“摩茨人之国”了。其实，他们并不自成一个民族，也是属于勤劳勇敢的罗马尼亚族。
    喀尔巴阡山的风暴
    在罗马尼亚统一以前的几个世纪中，“摩茨”人也像德兰斯瓦尼亚地区的其他人民一样，曾经先后遭到奥斯曼帝国和奥匈帝国的残暴统治，受到封建贵族和商人的百般剥削。在十七世纪末期，奥地利取代了土耳其对德兰斯瓦尼亚地区的统治。“摩茨”人地区的丰富的金矿成了皇宫贵族的私产，而“摩茨”人也成了“金子的奴隶”，每年要为宫廷和贵族做两百天以上的劳役。从这以后，“摩茨”人身上的木枷换成了沉重的铁枷。
    正直勇敢的“摩茨”人哪能忍受这种无尽的摧残和屈辱！他们为了争取自由和土地，曾经发动了多次武装起义。克姆别尼成了风起云涌的农民革命的摇篮。1784年和1848年的起义风暴席卷了喀尔巴阡山环抱的整个德兰斯瓦尼亚地区。这两次大规模起义的领导者都是“摩茨”人的英雄，一个叫霍里亚，一个叫阿弗拉姆·杨古。
    “摩茨”人掀起的许多次农民起义都被国内外统治者残酷地镇压下去了。但是，“摩茨”人争取自由幸福的火焰并没有熄灭。这个盛产黄金的宝地始终处在风雨飘摇中。
    饱受压迫的“摩茨”人永远不会饶恕任何侵略者。在1944年，有一股德国法西斯军队向他们地区进犯。强悍的“摩茨”人重新拿起了武器，组成了一个子弟营，经过两个星期的顽强战斗，打退了德国鬼子的进攻。
    新时代的开始
    在解放前，“摩茨”人居住的克姆别尼县是罗马尼亚全国最贫穷落后的地区。那时，工业完全没有，农民用木犁耕地，文盲占75％，肺病和梅毒到处流行。
    这里地下有丰富的金矿，地上有遮天的森林。但是，这一切都不属于劳动者。贪婪的国内外资本家对这些自然财富肆意掠夺。
    在“摩茨”人地区，不论是农牧民、手工业者、矿工或伐木者，他们都有一个共同的命运——痛苦和贫穷。有一首歌谣就是他们的悲惨生活的写照：
    我们有绿色的松林，金色的原野，
    我们这里蝴蝶成群，鲜花遍山岗。
    远方的夜莺飞来倾听我们歌唱“道
      伊那”，（注）
    我们的辛酸的眼泪流成海洋！
    在解放后，“摩茨”人的梦想成了现实。党和政府尽最大努力帮助“摩茨”人迅速改变了贫穷和落后的面貌。
    现在，这里有将近50％的农牧民已经走上了合作化的道路。全县共有四十三个共耕社，包括四千五百户。我们参观了以起义英雄霍里亚命名的共耕社。集体劳动使这个共耕社获得了空前丰收。稞麦和马铃薯的单位面积产量都比解放前增加了两倍多，畜产品也有很大增加。社员们的生活是解放前无法比拟的。社员马代什·约瑟夫在解放前穿的是麻衣、木鞋，常常没有饭吃，全家十二口人挤在一间木房里。现在他每月从共耕社收入两千五百多列伊（罗币），三口人的小家庭住着三间新房子，他和妻子有二十多件衣服。
    许多木器手工业者也组织起来了。“霍里亚—摩茨”木器生产合作社新建了两个大厂房，并且开始用机器代替手工操作。这个合作社有两台运木材的拖拉机。他们的产品可以用自己的两辆载重汽车直接运到国家收购站。社员每月的平均收入有八百列伊。但是，在解放前，这些手工业者为了推销自己的产品，不得不到处奔波。有许多人穷得吃不上饭，回不了家，被迫流落各地。
    矿工的劳动条件和生活状况发生了巨大变化。在解放前，矿工的安全毫无保障，不知有多少人在矿坑中葬送了生命。那时的矿工就像牛马一样，在狭窄泥泞的坑道中驮运矿石。他们为矿主采出了金子，而自己所得的代价却是疾病和饥饿。现在，矿石的开采、运输和加工都基本上实现了机械化。严重的死伤事故已经消灭。矿工的平均工资比金矿国有化前增加了两倍。他们还可以享受到许多福利设施和养老金待遇。
    由于木材的采伐和运输已经部分机械化，伐木工人的繁重劳动也大大减轻了。他们每月的平均工资已经达到一千列伊。解放前许多伐木工人都没有房子住，解放以来，已经有80％的伐木工人盖了新房子。
    “摩茨”人已不再满足于那种简陋的小木房，最近多半用砖石水泥修建坚固美观的成套住宅。这个地区的房子有将近一半都是在解放后新建的。在休息日，你可以看到“摩茨”人穿的衣服质量并不亚于城市人所穿的，只是衣服的式样有些特点罢了。
    在解放前的克姆别尼县，除去只能制造木桶的手工业外，没有任何工业。现在已经有三家木材厂，还建立了采石、面包、水果加工等工厂。在解放前，这里的商业也极不发达。人们往往无法卖出想卖的产品，买不到想买的东西。现在全县有一百五十多个国营商店、消费合作社和合作商店，已经形成了一个生意兴隆的商业网。
    在解放前，电灯对“摩茨”人来说还是件新奇东西，但现在全县已经有半数以上的乡镇装上了电灯。这里的交通也比解放前方便多了，现在公共汽车通达每个乡镇，还有一条小铁路通到这里。
    文化卫生的硕果
    解放后，“摩茨”人的文化卫生面貌焕然一新。
    在解放前，克姆别尼县文盲占75％，一所中学也没有，小学也只有二十六所。现在中、小学校已经增加到一百一十八所，并且在1956年就全部扫除了文盲。在解放前，没有一个工农子弟能上大学，现在每年都有五十名以上的中学生升入高等学校学习。在解放前，全县只有一个电影院、两个文化馆。现在电影院增加了九倍，文化馆增加了十六倍，还在七十六个村中设立了图书室。劳动人民学习文化的热情愈来愈高。有许多人还很喜爱中国文学。我们在一个图书馆里看到，马烽和西戎著的“吕梁英雄传”译本已被翻得很破旧了。图书管理员说，这是一本极受读者欢迎的小说。
    随着文化水平的提高，“摩茨”人的文艺生活也活跃起来了。目前全县有八十三个歌舞队、戏剧队、艺术宣传队和民间乐器合奏队。这些组织在解放前是完全没有的。去年他们选出了最优秀的演员参加了全国第五次文艺会演。他们演奏的长筒牧笛获得了二等奖。现在全县正在进行第二次戏剧比赛活动。
    “姑娘会”是“摩茨”人的一个传统节日。每年7月17日，许多“摩茨”姑娘都打扮得漂漂亮亮，走上格伊纳山顶。当然，和她们同时到达的还有成批的小伙子。他们之中，有许多人就在这里一见倾心，成为终身伴侣。
    最近几年来，“姑娘会”的活动内容更加丰富多采了。它不但为相处遥远的青年男女提供了结识和恋爱的机会，也成了全县进行文艺会演和物资交流的日子。去年的“姑娘会”盛况空前，从各地来参加的有五千多人。
    在解放前，克姆别尼县有70％以上的居民害肺病或染有梅毒，婴儿死亡率高达17％。那时，全县只有一个医院，三个保健站。现在有三个拥有五百多个床位的医院和十五个保健站，还设立了十一个在解放前所没有的产院。目前全县有二百八十九名医务人员，比解放前增加了十倍多。由于医疗机构和医务人员大大增加，“摩茨”人的健康情况很快好转了。现在已经基本上消灭了肺病和梅毒，婴儿死亡率年年降低。这个县在过去是全州婴儿死亡率最高的县，现在已经成为婴儿死亡率最低的县，去年全县生下的成千的婴儿全部都活了。
    （注）“道伊那”是一种曲调忧伤的民歌。
