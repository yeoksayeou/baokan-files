Using Military Blocs to Plan War Preparations
U.S. Imperialism Intensifies Challenges to Peace

Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Holds Air Force Exercise
U.S. Actually Wants Japan and the Chiang and Rhee Cliques to Participate

Xinhua News Agency, February 19th dispatch from U.S. Clark Air Base in the Philippines: The United States has "invited" the air forces of Japan, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and the Syngman Rhee clique to jointly conduct a "modern fighter exercise" with member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

Participating in the exercise from the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization are the United States, the Philippines, Thailand, New Zealand, and Australia. The South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem clique will also send observers.

This time, the United States actually "invited" Japan, which just signed a military alliance with it, as well as the Chiang and Rhee cliques to participate in the exercise, indicating that the de facto Northeast Asian military alliance has begun military collusion with the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. This once again exposes the aggressive threat of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" to Asia.

Holding Military Conference to Draft Exercise Plans
North Atlantic Treaty Organization Activities Frequent

Xinhua News Agency, February 18th dispatch from Norfolk, Virginia: Under the auspices of the United States, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization recently held a number of meetings to plan war preparations.

On the 15th and 16th, a military training conference of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was held in Norfolk. The meeting reviewed plans for a series of military exercises to be held in 1960 and drafted military exercise plans for a three-year period starting in 1961. The meeting was presided over by the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic of the group, U.S. Navy Admiral Wright.

The meeting carefully studied plans to increase the "mobility of maritime patrol forces" of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states.

It was revealed that the group will hold "countless maritime exercises" in 1960, with the "climax" being a set of combat exercises in the eastern Atlantic and Norwegian Sea areas this autumn.

Prior to this meeting, Wright also presided over a North Atlantic Treaty Organization "anti-submarine warfare" conference. At this meeting, Wright emphasized the important role of submarines in "future world wars." The week-long meeting also heard several reports on the group's naval war preparations, including a report by the former commander of the U.S. Navy's nuclear submarine "Seadragon" on the activities of U.S. submarines in the Arctic region. Not long ago, the U.S. Navy's nuclear submarine "Halibut" also went to the Arctic region to map areas that could be used for military operations.

In the month and a half since the beginning of this year, the United States has conducted seven provocative military exercises with its vassal states. In addition, the United States also jointly conducted a provocative exercise in the Taiwan Strait with the Chiang Kai-shek clique's army in early February, and is scheduled to jointly hold amphibious exercises in Tainan at the end of this month or next month.

Desperately Encouraging the Central Treaty Organization
U.S. Air Force Conducts Exercise in Karachi

Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, February 17th: Twenty-two U.S. tactical air force aircraft, led by Major General Henry Vicello, commander of the 19th Air Force of the U.S. Tactical Air Command, held an "aerial display" and "ground exhibition" at Karachi's Mauripur Airport this morning.

Generals from the Central Treaty Organization's Permanent Military Group watched the "performance," including air force or army generals from the United States, Britain, Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan.

This action by the U.S. Air Force is one of a series of "performances" they plan to hold in the three Asian member states (Iran, Turkey, Pakistan) of the Central Treaty Organization.

U.S. military personnel have also been engaged in a series of other activities in the region recently. It is reported that during the activities of the U.S. military delegation led by Palmer, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Forces in Europe, in Pakistan and Iran in mid-January, they discussed "concrete steps to strengthen cooperation among allies" with the relevant governments. The delegation also inspected strategic strongholds and military installations in some parts of Pakistan. Following this, James Lee, commander of the U.S. Middle East Naval Forces, visited East Pakistan and inspected the naval base in Chittagong.

    利用军事集团策划备战活动
    美帝国主义加紧向和平挑战
    东南亚集团举行空军演习
    美国竟要日本和蒋李集团参加
    据新华社19日讯　菲律宾克拉克美军基地消息：美国已经“邀请”日本、蒋介石集团和李承晚集团的空军同东南亚侵略集团的成员国联合举行一次“现代战斗机演习”。
    参加演习的东南亚条约组织的成员国是美国、菲律宾、泰国、新西兰和澳大利亚。南越吴庭艳集团也将派观察员参加。
    美国这一次竟然“邀请”刚刚同它签订了军事同盟的日本以及蒋李集团参加演习，说明已经在事实上形成的东北亚军事同盟开始和东南亚侵略集团进行军事勾结。这又一次暴露了新的日美“安全条约”对亚洲的侵略威胁。
    召开军事会议拟订演习计划
    北大西洋集团活动频繁
    新华社18日讯　美国弗吉尼亚州诺福克消息：在美国的主持下，北大西洋集团最近举行了一些策划备战活动的会议。
    在15和16日，在诺福克举行了北大西洋集团的军事训练会议。这个会议审查了1960年举行一系列军事演习的计划，并且拟订了从1961年起为期三年的军事演习计划。会议由这个集团的大西洋盟军最高司令、美国海军上将赖特主持。
    会议仔细研究了增加北大西洋集团成员国“海上巡逻部队机动性”的计划。
    据透露，这个集团在1960年将举行“无数次的海上演习”，“最高潮”是今年秋天在大西洋东部和挪威海区域进行的一套作战演习。
    在这次会议以前，赖特还主持了北大西洋集团的“反潜艇战”会议。赖特在这个会议上强调了潜艇在“今后世界大战”中的重要作用。这个开了一星期的会议还听取了几个有关这个集团的海军备战活动的报告，其中包括美国海军的原子能潜艇“鳐鱼号”前艇长所作的关于美国潜艇在北极地区的活动情况。不久以前，美国海军的原子能潜艇“棘鬣鱼号”又曾到北极地区绘制可能进行军事行动的地区的地图。
    今年年初以来的一个半月内，美国已经同它的仆从国家进行了七次挑衅性的军事演习。另外，美国在2月初还同台湾蒋介石集团军队联合在台湾海峡举行了挑衅性演习，并且预订在这个月底或下月在台南联合举行两栖演习。
    拼命为中央条约组织打气
    美国空军在卡拉奇演习
    新华社卡拉奇17日电　由美国战术空军司令部第十九航空队司令亨利·维塞洛少将率领的二十二架美国战术空军飞机今天上午在卡拉奇毛里普尔机场举行了“空中表演”和“地面展览”。
    观看这次“表演”的有中央条约组织常设军事小组的将领们，其中包括美国、英国、伊朗、土耳其和巴基斯坦的空军或陆军的将领。
    美国空军的这一行动是它们在中央条约组织三个亚洲成员国（伊朗、土耳其、巴基斯坦）计划举行的一系列“表演”中的一次。
    美国军事人员最近在这个地区也进行了一系列其他的活动。据报道，由美国驻欧洲部队副总司令帕麦尔率领的美国军事代表团1月中在巴基斯坦和伊朗进行活动期间，曾经同有关政府讨论了“盟国间加强合作的具体步骤”。这个代表团还在巴基斯坦一些地方视察了战略据点和军事设施。在这以后，美国驻中东海军部队司令詹姆斯·李曾到东巴基斯坦活动，在吉大港视察了海军基地。
