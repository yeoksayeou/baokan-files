Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 21st — According to reports in the local newspapers, a major fire broke out in Selat Panjang, Central Sumatra, on the 14th. Over 400 shops in the town center were destroyed, 90% of which were owned by Overseas Chinese.

The majority of the residents in this town are Overseas Chinese, totaling about 5,000 people. Recently, they have been affected by the Indonesian government's regulations prohibiting foreign small traders from operating in rural areas, making it impossible for them to make a living, and they have been applying to return to China one after another. After this fire, they have lost all their possessions, and their difficulties have increased.

In the past month, two fires have occurred in some Indonesian towns where Overseas Chinese residents make up the majority. The last fire occurred in Pontianak, West Kalimantan, leaving more than 5,000 Overseas Chinese homeless, with estimated losses of 1 billion rupiahs.
