Xinhua News Agency, 10th – In the spirit of "early in everything," the People's Communes in southern provinces (municipalities) and regions have begun various preparations for early rice sowing ahead of schedule. Currently, provinces and regions such as Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Jiangxi have begun large-scale nursery bed preparation, fertilizer delivery, and plowing, and have started rice seedling cultivation. In the early cultivated nursery beds, the tender green seedling shoots have grown to more than two inches high. In Hainan Island, where the season is earlier, hundreds of thousands of mu of early rice have already been planted.

The larger-scale spring plowing production of 1960 begins with early rice. Like wheat, this year, southern regions will greatly expand the planting area of early rice. Because planting more early rice can increase the proportion of summer harvest grains, it can free up stubble land for late rice, and planting more late rice can also avoid the threats of typhoons and droughts in July and August, achieving stable and high yields. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the preliminary arrangements for the early rice planting area in the thirteen southern provinces, municipalities, and regions are all larger than in previous years.遂昌Suichang County in Zhejiang Province is changing its cropping system and increasing the multiple cropping index. This year, the early rice area has expanded from 100,000 mu last year to 200,000 mu. In some areas, the early rice planting area has been assigned to the communes and production teams. The stubble arrangement for early rice fields in various regions is also generally better than in previous years. In Hubei Province, fallow fields account for 50%, and green manure fields account for 30%.

With the experience of the two years of the Great Leap Forward, the People's Communes in various regions have greater confidence and enthusiasm in striving for a bumper harvest of early rice this year. In accordance with the requirements of fully implementing the "Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture," they have made early preparations for plowing, soil improvement, fertilizers, water conservancy, seeds, and tools. Except for some early rice fields that have not been plowed due to the planting of green manure and other crops, the general early rice fields in various regions were plowed in the autumn and winter of last year, with a plowing depth of about six inches. This year, the fertilizer prepared for early rice is more and better than in previous years. In Jiangxi Province, in addition to more than 260 dan of fertilizer per mu of cultivated land, almost every mu of early rice also has one mu of green manure. The Liyuan People's Commune in Yizhang County, Hunan Province, plans to sow more than three times the area of early rice this year compared to last year. Farm work such as water conservancy, fertilizers, and seeds were completed in advance last winter. An average of 400 dan of high-quality fertilizer per mu has been delivered to the field-side fertilizer storage, and all 3,000 mu of nursery beds have been plowed and harrowed three to four times. Due to large-scale water conservancy projects, the area of early rice guaranteed against drought and flood has greatly increased. In eight provinces and regions, including Jiangsu, Hunan, Hubei, and Guangdong, the area of early rice guaranteed against drought and flood this year reaches 85%. The supply of early rice seeds in Hunan, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces is sufficient, and areas with insufficient seeds are actively solving the problem by mobilizing the masses to exchange seeds, etc.

In the preparation of early rice planting work, various regions have also planned the area and measures for high-yield early rice fields as early as possible, according to the spirit of grasping both ends and bringing along the middle. The area of high-yield early rice fields arranged in seven provinces and regions, including Jiangsu, Fujian, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi, accounts for 20% to 30% of the area of general fields. For some low-yield fields, various regions have taken measures to improve them by combining plowing with soil improvement, increasing fertilizer application, and draining cold water in order to increase their yield per unit area.

At present, various regions are also actively launching shock activities for various preparations to lay a good foundation for a bumper harvest of early rice. Guangdong Province, which has the largest early rice planting area, has proposed to seize early sowing and early transplanting, planning to sow 15 days earlier than in previous years and complete all transplanting before the Qingming Festival; to seize rational close planting, reaching 300,000 spikes per mu. Hunan Province, which ranks second in the country in early rice planting area, has formulated eight measures, including grasping low-yield fields and high-yield fields, grasping water and fertilizer, grasping rational close planting, field management, and tool reform, striving for a bumper harvest of early rice.

### 发展两年大跃进的经验　打好今年大丰收的基础  南方扩大早稻种植面积  提早做好贯彻农业八字宪法的各项准备，抓紧改造低产田和搞好丰产田

    发展两年大跃进的经验　打好今年大丰收的基础
    南方扩大早稻种植面积
    提早做好贯彻农业八字宪法的各项准备，抓紧改造低产田和搞好丰产田
    新华社10日讯　南方各省（市）、区人民公社本着一早百早的精神，提前开始了早稻播种的各项准备工作。目前，福建、广东、广西、四川、江西等省区已经大规模整理秧田、送肥、耕田，开始育秧。早育的秧田，嫩绿的秧针已长到两寸多高。季节较早的海南岛，已插下早稻几十万亩。
    1960年的更大规模的春耕生产从早稻开始了。同小麦一样，今年南方各地都将大大地扩大早稻的种植面积。因为多种早稻可以增产夏收粮食的比重，可以为晚稻腾出茬口，多种晚稻，还可以避免7、8月暴风雨和干旱的威胁，达到稳产保收。据农业部了解，南方十三个省、市、区初步安排的早稻种植面积，都比往年扩大了。浙江遂昌县改变耕作制度，提高复种指数，今年早稻面积由去年的十万亩扩大到二十万亩。有的地区早稻种植面积已落实到公社和生产队。各地早稻田的茬口安排，一般也比往年好。湖北省休闲田占50％，绿肥田占30％。
    各地人民公社有两年大跃进的经验，对争取今年早稻丰收的信心和干劲都更大，根据全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”的要求，提前进行了耕翻、改良土壤、肥料、水利、种子和工具各项准备工作。除部分早稻田因种植了绿肥等作物没有耕翻以外，各地一般早稻田都在去年秋季和冬季耕翻过，耕翻的深度大都在六寸左右。今年为早稻准备的肥料比往年又多又好。江西省除每亩耕地备有肥料二百六十多担外，几乎每亩早稻还有一亩绿肥。湖南省宜章县栗源人民公社今年计划播种的早稻面积比去年扩大三倍多，水利、肥料、种子等农活在去冬就提前完成了，每亩平均有优质肥四百担已送到田边肥库，三千亩秧田全部犁耙了三次到四次。由于大兴水利，早稻旱涝保丰收的面积大大增加。江苏、湖南、湖北、广东等八个省区，今年早稻旱涝保收的面积达85％。湖南、浙江、江西、福建四省早稻种子已经准备充足，有的种子不足的地方正在采取发动群众串换等办法积极地解决。
    各地在准备早稻种植工作中，还根据抓两头带中间的精神，及早地规划了早稻丰产田的面积和措施，江苏、福建、湖北、湖南、江西、广东、广西七个省区安排的早稻丰产田的面积，都占一般田面积的20％到30％。对于一部分低产田，各地已采取结合耕翻改良土壤、增施肥料、排除冷水等措施加以改良，以便提高它们的单位面积产量。
    目前，各地还在积极突击各项准备工作，为早稻丰收打下良好的基础。种植早稻面积最大的广东省，提出抓早播、早插秧，计划比往年提早十五天播种，在清明前全部插完秧；抓合理密植，每亩达到三十万穗。早稻种植面积占全国第二位的湖南省，订出抓好低产田和丰产田、抓好水和肥、抓好合理密植、田间管理、工具改革等八项措施，力争早稻大丰收。
