Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 8th. Based on Michurin's theories, the young farmer Nie Shoumao has preliminarily cultivated a promising new variety of cotton by using the wild plant "Okra" and Daizi cotton for distant hybridization. This cotton variety has the characteristics of resisting pests such as aphids, red spiders, and leafhoppers. At the first Jiangxi Provincial Representative Meeting of Socialist Advanced Units, it was officially named "Insect-Resistant Cotton." Recently, Nie Shoumao has been hired as a special researcher by the Jiangxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Nie Shoumao is a member of the Lefeng Brigade of the Shuanggang People's Commune in Boyang County, Jiangxi. Last year, the brigade planted the second generation seeds of "Insect-Resistant Cotton" on 1.4 mu of land, and harvested a total of 580 jin of seed cotton in the autumn. Judging from the harvest of that year, the ginning outturn and fiber length of this cotton exceeded that of Daizi cotton. The average ginning outturn reached over 40%. Furthermore, according to actual measurements of 230 cotton bolls, the highest ginning outturn reached 53.52%, and the lowest was 38%. The cotton fiber generally reached over 32 millimeters in length, with the shortest being 28 millimeters and the longest being 38 millimeters. This year, the Shuanggang Commune plans to expand the planting of this new cotton to 32 mu for further cultivation and experimentation.

Last autumn, the Jiangxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences conducted a scientific appraisal of "Insect-Resistant Cotton," and concluded that this cotton variety has excellent characteristics such as insect resistance (resistance to leafhoppers, aphids, and red spiders), cold resistance, drought resistance, and high yield. It was believed that Nie Shoumao's creative labor in cultivating this cotton seed has significant meaning in scientific research, further enriching the theory of distant hybridization of plants. It also proves once again that the workers and peasants have unlimited creative genius.

In July 1955, while participating in the brigade's efforts to eliminate cotton pests, Nie Shoumao conceived the idea of cultivating a new cotton variety that was not afraid of pests and began to conduct some experiments. One day, while he was discussing how to resist cotton pests with a commune member next to a rock, he discovered a plant with yellow flowers, leaves and fruits very similar to cotton growing beside the rock. Strangely, this plant growing next to the cotton had not been eaten by insects like the cotton and was growing very vigorously. Just then, an old man came up to them. He quickly stepped forward and asked, "Grandpa, what kind of flower is this? What is it used for?" The old man told him, "This thing is called 'Seven Leaves, One Flower,' it is a poisonous grass, and it is often used as snake medicine." Nie Shoumao was so happy when he heard the old man's words that he almost jumped up. He decided to pollinate Daizi cotton with the pollen of "Seven Leaves, One Flower" to experiment with cultivating new cotton seeds.

"Seven Leaves, One Flower" is "Okra," belonging to the Malvaceae family, Hibiscus genus. Another local name for it is "Snake Grass," which is a poisonous wild plant, so insects dare not bite it.

Nie Shoumao's first experiment with distant hybridization of "Okra" and Daizi cotton was at the end of August 1955. Local cotton is divided into early cotton and late cotton, early cotton is sown in March and late cotton is sown in June. This time he used late cotton for hybridization, and as a result, two cotton bolls were formed. He was extremely happy and carefully put paper covers on these two cotton bolls to prevent them from being blown off by the wind. Unfortunately, some children in the village saw them with "paper hats," found them very interesting, and picked them off along with the peaches. Therefore, he conducted the hybridization experiment again in the second half of September. This time, two more cotton bolls were formed, and ten seeds were harvested.

In the spring of 1956, he sowed these ten seeds, and when the seedlings grew, they looked exactly like Daizi cotton, with no changes. This time, he was a little discouraged. However, the encouragement of the Party gave him the courage to continue the experiment. He searched through materials everywhere, and finally learned from Michurin's theories on fruit tree hybridization that the cotton bolls he had hybridized in the past were all late-stage, with strong genetic conservatism, so there was no variation.

In 1957, he hybridized more than 400 early-stage flowers in one go, resulting in 24 cotton bolls and 110 seeds. On February 28, 1958, he sowed the first generation of new varieties. The growth of the new varieties increasingly showed significant variations, being neither like the "mother" nor the "father." The fruit branches were not as long as those of Daizi cotton, but were relatively short, making them very suitable for close planting. The leaves were pointed, unlike the oval shape of Daizi cotton. Generally, cotton stems are purplish-red, but its stems were green. It also produced many cotton bolls. From spring to autumn, aphids, red spiders, and leafhoppers severely damaged Daizi cotton, but they dared not run rampant on the new varieties. This is because the new varieties inherited the characteristics of Okra, with poisonous sap in the leaves and more pubescence on the back of the leaves, so insects dared not eat it.

The news of Nie Shoumao's preliminary success in cultivating new cotton seeds received high praise and attention from the provincial, prefectural, and county Party and government leaders. The county assigned special personnel to help him summarize his experience and formulate new research plans. The Provincial Department of Agriculture allocated many experimental instruments and funds. Shao Shiping, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor of Jiangxi Province, personally wrote a letter instructing the Shangrao Prefectural Committee to support Nie Shoumao's experiment in every possible way.

While sowing the first generation seeds of "Insect-Resistant Cotton" in 1958, Nie Shoumao also hybridized "Okra" and Daizi cotton to cultivate some first generation seeds again. In 1959, while sowing the second generation seeds, he also planted the first generation seeds that were cultivated for the second time. As a result, both batches of seeds had common characteristics. In addition to insect resistance, they also had cold resistance and drought resistance.

Nie Shoumao is not satisfied with the achievements he has already made. He discovered that insect-resistant cotton cannot eliminate the pests in the cotton fruits, so he continues to study it. Last year, he successfully hybridized gourds, pumpkins, and cotton, hoping to obtain a new insect-free, high-yielding variety through this new experiment.

Nie Shoumao is twenty-eight years old this year. He worked for landlords since he was a child and only attended school for two years. After liberation, when mutual aid teams were established, he was elected as the team leader. When the primary agricultural cooperative was established, he was again elected as a farmer technician. In the spring of 1955, he studied at the Shangrao Agricultural School for three months and mastered some basic agricultural technical knowledge.

    工农群众的创造天才充实了植物远缘杂交的理论
    聂寿茂培育“抗虫棉”初步成功
    新品种用“秋葵”和岱字棉杂交、具有抗虫、抗寒、抗旱和丰产等特性
    据新华社南昌8日电　青年农民聂寿茂根据米丘林学说，利用野生植物“秋葵”和岱字棉进行远缘杂交，初步培育出了一种有希望的新品种棉花。这种棉花具有抗蚜虫、红蜘蛛、叶跳虫等虫害的特性，在江西省首届社会主义先进单位代表会议上，被正式命名为“抗虫棉”。最近聂寿茂已被中国科学院江西分院聘为特约研究员。
    聂寿茂是江西波阳县双港人民公社乐丰大队的社员。这个社去年在一亩四分地上播种了“抗虫棉”的第二代种子，秋天共收籽棉五百八十斤。从这一年的收获情况看，这种棉花，衣分率和纤维长度都超过了岱字棉。平均衣分率达40％以上，另据二百三十株棉花的单铃实测，衣分率最高的达53．52％，最低的38％；棉絮纤维一般长达三十二毫米以上，最短的二十八毫米，最长的三十八毫米。今年双港公社对这种新棉准备扩大种植到三十二亩，作进一步的培育和试验。
    中国科学院江西分院去年秋天对“抗虫棉”进行了科学鉴定，认为这种棉花有抗虫（抗叶跳虫、蚜虫、红蜘蛛）、抗寒、抗旱和丰产等优良特性；认为聂寿茂培育这种棉种的创造性劳动，在科学研究上有重大意义，进一步充实了植物远缘杂交的理论；也再一次证明了工农群众有无限创造天才。
    1955年7月，聂寿茂在参加社里消灭棉花害虫中，就产生了培养一种不怕虫害的新棉种的理想，并开始进行一些试验。一天，他同一个社员坐在岩石旁边讲起抗御棉花虫害的时候，在岩石边发现一株开着黄花、叶和果很像棉花的一种植物。奇怪的是这株生长在棉花旁边的植物却没有像棉花那样被虫吃过，长得非常茂盛。恰好迎面来了一个老人。他就急忙上前问道：“老公公，这是什么花？有什么用？”老人告诉他：“这个东西叫‘七叶一支花’，是一种有毒的草，常拿它来当蛇药用。”聂寿茂听了老人的话，高兴得几乎跳起来。他决定用“七叶一支花”的花粉给岱字棉授粉，试验培育新棉种。
    “七叶一支花”就是“秋葵”，属锦葵科，木锦属，它的另一个土名叫“蛇草”，是一种有毒的野生植物，因此虫子不敢咬它。
    聂寿茂第一次试验“秋葵”和岱字棉远缘杂交，是在1955年8月末。当地的棉花分早棉和晚棉，早棉在3月播种，晚棉在6月播种。他这次是用晚棉进行杂交的，结果结了两个棉铃。他高兴极了，细心地给这两个棉铃套上了纸套，防止被风吹落。不幸得很，村里的一些小孩看见它们带着“纸帽子”，很好玩，便连桃都给摘去了。因此他在9月下半月又再次进行了杂交试验。这次又结了两个棉铃，收到了十粒种籽。
    1956年春天，他把这十粒种籽播下去，等长出苗来一看，还是和岱字棉一个样儿，看不出有什么变化。这回他有些泄气了。但是，党的鼓励，使他重新鼓起继续试验的勇气，到处翻阅资料，终于从介绍米丘林的有关果树杂交的理论中，知道了他过去杂交的棉铃都是后期的，遗传保守性强，所以才没有变异。
    1957年他一口气杂交了四百多个前期的花朵，结果结了二十四个棉桃，得到了一百一十粒种籽。1958年2月28日，他播下了第一代新的品种。新品种的生长日益表现出显著的变异，既不像“母亲”，也不像“父亲”，果枝不像岱字棉那样长，而是比较短，很适合密植；叶是尖形的，不像岱字棉那样的椭圆形；一般棉花茎是紫红色的，它的茎是青色的；结的棉铃也很多。从春到秋，蚜虫、红蜘蛛、叶跳虫把岱字棉吃的很厉害，可是在新的品种上却不敢为非作歹。因为新品种继承了秋葵的特性，叶子里有毒汁，叶背面有较多的茸毛，虫子不敢吃它。
    聂寿茂培育新棉种初步成功的消息，得到省、专区、县党政领导的很高评价和重视。县里指派专人帮助他总结经验，订出新的研究规划。省农业厅专门拨给许多试验仪器和经费。中共江西省委书记、省长邵式平亲自写信，指示上饶地委要他们千方百计支持聂寿茂的试验。
    聂寿茂在1958年播下“抗虫棉”第一代种子的同时，又用“秋葵”和岱字棉杂交，再次培育出一些第一代种子。1959年在播种第二代种子的同时，也种了第二次培育出的第一代种子，结果两次培育出的种子都有共同的特性。除抗虫外，还有抗寒和抗旱的性能。
    聂寿茂并不满足已得的成就，他发现抗虫棉还不能消除棉花果实里的害虫，就继续进行钻研，去年他用葫芦、南瓜和棉花进行杂交成功，希望通过这种新试验能得出一个无虫高产的新品种。
    聂寿茂今年二十八岁。从小就给地主做工，只念过两年书。解放后成立互助组时，他被选为组长。成立初级农业社时，又被推选为农民技术员。1955年春天，他到上饶农业学校学习了三个月，掌握了一些基本的农业技术知识。
