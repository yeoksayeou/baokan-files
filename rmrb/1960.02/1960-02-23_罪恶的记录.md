Record of Sins

On the eve of his visit to South America, Eisenhower said, "Throughout history, no country has had a more decent record in dealing with other countries than the United States," and that the United States "has decently and consistently pursued a policy of non-interference throughout Latin America."

Is this really the case? The facts show that the United States' so-called "non-interference policy" and so-called "decent record" amount to more than one hundred territorial annexations and military aggressions against Latin American countries over the past century, and a series of coups and rebellions instigated in Latin America in the past ten years or more since the war.

In addition to the interference activities against Cuba in the past year or so, the United States has been constantly instigating subversive activities in Latin American countries since 1951. The following is a part of its record of sins:

	May 1951, instigated a fascist coup in Bolivia led by Baivian.
	March 1952, instigated a coup in Cuba, bringing the dictator Batista to power.
	June 1954, instigated Armas to lead troops from Honduras to invade Guatemala, forcing President Arbenz to step down.
	August 1954, instigated reactionary Brazilian officers to launch a coup, forcing President Vargas to commit suicide.
	Second half of 1954, plotted a coup in Mexico, but it was crushed by the people's forces.
	January 1955, drove the Nicaraguan dictator Somoza to launch an attack on Costa Rica, but was repelled.
	May 1955, plotted a conspiracy in Chile to dissolve the parliament and establish a military dictatorship, but it was crushed by democratic forces.
	October and November 1955, instigated Filo Luz to stage a coup in Brazil, which was crushed.
	July 1958, instigated Defense Minister Castro-Leon in Venezuela to stage a military coup, but it was crushed by the people.
	July 1958, instigated a military coup in Haiti, which ended in a惨 defeat.
	July 1958, plotted and directed a military coup in Argentina led by Rial, commander of the Buenos Aires Naval District, which was crushed by the people.
	September 1958, instigated a coup by the constabulary in Venezuela led by Estrada, the head of the secret police, but it was suppressed by the military government.
	November 1958, plotted a coup by reactionary officers in Venezuela, plotting to restore the dictatorship, which ended in a惨 defeat.
	February 1959, instigated riots in Venezuela, which were crushed.
	April 1959, instigated riots in Bolivia, which were crushed. Latin American fever is killing me! (Originally published in the Uruguayan "People's Daily")

    罪恶的记录
    艾森豪威尔在访问南美前夕说，“在整个历史上，没有一个国家在同其他国家打交道方面有比美国体面的记录”，美国“在整个拉丁美洲体面地、坚持不渝地奉行不干涉政策”。
    真是这样吗？事实却说明：美国的所谓“不干涉政策”和所谓“体面记录”，就是一百多年来对拉丁美洲各国进行一百多次的领土兼并，军事侵略，就是战后十多年来在拉丁美洲制造的一连串的政变和叛乱。
    除了近一年多来对古巴的干涉活动外，从1951年以来，美国在拉丁美洲国家不断策动颠复活动。下面就是它的罪恶记录的一部分：
    1951年5月，在玻利维亚策动以巴伊维昂为首的法西斯政变。
    1952年3月，策动古巴政变，使独裁者巴蒂斯塔上台。
    1954年6月，策动阿马斯从洪都拉斯引兵入侵危地马拉，阿本斯总统被迫去职。
    1954年8月，策动巴西反动军官发动政变，瓦加斯总统被迫自杀。
    1954年下半年，在墨西哥策划政变，但被人民力量粉碎。
    1955年1月，驱使尼加拉瓜独裁者索摩查向哥斯达黎加发动进攻，但被击退。
    1955年5月，在智利策划一个解散议会，建立军事独裁的阴谋，但被民主力量粉碎。
    1955年10月、11月，在巴西策动菲洛·卢斯举行政变，被粉碎。
    1958年7月，在委内瑞拉策动国防部长卡斯特罗—莱昂举行军事政变，但被人民粉碎。
    1958年7月，在海地策动军事政变，遭惨败。
    1958年7月，在阿根廷策划和指挥以布宜诺斯艾利斯海军军区司令里亚尔为首的反动集团发动军事政变，被人民粉碎。
    1958年9月，在委内瑞拉策动以秘密警察头子埃斯特腊达为首的宪兵政变，但被军政府镇压下去。
    1958年11月，在委内瑞拉策划反动军官政变，阴谋恢复独裁统治，遭惨败。
