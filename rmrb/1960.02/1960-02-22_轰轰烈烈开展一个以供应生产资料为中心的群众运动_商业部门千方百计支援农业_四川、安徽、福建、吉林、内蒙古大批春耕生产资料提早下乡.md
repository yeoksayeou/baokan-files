Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu: Sichuan Province's commercial departments, in organizing spring plowing production materials, have increased the supply of new and improved planting, rice transplanting, harvesting, irrigation, and agricultural and sideline product processing machinery.

For large-scale new agricultural machinery, commercial departments organize production and supply according to the principle of "complete set production, complete supply, timely allocation and transportation, and guaranteed use." The first batch of more than 23,900 horsepower irrigation and drainage machinery has been transported to rural areas and put into production, and the machine, pump, belt, and pipe are fully equipped, and are adjusted and transported with production, and installed with matching.

Commercial departments actively help people's communes run commune-run factories, produce and modify new farm tools, and promote the improvement and semi-mechanization of farm tools required for harvesting small spring crops and planting large spring crops. The commercial department of the Nanchong Special District started with arranging labor, providing technical equipment and raw materials, and assisted more than 650 iron and wood factories and more than 4,500 farm tool production groups in the district to produce more than 3,200 kinds of new and improved farm tools and tools, a total of more than 4.6 million pieces. The commercial department sent people to participate in the technical innovation committees established by the county, district, and commune, and organized factories to produce 25 kinds of farm tools such as deep plows, rice transplanters, rice planters, and improved waterwheels, a total of more than 100,000 pieces, with an average of 32 pieces per production team.

Commercial departments have also done a lot of support work for technical innovations in rural sideline production, pig raising, agricultural and sideline product processing, and canteen cooking. In the first quarter, the province plans to supply nearly 180,000 various transportation vehicles to rural areas, more than 50,000 pig raising equipment such as feed crushers, green feed cutters, and manual grass rollers, and also organized various machinery factories to produce 150,000 slicing, shredding, and vegetable cutting cooking tools, more than 2,700 rice milling machines and universal steel mills in the near future, to supply rural people's communes. In this way, the commune will be able to extract more labor into spring plowing production.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei: Commercial, industrial, and banking departments in Anhui Province have taken various measures to actively support the spring agricultural production of the people's communes. Up to now, the amount of chemical fertilizers transferred to counties and people's communes throughout the province has increased by 41% compared with the same period last year, and pesticides have increased by 110% compared with the same period last year. A large number of fine varieties of rice, cotton, peanuts, and corn have also been adjusted in various parts of the province. Local bank departments and people's commune credit cooperatives have issued a total of more than 8 million yuan in loans. Factories in various places have newly manufactured and modified a large number of farm tools.

The planned sowing area of spring crops such as rice, sweet potatoes, corn, cotton, hemp, and tobacco in Anhui Province this year is much larger than last year. In order to meet the needs of spring sowing, in addition to the provincial commercial department organizing large factories to produce in batches, the commercial departments of various counties also actively organize county and commune industries to produce chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and various farm tools for spring planting. The commercial department and industrial department of Shou County cooperated closely, and many kinds of farm tools have overfulfilled the scheduled production targets. As of February 5, the county's 64 machinery, farm tool, and woodworking factories have produced more than 40,000 pieces (sets) of water turbines, generators, soil transportation devices, fertilizer transportation vehicles, deep plows, rice transplanters, and waterwheels, and have built 464 new chemical fertilizer factories, producing a large number of calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizers, potassium nitrate and other chemical fertilizers.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou: Commercial departments in various parts of Fujian Province have taken various measures to prepare sufficient spring plowing production materials in advance to support the continued leap forward in agricultural production. Up to now, the supply of various irrigation and drainage machinery in the province has increased by more than double the total supply in the first half of last year; the supply of pesticide machinery and commodity fertilizers has also increased significantly compared with the spring plowing last year.

This year, the preparation and supply of spring plowing production materials by commercial departments in various parts of Fujian Province started earlier and better than in previous years. In organizing the supply of goods, the commercial department paid special attention to giving full play to the role of commune-run industries, and supported the production of agricultural machinery and farm tool factories in various communes from the aspects of raw materials, technical equipment, and funds, which not only expanded the source of goods, but also greatly saved transportation and turnover costs. The commercial department of Xianyou County organized commune-run industries to produce and mobilized commune members to use their spare time to process, and manufactured more than 350,000 pieces of large and small farm tools in one month, so that the county prepared sufficient spring plowing farm tools as early as the end of January. The commercial department of Chong'an County helped various processing workshops in the county to find a large number of substitutes for making palm clothes, and wove more than 50,000 pieces of palm clothes in more than one month, which not only supplied themselves, but also supported other counties.

The production and promotion of new farm tools and agricultural machinery have been given more attention this year. The province has newly promoted a total of more than 660,000 new farm tools and agricultural machinery such as rice transplanters, seeders, plows, and fertilizer transporters this year, an increase of more than three times compared with the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun: Commercial departments in Jilin Province organize and allocate production materials to support spring plowing production.

The planned supply of spring plowing production materials in the province is 1.3 times higher than the same period last year, and the number of new varieties has increased by more than 50. According to statistics from six counties including Yushu, Yanji, Yongji, Liuhe, Tao'an, and Lishu, the total value of various machinery for land preparation, sowing, and irrigation that has been supplied to rural areas is 1.5 million yuan, which is equal to three times the same period last year. The significant increase in the proportion of agricultural machinery is a feature of the supply of spring plowing production materials in Jilin Province this year. The province plans to supply 200 tractors, 3,186 irrigation and drainage machinery, as well as feed crushers and agricultural and sideline product processing machinery to the communes before spring plowing.

Based on the spirit of self-reliance as the mainstay and striving for external assistance as a supplement, the commercial departments of the province assist local industries in taking local materials, manufacturing farm tools locally, and supplying them locally. As of the end of January, more than 1.9 million pieces of semi-mechanized farm tools and small farm tools arranged for local industrial production have been produced; assisting people's communes in developing the production of local chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and more than 20,000 tons of local chemical fertilizers and pesticides have been produced. Commercial departments also help communes to seize the repair of farm tools.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot: Inner Mongolia's commercial departments actively allocate materials to support agricultural and animal husbandry production. Up to now, the region has allocated more than 3 million pieces (sets) of agricultural and animal husbandry production machinery to agricultural and animal husbandry areas; more than 1,300 tons of pesticides, chemical fertilizers, etc. have also been sent to farmers. According to statistics from the three regions of Jerim League, Xilin Gol League, and Zhaowuda League, the agricultural tools allocated to the People's Commune for cultivating, preparing and planting land this year increased by more than eight times compared with the actual agricultural tools supplied last year.

While allocating a large number of materials, various leagues also organized workers from repair shops to go deep into the people's communes and production teams to repair old production tools. Commercial departments in Ar Horqin Banner, Aohan Banner, and Ongniud Banner in Zhaowuda League organized more than 350 iron and wood workers to go to the production team early to repair farm tools at the end of last year.

The agricultural tool manufacturing plants in various parts of the autonomous region are also doing everything possible to rush to manufacture production machinery for agricultural and animal husbandry production. By mid-January, Tongliao Agricultural Machinery Factory had manufactured more than 20,000 medium and small-sized spring plowing agricultural tools and 2,000 weeding hoes, and successfully trial-produced disc seeders, etc. These machines are now being transported to people's communes in various places.

    轰轰烈烈开展一个以供应生产资料为中心的群众运动
    商业部门千方百计支援农业
    四川、安徽、福建、吉林、内蒙古大批春耕生产资料提早下乡	四川
    据新华社成都讯　四川省商业部门在组织春耕生产资料中，增加了新式和改良的播种、插秧、收割、排灌、农副产品加工机具的供应量。
    对于大型新式农业机械，商业部门根据“成套生产、配套供给、及时调运、保证使用”的原则，组织生产和供应。第一批二万三千九百多马力的排灌机械，已经运往农村投入生产，并且做到了机、泵、带、管配备齐全，随生产随调运，随配套随安装。
    商业部门积极帮助人民公社办好社办工厂，生产和改制新式农具，促使小春作物收割和大春作物栽插需用的农具作到改良化、半机械化。南充专区商业部门从安排劳力、提供技术设备和原料材料等方面入手，协助全区六百五十多个铁木工厂和四千五百多个农具生产小组，制出了各种新式改良农具、工具三千二百多种，共四百六十多万件。商业部门派人参加县、区、公社建立的技术革新委员会，组织工厂生产出深耕犁、平秧器、栽秧机、改良水车等农具二十五种，共十万多件，平均每个生产队可有三十二件。
    对于农村副业生产、养猪、农副产品加工、食堂炊事等方面的技术革新，商业部门也作了许多支援工作。第一季度内，全省计划供应农村的各种运输车辆将近十八万辆，饲料粉碎机、青饲料切割机、人力轧草机等养猪用具五万多部，还组织各机械厂在最近期间生产十五万部切片、切丝、切菜等炊事工具，二千七百多台碾米机和万能钢磨，供应农村人民公社。这样，公社将可以抽出更多的劳力投入春耕生产。	安徽
    据新华社合肥讯　安徽省商业、工业和银行部门采取各种措施，积极支援人民公社的春季农业大生产。到目前止，全省已调运到各县和人民公社的化肥，比去年同期增加41％，农药比去年同期增加110％。在省内各地，还调剂了大量水稻、棉花、花生和玉米等良种。各地银行部门和人民公社信用部共发放了八百多万元贷款。各地工厂新制和改制了大批的农具。
    安徽省今年春播作物水稻、山芋、玉米、棉花、麻类和烟叶等的计划播种面积，都比去年扩大很多。为了满足春播需要，除开省商业部门组织大型工厂成批生产以外，各县商业部门也积极组织县社工业，生产春种用的化肥、农药和各种农具。寿县商业部门和工业部门密切合作，很多种农具已超额实现预定生产指标。到2月5日止，全县六十四个机械、农具、木器等工厂已生产水轮机、发电机、运土器、运肥车、深耕犁、插秧机和水车等四万多件（台），并且新建化肥厂四百六十四座，生产了大批钙镁磷肥、硝酸钾等化肥。	福建
    据新华社福州讯　福建省各地商业部门采取各种措施，提前备足春耕生产资料支援农业生产继续跃进。到目前为止，全省已供应各地的各种排灌机械，比去年上半年的供应总和增加一倍以上；农药械和商品肥料的供应量也比去年春耕时增加很多。
    今年，福建省各地商业部门的春耕生产资料准备和供应工作都比往年动手早，作得好。在组织货源中，商业部门特别注意充分发挥社办工业的作用，从原料、技术设备和资金等方面支援各公社农械、农具工厂的生产，既扩大了货源，又大大节省了运输和周转费用。仙游县商业部门组织社办工业生产和发动社员利用业余时间加工，一个月中就制造出大、小农具三十五万多件，使全县提早在1月底就备足了春耕农具。崇安县商业部门帮助县内各加工工场寻找大批制棕衣的代用品，在一个多月中编制出棕衣五万多件，除了自给以外，还支援了外县。
    新农具和农业机械的生产和推广工作，今年更加得到重视。全省今年新推广的插秧、播种、犁田、运肥等新农具和农业机械共达六十六万多部，比去年同期增加三倍多。	吉林
    据新华社长春讯　吉林省商业部门组织和调运生产资料，支援春耕生产。
    全省计划的春耕生产资料供应额比去年同期增加一点三倍，新品种增加五十多种。据榆树、延吉、永吉、柳河、洮安、梨树六个县统计，目前已供应到农村的整地、播种、排灌等各种机具总值为一百五十万元，等于去年同时期的三倍。农业机械的比重显著增加，是今年吉林省春耕生产资料供应工作的一个特点。全省计划在春耕前供应给公社拖拉机二百台，排灌机械三千一百八十六台，此外还有饲料粉碎机和农副业产品加工机具等等。
    全省商业部门本着自力更生为主、力争外援为辅的精神，协助地方工业就地取材，就地制造农具，就地供应。截至1月底，安排地方工业生产的半机械化农具、小农具已有一百九十多万件；协助人民公社发展土化肥和农药生产，已制出土化肥、土农药两万多吨。商业部门并帮助公社抓紧修配农具。	内蒙古
    据新华社呼和浩特讯　内蒙古商业部门积极调拨物资支援农牧业生产。到目前为止，全区已为农牧业地区调拨了三百多万件（台）农牧业生产机具；一千三百多吨农药、化肥等，也已送到农民手里。据哲里木盟、锡林郭勒盟和昭乌达盟三个地区统计，今年调拨给人民公社的耕地、整地和播种用的农具，比去年实际供应的农具增长八倍多。
    在大量调拨物资的同时，各盟还组织修配厂的工人，深入人民公社和生产队，修配旧的生产工具。昭乌达盟阿鲁科尔沁旗、敖汉旗和翁牛特旗等地的商业部门，去年年底就组织了三百五十多名铁、木工人提早到生产队修配农具。
    自治区各地的农具制造厂，也千方百计地为农牧业生产赶制生产机具。通辽农业机械厂到1月中旬已制造出中小型春耕农具二万多件、耘锄二千台，并试制成功圆盘式播种机等。这些机具，现正源源运往各地人民公社。（附图片）
