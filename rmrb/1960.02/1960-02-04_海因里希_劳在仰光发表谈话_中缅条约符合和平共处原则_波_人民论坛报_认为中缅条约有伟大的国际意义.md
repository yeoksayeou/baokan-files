Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, February 2nd – Heinrich Rau, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign and Intra-German Trade of the German Democratic Republic, and head of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, who is currently visiting here, said that the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression and the Boundary Agreement "fully conform to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and are therefore welcomed by all peace-loving people." Deputy Prime Minister Heinrich Rau said that he represents the government of the German Democratic Republic in congratulating Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and Burmese Prime Minister General Ne Win on the signing of this treaty and agreement.

At a press conference held here this afternoon, Heinrich Rau also expressed the hope that an agreement on resolving the German question can be reached between the two Germanies.

The Deputy Prime Minister pointed out, "The national question of the German people is to overcome the contradiction between the peaceful interests of our people and the aggressive imperialist plans of certain ruling groups in West Germany. To solve this problem, it is necessary to implement a policy of easing tensions and reconciliation, reaching understanding between the two Germanies, and participating in the drafting of a peace treaty." The German Democratic Republic is in favor of "concluding a peace treaty with the two Germanies, because this will eliminate the problems left over from World War II and establish a normal situation in West Berlin." He emphasized that the upcoming summit meeting must discuss the issues of concluding a peace treaty and normalizing West Berlin.

Speaking about their visit to Burma, Heinrich Rau said that they exchanged views with Burmese Deputy Prime Minister U Lun Baw and other senior Burmese government officials and gained a great deal. "We are pleased to say that in these talks, we agreed on the attitude towards the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which constitute the basis of our two countries' relations."

The German leader then said that his government is prepared to increase the purchase of Burmese rice to 50,000 tons this year if trade between the two countries grows accordingly. He said that negotiations on the purchase of 20,000 tons of Burmese rice have already begun; negotiations on the purchase of timber and oil cake are also nearing completion.

The Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic said that, for the benefit of the peoples of the German Democratic Republic and Burma, in addition to strengthening economic relations between the two countries, cultural and political relations will also be strengthened.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, February 3rd – Today, the "People's Tribune" pointed out in a commentary entitled "China and Burma" that the Sino-Burmese Agreement on the boundary question and the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression, signed in Beijing on January 28, have great international significance.

The commentary said that the Sino-Burmese Agreement on the boundary question eliminates the potential roots of disputes between the two countries, which the enemies of Burmese-Chinese friendship and Asian peace had once hoped would occur. A few days ago, articles speculating on Burmese-Chinese border disputes could still be found in the Western press. The commentary went on to point out, however, that these hopes have been dashed. Premier Zhou Enlai said with satisfaction in his speech at Prime Minister Ne Win's farewell banquet: "With our joint efforts, the Sino-Burmese border will surely become a border of peace and friendship."

The commentary pointed out that Article 3 of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression is of particular significance. This article completely thwarted those who desperately hoped to pull Burma from its neutral policy into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

The commentary said that the rich results of Prime Minister Ne Win's visit to Beijing will not only strengthen Sino-Burmese friendship, but will also have a positive impact on the coordination of relations between Asian countries. This is a step on the road to strengthening the friendship between the entire socialist camp and Southeast Asian countries. This friendship will be one of the main pillars of lasting peace in Asia.

    海因里希·劳在仰光发表谈话
    中缅条约符合和平共处原则
    波“人民论坛报”认为中缅条约有伟大的国际意义
    据新华社仰光2日电　正在这里访问的德意志民主共和国副总理兼对外和东西德贸易部长、德意志民主共和国政府代表团团长海因里希·劳说，中缅友好和互不侵犯条约以及边界问题协定，“是完全符合和平共处五项原则的，因此得到了所有爱好和平的人民的欢迎。”海因里希·劳副总理说，他代表德意志民主共和国政府祝贺中国总理周恩来和缅甸总理奈温将军签订这个条约和协定。
    海因里希·劳今天下午在这里举行的一次记者招待会上还表示，希望两个德国之间能够达成一项解决德国问题的协议。
    这位副总理指出，“德国人民的民族问题是要克服我们人民的和平利益同西德某些统治集团的侵略性的帝国主义计划之间的矛盾。要解决这个问题，就得执行缓和紧张局势和和解的政策，两个德国达成谅解以及通过参加拟订和约的工作。”德意志民主共和国赞成“同两个德国缔结和约，因为这将消除第二次世界大战所遗留下来的问题，和在西柏林建立正常的形势。”他强调说，在即将举行的最高级会议上必须讨论缔结和约和使西柏林正常化的问题。
    海因里希·劳在谈到他们对缅甸的访问时说，他们同缅甸副总理吴伦博以及缅甸政府的其他高级官员交换了意见并得到了很大收获。“我们能够高兴地说，在这些会谈中，我们对构成我们两国关系的基础的和平共处五项原则的态度是一致的。”
    这位德国领导人接着说，如果两国贸易有相应的增长的话，他的政府今年准备把购买缅甸大米的数量增加到五万吨。他说，关于购买两万吨缅甸大米的谈判已经开始了；购买木材和油饼的谈判也即将结束。
    德意志民主共和国副总理说，为了德意志民主共和国和缅甸两国人民的利益，除了加强两国的经济关系之外，两国的文化和政治关系也将加强。
    新华社华沙3日电　今天“人民论坛报”在一篇题为“中国和缅甸”的评论中指出，1月28日在北京签订的中缅关于两国边界问题的协定和中缅友好和互不侵犯条约，具有伟大的国际意义。
    评论说，中缅关于两国边界问题的协定，消除了两国间可能引起争端的潜在的根源，这种争端是缅中友好和亚洲和平的敌人所曾经指望发生的。几天以前，在西方的报刊上，还可以找到关于妄测缅中边界争端的文章。评论接着指出，但是，这些指望都落空了。周恩来总理在奈温总理告别宴会上的讲话中曾满意地指出：“在我们双方共同努力之下，中缅边界一定能够成为和平和友好的边界。”
    评论指出，中缅友好和互不侵犯条约第三条具有特别的意义。这一条使得竭力希望把缅甸从中立的政策拉进东南亚条约组织中去的人们彻底地失败了。
    评论说，奈温总理在北京访问的丰富的成果，不仅将加强中缅的友谊，而且也将对亚洲各国之间的关系的协调产生积极的影响。这是通向加强整个社会主义阵营和东南亚国家之间的友谊的道路上的一个步骤。这一友谊将是亚洲持久和平的主要柱石之一。
