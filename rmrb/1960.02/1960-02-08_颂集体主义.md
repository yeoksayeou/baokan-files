　　　Ode to Collectivism

　　After reading the letter from the First Automobile Works to various transportation departments and automobile manufacturers, and the letter from Soviet friends, my excited mood lingered for a long time. The First Automobile Works, in order to gather ideas and solicit opinions on improving products, widely sought opinions. Soviet friends suggested improving the style of the rubber shoe soles to make them more applicable. All of this is filled with the spirit of collectivism of our socialist country.

　　The socialist cause is a collective undertaking, and the socialist edifice can only be built by the joint efforts of all the people. The work of any one person or one department is only one link in the entire chain of the socialist cause. The wisdom of individuals and departments is limited, while the wisdom of the masses is infinite. Therefore, any improvement in work, from the leadership's point of view, must always rely on the collective strength to complete. From the perspective of each individual, it is necessary to cultivate the habit of caring about the collective cause and frequently put forward suggestions for improvement, so that the common collective cause can be done more, faster, better, and more economically.

　　The Liberation brand automobile and the Double Ball brand sneakers are originally products of good quality, which is generally recognized. But we are believers in continuous revolution and never satisfied with existing achievements. Therefore, continuously improving work and continuously improving products are our regular tasks. We are willing to frequently publish letters of concern for the cause of national construction, whether it is suggestions for improving work or criticism of a certain task, we welcome them all.

### 颂集体主义

    颂集体主义
    读了第一汽车厂给各地交通部门、汽车制造者的信和苏联朋友的来信，兴奋的心情久久不能平静。第一汽车厂为了集思广益，广泛征求改进产品的意见，苏联朋友建议改进球鞋鞋底式样，使之更加适用。这都洋溢着我们社会主义国家的集体主义精神。
    社会主义事业是集体的事业，社会主义大厦是要全体人民群策群力共同奋斗才能筑成。任何一个人、一个部门的工作，只不过是社会主义事业整个锁链中的一个环节。个人的和部门的智慧是有限的，而群众的智慧则是无穷的。因此，任何工作的改进，从领导方面说，总是要依靠集体力量来完成。从每个人来说，那就要养成关心集体事业的习惯，经常提出改进的意见，使共同的集体事业做得更加多快好省。
    解放牌汽车和双球牌球鞋，本来都是质量不错的产品，这是大家公认的。但我们是不断革命论者，永不满足于现有的成就，所以不断改进工作、不断改进产品，是我们的经常任务。我们愿意经常发表关心国家建设事业的来信，无论是改进工作的建议，或者是对某项工作的批评，我们都很欢迎。
