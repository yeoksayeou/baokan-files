Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, February 5th: The Xingdong (Soviet side calls it "Alliance") shoal in the middle reaches of the Heilongjiang River, jointly dredged by Chinese and Soviet waterway workers, has been named "Heilongjiang Friendship Waterway."

The "Heilongjiang Friendship Waterway" is located in the middle reaches of the Heilongjiang River, in the section between Hailanpao (Blagoveshchensk) and Boli (Khabarovsk) in the Soviet Union, and between Heihe and Sanjiangkou in China. One section is a shoal with a rocky riverbed, which had to be closed for several days during dry years, and even when navigable, ships could not be fully loaded. In order to improve navigation conditions on the Heilongjiang River, Chinese and Soviet waterway workers began to jointly dredge this shoal in the winter dredging seasons of 1955 and 1956. In the past few years, they have removed tens of thousands of cubic meters of rock, which has begun to improve navigation conditions.

This project mainly utilizes the natural conditions of freezing rivers in the north, and seasonal dredging is carried out during the winter repair period of ships. Every time the Heilongjiang River freezes, the Chinese side sends more than 100 workers and engineering technicians, and the Soviet side sends dozens of skilled workers and engineering technicians, to the shoal for dredging. The waterway workers from both sides cooperated closely and were full of friendship during the dredging project. In the second dredging year of the winter of 1956 and 1957, both sides further combined the two originally separate construction sites into one. Chinese waterway workers learned a lot of experience in dredging shoals from Soviet waterway workers during the dredging project.

### 中苏合作共同整治浅滩  黑龙江中游出现友谊水道

    中苏合作共同整治浅滩
    黑龙江中游出现友谊水道
    新华社哈尔滨5日电　中苏两国航道工人共同整治的黑龙江中游兴东（苏联称联盟）浅滩，已被命名为“黑龙江友谊水道”。
    “黑龙江友谊水道”位于黑龙江中游，在苏联海兰泡到伯力和我国黑河到三江口的中段，有一段是石质河床的浅滩，每逢枯水年不得不停航数日，即使通航也不能满载。为了改善黑龙江的航行条件，中苏两国航道工人在1955至1956年冬这个整治年，开始共同来整治这一段浅滩。在过去几年中，他们已清除了几万立方米岩石，使航行条件开始有所改善。
    这项工程，主要利用北方河川结冻的自然条件，趁船舶冬修期进行季节性的整治。每当黑龙江封冻后，中国方面就派一百多名工人和工程技术人员，苏联方面派几十名技术工人和工程技术人员，到浅滩进行整治。双方航道工人在整治工程中紧密合作，充满了友谊；在1956至1957年冬的第二个整治年，双方更进一步将原来分开的两个工地合为一个工地。中国航道工作者在整治工程中，向苏联航道工作者学到了许多整治浅滩的经验。
