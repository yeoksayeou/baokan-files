Having the Lofty Ambition of Turning Poverty into Wealth, Taking the Broad Road from Native to Foreign
Shenyang Dadong District Steel Ball Bearing Factory Starts from Scratch, Innovating Technology at High Speed
This factory was formed a little over a year ago by merging seven production groups during the street-level industrial surge. At that time, it only had two broken lathes, and the production process was almost entirely manual. Eighty percent of the factory's more than five hundred people were originally housewives. Now, they have independently manufactured more than one hundred machines, and most operations have been mechanized or semi-mechanized, making it a factory with an annual output of 150,000 sets of steel ball bearings and 10 million steel balls.
    
    This newspaper reports that the Shenyang Dadong District Steel Ball Bearing Factory, starting from scratch without asking the state for a single penny, independently manufactured more than one hundred machines in a little over a year, transforming from almost entirely manual operations to 79% mechanized and semi-mechanized operations. This is a red banner of self-reliance, daring to think and act, boldly creating, and innovating technology at high speed.
    
    This factory was formed a little over a year ago during the street-level industrial surge, by merging seven production groups that spun hemp rope, pasted paper boxes, and repaired carts. At that time, there were only two "decrepit" broken lathes; all the funds were not enough to buy a few machines, and even if machines were bought, there would be no money to buy raw materials; there were also no technicians, and 80% of the factory's more than 500 people were originally housewives. When they decided to produce steel ball bearings based on the urgent needs of the countryside, some people said sarcastically: "If a group of women without any iron can produce steel ball bearings, I will swallow them!" The Party organization taught the workers the principles of daring to think and act, and self-reliance. They used vivid examples of the "ants gnawing at bones" and "teapot boiling pig's head" experiences created by workers from other factories, and stories of Wu Yunduo running an arsenal to educate the workers, actively supporting the bold and daring workers. After extensive debate, all the workers in the factory established the lofty ambition of self-reliance and "turning poverty into wealth." After repeated trials, they finally manufactured steel ball bearings using blacksmith's furnaces, hammers, and grinding wheels. Subsequently, they vigorously carried out technological innovation, independently manufacturing machines. Now, this factory has become a factory with 176 machines, producing 150,000 sets of steel ball bearings and 10 million steel balls annually. The eight specifications of bearings and dozens of sizes of steel balls it produces sell well in twenty-two provinces and cities, strongly supporting industrial and agricultural production in various regions. In 1959, this factory also extracted 110 people to support other factories; in a little over a year, they turned over 2.08 million yuan in profits to the state.
    
    The factory's technological innovation movement was launched as follows:
    
    After they began to produce steel balls and bearings, they accepted the task of producing 520,000 steel balls per month. To complete such a significant task, relying solely on manual labor was not enough; machines were needed. However, where would the machines come from? Some advocated: asking the higher-ups for them; more people advocated: making them themselves. The Party branch mobilized the workers to debate, criticized the ideas of reaching out, relying on, and waiting for foreign machines, and loudly put forward the slogan of "working hard and diligently, being self-reliant, being simple and crude, vigorously building indigenous equipment, and arming ourselves."
    
    They purchased scrap iron and manufactured semi-iron and semi-wood lathes, grinding machines, and other equipment themselves. During the manufacturing process, if there was no heat treatment heating furnace, they used indigenous blacksmith's furnaces instead; if there was no grinding machine, they used wooden frames to support grinding wheels for grinding... The workers actively contributed ideas and suggestions for manufacturing indigenous machinery, and their intelligence and talents were fully displayed. Old worker Liang Guitian and young worker Zhang Guangwen designed four simple machines from forging to grinding. The work done by just one expanding machine in a day was equivalent to six people swinging sledgehammers for twenty days. Apprentice Guo Fengsheng also created an indigenous blanking machine.
    
    After a year and five months of hard work, all the workers in the factory finally manufactured 144 indigenous machines of seventeen types.
    
    Machines replaced manual operations, adapting to the development of production. The next pressing problem was the weakness of technical strength. At that time, none of the young people working on dozens of lathes in the bearing workshop knew how to sharpen knives. They had to line up and wait for experienced masters to help sharpen them; none of the four board hammers in the steel ball workshop could be used by a blacksmith. Workers described this situation as: "Having a thoroughbred horse, but lacking a rider." Therefore, the potential of the equipment could not be fully exploited. The Party branch called on young people to study diligently and practice hard, to be skilled in operating machines, to learn by doing, and to improve their skills through learning. The Youth League branch, according to the Party's instructions, held Red and Expert technical training classes, inviting experienced masters to give lectures or practical guidance to young people, and organized "chain transfer of technology" activities throughout the factory. Masters taught apprentices, senior apprentices taught junior apprentices, early arrivals taught late arrivals, skilled workers taught novices, and fast workers taught slow workers. At the same time, "seven knowledges" (machine tool structure, use, performance and component names, operating procedures, maintenance procedures, etc.) activities were carried out among the young people. A wave of everyone diligently studying and everyone diligently learning, quickly getting started and mastering new technologies was formed throughout the factory. Young female worker Jiang Huidi had never attended school, but because she asked when she didn't know, and humbly asked experienced masters for advice, she not only mastered various technologies such as turning, planing, fitting, and grinding in a few months, but also could do the work of a fifth-grade worker in a single process. She and the group she led entered 1960 eighty-eight days ahead of schedule. All 107 apprentices in the factory reached the level of second-grade technicians, and 42 young people had mastered two to five technologies, basically meeting the needs of production.
    
    The workers' ideological consciousness has also been greatly improved. They love the factory as they love their homes, and live rich days as if they were poor days. When there was no gauze for wiping the machine tools, they collected waste gauze, washed it, and reused it. The factory did not have a sand casting workshop, and contracting it out would cost a lot of money, so the workers and management cadres built it themselves. When installing machine tools and making concrete foundations, if there was no sand or gravel, the workers went out to pick it up themselves in baskets. Here, everyone loves the factory, everyone works with peace of mind, and there is no sound of complaining about treatment or "picking and choosing."
    
    After the factory had a certain number of indigenous machines, they decided to go to the next level, climb higher peaks, and equip the factory with advanced technology. The Communist Youth League organization of this factory, under the leadership of the Party organization, mobilized the youth, summarized the experience of creating and using indigenous equipment, and put forward many rationalization proposals, quickly forming a factory-wide movement of large-scale evaluation, summary, and appraisal of machine equipment. Sixty-five indigenous machines with low efficiency and few uses were eliminated one after another, promoting the development of indigenous machines from rough to fine, from indigenous to foreign. The equipment that had been finalized was matched on each process. For example, when making bearings, after processing with their own indigenous lathes, they still had to be manually ground, which was inefficient, and could not keep up with assembly, and semi-finished products could not be shipped. Young worker Zhang Guangwen and old worker Liang Guitian created a centerless grinder in the grinding process, which could automatically and continuously grind bearings in batches, replacing manual operation, improving efficiency by twenty times, and also making the quality more precise.
    
    Recently, under the call of the Party branch to "establish great ambitions, boost morale, make up our minds, and climb to the peak," all the workers in the factory, with high fighting spirit, are moving towards single-machine automation and semi-automation. Young fitter Zhang Guangwen led several apprentices to overcome many difficulties. After a month of hard work, they assembled the first semi-automatic lathe. This lathe can combine the two processes of bearing processing into one. Then, they assembled four more semi-automatic lathes. Now, all the workers in the factory are studying how to develop the processing of other parts from mechanization to semi-automation and automation, so that the factory's production can climb to new heights.

    有由穷变富的雄心壮志　走由土到洋的康庄大道
    沈阳大东区钢珠轴承厂白手起家高速度革新技术
    这个厂是在一年多前街道大办工业时，由七个生产组合并建成的。当时只有两台破床子，生产过程几乎全部是手工操作。全厂五百多人中百分之八十原来是家庭妇女。现在，他们已自力更生制造了一百多台机器，大部分操作实现了机械化、半机械化，成为一个年产十五万套钢珠轴承和一千万粒钢珠的工厂。
    本报讯　沈阳市大东区钢珠轴承厂白手起家，没有向国家要一文钱，在一年多的时间内自己制造了一百多台机器，由几乎全部手工操作转变为79％的机械化、半机械化操作。这是一面自力更生、敢想敢干、大胆创造、高速度革新技术的红旗。
    这个厂是在一年多以前街道大办工业时，由纺麻绳、糊纸盒、修大车等七个生产组合并成的。当时，只有两台“老掉牙”的破床子；全部资金也不够买几台机器，而且买了机器，就没有钱买原料；技术人员也没有，全厂五百多人中80％原来是家庭妇女。当他们根据农村的迫切需要，决定生产钢珠轴承的时候，就曾有人说讽刺话：“手无寸铁的一伙妇女，要能生产出钢珠轴承来，我就把它吞了！”党组织对职工讲敢想敢干、自力更生等道理，用外厂工人创造“蚂蚁啃骨头”、“茶壶煮猪头”等经验的生动事例和吴运铎办兵工厂等故事，向职工进行教育，积极支持大胆敢干的工人。经过大争大辩，全厂职工树立了自力更生“由穷变富”的雄心大志。他们经过反复试制，终于用铁匠炉、锤子、砂轮等制造出了钢珠轴承。接着，他们又大搞技术革新，自力更生造机器。现在，这个厂已经变成一座拥有一百七十六台机器，年产十五万套钢珠轴承和一千万粒钢珠的工厂。它生产的八种规格的轴承和大大小小数十种钢珠，畅销二十二个省市，有力地支援了各地工农业生产。1959年，这个厂还抽出一百一十人支援了外厂；一年多，他们就向国家上缴了二百零八万元的利润。
    这个厂技术革新运动是这样开展起来的：
    当他们开始制出钢珠、轴承以后，就接受了一个月生产五十二万粒钢珠的任务。要完成这样重大的任务，仅靠手工不行，需要有机器。但是，机器从哪里来？有人主张：向上要；更多的人主张：自己造。党支部发动职工辩论，批判了伸手、依赖和等待洋机器的思想，响亮地提出了“穷干苦干，自力更生，因陋就简，大造土设备，自己武装自己”的口号。
    他们收购废铁，自己制造了半铁半木的车床、研磨机等设备。制造过程中，没有热处理加热炉，就用打铁的土炉子代替；没有磨床，就用木架子支起砂轮来磨……。职工们积极为制造土机械献计献策，聪明才智奔放洋溢。老工人梁贵田和青工张广文，设计了从锻造到研磨的四种简易机械。仅一台扩孔机一天干的活，就顶得上六个人抡大锤干二十天。徒工郭凤生也创造出了土下料机。
    全厂职工经过一年零五个月的艰苦奋斗，终于制造出了十七种一百四十四台土机械。
    机器代替了手工操作，适应了生产的发展。紧接着的问题是技术力量薄弱。当时，轴承车间在几十台车床上干活的青年，没有一个人会磨刀。他们要排队等老师傅帮助磨；钢珠车间四台夹板锤没有一个锻工会使用。工人形容这种状况是：“有了千里马，又缺骑马人”。因此，设备潜力不能充分发挥出来。党支部号召青年勤学苦练，要做操纵机器的能手，在干中学，从学中提高技术。团支部根据党的指示，举办了红专技术训练班，聘请老师傅给青年们讲课或实际辅导，并在全厂组织了“连环传授技术”的活动。师傅带徒弟，大徒弟带小徒弟，早来的带晚来的，熟手带生手，快手带慢手。同时，在青年中开展了“七知道”（机床构造、用途、性能和部件名称、操作规程、保养程序等）活动。全厂形成了人人刻苦钻研、个个勤奋学习，快速上马掌握新技术的热潮。青年女工蒋惠弟没念过一天书，由于她不会就问，虚心向老师傅请教，在几个月内不仅掌握了车、刨、钳、磨等多种技术，而且在单一工序上能够作五级工人的活。她和她领导的小组提前八十八天跨入1960年。全厂一百零七名徒工都达到了二级技工的水平，有四十二名青年已经掌握了二至五种技术，基本上满足了生产的需要。
    工人们的思想觉悟也大大提高。他们爱厂如家，把富日子当穷日子过。擦洗机床没有纱布，就把废旧纱布收回来洗了再用。工厂没有翻砂厂房，包出去修建要花很多钱，工人们就和管理干部一起自修自建。安装机床、打混凝土地基没有砂石，工人们就提着篮子自己出去拣。在这里，人人热爱工厂、个个安心工作，听不到闹待遇和“挑肥拣瘦”的声音。
    工厂有了一定数量的土机械，他们就决心更上一层楼，攀登更高峰，把工厂用先进的技术装备起来。这个厂的共青团组织在党组织的领导下，发动青年，总结了创造和使用土设备的经验，提出了不少合理化建议，很快形成了全厂性的对机器设备的大评比、大总结、大鉴定的运动。先后淘汰了六十五台效率低、用途少的土机器，促进了土机器由粗到精、由土到洋地向前发展。已经定型的设备，在各工序上进行了配套。如在制作轴承时，用他们自己的土车床加工后，还要用手工研磨，效率低，供不上装配成套，半成品积压不能出厂。青年工人张广文和老工人梁贵田就在研磨工序上创制了无心磨，能够自动连续不断地成批研磨轴承，代替了手工操作，提高效率二十倍，质量也更精密了。
    最近，全厂职工在党支部“立大志，鼓干劲，下决心，攀高峰”的号召下，斗志昂扬地向单机自动化、半自动化方向前进。青年钳工张广文带领几个徒工克服了许多困难，经过一个月的奋战，装配出了第一台半自动化车床。这部车床能把轴承加工的两道工序合并为一道。接着，他们又装出了四台半自动化车床。现在全厂职工正研究使其他部件的加工也都由机械化发展到半自动化、自动化，使全厂生产攀上新的高峰。
