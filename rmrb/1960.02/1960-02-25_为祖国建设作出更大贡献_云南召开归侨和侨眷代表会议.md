Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, February 24th: Yunnan Province convened a conference of representatives of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese from February 15th to 22nd. The conference called on returned overseas Chinese and their relatives throughout the province, under the leadership of the Party, to hold high the glorious red banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland, and make greater contributions to this year's continued leap forward. At the same time, they should actively assist the government in receiving and settling returned overseas Chinese.

In their speeches, the representatives warmly thanked the Party and the state for protecting the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese, and believed that the powerful socialist motherland is a strong backing for overseas Chinese. The representatives expressed their indignation at the anti-China and anti-Chinese activities launched by certain powerful groups in Indonesia, resolutely supported the three proposals made by Foreign Minister Chen Yi on behalf of the Chinese government to the Indonesian government on the comprehensive settlement of the overseas Chinese issue, and resolutely supported the State Council's instructions on receiving and settling returned overseas Chinese, believing that these proposals and instructions reflected the Party and the government's concern for overseas Chinese.

Many representatives introduced the tremendous achievements they had personally made in various construction undertakings, which enabled the representatives attending the meeting to further recognize the incomparable superiority of the socialist system and the incomparable power of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. In the speeches of the representatives, it can also be seen that in the vigorous Great Leap Forward, the socialist consciousness of returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students in Yunnan Province has also been greatly improved. A large number of advanced figures have emerged. Last year, 139 returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students throughout the province won the honorary titles of advanced producers, advanced workers, or outstanding students in their respective units, some of whom were awarded by the Yunnan Provincial People's Committee, and some even gloriously attended the National Congress of Heroes. The representatives stated that in this year's continued leap forward, they will strive for more people to become advanced producers and pace-setters, and make greater contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland.

The conference unanimously adopted a congratulatory telegram to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. It adopted resolutions on supporting the Chinese government's proposals for a comprehensive settlement of the Indonesian overseas Chinese issue and implementing the State Council's instructions on receiving and settling returned overseas Chinese, as well as a proposal on launching a socialist labor competition.

Finally, the conference elected the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, with Wang Zhaoming as Chairman, Liang Jinshan, Zhang Xiangshi, and Li Jiaming as Vice-Chairmen, and Huang Buyun and 44 others as members. Five places for members were reserved, to be filled by supplementary elections from newly returned overseas Chinese in the future.
