Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 15th: The rural areas of Shanghai's suburbs have begun sowing spring vegetables. In the past ten days, the entire suburban area has been planting more than 3,000 mu of spring leafy vegetables every day. The first batch of spring mushrooms and early spring eggplants and beans have been planted in mushroom houses and greenhouses. Seedlings of solanaceous vegetables for large-scale sowing have also begun their second transplanting before final planting.

More than a month ago, the rural areas of Shanghai's suburbs began busily preparing for spring vegetable sowing. Counties and people's communes organized forces to accumulate fertilizer for spring vegetables, collect materials for building vegetable trellises, exchange seeds, and hold short-term training classes to impart planting techniques. Many counties and people's communes also held meetings at all levels in the previous period, with the participation of experienced farmers and technicians, to summarize the experience of high-yield spring vegetable fields last year. The planting of solanaceous vegetables used to be shallow plowing and less base fertilizer. After research and summary, it was decided that the solanaceous vegetable fields for spring sowing this year should be deeply plowed to a depth of eight inches to one foot, and sufficient base fertilizer should be applied to increase the yield per unit area.

When arranging this year's spring vegetable sowing, the suburban rural areas paid special attention to improving the quality of vegetables so as to supply fresh and tender vegetables to the city in a timely manner. Tomatoes, eggplants, peppers, etc., are usually on the market in June. This year, the communes have adopted new technical measures to cultivate seedlings half a month to twenty days earlier. The seedlings will be transplanted twice instead of once, and will be on the market in May this year.

In the previous period, the suburban communes added a large number of greenhouses and mushroom houses. The area of greenhouses for spring sowing this year has been expanded from 3,000 rooms in the same period last year to 7,000 rooms, and the mushroom houses have also been expanded from 700,000 square feet to 3 million square feet.

Xinhua News Agency, February 17th: People's communes in the suburbs of Beijing are stepping up the management of overwintering vegetables and comprehensively arranging the sowing of early spring vegetables, striving for a double leap forward in vegetable output and quality this year.

This year, the vegetable planting area in the suburbs of Beijing will be expanded by 40% compared with last year. In the production arrangement, special attention has been paid to improving quality, increasing varieties, and gradually solving the problem of unbalanced supply. At present, the people's communes in the suburbs of the city are organizing and replenishing vegetable production professional teams, and taking active measures in all aspects to ensure that winter and spring vegetables are well managed.

Giving full play to the role of the vegetable production bases that have been initially formed is an important measure taken by the suburban people's communes this year to develop vegetable production. The vegetable production bases in the near suburbs, which have a considerable scale, will continue to expand the planting area of ​​fine vegetables this year, focusing on improving product quality. Counties in the outer suburbs are actively establishing new vegetable production bases in people's communes with experience in growing vegetables and easy transportation. People's communes near large reservoir construction sites, new factories, and mines with large populations will also appropriately increase the area of ​​vegetable fields.

The communes have also paid special attention to the balanced supply of vegetables this year. In the past, the cold weather in spring in March and April and the heavy rain in autumn in August and September were the off-season for vegetable production in Beijing. The supply of vegetables in the market has also decreased as a result. This year, the communes have prepared more than 100,000 sunny plots and 13,000 greenhouses last winter to increase spring vegetable production; the sowing area of ​​early spring and summer vegetables will also be increased. In addition, a production base for adjusting seasonal supply has been established in Yanqing County, north of the Great Wall.

The variety of vegetables will also be increased this year. In the past, some fine vegetables with a small planting area have been appropriately expanded this year; some varieties with promotional value have been included in the plan for unified arrangements. Agricultural science departments and people's communes in various counties (districts) have strengthened the introduction of new varieties and established experimental farms (teams) to cultivate fine varieties. The Vegetable Research Institute has introduced and successfully trialed some fresh, high-quality, cold-resistant and flood-resistant varieties from home and abroad, which will also be universally trialed in various communes this year. The relevant departments have also held vegetable variety meetings, and the communes have exchanged 57 kinds of excellent varieties. The planting area of ​​the "four spicy" vegetables—scallions, ginger, garlic, and peppers—, which used to be mostly supplied from other places, will be increased by nearly three times compared with last year.

At present, the vegetable area has entered a busy season, and most of the communes in the suburbs have implemented the plan to the production team and launched a mass movement to increase vegetable production. The city's 24,000 mu of overwintering vegetables will soon begin to be fertilized and watered, and more than 20,000 mu of early spring vegetables will also be sown successively.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, February 17th: The planned planting area of ​​spring vegetables in the suburbs of Harbin this year is 2.1 times more than last year. At present, the members of the suburban communes of the city are strengthening the field management of overwintering vegetables on the one hand, and actively preparing for the sowing of spring vegetables on the other hand.

The suburban people's communes of this city planted 46,000 mu of overwintering vegetables last winter. Now, the seedlings of these vegetables have generally grown to one inch high. Due to less snowfall since last winter, the members have recently top-dressed manure water in each mu of vegetable land.

The preparations for the communes to sow spring vegetables are also in full swing. The members have applied 10,000 jin of base fertilizer to each mu of spring vegetable land. At the same time, the spring vegetable land was irrigated with newly built machine wells. Early-sown vegetable seedlings such as rapeseed have been cultivated in hotbeds. The members are also stepping up the erection of windbreaks on the spring vegetable land and stepping up the weaving of cold-proof curtains. Many communes plan to apply a layer of horse manure on the spring vegetable land to increase the ground temperature, so as to plant early spring vegetables such as Chinese cabbage in advance.

    大城市郊区多种春菜
    上海北京哈尔滨安排蔬菜播种争取产量质量齐跃进
    新华社上海15日电　上海市郊农村开始播种春菜。十多天来，全郊区每天种植春季叶菜三千多亩。蘑菇房和温室已种上第一批春蘑菇和早春茄豆。大面积播种用的茄果类蔬菜秧苗，也开始作定植前的第二次移植。
    一个多月前，上海市郊区农村就开始忙碌地为蔬菜春播作准备。各县和人民公社组织力量为春菜积肥，收集搭建蔬菜棚架用的材料，相互调剂种子，举办短期训练班传授种植技术。许多县和人民公社前一时期还层层召开有老农和技术人员参加的会议，总结去年春播菜田高额丰产的经验。茄果类蔬菜的种植原来习惯于浅耕和少施基肥，经过研究总结，今年春播的茄果类蔬菜田决定深耕八寸到一尺，同时施足基肥，以提高单位面积产量。
    在安排今年蔬菜春播的时候，郊区农村特别注意了提高蔬菜质量，以便及时供应城市时新鲜嫩的蔬菜。番茄、茄子、辣椒等，历年要在6月份上市。各公社今年采取了新的技术措施，提前半个月到二十天育苗，秧苗由一次移植改为两次移植，今年将提早在5月份上市。
    郊区各人民公社前一时期增建了大量温室和蘑菇房。今年春播的温室面积已由去年同期的三千间扩大到七千间，蘑菇房也由七十万平方尺扩大到三百万平方尺。
    新华社17日讯　北京郊区各人民公社正在抓紧管理越冬蔬菜和全面安排早春蔬菜的播种工作，力争今年蔬菜产量、质量双跃进。
    今年北京郊区的蔬菜种植面积将比去年扩大40％。在生产安排上特别注意了提高质量、增加品种和逐步解决供应不平衡的问题。目前全市郊区的人民公社正在组织和充实蔬菜生产专业队，从各方面采取积极措施，保证一定要把冬、春蔬菜管好。
    发挥已经初步形成的蔬菜生产基地的作用是郊区人民公社今年采取发展蔬菜生产的一项重要措施。已具有相当规模的近郊区蔬菜生产基地，今年将继续扩大种植细菜的面积，着重提高产品质量。远郊区各县正在一批种菜有经验和便于运输的人民公社，积极建立新的蔬菜生产基地。在人口众多的大型水库工地、新建工厂、矿山附近的人民公社，也将适当增加菜田面积。
    各公社今年还特别注意了均衡供应蔬菜的问题。历年来，春季三、四月天寒，秋季八、九月雨涝，是北京蔬菜生产的淡季。市场的蔬菜供应也因此减少。今年，各公社已经在去年冬天准备了十万多个阳畦、一万三千间温室增加春菜生产；早春和夏播蔬菜播种面积也要有所增加。此外，还在长城以北的延庆县建立了调剂季节供应的生产基地。
    今年蔬菜的花色品种也将有所增加。过去，种植面积很小的一些细菜，今年都适当地扩大了播种面积；一些有推广价值的品种，已列入计划统一作了安排。农业科学部门和各县（区）人民公社加强了新品种的引种工作，建立了试验场（队），培育良种。蔬菜研究所从国内外各地引进试种成功的一部分鲜嫩、质佳，耐寒、耐涝的品种，今年也要在各公社普遍试种，有关部门还召开了蔬菜品种会议，各公社相互交换了五十七种优良品种。过去很大部分要靠外地供应的“四辣”——葱、姜、蒜、辣椒的种植面积将比去年增加将近三倍。
    目前，菜区已进入繁忙季节，郊区大部分人民公社已经把计划落实到生产队，开展了增产蔬菜的群众运动。全市二万四千亩越冬蔬菜即将开始施肥、浇水，两万多亩早春蔬菜也将陆续播种。
    新华社哈尔滨17日电　哈尔滨市郊各人民公社的春菜种植面积，今年计划比去年增加二点一倍。目前，全市郊区的社员，正在一面加强越冬蔬菜的田间管理，一面积极准备播种春菜。
    这个市郊区人民公社，去冬种植了四万六千亩越冬蔬菜，现在，这些蔬菜的菜苗，已经普遍长到一寸高。由于去冬以来下雪较少，最近社员们在每亩菜地里都追施了粪水。
    各人民公社播种春菜的准备工作也正在积极进行。社员们已经给每亩春菜地上了一万斤基肥。同时，用新建的机井给春菜地灌了水。油菜等早种菜苗已在温床里培育。社员们还在春菜地上加紧架设防风障，加紧编织防寒帘子。许多公社计划在春菜地里增施一层提高地温的马粪，以便提前栽种小白菜等春菜。
