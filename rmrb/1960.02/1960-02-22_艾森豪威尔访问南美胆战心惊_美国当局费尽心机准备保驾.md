Xinhua News Agency, February 20th -- Due to fear of anti-American movements by the Latin American people, American authorities are meticulously taking strict precautions on the eve of Eisenhower's visit to South America.

According to an Associated Press Washington dispatch on the 17th, official arrangements dictate that Eisenhower will extensively use helicopters during his visit. These helicopters will enable “him to fly directly from the American embassies in Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Santiago, and Montevideo to the airports of these cities” without needing to travel through the city center by car. The dispatch stated that this arrangement was made because American officials “do not rule out” the “possibility of anti-American demonstrations” during Eisenhower's visit. To this end, two American heavy cruisers have already transported ten helicopters to the Brazilian capital on the 15th. A batch of Marines also arrived at the same time.

In Brazil, the first country Eisenhower is scheduled to visit, American special agents are currently engaged in intense activity. These personnel inspected the routes Eisenhower is to take when visiting the Brazilian capital on the 15th and filmed the entire route. According to a Rio de Janeiro dispatch on the 18th, American special agents even requested to inspect the Brazilian presidential palace in order to arrange "security measures" they deemed necessary. This unreasonable request by American special agents, which disregarded Brazilian national dignity, was rejected by Brazilian Presidential Palace Guard Commander General Nelson de Mello.

    艾森豪威尔访问南美胆战心惊
    美国当局费尽心机准备保驾
    新华社20日讯　由于害怕拉丁美洲人民的反美运动，美国当局在艾森豪威尔访问南美前夕费尽心机地进行严密的戒备。
    据美联社17日华盛顿消息透露，根据官方布置，艾森豪威尔在访问时将大量使用直升飞机，这些直升飞机将使“他从美国驻里约热内卢、布宜诺斯艾利斯、圣地亚哥和蒙得维的亚大使馆里直接飞到这些城市的飞机场去”而毋需乘汽车经过市区。消息说，作出这种安排是因为美国官员“不排除”艾森豪威尔访问期间“发生反美示威的可能性”。为了这个目的，两艘美国重巡洋舰已经在15日把十架直升飞机运到巴西首都。同时到达的还有一批海军陆战队。
    在艾森豪威尔预定访问的第一个国家巴西，美国特务人员目前正在紧张地从事活动。这些人员15日巡视了艾森豪威尔访问巴西首都时所要经过的路线，并且把全段路线的情况拍成了电影。据18日里约热内卢消息说，美国特务人员甚至要求检查巴西总统府，以便布置他们认为需要采取的“警卫措施”。美国特务人员这种蔑视巴西国家尊严的无理要求遭到巴西总统府侍卫长纳尔逊·德梅洛将军的拒绝。
