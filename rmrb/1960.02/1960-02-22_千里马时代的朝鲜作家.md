    Korean Writers in the Chollima Era
    Xihong Zhou Yizhi
    In the great Chollima era, what path are Korean writers taking in their lives and creations? The literary and art circles of our country must be very interested in this question.
    Not long ago, when we were on a friendly visit to various parts of North Korea, we paid attention to understanding this issue. We met Korean writers again and again in front of the molten iron-flowing blast furnaces, in the machine-roaring workshops, and in the production teams of agricultural cooperatives. If the hosts hadn't introduced them, we wouldn't have been able to guess who were workers, farmers, and who were writers. Even the writers we knew in the past, we had to take a careful look after the host's introduction before we dared to recognize them. These Korean writers standing at their labor posts were operating machinery so seriously and were so physically strong, which really made us feel happy from the bottom of our hearts.
    Can writers participate in physical labor? Can "laboring on one hand, creating with the other" work? Let's explore the answers to these questions from the life practices and creative practices of Korean writers.
          Writers as Workers
    When we visited the Heechon Machine Tool Factory, we saw the poet Kim Soon-seok covered in oil stains, holding a pair of pliers in his hand, working in the workshop. This young Korean poet has been working in the factory for a year and has not been late or left early for a single day. Now he is a fifth-grade inspector at this factory. Kim Soon-seok told us that before he left Pyongyang, the Central Committee of the Labor Party clearly pointed out to the writers who went to work in the factory that it was not just about changing into a worker's uniform, but most importantly about cultivating the ideological feelings of the working class. Therefore, after going to the factory, he set a rule for himself: first abide by labor discipline, and then talk about writing.
    One thing left a deep impression on him. There was a seventeen-year-old young worker in their workshop named Jung Yong-ryong. Because of his short stature, he was particularly noticeable standing in front of the tall lathe. One day, Kim Soon-seok found that Jung Yong-ryong hadn't come to the night shift, so he asked the work team leader. The team leader pointed behind the lathe and said, isn't that him? It turned out that Jung Yong-ryong had just rushed back to the factory from home, so tired that he couldn't stand up and was sitting on the ground resting. That night, he started work later, but he overfulfilled his task by 100%. After get off work, Kim Soon-seok talked to Jung Yong-ryong and learned that the young worker had taken advantage of the holiday yesterday to visit his mother. Because he missed the bus, he ran eighty miles in one breath, arriving home in the middle of the night. He talked with his mother for a while, and woke up late the next day and missed the bus again, so he had to walk back to the factory. The young worker said it very plainly, feeling that he should come back to work on time. This incident deeply moved Kim Soon-seok. He saw the noble qualities of the working class in Jung Yong-ryong. Kim Soon-seok said: "If it were me, I might not have been able to make it back that day; the workers' discipline is just that strong. There are many such touching things in the factory, which constantly educate me and encourage my enthusiasm and determination to persist in labor training."
    However, it is not so easy to transform from a writer into a worker. When the poet Kim Soon-seok first entered the factory, he was very unaccustomed to the night shift. After finishing the night shift, he couldn't fall asleep during the day. Overcoming this kind of difficulty requires a strong determination and high enthusiasm. Now, he has become accustomed to this kind of intense labor life, and his body is stronger than before. Going to work and getting off work with the workers every day is very pleasant, and at the same time, he writes labor diaries whenever he has time, recording the noble qualities of many worker comrades around him. Kim Soon-seok said that his notebook is full of oil stains, not as clean as before, but the content is much richer. Now his creative enthusiasm is very high, and he writes poetry every morning before starting work. From his own personal experience, he deeply feels that the Party's policy of sending writers to factories and the countryside is very wise.
        Bumper Harvest in Ideology and Creation
    At the Hungnam Fertilizer Factory, we visited Byun Hee-geun, the secretary of the Hamgyongnam-do Writers Union branch. He has been working in the factory for two years and participating in labor for one year. Now he is a fifth-grade mechanical assembler at the fertilizer factory. Three years is not a long time, but these days and nights of labor life have brought important changes to his thoughts and feelings, and also brought gratifying harvests to his literary activities.
    On the first day that Byun Hee-geun stepped onto the production post, he was wearing clean white work clothes, and his white and soft hands made him blush in front of the workers. At that time, he really wanted to wipe his work clothes on the oil drum and insert his hands into the oil drum as well. However, his idea quickly disappeared. Many simple and sincere faces smiled at him; many rough, oil-stained palms warmly shook his hand. He was assigned to the innovation team as a mechanical assembler. With the care and help of worker comrades, he quickly got used to it and became familiar with the work. Now his face and work clothes are also covered with oil stains. One day, after reading the newspaper at noon, a welder said humorously: "Now our writer comrade looks very much like a worker." Byun Hee-geun was very happy when he heard it, and couldn't wait to run over and hug the worker comrade, because the worker comrades already regarded him as one of them. Later, he was responsible for assembling the drying furnace in the innovation team, and he was also one of the shock team members. The machines roared, and piles of fertilizer continued to increase, and he felt very proud. It was this kind of life that made him more deeply realize the communist attitude of worker comrades towards labor, and their various noble qualities. His strong creative desire arose from this burning emotion. In the past three years, he has written eleven short stories, a novella "Youths," and also wrote the movie script "Red Braids." Byun Hee-geun said that the worker comrades cherish the writers very much. They always let the writers do the lighter work and leave the heavy work to themselves. The factory Party committee is also very concerned about the writers, summarizing the writers' work every quarter and arranging writing time for them. In addition to writing their own works, the writers who go to the factory also participate in guiding the activities of the factory's amateur literary and art groups, and are responsible for training some worker authors.
    Korean writers are advancing along such a healthy path. They participate in labor on one hand and engage in creation on the other. Although this path has only been taken for more than a year, it has already achieved good results. Comrade Byun Hee-geun said: The twenty writers in Hamgyongnam-do who have gone to factories and the countryside have all had new works published last year. For example, the poet Kim Cho-gyu, who is a lathe operator at the Ryongsong Machine Factory, wrote the children's literature "Children by the Sea," and recently plans to publish a collection of poems. The writer Chun Se-bong, who works in Kowon County, wrote the novel "Youth of the Stone River." The writer Chae Gyu-cheol works as a fisherman at a aquatic product enterprise and wrote the novel "East Sea"... These new works by writers all praise and depict the new life of the Chollima era, and have made varying degrees of progress and improvement in terms of both ideological and artistic qualities compared to the past. It is particularly worth pointing out that after writers participated in labor, not only did the face of their works change, but also the spiritual outlook of the writers themselves changed. For example, the poet Ham Young-ki, who works as a wind gunner at the Geomdeok Mine, not only labors like the workers, but also puts forward many rationalization proposals. He has been rated as a model worker six times in a year. In the past, his poems were not very good. The long poem "Blasting Worker" he recently published in "Literary News" is much better than his previous poems and has been well received by readers. Now he is one of the most prolific poets in the Republic. This year is the fifteenth anniversary of the liberation of Korea. Recently, the writers of Hamgyongnam-do discussed the writing plan for the anniversary and prepared to write two novels, three novellas, three narrative poems, and one drama. The themes of these works were also obtained by the writers in their labor.
    The living and creative situation of the writers in Hamgyongnam-do is also the general situation of Korean writers. Obviously, Korean writers have already well combined labor life and creative life.
          The Teachings of the Party
    On a snowy day, we paid a friendly visit to the Central Committee of the Korean Writers Union. Comrade Han Seol-ya with graying temples and several other Korean writers were already there waiting for the Chinese guests. Comrade Han Seol-ya is one of the founders of "Korean Proletarian Art League," the earliest progressive literary group in modern Korea. Our people are relatively familiar with his literary activities. Now he is the chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Writers Union. That day, Comrade Han Seol-ya was particularly talkative. He said to us in a heart-to-heart tone: "I accept the Party's entrustment to do the work of the Writers Union, and I can't go down to the grassroots for a long time. However, I really want to be with the workers and peasants. In the spring of 1960, I will also go down to participate in labor for a few months to experience life. This morning, I talked to a female worker who had just been awarded the title of Labor Hero. She talked so vividly that I couldn't think of such a moving thing even if I sat in the office for a hundred years." Then, Comrade Han Seol-ya said with a lot of emotion: "I have had forty years of literary creation activities. During the period when Japanese imperialism occupied our country, it was very difficult for us to get close to the workers and peasants; now this road is open!..."
    Yes, in the past, under the pursuit and persecution of Japanese invaders, the struggle of Korean progressive writers to defend national culture was indeed very arduous. At that time, it was indeed full of difficulties and obstacles for them to approach the workers and peasants. In 1925, although there was such a progressive organization as "Korean Proletarian Art League," the road between writers and workers and peasants could not be opened. Their works were often banned, and they themselves were often thrown into prison. At that time, only in the anti-Japanese armed struggle areas led by Comrade Kim Il-sung did literature and art truly belong to the people. After the "August 15th" liberation in 1945, a broad road to the workers and peasants was opened up for Korean writers.
    The Central Committee of the Labor Party and Comrade Kim Il-sung constantly taught writers: Literature must adhere to the principle of Party spirit and educate the people with socialist ideology. The Party requires all literary workers to arm themselves with the Marxist-Leninist worldview and deeply study life; it also proposes to writers: they must go deep into the workers, peasants and soldiers, be familiar with them, and describe them. In the early days of liberation, many Korean writers went to factories, mines, rural areas, and fishing villages to experience life; during the Fatherland Liberation War, Korean writers joined the army and went to the front lines; in the post-war period, they returned to factories, mines, rural areas and fishing villages for long-term life experiences. Some excellent works have been produced in each period. Since the socialist construction of Korea entered the climax of the Chollima movement, real life has put forward higher requirements for writers. Comrade Han Seol-ya said that before this, Korean writers went to factories and the countryside mostly to do some cultural enlightenment work, approaching the workers and peasants and helping the workers and peasants improve their culture. This is of course of great benefit to both writers and workers and peasants; however, today writers must describe such an unprecedented heroic era and create new characters that are constantly emerging, they must more deeply understand the life struggles and spiritual world of the working people. Therefore, writers must engage in labor in certain production posts like workers and farmers, live and breathe with the workers and peasants, and more deeply experience the thoughts and feelings of the workers and farmers, and turn them into their own flesh and blood. Only in this way can writers better discover and shape new characters. This has created a new situation in which Korean writers go to factories as workers and go to the countryside as farmers; laboring on one hand and creating on the other.
        Resolutely Take This Road
    Comrade Han Seol-ya told us: "In December of the year before last, more than 60 writers from the Korean Writers Union went down and truly became workers and farmers. Everyone felt that they had gained a lot. The poet Baek In-joon works at the Guseong Machine Factory. Recently, reading his poems, I felt that they were much better than before. In the past, he wrote poetry only with talent, but now he has a richer life experience, and what he writes is different. It is dangerous to write poetry only with talent. Some foreign writers believe that since writers are 'engineers of human souls,' they do not need to go deep into the masses, and they can create various characters by sitting in a room. Such people despise physical labor and despise the workers and peasants. This is bourgeois thought. People with this kind of thought cannot discover new people at all, let alone express them."
    Comrade Han Seol-ya continued: "When writers go to factories and the countryside, the Party puts forward the slogan of 'laboring on one hand and creating on the other.' Some writers doubted, thinking that physical labor is very hard, where is there any energy to engage in writing. In fact, it is not like this. Some writers who are physically weaker have become healthier and more energetic than before after participating in appropriate labor. The writer Li Ji-ge is an old writer from the period of Japanese imperialist rule and was in prison with me. Now he is participating in labor at the Unbong Hydropower Station construction site. He is preparing to write a novel. A few days ago, he returned to Pyongyang for something. I suggested to him: 'If you don't have time to write below, you can temporarily leave production.' He said: 'December is almost over, I can't delay production. I plan to write this novel next to the workers and don't want to leave the construction site.'"
    Comrade Li Ji-ge's mood is the mood of all Korean writers. Today, Korean writers are all enthusiastically determined to take this road. This vigorous new situation is bringing unprecedented prosperity to Korean literature. Under the teachings and care of the Labor Party and Comrade Kim Il-sung, Korean writers are writing the most glorious chapter of Korean literature in the Chollima era together with all the working people.

    千里马时代的朝鲜作家
    西虹　周毅之
    在伟大的千里马时代，朝鲜作家是走着怎样一条生活和创作的道路？这个问题，我国的文艺界一定会发生很大的兴趣。
    不久以前，我们在朝鲜各地进行友好访问的时候，曾经注意了解这个问题。我们在铁水奔流的高炉前、在机器轰鸣的车间里和在农业社的生产班里，一次又一次地碰到朝鲜的作家。假如不是主人介绍，我们根本猜不出谁是工人、农民，谁是作家。就是我们过去认识的作家，主人介绍之后，我们也得仔细打量一番才敢认。这些站在劳动岗位上的朝鲜作家，操作机械是那样认真，身体又是那样健壮，看了真叫人从心眼里感到高兴。
    作家参加体力劳动能行吗？“一面劳动，一面创作”能行吗？我们且从朝鲜作家的生活实践和创作实践来探寻这些问题的答案吧。
          作家当工人
    我们在访问熙川工作母机厂的时候，看见诗人金舜石满身油污，手上拿着一把老虎钳，正在车间里工作。这位朝鲜青年诗人下厂劳动已经一年，没有一天迟到或早退。现在他是这个厂的五级检验工。金舜石告诉我们，在他离开平壤之前，劳动党中央就向下厂劳动的作家明确指出，作家下厂劳动不仅仅是要换件工人服，而最重要的是要培养工人阶级的思想情感。因此，下厂以后，他就给自己规定了一条：首先遵守劳动纪律，然后再谈写作。
    有这样一件事，给他留下很深的印象。他们车间有个十七岁的小工人，名叫郑用龙，由于个子矮小，站在高大的车床前面特别引人注意。有一天，金舜石发现郑用龙没有来上夜班，就找作业班长问。班长指着车床后面说，那不是他吗？原来郑用龙刚从家里赶回工厂，累得站不起来，正坐在地上休息。那天晚上，他开始工作比较迟，却超额一倍完成了任务。下班后，金舜石找郑用龙谈话，才知道这位小工友昨天趁着休假，回去看望妈妈，因为没赶上汽车，一口气跑了八十里，到家已经是半夜。他和妈妈谈了一会，第二天起晚了，又误了车，只好再徒步赶回工厂。小工友说得很平淡，觉得自己到时候就应该赶回来上班。这件事深深地感动了金舜石。他从郑用龙身上，看到了工人阶级的高贵品质。金舜石说：“要是我，当天就不一定能赶回来；工人同志的纪律性就是强。工厂里有许多这样感人的事情，不断地教育了我，鼓舞我的干劲和坚持劳动锻炼的决心。”
    但是，由作家变成一个工人，并不是那么容易。诗人金舜石刚进工厂的时候，上夜班就很不习惯。夜班上完了，白天又偏偏睡不着。要克服这种困难，需要有坚强的决心和高度的热情。现在，他已经习惯于过这种紧张的劳动生活，而且身体比以前更结实了。每天跟工人一起上班下班，很愉快，同时一有空就写劳动日记，记载身边许多工人同志的高贵品质。金舜石说，他的笔记本上尽是油污，不像过去那样干净，但内容却比过去丰富多了。现在他的创作热情很高，每天早上都写诗，上班时才放笔。他从自己的亲身体会，深深地感觉到，党要作家下厂、下乡的政策非常英明。
        思想创作两丰收
    在兴南化肥厂，我们访问了咸镜南道作家同盟支部书记边熙根。他已经在厂里工作两年，参加劳动一年。现在他是化肥厂的五级机械装配工。三年的时间不算长，但是这些劳动生活的日日夜夜，却给他的思想感情带来重要的变化，也给他的文学活动带来可喜的收获。
    边熙根开始走上生产岗位的第一天，他身上穿着洁白的工作服，在工人面前露出又白又柔软的手，不由得脸红耳赤，当时真想把工作服在油桶上擦一擦，把两只手也插进油桶里去。但是，他的这种想法很快就消失了。许多淳朴、诚恳的面孔朝着他微笑；许多沾满着油泥的粗大的手掌热烈地握住他的手。他被分配到革新组担任机械装配工。在工人同志的关心和帮助下，他很快就习惯了，熟悉了工作。现在他的脸上和工作服上也粘满了油泥。有一天中午读报以后，一位电焊工很有风趣地说：“现在我们的作家同志也很像个工人了。”边熙根听了很高兴，恨不得跑过去拥抱这位工友，因为工友们已经把他看作是他们中间的一个了。后来，他在革新组负责装配干燥炉，他也是突击队员中的一个。机器轰隆隆地转动着，一堆一堆的肥料不断增加，他感到很自豪。就是这样的生活，使他更深刻地体会到工人同志们对待劳动的共产主义态度，和他们的种种高贵品质。他那强烈的创作欲望，就是从这种燃烧着的感情中产生出来的。三年来，他写了十一个短篇小说，一个中篇小说“青年们”，还写了电影剧本“红色的辫带”。边熙根说，工人同志们都非常爱护作家，他们总是让作家去干比较轻的活，重活留给自己干。工厂党委也很关心作家，每个季度都总结作家的工作，给他们安排写作的时间。下厂作家除了自己写作之外，还参加指导工厂里业余文艺小组的活动，并且负责培养一些工人作者。
    朝鲜作家正是沿着这样一条健康的道路前进的。他们一面参加劳动，一面进行创作。虽然这样的道路才走了一年多，但是已经收到很好的成效。边熙根同志说：咸镜南道的二十个下厂、下乡的作家，去年他们每个人都有新作品问世。比如：在龙城机械厂当车工的诗人金朝奎，写了儿童文学“海边的孩子”，最近还打算出版一本诗集。在高原郡劳动的作家千世峰，写了长篇小说“石河的青春”。作家蔡奎哲在水产事业所当捕鱼工，写了长篇小说“东海”……。这些作家的新作品，都歌颂和描写了千里马时代的新生活，不论在思想性和艺术性方面，都比过去有了不同程度的进步和提高。特别值得指出的是，作家参加劳动之后，不仅作品的面貌起了变化，同时作家本人的精神面貌也起了变化。比如，在检德矿山当风枪手的诗人咸永基，不仅和工人一样劳动，还提了许多合理化建议。他在一年中六次被评为模范工人。从前，他写的诗并不怎样好。最近他在“文学新闻”上发表的长诗“爆破工”，比以前的诗好多了，受到读者的好评。现在他是共和国创作最多的诗人之一。今年是朝鲜解放十五周年，最近咸镜南道的作家讨论了献礼写作计划，准备写长篇小说两部、中篇小说三部、叙事诗三部、话剧一部。这些作品的题材，也都是作家们在劳动中获得的。
    咸镜南道作家们生活和创作的情况，也是朝鲜作家的普遍情况。显然地，朝鲜的作家们已经把劳动生活和创作生活很好地结合起来了。
          党的教导
    在一个大雪纷飞的日子，我们去朝鲜作家同盟中央委员会作友好访问。鬓发斑白的韩雪野同志和另外几位朝鲜作家，早已在那里等候中国客人。韩雪野同志是近代朝鲜最早的进步文学团体“朝鲜无产阶级艺术同盟”的创始人之一。他的文学活动，我国人民是比较熟悉的。现在他是朝鲜作家同盟中央委员会的委员长。那天，韩雪野同志的谈兴特别浓。他用谈心的口气向我们说：“我接受党的委托，搞作家同盟的工作，不能长期下到下面去。可是，我很想跟工人农民在一起。1960年春天，我也要下去参加劳动几个月，体验生活。上午我和一位刚刚获得劳动英雄称号的女工谈话，她谈得真生动，我坐在办公室里想一百年，也想不出那样动人的东西。”接着，韩雪野同志感触颇多地说：“我已经有四十年的文学创作活动，日本帝国主义侵占我国的时期，我们要接近工农群众，困难很多；现在这条路打开了！……”
    是的，过去在日本侵略者的追捕、迫害下，朝鲜进步作家们所进行的保卫民族文化的斗争，的确是十分艰苦。当时他们接近工农群众的确有重重困难和阻碍。1925年，虽然有了
  “朝鲜无产阶级艺术同盟”这样一个进步组织，但是作家与工农群众之间的道路还是不能打开。他们的作品常常被查禁，他们自己常常被投进监牢。那时候，只有在金日成同志所领导的抗日武装斗争地区内，文学艺术才真正属于人民。1945年“八·一五”解放以后，朝鲜作家面前便展开了一条通向工农群众的广阔道路。
    劳动党中央和金日成同志不断地教导作家：文学必须坚持党性原则，以社会主义思想教育人民。党要求全体文学工作者用马克思列宁主义世界观武装自己，深刻地研究生活；还向作家提出：必须深入到工农群众中去，熟悉他们，描写他们。在解放初期，许多朝鲜作家到工厂、矿山、农村、渔村去体验生活；在祖国解放战争时期，朝鲜作家纷纷从军上前线；在战后时期，他们又回到工厂、矿山、农村和渔村长期体验生活。每个时期都产生了一些优秀作品。自从朝鲜的社会主义建设进入千里马运动的高潮以后，现实生活对作家提出了更高的要求。韩雪野同志说，在这以前，朝鲜作家下厂下乡，多半是搞些文化启蒙工作，接近工农群众和帮助工农群众提高文化。这当然对作家和对工农群众都有很大好处；但是，今天作家要描写这样一个空前未有的英雄时代，要塑造不断涌现出来的新人物，就必须更深刻地了解劳动人民的生活斗争和精神世界。因此，作家必须和工人、农民一样，在一定的生产岗位上从事劳动，和工农群众一起生活、呼吸，更深刻地体验工人农民的思想情感，把它变成自己的血和肉。只有这样，作家才能更好地发现和塑造新的人物。这样就开创了朝鲜作家下厂当工人、下乡当农民；一面劳动、一面创作的崭新局面。
        坚决走这条路
    韩雪野同志告诉我们：“前年12月，朝鲜作家同盟有六十多位作家下去，真正当了工人、农民，大家都感到收获很大。诗人白仁俊在龟城机械厂劳动，最近读他的诗，觉得比过去好多了。过去他光凭才能写诗，现在有了更丰富的生活体验，写出来的东西就不一样。光凭才能写诗是危险的。有些外国作家认为，作家既然是‘人类灵魂的工程师’，就不必深入群众，坐在屋子里也能创作出各种人物。这种人轻视体力劳动，轻视工农群众。这是资产阶级思想。有这种思想的人，根本不可能发现新的人，更谈不上表现他们了。”
    韩雪野同志接着说：“作家下厂下乡的时候，党提出‘一面劳动、一面创作’的口号。有些作家怀疑，认为体力劳动很辛苦，哪里还有精力从事写作。实际上并不是这样。有些体质比较弱的作家，参加适当的劳动后，身体比以前健康了，精力也更加旺盛了。作家李甲基是日本帝国主义统治时期的老作家，和我一起蹲过监狱。现在他正在云峰水电站工地参加劳动。他准备写一部长篇小说。前些日子他有事回到平壤，我向他建议：‘如果你在下面没有时间写作，可以暂时脱产。’他说：‘12月快完了，我不能耽误生产。我打算在工人身边写这部长篇小说，不想离开工地。’”
    李甲基同志的心情，正是全体朝鲜作家的心情。今天，朝鲜的作家们都满腔热情地坚决走这条路。这种生气勃勃的新局面，正给朝鲜文学带来从未有过的繁荣。朝鲜作家正在劳动党和金日成同志的教导和关怀下，跟全体劳动人民在一起，书写着朝鲜文学在千里马时代的最光辉的篇章。（附图片）
