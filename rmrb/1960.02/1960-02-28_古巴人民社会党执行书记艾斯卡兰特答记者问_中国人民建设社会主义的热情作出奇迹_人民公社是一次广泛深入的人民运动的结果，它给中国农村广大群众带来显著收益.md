The Chinese People's Enthusiasm for Building Socialism Creates Miracles
The People's Commune is the Result of a Broad and Deep People's Movement, Bringing Significant Benefits to the Vast Masses of the Chinese Countryside

The People's Commune is the result of a broad and deep people's movement. As everyone knows, as soon as the revolution seized power on the Chinese mainland, it launched land reform. Land reform eliminated Chinese feudalism. The first step was to give land to the millions of peasants who had no land to cultivate. After the Chinese peasants had land, a movement called cooperation emerged among the masses, which was to develop the mutual aid strength of the peasants. Because, as everyone knows, individual cultivation yields much less than collective cultivation. This first stage of cooperation, after a short time (a few years), immediately developed into a higher-level movement on this basis: the establishment of what the Chinese call elementary cooperatives. Soon, two years later, it developed into an advanced cooperative movement. This kind of advanced cooperative developed and expanded in China, in various places. As a result, the communization movement emerged among the Chinese people. What is a commune? It can be said that a commune is a higher level of cooperative movement than an advanced cooperative. Why? Because not only is the land turned over by the peasants owned in common, not only is distribution made according to labor, but also a certain amount of production income is distributed according to the needs of the members. This produced the following result: commune members have a portion of the same income (agricultural products or cash), and in addition, there is supplementary income given to members based on labor and production conditions. This is the People's Commune.

The People's Commune is the administrative organ of all local life, which can enable the Chinese countryside to develop rapidly.

The commune is a movement, or rather, an organ representing local life in the Chinese countryside. What does this mean? A commune composed of a certain number of peasant households is the administrative organ of all local life, taking care of rural production, taking care of the various small industrial productions that are beginning to appear in the countryside, leading all local life, leading the government, leading education, leading health, in short, grasping and leading all local life. The commune is a collection of cooperatives, people's congresses, and local governments. The commune unites the social forces of the Chinese countryside, the broad masses, and greatly pushes it forward. In this way, the Chinese countryside can be developed rapidly and bring significant benefits to the vast masses of the Chinese countryside.

Because the communes concentrate a large number of people, unite and cooperate and work together, great water conservancy and irrigation projects are easily completed. When one talks about irrigation projects, one should know that in China, that is, in the so-called Chinese mainland, or eastern China, the irrigation problem needs to be solved urgently. This has always been a special problem, and we can say that this is a problem for the Chinese people for many years. Finding water, being able to have water to irrigate the land for production has always been an important issue in Chinese agriculture. Obviously, to build large reservoirs to store the necessary water, it cannot be achieved by individual efforts alone; it is necessary to unite and develop collective strength. On the basis of collective strength, for example, the efforts of 7,000 households can build a series of important reservoirs like the October People's Commune near Nanjing, which will permanently solve the water problem, which can greatly develop production. Large and small reservoirs are being built every day throughout China. In these great projects, the tremendous collective strength of the masses of this great country is manifested everywhere.

The Great Leap Forward is a manifestation of the Chinese people's intelligence and wisdom, and the Great Leap Forward in economic development is comprehensive and nationwide.

The Great Leap Forward and "walking on two legs" are expressions of the Chinese people's intelligence and wisdom. Regarding the Great Leap Forward, the people call the huge progress of the national economy in 1958 and 1959 by this name; I can give an example: steel production was about five million tons in 1957; it produced eight million tons in 1958. As you can see, the leap forward is very remarkable, and it is a great leap forward in development. This is not only in steel, but also in coal, electricity, transportation, and agriculture; it is comprehensive. Therefore, the slogan of catching up with Britain (a very developed capitalist country) in industrial production in fifteen years may be achieved in a shorter period of time.

The Chinese people's enthusiasm for construction is mass-based, and the Chinese Communist Party directs this enthusiasm towards the direction of the Great Leap Forward.

Now, as soon as this question is raised, a question immediately arises: how is this possible? When the Chinese explain these problems, they say that some foreign news agencies say that this is impossible, that this disrupts the production rhythm and the necessary coordination in production development, because the leap forward creates imbalance. The Chinese say no; because they have utilized the Chinese people's great enthusiasm for building socialism, this enthusiasm enables them to create miracles, for example, using voluntary labor, they built the Ming Tombs Reservoir (another important project) in just a few months, or they made miracles of construction and development. In China, this enthusiasm is mass-based, because it is not working for any private exploiter, but working for oneself. The Chinese Communist Party directs this enthusiasm towards the direction of the Great Leap Forward, that is, leading this enthusiasm to serve the development of the country. In places and regions where conditions exist, people began to make steel and iron, and make steel to help develop production, thus producing a large amount of iron, much more than they thought. This is the economic leap forward. This is the Great Leap Forward policy. The leap forward in 1958 was great, the leap forward in 1959 was also great, and the leap forward will continue in 1960. It took Britain more than a hundred years to reach more than 13 million tons of steel, but China completed what Britain did in more than a hundred years in ten years. That is, from 1949 to 1959.

    古巴人民社会党执行书记艾斯卡兰特答记者问
    中国人民建设社会主义的热情作出奇迹
    人民公社是一次广泛深入的人民运动的结果，它给中国农村广大群众带来显著收益
    人民公社是一次广泛深入的人民运动的结果。大家知道，革命一在中国大陆上掌握政权，就开展了土地改革。土地改革消灭中国封建主义。第一步就是把土地交给没有土地耕种的千百万的广大农民。中国农民有了土地之后，在群众中就出现了人们称之为合作化的运动，就是发展农民的互助力量。因为，大家知道个体耕种比集体耕种收获少得多。这一合作化的第一阶段经过不长时间（没几年），立刻就在这一基础上发展成更高一级运动：建立中国人所说的初级合作社。不久，两年之后，发展到高级合作化运动。这种高级合作社，在中国，在各地发展和扩大。结果，在中国人民当中就出现了公社化运动。什么是公社呢？可以说，公社是比高级合作社更高级的合作化运动。为什么？因为不只农民交出的土地是共有的，不只按劳分配，而且还按社员需要，分配一定的生产收益。这样就产生了下列的结果：公社社员有一部分相同的收益（农产品或现金），另外，还有根据劳动和生产情况给社员的增补收入。这就是人民公社。
    人民公社是全部地方生活的管理机关，它可以使中国农村很快发展起来
    公社是一种运动，更好地说是一种代表中国农村地方生活的机关。这是什么意思呢？由一定数量农户组成的公社，是全部地方生活的管理机关，要照顾农村的生产，照顾农村开始出现的各种小工业生产，领导全部地方生活，领导政府，领导教育，领导卫生，总之，掌握和领导全部地方生活。公社是合作社、人民代表大会、地方政权的集合体。公社联合了中国农村的社会力量，广大的群众，并把它大大地推向前进。这样就可使中国农村很快地发展起来，并给中国农村广大群众带来显著的收益。
    由于各公社集中了大量的人，团结合作共同努力，伟大的水利灌溉工程很容易就完成了。一个人当谈到灌溉工程时，应该知道，在中国，即在所谓中国的本部，或中国的东部，灌溉问题是急需解决的。这一向是一个特殊的问题，我们可以说这是中国人民多年的问题。寻找水，能够有水来灌溉土地进行生产一向是中国农业的重要问题。显然，要建造大水库，积蓄必要的水，只靠个人力量是不能实现的，必须联合和发展集体力量，在集体力量的基础上，例如七千户的努力，就可像南京近郊十月人民公社那样建造一系列重要的水库，永远解决了水的问题，这样就可以大大地发展生产。在中国各地每天都在建造大大小小的水库，在这些伟大的工程中，到处表现出这个伟大国家群众集体的巨大力量。
    大跃进是中国人民聪明和智慧的表现，经济发展中的大跃进是各方面的和全国性的
    大跃进和“两条腿走路”这两句话是中国人民聪明和智慧的表现。关于大跃进，人民这样称呼1958年和1959年国民经济巨大的进步；我可以举个例子：钢1957年约生产五百万吨；1958年生产了八百万吨。正如你们看到的，跃进是非常卓绝的，是发展中很大的跃进。这不只在钢铁方面，也在煤炭、电力、运输、农业方面；是全面的。因此，十五年在工业生产方面赶上英国（很发达的资本主义国家）的口号就可能在更短的时间内实现。
    中国人民的建设热情是群众性的，中国共产党把这种热情引向大跃进的方向
    现在一提出这问题马上就出现一个疑问，这怎么可能呢？中国人在解释这些问题时说，外国通讯社有些人说这是不可能的，这破坏了生产节奏和生产发展中必要的协调，因为跃进产生不平衡。中国人说不是；因为他们利用了中国人民建设社会主义的巨大热情，这种热情使他们作出奇迹，例如，用义务劳动，使他们在短短的几个月内建成十三陵水库（另一个重要的工程），或使他们去建树发展的奇迹。在中国这种热情是群众性的，因为不是给任何一个私人剥削者劳动，而是给自己劳动。中国共产党把这种热情引向大跃进的方向，就是说，领导这种热情，使它为国家的发展服务。在有条件的地方和地区，人们开始炼钢、炼铁，并炼出钢来帮助发展生产，这样就生产了大量的铁，比他们想的要多的多。这就是经济上的跃进。这就是大跃进政策，1958年的跃进很大，1959年的也很大，1960年还将继续跃进。为了达到一千三百多万吨钢，英国用了一百多年，但是，英国一百多年所作的事情中国十年就作完了。即从1949年到1959年。
