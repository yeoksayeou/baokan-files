Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 19th - The American plane incursions have aroused immense anger among the Cuban people. The Cuban Workers' Confederation has issued a statement strongly condemning the incredibly barbaric violation of Cuban national sovereignty by American planes. The statement pointed out that the facts expose the lies of U.S. officials that American territory would not be used as a base for attacking Cuba. The statement said that despite the plane attacks and the various conspiracies played by the U.S. State Department, the Cuban people and the working class's support for the revolutionary government will be increasingly strengthened.

The National Sugar Workers' Union said that 500,000 sugar workers expressed their determination to do a good job in sugarcane production even if the sugar mills are bombed.

The Workers' Confederation of Matanzas Province, which was invaded by American planes, said that every worker is a well-equipped and trained soldier, and they are determined to punish the invaders. Workers at the Spain sugar mill angrily sent a protest telegram to the U.S. Embassy. In Perico, shops closed to show their protest.

In Las Villas Province, almost all organizations, including the "26th of July Movement," the People's Socialist Party, the Revolutionary Directorate, the Las Villas Province Workers' Confederation, as well as staff and student organizations, sent protest telegrams to the U.S. State Department.

Havana newspapers published commentaries and photos of the wreckage of the invading American plane and other evidence of American aggression in special sections. According to newspaper reports, American planes yesterday also dropped incendiary bombs on sugarcane fields in Las Villas and Matanzas provinces, causing fires. "Hoy" pointed out in an editorial that the evidence of American aggression against Cuba is precisely the evidence of the U.S.'s two-faced policy, which has been most powerfully struck down in front of the whole world. It will be difficult for Eisenhower to explain to the Latin American people he intends to visit because the Latin American people see clearly the relationship between disguised friendship and deliberate crime. "Revolución" also accused Herter and other senior American officials of clamoring for economic retaliation against Cuba on the same day that (American planes) carried out aerial invasions.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th - Washington News: In the face of irrefutable evidence, the U.S. State Department yesterday had to admit that the plane that crashed on the 18th while bombing a Cuban sugar mill took off from an American base and formally "apologized" to the Cuban government through the U.S. Ambassador to Cuba.

For more than a month, planes taking off from the United States have continuously and frantically bombed Cuban sugar mills and sugarcane fields. The Cuban government has repeatedly lodged strong protests against this act of armed aggression, but the U.S. State Department has tried its best to deny it on the pretext that there is no factual basis. U.S. President Eisenhower even described Cuban Prime Minister Castro's legitimate protests as "unjustified attacks" at a press conference in Washington on January 26, and threatened that Castro's remarks would "hardly promote" "understanding and appropriate relations" between the two governments, trying to shift the responsibility for the deterioration of Cuban-American relations onto the Cuban government.

In a statement issued on the 19th, U.S. State Department spokesman White admitted that, after "investigation," the plane took off from Tamiami Airport near Miami, but he emphasized that the plane was a "private plane" and the flight was "unauthorized." The statement did not offer any specific guarantees on how to stop such bombing crimes in the future, and said that he "knew nothing about whether the United States would take measures to arrest the accomplices in this attack."

    古巴人民怒斥美国侵略者
    决心加强支持革命政府严惩入侵者
    美国国务院无法抵赖罪行但不愿保证停止轰炸
    新华社哈瓦那19日电　美国飞机的入侵激起了古巴人民无比的愤慨，古巴工人联合会发表声明强烈谴责美国飞机对古巴民族主权的无比野蛮的侵犯。声明指出，事实揭穿了美国官方所谓不会把美国领土用作攻击古巴的基地的谎言。声明说，尽管有飞机的袭击和美国国务院玩弄的形形色色的阴谋，古巴人民和工人阶级对革命政府的支持将日益加强。
    全国糖业工人联合会说，五十万糖业工人表示，即使糖厂遭到轰炸，他们仍将决心搞好蔗糖生产。
    美国飞机入侵的马坦萨斯省的工人联合会说，每一个工人都是一个装备良好、受过训练的士兵，他们决心惩罚入侵者。西班牙糖厂的工人愤怒地向美国大使馆发出了抗议电报。在佩里科，商店停止营业，表示抗议。
    在拉斯维利亚斯省，几乎所有的组织，包括“七月二十六日运动”、人民社会党、革命指导委员会、拉斯维利亚斯省工人联合会以及职员和学生组织都向美国国务院发出了抗议的电报。
    哈瓦那各报都发表评论，并且在专门的版面上登载了入侵的美国飞机残骸和美国侵略的其他证据的照片。据报纸报道，就在昨天美国飞机还向拉斯维利亚斯和马坦萨斯省的甘蔗田投掷了燃烧弹，引起了火灾。“今日报”在社论中指出，美国侵略古巴的证据正是美国两面政策的罪证，它使这种政策在全世界面前已经遭到了最有力的打击。艾森豪威尔将难于向他打算访问的拉丁美洲人民做出解释。因为拉丁美洲各国人民对伪装的友谊和蓄意进行的罪恶之间的关系看得很清楚。“革命报”还指责赫脱和其他美国高级官员在（美国飞机）进行空中侵略的同一天，叫嚣要对古巴进行经济报复。
    新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：在铁证如山的面前，美国国务院昨天不得不承认18日因轰炸古巴糖厂而坠毁的一架飞机是从美国基地上起飞的，并且通过美国驻古巴大使向古巴政府正式“道歉”。
    一个多月以来，从美国起飞的飞机不断地对古巴的糖厂和甘蔗田进行了疯狂的轰炸，古巴政府对这种武装侵略罪行一再提出强硬抗议，但是美国国务院却以没有任何事实根据为借口，多方设法抵赖。美国总统艾森豪威尔在1月26日的华盛顿记者招待会上还把古巴总理卡斯特罗的正当抗议说成是“毫无理由的攻击”，并且威胁说，卡斯特罗的言论“很难促进”两国政府之间的“谅解和适宜的关系”，力图把古巴同美国关系恶化的责任推到古巴政府的身上。
    美国国务院发言人怀特在19日发表的声明中虽然承认，经过“调查”，这架飞机是从迈阿密城附近的泰米阿米机场起飞的，但是，他又强调这架飞机是“私人飞机”，这次飞行是“未经过许可的”。声明对今后如何停止这种轰炸罪行并没有提出任何具体保证，并且说，他对美国“是否采取措施以逮捕这次袭击的同谋犯一无所知”。（附图片）
