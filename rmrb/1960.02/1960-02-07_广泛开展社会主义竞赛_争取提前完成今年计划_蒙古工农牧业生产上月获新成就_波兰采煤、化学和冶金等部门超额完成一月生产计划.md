Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator. Building on the significant achievements of last year, the working people on Mongolia's industrial, agricultural, and pastoral fronts are in high spirits, putting forward guarantees to complete this year's production plans ahead of schedule and exceed them. Some factories and mines have even launched challenges.

    The entire staff and workers of Mongolia's largest factory, the Choibalsan Industrial Complex, having completed January's production plan three days ahead of schedule, recently issued a socialist emulation challenge to all the staff and workers of the Nalaikh Coal Mine to welcome the 39th anniversary of the Mongolian People's Revolution. In their challenge, the entire staff and workers of the factory guaranteed to complete all targets of this year's first-half production plan five days ahead of schedule, increase labor productivity by 10%, and reduce production costs by 3%. They proposed to save 500,000 tugriks by utilizing waste materials and improving the quality of finished products to support agricultural and pastoral cooperatives. In addition, they proposed that over 2,700 staff and workers participate in various levels of workers' spare-time cultural schools within six months and that 1,000 workers master new technologies.

    In agriculture and animal husbandry, Mongolia's state-owned farms and ranches are also striving for even greater victories this year. To date, five state-owned farms and ranches in Mongolia have successively received national medals, awards, and certificates for their outstanding agricultural achievements last year. They have successively submitted guarantees to the Party Central Committee and the Council of Ministers to complete the 1960 plan ahead of schedule. The Uvurkhangai State-Owned Farm and Ranch proposed to expand the cultivated area to 11,513 hectares in 1960, with a grain yield per hectare exceeding the state plan's target of 9 quintals, reaching 16.5 quintals. It also stated that it would complete 106% of the state's livestock breeding plan this year. This year, the cultivated area of the Tsagaantolgai State-Owned Farm and Ranch will be expanded by 80% compared to last year, and livestock will increase by 18% compared to last year.

    Currently, Mongolia's state-owned farms and ranches and agricultural and pastoral cooperatives have already begun preparations for spring plowing, and lambing has begun in some areas, presenting a thriving scene of production.

    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, February 4th. According to local newspaper reports, Poland's coal mining, chemical, and metallurgical industries have all overfulfilled their January production plans.

    The coal mining industry over-mined more than 250,000 tons of coal by January 30th, completing the month's production plan. The "Dimitrov" mine performed most outstandingly, completing its monthly production plan four days ahead of schedule.

    The excellent achievements of the coal mining industry are inseparable from the continuous improvement of miners' labor productivity. In December last year, each working day saw 1,217 kilograms of coal mined, while in January this year, it reached 1,265 kilograms.

    The chemical industry completed 101% of the January plan. This month's chemical industry production increased by 17.4% compared to the same period last year.

    The metallurgical industry's January production increased by 4% compared to December last year; over-produced 8,400 tons of coke, 3,500 tons of steel, and more than 4,000 tons of steel products.

    Poland's railway transportation also completed its January freight plan.

    广泛开展社会主义竞赛　争取提前完成今年计划
    蒙古工农牧业生产上月获新成就
    波兰采煤、化学和冶金等部门超额完成一月生产计划
    新华社乌兰巴托电　蒙古工农牧业战线上的劳动人民在去年取得重大成就的基础上，斗志昂扬地纷纷提出要提前和超额完成今年生产计划的保证。一些厂矿并展开了挑战。
    蒙古最大的工厂——乔巴山工业联合工厂全体职工在提前三天完成今年1月份生产计划后，为了迎接蒙古人民革命胜利三十九周年，最近向那来河煤矿的全体职工提出了社会主义竞赛的挑战书。这个工厂的全体职工在挑战书中保证提前五天完成今年上半年生产计划的各项指标，提高劳动生产率10％，降低生产成本3％。他们提出要通过利用废料和提高成品质量的方法，节约五十万图格里克，以便支援农牧业合作社；此外，还提出在半年内要使二千七百多名职工参加各级职工业余文化学校学习，使一千名工人掌握新技术。
    在农牧业方面，蒙古各国营农牧场也争取在今年取得更大的胜利。到目前为止，蒙古已有五个国营农牧场因去年农业上的卓越成绩而先后获得国家勋章、奖章和奖状。它们纷纷向党中央和部长会议提出提前完成1960年计划的保证。优热国营农牧场提出1960年耕地面积要扩大到一万一千五百一十三公顷，每公顷谷物产量将超过国家计划规定的九公担指标，而达到十六点五公担。它还表示今年要完成国家的增殖牲畜计划的106％。今年，查干陶勒盖国营农牧场的耕地面积将比去年扩大80％，牲畜将比去年增殖18％。
    现在，蒙古各国营农牧场和农牧业合作社已经投入准备春耕的工作，有的地方已经开始接羔，生产上呈现一片繁荣景象。
    新华社华沙4日电　据此间报纸报道，波兰的采煤、化学和冶金等工业部门都超额完成了1月份的生产计划。
    采煤工业部门在1月30日就超额开采二十五万多吨煤，完成了这个月的生产计划。“季米特洛夫”矿井完成任务最为出色，它提前四天完成了月度生产计划。
    采煤工业部门之所以取得这些出色的成绩，是和矿工劳动生产率的不断提高分不开的。去年12月份，每个工作日采煤一千二百一十七公斤，而今年1月份便达到了一千二百六十五公斤。
    化学工业以101％的成绩完成了1月份计划。这个月的化学工业生产比去年同期增长了17．4％。
    冶金工业部门1月份的生产比去年12月份增长了4％；超计划生产了八千四百吨焦炭，钢——三千五百吨，钢材——四千多吨。
    波兰的铁路运输也完成了1月份货运计划。
