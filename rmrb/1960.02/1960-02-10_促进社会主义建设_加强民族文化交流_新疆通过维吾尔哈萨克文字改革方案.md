Promoting Socialist Construction and Strengthening National Cultural Exchange
Xinjiang Adopts Uyghur and Kazakh Language Reform Plans

    (Our report) The language reform plans for the two major ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region—the Uyghur and Kazakh—were drafted at the recently held Second Autonomous Region National Language and Writing Science Symposium and approved by the Autonomous Region People's Committee. The plan stipulates that the Uyghur and Kazakh languages adopt the Latin alphabet based on the Chinese phonetic alphabet to replace the original Arabic alphabet, and use the same phonetic method as Chinese Pinyin, so that the Uyghur and Kazakh people can establish a convenient bridge with the Han people and other ethnic groups using the Latin alphabet in terms of writing, which is conducive to cultural exchange and unity among all ethnic groups.

    Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region have made rapid progress in political, economic, and scientific and cultural construction, and a large number of new things and new concepts that could not be expressed in the old writing system have emerged. In order to adapt to the development of socialist construction, the autonomous region established language and writing research institutions in 1955 and began to reform the Uyghur and Kazakh writing systems. In the past few years, under the leadership of the autonomous region's Party organization and with the help of the Central Institute for Nationalities Languages, it has conducted extensive surveys and research on the languages and writing systems of various ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. The minority languages survey team organized by the Chinese Academy of Sciences went to Xinjiang three times from 1956 to 1958, penetrating into minority ethnic areas, extensively collecting dialects, local languages, and writing materials of Uyghur, Kazakh, Kirghiz, Tajik, and other ethnic groups, helping the autonomous region establish language research institutions in various places, accumulating a lot of experience in reforming writing, and training a large number of language science research, language teaching, and new writing promotion cadres; and sorted out new vocabulary and terminology for Uyghur, Kazakh, Mongolian, and Xibe ethnic groups. On this basis, the autonomous region's language research institutions, according to the State Council's several principles for designing letters in minority language reform plans, drafted new writing plans for the Uyghur and Kazakh ethnic groups. In order to make the reform plan more perfect, dozens of symposiums including people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life were held successively in Urumqi, Yili, Kashi and other places to widely discuss the new writing plan and absorb useful suggestions from all parties.

    The writing reforms of the Uyghur and Kazakh ethnic groups implemented the Party's spirit that minority language reforms must be conducive to national unity and socialist construction. The new writing plans for Uyghur and Kazakh adopt the twenty-six Latin letters based on the Chinese phonetic alphabet to replace the original Arabic letters, and create eight new letters according to the special phonetics in Uyghur and Kazakh languages, and achieve consistency with Chinese in pronunciation and usage; at the same time, the differences in the past Uyghur and Kazakh languages have also been unified in the new writing plan. This makes it possible for the Uyghur and Kazakh ethnic groups to build a convenient bridge for cultural exchange with all ethnic groups in the country, especially with the Han people. The new writing is concise, has fewer marking symbols, and is easy to distinguish, overcoming the shortcomings of the original Uyghur and Kazakh writing systems, which had too many dots and symbols and were difficult to remember. At the same time, the original Uyghur and Kazakh writing systems borrowed Arabic letters and were written from right to left, while mathematical, chemical, and physical formulas and various numbers were written from left to right according to international practice, which was very inconvenient for writing and printing. The new writing adopts international practice and changes to writing from left to right, which can greatly improve the efficiency of writing, printing, and publishing.

    In socialist construction, the connection between the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region and the Han people has been greatly strengthened. The new vocabulary and terminology standardization plan adopted by this language science symposium determined that new vocabulary that is not available among the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region will be directly borrowed from Chinese, including new vocabulary and terminology in political, economic, cultural, and various construction undertakings. As for many new vocabulary and terminology in the Party's guidelines, policies, and resolution documents, they have long become the common language of all ethnic groups. Representatives of all ethnic groups warmly welcomed the new vocabulary and terminology standardization plan, and unanimously believed that the increase in vocabulary commonly used by all ethnic groups will play a great role in cultural exchange, mutual learning, and mutual approach among all ethnic groups, and in promoting socialist construction and national unity.

    The autonomous region's language research institutions plan to gradually promote the new writing system from 1960, and initially determine that the new writing system will completely replace the old writing system within three to five years. (Tan Feng)

    促进社会主义建设　加强民族文化交流
    新疆通过维吾尔哈萨克文字改革方案
    本报讯　新疆维吾尔自治区两个主要民族——维吾尔族和哈萨克族的文字改革方案，在最近举行的自治区第二次民族语文科学讨论会上拟订出来，并经自治区人民委员会批准。这个方案规定维吾尔、哈萨克两族文字采用以汉语拼音方案为基础的拉丁字母，代替原来的阿拉伯字母，并采用和汉语拼音同样的拼音法，使维吾尔、哈萨克两族人民在文字上和汉族以及采用拉丁字母的其他民族建立方便的桥梁，有利于各民族的文化交流和团结。
    解放以来，自治区各族人民在党的领导下，在政治、经济和科学文化建设事业方面有了飞跃发展，出现了大量为旧文字所不能表达的新事物、新概念。为了适应社会主义建设的发展，自治区在1955年建立了语言、文字研究机构，着手对维吾尔文字和哈萨克文字的改革工作。几年来，它在自治区党组织的领导下，在中央少数民族语言科学研究所的帮助下，对新疆各少数民族语言和文字进行了广泛的调查研究。中国科学院组织的少数民族语言调查队，从1956年到1958年三次到新疆，深入各少数民族聚居区，广泛搜集了维吾尔、哈萨克、柯尔克孜、塔吉克等族的方言、土语和文字资料，帮助自治区在各地建立语文研究机构，积累了不少改革文字的工作经验，培养了大批语文科学研究、语文教学和推行新文字的干部；整理了维吾尔、哈萨克、蒙古、锡伯等族的新词术语。在这个基础上，自治区语文研究机构，根据国务院关于少数民族文字改革方案中设计字母的几项原则，拟订了维吾尔和哈萨克两族的新文字方案。为了使改革方案更为完善，先后在乌鲁木齐、伊犁、喀什等地举行了几十次包括各民族、各阶层人士的座谈会，就新文字方案进行了广泛讨论，吸取了各方面有益的建议。
    维吾尔和哈萨克两个民族的文字改革，贯彻了党的关于少数民族文字改革必须有利于民族团结和社会主义建设事业的精神。维吾尔和哈萨克的新文字方案采用汉语拼音方案为基础的二十六个拉丁字母，代替原来的阿拉伯字母，并根据维吾尔、哈萨克语中的特殊语音，另创造八个新字母，在读音和用法上也与汉语取得了一致；同时，过去维吾尔、哈萨克文中的差异部分在新文字方案中也取得了一致。这就使得维吾尔、哈萨克两民族同全国各族人民，特别是同汉族人民之间互相交流文化建立起便利的桥梁。新的文字简洁，标记符号少，易于区分，克服了原来维吾尔文和哈萨克文中，点和符号过多，难于记忆的缺点。同时，原来的维吾尔文和哈萨克文系借用阿拉伯字母，书写自右向左，而数学、化学、物理学的公式以及各种数字都按国际习惯自左向右，书写和印刷都非常不便。新文字采用国际习惯，改为自左向右，可以大大提高书写、印刷和出版工作效率。
    在社会主义建设中，自治区各族人民与汉族人民的联系大大加强了。这次语文科学讨论会通过的关于新词术语规范化方案确定，在自治区各族人民群众中所没有的新词汇，今后将直接借用汉语汉词，包括政治、经济、文化以及各方面建设事业中的新词术语。至于党的方针、政策和决议文件中的许多新词术语，则早已成了各民族共同的语言。各民族代表热烈欢迎新词术语规范化方案，一致认为，各族人民共同使用的词汇的增多，对各民族文化交流、互相学习、互相接近，促进社会主义建设和民族团结，都将起很大的作用。
    自治区语文研究机构准备从1960年起，逐步推行新文字，初步确定在三年到五年内使新文字全部代替旧文字。　（谈风）
