Xinhua News Agency, 9th: Notice from the CCP Central Committee and the State Council on Convening a National Representative Conference of Advanced Units and Advanced Workers in Socialist Construction in Education, Culture, Health, Sports, and Other Fields

February 9, 1960

Since 1958, under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line for building socialism, the people of the whole country have broken down superstitions, emancipated their minds, and given full play to revolutionary drive and communist spirit, launching a great leap forward in all aspects of socialist construction. Especially after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CCP in 1959, under the call of the Central Committee to oppose Right deviation and encourage greater effort, the people of the whole country have further launched a new upsurge in economic and cultural construction. Two consecutive years of great leap forwards have created a new situation of high-speed development in China's socialist construction.

The millions of educators and workers in culture, health, sports, and other fields on the national cultural and educational front, under the leadership of the Party, and after the rectification and anti-Rightist struggle from 1957 to 1958, have greatly improved their political and ideological awareness. In 1958, under the banner of the Party's General Line, in coordination with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, a powerful cultural and educational revolution movement was launched. In 1959, the Party's education policy continued to be implemented, and the national cultural and educational undertakings were further developed and improved. Currently, there are 1,010,000 students in full-time, part-time, and spare-time universities and colleges, more than 12,000,000 students in various types of secondary schools, and the enrollment rate of school-age children reached 87% in 1959. In rural areas, 120,000,000 people are participating in literacy and spare-time education, and in factories and mines, more than 16,000,000 people are participating in various types of spare-time schools. Nearly 50,000,000 children are now in kindergartens and nurseries. The patriotic health campaign, centered on eliminating the four pests, emphasizing hygiene, and eliminating major diseases, has achieved great success. The cultural and artistic undertakings have seen an unprecedented flourishing scene. Sports and other cultural and educational undertakings have also seen extremely rapid development and improvement. The broad masses of educators and workers in culture, health, sports, and other fields on the cultural and educational front have achieved great results through selfless labor and hard work in the great leap forward of cultural and educational undertakings. Encouraged by the continuous great leap forwards in 1958 and 1959, they are continuing to create even better achievements with higher revolutionary enthusiasm and greater revolutionary drive. In recent years, numerous advanced units and advanced workers have emerged continuously on the cultural and educational front.

In order to promote the continued leap forward of education and culture, health, sports, and other undertakings; in order to commend the advanced units and advanced workers who have emerged on the education front and the cultural, health, and sports fronts; and in order to summarize and exchange experiences, the CCP Central Committee and the State Council have decided to convene a National Representative Conference of Advanced Units and Advanced Workers in Socialist Construction in Education, Culture, Health, Sports, and Other Fields in Beijing in June 1960.
