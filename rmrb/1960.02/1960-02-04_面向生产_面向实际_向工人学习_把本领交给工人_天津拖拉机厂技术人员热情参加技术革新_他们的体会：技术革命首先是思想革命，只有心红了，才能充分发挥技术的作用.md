    Face Production, Face Reality, Learn from Workers, Pass on Skills to Workers
    Tianjin Tractor Factory Technical Personnel Enthusiastically Participate in Technical Innovation
    Their Experience: Technical Revolution is First and Foremost Ideological Revolution; Only with a Red Heart Can We Give Full Play to the Role of Technology
    (Our Newspaper Tianjin, 3rd dispatch) The Tianjin Tractor Manufacturing Factory Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, through conducting thorough and meticulous ideological education and vigorously launching mass movements, organized engineering and technical personnel to consciously and proactively integrate with workers, enabling them to fully exert their role in the technical innovation movement. As a result of the close integration of workers and technical personnel, this factory has implemented more than 300 major innovation measures since last year, comprehensively resolving quality problems in tractor production. It only took about half a year for the factory's tractor production to shift from small-batch trial production to large-scale production.

    The engineering and technical personnel who have plunged into the mass movement have played an important role in technical innovation. They actively use their technical theories to help workers design, draw, or calculate, enabling workers' innovative suggestions to be realized more quickly and completely. Under the surging tide of technical innovation, the factory's production conditions have undergone new changes. Workers need to master some production technologies that they were originally unfamiliar with. Engineering and technical personnel help workers shorten the process from unfamiliarity to familiarity by giving lectures, providing on-site guidance, and teaching hand-in-hand. The factory's technical personnel, based on technical theory, also combined with workers to propose and implement more comprehensive technical innovation plans such as the mechanization of casting sprue hammering, the rail transport, and the mechanization of modeling. Recently, they have also begun pilot work on the development of processing workshops towards automated and semi-automated production lines.

    The Tianjin Tractor Manufacturing Factory successfully trial-produced tractors at the end of 1958. Problems such as improving tractor quality, manufacturing key equipment, and adjusting production lines all required close cooperation between engineering and technical personnel and workers to study and solve. The factory's Party committee decided to help engineering and technical personnel catch up with the new situation of technical innovation by grasping ideology, grasping competition, grasping their integration with workers, and grasping their internal cooperation. The Party committee constantly held report meetings, discussion meetings, and symposiums for them, and sometimes organized them to study together with workers or visit other factories to help them improve their ideological understanding. The factory's leading comrades also often had heart-to-heart talks with them, inspiring them to constantly use the spirit of the General Line to measure their work. Many engineering and technical personnel, under the patient education of the Party, understood the principle that only with a red heart can they play a greater role, and actively plunged into the upsurge of the mass movement. The whole factory launched a matching competition from design, technology, technical inspection and other departments to workshops, and a competition of the same type was carried out between designers in the design department and the technology department, as well as between the technical departments and the production service personnel in each workshop. Engineering and technical personnel actively participated in the "Five Goods" mass movement of "Good in politics, good in production, good in study, good in cooperation, and good in unity."

    The torrent of the mass movement quickly changed the passive and conservative thinking of some engineering and technical personnel, such as sticking to conventions and being afraid of taking risks. In the past, starting from drawing a dotted line to finishing a drawing, "being solely responsible" was considered "a matter of course" by technical personnel. This time, the draftsmen in the design department, because the technical innovation movement required the supply of drawings to be more numerous, faster, and better, broke the old rules and adopted the drafting assembly line method, with specialists responsible for drawing lines, specialists responsible for drawing circles, rational division of labor, and close cooperation, greatly improving work efficiency.

    In the "Five Goods" movement, the cooperative relationship between engineering and technical personnel also became closer and closer. When the technology department was under pressure, the technical personnel from the design department and the technical inspection department came to support; the technology department also carried out cooperation between groups and between individuals. As a result, the tasks in the technology work have been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the quota every month since last September. Lu Zaihou, a hot processing engineer, and Tang Kaifang, a cold processing technician, had insufficient contact in the past, which affected the quality of precision gears. In the matching competition, they both examined their shortcomings, proposed a guarantee to be considerate of each other's difficulties, jointly formed a shock team, and, together with the workers, carefully analyzed the cold and hot processing conditions when manufacturing gears, jointly improved the processing methods, and made the quality of the gears fully meet the standards stipulated by the state. Some technical personnel in the department also assisted in solving some problems in the management of the workshop by improving cranes and other measures. For example, the engineering and technical personnel in the product testing laboratory did not dare to trial-produce an automatic recording traction machine. Because in this instrument, which is less than a foot square, there are hundreds of complex and precise parts, requiring two motors the size of eggs, and the speed per minute must be as high as five or six thousand revolutions. This time, with the great cooperation of many technical personnel and the active actions of the workers, it was finally manufactured.

    Many vivid examples in the mass movement have promoted the integration of engineering and technical personnel with workers. Now, many engineering and technical personnel often go to the workers like "collecting folk songs" to record workers' opinions on improving the design as a reference for their own designs. Some people pay attention to understanding the specific requirements of workers for future mechanized equipment or new tools when working with workers. Now, before improving product design or designing technological equipment, going to the workshop to solicit workers' opinions and then making a plan has become their frequent working method. This makes much technical work such as product and process design done quickly, well, and economically.

    面向生产　面向实际　向工人学习　把本领交给工人
    天津拖拉机厂技术人员热情参加技术革新
    他们的体会：技术革命首先是思想革命，只有心红了，才能充分发挥技术的作用
    本报天津3日电　中共天津拖拉机制造厂委员会，通过进行深入细致的思想教育和大搞群众运动，组织工程技术人员自觉地、主动地同工人结合，使他们在技术革新运动中充分发挥了作用。这个厂由于工人和技术人员紧密结合，去年以来已经实现了三百多项重大的革新措施，比较全面地解决了拖拉机生产中的质量问题；只花了半年左右的时间，这个厂的拖拉机生产就由小批试制转向大批生产。
    投入群众运动中的工程技术人员，在技术革新中发挥了重要作用。他们积极地以自己的技术理论，帮助工人设计、绘图或计算，使工人的革新建议实现得更为迅速，更为完整。在技术革新风起云涌的形势下，工厂的生产条件发生了新的变化，工人要掌握一些原来不熟悉的生产技术，工程技术人员便通过讲课、现场指导、把着手教等方式，帮助工人缩短了从生疏到熟悉的过程。这个工厂的技术人员还根据技术理论，同工人结合，提出并实现了铸工的浇铸冒口锤击化、运输轨道化、造型机械化等比较全面的技术革新规划。最近，他们又开始了加工车间向自动化、半自动化生产线方向发展的试点工作。
    天津拖拉机制造厂在1958年底试制成功拖拉机。关于改进拖拉机质量、制造关键性设备、调整生产线路等方面的问题，都需要工程技术人员同工人紧密配合研究解决。厂党委决定通过抓思想，抓竞赛，抓他们和工人的结合，抓他们内部的协作，来帮助工程技术人员赶上技术革新的新形势。党委不断为他们举行报告会、讨论会、座谈会等，有时还组织他们和工人一起学习，或者去外厂参观，帮助他们提高思想认识。工厂的领导同志还常常和他们促膝谈心，启发他们经常用总路线的精神衡量自己的工作。许多工程技术人员在党的耐心教育下，懂得了只有心红才能起更大作用的道理，积极投入了群众运动的热潮。全厂掀起了从设计、工艺、技术检验等科室到车间不同系统的对口赛；在设计科和工艺科的设计人员之间，以及各技术科室、各车间的生产服务人员之间，开展了同工种竞赛。工程技术人员纷纷投入了“政治挂帅好，生产好，学习好，协作好，团结好”的五好群众运动。
    群众运动的激流，迅速改变了一些工程技术人员的因循守旧、“前怕龙、后怕虎”等消极保守思想。过去，从划点线开始到描完一张图纸，“单独负责”这是技术人员认为是“天经地义”的事情。这一次，设计科的描图员因为技术革新运动要求又多又快又好地供应图纸，他们就打破老规矩，采取了描图流水作业法，划线的专管划线，画圆的专门画圆，合理分工，严密配合，工作效率大大提高。
    在“五好”运动中，工程技术人员之间的协作关系也越来越密切了。工艺科任务紧张，设计科、技术检验科的技术人员就来支援；工艺科的内部也开展了组与组、人与人之间的协作。结果工艺工作方面的任务，自去年9月以来，月月都提前超额完成。热加工工程师陆载厚、冷加工技术员唐开方，过去联系不够，曾影响了精密齿轮的质量；在对口竞赛中，他们都检查了自己的缺点，提出了要体贴对方困难的保证，共同组成了突击队，和工人一道，仔细分析了制造齿轮时的冷热加工的情况，共同改进了加工方法，使齿轮的质量完全达到了国家规定的标准。有些属于车间管理工作方面的问题，科室的技术人员也通过改进吊车等措施来协助解决。又如产品试验室的工程技术人员，原来不敢试制自动记录牵引力机。因为在这种不到一尺见方的仪器里，有着几百种复杂、精密的零件，需要两台像鸡蛋那样大小的马达，而每分钟的转速要高达五、六千转。这次，经过许多技术人员的大协作，工人们的积极行动，最后制成了。
    群众运动中许多生动的事例，推动着工程技术人员同工人的结合。现在，不少工程技术人员经常像“采风”似地到工人中记录工人关于改进设计的意见，作为自己设计时的参考。有些人在同工人一起劳动的时候，注意了解工人对未来的机械化设备或新工具的具体要求。现在，在改进产品设计或是设计工艺装备等以前，先到车间去征求工人的意见，然后再搞方案，已经成了他们经常的工作方法。这便使产品和工艺设计等许多技术工作，做到了多快好省。
