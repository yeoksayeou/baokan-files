The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council issued instructions on current vegetable work, calling for a greater victory on the vegetable production front this year, first and foremost to win a bumper harvest of spring vegetables. Increasing the production of vegetables in all seasons, especially spring vegetables, is not only an important economic task, but also an important political task. With the great leap forward in socialist construction and the victorious development of people's communes, the demand for vegetables by urban and rural people is increasing; due to the great development of animal husbandry, the demand for melons and vegetables used as feed is also required to greatly increase. Massively increasing vegetable production is a major task for local Party committees, agricultural departments, and commercial departments.

Last year, many places across the country paid attention to vegetable production. Many cities implemented the policy of striving for vegetable self-sufficiency, and most areas achieved basic vegetable self-sufficiency. Rural people's communes universally implemented the practice of allocating vegetable plots per person, fully utilizing scattered land, and planting high-yield early-maturing melons and vegetables. In many places, despite suffering severe disasters in the summer and autumn, they still won a bumper harvest of vegetables by relying on the powerful strength of the people's communes. The total production of various vegetables throughout the year was about 500 billion jin, an increase of about one time compared with 1958. The vegetable supply in many cities has increased many times over. In rural areas, thanks to more vegetables, the food in public canteens has been continuously improved, which is welcomed by the broad masses. Even in areas affected by natural disasters, people's lives have improved due to increased vegetable production.

Now, we must further grasp spring vegetable production on the basis of the great achievements made on the vegetable front last year. At the same time, we must plan the annual vegetable production in a planned and measured way, and strive for a greater victory than last year. There are two erroneous views on vegetable production that must be corrected. One is that they only see the bumper harvest of autumn vegetables last year, with a lot of vegetables temporarily stored, and do not see the increasing demand for vegetables by urban and rural people, so they do not pay enough attention to spring vegetable production. This is wrong. It is a fact that there were more autumn vegetables harvested last year in some places, but the actual demand this year has greatly increased compared to last year. Only by vigorously developing spring vegetables can we meet the needs of all parties. Missing this opportunity will affect people's lives. Another view is that there has always been a vegetable "slack season" every year. In many places, especially in the north, there is a period of shortage of fresh vegetables in March and April or April and May every year, which is customary and unchangeable. This is also wrong. Eating fresh and tender vegetables is the common demand of the masses. Before the people's communes, this demand could not be met due to various restrictions. After the people's communes, a great leap forward in vegetable production has been achieved in 1959, and it is possible to continue to leap forward this year, so that the off-season is not off-season, and to ensure that urban, industrial, and mining areas and rural people can eat fresh spring vegetables, and that a certain amount of fresh vegetables can be eaten regularly throughout the year.

Increasing spring vegetable production is not only greatly beneficial to improving the lives of urban and rural people, but also closely related to ensuring the continued leap forward in production and construction. In most areas, March to May, the traditional slack season for vegetables, happens to be the most tense and busiest season for agricultural production in the year. It is necessary to carry out spring plowing and sowing, to harvest overwintering early-maturing crops, and to carry out spring afforestation and rush flood control projects. At such a juncture, special attention should be paid to ensuring that the labor army on all fronts is well-fed and full of energy. If spring vegetables are harvested early and in large quantities, this goal can be achieved. The traditional off-season for vegetables is also a season when feed is relatively scarce. Winning a bumper harvest of spring vegetables will allow the remaining leaves and roots of many vegetables to be used as feed, and the pig-raising industry can develop faster. Producing spring vegetables early and in large quantities can not only strongly support the people in urban and industrial areas, but also greatly increase the income of each production team of the people's commune.

Massively increasing spring vegetable production and striving for a bumper harvest of vegetables in all seasons this year must have a revolutionary will and an innovative spirit. Massively increasing spring vegetable production requires more equipment, and field management also requires more manpower. Fertilizers, seeds, and water conservancy facilities must also be increased accordingly. Now, with the growing strength of the people's communes, the difficulties in terms of manpower, materials, and technology in planting more and earlier spring vegetables can be completely solved by relying on the collective strength of the people's communes. At the beginning of this year, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei and other provinces issued calls to the people of the whole province to launch a mass movement to rush plant early spring vegetables. Because the broad masses have deeply realized the benefits of massively increasing vegetable production, they have come up with many ways to plant spring vegetables earlier and more, contributed greatly, overcome difficulties, and sowed a large area of spring vegetables. At the same time, they also used scattered land to plant a large number of melons and vegetables in nests.

Spring vegetable production is very urgent, and the opportunity is fleeting. Therefore, it is necessary to concentrate the strength of the masses, take a blitzkrieg approach, unify planning, and unify actions to complete the work of leveling the land, making ridges and watering, sending fertilizer and applying fertilizer, selecting seeds and sowing in a very short time; then, hand it over to professional teams for regular management. Sufficient spring vegetable planting area must be guaranteed, and the planting area of vegetables must not be squeezed out due to the development of other crops. Where the land area reserved for spring vegetables is insufficient, various methods should be devised to appropriately expand it according to the actual situation of population increase and increased needs. Intercropping and interplanting methods can also be used to give full play to land fertility. All open and barren land must be utilized as much as possible. Efforts should be made to solve the problem of spring vegetable seeds locally. It is necessary to widely mobilize the masses to find and exchange seeds, organize the exchange of surpluses and shortages between communes and regions, and adopt effective methods such as centralized seedling raising, improved seedling bed management, and planting at equal intervals according to specifications (without or with less thinning) to save seeds.

In order to increase the vegetables needed for spring production, it is also necessary to manage the overwintering vegetables well. The overwintering vegetables in some cities have increased compared with previous years. For example, the planting area of ​​overwintering vegetables in Beijing has expanded by about two times compared with the previous year; greenhouses and solar greenhouses have also increased a lot. These vegetables are turning green and need to be strengthened in management, watering and topdressing, cold protection and wind protection, and strive for lush plants and high yields per mu. The harvest time should also be arranged well, and strive to be uniform.

All localities should continue to strengthen the management of the autumn vegetables currently stored, diligently turn and invert them, pay attention to ventilation, and prevent rot. At the same time, pay attention to planning vegetable use and avoid waste.

Increasing spring vegetable production is a major event to improve people's lives. In the past, under the conditions of decentralized production, it was difficult to do this well. Now, relying on the strength of the people's communes, implementing political command under the unified leadership of the Party, carrying out mass movements, and developing collective vegetable growing can greatly increase spring vegetable production in urban and rural areas. Since the people's communes were able to overcome various difficulties and win a bumper harvest of autumn vegetables last year, it can be completely affirmed that a bumper harvest of spring vegetables will surely be won this year.

### 大量增产春菜

    大量增产春菜
    中共中央和国务院发布了关于当前蔬菜工作的指示，这个指示号召今年在蔬菜生产战线上取得更大的胜利，首先是要夺得春菜的大丰收。增产各季蔬菜、首先是春季蔬菜，这不单是重要的经济任务，也是重要的政治任务。随着社会主义建设的大跃进和人民公社的胜利发展，城乡人民对于蔬菜的需要是越来越多了；由于畜牧业的大发展，用作饲料的瓜菜也要求大大增加。大量增产蔬菜，是各地党委和农业部门、商业部门的重大任务。
    去年，全国许多地方都注意了蔬菜生产。许多城市贯彻执行了争取蔬菜自给的方针，绝大部分地区做到了蔬菜基本自给。农村人民公社普遍实行按人划定菜地、充分利用零星土地、大种高产早熟瓜菜。不少地方在夏秋连遭严重灾害的情况下，依靠人民公社的强大力量，仍然夺得了蔬菜的大丰收。全年生产各种蔬菜共约五千亿斤，比1958年增加大约一倍。许多城市的蔬菜供应量都成倍地增加。在农村，由于有了比较多的蔬菜，公共食堂的伙食不断改进，受到广大群众的欢迎。即使在受了自然灾害的地区，群众生活也因蔬菜增产而有所改善。
    现在，我们要在去年蔬菜战线取得的伟大成绩的基础上进一步抓紧春季蔬菜生产，同时，有计划、有措施地把全年的蔬菜生产安排好，争取比去年更大的胜利。对于蔬菜生产，有两种错误的看法必须纠正。一种是只看到去年秋菜大丰收，一时存菜不少，没有看到城乡人民对蔬菜需要的日益增长，因而对于春菜生产没有足够的重视。这是不对的。去年秋菜大丰收，有些地方一时显得多了一些是事实，但是今年的实际需要比去年是大大增加了。只有大力发展春菜，才能满足各方面的需要，错过这个时机，就会影响人民的生活。另一种看法是，认为历来年年都有一个蔬菜“淡季”。许多地方，特别是北方各地，历年3、4月间或者4、5月间，都有一个时期缺少新鲜蔬菜吃，习以为常，不可改变。这也是不对的。吃鲜嫩的蔬菜是群众的共同要求。人民公社化以前，由于种种条件的限制，这种要求是不可能得到满足的。人民公社化以后，1959年已经实现了蔬菜生产大跃进，今年也有可能继续跃进，使淡季不淡，保证城市、工矿区和农村人民吃到新鲜的春菜，并要在一年四季经常都能吃到一定数量的新鲜蔬菜。
    增加春菜生产，不但大大有利于改善城乡人民生活，也同保证生产建设的继续跃进有密切的关系。就大部分地区来说，3月到5月，历年蔬菜的淡季，又恰恰是一年中农业生产最紧张最繁忙的季节，既要大搞春耕春播，又要抢收越冬早熟作物，同时还要大搞春季造林和突击防汛工程等等。在这样的关头，正应该特别注意保证各个战线上的劳动大军吃饱吃好、精神百倍。如果春菜收得又早又多，就可以达到这样的目的。历年蔬菜的淡季，也正是饲料比较缺乏的季节。争得了春菜大丰收，许多蔬菜的残叶根茎就可以作为饲料，养猪事业就可以更快地发展。春菜生产得又早又多，不仅可以有力地支援城市和工矿区人民，而且可以大大增加人民公社各生产队的收入。
    大量增产春菜，争取今年蔬菜四季丰收，必须有革命的意志和革新的精神。大量增产春菜需要较多的设备，田间管理也需要较多的人力，肥料、种子和水利设施等等也要相应地增加。现在，随着人民公社的力量日益强大，多种早种春菜在人力上物力上技术上的困难，完全可以依靠人民公社的集体力量来加以解决。今年年初，四川、湖南、湖北等省，分别向全省人民群众发出开展突击抢种早春蔬菜的群众运动的号召。广大群众由于已经深刻体会到大量增产蔬菜的好处，就为早种和多种春菜想出了许多办法，贡献了很大力量，克服了困难，播种了很大面积的春菜，同时还利用零星土地一窝一窝地种植了大量的瓜菜。
    春菜生产时间非常紧迫，时机稍纵即逝。因此，必须集中群众力量，采取突击方式，统一规划，统一行动，把平整土地、做畦浇水、送肥施肥、选种播种等等工作，都在很短时间之内通通做好；然后，交给专业队去经常管理。必须保证足够的春菜种植面积，不能因为发展其他作物，挤掉蔬菜的种植面积。凡是春菜留地面积不足的地方，应该想种种办法，按照人口增加、需要增加的实际情况，适当扩大。还可以采用套种、间种的办法，充分发挥地力。对一切空地荒地，都要尽可能加以利用。春菜种子，要力求就地解决。要广泛发动群众找种、换种，组织各公社之间、各地区之间互通有无、调剂余缺，还可以采取集中育苗、改进苗床管理、按规格等距种植（不间苗或少间苗）等等行之有效的好办法节约种子。
    为了增产春季所需要的蔬菜，还必须把越冬蔬菜管理好。有些城市的越冬蔬菜比往年有所增加。如北京市的越冬蔬菜的种植面积就比上一年扩大了大约两倍；温室和阳畦蔬菜也增加了很多。这些蔬菜正在返青，需要加强管理、浇水追肥、防寒挡风，力争棵棵茂盛，亩亩高产。收获的时间也要好好安排，力求均匀。
    各地对于现在储存的秋菜，应当继续加强保管，勤翻勤倒，注意通风，防止腐烂。同时在使用上注意计划用菜，避免浪费。
    增加春菜生产，是改善群众生活的大事情。在过去分散生产的条件下，很难把这件事情办好。现在，依靠人民公社的力量，在党的统一领导下实行政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，发展集体种菜，就可以在城乡广大地区大量增产春菜。既然去年人民公社能够战胜种种困难夺得了秋菜大丰收，那末，可以完全肯定，今年也一定能夺得春菜的大丰收。
