Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, February 24th: The Matan Brigade of the Qilihe Commune in Lanzhou recently erected a large bridge over the Yellow River. The bridge has nine concrete piers. The upper part of the bridge is mainly made of wood. The bridge is one hundred and fifty meters long and four meters wide, allowing two horse-drawn carriages to pass side by side.

The Matan Brigade is located on Matan Island in the heart of the Yellow River, and mainly produces melons, fruits, and non-staple foods. Surrounded by the river on all sides, it used to rely on leather rafts for transportation. After communization, under the unified leadership of the commune, the people of Matan raised more than 100,000 yuan in funds, contributed more than 16,000 workdays, and after nine months of construction, finally completed the bridge.

During the construction of the bridge, the Matan Brigade received strong support from the workers and staff of factories and enterprises in Lanzhou. Units such as the Lanzhou General Machinery Factory, the Lanzhou Cement Pipe Factory, and the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering all took the initiative to send cadres and technicians to help solve technical problems; they also supported the project with timber, steel, cement, and 3,600 workdays. To thank the workers for their assistance, the members of the Matan Brigade have named the Yellow River bridge the "Worker-Peasant Bridge".

    黄河上的“工农大桥”
    据新华社兰州24日电　兰州市七里河公社马滩大队最近在黄河上架起了一座大桥。这座大桥共有九个混凝土墩，桥的上部主要是木制的，桥身全长一百五十米，宽四米，可以并行两辆马车。
    马滩大队处在黄河河心的马滩上，主要生产瓜果与副食品，四面靠河，过去依靠皮筏子往来运输。公社化后，马滩人民在公社的统一领导下，筹集十多万元资金，用工一万六千多个，经过九个月的施工，终于建成了这座大桥。
    在建桥过程中，马滩大队得到了兰州市工厂企业职工的大力支援，兰州通用机器厂、兰州水泥制管厂、建筑工程部第三工程局等单位都主动派出干部、技术人员，帮助解决技术问题；还支援了木料、钢材、水泥和三千六百个工日。马滩大队的社员们为了感谢工人的援助，已经命名这座黄河桥为“工农大桥”。
