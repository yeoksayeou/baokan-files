    Little Ding Learns to Sew
    In the ditch-digging construction site of the Baodian People's Commune in Ningjin County, Hebei Province, several shop assistants deliver goods to the construction site every day. This is the "logistics force" formed by the Baodian Central Store to support water conservancy construction. In order to ensure that the migrant workers eat well, use well, and enjoy themselves, they also launched a "add service items" competition.
  One day, female shop assistant Fan Yaolin noticed that some migrant workers' clothes were torn and they didn't have time to mend them, so five female shop assistants took needles and thread to the construction site to sell goods and mend clothes at the same time, doing more than 20 pieces of work in one day.
    This made male shop assistant Ding Junru very anxious. What should he do if he didn't know this trick? He was determined to learn at night, and finally mastered the technique of using needles and thread. One day, he pushed a cart full of goods and took needles and thread to the construction site again to deliver goods. It started to rain lightly as soon as he arrived at the construction site. At this time, a young man digging a canal bought a piece of tarpaulin from his truck and pondered how to tie it together. Xiao Ding said, "Bring it here and I'll sew two cloth straps on it for you." The young man was stunned for a moment and said, "We're about the same, I can't sew, and you're not allowed to be much better than me." Xiao Ding took the tarpaulin and sewed on two cloth strips in a moment. The young man took the tarpaulin and admitted defeat, saying, "You are indeed better than me."

    小丁学针线
    在河北省宁津县保店人民公社挖渠工地上，有几个售货员天天串工地送货。这就是保店中心商店为支援水利建设组成的“后勤部队”。为让民工吃好、用好、娱乐好，他们还开展了“增添服务项目”竞赛。
  一天，女售货员范瑶林发觉有的民工衣裳破了没空补，于是五个女售货员就带着针线到工地，边售货、边缝补衣服，一天就做了二十多件活。
    这可把男售货员丁俊如急坏了。自己不会这一着儿怎么办呢？他就下决心在晚上学，终于掌握了使唤针线的技术。一天，他推着满车子商品，带了针线又串工地送货去了。刚到工地就下起了小雨。这时，一个挖渠的小伙子从他的货车上买了一块油布，披在身上反来复去琢磨无法结在一块。小丁就说：“拿来我给你缝上两个布带吧。”这个小伙子楞了一下说：“咱俩差不多，我不会缝，你也不准比我强多少”。小丁拿过油布来一会儿就缝上了两个布条儿。小伙子接过油布来，认输地说：“到底比我强。”
