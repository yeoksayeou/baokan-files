Arming the Province's Industrial Sectors, Supporting Technological Transformation of Agriculture
Nanchang's Machinery Industry Demonstrates its Power

(Our report) Nanchang's machinery industry, which has grown during the Great Leap Forward, is increasingly playing a significant role in arming the province's industrial sectors and supporting the technological transformation of agriculture.

In this year's industrial construction in Jiangxi Province, Nanchang's machinery industry has primarily undertaken the task of arming the county and district-level local industries and commune-run industries. In the first quarter alone, it will manufacture sixty large-scale modern lathes, planers, drilling machines, and hundreds of sets of relatively complex metallurgical, mining, and transportation equipment. To accomplish this task, workers in relevant machinery factories are vigorously engaging in technological innovation and revolution. The satellite team of the foundry workshop at Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory has created a new method for casting engine blocks, using tung oil sand instead of cast iron core skeletons for casting engine blocks, saving oven and sand cleaning time, accelerating the engine block manufacturing progress, and saving large quantities of pig iron and raw materials. After accepting the trial production task of the "Jiangxi No. 1" blower for assembling forty-cubic-meter blast furnace blowing equipment, Nanchang General Machinery Factory adopted a cross-operation method, completing the processing task three days ahead of schedule, enabling the province to successfully trial-produce a complete set of blower equipment ahead of time.

With the acceleration of agricultural technological transformation and the greater leap forward in agricultural production in Jiangxi Province, the agricultural machinery equipment and farm implement production tasks undertaken by Nanchang's machinery industry this year will increase exponentially compared to last year. In the first quarter alone, the manufacturing task of powered machinery, transportation machinery, livestock machinery, agricultural and sideline product processing machinery, power irrigation and drainage equipment, and general mechanical farm tools will reach 300,000 pieces. After receiving the task of manufacturing this batch of agricultural machinery, the forty machinery factories undertaking the task immediately arranged it as the primary task of current production, put forward the fighting slogan of "Do not let machines delay farming," vigorously launched a mass movement of technological innovation and revolution, and carried out crash production. Since the beginning of the year, batches of agricultural machinery have frequently been sent to the countryside to support agricultural production. Workers at Nanchang Agricultural Machinery Factory solved the material difficulties of more than eighty gas stove legs through methods such as excavation, searching, substitution, saving, and utilizing edge angle iron, and achieved more than forty technological innovations, increasing work efficiency by two to thirteen times. In addition to increasing the production of nine sets of gas engines and water turbines at the beginning of the year to support the rural areas, the gas engines manufactured by the factory are now all entering the final assembly stage. Jiangxi Agricultural Machinery Factory undertook the manufacturing task of twenty-one kinds of mechanized farming implements and rice transplanters in the first quarter. To ensure timely delivery to the countryside to support spring plowing, all factory workers vigorously carried out technological innovations and improved tools and equipment. Currently, batches of electric plows, large double-furrow plows, and new-style rice transplanters have been produced, and more than 1,400 agricultural machines will be sent to the countryside before the end of February.

To enable the people's communes to initially learn how to self-inspect, self-repair, imitate, and modify various mechanical farm tools, forty-five machinery and electrical factories in the city have established counterpart connections with the communes, signed contracts, and are helping the communes manufacture three machines (lathe, planer, drilling machine) to ensure that each commune has three machines and each team has five tools (bench drill, vise, file saw, threading tools, iron drill), so that minor repairs of various farm tools do not leave the team, medium repairs do not leave the commune, and major repairs do not leave the county, laying a preliminary foundation for the commune to realize agricultural mechanization.

    武装全省工业部门　支援农业技术改造
    南昌机械工业发挥威力
    本报讯　在大跃进中成长起来的南昌市机械工业，对武装全省工业部门，支援农业技术改造日益发挥着巨大的作用。
    南昌市的机械工业在今年全省工业建设中，首先承担了武装县区地方工业和社办工业的任务。在第一季度里，就要制造出六十台大型的现代化车床、刨床、钻床和上百套技术较为复杂的冶金、矿山、交通运输等设备。为了完成这一任务，有关机械工厂的职工大搞技术革新和技术革命。南昌柴油机厂型铸车间卫星小组，创造了浇铸机体的新办法，用桐油砂代替铸铁泥芯骨铸机体，节约了烘炉、清砂时间，加速了机体制造进度，节约了大批生铁和原料。南昌通用机械厂接受了装配四十立方米高炉鼓风设备的“江西一号”鼓风机的试制任务以后，采取交叉作业方法，提前三天完成加工任务，使全省提前试制成功了全套的鼓风机设备。
    随着江西省农业技术改造速度的加快和农业生产的更大跃进，南昌市机械工业今年担负的农业机械设备和农具生产任务，将比去年成倍增加。在第一季度里，仅机动机械、运输机械、畜牧机械、农副产品加工机械、动力排灌设备以及一般机械农具的制造任务，就达三十万件。承担这批农业机械制造任务的四十个机械工厂，在任务下达以后，都立即把它安排为当前生产的主要任务，提出了“不让机器误农时”的战斗口号，大力开展技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，进行突击赶制。年初以来经常有成批的农业机械下乡支援农业生产。南昌市农业机械厂工人通过挖、找、代、省和利用边缘角铁等办法，解决了八十多台煤气炉脚的材料困难，并且实现技术革新四十多项，提高工效二倍到十三倍。除在年初增产了九台成套的煤气机和水轮机支援农村外，全厂负担制造的煤气机现在已全部进入总装阶段。江西农业机械厂第一季度承担了二十一种机耕农具和插秧机的制造任务。为了保证按时送往农村，支援春耕生产，全厂职工大搞技术革新，改进工具设备，目前已有成批电犁、大型双铧犁、新式插秧机出厂，2月底以前将有一千四百多台农业机械送往农村。
    为了使人民公社能够初步学会自检自修和仿制改制各种机械农具，全市已有四十五家机、电工厂与公社实行对口挂钩，签订了合同，正在帮助公社制造三床（车床、刨床、钻床），做到社社有三床，队队有五具（台钻、虎钳、锉锯、套丝工具、铁钻子），各种农具小修不出队，中修不出社，大修不出县，为公社实现农业机械化打好初步基础。（附图片）
