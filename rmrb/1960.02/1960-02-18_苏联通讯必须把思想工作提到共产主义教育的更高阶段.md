    Soviet Communications Must Elevate Ideological Work to a Higher Stage of Communist Education

    This Dispatch: At a discussion on the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, V. Koucky, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, delivered a report. Koucky pointed out the importance of studying the experience of the CPSU in the report and stressed that "when building the material and technical foundations of a socialist society, we must see that political viewpoints are paramount."

    In his report, in addition to discussing the reorganization of Czechoslovak industry, agricultural production, the dictatorship of the proletariat and the development of socialist countries, and strengthening the leadership of the Party, Koucky also talked about the communist education of the masses.

    When discussing the Party's communist education of the masses, Koucky said: "Our current development and future prospects indicate that we must raise our ideological work to a higher stage of communist education. The activities of the Soviet Communists in this regard provide us with a lot of inspiration.

      "We must fight against the erroneous ideas that still exist, that is, we must completely solve the economic tasks of socialism, improve the people's living standards, and then we can form the consciousness of socialist people. These comrades use the following argument as an excuse: that socialist construction is a process, and its realization inevitably requires a certain amount of time. But they do not see that in terms of building the material and technical foundation, we are temporarily limited by resources and financial resources, while educating new people (without new people, communism is unimaginable) provides our ideological education activities with virtually unlimited space for activities, which we have not yet made good use of.

      "In the work of educating people, moral factors will play an increasingly important role. Because the realization of the slogan 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs' is not now, and will never be, just a material issue - the issue of the quantity of consumer goods we will achieve. The realization of this slogan also requires people with high moral qualities, selfless, brave, ambitious, and with a broad vision and high culture of work and personal life, who will first see the interests of society, the interests of the people and the whole. It must be said that the entire history of our Party shows that educating people in this direction has always played a decisive role. Today, in the work of completing socialist construction, we must further strengthen the education of the working people in the spirit of proletarian internationalism and socialist patriotism.

    "Naturally, we must place higher demands on the education of Communist Party members themselves."

    Finally, Koucky pointed out that it is a very urgent task to conscientiously implement the instructions of the 11th Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and give ideological work a priority in the Party's activities. The problem is that education and systematic persuasion should never be understood as something partial; it is always an integral part and method of all political and organizational work of the Party among the masses.

### 苏联通讯必须把思想工作提到共产主义教育的更高阶段

    苏联通讯必须把思想工作提到共产主义教育的更高阶段
    本报讯　捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会书记弗·考茨基在关于苏联共产党党史的讨论会上作了报告。考茨基在报告中指出学习苏共经验的重要。并强调指出“在建立社会主义社会的物质技术基础时，必须看到政治观点是首要的”。
    考茨基在报告中除谈到捷克斯洛伐克工业改组、农业生产、无产阶级专政和社会主义国家的发展、加强党的领导等问题外，还谈到对群众进行共产主义教育的问题。
    在论述到党对人民群众进行共产主义教育的问题时，考茨基说：“我们目前的发展和将来的远景指出，我们必须把我们的思想工作提高到共产主义教育的更高阶段。苏联共产党人在这方面的活动给我们提供了很多的启示。
      “必须对到目前为止仍在出现的错误想法进行斗争，这就是，我们必须完全解决社会主义的经济任务，提高人民的生活水平，然后我们才能形成社会主义的人的觉悟。这些同志用下面这一论据为借口：即社会主义建设是一个过程，它的实现必不可少地要求有一定的时间。但是他们看不到在物质技术基础的建设方面，我们暂时还受到资源和财力的限制，而教育新的人（没有新的人，共产主义是不可想像的）却给我们的思想教育活动提供了实际上毫无限制的活动场所，我们对此还远没有很好地利用。
      “在教育人的工作中，道德因素将越来越起更大的作用。因为实现‘各尽所能，按需分配’的口号，现在不是、将来也永远不会只是物质问题——我们将要达到的消费品的数量问题。实现这一口号，同时要求有高度道德品质的人，不自私的、勇敢的、有抱负的、对工作以及个人生活有广阔的视野和高度文化的人，这种人将首先看到社会的利益、人民和整体的利益。必须说，我们党的整个历史说明，按照这个方向教育人，始终起了决定性的作用。今天，在完成社会主义建设的工作中，我们必须本着无产阶级国际主义和社会主义爱国主义的精神，还要更加加强对劳动人民的教育。
    “自然我们对教育共产党员本身必须提出更高的要求。”
    最后，考茨基指出，认真贯彻捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十一次代表大会的指示，使思想工作在党的活动中占有优先地位，是非常迫切的任务。问题在于，任何时候都不要把教育和系统的说服工作理解为某种局部的事情，它始终是党在群众中一切政治和组织工作不可分割的组成部分和方法。
