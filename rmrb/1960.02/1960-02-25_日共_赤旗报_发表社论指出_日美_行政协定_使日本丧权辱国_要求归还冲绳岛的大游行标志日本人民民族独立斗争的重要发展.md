Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 24th dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper "Akahata" published an editorial today emphasizing that it is necessary for all activists in Japanese democratic groups to study the new Japan-U.S. "Administrative Agreement" and expose its nature of losing sovereignty and causing humiliation to the people.

The new "Administrative Agreement" was signed in Washington on January 19, simultaneously with the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." This agreement stipulates matters concerning the use of Japanese facilities and areas by the U.S. military, as well as the status of U.S. forces stationed in Japan.

The editorial urged everyone to pay attention to Articles 2 and 23 of the new "Administrative Agreement." It said, "According to Article 2, the bases of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces can be used by the U.S. forces stationed in Japan. This will mean that the U.S. bases in Japan will be greatly expanded overnight."

The editorial said, "According to Article 23, legitimate rights of Japanese workers will be greatly restricted in the name of the 'Security Treaty' and 'secrecy.' In other words, the new 'Administrative Agreement' can easily become an illegal tool used to strengthen political suppression and intensify economic exploitation of workers."

The editorial said, "The new 'Administrative Agreement' gives the U.S. forces stationed in Japan the greatest possible privileges, while making detailed provisions in the name of protecting U.S. bases and military facilities, strictly restricting the rights of the people guaranteed by the (Japanese) Constitution and Japanese sovereignty."

The editorial urged everyone to pay attention to the fact that a total of thirty-two bills related to amending special criminal law, special civil law, and land expropriation law, etc., have been submitted to this ordinary Diet session for approval in order to implement the new "Administrative Agreement."

The editorial said, "If the Diet approves these bills aimed at suppressing the people and turns them into law, this will have a direct and indirect impact on the daily lives of the people, resulting in countless suffering and difficulties for the people."

The editorial concluded by saying that in the struggle to prevent the Diet from approving and strive for the abolition of the new "Security Treaty," it is necessary to expose the actual dangers contained in the new "Administrative Agreement" signed under the new "Security Treaty," thereby further promoting the struggle against the new "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper "Akahata" published an editorial today, calling on all JCP members to devote all their efforts to strive for the victory of the large-scale march demanding the return of Okinawa.

The editorial pointed out that the large-scale march demanding that the United States return Okinawa to Japan has been continuing its advance towards Tokyo since it set out from Kagoshima on January 24, with the full support of workers and various groups across the country. "Akahata" condemned the United States and the Kishi Nobusuke government for still attempting to force the Diet to approve the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," despite the increasingly fierce opposition and protests from the Japanese people.

The editorial pointed out that the large-scale march demanding the return of Okinawa marks an important development in the Japanese people's struggle for national independence, and at present it is closely linked to the struggle to crush the ratification of the new "Security Treaty." We must urge the central and local joint struggle organizations to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" to pay attention to this large-scale march and actively arrange various activities. At the same time, we must also strive to organize joint struggle organizations in various regions to strive for the recovery of Okinawa.

"Akahata" called on all JCP members to strive for the victory of the large-scale march demanding the return of Okinawa in order to further strengthen the struggle to crush the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

    日共“赤旗报”发表社论指出
    日美“行政协定”使日本丧权辱国
    要求归还冲绳岛的大游行标志日本人民民族独立斗争的重要发展
    新华社24日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论强调说，日本民主团体所有的积极分子有必要研究新的日美“行政协定”，并且向人民揭露它的丧权辱国的性质。
    新“行政协定”是1月19日和新日美“安全条约”同时在华盛顿签订的。这项协定规定美军使用日本设施和地区的事项以及驻日美军的地位。
    社论促请大家注意新“行政协定”第二条和第二十三条。它说，“根据第二条，日本自卫队的基地可以由驻日美军使用。这将意味着，美国在日本的基地在一夜之间大大地扩大了”。
    社论说，“根据第二十三条，将以‘安全条约’和‘保密’为名，大大限制日本工人的合法权利。换句话说，新的‘行政协定’可以轻易地变成用来加强对工人的政治镇压和加紧经济剥削的非法工具。”
    社论说，“新的‘行政协定’一方面给予驻日美军以最大可能的特权，同时以保护美国基地和军事设施为名，作出详细规定，严格限制为（日本）宪法所保障的人民权利和日本主权。”
    社论促请大家注意这样的事实：总共有三十二个有关修改特别刑事法，特别民法和土地征用法等日本法律的法案，已经提请这次平时国会会议批准，以便实施新的“行政协定”。
    社论说，“如果国会批准这些目的在于镇压人民的法案使之成为法律，这将对人民的日常生活产生直接和间接的影响，结果使人民遭受数不尽的痛苦和困难。”
    社论最后说，在阻止国会批准和争取废除新“安全条约”的斗争过程中，必须揭露根据新“安全条约”签订的新“行政协定”所包含的实际危险，从而进一步推动反对新“安全条约”的斗争。
    新华社22日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，号召日共全体党员全力为争取要求归还冲绳岛的大游行的胜利而奋斗。
    社论指出，要求美国把冲绳岛归还日本的大游行自从1月24日从鹿儿岛出发以来，在全国工人和各界团体的全力支援下继续向东京前进。“赤旗报”谴责美国和岸信介政府不顾日本人民日益激烈的反对和抗议，仍然企图使国会强行批准新日美“安全条约”。
    社论指出，要求归还冲绳岛的大游行标志着日本人民争取民族独立斗争的重要的发展，在目前它同粉碎批准新“安全条约”的斗争有紧密的联系。我们要促使中央和各级阻止修改“安全条约”的共同斗争组织重视这次大游行，并且积极安排各种活动。同时还要努力在各地区组织为争取收回冲绳岛的共同斗争组织。
    “赤旗报”号召日共全体党员争取使要求归还冲绳岛的大游行取得胜利，以便进一步加强粉碎批准新“安全条约”的斗争。
