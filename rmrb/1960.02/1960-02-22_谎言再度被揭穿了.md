While the United States is baring its fangs and claws to intensify its planning for military intervention in Cuba, it has been wielding the big stick of "economic sanctions," threatening to reduce Cuba's sugar import quota in an attempt to force Cuba to submit. This threat became even more blatant after Cuba concluded a trade agreement with the Soviet Union. The U.S. Ambassador to Cuba and Eisenhower openly attacked this agreement, stating that the U.S. "might" revise the treaty for purchasing Cuban sugar. This completely exposes the lie of Eisenhower's statement on January 26th that the United States would not interfere in Cuba's internal affairs.

Cuba is a sovereign nation, and it has every right to conclude trade agreements with the Soviet Union; the United States has no right to interfere. However, the U.S. Ambassador to Cuba and Eisenhower arbitrarily launched malicious attacks on Cuba, questioning the price at which Cuba sells its sugar, how it uses the money, and how the Soviet Union handles the sugar. It is as if, because the United States signed a treaty to purchase sugar from Cuba, Cuba's economic life and diplomatic activities must completely follow the directions of the United States. Is this not blatant interference? Eisenhower complained that Cuba was selling sugar to the Soviet Union at world prices and "more on a barter basis," while at the same time boasting that the United States was importing Cuban sugar at prices higher than world prices and paying with "freely convertible currency." This is clearly an attempt to distort the truth and conceal the fundamental difference between the Soviet Union's sincere support for Cuba and the United States' exploitation of Cuba. However, on the contrary, it is precisely from this sharp contrast that people understand why the United States is so hostile to Cuba and why it is so furious about the Soviet-Cuban agreement.

The fact is that the United States, during the dark ages of military occupation of Cuba and then the use of dictatorial and traitorous regimes to maintain its control and plunder of Cuba, created a semi-colonial economy in which Cuba mainly produced and exported sugar, and was economically and commercially subordinate to the United States. The United States' annual import quota of half of Cuba's sugar, about three million tons, is based on the fact that U.S. sugar companies seized 17% of Cuba's national land, monopolized Cuba's sugar industry and sugar exports, enjoyed Cuba's preferential tariffs, and dumped surplus U.S. goods. What the United States gained in return for buying Cuban sugar at prices higher than world prices and paying in dollars was the loyalty of the Batista dictatorship, the staggering profits of over 260 million U.S. dollars (equivalent to five times the average capital) that eight U.S. sugar companies extracted in 21 years, forcing Cuba to generate a deficit of 950 million U.S. dollars in its international balance of payments from 1948 to 1958, and still nearly 100 million U.S. dollars last year. This is the dirty truth behind Eisenhower's so-called "preferential treatment" and "traditional friendship" towards Cuba.

As early as last November, Cuban Trade Minister Cepero Bonilla forcefully refuted such lies of so-called "preferential treatment," pointing out: "Cuba's sugar quota in the United States is not preferential treatment given to us by the United States, but the only compensation it (Cuba) receives from the many preferential tariff rights enjoyed by the United States (in Cuba). At the same time, this quota also guarantees the U.S. import market in Cuba." It can be seen that even if Eisenhower repeats the lie that has already been exposed thousands of times, he cannot conceal the essence of the United States' trade policy towards Cuba.

In contrast, the joint communiqué signed by Mikoyan during his recent visit to Cuba once again vividly demonstrated that the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are faithful friends of the national democratic movement. The Soviet Union not only agreed to purchase 425,000 tons of sugar from Cuba this year and 1 million tons of sugar annually for the next four years on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, but also provided a low-interest loan of 100 million U.S. dollars to help Cuba carry out industrial construction. Cuba sold sugar at world prices, exchanged it for machinery and materials, and received low-interest loans from the Soviet Union to develop its industry. This is incomparable to the United States' use of quotas and petty favors to monopolize Cuba's economy, forcing Cuba to endure the dumping of U.S. goods with low tariffs and pay huge deficits every year. The reason why Eisenhower launched a brutal attack is precisely because the Soviet-Cuban trade agreement has opened up new equal and mutually beneficial foreign trade relations for Cuba, which will help Cuba develop its industry and change its economic dependence.

The contrast is so stark, and black and white cannot be reversed. Prime Minister Castro pointed out that in nearly a decade of trade with the United States, Cuba suffered a trade deficit of 1 billion U.S. dollars with the United States, while the Soviet-Cuban trade agreement could give Cuba a surplus of 70 million U.S. dollars. Therefore, Cuban public opinion believes that the Soviet-Cuban trade agreement has opened up a new stage of economic development for Cuba, because the Cuban people have seen that they are not destined to submit to the enslavement of U.S. monopoly capital. Especially at present, when the United States is threatening Cuba with sugar import quotas, the Soviet-Cuban agreement is like "sending charcoal in snowy weather" to Cuba and a heavy blow to the interventionists. Therefore, as Radio Rebelde in Cuba pointed out, the Cuban people have understood who their true friends are and who their enemies are.

It is worth noting that the talks given by Eisenhower and Herter one after another show that the United States is still adopting a temporary so-called "attitude of restraint and patience" to coerce and lure Cuba. They hypocritically say that the United States is willing to "ensure that Cuba does not suffer harm" in order to achieve a solution and maintain "traditional economic relations." In fact, Eisenhower's statement on January 26th made it very clear that this is to prevent Cuba's land reform and construction from shaking the monopoly position of U.S. capital. Eisenhower euphemistically calls this shameful intervention "maintaining and protecting their (U.S.) legitimate interests." However, the "restraint" of the United States cannot conceal the dagger hidden under the gentleman's coat. Herter threatened at a press conference on the 18th that there could be "extreme actions that we would all naturally dislike to see happen." According to the "New York Times," the United States is now "clenching its fist."

The Cuban people are increasingly clearly aware from actual struggles that their just struggle can overcome any current difficulties with the friendship and support of all peace-loving people in the world, continuously consolidate the achievements of the revolution, and put the U.S. interventionists in an increasingly unfavorable position. Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, this is the nature of U.S. imperialism, but can't the Cuban people use clenched fists to deal with the United States' "clenched fists"?

    谎言再度被揭穿了
    凌明
    美国在张牙舞爪加紧策划对古巴的军事干涉的同时，一直挥舞“经济制裁”的大棒，扬言要削减古巴食糖的进口份额，企图迫使古巴屈服。古巴同苏联缔结贸易协定后，这一威胁更为露骨。美国驻古巴大使和艾森豪威尔公然先后攻击这个协定，表示美国“或许”要修改购买古巴食糖的条约。这就完全揭穿了艾森豪威尔在上月26日声明中所谓美国不干涉古巴内政的谎言了。
    古巴是一个主权国家，它完全有权同苏联缔结贸易协定，美国根本无权过问。但美国驻古巴大使和艾森豪威尔竟对古巴按什么价格出售食糖，怎样使用钱，以至苏联怎样处理食糖等等，都任意加以恶意攻击。仿佛由于美国同古巴签订了购买食糖的条约，古巴的经济生活和外交活动就必须完全听从美国的指点。这难道不是明摆着的干涉行为吗？艾森豪威尔抱怨古巴按照世界价格出售食糖给苏联，并“较多地建立在换货的基础上”，而同时吹嘘美国则按照高于世界价格的价格进口古巴食糖，所付的又是“可以自由兑换的货币”，这显然是企图颠倒黑白，掩饰苏联对古巴的真诚支持和美国对古巴的掠夺之间的根本不同性质。然而，恰恰相反，人们正是从这个截然对照中明白了美国为什么这样仇视古巴，又为什么对古苏协定这样暴跳如雷。
    事实是，美国在军事占领古巴，然后又利用独裁卖国政权保持它对古巴的控制和掠夺的黑暗年代中，造成了古巴主要出产和输出食糖，在经济上和贸易上从属于美国的半殖民地经济。美国每年进口古巴食糖的一半、约三百万吨的份额，是建立在美国糖业公司夺取了占古巴全国土地17％，垄断了古巴的糖业和糖的出口，并享受古巴的优惠关税，倾销美国剩余商品的基础上的。美国高于世界价格和付出美元购买古巴食糖所换来的，是巴蒂斯塔独裁统治的忠顺，美国八家糖业公司在二十一年中攫取了二亿六千多万美元（相当于平均资本的五倍）的惊人利润，迫使古巴从1948年到1958年在国际收支上产生了九亿五千万美元的逆差，直到去年还有近一亿美元的逆差。这就是艾森豪威尔所谓美国给予古巴的“优惠”和“传统友谊”背后的肮脏事实。
    古巴贸易部长塞佩罗·博尼利亚早在去年11月就有力地驳斥了这种所谓“优惠”之类的谎言，他指出：“古巴在美国的食糖份额并不是美国给我们的优待，而是它（古巴）从美国（在古巴）享有的许多优惠的关税权利方面所得到的唯一补偿。同时，这个份额也保证了美国在古巴的进口市场。”可见，即使艾森豪威尔把早已被揭穿的谎言重复几千遍，也掩盖不住美国对古巴的贸易政策的实质。
    与此相反，最近米高扬访问古巴时同古巴签订的联合公报，却又一次生动地证明了苏联和其他社会主义国家是民族民主运动的忠实朋友。苏联不仅在平等互利的基础上同意在今年购买古巴四十二万五千吨糖，并在往后四年中每年购买一百万吨糖，而且还低利贷款一亿美元帮助古巴进行工业建设。古巴按照世界价格出售了食糖，换回了机器和材料，又得到了苏联的低利贷款来发展工业，这同美国利用份额和小恩小惠，垄断古巴经济，使古巴以低关税忍受美国商品倾销，每年支付巨额逆差，是不可同日而语的。艾森豪威尔所以进行粗暴攻击，正是因为古苏贸易协定开辟了古巴新的平等互利的对外贸易关系，有助于古巴发展工业和改变它的经济依赖性。
    对照是如此鲜明，黑白是颠倒不了的。卡斯特罗总理指出，古巴在同美国近十年的贸易往来中，造成了古巴对美国的十亿美元的逆差，而古苏贸易协定可使古巴得到七千万美元的顺差。因此，古巴舆论界认为，古苏贸易协定打开了古巴经济发展的新阶段，因为古巴人民看到，他们并不是注定要屈从于美国垄断资本的奴役之下的。特别是在目前，美国正玩弄糖的进口份额威胁古巴的时候，古苏协定对古巴有如“雪中送炭”，对干涉者则是沉重的打击。因此正如古巴起义军电台指出的，古巴人民已经懂得谁是他们真正的朋友，谁是他们的敌人。
    值得注意的是，艾森豪威尔和赫脱先后发表的谈话，表明美国还在采取暂时的所谓“克制和耐心的态度”，对古巴进行威逼利诱。他们假惺惺地说什么美国愿意“使古巴不蒙受害处”来求得解决，以保持“传统的经济关系”，而实际上艾森豪威尔上月26日的声明已经说得很清楚，这就是要古巴的土改和建设不致动摇美国资本的垄断地位。艾森豪威尔把这种可耻的干涉，美其名曰“维护和保卫他们（美国）的合法利益”。但是，美国的“克制”并不能掩盖藏在绅士外衣里的匕首。赫脱18日在记者招待会上就威胁说，有可能发生“我们大家自然都极不喜欢会发生的那些极端行动”。按照“纽约时报”的说法，美国现在是在“紧握拳头”。
    古巴人民从实际斗争中越来越清楚地认识到，他们的正义斗争可以得到世界各国爱好和平的人民一切的友谊和支持来克服目前的任何困难，不断巩固革命的成果，使美国干涉者日益处于不利的地位。捣乱，失败，再捣乱，这是美帝国主义的本性，但是古巴人民难道就不会用紧握拳头来对付美国的“紧握拳头”？
