    Electrification of Scaffolding

    (Our report) The Lüda First Construction Engineering Company has manufactured an electric lifting scaffold, enabling the toolization and electrification of scaffolding.

    The Sixth Engineering Zone of this company successfully manufactured chain-cable scaffolding more than two months ago. However, it still had the drawback of requiring manual lifting and lowering. The workers of the Fourth Engineering Zone then developed a new method: changing the crossbeam of the chain-cable scaffolding to a metal tool-type hanger, and using a winch for lifting and lowering, enabling the toolization of the scaffolding and the electrification of lifting, thus completely eliminating the old-fashioned wooden scaffolding. This will save 70% of the scaffolding wood and greatly reduce the number of scaffolders needed.

    脚手架电动化
    本报讯　旅大第一建筑工程公司制成电动升降脚手架，使脚手架实现了工具化和电动化。
    这个公司第六工区在两个多月前制造成功了链索式脚手架。但它仍有需要人工起落的缺点。第四工区职工又研究出一种新方法：将链索脚手架的横担改为金属工具式吊架，并用卷扬机起落，使脚手架实现了工具化和升降电动化，因而彻底放倒了老式脚手架木。这样就能节约70％的脚手架木，大大减少架子工。
