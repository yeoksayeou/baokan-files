    Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, February 24th: During the Chilean Chamber of Deputies meeting on the 24th, Eisenhower's visit was condemned as running counter to the interests of the people of Latin American countries. Communist Deputy Jorge Montes read a statement by Communist Party General Secretary Luis Corvalán, which quoted a dispatch from U.S. journalist Joseph Newman, proving that the U.S. President's purpose in visiting was to strengthen U.S. imperialism's hegemony over these countries.

    On the 24th, "El Siglo" published a commentary on a dispatch from Washington by U.S. journalist Joseph Newman. Newman had reported in "El Mercurio" that "Latin America exchanging political support for economic aid will be the basis for reaching an agreement based on the interests of both parties." "El Siglo" pointed out that this means that as long as Latin America supports the United States in political actions against the Cuban revolutionary government, the U.S. moneybags will be open.

    Orlando Millas, a national leader of the Chilean Communist Party, published an article in "El Siglo" on the 24th, saying, "General Eisenhower will be an unwelcome guest." He said that whether in Chile or in other parts of Latin America, the vast majority of people breathe together with Cuba, and demand disarmament, effective peace, independence, land reform, and the recovery of resources seized by imperialism. Millas said, "We do not beg for American handouts, we do not run after investors' behinds. Investment is a means by which the United States carries out exploitation. We demand that we be allowed to live, work, and prosper on our own."

    Julio Benítez, second vice president of the Unified Workers' Confederation of Chile, published an article in "La Ultima Hora" on the 24th, saying: U.S. imperialism is the master of Chile's main resources, controlling large industries, banks, and trade consortia. Therefore, the working class living in misery and the peasants suffering from feudal exploitation cannot have any expectations for Eisenhower's visit. The union leader also said that Latin American workers believe that Eisenhower is a representative who carries out activities against the interests of workers.

    The leadership committee of the Unified Workers' Confederation of Santiago Province also issued a statement exposing Eisenhower's plot to visit South America. The statement said that Eisenhower's visit runs contrary to the feelings and opinions of the workers and people of Latin America.

    The statement said that the most fundamental purpose of this visit is to prepare to establish a political and economic blockade to prevent the development of the struggle for independence, freedom, and peace in Latin America. The statement said, calling on Santiago workers to actively mobilize and express effective class support for Cuban workers and the Cuban people.

    智利舆论反对美国拉拢南美国家孤立古巴的阴谋
    据新华社圣地亚哥24日电　在24日的智利众议院会议上，艾森豪威尔的访问被谴责为违背拉丁美洲各国人民的利益。共产党众议员豪尔赫·蒙特斯宣读了共产党总书记路易斯·科尔巴兰的声明，声明中引用美国记者约瑟夫·纽曼发出的电讯，证明美国总统访问的目的在于加强美帝国主义对这些国家的霸权。
    “世纪报”24日就美国记者约瑟夫·纽曼从华盛顿发出的电讯发表了评论。纽曼曾在“信使报”上报道说，“拉丁美洲以政治支持交换经济援助将是根据双方利益达成协议的基础。”“世纪报”指出，这就意味着，只要拉丁美洲在反对古巴革命政府的政治行动中支持美国，美国的钱袋就是敞开着的。
    智利共产党全国领导人奥尔兰多·米利亚斯在24日的“世纪报”上发表文章说，“艾森豪威尔将军将成为一个讨厌的客人。”他说，无论在智利还是在拉丁美洲其他地区，绝大多数人都同古巴共呼吸，都要求裁军、有效的和平、独立、土地改革和收回被帝国主义霸占的资源。米利亚斯说，“我们不乞求美国的施舍，我们不跟在投资者的屁股后面跑，投资是美国进行剥削的手段，我们要求让我们自己生活、工作和繁荣昌盛。”
    智利工人统一工会第二副主席胡利奥·贝尼特斯24日在“最后一点钟报”上发表文章说：美帝国主义是智利主要资源的主人，控制着大工业、银行和贸易财团，因此，过着悲惨生活的工人阶级和遭受封建剥削的农民，对艾森豪威尔的访问不能有任何期待，这位工会领导人还说，拉丁美洲工人认为，艾森豪威尔是进行反对工人利益活动的代表。
    智利圣地亚哥省工人统一工会领导委员会也发表声明，揭露艾森豪威尔访问南美的阴谋。声明说，艾森豪威尔访问是同拉丁美洲的劳动者和人民的感情和舆论相违背的。
    声明说，这次访问最根本的目的是准备建立一个政治和经济的封锁圈，阻止拉丁美洲争取独立、自由和和平斗争的发展。声明说，号召圣地亚哥工人积极动员起来，对古巴劳动者和古巴人民表示有效的阶级支援。
