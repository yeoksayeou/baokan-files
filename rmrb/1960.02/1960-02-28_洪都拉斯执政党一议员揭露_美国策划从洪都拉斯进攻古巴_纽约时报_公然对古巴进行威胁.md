Xinhua News Agency, February 27th: Latin American News Agency reported from Tegucigalpa on the 26th that Orellana Bueso, a congressman from the ruling Liberal Party of Honduras, revealed in parliament on the 26th that, "A plot to attack Cuba from Honduran territory is led by the (American) United Fruit Company."

Orellana said that foreigners such as Marcos Diaz Lanz, brother of former Cuban Air Force Commander Diaz Lanz, were being protected by the Honduran authorities and were preparing conspiracies in the northern region of Honduras. He said that Honduras' "airports in the north are being used to promote plans to invade Cuba." He accused the United Fruit Company of leading the execution of these plans.

Orellana also said that pilot Elias Aspen "undertook the obligation of transporting weapons from Guatemala to the United Fruit Company's activity center, Alleda la Lima." He said that pilot Aspen was employed by Minister of Economy Bueso. He strongly protested these activities.

Xinhua News Agency, February 24th: New York News: The "New York Times" used an editorial on Eisenhower's visit to South America to intimidate Cuba.

The newspaper published an editorial on the 21st saying, "The President is not visiting Cuba on his visit to Latin America. But the Cuban issue will play an important role in this visit." When talking about the U.S.'s relationship with Cuba having "fallen to an unprecedented low," the newspaper shamelessly attempted to shift the responsibility to Cuba, saying that Cuba's attitude towards the U.S. "is by no means friendly," while the U.S., which has repeatedly interfered in Cuba's internal affairs, has treated Cuba with "patience and restraint." The newspaper then threatened, "However, if relations with Cuba continue to deteriorate, people have serious doubts as to whether the United States can adhere to this policy."

    洪都拉斯执政党一议员揭露
    美国策划从洪都拉斯进攻古巴
    “纽约时报”公然对古巴进行威胁
    新华社27日讯　据拉丁美洲通讯社26日自特古西加尔巴报道，洪都拉斯执政党自由党议员奥雷利亚纳·布埃索26日在议会中揭露说，
  “一个从洪都拉斯领土上进攻古巴的阴谋是由（美国）联合果品公司领导的。”
  奥雷利亚纳说，诸如古巴前空军司令迪亚斯·兰斯的兄弟马科斯·迪亚斯·兰斯之流的外侨得到洪都拉斯当局的保护，在洪都拉斯北部地区准备阴谋活动。他说，洪都拉斯“北部的飞机场被用来推行入侵古巴的计划。”他指控联合果品公司领导执行这些计划。
    奥雷利亚纳还说，驾驶员埃利亚斯·阿斯本“承担了从危地马拉向联合果品公司的活动中心阿尔莱达拉利马运送武器的义务。”他说，驾驶员阿斯本是经济部长布埃索雇佣的。他强烈抗议这些活动。
    新华社24日讯　纽约消息：“纽约时报”在社论中借艾森豪威尔访问南美为题对古巴进行恫吓。
    这家报纸21日发表的一篇社论说，“总统在访问拉丁美洲时不访问古巴。但是古巴问题将在这次访问中起重要作用”。在谈到美国同古巴的关系已“降到空前低潮”时，这家报纸厚颜无耻地企图把责任推到古巴头上，说什么古巴对美国的态度“决不是友好的”，而一再干涉古巴内政的美国倒是对待古巴“采取了耐心和克制的态度”。这家报纸接着威胁说，“但是，如果同古巴的关系继续恶化，美国是否能固守这项政策，人们对于这一点深表怀疑”。
