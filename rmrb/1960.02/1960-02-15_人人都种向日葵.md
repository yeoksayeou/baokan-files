    Everyone Plants Sunflowers
    Editor's Note: Sunflowers have a wide range of adaptability and can be grown everywhere, whether in the south or north, sandy or saline-alkali soil, in front of houses or along field edges. The yield is no less than that of soybeans, and the oil yield is twice as high as that of soybeans. It should be planted in large quantities.
    Sunflower seeds can germinate at temperatures of three to five degrees Celsius, and the seedlings have strong resistance to spring cold and late frost, so they can be sown appropriately early. For most parts of China, the period from "Qingming" to "Lixia" is the sowing season.
    When arranging this year's oil production plans, all regions should not only plant on a large scale according to local conditions, but also fully mobilize the masses to launch a campaign where everyone uses the areas in front of and behind their houses and along the edges of fields to plant sunflowers on a large scale.

    Increasing Oil Production and Providing Pig Feed
    Editor:
    Recently, Qinyuan County, Shanxi Province, mainly involving 20,000 young people, created a "Sunflower Mountain" covering a total area of approximately 100,000 mu. This year, Qinyuan County decided to sell an additional 19.8 million jin of oil to the state.
    The people of Qinyuan County have prepared more than 218,000 jin of seeds for the "Sunflower Mountain," with an average of 223 dan of fertilizer per mu, and nearly half of the land has been deep-plowed to a depth of about seven inches.
    The "Sunflower Mountain" is the feed base for Qinyuan County's ten 10,000-pig farms. Currently, these pig farms have, according to their own capabilities, taken out a portion of their investment in advance to support the construction of the "Sunflower Mountain," and have signed contracts with the management unit of the "Sunflower Mountain" for the supply of feed. It is estimated that this "Sunflower Mountain" can produce 106 million jin of by-products such as sunflower seed heads and oil cakes, which can feed 160,000 pigs for a year. In this way, a large amount of vegetable oil is produced, and a large amount of feed is provided for pig raising, which is truly a win-win situation.
    I think Qinyuan County's method of building "Sunflower Mountains" is very good, and I hope that other regions can also adopt this or that method, according to their local characteristics, to expand the planting of sunflowers.

    Using Saline-Alkali Land to Plant More Sunflowers
    Editor:
    Sunflowers are an oil crop that can grow on saline-alkali land, and China has about 300 million mu of saline-alkali land, which is a good condition for planting a large number of sunflowers. According to my understanding, sunflowers planted on saline-alkali land in some areas yield about 250 jin of sunflower seeds per mu, which can extract 60 to 70 jin of oil. Someone has also calculated that if 20 million mu of saline-alkali or low-lying land is used to grow sunflowers, with an average yield of 200 jin of seeds per mu, the annual increase in vegetable oil would allow the national average to increase by 1.7 jin of edible oil per person. It can be seen that using saline-alkali land to plant sunflowers on a large scale is something that deserves great promotion.
    Sunflower heads and sunflower seed cakes after oil extraction are both good feed for pigs. In today's large-scale development of pig production, planting more sunflowers also has great significance.
    In addition, sunflowers are not only an edible oil with high nutritional value, but also can be used as industrial oil, with high economic value for export.
    Expanding the planting of sunflowers on saline-alkali land can be said to be making the most of the land. Therefore, I suggest that saline-alkali areas should plant as many sunflowers as possible when arranging planting plans this year.

    Uses of Sunflowers
    Sunflower seeds can be pressed for edible oil, and can be used in industry to make paint, leather, and soap; the outer shell of black sunflower seeds can be used as dye; oil cake and sunflower cake are good feed for livestock; the fiber in the stems can be used for spinning and papermaking; stems and seed shells can be used as fuel, and the ash from burning is a high-quality potash fertilizer.

### 人人都种向日葵

    人人都种向日葵
    编者按：向日葵生长的适应性很广，无论南方、北方，沙土地、盐碱地，屋前屋后、田边地角，到处可种，产量不低于大豆，而出油率比大豆高一倍。应当大量种植。
    向日葵种子在摄氏三到五度的气温下，就可以发芽，幼苗对春寒、晚霜的抵抗力较强，因此可以适当早播。就我国大部地区说，“清明”到“立夏”间，正是播种的季节。
    各地在安排今年的油料生产计划时，除因地制宜大面积种植外，还应当充分发动群众，掀起一个人人动手，利用屋前屋后、田边地角大种向日葵的运动。
    学习沁源大建葵花山
    既增添油料又提供猪饲料编辑同志：
    最近，山西沁源县以两万名青少年为主，搞了个“葵花山”，全部占地面积约十万亩。今年，沁源县决定多售给国家油料一千九百八十万斤。
    沁源县人民已经为“葵花山”准备好了种籽二十一万八千多斤，每亩地平均有肥料二百二十三担，有将近一半的土地深翻了七寸左右。
    “葵花山”是沁源县十个万头猪场的饲料基地。当前，这些猪场都根据自身的可能，事先拿出了一部分投资，支援“葵花山”的建设，并和“葵花山”的经营管理单位订立了供应饲料合同。预计，这座“葵花山”可产葵花盘、油饼等副产品一亿零六百万斤，可供十六万头猪一年食用。这样，既生产了大量的植物油，又为养猪提供了大量饲料，真是一举两得。
    我认为沁源县大建“葵花山”的办法很好，希望其他地区也能根据本地特点，采取这样或那样的办法，扩种向日葵。

    利用盐碱地　多种向日葵编辑同志：
    向日葵是一种能够在盐碱地上生长的油料作物，而我国有盐碱地三亿亩左右，这是大量种植向日葵的良好条件。据我了解，一些地区在盐碱地上种植的向日葵，每亩产葵籽二百五十斤左右，可榨油六、七十斤。有人还作过这样的计算：如果拿出二千万亩盐碱地或低洼地来种向日葵，平均每亩收籽二百斤，一年增产的植物油，全国平均每人可增加食油一点七市斤。可见利用盐碱地大种向日葵，是一件值得大大提倡的事情。
    向日葵的花盘和榨油以后的葵籽饼，都是喂猪的好饲料。在大量发展养猪生产的今天，多种向日葵也具有重大的意义。
    另外，向日葵不但是一种营养价值很高的食油，而且可作工业用油，出口的经济价值很高。
    在盐碱地上扩种向日葵，可谓是地尽其利。因此我建议，盐碱地区今年在安排种植计划时，尽量多种向日葵。

    向日葵的用途
    葵花子榨油可供食用，在工业上可用来制漆、制革和制肥皂；黑色葵花子的外壳，可作染料；油饼和葵花饼是家畜的好饲料；茎秆中的纤维可供纺织和造纸；茎秆和子壳能作燃料，烧出的灰是优质钾肥。
