Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 21st: Zhuang Xiquan, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China and member of the Reception and Settlement of Returned Overseas Chinese Committee, Huang Changshui and Zhuang Mingli, Deputy Directors of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and Wang Yuanxing, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, visited the Guangzhou Sanyuanli Returned Overseas Chinese Service Center on the morning of the 20th to warmly greet the returned Overseas Chinese from Indonesia.

Zhuang Xiquan and others first visited a dozen single elderly returned Overseas Chinese. Xu Qing, who had been deceived and sold as a miner for decades and is still unmarried, told the visitors about his miserable life as a miner overseas. Zhuang Xiquan and others comforted him, saying, "Everything will be better when you return to the motherland." Zhuang Xiquan and others also spoke with many returned Overseas Chinese miners, machinists, electricians, carpenters, drivers, and returned Overseas Chinese students. These returned Overseas Chinese are filling out job and school application forms. Zhuang Mingli told them: "The motherland has many mines and factories, and we welcome you to participate in construction." Some Overseas Chinese students who returned from Jambi knew Wang Yuanxing in the past when they were overseas. When Wang Yuanxing asked them about the living conditions of the Overseas Chinese in Jambi, Guo Wuye, a returned Overseas Chinese student, said: Many Overseas Chinese in Jambi are eager to return to the embrace of the motherland. Wang Yuanxing said: "The motherland warmly welcomes Overseas Chinese who are willing to return."

Returned Overseas Chinese expressed their infinite gratitude for the motherland's care and attention. Many Overseas Chinese born in Indonesia were particularly excited to return to the motherland for the first time. A returned Overseas Chinese student with the surname Wang from Surabaya told the reception staff after returning to the motherland: "This is the first time I have left my mother, but I have felt warmth I have never felt before. The motherland has prepared everything for me in life, and is more attentive than my mother." Wu Yuyu, a 21-year-old girl, was always happy and didn't know what to say when she talked to the reception staff. She was only one semester away from graduating from high school, but the anti-Chinese and discriminatory activities in Indonesia forced her family to return. She said: After returning to the motherland, she will serve the people well. Chen Yunli from Bangka, had taught in an Overseas Chinese primary school in a village in Indonesia for several years, but he lost his job due to the local government's restrictions on Overseas Chinese education. Now, he and his wife are returning to the motherland for the first time with their one-year-old child and simple luggage. On the Shenzhen Bridge, he tried his best to hold back his tears and excitedly told others afterwards: "I am happy to accept whatever work the People's Government assigns after returning, as long as I can participate in the construction of the motherland!"

Some elderly Overseas Chinese who "floated on the sea in their youth and returned with gray hair" are full of enthusiasm when they set foot on the land of the motherland. Chen Guangrong, 56, returned with his entire family of eight. He was sold overseas for seven silver dollars at the age of twenty-two to make a living and had been working as a tin miner on Bangka Island. He returned to his hometown in Guangdong once thirty years ago, and saw that it was difficult to make a living in the rural areas of old China, so he returned to his place of residence. This time, he was warmly received by relatives in the motherland, and saw new buildings everywhere and rapid progress in various construction projects, which touched him a lot. He said: The motherland is really good in every way. After hearing the reception staff's introduction to the motherland's construction, he was very interested in the grand vision of developing tropical crop resources on Hainan Island, and hoped to go to Hainan Island to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland.

    祖国欢迎你们回来参加建设
    庄希泉等在广州慰问印度尼西亚归国华侨
    据新华社广州21日电　中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会副主任、接待和安置归国华侨委员会委员庄希泉，华侨事务委员会副主任黄长水、庄明理，全国侨联副主席王源兴等，20日上午到广州三元里归国华侨服务所热情地慰问刚从印度尼西亚回国的华侨。
    庄希泉等首先去看望十几位单身的老年归侨。被骗卖出去当了几十年矿工、到现在还未娶妻的许青，向前来慰问的人倾诉他在海外当矿工的凄凉生活。庄希泉等安慰他说：“回到了祖国，一切就会好起来。”庄希泉等还同许多归侨矿工、机工、电工、木工、司机以及归国华侨学生谈了话。这些归侨正在填写求职、求学的表格。庄明理对他们说：“祖国有很多矿山、工厂、欢迎你们参加建设。”一些由巨港回来的华侨学生，过去在海外就认识王源兴，当王源兴向他们探问巨港华侨的生活情况时，归国华侨学生郭五叶说：巨港许多华侨都渴望回到祖国怀抱来。王源兴说：“祖国热烈欢迎愿意回国的华侨回来。”
    归国华侨对祖国的关怀和照顾表示无限的感激。许多在印度尼西亚出生的华侨，第一次回到祖国怀抱，感情格外激动。泗水一个姓王的归国华侨学生回到祖国后，对接待人员说：“我是第一次离开娘亲，但却感受到从未有过的温暖。祖国为我准备了生活上的一切，比母亲还要细心。”二十一岁的姑娘吴裕玉和接待人员交谈时，总是高高兴兴地不知道说什么才好。她只差一个学期就要在高中毕业了，但是印度尼西亚反华、排华活动迫使她合家回来。她表示：回到祖国后要好好为人民服务。来自邦加烈港的陈运利，曾经在印度尼西亚一个乡村的华侨小学里教过几年书，但在当地政府对华侨教育事业的层层限制下，他失业了。现在，他和妻子带着刚满周岁的孩子以及简单行李，第一次回到祖国。在深圳桥上，他极力忍住眼泪，事后激动地对别人说：“回来后随便人民政府分配什么工作都可以，只要能够参加祖国建设就高兴啦！”
    一些“青春浮海、皓首归来”的老华侨，踏上祖国的土地更是满怀热情。五十六岁的陈光荣全家八口都回来了。他是在二十二岁时以七元银元的代价被卖身到海外去谋生的，一直在汶岛当开采锡矿的工人。三十年前曾经回到广东故乡一次，看见旧中国的农村很难谋生，又返回侨居地。这次回来受到祖国亲人的热情接待，看见到处都是新楼房，各种建设事业突飞猛进，感触很多。他说：祖国真是样样都好。当他听到接待人员介绍祖国的建设情况后，他对海南岛开发热带作物资源的宏图美景很感兴趣，希望能到海南岛去参加祖国的社会主义建设。
