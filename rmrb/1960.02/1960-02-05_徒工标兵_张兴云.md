Zhang Xingyun is a female apprentice who joined the Xi'an State-owned Yellow River Machine Factory in early November 1958. Due to her hard work in learning technology and her high degree of conscientiousness and responsibility in her work, she completed four years and four months' worth of work last year, with no absences, no accidents, and no defective products throughout the year. She has become a Xi'an city apprentice pace-setter.

To learn and master technology, she arrives at the workshop one hour early every day to wipe down the machines and prepare tools. She leaves work later, striving to have more time to familiarize herself with the lathe. Peng Ce, a master worker in his fifties opposite her, happily encouraged her: "If you don't covet work, you can't become a good machinist." Zhang Xingyun, seeing that Peng Ce often arrived earlier than her, was even more motivated, thinking: "In terms of coveting work, I am still far from Master Peng." She secretly resolved to learn from Master Peng at all costs.

She studied lathe worker technology on her own. Because she only had an elementary school education, she faced many difficulties, but she studied hard and researched diligently, thinking about her lessons while walking and riding the bus, finally understanding it.

"Lathe work is easy to learn, but the tool is hard to sharpen." In order to break through the tool grinding barrier, Zhang Xingyun decided to learn the most difficult tool to grind. She picked up a pile of material heads and practiced before and after shifts, sharpening more than thirty in a row for twenty consecutive days, becoming the only apprentice in the workshop who could sharpen this kind of tool at the time.

Diligent study enabled Zhang Xingyun's technology to improve rapidly. At the end of February last year, she started working independently. At that time, although she didn't become complacent because of this, she couldn't help but feel a little proud. One day, Master Peng Ce was working on the same kind of job with another apprentice who had been in the factory for more than six months. He found that the apprentice's efficiency was high, so he happily went over and asked the apprentice what operating method he was using. That humble attitude of learning was even more earnest than when apprentices asked masters for advice. Zhang Xingyun, seeing this situation, remembered that she felt uncomfortable a few days ago when she asked an apprentice who had been in the factory for a shorter time than her a technical question. In comparison, she received a profound education.

From then on, Zhang Xingyun more consciously went to learn the ordinary but valuable qualities of the master workers. At the beginning of last year, she produced a batch of reworked products, wasting a day's work. She felt very sad. She thought: "Why can Zhou Huaxing, the factory's quality pace-setter, have no defective products or rework in a year and a half?" She went to Master Zhou's place several times and watched for a long time, but Master Zhou didn't notice her. His concentrated appearance was as if he wasn't standing in the workshop, but inside the parts. Once, Master Zhou was about to start making a very simple part. He studied the drawings repeatedly, and also wrote the process requirements of this part on the small blackboard above the lathe. After making the first product, he inspected it himself and sent it to the group leader and inspector for inspection. Zhang Xingyun used to think that simple parts didn't require so much effort, which resulted in a batch of screws being reworked. After Zhang Xingyun returned from asking Master Zhou for advice, she formulated various measures for herself and wrote down her determination in her notebook: "To be a worker who always produces good products, and every part we provide to the country is the best part." Last year, she processed 300,000 large, small, simple, and complex parts. Except for two batches that required rework, she did not produce a single defective product.

Zhang Xingyun is also an active technical innovator. She achieved twenty-three important technical innovation projects in one year. Once, the work section accepted a batch of urgent bushing tasks. The master workers could only do 150 pieces per day. After she researched, she could merge nine processes into five, and do 250 pieces per day. The foreman, group leader, and many master workers encouraged her and said to her: "Having ideas that surpass the master is what makes a good apprentice." As a result, she made 450 pieces in one day.

    徒工标兵—张兴云
    张兴云是在1958年11月初才进西安市国营黄河机器厂的一个女徒工。由于刻苦学习技术，对工作高度认真负责，她在去年一年作了四年零四个月的活，全年无缺勤，无事故，无废品，成了西安市的徒工标兵。
    她为了学习和掌握技术，每天提前一个小时到车间，擦机器，准备工具；下班以后晚些走，争取有更多的时间熟悉车床。她对面的五十多岁的老师傅彭策，高兴地鼓励她：“不贪恋工作，学不成个好机器匠。”张兴云因为看到彭策常比自己来得还早，干劲更大，心想：“要论贪恋工作，我距彭师傅还有很远呢。”她暗暗地下了狠劲，非学彭师傅不可。
    她自修车工工艺学，因为只有小学毕业程度有不少困难，但她苦钻苦研，走着路坐着车都想功课，终于把它学懂了。
    “车工好学刀难磨”。张兴云为了突破磨刀关，决定学一种最难磨的刀具。她拣了一堆料头，班前班后都练习，连续二十天磨了三十多把，成了当时车间里唯一会磨这种刀具的徒工。
    刻苦的学习使张兴云的技术进步很快。去年2月底，她开始独立工作了。当时，她虽然没有因此而自满起来，可总不由得有些得意。一天，老师傅彭策在和另一个进厂半年多的徒工同作一种活，发现徒工的效率高，他就非常高兴地过去问这个徒工用的什么操作方法。那种虚心学习的态度，比徒工们向师傅请教时还认真得多。张兴云看到这种情况，想起自己前些天因为向一个进厂时间比自己短的徒工问个技术问题，就感到不自在，相比之下，受到了一次深刻的教育。
    从这以后，张兴云更加自觉地去学习老师傅们的平凡而可贵的品质了。去年初，她出了一批返修品，浪费掉了一天的工时。她心里很难过。她想：“为什么全厂质量标兵周华兴能一年半无废品、无返修呢？”她好几次到周师傅那里看了很长时间，周师傅都没有注意到她。他那种聚精会神的样子，就像他不是站在车间里，而是站在零件里面。有一次，周师傅正要开始作一个很简单的零件。他翻来复去地研究图纸，还把这个零件的工艺要求写在车床上面的小黑板上；作出第一个产品以后，自己检验了又送给小组长、检验员去检验。张兴云过去就因为认为简单的零件不必费这么多事，结果使一批螺钉成了返修品。张兴云向周师傅请教回来，为自己订下了各种措施，并在笔记本上写下了自己的决心：“作一个永远生产好产品的工人，为国家拿出的每一个零件都是最好的零件。”去年她加工了大批、小批、简单、复杂的零件三十万个，除了有两批返修以外，没有出过一个废品。
    张兴云还是个积极的技术革新者。她在一年当中实现了二十三项重要的技术革新项目。有一次，工段接受了一批紧急的衬套任务，老师傅们每天只能干一百五十个，她研究以后可以合并九道工序为五道，每天能作二百五十个。工长、小组长和许多老师傅都鼓励她，并且对她说：“有超过师傅的思想，才是好徒工。”结果她一天作了四百五十个。
