    Powerful Factors Accelerating Agricultural Development

    In response to the call of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party to accelerate the development of agriculture, the Czechoslovak people are doing everything possible to promote increased agricultural production. From the two news items published in today's newspaper, we can see that this effort is producing significant results.

    In the Czechoslovak countryside, merging small agricultural cooperatives into large cooperatives can more rationally arrange manpower and materials, better utilize advanced agricultural technologies, and further leverage the superiority of socialist collective management.

    At the same time, the "High-Yield Hero" experimental field movement launched by farmers in the Slovak region has achieved remarkable results. The yields of many experimental fields are several times higher than those of ordinary fields. This proves that as long as the enthusiasm and creativity of the working people are fully utilized, the potential for increased production is inexhaustible. The "High-Yield Hero" movement demonstrates the heroic spirit of the Czechoslovak farmers.

    Undoubtedly, these two encouraging facts will become new and powerful factors in promoting the accelerated development of agricultural production in Czechoslovakia.

    加速农业发展的有力因素
    捷克斯洛伐克人民为了响应捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央关于加速发展农业的号召，正在千方百计地为促进农业增产而努力。从今天本报发表的两条消息中，我们看到这种努力正在产生巨大的效果。
    捷克斯洛伐克农村中把小的农业社合并为大社，就能够更加合理地安排人力物力，更好地利用农业先进技术，进一步发挥社会主义集体经营的优越性。
    与此同时，斯洛伐克地区农民开展的“高产英雄”试验田运动，已获得了显著的成绩。许多试验田的产量比普通田高出数倍。这证明，只要充分发挥劳动人民的积极性和创造性，增产的潜力是无穷尽的。“高产英雄”运动显示了捷克斯洛伐克农民的英雄气概。
    无疑地，这两件令人鼓舞的事实，将成为促进捷克斯洛伐克农业生产加速发展的新的有力因素。
