    Red Light Shines on Kladno
    By Lin Hai, Our Correspondent
    Kladno is where the late Czechoslovak President and outstanding working-class fighter, Zapotocky, lived and struggled for a long time, and it was also one of the centers of the Czechoslovak workers' movement in those years. Under the leadership of Zapotocky, the working class and the broad masses of working people in this region waged heroic and tenacious struggles to establish a genuine revolutionary workers' party and a socialist republic. Zapotocky left people a famous novel describing the history of the working-class struggle in Kladno based on his own experience, and the name of this novel is "Red Light Shines on Kladno."
    Kladno attracts us not only because of its glorious revolutionary tradition, but also because it is one of Czechoslovakia's coal and steel centers. The workers who bled and sacrificed for the revolutionary cause in the past, and who were unyielding, are today unfolding a new battle with heroic spirit on the road to building socialism.
    On January 20, it was the beginning of 1960. Although it was snowing heavily, we still set off for Kladno according to the scheduled itinerary. The car sped past snow-covered fields and forests. Soon, a cluster of towering factory buildings and chimneys appeared in front of us. The Kladno United Steel Works was in sight.
    A Brilliant and Arduous Journey
    Lu Uksha, Deputy General Manager of the Kladno United Steel Works, Party Committee Secretary F. Shlabalek, and Union Chairman M. Jonger warmly received us. The conversation began with the revolutionary struggles of the past. The current Kladno United Steel Works was then two separate steel factories, one called Polkina and the other called Konev. Most of the workers in these two steel factories actively participated in the struggle led by President Zapotocky. At that time, class struggle, national struggle, and intra-party struggle were all acute and complex, but the steel factory workers stood on the side of President Zapotocky's correct leadership. They made great contributions in the struggle against the domestic bourgeoisie and German fascism.
    After the Soviet army liberated Czechoslovakia, the German fascists were driven away, but the struggle did not stop. Even more arduous new tasks were placed before the working brothers. The Party Committee Secretary said that in the days immediately after liberation, the Kladno United Steel Works faced new difficulties. Because during the German fascist occupation, the Germans monopolized all production technology and management work. They exploited the working people of Czechoslovakia, but did not allow them to learn any knowledge of production management or technical operation. After the German invaders were driven away, the factories left behind had to be managed and operated by the workers themselves. At this time, the Party put forward the militant slogan: "Get the machines running!" This slogan expressed the will and aspirations of the working people, and the workers turned it into action. Soon, the workers of the Kladno United Steel Works realized this task. The Germans left, but production did not stop. Even in the early days of liberation, when fierce class struggle was still going on in the country, the factory's blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces never went out. The workers not only produced ordinary steel, but also produced high-quality steel and special steel.
    In the fifteen years since liberation, the production of the Kladno United Steel Works has been expanding and rising day by day. If the workers of the Kladno United Steel Works and the workers of other factories and mines in Kladno once won the title of "Red Kladno" in the past revolutionary struggles, then today's Kladno United Steel Works is still shining with red light in the construction cause. The workers here are still writing their own and their country's history in bright red colors.
    On the Road to Building Socialism
    After liberation, the Polkina Steel Plant and the Konev Steel Plant were merged, and it was decided to produce all high-quality steel. The tasks of reconstruction and expansion are increasing every year. Now this enterprise has four steel factories and eighteen rolling lines, seven of which are fully automated. We saw steel ingots put in from the lower end of the automatic line, and finished products were made at the other end of the automatic line. The comrades who led us on the tour told us that some parts of this automatic line had been modified by the factory's workers, which greatly improved production efficiency. There are few workers on the automatic rolling line, and the intensity of labor has also been greatly reduced.
    The production situation of the Kladno United Steel Works has been rising. Taking last year as an example, the annual production increased by 8.7% compared with 1958, and the production of steel, which is very important to the country, also completed 100% of the task. This year, the Kladno United Steel Works has undertaken even greater tasks. Their production plan for this year has increased by 10% compared with last year. In order to welcome the fifteenth anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia and victoriously complete the second five-year plan, the workers of the steel factory have devoted themselves to production with doubled enthusiasm since the beginning of the year. Deputy General Manager Uksha narrated the production guarantee for the first quarter with excitement. He said that 366 collectives and 151 individuals in the entire enterprise had proposed guarantees for the first quarter. According to these guarantees, the entire enterprise decided to produce 1,200 tons more steel, 860 tons more steel products, and 180 tons more rolled steel than originally planned in the first quarter, and the labor productivity will increase by 6.2%. He said that the production situation in the past twenty days has proved that our guarantee is completely achievable. In the first twenty days, steel completed 100% of the guarantee, and steel products completed 105% of the guarantee. He then talked about the effects of the implementation of industrial management reorganization, new planning and financial systems, and new wage systems. He said that since the Party and the government have taken these new measures in the industrial sector, the workers' enthusiasm for labor and sense of ownership have been greatly enhanced, and the workers have better exerted their energy and improved their skills, and strived to improve production.
    At the Kladno United Steel Works, 1960 is like the rising sun. Although it has only just emerged from the horizon, people have already seen that a brighter spring is coming.
    A Bustling Socialist Emulation
    Union Chairman Jonger told us about the socialist labor emulation widely launched by the workers. He said that especially since the implementation of the new planning methods, all plans have been thoroughly discussed by the workers of the entire enterprise. Every plan has been greatly improved after being discussed by the workers. The workers not only raised the planned targets, but also put forward guarantees to complete the tasks. At the same time, in the process of production, the workers often use their actual production achievements to once again refresh their already improved plans and guarantees. The competition between various departments of this enterprise is carried out very enthusiastically. The four steel factories are competing to be the best steel factory, and the eighteen rolling lines are competing to be the best rolling line. This kind of competition is evaluated once every quarter. The workers also launched competitions to reduce metal consumption and prevent accidents, and have achieved good results.
    Jonger also pointed out with satisfaction that the development of the competition for the title of "Socialist Labor Team" in particular has pushed the socialist emulation of the entire enterprise to a higher level. There are currently forty-five collectives in the entire enterprise participating in this competition. The workers can all understand the significance of this competition with a correct attitude. Therefore, they not only strive to improve production, but also strive to improve their political consciousness. The collectives that participate in the competition for this title have the best mutual cooperation and assistance. We met a collective that had won the title of "Socialist Labor Team". One of the veteran workers, Shahidel, who has been a party member for thirty-three years, said that as long as we work wholeheartedly for socialism, we can achieve anything. Another worker, who seemed to be not very old but has been a party member for eighteen years, said that every worker is striving to move forward, and we believe that we can complete and overfulfill the tasks of socialist construction. He said that we will use our actions to encourage the struggle of the working brothers in Western countries, and we will support the construction of fraternal countries with actions to complete orders. The workers of this advanced collective all asked us to convey their greetings to the Chinese people. They said that we are very concerned about the construction achievements of the Chinese people and respect the diligence and bravery of the Chinese people very much. When we were visiting the workshop, an old worker enthusiastically walked towards us and said: "Welcome you, let American imperialism see, we have hundreds of millions of people, the Soviet Union, China and Czechoslovakia will always stand together!"

    红光照耀着克拉德诺
    本报记者　林海
    克拉德诺是捷克斯洛伐克已故总统、工人阶级杰出战士萨波托斯基长期生活和斗争过的地方，也是捷克斯洛伐克当年工人运动的中心之一。这个地区的工人阶级和广大劳动人民在萨波托斯基的领导下，为建立一个真正的革命的工人政党和社会主义共和国进行了英勇顽强的斗争。萨波托斯基以他亲身的经历给人们留下了一部描写克拉德诺工人阶级斗争历史的著名小说，这部小说的名字就叫做“红光照耀着克拉德诺”。
    克拉德诺吸引着我们不仅因为它的光荣的革命传统，而且还因为它是捷克斯洛伐克的煤钢中心之一。当年为着革命事业而流血牺牲、坚强不屈的工人，今天又以英雄的气概在建设社会主义的大道上展开了新的战斗。
    1月20日，正是1960年的岁首，虽然大雪纷飞，但我们仍然按照预定日程向克拉德诺进发。汽车飞驰过白雪皑皑的田野和森林，不久以后，一片高耸的厂房和烟囱出现在前面，克拉德诺联合炼钢厂在望了。
    光辉而艰巨的历程
    克拉德诺联合炼钢厂的副总经理鲁·乌克沙，党委书记弗·什拉巴勒克和工会主席米·容格尔热情地接待了我们。谈话是从过去的革命斗争开始的。现在的克拉德诺联合炼钢厂在当时还是两个分开的钢铁工厂，一个叫波尔基纳，另一个叫柯涅夫。这两个钢铁工厂的绝大部分工人都积极参加了萨波托斯基总统所领导的斗争。当时阶级斗争、民族斗争和党内斗争都很尖锐复杂，但钢铁厂的工人都站在萨波托斯基总统的正确领导这一方面，他们在反对本国资产阶级和德国法西斯的斗争中，作出了巨大的贡献。
    苏军解放捷克斯洛伐克后，德国法西斯被赶跑了，但斗争并没有停止，在工人兄弟面前又摆上了更加艰巨的新任务。党委书记说，刚解放的那些日子里，克拉德诺联合炼钢厂面临了新的困难。因为在德国法西斯占领期间，德国人垄断了一切生产技术和管理工作，他们剥削捷克斯洛伐克的劳动人民，但是不让他们学习一点生产管理和技术操作的知识。而德国侵略者被赶跑后，留下的工厂必需由工人自己来管理和操作。这时党提出了战斗性的口号：把机器开动起来。这个口号表达了劳动人民的意志和愿望，工人们把它变成了行动。不久，克拉德诺联合炼钢厂的工人们就实现了这一任务。德国人走了，但生产并没有停下来，即使在解放初期，国内仍然在进行着激烈的阶级斗争的时期，工厂的工人一面积极参加了这一斗争，同时工厂的高炉和平炉也没熄灭过火焰。工人们不仅炼出了普通钢，而且还生产出了优质钢、特种钢。
    解放十五年来，克拉德诺联合炼钢厂的生产一天天在扩大、上升。如果说在过去革命斗争中，克拉德诺联合炼钢厂的工人们和克拉德诺其它工矿的工人一道，曾经获得了“红色的克拉德诺”的称号，那么今天的克拉德诺联合炼钢厂在建设事业中也仍然是红光照耀。这里的工人们仍然是用鲜红的颜色在书写自己的和祖国的历史。
    在建设社会主义的大道上
    解放后，波尔基纳钢铁厂和柯涅夫钢铁厂进行了合并，并且决定全部生产优质钢。改建和扩建的任务每年都在增加，现在这个企业有四个钢铁工厂、十八条轧钢线，其中有七条是完全自动化的。我们看到钢锭从自动线的下端放进去，在自动线的另一端就做出了成品。带领我们参观的同志告诉我们说，这种自动线的某些部分是经过工厂的工人们改造过的，大大提高了生产效率。在自动轧钢线上工人很少，劳动的强度也大大减轻了。
    克拉德诺联合炼钢厂的生产情况一直是上升的，就拿去年来说，全年的生产比1958年提高了8．7％，而对于国家十分重要的钢材生产也100％地完成了任务。今年，克拉德诺联合炼钢厂担负了更巨大的任务，他们今年的生产计划又比去年提高了10％。为迎接捷克斯洛伐克解放十五周年和胜利完成第二个五年计划，钢铁工厂的工人们从年初以来就以加倍的热情投入了生产。乌克沙副总经理带着兴奋的心情叙说了第一季度的生产保证。他说，全企业有三百六十六个集体和一百五十一个个人提出了在第一季度中的保证，全企业根据这些保证决定要在第一季度中比原计划多生产一千二百吨钢，八百六十吨钢材，一百八十吨压延钢，劳动生产率要提高6．2％。他说，过去了的二十天中的生产情况证明了我们的保证是完全可以完成的。在前二十天中，钢100％地完成了保证，钢材完成了保证的105％。他接着谈到工业管理改组、新的计划和财务制度以及新的工资制度在实施中所获得的效果。他说，自从党和政府在工业部门采取这些新措施以来，工人们的劳动热情和主人翁感大大提高，工人们更好地发挥了干劲和提高了技术，为提高生产而努力。
    在克拉德诺联合炼钢厂，1960年像初升的太阳一样，虽然还只是刚露出地平线，但人们已经看到，一个更加明朗的春天快要来临了。
    热火朝天的社会主义竞赛
    工会主席容格尔向我们谈到了工人们广泛展开的社会主义劳动竞赛，他说，特别是实行新的计划方法以来，所有的计划都经过了全企业工人的详尽讨论，每一项计划在经过工人讨论后，都被大大提高了，工人们不仅提高了计划指标，而且提出了完成任务的保证，同时往往在生产的过程中，工人们又以自己实际的生产成就，再一次刷新他们已经提高了的计划和保证。这个企业各部门之间的竞赛开展得很热烈，四个钢铁厂之间开展着争取作最好的钢铁厂的竞赛，十八条轧钢线开展着争取作最好的轧钢线的竞赛。这种竞赛每季度评选一次。工人们还展开了降低金属使用量和防止事故发生的竞赛，都获得了很好的效果。
    容格尔还满意地指出，特别是争取“社会主义劳动队”称号竞赛的开展，把全企业的社会主义竞赛推向到一个更高的水平。全企业现有四十五个集体参加这一竞赛，工人们都能以正确的态度理解这一竞赛的意义，因此他们不仅努力提高生产，也努力提高自己的政治觉悟。凡是参加争取这一称号竞赛的集体，相互的协作和帮助都是作得最好的。我们会见了一个获得“社会主义劳动队”称号的集体。其中一个有三十三年党龄的老工人沙亦得尔说，只要全心全意为社会主义工作，我们什么都能作得到。而另外一个看来年龄不大，但是已有十八年党龄的工人说，我们每个工人都在努力前进，我们相信我们可以完成和提前完成社会主义建设的任务。他说，我们要以自己的行动来鼓励西方国家的工人兄弟的斗争，要以完成订货的行动支援兄弟国家的建设。这个先进集体的工人们都要求我们转达他们对中国人民的致意，他们说，我们很关心中国人民的建设成就，很尊重中国人民的勤劳勇敢。而当我们在车间参观时，一个老工人热情地走向我们说：“欢迎你们，让美帝国主义看看吧，我们有几亿人民，苏联、中国和捷克斯洛伐克是永远站在一起的！”
