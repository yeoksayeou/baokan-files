	Prepare Sufficient Good Seeds to Greet Spring Plowing

	The spring sowing season is fast approaching, and the vast land is waiting for people to sow new seeds of harvest. Farmers often say: "Good seeds produce good seedlings, and good varieties increase production." In order to welcome spring sowing, all regions, people's communes, and production teams should quickly seize the seed preparation work and prepare sufficient good seeds for spring sowing.
	In the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, "seed" ranks fourth. Using improved varieties is one of the important conditions for realizing increased agricultural production. If the work of promoting improved varieties closely follows the continuous strengthening of soil, fertilizer, and water and other production increase measures, and if various measures closely cooperate and complement each other, the production increase effect will be even greater; if the seed work cannot keep up, it will offset the effect of other production increase measures to a certain extent. In the past two years, especially since the people's commune system was established, our country has made great achievements in promoting improved varieties in various regions. In many areas, the planting area of ​​improved varieties of some crops has accounted for 70% to 80% of the total planting area; in some areas, improved varieties of major crops have been basically popularized. However, one should not be complacent about this. There is still much work to be done in promoting improved varieties. In most areas, the area for promoting improved varieties only accounts for a part. Now it is necessary to prepare more improved varieties and further promote them on a larger scale. Even in areas with a large area for promoting improved varieties, there may still be problems of one kind or another: for example, some improved varieties have begun to degenerate, and some new improved varieties must be used; for example, although they are excellent varieties, the quality of the seeds varies to a certain extent, which affects the emergence of seedlings, and so on. These problems should be solved before sowing according to the spirit of striving for perfection. The selected seeds should also be subjected to quality inspection and germination tests, so that you can be confident when sowing.
	The current emphasis on grasping seed work is also due to the following two situations: First, many areas suffered from a major drought last year that had not been seen in decades, and the varieties of seeds left may not be complete, and the quality may not be very good; second, all regions are generally preparing to expand the planting area this year, and the seeds selected and retained last year are not enough, so a portion of seeds must be added. All regions and people's communes should comprehensively calculate the detailed account of seeds according to this year's planting area to see how much seeds are needed, how much is still lacking now, and how much they can solve by themselves, and then find ways to adjust. In terms of adjusting seeds, all regions, communes, and within communes should promote the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation, and exchange what they have for what they need; especially for disaster areas, they should promote the communist spirit and give priority to helping them solve the difficulties of insufficient seeds.
	Seed work is a very meticulous work. From seed selection, exchange, storage, quality inspection to pre-sowing treatment, there should be professional organizations and personnel responsible to the end. All communes and production teams can establish specialized teams and groups responsible for sowing according to the needs of this work.

    备足良种迎春耕
    程浦
    春播季节快要到了，广阔的大地正在等待人们撒下新的丰收的种子。农民常说：“好种出好苗，良种增产高。”为了迎接春播，各个地区、各个人民公社和生产队应该赶快把种子的准备工作抓起来，为春播准备好足够的良种。
    农业“八字宪法”中，“种”字占了第四位。使用良种是实现农业增产的重要条件之一。在土、肥、水等项增产措施不断加强的情况下，如果推广良种的工作再紧紧跟上，做到各项措施密切配合，相得益彰，增产效果就会更大；如果种子工作跟不上，就会在一定程度上抵销其他增产措施的作用。近两年来，特别是人民公社化以来，我国各地推广良种的工作有了很大的成绩。在不少地区，部分作物的良种种植面积已占总播种面积的十分之七、八；有些地区，主要作物的良种已经基本普及。但是，不能因此自满，在推广良种方面还有很多工作要作。在大多数地区，良种推广的面积还只占一部分，现在需要准备更多的良种，在更大的范围内进一步推广。就是良种推广面积较大的地区，仍然可能有这样或那样的问题：比如某些良种开始发生退化现象，必须改用一部分新的良种；比如虽是优良品种，但种子的质量存在着一定程度的参差不齐，影响出苗情况，等等。这些问题都要根据精益求精的精神，在播种之前，加以解决。选好了的种子还应该进行质量检验和发芽试验，这样，播种的时候，才能心中有数。
    当前强调抓种子工作，还因为有以下两个情况：一是去年不少地区遭受了几十年来未有的大旱，留下的种子的品种可能不齐全，质量也不一定很好；二是今年各地普遍准备扩大播种面积，光靠去年选留的种子不够用了，必须增加一部分种子。各个地区、各个人民公社应该根据今年播种面积，全面地算一算种子的细账，看看种子到底需要多少，现在还缺多少，自己能解决多少，然后再想办法调剂。在调剂种子方面，各个地区之间、公社之间和公社内部，都应该发扬互助协作精神，互通有无；特别是对于灾区，更应该发扬共产主义的精神，优先帮助他们解决种子不足的困难。
    种子工作是一项很细致的工作，从种子精选、调换、保管、验质到播前处理，需要有专业组织和人员负责到底。各个公社和生产队可以根据这项工作的需要，建立负责播种工作的专业队和专业组。
