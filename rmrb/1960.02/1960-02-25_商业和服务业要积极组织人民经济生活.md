    Under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, relying on enterprises, schools, government offices, and the masses of residents, rationally allocating commodities, extensively organizing mass service undertakings, and actively assisting collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, commerce and service industries should do everything possible to actively organize the economic life of the people in industrial and mining areas and urban streets. This is the inevitable product of the Great Leap Forward. It is gradually developed to adapt to the new situation of the Great Leap Forward and to meet the urgent demands of the broad masses. Since the Great Leap Forward, with the rapid development of industrial production and street production undertakings, most of the idle labor force and housewives among urban residents have been employed, and social purchasing power has increased rapidly. In this way, the urban people not only demand a more organized and more reasonable supply of non-staple foods and daily necessities; but also demand further development of various life service undertakings and collective welfare undertakings, and gradually realize the collectivization of life and the socialization of housework, so as to arrange life better, mobilize all positive factors, and concentrate on production. Commerce and service industries organizing people's economic life reflects the requirements of this new situation.
    The fact that commercial and service industries organize people's economic life is a new development of commerce and service industries. It fully demonstrates the superiority of the socialist system and is a concrete manifestation of implementing the political viewpoint, production viewpoint, and mass viewpoint in commerce and service industries. The basic task of socialist commerce and service industries is to serve production and consumers. In order to accomplish such a task, it is important to actively participate in production, organize production, and promote production, providing industrial and agricultural production departments with more means of production, and actively expanding the purchase of industrial and agricultural products; at the same time, organizing people's economic life, arranging the various links of exchange, distribution, and consumption, and arranging the lives of the masses well are equally important tasks, which in themselves are serving production. We often talk about convenience for customers. Who are the customers? Mainly the working people. If we help every working person arrange their economic life well, run public canteens, nurseries, and other collective welfare undertakings well, so that the working people can participate in production without any worries, feel happy, and have soaring enthusiasm, is this not serving production?
    Of course, the significance of organizing people's economic life is not limited to this. Practice has proved that after the lives of the masses are organized, not only can more labor be liberated, but also the broad masses of residents have more time to study culture and politics, which is conducive to cultivating the communist ideology of serving the collective wholeheartedly. It not only allows the masses to eat well, dress well, and drink well, but also further promotes production development, raises the consciousness of the masses, changes people's mental outlook, and cultivates people's communist ideology.
    It is a glorious and arduous task for commercial and service industry departments to actively participate in organizing people's economic life. We must strengthen the leadership of the Party, strengthen the communist sense of responsibility of all employees, resolutely implement the mass line, and take on this task. Some people say that organizing people's economic life is "meddling in other people's business" and "overstepping one's bounds." These statements are incorrect. For our socialist commerce and service industries, anything that is beneficial to production and laborers, and beneficial to socialist construction and the transition from socialism to communism, is not "other people's business," nor is there a question of overstepping one's bounds. As long as we need to do it, we will work hard to do it, and we must do it well.
    It must be pointed out that the active participation of commercial and service industry departments in organizing people's economic life has become a regular and major task, and it is another development of work. We should support it with full enthusiasm and cultivate it like any new thing. Only in this way can it bloom beautiful flowers and bear abundant fruits!

### 商业和服务业要积极组织人民经济生活

    商业和服务业要积极组织人民经济生活
    商业和服务业在党委统一领导下，依靠企业、学校、机关和居民群众，合理分配商品，广泛组织群众性的服务事业，积极协助公共食堂等集体福利事业，千方百计地积极组织工矿区和城市街道人民的经济生活，这是大跃进的必然产物。它是适应大跃进的新形势，适应广大群众的迫切要求而逐步发展起来的。大跃进以来，随着工业生产和街道生产事业的迅速发展，城市居民中间的闲散劳动力和家庭妇女大部就业，社会购买力提高得很快。这样城市人民就不但要求更有组织、更加合理地供应副食品和日常生活用品；而且要求进一步发展各项生活服务事业和集体福利事业，逐步实现生活集体化和家务劳动社会化，以便把生活安排得更好，调动一切积极因素，集中精力从事生产。商业和服务业组织人民经济生活，就是反映了这种新的形势的要求。
    商业和服务业部门组织人民经济生活，这是商业和服务业的新发展，它充分地显示了社会主义制度的优越性，是在商业和服务业中贯彻政治观点、生产观点和群众观点的具体表现。社会主义商业和服务业的基本任务是为生产为消费者服务。为了完成这样一个任务，积极参与生产、组织生产、促进生产，为工农业生产部门提供更多的生产资料，积极扩大收购工农业产品，固属重要；同时组织人民经济生活，把交换、分配、消费的各个环节安排好，把群众生活安排好，同样是重要的工作，这本身就是为生产服务。我们经常讲方便顾客，顾客是谁呢？主要的是劳动人民。如果我们帮助每一个劳动人民把经济生活安排好，办好公共食堂和托儿所等各项集体福利事业，使劳动人民参加生产无后顾之忧，心情舒畅，干劲冲天，难道这不是为生产服务了吗？
    当然，组织人民经济生活的意义并不限于此。实践证明，群众生活组织起来以后，不但可以解放更多的劳动力，而且使广大居民有更多的时间学习文化，学习政治，有利于培养一切为了集体的共产主义思想。它不仅让群众吃好、穿好、喝好，而且会进一步促进生产发展，提高群众觉悟，改变人们的精神面貌，培养人们的共产主义思想。
    商业和服务业部门积极参予组织人民经济生活，是一个光荣而艰巨的任务。我们必须加强党的领导，加强全体职工的共产主义的事业责任感，坚决贯彻群众路线，把这个任务承担起来。有人说：组织人民经济生活是“多管闲事”、“揽得宽”了。这些说法是不对的。对于我们社会主义商业、服务业来说，凡是对生产对劳动者有利的事情，对社会主义建设和从社会主义过渡到共产主义有利的事情，就没有什么“闲事”，也没有宽不宽的问题，只要需要我们做，我们就努力地做，而且一定要做好。
    必须指出，商业和服务业部门积极参予组织人民经济生活，已成为经常的重大任务，是工作的又一发展，我们应该像对待任何新生事物一样，满腔热情地支持它，培植它，只有这样才能使它开放瑰丽之花，结成丰硕之果！
