Several Questions on the History of the Hui People
Bai Shouyi

Editor's Note: Our country is a multi-ethnic country, and studying the history of minority ethnic groups is of great significance. This article raises several questions worthy of discussion in the history of the Hui people. We publish it for readers' reference.

The Hui People and Islam

The relationship between the Hui people and Islam is the first question encountered in the history of the Hui people.

Due to the long-standing influence of the past, some people still equate the Hui people with Islam. This is clearly not in accordance with the facts.

In the seventh century AD, Islam was founded in Arabia. Over the past ten centuries, many ethnic groups in West Asia, North Africa, and Southeast Asia have accepted the faith of this religion. However, the Hui people have not emerged in these regions as a result of this. At the same time, among these ethnic groups that believe in Islam, it cannot be said that everyone has this religious belief without exception.

Islam was introduced to the Chinese people shortly after its founding through Persian and Arab merchants. Throughout the Tang, Five Dynasties, and Song dynasties, China did not see the emergence of the Hui people due to the introduction of this religion and the residence of Persian and Arab Muslims (people who believe in Islam). The Hui people began to form during the Yuan Dynasty. The "Huihui" at this time can be mostly believed to be Muslims, but not all Huihui were Muslims. For example, Ai Xue and his son Lu He, from the Huihui family of medicine scholars during the Yuan Dynasty, successively managed the Guanghui Si (an institution for preparing Huihui medicines). The "History of Yuan," "Emperor Shizu's Annals" (tenth year of Zhiyuan) also clearly states that Ai Xue was a Huihui, but Ai Xue's religious belief was not necessarily Islam, but may have been Christianity. Subsequently, in the formation and development of the Hui people, Islam also developed among the Huihui, but Huihui who did not believe in Islam still existed. Moreover, after the Yuan Dynasty, the Uyghur, Kazakh, Dongxiang, Kyrgyz, Salar, Uzbek, Tajik, Tatar, and Bonan ethnic groups successively became ethnic groups with Islamic beliefs, so the ethnic groups in China who believe in this religion are not limited to the Hui people.

A Muslim may be a Hui person, but may also be a person of another ethnic group. A Huihui is very likely a Muslim, but is not necessarily a Muslim. The Hui people, as an ethnic group, have their own living conditions, economic conditions, common language, and common psychology. Without these, the Hui people cannot be manifested as an ethnic group. Islamic belief is only a form of social consciousness of the Hui people under certain historical conditions. The Hui people cannot be manifested as an ethnic group from the perspective of religious belief. Islamic belief, as a characteristic of the Hui people's ideology, is also not the same in every region. In areas where the Hui and Han live together, this is a characteristic. In areas where the Hui and Uyghur live together, this is not a characteristic, and the difference in language becomes the characteristic of the ethnic group.

In distinguishing between the Hui people and Islam, we do not ignore the connection between the Hui people and Islam. Islam is a religion with a long historical relationship with the Hui people. Certain common ethnic customs, such as diet, marriage, and funerals, are historically related to Islam. Before the birth of the Chinese Communist Party and before the Hui people obtained the correct path to liberation, Islam was once used as a tool to call for and organize anti-oppression struggles. On the other hand, Islam has been used by feudal dynasties as a tool to rule the Hui masses since the Yuan Dynasty, appearing successively in the form of "Huihui Da Shi Ha Di Suo" (an institution that judges cases according to religious law), "Imperial-Bestowed Mosques," and using Ahong to act as village elders. The development of Islam among the Hui people after the mid-Ming Dynasty was actually the result of the increasingly developed class division within the Hui people. The Menhuan system (a hereditary system of religious leaders and landlords) in Gansu reflects the development of the local monastery landlord economy, the Jingtang education in Shaanxi and Shandong reflects the development of the local small and medium landlord economy, and the emergence of Chinese translations of religious books in Nanjing and Suzhou is also related to the development of local handicraft and commercial economies. Although Islam has also been used as a tool to call for and organize anti-oppression struggles, it often only points to the "fantasy requirements" of the "other shore of truth," only points to dying for religion, and cannot lead the struggle to the "truth of the human world," pointing out the correct direction of realistic struggles. Moreover, Islam, like some religions, appears in the form of preaching to all "humanity," which only conceals class contradictions under the name of "humanity," making it easier for the exploiting classes to use it as a tool to deceive the exploited classes. Ethnic customs related to religion have historically shown their changes or differences in different periods and different regions, and there have been many changes in recent years, and they are still changing. Specific ethnic customs are not immutable.

The complex relationship between the Hui people and Islam also shows some of the objective reasons for confusing the two. However, no matter how complex the relationship between the two is, there are ultimately insurmountable boundaries. Mistakenly conflating the two is not only inconsistent with the facts, but also has great harm in real life. In the situation of continuous revolution and continuous leaps forward, the Hui people are constantly developing. This development is the development of the Hui people in political life, economic life, and cultural life, and cannot be measured by whether or not religion develops. If religion and ethnicity are confused, or the role of religion is emphasized, then it will bind the hands and feet of the Hui people in striving for progress in the national family, which is contrary to the Party's general line.

The Origin of the Hui People

The origin of the Hui people is a more controversial issue. One view is that the Hui people originated from the Uyghurs of the Tang Dynasty. The second view is that the Huihui who came east from Central Asia, Persia, and Arabia during the Yuan Dynasty were the main source of the Hui people. The third view is that the Hui people were mainly led by the original Turkic people, and mixed with Persians, Afghans, Arabs, and others who came east. Recently, there has been another view that the Han Chinese are the main source of the Hui people.

From the perspective of literature, during the Youyou years (1086-1093) of the Song Dynasty, Shen Kuo's "Dream Pool Essays" recorded the victory songs of the border soldiers in the Northwest, and began to propose the term "Huihui." The "Huihui" he referred to were the Uyghurs (now Uyghurs) who lived in the Anxi area at that time, which is obviously different from the "Huihui" we are talking about now.

In Xu Ting's "Black Tatar Affairs Summary," written in the first year of Jiaxi (1237) of the Song Dynasty, there are several mentions of "Huihui," including "Huihui Country" (Khwarazm), Kangli (Kangli in the north of the Aral Sea), and Kebishao (Kipchak, on the north bank of the Black Sea). The "Huihui" he referred to as "Huihui characters" again refers to the Uyghurs. This is also obviously different from the "Huihui" we are talking about now.

In Yuan Dynasty records, the term "Huihui" appeared in large numbers, and its meaning was also clarified. This shows that Huihui occupied a considerable position in the political and social life at that time. In Tao Zongyi's "Nancun Farming Records," Huihui is separated from ethnic groups such as Kipchak, Kangli, and Tangut. In official documents, Huihui is separated from Han Chinese and Uyghurs. In the "Household" section of Volume 3 of the "Zhi Shun Zhenjiang Chronicle," there are records of 29 Mongol households, 14 Uyghur households, 59 Huihui households, and 23 Yelikewen households. This shows that the Yuan Dynasty household registration also made a clear distinction between Huihui and Uyghurs.

Yuan Dynasty literati liked to use ancient and elegant names and used old names, so that the terms Huihui, Huihe, and Uyghur were mixed up. But even so, they could still distinguish between Huihui and Uyghur. Wang Yun said in Volume 95 of "Complete Works of Mr. Qiujian": "Uyghur is now Waiwu, Huihe is now Huihui." Note: "Uyghur" and "Huihe" are different translations of the same word and should not be separated into two; "Huihe" and "Huihui" should not be combined into one. However, Wang Yun was very clear about the difference between Waiwu (Uyghur) and Huihui, he just made a mistake in the evolution of ancient and modern terms.

In the works of the Ming people, there was a situation in which Huihui and Uyghurs were mixed together. However, in the records familiar with Xinjiang, there is a clear distinction between the two. For example, Volume 12 of "Records of the Various Regions" records that there are three types of people in Hami, "One type, Huihui, one type, Uyghur, one type, Halahui." The difference here is very clear.

In some works of the Qing people, the situation of taking Islam as the only symbol of ethnicity began to appear. They mixed up Huihui and Uyghurs and called them "Hui," and called Huihui "Han Hui" and "Shu Hui," and Uyghurs "Chan Hui" and "Sheng Hui." Although their language contained a sense of ethnic discrimination, they still had to admit the difference between the two. Moreover, in the Qing Dynasty, the Hui people only used the names from the Yuan and Ming dynasties, calling themselves Huihui, while the Uyghurs never called themselves "Hui."

From the specific content represented by the term "Huihui," which has been habitually used since the Yuan Dynasty, "Huihui" is today's Hui people, not the Uyghur people. Therefore, "Huihe" or "Uyghur," which is synonymous with "Uyghur," cannot be confused with the Hui people. The view that the Hui people originated from the Uyghurs of the Tang Dynasty is not in accordance with historical facts from the records we have seen.

The Huihui mentioned in the records of the Yuan Dynasty generally refer to people from Central Asia, Persia, and Arabia. These people migrated east due to the Mongol nobles' westward expedition, including craftsmen, soldiers, merchants, scholars, and nobles. The Huihui people's names and related records in the Yuan Dynasty can illustrate this point. The so-called "Western Regions Huihui" legend popular among the Hui people can also be confirmed with historical records.

These Huihui who came east are the main source of the later formation of the Hui people. The origin of the Hui people also includes members of indigenous ethnic groups in China and Persians and Arabs who have lived in China for a long time since the Tang and Song dynasties.

Originally, the upper-level figures among the Huihui who came east during the Yuan Dynasty had brought their families. However, in general, due to the difficulties of transportation conditions and wartime conditions at that time, the eastern migration of Huihui should mainly consist of men. In this case, since the Huihui were to live in China, they inevitably had to marry indigenous women. Because it was a male-centered society, these women who married Huihui became part of the origin of the Hui people. Because there are more places where the Hui and Han live together, the Han and Hui married more than people of other ethnic groups. Someone has done research and found some examples of Han women marrying Hui men in Yuan Dynasty documents. Of course, the examples that have existed in history are far more than the records in the documents.

In addition to Han Chinese, Mongols, Uyghurs, etc. are also sources of the Hui people. The reasons why they became part of the Hui people are, in addition to marriage, some are due to political reasons, and some are due to economic or religious reasons. They not only became part of the source of the Hui people in the Yuan Dynasty, but also continued to join the Hui people later. On the other hand, while the Hui people continue to absorb the components of other ethnic groups, some people have also changed from the Hui people to other ethnic groups.

Of course, the status of Han Chinese in the composition of the Hui people is quite important. However, it is not necessarily appropriate to regard Han Chinese as the main source of the Hui people. Because, since the Hui people mainly developed in the situation of living together with the Han Chinese, it is not reasonable to say that the Han Chinese separated from their own ethnic group under such circumstances and became the main force in forming the Hui people.

The origin of the Hui people may also include Turkic people, that is, Turkish people. This may have come to China during the Yuan Dynasty as part of the Central Asians. However, if it is said that the main source of the Hui people is the Turkic people who originally lived in China and its neighboring areas, then there is no trace to be found. Someone cited Xu Ke's "Qing Dynasty Anecdotes," "The Hui ethnic group is also called the Turkish ethnic group, originating from the Turkic," as evidence. In fact, "Qing Dynasty Anecdotes" is a miscellaneous compilation of recent people, and it cannot be used as the basis for arguing about historical events hundreds of years ago. This is unnecessary to explain. Moreover, the "Hui" mentioned in this book is also different from the "Hui ethnic group" we are talking about.

Bourgeois rightists once attempted to use the issue of the origin of the Hui people to clamor that "China is not the motherland of the Huihui." This nonsense is not worth refuting. First, the dispersal, integration, and migration of ethnic groups are not uncommon in world history. For members of ethnic groups after migration, their motherland is not the old residential area that has no connection with distant and real life, but the current country that they and their ancestors actually participated in creating. Since some Arabs and Greeks have formed the modern Italian nation together with Romans, Germans, and Etruscans, Arabia and Greece are not their motherlands, but Italy is their motherland. Since some English people moved from England to the Americas and formed the American nation, England is no longer their motherland, but the United States has become their motherland. Similarly, since Central Asians, Persians, Arabs, and others who came east have formed the Hui ethnic group in China together with members of fraternal ethnic groups, which has been going on for hundreds of years, is their motherland not China, but other countries? Whether in language, residential area, economic life, or psychological state, don't the Hui people have close ties with all fraternal ethnic groups in China? Do they have ties with other countries instead? This is a truth that anyone can understand. The rightists' nonsense only exposes their own despicable and stupid nature. Second, although the main source of the Hui people is foreigners, as an ethnic group, it is completely a community of people who have grown up in China. The Hui ethnic group is a nation nurtured by Chinese soil. Before the emergence of the Hui ethnic group in China, there had never been such an ethnic group on this earth. Third, it is an old saying that the main source of the Hui ethnic group is foreigners. And since then, these foreigners have already begun to regard themselves as Chinese. This is what Zhou Mi's "Record of Miscellaneous Knowledge in Guixin" sequel said, "Today, Huihui all regard the Central Plains as their home," and Wang Li's "Linyuan Collection" Volume 6 said, "Many Western Regions people serve in the Central Dynasty, study in South China, enjoy the rivers and lakes, and forget their homeland. As the years go by, families are formed, and the end of the day is far away. Why should they still be concerned about the meaning of returning to their homeland?" Due to the domination of reactionary ideology, the rightists have regressed to the point where they are even inferior to people hundreds of years ago. Marxists will never stop studying the issue of the origin of the Hui ethnic group because of the rightists' nonsense. On the contrary, we must more comprehensively and deeply elucidate this issue so that the rightists have no room to argue.

Class Relations and Ethnic Relations

The class relations within the Hui ethnic group, the relations between the Hui ethnic group and fraternal ethnic groups, especially the relations between the Hui and Han, should occupy a major position in the history of the Hui ethnic group.

Class differentiation was very significant among the Huihui who came east during the Yuan Dynasty. This is reflected in several opposing aspects: "those with family backgrounds," "descendants of hereditary officials," and adult men and women and young children who were reduced to slaves; "rich and noble Huihui" and ordinary people; military craftsmen Fu Daruhuada and military craftsmen households. The army is a tool to suppress the people, but there are also oppositions between generals and soldiers, and between the officials in charge of the military farms and the people who cultivate the military farms. In religion, there are Ha Da masters (people in charge of religious laws) who interfere in the household marriages, money, grain, and lawsuits of the Huihui. The hereditary system of religious leaders also existed, such as the Xia Buluhan Ding family, who served as religious leaders in the Qingjing Temple in Quanzhou from the Yuan Dynasty to the Ming Dynasty.

Because the Huihui had not yet formed an ethnic group in the Yuan Dynasty, the class differentiation among the Huihui who came east at that time could not be said to be the class differentiation within the Hui ethnic group, but this has provided a prior historical condition for the later class differentiation within the Hui ethnic group. By the Ming Dynasty, the Hui ethnic group was formed, and class differentiation within the ethnic group also appeared. At this time, in the official manor, there was a distinction between landlords and peasants, and in the military settlements, there was a distinction between officials and soldiers. In the cities, there were civil and military officials, wealthy merchants and gentry, and self-reliant craftsmen and ordinary people. By the end of the Ming Dynasty, families of successive scholars had emerged in some areas of the Hui ethnic group, and at the same time, there were poor people who were wandering and dependent.

The Hui ethnic group in the Qing Dynasty inherited the feudal relations of the Ming Dynasty and had further development. As a religious form of feudal privilege, the Menhuan system began in the late Ming Dynasty and was further developed in the Qing Dynasty. The religious leaders and the "followers" in the Menhuan system are opposing classes under the religious cover. The Qing court also used Huihui generals to consolidate its feudal rule. Later, the Qing court also kept a group of Hui ethnic scoundrels as vicious tools for carrying out "using Hui to control Hui."

Starting with Ma Anliang's military power, after the Xinhai Revolution, a small group of feudal warlords developed in the Northwest region. Ma Qi, Ma Lin, and Ma Bufang and other brothers, fathers, and sons, and Ma Fuxiang and Ma Hongkui and other fathers, sons, and grandsons all became fierce rulers of the local Hui and Han ethnic groups. Later, Ma Hongkui, Ma Bufang, and others joined the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group and became agents of this criminal group within the Hui ethnic group, carrying out cruel exploitation and persecution of the local ethnic groups.

Huihui merchants were famous in history. How to estimate their role in the social development of the Hui ethnic group is a question to be studied. After the mid-Qing Dynasty, merchants who opened mines appeared among the Hui ethnic group, and miners also appeared. Perhaps they can be said to be the predecessors of Hui ethnic capitalists and industrial workers. When did capitalists and industrial workers begin to exist in the history of the Hui ethnic group? It is not yet possible to say. But the Hui ethnic group had capitalists and industrial workers long ago, and there were national capitalists and comprador capitalists among the capitalists, which can be affirmed.

Before the national liberation, the class relations in the history of the Hui ethnic group were mainly feudal relations, and the class contradictions were mainly the contradictions between the landlord class and the peasant class. The so-called "Huihui all over the world are one family," "Huihui meet and are three-point relatives," "Muslims are brothers," etc., which were popular within the Hui ethnic group in the past, are all ethnic and religious views that hinder class consciousness and are not in accordance with the historical reality of class relations. Talking about "one family," relatives, and brothers with landlords and capitalists only benefits their exploitation and oppression and is harmful and unprofitable to the working people.

The class struggle in the history of the Hui ethnic group, in addition to the general forms, has gone through more complex forms more than once. One form appears in the form of religious struggle. The book "The Hui Ethnic Question" (compiled by the Ethnic Question Research Association, reprinted by the Ethnic Publishing House) creatively analyzed the essence of the so-called "struggle between new and old religions" within the Hui ethnic group, pointing out that internal contradictions and struggles in the history of the Hui ethnic group often manifest themselves in the form of newly emerging sects opposing old sects. Another form of class struggle in the history of the Hui ethnic group is the joint struggle of the Hui ethnic people and people of other ethnic groups, especially the joint struggle of the Hui and Han people. This is the struggle of the Hui and Han people united to fight against the Hui and Han landlord class. During the great peasant uprising at the end of the Yuan Dynasty, several peasant leaders in Zhu Yuanzhang's army were recognized as Huihui by the Hui people. Although it cannot be fully confirmed due to insufficient documents, it can at least illustrate the close relationship between the Hui and Han people in the anti-Yuan struggle. During the great peasant uprising at the end of the Ming Dynasty, the army of Ma Shouying, a Huihui from Suide, northern Shaanxi, was one of the main forces of the "thirteen families and seventy-two battalions," and closely cooperated with Li Zicheng from northern Shaanxi to Anhui. In these two great uprisings, the Hui and Han landlord classes were of course the objects of struggle, and there would be no exceptions due to the different ethnic components. The reason why the joint struggle form was adopted by the Hui people is closely related to the mixed residence of ethnic groups. Due to the mixed residence of ethnic groups, the interests of the Hui people and the people of other ethnic groups are more easily linked together. At the same time, when fighting against the landlord class, due to the scattered residence, the Hui people can only grow stronger if they get the support of the vast people of fraternal ethnic groups.

When we talk about the joint struggle of the Hui people and the people of fraternal ethnic groups, we have actually touched on the ethnic relations in the history of the Hui ethnic group. This form of class struggle with ethnic unity is an excellent tradition in the history of the Hui ethnic group and also in the history of China. This tradition has been greatly developed under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, so that the Hui people have followed the Han elder brother and embarked on the road of national liberation. The form of class struggle with ethnic unity is an important part of ethnic relations in the history of the Hui ethnic group. Another important part is the history of common struggle in production. In agriculture, on the one hand, the Hui and Han people and people of other ethnic groups jointly reclaimed the land of the motherland, turning barren land into fertile fields. The opening up of Huihui villages and settlements in the north and south illustrates this point. On the other hand, the Hui people exchanged production experience with fraternal ethnic groups, first of all learning their advanced experience. The types of crops, agricultural tools, farming, fertilization, management, and harvesting techniques, well digging, canal digging, and irrigation and drainage methods of the Hui people in various places are basically the same as those of the Han farmers, which also illustrates this point. In handicraft industry, commerce, and transportation, the service objects of the Hui people in these industries are less directed to the Hui people and more directed to the Han people and other fraternal ethnic groups in more occasions.

The long-standing historical friendship between ethnic groups, especially between the Hui and Han people, should be the mainstream of ethnic relations in the history of the Hui ethnic group. We also do not need to shy away from the fact that ethnic disputes have also existed in history, which mainly comes from two aspects. One aspect comes from the ethnic oppression of the ruling class and the influence of great Han chauvinism, which is well known to everyone. The other aspect comes from the instigation of the exploiting classes and strata in the ethnic group. In order to facilitate the exploitation and oppression of the masses, they use the creation or expansion of ethnic disputes as a tool to achieve despicable goals. For example, the Hui and Han disputes in Qitai, Xinjiang, in the third year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty (1864) were caused by Ma Quan, the yamen servant of the prefectural government, often extorting money from the local Han people. Another example is some Han and Hui mining disputes that occurred in Yunnan in the mid-Qing Dynasty, which were actually caused by Han and Hui landlords instigating the Han and Hui people to fight for power and profit for a small number of them. Therefore, the ethnic disputes that appear in the history of the Hui ethnic group have different natures. The Hui people's struggle against the ruling class is just; the disputes created by the exploiting elements within the ethnic group are reactionary. It is wrong to say that all violent activities related to the Hui people are "Hui people's uprisings." Historical workers should conduct specific analysis for different questions.

Historical Figures

There are many figures in the history of the Hui ethnic group who need to be commented on.

The positive figures, first of all, are the advanced figures who have emerged from the Hui people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and the heroes in the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War. It is no problem to give correct praise to these figures. Secondly, there are the figures who opposed feudal oppression in the Middle Ages, such as Ma Shouying at the end of the Ming Dynasty and Li Yuanqing at the end of the Qing Dynasty. It is also no problem to praise such figures.

There are also two other types of figures. One type of figure is Li Zhi at the end of the Ming Dynasty, who came from a landlord family but became the flag bearer of anti-feudal ethics at that time. He had a great progressive influence in the ideological circles at that time and should be affirmed. Another type of figure is Sai Dianchi Shansiding in the Yuan Dynasty, who came from the ruling class and served the ruling class loyally. But objectively, he did things that were beneficial to the people and promoted social development. People like this should still be distinguished from ordinary feudal rulers and given some affirmation.

The negative figures in the history of the Hui ethnic group are also various. One type is the powerful figures of the feudal ruling class, such as Ah Heima in the Yuan Dynasty, who could do anything bad once he had power in hand. Another type is people like Ha Panlong in the Qing Dynasty, who served as the henchmen of the feudal ruling class, suppressing peasant uprisings and suppressing ethnic minorities for them. There is also a third type of person who sells the blood of their own people to dye their own hats red, and a fourth type of person who maintains the feudal privileges of religion and hinders the forward development of Hui society. As for Bai Chongxi, Ma Hongkui, Ma Bufang, etc., they are even unprecedented negative figures, and they are outside these four types of people.

The affirmation or negation of historical figures is not simple and clear for some people. Taking the evaluation of Du Wenxiu as an example, some people believe that Du Wenxiu colluded with the British in his later years to engage in traitorous activities, while others believe that there is no sufficient evidence to say that he engaged in traitorous activities. If only Du Wenxiu's revolution is recognized and his traitorous behavior is denied, then Du Wenxiu is fully affirmed or basically affirmed. If only the traitorous activities are emphasized, then he is denied. If it is believed that he was revolutionary in the first stage and traitorous later, then it is believed that there has been a great change in Du Wenxiu's life, and his first and second stages are given different evaluations respectively. According to my understanding, a conclusion cannot be drawn on the evaluation of Du Wenxiu for a while, and it still needs to be fully studied and discussed. The evaluation of historical figures has its complexity, and the evaluation of some people requires comprehensive and in-depth research.

As for the issue of the influence of historical figures, there are also several situations. One situation is that figures who have an impact on the whole country will inevitably have an impact within the ethnic group, such as Sai Dianchi Shansiding, Ah Heima, etc. Famous figures in politics probably have this situation. Another situation is that figures who have an impact on the whole country do not show a significant impact within the ethnic group. Gao Kegong's paintings, Sa Dula's poems, Ye Heideerding's architectural planning, Zhamalading's astronomy, and Li Zhi's theories all have an impact on the whole country, but it is not seen that they have a significant impact within the ethnic group. It is probably the case that famous figures in academic culture sometimes have this situation. The third situation is that they only have an impact within the ethnic group and rarely affect the outside world. Certain figures who have an influence in religion, such as Hu Puzhao, Ma Lianyuan, and Wang Kuan, and figures who have an influence in education, such as Tong Cong, all have this situation.

From the perspective of historical compilation, figures who have an impact within the ethnic group can of course be considered for writing into the history of the Hui ethnic group. Figures who have an impact on the whole country and also have an impact on their own ethnic group can of course also be considered for writing into the history of the Hui ethnic group. Only for figures who have an impact on the whole country but do not show a significant impact within the ethnic group, can they also be written into the history of the Hui ethnic group? I think these people should still be written into the history of the Hui ethnic group. Because the history of the Hui ethnic group is only a part of Chinese history, and we must always pay attention to the connection with the general history of China. Since these figures have an impact on the whole country, they also reflect a part of the ethnic relations in the history of the Hui ethnic group, and reflect a part of the connection between the Hui ethnic group and the whole country.

There are also internationally renowned figures in the history of the Hui ethnic group. For example, in the Ming Dynasty, there was Zheng He, who went to the Western Oceans seven times; in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 in the Qing Dynasty, there was Zuo Baogui, who defended Pyongyang and resisted the Japanese army. Appropriate space should be given to these figures.

There are also some legendary figures in the history of the Hui ethnic group who need to be examined. There are more of these in the Ming Dynasty. Before it can be confirmed, a reserved attitude should be maintained. For example, it is rumored that Hai Rui was a Hui ethnic person, but no basis has been found in the documents. Comrade Pei Zhi published an article "Is Hai Rui a Hui Ethnic Person?" in the "Guangming Daily" (November 26, 1959, sixth edition), providing some clues, but further proof is still needed. In addition, it is said that Mu Ying, Lan Yu, Hu Dahai, Ma Wensheng, etc. are all Hui ethnic people, but no credible evidence has been seen, and they all need to be examined.

Hui History Work

The four questions mentioned above are the questions that have been contacted more often. Some people have done some research and have collected a certain amount of data. However, there are still many questions contained in these four questions, which need to be studied in depth and meticulously. At the same time, more data should be collected for research.

In addition to these four questions, there is more work to be done in the history of the Hui ethnic group. Special studies on the economic history of the Hui ethnic group, the cultural history of the Hui ethnic group, and the modern revolutionary history of the Hui ethnic group should be carried out. First of all, we should seize the time to collect data on these three aspects and edit and publish them. More attention should be paid to the data on revolutionary history and the historical data in the memory of the working people. The more time passes for this type of data, the more losses there will be, and once it is lost, it cannot be recovered. We hope that comrades who have participated in the revolution for many years can, to the best of their memory, either write it themselves or dictate it to others to write it for them. Publishing these materials into books of "Revolutionary Memoirs" will be a very important contribution to the work of revolutionary history, which can also better educate the next generation. At the same time, we must organize some forces well, make the Hui ethnic group investigation work regularized, conduct key investigations on relevant people's communes, and write them into special books.

It is necessary to publish a brief history of the Hui ethnic group as soon as possible. In this way, on the one hand, we can summarize the relevant research results at the existing level, and on the other hand, we can promote everyone's interest and absorb everyone's opinions so that the work can be continuously improved.

I heard that Shanghai, Tianjin and other places have the compilation of local Hui ethnic history similar to the place. I think this work can be promoted. Due to the dispersed residence of the Hui ethnic group, there is a history of the Hui ethnic group wherever the Hui ethnic group lives. If more local Hui ethnic history is written, the data on the history of the Hui ethnic group will be enriched, and a national Hui ethnic history can be written better.

Some of the arguments in this article have been repeatedly discussed by a few comrades. For Comrade Luo Lan's article "Reviewing 'The History and Current Situation of the Hui Ethnic Group'" published in the December 1958 issue of "New Construction," this article has absorbed some valuable opinions from it, and it should be thanked here without noting them one by one. In the process of writing the article, I also discussed it with comrades Ma Shouqian, Yu Zhiying, Ma Enhui, and Ren Maotang, but the article was written according to my personal understanding, and I should be responsible for any errors.

    关于回族史的几个问题
    白寿彝
    编者按：我们的国家是一个多民族的国家，研究少数民族的历史是有重要意义的。这篇文章提出了回族史中若干有探讨价值的问题，我们把它发表出来以供读者参考。
    回族和伊斯兰教
    回族和伊斯兰教的关系，是回族史上首先遇到的问题。
    由于长久的旧的影响，一直到现在还有人把回族和伊斯兰教等同起来。这显然是不符合事实的。
    公元七世纪，伊斯兰教在阿拉伯创立。十多个世纪来，在西亚、北非和东南亚有不少的民族接受了这个宗教的信仰。但在这些地区里，并没有因此而产生了回族。同时，在这些信仰伊斯兰教的民族中，也并不能说，每一个人都有这样的宗教信仰而没有什么例外。
    伊斯兰教在创立后不久，就经由波斯、阿拉伯商人而为中国人所知。历经唐、五代、宋，中国也并没有因为这个宗教的传入和波斯、阿拉伯穆斯林（信仰伊斯兰教的人）的侨居而出现了回族。元代，回族开始在形成中。这时的“回回”，绝大部分可相信为穆斯林，但也并非所有的回回都是穆斯林。例如，元代回回药物学世家爱薛和他的儿子鲁合相继掌管广惠司（修制回回药物的机构），“元史”“世祖本纪”（至元十年）也有明文说爱薛是回回，但爱薛的宗教信仰就不一定是伊斯兰教，而可能是耶稣教。此后，在回族的形成和发展中，伊斯兰教也在回回中有所发展，但不信仰伊斯兰教的回回仍是存在的。并且，在元以后，维吾尔族、哈萨克族、东乡族、柯尔克孜族、撒拉族、乌孜别克族、塔吉克族、塔塔儿族、保安族，都先后成为有伊斯兰教信仰的民族，从而中国境内信仰这个宗教的民族也不以回族为限。
    一个穆斯林，可能是回族人，也可能不是回族人而是别族人。一个回回，很可能是穆斯林，但也不一定就是穆斯林。回族，作为一个民族，具备自己的居住条件、经济条件、共同语言和共同心理。如果离开了这些，回族是无法体现为一个民族的。伊斯兰教信仰只是在一定历史条件下回族人社会意识的一种形态，回族并不能从宗教信仰上体现为一个民族。伊斯兰教信仰，作为回族人意识形态的一个特征来看，也并不是在每一个地区都是一样的。在回汉杂居地区，这是一个特征。在回族和维吾尔族杂居地区，这就不是一个特征，而语言的区别成为民族的特征了。
    在区别回族和伊斯兰教的时候，我们并不忽视回族和伊斯兰教的联系。伊斯兰教是和回族有悠久历史关系的宗教。某些具有普遍性的民族习惯，如饮食婚丧等，从历史原因来说，也和伊斯兰教有关。在中国共产党尚未诞生，回族人民尚未获得正确的解放道路以前，伊斯兰教也曾经被作为号召和组织反压迫斗争的工具。在另一方面，伊斯兰教从元代起，就被封建皇朝利用为统治回回大众的工具，而先后以“回回大师哈的所”（以宗教法律判案的机构）、“敕赐礼拜寺”、及用阿訇充当乡约等等形式出现。伊斯兰教于明中叶以后在回族中的发展，实际上是回族内部阶级分化益形发展的结果。甘肃门宦制度（以教主兼大地主的世袭制度）是当地寺院地主经济发展的反映，陕西、山东的经堂教育是当地中小地主经济发展的反映，南京、苏州汉译宗教书的出现也和当地手工业商业经济的发展有关。伊斯兰教虽也曾被用为号召和组织反压迫的工具，但是它往往只能指向“真理的彼岸”的“幻想的要求”，只能指向为宗教而死，而不能把斗争引向“人间的真理”，指出现实斗争的正确方向。并且，伊斯兰教也像某些宗教一样，以向全“人类”说教的形式出现，这只有使阶级矛盾在“人类”的名义下得到隐蔽，而便于剥削阶级利用为欺骗被剥削阶级的工具。和宗教有关的民族习惯，在历史上曾经显示它在不同时期不同地区的变化或差异，近年更有不少的变化，并且还在变化中。具体的民族习惯也都不是亘古永存的东西。
    回族和伊斯兰教的复杂关系，也表明二者被混而为一的一部分的客观原因。但二者间的关系无论怎样复杂，究竟有不可逾越的界限。错误地把二者混同起来，这不仅不符合事实，并且在现实生活上有很大的危害。在不断革命、不断跃进的形势中，回族在不断发展。这种发展，是回族人民在政治生活、经济生活和文化生活的发展，决不能以宗教的是否发展作为衡量的尺度。如果把宗教和民族混同起来，或者强调宗教的作用，那末就会束缚了回族人民在民族大家庭中力争上游的手脚，这是和党的总路线背道而驰的。
                回族的来源
    回族的来源，是一个意见比较分歧的问题。一个意见认为，回族来源于唐代的回纥。第二个意见认为，元时从中央亚细亚、波斯和阿拉伯等地东来的回回是回族的主要来源。第三个意见认为，回族是以原来的突厥族为主导，并和东来的波斯人、阿富汗人、阿拉伯人等混合而成。最近还有一个意见，认为汉族是回族的主要来源。
    从文献上看，宋元祐年间（1086—1093），沈括“梦溪笔谈”记西北边兵凯歌，开始提出“回回”一词。他所说的“回回”，指的是当时在安西一带居住的回鹘（现在的维吾尔），显然和我们现在所说的“回回”不同。
    在宋嘉熙元年（1237）成书的徐霆的“黑鞑事略”中，有好几处说到“回回”，包含有“回回国”（花刺子模）、抗里（康里在咸海北）、克鼻稍（钦察、在黑海北岸）。他所说“回回字”的“回回”，又指的是回鹘。这显然也和我们现在所说的“回回”不同。
    元代记载中，“回回”一词大量出现，并且含义也明确了。这可说明回回在当时的政治生活和社会生活里已占有相当地位了。在陶宗仪“南村辍耕录”中，回回是和钦察、康里、唐兀等族分开的。在官文书中，回回是和汉人、畏吾儿（维吾尔）分开的。在“至顺镇江志”卷三的“户口”项下，记有蒙古二十九户，畏吾儿一十四户，回回五十九户，也里可温二十三户。这可说明元代户籍也是把回回和畏吾儿作了明确的区别的。
    元代文人喜欢古雅而搬用旧来的名称，以致把回回、回纥、回鹘等名词混用起来。但即是这样，他们也还是能分别回回和畏吾儿的不同的。王恽在“秋涧先生大全文集”卷九十五说：“回鹘今外五，回纥今回回。”案：“回鹘”、“回纥”是一词的异译，不应分而为二；“回纥”、“回回”也不应合而为一。但外五（畏吾儿、维吾尔）和回回的不同，王恽还是很明白的，他只是把古今用词的沿革弄错了。
    明人著作中出现过把回回和维吾尔混合起来的情况。但在熟悉新疆的记载中，二者是有明确的区分的。如“殊域周咨录”卷十二，记哈密有三种人，“一种、回回，一种、畏兀儿，一种、哈刺灰”。这里的区别是很清楚的。
    在清人的一些著作中，开始有以伊斯兰教作为民族惟一标志的情况。他们把回回和维吾尔混称为“回”，而又称回回是“汉回”、“熟回”，维吾尔是“缠回”、“生回”。尽管他们的用语含有民族歧视的意味，但他们究竟还是不能不承认二者间的区别。并且在清代，回族人也只是沿用元明以来的称呼，自称为回回，而维吾尔人是从来不以“回”自称的。
    从自元代以来长久习用的“回回”一词所代表的具体内容来看，“回回”就是今天的回族，而不是维吾尔族。因此，作为“维吾尔”同意异译语的“回纥”或“回鹘”，是不能和回族混淆起来看的。认为回族来源于唐代的回纥，这从我们见到的记载看，是不合历史事实的。
    元代记载所说的回回，一般是指来自中央亚细亚、波斯和阿拉伯等地的人。这些人是由于蒙古贵族的西征而东迁的，其中有工匠、军士、商人、学者和贵族。元代的回回人名和有关回回的记载，都可说明这一点。在回族内部流行的所谓“西域回回”的传说，也是可以和文献记载相印证的。
    这些东来的回回，是后来形成回族的主要来源。回族来源中还包含有中国境内土著民族的成员和唐宋以来久居中国的波斯人和阿拉伯人。
    原来，元代东来回回中的上层人物是有携带眷属的。但总的说来，由于当时交通条件和战时条件的困难，东迁回回总应以男子占多数。在这种情况下，回回既然要在中国住下来，就不免要和土著的妇女结婚。因为是在男权中心的社会中，这些和回回婚配的妇女就成为回族来源的一部分了。由于回汉杂居的地方比较多，汉人和回回婚配的应比别民族的人多。有人曾经作过研究，找出元代文献中汉女嫁回男的一些事例。当然，历史上曾经存在过的事例是要远比文献上的记载多得多的。
    作为回族的来源，汉人以外，有蒙古人、维吾尔人等。他们所以成为回族的一部分，除婚姻的原因外，还有的是由于政治的原因，有的是由于经济的或宗教的原因。他们不只是在元代成为回族的一部分来源，并且在后来也还有陆续加入回族的。在另一方面，和回族不断吸收别的民族成分的同时，也有人由回族转变为别族的。
    当然，汉人在回族构成中的地位是相当重要的。但是，如把汉人作为回族的主要来源，那就不一定妥当。因为，回族既然主要是在和汉族杂居的情况下发展起来的，说汉人在这样的情况下脱离了本民族而另成为形成回族的主要力量，是不近情理的。
    回族来源中也可能包含突厥人，即土耳其人。这可能是作为中亚细亚人的一部分而在元代到中国来的。但如说回族的主要来源是原来居住中国境内及其邻近地区的突厥人，那就没有什么可供搜索的踪迹了。有人引徐珂“清稗类钞”中“回族一称土耳其族，源出突厥”为证。其实，“清稗类钞”是近人的一部杂抄，不能拿它作为论证数百年前史事的依据，这是无须解释的。并且，这部书所说的“回”也是和我们所说的“回族”不同的。
    资产阶级右派分子曾妄图利用回族来源问题，叫嚷“中国不是回回的祖国”。这种胡说是不值一驳的。第一，民族的分散、融合和迁徙，在世界历史上并不是希见的。迁徙后的民族成员，他们的祖国不是在悠远的和现实生活没有任何联系的旧日居住的地区，而是他们和他们的祖先实际参与缔造的当前的国家。一部分阿拉伯人、希腊人既已同罗马人、日耳曼人、额特鲁思亚人形成了近代意大利民族，阿拉伯和希腊就不是他们的祖国了，而意大利是他们的祖国。一部分英吉利人从英国移到了美洲，形成了美利坚民族，英国就不再是他们的祖国，而美国成为他们的祖国了。同样，东来的中亚细亚人、波斯人和阿拉伯人等既同兄弟民族的成员在中国形成了回族，已达数百年之久，难道他们的祖国不是中国，反而是别的国家吗？无论在语言上、在居住地区上、在经济生活上、在心理状态上，难道回族和中国各兄弟民族没有密切的联系吗？难道和别的国家反而有联系吗？这是任何人都可以晓得的道理，右派分子的胡说只有暴露他们自己的卑鄙和愚蠢罢了。第二，回族虽以外来人为主要的来源，但作为一个民族却完全是在中国地面上土生土长起来的人们共同体。回族完全是中国土地哺育起来的民族，在中国出现回族以前，这个地球上是从没有这样的一个民族的。第三，说回族的主要来源是外来人，已是几百年前的老话了。并且从那时候起，这些外来人也已经开始以中国人自居了。这就是周密“癸辛杂识”续集所说“今回回皆以中原为家”，王礼“麟原集”卷六所说“西域之仕于中朝，学于南夏，乐江湖而忘乡国者众矣。岁久家成，日暮途远，尚何屑屑首丘之义乎？”由于反动思想的支配，右派分子反而倒退到连几百年以前的人都不如了。马克思主义者决不因右派的胡说就不研究回族来源问题。正相反，我们要更全面而深入地阐明这一问题，使右派分子无置喙的余地。
            阶级关系和民族关系
    回族内部的阶级关系，回族和兄弟民族间的关系，特别是回汉间的关系，应在回族史上占有主要的地位。
    阶级的分化，在元代的东来回回中就是很显著的。这表现在几个对立面上：“有门阀者”、“世官子孙”和沦为奴婢的成年男女及幼童；“富贵回回”和一般平民；军匠府达鲁花达和军匠人户。军队是镇压人民的工具，但军队内部也有将官和士卒的对立、屯田官和屯田人户的对立。宗教上有哈的大师（掌教法的人），干预回回的户婚、钱粮、词讼。教长世袭的制度也有了，如夏不鲁罕丁一家，在泉州清净寺担任教长，从元一直到明。
    因在元代回回尚没有形成一个民族，当时东来回回中的阶级分化还不能说是回族内部的阶级分化，但这已为后来回族内部的阶级分化提供了先行的历史条件。到了明代，回族形成了，民族内部的阶级分化也就出现了。这时，在官僚田庄中有地主和农民之分，在军屯中有官和兵之分。在城市里，有文官武将、富商士贾，也有自食其力的手工业者和普通的老百姓。到了明末，回族在某些地区出现了科第联绵的世家，同时也出现了流浪无依的贫民。
    清代回族继承了明代的封建关系而有进一步的发展。作为封建特权的宗教形式，门宦制度开始于明后叶，也是到清更为发展。门宦制度中的教主和“教下”，是宗教遮盖下的对抗的阶级。清廷还利用回回将领巩固他的封建统治。后来，清廷又豢养了一批回族败类，作为进行“以回制回”的恶毒工具。
    以马安良的军权为起点，辛亥革命后，西北地区发展成一小撮封建军阀，马麒、马麟和马步芳等兄弟父子，马福祥、马鸿逵等父子祖孙都成为当地回汉各族人民的凶恶统治者。后来，马鸿逵、马步芳等投靠了蒋介石卖国集团，成为这一罪恶集团在回族内部的代理人，对于当地各族人民进行残酷的压榨和迫害。
    回回商人在历史上是有名的。如何估计他们在回族社会发展中的作用，是一个有待研究的问题。清中叶后，回族中出现了开矿的商人，也出现了矿丁，他们也许可以说是回族资本家和产业工人的前身吧。在回族史上，究竟在什么时候开始有了资本家和产业工人，现在还说不来。但回族早已有了资本家和产业工人，并且资本家中也有民族资本家和买办资本家之分，这是可以肯定的。
    全国解放前，回族史上的阶级关系主要是封建关系，阶级矛盾主要是地主阶级和农民阶级间矛盾。过去回族内部流行的，所谓“天下回回是一家”，“回回见面三分亲”，“穆斯林是弟兄”等等，都是阻碍阶级觉悟的民族观点和宗教观点，是不符合阶级关系的历史实际的。同地主和资本家讲“一家”、讲亲戚、讲弟兄，只有利于他们的剥削和压榨，对于劳动人民是有害而无利的。
    回族史上的阶级斗争，除一般的形式以外，是不止一次地通过了比较复杂的形式进行的。一种形式是以宗教斗争形式出现的。“回回民族问题”一书（民族问题研究会编，民族出版社有重印本）曾创见性地分析了回族内部所谓“新旧争教”的实质，指出回族史上的内部矛盾和斗争往往以新起的教派反对旧有的教派的形式表现出来。回族史上阶级斗争的另一种形式是回族人民和别族人民的联合斗争，特别是回汉人民的联合斗争。这是回汉人民联合起来对抗回汉地主阶级的斗争。元末农民大起义时，朱元璋军中很有几个农民领袖被回族人民认作回回。虽因文献不足，不能一一证实，但这也至少可以说明回汉人民在反元斗争中的亲密关系。明末农民大起义时，陕北绥德回回马守应的军队是当时“十三家七十二营”主力之一，从陕北到安徽，一直和李自成密切合作。在这两次大起义中，回汉地主阶级当然都是被斗争的对象，决不会因民族成分的不同而有什么例外的。联合斗争形式之所以为回族人民所采用，这和民族杂居有很大的关系。由于民族的杂居，回族人民和别族人民间的利害就更容易绾联在一起。同时，在对地主阶级进行斗争时，由于居住的分散，回族人民只有得到兄弟民族广大人民的支援才能壮大起来。
    当我们说到回族人民和兄弟民族人民的联合斗争时，实际上我们已接触到了回族史上的民族关系。这种民族联合的阶级斗争形式是回族史上，也是中国史上的优良传统。这一传统在中国共产党领导下得到大大的发扬，从而回族人民跟随汉族老大哥走上了民族解放的道路。民族联合的阶级斗争形式是回族史上民族关系的一个重要部分。另外还有一个重要部分是在生产上共同斗争的历史。在农业上，一方面是回汉人民和其他各族人民一起，共同开垦了祖国的土地，变榛芜为良田。南北各地回回村屯的开辟都说明了这一点。另一方面，回族人民和兄弟民族交流了生产经验，首先是学习了他们的先进经验。各地回族人的农作物种类，农具、耕种、施肥、管理和收割的技术，挖井、开渠和灌水排水的方法，基本上和汉族农民的一致，也说明了这一点。在手工业、商业、交通运输业上，回族从业者的服务对象，与其说是面向回民，勿宁说在更多的场合是面向汉人和其他兄弟民族。
    民族间，特别是回汉人民间悠久的历史友谊，应该是回族史上民族关系的主流。我们也无须讳言，历史上也存在着民族纠纷，这主要是来自两个方面。一个方面是来自统治阶级的民族压迫及大民族主义的影响，这是大家所熟知的。另一个方面是来自民族中剥削阶级、阶层的挑拨。他们为了便于对人民群众进行剥削和压迫，就以制造或扩大民族纠纷为达到卑鄙目的的工具。举例来说，清同治三年（1864），新疆奇台的回汉纠纷，是知州衙门的差役马全经常倚势敲诈当地汉民而引起的。又如清中叶云南发生的某些汉回夺矿事件，实际上是汉回财主们挑唆汉回人民为他们一小撮人争权夺利而引起的。因此，回族史上出现的民族纠纷，是具有不同性质的。回族人民为反抗统治阶级而进行斗争，是正义的；民族内剥削分子所制造的纠纷，是反动的。把一切与回民有关的暴力活动都说成是“回民起义”，是错误的。历史工作者应针对不同问题进行具体的分析。
                    历史人物
    回族史上有不少人物，有待于评述。
    正面的人物，首先是在中国共产党领导下回族人民中涌现的先进人物，以及抗日战争、解放战争中的英雄人物，必须进行正确的表扬，这是没有问题的。其次是在中世纪反对封建压迫的人物，如明末的马守应、清末的李沅庆，表扬这样的人物，也是没有问题的。
    另外还有两种人物。一种人物如明末的李贽，出身于地主家庭，但成为当时反封建礼教的旗手。他在当时的思想界起了很大的进步影响，是应该肯定的。又一种人物，如元代的赛典赤赡思丁，出身于统治阶级，又忠心耿耿地为统治阶级服务。但在客观上，他作了有利于人民的事情，作了促进社会发展的事情。像这样的人，也还是应该把他和一般的封建统治者加以区别，从而有所肯定的。
    回族史上的反面人物，也是各色各样的。一种是封建统治阶级的当权人物，如元代的阿合马，一朝权在手，就什么坏事情都作得出来。又一种如清代的哈攀龙等，是充当封建统治阶级的鹰犬，为他们镇压农民起义、镇压少数民族。还有以出卖本族人民的鲜血去染红自己的顶子的第三种人，和维护宗教的封建特权、阻碍回族社会向前发展的第四种人。至于白崇禧、马鸿逵、马步芳等，他们更是空前的反面人物，又在这四种人以外了。
    历史人物的肯定或否定，对于某些人来说，并不是简单明确的。以对于杜文秀的评价为例，有的人认为杜文秀晚期勾通英国人进行卖国勾当，有的人认为说他进行卖国勾当是没有充分证据的。如果只承认杜文秀革命而否认他有卖国行为，那就把杜文秀全面肯定或基本肯定了。如果单强调卖国，那就把他否定了。如果认为他在前一段是革命的而后来卖国了，那就是认为杜文秀的一生有了很大的变化，而把他的前一段和后一段分别给以不同的评价了。依我的了解，对于杜文秀的评价还一时作不出结论来，还有待于充分的研究和讨论。历史人物评价有其复杂性，对于某些人的评价是需要全面深入的研究的。
    至于历史人物的影响问题，这也存在着好几种情况。一种情况是，对全国有影响的人物必然在民族内部也有影响，如赛典赤赡思丁、阿合马等。政治上的著名人物大概都有这种情形。另一种情况是，对全国有影响的人物在民族内部反而看不出显著的影响来。高克恭的画，萨都剌的诗，也黑迭儿丁的建筑规划，扎马剌丁的天文学，李贽的学说，都对于全国有影响，但反而看不到在民族内部的显著影响。大概在学术文化上的著名人物，有时是有这种情形的。第三种情况是，只在民族内部有影响，而很少影响到外面。某些在宗教上有影响的人物如胡普照、马联元、王宽等，在教育上有影响的人物如童琮等，都有这样的情形。
    从历史编纂学的角度来看，在民族内部有影响的人物，当然是可以考虑写进回族史的。对全国有影响、对本民族也有影响的人物，当然也是可以考虑写进回族史的。只有对于在全国有影响而在民族内部反而看不到有显著影响的人物，是否也可以写进回族史呢？我以为，这些人还是要写进回族史里去的。因为，回族史只是中国史的一部分，必须经常注意和中国通史的联系。这些人物既对于全国有影响，也就体现了回族史上的民族关系的一个部分，体现了回族和全国联系的一个部分。
    回族史上还有国际闻名的人物。如在明代，有七次下西洋的郑和；在清代中日甲午之战，有守卫平壤抵抗日军的左宝贵。对于这些人物，是应该给与适当的篇幅的。
    回族史上又有一些传说人物，有待于考定。这以明代的人物为较多。在不能证实以前，应持保留的态度。如海瑞，相传是回族人，但一直没有在文献上找到根据。佩之同志在“光明日报”（1959年11月26日第六版）发表了“海瑞是否回族”一文，提供了一些线索，但还需要作进一步的证明。此外，如沐英、兰玉、胡大海、马文升等，据说都是回族人，但一直没有见到可信的证据，都有待于考定。
                    回族史工作
    以上所说的四个问题，是接触较多的问题，已曾有人作过一些研究并在资料上有了一定数量的搜集。但在这四个问题里面也还包含有不少的问题，需要进行深入细致的研究，同时也应该搜集更多的资料以供研究。
    回族史在这四个问题以外，还有更多的工作需要做。回族经济史、回族文化史、回族现代革命史的专题研究，都应该有所开展。首先应该抓紧时间，搜集这三个方面的资料，并且加以编辑出版。更应该注意的是革命史的资料和劳动人民记忆中的历史资料。像这一类的资料，经过时间越多，就损失越多，并且是一经损失就不可弥补了。我们希望参加革命多年的同志们，能就记忆所及，或自己写，或口授别人代写。把这些材料集成一本一本的“革命回忆录”出版，对于革命史的工作将是很重要的贡献，这也可以更好地教育下一代。同时，要很好地组织一些力量，把回族调查工作经常化起来，对有关的人民公社进行重点调查，写成专书。
    尽早出版一部回族简史是必要的。这样，一方面可就现有的水平总结有关的研究成果，另一方面也可推动大家的兴趣，吸取大家的意见，使工作得以不断提高。
    听说上海、天津等地都有近似地方回族史的编写。我想，这个工作是可以提倡的。由于回族居住的分散，有回族居住的地方就有回族的历史。如果地方回族史写出的多了，回族史的资料就丰富了，一部全国性的回族史就可以写得更好些了。
    这篇文章中的某些论点，是经过少数同志反复讨论过的。对于罗蓝同志在1958年12月号“新建设”上发表的“评‘回回民族的历史和现状’”一文，本文吸收了其中一些珍贵意见，没有一一注明，应在此表示感谢。文章写作过程中，又和马寿千、玉质瑛、马恩惠、任茂堂同志进行了讨论，但文章是按我个人的理解写的，如有错误，应由我负责。
