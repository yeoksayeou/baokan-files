People's Commune Moves Poyang Lake
　　——Xiaohuang People's Commune in Dongxiang, Jiangxi, Transforms Nature by Moving Mountains and Creating Seas
　　Hu Tingtang, Liu Jie, Cai Fang
　　In the winter of 1958 and spring of 1959, the Xiaohuang People's Commune in Dongxiang County, Jiangxi Province, built two large reservoirs in just one hundred days that could irrigate more than 40,000 mu of paddy fields, eliminating the threat of drought and flood disasters that had plagued the area for thousands of years. In the spring of 1959, it also transformed a large area of low-yield fields, increasing the yield of the early rice season to 90% of the total output for the entire year of 1958, turning this historically grain-deficient area into a surplus grain area. The commune members exclaimed: "The People's Commune has moved Poyang Lake and also moved Golden Mountain!"

　　A Bitter Memory
　　Water is what the people of Xiaohuang have longed for generation after generation. Surrounded by mountains and undulating hills, this area covers 270 square kilometers and has neither lakes nor large rivers. After a few days of sunshine, the parched thin soil is completely dried out; after a few days of heavy rain, yellow water rolls everywhere, creating a muddy mess.
　　Due to the lack of water, the farmers here had to spend almost one-third of their time hauling water every year, until they were exhausted, and the ponds and ditches were dry. Due to the lack of water, crop yields were pitifully low.
　　Water is more precious than life here! Older people still clearly remember this incident: During the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty, the masses of Liantang and Yu's villages, under the instigation and provocation of feudal landlords, fought a lawsuit over a pond of water, all the way to the Governor-General's office. The Governor-General had no solution, so he ordered someone to bring a red-hot iron boot to the court and said, "Whichever village dares to have someone put on this iron boot, that village will be granted the water pond." At this tense moment, Yu Xingke, an old farmer in his sixties from Liantang Village, resolutely stepped out of the crowd and put his bare foot into the red-hot iron boot, exchanging his life for the right to irrigate a pond of water. However, how much land could one pond irrigate? When people spread the story of "Grandpa Xingke," they could not help but shake their heads and sigh, saying: "Water is more precious than gold; water is life! If we want to live a good life, unless we move Poyang Lake here." At the time, this was just an unattainable dream. Every year during the Qingming Festival, some old farmers would take their children and grandchildren to "Grandpa Xingke's" grave to burn incense and paper money, praying for good weather. However, "Grandpa Xingke" was ignorant after death, and Heaven did not show mercy. Drought still occurred, and in severe cases, even drinking water for people was difficult.

　　A Beautiful Wish
　　After liberation, the people of Xiaohuang repaired the existing 3,000 "lampstand ponds" and "saucer ponds," and built more than 200 new water conservancy projects, expanding the irrigated area by more than 10,000 mu. In this area with undulating hills and barren soil, water conservancy projects that irrigated 500 to 1,000 mu of land appeared for the first time, and more than 100 mu of double-season late rice were planted for the first time ever. However, these projects were relatively small. Of the commune's more than 70,000 mu of cultivated land, more than 60% still lacked reliable irrigation facilities. In the event of a prolonged drought, agricultural production would still suffer severely.
　　In the past, when people passed by Hengshan and Huashankou, seeing that both places had small openings and large bellies, they had imagined: If a mountain pack could grow on the pass to block the water, the area below the mountain would be free from drought and flood. But this was just a fantasy; how could a mountain pack grow out of thin air? After the realization of advanced cooperativization in 1956, everyone discussed building reservoirs in these two places. After the reservoirs were built, they could irrigate more than 40,000 mu of land. What a desirable thing this would be! However, after several cooperatives discussed it, they were stumped. First, the two reservoirs would occupy more than 5,000 mu of land in total. Who would compensate for this? Second, four villages, 293 households, would have to be relocated. How would they be resettled? Third, hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of earth would have to be excavated. Where would so much labor come from? Fourth, tens of thousands of yuan would have to be invested. Where would this money come from? At that time, an advanced cooperative had only two or three hundred households. Such a weak force could not bear such a huge burden, and the plan was difficult to realize.
　　In 1958, encouraged by the situation of the overall Great Leap Forward, the people of Xiaohuang were more eager than ever to solve the water conservancy problem. Because if the water problem was not solved, too much labor would be occupied hauling water, and it would not be possible to extract more labor to implement intensive cultivation, tap land potential, open up more avenues for increasing production, and develop diversified economies. Therefore, they had to decide to build the Hengshan Reservoir again. The Engineering Committee was established, and the labor tasks for each township were also assigned. However, the masses of Shanbi Township believed that they would benefit little and their enthusiasm was not high; the bamboo and wood tasks assigned to Yu's Township were also not welcomed. The matter of building the reservoir had to be shelved again.
　　From these contradictions, the broad masses of commune members deeply felt that the original small cooperatives could no longer adapt to the needs of further development of productive forces, and urgently demanded breaking down the boundaries of townships and cooperatives and merging small cooperatives into large cooperatives. After news of the establishment of people's communes in various places reached Xiaohuang in August 1958, the masses cheered and were excited. Applications flew in from all directions like snowflakes. In this way, 35 agricultural cooperatives in the four townships of Xiaohuang, Yu's, Po?, and Shanbi were merged to form the Xiaohuang People's Commune.

　　Poyang Lake is Moved Here
　　The People's Commune does things very differently from the past. Because it has many superior conditions, it does things as soon as it says it will. On the same day that the commune was established, the Hengshan and Huashan Water Conservancy Engineering Committee was established. The commune members all happily said, "This is double happiness." Indeed, as soon as the commune was established, it showed its unparalleled superiority. Because the commune is large in scale, strong in organizational power, and wide in scope of activity, it can uniformly plan the production of the entire commune and rationally arrange the use of manpower, material resources, and financial resources. The problems encountered in the original reservoir construction were all solved one by one. The abandoned fields can be uniformly adjusted by the commune, the families to be relocated can be properly resettled by the brigades separately, the labor force can be uniformly allocated by the commune, and the required investment can be afforded by the commune.
　　A great struggle to move mountains and create seas and conquer nature began. The commune members issued the bold statement: "Relying on the commune to run water conservancy, we will harness the Dragon King as a horse!" Of the commune's more than 10,500 male and female laborers, although more than 3,000 were extracted to make steel, because more than 4,000 women were liberated from tedious household labor and bravely undertook all the autumn harvest and autumn planting tasks, it was still possible to transfer more than 3,000 laborers to march toward water conservancy. Regarding the material, financial, and technical forces required for the project, they adhered to the spirit of self-reliance based on the characteristics of the People's Commune of "large-scale and public ownership," and put forward the heroic slogan: "Make our own steel bars, cut our own wood and bamboo, make our own tools, burn our own cement and lime, cultivate our own technical force, raise our own funds, make our own explosives, make our own culverts, and quarry our own stones." After this slogan was put forward, it was truly invincible and indestructible. If the technical force was insufficient, the commune opened a training class on the construction site and trained more than 30 construction workers. The project needed a large amount of cement and lime, so it sent 12 commune members to Zhanwei Commune nearby to learn how to burn cement, and sent 100 commune members to the commune's own lime mine to burn lime. Lacking steel bars, they collected scrap iron from the commune members, transferred technicians with higher skills, and used earth furnaces and iron hammers to make more than 3,000 jin of steel bars. The more than 140 handicraft workers drawn from various teams also established factories on the construction site, created 230 sections of earth trains, 30 wooden rails, and four aerial cableways, saving more than 40,000 workdays. The culverts on the canal were originally planned to use cement, but later they were changed to tile pipes specially made by their own brick and tile kilns. The five water diversion aqueducts were also originally planned to use reinforced concrete, but later they were made of wood and bamboo. These wood and bamboo were cut by the commune's organized labor force in Yu's Brigade.
　　The two reservoir projects were quite arduous. There were a total of 760,000 cubic meters of earth and stone, the total length of the canal was 100 li, it had to cross more than 50 mountain peaks, pass through more than 200 mountain valleys and streams, and erect 180 sections of wooden flood diversion pipes (380 meters long), with more than 60 auxiliary buildings. The irrigation area included more than 40,000 mu of cultivated land within the original 35 advanced cooperatives. Such a vast and arduous project could not be completed by the individual strength of an advanced cooperative alone. After the establishment of the commune, 3,000 laborers, relying on the support of the commune's material resources, fought day and night for 100 days and successfully completed the entire project of the two reservoirs.
　　On the day when the Hengshan Reservoir was released, the long canal was filled with joyful people. When the clear canal water was flowing, people could not restrain the joy and excitement in their hearts. Zou Ruhe, an 82-year-old farmer, walked along the canal for eight li, walking and laughing, laughing from ear to ear. Many people said, "The problem (water) that had not been solved in many dynasties was quickly solved after the establishment of the People's Commune. It has made great contributions all at once. It is really thanks to Chairman Mao!" Some said: "In the past, one harvest was not guaranteed, now three harvests are no problem." Water, passing through mountains and ridges, passing through fields and slopes, rushing to Shanbi, 20 li away, and flying to Xiahu, 30 li away, four winding trunk canals, like two pairs of beautiful dragon whiskers, irrigate more than 40,000 mu of Xiaohuang's land. In the past, people often said: "If you want water in Xiaohuang, unless you move Poyang Lake here." Now, relying on the power of the People's Commune, Poyang Lake has truly been moved here.

　　It is Always Spring Here
　　The completion of the reservoir brought an extraordinary spring to Xiaohuang in 1959.
　　The Xiaohuang Commune has more than 54,000 mu of early rice and more than 13,000 mu of single-season late rice. Among these paddy fields, there are more than 27,000 mu of low-yield fields with a yield of about 100 jin per mu. The main reasons for the low yield are poor water conservancy conditions and extensive cultivation. Now that the water problem has been solved, a large number of laborers who were used to fight drought can be freed up. According to statistics, the entire commune can save 200,000 workdays throughout 1959. In addition, the entire commune has appropriately adjusted the land and eliminated more than 6,000 mu of interspersed fields, which can also save a lot of labor. Therefore, people's attention has turned to this large area of low-yield fields. Facing this area of low-yield fields, they said with confidence: "The People's Commune can move Poyang Lake, and it can also move Golden Mountain!"
　　At the beginning of the 1959 spring plowing and production, the Xiaohuang Commune mobilized thousands of troops to join the battle to transform low-yield fields. This was also difficult to do during the advanced cooperative. The commune's 28 brigades formed 58 professional teams, and adopted the method of large-scale operations, setting off a massive movement to accumulate and transport fertilizer to ensure sufficient base fertilizer for the low-yield fields. The particularly poor fields were given even more fertilizer, and most of the low-yield fields were plowed three times, harrowed twice, and hoed once. In addition, because some of the low-yield fields were often eroded by mountain floods, the commune launched a comprehensive plan based on the situation of soil erosion while mobilizing everyone to transform the low-yield fields. It organized laborers to build ridges along the mountains and open ponds at the foot of the mountains to prevent soil erosion. It also planted trees and forests in all possible places of mountain flood erosion to eradicate mountain flood erosion.
　　Low-yield fields are generally far from the villages. For the convenience of management, Xu Shunxi, the first secretary of the commune's Party committee, first built the first thatched shed on Gulaogang and moved the headquarters for transforming low-yield fields to the low-yield slopes, fighting in the fields during the day and sleeping with the rice at night. Subsequently, thatched sheds appeared one after another on the low-yield slopes, and even pig farms and fertilizer plants went to the slopes one after another. The 58 professional teams all set up camps on the low-yield slopes. In this way, remote fields became nearby fields, barren fields became fertile fields, and the seedlings in low-yield fields closely chased the seedlings in high-yield fields. The commune members excitedly said: "Now production has really changed a lot."
　　In the first summer harvest after the people's commune, Xiaohuang saw a miraculous miracle. The commune's more than 50,560 mu of early rice achieved a total output of more than 17 million jin. The output of one season reached 90% of the total output for the entire year of 1958. Among them, more than 27,000 mu of low-yield fields generally increased production by more than 100% compared with 1958, and some even increased several times. More than 25,000 mu of low-yield fields have removed the low-yield label and entered the ranks of general high-yield fields. Looking at piles of golden grains on the threshing floor, people couldn't help but laugh happily from the bottom of their hearts. The People's Commune truly brought Golden Mountain to Xiaohuang. Some people said: "Seeing such a good harvest, if the eyebrows don't laugh, the beard will laugh too."
　　After the summer harvest, a new green appeared on the slopes of Xiaohuang Commune. This is something that people cannot find in their memories. In the past, after the early rice was harvested, the fields cracked, the rice stubble faced the sky, and tens of thousands of mu of fields would be idle until the following spring. Now, however, the slopes are full of water and green, and more than 28,000 mu of late rice have been planted. In 1958, the total late rice was only more than 100 mu. What a huge change this is! The remaining 20,000 mu of fields have also been planted with miscellaneous grain crops such as sweet potatoes and millet. They said: "In the past, it was all white, now it is all green. The autumn of 1959 is the same as spring!"

    人民公社搬来了波阳湖
    ——江西东乡小璜人民公社移山造海改造自然
    胡廷棠　刘捷　蔡方作
    江西省东乡县小璜人民公社，在1958年冬天到1959年春季，仅仅用了一百天的时间，就修起了两座能灌溉四万多亩稻田的大水库，解除了千百年来水旱灾害的威胁；1959年春天，又改造了大面积的低产田，使早稻一季的产量达到1958年全年总产量的90％，使这个历史上一贯缺粮的地区变成了余粮地区。社员们赞叹地说：“人民公社搬来了波阳湖，也搬来了黄金山。”
        辛酸的回忆
    水，小璜人民世世代代都渴望着。这里四面环山，丘陵起伏，方圆二百七十平方公里，既无湖泊，也无大的河流。晴了几天，焦黄的薄土就被晒透了；连下几天大雨，又到处是黄水滚滚，一片泥泞。
    由于缺水，这里的农民每年几乎要以三分之一的时间来车水，直到精疲力尽，塘涸沟干。由于缺水，农作物的产量低得可怜。
    水，在这里比生命都要宝贵！如今年老的人还清楚地记得有这样一桩事：清朝同治年间，莲塘和余家两个村的群众，在封建地主的指使和挑拨下，为一塘水的问题打了一场官司，一直打到总督衙门。总督没有办法，就叫人把一只烧得通红的铁靴拿到大堂之上，说：“哪个村有人敢出来穿上这只铁靴，就把水塘断给哪个村。”正在这紧张的时刻，莲塘村一个六十多岁的老农民于行可，毅然地走出人群，把自己的赤脚伸进烧红的铁靴，用生命换得了一口水塘的灌溉权。可是，一口塘又能灌溉多少田？人们在传诵着“行可公”的事迹时，总不免摇头叹息地说：“水比金子都贵，水就是命呀！要想日子好起来，除非把波阳湖搬来。”在当时，这只是一个不可实现的梦想。年年清明节，一些老农都要带着儿孙到“行可公”坟上烧香化纸，祈祷着风调雨顺。可是“行可公”死后无知，老天爷也没开恩，旱起来还是照样，严重时连人喝的水都很困难。
        美好的愿望
    解放后，小璜一带人民对旧有的三千多口“灯盏塘”、“碟子塘”进行了整修，同时修建了两百多座新的水利工程，扩大了灌溉面积一万多亩。在这个丘陵起伏、土质瘠薄的地区，第一次出现了灌田五百亩到一千亩的水利工程，破天荒地种上了一百多亩二季晚稻。但这些工程都比较小，全社七万多亩耕地，还有60％以上没有可靠的灌溉设施，遇上较长时间的干旱，农业生产仍然要受到严重的损失。
    过去，当人们走过横山和华山口时，看到这两个地方都是口小肚大，曾经这样幻想过：要是在山口上能再长出个山包来，把水挡住，山下这一带可就水旱无忧了。可是这毕竟是幻想，凭空怎么会长出个山包来呢？1956年实现高级合作化以后，大家就议论着要在这两处修建水库。水库修成后，就可以灌溉四万多亩田。这是多么令人向往的一桩大事情啊！可是几个社一商量，就难住了。第一，两座水库共要占田五千多亩。这将由谁来补偿？第二，要迁移四个村庄，二百九十三户人家，怎样安置？第三，要挖几十万土方，这么多的劳动力哪里来？第四，要投资几十万元，这笔钱从哪里出？当时一个高级社只不过两三百户，这样单薄的力量，哪里承担得了如此巨大的重担，计划很难实现。
    1958年，在全面大跃进形势的鼓舞下，小璜的人民比过去任何时候都更迫切地要求解决水利问题。因为水的问题不解决，车水的劳动力占得太多，就抽不出更多的劳动力去实行精耕细作，挖掘土地潜力，广开增产门路，发展多种经济。于是，他们不得不再次决定兴修横山水库。工程委员会成立了，各个乡的民工任务也分配了，可是珊壁乡的群众认为自己受益小，积极性不高；分配给余家乡的竹木任务，也同样得不到欢迎。修水库的事又不得不再一次搁下来了。
    广大社员从这些矛盾中，深深感到原来的小社已经不能适应生产力进一步发展的需要，迫切要求打破乡社界限，并小社为大社。1958年8月，各地建立人民公社的消息传到小璜后，群众欢声雷动，人心振奋，申请书从四面八方像雪片一样飞来。就这样，小璜、余家、珀?、珊壁四个乡三十五个农业社合并成立了小璜人民公社。
        搬来了波阳湖
    人民公社办事情，同从前大不一样。因为它有许多优越条件，说干就干，在成立公社的同一天，成立了横山、华山水利工程委员会。社员们都乐呵呵地说：“这是双喜临门。”的确，公社一成立，就显示了它的无比优越性。由于公社规模大，组织力量强，活动范围广，可以统一筹划全社生产和合理安排使用人力、物力、财力，原来修水库中遇到的那些难题，就都一一迎刃而解了。废掉的田，社里可以统一调剂，要迁出的人家，各大队可以分头妥善安置，劳动力可以全社统一调配，需要的投资公社也出得起。
    一场移山造海，征服自然的伟大斗争开始了。社员们发出了“依靠公社办水利，牵到龙王当马骑”的豪言壮语。全社有一万零五百多个男女劳动力，在公社的统一调配下，虽然抽出了三千多人炼钢铁，但因为有四千多妇女从繁琐家务劳动中解放出来后，勇敢地担当了全部秋收秋种任务，所以仍然能够抽调三千多名劳动力向水利进军。对于工程需要的物力、财力、技术力量，他们根据人民公社“一大二公”的特点，坚持自力更生的精神，提出了“钢筋自己打，木竹自己砍，工具自己造，水泥、石灰自己烧，技术力量自己培养，经费自己筹，炸药自己制，涵管自己做，石块自己开”的豪迈口号。这个口号提出后，真是无往不胜，无坚不摧。技术力量不足，公社就在工地上开办了一个训练班，培养了三十多名施工员。工程需要大量的水泥、石灰，就派了十二个社员到附近占圩公社去学烧水泥，派了一百名社员到本社的石灰矿上去烧石灰。缺钢筋，他们就在社员中收集废铁，抽调技术较高的铁工，用土炉铁锤打出了三千多斤钢筋。各队抽来的一百四十几名手工业工人，也在工地上建立了工厂，创制了二百三十节土火车、三十条木轨、四条空中索道，节约了四万多个劳动日。渠道上的涵管，原来计划用水泥，后来改用了自己砖瓦窑特制的瓦管。五座引水渡槽原来也计划用钢筋水泥，后来用木板、毛竹制成了，而这些木材、毛竹是由公社组织劳动力在余家大队砍的。
    这两座水库工程是相当艰巨的。共计有七十六万土石方，渠道全长达一百华里，要翻越五十多个山头，穿过二百多个山谷溪流，架设了一百八十节木制导洪管（长达三百八十米），有六十多座附属建筑，灌溉面积包括原来三十五个高级社范围内的四万多亩耕地。这样浩大艰巨的工程，只靠一个高级社单独的力量是无论如何也办不成的。而公社成立后，三千名劳动大军，依靠公社各方面物质力量的支援，日夜奋战了一百天，就胜利完成了两座水库的全部工程。
    横山水库放水的那一天，长长的渠道两旁站满了欢乐的人群。当清清的渠水在哗啦啦地奔流时，人们无法抑制自己心头的喜悦与激动。八十二岁的农民邹如和，沿着渠道整整走了八里路，边走边笑，笑得合不拢嘴。许多群众说：“过去多少朝代都没有解决的问题（水），人民公社一建立就很快地给办到了，一下子立下了大功，真是托毛主席的福！”有的说：“过去一熟都不保险，现在三熟也没有问题。”水，穿过山垅，穿过田坂，冲向二十里外的珊壁，飞向三十里外的下湖，四条蜿蜒曲折的干渠，就像两对美丽的龙须，灌溉着小璜四万多亩土地。过去人们常说：“要叫小璜有水，除非搬来波阳湖。”如今，依靠人民公社的力量，真正搬来了波阳湖。
      这里永远是春天
    水库建成了，给1959年的小璜带来了一个不平凡的春天。
    小璜公社共有早稻五万四千多亩，一季晚稻一万三千多亩。这些水田中，亩产百斤左右的低产田有二万七千多亩。低产的原因主要是水利条件不好，耕作粗放。现在水的问题解决了，过去用在抗旱上的大批劳动力可以腾出来了。据统计，全社1959年全年可节省二十万个劳动日，加上全社适当地调整了土地，消灭了六千多亩插花田，这也可节省很多劳动力，于是人们的注意力就转到这一大片低产田上来了。他们面对着这片低产田，信心百倍地说：“人民公社能够搬来波阳湖，也就能够搬来黄金山！”
    1959年春耕生产一开始，小璜公社就动员了千军万马投入了改造低产田的战斗。这在高级社时，这也是很难办到的。全社二十八个大队，组成了五十八支专业队伍，采取大兵团作战的办法，掀起了一个声势浩大的突击积肥送肥运动，给低产田下足了基肥，其中特别不好的田施的肥就更多，大部分低产田实行了三犁二耙一耥。还有一部分低产田，由于常遭山水冲刷，公社在发动大家改造低产田的同时，根据水土流失情况，全面作了规划，组织劳动力沿山作埂，山底开塘，防止水土流失，并在所有可能发生山水冲刷的地方，植树造林，以根除山水冲刷。
    低产田一般都离村庄较远，为了管理上的方便，公社党委第一书记徐顺喜首先在古老岗上搭起了第一座茅棚，把改造低产田的指挥部搬到低产坂上，日战田间，夜伴禾眠。接着各个低产坂上都陆续地出现了一幢又一幢的茅棚，连养猪厂、肥料厂也都先后上坂了。五十八个专业队伍，都在低产坂上扎下了营寨。这样一来，远田变成了近田，瘦田变成了肥田，低产田的禾苗紧紧地追逐着高产田的禾苗。社员们兴奋地说：“如今生产真是大变样了。”
    人民公社化后的第一个夏收，小璜出现了神话般的奇迹。全社五万零五百六十余亩早稻，总产量达到一千七百余万斤，一季产量就达到1958年全年总产量的90％。其中二万七千多亩低产田，普遍比1958年增产了一倍以上，有些甚至增加了好几倍。有二万五千亩低产田已摘掉了低产帽子，进入了一般高产田的行列。望着禾场上一堆堆金黄色的谷粒，人们忍不住从心里发出了欢乐的笑声，人民公社真正给小璜搬来了黄金山。有的群众说：“看到这样的好收成，眉毛不笑，胡子也要笑。”
    夏收以后，小璜公社的田坂上又出现了一片新绿。这是人们在记忆中找不到的事。以往，早稻收割后，田土开坼，禾蔸朝天，几万亩田便一直要闲到第二年春天。如今呢，满坂水汪汪地，绿油油地，种下了两万八千多亩晚稻，而1958年的晚稻总共只有一百多亩，这是多么巨大的变化呀！其余两万多亩田，也都种上了红薯、粟等杂粮作物。他们说：“过去一片白，现在一片青。1959年的秋天和春天一样！”
