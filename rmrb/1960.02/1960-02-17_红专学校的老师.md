Teachers of the Red and Expert School
Beijing Construction and Engineering Printing Factory, Liu Yi

I.

A crowd of people was gathered in front of the auditorium, looking at something. I squeezed in and saw that it was the announcement that the amateur Red and Expert School was about to open. I don't know which comrade wrote a poem next to the notice:

	Flowers are red because of the sun,
	People are red entirely because of the Party;
	The Red and Expert School is run by the Party,
	Go to school if you want to be red and expert.

Before I could squeeze out, Little Wang and his friends grabbed me and dragged me to sign up. On the way, they chattered away, one saying, "I'll take Chinese first, it's most useful for me as a typesetter." Another shouted, "I'll take algebra first, it's most useful for me who operates the machinery."

As for me, I hadn't thought about it. To be honest, I'm a strange person. I'm good at work, but I have no affinity for books. As soon as I pick one up, my eyelids start to droop.

Just then, they dragged me to the school entrance.

Hey, as soon as the principal saw me, he said, "Hey, Little Li, with you signing up, we won't have to worry about running this school well!"

Little Wang continued, "Little Li, in the past, we were neck and neck, no one could say anything about the other, but this semester, I want to challenge you to see who doesn't take leave and who learns well!"

I signed up. But I still didn't feel entirely happy and didn't plan to study to the end. Besides, I didn't even know if the teachers were any good!

II.

Strangely enough, Master Hou, who was most enthusiastic about going to school before, was now silent and didn't say a word. I couldn't figure out what was going on, so I asked Master Hou, "What are you taking?"

He lowered his eyelids and said, "Nothing!"

What was going on? I was very puzzled. Everyone knew how hard-working Master Hou was. You might think he's almost sixty years old, but I don't know where he gets his energy. I heard that when he was first liberated, he couldn't even recognize a few big characters, and he didn't even know which way the school door opened. But since liberation, this old man hasn't missed a minute of work, hasn't missed an assignment, and his grades are always excellent. He studies in the morning, studies at night, and even pulls out his dog-eared books for a few glances before going to bed at noon.

That day, I was learning how to make tables from Master Hou when Little Wang slowly strolled in. This "hothead" gave Master Hou a big envelope as soon as he came in and ran away without saying a word. Before leaving, he made a face at me, stuck out his tongue, and gave Master Hou a thumbs up.

Master Hou looked at the big envelope, shook his head, and put it into his pocket with slightly trembling hands.

As soon as we were off work, I went to play chess with Little Wang and asked him what was going on. Little Wang told me, "Master Hou has been hired as our junior high school Chinese teacher."

I didn't have much determination to study in the first place, and when I heard that Master Hou was our teacher, my heart sank. It's not that I was looking down on my master, it's just that I felt that someone who had never even stepped through the gates of a regular school, being a middle school teacher, was not a joke.

The more I thought about it, the more I felt something was wrong, so I didn't feel like playing chess and simply went to the school to withdraw my application. I'm just too simple-minded. As soon as I think of something bad, I can't think of the good side. I ran to the school office without thinking.

Principal Yang was busily tallying the numbers at his desk, his face beaming with joy, muttering to himself, "It's really amazing, 99.9% of the people have signed up." I opened the door with a creak, and the door rattled for a while. As soon as Principal Yang saw my panicked look, he guessed what was up. I said anxiously, "I'm not going!"

"Why? Tell me the reason!"

I couldn't say the reason, so I started to act unreasonable and said, "I'm not going, that's all, what reason is there?"

"If you don't say, I'll guess; okay! Is it because you think Master Hou's cultural level is low and he can't teach a student who has gone to junior high school like you?"

I was sweating profusely, my face burning as if being roasted by fire. When the principal saw that I was embarrassed, he came over and patted me on the shoulder with a smile and said, "Young man! Don't underestimate your master, everyone in the factory knows he's a living dictionary, how many units have praised the manuscripts he's typeset, he doesn't even let go of the typos and wrong punctuation marks in the original manuscript..."

The principal was really something, he persuaded me in every possible way and finally convinced my stubborn brain. I thought, isn't that right? No one can recognize the cursive writing in the original manuscript, but if you ask Master Hou, he's sure to recognize it. Besides, Master Hou is my master, it would be too outrageous for me to withdraw my application as soon as I heard that he was teaching us. Although I didn't withdraw my application, I still felt awkward in my heart.

III.

My family and Master Hou live in the same dormitory unit, and I can see Master Hou's recent situation clearly. He gets up at six o'clock every morning to practice Tai Chi, and when he comes back, he climbs onto the table to write lectures. When he comes home in the evening, he doesn't waste a minute, putting down his chopsticks and picking up a book. Seeing that my master is so old and still worrying about us young people, I feel a little bad. One day, I was helping my mother wash vegetables in the kitchen, and my master's wife praised me and said, "Little Li, your master is getting more and more hardworking, you have to learn from your master!"

"Auntie, don't you know? Master is going to be our Chinese teacher!"

When Master's wife heard this, she went back to the room with a thump and slammed the door shut. At first, she muttered something in a low voice, and then she started laughing and talking. I pretended to be chopping cabbage at the door, and I heard Master's wife laughing and saying in the room, "Hah, you're really something, you're getting more and more interesting as you get older. If it weren't for the Party's education, you, a blind man, would never have become a middle school teacher in your life!"

As the Red and Expert School was about to open, Master became even busier. He has dinner in the factory every day after work, and after dinner, he flips through this book and that magazine in the library. For several days in a row, he came home very late. Once, Master knocked on the door and woke me up. I looked at the watch, it was almost twelve o'clock. I don't know why, but I always feel that Master's face seems to be getting thinner day by day, and there are more red lines in the corners of his eyes.

On Saturday night, Little Wang and I were addicted to playing chess again, and we played until almost twelve o'clock at night without realizing it, and my eyelids wouldn't listen, so I went home. As soon as I came out of the club's gate, wow, the snow was so thick, covering the road tightly. The snow was still falling and falling, and the wind was blowing hard, shaking the big willows. Every step left a deep footprint. As soon as I walked into the doorway of the dormitory, I suddenly heard the voice of an old man. I listened carefully and it was Master's voice:

"This news is like a warm current passing through people's hearts, and glory and happiness radiate from people's faces..."

Isn't this a lesson in junior high school Chinese? Oh, I understand, Master is preparing for the lesson here. I covered my frozen ears, my heart was pounding, and I thought, Master is so old, he's still worrying about us young people in the middle of the night, who would I be worthy of if I didn't study hard!

IV.

On the day of the opening of school, Master came the earliest. He swept the floor clean while the students hadn't arrived, dusted the tables until they were smooth and shiny, and wiped the blackboard until it was spotless.

When the class started, I looked at Master's bright eyes, my heart was pounding, and my face was burning, as if I had done something wrong to Master.

In this class, Master talked to everyone as if he was chatting: "My family was very poor when I was young, and I couldn't afford to go to school. Thanks to the liberation, the Party opened my eyes. I always feel that I wouldn't be worthy of the Party if I didn't study hard..." Then he said with infinite emotion: "A young idler, an old beggar; when you get to my age, you will taste the bitterness of regretting not studying when you need it. While you are young, have good brains, and good conditions, seize the time to study!"

I was very moved by this class, and it also opened my mind. After class, I wrote a big-character poster:

	Teacher Hou, you spoke well,
	Made my heart burn,
	Improve ideology and culture together,
	Thank the Party's good leadership.

### 红专学校的老师

    红专学校的老师
    北京建工印刷厂　柳毅
    一
    大礼堂门口，里三层，外三层，围了一大堆人在看什么。我挤进去一看，原来是业余红专学校要开学的消息。不知是哪位同志，还在布告旁边配上了一首诗：
        花红靠太阳，
        人红全凭党；
        红专学校党来办，
        要红要专上学堂。
    还没等我挤出去，小王他们哥几个就把我揪住，硬拉着我去报名。半路上，他们唧唧喳喳的议论开了，这个说：“我先上语文，语文对我这个排字工最有用。”那个嚷：“我先上代数，代数对我这掌握机器的人最有用。”
    至于我，还没想过哩。说起来我这个人哪，也够奇怪，干活还行，可就是跟书本没有缘份，我一拿起它来呀，眼皮子就往一块凑。
    正在这当儿，他们就把我拉到了学校门口。
    嗬，校长一见我，就开了口：“嘿，小李子呀，有你报名，我们这个学校就不愁办不好啦！”
    小王接着就说：“小李子，过去咱俩是半斤八两，谁也别说谁，可这一学期，我要向你挑战，看谁不请假，谁学得好！”
    我算是报上了名。可心里还不大痛快，也没打算学到底。再说，老师好坏还不知道哩！
    二
    说也奇怪，本来张罗上学最凶的侯师傅，怎么这一回却闷着个头一声不吭了。我弄不清是怎么回事，就问侯师傅：“你上什么？”
    他把眼皮子一拉说：“什么也不上！”
    这是怎么回事？我挺纳闷的，谁不知道我们侯师傅那股用功的劲头儿。你别看他今年快六十啦，可是不知他打哪里来的那股冲劲儿，听人说，他刚解放那年，斗大的字也认不得一升，连学校的门朝哪边开的，他都不知道。可是，打解放以来，这个老头儿，没缺过一分钟的勤，没欠过一次作业，成绩总是五分。早晨学，晚上学，中午连睡觉前还掏出四面都卷了边的书瞅上几眼。
    这天，我正跟侯师傅学做表格，小王慢慢悠悠的来了。这个“楞头青”一进门就把个大信封给侯师傅，一声不吭地就跑了。临走时还朝着我弄了个鬼脸，伸了伸舌头，指着侯师傅伸一伸大拇指头。
    侯师傅看了看那个大信封，摇了摇脑袋，粗大的双手有点颤颤抖抖地揣到兜里去了。
    一下了班，我就去找小王下棋，顺便问问到底是怎么回事，小王跟我说：“侯师傅被聘为我们初中语文的教师。”
    我本来对学习就没有决心，一听说侯师傅是我们的教员，心就凉了半截子。不是我门缝里看人把师傅瞧扁了，实在我觉得师傅用功是用功，学问的确也不坏，可是我老觉得一个连正规学校的门坎也没迈过的人，当中学教员可不是闹着玩儿的事情。
    我越想越不对劲，也就没心思下棋啦，干脆到学校去打退堂鼓，撤回我的报名单。我这个人哪，脑袋瓜就是太简单，一想到不好的事儿，我就想不到好的一面，我不管三七二十一地就跑到校部去。
    校长老杨正在办公桌上噼啦吧啦地统计人数，脸上乐得像开了花，不住地自己跟自己说：“真不简单，99．9％的人报了名。”我吱呀一下子就把门拉开，门叮叮当当地响了一阵子。老杨一看我这份慌张样儿，就猜着了个八九不离十。我着急地说：“不上啦！”
    “为什么？你说一说原因吧！”
    我这个原因，哪能说出口，就来他个胡搅蛮缠地说：“不上就是不上，还有什么原因。”
    “你不说，我猜猜看；好吧！是不是嫌侯师傅文化水平低，教不了你这个上过初中的学生啊！”
    我满头大汗，脸火辣辣地像叫火烤的那么难受。校长一看我不好意思了，就过来拍了拍我的肩膀满脸笑容地说：“小伙子呀！你可不要小看你师傅啊，全厂谁不知道他是个活字典，他排过的稿子，有多少单位表扬过，连原稿上的错别字，错标点符号，他都不放过……”
    校长可真有两下子，他好说歹说，总算把我这个木头疙瘩的脑袋瓜说活了。我一想，可不是吗？原稿上写得草的字，谁都认不出来，找侯师傅，准保认得出。再说，侯师傅又是我的师傅，我一听说是他教我们就撤回报名单，也太不像话。报名单虽然没撤回，可是我的心里老是觉得别别扭扭的。
    三
    我的家和侯师傅住在一个宿舍的单元里，侯师傅近来的情况我看得清清楚楚。他每天早晨六点钟就起来练一回太极拳，回来就爬在桌子上写讲义。晚上回家，连一分钟的工夫也不放过，放下筷子，就拿起书本。我看我师傅这么大岁数，还为了我们年轻人这么操心，心就有点过不去。有一天，我在厨房里帮助妈妈洗菜，我的师母跟我夸奖说：“小李子，你师傅越来越用功啦，你可得跟你师傅学学啊！”
    “师母，你还不知道吗？师傅要当我们的语文老师啦！”
    师母一听这话，腾腾地就回屋啦，一进门嘭地就把门关了起来。开始时还小声地嘀咕一阵子什么，后来就是有说有笑。我装着在门口捣白菜，只听得师母在屋里一边笑一边说：“吓，真有你的，越老越有意思。要不是党的教育，你这睁眼瞎子，哪辈子能当上中学教员！”
    眼看着红专学校快开学，师傅也就更忙了。他每天下了班就在工厂里吃晚饭，吃完饭就在图书馆翻翻这本书，翻翻那本杂志。一连几天，回家都很晚。有一次师傅叫门，把我给吵醒了，看看表，快十二点了。不知怎的，我总觉得师傅的脸好像一天比一天瘦了，眼角上的红丝也多了。
    星期六的晚上，我和小王下棋又上了瘾，不知不觉地就下到夜里快十二点，眼皮子也不听使唤了，就回家了。一出俱乐部的大门，好家伙，什么时候雪下得这么厚，把马路盖得严严实实的。雪还哗哗啦啦一个劲儿地下，风呼呼地猛吹，刮得大柳树直晃，走一步就留下一个很深的脚印。刚走到宿舍的那个门洞里，冷不防听到有个老头儿说话的声音，我仔细一听，是师傅的嗓门：
    “这消息像一股暖流一样的通过人们的心，人们的脸上放射出光荣和幸福的光彩……”
    这不是初中语文里的一课吗？噢，我明白了，原来是师傅在这里备课。我捂了捂冻得发硬的耳朵，心通通地直跳，心想，师傅这么大的年纪了，深更半夜，还为我们这些青年人操心，我再不好好学习，对得起谁！
    四
    开课那天，师傅来得最早，他趁学生们都没有来的当儿，把地扫得干干净净，把桌子撢得流光水滑，把黑板擦得净光瓦亮。
    上课了，我一看师傅那一双炯炯有光的眼睛，心就扑通扑通地直跳，脸就火辣辣的，好像做了什么对不起师傅的事情似的。
    这一堂课，师傅像和大伙聊天似的：“我从小家里很穷，上不起学堂，多亏解放了，党把我的眼睛打开了，自己老觉得不好好学习，哪对得起党……”紧接着他无限感慨地说：“少壮不努力，老大徒伤悲，到了我这么大的岁数，你们就会尝到书到用时方恨少的滋味了。趁你们年青脑筋好，条件好，抓紧时间学学吧！”
    这堂课我听了很感动，也把我这个脑袋瓜给捅开了。下课以后，我就写了一张大字报：
    侯老师，讲得好，
    说得我心眼直发烧，
    思想文化齐提高，
    感谢党的好领导。
