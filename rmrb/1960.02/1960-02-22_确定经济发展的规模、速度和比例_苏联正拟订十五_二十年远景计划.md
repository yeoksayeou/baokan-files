Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 21st: According to the Soviet "Planned Economy" magazine this year's first issue, entrusted by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the State Planning Committee of the Soviet Council of Ministers is currently drafting a general long-range plan for the development of the Soviet national economy for a period of fifteen to twenty years, based on the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU.

Participating in this work are: the State Planning Committees of various Union Republics, relevant departments of the Soviet government, the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the Academies of Sciences of various Union Republics, scientific research institutes and design institutes, as well as the most famous scientists and practical workers in the country.

The First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee and Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, said in a speech at the All-Union Power Conference on November 28 last year that the Soviet Union's fifteen to twenty-year long-range plan for the development of the national economy "should become the main axis of the program for the construction of communism in the Soviet Union."

In order to formulate this long-term long-range plan, the Soviet State Planning Committee convened a meeting on December 28 last year under the chairmanship of Kosygin, Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers and Chairman of the State Planning Committee. At the meeting, reports were heard from V. A. Maksudov, Deputy Chairman of the State Committee for Science and Technology of the Soviet Council of Ministers, on "The Road of Technological Development in the Fifteen to Twenty Year Long-Range Plan," from Academician Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, on "The Direction of Scientific Development in the Long-Range Plan," from A. G. Antropov, Minister of Geology and Mineral Resources Protection of the Soviet Union, on "The Estimation of Important Mineral Deposits and Material Raw Material Bases in the Soviet Union," and from V. I. Ivanov, Deputy Chairman of the Soviet State Planning Committee, on "The Speed Proportion and Other Important Indicators of the Development of the Soviet National Economy during the General Long-Range Plan."

At present, the Soviet State Planning Committee is conducting preliminary calculations to determine the possible production scale, speed, and basic proportions of Soviet economic development within fifteen to twenty years. This calculation is based on the main tasks put forward by the 21st Congress of the CPSU. These main tasks are: to establish the material and technical foundation of communism, to solve the basic economic task of the Soviet Union—to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita product output and to ensure that the lives of the Soviet people reach the highest level in the world.

The most important issues in the fifteen to twenty year general long-range plan for the development of the Soviet national economy are: the complete electrification of the Soviet Union, the chemicalization of the national economy, the complete mechanization and automation of the production process, the rational allocation of productive forces, ensuring the most effective use of natural and labor resources, the development of science and technology, the comprehensive development of the economy and culture of various republics and economic zones, carrying out communist education, and improving labor productivity and people's living standards.

The Soviet State Planning Committee has established various specialized committees, which are currently studying these issues in detail with relevant agencies.

    确定经济发展的规模、速度和比例
    苏联正拟订十五——二十年远景计划
    新华社莫斯科21日电　据苏联“计划经济”杂志今年第一期报道，受苏联共产党中央委员会委托，苏联部长会议国家计划委员会目前正在根据苏共第二十一次代表大会的决议制订为期十五年到二十年的苏联国民经济发展总远景的方案。
    参加这一工作的有：各加盟共和国的国家计划委员会，苏联政府各有关部门，苏联科学院，各加盟共和国科学院，科学研究所和设计院，以及全国最著名的科学家和实际工作人员。
    苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫去年11月28日在全苏动力会议上讲话时曾说，苏联十五年到二十年发展国民经济的远景计划，“应当成为苏联共产主义建设纲领的主轴”。
    为了制定这一长期远景计划，去年12月28日，苏联国家计划委员会在苏联部长会议副主席、国家计划委员会主席柯西金主持下召开了会议，会上听取了苏联部长会议国家科学技术委员会副主席马克萨烈夫“关于十五年到二十年远景计划中发展技术的道路”的报告、苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫“关于远景计划中发展科学的方向”的报告、苏联地质和矿藏保护部部长安特罗波夫“关于苏联重要矿藏和物质原料基地的估计”的报告和苏联国家计划委员会副主席伊万诺夫“关于总远景计划期间苏联国民经济发展的速度比例和其他重要指标”的报告。
    目前，苏联国家计划委员会正在进行初步计算，以便确定在十五年到二十年内苏联经济发展的可能达到的生产规模、速度和基本比例。这种计算是依据苏共第二十一次代表大会提出的当前主要任务进行的。这些主要任务是：建立共产主义的物质技术基础，解决苏联的基本经济任务——在按人口计算的产品产量上赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家和保证苏联人民的生活达到世界上最高的水平。
    苏联国民经济发展十五年到二十年总远景计划中最重要的问题是：实现苏联全国完全电气化、国民经济的化学化、以及生产过程的全盘机械化和自动化，合理配置生产力，保证最有效地利用自然资源和劳动资源，发展科学技术，全面发展各共和国和各经济区的经济和文化，进行共产主义教育，提高劳动生产率和人民生活水平等。
    苏联国家计划委员会已经成立了各种专门委员会，它们目前正同有关机构详细研究这些问题。
