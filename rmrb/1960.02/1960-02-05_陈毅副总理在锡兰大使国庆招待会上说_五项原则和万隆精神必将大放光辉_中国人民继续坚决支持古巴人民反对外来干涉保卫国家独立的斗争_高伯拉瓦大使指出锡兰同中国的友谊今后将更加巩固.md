Xinhua News Agency, February 4th - Ceylon's Ambassador to China, Gooneratne, held a grand reception this evening to celebrate the twelfth anniversary of Ceylon's independence.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke at the reception, extending warm congratulations to the government and people of Ceylon on behalf of the Chinese government and people. He said that the Chinese government and people attach great importance to the positive role played by Ceylon in international affairs. In recent years, Ceylon has adhered to a policy of non-alignment, peace, and neutrality, making beneficial contributions to promoting Asian-African solidarity and safeguarding world peace. We sincerely hope that in the new year, the government and people of Ceylon will achieve even greater accomplishments in these areas.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi said that since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Ceylon, our two countries have always maintained friendly relations, and our mutually beneficial trade has brought benefits to both sides. This friendly cooperative relationship has seen new development in the past year. Exchanges between government and non-governmental delegations between our two countries have been continuous, and the 1960 trade protocol will soon be signed. In particular, the signing of the China-Ceylon Air Transport Agreement last year will not only bring our two countries closer geographically but will also promote better mutual understanding between the peoples of the two countries. The friendship between our two countries will surely be further consolidated and developed in the years to come.

    He said that the Chinese government and people have always maintained friendly relations with Asian countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit. Developments since last year have proven that although some temporary twists and turns have occurred in relations with certain Asian countries, the friendship between the peoples of Asian countries cannot be undermined by any force. Some problems that exist between certain Asian countries can be resolved fairly and reasonably as long as they all proceed from a friendly desire and adhere to the method of peaceful consultation. The recent signing of the "Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression" and the "Sino-Burmese Agreement on Boundary Issues" is a good illustration of this. We firmly believe that the Five Principles and the Bandung Spirit will surely break through the temporary clouds and shine brilliantly, and the unity of the Asian peoples will surely stand the test of time and become increasingly close.

    He said that we are pleased to see that the national independence movement in Africa and the national democratic movement in Latin America continue to achieve new victories. The recent holding of the Second All-African People's Conference and the various resolutions passed by the Conference show that the African people's struggle for national independence is entering a higher stage of development. The victory of the Cuban national revolution and the great achievements made by the Cuban people in safeguarding independence and carrying out democratic reforms have had an increasing impact on the struggle of the peoples of Latin American countries against foreign control and for democracy. Precisely because of this, the United States has never relaxed its interference in the Cuban revolution and has recently intensified its planning for direct armed intervention. The Chinese people will, together with the people of the world, continue to resolutely support the Cuban people's heroic struggle against foreign interference and to defend national independence, and believe that the just cause of the Cuban people will surely achieve greater victories.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi concluded by saying that the Chinese people will continue to work together with Ceylon and other Asian and African countries to maintain world peace and develop our respective economies.

    Ambassador Gooneratne spoke at the beginning of the reception. He said that the Ceylonese government and people are constantly implementing plans to develop our social order in a way that best suits our own social and economic background. The Ambassador said that in our foreign policy, we continue to follow the spirit and principles of the Bandung Resolutions. We believe in these principles and have done our utmost to see that they are realized not only between Asian and African countries, but also in the international family.

    The Ambassador was pleased to point out that Ceylon's traditional close relations with the People's Republic of China have achieved new successes. Last year, two ministerial delegations visited China at the invitation of the Chinese government. The delegation led by the Minister of Transport signed an air transport agreement establishing an air route between China and Ceylon. At the end of last year, a trade delegation renegotiated the trade protocol under the 1957 trade agreement, which will soon be formally signed in Beijing. We believe that through our joint efforts, this friendship will be further consolidated in the future.

    The Ambassador concluded by saying that in these momentous years, we are fortunate to be in China. We have celebrated with you the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Republic. This is no ordinary anniversary, because we have all witnessed the significant achievements you have made in such a short period of time. These achievements are all the more remarkable, especially considering the size of your country and the scope of the problems you face. We recently learned that you have completed most of the targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. Let us congratulate you and wish you continued success.

    The speeches of Vice Premier Chen Yi and Ambassador Gooneratne were warmly welcomed. After their speeches, the band played the national anthems of China and Ceylon respectively.

    Also present at this evening's reception were Vice Premier of the State Council Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Chen Shutong, Panchen Erdeni Chökyi Gyaltsen, Lin Feng, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Burhan Shahidi, Pagbalha Geleg Namgyal, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Geng Biao, as well as people from all walks of life in China.

    Envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries to China also attended the reception.

    陈毅副总理在锡兰大使国庆招待会上说
    五项原则和万隆精神必将大放光辉
    中国人民继续坚决支持古巴人民反对外来干涉保卫国家独立的斗争
    高伯拉瓦大使指出锡兰同中国的友谊今后将更加巩固
    新华社4日讯　锡兰驻中国大使高伯拉瓦今晚举行盛大招待会，庆祝锡兰独立十二周年。
    国务院副总理陈毅在招待会上讲话，代表中国政府和人民向锡兰政府和人民表示热烈的祝贺。他说，中国政府和人民十分重视锡兰在国际事务中所起的良好作用。这些年来，锡兰坚持不结盟的和平中立政策，对于促进亚非团结和维护世界和平，作出了有益的贡献。我们热诚地希望，在新的一年中，锡兰政府和人民将会在这些方面取得更大的成就。
    陈毅副总理说，自从中锡建交以来，我们两国始终保持了友好的关系，我们两国间平等互利的贸易为双方带来了好处。这种友好合作关系，在过去一年中又有了新的发展。我们两国间政府和民间代表团的来往不断，1960年度的贸易议定书不久即将签字，特别是去年中锡航空运输协定的签订不仅将使我们两国在地理上更加接近，而且将促使两国人民更好地相互了解。我们两国的友谊在今后的年月里必将进一步巩固和发展。
    他说，中国政府和人民一向根据和平共处五项原则和万隆精神，同亚洲各国友好相处。去年以来的发展证明，尽管在某些亚洲国家的关系上出现了一些暂时的曲折，但是，亚洲各国人民间的友谊是任何力量也破坏不了的，某些亚洲国家相互间存在的一些问题，只要彼此都从友好的愿望出发，坚持和平协商的方法，是可以得到公平合理的解决的。最近我国和缅甸签订了“中缅友好和互不侵犯条约”和“中缅关于两国边界问题的协定”就是一个很好的说明。我们深信，五项原则和万隆精神必将冲破一时的乌云而大放光辉，亚洲各国人民的团结一定能够经得起时间的考验而日趋紧密。
    他说，我们高兴地看到，非洲的民族独立运动和拉丁美洲的民族民主运动继续取得了新的胜利。最近第二届全非人民大会的举行和大会所通过的各项决议，说明非洲人民争取民族独立的斗争正在进入一个更高的发展阶段。古巴民族革命的胜利和古巴人民在维护独立和进行民主改革方面所取得的巨大成就，对于拉丁美洲各国人民反对外来控制和争取民主的斗争产生了越来越大的影响。正因如此，美国从未放松过对古巴革命的干涉，最近更加紧策划直接武装干涉的阴谋活动。中国人民将同全世界人民一起，继续坚决支持古巴人民反对外来干涉、保卫国家独立的英勇斗争，并且相信古巴人民的正义事业一定能够取得更大的胜利。
    陈毅副总理最后说，中国人民将继续同锡兰和其它亚非国家一起，为维护世界和平和发展各自的经济，进行共同的努力。
    高伯拉瓦大使在招待会开始的时候讲了话。他说，锡兰政府和人民不断地用最适合于我们自己的社会和经济背景的方法来执行发展我国的社会秩序的计划。大使说，在我国的外交政策方面，我们继续遵循了万隆决议的精神和原则。我们信仰这些原则，同时尽了我们的最大努力，使这些原则不仅在亚非国家之间，而且也在国际大家庭中得到实现。
    大使高兴地指出，锡兰同中华人民共和国的传统的亲密关系有了新的成就。去年有两个部长级的代表团应中国政府的邀请访问了中国。由运输部长率领的代表团签订了一个建立锡中航线的航空运输协定。去年年底，一个贸易代表团根据1957年贸易协定重订了贸易议定书，不久将在北京正式签字。我们相信，通过我们的共同努力，这种友谊在今后将更加巩固。
    大使最后说，在这些具有重大意义的岁月里，我们能在中国，感到很幸运。我们曾同你们一起欢度了共和国成立十周年。这不是一个普通的周年纪念日，因为我们都亲眼看到，你们在这样短的时期内取得了重大的成就。尤其是考虑到贵国的面积之大和你们所面临的问题的范围之大，这些成就就更加值得称道。不久前我们得知，你们提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的绝大部分指标。让我们庆贺你们，并且祝你们不断地取得胜利。
    陈毅副总理和高伯拉瓦大使的讲话，受到了热烈的欢迎。在他们讲话以后，乐队分别奏起中国和锡兰两国的国歌。
    出席今晚招待会的，还有国务院副总理习仲勋，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长陈叔通、班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞、林枫，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席包尔汉、帕巴拉·卓列朗杰，国防委员会副主席张治中，外交部副部长章汉夫、耿飚，以及中国各方面的人士。
    各国驻中国的使节和外交官员也出席了招待会。
