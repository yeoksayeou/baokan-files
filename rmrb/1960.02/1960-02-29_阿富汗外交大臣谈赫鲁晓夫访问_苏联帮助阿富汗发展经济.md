Xinhua News Agency, February 28th. According to a TASS report: Afghan Foreign Minister Mohammed Naim Khan stated at a press conference on the 27th that during Soviet Minister Council Chairman Khrushchev's visit to Afghanistan, all issues of mutual interest will be discussed. He said that Khrushchev's visit to Afghanistan is another step in expanding the friendly relations between these two neighboring countries.

Naim Khan said that Afghanistan is constructing many engineering projects with Soviet technical and economic assistance, and these projects will help Afghanistan complete its five-year plan for developing the national economy.

A reporter asked him if Afghanistan and the United States held negotiations on the issue of providing Afghanistan with military aid during Eisenhower's visit to Kabul. Naim Khan replied that no such negotiations were held. He emphasized, "We do not request such aid. As for economic aid, we express our willingness to accept it, if such aid is not attached with any conditions. American aid is attached with political conditions, such as requiring Afghanistan to participate in military treaties. However, we cannot accept such conditions. The Afghan government pursues a policy of neutrality and non-participation in any bloc."

    阿富汗外交大臣谈赫鲁晓夫访问
    苏联帮助阿富汗发展经济
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社消息：阿富汗外交大臣穆罕默德·纳伊姆汗27日在记者招待会上说，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫访问阿富汗期间，将讨论双方感到兴趣的所有的问题。他说，赫鲁晓夫访问阿富汗是扩大这两个邻国友好关系的又一步骤。
    纳伊姆汗说，阿富汗在苏联的技术和经济援助下建设许多工程项目，这些项目将帮助阿富汗完成发展国民经济的五年计划。
    记者问他，在艾森豪威尔访问喀布尔期间，阿富汗和美国之间有否就给予阿富汗军事援助问题举行谈判。纳伊姆汗回答说，没有举行过这种谈判。他强调指出，“我们不请求这种援助。至于经济援助，我们表示愿意接受，如果这种援助不附带任何条件的话。美国的援助附带政治条件，例如，要阿富汗参加军事条约。但是，这种条件我们不能接受。阿富汗政府奉行中立和不参加任何集团的政策。”
