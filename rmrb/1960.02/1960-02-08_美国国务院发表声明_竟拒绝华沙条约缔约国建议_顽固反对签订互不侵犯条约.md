Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 6th - The U.S. State Department yesterday issued a statement on the Warsaw Treaty Conference declaration, once again unreasonably rejecting the proposal made by the Warsaw Treaty member states to sign a non-aggression treaty between the Warsaw Treaty Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

    The statement, issued by State Department Press Officer White, said that the United States believes that "it is bound by an obligation undertaken when signing the United Nations Charter, which is not to resort to force to resolve international disputes." But the statement rejected the proposal made by the Warsaw Treaty member states to sign a non-aggression treaty.

    The State Department's statement concealed its aggressive intentions, saying that "the United States participates in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other regional defense organizations out of the belief that this organization of free world countries has successfully demonstrated that aggression has no hope of succeeding, thereby helping to achieve this goal." The statement deliberately spread suspicion about the Soviet Union's peaceful intentions and distorted the fact, saying that "the Warsaw Treaty Organization repeatedly stated in its declaration that the Soviet Union may take unilateral action against Germany (i.e., if efforts to conclude a peace treaty with the two Germanys do not receive support, the Warsaw Treaty participants will conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic together with other countries willing to conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic – Xinhua Editor)" is supposedly "irreconcilable" with the Soviet Union's declared peaceful intentions.

    美国国务院发表声明
    竟拒绝华沙条约缔约国建议
    顽固反对签订互不侵犯条约
    新华社6日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院昨天就华沙条约会议宣言发表声明，再次无理拒绝华沙条约缔约国提出的关于华沙条约组织和北大西洋公约组织之间签订互不侵犯条约的建议。
    由国务院新闻发布官怀特发表的这项声明说，美国认为，“它自己是受在联合国宪章上签字时所承担的一项义务的约束的，这就是不依靠武力来解决国际争端”。但是声明却拒绝华沙条约缔约国提出的签订互不侵犯条约的建议。
    国务院的声明掩饰它的侵略意图说，“美国参加北大西洋公约组织和其他区域性防务组织，是从这样一个信念出发，即由于自由世界国家的这种组织成功地表明侵略没有希望得逞，从而有助于实现这个目标。”声明对苏联的和平意图故意散布怀疑，并且歪曲说，“华沙条约组织在它的宣言中一再声称苏联可能对德国采取单独行动的做法（即如果同两个德国缔结和约的努力得不到支持，华沙条约参加国将跟其他愿意同德意志民主共和国缔结和约的国家一道，同德意志民主共和国缔结和约——新华社编者）”，是同苏联所宣布的和平意图所谓“难调和的”。
