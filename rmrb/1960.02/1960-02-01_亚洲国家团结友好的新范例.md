    The Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Sino-Burmese Agreement on Boundary Issues were announced today. These are significant achievements made by the Chinese and Burmese governments through friendly consultations under the guidance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This treaty and agreement not only mark a new stage in the good-neighborly relations between China and Burma, but also set a new example for friendly cooperation and peaceful coexistence among Asian countries.
    The Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression is a treaty of peace. In this treaty, China and Burma have enshrined the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which they jointly advocated, in treaty form. The treaty stipulates that both contracting parties recognize and respect each other's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. This is the norm of international relations. Without such recognition and respect, any normal international relations are impossible. The treaty also stipulates that both contracting parties guarantee to resolve all disputes between them through peaceful consultation and without resorting to force. This is a major principle of peaceful coexistence. Both China and Burma are peace-loving countries, and it is in the highest interests of both countries to resolve all disputes between them amicably through peaceful consultation, rather than by resorting to force. There are no fundamental conflicts of interest between China and Burma, and there is no problem that cannot be resolved through consultation. The treaty also stipulates that both contracting parties guarantee mutual non-aggression and will not participate in any military alliance directed against the other party. This provision has great significance. Because at present, U.S. imperialism is trying to expand its aggressive military blocs, this is a major blow to the U.S. conspiracy to create antagonism between Asian countries. The treaty also stipulates that both contracting parties will, in the spirit of friendly cooperation, develop and strengthen economic and cultural ties between the two countries in accordance with the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. China and Burma have suffered common oppression and exploitation by imperialism in the past, and both countries are very backward economically and culturally. The common desire of the people of both countries is to end this backwardness as soon as possible, help each other in developing their own economies and cultures, and seek common prosperity. It can be seen that the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression is a further development of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and is in the interests of the people of both countries and of peace in Asia.
    The Sino-Burmese Agreement on Boundary Issues was concluded under the guidance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, in order to promote a comprehensive solution to the Sino-Burmese boundary issue and to consolidate and further develop Sino-Burmese friendship. There has long been a boundary issue between China and Burma. Most of the middle and southern sections of the national boundary between the two countries were delineated by China and Britain in two treaties signed in 1894 and 1897 and an exchange of notes in 1941. However, the following boundary issues still exist between the two countries: First, the entire northern section of the national boundary between the two countries (from Gaoligong Mountain to the western end of the Sino-Burmese boundary) is an undefined boundary that needs to be formally delineated. Second, in this undefined boundary section, the three villages of Pianma, Gulang, and Kangfang, which belong to China, were gradually occupied by British troops from 1905 to 1911 and should be returned to China. Third, according to the Sino-British Boundary Treaty of 1897, the Meng-Mao Triangular Area, located at the confluence of the Nawan River and the Ruili River and belonging to China, was designated as a "perpetual lease" area of British Burma. This "perpetual lease" is not in line with the current friendly and equal relations between China and Burma and needs to be abolished. Fourth, the section of the boundary delineated by the Sino-British Exchange of Notes in 1941 has unreasonable aspects, and this section of the boundary has not yet been demarcated and boundary markers have not been erected. From 1954, the Chinese and Burmese governments began to contact each other on the boundary issue. Due to the sincere desire of both sides to resolve boundary disputes through peaceful negotiations and establish a peaceful and friendly boundary, the views of both sides gradually converged after several meetings and correspondence between the leaders of the two countries. This time, after talks between the Prime Ministers of the two countries, an agreement on boundary issues was finally concluded, principled agreements were reached on the various specific issues existing on the boundary between the two countries, and it was decided to establish a joint committee to resolve the various specific issues existing, carry out demarcation and erect boundary markers, and draft a Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty in accordance with these principled agreements. In Article 2 of the agreement, both parties agreed that the entire undefined boundary from Gaoligong Mountain to the western end of the Sino-Burmese boundary, with the exception of the Pianma, Gulang, and Kangfang areas, should be delimited in accordance with the traditional customary line. At the same time, the Burmese side agreed to return to China the Chinese territories of Pianma, Gulang, and Kangfang, which had been occupied by British troops in the past, which provided a clear principle for resolving the northern section of the boundary between the two countries. We welcome the fair and friendly attitude of the Burmese government, which has no intention of inheriting the products of imperialist aggression and believes that it "should not retain what it does not own." Regarding the Meng-Mao Triangular Area, the Chinese government, considering that the road built by Burma here is the lifeline connecting the Shan and Kachin states of Burma and that this area is relatively important to Burma, agreed to transfer this area to Burma, making it part of Burmese territory. In exchange, the Burmese government agreed to cede the areas under the jurisdiction of the Panhung and Panlao tribes west of the 1941 Line to China, making them part of Chinese territory, thereby correcting the unreasonable state of affairs in which these two tribes were originally divided into Chinese and Burmese parts by the 1941 Line. In this way, all the specific issues existing on the Sino-Burmese boundary have been resolved in principle. In addition, the Sino-British Exchange of Notes in 1941 stipulated that China had the right to operate mining enterprises in Lufang, Burma. This provision is detrimental to Burmese sovereignty; and for socialist China, it is also inconceivable to maintain this privileged right. Therefore, our country declares its abandonment of this right.
    The signing of the Sino-Burmese Agreement on Boundary Issues fully demonstrates the common desire of the governments and peoples of China and Burma to get rid of the nets imposed on the two countries by imperialism and to get along with each other in a friendly manner on a new basis. Although the specific survey and delimitation of the boundary still requires some work by the joint committee established in accordance with the agreement, since the guiding principles for resolving the problem have been determined, as long as both parties adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the entire boundary issue can be resolved fairly, reasonably, and mutually beneficially through friendly consultation. The signing of the Sino-Burmese Agreement on Boundary Issues has paved the way for the final and comprehensive resolution of the boundary issues left over from history.
    The signing of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Agreement on Boundary Issues between the two countries is a major achievement of our country's unremitting implementation of a peaceful foreign policy. At the same time, this is also inseparable from the attitude of the Burmese government in adhering to the Five Principles and friendly consultation. We very much agree with what Prime Minister Ne Win said at the farewell banquet, "This is due, on the one hand, to the political vision of the governments of the two countries, and on the other hand, to the Five Principles based on peaceful coexistence."
    The Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression is the first such peace treaty between Asian countries. The Sino-Burmese Agreement on Boundary Issues is an example of the rational resolution of boundary disputes between Asian countries. This treaty and agreement have great historical significance. Asian countries have all suffered from the plunder and oppression of imperialism and colonialism, and the Asian people have a common goal of opposing colonialism and imperialism. In the face of brutal and cunning aggressors, what we need is unity, mutual sympathy, and support. Only in this way can we completely smash the imperialist conspiracy to sow discord and enslave Asian countries, strive for and safeguard national independence, and use our strength for peaceful construction, and change the state of economic and cultural backwardness caused by imperialist and colonialist aggression as soon as possible. The treaty and agreement concluded between China and Burma precisely reflect this common fundamental interest of the people of China and Burma. This fact itself powerfully proves that Asian countries should not only, but also can, unite in friendship and coexist peacefully, thus bringing great encouragement to the people of Asian countries.
    In sharp contrast to the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression is the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty signed in Washington not long ago. Through this treaty, the United States has turned Japan into a forward base for aggression, revived Japanese militarism, and made the people of China, the Soviet Union, and Asian countries face the threat of the United States and Japan colluding to launch a war of aggression.
    As history enters the 1960s, two treaties of fundamentally opposite nature have emerged in Asia: one is the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty filled with the smell of gunpowder, and the other is the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression full of the spirit of peace and friendship. The former is to expand aggressive military blocs and prepare for new wars through military alliance treaties. The latter is to consolidate the Five Principles and seek lasting peace through friendly treaties. This is why the U.S.-Japan military alliance has been fiercely opposed by the people of all countries, especially the Japanese people, while the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression has been warmly welcomed by all peace-loving people around the world.
    The international reactionaries headed by U.S. imperialism have, in the past, spread a large number of rumors and slanders against the People's China, fabricating the so-called "danger from China" and "aggression," and saying that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are "outdated" and "dead." They attempted to use these lies about China's "aggression" to intimidate Asian countries, sow discord and undermine the relations between Asian countries and China, and shake the faith of Asian governments and peoples in the Five Principles, so as to facilitate their fishing in troubled waters and promote a policy of expansion and aggression towards Asia. However, the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Sino-Burmese Agreement on Boundary Issues have once again put the rumor-mongers in an embarrassing situation. May I ask the rumor-making experts in the United States, didn't you say that the Five Principles are dead, why are they alive again now? Didn't you say that only China does not want peace, why is China signing peace treaties with its neighbors, while you are organizing aggressive military alliances everywhere? The unfortunate thing about these rumor-mongers is that they reverse black and white, so they will be exposed in a short time.
    The brilliance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence illuminates the road ahead for the Asian people. The Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Sino-Burmese Agreement on Boundary Issues have created a new example of peaceful coexistence for Asian countries. What can happen between China and Burma, why can't it happen equally between China and Asian countries, and between Asian countries? The Chinese government and people have always adhered to the Five Principles, resolutely advocated friendly cooperation and peaceful coexistence among Asian countries, and actively strived for the realization of the Five Principles in Asian countries. We firmly believe that no matter how great the resistance that still exists, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence will show its great vitality, and the friendly unity of the Asian people based on the Five Principles cannot be undermined after all.

    亚洲国家团结友好的新范例
    中缅友好和互不侵犯条约、中缅关于边界问题的协定，今天同时公布了。这是中缅两国政府，在和平共处五项原则的指导下，通过友好协商而取得的重大成果。这个条约和协定不仅标志着中缅两国的睦邻关系进入了一个新的阶段，而且为亚洲各国的友好合作与和睦相处树立了一个新范例。
    中缅友好和互不侵犯条约，是一个和平的条约。在这个条约里，中缅两国把它们共同倡导的和平共处的五项原则用条约形式固定下来了。条约规定：缔约双方承认和尊重彼此的独立、主权和领土完整。这是国际关系的准则。没有这种承认和尊重，任何正常的国际关系是不可能的。条约又规定，缔约双方保证用和平协商的方法解决双方之间的一切争端，而不诉诸武力。这是和平共处的一项主要原则。中缅两国都是爱好和平的国家，两国的最高利益是通过和平协商的办法，而不是用诉诸武力的办法，友好地解决两国之间的一切争端。中缅两国没有根本的利益冲突，没有任何问题不可以协商解决。条约又规定：缔约双方保证互不侵犯，不参加针对另一方的军事同盟。这一规定有着重大的意义。因为目前美帝国主义力图扩大它的侵略性的军事集团，这对美国制造亚洲国家互相对立的阴谋是一个重大的打击。条约还规定，缔约双方将本着友好合作的精神，按照平等互利和互不干涉内政的原则，发展和加强两国间经济和文化联系。中缅两国过去共同遭受帝国主义的压迫和剥削，经济上和文化都非常落后。两国人民的共同愿望是尽早结束这种落后状态，在发展自己的经济和文化中相互帮助，求得共同的繁荣。由此可见，中缅友好和互不侵犯条约是和平共处五项原则进一步的发展，是符合两国人民以及亚洲和平的利益的。
    中缅两国关于边界问题的协定是在和平共处五项原则的指导下，为了促进中缅边界问题的全面解决，为了巩固和进一步发展中缅友好而缔结的。中缅两国之间长期存在着边界问题。两国国界的中段和南段的大部分曾由中英两国于1894年和1897年两次签订条约和1941年换文加以划定。但是，两国之间还存在着以下的边界问题：第一、两国国界的北段（自尖高山起到中缅边界西端终点）全部是未定界，需要正式加以划定。第二、在这段未定界上，属于中国的片马、古浪、岗房三处各寨地方，于1905年到1911年期间为英国军队逐步侵占，应该归还中国。第三、根据1897年中英划界条约，位于南碗河和瑞丽江汇合处的属于中国的猛卯三角地区被划为英属缅甸的“永租”地区，这种“永租”不符合目前中缅之间的友好平等关系，需要废除。第四、中英1941年换文划定的一段边界有不合理之处，而且这段边界还未标界和树立界桩。从1954年起中缅两国政府开始了关于边界问题的接触。由于双方具有通过和平谈判解决边界争端和建立和平友好边界的真诚愿望，经过两国领导人的多次会谈和通信，双方的观点逐渐接近。这一次，经过两国总理会谈，终于缔结了关于边界问题的协定，对两国边界上现存的各项具体问题达成了原则性的协议，并且决定成立一个联合委员会，根据这些原则性的协议解决现存的各项具体问题，进行勘界和树立界桩的工作和起草中缅边界条约。在协定的第二条，双方同意，对自尖高山起到中缅边界西端终点的全部未定界，除片马、古浪、岗房地区以外，应遵照传统的习惯线定界，同时缅甸方面同意将过去为英军所侵占的中国领土片马、古浪、岗房地区归还中国，这就为解决两国的北段边界提供了明确的原则。缅甸政府这种无意继承帝国主义侵略产物，认为“不应该保留不是它所有的东西”的公平和友好的态度，是值得我们欢迎的。关于猛卯三角地区，我国政府考虑到缅甸在这里所修建的公路是连接缅甸掸邦和克钦邦的交通命脉，这个地区对于缅甸来说比较重要，因此同意把这个地区移交给缅甸，成为缅甸领土的一部分。作为交换，缅甸政府同意把1941年线以西的班洪和班老部落管辖区划归中国，成为中国领土的一部分，从而纠正了这两个部落原来被1941年线分割为中缅两部分的不合理状态。这样，中缅边界现存的各项具体问题都获得了原则性的解决。此外，在1941年中英换文中，曾经规定了中国在缅甸境内炉房有经营矿产企业的权利。这个规定有损于缅甸的主权；而对于社会主义的中国来说，保持这种特权性质的权利也是不可思议的。因此，我国声明放弃这个权利。
    中缅关于边界问题的协定的签订，充分表明中缅两国政府和人民具有摆脱帝国主义强加于两国身上的网罗、在新的基础上友好相处的共同愿望。有关边界的具体勘察和划定，虽然还需要根据协定而成立的联合委员会做一些工作，但是，解决问题的指导原则既已确定，只要双方根据和平共处的五项原则，整个边界问题，不难通过友好协商，求得公平、合理而又互利的解决。中缅关于边界问题的协定的签订，为最后的全面的解决历史上遗留下来的边界问题铺平了道路。
    中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和两国关于边界问题的协定的签订，是我国坚持不懈地执行和平外交政策的重大成果。同时，这也是同缅甸政府采取了遵守五项原则和友好协商的态度分不开的。我们非常赞成奈温总理在告别宴会上所说的话，“这一方面是由于两国政府的政治远见，同时也是由于有以和平共处为基础的五项原则”。
    中缅友好和互不侵犯条约，是出现在亚洲国家之间的第一个这样的和平条约。中缅关于边界问题的协定是亚洲国家之间合理解决边界争端的一个范例。这个条约和协定具有重大的历史意义。亚洲国家都曾经遭受帝国主义和殖民主义的掠夺和压迫，亚洲人民具有反对殖民主义和帝国主义的共同目标。在残暴和狡诈的侵略者面前，我们需要的是团结，是互相的同情和支援，只有这样，才能彻底粉碎帝国主义挑拨离间和奴役亚洲国家的阴谋，争取和维护民族独立，并且把自己的力量用于和平建设，早日改变由于帝国主义和殖民主义的侵略而造成的经济落后和文化落后的状态。中缅两国缔结的条约和协定，正是反映了中缅两国人民的这种共同的根本的利益。这一事实本身有力地证明了亚洲各国不仅应该而且可以团结友好、和睦共处，从而给亚洲各国人民带来了很大的鼓舞。
    同中缅友好和互不侵犯条约形成尖锐的对照的，是不久以前在华盛顿签字的日美军事同盟条约。通过这个条约，美国把日本变成了侵略的前进基地，复活日本军国主义，使中国、苏联以及亚洲各国人民面临着美日帝国主义勾结起来发动侵略战争的威胁。
    当历史进入二十世纪六十年代的时候，在亚洲出现了两个性质根本相反的条约：一个是充满了火药气味的美日军事同盟条约，一个是洋溢着和平友好精神的中缅友好和互不侵犯条约。前者是要通过军事同盟条约来扩大侵略性的军事集团，准备新的战争。后者是为的通过友好条约巩固五项原则，谋求持久的和平。这就是为什么美日军事同盟遭到各国人民、特别是日本人民的激烈反对，而中缅友好和互不侵犯条约受到全世界一切爱好和平人民的热烈欢迎。
    以美帝国主义为首的国际反动派，在过去一个时期中，大量散布对人民中国的造谣污蔑，虚构所谓“来自中国的危险”和“侵略”，说什么和平共处五项原则“过时了”、“死亡了”。他们企图用这些关于中国的“侵略”的谎言来恫吓亚洲国家，挑拨和破坏亚洲国家同中国的关系，动摇亚洲各国政府和人民对于五项原则的信念，以便于他们混水摸鱼，推行向亚洲扩张和侵略的政策。但是，中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和中缅关于边界问题的协定，又一次使造谣诽谤者陷入了狼狈的境地。请问美国的造谣专家们，你们不是说五项原则已经死了吗，为什么现在它又活了呢？你们不是说只有中国不要和平吗，为什么中国同它的邻邦签订了和平条约，而你们却到处组织侵略性的军事同盟呢？这些造谣诽谤者们倒霉的地方在于他们颠倒黑白，因此不需要很长的时间就原形毕露了。
    和平共处五项原则的光辉，照耀着亚洲人民的前进的道路。中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和中缅关于边界问题的协定，又为亚洲国家创造了一个和睦相处的新榜样。在中国和缅甸之间能够出现的事情，为什么不能够同样出现在中国和亚洲国家之间，出现在亚洲各国之间呢？中国政府和人民一贯信守五项原则，坚决地主张亚洲国家友好合作与和睦共处，并且积极地为在亚洲各国实现五项原则而努力不懈。我们深信，不管目前还存在多大的阻力，和平共处五项原则将显示它的伟大的生命力，亚洲人民基于五项原则的友好团结到底是破坏不了的。
