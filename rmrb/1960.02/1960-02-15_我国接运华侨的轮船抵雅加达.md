    Our Ships Carrying Overseas Chinese Arrive in Jakarta
    Overseas Chinese Eagerly Awaiting Return Home Cheer “Long Live the Motherland”
    Preparations for Receiving and Resettling Returned Overseas Chinese are Actively Underway

    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 13th: The first group of four ships sent by China to Indonesia to transport overseas Chinese back to the country have arrived at Tanjung Priok Port in Jakarta on February 12th and 13th.

    Liu Yufeng, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, the Consul of the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta, and personnel from the Chinese Embassy went to Tanjung Priok Port on the morning of February 12th to welcome the first arrivals, the "Hai Huang" and "Mei Shang Mei" ships. Huang Zhen, the Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia, hosted a banquet on the evening of February 13th to entertain the captains and all crew members of these two ships.

    Staff members on the ships said that everything has been prepared for the returning overseas Chinese, including cotton clothing, quilts, and medicines. They will warmly welcome the compatriots who are about to return to their motherland.

    Upon hearing the news that ships sent by the motherland had arrived, overseas Chinese in Indonesia were very excited.

    Huang Zhen, the Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia, and his wife visited the hostel on February 12th to express their sincere condolences to the overseas Chinese from Garut. Ambassador Huang Zhen visited each of their dormitories and had cordial talks with them. Ambassador Huang Zhen told them that the motherland and the government are very concerned about their situation. Now, the motherland has arranged everything for them and welcomes them to return to the motherland to participate in socialist construction, study, or spend their later years happily. Ambassador Huang Zhen also asked about their current living conditions and advised them to pay attention to their health so that they could return to the motherland safely.

    These overseas Chinese were deeply moved by Ambassador Huang Zhen's concern. Several elderly people shed tears. These elderly people told the ambassador that they were grateful for the care of the motherland and the government. All they were thinking about was returning to the motherland as soon as possible. The children surrounded Ambassador Huang Zhen and applauded. They said they wanted to hurry back to the motherland to study.

    Li Jusheng, the Chinese Consul General in Jakarta, and his wife, as well as Wu Zhizhi, the Chinese representative of the China-Indonesia Joint Committee who came on the ships transporting overseas Chinese, visited 250 overseas Chinese from Cikampek and Majalengka in West Java. These overseas Chinese overcame many difficulties to arrive in Jakarta on February 12th.

    Overseas Chinese who came from West Java to Jakarta to gather and wait for the ships from the motherland received a warm and heartfelt welcome from Jakarta's overseas Chinese communities. They were properly accommodated in temporary dormitories. Many overseas Chinese and students in Jakarta volunteered to take care of their lives and established a temporary clinic to provide them with free medical care. Some overseas Chinese even sent fruits and biscuits to comfort them.

    Before these four ships set sail for Jakarta, more than 1,000 returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students in Guangzhou held a grand meeting at Huangpu Port in Guangdong on February 5th to warmly send off the staff members accompanying the ships. Returned overseas Chinese, young and old, came to the meeting place with gongs and drums. They excitedly said that this was the first time in our country's history that ships had been sent abroad to pick up overseas Chinese, which showed that the motherland was becoming increasingly strong and overseas Chinese were no longer orphans abroad. Zhong Qingfa, Director of the General Office of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, and Lin Qiangyun, Vice Governor of Guangdong Province, also attended the meeting and delivered speeches on behalf of the Reception and Resettlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China and the People's Committee of Guangdong Province, respectively. Zhong Qingfa said: "In the past six months, powerful groups in Indonesia have launched a comprehensive anti-China and anti-Chinese wave, causing tens of thousands of overseas Chinese to lose their families and livelihoods, become displaced, and live in dire straits. The Indonesian authorities should immediately stop the forced relocation and other persecution activities against overseas Chinese. We support the several demands made by our Ambassador to Indonesia, Huang Zhen, on behalf of our government to the Indonesian government. We believe that these demands are reasonable and conducive to a comprehensive solution to the overseas Chinese issue." Zhong Qingfa and Lin Qiangyun both expressed a warm welcome to the Indonesian overseas Chinese who were about to return to China in their speeches, and asked all the staff members accompanying the ships to overcome difficulties, earnestly do a good job in receiving the returned overseas Chinese, and complete the important task entrusted by the motherland.

    Xinhua News Agency, February 14th: Jakarta News: Overseas Chinese who have been discriminated against and persecuted in the anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia are eagerly looking forward to returning to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible and participating in the socialist construction of the motherland.

    In West Java, those overseas Chinese who have been forcibly relocated and are now living in centralized detention areas have been deprived of their livelihoods and are living in misery, longing for their return home. They have been demanding that the Indonesian government send them back to China. When they heard the news that the motherland had sent ships to pick them up, they were very happy. Some were moved to tears, and some shouted, "Long Live the Motherland."

    According to preliminary statistics, more than 6,000 overseas Chinese in West Java have requested to return to the motherland on the first batch of ships sent by the motherland. More than 180 overseas Chinese arrived in Jakarta from Garut, West Java, on February 10th to wait for the ships sent by the motherland. They were warmly received by local overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese organizations. Overseas Chinese from all over West Java will continue to gather in Jakarta to prepare for their return home.

    In East Java, according to preliminary statistics, in six of the twenty-eight counties, 10,000 overseas Chinese have already registered to return to the motherland. Among them, more than 7,500 overseas Chinese have requested the Indonesian government to send them back to China because they have lost their jobs and are living in very difficult conditions under the influence of the Indonesian authorities' regulations prohibiting foreign small traders and retailers from operating in rural areas. In Bangka Island and Belitung, where there are many overseas Chinese, the majority of them are preparing to return to the motherland.

    In Medan, North Sumatra, more than 900 overseas Chinese booked tickets to return to the motherland in February.

    In South Sumatra, according to preliminary statistics, there are 1,000 overseas Chinese in Lampung who hope to return to the motherland.

    Most of the overseas Chinese preparing to return to the motherland will go back with their families. In Lombok, Bali and Payakumbuh, West Sumatra, many overseas Chinese living in rural areas or towns are preparing to return to the motherland with their entire families.

    The Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta and the consulates in Medan, Makassar, and Banjarmasin are busy day and night receiving overseas Chinese who wish to return to the motherland and are quickly preparing passports for them. The offices of overseas Chinese organizations throughout Indonesia are crowded every day with overseas Chinese who are registering to return to the motherland.

    Many overseas Chinese preparing to return home said, "The great motherland cares about us, and we are no longer orphans abroad"; "We are determined to return to the motherland, and no obstacles or sabotage can shake us."

    Among the overseas Chinese preparing to return home are white-haired elderly people who were sold as indentured laborers in their youth, and young students who have settled in Indonesia for several generations and have never been to the motherland. Lin Yangkuan (transliteration), who came from Garut to Jakarta to wait for ships to return to the motherland, is already 61 years old. He is the fifth generation born in Indonesia. He said, "My ancestors came from Fujian. I have always missed my motherland. In the past, I did not have money to return. Now, the motherland has specially sent ships to pick us up. This is indeed something I never dreamed of in the past."

    A large number of overseas Chinese are determined to actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland after returning to the country. A wave of learning technical knowledge has been launched. Many overseas Chinese organizations and schools in various cities have opened training classes to learn techniques such as repairing radios and cars, typing, photography, and sewing according to the needs of overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese are actively participating in these training classes. Overseas Chinese in some cities have also gone to local factories individually or collectively to work as temporary apprentices to learn technical knowledge.

    Xinhua News Agency, February 14th: After the State Council issued instructions on receiving and resettling returned overseas Chinese, the Reception and Resettlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China and the relevant departments of Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Yunnan, and other provinces and autonomous regions have carried out a series of preparatory work in accordance with the instructions of the State Council.

    The Reception and Resettlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China established an office in Guangzhou, with Zhong Qingfa, Director of the General Office of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, concurrently serving as the director of the office. For more than 20 days, staff members have been reporting to this office every day. They come from Beijing, Fujian, Guangxi, Yunnan, and various parts of Guangdong Province. At present, nearly 100 administrative staff, medical personnel, service personnel, translators, and others have been assembled, and a large number of staff members will arrive in Guangzhou soon. At the same time, the Reception and Resettlement Committees for Returned Overseas Chinese of Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and Yunnan provinces and autonomous regions have also been established successively, with a secretary of the provincial party committee or the autonomous region party committee serving as the director of the committee. An office has been set up under the committee to specifically be responsible for the preparatory work for receiving and resettling returned overseas Chinese.

    The people of all regions regard receiving and resettling returned overseas Chinese as a glorious task. The relevant departments in various regions have given priority to allocating and supplying the materials needed for receiving and resettling returned overseas Chinese. The Grain Bureau of Guangdong Province, the Commercial Bureau of Guangzhou City, and the Pharmaceutical Company of Guangzhou City alone provided more than 50 tons of materials for the first batch of ships transporting returned overseas Chinese. In Guangzhou, Zhanjiang, Shantou, Haikou, and other ports, guest houses for returned overseas Chinese have been newly built or expanded. State-owned overseas Chinese farms and state-owned farms in Guangdong Province, which will resettle a large number of returned overseas Chinese, are expanding and building houses. A batch of houses and apartments will also be added to the Guangzhou Overseas Chinese New Village. An agricultural secondary technical school, a secondary technical school for returned overseas Chinese students, and an overseas Chinese primary school, which Guangdong Province has added for returned overseas Chinese students, are also being actively prepared for construction. Fujian Province has allocated a batch of funds and construction materials such as steel, cement, and wood to expand and build new state-owned overseas Chinese farms and other resettlement places to ensure that the overseas Chinese who are about to return to the country can settle down. All regions have decided to guarantee that returned overseas Chinese will be received and resettled one by one, and families will be received and resettled one by one. Those who are willing to work will be properly arranged according to the needs of the country and their personal wishes. Those who are willing to return to their original place of origin to reunite with their relatives will be helped to return to their original place of origin and properly resettled by the local people's committee and people's commune. Returned overseas Chinese students and vocational youths with learning conditions will be helped and arranged to study according to their age and education level.

    这些华侨对黄镇大使的关怀深为感动，有几个老人流下眼泪。这些老人对大使说，他们感谢祖国和政府的关怀。他们心里想的只是尽快回到祖国。孩子们围着黄镇大使鼓掌。他们说，他们要赶回祖国学习。
    中国驻雅加达总领事李菊生和夫人以及乘接运华侨回国的轮船来的中国和印度尼西亚联合委员会的中国代表伍治之，慰问了来自西爪哇双木丹和马渣连加的二百五十名侨胞。这些华侨是克服了重重困难在12日抵达雅加达的。
    从西爪哇到雅加达来集合和等待祖国来的船只的华侨来到这里后，受到雅加达华侨团体热情和衷心的欢迎。他们被妥善地安置在临时宿舍里。雅加达的许多华侨和学生自愿出来照料他们的生活，并且成立了临时诊疗所，免费替他们看病。有些华侨甚至送水果和饼干来慰问他们。
    在这四艘轮船启程来雅加达之前，广州市归国华侨、侨眷和归侨学生一千多人曾于5日在广东黄埔港举行大会，热烈欢送随船的工作人员。归国华侨们扶老携幼、敲锣打鼓地赶到大会会场，他们激动地说，这是我国有史以来第一次派船出国接运华侨回国，这表明祖国日益强大，华侨再不是海外孤儿了。中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会办公厅主任钟庆发和广东省副省长林锵云也参加了大会，并分别代表中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会和广东省人民委员会，先后在会上讲了话。钟庆发说：“近半年来，印度尼西亚有势力的集团掀起了全面的反华排华浪潮，使成千上万的华侨倾家荡产，流离失所，生活陷于绝境。印度尼西亚当局应当立即制止对华侨的迫迁和其它迫害活动。我们拥护我国驻印度尼西亚黄镇大使代表我国政府向印度尼西亚政府提出的几项要求，我们认为这些要求是合情合理的，有利于全面地解决华侨问题”。钟庆发和林锵云在讲话中都对即将回国的印度尼西亚侨胞表示热烈欢迎，并要求全体随船工作人员排除困难，认真做好接待归侨工作，完成祖国托付的重任。
    新华社14日讯　雅加达消息：在印度尼西亚发生的排华活动中受到歧视和迫害的华侨，迫切地盼望着能早日回到祖国的怀抱，参加祖国的社会主义建设。
    在西爪哇，那些遭到强迫迁移现在居住在集中拘留的地方里的华侨，被剥夺了生计，度日如年，归心似箭。他们一直在要求印度尼西亚政府把他们送回中国。当他们听到祖国已经派船来接他们回去的消息时，他们十分高兴。有些人感动得流下眼泪，有些人高呼“祖国万岁”。

    在东爪哇，据初步统计，全部二十八个县的六个县内，就有一万名华侨已经登记要求返回祖国。其中有七千五百多名华侨要求印度尼西亚政府把他们送回中国去，因为在印度尼西亚当局取缔外侨小商贩和零售商在乡村地区营业的条例的影响下，他们都失业了，生活非常困难。在华侨众多的邦加岛和勿里洞，大多数华侨都在准备返回祖国。
    在北苏门答腊的棉兰，在2月份就有九百多名华侨订了回祖国去的船票。

    许多准备回国的华侨说，“伟大的祖国在关心我们，我们再也不是海外孤儿了”；“我们决心回祖国去，任何障碍和破坏行为都不能使我们发生动摇”。
    在准备回国的华侨当中，有在青年时代就卖身作契约工的白发苍苍的老人，有好几代都定居在印度尼西亚而从未到过祖国的青年学生。从牙律到雅加达来等候船只回祖国的林杨宽（音）已有六十一岁了。他是出生在印度尼西亚的第五代的人。他说，“我的祖先是从福建来的，我一直怀念着我的祖国，在过去，我没有钱回去。现在，祖国已经专门派船来接我们回去了。这确实是我过去永远梦想不到的事情”。
    大批华侨决心在回到祖国以后积极参加祖国的社会主义建设。一个学习技术知识的热潮已经掀起。许多城市的华侨团体和学校已经根据华侨的要求开办了学习修理无线电和汽车、打字、照像和缝纫等技术的训练班。华侨都积极地参加这些训练班学习。一些城市的华侨还个别或集体地到当地工厂去当临时学徒，来学习技术知识。
