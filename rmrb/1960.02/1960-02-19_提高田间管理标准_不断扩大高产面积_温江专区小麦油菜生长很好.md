Raise Field Management Standards, Continuously Expand High-Yield Areas
Wenjiang Prefecture's Wheat and Rapeseed Growing Well

    This newspaper reports that the Wenjiang Prefecture of Sichuan Province, in its field management of summer harvest crops, has universally adopted the management measures and methods of command fields and high-yield fields, thereby continuously expanding the area of high-yield and bumper-harvest fields.

    Up to now, the area of high-yield wheat fields in the entire prefecture has expanded from 30% of the total wheat area at the initial planting to 50%; the area of high-yield rapeseed fields has expanded from the original 30% to over 90%. Many of the original cadre high-yield command fields and high-yield and bumper-harvest fields have gradually expanded into command zones, high-yield dams, and bumper-harvest roads (all high-yield fields along major roads). From the vast Sichuan West Plain to the mountainous and hilly areas surrounding the Qionglai Mountains, everywhere one sees fields of crops better than the next; wheat is universally tillering and jointing, and rapeseed is mostly budding and bolting; the growth of seedlings is even higher than in the great harvest of last year.

    Universally adopting the management measures and methods of high-yield fields, raising the quality standards of field management, and continuously expanding high-yield fields are among the production increase measures proposed by the CPC Wenjiang Prefectural Committee to further implement the policy of multiple planting for high yields. Based on an analysis of the current excellent production situation in the entire prefecture, the Wenjiang Prefectural Committee believes that further expanding high-yield fields in the field management process is entirely possible and necessary. First, the foundation for wheat and rapeseed production this year is good. All wheat and rapeseed land was deeply plowed to a depth of about one foot, and more than 20,000 jin of base fertilizer was applied per mu, half more than last year. The policy of rational close planting was implemented, with wheat sown at about 30 jin per mu and rapeseed with 6,000 to 9,000 seedlings per mu, all to a higher standard and quality than last year. As management becomes more meticulous, the growth of seedlings improves. Second, through socialist education, the ideological awareness of the broad masses of peasants has been further enhanced, their enthusiasm is immense, and their fighting spirit is high. In small spring management, they are grasping every step tightly, managing more meticulously, and forming a situation of mutual competition and universal striving for progress. Third, it is still early before the flowering and fruiting period of these crops. As long as we earnestly implement the principle of "30% planting, 70% management," it will play a decisive role in increasing production. Fourth, the entire prefecture has expanded the planting area of summer-ripening crops such as wheat and rapeseed by more than 30% this year. This is one aspect of multiple planting for multiple yields and increasing the proportion of the summer harvest. Expanding the area of high-yield fields while managing ordinary fields well is the key to increasing yield per unit area and realizing high yields, multiple yields, and increasing the proportion of the summer harvest in another aspect.

    Based on these circumstances, the CPC Wenjiang Prefectural Committee issued a call to all counties and communes in the prefecture, requiring them to universally promote the management measures of high-yield fields and to further expand the area of high-yield fields in field management.

    The Prefectural Committee also summarized the management measures and experiences of high-yield fields in various localities and put forward ten specific requirements for high standards of field management: 1. Complete and strong seedlings; 2. Abundant and well-applied fertilizer; 3. Garden-style cultivation; 4. Technology meeting specifications; 5. Specific production increase measures; 6. Establishment of specialized management teams; 7. Comprehensive management, paying attention not only to food crops but also to crops such as rapeseed and green manure; 8. Timely management; 9. Regular inspections; 10. Military-style action. The battle slogan is: "Hearts united from top to bottom, masses working with one mind, crops all looking the same."

    The entire prefecture successively convened on-site mobile meetings on small spring management in advanced areas such as Pixian, Xindu, Xinfan, and Guanghan counties, and organized more than 400 county and commune party secretaries to visit Lezhi County, the banner of wheat production in the province. Each county and commune also selected model communes, management areas, and production teams in their local areas for field management as learning examples. Thus, setting up models at every level made the high standards of field management more specific. Each county also comprehensively carried out high-standard field management competitions, four-sided competitions, and rivalries, conducting large-scale assessments and inspections, making the production upsurge higher than the last. After half a month of concentrated effort, the entire prefecture basically achieved the above ten requirements in the field management of small spring crops.

    After field assessments, new high-yield fields were selected, plans were immediately revised, measures were added, and management work was done well. After Wenjiang County doubled its high-yield wheat and rapeseed fields, it immediately divided the areas into sections and strengthened Party leadership. The continuous high-yield fields on both sides of the county's two highways were designated as two high-yield command roads, directly controlled by the county party committee and personally led by two deputy secretaries of the county party committee; the remaining high-yield fields in the county were divided into five high-yield zones, each led by a member of the county party committee. The high-yield zones of each commune were also led by the party secretary. In order to strengthen contact and unify specifications, the five high-yield zones established a joint headquarters to unify command. Each commune in Xinfan County convened oaths rallies to seize high yields, re-revised the increased production plans for the newly expanded high-yield fields, and added measures. Qingbai, Wan'an, Xinmin, and other communes stipulated that rapeseed in high-yield fields should be top-dressed with fertilizer every seven days, with the originally planned eight to ten top-dressings now changed to ten to fifteen, attacking the budding and bolting fertilizer; wheat should be top-dressed with fertilizer every fifteen days, loosened once, and irrigated in a timely manner based on the weather, field conditions, and seedling growth. Various localities also launched large-scale fertilizer accumulation and production campaigns to meet the needs of expanding high-yield fields.

    Due to the development of high-standard management competitions and the expansion of high-yield fields, the field management of general summer harvest crops has been greatly promoted. Each county made block-by-block identifications and assessments of ordinary fields, formulated specific plans to catch up with high-yield fields, and launched activities to "catch up with, overtake, and surpass" high-yield fields.

    提高田间管理标准  不断扩大高产面积
    温江专区小麦油菜生长很好
    本报讯　四川省温江专区在夏收作物田间管理中，普遍采用指挥田和高产田的管理措施和方法，使高额丰产田的面积不断扩大。
    到目前为止，全区小麦高产田的面积，由最初播种时占小麦总面积30％扩大到50％；油菜高产田的面积，由原来的30％扩大到90％以上。许多原来的干部高产指挥田和高额丰产田，已逐渐扩大成为指挥片、高产坝和丰产路（沿大路两旁全系高产田）。从广阔的川西平原，到周围邛崃山脉的山地、丘陵区，到处是一块赛过一块的好庄稼；小麦普遍分蘖、拔节，油菜大部开盘、抽苔；苗架生长情况比大丰收的去年又高出一层。
    普遍采用高产田的管理措施和方法，提高田间管理质量标准，不断扩大高产田，这是中共温江地委进一步贯彻多种高产多收的方针而提出的增产措施之一。根据当前全区生产形势无限好的情况分析，温江地委认为，在田间管理过程中进一步扩大高产田，是完全可能的和必要的。首先，今年小麦、油菜生产的基础好，全部小麦、油菜地深翻一尺左右，每亩施底肥二万多斤，比去年多施一半，贯彻执行了合理密植，小麦每亩用种三十斤左右，油菜每亩有苗六千到九千株，规格、质量都高过去年。随着管理越抓越细，苗架生长越来越好。第二、经过社会主义教育，广大农民群众思想觉悟进一步提高，干劲十足，斗志昂扬；在小春管理上，步步抓紧，管得更细，形成你追我赶，人人争先的局面。第三，现在离这些作物的开花、结实期间还早，只要认真做到“三分种，七分管”，将对增产起决定作用。第四，全区今年扩大小麦、油菜等夏熟作物种植面积30％以上，这是多种多收、增加夏收产量比重的一方面；扩大高产田面积，同时管理好一般田，这是提高单位面积产量的关键，是实现高产多收、增加夏收比重的另一方面。
    根据这些情况，中共温江地委向全区各县、公社发出号召，要求各地普遍推广高产田的管理措施，在田间管理中进一步扩大高产田面积。
    地委又总结出各地高产田的管理措施和经验，提出田间管理高标准的十项具体要求：一、全苗壮苗；二、肥料施得多、施得好；三、耕作园田化；四、技术符合规格；五、增产措施具体；六、建立专业队管理；七、管理要全面，不仅注意粮食作物，而且要注意油菜、绿肥等作物；八、管理要及时；九、要经常检查；十、行动战斗化。战斗口号是：“上下一条心，群众一股劲，庄稼一个样”。
    全区先后在先进地区郫县、新都、新繁、广汉等县，召开了小春管理流动现场会议，并组织县、公社党委书记等四百多人前往全省小麦生产旗帜乐至县参观。各县、公社又在当地选拔田间管理的标兵公社、管理区和生产队，作为学习榜样。这样层层树立标兵，使田间管理的高标准更加具体。各县还全面开展了田间管理高标准竞赛、四边竞赛、对手赛等，进行大评比、大检查，使生产高潮一浪高过一浪。经过半个月的突击运动，全区在小春作物田间管理，基本上实现了上述十项要求。
    各地经过田间排队，选拔出新的高产田以后，立即修订计划，增添措施，做好管理工作。温江县在小麦、油菜高产田扩大一倍以后，立即分段划区，加强党的领导。全县两条公路两旁的成片高产田划作两条高产指挥路，由县委直接掌握，归两个县委副书记亲自领导；全县其余高产田划分五个高产大片，分别由五个县委委员负责领导。各公社高产片也由党委书记挂帅。为了加强联系、统一规格，五个高产大片又成立联合指挥部，统一指挥。新繁县各公社都分别召开了夺高产誓师大会，重新修订新扩大高产田的增产计划，增添措施。青白、万安、新民等公社，都规定高产田油菜七天追肥一次，原订追肥八至十次，现改为十至十五次，猛攻开盘、抽苔肥；小麦每隔十五天追肥一次，再松土一次，并作到看天看田看苗进行适时灌水。各地还开展了大规模积肥造肥运动，适应扩大高产田的需要。
    由于开展了高标准管理竞赛，扩大了高产田，因而大大促进了一般夏收作物的田间管理。各县对一般田都作了逐块鉴定排队，作出追赶高产田的具体规划，开展了“追、赶、超”高产田的活动。
