Hubei’s ramie producing areas' people's communes are vigorously undertaking intensive winter and spring cultivation management of ramie fields and actively preparing to expand new ramie fields, striving for an even greater leap forward in ramie production this year.

Recently, counties, communes, and production teams in various ramie producing areas are discussing and formulating this year's ramie production plans. Building on the foundation of the 1959 ramie bumper harvest despite the drought, they have proposed leap forward targets of increasing production by 30% to 50% or more this year. The ramie areas here are simultaneously planning and taking action, vigorously engaging in winter and spring cultivation management of ramie fields. Yangxin County has already completed soil application and hilling to protect the base of the plants and pest and weed control in approximately 80% of its existing ramie fields. While strengthening the cultivation management of old ramie fields, various areas are also actively expanding new ramie fields by collecting ramie seeds and dividing and transplanting old ramie bases.

All ramie areas attach great importance to the basic construction of water, fertilizer, and soil in ramie fields and are making concrete preparations to achieve self-flowing irrigation, the "five haves" of fertilizer accumulation and production (i.e., pens for pigs and cattle, toilets for people, manure pits at the field head, green manure base, and fertilizer plants in the production team), and making the ramie fields contiguous and garden-like. Various production units are also combining the formulation of ramie production plans with mobilizing the masses to summarize advanced production experiences, study yield-increasing technical measures, and vigorously innovate technology.

(Dispatch from this newspaper) The people's communes of Dushan County, Guizhou Province, have broken with the conventional practice of planting ramie only in the spring and have launched a crash campaign of winter ramie planting. From December 20 to 31 of last year, the county newly planted more than 46,300 mu of ramie, more than three times the area of the original ramie gardens, completing the task of expanding ramie gardens for 1960 ahead of schedule and exceeding the target.

Dushan County is the main ramie producing area in Guizhou Province. Last year, the county's 15,000 mu of ramie achieved a bumper harvest of 105 jin per mu. In order to accelerate the development of this production, the Dushan County Party Committee decided to expand the ramie garden area to 60,000 mu. In mid-December of last year, it convened an on-site meeting in Wangcheng, Pingtang, and Libo communes to summarize and promote the benefits of winter ramie transplanting. Based on summarizing the benefits of winter ramie planting, the communes successively put forward the slogan "Break with convention and plant ramie in winter." The twelve communes of the county quickly established crash transplanting ramie headquarters, dispatched more than 60,000 people, and launched a crash campaign to plant ramie in winter.

    湖北苎麻产区培育老麻田扩大新麻田
    贵州独山县打破常规冬栽苎麻
    本报汉口13日电　湖北省各苎麻产地的人民公社，正在大力突击麻田的冬春季培育管理，并为扩大新麻田积极做好准备，争取今年苎麻生产的更大跃进。
    近来，各苎麻产区的县、公社和生产队，正在讨论制订今年的苎麻生产规划，在1959年苎麻大旱大丰收的基础上，分别提出今年增产三成到五成以上的跃进指标。这里的各麻区正在边规划、边行动，大搞麻田冬春季培育管理。阳新县现有麻田进行壅土培蔸，除虫除草的已达80％左右。在加强老麻田的培育管理的同时，各地还在积极通过采集苎麻种籽和分蔸移植老麻蔸等办法扩大新麻田。
    各麻区都很重视麻田的水、肥、土等基本建设，正为实现麻田水利自流灌溉化，积肥造肥的“五有化”（即猪牛有栏、人有厕所、田头有粪窖、绿肥有基地、生产队有制肥厂），和麻田连片园田化进行具体准备。各生产单位还结合制订苎麻生产规划，发动群众总结先进生产经验，研究增产技术措施，大力革新技术。
    本报讯　贵州省独山县各人民公社，打破只有春天才能栽麻的常规，开展了冬季栽麻的突击运动。从去年12月20日至31日，全县新栽苎麻四万六千三百多亩，为原有麻园面积的三倍多，提前超额完成1960年扩大麻园的任务。
    独山县是贵州省苎麻主要产区，去年全县一万五千亩苎麻，获得亩产一百零五斤的大丰收。为了加速发展这项生产，独山县委决定将麻园面积扩大到六万亩，并于去年12月中旬，在望城、平塘、荔波三个公社召开了冬季移栽苎麻现场会议，总结和推广冬季栽麻的好处。在总结苎麻冬栽的好处的基础上，各公社纷纷提出“打破常规，冬季栽麻”的口号。全县十二个公社迅速成立了突击移栽苎麻指挥部，出动了六万多人，掀起了冬栽苎麻的突击运动。（黔南经济作物管理局）
