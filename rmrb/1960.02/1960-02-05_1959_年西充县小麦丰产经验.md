Xi充 County in Sichuan is known as a poor county with many mountains and thin soil. Of the county's 630,000 mu of cultivated land, paddy fields account for only one-third, and about 70% of the dry land is thin soil less than one chi deep. To adapt to these soil conditions, farmers in the past always planted sweet potatoes in the spring and peas in the winter. Only a few plots of land were planted with wheat, and the yield was very low, averaging less than 100 jin per mu before liberation. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, farming techniques have been continuously improved, and wheat production has increased year after year. In 1958, the average wheat yield reached 168.8 jin per mu, an increase of nearly one-fold compared with before liberation. In 1959, the average wheat yield jumped to 452.9 jin per mu, an increase of 1.6-fold compared with 1958. This is a victory for the people's commune, a victory for the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, and a victory for the struggle between man and nature, as well as the struggle between advanced and conservative ideas. These victories have further strengthened our firm belief that "man will conquer nature, and everything depends on human effort." At the same time, we have also initially explored certain experiences in leadership methods and farming techniques, opening up a broad road for winning greater harvests this year.

“One-Dragon” High-Yield Organization

Secretary taking the lead, relying on the advanced, driving the intermediate, and improving the backward is the basic experience of Xi充 County in leading the large-scale high yield of wheat in 1959. From planting to harvesting, we have always adopted the working method of "taking the high-yield area as the position, taking the command field as the core, driving large areas, and making a breakthrough in the third category of seedlings." A total of five high-yield routes and forty-one high-yield areas were established in the county, covering about 100,000 mu of wheat fields. These high-yield areas are generally managed by the commune party committee, with secretaries at all levels personally directing the battle and establishing their own command fields within the area to explore the law of high wheat yields in order to guide the entire production. The eleven members of the county party committee in charge of agricultural production were divided into areas to take full responsibility. At the same time, the method of "cadre responsibility area" was promoted among all county, district, commune, and team cadres, and experimental fields were established in the area as the basis for guiding production in the entire area. Below the area, production teams or work groups were used as units to form more than 4,000 wheat field management professional groups to implement "area-based contracting, group management" to strengthen the responsibility system for field management. In this way, there are areas below the route, large areas covering small areas, and command fields and experimental fields at all levels, conscientiously achieving the "four implementations" of "tasks, measures, materials, and labor," forming a "one-dragon" high-yield organization from the county to the district to the commune to the team, and fully utilizing the mass line method of relying on the advanced, driving the intermediate, and improving the backward to promote production. In every link of wheat production, areas and groups carried out chain competitions with each other. Through chain competitions and on-site meetings, inspections and evaluations were carried out, and communes and teams were organized to conduct self-inspections and mutual inspections to promote each other. Despite this, third-category areas and third-category seedlings still often existed. We also launched a special campaign to make breakthroughs in the third category of seedlings, implementing fixed leadership and labor, and requiring regular changes. As a result, the area of the third category of seedlings was reduced from more than 20% to less than 5%.

Facts have proved that if wheat seedlings are to grow well, it is necessary to grasp them firmly and continuously discover and cultivate new advanced areas, establish models, and let backward areas quickly catch up. Wherever this mass line working method is adhered to, production will be good.

Implement the "Eight-Point Charter" in Light of Local Conditions

Implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture in light of local conditions is the fundamental guarantee for high wheat yields. In this regard, we have initially figured out some rules. Now summarized as follows:

Deep Plowing

Xi充 County generally adopted three methods of deep plowing: ① For fields with deeper soil, heavy soil, and hardened soil, first remove the topsoil (cultivation layer), then deeply dig the subsoil, mix and apply base fertilizer, and finally restore the topsoil. This method can greatly increase the depth of plowing, but it is slow and requires more labor; ② For fields with deeper soil and loose soil layers, the topsoil can be moved away first, and then plowing can be carried out, plowing the first plow, pulling the soil open with a tipping board or hoe, and then plowing the second time, and adopting the method of taking the front and repeating the back to cover the topsoil on the subsoil in sequence to avoid disturbing the soil layer. The advantage of this method is that it is fast and requires less labor, but the depth can only reach about one chi; ③ For thin soil layers, take the method of transferring soil and using foreign soil to thicken the soil layer, so that the soil layer less than one chi can be thickened to more than two chi. Regardless of which of the above three methods is used, it must be done without disturbing the soil layer and with mixed application of base fertilizer, so as to turn the subsoil into fertile soil.

Deep plowing must be combined with fertilization. There are generally two methods of fertilization: one is layered mixed fertilization, that is, while deeply digging the subsoil, place the fertilizer on the subsoil and mix it while digging. This method can enable wheat seedlings to evenly absorb nutrients and promote seedling growth. The other is to take layered fertilization. After later observation, due to the separation of manure and soil, it is not conducive to the growth of wheat seedlings: the root system of the fertile soil mixed layer is both numerous and strong, the pure soil layer has many roots but not strong, the root system of the pure fertilizer layer does not grow well, and there is a degradation state, especially if the fertilizer is not fully rotted, it is even more serious. Therefore, we believe that mixed fertilization is better.

To what extent should deep plowing be appropriate? From the growth of wheat, generally speaking, as the depth of deep plowing increases, the root system correspondingly develops, and deepens with the deepening of the cultivated layer. Because the roots are deep, and the root system is widely distributed, absorbing more nutrients, under the same other conditions, the increase in production has a significant difference. However, deep plowing should also be limited. According to our observation after washing the wheat roots in a wheat field in Yixing Commune that was deeply plowed to nine chi, the root system was quite developed within five cun of the wheat foot; at five cun to one chi, large roots existed and fine roots decreased by 50%; at one chi to two chi, large roots decreased to 30%-40%, and fine roots decreased to 20%-30%; at two chi to three chi, large roots were sparse, and fine roots were thin and weak and could not be seen clearly; above three chi, there were very few wheat roots. This proves that plowing too deeply is not only not beneficial, but also affects production increase.

Close Planting

Close planting is the center of high-yield wheat technology. On this basis, strive for large ears and heavy grains, and high yield is guaranteed. However, close planting must be reasonable. In 1958, the amount of wheat seeds used in our county was generally 25 to 35 jin, and a few high-yield fields used 40 to 80 jin. From the actual growth situation, under normal conditions, the former can basically achieve neat upper forest and close planting without lodging. However, the latter were already crowded with each other as soon as they tillered, making ventilation and light transmission difficult, and field operations were also inconvenient; in the later stage of growth, not only were the ears short and the grains light, but there were also more degraded grains. Therefore, if more than 40 jin of seeds are used per mu, if special efforts are not made to cultivate them, the probability of high yield is not high.

In terms of sowing methods, all of them have promoted strip sowing. The row spacing is 2×5, (cun, same below) 2.5×2.5, 3×3, 3×4, 3×5, 3×6, 3×7, 3×8 and other specifications. According to the standards of high land utilization rate, high upper forest rate, and good harvest, the results of the investigation of various sowing specifications are: 2×5 and 2.5×2.5 have poor ventilation and light transmission, and small land utilization rate; 3×3 and 3×4 also have the disadvantage of small land utilization rate; 3×5, 3×6, and 3×7 are more suitable; 3×8 is too wide, and there are more dead seedlings, weak seedlings, and yellow seedlings in the middle. Therefore, too wide or too narrow sowing widths are not good.

Regarding ridge sowing, box sowing, and the problem of large and small boxes. The advantage of ridge sowing is mainly high land utilization rate, but the disadvantage is that it is not easy to conserve water and fertilizer. After fertilization and irrigation, water and fertilizer often flow to the ditches between the ridges. If it rains, it is even more serious; moreover, even if the east-west direction is mastered in opening the ridges, there is also the phenomenon of half the seedlings being good and half the seedlings being poor. Box sowing overcomes the shortcomings of ridge sowing completely, except that the land utilization rate is not as good as ridge sowing. However, box sowing is also better for small boxes than large boxes. Small boxes have good ventilation and light transmission, which is convenient for field operations. Fertilization, irrigation, and insect removal can all be done at home, without trampling on the seedlings. At the same time, it can also accurately calculate the amount of seeds used, so as to achieve close and uniform sowing.

Fertilizer

After wheat is closely planted, without enough fertilizer, high yield is not guaranteed. At the same time, the amount, timing, and quality of fertilizer application will directly affect the level of yield. From the perspective of fertilizer sources in our county, generally speaking, it is pig and cattle manure, grass residue, sludge, old house mud, and other miscellaneous fertilizers. Except for high-yield areas, chemical fertilizers are rarely used; from the perspective of fertilizer use, it is generally felt that it is insufficient. In 1959, the actual fertilizer use per mu in large areas (medium fertilizer) was only 10,000 to 20,000 jin, while high-yield areas used 30,000 to 50,000 jin. According to the investigation of the county party committee command area, with the increase in the degree of deep plowing, every five cun deep with 10,000 jin of better quality fertilizer can guarantee high wheat yield. Under the conditions of deep plowing one and a half chi and using 30,000 jin of fertilizer, there is a guarantee of producing 1,000 jin per mu in well-managed wheat fields.

With fertilizer, attention must also be paid to combined application. There are two methods of combination, one is the combination of natural fertilizer and chemical fertilizer; the other is the appropriate and timely combination of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. From the observation of the actual growth situation, natural fertilizer should be used more, and chemical fertilizer should be used less. Many wheat fields that rely solely on chemical fertilizer have not produced good results. Natural fertilizer contains more organic matter, and the fertilizer effect is stable and uniform after application, and the seedlings are not prone to grow rapidly. Therefore, in order to ensure high yield, natural fertilizer should be the main fertilizer, and chemical fertilizer should be supplementary. In the combination of the three elements of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, it is necessary to grasp the law of "phosphorus applied at both ends, focusing on the front; potassium applied in the middle, focusing on jointing; nitrogen fertilizer supplemented, the amount should not be too much." But it should be noted that the base fertilizer should be a fertilizer with all three elements of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and the top dressing should be mainly nitrogen and phosphorus in the early stage, and mainly phosphorus and potassium in the later stage. Among the three elements, phosphorus and potassium have a more significant effect on increasing wheat production. More use of phosphorus and potassium fertilizer is beneficial to strong stalks and full grains. In terms of the number and proportion of fertilization, the principle of "heavy base fertilizer, periodic top dressing" should be grasped. Because the fertilizer is sufficient, the wheat seedlings have been strong from the time they emerge from the soil, and there are very few yellow and thin seedlings. Some wheat fields with insufficient base fertilizer, although top dressing is very frequent, the seedlings turn yellow again three or five days after top dressing. Therefore, whether the base fertilizer can be applied fully is a key issue. The county has universally mastered the top dressing in five seasons, such as needle, tillering, jointing, booting, and grain filling, and among them, the jointing fertilizer is mainly grasped, because this is the key period to determine large ears and many grains. In addition, we also carried out foliar spraying of phosphorus and potassium and cultivated shale powder to increase phosphorus and potassium fertilizer.

Lodging Prevention

Lodging prevention is the center of wheat field management. Based on the spirit of prevention being more important than cure, we have incorporated lodging prevention into the entire wheat production process. In addition to basic measures such as deep plowing, uniform sowing, rational close planting, and skillful fertilization, the following more effective methods have also been adopted:

First, soil cultivation and stool piling. At the end of tillering and the beginning of jointing, use shale powder mixed with fine sand to carry out a soil cultivation and stool piling, with a thickness of more than one cun, and individual fields have a thickness of three cun, the effect of which is reflected in: (1) The basal stalks are thick and hard, which has the effect of strengthening the stalks; (2) It can control ineffective tillering and promote plant-by-plant upper forest; (3) When cultivating the soil, the seedlings are separated, which can help ventilation and light transmission in a short period of time; (4) The effect of water and fertilizer conservation is increased after the soil cultivation; (5) The ground height of the plants is reduced, and the lodging resistance is enhanced. Soil cultivation should be carried out in stages, and each time it is appropriate to cultivate about five fen. If it is too thick, the basal internodes are prone to turn white and yellow, affecting the growth of wheat seedlings. The soil cultivation time is suitable from tillering to before heading. If it is too late, the operation is difficult and it is easy to break the stalks. Combining the application of some phosphorus and potassium fertilizer when cultivating the soil will have a greater effect. According to the investigation of 12 mu of high-yield fields in Yixing Commune, under the same other conditions, 4 mu of uncultivated soil had a lodging area of 40%, 5 mu of soil cultivated with 2 cun only lodged 5%-10%, and 1 mu of soil cultivated with 5 cun did not lodge at all. From the general situation, all those with soil cultivated about 3 cun can basically eliminate the lodging phenomenon.

Second, seedling pressing. When the wheat seedlings grow to three leaves, press the seedlings once every four or five days, two to three times is appropriate. It should not be too late to avoid breaking the stalks and causing production reduction. The method of pressing seedlings is best by foot or stone roller. The main benefit of pressing seedlings is to make the tillering seedlings catch up with the main seedlings, reduce the difference between weak seedlings and strong seedlings, and reduce ineffective tillering. The reason is that when pressing the seedlings, the growth force of the seedling part is reduced, and the growth force of the root part is relatively strengthened, which can make the root system developed, the plants short and healthy, effectively control steep growth, and enhance the ability to resist lodging.

Third, inserting branches to prevent lodging and inserting branches to support lodging. If the wheat seedlings have already shown signs of lodging, the branches will be shaved into a "fishbone shape" and inserted between the rows to resist level 7 winds. If the wheat seedlings have been knocked down by wind and rain, the fallen wheat seedlings will be supported row by row. As long as they fall and are supported on the same day, they will stand upright after two or three days, just like the unfallen wheat seedlings.

Fourth, thinning ineffective tillering seedlings and removing yellow foot leaves. After close planting, ineffective tillering and yellow foot leaves have a serious impact on ventilation and light transmission. According to observation, the color of the base of the wheat seedlings is tender white before thinning and removal, and it can turn to blue and strong within four or five days after thinning and removal. If phosphorus and potassium fertilizer mixed with sand are applied together, the effect will be better.

Fifth, foliar spraying of phosphorus and potassium has a very good effect on suppressing steep growth, and it also has an effect on strengthening stalks and full grains.

Practice has proved that the methods of driving dew and building sheds to prevent lodging should not be adopted. After driving the dew, the wheat leaves shrink and roll into tubes, and the leaves droop, which is not conducive to growth and development; in the wheat fields with sheds, the leaf color changes from green to gray and presents a state of atrophy. Neither of these two methods is applicable.

    1959年西充县小麦丰产经验
    中共西充县委会
    四川西充县山多土薄，是有名的穷县。全县六十三万亩耕地，水田只占三分之一，旱地中70％左右是一尺以下的薄土。为了适应这种土壤条件，农民过去一直是大春栽红苕，小春种豌豆；极少数坝地才种小麦，产量也很低，解放前平均亩产在一百斤以下。解放后在党的领导下，不断改进耕作技术，小麦连年增产。1958年小麦平均亩产达到一百六十八点八斤，比解放前增长了将近一倍；1959年小麦平均亩产一跃为四百五十二点九斤，比1958年增长一点六倍。这是人民公社化的胜利，农业“八字宪法”的胜利，是人和自然作斗争，以及先进思想和保守思想作斗争的胜利。这些胜利使我们进一步树立了“人定胜天，事在人为”的坚强信念。同时，在领导方法和耕作技术等方面，也初步摸索到一定的经验，为夺取今年更大丰收开辟了宽广的道路。
    “一条龙”的丰产组织
    书记挂帅，依靠先进，带动中间，提高落后，是西充县1959年领导小麦大面积丰收的基本经验。从种到收，我们一直采取了“以丰产片为阵地，以指挥田为核心，带动大面积，突击三类苗”的工作方法。全县共建立五条丰产路，四十一个丰产片，共约十万亩麦田。这些丰产片，一般是以公社党委为主管人，由各级书记亲自指挥战斗，并在片内建立自己的指挥田，从中摸索小麦高产的规律，借以指导整个生产。县委管农业生产的十一个委员，划片包干，一管到底。同时在所有县、区、社、队干部中，推行“干部责任片”的办法，在片内建立试验田，作为指导全片生产的根据。片以下再以生产小队或作业组为单位，组成四千多个麦田管理专业组，实行“划片包干，分组管理”，以加强田间管理的责任制。这样，路以下有片，大片套小片，层层有指挥田、试验田，认真做到了“任务、措施、物资、劳力”四落实，由县到区到社到队，形成了“一条龙”的丰产组织，充分运用了依靠先进、带动中间、提高落后的群众路线的方法来推动生产。在小麦生产的每个环节上，片与片、组与组，相互开展了连环竞赛。通过连环竞赛、现场会等方式开展检查评比，组织社与社、队与队，自查互查，相互促进。尽管如此，但三类地区、三类苗还是经常存在。我们又专门开展了一个突击三类苗的运动，实行固定领导和劳力，要求定期变样。结果使三类苗的面积由20％以上降到5％以下。
    事实证明，要麦苗长得好，需要狠心去抓，并不断发现和培养新的先进地区，树立标兵，让落后地区很快跟上去。哪里坚持执行了这条群众路线的工作方法，哪里的生产就搞得好。因地制宜执行“八字宪法”
    因地制宜贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，是小麦丰产的根本保证。在这方面，我们初步摸出了一些规律。现归纳如下：
    深耕
    西充县普遍采用了三种深耕的方式：①对于土脚较深、土质粘重、土层板结的田块，先起去表土（耕作层），然后深挖死土，混合施上底肥，最后将表土还原。这种办法，可以大大增加翻耕的深度，但速度慢，费力较多；②对于土脚较深，土层疏松的田块，可采取先搬开表土，然后耕套犁，耕完第一犁，将土用掀板或锄头拉开，再犁二道，并采用取前复后的办法，将表土依次盖在死土上，做到不乱土层。这种办法的优点是速度快，费工较少，但深度只能达到一尺左右；③对于土层瘦薄的地块，采取传土和用客土加厚土层的办法，使不到一尺的土层，能加厚到二尺以上。以上三种办法，无论哪种，都必须做到不乱土层和混合施底肥，以便把死土变成活土。
    深耕必须结合施肥。施肥办法一般有两种：一种是分层混合施肥，即在深挖死土的同时，将肥料放在死土上，随挖随混，这种办法能使麦苗均匀吸收养分，促进麦苗生长。另一种是采取分层施肥，经过后来观察，由于粪土隔离，不利于麦苗生长：肥土混合层根群发育既多又壮，纯土层根多但不壮，纯肥层根群生长不好，而且有退化状态，特别是没有充分腐熟的肥料就更加严重。因此，我们认为混合施肥好。
    究竟深耕到什么程度为宜？从小麦的生长情况看，一般是随着深耕程度的增加，根系相应发达，并且随着耕作层的加深而加深。由于根深，根群分布深广，吸收养分多，因而在其他条件相同的情况下，增产幅度有显著差别。但是，深耕也应有限度，根据我们在义兴公社一块深耕九尺的麦地内，冲洗麦根后观察，离麦脚五寸以内，根群相当发达；五寸到一尺处，大根存在细根减少50％；一尺至二尺处，大根减少到30％—40％，细根下降到20％—30％；二尺至三尺处大根稀疏，细根细弱看不清楚；三尺以上麦根极少。由此证明，耕得过深，不仅没有好处，反而影响增产。
    密植
    密植是小麦丰产技术的中心，在这个基础上再争取穗大粒重，高产才有把握。但是，密植必须合理。1958年我县播麦用种量一般是二十五至三十五斤，少数高产田四十至八十斤。从实际生长情况看，在一般条件下，前者基本上能做到上林整齐，密植不倒。但后者刚分蘖就一苗挨一苗，通风透光比较困难，田间操作也不方便；生长后期，不仅穗短粒轻，退化粒也比较多。因此，每亩用种四十斤以上，如果不下特殊工夫培育，高产的把握是不大的。
    在播种方式上，全部都推行了条播。株行距有2×5、（寸，下同）2．5×2．5、3×3、3×4、3×5、3×6、3×7、3×8等规格。根据既要土地利用率大，又要上林率高，还要收成好的标准，对各种播种规格的考察结果是：2×5、2．5×2．5两种规格，通风透光不良，土地利用率小；3×3、3×4也有土地利用率小的缺点；比较适合的是3×5、3×6、3×7三种规格；3×8播幅太宽，中间死苗弱苗黄苗较多。因此，过宽过窄的播幅都是不好的。
    关于垅播、厢播和大小厢的问题。垅播的优点主要是土地利用率高，缺点是不易保水保肥，施肥灌水以后，水肥每每流失到垅与垅间的沟渠，如遇天雨，更加严重；而且在开垅上，即使掌握了东西向的要领，亦有半面苗好、半面苗差的现象。厢播除土地利用率比不上垅播以外，完全克服了垅播的缺点。但厢播又是大厢不如小厢好，小厢通风透光，便于田间操作，施肥、灌水、除虫都能做到家，不致践踏苗子，同时还能精确计算用种，做到密植匀播。
    肥料
    小麦密植以后，没有足够的肥料，高产就没有保证，同时肥料施用的多少、迟早和质量好坏，都会直接影响产量的高低。从我县的肥源来看，一般是猪牛圈肥、草渣、污泥、老屋泥以及其他杂肥，除丰产片外，很少用化学肥料；从用肥数量上看，普遍感到不足。1959年大面积每亩用肥（中等肥料）实际只有一万到二万斤，丰产片是三至五万斤。根据县委指挥片调查，随着深耕程度的增加，每深五寸有一万斤质量较好的肥料，就能保住小麦丰产。在深耕一尺半，用肥三万斤的条件下，管理得好的麦田，亩产一千斤是有把握的。
    有了肥料，还必须注意配合施用。配合的方法有两种，一是自然肥和化肥配合；二是氮、磷、钾的适量适时配合。从实际生长情况观察，自然肥宜多，化肥宜少，很多单靠化肥的麦田，结果都不好。自然肥含有机质多，施后肥效稳定均匀，苗子不易猛长。因此，为了保证高产，应该以自然肥为主，化肥为辅。在氮、磷、钾三要素的配合上，必须掌握“磷施两头，着重前头；钾施中间，着重拔节；氮肥配合，量不宜多”的规律。但要注意，底肥应该是氮、磷、钾三要素齐全的肥料，追肥前期以氮、磷为主，后期以磷、钾为主。在三要素中，磷、钾对小麦增产有较为显著的作用，多使用磷、钾肥，对壮秆、饱粒都有好处。在施肥的次数和比重上，应掌握“重施底肥，分期追肥”的原则，由于肥料足，麦苗从出土起，一直是健壮的，黄、瘦苗极少，而有些底肥不足的麦田，尽管追肥很勤，但追后三、五天苗又返黄，因而底肥能否施饱，是很关键的问题。全县普遍掌握了?针、分蘖、拔节、孕穗、饱粒等五个季节施下追肥，而其中又着重抓住了拔节肥，因为这是确定穗大粒多的关键时期。此外，我们还搞了根外喷磷喷钾和培页岩粉，以增加磷钾肥。
    防倒
    防倒伏是麦田管理的中心。我们本着防重于治的精神，把防倒伏工作贯穿到整个小麦生产过程中。防倒伏的方法，除了深耕匀播、合理密植、巧施肥料等基本措施外，还采取了以下几项比较有效的办法：
    第一、培土垒蔸。在分蘖末期和拔节初期，用页岩粉混细沙进行一次培土垒蔸，厚到一寸以上，个别田块有厚到三寸的，其效果表现在：（1）基部茎秆粗壮坚硬，有壮秆的作用；（2）可以控制无效分蘖，促进株株上林；（3）培土时将苗分开，在短时期内，能帮助通风透光；（4）培土后增加了保水保肥的效果；（5）降低了植株地面高度，增强了抗倒能力。培土应分期进行，每次以培五分左右为宜，过厚了基部节间容易发白变黄，影响麦苗生长。培土时间，以分蘖到抽穗前为宜，过迟了操作困难，且易折断茎秆。培土时结合施些磷、钾肥，效果更大。据义兴公社十二亩高产田块调查，在其他条件基本相同的情况下，未培土的四亩倒伏面达40％，培土二寸的五亩只倒伏5％—10％，培土五寸的一亩全部未倒。从一般情况看，凡是培土三寸左右的，就可基本消除倒伏现象。
    第二、压苗。麦苗生到三片叶子时，每隔四、五天压一次苗，以二至三次为宜，不能过迟，以免折断茎秆，造成减产。压苗方法以足踩、石磙压为好。压苗的好处，主要是使分蘖苗赶上主苗，降低弱苗和壮苗的差度，减少无效分蘖。原因是压苗时，苗部受伤生长力降低，根部生长力则相对加强，可使根群发达，植株短健，有效地控制陡长，增强了抗倒伏的能力。
    第三、插枝防倒和插枝扶倒。麦苗已经呈现倒伏现象的，就将枝剃成“鱼刺形”，插在行间，可以抵御七级大风。麦苗已被风雨打倒的，就逐行把已倒的麦苗扶起，只要当天倒当天扶，两三天后就会直立起来，同未倒的麦苗一样。
    第四、疏无效分蘖苗和打黄脚叶。密植以后，无效分蘖和黄脚叶，对通风透光有严重的影响，根据观察，在未疏未打以前，麦苗基部颜色嫩白，疏打以后四、五天内即可转为青壮，如果把磷、钾肥混沙一齐施下，效果更好。
    第五、实行根外喷磷、喷钾，对压制陡长效果很好，同时对壮秆、饱粒也有作用。
    根据实践证明，不应采取赶露水和搭棚的办法防倒。赶露水后，麦叶萎缩卷筒，叶片下垂，对生长发育不利；搭棚的麦田，叶色由青变灰，呈现萎缩状态，这两种办法都不适用。
