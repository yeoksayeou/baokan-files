    Concentrate
    Wang Pu
    Whether viewed from a department or a region, one of the characteristics of the current technological innovation and revolution is that advanced pacesetters are emerging in droves, and advanced experiences, inventions, and creations are forming complete sets and series. Some people use "a riot of color, a garden full of spring" to describe this situation. It seems not at all an exaggeration. In a vibrant spring garden, among the myriad purples, there are the deepest purples, and among the thousands of reds, there are the reddest. Many inventions and creations in the same type of work and the same process also have their own merits. When the leading departments survey the scenery of various places and widely organize the exchange of experiences, they should concentrate the essence of the entire province, the entire industry, and the entire country to make them complete sets of experiences and technologies, promote them comprehensively, let them blossom in full, and transform the new technologies and new experiences that were originally only mastered by a few people and a few enterprises into new technologies and new experiences mastered by the vast majority of workers in the same type of work and the vast majority of enterprises. Then, the scenery in our innovation garden will be even more beautiful. The Ministry of Coal Industry concentrated the experiences of advanced pacesetters nationwide and summarized four sets of experiences for the safe operation of electric slushers, rapid movement of electric slushers, safe and rapid pillar support, and safe and rapid pillar recovery. The Henan Provincial Basic Construction Department concentrated the experiences of wall-building experts across the province and summarized a set of "Six-Zero Wall-Building Method" including advanced operating methods, advanced tools, advanced labor organization, etc., which is a good start for the serialization of technological innovation. The complete sets of experiences and technologies summarized from the practices of advanced pacesetters nationwide or across the region can not only avoid scattered groping and repetitive labor, but also be more complete and more advanced than the original scattered experiences and technologies. Comprehensively promoting these experiences and technologies will generally improve the production level of the entire department. The Jingxi Mining Bureau calculated an account: after comprehensively promoting the complete set of experiences for large coal mines proposed by the Ministry of Coal Industry, this year's coal output can be increased from the national plan of 1.05 million tons to 1.4 million tons. By the fourth quarter, the existing production personnel can also be reduced by 700 people successively, and the amount of coal mined per shift per miner will increase from the average of 1.658 tons in 1959 to 3.5 tons, which will soon be more than doubled. This is the most powerful proof. It tells us how important it is to select pacesetters, summarize, and promote advanced experiences in a complete way for the high-speed development of production!
    Marxists never regard advanced experiences and advanced technologies as rigid things. The complete sets of experiences formulated by concentrating the experiences of advanced pacesetters still need to be developed and improved. In the process of promotion, every employee should still adhere to the spirit of "eight immortals crossing the sea, each showing their unique talents," give full play to their intelligence and talents, and launch another "riot of color, all flowers competing for beauty" on a new basis. At that time, the leading departments will need to concentrate the national essence once again to set a more advanced and more complete set of experiences and technologies to replace the set currently being promoted. Constantly concentrate the creative inventions of the masses, summarize and improve them, and then take them to the masses to persist, becoming richer, more complete, and more advanced each time. Then, the entire social production level can be continuously, universally, and rapidly improved, and our technological revolution and technological innovation movement can continue to move forward wave after wave.

    集中起来
    王朴
    无论是从一个部门看，还是从一个地区看，当前技术革新和技术革命的特点之一，就是先进标兵成行成阵，先进经验、发明创造成套成列。有人以“万紫千红，满园春色”来形容这个形势。看来是一点也不过分的。在春色盎然的花园中，万紫之中有最紫的，千红之中有最红的。同工种、同工序的许多创造发明，也各有千秋。领导部门纵览各地景色、广泛组织交流经验的时候，集中全省全行业全国的精华，使之成为完整的成套经验和技术，全面推广，全面开花，把原来只是少数人、少数企业掌握的新技术、新经验变为绝大多数同工种工人、绝大多数企业都掌握的新技术、新经验。那末，我们的革新园里的景色就会更加美丽。煤炭工业部集中全国先进标兵经验，总结出电溜子安全运转、快速移电溜子、安全快速支柱和安全快速回收支柱的四套经验，河南省基本建设部门集中全省砌墙能手经验，总结出一套包括先进操作方法、先进工具、先进劳动组织等等的“六零砌墙法”，是技术革新系列化的良好开端。从全国或全地区的先进标兵的实践中总结出来的成套经验和技术，不但可以避免分散摸索重复劳动，而且比之原来分散的经验和技术，更加完整，更加先进。全面推广这些经验和技术，整个部门的生产水平，就会得到普遍的提高。京西矿务局算了一笔账：全面推广煤炭工业部提出的大型煤矿的成套经验以后，今年煤炭产量就可以从国家计划的一百零五万吨提高到一百四十万吨，到第四季度，现有生产人员还可以陆续减少七百人，每个矿工每班的采煤量，将从1959年平均的一点六五八吨提高到三点五吨，即将提高一点一倍。这是最有力的证明。它告诉我们，成套地选拔标兵、总结和推广先进经验，对高速度地发展生产，具有多么重要的意义！
    马克思主义者从来不把先进经验、先进技术看做僵死的东西。集中先进标兵的经验而制定的成套经验仍然需要发展和提高，在推广中，每一个职工仍要本着“八仙过海，各显神通”的精神，充分发挥自己的聪明才智，在新的基础上，再来一个“万紫千红，群芳竞艳”。那时候，又需要领导部门再一次集中全国精华，定出一套更先进更完整的经验和技术，以代替现在推广的一套。不断地集中群众的创造发明，经过总结和提高，再拿到群众中坚持下去，一次比一次更丰富，一次比一次更完整，一次比一次更先进。那末，整个社会生产水平，就能够不断地、普遍地、迅速地提高，我们的技术革命和技术革新运动就可以一浪高过一浪地持续向前。
