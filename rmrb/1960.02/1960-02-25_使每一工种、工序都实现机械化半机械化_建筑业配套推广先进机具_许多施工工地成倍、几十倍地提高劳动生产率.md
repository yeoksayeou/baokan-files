Xinhua News Agency, February 24th: A new upsurge of marching towards mechanization and semi-mechanization has been launched in China's construction and installation enterprises. The appearance of the construction industry, which has long relied mainly on manual operation and heavy physical labor, is rapidly changing.

Since the Great Leap Forward, workers in construction and installation enterprises in various regions have implemented the policy of combining mechanization and semi-mechanization with tool improvement, combining foreign machinery with indigenous machinery, and combining large, medium, and small machinery. They have created tens of thousands of new machines and tools. In the second half of last year, many places further selected and finalized these advanced machines and tools, and matched them into "dragons" according to trades and processes, so that every process of each trade could implement mechanized and semi-mechanized construction. Recently, this movement has developed to a climax, and a new situation of "dragons" competing in dance has appeared on many construction sites in a very short period. Construction enterprises in Jiangsu, Shandong, Harbin, Beijing and other provinces and cities have matched "dragons" for fourteen trades such as bricklaying, woodworking, plumbing, and earthwork. Shanghai's construction department has completed more than 700 teams and groups with matched "dragons," accounting for 66% of all teams and groups in the city. Tianjin's construction enterprises concentrated more than 400 grassroots leaders, technicians, innovators, professors, and students to systematically carry out the work of matching "dragons." Using the city's most advanced machinery, they matched nine city-wide "standard dragons" in steel bar, woodworking, painting, concrete, plumbing, earthwork, plastering, sheet metal, vertical and horizontal transportation. Workers in the construction departments of Heilongjiang, Liaoning and other provinces have further used the method of combining foreign and indigenous methods to create more than 180 production lines and automatic production lines for woodworking, steel bar, concrete, ironwork processing, and sand and gravel loading and unloading.

The result of matching advanced machinery into "dragons" is that labor productivity has been increased by multiples or dozens of times. In the bricklaying trade, the First Construction Engineering Company of Henan Province combined a trowel ash spreader, a brick cutting machine, an electric mortar mixer, a horizontal transportation steel rail, a vertical transportation multi-hoist winch, and a lifting basket scaffold to form a "dragon," which significantly improved bricklaying efficiency. The number of bricks laid per person per day increased from 1,000 to 4,000 to 5,000, with a maximum of more than 15,000 bricks. Harbin Municipal First Engineering Office and Second Engineering Office, using a combination of foreign and indigenous methods, linked the nine concrete pouring processes of stone washing, stone screening, loading, metering, feeding, water supply, mixing, discharging, and transportation vehicles into an automatic production line. Using electric control and remote operation, the work that originally required 84 people was reduced to only 4 people, and work efficiency was increased by 20 times. The steel bar processing workshop of the Third Construction Site of Qiqihar City's First Engineering Company connected a cutting machine, a bending machine, a material pushing machine, a rolling table, and a lifting frame to process steel bars, reducing the number of workers from 39 to 20, and increasing production efficiency by more than one time. Construction and installation enterprises in Nanjing City originally lacked 1,000 workers. After vigorously engaging in the "one-dragon" method, they not only did not need to increase manpower, but also saved more than 1,800 workers.

After vigorously engaging in the "one-dragon" method and marching towards mechanization and semi-mechanization, the appearance of many construction sites has undergone significant changes, creating more favorable conditions for the large-scale promotion of rapid construction. For example, in Henan, after adopting "hanging basket scaffolds" and "inner scaffolds" in the bricklaying trade, the situation of scaffolding forests on construction sites has been fundamentally changed; "hanging basket scaffolds" can be raised and lowered flexibly, thus changing the situation of masons bending over to lay bricks for thousands of years. Workers said: "This is another liberation for bricklaying workers." The automatic concrete pouring production line that appeared in Harbin City turns heavy work into operation with buttons and instruments, further showing the prospects for the development of the construction industry. At present, in order to comprehensively break through the five trades of bricklaying, steel bar, concrete, plastering, and hoisting, which involve more physical labor, and the two links of earthwork and transportation, construction and installation enterprises across the country are further promoting the experience that has been gained. Many teams and groups that have already been matched into "dragons" are looking for new weak links and guiding the masses to continue to create and invent. The technical innovation movement in many regions has developed to all aspects of construction technology, labor organization, and site layout. The reform of these aspects will give full play to the efficiency of mechanization. (Attached picture)

    使每一工种、工序都实现机械化半机械化
    建筑业配套推广先进机具
    许多施工工地成倍、几十倍地提高劳动生产率
    新华社24日讯　我国建筑安装企业掀起了向机械化半机械化进军的新高潮。长期以来主要用手工操作、笨重体力劳动很多的建筑业的面貌，正在迅速改观。
    大跃进以来，各地建筑安装企业职工贯彻机械化半机械化和改良工具相结合、洋机械和土机械相结合、大中小型机械相结合的方针，创造出了成千上万种新的机械和工具。去年下半年，许多地方进一步把这些先进机具，经过选型、定型，按工种工序配套成“龙”，使各个工种的每一道工序都能实行机械化、半机械化施工。最近，这一运动更向高潮发展，许多工地在很短的时间内就出现了群“龙”竞舞的新局面。江苏、山东、哈尔滨、北京等省市建筑企业已有砌砖、木作、水暖、土方等十四个工种配成了“龙”。上海市建筑部门完成配套成“龙”的队、组有七百多个，占全市全部队组的66％。天津市建筑企业集中基层领导干部、技术人员、革新者、教授、学生等四百多人，系统进行配套成“龙”工作，用全市最先进的机具，在钢筋、木作、油漆、混凝土、水暖、土方、抹灰、白铁、垂直和水平运输等方面，配成了九条全市的“标准龙”。黑龙江、辽宁等省建筑部门职工更用洋土结合的办法，在木工、钢筋、混凝土、铁活加工、砂石装卸等工种的工程上，制成了一百八十多条生产联动线和生产自动线。
    先进机具配套成龙的结果，成倍或几十倍地提高了劳动生产率。河南省第一建筑工程公司在砌砖工种中，将撮瓢铺灰器、砍砖器、电动砂浆拌和机、水平运输钢筋轨道、垂直运输一机多吊卷扬机，和可以升降的吊篮脚手等组成一条“龙”，使砌砖效率显著提高。由原来每人每日砌一千块砖提高到砌四千至五千块砖，最高达到一万五千多块砖。哈尔滨市政第一工程处和第二工程处，用土洋结合的办法，把洗石、筛石、上料、计量、投料、给水、搅拌、吐料、运输车九道混凝土浇灌工序联成一条自动生产线，用电动控制、远距离操纵，使原来需要八十四个人做的工作减少到只用四个人，工效提高二十倍。齐齐哈尔市第一工程公司三工地钢筋加工车间，用切断机、弯曲机、赶料机、滚料台、提料架联结起来，加工钢筋，使工人由原来的三十九人减少为二十人，生产效率提高一倍多。南京市建筑安装企业原来缺少一千名工人，经过大搞“一条龙”，结果不仅不要增人，反而节省了一千八百多名劳动力。
    大搞“一条龙”，向机械化半机械化进军以后，许多建筑工地面貌发生显著变化，为大面积地推行快速施工创造了更为有利的条件。例如河南在砌砖工种中采用“吊篮脚手”和“里脚手”后，从根本上改变了建筑工地脚手架林立的状况；“吊篮脚手”可以灵活地升降，因而千百年来瓦工砌砖时弯腰弓背的情况改变了，工人们说：“这是砌砖工人的又一次解放。”哈尔滨市出现的混凝土浇灌自动生产线，把笨重工作变为用电钮和仪表操纵，更展示出了建筑业发展的前景。现在，全国建筑安装企业为了全面突破体力劳动较多的砌砖、钢筋、混凝土、抹灰、吊装五个工种和土方、运输两个环节，正在进一步推广已经取得的经验。许多已经配套成“龙”的队、组，正在寻找新的薄弱环节，引导群众继续创造发明。许多地区的技术革新运动已经发展到施工工艺、劳动组织、现场布置等各个方面。这些方面的改革，将更加充分地发挥机械化的效率。（附图片）
