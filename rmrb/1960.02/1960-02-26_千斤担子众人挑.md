A Thousand-Pound Burden for Everyone to Carry
By People's Daily Commentator

The "Three Guarantees and One Reward" (guaranteed work, guaranteed output, guaranteed cost, and rewards for exceeding production targets) is a fundamental responsibility system and planned management system in our socialist agricultural production. It was effective during the period of agricultural production cooperatives and has been further developed since communization. Currently, the nationwide upsurge in spring plowing preparation has spread from south to north, and the spring plowing high tide is about to arrive. Conscientiously and comprehensively carrying out the preparation for plowing and spring plowing work is of decisive significance for a better and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production this year. To this end, many effective measures must be taken, and "Three Guarantees" implementation down to the team level is one of the most important of these measures. However, it must be pointed out that "Three Guarantees" implementation down to the team level is fundamentally different from "contracting output to individual households." "Contracting output to individual households" was a method by which right-leaning opportunists attempted to drag the collective economy back to the individual economy last year; while "Three Guarantees" implementation down to the team level is a responsibility system within collective management. Therefore, only by assigning the output, cost, and labor usage of various crops to the team can the broad masses of commune members have clear goals, be well-informed, and thus better mobilize everyone's enthusiasm and initiative.

Currently, many regions have noticed this problem; many regions have grasped it relatively tightly and promptly, and have already implemented the "Three Guarantees" targets down to the production team. However, some places emphasize that the current spring plowing preparation work is very busy, fearing it will affect production, and have not well grasped the "Three Guarantees" work. In fact, precisely because spring plowing preparation production is busy, the work of implementing the "Three Guarantees" should be done more quickly and better. The problem is very obvious: effectively and conscientiously doing the work of implementing the "Three Guarantees," so that everyone is responsible for specific tasks, and everything has a dedicated person, and the masses have clear goals to strive for, and jointly shoulder the burden of production, will instead achieve being busy without being chaotic; and it can have an immediate effect on promoting current production.

Implementing the "Three Guarantees" itself is an important working method for implementing the mass line. Therefore, only by launching a large-scale mass movement can this work be done quickly and well. The People's Daily today publishes the experience of Laifeng County, Hubei, in adopting the method of launching a large-scale mass movement, where all 154 production teams in the county completed the "Three Guarantees" work in ten days, achieving satisfaction among commune members and cadres, with everyone having clear responsibilities. The broad masses of commune members know the total income, total output, wage supply, excess production rewards, and increased production measures of the production team's various crops a year in advance, with a clear understanding. The most important point of this experience is to trust the masses and boldly mobilize them. They used the occasion of the county holding a ten-thousand-person conference, the commune holding a thousand-person conference, and the production team holding a hundred-person conference to bring the "Three Guarantees" work down to the grassroots level and meet directly with the masses. This can avoid the phenomenon of layers of assigning targets, layers of revising targets, and the failure to quickly implement the "Three Guarantees" that occurred in some places in the past.

The central link of the "Three Guarantees" is guaranteeing output. Guaranteeing output must be carried out in the spirit of going all out and leaving room for maneuver; it must be advanced and reliable, and neither too high nor too low. If the output target is set too high, and the production team has no surplus to exceed, it will dampen the enthusiasm of the commune members. If the target is set too low, and it can be achieved without much effort, it will also fail to mobilize the enthusiasm of the commune members. The correct method should be to fully mobilize the masses, analyze various increased production conditions, tap the potential for increased production in all aspects, improve the confidence of the masses, and formulate output targets that are both positive and advanced, meet the requirements of the continued Great Leap Forward, and are also practical and reliable. Generally speaking, the output target should be slightly lower than the planned target. Guaranteeing work and guaranteeing cost should be done according to the needs of the plan. The labor quota in guaranteeing work should be the average advanced quota that has been achieved through last year's production practice, taking into account the new conditions of vigorously carrying out tool reforms this year, and the old quota of the past cannot be mechanically applied.

Setting advanced and reliable output targets is a prerequisite for carrying out the excess production movement well. After the "Three Guarantees" are implemented, the communes in various localities should help the production teams tap increased production measures from various aspects, formulate plans for exceeding output, turn excess production plans into the actual actions of the masses, and promote the current preparation for plowing and spring plowing movement.

Time is pressing, and the busy spring plowing will arrive in an instant. Party committees at all levels must seize the opportunity and strengthen leadership over the "Three Guarantees" work. In carrying out the major inspection of spring plowing preparation in various localities, the "Three Guarantees" work must be taken as a major inspection content. Before spring plowing, it is necessary to ensure that the "Three Guarantees" are implemented down to the team in every commune, the measures are implemented in the fields, and the responsibilities are implemented to the individual, so as to fully develop the enthusiasm of each production team and each commune member, and better complete the preparation for plowing work.

    “三包一奖”（包工、包产、包成本和超产奖励）是我们社会主义农业生产中一项基本的责任制度和计划管理制度，不仅在农业生产合作社时期行之有效，公社化以后更有了进一步的发展。当前全国备耕高潮已经由南到北普遍展开，春耕高潮也即将到来。切实全面地做好备耕和春耕工作，对于今年农业生产更好更全面的跃进有着决定性的意义。为此，就要采取许多有效的措施，而“三包”落实到队就是其中最主要的措施之一。但是，必须指出：“三包”到队和“包产到户”有着本质的区别。“包产到户”是去年右倾机会主义分子企图把集体经济拉回到个体经济的作法；而“三包”到队是集体经营中的一种责任制度。因此，只有把各种作物的产量、成本和用工量包到队，才能使广大社员目标明确，心中有数，从而更好地调动起大家的积极性和主动性。
    现在，不少地区已经注意到这个问题；很多地区抓得比较紧，比较及时，已经将“三包”指标落实到生产队。但还有些地方强调当前备耕工作十分繁忙，怕影响生产，没有很好抓紧“三包”工作。其实，正因为备耕生产忙，才应该更快更好地作好“三包”落实的工作。问题是很明显的，切切实实将“三包”落实工作做好，使人人专责，事事有专人，群众心中有了明确的奋斗目标，共同把生产的担子担当起来，反而会做到忙而不乱；对于推动当前生产，更可以立竿见影。
    “三包”落实本身是贯彻群众路线的一项重要的工作方法，因此，也只有通过大搞群众运动，才能把这项工作做得又快又好。本报今天发表的湖北来凤县采取大搞群众运动的办法，全县一百五十四个生产队在十天内全部结束三包工作，做到社员和干部人人满意，个个职责分明。广大社员对于生产队的各项作物的总收入、总产量、工资供给、超产奖励、增产措施等都做到一年早知道，心中有底码。这一经验的最主要的一点是相信群众，放手发动群众。他们运用县召开万人大会、公社召开千人大会、生产队召开百人大会的时机，将“三包”工作一竿子插到底，和群众直接见面。这就可以避免过去有些地方层层分配指标、层层修订指标，和“三包”不能迅速落实的现象。
    “三包”的中心环节是包产。包产必须本着鼓足干劲，而又留有余地的精神进行；既要先进，又要可靠，不可偏高偏低。包产指标如果定得太高，生产队无产可超，就会挫伤社员的积极性。指标如果定得太低，不用什么努力就可以实现，也无法调动社员的积极性。正确的办法应当是充分发动群众，分析各项增产条件，挖掘各方面的增产潜力，提高群众的信心，订出既积极先进符合继续大跃进的要求而又切实可靠的包产指标。一般说来，包产指标应稍低于计划指标。包工、包成本应按规划的需要去包。包工当中的劳动定额，应当是经过去年的生产实践已经实现的平均先进定额，参考今年大搞工具改革的新的条件，不能硬搬过去的老定额。
    包产指标订得先进和可靠，是超包产运动开展得好的先决条件。在“三包”落实以后，各地公社应帮助生产队从多方面挖掘增产措施，订出超包产的计划，使超产计划变成群众的实际行动，推动当前的备耕和春耕运动。
    时机紧迫，春耕大忙转瞬即到。各级党委要抓紧时机，加强对“三包”工作的领导。各地在开展备耕大检查中，要把“三包”工作作为一项主要的检查内容。一定要在春耕之前，使社社“三包”落实到队，措施落实到田，责任落实到人，以便把每个生产队、每个社员的积极性充分发挥出来，更好地完成备耕工作。
