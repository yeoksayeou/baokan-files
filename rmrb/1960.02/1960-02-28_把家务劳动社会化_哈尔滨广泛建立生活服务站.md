    Despite the promulgation of all sorts of laws to liberate women, women are still household slaves because petty household affairs oppress them, suffocate them, make them dull and base, and tie them to cooking and childcare; extremely unproductive, trivial, laborious, dulling, and torturous work takes up their time. Only where a universal struggle against this trivial housework has begun (led by the proletariat in control of state power), or rather, only where the universal transformation of trivial housework into a large-scale socialist economy has begun, is there genuine female liberation, genuine communism. 　　　　　　　　　　	　Excerpt from Lenin’s “A Great Beginning”
    Socializing Housework
    Harbin Widely Establishes Living Service Stations
    (Our newspaper reports) In order to make the family life of the broad masses of workers and staff more fulfilling and happier, so that they can concentrate and devote all their efforts to continuous leaps forward, Harbin has widely established living service stations that take care of household chores for workers, staff, and citizens. As of early February, there are more than 2,400 various types of living service stations in the city, with more than 12,000 service personnel, managing the main household chores of tens of thousands of urban residents.
    The emergence of Harbin's living service stations is a product of the large-scale participation of housewives in social production under the situation of production leaps forward. Harbin, a rising industrial city, has absorbed more than 300,000 housewives to participate in social labor during the Great Leap Forward in the past two years, bringing tremendous changes to the family life of workers and staff throughout the city. After the female workers in Fushun Street, Daoli District, established a service station, the work attendance rate reached 98%, and no one was absent from work due to household chores. Wang Zhenzhong, a worker at Songjiang Electric Motor Factory, whose wife also works, used to have to do some housework himself after returning home from the night shift, which prevented him from resting well and affected his work energy. Now that the service station takes care of household chores, he is able to participate in the technical innovation movement with full energy. He has reformed six kinds of tools successively and has been repeatedly rated as a red banner bearer.
    After the establishment of the living service stations, even more female labor force was further liberated to participate in production, create wealth for society, and increase personal income. After the establishment of a service station in Xinxing Street, Daowai District, several hundred female laborers were sent to the industrial production front. 131 women who could not completely separate themselves from household chores also participated in the work of the service station, taking care of their own household chores while also serving the masses. According to a typical survey in Xiangfang District, due to the establishment of service stations and the development of corresponding service undertakings, the number of people participating in social labor has increased. In 1959, the average income of residents increased by 25% compared with 1958.
    The living service stations, which are mainly composed of street women living among the masses, understand the changing needs of the masses better than state-owned commercial departments. At the same time, the service stations constantly visit residents to understand the specific requirements of the masses, so that state-owned commercial departments can more systematically meet the needs of the masses. The service stations sell a portion of daily necessities on behalf of state-owned commercial departments, and a large number of New Year and festival supplies are delivered to homes. This solves the problem of the shortage of state-owned commercial networks due to the rapid increase in people's purchasing power, and also brings great convenience to the masses. In 1959, the commodities supplied to citizens by the Harbin service stations accounted for 20% of the city's total retail sales; the commodities supplied during festivals accounted for about 80%. More meaningfully, the service stations also renovate old clothes that people used to think were no longer usable, turning them into items that can continue to be used. Last year alone, the service stations renovated more than 2 million quilts and clothes for residents.
    The service stations are even more active in delving into the families of each service recipient, handling most of the household chores from eating to wearing, from living to using. Whenever a worker or staff member has something to do every day, as long as they leave a note before going to work, the service station will help to get it done. Buying train tickets, sending and receiving letters, depositing and withdrawing money, picking up and delivering repaired furniture and utensils, washing clothes, or making clothes, the service station is responsible for handling everything, and even selling waste products such as broken copper, scrap iron, and broken glass. For families where both husband and wife work and no one cleans the room, the service staff can help them boil water, sweep the room, arrange and beautify the home. Some service stations also serve as resident health stations, equipped with daily medicines. If someone in the resident gets a minor illness, the service staff helps with treatment. The service staff is also responsible for taking care of patients, going to the hospital to register, getting medicine, and making meals for patients. Many service stations also run canteens and nurseries. In order to take care of workers and staff who have different work schedules and different work situations, the meal times in these canteens are arranged for a relatively long time. The nurseries accept children for full-day care, as well as children who are temporarily sent for only a few hours.
    Since the service stations take care of most of the household chores, they free up more time for workers, staff, and citizens to study culture, and cultural life becomes richer. After the residents of the Fifth Residents' Committee of Tongtian Street, Xiangfang District, established a service station, the number of newspaper subscribers increased by 186%, and the number of people learning culture increased eightfold. After the service station was established in the staff dormitory of the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, many workers and staff can have one to two hours of theoretical study at home every day. The living service stations also take guaranteeing the cultural life of workers and staff as part of their service content. They subscribe to books and newspapers for workers and staff, borrow books from public libraries, and buy theater tickets on their behalf.
    The service stations, which comprehensively organize the people's economic life, have changed the self-service method of self-cooking, self-eating, self-making, and self-using in the past, so that residents have received more collective life training. At the same time, the service station is an organization with mass mutual assistance, and a considerable part of the labor is uncompensated. This plays a significant role in promoting the growth of people's communist moral qualities. In many residential courtyards, single workers or "double-income" workers (both husband and wife work) go to work, and the women and service staff in the same courtyard wash clothes and sew quilts for them, take care of patients, and take care of children. After work, the workers and staff in the No. 2 Courtyard of Chunhua Street always take some time to help the service staff, and study the technical innovation of housework with the service staff.

### 把家务劳动社会化  哈尔滨广泛建立生活服务站

    尽管颁布了种种解放妇女的法律，但妇女仍然是家庭奴隶，因为琐碎的家庭事务压迫她们，窒息她们，使她们愚钝卑贱，把她们缠在做饭管小孩的事情上；极端非生产性的、琐碎的、劳神的、使人愚钝的、折磨人的工作占去了她们的时间。只有在反对这种琐碎家务的普遍斗争（为掌握国家权力的无产阶级所领导的）开始了的地方，更确切地说，只有在开始把琐碎家务普遍改造为社会主义大经济的地方，才有真正的妇女解放，才有真正的共产主义。　　　　　　　　　　	　节自列宁“伟大的创举”
    把家务劳动社会化
    哈尔滨广泛建立生活服务站
    本报讯　为了使广大职工的家庭生活更为美满、幸福，以便全神贯注、全力以赴地持续跃进，哈尔滨广泛地建立了替职工、市民代管家务的生活服务站。截至2月上旬，全市已有两千四百多处各种类型的生活服务站，拥有服务人员一万二千多人，管理着几万户城市居民的主要家务劳动。
    哈尔滨市生活服务站的出现，是在生产跃进的形势下大批家庭妇女参加社会生产的产物。新兴的工业城市哈尔滨在两年来的大跃进中，吸收了三十几万家庭妇女参加社会劳动，给全市职工家庭生活带来了巨大的变化。道里区抚顺街的女职工，成立了服务站后，工作出勤率达到98％，再没有人因为家务事影响上班。松江电机厂工人王振中，家里的妇女也工作，过去他上完夜班回到家里，就必须自己做一点家务事，不能很好地休息，影响了工作精力。现在有服务站代管家务，他就能够精神饱满地参加技术革新运动。先后改革了六种工具，连续被评为红旗手。
    生活服务站建立后，又进一步解放了更多的妇女劳动力参加生产，为社会创造财富，使个人增加收入。道外区新兴街在成立服务站后，又给工业生产战线上输送去几百名妇女劳动力，一百三十一个不能完全脱开家务的妇女，也参加了服务站的工作，一面照顾自己的家务，一面又为群众服务。据香坊区的典型调查，由于服务站建立和相应的服务事业发展，参加社会劳动的人增多，1959年居民的平均收入比1958年增加了25％。
    以生活在群众中的街道妇女为主组成的生活服务站，比国营商业部门更为了解群众需要的变化。同时服务站又不断访问居民，了解群众的具体要求，使国营商业部门能更有计划地满足群众的需要。服务站为国营商业部门代销一部分日用品，大量的过年过节的用品，采取送货上门的办法；这就解决了因人民购买力迅速增加、国营商业网显得不足的问题，而且带给群众很大的方便。1959年哈尔滨市经服务站代销供应市民的商品，占全市商品零售总额的20％；节日供应的商品，占80％左右。更有意义的是，服务站还把过去人们认为不能再用的衣物，代为整旧翻新，变为能继续使用的物品。去年一年，服务站单是为居民整旧翻新的被子和衣服，就有二百多万件。
    服务站更大量的活动，是深入到每一个服务对象的家庭，操持从吃到穿、从住到用大部分的家务。每一家职工每天有什么事要办，只要在上班前留下一个条子，服务站就会帮助办好。买车票、收寄信件、存款取款、取送修修补补的家具、器皿、浆洗衣裳或是做衣裳，服务站都负责代为办理，甚至卖掉破铜烂铁碎玻璃之类的废品，服务站也能代办。夫妇双方都工作没有人收拾房间的家庭，服务员可以代他们打开水、扫房间，布置和美化家庭。有的服务站还兼做居民卫生站的工作，配备有日常的药品，居民中有人得了小病，服务员就帮助治疗。服务员还负责照顾病人，代他们到医院去挂号、取药、做病号饭。许多服务站还办了食堂和托儿站。为了照顾上下班时间不同，工作情况不一样的职工，这些食堂开饭的时间安排的都比较长。托儿站接受全天整托的孩子，也接受临时送来只托几个小时的孩子。
    由于服务站代管了大部分的家务，给职工和市民腾出了更多的学习文化的时间，文化生活愈加丰富。香坊区通天街第五居民委员会的居民们，成立服务站后，订报户增加了186％，学文化的人增加了八倍。省总工会职工宿舍成立了服务站后，很多职工在家里每天能有一个到两个小时学习理论。生活服务站也把保证职工的文化生活，当做自己的服务内容。他们代职工订书报、到公共图书馆里借书、代买戏票。
    全面组织人民经济生活的服务站，改变了过去一家一户自炊自食、自做自用的自我服务方式，使居民受到了更多的集体生活的锻炼。同时服务站是一个带有群众互助的组织，相当一部分劳动是不计报酬的。这对促进人们共产主义道德品质的成长，起着显著作用。在很多居民大院里，独身职工或“双职工”（夫妇都工作）上班了，同院的妇女和服务员一起，给他们洗衣服、缝被褥。照看病人，代管小孩。纯化街二号大院的职工们，下班后总要抽点时间帮助服务员工作，和服务员一起研究家务劳动的技术革新。（附图片）
