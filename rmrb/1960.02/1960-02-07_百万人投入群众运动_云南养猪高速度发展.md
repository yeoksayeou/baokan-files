Millions Participate in Mass Movement
Yunnan Develops Hog Raising at High Speed

(Our Dispatch) Yunnan Province, with the same determination and vigor as it has displayed in grasping grain production and water conservancy, has launched a mass upsurge to strive for high-speed development of hog production. Currently, over one million people across the province are breaking through barriers in hog feed, infrastructure construction, complacency, and disease prevention. By the end of last year, the number of hogs in stock throughout the province had reached over 7 million, an increase of 10.6% compared to the third quarter of 1959. 70% to 80% of the 1.2 million sows of breeding age are pregnant. One county, twenty-three communes, and one thousand four hundred and thirty production teams across the province have achieved one hog per person; one commune and four hundred and fifty-nine production teams have achieved one hog per mu of land. Averaged across the province's population, there is now one hog for every three people.

Yunnan Province has favorable conditions for hog raising. The climate in many places is spring-like year-round, allowing for the planting of feed crops and the collection of wild fodder throughout the year. Sows can be bred year-round.

To promote in-depth hog raising, the more than 1,000 communes in various counties have convened on-site meetings based on existing problems. They have also used newspapers, radio, and other forms of media to resolve issues such as whether collective hog raising can develop at high speed and whether hogs can be raised on a large scale with limited grain. At the same time, advanced experiences were studied and promoted. The Changning County Party Committee, at an on-site meeting in the Wangang Management District of the Xinjie People's Commune, summarized the experience of the Huachenzhai pig farm in this management district, which had doubled its number of hogs in less than half a year. This proved that collective hog raising develops the fastest, and collectively raised sows can produce more piglets due to timely breeding. In just over four months, the number of hogs increased from forty-two to eighty-five. Piglets generally grow to more than thirty catties within three months, which is about a quarter faster than when raised separately. The Tengziao Management District of the Reshui Commune in Xuanwei is a poor mountain village with steep slopes and many stones. The members of this management district mainly rely on more than 220 kinds of wild fodder to feed their hogs, which has enabled the rapid development of the number of hogs. Now, there are an average of more than seventeen hogs per household, plus other livestock, averaging more than thirty heads per household.

After the launch of the mass movement for hog raising, Yunnan implemented the policy of "public raising as the mainstay, with both public and private raising, walking on two legs." Communes, management districts, production teams, members, and organs above the county level, state-owned farms, and troops all raised hogs. To strengthen leadership, all ninety-five counties and most communes in the province established livestock departments under the county party committees or livestock sections under the county people's committees. Now, each people's commune plans to raise an average of more than 500 hogs, and each management district plans to raise an average of more than 200 hogs. A large number of cadres have been selected and sent to run pig farms. In Yuxi Prefecture, more than 70,000 cadres have been sent down to pig farms to raise hogs and lead hog raising. They are both feeders, veterinarians, and breeders. This force has played a significant role in the development of hog raising and animal husbandry throughout the province.

The key to high-speed development of hog raising is solving the feed problem. The people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan, with soaring revolutionary vigor, have adopted measures that combine professional teams with mass shock tactics and combine long-distance reclamation with short-distance reclamation. They have dispatched more than one million laborers and more than 200,000 head of cattle to form a reclamation army, seizing farmland from wasteland, high mountains, and large lakes, striving to establish a 3 million mu feed base. These large-scale feed bases, calculated at a minimum of three hogs raised per mu, can raise 9 million hogs, which is roughly close to the number of hogs the province plans to increase this year. In addition, the traditional methods of using by-products of agricultural and sideline products and collecting wild fodder can completely solve the feed problem in the large-scale development of hogs. According to statistics from Yuxi, Qujing, Chuxiong and other prefectures (autonomous prefectures): combined with land reclamation, more than 990,000 mu of high-yield feed crops and more than 2.68 million ponds of foreign loofah have been planted. Various places have also made full use of Yunnan's rich and favorable conditions for wild fodder, seizing the time to collect wild fodder, bringing back what is found in the mountains, scooping up what is found in the lakes, picking up what is found on the ground, and picking what is found in the trees, so that there is storage in idle times for busy times. Through several days of mass shock tactics, Huaning County has already stored more than 10 million catties of coarse and refined feed, an average of 340 catties of feed per hog. Around the Spring Festival, the county will collect and store 100 million catties of coarse and refined feed to provide a material guarantee for the large-scale development of hogs.

To ensure the development of hogs, more than 100,000 people across the province are engaged in large-scale construction, building pigsties in a big way. In Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture alone, the construction teams invested in county, commune, and management district-level pig farms totaled more than 34,000 people, starting construction on more than 1,500 collective pig farms, repairing and renovating more than 17,000 pigsties, and digging more than 13,000 cave pigsties. The Gaocang Management District of the Beihu Commune in Yuxi County mobilized members to offer suggestions and ideas. Members voluntarily lent more than 15,000 unused timbers and more than 280,000 earth foundations, bricks, and tiles, solving the difficulty of insufficient materials for building pigsties and building 1,000 pigsties in six days. While carrying out large-scale infrastructure construction, various places throughout the province also mobilized the masses to engage in large-scale reproduction and eliminate empty pregnancies. By the end of January, Yuxi Prefecture had enabled more than 47,000 empty pregnant sows to be bred in a timely manner, and had selected and retained a large number of healthy young sows. In Tonghai, where the foundation for hog raising was poor in the past, the secretary took the lead, driving all cadres to go deep into pig farms to lead breeding and selection of sows, eliminating the phenomenon of empty pregnancies in half a month. This movement is still developing.

Various places in Yunnan Province have established a responsibility system and a disease prevention network for hog feeding and management, and have trained more than 7,800 mass livestock and veterinary personnel. Various places throughout the province have also engaged in a reform movement of hog-raising tools, trying to use fewer people to raise more hogs.

    百万人投入群众运动
    云南养猪高速度发展
    本报讯　云南省以大抓粮食、水利那样的决心和气魄，掀起了群众性的力争高速度发展生猪生产的高潮。目前全省有一百多万人正大破养猪饲料关、基建关、满怀关和防疫关。全省生猪到去年年底存栏数已达七百多万头，比1959年第三季度时增加了10．6％，一百二十万头适龄母猪已有70％到80％满怀。全省已有一个县、二十三个公社、一千四百三十个生产队达到了每人一头猪；一个公社、四百五十九个生产队达到了一亩地一头猪。按全省人口平均，不到三个人已有一头猪。
    云南省养猪的条件良好，许多地方的气候都是四季如春，一年到头都能种植饲料作物和采集野生饲料，母猪一年四季可以发情配种。
    为了使养猪深入开展，各县一千多个公社还都根据存在的不同的问题，召开了现场会议，并且运用报纸、广播等形式，解决了集体养猪能不能高速度发展、粮食少能不能大量养猪等问题。同时，学习和推广了先进经验，中共昌宁县委在新街人民公社弯岗管理区的现场会上，总结了这个管理区花宸寨养猪场不到半年生猪翻一番的经验，证明集体养猪发展最快、集体养的母猪由于配种及时能多下崽，在四个多月内生猪由四十二头增长到了八十五头；小猪一般在三个月内就能长到三十多斤，比分开养快四分之一左右。宣威热水公社藤子凹管理区是个山坡陡石多的穷山村，这个管理区的社员主要依靠二百二十多种野生饲料喂猪，使生猪的数量发展很快。现在平均每户有十七头多，加上其它牲畜平均每户有三十多头。
    在养猪的群众运动展开后，云南各地都贯彻执行了“公养为主、公养和私养并举，两条腿走路”的方针。公社、管理区、生产队、社员；县以上机关、国营农场、部队都养猪。为了加强领导，全省九十五个县和大部分公社建立了县委畜牧部或县人委的畜牧科。现在每个人民公社平均都计划养猪五百头以上，每个管理区平均养猪二百头以上，并选派了大批干部去办养猪场。玉溪专区已有七万多干部下放到猪场养猪和领导养猪，他们既是饲养员、兽医，又是配种员。这批力量对全省养猪和畜牧业的开展起了很大作用。
    高速度发展养猪的关键是解决饲料问题。云南各族人民以冲天的革命干劲，采取了专业队与群众性突击相结合、远距离垦荒与近距离垦荒相结合等措施，派出一百多万劳动力、二十多万条耕牛，组成开荒大军，向荒坝、高山、大湖夺取耕地，力争建立三百万亩饲料基地。这些大规模的饲料基地，以每亩最低饲养三头计，就可养九百万头猪，大致接近全省今年计划增长的生猪数量。加上历来习惯采用的农副产品的副产物、采集野生饲料等办法，已完全可以解决生猪大发展中的饲料问题。据玉溪、曲靖、楚雄等专区（自治州）的统计：结合开荒已种下高产饲料作物九十九万多亩、洋丝瓜二百六十八万多塘。各地还充分利用云南野生饲料丰富的优厚条件，抓紧时间采集野生饲料，把山上的找回来，湖里的捞起来，地上的拣起来，树上的摘下来，做到闲时为忙时储备。华宁县通过几天的群众性的突击，就已储备起粗、精饲料一千多万斤，平均每头猪已有三百四十斤饲料。到春节前后，全县将采集储备一亿斤粗、精饲料，为生猪大发展提供物质保证。
    为了保证猪的发展，全省已有十多万人正在大兴土木，大盖猪厩。楚雄彝族自治州仅仅投入到县、公社、管理区三级养猪场的基建队伍就有三万四千多人，动工兴建一千五百多处集体养猪场，已兴修和改建猪厩一万七千多间，还挖了土洞猪厩一万三千多个。玉溪县杯湖公社高仓管理区发动社员献计献策，社员自动借出暂时不用的木料一万五千多棵，土基、砖、瓦等二十八万多块，解决了修盖猪舍材料不足的困难，在六天内就建成一千间猪舍。在大搞基建的同时，全省各地还发动群众大搞繁殖，消灭空怀。玉溪专区到1月底为止，已经使四万七千多头空怀母猪及时配上了种，并且选留了大批健壮的小母猪。过去养猪基础较差的通海，由书记带头，带动了全体干部深入养猪场领导配种和选留母猪，半个月内就使母猪消灭了空怀现象。现在这个运动还在发展中。
    云南省各地对猪的饲养管理建立了责任制度和防疫网，并且训练了群众性的畜牧兽医人员七千八百多人。全省各地还都大搞养猪工具改革运动，尽量争取少用人多养猪。
