    U.S. "Aid" is Full of Traps

    "When the United States aids its allies, its primary objective is to use them to serve the interests of American monopoly organizations, and to use them as tools to oppose the world's national liberation movement."
                  —Iraqi "Al-Ra'i Al-'Aam"

    "U.S. aid is the same as joining one or more military defense treaties."
                      —"The Burma Times"

    "The current practice of forcibly requiring 70% of loans to be used for importing American goods will have disastrous consequences. Underdeveloped countries will not be able to benefit from the loans granted to them."
            —Pakistani "Karachi Times"

    "Now the United States government wants to put on a more smiling and kinder face towards Latin American countries, claiming it will increase dollar 'aid,' and even Eisenhower himself will visit South America. But the truth is that increasing 'aid' only means that imperialism is intensifying its control and exploitation of our countries."
                                    —Chilean "El Siglo"

    "American gifts give you bread today, but bring hunger tomorrow."
                              —Bolivian writer, Villarroel

    "...It is necessary to remind some new African countries that may think the United States is the only savior to get Africa out of its economic difficulties... Africa can know what sincerity the United States has from the attitude of Americans towards the black people there. Black people in the United States still suffer from intolerable humiliation."
                            —Nigerian "Daily News"

    美国“援助”陷阱重重
    “美国在援助它的盟国时，首先所追求的目的是利用它们来为美国垄断组织的利益服务，以及利用它们作为反对世界民族解放运动的工具”。
                  ——伊拉克“舆论报”
    “美援同参加一个或更多的军事防御条约是一回事。”
                      ——“缅甸人报”
    “目前这种必须强制性地把贷款70％用于进口美国货的作法，将引起灾难性的后果。不发达国家将不可能从给予它们的贷款中得到好处。”
            ——巴基斯坦“卡拉奇时报”
    “现在美国政府想对拉丁美洲国家装出更带笑容、更为慈祥的另一副嘴脸，声称它将增加美元的‘援助’，甚至连艾森豪威尔本人也将到南美访问。但是确实的情况是，增加‘援助’只意味着帝国主义加紧对我们这些国家的控制和剥削。”
                                    ——智利“世纪报”
    “美国的礼物今天给你面包，明天就带来饥饿。”
                              ——玻利维亚作家　维略洛
    “……要提醒非洲某些可能会认为美国是使非洲摆脱经济困难的唯一救星的新国家。……从美国人如何对待它那里的黑种人的态度中，非洲就能够知道美国有什么诚意。美国的黑人仍然遭受着令人难以忍受的屈辱。”
                            ——尼日利亚“每日新闻”
