    Sum Up Experience and Continue to Leap Forward
    Yang Rui, First Secretary of the Huangshi Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, the industrial and transportation front of Huangshi City achieved a continued great leap forward victory in 1959. The city's total industrial output value increased by about 100% compared to 1958; and production rose steadily, with each quarter higher than the last. Especially after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the mass movement that has flourished since the beginning of the year has been wave after wave.
    The victory on the industrial and transportation front of our city is a victory for the implementation of the General Line, and it is the result of the Party's centralized leadership and the vigorous development of the mass movement.

    Grasp Early, Grasp Tightly, Grasp Specifically
    The phenomenon of being lax at the beginning of the month and tight at the end, lax at the beginning of the year and tight at the end, with sudden rises and falls, and being lax before and tight after, has long existed. Some people believe that this is the "routine" of industrial production, and some even say that it is an "objective law." In fact, this is not an objective law, but an abnormal phenomenon caused by insufficient subjective effort. We have fully utilized the subjective initiative of people and established the idea that "man can conquer nature," thus breaking this "routine" and establishing a new routine of stable production improvement.

    In order to break the old "routine" and ensure the early and over-fulfillment of the state plan, we put forward fighting slogans based on the ideological and production situation of each period, mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. For example, at the beginning of the year, in order to create a good start, we proposed "fire the first shot and avoid production shortfalls"; February had the Spring Festival, with fewer working days, so we proposed "seize the key month"; March was the end of the first quarter, so we proposed "strive for a completely red first quarter"; in April, to prevent complacency and slackness, we proposed "launch a new upsurge, create new miracles, and welcome Red 'May Day'"; in May, to comprehensively complete various economic indicators, we proposed "fight a great battle in Red May and strive for comprehensive redness"; in June, in response to the situation of low quality and many accidents, we proposed "decisive battle in June, quality first." The resounding slogans followed one after another, the masses had a clear direction for their struggle, and they always maintained a strong fighting spirit. Each factory, mine, and workshop generally put forward slogans according to the requirements of the Municipal Party Committee and the characteristics of each period to encourage the masses to move forward. For example, after shaking off backwardness and winning the advanced status in the factory, the forging workshop of Daye Steel Plant put forward the slogan "Strive for the first in the country," which made the idea of striving for the top deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The masses worked harder and more skillfully, and in the third quarter, they finally won the glorious title of first in the country in the steel forging system.

    In order to break the old "routine," while constantly opposing right-leaning thinking, we adopted the method of vigorously developing the mass movement, grasping planning at all levels, everyone grasping planning, and everyone from top to bottom grasping planning. By grasping planning, we mobilized the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. In grasping planning, we also emphasized grasping early, grasping tightly, and grasping specifically. Grasping early means being early rather than late, being ahead rather than behind, looking at the next step while taking one step, arranging the work of the next season in the previous season, and arranging the work of the next month in the previous month, so that the plan is brought to the masses early, the situation is explained, the plan is explained, the key points are explained, and the measures are explained, so that the masses can deliberate early, prepare early, and act early. After the plan has been fully discussed and revised by the masses, we seize the five "firsts," that is, seize the first quarter of the year, seize the first month of each quarter, seize the first ten days of each month, seize the first day of each ten days, and seize the first shift of each day. The shift plan is used to ensure the daily plan, the daily plan ensures the ten-day plan, the monthly plan, and the quarterly plan. Experience has proved that: being early in one thing means being early in everything, and being early in one thing means being good in everything. If you grasp it early, you can prepare early, discover problems early, and solve problems early; if you don't grasp it early, you will be passive step by step. If you are in arrears at the beginning of the month, you will inevitably have a major rush at the end of the month. The more in arrears, the more rushing, the more passive. As the workers criticized us: "Not in a hurry at the beginning of the month, rushing at the end of the month, tiring people and damaging machines, materials cannot be supplied in time, so I have to take a break and rush again next month." This is the reason for being lax before and tight after.

    Grasping tightly means grasping to the end, racing against time. Our method of grasping is: the Municipal Party Committee grasps three times a month, and announces the completion of the plan in the newspaper every ten days. The factories and mines grasp once a day, calculate once every five days, and summarize once every ten days, ensuring that 35% of the monthly plan is completed in the first ten days, 70% is achieved in the middle ten days, and there is a certainty of exceeding the quota in the last ten days. Some units put forward the slogan of action: "Grasp tightly in the first ten days, climb high mountains in the middle ten days, and complete the monthly plan ahead of schedule." The workshops grasp every day and every shift. The work teams grasp every hour, adhere to the arrangement before the shift, the inspection during the shift, and the summary after the shift. In order to complete the plan, the masses carefully calculated the accounts, every moment, some proposed: 60% of the shift plan should be completed in the first four hours, and the extra amount should be guaranteed in the last four hours, so that if there is a shortfall in the first hour, it will be made up in the second hour; if there is a shortfall at work, it will be made up after work; if there is a shortfall today, it will be made up tomorrow. Thus, it is guaranteed that the plan is completed by shift, by day, by ten days, and by month.

    Grasping specifically means breaking down indicators, key points, and measures to work teams, positions, and individuals, so that everyone has a clear task, key points are prominent, and measures are specific, so that long-term plans are arranged in the short term, the more specific it is, the more people are responsible at all levels. On the basis of implementation, leading cadres divide their work and go deep, mobilize the masses, and implement measures. Check diligently, supervise diligently, check problems, check reasons, combine the top and bottom, and solve problems in a timely manner; find experience, find advanced, summarize, and quickly promote. The experience of many units in implementing the plan has shown that: if you grasp it specifically, you will have a clear idea, problems will be discovered from "grasping specifically," and methods will be generated from "grasping specifically," which is an important guarantee for achieving comprehensive redness. Find contradictions, overcome key points, and constantly revolutionize

    The key to production is the contradiction in production; the main key is the main contradiction in production. Constantly overcoming key points can constantly promote the progress of production. This is the objective law of production development. Therefore, grasping planning must grasp key points. Since last year, while grasping planning, we have implemented the policy of combining centralized leadership with vigorous mass movement, grasping key points at all levels, everyone grasping key points, and breaking through production key points. Once the old key points are broken, new key points will emerge. We will attack again and again, constantly attacking and breaking through, and constantly leaping forward.

    The process of overcoming key points is the process of recognizing and solving contradictions. In the key-breaking movement, we grasped two main links: one is to grasp accurately, and the other is to grasp ruthlessly. Grasping accurately means mobilizing the masses to check key points, sort key points, and determine key points. This requires starting from the analysis of the completion of planned indicators, finding problems, finding reasons, and when understanding is not unified, organizing criticism and debate, organizing on-site observation, and after repeated research and repeated sorting, peeling off layers of skin, until the most essential problems are found. Once the key points are clarified, it is necessary to determine people, determine measures, and determine time, concentrate forces, and quickly break through.

    Grasping ruthlessly means taking a fighting stance, making key-breaking a central link, and all other aspects of work should revolve around the center and serve the center. Each factory and mine has a key-breaking headquarters, a key-breaking shock team, and a key-breaking group, which organized a powerful key-breaking team of "three combinations." In key-breaking, leaders go deep into key points, leading the overall situation with key points. Major key points are attacked centrally, minor key points are attacked separately, combined with each other, and bloom in all directions. Break through one batch, then sort another batch, then attack another batch, and so on, cycle by cycle, deepening step by step, improving step by step, thereby promoting the continuous development of production. After five key-breaking efforts, Daye Steel Plant overcame twenty-six major production key points, increasing the average daily steel production level by three hundred tons and then by six hundred tons. After the key to the vibrating screen of Daye Iron Mine was broken, the daily ore supply rapidly increased from three thousand tons to six thousand tons.

    In order to overcome key points, hard work alone is not enough. We must also work cleverly, using both hands and brains. The workers said: "If you use your hands but not your brain, you will sweat profusely; if you use your brain but not your hands, your empty thoughts will lead to nothing; if you use both your hands and your brain, you can strive for the top." They studied diligently, improved tools, improved equipment, and improved operating techniques, so that the high tide of technical innovation and technical revolution naturally appeared, the more prominent the key points, the clearer the direction of the technical revolution, and the wider the mass participation.

    With the development of the key-breaking movement and technical innovation, the management work of enterprises must also keep up closely, which is an objective need for production development. In strengthening the management work of enterprises, we revolved around key points, mobilized the masses, and adopted the method of combining leading cadres, engineering and technical personnel, and workers and masses. On the one hand, we gathered the innovations and creations of the masses, and after experimental research, summary, and appraisal, incorporated them into the operating procedures; on the other hand, we conducted criticism and debate on the original rules and regulations, unified understanding, sorted out and revised them, and insisted on implementation. Every time a major key point is overcome and production is improved, the rules and regulations are revised once. We have broken and established, constantly breaking and constantly establishing, so that the management work of enterprises has been gradually strengthened. At the same time, the strengthening of management work has further consolidated the results of the technical revolution. Experience has proved that: using this method to strengthen enterprise management is not only in line with objective reality, but also easily mastered by the masses. The masses said: "The past regulations were recorded in books, but now the regulations are recorded in my heart; dead regulations have become living regulations."

    Party leadership is the top priority
    The great leap forward victory we achieved last year is, in the final analysis, the result of strengthening Party leadership. In terms of Party leadership, we have consistently adhered to the system of collective leadership and division of labor and responsibility from beginning to end, and in the administrative aspect, we have resolutely implemented the system of factory director responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the principle of Party's collective leadership has been implemented from top to bottom, the awareness of Party members has been improved, the organizational concept has been strengthened, the relationship between the Municipal Party Committee and the grassroots Party organizations has become closer, and the style of communist collaboration in the city has been greatly improved. In our work, we emphasized the need to regularly study and research the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, combine them with our specific situation, analyze the situation, unify thinking, improve understanding, grasp the mainstream, grasp the center, and arrange various tasks appropriately around the principle of "the center drives everything and everything serves the center."

    While strengthening the Party's collective leadership, we also emphasized that leaders at all levels should attach importance to strengthening work teams. Work teams are the foundation of enterprise work, and all work of enterprises directly or indirectly falls on work teams. The more detailed the work team's work, the more in-depth the mass movement will be. An important link in strengthening work team work is to establish the leading core of the work team under the leadership of the Party branch of the workshop, relying on Party members, Youth League members, and production backbones, to help the work team leader improve their leadership level, divide the work and assign responsibilities, and mobilize the masses.

    Strengthening Party leadership is inseparable from thoroughly changing the leadership style. We emphasized that leading cadres should go deep into ideology, go deep into key points, go deep into the masses, participate in production, lead production, discover the main contradictions in production, study and solve them in a timely manner, gather the wisdom and creation of the masses, and persist in it. This has not only improved the leadership but also improved the masses, and has strengthened the relationship between the leadership and the masses, greatly encouraging the labor enthusiasm of the masses. The masses said: "Of all the things, Party leadership is the top priority." Leading cadres said: "Of all the difficulties, it is not difficult to rely on the masses." After the leading cadres of Huaxin Cement Plant changed their style, worked with the workers, and planted experimental fields, the workers reflected that: "They are both teachers and students, both leaders and brothers." After the leaders of Daye Steel Plant went deep into production, the workers said: "If the secretary is on the furnace, there is a way to heaven." Changing the leadership style means not only caring about production but also caring about the lives of the masses. We implemented the policy of grasping production with one hand and grasping life with the other. On the one hand, we educated the masses to establish the idea of long-term production increase and thrift, and on the other hand, we actively took measures to improve the lives of the masses, often going deep into the dormitories, asking about the cold and warmth, which greatly educated and encouraged the masses.

    In 1960, the people of Huangshi City must continue to carry forward the communist style, make great efforts in the technical revolution, and make great efforts in the cultural revolution under the banner of the General Line. We must continue to deeply mobilize the masses, organize new key-breaking campaigns, and ensure that we complete 25% of the annual total output value plan in the first quarter of this year and 50% in the first half of the year, and bravely advance to seize redness every month, redness every quarter, and redness throughout the year!

    总结经验　继续跃进
    中共黄石市委第一书记　杨锐
    在党中央和省委的正确领导下，1959年黄石市工业交通战线上取得了继续大跃进的胜利。全市工业总产值比1958年增长约一倍；而且生产节节上升，一季高过一季。特别是党的八届八中全会以后，年初以来蓬勃发展的群众运动，更是一浪高过一浪。
    我市工业交通战线上的胜利，是贯彻总路线的胜利，是党的集中领导与大搞群众运动的结果。
    抓早，抓紧，抓具体
    月初松，月末紧，年初松，年末紧，骤升骤降，前松后紧的现象，曾长期存在。有人认为这是工业生产上的“常规”，甚至有人说这是“客观规律”。其实，这不是什么客观规律，而是主观努力不够所造成的一种不正常的现象。我们充分发挥了人的主观能动性，树立了“人定胜天”的思想，就打破了这种“常规”，树立了生产稳定提高的新常规。
    为了打破旧“常规”，保证提前和超额完成国家计划，我们根据每一个时期的思想情况和生产情况，提出战斗口号，调动了群众的积极性和创造性。如在年初为创造良好开端，提出“打响第一炮，生产不欠账”；2月份有春节，工作日少，提出“抓紧关键月”；3月份是一季度末，提出“力争首季满堂红”；4月份为防止自满松劲情绪，提出“掀起新高潮，创造新奇迹，迎接红‘五一’”；5月份为全面完成各项经济指标，提出“大战红五月，力争全面红”；6月份针对质量低、事故多的情况，提出“决战6月，质量第一”。响亮的口号一个紧接一个，群众奋斗方向明确，始终保持了旺盛的斗志。各厂矿、各车间一般都根据市委的要求和各个时期的特点，提出口号，鼓舞群众前进。如大冶钢厂锻造车间在摆脱落后，争得本厂先进以后，提出了“力争全国第一”的口号，使力争上游的思想深入了人心，群众劲上加劲，巧上加巧，三季度终于在锻钢系统获得全国第一的光荣称号。
    为了打破旧“常规”，我们在不断反对右倾思想的同时，采取了大搞群众运动的方法，层层抓计划，人人抓计划，上下一齐抓计划。通过抓计划，调动群众的积极性和创造性。在抓计划中，又强调抓早、抓紧、抓具体。抓早就是赶早不赶晚，赶前不赶后，走上一步看下一步，上季布置下季工作，上月布置下月工作，把计划提前拿到群众中去，交形势，交计划，交关键，交措施，使群众早酝酿，早准备，早行动。计划经过群众充分讨论修改之后，我们抓紧五个“第一”，即一年抓紧第一季，每季抓紧第一月，每月抓紧第一旬，每旬抓紧第一天，每天抓紧第一班。用班计划保证日计划、日计划保证旬计划、月计划和季计划。经验证明：一早百早，一早百好。抓得早，就能早作准备，早发现问题，早解决问题；抓得不早，就一步被动步步被动。月初欠了账，月末势必大突击。越欠账，越突击，越被动。正如工人批评我们的：“月初不着急，月末大突击，累人坏机器，材料供不及，只好歇口气，下月再突击。”这就是造成前松后紧的原因。
    抓紧，就是一抓到底，分秒必争。我们的抓法是：市委每月抓三次，按旬在报纸上公布完成计划的情况。厂矿是一天一抓，五天一算，十天一总（结），上旬完成月计划的35％，中旬达到70％，下旬超额有把握。有的单位提出的行动口号是：“上旬要抓紧，中旬翻高山，一月计划提前完”。车间是天天抓，班班抓。班组抓每个小时，坚持班前布置，班中检查，班后总结。群众为了完成计划，人人算细账，时时算细账，有的提出：前四小时完成班计划的60％，后四小时保证超额，作到了第一小时欠账，第二小时补上；上班欠账，下班补上；今天欠账，明天补上。因而保证了按班、按日、按旬、按月完成计划。
    抓具体，就是把指标、关键、措施，分解到班组、岗位和个人，使人人任务明确，关键突出，措施具体，作到长计划短安排，越往下越具体，层层落实，层层有人负责。在落实的基础上，领导干部分工深入，发动群众，贯彻措施。勤检查，勤督促，查问题，查原因，上下结合，及时解决；找经验，找先进，进行总结，迅速推广。许多单位在执行计划中的经验都表明了：抓得具体，心中有数，问题从“抓具体”中发现，办法从“抓具体”中产生，这就是实现全面红的重要保证。找矛盾，攻关键，不断革命
    生产关键，就是生产中的矛盾；主要关键，就是生产中的主要矛盾。不断攻破关键，就能不断地推动生产前进。这是生产发展的客观规律。因此，抓计划势必就要抓关键。去年以来，我们在抓计划的同时，贯彻了集中领导与大搞群众运动相结合的方针，层层抓关键，人人抓关键，大破生产关键。旧的关键突破了，新的关键又出来了。就再攻再破，不断攻关，不断跃进。
    攻关的过程，就是认识矛盾，解决矛盾的过程。在攻关运动中，我们抓住了两个主要环节：一是抓准、一是抓狠。抓准，就是发动群众查关键，排关键，定关键。这就要从分析计划指标完成情况入手，找问题，找原因，认识不统一时，就组织鸣放辩论，组织现场观察，经过反复研究，反复排队，层层剥皮，直到找出最本质的问题。关键明确了，就是定人、定措施、定时间，集中力量，迅速突破。
    抓狠，就是要以战斗的姿态，把攻关破关形成中心环节，其他各方面的工作，围绕中心，为中心服务。各厂矿有攻关指挥部，攻关突击队和攻关小组，组织了“三结合”的强大的攻关队伍。在攻关中，领导深入重点，以重点带全面。大关集中攻，小关分头攻，互相结合，全面开花。攻破一批，再排一批，再攻一批，如此循环，步步深入，步步提高，从而推动了生产的不断向前发展。大冶钢厂经过五次攻关，攻下了二十六个重大生产关键，使钢的平均日产水平增加了三百吨以后又提高了六百吨。大冶铁矿震动筛的关键突破后，由日供矿三千吨迅速提高到六千吨的水平。
    为了攻破关键，单凭苦干是不行的。还必须巧干，手脑并用。工人们说：“用手不用脑，急得大汗流；用脑不用手，空想万事休；用手又用脑，才能争上游。”他们勤学苦钻，改进工具，改进设备，改进操作技术，这样就很自然地出现了技术革新和技术革命的高潮，关键越突出，技术革命的方向越明确，群众性也就越广泛。
    随着攻关运动和技术革新的发展，红旗竞赛也逐步走向深入。竞赛主要是赛攻关、赛技术。关键有大有小，有班组的关键，有车间的关键，有全厂性的关键，解决小的关键要竞赛，解决大的关键也要竞赛。在攻关战役中，群众根据生产发展的需要，创造了对手赛、对口赛、能手赛、技术表演赛、千组万人赛，一条龙协作赛等三十多种竞赛形式，互学、互比、互追、互赶，真是越赛越具体，越赛规模越大，越赛越生动活泼。
    随着攻关、技术革新和技术革命的深入开展，企业的管理工作也必须紧紧跟上，这是生产发展的客观需要。我们在加强企业管理的工作中，围绕关键，发动群众，采取领导干部、工程技术人员和工人群众三结合的方法，一方面将群众的革新创造集中起来，经过试验研究，总结鉴定，纳入操作规程；另一方面，对原有的规程制度，进行鸣放辩论，统一认识，整理修改，坚持贯彻。每攻下一个重大关键，生产提高一步，就修改一次规程制度。作到了有破有立，不断破，不断立，使企业管理工作逐步得到了加强。同时，管理工作的加强，进一步又巩固了技术革命的成果。经验证明：用这种方法来加强企业管理，不仅符合客观实际，而且也容易被群众所掌握。群众说：“过去的规程是记在书本上，现在的规程是记在我心里；死规程变成了活规程。”
      党的领导是头一条
    我们去年取得的大跃进的胜利，归根结底，是加强党的领导的结果。在党的领导方面，我们自始至终坚持了集体领导与分工负责制，在行政方面，坚决贯彻了党委领导下的厂长负责制。党的八届八中全会以后，党的集体领导原则，更自上而下地得到了贯彻，党员的觉悟提高了，组织观念加强了，市委和基层党组织的关系更加密切了，全市共产主义协作的风格大大提高了。在工作中，我们强调经常学习研究党中央和省委的指示，结合我们的具体情况，分析形势，统一思想，提高认识，抓住主流，抓住中心，围绕“中心带动一切、一切服务中心”的原则；适当地安排了各项工作。
    在加强党的集体领导的同时，又强调各级领导重视加强班组工作。班组工作是企业工作的基础，企业的一切工作，都直接或间接地要落脚到班组。班组工作愈细致，群众运动便愈深入。加强班组工作的重要环节，是在车间党支部的领导下，依靠党、团员和生产骨干，建立班组的领导核心，帮助班组长提高领导水平，分工包干，发动群众。
    加强党的领导，与彻底转变领导作风是分不开的。我们强调领导干部深入思想，深入关键，深入群众，参加生产，领导生产，发现生产中的主要矛盾，及时研究解决，把群众的智慧和创造集中起来，坚持下去。这样既提高了领导，也提高了群众，密切了领导与群众的关系，大大鼓舞了群众的劳动热情。群众说：“千条万条，党的领导是头一条。”领导干部说：“千难万难，依靠群众就不难。”华新水泥厂领导干部转变作风，跟班劳动，种试验田以后，工人反映说：“既是先生又是学生，既是领导又是兄弟。”大冶钢厂的领导深入生产以后，工人说：“书记上了炉，登天也有路。”转变领导作风，不仅要关心生产，而且要关心群众的生活。我们贯彻了一手抓生产一手抓生活的方针，一面教育群众树立长期增产节约的思想，一面积极采取措施改善群众生活，经常深入宿舍，问寒问暖，对群众的教育和鼓舞很大。
    1960年，黄石市人民要继续在总路线的旗帜下，高度发扬共产主义风格，大闹技术革命，大搞文化革命。我们要继续深入地发动群众，组织新的攻关战役，保证今年一季度完成全年总产值计划的25％，上半年完成50％，为夺取月月红、季季红、全年红而英勇前进！
