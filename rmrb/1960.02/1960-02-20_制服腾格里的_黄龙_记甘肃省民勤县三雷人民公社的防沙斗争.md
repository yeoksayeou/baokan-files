People's Commune Investigation

　　Conquering the "Yellow Dragon" of the Tengger Desert
　　——A Record of the Sand Control Struggle of the Sanlei People's Commune in Minqin County, Gansu Province
　　The Investigation Team of the People's Commune of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
　　　　　　Disaster
　　Open the map of Gansu Province, and you will find the Badain Jaran and Tengger Deserts lying diagonally to the north of the "Hexi Corridor." These are two of the world's most famous seas of shifting sands. Minqin County, like a wedge inserted into the yellow sea, is surrounded by yellow sand on three sides, much like an isolated island.

　　The commune we are about to introduce is located on the westernmost edge of Minqin County, stretching eighty *li* from north to south, facing the desert completely. The commune has twenty-six production teams, seven thousand eight hundred and eighty-one households, thirty-eight thousand five hundred and seventy-nine people, and one hundred and four thousand and three hundred *mu* of cultivated land, of which twenty-four teams, seven thousand one hundred and sixty-three households, and ninety-one thousand three hundred and ninety-four *mu* of land are often affected by sand damage.

　　In the old society, this was a place full of suffering. Every year from February to May, when the wind rose, the yellow sand rolled, covering the sky and the sun. The sand borrowed the power of the wind, and the wind aided the power of the sand, turning day into dark night. People had to squat in their houses, light lamps, and pray for the "Yellow Dragon" to calm down. But what was the use! As a result, it was still: the sand moved forward, and the people retreated backward. The flat land of one day became sand dunes the next day, and the village of the previous day became a wilderness overnight. According to reliable records, the shifting sand moved forward three to eight meters every year. The local people described the scene of the sand disaster as: "A manor in the morning becomes sand in the evening, not knowing where my home is!"

　　Not long ago, someone dug up many cultural relics from the sand nests near the Sanlei Commune, which determined that many towns and villages had been swallowed by wind and sand in the past. The broken walls and ruins placed on the sand edge of Nanle Village are the remnants of the Touba area. There used to be more than twenty villages, such as Qingsong Fort, Nanle Fort, and Shanshan Fort, with more than two thousand households and more than twenty thousand *mu* of land, almost all of which were swallowed by the yellow sand, leaving only three villages and more than three hundred households. Near Nanle Fort, there is a square broken wall, like a small castle. Judging from the saying "Nanle Fort came before Minqin City" passed down by the masses, this is the ancient Minqin City that was buried by sand thousands of years ago.

　　At that time, what weighed on the people in the Sanlei Commune area were two mountains: one was the landlords and bullies, and the other was the gale and yellow sand. In the era of the bloody rule of Ma Buqing's bandit gang, the people suffered unprecedented catastrophe. The bandits grazed a large number of camels locally and levied firewood and grass according to the *mu* of land, stipulating that each *mu* of land should pay fifty *jin* of firewood and grass, and declared "Minqin people are like walnuts, to be smashed and eaten," destroying the few trees here, which further aggravated the harm of wind and sand, and the people's lives became increasingly impoverished. Poor farmers, unable to withstand the torment of natural and man-made disasters, fled one after another. The tragic scene of "sand dunes pressing down on manors, shifting sand burying farmland, west wind beating the seedlings to death, and hot wind drying up the fields" continued, and people's displaced lives continued....

　　The old society ravaged the peasants, leaving them half-dead, groaning in the abyss of suffering. The Tengger Desert was majestic. People became trembling in the face of nature, never daring to think about how to resist the wind and sand!

　　　　　　Awakening

　　The new China was founded, and the farmers were liberated. The farmers in the Sanlei area beat gongs and drums to celebrate their becoming masters. However, at that time, the sound of the drums was only to bury the old society, not to declare war on the wind and sand. The peasants had no confidence in being the masters of nature, and of course, they did not dare to think about how to conquer the desert.

　　From the day of liberation, the Party knew the suffering of the farmers here and led the farmers to fight against the wind and sand. By 1951, the slogan of eliminating wind and sand disasters was loudly put forward. However, it was impossible to sweep away the shadows of wind and sand disasters left in the hearts of the farmers all at once. Most of the masses believed that "sand is the Yellow Dragon, the more you control it, the poorer you become." In the minds of many people, Minqin was ultimately a "dead place" that would be flooded by sand sooner or later. The Party understood the pain suffered by the peasants for generations, and the pessimistic psychology caused by this suffering for generations. Instead of complaining about the peasants' fatalistic views, they patiently educated them. Therefore, a working method was determined: establishing a banner, starting with the easy and then the difficult, from near to far, typical demonstration, gradually popularizing, and educating the masses. Using this method to lead the masses to plant trees, afforest, enclose sand to cultivate grass, bury and suppress sand dunes, and plant windbreaks.

　　At that time, Xue Wanxiang, a farmer in the Xuebai Production Team, enthusiastically responded to the Party's call, leading his wife, children, and other activists to plant trees along the canals and fields and experiment with sand suppression. Their actions were regarded as overreaching and too rare. Some people not only did not suppress the sand but also stood aside pointing fingers and talking. Some said: "There are so many sand dunes, you won't be able to suppress one sand dune even if your beard turns white." "When the temple is built, the god will be old"; "Planting trees is not as good as eating, why bother so much." These words did not shake the determination of the activists, and they still actively worked hard according to the direction guided by the Party. They went to places four or five *li* away every day to carry mud and suppress the yellow sand, and then planted red willows and *Artemisia psammophila*.

　　One day, the irritable Tengger Desert set off a nine-level gale, blowing away the saplings. People were discouraged and unwilling to suppress the sand anymore. Xue Wanxiang patiently mobilized a few more people to go to the sand dunes. However, none of the people who went with him were enthusiastic, and they planted a few saplings and went home. Only Xue Wanxiang's family of four was left on the sand dunes. The climate in the desert is unpredictable. During the day, the sun bakes the shifting sand so hot that people can't breathe, and their feet are too hot to walk. Xue Wanxiang's family carried soil and suppressed sand day and night, racing to plant saplings. In the autumn of 1951, the Minqin County Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the miracle created by this group of advanced elements, convened a forestry conference, summarized the experience of sand suppression, and rewarded Xue Wanxiang and other forestry labor models. Subsequently, Xue Wanxiang also attended the Northwest District Forestry Conference. After returning from Xi'an, he carried dry food, carrying the pennant awarded by the conference, and walked through various townships, spreading their personally created sand control experience: "One seedling bed per household, no shortage of saplings"; "A thousand willows in the family, no worries about burning firewood"; "Green the beach and plant sand dates, bury and suppress sand dunes and plant *Artemisia*"; "An inch of grass shelters a ten-foot wind, and the sand dunes will never move." The achievements of the advanced elements initially liberated people's minds. Many people began to feel that the "Yellow Dragon" could also be controlled, so they organized sand control groups with shares and dividends and went to the edge of the desert to plant trees!

　　In this way, people set off a wave of sand control. From 1951 to 1953, the Sanlei area planted a total of 19,622 *mu* of trees, enclosed 200,000 *mu* of sand to cultivate grass, and raised 295 *mu* of seedlings; it also tried to suppress 50 small sand dunes. In the face of these achievements, people's confidence greatly increased, and they no longer said "sand is the Yellow Dragon, the more you control it, the poorer you become," but instead felt that "sand is the Yellow Dragon, it won't work if you don't suppress it." This was the beginning of the people's awakening. The achievements of the three years were very small, but they strengthened the courage of the masses and laid the ideological foundation for future greater victories.

　　　　　　Confrontation

　　The agricultural cooperative movement pushed the sand control struggle in the Sanlei area to a new stage: from planting trees along canals and fields to prevent sand to building larger-scale shelterbelts, from trying to suppress small sand dunes to suppressing hundreds of large sand dunes, from simply planting trees to prevent sand to the comprehensive utilization of agriculture and forestry, from the masses originally thinking that "afforestation only occupies land, and the stomach is hungry in autumn" to everyone saying: "The forest belt is a treasure bowl, which not only blocks wind and sand but also produces grain."

　　The organic combination of current interests and long-term interests, agricultural interests and forestry interests, greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses for sand control and afforestation. Relying on the organized strength, people planted 86,280 *mu* of trees, raised 1,858 *mu* of seedlings, and buried and suppressed 952 large sand dunes from 1954 to 1957, freeing 30,000 *mu* of land from the threat of wind and sand. The area within the sand line basically achieved greening, changing the previous situation of only being able to plant autumn crops and not summer crops to having both summer and autumn crops and double harvests, and also began to plant more than 10,000 *mu* of cotton. The grain-deficient area that had suffered disasters every year in history has since become a surplus grain area. Real life made people understand the benefits of being organized.

　　At this time, there were also contradictions in the sand control struggle. There were twenty-six agricultural production cooperatives here, with an average of only three hundred households per cooperative, and limited labor, land, and production tools. In the activities of preventing and controlling wind and sand, it was often the case that: this cooperative planted windbreaks at the head of the field to block the sand, and as a result, the sand ran to the field of another cooperative. That cooperative borrowed the wind to raise the sand, and the sand flooded the farmland of this cooperative again. Because they could not plan uniformly and manage comprehensively, as a result, no cooperative could completely control it, and the wind and sand still seized the opportunity to drill into the farmland. At the same time, because the benefits of each cooperative were different, it also hindered people from attacking the desert with one heart and one mind. The wind and sand line of Xuebai Agricultural Cooperative was as long as thirty *li*, and a large amount of farmland was flooded by wind and sand. People wanted to raise more seedlings and plant more trees and forests, but the land was limited. If they raised seedlings, they would produce less grain, and they dared not make a decision. The wind and sand line of Songhe Agricultural Cooperative was only fifteen *li*, and the wind and sand intrusion was lighter. People planned to afforest on the wind and sand line of Xuebai Agricultural Cooperative to solve their own firewood problem, but because the benefit problem could not be solved, Xuebai Agricultural Cooperative did not agree. Xuebai Agricultural Cooperative wanted Songhe Agricultural Cooperative to transfer a batch of seedlings, but Songhe Agricultural Cooperative could not transfer them because of the need for firewood in the cooperative. At that time, the boundaries of each cooperative could not be opened, and there could be no mutual exchange. And the wind and sand, regardless of the boundaries of your cooperative or township, still rolled in.

　　In the struggle against nature, people naturally generated the demand to establish larger production organizations. Chairman Mao's call to green the motherland further encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses for afforestation. In 1956, they broke the boundaries of the cooperatives and townships; established a joint sand control and afforestation committee; unified planning, planted trees in a planned way, divided sections, and carried out sideline production in the forest. Five agricultural cooperatives, namely Wuxing, Xuebai, Maolin, Songsi, and Gengming, organized labor to plant windbreaks at Wangjialu and Qijiawan sand mouths and built protective forest belts. In this year, the masses in the Sanlei area afforested 28,500 *mu*, buried and suppressed 620 sand dunes, and also carried out sideline production in the forest, with an income of 260,000 yuan. After these years of efforts, the wind and sand no longer moved forward, and the sand damage was stopped. People saw the benefits of "large" for the first time in the joint struggle.

　　People increasingly felt that it was not only necessary to be "large" but also "public." Only by being both "large" and "public" can we fundamentally control wind and sand through overall planning, comprehensively utilize, build sand control forests, timber forests, economic forests, and open up new farmland and pastures, can we carry out mass sand control afforestation and professional management and operation on a larger scale, develop various undertakings in accordance with local conditions, and can we comprehensively develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, fishery, and industry. People knew that although sand damage had stopped, it had not been eradicated. To complete this task, it was necessary to move from the inner line to the outer line, to attack the desert, and to fight for land with the desert. At that time, the difficulty was that there was no such great strength. This contradiction could not be resolved in people's hearts, and the desire to attack the desert could not be turned into action. The Tengger Desert always wanted to take the opportunity to rise, and people wanted to completely subdue the "Yellow Dragon" but lacked the power to attack, thus forming a situation of confrontation between people and sand.

　　　　　　Attack

　　Chairman Mao's instruction that "People's Communes are good" pointed out the road for the people of Sanlei to attack the desert and move towards comprehensive prosperity. The farmers in the Sanlei area were overjoyed and raised the first red flag of the People's Commune in the county on August 21, 1958.

　　The Sanlei People's Commune included the original four townships of Sanlei, Tianbin, Gengming, and Xuebai, with twenty-six agricultural cooperatives. The People's Commune united the people of the agricultural cooperatives into a whole, fully mobilized and rationally used manpower, materials, and financial resources, and raised seedlings in places suitable for raising seedlings, afforested in places suitable for afforestation, repaired canals where canals should be repaired, and dug wells where wells should be dug, solving the contradictions that the agricultural cooperatives could not solve, and organized an unprecedentedly strong force to launch a comprehensive attack on the common enemy - wind and sand - from inner-line defense to outer-line attack. Since then, the sand control work in the Sanlei Commune area has shifted from building protective forest belts on the edge of the desert to planting trees and grass deep in the desert, using the desert to create wealth, from simply planting trees and suppressing sand to introducing water into the desert, transforming the desert, and comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery. The masses have changed from originally thinking that "it is good enough to protect the manor" to "making the desert dedicate its treasures"!

　　As soon as the People's Commune was established, it formulated a comprehensive plan for fundamentally controlling wind and sand on a larger scale, unified the arrangement of 17,100 laborers in the commune, and formed five armies for steelmaking, deep plowing, autumn harvest, water conservancy construction, and sand control. The sand control expeditionary army, composed of more than 6,300 people, held high the red flag and went deep into the desert forty *li*, fighting on the sand dunes during the day and camping in the sand nests at night. After two shock attacks in the winter of 1958 and the spring of 1959, they planted 70,185 *mu* of trees, enclosed 380,000 *mu* of sand to cultivate grass, and nurtured 45,000 *mu* of young forests. The large-scale sand control movement changed the situation of "sand moving forward, people retreating backward" for thousands of years, from the original annual movement of shifting sand forward by three to eight meters to people attacking the desert by forty *li* in one year. At the same time as sand control, all kinds of production were also done very well. In the autumn of 1958, 80% of the land in the commune was deeply plowed, the amount of accumulated fertilizer increased by 40% compared with previous years, the amount of seeding increased from more than twenty *jin* in the past to forty *jin*, and all of them were sown by horse-drawn machines. These reforms in the cropping system were indeed a groundbreaking event for the Sanlei Commune, which was located on the wind and sand line. The commune fully played its role in highly organizing basic farmland construction, timely sowing, management, processing, and harvesting. For example, the spring sowing was shortened from twenty days in 1958 to fifteen days in 1959, and the summer harvest time was also shortened by one-third compared with the previous year.

　　The commune broke the original boundaries of the agricultural cooperatives, unified leadership, divided sections, established twenty-three forest farms, and transferred three hundred and twenty members with rich sand control experience to specialize in sand control and afforestation. The newly organized forest farms had fixed personnel, concentrated residence, which facilitated learning technology; collected tree seeds and grass seeds all year round, and cultivated seedlings, which made full preparations for a larger-scale attack on the desert in the future, and also greatly saved labor and ensured quality. At the same time, the policy of "afforestation and forest protection" was implemented, and the management of irrigation, weeding, and interplanting in the forest was strengthened. The specialization of seedling raising and afforestation has increased the survival rate of tree planting and grass planting from 70% in 1957 to more than 90% in 1959. While building protective forest belts, the professional forest farms began to build economic forests on a large scale. In the autumn of 1958 and the spring of 1959, they cultivated 3,014 *mu* of economic forests such as apples, pears, apricots, peaches, and dates around fixed sand dunes, pressed more than 10,000 grape racks, and interplanted 350 *mu* of food crops, 120 *mu* of melons and vegetables, and 20 *mu* of oil crops in the forest belt. Now the forest farms occupying the forward positions have seven moved into the desert hinterland, built 720 square meters of buildings, new villages have appeared in the desert, and the Shajingzi Forest Farm led by the famous forestry labor model Xue Wanxiang has penetrated twenty *li* into the desert. People have taken back a large area of land from the desert. People said with a smile: "Hey, now it's people moving forward, and sand retreating backward!"

　　The People's Commune has a large organization scale and strong funds, which has created conditions for using advanced tools such as machinery to attack the desert. After communization, while carrying out large-scale manual afforestation, they began to use advanced tools such as airplanes and tractors to sow grass seeds in a large area of the desert. In the autumn of 1958, airplanes sowed more than 50,000 *mu* of *Artemisia psammophila*, *Iris lactea*, etc. in the desert more than twenty *li* outside the Green Great Wall. Generally, the germination was good, with five hundred to eight hundred plants per square meter. Recently, more than 20,000 *mu* have been sown. In 1959, the forest farm used mechanical tools such as tree planting machines to plant more than 300 *mu* of trees. Many people traveled a long distance to visit, and many elderly people shed tears of excitement. Using these advanced tools to fight against natural disasters has further increased the confidence and strength of the masses to launch a comprehensive attack on wind and sand.

　　The People's Commune mobilized 5,500 laborers to jointly build the Hongyashan Desert Reservoir and Yuejin Canal project with brother communes. This desert reservoir can store more than 120 million cubic meters of water. The Yuejin Canal is more than 160 *li* long, passing through deserts and swamps, and must be lined with stones. After these projects are completed in the spring of 1960, they can overcome the drought threat brought by wind and sand and make all the cultivated land in the commune into well-irrigated land. This is a pioneering work for people to conquer sand disasters. The commune also fought hard for twenty days, split ten sand mountains, and built the twenty-one *li* long Second Main Canal, and organized the masses to dig wells. These projects have all played their due role, and in the case of severe drought without rain in the summer and autumn of 1959, the crops were generally watered twice, ensuring a bumper harvest.

　　　　　　Prosperity

　　The people of Sanlei Commune have achieved brilliant achievements in the struggle against wind and sand. The People's Commune has brought them the power to attack wind and sand. It allows them to order the wind and sand to retreat!

　　The long-term goal of "no wind disasters, no southward movement of sand, turning the Gobi into an oasis, and turning the desert into fertile land" put forward by the people of Sanlei Commune in 1952, began to become the reality of life in the first year of the establishment of the People's Commune. Many orchards have been cultivated next to the villages, large areas of *Artemisia* have enclosed piles of sand dunes, and a green Great Wall eighty *li* long stands from east to west on the sand defense front line. The nurseries cultivated by the forest farms in the yellow sand desert outside the forest are full of vitality. This is the outpost for people to prepare for the larger-scale transformation of the desert in 1960. The first phase of the Yuejin Canal project has been completed, wooden boats are running in the canal, and the Second Main Canal has been fully connected to water, turning all 100,000 *mu* of cultivated land in the commune into irrigated land. The Hongyashan Desert Reservoir built jointly with brother communes has stored 110 million cubic meters of water. The Sanlei Commune area is no longer "a big wind and sand fills the sky, and the people cry their hearts out for thousands of years," but "grain and cotton production increases year after year, and the sand villages must catch up with the south of the Yangtze River"!

　　In the first year of the establishment of the Sanlei Commune, a bumper harvest of grain and cotton was obtained. In 1959, the per-mu yield of grain was 401 *jin*, an increase of 16% compared with 1958, and the total output of cotton was more than 624,000 *jin*, an increase of 84.5% compared with 1958. The commune-run forest farm carried out comprehensive forest and sideline operations, with a total income of 1.05 million yuan, equivalent to 85% of the total in the four years after collectivization. With the development of production, the income of the members in 1959 increased by an average of 30% compared with 1958. Xuebai Village, which had only nine households left after the escape before liberation, is now a happy village with more than 400 households, and 85% of the families in the village are living a life equivalent to that of prosperous middle peasants. In the autumn of 1958, the representatives of the on-site meeting on greening the desert in the nine northern provinces (regions) left such praise when they visited here: "Coming to Xuebai Village, everyone is smiling, beautiful flowers can't be seen enough, good fruits can't be tasted enough, the desert wears green clothes, the wasteland becomes a garden, production is greatly developed, and life is as sweet as honey."

　　The year of the People's Commune was a year of great attack and great victory for the people of Sanlei against wind and sand. The irritable character of the Tengger Desert has not changed, and it still often sets off black winds and red winds. However, it is no longer a sacred object in people's minds, but a tameable "Yellow Dragon." People are becoming more and more courageous in the face of the desert. They are now advancing by leaps and bounds towards the goal of "protective forest belts raise silkworms, the desert becomes a vineyard, fruit tree varieties are the best in the world, and high-yield gold medals are listed for grain and cotton."

    制服腾格里的“黄龙”
    ——记甘肃省民勤县三雷人民公社的防沙斗争
    中共甘肃省委人民公社调查组
                  灾难
    打开甘肃省的地图，就会发现在“河西走廊”的北面，斜躺着巴丹吉林和腾格里大沙漠。这是两个闻名于世界的流沙的海洋。民勤县，像一根楔子插进黄色的海洋里，三面被黄沙包围着，很像一个孤岛。
    我们所要介绍的这个公社，又处在民勤县最西的边沿，全社南北长八十华里，完全面临沙漠。全社有二十六个生产队、七千八百八十一户、三万八千五百七十九人、十万四千三百亩耕地，其中有二十四个队、七千一百六十三户、九万一千三百九十四亩土地，常受沙害。
    在旧社会，这是块苦难重重的地方。每年2月到5月狂风一起，黄沙滚滚，遮天蔽日。沙借风力，风助沙威，把白天变成了暗夜，人们只好蹲在屋子里，点着灯，祷告“黄龙”息怒。这有什么用处呢！结果，仍然是：沙向前移，人向后退。头一天的平地，第二天成了沙丘，前一天的村庄，一夜间变成了荒野。根据可靠的记载，每年流沙向前移动三至八米。当地群众形容沙灾的情景说：“朝为庄园夕是沙，不知何处是我家！”
    不久前，有人从三雷公社附近的沙窝中挖出了许多文物，判明过去有许多城镇村庄被风沙吞没了。摆在南乐村沙边上的残垣断壁，是残存的头坝地区。那里原有青松堡、南乐堡、沙山堡等二十多个村子，二千多户人家、二万多亩土地，几乎全被黄沙吞没，只剩下了三个村子，三百多户人家。南乐堡附近，有一个方方正正的残垣破壁，像一个小小的城堡。从群众流传下来的“先有南乐堡后有民勤城”的说法判断，这是几千年前被沙埋掉的古民勤城。
    那时，压在三雷公社地区人们身上的是两座山：一座是地主恶霸，一座是狂风黄沙。在马步青匪帮血腥统治的年代里，人民遭受到空前的浩劫。匪徒们一面在当地牧放大批骆驼，一面按照地亩抽柴要草，规定每亩地交纳柴草各五十斤，并宣称
  “民勤人和核桃一样要砸着吃”，将这里仅有的一些树木摧残光了，这样就更加重了风沙的危害，人民生活越来越贫困。贫苦的农民，受不了天灾人祸的折磨，纷纷逃亡。“沙丘压庄园，流沙埋农田，西风打死苗，热风吹干田”的惨景继续着，人们流离失所的生活继续着……。
    旧社会，把农民蹂躏得不死不活，在苦难的深渊里呻吟。腾格里沙漠，威风凛凛。人，在大自然面前变得战战兢兢，从不敢想如何抵抗风沙！
                  觉醒
    新中国成立了，农民们翻身解放了。三雷地区的农民敲锣打鼓，庆祝自己当了主人。不过，那时候的鼓声，只是给旧社会送葬，而不是对风沙宣战。农民没有信心做大自然的主人，当然更不敢想怎样去征服沙漠了。
    从解放那天起，党就知道这里农民的苦处，领导农民向风沙作斗争。到1951年，响亮地提出了消灭风沙灾害的口号。可是，无法一下子扫清风沙灾害留在农民心上的暗影。大多数的群众认为：“沙是黄龙，越治越穷”。在许多人的心目中，民勤这块地方，终归是一块“死地”，迟早会被沙淹掉。党，懂得农民世世代代遭受的痛苦，以及由于这种世世代代的痛苦造成的悲观心理。对农民的宿命观点不是埋怨，而是耐心教育。于是确定了一种工作方法：树立旗帜，先易后难，由近及远，典型示范，逐步推广，教育群众。用这个方法领导群众植树造林、封沙育草、埋压沙丘、栽插风墙。
    当时，薛百生产队有个农民薛万祥，热烈响应了党的号召，带领老婆孩子和其他积极分子在渠边、地畔种树，试验压沙。他们这种行动，被人看作是不自量力，是件太稀奇的事情。有些人不但不去压沙，还站在一边指手划脚，议论纷纷。有的说：“沙丘多得很，压到胡子白了，也压不住一个沙丘。”“等庙修成，神就老啦”；“种树不顶吃，何必多费力”。这些话并没有动摇积极分子们的决心，他们仍然按照党指引的方向积极实干。他们每天到四、五里以外的地方去挑运泥土，压盖黄沙，然后种上红柳、沙蒿。
    有一天，暴躁的腾格里，掀起了一场九级大风，把树苗刮光了。人们灰心、失望，不愿再去压沙。薛万祥又耐心地动员了几个人向沙丘走去。可是同去的人谁也不热心，栽上几棵树苗就回家了。沙丘上只剩下薛万祥一家四口。沙漠上的气候变化莫测，白天太阳把流沙晒得火热，蒸得人透不过气来，脚也烫得无法走动。薛万祥一家昼夜不停担土压沙，抢种树苗。1951年秋季，中共民勤县委根据这批先进分子创造的奇迹，召开了林业会议，总结了压沙的经验，奖励了薛万祥等林业劳动模范。接着，薛万祥又出席了西北区林业会议。他从西安回来以后，背着干粮，打着会议奖给的锦旗，步行各乡，传播他们亲手创造的防沙经验：“一户一畦苗，树苗不缺少”；“家有千墩柳，烧柴不发愁”；“绿化沙滩种沙枣，埋压沙丘种黄蒿”；“寸草遮丈风，沙丘永不动”。先进分子们的成就，初步解放了人们的思想，许多人开始觉得“黄龙”也可以治一治，便组织了入股分红的防沙小组，到大漠边沿植树造林去了！
    这样，人们掀起了治沙的热潮。从1951年到1953年，三雷地区共植树造林一万九千六百二十二亩，封沙育草二十万亩，育苗二百九十五亩；还试压了五十个小沙丘。在这些成就面前，人们信心大增，不再说“沙是黄龙越治越穷”，反而感到
  “沙是黄龙，不压不行”了。这是人民群众觉悟的开始。三年的成就是很小的，然而壮起了群众的胆量，奠定了以后取得更大胜利的思想基础。
                    对峙
    农业合作化运动，将三雷地区的防沙斗争推进到新的阶段：由渠边、地畔种树防沙到营造规模较大的防护林带，由试压小型的沙丘到成百地压大沙丘，由单纯的造林防沙到农林结合综合利用，由群众原来认为“造林光占地，秋天肚里饥”，到大家说：“林带是个聚宝盆，又挡风沙又产粮”。
    目前利益和长远利益、农业利益和林业利益的有机结合，更大地激发了群众防沙造林的积极性。人们依靠组织起来的力量，从1954年到1957年，共植树造林八万六千二百八十亩，育苗一千八百五十八亩，压埋大型沙丘九百五十二个，使三万亩土地摆脱了风沙的威胁。沙线以内的地区，基本上实现了绿化，改以往只能种秋、不能种夏为有夏有秋、双双丰收，并且开始种植棉花一万多亩。历史上年年成灾的缺粮地区，从此一跃而为余粮地区了。现实生活，使人们懂得了组织起来的好处。
    这时，在防沙斗争中也不是没有矛盾的。这里有二十六个农业生产合作社，每社平均只有三百户人家，劳动力、土地和生产工具都有限。在防治风沙的活动中往往是：这个社在地头插上风墙挡沙，结果沙跑到另一个社的田里去了，那个社借风扬沙，沙又淹没了这个社的农田。因为不能统一筹划，全面治理，结果，哪个社也治不完，风沙仍乘隙钻到农田里来。同时，由于各社受益不同，也妨碍着人们向沙漠齐心协力的进攻。薛百农业社风沙线长达三十里，大量农田被风沙淹没，人们想多育苗、多植树造林，但是土地有限，育了苗，就要少打粮食，不敢下决心。宋和农业社风沙线只有十五里，风沙侵袭较轻，人们打算到薛百农业社的风沙线上造林，解决自己的烧柴问题，因受益问题无法解决，薛百农业社不答应。薛百农业社想要宋和农业社调剂一批树苗，宋和农业社因本社烧柴需要，也不能调剂。当时，各社的界限打不开，不能互通有无。而风沙呢，不管你什么社、乡的界限，依然滚滚而来。
    人们在同大自然的斗争中，自然地产生了建立更大的生产组织的要求。毛主席号召绿化祖国，更鼓舞了群众植树造林的积极性。他们在1956年，曾打破社、乡的界线；成立了联合防沙造林委员会；统一规划，有计划地植树造林，划分地段，开展林间副业生产。五星、薛百、茂林、宋四、更名五个农业社，组织劳动力在王家路、祁家湾沙口插上了风墙，营造了护田林带。这一年，三雷地区群众共造林二万八千五百亩，埋压沙丘六百二十个，还展开了林间副业生产，收入达二十六万元。经过这几年的努力，风沙再不向前移动了，沙害被制止了。人们在联合斗争中初次看到了“大”的好处。
    人们越来越深刻地感到不仅要“大”，而且要“公”，只有又“大”又“公”，才能通过全面规划根治风沙，综合利用、营造防沙林、用材林、经济林和开辟新的农田、牧场，才能在更大规模上开展群众性的防沙造林与专业管理经营、因地制宜地发展各种事业，才能使农、林、牧、副、渔和工业全面发展。人们知道沙害虽然停止了，却没有根绝，想完成这个任务，必须从内线打到外线去，必须向沙漠进攻，与沙漠争田。当时，困难在于没有这样大的力量。这个矛盾在人们的心里得不到解决，向沙漠进攻的愿望不能变成行动。腾格里沙漠时刻想待机而起，人们想完全制服“黄龙”又缺少进攻的力量，因而形成人与沙的对峙形势。
                  进攻
    毛主席提出“人民公社好”的指示，给三雷人民指出了向沙漠进攻的道路，走向全面繁荣的道路。三雷地区的农民欢天喜地，于1958年8月21日，在全县举起了第一面人民公社的红旗。
    三雷人民公社包括原来的三雷、田斌、更名、薛百四个乡，二十六个农业社。人民公社将各农业社人民结成了一个整体，充分动员和合理地使用人力、物力、财力，并在宜于育苗的地方育苗，宜于造林的地方造林，该修渠的修渠，该打井的打井，解决了农业社所不能解决的矛盾，组织了一支空前强大的力量，向着共同的敌人——风沙，展开了由内线防御转入外线的全面进攻。从此，三雷公社地区的防沙工作由在沙漠边沿营造防护林带到深入沙漠腹地植树种草，利用沙漠创造财富，由单纯的造林压沙到把水引进沙漠、改造沙漠、全面发展农林牧副渔，群众由原来认为“保住庄园就不错”到“要叫沙漠把宝献”了！
    人民公社一成立，就在更大的范围内，制定了全面根治风
  沙的规划，统一安排了全社一万七千一百个劳动力，组成了大
  炼钢铁、深翻、秋收、兴修水利和治沙五路大军。由六千三百多人组成的治沙远征大军高举红旗，深入沙漠腹地四十里，日战沙滩，夜宿沙窝。经过1958年冬季和1959年春季两次突击，植树造林七万零一百八十五亩，封沙育草三十八万亩，幼林抚育四万五千多亩。大规模的防沙运动，改变了千百年来“沙向前移，人向后退”的局面，由原来每年流沙向前移动三至八米，到人们在一年中攻进沙漠四十里。治沙的同时，各项生产也搞得很出色。1958年秋天全社80％的土地进行了深翻，积肥量比往年增加了40％，下种量由过去的二十多斤提高到四十斤，并全部使用马拉机播种。这些耕作制度上的改革，在处于风沙线上的三雷公社来说，确实是件破天荒的大事。在农田基本建设、适时播种、管理加工和收割等方面，都充分发挥了公社的高度组织作用。如春播由1958年的二十天缩短到1959年的十五天，夏收的时间也比头一年缩短了三分之一。
    公社打破了原来农业社的界限，统一领导，划分地段，建立了二十三个林场，抽调了三百二十个有丰富治沙经验的社员，专业进行防沙造林。新组织起来的林场，人员固定，居住集中，便于学习技术；常年采集树种、草籽，培育幼苗，为今后更大规模地向沙漠进攻作好了充分准备，还大大节省了劳动力，保证了质量。同时，贯彻了“造林护林”并举的方针，加强了林间灌溉、锄草、插补等管理工作。育苗、植树造林的专业化，使植树造林种草的成活率，由1957年的70％提高到1959年的90％以上。专业林场在营造护田林带的同时，开始大规模营造经济林，1958年秋和1959年春在固定的沙丘周围，培植了苹果、梨、杏、桃、枣等经济林三千零十四亩，压葡萄一万多架，林带里间种了粮食作物三百五十亩，瓜菜一百二十亩，油料二十亩。现在占居着前哨阵地的林场，已有七个迁进沙漠腹地，建筑了七百二十平方米的建筑物，沙漠里出现了新的村庄，著名林业劳模薛万祥领导的沙井子林场已深入沙漠二十里。人们从沙漠那里夺回了大片土地。人们笑着说：“嗬，现在是人向前进，沙向后退了！”
    人民公社组织规模大，资金雄厚，为利用机械等先进工具向沙漠进攻创造了条件。公社化后在大规模人工造林的同时，开始利用飞机和拖拉机等先进工具在沙漠中大面积的播种草籽。1958年秋飞机在绿色长城以外二十多里的沙漠中，播种黄蒿、马莲等五万多亩，一般发芽良好，每平方米发芽五百至八百株。最近又播种了两万多亩。林场1959年用植树机等机械工具，植树三百多亩。许多群众远道前往参观，不少老年人兴奋得流下了泪。运用这些先进工具向自然灾害作斗争，更加给群众增添了向风沙展开全面进攻的信心和力量。
    人民公社调动了五千五百个劳动力，同各兄弟公社联合兴修红崖山沙漠水库和跃进渠工程。这座沙漠水库可蓄水一亿二千多万方。跃进渠长一百六十多里，穿过沙漠、沼泽地带，要全部用石块衬砌。这些工程1960年春季全部完成后，就可以战胜风沙带来的干旱威胁，使全社耕地全部成为足水地。这是人们征服沙患的创举。公社还大战二十天，劈开十座沙山，修成了二十一里长的第二干渠和组织群众挖井。这些工程都已发挥效益，在1959年夏秋无雨严重干旱的情况下，给庄稼普遍浇了两次水，保证了大丰收。
              繁荣
    三雷公社的人民，在向风沙作斗争中，取得了辉煌的成就。人民公社，带给他们向风沙进攻的力量。使他们可以命令风沙退却了！
    三雷公社地区的人民在1952年提出的“风不成灾，沙不南移，戈壁变绿洲，沙漠变良田”的长远奋斗目标，在人民公社成立的第一年，开始变成了生活的真实。村旁培植起许多花果园，大片黄蒿围定了一堆堆的沙丘，一条八十里长的绿色长城自东而西屹立在沙防前线，林外黄沙大漠里的林场培育的苗圃生机旺盛，这是人们准备1960年更大规模的改造沙漠的前哨阵地。跃进渠第一段工程已经完工，渠里行驶着木船，第二干渠已全部通水，将全社十万亩耕地变成水地。和兄弟公社联合修起的红崖山沙漠水库，已储水一亿一千万立方。三雷公社地区再也不是“一阵大风沙满天，百姓千年哭断肠”，而是“粮棉连年大增产，沙村硬要赶江南”了！
    三雷公社建社第一年，获得了粮棉大丰收。1959年粮食亩产量四百零一斤，比1958年增加了16％，棉花总产六十二万四千多斤，比1958年增长84．5％。社办林场开展林、副综合经营，总收入达一百零五万元，相当于合作化后四年总和的85％。随着生产的发展，社员收入1959年比1958年平均增长30％。解放前，逃亡只剩下九户的薛百村，现在，是一个有四百多户人家的欢乐的大村子了，全村85％的人家，过着相当于富裕中农的生活。1958年秋天，北方九省（区）绿化沙漠现场会议的代表，来这里参观时留下了这样的赞语：“来到薛百村，人人笑吟吟，好花观不完，好果尝不尽，沙漠穿绿衣，荒滩变园林，生产大发展，生活似蜜甜”。
    人民公社化的一年，是三雷人民向风沙大进攻、大胜利的一年。腾格里的暴躁性格依然没有改变，还时常掀起黑风和红风。但是，它在人们的心目中再不是什么神物了，而是可以驯服的“黄龙”。人，在沙漠面前越战越勇。他们现在正朝着“防护林带育桑蚕，沙漠尽成葡萄园，果木品种甲天下，高产金榜列粮棉”的目标，大踏步地前进。
