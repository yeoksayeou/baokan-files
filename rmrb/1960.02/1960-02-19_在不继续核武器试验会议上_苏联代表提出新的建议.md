At the Conference on the Discontinuance of Nuclear Weapon Tests
    Soviet Representative Proposes New Proposals

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 17th -- According to TASS, the Soviet representative, Tsarapkin, entrusted by the Soviet government, put forward new and important proposals on February 16 at the Soviet-American-British conference on the discontinuance of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests.

The purpose of this proposal is to solve the difficulties created by the US delegation for the meeting. The US delegation proposed on February 11 to resume nuclear weapon tests. The new Soviet proposal can also resolve the differences on standards (objective indicators of monitoring station instruments), which are the basis for sending investigation teams to the site to investigate suspected underground nuclear explosions.

In November and December last year, the Soviet-American-British tripartite scientific experts' meeting in Geneva unanimously adopted recommendations on possible improvements in instruments and techniques for detecting underground nuclear explosions. However, because the United States wanted to increase the number of inspection teams, the meeting failed to reach agreement on the standards that should serve as the basis for dispatching investigation teams.

Some groups in the United States, obsessed with continuing the nuclear arms race, are trying to use the failure to reach agreement on standards to create new difficulties for the meeting. The US delegation demanded negotiations on concluding a limited agreement permitting certain types of nuclear tests underground and in outer space. It is quite obvious that if this US proposal is accepted, the nuclear arms race will intensify.

In order to eliminate the obstacles set by the United States on the road to talks, Tsarapkin announced that the Soviet Union is prepared to agree that: in the initial stage of the supervisory body's work, for about two or three years, within the agreed annual limit (of the number of investigations to be conducted) and according to relatively simple standards, investigation teams will be sent to places where there are suspected nuclear explosions. The Soviet Union believes that such a standard could be to determine an area, that is, according to the materials of several monitoring stations, as recommended by the 1958 Geneva Experts' Meeting, to determine the location of the phenomenon within a maximum of two hundred square kilometers. In coastal areas, where it is more difficult to accurately determine the location of such a phenomenon, the area can be specified as larger. The Soviet Union suggests that only limited phenomena with obvious seismic characteristics should not be investigated.

The new Soviet proposal also stipulates that during the two to three year period in which the simplified standards proposed by the Soviet Union are adopted, the supervisory committee can formulate and determine a complete set of stricter standards that can correctly distinguish between underground nuclear explosions and natural seismic phenomena.

As long as the United States and Britain are sincere, the Soviet proposal (in the initial stage of the supervisory committee's work, inspection teams should be dispatched according to the simplified standards on which Soviet and American scientists have no differences) can enable a rapid consensus to be reached on the few remaining clauses of the treaty on the cessation of all nuclear weapon tests, and the treaty to be signed.

### 在不继续核武器试验会议上  苏联代表提出新的建议

    在不继续核武器试验会议上
    苏联代表提出新的建议
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：苏联代表查拉普金受苏联政府的委托16日在苏美英三国不继续原子武器和氢武器试验会议上提出了新的重要建议。
    这个建议目的在于解决美国代表团给会议造成的困难。美国代表团在2月11日的会议上提出了规定恢复核武器试验的建议。苏联的新建议还能解决标准（监督岗仪器的客观指标）问题上的分歧，这些标准是派遣调查组去现场侦查有地下核爆炸嫌疑的现象的根据。
    去年11月和12月在日内瓦举行的苏美英三国科学专家会议一致通过了关于可能改善发现地下核爆炸的仪器和技术方法的建议。但是，由于美国想增加检查组的数目，以致会议没有能就本应作为派遣调查组的根据的标准问题达成协议。
    美国某些醉心于继续核军备竞赛的集团，企图利用没有就标准问题达成协议这一点来给会议制造新的困难。美国代表团要求就缔结准许在地下和外层空间进行某些类型的核试验的有限协议进行谈判。十分明显，如果接受美国这个建议就会更加紧核军备竞赛。
    为了排除美国在会谈道路上所设下的障碍，查拉普金宣布，苏联准备同意：在监督机构工作的初期，大约两三年的时间内，在商定的每年（进行调查的次数的）限额的范围内和根据比较简单的标准，派遣调查组到有核爆炸嫌疑现象的地方进行调查。苏联认为，这种标准可以是确定地区，即根据1958年日内瓦专家会议的建议，按照若干监督岗的材料在最高达到二百平方公里的范围内确定出现现象的地点。在海洋沿岸地方，准确地确定有这种现象的地点比较困难，确定地区的面积可以规定得大些。苏联建议认为，只有具有明显地震特性的局限性现象不在调查之列。
    苏联新建议还规定，采用苏联所建议的简化标准的两三年期间内，监督委员会就可以制订和确定出一整套更加严格的能够正确分别地下核爆炸和自然地震现象的标准来。
    只要美英两国具有诚意，苏联的建议（在监督委员会工作的初期，应根据苏美科学家对之没有分歧的简化了的标准来派遣检查组）可以使得就停止一切核武器试验的条约的所余为数不多的条款迅速取得一致意见，并签订条约。
