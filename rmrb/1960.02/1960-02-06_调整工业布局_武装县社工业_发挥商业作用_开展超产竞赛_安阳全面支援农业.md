According to a report in the Henan Daily, Anyang City in Henan Province, while earnestly implementing the policy of "developing the national economy must be based on agriculture" and "combining the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture," has formulated a plan to comprehensively support agricultural technological transformation. The core content of this plan is: adjusting the layout of related industries to make industrial development better suited to agricultural needs; actively arming county and commune industries; and leveraging the role of commerce in supporting agriculture.  Industry, agriculture, and commerce are unified under the goal of realizing agricultural modernization and advancing together. Currently, workers and staff in various factories and enterprises are working hard to realize the "Plan for Comprehensive Support of Agricultural Technological Transformation."

In order to better serve agriculture, the industrial departments of Anyang City first conducted a series of political and ideological education activities for the broad masses of workers and staff. They launched discussions among the workers and staff on issues such as "Why should industry support agriculture?" and "Can industry develop faster without rapid agricultural development?" At the same time, they also summarized the achievements and experiences of Anyang City in the past few years in which industry and agriculture have supported each other and advanced together. Through discussions and summarizing experiences, the broad masses of workers and staff realized that 70% of the city's industrial raw materials come from rural areas, and more than 80% of industrial products are sold in rural areas, and that only by accelerating agricultural technological transformation can industry develop faster. Subsequently, the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee led a group of cadres to go deep into the countryside to conduct investigation and research. Through investigation and research, the Municipal Party Committee believes that, at present, industrial support for agricultural technological transformation must first mobilize workers and staff to engage in a large-scale overproduction movement to manufacture more means of production for agriculture; second, vigorously arming county and commune industries should be regarded as a basic measure to accelerate agricultural technological transformation and gradually realize national industrialization; and third, full attention should also be paid to the role of commerce in industrial support for agriculture. The city's plan for comprehensive support of agricultural technological transformation was formulated under the above guiding ideology. According to the plan, this year the city will manufacture a large number of power equipment, tillage machinery, harvesting and threshing machinery, irrigation and drainage machinery, agricultural product processing machinery, and mechanical equipment for arming county and commune industries according to the needs of agricultural production; and first arm 30 mechanical repair factories in 26 communes in the suburbs (including Anyang County) with 900 machine tools and hundreds of power equipment to undertake general manufacturing and all-round repair and assembly tasks.

Currently, Anyang City is vigorously organizing the implementation of the comprehensive plan for industrial support of agriculture in the following four aspects: 1. By adjusting the industrial layout, further strengthen industries that directly serve agriculture. The technical transformation of old enterprises has been strengthened so that they can manufacture more and better means of production for agriculture. A number of specialized machinery factories have been fixed and expanded. For example, the original machinery factories were respectively transformed into agricultural tillage machinery factories, agricultural power machinery factories, and pesticide machinery factories, and the original tinplate factory has now been transformed into a water conservancy irrigation and drainage machinery factory. New pesticide factories, transportation equipment factories, rubber factories, bearing factories, and fertilizer factories have been built. After the adjustment, a complete system for manufacturing agricultural machinery has basically been formed. 2. Organize workers and staff in all factories throughout the city to fully launch an overproduction movement of industrial support for agriculture, tap the potential of enterprises, improve production capacity, and realize the plan through self-reliance without increasing workers, increasing state investment, or asking the state for machines or raw materials. In order to solve the problem of raw materials, the Municipal Party Committee simultaneously focused on the overproduction of raw materials industries such as iron and steel; and simultaneously focused on the comprehensive utilization of various raw materials and economized materials. Recently, through a series of innovations, the daily output of pig iron has increased from 180 tons to more than 250 tons. In the past month, the mechanical industry's workers and staff have created and reformed more than 300 machines, turning many manual operations into mechanization and automation, and the city's mechanical manufacturing capacity has been greatly improved. Other industries have also vigorously carried out technical innovation and deeply tapped production potential, enthusiastically launching an overproduction movement to directly and indirectly support agriculture. 3. Organize relevant factories to create and improve new products that are more suitable from tillage, sowing, pest control, harvesting, processing, irrigation and drainage, transportation, power, and fertilizer aspects. There are 24 kinds of products being tested and put into production, such as organic disc harrows, all-purpose weeders, multi-purpose seeders, and cotton seeders. At the same time, according to the current urgent need of county and commune industries to improve mechanical repair and manufacturing capabilities and improve the comprehensive utilization and processing production capacity of agricultural products, organize relevant factories to rush to manufacture mechanical equipment to arm county and commune industries in terms of casting, forging, machine tool power, etc. Thirteen types of products, such as lathes, planers, and drilling machines, and more than 30 sets of power equipment have been successfully trial-produced and put into production. 4. Give full play to the role of commercial departments, assist large industries in completing the planning tasks of supporting agricultural technological transformation, organize and support small industries to manufacture small machinery and small farm tools to meet the diverse needs of agriculture at present.

In addition, the city has also widely launched mass activities in which each factory must do a few good things to promote agricultural development. Now many factories are directly linked to rural people's communes, and some large factories are also linked to some counties.

    调整工业布局  武装县社工业  发挥商业作用  开展超产竞赛
    安阳全面支援农业
    据河南日报消息　河南省安阳市在认真贯彻执行“发展国民经济必须以农业为基础”，以及“优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业相结合”的方针时，制定出全面支援农业技术改造的规划。这个规划的中心内容是：调整有关工业的布局，使工业的发展更加适应农业的需要；积极武装县、社工业；发挥商业在支援农业中的作用。把工、农、商统一组织在实现农业现代化的目标下，共同跃进。目前，各工厂企业职工，正在为实现“全面支援农业技术改造的规划”而努力。
    安阳市工业部门为了更好地为农业服务，他们首先向广大职工进行了一系列的政治思想教育工作。并就“工业为什么要支援农业”，“不迅速发展农业，工业能不能更快地发展”等问题，发动广大职工进行讨论。同时，还总结了安阳市几年来工业和农业互相支援、共同跃进的成就与经验。通过讨论、总结经验，使广大职工认识到全市有70％的工业原料来自农村，有80％多的工业产品销售在农村，只有加速农业技术改造，工业才能更快地发展。接着由市委书记带领一批干部，深入农村进行调查研究工作。通过调查研究，市委认为，目前工业支援农业技术改造，首先必须发动职工大搞超产运动，为农业制造更多的生产资料；其次要把大力武装县、社工业，作为加速农业技术改造和逐步实现国家工业化的一项基本措施。第三，还要充分注意商业在工业支援农业中的作用。这个市的全面支援农业技术改造的规划，就是在上述指导思想下制定出来的。按照规划，全市今年根据农业生产需要将大量制造动力设备、耕作机械、收割打谷机械、排灌机械、农产品加工机械和武装县、社工业用的机械设备；并首先以九百台机床和数百台动力设备，把市郊（包括安阳县）的二十六个公社的三十个机械修理厂武装起来，担负起一般制造和全能修配任务。
    目前安阳市正在从以下四方面大力组织实现工业支援农业的全面规划：一、通过调整工业布局，进一步加强直接为农业服务的工业。加强了对老企业的技术改造，以便能够为农业制造出更多更好的生产资料。固定和扩建了一批专业机械厂。如原来的机械厂分别改成了农业耕作机械厂、农业动力机械厂、农药机械厂，原来的白铁厂现在改成了水利排灌机械厂。并新建了农药厂、交通工具厂、橡胶厂、轴承厂和化肥厂等。经过调整基本上形成了一个制造农业机械的完整体系。二、组织全市所有工厂的职工，全面地开展了工业支援农业的超产运动，大挖企业潜力，提高生产能力，在不增加工人、不增加国家投资、不向国家要机器要原料的原则下，自力更生，实现规划。为了解决原料材料问题，市委一手大抓钢铁等原料材料工业的超产；一手大抓各种原料材料的综合利用，节约材料。最近通过一系列的革新，生铁日产量由一百八十吨提高到二百五十多吨。机械工业职工，最近一个月来创造、改革了三百多台机器，把许多手工操作变成了机械化和自动化，全市的机械制造能力得到了很大提高。其它工业也都大搞技术革新，深挖生产潜力，热烈地掀起了直接和间接地支援农业的超产运动。三、组织有关工厂从耕作、播种、杀虫、收打、加工、排灌、运输、动力、肥料等方面，创造改良更加适用的新产品。正在试制和已经投入生产的产品有机引耙、万能耘锄、多用播种机、棉花播种机等二十四种。同时按照目前县、社工业急需提高机械修配、制造能力和提高农产品综合利用加工生产能力的情况，组织有关工厂从铸造、锻压、机床动力等方面赶制武装县、社工业的机械设备。已经试制成功并投入生产的产品有车床、刨床、钻床等十三种和三十多套动力设备。四、充分发挥商业部门的作用，协助大工业完成支援农业技术改造的规划任务，组织和扶植小工业制造小型机械和小件农具，以满足目前农业多方面的需要。
    此外，这个市还广泛地开展了每个工厂都要为促进农业发展办几件好事的群众活动。现在许多工厂都直接和农村人民公社挂钩联系，有些大工厂还和一些县挂了钩。
