    Summing up last year's experience, vigorously grasping field management, and striving for high yields everywhere, Yanshi County takes measures to promote early regreening of wheat; Xiangcheng County strengthens leadership to eliminate low-yield wheat fields.
    This newspaper reports that after victoriously passing the overwintering stage of wheat, the people of Yanshi County, Henan Province, are making persistent efforts and preparing for the regreening of wheat in advance to promote early regreening and ensure a greater harvest this year.
    Yanshi County's overwintering of wheat this year was carried out under the guiding ideology of deeply summarizing the wheat yield increase experience of previous years, focusing on "three preventions" (preventing lodging, preventing pests and diseases, and preventing yellow and thin seedlings) and "four guarantees" (guaranteeing effective tillering, guaranteeing strong seedling fertilizer, guaranteeing short basal internodes, and guaranteeing well-rooted roots). As a result, the county's wheat field management work was carried out more meticulously than in any previous year. The county's 460,000 mu of wheat fields have been irrigated twice with winter water, topdressed twice, and cultivated and weeded more than 360,000 mu. More than 300,000 mu of high-yield fields in the county have been universally compacted to improve wheat seedling development. According to inspections, the average single plant has three to five tillers, with an average of about 800,000 plants per mu, and roots are about 130 cm deep. In many places where wheat field management has been done well, the wheat seedlings grow evenly and strongly due to the application of fertilizer at designated points and the rational combination of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers.
    In view of the fact that this county's "regreening stage" was grasped relatively late last year, resulting in rapid elongation of the stem after regreening and lodging during the seedling stage, which affected the normal growth of wheat, the Yanshi County Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately held a forum after basically passing the wheat overwintering stage to comprehensively analyze the wheat growth law and require a concentrated effort to attack the wheat regreening stage around the "Beginning of Spring." The County Committee also organized reporting groups to deeply publicize and conscientiously summarize the wheat yield increase experience of previous years from top to bottom, so that the broad masses could understand the benefits of early regreening of wheat. According to the masses' summary, these benefits are mainly: ① It can prolong the differentiation time of wheat ears, increase the growth period of spikelets, and promote more effective tillering. ② Early regreening can lengthen the distance between regreening and jointing, prolong the seedling stage, make the basal internodes of wheat short, the stems thick, and the stalks strong, and the resistance to lodging strong. ③ It can increase ground temperature, increase secondary roots, and make wheat roots strong and deep.
    In order to promote early regreening of wheat, all communes in the county have universally launched a red flag competition movement focused on making full preparations for wheat regreening in advance, ridge against ridge, slope against slope, beach against beach, and plain against plain. In terms of water conservancy construction, since the beginning of winter, the county has completed 61 small reservoirs, 2,086 canals, and 663 water wells, expanding the irrigated area by 110,000 mu. It is now vigorously engaged in field engineering to ensure that every plot can be irrigated and no plot is missed, so that irrigation projects are systematized. At the same time, communes and production teams have universally promoted methods such as high-temperature composting of fertilizer at the head of the fields and the establishment of livestock farms in the fields, and have launched a fertilizer accumulation and production movement. Now, in addition to preparing sufficient base fertilizer for spring crops, they have also prepared 33 billion jin of topdressing fertilizer for wheat regreening, most of which has been sent to the fields. In the past half month, thousands of skilled craftsmen in the county have rushed to manufacture and improve 1,150 various waterwheels, 3,290 carts, and more than 30,000 various tools. All communes have conscientiously arranged labor and made arrangements for short-term contracting during the wheat regreening period. Party organizations at all levels, such as communes and brigades, have designated special personnel to conscientiously strengthen leadership and conduct regular inspections to promote more meticulous preparation for wheat regreening.
    This newspaper reports that Xiangcheng County, Henan Province, in wheat field management, vigorously grasps the "three fields" (distant slope fields, hill fields, and late-sown fields), fundamentally eliminates the three types of seedlings, and promotes the upgrading of category two seedlings in every plot.
    Vigorously grasping the "three fields" was proposed by the Xiangcheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China after deeply summarizing the wheat yield increase experience of previous years and analyzing the reasons for the emergence of category two and three seedlings in the past. According to the inspection stations and teams, about 40% of the county's wheat and summer miscellaneous crops this year are planted in the "three fields." These remote and hill fields are far from the villages, and many of them have not been fertilized for many years in the past. Although base fertilizer was universally applied when wheat was planted last year, the foundation is still very thin; the late-sown fields were also cultivated relatively extensively due to late stubble removal. Therefore, the poorly growing category two and three seedlings are generally concentrated in these "three fields." According to the investigation, the wheat yield per mu of distant fields and nearby fields generally differs by 50 to 80 jin last year. In order to ensure a comprehensive and great wheat harvest this year and high yields in every plot, at the beginning of sowing, the Xiangcheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed eliminating category three seedlings before sowing and organized manpower and livestock to support the sowing work in distant slope fields, hill fields, and late-sown fields, so that the wheat sowing work in these lands was done better than in previous years. During winter field management, the County Committee vigorously proposed to treat the "three fields" generously and launched a "three fields" high-yield competition movement. In field management, the "three specialization" methods were generally adopted, such as special leadership by the Party Committee, organization of professional teams to strengthen management, and adoption of special measures according to local conditions. The County Committee and the Commune Party Committee have established "three fields" high-yield competition headquarters and are vigorously engaged in experimental fields. Cadres at all levels in the county have established more than 16,700 mu of "three fields" upgrading experimental fields. In the 50,000 mu of wheat high-yield fields directly led by the County Committee, Liu Ximin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the County Committee, personally participated and worked with the local commune and brigade Party secretaries to determine 260 mu of late-sown fields as experimental fields, conscientiously strengthen management, create experience, and promote the general, so that the wheat seedlings in all the hill fields, remote fields, and late-sown fields in this high-yield area are growing vigorously, and have generally caught up with or are close to the other wheat fields in the high-yield area. The 158 mu of "three fields" in Chahaiyan Brigade of Fanhu Commune, under the leadership of the "three fields" leap forward command station of the brigade Party branch, the entire team extracted 109 laborers to form a professional team to eliminate the "three fields," inspected plot by plot, studied plot by plot, formulated measures, and conscientiously strengthened management. Now, they have universally irrigated the frozen water and increased the application of quick-acting fertilizer.
    In carrying out the "three fields" high-yield competition, all localities have paid great attention to solving the problem of insufficient labor, and have mainly adopted the following three methods: First, accumulate and produce fertilizer on the spot in distant slope fields. In combination with winter field management, the county has built a total of 5,320 thatched ponds and 4,200 manure pits in the "three fields." Many toilets have also been built on water conservancy construction sites to accumulate human waste; and soil fertilizer plants have been universally consolidated and improved to produce a large amount of soil fertilizer. Second, change the transportation tools. A total of 4,800 manure carts and 4,100 carts have been modified, basically eliminating the phenomenon of carrying manure on shoulders. Third, organize collaborative support and large-scale operations. Communes and brigades with fewer hill fields and distant fields support communes and teams with more hill fields and distant fields, and cadres of county-level agencies and students of schools at all levels also participate in wheat field management during their spare time.
    The development of the "three fields" high-yield competition movement has powerfully promoted the county's wheat field management movement. The county's more than 710,000 mu of overwintering crops have been topdressed with an average of about 15,000 jin per mu, and 87% of the wheat fields have been irrigated with frozen water. Now, more than 80% of the wheat originally planted in the "three fields" in the county has caught up with the general fields in terms of growth status. Category two seedlings in the county have decreased from 22% at the beginning of the wheat field management movement to 16.2%, and category three seedlings have decreased from the original 7% to 1.8%. Many remote fields and hill fields that have never been fertilized in the past have now become high-yield areas with exceptionally vigorous wheat seedlings. Summer miscellaneous crops such as barley and peas, which have always been considered low-yield crops, were generally planted in remote fields, hill fields, and late-sown fields with extensive management in the past. This year, under the resounding slogan of vigorously grasping the "three fields," the field management has truly achieved "equal footing" for summer miscellaneous crops and wheat, and now they are growing vigorously.

    总结去年经验　狠抓田间管理　力争处处高产
    偃师县采取措施催小麦提早返青
    襄城县加强领导消灭小麦低产田
    本报讯　河南省偃师县人民在胜利度过了小麦越冬关以后，再接再厉，提前进行小麦返青准备，促使小麦早返青，保证今年更大丰收。
    偃师县今年的小麦越冬关是在深入总结历年的小麦增产经验，以“三防”（防倒伏、防病虫害、防黄瘦苗）、“四保”（保有效分蘖、保苗肥壮、保基节短、保扎好根）为主导思想下度过的，因而全县麦田管理工作进行得比过去任何一年都细致。全县四十六万亩小麦已普浇了两次冬水，施两次追肥，中耕除草三十六万多亩，全县三十多万亩丰产方普遍镇压了麦苗，发育良好。据检查，一般单株分蘖三至五个，每亩平均八十万株左右，根深一百三十厘米左右。在许多麦田管理工作搞得好的地方，由于在施肥上采取了点片施与合理搭配氮、磷、钾肥，麦苗长得均匀粗壮。
    鉴于这个县去年一部分麦田“返青关”抓的较晚，造成返青后拔节突长，一度产生苗期倒伏，影响小麦的正常生长，因而在基本度过了小麦越冬关以后，中共偃师县委立即召开了座谈会，全面分析小麦生长规律，要求在“立春”前后猛攻小麦返青关。县委还组织了报告团，深入宣传和自上而下地认真总结历年小麦增产经验，使广大群众都能认识小麦提前返青的好处。根据群众总结，这些好处主要是：①可以延长麦穗分化时间，增加小穗的生长期，促使有效分蘖多。②早返青可以拉长返青和拔节的距离，延长蹲苗时间，使小麦基节短、茎粗、秆硬，抗倒伏能力强。③可以提高地温，增加次生根系，使麦根粗壮，扎的深。
    为了促使小麦提前返青，目前全县各公社已普遍展开了岭对岭、坡对坡、滩对滩、平原对平原的以提前为小麦返青做好充分准备为中心的红旗竞赛运动。在水利建设方面，全县在入冬以来，已完成小型水库六十一座，水渠二千零八十六条，水井六百六十三眼，扩大水浇地十一万亩，现在正大搞田间工程，力争做到块块能浇，亩亩不漏，使灌溉工程系统化。同时各公社、生产队普遍推行了高温地头沤肥、田间建立畜牧场等方法，开展了积肥造肥运动，现在全县除为春播作物准备了充足的底肥外，并且为小麦返青准备了追肥三百三十亿斤，这些肥料大部送到地头。全县在最近半个月内，数千名能工巧匠共赶制和改良各种水车一千一百五十部，大车三千二百九十辆和各种工具三万多件。各公社都认真安排了劳力，并且作好了小麦返青期间的小段包工。公社、大队等各级党的组织都指定专人认真加强领导，定期进行检查，促使小麦返青的准备工作更加细致。
    本报讯　河南省襄城县在麦田管理中，狠抓“三田”（远坡田、山岗田和晚茬田），从根本上消灭三类苗，促使二类苗块块升级。
    大抓“三田”是中共襄城县委在深入总结了历年的小麦增产经验，分析了过去二、三类苗产生的原因以后提出来的。根据检查站队，今年这个县的小麦和夏杂作物约有40％是种在“三田”里。这些远地和山岗地，因离村较远，其中有不少地过去常年都不施肥料，去年种麦时，虽然普遍增施了底肥，但是底子还都很薄；晚茬田因腾茬晚，耕种也比较粗放。因而，生长不好的二、三类苗，一般都集中在这“三田”里。根据调查，去年远地和近地的小麦单产一般相差五十至八十斤。为了保证今年小麦全面大丰收，块块高产，播种开始时，中共襄城县委就提出了把三类苗消灭在播种前，并且组织人力、畜力支援远坡田、山岗田和晚茬田的播种工作，使这些土地的麦播工作做得比往年都好。在冬季的田间管理中，县委又响亮地提出了要厚待“三田”，展开了“三田”高产竞赛运动。在田间管理上，普遍采取了党委专人领导，组织专业队加强管理，因地制宜采取专门措施等“三专”办法。县委和公社党委都建立了“三田”高产竞赛指挥部，大搞试验田。全县各级干部共建立了“三田”升级试验田一万六千七百多亩。在县委直接领导的五万亩小麦丰产方里，县委书记处书记刘熙民亲自参加，和当地公社、大队党的书记一起，确定二百六十亩晚茬田为试验田，认真加强管理，创造经验，推动一般，使这个丰产方内的所有岗地、远地和晚茬地的麦苗都生长茁壮，一般都已赶上或接近丰产方里的其他麦田。范湖公社岔河沿大队的一百五十八亩“三田”，在大队党支部的“三田”跃进指挥站领导下，全队抽出一百零九名劳力，组成消灭“三田”专业队，逐块检查、逐块研究，制定措施，认真加强管理，现在已普遍浇过封冻水，还增施了速效肥料。
    在开展“三田”高产竞赛中，各地都十分注意解决劳力不足的问题，主要采取了以下三种办法：一是远坡田就地积肥造肥，全县结合冬季田间管理，共在“三田”里修建地头茅池五千三百二十个、沤粪坑四千二百多个。在水利工地上还修建了许多厕所，大积人粪尿；并且普遍整顿和健全了土化肥厂，大量制造土化肥。二是改变运输工具。共改制送粪推车四千八百多辆、大车四千一百辆，基本上消灭了在运粪中的肩挑现象。三是组织协作支援和大兵团作战。山岗地和远地少的公社和大队，支援山岗地和远地多的社、队，县直属机关干部及各级学校的学生也都利用业余时间参加麦田管理。
    “三田”高产竞赛运动的开展，有力地推动了全县的麦田管理运动。全县七十一万多亩越冬作物，每亩追肥平均在一万五千斤左右，87％的麦田都已浇过了封冻水。现在全县已经有80％以上的原来种植在“三田”里的小麦生长状况，都已赶上了一般田。全县二类苗已经由麦田管理运动初期的22％下降到16．2％，三类苗由原来的7％减少到1．8％。许多过去从来没有施过肥的远地和山岗地，今年都已经变成了麦苗异常茁壮的丰产方。一向被认为是低产作物的大麦和豌豆等夏杂作物，过去一般都种在远地、山岗地和晚茬地上，管理粗放，今年在狠抓“三田”的响亮口号下，在田间管理上真正做到了使夏杂作物和小麦“平起平坐”，现在块块生长得茁壮旺盛。
