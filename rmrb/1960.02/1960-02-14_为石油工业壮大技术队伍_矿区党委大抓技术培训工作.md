To Strengthen the Technical Ranks of the Petroleum Industry
    The Mining Area Party Committee Vigorously Promotes Technical Training Work

    (Our Urumqi dispatch) The Kelamayi Mining Area Party Committee focuses on both production and education, systematically using various forms to conduct technical training for employees. Since the start of oilfield construction in 1956, in just four short years, it has established a large technical team including geology, drilling, oil extraction, refining, and infrastructure, ensuring the needs of continuous production development.

    Currently, the Kelamayi Mining Area has initially formed a relatively complete educational system ranging from general technical education to higher education and scientific research. In addition to holding one to two general technical classes per week according to the needs of their work, all departments in the mining area have a professional technical school accommodating over a thousand people, seven secondary technical night schools, and three night universities. In the past year alone, fifteen short-term training courses in drilling, oil extraction, driving, and other specialties were conducted, and more than 350 people were selected from the workers for full-time advanced studies.

    The Mining Area Party Committee, in leading the technical training work, has made proper arrangements for teacher selection, textbook writing, and classroom equipment. It requires Party organizations at all levels to focus on both production and education, and to include employee education as an important item in the monthly deployment, inspection, evaluation, and summary work. In order to ensure study time, the Party Committee has adopted the measure of "unified arrangement, graded management." It stipulates that if classes are suspended for a week, it must be approved by the Mining Area Party Committee, and if classes are suspended for a day, it must be approved by the factory (office) Party Committee, so that employee education is institutionalized, regularized, and standardized, greatly improving the learning effect. Compared with 1956, the number of new workers in the entire mining area has increased nearly tenfold, but the average technical level of workers has increased from 2.3 to 3.5. In the past year alone, a large number of technical and management cadres have been promoted from the workers, many of whom are technicians and engineers. Comrade Ma Xueli, who was newly promoted to technician, herded cattle for landlords from a young age and had no opportunity to attend school. After liberation, he painstakingly studied culture and technology, and finally skillfully mastered oil extraction technology.

    In order to apply what is learned, closely integrate education with production practice, promote learning through production, and promote production through learning, Party organizations at all levels, while adhering to systematic technical education, vigorously grasp on-site training work. Many units have improved the previous form of apprenticeship contracts, which has achieved good results. In response to the characteristics of heavy tasks and weak forces, the First Drilling Division formulated on-site team-leading and class-leading apprenticeship contracts for the entire team and class. Each drilling team leads a learning drilling team, lecturing, working, and learning at the same time. Many new workers have generally become technically proficient all-rounders, and many people have reached the level of fourth-grade and fifth-grade workers. After the Oilfield Division conducted systematic oil extraction knowledge education for workers and vigorously grasped on-site training, 80% of the new workers were able to operate independently, and some of them also took up the work of foreman positions. When the "March 8th" Oil Extraction Team was established in the second half of 1958, only two second-grade workers were mentors, and all the other 102 people were family members of employees. Now they can manage more than 60 oil wells and 7 oil selection stations, overfulfilling the national plan every month. Last year, they were rated as an advanced collective in the mining area.

    In the process of running schools in various forms, Party organizations at all levels have also tried to set up some scientific research groups, absorbing veteran workers and technicians to participate in the research of major specialized problems. Two veteran workers in the Mechanical Factory's scientific research group researched and implemented thirty-six major innovation suggestions in half a year, which played a significant role in production.

    为石油工业壮大技术队伍
    矿区党委大抓技术培训工作
    本报乌鲁木齐电　克拉玛依矿区党委一手抓生产，一手抓教育，有计划、有系统地采用多种形式，对职工进行技术培训工作。自1956年开始建设油田以来，在短短四年中，已建立起一支包括地质、钻井、采油、炼油、基本建设等方面的庞大的技术队伍，保证了生产不断发展的需要。
    现在克拉玛依矿区已初步形成一个从普通技术教育到大专、科学研究的比较完整的教育体系。各部门根据本身工作的需要，每周按时上一次到二次普通技术课外，全矿区拥有一所容纳一千多人的专业技术学校，七个中等技术夜校，三个夜大学。仅去年一年，就先后举办了钻井、采油、司机等专业短期训练班十五期，并从工人中选拔了三百五十多人脱产深造。
    矿区党委在领导技术培训工作中，特别把教师选拔、教材编写、教室设备等作了妥善安排。要求各级党组织一手抓生产，一手抓教育，把职工教育列为每月布置、检查、评比、总结工作的重要项目。为了确保学习时间，党委采取了“统一安排，分级管理”的措施。规定：如停课一周，必须经矿区党委批准，停课一天，得由厂（处）党委批准，使职工教育制度化、经常化、正规化，大大提高了学习效果。1959年与1956年比较，全矿区新工人数增加了将近十倍，但是工人的平均技术等级却由以前的二点三级增长到三点五级。仅去年一年，就从工人中提拔了大批的技术、管理干部，其中不少人是技师、技术员，新被提拔作技师的马学礼同志，从小给地主放牛，没有机会上学。解放后苦心钻研文化、技术，终于熟练地掌握了采油技术。
    为了学以致用，使教育与生产实践密切结合，以生产带动学习，以学习促进生产，各级党组织在坚持与系统技术教育的同时，狠抓现场培训工作。许多单位把以前的师徒合同这个形式加以改进，收到了良好的效果。第一钻井处针对任务重、力量弱的特点，制订了现场队带队、班带班的整队整班的师徒合同。每一个处钻井队带一个学习钻井队，边讲、边作、边学。许多新工人普遍成为技术熟练的多面手，许多人已达到了四级、五级工水平。油田处在对工人进行系统采油知识教育的基础上，大抓现场培训工作以后，使新工人80％已能单独操作，其中一部分人还担任了领班岗位上的工作，“三八”采油队在1958年下半年成立时，只有两个二级工当师傅，其它一百零二人全是职工家属，现在她们却能管理六十多口油井，七个选油站，月月超额完成国家计划，去年被评为矿区先进集体。
    各级党组织在采用多种形式办学中，还试办了一些科学研究小组，吸收老工人和技术人员参加对重大的专门问题进行研究。机械厂科学研究组有两个老工人，半年中就研究实现了三十六项重大革新建议，对生产起了很大作用。
