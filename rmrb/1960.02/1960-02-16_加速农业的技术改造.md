    Accelerating the Technical Transformation of Agriculture
    Chen Zhengren
    I.
    The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have recently emphasized the instruction to accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture in our country. In order to build our country into a great, prosperous, and strong socialist nation with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science and culture, and modern national defense, we should strive to basically realize the modernization of agriculture in about ten years.
      Due to the realization of rural people's communes in 1958 on the basis of advanced agricultural cooperation in our country, socialist relations of production have been established on a foundation with a higher degree of public ownership. The people's commune, a social organizational form with strong vitality, has opened up broad avenues and created the necessary preconditions for accelerating socialist construction in our country, continuously developing agricultural productive forces, and accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture. The argument that agricultural collectivization could not be carried out without mechanization has been fully proven to be completely wrong by the great practice of more than 500 million farmers in China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong for the past decade. The victory of the socialist transformation of agriculture is a prerequisite for the comprehensive realization of the technical transformation of agriculture. Due to the consolidation and development of socialist relations of production, agricultural production has continued to surge, diversified economies are thriving, and the production of people's communes is continuously leaping forward, with rapid accumulation. The demand for labor is constantly increasing, and many people's communes are already preparing large amounts of funds and urgently requesting to purchase large quantities of agricultural machinery. Under the current circumstances, it has become extremely necessary for the state to rapidly develop the production of the agricultural machinery industry, meet the needs of agricultural technical transformation in a timely manner, vigorously support farmers, help people's communes solve the contradictions between production leaps and labor shortages, enable farmers to gradually reduce and get rid of heavy manual labor, and effectively improve agricultural labor productivity.
    Through ten years of construction in our country, especially the victories of the continuous Great Leap Forward in the past two years of 1958 and 1959, the foundation of socialist industrialization is constantly expanding. The development of the machinery industry has reached a considerable scale, and the agricultural machinery industry has also laid a certain foundation. We already have the world-class Luoyang Tractor Factory and Beijing Combine Harvester Factory. According to the current industrial level of the country, as long as we further adopt appropriate measures, it is entirely possible to gradually and continuously supply agriculture with new machines and new equipment.
    As mentioned above, it can be seen that we already have the social conditions and material conditions to accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture in our country. At the same time, it must also be seen that the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction has entered a new stage. In the comprehensive development of the entire national economy, agriculture is required to develop at a faster pace, adapting to the development of industry. To maintain a lasting mutual adaptation between industry and agriculture, it can only be achieved by gradually establishing both industry and agriculture on the same modern large-scale production technical basis. Making the industry and agriculture of our country gradually established on the technical basis of modern large-scale production to ensure the lasting and mutually adapting development of industry and agriculture is an extremely important basic condition for ensuring the sustained leap-forward development of socialist construction in our country. It is a new major content and material foundation for further consolidating and developing the worker-peasant alliance at this stage. This is also a fundamental issue in further implementing the general line of socialist construction. Contrary to the capitalist system, one of the great advantages of the socialist economy lies in its ability to continuously realize and maintain the mutual adaptation of industrial and agricultural development. From this, we can more clearly realize that the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong on accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture have extremely important and far-reaching significance both politically, economically, and theoretically.
    However, some comrades still have some different understandings of the great significance of accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture. Some comrades hold a one-sided understanding of the relationship between industry and agriculture, especially the principle of socialist industrialization and the priority development of heavy industry. They put industry and agriculture in opposition to each other, failing to understand that while industry is indeed the leading factor in the national economy, agriculture is the foundation for the development of the entire national economy. They believe that the realization of socialist industrialization can be separated from the modernization of socialist agriculture, and therefore do not adopt an active and serious attitude towards the technical transformation of agriculture.
    It should be affirmed that without giving priority to the development of heavy industry and without socialist industrialization, it is of course impossible to realize the modernization of agricultural production technology. This is the primary aspect of the matter. However, it must also be affirmed that without the modernization of agricultural production technology, it would be impossible to fully realize socialist industrialization, let alone talk about a high degree of industrialization. Marxism teaches us that to realize socialist industrialization, it is necessary not only to first solve the contradiction between socialist industry and the individual economy of agriculture, but also to solve the contradiction between technologically advanced industry and technologically backward agriculture in a timely manner. Technologically advanced industry and technologically backward agriculture cannot coexist for a long time, just as socialist industry and the individual economy of agriculture cannot coexist for a long time. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation": "If we cannot basically solve the problem of agricultural cooperation in about three five-year plans, that is, agriculture leaping from small-scale management using animal-powered farm tools to large-scale management using machines, including large-scale immigrant reclamation organized by the state using machines... , we will not be able to solve the contradiction between the need for annually increasing commodity grain and industrial raw materials and the generally low yields of major crops at present, our socialist industrialization cause will encounter great difficulties, and we will not be able to complete socialist industrialization." Due to the realization of agricultural cooperation, agricultural production in our country has presented a new situation of leap forward since 1956. By 1958 and 1959, with the realization of people's communes, a great situation of Great Leap Forward was formed and unfolded, and agricultural production achieved high-speed development. This high-speed development is something the capitalist world dares not dream of. Although the growth rate of agricultural products in our country is very fast, it still cannot fully meet the needs of industrial development and the ever-improving living standards of the people. Moreover, the contradiction of labor shortage is becoming increasingly prominent not only in industry but also in agriculture. The leap-forward development of industry itself also requires continuous expansion of the market, which also urgently requires agriculture to have a greater surge. All of these fully demonstrate that at present, on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, vigorously accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture according to the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture has become a major key to ensuring the sustained leap forward of socialist construction. Anyone who underestimates this aspect will make a major mistake. We should correct erroneous understandings and unify our thinking on this issue to ensure the accelerated realization of the technical transformation of agriculture.
    II.
    Implementing the technical transformation of agriculture and gradually modernizing agriculture is a basic task of socialist construction and also the most arduous and magnificent task of completing the technological revolution in our country. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his report at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party: "In terms of technological revolution, the main tasks are: to transfer the national economy, including agriculture and handicrafts, to a new technological basis in a planned and step-by-step manner, to a technological basis of modern large-scale production, to use machines for all labor that can use machines, and to realize the electrification of all cities and rural areas in the country... . While adopting the world's latest technological achievements as much as possible, we should widely carry out mass movements to improve tools and innovate technologies in cities and rural areas across the country, so that mechanical operation, semi-mechanical operation, and necessary manual labor are appropriately combined." According to this instruction, in terms of agriculture, it is necessary to implement the agricultural technological revolution, gradually realize agricultural mechanization and electrification, and even full automation. To achieve this goal, we must vigorously promote the mass movement of improving farm tools and innovating technologies, we must implement the policy of simultaneously developing mechanization and semi-mechanization, we must implement the policy of combining foreign and indigenous methods in production, and we should complete this huge historical task of agricultural modernization in a planned and step-by-step manner.
    Before 1959, agricultural mechanization in our country had already had some foundations in some areas, especially in state-owned agricultural reclamation undertakings. By 1959, the country had a total of 59,000 standard tractors. The total mechanical power in rural areas was about 6 million horsepower. The national area of mechanized farming has reached about 5% of the total cultivated area. According to the specific conditions of our country at present, we will roughly take the following steps in the future: strive to solve it on a small scale in about four years from 1959, solve it on a medium scale in about seven years, and solve it on a large scale in about ten years. Our overall goal is to gradually move towards comprehensive mechanization and electrification in all aspects of agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery production, water conservancy construction, farmland drainage and irrigation, fertilizer production, product processing, transportation, rural construction, etc., including the industrialization of people's communes in about ten years. However, in the first four years, due to insufficient conditions for agricultural machinery production, etc., we will focus on agriculture and animal husbandry, and first strive for the partial mechanization of agricultural and animal husbandry production and the basic mechanization of farmland drainage and irrigation. During these four years, the suburbs of large cities, commodity grain bases, major economic crop bases, and major animal husbandry bases should first achieve preliminary mechanization, while the majority of other areas across the country should mainly promote semi-mechanization and improved farm tools. Within seven years, as the agricultural machinery industry gradually increases and the supply of agricultural machinery will increase greatly, it will then be possible to mechanize more than half of the regions across the country. By about ten years, it will be possible to basically realize mechanization and a considerable degree of electrification nationwide. This is our general idea for realizing the modernization of agriculture in our country.
    Summarizing the existing experience of agricultural mechanization based on the characteristics of agriculture in our country, absorbing the advanced experience of the world, especially the Soviet Union and other socialist brother countries, and earnestly formulating a plan for realizing agricultural mechanization and electrification in our country is one of the current urgent tasks. Due to the diligence and wisdom of the vast number of laboring farmers, agriculture in our country has formed a good tradition of intensive cultivation with thousands of years of history. In the past, many high-yield events have occurred in paddy fields and water areas. Since liberation, especially since agricultural cooperation and communization, more than 500 million farmers, under the correct leadership of our Party, have brought into play their infinite wisdom and creative talents, making the good tradition of intensive cultivation over the past thousands of years systematically and comprehensively developed, creating numerous unprecedented high-yield records, and making agricultural production a new look. The Party and Comrade Mao Zedong attach great importance to these huge creations of the peasant masses, and timely and systematically summarize their rich experience, making it gradually form the "Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture." This is a major victory in the history of agricultural technology development and a victory with great scientific significance. When formulating plans and determining policies, we must first start from the implementation of the "Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture" and ensure the continued promotion of the good tradition of intensive cultivation. That is to say, when considering and adopting each mechanization measure, we should not only try our best to maximize the improvement of agricultural labor productivity, but also conduct sufficient scientific experiments and constantly create various precision machines suitable for intensive cultivation to ensure the continuous improvement of yield per unit area. This is an extremely arduous and complex task in the process of realizing agricultural mechanization in our country, and it is also a major task that must be solved and will certainly be solved. Secondly, our country has a vast territory, including from frigid zones to subtropical zones. The conditions of climate, topography, terrain, soil, water sources, etc., vary greatly, crops are very complex, and farming conditions are also diverse. These characteristics must be fully studied and earnestly noted. In addition, the rational utilization of the existing different energy and power resources in various parts of the country and the comprehensive utilization of agricultural machinery must also be fully considered and highly valued when formulating plans.
    In order to accelerate the realization of agricultural technical transformation, in the near future, agricultural machinery management departments at all levels, under the leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels, should concentrate the necessary forces, cooperate with all relevant departments, fully follow the mass line, and formulate a preliminary plan as soon as possible according to the Party's relevant guidelines and policies on agricultural mechanization and the existing experience in various places, according to the different characteristics, different conditions, and different needs of various places. On this basis, an implementation plan for the national agricultural modernization can be formulated in the near future.
    III.
    In order to ensure that agriculture can be equipped with a steady stream of new machines in the near future, it is necessary to build a system of agricultural machinery industry with a modern technical level in a planned manner in the next few years. This is another most urgent and practical arduous task at present, and it is also the necessary material guarantee for accelerating the realization of agricultural technical transformation. As early as during the First Five-Year Plan, the Party and the state had already begun to solve this task and had already achieved considerable success. Local agricultural tool manufacturing industries, especially the agricultural tool manufacturing and repair industries of communes, have sprung up rapidly since the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Although these manufacturing and repair industries are mostly manual production, they have become a new force for the further development of the agricultural machinery industry. In order to build a nationwide agricultural machinery industry system more quickly, our current task is, on the one hand, to first fully utilize the existing industrial base, gradually improve the equipment of existing enterprises in a planned manner according to needs and possibilities, and implement technical transformation; on the other hand, to vigorously accelerate the basic construction of new enterprises according to the national rational plan. At present, we are starting from both of these aspects at the same time, striving to build an agricultural machinery industry system.
    Since the service area of the agricultural machinery industry is the vast rural areas of the country, the products are numerous, and the regional adaptability is strong, this determines that the construction of the agricultural machinery industry must pay more attention to decentralization and breadth. According to this characteristic, the construction policy of the agricultural machinery industry should first emphasize the policy of simultaneously developing large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, with small and medium-sized enterprises as the mainstay. Does this mean that large enterprises are not important? Of course not. The dominant products in agricultural machinery are still large agricultural machinery, such as tractors, self-propelled chassis, agricultural vehicles, rural construction and water conservancy construction machinery, etc. In order to produce these large machines, it is absolutely necessary to build a number of large enterprises as the backbone nationwide. However, the largest number and the most types of agricultural machinery, from relatively simple technology to relatively complex and precise machinery, are still mostly small and medium-sized products. Some of these small and medium-sized products should also be produced by large enterprises, but more should be produced by small and medium-sized enterprises. In order to adapt to the different needs of different regions, to facilitate local material procurement, rational utilization of resources in various regions, and to facilitate production and sales and save transportation power, more small and medium-sized enterprises should be developed. It should also be seen that the development process of agricultural mechanization and electrification will also be the development process of commune industrialization, and the two are closely related. Adopting the policy of mainly small and medium-sized enterprises will greatly facilitate the development of commune industrialization, and will greatly facilitate the combination of industry and agriculture. In this way, it will inevitably be conducive to accelerating the speed of construction and consolidating the commune.
    Another policy related to the above policy is to resolutely implement the policy of simultaneously developing the central government and local governments. Under the premise of centralized unified planning by the central government and rational division of labor and cooperation among all regions across the country, the division of labor in enterprise construction should also focus on the local aspect. Of course, this does not mean that the central government does not need to directly strengthen the construction of agricultural machinery enterprises. On the contrary, in addition to strengthening unified planning and organizing regional division of labor and cooperation, the central government must also vigorously accelerate the construction of some key large-scale enterprises to drive and accelerate the comprehensive development of small and medium-sized enterprises in all regions across the country. However, the much larger number of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are also the most widely distributed, must rely on local governments, prefectures, counties, and people's communes to develop. In this way, it will be more conducive to carrying out construction in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, more conducive to making the design and production of products tailored to local conditions, and more able to bring into play the initiative of local governments. What is particularly important is that it is more conducive to directly mobilizing the high enthusiasm of more than 500 million farmers for the technical transformation of agriculture.
    Another policy in the construction of the agricultural machinery industry is the policy of combining foreign and indigenous methods, that is, the policy of simultaneously developing mechanization and semi-mechanization. The process of implementing this policy will also be the process of gradual development of agricultural mechanization and electrification from low to high and from old to new. In order to lay the foundation for the technical transformation of agriculture in our country and improve the technical level of agriculture as quickly as possible, we must do everything possible to accelerate the construction of a number of new enterprises with highly modern technology, adopt the world's most advanced technology as much as possible, and actively carry out technical transformation of existing enterprises. However, for the large number of small and medium-sized enterprises, especially the largest number of small enterprises, we should also fully utilize the old equipment conditions to increase production in a certain period of time, especially to increase the production of semi-mechanized farm tools and improved farm tools. If we deviate from the current actual possibilities, prematurely and excessively pursue new technologies, or underestimate the production of semi-mechanized and improved farm tools, it will cause major mistakes, which must be prevented.
    In the development of the agricultural machinery industry, we should pay attention to strengthening cooperation with other related industrial sectors, especially strengthening cooperation with other machinery industrial sectors, to ensure that the construction of the agricultural machinery industry and the construction of the entire machinery industry are mutually adapted and mutually promoted. Here, it is necessary to emphasize the principle of subordinating to the overall situation and starting from the overall interests of the entire national economy, in order to promote and accelerate the comprehensive development of socialist construction.
    IV.
    Planning and accelerating the development of agricultural machinery science and technology research work and cultivating a large number of scientific and technical personnel are important keys to accelerating the realization of agricultural technical transformation. Since liberation, agricultural machinery science and technology research work has achieved many achievements, and the scientific and technical team is constantly growing. However, the existing achievements are far from meeting the current actual needs. Now we must vigorously strengthen leadership, from top to bottom, from the central government to provinces, prefectures, counties, and communes, quickly establish and improve agricultural scientific research institutions, adopt the method of vigorously launching mass movements and achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results, with the whole country working together, and strive for a great leap forward in agricultural machinery scientific research work.
    In order to enable scientific research work to achieve more, faster, and better results, we must first further clarify the purpose of scientific research work and the purpose of agricultural machinery scientific research work, which is to serve the practice of agricultural technical transformation of our country's current socialism, and to serve the implementation of the Party's and the state's guidelines and policies for agricultural technical transformation. All of its activities must first proceed from the specific characteristics of agriculture in our country and the most urgent needs of more than 500 million farmers. Its task is to solve the problem of how to realize agricultural mechanization and electrification under the specific conditions of China. Our research work, in agriculture (including forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery), should take the "Eight-Character Constitution" as the guiding principle. That is to say, we must gradually and comprehensively solve the mechanization of "soil, fertilizer, water, seeds, density, protection, management, and engineering" in all aspects suitable for the characteristics of agriculture in our country. First of all, it is of course necessary to solve the problems of agricultural cultivation, water conservancy engineering, farmland drainage and irrigation, transportation, agricultural product processing, and other mechanization issues. To this end, agricultural machinery researchers must not only study the general theory of agricultural mechanization and electrification, but also seriously study and learn the Party's guidelines and policies, constantly emancipate their minds, devote themselves to the current mass movement of improving farm tools and technological innovation, and study and familiarize themselves with relevant information on the characteristics of Chinese agriculture, including information on natural conditions (including power and energy), the history of agricultural development, the history of farm tool development, agronomic characteristics, especially the good tradition of intensive cultivation, and so on. In order to truly understand and master the different agronomic characteristics of various parts of the country, scientific research workers also need to participate in production labor with farmers for a certain period of time. We must adhere to the method of combining theory with practice, and adhere to the principle of combining politics and technology, that is, we must adhere to the principle of combining the technical team with the mass movement under the leadership of the Party. We must prevent the tendency of research work to be divorced from reality and the masses. We must make all researchers truly understand the purpose of research work, closely link with reality, link with the masses, and use the current limited research forces in a planned and focused way in the most urgently needed and effective aspects, so as to concentrate forces, break through key points, and promote the overall situation.
    In order to meet the needs of agricultural technical transformation, a large number of scientific and technical personnel must be trained. According to preliminary estimates, about 200,000 senior technical personnel are needed in agricultural machinery in the next ten years, and the number of intermediate and junior technical personnel will be in the millions. Of course, it is not easy to quickly train so many technical cadres in a relatively short period of time. The whole Party must take action, adopt the method of more, faster, better, and more economical, simultaneously develop the central government and local governments, simultaneously develop specialized colleges and affiliated schools of institutions and enterprises, and simultaneously develop regular full-time schools and spare-time or part-time schools. We must also attach great importance to improving the cultural level of agricultural machinery workers, systematically carry out political and technical education for them, and train a large number of technical cadres among the workers in a planned manner, all the way to training a large number of engineers. School education and scientific research work must resolutely implement the principle of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor." Due to the heavy task and the urgent need, for the large-scale establishment of agricultural machinery schools (from primary to senior), all regions must not only have appropriate plans, but also take active measures in all aspects to strive for a great leap forward in scientific research work.
    V.
    Actively and massively launching a mass movement to improve farm tools, tools, and technological innovation in the vast rural areas is an extremely important task for implementing the agricultural technological revolution and is the main foundation for completing the agricultural technical transformation. The socialist agricultural technical transformation is a great cause of the people of the whole country. Such a great cause must rely on the conscious efforts of the broad masses of people, especially the broad masses of farmers, and rely on their infinite wisdom and continuous creation. Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in the article "The Victory of Marxism-Leninism in China": "Our socialist construction is the conscious cause of thousands of people. Without bringing into play the creativity of the people, there can be no vigorous socialist construction."
    On the basis of the basic completion of the socialist transformation of agriculture, the movement of improving farm tools and tools and innovating technology in rural areas began to develop vigorously from 1956. In particular, it has gained wider and faster development since the Great Leap Forward in 1958. According to existing materials, in 1958 and 1959, more than 100 kinds of major new-style farm tools were created and improved nationwide, and more than 210 million pieces of improved farm tools were promoted. In 1958 alone, due to the increase in labor required for the Great Leap Forward in production, agricultural production was short of 10 billion workdays. Due to the increased and improved work efficiency of improved farm tools, approximately half of the shortage of workdays was solved. Recently, due to the continuous Great Leap Forward in water conservancy construction, the "Eight-Character Constitution" continues to be promoted and developed, especially under the encouragement of the great call of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong to accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture, the broad masses of farmers and scientific workers have shown their soaring energy and creative talents for improving farm tools and tools and innovating technology. On the various water conservancy construction sites spread across the country, and in farming, transportation, livestock breeding, and even canteen cooking, many innovative and improved new-style farm tools and tools have emerged, greatly improving labor productivity and accelerating the speed of construction. Our current task is to guide the mass movement of improving farm tools, tools, and technological innovation to a new and higher stage, that is, to develop from the reform of individual farm tools and tools towards a comprehensive, serialized, and semi-mechanized direction, creating conditions for gradually realizing full mechanization.
    In order to achieve the above tasks, we must first strengthen the Party's leadership over this movement, especially the leadership in political ideology. Some people underestimate the creative power of the broad masses of farmers and underestimate the great role of the mass movement of improving farm tools, tools, and technological innovation. They do not understand that this is the main foundation for realizing the agricultural technical transformation, nor do they understand that this great practice and creation of the working masses is the fundamental source of scientific development. Universally raising the awareness of the mass movement within and outside the Party will greatly promote the development of this movement. Secondly, we should systematically summarize the experience in the movement and fully utilize the valuable achievements already obtained in the movement. For the new-style farm tools and tools that have been created or modified and have been proven to be successful through general testing, they should be scientifically evaluated, comprehensively ranked, and selected and finalized, and on this basis, they should be further improved and upgraded to gradually realize serialization. Again, it is necessary to improve the management institutions for farm tool improvement at all levels, and especially to attach importance to discovering advanced models of technological innovation in the movement. Like in factories, it is necessary to systematically train a large number of technical cadres among the farmers and strengthen the backbone team of the rural technical revolution. In terms of material, we must also strengthen support for the peasant masses. Agricultural machinery departments should give due attention to equipment and materials for trial-producing farm tools and tools, as well as all necessary technical support. Agricultural machinery departments at all levels must take the mass movement of more than 500 million farmers improving farm tools, tools, and technological innovation as a most basic task, and do all the work related to agricultural technical transformation well on this basis.
    We are full of great confidence in the great task of accelerating the realization of agricultural technical transformation. Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line, with the strong support of the state and the working class, relying on the efforts of the people's communes and more than 500 million farmers, adhering to putting politics in command and developing the mass movement on the agricultural machinery front, firmly grasping the banner of the Party's general line and Mao Zedong Thought, we will certainly be able to achieve the great victory of socialist agricultural technical transformation in the not-too-distant future.

    加速农业的技术改造
    陈正人
    一
    党中央和毛泽东同志最近强调地提出了加速我国农业技术改造的指示。为了把我国建设成为一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化和现代国防的伟大的富强的社会主义国家，我们应该争取在十年左右的时间内，基本上实现农业的现代化。
      由于我国农村在高级合作化的基础上，于1958年实现了农村人民公社化，社会主义的生产关系已经在公有化程度更高的基础上确立起来了。人民公社这个具有强大生命力的社会组织形式，为加速我国社会主义建设，不断发展农业的生产力，加速农业的技术改造，开辟了广阔的道路，创造了必要的前提条件。那种认为没有机械化就不能实行农业合作化的论调，已经被我国五亿多农民十年来在中国共产党和毛泽东同志领导下的伟大实践，充分证明是完全错误的。农业社会主义改造的胜利，是全面实现农业技术改造的先决条件。由于社会主义生产关系的巩固和发展，农业生产不断高涨，多种经济欣欣向荣，人民公社的生产不断跃进，积累迅速增多，对劳动力的需要不断增加，许多人民公社已经准备着大量的资金迫切要求购买大批的农业机器。在目前这种情况下，国家迅速地发展农业机械工业的生产，及时满足农业技术改造的需要，大力给农民以支援，帮助人民公社解决生产跃进和劳动力不足的矛盾，使农民逐步减轻和摆脱繁重的体力劳动，有效地提高农业劳动生产率，就成为十分必要的了。
    我国经过十年来的建设，特别是1958年和1959年两年来连续大跃进的胜利，社会主义工业化的基础，正在不断扩大。机械工业的发展已有了相当大的规模，农业机械工业也奠定了一定的基础，我们已经有了具有世界水平的洛阳拖拉机厂和北京联合收割机厂等。按照现在国家的工业水平，只要我们进一步采取恰当的措施，完全有可能逐步源源供给农业以新的机器、新的装备。
    如上所述，可以看出，我们已具有加速我国农业技术改造的社会条件和物质条件。同时，还必须看到，社会主义建设大跃进已经进入了一个新的阶段，在整个国民经济的全面发展中，要求农业以更快的步伐向前发展，与工业的发展相适应。要保持工业和农业持久的互相适应，只有逐渐使工业和农业都建立在同一的现代化大生产的技术基础上才能达到。使我国的工业和农业逐步地都建立在现代大生产的技术基础上，以保证工农业持久的互相适应的发展，这正是保证我国社会主义建设以跃进的速度持久发展的一个极为重要的基本条件，是现阶段继续巩固和发展工农联盟的一个新的主要内容和物质基础。这也是进一步贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线的一个根本性的问题。和资本主义制度相反，社会主义经济的巨大优越性之一，就在于能够不断地实现和保持工农业发展的互相适应。由此，我们可以更清楚地认识到，党中央和毛泽东同志关于加速农业技术改造的指示，无论在政治上、经济上、理论上都具有极为重大而深远的意义。
    但是，对于加速农业技术改造的巨大意义，有的同志还有一些不同的认识。有的同志对于工业和农业的相互关系，特别是对于社会主义工业化和优先发展重工业的原则，抱着片面的理解。他们把工业和农业互相对立起来，不了解工业固然是国民经济的主导，而农业却是整个国民经济发展的基础。他们以为，社会主义工业化的实现可以离开社会主义农业的现代化，因而对于农业技术改造不采取积极认真的态度。
    应该肯定，不优先发展重工业，没有社会主义的工业化，当然不可能实现农业生产技术的现代化。这是事情的首要方面。但是，还必须肯定另一个方面，那就是如果没有农业生产技术的现代化，也就不可能完全实现社会主义的工业化，更谈不到高度的工业化了。马克思主义教导我们，要实现社会主义工业化，不只是要首先解决社会主义的工业和个体经济的农业这个矛盾，也必须适时地解决先进技术的工业和落后技术的农业这个矛盾。先进技术的工业和落后技术的农业不可能长期并存，也正如社会主义的工业和个体经济的农业不能长期并存一样。毛泽东同志在“关于农业合作化问题”的报告中就曾经指出：“如果我们不能在大约三个五年计划的时期内基本上解决农业合作化的问题，即农业由使用畜力农具的小规模的经营跃进到使用机器的大规模的经营，包括由国家组织的使用机器的大规模的移民垦荒在内……，我们就不能解决年年增长的商品粮食和工业原料的需要同现时主要农作物一般产量很低之间的矛盾，我们的社会主义工业化事业就会遇到绝大的困难，我们就不可能完成社会主义工业化。”我国农业生产由于实现了农业合作化，从1956年起就出现了跃进的新局面，到1958年和1959年，随着人民公社化的实现，形成和展开了大跃进的大好形势，农业生产获得了高速度的发展。这种高速度的发展是资本主义世界所不敢梦想的。我国农产品增长速度尽管很快，但是，仍然不能完全满足工业发展和人民生活日益提高的需要。而且劳动力不足的矛盾，不仅在工业方面，就在农业方面也同样日益突出起来了。工业的跃进发展，本身也要求不断地扩大市场，这也迫切需要农业有更大的高涨。所有这些都充分说明，在目前，在优先发展重工业的基础上，按照工农业同时并举的方针，大力加速农业的技术改造，已经成为保证社会主义建设持久跃进的重大关键。谁要是对这一方面估计不足，谁就要犯重大错误。我们应该在这个问题上，纠正错误认识，统一思想，以保证加速实现农业的技术改造。

    实行农业的技术改造，使农业逐步现代化，这是社会主义建设的一个基本任务，也是完成我国技术革命的一个最艰巨最宏伟的任务。刘少奇同志在党的八大二次会议的报告中说：“在技术革命方面，主要的任务是：把包括农业和手工业在内的全国经济有计划有步骤地转到新的技术基础上，转到现代化大生产的技术基础上，使一切能够使用机器的劳动都使用机器，实现全国城市和农村的电气化……。在尽可能地采用世界上最新的技术成就的同时，在全国的城市和农村中广泛地开展改良工具和革新技术的群众运动，使机械操作、半机械操作和必要的手工劳动适当地结合起来。”根据这个指示，在农业方面，就是要实行农业的技术革命，逐步地实现农业机械化、电气化，以至全面自动化。为达此目的，必须大搞改良农具和改良工具的技术革新的群众运动，必须实行机械化和半机械化同时并举的方针，必须实行生产上洋土并举的方针，并且应该有计划有步骤地来完成农业现代化这个巨大的历史任务。
    我国的农业机械化，在1959年以前，在部分地区，特别是在国营农垦事业方面已经有了若干基础。到1959年，全国共拥有拖拉机五万九千标准台。农村现有的全部机械动力合计约为六百多万马力。全国的机耕面积，已经达到了总耕地面积的5％左右。按照我国现时的具体条件，我们今后将大体采取这样的步骤：从1959年起争取四年左右小解决，七年左右中解决，十年左右大解决。我们总的目标是要使农业、林业、牧业、副业和渔业各项生产、水利施工、农田排灌、造肥积肥、产品加工、交通运输、农村建筑等等，在十年左右的时间内逐步走向全面机械化和电气化，包括人民公社的工业化。但是，在头四年内，由于农业机械生产等等条件不足，着重以农业和牧业为重点，首先争取农、牧业生产小部机械化，和农田排灌基本机械化。在这四年内，要使大城市郊区、商品粮食基地、主要经济作物基地和主要牧业基地首先实现初步机械化，而在全国其他的大多数地区则以推行半机械化和改良农具为主。在七年内，由于农业机械工业逐渐增多，农业机器的供应将大量增加，那时就有可能使全国一半以上地区实现机械化。到了十年左右的时候，就有可能在全国范围内基本上实现机械化和相当程度的电气化了。这就是我们对于实现我国农业现代化的一个大致的设想。
    根据我国农业的特点总结已有的农业机械化的经验，吸收世界的首先是苏联及其他社会主义兄弟国家的先进经验，切实制订出实现我国农业机械化、电气化的规划，是当前的迫切任务之一。我国农业由于广大劳动农民的勤劳智慧，已经形成了有数千年历史的精耕细作的优良传统，在水田水地地区过去曾经出现过许多高产事迹。解放以来，尤其是农业合作化和公社化以来，五亿多农民在我们党的正确领导下，发挥了他们的无穷的智慧和创造才能，使得过去几千年来的精耕细作的优良传统得到了系统的全面的发展，创造了许许多多空前的高产纪录，使农业生产面貌为之一新。党和毛泽东同志极端重视农民群众的这些巨大创造，及时地系统地总结了他们的丰富经验，使之逐步形成为“农业八字宪法”。这是农业技术发展史上的重大胜利，是具有巨大科学意义的胜利。我们在制订规划、确定政策的时候，首先必须以贯彻“农业八字宪法”为出发点，必须以保证继续发扬精耕细作的优良传统为出发点。这就是说，在考虑和采取每一项机械化措施的时候，不仅要尽量做到最大限度地提高农业劳动生产率，而且要经过充分的科学试验，不断创制各种适应精耕细作的精密机具，以保证单位面积产量不断地提高。这是我国实现农业机械化过程中一项极为艰巨复杂的任务，也是必须解决而又一定能够解决的一项重大任务。其次，我国幅员广大，包括从寒带直到亚热带，气候、地形、地势、土壤、水源等等条件千差万异，农作物非常复杂，耕作条件也多种多样。对于这些特点，都必须充分研究和切实注意。此外，对于全国各地现有的不同能源、动力资源的合理利用以及农业机械的综合利用，在制订规划的时候，也必须充分考虑和高度重视。
    为了加速实现农业技术改造，在最近时期内，各级农业机械管理部门，在各级党委和政府的领导下，应该集中必要的力量，协同一切有关部门，充分走群众路线，根据党的有关农业机械化的方针政策和各地已有的经验，按照各地的不同特点、不同条件和不同需要，尽快地制订出一个初步的规划。在这基础上，不久的将来就可以制订出全国农业现代化的实施规划。
    三
    为了保证在不久的将来能够以源源不断的新式机器装备农业，必须在最近若干年内有计划地逐步建成一个具有现代技术水平的农业机械工业体系。这是当前另一个最迫切最实际的繁重任务，也是加速实现农业技术改造所必需的物质保证。还在第一个五年计划期间，党和国家就已经开始着手解决这个任务，而且已经取得了相当大的成就。地方的农具制造工业，特别是公社的农具制造修理工业，从1958年大跃进以来更如雨后春笋，发展迅速。这些制造修理工业虽然大都是手工生产，但已经成为农业机械工业进一步发展的一支新生力量。为了较迅速地建成一个全国性的农业机械工业体系，我们当前的任务，一方面是要首先充分利用现有的工业基础，根据需要和可能有计划地逐步改善现有企业的装备，实行技术改造；另一方面要根据全国的合理规划，大力加速新企业的基本建设。目前我们正从这两个方面同时着手，为建设一个农业机械工业体系而努力。
    由于农业机械工业的服务面是全国的广大农村，产品繁多，地区适应性强，这就决定了农业机械工业的建设必须注意更多的分散性和广泛性。根据这个特点，农业机械工业的建设方针，首先应该强调大型企业和中小型企业同时并举而以中小型企业为主的方针。这是不是说大型企业就不重要了呢？当然不是的。在农业机械方面占主导地位的产品首先还是大型农业机械，如拖拉机、自动底盘、农用汽车、农村建筑和水利施工机械等等。为了生产这些大型机械，在全国范围内建设一批大型企业作为骨干，当然是绝对必要的。但是农业机械中数量最大，种类最多，从技术比较简易的一直到比较复杂和精密的机械，还是以中、小型产品为多。这些中、小型产品，有的也应该由大型企业来生产，但更多的则应该由中、小型企业来生产。为了适应不同地区的不同需要，便于就地取材，合理利用各地资源，以及为了便利产销，节约运输力量，都应该更多地发展中、小型企业。还应该看到：农业机械化电气化的发展过程，也将是公社工业化的发展过程，两者是密切联系着的。采取以中、小型企业为主的方针，将大大有利于公社工业化的发展，并将大大便利于工业和农业的结合，这样，也就必然有利于加快建设的速度和公社的巩固。
    和上述方针相联系的另一方针，就是要坚决实行中央和地方同时并举的方针。在中央集中统一规划和全国各个地区合理分工协作的前提下，在企业建设的分工上，还应该着重以地方为主这一方面。这当然不是说，中央不需要直接加强农业机械企业的建设，相反，中央除了要加强统一规划和组织地区的分工协作以外，还必须大力加速一些关键性的大型企业的建设，以带动和加速全国各地区中、小型企业的全面发展。但是，数量多得多的，分布面也最广泛的中小型企业，则必须依靠地方、依靠专区、县和人民公社来发展。这样，才更有利于多快好省地进行建设，更有利于使产品的设计和生产实现因地制宜，也更能够发挥地方的主动性，特别重要的是更有利于直接调动五亿多农民对于农业技术改造的高度积极性。
    在农业机械工业建设上的又一个方针，是洋土并举的方针，也就是机械化和半机械化同时并举的方针。实行这个方针的过程，也将是农业机械化、电气化由低到高、由旧到新逐步发展的过程。为了奠定我国农业技术改造的基础，尽可能快地提高农业的技术水平，我们必须尽一切可能加速建设一批具有高度现代技术的新企业，尽可能地采用世界最先进的技术，并且对于现有企业积极地进行技术改造。但是对于数量众多的中、小型企业，特别是数量最多的小型企业，在一定时期内，我们还应该充分地利用旧有的设备条件来增加生产，尤其是增加半机械化农具和改良农具的生产。如果脱离当前实际的可能，过早地和过高地追求新技术，或者轻视半机械化和改良农具的生产，将会造成重大错误，必须加以预防。
    在农业机械工业发展中，应该注意加强和其他有关工业部门的协作，特别是要加强和其他机械工业部门的协作，保证农业机械工业的建设和整个机械工业的建设互相适应和互相促进。在这里，必须强调服从全局，从整个国民经济发展的整体利益出发的原则，以利促进和加速社会主义建设的全面发展。
    四
    有计划地加速开展农业机械科学技术研究工作，大量地培养科学技术队伍，是加速实现农业技术改造的重要关键。解放以来，农业机械科学技术研究工作已经获得了许多成就，科学技术队伍正在不断壮大。但是，已有的成就，还远远不能满足当前的实际需要。现在必须大力加强领导，从上到下，从中央到省、专区、县、公社，都迅速建立和健全农业科学研究机构，采取大搞群众运动和多快好省的办法，全国上下一齐动手，争取农业机械科学研究工作来一个大跃进。
    为了使科学研究工作能够取得更多更快更好的成效，首先必须进一步明确科学研究工作的目的、农业机械科学研究工作的目的，在于为我国当前社会主义的农业技术改造的实践服务，为贯彻党和国家的农业技术改造的方针政策服务。它的全部活动，必须首先从我国农业的具体特点和五亿多农民当前最迫切的需要出发。它的任务是要解决在中国的具体条件下如何实现农业机械化、电气化的问题。我们的研究工作，在农业方面（包括林、牧、副、渔等方面），应该以“八字宪法”为纲。这就是说，要逐步地全面地解决适合我国农业特点的“土、肥、水、种、密、保、管、工”各个方面的机械化的问题。首先当然是要解决农业耕作，水利工程，农田排灌，交通运输，农产品加工等机械化的问题。为此，农业机械研究人员，不仅要学习农业机械化电气化的一般理论，还必须认真地研究和学习党的方针政策，不断解放思想，投身于当前改良农具和技术革新的群众运动中去，研究和熟悉中国农业特点的有关资料，这里包括自然条件方面的资料（包括动力能源），农业发展的历史，农具发展史，农艺特点，特别是精耕细作的优良传统等等。为了真正通晓和掌握全国各地不同的农艺特点，科学研究工作者，还有必要和农民一道参加一定时间的生产劳动。我们必须坚持理论和实践相结合的方法，坚持政治、技术相结合的原则，也就是要坚持在党的领导下技术队伍和群众运动相结合的原则。必须防止研究工作中脱离实际、脱离群众的自流倾向，要使所有研究人员真正地了解研究工作的目的，密切联系实际，联系群众，要把现在有限的研究力量，有计划有重点地用在当前最急需最有效的方面，做到集中兵力，突破重点，推动全局。
    为了满足农业技术改造的需要，必须大量地培养科学技术人员。据初步估算，在最近十年内农业机械方面需要的高级技术人员大约二十万人左右，至于中级的和初级的技术人员，为数当以百万计。要在比较短促的时间内迅速培养出这样多的技术干部，当然是不容易的。必须全党动手，采取多、快、好、省的办法，实行中央和地方同时并举，专业院校和机关、企业附属学校同时并举，正规的全日制学校和业余的或半日制学校同时并举。还要十分重视提高农业机械职工的文化水平，系统地对他们进行政治的和技术的教育，有计划地在职工中间大量培养技术干部，一直到培养出大批的工程师。学校教育和科学研究工作，都必须坚决贯彻执行“教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合”的原则。由于任务繁重，需要紧迫，对于大办农业机械学校（由初级一直到高级），各地不仅要有恰当的规划，而且还必须从各方面采取积极的措施，争取和科学研究工作一样，也来一个大跃进。
    五
    在广大农村中积极地大规模地开展改良农具、工具和技术革新运动，是实行农业技术革命的一项极为重要的任务，是完成农业技术改造的主要基础。社会主义的农业技术改造，是全国人民的伟大事业。这样一个伟大的事业，必须依靠广大群众特别是广大农民的自觉努力，依靠他们的无穷智慧和不断创造。刘少奇同志在“马克思列宁主义在中国的胜利”一文中，曾经指出：“我们的社会主义建设是千千万万人民群众的自觉的事业，不发挥人民群众的创造力，就不可能有生气勃勃的社会主义建设。”
    在农业社会主义改造基本完成的基础上，从1956年起，农村的农具、工具的改良和技术革新运动就开始蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来了，特别是从1958年大跃进以来，获得了更广泛更迅速的发展，根据现有材料，在1958年和1959年，全国创造和改良的主要新式农具有一百多种，推广了的改良农具达两亿一千万件以上。在1958年这一年，因生产大跃进所需的劳动力增多，农业生产缺工达一百亿个工日，由于改良农具所增加和提高的工效，大约解决了所缺工日的一半。最近，由于水利建设不断大跃进，
  “八字宪法”继续推行和发展，特别是在党和毛泽东同志关于加速农业技术改造这个伟大号召的鼓舞之下，广大农民和科学工作者更表现出了他们对于改良农具、工具的冲天干劲和创造才能。在布满全国的各个水利工地上，以及在耕作、交通运输、牲畜饲养一直到食堂炊事等方面，都不断出现了许多创制的和改良的新式农具和工具，大大地提高了劳动生产率，加快了建设速度。我们现在的任务，就是要把改良农具、工具和技术革新的群众运动，引导到一个新的更高的阶段，也就是由个别农具和工具的改革，向着全面的、系列化的半机械化的方向发展，为逐步实现全面机械化创造条件。
    为了实现上述任务，首先必须加强党对于这一运动的领导，特别是政治思想方面的领导。有一部分人对于广大农民的创造力量估计不足，对于改良农具、工具和技术革新的群众运动的巨大作用估计不足。他们不了解这是实现农业技术改造的主要基础，也不了解劳动群众的这种伟大实践和创造是科学发展的根本源泉。在党内外普遍提高对于群众运动的认识，就一定会大大促进这个运动的发展。其次，应该系统地总结运动中的经验，充分利用运动中已经获得的宝贵成果。对于现在已经创制或改制的，经过普遍试验证明确实成功的新式农具和工具，应该经过科学鉴定，全面排队，进行选型定型，并在这个基础上，进一步地改进和提高，使其逐步地实现系列化。再次，就是要健全各级农具改良的管理机构，尤其要重视在运动中发现技术革新的先进模范。和在工厂一样，要有计划地在农民群众中大量培养技术干部，壮大农村技术革命的骨干队伍。在物质方面也必须加强对农民群众的支援。如试制农具工具的设备和材料，以及一切必要的技术支援，农业机械部门都应该予以应有的重视。各级农业机械部门，必须把搞好五亿多农民改良农具工具、技术革新的群众运动，作为一个最基本的任务，并且要在这个基础上做好有关农业技术改造方面的全部工作。
    我们对于加速实现农业技术改造这个伟大任务，充满了高度的信心，在党中央和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，在国家和工人阶级的强大支援下，依靠人民公社和五亿多农民的努力，在农业机械战线上坚持政治挂帅和发展群众运动，牢牢地掌握党的总路线和毛泽东思想的旗帜，我们就一定能够在不很久的将来取得社会主义农业技术改造的伟大胜利。
