Comrades! Friends!

These days, the people of the Soviet Union and China, together with the people of all countries in the socialist camp, and all people who cherish the great and noble cause of peace and progress, are celebrating the glorious tenth anniversary of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

In the history of international relations, there have been many alliances between different countries, but the truly fraternal relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and among all socialist countries, are unparalleled in history. This relationship is built on the Leninist principles of proletarian internationalism, and is based on a common ideology and the common goal of striving for a happy future for all mankind - communism. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "This is a great alliance between two great socialist countries. We share the same destiny, breathe the same air with the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp."

The ten years since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance have been a period of the most extensive and smooth development of fraternal friendly relations between the two countries, and a period of the closest cooperation in political, economic and cultural fields.

The Soviet people, who were the first in human history to embark on the road of building a socialist society and built a socialist society, know from their own experience and understand how complex and arduous the tasks are that lay before the Chinese people when they stretched out their giant arms, ended the tyranny of feudal lords, imperialists and comprador capitalists in their own country, and embarked on the broad road illuminated by the never-ending glory of Marxism-Leninism.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, which creatively combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of its own country, the Chinese people have achieved great victories in building socialism in the past ten years. As pointed out in the press communiqué on the results of the implementation of the 1959 national economic plan, thanks to the people of the whole country adhering to the general line of socialist construction, adhering to the Great Leap Forward, and using the organizational form of people's communes in agriculture, and launching a vigorous mass movement to increase production and practice economy, the 1959 plan for developing the national economy has been overfulfilled, and the Second Five-Year Plan has been completed three years ahead of schedule.

All this is a guarantee for the Chinese people to achieve new great achievements and victories. But the greatest achievement is that the Communist Party has united 650 million people, inspired their enthusiasm, and aroused their will to win in the process of socialist construction, so that they can overcome obstacles that seem insurmountable.

The socialist construction of the People's Republic of China is close to the hearts of the Soviet people and is cherished by them, because the great victory of the People's Republic of China, just like the victory of every socialist country, constantly strengthens the power of the entire socialist system and makes the final victory of socialism over capitalism come sooner.

We, the Soviet people, are pleased to see that some contributions from the Soviet Union and all countries in the socialist camp are included in the historic achievements of the Chinese people. What makes us all happy is that the industrial enterprises built in China with the participation of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are already playing an important role in the cause of industrialization and further economic development of the great brotherly country. The Sino-Soviet economic cooperation, which is reflected in the substantial increase in the volume of exchange of goods, is expanding day by day, the scientific and technological cooperation is developing day by day, and the cultural exchanges between the people of the two countries are becoming more and more extensive.

Long ago, Russia and China had already started friendly exchanges through caravans. Now everyone can see that the friendship and cooperation between the people of our two countries has developed so deeply and strongly that, in the words of the Chinese people, it is higher than the mountains and deeper than the sea.

Comrade Khrushchev pointed out in his speech in Beijing: "The Chinese people can be assured that the Soviet people will continue to be reliable and loyal friends of the Chinese people in the future, and will continue to vigorously help and support the Chinese people in the struggle to further consolidate and develop the People's Republic of China."

While celebrating the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, we are in such a historical environment: our two countries and other countries in the socialist camp have entered a new and decisive stage of peaceful competition with capitalism.

The Soviet people are celebrating the tenth anniversary of the signing of the treaty with a selfless struggle to realize the magnificent program of comprehensively unfolding communist construction. Last year, 1959, was the first year of the Seven-Year Plan, in which the Soviet Union achieved new historic achievements in developing industry, agriculture, science, culture, national education and health, and in improving the welfare of the Soviet people.

The first year of the Seven-Year Plan has passed. Arithmetic shows that there are six years left, but the arithmetic of the Soviet Communists should revise this algorithm. According to our calculations, the Soviet state does not need six years, but only five years, or even less than five years, to reach the height set by the Seven-Year Plan. The people and the Party are more united than ever before.

The Soviet people believe that their hard work for the happiness of the motherland, and their personal and collective heroism in daily work, is also fulfilling their international obligations - strengthening the economic strength of each country and the entire socialist camp, thereby consolidating world peace.

Every provision of the Sino-Soviet Treaty is filled with the spirit of further developing the friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China in order to consolidate peace. Working together and making concerted efforts to strive for peace - this is the most prominent feature of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union, China and all countries in the socialist camp.

The People's Republic of China has consistently actively supported all measures taken by the Soviet Union and the people's democracies to safeguard peace and the security of all countries. The Soviet Union has always regarded supporting the People's Republic of China's just struggle to restore its rights on the international stage as its international obligation.

The Soviet Union, together with other peace-loving countries, condemns all conspiracies to create two Chinas, which are aimed at separating Taiwan, a part of China's territory, from its homeland and being permanently occupied by the United States. There is only one China, and its capital is Beijing.

The big family of socialist countries is the most loyal and reliable friend of the Asian and African peoples who are fighting for national independence and striving to develop their national economy and culture. The People's Republic of China pursues a peaceful foreign policy and is one of the most active initiators and organizers of the Bandung Conference. The People's Republic of China is peace-loving, and this has been demonstrated again in the recently signed Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression.

As everyone knows, the recently signed US-Japan treaty does not conform to the interests of the Japanese people, and the spearhead of this treaty is directed at the peace-loving people of socialist countries. Under these conditions, the joint efforts made by China and the Soviet Union to consolidate peace in the Far East in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance are of greater significance.

The fraternal alliance between the Soviet Union and China is the unshakable foundation of the unbreakable unity of the big family of socialist countries. The world socialist system, which currently includes more than one billion people, is consolidating day by day, its strength is growing, and it is making its ranks more closely united. Consolidating world peace and ensuring peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems is the general line of the foreign policy of the socialist camp. Therefore, it is of great significance to unite all forces that advocate peace and to make every country contribute to this great, humanitarian, and noble cause.

All progressive mankind attaches great importance to the firm and peaceful foreign policy implemented by the Soviet Union, the Central Committee of the CPSU, and Ni. Se. Khrushchev personally, as well as the practical steps taken to achieve complete and thorough disarmament, because these steps are decisive conditions for ensuring peaceful coexistence and practical guarantees for world peace and security. These steps have already produced their own effect and have undoubtedly eased international tensions. The climate in international life has begun to warm up somewhat. The Consultative Conference of the Warsaw Treaty member states with the participation of China, North Korea, Vietnam and Mongolia, held in Moscow not long ago, also discussed these exciting and extremely important issues. The declaration of this conference confirmed the unwavering determination of the socialist countries to do everything possible to continue to ease international tensions and safeguard world peace.

Our achievements and results are indeed great. But we must not forget for a minute that there are still forces in the world that want to wage war and engage in an arms race. This requires the countries of the socialist camp, and all people in the world who cherish peace and happiness of all countries, to be vigilant, to oppose any conspiracy of imperialism, to expose the conspiracies of war instigators, and to strengthen the unity and friendship of the people of all countries - the foundation and guarantee of peace.

As for the attempts of imperialist groups to provoke and undermine the unity and friendly relations between the Soviet Union and China, Comrade Mao Zedong said it well: "... these conspiracies will never succeed at any time. No force in the world can separate us. The friendship between the 800 million people of the Soviet Union and China is eternal and unbreakable."

On the significant occasion of the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Soviet people extend fraternal greetings to the great and talented Chinese people, and wish the Chinese people new victories and achievements on the lofty road of building socialism and in the struggle for lasting world peace under the leadership of their strong and long-tested Communist Party and its Chairman Mao Zedong.

Dear comrades and friends: Please allow me to propose on this significant day, to the unbreakable friendship between the great Soviet and Chinese peoples, cheers!

To the health of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and the government of the People's Republic of China, cheers!

To the health of all Chinese comrades present, cheers!

To the health of all the guests present, cheers!

May the strong unity and close solidarity of the people of all countries in the socialist camp last forever!

Long live world peace!

### 苏联驻华大使契尔沃年科同志的讲话

    苏联驻华大使契尔沃年科同志的讲话亲爱的同志们！朋友们！
    这几天，苏中两国人民同社会主义阵营所有国家的人民，同一切珍视和平和进步的伟大崇高事业的人们一起，在庆祝苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和中华人民共和国的友好同盟互助条约光荣的十周年。
    在国际关系史中，有着不同国家的许许多多的同盟，但是，苏联和中华人民共和国之间，以及社会主义各国之间真正兄弟般的关系是历史中无可比拟的。这种关系是建筑在列宁的无产阶级国际主义原则上的，这种关系的基础是共同的意识形态和为争取全人类幸福的未来——共产主义而斗争的共同的目标。毛泽东同志说过：“这是两个伟大社会主义国家的伟大同盟。我们同苏联和整个社会主义阵营共命运，同呼吸。”
    苏中友好同盟互助条约签订后所经历的十年，是两个国家之间兄弟友好关系最广泛的和顺利的发展的时期，是在政治、经济和文化方面进行最密切合作的时期。
    在人类历史上第一个走上建设社会主义社会道路并建成社会主义社会的苏联人民，从亲身的经验中知道并且懂得，当中国人民舒展开巨人般的臂膀，结束了封建主、帝国主义者和买办资本在本国的横霸势力，走上了为马克思列宁主义永不熄灭的光辉所照亮着的康庄大道以后，摆在他们面前的任务是多么复杂和艰巨。
    中国人民在创造性地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同本国具体实践相结合的中国共产党的领导下，在过去的十年中，在建设社会主义方面取得了伟大的胜利。正如在关于1959年国民经济计划执行结果的新闻公报中所指出的，由于全国人民坚持社会主义建设总路线，坚持大跃进，并运用了农业中的组织形式——人民公社，展开了轰轰烈烈的增产节约的群众运动，1959年发展国民经济的计划已经超额完成，提前三年完成了第二个五年计划。
    所有这一切都是中国人民取得新的伟大成果和胜利的保证。但最伟大的成果是，共产党在社会主义建设过程中团结了六亿五千万人民，鼓舞了他们的热情，激发了他们取得胜利的意志，以致能够克服看来难以克服的障碍。
    中华人民共和国的社会主义建设对苏联人民来说是亲切的，是他们所珍视的，因为中华人民共和国的伟大胜利，也正如每一个社会主义国家的胜利一样，不断加强整个社会主义体系的威力，使社会主义对资本主义的最后胜利早日到来。
    我们苏联人民愉快地看到，在中国人民的具有历史意义的成果中有着苏联和社会主义阵营所有国家的某些贡献。使我们大家高兴的是，在苏联和其他社会主义国家的参加下在中国兴建的工业企业，已经在伟大的兄弟国家的工业化和进一步发展经济的事业中起着重要的作用。表现为换货量大大增长的苏中经济合作日益扩大，科学技术合作日益发展，两国人民间的文化交流日益广泛。
    在很早以前，俄国和中国已经通过商队开始了友好往来，现在大家都看到，我们两国人民的友谊和合作，已经发展得这样深厚和强大，用中国人民的话来说，真是比山还高，比海还深。
    赫鲁晓夫同志曾在北京发表演说时指出：“中国人民可以深信，苏联人民在今后仍将是中国人民可靠的忠实的朋友，在进一步巩固和发展中华人民共和国的斗争中仍将大力帮助和支援中国人民。”
    在庆祝苏中条约签订十周年的时候，我们正处在这样的历史环境中：我们两国和社会主义阵营其他各国一道进入了同资本主义和平竞赛的新的决定性的阶段。
    苏联人民正在用实现全面展开共产主义建设的宏伟纲领的忘我斗争来庆祝条约签订十周年这个有意义的日子。去年，1959年，是七年计划的第一年，在这一年里，苏联在发展工业、农业、科学、文化、国民教育和卫生事业方面，在增进苏联人民的福利方面取得了新的历史性的成就。
    七年计划的第一年已经过去了。算术表明，还剩下六年，但是苏联共产党人的算术要修改这种算法。根据我们的计算，苏维埃国家不需要六年，而只需要五年，甚至不需要五年，就能达到七年计划所拟定的高度。人民和党比过去任何时候都更加团结一致。
    苏联人民认为，他们为了祖国的幸福而紧张地劳动，他们个人和集体在日常劳动中表现出英雄主义精神，也就是履行自己的国际义务——加强每一个国家以及整个社会主义阵营的经济实力，从而巩固世界和平。
    苏中条约的每一项条文，都充满了进一步发展苏联和中华人民共和国的友好合作以巩固和平的精神。通力合作，双方一致努力，争取和平——这就是苏联、中国和社会主义阵营所有国家的外交政策最显著的特点。
    中华人民共和国过去和现在一贯积极地支持苏联和各人民民主国家为保障和平和各国人民的安全而采取的一切措施。苏联过去和现在始终都把支持中华人民共和国为恢复它在国际舞台上的权利而进行的正义斗争看做自己的国际义务。
    苏联同其他爱好和平的国家一起，谴责制造两个中国的一切阴谋，这种阴谋就是要使中国的一部分领土台湾脱离本国而永远被美国霸占。只有一个中国，它的首都是北京。
    社会主义国家的大家庭是正在进行民族独立斗争并努力发展民族经济和文化的亚非各国人民的最忠实最可靠的朋友。中华人民共和国在外交政策上奉行和平的方针，它是万隆会议最积极的发起者和组织者之一。中华人民共和国是爱好和平的，这一点在不久前签订的中缅友好和互不侵犯条约中再次表现了出来。
    大家知道，不久以前签订的美日条约不符合日本人民的利益，这一条约的矛头是指向社会主义国家的爱好和平的人民的。在这种条件下，中苏两国根据苏中友好同盟互助条约在巩固远东和平方面所作的共同努力就具有更大的意义。
    苏中两国的兄弟同盟是社会主义国家大家庭的牢不可破的团结一致的磐石般的基础。目前包括十亿多人民的世界社会主义体系在一天天巩固，它的力量越来越大，正在使自己的队伍更紧密地团结起来。巩固世界和平，保证不同社会制度的各国和平共处，是社会主义阵营各国外交政策的总路线。因此，团结一切主张和平的力量，使每一国家为这一伟大的、人道主义的、崇高的事业作出贡献，就具有巨大的意义。
    全体进步人类非常重视苏联、苏共中央以及尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫个人所执行的坚定不移的爱好和平的对外政策方针以及为实现全面彻底裁军而采取的实际步骤，因为这些步骤是保证和平共处和实际保障世界和平与安全的具有决定意义的条件。这些步骤已经产生了自己的效果，无疑地已经使国际紧张局势有了缓和。在国际生活中气候已经开始有些转暖。不久以前在莫斯科举行的有中朝越蒙参加的华沙条约缔约国协商会议也讨论了这些激动人心的极重要问题。这次会议的宣言证实了社会主义各国有不可动摇的决心，要竭尽一切力量继续缓和国际紧张局势，保障世界和平。
    我们的成就和成果的确是伟大的。但是我们一分钟也不应当忘记，世界上还存在着想进行战争和军备竞争的势力。这就要求社会主义阵营各国、要求全世界所有珍视各国人民的和平和幸福的人们保持警惕，必须反对帝国主义的任何阴谋，必须揭露战争挑拨者的阴谋诡计，加强各国人民的团结和友谊——和平的基础和保证。
    至于谈到帝国主义集团挑拨并破坏苏中两国的团结一致和友好关系的企图，毛泽东同志说得很对：“……这些阴谋在任何时候都是不会得逞的。世界上没有任何力量能够把我们分开。苏中八亿人民的友谊是永恒的、牢不可破的”。
    在苏中条约签订十周年这个有意义的日子里，苏联人民向伟大的天才的中国人民致以兄弟般的敬礼，并祝中国人民在自己强大的久经考验的共产党及其主席毛泽东同志的领导下在建设社会主义的崇高道路上，在争取世界持久和平的斗争中，取得新的胜利和成就。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们：请允许我在这个有意义的日子里提议，为伟大的苏中两国人民的牢不可破的友谊干杯。
    为以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府领导人的健康干杯！
    为在座的全体中国同志干杯！
    为在座的所有客人干杯！
    祝社会主义阵营各国人民坚强的一致和紧密的团结万古长青！
    世界和平万岁！
