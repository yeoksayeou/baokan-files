Comrades! Friends!

These days, the people of the Soviet Union and China, together with the people of all countries in the socialist camp, and all people who cherish the great and noble cause of peace and progress, are celebrating the glorious tenth anniversary of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

In the history of international relations, there have been many alliances between different countries, but the truly fraternal relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and among all socialist countries, are unparalleled in history. This relationship is built on the Leninist principles of proletarian internationalism, and is based on a common ideology and the common goal of striving for a happy future for all mankind - communism. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "This is a great alliance between two great socialist countries. We share the same destiny, breathe the same air with the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp."

The ten years since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance have been a period of the most extensive and smooth development of fraternal friendly relations between the two countries, and a period of the closest cooperation in political, economic and cultural fields.

The Soviet people, who were the first in human history to embark on the road of building a socialist society and built a socialist society, know from their own experience and understand how complex and arduous the tasks are that lay before the Chinese people when they stretched out their giant arms, ended the tyranny of feudal lords, imperialists and comprador capitalists in their own country, and embarked on the broad road illuminated by the never-ending glory of Marxism-Leninism.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, which creatively combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of its own country, the Chinese people have achieved great victories in building socialism in the past ten years. As pointed out in the press communiqu√© on the results of the implementation of the 1959 national economic plan, thanks to the people of the whole country adhering to the general line of socialist construction, adhering to the Great Leap Forward, and using the organizational form of people's communes in agriculture, and launching a vigorous mass movement to increase production and practice economy, the 1959 plan for developing the national economy has been overfulfilled, and the Second Five-Year Plan has been completed three years ahead of schedule.

All this is a guarantee for the Chinese people to achieve new great achievements and victories. But the greatest achievement is that the Communist Party has united 650 million people, inspired their enthusiasm, and aroused their will to win in the process of socialist construction, so that they can overcome obstacles that seem insurmountable.

The socialist construction of the People's Republic of China is close to the hearts of the Soviet people and is cherished by them, because the great victory of the People's Republic of China, just like the victory of every socialist country, constantly strengthens the power of the entire socialist system and makes the final victory of socialism over capitalism come sooner.

We, the Soviet people, are pleased to see that some contributions from the Soviet Union and all countries in the socialist camp are included in the historic achievements of the Chinese people. What makes us all happy is that the industrial enterprises built in China with the participation of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are already playing an important role in the cause of industrialization and further economic development of the great brotherly country. The Sino-Soviet economic cooperation, which is reflected in the substantial increase in the volume of exchange of goods, is expanding day by day, the scientific and technological cooperation is developing day by day, and the cultural exchanges between the people of the two countries are becoming more and more extensive.

Long ago, Russia and China had already started friendly exchanges through caravans. Now everyone can see that the friendship and cooperation between the people of our two countries has developed so deeply and strongly that, in the words of the Chinese people, it is higher than the mountains and deeper than the sea.

Comrade Khrushchev pointed out in his speech in Beijing: "The Chinese people can be assured that the Soviet people will continue to be reliable and loyal friends of the Chinese people in the future, and will continue to vigorously help and support the Chinese people in the struggle to further consolidate and develop the People's Republic of China."

While celebrating the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, we are in such a historical environment: our two countries and other countries in the socialist camp have entered a new and decisive stage of peaceful competition with capitalism.

The Soviet people are celebrating the tenth anniversary of the signing of the treaty with a selfless struggle to realize the magnificent program of comprehensively unfolding communist construction. Last year, 1959, was the first year of the Seven-Year Plan, in which the Soviet Union achieved new historic achievements in developing industry, agriculture, science, culture, national education and health, and in improving the welfare of the Soviet people.

The first year of the Seven-Year Plan has passed. Arithmetic shows that there are six years left, but the arithmetic of the Soviet Communists should revise this algorithm. According to our calculations, the Soviet state does not need six years, but only five years, or even less than five years, to reach the height set by the Seven-Year Plan. The people and the Party are more united than ever before.

The Soviet people believe that their hard work for the happiness of the motherland, and their personal and collective heroism in daily work, is also fulfilling their international obligations - strengthening the economic strength of each country and the entire socialist camp, thereby consolidating world peace.

Every provision of the Sino-Soviet Treaty is filled with the spirit of further developing the friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China in order to consolidate peace. Working together and making concerted efforts to strive for peace - this is the most prominent feature of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union, China and all countries in the socialist camp.

The People's Republic of China has consistently actively supported all measures taken by the Soviet Union and the people's democracies to safeguard peace and the security of all countries. The Soviet Union has always regarded supporting the People's Republic of China's just struggle to restore its rights on the international stage as its international obligation.

The Soviet Union, together with other peace-loving countries, condemns all conspiracies to create two Chinas, which are aimed at separating Taiwan, a part of China's territory, from its homeland and being permanently occupied by the United States. There is only one China, and its capital is Beijing.

The big family of socialist countries is the most loyal and reliable friend of the Asian and African peoples who are fighting for national independence and striving to develop their national economy and culture. The People's Republic of China pursues a peaceful foreign policy and is one of the most active initiators and organizers of the Bandung Conference. The People's Republic of China is peace-loving, and this has been demonstrated again in the recently signed Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression.

As everyone knows, the recently signed US-Japan treaty does not conform to the interests of the Japanese people, and the spearhead of this treaty is directed at the peace-loving people of socialist countries. Under these conditions, the joint efforts made by China and the Soviet Union to consolidate peace in the Far East in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance are of greater significance.

The fraternal alliance between the Soviet Union and China is the unshakable foundation of the unbreakable unity of the big family of socialist countries. The world socialist system, which currently includes more than one billion people, is consolidating day by day, its strength is growing, and it is making its ranks more closely united. Consolidating world peace and ensuring peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems is the general line of the foreign policy of the socialist camp. Therefore, it is of great significance to unite all forces that advocate peace and to make every country contribute to this great, humanitarian, and noble cause.

All progressive mankind attaches great importance to the firm and peaceful foreign policy implemented by the Soviet Union, the Central Committee of the CPSU, and Ni. Se. Khrushchev personally, as well as the practical steps taken to achieve complete and thorough disarmament, because these steps are decisive conditions for ensuring peaceful coexistence and practical guarantees for world peace and security. These steps have already produced their own effect and have undoubtedly eased international tensions. The climate in international life has begun to warm up somewhat. The Consultative Conference of the Warsaw Treaty member states with the participation of China, North Korea, Vietnam and Mongolia, held in Moscow not long ago, also discussed these exciting and extremely important issues. The declaration of this conference confirmed the unwavering determination of the socialist countries to do everything possible to continue to ease international tensions and safeguard world peace.

Our achievements and results are indeed great. But we must not forget for a minute that there are still forces in the world that want to wage war and engage in an arms race. This requires the countries of the socialist camp, and all people in the world who cherish peace and happiness of all countries, to be vigilant, to oppose any conspiracy of imperialism, to expose the conspiracies of war instigators, and to strengthen the unity and friendship of the people of all countries - the foundation and guarantee of peace.

As for the attempts of imperialist groups to provoke and undermine the unity and friendly relations between the Soviet Union and China, Comrade Mao Zedong said it well: "... these conspiracies will never succeed at any time. No force in the world can separate us. The friendship between the 800 million people of the Soviet Union and China is eternal and unbreakable."

On the significant occasion of the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Soviet people extend fraternal greetings to the great and talented Chinese people, and wish the Chinese people new victories and achievements on the lofty road of building socialism and in the struggle for lasting world peace under the leadership of their strong and long-tested Communist Party and its Chairman Mao Zedong.

Dear comrades and friends: Please allow me to propose on this significant day, to the unbreakable friendship between the great Soviet and Chinese peoples, cheers!

To the health of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and the government of the People's Republic of China, cheers!

To the health of all Chinese comrades present, cheers!

To the health of all the guests present, cheers!

May the strong unity and close solidarity of the people of all countries in the socialist camp last forever!

Long live world peace!
