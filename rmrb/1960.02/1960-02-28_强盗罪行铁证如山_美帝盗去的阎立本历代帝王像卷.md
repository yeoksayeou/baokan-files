    Ironclad Evidence of Robbery
    The Scroll of Emperors of Successive Dynasties by Yan Liben Stolen by American Imperialists

    Yan Liben was a great painter of the early Tang Dynasty. During the Zongzhang years, he held official positions such as "Right Chancellor" and "Director of the Secretariat." His father, Yan Pi, and elder brother, Yan Lide, were both famous painters, and his skills surpassed theirs.

    Yan Liben excelled at painting figure stories, Buddhist images, and saddle horses. In the Tang Dynasty, he was praised as "divine transformation in painting." His birth year is unknown, but he probably died during the Xianheng period (670-673).

    This scroll of emperor portraits, without a signature, is said to be his work. It depicts thirteen emperors, including "Emperor Guangwu of the Han, Liu Xiu," "Emperor Wen of Wei, Cao Pi," "Lord of Wu, Sun Quan," "Lord of Shu, Liu Bei," "Emperor Wu of Jin, Sima Yan," "Emperor Xuan of Chen, Xu," "Emperor Wen of Chen," "Emperor Fei of Chen, Bozong," "Last Emperor of Chen, Shubao," "Emperor Wen of Sui, Yang Jian," and "Emperor Yang of Sui, Yang Guang." He portrayed each individual with distinct personalities. This portrait of Cao Pi, Emperor Wen of Wei, (see picture) contains a profound and heroic spirit, but also a "literary air" of a poet. Liu Bei's face is full of wrinkles, with a hint of melancholy, which allows one to imagine his arduous life. Other figures, such as the frivolity of the Last Emperor of Chen and the insidiousness of Emperor Wen of Sui, are also depicted in great detail, closely resembling the characteristics of these figures as recorded in history. It is an amazing masterpiece. Its date goes back to the seventh century, making it an extremely precious cultural relic of our country passed down through generations. This emperor portrait was kept in the Lin family of Fujian during the late Qing Dynasty and later fell into the hands of Japanese imperialists. Finally, American imperialists plundered it and it is now in the "Boston Museum of Fine Arts."

    强盗罪行铁证如山
    美帝盗去的阎立本历代帝王像卷
    阎立本是唐代初期的一位大画家。在总章年间，做过“右相”“中书令”等官职。他父亲阎毗、哥哥阎立德，都是著名的画家，他的本领又超过了他们。
    阎立本擅长画人物故事，佛像、鞍马等，在唐代就被评为“丹青神化”，他的生年不可考，大约死在咸亨（670—673）年间。
    这幅帝王像卷，没有名款，相传是他的作品。一共画了十三个皇帝，有“光武帝刘秀”、“魏文帝曹丕”、“吴主孙权”、“蜀主刘备”、“晋武帝司马炎”、“陈宣帝顼”、“陈文帝”、“陈废帝伯宗”、“陈后主叔宝”、“隋文帝杨坚”、“炀帝杨广”等。他描写每一个人，都表现出不同的性格。这幅魏文帝曹丕像，（见图）含有深鸷雄杰的神态，但还有些诗人的“文气”。又像刘备的皱纹满面，略带忧郁之色，可以想像到他的艰苦一生。其他如陈后主的轻浮，隋文帝的阴险，也多能刻划入微，跟历史记载的这些人物的特性很相似。是一件惊人杰作。它的年代则远到七世纪，为我国传世的一件非常珍贵的文物。这幅帝王像，清末藏在福建林氏处，后来落入日本帝国主义者手中。最后，美帝国主义者又把它掠夺去，现存在“波士顿美术博物馆”里。
