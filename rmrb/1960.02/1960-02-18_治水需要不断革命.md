    Water Control Requires Continuous Revolution

    In the era of the small-scale peasant economy, people both loved and feared water, always hoping that one day they could conquer it and turn water disasters into water benefits. When people organized themselves and the small-scale peasant economy became a collective economy, people began to attack water with the strength of small collectives. Initially, they built small-scale water conservancy projects bit by bit, sporadically. As the degree of cooperation increased and the scale expanded, they gradually expanded the scope of water conservancy construction and the scale of projects. After the people's communes were established, the scale of water control became larger and larger.

    The transition from fearing water to controlling water is a great revolution against nature. To tame the raging floods, to eliminate the phenomenon of drought over thousands of miles, to ensure that crops are irrigated in a timely and appropriate manner, to guarantee stable agricultural production increases, and to fully utilize water energy to serve people's production and life is by no means an easy task. It requires arduous struggle and continuous revolution. The people of Yunxi County, Hubei Province, have best demonstrated the spirit of continuous revolution in their water control work. The most prominent example is Fu Zhengguo, a farmer in Yunxi County.

    Yunxi County is a place with crisscrossing mountains. In recent years, especially since the communization, the county has built a network of canals throughout the county in terms of water control, and has initially formed self-flowing irrigation. However, they were not satisfied with their existing achievements, but in the spirit of continuous revolution, on the basis of their existing achievements, they adopted the method of launching mass movements in a big way, and built a dragon-style hydropower processing system throughout the county, making rice milling, rice husking, flour grinding, cotton ginning, pestle ramming, oil pressing, sawing wood, paper making and many other tasks that originally relied on manual labor or manual operation, all replaced by hydropower processing tools. In this way, not only the labor intensity of people has been greatly reduced, but also the labor shortage has been greatly alleviated. Fu Zhengguo, a farmer in this county, successfully created a hydropower processing facility that automates flour grinding and rice milling after trial-producing a hydropower mill. Fu Zhengguo and the people of Yunxi County have been able to make continuous progress in water control work because they have the spirit of continuous revolution.

    At present, many regions across the country, like Yunxi County, have initially established self-flowing irrigation networks through large-scale water conservancy construction. Some regions are ahead of Yunxi County, and some regions have achieved relatively small results in water control. However, no matter what type of region, there is still much to be done in water control work. We should all, in the spirit of continuous revolution, not only seek grain from water, but also achieve multiple uses of water. There is a lot of work in water control. After completing one task, there are new tasks. After reaching one requirement, there are higher requirements. As long as we have the spirit of continuous revolution, we can make water control work better and better, more and more refined, and the power of people to control water will become greater and greater, and water will be able to better serve people's production and life.

    治水需要不断革命
    在小农经济时代，人们对水是又爱又怕，总希望有一天能够治服水，把水患变成水利。当人们组织起来、小农经济变成集体经济以后，人们就开始凭借着小集体的力量，向水开始了进攻。最初是一点一点地、零零星星地兴修一些小型水利，随着合作化程度的提高和规模的扩大，逐步扩大兴修水利的范围和工程的规模；人民公社化以后，治水的规模就愈来愈大了。
    人们从怕水到治水，是一场向自然的大革命。要把凶猛的洪水驯服，要消除赤地千里的干旱现象，要使农作物能够适时适量地有水灌溉，保证农业稳定增产，而且还要充分利用水能为人们的生产和生活服务，这决不是轻而易举的事情，必须经过艰苦的斗争、不断的革命。湖北郧西县的人民，正是在治水工作中坚持了不断革命精神，表现得最突出的是郧西县的农民傅正国。
    郧西县是个山岭纵横的地方。几年来，特别是公社化以来，这个县在治水方面建成了遍布全县的渠道网，初步地形成了自流灌溉。但是，他们没有满足于已有的成就，而是本着不断革命的精神，在已有成绩的基础上，采用大搞群众运动的方法，在全县范围内兴建起一条龙式的水力加工系统，使砻谷、碾米、磨面、轧花、打碓、榨油、锯木、造纸等等许多原来靠体力劳动或手工操作的活路，都用水力加工工具来代替。这样，不但大大减轻了人们的劳动强度，也大大缓和了劳力的紧张状况。这个县的农民傅正国在试制水力磨后，又成功地创造了使磨面、碾米全部自动化的水力加工设施。傅正国和郧西县的人民，所以能够在治水工作上不断前进，都是由于他们具有不断革命的精神。
    当前，全国已经有许多地区也像郧西县一样，通过大兴水利初步地建立了自流灌溉网，有的地区走在郧西县的前面，也有一些地区治水的成绩还比较小。但是，不管是哪类地区，治水工作都还大有可为，都应当本着不断革命的精神，不但向水要粮食，而且要做到一水多用。治水方面的工作很多，完成了一个任务，还有新的任务；达到了一个要求，还有更高的要求。只要具有不断革命的精神，就能使治水工作愈做愈好，愈做愈精，人控制水的力量也愈来愈大，水也就能够更好地为人民生产和生活服务。
