    The sun was setting, and the mountains were half dark and half bright. Meifeng, carrying a small basket, led her child Xiaojin along the mountain path back to her mother's house. She thought: I'll send a message back saying it's a birthday. But whose birthday it is, she didn't make clear. Father's? No; Mother's? Even less likely… Like stirring tofu with chopsticks, the more you stir, the more confused it gets. It's better to stop thinking about it and hurry on.
    As soon as the mother and son arrived at Peach Tree Flat, neighbors Qinglan and Qinghe ran out to greet them, and they all chatted and laughed as they entered the house. But to their surprise, there was no one inside. It was decorated as if for a festive occasion, with a picture of Chairman Mao in the center, surrounded by harvest scenes. The stools and mirrors were all scrubbed clean, and a new table had been added, with cakes and pastries on it. She put the basket on the table and asked, "Where are my parents? Where's my brother?" Qinglan smiled and said, "The old folks have gone to the canteen. As for your brother, he's up in the sky installing the Milky Way." Meifeng thought she was joking. Qinghe stepped forward and said softly, "You haven't been here for almost a year, so you're in the dark. The reclamation farm is helping us build a power station, and your brother went to install the lights. Today, we're generating electricity." When Meifeng heard this, she happily pulled Qinghe and Qinglan along to the power station.
    They went from the north of the village to the south, and along the way, many houses had been converted into small factories, and several new ones had been built. Meifeng was looking at the signs hanging at the entrances, such as rice mill, winery, ironworks, non-staple food factory… Qinghe said, "So many factories have been built in just one year, I can't even keep track of them all." As soon as they left the village, the field that Meifeng knew so well was right in front of them. She used to farm this field, "a knife in clear weather, a mess in rainy weather," yielding less than two hundred catties per mu in a year, but now it was planted with late rice, and it was growing so lushly that she couldn't help but ask, "Is this field yielding a lot of grain?" Qinghe said, "The early rice yielded four hundred catties." Meifeng said in surprise, "That's a really fast increase!" Qinglan immediately chimed in, "Our poor team has become a rich team, and the chicken coop has even produced a phoenix." As they spoke, they arrived at the power station. Her brother was assisting a comrade from the reclamation farm in the station. Hearing Meifeng's voice, he stood up from beside the machine, his body covered in oil, and said:
  "You're here, your parents are waiting for you in the canteen." Meifeng replied, "The electric lights are on, that's really fast!" Her brother was energized, wiped his hands, and said, "Hey, what are you saying? Since the establishment of the commune, what doesn't happen fast? With the help of the reclamation farm, it's even faster." He continued to work while saying, "I heard that they will soon help you block the water of the Dragon Pool to generate electricity."
    When the electric lights were tested and turned on, the people inside and outside the station were bustling and excited, talking about this and that. A primary school student even took out a book from his bag to read the words under the electric light. Xiaojin wanted his mother to hold him up to see the electric lights, and he happily swayed back and forth. Meifeng thought to herself, "It would be great to have this light for reading books and doing needlework!" Just as she was thinking this, her brother washed his hands, changed into a clean set of clothes, and they went to the canteen together. Meifeng was very interested in the power station and kept talking about it all the way, even forgetting to ask whose birthday it was.
    The canteen was bustling, and the villagers all came to greet Meifeng. Her mother put two bowls of food on the table and complained, "We've been waiting for you!"
    Everyone sat around the table, and Qinghe and Qinglan joined in the fun. Meifeng glanced around, and then glanced again, there were several dishes on the table. Her mother seemed to know what her daughter was thinking and said with a smile, "We're not what we used to be!" As soon as she said this, the old man couldn't sit still. He stood up and said to his daughter, "Since the establishment of the commune, our poor team has gradually become rich. Secretary Chen of the commune said that our team's foundation is weak, so to turn it around, he sent cadres to stay here and help with the work. Plus, we've allocated our own labor force well, and everyone is highly motivated. We can put in all our effort. Tell me, with production leaping forward, how can our lives not improve?" Meifeng said with a smile, "That's right." The old man continued to talk endlessly, "Not to mention anything else, just talking about raising pigs, everyone has more than two pigs." Then, he recited a lot of numbers. His wife interrupted him with a smile and said, "Okay, people don't need to eat, just listen to you talk!" Everyone laughed. The old man also smiled, sat down, pointed to the dishes on the table with his chopsticks and said, "Eat, eat, the commune is adding dishes today." Meifeng picked up a piece of meat for Xiaojin, and suddenly remembered the birthday, so she asked, "Dad, didn't you say it's someone's birthday today?" The old man laughed heartily and said, "Today is your mother's birthday." Her mother just smiled and said nothing. Meifeng asked again, "Whose birthday is it really?" The old man patted his chest and said, "It's mine." Qinglan interjected, "Guess, if you can't guess, you can't eat." Meifeng couldn't get an answer and pouted, saying, "Dad, you're so old and still joking!"
    At this moment, the electric lights suddenly came on. The Party Branch Secretary stood up and said, "Whose birthday is it today? It's everyone's birthday." Meifeng asked anxiously, "Whose?" The people at the table all said in unison, "The commune's." As soon as the words were spoken, the people in the canteen applauded loudly. Meifeng suddenly understood and smiled as she applauded along. Qinglan found an opportunity to say to her, "Eat quickly, after eating we're going to have a celebration party!"

    过生日
    朱惟豪
    太阳偏西了，山里一边暗，一边亮。梅凤挽个小篮子，领着孩子小金沿山腰小路回娘家去。她想：捎口信叫回去，说是过生日。是谁的生日，却没说清楚。爹的？不是；妈的？更不是……筷子搅豆腐，越搞越糊涂啦，爽性拉下不想，还得赶路呢。
    娘儿俩一到桃树坪，邻居青兰、青荷就跑出来迎着，几人说笑着进屋去了。可是出乎意料的是，屋里一个人也没有。布置得倒像个吉日，当中是毛主席像，四周是丰收图。凳子，镜子，都擦得干干净净，还添了一张新桌子，桌上还放些糕啦点啦什么的。她把篮子往桌上一放，就问：“咱爹娘呢？哥呢？”青兰一笑，说：“老爷子老奶奶到食堂去了。你哥么，人家上天装银河了呢。”梅凤信是开玩笑。青荷却上前轻声轻气地说：“你差不多一年没来，倒是坐在鼓里。垦殖场帮我们建电站，你哥装灯去了，今天发电呢。”梅凤听说，高兴的拉着青荷、青兰同到电站去。
    他们从村北到村南，一路上有不少房子改成小工厂，还盖了几幢新的。梅凤正看着门口挂的牌牌，什么碾米厂，酿酒厂，铁器厂，副食品厂……青荷就说：“一年就办了好多厂哪，我都说不清呢。”一出村，那一片梅凤熟悉的田就摆在眼跟前。她以前种过这田，“天晴一把刀，天雨一团糟”，一年亩产不到二百斤，可现在栽了晚禾，还长得这么茂盛，忍不住问：“这田打谷多吧？”青荷说：“早稻就打四百斤。”梅凤惊异地说：“增的真快呀！”青兰马上插嘴说：“我们穷队变富队，鸡群还出凤凰哩。”说着到了电站。她哥正在站里给垦殖场的一位同志当助手，听到梅凤的声音，就从机器旁站出个油光的身子，说：
  “来啦，爹妈在食堂等你。”梅凤边答应，边说：“就点上了电灯，真快哩！”哥哥兴起了一股劲，擦擦手说：“嗨，你说的，成立了公社，干什么不快？加上垦殖场的帮助，就更快。”他一边忙做事，一边又说：“我听说，他们不久还要帮你们堵住那龙潭的水发电。”
    电灯一试亮了，站里站外的人闹轰轰的，高兴得说这说那。有个小学生还特意从书包里掏出一本书来对着电灯光看看字。小金要妈妈抱起来看电灯，乐的晃来晃去。梅凤心里想：“要有这灯看书、做针线才好哩！”正想着，哥哥洗好了手，换过一身衣服，他们就一同到食堂去。梅凤对电站很感兴趣，一路上尽谈这个，连谁过生日都忘了问。
    食堂里闹轰轰的，村里人见梅凤来了，都来跟她招呼。她妈把手上两碗菜往桌上一放，埋怨着：“就等着你哩！”
    大家围坐一桌，青荷、青兰也跟着凑热乎。梅凤扫了一眼，又扫一眼，桌上摆了好几样菜。妈好像知道女儿的心思似的，笑着说：“我们可不比以前啦！”这么一说，老头就坐不住了，他站起来对女儿说：“一成立公社，我们这个穷队就慢慢富起来了。社里的陈书记说，我们队底子薄，要扭过来，就派干部长驻下来，帮助工作，加上我们自己劳动力调配得好，大家干劲高，多少力都能使出来，你说说，生产跃进了，生活那能不提高？”梅凤笑着说：“那是。”老头又滔滔不绝地说：“不说别的，就说养猪，每人摊上有二头多。”接着，他又背了好些数目字。老伴笑着打断他的话说：“好啦，人家不用吃，光听你讲吧！”大家一下都笑了起来。老头也一笑，坐下来拿筷子指着桌上的菜说：“吃吧，吃吧，今天社里加菜呢。”梅凤给小金夹了一块肉，忽然记起生日的事，就问：“爹，不是说今天是谁的生日么？”老头哈哈笑着说：“今天是你妈的生日。”妈直笑不说。梅凤又问：“到底是谁的生日？”老头拍拍胸，又说：“是我的。”青兰却插嘴说：“你猜吧，猜不出不让吃。”梅凤问不出，撅着嘴说：“爹，你佬这大年纪还开玩笑！”
    这时候，电灯一下子亮了。党支书站了起来说：“今天是哪一个人的生日？是我们大家的生日。”梅凤急着问：“谁的？”桌上的人这才异口同声地说：“社的。”话音刚落，食堂里的人哗哗地鼓起掌来，梅凤恍然大悟，也笑着跟着鼓起掌来。青兰瞅空对她说：“快吃吧，吃了还要开庆祝晚会哩！”
