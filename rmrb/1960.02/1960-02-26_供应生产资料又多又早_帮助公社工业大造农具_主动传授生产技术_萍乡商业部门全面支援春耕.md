Pingxiang Commercial Departments Fully Support Spring Plowing

Nanchang Dispatch from Our Newspaper, February 25th: The commercial departments of Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province, are vigorously organizing the supply of production materials for spring plowing, promoting rapid progress in the county's spring plowing work and becoming a red banner on the commercial front in Jiangxi Province in supporting spring agricultural production.

According to recent statistics, the county's commercial departments have already organized the supply of over 350,000 dan of local fertilizer to rural areas, averaging over 80 jin per mu of early rice paddy; over 690,000 jin of lime; over 12,000 sets of plowshares and plow bodies; over 73,000 pieces of hoes and rakes; and have added to and repaired over 400,000 pieces of various agricultural machinery and new-style agricultural tools. The quantity and variety have increased by about 30% compared to last year, powerfully promoting rural preparations for plowing. Utilizing the over 9,700 deep plows supplied by the commercial departments, the area of deep plowing and soil improvement in the communes this year in just over a month has exceeded the plan by 67%. Many commune members have reflected, "The supply of production materials is timely and good, making production very smooth. The work of the commercial departments is truly excellent."

Pingxiang County requires a greater leap forward in agricultural production this year than last year. The county demands that the supply of production materials for spring plowing be early, large in quantity, diverse in variety, and good in quality. Based on these characteristics, the Pingxiang commercial departments took the initiative as early as October of last year to organize over 1,000 staff members, through "upper, middle, and lower" channels, to understand the needs of the county in the supply of production materials for spring plowing this year. "Upper" means proactively consulting the county party committee to understand the committee's requirements and deployments for spring plowing production this year; "middle" means the county commercial departments forming key investigation groups to delve into representative people's communes to investigate the deployments and needs for spring plowing this year; "lower" means designating cadres in charge of production materials from the grassroots state-run stores of each people's commune to ascertain the requirements of their commune in spring plowing this year. Subsequently, in November of last year, through a county-wide meeting of grassroots store directors, they specifically analyzed, studied, and understood the characteristics of the needs for production materials in various regions after communization, and separately formulated plans to support agricultural spring plowing production. At the same time, they put forward the resounding slogan of "What the people's communes need, we will supply; how much they need, we will supply; when they need it, we will supply it," launching a mass movement to organize the supply of production materials for spring plowing.

"Materials arrive before the season." In organizing the supply of production materials for spring plowing, the Pingxiang commercial departments first proactively signed 115 industry-commerce production and sales contracts through industry-commerce coordination symposiums with industrial and handicraft departments respectively. According to the needs of communes in various regions, they ordered a large number of water pumps, electric motors, gas engines, rice transplanters, sprayers, deep plows, etc., and through the Party committee, urged these industrial departments to arrange production in a timely manner and deliver goods on schedule. The commercial departments also organized local handicrafts to find and open up sources of goods. For example, grassroots state-run stores in Futian, Shangbu, and Lashi organized over 120 bamboo craftsmen to go deep into mountainous areas with abundant Mao bamboo resources, such as Da'anling and Jiuzhou, to manufacture earth baskets. In addition, the commercial departments also sent a group of people to Fujian, Hunan, and other places to purchase over 10,000 bamboo hats, over 4,000 jin of palm bark, and over 50,000 jin of oiled paper, etc., to supplement the shortage of local sources.

The commercial departments of this county tried their best to help commune-run industries vigorously develop the production and repair of new-style agricultural tools and local fertilizers, forming a powerful network of agricultural tool manufacturing and repair with the county's commune-run industries. After communization in Pingxiang County, over 1,200 commune-run factories were established, which generally could repair large agricultural tools, manufacture small agricultural tools, and produce some local fertilizers. The commercial departments timely seized this vital force to support spring plowing, actively helping and organizing them to vigorously produce production materials. In terms of new agricultural tool manufacturing and repair, the commercial departments first sent people to other places to learn manufacturing techniques, and after returning to the county, they widely imparted them to various places; then, they proactively purchased and supplied a large number of raw materials such as steel wire and wrought iron according to the needs of commune-run industries in manufacturing new-style agricultural tools such as rice transplanters; at the same time, they also organized the supply of a large number of native and foreign machinery and equipment to communes and brigades, helping to equip commune agricultural tool manufacturing plants and establish brigade agricultural tool repair stations. With the help of the commercial departments, industrial enterprises in five communes including Anyuan and Luxi had ten kinds of machines in each factory, such as lathes, planers, drilling machines, and drilling rigs, vigorously developing the manufacturing of new agricultural tools. The commercial departments also actively promoted commune-run industries to vigorously engage in the production of "twelve local products," namely local fertilizers, local pesticides, local cement, local nitrate, local mustard, local white medicine, local electricity, local sulfur, local culverts, local ball bearings, local chemicals, and local steel.

In view of the fact that a large number of agricultural machinery, new-style agricultural tools, local fertilizers, and other technical production materials will be widely used in this year's spring plowing production, the Pingxiang commercial departments proactively strengthened technical support work. First, the commercial departments focused on the training of technical personnel. Last winter, they held technical training classes, training in batches the cadres in charge of production material supply in the county's grassroots state-run stores, so that they first learned the maintenance, installation, and operation methods of new-style agricultural tools; and understood the manufacturing and usage methods of local fertilizers and local pesticides. Through these personnel, they also trained over 5,000 peasant technicians in various communes, basically mastering the manufacturing, maintenance, installation, and usage methods of new-style agricultural tools, fertilizers, pesticides, and other production materials. The staff of the commercial departments also combined purchasing and sales work to impart technology, with technical guidance following wherever agricultural tools were supplied. They were both salespersons and technicians. This approach was welcomed by the masses and also prompted the rapid application of newly supplied production materials to spring plowing production.

    供应生产资料又多又早　帮助公社工业大造农具　主动传授生产技术
    萍乡商业部门全面支援春耕
    本报南昌25日电　江西省萍乡县商业部门大力组织春耕生产资料供应工作，促使全县春耕工作进展迅速，成为江西全省商业战线支援春耕生产的一面红旗。
    据最近统计，全县商业部门已经组织供应农村的土化肥达三十五万多担，平均每亩早稻田达八十多斤；石灰六十九万多斤；犁嘴、犁身一万二千多套；锄、耙七万三千多件；添制和修补各种农业机械和新式农具四十多万件。数量和品种，都比去年增长了30％左右，有力地推动了农村的备耕工作。各公社利用商业部门供应的九千七百多部深耕犁，今年一个来月的深耕改土面积，就超过计划67％。许多社员都反映说：“生产资料供应又早又好，搞起生产来非常顺手，商业部门工作真呱呱叫。”
    萍乡县今年农业生产要求比去年有更大跃进。全县对春耕生产资料的供应要求时间早、数量大、品种多、质量好。根据这些特点，萍乡商业部门早在去年10月间，就主动地组织了一千多名工作人员，通过“上、中、下”三个方面，了解全县在今年春耕生产中对生产资料的需要情况组织供应。“上”，就是主动请示县委，了解县委对今年春耕生产的要求和部署；“中”，就是由县商业部门组成重点调查组，深入具有代表性的人民公社调查今年春耕的部署和需要；“下”，就是指定各人民公社的基层国营商店管生产资料的干部，摸清本公社在今年春耕中的要求。接着，又在去年11月间通过全县基层商店主任会议，专门分析研究和摸清了公社化以后各地对生产资料需要的特点，分别制定了支援农业春耕生产的计划。同时，提出了“人民公社需要什么，就供应什么；需要多少，就供应多少；什么时候需要，就什么时候供应”的响亮口号，开展了一个春耕生产资料的组织供应工作的群众运动。
    “季节未到，物资先行”。萍乡商业部门在组织供应春耕生产资料的工作中，首先主动通过工商协作座谈会，分别与工业、手工业部门签订了一百一十五份工商产销合同。按照各地公社的需要，订购了大批水泵、电动机、煤气机、插秧机、喷雾器、深耕犁等，并通过党委，督促这些工业部门及时安排生产，按期交货。商业部门还组织地方手工业寻找和开辟货源。如富田、上埠、腊市等基层国营商店，就组织了一百二十多名篾工深入到茅竹资源多的大安岭、九州等山区制造土箕。此外，商业部门还派出了一批人员，到福建、湖南等地采购了斗笠一万余顶，棕片四千多斤，油纸五万多斤等，以弥补本地货源的不足。
    这个县的商业部门尽量帮助社办工业，大搞新式农具和土化肥的生产和修配工作，把全县社办工业组成一个强大的农具制造和修配网。萍乡县公社化以后，建立了一千二百多个社办工厂，一般都能修配大农具、制造小农具、生产部分土化肥。商业部门及时抓住了这一支援春耕的有生力量，积极帮助和组织它们大闹生产资料的生产。在新农具制造和修配方面，商业部门首先派人到外地学习了制造技术，回县后分头向各地进行了广泛地传授；接着，又主动根据社办工业制造插秧机等新式农具的需要，采购供应了大量的钢丝、熟铁等原材料；同时，还组织供应了大批土洋机器设备给公社和大队，帮助装备了公社农具制造厂，建立了大队农具修配站。安源、芦溪等五个公社的工业企业在商业部门的帮助下，厂厂有了车床、刨床、钻床、钻眼机等十种机器，大力展开了新农具的制造工作。商业部门还积极推动社办工业大搞“十二土”生产，即土化肥、土农药、土水泥、土硝、土芥、土白药、土电、土硫磺、土涵管、土滚珠、土化工、土钢。
    鉴于大批农业机械、新式农具和土化肥等技术性较强的生产资料、将被广泛地使用到今年春耕生产中去，萍乡商业部门主动加强了技术支援工作。首先，商业部门抓住了技术力量的培训工作。去年冬季就举办了技术训练班，分批训练了全县各基层国营商店负责生产资料供应工作的干部，使他们首先学会了新式农具的维修、安装、操作方法；懂得了土化肥、土农药的制造和使用方法。通过这些人员，又分别在各个公社训练了五千多名农民技术员，基本掌握了新式农具、化肥、农药等生产资料的制造、维修、安装和使用方法。商业部门的工作人员，还结合购销工作传授技术，农具供应到哪里，技术指导也就跟到那里。既是营业员，又是技术员。这样做，既受到群众的欢迎，又促使新供应的生产资料迅速运用到春耕生产中去。
