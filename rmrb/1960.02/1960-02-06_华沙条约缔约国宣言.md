    Declaration of the Warsaw Treaty Member States:
    The Warsaw Treaty member states note with satisfaction that the international situation has improved to some extent since the meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty Organization in May 1958. For the first time after years of the "Cold War," normal peacetime relations have begun to be established between countries participating in mutually opposing blocs, the tense situation has been significantly eased, and the path for strengthening mutual trust has been opened. The world has now entered a stage of negotiated solutions to major international disputes to establish lasting peace, and the advocates of the "Cold War" have suffered defeat.
    The basis for this improvement in the international situation is the significant change in the balance of power on the world stage in recent years.
    In recent years, the economic strength of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries has flourished, and they have further united within the unified socialist camp. In these years, the Soviet Union has achieved great accomplishments in science and technology. The entry of the first artificial Earth satellite into orbit, the launching of rockets to the surface of the moon, and the exploration of the secrets of the moon's far side, which never faces Earth—these are the magnificent results of the world's first socialist country, results that have elevated humanity's struggle to understand and conquer the forces of nature to a new stage.
    Finally, the past few years have been marked by a new surge in the initiatives of the socialist camp countries aimed at consolidating peace, and the further enhancement of the international role of Asian, African, and Latin American peace-loving countries in shaking off colonial and semi-colonial dependence.
    As a result, the balance of world power is increasingly favoring those who advocate the cessation of the rocket-nuclear and other arms race, the elimination of the "Cold War," and the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems and ideologies. A situation has been created in which any attempt by an aggressor state to resort to force to resolve international disputes and embark on the path of war is bound to lead to the immediate and complete crushing of the disruptor of peace.
    In the consciousness of the peoples of all countries, and in the minds of many politicians and state activists (including Western politicians and state activists), there is a growing recognition that, given the current level of development of weapons of mass destruction and the tools to deliver them to any corner of the globe in an instant, war can no longer be a method of resolving international disputes; the only practically feasible path is to build relations between countries on the basis of peaceful coexistence.
    The participants feel deeply satisfied that forms of international contact such as meetings and talks between national leaders of Eastern and Western countries are gaining increasing significance. This type of contact, which the Warsaw Treaty member states have consistently advocated developing, has, as experience has shown, significant positive implications.
    The historic visit of Soviet Premier Khrushchev to the United States and his talks with U.S. President Eisenhower played a particularly prominent role in this regard. As a result of this visit, the "Cold War" ice between the world's two most powerful nations—the Soviet Union and the United States—was broken, opening a new stage in the development of overall international relations. It is well known that the negotiations between the leaders of the Soviet and British governments during Prime Minister Macmillan's visit to Moscow were also of great significance for the improvement of the international atmosphere.
    The participants hope that Comrade Khrushchev's upcoming visit to France, as well as the visit of Italian President Gronchi to the Soviet Union, will lead to further strengthening of mutual relations between countries, especially European countries, and will promote the consolidation of world peace.
    The unanimous common hope of the participants is that U.S. President Eisenhower's visit to the Soviet Union this summer will enable further development of Soviet-American relations on the path of friendship and cooperation, which will be an important guarantee for ensuring the inviolability of world peace.
    The recently expanded mutual visits of national activists have become a stabilizing factor in the growing rapprochement between socialist camp countries and the peace-loving independent countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
    Friendly meetings and talks between the leaders of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of Poland, the Czechoslovak Republic, the German Democratic Republic, the Romanian People's Republic, and other Warsaw Treaty member states, and the leaders of countries such as India, Indonesia, Burma, Cambodia, Afghanistan, the United Arab Republic, Ethiopia, and Guinea, have contributed to the smooth development of peaceful coexistence in vast regions of the world. All participants expressed their determination to continue to strengthen and develop friendship with the peace-loving countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America on the basis of equality and mutual respect, for the benefit of peace.
    The improvement in the international situation has already borne fruit in many aspects of international relations.
    At the end of 1959, twelve countries, including the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, concluded an important agreement on the peaceful use of the Antarctic region, according to which this vast and temporarily uninhabited continent will be completely prohibited from engaging in any form of war preparation activities, including nuclear testing, and will be designated as an area for peaceful research and scientific cooperation among all countries. The decision adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 1959 to establish a standing committee of the United Nations for the peaceful use of outer space is a beneficial step in the right direction. Seven Warsaw Treaty member states participate in this committee: Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia.
    The participants also pointed out that influential forces in Western countries are still stubbornly opposed to strengthening peace. These are either groups whose eyes are blinded by the profits generated by weapons production and cannot see the fatal dangers they would face in the event of war, or politicians who are so deeply frozen in the ice of the "Cold War" that they cannot imagine normal peaceful international relations.
    The member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization not only maintain large armies, but also continue to increase the number of troops, paying particular attention to the West German Federal Defense Forces commanded by former Hitlerite generals. The Federal Defense Forces are equipped with rocket weapons. The path to the production of such weapons has been opened for the Federal Republic of Germany, and further measures are being taken to equip the Federal Defense Forces with atomic weapons. The fact that the NATO Council meeting in December 1959 studied plans to further expand the armed forces of the member states of this bloc is an obvious fact.
    While West German militarism is strengthening, Japanese militarist forces are also becoming increasingly active, and the country is being further drawn into war preparation activities, as evidenced by the recent signing of the new US-Japan military treaty.
    The continued arms expansion by members of NATO, as well as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization, and their allies, cannot be justified by defensive purposes. This proves that those who oppose peaceful coexistence have not laid down their arms. This is also proven by the fact that influential military and political figures in Western countries, as well as some newspapers, frequently promote distrust and hatred between countries with different social systems. Those who oppose strengthening peace are unwilling to hold negotiations on resolving international disputes, and even when the possibility of reaching an agreement has clearly emerged, they try to obstruct the agreement.
    However, no attempt by the advocates of the "Cold War" can change the fact that the awareness of the need for peaceful coexistence is now becoming the determining factor in the development of international relations. The configuration of forces on the international stage guarantees that the peace-loving countries occupy an advantage, and the forces of peace greatly outweigh the forces of war. This creates favorable conditions for achieving the goals that the Warsaw Treaty member states have consistently striven for: easing international tensions and developing friendly cooperation among all countries.
    Of course, the issue of disarmament should be given top priority. This is the main issue in contemporary international life. Whether or not it is possible to completely eliminate the possibility of a new war depends on the resolution of this issue, and under current conditions, a new war would lead to the death of billions of people and the destruction of entire countries.
    The interests of humanity require preventing the use of rocket-nuclear weapons with unprecedented destructive power. The most reliable way to achieve this goal is to destroy all types of weapons, all tools of war, that is, complete and thorough disarmament by all countries. Therefore, the disarmament proposal made by the Soviet Union to the United Nations is in line with the most pressing interests of mankind. The great impact and influence of this Soviet proposal on the peoples of all countries lies in this. It is significant that the member states of the United Nations unanimously endorsed the idea of complete and thorough disarmament at the recently concluded 14th General Assembly. It is pleasing that the resolution was adopted on the basis of a joint draft resolution by two major powers, the Soviet Union and the United States.
    In order for countries to reach a disarmament agreement and make it a reality for the first time in history, it is first necessary to move from words to practical actions. This is the most important historical task of our generation. The Warsaw Treaty member states exchanged views on the prospects for the upcoming disarmament negotiations at this meeting, and concluded that there are now more favorable prerequisites than ever before for effective disarmament negotiations between Eastern and Western countries.
    The Soviet government's disarmament proposals to the United Nations reflect the common position of the Warsaw Treaty member states, all socialist countries. All Warsaw Treaty member states declare their willingness to participate in future agreements on complete and thorough disarmament.
    The countries attending the meeting are satisfied that the first to take practical steps to implement the above-mentioned resolution of the United Nations was the member state of the Warsaw Treaty Organization - the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has decided to unilaterally reduce its armed forces by 1.2 million men. Now, the number of Soviet armed forces will be lower than the level that Western countries themselves proposed to the Soviet Union and the United States in 1956, and also less than the actual number of US armed forces, even though the United States has much less territory and a much shorter border than the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is reducing its current number of armed forces by one-third, under the conditions that Western military blocs continue the arms race. This is an action with sincerity, which should prompt other countries to take corresponding measures in disarmament, and to respond to trust with trust.
    Some in the West intend to distort any good thing and any good start in international affairs, reversing right and wrong. Now, the enemies of disarmament are doing just that, insisting that the Soviet Union's renewed reduction of armed forces is not a measure of disarmament, but rather of rearmament. Such a frivolous statement can only be conceived by demonstrating obvious insincerity in the face of disarmament facts.
    Everyone knows that only a country without aggressive intentions would unilaterally reduce its armed forces. For a country's defense, under current conditions, huge armies and military bases in foreign territories are not needed. Would a country that is formulating aggression plans voluntarily reduce its armed forces? Obviously, even while reorganizing these armed forces to strengthen their combat effectiveness, reducing the number of armed forces would not be in the interests of such a country.
    The countries participating in the meeting believe that the Soviet Union's decision, made after consultation with other countries in the socialist camp, to once again substantially reduce its armed forces, is a general contribution of the Warsaw Treaty Organization to the cause of disarmament, and an initiative that will help Eastern and Western countries reach an agreement on complete and thorough disarmament. The countries participating in the Warsaw Treaty Organization have consistently and firmly pursued a policy of ending the arms race. Since its inception, the Warsaw Treaty Organization has reduced the total number of armed forces of the contracting states by 2,596,500 men, and the current unilateral disarmament by the Soviet Union brings this figure to 3,796,500 men. Can the countries that have joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization also write such measures (whose significance for consolidating peace is obvious to all) on their own accounts? Unfortunately, until now, the measures taken by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have been aimed at intensifying war preparations, increasing armed forces and armaments.
    The Warsaw Treaty Organization member states deem it necessary to emphasize the good example of the German Democratic Republic. The German Democratic Republic automatically reduced the number of its armed forces to 90,000 men, and no longer implements mandatory military service. This stance of the German Democratic Republic, in trying its best to promote the easing of tense situation, is fully supported by all countries of the Warsaw Treaty. The German Democratic Republic has demonstrated through its own policies that if the German state abandons atomic armament, abandons its policies of revenge, boundary revision, and militarism, it is able to live in peace and tranquility, and occupy its due place in the family of nations. This fact has great significance for the cause of peace and the national future of Germany.
    The countries participating in the meeting call on the participating countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, especially those with the strongest military strength, to reduce their armed forces in response to the Soviet Union's unilateral reduction of armed forces, and to emulate the Soviet Union's example.
    The participants in the meeting believe that the Soviet Union's proposals on disarmament should be fully discussed at the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting to be held on March 15 this year. To this end, they agreed that the governments of the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria, which are the Warsaw Treaty member states participating in the Ten-Nation Committee, will instruct their representatives in this committee to do their best to promote the committee's effective work, and strive to draft a treaty on complete and thorough disarmament as soon as possible.
    For the issue of complete and thorough disarmament to be resolved quickly and satisfactorily, it naturally requires not only the efforts of the Warsaw Treaty member states, but also the same efforts from the Western countries. The participants hope that Western countries will also contribute to the cause of resolving the issue of disarmament as soon as possible.
    If both sides are sincerely committed to reaching an agreement, it is possible to avoid the recurrence of a situation where efforts to reach a disarmament agreement are submerged in endless rhetoric and grandiose resolutions.
    For the smooth implementation of complete and thorough disarmament, an effective international supervision system must be established for such disarmament. Supervision that is divorced from actual steps in disarmament may, under current conditions, be used to achieve purposes that are completely contrary to disarmament: to find loopholes in the defense systems of other countries, and to collect intelligence that would help develop plans to attack a certain country. Therefore, countries without aggressive intentions naturally hope that the scale of international supervision should be in line with the actual degree of disarmament of each country. Under the conditions of complete and thorough disarmament, there will be no reason for countries to guard against each other. There will be every possibility to implement any inspection, any investigation. Since disarmament will be comprehensive and thorough, then supervision will also be all-encompassing and thorough.
    The participating countries deem it necessary to reiterate their hope to reach a disarmament agreement that should ensure that people are completely convinced that no country can violate the obligation to implement disarmament and will be able to secretly arm itself.
    The Warsaw Treaty member states also pointed out a positive fact: for a long time, there has not been an atomic bomb or hydrogen bomb explosion in any corner of the world. However, although nuclear explosions have temporarily ceased, there is still no international agreement banning nuclear explosions. The people of all countries hope not only to cease fire on the nuclear testing front, they expect a permanent ban on such tests. Some attempts to reverse the positive progress that has actually been made on the road to stopping nuclear testing have also caused unease.
    If one party actually resumes testing, it may cause a chain reaction, and as a result, our planet will once again become an arena for experimental nuclear weapons explosions, resulting in all dangerous consequences. It is also difficult to reconcile this situation with the resolutions of the United Nations, because the United Nations has unanimously called on the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, which are participating in the Geneva talks, not to resume nuclear weapons testing and to accelerate the conclusion of an international agreement on this issue.
    The Soviet government has decided that as long as Western countries do not resume nuclear test explosions, the Soviet government will continue not to conduct nuclear tests in the future. This decision by the Soviet government has created favorable conditions for completing the work of formulating an agreement on stopping nuclear weapons testing. The participating countries hope that all participants in the Geneva talks will make maximum efforts to strive to stop testing various types of nuclear weapons in the air, on land, underground, and underwater in the shortest possible time.
    The participating countries exchanged views in detail on the German question.
    The Warsaw Treaty member states have more than once experienced what German aggression brings to the peoples of various countries. All of these countries share a common concern that German militarism will never again threaten the security of its neighbors and world peace. This concern has prompted them to firmly advocate the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. Eliminating the remnants of World War II and concluding a peace treaty are necessary for the development of the entire German nation, and also to convince the people of all countries that there is already a solid barrier to prevent the outbreak of a new war in Europe.
    While the German Democratic Republic has expressed its complete willingness to begin negotiations and conclude a peace treaty at any time, the other Germany—the Federal Republic of Germany—opposes the conclusion of this treaty. An unprecedented and abnormal situation has now formed: a country that was on the side of the defeated—one of the successors of the aggressor who surrendered unconditionally fifteen years ago—actually refuses to conclude a peace treaty.
    The policy of the Federal Republic of Germany aims to obstruct the smooth conduct of negotiations by major powers and obstruct the resolution of outstanding international issues, and even attempts to obliterate the results that have already been achieved in the negotiation process, such as attempting to obliterate the convergence of views reached by the participants of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference in 1959 on certain issues.
    Why is the government of the Federal Republic of Germany so stubbornly obstructing the conclusion of a peace treaty? The reason it does this is primarily because the mission of the peace treaty is to fix the established post-war situation (including German borders), and the government of the Federal Republic of Germany opposes this. Only one conclusion can be drawn: the government of the Federal Republic of Germany hopes that one day it will be possible to revise the boundaries that were determined in Europe due to the collapse of fascist Germany. But under current conditions, this is practically equivalent to adopting a policy of launching a new war, because the countries to which the Federal Republic of Germany attempts to make territorial claims will never relinquish their land, and the government of the Federal Republic of Germany must understand this. All sober-minded people understand that these boundaries are inviolable.
    The Warsaw Treaty member states resolutely declare that such hopes of the West German government are doomed to failure. The German Democratic Republic, as a reliable fortress of peace, stands in the way of German militarists heading toward new aggressive adventures. The Warsaw Treaty member states declare that they support the measures taken by the German Democratic Republic to safeguard peace and oppose the revanchist policies of the Adenauer government. The combined power of the socialist camp reliably guarantees that the independence of the German Democratic Republic will not be violated, the western territories of Poland will no longer be occupied, and the inviolability of the borders of Czechoslovakia will not be undermined.
    The participants expressed their belief that the plans of the West German revanchists will not be supported by the current allies of the Federal Republic of Germany. The participants firmly believe that the plans of the West German revanchists cannot be supported and must not be supported by the peace-loving residents of the Federal Republic of Germany. The participants are convinced that the residents of West Germany should be given a better fate, and should not be turned into tools in the hands of peace disruptors. The greedy imperialist policies of the German rulers have in the past more than once turned the German people into tools in their hands, and the German people have therefore paid a heavy price more than once.
    Concluding a peace treaty, abandoning all thoughts of revenge and boundary revision, and abandoning the policy of German re-militarization and atomic armament are the best ways to guarantee the security of the people of all countries in Europe and the peaceful future of the German people. The German Democratic Republic has consistently advocated taking this path. If the Federal Republic of Germany can also embark on this path, it will be its most convincing contribution to strengthening peace and promoting the cause of complete and thorough disarmament. The government of the Federal Republic of Germany rejected the proposal to conclude a peace treaty because it does not want to solve the West Berlin problem on the basis of turning West Berlin into a free city. It actually demands that West Berlin, which is located within the territory of the German Democratic Republic, be incorporated into West Germany. If this cannot be done, it wants to maintain the occupation system there, in order to use West Berlin as a source of unrest and military danger. The government of the Federal Republic of Germany is an enemy of reconciliation with Germany because it is unwilling to peacefully resolve the issue of German unification through negotiations between the two Germanys and the conclusion of a peace treaty. It disregards common sense and refuses to see that two Germanys that have chosen different paths of development have existed for more than ten years. The government of the Federal Republic of Germany refuses to consider the fundamental interests of the German people, and rejects the proposal repeatedly made to it by the government of the German Democratic Republic to unify the country by negotiating with the German Democratic Republic, which is the only possible way. In this way, the government of the Federal Republic of Germany has demonstrated its hostility towards the cause of German unification.
    The government of the Federal Republic of Germany does not want to hear about a peace treaty because it fears that the conclusion of a peace treaty will eliminate the situation that has formed in West Germany, in which people are prosecuted simply because they dare to defend their progressive beliefs, dare to safeguard the national rights and peace interests of the German people. All actions of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany show that it is gradually paving the way for the establishment of a regime in West Germany that will create a facade of democracy, but in essence will be close to the regime that once plunged the world into a bloody war and led the German people to an unprecedented national disaster. Otherwise, how could the fascists launch such vile and shameless Nazi-style anti-Semitic provocations in West Germany? This attack has recently been witnessed by the whole world. The government of the Federal Republic of Germany shamelessly protects the planners of this despicable activity, and some officials of the Federal Republic of Germany are even using the usual tactics of the Hitlerites to provocatively try to shift the blame to the communists.
    All of this can only deepen the distrust of the people of all countries towards the policies of the Federal Republic of Germany. In this situation, it is necessary to carry out a more active struggle to strive for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.
    The countries represented at this meeting advocate the establishment of peaceful cooperation and good-neighborly relations with all countries, including the Federal Republic of Germany, and will spare no effort to strive for the establishment of such cooperation in practice.
    The Warsaw Treaty member states hope to reach a reconciliation with Germany together with other allied and associated powers that participated in the war against Germany. This means concluding a peace treaty with Germany; this treaty can be signed by the two Germanys under current circumstances. But they cannot agree to indefinitely delay the resolution of these issues, because this can only encourage the militarist and revanchist forces in West Germany.
    If efforts to conclude a peace treaty with the two Germanys are not supported, and if the resolution of this issue is delayed, then the countries participating in this meeting have no choice but to conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic, together with other countries willing to conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic, and to resolve the West Berlin issue on this basis.
    The countries represented at this meeting reiterate that they are consistently committed to improving relations between Eastern and Western countries, strengthening trust between Eastern and Western countries, and developing various forms of international cooperation. As in the past, they advocate the unimpeded development of international trade, strengthening contacts between national activists, social activists, and social groups, and advocating the exchange of cultural, scientific, and technological achievements that can increase the wealth of the people of all countries.
    Stopping war propaganda, stopping provocative clamoring, and stopping attempts to threaten with the use of force are of great significance for the improvement of the international situation and the elimination of suspicion in relations between countries.
    As for the Warsaw Treaty member states, war propaganda is prohibited by law in these countries, and these countries are prepared to take further measures to allow the atmosphere of mutual vigilance and sharp dispute in relations between countries to give way to goodwill and trust.
    Under the circumstances of a significant easing of international tensions, the proposal to conclude a mutual non-aggression pact between the two blocs of countries - the Warsaw Treaty Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - has greater significance than in previous years, and this proposal has not yet been positively resolved. The participants firmly believe that the urgency of concluding a mutual non-aggression pact between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty Organization has not weakened, but has increased year by year. Therefore, the participants deem it necessary to declare that this proposal remains valid, and they are prepared to sign a mutual non-aggression pact with the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization at any time.
    The signing of bilateral mutual non-aggression treaties between countries belonging to different military blocs, as well as the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free and rocket-weapon-free zones in Europe, will also play a significant role in improving the international situation.
    The participants are very pleased to welcome the agreement reached by the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France on holding a summit conference in Paris in May this year. The governments of the Warsaw Treaty member states have long been striving to convene such a meeting, and as they pointed out in their declaration on May 24, 1958, they believe that the summit conference "under current conditions is an extremely important means of saving mankind from the disaster of war and turning the international situation in the direction of consolidating peace."
    The Warsaw Treaty member states believe that the most important and mature issues, such as the issue of complete and thorough disarmament, the issue of a peace treaty with Germany (including the issue of establishing a free city in West Berlin), the issue of banning the testing of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, and the issue of relations between East and West, should be discussed at the upcoming meeting of heads of government. The participating countries firmly believe that as long as reasonable consideration is given to the interests of all parties and there is a joint commitment to peace, any international dispute, no matter how complex, can be resolved. Therefore, they hope that the heads of government can find the correct path towards the smooth resolution of the above-mentioned issues, to the benefit of consolidating universal peace, and hope that the upcoming summit conference can become a turning point in relations between Eastern and Western countries.
    The Warsaw Treaty member states believe that at present, on the eve of important talks between the leaders of Eastern and Western countries, and on the eve of the convening of the summit conference, it is particularly important that all countries make every effort to create an environment that will help the upcoming talks achieve a successful outcome. The countries participating in the meeting declare that they will work in this regard, and call on all other countries to promote the success of the talks between East and West, and to abandon any steps that may complicate the talks.
    The governments of the Warsaw Treaty member states are satisfied to confirm that their unremitting efforts to stop the arms race, eliminate dangerous sources of international conflict, and eliminate the "Cold War" have received increasingly broad support from the people of all countries in the world, and have yielded positive results. They unanimously agree that in our era, there is no, and cannot be, a task more great and more sublime than promoting the guarantee of lasting world peace.

    华沙条约缔约国宣言
    新华社5日讯　塔斯社莫斯科4日电：华沙条约缔约国宣言：
    华沙条约缔约国满意地指出，自从1958年5月举行华沙条约组织政治协商委员会会议以来，国际形势有了一定的好转。在多年的“冷战”之后第一次在参加互相对立的集团的国家之间开始确立和平时期的正常关系，紧张局势有了明显的缓和，打开了加强互相信任的道路。现在，世界已进入了谈判解决主要的国际争端问题以建立持久和平的阶段，“冷战”的拥护者遭到了失败。
    作为这种国际形势改善的基础的是近年来在世界舞台上力量对比发生的重大变化。
    最近几年来，苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义各国的经济力量蓬勃发展，它们在统一的社会主义阵营里进一步地团结起来了。这几年来，苏联在科学技术方面获得了极大的成就。第一个人造地球卫星进入轨道，发射火箭到月球表面上去，并且探索从不朝向地球的月球背面的秘密，——这就是世界上第一个社会主义国家的这些成就的宏伟结果，这些结果把人类为认识和征服自然力量而进行的斗争提高到了新阶段。
    最后，过去几年的标志是社会主义阵营各国旨在巩固和平的积极性的新高涨，以及亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲摆脱殖民地、半殖民地从属地位的爱好和平的国家的国际作用进一步提高。
    结果，世界力量对比变得越来越有利于主张停止火箭—核及其他军备竞赛、主张消除“冷战”、主张社会制度和意识形态不同的各国和平共处的人。形成了这样一种局面：任何侵略国家诉诸武力解决国际争端问题、走上战争道路的任何企图，势必导致和平的破坏者立即遭到彻底的粉碎。
    在各国人民的意识中，在许多政治家和国家活动家（其中也包括西方的政治家和国家活动家）的心目中，日益认为：在今天大规模毁灭性武器和一瞬间把它送到地球上任何角落的工具所达到的发展水平下，战争绝不能再作为解决国际争端的方法；唯一实际可行的道路，就是把各国之间的关系建立在和平共处的基础上。
    与会者深深感到满意的是，东西方各国的国家领导人士会晤和会谈这样的国际接触形式，获得了越来越大的意义。华沙条约缔约国一贯主张加以发展的这种接触，如经验所表明，具有重大的积极意义。
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫的具有历史意义的访美和他同美国总统艾森豪威尔的会谈，在这方面起了特别显著的作用。由于这次访问，打碎了世界上两个最强盛的国家——苏联和美国之间的关系中“冷战”的冰块，在整个国际关系的发展中打开了一个新阶段。大家知道，英国首相麦克米伦访问莫斯科期间苏英两国政府领导人之间举行的谈判，对于国际气氛的健康化也具有重大的意义。
    与会者希望，赫鲁晓夫同志即将到法国的访问以及意大利共和国总统格隆基到苏联的访问，能导致各国之间、首先是欧洲国家之间互相关系的进一步加强，能促进世界和平的巩固。
    与会者一致的共同的希望是：今年夏季美国总统艾森豪威尔到苏联的访问，能使苏美两国关系在友好和合作的道路上有进一步的发展，这将是保证世界和平牢不可破的一个重要保证。
    近来扩大的国家活动家的互访，成了社会主义阵营国家和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的和平独立国家之间互相接近的稳定因素。
    苏联、波兰人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国、德意志民主共和国、罗马尼亚人民共和国和华沙条约其他缔约国领导人，同印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、柬埔寨、阿富汗、阿拉伯联合共和国、埃塞俄比亚、几内亚等这样一些国家领导人的友好会晤和会谈，有助于世界广大地区的和平共处在实践中的顺利发展。全体与会者表示决心，今后要继续同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲爱好和平的国家在平等和互相尊重的基础上加强和发展友谊，以利于和平。
    国际局势的好转已经在国际关系的许多方面结下了自己的果实。
    1959年底，包括苏联、美国、英国和法国在内的十二个国家缔结了一项关于和平利用南极地带的重要协定，根据这项协定，这个辽阔而暂时还没有人定居的大陆将完全禁止进行包括核试验在内的任何形式的备战活动，并确定作为各国进行和平研究和科学合作的区域。1959年12月联合国大会通过的建立联合国和平利用宇宙常设委员会的决定，是朝正确方向迈出的有益的一步。参加这个委员会的有七个华沙条约缔约国：阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、波兰、罗马尼亚、苏联和捷克斯洛伐克。
    与会者同时指出，西方国家有影响的势力仍然在顽固地反对加强和平。这些人要么是那些被生产武器带来的利润遮住眼睛而看不到一旦爆发战争他们就会遇到的致命危险的集团，要么就是深深地冻在“冷战”的冰层里以致于无法想像正常的和平国际关系的政治家。
    北大西洋公约组织缔约国不但仍然保持着庞大的军队，而且在不断增加军队人数，特别注意于由前希特勒将领指挥的西德联邦国防军。联邦国防军配备了火箭武器。在德意志联邦共和国面前开辟了通向生产这种武器的道路，不仅如此，还在用原子武器装备联邦国防军方面采取进一步的措施。1959年12月北大西洋公约组织理事会会议研究了进一步扩大这个集团的成员国的武装部队的计划，这就是一个明摆着的事实。
    与西德军国主义加强的同时，日本军国主义势力也明显地日益活跃，这个国家被进一步拖入备战活动，最近美日新军事条约的签订就证明了这一点。
    北大西洋公约组织、以及东南亚条约组织和中央条约组织的成员与它们的盟国继续扩充军备，这决不能拿防御目的来辩解。这证明，反对和平共处的人还没有放下武器。西方国家有影响的军政界人士以及一部分报刊经常宣传不同社会制度国家之间的不信任和仇恨，也证明了这一点。反对加强和平的人不愿意举行关于解决国际争执问题的谈判，并且甚至当已经明显地出现达成协议的可能性的时候，他们也竭力阻挠达成协议。
    但是，“冷战”的拥护者的任何企图也不能改变这一事实：意识到和平共处的必要性，现今正成为国际关系发展中的决定因素。国际舞台上力量的配置保证爱好和平国家占优势，和平力量大大超过战争力量。这就创造了有利的条件来达到华沙条约缔约国始终如一地为之奋斗的目标：缓和国际紧张局势和发展各国友好合作。
    当然，裁军问题应当提到首位。这是当代国际生活中的主要问题。能否完全排除新战争的可能性，取决于这个问题的解决，而在目前条件下，新战争会导致亿万人的死亡和整个整个国家的毁灭。
    人类利益要求防止使用具有空前毁灭力量的火箭——核武器。而达到这一目的的最可靠的道路就是销毁一切类型的武器、一切战争工具，也就是各国全面彻底裁军。因此，苏联向联合国提出的这种裁军建议符合人类最迫切的利益。苏联这一建议对各国人民所产生的巨大影响作用力就在于此。联合国会员国在已经闭幕的第十四届大会上一致赞同全面彻底裁军的主张，这是有重要意义的。令人愉快的是，就苏联和美国这样两个大国联合起草的决议案通过了决议。
    为了使各国达成裁军协定在历史上第一次成为现实，首先必须从言论转向采取实际行动。这是我们这一代人最重要的历史任务。华沙条约缔约国在本次会议上就将要举行的裁军谈判前景问题交换了意见，并且得出这样结论：对于东西方国家进行有成效的裁军谈判来说，现在比以往任何时候更具备有利的前提。
    苏联政府在联合国提出的裁军建议反映了华沙条约缔约国，所有社会主义国家的共同立场。所有华沙条约缔约国声明它们愿意参加未来的全面彻底裁军协定。
    出席会议的国家感到满意的是，第一个采取实际措施实现联合国上述决议的是华沙条约组织的成员国——苏联。苏联决定单方面将本国武装部队裁减一百二十万人。现在，苏联武装部队的人数将低于西方国家自己在1956年对苏联和美国提出的水平，也少于美国武装部队的实际人数，尽管美国的领土比苏联小得多，美国的国界比苏联短得多。苏联把武装部队现有数目裁减三分之一，是在西方国家军事集团继续进行军备竞赛的条件下进行的。这是具有诚意的行动，这应该促使其他国家在裁军方面采取相应的措施，以信任回答信任。
    西方有人打算把国际事务中任何一件好事和任何一件良好的开端都加以歪曲，颠倒是非。现在，裁军的敌人正是这样做的，他们硬说苏联又一次裁减武装部队不是裁军的措施，而是重新武装。只有在裁军的事实面前表示出明显的不诚意，才能想出这种轻率的说法。
    谁都知道，只有没有侵略意图的国家才会单方面裁减本国武装部队。对一个国家的国防来说，在目前条件下，并不需要庞大的军队和在别国领土上设立军事基地。难道一个在拟订侵略计划的国家会自愿裁减自己的武装部队吗？显然，即使在改组这些武装部队以便加强它们战斗力的时候，裁减武装部队的人数也不符合这种国家的利益。
    参加会议的国家认为，经过同社会主义阵营其他国家协商后所作出的苏联再次大量裁减自己武装部队的决定，是华沙条约组织对裁军事业的总贡献，是有助于东西方国家之间达成全面彻底裁军协议的倡议。参加华沙条约组织的国家始终如一地、坚定地奉行着结束军备竞赛的方针。华沙条约组织从它成立的时候起，已经使缔约国家武装部队的总人数裁减了二百五十九万六千五百人，而目前苏联单方面的裁军，使这个数字达到三百七十九万六千五百人。加入北大西洋公约组织的国家是否也能够在自己的账上把这样的措施（这种措施对巩固和平的意义是有目共睹的）也写上一笔呢？遗憾的是，直到目前为止，北大西洋公约组织的措施还是旨在加紧进行备战，增加武装部队和军备。
    华沙条约组织缔约国认为有必要强调指出德意志民主共和国的良好榜样。德意志民主共和国自动把自己武装部队的人数减少到九万人，并且不再实行义务兵役制。德意志民主共和国为了尽力促进缓和紧张局势的这种立场，受到华沙条约所有国家的完全支持。德意志民主共和国以自己的政策表明，如果德意志国家放弃原子武装、放弃复仇的、修改疆界和军国主义的政策，它是能够生活在和平和安宁之中，并在各国人民的大家庭中占有应有的地位的。这一事实对和平事业和德国的民族前途具有重大的意义。
    参加会议的国家呼吁北大西洋公约组织的参加国，特别是其中拥有最强大军事力量的国家，裁减自己的武装部队，来响应苏联单方面裁减武装部队的做法，仿效苏联的榜样。
    会议参加者认为，苏联关于裁军的建议应当在今年3月15日开会的十国裁军委员会上全面地加以讨论。为此，他们商定：苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚和保加利亚，也就是参加十国委员会的华沙条约缔约国的政府，将指示自己在这一委员会中的代表尽力促进委员会有成效地工作，并争取尽速起草全面彻底裁军的条约。
    要使全面彻底裁军问题得到迅速圆满的解决，自然要求不仅华沙条约缔约国作出努力，也要求西方国家作出同样的努力。与会者希望西方国家也对尽速解决裁军问题的事业作出贡献。
    双方如果真诚地致力于达成协议，就可以避免重新出现这样一种情况：对达成裁军协议所作的努力都被淹没在滔滔不绝的言谈和洋洋大观的决议之中。
    要使全面彻底裁军顺利实现，必须对这种裁军建立有效的国际监督制度。脱离裁军实际步骤的监督，在目前的条件下可能被利用来达到同裁军完全背道而驰的目的：在别国的国防系统中寻找缺口，收集有助于制定进攻某个国家的计划的情报。因此，没有侵略意图的国家自然希望，国际监督的规模应该符合各国裁军的实际程度。在全面彻底裁军的条件下，各国不会有理由互相提防。将会有一切可能实现任何检查、任何调查。裁军既然将是全面的、彻底的，那末监督也将是无所不包的、彻底的。
    与会国认为有必要再次强调它们希望达成这样的裁军协定：这个协定应当保证人们完全相信，没有一个国家能违反实现裁军的义务和会有可能秘密地进行武装。
    华沙条约缔约国还指出了一个积极的事实：世界上任何一个角落已经长期没有一个原子弹和氢弹爆炸过了。然而，核爆炸虽然暂时没有进行，却还没有一项禁止核爆炸的国际协定。各国人民希望不单单在核试验这条战线上停战，他们期望永远禁止这种试验。想扭转停止核试验的道路上实际上已经取得的积极进展的某种企图，也引起了不安。
    如果某一方真正恢复试验，那就可能引起某种链锁反应，结果，我们这个星球又会再次变成核武器试验性爆炸的竞技场，从而产生一切危险后果。也很难使这种情况同联合国的决议协调起来，因为联合国一致呼吁参加日内瓦谈判的苏联、美国和英国不要恢复核武器试验并加速缔结关于这个问题的国际协定。
    苏联政府决定，只要西方国家不恢复核试验爆炸，苏联政府今后仍将不进行核试验，苏联政府的这个决定为完成制定关于停止核武器试验协定的工作创造了有利条件。与会国希望，日内瓦谈判的全体参加者将尽最大限度的努力，以便争取在最短期间在空中、地上、地下和水下停止试验各种类型的核武器。
    与会国就德国问题详细地交换了意见。
    华沙条约缔约国不止一次地经历过：德国侵略给各国人民带来什么。所有这些国家共同关心的是永远不使德国军国主义再威胁它的邻国的安全和世界和平。这种关心促使它们坚决主张缔结对德和约。消除第二次世界大战残迹和缔结和约是整个德国的发展所必需的，而且也是为了使各国人民相信：已经有了防止欧洲新战争爆发的牢固的壁障。
    在德意志民主共和国表示完全愿意在任何时候开始谈判和缔结和约的同时，另一个德国——德意志联邦共和国却反对缔结这个条约。现在形成了这样一种史无前例的不正常局面：作为战败者一方——已在十五年前无条件投降的侵略者的继承者之一的国家，竟拒绝缔结和约。
    德意志联邦共和国的政策的目的在于阻挠大国顺利地进行谈判和阻挠解决悬而未决的国际问题，甚至还企图抹煞谈判过程中已经取得的成果，例如企图抹煞1959年日内瓦外长会议参加者在某些问题上取得的各方观点的接近。
    为什么德意志联邦共和国政府这样顽固地阻挠缔结和约呢？它所以要这样做，首先是因为和约的使命是把战后的既定局面（包括德国国界）固定下来，而德意志联邦共和国政府反对这一点。只能得出一个结论：德意志联邦共和国政府指望会有一天有可能修改由于法西斯德国崩溃而在欧洲确定的疆界。但是在目前条件下，这实际上等于采取发动新战争的方针，因为德意志联邦共和国企图对之提出领土要求的那些国家，都决不会舍弃自己的土地，德意志联邦共和国政府必须明了这一点。一切头脑清醒的人都懂得这种疆界是不可破坏的。
    华沙条约缔约国坚决声明，西德政府的这种指望注定是要失败的。德意志民主共和国作为和平的可靠堡垒，阻挡着德国军国主义者走向新的侵略冒险的道路。华沙条约缔约国声明，它们支持德意志民主共和国政府为了保障和平、反对阿登纳政府的复仇政策而采取的措施。社会主义阵营的联合威力可靠地保证着德意志民主共和国的独立不受到侵犯、波兰西部地区不再被占领、捷克斯洛伐克边界的不可侵犯性不被破坏。
    与会者表示相信，西德复仇主义者的计划不会得到德意志联邦共和国现今的盟国的支持。会议参加者坚信，西德复仇主义者的计划不可能得到，而且一定得不到德意志联邦共和国渴望和平的居民的支持。与会者确信，西德居民应得到更好的命运，而不应成为和平破坏者手中的工具。德国人的统治者的贪婪的帝国主义政策过去已经不止一次地使德国人成为他们手中的工具，德国人民因此而不止一次地付出了惨重的代价。
    缔结和约，放弃复仇和修改疆界的一切念头，放弃德国重新军国主义化和原子武装的政策，这就是保证欧洲所有国家人民的安全和德国人民和平未来的最好道路。德意志民主共和国一贯主张走这条道路。如果德意志联邦共和国也能走上这条道路，那将是它对加强和平和促进全面彻底裁军事业的最令人信服的贡献。德意志联邦共和国政府拒绝缔结和约的建议，是因为它不想在变西柏林为自由城市的基础上来解决西柏林问题。它居然要求：把位于德意志民主共和国境内的西柏林归并于西德，如果办不到这点，它就想在那里保留占领制度，以便利用西柏林作为不安和军事危险的策源地。 德意志联邦共和国政府是对德媾和的敌人，因为它不愿意通过两个德国的谈判和缔结和约的道路来和平解决德国统一问题。它不顾常识，不愿看到：选择了不同发展道路的两个德国已经存在十年多了。德意志联邦共和国政府不愿考虑德国人民的根本利益，拒绝德意志民主共和国政府向它多次建议的、通过跟德意志民主共和国谈判的方法来统一国家这条唯一可能的道路。这样，德意志联邦共和国政府就表现了它对德国统一事业的敌视态度。
    德意志联邦共和国政府不愿意听到和约，因为它唯恐和约的缔结会消除在西德已经形成的局面，在这种局面下，人们仅仅因为他们敢于捍卫自己的进步信念、敢于维护德国人民的民族权利与和平的利益便受到审判。德意志联邦共和国政府的全部行动说明，它正在一步步地为在西德建立这样一个政权而扫清道路，这个政权将要造成一个民主的假象，而实质上却是接近于曾经把世界推入流血战争、把德国人民引向空前的民族灾难的那个政权。否则，法西斯分子怎么能够在西德发动如此卑鄙无耻的纳粹式的反犹挑衅呢？这种进攻是全世界近来所目睹的。德意志联邦共和国政府厚颜无耻地袒护这种卑鄙活动的策划者，而德意志联邦共和国的某些官方人士竟采取希特勒分子的惯用手法，挑拨性地企图嫁祸于共产党人。
    这一切只能加深各国人民对德意志联邦共和国政策的不信任。在这种情况下，进行更积极的斗争来争取缔结对德和约就成为必要的了。
    有代表参加这次会议的国家都主张同一切国家，其中包括同德意志联邦共和国，建立和平合作和睦邻关系，并且不惜一切力量在实际上来争取建立这种合作。
    华沙条约缔约国希望同参加对德战争的其他同盟国和联盟国一道达成对德媾和。这意味着缔结对德和约；这个和约在目前情况下可由两个德国签字。但是它们不能同意把这些问题的解决无休止地拖延下去，因为这只能鼓励西德的军国主义和复仇主义势力。
    如果在同两个德国缔结和约方面的努力得不到支持，如果这个问题的解决遭到拖延，那么这次会议的参加国没有别的办法，只有跟其他愿意同德意志民主共和国缔结和约的国家一道，同德意志民主共和国缔结和约，并在这一基础上解决西柏林问题。
    有代表参加这次会议的国家重申，它们始终不渝地致力于改善东西方国家之间的关系，加强东西方国家之间的信任和发展国际合作的各种形式。它们同过去一样，主张无阻碍地发展国际贸易、加强国家活动家、社会活动家和社会团体的接触，主张进行能使各国人民增添财富的文化、科学和技术成就的交流。
    停止战争宣传、停止挑衅性的叫嚣、停止以采用实力相威胁的企图，对于国际局势的健康化和国与国关系中的怀疑态度的消除具有重大的意义。
    至于华沙条约缔约国，则战争宣传在这些国家是被法律禁止的，这些国家准备采取进一步的措施，使国与国关系中彼此戒备和尖锐的争论气氛让位给善意和信任。
    在国际紧张局势显著缓和的情况下，关于两个国家集团——华沙条约组织和北大西洋公约组织之间缔结互不侵犯公约的建议比往年具有更为重大的意义，这个建议到目前为止尚未得到积极的解决。与会者坚信，北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约组织之间缔结互不侵犯公约这件事的迫切性不但没有减弱，而且年复一年地增加。因此与会者认为有必要声明，这个建议仍然有效，它们准备在任何时候同北大西洋公约组织成员国签订互不侵犯公约。
    属于不同军事集团的国家签订双边互不侵犯条约，以及在欧洲建立无原子武器和火箭武器地区，也将会对改善国际局势起不小的作用。
    与会者非常满意地欢迎苏联、美国、英国和法国已就今年5月在巴黎召开最高级会议一事达成的协议。华沙条约缔约国政府早就在争取召开这种会议，正像它们在1958年5月24日的宣言中所指出的那样，它们认为最高级会议“在目前的条件下是使人类免于战争灾难和使国际局势转而向着巩固和平的方向发展的一个极其重要的手段”。
    华沙条约缔约国认为，在即将举行的政府首脑会议上，应当讨论像全面彻底裁军问题、对德和约问题（其中包括建立西柏林自由城市的问题）、禁止试验原子武器和氢武器问题和东西方的关系问题等这样一些最重大的和已经成熟了的问题。与会国坚信，只要合理地照顾到各方的利益和共同致力于和平，任何国际争端，无论它多么复杂，都可以得到解决，因此它们希望政府首脑们能够找到走向顺利解决上述问题的正确道路，以利于巩固普遍和平，并希望即将举行的最高级会议能成为东西方国家之间的关系的转折点。
    华沙条约缔约国认为，目前，在东西方国家领导人之间举行重要会谈的前夕，在召开最高级会议的前夕，特别重要的是，各国尽一切努力创造有助于使即将举行的会谈获得圆满结果的环境。参加会议各国声明，他们将在这方面努力，并且号召其他所有国家促进东西方之间的会谈成功，放弃可能使会谈复杂化的任何步骤。
    华沙条约缔约国政府满意地确认，它们为了停止军备竞赛、消除国际冲突危险策源地和消除“冷战”而进行的不懈努力，得到了世界各国人民越来越广泛的支持，并且得到积极的成果。它们一致认为，在我们这个时代，各国没有，也不可能有比促进保障世界持久和平更加伟大和更加崇高的任务了。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国代表：
