According to the Shanxi Daily, the technological innovation and technical revolution movement on the industrial front in the Jinnan region is surging forward at high speed. Since the Jinnan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) held an on-site conference on technological innovation in Xinzhang Town, Houma City, on December 19th last year, launching a campaign to advance towards mechanization and semi-mechanization, the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the region's 357 county-run factories and mines has soared from about 30% to 76% by February 7th, saving more than 27,000 workers in just fifty days.

The county-run industries in the Jinnan region mostly developed during the mass campaign to run industries by the whole people since 1958. Over the past two years, these enterprises have played a significant role in developing the rural economy, especially in supporting agricultural production and technological transformation. However, due to low technological levels, more than 70% of the production processes relied on heavy manual labor, resulting in high labor demands and inability to meet the requirements of agricultural technological transformation. To fundamentally change this backward situation, the CPC Jinnan Prefectural Committee, in December of last year, put forward the demand to all workers in the region to "oppose cowardice, promote revolutionary vigor, have everyone use their hands and brains, and achieve mechanization at high speed;" and led by Li Xuemin, Secretary of the Prefectural Committee Secretariat, launched a vigorous technological innovation and technical revolution movement among all workers in the region. During the technological innovation movement, Party committees at all levels in the region earnestly strengthened leadership, vigorously mobilized the masses in various forms, and promoted the advanced experiences that emerged in the movement. The Prefectural Committee held ten meetings, fifteen telephone conferences, and two large-scale on-site conferences, promptly disseminating experiences from the movement and resolving practical problems. More than 20,000 workers from county-run factories and mines also organized visits and study sessions to Xinzhang Town and Yicheng County, which were at the forefront of technological innovation and technical revolution.

The region widely and deeply carried out communist cooperation, supporting and coordinating with each other, greatly accelerating the progress of the movement. They coordinated a total of 2,082 horsepower of power machinery, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient power. When there was not enough foreign machinery, they organized workers from various enterprises to manufacture indigenous machinery through collaborative methods. In just fifty days, they created and imitated 1,519 kinds and 43,000 pieces of indigenous machinery, increasing labor efficiency by ten to eighty times respectively. When some major technical difficulties were not easy to break through, they sought advice from experts everywhere and conducted joint research. The Leather Factory in Xinzhang Town, Houma City, could not break through the mechanization of shoe polishing, so they researched and came up with solutions together with the Yicheng County Leather Factory; a few days later, Wang Juncai, a worker at the Yicheng Leather Factory, created a wooden polishing machine and immediately called the Xinzhang Leather Factory, quickly increasing shoe polishing efficiency by more than twenty times. When there was a shortage of raw materials for manufacturing new machinery, industry and agriculture, and industry and commerce organized coordination and mutual exchange.

    县营工业革新技术的急先锋
    晋南各县营厂矿五十天基本实现机械化半机械化
    土机械提高生产效率十到八十倍全区节约劳动力两万七千多
    据山西日报消息　晋南区工业战线上的技术革新和技术革命运动汹涌澎湃，高速度前进。从去年12月19日中共晋南地委在侯马市新绛镇召开技术革新现场会议，发起向机械化和半机械化进军的运动以后，到本月7日为止的短短五十天中，全区三百五十七个县营厂矿的机械化、半机械化水平，就由原来的30％左右猛增到76％，节约劳动力两万七千余人。
    晋南地区的县营工业，大部分是在1958年以来全民大办工业的运动中发展起来的。两年来，这批企业在发展农村经济，特别是在支援农业生产和农业技术改造方面发挥了巨大的作用。但是，由于技术水平低，70％以上的生产过程采用笨重的手工劳动，因此用人很多，还不能适应农业技术改造的要求。为了从根本上改变这种落后面貌，中共晋南地委在去年12月份，就向全区广大职工提出了“反对懦夫思想，大鼓革命干劲，人人动手动脑，高速度实现机械化”的要求；并由地委书记处书记李学敏同志挂帅，发动全区职工展开了轰轰烈烈的技术革新和技术革命运动。在技术革新运动中，全区各级党委认真加强了领导，用各种各样的形式，大力发动群众，推广运动中出现的先进经验。地委曾先后开过十次会议，十五次电话会议，两次大型的现场会议，及时地传播运动中的经验，解决实际问题。各县营厂矿还先后组织了二万多名职工，到技术革新和技术革命运动走在前头的新绛镇和翼城县参观和学习。
    全区广泛深入地开展了共产主义的大协作，相互支援，相互调剂，大大加速了运动的进展。他们共调剂了总动力达二千零八十二马力的动力机械，克服了动力不足的困难。洋机械不够用，他们就组织各企业职工用协作的办法制造土机械。在短短的五十天中，创制和仿制出的土机械有一千五百一十九种，四万三千件，使劳动效率分别提高十倍至八十倍。有些重大的技术难关不容易突破，他们就到处投师访友，共同研究。侯马市新绛镇皮革厂突不破皮鞋上光机械化的关，就和翼城县皮革厂一起研究、想办法；过了几天，翼城皮革厂工人王俊才创造出了木制上光机，立刻打电话告诉新绛皮革厂，很快使皮鞋的上光效率提高了二十多倍。制造新机械原材料不足时，工业和农业、工业和商业之间就组织调剂互换。
