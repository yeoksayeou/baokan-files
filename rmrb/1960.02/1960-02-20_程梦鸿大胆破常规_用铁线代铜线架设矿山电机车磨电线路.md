Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 18th. Cheng Menghong, an engineer at the Anshan Black Metal Mine Design Institute, with the strong support of relevant departments and factories, successfully tested the use of iron wire instead of copper wire to build mine electric locomotive trolley lines. The success of this innovation broke the convention that electric locomotive trolley lines must use copper wire and reduced the investment in developing new mines.

Copper is a non-ferrous metal essential to many industrial sectors. Building a medium-sized iron mine requires more than ten tons of copper wire for the trolley lines alone. Cheng Menghong, a member of the Communist Youth League, always thought when designing trolley lines: if there was a way to build trolley lines without copper wire, wouldn't it save the country a lot of copper and construction investment? After a long period of deliberation, he boldly proposed the suggestion of using iron wire instead of copper wire.

Cheng Menghong's innovative proposal received strong support from the Party committee of the design institute and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. It was decided to conduct the experiment at the Longyan Iron and Steel Company. During the experiment, Cheng Menghong and the experimental group he led, with the strong support of relevant factories and mines, overcame numerous difficulties. When there was no suitable iron wire available, the workers of the Tianjin Third Steel Rolling Plant specially trial-rolled iron wire of this specification for them; later, it was discovered that iron wire had poor conductivity and high "resistance," which often caused the electric locomotive to overheat. They came up with the idea of erecting auxiliary aluminum wires to strengthen the conductivity of the iron wires and reduce "resistance." After half a month of testing, it was proven that iron wire and auxiliary aluminum wire could completely replace copper wire for erecting trolley lines.

If the volume of transportation is small, it is also possible to use only iron wire without aluminum wire assistance. The design institute has already applied this experimental result to mine design. Since the beginning of this year, the Xin'da Iron Mine in Hebei Province, the Wuyang Iron Mine in Henan Province, and the Banshigou Iron Mine in Liaoning, and four other iron mines that they have designed, all use iron wire and aluminum wire instead of copper wire for erecting trolley lines. Erecting just the 110 kilometers of power supply lines for these seven iron mines can save the country 50 tons of copper wire, save 220,000 yuan in construction investment, and allow construction to proceed ahead of schedule without being restricted by the supply of copper wire.

### 程梦鸿大胆破常规  用铁线代铜线架设矿山电机车磨电线路

    程梦鸿大胆破常规
    用铁线代铜线架设矿山电机车磨电线路
    据新华社鞍山18日电　鞍山黑色金属矿山设计院工程师程梦鸿在有关部门和厂矿的大力支援下，试验成功用铁线代替铜线架设矿山电机车磨电线路。这一革新的试验成功，打破了电机车磨电线路必须用铜线的常规，降低了开发新矿山的投资。
    铜是许多工业部门必需的有色金属。建设一个中型铁矿山，只是架设磨电线路一项，就需要十来吨铜线。共青团员程梦鸿，每次设计磨电线路时都想：如果能有一个办法，架设磨电线路不用铜线，不是可以给国家节省许多铜和建设投资么？他经过长期的琢磨，最后大胆地提出了用铁线代替铜线的建议。
    程梦鸿的革新建议，得到这个设计院党委、冶金工业部的大力支持。决定在龙烟钢铁公司进行试验。在试验过程中，程梦鸿和他领导的试验小组，在有关厂矿的大力支援下，战胜重重困难。没有适合需要的铁线，天津第三轧钢厂的职工，专门给他们试轧了这种规格的铁线；后来发现铁线导电能力差、“电阻”大，常常使电机车发热，他们想出用架设辅助铝线的办法，加强了铁线的导电能力，减小了“电阻”。前后经过半个月的试验，证明完全可以用铁线、辅助铝线代替铜线，架设磨电线路。
    如果运输量小的话，还可以只用铁线，而不用铝线辅助。这个设计院已经把这一试验成果，应用到矿山设计上去。今年以来，他们设计的河北省辛大铁矿、河南省舞阳铁矿、辽宁的板石沟铁矿等七个铁矿，都是用铁线和铝线代替铜线，架设磨电线路。仅架设这七个铁矿的一百一十公里供电线路，就可以给国家节省五十吨铜线，节约建设投资二十二万元，并且可以不受铜线供应的限制，提前施工。
