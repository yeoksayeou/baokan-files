    The First Branch of the East Wind
    Yang Shuo

    It is precisely the first spring of the 1960s. At the beginning of spring, the east wind blows, melting ice and snow, immediately about to unfold a scene of willow green and flower red spring scenery. The previously rampant north wind and cold snow can no longer show off their might, and watch helplessly as they lose their foothold. This is the time when the east wind prevails over the west wind.

    What is the first flower blown open by the east wind? Winter jasmine blooms early, and narcissus is not late either. But neither can compare to that most beautiful and fragrant fresh flower—this is the flower of friendship blooming from the hearts of the Chinese and Soviet people.

    It was not long ago that fireworks celebrating the tenth anniversary of our founding were flying all over the sky, and now we immediately celebrate the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. Ten years ago, when spring first descended on the history of new China, the east wind first blew open this flower of friendship.

    For ten years, on the vast and boundless Sino-Soviet territory, in the hearts of 850 million Chinese and Soviet people, where has this vibrant flower not bloomed?

    From the Heilongjiang to the Pearl River, from the East China Sea to the snow-capped Kunlun Mountains, whether it is the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, high mountains, plains, or the vast Gobi Desert, everywhere you can see the large-scale industries built with Soviet assistance, and everywhere you can meet enthusiastic Soviet comrades. These many Soviet comrades went deep into the most difficult places in our motherland, dripping with sweat, braving rain, snow, wind, and frost, and together with our people, conquered the desert, conquered the Yellow River, built magnificent steelmaking furnaces, and mined the minerals that had been sleeping underground for millions of years. They embraced such a selfless spirit, as if they were building their own motherland. If you say any words of thanks to them, they will say: "Sorry, you are wrong. Whether it is in the Ural Mountains or the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River, we hold the same ideal, we are building a great common cause, why should we distinguish between each other?"

    It is precisely because the Chinese and Soviet people have such a common ideal and common struggle that the two countries are united as one. And on the firm foundation of this great alliance, not only has a very beautiful flower of friendship been opened, but also a flower of peace that influences the future of mankind.

    In the extremely distant ancient times, mountain-building movements once occurred on the earth. After human life entered the twentieth century, earth-shattering mountain-building movements also appeared in history. At the beginning of this century, wasn't the Soviet Union an unprecedented historical peak, standing upright? At the end of the 1940s, another new peak was formed, and that was the People's China. These two historical peaks are closely linked into one, becoming an indestructible fortress, head-on blocking the road of aggression that war criminals repeatedly wanted to advance. I still remember in late 1958, I went to Ghana to attend the first All-African People's Conference. Many African representatives gathered together and enthusiastically discussed the issue of African independence and freedom. One early morning, I went for a walk in the garden with a friend from Senegal and found a purple rose with two flowers on one stem.

    I said: "Look, this just symbolizes Asia and Africa."

    That friend smiled slightly and said: "No, I think one flower of this double-flowered rose is China, and the other is the Soviet Union, which just symbolizes freedom, happiness, and peace. Do you understand?"

    Of course I understood, because he had expressed to me more than once: only China and the Soviet Union are the most reliable friends of the African people in their struggle for independence and freedom; only Sino-Soviet unity can most effectively guarantee lasting peace in the world.

    It is no wonder that imperialism always regards China and the Soviet Union as thorns in their side, and painstakingly attempts to sow discord between the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union and destroy world peace. They sometimes clamor for war, and sometimes dress up as angels, talking about peace. The so-called "Security Treaty" newly concluded between Japan and the United States not long ago is one of the imperialist conspiracies to prepare for an anti-Soviet and anti-China war, seriously threatening peace in Asia. Can these conspiracies succeed?

    China has tens of millions of rivers, and the Soviet Union has more than ten thousand rivers. Although there are many rivers, every river leads to the ocean. When the Chinese and Soviet people are building their own countries, every effort and every achievement may not seem to be closely related, but they ultimately lead to the vast and boundless ocean of socialism and communism. The internationalist friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is as deep and broad as the ocean. Who can draw a ditch in the ocean? Not even a shallow trace can be drawn. No one can draw a single trace on the sea surface, so no one can damage the slightest bit of the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. Li Bai has a poem that says: "Draw a sword to cut water, and the water flows even more." The imperialist conspiracy to separate the great alliance between China and the Soviet Union is just a waste of effort, and the result will inevitably be like Li Bai's next line of poetry: "Raise a cup to dispel sorrow, but sorrow only increases," ending up falling into the abyss of pessimism and despair.

    Since the Sino-Soviet alliance is two high mountains standing side by side in human history, forming a solid fortress for the cause of peace in the world, then who can push down these two mountains? Even shaking them is a foolish dream. There is an old Chinese saying: "An ant trying to shake a big tree is ridiculous and overestimates its own strength." Even a big tree cannot be shaken, let alone a big mountain. With such peaceful mountains as a guarantee, and with the existence of a strong socialist camp, plus the unity of peace-loving countries and people all over the world, if war maniacs dare to act rashly and launch a war, the result will inevitably be crushed under the mountains, resulting in shattered bones.

    I have flown back and forth between Beijing and Moscow many times. When flying from Beijing to Moscow, it gets dark halfway through the flight, but flying further west, the sky gradually becomes brighter again, and when I arrive in Moscow, the whole city is still bathed in sunlight. When flying from Moscow to Beijing, I depart in the middle of the night, and soon after flying, a bright red rising sun rises in the east. Beijing and Moscow are five hours apart, so naturally it will be like this. But every time I see this scene, I always have a particularly fresh feeling: between these two great countries, the light is forever shining.

    Now it is early spring, and the east wind is blowing fiercely. But the cold winter is unwilling to surrender easily and continues to counterattack against spring. But this counterattack is destined to fail. We firmly believe that one day, the east wind will be mighty and will surely blow open brilliant and dazzling flowers of peace and friendship all over the earth.

    东风第一枝
    杨朔
    正是二十世纪六十年代的头一个春天。一开春，东风吹起来，吹得冰化雪消，立刻就要展开一片柳绿花红的春光。曾经狂暴一时的朔风寒雪再也逞不得威风，眼看着失去立脚的阵地。这是东风压倒西风的时节。
    东风吹开的第一枝花是什么花呢？迎春花开的早，水仙花也不迟。可是都比不得那枝最美最香的鲜花——这就是从中苏人民心坎里开出来的友谊之花。
    才是不久，庆祝我们建国十周年的焰火满天飞舞着，现在紧接着又庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订十周年。十年以前，当春天第一次降临到新中国的历史上时，东风便首先吹开了这枝友谊之花。
    十年来，在那广阔无边的中苏国土上，在八亿五千万中苏人民的心口上，哪儿不开遍这种浓艳的花朵？
    从黑龙江到珠江，从东海到满头白雪的昆仑山，不管是长江大河，高山平原，或者是黄沙漠漠的大戈壁，处处都可以看见苏联帮助我们建设起来的大工业，处处都可以遇见热情洋溢的苏联同志。这许多苏联同志深入到我们祖国最艰苦的地方，滴着汗珠，冒着雨雪风霜，跟我们的人民一起，征服沙漠，战胜黄河，修起规模宏伟的炼钢炉，采掘出睡在地下千千万万年的矿藏。他们抱着那样的忘我精神，就好像建设他们自己的祖国一样。你如果向他们说什么道谢的话，他们会说：“对不起，你错了。无论是在乌拉尔山，还是在长江三峡，我们抱的是一个理想，我们建设的是一个伟大的共同的事业，为什么还要分彼此呢？”
    正是由于中苏人民有着这样共同的理想，共同的斗争，中苏两国才会团结得像一个人似的。而在这种伟大同盟的牢固基础上，不但开放出十分艳丽的友谊之花，还开放出影响着人类未来的和平之花。
    在极远极远的太古时期，地球上曾经发生过造山运动。人类生活进入二十世纪后，历史上也出现了翻天覆地的造山运动。本世纪初，苏联不就是一座空前未有的历史高峰，劈面立起？到四十年代末尾，又一座新的高峰形成了，这就是人民中国。这两座历史的高峰紧连成一体，变成坚不可摧的堡垒，迎头堵住战争罪犯一再想推进的侵略道路。还记得1958年底，我到加纳去参加第一次全非人民大会。许许多多非洲的代表聚集一起，十分热烈地讨论着非洲的独立自由问题。一天清晨，我跟一位塞内加尔的朋友到花园里去散步，发现一枝并蒂开着的紫玫瑰花。
    我说：“看哪，这恰好象征着亚洲和非洲。”
    那位朋友却微微一笑说：“不，我觉得这枝并蒂花一朵是中国，一朵是苏联，恰好象征着自由、幸福、和平。你懂得么？”
    我当然懂得，因为他曾经不止一次地向我表示：只有中国和苏联，才是非洲人民争取独立自由的最可靠的朋友；只有中苏团结，才能最有效地保障全世界的持久和平。
    这就难怪帝国主义总是把中苏两国看成眼中钉，处心积虑地妄想离间中苏的伟大友情，摧毁世界和平。他们一会儿叫嚣战争，一会儿又装扮成安琪儿的姿态，高谈和平。不久前日美新缔结的所谓“安全条约”正是帝国主义准备进行反苏反华战争的阴谋措施之一，严重地威胁着亚洲的和平。难道这种种阴谋能够得逞么？
    中国有千万条河，苏联的河流也何止万千。河流虽多，条条河流却都通向海洋。中苏人民在建设自己的祖国时，每一分劳力，每一项成就，乍看起来不一定都紧相关联，最终却都通向那浩渺无边的社会主义和共产主义的海洋。中苏两国人民的国际主义友情也就像海洋一样深，一样广。有谁能在海洋上划一道沟么？就是一条浅浅的痕迹也划不上。没有人能在海面上划一丁点痕迹，也就没有人能损伤一丝一毫中苏人民水乳交融的友情。李白有句诗说：“抽刀断水水更流”。帝国主义妄想分离中苏伟大同盟的阴谋只是枉费心机，结果呢，也必然会像李白的下一句诗：“举杯消愁愁更愁”，落得陷进悲观绝望的深渊而已。
    中苏同盟既然是人类历史上两座并肩而立的高山，形成全世界和平事业的巩固堡垒，那么，有谁能推倒这两座大山么？就是摇一摇也是痴心梦想。中国有句古语说：“蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量。”大树都摇不动，何况是大山。有这样的和平大山做保障，更有强大的社会主义阵营的存在，再加上全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的团结一致，如果战争狂人胆敢轻举妄动，发动战争，结果必然会被压在大山底下，弄得粉身碎骨。
    我曾经多次在北京和莫斯科之间来往飞行。从北京往莫斯科飞时，飞到中途天就暗下来，再往西飞，天空却又渐渐透出亮光，赶到莫斯科，满城还有阳光。从莫斯科往北京飞时，半夜出发，刚飞不久，东方就升起一轮鲜红的朝阳。北京和莫斯科的时间相差五小时，自然会如此。但我每次看见这种景象，总有一种特别新鲜的感觉：在这两个伟大的国家之间，光明是永远照耀着的。
    现在正当初春，东风吹得正猛。寒冬却不肯轻易投降，还要不断地向春天反扑。但这反扑是注定要失败的。我们深信总有一天，东风浩荡，一定会在整个地球上吹开灿烂耀眼的和平与友谊之花。
