	A Versatile Department Store
	The No. 1 Store in Daoli District, Harbin, is known as a "versatile store" because it handles a wide variety of goods and offers many services. Such versatile stores are developing in Harbin. In addition to selling goods, the No. 1 Store in Daoli District offers many services for customers. If you want to buy a large mirror as a gift, the store can engrave it for you; if you want to print team names or factory names on sportswear, the store can take care of it; after buying ice skates, the salespersons will install the blades for you; if you need especially large or small shoes or hats, you can order them. You can also buy newspapers and stamps at this store. If young women buy sweaters, the store can embroider them in the style they specify.
	Harbin's commercial departments are advocating giving customers the greatest possible convenience, and salespersons are working hard to learn to repair whatever they sell. In the department store under the Pingfang District Commercial Bureau, customers can have their faded old leather shoes dyed and oiled. Shirts, jerseys, and sweaters with worn collars and cuffs can be sent to the store for renovation.
	A Hotel More Convenient Than Home
	Most people would think that hotels are just places to stay for a few days, so how can you expect them to be as convenient as home? But customers staying at the Hengfa Hotel in Harbin feel that it is even more convenient than being at home. Guests who love skating can rent ice skates at the hotel. If the weather suddenly changes, the hotel also has rental cotton clothes, cotton shoes, and rain gear. The hotel not only sells train and boat tickets, but also has bicycles for rent. The hotel has a dining hall and a small store, launders clothes for guests, and even organizes parties for guests on weekends.
	A traveler named Yang Xiaofeng from Shandong Province fell seriously ill while staying at this hotel. After the service staff took him to the hospital, they often went to the hospital to take care of him until he recovered and was discharged.
	Thoughtful Barber Shop
	The barbers at the Red Star Barber Shop have made friends with many customers. In the months since they started offering multiple services, they have received more than a thousand letters of commendation from customers. One female customer wrote in her letter of commendation: "In the past, I always wanted to get a perm, but I could never get one because I have a nursing child. I couldn't get a perm while holding the child, and I was afraid that the child would wake up and want to nurse if I left her at home. Thank you for providing a crib in your shop, so that women like me with children can also get perms."
	For people who cannot come to the shop for a haircut, the barber shop provides door-to-door service by appointment. The barber shop also sells cigarettes, magazines, envelopes, stationery, and pencils. Customers can use the time while waiting for a haircut to read and write letters. Customers are not only convenient and satisfied with this, but also praise them for their thoughtful service.
	Restaurant That Doubles as a Community Kitchen
	Whenever a holiday approaches, the restaurants under the Taiping District Service Station in Harbin send a group of skilled chefs to factories and enterprises to help and guide the cooks there in making delicious meals for the workers to celebrate the holiday. All the restaurants in this district, while providing meals to customers, have opened a service project for processing staple and non-staple foods for the public. If customers have urgent matters to attend to and do not have time to cook at home, they can bring flour to the restaurant to exchange for steamed buns or baked cakes. The restaurant can also process meals according to customers' specific requirements. In this way, a large family can eat a delicious meal, but it costs less than eating out at a restaurant.

    服务行业万紫千红	万能百货店
    哈尔滨道里区第一商店，因为经营品种多，服务项目广，被人们称为万能商店。这样的万能商店在哈尔滨市正在发展起来。道里区第一商店在出售商品以外，开展了许多项为顾客服务的工作。要买大镜子作礼品，商店可以代为刻字；运动服要印队名、厂名，商店负责代印；买好了冰刀、冰鞋，营业员就代把冰刀上好；如果需要特别大或特别小的鞋子、帽子，可以订做。需要报纸、邮票，也可以在这个商店里买到。姑娘们买了毛衣，商店可以按她们指定的样式绣花。
    哈尔滨商业部门正在提倡把最大的方便送给顾客，营业员们都在努力学习卖什么就会修理什么。在平房区商业局所属的百货商店里，可以代顾客给落色的旧皮鞋上色、打油。磨坏了衣领、袖口的衬衣、球衣、毛衣都可以送到商店里翻新。	  比家还方便的旅馆
    一般人都会认为旅馆本来是暂时住几天的地方，哪能要求它像在家那样方便。可是住在哈尔滨恒发旅馆的顾客们都感到比在自己家里还要方便。爱滑冰的旅客在旅馆里能租到冰刀、冰鞋。要是天气突然变化，旅馆里还有出租的棉衣、棉鞋、防雨用具。旅馆不但代买车、船票，还有供出租的自行车。旅馆里有食堂，有小商店，代顾客浆洗衣裳，每到周末还为旅客组织联欢晚会。
    曾有一个山东省来的旅客杨晓峰，住在这个旅馆里忽然生了重病。服务员把他送到医院去以后，还经常到医院里去照顾他，一直到他病愈出院。	    周到的理发店
    红星理发馆的理发员和很多顾客交上了朋友，在他们开展多项服务以来的几个月中，已经收到了一千多封顾客的表扬信。一个女顾客的表扬信说：“过去我想烫发，总也烫不成，因为我有吃奶的孩子。抱着孩子，没法烫发，放在家里又怕孩子醒了要吃奶。谢谢你们店里准备了小儿床，让我这个带孩子的妇女，也能烫上发了。”
    这个理发店对不能来店理发的人，通过预约，理发员登门服务。理发店里还代售纸烟、杂志、信封、信纸、铅笔。顾客可以利用等候理发的时间看书、写信。对此，顾客不仅方便、满意，还赞扬他们服务周到。	  兼做群众厨房的饭馆
    每当节日前夕，哈尔滨市太平区服务站所属的饭馆，就抽出一批手艺高巧的厨师到工厂、企业里去，帮助和指导那里的炊事员做出口味佳美的饭菜，供职工欢度佳节。这个区所有的饭馆，在供应顾客饭菜同时，开办了主、副食品对外加工的服务项目。如果顾客有急事要办，家里来不及做饭，可以拿面粉到饭馆里换馒头或是烧饼。饭馆还可以按顾客特定的要求加工饭菜。这样，一大家人吃一顿口味很好的饭菜，花钱却比下馆子要经济的多。
