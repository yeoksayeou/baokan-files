This newspaper Hangzhou, February 4th dispatch: Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province, has systematically innovated spring ploughing preparation and spring ploughing production tools, finalizing and comprehensively promoting thirteen sets of new-style tools, totaling eighty-four types, for manure accumulation, manure transportation, plowing, transplanting, and sericulture. This has greatly improved the labor efficiency of various agricultural tasks, making this year's preparatory work earlier, faster, and better.

After the systematic innovation and promotion of production tools, the progress of spring ploughing preparation in Jiaxing County has greatly accelerated. In early January, the average daily manure accumulation per person was 54 dan, which increased to more than 70 dan by mid-January. The water management work efficiency in the county also increased from 4 cubic meters to 9.6 cubic meters. By the end of January, the county had prepared more than 50 million dan of base fertilizer for 730,000 mu of early rice fields, averaging 70 dan of standard fertilizer per mu. The winter-spring water management plan was completed more than ten days ahead of schedule. The first spring plowing of more than 85,000 mu of winter fallow fields was completed one month earlier than last year, and more than 70,000 mu of seedling fields have been selected and are being comprehensively plowed. At the same time, more than 3 million labor days were saved from the water and fertilizer fronts and invested in other preparatory work.

Jiaxing County has more land and less labor, with an average of 7.7 mu of land per laborer. In order to strive for continued leap forward in agricultural production, this year's production scale is larger and the standards are higher. Therefore, the total rural labor demand for the year will increase by 51.26 million workdays, accounting for 64% of last year's actual labor use, making the labor issue very tight. After field investigations and research, the Jiaxing County Party Committee found that the main way to solve this year's labor problem is to vigorously carry out technological innovation, especially systematic tool innovation. For example, at the Zhenru water management construction site of the No. 6 Bridge Production Team in Nanhui Commune, only soil transport vehicles were used at the beginning of construction, while digging, soil extraction, and soil compaction still used old-fashioned tools, and the daily work efficiency per person was only about 3 cubic meters. Later, with the systematic use of new tools, the work efficiency rapidly increased to more than 12 cubic meters. This team originally only used manure accumulation boats for accumulating and transporting manure, which led to the disconnection between accumulating river mud waiting for loading and loading river mud waiting for transportation. Later, the team created cow-drawn mud-dragging boats, and opened river mud self-flow channels for each field, and installed more than 300 meters of wooden tracks, realizing the systematic innovation of manure accumulation and transportation tools, and the daily manure accumulation per person increased from the original 40 dan to 100 dan. After the rapid promotion of the systematic new tools for manure accumulation, the entire commune created and imitated more than 2,000 new types of manure transport vehicles, net-style fertilizer hoisting devices, single-pole fertilizer lifting devices, single-rail wheelbarrows, and cow-drawn double-rail fertilizer transport devices, etc., in four days, increasing the daily manure accumulation progress of the entire commune from 380,000 dan to more than 770,000 dan.

The Jiaxing County Party Committee seized this advanced example of the Nanhui Commune, successively held three on-site meetings, organized more than 2,000 people to visit, and launched a mass movement for systematic tool innovation throughout the county, and organized a bottom-up mass evaluation of systematic tools. The county finalized more than 500 types of systematic advanced tools reported by various communes through comparing work efficiency, quality, ease of operation, and comprehensive utilization. For example, eight effective new-style tools created by commune members from Huimin, Nanhui, Nanhui, and Wangdian communes, such as river mud dredging boats, double-person no-boat manure accumulation devices, animal-powered fertilizer suction vehicles, wooden field fertilizer delivery vehicles, river mud self-flow channels, river mud scrapers, and single-rail and double-rail fertilizer application vehicles, were combined to use improved tools for all four processes of manure accumulation, manure loading, manure transportation, and manure application. After the promotion of this set of new-style tools in the county in mid-January, it was well received by the masses in various places, and more than 2,700 sets were promoted in just over half a month.

The systematic reform of preparatory tools has greatly increased the task of manufacturing and repairing new-style tools. In order to solve this problem, in addition to transferring manpower and equipment to strengthen the county's farm tool factories and farm tool repair stations, the county party committee implemented a three-level farm tool factory system at the county, commune, and team levels, manufacturing and repairing tools according to the complexity of the tool structure, so that the systematic reform of preparatory tools could advance at high speed. For example, after implementing hierarchical manufacturing in Dongzha Commune, in just one month, the commune's nine farm tool factories closely cooperated with commune members to self-manufacture more than 1,200 sets of manure accumulation, transportation, animal husbandry, sericulture and other aspects of more than 10,000 new tools, equivalent to two-thirds of the total number of tools self-manufactured by the entire commune in the past six months. In more than a month, the county has realized the new-style toolization of accumulation, loading, transportation, and application in manure accumulation; and new tools have been used in sets in the links of sowing and transplanting in sowing, and ploughing, harrowing, and raking in cultivation.

### 嘉兴春耕工具成套革新  积肥、上肥、运肥、施肥四道工序全部使用改良工具  播种、插秧、耕作几个环节的新工具都配成了套

    嘉兴春耕工具成套革新
    积肥、上肥、运肥、施肥四道工序全部使用改良工具
    播种、插秧、耕作几个环节的新工具都配成了套
    本报杭州4日电　浙江省嘉兴县成套地革新备耕和春耕生产工具，已定型和全面推广了积肥、运肥、耕田、插秧和蚕桑等新式工具十三套共八十四种，大大提高了各项农活的劳动效率，使今年的备耕工作做得又早又快又好。
    成套地革新和推广生产工具以后，嘉兴县备耕进度大大加快。1月上旬，全县平均每人每日积肥五十四担，到了中旬，就提高到七十担以上。全县治水工效也从四方提高到九点六方。到1月底止，全县已为七十三万亩早稻田准备了基肥五千多万担，每亩平均七十担标准肥；去冬今春的治水计划已经提前十多天完成；八万五千多亩冬闲田已比去年提前一个月完成第一遍春翻；七万多亩秧田已经全部选定，并且正在全面翻耕。同时从水肥战线节省出三百多万个劳动日，投入其他备耕工作。
    嘉兴县土地多、劳力少，平均每个劳力负担七点七亩田。为了争取农业生产继续跃进，今年的生产规模更大，标准更高。因此，全年农村需工量比去年要增加五千一百二十六万工，占去年实际用工数的64％，劳力问题很紧张。经过实地调查研究，嘉兴县委发现要解决今年的劳动力问题，主要的出路就是大搞技术革新，特别是成套地革新工具。例如南湖公社六号桥生产队的真如治水工地，开始施工时只有运土用车子，而挖土、取土、夯土仍旧用旧式工具，每人日工效只有三方左右；后来成套地用上新工具，工效就迅速上升到十二方以上。这个队积肥运肥，原先光用积肥船，发生了积河泥等待上河泥和上河泥等待运河泥的脱节现象；后来制成牛拉拖泥船，同时爿爿田开筑了河泥自流道，安装了三百多米长的木轨道，实现了积肥运肥工具成套革新，每人每日积肥料由原来的四十担增加到一百担。积肥的成套新工具迅速推广以后，全社在四天时间内，创制、仿制了新式运肥车、网鱼式吊肥器、单杆提肥器、单轨独轮车、牛拖双轨运肥器等十余种，共二千多件，使全社积肥日进度由三十八万担增加到七十七万多担。
    嘉兴县委抓住南湖公社这个先进榜样，先后召开了三次现场会议，组织二千余人参观，在全县掀起了成套革新工具的群众运动，并且组织了一次自下而上的群众性的成套工具评选。县里将各公社上报的成套先进工具五百余种，通过比工效、比质量、比操作轻便、比综合利用，进行定型。例如将惠民、南湖、南汇、王店等四个公社社员所创制的罱河泥船、双人无船积肥器、畜力吸肥车、木制田间送肥车、河泥自流道、河泥刮板、单轨和双轨施肥车等八种行之有效的新式工具配成了套，使积肥、上肥、运肥、施肥四道工序全部使用改良工具。1月中旬，这套新式工具在全县推广后，深受各地群众的欢迎，在短短半个多月内就推广了二千七百多套。
    备耕工具成套改革，使新式工具制造和修配的任务大大加重。为了解决这个问题，县委除了抽调人力和设备，充实了全县农具厂和农具修配站的力量以外，并实行县、社、队三级农具厂，按工具结构复杂程度，分级制造、分级修配，使备耕工具成套改革高速度前进。例如东栅公社实行分级制造后，在短短一个月内，全社九个农具厂与社员密切协作，自制成一千二百多套积肥、运肥、畜牧、蚕桑等方面的一万多件新工具，相当于全社过去六个月自制工具总数的三分之二。全县在一个多月的时间里，已在积肥方面实现了积、上、运、施新式工具化；在播种方面的播、插和耕作方面的耕、耖、耙等环节上，都成套地使用了新工具。
