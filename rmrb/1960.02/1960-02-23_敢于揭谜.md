    Daring to Unravel Mysteries
    Yao Renwei
    Under the leadership and education of the Party, the working people can create miracles by giving full play to their spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. Such things are no longer considered "miracles" in our country, in the era of the Great Leap Forward. However, every new event, in addition to once again proving this truth, always has its own characteristics that can give people new inspiration. Nie Shoumao, a young peasant in Shuanggang People's Commune in Boyang County, Jiangxi Province, who had only two years of schooling, used wild plants "Autumn Okra" and Daizi cotton to carry out distant hybridization based on Michurin's theory, and initially cultivated a promising new variety of cotton that is not afraid of insect pests. This creative labor has great significance in scientific research and further enriches the theory of distant hybridization of plants.
    From the specific process of Nie Shoumao's preliminary success in cultivating "insect-resistant cotton," what other characteristics are there besides once again proving that the working masses have unlimited creative genius?
    First, he has an extraordinary ideal. In July 1955, while participating in the elimination of cotton pests in the commune, Nie Shoumao had the extraordinary ideal of cultivating a new species that was not afraid of insect pests. It is called an extraordinary ideal because he did not only think about how many insects to eliminate in the pest elimination work, but had the ideal of cultivating a new cotton species that was not afraid of insect pests in his mind. The precious thing about this bold ideal is that it has a more positive and more revolutionary significance.
    Second, he has the spirit of exploring the truth. Once, Nie Shoumao found a plant beside the cotton field with yellow flowers and leaves and fruits very similar to cotton, growing very luxuriantly. So he had a series of questions: Why is this plant growing in the cotton field with insects, but it has not been eaten by insects like cotton? What kind of flower is this? What is it used for? And so on. Originally, everything seems very ordinary at first glance. If you don't think or ask, you will let it go casually. On the contrary, if you are willing to seriously ask a few more "whys," then you will find a lot of truth in the things that are usually commonplace, and it will become a new thing.
    Third, he has the perseverance to learn lessons from failures. Nie Shoumao's first experiment with distant hybridization of Daizi cotton resulted in two cotton bolls that were successfully formed. But the second experiment failed. So he read materials everywhere, and finally learned from the theory of Michurin's fruit tree hybridization that the cotton bolls of his second hybridization were all in the later stage and had strong genetic conservatism, so there was no variation.
    Fourth, he has a never-satisfied thought. He found that insect-resistant cotton could not eliminate the pests in the cotton fruit, so he continued to study. Last year, he successfully hybridized gourds, pumpkins, and cotton, hoping to obtain a new insect-free and high-yield variety through this new experiment.
    Gorky once wrote in a short article: "There are two kinds of thoughts in the world: one dares to face a lot of mysteries in life and tries to unravel these mysteries; the other thinks that secrets cannot be explained and deifies them because of fear of these secrets." He also said: "The purpose of the former is to go from one truth to the next truth endlessly, and to explore the ultimate truth through all these truths; the purpose of the latter is to find a quiet corner in the constantly moving and eternally shocking world, and to create a set of irrefutable doctrines there, and to bind the spirit of research and criticism with the shackles of religious rules." (Quoted from "Principles of Marxist Philosophy," pages 9 and 10)
    Daring to unravel mysteries! This is the style of Nie Shoumao and all the advanced elements who work hard and create boldly in the technical innovation movement. Mao Zedong Thought and the communist style have this distinct spirit of "daring." All new things are like a mystery before we understand them and master their laws. Only those who dare to unravel the mystery can break it, step into the door of science and technology, and climb to the peak without stopping!

    敢于揭谜
    姚人为
    劳动人民在党的领导和教育下，发挥敢想、敢说、敢干的精神，就能创造出奇迹。这样的事，在我们的国家，在大跃进的时代，已经不算是“奇迹”了。但是，每一个新的事情的发生，除了再一次证明这个真理以外，总还有它的特点，能给人们新的启发。江西波阳县双港人民公社一位只念过两年书的青年农民聂寿茂，根据米丘林学说，利用野生植物“秋葵”和岱字棉进行远缘杂交，初步培育出了一种不怕虫害的有希望的新品种棉花。这一创造性的劳动，在科学研究上有重大意义，进一步充实了植物远缘杂交的理论。
    从聂寿茂培育“抗虫棉”初步成功的具体过程中，除了再一次证明工农群众有无限创造的天才以外，还有些什么特点呢？
    第一，他有不平常的理想。1955年7月，聂寿茂在参加社里消灭棉花害虫中，就产生了培养一种不怕虫害的新种的不平常的理想。所以说它是一种不平常的理想，因为他在灭虫工作中不单是从有多少就消灭它多少这方面着想，而是胸中怀着培养一种不怕虫害的新棉种的理想。这种大胆的理想可贵之处是有着更积极的和更革命的意义。
    第二，他有探索真理的精神。聂寿茂有一次在棉花旁边发现一株开着黄花、叶和果很像棉花的一种植物，长得非常茂盛。于是他便产生了一连串的疑问：为什么这株生长在有虫的棉花地里的植物，却没有像棉花那样被虫吃过？这是什么花？有什么用？等等。本来任何事物，初看起来都觉得平常得很，你如果不想不问，也就随便放过。相反的，你若是肯认真地多问几个“为什么”，那么，平时司空见惯的东西其中也会发现很多道理，就会变成新鲜事物了。
    第三，他有从失败中找出教训的毅力。聂寿茂第一次试验岱字棉远缘杂交，结果圆满地结了两个棉铃。但是第二次试验却失败了。于是他到处翻阅资料，终于从介绍米丘林的有关果树杂交的理论中，知道了他第二次杂交的棉铃都是后期的，遗传保守性强，所以才没有变异。
    第四，他有永远不满足的思想。他发现抗虫棉还不能消除棉花果实里的害虫，就继续进行钻研，去年他用葫芦、南瓜和棉花进行杂交成功，希望通过这种新试验能得出一个无虫高产的新品种。
    高尔基在一篇短文中曾经写道：“世界上存在着两种思想：一种敢于正视生活中的一大堆的谜，并尽力来揭破这些谜；另一种则认为秘密是无法解释的，并且由于害怕这些秘密而把它们神化了。”他又说：“前者的目的是无止境地从一个真理走向下一个真理，透过所有这些真理来探究最后的真理；后者的目的则是在始终运动、永恒震撼的世界中寻找一个僻静的角落，在那里创立一套无可争辩的教义，用教规的枷锁来束缚研究的和批判的精神。”（转引自“马克思主义哲学原理”第9、10页）
    敢于揭谜！这就是聂寿茂和所有在技术革新运动里努力钻研、大胆创造的先进分子们的风格。毛泽东思想，共产主义风格，就具有这种鲜明的“敢”字精神。一切新的事物，在认识它、掌握它的规律以前，总像是个谜。只有敢于揭谜的人，才能打破它，跨进科学技术的大门，并且马不停蹄，攀登高峰！
