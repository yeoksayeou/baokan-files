    Stop the American Government's Robbery
    *People's Daily* Commentator
    The U.S. State Department issued a statement on February 12, saying that the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique have reached a so-called "agreement" to transport a large number of precious cultural relics of our country, which were robbed to Taiwan by the Chiang Kai-shek clique before liberation, to the United States under the pretext of "exhibition", and have illegally initialed a "contract." The Ministry of Culture of our country has issued a solemn statement on this matter, issuing a serious warning to the U.S. government. The people of our country are extremely angry about this and resolutely oppose this shameless act of robbery by the U.S. government.
    American imperialism is not only an "expert" in aggression but also an "expert" in theft. As early as decades before our country's liberation, the American ruling group has been constantly plundering and destroying our country's cultural relics, causing serious damage to our historical and cultural heritage. In 1954, 1955, 1958, and 1959, the United States carried out conspiracies in the name of so-called "academic groups," trying every possible means to rob our country's precious cultural relics to the United States, which aroused great indignation among the people of our country. Now, the U.S. imperialist looting conspiracy is even more blatant, simply throwing away the mask of the so-called "academic groups," and the State Department is coming forward, attempting to rob the essence of our country's cultural relics, books, and historical archives, etc., which were stolen by the Chiang Kai-shek clique to Taiwan before the national liberation, to the United States. This is something the people of our country will never allow. Plundering the cultural wealth of various countries is an important part of the U.S. imperialist cultural aggression plan. Most of the foreign cultural relics displayed in many museums in the United States were robbed from various countries around the world. American museums can be said to be "赃物馆" (museums of stolen goods) and "罪证馆" (museums of evidence of crimes) of colonialist cultural aggression. China, with its five thousand years of ancient culture, is one of the main targets of plunder by American colonialists. Over the years, U.S. imperialism has painstakingly stolen a large number of ancient cultural relics in our country. In 1949, with the victory of the Chinese People's War of Liberation, the era when U.S. imperialism could run rampant and do whatever it wanted in China was gone forever.
    However, imperialism is imperialism after all, and its aggressive nature will never change. U.S. imperialism still occupies our territory of Taiwan and is still trying every possible means to stage a comeback. Taking the plunder of cultural relics as an example, it has no way to do so on the mainland of the motherland, but for the cultural relics stolen by the Chiang Kai-shek clique to Taiwan before liberation, U.S. imperialism has been wanting to seize them for itself for the past ten years. Now it has used its last resort, openly issuing a statement in the name of the U.S. State Department, and planning to use the U.S. President as the sponsor of the so-called "exhibition" to put pressure on the Chiang Kai-shek clique to achieve its goal of robbing these cultural relics. What a despicable and shameless act of robbery this is!
    The cultural relics stolen by the Chiang Kai-shek clique to Taiwan include the main collections of our Palace Museum, Nanjing Museum (formerly known as the Preparatory Office of the Central Museum before liberation), the Archaeological Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (formerly known as the Archaeological Group of the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica and the Archaeological Group of the Institute of History of the Peiping Research Institute before liberation), the Nanjing Library (formerly known as the Central Library), and other scientific research institutions, totaling more than five thousand boxes. These are extremely precious relics among the cultural treasures of our country for thousands of years, and its sovereignty belongs to the 650 million people of our country and will never allow U.S. imperialism to rob them. The Chiang Kai-shek clique also has no right to dispose of them.
    The Chinese people love the cultural heritage of their motherland and will never allow foreigners to steal it. No matter where these cultural relics are robbed to, whether it is to the ends of the earth or into the hands of the aggressors of which country, we must resolutely retrieve them. Protecting the cultural heritage of the motherland is the sacred responsibility of all Chinese people. Patriotic people and patriotic cultural workers in Taiwan should shoulder their responsibilities and resolutely smash the U.S. imperialist plunder conspiracy.
    No matter what tricks U.S. imperialism plays, what means it adopts, or what kind of "agreements" and "contracts" it signs with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, all are invalid. We warn the U.S. imperialists: immediately stop this criminal act. The Chiang Kai-shek clique should also immediately stop this traitorous act. These cultural relics must be returned to the people of the motherland completely intact at the same time as we liberate Taiwan. If there is any damage or shortage, the U.S. government and the Chiang Kai-shek clique must bear full responsibility.

    制止美国政府的强盗行为
    本报评论员
    美国国务院在2月12日发表声明说，美国和蒋介石集团已经达成所谓“协议”，准备把我国在解放前夕被蒋介石集团劫往台湾的大批珍贵文物，假借“展览”为名，运往美国，并已非法草签“合同”。我国文化部已为此发表严正声明，向美国政府提出严重警告。我国人民对此感到极大的愤怒，并且坚决反对美国政府这一无耻的盗劫行为。
    美帝国主义不仅是侵略“能手”，而且也是盗窃“能手”。远在我国解放前几十年中，美国统治集团就一直不断地劫夺和破坏我国的文物，使我国历史文化遗产受到严重损失。1954年、1955年、1958年和1959年，美国以所谓“学术团体”的名义进行阴谋活动，千方百计地企图把我国珍贵文物劫到美国，曾经激起我国人民的极大愤慨。现在，美帝国主义的掠夺阴谋更加露骨，索性把所谓“学术团体”的假面具抛开，由国务院出面，企图把我国在全国解放前夕被蒋介石集团盗运到台湾的文物、图书和历史档案等精华部分，劫往美国。这是我国人民决不允许的。掠夺各国文化财富，是美帝国主义文化侵略计划的一个重要内容。美国的许多博物馆中所陈列的外国文物，大部分是由世界各国劫夺来的，美国的博物馆可以说是殖民主义者文化侵略的“赃物馆”和“罪证馆”。拥有五千年古文化的中国，更是美国殖民者掠夺的主要目标之一。多少年来美帝国主义处心积虑地在我国盗窃了大量的古文物。1949年，随着中国人民解放战争的胜利，美帝国主义在中国横行霸道，为所欲为的时代一去不复返了。
    但是，帝国主义终究是帝国主义，它的侵略本质是永远也不会改变的。美帝国主义至今还霸占我国领土台湾，还千方百计地企图卷土重来。就以掠夺文物来说，在祖国的大陆上它已无计可施，而对蒋介石集团在解放前夕盗运去台湾的文物，美帝国主义十年来仍然时时刻刻想攫为己有。现在它已使出最后手段，公然用美国国务院名义发表声明，并拟以美国总统作为所谓“展览”的赞助人，来向蒋介石集团施加压力，达到它抢劫这批文物的目的，这是多么卑鄙无耻的强盗行为！
    蒋介石集团所盗运到台湾的文物，其中包括我故宫博物院、南京博物院（解放前称中央博物院筹备处）、中国科学院考古研究所（解放前称中央研究院历史语言研究所考古组和北平研究院历史研究所的考古组）、南京图书馆（解放前称中央图书馆）以及其他科学研究机构中的主要收藏品，为数在五千箱以上。这些都是我国数千年来文化财富中的极为珍贵的遗物，它的主权是属于我国六亿五千万人民所共有，决不容许美帝国主义劫夺，蒋介石集团也无权处理。
    中国人民热爱祖国的文化遗产，决不容许外人盗窃。不论这些文物被劫夺到海角天涯，落入那一国侵略者的手里，我们一定要坚决追回。保护祖国文化遗产是全体中国人民的神圣责任。在台湾的爱国人士和爱国的文化工作者，应当担负起自己的职责，坚决粉碎美帝国主义的掠夺阴谋。
    美帝国主义无论耍何种花招，采用何种手段，与蒋介石集团订立何种“协议”、“合同”，全属无效。我们警告美帝国主义者：立即停止这一罪恶行为。蒋介石集团也应立即停止这一卖国勾当。这批文物必须在我解放台湾的同时，完整无缺的交还祖国人民，倘有丝毫损伤、短少，必须由美国政府和蒋介石集团负担全部责任。
