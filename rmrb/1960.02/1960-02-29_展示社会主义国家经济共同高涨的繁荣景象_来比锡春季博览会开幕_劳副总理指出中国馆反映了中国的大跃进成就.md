Xinhua News Agency, Leipzig, 27th - The opening ceremony of the twenty-fifth Leipzig Fair since the war was held in Leipzig tonight.

    Deputy Prime Minister Heinrich Rau of the German Democratic Republic spoke at the opening ceremony. He said that this Spring Fair would contribute to the development of peace. Heinrich Rau pointed out that the fair reflected the common upsurge of the socialist countries' economies. The Soviet exhibition hall reflects the construction achievements of the Soviet Union and the achievements in conquering the universe. The Chinese exhibition hall reflects the achievements of China's Great Leap Forward, which are the great achievements made by the most populous country on earth in the past year. The exhibition hall of the German Democratic Republic also reflects the achievements of the first year of its seven-year plan and the achievements made in striving to complete the main economic tasks.
    Heinrich Rau also spoke about the foreign trade policy of the German Democratic Republic. He said that signing long-term trade agreements with socialist countries is of great significance to the German Democratic Republic's seven-year plan. He said that there are now many favorable conditions for trade between East and West. Expanding trade between the German Democratic Republic and anti-colonial countries also has great potential at present.
    Speaking of the international situation, Heinrich Rau pointed out that in view of the revival of West German militarism, the conclusion of a German peace treaty is particularly necessary. It is very harmful that many Western countries oppose German unification, do not recognize the German Democratic Republic, and oppose negotiations between the two Germanys.
    In his speech, Heinrich Rau said that the German people are watching the convening of the summit meeting with special interest. He reiterated the proposition that both Germanys must participate in the discussion of the German peace treaty.
    Grotewohl, Premier of the German Democratic Republic, Dieckmann, Chairman of the People's Chamber, government delegations, trade delegations, diplomatic envoys and representatives from all walks of life attended the opening ceremony tonight. The Chinese government delegation to the Leipzig Fair, headed by Li Zhuchen, also attended the opening ceremony.
    At the beginning of the opening ceremony, those present observed a moment of silence for the miners who died in the unfortunate explosion in the Karl Marx coal mine in Zwickau.

    展示社会主义国家经济共同高涨的繁荣景象
    来比锡春季博览会开幕
    劳副总理指出中国馆反映了中国的大跃进成就
    新华社来比锡27日电　战后第二十五次来比锡博览会今天晚上在来比锡举行了开幕仪式。
    德意志民主共和国副总理海因里希·劳在开幕仪式上讲了话。他说，这次春季博览会将对发展和平事业作出贡献。海因里希·劳指出，博览会反映了社会主义国家经济的共同高涨。在苏联展览馆中反映了苏联的建设成就和征服宇宙的成就。中国的展览馆反映了中国的大跃进成就，这是地球上人口最多的国家在过去一年中所取得的伟大成就。德意志民主共和国的展览馆也反映了它的七年计划第一年的成就和在争取完成主要经济任务方面所取得的成就。
    海因里希·劳还谈到德意志民主共和国的对外贸易政策。他说，同社会主义国家签订长期贸易协定对德意志民主共和国的七年计划有极大意义。他说，现在，东西方贸易有很多有利条件。德意志民主共和国同反殖民主义国家扩大贸易，目前也具有极大的可能性。
    在谈到国际局势时，海因里希·劳指出，鉴于西德军国主义的复活，缔结对德和约就特别必要。有许多西方国家反对德国统一，不承认德意志民主共和国，反对两个德国谈判，这是非常有害的。
    海因里希·劳在讲话中说，德国人民以特别的兴趣注视最高级会议的召开。他重申了讨论对德和约必须有两个德国参加的主张。
    今晚出席开幕仪式的有德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥、人民议院主席狄克曼，各国政府代表团、贸易代表团、外交使节和各界人士代表数千人。以李烛尘为首的参加来比锡博览会的中国政府代表团也出席了开幕仪式。
    在开幕仪式开始时，到会者曾向兹维考城卡尔·马克思煤矿不幸发生的爆炸事件中的死难矿工致默哀。
