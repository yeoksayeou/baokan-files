Great Livestock Should Have a Great Development

　　Great livestock are the main driving force of agricultural production at the present stage, and the manure of draft animals is an important source of farm manure. With more and stronger draft animals, we can further implement the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture and better implement intensive cultivation. The problem is obvious: to ensure the continued leap forward in agricultural production this year, great livestock must have a great development. This requires all localities to do everything possible to increase great livestock while vigorously developing pig production, to ensure that all breeding-age female animals can be mated and conceived, that all young animals can survive, and that all livestock are fat and strong, providing more power and fertilizer for agricultural production.

　　Since the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the call to "take pig raising as the center and comprehensively develop animal husbandry" last year, a high tide has formed in pig production across the country, and great livestock have also seen considerable growth. In 1959, the number of great livestock in the country increased by about 40% compared with 1949. It should be said that this is a fairly rapid rate of development. However, such a rate of development is far from meeting the needs of the great leap forward in agricultural production. According to a typical survey conducted by the Pujji People's Commune in Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, the number of draft animals in the commune has increased significantly, and the area of cultivated land burdened by each draft animal has decreased from 62.8 mu in 1949 to 48.1 mu in 1958. However, because the degree of intensive cultivation has greatly increased, the burden on draft animals has not only not been reduced, but has become heavier. Although the number of livestock has increased, it seems more strained than in the past. The situation in this commune reflects the general trend of the country's agricultural production requiring more livestock.

　　Some people think that China's agriculture will be mechanized in the future, and the power of production will be replaced by machines, and therefore doubt whether it is still necessary to develop great livestock with greater efforts now. Indeed, the speed of agricultural mechanization is faster than before, but this matter must not be taken too easily. China has a vast territory and complex natural conditions. To fully realize agricultural mechanization, it is necessary not only for the industrial production sector to manufacture a large number of tractors and other large agricultural machines, but also to have various types of machines adapted to the specific conditions of various regions. This will take a considerable amount of time. This is one aspect. On the other hand, China is a country with a large population and little arable land. At present, each person has an average of only two or three mu of arable land; in the future, after vigorously reclaiming wasteland, China's arable land area will be greatly expanded, but the average area of arable land per person will not increase too much. Therefore, the development of China's agriculture will mainly rely on intensive cultivation, mainly relying on increasing the yield per unit area, which requires agricultural machinery that meets the requirements of further intensive cultivation. A large number of such machines still need to be created by ourselves, and this must have a gradual development process. Even if agricultural production is completely mechanized and electrified in the future, animal power will still be an indispensable auxiliary power. What's more, the use of great livestock is not limited to farming, but has more other uses? With the increasing improvement of people's lives, the requirements for light industry and the food industry are getting higher and higher, and the use of great livestock will be wider and wider. Especially at present, accelerating the development of great livestock, making agricultural production more outstanding, and accumulating more funds for industrial construction is, in fact, creating conditions for the realization of agricultural mechanization.

　　It is very clear that great livestock must develop at a high speed to adapt to the rapidly changing situation of the leap forward. Is it possible to develop at a high speed? The breeding coefficient of great livestock is relatively small, but high speed can also occur. In fact, whether in pastoral areas, agricultural areas, the south, the north, mountainous areas, or plains, advanced examples of high-speed development of great livestock have emerged. Guangfeng County, Jiangxi Province, has achieved "five alls" (all mated, all pregnant, all born, all survive, all strong) in draft cattle due to the strengthening of various aspects of work. In 1959, more than 10,000 cows of reproductive age in the county produced 9,554 calves, with a breeding rate as high as 95% or more. Among the 28 people's communes in the county, 21 communes achieved 100% pregnancy rate for cows, realizing "one calf per cow." The total number of draft cattle in the county increased by 30.48% compared with 1958, which is certainly a great leap forward. There are other regions in the country like Guangfeng County, Jiangxi Province, that have developed great livestock at high speed. According to surveys by relevant departments, in 1959, 175 counties and banners across the country had a great livestock breeding rate of more than 10%. There are even more communes and production teams that have developed great livestock at high speed. So many advanced regions and advanced units that have developed great livestock at high speed not only powerfully demonstrate that great livestock can develop at high speed, but also create extremely rich experience for developing great livestock at high speed. As long as we earnestly summarize their experience and promote these experiences earnestly based on the specific conditions of various places, any region and unit can make great livestock develop at high speed.

　　Giving equal importance to crop cultivation and animal husbandry, and comprehensively developing the agricultural economy, is a fundamental experience of these advanced regions in developing great livestock at high speed. The famous Soviet soil scientist Williams has long demonstrated the dialectical relationship of mutual dependence and balanced development between agriculture and animal husbandry. With the high-speed development of animal husbandry, providing a continuous stream of power, fertilizer and funds for agricultural production, agriculture can continuously expand reproduction. At the same time, with the development of agricultural production, providing abundant feed for animal husbandry, the development of animal husbandry has a full and reliable material basis. Agriculture and animal husbandry support each other and promote each other, and can change the face of agricultural production to the greatest extent and in the shortest time. Guangfeng County, Jiangxi Province, mentioned above is a prominent example. This county was historically a grain-deficient area. In previous years, there were few draft cattle, and they could only do one plow and one harrow before transplanting rice seedlings. The cultivation was rough and there was little fertilizer, so the yield was very low. After liberation, the leadership focused on developing great livestock, and the area burdened by each draft cattle was reduced from 60 mu at the beginning of liberation to the current 14 mu, achieving three plows and four harrows, and universally deep plowing without delaying the farming season. In addition to the increase in cattle and fertilizer, and the promotion of other yield-increasing measures, the county's grain yield per mu in 1959 was as high as 1,099 jin, and the total output increased by two times compared with 1949, and it became one of the advanced counties in Jiangxi Province.

　　In terms of animal husbandry itself, these advanced regions have earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's policy of "taking pig raising as the center and comprehensively developing animal husbandry," and have earnestly implemented the principle of treating cattle, donkeys, horses, and mules equally and developing them comprehensively in the development of great livestock. Some people believe that after communization, large mules and horses should be used more, and they are unwilling to use cattle and donkeys more. Mules and horses are powerful and run fast, and it is of course very necessary to value mules and horses. However, we should also value the development of cattle and donkeys. Because cattle and donkeys account for the largest number of existing great livestock in China, accounting for about 80% of the total number of great livestock. Ignoring the breeding and development of cattle and donkeys will, of course, greatly affect the development speed of great livestock. In fact, cattle and donkeys have a wide range of uses in agricultural production and people's lives in China, and they have many advantages. Cattle can cultivate fields, pull carts, accumulate fertilizer, provide milk, and supply people's meat needs. Cowhide and bones are also important industrial raw materials, and the comprehensive utilization rate of cattle is the highest. Donkeys eat less, work more, are gentle in temperament, and are flexible in body, especially suitable for mountain production. More importantly, without donkeys, there would be no mules, and valuing donkeys is equivalent to valuing mules. Therefore, in developing great livestock, we must have a comprehensive perspective and must give equal importance to cattle, donkeys, mules, and horses at the same time in order to ensure the high-speed development of livestock.

　　The key to the high-speed development of great livestock is to seize breeding and reproduction, and to carry out the "five alls" movement. Realizing the full mating, full pregnancy, full birth, full survival, and full strength of livestock is another important experience of these advanced regions in the high-speed development of great livestock. There is no development without reproduction, and the level of the breeding rate depends first on the mating work and on improving the pregnancy rate. Before communization, agricultural cooperatives had few livestock and heavy labor, and it was difficult to resolve the contradiction between labor and reproduction. Many agricultural cooperatives were afraid of delaying labor and did not allow female animals to conceive. After communization, under the reasonable allocation and unified arrangement of the commune, this contradiction can be appropriately resolved, and many communes have already realized the full pregnancy of female animals. However, in most areas, because the number of great livestock cannot meet the needs of agricultural production, this contradiction has not been completely resolved. We should make the greatest efforts to overcome this imbalance in the shortest period of time. The contradiction between reproduction and labor is a question of how to correctly combine long-term interests and immediate interests. In dealing with the contradiction between reproduction and labor, we must certainly take into account current interests, but more importantly, we must obey long-term interests. If it is said that before communization, in the era of individual economy, this was a contradiction that could not be completely resolved; then now, in the people's commune that is large in size and collective in nature, as long as the labor is planned and adjusted in a unified manner, this contradiction can be appropriately resolved. In addition, the contradiction between feeding costs and use value not being well resolved is also a major reason why the development of great livestock in some areas has been affected to a certain extent. They say that raising great livestock is not worthwhile, the cost is high, and the use is small. In fact, this is because the comprehensive utilization of great livestock has not been developed. By resolving the comprehensive utilization of great livestock, such as allowing draft cattle to not only plow the fields, but also pull carts and grind mills, and not only use them for labor, but also ask them for milk, meat, and industrial raw materials, the contradiction between feeding costs and use value can be completely resolved. At present, the spring mating season has arrived, and all localities must seize the opportunity to take all effective measures to ensure that all breeding-age female animals can be mated. Most great livestock only produce one litter a year, and if the spring mating season is missed, there is a risk that the task of developing great livestock this year will fail. Party committees at all levels must strengthen their leadership over this work, launch a mass mating movement, and ensure that no female animal goes unfertilized through the spring.

　　While carrying out the full mating and full pregnancy movement and accelerating the development of great livestock, all localities should also establish breeding bases in a planned manner. Each people's commune should also run breeding farms, reproduction farms, and young animal breeding farms, which is of great importance to improving livestock breeds, continuously breeding livestock, ensuring "five alls," and improving livestock breeding rates. With a certain number of breeding farms for selection and mating, the quality of livestock can be continuously improved. Concentrating breeding-age female animals in the reproduction farm and taking care of them in terms of labor can ensure that female animals are fully pregnant and fully productive, and can better breed young animals. Young animal breeding farms carefully feed and scientifically manage young animals, which can make young animals grow strong. In short, establishing "three farms" in the people's commune is of great importance to ensuring the high-speed development of great livestock and gradually realizing the improvement of great livestock breeds.

　　Party organizations at all levels, especially the party organizations of the people's communes, should grasp the breeding, mating, and feeding management of great livestock in the same way as they grasp agriculture and pig raising. In strengthening feeding management, in addition to earnestly resolving issues such as feed and disease prevention, special attention should be paid to the selection and education of feeders. It is necessary to select and assign those who have high political consciousness and love this cause to serve as feeders. We must establish the ambition to develop great livestock at high speed, cultivate advanced pacesetters, strengthen leadership over weak links, launch a mass movement to develop great livestock, and at the same time, we must also earnestly resolve a series of specific issues related to the high-speed development of great livestock, such as feed, fodder, disease prevention, use, and protection of draft animals. We must ensure that the country's great livestock have a greater development this year.

### 大牲畜要有一个大发展

    大牲畜要有一个大发展
    大牲畜是现阶段农业生产的主要动力，耕畜粪尿又是农家肥料的重要来源。有了更多更强壮的耕畜，就能进一步贯彻农业八字宪法，更好地实行精耕细作。问题很明显，为了保证今年农业生产持续跃进，大牲畜必须有一个很大的发展。这就要求各地在大抓养猪生产的同时，千方百计地增殖大牲畜，保证所有的适龄母畜都能配种受胎，所有的幼畜都能成活，所有的牲畜都膘肥体壮，为农业生产提供更多的动力和肥料。
    去年党中央和毛主席提出：“以养猪为中心、全面发展畜牧业”的号召以后，全国养猪生产已经形成高潮，大牲畜也有了相当的增长。1959年全国大牲畜头数比1949年增加了40％左右。应该说，这是相当快的发展速度。但是，这样的发展速度，还远远不能满足农业生产大跃进的需要。根据陕西省兴平县普集人民公社的典型调查，公社耕畜的头数有了较大的增加，每头耕畜负担耕地面积由1949年的六十二点八亩降为1958年的四十八点一亩，但是由于精耕细作的程度大大提高，耕畜的负担量不但没有减轻，反而更重了。牲畜增多了，但却显得比过去更紧张些。这个公社的情况反映了全国农业生产需要更多牲畜的总趋势。
    有人以为，我国农业将来要实现机械化，生产的动力将由机器来代替，因而怀疑，现在还有没有必要以更大的努力来发展大牲畜。的确，农业机械化的速度是要比以前快的，但是也决不能把这件事情看得太容易。我国幅员广大，自然条件复杂，要全部实现农业机械化，不仅需要工业生产部门制造出大量的拖拉机和其他大型农业机器，而且还要求有适应各种地区具体条件的各种各样的机器型号，这是需要相当长的时间的。这是一方面。另一方面，我国又是一个人多而耕地少的国家，目前一个人平均才有二三亩耕地；将来经过大力开荒，我国的耕地面积会大大扩大，但每个人的平均占有耕地面积也不会增加太多。因此，我国农业的发展将主要依靠精耕细作，主要依靠提高单位面积产量，这就需要有适应进一步精耕细作要求的农业机器。这样的机器大量的还需要我们自己去创造，而这就必须有一个逐步发展的过程。即使将来农业生产完全实现机械化和电气化，畜力依然是不可缺少的辅助动力。何况大牲畜的用途不仅限于耕作方面，还有更多的其他方面的用途呢？随着人民生活的日益提高，对于轻工业和食品工业的要求愈来愈高，大牲畜的用途将是愈来愈广。特别是在目前，加快了大牲畜的发展，将农业生产搞得更加出色，为工业建设积累更多的资金，也就在实际上为实现农业机械化创造着条件。
    大牲畜必须高速度发展，才能适应一日千里的跃进形势，这是很清楚的。能不能高速度发展呢？大牲畜的繁殖系数比较小是事实，但是同样可以出现高速度。实际上，无论牧区、农业区，无论南方、北方，无论山区、平原，都已经出现了高速度发展大牲畜的先进典型。江西广丰县由于加强了各方面的工作，耕牛实现了“五全”（全配、全准、全生、全活、全壮），1959年全县一万多头有繁殖能力的母牛，共产下小牛九千五百五十四头，繁殖率高达95％以上。这个县的二十八个人民公社中，有二十一个公社的母牛达到百分之百的满怀，实现了“一母一仔”。全县耕牛总头数比1958年净增30．48％，这当然是特大的跃进。像江西广丰县高速度发展大牲畜的县，全国其他地区也有，据有关部门调查，1959年，全国有一百七十五个县、旗的大牲畜增殖率达10％以上。至于高速度发展大牲畜的公社和生产队就更多了。这样多的高速度发展大牲畜的先进地区和先进单位，不仅有力地说明了大牲畜能够高速度发展，而且也为高速度发展大牲畜创造了极其丰富的经验。只要认真地总结他们的经验，并从各地的具体条件出发，认真地推广这些经验，任何地区和单位，都能使大牲畜高速度发展。
    种植业和畜牧业并重，全面发展农业经济，是这些先进地区高速度发展大牲畜的一条根本的经验。著名的苏联土壤学家威廉氏早就论证过农牧业相互依赖、平衡发展的辩证关系。畜牧业高速度发展了，为农业生产提供源源不绝的动力、肥料和资金，农业就能不断扩大再生产。同时，农业生产发展了，为畜牧业提供丰富的饲料，畜牧业的发展才有充分可靠的物质基础。农牧业互相支援，互相促进，就能在极大程度上和最短的时间内改变农业生产的面貌。前面谈到的江西广丰县就是一个突出的例子。这个县历史上是缺粮地区，往年耕牛少，只能做到一犁一耙就插秧，耕作粗放，肥料又少，产量很低。解放以后领导上抓紧发展大牲畜，每头耕牛的负担面积由刚解放时的六十亩减为现在的十四亩，做到三犁四耙，普遍深耕，不误农时。加上牛多肥料也多，以及其他增产措施的推行，这个县1959年粮食亩产高达一千零九十九斤，总产量比1949年增长两倍，一跃而为江西的先进县份之一。
    在畜牧业本身方面，这些先进地区认真贯彻了毛主席关于“以养猪为中心、全面发展畜牧业”的方针，在发展大牲畜中认真贯彻了牛、驴、马、骡一视同仁、全面发展的原则。有人认为公社化以后，应该多使用大骡子大马，不愿多使牛用驴。骡马力量大，跑得快，重视骡马当然是十分必要的。但是也应当重视牛驴的发展。因为牛和驴在我国现有大牲畜中所占数量最大，约占整个大牲畜总数的80％左右。忽略对牛驴的繁殖发展，当然要极大的影响大牲畜的发展速度。事实上，牛驴在我国农业生产和人民生活中的用处很广，它们优点很多。牛可以耕田，可以拉车，可以积肥，可以挤奶，可以供应人们的肉食需要。牛皮、牛骨又是重要的工业原料，牛的综合利用率最高。驴吃得少，干活多，性情温顺，身躯灵便，特别适合山区生产。更重要的是没有驴就没有了骡，重视驴也就等于重视了骡。因此在发展大牲畜时必须有全面观点，必须牛驴和骡马同时并重，才能够保证牲畜发展的高速度。
    大牲畜高速度发展的关键是抓紧配种繁殖，开展“五全”运动。实现牲畜的全配、全准、全生、全活、全壮，是这些先进地区大牲畜高速度发展的又一重要经验。没有繁殖就谈不到发展，而繁殖率的高低，首先取决于配种工作，取决于提高满怀率。公社化以前，农业社由于牲畜少，劳役重，很难解决役使和繁殖的矛盾，许多农业社怕耽误役使，不使母畜怀驹。公社化以后，在公社合理调配，统一安排下，这个矛盾是可以适当解决的，而且已经有许多公社实现了母畜满怀。但是，在大部分地区，由于大牲畜在数量上不能满足农业生产的需要，这个矛盾并没有彻底解决。我们应该以最大的努力，在最短期间克服这种不平衡的状况。繁殖和役使的矛盾是长远利益和眼前利益如何正确结合的问题。在处理繁殖和役使矛盾时，我们固然要照顾到当前利益，更重要的是服从长远利益。如果说在公社化以前，在个体经济时代，这是一个不可能彻底解决的矛盾；那末在现在，在一大二公的人民公社里，只要在役使上统筹安排，合理调剂，这个矛盾是能够适当解决的。另外，饲养成本同使用价值的矛盾没有很好解决，也是使一部分地区大牲畜的发展受到一定影响的一个主要的原因。他们说养大牲畜不合算，成本大，用场小。其实，这是没有发展大牲畜综合利用的原故，解决了大牲畜的综合利用，比如耕牛不仅使之犁田，还让它拉车、拉磨，不仅役使，还向它要奶、要肉和要工业原料，饲养成本和使用价值的矛盾就可以彻底解决了。目前，春季配种季节已到，各地要抓紧时机，采取一切有效措施，使全部适龄母畜都能配上种。一般的大牲畜大都是一年产一胎，错过了春季配种季节，今年发展大牲畜的任务就有落空的危险。各级党委要加强对这一工作的领导，大搞群众性的配种运动，保证不让一头母畜空怀过春。
    在开展全配满怀运动，加速大牲畜发展的同时，各地还应该有计划地建立繁殖基地。每个人民公社还应该办种畜场、繁殖场和幼畜培育场，这对于改良牲畜品种，源源不断地繁殖牲畜、保证“五全”、提高牲畜的繁殖率是有很大关系的。有了一定的种畜场进行选种配种，就可以不断提高牲畜的质量。繁殖场内集中适龄的母畜，在使役上加以照顾，可以保证母畜全胎全产，更好地繁殖幼畜。幼畜培育场精心饲养和科学地管理幼畜，能使幼畜长得健壮。总之，在人民公社建立“三场”，对于保证大牲畜高速度发展和逐步实现大牲畜良种化是有十分重要的作用的。
    各级党组织，特别是人民公社党组织，应当像抓农业和养猪业那样，大抓大牲畜的繁殖配种和饲养管理工作。在加强饲养管理中，除认真解决饲料、防疫等问题以外，特别要注意对饲养员的选择和教育，一定要选派那些政治觉悟高的、热爱这一事业的人担任饲养员。必须树立高速度发展大牲畜的雄心壮志，培养先进的标兵，加强对薄弱环节的领导，开展群众性的发展大牲畜的运动，同时，还要切实解决饲料、饲草、防疫、使用和保护耕畜等有关大牲畜高速度发展的一系列具体问题，一定要使全国的大牲畜今年有一个更大的发展。
