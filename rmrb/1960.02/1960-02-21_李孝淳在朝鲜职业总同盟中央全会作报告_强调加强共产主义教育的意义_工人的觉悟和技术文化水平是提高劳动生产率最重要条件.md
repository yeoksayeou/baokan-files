Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 19th. Li Xiaochun, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Professional General Federation, delivered a report to the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Professional General Federation on the 18th, emphasizing the significance of strengthening communist education for workers. He said, "Improving workers' comprehensive level of awareness and technical and cultural level is the most important condition for improving labor productivity." Pyongyang newspapers today published an abstract of Li Xiaochun's report.

In his report, Li Xiaochun talked about the issue of strengthening communist education for workers, quoting a passage from Comrade Kim Il-sung's speech at the Korean Workers' Party Central Plenary Session held last December regarding the elements constituting productivity. Kim Il-sung said: "What is decisive for increasing labor productivity is the noble thought of the workers who are determined to dedicate all their energy and wisdom to the struggle for the motherland and the people, and for their own happiness. When the workers' political consciousness is raised, they will work harder to improve their technical level, and will exert greater creativity, enthusiasm and talent to explore all potential and possibilities for increasing production."

In his report, Li Xiaochun said that the unprecedented development of productivity in Korea after the war was due to the revolutionary enthusiasm of the working people who, under the wise leadership and inspiration of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, engaged in selfless and creative labor. Without this fact, the great changes and developments that have taken place in Korea recently cannot be understood. This is why the Korean Workers' Party emphasizes putting political work ahead of all work, including economic work.

Li Xiaochun said that, therefore, trade union organizations must make every effort to strengthen communist education for the working people. Trade union organizations should strengthen the education of the revolutionary traditions of the Korean Workers' Party to the working people, so that they can become revolutionary fighters who, like the revolutionary martyrs, will spare no effort to fight for the revolution. At the same time, it is necessary to explain and implement the policies and lines of the Korean Workers' Party among them, so that they can recognize the correctness of the revolution and establish a firm confidence in the victory of the revolution; and that they clearly know what the current struggle goal is and how to do it for the victory of the revolution. Li Xiaochun pointed out that it is also necessary to widely use all the tools of political and cultural activities of trade union organizations to cultivate the communist attitude of the working people towards labor.

Li Xiaochun said that in order to improve labor productivity, it is necessary to ensure labor conditions, improve equipment utilization, widely adopt advanced technologies and new operating methods, and promote the mechanization and automation of operations.

Li Xiaochun also pointed out that in all sectors of the people's economy, it is necessary to adhere to the socialist distribution principle of distribution according to the quality and quantity of labor. Combine material incentives with morality and politics to promote a surge in production.

When talking about further strengthening the socialist emulation movement, Li Xiaochun said that trade union organizations at all levels should further launch a socialist labor emulation among workers to greet the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Korea on "August 15" this year with high labor achievements.

    李孝淳在朝鲜职业总同盟中央全会作报告
    强调加强共产主义教育的意义
    工人的觉悟和技术文化水平是提高劳动生产率最重要条件
    新华社平壤19日电　朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会委员长李孝淳在18日向职业总同盟中央委员会第二次全体会议作报告，强调指出加强对工人进行共产主义教育的意义。他说，“提高工人的全面的觉悟水平和技术文化水平，是提高劳动生产率的最重要的条件”。平壤报纸今天发表了李孝淳这个报告的摘要。
    李孝淳在报告中谈到加强对工人的共产主义教育的问题时，引述了金日成同志在去年12月举行的朝鲜劳动党中央全会上讲的关于构成生产力的因素的一段话。金日成说：“对提高劳动生产率有决定意义的是工人们为了祖国和人民、为了自己的幸福而决心献出自己的一切精力和智慧来进行斗争的高尚思想。当工人的政治觉悟得到提高的时候，他们就会更加努力提高自己的技术水平，就会发挥更大的创造性、热情和才能，来挖掘一切增加生产的潜力和可能性。”
    李孝淳在报告中说，战后朝鲜生产力所以获得史无前例的发展，就是由于劳动人民在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党中央委员会的英明领导和鼓舞下，发挥了革命热情，进行了忘我的创造性的劳动。离开了这个事实，对朝鲜最近时期发生的伟大变革和发展就决不能理解。朝鲜劳动党所以强调在包括经济工作的一切工作中，使政治工作走在前面，原因就在这里。
    李孝淳说，因此，工会组织要尽一切努力加强对劳动人民的共产主义教育。工会组织要对劳动人民加强朝鲜劳动党的革命传统教育，使他们像革命先烈一样成为为革命不惜一切而进行斗争的革命战士。同时，必须在他们中间解释和贯彻朝鲜劳动党的政策和路线，使他们认识到革命的正确性，树立坚强的革命胜利信心；使他们清楚地知道，为了革命的胜利，当前的斗争目标是做什么，怎样来做。李孝淳指出，还要广泛地利用工会组织的一切政治和文化活动的工具，来培养劳动人民对劳动的共产主义态度。
    李孝淳说，为了提高劳动生产率，要保证劳动条件，提高设备利用率，要广泛采用先进技术和新的作业方法，促进作业的机械化和自动化。
    李孝淳还指出，在一切人民经济部门中要坚持根据劳动的质和量来进行分配的社会主义分配原则。把物质刺激同道德、政治结合起来，以促进生产的高涨。
    李孝淳在谈到进一步加强社会主义竞赛运动时说，各级工会组织要在工人中进一步展开社会主义劳动竞赛，以高度的劳动成就来迎接今年“八·一五”朝鲜解放十五周年。
