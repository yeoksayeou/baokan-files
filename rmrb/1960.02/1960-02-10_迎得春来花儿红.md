    The north wind howls furiously, snowflakes flutter everywhere;
    The bugle sounds amidst the wind and snow, the battleground shakes with the charge.
    Railway workers have high aspirations, unafraid of the cold weather and snow,
    The train still runs at high speed, all difficulties are scared away.
    The Spring Welcoming Campaign is entirely red,
    The train crew heroes have made the greatest contribution,
    The train rushes through the wind and snow,
    There is no winter before heroes.
    Raise the red flag, achieve great merit,
    Day after day, month after month, a house full of red,
    Heroes have lofty ambitions,
    Ushering in spring with red flowers.

    迎得春来花儿红
    古冶机务段　李子芳呼呼北风怒号，漫漫雪花纷飘；风雪中鸣起号角，冲锋战地动山摇。铁路工人志气高，那怕天寒风雪飘，列车依旧高速跑，万般困难全吓掉。迎春战役全面红，乘务英雄立首功，列车冲过风和雪，英雄面前无寒冬。举红旗，立大功，日日月月满堂红，英雄立下凌云志，迎得春来花儿红。
