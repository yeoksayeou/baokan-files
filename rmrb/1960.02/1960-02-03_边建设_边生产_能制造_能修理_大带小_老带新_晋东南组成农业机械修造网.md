Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Electric Dispatch: The Southeast Shanxi Special District of Shanxi Province has formed a mechanized manufacturing and repair network that combines large, medium, and small enterprises, integrates indigenous and foreign methods, and primarily serves agricultural mechanization.

Currently, the entire special district has 42 county-run and above machinery factories capable of manufacturing and repairing machinery, an average of more than three per county or city. Each county and city has an agricultural machinery manufacturing and repair plant, and some have also established small and medium-sized motor manufacturing plants, machine tool plants, vehicle plants, as well as bearing plants, general machinery plants, and mining machinery plants. The production process in these machinery factories has been semi-mechanized or mechanized. In 1959, the total output value of the district's machinery industry increased by 53% compared to 1958, and the number of main product varieties increased from 48 to 115, including various precision machine tools, bearings, power machinery, electric motors, generators, agricultural machinery, water conservancy irrigation and drainage machinery, agricultural and sideline product processing tools, and cooking machinery, etc. Last year alone, 1,188 precision machine tools were produced.

The development of the machinery industry has played a huge role in promoting the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. More than half of the 42 machinery factories in the district directly serve agriculture. In 1959, these factories produced 15,000 new agricultural machines such as mountain plows, deep plows, and horse-drawn harvesters, and manufactured and repaired more than 3 million pieces of irrigation and drainage machinery and transportation tools such as waterwheels, water pumps, and flatbed carts, supporting the rural people's communes in developing agricultural production, overcoming the worst drought in nearly 20 years, and ensuring a bumper harvest. Last year, the machinery factories also produced more than 300,000 pieces of canteen equipment such as blowers and vegetable cutters, enabling more than 60% of the canteens to achieve semi-mechanization, mechanization, or indigenous mechanization; they manufactured more than 200,000 pieces of tools such as small steel mills and top-pin mills, greatly improving the efficiency of agricultural and sideline product processing; at the same time, they provided a large amount of mechanical equipment for other industries, promoting the transition of these enterprises from "small indigenous clusters" to "small foreign clusters," such as manufacturing more than 20,000 sets of metallurgical and mining equipment, creating conditions for the basic transition of the "small indigenous clusters" steel bases to the current 23 "small foreign clusters" steel plants. The machinery factories also armed the commune industries with mechanical equipment and technical forces, helping the people's communes build more than 1,000 factories and mines such as farm tool manufacturing and repair, agricultural and sideline product processing, fertilizer, and small-scale mineral exploitation, enabling more than 55% of the people's communes to install indigenous or foreign motors and light up electric lights.

In developing the machinery industry, this special district conscientiously implemented a series of policies for walking on two legs, such as the simultaneous development of large, medium, and small enterprises, and the integration of indigenous and foreign methods. It adopted the methods of building while producing, using production to support construction, and using construction to promote production. The first step was to gradually develop the joint factory farm tool repair groups in various counties into independent small and medium-sized machinery factories that could both repair and manufacture, in the spirit of using foreign methods whenever possible, using indigenous methods when foreign methods were not possible, and transitioning from indigenous to foreign. Then, adopting the method of "mother hen laying eggs and hatching chicks," on the one hand, it developed and strengthened the county-run and above machinery industry, making it evolve from low-level to high-level, with increasingly detailed divisions of labor, some engaged in general machinery manufacturing and repair, some specializing in the production of certain products, and developing towards "high, precise, and large." At the same time, it rapidly improved the degree of mechanization through large-scale collaboration, large leading small, and old leading new. On the other hand, it extracted a certain amount of manpower to train technical personnel for the communes and manufacture mechanical equipment to arm the commune industries. As a result, the foundation of the district's machinery industry expanded, and the machinery industry repair and manufacturing network spread throughout the region, beginning to realize the situation of "repairing various machines themselves, manufacturing general machinery, saving manpower and increasing efficiency, and achieving a double leap forward in industry and agriculture."

This year, the district's machinery industry plans to produce more power machinery, power generation equipment, irrigation and drainage machinery, and other agricultural machinery to support agriculture, while also producing a large number of mechanical equipment to arm other industries. Based on summarizing their work in 1959, all the employees of the machinery industry are establishing lofty ambitions and are working enthusiastically to complete the glorious tasks of 1960.

### 边建设　边生产　能制造　能修理　大带小　老带新  晋东南组成农业机械修造网

    边建设　边生产　能制造　能修理　大带小　老带新
    晋东南组成农业机械修造网
    据新华社太原电　山西省晋东南专区已经组成一个大中小结合、土洋结合、为农业机械化服务为主的机械化制造修配网。
    现在，全专区拥有能制造和修配机械的县营以上机械工厂四十二座，平均每个县市有三座以上。各县市都有农业机械修造厂，有的还建立了中小型电机制造厂、机床厂、车辆厂以及轴承厂、通用机械厂和矿山机械厂等工厂。全区还设有四个中心制造修配厂，担任各县修配不了的任务。这些机械厂的生产过程已经实现了半机械化或机械化。1959年，全区机械工业的总产值比1958年增长53％，主要产品品种由四十八种增加到一百一十五种，其中包括各种精密机床、轴承、动力机械、电动机、发电机、农业机械、水利排灌机械、农副产品加工工具和炊事机械等等；仅精密机床去年就生产了一千一百八十八台。
    机械工业的发展，对促进工农业生产大跃进起了巨大的作用。全区四十二座机械厂中，有一半以上是直接为农业服务的。这些工厂在1959年内生产了山地犁、深耕犁、马拉收割机等新式农业机械一万五千部，制造与修配了水车、水泵、小平车等排灌机械和运输工具三百多万件，支援农村人民公社发展了农业生产，战胜近二十年来未有的大旱，保证了丰收。各机械工厂去年还生产了吹风机、切菜机等食堂机具三十多万件，使60％以上的食堂实现了半机械化、机械化或土机械化；制造了小钢磨、顶针碾等工具二十多万件，大大提高了农副产品加工效率；同时，为其他工业提供了大量机械设备，促进这些企业由“小土群”向“小洋群”过渡，如制造冶金矿山设备二万多台，为“小土群”钢铁基地基本过渡为现在的二十三座“小洋群”钢铁厂，创造了条件。各机械工厂还以机械设备和技术力量武装了公社工业，帮助各人民公社建起了农具修造、农副产品加工、化肥、小型矿藏开采等厂矿一千多座，使55％以上的人民公社装上了土的或洋的电机，点上了电灯。
    这个专区在发展机械工业中，认真贯彻执行大中小并举，土洋并举等一系列两条腿走路的方针。采取了边建设、边生产，以生产养建设、以建设促生产的方法。第一步，本着能洋就洋、不能洋就土、由土到洋的精神，逐步将各县联合厂农具修配组发展成为独立的、既能修配又能制造的中小型机械厂。然后，采取母鸡下蛋孵小鸡的办法，一方面发展壮大县营以上机械工业，使之由低级到高级，分工越来越细，有搞一般机械修造的，有专门生产某种产品，并且向“高、精、大”发展的。同时，通过大搞协作、以大带小、以老带新的办法，迅速提高机械化程度。另一方面，抽出一定的力量为公社培养技术人材和制造机械设备，武装公社工业。这样做的结果，使全区机械工业的基础扩大，机械工业修配、制造网遍布各地，开始实现“各种机具自己修，一般机械能制造，省人省力效率高，工业农业双跃进”的局面。
    今年，全区机械工业计划生产更多的动力机械、发电设备、排灌机械和其他农业机具支援农业，同时生产大批机械设备武装其他工业。机械工业的全体职工在总结1959年工作的基础上，树立雄心壮志，正在干劲冲天地为完成1960年的光荣任务而奋斗。（附图片）
