A poem composed of numbers – the press communique on the development of the national economy in 1959 has been published. The communique tells us that the 1959 national economic plan was greatly overfulfilled, and the main indicators of the Second Five-Year Plan were also victoriously achieved three years ahead of schedule.

The communique also shows that the development of China's national economy is both high-speed and proportional.

Why can the national economy of our country, which originally had relatively backward productive forces, develop at both high speed and proportionally? I think we should explore this from the practice of socialist construction in our country.

Hold High the Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Resolutely Implement the General Line of Socialist Construction

The high-speed and proportional Great Leap Forward in China's national economy has its material and ideological foundations.

The establishment of socialist relations of production, the victorious completion of the three major transformations, and the preliminary foundation of socialist industrialization laid during the First Five-Year Plan are extremely important material foundations for promoting the high-speed development of China's national economy. After the victorious completion of the three major transformations, a socialist revolution was launched on the political and ideological fronts, which unprecedentedly liberated social productive forces and the enthusiasm of the working people. This is a very important ideological foundation for promoting the high-speed development of China's national economy. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong seized this favorable situation and promptly put forward the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, as well as a complete set of policies of walking on two legs. This general line concentratedly expressed the strong desire of the people of the whole country to change the "poor and blank" face of our country, and fully mobilized the socialist enthusiasm of the people of the whole country, which naturally formed a comprehensive Great Leap Forward situation throughout the country.

Persist in Putting Politics in Command, Persist in the Mass Line

The general line of socialist construction and a complete set of policies of walking on two legs pointed out the direction for the high-speed and proportional development of the national economy. However, in actual implementation, it is still necessary to implement putting politics in command and the mass line at all times. This basic experience has long been proven by countless facts.

If it were not for putting politics in command and vigorously launching mass movements, even if the conditions were good, the work might be backward. Conversely, even if the conditions were poor, it might be able to catch up later. For example, the red flag of blast furnace ironmaking has always been planted in the No. 1 Ironmaking Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company (producing 2.4 tons of iron per cubic meter per day and night, while the national average is 1.56 tons), and the red flag of open-hearth steelmaking has always been planted in the small open-hearth furnace of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 (producing 14.5 tons of steel per square meter per day and night, while the national average is 8.21 tons), while the production technology conditions of Benxi Steel's blast furnace and Shanghai Steel No. 3's open-hearth furnace are not good enough. Examples like this are too numerous to mention.

How to treat putting politics in command and the mass line is a fundamental issue related to socialist construction. Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly taught us: Politics is the soul, is the commander, and political work is the lifeline of all economic work. Lenin also instructed us: "Politics is the concentrated expression of economics... politics cannot but take precedence over economics." "If the working class does not handle things correctly from a political point of view, it will be unable to maintain its rule, and therefore it will be unable to solve its production tasks." (Lenin's Collected Works, Volume 32, pp. 71-72) Lenin here refers to solving production tasks from a political point of view, that is, correctly handling the contradictions between the superstructure and the economic base, the contradictions between the relations of production and the productive forces, so as to give full play to people's enthusiasm. As Lenin said: "Since we are called the Communist Party, we should understand that only now, when we have cleared external obstacles and destroyed the old system, the first task of the real proletarian revolution – to organize hundreds of millions of people – is really and thoroughly put before us for the first time." (Lenin's Collected Works, Volume 29, pp. 302, 303) Our party follows this principle and insists on putting politics in command and launching mass movements vigorously. Because of this, a Great Leap Forward that is both high-speed and proportional has emerged in China's national economy.

Starting from 600 Million People, Overall Planning and Appropriate Arrangement

In order to mobilize all positive factors, give full play to people's subjective initiative, and further achieve a high-speed and proportional Great Leap Forward in the national economy, in planning work, we must start from 600 million people, take overall consideration, and make appropriate arrangements. First of all, we must take care of both national construction and people's livelihood, taking into account the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual, and correctly handle the distribution and use of national income in terms of accumulation and consumption.

The national income is directly used for consumption, starting from 600 million people; the state takes out a part of the accumulation fund from the national income for expanded reproduction, also starting from 600 million people.

In 1958 and 1959, under the conditions of a 34% and 21.6% increase in China's national income, the amount of accumulation increased greatly, thereby ensuring the high-speed Great Leap Forward of socialist construction. However, at the same time, the people's living standards have also been greatly improved. In 1958, the average consumption level of the people of the whole country increased by about 8%, of which the consumption level of farmers increased by about 10%; in 1959, the average wages of employees (excluding new employees) increased by about 5%, and the state's expenditure on labor insurance, medical expenses, welfare expenses, etc. for employees increased by more than 16%, and the average income of members of rural people's communes increased by about 10%. That is to say, in the two years of continuous Great Leap Forward, although the amount of accumulation increased rapidly, the improvement of people's living standards was also unprecedented. Therefore, we can conclude that as long as the people's living standards are guaranteed to have the necessary improvement, the growth rate of the accumulation amount, although faster, will not cause an imbalance in the national economy, but will further promote the high-speed Great Leap Forward of the national economy, and further promote the planned and proportional development of the national economy.

Combining Priority Development of Heavy Industry and Rapid Development of Agriculture

The appropriate arrangement of accumulation and consumption focuses primarily on the correct arrangement of the production of the two major categories, as well as the proportional relationship between heavy industry production, light industry production, and agricultural production, which reflects the production of the two major categories. This is the most fundamental proportional relationship in the national economy. Practice has proved that as long as the proportional relationship between heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture is properly arranged, the needs of production and construction and people's lives can be guaranteed in kind, and thus the entire national economy can have a high-speed and proportional Great Leap Forward.

As mentioned above, in the development of China's national economy in the past two years, the proportional relationship between industry and agriculture, and the proportional relationship between heavy industry and light industry have become increasingly coordinated. This fact strongly shows that not only can heavy industry develop at high speed, but also agriculture and light industry can develop at high speed while giving priority to the development of heavy industry. Everyone knows that in the process of socialist industrialization, the growth of industry is faster than agriculture, and the growth of heavy industry is faster than light industry, which is an inevitable trend. However, agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry are mutually conditional, mutually combined, and mutually promoted. Therefore, under the condition of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, accelerating the development of agriculture and making the proportional relationship between them more coordinated is more beneficial to the development of the entire national economy.

Comrade Mao Zedong has always emphasized the importance of developing agriculture while first affirming the priority development of heavy industry. As early as 1945, in the report of the Seventh Party Congress, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out the importance of developing agriculture in national economic construction. Later, in the "Report on Ten Major Relationships" and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Comrade Mao Zedong further demonstrated the importance of developing agriculture and its relationship with heavy industry and light industry. He said: "Our economic construction is centered on heavy industry, which must be affirmed. But at the same time, we must pay full attention to the development of agriculture and light industry." "The development of industry must go hand in hand with the development of agriculture, so that industry has raw materials and markets, and it is possible to accumulate more funds for the establishment of a strong heavy industry." The several policies of simultaneous development in the basic points of China's general line of socialist construction are based on Comrade Mao Zedong's thought as a theoretical foundation. It can be seen that the close integration of industry and agriculture is an important law of socialist economic development. Comrade Mao Zedong creatively summarized this important law as: agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, without agriculture there is no light industry, heavy industry needs agriculture as an important market, the development of industry must go hand in hand with the development of agriculture, etc. This is a model of creatively applying Marxist reproduction theory, and it is also a strategic measure of decisive significance for the continuous Great Leap Forward of China's national economy.

Vigorously Carry Out Technological Revolution and Technological Innovation, and Continuously Improve Labor Productivity

Vigorously carrying out technological revolution and technological innovation, and continuously improving labor productivity, is another important factor for the high-speed and proportional Great Leap Forward of China's national economy.

The basic points of the general line of socialist construction require that while continuing to complete the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts, we actively carry out technological revolution and cultural revolution. In the continuous Great Leap Forward of 1958 and 1959, we took a big step forward on the road of technological revolution and technological innovation. According to incomplete statistics, in the past year, the number of technological innovation proposals and inventions put forward and implemented by the masses of employees on all fronts across the country reached more than 37 million, exceeding the total accumulated in the past few years before 1959. More than 200 million new-style farm implements and improved farm implements have been promoted on the agricultural front. With the widespread and in-depth development of technological revolution and technological innovation, social labor productivity has been significantly improved, thereby greatly promoting the high-speed Great Leap Forward of the national economy. At the same time, in the movement of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward, the relatively backward departments also caught up due to the development of technological revolution and technological innovation, realizing active balance in high-speed development. Therefore, technological revolution and technological innovation are also important factors for proportional development.

    既能高速度  又能按比例
    杨坚白
    一个用数字组成的诗篇——关于1959年国民经济发展情况的新闻公报公布了。公报告诉我们，1959年的国民经济计划大大超额完成了，同时第二个五年计划的主要指标，也已经提前三年胜利实现了。
    公报也表明，我国国民经济的发展，既是高速度又是按比例的。
    为什么在我国这样一个原来生产力比较落后的国家，国民经济既能高速度发展，又能按比例发展呢？我认为应当从我国社会主义建设实践中来探求。
    高举毛泽东思想的红旗，坚决贯彻社会主义建设总路线
    我国国民经济所以能够高速度、按比例的大跃进，是有它的物质基础和思想基础的。
    社会主义生产关系的建立，三大改造的胜利完成，以及第一个五年计划期间奠定起来的社会主义工业化的初步基础，这是推动我国国民经济能够高速度发展的极其重要的物质基础。而在三大改造胜利完成之后，接着就在政治战线上和思想战线上开展了社会主义革命，使社会生产力和劳动人民的积极性获得了空前的解放。这又是推动我国国民经济能够高速度发展的十分重要的思想基础。党中央和毛泽东同志抓紧这种有利形势，又及时地提出了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线和一整套两条腿走路的方针，这条总路线集中地表现了全国人民力求改变我国“一穷二白”面貌的强烈愿望，充分调动了全国人民的社会主义的积极性，这就自然而然地在全国形成一个全面大跃进的局面。
      坚持政治挂帅，坚持群众路线
    社会主义建设总路线和一整套两条腿走路的方针，给我们指出了国民经济高速度、按比例发展的方向。但是，在实际执行中也还要时时刻刻地贯彻政治挂帅和群众路线。这一条基本经验，早已被无数的事实所证明。
    如果不是政治挂帅，不是大搞群众运动，即使条件好，工作也可能落后，反过来，即使条件差，反而可能后来居上。例如，高炉炼铁的红旗一直插在本溪钢铁公司第一炼铁厂（每立方米一昼夜炼铁二点四吨，而全国平均为一点五六吨），平炉炼钢的红旗一直插在上海炼钢三厂的小平炉（每平方米一昼夜炼钢十四点五吨，而全国平均为八点二一吨），而本钢高炉和上钢三厂平炉的生产技术条件，并不够好。像这类事例是举不胜举的。
    如何对待政治挂帅和群众路线，是关系到社会主义建设的根本问题。毛泽东同志反复教导我们说：政治是灵魂，是统帅，政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。列宁也曾指示我们说：“政治是经济的集中表现……政治同经济相比，不能不占首位”。“一个阶级如果不从政治上正确地处理问题，就不能维持它的统治，因而也就不能解决它的生产任务。”（列宁全集三十二卷71——72页）列宁在这里所指的从政治上解决生产任务，也就是正确处理上层建筑和经济基础的矛盾，生产关系和生产力的矛盾，从而把人的积极性充分发扬起来。还是像列宁所说的：“既然我们叫做共产党，我们就应当懂得，只有现在，当我们清除了外部障碍，摧毁了旧制度的时候，在我们面前才第一次真正地和彻底地提出了真正无产阶级革命的第一个任务——把亿万人民组织起来。”（列宁全集第二十九卷，302、303页）我们党就是按照这个原则，坚持政治挂帅和大搞群众运动的。正因为如此，所以在我国国民经济中就出现了既是高速度又是按比例的大跃进。
    从六亿人口出发，统筹兼顾，适当安排
    为了调动一切积极因素，充分发挥人的主观能动性，进而达到国民经济高速度、按比例的大跃进，在计划工作中，必须从六亿人口出发，统筹兼顾，适当安排，首先就是既要照顾国家建设，又要照顾到人民生活，兼顾国家利益、集体利益和个人利益，正确处理国民收入在积累和消费方面的分配和使用问题。
    国民收入直接用于消费方面，是从六亿人口出发的；国家从国民收入中提出一部分积累基金用于扩大再生产，也是从六亿人口出发的。
    1958年和1959年，我国在国民收入增长34％和21．6％的条件下，积累额有很大增长，从而保证了社会主义建设高速度的大跃进。但是，与此同时，人民生活水平也有很大提高。1958年，全国人民平均消费水平提高了8％左右，其中农民的消费水平提高了10％左右；1959年，职工平均工资（不包括新职工）增长5％左右，国家用于职工的劳动保险金、医药费、福利费等等的开支增加16％以上，农村人民公社社员的平均收入，大约增长10％左右。这就是说，在两年的连续大跃进中，虽然积累额增加很快，但是人民生活水平的提高也是空前的。因此，我们可以得出结论说：只要保证人民生活水平有必要的提高，积累额的增长速度虽然快一些，并不会造成国民经济的比例失调，反而会更加促进国民经济的高速度大跃进，更加促进国民经济有计划按比例的发展。
    优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业结合起来
    积累和消费的适当安排，其着眼点首先在于正确安排两大部类的生产，以及体现两大部类生产的重工业生产、轻工业生产、农业生产之间的比例关系。这是国民经济中最根本的比例关系。实践证明，只要把重工业、轻工业、农业之间的比例关系安排好了，也就从实物上保证了生产建设和人民生活的需要，因而整个国民经济也就可以高速度、按比例的大跃进。
    如上所说，两年来在我国国民经济发展中，工业和农业的比例关系，重工业和轻工业的比例关系，已经是越来越协调了。这一事实有力地表明，不仅重工业可以高速度发展，而且在优先发展重工业的同时，农业和轻工业也可以高速度发展。大家知道，在社会主义工业化过程中，工业的增长快于农业，重工业的增长快于轻工业，这是一个必然趋势。但是农业、轻工业和重工业三者是互为条件，互相结合，互相促进的。因此，在优先发展重工业的条件下，加速农业的发展，使它们之间的比例关系更加协调，对于整个国民经济的发展是更为有利的。
    毛泽东同志从来是在首先肯定优先发展重工业的同时，强调发展农业的重要性的。远在1945年，在第七届党代表大会的报告中毛泽东同志就指出了发展农业在国民经济建设中的重要性，以后毛泽东同志在“关于十大关系的报告”和“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中，又进一步论证了发展农业的重要意义及其与重工业和轻工业的关系。他说：“我国的经济建设是以重工业为中心，这一点必须肯定。但是同时必须充分注意发展农业和轻工业。”“发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举，工业才有原料和市场，才有可能为建立强大的重工业积累较多的资金。”我国社会主义建设总路线基本点中的几个并举的方针，就是以毛泽东同志的这一思想作为理论基础的。由此可见，工农业密切结合是社会主义经济发展的重要规律。毛泽东同志把这一重要规律创造性的概括为：农业是国民经济的基础，没有农业就没有轻工业，重工业要以农业为重要市场，发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举，等等，这正是创造性地运用马克思主义再生产理论的典范，也是我国国民经济连续大跃进的有决定性意义的战略措施。
    大搞技术革命和技术革新，不断提高劳动生产率
    大搞技术革命和技术革新，不断提高劳动生产率，是我国国民经济能够高速度、按比例大跃进的又一个重要因素。
    社会主义建设总路线的基本点要求，在继续完成经济战线、政治战线、思想战线上的社会主义革命的同时，积极开展技术革命和文化革命。在1958年和1959年的连续大跃进中，我们在技术革命和技术革新的道路上迈进了一大步。据不完全统计，一年来，全国各个战线上的职工群众提出并已付诸实施的技术革新建议和发明创造共达三千七百多万件，超过1959年以前几年累积的总和。在农业战线上推广的新式农具和改良农具达到两亿多件。随着技术革命和技术革新的广泛深入展开，社会劳动生产率有了显著的提高，因而大大推动了国民经济的高速度大跃进。同时，在学先进、赶先进、帮后进的运动中，比较后进的部门，也由于技术革命和技术革新的展开而赶上前去，实现了高速度发展中的积极平衡。因此，技术革命和技术革新又是按比例发展的重要因素。
