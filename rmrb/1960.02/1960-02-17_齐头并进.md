Keeping Pace

A mass movement of technical innovation centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization is developing extensively and deeply throughout the country. In recent days, good news has been coming in continuously, reflecting the excellent situation of technical innovation: In many industries, manual operations in production units have largely been mechanized and semi-mechanized in a short period. Old equipment has been reformed, labor efficiency has increased many times, ten times, dozens of times, and a large amount of labor has been saved. The slogan of "increasing production without increasing manpower" is being realized everywhere. This is a gratifying feat in the first year of the sixties, how inspiring!

Today, we published the news that the factories in Erdaohezi District of Changchun City are universally carrying out the "Production Renovation" movement, accelerating the technological transformation process of small and medium-sized enterprises. This news, like the news of the technological innovation movement published a few days ago, brought joyful news: In the past three months, the spearhead of the movement has been tightly directed at manual operations, and the broad masses of workers have vigorously engaged in mechanization and semi-mechanization. The proportion of mechanized and semi-mechanized operations in the district's industrial sector has increased to 60.4%. Under the condition of no additional personnel and no increase in foreign equipment, the production level in early February in the district increased by 19% compared with early November last year, labor productivity increased rapidly, and production plans were overfulfilled every ten days. This fully demonstrates the great achievements of technological innovation.

In the "Production Renovation" movement in Erdaohezi District of Changchun City, a significant feature is that the development of productive forces and the improvement of production relations are advancing simultaneously. That is, combining the transformation of production technology with the reform of enterprise management, and combining the innovation of technical equipment with the improvement of workers' technical level. The latter is an important prerequisite for the development of productive forces, while the former is a necessary measure to improve production relations. Productive forces are the most active and most revolutionary factor in production; the reason why this factor is the most active and most revolutionary is not only because the change of production tools is often the vanguard of the development of productive forces, and thus it is not only by relying on simple equipment updates, mechanization, and automation that productive forces can leap forward; but more importantly, it lies in the labor force – the changes in people's spiritual outlook and technical level. When people's ideological awareness is improved, operating skills are mastered, and production experience is enriched, it is possible to better operate machinery, innovate technology, and make productive forces advance rapidly. Therefore, people are the decisive factor in productive forces. Therefore, in the transformation of production development, one cannot "see things but not people." The factories in Erdaohezi District of Changchun City grasped the transformation of "things" with one hand and the improvement of "people" with the other, which gave the technological innovation movement a positive, active, and revolutionary impetus. As a result, more than 1,500 workers who had just freed themselves from manual operations have proficiently or relatively proficiently mastered mechanical operations; more than 800 new workers have also improved their technical level and participated in technological innovation. This has added a huge and decisive force to the development of productive forces.

The rapid development of productive forces requires certain aspects of production relations to keep up quickly. This is required by the objective law of the adaptation of production relations to productive forces. If certain aspects of production relations are not improved in accordance with the transformation of productive forces, it will affect the smooth progress of productive forces. If certain aspects of production relations can be improved in a timely manner, it can enable productive forces to leap forward. While carrying out the "Production Renovation" movement, the Party organizations of the factories in Erdaohezi District of Changchun City grasped technological innovation with one hand and enterprise reform with the other, carried out the "Business Renovation" movement among the staff of the departments, improved enterprise management, and improved the relationship between the staff of the departments and the workers, which gave the technological innovation movement for the development of productive forces an important guarantee of production relations that adapted to it. Therefore, the technological innovation movement in Erdaohezi District of Changchun City can achieve such great achievements.

The bustling mass movement of mechanization and semi-mechanization is developing rapidly, and the dialectical relationship of mutual dependence, mutual restriction, and mutual promotion between productive forces and production relations must be handled in a timely and proper manner. In this way, the socialist production relations can better adapt to the development of productive forces.

    齐头并进

    一个以机械化和半机械化为中心的技术革新的群众运动，在全国各地广泛地深入地开展着。近几天来，好消息不断传来，反映了技术革新的大好形势：不少行业的生产单位的手工操作，在短时间里，大部分实现了机械化和半机械化。旧设备得到了改革，劳动效率成倍、十倍、几十倍地提高，劳动力大量的节约，“增产不增人”的口号在处处实现。这是六十年代第一年的可喜壮举，多么令人欢欣鼓舞啊！
    今天，我们发表了长春市二道河子区各工厂普遍开展“生产翻新”运动，加速了中小型企业技术改造进程的消息。这个消息同前几天发表的技术革新运动的消息一样，传来了可喜的捷音：三个月来，运动的矛头紧紧指向手工操作，广大工人大搞机械化和半机械化。全区工业部门机械化和半机械化操作比重提高到60．4％。在不添人、不增洋设备的条件下，全区2月上旬的生产水平比去年11月上旬提高19％，劳动生产率迅速提高，生产计划旬旬超额完成。这充分说明了技术革新的巨大业绩。
    在长春市二道河子区的“生产翻新”运动中，一个显著的特点是，发展生产力和改善生产关系齐头并进。那就是，把生产技术的改造和企业管理的改革结合起来，把革新技术装备和提高工人技术水平结合起来。后者是发展生产力的重要前提，而前者是改善生产关系的必要措施。生产力是生产中最活跃最革命的因素；这个因素之所以是最活跃最革命的，不仅因为生产工具的改变常常是生产力发展的先锋，因而不仅仅是依靠单纯的更新装备、机械化自动化就能够使生产力突飞猛进；而更重要的，是在于劳动力——人的精神面貌和技术水平的变化。人的思想觉悟提高了，操作技术熟练了，生产经验丰富了，就有可能更好地操作机械、革新技术，而使生产力迅猛跃进。所以，人是生产力的决定因素。因此，在发展生产的变革中，不能“见物不见人”。长春市二道河子区各厂一手抓“物”的改造，一手抓“人”的提高，这就使技术革新运动有了积极的活跃的革命的动力。结果，全区一千五百多名刚刚摆脱手工操作的工人，已经熟练或比较熟练地掌握了机械操作；八百多名新工人也提高了技术水平，参加了技术革新。这就使发展生产力增加了巨大的决定的力量。
    生产力的迅速发展，要求生产关系的某些方面迅速跟上去。这是生产关系和生产力相适应的客观规律所要求的。生产力变革了，生产关系的某些方面如不相适应地改善，那就会影响生产力的顺畅前进。生产关系的某些方面如能及时改善，那就能使生产力飞跃前进。长春市二道河子区各厂党组织在“生产翻新”运动的同时，一手抓技术革新，一手抓企业改革，在科室人员中大搞“业务翻新”运动，改善企业管理，改进科室工作人员和工人的关系，这就使发展生产力的技术革新运动，有了与之相适应的生产关系的重要保证。所以，长春市二道河子区的技术革新运动就能得到那样的巨大业绩。
    热火朝天的机械化和半机械化的群众运动，正在迅速发展，生产力和生产关系的相互依存、相互制约、相互促进的辩证关系，一定要及时地妥善处理。这样，才能使社会主义的生产关系更好地适应生产力的发展。
