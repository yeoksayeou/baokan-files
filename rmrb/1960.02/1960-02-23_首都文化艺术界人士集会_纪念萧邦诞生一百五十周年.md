Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd - Capital cultural and art circles gathered at the Capital Theater today to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the birth of Frederic Chopin, the world-renowned Polish musician.

    More than 1,200 people attended the commemoration, including Mao Dun, Ding Xilin, Yang Hansheng, Lü Ji, Cai Chusheng, and Zhao Feng.

    Charge d'affaires ad interim Fularato and Counselor Dumbnitzky of the Polish Embassy in China, as well as peace, cultural and art guests from various countries in Beijing also attended the commemoration.

    The commemoration was presided over by Mao Dun, a member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, a Standing Committee member of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, President of the Sino-Polish Friendship Association, and Vice Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. In his opening remarks, he said: Chopin was born in an era when the Polish people suffered brutal foreign aggression and oppression. The Polish people's national liberation movement educated Chopin, and in turn, Chopin's works inspired the Polish people's national liberation movement. Today, as we commemorate Chopin, we should inherit and carry forward Chopin's fighting will against aggression and oppression, and resolutely oppose the US imperialists' conspiracies of expanding armaments and preparing for war under the guise of peace, and their reactionary policies of expanding colonialism.

    Zhao Feng, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Chinese Musicians Association, delivered a report at the meeting entitled "Chopin - The Great Singer of the Polish People." He introduced Chopin's life and the historical background of his musical creation, and pointed out: The content of Chopin's works profoundly expresses a musician's infinite love for his motherland, deep concern for the fate of his motherland, fierce hatred for foreign oppression, and firm confidence in victory. Zhao Feng also pointed out that from his childhood, Chopin loved folk music and Polish national culture. His works have patriotic and democratic ideological content, and also have distinct national characteristics in form, and the musical language is permeated with national characteristics. Chopin's music grew and took root in the soil of folk music. Zhao Feng finally said: The Chinese people have had similar experiences to the Polish people being oppressed by foreign powers in the 19th century. Therefore, the Chinese people feel exceptionally close to the patriotic and anti-feudal democratic ideas in Polish literature and art that oppose foreign oppression.

    Counselor Dumbnitzky of the Polish Embassy in China also spoke at the meeting. He focused on introducing the art and influence of Chopin's works, and pointed out that because Chopin sought his creative source from the tradition, history, and artistic source of his own nation - Polish folk music, he became such a music creator belonging to all mankind.

    The commemoration was jointly sponsored by the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the China People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the Sino-Polish Friendship Association, the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Chinese Musicians Association. A Chopin concert was held after the meeting.

    首都文化艺术界人士集会
    纪念萧邦诞生一百五十周年
    新华社22日讯　首都文化艺术界人士今天在首都剧场集会，纪念世界文化名人，波兰音乐家弗列德里克·萧邦诞生一百五十周年纪念日。
    出席纪念会的，有茅盾、丁西林、阳翰笙、吕骥、蔡楚生、赵沨等一千二百余人。
    波兰驻华大使馆临时代办傅拉托、参赞邓布尼茨基以及各国在京的和平文化艺术客人也参加了纪念会。
    纪念会由世界和平理事会常务委员会委员、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会常务委员、中波友好协会会长、中国文学艺术界联合会副主席茅盾主持。他在开幕词中说：萧邦生于波兰人民遭受残酷的外国侵略和压迫的时代。波兰人民的民族解放运动教育了萧邦，反过来，萧邦的作品又鼓舞了波兰人民的民族解放运动。今天我们纪念萧邦，应该继承和发扬萧邦的反抗侵略和压迫的斗争意志，坚决反对美帝国主义在玩弄和平花招下进行扩军备战的阴谋和扩展殖民主义的反动政策。
    中国音乐家协会书记处书记赵沨在会上作了“萧邦——波兰人民伟大的歌手”的报告。他介绍了萧邦的生平和他音乐创作的时代背景，并指出：萧邦的作品的内容，深刻地表现了一个音乐家对祖国的无限热爱，对祖国命运的深切关怀，对异族压迫的激烈愤恨，以及对于胜利的坚定信心。赵沨还指出，萧邦从幼年时起，就热爱民间音乐，热爱波兰的民族文化，他的作品具有爱国主义、民主主义的思想内容，形式上也具有鲜明的民族色彩，音乐语言中浸透着民族的特征。萧邦的音乐是在民间音乐的土壤中滋长和生根的。赵沨最后说：中国人民曾经有过和十九世纪的波兰被异族压迫的类似遭遇。因此中国人民对波兰文学艺术中反对异族压迫的爱国主义和反封建的民主主义思想，感到异常亲切。
    波兰驻华大使馆参赞邓布尼茨基也在会上讲了话。他着重介绍了萧邦的作品艺术和影响，并指出：萧邦由于从自己民族的传统、历史和艺术的源头——波兰的民间音乐中去寻找自己的创作泉源，他才会成为属于全人类的这样一个音乐创造者。
    纪念会由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会，中国人民对外文化协会，中国波兰友好协会，中国文学艺术界联合会，中国音乐家协会联合举办。会后还举行了萧邦作品音乐会。
