"He who has not been to the Great Wall is not a true man."
Zhai Xiangdong
    Sky high, clouds light,
    Gazing until the wild geese vanish south.
    He who has not been to the Great Wall is not a true man,
    Calculating the journey, twenty thousand li!
    On the peak of Mount Liupan,
    Red banners stream in the western wind.
    Today the long rope is in my hand,
    When will I bind the grey dragon?

Every time I read Chairman Mao's magnificent poem, an image immediately appears before my eyes: a revolutionary heroic team is marching, despite the difficult journey, the red flag is fluttering, and people are full of pride in having traveled 20,000 li, full of spirit, and taking firmer steps towards the final destination... The emergence of this picture always gives me great encouragement and adds infinite strength.

The historical Long March of 25,000 li is long past. Countless heroes have not only reached the Great Wall (the anti-Japanese front) and bound the grey dragon (Japanese imperialism), but have also won a series of brilliant victories and completed even more glorious historical tasks. However, our ultimate goal is to realize communism. If we compare this ultimate goal to the Great Wall, and the entire journey to reach this goal to the Long March of 25,000 li, then we still need to move forward and move forward quickly. In this sense, the saying "He who has not been to the Great Wall is not a true man" is still a loud call to us, summoning us to continue to fight unremittingly for the realization of communism.

A true man, this is the spiritual outlook of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation. Countless heroes have emerged in our history, and they have made great contributions to the nation and the people, so they have been admired forever by future generations. However, "to count heroic figures, we must look to the present." Because today's heroes are communist heroes fighting for the highest ideals of mankind. They have the ambition to realize communism throughout the country and even the world, and they also have the soaring drive to resolutely realize this ambition. They are more worthy of admiration than the heroes of history. It is precisely because of such heroes that we have overthrown the three great mountains that were pressing down on us, kicked away many difficulties in building socialism on a poor and blank land, and in only a decade, we have made the country look brand new, unrecognizable, and we must also draw the newest and most beautiful picture - the transition to communism, and persevere in the struggle. No matter what class enemies or enemies of nature, they cannot stop us from moving forward.

The soul of a communist hero is the communist ambition. Those who do not have communist ambitions should not even think about becoming a communist hero. This ambition is not only expressed verbally, but more importantly, in practice. Only those who truly show a strong communist flame in practice, and truly take the realization of communism in the world as their own responsibility, and never give up until the goal is achieved, can be considered to have a true communist ambition. This ambition can also be said to be revolutionary heroism. With this ambition, one will be full of courage, have the greatest courage and perseverance, and will not hesitate to go through fire and water in order to realize communism. In any case, one will be a revolutionary optimist. "Where there is a will, there is a way." The so-called "one who has a will" refers to such a person. On the contrary, if one only says that one wants communism in words, but in practice shows "no great ambition in life, but only seeks to be warm and full," is short-sighted, and does not take the infinitely beautiful communist society of mankind as the ultimate goal, and only regards socialism as a stage of transition to communism, but on the existing achievements "calculates the journey of twenty thousand li" and wants to set up camp, then this can never be called a communist hero. People who truly have communist ambitions always see the great light of communism, and regard all the achievements in front of them as nothing more than things on the way to communism. They also "calculate the journey of twenty thousand li," but they are never complacent, never stop moving forward, but because they see a brighter future more clearly, they have more confidence in realizing communism, more enthusiasm, and they keep moving without stopping. We must establish such an ambition. Such an ambition is the Marxist-Leninist ambition, the expression of the proletarian worldview. To establish a proletarian worldview, one must first establish this ambition.

It is necessary to get to the Great Wall, it is necessary to be a hero, but it is not possible to take one step to reach it. One step cannot reach it. It is necessary to go step by step and in stages. To not know that the revolution has stages, and that it must go from one stage to another, actually negates the continuous development of the revolution. We talk about the stages of revolutionary development precisely to better promote the continuous advancement of the revolution. In the historical Long March of 25,000 li, people crossed thousands of rivers and mountains before finally reaching their destination. To reach communism, we also need to cross thousands of rivers and mountains. However, we must never slow down and drag on because the journey is long; on the contrary, we must move forward step by step, climb higher step by step, cross the Jinsha River, cross the Dadu River, cross the snow mountain, cross the grassland,... and always carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution. Continuous revolution is continuous development, this is absolute; the stage of revolutionary development is relative. If the continuous revolutionary nature is extracted from the revolutionary cause, and only the revolutionary stage is wanted, the revolution will stagnate. Therefore, on the road of building socialism, we must always engage in continuous revolution in our thinking, so that communist ideas increase day by day, and we must always engage in continuous revolution in economic construction, so that communist factors increase day by day. There is a kind of thinking that is harmful, that is, every time there is some progress, one wants to stop and is unwilling to move forward immediately. People with this kind of thinking, when they think about the future and look at the future, often feel that this is difficult and that is difficult, and they are afraid of difficulties. This is the expression of the worldview of lazy people and cowards. Whoever this worldview attaches to will inevitably not be a doer, but a lazy person, and will see difficulties as small as needles as bigger than steel beams, and even see success as a difficulty. In fact, difficulties are afraid of brave men, and true brave men are those who have the spirit of continuous revolution. With the spirit of continuous revolution, and giving full play to subjective initiative, difficulties will melt away like ice cubes meeting sunlight. "When people are brave, there are no difficulties; when people are lazy, difficulties arise," this is the fact. If we compare difficulties to the grey dragon, the spirit of continuous revolution is like the long rope that binds the grey dragon. If we want to bind the grey dragon, we must always have the long rope in our hands.

On the road to communism, no one should fall behind, and falling behind is not glorious. However, this is not enough, we should also strive to be in the forefront. Only when everyone strives to be in the forefront can we have the sustained leap forward in all our undertakings, can we make the next victory closer to the previous victory, and can we make communism come sooner. To go all out, aim high, is for this purpose. Starting from this requirement, we must adhere to making one day equal to twenty years in any work we do, and we must never let twenty years equal one day. We must adhere to making a thousand li a day, and we must never walk half a li in three or five days. This requires racing against time, and doing as much as possible in as short a time as possible. At the same time, we must also climb to the top and reach the peak. Yesterday we climbed a ten-li peak, today we must climb a hundred-li peak, and tomorrow we must climb a thousand-li peak. In this way, we can walk in the forefront of the team, in the forefront of the great era, and we can also ensure that we will never fall behind.

Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the people of our country, holding high the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, are striving to be communist heroes. After winning a series of victories, they have completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, bringing our country's socialist construction into a new stage.

This new stage will be a new test for everyone. Because, although the current situation is indeed infinitely good, we still need to solve many, many contradictions, both large and small, to achieve the above tasks. Therefore, on our way forward, there are still the Jinsha River, the Dadu River, the snow mountains, and the grasslands... However, with the long rope in hand, we are about to bind the "grey dragon" (obstacles and difficulties). True communist fighters will certainly be able to withstand this test and be tempered into more determined heroes. In their progress, they will still receive great encouragement from Chairman Mao, and Chairman Mao's following poems will surely give everyone great strength: The Red Army fears not the trials of the Long March, Holding light ten thousand crags and torrents. The Five Ridges wind like gentle ripples, And the roaring Wumeng surges, claylike. Warm the steep cliffs are washed by the waters of the Chinsha, And chilled are the iron chains that span the Tatu bridge. Sweet is the snow on the Minshan Mountains after the three armies have passed, every face wears a smile.

### “不到长城非好汉”

    “不到长城非好汉”
    翟向东
    天高云淡，
    望断南飞雁。
    不到长城非好汉，
    屈指行程二万！
    六盘山上高峰，
    旄头漫卷西风。
    今日长缨在手，
    何时缚住苍龙？
    每读毛主席这首雄壮的词，就立即在眼前出现这样的图画：革命的英雄队伍在行进着，尽管路途艰险，然而红旗飘扬，人们怀着走过两万里行程的自豪感，精神焕发，为了要达到最后的目的地，迈起更坚定的步伐……。这个图画的出现，又总是给自己极大的鼓舞，增加无限的力量。
    历史上的两万五千里长征，早已经过去了，无数好汉不只到达了长城（抗日前线），缚住了苍龙（日本帝国主义），更在后来夺得了一连串的光辉胜利，完成了更加光荣的历史任务。但是，我们的最终目的，是实现共产主义，要把这个最终的目的比作长城，把达到这个目的的整个行程比作两万五千里长征，就还需要我们继续前进，快步前进。从这个意义上说，“不到长城非好汉”这一警句，对我们仍然是一个响亮的召唤，它召唤我们为实现共产主义而继续奋斗不懈。
    好汉，这是中华民族优秀儿女的精神面貌。我国历史上曾出现过数不清的好汉，他们为民族、为人民做出了极大的贡献，因此千古流芳，永远为后人所敬仰。然而“数英雄人物还看今朝”。因为今天的好汉是为实现人类最高理想而奋斗的共产主义的好汉，他们有在全国也在全世界实现共产主义的雄心，也有坚决实现这种雄心的冲天干劲，是比历史上的好汉更值得钦敬的。正因为有这样的好汉，我们才一下掀翻了压在我们身上的三座大山，踢开了在一穷二白的土地上建设社会主义的许多困难，为时仅仅十载，就使江山面目一新，不可复识，并且还要为画最新最美的画图——向共产主义过渡，坚持斗争。不管是什么阶级敌人或者是自然界的敌人，都不能阻止我们前进。
    共产主义好汉的灵魂是共产主义的雄心壮志。没有共产主义雄心壮志的人，休想当共产主义的好汉。这种雄心壮志，不是只表现在口头上，更重要的是表现在实践中。真正在实践中表现出有旺盛的共产主义火焰，确实以天下实现共产主义为己任，不达到目的决不罢休，才算真有共产主义的雄心壮志。这种雄心壮志也可以说是革命的英雄主义。有了这种雄心壮志，就会浑身是胆，有最大的勇敢和毅力，为了实现共产主义，赴汤蹈火在所不辞，在任何情况下，都是革命的乐观主义者。“有志者事竟成”。所谓“有志者”正是指这样的人。相反，如果只是在口头上说要共产主义，在实践中却表现了“平生无大志，但求足温饱”，目光短浅，不以人类无限美好的共产主义社会作最终目的，不把社会主义只看作是向共产主义过渡的一个阶段，而在既有的成就上“屈指行程二万”，就想安营扎寨，这就无论如何不能叫做共产主义的好汉的。真正有共产主义雄心壮志的人，永远看到共产主义的万丈光芒，把眼前的一切成就，都看做不过是到达共产主义的途程中的事，他们也“屈指行程二万”，却从不自满，从不裹足不前，而是因为更清楚的看到了前程似锦，实现共产主义的信心更足，干劲更大，马不停蹄，日行千里。我们正是要树立这样的志向。这样的志向，是马克思列宁主义的雄心壮志，是无产阶级世界观的表现。要树立无产阶级世界观，就必得先立下这种雄心壮志。
    一定要到长城，一定要作好汉，并不是一步就要迈到。一步是迈不到的，应当有步骤有阶段地走到。不知革命之有阶段，必须由这一阶段到另一阶段，实际上就否定了革命的不断发展。我们讲革命发展的阶段性，正是为了更好地推动革命不断前进。在历史上的两万五千里长征中，人们曾涉万水、跋千山，最后才到达了目的地。我们到达共产主义，也需要涉万水，跋千山。可是，我们绝不能因为路途遥远，就慢慢腾腾，拖拖拉拉；相反，一定要步步向前，步步登高，过了金沙江，要过大渡河，过了雪山，要过草地，……永远发扬不断革命的精神。不断革命就是不断发展，这是绝对的；革命发展的阶段性是相对的。如果从革命事业中抽出不断革命性，光要革命阶段性，革命就会停顿。因此，我们在建设社会主义的路上，永远要搞思想上的不断革命，使共产主义思想一天天多起来，永远要搞经济建设的不断革命，使共产主义因素一天天多起来。有一种思想是有害的，那就是每当有些微进展就想停一停，不愿意紧接着挺进。有这种思想的人，想一想未来，看一看前程，常常觉得这也困难，那也困难，怕困难怕成一团。这是懒汉与懦夫的世界观的表现。这种世界观附了谁的体，必然不是干字当头，而是懒字当头，针大的困难看得比钢梁还大，甚至把顺利也看成困难。其实，困难怕勇夫，真正的勇夫就是有不断革命精神的人。有了不断革命精神，充分发挥主观能动性，困难就会像冰块遇到了阳光，渐渐消融。“人勇困难无，人懒困难出”，事实就是如此。如果把困难比作苍龙，不断革命精神就好比缚住苍龙的长缨。我们要想缚住苍龙，就一定要长缨永远在手。
    在到共产主义的路上，谁也不应当掉队，掉队是不光彩的。不过，这还不够，还应当力争走在前列。人人力争走在前列，才有我们各项事业的持续跃进，才能使下一个胜利距离前一个胜利更近些，使共产主义来到得更快些。鼓足干劲、力争上游，就是为了这个目的。从这个要求出发，我们做任何工作，都要坚持使一天等于二十年，切不可让二十年等于一天，要坚持一日千里，切不可半里路走他三天五日。这就要与时间赛跑，以尽量短的时间，干尽量多的事情。同时，还要攀尖端，登高峰，昨天登十里峰，今天要登百里峰，明天要登千里峰。这样，才可以走在队伍的前列，走在伟大时代的前列，也才能保证永远掉不了队。
    我国人民在毛主席领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，争当共产主义好汉，在夺得了一连串的胜利之后，又提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标，使我国的社会主义建设进入了新阶段。
    这个新阶段对每个人将是一个新的考验。因为，当前形势确实无限好，但是毕竟要解决许许多多、大大小小的矛盾，才能实现以上任务。因此，在我们前进的路上，就还有金沙江、大渡河，还有雪山、草地……。可是，长缨在手，正是要缚“苍龙”（障碍和困难），真正的共产主义战士，将一定能经得起这一考验，锻炼成更坚定的好汉。他们在前进中，依然会从毛主席那里得到极大的鼓舞，毛主席的以下诗句，必会给大家以极大的力量，这就是：红军不怕远征难，万水千山只等闲。五岭逶迤腾细浪，乌蒙磅礴走泥丸。金沙水拍云崖暖，大渡桥横铁索寒。更喜岷山千里雪，三军过后尽开颜。
