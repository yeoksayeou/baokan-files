Xinhua News Agency, February 26th, Moscow dispatch from TASS on February 25th: TASS commentator Yegorov writes: The heads of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization military-political groups are striving to vigorously activate these two aggressive groups, which are despised by the people. The participants of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's "discussion" held in Lahore not long ago had not yet left when the summit of the heads of the three Middle Eastern countries (Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey) participating in the Central Treaty Organization military group began there. The Iranian "Morning News" directly linked the two meetings held in Lahore. The newspaper wrote that at the summit of the heads of state of the Central Treaty Organization member states—Islamic countries, "opinions will be exchanged on the issue of establishing an anti-communist alliance in Asia, and the methods for resolving this issue proposed at the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization member states' meeting will be studied." Another Iranian newspaper, "Observer," wrote that during the talks, the issue of unified action by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization in "fighting communism" would be discussed.

These reports have aroused understandable unease in Eastern countries because people there are very aware that colonialists always invoke the "communist danger" to frighten people whenever they prepare to infringe upon their freedom and independence.

Yegorov writes that the purpose of whipping up anti-communist frenzy in our time is to intensify international tensions and obstruct the easing of tensions that have emerged in relations between countries. Under the banner of "anti-communist alliance," advocates of aggressive policies are attempting to drag those Eastern countries that do not belong to any existing treaty into the clutches of military blocs. Cold War maintainers understand that the foundation for realizing aggressive conspiracies is being eliminated under the conditions that most countries in the East are pursuing peaceful policies. Therefore, they stubbornly attempt to undermine the unity of the peoples of Eastern countries in the struggle against imperialism and to undermine the independent policies of countries that have freed themselves from colonial oppression.

The fact that the instigators and organizers of the Central Treaty—the United States and Britain—did not attend the meeting of Central Treaty Organization countries in Lahore also did not escape the attention of observers. It is believed that this is an attempt by the leadership groups of these two countries to temporarily hide behind the scenes in order to create the illusion that the "initiators" of the new anti-communist conspiracy are the Middle Eastern countries themselves. The strategists of aggressive policies are clearly worried that if the United States and Britain openly act as the leaders of the new "anti-communist alliance," it will open the eyes of the peoples of Eastern countries and make them see the colonialist essence of this imperialist trick.

    警惕和平敌人在东方的阴谋
    塔斯社评论员揭露东南亚条约组织集团和中央条约
    组织集团正在美英幕后操纵下加剧国际紧张局势
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科25日讯：塔斯社评论员叶戈罗夫写道：东南亚条约组织和中央条约组织军事政治集团头目们正在努力使这两个被人民唾弃的侵略集团大肆活动起来。不久前东南亚条约组织在拉合尔举行的“讨论会”的参加者还没来得及离开，参加中央条约组织军事集团的三个中东国家（巴基斯坦、伊朗和土耳其）的首脑会议就在那里开始了。伊朗的“早安报”把在拉合尔举行的这两个会议直接联系起来。报纸写道，在中央条约组织的成员国——伊斯兰教国家首脑会议上，“将就在亚洲建立反共同盟的问题交换意见，并将研究在东南亚条约组织成员国会议上提出的解决这个问题的方法。”另一家伊朗报纸“观察报”写道，在会谈过程中将讨论关于东南亚条约组织和中央条约组织在同“共产主义进行斗争”方面统一行动的问题。
    这些消息在东方的国家里引起了可以理解的不安，因为，那里的人们非常了解，殖民主义者每当准备侵害人民的自由和独立时，总是要搬出“共产主义危险”来吓唬人的。
    叶戈罗夫写道，在我们时代里掀起反共狂，其目的是要加剧国际紧张局势和阻挠在各国关系中所出现的紧张局势的缓和。在“反共联盟”这块招牌下，侵略政策的鼓吹者企图把东方那些不属于任何一个现有条约的国家拖入军事集团的罗网里。冷战维护者们明白，在东方大多数国家执行和平政策的条件下，实现侵略阴谋诡计的基础正在消灭。因此，他们就顽固地企图破坏东方各国人民在同帝国主义斗争中的团结一致，破坏摆脱了殖民主义压迫的国家的独立政策。
    中央条约的鼓吹者和组织者——美国和英国没有出席中央条约组织国家在拉合尔举行的会议，这个事实也逃不过观察家们的注意。人们认为，这是这两个国家的领导集团企图暂时躲在背后以便造成一种假象，似乎新的反共阴谋的“发起人”是中东国家自己。侵略政策的策略家们显然担心，美国和英国如果作为新“反共联盟”的领导人公开活动，将会使东方各国人民打开眼睛，看清这个帝国主义诡计的殖民主义的实质。
