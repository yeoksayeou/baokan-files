    To launch mass technical innovation and technological revolution movements is the broad road for all enterprises in our country to continue to leap forward. Modernized large-scale enterprises are the backbone of socialist enterprises and occupy a pivotal position in the entire industrial production. The important equipment needed for capital construction and the important products needed for industrial and agricultural production are mostly produced by large-scale enterprises. Therefore, in all large-scale modern enterprises, supporting the technical innovation and technological revolution initiatives of the masses of workers, and continuously summarizing and promoting new technologies and new experiences created by the masses of workers, must be taken as the most important task.
    Some people think that modernized large-scale enterprises have relatively advanced technology and equipment, and there is not much "oil" to be squeezed out of technical innovation and technological revolution. This view is incorrect. The scope of technical innovation and technological revolution is very wide. In addition to the reform of equipment and tools, there are also the reform of technology, the reform of production methods, the reform of product design, the trial production of new products, the reform of raw materials, the comprehensive utilization of raw materials, and so on. These reforms are very important for large-scale enterprises to improve labor productivity. Modernized large-scale enterprises shoulder very important tasks, and their technology and equipment are advanced. Therefore, the requirements for technical innovation and technological revolution are not lower, but should be higher.
    It is not only necessary for modernized large-scale enterprises to carry out technical innovation and technological revolution, but also have great potential. Even in enterprises, workshops, and processes with completely new equipment, the field for technical innovation and technological revolution is very broad. The seamless steel tube plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company is a modern factory equipped with the latest equipment. In 1958, the workers of this factory promoted the spirit of continuous revolution, launched a mass technical revolution, and, without basically increasing equipment, the plant's output of seamless steel tubes increased by nearly 100% compared with 1957. In 1959, the workers of this factory continued to launch a mass technical revolution, and the output of seamless steel tubes had another great leap forward compared with 1958. Changchun No. 1 Automobile Factory is also a modern factory equipped with completely new equipment and technology. Its original design capacity was 50 vehicles per shift (one shift produces 50 "Liberation" brand automobile parts in eight hours). During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the workers of the entire factory exerted their energy, broke down superstitions, and carried out comprehensive technical reforms on equipment, technology, and product design. In just over half a month, the entire factory did not ask the state for any investment, nor did it add any equipment, and doubled its production capacity, that is, 100 vehicles per shift. In 1959, they continued to carry out comprehensive technical innovation and technological revolution on the basis of 100 vehicles per shift. Now, the equipment capacity of most of the plant has reached or exceeded 150 vehicles per shift, of which nearly 30% of the production equipment capacity has reached 250 vehicles per shift, which is five times the original design capacity. There are many, many such examples. Since these enterprises equipped with top-notch modern equipment and technology can transform one factory into several factories through launching technical innovation and technological revolution, and can double their output and labor efficiency, modern enterprises with relatively poor equipment and technology are even more likely to continuously improve their production level through technical innovation and technological revolution. This is also the case. In many key iron and steel enterprises in our country, the average utilization coefficient of blast furnaces and open hearth furnaces has increased several times compared with 1952 due to the continuous innovation of smelting technology and the reform of smelting equipment by the masses of workers. Therefore, no matter how advanced the equipment and technology are, we must promote the communist style of daring to think and act, and constantly replace the relatively low-efficiency technology and equipment with more efficient technology and equipment, and replace the production methods that consume more labor time and raw materials with production methods that save more labor time and raw materials, and continuously improve labor efficiency. Only in this way can our enterprises continuously and steadily increase production without basically increasing state investment and without increasing workers.
    To advance towards continuous and automated production, to adopt new scientific achievements and advanced technologies in terms of technological methods, production methods, and product design, to expand varieties, and to vigorously carry out the comprehensive utilization of raw materials, etc., is an important task of technical innovation and technological revolution in modernized large-scale enterprises. In addition, it is also a problem that many modernized large-scale enterprises urgently need to solve in technical innovation and technological revolution to vigorously promote mechanization or semi-mechanization in auxiliary departments, auxiliary workshops, and individual workshops and processes in production departments, and to reduce manual operations as much as possible. In modernized large-scale enterprises, generally speaking, the equipment is relatively advanced, but the technical conditions of various departments, workshops, and processes within the enterprise are also uneven. The equipment technology of auxiliary departments and auxiliary workshops is generally relatively poor, the degree of mechanization is relatively low, and some are even completely manual operations. For example, in the transportation departments of many enterprises, crane workers, loading and unloading workers, and handling workers quite commonly exist who push, pull, carry, and lift. Even individual processes and types of work in production departments and production workshops, such as foundry workers and assembly workers in the machinery industry, coal miners in the coal industry, packaging workers in light industrial enterprises, etc., have not completely broken away from manual operations in many modern enterprises. These processes, due to their relatively backward technical conditions, not only occupy a lot of labor, but also often become weak links in production development. The production of modern enterprises is continuous, and if auxiliary departments and auxiliary workshops cannot keep up, and individual types of work and processes cannot keep up, the production of the entire enterprise cannot leap forward. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly change the phenomenon of backward technology in auxiliary departments and auxiliary workshops, so that all departments of the enterprise carry out technical innovation and technological revolution to achieve mechanized and semi-mechanized production.
    The key to carrying out technical innovation and technological revolution in modernized large-scale enterprises lies in adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, implementing the policy of combining foreign and indigenous methods, combining large, medium, and small sizes, and launching mass movements in a big way. Some comrades believe that in large-scale enterprises with relatively advanced equipment and technical conditions and a relatively high degree of mechanization, it is not very "glorious" to use simple mechanical equipment, so they are not very interested. This view is incorrect. Because since manual or semi-manual operations still exist in modern enterprises, it is a great progress to replace manual operations with simple mechanical equipment. The coexistence of simple mechanical equipment with mechanized and automated equipment should be said to be much more "glorious" than the coexistence of manual operations with mechanized and automated equipment. It is true that the most ideal is to adopt the latest technology, and those who have the conditions must actively adopt it. We should have this ambition and aspiration, but we must also proceed from specific material and technical conditions. We should use foreign methods if we can, and if we cannot, we should first use indigenous and simple methods, and move forward step by step. Although the efficiency of indigenous and simple mechanical equipment is not as high as that of modern mechanical equipment, it is easier to manufacture and master, and therefore easier to achieve results. The reason why enterprises such as Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant, Harbin Bearing Plant, Dalian Machine Tool Plant, and Luoyang Bearing Plant can quickly produce automatic production lines and double labor efficiency is mainly because they rely on the masses and use simple equipment. Therefore, in the process of carrying out the technical innovation and technological revolution movement, it is necessary to implement the policy of "walking on two legs": combining foreign methods and indigenous methods, combining large and small sizes, combining state investment and self-reliance, combining manufacturing new equipment and transforming old equipment, combining continuously adopting new technologies and improving workers' operating skills, combining self-creation and invention with promoting others' advanced experience, combining the reform of local operating methods with the reform of the entire technological process, and combining the reform of product parts and components with the reform of the entire product structure. Only in this way can we fully utilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses of workers, and only in this way can we form a vigorous mass movement.
    The technical operations of modern enterprises are relatively complex, and the connection between the front, rear, left, and right processes is very close. If there is a problem with any process, it will affect the production of the entire enterprise. Therefore, in the mass technical innovation and technological revolution movement, we must combine the communist style of daring to think and act with the scientific analysis of seeking truth from facts. On the one hand, we must not be bound by the technology and conclusions of our predecessors, and we must dare to create new technologies and new experiences. On the other hand, we must pay attention to scientific experiments. Whether it is a local reform or a complete reform, whether it is self-creation or the promotion of other people's creative achievements, we must conduct scientific experiments. Especially for major technical reforms, we must repeatedly conduct scientific experiments and gradually promote them after gaining experience.
    Modernized large-scale enterprises have more engineering and technical personnel and technically skilled workers with rich practical experience. As long as the party organizations of the enterprises strengthen leadership, adhere to the principle of putting politics in command, launch mass movements in a big way, and implement the policy of combining leading cadres, workers, and technical personnel, they will certainly be able to make outstanding achievements in technical innovation and technological revolution, and they will certainly be able to achieve a better, comprehensive, and continued leap forward in 1960 on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959.

### 现代化企业也必须革新技术

    现代化企业也必须革新技术
    开展群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，是我国所有企业继续跃进的康庄大道。现代化大型企业是社会主义企业的骨干，在整个工业生产中占有举足轻重的地位。基本建设所需要的重要设备，工农业生产所需要的重要产品，大都是大型企业生产的。因此，在一切大型的现代化的企业中，必须把支持职工群众的技术革新和技术革命的创举，把不断地总结和推广职工群众创造的新技术、新经验，作为一项最重要的任务。
    有人以为，现代化大型企业的技术和设备比较先进，技术革新和技术革命没有什么油水。这种看法是不对的。技术革新和技术革命的范围很广，除了设备工具的改革以外，工艺的改革、生产方法的改革、产品设计的改革、试制新产品、原料材料的改革、综合利用原料材料等等都是。这些改革，对大型企业提高劳动生产率是非常重要的。现代化大型企业担负的任务十分重大，它们技术和设备又是先进的，所以技术革新和技术革命的要求不是较低而是应该更高。
    现代化大型企业进行技术革新和技术革命，不仅有必要，而且潜力很大。即使是设备全新的企业、车间和工序，技术革新和技术革命的园地也是广阔得很。鞍钢无缝钢管厂就是一个用最新的设备装备起来的现代化工厂。这个厂的职工在1958年发扬不断革命精神，群众大闹技术革命，全厂在基本上不增加设备的情况下，无缝钢管产量比1957年增加了将近一倍。1959年，这个厂的职工群众继续大闹技术革命，无缝钢管产量又比1958年有很大的跃进。长春第一汽车厂也是一个以全新设备、全新技术装备起来的现代化工厂。它的原设计能力是班产五十辆（一个班在八小时内生产五十辆解放牌汽车部件）。在1958年的大跃进中，全厂职工鼓足干劲，破除迷信，对设备、工艺和产品设计进行全面的技术改革，仅仅半个多月的时间，全厂没有向国家要一文投资，没有增加一台设备，就使生产能力翻一番，即班产一百辆。1959年他们又在班产一百辆的基础上，继续进行全面的技术革新和技术革命。现在，全厂大部分设备能力都已经达到或者超过了班产一百五十辆，其中近30％的生产设备能力达到了班产二百五十辆，达到原设计能力的五倍。这样的例子很多很多。既然这些用头等现代设备和技术装备起来的企业，通过大闹技术革新和技术革命，都能够变一厂为数厂，都能够成倍提高产量和劳动效率，设备和技术比较差的现代企业，就更有可能通过技术革新和技术革命不断地提高生产水平。事实也正是这样的。我国不少重点钢铁企业，由于职工群众不断革新冶炼技术和改革冶炼设备，高炉平炉平均利用系数比1952年有成倍的提高。因此，无论设备技术怎样先进，我们都要发扬敢想敢干的共产主义风格，不断地以效率更高的技术和设备代替效率比较低的技术和设备，以更加节约劳动时间和节约原材料的生产方法代替比较费劳动时间和原材料的生产方法，不断地提高劳动效率。只有这样，我们的企业才能在基本上不增加国家投资、不增加工人的条件下，使生产持续地稳定地上升。
    向生产连续化、自动化进军，在工艺方法、生产方法和产品设计方面采用新的科学成就和先进技术，扩大品种，大搞原料材料的综合利用等等，这是现代化大型企业技术革新和技术革命的一个重要任务。除此之外，在辅助部门、辅助车间以及生产部门的个别车间和工序，大搞机械化或半机械化，尽可能地减少手工操作，也是许多现代化大型企业在技术革新和技术革命中急需解决的一个问题。在现代化大型企业中，总的说来，设备是比较先进的，但是，在企业内部各个部门、车间和工序的技术条件，也是参差不齐的。辅助部门和辅助车间的设备技术一般都比较差，机械化程度比较低，有的甚至完全是手工操作。例如不少企业内运输部门的起重工人、装卸工人、搬运工人，就相当普遍地存在着推、拉、扛、背等现象。就是生产部门和生产车间的个别工序、工种，例如机械工业中的铸造工人、装配工人，煤炭工业的攉煤工人，轻工业企业的包装工人等等，在许多现代化企业里也没有完全脱离手工操作。这些工序由于技术条件比较落后，不但占用着很多的劳动力，而且常常成为生产发展中的薄弱环节。现代企业的生产是连续的，辅助部门和辅助车间跟不上去，个别工种和工序跟不上去，整个企业的生产就不能跃进。因此，必须迅速改变辅助部门和辅助车间技术落后的现象，使企业的一切部门进行技术革新和技术革命，实现机械化、半机械化生产。
    在现代化大型企业里开展技术革新和技术革命，关键在于坚持政治挂帅，贯彻执行洋土结合、大中小结合的方针，大搞群众运动。有的同志认为，在设备技术条件比较先进、机械化程度比较高的大型企业里，采用简易机械设备不很“光采”，因而兴趣不大。这种看法是不对的。因为现代化企业里既然还存在着手工操作或半手工操作，那么，用简易的机械设备代替手工操作，就是很大的进步。简易机械设备与机械化、自动化设备并存，比起手工操作与机械化、自动化设备并存，应该说是“光采”得多了。不错，最理想的是采用最新的技术，凡是有条件的都必须积极采用。我们应该有这种雄心大志，但是我们又要从具体的物质技术条件出发，能搞洋的就搞洋的，不能搞洋的就先搞土的、简易的，一步一步地往前走。土的、简易的机械设备，虽然效率比不上现代化的机械设备高，但比较容易制造、容易掌握，因而也容易见效。哈尔滨量具刃具厂、哈尔滨轴承厂、大连机床厂、洛阳轴承厂等企业，所以能很快地制成生产自动线，成倍地提高劳动效率，主要的也是依靠群众，用简易设备搞起来的。因此，在开展技术革新和技术革命运动的过程中，必须贯彻执行“两条腿走路”的方针：洋法和土法结合，大型和中小型结合，国家投资和自力更生结合，制造新设备和改造旧设备结合，不断采用新技术和提高工人的操作水平结合，自己创造发明和推广别人的先进经验结合，局部操作方法的改革和整个工艺过程的改革结合，产品零件部件的改革和整个产品结构的改革结合。这样，才能充分地发挥职工群众的积极性和创造性，才能形成声势浩大的群众运动。
    现代企业的技术操作比较复杂，前后左右工序的连系又很密切，任何一个工序出了问题，都会影响到整个企业的生产。所以在群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动中，一定要把敢想敢干的共产主义风格和实事求是的科学分析相结合。一方面，不受前人的技术和定论所束缚，要敢于创造新技术、新经验，另一方面，要重视科学试验。不论是局部的改革还是全部的改革，不论是自己创造还是推广别人的创造成果，都要进行科学试验，特别是重大的技术改革，更要反复地进行科学试验，取得经验以后，再逐步推广。
    现代化大型企业拥有较多的工程技术人员和富有实践经验的技术工人，只要企业的党组织加强领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，贯彻执行领导干部、工人群众和技术人员三结合的方针，就一定能够使现代化企业在技术革新和技术革命方面做出卓越的成绩来，就一定能够在1958和1959两年大跃进的基础上，实现1960年更好的全面的继续跃进。
