Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, February 27th: Workers of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company responded to the initiative of Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, guaranteeing to complete the first quarter production plan ahead of schedule and prepare for a sustained leap forward in the second quarter, becoming a vanguard in the new steel production upsurge.

The workers of the open-hearth furnace workshop, who completed their February plan ahead of schedule at noon today, decided to take it to the next level in March, guaranteeing to complete the first quarter production plan four days ahead of schedule, and to grasp both production and preparation to ensure continued leap forward in the second quarter. The workers of the large open-hearth furnace plant, which has already increased steel production by more than 2,000 tons in the first fifty-eight days of this year, guarantee to complete the first quarter steel production plan seven days ahead of schedule, and to achieve an average smelting time of seven hours per furnace. Workers at the large rolling mill also proposed to complete the first quarter production plan three days ahead of schedule, with a steel quality reaching 98.5%, and to strictly guarantee production according to variety and specification.

Since February, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company has encountered some new problems in production, such as the new conversion of the converter plant to hot-blast alkaline iron-making furnaces, workers' unfamiliarity with operation, poor quality of raw coal, and frequent slagging of gas furnaces. Since the second half of February, the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's Party Committee, in response to these key issues, launched a mass technical innovation campaign. Many leading cadres from the company to various factories went deep into the most critical areas to work with the workers, analyze the reasons for the key problems, and propose solutions. Steel production in the second ten days of the month increased by 24% compared with the first twenty days, and quality also improved significantly. The Party Committee Secretary of the Liujiaba Converter Plant, after planting "experimental plots" in the iron-making furnace to address the key issue of short iron-making furnace life, found that there were problems with the furnace blowing quality. He focused on this link, greatly improving the life of the iron-making furnace. Now the average life of the iron-making furnace in the whole plant has increased from the past one or two days to more than three days. By overcoming a series of weak links, this plant achieved a double leap forward in high yield and high quality in February. Gas furnace slagging is one of the most critical problems in the small open-hearth furnace workshop. After the workshop's general branch secretary led a branch secretary from a gas worker background to plant "experimental plots" in the gas furnace, they discovered problems such as incomplete operating procedures and inconsistent operations among the three shifts. They worked with the workers to develop a complete set of operating procedures and unified operating thinking, which greatly improved the quality of the gas furnace and basically eliminated the phenomenon of slagging.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, February 27th: Workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company responded to the initiative of workers of Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, determined to complete the production plan of steel and steel products in the first quarter ahead of schedule, and strive to increase the average daily production level of pig iron in March by 60% compared with February, laying the foundation for a better leap forward in the second quarter.

The production plans for steel, steel products, and pig iron of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company in the first quarter of this year have all increased significantly compared with the same period last year. When discussing the response to the initiative of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, this company further proposed specific measures to achieve the production plan ahead of schedule. Their measures are to continue to improve the political awareness of workers, mobilize workers to launch a production upsurge to fight a big battle in March; promote advanced experience as a whole set. While promoting the advanced experience of brother factories, the effective experience of their own enterprises should also be applied to production as a whole set, combining the promotion of advanced experience with mass technical innovation. They also proposed a series of measures in terms of saving raw materials, realizing mechanization of transportation and loading and unloading, and eliminating accidents.

Entering February, the workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company enthusiastically launched a skill competition movement to catch up with the advanced level of the country. The workers of the whole plant are in high spirits and full of energy, and the production level is constantly rising. From February 1st to 26th, the output of various major products increased compared with the same period in January, with steel increasing by 3.2%, steel products increasing by 4.4%, and pig iron increasing by 33.2%. The Second Rolling Mill has completed the February plan ahead of schedule and started preparing for production in March. (Attached picture)

    钢铁战线掀起新的竞赛高潮
    重钢太钢热烈响应石钢倡议
    决心提前完成首季计划作好第二季度跃进准备
    新华社重庆27日电　重庆钢铁公司职工响应北京石景山钢铁公司的倡议，保证提前完成第一季度生产计划，做好第二季度持续跃进的准备工作，在新的钢铁生产高潮中作一名急先锋。
    在今天中午提前完成2月份计划的小平炉车间职工，决定在3月份更上一层楼，保证提前四天完成第一季度生产计划，并且作到既抓生产又抓准备，保证第二季度生产继续跃进。今年前五十八天已经增产了二千多吨钢的大平炉厂职工，保证提前七天完成第一季度产钢计划，每炉的平均熔炼时间要达到七小时。大型轧钢厂职工也提出要提前三天完成第一季度生产计划，钢材质量达到98．5％，而且严格保证按品种按规格生产。
    2月份以来，重庆钢铁公司在生产中遇到了一些新的问题，如转炉厂新改热风碱性化铁炉，职工操作不熟悉，原煤质量不好，煤气炉经常结渣等。2月下半月以来，重钢党委针对这些关键问题，发动群众大闹技术革新，从公司到各厂许多领导干部都深入最关键的地方与职工一起劳动，分析关键存在的原因，提出解决的办法。下旬的钢产量比前二十天上升了24％，质量也有很大提高。刘家坝转炉厂的党委书记针对化铁炉寿命短的关键在化铁炉种“试验田”后，发现吹炉质量有问题，他抓紧了这一环，使化铁炉的寿命大大提高，现在全厂化铁炉的寿命平均已由过去的一、两天提高到三天以上。这个厂由于克服了一连串薄弱环节，在2月份实现了高产、优质双跃进。煤气炉结渣是小平炉车间最关键的问题之一，车间总支书记带着一个煤气工人出身的支部书记在煤气炉种“试验田”后，发现操作规程不健全、三班操作不统一等问题，他们就与工人共同研究，订出一套完整的操作制度，统一了操作思想，煤气炉的质量就大大好转，结渣的现象已基本消灭。
    新华社太原27日电　太原钢铁公司职工响应北京石景山钢铁公司职工的倡议，决心提前完成第一季度钢和钢材的生产计划，并且力争3月份使生铁的平均日产水平比2月份提高60％，为第二季度更好地跃进打下基础。
    太原钢铁公司今年第一季度钢、钢材和生铁的生产计划，都比去年同期有很大增长。这个公司在讨论响应石景山钢铁公司的倡议时，进一步提出了提前实现生产计划的具体措施。他们的措施是继续提高职工的政治觉悟，发动职工开展一个大战3月份的生产高潮；成套地推广先进经验，在推广兄弟厂的先进经验的同时，对本企业的行之有效的经验，也要成套地运用到生产中去，把推广先进经验和大闹技术革新结合起来。在节约原材料、实现运输装卸机械化和消灭事故等方面，他们也都提出了一系列的措施。
    进入2月，太原钢铁公司职工热烈开展了赶上全国先进水平的比武竞赛运动。全厂职工斗志昂扬，干劲冲天，生产水平不断上升，2月1日到26日，各种主要产品产量与1月份同期比较，钢增长3．2％，钢材增长4 ．4％，生铁增长了33．2％，第二轧钢厂已提前完成了2月份的计划，开始为3月份生产作准备。（附图片）
