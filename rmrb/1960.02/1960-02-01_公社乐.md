    Commune Joy
    Liu Yong
	
	Fish Leap in the Lake Behind the Boat
	Shuangbian Lake, water connecting to the sky,
	Fishing boats on the lake are like flying swallows,
	Some fishing boats come from the horizon,
	Some spread their wings and fly into the sky.
	Women row, men cast nets,
	Fish like snowflakes fly into the hold,
	Fresh fish fill the hold, songs fill the lake,
	The lake water is so happy that waves chase after waves.
	Magpies sing in the trees by the lake.
	Commune members happily turn their heads while rowing,
	The waves in front quickly give way,
	Carp leap all over the lake behind the boat.
	
	Reading and Singing Under the Lamp
	The reservoir is built halfway up the mountain,
	Endless water at a glance,
	A water belt flows at will,
	Machines are installed beside the aqueduct.
	The generator rumbles,
	Electric lights in the village shine brightly,
	Reading and singing under the lamp:
	Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party!
	
	Apples Nod and Smile
	Driving the sheep up the mountain peaks,
	Like white clouds flying in the sky,
	In previous years, the mountains were full of weeds,
	Now the mountains are covered with red apples;
	Singing mountain songs under the trees,
	Apples continuously bump against foreheads,
	Wanting to pick one to taste,
	Seeing the red scarf around the neck,
	Touching the apple and letting go again,
	Apples nod and smile.
	
	Ducks and Geese Float All Over the River, Gha Gha
	Lian River water, shimmering silver,
	Lian River Commune has many poultry,
	Standing on the riverbank to take a look,
	Ducks and geese float all over the river, gha gha.

    公社乐
    刘勇船后鲤鱼满湖跳双边湖，水连天，湖里渔船像飞燕，有的渔船天边来，有的展翅飞上天。女划桨，男撒网，鱼像雪花飞进仓，鲜鱼满仓歌满湖，湖水喜得浪赶浪。湖边树上喜鹊叫。社员划船喜回头，前面波浪忙让路，船后鲤鱼满湖跳。灯下读书又唱歌水库修在半山上，一望无边水汪汪，一条水带随意流，机器装在水圳旁。发电机呀轰隆隆，村里电灯亮堂堂，灯下读书又唱歌：万岁毛主席！万岁共产党！苹果点头笑盈盈赶起羊儿上山峰，好似天上飞白云，往年山上草丛丛，如今苹果漫山红；唱起山歌树下过，苹果连连碰额门，想要摘个尝一尝，望见颈上红领巾，摸摸苹果又松手，苹果点头笑盈盈。鸭鹅呷呷浮满河涟河水，泛银波，涟河公社家禽多，站在河岸打一望，鸭鹅呷呷浮满河。
