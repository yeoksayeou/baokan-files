    Soviet "Red Star" Comments on Allen Dulles' Speech
    The United States is Stepping Up Anti-Soviet Espionage Activities
    The Soviet People Must Maintain Vigilance at All Times Under Any Circumstances
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Soviet "Red Star" published an observer's commentary on January 31, commenting on the speech made by Allen Dulles, Director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, at a banquet held at the New York Aviation Academy on January 26.

    The commentary pointed out that Allen Dulles, filled with fear for the future, vigorously promoted the entire plan to strengthen anti-Soviet espionage activities. The commentary wrote that Allen Dulles openly stated, "Our job is to judge the extent of Soviet rocket technology and other military aspects, and what it will be in the near future." He said that Americans are particularly concerned about how much potential the Soviet Union has for producing rockets, what the current Soviet rocket reserves are, etc., and that this intelligence "is of extremely important significance to our plans."

    As for how to obtain this intelligence, the commentary pointed out that, according to Allen Dulles himself, American intelligence agencies have been collecting Soviet intelligence for forty years, and this intelligence cannot be obtained by computers, but by living things—well-trained, experienced spies. The commentary pointed out that Allen Dulles, nearly sixty-seven years old, has been engaged in espionage activities for about forty years. He is the "eyes and ears" of the United States, and his vast intelligence agency spends hundreds of millions of dollars every year.

    The commentary pointed out that Allen Dulles' programmatic speech (i.e., the remarks calling for anti-Soviet espionage activities) has alerted us. The number one American spy would not crawl out of his cave for nothing. The Soviet Union's growing strength and the welcome warming of the international climate frightened him. We cannot fail to consider the fact that the head of the U.S. intelligence agency, in his speech, essentially demanded the intensification of anti-Soviet war preparations. Dulles is slandering our country, attempting to defame our peaceful policies, especially the recent resolution on reducing the Soviet armed forces. The Soviet Union's reduction of its forces convincingly proves that the Soviet Union is peace-loving. While the ice floe is still temporarily intact, Dulles has become so nervous that he hurriedly used this piece of "Cold War" ice to send his espionage lackeys here.

    The commentary concluded by pointing out that Allen Dulles' attempts will not succeed. The commentary said that Mr. Dulles has forgotten that the Soviet people, in addition to having an army equipped with the best rockets in the world, also have vigilance! This is even more powerful than powerful weapons, and we maintain vigilance at all times under any circumstances.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 1st: According to a report by Peter Chew, a reporter for the "Des Moines Register," the U.S. Army has recently trained a special air-sea combat team to carry out sabotage activities behind "enemy lines" in wartime.

    The reporter described the situation of this 316th Special Air-Sea Combat Team, which was formed last summer at Fort Myer, Virginia. The reporter said that the special team's training was conducted under conditions "very close to actual military operations." He wrote: "The special forces have apparently learned night parachuting, landing in pine forests, wading through the swamps of Florida all day, climbing the cliffs of the Rocky Mountains, and practicing landing from landing craft near Little Creek along the Atlantic coast fully armed for a year."

    The reporter said that volunteers participating in this force must agree to serve for six consecutive years and sign a statement saying that they "fully understand that the special forces will be immediately sent behind enemy lines after the start of military operations in order to organize, train, and use guerrilla forces, and fulfill other tasks entrusted to them."

    In addition to organizing and training "guerrilla teams," this force is also responsible for various other sabotage tasks.

### 苏联“红星报”评艾伦·杜勒斯讲话  美国正在加强反苏间谍活动  苏联人民在任何条件下时刻保持警惕性

    苏联“红星报”评艾伦·杜勒斯讲话
    美国正在加强反苏间谍活动
    苏联人民在任何条件下时刻保持警惕性
    本报讯　1月31日苏联“红星报”发表了一篇观察家评论，评美国中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯1月26日在纽约航空学院举行的宴会上的讲话。
    评论指出，艾伦·杜勒斯怀着对未来的恐惧大肆宣扬加强反苏间谍活动的全部计划。评论写道，艾伦·杜勒斯公开声称，“我们的工作是判断苏联火箭技术及其他军事方面达到了什么程度，最近的将来又将如何”。他说，美国人特别关心的是苏联生产火箭的潜力有多大，目前苏联火箭的储备如何等等，这些情报“对我们的计划具有极重大的意义”。
    至于怎样获得这些情报，评论指出，据艾伦·杜勒斯自己讲，美国的谍报机构搜集苏联的情报已有四十年的历史，而这些情报是不能靠计算机得到的，而是要靠活的东西——久经训练的、有经验的间谍。评论指出，艾伦·杜勒斯年近六十七岁，已作了约四十年的间谍活动。他是美国的“耳目”，他那庞大的谍报机构每年要耗费数亿美元。
    评论指出，艾伦·杜勒斯的纲领性讲话（即号召开展反苏间谍活动的言论）使我们警觉起来。头号的美国间谍不会徒劳无益地从自己洞穴里爬出来的。苏联日渐增强的实力和使大家都高兴的这个国际气候转暖的事件把他吓坏了。我们不能不考虑到这样的事实，美国情报机关的魁首在他的讲话里实质上要求加紧反苏的战争准备。杜勒斯是诬蔑我国，试图诽谤我国的和平政策，尤其是诽谤最近的关于裁减苏联武装部队的决议。苏联裁减自己的部队令人信服地证实着苏联是爱好和平的。当冰块暂时还完整的时候，杜勒斯却神经过敏了，以致匆匆忙忙地利用这块“冷战”冰块把自己的间谍走狗派遣到我们这里来。
    评论最后指出，艾伦·杜勒斯的企图是不能得逞的。评论说，杜勒斯先生忘记了，苏联人民除了拥有装备有全世界最好的火箭的军队外，还有警惕性！这甚至于比强大的武器还要厉害，我们在任何的气候条件下都时刻保持警惕性。
    新华社1日讯　纽约消息：据“得梅因纪事报”记者彼得·丘不久前报道，美国陆军训练了一支特别空军陆战队，准备战时在“敌人大后方”进行特务破坏活动。
    记者叙述了这支叫作第三百一十六特别空军陆战队的情形，这支部队是去年夏天在弗吉尼亚州迈尔斯堡组成的。记者说，特别小组的训练是在“非常接近实际军事行动”的条件下进行的。他写道：“特别部队在一年的时间里显然已经学习了夜间跳伞、松林着陆、整天在佛罗里达的沼泽地带跋涉、攀登洛矶山的峭壁和全副武装在大西洋沿岸的小克里克附近练习从登陆艇上登陆”。
    记者说，参加这支部队的志愿者必须同意连续服务六年和在一项声明上签字，这个声明说，他们“完全懂得，特别部队在军事行动开始以后将立刻派往敌人大后方，以便组织、训练和运用游击力量，并履行委托给他们的其他任务”。
    这支部队除了组织和训练“游击队”以外，还负担其他各种破坏任务。
