Xinhua News Agency, February 26th: Workers in the steel factories of Beijing Municipality, spurred by renewed vigor after the Spring Festival, have been extensively carrying out technical innovations and revolutions, promoting advanced experiences, and achieving steadily increasing production. Several factories have already completed their February production plans ahead of schedule.

Immediately after the Spring Festival, both the Beijing Steel Plant and the Special Steel Plant broadly promoted advanced experiences through technical demonstration competitions. The Beijing Steel Plant implemented high-pulling carbon operations. On the basis of guaranteeing the completion of the plan, leading cadres, workers, and technical personnel combined efforts to trial-produce more than ten new steel grades in just over ten days. The Special Steel Plant carried out rapid steelmaking technical demonstration competitions. The average daily output in mid-February was higher than in the first ten days of the month, and the daily production level since the latter part of the month has surpassed that of mid-February. These two factories both exceeded their planned steel output for the first twenty-four days of February by 3%.

The Xuanwu Steel Plant exceeded its total monthly production plan on the 24th. For the first twenty-four days of February, the average daily pig iron output of this plant increased by 11% compared to the same period in January. After the city-wide meeting of heroes, the Xinzhong Steel Plant launched a high tide of learning from and catching up with advanced models. Workers learned from the advanced experience of the Shaling Xinsheng Steel Plant in using large air volume and high blast temperature and carried out technical improvements to the blast furnace. From February 13th to 18th, the average utilization coefficient of the blast furnace increased from 1.5 to 2.45, creating a new record for the entire plant. By the 24th, this factory had also completed its entire monthly plan ahead of schedule and exceeded its targets.

In the technical innovation movement, the production level of the Dahongmen Rolling Mill has soared. Workers designated February as "Safe and High-Yield Month," and innovation competitions were launched between various work sections and groups. Workers in the thin plate workshop created a chain-type automatic feeding machine. In the past, four people per shift were required to take red slabs from the heating furnace and feed them into the rolling mill. Now, only one person is needed to operate the machine, and the red slabs are directly transported from the heating furnace to the rolling mill via a conveying roller table, saving 70,000 man-hours per year. Workers in the section steel workshop also created an automatic conveying roller table, which automatically transports the steel rolled by the rolling mill to the cooling bed, increasing efficiency by 50%, and increasing output from more than six tons per hour to eleven tons. Since the beginning of this year, the entire factory has carried out fifty-six innovations, and the production level has continuously improved. By February 22nd, it had completed its entire monthly production plan seven days ahead of schedule and exceeded its targets by 3.39%. The average daily output of steel from the 1st to the 24th increased by 17.63% compared to the same period in January.

    北京一批钢厂一马当先
    二月生产计划提前完成
    新华社26日讯　北京市属各钢铁工厂的职工，在春节以后大鼓干劲，广泛开展技术革新和技术革命运动，推广先进经验，生产节节上升。好几个工厂已经提前完成了2月份生产计划。
    春节一过，北京钢厂和特殊钢厂都通过技术表演赛，广泛推广先进经验。北京钢厂推行高拉炭操作，在保证完成计划的基础上，领导干部、工人和技术人员三结合，在十多天中试炼出十多种新钢种。特殊钢厂开展快速炼钢技术表演赛，2月中旬平均日产量比上旬高，下旬以来的日产水平又超过了中旬。这两个厂都超额3％完成了2月份前二十四天的钢产量计划。
    宣武钢铁厂在24日超额完成了全月生产计划。2月份前二十四天，这个厂的生铁平均日产量，比1月同期提高11％。新中钢铁厂在全市群英会以后，掀起了学先进赶先进的高潮。工人们学习了沙岭新生钢铁厂大风量高风温的先进经验，进行高炉的技术改造，2月13日到18日，高炉平均利用系数从过去的一点五提高到二点四五，创造了全厂最高纪录。这个厂到24日止，也提前全面超额完成了全月计划。
    在技术革新运动中，大红门轧钢厂生产水平飞跃上升。工人们把2月定为“安全高产月”，各工段、小组之间开展了革新竞赛，薄板车间工人制成了链子式自动上料机，过去每班要四个人从加热炉提出红板坯，往轧钢机里上料，现在只要一个人操纵机器，红板坯就从加热炉直接通过输料滚道进入轧钢机，一年可以节约七万个工时。型钢车间工人也制成了自动输料滚道，使轧钢机轧出的钢材自动运到冷床上，效率提高50％，产量从过去每小时六吨多提高到十一吨。今年以来，全厂已经进行了五十六项革新，生产水平不断提高，到2月22日，就提前七天超额3．39％完成了全月生产计划，1日到24日钢材的平均日产量比1月同期提高17． 63％。
