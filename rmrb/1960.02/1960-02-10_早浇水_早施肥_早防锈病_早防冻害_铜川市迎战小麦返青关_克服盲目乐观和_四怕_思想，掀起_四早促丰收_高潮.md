Early Watering, Early Fertilization, Early Rust Prevention, Early Frost Damage Prevention
Tongchuan City Faces the Wheat Regreening Stage
Overcoming Blind Optimism and "Four Fears," and Launching a "Four Earlies to promote Bumper Harvest" Upsurge

(Our dispatch) The curtain has risen on Tongchuan City, Shaanxi Province, facing the regreening stage of wheat growth. In recent days, more than 100,000 people and 57,000 water carts have been mobilized, irrigating 30,000 mu of wheat fields daily, and striving to complete the second application of fertilizer in the shortest possible time.

The battle drums for wheat overwintering in Tongchuan City have not yet ceased, and specific arrangements have already been made for the battle of the regreening stage. Based on past experience and this year's new characteristics, the Municipal Party Committee divides this year's wheat regreening stage into roughly three phases: before February 5th is the preparation phase; February 5th to 15th is the major battle phase; and February 15th to March 5th is the mop-up, make-up, and preparation phase for attacking the jointing stage.

Two things must be done in the preparation phase: First, for wheat that has not successfully passed the overwintering stage, continue to irrigate and fertilize; Second, organize cadres and commune members to go deep into the fields to check rooting, look at tillering, count seedlings, classify and rank them, and propose specific "four increases" measures and requirements for increasing plants, increasing ears, increasing grains, and increasing weight in the regreening stage; immediately implement the "four guarantees" responsibility system and establish specialized teams where this hasn't been done; and ensure that insufficient fertilizer and tools are prepared completely within the specified time; channel-ending projects should also be completed on schedule. During the major battle of the "regreening stage," all areas are required to achieve "four earlies to promote bumper harvest." The "four earlies" are: early watering for regreening, early application of regreening fertilizer, early prevention of rust disease, and early prevention of frost damage. Large-area high-yield plots are the "locomotives" of a major wheat harvest. All areas are required to achieve "ten assurances in high-yield plots" (political and ideological work assured in the plot, cadre leadership assured in the plot, scientific research assured in the plot, meteorological work assured in the plot, competition assured in the plot, pig farms assured in the plot, fixed labor assured in the plot, double water conservancy insurance assured in the plot, technical guidance assured in the plot, and tool repair assured in the plot), and carry out a five-level high-yield movement of "three (300 jin per mu), five (500 jin per mu), six (600 jin per mu), eight (800 jin per mu), and thousand (1000 jin per mu) jin." In the later stage of wheat regreening, the masses will be organized again for a major inspection and comparison, checking and comparing each other. All those who have not passed the regreening stage will continue to make up for missed work, striving for all wheat to successfully pass the regreening stage.

Before arranging the work for the major battle of the regreening stage, the Tongchuan Municipal Party Committee first summarized the experience of last year's wheat in passing the overwintering and regreening stages, educating cadres to overcome various kinds of erroneous thinking. Prior to this, many comrades here had different views on striving for a bumper summer harvest this year, which can be summarized as "blind optimism" and "four fears." The former mainly consisted of being satisfied that this year's wheat was well sown, all fertilizer was applied, all irrigated areas were watered, and rust-affected areas were treated, so it was concluded that all wheat had successfully passed the overwintering stage; some even believed that a bumper harvest could be achieved without further fertilization, watering, and processing. The "four fears" were: early attention to the regreening stage would lead to fear of wheat lodging, fear of rust damage, fear of frost damage, and fear of excessive growth. Based on the above situation, some responsible comrades of the Municipal Party Committee successively went to six points in the Liuqu, Fuping, and Zhuangli communes, and went to the fields with commune and team cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers to check and calculate the number of lateral roots of wheat and the degree of tight adhesion with the soil; check and calculate the depth of wheat roots; check and calculate the expansion capacity of wheat roots; check and calculate the size of tillering nodes; and check and calculate the number of tillers. The results of the checks and calculations showed that: the lateral roots of first- and second-class seedlings were tightly integrated with the soil, forming a huge lateral root system; the average tillering was three to four or more, and the tillering nodes were strong; first-class fields had 500,000 to 1 million plants per mu, and second-class fields had 400,000 to 600,000 plants. However, the average tillering of third-class seedlings in these points was between one and two, and some had not yet tillered, and the wheat seedlings were yellow and thin. Judging from the rooting, tillering, and number of seedlings in the overwintering stage, the first-class seedlings successfully passed the overwintering stage, the second-class seedlings basically broke through the overwintering stage, and the third-class seedlings had not yet passed the overwintering stage. The facts educated the masses and corrected the idea of blind optimism.

In order to educate cadres and the masses to recognize the benefits of grasping the regreening stage early, responsible comrades of the Municipal Party Committee also summarized the experience of last year's wheat in passing the regreening stage. Last year, all wheat that was watered early for regreening, fertilized early for regreening, and prevented rust early did not lodge or suffer from rust damage; early processing and special treatment were given to third-class seedlings, and third-class seedlings quickly upgraded. The Municipal Party Committee analyzed and studied the investigated materials. Because the facts were specific and the reasoning was sufficient, everyone was convinced. Those who originally said that all wheat had successfully passed the overwintering stage admitted that their views were incorrect; those who originally had "four fears" also said with full confidence: as long as we grasp the regreening stage early, we can completely change "four reductions in yield" into "four increases in yield." The communes have successively, according to the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee, identified the success of wheat overwintering stage by stage, summarized the experience of last year's regreening stage, and formulated implementation plans for the major battle of the regreening stage in their own communes and teams. The Liuqu Commune immediately mobilized 10,000 laborers, setting off a production upsurge with making up for the overwintering stage and preparing for the major battle of the regreening stage as the main content.

### 早浇水　早施肥　早防锈病　早防冻害  铜川市迎战小麦返青关  克服盲目乐观和“四怕”思想，掀起“四早促丰收”高潮

    早浇水　早施肥　早防锈病　早防冻害
    铜川市迎战小麦返青关
    克服盲目乐观和“四怕”思想，掀起“四早促丰收”高潮
    本报讯　陕西省铜川市迎战返青关的序幕已经揭开。连日来出动十万多人，五万七千辆水车，日灌麦田三万亩，并力争在最短时间内施完二遍肥。
    铜川市郊激战小麦越冬关的战鼓还没有停息，大战返青关的战役已经作出具体部署。根据往年经验和今年新的特点，市委把今年小麦返青关大体分为三个阶段：2月5日前为准备阶段，5日至15日是大战阶段，15日至3月5日是扫尾、补课和准备攻打拔节关阶段。
    准备阶段要做好两件事：一、凡没有胜利渡过越冬关的小麦，继续灌水加肥；二、组织干部社员深入田间，查扎根、看分蘖、算苗数，分类排队，分别提出返青关中增株、增穗、增粒、增重的“四增”具体措施和要求；没有制定“四包”责任制和建立专业队的，马上做好；肥料不足、工具不够的，限期准备齐全；渠道结尾工程也要赶时完工。大战“返青关”期间，要求各地做到“四早促丰收”。“四早”即：早浇返青水，早施返青肥，早防锈病，早防冻害。大面积丰产方是小麦大丰收的“火车头”，要求各地做到“十到丰产方”（政治思想工作到方，干部领导到方，科学研究到方，气象工作到方，对手赛到方，养猪场到方，劳力固定到方，水利双保险到方，技术指导到方，工具修理到方），并开展“三（亩产三百斤）、五（亩产五百斤）、六（亩产六百斤）、八（亩产八百斤）、千（亩产千斤）斤”五级丰产运动。小麦返青后期，再次组织群众大检查大评比，互查互比，凡是没有过返青关的，继续补课，力争全部小麦胜利度过返青关。
    铜川市委在安排大战返青关工作以前，首先总结了去年小麦渡过越冬关和返青关的经验，教育干部克服了各式各样的错误思想。在此以前，这里不少同志对争取今年夏季大丰收存在着不同看法，归纳起来是“盲目乐观”和“四怕”。前者主要是满足于今年小麦种的好，全部追了肥，有灌溉设施的全部浇了水，发生锈病的防治了锈病，因此就断定所有小麦都胜利地过了越冬关；甚至认为不再加肥、加水、加工，也能夺得大丰收。“四怕”是：早抓返青关怕麦子倒伏，怕锈病危害，怕受冻，怕疯长。根据上述情况，市委一些负责同志先后深入到流曲、富平、庄里三个公社的六个点，和社、队干部、技术员、老农一起到田间，查、算麦子侧根多少，与土壤结合紧密程度；查、算麦根深度；查、算麦根的扩展能力；查、算分蘖节大小；查、算分蘖多少。查、算的结果表明：一、二类苗的侧根与土壤紧密结合，形成庞大的侧根系；平均分蘖三个至四个以上，分蘖节粗壮；一类田每亩五十万到一百万株，二类田四十万至六十万株。但是这几个点的三类苗，平均分蘖在一至两个之间，有一部分还没有分蘖，麦苗黄而瘦。根据小麦在越冬关里的扎根、分蘖和苗数来衡量，一类苗胜利渡过了越冬关，二类苗基本上突破了越冬关，三类苗还没有过越冬关。事实教育了群众，纠正了盲目乐观思想。
    为了教育干部、群众认识到早抓返青关的好处，市委负责同志还总结了去年小麦渡过返青关的经验。去年凡是早浇返青水、早施返青肥和早防锈的，麦子都没有倒伏，也没受到锈病的危害；提早给三类苗加工、吃偏饭的，三类苗很快升格晋级。市委把调查到的材料经过分析研究。因为事实具体，道理充分，人人口服心服。原来说小麦全部胜利渡过越冬关的，都承认自己的看法不正确；原来有“四怕”思想的，也信心百倍地说：只要早抓返青关，完全可以变“四减产”为“四增产”。各公社纷纷根据市委指示，逐块鉴定小麦越冬关过得好坏，总结去年返青关经验，制定了本社、本队的大战返青关的实施方案。流曲公社马上出动了万名劳动大军，掀起了给越冬关补课和准备大战返青关为主要内容的生产高潮。
