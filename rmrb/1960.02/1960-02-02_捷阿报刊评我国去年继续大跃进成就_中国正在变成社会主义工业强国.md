Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 31st. Several Czechoslovakian newspapers published articles commenting on our country's continued Great Leap Forward achievements last year.

    The "Red Right Newspaper" published an article by its Beijing correspondent, Marek, on January 31st, titled "A Year of Continued Leap Forward." The article stated that the recent press communique published by China regarding the development of the national economy in 1959 clearly demonstrates that last year in China was a year of continued leap forward and a year of rapid socialist construction.

    The article summarized the conclusions made by Chinese newspapers regarding last year's achievements: 1959 proved the correctness and practicality of the General Line of the Chinese Communist Party in building socialism in China. 1959 confirmed that developing the national economy at a Great Leap Forward speed is not only possible but also necessary. 1959 also confirmed the correctness of the People's Communes.

    After listing the figures for the increase in China's steel and coal production in 1959 compared to 1958, the article pointed out that today China's coal production is equivalent to the total coal production of the three capitalist countries of Britain, France, and Japan. The article stated that the fact that industry accounts for more than two-thirds of the total value of industrial and agricultural production in People's China proves the rapid progress of China's industrialization.

    When discussing the achievements of China's agricultural development last year, the article stated that last year, despite one-third of the sown area suffering from severe drought and floods, China still achieved an 8% increase in grain production, which can be described as a revolutionary and historic victory for the Chinese people.

    The article emphasized the necessity of rapidly developing agriculture in China. The article stated that developing pig farming to solve the fertilizer problem for hundreds of millions of hectares of land is currently one of the main links in China's efforts to further develop agricultural production. Striving for the mechanization of industrial and agricultural production is an important feature of China's transformation from a backward country to a modern and developed industrial country.

    The article pointed out that the experience accumulated by the Chinese Communist Party and the working people in the past two years will undoubtedly be an important force for achieving even more outstanding achievements this year.

    The article concluded by saying that the great achievements made by People's China last year are a powerful warning to those who least want to see 680 million Chinese people standing strong. Depriving the Chinese government of its right to speak when solving the most important international issues has long been condemned by world public opinion as an absurd thing. Those who practice "power politics" against the People's Republic of China have not succeeded and cannot solve any pressing problems in Asia.

    The "Agricultural Newspaper" published an editorial on the 29th stating that the second year of China's Great Leap Forward has enabled China to complete and exceed the original targets of the Second Five-Year Plan for 1962 three years ahead of schedule. Therefore, China already possesses the best preconditions for challenging even the largest capitalist countries. The newspaper believes that although some parts of China suffered from prolonged drought or floods in 1959, agricultural production still increased compared to 1958 due to the decisive transition to large-scale production and the further development and consolidation of collective farming.

    The latest issue of the Slovak weekly "Forward" also published an article commenting on the achievements of China's economic development in 1959. The article pointed out that last year was a significant stage in China's transformation into a country with developed industry and modernized agriculture.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, January 31st. The Albanian newspaper "Unity" published an article today entitled "The Great Leap Forward of the Genius Chinese People," commenting on China's early completion of the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan.

    The article stated that the Chinese people are working with unparalleled joy to complete the courageous and bold program put forward by the Chinese Communist Party, and they have completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. This demonstrates the powerful transforming power of the socialist system, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of working people, and China's great strides.

    The article continued that China is increasingly becoming a powerful socialist industrial country. The glorious Chinese Communist Party, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, has formulated a Great Leap Forward plan for building socialism and is successfully implementing this plan. Today, China has become one of the largest countries in the world producing coal and steel. This shows that the power of the people is endless, and this power is developing vigorously and creating miracles.

    The article pointed out that the early completion of the Second Five-Year Plan has further improved China's economy, further improved the people's living conditions, and provided more favorable conditions for socialist construction. The article stated that the achievements of the fraternal Chinese people have caused infinite excitement among the people of socialist countries, and these achievements are a great contribution to consolidating world peace. These achievements are also due to the great internationalist assistance of socialist countries, especially the Soviet Union.

    The article stated that the victory of the Chinese people further demonstrates the international prestige of People's China. China's enemies have now been forced to recognize the great strength of this free, talented, and peace-loving people. China's economic achievements are a vivid manifestation of the Chinese people's great and indomitable will to defend peace. The more consolidated China's economy becomes, the more frantic China's enemies will become, and the easier it will be to bankrupt their sinister plans against China.

    The article concluded by saying that the fraternal Chinese people's early completion of the Second Five-Year Plan is a lofty and selfless example for the Albanian people, who are infinitely concerned about China's great progress, and encourages the Albanian people to complete their tasks. It also further strengthens the fraternal cooperation between our two countries. The friendship between our two peoples is based on the Marxist-Leninist parties of both countries. Our common enemies, the imperialists and the Belgrade revisionists, will never be able to destroy our friendship. The Albanian people wholeheartedly wish the fraternal Chinese people even greater achievements in the great struggle to realize socialist construction and defend Asian and world peace.

    捷阿报刊评我国去年继续大跃进成就
    中国正在变成社会主义工业强国
    新华社布拉格31日电　捷克斯洛伐克一些报刊发表文章，评论我国去年继续大跃进的成就。
    1月31日的“红色权利报”以“继续跃进的一年”为题发表了该报驻北京记者马雷克的文章说，不久前中国发表的关于1959年国民经济发展情况的新闻公报，鲜明地证明了去年在中国是继续跃进的一年，是迅速地建设社会主义的一年。
    文章归纳中国报纸对去年成就所作的论断说：1959年证明了中国共产党在中国建设社会主义的总路线的正确性和现实性。1959年证实了以跃进的高速度发展国民经济不仅是可能的，而且是必要的。1959年还证实了人民公社的正确性。
    文章在列举去年中国钢、煤产量比1958年增长的数字后指出，今天中国的煤产量相当于英国、法国和日本三个资本主义国家煤产量的总和。文章说，在人民中国的工农业生产总值中，工业所占的比重达三分之二以上，这个事实证明中国工业化的迅速进展。
    在谈到中国农业去年的发展成就时，文章说，去年中国在有三分之一的播种面积遭受严重水旱灾的情况下，还获得增产粮食8％的成就，这完全可以称作是中国人民的革命的、历史性的胜利。
    文章着重指出了中国目前强调迅速发展农业的必要性。文章说，发展养猪业以解决数亿公顷土地的肥料问题，是目前中国努力使农业生产获得进一步发展的主要环节之一。争取工农业生产机械化，是中国由落后走向现代化的、发达的工业国家的重要特色。
    文章指出，中国共产党和劳动人民在过去两年来所积累起来的经验无疑地将是今年获得更加卓越的成就的重要力量。
    文章最后说，人民中国在去年所获取的伟大成就，是对那些最不喜欢看见六亿八千万中国人坚强地站起来的人们的有力警告。在解决最重要的国际问题时剥夺中国政府的发言权，早已被世界舆论谴责为荒谬绝伦的事了。对中华人民共和国实行“实力政策”的分子没有得逞，也解决不了亚洲的任何迫切问题。
    “农业报”29日发表社论说，中国大跃进的第二年使得中国能够提前三年完成和超额完成第二个五年计划原订1962年的指标。因此，中国已经具备了向甚至是那些最大的资本主义国家提出挑战的最好的先决条件。这家报纸认为，尽管1959年中国某些地方遭到了长期的干旱或水灾，然而农业生产仍比1958年有了增加，这是由于向大规模生产实行了决定性的过渡，以及集体耕作有了进一步的发展和巩固。
    最新一期斯洛伐克文的“前锋”周刊也发表文章，评论1959年中国经济发展的成就。文章指出，去年是中国在改造成为一个拥有发达的工业和现代化农业的国家的道路上的一个意义重大的发展阶段。
    新华社地拉那31日电　阿尔巴尼亚“团结报”今天发表了题为“天才的中国人民的大跃进”的文章，评论中国提前完成第二个五年计划的主要指标。
    文章说，中国人民以无比欢欣的心情为完成中国共产党提出的勇敢和大胆的纲领而劳动，他们提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标。这说明了社会主义制度的强大改造力量，说明了广大劳动群众的革命热情和中国的巨大步伐。
    文章接着说，中国正在日益变成一个强大的社会主义工业国。以毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党拟订了建设社会主义的大跃进的计划，并且正在顺利地实现着这个计划。今天，中国已经成为世界上生产煤和钢铁最多的大国之一。这说明了人民的力量是无穷无尽的，这个力量正在蓬勃地发展，正在创造着奇迹。
    文章指出，提前完成第二个五年计划，这更加提高了中国的经济，更加改善了人民的生活条件，给社会主义建设提供了更有利的条件。文章说，兄弟的中国人民的成就使社会主义国家人民感到无限的兴奋，这些成就是巩固世界和平的巨大贡献。这些成就的取得，也由于社会主义国家国际主义的巨大援助，特别是苏联的援助。
    文章说，中国人民的胜利更显示出了人民中国所具有的国际威信。中国的敌人现在已被迫承认了这个自由的、天才的和爱好和平的人民的巨大力量。中国的经济成就是中国人民保卫和平的伟大的和不可屈服的意志的生动的表现。中国人民的经济越巩固，中国的敌人就越疯狂，而他们反对中国的阴险计划也就越容易破产。
    文章最后说，兄弟的中国人民提前完成了第二个五年计划，是无限关怀着中国的伟大前进的阿尔巴尼亚人民的崇高的和忘我劳动的榜样，鼓舞着阿尔巴尼亚人民去完成他们的任务。它也更加加强了我们两国兄弟般的合作。我们两国人民的友谊是由两国的马克思列宁主义的政党奠定的。我们共同的敌人帝国主义者和贝尔格莱德修正主义者永远也破坏不了我们的友谊。阿尔巴尼亚人民衷心地预祝兄弟的中国人民在实现社会主义建设和保卫亚洲和世界和平的伟大斗争中取得更加巨大的成就。
