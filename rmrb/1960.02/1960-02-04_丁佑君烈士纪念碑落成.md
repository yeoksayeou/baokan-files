Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, February 3rd: The monument built to honor the unyielding female hero, Martyr Ding Youjun, has recently been completed in the martyr's hometown - Wutongqiao District, Leshan County, Sichuan Province. The inscription on the monument is in the handwriting of Chairman Zhu De.
    Martyr Ding Youjun joined the revolution in January 1950. After graduating from the former Xikang People's Revolutionary University, she was assigned to work in Xichang County. On September 18, 1950, she was killed by bandits while participating in the grain requisition work in the Xichang Yanzhong District. She was only nineteen years old when she sacrificed her life. Martyr Ding Youjun demonstrated the noble qualities of a Communist Youth League member, remaining steadfast and unyielding for the cause of the revolution. At the time of her execution, she shouted, "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" After Martyr Ding Youjun's sacrifice, the Xichang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party posthumously recognized her as a glorious Communist Party member, according to her wishes during her lifetime.
    In order to commemorate Martyr Ding Youjun and commend her heroic deeds, the people of Wutongqiao decided to build a monument in 1957. During the construction process, the Communist Youth League organizations widely publicized the martyr's heroic deeds among the people and launched a voluntary labor campaign among young people to "everyone pitching in to personally build the martyr's monument." The Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory also assigned personnel to create a half-length bronze statue of the martyr for the monument.
    The leaders of the Leshan Prefecture and Leshan County Party and government, the leaders of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, and more than three thousand representatives of the people of Leshan County attended the dedication ceremony. The martyr's mother and sister also attended the dedication ceremony. Ge Jintai, Secretary of the Leshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Bai Shangwu, Deputy Secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, spoke at the meeting. They called on the masses and the broad masses of young people to learn from the noble qualities of Martyr Ding Youjun, remain forever loyal to the cause of the proletariat, and build the motherland into a great socialist power at an early date.

    丁佑君烈士纪念碑落成
    新华社成都3日电　为坚贞不屈的女英雄丁佑君烈士修建的纪念碑，最近已经在烈士的家乡——四川省乐山县五通桥区落成。碑上刻有朱德委员长的亲笔题字。
    丁佑君烈士于1950年1月参加革命，她在原西康人民革命大学毕业后，被分配到西昌县工作。1950年9月18日，她在参加西昌盐中区征粮工作时被土匪杀害，牺牲时年仅十九岁。丁佑君烈士在敌人面前表现了青年团员为革命事业坚贞不屈的高贵品质，就义时还高呼：“中国共产党万岁！”丁佑君烈士牺牲后，中共西昌县委根据她生前的请求，追认她为光荣的共产党员。
    为了纪念丁佑君烈士，表彰她的英雄事迹，五通桥人民1957年决定筹建纪念碑。共青团组织在筹建过程中向人民群众广泛宣传了烈士的英雄事迹，并在青年中开展了“人人动手，亲自修建烈士纪念碑”的义务劳动。重庆建设机床厂还指派人员为纪念碑塑造了烈士的半身铜像。
    参加纪念碑落成典礼的有乐山专区和乐山县党和政府的负责人，共青团四川省委的负责人以及乐山县人民共三千多名代表，烈士的母亲和姐姐也参加了落成典礼。中共乐山县委书记葛金台和共青团四川省委副书记白尚武在会上讲了话。他们号召群众和广大青年学习丁佑君烈士的高贵品质，永远忠实于无产阶级的事业，把祖国早日建设成为一个伟大的社会主义强国。
