Dear friends,

This time, I am very happy to be able to visit liberated China again, thanks to the kind invitation of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude for your warm welcome and for holding such a grand gathering for me.

Although only one year has passed since my first visit to China last February, in this year, China's great construction has made further astonishing leaps forward. The productivity and labor force of the liberated 650 million people have overcome various difficulties and obstacles, and are carrying out China's construction at a speed faster than the most modern jet aircraft. I express my deep respect for China's Great Leap Forward.

On the evening of February 13th, I had the honor of attending the reception held in the Great Hall of the People celebrating the 10th anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and mutual Assistance. This magnificent and beautiful Great Hall of the People, symbolizing China's great construction, was built by the people and is used by the people, playing a role for world peace and friendship between the people of all countries. For this, I sincerely congratulate the Chinese people.

I sincerely hope that China, entering the eleventh year after liberation, will further consolidate the unity of the 650 million people, use its rich experience and incisive theories to further open up a bright future and become the central force for world peace.

	The Chinese people warmly support the Japanese movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs, and the Japanese people are deeply grateful for this.

Dear friends!

The Chinese people have taken various measures to give warm support and assistance to the Japanese movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs. On behalf of the Japanese people engaged in the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the Chinese people.

The Chinese people have also extended a warm hand of sympathy to the Japanese atomic and hydrogen bomb victims. Seven organizations, including the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China, The All-China Youth Federation, the Red Cross Society of China, and the China People's Relief Administration, in the name of the Chinese people, have been donating huge amounts of relief funds to the atomic and hydrogen bomb victims every year since 1955.

Thanks to the warm sympathy of the Chinese people, the Japanese atomic and hydrogen bomb victims have first of all received encouragement in spirit. These precious relief funds are used for medical treatment and living allowances for atomic and hydrogen bomb victims, the construction of welfare facilities for atomic and hydrogen bomb victims in Hiroshima, Nagasaki and Tokyo, assistance to the organization and activities of atomic and hydrogen bomb victim groups, and various other meaningful purposes. On behalf of the Japanese atomic and hydrogen bomb victims, I express my deep gratitude to the Chinese people.

Even after the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet adopted a hostile policy toward China, the Chinese people continued to support and assist the Japanese movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs without change, and gave kind sympathy to the Japanese atomic and hydrogen bomb victims. I express my heartfelt respect and gratitude for the Chinese people's sincere and friendly attitude.

	Changes in the international situation have confirmed the correctness of Chairman Mao Zedong's famous saying that "the East wind prevails over the West wind."

Dear friends!

When I first visited China, at a rally held in Beijing, I gave a speech entitled "The Japanese Movement to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs is the Foundation for Opening Sino-Japanese Relations." In that speech, I reported to you the history of the Japanese movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs. So today I will not repeat these, but would like to report to you on the current situation of the Japanese peace movement and its future trends. But before reporting, I have to talk about the recent changes in the international situation and the domestic situation in Japan.

If I were to summarize it in one sentence, the changes in the international situation have confirmed the correctness of Chairman Mao Zedong's famous saying that "the East wind prevails over the West wind." Various peace forces cooperate with each other and give a heavy blow to the imperialists' war policy. In this way, the international situation has begun to fundamentally change, from the Cold War to peaceful coexistence, from the arms race to complete disarmament.

I just used the phrase "various peace forces." Among them, the socialist countries, where the government and the people are united and working for peace, are the most powerful peace force. The Soviet Union is standing at the forefront of this peace force, and China's Great Leap Forward in recent years has further strengthened this peace force. China's legitimate position in the international community and in the United Nations must be recognized as soon as possible. If this is not done, it will not be possible to achieve peaceful coexistence and complete disarmament. This fact cannot be ignored even by the imperialists.

The national movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism also have extremely important significance as peace forces. The French atomic bomb test in the Sahara, which trampled on world public opinion, will further heighten the peace movement in Asia, Africa, especially in Africa. This April, the Second Asian-African People's Conference will be held in Conakry, Africa. We must see the great significance of this conference and do everything we can to make it a success.

The peace movements of the people in capitalist countries have also become an important part of the peace forces. Recently, the peace movements in the United States and Britain are also rising, and I express my heartfelt welcome to this.

Some imperialists are overwhelmed by these various peace forces and cannot adopt a blatant war policy, and have to adopt a peace policy on the surface. But they are not sincerely giving up their war policy. How can the groups that rely on continuing the Cold War and expanding their military power to seize benefits easily give up their war policy? The contradiction between peace forces and war forces still exists.

	Peace forces must be vigilant against the war forces' hypocritical peace conspiracies, so as not to be deceived by the "jackal reciting scriptures."

When war forces adopt a peace policy on the surface, peace forces must be seriously vigilant. A few days ago, I learned from Mr. Liu Ningyi that there is a Chinese proverb, which is "the jackal reciting scriptures." I think this is indeed a very good proverb, because I often hear "jackals reciting scriptures" too. Marx warned that "religion is opium," but "jackal reciting scriptures" is even more dangerous. I thank the Chinese people for advising us with such a good proverb. We must pay full attention to it so as not to be deceived by the "jackal reciting scriptures."

Dear friends,

As mentioned above, the current international situation is that the peace forces have overwhelmed the war forces. But can this general relationship between peace forces and war forces be immediately applied to the domestic situation in all countries? Unfortunately, it cannot. In some countries, the war forces still have the upper hand and are brutally suppressing the peace forces. West Germany is an example. The peace forces of the world should give strong support and warm assistance to the comrades who are carrying out a heroic struggle under this suppression for the cause of peace.

Like West Germany, Japan occupies an extremely important position politically and militarily in the current international situation. In Japan, a fierce struggle is taking place between the war forces and the peace forces. The issue of revising the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty is the central issue of this struggle.

The Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet colluded with the U.S. government and signed a new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," openly forming a military alliance between Japan and the United States. The formation of this military alliance is primarily to meet the strategic requirements of the United States. The U.S. plan to establish a Northeast Asian military alliance for many years has now been completed by combining the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek, U.S.-Syngman Rhee military alliances and this new Japan-U.S. military alliance. With the establishment of the Japan-U.S. military alliance, Japan will be incorporated into the U.S. nuclear strategy system and become a U.S. military base targeting China, the Soviet Union and various Asian countries.

At the same time, this new Japan-U.S. military alliance is in line with the interests of the Japanese monopoly capital groups that are trying to find a way out by developing military industries and expanding abroad. The Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet represents the interests of this monopoly capital group. The signing of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the revival of Japanese militarism will inevitably lead Japan to nuclear armament and sending troops overseas.

	The Japanese people are determined to crush the Japan-U.S. "security guarantee system" and will not allow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet to escalate the tense situation.

The Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet's policy runs counter to the trend of peaceful coexistence and complete disarmament in the international situation, and violates the Japanese peace constitution that stipulates the renunciation of war. The new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is not at all the "security guarantee" mentioned in the name of this treaty, but on the contrary, will put the Japanese people in the danger of destruction. Not only that, the Japan-U.S. military alliance has exacerbated the tension in the Far East and brought serious threats to the people of China, the Soviet Union and various Asian countries. The Japanese people are extremely indignant at the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet's actions that violate the interests of the Japanese people and the people of all countries. The struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" has rapidly increased from the second half of last year to this year. This movement has developed into a comprehensive and large-scale national movement that includes more than a dozen unified actions centered on the National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," as well as individual activities involving various groups and individuals. Students from the All-Japan Federation of Student Associations (Zengakuren) used force at Haneda Airport to prevent Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke and other "delegations with full powers" from visiting the United States; workers from the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) and other trade unions took strike action at various production posts to express their protests; women held "mothers and daughters expressing grief and indignation rallies"; cultural figures wore black mourning armbands and held silent demonstrations; religious figures held up placards and sang hymns on the streets. Although the movement has various forms, all these actions are filled with the Japanese people's strong protest against the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet's behavior. All the forces accumulated by the Japanese peace movement for more than a decade have now been concentrated in the struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs also has an important task in the struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." As marked by the collection of 35 million signatures to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs and the peace march ending in Hiroshima with the participation of 10 million Japanese people, the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs is the broadest movement in the Japanese peace movement. Many people in the conservative camp also participated in this movement. The central and local organizations of this movement have decided to fully participate in the struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." According to this decision, the issue of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" was raised at the Fifth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held in Hiroshima last August. The Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party immediately exerted strong political pressure on the conference, and right-wing groups also rushed to Hiroshima to use violence against the conference cadres and representatives. However, the masses of people who have actively participated in the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs for many years used their wisdom and courage to repel this oppression and violence, not only ensuring the victory of the "conference in the storm," but also further strengthening the movement due to this test.

Through the discussions at the conference, the representatives deeply realized the serious nature of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" issue. They brought the achievements of the conference back to all parts of the country and clarified the necessity of preventing the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" to the broad masses of the people through report meetings held in various towns and villages. Thanks to this down-to-earth persuasive work, people who did not understand the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in the past began to care about this issue. This has become a huge driving force for the struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in the future.

Although the people of all strata in Japan have expressed their will to protest, the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, which controls the majority of seats in the Diet, has signed a new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and is attempting to further approve this treaty. Although the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet forcibly concluded the new treaty in disregard of the people's protest, the Japanese people's struggle to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" has not lost its significance because of this. It will ignite a greater fire for the struggle to crush the Japan-U.S. "security guarantee system."

	The Japanese people are filled with feelings of apology to the Chinese people and are determined to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism.

Dear friends,

I would like to explain here that this struggle of the Japanese people against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is filled with the Japanese people's feelings of apology to the Chinese people.

In the past, Japan invaded China and brought immeasurable suffering to the Chinese people. The Japanese people are seriously reflecting on this matter. More than a decade after the end of the war, the pain in our hearts has not yet disappeared. Although it is said that it was the behavior of Japanese militarism, we should atone for it from our position.

What should we do to atone for it from our position? It is not enough to just say words of apology. We must take action to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism, crush the Japan-U.S. military alliance, liberate the Japanese mainland and Okinawa from the rule of the U.S. nuclear strategy system, and establish friendly relations between a peaceful and neutral Japan and China. Only in this way can we truly atone for our sins.

The Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet said that it wants to seek to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations on the basis of consolidating the "security guarantee system," which is obviously contradictory. At a time when the current international situation is greatly trending toward peaceful coexistence and complete disarmament, to go against this trend, on the one hand, re-signing a military alliance hostile to China and other countries, and openly claiming that China's territory—Kinmen and Matsu—are included in the scope of military operations, and on the other hand, saying that it wants to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations, this approach is an insult to China. If we want to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations, we must first clearly cancel the attitude of a military alliance hostile to China. Therefore, crushing the Japan-U.S. security guarantee system and breaking the deadlock in Japan-China relations are two aspects of one problem.

	Take concrete actions to realize the basic line of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs

The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs has decided to emphasize complete disarmament and peaceful coexistence, which are global issues, and the issues of opposing militarism, crushing the security guarantee system, and opening Japan-China relations, which are extremely important to Japan, in the basic line of the 1960 movement. We will take the following concrete actions along this basic line.

First, on March 1st, the sixth anniversary of the U.S. Bikini hydrogen bomb disaster, a national conference will be held in Tokyo to promote complete disarmament, realize the cessation of nuclear testing, and prevent the approval of the new Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. Centered on this national conference, the struggle against the security treaty will increase even more. We hope that the Chinese people will support this national conference and give encouraging congratulatory messages.

Second, we will resolutely hold the largest-scale national peace march in history from April to August. It is planned that 20 million people will participate in this peace march, which will connect the northernmost Hokkaido, the southernmost Okinawa Island, and the capital Tokyo. This march will pass through all 46 prefectural governments and all major U.S. military bases and all Japanese Self-Defense Forces bases in Japan. Through this march, the Japanese people's struggle against militarism and against the security guarantee system will be implemented in every corner of the country.

Third, in early August, the 15th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, we will hold the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. The official name of this conference is "The Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs for Comprehensive Disarmament." In the current international and domestic situation in Japan, this world conference has extremely important significance. We sincerely hope that the people of all countries in the world will give support and cooperation, especially the warm support and cooperation of the Chinese people. This year we must create conditions so that Chinese representatives, who have not attended for two years, can participate in the world conference, so that we can take joint action with Chinese representatives as comrades for peace.

Dear friends!

Do you remember Ms. Nogami Yaeko, a sensible Japanese female writer who once visited China? Ms. Nogami was very worried about the fact that Japan was going to establish a Japan-U.S. military alliance hostile to China. She said: "The ethical starting point of the Japanese people should not only be to deny this military alliance in words and writing, but should be shown in practice." Ms. Nogami's sentence is in line with the fundamental spirit of my speech today. We will establish the ethics of the Japanese people through the practice of the struggle against militarism and the security guarantee system, and at the same time fulfill our responsibility to the Chinese people.

Perhaps the war forces inside and outside Japan will hinder the Japanese people's struggle in various ways, but we believe in the wisdom and courage of the Japanese people, and we also believe in the great power of world peace. In particular, we absolutely believe in the Chinese people's enthusiasm and strength for peace. We are confident that united with all peace comrades in the world, the Japanese people's struggle can overcome all obstacles and achieve brilliant victory.

    人民的智慧勇气必能击退一切压迫与暴力
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁在欢迎会上的讲话亲爱的朋友们：
    这次，我承蒙中国人民保卫世界和平委员会亲切的邀请，能再次访问解放后的中国，感到非常高兴。大家对我热情的欢迎，并且举行这样盛大的集会，我衷心表示感谢。
    从去年2月我第一次访问中国到现在，虽然时间只过了一年，但是，在这一年中，中国伟大的建设进一步取得了惊人的跃进。被解放了的六亿五千万人民的生产力和劳动力，战胜了各种困难和阻碍，以比最新式喷气飞机还快的速度，进行着中国的建设。我对中国的大跃进，表示深深的敬意。
    2月13日的晚上，我光荣地出席了在人民大会堂举行的庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订十周年招待会。象征着中国伟大建设的这一雄伟而美丽的人民大会堂，是人民建筑起来的，并为人民所使用，为世界和平和各国人民之间的友好而起作用。对此，我向中国人民衷心地祝贺。
    我衷心地期望，踏进解放后第十一个年头的中国，更加巩固六亿五千万人民的团结，运用丰富的经验和精辟的理论，进一步开辟光辉的未来的道路，成为世界和平的中心力量。
        中国人民热烈支持日本的禁止原子弹氢弹运动，日本人民对此深表感谢
    亲爱的朋友们！
    中国人民采取各种方式，给予日本的禁止原子弹氢弹运动以热烈的支持和协助。我以从事禁止原子弹氢弹运动的日本人民的名义，向中国人民深深表示感谢。
    中国人民还向日本的原子弹氢弹被害者伸出了温暖的慰问之手，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国亚非团结委员会、中华全国总工会、中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会、中华全国青年联合会、中国红十字会总会、中国人民救济总会等七团体，以中国人民的名义，从1955年开始，每年都以巨额的救济金捐赠给原子弹氢弹被害者。
    由于中国人民的温暖的慰问，日本的原子弹氢弹被害者首先在精神上得到了鼓励。这些珍贵的救济金是用在原子弹氢弹被害者的医疗和生活补助，建设广岛、长崎和东京的原子弹氢弹被害者的福利设施，援助原子弹氢弹被害者团体的组织和它们的活动以及其他各种有意义的用途。对此，我代表日本的原子弹氢弹被害者，向中国人民表示深切的感谢。
    即使在岸信介内阁对中国采取敌视政策以后，中国人民仍继续不变地支持和援助日本的禁止原子弹氢弹运动，并对日本的原子弹氢弹被害者给予亲切的慰问。我对中国人民这种充满诚意和友谊的态度，表示衷心的敬意和谢意。
        国际形势的变化证实了毛泽东主席“东风压倒西风”这一名言的正确性
    亲爱的朋友们！
    当我第一次访问中国时，在北京举行的集会上，我曾作了题为“日本的禁止原子弹氢弹运动是打开中日关系的基础”的讲话，在这个讲话里，向各位报告了日本禁止原子弹氢弹运动的历史。所以今天就不再重复这些，而想向各位作关于目前日本和平运动情况和今后动向的报告，但在报告之前，不得不谈一下最近的国际形势及日本国内形势的变化。
    如果用一句话总括起来，国际形势的变化是证实了中国共产党毛泽东主席的“东风压倒西风”这一名言的正确性。各种的和平力量互相合作，给予帝国主义者的战争政策以沉重的打击。这样，国际形势从根本上开始有了转变，由冷战走向和平共处，由扩军竞赛走向彻底废除军备。
    刚才我用了“各种的和平力量”这个词句，其中，政府和人民结为一体，为和平而努力的社会主义各国，是最强大的和平力量。苏联是站在这一和平力量的前列，并由于近年来中国的大跃进，使这一和平力量进一步地加强了。必须早日承认中国在国际上以及在联合国中的正当地位。如果不这样，就不可能实现和平共处和彻底废除军备，这个事实是连帝国主义者也不能无视的。
    反对帝国主义和殖民主义的亚洲、非洲以及拉丁美洲的民族运动，也作为和平力量有着极其重要的意义。蹂躏世界舆论，在撒哈拉进行的法国的原子弹试验，将使亚洲、非洲，特别是非洲的和平运动更加高涨。今年4月，第二届亚非人民会议将在非洲的科纳克里举行。我们必须看到这个会议的重大意义，并为它的成功而尽一切努力。
    资本主义各国人民的和平运动，也已成为和平力量的重要的一部分。最近，美国和英国的和平运动也正在高涨，对此，我表示衷心的欢迎。
    一部分帝国主义者被这些各种和平力量所压倒，不能采取露骨的战争政策，不得不在表面上采取和平政策。但是它们并不是真心地放弃了战争政策。依靠继续冷战和扩充军备来攫取利益的集团，怎么会轻易地放弃战争政策呢？和平力量和战争势力的矛盾依然存在着。
        和平力量必须警惕战争势力假和平的阴谋，以免被“豺狼念经”所欺骗
    当战争势力在表面上采取和平政策的时候，和平力量必须予以严重的警惕。前几天我从刘宁一先生那里知道中国有一句谚语，那就是“豺狼念经”。我认为这的确是一句很好的谚语，因为我也常常听到“豺狼念经”。马克思曾提出过警告说“宗教是鸦片”；但“豺狼念经”更加危险。我感谢中国人民以很好的谚语来忠告我们，我们要充分地加以注意，以免被“豺狼念经”所欺骗。
    亲爱的朋友们：
    正如上面所说，现在的国际形势，是和平力量压倒了战争势力。但是这种和平力量与战争势力的总的关系是否可以立即适用于所有国家的国内形势呢？很遗憾，这是不能的。在某些国家，战争势力至今仍然占着优势，对和平力量施加残暴的镇压。西德就是一个实例。全世界的和平力量应给予在这种镇压下进行英勇斗争的和平事业的同志以有力的支持和热情的援助。
    日本和西德一样，在目前国际形势下，在政治和军事上都占有极其重要的地位。在日本，战争势力和和平力量之间，正进行着激烈的斗争。修改日美安全条约问题就是这一斗争的中心问题。
    岸信介内阁和美国政府勾结，签订新的日美“安全条约”，公然结成了日美两国的军事同盟。这个军事同盟的结成，首先是为了适应美国在战略上的要求。美国多年来想建立东北亚军事同盟的计划，由于美蒋、美李军事同盟和这个新的日美军事同盟结合起来，就此完成了。由于建立日美军事同盟，日本将被纳入美国核战略体系，成为针对中苏两国以及亚洲各国的美国军事基地。
    同时，这一新的日美军事同盟是符合企图以发展军事工业和对外扩张来寻找出路的日本垄断资本集团的利益。岸信介内阁代表这一垄断资本集团的利益。签订了新的日美“安全条约”，复活日本军国主义，使日本必然走上核武装和向海外派兵的道路。
        不准岸信介内阁加剧紧张局势，日本人民决心粉碎日美“安全保障体系”
    岸信介内阁的这一政策，与和平共处、彻底废除军备的国际形势的趋势背道而驰，同时违反了规定放弃战争的日本和平宪法。新的日美“安全条约”根本不是这个条约名称上所说的“保障安全”，而相反的将使日本人民陷入毁灭的危险。不仅如此，日美军事同盟加剧了远东的紧张、给中苏两国以及亚洲各国人民带来严重的威胁。日本人民对于岸信介内阁这种违反日本人民和各国人民利益的行为，感到无比愤慨。反对日美“安全条约”的斗争，从去年下半年到今年，迅速高涨起来。这个运动已经发展成为以阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议为中心展开的十数次统一行动以及包括各种团体和个人的个别活动在内的综合性的大规模的国民运动。全学联的学生在羽田机场以实力阻止岸信介首相等
  “全权代表团”访美；总评及其他工会的工人们在各个生产岗位上采取罢工等行动表示抗议；妇女们举行了“母女表示悲愤大会”；文化界人士佩带黑色丧章举行肃静的示威游行；宗教界人士高举着标语牌，唱着赞美歌到街头举行游行等。运动虽有各种各样的形式，但是在所有这一切行动里都充满着日本人民对岸信介内阁这一行为的强烈抗议。日本和平运动十几年来积聚的一切力量目前都集中到反对日美“安全条约”的斗争中来了。
    禁止原子弹氢弹运动也在反对日美“安全条约”斗争中肩负着重要的任务。正如征集三千五百万人禁止原子弹氢弹的签名和一千万日本人民参加的以广岛为终点的和平大游行所标志的那样，禁止原子弹氢弹运动在日本的和平运动里是最广泛的运动。保守阵营的许多人，也参加了这个运动。这个运动的中央组织和地方组织已经决定将全力参加反对日美“安全条约”的斗争。按照这个决定，去年8月在广岛召开的第五届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会议题中提出日美“安全条约”的问题，岸信介内阁和自由民主党马上对大会加以强烈的政治压迫，右翼团体还赶到广岛对大会干部和代表们施加暴力。但是多年来积极参加禁止原子弹氢弹运动的人民群众用智慧和勇气击退了这种压迫与暴力，不仅保证了“暴风雨中的大会”的胜利，并且由于这种考验而进一步加强了运动。
    代表们通过大会的讨论，深刻的认识了日美“安全条约”问题的严重性质。他们把大会的成就带回全国各地，通过在各町各村举行的报告集会向广大人民群众阐明了阻止修改日美“安全条约”的必要性。由于这种踏实的说服工作，使过去对日美“安全条约”没有理解的人们开始关怀这个问题。这成为以后反对日美“安全条约”斗争的巨大原动力。
    虽然日本各阶层人民表明了抗议的意志，但是控制国会多数议席的岸信介内阁却签订了新的日美“安全条约”，并企图进一步批准这项条约。尽管岸信介内阁不顾人民的抗议强行缔结新条约，但是日本人民阻止修改日美“安全条约”的斗争并不因此而丧失了它的意义。它将为粉碎日美“安全保障体系”的斗争，燃起更大的烈火。
        日本人民充满对中国人民谢罪的心情，坚决阻止日本军国主义的复活
    亲爱的朋友们：
    我想在这里说明，日本人民的这一反对日美“安全条约”的斗争中充满着日本人民对中国人民谢罪的心情。
    在过去，日本侵略了中国，给中国人民带来了不可估量的痛苦，日本人民对这件事情进行着严肃的反省。在战争结束后经过十几年的今天，我们心里的痛苦尚未消逝。虽然说那是日本军国主义的行为，但是我们应该从我们的立场去赎罪。
    要从我们的立场去赎罪，应该怎样做才好呢？只靠嘴巴讲谢罪的话是不行的。我们必须以行动来阻止日本军国主义的复活，粉碎日美军事同盟，从美国核战略体系统治下，把日本本土和冲绳解放出来，在和平中立的日本同中国之间建立友好关系，只有这样才是我们真正能够赎罪的途径。
    岸信介内阁说，他要在巩固“安全保障体系”的基础上谋求打开日中关系僵局，显然这是矛盾的。在目前国际形势大大地趋向和平共处和彻底废除军备的时候，要与这种潮流背道而驰，一方面重新缔结与中国和其他各国为敌的军事同盟，并公然主张中国的领土——金门、马祖包括在军事行动的范围内，同时，另一方面说要打开日中关系僵局，这种做法是对中国的侮辱。如果要打开日中关系僵局，必须首先明确取消与中国为敌的军事同盟的态度。因此，粉碎日美安全保障体系和打开日中关系僵局正是一个问题的两方面。
        采取具体行动，实现日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会的基本路线
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会决定在1960年的运动的基本路线中，重视作为世界性课题的彻底废除军备和和平共处以及对日本来说是极其重要的反对军国主义、粉碎安全保障体系、打开日中关系的问题。我们将沿着这个基本路线，采取下列具体行动。
    第一，在遭受美国比基尼试验氢弹灾害六周年的3月1日，在东京举行促进彻底废除军备、实现停止核试验、阻止批准新日美安全条约的国民大会。以这个国民大会为中心，反对安全条约的斗争将会更加高涨。我们希望中国人民支持这个国民大会，并给予鼓励的贺词。
    第二，我们将从4月到8月间，坚决举行历史上最大规模的国民和平大游行。预定有两千万人民大众参加这个把日本最北的北海道、最南的冲绳岛及首都的东京联接起来的和平大游行。这个游行将路过所有的四十六个都道府县政府所在地，并路过美国在日本的主要军事基地和所有的日本自卫队基地。通过这个游行，日本人民反对军国主义和反对安全保障体系的斗争，将贯彻到全国每个角落。
    第三，在向广岛、长崎投掷原子弹的十五周年的8月上旬，我们要举行第六届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会。这个大会的正式名称定为“为争取全面裁军的第六届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会”。在目前的国际形势和日本国内形势下，这个世界大会有着极其重要的意义。我们衷心希望世界各国人民给予支持和合作，特别是中国人民的热烈的支持和合作。今年我们一定创造条件，使已两年未出席的中国代表能参加世界大会，以便同中国代表一起，作为和平的同志来共同采取行动。
    亲爱的朋友们！
    大家还记得曾经访问过中国的有良识的日本女作家野上弥生子女士吗？野上女士当时对日本将要建立敌视中国的日美军事同盟一事非常担忧，她说：“日本人民的伦理的出发点，不应仅以口头和文字来否定这个军事同盟，而是应该显示于实践”。野上女士的这一句话是和我今天的讲话的根本精神相符的。我们将通过反对军国主义和安全保障体系斗争的实践来确立日本人民的伦理，同时尽到对中国人民的责任。
    也许日本国内外战争势力将对日本人民的这种斗争进行各种阻挠，但是，我们相信日本人民大众的智慧和勇气，同时我们也相信全世界和平的伟大力量。尤其我们绝对相信中国人民对和平的热诚和力量。我们确信，与全世界的和平的同志团结在一起，日本人民的斗争就能排除一切阻碍，取得辉煌的胜利。
