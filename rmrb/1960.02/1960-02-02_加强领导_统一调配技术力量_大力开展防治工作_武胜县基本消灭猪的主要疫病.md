Wusheng County Basically Eliminates Major Swine Diseases
Implementing a combination of professional personnel and mass movements, using folk veterinarians as the backbone, and establishing epidemic prevention institutions and personnel at all levels; discovering folk prescriptions and self-collecting and producing medicinal materials to ensure the supply of medicines.

This newspaper reports that in carrying out swine disease prevention and control work, Wusheng County, Sichuan Province, launched vigorous mass movements, established a county-wide swine epidemic prevention and control network, and basically achieved self-sufficiency in drug supply, effectively ensuring the great development of the pig raising industry. According to statistics at the end of 1959, this county with a population of 470,000 agricultural people had raised more than 486,000 pigs, an increase of more than 130,000 over the end of 1958. Major infectious diseases such as swine fever, swine erysipelas, and swine pneumonia have been basically eliminated or rarely occur, and the morbidity and mortality rates of pigs have rapidly declined. In the past, pig deaths in Wusheng County were quite serious. In some years, the mortality rate of pigs accounted for 8.8% of the total number of pigs, and even reached more than 20%.

After communization, Party committees at all levels, from the county to the commune, strengthened leadership, made full use of the superior conditions of the commune's unified allocation of technical forces and abundant funds, as well as the convenience brought about by the implementation of the policy of collective feeding, and vigorously carried out swine disease prevention and control work: on the one hand, they formed an epidemic prevention team of thousands of people, and on the other hand, they adopted the method of relying on the masses and using local materials to solve the supply of various drugs through self-reliance. As a result, in 1959, the number of pigs that died from disease in the county rapidly decreased to 0.3% of the total, and the incidence of pig diseases also decreased significantly.

Implementing a combination of professional teams and mass movements, with folk veterinarians as the backbone, and setting up epidemic prevention institutions and personnel at all levels is the main experience of Wusheng County in establishing a strong pig epidemic prevention and control team. Now, all 35 communes in the county have epidemic prevention stations. The vast majority of the more than 200 veterinarians and pharmaceutical personnel in these stations have relatively rich work experience. The county has also trained more than 1,100 epidemic prevention workers in batches, spread throughout the management areas of all 35 communes in the county, responsible for pig immunization, feeding inspections, and simple treatment of certain pig diseases. Among the county's more than 14,000 feeders, activities to learn to be all-rounders have also been widely carried out, and many feeders can raise pigs, give injections, treat diseases, and collect medicines. In this way, from top to bottom, there are both professional personnel in charge and the strength of the masses is widely mobilized, forming a strict pig epidemic prevention and control network throughout the county. In order to improve the quality of prevention and control work, Wusheng County also held veterinary refresher courses, organizing veterinarians from various epidemic prevention stations in batches to systematically study courses on swine infectious diseases, common diseases, and traditional Chinese medicine. Then, with these veterinarians as teachers, each commune universally held spare-time animal husbandry and veterinary schools, organizing epidemic prevention workers in various management areas to learn the basic knowledge and methods of preventing and controlling major pig diseases in each season, and helping them continuously improve their working ability. Now, among the more than 1,100 epidemic prevention workers in the county, about one-third have the level of ordinary veterinarians and can treat general pig diseases. For the large number of feeders, the epidemic prevention workers are assigned to be responsible, often going deep into various feeding farms to teach epidemic prevention and hygiene knowledge and simple methods of treating pig diseases.

In solving the drug supply, Wusheng County has adopted a series of methods, such as combining the excavation of local folk prescriptions with the promotion of locally manufactured special prescriptions, and combining the collection of wild medicinal materials with the cultivation of domestic medicinal materials. They often convene forums for old folk veterinarians according to the needs of epidemic prevention work; and widely carry out "collecting folk songs" activities to collect and appraise a large number of rich and effective prescriptions for treating pig diseases among the masses. In the past two years, more than 200 secret and effective prescriptions for preventing and treating pig diseases have been summarized and promoted throughout the county. In opening up sources of medicinal materials, the county has on the one hand widely mobilized the masses to excavate and collect local wild medicinal materials for preventing and treating pig diseases, and on the other hand, the commune has planned to cultivate commonly used domestic medicinal materials. Now, more than 90 kinds of wild medicinal materials that have been found to be effective in treating pig diseases have been excavated throughout the county, and more than 50,000 catties have been collected in 1959 alone. The medicinal materials planted by various health stations also cover more than 60 mu. In order to solve the problem of manufacturing Chinese and Western medicines, in addition to a pharmaceutical factory run by the county, each commune has also run 35 pharmaceutical factories in a simple way. They have been able to manufacture 15 kinds of Western medicines and Chinese medicine powders and mixtures, including chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, tetrahuangsu, yingqiaosan, and wujisan. In 1959, the county manufactured more than 61,000 catties of chlortetracycline and oxytetracycline, more than 2,500 catties of various Chinese medicine powders, and more than 99,000 milliliters of mixtures. In solving the drug manufacturing, the county-run pharmaceutical factory concentrated its manpower to manufacture technically complex drugs such as rabbit-adapted vaccines, and general drugs were self-produced and self-used by the commune. This not only ensured timely supply, but also greatly saved funds. In 1958, many communes spent 700 or 800 yuan, or even more than 1,000 yuan on purchasing pig medicines; in 1959, the general commune's expenditure in this regard was universally reduced to around 100 yuan.

On the basis of properly solving the problems of epidemic prevention forces and drug supply, Wusheng County started from several aspects and resolutely implemented the policy of prevention first and treatment supplemented. On the one hand, according to the epidemic rules and epidemic seasons of pig diseases, preventive injections were repeatedly given with emphasis. In 1959, more than 700,000 pig immunizations against swine fever, swine erysipelas, and swine pneumonia were carried out throughout the county. On the other hand, mass epidemic prevention work was carried out, comprehensive epidemic prevention measures were adopted, and feeding management was generally improved: 1. Wild herbs are often soaked and fed to pigs according to the climate and epidemic season; 2. Pig pens are often disinfected, pig pens are scrubbed with lime water once every half month, and various utensils are cleaned regularly to maintain cleanliness and hygiene. In addition, the county strictly paid attention to pig quarantine work. Thanks to the above measures, in August of the lunar calendar (farmers call it "rotten August"), which has always been the most serious time for swine fever, no pig deaths were found throughout the county in 1959.

    加强领导　统一调配技术力量　大力开展防治工作
    武胜县基本消灭猪的主要疫病
    实行专业人员和群众运动相结合，以民间兽医为骨干，层层设置防疫机构和防疫人员；发掘民间药方，自采自制药材，保证了药物供应。
    本报讯　四川武胜县在开展猪疫病防治工作中，大搞群众运动，建成了遍布全县的猪疫防治网，药物供应基本达到自产自用，有力地保证了养猪事业的大发展。据1959年年底统计，这个拥有四十七万农业人口的县，已养猪四十八万六千多头，比1958年底增加了十三万头以上。猪瘟、猪丹毒、猪肺疫等主要传染病已经基本消灭或者极少发生，猪只发病率和死亡率迅速下降。过去，武胜县猪的死亡现象相当严重，有些年份猪只死亡率曾占猪只总数的8．8％，甚至高达20％以上。
    公社化以后，从县到公社，各级党委加强了领导，充分运用公社统一调配技术力量和资金雄厚的优越条件，以及执行集体饲养为主的方针带来的方便，大力开展猪疫病防治工作：一方面组成了上千人的防疫队伍，一方面采用依靠群众、就地取材的办法，自力更生地解决各种药物的供应。这样，1959年全县病死的猪迅速下降到占总数的0．3％，猪发病率也大大降低。
    实行专业队伍与群众运动相结合，以民间兽医为骨干，层层设置防疫机构和防疫人员，是武胜县建立强大防治猪疫队伍的主要经验。现在，这个县的三十五个公社，社社有了防疫站。这些站里的二百多名兽医、制药等人员，绝大部分具有较丰富的工作经验。县里还分批训练了防疫员一千一百多人，遍布于全县三十五个公社的各个管理区，负责猪只预防注射、饲养检查，以及某些猪病的简易治疗。在全县一万四千多名饲养员中，还普遍开展了学习多面手的活动，许多饲养员作到会养猪，会注射，会治病，会采药。这样，从上到下，既有专业人员负责，又广泛动员了群众力量，在全县范围形成了一个严密的猪疫病防治网。为了提高防治工作质量，武胜县还举办了兽医进修班，分期分批地组织各防疫站兽医人员系统学习猪传染病、普通病和中药学等方面的课程。然后，以这些兽医人员为教师，由各公社普遍举办业余畜牧兽医学校，组织各管理区的防疫员学习各个季节防治主要猪病的基本知识和方法，帮助他们不断提高工作能力。现在，全县一千一百多名防疫员中，有三分之一左右的人已具有普通兽医的水平，能够治疗一般的猪病。对于为数众多的饲养员，则由防疫员分工负责，经常深入各饲养场，传授防疫卫生知识和简单的猪病治疗方法。
    在解决药物供应方面，武胜县采取了发掘当地民间药方和推广当地制造的特效药方相结合，采集野生药材与培育家生药材相结合等一系列的办法。他们经常根据防疫工作需要，召集民间老兽医座谈；并广泛开展“采风”活动，大量搜集鉴定群众中治疗猪病的丰富验方。最近两年来，全县总结推广的防治猪病的秘方、验方就在二百个以上。在开辟药材来源上，这个县一方面广泛发动群众发掘和采集本地防治猪病的野生药材，一方面由公社有计划培育常用的家生药材。现在，全县发掘出的治猪病有效的野生药材达九十多种，仅1959年就采集了五万多斤。各保健站种植的药材也有六十多亩。为了解决中药和西药制造问题，除县开办了一个制药厂外，各个公社还因陋就简地开办了三十五个制药厂。他们已经能制造金霉素、土霉素、四黄素、银翘散、五积散等西药和中药散剂、合剂共十五种。1959年全县共制造金霉素、土霉素六万一千多斤，各种中药散剂二千五百多斤，合剂九万九千多毫升。在解决药物制造中，县办制药厂集中人力制造兔化疫苗等技术较复杂的药品，一般药品由公社自产自用。这样既保证了及时供应，又大大节约了资金。许多公社1958年在购买猪药上支出七八百元，甚至一千多元；1959年一般公社这方面的开支却普遍减少到一百元上下。
    在妥善解决防疫力量和药物供应问题的基础上，武胜县从几个方面着手，坚决贯彻预防为主、治疗为辅的方针。一方面，根据猪病疫流行规律和发病季节，有重点地反复地预防注射。1959年全县普遍进行了猪瘟、猪丹毒、猪肺疫的预防注射七十多万头次。另一方面，开展了群众性的防疫工作，采取了综合性的防疫措施，普遍改善饲养管理：一、根据气候和发病季节，经常泡制野生草药喂猪；二、经常进行圈舍消毒，每半月用石灰水洗刷一次猪圈，经常清洗各种用具，保持清洁卫生。此外，全县还严格注意了猪的检疫工作。由于采取了以上措施，1959年在历来猪瘟最严重的农历八月份（农民称为“烂八月”），全县也没有发现猪只死亡现象。
