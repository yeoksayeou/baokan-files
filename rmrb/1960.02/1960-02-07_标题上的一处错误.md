    An Error in the Title
    The news titled "China's Own Designed Giant Water Conservancy Hub Completed, Liujiaxia Project Cut Off on New Year's Day," published on page three of the People's Daily on January 3rd, reported the completion of the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station cutoff project. Cutoff is only the first step in the construction of a water conservancy hub. Cutting off the river allows it to be temporarily diverted through a designated route to the downstream, in order to free up the construction site for the dam's main body for foundation excavation and concrete pouring. Only when all the buildings of the entire hub are completed can it be said that the water conservancy hub is completed. Therefore, the news title "China's Own Designed Giant Water Conservancy Hub Completed" is not in line with reality.

    标题上的一处错误
    1月3日人民日报三版发表的题为“我国自己设计的巨型水利枢纽建成，刘家峡工程元旦截流”的新闻，是报道刘家峡水电站截流工程完成的。截流仅仅是水利枢纽建设的第一步，把河水截断，使它暂时由指定的路线泄至下游，以便把坝主体部分的施工场地腾出，进行基础开挖和混凝土浇筑。到整个枢纽的所有建筑物全部完成时，才能说水利枢纽建成。因此新闻标题标成“我国自己设计的巨型水利枢纽建成”是不切合实际的。
