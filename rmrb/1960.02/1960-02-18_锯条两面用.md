    Saw Blades Used on Both Sides
    Our steel plant uses a lot of steel saw blades, but each blade can only cut one or two workpieces. We change them several times a day, and the replaced ones are thrown away. If the other side of the saw blade could also be made into teeth, then one blade could be used as two. This would not only save a lot of good steel but also save a lot of funds. Although each one is only worth two dimes, small amounts add up. Based on our factory using twenty pieces a day, it would consume 1,460 yuan a year. If changed to double-sided use, half could be saved. Our factory is a small factory, so it doesn't use much; large factories use more than we do, so savings would be even greater. If we calculate with 10,000 factories like ours across the country (of course, there are more than 10,000), we could save the country more than 7 million yuan every year! What a huge number that is!

    锯条两面用
    我们钢厂用的钢锯条很多，但每条只能锯一两个工作件，一天几换，换下就扔掉了。如果能把锯条的另外一面，也做成锯齿，那么就可以一条顶两条用，不但能省许多好钢，并能节约不少资金。虽然每条只值二角钱，但积少可以成多。按我们厂每天用二十条计算，一年就需要消耗一千四百六十元，若改成两面用就可节约一半。而我们厂是个小厂，用的还不算太多；大厂用的比我们多，节约也就会更多。全国以一万个我们这样的厂子计算（当然不止一万个），每年就可给国家节约七百多万元！这是多么大的数字啊！
