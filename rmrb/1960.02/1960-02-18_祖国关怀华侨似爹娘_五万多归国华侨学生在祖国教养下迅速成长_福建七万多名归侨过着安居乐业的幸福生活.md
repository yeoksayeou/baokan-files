Xinhua News Agency, 17th. This reporter learned from relevant sources: In the past ten years, more than 56,000 overseas Chinese students have returned to the motherland for further education. These overseas Chinese students came from more than 30 countries and regions in Asia, Europe, Africa, the Americas, and Australia, with those returning from Indonesia accounting for more than half. Under the education and cultivation of the motherland, more than 4,000 of them have graduated from universities or secondary vocational schools, mastered various specialized knowledge and skills, and participated in the construction of the motherland.

The People's Government has shown great concern and attention to the study and life of returned overseas Chinese students. In recent years, four large-scale, well-equipped secondary refresher schools for returned overseas Chinese students have been established in Beijing, Guangzhou, Jimei in Fujian, and Shantou in Guangdong. These schools are responsible for receiving newly returned overseas Chinese students and have adopted the teaching principle of "supplementing what is lacking and focusing on key subjects" based on the deficiencies of returned overseas Chinese students in cultural and scientific knowledge, enabling them to catch up with the domestic learning level in a short period of time and successfully enter regular schools. According to statistics, in recent years, 44,800 returned overseas Chinese students have been admitted to secondary or higher schools after studying at these four secondary refresher schools for returned overseas Chinese students. People's grants are given to returned overseas Chinese students who have financial difficulties or whose remittances from overseas have been interrupted, so that they can study with peace of mind.

Under the care and education of the motherland, returned overseas Chinese students have made great progress in all aspects, and a large number of "three good" students with good ideology, good study, and good labor have emerged. Huang Tianshui, a returned overseas Chinese student at Jimei Middle School in Fujian, returned to China in 1957. His food, tuition, and pocket money were all provided by the school. In summer, the school provided mosquito nets, and in winter, cotton-padded clothes and quilts. He was very grateful for the country's care and consideration. He studied very diligently. From the first to the third grade of junior high school, all his grades were excellent. He was named an outstanding "three good" student of the school and was also elected as the vice chairman of the student union. Among the 500 returned overseas Chinese students in Hangzhou, 105 were rated as "three good" students in the first semester of last year, accounting for 21% of the total number of returned overseas Chinese students in the city. More than 100 of them joined the Communist Youth League, and some were even elected as people's representatives of Hangzhou. Last year, Tianjin selected more than 120 returned overseas Chinese students as activists in schools at all levels. They became role models for other students in learning, sports, or labor. According to a survey, the admission rate of returned overseas Chinese students in Guangzhou who applied for universities last year reached 87%, and the admission rate for those who applied for high schools or secondary technical schools reached 86.3%. A large number of national-level athletes and national outstanding athletes have also emerged among returned overseas Chinese students in various places. Huang Qianghui, a returned overseas Chinese student from Indonesia, once broke the world record in the lightweight snatch. More than 200 returned overseas Chinese student athletes represented various provinces and cities in the first National Games in September last year. Among them, top athletes Wang Wenjiao, Chen Fushou, Chen Jiayan, and Huang Bin won five badminton championships; famous swimmers Fu Dajin, Fu Cuimei, and Wang Qiangli ranked among the top in the competition.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 17th. More than 70,000 overseas Chinese have returned to Fujian Province in the past decade and are living a happy and prosperous life under the proper arrangements of the government.

These returned overseas Chinese received a warm reception from the People's Government and local people after returning to China. After returning to their hometowns, the relevant government departments properly arranged for them to participate in production in communes, farms, and factories, or to work in government agencies, schools, and enterprises, according to their own wishes and abilities. The government has also allocated more than 1.7 million yuan to build 18 overseas Chinese farms and factories to resettle those homeless returned overseas Chinese, and distributed more than 2.75 million yuan to help poor returned overseas Chinese find employment and settle down, so that they can all live a comfortable life without worrying about food and clothing. After the establishment of the people's communes, the relevant departments also arranged for those elderly returned overseas Chinese who were helpless to spend their old age happily in nursing homes, according to their wishes.

Under the care, cultivation, and assistance of the Party and the People's Government, the political, cultural, and professional levels of returned overseas Chinese have been continuously improved, and they have made contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland. Many of them have been honorably elected as representatives to people's congresses at all levels, socialist construction activists, and labor models. Guo Mijian, a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia and the director of the Dongbaoshan Overseas Chinese Fruit Farm in Longyan County, has been commended three times by the Fujian Provincial and Longyan County People's Committees for actively developing fruit and livestock production, and was elected as a representative to the county people's congress. Yao Minlun, a returned overseas Chinese worker at the Fujian Machinery Factory, quickly improved his technical level after studying in a technical training class and made contributions to technical innovation. Therefore, he was promoted to serve as the leader of the production team and the shock team, and was also elected as a member of the Fujian Provincial Democratic Youth Federation and a member of the Fujian Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese. He has received six certificates of merit and was awarded the honorary title of a socialist construction activist in Fuzhou. Liao Yafu, a member of the Changshan Overseas Chinese State Farm, did not understand agricultural technology when he first returned to China, but with the help of the farm's Party organization and members, he quickly learned various crop planting techniques, worked very hard, and was repeatedly named a labor model.

With the rapid development of the motherland's socialist construction, the lives of many poor returned overseas Chinese have also been greatly improved. Yan Weiyou, a returned overseas Chinese from the Changshan Overseas Chinese Farm, has eight children. When he was overseas, he and his wife worked all day long, but it was not enough to support the family, and the children could not go to school. Now, both husband and wife work on the farm, and their income has increased year by year. The family lives a good life, and the three oldest children have entered middle school, and the five younger children have also entered elementary school.

    祖国关怀华侨似爹娘
    五万多归国华侨学生在祖国教养下迅速成长
    福建七万多名归侨过着安居乐业的幸福生活
    新华社17日讯　本社记者从有关方面获悉：在过去的十年中，有五万六千多名华侨学生先后回到祖国升学。这些华侨学生来自亚洲、欧洲、非洲、美洲、澳洲三十多个国家和地区，其中从印度尼西亚回国的占一半以上。他们在祖国的教育、培养下，已有四千多人从高等学校或中等专业学校毕业，掌握了各种专门的知识和技能，参加了祖国的建设。
    人民政府对回国华侨学生的学习、生活都非常关怀和重视。几年来，先后在北京、广州、福建集美和广东汕头建立了四所规模宏大、设备齐全的归国华侨学生中等补习学校。这些学校负有接待刚回国华侨学生的任务，还根据归国华侨学生在文化科学知识方面的缺陷，采取了“缺啥补啥，重点补习”的教学原则，使他们在短期内赶上国内学习的水平，顺利地考入正规学校。据统计，几年来经过这四所归国华侨学生中等补习学校补习以后考入中等以上学校的归国华侨学生，有四万四千八百名。各地对经济困难或侨汇中断的归国华侨学生，都分别给予人民助学金，使他们安心就学。
    归国华侨学生在祖国的关怀和教育下，各方面都有了很大进步，涌现了大批思想好、学习好、劳动好的“三好”学生。福建集美中学归国华侨学生黄天水1957年回国后，膳费、学杂费、零用钱等都由学校供给，夏天学校发给蚊帐，冬天发给棉衣棉被，他十分感激国家的关怀和照顾，学习上非常认真，从初中一年级到三年级，每学期的学习成绩全部都是五分，被评为学校的“三好”优秀生，还被选为学生会副主席。杭州市五百名归国华侨学生中，去年上学期有一百零五人被评为“三好”学生，占全市归国华侨学生总数的21％，其中有一百多人参加了共青团，有的还被选为杭州市的人民代表。天津市去年在各级学校中选出一百二十多名归国华侨学生积极分子，他们在学习、体育或劳动等方面成为其他学生学习的榜样。据调查，广州市归国华侨学生去年投考高等学校的录取率达到87％，投考高中或中等技术学校的录取率达86．3％。在各地归国华侨学生中并涌现了大批国家等级运动员和国家优秀运动员。印度尼西亚归国华侨学生黄强辉，曾打破轻量级挺举世界纪录。去年9月代表各省市参加第一届全国运动会的归国华侨学生运动员有二百多名，其中运动健将王文教、陈福寿、陈家琰、黄彬，获得羽毛球五项冠军；著名游泳选手符大进、傅翠美、王强立等都在竞赛中名列前茅。
  　新华社福州17日电　有七万多名华侨在过去十年中回到福建省，在政府的妥善安置下过着安居乐业的幸福生活。
    这些归国华侨回国后，受到人民政府和当地人民的热情接待。他们回到家乡以后，政府的有关部门根据他们自己的志愿和能力，妥善地把他们安置在公社、农场、工厂参加生产，或到机关、学校、企业部门参加工作。政府还先后拨款一百七十多万元，兴建了十八座华侨农场和工厂，安置那些无家可归的归侨，并发放二百七十五万多元，帮助贫苦的归侨就业和安家，使他们都能过着衣食无愁的安乐生活。人民公社建立后，有关部门还根据有些无依无靠的年老归侨的意愿，安排他们在敬老院里欢度晚年。
    归侨在党和人民政府的关怀和培养、帮助下，政治文化和业务水平都不断提高，对祖国的社会主义建设事业作出了贡献，其中有许多人还光荣当选为各级人民代表大会代表、社会主义建设积极分子和劳动模范。印度尼西亚归侨、龙岩县东宝山华侨果牧场场长郭弥坚，由于积极发展果牧生产，先后受到福建省和龙岩县人民委员会三次表扬，并当选为县人民代表大会代表。福建机器厂归侨工人姚敏伦，在技术学习班学习以后，技术水平迅速提高，在技术革新中作出了贡献，因此被提拔担任生产组长、突击队队长，又当选为省民主青年联合会委员、福建省归国华侨联合会委员，先后获得奖状六张，并获得了福州市社会主义建设积极分子的光荣称号。国营常山华侨农场场员廖亚福，刚回国时不懂农业技术，但在农场党组织和场员们的帮助下，很快学会了各种作物的种植技术，干劲很大，多次被评为劳动模范。
    随着祖国社会主义建设事业的飞速发展，许多贫苦归侨的生活也获得了很大改善。常山华侨农场归侨严维有八个孩子，在海外夫妻两人整天劳动，还不够一家人糊口，孩子更无法上学。现在夫妻两人在农场劳动，收入逐年增加，一家人生活过得很好，三个大孩子已升入中学，五个小孩子也进了小学。
