    Launch a Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution Movement Centered on Mechanization and Semi-Mechanization

    Combine Revolutionary Drive with Technical Innovation

    Currently, the main content of the mass movement to increase production and practice economy is to continue to extensively and deeply carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, and vigorously improve labor productivity.

    The history of production development has always been a history of producers constantly using new production technologies to create higher labor productivity, replacing old production technologies, and surpassing old labor productivity. The continuous high-speed growth of labor productivity is an important symbol of the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. Lenin once said: "Communism is a higher labor productivity than capitalism created by voluntary, conscious, and united workers using advanced technology." (Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 29, p. 388). This shows the importance of improving labor productivity.

    From the perspective of the continuous development of the mass movement, the revolutionary drive of the working masses has now been fully mobilized. We must guide it to the direction that has a decisive significance for the development of production, and guide it to the direction of technical innovation and technical revolution. Experience has proven that only by combining the revolutionary drive of the broad masses with technical innovation, and combining the spirit of hard work, the style of doing practical work, and clever methods, can the revolutionary drive of the masses be consolidated and sustained.

    Technical innovation and technical revolution must put politics in command and ideology first.

    First, we must establish the proletarian worldview of continuous revolution and oppose the worldview of cowards and lazy people. The technical revolution is endless. We must not be intimidated by the backward technology of enterprises, nor be intimidated by the advanced technology of enterprises. Small and medium-sized enterprises with backward technology have great potential for technical innovation and can engage in mechanization and semi-mechanization; large enterprises with advanced technology also have many manual operations that need to be replaced by machinery, and can engage in large-scale automation and semi-automation on the basis of mechanization.

    Second, we must adhere to the method of combining leadership, technical cadres, and the masses, launch a large-scale mass movement, and oppose the practice of not believing in the masses, being divorced from the masses, and a few people engaging in technical revolution behind closed doors. The masses are direct producers. Without the production experience of the masses, all technical innovations and technical revolutions will be fruitless. When the No. 1 Machine Tool Factory launched the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the first half of last year, many technicians did not agree with the "three combinations," saying that the "three combinations" had "three impossibilities": design cannot be combined; new products cannot be combined; cutting-edge and complex technologies cannot be combined. However, when the mass movement was launched, the theory of "three impossibilities" immediately went bankrupt. The "three combinations" were not only not "three impossibilities," but greatly improved the quality and quantity of machine tool design and manufacturing.

    Third, we must resolutely support the new things in the process of technical innovation and technical revolution, and oppose the bourgeois master-style attitude of being picky about new things. Technical innovation and technical revolution are new things. The emergence of any new thing must go through a complex and tortuous process of practice-cognition-re-practice-re-cognition, and often requires many failures to succeed. In times of temporary failure, those with conservative ideas often come out to pour cold water. We must resolutely stand on the side of new things, support them, and cultivate and protect their growth like caring for seedlings.

    Fourth, we must adhere to the policy of self-reliance and combining foreign and indigenous methods, and oppose the idea of simply relying on leadership, only reaching out for things, and valuing foreign methods over indigenous ones. The fundamental line of technical revolution is the line of practical work, hard work, clever work, and self-reliance. Use foreign methods if possible, use indigenous methods if foreign methods are not possible, and combine foreign and indigenous methods.

    The experience of many factories and mines proves that starting from foreign methods, starting from indigenous methods, and then improving from indigenous to foreign methods can make the technical innovation and technical revolution movement have the broadest mass character.

    (Excerpted from the "Frontline" editorial, issue 3, 1960: "Raise the Red Flag of Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution")

    Everyone Takes Action, Indigenous Methods Go First, Self-Reliance

    Carrying out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization is one of the important contents of the new stage of socialist construction.

    Concentrating efforts to solve the problem of mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations is the inevitable trend of further development of the current industrial production and technical revolution movement, and it is the most powerful measure to achieve a good start and a red finish for this year's industrial production. In some enterprises, there is often such a situation: the more technical innovation develops in the main workshop, the greater the pressure on manual operation jobs and processes, and sometimes workers have to be added in these areas. This is obviously unfavorable to improving the labor productivity of enterprises and the further development of the technical revolution movement. Especially links such as crushing, loading and unloading, transportation, mining, packaging, cooking utensils, and casting and forging in the machinery industry, it is more urgent to replace manpower with machinery to improve efficiency and liberate labor. At present, for general enterprises, regardless of whether they are new, old, large, or small, the potential in this area is very large.

    Getting rid of heavy manual labor is the urgent desire of the broad masses of workers. They are enthusiastically involved in this movement, and happily sing "We have gained another liberation." Only by implementing mechanization, and then realizing automation, can workers get rid of heavy physical labor, greatly improve labor efficiency, and no longer be in a passive state in the production process, greatly giving play to initiative and creativity. Under such circumstances, labor can become the first need of life. Only in this way can we have time to better engage in political, cultural, and technical studies, and lay the foundation for gradually eliminating the difference between mental and physical labor; and this is an important condition for the transition to communism.

    Like other tasks in economic construction, the realization of mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations must also create a powerful, planned, led, and organized mass movement. Everyone takes action, indigenous methods go first, self-reliance, starting from the existing foundation, and from now on, a vigorous mass upsurge will be launched in the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations. This is a path that is in line with the spirit of the general line of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. This is the fundamental policy for my country's industry to move towards modernization.

    Like the realization of mechanization, the correct policy for the realization of automation should also be to rely on the masses, self-reliance, indigenous methods go first, and gradually moving from indigenous to foreign methods. At present, it is necessary to focus on mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations, but we should not miss any opportunity to promote the development of the mechanical operation automation movement. Similarly, while promoting mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations and automation and semi-automation of mechanical operations, we must not relax the work of spreading and promoting all new technical experiences, as well as the research and experimentation of high-end, sophisticated, advanced, large-scale, and new scientific and technological projects. (Excerpted from the February 12th "China Youth Daily" editorial: "An Important Guarantee for Continued Leap Forward")

    Technical Revolution Must Be Continuous

    Continuously improving the degree of mechanization not only means the growth of social wealth, but also means the reduction of physical consumption and the reduction of labor per unit product. Some worker comrades put it well: "It's terrible not to engage in mechanization, it's amazing to engage in mechanization. Hard work can double or double again, clever work can increase tenfold or a hundredfold." The enthusiasm of worker comrades for innovating equipment is incomparably high. On the one hand, they deeply understand that only by accelerating the improvement of the degree of mechanization can industrial production be developed at high speed and accelerate the construction of socialism; on the other hand, they also fully realize that with the continuous improvement of the degree of mechanization and the continuous improvement of working conditions, workers can use more spare time to study technology, study politics and culture, so that they gradually become laborers with high political awareness, high culture, and high scientific and technical levels, and create conditions for gradually eliminating the difference between mental and physical labor. Therefore, carrying out large-scale mechanization and semi-mechanization movements, and reforming tools and equipment, is a positive factor that leads to greater reforms and leaps in production. Therefore, we must quickly change some heavy physical labor and inefficient manual operations in production into mechanized and semi-mechanized operations, actively transfer the national economy, especially industrial production, to a higher technical foundation, and create higher labor productivity than capitalist society, and create good conditions for us to accelerate the construction of socialism and gradually transition to communism.

    To carry out large-scale mechanization and semi-mechanization, and to carry out continuous revolution in technology, we must first require people to have lofty ambitions and the idea of continuous revolution. Chairman Mao said in "On Practice": "The movement of change in the objective real world is never-ending, and people's understanding of the truth in practice is also never-ending." Continuously improving the degree of mechanization is a kind of revolution to transform nature, and this technical revolution is also constantly moving forward and is endless. The achievements of any modern technology only play the role of eliminating the old and bringing forth the new and carrying on the past in the development of social production. Some comrades cannot see this clearly, and when the existing degree of mechanization in their factory or workshop is relatively high, or when they have achieved some major achievements in technical transformation, they are prone to sitting in a well and looking at the sky, becoming complacent, and producing a kind of "this is the end" thought. This is obviously wrong. We should see that the so-called relatively high degree of mechanization only refers to the comparison at the current stage and within a certain range. If we measure it from a long-term development perspective and within a larger range, it is another situation. Moreover, in many factories with a relatively high degree of mechanization, there are still some jobs or some processes that have a low degree of mechanization and need to be solved quickly.

### 开展以机械化半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动

    开展以机械化半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动
    把革命干劲同技术革新结合起来
    当前，群众性的增产节约运动的主要内容，是继续广泛深入地开展以机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，大力提高劳动生产率。
    历来的生产发展史，都是生产者不断用新的生产技术，创造更高的劳动生产率，代替旧的生产技术，超过旧的劳动生产率的历史。而劳动生产率的不断高速度的增长，则是社会主义制度优胜于资本主义制度的重要标志。列宁曾经说过：“共产主义就是利用先进技术的、自愿自觉的、联合起来的工人所创造出来的较资本主义更高的劳动生产率。”（列宁全集第29卷388页）。由此可见提高劳动生产率的重要性。
    从群众运动的持续发展来看，现在工人群众的革命干劲已经充分地动员起来了，我们必须把它引导到对于发展生产具有决定意义的方向上去，引导到技术革新和技术革命的方向上去。经验证明，只有把广大群众的革命干劲同技术革新结合起来，把苦干的精神、实干的作风和巧干的办法结合起来，群众的革命干劲才能巩固和持久。
    技术革新和技术革命，必须政治挂帅，思想先行。
    第一、要树立不断革命的无产阶级的世界观，反对懦夫和懒汉的世界观。技术革命是无止境的，我们既不要被企业技术落后所吓住，也不要被企业技术先进所吓住。技术落后的中小企业技术革新的潜力大，可以搞机械化、半机械化；技术先进的大企业，也有许多手工操作，需要用机械来代替，并且可以在机械化的基础上大搞自动化、半自动化。
    第二、坚持领导、技术干部和群众三结合的方法，大搞群众运动，反对不相信群众，脱离群众，少数人关门搞技术革命的做法。群众，是直接的生产者，离开群众的生产经验，一切技术革新和技术革命，都将一事无成。第一机床厂去年上半年开展技术革新和技术革命运动的时候，曾经有不少技术人员不赞成“三结合”，说“三结合”有“三不能”：设计不能结合；新产品不能结合；尖端复杂的技术不能结合。但是，当群众运动发动起来以后，“三不能”的理论立刻破产了。“三结合”不但不是“三不能”，相反的大大地提高了机床设计和制造的质量和产量。
    第三、坚决支持技术革新和技术革命过程中的新生事物，反对对待新生事物百般挑剔的资产阶级老爷式的态度。技术革新和技术革命都是新生事物。任何新生事物的产生总要经过实践—认识—再实践—再认识的复杂迂回的过程，往往要经过多次失败，才能成功。在暂时失败的时候，那些有保守思想的人往往会出来泼冷水，我们必须坚决站在新生事物的一边，支持它，像爱护幼苗一样的培植它，保护它成长。
    第四、坚持自力更生，洋土并举的方针，反对单纯依赖领导，只会伸手要东西，重洋轻土的思想。技术革命的根本路线，是实干、苦干、巧干，自力更生的路线，能洋就洋，不能洋就土，洋土并举。
    许多厂矿的经验证明，从洋着眼，从土着手，再由土到洋，不断提高，可以使技术革新和技术革命运动具有最广泛的群众性。
    （摘自1960年第三期“前线”社论：“树起技术革新和技术革命的红旗”）
    人人动手土法上马自力更生
    开展以机械化半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，是社会主义建设新阶段的重要内容之一；
    集中力量解决手工操作机械化、半机械化的问题，是当前工业生产和技术革命运动进一步发展的必然趋势，是实现今年工业生产开门红、红到底最有力的措施。一些企业中，常常有这样一种情况：主要车间技术革新越发展，对手工操作工种和工序的压力就越大，有时竟不得不在这些方面增加工人。这对提高企业劳动生产率和技术革命运动的进一步发展，显然都是不利的。特别像破碎、装卸、运输、采掘、包装、炊具和机械工业中的铸、锻等环节，更迫切需要以机械来代替人力，以提高效率和解放劳力。目前，就一般企业来说，不论新、老、大、小，这个方面的潜力都很大。
    摆脱繁重的手工劳动，是广大工人的迫切愿望。他们满腔热情地投入这一运动，兴高采烈地歌唱“获得了又一次解放”。只有实行机械化，并且进而实现自动化，工人才能够摆脱繁重的体力劳动，劳动效率大大提高，在生产过程中，也就不再是处于被动的状态，大大发挥主动性和创造性，在这种情况下，劳动才有可能成为生活的第一需要。也只有这样，才能有时间更好地从事政治文化技术学习，为逐步消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别打下基础；而这，正是过渡到共产主义的一个重要条件。
    和经济建设中的其他各项工作一样，实现手工操作机械化、半机械化，也必须造成一个强大的有规划、有领导、有组织的群众运动。人人动手，土法上马，自力更生，从现有的基础出发，在手工操作机械化半机械化方面，从现在起就掀起一个轰轰烈烈的群众性热潮。这是一条符合总路线精神的多快好省之道。这是我国工业走向现代化的根本方针。
    同实现机械化一样，实现自动化的正确方针，同样应该是依靠群众，自力更生，土法上马，由土到洋。在目前一个时期，把力量侧重在手工操作机械化、半机械化方面是必要的，但是也应当不放过一切机会，去促进机械操作自动化运动的发展。同样，在推行手工操作机械化半机械化和机械操作自动化半自动化的同时，对于一切新的技术经验的传播和推广工作，以及针对高、精、尖、大、新的科学技术的研究试验，也不能放松。（摘自2月12日“中国青年报”社论：“持续跃进的一个重要保证”）
    技术上也要不断革命
    不断提高机械化程度，不仅意味着社会财富的增长，也意味着体力消耗的减轻和单位产品劳动量的减少。有些工人同志说得好：“不搞机械化不得了，搞了机械化了不得，苦干能翻一倍二倍，巧干能翻十倍百倍。”工人同志对于革新设备的积极性是无比地高涨的。一方面他们深刻地理解到只有加速提高机械化程度，才可以高速度地发展工业生产，加速社会主义的建设；另一方面也由于他们充分地认识到随着机械化程度的不断提高，劳动条件的不断改善，工人就可以利用更多的业余时间研究技术、学习政治和文化，使自己逐步成为具有高度政治觉悟、高度文化和高度科学技术水平的劳动者，为逐步消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别创造条件。所以大搞机械化、半机械化运动，进行工具和设备的改革，这是引起生产的更大改革和飞跃发展的一个积极因素。因此，我们必须尽快地把生产中一些笨重的体力劳动，效率不高的手工操作，改变为机械化和半机械化操作，积极地把国民经济首先是工业生产转移到更高的技术基础方面来，为创造出比资本主义社会更高的劳动生产率，为我们加速建设社会主义和逐步向共产主义过渡创造良好的条件。
    要大搞机械化、半机械化，在技术上进行不断革命，首先就要求人们有雄心壮志和不断革命的思想。毛主席在“实践论”中说：“客观现实世界的变化运动永远没有完结，人们在实践中对于真理的认识也就永远没有完结。”不断提高机械化程度，是改造大自然的革命的一种，这种技术上的革命也是不断前进，永无止境的。任何一项现代技术的成就，在社会生产发展中，只是起到除旧布新，继往开来的作用。有的同志看不清这一点，当本厂、本车间现有机械化程度比较高的时候，或者当技术改造上获得一些重大成就的时候，就容易坐井观天，自满起来，产生一种“到此为止”的思想。这显然是不对的。我们应当看到，所谓机械化程度比较高，那仅是指在目前阶段和在一定的范围内比较而言的，如果从长远的发展观点和在更大的范围内加以衡量，那就是另外一种情况了。而且，在现在许多机械化程度较高的工厂中，也还有一些工种或一些工序机械化程度不高，需要迅速地加以解决。
