Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 26th: Guangdong Province is comprehensively carrying out work to receive and settle returning overseas Chinese.

Reception and resettlement organizations for returning overseas Chinese at the ports of Guangzhou, Zhanjiang, Shantou, Haikou, and other places where returning overseas Chinese enter the country have gathered a large amount of manpower and materials to ensure that reception work is done well. The Guangzhou Sanyuanli Overseas Chinese Guesthouse, having just sent more than 900 overseas Chinese who returned to Guangzhou from Indonesia on the 18th to work and study posts, is immediately busy cleaning the rooms and tidying up the beds, waiting to welcome newly returned overseas Chinese. The Guangzhou Reception Station for Overseas Chinese Students in the suburbs of Guangzhou has also been cleaned spotlessly, with brand new quilts and pillows placed on the beds, and a library reading room has been set up.

State-owned overseas Chinese farms and state-owned farms throughout the province, which are about to settle a large number of returned overseas Chinese, have established reception and resettlement groups, and are stepping up the construction and expansion of houses. Many members of the Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm on Hainan Island have voluntarily vacated their houses to prepare for new members to live in. The workers in the farm's brick and tile factory and wood factory are working day and night to rush to build new houses and make new beds and furniture. The Lufeng Overseas Chinese Farm, Puning Overseas Chinese Farm, and Meixian Overseas Chinese Fruit Farm in the Shantou area are accelerating their expansion work. The Lufeng Overseas Chinese Farm has built more than 100 rooms and plans to continue to build 200 more rooms, and is also stepping up the expansion of schools, kindergartens, nurseries, homes for the elderly, and hospitals for the children of returned overseas Chinese. Zhanjiang Prefecture, one of the key areas in Guangdong Province for receiving and settling overseas Chinese, has decided to convert the state-owned farms of Xinguang, Huasheng, Haixing, and Hongshiyue into state-owned overseas Chinese farms. These farms have made proper arrangements for receiving and settling returned overseas Chinese. In order to welcome new members, overseas Chinese farms in various places are currently rushing to reclaim wasteland and rush to plant vegetables and grain. The Lufeng and Yingde Overseas Chinese Farms have recently reclaimed more than 2,000 mu of wasteland and planted more than 500 mu of vegetables. Many overseas Chinese farms are also vigorously fishing and raising poultry.

In order to arrange for returning overseas Chinese students to attend school, Guangzhou, Hainan Island, Shantou, Zhanjiang, and other places are planning to build and expand a number of overseas Chinese middle and primary schools, overseas Chinese supplementary schools, and overseas Chinese secondary technical schools. The Shantou area has decided to expand the Shantou Overseas Chinese Supplementary School to build a school building that can accommodate 1,500 people, and build a new overseas Chinese primary school in Puning County that can accommodate 1,500 people. At present, the design work for these two projects has been basically completed and preparations are being made to start construction.

At the same time, the transportation departments of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City have sent full-time cadres to do a good job in transportation work after overseas Chinese enter the port. They ensure the timely dispatch of vehicles and ships, so that they arrive and are delivered safely, and ensure that people and luggage arrive at the destination at the same time. Grain, non-staple food, daily necessities and other materials needed by returned overseas Chinese have been properly allocated by the grain and commercial departments in various places. The Guangzhou Municipal Commercial Department has also set up temporary supply points in Huangpu Port, Overseas Chinese Guesthouse and other places.

    新华社广州26日电　广东省各地全面展开接待和安置归国华侨的工作。
    归国华侨入境的广州、湛江、汕头、海口等地港口的接待和安置归侨机构，已集中了大量的人力和物资，以保证做好接待工作。广州市三元里华侨招待所，刚把18日从印度尼西亚回到广州的九百多名侨胞送上了工作和学习岗位，立即又忙碌着打扫房子、整理床铺，等候迎接新归国的侨胞。广州市郊的归国华侨学生广州接待站，也打扫得干干净净，床上放着簇新的棉被和枕头，还布置了一个图书阅览室。
    全省即将大量安置归侨的国营华侨农场和国营农场，都成立了接待和安置归侨小组，并且正在加紧新建和扩建房屋。海南岛兴隆华侨农场的许多场员都自动腾出房子准备给新场员居住。这个农场的砖瓦厂、木工厂的工人们，正为赶建新屋，赶制新床和家具而日夜忙碌。汕头专区的陆丰华侨农场、普宁华侨农场和梅县华侨果林场等，正在加速进行扩建工作。陆丰华侨农场已经建成一百多个房间，还计划继续修建二百个房间，并且加紧扩建归侨子弟学校、幼儿园、托儿所、敬老院和医院。广东省接待和安置华侨重点地区之一的湛江专区，决定将新光、华生、海星、红十月等国营农场改为国营华侨农场。这些农场接待和安置归侨的工作，已作了妥善安排。各地华侨农场，为了迎接新场员，最近正在突击开垦荒地，抢种蔬菜和粮食。陆丰、英德华侨农场最近开垦了二千多亩荒地，种下五百多亩蔬菜。许多华侨农场也正在大力捕鱼，饲养家禽。
    为了安置归国华侨学生就学，广州、海南岛、汕头、湛江等地正在筹划新建和扩建一批华侨中、小学，华侨补习学校和华侨中等技术学校。汕头专区决定在汕头华侨补习学校扩建一座可容一千五百人的校舍，在普宁县新建一座可容一千五百人的华侨小学。现在，这两项工程的设计工作已基本完成，正在准备动工兴建。
    在这同时，广东省、广州市的交通运输部门，派出专职干部，作好华侨进入口岸后的交通运输工作。他们保证及时调度车辆船只，作到随到随送和安全运送，并保证人和行李同时到达目的地。归侨需用的粮食、副食品、生活用品等物资，已由各地的粮食、商业部门调配妥当。广州市商业部门还在黄浦港、华侨招待所等地，设置了临时供应点。（附图片）
