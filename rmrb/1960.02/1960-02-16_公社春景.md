    Spring Scene of the Commune
    Zhang Cheng
    Spring Tide
    The cold wind has ended, and spring has arrived,
    The spring scene of the commune is hard to describe,
    Iron oxen sing loudly, red flags dance,
    Spring tide surges across the mountains and fields.
    Spring Thunder
    A clap of spring thunder shakes the earth,
    Flowers and trees sprout, all kinds of grass grow,
    The spring breeze unfurls a large red flag,
    Mountain songs and water laugh, people rejoice.
    Spring Plowing
    Regardless of whether the golden rooster crows,
    Drive the iron ox to the fields,
    Finish plowing a thousand acres by sunrise,
    The new soil smiles at the sun.
    Spring Sowing
    Red flags flutter and dance in the spring breeze,
    The sowing machine rings out,
    Leap Forward seeds are scattered on the ground,
    Turn around and smile at the green fields.
    Spring Dawn
    Spring dawn, the fields are misty,
    Dewdrop "lamps" hang on the wheat seedlings,
    Where songs rise, silver hoes fall,
    Faces are more beautiful than peach blossoms.
    Spring Rain
    The spring breeze blows, and the spring rain falls,
    The spring rain gently taps the window panes,
    Commune members pick cotton seeds indoors,
    Looking at the rain through the window, they laugh heartily.
    Spring Irrigation
    Orioles sing the arrival of spring from the treetops,
    Watering the wheat thinly and applying fertilizer,
    Today the wheat sea rolls with silver water,
    Tomorrow, golden mountains hold up white clouds.

    公社春景
    张诚
    春潮
    寒风已尽春来到，
    公社春景巧难描，
    铁牛高歌红旗舞，
    满山遍野泛春潮。
    春雷
    春雷一声天地动，
    花木发芽百草生，
    春风抖开大红旗，
    山歌水笑人欢腾。
    春耕
    不管金鸡叫不叫，
    驾起铁牛下地了，
    日出耕完千亩田，
    新土望着太阳笑。
    春播
    红旗漫卷舞春风，
    播种机器响??，
    跃进种子撒下地，
    回头笑看满田青。
    春晓
    春晓田野雾蒙蒙，
    麦苗尖上挂珠灯，
    歌声起处银锄落，
    人面胜似桃花红。
    春雨
    春风吹得春雨下，
    春雨轻轻拍窗花，
    社员屋内拣棉籽，
    隔窗望雨笑哈哈。
    春灌
    枝头黄莺报春音，
    小麦浇稀又追肥，
    今朝麦海滚银水，
    来日金山托白云。
