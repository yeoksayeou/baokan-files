Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, Ningxia
Establishing Seed Breeding Bases at All Levels

    This newspaper reports that Heilongjiang Province has formed a seed breeding network from the county and commune to the management district level. All people's communes and state-owned farms in the province have prepared sufficient quantities of improved seeds for various crops according to the planting plan. At the same time, the province has also transferred a large number of improved seeds to support nineteen provinces (regions) including Ningxia and Jilin.
    The people's communes have opened up broad prospects for improved seed breeding work. People's communes in various localities have made overall plans according to the specific conditions of their regions, and have established breeding farms in management districts suitable for breeding improved seeds; management districts have also established improved seed breeding teams in production teams suitable for breeding improved seeds. Among the more than six hundred people's communes in the province, 449 improved seed breeding farms have been established, and more than 4,700 management districts have established breeding teams. The entire province has formed an improved seed breeding system, creating favorable conditions for guaranteeing the need for improved seeds and continuous replacement, as well as the cultivation of new varieties. In 1959, the province bred 1 billion jin of improved varieties through the communes, and promoted 513 improved varieties, bringing the area sown with improved seeds in the province to more than 85%, of which the area sown with improved seeds for spring wheat, rice, corn, soybeans and other crops accounted for 93%.
    Xinhua News Agency reports that Zhejiang Province has universally established improved seed breeding bases in preparation for spring plowing, creating conditions for further cultivating and popularizing high-yield improved seeds in the future. At present, all counties (cities) in the province, with the exception of two counties, have established directly subordinate improved seed breeding farms, and more than 80% of the communes have also established improved seed breeding farms, and more than 45% of the production teams have seed plots.
    In 1959, Zhejiang Province had basically achieved improved seed for all major crops. In that year, the province had one provincial-level improved seed breeding farm, more than ten county-level improved seed breeding farms, and more than four hundred commune-level improved seed breeding farms. This year, the provincial agricultural departments have established one cotton and one coarse grain improved seed breeding farm each, and various special districts, counties, and communes have also universally established improved seed breeding bases for rice, coarse grains, cotton, and hemp crops according to local needs.
    After the selection of late rice seeds last year in Zhejiang Province, special districts throughout the province successively convened seed pacesetter conferences, erected the banner of breeding improved seeds, and called on the people of the province to learn.
    Xinhua News Agency reports that Ningxia is actively establishing a network of crop improved seed breeding bases, in order to further select and cultivate improved seeds in a planned way.
    Since the Great Leap Forward, people's communes and production brigades in Ningxia have conscientiously implemented the seed work policy of "self-breeding, self-selection, self-retention, self-use, supplemented by adjustment," so that the area sown with improved seeds has rapidly expanded to account for 78.6% of the total crop sown area. However, in the process of popularizing improved seeds, some areas still have a phenomenon of emphasizing promotion and neglecting selection and breeding, and have not established improved seed breeding bases well, resulting in the gradual degeneration of some varieties. This year, party committees at all levels in the autonomous region have further strengthened their leadership over seed work, and have actively improved the organizational structure related to seed work and established improved seed breeding bases from the beginning of spring plowing preparation work. Various state-owned farms and special district and county farms have established 24 national original seed breeding farms, and most people's communes have established commune-run improved seed breeding farms, and more than 2,000 production brigades have also established specialized seed teams. National original seed breeding farms mainly produce original seeds and are responsible for introducing and cultivating new varieties; commune-run improved seed breeding farms, under the guidance of commune-run agricultural science research institutes (stations), are responsible for expanding the breeding of original seeds to meet the needs of production brigades; the seed specialized teams of production brigades mainly breed the improved seeds needed by their own teams in a planned way.
    At present, improved seed breeding farms and specialized seed teams in various localities have generally selected land with good soil quality to prepare for breeding improved seeds. Agricultural scientific research departments in various localities are helping people's communes train seed breeders, custodians, and inspectors, and are widely imparting scientific and technical knowledge.

    黑龙江·浙江·宁夏
    层层建立良种繁殖基地
    本报讯　黑龙江省已形成县、公社到管理区的良种繁育网。全省各人民公社和国营农场，已按播种计划备齐各种作物良种，同时全省还调出大批良种支援了宁夏、吉林等十九个省（区）。
    人民公社给良种繁育工作开辟了广阔的前途。各地人民公社按照本地区的具体情况，作了全面规划，在适合繁殖良种管理区建立了繁殖场；管理区也在适合繁殖良种的生产队设立了良种繁育队。全省六百多个人民公社中，建立良种繁殖场四百四十九处，四千七百多个管理区建立了繁殖队，全省形成了良种繁育体系，为保证良种需要和不断更换，以及新品种的培育创造了良好的条件。1959年全省由公社繁殖的优良品种达十亿斤，推广的优良品种达五百一十三个，使全省的良种播种面积达85％以上，其中春小麦、水稻、玉米、大豆等作物的良种播种面积占93％。
    新华社讯　浙江省各地在备耕中普遍建立了良种繁育基地，为今后进一步培育和普及高产良种，创造条件。目前，全省除两个县以外，其他县（市）都建立了直属良种繁育场，80％以上的公社也分别建立了良种繁殖场，45％以上的生产队有种子田。
    1959年，浙江省各项主要农作物已经基本实现良种化。这一年，全省有省属良种繁育场一个，县良种繁育场十多个，公社的良种繁殖场四百多个。今年，省农业部门又建立了棉花、杂粮良种繁育场各一个，各专区、县、公社也都按照当地需要普遍建立了水稻、杂粮、棉、麻作物的良种繁育基地。
    浙江省去年晚稻选种结束后，全省各专区先后召开了种子标兵会议，树立繁育良种的旗子，号召全省人民学习。
    新华社讯　宁夏各地积极建立农作物良种繁育基地网，进一步有计划地选育和培植良种。
    大跃进以来，宁夏各地人民公社、生产大队都认真贯彻“自繁、自选、自留、自用，辅之以调剂”的种子工作方针，使良种面积很快扩大到占全部作物播种面积的78．6％。但在普及良种工作中，有些地区仍然有重视推广放松选育的现象，没有很好地建立良种繁育基地，以致有些品种逐渐退化。今年自治区各级党委进一步加强了对种子工作的领导，从备耕工作开始就积极健全有关种子工作的组织机构，建立良种繁育基地。各国营农场和专区、县农场已建立国家原种繁殖场二十四个，大部分人民公社都建立了社办良种繁育场，有二千多个生产大队也建立了种子专业队。国家原种繁殖场，主要是生产原种，负责引种和培育新品种；公社的良种繁育场，在社办农业科学研究所（站）的指导下负责扩大繁殖原种，满足生产大队的需要；生产大队的种子专业队，主要有计划地繁育本队需要的良种。
    现在，各地的良种繁殖场和种子专业队，一般都选择了土质好的土地，准备繁育良种。各地农业科学研究部门正帮助人民公社培训种子繁育员、保管员和检查员，广泛传授科学技术。
