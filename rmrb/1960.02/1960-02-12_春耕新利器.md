New Tools for Spring Plowing

    Electric Rice Transplanter
    The Jiaxing Woodworking Agricultural Implement Factory in Zhejiang Province has recently successfully trial-produced and begun production of an electric rice transplanter.
    The No. 6 Production Team of the Nanhu Commune used this machine to transplant rice in a trial, which increased efficiency more than twenty times compared to manual labor. Moreover, the seedlings were planted evenly, with no missing or skipped seedlings.

    New Type Diesel Engine
    The Liuzhou General Machinery Factory has recently successfully trial-produced a 75-horsepower 3160 model diesel engine.
    This diesel engine has the advantages of compact structure, simple operation, stable operation, and low fuel consumption. It can be used for pumping water, generating electricity, and driving machines, and is particularly suitable for agricultural irrigation and drainage.

    Horse-Drawn Double-Share Ridging Plow
    The Tie-Mu Factory of the Daliu Town People's Commune in Renqiu County, Tianjin, has successfully modified a horse-drawn double-share ridging plow.
    This plow is suitable for converting land to paddy fields and promoting terraced fields on a large scale. Drawn by two horses, it can ridge as much soil in a day as forty-five people can manually. This ridging plow has a simple structure, made by connecting two double-blade plows with five iron rods, and then adding a plow pan. Each unit costs only twenty-five yuan.

    春耕新利器
    电动插秧机
    浙江省嘉兴木器农具厂最近试制成功电动插秧机，并开始生产。
    南湖公社六号生产队曾试用这种机器插秧，比人工提高效率二十多倍，而且英苗插得匀，无缺株漏秧。
    新型柴油机
    柳州通用机械厂最近试制成功一台七十五马力三一六○型柴油机。
    这台柴油机具有结构紧凑，操作简单，运转平稳，耗油少等优点。它既能抽水，发电，又可带动机器，特别对农业排灌很适用。
    马拉双铧培埂犁
    天津市任丘县大留镇人民公社铁木厂改制成功马拉双铧培埂犁。
    这种犁适用于改种稻田和大搞畦田化。用两匹马拉，一天培的土埂，顶人工四十五个。这种培埂犁构造简单，用五根铁棍连接两架双锋犁，再配制犁盆就成。每架成本只有二十五元。
