    Thirty Korean Apples
    Song Zhuoping
    When we visited various places in heroic Korea, the hospitable hosts always diligently placed all kinds of apples in front of us. The apples were ruby-like, golden-like, emerald-like… The hosts said with a smile: "Eat more of our apples! We have a legend here that when people far away smell the fragrance of apples, they will return to their hometowns." The hosts often split the apples in half, enthusiastically inviting the guests to eat one half and eating the other half themselves. We felt particularly close to this brotherly friendship. Because, according to Chinese customs, only with the closest people do we share apples in this way.
    I came from the heroic Fujian front to visit the heroic Korea. Every time I saw the magnificence of Korean apples and smelled the fragrance of Korean apples, I couldn't help but think that these Korean apples symbolized the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people cemented with blood. During the days when Chinese artillery shook Jinmen, they came to the front line in Fujian, China, the forefront of war and smoke, carrying Premier Kim Il-sung's concern and the deep affection of Korean comrades.
    Now, let me retell the heart-stirring story of the thirty Korean apples traveling on the Fujian front!
    In November 1958, when Premier Kim Il-sung visited China, he gave a batch of the best apples to Chairman Mao Zedong. Chairman Mao distributed them to various central departments. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications also received a portion, a total of thirty apples. The leaders of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications gave this precious gift to the cadres who were participating in labor training at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in Beijing as encouragement. When the comrades received these apples, they were very moved. They thought, "How can we accept such a precious gift? We should give it to the steelworkers who are fighting to complete 10.7 million tons of steel."
    The steelworkers of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, who had worked hard for 10.7 million tons of steel, received the apples but still felt that they should not accept them. So who should they give them to? They thought of the war-torn Fujian front and the officers and soldiers of the three services who were bravely fighting to defend the motherland and defend peace. "Yes! The apples should be sent to the front line of battle!" So, the thirty apples, packed in a red wooden box, traveled thousands of miles from Beijing to the Fujian front. The Fujian front received too many apples, some sent from Northeast China, some from Northwest China. But these were not thirty ordinary apples; they were apples symbolizing the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. Who should they be given to? After careful consideration, the leading organs of the front-line troops decided to distribute the thirty apples to the air force, navy, artillery, infantry, border defense troops who had made meritorious contributions in punishing the Chiang army, and to the heroes who were bravely wounded in battle. Thus, the precious Korean apples began their extraordinary journey on the Fujian front.
    On New Year's Eve in 1958, five apples were sent to the leading organs of the front-line air force units. The Air Force Party Committee considered it for a long time and finally decided that only the people of Fujian who supported the front line should receive the apples. On the afternoon of New Year's Eve, representatives of the air force units walked into the Fuzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China with five apples in their hands. The first secretary of the municipal party committee took the apples, how excited he was! He immediately called the steel plant, the machine factory, and the people's commune to let the workers and farmers discuss who these apples should be given to. The workers and farmers told the municipal party secretary their common decision: "Send them back to the air force soldiers who are defending the motherland's airspace!" So, the five apples returned to a certain air force base on the front line. When these apples were sent to the airport, news spread quickly under the wings of the planes and on the runways. Everyone passed on the good news, but in the end, no one tasted them. The air force soldiers gave them to one of the earliest people's communes established in Fujian Province—the Chengmen People's Commune in Minhou County. The commune members received these treasured apples and celebrated by sending them to the exhibition hall of the people's commune as a major happy event after the establishment of the people's commune and as their greatest honor.
    The leading organs of the front-line navy also received five apples and immediately distributed them to various heroic boats and coastal artillery units. One apple was sent to a certain gunboat detachment, and the head of the detachment personally arranged: "This apple must be seen by every comrade, and finally sent to the Second Squadron, which has made a collective second-class merit." The comrade who accepted this task pasted red paper on the wooden box containing the apple, edged it with gold, and wrote "Precious Friendship" and "Extraordinary Apple" on it. He also lined the box with gold paper, placed the apple on it, and set off holding it with both hands. He first sent the apple to the Third Squadron. The sailors of the Third Squadron had already stood in neat formation, waiting by the dock. Everyone took turns looking at it and smelling it. The apple was finally sent to the gunboat of the Second Squadron. On the deck, the sailors took turns holding the apple, smelling it, and passing it to the next person. After one boat was finished, it was passed to the second boat. However, the Second Squadron did not keep the apple either. They sent a representative to return the apple to the political commissar of the detachment and requested the political commissar: "We cannot accept this lofty honor. The apple should carry the sailors' respect and be transferred to other heroic units." There were too many heroic units on the Fujian front, but there was only one apple. After repeated consideration, the political commissar sent the apple to the artillery at the very front line.
    Another naval detachment also received a Korean apple. The head of the detachment personally introduced the origin of this Korean apple to the comrades. Everyone heard that this was an apple given by Premier Kim Il-sung to Chairman Mao, and that it had come to their detachment today. They all cheered and picked up the apple. A soldier named Lin Youren picked up the apple and couldn't help but feel excited: "This is a gift from the beloved leaders of the Chinese and Korean people. It is the greatest happiness that I can hold it in my own hands." Although everyone was reluctant to part with the apple, they still decided to give this precious apple to another unit. Which unit should they give it to? It became a difficult problem again. Coincidentally, the Hunan Provincial Folk Song and Dance Troupe was giving a consolation performance on the front line. A soldier came up with a good idea: entrust the comrades of the song and dance troupe to bring the apple to the villagers of Shaoshan Village, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province—the hometown of Chairman Mao.
    The front-line artillery units also had five precious apples, one of which was sent to the Hu Dean Heroic Squad, which had made a collective second-class merit in the shelling of Jinmen. When the squad leader brought the apple back to the squad, the soldiers were all excited and expressed their determination:
  "We will definitely use our cannons to punish the enemy more fiercely and accurately!" Everyone also said: "Send this apple to Comrade Hu Dean so that he knows that Premier Kim Il-sung and Chairman Mao are concerned about him." Hu Dean, in the artillery battle on September 11, 1958, with a lofty spirit of collectivism, fired a shell that was about to explode from the hot gun barrel. He also picked up another shell that had been in the flames for a long time and might explode in a few seconds, loaded it into the gun barrel, and fired it at the enemy's position, protecting the safety of the cannon and his comrades. He himself was burned into a "fire man," with burn area covering 66% of his body. Under the care of the Party and with the help of medical personnel, he overcame death and was recovering his health in the hospital. Only a warrior like Hu Dean, a true gold refined by fire, should accept such a precious apple. Entrusted by all the soldiers in the squad, the squad leader went to the rear hospital and handed the apple to Hu Dean. Hu Dean kissed the apple, and his whole body seemed to be filled with strength. Then he handed the apple back to the squad leader and said: "Thank you, Chairman Mao, thank you, Premier Kim Il-sung. The Party saved me from death, and I have already received too much." He asked the squad leader to take the apple back and give it to the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese Fujian Front Comfort Group that came to the front line to offer condolences. The squad leader had no choice but to take the apple back and wrapped it in red paper before forwarding it to the comfort group. Later, the comfort group went to a certain air force base to offer condolences and gave it to the air force.
    The infantry units received the most apples, a total of ten. Among them, two apples crossed the ocean and were sent to two small islands relatively close to the Greater and Lesser Jinmen Islands occupied by the Chiang army. When the apples arrived on the island, the soldiers solemnly held a reception ceremony, cheering the names of the great leaders of the Chinese and Korean people, "Mao Zedong, Kim Il-sung," and submitted a letter of determination to the Party: "We must resolutely, bravely, and cleanly eliminate any enemy who dares to invade!" Finally, the soldiers surrounded the apples and cut them into countless small pieces. Although everyone only tasted a little bit, how excited and sweet the soldiers felt in their hearts!
    The five apples sent to the border defense troops had the longest journey. The apples traveled more than a thousand miles along the Fujian coastline from the northeast to the south, from one company to another. Almost every border defense soldier met, touched, and kissed the apple.
    However, it still happened that a certain squad stationed on the front line of the coast defense was unable to see these Korean apples. One day, when the soldiers saw the news in the newspaper that "Thirty Extraordinary Korean Apples Have Arrived on the Fujian Front," they immediately surrounded the squad leader, Fang Fusheng, and asked the squad leader to read it to everyone. Fang Fusheng read the news once, and some soldiers requested: "This is great, squad leader, please read it again!" When Fang Fusheng finished reading it for the third time, a young soldier named Xin Tai suddenly said: "Squad leader, I seem to see the apple and smell its fragrance." "Squad leader, I also smell the fragrance." Fang Fusheng excitedly put down the newspaper, looked at everyone, and said softly: "You smelled it, I smelled the fragrance too." They all smiled happily. They smelled the rich fragrance of the blooming flowers of Sino-Korean friendship.
    These thirty apples each had their own extraordinary experience and heart-stirring story on the Fujian front. When we visited heroic Korea for a month and saw the brilliant achievements made by the People's Republic, which had boarded the Chollima horse, under the leadership of the Workers' Party and Premier Kim Il-sung, saw the fearless spirit of the Korean people overcoming all difficulties and being unyielding on the road of construction, saw the ever-increasing friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, and saw the Korean people's heartfelt love for their leader, Premier Kim Il-sung, it made me more deeply understand why thirty Korean apples on the Chinese Fujian front excited us so much and produced such great power.

    三十只朝鲜苹果
    宋祝平
    当我们在英雄的朝鲜各地访问的时候，好客的主人，总是殷勤地在我们的面前，摆满了各色各样的苹果。苹果有红玉般的，有黄金般的，有绿宝石般的，……主人笑着说：“多吃一点我们的苹果吧！我们这里有这样的传说，当远出的人，闻到了苹果的香味，就要回到故乡来了。”主人们还常常把苹果一劈两半，热情地请客人吃一半，自己吃一半。这种兄弟般的情谊，我们感到特别亲切。因为，按照中国的习惯，只有和最亲密的人，才是这样分吃苹果的。
    我从英雄的福建前线来访问了英雄的朝鲜，每一次看到朝鲜苹果的瑰丽，闻到朝鲜苹果的清香，就不能不想到，就是这样的朝鲜苹果，象征着朝中两国人民用鲜血凝成的友谊。在中国万炮震金门的日子里，它们曾经带着金日成首相的关怀，带着朝鲜战友的深情厚意，来到了中国福建前线，到了战火纷飞、硝烟弥漫的最前方。
    现在，就让我向同志们重述一次关于三十只朝鲜苹果在福建前线旅行的动人心弦的故事吧！
    1958年11月，金日成首相访问中国的时候，曾把一批最好的苹果，送给了毛泽东主席。毛主席把它分赠给中央各个部门。中央邮电部也收到了一份，一共三十个苹果。邮电部的领导同志把这一份珍贵的礼物又送给了正在北京石景山钢铁厂参加劳动锻炼的干部，作为对他们的鼓励。当同志们收到这份苹果时，十分感动，他们想：“我们怎么能接受这样珍贵的礼物？应该把它送给为完成1070万吨钢而战的钢铁战士。”
    为1070万吨钢付出艰辛劳动的石景山钢铁工人收到了苹果，仍然认为自己不应该接受。那么把它送给谁？他们想到了战火纷飞的福建前线，想到了为保卫祖国、保卫和平英勇战斗的三军将士。“对！应该把苹果送到战斗的第一线去！”于是，这三十只苹果，装在一个红色的木箱里，经过了几千里的长途旅行，从北京来到了福建前线。福建前线收到的苹果太多了，有从祖国的东北寄来的，有从祖国的西北寄来的。可是，这不是三十只普通的苹果，是象征着朝中人民牢不可破的友谊的苹果。应该把它送给谁？前线部队领导机关经过慎重考虑，决定把三十只苹果，分送给惩罚蒋军有功的空军、海军、炮兵、步兵、边防部队和战斗中英勇负伤的英雄们。于是，这珍贵的朝鲜苹果，就开始了在福建前线不平凡的旅程。
    1958年除夕，五只苹果送到了前线空军部队领导机关。空军党委考虑了很久，最后决定，只有支援前线的福建人民应该得到苹果。就在除夕这天下午，空军部队的代表双手捧着五个苹果走进了中共福州市委员会。市委第一书记接过这些苹果，他是怎样激动呵！马上打电话通知炼钢厂、机器厂和人民公社，让工人、农民讨论，这些苹果送给谁？工人、农民把自己共同的决定告诉市委书记：“再送给保卫祖国领空的空军战士！”于是，这五只苹果又重新回到前线某空军基地。送给1958年10月在龙田上空一举击落蒋机两架的某飞行部队。当这些苹果送进机场的时候，机翼下、跑道上，人人争传喜讯，但是，最后没有一个人尝它。空军战士们又把它送给了福建省最早建立的人民公社之一——闽侯县城门人民公社。社员们接到这宝贝一样的苹果，欢呼着把它送到人民公社的展览馆里，作为成立人民公社后的一件大喜事，作为自己最大的荣誉。
    前线海军领导机关，也收到了五只苹果，马上分送到各个英雄艇和海岸炮兵部队去。有一只苹果送到炮艇某大队，大队首长亲自安排：“这只苹果一定要和每个同志见面，最后送给立下集体二等功的二中队”。接受这个任务的同志，把装苹果的木盒糊上红纸，镶上金边，并且写上“珍贵的友谊”，“不平凡的苹果”两行字，又在盒里垫上金纸，把苹果放在上面，双手捧着出发了。他先把苹果送到三中队，三中队的水兵们早就整齐地站好队，等在码头旁边。大家挨个地看，挨个地闻。苹果最后送到二中队的炮艇上。在甲板上，水兵们一个挨一个捧着苹果闻一闻，再传递给下一个人。一艘艇传完了，再传递给第二艘艇。可是，二中队也没有留下这只苹果，他们派了代表，又把这只苹果送回到大队政治委员手中，并且要求政治委员：“我们不能接受这崇高的荣誉，应该让苹果带着水兵的敬意，转送给其他英雄单位。”福建前线的英雄单位太多了，苹果却只有一只，政治委员再三考虑，把苹果送给了最前线的炮兵。
    另一海军分队，也收到了一只朝鲜苹果。分队首长亲自向同志们介绍了这只朝鲜苹果的来历。大家听说这是金日成首相送给毛主席的苹果，今天到了自己的分队，都欢笑着把苹果捧起来。一个叫林友仁的战士捧起苹果，忍不住自己心头的激动：“这是朝中两国人民敬爱的领袖的礼物，我能亲手捧到它，真是最大的幸福。”虽然，大家都舍不得和苹果分开，但是，仍旧决定把这只珍贵的苹果送给别的单位。送给哪一个单位呢？又成了难题。恰好，湖南省民间歌舞团正在前线作慰问演出，有一个战士想出一个好主意：委托歌舞团的同志把苹果带给毛主席的故乡——湖南省湘潭县韶山村的乡亲们。
    前线炮兵部队也有五只珍贵的苹果，其中的一只送给了在炮击金门中，立下集体二等功的胡德安英雄班。当班长把苹果带回班里，战士们人人激动，表示自己的决心：
  “一定更狠、更准地用大炮惩罚敌人！”大家还说：“把这只苹果给胡德安同志送去，让他知道金日成首相、毛主席在关怀着他。”胡德安，在1958年9月11日的炮战中，以崇高的集体主义精神，射出了炽热的炮膛中一颗即要爆炸的炮弹，又抱起另一颗在火焰中放了好久，可能再有几秒钟就会爆炸的炮弹，填进炮膛，射向敌人的阵地，保护了大炮和战友的安全。而他自己，却被烧成了一个“火人”，全身烧伤面积达66％。他又在党的关怀下，在医务人员的帮助下，战胜了死亡，正在医院里恢复着健康。只有胡德安这样烈火真金般的战士，才应该接受这样珍贵的苹果。班长受了全班战士的委托，到了后方医院，把苹果交到胡德安手中。胡德安亲了亲苹果，全身似乎充满了力量。便又把苹果交到班长手中说：“谢谢毛主席，谢谢金日成首相，是党从死亡中救活了我，我已经得到的太多了。”他要求班长把苹果带回去，送给到前线来慰问的中央华侨事务委员会、全国华侨联谊会福建前线慰问团。班长只好带着苹果回来，用红纸包着转送给慰问团。以后，慰问团到空军某基地去慰问，又把它送给了空军。
    步兵部队分到的苹果最多了，一共有十只。其中，有两只苹果，跨过海洋，分别送到了距离蒋军盘踞的大、小金门岛比较近的两个小岛。苹果到了岛上，战士们庄严地举行了受礼仪式，欢呼着朝中两国人民伟大领袖的名字“毛泽东、金日成”，并且，向党递交决心书：“要坚决、勇敢、干净地消灭敢来侵犯的敌人！”最后，战士们围着苹果，把苹果切成了无数小块，每个人虽然只尝到了那么一点点，可是，战士们的心里是多么兴奋，多么甜呵！
    有五只送给边防部队的苹果，它们旅行的道路要算最长了。苹果沿着福建从东北到南海岸线，从一个连队传送到另一个连队。旅行了一千多里，几乎每个边防战士，都和苹果见了面，摸了它，亲了它。
    可是，仍然发生了这样的事，驻守在海防前哨的某一个班，没有能够看到这些朝鲜苹果。有一天，战士们看到报纸上登载着“三十只不平凡的朝鲜苹果到了福建前线”的消息，立刻把班长方福生围住，要求班长念一念大家听。方福生把消息念了一遍，有的战士就要求：“这太好了，班长，你再念一遍吧！”当方福生念完了第三遍，一个名叫新泰的年轻战士突然说：“班长，我好像看见了苹果，闻到了香味。”“班长，我也闻到了香味了。”方福生激动地放下报纸望着大家轻轻地说：“闻到了，我也闻到香味了。”他们都幸福地笑了，他们闻到了中朝友谊百花盛开的浓郁的芬芳。
    这三十只苹果，在福建前线，每一只都有着自己不平凡的经历，有着扣人心弦的故事。当我们在英雄的朝鲜访问了一个月，看到了跨上千里马的人民共和国，在劳动党和金日成首相的领导下所取得的光辉成就，看到了朝鲜人民在建设的道路上，排除万难，不屈不挠的无畏精神，看到了朝中两国人民与日俱增的友谊，看到了朝鲜人民对于领袖金日成首相衷心地爱戴，就使我更加深刻地理解：为什么三十只朝鲜的苹果，在中国的福建前线，那样激动着我们，产生了那样巨大的力量。
