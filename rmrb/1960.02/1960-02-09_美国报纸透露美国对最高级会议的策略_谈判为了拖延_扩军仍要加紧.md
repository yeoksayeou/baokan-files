Xinhua News Agency, 5th, Washington Dispatch: Some U.S. government officials and propaganda machines are indicating that the U.S. will seek to create obstacles at the upcoming four-power summit meeting in May, employing delaying tactics to obstruct the resolution of important issues.

At a symposium on national security issues for American women held in Washington on January 29, Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs, Burding, said in his speech that "the upcoming summit may not make a final decision on the major issues that divide the world." He said, "A series of summits may last for several years."

Burding also emphasized that the United States "must not have too high expectations for each stage of the negotiations" and "must not rush to reach an agreement for the sake of reaching an agreement." He also advocated that the United States continue to actively expand its armaments, saying that the United States "must maintain a strong defense" during negotiations, and "the military capabilities of the United States and our allies must be maintained at a level that is clearly sufficient."

United Press International reporter Potts pointed out that "the Eisenhower administration, with the help of the French and West German governments, has begun a propaganda campaign to prepare the public for the failure of the four-power summit in May." He said, "Republican leaders are worried that if the Paris meeting reaches a deadlock or worse, it will damage the Republican Party's 'peace and prosperity' election platform if voters have too many expectations for the meeting."

Another American bourgeois journalist, Higgins, clearly pointed out on February 1 that the United States would try to obstruct the meeting from reaching an agreement. He wrote that in the coming weeks, various measures will be taken to cool down those who believe that the May 16 meeting will make some great decisions. Another commentator, Hensley, said that the United States has decided to adopt a strategy of minimizing the significance of the meeting, and Burding's speech at the Washington Women's Symposium was the first shot in this movement.

Associated Press reporter Hightower even said that "current indications suggest" that "the upcoming negotiations are likely to be severe and dangerous, rather than easing tensions and reaching an agreement."

    美国报纸透露美国对最高级会议的策略
    谈判为了拖延  扩军仍要加紧
    新华社5日讯　华盛顿消息：美国的一些政府官员和宣传机器都表示，美国将设法在5月间即将召开的四国政府首脑会议上制造障碍，施行拖延战术以阻挠重要问题的解决。
    在1月29日在华盛顿举行的美国妇女关于国家安全问题的座谈会上，美国公共事务助理国务卿伯丁在他的演说里说，“即将到来的最高级会议可能不会就使世界分裂的重大问题作出最后决定。”他说，“一系列的最高级会议可能持续数年之久。”
    伯丁还强调美国在谈判中“一定不要对每一阶段的谈判期望过高”，“不要为了达成协议而急急忙忙达成协议”。他并且鼓吹美国继续积极扩军备战，他说，美国在谈判时“必须保持强大的防务”，“美国和我们盟国的军事能力必须保持在显然是足够的水平上”。
    合众国际社记者波茨就此指出，“艾森豪威尔政府在法国和西德政府的帮助下，已经开始了一个使公众对5月的四大国最高级会议有失败准备的宣传运动”。他说，“共和党的首脑们担心，如果巴黎会议陷于僵局或者更坏的话，这将会损害共和党的‘和平和繁荣’的选举纲领，要是选民对这次会议寄予太多期望的话。”
    美国另一资产阶级记者希金斯2月1日就明白地指出美国将设法阻挠会议达成协议。他写道，在今后几周中，将采取各种措施使那些认为5月16日的会议会作出某种伟大决定的人的头脑冷静下来。另一个评论员亨斯莱说，美国已经决定采取缩小会议意义的战略，而伯丁在华盛顿妇女座谈会上的讲话则是这个运动放出的第一枪。
    美联社记者海托华甚至说，“现在的迹象表明”，“即将举行的谈判大概是严厉的和危险的，而不是缓和的和达成协议的。”
