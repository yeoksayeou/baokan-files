    Shanghai Brand, Welcome You!
    By our reporter Zhou Yongkang
    "Shanghai goods" – the mere mention of these three words naturally brings to mind various daily necessities produced in Shanghai, such as fountain pens, mugs, toys, and thermos bottles. During the Great Leap Forward of the past two years, Shanghai has also seen the emergence of numerous new products marked with the "Shanghai Brand." These light industrial products, while also Shanghai goods, are different from the general Shanghai goods; they are all high-end products. These products signify that the technological level of Shanghai's light industry is leaping forward in the direction of high-end and precision.
    
    "Hero" Yields Its Place
    Among the high-end products in Shanghai's light industry that have caught up with international advanced levels, the most familiar to people is the "100" model Hero fountain pen. After more than a year of effort, the Shanghai Huafu Pen Factory, last year, brought the Hero fountain pen up to the level of the American Parker pen in terms of actual use. But today, the Hero fountain pen has had to cede the throne of national champion to the Shanghai brand fountain pen, which has come from behind.
    
    The Shanghai brand fountain pen is also a product of the Huafu Pen Factory and began mass production before last year's National Day. At that time, they used the method of comparing the quality of "Hero" and "Parker" pens from the first half of last year to compare "Shanghai" and "Hero" pens. As a result, the quality of the Shanghai brand fountain pen far exceeded that of the Hero fountain pen. In the past, the average leakage temperature difference of the Hero fountain pen was 38 degrees, 3 degrees higher than the Parker pen, while the lowest of the Shanghai brand fountain pen was 40 degrees, generally around 45 degrees. In the past, when Parker pens were placed in a closed intermittent writing tester and blown with hot air for half an hour, only five out of ten pens could still write, while eight Hero pens could. However, every Shanghai brand fountain pen leaving the factory could meet this requirement.
    
    Fighting for Every Second
    Walking into the Shanghai Watch Factory, which has undergone three factory relocations and expansions, one sees rows of precision lathes, turning quickly and quietly, many of which have various microscopes attached. Some of the screws being turned on the lathes are so small that their diameter is only half the size of a pinhead.
    
    In the inspection room, technicians place a gear the size of a match head in a testing device, magnify it a hundred times, and then use a template to check the precision of each gear, ensuring that the error of each tooth on the gear does not exceed one-seventh of the thickness of a strand of hair.
    
    This is how the workers strive for the accuracy of every second of the watch. Last year, the factory's watches already achieved an error of only one minute per day, with the best being only half a minute off. This year, they strive to reduce the error of all watches to within 45 seconds.
    
    A Feast for the Ears and Eyes
    The various radios produced by the Shanghai Broadcasting Equipment Factory in the past were also called "Shanghai Brand," but the several Shanghai Brand high-end radios produced recently are very different from those of the past.
    
    There is a seven-tube superheterodyne radio that is very beautiful in appearance and has a very sophisticated mechanism structure. It has a total of four speakers, with high, mid, and low ranges, giving a stereo feeling when listening, and without the tonal distortion that is common in ordinary radios. The radio also has a rotating active antenna that can be adjusted at any time according to the direction of the radio waves, improving reception efficiency. The four-band switches are like piano keys, when one is pressed, the other will automatically jump up, which is very clever.
    
    The Shanghai Broadcasting Equipment Factory is not only trying to provide a feast for the ears, but also trying to provide a feast for the eyes. The first batch of Shanghai Brand eighteen-tube televisions produced by the factory began to be supplied to the market a month ago.
    
    This type of television has a total of five channels, with precise circuitry and structure, and the black and white levels are very clear when listening to and watching television programs.
    
    "Omnipotent Base"
    The above are just a few examples of products. Other products such as "Shanghai Brand" cameras and "Shanghai Brand" film, like watches, fill the gaps in China's light industry. In addition, there are many products such as "August 1st" racing cars, universal sewing machines, double-lid thermos bottles, Golden Leaf perfume, and electric toys, which, although not called "Shanghai Brand," also signify the technological level of Shanghai's light industry. For example, the China Record Factory recently trial-produced the first 8 rpm microgroove record. Compared with the original 78 rpm record, the same record (both sides) can be extended from only seven or eight minutes in the past to two and a half hours, which is most suitable for recording various longer-duration Peking operas, pingtan, and symphonies.
    
    The mass production of these many high-end and precision products has ended the history of Shanghai's daily necessities industry, which for more than a hundred years could only produce cigarettes, soap, mugs, and thermos bottles, and has transformed it into a new technological base for light industry that can make everything and make everything well.
    
    And the successful trial production and mass production of one high-end new product after another is like atomic nuclear fission, causing a reaction with an increasingly large scope. The mass production of watches and cameras requires the glass industry to produce a large number of gem glass and optical glass, and the Shanghai No. 1 Optical Glass Factory was born last year under such requirements. In order to cooperate with film factories and record factories in manufacturing color film and microgroove records, the chemical industry department has recently been actively expanding the production of various high-end plastics and other chemical raw materials. The scope of supporting facilities for high-end products is also constantly expanding. After the camera is manufactured, the exposure meter, tripod, and ten-thousand-flash, which serve the camera, are all being trial-produced or are in production. The variety of microgroove records is constantly increasing, and variable-speed record players that adapt to various speeds of records are also being mass-produced. All of this is outlining a beautiful picture of the prosperous and high-speed leap forward of China's socialist construction.

### 上海牌，欢迎你！

    上海牌，欢迎你！
    本报记者　周永康
    “上海货”，只要一提到这三个字，人们就会很自然地想到上海生产的钢笔、口杯、玩具、热水瓶等各种各样的日用百货。在最近两年的大跃进中，上海又出现了许许多多以“上海牌”为标记的新产品。这些轻工业品虽然也是上海货，但是不同于一般的上海货，它们都是高级产品。这些产品标志着上海轻工业的技术水平，正在向高级、精密的方向跃进。
    “英雄”让位
    上海轻工业中，赶上国际先进水平的高级产品，人们最熟悉的，要算“100”号英雄金笔了。上海华孚金笔厂经过一年多的努力，在去年，使英雄金笔在实际使用方面赶上了美国的派克金笔。但是到今天，英雄金笔已不得不把全国冠军的宝座，让给后来居上的上海牌金笔了。
    上海牌金笔也是华孚金笔厂的产品，去年国庆节前已经开始大量生产。当时，他们用去年上半年对比“英雄”和“派克”两种金笔质量的办法，把“上海”和“英雄”两种金笔作了比较。结果，上海牌金笔的质量大大超过了英雄金笔。过去英雄金笔的漏水温差平均在三十八度，比派克笔高三度，而上海牌金笔最低的也在四十度，一般都在四十五度左右。过去派克笔放在密闭的间歇书写测定仪里，用热风吹上半小时，十支笔只有五支笔仍能写出字迹，而英雄金笔有八支，可是出厂的上海牌金笔，支支都能达到这样的要求。
    分秒必争
    走进经过三次迁厂扩建的上海手表厂，只见一排排精密的车床，声音很轻地在飞快地转动着，很多机床上还有各种不同的显微镜。有些车床上车的螺丝，直径小得只有一根大头针的一半。
    检验室里的技术员把一个只有火柴头那样大小的齿轮，放在测验器里，放大一百倍，再用样板去核对每个齿轮的精密度，一定要使齿轮上的每个齿都做到误差不超过一根头发丝的七分之一。
    工人们就是这样争取手表一分一秒的准确。去年，这个厂的手表已经做到每天只差一分钟，最好的只相差半分钟。今年，他们争取把全部手表的误差降低到四十五秒之内。
    耳目之福
    上海广播器材厂过去生产的各种收音机，也都叫“上海牌”，但是最近生产的几种上海牌高级收音机，和过去的又大不相同。
    有一种七灯一级收音机，外观十分漂亮，机件结构非常讲究。它一共有四个喇叭，有高音、中音、低音三种，收听时有立体的感觉，而且没有一般收音机常有的音调失真的现象。收音机里还有一个转动式的活动天线，可以随时根据电波方向加以调节，提高接受效率。四个波段的开关像钢琴琴键一样，一个按下去，另一个会自动跳上来，非常灵巧。
    上海广播器材厂既设法让人饱耳福，也设法让人饱眼福。这个厂生产的第一批上海牌十八灯电视机，已经在一个月前开始供应市场了。
    这种电视机共有五个波道，线路、结构制造精密，在收听和观看电视节目时，黑白层次都很清楚。
    “万能基地”
    上面介绍的只是几种产品，其他像“上海牌”照相机、“上海牌”胶卷等，都像手表一样，补起了我国轻工业的空白点。另外，还有许多产品如“八一”赛车、万能缝纫机、双盖热水瓶、金叶香水、电动玩具等，它们虽然不叫“上海牌”，但是也同样标志着上海轻工业的技术水平。例如，中国唱片厂最近试制出来了第一张每分钟只转八转的密纹唱片。这种唱片和原来的二十八转唱片比较，同样一张（两面），可以从过去只能听七、八分钟延长到两个半小时，最适合用来灌制各种时间较长的京剧、评弹和交响乐。
    这许许多多高级、精密产品的大量生产，使上海日用品工业结束了一百多年来只能做些香烟、肥皂、口杯、热水瓶的历史，而变成了一个样样能做、样样都精的轻工业新技术基地。
    而一个个高级新产品的试制成功和大量生产，又好像原子核分裂一样，引起了越来范围越大的反应。手表、照相机的大量生产，要求玻璃工业拿出大批宝石玻璃和光学玻璃，上海第一光学玻璃厂去年就在这样的要求下诞生了。化学工业部门为了配合胶卷厂、唱片厂制造彩色胶卷和密纹唱片，最近在积极扩大各种高级塑料和其他化工原料的生产。围绕高级产品的配套范围也在不断扩大。照相机制成以后，为照相机服务的爆光表、三角架、万次闪光灯，都在试制的试制，生产的生产；密纹唱片的品种不断增加，适应各种不同速度唱片的变速唱机也在大量制造。这一切的一切，正钩画出我国社会主义建设欣欣向荣、高速度跃进的美好图景。
