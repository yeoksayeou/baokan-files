Establishing the Viewpoint of Serving Agriculture
The Anyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

Under the guidance of the Party's policy of taking steel as the key link, our city has given full play to the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and staff, not only completing the state production plan ahead of schedule and in an over-all manner, but also making certain achievements and accumulating some experience in industry supporting agriculture and cities supporting the countryside. Through years of practice, especially in the past two years, we have deeply realized that the development of the national economy must be based on agriculture, and we must implement the policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry combined with the rapid development of agriculture. Both light and heavy industries must serve to promote agricultural development. From the perspective of our city's industrial production, approximately 70% of the raw materials come from the countryside, and more than 80% of the industrial products' sales market is also in the countryside. Therefore, only with the great development of agriculture can we more forcefully promote the great development of industry.

A Great Agricultural Harvest Leads to Great Industrial Development

Facts prove that industry and agriculture are mutually conditional, mutually promoting, and mutually supporting. The great development of industry in our city has always been accompanied by a great agricultural harvest. In 1953, there was a great agricultural harvest, and in 1954, our city's industry experienced a situation of great development. In 1955, there was a great agricultural harvest, and in 1956, industry again achieved great development. The great agricultural harvests in 1957 and 1958 promoted the continuous great leap forward of industry in 1958 and 1959. Therefore, we have always attached great importance to industry supporting agriculture. In recent years, we have continuously organized materials exchange conferences to promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and to support agricultural production. Moreover, every year, we organize forces to visit and investigate the countryside in order to understand and meet the needs of the countryside for production and living materials. In 1958 and 1959, this was further developed into the form of holding industrial, agricultural, and commercial collaboration meetings, where commercial departments and rural areas jointly formulate commodity demand plans and rationally arrange industrial production, which was warmly welcomed by the peasant masses. Especially after the policy of developing the national economy with agriculture as the foundation was proposed, we more boldly mobilized the masses and rapidly launched a mass movement of industry supporting agriculture throughout the city. According to statistics, in 1959, the city's machinery industry produced a total of 21,143 agricultural machines, more than 1.08 million various small agricultural tools, repaired and fitted 210,000 various mechanical parts, and cultivated 3,210 various technical personnel for agriculture. Last year, the total value of production and living materials supplied to the countryside reached 121.8 million yuan, including various sprayers, corn threshers, small steel mills, waterwheels, water pumps, small power machinery, and many new-style agricultural tools and machinery such as walking plows and close-planting drills. This played a great role in promoting agriculture to overcome natural disasters, gradually realize agricultural technical transformation, and ensure a great agricultural harvest.

Treat Serving Agriculture as a Strategic Task

Strengthening the Party's leadership, adhering to putting politics in command, and establishing the viewpoint of serving agriculture are the primary prerequisites for doing a good job in industry supporting agriculture. According to the instructions of the Provincial and Regional Party Committees, we have vigorously carried out propaganda and education work on industry supporting agriculture and cities supporting the countryside among the masses of the people throughout the city. Through methods such as reports, organizing mass discussions, studying documents, and visiting the countryside, we repeatedly explained to the workers and staff the policy of developing the national economy with agriculture as the foundation and combining the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture. We mobilized the workers and staff to discuss the relationship between industry and agriculture in light of the situation of their own factories. Through education and discussion, everyone realized that industry supporting agriculture is a major issue related to the implementation of the Party's general line for socialist construction and the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture. It is a matter of gradually realizing agricultural technical transformation, realizing agricultural modernization, and a long-term strategic task during the period of socialist construction. This resolved the muddled thinking of some cadres who believed that if the national economy is based on agriculture, is industry no longer important? Will industry supporting agriculture affect the development of industry? We produce products that do not directly serve agriculture, so how can we support agriculture? The workers and staff of the Anyang Medium-sized Machinery Factory, through recalling and analyzing the development of their factory over the years due to serving agriculture, realized that developing agriculture can not only promote the development of light industry but also promote the development of heavy industry. Before 1953, this factory was still a small tool factory with only a few baking ovens and dozens of people. With the completion of the rural land reform and the liberation of productive forces, they quickly developed from a small tool factory into a small machinery factory with more than 200 people and more than a dozen precision lathes thanks to consecutive great agricultural harvests. Immediately following the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, they accepted the task of manufacturing new-style agricultural tools such as double-wheeled double-shared plows, which further enabled them to rapidly grow into a machinery manufacturing factory with more than 700 people and nearly 100 precision equipment. In 1958, due to the realization of people's communes, which promoted a continued great agricultural harvest, this factory further developed into the current medium-sized machine tool manufacturing factory with more than 2,200 people and more than 200 modern equipment. With the improvement of ideological understanding, the broad masses of workers and staff have all written guarantees to the Party, determined to do everything possible to support agriculture. After clarifying the great significance of industry supporting agriculture, the workers and staff of the pesticide factory revised the plan to produce 12,000 tons of chemical fertilizer per year to 20,000 tons; if there is no foreign machinery, then we will use indigenous methods. In the first twenty days of January, they produced more than sixty tons of superphosphate and calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer. In order to support agricultural needs, the General Machinery Factory has now resumed the production of products such as horseshoes and hoe blades. Initially, some workers were unwilling to make this kind of product, believing that making precision products could improve technology. Now, many workers are vying to do it, willing to contribute more to supporting agriculture. The Agricultural Machinery Factory originally had a very heavy production task and did not have time to do odd jobs, but in order to better support agriculture, they extracted more than 30 workers from the workshop to form a repair and fitting group, specializing in repairing and fitting odd jobs for various communes. In a short period of time, they repaired and fitted 4,721 various agricultural tools and accessories for various communes. The commercial departments, through studying documents, talking about the situation, sending personnel to visit the countryside, checking inventories, and calculating overall accounts, overcame the ideas of fearing losses, fearing stockpiles, and fearing trouble, and also quickly launched a large-scale great competition upsurge to support agricultural production and water conservancy construction. These facts prove that as long as we constantly strengthen the education of workers and staff on industry supporting agriculture, we can not only mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses to support agriculture, but also promote the increase production and practice economy movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution to develop in a broader and deeper direction.

Overall Planning and Strengthened Leadership

Industry supporting agriculture, like other work, must formulate an overall plan and proceed in a planned and purposeful manner. In formulating the plan, we must base ourselves on the policy of developing the national economy with agriculture as the foundation, and combine it with the situation of our own enterprise, so that the production of our enterprise is suitable for the needs of the countryside. The projects and methods of our city in supporting agriculture can be summarized into five words: manufacture, repair, process, teach, and help. "Manufacture" is to vigorously manufacture various machinery and agricultural tools needed by agriculture. The city has arranged a total of 37,940 units of small power machinery, drainage and irrigation machinery, cultivation machinery, and transportation vehicles for the entire year. "Repair" is to strengthen the repair and fitting work of agricultural machinery and agricultural tools. First, it is necessary to expand the repair and fitting network. Last year, due to the needs of drought resistance, we established 13 temporary repair and fitting factories, 154 repair and fitting stations, and 349 repair and fitting points. This year, we must consolidate and expand them. Secondly, we also organized five strong repair and fitting groups to go to the countryside to conduct mobile repair and fitting. "Process" is to organize the processing of agricultural products and vigorously carry out comprehensive utilization work. "Teach" is to train various technical personnel for agriculture. On the one hand, we send technical personnel or skilled workers to various communes to conduct technical guidance; on the other hand, the various communes send people, and the factories provide training. "Help" is to go down to help with wheat harvesting, weeding, and cotton picking during the summer harvest, summer planting, and the "three autumns" (autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing); and to help with water conservancy construction in winter.

Adjusting Industrial Layout to Suit Agricultural Needs

According to the requirements of industry supporting agriculture, we have strengthened the technical transformation of old enterprises that directly serve agriculture, so that old enterprises can develop towards manufacturing more advanced products and towards a more comprehensive direction, in order to produce more high-quality and low-priced products to supply the needs of the vast countryside. County and commune industries have a wide distribution and are most closely related to agricultural production, so we have paid special attention to giving play to the role of county and commune industries in industry supporting agriculture work. Only in this way can we provide more powerful support to agriculture. The method of arming county and commune industries is to go from indigenous to foreign, from point to surface, and to develop in an all-round way with large, medium, and small sizes. In 1959, the city had already provided county and commune industries with more than 100 units of equipment such as lathes, electric motors, and transformers. Before the Spring Festival, it took out another 150 lathes to support the countryside. The thirty machinery factories of the city's twenty-six communes will gradually be transformed from "small indigenous groups" into "small foreign groups," creating a good material foundation for accelerating the realization of agricultural technical transformation.

Workers, Peasants, and Merchants Join Hands and Leap Forward Together

Commercial work is the link connecting industry and agriculture, and is the logistics department and "intelligence agency" for industry supporting agriculture. In 1959, we held several industrial, agricultural, and commercial collaboration meetings, which achieved good results. By adopting this method, we can combine understanding the needs of agricultural production, appropriately arranging industrial production, and solving the problem of industrial production raw materials together, and join hands and leap forward together. At the same time, we can also give full play to the initiative of the commercial departments. After the industrial, agricultural, and commercial collaboration meeting in October last year, commerce solved 369 kinds of raw materials for industry, which not only solved the needs of industry, but also expanded the source of products and supported agriculture with sufficient materials. After the high tide of water conservancy construction, commercial workers organized 105 county and commune factories to produce more than 950,000 water conservancy tools, which timely supported water conservancy construction. Recently, they dispatched 11 people to conduct a survey in the plains and mountainous communes, and found that after the widespread close planting of wheat, there is a need for a large number of narrow hoe blades; after the realization of garden-style fields, many new tools are also needed. They timely reflected these opinions to the factories and arranged production according to the needs of the countryside.

With the deepening development of the mass movement of industry supporting agriculture, we have also organized factories and communes to have fixed cooperative objects, directly linked up, and contracted to provide support, which has further strengthened the relationship between workers and peasants. This is a good method for industry supporting agriculture to become institutionalized and regularized. Therefore, since the implementation of this method, the relationship between urban and rural areas has become closer and the feelings between workers and peasants have been enhanced.

    树立为农业服务的观点
    中共安阳市委员会
    我市在党的以钢为纲的方针指导下，充分发挥了广大职工群众的革命热情，不仅提前超额全面地完成了国家生产计划，而且在工业支援农业、城市支援农村方面也做出了一定的成绩，积累了一些经验。通过多年来特别是近两年来的实践，使我们深刻体会到，国民经济的发展必须以农业为基础，必须贯彻执行优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业相结合的方针，轻、重工业都必须为促进农业发展服务。从我市工业生产来看，70％左右的原料来自农村，80％以上的工业品销售市场也在农村，所以只有农业的大发展，才能更有力地促进工业的大发展。
    农业大丰收　工业大发展
    事实证明，工业和农业是互为条件，互相促进，互相支援的。我市工业的大发展，总是伴随着农业大丰收同时而来。1953年农业大丰收，1954年我市工业就出现了大发展的形势，1955年农业大丰收，1956年工业又获得了大发展，1957年和1958年农业大丰收，又促进了1958年和1959年工业的连续大跃进。因此，我们对于工业支援农业一向是较为重视的。几年来，曾不断组织物资交流大会，促进城乡物资交流，支援农业生产。并且每年都组织力量到农村访问调查，以便了解和满足农村对生产、生活资料的需要。1958年和1959年又发展为召开工、农、商协作会议形式，由商业部门和农村共同制订要货计划，合理安排工业生产，受到了农民群众的热烈欢迎。特别是提出发展国民经济必须以农业为基础的方针以后，我们更放手发动群众，在全市迅速掀起了工业支援农业的群众运动。据统计，1959年全市机械工业共生产农业机械二万一千一百四十三台，各种小件农具一百零八万多件，修配各种机械零件二十一万件，为农业培养各种技术人材三千二百一十人。去年供应农村生产、生活资料总值达一亿二千一百八十万元，其中包括有各种喷雾器、玉米脱粒机、小钢磨、水车、水泵、小型动力机械及步犁、密植耧等许多新式农具和机械，这对支援农业战胜自然灾害、逐步实现农业技术改造，保证农业大丰收起了很大促进作用。
    把为农业服务当作战略任务
    加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，树立为农业服务的观点，是搞好工业支援农业工作的首要前提。根据省委、地委指示，我们在全市人民群众中曾大张旗鼓地开展了工业支援农业、城市支援农村的宣传教育工作。通过报告、组织群众讨论、学习文件、到农村参观访问等方法，反复地向职工讲解发展国民经济以农业为基础，优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业相结合的方针，发动职工结合本厂情况讨论工业与农业的关系。经过教育和讨论，使大家认识到工业支援农业是有关贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线和工农业并举方针的重大问题，是逐步实现农业技术改造，实现农业现代化的问题，是社会主义建设时期一个长期的战略任务。从而解决了某些干部认为国民经济以农业为基础，是否工业不重要了；工业支援农业是否会影响工业的发展；我们生产的产品不是直接为农业服务的，无法支援农业等糊涂思想。安阳中型机械厂职工，通过回忆和分析本厂由于为农业服务获得历年来的发展情况，认识到发展农业不仅可以促进轻工业发展而且可以促进重工业发展。这个厂在1953年以前还是一个仅有几盘烘炉和几十个人的小工具厂，随着农村土地改革的完成，生产力的解放，农业连年大丰收，他们很快地由一个小工具厂发展为有两百多人和十几台精密车床的小型机械厂。紧接着农业合作化高潮的到来，他们又接受了双轮双铧犁等新式农具的制造任务，从而又使他们迅速壮大为拥有七百多人和近百台精密设备的机械制造厂；1958年由于实现了人民公社，促进了农业继续大丰收，这个厂又进而发展成为现在的二千二百多人和二百多台现代设备的中型机床制造厂了。广大职工随着思想认识的提高，都纷纷向党写保证书，决心尽一切力量支援农业。农药厂职工在明确了工业支援农业的重大意义后，将全年生产化肥一万二千吨的计划修改为二万吨；没有洋机器就土法上马。元月份头二十天就生产出过磷酸钙和钙镁磷肥六十多吨。通用机械厂为了支援农业需要，现在又恢复了马掌、锄板等产品的生产。开始有些工人不愿做这种产品，认为做精密产品才能提高技术，现在许多工人都抢着做，愿意为支援农业多贡献一份力量。农业机械厂本来生产任务很繁重，没有时间再做零活，可是为了更好地支援农业，他们从车间抽出三十多个工人成立了修配组，专门为各公社修配零活，在短短的时间内就为各公社修配各种农具和配件四千七百二十一件。商业部门通过学文件、讲形势、抽人员访问农村、查库存算大账等方法，克服了怕赔钱、怕积压、怕麻烦的思想，也迅速掀起了一个声势浩大的支援农业生产和水利建设的大竞赛高潮。这些事实证明，只要我们经常加强对职工进行工业支援农业的教育，不仅可以调动广大群众支援农业的积极性，而且也推动了以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，向更广泛、更深入的方向发展。
    全面规划　加强领导
    工业支援农业，和其他工作一样，必须制订全面规划，有计划有目的地进行。在制定规划中，必须根据发展国民经济以农业为基础的方针，结合本企业的情况，使自己企业的生产适合农村需要。我市支援农业的项目和方法，可以概括为五个字：制、修、加、教、帮。“制”是大力制造为农业所需要的各种机械和农具。全市全年共安排小型动力机械、排灌机械、耕作机械和交通运输车辆等三万七千九百四十台。“修”就是要加强对农业机械和农具的修配工作。首先要扩大修配网，去年由于抗旱的需要，我们建立了临时修配厂十三个，修配站一百五十四个，修配点三百四十九个，今年必须巩固和扩大。其次，还组织五个强有力的修配组下乡，巡回修配。“加”就是组织农产品加工，大搞综合利用工作。“教”就是为农业培训各种技术人材。一面派出技术人员或技术工人到各公社进行技术辅导；一面由各公社抽人，工厂代为培训。“帮”就是夏收夏种和“三秋”期间下去帮助割麦、锄草、摘棉花；冬季帮助搞水利建设等。
    适合农业需要调整工业布局
    根据工业支援农业的要求，我们加强了为农业直接服务的老企业的技术改造，使老企业向制造比较高级的产品，向比较全面的方向发展，以生产更多的物美价廉的产品，供应广大农村需要。县、社工业分布面广，同农业生产关系最密切，所以我们在工业支援农业工作中，特别注意了发挥县、社工业的作用。只有这样才能对农业进行更有力的支援。武装县、社工业的方法是由土到洋，由点到面，大中小型全面发展。1959年全市已为县、社工业提供了百余台车床、电动机、变压器等设备，在春节前又拿出一百五十台车床支援农村。我市二十六个公社的三十个机械厂将逐步由“小土群”变成“小洋群”，为加速实现农业技术改造，创造了良好的物质基础。
    工农商同心协力携手跃进
    商业工作是联系工业和农业的纽带，是工业支援农业的后勤部和“情报机关”。1959年我们召开了几次工农商协作会，取得了良好效果。采用这种方法，可以把了解农业生产需要，适当安排工业生产和解决工业生产原料问题等三者结合在一起，同心协力，携手跃进。同时，还可以充分发挥商业部门的主动性。去年10月工农商协作会议后，商业为工业解决各种原料三百六十九种，不仅解决了工业的需要，而且扩大了产品来源，用充足的物资支援了农业。水利建设高潮以后，商业职工就组织一百零五个县、社工厂，生产水利工具九十五万余件，及时支援了水利建设。最近他们又抽调十一人到平原、山区公社作了一次调查，发现小麦普遍密植后，需用大量窄锄板；实现园田化后，也需要许多新工具，他们就及时把这些意见反映给工厂，按照农村需要，安排了生产。
    随着工业支援农业群众运动的深入发展，我们还组织了工厂与公社固定协作对象、直接挂钩、包干进行支援的办法，进一步密切了工农关系。这是工业支援农业形成制度化、经常化的良好方法。因此自实行这个办法以来，更密切了城乡关系，增进了工农之间的感情。
