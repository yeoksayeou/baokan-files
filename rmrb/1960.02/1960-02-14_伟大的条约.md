    The Great Treaty
    Tikhonov, Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee and Vice-Chairman of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
    Today is the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, an unprecedented treaty in world history. After the treaty was signed, Comrade Mao Zedong said that the fraternal alliance between the Chinese and Soviet people "will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of China and the Soviet Union, but will also inevitably affect the future of mankind and the victory of peace and justice throughout the world."
    The past ten years have proved that the unbreakable alliance between our two peoples has become a major factor in the development of world history. The solidarity of the Soviet Union, China, and the fraternal socialist countries has repeatedly blocked the path of war instigators. The Sino-Soviet alliance is the foundation for the unity of the world socialist system.
    The whole world has seen that this treaty is built on the foundation of justice, mutual understanding, and creatively friendly unity. It has already yielded fruitful results.
    Everyone who has visited China recently has seen with their own eyes how much life has changed since the fighters for the future faced the magnificent plan to transform the country a long time ago.
    When you know that the main indicators of the Second Five-Year Plan have been achieved three years ahead of schedule, and see metallurgists and miners, machine builders and new hydropower station builders, farmers and workers, production innovators and scientists chasing each other and keeping pace, your heart is full of joy.
    You see thousands upon thousands of enthusiastic people for whom nothing is impossible. You see labor heroes who do not think their heroic deeds are anything remarkable. They know that there are many talented people around them, many patriots, and thousands upon thousands of Communist Party members who, in the great battle of labor, fight tirelessly, just as their fathers and grandfathers fought for freedom in the unprecedented years of war.
    Not long ago, I went to Beijing with a delegation from the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Those of us who had seen Beijing six or seven years ago no longer recognized the city. It had become unrecognizable. One cannot even say that it has become younger. The new Beijing *is* young. Its magnificent new buildings show that the talent of inexhaustible and tireless people can create miracles. The Great Hall of the People, the Revolutionary Museum, the new Beijing Railway Station, the Broadcasting Building, public places, hotels, residences..., these buildings are more magnificent than the other. The number of workers in the capital has increased tenfold, from 80,000 in 1949 to 880,000 in 1959.
    We visited various places. Everywhere, the laboring spirit was boiling. Inland river ships marched in formation along the wide river. New factories and iron and steel complexes were erected, bridges and roads were built, people's communes gained unprecedented bumper harvests, various research institutes investigated underground and mountain treasures, searching for new producing areas of oil, coal, and non-ferrous metals in desolate and remote areas, cultivating new species of cattle and sheep, patients received medical treatment, and everywhere people were learning, learning, learning...
    I cannot help but recall Comrade Khrushchev's speech at the banquet celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country in Beijing. He said: "Now, the vigorous development of socialist countries is irresistible, and such development makes the heads of capitalism panic. They admit that the example of the great People's China's victorious advance in the development of industry, agriculture, and culture is exerting a huge influence on Asian and African countries. Seeing the victorious advance of the People's China, people in other countries want to learn and hope to achieve the same great achievements, but the enemies of socialism are panic-stricken and worried about the fate of capitalism. Now, everyone recognizes the achievements made by the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party."
    People's China has completed the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. This is a great joy for us Soviets. We have done everything in our power to help our dear brothers who are advancing with heroic strides.
    Therefore, we often recall with cherish the fact that ten years have not been spent in vain, these ten years have flown by in common work shoulder to shoulder. Many skilled Soviet experts were sent to China. Chinese engineers and workers studied profound production knowledge in the Soviet Union. Many Soviet factories have become crucibles for cadres, from which experts for China's future industrial enterprises are trained. For Soviet experts, the Chinese people are their friends and brothers. They, the sons and daughters of the Soviet people, are fundamentally different from the engineers of Western countries who go to so-called colonial countries with a sense of national superiority. When they work, they do not act as teachers, but as brothers.
    I cannot but praise these people of the Soviet state, the first group of consultants - experts who went to China. So, I decided to write a poem praising them:
    Inspired by the people's trust,
    Summoned by common ideals,
    They used their own example and ideas,
    To help Chinese brothers.
    Building large factories,
    Baking ovens according to Soviet methods,
    Using the latest technology to make steel,
    Manufacturing all kinds of machine tools.
    Building huge dikes,
    Preventing floods,
    On the magical big river,
    Building fairytale-like bridges.
    In the uninhabited wilderness,
    Searching for oil and coal mines.
    The industrious Chinese people,
    Do not understand what is called "difficulty",
    On the vast and boundless plains,
    The land has become one piece,
    New combine harvesters are harvesting crops,
    Racing on the fields of the commune.
    In those glorious days,
    Quiet, strong, and uncommunicative,
    Soviet experts - consultants,
    They became poets,
    In order to break the old habits,
    In order to create magnificent poems,
    Poems of People's China,
    They contributed their strength.
    In order to help their Chinese brothers, in the Soviet Union, many experts worked enthusiastically and dedicated all their knowledge. For example, sixty factories in twenty cities in the Soviet Union produced equipment for the Luoyang Tractor Factory. How much equipment did Leningrad alone provide to China! More than 150 scientific research institutions and enterprises in Leningrad provided technical data to People's China. The Wuhan Iron and Steel Company is very familiar with Soviet friends - architects and metallurgical experts. How many Stavropol turners and technicians became acquainted with Chinese friends in the southern region of China when they established repair bases, trained turners, fitters, tractor drivers, root diggers, and shrub removers for China.
    Fishery experts taught Chinese brothers how to pickle fish; geologists searched for oil for Chinese brothers; agronomists were busy in the fields of Chinese brothers. The locomotive of friendship pulls long trains on newly laid tracks. The road of friendship stretches every day. I want to travel along the new road of friendship from Alma-Ata to Lanzhou, and my long-cherished wish will soon be realized because the road construction is progressing very well. Soviet experts have no secrets from Chinese comrades.
    The common work that future generations will also be proud of is truly full of poetry when recalled: Soviet experts and Chinese friends planted new gardens and parks together. The trees of friendship, like the evergreen friendship between our two peoples, are lush with shade. The once uninhabited grassland in the Hejiang area of Heilongjiang Province is today the vast land of the Friendship Farm, where how much land has been worked together by the people of China and the Soviet Union. The residents of Heilongjiang Province have the closest contact with the Soviet people. They: This is friendship that flows endlessly like the water of the Heilongjiang River. When the Chinese had difficulties, the Soviets came to support them, and the Soviets helped them build 22 industrial enterprises.
    This is why mutual understanding and mutual love are so profound. Please listen to a few words from Comrade Zeng Yangqing, Director of the First Steelmaking Plant of the Anshan Iron and Steel Complex and an outstanding people's expert, about Soviet expert Laniko: "For more than two years, he has been my teacher and my closest friend. I have shared weal and woe with him."
    Today is exactly the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. Are not the various provisions of this remarkable treaty based on the formula of sharing weal and woe in this pure friendship!
    Chinese students and trainees in Moscow or Leningrad are also warmly received, just like the Soviets in China.
    In this way, the first mythical bridge over the Yangtze River can be built, fast electronic computers and motors can be made, dyeing fabrics with ultrasonic waves can be made possible, and a base for rocket technology, biophysics, and electricity can be established.
    It is precisely because of this that it is so natural and touching that many Soviet consultants and experts have been awarded the Sino-Soviet Friendship Medal. They will never forget the selfless and noble work they have done during their stay in People's China. Our two peoples send scientists, various technical experts, actors, painters, and writers to each other. Climbers from China and the Soviet Union jointly conquered the highest peaks. Filmmakers from China and the Soviet Union jointly filmed films reflecting the friendship between our two peoples. The Soviets warmly welcomed the outstanding achievements of their Chinese brothers. Chinese friends also praised the Soviet Union's seven-year plan, the Soviet government's plan submitted to the United Nations for complete and thorough disarmament to permanently eliminate war, and the Soviet army's unilateral disarmament of 1.2 million people in accordance with the new law of January 1960.
    Our close friendship and cooperation is a guarantee of peace. Consolidating this friendship is to consolidate the strength of the entire socialist camp and the strength of all peace-loving forces in the world!
    This treaty of friendly alliance and mutual assistance also stipulates the prevention of all forces that dare to launch new aggression in the Far East in any form. This treaty has made the peace front stronger and immediately dwarfed the aggression front.
    Happy treaty, brotherly and friendly actions between the people of China and the Soviet Union! It means that all cultural, economic, trade and political ties have been greatly developed and will continue to develop for the benefit of our two countries and peoples.
    Long live the unbreakable friendship and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union!

### 伟大的条约

    伟大的条约
    苏联保卫和平委员会主席、苏中友好协会副主席　吉洪诺夫
    今天是世界历史上前所未有的条约——中苏友好同盟互助条约签订十周年的日子。条约签字以后，毛泽东同志说，苏中两国人民的兄弟同盟“不但必然要影响中苏两大国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到全世界和平与正义的胜利。”
    过去十年证明，我们两国人民的牢不可破的同盟成了世界历史发展的重大因素。苏联、中国和各兄弟社会主义国家的团结，多次地堵塞了战争挑拨者的道路。苏中同盟是世界社会主义体系团结一致的基础。
    全世界都看到，这个条约是在正义、互相谅解和创造力的友好团结的基础上建立起来的。它已经结下了丰硕的果实。
    每一个在最近期间访问过中国的人都亲眼看到，很久以前，当争取未来的战士面临着改造国家的宏伟计划时起，生活发生了多么大的变化。
    当你知道第二个五年计划的主要指标提前三年实现，看到冶金工人和矿工、机器制造者和新水电站建设者、农民和工人、生产革新者和科学家你追我赶，并驾齐驱的时候，心里充满了喜悦。
    你看到千千万万热情奔放的人，对他们来说，没有做不到的事情。你看到劳动英雄，他们并不认为自己的英雄事迹是什么了不起的事情。他们知道自己的周围有许许多多能人，许许多多爱国者，千千万万的共产党员，这些人在伟大的劳动的战役中，如同他们的父亲和祖父在史无前例的战争年代中为自由而战一样，不知疲倦地进行战斗。
    不久前，我同苏中友协代表团到了北京。我们这些六、七年前看见过北京的人，已经不认识这个城市了。它变得无法辨认了。甚至不能说他变得年青了。新的北京就是年青的。它那宏伟的新建筑表明，精力无穷无尽、不知疲倦的人民的才华能够创造奇迹。人民大会堂、革命博物馆、北京新火车站、广播大楼、公共场所、旅馆、住宅……，这些建筑物一个比一个壮丽。首都的工人增加了十倍，从1949年的八万人增加到1959年的八十八万人。
    我们到各地参观。意气风发的劳动处处沸腾。内河轮船沿着宽阔的江水鱼贯前进。耸立起新的工厂、钢铁联合企业，兴建了桥梁道路，人民公社获得空前大丰收，各个研究所考察了地下和山上的宝藏，在荒凉偏僻的地区寻找石油、煤炭、有色金属的新产地，培殖了新种的牛羊，病人得到医药疗理，到处都在学习，学习，学习……。
    我不由想起赫鲁晓夫同志在北京庆祝建国十周年的宴会上的讲话。他说：“现在，社会主义国家的蓬勃发展是不可阻挡的，这样的发展使得资本主义的头目们惊慌失措。他们承认，伟大的人民中国在发展工业、农业和文化方面胜利前进的例子正在给予亚非各国以巨大的影响。看到人民中国的胜利前进，其他国家的人民都很想学习，希望取得同样巨大的成就，但是，社会主义的敌人却恐慌万状，为资本主义的命运担忧。现在，大家都公认中国人民和中国共产党所取得的成就。”
    人民中国提前完成了第二个五年计划。这对我们苏联人来说是极大的喜事。我们尽了一切力量帮助踏着豪迈的步伐前进的亲爱的兄弟。
    因此，我们每每怀着珍惜的心情回想到，十年没有空度，这十年是在肩并肩的共同工作中飞逝的。苏联许多熟练的专家被派到中国。中国的工程师和工人在苏联研究深奥的生产知识。苏联许多工厂成了干部的熔炉，从这里培养出中国未来工业企业的专家。对苏联专家来说，中国人民是他们的朋友和兄弟。他们，苏联人民的儿女们，根本不同于那些怀着民族优越感去到所谓殖民地国家的西方国家的工程师。他们干工作的时候，不是作为老师，而是作为兄弟。
    我不能不歌颂苏维埃国家的这些人，到中国去的第一批顾问——专家。于是，我决定写一首歌颂他们的诗：
    为人民的重托鼓舞，
    为共同的思想感召，
    他们用自己的榜样和主意，
    帮助了中国兄弟。
    建设起一座座大工厂，
    按照苏联的方法烘炉，
    采用最新的技术炼钢，
    制造各式各样的机床。
    筑起巨大的堤防，
    防止洪水泛滥，
    在神奇的大河上，
    架起童话般的桥梁。
    在荒无人烟的旷野上，
    探寻石油和煤矿。
    勤劳的中国人民，
    不懂什么叫做“困难”，
    在遥阔无边的原野上，
    土地已经连成了一片，
    新的联合收割机在收割庄稼，
    奔驰在公社的田地上。
    在那些光荣的日子里，
    安静、坚强、不爱讲话的，
    苏联专家——顾问，
    他们变成了诗人，
    为了打破旧的习惯，
    为了创作壮丽的诗篇，
    人民中国的诗篇，
    他们把自己的力量贡献。
    为了帮助自己的中国兄弟，在苏联，有许多专家热情地劳动，献出自己的一切知识。例如：苏联有分布在二十个城市里的六十个工厂为洛阳拖拉机制造厂生产设备。仅仅列宁格勒就为中国提供了多少设备！列宁格勒有一百五十多个科学研究机关和企业为人民中国提供技术资料。武汉钢铁公司很熟悉苏联朋友们——建筑家和冶金专家。有多少斯塔甫罗波里的车工和技术员在中国南部地区为中国建立修理基地，培养车工、钳工和拖拉机手、掘根机手、灌木铲除机手的时候，结识了中国朋友。
    渔业专家向中国兄弟传授腌鱼的方法；地质学家为中国兄弟寻找石油；农学家忙碌在中国兄弟的田野上。友谊的机车拖着长长的列车在新铺设的路轨上行驶。友谊路天天伸延。我想望沿着新的友谊路由阿拉木图驶向兰州，我这个宿愿即将实现了，因为筑路工程进行得很好。苏联专家对中国同志没有任何秘密。
    使后代也感到光荣的共同工作，回忆起来真是充满了诗意：苏联专家和中国朋友们一起种植了新的花园和公园。友谊的树木，正如我们两国人民万古长青的友谊，翠绿成荫。黑龙江省合江专区过去荒无人烟的草原，今天是友谊农场的广阔田地，多少土地是苏中两国人们一起工作过的地方。黑龙江省的居民同苏联人交往最密切。他们：这是黑龙江水一样长流不息的友情。中国人有了困难，苏联人就来支援他们，苏联的人们帮助他们兴建了二十二座工业企业。
    这就是相互了解和相互爱戴为什么那样深远的原因。请听鞍山钢铁联合企业第一炼钢厂厂长、优秀的人民的专家曾扬清同志关于苏联专家拉尼科同志的几句话：“两年多来，他是我的老师，也是我最近的朋友。我和他同甘共苦。”
    今天刚好是中苏友好同盟互助条约签订十周年。这个卓越的条约的各个条款，又何尝不是以同甘共苦这个纯真友谊的公式为基础！
    在莫斯科或列宁格勒的中国留学生和进修生，也正如苏联人在中国一样受到热情的招待。
    这样，可以架起长江上第一座神话般的桥梁，可以制成快速电子计算机、电动机，可以使采用超声波染布成为可能，也可以建立火箭技术、生物物理学、电力学的基地。
    正因为如此，许多苏联顾问和专家荣获中苏友谊奖章是那样自然而动人。在人民中国期间所作的忘我的崇高的工作，他们将永志不忘。我们两国人民互派科学家、各种技术专家、演员、画家、作家。中苏两国的爬山运动员共同征服了最高大的山峰。苏中两国的电影工作者共同拍摄了反映我们两国人民友谊的影片。苏联人热情欢迎中国兄弟的卓越成就。中国朋友们也盛赞苏联的七年计划，苏联政府提交联合国的永远杜绝战争的全面彻底裁军计划，盛赞苏军根据1960年1月新法案采取的单方面裁军一百二十万人的行动。
    我们的亲密友谊与合作是和平的保证。巩固这种友谊就是巩固整个社会主义阵营的力量，巩固世界上所有爱好和平的力量！
    在这个友好同盟互助条约中还规定阻止一切敢于以任何形式在远东发动新侵略的势力。这个条约使和平阵线更加强大了，使侵略阵线立即相形减色。
    幸福的条约，苏中两国人民间兄弟的、友好的行动！它意味着一切文化的、经济的、贸易的、政治的联系得到了巨大的发展，而且将继续为我们两个国家和人民的利益不断发展。
    中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊和合作万岁！
