The meeting discussed and approved the 1960 national budget, and also passed a statement supporting the appeal of the Soviet Supreme Soviet to the parliaments and governments of all countries on the issue of disarmament.

    Czechoslovak Finance Minister Ďuriš presented a report on the 1960 national budget at the meeting. He said that the characteristic of this year's national budget is: on the basis of the rapid development of the national economy, the level of industrial production originally scheduled to be reached by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan (end of 1960) will likely be reached by the end of April this year.

    The reporter said that in this year's budget, the total budget revenue is 103.593 billion crowns, and the total expenditure is 103.406 billion crowns, resulting in a surplus of 187 million crowns. The entire year's budget has increased by 8.5% compared to last year.

    Ďuriš said that in the national budget revenue, 86% comes from the socialist sector of the national economy, while taxes paid by residents account for only 10.9% (11.7% last year). In the total budget expenditure, 49.6% will be used for the development of the national economy (47.7% last year), 39% will be used for the development of culture, education, healthcare, sports, and insurance, 8.5% will be allocated for national defense and security expenses (9.2% last year), and 2.9% will be used for administrative and court expenses.

    The reporter said that this year the country will pay special attention to the development of heavy machinery, the construction industry, and the transportation industry. In order to ensure the completion of the increased tasks in agriculture, agricultural allocations will increase by 8.6% compared to last year.

    When talking about last year's economic achievements, the report pointed out that its characteristic is that the broad masses of working people, under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, have made greater efforts to develop the national economy and strengthen socialist production relations.

    The meeting passed a statement on the appeal of the Soviet Supreme Soviet to the parliaments and governments of all countries. The statement believes that the Soviet Union's decision to substantially reduce its armed forces demonstrates the Soviet Union's willingness and sincerity to resolve the issue of disarmament.

    The statement pointed out the necessity of concluding a peace treaty with Germany, and severely condemned the aggressive and provocative policies of West German militarists.

    The statement believes that the recent meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty Member States in Moscow is a major contribution of socialist countries in strengthening the struggle for peace.

    Before the statement was passed, Czechoslovak Foreign Minister David and Defense Minister Lomský spoke at the meeting.

    捷国民议会通过今年国家预算
    支持苏联最高苏维埃裁军呼吁书
    新华社布拉格18日电　捷克斯洛伐克国民议会17日召开例会。会议讨论并通过了1960年国家预算，还通过了一项支持苏联最高苏维埃就裁军问题致世界各国议会和政府的呼吁书的声明。
    捷克斯洛伐克财政部长杜里什在会上作了1960年国家预算的报告。他说，今年国家预算的特点是：在迅速发展国民经济的基础上，原订要在第二个五年计划结束时（1960年底）达到的工业生产水平，很可能提前在今年4月底达到。
    报告人说，在今年预算中，预算总收入为一千零三十五亿九千三百万克朗，总支出为一千零三十四亿零六百万克朗，收支相抵将盈余一亿八千七百万克朗。今年全年预算比去年增加8．5％。
    杜里什说，在国家预算收入中，86％来自国民经济的社会主义部分，而居民所付的税款只占10．9％（去年为11．7％）。在预算总支出中，49．6％将用于发展国民经济（去年是47．7％），39％将用于发展文化、教育、保健、体育和保险事业，8．5％将拨作国防与安全费（去年为9．2％），2．9％为行政和法院经费。
    报告人说，今年国家将特别注意重型机械、建筑工业和运输业的发展。为了保证完成在农业方面已经增加的任务，农业的拨款将比去年增加8．6％。
    报告在谈到去年的经济成就时指出，其特点是广大劳动人民在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下，为发展国民经济和加强社会主义生产关系作出了更大的努力。
    会议就苏联最高苏维埃致世界各国议会和政府的呼吁书通过了一项声明。声明认为，苏联这次决定大量裁减武装部队表明了苏联愿意并有诚意解决裁军问题。
    声明指出了缔结对德和约的必要性，并严厉谴责了西德军国主义者的侵略和挑衅政策。
    声明认为，最近在莫斯科举行的华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会会议是社会主义国家在加强和平的斗争中的一个重大的贡献。
    在通过声明之前，捷克斯洛伐克外交部长戴维和国防部长洛姆斯基在会上发了言。
