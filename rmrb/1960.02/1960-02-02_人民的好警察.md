    The People's Good Police
    By our reporters Yuan Guanghou and Li Sufen

    Sending a Child Home Late at Night
    It was after 2 a.m. Chongqing police officer Qiu Dingfa was leading a lost child, turning around in the dark alleys of the shantytown, and finally found the child's home with great difficulty. The child quickly ran into the opened door, hugged the legs of a woman in her thirties, shouted "Mom!" and cried loudly. Instantly, the woman's face filled with tears was replaced by unexpected surprise. She repeatedly said gratefully: "Thank you, thank you! I didn't expect, in the middle of the night...!"

    This happened on the night of December 9th last year. A driver found a lost and crying girl by the roadside and handed her over to Qiu Dingfa, who was on duty in Xiaolongkan. However, the child could only say that her name was Xiao Suying and the names of her grandparents and parents, and knew nothing else.

    Qiu Dingfa called several nearby police stations, but they all said they didn't know whose child it was. He had to call the household registration section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. It was already past 8 p.m., and the comrades in the household registration section checked 50,000 to 60,000 households before finding out that the child's home was in Daping Jiukengzi, more than 20 li away. Qiu Dingfa shouted "Thank you!" in great joy after hearing the phone call, and walked off with the child in his arms. The narrow road had high stone embankments on both sides, and the cold wind was blowing, but he was sweating profusely and felt hungry. Only then did he remember that he had not eaten dinner yet. After finally finding Jiukengzi, there were so many families, and the child couldn't find the direction, how to find it in the middle of the night? Qiu Dingfa had to light his lighter and ask from house to house. After another hour, he finally found the child's home.

    Qiu Dingfa has done more than 1,800 good deeds, big and small, like this in the past year. He also helped car drivers improve the safety facilities of 731 cars, greatly strengthening vehicle management and driving safety.

    Brave Firefighter
    One hot night last year, the 9th squadron of the Chongqing Water Fire Brigade received an emergency fire alarm: a fire broke out at the dressing factory. Deputy Captain Liu Hongquan immediately led all the team members to the scene. At that time, the fire was very fierce. Burning wooden boards were falling down piece by piece, and thick smoke was constantly rolling out. The way to the dressing factory's power distribution room was also blocked. The firefighters were waiting for the commander to issue the order to open the water guns. But Liu Hongquan understood that the order could not be issued without cutting off the power supply, otherwise, the water from the water guns would conduct electricity and cause the comrades to be electrocuted to death.

    "The power must be cut off first!" At this critical moment, Liu Hongquan broke through the fire door and rushed into the power distribution room. The thick smoke filling the entire power distribution room made it difficult for Liu Hongquan to open his eyes, and tears flowed straight down. He groped with difficulty to the power switch, cut off the power, and rushed out of the fire again, with several injuries on his body. But he didn't care about anything, just wanted to put out the fire as soon as possible. He then turned around and climbed onto another roof, directing the battle with all his strength. In about five minutes, the fire was extinguished.

    Another cold winter morning, the river was still very quiet, when suddenly, a sharp whistle sounded, which was a signal for help. Liu Hongquan immediately jumped out of bed, woke up his sleeping partners, and drove the fire boat to the scene of the accident. It turned out that a ferry had an accident and was about to sink. Many passengers were anxiously crowded on the canopy only four or five inches from the water. Liu Hongquan told the driver to drive the ferry at maximum power. After more than a dozen firefighters and crew members from other ships rescued the crowd from the canopy, Liu Hongquan found that there was still light from the electric lights under the water, and thought, there must be someone below! He led several team members, immediately picked up a large axe, jumped onto the canopy of the sinking ferry, and used all their strength to cut a hole in the canopy, took turns to drill in, and rescued five drowned people from the water.

    Liu Hongquan always uses such a high sense of responsibility to protect the lives and property of the country and the people. In the past year or so, he has rescued many people and also rescued materials worth more than 8 million yuan.

    深夜送小孩
    深夜两点多钟了，重庆市民警丘鼎发带着一个迷途的小孩，在漆黑的棚房小巷里转来转去，好容易找到了小孩的家。那小孩飞快地奔进刚被打开的房门，抱住一个三十多岁的妇女的双腿，喊了一声“妈妈！”又大声地哭了起来。顷刻间，这个妇女就以意外的惊喜代替了满面泪容。她连声感激地说道：“谢谢，谢谢！想不到，深更半夜……！”
    这件事发生在去年12月9日的深夜里。一个司机在路旁发现了一个迷路啼哭的女孩，便把她交给在小龙坎值勤的丘鼎发。可是这个小孩只能说出自己名叫萧素英和爷爷妈妈的名字，其他啥也不知道。
    丘鼎发打电话问了附近的好几个派出所，都说不知道是哪家的小孩，他只得摇电话询问市公安局户口科。时间已是晚上八点多了，户口科的同志查了五、六万户，才查出小孩家在离此二十多里的大坪九坑子。丘鼎发听完电话，狂喜地叫一声“谢谢！”抱着小孩就走。狭窄的小路两边是高高的石坎，寒风呼呼吹着，但他却弄得满头大汗，肚子也饿起来了，这时，他才想起自己还没有吃晚饭。好容易找到了九坑子，可是，这样多的人家，小孩又找不着方向，深夜里到哪儿去找？丘鼎发只得将身上的打火机点着，挨家挨户地问。又花了一个多钟头，才把孩子的家找到。
    像这样大大小小的好事，丘鼎发在一年来就办了一千八百多件。他还帮助汽车司机将七百三十一辆汽车改进了安全设施，大大加强了车辆管理和行驶的安全。
    勇敢的消防队员
    去年一个酷热的夜晚，重庆水上消防九中队接到紧急的火警电话：敷料厂发生火灾。副中队长刘洪全马上带领全队队员赶到现场，当时火势很猛，烧着的木板，一块块往下掉，大股大股浓烟不断往外滚。敷料厂配电房的去路也被封住了。消防队员在等待着指挥员发布开水枪的命令。但刘洪全明白，电源没有切断是万万不能发布命令的，否则，水枪的水导电，会使同志们触电死亡。
    “必须先把电源切断！”刘洪全在这千钧一发的时候，突破火门，冲进了配电房。弥漫着整个配电房的滚滚浓烟，熏得刘洪全很难睁开双眼，泪水直淌。他艰难地摸索到了电门开关，切断了电源，再度从烈火中冲出来时，身上已经好几处负伤。但他什么也顾不得了，只想赶快把火扑灭。随着就转身爬上了另一个屋顶，全力指挥战斗。五分钟左右，这场火灾就被扑灭了。
    另一个寒冷的冬晨，江面还很寂静，突然，传来一声尖锐的汽笛声，这是求救的信号。刘洪全立即翻身下床，叫起了熟睡的伙伴，驾着救火艇奔向出事地点。原来有艘渡轮失事，就要沉没了。许多乘客焦急地拥挤在离水面只有四、五寸的顶篷上。刘洪全嘱咐司机用最大的马力驶向渡轮。十多个消防队员和其他船上的船员们，把顶篷上的人群救出来之后，刘洪全发现水底还发出电灯的光亮，心想，底下一定还有人！他带领几个队员，马上提起一把大斧子，跳到快要沉没的渡轮顶篷上，使尽最大的力气，把顶篷砍了个窟窿，轮流钻进去，从水中救上了五个被淹的人。
    刘洪全总是以这样高度的责任感，来保卫国家和人民的生命财产。一年多来，抢救了许多人，还抢救了价值八百多万元的物资。
