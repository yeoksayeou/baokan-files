Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 27th: People's communes in Jiangsu are making every effort to serve spring plowing production, stepping up the manufacture, repair, and improvement of various spring plowing farm tools, and producing large quantities of indigenous pesticides and fertilizers to support agricultural production.

The farm tool factories in Zhenjiang Prefecture's communes put forward the slogan "Do not miss the agricultural season; let farm tools wait for people, not people wait for farm tools." In the past month, in addition to modifying more than 80,000 pieces of water conservancy tools, they have newly manufactured more than 1.2 million pieces of spring plowing production farm tools. The iron and wood factories in Liyang and Wuxi, in order to better support agricultural production, also sent people to production teams to understand what farm tools are needed, how many are needed, when they are needed, and the product specifications. Now, in addition to preparing the tools, pesticides, and fertilizers needed for spring agricultural production, these two places have also produced a batch of sickles, threshers, and rapid harvesters in advance for summer harvesting and planting.

At present, in order to strengthen the forces supporting agricultural production, the people's communes in Jiangsu are simultaneously grasping the production of old factories and developing new factories. Since January, a total of 1,991 newly established commune-run factories have been established throughout the province.

    加紧制造农具  大量生产化肥农药
    江苏社办工业为春耕服务
    据新华社南京27日电　江苏各地人民公社社办工业，全力为春耕生产服务，加紧制造、修理和改良各种春耕农具，大量生产土农药、土化肥，支援农业生产。
    镇江专区各公社农具厂，提出“不误农时季节，叫农具等人，不叫人等农具”的口号，一个多月来，除改制各种水利工具八万多件外，新制春耕生产农具一百二十多万件。溧阳、无锡两地各公社的铁、木工厂，为了更好地支援农业生产，还派人深入生产队，了解要什么农具？要多少？什么时候要？以及产品规格等。现在这两地除准备好春季农业生产需要的工具、农药、化肥外，还提前为夏收夏种生产了一批镰刀、脱粒机、快速收割器。
    现在江苏各地人民公社为了壮大支援农业生产的力量，一手抓老厂生产，一手抓发展新厂的工作，1月份以来全省新办的社办工厂共达一千九百九十一个。
