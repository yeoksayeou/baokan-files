    To increase mulberry leaf production under conditions of deep plowing, fertilization, and pest control in mulberry fields, the central issue is "density." Many old mulberry orchards have sparse mulberry trees, with only two to three hundred plants per mu. Replenishing missing plants should be carried out to increase the density of planting on the ground. However, with only two months left before the spring silkworm rearing season, replanting new mulberry trees will not meet the immediate need. Using mulberry layering (what the masses call "aerial close planting") not only greatly increases production but also ensures that the increased mulberry leaves are available for spring silkworm rearing.

    Combining ground planting with "aerial close planting" can increase the production of a large amount of mulberry leaves and support the raising of a large number of spring silkworms.

    “空中密植”
    在桑地深耕、施肥、治虫等条件下，增产桑叶的中心问题是一个“密”字。各地有很多老桑园，桑树稀稀朗朗，每亩不过二、三百株，应该进行缺株补植工作，增加地上密植程度。但是现在离开春蚕饲养季节只有两个多月，补植新桑树一时还赶不上需要。采用桑树伏条（群众叫做“空中密植”），不但增产效果大，而且增产的桑叶能赶上春蚕饲养的需要。
    把地上密植和“空中密植”结合起来，就能增产大量的桑叶，增养大量的春蚕。
