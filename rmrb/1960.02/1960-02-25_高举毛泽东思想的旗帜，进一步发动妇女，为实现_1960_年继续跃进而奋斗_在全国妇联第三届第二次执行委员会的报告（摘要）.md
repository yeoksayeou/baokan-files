Hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further mobilize women, and strive to achieve a continued leap forward in 1960
    -- Report at the Second Plenary Session of the Third Executive Committee of the All-China Women's Federation (Abstract)
    Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation
    Since 1958, China's women's movement has embarked on a new stage of complete liberation, and even greater achievements were made in 1959
    Under the brilliant illumination of the general line for socialist construction and propelled by the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes, China's women's movement, since 1958, has embarked on a new stage of complete liberation, and even greater achievements were made in 1959; the vast majority of women warmly support the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes. They have become skilled social laborers with a high degree of socialist consciousness and a certain level of cultural and technical expertise. In the campaign to increase production and practice economy, centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, they are full of energy and constantly innovating and creating. Various collective welfare undertakings and social service undertakings, after rectification, development, and construction, have become more consolidated and improved in the countryside; in the cities, they are developing towards universalization, thus further realizing the ideal of socializing housework.

    Why did China's women's movement embark on a new stage of complete liberation in 1958? As everyone knows, the women's liberation movement is a constituent part of the socialist revolution and socialist construction movement. The unequal relations between men and women in the past were actually a reflection of social relations of production, especially class relations. The victorious completion of the socialist revolution eliminated the system of class exploitation, and at the same time eliminated the social roots of women's oppression, achieving women's liberation. However, contradictions between the relations of production and the forces of production, and between the superstructure and the economic base, still exist in socialist society; in the relations of production and the superstructure, there are still traces of the old society and various contradictions within the people. These contradictions will inevitably continue reflecting on the social status of women; only by correctly handling and constantly resolving these contradictions can the complete liberation of women be promoted.

    We can recall that from the founding of the People's Republic of China, through the land reform, although women were allocated land in the same way as men, digging up the economic foundations of the feudal patriarchal system, the traditions of male superiority and female inferiority and the patriarchal system could not be completely destroyed on the basis of the small-scale peasant economy. The agricultural cooperation movement enabled more than half of the women with labor power to participate in social collective labor, basically realizing equal pay for equal work, and the social status of women was further improved. However, small-scale agricultural production cooperatives still restricted the rapid development of productive forces to a certain extent, and the remnants of capitalist ideology and the habits of the petty bourgeoisie were also incompatible with the newly established socialist relations of production. This situation inevitably affected the participation of the vast majority of women in social labor and their social status to a certain extent. It is particularly worth noting that although agricultural production was collectivized after the cooperative movement, the consumption of peasants still retained old traditions and was still based on the family unit, thus creating a contradiction between collective production and individual consumption. This contradiction was first manifested in the women who were responsible for housework, which is the contradiction between social labor and housework. This contradiction restricted the participation of the vast majority of women in social collective labor and seriously affected the women who participated in collective labor.

    In 1958, under the illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes emerged. The rapid development of productive forces promoted the reform of the relations of production (the emergence of the people's communes) and the reform of the superstructure (changes in the spiritual outlook), and this reform of the relations of production and the superstructure in turn promoted the rapid development of productive forces (the Great Leap Forward in the national economy). In such a favorable situation, millions of women went from their homes into factories, and tens of millions of women took to the agricultural production front and other work positions. The widespread and rapid participation of women in social labor required us to quickly resolve the contradiction between collective production and individual consumption, and the new productive forces and relations of production (the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes) provided good conditions for resolving this contradiction. As a result, hundreds of thousands and millions of public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and other collective living welfare undertakings emerged rapidly. Women were liberated from housework and universally participated in social labor. After this kind of collective labor and collective life training, and after years of education by the Party, the spiritual outlook of women has also undergone tremendous changes. In the past, they were confined to the scope of the family, had a narrow vision, and a narrow mind; now they are concerned about national affairs, actively participate in national construction, and their socialist consciousness has been significantly improved. Wherever the Party points, they rush there. All of these mark the beginning of a new stage of complete liberation for the women's movement. Obviously, this is the product of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and it has emerged in response to the new stage of socialist construction and to the new productive forces and relations of production. This significant change in the social status of women makes it possible for them to gradually eliminate the backwardness in politics, ideology, culture, and work ability left over from history in the continued leap forward of the national economy, and to completely complete the cause of women's liberation with the victory of socialism and communism.

    Women's federations should, in accordance with the tasks of developing the national economy put forward by the Party and the state, actively mobilize the masses of women to participate in the mass movement to increase production and practice economy, centered on technical innovation and technical revolution
    The task of developing China's national economy in 1960 is to better implement the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, to better implement the Party’s fundamental policy of developing industry and developing agriculture simultaneously, and to strive for a continued leap forward in national economy on the basis of the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959. Achieving a continued leap forward in 1960 has more favorable political, ideological, material, and technical conditions than in 1958 and 1959, mainly:
    First, the three red banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes have taken root in the hearts of the people. After the anti-Rightist struggle launched within the Party after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, a new upsurge immediately appeared on the economic front and other fronts. After positive practice and negative lessons, all cadres and the broad masses have gained rich experience, have a deeper understanding of the correctness of the general line, and have greater confidence in its implementation.

    Second, under the illumination of the general line, the working people of the whole country have displayed greater enthusiasm and creativity. On the industrial, transportation, finance and trade, and capital construction fronts, the "red opening" at the beginning of the year has appeared, and they are striving for "red every month" and "red all over." On the agricultural front, 70 million people are engaged in large-scale water conservancy construction, and pig raising and fertilizer accumulation are vigorously developed throughout the country. Field management work is better than in the past two years, and farmers across the country are striving for a greater harvest than in 1958 and 1959.

    Third, after rectification, consolidation, and improvement last year, the people's communes have further embarked on a sound development path in terms of production and distribution, and have given greater play to their huge superiority and vigorous vitality. The people love the people's communes and compare them to the "ladder to heaven" for climbing to the communist paradise.

    Fourth, the capital construction in industry, agriculture, transportation, and other fields last year had a greater leap forward than the previous year, and the scale of capital construction this year is even larger than last year. The newly added production capacity will create better material and technical conditions for the sustained leap forward of the national economy this year and in the future.

    Fifth, the strength of industry to support agriculture will greatly exceed any year in the past ten years. This year, the mechanical power in agriculture and the steel used by the state to manufacture agricultural machinery and agricultural tools will be greatly increased, so that the area of mechanized farming and mechanical irrigation and drainage will be rapidly expanded, thereby greatly promoting the technological transformation of agriculture.

    Sixth, the working people of the whole country are engaged in technical innovation and technical revolution in the movement to increase production and practice economy. A mass movement of technological innovation and technical revolution centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation is being vigorously carried out throughout the country in industry, agriculture, transportation, and scientific research. This movement is not only wider than last year, but also more successful and more practical than last year; thereby gradually improving labor productivity and ensuring the over-fulfillment of production and construction plans. With the high tide of the technological revolution, the cultural revolution is rising day by day.

    Of course, we will encounter difficulties and new problems in our continued leap forward; but we have the above-mentioned favorable political, ideological, material, and technical conditions, and the people of the whole country are overcoming difficulties and advancing victoriously with unparalleled confidence.

    Our women's federations should, in accordance with the tasks of developing the national economy put forward by the Party and the state, actively mobilize the masses of women to participate in the mass movement to increase production and practice economy, centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, vigorously run collective living welfare undertakings and social service undertakings, further realize the socialization of housework; strive to guide the masses of women to continuously improve their political and ideological awareness, improve their technical level and cultural level; and make greater contributions to achieving the continued leap forward in 1960 and further consolidating and improving the people's communes.

    In order to do the above work well, I would like to put forward the following three points:
    It is necessary to wholeheartedly and absolutely obey the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Party committees at the same level, so that women's work can keep up with the requirements of the Party, follow closely, follow well, and follow in a timely manner
    First, absolute obedience to the leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in women's work.

    At all levels, women's federations must conduct women's work and play the role of women's federations under the absolute leadership of the Party, resolutely in accordance with the line, principles, and policies formulated by the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and the specific instructions of the Party committees at the same level. The Party is the supreme commander of the Chinese people in carrying out revolution and construction, and the most fundamental thing in putting politics in command is that the Party is in command, that is, Marxism-Leninism is in command, that is, the thought of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution - Mao Zedong Thought - is in command. Over the years, our women's federations at all levels have obeyed the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Party committees at the same level and followed the instructions of the Party to carry out their work; therefore, our work has achieved results. This is the main aspect and the mainstream in our work.

    Our problem is how to keep up with the requirements of the Party, follow closely, follow well, follow in a timely manner, and give fuller play to the role of the women's federation. To achieve this, I think the key issue is to wholeheartedly and absolutely obey the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Party committees at the same level, and to actively and proactively carry out our work. In the past, our women's federation cadres have studied and implemented the Party's lines, principles, and policies; but many cadres have not studied enough and have not understood them deeply, especially because they have not repeatedly studied and discussed them, which has affected the good implementation of our work to varying degrees. In the future, we must correct this shortcoming, seriously study and repeatedly discuss Party documents, carefully read the important editorials in the People's Daily, Red Flag magazine, and other Party publications, and deeply understand the spirit and essence of the Party's line, principles, and important policies, so that we can better implement them in our work, improve the political and ideological nature of our work, improve our leadership work level, and truly do a good job in women's work.

    Our women's federations in various places must also modestly absorb the advanced experiences of women's work from all over the country, and strive to improve their work, and must not be limited to or satisfied with the experience of one place. We must also learn from each other, cooperate vigorously, and jointly mobilize the masses to complete the Party's tasks together with the people's organizations and relevant work units under the leadership of the Party committees at the same level.

    We must also frequently and purposefully go deep into the masses and go deep into reality, resolutely implement the Central Committee's decision on leading cadres going deep into the masses for four months, mingle with the masses in the posture of ordinary laborers, and be familiar with the thoughts and feelings of the masses. Our women's federations have a wide range of contacts with the masses, including women and children under the age of seven, accounting for more than half of the population; therefore, we must strengthen our investigation and research work, understand the ideological trends and requirements of the masses, pay close attention to discovering and cultivating new things among the masses, summarize new experiences, discover new problems, put forward new suggestions, go all out, and work actively.

    At present, women's mass work should continue to focus on production, and take production as the center to grasp life and learning
    Second, what should we focus on in women's mass work at present? According to many years of experience and the current situation, we should continue to focus on production, and take production as the center to grasp life and learning. The purpose of carrying out these tasks is to further mobilize the masses of women, promote the sustained leap forward of socialist construction, continue to improve the socialist and communist consciousness of the masses of women, further consolidate the people's communes, and prepare conditions for accelerating the transition of the people's communes from the basic ownership of the team to the basic ownership of the commune.
    (1) For working women in industrial and agricultural production and in all fronts of socialist construction, we must greatly encourage their enthusiasm and mobilize them to actively participate in the movement to increase production and practice economy, centered on technical innovation and technical revolution.

    We have made great achievements in the historical task of mobilizing women to participate in social labor. Facts have proved that mobilizing large numbers of women to participate in social labor has played a great role in promoting the high-speed construction of socialism; and it has been and is transforming women themselves, greatly changing the social perception of women. Our current task is to further mobilize all women with labor capacity to participate in social labor, and to continuously improve their role in industrial and agricultural production and construction. Chairman Mao told us: "In order to build a great socialist society, it is of great significance to mobilize the broad masses of women to participate in production activities," "The requirement that all women labor power... participate in the labor front should be realized in the shortest possible time." At present, in cities, we must continue to actively and gradually organize family members of employees and resident women to participate in street production, collective living welfare undertakings serving production, and social service undertakings in accordance with the plans and arrangements of the local Party committees; our urban women's federations must put more effort into doing this work well.

    For women working in industrial and agricultural production and in various departments of the national economy, we must continue to greatly encourage their enthusiasm, inspire them to participate in labor more consciously, and advocate the combination of practical work, hard work, and skillful work; at present, we must especially mobilize women to actively participate in the mass movement to increase production and practice economy, centered on technical innovation and technical revolution. At present, the technical level of our country is still very low, and agricultural production is basically manual operation. About 30% of the processes in modern large-scale enterprises are manual operation, and about 70% in street industries; and most of those distributed in manual operation departments are women. Through technical innovation and technical revolution, production efficiency can be increased several times, or even dozens of times, and physical labor can be reduced. Therefore, this is an important key to ensuring the continued leap forward of production, and it is also the urgent requirement of the masses of women.

    Our women's federations must, under the unified leadership of the Party committees at the same level, guide women to further overcome inferiority and conservative thinking, establish great ambitions, liberate their minds, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do, constantly innovate, and constantly create; from nothing to something, from small to large, use foreign methods if possible, use local methods if foreign methods are not possible, and combine local and foreign methods; mainly adopt self-reliance methods, and actively realize the mass movement of technological innovation and technical revolution centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization; and do everything possible to improve labor productivity. Now, various places are actively preparing and promoting the work of agricultural water conservancy, mechanization, and electrification, and our women's federations must actively participate in this work, study and accumulate experience in mobilizing women to participate in the agricultural technical transformation movement; vigorously assist relevant departments in training women to serve as various types of technicians and machinists.

    At the same time, we must pay close attention to protecting women's labor power, and pay attention to their physical health and safety. During women's menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding, we must pay close attention to them, and continue to pay attention to ensuring that women do not do heavy work, do not go into cold water, and do not stay up late during menstruation and pregnancy, and ensure that women have a certain amount of leave before and after childbirth. And we must, according to the situation in various places and various enterprises, improve labor conditions as much as possible and stipulate measures to protect women's labor. We must also combine labor and rest rhythmically, so that there is both work and leisure.

    Further realize the socialization of housework, and transform scattered, trivial, and ignorant housework into a collective socialist economic undertaking
    (2) Vigorously run collective living welfare undertakings and social service undertakings, gradually develop from organizing mainly housework to comprehensively organizing collective life, further realize the socialization of housework, and transform scattered, trivial, and ignorant housework into a collective large-scale socialist economic undertaking.

    Our principle of improving people's lives is now to develop collective living welfare undertakings and increase personal income at the same time, and in the future we will gradually make collective life the main way of life in socialist society. Collective living welfare undertakings and social service undertakings are the inevitable product of the high-speed development of socialist collective production, and are of great significance to promoting the leap forward development of socialist construction, to further consolidating and improving the people's communes, and to enhancing people's collectivist thinking; especially, they greatly help to further liberate women's labor power and create more favorable conditions for women to concentrate on social labor, study politics and culture, and participate in technical innovation and technical revolution. Therefore, running collective living welfare undertakings and social service undertakings is life and also production, and is an indispensable component of the high-speed development of socialist production; they promote each other, rather than opposing each other. The people love these undertakings, and women love them even more.

    In running collective living welfare undertakings and social service undertakings, the current task is to comprehensively arrange people's lives, so we must not only continue to develop and run public canteens well, but also vigorously develop and run breastfeeding rooms, nurseries, kindergartens, service stations, maternity hospitals, and homes for the elderly, greatly improve the quality of service, and strive to expand the scope of service. At the same time, we must actively develop diverse collective welfare and social service undertakings of different scales, forms, and standards, and try our best to meet the different needs of different seasons, different productions, and different people. And continuing to strengthen political and ideological education for women working in collective living welfare and social service undertakings, and vigorously advocating the improvement of tools and technological innovation, are the main measures for running this undertaking well at present. Our women's federations should pay special attention to assisting relevant departments in planning to train childcare workers and educators, actively and gradually develop pediatric nursing schools, develop kindergarten normal schools, train qualified childcare workers and educators, greatly improve the professional level of our breastfeeding rooms, nurseries, and kindergartens, and make children truly receive better education than at home.

    Vigorously mobilize women to actively participate in political study, continuously improve their socialist and communist consciousness, and continuously improve their cultural and scientific level
    (3) Vigorously mobilize women to actively participate in political study and continuously improve their socialist and communist consciousness. Actively participate in literacy and spare-time study and continuously improve their cultural and scientific level.

    People are the most active factor in the productive forces, and giving play to people's enthusiasm and creativity in production is the main key to promoting the high-speed development of production. Political and ideological education and material incentives both have a positive effect on inspiring people's enthusiasm. Our principle is that political and ideological education comes first, and material incentives come second. Chairman Mao told us: "Ideological work and political work are always the soul and commander of all work." Therefore, we must mobilize women to actively participate in political study and continuously guide women to improve their socialist and communist consciousness, and give play to their high degree of consciousness and initiative. It is completely wrong to inappropriately and excessively emphasize personal material interests, which will inevitably encourage bourgeois individualism.

    The main content of current political study is to educate women to more deeply understand and better implement the general line, support the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes, unswervingly take the socialist road, and clarify the great goal of communism. At the same time, it is necessary to educate women to more deeply understand that in order to build socialism at high speed and transition to communism, it is necessary to give full play to the communist spirit of labor, work selflessly, without conditions, and work heroically; individual interests should be subordinate to collective interests, immediate interests should be subordinate to long-term interests, and partial interests should be subordinate to overall interests; continue to implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, running all undertakings diligently and thriftily, and managing households diligently and thriftily, and give play to the fine tradition of hard struggle. To this end, it is necessary to continue to mobilize women to participate in the socialist education movement being carried out in various places, and on this basis, to mobilize the masses of women to study Chairman Mao's works in a planned way.

    Actively helping women continuously improve their cultural and scientific level is of great significance to promoting women's study of political theory, carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, and to narrowing the gap between manual labor and mental labor. And women's illiteracy still accounts for the majority of the current illiterate population. Therefore, our women's federations must put mobilizing and organizing women to study culture and science on a very important work agenda. The Central Committee instructed that the task of eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people should be basically completed in 1962, and we must assist relevant departments in mobilizing and organizing young and middle-aged illiterate women to make unremitting efforts to complete this task ahead of schedule. For women who have already become literate, we must advocate "riding fast without dismounting," and immediately participate in primary, secondary, and even higher spare-time schools, and gradually improve their cultural level and boldly conduct scientific research; and create the necessary conditions for women to participate in learning. We must also encourage women to participate in cultural, recreational, and sports activities to strengthen their physical fitness.

    To do the above three tasks well, women's federations must continue to implement the working method of the mass line and carry out mass movements on a large scale. Carrying out mass movements on a large scale is the most basic method for implementing the Party's general line, and it is also the most important responsibility of our women's federations. We must continue to work hard, in accordance with the Party's line, principles, and policies, boldly mobilize the masses of women to participate in the entire mass movement. According to past experience, focusing on advanced examples, establishing models, and encouraging enthusiasm are effective ways to mobilize women. Since the Great Leap Forward, the red banner hand movement, skillful girl movement, female expert movement, women's experimental fields, high-yield plots, etc., carried out by women's federations at all levels under the absolute leadership and unified arrangement of the Party committees at the same level, have played a extremely significant positive role in inspiring women's enthusiasm, enhancing women's confidence, helping the backward, catching up with the advanced, and thereby more widely and deeply mobilizing the masses of women to participate in the socialist emulation movement of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advance, and helping the backward, and successfully completing the Party's central work tasks, which can be continued to promote.

    Our women's federations must also assist relevant parties to more consciously and systematically boldly promote and train female cadres to participate in leadership work at all levels to strengthen our cadre ranks and more widely mobilize the masses of women.

    In order to do a good job in women's work, women's federation cadres, especially leading cadres, must conscientiously put politics in command, proceed from the overall situation, and develop in an all-round way
    Third, in order to enable the women's federations to do a good job in women's work under the leadership of the Party committees; our women's federation cadres, especially leading cadres, must conscientiously put politics in command, proceed from the overall situation, and develop in an all-round way.

    First of all, we must seriously study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, deeply understand and resolutely implement the Party's line, principles, and policies, and continuously improve our political, ideological, and theoretical level. Over the years, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have achieved great victories in the people's democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, and have opened up a new situation of building socialism at high speed; this is the victory of Marxism-Leninism in China, and it is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is a model of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution and construction, and is Marxism-Leninism developed and enriched based on the experience summary of our country's revolutionary and construction practice. It is the guide of the Chinese revolution and an extremely valuable part of the international treasure of Marxism-Leninism.

    When we study Chairman Mao's works, we must first study Chairman Mao's unwavering proletarian stand, firmly establish the proletarian world view, and transform the bourgeois world view. We must study Chairman Mao's scientific attitude and scientific method of strictly abiding by materialist dialectics, grasp the essence and internal connections of things, deeply understand the Party's line, principles, and policies, and study a series of major issues in our country's revolution and construction. We must study Chairman Mao's thought of combining the theory of continuous revolution with the theory of the stages of revolutionary development, and give full play to the spirit of continuous revolution; and we must especially study his attitude of attaching importance to cultivating and supporting new things. We must better learn Chairman Mao's attitude towards the revolutionary mass movement and the working method of the mass line, firmly rely on the masses of the people, believe that the creativity of the masses of the people is endless, and as long as we rely on the masses of the people under the strong leadership of the Party and carry out mass movements on a large scale, we can be invincible. We leading cadres must especially recognize that only by arming ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought can we better theoretically recognize that the Party's general line for socialist construction is the only correct line during the period of socialist construction in our country, and can we unswervingly implement the Party's line, principles, and policies, and further eliminate the ideological influence of Right opportunism; and only by mastering the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought can we wage a resolute struggle against modern revisionism.

    Secondly, we must not be limited to the small circle of women's work, but must do a good job in women's work and promote the further realization of the cause of women's complete liberation, starting from the completion of the Party's central tasks and from the overall situation of socialist construction. Our women's work cadres must more deeply understand that the cause of women's liberation is part of the Party's socialist revolution and socialist construction, and only with the continuous victory of the socialist revolution and socialist construction can our cause of women's liberation continue to advance. In terms of women's participation in social labor, since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our women's federations at all levels have strived to implement the working policy of focusing on mobilizing women to participate in production; but because our country is still in the period of national economic recovery, the period of socialist transformation, and the early stage of socialist construction, the number of women participating in social labor, although increasing year by year, has increased by a total of two million over the eight years from 1949 to 1957. In 1958, the Party put forward the general line and realized the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement, and in one year alone, the number of female employees increased by more than four million, and almost all women in rural areas who could work participated in various labors of the people's communes. It is very clear that without the great victory of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes; could we have so widely mobilized women to participate in social labor in such a populous country? Therefore, to do a good job in women's work and promote the complete liberation of women, we must strive to implement the general line, realize the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes; we must proceed from the overall situation of socialist construction, correctly recognize that we must start from the completion of the Party's central tasks, actively participate in the central work, and serve the central work; we must not be limited to the small circle of women's work, in order to truly do a good job in women's work. Therefore, our women's work cadres must develop in an all-round way, and often pay attention to the political situation at home and abroad, understand the situation of national economic construction, study and master the Party and the state's principles and policies in politics, economy, culture, education, and other aspects, and care about the trends of the international communist movement and the world peace movement. Widen our horizons, broaden our minds, enlarge our pattern, and develop more politically, so that the political and ideological nature of our work will continue to improve and keep up with the requirements of the Party.

    We must give full play to the spirit of communist cooperation and strive to help and cooperate with all relevant groups and departments; especially, we must often cooperate with people's organizations such as trade unions and the Communist Youth League, and with departments such as finance and trade, education, and health. To do a good job in cooperation, we must first humbly learn from the cooperating party. We must especially humbly learn from trade unions and from the Communist Youth League; and we must also learn from other people's organizations and other work departments led by the Party. Everyone gives play to their respective strengths, grasps their respective characteristics, unites and cooperates to mobilize the masses, and jointly completes the Party's central tasks.

    Female cadres should pay special attention to the special problems of the masses of women, in order to promote the further realization of the cause of women's complete liberation
    I have repeatedly explained the above points, which does not mean that our women's federations do not have their own work. In fact, due to the rapid development of socialist construction, our responsibility for mobilizing the masses of women is significant, and the content of our women's federation work is very rich. At the same time, because the masses of women still have special problems at this stage, our women's federation cadres should of course pay special attention to these problems, often reflect the new situations and problems of the masses of women to the Party committees, put forward suggestions for carrying out women's work, and promote the further realization of the cause of women's complete liberation. If we do not care about women's problems, do not settle down to do women's work, and do not do our own work well, then we have not carried out the commission given to us by the Party and the people, which is completely wrong. We must continue to work hard for a long time and with one breath. I have repeatedly explained that women's federation cadres must study theory, care about politics, proceed from the overall situation, develop in an all-round way, and do a good job in large-scale cooperation; the purpose is to improve the political and ideological nature of women's work, improve the leadership level of our cadres, better implement the Party's line, principles, and policies, truly do a good job in women's work, and do a good job in promoting socialist construction.

    Now we are facing an infinitely beautiful situation. Internationally, the east wind is blowing harder than the west wind, and socialism is getting better day by day, while imperialism is rotting away day by day. Domestically, the sustained leap forward of the national economy is a foregone conclusion. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, the people of our country will certainly build our country into a great socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture within a not too long period of time in the future, and will continue to advance bravely towards the final goal of communism. Our women's cadres will surely train themselves into cadres who understand politics, understand economics, understand culture, and have both scientific theoretical knowledge and practical struggle experience through continuous work and study. Our broad masses of women will surely further improve their economic status through the practice of productive labor, so as to achieve all-round development in politics, ideology, culture, and science and technology, and completely realize the complete liberation of women. I hope that everyone will go all out and strive for the victorious construction of socialism and for the great ideal of communism. (The subheadings are added by the editor)

    我国妇女运动在社会主义建设总路线光辉照耀下，在大跃进和人民公社的推动下，从1958年起，开始走上了实现彻底解放的新阶段，1959年又取得了更加巨大的成就；绝大多数妇女热烈拥护总路线、大跃进和人  民公社。她们已经成为有高度社会主义觉悟，有一定文化技术水平的熟练的社会劳动者。在以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动中，干劲冲天，不断地革新和创造。各种集体福利事业和社会服务事业，经过整顿、发展和建设，在农村已经更加巩固和提高；在城市，正朝着普遍化的方向发展，从而使家务劳动社会化的理想，正在更进一步地实现。
    为什么我国的妇女运动在1958年开始走上彻底解放的新阶段呢？大家都知道，妇女解放运动是社会主义革命和社会主义建设运动的一个构成部分。过去历史上男女不平等的关系，实际上是社会生产关系，特别是阶级关系的反映。社会主义革命的胜利完成，消灭了阶级剥削制度，同时就消灭了妇女受压迫的社会根源，实现了妇女解放。但是，社会主义社会仍然存在着生产关系和生产力的矛盾，上层建筑和经济基础的矛盾；在生产关系和上层建筑中，还存在着旧社会残留的痕迹，存在着人民内部的各种矛盾，这些矛盾必然仍将反映到妇女所处的社会地位方面来；只有正确处理和不断解决这些矛盾，才能促进妇女的彻底解放。
    我们可以回想一下，从中华人民共和国成立时起，经过土地改革，妇女们虽然同男子一样分得了土地，挖掉了封建家长制度的经济基础；但是在小农经济的基础上，男尊女卑的传统和家长制度决不可能彻底摧毁。农业的合作化使半数以上有劳动力的妇女参加了社会集体劳动，基本实现了同工同酬，妇女们的社会地位是进一步提高了。但是规模不大的农业生产合作社，仍然在一定程度上限制生产力的飞跃发展，资本主义思想的残余和小资产阶级的习惯势力也同新建立的社会主义生产关系不相适应。这种情况，使广大妇女参加社会劳动和她们在社会上的地位不能不受到一定的影响。特别值得注意的是合作化后虽然使农业生产集体化了，但农民的消费还保留着旧的传统，仍然以家庭为单位，这样就产生集体生产和个体消费间的矛盾，这种矛盾首先表现在担负家务劳动的妇女身上，这就是社会劳动和家务劳动间的矛盾；这种矛盾限制了广大妇女参加社会集体劳动，并且使参加集体劳动的妇女也受到了严重影响。
    1958年在党的社会主义建设总路线照耀下，出现了大跃进和人民公社。生产力的飞跃发展，促进了生产关系的改革（人民公社的出现）和上层建筑的改革（精神面貌的变化），而这种生产关系和上层建筑的改革，又反过来促进生产力的飞跃发展（国民经济的大跃进）。在这样的大好形势下，几百万妇女从家庭中走进了工厂，几千万妇女走上了农业生产战线和其它工作岗位。广大妇女迅速地普遍地参加了社会劳动，要求我们迅速解决集体生产和个体消费间的矛盾，而新的生产力和生产关系（大跃进和人民公社）又为解决这个矛盾提供了良好的条件；于是几十万、几百万个公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等集体生活福利事业就迅速地涌现出来了。妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，普遍参加了社会劳动。经过这种集体劳动和集体生活的锻炼，经过党多年的教育，妇女精神面貌也发生巨大的变化。过去她们局限在家庭范围内，眼界不广，胸怀狭窄；现在她们关心国家大事，积极参加国家建设，社会主义觉悟显著地提高了，党指向那里，就奔向那里。所有这些，都标志着妇女运动开始进入彻底解放的新阶段。显然，这是总路线、大跃进和人民公社的产物，是适应着社会主义建设的新阶段，适应着新的生产力和生产关系而出现的。妇女社会地位的这一个显著的变化，使她们有可能在国民经济的继续跃进中，逐步消灭历史上遗留给妇女的在政治上、思想上、文化上、工作能力上的落后状态，随着社会主义、共产主义的胜利，而彻底完成妇女的解放事业。
      妇联组织应当根据党和国家提出的发展国民经济的任务，积极发动妇女群众参加以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约的群众运动
    1960年我国发展国民经济的任务，是更好地执行党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，更好地贯彻执行党的发展工业和发展农业同时并举的根本方针，在1958年和1959年连续大跃进的基础上，争取国民经济的继续跃进。1960年实现继续跃进，具有比1958年和1959年更加有利的政治、思想和物质、技术条件，主要的是：
    第一、总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗已经深入人心。经过党的八届八中全会以后在党内开展了反右倾的斗争，在经济战线和其它战线上立即出现一个新的高潮。全体干部和广大群众经过正面的实践和反面的教训，取得了丰富的经验，对总路线的正确性，体会更深，贯彻执行的信心更高。
    第二、在总路线照耀下，全国劳动人民发挥了更大的积极性和创造性。在工业、交通、财贸、基本建设战线上，出现了年初的“开门红”，正在争取“月月红”和“满堂红”。在农业战线上，七千万人大搞水利建设，全国各地大力发展养猪积肥，田间管理工作比过去两年做得更好，全国农民正在力争比1958年和1959年取得更大的丰收。
    第三、人民公社经过去年整顿、巩固和提高，在生产、分配等方面，进一步走上了健全发展的道路，更加发挥出巨大的优越性和旺盛的生命力。人民群众热爱人民公社，把它比作攀登共产主义天堂的“上天梯”。
    第四、去年工业、农业、交通运输业等方面的基本建设比前年有更大的跃进，今年基本建设的规模比去年更大，新增的生产能力，将为今年和今后国民经济的持续跃进创造更好的物质、技术条件。
    第五、工业支援农业的力量将大大超过以往十年中的任何一年。今年农业方面的机械动力，国家用于制造农业机械和农业工具的钢材，均将大大增加，使机耕面积和机械排灌面积将迅速扩大，从而可以使农业技术改造大大推进一步。
    第六、全国劳动人民在增产节约运动中大闹技术革新和技术革命，不论在工业、农业、交通运输和科学研究等方面，一个以机械化、半机械化和自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，正在全国范围内轰轰烈烈地开展起来，这一个运动不但比去年更广泛，而且比去年更成功，更踏实；从而将逐步提高劳动生产率，保证生产和建设计划的超额完成。随着技术革命的高潮，文化革命正在日益高涨。
    当然在我们继续跃进中，还会遇到困难，还会发生新的问题；但是我们已经具备了上述政治、思想和物质、技术上的有利条件，全国人民正以无比的信心，克服困难，乘胜前进。
    我们妇联组织应当根据党和国家提出的发展国民经济的任务，积极发动妇女群众参加以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约的群众运动，大力办好集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业，进一步实现家务劳动社会化；努力引导妇女群众不断提高政治、思想觉悟，提高技术水平和文化水平；为实现1960年的继续跃进，为进一步巩固和提高人民公社作出更大的贡献。
    为作好以上工作，我提出下面三点意见：
    要全心全意绝对服从党中央及同级党委的领导，使妇女工作跟上党的要求，跟得紧，跟得好，跟得及时
    第一、绝对服从党的领导，是做好妇女工作的根本保证。
    各级妇联组织必须在党的绝对领导下，坚决本着以毛泽东同志为首的党中央制定的路线、方针、政策和同级党委的各项具体指示，进行妇女工作，发挥妇联组织的作用。党是中国人民进行革命和建设的最高统帅，政治挂帅最根本的就是党来挂帅，就是马克思列宁主义挂帅，就是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命实践相结合的思想——毛泽东思想挂帅。多年来，我们各级妇联组织是服从党中央和同级党委领导，遵循着党的指示进行工作的；因而我们的工作是有成绩的。这是主要的一方面，是工作中的主流。
    我们的问题是如何跟上党的要求，跟得紧，跟得好，跟得及时，更充分发挥妇联组织作用的问题。要做到这一点，我认为关键问题在于全心全意绝对服从党中央及同级党委的领导，主动地积极地进行工作。我们妇联干部过去是学习和执行了党的路线、方针和政策的；但也有不少干部学习不够，领会不深，特别是反复研究讨论不够，因此不同程度地影响了在我们工作中很好地贯彻执行。今后我们必须改正这个缺点，认真学习和反复讨论党的文件，仔细阅读人民日报、红旗杂志及其他党刊上的重要社论，深刻领会党的路线、方针及重要政策的精神实质，从而才能在我们工作中很好地贯彻执行，提高我们工作的政治性、思想性，提高我们的领导工作水平，真正做好妇女工作。
    我们各地妇联还必须虚心吸取全国各地妇女工作的先进经验，努力提高工作，改进工作，不能局限或满足于一个地方的经验。对于同级党委领导下的各人民团体及各有关工作单位，也要相互学习，大力协作，共同发动群众，协力完成党的任务。
    我们还必须经常地、有目的地深入群众、深入实际，坚决贯彻执行中央关于领导干部深入群众四个月的决定，以普通劳动者的姿态，和群众打成一片，熟悉群众的思想感情。我们妇联组织联系群众的面很宽，有妇女、有七岁以下的儿童，占人口半数以上；所以我们一定要加强调查研究工作，了解群众的思想动态和要求，密切注意发现和培养群众中的新生事物，总结新的经验，发现新的问题，提出新的建议，鼓足干劲，积极工作。
    当前妇女群众工作仍应继续抓生产，并以生产为中心抓生活和学习
    第二、当前在妇女群众工作方面抓什么？根据多年
  的经验和当前的情况，仍应继续抓生产，并以生产为中心抓生活和学习。进行这些工作的目的，是更进一步发动妇女群众，推进社会主义建设持久的跃进，继续提高妇
  女群众的社会主义、共产主义觉悟，进一步巩固人民公
  社，并为加速人民公社由队的基本所有制过渡到社的基本所有制准备条件。
      （1）对在工农业生产和建设社会主义各个战线上
  的劳动妇女，要大鼓干劲，发动她们积极参加以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动。
    对于发动妇女参加社会劳动的历史任务，我们已经
  作出了伟大的成绩。事实证明，发动大批妇女参加社会劳动，对促进高速度建设社会主义起了极大的作用；而且已经并正在改造妇女们自己，大大改变了社会上对妇女的观感。当前我们的任务是更进一步发动所有有劳动能力的妇女参加社会劳动，并不断地提高她们在工农业生产和建设中的作用。毛主席告诉我们：“为了建设伟大的社会主义社会，发动广大的妇女群众参加生产活动，具有极大的意义”，“使全部妇女劳动力……一律参加到劳动战线上去，这个要求，应当在尽可能短的时间内，予以实现”。当前我们在城市要继续根据当地党委的计划安排，积极而又逐步地组织职工家属和居民妇女参加街道生产，参加为生产服务的集体生活福利事业及社会服务事业；我们城市妇联必须用更大的力量做好这项工作。
    对在工农业生产和国民经济各部门劳动的妇女，要继续大鼓干劲，启发她们更自觉地参加劳动，提倡实干、苦干、巧干相结合；当前特别要发动妇女积极参加以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约的群众运动。目前我国的技术水平还很低，农业生产基本上是手工操作。用手工操作的工序近代化大企业中约有30％左右，街道工业中约有70％左右；而且分布在手工操作部门的大部分是妇女。经过技术革新和技术革命，能使生产效率提高几倍，甚至几十倍，并且可以减轻体力劳动。所以这是保证生产继续跃进的重要关键，也是妇女群众的迫切要求。
    我们妇联组织要在同级党委统一领导下，引导妇女更进一步克服自卑保守思想，树雄心，立大志，解放思想，敢想敢说敢做，不断革新，不断创造；由无到有，由小到大，能洋则洋，不能洋则土，土洋并举；主要采取自力更生办法，积极实现机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动；千方百计地提高劳动生产率。现在各地正在积极准备和推行农业水利化、机械化、电气化的工作，我们妇联必须积极参加这项工作，研究和积累发动妇女参加农业技术改造运动的经验；大力协助有关部门培养训练妇女担任各种各样技术人员和机械手。
    与此同时，我们必须密切注意保护妇女劳动力，注意她们的身体的健康和安全。在妇女月经、怀孕、生孩子、奶孩子的时期，我们一定要密切关心，继续注意使妇女在经期、孕期不作重活，不下冷水，不熬夜，保证妇女在产前、产后有一定时间的休假。并要根据各地的情况，各个企业的情况，尽可能地改善劳动条件，规定保护妇女劳动的措施。还要把劳动和休息有节奏地结合起来，做到有劳有逸。
      更进一步实现家务劳动社会化，把分散的、繁琐的、使人愚昧的家务劳动改造为集体的社会主义经济事业
      （2）大力办好集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业，逐步由组织主要家务劳动向全面组织集体生活发展，更进一步实现家务劳动社会化，把分散的、繁琐的、使人愚昧的家务劳动改造为集体的大规模的社会主义经济事业。
    我们提高人民生活的原则，现在是发展集体生活福利事业和增加个人收入同时进行，今后将逐步使集体生活成为社会主义社会的主要生活方式。集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业，是高速度发展社会主义集体生产必然的产物，对促进社会主义建设飞跃发展，对进一步巩固提高人民公社，对增进人们的集体主义思想有极大的意义；特别是大大有助于更进一步解放妇女劳动力，为妇女专心一意从事社会劳动、学习政治、文化、参加技术革新和技术革命创造更有利的条件。因此办集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业，是生活，也是生产，是高速度发展社会主义生产中的一个不可缺少的构成部分；是相互促进，而不是相互对立的。人民群众喜爱这些事业，妇女群众更加热爱它。
    在办好集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业方面，当前要全面安排好人民生活，因此我们既要继续发展和办好公共食堂，又要大力发展和办好哺乳室、托儿所、幼儿园、服务站、妇产院和敬老院等等，大大提高服务质量，努力扩大服务范围。与此同时，要积极发展多种多样的规模不同，形式、标准不一的集体福利和社会服务事业，尽量满足不同季节、不同生产、不同人民群众的不同需要。而继续对在集体生活福利和社会服务事业中工作的妇女，加强政治思想教育，大力提倡改良工具，革新技术，是当前办好这项事业的主要措施。我们妇联特别要注意协助有关部门有计划地培养保育员和教养员，积极而又逐步地发展小儿科护士学校，发展幼稚师范学校，培养合格的保育员和教养员，大大提高我们哺乳室、托儿所、幼儿园的业务水平，使儿童真正得到比在家里更好的教养。
    大力发动妇女，积极参加政治学习，不断提高社会主义和共产主义觉悟，不断提高文化科学水平
      （3）大力发动妇女，积极参加政治学习，不断提高社会主义、共产主义觉悟。积极参加扫盲和业余学习，不断提高文化、科学水平。
    人是生产力中最活跃的因素，发挥人在生产中的积极性和创造性，是促进生产高速度发展的主要关键。政治思想教育和物质鼓励，对于鼓舞人民干劲，都有积极作用。我们的原则是政治思想教育第一，物质鼓励第二。毛主席告诉我们：“思想工作和政治工作永远是一切工作的灵魂和统帅”。因此，我们必须发动妇女积极参加政治学习，不断地引导妇女提高社会主义、共产主义觉悟，发挥妇女高度的自觉性和积极性。不适当地过分强调个人物质利益，必将助长资产阶级个人主义思想，是完全错误的。
    当前政治学习的主要内容，是要教育妇女更深刻地认识和更好地贯彻执行总路线、拥护大跃进和人民公社，坚定不移地走社会主义道路，明确共产主义的伟大目标。同时要教育妇女更深刻地认识要高速度建设社会主义，并向共产主义过渡，必须充分发挥共产主义的劳动精神，不计报酬，不讲条件，英勇劳动；个人利益服从集体利益，眼前利益服从长远利益，局部利益服从整体利益；继续执行勤俭建国，勤俭办一切事业，勤俭持家的方针，发挥艰苦奋斗的优良传统。为此要继续发动妇女参加各地正在开展的社会主义教育运动，并在这基础上有计划地发动妇女群众学习毛主席的著作。
    积极帮助妇女不断提高文化、科学水平，对于促进妇女学习政治理论，进行技术革新和技术革命，以及对于缩小体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别，都有极重大的意义。而妇女文盲在当前现有文盲中还是占多数。因此，我们妇联必须把发动和组织妇女学习文化、科学放在十分重要的工作日程上。中央指示在1962年要基本完成扫除青壮年文盲的任务，我们要协助有关部门发动和组织青壮年妇女文盲，为提前完成这任务而不懈地努力。对于已经脱盲的妇女，要提倡“快马加鞭不下鞍”，紧接着参加初等、中等以至高等业余学校，步步提高文化水平，大胆进行科学研究；并为妇女参加学习创造必要的条件。我们还要提倡妇女参加文娱、体育活动，增强妇女体质。
    要做好以上三项工作，妇联组织必须继续执行群众路线的工作方法，大搞群众运动。大搞群众运动，是贯彻执行党的总路线的最基本的方法，也是我们妇联组织的最主要的职责。必须继续努力，根据党的路线、方针、政策，放手发动妇女群众，参加整个群众运动。根据过去的经验，大抓先进，大立标兵，大鼓干劲，是发动妇女的一个有效的办法。大跃进以来，各地妇联在同级党委绝对领导和统一安排之下，开展的红旗手运动、巧姑娘运动、女能手运动、妇女试验田、丰产方等等，对于鼓舞妇女干劲，增强妇女信心，帮助后进，赶上先进，从而更广泛深入地发动妇女群众参加比先进、学先进、赶先进、帮后进的社会主义竞赛运动，胜利完成党的中心工作任务方面，起了极为显著的积极作用，可以继续推行。
    我们妇联还必须协助有关方面，更有计划更有意识地大胆提拔和培养女干部，参加各级领导工作以壮大我们的干部队伍，更广泛地发动妇女群众。
    为了做好妇女工作，妇联干部，特别是领导干部，必须要认真做到政治挂帅，从全局出发，向全面发展
    第三、为着使妇联组织能够在党委领导下，做好妇女工作；我们妇联干部、特别是领导干部，必须要认真做到政治挂帅，从全局出发，向全面发展。
    首先必须认真学习马克思列宁主义、毛主席的著作，深刻领会和坚决贯彻执行党的路线、方针和政策，不断地提高政治、思想、理论水平。多年来，我国人民在党和毛主席的英明领导下，取得了人民民主革命和社会主义革命的伟大胜利，开创了高速度建设社会主义的新局面；这是马克思列宁主义在中国的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。毛泽东思想是马列主义的普遍真理和中国革命、建设的具体实践相结合的典范，是依据我国革命和建设实践的经验总结，发展和丰富了的马克思列宁主义，是中国革命的指南，是国际马克思列宁主义宝库中极为珍贵的一部分。
    我们学习毛主席的著作，必须首先学习毛主席坚定不移的无产阶级立场，巩固地树立无产阶级的世界观，改造资产阶级的世界观。我们要学习毛主席严格遵守唯物论辩证法的科学态度和科学方法，抓住事物的本质和
  内在联系，深刻领会党的路线、方针和政策，研究我国革命和建设中一系列的重大问题。我们要学习毛主席不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相结合的思想，充分发挥不断革命的精神；还特别要学习他重视培养和扶持新生事物的态度。我们要更好地学习毛主席对待革命群众运动的态度和群众路线的工作方法，坚定地依靠人民群众，相信人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，只要在党的坚强领导下，依靠人民群众，大搞群众运动，我们就可以无往而不胜利。我们做领导工作的干部，特别要认识只有用毛泽东思想武装起来，才能更好地从理论上认识党的社会主义建设总路线，是我国社会主义建设时期唯一正确的路线，才能坚定不移地贯彻执行党的路线、方针、政策，更进一步清除右倾机会主义的思想影响；也只有掌握毛泽东思想武器，才能和现代修正主义进行坚决的斗争。
    其次，我们不要局限在妇女工作小圈子里，要从完成党的中心任务出发，从社会主义建设的全局出发，做好妇女工作，促进妇女彻底解放事业进一步的实现。我们妇女工作干部必须更深刻地认识，妇女解放事业是党的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的一部分，只有社会主义革命和社会主义建设的不断胜利，我们妇女解放事业才能不断前进。就妇女参加社会劳动的情况来说，从中华人民共和国成立以来，我们各级妇联就努力执行以发动妇女参加生产为中心的工作方针；但是由于当前我们国家还处在国民经济恢复时期，社会主义改造时期，社会主义建设的初期，妇女参加社会劳动的人数，虽然逐年增加，从1949年到1957年，八年间增加的女职工，总共有二百几十万人。而1958年党提出了总路线，实现了大跃进和人民公社化运动，一年之内，女职工就增加了四百多万人，农村所有能劳动的妇女几乎都参加了人民公社的各项劳动。事情很明白，没有总路线、大跃进、人民公社的伟大胜利；我们能够在这样人口众多的大国里，这样普遍地发动妇女参加社会劳动吗？所以我们要做好妇女工作，促进妇女彻底解放，必须努力贯彻执行总路线，实现大跃进和人民公社；必须从社会主义建设的全局出发，正确认识从完成党的中心工作任务出发，积极参加中心工作，为中心工作服务；不要局限在妇女工作的小圈子里，才能真正做好妇女工作。因此，我们妇女工作干部，必须向全面发展，经常注意国内外政治形势，了解国家经济建设的情况，学习和掌握党和国家在政治、经济、文化、教育等各方面的方针、政策，关心国际共产主义运动和世界和平运动的动向。把眼光放远一些，胸襟放宽一些，局面放大一些，政治上更加开展一些，那么我们工作的政治性、思想性就会不断提高，跟上党的要求。
    我们更要充分发挥共产主义大协作的精神，努力与一切有关团体、部门互助协作；特别要与工会、共青团等人民团体，与财贸、教育、卫生等部门经常协作。要搞好协作，必须首先向协作的对方虚心学习。我们特别要虚心地向工会学习，向共青团学习；还要向党领导的其他人民团体和其他工作部门学习。大家发挥各自的长处，抓住各自的特点，同心协力发动群众，共同完成党的中心任务。
    妇女干部应该特别关心妇女群众的特殊问题，以促进妇女彻底解放事业的进一步实现
    我反复说明以上几点，并不是意味着我们妇联没有自己的工作。事实上由于社会主义建设的飞跃发展，我们发动妇女群众的责任是重大的，我们妇联的工作内容是非常丰富的。同时由于妇女群众在现阶段还有特殊的问题，我们妇联干部当然应该特别关心这些问题，经常向党委反映妇女群众的新的情况和问题，提出开展妇女工作的建议，促进妇女彻底解放事业的进一步实现。如果我们不关心妇女问题，不安心妇女工作，不做好自己的工作，那就没有执行党和人民给我们的委托，是完全不对的。我们必须长期干下去，一股劲儿干下去。我反复说明妇联干部要学习理论，关心政治，从全局出发，向全面发展，搞好大协作；其目的都为了提高妇女工作的政治性、思想性，提高我们干部的领导水平，更好地贯彻执行党的路线、方针、政策，真正做好妇女工作，做好建设社会主义的促进派。
    现在我们正面临着无限美好的形势，在国际上，东风劲吹西风衰，社会主义一天天好起来，帝国主义一天天烂下去。在国内，国民经济的持续跃进已成定局。我们深信，在以毛主席为首的党中央领导下，我国人民一定能够在今后一个不太长的时期内，把我国建设成为一个有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义强国，并在以后继续向着共产主义的最后目标奋勇前进。我们妇女干部必将通过不断地工作和学习，使自己锻炼成为懂得政治、懂得经济、懂得文化，既有科学理论知识，又有实际斗争经验的全面发展的干部。我们广大妇女群众必将通过生产劳动的实践，更进一步提高自己的经济地位，从而在政治上、思想上、文化上、科学技术上达到全面发展，完全实现妇女的彻底解放。希望大家鼓足更大干劲，为胜利建设社会主义、并为共产主义的伟大理想而努力奋斗。　（小插题是编者加的）
