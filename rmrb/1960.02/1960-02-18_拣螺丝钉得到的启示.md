    Enlightenment from Picking Up Screws

    At the end of last year, two comrades and I went to work at the Yabulai Salt Field in Alxa League, Inner Mongolia. One evening after dinner, we were walking on the highway from Yabulai to Hexibao in Gansu, and we inadvertently picked up a screw. We felt it would be a pity to leave it, so we put it in our pocket.

    Because we picked up the first screw, we had an idea: why not search as we walked? So we picked up a second, a third… one after another. As a result, we picked up quite a few screws in a one-kilometer stretch of road near the salt field, as well as washers, iron pieces, and iron wire. Where did these things come from? We guessed they probably fell off cars due to bumps and vibrations during driving.

    We originally did this without much thought, but after reflecting on it, it gave us great inspiration. We did some calculations: in less than a month, we picked up over three pounds of screws and scrap iron in a one-kilometer stretch of road. If we extrapolate this to the whole country, who knows how much we could pick up? Of course, not every kilometer of road will have that much at every period. But it illustrates a truth: many a little makes a mickle. This truth is especially applicable to a country like ours with a vast territory and a large population.

    In the past, under the Party's guidance, we understood the principle of increasing production and practicing economy, but when we saw small things and small matters, we always thought they were too small and insignificant, so we didn't economize when we should have, we didn't collect what we should have, and we wasted what we shouldn't have. From the small matter of picking up screws, I got this enlightenment: the Party's policy of increasing production and practicing economy is absolutely correct. In responding to the Party's call, practicing economy and increasing production means not only setting our sights high and grabbing watermelons, but also starting with small things and picking up sesame seeds. Those who pick up sesame seeds should not dislike them for being small and few, and those who drop sesame seeds should not think the problem is too small to pay attention to. If we all start with small things and leave nothing out, we can gather drips and dewdrops into the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, flowing into the ocean of socialism.

### 拣螺丝钉得到的启示

    拣螺丝钉得到的启示
    去年年底，我和两个同志到内蒙古阿拉善旗雅布赖盐场去工作。一次晚饭后，我们在从雅布赖到甘肃河西堡的公路上散步，无意中拾到了一个螺丝钉；觉得丢下可惜，就装进口袋里。
    由于拾得了第一个螺丝钉，我们灵机一动，倡议一面散步，一面搜索，于是第二个、第三个……接二连三地拣起来了。结果在距离盐场一公里长的地段内拾到了不少螺丝钉；另外还有垫圈、铁片、铁丝等。以后，我们又在那个地段内先后拾了四次，总共拾了三斤多螺丝钉和废铁。这些东西是从哪里来的呢？我们推测，很可能是汽车在行驶中因颠簸震荡而掉落的。
    这件事我们原出无心，然而事后深思，给我们极大启发。我们算了一下账：在不到一个月的时间里，在一公里长的地段内，就拾了螺丝钉和废铁三斤，如果推及全国，就不知能拾多少了。当然，未必每一公里路每一时期都有那么多的东西。但是它说明了一个真理：集腋可以成裘。这个真理，尤其适用于像我们这样一个幅员广大、人口众多的国家。
    过去，我们在党的教导下，也明白增产节约的道理，但是看见小东西小事情，总认为太小太少，没有什么了不起，因此该节约的没有节约，该收集的没有收集，不该浪费的反而浪费了。从我们拾螺丝钉的小事情中，我得到这样一个启示：党的增产节约方针万分正确，我们响应党的号召，厉行增产节约，不但要从大处着眼抱西瓜，而且要从小处着手拣芝麻。拣芝麻的人不应嫌小嫌少，而掉芝麻的人更不应认为问题小而不注意。如果我们都从小处着手，丝毫不漏，那就会使滴水滴露聚为长江大河，流入社会主义的海洋。
