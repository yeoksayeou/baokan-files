    Leaders Must Have Foresight
    Wu Lü
    The news about Shanghai Liming Printing and Dyeing Factory's vigorous efforts to save coal not only provides us with some experiences in saving coal and the experience of leaders in saving coal but also gives people a very important inspiration. That is, leaders must have foresight.
    A leader's foresight is an important prerequisite for any work to move from one victory to another. Saving coal is originally a regular task, but in the vigorously developing technical innovation and technical revolution movement, it is entirely foreseeable that with the comprehensive and continued leap forward in production, the need for fuel will inevitably increase significantly. Taking action early and vigorously grasping coal saving is one of the measures to prepare for a rainy day. With such foresight, timely measures can be taken to be in a relatively active position. Without this foresight, waiting until fuel difficulties arise and "digging a well when thirsty" would lead to a passive situation. The Party organization of Shanghai Liming Printing and Dyeing Factory, due to foreseeing the needs of production development, grasped the ideological work of saving coal at the beginning of the year and took measures, thus making great achievements.
    Is it very difficult to learn to foresee the development of things? It seems to be very difficult. However, if one learns the method of scientific analysis and analyzes specific things realistically and concretely, it is not difficult to discover the development trend of things, and thus have foresight.
    The method of scientific analysis is dialectical materialism. For leaders to have foresight, the most important thing is to learn to use dialectical materialism to observe the contradictory movement of things. By understanding the contradictory movement of the objective world, one can recognize the inevitable trend of the development of things. Chairman Mao has repeatedly said that it is necessary to seek truth from facts, to discover laws from objective things, to foresee the development trend of things, and "to promote the transformation of things to achieve the purpose of the revolution." ("On Contradiction") That is, to foresee new problems in work and to be a promoter. Some comrades who are engaged in leadership work lack foresight because they often lack a developmental perspective on problems, so they often cannot see the next step when taking this step, have a short-sighted vision, and stop after a little success. They also often lack an understanding of the movement of contradictions, so when work is relatively smooth, they feel that there are no problems, forming blind optimism, and relaxing their efforts. It can be seen that for leaders to have foresight, the most important thing is to study dialectical materialism. Moreover, by going deep into the masses, going deep into reality, grasping the objective laws of the contradictory movement of things, and repeatedly understanding contradictions, one can foresee the process of things, continuously solve contradictions, and be a good promoter.
    Now, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is truly advancing rapidly, making great strides forward. Because the movement is progressing rapidly, new problems will inevitably emerge in large numbers, requiring foreseeable and early solutions. Saving coal is just one example. After a production link is improved through technical innovation, other links need to catch up quickly, which is the issue of serialization; as the production of the entire enterprise advances by leaps and bounds, more raw materials, materials, and fuel are needed, which is the issue of increasing production and saving raw materials, materials, and fuel; as productivity develops, labor organization needs to be further adjusted, rules and regulations need to be further revised, the relationship between people needs to be further coordinated, and the mental outlook of the people needs to be further improved, these are all issues of adjusting the relations of production and the superstructure. Comrades engaged in leadership work must foresee the occurrence of these new problems and solve them in a timely manner. In this way, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement can continue to develop.

    领导要有预见
    吴滤
    上海丽明印染厂大抓节约用煤的新闻，不仅给我们提供了一些节约用煤的经验和一些领导节约用煤工作的经验，而且还给人们提供了一个很重要的启发。这就是，领导者一定要有预见。
    领导的预见，是任何工作从一个胜利走向另一个胜利的重要前提。节约用煤本来是一项经常工作，但是在蓬勃发展的技术革新和技术革命运动中，完全可以预见到随着生产的全面继续跃进，燃料的需要必然大量增长，如果及早动手，大抓节约用煤，就是未雨绸缪的措施之一。有了这样的预见，及时采取了措施，就能处于比较主动的地位。如果没有这种预见，待到燃料发生困难而“临渴掘井”，那就会陷于被动了。上海丽明印染厂党组织由于预见到生产发展的需要，在年初就抓紧了节约用煤的思想工作，并采取了措施，因而作出了很大成绩。
    学会预见到事物的发展，是不是很困难的呢？看来，似乎是很困难的。但是，如果学会了科学分析的方法，实事求是地对具体事物进行具体分析，那就不难发现事物的发展趋势，也就有了预见。
    科学分析的方法，就是唯物辩证法。领导者要有预见，最重要的就是学会用唯物辩证法去观察事物的矛盾运动。认识了客观世界的矛盾运动，就能认识到事物发展的必然趋势。毛主席一再说过，要实事求是，要从客观事物中去发现规律，预见事物的发展趋势，“促成事物的转化，达到革命的目的。”（“矛盾论”）也即是要在工作中预见新的问题，当促进派。有些做领导工作的同志所以缺乏预见，往往是缺乏从发展观点来看待问题，因而常常是走这一步的时候，看不到下一步，目光不远，浅尝辄止。也往往是缺乏对矛盾运动的认识，因而在工作比较顺利的时候，就觉得没有什么问题了，形成盲目乐观，麻痹松劲。可见，领导要有预见，最重要的一条是学习唯物辩证法。并且，深入群众，深入实际，掌握事物矛盾运动的客观规律，反复地认识矛盾，才能预见事物的进程，不断解决矛盾，当好一个促进派。
    现在，技术革新和技术革命运动真是势如破竹，一日千里。因为运动进展迅速，新的问题必然会大量出现，需要有预见地及早动手解决。节约用煤，不过是其中的一例。一个生产环节经过技术革新，提高了效率，其他的环节就需要迅速地跟上去，这就是系列化的问题；整个企业的生产大踏步地前进了，需要更多的原料、材料、燃料，这是原料、材料、燃料的增产和节约的问题；生产力发展了，劳动组织需要作进一步的调整，规章制度需要作进一步的修订，人与人之间的关系需要有进一步的协调，人们的精神面貌需要有进一步的提高，这些都是调整生产关系和上层建筑的问题。做领导工作的同志，一定要预见到这些新的问题的发生，及时地去解决。这样，技术革新和技术革命运动才能不断地发展。
