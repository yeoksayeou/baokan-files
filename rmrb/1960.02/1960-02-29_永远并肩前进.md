    Always Advancing Shoulder to Shoulder
    By Our Correspondent Li Zhengjie
      Not a Single Flaw to Pick Out
    February is the season when the sun is warm and the spring is burgeoning. The wheat fields of Qizhou People's Commune in Anguo County have already turned green, a verdant sight. The land prepared for the autumn harvest emits wisps of steam, carrying a fragrant, earthy scent. People are busily at work, some irrigating the wheat fields with trickles of water drawn from mechanical wells; others are shouting at livestock and cracking whips, as hundreds of rubber-wheeled carts carrying fertilizer shuttle back and forth across the fields… The fields are a scene of busy spring preparations.
    The 18th was even more lively. In the experimental fields of the Liucun production team, a large crowd had gathered: the secretary and ministers of the commune party committee, veteran farmers from the village, and factory workers who had traveled from afar, all waiting for the trial of a new type of agricultural implement. Before long, an "Oriental Red" brand tracked tractor, pulling the new implement that everyone had been waiting for, sped into view, drawing countless eyes. As the tractor pulled the new implement through the crowd, raising a cloud of dust, the deep-plowed field, which had previously been more than a foot and a half deep and difficult to walk through without sinking, was immediately transformed into a smooth, mirror-like surface. What interested everyone even more was that, along with the smoothed field, three straight ridges were built alongside the two six-foot-wide plots of land. The veteran farmers happily ran behind the new implement, eager to see exactly how it could accomplish the five labor-intensive tasks of rolling, harrowing, leveling, smoothing, and ridging all at once. Some veteran farmers stomped on the ground to see if it was rolled firmly, while others stood in the middle of the ridges to check if they were straight. Not even the smallest flaw could escape the eyes of these veteran farmers, but they could not find a single fault with this new implement.
    People praised it endlessly. The women were the happiest; after the implementation of advanced gardening techniques, these tasks required precision and detail, and they described this work as embroidering in the field. Now that they had this new implement, they felt genuinely delighted. Some veteran farmers even started calculating the benefits. Veteran farmers Wang Donglai and Zhang Zhenghai of the Liucun production team, while looking at the well-groomed plots of land, muttered, "For this set of tasks, we can at most work on just over three fen of land a day, but this thing, with one pass, can accomplish more than dozens of us can do in a day." "The workers are thinking of increasingly practical things, and they can conquer even the most difficult tasks." At this point, Zhang Zhenghai added thoughtfully, "In that case, the harrows won't be needed anymore, and the double-shared plow in the warehouse has found a new companion." Wang Donglai saw what he was thinking and interjected, "You're thinking about your double-shared plow again?!" Zhang Zhenghai shook his head: "There's no point in dwelling on the past."
        Worker Brothers are Like Timely Rain
    The story of the double-shared plow goes back many years. After the land reform, although they had all been allocated land, they were often worried because they didn't have enough tools. When they joined mutual aid groups and established agricultural cooperatives, and gradually started using new agricultural implements such as seven-inch step plows and horse-drawn cultivators, they were incredibly happy. As new agricultural implements were added year by year, crop yields also increased year by year. By 1954, the yields of crops such as wheat and cotton had more than doubled compared to the past, with average wheat and cotton yields per mu increasing from just over 100 jin to 230-240 jin and 240-250 jin respectively. At this time, their interest in new agricultural implements grew stronger and stronger, and they hoped that factories would develop more new things. Once, Zhang Zhenghai heard that there was a double-wheeled double-shared plow, and he traveled several miles to a neighboring village to see this new implement. From that day on, he dreamed of using this new thing day and night. His wish finally came true. The first time he used the double-shared plow that didn't require human guidance, a crowd gathered in the field to watch the novelty. He waved his whip, his mouth beaming from ear to ear. From then on, he treated the double-shared plow like a treasure. Unexpectedly, the double-shared plow was only used for a few years before tractors arrived and mechanized farming was implemented, and the double-shared plow was no longer needed. He still liked the "iron ox," but he always felt a sense of nostalgia when he mentioned his old partner, the double-shared plow. Recalling the past, a flood of memories came to mind, Zhang Zhenghai pointed to the tractor speeding across the field: "Do you remember the first time the 'iron ox' plowed our field?" "How could I forget." At that time, a county-wide ceremony was held here to celebrate the advent of mechanized farming, and the crowd surrounded the tractor in layers, reluctant to leave the field from morning until the sun went down. Several years later, not only had the entire field been mechanized, but also, thanks to the continuous support and equipment from industry, the main production processes had been basically mechanized or semi-mechanized. Irrigation and drainage had also been water conservancy, with all twelve mechanical wells in the team being able to take turns watering every ten days on average, so they no longer had to rely on the weather. Last year, the average wheat yield per mu of the Liucun production team had reached more than 350 jin, and the average yield per mu of the 200 mu of wheat in the experimental field had reached more than 730 jin. The cotton yield per mu had also reached more than 340 jin. At present, the most labor-intensive task is the five processes of advanced gardening, but who knew that the workers would bring a new implement specifically for this task. Tracing back these earth-shaking changes, Wang Donglai couldn't help but say: "They make whatever we lack. The implements developed by the workers are more thoughtful than those of us who have been farming all our lives."
    Just as the two veteran farmers were opening up, the tractor-pulled new implement had stopped, and people were calling them from afar to see the structure of the new implement. The commune party secretary, the industrial minister, and others warmly congratulated the workers on the success of the new implement. The measurement results showed that the work done by this implement was not only of high quality and efficiency, with the ability to roll, harrow, level, smooth, and ridge more than 300 mu per day, but it could also save more than 700 laborers, which was really a great joy. Despite the great power of this new implement, its structure was very simple, measuring 15 feet wide and 7 feet long, consisting mainly of wood, except for over a hundred screws and a few iron pieces. This surprised everyone even more.
    Many people wanted to know who created this implement, "Old Qing, tell us quickly." A worker wearing reading glasses was pushed out of the crowd. From the moment this implement was brought to the field, he hadn't stopped for a moment, measuring the dimensions of the ridges; grabbing a handful of soil to see if it was rolled finely enough. Only when everything met the requirements did he feel relieved that his many days of hard work had finally been successful. The excitement made Old Qing not know what to say. After a long time, he pointed to the implement and said, "This is a rolling, harrowing, leveling, smoothing, and ridging combined implement. The pressure roller and blade in front first roll and harrow the ground once, followed by the triangular ridger that divides the soil to both sides, and the ridges are built through the hopper. Finally, the drag bar smooths the ground again." At this point, he smiled, "It was made by a few of us working together, it's very simple."
        Friendship Forged in the Flames of War
    Those who knew the inside story knew that the birth of this combined implement was not simple at all. Old Qing's real name was Zhang Yuqing, and he was a repair worker at the Qizhou People's Commune tractor station. People respectfully called him "Old Qing." This veteran worker with more than 30 years of experience had a life story that constituted an epitome of the continuous development of worker-peasant relations. In his teens, he was forced by life to leave the fields and become an apprentice in an iron factory in Tianjin. As soon as the War of Resistance Against Japan broke out, he resolutely returned to his hometown and joined the People's Self-Defense Force, putting all his energy and skills into the work of manufacturing guns. In order to arm the anti-Japanese forces in the base areas, he manufactured countless weapons to eliminate the enemy with his large, calloused hands. In the harsh years of the enemy's constant mopping-up operations, he persisted in carving out weapons such as rifles, pistols, grenade launchers, and even light machine guns, bit by bit by hand in caves. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he also went to the countryside with workers from the arsenal to lead peasants in the struggle to divide the land. When the peasants were allocated land and began to engage in large-scale production, the arsenal immediately turned to face the countryside, and he also switched from manufacturing guns to manufacturing agricultural implements to fight against the land. His personal experience as a child made him deeply understand the peasants' urgent need for agricultural implements. For more than ten years, with the needs of agricultural development, he also moved from producing simple hand-made and semi-mechanized agricultural implements such as iron shovels, hoes, plows, waterwheels, and bearings, to manufacturing parts for gas generators, boiler and winch units, tractors, and mechanized agricultural implements. After the commune, he came to the tractor station. Seeing these strong and powerful "iron oxen," he really loved them. He felt happier with each additional tractor than with the addition of people. He also took care of all 20 tractors in the station like his own children.
    When the Party put forward the call for industry to vigorously support the technical transformation of agriculture, he thought: Yes, to accelerate agricultural development, we must first find ways to manufacture the mechanized and semi-mechanized agricultural implements that are currently needed. By visiting veteran farmers and soliciting opinions, he learned that the current advanced gardening techniques took up too much labor, which was a key problem. Could we also develop a mechanized agricultural implement? He and another veteran worker at the station, Zheng Ruyan, started working on it together. They researched and designed day and night, and whenever they had free time, they would take some wooden boards and experiment little by little in the yard. As soon as they solved one problem, a new problem would arise. When they encountered difficulties, Old Qing thought: "Never give up. No matter how difficult it is, it's not as difficult as manufacturing machine guns by hand during the War of Resistance. As long as we have the same spirit as we had when we made guns, there's no way we won't succeed." He constantly encouraged his partner: "We can't just do this for a few days and then give up. We must know how much the peasants need this kind of agricultural implement!" Late at night, when everyone was asleep, these two old men were still studying on the bed, discussing each other sentence by sentence. Sometimes, when they figured out a trick, they would immediately get up and experiment. In this way, they gradually solved a series of difficulties such as the ridges not meeting the standards and the ground not being level. This year, when the staff went home for the Spring Festival holiday, these two veteran workers, who were in the middle of their research, didn't even bother to go home. On New Year's Eve, the streets were filled with the sound of firecrackers, but they were busy assembling this combined implement in the workshop. On the second day of the lunar new year, they did the first test in the yard. Although it was still not successful, they had a prototype of the combined implement. After repeated improvements, in less than a month, this new type of rolling, harrowing, leveling, smoothing, and ridging combined implement was finally successful.
    The veteran farmers congratulated Zhang Yuqing and Zheng Ruyan on their success with a grateful heart, and they also solicited their opinions on what improvements could be made and what else they needed. What else could be said? Wang Donglai expressed the common wish of the farmers: "Mechanization is the solution to the problem. In recent years, we have increasingly felt its benefits. In the future, we have no other requirements, we just hope that you can manufacture more mechanized agricultural implements!" These words hit the hearts of workers like Zhang Yuqing and Zheng Ruyan. Zhang Yuqing felt a warmth in his heart, and he finally said the new plan he had been pondering for several days: to manufacture a new agricultural implement for pulling cotton stalks. To pull and bundle cotton stalks on one side; while plowing the land on the other, saving the multiple steps of waiting for the cotton stalks to be pulled out before the machine can plow the land. This move was in line with the minds of the veteran farmers again.
    The sun had already set, and the farmers bid farewell to the returning workers with sincere blessings, deciding that they would meet again here in the near future when the cotton stalk puller was tested.

    永远并肩前进

      一点毛病也挑不出来
    2月，正是阳光融融，春意方浓的季节。安国县祁州人民公社的麦地已经返青，一片葱绿。被翻整过的大秋作物地，腾发着缕缕蒸气，散出一股清香的泥土气味。忙碌着的人们，有的正把机井里抽出来的湍湍细流，灌到麦田；有的在吆喝着牲口、打着鞭哨，几百辆送肥的胶轮大车在地里穿来穿去……田间是一片春忙备耕图景。
    18日这一天就更热闹了。在流村生产队的试验田里，聚集了黑压压的一大群人，公社党委会的书记、部长，村里的老农和远道赶来的工厂工人，都在这里等待一台新式农具的试验。不大一会的功夫，一架“东方红”牌履带式拖拉机拖着人们盼望的新式农具疾驰而来，无数只眼睛都集中了。当拖拉机带着这台新式农具穿过人群，漫起一阵尘烟以后，原来一走就陷脚的一尺五寸多深的深耕地，马上就被整治的像镜面一样平整。更使大伙感兴趣的是，随着平整出的两垅六尺宽的田畦一起还筑起了三道笔直的畦背。老农们高兴得跟在这台新农具后面跑着，都想看个究竟，弄明白怎么会使轧、耙、平、整、筑畦背五道费工的活，一下子都做完了。有的老农用脚跺着地面，看看轧的磁实不磁实，还有的人站到畦背中间检查畦背筑的直不直。哪怕有一点小毛病，也逃不出这些老农们的眼睛，可是对这个新农具却挑不出一点毛病。
    人们赞不绝口地议论开了。妇女们最高兴，实行高级园田化以后，干这套活，要求又精又细，她们都把这种活说成是在地里绣花，现在有了这种新农具，使她们打心眼里觉得痛快。有些老农还在一边算开了账。流村生产队的老农王东来和张正海两个人，一面看着整治好的田畦，一面念叨着：“拾掇这一套活，咱们一个人一天顶多干三分多地，可这家伙一嘟嘟，咱们几十个人干一天也赶不上。”“工人想的玩艺是越来越地道，多么难调理的活也能把它治服了。”说到这，张正海若有所思的补了一句：“这一来，耠子也用不上哩，仓库里的双铧犁算又找着了一个新伴。”王东来看出了他的心思，插了一句：“又想起了你的双铧犁啦！？”张正海摇了摇头：“老皇历还有什么翻头。”
        工人兄弟是及时雨
    提起双铧犁这件事可有年头了。土地改革以后，虽然都分了土地，可是他俩却因为工具不够使常常发愁。等到参加了互助组、成立了农业合作社，逐步地使上了七寸步犁、马拉耘锄等一些新式农具的时候，真不知道有多高兴。随着逐年增添新式农具，农作物的产量也一年比一年提高。到1954年，小麦、棉花等作物的产量就比过去翻了一番，小麦和棉花的平均亩产量分别由一百多斤提高到二百三、四十斤到二百四、五十斤。这时，他们对新式农具的兴趣也就越来越浓厚，盼不得工厂多琢磨出点新东西。有一次张正海听说有了双轮双铧犁，他曾跑到好几里地远的外村看这种新农具，从这一天开始，他日夜想着也使上这个新东西。愿望到底实现了，他第一次使上不用人扶的双铧犁耕地时，地里围了一群人看新鲜，他扬着鞭子，美滋滋的连嘴都合不上了。从此，他对待双铧犁就像对待宝贝一样。没想到，双铧犁没使用几年，又来了拖拉机，实行了机耕，双铧犁又用不上了。他对“铁牛”故然喜欢，可一提到双铧犁这个老伙伴，还总有些旧情。一提起往事就千头万绪涌上心头，张正海指着地里奔驰的拖拉机：“还记得‘铁牛’第一次在咱们地里耕地吗？”“怎么不记得。”当时曾在这里举行了全县万人机耕典礼大会，人山人海的把拖拉机围得里三层、外三层，从早晨直到没了太阳，人们还舍不得离开地头。事隔几年，不仅整个的地都实现了机耕，而且通过工业不断的支援和武装，主要的生产工序已经基本上做到了机械化、半机械化，排灌也实现了水利化，全队十二眼机井，平均每十天就能轮流浇上一次水，再也不用靠天吃饭了。去年流村生产队小麦的平均亩产量已经达到三百五十多斤，试验田的二百多亩麦子，平均亩产量达到七百三十多斤。棉花的亩产量也达到三百四十多斤。目前主要费工的活要算高级园田化的五道工序，谁知工人们又给送来了专治这活的新农具。追溯起这些翻天复地的变化，王东来情不自禁地说道：缺什么就给造什么，工人们琢磨出的农具，比咱们干了一辈子庄稼活的人还想得周到。”
    正当两个老农拉开话匣子的时候，拖拉机牵引的新农具已停了下来，远远的有人喊他们去看新农具的构造。公社党委书记、工业部长等热烈地向工人们祝贺新农具的成功。测算结果，这种农具做出来的活，不但质量好、效率高，一天可以轧、耙、平、整、筑畦背三百多亩，而且可以节省七百多名劳动力，这可真是件大喜事。别看这台新农具有这么大的威力，它的构造却很简单，一共有十五尺宽、七尺长，其中除了一百多个螺丝和很少的一些铁片外，主要的是一些木料。这就更使大家感到惊奇。
    许多人都想知道这农具是谁创造的，“老庆，你快说说吧。”在人堆里推出一个戴着老花镜的工人，从这台农具拉到地里，他就一直没闲着，一会量量畦田和畦背的尺寸；一会抓一把泥土看看轧的碎不碎，各项都合乎要求，才使他塌下心来，多日的心血终于获得了成功。激动的心情倒使老庆不知道说什么才好，半天，他才指着这台农具说：“这是个轧、耙、平、整、筑畦联合器，前面安着的镇压器和盖擦先把地轧、耙一个过，后面跟着用三角拥土器把土分到两旁，通过漏斗筑成畦背，最后由拖棍再把地平整一下。”说到这，他笑了笑：“几个人一块土闹的，很简单。”
        战火中成长的友谊
    了解底细的人都知道，这台联合器的诞生，实在并不简单。老庆本来叫张玉庆，是祁州人民公社拖拉机站的修配工人，人们都尊敬地称他“老庆”。这个有着三十多年工龄的老工人，一生的经历构成了一幅工农关系不断发展的缩影。他十几岁就被生活所逼，离开了田地到天津一家铁工厂当了学徒工。抗日战争一爆发，他又毅然地回到家乡参加了人民自卫军，把精力和手艺全部放到制造枪械的工作上。为了武装根据地的抗日队伍，在他那双粗大而带着老茧的手里，不知制造了多少消灭敌人的武器。在敌人不断扫荡的艰苦岁月里，就坚持在地洞里用手工一点一点地硬刻出大枪、手枪、掷弹筒，甚至轻机枪等武器。抗日战争胜利以后，他又曾和兵工厂的工人一道到农村领导农民进行平分土地的斗争，在农民分得了土地开始进行大生产的时候，兵工厂又立即面向农村，他也就又由制造枪械转为制造向土地开战的农具。童年的切身遭遇，使他深深懂得农民迫切需要农具的心情，十多年来，随着农业发展的需要，他也由最初生产简单的铁铣、镐、锄、犁、水车、轴承等手工和半机械化的农具，到制造煤气机、锅驼机、拖拉机的机件和机械化的农具。公社化以后他来到拖拉机站，看到这些结实有力的“铁牛”，真有点爱不释手，每增加一台拖拉机，他感觉比添人口还高兴，他对全站的二十台拖拉机也就像对待自己孩子似的备加爱护。
    当党提出工业大力支援农业技术改造的号召以后，他想：对呀，农业要加快发展，首先要想法多制造当前需要的机械化、半机械化农具。他通过访问老农，征求意见，了解到当前高级园田化，占用劳动力太多是个关键问题，能不能也搞个机械化的农具呢？他就和站里另一个老工人郑如烟一块琢磨上了。他们日夜地研究着、设计着，一有空就拿些木板在院子里一点点地试验，刚解决一个问题，又出来一个新问题，遇到了困难，老庆就想：“决不罢手，再困难也没有抗战时期用手工制造机枪困难，只要有当初造枪那股劲头，就没有不成功的。”他不断地鼓励着同伴：“咱们可别弄个三天两早晨的就算完了。要知道农民是多么需要这种农具啊！”深夜里，人们都睡熟的时候，这两个老人还在床上你一句我一句的研究着，有时研究出一个窍门，立即爬起来就试验，就这样一步一步地解决着畦背不合规格、地不平整等一系列的困难。今年春节职工们都放假回家的时候，这两个正研究到劲头上的老工人连家都没顾得回。年夜，大街上一片鞭炮声，他俩却在车间里忙着安装这台联合器，农历正月初二，他们在院子里做了第一次试验。虽然仍旧没有成功，但却有了联合器的雏型。经过反复的改进，前后不到一个月的时间，这台新式的轧、耙、平、整、筑畦联合器终于最后成功了。
    老农们用一种感激的心情祝贺着张玉庆、郑如烟的成功，而他们也向老农们征求有什么改进的意见以及还需要什么。还有什么可说的呢？农民们的共同愿望被王东来说出来了：“机械化就是解决问题，这几年可越来越感觉出它的好处啦。今后，没别的要求，只希望你们多制造一些机械化的农具吧！”这些话正说到张玉庆和郑如烟等工人的心坎，张玉庆觉得心里有些热烘烘的，他终于又说出来已经盘算了几天的新打算：再制造一种拔棉花秸的新农具。做到一面拔、捆棉花秸；一面就耕了地，省得机器等着拔完棉花秸才能耕地的多道工序。这一招可又合乎了老农的心事。
    太阳已经偏西，农民们以诚恳的祝福送别了回去的工人，他们决定不久的将来，在这里试验拔棉秸器的时候再会面。
