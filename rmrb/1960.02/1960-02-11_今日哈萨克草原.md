    Today's Kazakh Grassland
    By our correspondents Tan Feng and Ding Wen
    Driving south from Urumqi for over a hundred li, and climbing over several mountain passes, you reach the new residential area of the Gan'gou Brigade of the Dongfeng People's Commune on the Tianshan Grassland. I remember when we came here in 1957, there were only a few scattered mud houses on the hillside. In just over two years, a long new street has been hidden in the layers of spruce forests. Close to the street, there is a row of newly built houses with white paint, which is the settlement of the Kazakh herdsmen who have moved down the mountain. Factories, schools, clinics, supply and marketing cooperatives, and veterinary stations are established on both sides of the street. In the morning, the herdsmen drive their livestock to graze on the long slopes of the mountains, and tractors, sledges, and carts transporting fertilizer come and go. The Young Pioneers ride horses to school. The mountain valley, which has been silent for many years, is now a scene of vitality.
    The brigade cadres told us that "Poor Gan'gou" has undergone amazing changes in all aspects during the year of communization. A year ago, it was still a small mountain village with only seventy households, but now it has become a residential area for 280 peasant and herdsmen households. Eight pastoral and agricultural cooperatives formed the Gan'gou Brigade, and they built a batch of houses, canteens, and factories here. About two hundred Kazakh herdsmen walked out of the mountains and settled here, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and engaging in diversified operations. In 1959, the number of livestock in the brigade increased from more than 10,600 to more than 39,900. 4,800 mu of wasteland was turned into an oasis. Sideline occupations such as milk powder manufacturing, brick burning, meat processing, and transportation developed like mushrooms after a spring rain. Truly, every team is improving production, and every household is increasing income. The wages of the commune members for each labor day increased from three jiao in 1958 to one yuan. All more than 500 peasant and herdsmen households in the brigade increased their income.

            True Herdsmen
    One morning, we visited the old herdsman Talitebai, who has many children and few laborers. When we arrived at Talitebai's house, the owner had gone to the mountain to fetch grass for the cows that were about to give birth, and his wife was making milk tea. The house was very spacious, with a large pile of quilts neatly placed on the wooden box. A tin stove was placed in the middle of the house, and the fire was burning vigorously. As soon as you enter the door, you feel that the owner's life is quite good. While we were chatting with the hostess, a vigorous old man came in, this was Talitebai. In the old society, Talitebai had no livestock, and his family worked as shepherds for the herd owners. His wife milked cows for others, and after a year of work, they could only exchange it for a few dou of highland barley to feed themselves. In winter, the whole family huddled in a broken felt tent that did not block the wind and snow. The children cried from the cold. He himself wore a sheepskin all year round and had not worn a new piece of clothing for more than fifty years. After liberation, Talitebai's painful life came to an end. He excitedly told us: "The Communist Party's eyes are brighter than 'Khuda' (God)'s eyes. As soon as they came, they convened a meeting of eighteen poor people and gave me nine sheep, making me a true herdsman with livestock for the first time." Since then, the life of Talitebai's family has improved day by day, but Talitebai felt uneasy in his heart: he was almost seventy years old, and his six children were still young. He relied on government relief every year. The Communist Party's kindness was as high and deep as the sky, but when could he live by his own labor? Every time he went to the township government to collect relief grain, his steps slowed down. After communization, Talitebai's problem was solved. The commune implemented a food supply system, and the whole family also received more than 30 yuan in wages every month. In addition to eating, last year his wage income alone was more than 500 yuan. Talitebai turned from an old overdraft household to a surplus household for the first time. Five older children sewed new clothes and bought new shoes and socks. His wife wore high-top leather boots for the first time in her life. His seventeen-year-old eldest son was supplied with all expenses by the government to attend high school, and his thirteen-year-old daughter went to elementary school. Talking about these things, the old man smiled happily. This old man is now living younger and more energetic, working harder and harder, going out early and returning late every day, driving the cattle to graze on the sunny hillside. The eighty-nine cows he grazed have given birth to eighty-five calves, all of which have survived. "The stars chase the moon, I rely on the Communist Party!" This was the last sentence the old man said to us when we parted.

            Model Sisters-in-law
    Communization has brought many fresh things to the grassland. Kazakh women, who for thousands of years could only milk cows and guard tents, have walked out of the tents and served as livestock veterinary technicians, workers, accountants, and health workers, giving full play to their talents.
    There is a pair of young sisters-in-law in the settlement. The elder sister-in-law, Hiying Jamal, works in the milk powder factory, and the younger sister-in-law, Zilaihan, is a livestock veterinary technician in the brigade. They both work very well, and at the end of last year, they were both selected as labor models and attended the county labor model conference together. Recently, the two of them joined the Communist Youth League together. The old and young herdsmen there are all vying to praise this pair of model sisters-in-law.
    When Zilaihan started learning to artificially inseminate ewes, some people laughed at her and said, "Zilaihan, how can a young woman do this!" She said nonchalantly, "This is the same as you growing crops, what's so funny?" When we saw Zilaihan, she was living in Ulazi's house, helping to deliver lambs. Ulazi is the leader of this grazing group. They graze 280 ewes together. These ewes were all artificially inseminated by Zilaihan in August last year. Ulazi's wife told us: "Zilaihan is really a capable daughter-in-law. None of the 280 ewes she helped inseminate were empty. We will have a good harvest of lambs again."
    Hiying Jamal and 60 women in the brigade worked as producers in the milk powder factory. They used their hands to make milk into white milk powder. Last year, they produced more than 23,000 kilograms of milk powder, increasing the brigade's income by more than 140,000 yuan.

            Wish Realized
    After communization, the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry was realized, and the Kazakh herdsmen who had lived by water and grass for generations settled down and participated in agricultural production. When we arrived at the Gan'gou Brigade, we happened to see a Kazakh young man skillfully driving a tractor. It was really exciting to see herdsmen driving tractors on this grassland surrounded by mountains.
    One evening six years ago, a tractor drove into the Tianshan Grassland, and the roar of the machine shook the valley. The herdsmen who had never seen a tractor stood far away, pointing and discussing. Thirteen-year-old Mu Hanmode ignored the adults' obstruction and ran to the tractor, looking up and down with curious eyes. He saw this huge iron guy, shining with two bowl-sized eyes, a young soldier sitting steadily on it, pulling a large cart of wood behind it, running forward like a horse. Mu Hanmode was fascinated: "This People's Liberation Army soldier must be a hero, otherwise how could he pull a cart that dozens of horses can't move?" From then on, Mu Hanmode was determined to become a tractor driver.
    The commune was established, and the six pastoral cooperatives and two agricultural cooperatives of Gan'gou merged into one brigade. As a result, Mu Hanmode's wish to drive a tractor became more and more urgent. In June last year, the Gan'gou Brigade bought a tractor, and Mu Hanmode received the news that he was being transferred to be an assistant to the tractor driver. This good news, which seemed to have fallen from the sky, made Mu Hanmode so happy that he didn't sleep all night. From the next day, as long as there was the sound of a motor on the road, he would run to the side of the road to see if the tractor was coming. He waited like this for ten full days, and the tractor came.
    New difficulties arose, tractor driver Ke Defu couldn't speak Kazakh, and Mu Hanmode couldn't speak Chinese, what to do? He carefully observed every movement of Ke Defu every day, and spelled out all the machine names into Kazakh and wrote them in his notebook. When he finished work, he still stayed by the tractor, wiping the machine while speculating on Ke Defu's gestures. At night, when others were asleep, he still lay in bed and recited the function of the throttle and gear lever. Whenever he met a Kazakh tractor driver, he would repeatedly ask them about the difficult problems he had recorded. Hard study enabled Mu Hanmode to become familiar with all the mechanical names and their performance in two months, and he could drive short-distance transportation alone. When we saw him recently, not only was his driving skill very skilled, but he could also completely repair minor faults in the locomotive alone.

            New Style Wedding
    The wedding of poor herdsmen Sima Yi and Jia Wale, which had been postponed for three years, was finally held recently. The bride's mother, Ka Yizan, broke the old Kazakh custom of not asking the son-in-law to send horses or money before the wedding, and invited the son-in-law to her home to hold a "new style" wedding. The herdsmen from far and near are spreading this marriage as a beautiful story, saying that this is an unusual new phenomenon brought about by communization. In the old society, the Kazakh pastoral areas were rife with the marriage-for-sale system, and the huge amount of betrothal gifts and complicated wedding ceremonies made it as difficult for poor herdsmen to get married as climbing a high mountain. Herdsmen who originally had very few livestock often went bankrupt in order to marry a wife. After liberation, the government promulgated a new marriage law, abolished the marriage-for-sale system, and young men and women had the right to choose their partners freely. However, the influence of old habits on people's thinking cannot be completely eliminated all at once. This is the reason why the marriage of Sima Yi and Jia Wale was delayed.
    Sima Yi and Jia Wale are childhood friends. After cooperation, they fell in love with each other in common labor and got engaged in 1957. According to local customs, after the engagement, they should get married after a period of time. However, Ka Yizan had a knot in her heart that had not been untied. Jia Wale is her most beloved youngest daughter, and she wanted her daughter to be "glorious" when she got married, but Sima Yi's family had a large population and was not wealthy. From the day her daughter got engaged, she had been in this contradictory mood and hesitated. The young people sensed the old man's thoughts from his face, and no matter how many times the two of them whispered by the spring, they were afraid that the old man would object, and had never spoken. The wedding date was postponed again and again, dragging on for three years, until the realization of the people's commune, the implementation of free meals, and wages for labor, which changed Ka Yizan's thinking and finally opened the mouth to her daughter to get married. When we congratulated the old couple Ka Yizan on their daughter's marriage, the old people said proudly: "The two of them grew up in front of us, and they have a mutual understanding. Although they didn't send us anything, now that we have communization, we have food and clothing, and both of them have jobs, so why worry about not having a good life in the future!"

    今日哈萨克草原
    本报记者　谈风　丁文
    乘汽车从乌鲁木齐南行百余里，爬过几道山口，便到了天山草原上东风人民公社甘沟大队的新居民区。记得1957年我们到这里时，山坡上只有几间寥寥可数的土房子。不过两年多光景，长长的一条新街道隐没在层层叠叠的云杉丛林里。紧靠大街，出现了一排排粉刷洁白的新房，这就是下山定居的哈萨克牧民的定居点。厂房、学校、医务所、供销社和畜牧兽医站建立在大街两旁。早晨，牧民们驱赶畜群到山上长坡放牧，运送肥料的拖拉机、爬犁、马车往来不绝。“红领巾”骑着马急急赶到学校去上课。寂静了多少年的山沟，如今是一片生气勃勃的景象。
    大队的干部告诉我们，“穷甘沟”在公社化一年中，各方面都发生了惊人变化。一年以前，这里还是一个只有七十户人家的小山村，现在已经变成了二百八十户农牧民的居民区了。八个牧业社和农业社组成了甘沟大队，在这里大兴土木，建造了一批住房、食堂和厂房，二百户左右的哈萨克牧民走出深山，定居在这里，农牧并举，大搞多种经营。1959年大队的大小牲畜由一万零六百多头增加到三万九千九百多头，四千八百亩荒地变成了绿洲，制造奶粉、烧砖、肉食加工、运输等副业像雨后春笋般的发展起来。真是队队提高生产，户户增加收入。社员每个劳动日工资从1958年的三角，提高到一元，全大队五百多户农牧民全部增加了收入。
            真正的牧民
    一天上午，我们访问了孩子多、劳力少的老牧民塔里特拜。我们到塔里特拜家时，主人正到山上给就要生产的母牛拉草去了，他的妻子正在烧奶茶。屋子很宽大，木箱上整齐地放着一大叠被子，屋子中间安放着一个洋铁皮炉子，炉火烧得很旺。一进门就使人感到主人的光景是颇不错的。当我们正和主妇拉家常时，一个精神健旺的老人进来了，这就是塔里特拜。塔里特拜在旧社会时没有牲畜，一家人都给牧主放羊，妻子给人家挤奶子，劳动一年只能换回几斗青稞糊口。到了冬天，全家挤在一个不挡风雪的破毡子帐篷里，孩子冻的哇哇哭，他自己是一张羊皮穿四季，五十多年没有穿过一件新衣服。解放了，塔里特拜痛苦的生活才算到了尽头。他兴奋地对我们说：“共产党的眼睛比‘胡达’（上帝）眼睛亮，刚一来就召集我们十八户穷人开会，并救济了我九只羊，使我第一次成了有牲畜的真正牧民。”从此，塔里特拜一家人的生活一天一天好起来，但是塔里特拜内心有一件事不安：自己快七十岁了，六个孩子又小，年年靠政府救济，共产党的恩情天高地厚，可我什么时候能靠自己劳动过活呢？每一次领救济粮走到乡政府门前时，他的脚步就迟缓下来。公社化之后，塔里特拜的这个问题解决了。公社实行了伙食供给制，每月全家还领到三十多元的工资。除去吃饭，去年光工资收入就有五百多元，塔里特拜第一次由老超支户变成了有余户，五个大孩子都缝了新衣服，买了新鞋袜，他的妻子有生以来第一次穿上了高筒皮靴。十七岁的大儿子由政府供应全部费用上了高中，十三岁的女儿上了小学。谈到这些，老人笑的合不拢嘴。这位老人现在越活越年青，越干越有劲，每天早出晚归，赶着牛群到向阳山坡放牧，他放牧的八十九头母牛，已经生了八十五头小牛，全部成活。“星星赶月亮，我靠的是共产党！”这是临别时老人对我们说的一句话。
            妯娌模范
    公社化使草原上出现了许多新鲜的事情，千百年来只能挤挤牛奶、看守帐篷的哈萨克族妇女走出了帐篷，分别担任了畜牧兽医技术员、工人、会计、保健员，发挥了她们的才智。
    在定居点上有一对年轻的妯娌，嫂嫂哈英加玛勒在奶粉厂工作，弟媳孜来汗是大队畜牧兽医技术员。她们工作都很出色，去年年底同时被选为劳动模范，一起出席了全县劳模大会。最近两个人又双双加入了共青团。那里的老小牧民都争夸这一对模范妯娌。
    孜来汗开始学习给母羊作人工配种时，有些人取笑她说：“孜来汗，年轻媳妇怎么干这一行！”她毫不介意地说：“这和你们种庄稼一样，有什么好笑的？”我们看见孜来汗时，她正住在乌拉孜家里，帮着接羊羔。乌拉孜是这个放牧组的组长，他们共牧放着二百八十只生产母羊，这群母羊都是去年8月间由孜来汗进行人工授精的。乌拉孜的妻子告诉我们：“孜来汗可真是个能干的媳妇，她帮助配的二百八十只母羊没有一个空胎，我们的羊羔又要丰收了。”
    哈英加玛勒和大队里六十名妇女担任了奶粉厂的制作员，她们用自己的双手把牛奶制成洁白的奶粉。去年她们生产了二万三千多公斤奶粉，为大队增加了十四万多元的收入。
          愿望实现了
    公社化以后，实现了农牧业结合，世代逐水草而居的哈萨克牧民定居下来，参加了农业生产。我们到甘沟大队时，正碰上一个哈萨克小伙子熟练地驾驶着拖拉机。在这群山环抱的草原上能看到牧民开拖拉机，实在叫人兴奋。
    六年前的一个晚上，有一部拖拉机开进了天山草原，机器的轰鸣声震撼山谷。从未见过拖拉机的牧民都站得远远的，指指点点的议论着。十三岁的木汗莫德不顾大人的拦阻，跑到拖拉机旁边，用好奇的眼睛上下打量着。只见这个庞大的铁家伙，闪着两只碗大的眼睛，一个年轻的战士稳稳地坐在上边，后面拖着一大车木料，像马一样向前跑去。木汗莫德看的出了神：“这个解放军一定是个英雄，不然几十匹马拉不动的大车，他怎能拖着跑？”从此，木汗莫德下定决心要当个拖拉机手。
    公社成立了，甘沟的六个牧业社和两个农业社合并成一个大队。这一来，木汗莫德盼望开拖拉机的愿望也越来越迫切了。去年6月，甘沟大队买了一部拖拉机，木汗莫德接到了调他给拖拉机手当助手的消息。这个像从天上降下来的喜讯，使木汗莫德高兴的一夜没有合眼，从第二天起只要大路上一有马达的响声，他就要跑到大路边看一看是不是拖拉机来了。他这样整整等了十天，拖拉机来了。
    新的困难又来了，拖拉机手柯德福不会说哈萨克话，木汗莫德又不会讲汉话，怎么办呢？他就天天细心观察柯德福的每一个动作，把所有的机器名称都拼成哈萨克文记在本子上。收工了，他仍留在拖拉机旁，一边擦着机器，一边揣测柯德福的手势。夜里别人都睡着了，他还躺在床上念叨油门排挡的作用，一碰见哈萨克族的拖拉机手，他便把自己记下来的难题，一次一次地请教他们。艰苦的学习使木汗莫德在两个月的时间内熟悉了所有的机械名称和它们的性能，一个人可以驾驶着进行短途运输了。最近我们看见他的时候，不仅驾驶技术很熟练，就是机车发生了小毛病，他也完全能单独修理了。
            新式婚礼
    贫苦牧民司马益和加娃勒推延了三年的婚礼，最近终于举行了。新娘的母亲卡一赞打破了哈萨克的老习惯，不要女婿在婚前送马、送金钱，并且把女婿请到自己家里举行“新式”婚礼。远近牧民把这件婚事当作一段佳话传述着，说这是公社化带来不寻常的新气象。在旧社会，哈萨克牧区流传着买卖婚姻制，巨额财礼和繁复的婚仪耗费，使贫苦牧民结婚像攀登高山一样困难。本来牲畜就很少的牧民，常为娶一个妻子弄得倾家荡产。解放以后，政府颁行了新婚姻法，废除了买卖婚姻制度，青年男女才有了自由选择对象的权利。但是，旧习惯势力在人们思想上的影响，还不能一下子清除干净。这就是司马益和加娃勒婚事拖延的原因。
    司马益和加娃勒是一对青梅竹马的朋友，合作化后，他们在共同劳动中彼此相爱，1957年就订了婚。按照当地习惯，订婚之后，隔一段时间就要结婚。但是卡一赞心里有一个疙瘩没有解开。加娃勒是她最钟爱的小女儿，她想让女儿出嫁时“光彩”一些，可是司马益家里人口多，并不富裕。从女儿订婚那一天起，她就怀着这种矛盾心情，踌躇不决。年轻人从脸色上探知老人的心思，不知有多少次两个人在泉边林下喁喁私谈，但怕老人反对，一直没有开言。婚期一再推迟，一拖三年，一直到实现了人民公社化，实行了吃饭不要钱，劳动有工资，这才改变了卡一赞的思想，终于向女儿开了成亲的口。当我们向卡一赞老夫妇祝贺他们女儿的婚事时，老人们得意地说：“两人都是我们跟前长大的，图个心投意合。虽然没有送什么东西给我们，但现在公社化了，有吃有穿，两人又都有工作，还愁将来没有好生活！”
