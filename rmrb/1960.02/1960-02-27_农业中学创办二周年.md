    The second anniversary of the founding of agricultural middle schools.
    Lu Dingyi
    It has been two years since the founding of agricultural middle schools. This is a good thing.
    Experience has proven that running agricultural middle schools is an important method for developing secondary education in a faster, better, and more economical way. Statistics from Jiangsu Province show that the state spends more than 180 yuan per year to train a student in an ordinary junior high school, while it only costs more than ten yuan to train a student in an agricultural middle school. The family burden of students has also been reduced from more than 100 yuan per year to more than 30 yuan. Agricultural middle schools require fewer teachers than ordinary junior high schools to train the same number of students. Although students in agricultural middle schools study fewer subjects, because they study and work part-time, they can apply the knowledge they have learned to production more quickly. Also, because they have production experience, their understanding of the courses they study is deeper and more solid. These are very obvious facts that no one can refute.
    The cause of agricultural middle schools will cultivate a group of teachers who are both red and expert. Some of these teachers are cadres who have been sent to lower levels, and most are high school graduates. They go to the countryside to run education, teach, and participate in labor. It was not without difficulties at the beginning. Under the leadership of the Party, they overcame these difficulties, took on the cause of agricultural middle schools, and became one with the peasants. Thus, they became new people, intellectual workers who have been laborized, and educational workers who have close ties with the peasants. They are not afraid of difficulties and go to more difficult posts to temper themselves. In this respect, they remind people of the young people who went from the cities to Yan'an and the liberated areas during the revolutionary period. They have a great future. It is entirely believable that among them will grow very good communists and very good educational workers.
    However, the significance of agricultural middle schools is not limited to this.
    For many years, secondary education could not enter the countryside, and middle school students could not stay in the countryside. In the old society, some people talked a lot about rural education, but in the end, they did not achieve any results. In our socialist society, agricultural middle schools have been established for two years, and junior high school education has taken root in the countryside, becoming a "treasure" and "gold." Once this root is planted, it is no small matter. From then on, we can hope that, with the development of production, especially the development of agricultural mechanization, senior high school education, secondary vocational education, and higher education will appear in the countryside. From then on, we can hope that not only middle school students, but also college students and university graduates will be able to stay in the countryside. This is a great joy. With this, the realization of communism truly has hope. Eighty percent of our population is in the countryside. If the culture of the countryside is not high, the cultural revolution will not be successful, and communism cannot be realized. To achieve communism, we must, in this 80% of the population, as in the urban population, realize the popularization and improvement of universal education with the development of production. Therefore, the rooting of agricultural middle schools in the countryside is a very remarkable thing. This is a step forward towards eliminating the differences between urban and rural areas, between workers and peasants, and between mental and physical labor.
    According to estimates by relevant parties, when the mechanization of agriculture in our country is fundamentally solved, our country will need 1.84 million agricultural machinery drivers and 440,000 technical cadres. This is just in terms of agriculture. In addition, the people's communes also need many cadres to run industry, education, health, childcare, finance and trade, and other aspects. With secondary education in our rural areas, there is an ample source of these cadres.
    Agricultural middle schools have been established for two years and have more than 2 million students. In the past two years, the average number of students enrolled each year, excluding the number of those who move, has reached 1 million. If we use this number to calculate (and it will certainly be more than this in the future), then in another ten years, 9 million people can graduate. Isn't this a very considerable force?
    Now, some places have already started running agricultural high schools. This is a very good thing. Half-day agricultural high schools absorb young people over the age of sixteen, who are a full labor force in the countryside. Now, due to the economic conditions of the people's communes and the lack of labor in agriculture, part-time high schools can be run without limit, but half-day high schools cannot be run a lot at once, but they will gradually increase in the future. Agricultural high schools can be run with two kinds of characteristics. One is a secondary vocational school, training intermediate technical cadres. There are many kinds of intermediate cadres, and you can run whatever is needed. The other is a senior high school, whose students are prepared to enter universities in the future, and are trained to become senior technical and theoretical cadres. The people's commune Party committees should now make plans for these two kinds of agricultural high schools, and consider them together with the development plans of the people's communes and the arrangement of labor. In order to run these two kinds of agricultural high schools, cities should provide active assistance.
    Next year is the third year of the establishment of agricultural middle schools, and the first batch of students will graduate. I hope everyone will work hard to ensure that these graduates have good results. In addition to a part of these graduates entering high school, most of them should be given various technical training to serve the countryside, and they should also be organized to continue their spare-time studies. Only when production benefits can agricultural middle schools be completely consolidated.
    Thank you to all the teachers and staff of the agricultural middle schools for their hard work, and thank you to all parties for their strong support of the agricultural middle schools. I wish them not to be arrogant or impetuous, continue to work hard, overcome difficulties, and strive to accelerate socialist construction and strive for the great ideal of communism.

    农业中学创办二周年
    陆定一
    农业中学创办了两年了。这是一件好事。
    经验已经证明，办农业中学，是多快好省地发展中等教育的一个重要方法。江苏省的统计表明，为了培养一个普通初中的学生，国家每年要花一百八十多元，而为了培养一个农业中学的学生，只要花十几元。学生的家庭负担，也从每年一百多元减为三十多元。培养同量的学生，农业中学比普通初中所需教师更少。农业中学的学生，虽然学的科目较少，但因为半耕半读，因而能够较快地把学到的知识用在生产上，又因为有了生产实践，所以对于所学课程的理解也比较深刻，比较牢固。这些都是很明显的事实，是谁也驳不倒的。
    农业中学这件事业，将会培养出一批又红又专的教师。这些教师，一部分是下放干部，大部分是高中毕业的学生。他们到乡下去办教育，又要教书，又要参加劳动，开始的时候不是没有困难的。在党的领导下，他们克服了这些困难，把农业中学的事业担当起来，同农民打成一片，于是，他们就成了新人，成了劳动化了的知识分子，成了同农民有密切联系的教育工作者。他们不怕困难，到比较艰苦的岗位上去，锻炼自己。在这一点上，他们令人想起过去革命时期从城市里投奔延安、投奔解放区的青年们。他们前程远大。完全可以相信，在他们之中，将会生长出很好的共产主义者，很好的教育工作者。
    但是，农业中学的意义还不止于此。
    多少年来，中等教育进不了农村，农村里也留不住中学生。在旧社会里，有些人大谈其农村教育，结果是什么成绩也做不出来。在我们这个社会主义社会里，农业中学办了两年，初中教育就在乡村里扎下根，成了“宝贝”“金子”了。这个根一扎下去，就非同小可。从此，我们就可以希望，随着生产的发展，首先是农业机械化的发展，在农村中将会出现高中教育、中等专业教育以及高等教育。从此，我们就可以希望，农村里不但留得住中学生，而且留得住大学生和大学毕业生。这是一件大喜事。有了这件事，共产主义的实现才真正有了希望。我们人口80％在农村，如果农村的文化不高，文化革命就没有成功，共产主义也无法实现。我们要实现共产主义，必须在这80％的人口中，也像在城市人口中一样，随着生产的发展，实现全民教育的普及和提高。所以，农业中学在农村扎下根，是一件很了不起的事情。这是向消灭城乡差别，消灭工农差别，消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别，前进一步。
    据有关方面估算，等到我国农业机械化根本解决的时候，我国需要农业机械驾驶员一百八十四万人，技术干部四十四万人。这是光说农业方面。除此以外，人民公社还需要许多办工业的、办教育的、办卫生事业的、办保育事业的、做财贸工作的以及其他方面的干部。我们农村里有了中等教育，这大批干部就有了充足来源。
    农业中学办了两年，有二百多万学生，过去两年中每年入学的学生，除了流动数，平均达一百万人。如果就用这个数字来算（将来必不止此数），再过十年，就可以毕业九百万人。这不是很可观的力量么？
    现在，有些地方已经办起农业高中。这是很好的事情。半日制的农业高中，吸收的是十六岁以上的青年，他们在农村中是全劳动力。现在限于人民公社的经济条件，和由于农业中劳动力尚感缺乏，业余的高中可以没有限制地办，半日制的高中还不能一下子办得很多，但是将来一定会逐渐多起来的。农业高中，可以办两种性质的。一种是中等专业学校，训练中级的技术干部。中级干部种类很多，可以要啥办啥。一种是高级中学，它的学生准备将来升入高等学校，训练成为高级的技术干部和理论干部。这两种农业高中，人民公社党委现在就要做计划，要同人民公社的发展计划和劳动力的安排一起考虑。为了办这两种农业高中，城市应当予以积极的援助。
    明年是农业中学成立的第三年，将有第一批学生毕业。希望大家努力，使这批毕业生有很好的成绩。这批毕业生除了一部分进高中以外，大部分要给以各种技术训练，为农村服务，同时还应该组织他们继续进行业余的学习。要使生产得到实惠，农业中学才能完全巩固下来。
    感谢农业中学全体教师和工作人员的辛勤劳动，感谢各方面对农业中学的大力支持。祝他们不骄不躁，继续努力，克服困难，为加速社会主义建设而奋斗，为共产主义的远大理想而奋斗。
