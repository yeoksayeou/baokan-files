“Small Modern Groups” Advance Victoriously

In 1959, the "small modern groups" wrote a brand new chapter in the history of our country's socialist construction. Of the total national output of pig iron, the pig iron produced by the small and medium-sized blast furnaces of local enterprises alone accounted for more than one-half; of the total steel output, the small and medium-sized converters accounted for more than one-third; small and medium-sized mines produced about half of all iron ore; small coal mines produced about one-fifth of all coal; small cement plants produced about one-seventh of all cement; more than three-quarters of the coke was produced by simple coke ovens and indigenous coke ovens; in 1959, the "small modern groups" already occupied a pivotal position in the great leap forward of the national economy.

The tremendous role played by the "small modern groups" enterprises in the national economy in 1959 once again proved that the policy of "walking on two legs" of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong is the only correct policy to enable our country's socialist construction to achieve a great leap forward. Under the guidance of the general line and a complete set of policies of "walking on two legs," the development speed of our country's industry, agriculture, transportation, and other economic and cultural undertakings has been raised to a level more than double that of the first five-year plan period. This is a great revolutionary creation. Taking industry as an example, the average annual growth rate of industry in capitalist countries in the past century is generally about 3% to 5%, with the United States during World War II being the fastest growing. From 1939 to 1943, due to the extremely special conditions at the time, the annual growth rate of industry in the United States once reached 22%. However, in 1958 and 1959, the development speed of our country's industry far exceeded this level, reaching 66.2% and 39.3% respectively. This fact shows that, whether from a theoretical or practical point of view, the Party's policy of "walking on two legs" is a revolutionary creation with great historical significance.

In 1960, the "small modern groups" must take a big step forward on the existing basis. We must launch a large-scale technical innovation and technical revolution movement in all the "small modern groups" enterprises across the country, and raise the "small modern groups" to a new and higher level.

We are believers in continuous revolution, and this is how we treat revolution; and this is how we treat construction. For us, implementing the policy of "walking on two legs" is a process of continuous creation, continuous development, and continuous improvement. The standards of "modern" and "indigenous," "large" and "small" are relative. What seems indigenous today may be transformed into modern tomorrow; what seems small today may develop into large tomorrow. Weren't the small indigenous furnaces that were born in our country's mass movement of the whole people running steel in 1958 looked down upon by some people because of their indigenousness and smallness? However, it has great vitality. The small indigenous furnaces, blooming everywhere and radiating red light all over the country, completed the transition to "small modern groups" within only one year, and some "small modern groups" even became "medium modern groups." In this way, we increased the output of modern steel by more than 60% in 1959 alone, and prepared sufficient equipment capacity for the continued leap forward in 1960. Walking on two legs, combining modern and indigenous methods, starting with indigenous methods, moving from indigenous to modern, and developing from small to large, is both down-to-earth and far-sighted. This is not at all what some people think of as an expedient measure, but the correct application of revolutionary dialectics in socialist construction, and a long-term strategic policy of our country's socialist construction. We have relied on this policy to achieve two consecutive years of great leaps forward, and in the future, we will continue to rely on this policy to achieve continuous leaps forward throughout the 1960s.

Many people believe that the "small modern groups" can do more and do it faster. But can the "small modern groups" do it well and save money? Before last year, a few people's thinking had not been clarified on this point. They only saw that some "small modern groups" had relatively high product costs, unstable product quality, and relatively large raw material consumption in the early stages of their establishment, and believed that these were not as good as modern large-scale enterprises. Therefore, they always felt that the "small modern groups" leg was shorter and softer, in a word, they looked down on it.

Is this the case? Of course not. If we do not use a metaphysical point of view and examine the "small modern groups" in isolation from a certain historical background, we will come to conclusions completely different from the views of some of the people mentioned above. The question of whether the "small modern groups" can do it well and save money has also been answered by the facts of 1959. Let us take the iron and steel industry, which was the first to transition to "small modern groups," as an example. At the beginning of last year, each cubic meter of small blast furnace could only produce an average of 0.6 tons of iron per day and night; by December, the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces nationwide had increased to one ton. At the beginning of the year, the average utilization coefficient of small converters was less than ten tons; by December, many provinces had exceeded fourteen tons, and some enterprises had reached more than twenty tons. By the end of last year, the average cost of pig iron from small blast furnaces nationwide had decreased by about 25% compared with the previous year. In the first quarter of last year, the qualification rate of pig iron nationwide was still relatively low, but by October, the average qualification rate of iron produced by small blast furnaces in many provinces had increased to more than 90%. In just one year, various technical and economic indicators have doubled, how can this not be considered a miracle? What's more, in 1959, many advanced regions and enterprises had already used their actual achievements to show people how high a level the "small modern groups" could reach. For example, for the utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces, the average utilization coefficient of dozens or hundreds of furnace groups in many advanced regions reached more than two tons. The average utilization coefficient of Anhui Ma'anshan Red Flag No. 2 small blast furnace reached more than four tons in November last year, and the quality reached 100%. The average monthly utilization coefficient of Qingdao's small converters reached 34 tons, and several kinds of low-alloy steel were produced. In terms of cost, Yunnan Province has reduced the cost of pig iron for all small blast furnaces to below 180 yuan. The cost of each ton of pig iron at the Yuejin No. 1 small blast furnace of Sichuan Wanfu Iron and Steel Plant was only more than 74 yuan, which is lower than the cost of pig iron for all large and medium-sized blast furnaces in the country. The only conclusion is that "small modern groups" can completely do more, faster, better, and more economically.

Now our task is, on the basis of the victories already achieved, to greatly improve the "small modern groups" and climb to a new peak. In 1960, the new goals for the "small modern groups" are: in industries where "small modern groups" have not developed enough in the past two years, such as the non-ferrous metal industry, chemical industry, petroleum industry, power industry, etc., it is necessary to actively develop and build "small modern groups"; in industrial sectors such as iron and steel and coal, where "small modern groups" have already developed considerably, in addition to necessary development and new construction, special attention needs to be paid to improving and increasing the production of existing enterprises to ensure this year's continued leap forward. "Small modern groups" enterprises must further universally improve product quality, further universally reduce costs and raw material consumption, and improve the recovery rate and yield rate of mineral resources and raw materials, striving to catch up with the level of modern large-scale enterprises. It is necessary to increase the variety of products, for example, small blast furnaces must produce foundry pig iron, converter steelmaking pig iron, and manganese iron; small converters must produce a variety of steels, such as ball bearing steel, silicon steel, etc.; simple coke ovens must develop the comprehensive utilization of coal. All small coking plants, small oil refineries, and small chemical plants must strive to increase more product varieties. All "small modern groups" enterprises must strive to improve labor productivity, not only to achieve increased production without increasing manpower, but also to achieve increased production with reduced manpower, and to draw manpower to support new enterprises and agriculture.

How to achieve this goal? The most important thing is to rely on the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution in the "small modern groups" enterprises. It is necessary to mobilize the masses to first carry out tool reforms on a large scale and mechanize and semi-mechanize in those links where labor is the most arduous and the most manpower is used. In particular, the mining and transportation departments must vigorously mobilize the masses to create and promote simple rock drills, crushers, coal washing machines, mineral processing machines, and winches, etc., and use cableways, trolleys, light rails, and wooden rails, etc. to replace carrying on shoulders and backs. In this way, we can provide sufficient coal, coke, and ore to the thousands of small blast furnaces built in 1959 without increasing manpower, fully exploit their production capacity, further reduce the cost of pig iron and steel, and further improve the quality of coke and pig iron. In the "small modern groups" of other industries, the acquisition and processing of raw materials, as well as internal and external transportation, are generally relatively weak links at present. It is necessary to carry out technical innovation on a large scale to strengthen these weak links, so that the front, back, left, and right of the "small modern groups" are filled and patched up, and promote the overall leap forward of the "small modern groups."

In order to achieve this goal, it is also necessary to widely promote the rich advanced experience that was successfully created last year in all "small modern groups" enterprises. In 1959, almost every industry's "small modern groups" set up their own pacesetters, and advanced tools, equipment, and operating techniques appeared in almost every process. Last year, the central industrial departments and various provinces and cities all made more systematic summaries of these advanced experiences. Various departments and regions used many methods such as on-site meetings, mobile performances, and regular evaluations to achieve great results in the work of promoting advanced experience. This year, we must continue to use these effective methods to do a better job of the mass movement to promote advanced experience.

There are even higher demands placed on the broad masses of workers in the "small modern groups" enterprises. That is, not only to catch up with the level of modern large-scale enterprises in terms of production and economy, but also to set up lofty ambitions and boldly create new experiences in technology, and to serve as pioneers for the technical innovation of modern large-scale enterprises. The equipment of the "small modern groups" is small, and it is relatively easy to manufacture, so it has more superior conditions for conducting new experiments than the "large modern groups." Many facts in 1959 have proved that the "small modern groups" can undertake this glorious task. For example, the utilization coefficient of large blast furnaces reaching more than two tons is a rare level in the world, but last year, some small blast furnaces had an average monthly utilization coefficient of about four tons. The most fundamental reason is that these "small modern groups" dared to break superstitions, were not bound by old rules and regulations or technical regulations, dared to think, dared to speak, and dared to do, and were brave enough to move forward. Therefore, it created experiences that are not only valuable for improving the efficiency of small blast furnaces, but also of great significance for improving the production of large blast furnaces. For example, why can Qingdao's small converters achieve an astonishing utilization coefficient of 34 tons? It is because they created advanced operating methods. By using this method, the blowing time is greatly shortened, the output can be increased sharply by 30%, the quality of the steel is greatly improved, and conditions are created for direct smelting of high-quality steel by converters. Now the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has decided to promote their experience in large converters across the country. These examples show that the "small modern groups" can not only catch up with the "large modern groups," but also have the potential to become an important force in promoting and driving the "large modern groups" forward; the "small modern groups" can not only complete their share of the task in the cause of socialist construction in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, but also climb technical peaks and be the vanguard of the great technical revolution. Therefore, we hope that the comrades and comrades of the "small modern groups" enterprises will continue to carry forward the communist style of daring to think and daring to do in this new year, and constantly create new miracles in technology.

Comrades on the "small modern groups" front, advance victoriously! Let the development of the "small modern groups" write a more brilliant page in the history of our country's socialist construction in 1960!

    “小洋群”乘胜前进
    1959年，“小洋群”在我国社会主义建设的历史上写下了崭新的篇章。全国生铁的总产量中，仅地方企业的中小高炉所生产的生铁就占二分之一以上；钢的总产量中，中小转炉生产的占三分之一以上；铁矿石，中小型矿山生产的占全部产量的一半左右；煤，小型煤矿生产的占全部产量的五分之一左右；小水泥厂生产的水泥占全部产量的七分之一左右；四分之三以上的焦炭是由简易焦炉和土焦炉生产的；1959年，“小洋群”已经在国民经济大跃进中占据了一个举足轻重的位置。
    1959年“小洋群”企业在国民经济中所起的巨大作用，再一次证明了党中央和毛泽东同志的“两条腿走路”的方针，是使我国社会主义建设事业取得大跃进速度的唯一正确的方针。在总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针指导下，我国的工业、农业、交通运输业以及其他经济文化事业的发展速度，提到了比第一个五年计划时期高出一倍的水平上。这是一个伟大的革命创造。拿工业来说，近百年来，资本主义国家工业每年的平均增长速度，一般是3％到5％左右，其中发展最快的是第二次世界大战时期的美国。从1939年到1943年这四年中，由于当时极为特殊的条件，美国每年工业的增长速度曾经达到22％。但是，1958和1959两年，我国工业的发展速度，却远远超过了这个水平，分别达到了66．2％和39．3％。这个事实说明，无论从理论上或是实践上，党的“两条腿走路”的方针，都是一个有伟大历史意义的革命创造。
    1960年，“小洋群”要在现有的基础上再大大地向前跨进一步。我们要在全国所有的“小洋群”企业中展开一个大规模的技术革新和技术革命运动，把“小洋群”提高到一个新的更高的水平。
    我们是不断革命论者，对待革命，是这样；对待建设，也是这样。执行“两条腿走路”的方针，在我们，是一个不断创造、不断发展、不断提高的过程。“洋”和“土”、“大”和“小”的标准，是相对的。今天看来是土的，明天就可能转化成为洋的；今天看来是小的，明天就可能发展成大的。1958年我国在全民大办钢铁的群众运动中诞生的小土炉，不就是因为它的土和小而被有些人看不起吗？但是，它却有巨大的生命力。遍地开花、红光万里的小土炉，仅仅用了一年的时间，就在全国范围内完成了到“小洋群”的过渡，一部分“小洋群”甚至变成了“中洋群”。这样，我们就在1959年一年之中使洋钢的产量增长了60％以上，并且为1960年的继续跃进准备了充足的设备能力。用两条腿走路，洋土并举，土法上马、从土到洋、从小到大，既脚踏实地，又高瞻远瞩。这完全不像某些人所设想的那样是什么权宜之计，而是革命辩证法在社会主义建设中的正确运用，是我国社会主义建设的一个长远的战略方针。我们依靠这个方针取得了连续两年的大跃进，今后，我们还要依靠这个方针取得整个六十年代的连续跃进。
    “小洋群”能够做到多、做到快，这是许多人都相信的。但是，“小洋群”能不能做到好和省呢？这一点，在去年以前，还有少数人的思想没有得到澄清。他们只看到，某些“小洋群”在初创时期产品成本还比较高，产品质量还不够稳定，原材料消耗还比较多，认为这些都不如现代化的大型企业。因此，他们总觉得“小洋群”这条腿要短一些，软一些，一句话，就是看不起。
    事实是不是这样呢？当然不是。如果不是用形而上学的观点，离开一定的历史背景来孤立地考察“小洋群”，那么就会得出同上述一些人的看法完全不同的结论。“小洋群”能不能做到好和省的问题，也已经为1959年的事实所回答了。让我们举最早过渡到“小洋群”的钢铁工业来做例子吧。去年年初，小高炉每一立方米的容积每一昼夜平均只能生产零点六吨铁；到12月，全国小高炉的平均利用系数已经提高到一吨。年初，小转炉的平均利用系数不到十吨；到12月，许多省已经超过了十四吨，有些企业已达到二十吨以上。到去年年底全国小高炉生铁成本平均比上年降低了25％左右。去年第一季度，全国生铁的合格率还比较低，到10月份许多省小高炉产铁的合格率就平均提高到了90％以上。在短短的一年中，各项技术经济指标成倍地提高，这怎能不算是个奇迹呢。何况，1959年中，许多先进的地区和企业，已经用他们的实际成绩，向人们揭示了“小洋群”能够达到多么高的水平。例如，小高炉的利用系数，许多先进地区几十座、成百座的炉群，平均利用系数达到了两吨以上。安徽马鞍山红旗二号小高炉，去年11月份的平均利用系数达到了四吨以上，质量达到百分之百。青岛的小转炉月平均利用系数达到三十四吨，并炼出了好几种低合金钢。在成本方面，云南省已做到全部小高炉的生铁成本降到一百八十元以下。四川万福钢铁厂跃进号小高炉，每吨生铁成本只有七十四元多，比全国所有大中型高炉的生铁成本都低。结论只能是这样，“小洋群”完全可以做到多快好省。
    现在我们的任务是，在已经取得的胜利的基础上，把“小洋群”再大大提高一步，攀登上一个新的高峰。1960年，“小洋群”新的奋斗目标是：在过去两年中“小洋群”还发展得不够多的行业，如有色金属工业、化学工业、石油工业、电力工业等等，需要积极地发展建设“小洋群”，在“小洋群”已有相当发展的钢铁、煤炭等工业部门，除了必要的发展、新建以外，需要特别注意改进和提高现有企业的生产来保证今年的继续跃进。“小洋群”企业要进一步普遍提高产品质量，要进一步普遍降低成本和原材料消耗，要提高矿产资源和原料的回采率和收得率，力争赶上现代化大企业的水平。要增加产品的品种，例如，小高炉要生产铸造生铁、转炉炼钢生铁和锰铁；小转炉要生产多种钢，如滚珠钢、矽钢等等；简易焦炉要发展煤炭的综合利用。一切小炼焦厂、小石油厂、小化工厂，都要努力增加更多的产品品种。所有的“小洋群”企业都要努力提高劳动生产率，不但要做到增产不增人，而且要做到增产减人，抽出人力来支援新建企业和农业。
    怎样达到这个目标呢？最主要的是依靠“小洋群”企业开展技术革新和技术革命的群众运动。要发动群众首先在那些劳动最繁重、使用人力最多的环节中，大搞工具改革，大搞机械化和半机械化。特别是矿山和运输部门，要大力发动群众，创造和推广简易的凿岩机、破碎机、洗煤机、选矿机和卷扬机等等，要用索道、滑车、轻便铁轨和木轨等等来代替肩挑人背。这样，我们就可以在不增加人力的条件下，使1959年建成的几千座小高炉得到充足的煤、焦炭和矿石，充分发挥它们的生产能力，进一步降低生铁和钢的成本，进一步提高焦炭和生铁的质量。在其他行业的“小洋群”中，原料的取得和处理，以及厂内厂外运输，一般也都是当前比较薄弱的环节。必需大搞技术革新，加强这些薄弱环节，使“小洋群”的前后左右填平补齐，促使“小洋群”全面跃进。
    为了达到这个目标，还需要在所有的“小洋群”企业中广泛推行去年创造成功的丰富的先进经验。1959年，几乎每一个行业的“小洋群”都树起了自己的标兵，几乎每一道工序都出现了先进的工具设备和操作技术。去年，中央各工业部门、各省市对这些先进经验大都作了比较系统的总结。各个部门和各个地区运用现场会议，巡回表演、定期评比等许多办法，使推广先进经验的工作取得了很大的成绩。今年要继续使用这些行之有效的办法，把推广先进经验的群众运动做得更好。
    摆在“小洋群”企业广大职工面前的，还有更高的要求。这就是，不仅在生产上、经济上赶上现代化大企业的水平，而且要立下雄心壮志，在技术上大胆创造新的经验，为现代化大企业革新技术打前阵，作开路先锋。“小洋群”的设备小，制作比较容易，进行新的试验比“大洋群”有更为优异的条件。1959年已经有不少事实证明“小洋群”可以担负起这个光荣的任务。例如，大高炉的利用系数达到二吨以上，就是世界上少有的水平了，但是，去年有一些小高炉，月平均利用系数竟达到四吨左右。最基本的原因，就是因为这些“小洋群”敢于破除迷信，不被旧的规章制度或技术条例束缚，敢想敢说敢做，勇于前进。因而它创造出了不仅对提高小高炉效率有价值的经验，而且对于提高大高炉生产有极为重大意义的经验。再如，青岛的小转炉为什么能够使利用系数达到三十四吨的惊人水平呢？就是因为他们创造了先进的操作方法。采用这种方法，吹炼时间大为缩短，产量可以猛增30％，钢的质量大大提高，并为转炉直接冶炼优质钢创造了条件。现在冶金工业部已经决定要在全国的大型转炉上推广他们的经验。这些例子说明，“小洋群”不但可以赶上“大洋群”，而且有可能成为促进和推动“大洋群”前进的一个重要力量；“小洋群”不但可以多快好省地在社会主义建设事业中完成自己的一份任务，而且可以攀登技术高峰，作伟大的技术革命的急先锋。因此，我们希望“小洋群”企业中的职工同志们，在这新的一年里继续发扬敢想敢干的共产主义风格，不断地在技术上创造新的奇迹。
    “小洋群”战线上的全体同志们，乘胜前进！让1960年我国社会主义建设历史上写上“小洋群”发展的更加辉煌的一页！
