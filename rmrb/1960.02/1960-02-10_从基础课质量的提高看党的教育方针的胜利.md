Since the implementation of the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and education combined with productive labor," two years have passed. The experience of the past two years has proven that this is a completely correct Marxist-Leninist educational policy. The implementation of this policy has resulted in an overall leap forward in school work.

The great leap forward in school work is prominently manifested in the rapid improvement of teaching quality, and the improvement of teaching quality is particularly prominent in the great improvement of basic course quality. This is because basic courses teach the basic knowledge that a college student must possess, and the improvement of basic course quality reflects the improvement of teaching quality.

Since the implementation of the Party's educational policy, basic courses have become even more important due to the successive establishment of new majors and the extensive and in-depth development of scientific research, which have placed higher and more demands on basic courses. This is primarily reflected in the increase in new courses and class hours, the enrichment of the content of teaching syllabuses, and the strengthening of experimental courses. Taking Tsinghua University as an example, since the Great Leap Forward, due to the needs of new majors, the five teaching and research groups of mathematics, physics, chemistry, theoretical mechanics, and mechanics of materials have offered eighteen new courses such as program design, quantum electrodynamics, and isotope protection and application. The class hours of basic courses have also greatly increased. The revised teaching syllabus, according to the requirements of different majors, has added a lot of new content, including basic theory and modern science and technology knowledge; for example, higher mathematics has added mathematical physics equations and probability theory. Some of the original parts have been strengthened due to the needs of professional courses, such as general physics adding semiconductors, ultrasonics, atomic physics, and nuclear physics, mathematics strengthening approximate calculations, theoretical mechanics strengthening vibration, and experimental stress analysis in mechanics of materials expanding from a small section to a chapter. Experimental courses have also greatly developed. Taking physics experiments as an example, only fifty could be offered more than two years ago, but now it has increased to one hundred. All of these powerfully illustrate that the implementation of the Party's educational policy has not only not neglected basic courses or belittled theory, but on the contrary, has placed higher demands on basic courses, and the role of basic courses has become more prominent.

The improvement of basic course quality is not only reflected in these aspects, but more importantly, basic courses have begun to undergo qualitative changes. In the professional field of basic courses, the bourgeois worldview is hidden. It is the most stubborn stronghold of bourgeois academic thought. Some teachers, while teaching natural science content, sell a large amount of bourgeois idealistic and metaphysical goods, promoting the bourgeois worldview of theory divorced from practice, science divorced from production, and scientists being above all else, which seriously affects the teaching quality of basic courses and directly affects students' outlook on life and world view. The implementation of the Party's educational policy has fundamentally changed this situation. In the field of basic courses, dialectical materialism has replaced idealism and metaphysics, and the principle of combining theory with practice has replaced the situation of theory divorced from practice, abstractly playing with concepts, and deducing mathematical formulas. Taking Tsinghua University as an example, in order to correctly handle the relationship between politics and profession, theory and practice, the teaching and research groups of mathematics, physics, chemistry, theoretical mechanics, and mechanics of materials have conducted 103 special research discussions and held more than 230 discussion meetings in the past two years. These topics include the following: 1. Research on the basic concepts, principles, and theories in various sciences. This research has changed the past formalistic view of being divorced from reality and one-sidedly pursuing logical connections and mathematical relationships, and studies how to start from reality, analyze the actual content reflected by concepts and principles, and their guiding role for practical problems. 2. Research on the connections between various phenomena and laws of motion. This research has changed the past way of understanding natural phenomena statically and in isolation, but instead studies the connections between them, deepening the understanding of the comprehensive unity of the material world. 3. Research on the history of scientific development and the role of scientists. This research has changed the past historical idealist way of explaining the history of scientific development and exaggerating the role of scientists; instead, it attempts to explain the history of scientific development from the perspective of historical materialism and correctly explain the relationship between science and production, theory and practice, and scientists and the working masses. Of course, this work is only the beginning. There are still many shortcomings and mistakes, but due to these improvements in theoretical teaching, the quality has been significantly improved. It should be particularly pointed out that teachers' participation in productive labor also helps to improve the quality of basic course teaching. Because after teachers participate in productive labor, they change the past situation of knowing nothing about production, and their practical production knowledge is greatly increased, which creates favorable conditions for implementing the principle of close integration of theory and practice in teaching. At the same time, it also helps them to understand the theory they have learned more thoroughly from practice and improves their professional level. Participation in productive labor has played a major role in changing their bourgeois worldview. For example, a young teacher in the physics teaching and research group of Tsinghua University consistently believed that he was "material for studying physics" before the anti-Rightist movement. He always got 100 points in all theoretical courses and 60 points in labor courses. He was determined to devote his life to the research of abstract theory and disdained any practical work. He gained a lot from participating in the establishment of the laboratory in the past two years. He said: "During the great debate on teaching, I only theoretically realized that theory must be linked to practice and that production promotes science. However, the complete solution to this problem was still in a year of labor practice, and I deeply realized that people's subjective ideas must hit a wall if they do not conform to the laws of the objective world. In the past, I regretted why I was not born ten years earlier, which led to the loss of the opportunity to go abroad for further study. Now I am very fortunate to be able to live in this era of the Great Leap Forward and be able to follow the Party to communism. What I still regret is that I did not contribute all my talents to the Party earlier. I will always be a docile tool of the Party in the future!!" Now he has not only become an active member of the laboratory, but also a major technical backbone in the teaching and research group. All of this determines that the quality of basic courses will inevitably be further improved.

Some people once doubted the correctness of the Party's educational policy. They first doubted whether the implementation of this policy would reduce the quality of teaching, especially whether it would reduce the quality of basic course teaching. Now the facts have given a powerful answer, and this doubt is fundamentally wrong. The result of implementing the Party's educational policy is not only not to reduce the quality of teaching, but to fundamentally improve the quality of teaching. The great improvement of the quality of basic course teaching is the best proof.

    从基础课质量的提高看党的教育方针的胜利
    李卓宝
    党的“教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针贯彻以来，已经两年了。两年来的经验证明，这是一条完全正确的马克思列宁主义的教育方针，这条方针执行的结果，使学校工作获得了全面的大跃进。
    学校工作的大跃进突出地表现在教学质量的飞快提高上，教学质量的提高又突出基础课质量的大大提高，因为基础课所教授的是一个大学生所必须具备的基础知识，基础课质量的提高，正反映着教学质量的提高。
    党的教育方针贯彻以后，由于新专业的相继成立，科学研究广泛而深入的开展，对基础课提出了更高更多的要求，基础课就显得更加重要。这首先表现在新课程和学时的增加，教学大纲内容的充实，和实验课的加强上。以清华大学为例，大跃进以来由于新专业的需要，数学、物理、化学、理论力学、材料力学等五个教研组开出了程序设计、量子电动力学、同位素的防护及应用等十八门新的课程，基础课的学时，也大大地增加了。根据专业不同的要求修订后的教学大纲增加了不少新内容。其中包括基本理论与近代科学技术知识；如高等数学增加了数理方程、概率论。有些原有的部分，由于专业课的需要，比过去加强了，如普通物理增加了半导体、超声波、原子物理及原子核物理，数学加强了近似计算，理论力学加强了振动，材料力学的实验应力分析由一小节扩充成为一章。实验课也有了很大的发展。就以物理实验为例，两年多以前只能开出五十个，现在已增加到一百个。这些都有力地说明了贯彻党的教育方针以后不但没有忽视基础课，贬低理论，相反地对基础课提出了更高的要求，基础课的作用更为突出了。
    基础课质量的提高不仅仅表现在以上这些方面，更重要的是基础课开始起了质的变化。在基础课的业务领域里，隐藏着资产阶级世界观。它是资产阶级学术思想最顽强的一个阵地，有的教师虽然讲的是自然科学的内容，却大量的贩卖着资产阶级唯心主义形而上学的货色，宣扬理论脱离实际，科学脱离生产，科学家高于一切的资产阶级世界观，严重地影响了基础课的教学质量，并且直接影响了同学的人生观和世界观。党的教育方针的贯彻，使这种状况有了根本的改变，在基础课的领域内，辩证唯物主义代替了唯心主义和形而上学，理论和实际相结合的原则，代替了理论脱离实际，抽象玩弄概念和演绎数学公式的状况。拿清华大学来说，为了正确地处理政治和业务，理论和实际的关系，两年来，数学、物理、化学、理论力学、材料力学各教研组曾进行了一百零三个专题的研究讨论，举行了二百三十多次讨论会。这些专题包括如下的内容：一、对各门科学中的基本概念、原理、理论的研究。这种研究改变了过去脱离实际，片面追求逻辑联系和数学关系的形式主义观点，研究如何从实际出发，分析概念和原理所反映的实际内容及其对实际问题的指导作用。二、对各种现象、运动规律之间的联系的研究。这种研究改变了过去那种静止地孤立地去了解自然现象，而是研究它们之间的联系，加深对物质世界全面统一的了解。三、对科学发展史，科学家作用的研究。这种研究改变了过去那种历史唯心主义地讲述科学发展史，夸大科学家的作用；而是尝试以历史唯物主义的观点来阐述科学发展史，正确地讲解科学与生产，理论与实际，科学家与劳动群众的关系。当然这些工作还只是开始。缺点错误仍是不少的，但由于理论教学作了这些改进，质量就显著地提高了。特别应该提出的是教师参加生产劳动，也有助于基础课教学质量的提高。因为教师参加生产劳动后，改变了过去那种对生产一无所知的情况，实际生产知识大大增加了，这就为在教学中贯彻理论和实际密切结合的原则创造了有利条件。同时也帮助了他们从实践中更透彻地理解自己所学的理论，提高了业务水平。参加生产劳动对改变他们的资产阶级世界观起了重大作用。例如清华大学物理教研组有一位年青教师，反右以前一贯认为自己是“学物理的料”，从小所有理论课都是一百分，劳作课就得六十分。他立志要毕生从事于抽象理论的研究，不屑作任何实际工作。两年来参加了建立实验室的工作，收获很大，他说：“在教学大辩论时，只是从理论上认识到理论必须联系实际，生产推动科学。但是彻底解决这一问题还是在一年的劳动实践中，深刻体会到人们的主观想法，如果不符合客观世界的规律就一定要碰钉子。过去很遗憾自己为甚么不早生十年，以致失去了出国镀金的机会，现在则很庆幸自己能够生活在这大跃进的年代里，能够跟着党走向共产主义，现在还感到遗憾的是过去没有很早地把自己的全部才能贡献给党，今后要永远做党的驯服工具！！”现在他不仅已经成为实验室的积极分子，而且是教研组内主要的技术骨干。所有这一切，就决定了基础课的质量必然要进一步提高。
    有些人，曾经怀疑党的教育方针的正确性，他们首先就怀疑贯彻执行这一方针会不会降低教学质量，尤其是怀疑会不会降低基础课的教学质量。现在事实已经作了有力的答复，这种怀疑是根本上错了，贯彻党的教育方针的结果，不但没有降低教学质量，而是从根本上提高了教学质量，基础课教学质量的大大提高就是最好的证明。
