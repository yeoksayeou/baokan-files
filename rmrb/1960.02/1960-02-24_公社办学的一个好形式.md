    A Good Form of School Management by Communes
    Qin Nan
    The Fucheng People's Commune in Lingchuan County, Shanxi Province, has established ten types of spare-time schools based on different production organizations (various factories, farms, and specialized fields), achieving great results.
    The production of people's communes is developing in many ways. At the same time, agricultural technological transformation is rapidly advancing. This requires various agricultural technical personnel. In addition to relying on full-time agricultural technical schools and part-time agricultural middle schools for training, a larger number rely on various spare-time schools for training. It is very necessary and effective for various specialized fields (factories) of people's communes to run various single-subject spare-time schools. After the Fucheng People's Commune established various spare-time schools, it completed the task of eliminating illiteracy in three months, popularized spare-time elementary education, and also trained 850 various technical personnel, thus making significant achievements in production.
    Production and learning are fundamentally unified and complementary. Human knowledge comes from production practice; learning this knowledge is for going into production practice. In the old society, the working people who had production experience and practical knowledge were oppressed and lacked culture, so their knowledge mostly remained at a lower level. They could not use science to summarize their experience and knowledge. The intellectuals who mastered culture were far removed from the working people, and their knowledge often could not solve practical problems. The separation of the two made the development of culture and science very slow, and there was little progress in production technology. In socialist society, especially under the guidance of the policy of combining education with productive labor, both are developing and improving rapidly.
    The current excellent situation of agricultural technological transformation requires a cultural upsurge to match it. Chairman Mao once said that with the high tide of economic construction, there will inevitably be a high tide of cultural construction. The Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party put forward the technological revolution and the cultural revolution. Millions of people responded to the Party's call and have continuously achieved brilliant successes on the production and cultural fronts. The huge wave of technological innovation and technological revolution is sweeping the country, and the high tide of the cultural revolution is about to arrive, once again proving the greatness and correctness of Chairman Mao's foresight. The benefits of the Fucheng People's Commune running schools through its fields show that this form can promote the development of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution. People's communes in various places can establish various spare-time schools according to specific conditions, so that the high tide of the cultural revolution can surge in the new socialist countryside of the motherland.

    公社办学的一个好形式
    秦南
    山西陵川县附城人民公社，按不同生产组织（各种工厂、农场和专业场），办了十类业余学校，取得了很大成效。
    人民公社的生产正向多方面发展。同时，农业技术改造正在迅速前进。这就需要各种农业技术人材。这些人材除了依靠全日制的农业技术学校和半日制的农业中学来培养外，更大量的是依靠各种业余学校来培养。人民公社各个专业场（厂）举办各种单科性的业余学校，是很必要的，也是很解决问题的。附城人民公社办了各种业余学校后，在三个月里就完成了扫除文盲的任务，普及了业余初等教育，还培养了各种技术人材八百五十名，从而使生产也有了显著的成绩。
    生产和学习，从根本上说，是统一的，是相辅相成的。人类的知识，是从生产实践中来的；学习这些知识，是为了到生产实践中去。在旧社会中，有了生产经验、实践知识的劳动人民，却因为受压迫，没有文化，他们的知识，大都停留在较低的水平上，他们不可能运用科学去总结他们的经验和知识；而掌握文化的知识分子，又远远脱离劳动人民，他们的知识常常不能解决实际问题。两者互相脱离，就使文化科学的发展非常迟缓，而在生产技术方面也很少进展。在社会主义社会里，特别是在教育与生产劳动相结合的方针贯彻下，两者都在飞速地发展和提高。
    目前农业技术改造的大好形势，就要求有一个文化高潮与之相适应。毛主席曾经讲过，随着经济建设的高潮而来的，必然是文化建设的高潮。党的八大二次会议提出了技术革命和文化革命。千百万人民群众响应着党的号召，在生产战线和文化战线上，已经连续取得了光辉灿烂的成绩，技术革新和技术革命的巨浪正在席卷全国，文化革命的高潮行将到来，再一次证明毛主席预见的伟大和正确。附城人民公社以场办校的好处说明，这种形式可以促进技术革命和文化革命的开展。各地人民公社可以根据具体条件，创办各种业余学校，让文化革命的高潮澎湃在社会主义祖国的新农村。
