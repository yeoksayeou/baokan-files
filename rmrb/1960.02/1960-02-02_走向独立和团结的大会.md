    A Congress Moving Towards Independence and Unity
    The Second All-African Peoples Conference held in Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, from January 25th, concluded successfully on January 31st. During the short period of seven days, more than 140 representatives from 50 political parties and mass organizations from 30 African countries gathered to exchange views on the great cause of independence and unity of the African people. The conference finally adopted the "General Policy on the Struggle for African Independence," "On the Issue of African Economic Development," "On the Issue of African Unity," "On the Algerian Question," and a series of resolutions on Nyasaland and Rhodesia, the Congo, Cameroon, South Africa, Portuguese Africa, Kenya, Tanganyika, the "French Community" and the Ivory Coast, Zanzibar, and other issues. The conference also passed a resolution on the issue of African trade union organizations. All this shows that the Second All-African Peoples Conference has achieved significant accomplishments, and it has sounded the battle horn for the further destruction of the colonial system by all African people in 1960.
    In recent years, especially since the Asian-African Peoples Solidarity Conference in Cairo and the All-African Peoples Conference in Accra, the situation in Africa has undergone dramatic changes. Just over a year ago, the national independence struggles of the vast black African colonies south of the equator were only trickles, but now a massive and magnificent national independence movement has emerged. This year, in addition to the French colonialists being forced to recognize Cameroon's independence status on January 1st, French Togoland, Italian Somaliland, and Nigeria, Britain's largest colony in Africa, will successively declare independence in April, July, and October. According to recent news, after effectively resisting the fake elections fabricated by the Belgian colonialists and rejecting the so-called "independence in stages" trick, the Congolese people have forced the Belgian colonialists to make concessions and agree to declare the Congo's independence on June 30th. The people of Nyasaland, Uganda, Kenya, and other African colonies are also launching further struggles for national independence and freedom at the beginning of the new year. The Second All-African Peoples Conference correctly assessed the current favorable situation in Africa. The conference resolution pointed out that "the movement for African independence, freedom, and unity is irresistible" and "calls on the people of all African countries to strengthen the struggle for independence," demanding that "the people of all African countries take immediate and unconditional action, demanding the complete withdrawal of all foreign troops stationed in Africa for the purpose of aggression and oppression; and declare that in order to more effectively resist the collusion of the imperialists and to rapidly liberate the people of all dependent countries from foreign oppression, it is absolutely necessary to unite and unite the forces of all Africans." There is no doubt that the hundreds of millions of people in the African colonies will be inspired by the battle call issued by the Second All-African Peoples Conference and will bravely advance towards the road of independence.
    Enlightened African politicians have realized that in the current process of the continued development of the African national independence movement, it is necessary to distinguish between true independence and false independence, and to expose the various conspiracies and tricks of neocolonialism that the imperialists are playing in Africa. The Guinean delegation representative Diallo said at the conference: Neocolonialism is a threat to Africa. The imperialists find that they cannot stop the course of history and change the African people's determination for independence, so they are trying everything possible to make the African people give up their struggle. They are prepared to agree to "independence" in name. The resolution "General Policy on the Struggle for African Independence" adopted by the Second All-African Peoples Conference warmly appealed to the people of all African countries to be vigilant. People can clearly see that the British colonialists are currently carrying out hypocritical tricks such as so-called "constitutional reforms" in various East African countries, and the French colonialists continue to use tricks such as the "Community" to maintain their colonial rule in West Africa and Equatorial Africa. Even in Cameroon, although the French colonialists were forced to agree to its independence, this does not mean that the French colonialists are willing to give up their colonial rule over this country. The Paris "Figaro" has clearly declared: "It is still necessary for French troops to remain in Cameroon now," which is the true expression of the French colonialists' honeyed words and hidden daggers. The resolution of this All-African Peoples Conference on Cameroon correctly believes that the existing independence of Cameroon is "the result of the struggle of the Cameroonian people," and the resolution demands the immediate withdrawal of French troops; democracy and freedom should be restored and respected. This resolution will undoubtedly further encourage the Cameroonian people to continue to fight for the complete independence of their motherland.
    The Algerian question became an important topic of this All-African Peoples Conference, which shows the great concern of the people of all African countries for the Algerian national revolutionary struggle. The Algerian people's insistence on armed anti-French struggle is of extremely great significance to the entire African national independence movement. Now, in Africa, more and more people of African countries are embarking on the path pointed out by the Algerian people. As Guinean representative Touré Ismail said: "The Algerian national revolution is a living symbol of the struggle of the people of all African countries. In front of the whole world, the Algerian resistance, which is dealing with 600,000 armed (French) troops, is frustrating French imperialism."
    The development of the current situation has never been as favorable to the Algerian people and unfavorable to the French colonialists as it is now. The resolution on the Algerian issue adopted by the Second All-African Peoples Conference "condemns the French government's delaying tactics and the conspiracies and tricks aimed at continuing the war of aggression against the Algerian people." The All-African Peoples Conference recommends that all independent African countries recognize the Algerian government and calls for the organization of an African volunteer corps to support the Algerian people's struggle. This is a powerful support for the Algerian people. Algerian trade union representative Maschu said rightly on the podium of the conference: Colonialism is doomed to collapse. We are getting closer to our goal day by day.
    Through their own personal experience, the African people are increasingly feeling the serious threat of American neocolonialism to the African national independence movement. Félix Moumié, Chairman of the Cameroon People's Union, exposed the mask of "anti-colonialism" flaunted by American imperialism in his speech at the conference. He said: Although the United States makes some high-sounding statements, they are the head of neocolonialism. The United States uses the guise of anti-communism to cover up its economic plunder and bellicosity, and it is actively supporting the French imperialists' brutal war against the Cameroonian national movement. Similarly, on the Algerian issue, the sinister face of American neocolonialists is also clearly exposed. On the one hand, the United States is trying to squeeze out French influence in Algeria in order to replace France; but on the other hand, it is actively supporting the French colonialists' bloody massacres of the Algerian people militarily, financially, and politically. In a telegram to US President Eisenhower and the US Congress, this All-African Peoples Conference emphasized that US weapons are being used by French troops to massacre the Algerian people; the United States is providing France with military, economic, and diplomatic assistance to support France's war of aggression against Algeria. The telegram requested the US authorities to abandon this harmful policy and emphasized that "US support for French colonial policy has caused serious damage to the African people." This is another exposure of the neocolonialist crimes of the US ruling group by the African people.
    The Second All-African Peoples Conference fully embodies the increasingly strengthened unity of the people of all African countries in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism and for national independence. The various resolutions adopted by the conference show that the truth that "unity is strength" also shines on the people of all African countries who are fighting for independence and freedom
    The just struggles of the African people against imperialism and colonialism and for national independence have won the warm sympathy and support of all progressive mankind. In his congratulatory message to the Second All-African Peoples Conference, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai once again conveyed the heartfelt voice of the 600 million Chinese people to the African people. Premier Zhou said: "The Chinese people firmly stand on the side of the African people and vigorously support the African people's struggle for national independence until complete victory." The Chinese people firmly believe that although the African people may still encounter various difficulties in their advance, the day when the African national independence movement will achieve complete victory is getting closer and closer as human history steps into the 1960s.

### 走向独立和团结的大会

    走向独立和团结的大会
    在突尼斯首都举行的第二届全非人民大会从1月25日开始，已于1月31日胜利闭幕了。在短短的七天期间，非洲三十个国家五十个政党和群众团体的一百四十多名代表齐聚一堂，就非洲人民独立和团结的伟大事业交换了意见。大会最后通过了“关于争取非洲独立的总政策”、“关于非洲经济发展问题”、“关于非洲统一问题”、“关于阿尔及利亚问题”和有关尼亚萨兰和罗得西亚、刚果、喀麦隆、南非、葡属非洲、怯尼亚、坦噶尼喀、“法兰西共同体”和象牙海岸、桑给巴尔等问题的一系列决议。大会还就非洲工会组织的问题通过了决议。所有这些表明，第二届全非人民大会已经取得了重大的成就，它为1960年全非洲人民进一步摧毁殖民制度，吹起了战斗的号角。
    最近几年，特别是亚非人民团结大会开罗会议和全非人民大会阿克拉会议举行以来，非洲形势发生了急剧的变化。一年多以前，赤道以南的广大黑非洲殖民地人民的民族独立斗争还只是涓涓细流，而现在却出现了声势浩大、波澜壮阔的民族独立运动。今年除了1月1日法国殖民者已被迫承认喀麦隆的独立地位以外，在4月、7月和10月间法属多哥、意属索马里兰和英国在非洲最大的殖民地尼日利亚将要先后宣告独立。据最近消息，刚果人民在有效地抵制了比利时殖民者所制造的伪选和拒绝了所谓“分阶段独立”的骗局之后，已迫使比利时殖民者作出让步，同意刚果在6月30日宣布独立。尼亚萨兰、乌干达、怯尼亚和其它非洲殖民地的人民在新的一年开始的时候，也正为民族的独立和自由展开进一步的斗争。第二届全非人民大会正确地估计了非洲当前的有利形势。大会决议指出：“争取非洲独立、自由和统一运动是势不可挡的”，并且“号召非洲各国人民加强争取独立的斗争”，要求“非洲各国人民立即无条件地采取行动，要求旨在进行侵略和压迫的驻在非洲的外国军队全部撤退；并且宣布，为了更有效地抗击帝国主义者的勾结和迅速地把所有附属国的人民从外国压迫之下解放出来，绝对必须联合和团结全体非洲人的力量。”毫无疑问，非洲殖民地的亿万人民将要在第二届全非人民大会所发出的这个战斗号召的鼓舞下，向着独立的大道奋勇前进。
    非洲有见识的政治家已经认识到，在当前非洲民族独立运动继续发展过程中，必须辨清真独立和假独立的分野，揭穿帝国主义者正在非洲玩弄的新殖民主义的各种阴谋诡计。几内亚的代表团代表迪亚洛在大会上发言说：新殖民主义是对非洲的威胁。帝国主义者发现自己不能制止历史的进程和改变非洲人民的独立决心，因此想尽办法想使非洲人民放弃斗争。他们准备在名义上同意“独立”。第二届全非人民大会所通过的“关于争取非洲独立的总政策”的决议中热忱地呼吁非洲各国人民必须提高警惕。人们可以清楚地看到，英国殖民者目前正在东非各国进行着所谓“宪政改革”等的虚伪勾当，法国殖民者继续用“共同体”之类的骗局以维护其在西非和赤道非洲的殖民统治。即使在喀麦隆，虽然法国殖民者被迫同意了它的独立，但这也丝毫不等于法国殖民者甘心放弃对这个国家的殖民统治。巴黎“费加罗报”已经明白宣称：“法国军队留在喀麦隆现在还是必要的”，这就是法国殖民者口蜜腹剑的真情流露。本届全非人民大会关于喀麦隆的决议正确地认为，喀麦隆现有的独立是“喀麦隆人民斗争的结果”，决议要求立即撤退法国军队；民主和自由应当得到恢复和尊重。这个决议无疑地将进一步鼓舞喀麦隆人民继续为他们祖国的完全的独立而斗争。
    阿尔及利亚问题成为本届全非人民大会的一个重要议题，这表明非洲各国人民对阿尔及利亚民族革命斗争的重大关切。阿尔及利亚人民坚持反法武装斗争，对于整个非洲民族独立运动来说具有极其重大意义。现在在非洲，越来越多的非洲国家人民正在走上阿尔及利亚人民所指引的道路。正如几内亚的代表杜尔·伊斯梅尔所说：“阿尔及利亚的民族革命是非洲各国人民的斗争的活生生的象征。在全世界面前，对付着六十万武装到牙齿的（法国）军队的阿尔及利亚抗战正在挫败着法国帝国主义”。
    目前形势的发展，从来都没有像现在那样有利于阿尔及利亚人民，而不利于法国殖民者。第二届全非人民大会就阿尔及利亚问题通过的决议“谴责法国政府的拖延政策和旨在对阿尔及利亚人民继续进行侵略战争而玩弄的阴谋诡计。”全非人民大会建议所有独立的非洲国家承认阿尔及利亚政府，并且号召组织非洲志愿军军团支援阿尔及利亚人民的斗争。这是对于阿尔及利亚人民的有力的支持。阿尔及利亚工会代表马舒在大会的讲坛上说得对：殖民主义注定要垮台。我们正在一天一天地接近我们的目标。
    非洲人民通过自己切身的经验正日益感受到美国新殖民主义对于非洲民族独立运动的严重威胁。喀麦隆人民联盟主席费利克斯·穆米埃在大会的发言中揭穿了美国帝国主义所标榜的“反殖民主义”的假面具。他说：美国尽管冠冕堂皇发表一些声明，但是他们是新殖民主义的头子。美国用反共的外衣掩盖它的经济掠夺和好战性，它正在积极支持法帝国主义者对喀麦隆民族运动所进行的残酷战争。同样，在阿尔及利亚问题上，美国新殖民主义者的阴险面目也暴露得十分清楚。美国一方面力图在阿尔及利亚排挤法国的势力，以便取法国的地位而代之；但另一方面又积极在军事上、财政上和政治上支持法国殖民者对阿尔及利亚人民所进行的血腥屠杀。本届全非人民大会在致美国总统艾森豪威尔和美国国会的电文中强调说：美国武器正被法国军队用来屠杀阿尔及利亚人民；美国在军事经济和外交上给法国以援助，支持法国对阿尔及利亚的侵略战争。电文要求美国当局放弃这种有害的政策，并且强调指出，“美国对法国的殖民政策的支持，给非洲人民带来了严重的损害。”这是非洲人民对于美国统治集团的新殖民主义罪行的又一次揭发。
    第二届全非人民大会充分地体现了非洲各国人民在反对帝国主义、殖民主义，争取民族独立斗争中日益加强的团结。大会通过的各项决议表明，“团结就是力量”的真理同样照耀着正在为争取独立和自由而斗争的非洲各国人民。
    非洲人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义，争取民族独立的正义斗争已经赢得了全体进步人类的热烈同情和支持。我国周恩来总理在致第二届全非人民大会的贺电中再一次向非洲人民传达了六亿中国人民的心声。周总理说：“中国人民坚决地站在非洲人民一边，大力支持非洲人民的争取民族独立的斗争，直到取得完全的胜利”。中国人民坚定地相信，尽管非洲人民在前进中还可能遇到各种各样的困难，但是当人类历史跨进二十世纪六十年代的时候，非洲民族独立运动取得完全胜利的日子已经日益临近了。
