Stressing Both Large-Area Farmland and High-Yield Demonstration Plots
Guixi County Fully Prepares for Spring Plowing

(Our dispatch) Guixi County, Jiangxi Province, based on the requirements of the policy of "more variety, high yield, more harvest," has made early arrangements for various spring plowing preparations, resulting in a vigorous spring plowing preparation upsurge.

The county party committee inspection team recently inspected the county's spring plowing preparations and pointed out that the prominent feature of this year's work is that large-area farmland and high-yield demonstration plots are given equal importance; and the progress is extremely rapid and the quality is very good.

This year, Guixi County's communes have universally organized cadres and members to discuss how to better implement the policy of "more variety, high yield, more harvest." The county plans to expand early rice acreage to 400,000 mu, 40,000 mu more than last year; the average yield per mu will reach 500 jin, an increase of 43% over last year. Among them, 200,000 mu were designated as high-yield demonstration plots, with an average yield of 600 jin or more per mu. In addition, the masses will be mobilized to reclaim small wasteland plots and utilize scattered land to expand the planting of 20,000 mu of summer-harvested feed crops and melons and vegetables. After formulating the plan, the party organizations of the communes widely mobilized the masses to come up with ideas and find solutions, and launched a spring plowing preparation movement centered on water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation and production as early as possible. On the basis of completing the original water conservancy construction plan, various places have recently organized manpower to build and repair nearly a thousand small water conservancy projects beside the expanded fields, thus ensuring the needs of the county to expand the planting of 40,000 mu of early rice. Various places have also broadened the sources of fertilizer according to the needs of multiple plantings, and organized more than 20,000 laborers to climb mountains and wade through rivers to accumulate and produce farm manure; all of the county's original thousand or so indigenous fertilizer plants have also started production. At the same time, more than a thousand pig farms have been established beside the expanded fields to accumulate high-quality livestock manure. While vigorously mobilizing the masses to invent and create new tools, more than a thousand carpenters, blacksmiths, and basket weavers were organized to rush to manufacture and repair farm tools, striving to universally use advanced tools in every process from plowing to planting, and improve work efficiency, so as to solve the problem of labor shortage after implementing multiple plantings. In addition, preparations have also been made for seeds, seedling fields, and deep plowing.

While making spring plowing preparations for large-area farmland, the communes in Guixi County are actively making more adequate spring plowing preparations for high-yield demonstration plots. These fields have more water conservancy facilities, more fertile soil, and better sunshine, but because higher yields per unit area are required, they must be prepared with more fertilizer and water conservancy projects than ordinary fields, and require more meticulous cultivation. Therefore, all communes have organized professional teams for high-yield demonstration plots to be specifically responsible for preparing for spring plowing. After Shangqing Commune determined that 15% of farmland, namely 3,000 mu of farmland, as high-yield demonstration plots, the entire commune organized more than 500 party members, members of the Communist Youth League, old peasants, and commune members with rich production experience to form ten professional teams to specifically cultivate high-yield demonstration plots. To date, they have accumulated more than 90 million dan of fertilizer for these fields, an average of 300 dan per mu, which is 100 dan more than ordinary fields; more than 1,000 pieces of various advanced tools have been prepared, and other preparations such as tidying up seedling fields and deep plowing of soil have been completed. Now, all 200,000 mu of high-yield demonstration plots in the county have been marked with "high-yield signs," and there are more than a thousand professional teams specifically responsible for cultivation; the various materials prepared by the communes for these fields, calculated on an average per mu basis, are generally more than 20% more than those for large-area farmland.

    大面积农田和高额丰产田并重
    贵溪县全面进行春耕准备
    本报讯　江西省贵溪县根据多种、高产、多收方针的要求，及早安排了各项备耕工作，随着掀起了蓬蓬勃勃的备耕热潮。
    县委检查团最近检查了全县备耕情况后指出，今年备耕工作的突出特点是：大面积农田和高额丰产田同时并重；并且进度极快，质量很好。
    今年贵溪县各公社普遍组织了干部社员讨论怎样更好地贯彻多种高产多收的方针。全县计划早稻面积扩大到四十万亩，比去年多种四万亩；平均亩产量达到五百斤，比去年增长43％。其中确定高额丰产田二十万亩，平均亩产量达到六百斤以上。此外，还将发动群众开垦小块荒地和利用零星土地，扩种二万亩夏收饲料作物和瓜菜。在制定了计划以后，各公社党组织广泛发动群众出主意、想办法，及早开展了以水利兴修和积肥造肥为中心的备耕运动。各地在已完成原兴修水利计划的基础上，最近又组织人力在扩种的田旁突击新建和整修了近千座小型水利工程，因而保证了全县扩种四万亩早稻的需要。各地还根据多种的需要，广辟肥源，组织了两万多个劳力登山涉水，积造农家肥；全县原有的一千多个土化肥厂也全部开工生产。同时在扩种的田旁办起了一千多个养猪场，积造优质的畜肥。在大力发动群众发明创制新工具的同时，组织了一千多名木工铁工篾工赶制赶修农具，争取由耕到种的各个工序都普遍用上先进工具，提高工效，以解决实行多种后的劳力不足问题。此外，种子、秧田、深耕等也都进行了准备。
    在为大面积农田做好春耕准备的同时，贵溪县各公社积极为高额丰产田做好更加充分的春耕准备。这些田的水利设施较多，土质较肥，阳光较好，但是由于要求达到更高的单位面积产量，还必须比一般田准备更多一点的肥料和水利工程，耕作上要求更加精细。因此，各公社都组织了高额丰产田的专业队专门负责准备春耕。上清公社确定了15％农田，即三千亩农田为高额丰产田后，全社组织了五百多名党员、团员、老农和有丰富生产经验的社员，成立了十个专业队，专门耕种高额丰产田。至今，他们已为这些田积造了九千多万担肥料，平均每亩达三百担，比一般田多一百担；已准备了各种先进工具一千多件，同时已做好了整理秧田和深耕土壤等其他准备工作。现在全县二十万亩高额丰产田都已插上了丰产牌，有一千多个专业队专门负责耕作；各公社为这些田准备的各项物资，以每亩平均计算，一般比大面积农田多20％以上。
