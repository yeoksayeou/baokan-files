Xinhua News Agency, February 17th: Recently, the US ruling group has been intensifying its steps to plot the subversion of the Cuban government. From the actions of US officials and the pronouncements of US political figures and major newspapers, it can be seen that in Washington, the aggressive flames of destroying the Cuban revolution and subverting the Cuban government are more intense than ever before.

On February 13th, the very day that the Cuban government signed a trade agreement with the Soviet Union, the US Embassy in Cuba immediately issued an interventionist statement, threatening that the US would revise its policy of purchasing Cuban sugar based on the Soviet-Cuban trade agreement. On February 14th, the "New York Times" published an editorial threatening that this agreement would "cause those in the United States who advocate retaliation against Cuba to clench their fists."

According to US news agency reports, US authorities formally announced at the National Sugar Producers Conference convened last week that the US government has decided to request Congress to authorize the President to reduce sugar import quotas at any time.

The "Christian Science Monitor," in discussing this measure, pointed out, "This is placing something equivalent to a modern Marine Corps in the hands of the Commander-in-Chief, allowing him to use it at the most effective time."

Economic measures are accompanied by undisguised military intervention preparations. The US ruling group is plotting to seize the opportunity to use the "big stick" of armed intervention to strangle the Cuban revolution. Currently, large numbers of US armed forces are conducting threatening "exercises" against Cuba in the Caribbean Sea. Aircraft dispatched from US bases have repeatedly attacked Cuban territory, ignoring protests from the Cuban government. At the same time, rampant colonialist forces are creating "public opinion" in the United States, demanding a naked policy of military repression against Cuba.

Senator Smathers of Florida, notorious for advocating intervention in Cuba, clamored: "The time has come to adopt a comprehensive strategy in what we are prepared to do to Cuba." According to the "National Guardian" weekly of January 30th, many people in the US Congress and newspapers are clamoring for the "oldest method" - "mobilizing the Marine Corps" - to deal with Cuba.

The Washington "Evening Star" commented on January 29th, also advocating a "show of strength." The newspaper said that strong action against Cuba would be "welcomed." The "New York Post," in explaining the intention of the large-scale military exercises threatening Cuba, scheduled to be held by the US in Puerto Rico in March, said that the exercises would make it clear to Castro that "the United States has the ability to transport heavy troops and heavy war equipment to Cuba in a matter of hours."

Some American politicians and newspapers are trying their best to advocate the immediate use of the Pan-American instrument controlled by the United States - first and foremost the Organization of American States - to implement intervention in Cuba. Senator Hosmer announced that he would introduce a bill in Congress to "authorize the (Organization of) American States to take immediate individual or collective action."

However, many newspapers of the US ruling group, when talking about the US deployment to intervene in Cuba, cannot but take into account the aspect of the Latin American situation that is very unfavorable to the United States. They acknowledge that the Cuban revolution is deeply popular in Latin America and fear that if the United States does things too blatantly towards Cuba, it will be unanimously opposed by the Latin American people. Therefore, they advocate that while planning aggressive actions, they should superficially wave the banner of "non-interference" to麻痹 public opinion.

However, what US imperialism is currently doing to Cuba has long been familiar to people. The US "Worker's Weekly" pointed out that the danger of the US "interfering in Cuba in this way or that is greater than ever before." This conspiracy of the United States is increasingly being relentlessly exposed by the Cuban people and world public opinion. As the Cuban "Combate" pointed out, the Cuban people are constantly vigilant against this conspiracy. Peace-loving people all over the world are closely watching the US conspiracy to interfere in Cuba.

### 美国加紧策划颠覆古巴政府

    美国加紧策划颠覆古巴政府
    据新华社17日讯　最近以来，美国统治集团策划颠覆古巴政府的步骤日益加紧。从美国官方的行动以及美国政界人物和重要报刊的言论中可以看出，在华盛顿，破坏古巴革命、颠覆古巴政府的侵略毒焰比以往任何时候更加猛烈。
    2月13日，正是古巴政府同苏联签订贸易协定的当天，美国驻古巴大使馆立即发表干涉性的声明，扬言美国要根据古苏贸易协定来修订它购买古巴糖的政策。14日，“纽约时报”发表社论威胁说，这项协定会“使美国那些主张对古巴进行报复的人紧握拳头”。
    据美国通讯社报道，美国当局在上星期召集的全国糖业主会议上正式宣布，美国政府已经决定要求国会授权总统随时削减糖的进口定额。
    “基督教科学箴言报”在谈到这一措施时指出，“这是把相当于现代海军陆战队的东西交到总司令手里，使他在最有效的时机来运用它。”
    经济措施伴随着毫不隐讳的军事干涉准备。美国统治集团正阴谋伺机动用武装干涉的“大棒”来扼杀古巴革命。目前，大批美国武装部队正在加勒比海地区连续举行针对古巴的威胁性“演习”，从美国基地出动的飞机不顾古巴政府抗议一再袭击古巴领土。与此同时，疯狂的殖民主义势力正在美国国内制造“舆论”，要求对古巴实行赤裸裸的武力镇压政策。
    以鼓吹干涉古巴而臭名昭著的佛罗里达州参议员斯马瑟斯叫嚷：“在我们准备对古巴所作的事情上采取全面战略的时机已经到来。”据1月30日的“国民前卫”周刊说，在美国国会和报刊上已经有不少人吵嚷着要采取“最古老的手段——“调动海军陆战队”来对付古巴。
    华盛顿“明星晚报”1月29日的评论也鼓吹采取“显示实力的做法”。报纸说，对古巴采取强硬行动将会受到“欢迎”。“纽约邮报”在解释美国预定在3月间在波多黎各举行的威胁古巴的大规模军事演习的用意时说，这次演习将使卡斯特罗清楚地了解，“美国有能力在几小时内把重兵和重型战争设备运到古巴”。
    一些美国政客和报纸在竭力鼓吹立即利用控制在美国手里的泛美工具——首先是美洲国家组织——来实行对古巴的干涉。参议员霍斯默宣布他将在国会中提出议案，要求“授权美洲国家（组织）立即采取单独或集体的行动”。
    但是，美国统治集团的许多报刊在谈到美国干涉古巴的部署时不能不估计到拉丁美洲形势中对美国十分不利的一面。它们承认古巴革命在拉丁美洲深得人心，并担心美国对古巴做得过于露骨就会遭到拉丁美洲人民的一致反对，因而主张在策划侵略行动的同时，应当在表面上打着“不干涉”的旗帜，来麻痹公众视听。
    然而，美帝国主义当前对古巴的所作所为早就为人们所熟悉了。美国“工人周报”指出，美国“用这种或那种方式干涉古巴的危险比过去任何时候更大了”。美国的这种阴谋日益遭到古巴人民和世界公众舆论的无情揭露。正像古巴“战斗报”所指出的，对于这种阴谋，古巴人民正在时刻警惕着。全世界爱好和平的人民都在密切注视着美国对古巴的干涉阴谋。
