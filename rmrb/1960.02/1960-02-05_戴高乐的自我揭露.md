    De Gaulle's Self-Exposure
    Da Peng
    The riots of the French extremist colonial elements in Algeria have met with a shameful defeat. This is the result of the persistent struggle of the peace-loving people in France.
    From the process of the riots, people have also seen the De Gaulle regime's indulgence and compromise attitude towards this small group of extreme right-wing elements.
    The occurrence of this riot was originally the result of the surface-level strategic differences between the local financial colonial group represented by French President De Gaulle and the French plantation owner colonial group in Algeria in dealing with the Algerian issue. The dismissal of Massu, the commander of the Algiers defense and civil administrator, and the head of the Algerian fascist riot in May 1958, for publicly opposing De Gaulle's approach to the Algerian issue, became an excuse for the extremists "who wanted to maintain their medieval colonialism at the cost of French blood" to launch the riot.
    Faced with the riots of these fascist elements, what methods did De Gaulle take to ease the contradiction between him and them? The French government constantly broadcast De Gaulle's speech on the 29th to the rioting fascist elements, advising them not to "go astray." One cannot help but wonder: Why did De Gaulle think that his speech would be so effective in calming the dissatisfaction of the rioters?
    It turns out that De Gaulle was trying his best to appease the extremist colonialists in his speech, telling them to be completely assured of his policies on the Algerian issue.
    As everyone knows, De Gaulle proposed a plan to resolve the Algerian issue on September 16 last year, formally recognizing the Algerian people's right to "self-determination." He said at the time that self-determination would be embodied in a "referendum" to be determined by France "no later than four years after the actual restoration of peace." In the "referendum," Algerians would choose from three options: independence (called "separation" in De Gaulle's words), merging with France, and internal autonomy (i.e., the establishment of an "autonomous government" controlled by France in terms of economy, education, defense, and diplomacy). In any case, the privileges of French colonists in the exploitation, transportation, and export of Saharan oil would be guaranteed. However, such a "new plan" by De Gaulle was still not "understood" by the French extremist colonial elements. Therefore, De Gaulle had to "enlighten" them.
    At the beginning of his speech, De Gaulle declared that he wanted to "take action so as not to finally lose Algeria," because "losing Algeria would be a disaster for us (referring to France) and for the West." Then, he used "clear and straightforward" words to comfort those extremist colonialists. He said: "France and De Gaulle give Algerians the freedom to choose" does not "mean to abandon you, to withdraw from Algeria, and hand Algeria over to the rebels (referring to the Algerian people)." He also emotionally declared: The French ruling authorities "sent 500,000 troops to Algeria, maintained the troops there, provided a large amount of materials, promised that many of our children (referring to the French people) would make sacrifices there, this year's civil and military budget there amounts to one trillion old francs, implemented extensive development work there, spent a lot of effort and funds to develop Saharan oil and gas, and transported the oil and gas all the way to the coast, is this to abandon you? Is this to lose Algeria?"
    In this way, De Gaulle completely exposed the trick of so-called "self-determination" for the Algerian people. De Gaulle promised to "give Algerians the freedom to choose," but it was only to let them choose between Algeria belonging to France or France continuing to occupy Algeria. Anyway, France cannot lose Algeria. This is a very clear matter. No wonder De Gaulle blamed the French extremist colonialists: "How can you still have any doubts about this?"

    戴高乐的自我揭露
    大鹏
    法国极端殖民分子在阿尔及利亚的暴乱，已遭到了可耻的失败。这是由于法国本国爱好和平人民坚持斗争的结果。
    人们从暴乱事件的过程中，也看到了戴高乐政权对这一小撮极右分子的纵容和妥协态度。
    这次暴乱的发生，本来是以法国总统戴高乐为代表的本土金融殖民集团和阿尔及利亚境内法国庄园主殖民集团之间，在对待阿尔及利亚问题的策略分歧表面化的结果。阿尔及利亚城防司令兼民政长官、1958年5月阿尔及利亚法西斯暴乱头子马絮，因为公开反对戴高乐在阿尔及利亚问题上的作法而被撤职，这件事成了“要以法国人鲜血为代价，来保持他们的中世纪式的殖民主义”的极端分子发动暴乱的借口。
    面对着这些法西斯分子的暴乱，戴高乐采取什么样的办法来缓和他同他们之间的矛盾的呢？法国政府不断向暴乱的法西斯分子广播戴高乐29日发表的劝告他们不要“误入迷途”的演说。人们不能不产生这样的疑问：戴高乐为什么会认为他的这篇演说能够对平伏暴乱分子的不满有那末大的效力呢？
    原来，戴高乐是在演说中竭力安抚极端殖民主义分子，叫他们对他在阿尔及利亚问题上的政策完全放心。
    大家知道：戴高乐去年9月16日提出了一个解决阿尔及利亚问题的方案，正式承认了阿尔及利亚人民的“自决”权利。他当时说，自决将体现在“实际恢复和平以后至迟不过四年”内由法国确定举行的“公民投票”上，在“公民投票”时，阿尔及利亚人将从独立（按戴高乐的话说叫“分离”）、同法国合并以及内政自治（即成立在经济、教育、国防和外交方面受法国控制的“自治政府”）等三种办法中选择其一。无论在哪种情况下，法国殖民者对撒哈拉石油的开采、运输和运往国外等特权，都将要得到保证。但是戴高乐这样的一个“新方案”却仍然不能为法国的极端殖民主义分子所“谅解”，因此，戴高乐不能不对他们从事一番“开导”。
    戴高乐在他的演说中一开头就声明：他是要“采取行动使得不致终于丧失阿尔及利亚”，因为“丧失了阿尔及利亚，对我们（指法国）和对西方来说都是一场灾难”。然后，他就用“明确而干脆”的话来安慰那些极端殖民主义分子。他说：“法国和戴高乐给予阿尔及利亚人以自由选择”，并不“就是想抛弃你们，想退出阿尔及利亚，并把阿尔及利亚交给叛乱者（指阿尔及利亚人民）”。他还大动感情地表白道：法国统治当局“派了五十万军队到阿尔及利亚去，把军队维持在那里，给予大批的物资，答应我们的许多儿女（指法国人民）在那里作出牺牲，今年用在那里的民政和军事预算达一万亿旧法郎，在那里实施广大的开发工作，花了很多努力和资金开发撒哈拉的石油和煤气，把石油和煤气一直输到海边，这难道是要放弃你们吗？难道是要丢掉阿尔及利亚吗？”
    这样，戴高乐就把所谓给予阿尔及利亚人民“自决”的把戏完全揭穿了。戴高乐答应“给予阿尔及利亚人以自由选择”，原来只不过是要让他们在阿尔及利亚属于法国或者法国继续占有阿尔及利亚之间进行选择，反正法国是不能丧失阿尔及利亚的。这是很清楚的事情。难怪戴高乐要责怪法国的极端殖民主义者：“你们对于这一点怎么还能有所怀疑呢？”
