Xinhua News Agency, dated 14th: As China's rural areas are undergoing agricultural technology transformation, various military branches and arms of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, related factories, schools, and machinery repair departments are doing everything possible to trial-produce agricultural machinery, help rural areas train technical personnel, and install and repair various machines, contributing to agricultural mechanization.

Under the slogan "Even if we are very busy, we must work for agricultural mechanization," the relevant factories and schools of the troops are tapping equipment potential and carrying out agricultural machinery trial production and production activities in the intervals of completing their own repair, manufacturing, and teaching tasks. Several factories in the ordnance repair department produced tens of thousands of tractors, water pumps, electric motors, lathes, and blowers for rural areas last year. Under the principle of combining education and production, a certain air force school processed 250,000 various machine parts for rural areas last year. More than 8,500 diesel engines and water pumps manufactured by a naval school using internship production time were mostly supplied to rural areas. The repair plant of the Shanghai garrison, with the efforts of the vast number of military workers, overcame many difficulties such as insufficient factory buildings and equipment and poor technical conditions, and cooperated in the successful trial production of the "Red Flag" brand hand-held tractor. After being certified by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Agriculture, it has been produced in batches. This tractor can cultivate and loosen soil on dry land. After removing the tires and replacing them with iron wing wheels, it can also be used in paddy fields. The V-belt pulley installed on the flywheel side of its diesel engine can also drive agricultural tools or tools for pumping water, generating electricity, threshing, transporting, mowing, spraying powder, etc. Because of its wide range of uses, dexterity, and sturdiness, it is very popular among farmers. Many troops also provide manpower, machines, and materials to help people's communes run agricultural tool manufacturing plants, small agricultural machinery repair plants, etc. The machinery repair plant set up by a naval unit to help Huangyan County, Zhejiang, can now produce dozens of kinds of machinery urgently needed in rural areas, such as electric threshers and jaw crushers. At the beginning of the plant's construction, only Chen Hanming, the deputy chief of the management section, and Zhou Xinzhi, the political instructor, sent by this unit, brought a few skilled soldiers to carry out production using a lathe, a welding machine, and a few pliers and other small tools from the troops. Under the leadership of the County Committee of the Communist Party of China, after more than a year of efforts, the factory now has more than 500 workers. The communications corps sent more than 45,000 pieces of equipment to the commune last year, including more than 18,000 meters of lamp wires and telephone wires.

Many units help rural areas train technical personnel. According to preliminary statistics from the troops in the Beijing area, more than 3,900 technical personnel of various types were trained for the people's communes last year, and more than 6,600 machines (pieces) were helped to be installed and repaired. When the armored forces helped the tractor stations in the garrison area train tractor drivers and repairmen, they generally implemented guaranteed teaching and learning, so that some tractor stations had a surplus of tractor drivers. Many tractor stations achieved the level of "small repairs in the fields, medium repairs without entering the factory" because the repair level was greatly improved. Last year, the railway soldiers trained 50,000 technical workers for rural areas through centralized training, decentralized training, and printing technical manuals. A certain railway soldier unit stationed in Zhejiang also sent a complete set of technicians such as lathe workers, fitters, electricians, and foundry workers to the Huzhou Farm Tool Factory to help work, assisting in production while teaching technology, so that the technical capacity of the factory has been rapidly improved.

### 为公社生产农业机械　为公社培养技术人材  解放军热情支援农业技术改造

    为公社生产农业机械　为公社培养技术人材
    解放军热情支援农业技术改造
    据新华社14日讯　在我国农村正在进行农业技术改造的时候，中国人民解放军各军种、兵种部队和有关工厂、学校、机械修理部门等，千方百计试制农业机械，帮助农村培养技术人员和安装、修理各种机器，为农业机械化贡献力量。
    在“千忙万忙也要为农业机械化忙”的口号下，部队的有关工厂、学校在完成本身的修理、制造和教学任务的空隙，都在挖掘设备潜力，进行农业机械的试制和生产活动。军械修理部门的几个工厂，去年就为农村生产了成万部拖拉机、抽水机、电动机、车床和鼓风机等。空军某学校在教育和生产相结合的方针下，去年为农村加工的各种机器零件达二十五万件。海军某学校利用实习生产的时间，制造的八千五百多台柴油机、水泵等也多半供应了农村。上海驻军的修配厂，在广大军工的努力下，克服了厂房设备不足、技术条件差等许多困难，协作试制成功“红旗”牌手扶式拖拉机，经上海市农业局鉴定合格以后，已成批生产。这种拖拉机能在旱地上耕地、松土，把汽轮胎拆下换上铁翼轮后，又能在水田里使用。它的柴油机引擎飞轮边上装的三角皮带轮，还可以带动农具或工具，用来抽水、发电、脱粒、运输、割草、喷射药粉等。由于它用途广、灵巧坚固，深受农民的欢迎。许多部队还出人、出机器、物资，帮助人民公社办农具制造厂、小型农业机械修配厂等。海军某部帮助浙江黄岩县办起来的机械修配厂，现在能生产电动脱谷机、颚式破碎机等几十种农村急需的机械。这个厂建厂初期只有这支部队派去的管理科副科长陈汉明、政治指导员周信芝带去的几个有技术的战士，使用从部队带去的一部车床、一台电焊机和几把老虎钳等少量工具进行生产。他们在中共县委领导下，经过一年多的努力，现在这个厂已经有五百多名工人了。通信兵部队去年送给公社的器材四万五千多件，电灯线、电话线等一万八千多米。
    不少单位帮助农村培养技术人员。北京地区部队初步统计，去年帮助人民公社培养的各种技术人员有三千九百多名，帮助安装和修理的机器达六千六百多台（件）。装甲兵部队在帮助驻地拖拉机站训练拖拉机手和修理工的时候，普遍实行了包教保学，使有些拖拉机站的拖拉机手由不足变成有余，不少拖拉机站因为修理水平大为提高，达到了拖拉机“小修在田头，中修不进厂”的水平。铁道兵部队去年通过集中训练、分散培养、印发技术手册等办法，去年为农村培养出五万名技术工人。驻浙江的铁道兵某部，还派出车工、钳工、电工、翻砂工等整套技术人员到湖州农具厂去帮助工作，一边协助生产，一边教技术，使这个工厂的技术能力有了飞速的提高。
