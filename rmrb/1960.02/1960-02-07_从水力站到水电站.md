    From Water Power Station to Hydroelectric Station
    Wu Jiasen, First Secretary of the CPC Xudun Commune Committee
    Our Xudun Commune in Jian'ou County, Fujian Province, is located in a mountainous area with crisscrossing streams and rivers, possessing abundant water resources, making it an ideal place to develop rural water power and hydroelectric power. Last autumn, under the guidance of the principles of small-scale focus, production focus, commune management focus, and prioritizing water power before hydroelectric power, we spent just over a month and built fifty-six water power stations in one fell swoop. This allowed every brigade and every village in the entire commune to have a water power station, basically achieving the mechanization and water powerization of grain and feed processing. The entire commune's water power stations have a total of over 200 horsepower, driving more than 100 machines for rice husking, sweet potato slicing, feed processing, and other tasks, saving the commune more than 500,000 labor days each year. Because the water power stations provide a large amount of cheap power and save a large amount of labor, they have effectively promoted the development of commune-run industries such as fertilizer, paper making, and timber processing.
    The benefits that water power stations have brought to our commune are significant. With the continuous high-speed leaps forward in industrial and agricultural production, our Xudun Commune, like many other fraternal communes, first encountered the difficulty of insufficient labor; the development of the objective situation required us to accelerate the realization of agricultural technological transformation and use more machinery to replace manpower. Developing the rural electric power industry is a good way to solve the power problem.
    However, how to develop the rural electric power industry? Should we reach out to the state for equipment and wait for the state to help us build it, or should we do it ourselves and start with simple and crude methods first? After studying the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, we criticized the thinking of valuing foreign things and disregarding local things, and not proceeding from reality. We resolutely adopted the principle of self-reliance and adapting to local conditions, and decided to develop the rural electric power industry in two steps. Before we could install motors, we first built water power stations to drive machinery with water power, solve the difficulty of insufficient labor, and create conditions for building hydroelectric power stations and installing motors by accumulating funds.
    When building water power stations, we also tried our best to adapt to local conditions and utilize existing favorable conditions. The first secretary of the commune party committee took personal command, leading more than 20 earthworkers and commune members to use an old and discarded water mill as an "experimental field," and spent eight days to rebuild it into a water power station. After this water mill was converted into a water power station, it could process 2,000 catties of rice per day, saving ten laborers. Subsequently, the Party Committee immediately organized commune members to visit and discuss. Faced with the vivid facts, those who originally thought that big things could not be done with indigenous methods and that only building hydroelectric power stations in one step would be useful were all convinced. The broad masses also realized the significance of developing the rural electric power industry in two steps, and resolved to go back and promote it immediately. In this way, all major brigades in the entire commune converted all fifty-five old water mills into water power stations in about a month. Since the water power stations utilized the old water mill's axles and canals, it not only reduced the project, shortened the time, but also saved funds. A water power station generally only required more than ten workers and cost more than 100 yuan to rebuild successfully. In just three to five days, the water power station drove various machines. After the machines started running, the power of the water power station was quickly seen by people. The sweet potato slicing machine driven by water power can slice more than 750 catties per hour, which is 35 to 40 times higher than manual work. The rice husking machine can husk 2,000 catties of rice a day, which is nine times more efficient than manpower; the feed processing machine can cut 10,000 catties of water hyacinth a day, which is 50 times higher than manual work. This enabled the entire commune to save more than 1,400 female laborers to enrich the front line of production.
    The result of vigorously running water power stations in the past few months has not only greatly changed our situation of labor shortage, but also cultivated technical strength and accumulated the funds needed for the construction of power stations. Now, all commune members in our commune are confidently advancing towards the goal of converting water power stations into hydroelectric power stations. The first batch of reconstruction projects has already started, and soon six water power stations will be converted into hydroelectric power stations. The facts clearly tell us that developing the rural electric power industry in two steps is not low speed but high speed. Building water power stations first when motors cannot be installed is quick to start and quick to take effect, preparing technical strength and material prerequisites for accelerating the construction of hydroelectric power stations.

    从水力站到水电站
    中共徐墩公社党委第一书记　吴家森
    我们福建建瓯县徐墩公社地处山区，溪河沟涧纵横，水力资源很丰富，是发展农村水力、水电事业的好地方。去年秋天，我们在小型为主，生产为主，社办为主，先水力后水电的方针指导下，仅仅花了一个多月的时间，一举建成了五十六座水力站，使全公社各个大队，每个村子都有了水力站，基本上实现了粮食和饲料加工机械化，水力化。全社水力站共有二百多马力，带动砻谷、番薯切丝、饲料加工等各种机器一百多部，每年可以为公社节省五十多万个劳动日。由于水力站提供了大量的廉价动力，节省了大量的劳动力，有效地促进了化肥、造纸、木材加工等社办工业的发展。
    水力站给我们公社带来的好处是很大的。随着工农业生产的连续高速度跃进，我们徐墩公社和其它许多兄弟公社一样，首先遇到的是劳动力不足的困难；客观形势的发展，要求我们加速实现农业技术改造，用更多的机械来代替人力。发展农村电力工业，就是解决动力的好办法。
    但是，怎样来发展农村电力工业呢？是伸手向国家要设备，坐着等待国家来帮助我们办呢，还是自己动手，因陋就简地先办起来呢？我们学习了党的八届八中全会决议以后，批判了重洋轻土，不从实际出发的思想，坚决采取了自力更生，同时因地制宜的原则，决定分两步走发展农村电力工业。在不能安装电机以前，先把水力站建立起来，用水力带动机械，解决劳动力不足的困难，并且为建立水电站、安装电机积累资金创造条件。
    在建立水力站时，我们也尽量因地制宜，利用原有可以利用的有利条件。公社党委第一书记亲自挂帅，带领二十多个土木工和社员，以原有的一座废旧水碓作“试验田”，用八天时间改建成水力站。这座水碓改为水力站后，每天能加工稻谷二千斤，节省十个劳动力。随后，党委立即组织社员群众边参观，边议论。在活生生的事实面前，原来认为土办法办不了大事，只有一步登天搞水电站才顶用的人，都心服口服了。广大群众也认识到分两步发展农村电力工业的意义，决心回去立即推广。就这样，全公社各大队在一个月左右时间内，就把五十五座旧水碓全部改建成水力站。由于水力站利用了旧水碓的车轴和水渠，不仅减少了工程、缩短了时间，而且节约了资金。一个水力站一般只用十多个工，花一百多元就改建成功。只要三、五天时间，水力站就把各种机器带动起来了。机器转动起来以后，水力站的威力很快就被人们看出了。水力带动的番薯切丝机，每小时可切丝七百五十多斤，比手工提高了三十五到四十倍，砻谷机一天可砻谷二千斤，比人力提高效率九倍；饲料加工机每天能切一万斤水浮莲，比人工高出五十倍。这样，使全社节省出一千四百多个妇女劳动力充实到生产第一线。
    几个月来，大办水力站的结果，不仅使我们劳动力缺乏的状况有了很大改变，而且为我们培养了技术力量和积累了建设电站需要的资金。现在我们全社社员正信心百倍地向着把水力站改建成水电站的目标前进。第一批改建工程已经开工，不久就有六个水力站改建成水电站。事实清楚地告诉我们：发展农村电力事业分两步走不是低速度而是高速度。在不能安装电机的时候先建水力站，上马快、收效也快，为加速水电站的建设准备了技术力量和物质前提。
