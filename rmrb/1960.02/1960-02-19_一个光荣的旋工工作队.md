    A Glorious Lathe Operator Work Team

    The lathe operator, János Szaszecsko, is not only the best lathe operator in the "Láng" factory, but also one of the best lathe operators in Hungary.

    Ten Years of Glorious History

    About ten years ago, on his initiative, a work team was established in the "Láng" factory. They named their work team after the great Hungarian poet, Endre Ady. The "Ady" work team consisted of six experienced lathe operators. The youngest of them had twenty-five years of experience. Each of them was proficient in their own business and had superb skills. Therefore, shortly after the establishment of their work team, they took first place in a competition to celebrate the anniversary of Hungary's liberation.

    In the ten years since its establishment, this work team has won countless victories and significant achievements. In the inter-factory competition between the three largest machine manufacturing plants in Hungary—"Győri Wagon és Gépgyár" (Győr Wagon and Machine Factory), "Láng" and "April 4th"—the "Láng" factory's work team has won three times, and was awarded the title of "Hungary's Best Lathe Operator Work Team."

    During the counter-revolutionary rebellion in October 1956, this work team remained united. After this event, the work team was an initiator of restarting the socialist emulation campaign. In ten years, none of the members of this work team had ever been late. They also never produced a single piece of defective product.

    A Young Worker Produced Defective Products

    Not long ago, their work team produced a defective product. The story is this: the oldest worker in the work team, Gyula Modrovszky, retired. Before he left the job, the work team had discussed who would replace his work. The old workers all agreed to let a young worker join their work team. The old workers also expressed their willingness to help him. Later, their work team let a young worker join. This young worker was fortunate to become a member of this glorious work team, but because he did not yet have such superb skills, after he finished his work on the first day, he found that he had damaged a part. It was only a very small part, but it was, after all, a defective product. Therefore, in the second quarter of last year, this excellent work team named "Ady" fell to second place in the competition to welcome the Hungarian Party Congress.

    Patiently Train Successors

    In order to restore the collective reputation of the work team, the self-respecting old workers were not discouraged, but instead comforted the young man and patiently helped him to check his mistakes and overcome difficulties. The old workers said with full confidence: "For us, this can only be a happy thing. You don't know, we fell to second place because a new generation of young lathe operators are replacing us. We will definitely work hard in the future to make our younger generation work better than us."

    Three months have passed since then. János Szaszecsko has also retired, but not a day goes by that he doesn't come to see the work team he used to work with. Like the other old workers, he continues to help young workers solve problems encountered in their work.

    The old workers' words have indeed come true. Last year, their team exceeded its work plan, and apart from that one defective product, there were no more defective products.

    一个光荣的旋工工作队
    旋工亚诺什·沙斯切克不仅是“兰格”工厂最优秀的旋工，而且也是匈牙利全国最优秀的旋工之一。
    十年的光辉历史
    约在十年以前，根据他的倡议，“兰格”工厂里成立了一个工作队。他们把匈牙利伟大的诗人安德烈·阿吉的名字作为工作小队的队名。参加“阿吉”工作队的，有六个经验丰富的旋工。他们当中最年轻的工人，也有了二十五年的工龄。他们每一个人都精通自己的业务，有着娴熟的技巧。因而，在他们工作队成立不久，在一次迎接匈牙利解放节日的竞赛中，就占了第一位。
    这个工作队，在自己成立十年的历史中，不知获得了多少次胜利和显著的成绩。在匈牙利三个最大的机器制造厂——“吉马瓦戈”、“兰格”和“四月四日”——的厂际竞赛中，“兰格”厂的这个工作队曾三次获得胜利，并得到了“匈牙利最优秀旋工工作队”的称号。
    在1956年10月反革命叛乱事件的时候，这个工作队仍然保持自己的团结一致。在这次事件以后，这个工作队曾是重新展开社会主义竞赛的倡议者。在十年之间，这个工作队的任何一个成员从来没有迟到过一次。他们也没有出过一件废品。
  青年工人出了废品
    不久以前，他们工作队曾出了一件废品。事情是这样：工作队一位最老的工人久拉·莫德罗茨基退休了。还在他离开工作以前，工作队就曾讨论过谁来代替他的工作问题。老工人们都一致主张让一个年青的工人来参加他们的工作队。老工人们还都表示愿意来帮助他。后来，他们的工作队让一个青年工人参加进来。这个青年工人幸运地成了这个光荣工作队的一员，可是因为他还没有那样娴熟的技巧，在第一天他完工以后，就发现损坏了一个零件。说起来只不过是一个很小的零件，但是毕竟是一件废品。因此，在去年第二季度里，这个以“阿吉”命名的优秀工作队，在迎接匈牙利党代表会的竞赛中落到了第二位。
    耐心培养接班人
    为了挽回工作队的集体声誉，有着自尊心的老工人们，不但不灰心丧气，而且对这个青年还安慰了一番，耐心地帮助他检查错误，克服了困难。老工人都信心百倍地说：“对于我们来说，这只能是一件高兴的事。你们哪里知道，我们落到第二位，是因为新一代青年旋工来换我们的班。我们今后一定努力让我们的青年一代人工作得比我们更好。”
    从这个时候起，三个月过去了。亚诺什·沙斯切克也退休了，可是没有一天他不来看望他曾工作的这个工作队。他依然像其他的老工人一样，不断地帮助青年工人解决工作中遇到的问题。
    老工人们的话果然实现了。去年他们小队的工作计划超额完成了，除了那一件废品外，再没有出现过任何一件废品。
