    Marvelous Innovation in Urban Construction Technology
    Laying Sewage Pipes Without Pavement Excavation
    Beijing Creates the Multi-Pick Underground Pipe Jacking Method
    (Our Dispatch) The workers of the First Construction Site of the Third Municipal Engineering Company of Beijing have successfully developed a construction method for laying sewage pipes without excavating the pavement: the multi-pick underground pipe jacking method. Compared with the old open-cut method, this construction method increases construction efficiency by more than double, saves half the labor force, reduces costs by 64%, and saves materials such as support timber and formwork. Because less soil is excavated, it also saves on transportation.
    Using this method, the workers at this construction site have already laid a sewage pipe with a diameter of 1.6 meters under Chongwenmen Street, passing through obstacles such as city walls and railways, for a total length of 270 meters. During the laying process, trams, cars, and pedestrians on the street continued to travel as usual. In the past, laying sewers involved first excavating the pavement into trenches and then burying the pipes, often disrupting traffic during the construction period. In the case of buildings, relocation was also necessary.
    The procedure for this new sewer laying method is as follows: first, a working pit is dug away from the road surface. Then, a soil winch lifts the sewage pipe into the pit. Next, three workers rock three hydraulic jacks placed on top of the pipe, slowly pushing the pipe forward. As the pipe is pushed forward, one worker drills at the very front of the pipe, which is equipped with lighting and ventilation, cutting soil to clear the way for the pipe like digging a tunnel. The excavated soil is loaded by another worker into a soil box on a four-wheeled flatbed cart (or electric flatbed cart) and transported along the light rail laid inside the pipe to the pipe opening. At this point, the soil winch lifts the soil box from underground onto a flatbed cart on the surface for transport. During the pipe jacking process, the workers use a soil level instrument they created to measure the direction of the pipe's advance, correcting errors at any time. (Photo attached)

    城市建设技术革新的奇花异葩
    不刨路面铺设下水管道
    北京创造多镐地下顶管法
    本报讯　北京市第三市政工程公司第一工地职工，研究成功一套不用刨开路面铺设下水管道的施工方法——多镐地下顶管法。这种施工法，同过去的开槽施工法比较，施工效率提高一倍多，劳动力节省二分之一，造价降低64％，并节省了撑木、模板等材料。由于挖出的土少，还节省了运输工具。
    这个工地的工人们，采用这种方法在崇文门大街的地下，已经铺成一条直径一点六米的下水管道，沿途穿过城墙和铁道等障碍物，全长二百七十米。铺设的时候，街上的电车、汽车和行人，仍像往常一样穿梭往来。过去，铺设下水道都是先刨开路面，挖成土沟，再埋下管道。在施工期内，往往要断绝交通。遇到房屋，还必须拆迁。
    这种新的铺设下水道的施工方法程序是这样的：首先在离开路面的地方挖一个工作坑，然后用土卷扬机把下水管道吊到坑内。接着，三个工人摇动放在管子顶端的三个油压千斤顶，把管子徐徐向前推进。在管子推进的时候，有一个工人钻在装有照明和通风设备的管道的最前端，像挖隧道一样地为管子切土开路。挖出来的泥土，由另外一个工人把它装入四轮平板小车（或电动平车）上的土箱内，沿着管内铺设的轻便轨道运到管口。这时，土卷扬机就把土箱从地下吊到地面上的平板小车上运走。在顶管过程中，工人们用自己创造的土水平仪器，测量管子推进的方向，随时纠正误差。（附图片）
