The "Giant" of the Bode Valley
German Democratic Republic, Hè Yuē· Hā'ěrtōng

In the legendary Harz Mountains of the German Democratic Republic, a modern "giant" has risen. Not long ago, Germany's largest dam was put into use in the Rappbode Valley. The fierce Bode River and its tributaries, which had caused floods and droughts for centuries, have been tamed, and the threat to the lives and property of the people of the Harz region has finally disappeared.

Centuries of Disasters

"15390a," a chronicler of Quedlinburg recorded for posterity: "The Bode River overflowed its banks. The water was so powerful that it flowed through ditches into houses and granaries. Many livestock perished. Some poorly constructed houses were washed away by the flood!"

The danger was especially great during the snowmelt season. For example, in the last days of 1925, a warm current entered the wintery central German region, causing heavy rainfall. Clouds lingered on the peaks of the Harz Mountains, suddenly turning into rain. Snowmelt also rushed down the valleys with the rain, because the mountains were covered with almost one and a half meters of snow at that time. The steep slopes of the Bode Valley caused the floodwaters to surge and rampage, sweeping away everything in their path. The dikes in the flatter areas could not withstand the pressure of the flood peak and cracked, creating breaches several kilometers long, opening the way for the floodwaters to engulf fertile fields. On New Year's Eve, the water in the low-lying streets of Quedlinburg was about one meter deep. The floodwaters submerged the city center square, washed away bridges, and forced the gas plant and power plant to shut down.

Another danger in the eastern Harz region was drought. In summer, the Bode River turned into a small stream, and the water could not be used to irrigate farmland, supply residential areas, or serve the growing industry. The groundwater level often dropped so low that it caused fields to dry up, and the supply of drinking water and industrial water to residents was also affected.

Bourgeois Governments Failed to Eliminate Disasters for the People

In the past, there had been many plans to manage the rivers, store water, and use water in the Harz Mountains. The councilors and citizens of Quedlinburg often argued fiercely over these plans. After the great flood of 1897, they had hoped that the idea of building reservoirs on the Bode River and its tributaries could finally be realized. Their hopes were dashed because the valleys behind the dams would be submerged by the water stored, and these valleys belonged to the dukes and princes, who sat high in their castles, untouched by the floods. They would not spend money to build reservoirs.

At the beginning of the twentieth century, city councilors responsible for social relief reconsidered the idea of building reservoirs. They formed a water conservancy association, which included all the cities and towns threatened by floods. The association wanted to realize the plan to build reservoirs together with the state. This plan failed again because people could not agree on how to use the stored water in the future. The people of Halberstadt demanded that the water be used to irrigate farmland, the Prussians insisted on transporting the water to the inland canal, and the people of Magdeburg were only willing to pay if their city received enough drinking water. The debate about water use began, but the construction of reservoirs did not begin.

In later decades, new plans were drawn up, and construction finally began. However, before the first shovelful of earth could be turned, Hitler diverted the construction forces for building reservoirs to build bunkers and air-raid shelters for his war of aggression.

The People Built Germany's Largest Dam

It was not until the establishment of the German Democratic Republic – the first German state of workers and peasants – that the plan became a reality, and Germany's largest dam was built. However, the Rappbode Dam is only part of a great project. It belongs to a complete reservoir system, namely the Bode River Water Conservancy Project.

In the upstream valleys of the Harz Mountains, the Bode River has been dammed many times. The Warm Bode River flows into the valley from the northwest; the Cold Bode River also flows from the northwest. According to the plans of the hydraulic engineers, the first batch of dams was built here. Their task is to stop the earliest floodwaters and then transport the water to the downstream reservoirs as evenly as possible.

After the two rivers merge into the Great Bode River behind these dams, the water passes through several reservoirs. Originally, the main dam should have been built here, because the Great Bode River can be regarded as the main water supplier. However, the valley here is not deep enough or wide enough, and the water stored would inevitably sacrifice many places to artificial lakes. Therefore, the hydraulic engineers decided to build a diversion dam, and the water it impounds flows into the main reservoir through an underground tunnel nearly two kilometers long.

Today, this main dam, 420 meters long and 106 meters high, stands majestically in the deep and long Rappbode Valley. This modern "giant," which from now on will tame and regulate the floods of the Bode River, has consumed 860,000 cubic meters of concrete. Behind the dam and between the towering ridges, this eight-kilometer-long artificial lake has stored 110 million cubic meters of water.

Using the "Giant" to Supply Clean Drinking Water

Two more pre-dams are being built on the tributaries upstream of the artificial lake. Their task is to clarify the water flowing into the reservoir first and remove silt and debris from the water, because the water in the large reservoir is also used for drinking. In addition, these two pre-dams have another task: to prevent the shallow areas of the Rappbode Reservoir from drying up when the water level of the Rappbode Reservoir falls. This greatly avoids evaporation and mosquito breeding.

Downstream of the large dam, a seventh dam is also being built, so that a new lake will appear between this dam and the Rappbode Dam. This reservoir, as an intermediate reservoir, regulates the transport of water during hot and dry seasons.

The "Giant" of the Bode Valley will also supply a sufficient amount of drinking water – about two cubic meters per second. The water flows through a three-kilometer-long underground tunnel to the new water plant. In the future, there are plans to lay a 400-kilometer-long pipeline to supply 60 million cubic meters of drinking water to the industrial areas around Magdeburg and Halle-Merseburg every year.

When designing the Bode River reservoir system, the possibility of turning the tamed water power into electricity was also taken into account. For example, it is planned to use the drinking water to drive a power station, continuously supplying the generated electricity to the power grid. New power stations will be built on the steep slopes of each dam. There is also an underground tunnel that leads water to the city of Thale. There will be a power station there to supply the generated electricity primarily to the city's industrial sectors.

In this way, a project that successive German governments have failed to complete since 1890 is about to be completed. Workers and engineers are building the Bode River Water Conservancy Project – a socialist great project of the German Democratic Republic – in socialist collective labor. In the future, the historians of Quedlinburg will no longer report on floods and droughts in the annals, but on a modern "giant" that has grown up in the Bode Valley and tamed the power of nature according to the will of the people.

    波得河谷的“巨人”
    德意志民主共和国　赫·约·哈尔通
    在德意志民主共和国充满传说的哈尔茨山区增加了一个现代化的“巨人”。不久前，德国最大的拦河坝在拉普波得河谷移交使用。几百年来造成水旱灾害的凶猛的波得河和它的支流被驯服了，对哈尔茨区人民生命财产的威胁终于消失了。
    几百年来的灾害
    “15390a，”奎德林堡的一个纪年史作者为后世作了这样的记载：“波得河漫过了堤岸。水势很大，通过沟渠流进屋子和仓谷。有许多牲畜死于非命。某些建筑得较差的房屋被洪水冲坍了！”
    在化雪时期危险特别大。例如1925年最后几天，一股暖流进入冬天的中德地区，造成了巨大的雨量。云雾滞留在哈尔茨山的山巅，突然化成雨水。雪水也随同雨水冲下山谷，因为那时山上复盖的雪几乎有一米半高。波得河谷的陡斜形势，使得洪水来势汹汹地横冲直撞，把挡住它去路的一切都给冲走了。比较平坦的地区的堤坝抵挡不住洪峰的压力，冲裂了有几公里长的缺口，为洪水席卷肥沃的田地开了路。在大除夕的夜里，奎德林堡地势低矮的街道上的积水大约有一米高。洪水淹没了市中心广场，冲断了桥梁，迫使煤气厂和发电厂停止工作。
    哈尔茨山东部地区的另一危险是干旱。波得河在夏天变成一条小溪，河水既不能被用来灌溉农田和供应住宅区，也不能为日益发展的工业服务。地下水的水平面也常常降落到这样低的程度，造成田地干涸，使居民的饮水和工业用水的供应也受到影响。
    资产阶级政府不能为民除害
    过去曾经有过许多治理哈尔茨山区河流、蓄水和用水的计划。奎德林堡市的议员和市民们常常对这些计划争得面红耳赤。在1897年的大水灾以后，他们曾经希望，在波得河和它的支流上修建水库的想法终于能够获得实现。他们的希望落了空，因为要修建水库，拦洪坝后面的河谷就要被所蓄的水淹没，而这些河谷是属于公侯们的，他们高高地坐在他们的城堡上，洪水损害不了他们的一根汗毛。他们是不会拿出钱来修水库的。
    二十世纪初，负责社会救济工作的市议员们重新想起了修建水库的主张。他们成立了一个水利协会，所有受到洪水威胁的城市和乡镇都参加了这个协会。这个协会想和国家一起实现修建水库的计划。这个打算又失败了，因为人们对将来所蓄的水如何利用的问题没有取得一致意见。哈尔贝施塔特人要求用蓄水来灌溉农田，普鲁士人坚持把水输送给内地运河，而马格德堡人只有当他们的城市得到足够的饮水时才愿意掏钱。关于用水的争论开始了，而水库的修建却并没有开始。
    在后来的几十年中又制订了新的计划，终于开始动工了。但是，第一铲还未铲下，希特勒就把建设水库的施工力量调去为它的侵略战争修建碉堡和防空洞了。
    人民修成了德国最大拦河坝
    直到德意志民主共和国——第一个德意志工农国家建立，计划才成为现实，德国最大的拦河坝修成了。但是，拉普波得拦河坝只是伟大工程的一部分。它属于一个整套水库体系，即波得河水利工程。
    在哈尔茨山的上游河谷中，波得河就已多次被拦住。热波得河从西北流进谷来；冷波得河也从西北流来。按照水利学家的计划，在这儿修建了第一批拦河坝。它们的任务是拦住最早的洪流，然后把河水尽可能均衡地输送给下游的水库。
    两条河在这些堤坝后面汇合成大波得河以后，河水经过几个水库。本来主坝是应当建在这儿的，因为大波得河可算是主要的供水者。但是这里的河谷不够深，也不够宽，拦住的水势必会使许多地方成为人工湖的牺牲品。因此，水利学家们决定修建一条传导坝，它所拦蓄的水通过一条将近有二公里长的地下隧道流入主体水库。
    这条长四百二十米、高一百零六米的主坝，今天巍然耸立在深凹漫长的拉普波得河谷上。这个从今以后将要驯服和调节波得河洪水的现代“巨人”，吞噬了八十六万立方米混凝土。在大坝后面和高耸的山脊之间，这个八公里长的人工湖已经蓄水一亿一千万立方米。
    要“巨人”供应清洁的饮水
    在人工湖上游的支流正在修建另外两个前坝，它们的任务是把流入水库的水先澄清一下，清除水中的泥砂和杂物，因为大水库的水也要饮用。此外这两个前坝还有一个任务：在拉普波得水库水平面下落时，使水库的浅处不至于干涸。这样就大大地避免了蒸发和蚊虫孳生的现象。
    在大拦河坝的下游，还在修建第七道拦河坝，这样，在这道坝和拉普波得大坝之间就会出现一个新的湖。这个水库作为中间水库，在炎热干旱的季节里调节水的输送。
    波得河谷的“巨人”也将供应足够数量的饮水——每秒钟约二立方米。水通过一条三公里长的地下隧道流向新的自来水厂。将来计划铺设一条四百公里长的水管，每年将向马格德堡和哈雷—麦尔赛堡周围的工业区供应六千万立方米饮水。
    在设计波得河水库体系的时候，也考虑到把将被驯服的水力变为电力的可能性。例如计划以饮用的水来推动一个发电站，不断地把发出的电供给电网。在各个拦河坝的陡坡上，将要修建新的发电站。还有一个地下隧道把水引向塔勒市。那儿将有一个发电站把发出的电首先供应给城市的工业部门。
    这样，自从1890年以来历届德国政府所未能完成的一项工程即将竣工。工人和工程师在社会主义集体劳动中建设起波得河水利工程——德意志民主共和国的社会主义大工程。奎德林堡市的历史家将来在纪年史上不会再去报道水旱灾害，而是报道一个在波得河谷成长起来并按照人们的意志驯服自然威力的现代“巨人”。
