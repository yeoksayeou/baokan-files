Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 18th. The Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army wrote to the International Commission in Vietnam on February 15th, protesting the South Vietnamese authorities' recent fabrication of a so-called "insurrection plot" in the Phu Loi concentration camp, attempting to use this as a pretext to carry out a new massacre in the Phu Loi concentration camp.

The letter said that the South Vietnamese authorities recently spread rumors that on September 27th of last year, "inspectors" at the Phu Loi concentration camp caught a so-called "Viet Cong cadre" named Le Van Tu thinking about chopping up soap and citronella and mixing it into the beef cooked for the "prisoners," in an attempt to cause the "prisoners" to suffer from abdominal pain and diarrhea, and take this opportunity to incite the "prisoners" to stir up "riots" that would affect the outside world.

In the letter, the Liaison Delegation of the Vietnam People's Army pointed out that in order to create public opinion in advance for their homicidal crimes, the South Vietnamese authorities also instructed their newspaper, "National Revolutionary News," to clamor for "resolute punishment of the above-mentioned evil deeds." At the end of January this year, the sounds of rifles, light machine guns, and heavy machine guns, threatening the "prisoners" in the concentration camp and nearby residents, were frequently heard around the Phu Loi concentration camp.

The letter further pointed out that the South Vietnamese authorities had allocated 11 million yuan from last year's budget to expand the cells in the Phu Loi concentration camp and add the latest torture instruments. The South Vietnamese authorities have been and are continuing to transfer thousands of political prisoners from various concentration camps in South Vietnam to the Phu Loi concentration camp. All of this proves that the South Vietnamese authorities are intensifying new conspiratorial activities.

The Phu Loi Massacre People's Investigation Committee also issued a statement on February 16th regarding this matter, pointing out that the so-called "case" of Le Van Tu using soap and citronella to poison prisoners in the concentration camp is completely fabricated. The statement listed scientific evidence to prove that soap and citronella are not poisons at all, and pointed out that this is a despicable conspiracy by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to create a new massacre.

The Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army and the Phu Loi Massacre People's Investigation Committee both reiterated their demand that the International Commission in Vietnam immediately investigate the 1958 "Phu Loi Massacre" and force the South Vietnamese authorities to immediately stop continuing to kill former resistance personnel and patriotic people who are illegally detained in the Phu Loi concentration camp.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 17th. The Phu Loi Massacre People's Investigation Committee recently issued a statement here refuting a newly fabricated claim by the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique: that a detainee in the South Vietnamese Phu Loi concentration camp attempted to poison other detainees in the concentration camp.

The statement said that the South Vietnamese authorities fabricated a story that a detainee in the Phu Loi concentration camp was caught putting nearly one kilogram of soap and citronella into the detainees' food. The United States-Ngo Dinh Diem clique accused "Vietnamese Communists" of attempting to murder the detainees in the concentration camp.

In its statement, the Phu Loi Massacre People's Investigation Committee pointed out that this is another trick by the United States-Ngo Dinh Diem clique to cover up the murders they committed.

The statement said that the United States-Ngo Dinh Diem clique is doing everything possible to eliminate the evidence of their crime of poisoning food on December 1, 1958, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,000 detainees in the Phu Loi camp.

The statement demanded that the International Commission in Vietnam conduct an on-site investigation of the Phu Loi concentration camp massacre as soon as possible, because the United States-Ngo Dinh Diem clique is conspiring to use their fascist-style Law No. 10 of 1959 and special military tribunals to murder patriots currently detained in the Phu Loi concentration camp. The statement said that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's mouthpiece has been clamoring for "ruthless punishment of communists."

Earlier, the Phu Loi Massacre People's Investigation Committee had submitted its two investigation reports to the International Commission.

    越南人民军联络代表团函国际委员会揭露
    南越当局制造借口阴谋进行新屠杀
    富利惨案调查委员会列举科学根据揭穿吴庭艳阴谋
    新华社河内18日电　越南人民军总司令部联络代表团2月15日写信给越南国际委员会，抗议南越当局最近在富利集中营制造所谓“阴谋叛乱”事件，企图以此为借口在富利集中营进行一次新屠杀。
    信中说，南越当局最近造谣说，在去年9月27日，富利集中营“检查人员”曾经当场捕获了一个名叫黎文思的所谓“越共干部”正在把切碎的肥皂和香茅拌在煮给“犯人”吃的牛肉里，企图使“犯人”吃后腹疼、泻肚子，并乘此机会煽动“犯人”，掀起波及外界的“骚乱”。
    越南人民军联络代表团在信中指出，南越当局为了替他们将要采取的杀人罪行事先制造舆论，还曾经指令他们的报纸“国家革命报”叫嚣什么“必须坚决惩办上述恶行”；在今年1月底，在富利集中营周围还经常响起威胁集中营里的“犯人”和附近居民的步枪、轻机枪和重机枪的声音。
    信中进一步指出，南越当局为了扩建富利集中营的牢房和添置最新式的刑具，曾从去年的预算中给这个集中营增拨了一千一百万元。南越当局已经和正在继续把南越各个集中营里的成千名政治犯押送到富利集中营去。这一切都证明南越当局正在加紧进行新的阴谋活动。
    越南富利惨案人民调查委员会也就此事在2月16日发表声明指出，所谓黎文思用肥皂和香茅毒杀集中营犯人的“案件”完全是捏造的。声明列举科学根据来证明肥皂和香茅根本不是毒药，并指出这是吴庭艳集团企图制造新的屠杀事件的卑鄙阴谋。
    越南人民军总司令部联络代表团和富利惨案人民调查委员会都再次要求越南国际委员会立即就1958年“富利惨案”进行调查，并迫使南越当局立即停止继续杀害被非法关在富利集中营里的前抗战人员和爱国人民。
    新华社河内17日电　富利惨案人民调查委员会最近在这里发表声明，驳斥了美国和吴庭艳集团新捏造的一种说法：南越富利集中营中的一个被拘留者企图毒死集中营中的其他被拘留者。
    声明说，南越当局捏造说，富利集中营中有一个被拘留者在把将近一公斤的肥皂和香茅放进被拘留者的食物里时被抓住了。美国—吴庭艳集团指控“越南共产党人”企图谋杀集中营中的被拘留者。
    富利惨案人民调查委员会在声明中指出，这是美国—吴庭艳集团企图掩盖他们所犯的谋杀案的又一个诡计。
    声明说，美国—吴庭艳集团千方百计地消灭他们在1958年12月1日在食物中放毒以致杀害一千多名富利营中的被拘留者的罪证。
    声明要求越南国际委员会迅速对富利集中营大屠杀进行实地调查，因为美国—吴庭艳集团正在阴谋利用他们法西斯性质的1959年第十号法令和特别军事法庭来谋害现在被拘留在富利集中营的爱国者。声明说，吴庭艳集团的喉舌一直在叫嚣“无情惩办共产党人”。
    早些时候，富利惨案人民调查委员会曾经把它的两份调查报告送交国际委员会。
