Take This Step Well, Prepare for the Next Step
Chen Zhiyan

When taking the first step, think about the next step and prepare for it; when executing the plan for the first month, first quarter, or first year, think about the next month, next quarter, or next year, and while focusing on current production, also focus on preparations for the next stage of production. This is a working method and leadership method that every enterprise leader must master.

In the new stage of socialist construction—the stage of high-speed development of the national economy—it is even more important to take this step well and prepare for the next one simultaneously. If, when taking the first step, we do not consider how to take the second step but instead carelessly finish the first step before thinking about the next, we will inevitably spend some time researching, deploying, and preparing for the next stage of work after the first step is completed. The continuity between the two steps will be interrupted, and we will have to pause before moving forward, which will waste time and delay the speed.

The working method of looking at the second step while taking the first step has special importance for modern enterprises. Because the production process of a modern enterprise is a complex process with close interconnections, if any link is slightly loosened, the entire chain will be affected. If we do not "prepare for a rainy day" and see the next step from the previous step, we may be caught off guard when encountering new problems, leading to disconnection.

Those with some knowledge of chess know that the most important way for every highly skilled chess player to win is to have already determined the path for the next move or the next two moves when making this move. One of the secrets for every experienced and mature commander to achieve victory lies in their ability to see the further development trend of the battle and make all necessary preparations for the next battle.

From this, it can be seen that the working method of looking at the second step while taking the first step is a method of striving for initiative. Its essence lies in: firmly grasping the current work while making full preparations for the next step. This means not fighting unprepared battles, so that we can proactively and continuously rise step by step.

The benefits of looking at the second step while taking the first step are easy to understand. But how can we make good use of this working method and leadership method? Seeing the second step is not something that can be seen just by wanting to see it, or seen accurately. The fundamental issue is to have scientific foresight. Foresight means understanding the problems existing in the development of things, that is, contradictions. This requires every leader to treat their work with a dialectical perspective. When production is booming, we must also see the contradictions hindering further production growth. That is to say, we must see both its unified and balanced aspects, as well as the opposing and unbalanced aspects that have emerged or may emerge. After the contradiction is recognized, measures must be taken in a timely manner, which is also the specific content of what we call making full preparations. Today, this newspaper publishes the news that Anshan Iron and Steel is grasping the current production while also vigorously grasping preparations for raw materials, fuel, maintenance, and transportation. This is because continuous great leaps in production have resulted in some imbalances in raw materials, fuel, maintenance, and transportation. If these tasks are not grasped early, the continued leap in steel production in the next step will be hindered.

Thus, looking at the second step while taking the first step is not just a simple working method, but a matter of political sensitivity, a matter of applying materialist dialectics in practical work. Looking at the second step while taking the first step requires us to understand and master the objective laws of the development of things, and on this basis, give full play to subjective initiative, promptly and quickly solve new problems arising in production, and continuously make full preparations for continuous leaps forward.

From the perspective of current industrial production, we must seize February, but we must immediately prepare for March. We must seize the first quarter, but we must actively make full preparations for the second quarter. In this way, we will prepare reliable conditions for monthly red, quarterly red, and yearly red, and we will surely complete and over fulfill the magnificent plan for continued leaps in 1960!

### 走好这一步，准备好下一步

    走好这一步，准备好下一步
    陈之衍
    在走头一步的时候，就想到下一步，为走下一步作好准备；在执行头一个月、头一季、头一年计划的时候，就要想到下一个月、下一季、下一年，在抓当前生产的同时就要抓下一步的生产准备工作。这是每个企业领导者必须掌握的工作方法和领导方法。
    在社会主义建设的新阶段——高速度发展国民经济的阶段，走好这一步，同时就准备好下一步，就显得更加重要了。如果在走第一步时，不去考虑第二步如何走法，而是满不在乎地走完了再说，那末，这一步走完了，势必又要花一段时间，去研究、部署，准备下一步的工作，以致两步之间的连续性中断，而要停顿一下再前进，这样就会丧失时间，延缓速度。
    走第一步，看第二步的工作方法，对现代企业来说，还有它特殊的重要性。因为现代企业的生产过程，是一个复杂的、相互联系十分紧密的过程，那一个环节稍稍放松一点，整个链条就会受到影响。如果不“未雨绸缪”，从上一步就看到下一步，遇到新问题，就可能措手不及，造成脱节现象。
    对下棋有些常识的人都知道，每一个棋艺高超的人，他的致胜之道，最主要的是在他走这一着棋时，就已看准了下一着、下两着棋的路子。每一个有经验的成熟的指挥员，他获取胜利的一个秘诀，在于他能看到战斗进一步发展的趋向，并且做好了下一步战斗所需要的一切准备。
    由此看来，走第一步，看第二步的工作方法，是一个力争主动的方法。它的精髓在于：狠狠抓紧眼前工作的同时，就已为下一步做好了充分准备。这也就是说，不打无准备的仗，使我们能主动地、连续地步步高升。
    走第一步时就看第二步的工作方法的好处，是不难理解的。可是怎样才能很好地运用这个工作方法和领导方法呢？看第二步，并不是想看就能看到，就能看得准确的。根本的问题是要有科学的预见。所谓预见，就是洞悉事物发展中存在的问题，也就是矛盾。这里要求每个领导者要用辩证的观点来对待自己的工作。当生产蒸蒸日上的时候，也要看到阻碍生产进一步高涨的矛盾。这就是说既要看到它的统一的、平衡的方面，也要看到已经出现或者可能出现的对立的、不平衡的方面。矛盾被认识了以后，就要及时采取措施，这也是我们说的做好充分准备的具体内容。今天本报发表的鞍钢在抓紧当前生产的同时，又大抓原料、燃料、检修、运输等准备工作，这是因为生产的连续大跃进，原料、燃料、检修、运输等已出现了某些不平衡，这些工作如果不及早抓好，下一步的钢铁生产持续跃进就要受到妨碍。
    这样看来，走第一步，看第二步，又不是一个单纯的工作方法问题，而是一个政治敏感的问题，是一个在实际工作中运用唯物辩证法的问题。走第一步，看第二步，要求我们认识和掌握事物发展的客观规律，并且在这个基础上充分发挥主观能动性，及时地、迅速地解决生产中出现的新问题，不断地为持续跃进做好充分准备。
    从当前的工业生产来说，要抓紧2月，但要立即为3月做好准备，要抓紧第一季度，但又要积极为第二季度做好充分准备；这样就为月月红、季季红、全年红准备了可靠的条件，就一定能完成和超额完成1960年继续跃进的宏伟计划！
