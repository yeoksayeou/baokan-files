    New Tasks on the Agricultural Front in Liaoning Province
    Huang Oudong, Second Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and illuminated by the general line, relying on the soaring enthusiasm of the people throughout the province, Liaoning Province's agricultural production, like other aspects of its work in 1959, achieved continued leaps forward on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958.
    According to preliminary statistics, the yield per unit area of grain (including soybeans) in Liaoning Province in 1959 increased by about 20% compared to 1958. Among them, rice production increased most significantly, with a yield increase of more than 80%.
  Due to the expansion of the sown area of cash crops and vegetables, the sown area of grain in 1959 was relatively reduced. However, the total grain output still increased significantly compared to 1958. Five counties, namely Yingkou, Xinbin, Qingyuan, Gaiping, and Andong, and the suburban districts of three cities, namely Shenyang, Fushun, and Andong, have already achieved or exceeded the target of 400 jin per mu (6000 kg per hectare) stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule (Fengcheng and Haicheng counties are also close to the target stipulated in the program). Among them, Yingkou and Xinbin counties reached 569 jin and 525 jin respectively, exceeding the yield level per mu stipulated in the Agricultural Development Program for areas south of the Yellow River and north of the Huai River.
    In terms of non-staple food production, vegetable production has achieved a tremendous leap forward. The total vegetable output for the year reached more than 8.93 million tons, an increase of 179% compared to 1958, with autumn vegetables increasing by two times. The province has basically achieved self-sufficiency in vegetables. Because Liaoning Province has many industries and large cities, the supply of vegetables in the past always relied on the support of the state and brother provinces, which increased the burden on the state and added a lot of trouble to brother provinces. Now the situation is different. Relying on our own production, we have ensured that every household has vegetables to eat and every commune has storage. Even heavy industrial cities like Anshan have not only achieved self-sufficiency but also have a surplus. Meat production has also developed greatly, with the total number of pigs reaching about 5 million, an increase of more than 60% compared to the end of 1958. Poultry reached 20 million. The total output of aquatic products reached 231,100 tons, an increase of 14.6% compared to 1958. The production of industrial raw materials has also increased significantly. The sown area of cotton was slightly reduced due to the adjustment of crop composition and suffered relatively severe natural disasters, but the total output was still close to the level of the extraordinary harvest in 1958. Oil crops also achieved a bumper harvest, and the output of soybeans and peanuts increased significantly. Hemp, silkworms, medicinal materials, reeds, and sugar beets have also developed to a certain extent. Sideline production has also achieved a tremendous leap forward. The total output value of sideline production reached 380 million yuan, an increase of 90.8% compared to 1958. During the autumn harvest, a "small autumn harvest" campaign to collect mountain products, wild fruits, and wild plants was launched throughout the province. More than 700,000 people in the province went to the mountains and collected more than 350 million jin of various wild fruits and wild plants. The total amount purchased increased fivefold compared to 1958, greatly increasing the income of communes and commune members.
    The great achievements made by the agricultural front in Liaoning Province last year are a great victory for the leadership of the Party and the general line; a victory for the people's communes; a victory for implementing the mass line and launching large-scale mass movements; a victory for implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture; and a victory for communist large-scale collaboration.
    Aspire to Greatness, Set Lofty Goals, and Resolve to Achieve Three Major Tasks
    Although Liaoning Province's agricultural production achieved great achievements in 1959, we cannot be satisfied with these achievements. Due to the large number of industrial and mining enterprises and the high proportion of urban population (urban population accounts for 10 million of the province's 25 million population), agriculture needs to provide more non-staple foods, grains, and industrial raw materials. However, the current level of agricultural production cannot meet the needs of rapid economic development and improving the lives of urban and rural people, and the situation of agriculture lagging behind industry has not changed. At present, the agricultural production in Liaoning Province still cannot meet the rapidly growing needs of industrial production and the lives of urban and rural people for some important products such as grain, live pigs, aquatic products, and industrial raw materials such as cotton, hemp, silk, and reeds. In order to rapidly change the situation in which the development of agriculture in Liaoning Province lags behind industry, the First Session of the Second Provincial Party Congress put forward the task to the agricultural front of the province, which is "to solve three problems in a planned and step-by-step manner in a certain period in the future: First, to meet the needs of urban and rural people in the province for non-staple foods; second, to meet the needs of urban and rural people in the province for grain; and third, to continuously increase the raw materials for light industry." We must aspire to greatness, set lofty goals, mobilize the people of the province, rapidly improve agricultural production, and strive to achieve the three major tasks as soon as possible. We have made some preliminary calculations:
    First, non-staple food production:
    Vegetables: Although basic self-sufficiency has been achieved last year, it has not yet fully met the needs. In the future, we should focus on increasing the yield per unit area, increasing the variety of vegetables and the proportion of fine vegetables, and adjusting the supply in the off-season to achieve sufficient quantity, variety, and year-round availability.
    Meat: On the basis of 5 million pigs in the province at the end of 1959, we will strive to double the number in a relatively short period of time to meet the meat needs of urban and rural people. At the same time, cattle, sheep, and poultry should also be greatly developed to greatly increase the supply of meat and eggs.
    Aquatic products: This year, we plan to produce more than 280,000 tons, and the urban population can eat an average of about 20 jin per person.
    Edible oil: According to the needs of people's lives, we must vigorously improve the yield per unit area of various oil crops such as soybeans, peanuts, sunflowers, and sesame, and actively develop woody oil crops such as walnuts to gradually increase the supply of edible oil to urban and rural people.
    Second, grain: According to the consumption of seeds, food rations, and the needs of future industrial and animal husbandry development, the first step should be to strive to achieve basic self-sufficiency, and the second step should be to achieve complete self-sufficiency. In addition to meeting the needs of all aspects in terms of quantity, the proportion of fine grains will be greatly increased. After the grain problem is solved, we can let go of developing industrial raw material production, and at the same time, we can gradually realize the beautiful vision of turning the land into a garden.
    Third, industrial raw materials: The supply of industrial raw materials in Liaoning Province can be roughly divided into the following three categories: (1) Those that need to be solved by the province itself, such as hemp and silkworm cocoons, should achieve self-sufficiency within one or two years; (2) Those that need to be transferred out for export or support the whole country, such as tobacco, should not only consider the needs of the province, but also vigorously support the whole country; (3) A small number of varieties that are difficult for the province to achieve self-sufficiency in the short term should be vigorously developed.
    Cotton: At present, the yield per unit area is very low, and the potential for increasing production is still very large. In the next few years, we should continue to maintain the existing sown area and vigorously improve the yield per unit area.
    Hemp: It is required to double the sown area in the recent one or two years, and the total output should reach more than 70,000 tons to meet the needs of industry, fishery, and the market, and achieve basic self-sufficiency.
    Silkworm cocoons: Liaoning Province is an important base for tussah silkworm production in the country, with an annual output accounting for more than 70% of the country. In the future, we must strengthen leadership and vigorously develop it. At the same time, we must plant a large number of mulberry trees to increase the output of mulberry silkworms, and strive to double or triple the output in a few years to meet the needs of the silk industry.
    Reeds: Liaoning Province has more than 200,000 hectares of reed fields. Due to poor management, the yield is very low, and the potential for increasing production is very large. As long as we can ensure irrigation and apply some fertilizer appropriately, the yield can be greatly increased. In addition, we should make full use of saline-alkali depressions and the surrounding areas of Pingtang Reservoir to develop a large number of new reed fields. Strive to achieve basic self-sufficiency in raw materials for the paper industry in two or three years.
    Tobacco: Liaoning Province is one of the main tobacco bases in the country. The quality of tobacco leaves is good, and some are exported. In the future, we should continue to improve the yield per unit area and the quality of tobacco leaves, give play to the role of the base, and vigorously support the whole country.
    Sugar beets: Liaoning Province's saline-alkali land can be planted, and it has a great development prospect. In the future, we should actively plant them, increase the output, and promote the development of the sugar industry.
    In addition, there are more than 360 kinds of medicinal materials, more than 50 kinds of oil production raw materials, more than 30 kinds of wine-making raw materials, and more than 50 kinds of fiber and paper-making raw materials in the wild plants of Liaoning Province, all of which should be strengthened protection and fully utilized.
    Comprehensive of the above situation, after the three major tasks are realized, both non-staple foods and grains can fully meet the needs of the people of the province, and the supply of raw materials for light industry can also be greatly increased. At that time, agricultural production will increase and harvest every year, industrial production will also develop at a higher speed, the market will be more prosperous, people's lives will be more affluent, there will be reserves of both coarse and fine grains, fish, vegetables, meat and eggs will be fully supplied, and there will be a wide variety of daily-use industrial products with high quality and low prices. As long as we continue to work hard, this beautiful prospect will become the reality of our lives in the near future.
    In order to gradually realize the three major tasks, we have decided to take three fundamental measures.
    Three Fundamental Measures to Achieve the Three Major Tasks
    Harness Mountains, Harness Water, and Control Sand
    The first fundamental measure is to harness mountains, harness water, and control sand. This is the fundamental measure to change the natural appearance of Liaoning Province, and it is also the foundation for changing the appearance of agricultural production. In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, a vigorous movement to harness mountains, harness water, and control sand has been launched throughout the province. A large number of water conservancy projects have been built, and large areas of sandy and barren hills have been greened. This has a major effect on changing the natural appearance and developing agricultural production. However, these achievements are only the beginning of transforming nature, and there is still a long way to go from our great goals. There are still 3.86 million hectares of soil erosion area in the vast mountainous areas, especially in the western mountainous areas, where the mountains are bare, the forests are sparse, the erosion is serious, and the gullies are dense. There are more than 300 large and small rivers in the province, including the Daling River, the Xiaoling River, the Raoyang River, the Yangximu River, and the Liu River. The river water has a large sand content, the riverbed rises year by year, and the river often dries up in spring and floods in summer. The downstream of these rivers is prone to flooding disasters during the flood season. The northwest borders Inner Mongolia, where sand dunes undulate continuously. Due to the lack of forest protection, the climate is dry, and sandstorm disasters are common. There are still more than 36,000 hectares of mobile sand dunes that are seriously harmful, and they have a tendency to move south continuously. The annual rainfall in the province is very uneven, often with spring droughts and summer floods. Natural disasters such as water, drought, wind, and sand seriously threaten agricultural production, and the threat of water and drought disasters is particularly serious.
    To eradicate water disasters and develop water conservancy, we must start from the source and vigorously carry out soil and water conservation. Doing a good job in soil and water conservation can store water, block sediment, slow down surface runoff, reduce the sand content of river water, turn floods into small ones, turn muddy water into clear water, and turn harmful water into beneficial water. Doing a good job in soil and water conservation can also protect the soil and fertilizer. According to actual measurements, in general soil erosion areas, an average of 1.5 centimeters of soil is lost every year, and 2,700 kilograms of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizer are lost per hectare of land. The western mountainous areas have thin soil, which is the result of soil erosion. Doing a good job in soil and water conservation requires planting a large number of trees to increase forest cover. This has an extremely significant effect on maintaining soil and water. The topsoil eroded from farmland without forest protection is more than 180 times that of areas with forest cover. Due to the abundance of forests and grasses in the eastern mountainous areas, there is more water and the water is clearer. Due to the barren mountains and bare ridges in the western mountainous areas, there are many dry rivers. Forests can also prevent wind, fix sand, and protect farmland and pastures. Developing forestry can also provide green manure resources for agriculture. Amorpha fruticosa is the best green manure. From the above facts, it can be seen that harnessing mountains, harnessing water, and planting trees and afforestation directly or indirectly serve agriculture and are of paramount importance to the development of agricultural production. Water conservancy is the lifeline of agriculture, and harnessing mountains is the foundation of harnessing water, and planting trees and afforestation is the foundation of harnessing mountains. Harnessing mountains, harnessing water, and planting trees and afforestation are an organic whole, interdependent and mutually promoting. Therefore, doing a good job in soil and water conservation, vigorously developing water conservancy, and planting trees and afforestation are fundamental issues for developing agricultural production.
    To overcome water, drought, and wind disasters and completely change the natural appearance, we must take huge steps and revolutionary measures to achieve victory. Liaoning Province convened a conference on mountainous area construction and water conservancy work in October 1959, and called on the people of the province to vigorously harness mountains, harness water, and control sand. It is required that in a few years, in terms of harnessing mountains, the mountainous areas should be forested, the slopes should be terraced, and the gullies should be converted into flat land. Under the condition of rainstorms that occur once every 15 to 20 years, the degree of soil not going down the slope, water not coming out of the ditch, and clear water flowing slowly should be achieved. In terms of harnessing water, the plains should be river-netted, the projects should be systematized, and the farmland should be watered. The irrigated area of farmland should be increased to 4 million hectares, accounting for 80% of the cultivated area. The low-lying and flood-prone areas should be completely free from flooding, achieving no disasters from large floods and guaranteed harvests without water. The flood control standards for the Liao River, Hun River, and Taizi River and other major rivers should reach floods that occur once every 100 to 200 years, and no flood disasters should occur. In terms of sand control, all sand wastelands that have not yet been greened should be greened, especially accelerating the control of 34,000 hectares of mobile sand dunes, building large-scale windbreaks and sand-fixing forests, and turning deserts into oases.
    In order to take a decisive step towards transforming nature, in the recent two or three years, we will organize several large-scale mass upsurges in harnessing mountains, harnessing water, and controlling sand. At the same time, we must persist in year-round construction and establish various professional teams.
    By that time, the natural appearance of Liaoning Province will be "no mountain is not green, all water is clear, forest networks are interwoven, river networks are crisscrossed, there is no drought in spring, no flooding in summer, livestock are prosperous, and grains are abundant."
    Establish Commodity Bases
    The second fundamental measure is to gradually establish commodity bases for agricultural products throughout the province, continuously increase the amount of commodities, and improve the commodity rate of agricultural products, so as to better support industrial production and the socialist construction of the country.
    The requirements for establishing commodity bases are: (1) greatly increase the yield per unit area and the total output, and ensure that the output grows steadily. By the time the commodity base is completed, the yield per unit area should be increased by at least one time or more. (2) Increase the commodity rate. Calculated on the basis of communes, the commodity part should account for more than 50% of the total output value. Some agricultural products, such as cotton, hemp, silk, flue-cured tobacco, fruits, and medicinal materials, should be mostly commodities, and some are all commodities. (3) Commodity bases should not only provide a large number of commodities, but also gradually achieve self-sufficiency in grain and feed on the basis of communes or counties, and strive to sell some commodity grain. At present, some areas in Liaoning Province have formed commodity production that is basically for some crops. However, due to the low yield per unit area, the production is not stable enough, and the commodity rate is not high enough, especially some commodity production areas cannot be self-sufficient in grain and feed, which does not fully meet the requirements of commodity bases. We must build qualified commodity bases in the shortest possible time.
    In order to ensure that large and medium-sized cities, industrial and mining areas, and forest areas have sufficient staple and non-staple foods, light industry has sufficient raw materials, and export commodities have a reliable production base, Liaoning Province is prepared to establish the following types of agricultural product commodity bases in a planned manner: 1. Commodity bases for non-staple foods such as vegetables, meat, eggs, and aquatic products; 2. Grain commodity bases; 3. Commodity bases for light industrial raw materials such as cotton, hemp, tobacco, silk, sugar beets, and reeds; 4. Timber commodity bases; 5. Fruit commodity bases mainly for export.
    According to the natural characteristics and production foundation of Liaoning Province, the layout of various agricultural product commodity bases is roughly: establish vegetable commodity bases near large and medium-sized cities. The near suburbs should produce more fine vegetables, and the far suburbs should produce more coarse vegetables. In the middle and lower reaches of the Liao River, in the vast plains from Changtu to Panshan, Yingkou, and Jin County, establish grain commodity bases. This area has fertile soil and moderate rainfall. It used to be the granary of Liaoning Province. In the future, it will produce more commodity grains such as soybeans, rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains. These places are also the commodity bases for green and ramie hemp in Liaoning Province, and hemp production should be continued. The southern hilly areas, including the Liaodong Peninsula, have a mild climate and a long frost-free period. They are good commodity bases for industrial raw materials and export fruits. On the existing basis, we should further develop fruit trees and plant cotton and peanuts. The eastern mountainous areas have been greened, with tussah trees all over the mountains, dense forests, and abundant water and grass resources. Animal husbandry has a great future. It is a major timber production base, and it is also a commodity base for tussah silkworms, tobacco, and animal products. In the western mountainous areas, we should vigorously afforest, green the barren mountains, do a good job in soil and water conservation, develop fruit trees and cotton, and gradually build them into important economic crop production bases and future export fruit commodity bases. In the northwest wind and sand area, we should vigorously plant trees and afforestation, thicken windbreak forest belts, prevent wind and fix sand, protect farmland and pastures, and actively develop cattle and sheep, and build them into ideal animal husbandry bases. In the coastal areas, we should further develop various aquatic products such as fish, salt, and kelp, manage the reed fields well, and build them into commodity bases for aquatic products and reed production. The main grain-producing areas, vegetable-producing areas, and areas rich in wild vegetables and wild herbs have easy access to feed and should gradually become commodity bases for pig production.
    For various commodity bases, we must plan uniformly and arrange comprehensively. The current focus of establishing commodity bases is to first establish them in the suburbs of large and medium-sized cities, state-owned farms, economic crop areas, and communes and counties that can provide a large amount of commodity grain. The remaining communes should also select conditioned production teams and focus on establishing them. When communes support poor teams, they should consciously help them establish commodity bases.
    After the commodity bases are completed, Liaoning Province will present a prosperous scene: the two banks of the Liao River will be granaries with thousands of miles of rice and wheat, guaranteed harvests in drought and flood, and abundant grains; the northwest wind and sand area will become a green field with crisscrossed forest belts, trees covering the sky, abundant water and grass, and cattle and sheep everywhere; the western barren mountainous area will become a new mountainous area with green mountains and clear waters, singing birds and fragrant flowers, fruit trees all over the mountains, and rich products, thereby fundamentally changing the natural appearance of Liaoning Province.
    Marching Towards Agricultural Modernization
    The third fundamental measure is to achieve agricultural modernization as soon as possible.
    The transformation of the entire agriculture includes two major tasks: social revolution and technological revolution. We have basically completed the social revolution. Now we have the organizational foundation of the people's communes and the preliminary foundation of our country's industrialization. We have the conditions to carry out agricultural technological transformation on a large scale. The technological transformation of agriculture is to achieve agricultural modernization. Chairman Mao instructed us: "The fundamental way out for agriculture lies in mechanization." Agricultural mechanization is the core of agricultural technological transformation and the outline of agricultural modernization.
    Liaoning Province has very heavy agricultural production tasks. Since the Great Leap Forward, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery have been developed simultaneously in an all-round way. We feel that there is a shortage of labor everywhere, and the degree of mechanization is still very low. Therefore, accelerating the realization of agricultural mechanization is of particular importance, and the demand for agricultural mechanization is extremely urgent.
    In order to accelerate the realization of agricultural mechanization, the Provincial Party Committee has put forward a plan. According to this plan, in a few years, the basically flat and large cultivated land in the province can be mechanized. Forestry, fishery, animal husbandry, and agricultural and sideline product processing, rural transportation, etc. will also be gradually mechanized. With the great development of agricultural mechanization, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and small-scale power stations will also increase greatly.
    In order to turn this beautiful prospect into reality as soon as possible, we are mobilizing the masses to actively participate in the agricultural technological transformation movement centered on mechanization, and are also grasping land planning and leveling, establishing an agricultural machinery manufacturing and repair network, and planning funds and training technicians.
    To achieve agricultural modernization, especially mechanization, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods and walking on two legs. On the one hand, we actively use modern agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides to continuously arm agriculture; on the other hand, it is more important and more realistic to mobilize the masses more widely and deeply to carry out tool reform on a large scale and produce indigenous chemical fertilizers and indigenous pesticides. At present, there are still a large number of manual tools and animal-powered tools. Vigorously reforming these tools and improving production efficiency and product quality are the most critical measures to ensure a great leap forward in agricultural production this year. Some tools can increase work efficiency by more than one time, even several times or dozens of times, with slight improvements. For example, the grain threshers modified in Panshan and Kuandian and other places last autumn were eight or nine times, or even ten times, more efficient than threshing with stone rollers. Vigorously carrying out tool reform is not only an urgent requirement for current agricultural production, but also an inevitable process for comprehensive mechanization. The current large-scale tool reform is the beginning of agricultural technological transformation. Even after comprehensive mechanization is realized, there will still be some farm work that needs to be operated manually and with simple tools. Therefore, we must continue to deepen the tool reform movement, and improve the labor efficiency of all farm work by more than one time through vigorously reforming agricultural tools, new-style agricultural tools, and water power. In short, we must both see the beginning of the era of agricultural technological transformation, and actively carry out tool reform without waiting for mechanization.
    In order to promote the great development of agriculture, it is also necessary to strengthen agricultural science and technology research, strengthen the leadership of agricultural colleges at all levels, actively run agricultural middle schools, give full play to the role of agricultural scientific research institutions at all levels, and adhere to the direction of experimental research serving agricultural production. At the same time, we must widely carry out mass agricultural scientific research, and under the unified leadership of the commune party committee, establish an agricultural technology extension network with the agricultural technology service station as the core and the participation of peasant soil experts, and constantly discover, summarize, and promote advanced experiences in various places.
    Strengthen Party Leadership and Strive to Achieve the Three Major Tasks
    In order to realize the three major tasks of the agricultural front in Liaoning Province and rapidly change the backward state of agriculture in the province, we must strengthen the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, launch large-scale mass movements, and raise the red banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune even higher, and struggle against all kinds of right-leaning conservative ideas. After the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was publicized and implemented, the spirit of the general line was greatly promoted, and the vast number of rural cadres and peasants were high-spirited and full of fighting spirit. They are determined to break through all difficulties and strive to be upstream in the production and construction to change the face of the countryside; however, there are also some people in our team who do not see the good situation, they exaggerate the difficulties one-sidedly, bow to the difficulties, lack lofty ambitions, and are content with the status quo. Some people think that "it is difficult to be upstream, it is not safe to be downstream, and it is stable to be midstream," and often issue some strange theories, such as "the advanced suffer losses," "the advanced are nervous," and "the only condition theory." The Party requires us to go all out, strive to be upstream, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, but they always walk slowly with an eight-character gait and engage in construction with less, slower, worse, and more expensive methods; the Party requires us to break superstitions, liberate our minds, and establish the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, but they are always timid and hesitant in everything they encounter, and they are afraid to move forward; the Party requires us not to be arrogant in victory and not to be discouraged in failure, but they often feel complacent with a little achievement, and they are discouraged when encountering difficulties. In short, they often complain that the weather and geographical conditions are not good, and are willing to be slaves to nature and cowards and lazy people in the face of difficulties. Therefore, in front of them, even the best conditions and the best opportunities will be reduced or missed due to their lack of enthusiasm and adherence to the old ways. The emergence of right-leaning conservative ideas has its own class roots and cognitive roots. They reflect the short-sightedness, narrow-mindedness, contentment with the status quo, and unwillingness to make progress of small producers. They underestimate the great collective wisdom and strength of the vast masses. Right-leaning conservative ideas exist now and will occur in the future. Therefore, we must often oppose right-leaning, boost enthusiasm, use the method of criticism and self-criticism, promptly commend the advanced, criticize the backward, create an atmosphere in which everyone strives to be upstream and everyone learns from the advanced, so that people will always maintain soaring enthusiasm to promote the high-speed development of agricultural production and construction.

    辽宁省农业战线的新任务
    中共辽宁省委第二书记　黄欧东
    在党中央、毛主席的英明领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，依靠全省人民的冲天干劲，1959年辽宁省的农业生产和其他各方面工作一样，在1958年大跃进的基础上，又获得了继续跃进。
    1959年辽宁省的粮食（包括大豆）单位面积产量，初步统计，比1958年增长了20％左右。其中水稻增产最为突出，单产增加了80％以上。
  由于经济作物和蔬菜播种面积扩大，1959年粮食播种面积相对缩小，但是，粮食总产量仍比1958年增长很多。全省已有营口、新宾、清原、盖平、安东五个县和沈阳、抚顺、安东三个市郊区，粮食单位面积产量，提前超额实现了全国农业发展纲要规定的每市亩四百斤的指标（凤城和海城县也接近了纲要规定的指标）。其中营口和新宾县分别达到五百六十九斤和五百二十五斤，超过了农业发展纲要规定的黄河以南、淮河以北地区的亩产水平。
    副食品生产中，蔬菜生产，实现了特大跃进。全年蔬菜总产量达八百九十三万多吨，比1958年增长了179％，秋菜增加了两倍，全省基本上实现了蔬菜自给。因为辽宁省工业多，大城市多；过去的蔬菜供应，总是靠国家、靠兄弟省的支援，给国家增加了很大负担，给兄弟省添了不少麻烦。现在的情况不同了，依靠自己生产所得，做到了家家有菜吃，社社有储藏；像鞍山这样的重工业城市，不仅做到了自给，而且有余。肉食生产也有了很大发展，生猪总头数达到五百万头左右，比1958年年底增长60％以上。家禽达到二千万只。水产品总产量达到二十三万一千吨，比1958年增长14．6％。工业原料生产也有很大增长。棉花的播种面积因作物构成的调整，略有缩小，又遭受了较重的自然灾害，但是总产量仍然接近于1958年特大丰收的水平。油料作物也获得丰收，大豆、花生产量都大大增加。麻类、桑蚕、药材、芦苇、甜菜等也都有一定程度的发展。副业生产也实现了特大跃进。副业总产值达到三亿八千万元，比1958年增长90．8％。秋收期间，在全省范围内掀起了采集山货野果、野生植物的“小秋收”运动。全省七十多万人上山，共采集各种野果、野生植物三亿五千多万斤，收购总量比1958年增加五倍，大大增加了公社和社员的收入。
    去年一年辽宁省农业战线取得的伟大成就，是党的领导和总路线的伟大胜利；是人民公社的胜利；是贯彻群众路线，大搞群众运动的胜利；是贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”的胜利；是共产主义大协作的胜利。
    树雄心、立大志、决心实现三大任务
    1959年辽宁省的农业生产虽然取得了伟大成就，但不能满足于这些成就。由于工矿多，城市人口比重大（全省二千五百万人口中城市人口占一千万），需要农业提供更多的副食品、粮食和工业原料。而目前的农业生产水平还不能适应国民经济迅速发展和改善城乡人民生活的需要，农业落后于工业的状况还没有改变。目前辽宁省的农业生产，有一些重要产品例如粮食、生猪、水产品以及棉、麻、蚕、苇子等工业原料，仍然不能满足工业生产和城乡人民生活迅速增长的需要。为了迅速改变辽宁省农业发展落后于工业的现状，省二届一次党代表大会向全省农业战线提出了的任务，就是“要在今后一定时期内，有计划、有步骤地解决三个问题：第一，满足全省城乡人民对副食品的需要；第二，满足全省城乡人民对粮食的需要；第三，不断地增加轻工业的原料。”我们必须树雄心、立大志，动员全省人民，迅速提高农业生产，力争尽早地实现三大任务。我们初步算了几笔大账：
    第一，副食品生产：
    蔬菜：去年虽已经实现了基本自给，但还没有做到充分满足需要。今后应着重提高单位面积产量，增加蔬菜品种和细菜比重，调剂淡季供应，做到数量充足，品种多样，四季不缺。
    肉食：在1959年底全省生猪五百万头的基础上，力争在较短时间内翻几番，以满足城乡人民肉食的需要。同时牛、羊、家禽也要有很大发展，大大增多肉、蛋供应。
    水产品：今年计划生产二十八万吨以上，城市人口每人平均可吃二十斤左右。
    食油：根据人民生活的需要，必须大力提高大豆、花生、向日葵、芝麻等各种油料作物的单位产量，并积极发展核桃等木本油料，逐年增加城乡人民食油的供应量。
    第二，粮食：根据种子、口粮消费情况和今后工业、畜牧业发展的需要，第一步应争取达到基本自给，第二步达到完全自给，除数量上满足各方面需要外，细粮比重将大大增加。粮食问题解决后，我们就可以放手发展工业原料生产，同时也可以逐步实现大地园林化的美好远景。
    第三，工业原料：辽宁省工业原料的供应大致有以下三种情况：（1）须由本省自己解决的如麻类、蚕茧等，要在一、二年内做到自给；（2）须外调出口或支援全国的，如烟草，则不能只考虑本省需要，还应大力支援全国；（3）少数品种本省短期难于做到自给的，更应大力发展。
    棉花：目前单位产量很低，增产潜力还很大，近几年内应继续保持现有播种面积，大力提高单位面积产量。
    麻类：要求在最近一、二年内把播种面积扩大一倍，总产量达到七万吨以上，以满足工业、渔业及市场的需要，做到基本自给。
    蚕茧：辽宁省是全国柞蚕生产的重要基地，常年产量占全国的70％以上。今后必须加强领导，大力发展，同时，要大量栽桑，提高桑蚕产量，争取若干年内翻二——三番，以满足丝绸工业的需要。
    苇子：辽宁省苇田面积有二十多万垧，因为管理不善，产量很低，增产潜力很大，只要能够保证灌水，适当施用一些肥料，产量就能大大提高。另外还应充分利用盐碱洼地及平塘水库周围，大量发展新苇田。争取在二、三年内做到造纸工业原料基本自给。
    烟草：辽宁省是全国主要烟草基地之一。烟叶质量好，并有部分出口，今后应继续提高单位面积产量和烟叶质量，发挥基地作用，大力支援全国。
    甜菜：辽宁省的盐碱土地都可种植，很有发展前途。今后应积极种植，增加产量，促进制糖工业的发展。
    此外，辽宁省野生植物中，有药材三百六十多种、制油原料五十多种、酿酒原料三十多种、纤维和造纸原料五十多种，都应加强保护，充分利用。
    综合上面所讲的情况，三大任务实现后，无论副食、粮食都可以充分满足全省人民的需要，轻工业原料的供应也可大大增多。那时，农业生产将年年增产丰收，工业生产也将以更高的速度发展，市场将更加繁荣，人民生活将更加富裕，粗粮细粮都有储备，鱼菜肉蛋充分供应，日用工业品多种多样，物美价廉。只要我们不断努力，这个美好的前景，在不久的将来，就会变成我们生活的现实。
    为了逐步实现三大任务，我们决定采取三项根本措施。
    实现三大任务的三项根本措施
    治山、治水、治沙
    第一项根本措施是治山、治水、治沙。这是改变辽宁省自然面貌的根本措施，也是改变农业生产面貌的基础。几年来，特别是大跃进以来，在全省范围内，开展了轰轰烈烈的治山、治水、治沙运动。兴修了大量的水利工程，绿化了大面积的沙荒秃岭。这对改变自然面貌，发展农业生产有重大的作用。但是这些成就，仅仅是改造大自然的开端，离开我们伟大的目标还有很远的一段距离。广大山区尚有水土流失面积三百八十六万垧，特别是西部山区，童山秃秃，林木稀少，冲刷严重，沟壑密布。全省有大小河流三百多条，其中大凌河、小凌河、饶阳河、养息牧河及柳河等，河水含沙量大，河床逐年增高，春季常常断流，夏季又常常泛滥。这些河流的下游，一到汛期，极易遭受内涝灾害。西北靠内蒙古边缘，沙丘起伏连绵，由于缺乏森林庇护，气候干燥，风沙灾害普遍，为害严重的流动沙丘，尚有三万六千多垧，并有不断南移趋势。全省年降雨量很不均匀，往往春旱夏涝。水、旱、风、沙等自然灾害，严重的威胁着农业生产，水旱灾害的威胁尤为严重。
    要想根除水患，发展水利，必须从源头着手，大搞水土保持。搞好了水土保持，才能蓄住水，拦住泥沙，减缓地表径流，减少河水含沙量，把洪水化整为零，变浑水为清水，变害水为利水。搞好水土保持，也能保住土、保住肥。据实测证明，在一般水土流失地区，每年平均流失土层一点五公分，每垧土地流失氮磷钾肥二千七百多公斤。西部山区土质瘠薄，就是水土流失带来的恶果。搞好水土保持，就必须广植林木，增加森林复被。这对保持水土的作用极其显著，没有森林保护的农田被冲走的表土，要比有森林复被的地方多一百八十多倍。东部山区由于林草丰茂，所以水多水清，西部山区由于山荒岭秃，所以河多干河。森林还能防风、固沙、保护农田和牧场。发展林业还可以为农业提供绿肥资源，紫穗槐就是最好的绿肥。从上述事实可以看出，治山、治水、植树造林都直接或间接地服务于农业，对发展农业生产有头等重要意义。水利是农业的命脉，而治山又是治水的根本，植树造林又是治山的基础。治山、治水、植树造林是一个有机的整体，相互依存，互相促进。因此，做好水土保持、大兴水利、广植林木是发展农业生产的根本问题。
    要战胜水、旱、风灾害，彻底改变自然面貌，必须采取巨大的步骤和革命的措施，才能取得胜利。辽宁省在1959年10月召开了山区建设和水利工作会议，向全省人民提出了大搞治山、治水、治沙的号召。要求在若干年内，在治山方面，实现山区林木化，坡地梯田化，沟壑川台化。在十五年至二十年一遇的暴雨情况下，达到土不下坡，水不出沟，清水缓流的程度。在治水方面，实现平原河网化，工程系统化，耕地水利化。农田灌溉面积增加到四百万垧，占耕地面积的80％。低洼易涝地区全部解除涝害，达到大水不成灾，无水保丰收。辽河、浑河、太子河等主要河流的防洪标准达到一百年到二百年一遇的洪水，不发生洪水灾害。在治沙方面，绿化一切还没有绿化的沙荒，特别要加速对三万四千垧流动沙丘的治理，大造防风固沙林，变沙漠为绿洲。
    为了向改造大自然迈出决定性的一步，在最近二、三年内，组织几次大规模的群众性的治山治水治沙高潮。与此同时还要坚持常年建设，建立各种专业队伍。
    到那时，辽宁省的自然面貌将是“无山不绿，有水皆清，林网交织，河网纵横，春不旱，夏不涝，六畜兴旺，五谷丰登”。
    建立商品基地
    第二项根本措施是在全省逐步地建立农产品的商品基地，不断增加商品量，提高农产品的商品率，以更好地支援工业生产、支援全国的社会主义建设。
    对建立商品基地的要求是：（1）大大提高单位面积产量和总产量，而且保证产量稳定增长。到商品基地建成，单位面积产量至少要提高一倍以上。（2）提高商品率。以公社为单位计算，商品部分应占总产值的50％以上，有一些农产品，如棉、麻、蚕丝、烤烟、水果、药材等，绝大部分都应当是商品，有的全部是商品。（3）商品基地不但要提供大量商品，而且要以公社或以县为单位，逐步做到粮食、饲料自给，并力争出卖部分商品粮。目前辽宁省有一些地区，已经形成了某些作物基本上是商品性生产。但是由于单位面积产量还很低，生产还不够稳定，商品率还不够高，特别是有的商品产区的粮食和饲料还不能自给，尚不完全符合商品基地的要求。我们要在最短时间内，建成符合要求的商品基地。
    为了保证大中城市、工矿区、林区有充足的主副食品，轻工业有足够的原料，出口商品有可靠的生产基地，辽宁省准备有计划地建立下面各类农产品商品基地：1、蔬菜、肉、蛋、水产品等副食品商品基地；2、粮食商品基地；3、棉、麻、烟、蚕、甜菜、芦苇等轻工业原料商品基地；4、木材商品基地；5、以出口为主的水果商品基地。
    根据辽宁省的自然特点和生产基础，各种农产品商品基地的布局大体是：在大、中城市附近建立蔬菜的商品基地，近郊区应多生产细菜，远郊区多生产粗菜。在辽河中下游，从昌图直到盘山、营口、锦县一带的广大平原地区，建立粮食商品基地。这个地区土质肥沃，雨量适中，过去就是辽宁省的粮仓，今后将生产更多的大豆、水稻、小麦、杂粮等商品粮。这些地方又是辽宁省青、洋麻的商品基地，应继续发展麻类生产。南部丘陵地区，包括辽东半岛，由于气候温和，无霜期长，是很好的工业原料和出口水果的商品基地。要在原有的基础上，进一步发展果树，种植棉花和花生。东部山区已经绿化，柞树满山，森林密布，水草资源丰盛，畜牧业很有前途，是主要的木材生产基地，又是柞蚕、烟草、畜产品的商品基地。西部山区，应大力造林，绿化荒山，做好水土保持，发展果树，棉花，逐步建成为重要经济作物生产基地和未来的出口水果商品基地；西北部的风沙区，要大力植树造林，加厚防风林带，防风固沙，保护农田牧场，并应积极发展牛、羊，建成为理想的畜牧业基地。在沿海各地要进一步发展渔、盐、海带等各种水产品，管理好苇田，建成为水产品和芦苇生产的商品基地。主要粮食产区、蔬菜产区及野草野菜丰富的地区，饲料易得，都应逐步成为生猪生产的商品基地。
    对于各种商品基地，必须统一规划，全面安排，当前建立商品基地的重点，首先是在大中城市的郊区、国营农场、经济作物区和能够提供大量商品粮食的公社和县建立，其余各个公社也都应选择有条件的生产队，重点建立。公社在支援穷队的时候，要有意识地帮助他们建立商品基地。
    商品基地建成后，辽宁省将出现一片丰盛的景象：辽河两岸将是稻麦千里、旱涝保收、五谷丰登的粮仓；西北部风沙地区将成为林带纵横、树木蔽天、水草茂盛、牛羊遍地的绿野；西部贫瘠山区将变成青山绿水、鸟语花香、果树满山、物产富饶的新山区，从而使辽宁省的大自然的面貌有一个根本的改变。
    向农业现代化进军
    第三项根本措施是尽速实现农业现代化。
    整个农业的改造，包括社会革命和技术革命两大任务。社会革命我们已经基本完成了，现在有了人民公社的组织基础和我国工业化的初步基础，我们有条件大规模地进行农业技术改造了。农业的技术改造，就是要实现农业的现代化。毛主席指示我们：“农业的根本出路在于机械化”，农业机械化是农业技术改造的核心，是农业现代化的纲。
    辽宁省农业生产任务非常繁重，从大跃进以来，农林牧副渔五业并举，全面发展，处处感到劳动力不足而机械化程度还很低，因此，加速实现农业机械化就有特别重要的意义，对农业机械化的要求极为迫切。
    为了加速实现农业机械化，省委已经提出规划。根据这一规划，若干年内，全省平川大块耕地基本上都可以实现机械化耕种。对于林业、渔业、畜牧业和农副产品加工、农村运输等等也要逐步实现机械化。随着农业机械化的大发展，化肥、农药、小型电站也都将大大增加。
    为了把这个美好的前景尽快地变成现实，我们正在动员广大群众积极参加到以机械化为中心的农业技术改造运动中来，并且抓紧进行土地的规划和平整，建立农业机械制造、修配网和筹划资金、培训技术人员等一系列准备工作。
    实现农业现代化，特别是机械化，必须认真贯彻土洋结合，两条腿走路的方针，一方面积极地用现代农业机械、化学肥料、农药，不断地武装农业；而更重要、更现实的就是要更广泛、更深入地发动群众大搞工具改革，大造土化肥、土农药。目前大量存在的还是手工工具和畜力工具，大力改革这些工具，提高生产效率和产品质量，则是保证实现今年农业生产大跃进的最关键性的措施。有些工具稍加改良，就可以提高工效一倍以上，甚至几倍、几十倍。像去年秋季盘山、宽甸等地改制的脱谷机，都比用石滚子打场提高工效八、九以至十倍。大搞工具改革既是当前农业生产的迫切要求，也是全面机械化的必经过程。当前大搞工具改革就是农业技术改造的开端。就是全面实现机械化之后，也还有一部分农活需要用手工和简单工具操作。因此必须继续深入开展工具改革运动，通过大搞改良农具、新式农具和水动力把全部农活的劳动效率提高一倍以上。总之既要看到农业技术改造时代的开始，又要不坐待机械化而积极进行工具改革。
    为了促进农业的大发展，还必须加强农业科学技术研究工作，加强对各级农业院校的领导，积极办好农业中学，充分发挥各级农业科学研究机构的作用，坚持试验研究为农业生产服务的方向。同时必须广泛地开展群众性的农业科学研究工作，在公社党委统一领导下，建立一个以农业技术服务站为核心，有农民土专家参加的农业技术推广网，不断发现总结和推广各地的先进经验。
    加强党的领导，为实现三大任务而奋斗
    为了实现辽宁省农业战线的三大任务，迅速改变全省农业落后的状况，必须加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，更高地举起总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，同各种各样的右倾保守思想做斗争。党的八届八中全会决议宣传贯彻以后，总路线的精神更加大大发扬，广大农村干部和农民，意气风发，斗志昂扬。他们决心冲破一切困难，在改变农村面貌的生产建设中力争上游；但是，在我们队伍中，也有的人看不见大好形势，他们片面夸大困难，向困难低头，缺乏雄图大志，安于现状，有的人认为“上游难办，下游不安，中游稳当”，常常发出一些怪论，如“先进吃亏论”“先进紧张论”“唯条件论”等等。党要求我们鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义，他们却总是慢吞吞地摆八字步，以少慢差费的办法来搞建设；党要求我们破除迷信、解放思想，树立敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，他们却总是遇事畏首畏尾，顾虑重重，裹足不前；党要求我们胜利不骄，失败不馁，他们往往稍有成绩，就沾沾自喜，遇到困难就垂头丧气。总之，他们往往埋怨天时地利不好，甘愿当大自然的奴隶，作困难面前的懦夫和懒汉。因而在他们面前，再好的条件，再好的时机，都会因为他们的干劲不足和因循守旧而降低作用或坐失良机。右倾保守思想的产生，是有其一定阶级根源和认识根源的，他们反映了小生产者眼光短浅，思想狭隘，安于现状，不求上进的精神状态。他们对广大群众的伟大的集体的智慧和力量估计不足。右倾保守思想现在有，以后还会发生。因此，必须经常地反右倾，鼓干劲，运用批评与自我批评的方法，及时地表扬先进，批评落后，造成一种人人争上游，个个学先进的空气，使人们永远保持冲天的干劲，以促进农业生产建设高速度地发展。
