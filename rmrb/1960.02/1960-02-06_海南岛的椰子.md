    Hainan Island's Coconuts
    By Lü Xiangyou (text and photography)
    In January, while Beijing is still in the grip of a snowy winter, Hainan Island presents a scene of spring, with lush green hills and clear waters everywhere. Various tropical plants thrive in the gentle breezes and drizzle.

    We took a public bus eastward from Haikou City, and after about three hours, we arrived at Qinglan Port. Across the sea lies the land of abundant coconuts – the Jianhua Mountain Brigade of Dongjiao Commune in Wenchang County. We crossed the sea by sailboat, and after a brief voyage, the boundless coconut groves came into view. Tall coconut trees stood upright facing the green ocean, their large leaves swaying in the azure sky. Hidden among the leaves were clusters of coconuts, promising coconut farmers a bountiful harvest.

    "Every part of a coconut tree is a treasure," is how the coconut farmers value coconuts. This evaluation is absolutely true.

    Guided by a deputy party secretary, we entered the densely shaded coconut forest. Here was the Jianhua Mountain Brigade's coconut processing factory. Many women and elderly people were sitting under the coconut trees, weaving ropes. A large pile of thick ropes was stacked in a wooden shed. The deputy secretary said: These are coconut ropes made from coconut fiber. These coconut ropes can tow huge ships in the ocean and are not afraid of seawater erosion, making them the most popular choice for fishermen along the coast.

    Not far from here, a unique creamy fragrance filled our nostrils. Upon closer inspection, we realized it was a coconut oil processing factory. People in the Hainan area often eat this oil, and dishes cooked with coconut oil are particularly fragrant.

    A comrade from the commune's supply and marketing cooperative proudly brought out some soap, soy sauce, wine, and candy, saying, "These are all made from coconuts."

    A coconut seedling planted in the ground begins to bear fruit in six or seven years. The best fully grown coconut tree can yield more than two hundred large coconuts a year. A coconut tree can live for about a hundred years, and by the end of its life, it can produce more than 20,000 coconuts. These coconuts can be used to extract more than 2,000 jin of coconut oil and make more than 1,500 jin of coconut ropes. Finally, it can also provide people with good timber for construction. Even the coconut shell is useful. Coconut pots and coconut bowls with ethnic characteristics are made from coconut shells.

    Before liberation, the vast majority of coconut trees were owned by landlords and rich peasants. The hard-working coconut farmers lived a life of hunger and deprivation. Many coconut farmers, to escape starvation and conscription, left their homes and tearfully bid farewell to their families, sailing across the sea to Southeast Asia to "make a living." Some have not yet reunited with their long-separated families, and some have even lost contact.

    The beautiful coconut groves, due to years of neglect, were overgrown with weeds and vines, turning into a wilderness where even people could not enter, except for fat squirrels.

    After liberation, coconut farmers and coconut groves welcomed a new era. Now, the Jianhua Mountain Brigade has 100,820 coconut trees. Last year, they produced more than 1.5 million coconuts, five times more than the 250,000 coconuts produced in 1955. Some coconut trees yielded more than 240 coconuts, a miracle never seen before. The incomes of the commune members have generally increased with the abundant coconut harvest. In addition to some processing plants, the brigade has also built a new high-quality fertilizer plant with a daily output of 20 tons. They also plan to plant an additional 20,000 coconut trees.

### 海南岛的椰子

    海南岛的椰子

    1月，北京还正是大雪纷飞的严冬，可是海南岛却呈现出一片春天的景象，到处都是青山绿水，各种热带植物正在微风细雨中茂盛地生长着。
    我们从海口市乘坐东行的公共汽车，约三小时，就到了清澜港，隔海相望便是盛产椰子之乡——文昌县东郊公社建华山大队。我们乘帆船渡海，荡漾片刻，那无边无际的椰林首先映入眼帘。高大的椰树向着碧绿的海洋笔挺地站立着，大大的椰叶在蔚蓝色的天空摇摆着，在绿叶掩护下，露出累累的椰子，在向椰农们预示着就要获得的大丰收。
    “椰子树上一身都是宝”，这是椰农们对椰子的评价。这评价是千真万确的。
    在一位党委副书记的引导下，我们走进了椰荫密布的林海。这里有建华山大队的椰子加工厂。在椰树下面坐着许多妇女和老年人正在打着绳索，一所木棚里，堆积着粗大的绳索。副书记说：这就是用椰衣做成的椰缆。这种椰缆能牵引巨轮在海洋中驶行，不怕海水的浸蚀，是沿海一带渔民最爱使用的。
    离此不远的地方，一种特有的奶油香味冲入我们的鼻子，走近才知道，这里原来是椰油加工厂。海南一带人民经常是吃这种油，用椰油煮的菜格外香。
    公社供销部的一位同志，自豪地拿出一些肥皂、酱油、酒和糖果来说：“这都是用椰子做成的。”
    把一棵椰子苗栽到地里，六七年时间，就开始结出椰子来；一棵长成了的最好的椰树，一年能结二百多个大椰子；椰树能活一百年左右，当它结束它一生的时候，能结二万多个椰子，用这些椰子能榨出二千多斤椰油和制成一千五百多斤椰缆，最后还能给人们留下一根供建筑用的好木材。连椰壳也有用，具有民族特色的椰壶和椰碗，就是用椰壳做的。
    解放前，椰树绝大部分归地主、富农占有，辛勤劳动的椰农们，过着食不果腹，衣不蔽体的生活，多少椰农为了逃避饥饿和抓丁，离乡弃井，含泪向亲人告别，乘着小帆船漂出大海去南洋“求生”。有的直到现在还没有和久别的家人团聚，有的连音讯也断绝了。
    大好的美丽的椰树园，由于年复一年的无人管理，杂木、野草丛生，山藤攀绕，竟至变成了一片荒林，有些地方连人都没法进去，倒把松鼠养得又肥又多。
    解放后，椰农和椰林迎接了新的时光。现在建华山大队有十万零八百二十棵椰树，去年一年产椰子一百五十多万个，比1955年的产量二十五万个增加了五倍。有的椰树结了二百四十多个椰子，是过去所从来没有过的奇迹。社员的收入随着椰子的丰收普遍增加了。大队里除了一些加工厂之外，还新建了一座日产二十吨的优质肥料厂。他们还计划增植椰树两万棵。
