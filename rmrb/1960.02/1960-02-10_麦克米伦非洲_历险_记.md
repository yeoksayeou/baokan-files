Macmillan's African "Adventure" in News Lenses
△Macmillan arrived in Accra, the capital of Ghana, on January 6th. UPI reported: "Only one or two hundred people at the airport did not cheer him, and there were almost no people on the eight-mile road to the city."
Macmillan said in Accra that he had come to Ghana to "see, listen, and learn." Ghana's Minister of Education and Information, Bako, expressed hope that Macmillan would "see how Ghana has done more in three years than Britain did in more than a hundred years of rule," and hoped that he would "learn" that there is no racial discrimination in Ghana.
Macmillan left Ghana on January 11th. He "denied" being snubbed, saying he had spent "the most interesting and rewarding" five days in Ghana.

△Macmillan arrived in Nigeria on the 11th. He was utterly disgraceful when he visited the slums of Lagos. Dressed in a neat and crisp gray suit and holding a handkerchief, Macmillan hurriedly walked along Palm Church Street in the central district of Lagos before immediately returning to the car and continuing his visit from inside the car.
On January 14th, in Ibadan, the capital of the Western Region of Nigeria, hundreds of students from the University of Ibadan shouted "Freedom" to demonstrate to Macmillan who came to visit. The demonstrating students also held up signs that read: "Macmillan Go Home." One sign read: "The Commonwealth is a white man's club - Nigeria will withdraw from the Commonwealth - Down with racism." Macmillan was surprised when he saw the sign and said "Oh." Macmillan escaped the students' encirclement with the help of the police.

△Macmillan arrived in Salisbury, the capital of Southern Rhodesia in the Central African Federation, on January 18th in a cold and cheerless atmosphere, and members of the National Democratic Party "welcomed" him with signs protesting the dominion status.

△When Macmillan arrived in Lusaka, the capital of Northern Rhodesia, on January 21st, Africans held demonstrations against British colonial rule, with signs reading "Macmillan, let us get rid of white rule - give us the right to vote."
On the same day, in Ndola, police discovered a bomb in the basement of a hotel where Macmillan was attending a banquet. Demonstrators hung sixteen flags outside the hotel with slogans demanding suffrage, autonomy, and independence. When Macmillan appeared on the balcony of the hotel, about a thousand Africans shouted slogans at him: "Freedom now." Signs also read "We demand secession from the Federation" and so on. Macmillan immediately "put on a stern face" and turned around to go inside.
On this day, in Kitwe, Macmillan also encountered Africans holding up signs.
Kenneth Kaunda, Chairman of the United National Independence Party of Northern Rhodesia, sent a letter to Macmillan on the same day, demanding the dissolution of the Central African Federation.

On January 23rd, Macmillan encountered demonstrators many times while visiting the Kariba Dam in Northern Rhodesia. At Livingstone Airport, Africans shouted "Give Africa freedom now" and waved signs with the words "No hypocrisy."
Due to the discovery of a bomb, Macmillan was terrified in Northern Rhodesia. The number of police was doubled, and they were on guard day and night. On the 24th, Macmillan asked his assistant when praying in the church: "Have no bombs been found today?"

△On January 25th, Macmillan arrived in Nyasaland amidst a chorus of opposition. Crowds held demonstrations and threw stones at Macmillan's car. Macmillan, afraid of the African people's struggle, asked people not to use "threats and violence."
On the same day, Hastings Banda, President of the Malawi Congress Party, submitted a memorandum to Macmillan, demanding that Nyasaland secede from the "Central African Federation" and become independent, and demanding the establishment of a government elected by Africans who constitute a majority in the legislative and administrative bodies and with universal adult suffrage.

△Macmillan arrived in the Union of South Africa on January 27th. Before his arrival, the African National Congress of South Africa called on Africans to hold demonstrations in all occasions Macmillan appeared.
On January 28th, when Macmillan "patrolled" the African residential area in Johannesburg, African women there held a demonstration against him.
In Cape Town and other places, Macmillan encountered crowds demonstrating against him everywhere.

This British Prime Minister, who was unpopular everywhere, ended his visit to Africa on February 5th and returned to Britain in disgrace.

    麦克米伦非洲“历险”记
    △麦克米伦1月6日到达加纳首都阿克拉。合众国际社报道说：“机场上只有一、二百没有对他欢呼的人群，在通往城里的长达八英里的路上几乎没有什么人”。
    麦克米伦在阿克拉发表谈话说，他是到加纳“看、听和学习”的。加纳教育与新闻部长巴科表示希望麦克米伦将“看到加纳如何在三年内比英国统治一百多年时期做更多的事”，希望他“学习”的是在加纳没有种族歧视。
    麦克米伦在1月11日离开加纳。他“否认”受到冷待，说在加纳消磨了“最有趣味和最有收获的”五天。
    △麦克米伦11日抵尼日利亚。他在拉各斯参观贫民窟时丑态毕露。麦克米伦穿着一身整洁笔挺的灰色西装，手中拿着一条手绢，急急忙忙地在拉各斯中区棕榈教堂街走了一下后，马上回到汽车上，然后坐在汽车里继续他的参观。
    1月14日，在尼日利亚西部地区首府伊巴丹，成百名伊巴丹大学的学生高呼“自由”，向前来访问的麦克米伦示威。示威的学生们并举着标语牌，上面写着：“麦克米伦滚回去”。有一块标语牌上写着：“英联邦是一个白人的俱乐部——尼日利亚将退出这个联邦——打倒种族主义”。麦克米伦看到这块标语牌时很吃惊，他“哦”了一声。麦克米伦在警察的帮助下才脱出了学生们的包围。
    △1月18日，麦克米伦冷冷清清地到达中非联邦南罗得西亚首府索耳兹伯里，民族民主党党员举着抗议自治领地位的标语牌“欢迎”他。
    △麦克米伦1月21日到达北罗得西亚首府卢萨卡时，非洲人举行示威反对英国殖民统治，标语牌上写着“麦克米伦，让我们摆脱白人统治——给我们投票权”。
    同天，在恩多拉，在麦克米伦参加宴会的一家旅馆的地下室里，警察发现了一枚炸弹。示威群众在旅馆外面挂出写有要求选举权、自治和独立等口号的十六面旗帜。当麦克米伦出现在旅馆的阳台的时候，有大约一千名非洲人对他大呼口号：“现在就要自由”。标语牌上还写着“我们要求脱离联邦”等等。麦克米伦马上“板起面孔”转身进去。
    这一天，在基特威，麦克米伦也碰到高举标语牌的非洲人。
    北罗得西亚非洲人国民大会主席恩坎布拉当天致函麦克米伦，要求解散中非联邦。
    1月23日，麦克米伦在参观北罗得西亚卡利亚水坝时，又多次碰到示威群众。在利文斯敦机场上，非洲人高呼“马上给非洲自由”，并挥舞着写有“不要虚伪”等字样的标语牌。
    由于发现了一枚炸弹，麦克米伦在北罗得西亚时惶恐不安。警察人数增加一倍，并日夜戒备。24日麦克米伦在教堂作祈祷时问他的助手说：“今天没有发现任何炸弹吗？”
    △1月25日，麦克米伦在一片反对声中到达尼亚萨兰。群众举行示威游行，并向麦克米伦的汽车掷石头。麦克米伦害怕非洲人的斗争，要求人们不要用“威胁和暴力”。
    当天，马拉维国民大会党主席契尔瓦向麦克米伦递交备忘录，要求尼亚萨兰脱离“中非联邦”而独立，并要求建立一个非洲人在立法和行政机构中都占多数以及在一切成年人都有选举权的情况下选出来的政府。
    △麦克米伦1月27日到达南非联邦。在他到达以前，南非非洲人国民大会号召非洲人在麦克米伦出现的所有场合举行示威游行。
    1月28日，麦克米伦在约翰内斯堡的非洲人居住区“巡视”时，那里的非洲妇女向他举行了示威。
    在开普敦和其他地方，麦克米伦到处都碰到向他示威的群众。
    这位到处不受欢迎的英国首相在2月5日结束了他在非洲的访问，灰溜溜地回英国去。
