Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 2nd. Transportation departments and factory enterprise workers in Tianjin concentrated their efforts to carry out a blitz campaign, rapidly achieving mechanization and semi-mechanization of handling and loading. The mechanization level of the city's eleven major railway freight yards increased from the original 9% to 30% to 50% to 90% in just over a month, saving more than 1,500 handling workers and significantly improving transportation efficiency.

With the great leap forward in production, Tianjin experienced a situation where transportation could not keep up with production needs. This was mainly because transportation tools such as automobiles and large vehicles were modern, while handling and loading were manual operations such as lifting, carrying, and shouldering. This not only occupied a lot of manpower and involved high labor intensity, but also resulted in low efficiency and long turnaround times, forming a "fast in the middle, slow at both ends" situation, affecting the completion of transportation tasks. In order to achieve "high transportation to ensure high production, increasing production without increasing manpower," the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China strengthened its leadership over transportation work. Technical revolution committees or offices were established from the municipal and district levels to the grassroots units, headed by the secretaries of the Party committees at all levels, to formulate plans for achieving mechanization and semi-mechanization of handling and loading, and make thorough arrangements.

The first blitz campaign began in mid-December last year, focusing on five units including the Western Freight Yard, Western Station, Northern Station Freight Yard, and Xingang Operation Area, which are the main cargo distribution centers in Tianjin. Leading cadres went deep into the freight yards, adopted the "three-combination" method, mobilized the masses to make great efforts in technical innovation, and manufactured handling and loading machinery. After ten days of effort, mechanization and semi-mechanization of handling and loading were achieved. Among them, the loading and unloading machinery of the Western Freight Yard, which has the largest cargo throughput in the city, increased from the original 32 units to 175 units, and the degree of mechanization increased from 9% to 95%. The Xingang Operation Area realized coordinated operations of handling and loading machinery. In the past, it took 72 hours to load a 10,000-ton coal ship, but now it only takes 24 hours, and the number of handling workers has been reduced by three-quarters compared with the past. Subsequently, in the second blitz campaign lasting six days, six more units with larger freight volumes in the city achieved loading and unloading mechanization and semi-mechanization. Currently, the third blitz campaign is vigorously underway in fifty-one factories and enterprises. From December last year to mid-January this year, employees of various units have put forward more than 153,000 innovation proposals, of which more than 50,000 have been implemented, and more than 800 sets of bamboo board conveyors, belt conveyors, crab claw unloader, double-opening car troughs, large and small cranes, automatic weighbridges, and other machines in more than 50 varieties have been manufactured, increasing handling and loading efficiency by an average of more than 50%.

Various units conscientiously implemented the principle of "using foreign methods if possible, using indigenous methods if foreign methods are not possible, combining foreign and indigenous methods, and gradually improving" put forward by the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, adhering to the principle of self-reliance, fully utilizing the rich experience and wisdom of handling and loading workers, overcoming technical and material difficulties, and manufacturing handling and loading machinery to arm themselves using "foreign machinery and indigenous manufacturing methods." For example, Jiang Shouchong, an old handling worker from the No. 1 State-owned Cotton Factory, saw during the blitz campaign that many belt conveyors were fixed up, down, left, and right, and were not flexible. Based on the principle that car front wheels can turn left and right, after painstaking research, careful observation, analysis, and design, he used scrap iron pipes to manufacture a universal conveyor that can turn up, down, left, and right.

In the blitz campaign, large-scale collaboration also played an important role. The technical strength and technical level of various freight yards and docks in Tianjin were relatively weak. During the campaign, Tianjin City and various districts organized freight yards, docks, factories, and various transportation departments to implement "technical revolution one-stop" collaboration. For example, under the leadership of the Technical Revolution Committees and offices of the Hebei District Committee and the Hongqi District Committee, the Northern Station and Western Station freight yards united various relevant units, supported each other, learned from each other's strengths and made up for each other's weaknesses, preventing the phenomenon of each doing their own thing, not coordinating with each other, and duplicating efforts. This large-scale collaboration solved the problems of materials, manpower, and technology that many units could not solve on their own.

(From our newspaper in Nanning on the 2nd) The workers of Wuzhou Port in Guangxi made great efforts in technical innovation. All fifty-two docks in the port basically achieved soil mechanization and mechanization of loading and unloading within thirty days. At the docks handling main cargoes such as coal and grain, the coal mining machines, cabin exit machines, and air grain suction machines were connected into serialized mechanical loading and unloading lines by belt conveyors. At present, the average loading and unloading efficiency of the port has increased by 3.8 times compared with manual operation, and the labor force has been reduced from 2,200 in the past to 1,400, and the berthing time of ships has been reduced from 2.21 days in the past to 0.97 days. The Ministry of Communications attaches great importance to the experience of Wuzhou Port in achieving loading and unloading mechanization, and recently held a national exchange meeting here on advanced experience in loading and unloading machinery in small and medium-sized ports.

Wuzhou Port is located at the confluence of the Xijiang River and the Wujiang River in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and is an important transfer port in the Pearl River Basin, connecting the upper and lower reaches. With the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production and construction, the port's throughput last year has increased from 750,000 tons in 1953 to 2.07 million tons, and the throughput will continue to increase significantly this year. In the past, the cargo's exit from the cabin, up and down the shore, stacking and unstacking all relied on workers carrying on their shoulders on steep slopes of 50 to 60 meters long, which not only occupied a large number of labor forces, but also had low loading and unloading efficiency, and the ship's berthing time accounted for more than 60% of the operating time.

In order to quickly change this situation, the Wuzhou Prefectural Committee and the Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, in addition to mobilizing citizens to rush loading and unloading, based on the principle of "indigenous first, then foreign, small first, then large," first carried out technical transformation of ten main cargo docks. After half a month of hard work by employees of the shipping bureau and related factories and mining enterprises, ten wooden rail electric cable cars were successfully put into production, and the efficiency was more than ten times higher than manual operation. Subsequently, the city set off a wave of enthusiasm for advancing towards dock mechanization. Due to the wide difference in water level in the upper and lower reaches of the Xijiang River, heavily loaded ships must undergo a large number of transfers at Wuzhou Port. After Wuzhou Port achieved loading and unloading mechanization on both sides of the dock, it strived to achieve mechanization of river center operations in order to comprehensively improve the throughput capacity of the entire port. The Party Committee of the Ship Repair Factory led employees to build bridge cranes in the heart of the river. They didn't have complete drawings, so they held a "Zhuge Liang Plan Presentation Meeting." Cadres, workers, and technicians studied and worked together, and after ten days of hard work, they finally made the crane. Now, bridge-type electric cranes stand in the heart of the river, and various indigenous and foreign loading and unloading machinery are arranged on docks on both sides, replacing the crowds of people carrying on their shoulders. The four huge "iron hands" of the belt conveyor at the Fumin No. 1 dock extend directly into the hold, automatically and evenly scooping the coal onto the belt, and sliding it through the 101-meter belt into various coal trucks under the funnel. The Native Produce Company of the Lijiazhuang dock uses a native roller shutter chain plate conveyor to transport more than 30 tons of materials per hour from the bottom of the 52-meter bank. At the Juren dock, employees of the Vegetable Company have used animal-powered wooden cable cars to unload and transport fresh vegetables.

    天津高速度革新装卸工具
    十一个主要铁路货场的装卸机械化程度一个多月内提高了数倍
    梧州港五十二个码头实现装卸土机械化和机械化，工效提高三倍多
    新华社天津2日电　天津市交通运输部门和工厂企业的职工集中力量开展突击运动，高速度地实现了搬运装卸机械化和半机械化。全市十一个主要铁路货场的机械化程度，在一个多月内，由原来的9％至30％提高到50％至90％，共节约搬运工人一千五百多名，运输效率显著提高。
    随着生产的跃进，天津市出现了运输赶不上生产需要的状况，这主要是由于汽车、大车等运输工具是现代化的，而搬运装卸却是抬、背、扛等手工操作，不仅占用人力多，劳动强度大，而且效率低，时间长，形成“跑在中间、慢在两头”的局面，影响到运输任务的完成。为了做到“高运保高产，增产不增人”，中共天津市委加强了对交通运输工作的领导，从市、区到基层单位都成立技术革命委员会或办公室，由各级党委书记挂帅，制定了实现搬运装卸机械化、半机械化的规划，作出了周密部署。
    去年12月中旬开始了第一次突击运动，以天津主要货物集散地西货场、西站、北站货场、新港作业区等五个单位为重点，领导干部深入货场，采取“三结合”的办法，发动群众大闹技术革新，制造搬运装卸机具，经过十天的努力，就实现了搬运装卸机械化和半机械化。其中，市内货物吞吐量最大的西货场的装卸机具，由原来三十二台增加到一百七十五台，机械化程度由9％提高到95％。新港作业区实现了搬运装卸机具联合作业，过去要七十二小时才装一条万吨煤船，现在只用二十四小时，而搬运工人比过去减少了四分之三。接着，在第二次突击运动的六天内，又有六个市内货运量较大的单位实现了装卸机械化和半机械化。目前第三个突击运动正在五十一个工厂、企业蓬勃开展。从去年12月到今年1月中旬为止，各单位职工共提出革新建议十五万三千多件，已实现五万多件，制造了竹板传送机、皮带运输机、蟹爪散装机、汽车双开马槽、大小吊车、自动磅秤等五十多种八百多件，使搬运装卸效率平均提高一倍半以上。
    各单位认真贯彻中共天津市委提出的“能洋就洋，不能洋就土，洋土结合，逐步提高”的方针，本着自力更生为主的原则，充分发挥搬运装卸工人的丰富经验和智慧，克服技术、材料上的困难，用“洋机械、土造法”的办法制造搬运装卸机具来武装自己。如国棉一厂老搬运工人姜守忠，在突击运动中看到许多皮带式传送机上下左右都是固定的，不灵活，就根据汽车前轮能左右转动的原理，经过苦心钻研、仔细观察分析设计，利用废铁管制造出能上下左右转动的万能传送机。
    在突击运动中，大协作也起了重要作用。天津各货场、码头的技术力量和技术水平比较薄弱，天津市和各区在运动中就组织货场、码头、工厂和各运输部门实行“技术革命一条龙”协作。如北站、西站货场，在河北区委、红旗区委技术革命委员会和办公室的领导下，把各有关单位统一起来，互相支援，取长补短，防止了各搞一套、互不配合、彼此重复的现象。这种大协作，使许多单位自己无法解决的材料、人力、技术等三方面的问题迎刃而解。
    本报南宁2日电　广西梧州港职工大闹技术革新，全港五十二个码头在三十天内都基本上实现了装卸土机械化和机械化。在吞吐煤、粮等主要货物的码头，还由皮带机把打煤机、出舱机、空气吸谷机连成了系列化的机械装卸线。目前，全港平均装卸工效比人工操作提高了三点八倍，劳动力由过去的二千二百人减少为一千四百人，船舶停港时间由过去的二点二一天减少为零点九七天。交通部很重视梧州港实现装卸机械化的经验，最近在这里召开了全国中小港口装卸机具先进经验交流会议。
    梧州港位于广西僮族自治区西江与梧江的会合点，为珠江流域中承上接下的重要中转港口。随着工农业生产建设的飞跃发展，去年港口的吞吐量已由1953年的七十五万吨上升为二百零七万吨，今年吞吐量将继续大量增加。过去货物的出舱、上下岸、堆垛和拆垛，全靠工人在五、六十米长的陡坡上肩挑背负，不但占用了大批劳动力，而且装卸效率低，船舶停港时间占营运时间的60％以上。
    为了迅速改变这种状况，中共梧州地委、市委除了发动市民突击装卸外，根据“先土后洋，先小后大”的原则，首先对十个主要货运码头进行技术改造。经过航运局及有关厂矿企业职工的半月奋战，十条木轨电动缆车顺利投入了生产，效率比人工操作提高十倍多。接着，全市又掀起了向码头机械化进军的热潮。由于西江上下河道水位相差悬殊，重载船舶必须在梧州港进行大量中转，梧州港在两岸码头实现装卸机械化以后，又力争江心作业机械化，以全面提高全港通过能力。船舶保修厂党委领导职工在江心建造桥式吊车。他们没有完整的图纸，就开“诸葛亮献计会”，干部、工人和技术员共同研究，共同努力，经过十天苦战，终于制成了吊车。现在，江心矗立着桥式电动吊车，两岸各个码头排列着各种土、洋装卸机具，代替了肩挑背负的人群。富民一号码头的皮带运输机四只巨大的“铁手”一直伸入船舱，自动均匀地将煤扒上皮带，通过一百零一米的皮带溜入漏槽下的各种运煤车。李家庄码头土产公司使用土卷帘式链板运输机，每小时从五十二米的岸下运上三十多吨物资。在居仁码头，蔬菜公司职工已用畜力木制缆车卸运鲜嫩蔬菜。
