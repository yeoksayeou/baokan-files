Xinhua News Agency, Livingston, February 16th: The British "Monckton Commission," which is strongly opposed by the people of Central Africa, arrived in Livingston, Northern Rhodesia, on the 15th, led by British Conservative Party Member of Parliament Monckton, to begin a three-month so-called "investigation" of Central Africa.

The British government established this commission to find new ways to maintain the "Federation" and continue British colonial rule over Central Africa, in the face of strong opposition from the people of Nyasaland and Rhodesia to the white colonial rule of the "Central African Federation."

British Prime Minister Macmillan openly stated during his recent visit to Africa that the establishment of the "Monckton Commission" was not intended to "destroy the Federation" but to "guide it on how to develop better."

The commission consists of twenty-six people, only five of whom are Africans. Even these five Africans were appointed by the British Governor.

Before the "Monckton Commission" arrived in Central Africa, the people of Central Africa had already launched a wave of boycotts.

    企图寻找维持殖民统治的新方法
    英“蒙克顿委员会”到中非
    新华社16日讯　利文斯敦消息：遭到中非人民强烈反对的英国“蒙克顿委员会”，在英国保守党议员蒙克顿的率领下，15日到达北罗得西亚的利文斯敦，开始对中非进行为时三个月的所谓“调查”。
    英国政府成立这个委员会的目的，是为了在尼亚萨兰和罗得西亚人民强烈反对“中非联邦”白人殖民统治的情况下，去中非寻找保持这个“联邦”和继续维持英国对中非进行殖民统治的新方法。
    英国首相麦克米伦最近访问非洲时就曾经公开说过，成立“蒙克顿委员会”不是为了“破坏联邦”，而是去“指导它如何才能更好地发展”。
    这个委员会由二十六人组成，其中只有五名非洲人。就是这五名非洲人，也是由英国总督指定的。
    在“蒙克顿委员会”到达中非之前，中非人民已经掀起了抵制的浪潮。
