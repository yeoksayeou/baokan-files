Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 11th: As the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance approaches, Moscow has been holding report meetings, soirees, joint celebrations, and exhibitions almost every day in enterprises, government offices, and schools.

On the evening of the 10th, the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, the Institute of Chinese Studies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the Oriental Studies Department of the Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and the House of Friendship with Peoples of Foreign Countries jointly held a soiree here to warmly celebrate the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance.

Hundreds of Soviet sinologists, cultural and art workers, and students attended the soiree. Mei Lanfang, head of the delegation of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Zhang Yingwu, counselor of our embassy in the Soviet Union, and representatives of Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union, who came to participate in the celebrations for the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty, were also invited to attend the soiree.

On the rostrum of the soiree was written in Chinese and Russian: "Long Live the Infrangible Friendship and Cooperation Between the Peoples of the Soviet Union and China - A Powerful Bastion of World Peace." Zhu Yeva, Vice-Chairman of the Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the host of the soiree, said at the meeting that the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Soviet-Chinese Treaty of Friendship is a common festival for the peoples of our two countries. The Soviet-Chinese Friendship Treaty demonstrates the great power of friendship and alliance between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China to the whole world. The unbreakable friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China is a manifestation of the unity of the peoples of the two countries. The unity of the peoples and parties of our two countries is in line with the interests of world peace.

When talking about the achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction, Zhu Yeva said that we are very happy about the great victory achieved by the Chinese people in socialist construction. This victory was achieved under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, its Central Committee, and Comrade Mao Zedong. We extend warm brotherly greetings to the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party.

Professor Oshanin, a famous Soviet sinologist, and some comrades who had visited China, spoke at the meeting, expressing their joy at the achievements made by the Chinese people in the past ten years.

Mei Lanfang was also invited to speak, and he conveyed the cordial greetings of the Chinese people to the brotherly Soviet people to the participants of the soiree. He said that in the past ten years, the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples has been unprecedentedly consolidated and strengthened. It is of great significance and makes us feel excited to celebrate the tenth anniversary in these days when the East wind is prevailing and the West wind is declining.

At the soiree, famous artists from the Soviet Grand Theater and primary school students studying Chinese performed programs.

On the evening of the 9th, the All-Soviet Correspondence Institute of Technology held a celebration meeting.

Potapov, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the "Soviet-Chinese Friendship" magazine, made a report at the meeting. Two professors from the college who visited China last year talked about their impressions of the visit and praised the increasingly consolidated Soviet-Chinese friendship.

Staff members of our embassy and students studying in the Soviet Union attended the soiree.

From the 12th, Moscow cinemas will screen fourteen Chinese feature films such as "The Wind from the East" and "Letter from the Front", and nineteen Chinese documentaries such as "Little Road in the Dense Forest" and "The Great Sun Yat-sen". Many Chinese films will also be screened in the capitals of various republics recently.

Radio and television broadcasts in Moscow have featured programs about China every day these days.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 10th: To celebrate the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union held a joint celebration with the working people of Moscow in the afternoon of the 10th. The joint celebration was held in the newly built embassy building on Lenin Hills.

More than 300 representatives of the working people of Moscow and Moscow Oblast attended the joint celebration.

At the beginning of the joint celebration, Liu Xiao, Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, spoke. Ambassador Liu Xiao said: In the past ten years, on the basis of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Alliance, our two countries have carried out the closest cooperation in political, economic, cultural and other fields, which has greatly promoted the prosperity and development of our two countries.

Ambassador Liu Xiao said: The Sino-Soviet Friendship Alliance is an alliance for peace. Our two countries have been constantly working hard to strengthen peace-building and defend the common cause of world peace. In our common cause, our strength is growing day by day, and our unity is being strengthened day by day.

Ambassador Liu Xiao said that the people of our country resolutely support the efforts made by the Soviet people to ease the situation.

He said that, however, imperialism is still unwilling to see the easing of the international situation, and is continuing to carry out "peace" conspiracies and strengthen its arms race activities. In particular, the recent signing of a military alliance treaty between US imperialism and Japanese militarism is a dangerous action aimed at China and the Soviet Union and endangering peace in the Far East and the world. We cannot but be highly vigilant about this. Imperialism also vainly attempts to undermine Sino-Soviet unity, but any conspiracy of imperialism to provoke and undermine the unity of our two countries will surely suffer a more shameful defeat. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Alliance is eternal and unbreakable, and will continue to develop and consolidate in our common cause.

Kurkin, a worker from the Likhachev Automobile Factory in Moscow, Kortitina, a young milkmaid from the Michurin Collective Farm in Moscow Oblast, and Kutafin, secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee of Moscow University, spoke on behalf of Soviet workers, peasants, youth, and students at the meeting.

Kurkin said that the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed ten years ago has consolidated the friendship between China and the Soviet Union. The Sino-Soviet alliance is a powerful factor in defending world peace. The Sino-Soviet alliance has played and will continue to play a huge role on the international stage.

Odintsov, First Secretary of the Stupino City Committee of Moscow Oblast, presented Ambassador Liu Xiao with a congratulatory letter and gifts on behalf of the working people of Stupino.

The delegation of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association headed by Liu Changsheng and staff members of the embassy attended the joint celebration.

At the joint celebration, the guests and hosts toasted to Sino-Soviet friendship and to the health of the leaders of the two parties and governments.

Chinese artists and participants in Soviet workers' amateur cultural activities performed wonderful programs at the meeting.

The joint celebration was conducted in an extremely warm and friendly atmosphere.

Prior to this, Major General Pan Zhenwu, Military Attaché of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, held a reception
