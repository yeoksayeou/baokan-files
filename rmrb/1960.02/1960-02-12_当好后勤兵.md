Blossoms of the Great Leap Forward smile and welcome spring,
Thousands of troops and horses are busy with spring plowing.
Financial and economic departments go to the front,
Supporting the great spring plowing campaign,
Production materials are prepared completely,
Resolutely being a good quartermaster.

    当好后勤兵
    跃进花朵笑迎春，
    千军万马闹备耕。
    财经部门把阵上，
    支援春耕大进军，
    生产资料准备齐，
    坚决当好后勤兵。
