A few good paintings from the PLA Art Exhibition
　　Cao Zhenfeng
After seeing the Second Fine Arts Exhibition of the People's Liberation Army, I felt very excited and deeply educated. This exhibition, through various forms of works, concentratedly and prominently demonstrated the fearless heroic spirit and revolutionary optimism of the People's Liberation Army in combat life and socialist construction, and inherited and carried forward the fine tradition of combativeness and mass character of serving the soldiers by facing the company and facing the masses in creation. In front of these art works, I was often attracted by a strong artistic charm, and I watched them over and over again, really reluctant to leave. Here I would like to talk about a few good paintings that touched me the most.
　　Yang Liezhang, a first-class combat hero of the Navy and a sergeant, created the traditional Chinese painting "Long Live the Great Leap Forward," which is an outstanding work in the exhibition. In the painting, a sailor, stepping on the evergreen pine tree, facing the滔滔sea, and on the towering mountains, is carving the five characters of "Long Live the Great Leap Forward". The author did not stick to the general true description, but boldly and enthusiastically expressed the heroic spirit of the heroic Chinese people with the spirit of revolutionary romanticism. Han Ke's "Crossing the Sea to Fight," Liu Qing's "Delivering Meals," Zhang Youpei's "The Great Wall Beyond the Border," and Lang Zhuohong's "Rescuing Fishermen" and other works, from various aspects, showed the heroic nature of the People's Army and the invincible heroic spirit. The emergence of these works is not accidental, it is mainly due to the author's incomparable trust in the Party and unlimited loyalty to the people.
　　Recruit Dai Jinfa's mural sketch "Double Happiness" is a good work with a unique sense of humor and ingenious conception. The soldiers and his lover in the picture each hold half of the double happiness, one side is a five-good pacesetter, and the other is a labor model. Together, they are matched with a poem: A pacesetter is one happiness, a model worker is one happiness, happiness upon happiness, matched into a double happiness. The painting is full of revolutionary optimism and enthusiastically praises the new style and new qualities of the new society. Another example is the projectionist Wang Shouquan's woodcut "Rehearsing a Play" and the student Zhang Jieyu's cartoon "I Laugh While Dulles Cries", which all show the rich creative genius of the masses. Their works are so solid, the path is so broad, and the steps are so firm and powerful!
　　Liu Qing's oil painting "First Shooting" is a good work with a strong atmosphere of life and educational significance. It portrays a new soldier who participated in shooting for the first time. Because his shooting results were not good enough, he felt a great deal of blame in his heart. He was unwilling to lag behind, and he might have even shed a few tears because of this. There are many soldiers like this in the army. They are full of vigor and actively strive for progress. In learning and training, they study diligently and practice hard. They will never give up until they achieve excellent results and win the "full house red" for the class and platoon. Beside the new soldier, the squad leader patiently comforted him like an elder, encouraged him, and found out the reasons for the failure. The image of the squad leader is well portrayed, with the amiable demeanor of a veteran soldier. The audience can fully believe from this painting that this lovely new soldier will never be discouraged because of this. With the help of the veteran soldier, he will definitely become a strong soldier proficient in martial arts.
　　Xiang Ergong and Xu Lin's "Morning at the Coastal Defense Post" is also an outstanding work, showing the life of the coastal defense soldiers who have been guarding the peaks of high mountains all year round. The author cleverly integrates the characters with the surrounding environment, and uses clear and concise tones to express the magnificent scenery of the coastal defense front, making the entire picture full of poetic feeling and inspiring people's love for the magnificent mountains and rivers of the motherland and for the coastal defense soldiers.
　　Hu Tilin's oil painting "Orphan" touched me even more, not only because I had such a life experience, but because the work has a strong artistic appeal. I think the scene it depicts will also move every audience. In a corner of the shelter, a Chinese volunteer soldier, leaning diagonally on the edge of the kang, is concentrating on sewing something in the dim light. Beside him, two Korean orphans are sleeping peacefully. In the depths of the painting, the night sky with the huge light of a searchlight passing through the door is revealed. The author cleverly handled the contrast between two contradictions in this painting, which more powerfully strengthened the theme and gave people more aftertaste. Looking at the atmosphere of the entire picture, it makes people feel so quiet that they seem to be able to hear the children's light breathing and murmured dreams... All of this constitutes a peaceful and happy night scene: it seems that the children have never been ravaged by war, and have not experienced the suffering brought to them by the American aggressors, but are sleeping on a warm kang in peaceful days. But in fact, it is just the opposite. This is not a peaceful night, but a night of war. It is not a night of happiness and fantasy, but a night when countless peaceful people are suffering from aggression. After a moment of calm, there may be the roar of shells and bombs. In addition, the characterization and plot arrangement are also very successful. The author uses the contradictory contrast between peace and war and the vivid characterization to more profoundly explain the heroic essence and great internationalist spirit of the People's Army.

    解放军美展的几幅好画
    曹振峰
    看过解放军第二届美术展览之后，使我感到十分兴奋，也使我受到很深的教育。这次展出，通过各种不同形式的作品，集中而突出地表现了解放军在战斗生活和社会主义建设中，无畏的英雄气概和革命的乐观主义精神，而且在创作上继承和发扬了面向连队，面向群众，为兵服务的战斗性和群众性的优良传统。我在这些美术作品面前，常常被一种强烈的艺术魅力所吸引，使我看了又看，真是流连忘返。这里我想谈谈几幅使我最感动的好画。
    海军一等战斗功臣、中士杨列章的国画“大跃进万岁”，是展览中突出的作品。画中一个水兵，脚踏着万古常青的松树，面对着滔滔的大海，在巍然屹立的大山上，正在雕凿“大跃进万岁”五个大字。作者没有拘泥于一般的真实的描写，而是大胆的、热情的、以革命的浪漫主义精神表现了英雄的中国人民豪迈的气魄。韩柯的“渡海作战”，柳青的“送饭”，张幼培的“塞外长虹”，郎卓红的“抢救渔民”等作品，从各个方面，表现了人民军队的英雄本色和所向无敌的英雄气概。这些作品的出现并不是偶然的，它主要是由于作者对党的无比信赖，对人民无限的忠诚。
    列兵戴金发的壁画草图“双喜”是一幅别有风趣、构思巧妙的好作品。画中的战士和他的爱人各拿双喜的一半，一面是五好标兵，一面是劳动模范，对到一起，配诗写道：标兵一个喜，模范一个喜，喜上又加喜，配成一双喜。画里充满了革命的乐观主义精神，非常热情地歌颂了新社会的新风尚和新品质。又如放映员王寿泉的木刻“排戏”，学员张颉羽的漫画“我笑杜勒斯哭”等作品，都表现了群众丰富的创作天才。他们的作品是那么坚实，路子是那么开阔，步子又是那么坚强有力！
    柳青的油画“第一次射击”是一幅具有浓厚生活气息和教育意义的好作品。它刻划了一个初次参加射击的新战士，由于射击成绩不够好，内心受到很大的责备，他不甘心落后，可能还因此落了几滴泪哩。像这样的战士，在部队中是很多的，他们生气勃勃、积极上进，在学习和训练中，勤学苦练，不达到优秀的成绩，不取得班排的“满堂红”，决不罢休。在新战士的身旁，班长像长辈一样耐心地安慰他，鼓励他，给他找出失败的原因。班长的形象刻划得很好，具有老战士和蔼可亲的风度。观众从这幅画中完全可以相信，这位可爱的新战士，决不会因此而气馁，在老战士的帮助下，定能成为武艺精通的坚强战士。
    项而躬、徐琳的“海防哨所的早晨”也是突出的作品，表现了长年守卫在高山之巅的海防战士们的生活。作者巧妙地把人物与周围的环境有机地融合成一体，用清晰、简练的色调表现出海防前线的壮丽景色，使整个画面诗情洋溢，能激发人们对祖国壮丽的山河、对海防战士的热爱。
    胡悌麟的油画“孤儿”更加使我感动，这不仅是因为我有过这样的生活经历，而是作品有着强烈的艺术感染力。我想，它描绘的情景同样会使每一个观众所感动。在掩蔽部的一角，一个中国志愿军战士，斜挎在炕沿上，对着昏暗的灯光聚精会神地缝着什么，在他的身旁，安祥地睡着两个朝鲜孤儿。在画的深处，从门口透出划过探照灯巨光的夜空。作者在这幅画中巧妙地处理了两个矛盾的对比，更有力地加强了主题，给人以更多的回味。从整个画面的气氛上看，使人觉得是那么静，似乎能听到孩子轻轻的呼吸，喃喃的呓语……这一切都构成了一片和平幸福的夜景：好像孩子们未曾受过战火的摧残，没有经历美国侵略者带给他们的苦难，而是在和平的日子里，睡在烧暖的火炕上。但事实上恰恰相反，这不是和平的夜，而是战争的夜，不是幸福和富有幻想的夜，而是无数和平的人民遭受侵略的夜，在片刻平静之后，可能接着便是炮弹和炸弹的轰鸣。另外，在人物刻划和情节安排上，也是很成功的。作者就是运用了和平和战争的矛盾对比和人物的生动刻划，更深刻地阐明了人民军队的英雄本质和伟大的国际主义精神。
