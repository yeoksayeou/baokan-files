    Not a Small Matter Either
    For many years, burnt-out light bulbs have been considered useless waste. Now, with filament replacement and reproduction, they can be "brought back to life." This matter may seem small, but its significance is great.
    Light bulbs are essential materials for both production and construction, as well as people's daily lives. In recent years, the production of light bulbs has greatly developed. However, due to the continuous Great Leap Forward in China's industrial and agricultural production and the ever-improving living standards of the people, especially the rapid development of the electricity industry, the demand for light bulbs has greatly increased. On the other hand, a large number of light bulbs are discarded every year. According to estimates by relevant departments, last year alone, approximately 90 million light bulbs were discarded nationwide due to filament burnout, equivalent to more than 70% of the actual annual supply. If 50 million of these could be recycled and reproduced into finished products, it would be equivalent to the output of the Shanghai Yaming Lamp Factory, currently China's highest-producing lamp factory, for a year and a half. Therefore, the successful trial of old light bulb filament replacement not only opens up a new avenue for increasing the source of light bulbs and ensuring supply but also provides a good way to utilize waste materials and save the country a large amount of valuable materials. It is particularly worth pointing out that building the country with diligence and thrift, and running all undertakings with diligence and thrift, is our long-term policy for building socialism. Greatly promoting diligence and thrift, and fully utilizing all possible waste and old materials, embodies this spirit. From this perspective, old light bulb filament replacement is not a small matter either.

    也不是小事
    多少年来，断了钨丝的电灯泡都成了废物，现在可换丝复制，使它“起死回生”了。这件事虽小，意义很大。
    电灯泡是生产建设和人民生活所必需的重要物资之一。几年来，电灯泡的生产有了很大发展。但由于我国工农业生产的持续大跃进和人民生活的日益提高，特别是电力工业的迅速发展，对电灯泡的需要量大大增加。另一方面，每年又有大量的灯泡废弃。据有关部门估算，仅去年全国就大约有九千万只电灯泡因断丝废弃，相当这一年全年实际供应量的70％以上。如果将其中的五千万只回收复制，变成成品，就等于我国目前产量最高的上海亚浦耳电灯泡厂一年半的产量。因此，复制旧灯泡试验成功，一方面为增加电灯泡的货源、保证供应开辟了一条新道路，同时也是利用废物，给国家节省大量贵重材料的一个好办法。特别值得指出的是，勤俭建国，勤俭办一切事业，是我们建设社会主义的长远的方针，大大提倡克勤克俭，充分利用一切可能利用的废旧物资，正体现了这种精神。由此看来，旧灯泡换丝复制，也不是小事。
