    Cultivating Scientific Talent Quickly, Effectively, and Economically
    Two Shanghai Research Institutes Cultivate a Group of Research Backbone Personnel
    Their experience is: First, combine trial production of new products, learning basic theory, and technical practice; second, learn from experienced experts, teachers, and workers outside the institute; third, learn while teaching others.
    (Our report) The newly established Computing Technology Research Institute and the Electronics Research Institute of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, relying on the assistance of technical forces from factories and universities, have been building while doing and learning. In one year, they have trial-produced electronic computers and various electronic instruments, cultivating a group of scientific research cadres quickly, effectively, and economically, laying the foundation for the establishment of the institutes.
    These two research institutes began preparations after October 1958. Most of the research and technical cadres were high school and junior high school students, demobilized soldiers, and radio repair workers transferred from the commercial sector. There were only a few university students and individual engineering technicians, as well as young teachers from universities. The equipment in the research institutes was also extremely lacking. However, they displayed a high degree of revolutionary drive, relying on the technical strength and material support of Shanghai factories and schools, and in one year, they initially mastered the latest technology in these two scientific fields. Now, both research institutes have their own laboratories, and the Electronics Research Institute has also built its own experimental factory, basically possessing the conditions for independently conducting experimental research work.
    A large number of young research and technical personnel in these two research institutes have grown rapidly while working and learning, becoming the backbone of the work. Take the magnetic core group of the Computing Technology Research Institute as an example: the magnetic core is an indispensable component for manufacturing high-speed electronic computers, and the process technology requirements are very high. This group has a total of eleven people, including five undergraduates, four high school students, and two demobilized soldiers with junior high school education. In the past, none of them understood the theory in this area. In the past year, under the guidance of factory technicians, they sent people to learn from fraternal units in Beijing while working and learning in the factory. As a result, they not only learned to manufacture magnetic core components, but also created a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, and self-made precision magnetic core testers. Now they can work independently.
    The fundamental reason why these two research institutes have achieved such great success in a short period of time is the victory of the Party's General Line. In the early days of the institutes' establishment, conditions in all aspects were very poor. Some people advocated learning the theory first and then starting to work, without rushing to take on tasks. The Party leadership organizations of the two research institutes organized everyone to speak freely and debate. After debate, they resolutely chose the path of actively starting work and overcoming difficulties through learning while doing. They realized that it was unrealistic to wait for the state to train talents before establishing research institutes, or to wait for themselves to learn well before starting work. They considered that Shanghai has many universities and factories that could cooperate and provide assistance. Therefore, they resolutely implemented the policy of "building, learning, and working simultaneously" put forward by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China.
    Learning while doing, learning in the process of researching and trial-producing products, combining trial production of new products, learning basic theory, and technical practice, and paying special attention to the study of basic theory and improving the theoretical level in repeated practice. This is one of the important experiences of the two research institutes in training scientific research cadres over the past year. For example, when the Computing Technology Research Institute was trial-producing electronic computers, it organized all personnel in the institute to systematically study computer principles, pulse technology, and other related courses. The Electronics Research Institute organized general technical personnel in the institute to study radio engineering, while allowing scientific and technical personnel with university degrees to study electronics in the research class of East China Normal University.
    The second experience of training scientific research cadres is to use all opportunities to learn from experienced experts, teachers, and workers outside the research institute. Since its establishment, the Computing Technology Research Institute has invited teachers from Fudan University and researchers from fraternal units in Beijing to give lectures at the institute. When encountering difficulties in processing technology during the trial production of electronic computers, they consulted veteran workers at the wired communication factory, and also invited more than a dozen master craftsmen from related factories throughout the city to serve as technical instructors, solving the difficulties in the trial production.
    Continuously summarizing experience and combining doing, learning, and teaching, learning on one's own while teaching others, this is another important experience of the Computing Technology Research Institute in training cadres. They paid attention to summarizing the successful and failed experiences of each step in the trial production process, writing them into written materials, teaching them to newcomers, and helping schools and newly established fraternal units in other places train cadres.
    Recently, the two research institutes formulated their work plans for 1960, deciding to continue to vigorously grasp the work of training cadres, and while completing the research tasks assigned by the state, doing everything possible to improve the scientific research level of the cadres.

    多快好省地培养科学人材
    上海两个科学研究所培养了一批研究骨干
    他们的经验是：一，把试制新产品、学习基本理论和技术实践三者结合起来；二，向所外有经验的专家、教师和工人学习；三，一面自己学，一面教别人
    本报讯　中国科学院上海分院新建立的计算技术研究所和电子学研究所，依靠工厂、高等学校技术力量的协助，边干、边学、边建，在一年间，试制出来电子计算机和多种电子仪器，多快好省地培养了一批科学研究工作干部，打下建所的基础。
    这两个研究所都是在1958年10月以后开始筹建的，大多数研究技术干部是高初中学生、复员军人和商业部门转业来的收音机装修业的职工，只有少数大学生和个别工程技术人员、高等学校的青年教师。研究所里的设备更是十分缺乏。但是，他们发挥了高度的革命干劲，依靠上海工厂、学校的技术力量和物质上的支援，一年之间，就初步掌握了这两项科学事业的最新技术。现在，这两个研究所都已经有了自己的实验室，电子学研究所还建起了自己的实验工厂，基本具备了可以独立进行试验研究工作的条件。
    这两个研究所的大批青年研究技术人员边干边学迅速成长起来，成了工作中的骨干。以计算技术研究所的磁芯组为例：磁芯是制造快速电子计算机必不可少的元件，工艺技术要求非常高。这个组共十一人，其中有五个大学肄业生，四个高中生，两个具有初中文化程度的复员军人。过去，他们谁都不懂这方面的理论。一年来，他们在工厂技术人员指导下，一面派人到北京兄弟单位学，一面在厂里边干边学。结果，他们不仅学会制造磁芯元件，而且创造了土洋结合的方法，自制出精密的磁芯测试仪。现在他们已经能独立工作。
    这两个研究所能够在短期内取得这样大的成绩，根本的原因是党的总路线的胜利。建所初期，各方面条件都很差。有人主张先学好理论，再动手干，不必赶接任务。两个研究所的党的领导组织大家鸣放，经过辩论，坚决选择了积极上马、从边干边学中去克服困难的道路。他们认识到，等待国家培养出人材才办研究所以及等待自己学好了再动手干，都是不切实际的。他们考虑，上海有很多的高等学校和工厂，可以协作，可以得到帮助。于是，他们坚决贯彻执行了中共上海市委提出的“边干、边学、边建”的方针。
    边干边学，在研究试制产品的过程中学，把试制新产品、学习基本理论和技术实践三者结合起来，并特别重视对基本理论的学习，在反复实践中提高理论水平。这是两个研究所一年来培养科学研究干部的重要经验之一。如计算技术研究所在试制电子计算机时，先后组织全所人员系统学习了计算机原理、脉冲技术等有关课程。电子学研究所一面在所内组织一般技术人员学无线电工学，一面让具有大学程度的科学技术人员到华东师范大学研究班进修电子学。
    他们培养科学研究干部的第二条经验是：利用一切机会，向研究所外有经验的专家、教师和工人学。计算技术研究所建立以来，先后请过复旦大学教师和北京兄弟单位的研究人员到所讲课。试制电子计算机在加工技术上遇到了困难，他们向有线电厂的老工人请教，还从全市有关工厂中请来十多个老师傅担任技术指导，解决了试制中的难题。
    不断总结经验，把做、学、教三者结合起来，一面自己学，一面教别人，这是计算技术研究所培养干部的另一条重要的经验。他们注意总结试制过程中每一步成功的和失败的经验，写成文字材料，教给新来者，帮助学校以及外地新建的兄弟单位培养干部。
    最近，两个研究所制定了1960年的工作规划，决定继续大抓培养干部工作，在完成国家交给的研究任务的同时，千方百计地提高干部的科学研究水平。
