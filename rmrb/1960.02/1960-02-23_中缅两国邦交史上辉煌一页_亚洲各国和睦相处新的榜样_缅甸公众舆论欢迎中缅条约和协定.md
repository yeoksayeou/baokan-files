Rangoon Air Dispatch from Our Newspaper: The signing of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the agreement on the Sino-Burmese boundary issue has brought great joy to the Burmese people. People from all walks of life in Burma unanimously believe that the signing of this treaty and agreement not only marks a new stage in the friendly relations between China and Burma, but also sets a new example for cooperation and harmonious coexistence among Asian countries. Burmese Minister of Culture U Chit Thoung said: "From now on, Sino-Burmese friendship will be further developed and consolidated." The famous Burmese patriotic poet Thakin Kodaw Hmaing wrote a poem entitled "China, Our Good Neighbor": "Beijing! Beijing! Through endless cycles, I am destined to be with you. With a golden heart, I visit you, I admire you, we wholeheartedly bow in reverence."

Burmese newspapers and public opinion have recently published editorials and articles, warmly welcoming the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Sino-Burmese Boundary Agreement signed by the Prime Ministers of the two countries, believing that this is a victory for the people of China and Burma and a victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Referring to the signing of the two agreements, "The Voice of the Peacock" stated that this should be attributed to the foresight and broadmindedness of the governments of China and Burma, and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence signed by U Nu and Zhou Enlai, and should also be attributed to Prime Minister Ne Win and Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China for facilitating the agreement on these issues, because they have written a glorious page in the history of Sino-Burmese relations. The newspaper also said that Burma's resolution of a historical issue with a large country is a very honorable measure and achievement internationally. On the other hand, it is also a demonstration of China's sincere generosity, lack of aggressive ambitions, and peaceful coexistence with its neighbors towards small and weak countries, thus powerfully defeating foreign slander.

The Burmese people believe that the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Agreement fully demonstrates the common desire of the governments and peoples of China and Burma to break free from the net imposed on the two countries by imperialism and to live together amicably on a new basis. "The Nation" stated: "China and Burma have historically been close neighbors. The so-called boundary issue only arose after British colonialists ruled Burma, because imperialism imposed its unreasonable demands, and the weak Asian countries were forced to submit under British imperial power. In 1947, the British Empire signed the Sino-Burmese border agreement with the then Kuomintang government of China, but Britain forcibly seized the Meng-Mao triangular area as its permanently leased area. Now the Sino-Burmese border agreement stipulates that the three regions of Pianma, Gulang and Gungfang are returned to China, while the Chinese government uses the Banghong and Banglao tribal areas as an exchange condition, ceding the Meng-Mao triangular area to Burma. This is extremely fair and reasonable, and neither side suffers."

Various democratic parties and people's organizations in Burma have also successively issued statements supporting the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Boundary Agreement. They unanimously believe that China and Burma are both peace-loving countries with no fundamental conflict of interest. The signing of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression is a major blow to the US imperialist plot to create antagonism among Asian countries.

### 中缅两国邦交史上辉煌一页  亚洲各国和睦相处新的榜样  缅甸公众舆论欢迎中缅条约和协定

    中缅两国邦交史上辉煌一页
    亚洲各国和睦相处新的榜样
    缅甸公众舆论欢迎中缅条约和协定
    本报仰光航讯　中缅友好和互不侵犯条约以及两国边界问题协定的签订，给缅甸人民带来了极大的喜悦。缅甸各阶层人士一致认为，这个条约和协定的签订，不仅标志着中缅两国的友好关系进入了一个新阶段，并且为亚洲各国的合作与和睦相处树立了一个新的榜样。缅甸文化部长吴漆东说：“从此，中缅友谊将获得进一步地发展和巩固。”缅甸著名的爱国诗人德钦哥都迈以“中国，我们的芳邻”为题写下了这样的诗篇：“北京！北京！我轮回转迁，我与你有缘，怀着一颗金心，访问你，瞻仰你，我们一心一意叩首虔诚。”
    缅甸报纸和公众舆论最近连续发表社论和文章，热烈欢迎中缅两国总理签订的中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和中缅边界问题协定，认为这是中缅两国人民的胜利，是和平共处五项原则的胜利。谈到两个协定的签订，“孔雀之声报”说，这应归功于中缅两国政府有远见，胸襟广阔，及吴努、周恩来签订的中缅和平共处五项原则，并应该詀誉于促使这些问题达成协议的奈温总理和中华人民共和国周恩来总理，因为他们在中缅邦交史上写上了辉煌的一页。这家报纸还说，缅甸和一个大国家解决了历史上的悬案，在国际上来说是一项十分荣誉的措施和成就。另一方面也是中国对弱小国家真诚宽大、没有侵略野心，以及和邻邦和平共处的示范表现，因而强有力地击败了外来的诬蔑。
    缅甸人民认为，中缅边界问题协定的签订，充分表明了中缅两国政府和人民具有摆脱帝国主义强加于两国身上的罗网，在新的基础上友好相处的共同愿望。“联邦报”说：“中缅两国在历史上一向是亲密相处的邻国，所谓边界问题只是在英国殖民者统治缅甸后才产生的，因为帝国主义强词夺理，亚洲各弱小国家在英帝强权下被迫屈服，1947年英帝曾和中国当时的国民党政府签订中缅边界协定，但英国强夺猛卯三角地区为它的永租地区。如今中缅边界协定规定片马、古浪和岗房三个地区归还中国，而中国政府以班洪部落和班老部落地区作为交换条件，把猛卯三角地区让给缅甸，这是极其公平合理的，双方都不吃亏。”
    缅甸各民主党派和人民群众组织也相继发表声明，支持中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和边界问题协定。他们一致认为，中缅两国都是爱好和平的国家，没有根本的利益冲突，中缅友好和互不侵犯条约的签订，是对美帝国主义制造亚洲国家相互对立阴谋的一个重大打击。
