Niudu Commune Builds Wells on a Large Scale to Tap Underground Water Sources
    Taiyuan "59 Power Drilling Machine" Increases Drilling Efficiency by More Than Twenty Times

    (Our Newspaper) News - The Niudu Commune in Linyi, Shanxi Province, actively taps underground water sources and builds wells on a large scale, successfully completing the "One Dragon" water conservancy project, turning 100,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields.

    The "One Dragon" water conservancy project of the Niudu Commune involves building sixteen powered wells and excavating four man-made rivers with a total length of sixty li in the Sushui River bend, which runs through the entire Niudu Commune. Boiler-turbine machines and water pumps are installed on the wells to draw three cubic meters of water per second from the ground. In addition to ensuring that the 57,000 mu of farmland in the Sushui River bend are regularly irrigated, this project also diverts water southward through man-made rivers, turning 50,000 mu of dry land in Wangle, Taifan, Guocun, and other places into paddy fields.

    Since the beginning of winter, after the commune party committee thoroughly investigated the strata and water sources along the Sushui River bend and proposed a plan to build the "One Dragon" water conservancy project, it immediately won the support of the commune members. From late October of last year, under the leadership of the "One Dragon" water conservancy project construction committee, headed by the first secretary of the commune party committee, a construction team of 2,300 people was organized to begin the "One Dragon" water conservancy construction project in the entire Sushui River bend. Past experience has pointed out the direction for the development of water conservancy in the Niudu Commune: it is necessary to store surface water and tap underground water sources; it is necessary to have large and medium-sized canals and small-sized wells. Only in this way can we ensure that water conservancy projects benefit in the same year and exert greater effects. Therefore, in the construction process, the commune members were full of energy and high spirits, and the progress of the project was greatly accelerated. The original plan was to complete it in fifty days, but as a result, it only took forty days, and the entire project was completed ahead of schedule. By mid-December, "One Dragon" had been installed. When the water was tested, the roaring waves flowed southward, and the wheat fields were filled with water in an instant. Within a short period of six days, 5,000 mu of wheat fields were irrigated.

    Xinhua News Agency News - Taiyuan County, Shanxi Province, has successfully trial-produced the "59 Power Drilling Machine," which can increase drilling efficiency by more than twenty times.

    The "59 Power Drilling Machine" was modified from the old-style "56 Well Tool" by the Chengguan Commune in Taiyuan County, the County Agricultural Construction Bureau, the County Vehicle Factory, and the Wood Factory. Most of the machine body is made of wood, and ordinary carpenters can modify it in just two or three workdays. It only costs about ten yuan to modify such a drilling machine.

    The "59 Power Drilling Machine" is driven by a 3- to 5-horsepower electric motor. Where there is no power supply, it can be driven by a diesel engine, boiler-turbine machine, etc. It is easy to use and the operation technique is simple. Its advantages are speed and high efficiency. In the past, using the "56 Well Tool" to drill a machine-irrigated well six or seven zhang deep usually required twenty-four strong laborers working in shifts day and night, and it took thirty to forty days to complete. Using the "59 Power Drilling Machine" only requires three or four ordinary laborers working in shifts, and it can be drilled in six days, increasing efficiency by twenty to twenty-five times.

    牛杜公社大建水井挖掘地下水源
    太谷“59动力打井机”提高打井效率二十多倍
    本报讯　山西省临猗牛杜公社积极挖掘地下水源，大建水井，胜利完成了“一盘龙”水利工程，使十万亩旱地变成水田。
    牛杜公社的“一盘龙”水利工程，是在贯穿牛杜公社全境的涑水河湾，兴修十六个机井和修凿四条共长六十里的人造河。在井上安装锅驼机和水泵抽水，每秒从地下抽出三公方的水。这项工程除保证涑水河湾五万七千亩农田经常得到灌溉外，并且通过人造河引水南浇，使王了、太范、郭村等地的五万亩旱地也变成水田。
    入冬以来，当公社党委详细勘查了沿涑水河湾的地层、水源，提出兴修“一盘龙”水利工程方案后，立刻得到社员的拥护。从去年10月下旬，在公社党委第一书记挂帅的“一盘龙”水利工程兴建委员会领导下，组织了一支二千三百名的建设队伍，在整个涑水河湾开始了“一盘龙”的水利建设工程。过去的经验给牛杜公社指出了发展水利的方向，既要储蓄地上水，又要挖掘地下水源；既要有大中型的河渠，也要有小型的水井。只有这样，才能保证水利工程当年受益，并且发挥更大效用。因此，在施工过程中，社员个个干劲足，情绪高，工程进度大大加快，原计划五十天完成，结果只用了四十天，整个工程就提前结束了。到12月中旬，“一盘龙”已安装好。当试验放水时，滔滔的巨浪滚滚南流，一块一块的麦田，顷刻之间水流满畦。短短六天内即浇麦田五千亩。
    新华社讯　山西省太谷县试制成功了“五九动力打井机”，能提高打井效率二十多倍。
    “五九动力打井机”是太谷县城关公社和县农业建设局、县营车辆厂和木制厂等单位利用旧式“五六井工具”改制成的。机体大部分是木制的，普通木匠只要两三个工就可以改制出来。改制一部这样的打井机，只需十元左右。
    “五九动力打井机”用三至五马力的电动机带动，没有电源的地方可用柴油机、锅驼机等带动，使用轻便，操作技术简单。它的优点是速度快，效率高。过去用“五六井工具”打成一眼六、七丈深的机灌井，通常需要二十四个强壮劳力日夜轮班操作，三十到四十天才能完成，用“五九动力打井机”只需要三、四个一般劳力轮班操作，六天就可以打成，效率提高二十到二十五倍。
