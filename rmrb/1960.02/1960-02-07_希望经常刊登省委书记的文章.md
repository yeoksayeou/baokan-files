    Hope to Regularly Publish Articles by Provincial Party Secretaries
    Since the beginning of 1960, many First Secretaries of Provincial Party Committees have taken time out of their busy schedules to write many educational articles for us. This has greatly helped us to further understand the current excellent situation and future tasks. For example, Comrade Wu Zhipu's "Studying Comrade Mao Zedong's Works" gave me great inspiration. In the future, I will definitely study Chairman Mao's works seriously, use Mao Zedong Thought to arm my mind, and guide my study and work. I hope that the First Secretaries of Provincial Party Committees can often publish articles in the newspaper in the future.

    Recently, we have received many letters from readers expressing their love for reading articles by the First Secretaries of Provincial Party Committees and hoping that the newspaper will regularly publish articles by them. This is a very good suggestion, and we will continue to organize responsible comrades from provincial and municipal Party committees to write articles to meet readers' expectations for the newspaper.

    希望经常刊登省委书记的文章
    1960年的开始，就有不少省委第一书记在百忙中抽出时间给我们写了许多有教育意义的文章，这对我们进一步地认清当前的大好形势和今后的任务有很大帮助。例如吴芝圃同志写的“学习毛泽东同志的著作”，就给了我很大的启发。今后我一定认真地学习毛主席的著作，用毛泽东思想来武装自己的头脑，指导自己的学习、工作。希望今后省委第一书记能经常在报纸上发表文章。

    最近一个时期，我们收到不少读者来信，表示非常爱读省委第一书记的文章，希望报纸经常发表省委第一书记的文章。这个意见很好，我们将继续组织省市委负责同志写文章，以满足读者对报纸的期望。
