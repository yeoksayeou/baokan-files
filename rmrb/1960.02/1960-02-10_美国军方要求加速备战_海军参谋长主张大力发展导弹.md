Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch from Washington: The U.S. Chief of Naval Operations, Burke, requested the United States to accelerate the development of nuclear submarines capable of launching "Polaris" intermediate-range missiles while testifying before the House Appropriations Subcommittee. According to testimony released yesterday by the U.S. Congress, Burke complained to the committee that the United States is currently building these submarines too slowly. He said that at the current rate, it would take fifteen years to build as many missile submarines as needed to maintain America's "dominant position."

He requested that $975 million be allocated to the Navy in the 1961 fiscal year to build six more nuclear submarines capable of launching "Polaris" intermediate-range missiles in addition to the original plan (which was for three submarines). Burke revealed that because it is currently impossible to significantly increase the speed of building these submarines, the U.S. Navy is even considering equipping a batch of merchant ships or other similar vessels with equipment to launch the aforementioned missiles. In addition, the Navy is also making provisions to install launchers for these missiles on modernized cruisers.

Burke clamored that in addition to preparing for all-out war, the United States must step up preparations for "limited wars." He said the U.S. Navy is currently unable to cope with more than two "small conflicts" simultaneously. He believes that the United States cannot simultaneously conduct military operations like those the United States engaged in in Lebanon and the Taiwan Strait in 1958.

    美国军方要求加速备战
    海军参谋长主张大力发展导弹
    新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：美国海军作战参谋长伯克在众议院拨款小组委员会作证时要求美国加速发展能发射“北极星”式中程导弹的核潜水艇。根据美国国会昨天发表的证词，伯克向委员会抱怨美国目前建造这种潜水艇的速度太慢。他说，按照目前的速度，需要十五年的时间才能建造出保持美国“优势地位”所需要的那么多的导弹潜水艇。
    他要求在1961财政年度内拨给海军九亿七千五百万美元，以便在原来计划以外多建造六艘能发射“北极星”式中程导弹的核潜水艇（原计划为三艘）。伯克透露，由于目前无法大大提高建造这种潜艇的速度，美国海军甚至在考虑在一批商船或其他类似的船只上装备发射上述导弹的设备。此外，海军还正在作出规定，准备在现代化的巡洋舰上装置这种导弹的发射器。
    伯克叫嚷美国除了准备全面战争以外，必须加紧准备“有限战争”。他说美国海军目前无法同时应付两个以上的“小冲突”。他认为，美国无法同时进行像1958年美国在黎巴嫩和台湾海峡所从事的那样的军事行动。
