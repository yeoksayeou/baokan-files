Xinhua News Agency, Rio de Janeiro, February 24th: Gonçalves, chairman of the Brazilian Nationalist Parliamentary Front, recently issued a statement on Eisenhower's visit to Brazil, saying he hoped that "this visit will not result in negotiations or agreements that restrict our freedom internationally, or weaken our solidarity with underdeveloped countries, especially with Latin American countries."

The statement hopes that Eisenhower's visit will not strengthen trusts and financial groups, "because their purpose is to keep Brazil in a subordinate position, serving as a market for consumer goods and a source of raw materials."

Paulo Totty, president of the Brazilian Student Union, and Nonato, president of the Brazilian Middle School Student Union, announced on the 23rd the contents of a public letter from Brazilian students to Eisenhower. The letter stated: "Now, diplomacy can no longer take the form of military and economic intervention. Public opinion can no longer allow the dark history of the aggression against Guatemala to be replayed in Latin American life." The letter emphasized that "interference in our administration like the 'Point Four Program,' demands on our economy like those from the International Monetary Fund, and threats like those faced by courageous Cuba, are incompatible with the honor and dignity of Latin America."

The letter condemned the U.S. foreign policy as "embodying the will of international monopoly capital groups and trusts." It said that this policy would rather support governments like Trujillo in the Dominican Republic and Stroessner in Paraguay than Castro in Cuba.

Brazilian students warned Eisenhower: "Any intervention in Cuba will be regarded as an aggression against the entire Latin America." It said, "The basic principles of the Cuban revolution are the basic principles followed by the people of all countries living in Latin America."

Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, February 23rd: The Argentine Socialist Party and some other influential social organizations issued statements on Eisenhower's trip to South America, condemning U.S. policy toward Latin America.

Munis, secretary of the Executive Bureau of the Argentine Socialist Party, issued a statement saying: "The Argentine people do not sympathize with Eisenhower's visit because his government has resumed the 'big stick policy,' supports Franco's tyranny, maintains the colonial shackles of Panama and Puerto Rico, plans to take new 'Guatemalan actions' against Cuba, supports dictatorial governments, and opposes those who hope to implement liberation policies."

The latest issue of "Acción Semanal" said, "If Eisenhower wants to regain the friendship of Latin America, it is necessary for the United States to stop putting pressure and slandering the Castro regime, stop supporting the actions of Batista's followers, and stop supporting the sugar trusts."

The Argentine Committee for Solidarity with the Cuban Revolution issued a statement condemning Eisenhower's visit as an attempt to establish a "cordon sanitaire" to resist Cuba. The statement called on the Argentine people to strengthen their actions in solidarity with the Cuban Revolution and to reject "any agreement that our government may reach with Eisenhower against Cuba." The statement said that the Argentine people "do not view this visit with pleasure because the visit may involve interference in the sovereignty of some countries, attempting to exert pressure to stop any effort by one of these countries to liberate its people."

The Argentine Peace Committee issued a statement to Eisenhower saying: The Argentine people believe that their sovereignty has been harmed by the interference of large companies, mainly U.S. companies, in Argentina's internal affairs. "The simultaneous pressure exerted by U.S. officials to force us to grant economic and military privileges, including the right to establish bases, is contrary to the goodwill you have expressed and does nothing to promote genuine understanding between the two countries."

The statement said: The same situation exists throughout Latin America: Latin American countries all hope to establish relations with all countries in the world on the basis of equality and mutual respect. "That is why we feel uncomfortable when the following situation occurs: a Latin American country is subjected to enormous pressure or its internal affairs are interfered with, just like Cuba is actually encountering, simply because it wants to use independent and autonomous methods to achieve progress and prosperity."

Xinhua News Agency, February 24th: Buenos Aires dispatch: On the 23rd, a large number of slogans against Eisenhower's visit to Argentina appeared on the streets of the Argentine capital.

These slogans were written along the route to Buenos Aires International Airport. The slogans read: "Go home, Eisenhower" and "Yankees, go home."

Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, February 23rd: The Chilean newspaper "Siglo" today published an article supporting the demonstrations by Puerto Rican patriots demanding independence upon Eisenhower's arrival. The newspaper pointed out that this is a symbol of the condemnation of this "noble guest" by the people of Latin American countries.

The newspaper said: The U.S. president's visit is a serious threat to the people of Latin American countries who are resolutely striving for liberation. The U.S. government's hostile attitude towards all democratic movements of resurgence and its continued support for the universally hated dictatorial regimes have met with opposition from the broad masses of Latin America, as demonstrated by the heroic people of Puerto Rico.

    南美各国舆论警告艾森豪威尔
    不许美国在古巴重演危地马拉事件
    据新华社24日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西民族主义议会阵线主席贡卡尔维斯最近就艾森豪威尔访问巴西发表声明说，希望“这次访问不要造成这样的结果：谈判或者达成限制我们在国际上的自由的协定，或削弱我们同不发达国家的团结，特别是同拉丁美洲国家的团结的协定”。
    声明希望不要因艾森豪威尔的访问而加强托辣斯和金融集团，“因为它们的目的是要使巴西继续处于从属地位、充当消费品的市场和原料的来源。”
    巴西学生联合会主席保罗·托提和巴西中学生联合会主席诺纳托23日宣布了巴西学生们致艾森豪威尔的公开信的内容。信中说：“现在，外交已经不能再采取军事和经济干涉的形势了。公众舆论已经不能允许在拉丁美洲的生活中重演对危地马拉侵略的黑暗历史”。这封信强调说：“像‘第四点计划’那样的对我们行政的干涉，像国际货币基金组织那样对我国经济提出的要求，像勇敢的古巴所面临的那种威胁，是同拉丁美洲的荣誉和尊严不相容的”。
    这封信谴责美国的外交政策“体现了国际垄断资本集团和托辣斯的意愿”。它说，这种政策宁愿支持多米尼加的特鲁希略和巴拉圭的斯特罗斯纳之流的政府，而不支持古巴的卡斯特罗。
    巴西学生们警告艾森豪威尔：“对古巴的任何干涉，将被认为是对整个拉丁美洲的侵略。”它说：“古巴革命的基本原则，就是生活在拉丁美洲的各国人民所遵循的基本原则。”
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯23日电　阿根廷社会党和另外一些有影响的社会组织，就艾森豪威尔的南美之行发表声明，谴责美国对拉丁美洲的政策。
    阿根廷社会党执行局书记穆尼斯发表声明说：“阿根廷人民对艾森豪威尔的访问是不表同情的，因为他的政府重新执行‘大棒政策’、支持佛朗哥的暴政，维持巴拿马和波多黎各的殖民枷锁，筹划对古巴采取新‘危地马拉行动’，支持独裁政府，并且反对那些希望执行解放政策的人。”
    最新一期的“行动周刊”说，“艾森豪威尔要想重新得到拉丁美洲的友谊的话，美国就有必要不再对卡斯特罗政权施加压力和诬蔑中伤，不再支持巴蒂斯塔党徒的行动，不再支持糖业托辣斯。”
    阿根廷声援古巴革命委员会发表声明，谴责艾森豪威尔这次访问是要建立一条抵制古巴的“防疫线”。声明呼吁阿根廷人民加强他们声援古巴革命的行动，拒绝“我国政府可能同艾森豪威尔达成的任何反对古巴的协议”。声明说，阿根廷人民“不是怀着愉快的心情看待这种访问的，因为访问可能牵涉到对一些国家主权的干涉，试图施加压力，来制止这些国家中的一国为自己人民的解放作出任何努力”。
    阿根廷和平委员会发表致艾森豪威尔的声明说：阿根廷人民认为，他们的主权由于大公司、主要是美国大公司对阿根廷内政的干涉而受到了损害。“美国官员同时施加压力，硬要我们给予经济上和军事上的特权，其中包括建立基地的权利，这种做法是同阁下所表示的善意相违背的，而且根本无助于两国之间的真诚谅解。”
    声明说：整个拉丁美洲都发生同样的情况：拉丁美洲各国都希望在平等和互相尊重的基础上同世界各国建立关系。“这就是为什么我们在发生下面的情况时感到难受的原因：一个拉丁美洲国家只因为要用独立自主的办法来使自己得到进步和昌盛，就遭受到无比压力，或它的内政遭到干涉，就像古巴实际上遭遇到的一样。”
    新华社24日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：23日在阿根廷首都的街头上出现了大批反对艾森豪威尔到阿根廷访问的标语。
    这些标语写在通往布宜诺斯艾利斯国际机场沿途一带。标语写着：“滚回去，艾森豪威尔”和“美国佬，滚回去”。
    新华社圣地亚哥23日电　智利“世纪报”今天载文支持波多黎各爱国者在艾森豪威尔到达时举行的要求独立的示威游行。报纸指出，这是拉丁美洲各国人民谴责这位“高贵客人”的标志。
    报纸说：美国总统的访问是对正在坚决争取解放的拉丁美洲各国人民的严重威胁。美国政府敌视一切民主复兴运动的态度和它继续对众所痛恨的独裁政权的支持，使它遭到了拉丁美洲广大群众的反对，英勇的波多黎各人民就表明了这一点。
