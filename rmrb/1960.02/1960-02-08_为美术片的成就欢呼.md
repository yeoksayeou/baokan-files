I want to sing a song of praise for the achievements of animated films.

Having seen several excellent animated films, we are all very excited. If we compare the present with the past, the difference is truly like heaven and earth. China has had animated films for more than thirty years. However, work was very difficult at that time. The Wan Laiming brothers and others managed to produce only twenty or so short films after much hardship, and they suffered greatly. By the time of liberation, they were on the verge of collapse. The development in the ten years since liberation has been astonishing. The animated film studio now has more than 300 people working, and it has made great achievements. In particular, since the Great Leap Forward, the output in two years is equivalent to the output in the past ten years, while the cost has been reduced by half, and the creation time has also been shortened a lot.

I believe that the greatest and most important achievements of our animated films, especially those since the Great Leap Forward, are in the following two aspects:

First, they have implemented the Party's literary and artistic policy and educated our new generation with socialist and communist ideas. The ideological content of our animated films is very rich, reflecting the life and struggles of the Chinese people. In particular, "Long Live the Great Leap Forward" and "Stories in Murals" directly reflect and praise the Great Leap Forward.

In the past, animated films rarely depicted modern themes or major contemporary themes. However, "Long Live the Great Leap Forward" is an enthusiastic and magnificent hymn. "Stories in Murals" depicts how our heroic people fight against nature and overcome floods and storms. Comrades who have seen these two films are very inspired. This has shattered our past superstition that modern themes are difficult to express. This is a great creation and a successful experience.

Second, they are rich and diverse. Our animated films have many types, and now there are animation, puppet, and paper-cut films. Paper-cut films can be said to be our own creation. At the same time, the themes are very diverse, including folk tales, stories, myths, traditional dramas, and contemporary themes. This is also a major feature. From here, we can also see that the future of artistic creation in animated films is infinitely broad. Our national artistic traditions are very rich. For example, puppet shows and shadow plays in various regions are all art forms that can be used in animated films. There are also many folk arts that can be used to make the types of films more diverse.

Our animated films have explored the national form and national style of animated films. The characteristics of nationalization and mass character are the key to testing the success or failure of our literary and artistic creations. We have grasped the characteristics of our nation's life and struggle, as well as the national and folk art forms of how to express these lives and struggles, and thus created a national style. This is an important achievement. Just like the achievements of our film industry and the entire literature and art in the past ten years, we have our national form and created a national style.

From some of the excellent animated films we have seen, the lives, thoughts, feelings, and forms of struggle of the Chinese people are expressed in a Chinese way. In terms of art and music, they are also basically in national forms. Films such as "A Zhuang Brocade," "The Little Fish," "A Shoe," "Long Live the Great Leap Forward," and "Stories in Murals" are all like this. The pictures and music, the facial features and costumes of the characters in "A Zhuang Brocade" all express the characteristics of the Zhuang nationality. "The Little Fish," a paper-cut film, expresses the Chinese people's spirit of resisting imperialist aggression and the bravery and wisdom of the working people. The image of the little fish is completely Chinese, very beautiful, and very cute. Animated film workers have drawn rich nourishment from the people's life and struggle, and have explored various aspects of character creation and music, forming a national style in many ways. With nationalization, it will surely be loved by the masses and will also be mass character. This is a successful experience worth writing about in detail.

Here, I would like to make two more hopes:

First, is the issue of further mass character. How to further nationalize and make it more popular, both in terms of script content and expression forms, so that the film's thoughts, feelings, art, and music can more fully express the characteristics of our era and the characteristics of socialist literature and art, is still a goal worth continuing to strive for.

Second, we need to produce more and bolder contemporary themes to reflect our Great Leap Forward, reflect the great achievements and new life of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Party, and reflect the situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind.

The main audience for animated films is children. They need to receive socialist-communist education, improve their ideological understanding, cultivate their noble moral character, and enrich their knowledge. Animated films are one of the best forms to educate them. We cheer for the achievements of animated films, and we hope to produce more and better spiritual food for our next generation. Animated films have infinitely broad prospects, truly an unlimited future. Let us hold high the great banner of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, pool our wisdom and efforts, and climb to the peak of socialist art!

### 为美术片的成就欢呼

    为美术片的成就欢呼
    阳翰笙
    我要为美术片的成就唱一支赞歌。
    看了几部优秀的美术片，我们都很兴奋，如果拿现在和从前比一下，真有天壤之别。中国有美术片已经有三十多年了。但是那时工作是很困难的，万籁鸣等三兄弟惨淡经营也才搞了二十几部短片，还吃尽了苦头。到解放前就已濒于绝境。解放后十年来的发展是很惊人的。现在的美术片厂已有三百多人在工作，做出了很大成绩，特别是大跃进以来，二年的产量相当于过去十年的产量，成本却降低了一半，创作时间也缩短了很多。
    我认为：我们的美术片，特别是大跃进以来的美术片，最大的、最主要的成就，是这样两方面：
    一是执行了党的文艺方针，用社会主义、共产主义思想教育我们的新一代。在我们的美术片里，思想内容很丰富。表现了我国人民的生活和斗争。特别是“大跃进万岁”和“壁画里的故事”，直接反映和歌颂了大跃进。
    美术片表现现代题材，表现时代的重大题材，过去还不多。而“大跃进万岁”这部美术片就是一支热情洋溢、气势磅礴的赞歌。“壁画里的故事”写我们英雄的人民怎样向自然作斗争，战胜了水灾和风暴。看了这两部影片的同志，都很振奋。这就打破了我们过去认为现代题材不好表现的迷信。这是一个很大的创造，也是成功的经验。
    二是丰富多采。我们的美术片片种多，现在已经有动画、木偶、剪纸三种。剪纸片可以说是我们的一个创造。同时题材很多样，有民间传说、故事、神话、传统剧目、还有当代题材。这也是一大特色。从这里，也可以看到美术片艺术创造的前途是无限广阔的。我们的民族艺术传统很丰富，比如各个地区的木偶剧和皮影戏，就都是美术片可以运用的艺术形式。民间艺术也还有很多可以运用，使得片种更加多样化。
    我们的美术片，已经探索到了美术片的民族形式和民族风格。民族化和群众化的特色，是测验我们文学艺术创作成败关键之所系。我们抓住了我们民族的生活和斗争的特色，以及如何表现这些生活和斗争的民族民间的艺术形式，因而就创造了民族的风格。这是一个重要的成就。正如十年来我们的电影事业和整个文学艺术所取得的成就一样，有了我们的民族形式，创造了民族风格。
    从我们已经看到的一些优秀的美术片来看，表现的中国人民的生活、思想、感情和斗争形式都是中国式的。从美术、音乐等方面来说，也基本上是民族形式的。如“一幅僮锦”、“渔童”、“一只鞋”、“大跃进万岁”、“壁画里的故事”等片，都是如此。“一幅僮锦”的画面和音乐、人物的脸型和服饰，都表现了僮族的特点。“渔童”这部剪纸片，表现了中国人民反抗帝国主义侵略的斗争精神，表现了劳动人民的勇敢和智慧；渔童的形象，完全是中国式的，很美，很可爱。美术片工作者从人民的生活斗争中汲取丰富的养料，在人物的塑造和音乐等等方面，作了探索，多方面地形成了民族风格。有了民族化，那必定为群众所喜闻乐见，也就有了群众化。这是值得大书特书的成功经验。
    在这里，我想再提两点希望：
    第一，是进一步群众化的问题。无论在剧本内容和表现形式等方面，如何进一步民族化、群众化，使影片的思想感情、美术、音乐各方面更加能充分地表现我们这时代的特点，更加表现社会主义文学艺术的特点，还是一个值得继续努力的目标。
    第二，需要更多、更大胆地摄制当代题材的东西，来反映我们的大跃进，反映我国人民在党的领导下的丰功伟绩和新的生活，反映东风压倒西风的形势。
    美术片主要对象是少年儿童。他们需要受到社会主义—共产主义的教育，提高他们的思想认识，培养他们有高尚的道德品质，丰富他们的知识，美术片是对他们进行教育的最好的形式之一。我们为美术片的成就欢呼，也就希望为我们的下一代生产更多更好的精神粮食。美术片有无限广阔的天地，真是前途无限。让我们高举着毛泽东文艺思想的大旗，群策群力，攀登上社会主义艺术的高峰！
