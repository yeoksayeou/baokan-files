    Shanghai, February 17th (by our newspaper) - From the very beginning of this year, the workers of the Shanghai Liming Printing and Dyeing Factory have been paying attention to conserving coal, striving to produce more products with less fuel. The Party organization of this factory started by grasping ideology and, on this basis, mobilized the masses to actively carry out the work of saving coal. In January, the coal consumption per unit of product decreased by about 25% compared with the average of last year.

    The Liming Printing and Dyeing Factory needs a large amount of steam when printing and dyeing various colored cloths. Although the factory is not large in scale, it used to consume more than 9,000 tons of coal a year at its peak. Last year, the factory kept a close grip on the work of saving coal, and as a result, while production increased by 22% compared with 1958, coal consumption decreased by more than one-third, making it one of the advanced units in Shanghai in saving coal. At the beginning of this year, after analyzing the needs of production development and coal supply this year, the Party branch of the factory determined to continue to grasp the important link of saving coal to ensure the continued leap forward this year.

    In the activity of saving coal, on the one hand, all the workers of the factory strived to win the support of the leaders at higher levels and fraternal factories, and on the other hand, they sent people out to strengthen contacts with many factories in other industries to collect all kinds of waste fuel that people did not want. They heard that the Zhongjian Boiler Factory used large pieces of coke when casting sand molds, leaving a large amount of coke dust, which was of no use. They thought that this coke dust might be suitable for the printing and dyeing factory, so they immediately sent people to contact them, and as a result, they got more than 30 tons at once. They tried it out and found that it was indeed a very good fuel. In the ash of the power plant, some coal components had not been completely burned, and the power plant used to transport it by ship as "waste" to the outer Wusongkou to dump it into the sea. After learning about this, the Liming Factory immediately conducted experiments and found that it could also be used. Some coal dust that the foundry factories had been unable to use for a long time and that was difficult to dispose of was taken by the Liming Factory and played a great role, making the best use of everything. In January, the factory adopted this method and successively found more than 280 tons of usable coal in 15 steel mills, shipyards, and chemical plants. The entire factory has more than 400 people, and a total of more than 1,100 person-times participated in this work. Party branch secretaries, factory directors, and other leading cadres also personally participated, and went to other factories with the masses to screen and transport coal.

    The amount of coal is constantly increasing, but the quality of coal is poor. In response to this problem, the Party branch of the Liming Factory mobilized the masses to carry out technological innovation, trying every means to make these low-quality coals emit more heat. At the beginning, when using power plant ash, only 15% could be mixed in the total coal consumption. The coal saving research group composed of factory directors, technicians, and workers, after many experiments, finally found the law of this fuel and improved the technology of burning boilers, and now it has gradually increased to 40%. The scope of technological innovation has also expanded. Not only the boiler workers have improved their technology, but also the printing and dyeing workers have been carrying out technological innovations on a large scale, and recently adopted a series of new technologies that can save fuel. For example, in January this year, the method of acid-alkali and acid-enzyme chemical desizing was adopted, which completely eliminated the boiling process, which not only saved a lot of coal, but also saved a lot of electricity.

    The Liming Printing and Dyeing Factory has achieved great success in saving coal. The average coal consumption per thousand meters of colored cloth was 137.48 kilograms last year, and it decreased to 108.79 kilograms in January this year, which is about 3 kilograms lower than the lowest fourth quarter of last year. In January, a lot of coal was found, and a lot of coal was saved. At the end of the month, the coal remaining in the warehouse was more than the coal used in January.

    丽明印染厂大力节约煤炭保证生产跃进
    本报上海17日电　上海丽明印染厂职工在今年一开始就注意节约用煤，力争少用燃料多出产品。这个厂的党组织从抓思想入手，并在这个基础上发动群众积极开展节约煤炭的工作，1月份单位产品的耗煤量比去年平均降低25％左右。
    丽明印染厂在印染各种色布时，需要大量的蒸汽，工厂规模虽然不大，而过去用煤最多时一年要消耗九千多吨。去年，这个厂对节约用煤的工作一直抓得很紧，结果在生产比1958年增长22％的同时，用煤量反而降低三分之一以上，成为上海市节约用煤先进单位之一。今年年初，这个厂的党支部分析了今年生产发展的需要和煤炭供应情况后，确定继续抓紧节约用煤这一重要环节，来保证实现今年的继续跃进。
    在节约煤炭的活动中，全厂职工一方面努力争取上级领导和兄弟工厂的支持，一方面派人出去和别的行业的许多工厂加强联系，搜集各种人家不要的下脚燃料。他们听到中建锅炉厂在翻砂铸件时，用的都是大块焦炭，剩下大量的焦炭屑，没有用处。他们一想这种焦炭屑对印染厂可能合用，于是马上派人前往联系，结果一次就拿到了三十多吨，回来一试，果然是一种很好的燃料。发电厂的炉灰里有些煤的成分还没有完全燃透，而发电厂过去一直把它当“废物”用船运到吴淞口外倒在海里。丽明厂知道这件事情之后，也马上进行试验，同样可以利用。有些翻砂厂长期以来无法利用、而又很难处理的煤炭屑，被丽明厂拿去以后，也都发挥了很大的作用，做到了物尽其用。1月份，这个厂采取这种办法，先后在十五个钢铁厂、造船厂、化工厂找到了二百八十多吨可用的煤炭。整个工厂四百多人，而前后参加这项工作的共有一千一百多人次。党支部书记、厂长等领导干部也亲自参加，和群众一起到别的工厂去筛煤、运煤。
    煤炭的数量不断增加，但是煤的质量较差。丽明厂的党支部针对这个问题，又发动群众开展了技术革新，千方百计地叫这些低质煤发出更大的热量。开始用发电厂的炉灰时，在全部用煤中还只能搭用15％。厂长、技术人员、工人们组成的节约用煤研究小组，经过了多次的试验，终于找出了这种燃料的规律，改进了烧锅炉的技术，现在已经逐步提高到40％。技术革新的范围，也扩大了。不仅司炉工人改进技术，连印染工人也大搞工艺革新，最近采取了一系列可以节约燃料的新技术。例如今年1月份，采用酸碱和酸酶化学退浆的办法，根本取消了煮炼这道工序，不但节约了大量的煤炭，而且省了很多电力。
    丽明印染厂节约用煤取得很大成绩。去年全年平均每一千米色布用煤一百三十七点四八公斤，今年1月份降低到一百零八点七九公斤，比去年最低的第四季度还降低了三公斤左右。1月份，找到了很多煤，省用了很多煤，在月底，仓库里剩余下来的煤，比1月份用掉的煤还多。
