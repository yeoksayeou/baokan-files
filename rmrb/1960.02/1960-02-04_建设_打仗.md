Party Committee Secretary's Notes

    Construction and Fighting
    Chen Jianzhang, Secretary of the Jiangdong Machinery Factory Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Nanchang, Jiangxi Province

    Like the surging national situation, the workers of our machinery factory, whose backbone is composed of returned volunteer soldiers, have also put forward magnificent combat tasks this year: "The annual production of machine tools should increase tenfold compared with 1959, and the total output value should increase sevenfold." Only a little over ten days have passed in 1960, and our factory workers have created a new situation of "a red start, red every day, and red across the board." The record of two new precision lathe beds produced daily was achieved to "remain red to the end" in 1959, and now it has been increased to three per day. In this excellent national situation of great leap forward, our returned volunteer soldiers are joyfully praising: The 1960s are truly a magnificent era, and production and construction are like fighting a war. The Party led us to win the world-shaking victories of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, and the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and it will surely lead us to win the victory of socialist construction in the 1960s. We want to cheer for the arrival of victory, and we will never be satisfied with a red start, we want to be red every day, red every month, red across the board, and red to the end.

    Although our factory only manufactured general and sporadic machinery such as water pumps and belt lathes last year, the most sophisticated product was the C620 screw lathe successfully trial-produced. This year, with the heroic spirit of realizing the leap forward plan by "treating production as fighting a war," we decided to shift machine tool production from sporadic to batch production, and from low-level to high-level. In addition to batch manufacturing C620, we will also trial-produce large lathes and precision universal milling machines, gear hobbing machines, indexing heads and other high-end products. Compared with the current production capacity, our factory's technical equipment is still in the "era of millet plus rifles." In terms of equipment, we lack large and precise machines. In terms of technical strength, all workshops in the factory have more apprentices and fewer technicians. Most comrades can only repair parts and are unfamiliar with new products. In particular, after verification, the factory as a whole is still short of more than 840,000 man-hours, accounting for more than 72.5% of the actual required man-hours. In addition, the command ability of commanders at all levels is far from meeting the needs of combat. All these are objective difficulties that cannot be ignored in the leap forward.

    However, we were fighting troops in the past, and we are still fighting troops now. The main combat targets in the past were Chiang Kai-shek and US imperialism, and now the main combat targets are "nature" and "production." We believe that everything depends on human effort. By doing things with the same brave, firm, and loyal revolutionary spirit as on the front line, any difficulties can be overcome. Moreover, in this excellent situation of the motherland's construction advancing rapidly, compared with the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, and the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the difficulties before us are insignificant.

    In past wars, if we lacked equipment, we seized weapons from the enemy. We once sang heroically: "If we have no food, no clothing, the enemy will send it to us; if we have no guns, no cannons, the enemy will make them for us!" Now that we have no equipment, we also swear to extract it from "nature" with this heroic revolutionary spirit, and seize it from production. We will vigorously engage in technical revolution, train the troops while fighting, rapidly improve the combat literacy of workers, and use a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to manufacture urgently needed equipment ourselves, and arm ourselves. The mood of waiting, watching, and simply reaching out upward in the leap forward battle is forever incompatible with the revolutionary character of our revolutionary fighters.

    "Construction is like fighting a war," this sentence is filled with the precious fighting spirit of our soldiers. As long as we consolidate and develop this spirit, we will surely be able to remove the various obstacles in front of us, take the bunkers, and in this surging 1960s, forever "be red every day, red every month, red across the board, and red to the end."

    建设·打仗
    中共江西南昌江东机械厂委员会书记　　陈建章
    我们这个以归国志愿军战士为骨干组成的机械厂的工人们也和全国汹涌澎湃的形势一样，今年也提出了宏伟的战斗任务：“全年机床生产要比1959年增加十倍，总产值要增加七番。”1960年才过去十多天，我厂工人们又创造了一个“开门红，日日红，满堂红”的新局面。新制精密车床床身日产两台的纪录是为了1959年“红到底”才跃上去的，现在又提高到日产三台了。处在这个全国大好跃进形势中，我们的归国志愿军战士，都兴高采烈的歌颂着：六十年代，真是轰轰烈烈的时代，生产建设就和打仗一样。党领导我们夺得震憾世界的抗日战争、解放战争、抗美援朝战争的胜利，也一定会领导我们夺得六十年代社会主义大建设的胜利。我们要欢呼胜利的到来，我们决不满足开门红，我们要日日红、月月红、满堂红、红到底。
    我厂去年虽然只制造了水泵、皮带车床等一般的零星机械，最精密的要算试制成功的C620螺丝车床。今年，我们有了这种把“生产作为打仗”来实现跃进计划的英雄气概，我们决定要把机床生产由零星转入成批，由低级转入高级，除成批制造C620之外，还要试制大型车床和精密的万能铣床、滚齿机、分度头等高级产品。计划任务与当前的生产能力比较起来，我们这个工厂的技术装备还是处在“小米加步枪的时代”。在设备上，我们缺少大型、精密的机器。在技术力量上，全厂各车间都是学徒多技工少，大多数同志只会修理零件，对新产品不懂不熟。特别是经过核实，全厂劳力尚差工时八十四万多个，占实需工时的72．5％之多，另外，各级指挥员的指挥能力，也远远不能适应战斗的需要。所有这些都是跃进中不能忽视的客观困难。
    但是，我们以前是战斗部队，现在仍然是战斗部队，以前主要的战斗目标是蒋介石、美帝国主义，现在主要的战斗目标是“自然界”是“生产”。我们相信，事在人为，用前线作战一样的勇敢、坚定、忠诚的革命精神办事，任何困难都是可以克服的。况且，在这祖国建设一日千里的大好形势下，与抗日战争、解放战争、抗美援朝战争比较起来，摆在我们面前的困难是微不足道的。
    我们在过去的战争中，缺少装备，就夺取敌人的武器。我们曾豪迈地唱过：“没有吃，没有穿，自有那敌人送上前；没有枪，没有炮，敌人给我们造！”现在我们没有设备，我们也誓以这种豪迈的革命精神，向“自然界”索取，从生产中夺来。我们要大闹技术革命，边战斗边训练队伍，高速度提高工人的战斗素养，并以土洋结合的办法，自制急需的各种设备，自己武装自己。那种在跃进的战斗中等待、观望、光向上伸手的情绪同我们这些革命战士的革命性格是永远无缘的。
    “建设就如打仗”，这句话里洋溢着我们战士们可贵的战斗精神。只要我们巩固和发挥这种精神，就一定能扫除摆在我们面前的种种障碍，攻下碉堡，在这跃进浪头汹涌澎湃的六十年代里，永远“日日红、月月红、满堂红、红到底。”
