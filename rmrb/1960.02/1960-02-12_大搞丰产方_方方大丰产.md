Go All Out for High-Yield Squares, Every Square a Great Harvest

Zhang Kerang
Vice Governor of Hebei Province

High-yield squares are a new product of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. The emergence of this new farming system for rapidly developing agricultural production is rapidly developing under the guidance of the thought of continuous revolution. In 1958, under the radiant light of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, the path of the Great Leap Forward was opened up. The broad masses, full of vigor and high spirits, went all out to cultivate garden-style fields, creating favorable conditions for comprehensively applying the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture and achieving high-yields over large areas. At the same time, the broad rural cadres responded to the call to cultivate experimental plots, participate in production, and lead production. Under such favorable circumstances, high-yield squares combining cadre experimental plots and mass high-yield fields emerged. Party organizations at all levels in Hebei Province fully valued this new thing, promptly summarized the experience of carrying out the high-yield square movement, and promoted it universally throughout the province. In 1959, with the development and growth of the People's Communes, the area of high-yield squares rapidly increased from more than 2 million mu in 1958 to 35 million mu. Whether in the plains or mountains, whether for food crops or cash crops, there were squares everywhere, squares for everything. The red flags of high-yield squares were planted all over the province.

Communalization Promotes the Great Development of High-Yield Squares

The People's Communes have opened up infinitely broad prospects for the development of high-yield squares. When construction of high-yield squares began in 1958, many contradictions, large and small, were encountered, and the main aspect of the contradiction was that the original small-scale, single-operation agricultural cooperatives could not adapt to the requirements of high-speed production development. Cultivating high-yield squares required contiguous land, but land with the same soil quality and suitable terrain was scattered among several agricultural cooperatives; high-yield squares needed to drill wells, buy machines, and engage in large-scale farmland capital construction, but agricultural cooperatives had few people and weak strength, and could not organize large amounts of funds and labor in a short time. All this demanded a new, larger-scale production organization with a wider scope of operation to solve the problems that agricultural cooperatives were unable to solve. Therefore, the emergence of the People's Communes was like timely rain, nourishing the young sprout of the high-yield square and enabling it to grow vigorously. For example, the Cixian-Cheng'an People's Commune, when it began demarcating squares for operation in the first half of 1958, united the forces of four original agricultural cooperatives and fought for a spring season, only to cultivate 3,000 mu. After the establishment of the People's Commune, it unified the organization of forces from all aspects of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and the military. In three months, it dug 154 channels, drilled 76 wells, built more than a thousand brick wells, and expanded irrigation by more than 80,000 mu. At the same time, through unified planning, it enabled the land of each team to be contiguous, realizing the regional planting of various crops such as grain, cotton, and oil.

The People's Communes not only promoted the production and construction of high-yield squares, but also further strengthened the organization of agricultural production and improved the level of operation and management. Each People's Commune organized management committees and leading groups in the high-yield squares, established specialized teams, and clarified the responsibility system. In particular, due to the in-depth development of the high-yield square movement, it has begun to break through the small-scale operation based on production teams, and various forms of operation and management such as joint operation by teams, joint operation by communes and teams, and commune operation have emerged, gradually developing towards large-scale collective operation. With large collective operation, there are many people and great strength, it is easy to raise funds, and it is convenient to carry out diversified operations, which provides better conditions for unified planning of rural construction and planned transformation of nature. The development of this large-scale collective operation is of great significance for promoting the continuous Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, for increasing the proportion of the collective economy of the communes, and thus for promoting the gradual transition of the People's Communes from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people.

The growth of high-yield squares was not smooth sailing. When high-yield squares were first established, some people said that engaging in squares was a formality, "Increased production can be achieved with water and fertilizer, what difference does it make whether there is a square or not"; a few people were afraid that engaging in squares would be troublesome, that there would be too many people with different ideas, that engaging in squares would not increase production, and that it would be a waste of effort, etc. In short, they were full of worries. In response to this situation, Party organizations in various places first focused on solving ideological problems. After mobilizing the masses and launching a debate on the topic of "How to ensure the high-speed development of agricultural production, what are the advantages of high-yield squares, should high-yield squares be established, and how to establish them," the ideological awareness of the broad masses was raised. Everyone recognized that high-yield squares are a revolution to transform the farming system of the small-scale peasant economy and build socialist large-scale production. Only by engaging in high-yield squares can we adapt to the development of mechanization and electrification, more comprehensively implement the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, and further increase yields. On this basis, a series of policy issues such as operating forms, investment and distribution, and labor organization were also addressed, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the broad masses and set off a high tide of engaging in high-yield squares. Starting from the sowing of autumn wheat in 1958, with the construction of water conservancy projects, deep plowing and deep turning, soil improvement, leveling land, and large-scale garden-style cultivation, more than 10 million mu of wheat high-yield squares were established throughout the province, all of which were leveled, the ridges were straight, irrigation and drainage were free, regional planting, planting specifications, and management were meticulous. This initial achievement further encouraged the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses, so in the winter of 1958 and the spring of 1959, braving the severe cold and breaking the frozen soil, 20 million mu of high-yield squares were built in one fell swoop. These high-yield squares played a significant role in increasing production in the continuous Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. The area of high-yield squares in the province accounted for about 25% of the total sown area, while the output of high-yield squares could reach 40% of the total output. All high-yield squares had yields that were 30%, 50%, or even 100% to 200% higher than the local general field yields.

A Great Revolution in the Farming System

High-yield squares are socialist large-scale production and large-scale construction, and their emergence has great significance. High-yield squares are not only about linking small plots of land into large plots, nor are they simply an advanced farming method, but a great revolution in the farming system. After cooperativization in rural China, the production relations of the small-scale peasant economy no longer existed, but the scattered plots, crisscrossing roads, uneven terrain, and the interspersing of paddy fields and dry land, the farming system and farming habits of scattered operation still had deep roots, hindering the development of large-scale production and large-scale construction. With the high-yield square, this form of operation for socialist large-scale production, the outlook is completely new. The high-yield square connects large areas of land, so it can follow unified planning to drill wells and open channels, making the layout of farmland water conservancy construction more reasonable. It can level the land according to the terrain, and implement regional planting and fertilization according to different soil types, thereby more effectively exploiting the potential of the land. Planting the same crop on a considerable area, with consistent cultivation and management seasons, makes it easier to use mechanical cultivation and irrigation. At the same time, it facilitates planned planting, rational organization of labor, specialized management, and organization of competitions and production inspections. This completely changes the farming system of the small-scale peasant economy and paves the way for the development of socialist large-scale production.

High-yield squares have promoted farmland capital construction, comprehensively applied the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, and thus achieved a Great Leap Forward and a Great Increase in Production. Demarcating high-yield squares requires leveling hills and filling ditches within the square, and rationally building ditches and wells according to the terrain. Various methods must also be adopted to improve the poor soil within the square, thereby promoting the development of farmland capital construction. Many places where paddy fields and dry land were interspersed have all become irrigated land after the square construction, turning low-yield fields into high-yield fields, and making high-yield fields even higher, achieving comprehensive high-yields. In the past, under the circumstances of scattered and fragmented land, although requirements such as tillage depth, seedling density, fertilization amount, and irrigation standards were put forward in cultivation management, it was difficult to implement them all according to technical requirements. The high-yield square is different. The high-yield square has regular field shapes, standard ridges, and it is easy to plan and inspect how many seedlings to keep per mu, how much fertilizer to apply, and how much water to irrigate. In particular, the implementation of regional planting greatly facilitates mechanical operation. In 1959, many high-yield squares implemented mechanical cultivation and used airplanes to control pests, achieving labor saving, high efficiency, and drug and money saving. Due to the large-scale farmland capital construction and comprehensive application of the "Eight-Point Charter," high-yield squares have achieved tremendous harvests. In An'guo County, 800,000 mu of land, 80% of the land was developed into high-yield squares in 1959, and grain yield per mu jumped to 800 jin, an increase of 35.3% compared to 1958. The thousand-mu high-yield square of Wu'renqiao Commune in this county was uneven and full of ditches in the past. After a hard battle in the autumn, they cut down "Wolonggang" and filled in "Toad Pond," and all of them were built into high-yield squares. In 1959, they harvested a season of wheat and a season of corn, with an annual yield of more than 1,800 jin per mu. Nearly half of the 45,000 mu of cotton squares in Cheng'an People's Commune implemented mechanical cultivation. Because they paid attention to fine cultivation management while using machines, they achieved a high-yield of 180 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 80% compared to 1958. With the rapid increase in production, the commodity volume of crops has also greatly increased, so high-yield squares have become commodity production bases. This form of operation of high-yield squares is also being widely adopted in diversified operations such as forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. Large areas of high-yield forests, high-yield fruit tree ditches, high-yield livestock groups, high-yield fish ponds, and high-yield fishing boats have appeared everywhere in the province. High-yield squares are promoting the progress of the all-round revolution in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.

High-yield squares have not only promoted the development of agricultural production, but have also greatly advanced agricultural science and technology. In order to find the laws of higher yields, people have vigorously developed experimental plots, high-yield fields, and seed fields in high-yield squares. The experimental plot is the command field of the high-yield square. Various yield-increasing measures are taken first in the experimental plot to gain experience before being promoted on a large scale, which greatly promotes the realization of large-area high-yield plans. In order to adapt to the development of agricultural science and technology, experimental stations and research groups have also been organized with high-yield squares as units, vigorously promoting the style of the masses running science. In 1959, the masses in the province carried out more than 9,000 experimental projects, of which more than 760 have achieved great success. In order to closely integrate theory and practice, red and expert schools in high-yield squares have also been established. The management specialized teams of high-yield squares are both production personnel and research personnel, and those who are capable are teachers, teaching and learning from each other, effectively improving the scientific and technological level of the broad masses of farmers, and a red and expert agricultural science and technology team is growing rapidly. To learn technology, one must have culture. With technology entering the square, culture also enters the square. Militia training and cultural entertainment have also entered the square with the demands of the commune members. In this way, the high-yield square has become an experimental field and a large classroom.

With the establishment of high-yield squares, the natural outlook has greatly changed. The vast square fields are boundless, the ditches and canals within the square are like nets, and the roads are connected in all directions. Many high-yield squares also plant fruit trees along the roads and canals, and raise fish and plant lotus roots in the ditches and ponds, which greatly beautifies the countryside on the one hand, and enriches the production content of diversified operations on the other. Many high-yield squares have established pig farms, fertilizer plants, agricultural tool repair stations, and meteorological observation groups in the square. Some have also established square field canteens and rest sheds, which further enriches the construction of high-yield squares and makes the production and life of commune members in the square more pleasant and convenient.

Engaging in high-yield squares not only changed the natural outlook and increased the yield of various crops, but also changed the mental outlook of the people. The transformation from decentralized small production to collective large production first greatly enhanced the collectivist thinking and organization and discipline of the broad masses of commune members. The construction, operation, and management of high-yield squares require large-scale cooperation and support, which further enhances people's communist ideology. Due to the large-scale construction, large-scale production, and large-scale harvest of high-yield squares, the old ideas and habitual forces that bind people have been broken through, so that people no longer "listen to fate." This leap in thinking from being subject to nature to understanding and transforming nature enables the broad masses to more actively exert their subjective initiative, thereby further developing the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and the revolutionary spirit of hard work, practical work, and skillful work, promoting agricultural production to advance at an increasingly high speed.

Push High-Yield Squares to a Higher Level

1960 is the first year of large-scale modernization of agricultural construction. In order to ensure a better and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in 1960, we must, in the spirit of "going all out, adapting to local conditions, doing our best, and the more the better," carry out a large-area high-yield movement centered on engaging in high-yield squares. Irrigated land should be used for squares, and dry land should be planted in squares as much as possible, so that there are squares everywhere in mountainous areas, plains, coasts, grasslands, irrigated land, dry land, distant land, and nearby land, and all kinds of crops and various production items have squares, striving to make the area of high-yield squares in the province reach more than half of the total sown area, and the output of high-yield squares strive to exceed the output of local field crops by 30%, 50%, or even 100% or more, so that high-yield squares become the main operating form of agricultural production in our province. Building high-yield squares is a process of continuous improvement, so standards should be continuously improved, so that high-yield squares gradually develop and improve from small to large and from low-level to high-level.

Since last winter, combined with the farmland capital construction movement centered on water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, high-yield squares have been vigorously developed throughout the province. At present, the province has completed field projects. There are more than 40 million mu of high-yield squares that have achieved garden-style cultivation. In farmland capital construction, it is emphasized to use the results of soil surveys and identifications, conduct unified planning according to terrain, soil quality, and water source distribution, level along contour lines, and supplement incomplete field projects, build field roads, and generally achieve water and canals, flat ground and straight ridges, free irrigation and drainage, and convenient transportation, to create good conditions for better applying the "Eight-Point Charter" and gradually realizing semi-mechanized and mechanized cultivation.

In order to push the movement of engaging in high-yield squares to a new stage, in 1960, combined with engaging in high-yield squares, we must build square field pig farms on a large scale, carry out tool reform on a large scale, and conduct pilot work on mechanization with high-yield squares as the base. In order to accelerate the realization of the grand goal of one pig per person and one pig per mu, and to combine animal husbandry production with large-scale agricultural cultivation, developing square field pig farms is one of the best forms. Square field pig farms can grow feed on the spot and use fertilizer on the spot, greatly reducing the huge transportation task. At the same time, square field pig farms with conditions can use the mechanical energy and power supply of field equipment to gradually implement semi-mechanization and mechanization of the production process, greatly saving labor; raising pigs in square fields effectively reduces the chance of disease transmission and ensures that pigs grow healthily; grazing can also be carried out before sowing and after harvesting. In short, raising pigs in square fields has many benefits. Since the beginning of last winter, the development of pig production in our province has been very rapid, and the construction of square field pig farms has also been increasing day by day. According to recent incomplete statistics, 100,000 square field pig farms have been built throughout the province.

High-yield squares must engage in large-scale farmland capital construction, implement a higher degree of intensive cultivation, and ensure stable high yields every year. The fundamental way out of this problem lies in realizing agricultural mechanization. It is an urgent task to immediately start pilot projects and prepare for large-scale development. In 1960, we will try to build mechanized high-yield squares in key areas for realizing mechanization, so that the degree of mechanization of operations such as cultivation, drainage, irrigation, and transportation will be greatly improved. Other areas should also regard high-yield squares as the focus of mechanical cultivation to systematically summarize the experience of mechanical matching, comprehensive utilization, operation and management, and the adaptation of mechanization to the agronomic requirements of intensive cultivation. At the same time, we must vigorously develop agricultural science and technology education, adopt diverse methods, and actively cultivate technical personnel for mechanization to welcome the large-scale development of mechanization.

On the one hand, pilot projects for mechanization are carried out, and on the other hand, tool reform is universally carried out. Vigorously carrying out tool reform is the prelude to realizing semi-mechanization and mechanization, and is the main way to solve the current problem that the growth of labor force cannot keep up with the high-speed development of production. Especially under the current situation where manual labor is the mainstay, reforming tools has more important practical significance. High-yield squares have formed a relatively complete scientific system in cultivation management, so tool reform should also be oriented to high-yield squares, and according to the requirements of high-yield squares, a comprehensive reform of tools in each process should be carried out systematically, striving to make all processes of all agricultural tasks use new-style agricultural tools and improved agricultural tools, to comprehensively improve labor efficiency.

To do a good job in high-yield squares, we must also adhere to the implementation of the General Line, adhere to the thought of continuous revolution and high-speed leap forward, boost revolutionary enthusiasm, and continue to criticize and overcome various right-leaning conservative ideas such as "increasing production to the top" and "limited potential" and the habitual forces of the farming system of the small-scale peasant economy, so that socialist large-scale production can be further developed and improved, and the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses can be further enhanced. We must further promote the working method of the mass line, vigorously carry out mass movements, especially to vigorously carry out inspections and evaluations, plant red flags, establish pacesetters, and carry out the hand-in-hand competition of comparing, learning, catching up, and helping. The purpose of engaging in high-yield squares is to achieve large-area high-yields, which requires concerted efforts and mutual cooperation; on the other hand, the goals in high-yield squares are unified, and the actions are consistent, which is more conducive to mutual learning and common improvement. We advocate "running the square diligently and thriftily," so that the long-term construction of the high-yield square is closely combined with the current increase in production, gradually improving, and at the same time, we must actively improve the operation and management of the high-yield square to receive higher economic results. The high-yield square is the banner of the general field. While strengthening the leadership of the high-yield square, we must also pay attention to timely summarizing the yield-increasing measures and operation and management experience in the high-yield square, and timely promote them to the general field, to give play to the role of the high-yield square in driving the comprehensive increase in production of the general field.

Moving Towards the Gardenization of the Land

High-yield squares are extremely valuable new things. Their value lies in: high-yield squares show the infinitely bright future of high-speed development of agricultural production. Their further development and improvement will enable us to move towards the great goal of gardenizing the land. The area of high-yield squares increases from small to large, the construction content gradually increases, and under the conditions of high mechanization and high intensive cultivation, the yield of crops will increase by multiples, and several times. The great development of agriculture will inevitably promote the greater development of forestry, animal husbandry, and other diversified production. The entire rural area will be one where there is no land that is not a square, the ditches and roads are like spider webs, machines are ringing everywhere, and the square fields have factories. The vast rural areas will become a paradise on earth with abundant grains, prosperous livestock, shady green trees, fruits hanging from branches, fish and shrimp filling ponds, and a riot of color.

    大搞丰产方　方方大丰产
    河北省副省长　张克让
    丰产方是总路线、大跃进和人民公社的新产物。这种高速度发展农业生产的新的耕作制度的出现，是在不断革命的思想指导下，迅速发展起来的。1958年，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，开创了大跃进的道路。广大群众意气风发，干劲十足，大搞耕作园田化的耕作方法，为综合运用农业“八字宪法”、实现大面积高额丰产创造了良好的条件。同时，广大农村干部响应了种试验田，参加生产、领导生产的号召。在这样有利形势下，干部试验田和群众丰产田结合在一起的丰产方就应运而生了。河北省各级党组织充分重视了这一个新生事物，及时地总结了开展丰产方运动的经验，并且在全省范围内普遍推广。1959年随着人民公社的发展和壮大，丰产方的面积由1958年的二百多万亩迅速增加到三千五百万亩，无论是平原、山区，也无论是粮食和经济作物，都是处处有方，样样有方，丰产方的红旗插遍了全省各地。
    公社化促进丰产方大发展
    人民公社为丰产方的发展开拓了无限广阔的前途。在1958年开始建设丰产方的时候，碰到了大大小小的很多矛盾，而矛盾的主要方面是原来的规模较小的经营单一的农业合作社不能适应高速度发展生产的要求。搞丰产方需要土地联片，而土质相同、地形适宜的土地，却分散在好几个农业社里；丰产方要打机井、买机器、大搞农田基本建设，而农业社人少、力量薄，一时组织不了大量的资金和劳动力。如此种种，都要求有一种新的规模更大的经营更广泛的生产组织，来解决农业社无力解决的问题。因此，人民公社的出现就像及时雨一样，滋润了丰产方这棵新生的幼芽，使它茁壮地成长起来。比如磁县成安人民公社，在1958年上半年开始划方经营的时候，联合了四个原农业合作社的力量，奋战了一春，才搞了三千亩。而成立人民公社之后，统一组织了工农商学兵等各方面的力量，三个月的时间，就挖渠道一百五十四道、打机井七十六眼、砖井千余眼，扩浇八万多亩地；同时通过统一规划，使各队的土地联片成方，实现了粮食、棉花、油料等各种作物的种植区域化。
    人民公社不仅推动了丰产方的生产建设，而且进一步加强了农业生产的组织性，提高了经营管理水平。各个人民公社在丰产方里组织了管理委员会、领导小组，建立了专业队，明确了责任制，特别是由于丰产方运动的深入开展，已经开始突破了以生产队为单位的小规模经营，而出现了队队联营、社队合营、公社经营等各种各样的经营管理形式，逐步向着大规模的集体经营发展。大的集体经营，人多力量大，筹集资金容易，便于开展多种经营，这就为统一规划农村建设和有计划地改造自然提供了更好的条件。这种大规模集体经营的发展，对于促进农业生产的连续大跃进，对于增加公社集体经济比重，从而促进人民公社由集体所有制向全民所有制的逐步过渡是有重大意义的。
    丰产方的成长并不是一帆风顺的。在刚刚开始建立丰产方的时候，就有人说搞方是闹形式，“有水有肥就能增产，有方没方还不是一样”；也有少数人怕搞方麻烦，怕人多心不齐，怕搞方增不了产，白搭工等等。总之，前怕龙，后怕虎，忧虑重重。根据这一情况，各地党组织首先抓住解决了思想问题。经过放手发动群众，开展了“怎样保证高速度发展农业生产，丰产方有哪些优越性，要不要搞丰产方，怎样搞法”为题的鸣放辩论，提高了广大群众的思想觉悟水平。大家认清了丰产方是一项改造小农经济耕作制度、建设社会主义大生产的革命，只有大搞丰产方，才能适应机械化、电气化的发展，才能更全面地执行农业“八字宪法”，才能更进一步提高产量。在这个基础上，又注意解决了经营形式、投资和分配、劳力组织等一系列的政策问题，从而大大鼓舞了广大群众的积极性，掀起了大搞丰产方的高潮。从1958年播种秋小麦开始，随着水利建设、深耕深翻、改良土壤、平整土地、大搞耕作园田化，全省共搞起小麦丰产方一千多万亩，方方都作到了地平埂直，灌排自如，区域种植，播种规格，管理细致。这个初步成果，更加鼓舞了广大群众的劳动热情，因此在1958年冬和1959年春，又冒严寒、破冻土，一举建成丰产方二千多万亩。这些丰产方，在农业生产继续大跃进中，发挥了显著的增产作用。全省丰产方的面积约占总播种面积的25％，而丰产方的产量可达到总产量的40％，所有的丰产方都比当地一般大田产量高出三成、五成以至一倍、两倍。
    耕作制度的大革命
    丰产方是社会主义的大生产、大建设，它的出现，有着重大的意义。丰产方不仅是把小块土地联成大块，也不仅仅是一项先进的耕作方法，而是一个耕作制度的大革命。我国农村在合作化以后，小农经济的生产关系已经不存在了，但地块零散，道路纵横，地势高洼不平，水地旱地插花，分散经营的耕作制度和耕作习惯仍然有着很深的根子，阻碍着大生产、大建设的发展。有了丰产方这种社会主义大生产的经营形式，就面貌全新了。丰产方把大面积的土地联结起来，就能够按照统一规划，打机井、开渠道，使农田水利建设的布局更加合理，就能够根据地形进行平整，并且按照不同的土质，实行区域种植和因地看土施肥，从而更有效地发掘了土地潜力；在相当的面积上种植同一种作物，耕作管理季节一致，更便于使用机械耕作和灌溉；同时便于实行计划种植，便于合理地组织劳动力，进行专业化管理，便于组织竞赛和检查生产。这就完全改变了小农经济的耕作制度，为发展社会主义的大生产铺平了道路。
    丰产方推动了农田基本建设，综合运用了农业“八字宪法”，因而实现了大跃进，大增产。划定了丰产方，就要在方内削岗填沟，平整土地，并根据地势合理地修渠打井，方内的不良土壤也要采取各种办法进行改良，因而促进了农田基本建设的发展。很多水旱地插花的地方，经过划方建设，已经全部成了水浇地，使低产田变成了高产田，高产田更高产，全面都高产。过去，在土地零星分散的情况下，虽然在耕作管理上，提出翻地深度、留苗密度、施肥数量、灌溉标准等要求，但要想全部按技术要求办事是有困难的。而丰产方就不一样了。丰产方田形整齐，畦田规格，一亩地留多少苗、施多少肥、浇多少水，都很容易计划和检查，特别是由于实行了区域种植，对实行机械操作有很大方便。1959年很多丰产方实行机械耕作，并且用飞机防治虫害，作到了省人工、效率高、省药又省钱。由于大搞农田基本建设，综合运用“八字宪法”，丰产方获得了巨大的丰收。安国县八十万亩地，1959年80％的土地都搞成丰产方，粮食亩产跃增到八百斤，比1958年增长35．3％。这县的伍仁桥公社的千亩丰产方，过去高洼不平，沟坑遍地，他们经过一个秋季的苦战，削掉了“卧龙岗”，填平了“蛤蟆坑”，全部修成了丰产方，1959年收了一季小麦、一季玉米，全年亩产达到一千八百多斤。成安人民公社的四万五千亩棉花方，有将近一半实行了机械耕作，由于他们在使用机器的同时，又注意了精细的耕作管理，获得了亩产皮棉一百八十斤的高额丰产，比1958年增长了80％。随着产量的迅速增长，农作物商品量也大大增加了，因此丰产方就成了商品生产基地。丰产方这种经营形式，在林、牧、副、渔等多种经营生产中，也正在普遍采用，大片丰产林、果树丰产沟，畜牧的丰产群，渔业的丰产塘、丰产船等等在全省到处出现了。丰产方在推动着农林牧副渔全线大革命的进展。
    丰产方不仅推动了农业生产的发展，而且也使农业科学技术大大向前发展了。人们为寻找更高产量的规律，在丰产方里大搞试验田、高产田、种子田。试验田就是丰产方的指挥田，各种增产措施，都由试验田先走一步，取得经验，再大面积推广，这样就大大推动了大面积丰产计划的实现。为着适应农业科学技术的发展，还以丰产方为单位组织了试验站、研究组，大兴群众办科学之风。1959年，全省群众进行的试验项目就有九千多项次，其中已有七百六十多项次获得了很大的成功。为了使理论和实践密切结合，丰产方内的红专学校也大办起来了。丰产方的管理专业队既是生产人员，又是研究人员，而且能者为师，互教互学，有效地提高了广大农民的科学技术水平，一支又红又专的农业科学技术队伍正在迅速地成长起来。要学技术，就要有文化，随着技术进方，文化也进了方。民兵练武、文化娱乐也都随着社员的要求进了方。就这样，丰产方又成了试验场，成了大课堂。
    搞起丰产方，自然面貌大大变了样。广阔方田一望无际，方内沟渠成网，方方道路相通。很多丰产方还在路旁渠旁栽种果树，渠塘内养鱼种藕，一方面大大美化了农村，同时，又丰富了多种经营的生产内容。很多丰产方在方内建立了猪场、肥料厂、农具修配站、气象观测组，还有的建立了方田食堂和休息棚，这就更加丰富了丰产方的建设，并且使社员在方内生产、生活更愉快、更方便。
    大搞丰产方，不仅使自然面貌变了样，各样庄稼增了产，而且也改变了人们的精神面貌。由分散的小生产转化到集体的大生产，首先大大增强了广大社员的集体主义思想和组织性、纪律性，由于丰产方的建设和经营管理，需要大协作，大支援，也进一步提高了人们的共产主义思想。由于丰产方的大建设、大生产、大丰收，冲破了束缚着人们的旧思想和习惯势力，使人们不再“听天由命”，这种由受制于自然提高到认识自然、改造自然的思想上的飞跃，就使广大群众更加积极地发挥出主观能动性，从而进一步发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格和苦干、实干、巧干的冲天革命干劲，推动农业生产以越来越高的速度前进。
    把丰产方推向更高水平
    1960年是大规模地进行现代化农业建设的第一年。为了保证1960年农业生产有一个更好更全面的大跃进，我们要本着“鼓足干劲，因地制宜，尽力而为，多多愈善”的精神，开展以大搞丰产方为中心的大面积高额丰产运动。水地要搞方，旱地也尽可能划方种植，作到山区、平原、沿海、草原、水地、旱地、远地、近地到处有方，粮、棉、油、菜以及其他各种作物各项生产样样有方，全省的丰产方面积力争达到播种总面积的一半以上，丰产方的产量力争超过当地大田作物产量的三成、五成以至一倍以上，使丰产方成为我省农业生产的主要的经营形式。建设丰产方是一个不断提高的过程，因此，应该不断地提高标准，使丰产方由小到大、由低级到高级地逐步发展提高。
    从去冬开始，结合以水利、积肥为中心的农田基本建设运动，丰产方已经在全省范围内轰轰烈烈地搞起来了。目前全省已经作好了田间工程。实现了园田化的丰产方有四千多万亩。在农田基本建设上，强调了利用土壤普查鉴定成果，按地形、土质和水源分布情况进行统一规划，等高平整，并补齐不够完善的田间工程，修建了田间道路，一般都作到了有水有渠，地平埂直，灌排自如，交通方便，为更好地运用“八字宪法”和逐步实现半机械化和机械化耕作创造了良好的条件。
    为了把大搞丰产方的运动推向一个新的阶段，在1960年，结合大搞丰产方，要大建方田猪场，大搞工具改革，以丰产方为基地进行机械化的试点工作。为加速实现一人一头猪、一亩地一头猪的宏伟目标，使畜牧生产和大规模的农业耕作结合起来，发展方田猪场是最好的形式之一。方田猪场，可以就地种饲料，就地用肥料，使庞大的运输任务大大减轻。同时，有条件的方田猪场可以利用田间设备的机械能源和电源，逐步实行生产过程半机械化和机械化，大大节省劳动力；猪只在方田饲养，有效地减少了疾病传染机会，保证猪只健壮生长；在播种前和收获后还可以进行放牧。总之，方田养猪，好处多得很。从去年入冬以来，我省养猪生产发展很快，方田猪场的建设也与日俱增，据最近的不完全统计，全省建设方田猪场已达十万个。
    丰产方要大搞农田基本建设，实行更高程度的精耕细作，确保年年稳定丰产，解决这个问题的根本出路在于实现农业机械化。立即着手进行试点，作好大发展的准备，是摆在面前的一项急迫任务。在1960年，我们将在实现机械化的重点地区，试建机械化丰产方，使耕作、排灌、运输等作业的机械化程度大大提高。其他地区也要把丰产方作为机械耕作的重点，以系统地总结机械配套、综合利用、经营管理和机械化与精耕细作的农艺要求相适应的经验。同时，大力发展农业科学技术教育事业，采用多种多样的方法，积极培养机械化的技术人员，以迎接机械化的大发展。
    一方面进行机械化试点，一方面要普遍地开展工具改革。大搞工具改革是实现半机械化、机械化的前奏，是解决当前劳动力的增长赶不上生产事业高速度发展的主要途径。特别是目前在以手工劳动为主的情况下，改革工具就有更重要的现实意义。丰产方在耕作管理上已经形成了比较完善的科学的制度，因此，工具改革也应该面向丰产方，根据丰产方的要求，系统地进行各个工序的工具全面改革，力争作到各项农活的各个工序全部使用新式农具和改良农具，以全面地提高劳动效率。
    要搞好丰产方，还必须坚持贯彻总路线，坚持不断革命和高速度跃进的思想，大鼓革命干劲，继续批判和克服“增产到顶”、“潜力有限”等各种右倾保守思想和小农经济耕作制度的习惯势力，使社会主义大生产更加发展和提高，使广大群众的革命积极性和创造性更加高涨。要进一步发扬群众路线的工作方法，大搞群众运动，特别是要大搞检查评比，插红旗，树标兵，开展比、学、赶、帮的携手赛。搞丰产方的目的是实现大面积高额丰产，这就必须群策群力，互相协作；另方面，丰产方内目标统一，行动一致，更便于互相学习、共同提高。提倡“勤俭办方”，使丰产方的长远建设和当前增产密切结合，逐步提高，同时要积极改善丰产方的经营管理，收到更高的经济效果。丰产方是一般田的旗帜，在加强丰产方领导的同时，还必须注意及时总结丰产方内的增产措施和经营管理经验，及时推广到一般田中去，发挥丰产方带动一般田全面增产的作用。
    向大地园林化迈进
    丰产方是极其可贵的新生事物。其可贵之处就在于：丰产方展示出了农业生产高速度发展的无限光明的前途，它的进一步发展、提高，将使我们向大地园林化的伟大目标迈进。丰产方面积由小到大，建设内容逐步增多，在高度的机械化和高度的精耕细作相结合的条件下，农作物产量将会成倍、几倍地增长，农业的大发展，也必然会促进林业、畜牧业以及其他多种经营生产的更大发展，整个农村的面貌将是无地不成方，渠路如蛛网，处处机器响，方田有工厂。广大农村将成为五谷丰登，六畜兴旺，绿树成荫，果挂枝头，鱼虾满塘，万紫千红的人间乐园。
