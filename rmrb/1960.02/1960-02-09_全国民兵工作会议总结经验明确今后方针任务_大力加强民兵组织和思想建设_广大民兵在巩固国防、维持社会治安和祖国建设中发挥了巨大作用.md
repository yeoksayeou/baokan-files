Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch: The National Militia Work Conference was recently held in Beijing. The conference discussed and summarized the achievements and experiences since the great upsurge of militia divisions in 1958, and made clear provisions for further strengthening militia construction and implementing the policy and tasks of the whole people running the militia in a big way in the future.

During the conference, Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman of the CPC Central Committee, and He Long and Chen Yi, members of the Central Political Bureau, received the conference representatives. Marshal He Long also made an important report at the meeting.

The conference conducted a full discussion on militia work and unanimously agreed that the mass armed forces are an important component of the revolutionary armed struggle led by our party, and that "the whole people are soldiers" is a manifestation of Chairman Mao's great thought on people's revolutionary war. The militia in our country has a long and glorious history and is a form of armed force welcomed by the broad masses of working people. The victory of our country's revolution was achieved by mobilizing, organizing, and arming the masses in accordance with Chairman Mao's strategic thinking. Today, running the militia in a big way by the whole people is of extremely great significance for opposing imperialist aggression, consolidating national defense, and accelerating socialist construction.

At the meeting, representatives of militia work from all over the country reported on the great achievements made by the urban and rural militias throughout the country in the struggle for land and sea border defense and in maintaining social order since Chairman Mao called for a great upsurge of militia divisions in 1958, as well as the great role they have played in socialist construction.

On the long land and sea border defense lines, the militia generally organized joint defense with the local garrison troops, and worked side by side to take on the glorious task of defending the motherland. The militia on the Fujian front bravely supported and cooperated with the People's Liberation Army to launch a mass struggle against the enemy, effectively打击 (dǎjī - to strike, crack down on) the Chiang army on the islands of Jinmen and Matsu. The militia on the Yunnan border actively assisted the Liberation Army in打击 (dǎjī - to strike, crack down on) the Chiang Kai-shek's troops who fled from Burma and harassed the border. Li Zhaguo, a Lahu ethnic minority militiaman, twice used his wits to capture more than a dozen Kuomintang agents. The vast inland militia carried out the task of protecting bridges, railways, warehouses, factories, mines and forests, and assisted public security organs in maintaining social order. The militia in the mountainous areas also organized hunting teams to protect production and the safety of people and livestock. In the first half of last year alone, the militia in eighteen provinces and autonomous regions, including Jilin, Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, Gansu, Yunnan, and Guizhou, eliminated more than 7.49 million harmful beasts and birds, such as tigers and leopards.

In participating in socialist construction, militias in various places have demonstrated high political enthusiasm and soaring vigor, serving as backbones and shock brigades. Whether participating in industrial and agricultural production, or in rescue and disaster relief, or in the technical revolution and technical innovation, they have made contributions and demonstrated the great power of the militia organization. In order to complete the task of producing blowers, the Hefei Mining Machinery Factory in Anhui Province held a militia oath-taking rally. Under the slogan of "The factory is the battlefield, the machine is the sword and gun," the militiamen were full of vigor and completed the task with a threefold overfulfillment. On the agricultural front, the militia actively participated in water conservancy construction, deep plowing of land, accumulation of fertilizer, mountain management and afforestation, and spring planting and autumn harvesting, repeatedly showing their skills. The Yan'an militia, which has a glorious tradition, newly built and renovated more than 2,200 large and small water conservancy projects and managed 65 mountains in more than two months last winter, together with the people of the entire region. A certain militia division, which was responsible for building a 100-li-long canal, worked hard and studied diligently, offered suggestions, and built dozens of self-made cement, lime, and gunpowder factories in the absence of materials and equipment, from the division commander to each militiaman, overcoming difficulties, accelerating the progress of the project, and saving the country more than 480,000 yuan. Under the slogan of "hard work plus smart work," they also created and reformed 750 tools, increasing efficiency by at least two times and up to 31 times. Militias in various places have all strived to go to the front line and fought day and night in the struggle against drought and flood prevention. When Yangzhong Township in Ningde County, Fujian Province, was hit by typhoons and rainstorms, the militia formed 16 militia rescue teams and 15 patrol teams, fighting wind and rain day and night. When the dike breached, militia Zhou Changshu jumped into the rapids regardless of his own safety and blocked the breach with his body, preventing the loss of a large amount of late rice.

"Combining labor and military affairs" and "being able to write and fight" are the glorious traditions of our country's militia. Militias in various places have carried out activities of studying culture and practicing military skills while subordinating themselves to production, so that their own political, military, and cultural levels have been continuously improved. In the "Great Leap Forward in production, striving for excellence in training" competition, the militia on the Fujian front quickly completed the planned military and political subjects training. Thousands of men and women militiamen achieved an overall "good" result in political tests and live ammunition shooting assessments with rifles and machine guns. The militia of many factories, schools, hospitals and other units carried out special technical training in combination with their own specialties. Education on communism and the glorious traditions of the people's army and the militia is often carried out among the militia in various places, constantly improving the political awareness and revolutionary vigor of the militia. The militia in many areas have also actively set up clubs, reading rooms, exhibition halls, and amateur cultural troupes, vigorously carried out mass sports activities, and actively participated in national defense sports. The militia have given full play to their backbone role in cultural and sports activities in rural areas and factories and mines, making the life of the militia richer, more colorful, and more lively.

Our country's militia organization has developed and grown unprecedentedly under the new historical conditions, fully embodying Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions that the militia is a military organization, a labor organization, an educational organization, and a sports organization, and has played a huge role in all aspects. All the representatives present at the meeting unanimously believed that the militia system is very good, and they are determined to hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong's military thought, continue to vigorously strengthen the organizational construction and ideological construction of the militia, and make the national militia work develop more vigorously.

    新华社8日讯　最近在北京举行了全国民兵工作会议。会议讨论和总结了1958年大办民兵师以来的成绩和经验，并对今后进一步加强民兵建设和贯彻全民大办民兵的方针任务，作了明确规定。
    会议期间，中共中央副主席周恩来，中央政治局委员贺龙、陈毅接见了会议代表。贺龙元帅还在会上作了重要报告。
    会议对民兵工作进行了充分的讨论，一致认为，群众武装是我们党所领导的革命武装斗争的一个重要组成部分，“全民皆兵”是毛主席的伟大的人民革命战争思想的体现。民兵在我国具有悠久的光荣历史，是为广大劳动人民喜闻乐见的武装形式。我国革命的胜利，就是根据毛主席的战略思想，发动群众、组织群众和武装群众所取得的；今天全民大办民兵，对反对帝国主义侵略、巩固国防和加速社会主义建设，都有极其重大的意义。
    会上，来自全国各地的民兵工作代表，汇报了从1958年毛主席号召大办民兵师以来，全国城乡民兵在陆海边防斗争中和维持社会治安中作出的巨大成就，以及他们在社会主义建设中所发挥的巨大作用。
    在漫长的陆海边防线上，民兵普遍和当地驻军组织了联防，并肩携手担当起保卫祖国的光荣任务。福建前线的民兵，英勇地支援和配合人民解放军，展开了群众性的对敌斗争，有力地打击了金门、马祖等岛屿上的蒋军。云南边防线上的民兵，积极协助解放军打击了越境窜扰的逃缅蒋军。拉祜族民兵李扎果，两次用计捕捉国民党特务十多名。内地广大民兵执行了保护桥梁、铁路、仓库、厂矿和森林等任务，协助公安机关维护了社会治安。山区的民兵还组织了打猎队，保卫了生产和人畜的安全。仅吉林、黑龙江、陕西、甘肃、云南、贵州等十八个省和自治区的民兵，去年上半年就消灭虎、豹等害兽以及害鸟七百四十九万多只。
    各地民兵在参加社会主义建设中，表现了高度的政治热情和冲天的干劲，是骨干又是突击队。无论参加工农业生产、抢险救灾，还是在技术革命和技术革新方面，都作出了贡献，显示了民兵组织的巨大威力。安徽省合肥市矿山机械厂为了完成生产鼓风机的任务，召开民兵誓师大会，民兵们在“工厂当战场，机器当刀枪”的口号下，意气昂扬，超额三倍完成了任务。在农业战线上，民兵积极参加水利建设、深翻土地、积肥造肥、治山造林和春种秋收等工作，屡显身手。有着光荣传统的延安民兵，在去年冬天两个多月的时间里，和全区人民一道新修和改修大小水利工程两千二百多项，治山六十五座。担负修建长达一百华里水渠的某民兵师，在缺乏物资器材的情况下，从师长到每个民兵，刻苦钻研、献计献策，自建了几十个自制水泥、石灰、火药的工厂，克服了困难，加快了工程进度，并且给国家节约资金四十八万多元。在“苦干加巧干”的口号下，他们还创造和改革工具七百五十件，提高工效最少的两倍，最多的达到三十一倍。各地民兵在抗旱防洪斗争中，都争上前线，日夜奋战。福建省宁德县洋中乡民兵，在当地遭受台风、暴雨袭击时，组成了十六个民兵抢险队和十五个巡逻队，日夜和风雨搏斗。堤坝决口时，民兵周昌输奋不顾身地跳入激流，用身体堵住决口，使大量晚稻避免损失。
    “劳武结合”、“能文能武”，是我国民兵的光荣传统。各地民兵在服从生产的情况下，开展了习文练武活动，使自身的政治、军事、文化水平，不断得到了提高。福建前线民兵在“生产大跃进，训练争优秀”的竞赛中，很快地完成了预定军政课目的训练，成千上万的男女民兵在政治测验和步枪、机枪实弹射击考核中，总评成绩“良好”。许多工厂、学校、医院等单位的民兵，结合自己的专业进行了特种技术的训练。在各地民兵中经常进行共产主义以及人民军队和民兵光荣传统的教育，不断地提高民兵的政治觉悟和革命干劲。许多地区的民兵还积极兴办俱乐部、阅览室、展览馆和业余文工团，大力开展群众性的体育活动，并积极参加国防体育。在农村和厂矿的文化体育活动中，民兵充分发挥了骨干作用，使民兵的生活更加丰富多采、生动活泼。
    我国的民兵组织，在新的历史条件下已空前发展壮大，充分体现了毛主席关于民兵是军事组织、又是劳动组织，又是教育组织，又是体育组织的英明指示，在各方面都起了巨大作用。全体到会代表一致认为，民兵制度好得很，决心高举毛主席军事思想的红旗，继续大力加强民兵组织建设和思想建设，使全国民兵工作更加蓬勃地发展起来。
