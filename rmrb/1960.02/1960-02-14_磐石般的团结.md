    Rock-Solid Unity
    Qian Xuesen, Director of the Institute of Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences
    Ten years ago today, the People's Republic of China had only been established for four and a half months. Many of our recovery and construction efforts were just beginning. At this time, the Soviet Union, our big brother in the socialist camp, extended a helping hand to us and signed the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, embodying the unbreakable and eternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. For ten years, this treaty of alliance and mutual assistance has been the guarantee of the prosperity and development of our two countries; and because the parties that lead our two countries are Marxist-Leninist parties, parties for world peace and the liberation of mankind, the Sino-Soviet alliance is also a guarantee of world peace and human progress. Facts fully confirm this assertion. We say that the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is glorious and great, and it is an example of a new relationship between the people of one country and the people of another under the socialist system; it seems to be saying to the people of the whole world: Look! Between our new socialist countries, the relationship between countries can be truly friendly and mutually supportive, supporting each other like brothers.
    Naturally, the establishment of this new rock-solid unity is not accidental. Because our countries are all countries that practice the proletarian dictatorship, countries where the working people are the masters of their own affairs, we can unite as one. All this cannot be understood by the rulers of capitalist countries, the capitalists, and the lackeys of the capitalists. How can those who are trapped in the quagmire of capitalist thought understand the affairs of our socialist society! But this group of stupid people is malicious; they see the great power generated by the unity in the socialist camp, and they are afraid of our power and hate our power. They try every means to destroy our unity and painstakingly try to provoke friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union! For ten years, these leaders of the capitalist world have not rested for a day, constantly spreading rumors and slanders, and constantly trying to find loopholes; but how can a dragonfly shake a rock? After ten years of meddling, they have not moved the slightest bit of Sino-Soviet friendship, and it is destined to fail even if they meddle for another hundred years.
    Seeing that their attempts to sow discord have not succeeded, and that the socialist camp is becoming increasingly strong, especially in the recent period, the Soviet Union has achieved world-shaking achievements in science and technology, and China has achieved comprehensive great leap forward results under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line. This has made the planners of U.S. imperialism panic and realize that they have been reduced to second-class countries. But they are still unwilling to die, and they are whimsical, hypocritically shouting "peace," while desperately preparing for war, accelerating the development of weapons such as missiles and rockets, and signing aggressive military agreements like the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." But the eyes of our people are discerning, and how can the conspiracies of the Eisenhower clique deceive us? We know that the new tricks of the U.S. rulers are nothing more than trying to achieve the goals that they could not achieve in the old tricks. How can they truly want peace! Peace and imperialism are forever incompatible!

    磐石般的团结
    中国科学院力学研究所所长　钱学森
    在十年前的今天，中华人民共和国才不过诞生了四个半月。我们的许多恢复工作和建设工作正在开始，就在这时候，我们社会主义阵营的老大哥苏联，向我们伸出了援助的手，同我们签订了友好同盟互助条约，体现了中苏两国人民之间的牢不可破的、永恒的友谊。十年来这个同盟互助条约是我们中苏两国繁荣发展的保证；而且因为领导我们两国的党是马克思列宁主义的党，是为了世界和平和人类解放的党，所以中苏同盟也是世界和平和人类进步的保障。事实充分证实这种论断。我们说中苏友好同盟互助条约是光辉伟大的，它是一国人民和另一国人民在社会主义制度下新的关系的范例；它好像对全世界人民在说：看！在我们新的社会主义国家之间，国和国的关系可以真正的友好互助，像兄弟一样地相互支援。
    自然，建立像这种新的磐石般的团结并不是偶然的。因为我们的国家都是实行无产阶级专政的国家，是劳动人民当家作主的国家；所以能够团结一致，这一切自然不是资本主义国家的统治者、资本家们和资本家的走狗们所能理解的。我们这社会主义社会里的事，陷在资本主义思想的泥坑里的人怎能通晓！但是这群愚蠢的人是恶毒的；他们看到由于社会主义阵营中的团结而产生的伟大力量，一面怕我们的力量，一面恨我们的力量；他们就千方百计地想破坏我们的团结，苦心积虑地想挑拨中苏两国之间的友好关系！十年来这些资本主义世界中的头子们一天也没有休息，一直在造谣诽谤，一直在想钻我们的空子；但是蜻蜓怎能摇得动磐石，搞了十年没有动得中苏友好的一毫一丝，再搞一百年也是注定要落空的。
    眼看搞挑拨离间不成功，而社会主义阵营国家日益强大，特别是近一个时期，苏联在科学技术中取得震撼全世界的成就，中国在党的总路线光辉照耀下取得全面大跃进的成绩，这就使得美帝国主义的策划者惊惶失措，认识到他们已经沦为二等国家。但它们还临死不甘心，又异想天开，假惺惺地大叫“和平”，而一面却拼命备战，加快导弹、火箭等武器的发展，签订侵略性的军事协定像日美“安全条约”。可是我们人民的眼睛是雪亮的，艾森豪威尔之流的阴谋诡计怎能瞒得过我们，我们知道美国统治者们的新把戏无非是想达到他们在旧把戏中所不能达到的目的而已，哪会是真想要和平！和平同帝国主义，永远是水火不相容的！
