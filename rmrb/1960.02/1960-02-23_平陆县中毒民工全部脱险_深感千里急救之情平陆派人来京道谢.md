All Poisoned Workers in Pinglu County Out of Danger
Deeply Moved by the Thousand-Li Rescue, Pinglu Sends Representatives to Beijing to Express Gratitude

    (Our report) All sixty-one workers from Zhangdianying, Fengnan Highway, Pinglu County, Shanxi Province, who suffered severe poisoning, have now been rescued and are out of danger thanks to the vigorous efforts of all parties and meticulous treatment.
    After the poisoning incident occurred, in addition to the enthusiastic assistance from the Ministry of Health, the Air Force Headquarters, the Beijing Baminacao Special Medicine Store, and the Wuzhou Electrical Materials Store, the Shanxi Provincial People's Hospital and the Yuncheng Central Hospital sent their best doctors for treatment, and the Yuncheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office also sent a prevention and treatment team. The Zhangdian Commune, treating the workers as if they were its own members, mobilized all twenty-eight medical personnel in the commune to take full responsibility for the treatment, and allocated fine grains and vegetables to improve the patients' living conditions. The medical staff treated the patients like their own relatives, washing their clothes, washing their feet, and cutting their nails, showing meticulous care and embodying the great spirit of saving lives and healing the wounded, and revolutionary humanitarianism. People's communes throughout the county called to express their condolences and concern; the Pinglu County Cultural Troupe also rushed to the scene to offer comfort performances. This fully embodies the great communist style of the people's soldiers and people's servants armed with Mao Zedong Thought.
    After rescue and treatment, all sixty-one poisoned workers have been rescued. Fifty-six patients with mild symptoms have been cured and have returned to production. The health of the five more severely ill patients has also improved. To express their gratitude to the Party and the government for their concern, the rescued workers have written letters of gratitude to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. The old worker Zhang Guangxiu said: "The Party and Chairman Mao are our saviors, even closer than our parents." All the workers in the county were extremely inspired and pledged to overfulfill their production plans, launching a competition that greatly improved work efficiency.
    Recently, the Pinglu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County People's Committee sent representatives to Beijing to express their gratitude to the Ministry of Health, the Air Force Headquarters, the Baminacao Special Medicine Store, and a certain flight crew who had traveled thousands of miles to deliver medicine and save the lives of the sixty-one poisoned workers. They also presented four banners and some local specialties to the above four units. The banner presented to the Air Force flight crew read: People's soldiers love the people, traveling thousands of miles at night to rescue patients.

    深感千里急救之情平陆派人来京道谢
    本报讯　山西省平陆县凤南公路张店营严重中毒的六十一个民工，经过各方面的大力抢救和细心治疗现已全部脱险。
    民工中毒事件发生后，除了卫生部、空军司令部、北京市八面槽特种药品商店和五洲电料行等单位，给予了热情的援助外，山西省人民医院、运城中心医院都派了最好的医生前往治疗，运城专署也派去了防治队。张店公社像对待自己社员一样，调动了全社二十八名医务人员，包干治疗，并拨细粮、蔬菜，改善患者生活。医务人员把患者当亲人，给患者洗衣、洗脚、剪指甲，体贴入微，照顾备至，发挥了高度的救死扶伤、革命人道主义精神。全县人民公社纷纷打电话进行慰问，表示关切；平陆县文工团也赶到出事地点，进行慰问演出。充分体现了以毛泽东思想武装起来的人民子弟兵、人民勤务员的伟大的共产主义风格。
    经过抢救和治疗，六十一名中毒民工已全部脱险。轻患者五十六人已治愈，并已参加生产。五个较重的患者，健康情况也有好转。为了感谢党和政府对他们的关怀，被抢救的民工，纷纷给党中央和毛主席写感谢信。民工张光秀老汉说：“党和毛主席是咱们的救命恩人，比爹娘还亲。”全县民工无比振奋，纷纷保证超额完成生产计划，展开了竞赛，工效大大提高。
    最近，中共山西平陆县委和县人民委员会，派代表来到北京，向曾经千里送药救活六十一名中毒民工的卫生部、空军司令部、八面槽特种药品商店和某飞行机组表示感谢。并把四面锦旗和一些土特产品分赠以上四个单位。在赠给空军某飞行机组的锦旗上写道：人民战士热爱人民，夜行万里抢救病人。
