Xinhua News Agency, 13th—To celebrate the tenth anniversary of the signing the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Commission on Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and the Ministry of Culture held a film reception this morning in Beijing, screening the large-scale documentary "Great Friendship," which records the profound friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union.

The entire delegation of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, headed by Yelyutin, Vice Chairman of the Council of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association and Minister of Higher and Secondary Specialized Education of the Soviet Union, who came to China to participate in the celebrations of the tenth anniversary, attended the reception and were warmly welcomed by the attendees.

Before the screening of the film, Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, spoke. He said that we are pleased to see that in the past ten years, the cause of friendship and unity between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union has greatly developed, and the construction undertakings of China and the Soviet Union have achieved brilliant victories. In particular, the Soviet Union has fully launched communist construction and has far surpassed the United States in the most important fields of science and technology. For ten years, China and the Soviet Union have been closely united as always, and have comprehensively developed mutual assistance and cooperation between the two countries on the basis of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, which has not only powerfully promoted the common upsurge of the construction undertakings of China and the Soviet Union, but also made great contributions to world peace and human progress. The rock-solid unity of the eight hundred and fifty million people of China and the Soviet Union has greatly enhanced the advantage of the socialist camp and powerfully encouraged and supported the national revolutionary forces and democratic forces of the world. Qian Junrui finally emphasized that the unity and strength of China and the Soviet Union and the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union will certainly be able to defeat all the conspiracies of the war forces headed by US imperialism, and enable our common cause to achieve even greater victories.

Tsikhvinsky, member of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association delegation, member of the Council of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, and Director of the Institute of Chinese Studies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, then spoke on behalf of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association delegation. He first greeted the Chinese comrades and all friends present in Chinese. He enthusiastically reviewed the road of friendship that the peoples of the Soviet Union and China have traveled. He said that the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed in Moscow ten years ago opened up infinitely broad avenues for the development of our two countries' friendship. The "Great Friendship" film screened at this meeting today will encourage and call on us to continue to develop and consolidate the friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China. He finally shouted in Chinese: I wish you all new achievements in developing and consolidating the unbreakable friendship between the Soviet Union and China.

The speeches of Qian Junrui and Tsikhvinsky won rounds of warm applause.

Among those attending the film reception were Huang Yanpei, Liao Chengzhi, Li Dequan, Shao Lizi, Vice Presidents of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association; Zeng Yongquan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs; Zhang Zhixiang, Deputy Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and other responsible persons. Soviet Embassy Counselor in China, Sudarikov, heads of diplomatic missions and diplomatic officials from socialist brother countries to China, and some Soviet and brother countries' experts and guests in Beijing were also invited to attend the reception.

The large-scale documentary "Great Friendship," which was screened today, was produced by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio as a gift to the tenth anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Alliance. A series of vivid shots in the film truly reflect the deep friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union at various stages of revolutionary history.
