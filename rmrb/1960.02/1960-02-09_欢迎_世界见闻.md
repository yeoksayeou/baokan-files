    Welcome "World Events"
    Liu Guangfu

    Every time I watch the newsreel "World Events", I am left with a deep impression. Many comrades around me also praise this type of film, because it is highly politically and ideologically significant, short and concise, lively and interesting. I am a People's Liberation Army soldier guarding a southeastern island of the motherland, and the film takes us to tour the world. From "The Face of Paris", we saw the darkness and decay of capitalist society, and witnessed firsthand the clubs of the warmongers in Paris. "World Events" No. 6 realistically and vividly contrasted socialist and capitalist countries, one side with infinite brightness and the other with complete darkness; we are like the rising sun, thriving and prosperous, while capitalist countries are like the setting sun, at the end of their rope. Such films encourage us to defend peace and build our socialist motherland, and further strengthen the fighting spirit of every soldier on the motherland's coastal defense. We eagerly hope to see more of such films.

    欢迎“世界见闻”
    刘广福
    每次看新闻片——“世界见闻”，都给我留下了很深的印象。我周围的很多同志也很赞美这一片种。因为它政治思想性高，又短小精悍，生动有趣。我是一个守卫在祖国东南海岛上的解放军战士，影片带着我们游览了全世界。我们从“巴黎的面貌”里，看到了资本主义社会的黑暗和腐朽，亲眼目睹了巴黎好战分子的俱乐部。“世界见闻”第六号真实地、鲜明地对照了社会主义和资本主义国家，一面是无限光明和一面是一片黑暗；我们是如旭日东升，欣欣向荣，资本主义国家则是日薄西山，穷途末路。这样的影片鼓舞了我们保卫和平，建设社会主义祖国的力量，更坚定了祖国海防上每一个战士的斗志。我们殷切地希望多看到这样的影片。
