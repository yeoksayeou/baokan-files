    Liao Chengzhi, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, said in his speech, "Crushing the new aggression and war conspiracy planned by the US imperialists and Japanese militarists in the Far East is not only the task of the Japanese people, but also the common task of the people of all countries in Asia and the world." "The Chinese people have always deeply sympathized with and resolutely supported the just struggle of the Japanese people, and will continue to resolutely support it in the future." Yasui Kaoru emphasized in his speech, "Although the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet forcibly concluded a new treaty despite the people's protests, the Japanese people's struggle to prevent the revision of the US-Japan 'Security Treaty' has not lost its significance as a result. It will ignite a greater fire for the struggle to smash the US-Japan 'Security Treaty System'." He also said: "We are convinced that united with peace-loving comrades all over the world, the Japanese people's struggle will overcome all obstacles and achieve brilliant victory."
