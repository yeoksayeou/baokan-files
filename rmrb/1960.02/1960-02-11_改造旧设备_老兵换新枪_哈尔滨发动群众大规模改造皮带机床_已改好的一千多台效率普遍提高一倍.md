Xinhua News Agency, Harbin Electric - Harbin is witnessing a mass movement in old and small factories to transform belt-driven lathes, fully tapping the potential of old equipment. Currently, over 1,000 belt-driven lathes city-wide have been technically upgraded into semi-automatic machine tools, with one now doing the work of two. The workers in various factories are filled with confidence and aim to convert all of the city's 2,700-plus belt-driven lathes into new, semi-automatic machines in the first quarter of the year.

Many old factories in Harbin, especially local industrial factories, use belt-driven lathes that have generally undergone twenty to forty years of wear and tear. They are slow, inefficient, and cannot guarantee the precision of processed parts, making it difficult to adapt to the needs of high-speed production development. Therefore, transforming these belt-driven lathes has become a major aspect of Harbin's efforts to promote mechanization and automation. After modification, these machine tools can not only increase their speed and cutting depth, but also significantly improve their precision.

The technical transformation of belt-driven lathes also creates conditions for further achieving single-machine automation and automated production lines, as well as adopting advanced processing methods such as high-speed cutting and multi-tool, multi-edge cutting. The Songjiang Electric Furnace Factory transformed a modified belt-driven lathe into an automatically controlled machine tool, enabling one machine to do the work of eighteen machines in the past.

    改造旧设备　老兵换新枪
    哈尔滨发动群众大规模改造皮带机床
    已改好的一千多台效率普遍提高一倍
    据新华社哈尔滨电　哈尔滨市一些老厂小厂正在开展群众性的改造皮带机床运动，充分挖掘旧设备的潜力。目前全市已有一千多台皮带机床，经过技术改造变成了半自动化机床，一台可顶原来的两台用。各工厂职工满怀信心，要在第一季度内把全市二千七百多台皮带机床全部改装成半自动化的新式机床。
    哈尔滨的许多老工厂，尤其是地方工业工厂使用的皮带机床，一般都经过了二十年到四十几年的磨损，速度慢，效率低，加工部件精密度也不能保证，很难适应生产高速度发展的需要。因此，改造这些皮带机床，就成为哈尔滨市大搞机械化、自动化的一个主要方面。这些机床改装后，不仅可以使机床的转速加快，切削深度加深，设备的精度也可以大大提高。
    对皮带机床进行技术改造，还为进一步实现单机自动化和自动化生产线，以及采用高速切削、多刀多刃切削等先进加工方法创造了条件。松江电炉厂把一台改装后的皮带机床改造成自动控制机床，使一台机床能干过去十八台机床的活。
