Xinhua News Agency, Tonghua, February 15th. The 1960 National Skiing Games successfully concluded in Tonghua City on the evening of the 15th after seven days of intense competition. This competition demonstrated the rapid improvement of skiing techniques and the growth of new forces in China's skiing sport.

Most of the competitions were held on hilly, steep, and complex terrain. Due to the improved technical level of the athletes, many excellent results were achieved in the competition. The results of the speed skiing championships for adult men and women, as well as for young men and women, were generally much higher than the previous best results in the same events in national competitions.

Half of the four hundred skiers participating in the competition were attending a national competition for the first time. However, they achieved many good results. Six of the top ten in the adult women's downhill competition were newcomers; all of the top six in the junior men's downhill were newcomers. Quan Yushun from the Mudanjiang team, who won the junior women's three-kilometer and five-kilometer skiing championships, was participating in a national competition for the first time, but her five-kilometer skiing result was more than three minutes faster than the 1957 adult men's five-kilometer skiing champion.

The physical strength and skiing techniques of the athletes participating in this competition have also greatly improved compared to the past.

The team with the highest overall score in this competition was Jilin City. The following rankings were Tonghua City, Mudanjiang City, Jiamusi City, Hulunbuir League of Inner Mongolia, and the Shenyang Troops of the People's Liberation Army.

Jilin City is one of the cities in China with a better development of mass skiing. All thirty-eight athletes participating in this competition have relatively advanced skiing techniques and relatively strong strength. This team won the runner-up and champion respectively in the 1957 and 1958 National Skiing Competitions. Nearly half of the twenty-four championships in this competition were won by them, and the total score was 430.6 points.

The final event of the conference, the adult men's 50-kilometer speed skiing competition, was also held today. Gao Jixi, a player from Tonghua City, won the championship with a time of three hours, thirty-two minutes, and thirty-seven seconds.

    全国滑雪运动会胜利闭幕
    新华社通化15日电1960年全国滑雪运动会经过七天的紧张比赛，于15日晚在通化市胜利闭幕。这次比赛，显示了我国滑雪运动技术水平的迅速提高和新生力量的成长壮大。
    绝大部分的比赛项目，是在山丘多、坡度大、地形复杂的场地上进行的。由于运动员技术水平提高，比赛中创造了很多优异成绩。成年男女和少年男女速度滑雪各项冠军的成绩，普遍比历次全国性比赛中，同一项目第一名的成绩提高了很多。
    参加比赛的四百名滑雪运动员中，有一半是第一次出席全国性比赛。但是，他们创造了许多良好成绩。成年女子快速降下比赛的前十名中，有六名是新手；少年男子快速降下前六名，全是新手。牡丹江队获得少年女子三公里、五公里滑雪两项冠军的权玉顺，是初次参加全国性比赛，但是她的五公里滑雪成绩比1957年成年男子五公里滑雪冠军的成绩还快三分多钟。
    参加这次比赛的运动员的体力和滑行技术，也比过去大有提高。
    这次比赛的团体总分冠军为吉林市获得。以下的名次是通化市，牡丹江市，佳木斯市，内蒙古呼伦贝尔盟和解放军沈阳部队。
    吉林市是我国群众性滑雪运动开展较好的城市之一。参加这次比赛的三十八名运动员，都有比较先进的滑行技术，实力比较雄厚。这个队在1957年、1958年全国滑雪比赛中，曾分别获得亚、冠军。这次比赛的二十四项冠军有近一半被他们夺去，总成绩是四三○点六分。
    今天还进行了大会最后一项成年男子五十公里速度滑雪比赛。获得冠军的通化市选手高基锡，成绩是三小时三十二分三十七秒。
