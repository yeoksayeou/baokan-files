Collective Helps Collective—Socialist Obligation

Soviet Tractor Factory Decides to Adopt Various Measures to Help Brother Factory Become an Advanced Enterprise

    This newspaper reports that the Soviet "Labor News" published an article on February 18th entitled "Collective Helps Collective," which introduced the advanced deeds of the Stalingrad Tractor Factory in helping the Stalingrad "Gas Equipment Factory." Due to this assistance, the reconstruction cost of the "Gas Equipment Factory" was reduced by more than two-thirds, and this year it can reach the 1965 production level stipulated in the original reconstruction plan. This is a remarkable deed of an advanced collective helping a backward collective that emerged in the Gaganova movement of advanced workers helping backward workers in the Soviet Union.

    The "Labor News" article said that Gaganova opened up a universal truth with her noble actions: In order to make the common cause go well, one must help those who need help. People bravely followed her example. But if the help of one person is valuable, then a collective will achieve greater results. Why doesn't one factory extend a helping hand to another factory? This point is being talked about everywhere. At the meeting of activists of the Stalingrad Tractor Factory, this assistance was regarded as a socialist obligation of the factory's workers. They formed the idea: "In order to develop the initiative of the socialist labor hero Gaganova, which was praised by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the collective of the Stalingrad Tractor Factory decided to obligatorily help the collective of the Stalingrad 'Gas Equipment Factory.' The many years of production technology experience of the tractor factory workers will be of great benefit to the young collective of the 'Gas Equipment Factory.' We will help it adopt new technologies and advanced technological procedures, realize the mechanization and automation of the production process, and better organize labor, so that it can transform from a backward enterprise into an advanced enterprise."

    The article continued, the "Gas Equipment Factory" is a new enterprise. It was established by the National Economic Council not long ago on the basis of local industry to meet the residents' needs for gas equipment. The employees of this factory are all newcomers, and they feel insufficient in many things. The workers of the tractor factory enthusiastically took on the new work. This issue was discussed at the factory director's meetings, factory committee meetings, and workshop meetings. Everyone considered how to provide assistance.

    Engineering and technical personnel helped the "Gas Equipment Factory" revise the reconstruction design plan.

    According to the new plan, the cost of basic construction can be reduced from 37 million rubles to 12.28 million rubles, a reduction of more than two-thirds, and the most important thing is that it can reach the 1965 production level planned in the original plan this year.

    The article mentioned that the various workshops of the tractor factory actively provided enthusiastic assistance to the "Gas Equipment Factory" in terms of supplying technical data, helping to design new technological processes, reducing processing procedures, supplying equipment, and a large number of cutting tools and gauges. In particular, many experienced veteran workers and workers who enjoy the title of "Excellent Workers of the Tractor Factory" have set a noble example and provided assistance in all aspects. In order to help the new factory solve the cadre problem, excellent engineers from the tractor factory, Demichev, economic engineer Dedkova, technician Zernov, and some others volunteered to work in the "Gas Equipment Factory." In addition, the trade union cadres of the two factories also frequently exchanged experiences to help the new factory establish a band and carry out amateur cultural activities.

    The article concluded that the tractor factory completed its plan ahead of schedule in 1959 and put forward greater guarantees in 1960. One of the new and extraordinary guarantees—helping the "Gas Equipment Factory" become an advanced factory—will definitely be completed.

    集体帮助集体—社会主义的义务
    苏联一拖拉机工厂决定采取种种措施帮助兄弟工厂成为先进企业
    本报讯　苏联“劳动报”2月18日发表一篇题为“集体帮助集体”的文章，介绍了斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂帮助斯大林格勒“煤气设备厂”的先进事迹。由于这种帮助，使得“煤气设备厂”的改建费用节省三分之二以上，并且在今年就可以达到原改建方案规定的1965年生产水平。这是在苏联先进工人帮助后进工人的加干诺娃运动中涌现出来的先进集体帮助后进集体的引人注目的事迹。
    “劳动报”的文章说，加干诺娃曾以自己高尚的行动打开了一个普遍的真理：为了使共同的事业进行得好，就要去帮助需要帮助的人。人们勇敢地追随她的榜样。但是如果一个人的帮助是可贵的，那末一个集体就会做出更大的成绩。为什么一个工厂不向另一个工厂伸出援助的手呢？这一点到处都在讲，在斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂的积极分子会议上，这种援助被认为是全厂工人的社会主义义务，他们形成了这样的思想：“为了把苏共中央六月全会所赞扬的社会主义劳动英雄加干诺娃的创举加以发展，斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂集体决定义务帮助斯大林格勒‘煤气设备厂’的集体。拖拉机厂工人多年的生产技术经验对‘煤气设备厂’的年青的集体将有很大的益处。我们帮助它采用新的技术和先进的工艺程序，实现生产过程的机械化和自动化，更好地组织劳动，使它从落后企业成为先进企业”。
    文章接着说，“煤气设备厂”是一个新的企业。它是国民经济委员会不久以前为了满足居民对煤气设备的需要而在地方工业的基础上建立的。这个工厂的职工都是新手，许多东西都感觉到不足。拖拉机厂职工热烈地担负起了新的工作。在厂长会议上、在工厂委员会会议上、在车间会议上都谈论着这个问题。大家都考虑如何来进行帮助。
    工程技术人员帮助“煤气设备厂”修改了改建设计方案。
    按照新方案，可使基本建设费用从三千七百万卢布减少到一千二百二十八万卢布，即减少三分之二以上，而最主要的还是使得今年就可以达到原方案所规划的1965年的生产水平。
    文章谈到，在供应技术资料、帮助设计新的工艺过程、减少加工工序、供应设备和大批切削工具、量具夹具等方面，拖拉机厂各个车间都积极给予“煤气设备厂”以热情的帮助。特别是许多有经验的老工人，享有“拖拉机厂优秀工人”称号的工人，都作出了崇高榜样，从各个方面提供帮助。为了帮助新厂解决干部问题，拖拉机厂的优秀工程师杰米切夫、经济工程师杰德科娃、技术员泽尔诺夫及其他一些人都自愿来到“煤气设备厂”工作。此外，两厂工会干部还经常交流经验，帮助新厂建立乐队，开展业余文化活动。
    文章最后指出，拖拉机厂1959年提前完成了计划，1960年提出了更大的保证。其中一项新的非同寻常的保证——帮助“煤气设备厂”成为先进工厂，一定会完成。
