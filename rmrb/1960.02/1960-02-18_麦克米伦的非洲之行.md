Macmillan's Trip to Africa
Peng Di
British Prime Minister Macmillan has concluded his visit to Africa and returned to London on the 15th. The protests and demonstrations he encountered everywhere in Africa demonstrate the African people's determination to break the shackles of the colonial system and win the victory of the national independence struggle. No matter what kind of conspiracies and tricks British imperialism uses, it cannot deceive the discerning eyes of the awakened African people.

Wherever Macmillan went on this trip, whether it was from Ibadan in Nigeria to Ndola in Northern Rhodesia, or from Zomba in Nyasaland to Cape Town in South Africa, there were African demonstrations and marches everywhere, shouting slogans such as "Freedom Now," "Give Africa Freedom Immediately," and "Butcher Macmillan Go Home" to "welcome" him. Although the police in some places adopted brutal methods, including large-scale arrests and beatings, which even journalists from British Conservative newspapers disapproved of, they failed to stem the angry tide of the demonstrating masses against colonialism.

The national independence movement sweeping the African continent is violently impacting the imperialist colonial system in Africa with an overwhelming force, causing panic among the heads of the British Empire. As Macmillan's visit drew to a close, he had to admit that the most striking impression he had gained since leaving London a month ago was the strength of African national consciousness. He said helplessly: "Whether we like it or not, this growth of national consciousness is a political fact."

Of course, if it were simply to discover this fact, Macmillan would not have needed to travel 15,000 miles in Africa. The purpose of what he called an "investigative trip" was rather to try to find ways to deal with the new situation in order to continue to maintain British colonial interests.

During his visit to Africa, the British Prime Minister seemed to be careful not to touch the emotions of the Africans in his public speeches, in order to win their sympathy. However, when it came to sharp political issues, the Prime Minister still had to make it clear that he was firmly guided by the principle of protecting the British Empire and the colonial interests of European immigrants in Africa.

The true face of the colonialists cannot be hidden after all. For example, in South Africa, Macmillan hypocritically expressed his opposition to the notorious apartheid policy of the South African government. However, when he came into contact with the boycott movement of South African goods in Britain and elsewhere—a protest action against apartheid—he resolutely opposed the movement. The British Prime Minister was unwilling to touch a hair of this huge transaction, which is closely linked to British business giants; South Africa sells about 90 million pounds of goods to Britain each year, accounting for one-third of South Africa's total exports.

It is quite obvious that Macmillan's pose on the South African apartheid issue is just to win the favor of the African people, especially the South African people. However, the South African people are very clear that Britain has consistently opposed the adoption of resolutions condemning the South African white government's implementation of racial discrimination policies at the United Nations General Assembly. As late as last November, Britain, along with France and Portugal, cast a shameful vote against it. Even just over twenty days before Macmillan arrived in South Africa, he used the excuse that "Britain has no right to interfere in the internal affairs of Commonwealth members" to defend the South African Federation's brutal racial discrimination against Africans.

It must be mentioned that Macmillan's trip to Central Africa. The British Prime Minister there had frequent contact with mining giants and other prominent white figures. After this, the message circulated that the British Prime Minister insisted that Britain would never give up control of the Central African Federation, despite the African people's firm opposition to the rule of a white immigrant population of less than 3% of the total population over the vast majority of Africans, and the widespread African demand for the dissolution of the Central African Federation.

As everyone knows, the Central African Federation was forcibly established by the British government in 1953. The purpose of Britain establishing such a federation was to unite Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland with Southern Rhodesia; in Southern Rhodesia, 200,000 European immigrants have long brutally ruled the two million Africans there according to the same principles of racial discrimination as the South African Federation. The establishment of this federation directly placed 7.3 million Africans under the rule of more than 200,000 whites. In this federation, the vast majority of Africans were deprived of the right to vote. For example, in the last federal election held in November 1958, less than 1,000 African voters were registered.

Not only that, but Africans in the Central African Federation are even more brutally exploited economically by white colonialists. When European immigrants extract huge profits from the copper-producing areas of Northern Rhodesia, from the gold, chromium, and asbestos mines of Southern Rhodesia, and from the large tobacco and tea plantations of Europeans in Nyasaland, African workers and agricultural laborers live a life of scant clothing and food, making it difficult to make ends meet. Official figures for the Federation's national income in 1956 showed that company profits reached 110 million pounds, and the salaries of 200,000 Europeans and a small number of Asian and African employees reached 142.2 million pounds, but the wages, petty brokerage income, and self-sufficiency income of 7 million Africans—the majority of the population—was only 98 million pounds. This last figure shows that 7 million Africans survive on an income of 14 pounds per year, an average of just over one pound (equivalent to seven yuan in Renminbi) per month. But the Federation's electoral system stipulates that Africans must have an annual income of 150 pounds or property of 500 pounds in order to have the right to vote.

This is the situation in various parts of Africa. The African people are eager to change this political, economic, and social injustice, while the British government and white residents insist on preserving it. Macmillan's final words in Central Africa were: the British government sent the Monckton Commission to the Federation to conduct an investigation, not to "destroy the Federation," but to "guide it on how to develop better." Macmillan is not only speaking on behalf of himself or the white residents living in Africa, but behind him are also the monopoly capital based in the British mainland that lives off the colonies, such as the British South Africa Company, Roan Antelope Copper Mines, and other large companies connected to African resources and represented in the cities and Whitehall.

But the current problem is that the African independence movement has developed to such an extent that it cannot be stopped by armed suppression, sweet words, or constitutional debates. Throughout Macmillan's visit to Africa, awakened Africans strongly expressed their desire to completely get rid of colonial rule and achieve independence, to eliminate white rule and racial privileges, to immediately release arrested African leaders, to grant equal voting rights based on the principle of one person, one vote, and to allow Central African countries to withdraw from the Federation, etc. This has been and will continue to be a huge challenge to the British government in the coming months.

    麦克米伦的非洲之行
    彭迪
    英国首相麦克米伦结束了他在非洲的访问，已经在15日回到伦敦。他在非洲各地到处遇到的抗议示威表明，非洲人民决心打破殖民制度的枷锁、争取民族独立斗争的胜利；不论英帝国主义施用什么样的阴谋诡计，都蒙蔽不了觉醒了的非洲人民雪亮的眼睛。
    在麦克米伦这次所到的地方，不论是从尼日利亚的伊巴丹到北罗得西亚的恩多拉，或是从尼亚萨兰的松巴到南非的开普敦，到处都有非洲人示威游行，高呼“现在就要自由”、“马上给非洲自由”、“刽子手麦克滚回去”等口号来“欢迎”他。尽管有些地方的警察采取了包括大规模逮捕、殴打等等连英国保守党报纸的记者也不以为然的野蛮手段，但并没能遏止示威群众反对殖民主义的怒潮。
    席卷非洲大陆的民族独立运动，以排山倒海之势猛烈冲击帝国主义在非洲的殖民体系，使英帝国的首脑感到恐慌。麦克米伦在访问行将结束时不得不承认，自从他一个月前离开伦敦以来，他获得的最触目惊心的印象是非洲民族意识的力量。他无可奈何地说：“不论我们是否喜欢，这种民族意识的增长是一个政治事实。”
    当然，如果单单为了发现这个事实，那麦克米伦无需在非洲从事一万五千英里的旅行。他称之为“调查旅行”的目的不如说是企图找出对付新形势的方式方法，以继续保持英国的殖民利益。
    在非洲访问的过程中，英国首相在公开谈话时似乎小心翼翼地不敢触动非洲人的情绪，为的是骗取他们的同情。可是当谈到尖锐的政治生活问题时，这位首相仍然不得不表明他是坚决的保护英帝国和在非洲的欧洲移民的殖民利益为指导原则的。
    殖民主义者的真面目终究是藏不住的。例如，在南非，麦克米伦虚伪地表示反对臭名远扬的南非政府的种族隔离政策。但是，当他接触到英国和其他地方对南非货物的抵制运动——这是反对种族隔离的抗议行动——时，他就断然反对这个运动。这位英国首相既然不愿触动南非这种庞大交易的一根毫毛，这种交易同英国的企业巨头有着密切的联系；南非每年卖给英国的货物达九千万英镑左右，占南非全部出口的三分之一。
    十分明显，麦克米伦在南非种族隔离问题上所故作的姿态只是想骗取非洲人民、特别是南非人民的好感。然而南非人民非常清楚，英国在联合国大会上一贯反对通过谴责南非白人政府执行种族歧视政策的决议，直到去年11月，英国还和法国、葡萄牙一起投了可耻的反对票。甚至就在麦克米伦到达南非前的二十几天，他还借口“英国没有权利干涉英联邦成员国内政”，来维护南非联邦的殖民者对非洲人的残酷的种族歧视。
    必须提到的是麦克米伦的中非之行。这位英国首相在那里同矿业巨头和其他的白种著名人士进行了频繁的接触。在这以后流传着这样的消息：英国首相坚持英国决不放弃对中非联邦的控制，尽管非洲人民坚决反对占总人口不到3％的白种移民对绝大多数非洲人的统治，广大的非洲人要求解散中非联邦。
    大家知道，中非联邦是英国政府在1953年强行建立起来的。英国建立这样一个联邦的目的是把北罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰这两个国家同南罗得西亚联合起来；在南罗得西亚，二十万名欧洲移民长期以来以与南非联邦种族歧视同样的原则对那里的两百万非洲人进行了残酷的统治。这个联邦的成立把七百三十万非洲人直接置于二十多万白种人的统治之下。在这个联邦里，绝大多数的非洲人被剥夺了选举权利，如在1958年11月举行的上次联邦选举中，登记的非洲人选民还不到一千名。
    不仅如此，中非联邦的非洲人在经济上更受到白人殖民者的残酷剥削。当欧洲移民从北罗得西亚的产铜地区，从南罗得西亚的金矿、铬矿和石绵矿中，从尼亚萨兰的欧洲人的大烟草种植园和茶叶种植园中攫取巨大利润的时候，非洲工人和农业劳动者却过着少衣缺食、难以度日的生活。1956年联邦国民收入的官方数字表明，公司的利润达一亿一千万英镑，二十万欧洲人和少数亚非籍职员的薪水达一亿四千二百万英镑，但是，七百万非洲人——占人口的大多数——的工资，小本经纪的收入，自产自给的收入只有九千八百万英镑。最后的这个数字表明，七百万非洲人靠每年十四英镑的收入维持生活，平均每月只有一镑多一点的生活费（相等于人民币七元）。但是联邦的选举制度规定，非洲人要有一百五十英镑的年收入或五百英镑的房产，才能有选举权。
    这便是非洲各地的情况。非洲人民渴望改变这种政治、经济和社会的不公平，而英国政府和白种居民却坚持要保留它。麦克米伦在中非的时候最后讲的话是：英国政府派蒙克顿委员会到联邦去进行调查，不是为了“破坏联邦”，而是在“指导它如何才能更好地发展”。麦克米伦不但是代表他本人或者住在非洲白种居民讲话，在他背后的还有中心设在英国本土的靠殖民地为生的垄断资本，例如：英国南非公司、罗昂安蒂洛普铜矿和其它同非洲资源有联系并且在城市和白厅有代表的大公司。
    但是，目前的问题是，非洲的独立运动已经发展到了这样的地步，无论是武装镇压、甜言蜜语、或是宪法争论，都不能够加以阻挡。在麦克米伦访问非洲的整个过程中，觉醒中的非洲人强烈表示要求完全摆脱殖民统治而独立，要求消灭白人统治和种族特权，要求立即释放被捕的非洲领袖，要求按每人一票的原则给予平等的选举权、要求让中非国家退出联邦等等。这过去一直是、今后几个月内仍然是对英国政府的巨大挑战。
