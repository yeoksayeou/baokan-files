    The Warm Home of Returned Overseas Chinese
    Zhang Fen, Secretary of the CPC State-Owned Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm Committee
    With the east wind blowing and the rising sun shining, our Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm in Hainan Island is once again welcoming a spring of continuous leaps forward.
    In the early morning, the Xinglong Mountain, shrouded in dense fog, is filled with the sound of axes and the rumble of blasting. As the morning mist dissipates, the green mountains are revealed, along with countless red flags. People are working hard to reclaim land. The silent hills are buzzing with activity!
    The wind blows from the sea, across the green, wavy coffee plantations, across the fragrant lemongrass slopes, across the lush green rice paddies, bringing a refreshing fragrance... On the banks of the Sun River, shaded by lush greenery and with waters as smooth as a mirror, the Hakka mountain songs float in the air:
    There's much joy at Sun River's shore,
    So much joy we love to sing,
    Singing one song after another,
    From sunrise till the sun goes down.
    Building an Overseas Chinese hometown by the South Sea,
    Coffee beans red, lemongrass fragrant,
    Thatch huts turn to brick houses,
    Xinglong changes, oh, how it changes! ...
    How beautiful and prosperous our Xinglong is!
    Xinglong, located on the coast of the South China Sea, where the three counties of Yaxian, Qiongzhong, and Wanning in Hainan Island meet, is backed by mountains and faces the sea, with spring all year round, abundant rainfall, and rich resources. It not only has great potential for developing tropical crops, but also is an ideal place for engaging in diversified operations. However, such a uniquely endowed area was full of scars and desolation before liberation, regarded by the Hainanese as a terrible place "where you might go but never return." In October 1951, the State-Owned Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm was established here, and after vigorous reclamation, this place haunted by pythons and wild beasts was greatly transformed.
    Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm is one of the larger overseas Chinese farms in our country. Of the farm's more than 6,700 workers and family members, returned overseas Chinese account for 98%. Which family or household among these people who used to be scattered overseas does not have a heartbreaking story of blood and tears! The four old miners now living in the nursing home once told me about their painful experiences. They were sold as "piglets" to the slave owners of the early 20th century – the Dutch colonialists – between 1906 and 1909. They toiled in the mines of Bangka Island in Indonesia for more than fifty years, enduring all kinds of bullying and abuse, and only recently returned to their motherland. The youngest of them is already seventy-three years old. Now they are happily spending their remaining years in the nursing home.
    Those who have tasted suffering can better appreciate the value of happiness. Overseas orphans now have a strong motherland and a happy home. How can they not work harder! In the past eight years, the workers of Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm, with their soaring enthusiasm, have conquered nature and reclaimed more than 70,000 mu of virgin land. On this land, they have planted 162 kinds of crops, including the well-known oil palm, lemongrass, pepper, and sisal, as well as beverage crops such as coffee, cocoa, and tea; medicinal crops such as snakewood and patchouli; and fruit crops such as durian, rambutan, and breadfruit.
    With the development of production, Xinglong's appearance has changed. Under Niuguling, chimneys stand tall, and factories stand in rows. More than 20 factory workshops undertake the important tasks of processing agricultural products, manufacturing and repairing tools and farm implements, producing chemical fertilizers, and construction materials for the entire farm. More than 300 kilometers of yellow earth and gravel roads crisscross the area. On the blue sea, motorboats and sailboats of nearly 100 tons come and go. The workers' long-standing desire to turn water damage into water conservancy is about to be realized: the comprehensive management project of the Sun River, invested by the state, has entered a stage of intense construction. People are going to cut off the Sun River and build a hydroelectric power station on the reservoir, allowing small electric boats to travel unhindered on the 80-kilometer-long riverbed, and developing poultry and freshwater aquaculture in an artificial lake of about 20 square li...
    In the past eight years, the state has built more than 33,800 square meters of various types of housing for the farm workers. More than 1,970 children of returned overseas Chinese are receiving education in farm-run primary and secondary schools, and about 1,000 children under the age of six are growing up in kindergartens and nurseries. Fifty-six single elderly people are spending their twilight years happily in the nursing home. More than 3,500 returned overseas Chinese with labor capabilities are working in industry, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fishing, transportation and other departments, truly with everyone in their proper place. The average annual wage of workers has also increased from 120 yuan in 1952 to more than 470 yuan in 1959. People are living a busy and happy life!
    The drums of the Great Leap Forward are beating louder, and the steps of the people of Xinglong are widening. In the first month or so of this year's spring, people have already opened more than 23,000 mu of uncultivated land, which is more than one-third of the total area planned for reclamation throughout the year. On the undulating mountains, there are layers of terraces surrounding the mountains; the large and red coffee beans have not yet been picked, and new coffee trees have bloomed with white and fragrant flowers... This year will be another year of harvest!
    As we continue to wage war against nature, good news comes on the east wind. We know that many compatriots residing in Indonesia are about to return to the motherland. We are filled with joy, and we open our arms: Dear brothers and sisters, welcome! Come and join us in building a beautiful motherland and a happy home! (Attached pictures)

    归侨的温暖家园
    中共国营兴隆华侨农场委员会书记　张奋
    东风吹拂、旭日普照，我们海南岛兴隆华侨农场，又迎来了连续跃进的春天。
    清晨，埋藏在浓雾中的兴隆山，不时传出铮铮的斧头声和隆隆的爆破声。晨雾消散了，露出了满山青绿，露出了无数红旗。开荒的人正在挥汗劳动着。寂静的山岗沸腾了！
    风从海上吹来，吹过泛着绿色波涛的咖啡园，吹过长满香茅草的香茅坡，吹过碧油油的稻田，送来一阵阵清香……浓荫蔽岸、波光如镜的太阳河畔，飘荡着客家山歌：
    太阳河畔欢乐多，
    欢乐多来爱唱歌，
    唱了一首又一首，
    日出唱到日头落。
    南海边上建侨乡，
    咖啡豆红香茅香，
    茅屋变成砖瓦房，
    兴隆变呀变了样！…………
    我们的兴隆是多么美好，又是多么富裕的地方啊！
    兴隆，位于祖国南海之滨，是海南岛的崖县、琼中、万宁三县接壤之处，背山面海，四季常春，雨量充沛，资源丰富，不仅发展热带作物有很大潜力，并且是大搞多种经营的理想的地方；可是，这样一个得天独厚的地区，解放前却疮痍满目，遍地荒凉，被海南人视为
  “有命去无命回”的可怕地方。1951年10月，这里创办了国营兴隆华侨农场，经过大力开垦，这大蟒、野兽出没的地方，才大大改变了模样。
    兴隆华侨农场是目前我国华侨农场中规模较大的一个。全场六千七百多职工和家属中，归国华侨占了98％。这些过去流落在海外的人们，哪一家、哪一户没有一本令人心酸的血泪史！现在住在敬老院里的四名老矿工，曾经对我诉说过他们惨痛的经历。他们是在1906年、1909年间，先后被人当作“猪仔”转卖给二十世纪初叶的奴隶主——荷兰殖民者的。他们在印度尼西亚汶岛的矿山做了五十多年苦工，受尽了欺凌蹂躏，最近才回到祖国。其中年龄最小的一个，也已经七十三岁了。现在他们已在敬老院中欢乐地度着他们的晚年。
    尝过苦痛的人愈加能体会到幸福的可贵。海外孤儿如今有了强大的祖国，有了幸福的家园，他们怎能不加倍努力地工作呢！八年来，兴隆华侨农场的职工，用他们冲天的干劲，战胜了大自然，开垦了七万多亩处女地。在这上面，种植了一百六十二种作物，其中除人们所熟知的油棕、香茅、胡椒、剑麻等外，还有饮料作物如咖啡、可可和茶等；药用作物如蛇木、广藿香等；果树作物如榴槤、红毛丹、面包果等。
    随着生产的发展，兴隆的面貌改变了。牛牯岭下，烟囱高耸，工厂林立，二十多座工厂车间，担负全场农产品加工、制造和修理工具、农具、生产化学肥料和基建用材的重任。三百多公里的黄土、砂石铺成的公路，纵横交错。蓝蓝的海面上，近百吨的机轮渔帆来往遨游着。职工们多年来变水害为水利的愿望即将实现：由国家投资的太阳河综合治理工程，已进入紧张的施工阶段。人们要腰斩太阳河，在水库上建立水电站，让小电船在八十多公里的河床畅通无阻，让方圆约二十华里的人工大湖发展家禽和淡水养殖业……。
    八年多来，国家为农场职工建筑了各式住宅三万三千八百多平方米。一千九百七十多名归侨子弟在场办中、小学校受教育，约一千名六周岁以下的幼儿分别在幼儿园、托儿所中成长；五十六位单身老人在敬老院里欢度晚年；三千五百多个有劳动力的归侨，分别在工、农、林、牧、副、渔、交通运输等部门工作，真是人人各得其所。职工每年平均工资，也从1952年的一百二十元增长到1959年的四百七十多元。人们过着紧张而又愉快的生活！
    大跃进的战鼓擂得更响，兴隆的人们的脚步跨得更宽。今年开春的头一个多月，人们已开了生荒地二万三千多亩，等于全年计划开荒总面积的三分之一还多。起伏蜿蜒的山峦上，出现了一叠叠环山梯田；又大又红的咖啡豆还未摘完，新的咖啡树又开出了又白又香的花……今年，将又是一个丰收年！
    在我们继续向大自然开战的日子里，东风传来喜讯，我们知道有许多侨居印度尼西亚的同胞即将回到祖国来。我们满心喜悦，我们张开双臂：亲爱的兄弟姊妹们，欢迎你们！来吧，来和我们一道建设美好的祖国，建设幸福的家园！（附图片）
