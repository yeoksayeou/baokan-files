Sow One Grain of Good Seed in Spring, Harvest Ten Thousand Grains of Good Grain in Autumn
　　Xia浦 County Prepares Sufficient Good Seeds for Spring Planting, Striving to Achieve Crop Improvement This Year

　　(Reported by this newspaper) Xia浦 County, Fujian Province, recently launched a mass movement to promote good seeds and has taken various concrete measures to prepare sufficient good seeds for spring planting.
　　Over the past few years, the Xia浦 County Committee has deeply realized from its practice of leading production that selecting good seeds is a production-increasing measure that requires little investment and yields great results. In 1953, the county's sown area of good seeds accounted for only 12% of the total sown area. Last year, it expanded to 97%. This year, they are striving to achieve the improvement of various crops with good seeds. Based on the results of last year's evaluation and identification, the County Committee decided that this year, early rice should popularize good varieties such as Lu Cai No., Nan Te No., Korean Early, and San Dong Early. Late rice should popularize good varieties such as Jiu Dang Early, Wu Ke Jian, Late Indica No. 9, Xia Jing No. 1, and sticky rice. Cash crops such as peanuts and soybeans should also fully popularize good varieties to further increase yields. All late-maturing, low-yielding, and inferior varieties of various crops in the county must be resolutely eliminated to ensure that this year becomes a county without inferior varieties.
　　In order to achieve the above requirements, Party committees at all levels have strengthened leadership over seed work and established seed work leading organizations at each level. The county established a Seed Committee, headed by the County Party Secretary; each commune and brigade also established Seed Committees and groups. The county, communes, and brigades universally consolidated and expanded the original good seed propagation bases and actively developed new bases, designating special land for good seed propagation experiments. At present, the county has one county-run good seed propagation farm, eleven commune-run farms, and one hundred and four brigade-run farms, forming a three-level good seed propagation system at the county, commune, and brigade levels. In order to promote mass-based selection and breeding of good seeds, the County Committee has also stipulated reward measures for mass breeding of good seeds. Those who can create new rice varieties with more than 500 grains per ear will be rewarded.
　　Currently, the spring planting season is approaching. In order to prepare sufficient good seeds for spring planting, the County Committee organized seed work cadres and commune and brigade seed management personnel to conduct inspections of the types, varieties, and storage amounts of various crop good seeds stored last year, team by team and warehouse by warehouse. Based on the principle of self-reliance as the mainstay and external assistance as a supplement, they organized communes and brigades to adjust and exchange surplus and shortage of good seeds. The county has already adjusted and exchanged 1,059 dan of early rice good seeds and 2,400 dan of late rice good seeds. The good seeds still lacking in the county have also been dispatched to brother counties before the new year to contact for allocation, and more than 1,000 dan of early rice good seeds and more than 2,000 tons of No. 134 Taiwan Sugar good sugarcane seedlings have been transferred back. Due to early attention, quick action, and thorough preparation, the county currently has an average of 18.5 jin of early rice good seeds per mu, an average of 16.2 liang of medium and late rice good seeds per mu, and sufficient sweet potato seedlings and peanut good seeds have also been prepared.
　　At present, each commune has universally formulated specific plans for this year's seed work and has made comprehensive arrangements for the promotion of various rice good seeds in accordance with local conditions. For example, Yantian Commune recently convened a meeting of agricultural technicians, experienced farmers, and relevant personnel, and in accordance with the climatic conditions and soil types of three different regions, coastal, semi-mountainous, and mountainous areas, and with reference to the characteristics of the varieties, made specific plans for the promotion of good seeds this year.

    春播一粒良种秋收万粒好粮
    霞浦县备足春播良种，今年争取实现作物良种化
    本报讯　福建霞浦县最近开展了推广良种的群众运动，并采取各项具体措施，备足了春播良种。
    几年来，霞浦县委从领导生产的实践中，深刻体会到选用良种是花本少、收效大的增产措施。1953年全县良种播种面积只占播种总面积的12％，去年扩大到97％，今年争取实现各种作物良种化。县委根据去年评选和鉴定的结果，决定今年早稻要普及陆财号、南特号、朝鲜早、三冬早等良种，晚稻要普及九当早、乌壳尖、晚籼九号、霞粳一号、?糯等良种，花生、大豆等经济作物也要全面普及良种，进一步提高产量。全县各种作物迟熟的低产的劣种都要坚决淘汰，保证今年成为无劣种县。
    为了实现上述要求，各级党委加强对种子工作的领导，层层建立种子工作领导机构。县成立种子委员会，由县委书记挂帅；各公社、大队也都分别成立了种子委员会和小组。县、社、队普遍整顿扩大原有的良种繁殖基地，积极发展新基地，划出专门土地进行良种繁殖试验。目前全县已有县办良种繁殖场一个，社办场十一个，队办场一百零四个，形成了县、社、队三级良种繁殖系统。为了促进群众性的选育良种工作，县委对群众选育良种还规定了奖励办法，凡能创造每穗五百粒以上的水稻新品种者，都给予奖励。
    目前春播季节越来越近，为了备足春播良种，县委组织了种子工作干部和社队种子管理人员，对去年储备的各种作物良种，逐队逐仓进行了种类、品种和储藏量的检查。在自力更生为主、外援为辅的原则下，组织社队之间进行良种余缺调剂串换。全县已调剂串换早稻良种一千零五十九担，晚稻良种二千四百担；本县尚缺的良种，也于年前先后派出干部到兄弟县联系调拨，现已调回早稻良种一千多担，另有台糖134良种蔗苗二千多吨。由于抓得早，动手快，准备充分，目前全县早稻良种平均每亩有十八斤半，中晚稻良种平均每亩有十六斤二两，番薯苗、花生良种也已备足。
    目前，各公社已普遍制订出今年种子工作的具体规划，并对各种水稻良种的推广，因地制宜地作了全面安排。如盐田公社最近召开了农业技术干部、老农和有关人员会议，按照沿海、半山区、山区等三种不同地区的气候条件和土壤类型，参照品种的特性，作出了今年推广良种的具体计划。
