Let's All Contribute Ideas and Suggestions to Improve the Jiefang Truck

Our factory has been producing Jiefang trucks for several years, and they have played a role in transportation across the country. However, the Jiefang truck is not a perfect vehicle and still has some shortcomings that need to be improved.

We thank the people of the whole country for their past concern for the Jiefang truck, and for regularly reflecting the usage situation and providing suggestions for improvement, which have helped our improvement work achieve considerable results. Encouraged by the Great Leap Forward, we are determined to improve existing products faster, better, and more economically, so that they can better serve transportation work. We hope everyone will give us more support.

When considering the comprehensive improvement of the Jiefang truck, we hope everyone will pay attention to the following aspects:

	I. According to the instructions of higher authorities, this improved vehicle will still be a medium-load general-purpose four-wheel truck;

	II. The improvement should be combined with the original production conditions as much as possible, in order to make full use of existing equipment and reduce production preparation work;

	III. Simplify the structure, technology and unnecessary devices as much as possible to increase output;

	IV. Save the consumption of production materials as much as possible, and try to reduce and minimize excessively heavy and large parts;

	V. Save fuel and tire consumption materials to reduce transportation costs;

	VI. Simplify or reduce repair work to reduce maintenance costs;

	VII. Strive for convenient maintenance to improve vehicle utilization;

	VIII. Strive to better meet various usage requirements to fully exploit the potential of the car;

	IX. Improve driving conditions and reduce the fatigue of the drivers;

	X. Consider unified development with variant vehicles (such as dump trucks, tractor-trailers, off-road vehicles, etc.).

We hope that you will notify us of various improvement opinions, improvement plans, improvement measures, advanced experiences, and other advantages or disadvantages of other vehicles that are worth our reference, in the form of letters, drawings or samples.

We plan to invite relevant personnel from inside and outside the factory in early March to jointly study your opinions.

    大家来出主意献计策让解放牌汽车更完善
    我厂生产解放牌载重汽车已经好几年了，它们对各地运输事业起了一定的作用。但是，解放牌汽车还不是一种十全十美的汽车，还有些缺点需要改进。
    我们感谢全国人民过去对解放牌汽车的关心，经常向我们反映使用情况，提改进建议，帮助我们的改进工作取得了不少成绩。在大跃进的鼓舞下，我们决心多快好省地改进现有产品，使它更好的为运输工作服务。希望大家多多给予支持。
    在考虑解放牌汽车全面改进的时候，希望大家注意以下几方面：
    一、根据上级指示，这种汽车改进后仍将是中等载重量通用性四轮汽车；
    二、改进时将尽可能地同原来的生产条件相结合，以便充分利用现有设备，减少生产准备工作；
    三、尽可能简化结构和工艺以及不必要的装置，以提高产量；
    四、尽可能节约生产材料的消耗，尽量减轻和减小过重过大的零件；
    五、节约燃料和轮胎等消耗材料，以降低运输成本；
    六、简化或减少修理工作，以降低维修费用；
    七、力求维护方便，以提高车辆利用率；
    八、力求更好地满足各种使用要求，以充分发挥汽车的潜力；
    九、改进驾驶条件，减少司机同志的疲劳；
    十、结合变型车（如翻斗车、牵引车、越野车等）统一考虑。
    希望把您和您单位有关的各种改进意见、改进方案、改进措施、先进经验，以及其他车子的某些优点或缺点值得我们参考的地方，用信件、图纸或样品等通知我们。
    我们准备在3月初请厂内外有关人员共同研究您们的意见。
