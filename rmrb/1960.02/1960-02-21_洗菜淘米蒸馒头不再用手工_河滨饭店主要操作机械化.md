Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, February 20th: The Riverside Restaurant in Guiyang City has successfully trial-produced ten types of machinery, including a meat grinder, rice washing machine, electric steamed bun machine, and steam noodle cooker, transforming the main operations from manual to mechanized, increasing work efficiency by more than half.

In January of this year, the restaurant's Party branch, following the instructions of the Guiyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, mobilized employees to vigorously engage in technological innovation, transforming manual operations into mechanized and semi-mechanized operations. Chef Chen Peifa and receptionist Bai Yukun, among others, worked hard for two days to create a lightweight meat grinder. Subsequently, vegetable cutting machines, rice washing machines, and meat cutting machines were successively produced, achieving mechanization of the entire restaurant's main operations within six days. The rice washing machine and vegetable washing machine quickly washed the rice and vegetables clean, while the meat cutting machine, meat grinder, and vegetable cutting machine cut the meat and vegetables into various slices, shreds, and dices. Steaming rice and vegetables was steam-powered; just by opening the tap, dozens of bowls of noodles could be cooked in one minute; making steamed buns, from dough mixing to completion, was entirely done by machines in continuous operation; a food delivery machine was also used to deliver food to the tables; the dishwashing machine can wash 10,000 bowls per hour.
