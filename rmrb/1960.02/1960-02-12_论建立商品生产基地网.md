On Establishing a Commodity Production Base Network
Yang Yichen, Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

The establishment of a base network is an inevitable trend in the development of commodity production.

Establishing commodity production bases and using large-scale production methods to increase commodity production in large quantities and in a concentrated manner is an objective requirement for the rapid development of production and the continuous improvement of people's living standards. It is determined by the development of the situation.

Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and with the strong support of the people of the whole country, Heilongjiang Province, through the key construction projects during the First Five-Year Plan period and the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958-1959, has been transformed from a "Great Northern Wilderness" with an extremely weak industrial base, poverty and backwardness into a new and important industrial base of the country centered on heavy industry and based on modern large-scale enterprises. The proportion of industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value has reached about 75%. Due to the very rapid development of industrial production, the population of urban industrial and mining areas and forest areas has increased rapidly, more than doubling in 1959 compared with 1952. Women have also come out to participate in production, there are no idlers in the cities, everywhere are "double-income families," and purchasing power has increased rapidly. Therefore, the demand for non-staple foods and daily-use industrial products is increasing in quantity, variety, and quality.

Historically, the non-staple foods needed by cities were supplied by rural areas. Because the urban population is now increasing rapidly and the rural population is relatively decreasing, the ratio of urban and rural population is changing rapidly. In 1952, Heilongjiang Province had three and a half rural people supplying the needs of one urban person, but now it has become one and a half rural people supplying the needs of one urban person. Moreover, the agricultural and sideline products of Heilongjiang Province, in addition to meeting the needs of cities in the province, also undertake the task of supporting the whole country. This is one aspect. On the other hand, with the development of agricultural production and the rapid increase of farmers' income, the living standards of the rural areas have been significantly improved. The broad masses of farmers are no longer simply satisfied with the consumption of grain. On the basis of meeting the grain supply, the main trend of improving people's lives is to develop towards non-staple foods and daily-use industrial products. Therefore, although the production of non-staple foods in Heilongjiang Province has developed greatly in recent years, the commodity rate of some varieties has not increased fast enough, and it is not possible to quickly produce more commodities to meet the growing consumption needs of the cities.

After the collectivization of agricultural production was realized, grain production developed rapidly, but the production of vegetables, pigs, poultry, eggs, and other non-staple foods still belonged more to decentralized, family, and individual production, mainly relying on garden plots and feed plots to grow vegetables, grow feed, raise pigs, and raise poultry. This kind of production is basically self-sufficient production, with a small amount of commodities and a low commodity rate. Therefore, compared with the diversified operations in agriculture and the rapidly developing grain production, it is still a "short leg." Under this situation, it is difficult to rely entirely on rural production to supply the ever-increasing needs of urban non-staple foods.

With the rapid development of production, social purchasing power has risen rapidly, and the living needs of urban and rural people have become increasingly rich and colorful. They not only need a large amount of non-staple foods, but also require the supply of more, more complete, higher quality, and cheaper daily-use industrial products. However, the industry in Heilongjiang Province is mainly heavy industry, and the foundation of light industry is relatively weak. Relatively speaking, light industry is also a "short leg." For a long time, many daily-use industrial products have relied on the support of brother provinces and cities. This urgently requires the rapid development of light and chemical industries. However, most of the raw materials needed for the development of light and chemical industries come from rural areas. This requires rural areas to continue to increase grain production and, at the same time, organize professional teams to vigorously develop the production of raw materials for light and chemical industries.

Heilongjiang Province has a vast territory, fertile soil, crisscrossing rivers, dense mountains and forests, and endless grasslands. These are extremely favorable resource conditions for developing commodity production. Especially with the establishment, consolidation, and sound development of the people's communes, broad prospects have been opened up for unified planning of production, comprehensive utilization of resources, rational organization of manpower, materials, and financial resources, establishment of commodity production bases, and development of state-owned and collective large-scale production. Therefore, the province's commodity base network has rapidly developed on the basis of the original state-owned farms, ranches, and non-staple food bases.

The "Three-Combination" Policy for Establishing Commodity Production Bases

The development process of establishing commodity production bases in Heilongjiang Province is: from state-run farms and ranches, to commercial service departments developing bases, and then to people's communes developing bases; from focusing on commodity grain bases to developing commodity bases for non-staple foods and diversified operations in large quantities, and then to developing industrial raw material bases. Initially, a number of grain farms and livestock farms were established with state investment. Over the past ten years, they have provided the state with a large amount of commodity grain and livestock products. This is the old foundation for state-run bases. After the advanced cooperatives in 1956, due to the rapid development of production and the great increase in purchasing power, the demand for non-staple foods increased rapidly. Therefore, the production of some non-staple foods seemed to lag behind the needs. In order to solve this problem, on the one hand, we grasped the mass production of vegetables, pigs, poultry, and fish; on the other hand, the agricultural sector and the commercial service sector closely cooperated and began to establish some non-staple food production bases. In addition to establishing thirteen vegetable bases, a number of pig, poultry, and fish farms were also established. Because of grasping the production of vegetables, pigs, and other non-staple foods, the supply of non-staple foods has been significantly changed. It proves that the financial and trade departments, starting from production and cooperating with relevant departments to establish commodity production bases, can not only greatly increase the amount of commodities, but also better drive the mass production of non-staple foods. In 1957, we summarized the experience of commercial service departments in trial-running non-staple food production bases, and included it in the financial and trade conference of the Provincial Party Committee as one of the methods for financial and trade work to serve production and promote production development. It was proposed that for the production of non-staple foods and local and special products with large commodity properties, the agricultural and commercial departments should closely cooperate to establish commodity production bases. In mountainous areas and remote areas with inconvenient transportation, commercial departments should establish necessary processing or semi-processing enterprises to achieve local production, local procurement, and local processing. In this way, with the Great Leap Forward in 1958, commodity production bases have developed greatly. The number of pig and poultry bases run by the commercial sector alone increased from 38 in 1956 to 132 in 1958. The total output value increased twenty times, pigs increased ninety-two times, and poultry increased eight times. This has played a great role in further expanding commodity production and ensuring market supply. Yarsai Farm in the suburbs of Qiqihar City is one of the more prominent ones. This farm, which mainly produces non-staple foods, was established at the end of 1957 by a combination of cadres transferred from the commercial system and two advanced agricultural production cooperatives. By the end of 1958, they had also absorbed eighteen management areas (production brigades) of the people's commune. Because they planted a lot of vegetables and raised a lot of pigs, cattle, sheep, poultry, and fish, they played the role of a "living warehouse" in the supply of non-staple foods. When there was a shortage of vegetables in the market, the farm's vegetables were put on the market in large quantities; when there were too many vegetables in the market, the farm's vegetables were stored. This not only ensured the supply of the market, but also maintained the stability of vegetable prices. Because they engaged in diversified operations, in the year since the establishment of the farm, they not only supplied a large amount of vegetables and other non-staple foods to the market, but also increased their income by more than 300,000 yuan. The experience of Yarsai Farm pointed out the direction for the state to establish commodity production bases, and promoted the province's farms and ranches to develop from relatively simple operation of grain or animal husbandry to diversified operations with grain or animal husbandry as the main business, and then promoted the high tide of self-sufficient production of non-staple foods by institutions, enterprises, troops, and schools.

In 1959, with the consolidation and development of the people's communes, not only did the state-owned commodity production bases in Heilongjiang Province develop greatly, but also the people's communes, according to the principle of giving equal importance to self-sufficient production and commodity production, also established commodity production bases. Weihe People's Commune in Shangzhi County is a good example. In the spring of 1959, they designated several production teams with barren land but extremely rich pastoral, sideline, and fishery resources to establish eight commodity production base farms for animal husbandry, fisheries, beekeeping, sericulture, vegetables, and fruits. These eight base farms are all based on one or two varieties and implement comprehensive management. With the establishment of the bases, things that could not be done in the past were done, things that developed slowly became faster, and the amount of commodities was expanded. They developed sericulture and fish farming from scratch. Originally, their vegetables could not be self-sufficient. By 1959, they not only achieved self-sufficiency, but also produced more than 2 million jin of commodity vegetables, and developed greenhouse production to achieve year-round greenery. Pigs and sheep increased by more than one time, cattle increased by 50%, and bees increased from more than 1,000 boxes to more than 4,000 boxes. Although these base farms were newly established, they produced more than 600,000 yuan of commodities in the same year of establishment, with a commodity rate of 77%, and increased the accumulation of the commune by more than 170,000 yuan, accounting for 40% of the total accumulation of the commune. The experience of Weihe People's Commune in establishing commodity production bases pointed out the direction for the commune to establish commodity production bases and promoted the high tide of people's communes throughout the province in running commodity production bases in a big way.

In the first half of 1959, the Provincial Party Committee summarized the experience of Yarsai Farm and Weihe People's Commune in running commodity production bases, and the experience of institutions and enterprises in carrying out self-sufficient production, and affirmed that the state's establishment of commodity production bases is the backbone force for developing commodity production, the people's communes' establishment of commodity production bases is the basic force for developing commodity production, and the self-sufficient production of institutions and enterprises is also an important aspect of developing non-staple food production. The Provincial Party Committee proposed that developing and establishing commodity production bases is a strategic task to realize the great development of commodity production. While engaging in commodity production bases in a big way, mass production should be universally developed, every household should raise pigs and poultry, and fully tap the potential to make the best use of people's talents. This is also an important source for expanding commodity production and increasing the amount of commodities. According to the Party's complete set of "walking on two legs" policy, the "three-combination" policy of "the state and the commune running bases, institutions and enterprises engaging in self-sufficiency, and universally developing mass production" was put forward. In July 1959, the Rural Financial and Trade Work Symposium held by the Central Financial and Trade Department in Heilongjiang Province affirmed this practice. In August, the Provincial Party Committee convened a provincial commodity production base conference in Jingbo Lake, formulated the development plan for commodity production bases, as well as policies and measures. Party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership over this work, and commodity production bases throughout the province have achieved universal and rapid development. Not only are there numerous grain and sideline product production bases, but also, in accordance with the needs of developing light and chemical industries, a number of production bases for pine resin, alkali soil, silkworm cocoons, fur, tobacco, hemp, and iron sulfide have been established. A network of commodity production bases dotted across the province has begun to take shape. At the same time, according to the principle of public raising as the main focus, with both public and private raising, public and private raising and private and private raising methods were adopted for the problem of rural commune members' families raising livestock and poultry. Therefore, mass sideline production has also developed.

The Great Superiority Shown by Commodity Production Bases

The development of commodity production bases has not been smooth sailing. In the early stage of establishing the bases, some people believed that "establishing commodity production bases would compete with grain for land and labor, affecting grain production"; some people believed that "commercial departments engaging in bases is not doing their job properly and will affect purchasing and sales business"; and some people especially advocated "letting commune members' families engage in sideline production in a big way in order to mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members." This is not only a struggle between the two methods of "less, slower, worse, and more expensive" and "more, faster, better, and more economical", but also contains a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. We timely criticized and overcame these erroneous ideas and arguments, and pointed out that as long as we act in accordance with the principle of overall planning and comprehensive arrangements, it will not only not affect grain production, but will instead promote each other, so that people can make the best of their talents, land can make the best of its strength, and things can make the best of their use. We believe that only by actively supporting and promoting the development of commodity production bases can the financial and trade departments provide a solid material foundation for market supply. Under the condition of not hindering collective production, using the non-official labor time and old and weak labor force of commune members to develop commune members' family sideline businesses is also an aspect that cannot be ignored. At the same time, it was pointed out that the establishment and development of commodity production bases is determined by the development of the situation and cannot be shaken. Facts have proved that once commodity production bases are established, they show their great role.

(1) The amount of commodities has greatly increased, ensuring market supply and stabilizing market prices. In 1959, the commodity rate of wheat and soybeans in state-owned farms throughout the province reached more than 80%; the commodity rate of fat pigs reached about 70%. The commodity rate of Yarsai Farm, a state-owned commodity production base, reached more than 70%, and the commodity rate of the commodity production base of Weihe People's Commune reached 77%. The amount of commodities provided by state-owned commodity production bases alone accounted for the total procurement volume of the province: fat pigs 11%, poultry 33.5%, and fish 25%. This is only the initial stage, and it has played a great role. With the greater development of the bases, the proportion of commodities will become larger and larger. The advantage of commodity production bases is that they can be used and taken whenever they are needed, and more or less can be used and taken. It is a living warehouse for supplying the market. City and county bases have also played a huge role. Baiquan County, as a pig production base, provides one commodity pig for every three and a half agricultural people, while the province averages only one commodity pig for every ten agricultural people. Products such as pine resin, sulfuric acid, and silkworm cocoons, which could not be produced in the province in the past and relied entirely on foreign aid, have also begun to be produced in large quantities, creating conditions for the development of light and chemical industries.

(2) It can continuously develop the commune economy of the people's communes and the ownership by the whole people. In the continuous development and growth of state-owned commodity bases, a part of the people's communes or management areas are absorbed, so that the proportion of ownership by the whole people is constantly growing. At the same time, the development of commodity production bases run by the people's communes will continuously develop economic undertakings at the commune level, increase the income at the commune level, and the commodity production bases of the communes are mostly established in poor areas, which is more conducive to helping poor areas catch up with rich areas and creating conditions for the gradual transition to commune ownership in the future.

(3) Accelerate technological transformation, drive agricultural technology revolution, and promote the development of agricultural modernization and commune industrialization. Heilongjiang Province's state-owned large-scale farms and ranches have basically realized mechanization; the speed of mechanization of commodity production bases is also very fast. The newly established Yarsai Farm has implemented water irrigation in one-third of the farmland and mechanized farming in one-fifth of the area in just two years. The power of industry has been fully electrified, and non-field operation mechanization has reached about one-third. Similarly, the mechanization of commodity production bases of people's communes is also faster. This is because the expansion of commodity production by the bases has rapidly increased capital, which will inevitably create favorable conditions for accelerating the realization of agricultural modernization and commune industrialization.

(4) Create high-yield records and better drive mass production. Many bases have created records of high-speed development of production. Thirteen base counties have created the experience of large-scale high-yield pig production. The Youth Livestock Farm in Yuquan Town, Acheng County, created a record of one sow producing 100 piglets in three litters a year. Many bases have boldly reformed breeding methods and plant cultivation methods. It has played a great role in promoting the production of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery in the entire rural area.

Stride Forward to Production Base and Base Modernization

Since the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee put forward the "three-combination" policy of "the state and the commune running bases, institutions and enterprises engaging in self-sufficiency, and universally developing mass production", a high tide of large-scale, magnificent, and nationwide commodity production bases has been formed everywhere, and a strong commodity production base network has begun to be established. The province already has 75 large-scale state-owned farms and ranches, combined with more than 150 small and medium-sized farms and ranches in cities and counties, forming a strong state-owned farm and ranch group. The commercial service department has established 215 non-staple food production bases, including 11 large-scale provincial aquaculture farms, 14 livestock farms centered on pig raising, and many wildlife breeding farms, sericulture farms, and fruit orchards. People's communes throughout the province implement two-level ownership by the commune and the management area, and three-level construction by the commune, the management area, and the production team. Communes, management areas, and production teams all engage in base farms, and carry out the "10,000, 1,000, 100" movement of communes raising 10,000 pigs, management areas raising 1,000 pigs, and production teams raising hundreds of pigs. Many communes have established "10,000 Pig Farms", "10,000 Chicken Mountains", and "10,000 Duck Bays". Rural people's commune organizations at all levels have developed more than 48,000 small and medium-sized commodity production base farms. In addition, some base counties have also been developed, including ten base counties with large-scale high-yield pig and poultry production, ten fish and duck base counties producing more than 1,000 tons of commodity fish, twenty vegetable base counties providing more than 10,000 tons of vegetables, six soil alkali base counties providing more than 1,000 tons of alkali, eight grass and reed base counties providing more than 10,000 tons of grass and reeds, and 24 newly developed sericulture base counties, six pine resin base counties, twelve hemp base counties, and ten wild fur base counties.

At present, the commodity production bases in Heilongjiang Province have developed to a new period, the main signs of which are: (1) The supply of urban non-staple foods has developed from relying mainly on rural areas to self-sufficiency as the main focus. Urban vegetables have basically achieved self-sufficiency, with an average of more than one jin of vegetables per person per day, changing the historical situation of "southern vegetables being transported to the north." Harbin and Jiamusi have already achieved more than self-sufficiency. The production of meat, eggs, and fish has also laid a solid foundation for great development. The self-sufficient production of non-staple foods in institutions, enterprises, troops, and schools has also developed greatly. Some units have not only achieved self-sufficiency, but have also supported the market. (2) In diversified operations, the proportion of collective large-scale production has accounted for an absolute advantage. Diversified operations have developed from the subordinate position of sideline production to the "one-word side-by-side king" position with grain as the key and agriculture and animal husbandry as the focus; the principle of public raising as the main focus, with both public and private raising, has been implemented. Horses, cattle, sheep are all publicly raised, and more than 50% of pigs and poultry are collectively raised. The vegetables supplied to the market are basically produced by commodity production bases. (3) The content of base operation has developed from mainly grain to non-staple foods and diversified operations, and then to industrial raw materials, with both specialized bases and comprehensive bases. (4) Commodity production bases have developed from points to areas, and from state-run demonstration bases to state-run bases as the backbone and commune bases as the foundation, forming a commodity production base network. At present, these bases are growing and developing, striding forward in the direction of production base and base modernization.

The formation of the commodity production base network has not only greatly promoted the development of the entire commodity production, but also made the content of production more substantial and rich. In the rural areas, a comprehensive and comprehensive development with a center and a backbone was carried out with the expansion of the amount of commodities as the center, focusing on four major non-staple foods (pigs, vegetables, poultry, and fish) and seven major raw materials (pine resin, alkali soil, silkworm cocoons, fur, grass and reeds, tobacco, hemp, and iron sulfide), that is, "fifty major diversified operations", including ten major breeding (pigs, horses, cattle, sheep, poultry, fish, silkworms, bees, rabbits, beasts), ten major planting (vegetables, fruits, sugar, oil, melons, tobacco, reeds, medicine, seeds, hemp), ten major boiling (salt, alkali, brine, potassium, nitrate, oil, wine, sugar, powder, glue), ten major weaving (bags, holes, baskets, braids, mats, curtains, cushions, baskets, baskets, bamboo hats), ten major collecting (ore, pine resin, acorns, grapes, Chinese medicine, cockleburs, grass reeds, hazelnuts, wood ear, mushrooms), so that all possible productions in rural areas have achieved a comprehensive leap forward and bumper harvest. The number of pigs in stock at the end of 1959 increased by more than 60% compared with 1958, poultry production doubled, and fishery production increased by about 40%. Many products that previously relied entirely on foreign supply have also had unprecedented development. With the development of production, the total amount of local and special product procurement by the commercial sector in 1959 also increased by more than 50% compared with the Great Leap Forward in 1958. On this basis, in a short period of time, we will be able to rely on the base to solve the growing needs of the broad masses for commodity production.

Some Basic Experiences in Establishing Commodity Production Bases

In order to develop commodity production bases more, faster, better, and more economically, we have adhered to putting politics in command, carrying out mass movements in a big way, and implementing the policy of "walking on two legs." The specific methods are:

First, the province, the region, the city, and the county combine, and the four troops of agriculture and forestry, finance and trade, institutions and enterprises, and people's communes advance, each with its own focus, and at the same time, the whole people run bases in a big way. State-owned farms and ranches implement agriculture and animal husbandry as the main business, and engage in diversified operations in a big way to increase the amount of commodities, as the backbone for supplying the market and export. The commercial service department runs non-staple food production and supply bases to directly combine production and the market, so that the bases become living warehouses and reservoirs of commodities. The commune, according to the resource conditions, runs medium and small-sized base farms as the basis for developing commodity production and increasing the amount of commodities. Institutions and enterprises engage in self-sufficient non-staple food production, which has also played an important role in solving the supply of non-staple foods. Because of adopting this method of combining the upper and lower levels, combining the large, medium and small, and combining various departments, a strong commodity production base network was quickly built throughout the province, driving the comprehensive development of commodity production. With such a base network, the source of commodities has a stable and reliable foundation, can withstand any wind and grass, and make the commodity supply invincible.

Second, combine production and sales, combine production and processing, combine production and purchase, to promote the rapid development of various industrial raw material production bases and give play to the commercial sector's active role in directly contacting the market, serving production, connecting production and sales, and connecting all parties. For relatively scattered products, in the key producing areas of industrial raw materials, adopt the methods of purchasing networks, purchasing points going up the mountain, and establishing specialized purchasing stations to support and promote the production in these areas. These purchasing networks, purchasing points, and specialized purchasing stations are both organizers of production and operators of commodities. It helps the local planning production, cultivate resources, conduct technical guidance, local production, local procurement, and local processing of finished products or semi-finished products. This plays an important role in the development of industrial raw material bases and solves the contradiction between the seasonal production and perennial needs of some mountain products and local specialties.

Third, adapt to local conditions, implement diversified operations, and engage in comprehensive utilization in a big way. Grain farms take grain as the main business, and implement the combination of grain and animal husbandry, use agricultural by-products to feed pigs, and use pig manure to fertilize the fields. Forestry takes the production of timber as the main business, and implements the combination of timber production and forest chemical industry and other diversified operations. Combine the breeding of pigs and poultry with the development of processing industries such as oil, wine, and starch, use feed grains and bran to make wine and oil, and use cake residue to feed pigs and poultry. Implement the combination of planting vegetables and raising rabbits, and the combination of raising fish and raising ducks. Raise fish under the water and raise ducks on the water, use duck manure to feed fish, and use pond mud to fertilize the fields. In this way, we can fully tap the potential of labor, the potential of resources, and the potential of equipment to increase production, increase the amount of commodities, and ensure a continuous increase in income. However, it is not required that every base has everything, but adapt to local conditions, according to their own resource conditions, with one or two varieties as the focus, so that the combination of key operations and diversified operations and comprehensive utilization.

Fourth, pay attention to proportional relationships, implement comprehensive planning for base construction, make overall arrangements, consider both current needs and long-term plans, in order to avoid blindness. How many pigs, how many fish, how much poultry should be raised in a base farm now and in the future, how much feed land, how much water area, how much manpower, how much equipment, and transportation conditions, etc., should be considered as a whole, there should be a proportion, and develop according to the proportion.

Fifth, implement the policy of starting from scratch and running the farm diligently and thriftily. Adopt the methods of taking materials locally, building the farm, utilizing it, producing it, and benefiting it at the same time, and relying on the masses and self-reliance. In this way, the construction of the base has been accelerated. Many places engage in "cave" livestock houses, "grass raft" livestock houses, and "four no" (no wood, nails, bricks, or tiles) livestock houses, which save money, save materials, and are strong and durable. Therefore, at the beginning of the establishment of the base, we must grasp economic accounting, grasp investment quotas, infrastructure quotas, and labor quotas; at the same time, we must also strengthen planning management and financial management, and establish some necessary systems.

Sixth, combine indigenous and foreign methods and carry out technological revolution in a big way. Due to the rapid development of base production, there is a shortage of labor and animal power, and it is urgent to reform technology and realize mechanization. Moreover, the bases are mostly large-scale and collective large-scale production, which has relatively superior conditions for realizing mechanization. On this issue, some places want foreign methods and rely solely on national supply, without doing anything themselves. As a result, the foreign methods are unreliable, and even the indigenous methods are delayed. We criticized this idea and insisted on relying on the masses, using indigenous methods, and carrying out technological revolution in a big way. As a result, a large number of tools and equipment were reformed, and many mechanized and semi-mechanized base farms appeared. This has played a great role in reducing heavy physical labor, improving labor efficiency, improving business management, and solving the problems of insufficient labor and animal power.

Strengthening the Party's leadership and carrying out mass movements in a big way are the decisive conditions for us to quickly establish a commodity base network. In order to strengthen the Party's leadership over this work, we have stipulated that each level of the Party Committee should have a secretary personally in charge, and transferred a large number of backbones and technical forces to form a professional team for base production. The provincial-level production bases are under the dual leadership of the province and the county (city), with the provincial leadership as the main focus. Plans, commodities, and investments are uniformly arranged by the province, and cadres are managed at different levels. Under the leadership of the Party, a great collaboration of agriculture, industry, commerce, youth, women's federations, science, and health and other departments has been organized, and a new atmosphere of old farms supporting new farms, old bases supporting new bases, and mutual support between departments has emerged. In order to fully mobilize the masses and mobilize the production enthusiasm of the masses, a red flag competition movement of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward has been widely and deeply carried out, and a large number of production experts and red flag hands on the vegetable, animal husbandry, and aquaculture fronts have emerged, and many advanced experiences have been created and promoted. At present, the construction of commodity production bases throughout the province is in a new and vigorous development climax.

Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and under the correct leadership of the Central Committee, with the high-speed development of the entire national economy, the construction of commodity production bases in Heilongjiang Province has achieved certain results. We will continue to strengthen leadership, rely on the masses, and learn from the advanced experience of fraternal regions, and work hard with modesty and prudence to realize the base of commodity production, the modernization of base production, and better guarantee the development of production and construction and the needs of the people's lives.

    论建立商品生产基地网
    中共黑龙江省委书记　杨易辰
    建立基地网是发展商品生产的必然趋势
    建立商品生产基地，用大生产的办法，大量地、集中地增加商品生产，是生产飞跃发展、人民生活日益提高的客观要求，是形势发展所决定的。
    黑龙江省在党中央、毛泽东同志的英明领导和全国人民大力支援下，经过国家在第一个五年计划期间的重点建设和1958—1959年连续两年的大跃进，已经由一个原来工业基础极为薄弱的、贫穷落后的“北大荒”，变成了国家的一个以重工业为中心、以现代化大型企业为骨干的新的重要工业基地。工业产值在工农业总产值中的比重已达75％左右。由于工业生产发展十分迅速，城市工矿林区人口增加很快，1959年比1952年增加一倍多。妇女也出来参加生产，城市无闲人，到处是“双职工”，购买力提高得很快。因此，对副食品和日用工业品的要求数量越来越大，品种越来越多，质量越来越高。
    在历史上，城市所需要的副食品，是依靠农村供应的。由于现在城市人口迅速增加，农村人口相对减少，城乡人口的比例变化很快。1952年黑龙江省是三个半农村人口供应一个城市人口的需要，现在变为一个半农村人口供应一个城市人口的需要。而且黑龙江省农村的农副产品，除了供应本省城市需要之外，还担负了支援全国的任务。这是一方面。另一方面，随着农业生产的发展，农民收入的迅速增加，农村生活水平已有显著的提高，广大农民已不再单纯地满足于粮食的消费了，在满足粮食供应的基础上，人民生活提高的主要趋势是向副食品和日用工业品方面发展。因此，黑龙江省的副食品生产，近几年来虽然有很大发展，但某些品种的商品率提高得不够快，不能迅速拿出更多的商品来满足城市日益增长的消费需要。
    农业生产实现了集体化以后，粮食生产发展很快，但是菜、猪、禽、蛋等副食品生产，还更多的属于分散的、家庭的、个体的生产，主要靠园田地、饲料地种菜，种饲料，养猪，养禽，这种生产基本上还是自给性的生产，商品量较少，商品率较低。因此，农业中的多种经营和迅速发展的粮食生产比较起来，还是一条“短腿”。在这种情况下，再完全依靠农村生产来供应城市副食品日益增长的需要就感到吃力了。
    随着生产的飞跃发展，社会购买力迅速上升，城乡人民的生活需要日益丰富多彩。他们不仅需要大量的副食品，而且还要求供应数量更多、品种更全、质量更高、物美价廉的日用工业品。而黑龙江省的工业主要是重工业，轻工业的基础比较薄弱，相对地说，轻工业也是一条“短腿”。长期以来很多日用工业品都依靠兄弟省市的支援。这就迫切需要迅速地发展轻、化工业。而发展轻、化工业所需要的原料，又大部分来自农村。这就要求农村在继续增产粮食的同时，必须组织专业队大力发展轻、化工业原料的生产。
    黑龙江省地域辽阔，土质肥沃，江河纵横，山林茂密，还有一望无际的草原。这些又都是发展商品生产的极为有利的资源条件。尤其是随着人民公社的建立、巩固和健全发展，又为统一规划生产，综合利用资源，合理组织人力、物力、财力，建立商品生产基地，发展国营和集体的大生产，开辟了广阔的前途。因此，全省的商品基地网就在原有国营农、牧场和副食品基地的基础上，迅速地发展起来了。
    建立商品生产基地的“三结合”方针
    黑龙江省建立商品生产基地的发展过程是：从国家办农、牧场，到商业服务部门搞基地，进而发展到人民公社搞基地；从以商品粮基地为主，到大量地发展副食品和多种经营的商品基地，进而到发展工业原料基地。最初，是由国家投资建立了一批谷物农场和畜牧场，十多年来，为国家提供了大量的商品粮和畜产品，这是国家办基地的老底子。1956年高级合作化以后，由于生产大发展，购买力大提高，副食品的需要量增加很快，因而某些副食品的生产就显得跟不上需要。为了解决这个问题，我们一方面抓了群众性的菜、猪、禽、鱼的生产；另方面，农业部门和商业服务部门密切协作，开始建立了一些副食品生产基地。其中除建立十三处蔬菜基地外，还创办了一些猪、禽、鱼等饲养场。由于抓了蔬菜，生猪和其他副食品生产，显著地改变了副食品的供应情况。它证明了财贸部门从生产入手，配合有关部门建立商品生产基地，不仅可以大大增加商品量，而且可以更好地带动群众性的副食品生产。1957年，我们总结了商业服务部门试办副食品生产基地的经验，并在省委财贸会议上把它列为财贸工作为生产服务、促进生产发展的方法之一，提出对商品性大的副食品、土副产品的生产，农、商部门要密切协作，搞商品生产基地。在交通不便的山区和边远区，商业部门要建立必要的加工或半加工企业，做到就地生产、就地收购、就地加工。这样，随着1958年的大跃进，商品生产基地就有了很大的发展。仅商业部门办的猪、禽基地就由1956年的三十八处，发展到1958年的一百三十二处。生产总值提高了二十倍，猪增长了九十二倍，禽增长了八倍。这对进一步扩大商品生产和保证市场供应，都起了很大的作用。齐齐哈尔市郊区雅尔塞农场是其中比较突出的一个。这个以生产副食品为主的农场，是在1957年末，由商业系统下放干部和两个高级农业生产合作社相结合办起来的。到1958年底，他们又吸收了人民公社的十八个管理区（生产大队）。由于他们种了很多菜，养了很多猪、牛、羊、禽、鱼，在副食品的供应上，发挥了“活仓库”的作用。市场上菜缺了，农场的菜就大量上市；市场上菜多了，农场的菜就储存起来。既保证了市场的供应，又保持了蔬菜价格的稳定。由于他们大搞多种经营，建场一年来，不仅向市场上供应了大量的蔬菜等副食品，而且还增加收入三十多万元。雅尔塞农场的经验，给国家建立商品生产基地指出了方向，促进了全省农、牧场从比较单纯地经营谷物或畜牧，向以粮食或畜牧为主大搞多种经营的方向发展，并进而推动了机关、企业、部队、学校搞副食品自给性生产的高潮。
    1959年，随着人民公社的巩固和发展，黑龙江省不仅国营商品生产基地有了很大发展，而且人民公社根据自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的方针，也办起了商品生产基地。尚志县苇河人民公社就是一个很好的榜样。他们在1959年春天，划出几个土地瘠薄而牧副渔资源又异常丰富的生产队，建立了畜牧、渔、蜂、蚕、蔬菜、水果等八个商品生产基地场。这八个基地场都是以一两个品种为主，实行综合经营的。有了基地以后，过去办不到的事办到了，发展慢的变快了，商品量扩大了。他们从无到有地发展了养蚕事业和养鱼事业。原来他们的蔬菜是不能自给的，到1959年，不仅做到了自给，还拿出了二百多万斤的商品菜，并发展了温室生产，做到了四季长青。猪羊增长一倍多，牛增长50％，蜂由一千多箱发展到四千多箱。这几个基地场，虽然都是新建立起来的，但建立的当年就拿出六十多万元的商品，商品率达77％，为公社增加了十七万多元的积累，占全公社积累的40％。苇河人民公社创办商品生产基地的经验，给公社建立商品生产基地指出了方向，推动了全省人民公社大办商品生产基地的高潮。
    1959年上半年，省委总结了雅尔塞农场和苇河人民公社举办商品生产基地的经验、机关企业进行自给性生产的经验，肯定了国家建立商品生产基地是发展商品生产的骨干力量，人民公社建立商品生产基地是发展商品生产的基础力量，机关企业进行自给性生产也是发展副食品生产的重要方面。省委提出发展和建立商品生产基地，是实现商品生产大发展的一项战略性的任务。在大搞商品生产基地的同时，应当普遍发展群众性生产，家家户户养猪、禽，充分挖掘潜力，做到人尽其才，这也是扩大商品生产增加商品量的重要来源。我们根据党的一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，提出了“国家、公社搞基地，机关、企业搞自给，普遍发展群众性生产”的三结合的方针。1959年7月，中央财贸部在黑龙江省召开的农村财贸工作座谈会，肯定了这种做法。8月份，省委在镜泊湖召开了全省商品生产基地会议，制定了商品生产基地的发展规划，以及政策、措施。各级党委都加强了对这一工作的领导，全省商品生产基地有了普遍的、突飞猛进的发展。不仅有为数众多的粮食和副产品生产基地，而且还根据发展轻、化工业的需要，建立了一批松香、土碱、蚕茧、皮毛、烟、麻、硫化铁等工业原料的生产基地。开始形成一个星罗棋布的商品生产基地网。同时，根据公养为主，公养私养并举的方针，对农村的广大社员家庭饲养家畜家禽的问题上采取了公有私养和私有私养等办法，因而群众性副业生产也有了发展。
    商品生产基地显示的巨大优越性
    商品生产基地的发展，不是一帆风顺的。在建立基地的初期，有人认为“建立商品生产基地会和粮食争土地、争劳力，影响粮食生产”；有人认为“商业部门搞基地是不务正业，会影响购销业务”；也有人特别提倡“让社员家庭大搞副业生产，以便调动广大社员的积极性”。这不仅是少慢差费和多快好省两种方法的斗争，实质上也包含着社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。我们及时地批判和克服了这些错误的思想和论点，指出只要按照统筹兼顾，全面安排的原则办事，不仅不会影响粮食生产，反而能互相推动，互相促进，作到人尽其才，地尽其力，物尽其用。我们认为，财贸部门只有积极支援和促进商品生产基地的发展，才能为市场供应提供雄厚的物资基础，在不妨碍集体生产的条件下，利用社员的非正式劳动时间和老弱劳动力，去发展社员家庭副业，也是不可忽视的一个方面。同时也指出，建立和发展商品生产基地是形势发展所决定的，是不能动摇的。事实证明，商品生产基地一经建立，就显示了它的巨大的作用。
    （一）商品量大大增加，保证了市场供应，稳定了市场物价。1959年，全省国营农场的小麦和大豆商品率，达80％以上；肥猪商品率达到70％左右。国营商品生产基地雅尔塞农场商品率达70％多，苇河人民公社的商品生产基地商品率达77％，仅仅国营商品生产基地提供的商品量就占全省采购总量：肥猪11％，禽33．5％，鱼25％。这还只是初办阶段，就发挥了很大作用，随着基地的更大发展，商品量的比重将会越来越大。商品生产基地的好处还在于什么时候用，什么时候取，多用多取，少用少取。它是供应市场的活仓库。市、县基地也发挥了巨大作用。作为生猪生产基地的拜泉县，三个半农业人口就提供一头商品猪，而全省平均每十个农业人口才提供一头商品猪。过去省内一向不能生产而全靠外地支援的松香、硫酸和蚕茧等产品，也开始大量生产了，为发展轻、化工业创造了条件。
    （二）可以不断地发展人民公社的公社经济和全民所有制。在国营商品基地的不断发展壮大过程中，吸收了一部分人民公社或管理区，这样就使全民所有制的比重不断增长。同时，人民公社社办商品生产基地的发展将会不断发展公社一级的经济事业，增加公社一级的收入，而且公社的商品生产基地多半建立在穷区，这就更有利于帮助穷区赶上富区，并为将来逐步向公社所有制过渡创造条件。
    （三）加速技术改造，带动农业技术革命，促进农业现代化和公社工业化的发展。黑龙江省国营的大型农、牧场已基本上实现了机械化；商品生产基地机械化的速度也很快。新办的雅尔塞农场，仅两年的时间全场就已有三分之一的耕地实行了引水灌溉，机耕面积达五分之一，工业的动力已全部电气化，非田间作业机械化已达三分之一左右。同样，人民公社的商品生产基地机械化的速度也较快。这是因为基地扩大了商品生产，使资金迅速增加，也就必然为加速实现农业现代化和公社工业化创造了有利条件。
    （四）创造丰产纪录，更好地带动群众生产。许多基地创造了高速度发展生产的纪录。有十三个基地县创造了生猪大面积丰产的经验。阿城县玉泉镇青年畜牧场创造了一头母猪一年三代产百仔的纪录。很多基地大胆地改革了饲养方法和植物栽培方法。对推动整个农村的农、林、牧、副、渔的生产起了很大作用。
    向生产基地化和基地现代化阔步前进
    自从黑龙江省委提出“国家、公社搞基地，机关企业搞自给，普遍发展群众性生产”三结合的方针以后，各地就形成了一个声势浩大、规模壮阔、全民大办商品生产基地的高潮，开始建立了一个强大的商品生产基地网。全省已有七十五处大型国营农、牧场，与市县的一百五十多个中小型农牧场相结合，构成了一个强大的国营农、牧场群。商业服务部门创办了二百一十五处副食品生产基地，其中省营的大型基地场，有水产养殖场十一处，以养猪为中心的畜牧场十四处，还有不少野生动物繁殖场，养蚕场和果树园。全省人民公社实行社、区两级所有，社、区、队三级建场，社社、区区、队队都搞基地场，开展了公社养万头猪、管理区养千头猪、生产队养几百头猪的“万、千、百”运动。很多公社都建立了“万猪场”、“万鸡山”、“万鸭湾”。农村人民公社各级组织已发展了四万八千多个中小型商品生产基地场。此外，还发展了一些基地县，其中有猪、禽大面积丰产的基地县十个，有产千吨以上商品鱼的鱼鸭基地县十个，有提供万吨以上菜的蔬菜基地县二十个，有提供上千吨碱的土碱基地县六个，有提供上万吨草苇的草苇基地县八个，还新发展了蚕业基地县二十四个，松香基地县六个，大麻基地县十二个，野生皮张基地县十个。
    现在，黑龙江省商品生产基地已经发展到了一个新时期，它的主要标志是：（一）城市副食品供应已由依靠农村为主，发展到以自给为主。城市蔬菜已经基本自给，每人每天平均达到一斤多菜，改变了历史上“南菜北运”的情况。哈尔滨、佳木斯两个市已经作到了自给有余。肉、蛋、鱼的生产也打下了大发展的雄厚基础。机关、企业、部队、学校的副食品自给性生产也有了很大发展，有些单位不仅作到了自给，还支援了市场。（二）在多种经营上，集体的大生产的比重已占绝对优势。多种经营已经由从属的副业地位发展到与以粮为纲，农、牧并举的“一字并肩王”地位；贯彻执行了公养为主，公养私养并举的方针。马牛羊已全部公养，集体饲养的猪、禽已达50％以上。市场供应的蔬菜已基本由商品生产基地进行生产。（三）基地经营内容由主要是粮食发展到副食品和多种经营，进而发展到工业原料，专业基地和综合基地并举。（4）商品生产基地已由点发展到面，并由国家办示范基地，发展到以国家基地为骨干，以公社基地为基础，形成了商品生产基地网。目前，这些基地正在日益发展壮大，向着生产基地化，基地现代化的方向阔步前进。
    商品生产基地网的形成，不但大大地推动了整个商品生产的发展，而且使生产内容更加充实和丰富了。在农村，有中心有骨干地全面地开展了以扩大商品量为中心，以四大副食（猪、菜、禽、鱼），七大原料（松香、土碱、蚕茧、皮毛、草苇、烟麻、硫化铁）为重点的“五十大项多种经营”，即十大养（猪、马、牛、羊、禽、鱼、蚕、蜂、兔、兽）、十大种（菜、果、糖、油、瓜、烟、苇、药、籽、麻）、十大熬（盐、碱、卤、钾、硝、油、酒、糖、粉、胶）、十大编织（袋、穴、篮、辫、席、帘、垫、筐、篓、笈）、十大采集（矿石、松脂、橡子、葡萄、中药、苍耳、草苇、榛子、木耳、蘑菇），使农村力所能及的各项生产全面地实现了大跃进和大丰收。生猪1959年末存栏数比1958年增长了60％以上，家禽生产翻了一番，渔业生产增加了40％左右。许多过去全部依靠外地供应的产品，也有了空前的发展。随着生产的发展，1959年商业部门土副产品采购总额也比大跃进的1958年增长了50％多。在这个基础上，用不了多长时间，我们就有可能依靠基地解决广大群众对商品生产日益增长的需要了。
    建立商品生产基地的一些基本经验
    为了多快好省地发展商品生产基地，我们坚持了政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，贯彻执行了“两条腿走路”的方针。具体的作法是：
    一、省、地、市、县各级结合，农林、财贸、机关企业、人民公社四路进军，各有重点，同时并举，全民大办基地，国营农、牧场实行以农、牧为主，大搞多种经营，增加商品量，作为供应市场和出口的骨干。商业服务部门举办副食品生产供应基地，使生产和市场直接结合起来，使基地成为商品的活仓库、贮水池。公社根据资源条件，举办中、小型的基地场，作为发展商品生产、增加商品量的基础。机关企业搞自给性的副食品生产，对解决副食品供应也起了重要作用。由于采取这种上下结合，大中小结合，各部门结合的办法，就很快地在全省范围内建成了一个强大的商品生产基地网，带动了商品生产的全面大发展。有了这样的基地网，就使商品来源有稳固、可靠的基础，经得起任何风吹草动，使商品供应立于不败之地。
    二、产销结合，生产和加工结合，生产和收购结合，以促进各种工业原料生产基地迅速发展，发挥商业部门直接接触市场、服务生产、连接产销、联系各方的积极作用。对比较分散的产品，在工业原料的重点产区，采取收购网、收购点上山和设立专业采购站的办法，以扶持与促进这些地区的生产。这些收购网、收购点和专业收购站，既是生产的组织者，也是商品的经营者。它帮助当地规划生产，培育资源，进行技术指导，就地生产，就地采购，就地加工成品或半成品。这对工业原料基地的发展起着重要作用，解决了某些山产、土特产品季节生产和常年需要的矛盾。
    三、因地制宜，实行多种经营，大搞综合利用。谷物农场以粮食为主，实行谷物和畜牧结合，用农业副产品喂猪，猪粪肥田，林业以生产木材为主，实行生产木材和林产化学等多种经营结合。饲养猪、禽和发展油、酒、淀粉等加工业相结合，用饲料粮和糠麸制酒制油，用饼糟喂养猪、禽。实行种菜和养兔相结合，养鱼和养鸭相结合。水下养鱼，水上养鸭，鸭粪喂鱼，塘泥肥田。这样，就能充分挖掘劳动潜力、资源潜力和设备潜力，以增加生产，提高商品量，保证经常增加收入。但也不是要求每个基地都样样俱全，而是因地制宜，根据自己的资源条件，以一两个品种为重点，使重点经营和多种经营、综合利用结合起来。
    四、注意比例关系，对基地建设实行全面规划，统筹安排，既考虑当前需要，又有长远打算，以避免盲目性。一个基地场，现在和将来，要养多少猪，多少鱼，多少禽，相应的需要多少饲料地，多少水面，多少人力，多少设备，以及运输条件等等，都要通盘考虑，有个比例，按比例发展。
    五、贯彻白手起家，勤俭办场的方针。采取就地取材，边建场、边利用、边生产、边收益，和依靠群众，自力更生的办法。这样，就加快了基地的建设。很多地方搞“窑洞”畜舍，“草筏子”畜舍，“四不用”（不用木材、钉子、砖、瓦）畜舍，既省钱、省料又坚固耐用。因此，在基地建立之初，就要抓经济核算，抓投资定额、基建定额和劳动定额；同时，也要加强计划管理和财务管理，建立一些必要的制度。
    六、土洋结合，大搞技术革命。由于基地生产的迅速发展，劳、畜力不足，迫切需要改革技术，实现机械化。而基地又多是大型的、集体的大生产，有比较优越的条件实现机械化。在这个问题上，有的地方要洋的，单纯依靠国家供应，自己不动手。结果洋的靠不上，连土的也耽误了。我们批判了这种思想，坚持依靠群众，土法上马，大搞技术革命，结果改革了大量工具和设备，出现了不少机械化和半机械化的基地场。这对减轻笨重的体力劳动，提高劳动效率，改善经营管理，解决劳、畜力不足等问题都起了很大作用。
    加强党的领导，大搞群众运动，是我们迅速建立起商品基地网的决定性条件。为了加强党对这一工作的领导，我们规定了各级党委都有一名书记亲自抓，并抽调了大批骨干和技术力量，组成基地生产的专业队伍。对省一级的生产基地，实行以省领导为主的省、县（市）双重领导，计划、商品、投资由省统一安排，干部实行分级管理。在党的领导下，组织农业、工业、商业、青年、妇联和科学、卫生等各部门的大协作，出现了老场支援新场，老基地支援新基地，部门之间相互支援的新风气。为了充分发动群众，调动群众的生产积极性，广泛深入地开展了学先进、比先进、赶先进、帮后进的红旗竞赛运动，涌现出大批的蔬菜、畜牧、水产战线上的生产能手和红旗手，创造和推广了很多先进经验。目前，全省商品生产基地的建设，正处在一个新的蓬勃发展的高潮中。
    在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在中央的正确领导下，随着整个国民经济的高速度发展，黑龙江省的商品生产基地的建设取得了一定的成绩。我们将继续加强领导，依靠群众，并学习兄弟地区的先进经验，谦虚谨慎地努力工作下去，为实现商品生产基地化，基地生产现代化，更好地保证生产建设的发展和人民生活的需要而奋斗。
