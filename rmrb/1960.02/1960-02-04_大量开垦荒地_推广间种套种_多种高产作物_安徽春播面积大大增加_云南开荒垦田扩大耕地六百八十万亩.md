This newspaper reports: Under the leadership of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the spring plowing and production campaign has led to a large increase in spring planting area compared to the same period last year. This is due to a sincere summary of the experiences of the Great Leap Forward over the past two years, and the identification of wasteland reclamation, intercropping, relay cropping, and diversification of spring-sown crops. On the basis of diversification, production increasing measures have been implemented, such as the cultivation of high-yield crops and the adoption of improved varieties, in order to strive for the policy of diversification, high yield, and abundant harvest.

As early as after the autumn harvest last year, Party committees at all levels in Anhui made many preparations for this year's spring plowing production, and formulated planting plans for spring-sown crops. According to this plan, the province will expand the planting area of early rice and spring sweet potatoes, and make use of the spring sweet potato fields to intercrop spring corn, cotton, hemp, tobacco and other economic crops, and the spring planting area plans have also been expanded compared with the same period last year. In order to expand this year's spring-sown crop area, the people's communes have so far reclaimed 6.1 million mu of wasteland. Since last winter, various localities have comprehensively prepared for spring plowing and production in terms of water conservancy, fertilizer, winter plowing, agricultural tools, and seeds. Now, a busy scene before the spring plowing and production is emerging everywhere in the province.

The experience summarized by the Anhui Provincial Committee of the CPC since the Great Leap Forward proves that vigorously expanding the spring-sown crop area is an important production increasing measure for agricultural production. Because spring sowing is extremely beneficial to crop growth, and can avoid the frequent droughts, floods, pests and diseases that occur between July and August, the yield is generally higher. According to a survey by the Provincial Committee, the single-season output of early rice can be increased by more than 10% compared with mid-season rice, spring sweet potatoes can be increased by 60% compared with summer sweet potatoes, and spring corn can be increased by more than 50% compared with summer corn. Spring-sown crops not only have high yields, but also enable the planting of a late autumn crop after the harvest of early-maturing spring crops, which improves land utilization. At the same time, striving for a bumper harvest of spring-sown crops lays a solid material and ideological foundation for striving for a bumper harvest in the whole year's agriculture.

This year, the measures taken by Anhui Province to expand spring-sown crops have been further developed compared with last year. For example, using wasteland reclamation to expand the spring-sown crop area not only taps the potential for increasing production, but also saves 40% of the labor per mu compared to mature land, because the newly reclaimed wasteland does not require fertilization in the first season. The intercropping of tall crops such as corn and short crops such as sweet potatoes can make full use of the land potential and increase the yield per unit area. For example, changing dry land to paddy fields can generally increase the yield by more than 200 jin per mu; changing to improved varieties is a simple and easy measure with a significant effect on increasing production. Taking rice as an example, improved varieties can increase the yield by 20% to 80% compared with ordinary varieties. These measures all meet the requirements of spending less money and increasing production.

This newspaper reports: Yunnan Province has made great achievements in wasteland reclamation. According to statistics on January 20th, the province has reclaimed more than 6.8 million mu of land.

Yunnan Province has a vast area of more than 600 million mu, but the cultivated land area only accounts for 6.5% of the total area. The province is sparsely populated, and there are still more than 14 million mu of flat wasteland suitable for reclamation, including more than 3.5 million mu of contiguous wasteland of more than 10,000 mu. The more than 500 large and medium-sized backbone water conservancy projects and the more than 100,000 small water conservancy projects newly built last winter and this spring can expand the irrigation area by 2 million mu. In particular, after some areas implemented "water conservancy to the mountains," many flat slopes and hilly areas can be turned into fertile fields, providing favorable conditions for reclamation. Years of experience have proven that the increase in production is relatively large in areas that have implemented the policy of combining diversification and high yields with high production. In 1959, Yunnan encountered a severe drought not seen in decades, but some communes had agricultural production increases as high as 50% to 100%. One of the important reasons was the expansion of the cultivated land area. Therefore, in order to achieve a large increase in this year's spring crops, the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the CPC decided to open up 2 million mu of new fields (including land converted to fields) and reclaim 4 million mu of wasteland in the province before spring plowing. As a result, a vigorous reclamation upsurge quickly formed.

Vigorously carrying out mass movements is the main feature of this year's reclamation. Before reclamation, various localities first conducted education on reclamation and production increase, and as a result, they received widespread support and a surge of activity. People's communes in various localities uniformly organized strong manpower and animal power, dispatched professional teams, carried luggage and tools, and went to barren mountains and wild fields to set up camps. On the millennia-dormant fertile land, red flags were fluttering and it was bustling with activity. "Mountains are never higher than the soles of our feet, and hard soil is never harder than the palms of our hands." This is their bold statement. On the Zhongdian Plateau, which is more than 3,000 meters above sea level, more than 2,000 farmers of Tibetan, Naxi, Yi, and Han ethnic groups braved the snow, driving 3,000 yaks, cattle, and a small number of tractors, plowing the frozen snow, and reclaiming 3,000 mu of wasteland every day. In Kunyang Commune, near Dianchi Lake, more than 1,200 people and more than 100 head of cattle were mobilized every day, and three water pumps and ten waterwheels were installed to drain water, build dikes, and seize land from Dianchi Lake. In addition to the professional teams opening up fields and land, various localities also organized several nationwide "annihilation battles," concentrating their efforts to attack one piece of land at a time.

Another feature of this year's reclamation in Yunnan is the close combination of large-scale water conservancy construction and large-scale land opening. The slogans in various localities are: "Where water conservancy is built, fields will be opened" and "Where there is water conservancy, fields will be opened," forming a situation where the fields are "running" in front and the water is "chasing" behind, catching up with each other and promoting each other. The Xiaomenglian Reservoir in Simao Prefecture has not yet been completed, but the wasteland near the reservoir has already been opened up into fields. The workers said: "The fields have already been opened and are waiting for water. Let's work harder and complete the task ahead of schedule." The Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture adopted the method of "linking reservoirs and ditches to land reclamation," building water conservancy and opening up fields at the same time.

This year's reclamation in Yunnan is facing a tight schedule and a large task. Therefore, after the upsurge of opening up new fields and new land, there was also a high-efficiency competition centered on large-scale reform of reclamation tools. At present, most of the province uses cattle plows instead of human digging, and implements soil pushing with scrapers. Some places have also created the method of opening up fields with blasting, and some places with tractors also use mechanical reclamation. Due to the widespread reform of tools, the efficiency of reclamation in various places has generally improved. The Banpozhai Management District of Donglv Commune in Pu'er County adopted advanced methods such as loosening the soil with water first and then plowing with cattle, which increased the efficiency by more than six times. After the secretary of the Wenshan County Party Committee helped a commune reasonably organize labor and reform tools, the number of workers required to open one mu of new field was reduced from 40 to 10 to 20.

    大量开垦荒地　推广间种套种　多种高产作物
    安徽春播面积大大增加
    云南开荒垦田扩大耕地六百八十万亩
    本报讯　中共安徽省委在领导春耕大生产运动中，由于认真总结了两年来大跃进的经验，找出了开荒和利用间种、套种及多种春播作物等办法，使春播面积比去年同期扩大很多；在多种的基础上，又采取多种高产作物，和全部采用良种等增产措施，力争实现多种高产多收的方针。
    安徽各级党委早在去年秋收以后，就为今年春耕生产做了许多准备工作，制订了春播作物的种植计划。根据这个计划，全省将扩大早稻、春山芋的播种面积，并利用春山芋地套种春玉米、棉花、麻类、烟叶等经济作物的春播面积计划也都比去年同期有所扩大。各人民公社为了扩大今年春播作物面积，目前已开垦荒地六百一十万亩。从去冬以来，各地又从水利、肥料、冬耕、农具、种子等方面，全面为春耕大生产做了准备。现在，全省处处呈现了春耕大生产前夕的繁忙景象。
    中共安徽省委总结的大跃进以来经验证明：大力扩大春播作物面积，是农业生产的一项重要增产措施。因为春播对作物生长极为有利，又可避开7、8月间经常发生旱涝灾害和病虫害，一般产量都比较高。据省委调查，早稻单产可比中稻提高10％以上，春山芋可比夏山芋提高60％，春玉米可比夏玉米提高50％以上。春播作物不仅产量高，而且春播的早熟作物收获后还能增种一季晚秋，提高土地利用率。同时，争取了春播作物大丰收，对争取全年农业大丰收奠定了雄厚的物质和思想基础。
    今年，安徽省在扩大春播作物方面所采取的措施中，比去年有了进一步发展。如采用开荒来扩大春播作物面积，既挖掘了增产潜力，又因新垦荒地第一季可以不施肥，每亩地用工量比熟地一般要节省40％。利用高秆作物玉米和矮秆作物山芋实行套种，可充分利用土地潜力，提高单位面积产量。再如，旱地改种水稻，每亩一般能增产二百多斤；改用良种，更是简便易行而增产效果很大的措施，以水稻为例，良种比一般品种能增产20％—80％。这些措施都符合花钱少、增产大的要求。
    本报讯　云南省开荒垦田成绩巨大。据1月20日统计，全省已开垦田地六百八十多万亩。
    云南省面积纵横广达六亿多万亩，但耕地面积只占总面积的6．5％。这里地广人稀，全省尚有适宜开垦的平坦荒地一千四百多万亩，其中连片的万亩以上的荒地有三百五十多万亩。去冬今春新修的五百多处大、中型骨干水利工程和十万多处小型水利工程，可以扩大灌溉面积两百万亩，特别是有些地区实行“水利上山”之后，可使许多平坡和丘陵地带变为良田，为垦荒提供了有利条件。历年的经验证明：凡是执行了多种多收与高额丰产相结合的方针的地区，增产幅度都比较大。1959年，云南遇到数十年未有的大旱，但是有些公社的农业增产幅度高达五成到一倍，重要的原因之一是扩大了耕地面积。因此，中共云南省委为了取得今年大春作物的大增产，决定春耕前在全省增辟新田两百万亩（包括地改田），开荒四百万亩。因而很快形成了声势浩大的开荒高潮。
    大搞群众运动是今年开荒的主要特色。各地在开荒之前，首先进行了垦荒增产的教育，因而一呼百应，万马奔腾。各地人民公社统一组织强大的人力和畜力，派出专业队伍，携带行李和工具，奔赴荒山野地，安营扎寨。在千年沉睡的沃土上，红旗招展，热气腾腾。“山高高不过脚底板，土硬硬不过手板心”，这就是他们的豪言壮语。在海拔三千多米的中甸高原上，两千多藏、纳西、彝、汉等民族农民，冒着雪花，驾驶着三千头牦牛、黄牛和一小部分拖拉机，犁开冰冻雪地，每日开荒达三千亩。在滇池旁的昆阳公社，每天出动了一千二百多人，一百多头耕牛，安设了三台抽水机和十张水车，边排涝，边打埂，边筑堤，向滇池夺田。除了专业队开田开地以外，各地还组织几次全民性的“歼灭战”，集中力量一块块地突击。
    今年云南开荒的另一个特点是，大修水利和大开田地紧密结合，真是坝高水涨，水到田成。各地的口号是：“水利修到哪里，田就开到哪里”、“哪里有水利，哪里就开田”，形成田在前面“跑”，水在后面“追”，你追我赶，相互促进的局面。思茅专区的小孟连水库还没修好，水库附近的荒地即已开辟成田，民工说：“人家田都开好等水了，我们再鼓一把劲，提前完成任务。”文山僮族苗族自治州采取“库沟对号开田”的办法，边修水利边开田地。
    今年云南开荒的时间紧，任务大，因此，在大开新田新地的高潮掀起之后，同时出现的是以大搞开荒工具改革为中心的高工效竞赛。目前全省大都采用牛犁代替人挖，实行了赶板推土化，有的地方还创造了爆破开田法，有拖拉机的地方还应用机械垦荒。由于广泛进行工具改革，各地的开荒工效普遍提高。普洱县东率公社半坡寨管理区，采取先放水松土，再用牛犁等先进方法，提高工效六倍多。文山县委书记帮助一个公社合理组织劳力和改革工具之后，由四十个工开一亩新田改为十至二十个工开一亩。
