    Under the leadership of the Party, the vast numbers of commune members in the people's communes have, since last winter, launched an unprecedented upsurge in water conservancy construction, pig raising and manure accumulation, and deep plowing to improve the soil. Recently, they have immediately started a new upsurge in preparing for spring plowing and strengthening field management of summer harvest crops. The commune members are full of energy and soaring enthusiasm, and a good situation of continued leap forward on the agricultural front in 1960 has already taken shape. Under the situation of the people's vigorous enthusiasm and continuous leap forward in production, the people's communes in various places, on the basis of doing a good job in distribution, should properly and comprehensively arrange the lives of the commune members. This has become a problem that should be given universal attention at present.
    Recently, the Party committees in many places, in conjunction with the distribution work, have arranged the grain use for each team and household, not only arranging the commune members' rations until the new grain is harvested, but also arranging for reserve grain; not only arranging the rations for all commune members, but also arranging the feed for livestock. The news about the You County Party Committee's arrangement of the life of commune members published in this newspaper today is a very good example. The facts in various places prove that this approach is very timely and completely necessary.
    The continuous leap forward in agricultural production in our country has enabled our farmers not only to live a stable and guaranteed life, but also to improve their living standards. The average income of the members of the people's communes in 1959 increased by about 10% compared with 1958. Under such circumstances, it is both necessary and possible to further organize the economic life of the people. The development of production guarantees the improvement of life, and the improvement of life promotes the development of production. Our slogan is to grasp production with one hand and life with the other. As long as we do this, the enthusiasm of the masses will surely increase, and the high tide of production will become higher and higher. People have a deep understanding of this in the practice of the two years of the Great Leap Forward.
    Comprehensively arranging the lives of the masses is a matter of great political significance. As early as the First Domestic Revolutionary War, Comrade Mao Zedong told us to "care for the lives of the masses and pay attention to working methods." At that time, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that "we are the leaders and organizers of the revolutionary war, and we are also the leaders and organizers of the lives of the masses." During the Great Leap Forward and after the people's communes were established, the Party Central Committee repeatedly pointed out that "we must pay attention to comprehensively grasping ideology, production, and life," "production and life must be grasped at the same time," and "the greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more the Party must care for the lives of the masses. The more the Party cares for the lives of the masses, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses will be." Caring for the lives of the masses is the glorious tradition of our Party. Our Party has always considered political tasks or production tasks together with the living problems of the masses. The idea and practice of treating production and life as if they have no connection, and only paying attention to arranging production but not paying attention to arranging the lives of the masses, is obviously wrong. It is also wrong to think that it is only necessary to arrange the lives of the masses when the material conditions are relatively difficult, and that it is not necessary to arrange the lives of the masses when the material conditions are relatively good.
    Only under the historical conditions of the people's communes can the lives of the masses be comprehensively arranged. It fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes. In the era of the small-scale peasant economy, where each household was a production unit and a living unit, there was a great disparity between the rich and the poor, the level of production was low, and the lives of most people were difficult. At that time, it was of course very difficult to comprehensively arrange the lives of the masses. Even in the era of advanced cooperatives, although people were united in production, they were still scattered in life, and there were certain limitations in comprehensively arranging the lives of the masses. After the establishment of the "large in size and collective in nature" people's communes, on the one hand, production has developed by leaps and bounds, providing a solid material foundation for arranging life; on the other hand, due to the establishment of public canteens, nurseries, and other public welfare undertakings, collective life has undergone new developments in many aspects, which has created very favorable conditions for comprehensively arranging the lives of the masses. The people's commune is both the organizer of production and the organizer of life. Relying on the superior social organization of the people's commune, we can completely plan the lives of the masses and gradually improve their living standards; we can also foresee various difficulties that may arise in a timely manner, and give full play to the superiority of the commune to overcome them in time, so that the living needs of the people can be basically guaranteed even in the event of unexpected circumstances.
    The central issue in comprehensively arranging the lives of the masses is planned grain use. Judging from the average consumption level of the agricultural population across the country, especially since the Great Leap Forward and the communization, people's lives have generally improved, and everyone is living better than in the past. However, it should also be pointed out that the level of grain production in our country, calculated per capita, is only more than 800 jin, which is still not rich. In order to make the lives of the people better, we must
    implement planned grain use and economize on grain use. The Party Central Committee has pointed out that grain must be collected, managed, and used well. In our country, production is planned, and consumption must also be planned; otherwise, it will affect production and also affect the steady improvement of the lives of the masses. To implement planned grain use is to make an overall arrangement for the annual rations in accordance with the spirit of looking ahead and leaving leeway, seeing both the present and the future, seeing both the slack season and the busy season, making careful calculations, and making the water flow slowly, so that all the days of the year can be arranged well. To implement planned grain use, we must adhere to thrift and oppose waste. The Party and Chairman Mao have repeatedly told us to "build the country diligently and thriftily, and manage the household diligently and thriftily." There is also a saying circulating among the people in our country: "Eating will not make you poor, wearing will not make you poor, not calculating will make you poor for life." Especially last year, some areas suffered severe natural disasters in agricultural production, and it is even more necessary to comprehensively implement the spirit of diligence and thrift. Disaster areas must increase production and save; bumper harvest areas must also increase production and save to support disaster areas. Therefore, whether it is arranging the lives of the masses or everyone treating their own lives, they must establish the idea of thrift. Without this idea, even if the material conditions are very good, they will not be able to live a good life; with this idea, even if the material conditions are poor, life can be arranged better. Many public canteens, due to the strengthening of leadership by the Party organizations and the implementation of careful calculations, have not only eliminated waste and saved grain, but also made the lives of the commune members good. For example, some places try every means to increase the production of vegetables and non-staple foods, and make various delicious foods by matching vegetables and grain, so that the food is improved and the commune members are very satisfied. For example, some public canteens in Acheng County, Heilongjiang Province, use grain and vegetables to make more than 30 kinds of foods such as steamed dumplings, pot stickers, noodles, and vegetable buns. Everyone reflects: "The rations are sufficient, the varieties are many, saving grain is delicious, and the enthusiasm for production is high." The people's communes in various places should conduct an inspection of the grain use situation in conjunction with the preparations for spring plowing, and be sure to make comprehensive and proper arrangements. If any problems are found, effective measures must be taken immediately to solve them quickly.
    Of course, the content of arranging the lives of the commune members is very broad and is not limited to grain use. At present, advocating the widespread cultivation of spring vegetables is an important measure to improve the lives of the masses. Regarding this work, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have issued instructions, and all localities must implement them. Further running public canteens and other collective welfare undertakings well is related to the vital interests of the vast number of commune members, and also to the consolidation of the people's communes. It requires the practical attention of leaders at all levels to make the canteens the organizers of improving the lives of the masses. After arranging the rations for the commune members, Hunan Province recently proposed to do a good job in storing firewood and repairing houses before the arrival of the rainy season according to the needs of the masses, and to further grasp vegetable production, which is very necessary. We must not only care about the material lives of the masses, but also care about the spiritual lives of the masses, and care about the cultural and recreational activities of the commune members, and so on.
    Grasping life is like grasping production, we must put politics in command and strengthen leadership. As long as the Party organizations attach importance to this issue, grasp it early, grasp it tightly, grasp it specifically and comprehensively, and are good at relying on the masses, the lives of the commune members will surely be arranged well. The Bin County Party Committee in Shaanxi Province convened six meetings to discuss the living problems of the masses. The responsible comrades of the County Party Committee divided the areas and contracted to specifically arrange the lives of the masses team by team and household by household. Now the rations of the masses in this county have been properly arranged until the new grain is harvested. In Wendeng County, Shandong Province, from the County Party Committee to the Commune Party Committee and the Brigade Branch, there is a secretary responsible for the leadership of collective welfare undertakings. The County Party Committee arranges the lives of the masses at the same time as deploying the central work, and also checks the arrangement of the lives of the masses at the same time as checking the central work. As a result, it has promoted the development and consolidation of collective welfare undertakings, and greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of the commune members for production. The Chuanshan People's Commune in Xiangyin, Hunan Province, grasps life like grasping production, with the Party Committee Secretary taking the lead, and conducts regular inspections and appraisals; and starts early, prepares early, and considers the eating and vegetable eating problems of the next season in the previous season; not only regards the arrangement of grain as the primary task, but also pays attention to solving the problems of heating, clothing, housing, rest, and women's childbirth of the commune members, and arranges the lives of the masses very comprehensively. The good practices and good experiences of these regions and many other regions are worthy of emulation by all regions.

### 全面安排社员生活

    全面安排社员生活
    人民公社广大社员在党的领导下，从去年冬天到现在，掀起了规模空前巨大的水利建设、养猪积肥和深耕改良土壤的高潮，最近，紧接着又开始了准备春耕，加强夏收作物田间管理的新高潮。社员们精神饱满，干劲冲天，1960年农业战线上继续跃进的大好局面已经形成了。在人民群众干劲充沛、生产持续跃进的形势下，各地人民公社在作好分配工作的基础上，妥善地全面安排社员群众的生活，这就成为当前应当引起普遍注意的问题。
    最近许多地方的党委都结合分配工作逐队逐户地安排用粮，不但把社员的口粮一直安排到接上新粮登场，而且安排了储备粮；不但安排了全体社员的口粮，而且安排了牲畜的饲料。本报今天发表的攸县县委安排社员生活的消息就是一个很好的例子，各地的事实证明，这样的作法是非常适时的，也是完全必要的。
    我国农业生产的连年跃进，使得我国农民不但过着安定的有保证的生活，而且生活水平有所提高。1959年人民公社社员的平均收入比1958年增长了10％左右。在这种情况下，进一步把人民群众的经济生活组织好，既有必要又有可能。生产的发展保证了生活的提高，生活的提高又促进了生产的发展。我们的口号是，一手抓生产，一手抓生活。只要这样做了，群众的干劲就一定越来越大，生产的高潮就越来越高。对此，在两年大跃进的实践中，人们是有着深切的体会的。
    全面地安排群众生活，是具有重大政治意义的事情。早在第一次国内革命战争时期，毛泽东同志就告诉我们要“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”。当时毛泽东同志就指出，“我们是革命战争的领导者、组织者，我们又是群众生活的领导者、组织者。”在大跃进中，在人民公社化以后，党中央又一再指出，“必须注意全面地抓思想、抓生产、抓生活”，“生产和生活两方面，必须同时抓起来”，“群众的干劲越大，党越要关心群众生活。党越是关心群众生活，群众的干劲也会越大。”关心群众生活，这是我们党的光荣传统。我们党从来就是把政治任务或生产任务同群众生活问题放在一起来考虑的。那种把生产和生活看成没有什么联系，只重视安排生产不注意安排群众生活的想法和做法，显然是错误的。认为在物质条件比较困难的时候才需要安排群众生活，在物质条件比较好的时候就不需要安排群众生活，这种想法和做法也是错误的。
    全面安排好群众的生活，这只有在人民公社化的历史条件下才能办得到。它充分显示出人民公社的无比的优越性。在一家一户就是一个生产单位和生活单位的小农经济时代，贫富悬殊，生产水平低下，大多数人民生活是困难的。那时要全面安排群众的生活，当然有很大的困难。即使在高级社时代，虽然人们在生产上联合起来了，但是生活上仍然是分散的，全面安排群众生活也有一定的限制。而在成立“一大二公”的人民公社以后，一方面生产有了飞跃的发展，为安排生活提供了坚实的物质基础；另一方面由于公共食堂、托儿所等公共福利事业的兴办，集体生活在许多方面有了新的发展，这样就为全面安排群众生活创造了很有利的条件。人民公社既是生产的组织者，又是生活的组织者。依靠人民公社这个优越的社会组织，我们完全可以有计划地安排群众生活，使群众的生活水平逐步得到提高；也可以及时预见到可能发生的各种困难，充分发挥公社的优越性来及时加以克服，使人民群众的生活需要即使在遭遇意外的情况下也得到基本保证。
    全面安排群众生活的中心问题是计划用粮。从全国农业人口的平均消费水平来看，特别是大跃进、公社化以来，人们的生活普遍改善了，大家的日子都比过去过得好了。但是，也应当指出，我国的粮食生产水平，按全国人口平均计算，每人只有八百多斤，还是不富裕的。为了使人民群众生活过得好，必须
    实行计划用粮，节约用粮。党中央曾经指出，对粮食必须收好、管好、用好。在我们国家里，生产都是有计划的，消费也必须有计划；否则就会影响生产，也会影响群众生活的稳步提高。实行计划用粮，就是要根据瞻前顾后、留有余地的精神对全年的口粮加以通盘安排，既看到眼前又看到将来，既看到农闲又看到农忙，精打细算，细水长流，把全年的日子都要安排好。实行计划用粮，必须坚持节约、反对浪费。党和毛主席一再告诉我们，要“勤俭建国，勤俭持家”。我国民间也流传着这样的说法：“吃不穷、穿不穷、计算不到一世穷”。特别是去年有些地区的农业生产遭受到严重的自然灾害，更要全面贯彻勤俭节约的精神，灾区固然要增产节约；丰收地区也要增产节约，支援灾区。因此，不论是安排群众生活，或是每个人对待自己的生活，都必须树立节俭的思想。没有这种思想，即使物质条件很好，也过不好日子；有了这种思想，即使物质条件较差，生活也可以安排得较好。许多地区的公共食堂由于党组织加强领导，实行精打细算的结果，不但消除了浪费现象，节约了粮食，而且社员生活也过得好。例如有的地方千方百计增加蔬菜和副食品的生产，把蔬菜和粮食搭配起来做出各种可口的食品，使伙食得到改善，社员们都很满意。像黑龙江阿城县一些公共食堂用粮食和菜做出蒸饺、锅烙、面条、菜包等食品三十多种。大家反映：“口粮足，花样多，节约粮食味道香，生产情绪齐昂扬”。各地人民公社应当结合备耕的准备工作，对用粮情况进行一次检查，务必做到全面安排，妥善安排。凡发现问题的，必须立即采取有效措施，迅速加以解决。
    当然，安排社员生活的内容很广，并不限于用粮。目前，提倡普遍地多种春菜就是改善群众生活的一个重要措施。关于这个工作，中共中央和国务院已经发布了指示，各地都必须贯彻执行。进一步办好公共食堂和其他集体福利事业，关系到广大社员的切身利益，也关系到人民公社的巩固，需要各级领导切实注意，使食堂成为改善群众生活的组织者。湖南省在安排了社员的口粮以后，最近又根据群众的需要，提出在雨季到来以前做好储存柴火、整修住房的工作，并且进一步抓好蔬菜生产，这是很必要的。我们不仅要关心群众的物质生活，而且要关心群众的精神生活，关心社员的文化娱乐活动等等。
    抓生活也如同抓生产一样，必须政治挂帅，加强领导。只要党组织重视这个问题，抓得早，抓得紧，抓得具体、全面，而且善于依靠群众，社员的生活就一定会安排得好。陕西邠县县委曾召开六次会议讨论群众生活问题，县委负责同志分片包干逐队逐户地具体安排群众生活，现在这个县的群众口粮，已经妥善安排到接上新粮登场。山东文登县从县委到公社党委、大队支部都有一个书记负责集体福利事业的领导，县委每次布置中心工作的同时也安排群众生活，检查中心工作也同时检查群众生活的安排情况，结果促进了集体福利事业的发展和巩固，大大调动了社员群众的生产积极性。湖南湘阴川山人民公社像抓生产那样抓生活，由党委书记挂帅，经常进行检查评比；并且早动手，早准备，上一季就考虑下一季的吃饭吃菜等等问题；既把粮食的安排当作首要工作，又注意解决社员的取暖、穿衣、住房、休息、妇女生育等问题，对群众生活安排得很全面。这些地区以及其他许多地区的好做法、好经验，都值得各地效法。
