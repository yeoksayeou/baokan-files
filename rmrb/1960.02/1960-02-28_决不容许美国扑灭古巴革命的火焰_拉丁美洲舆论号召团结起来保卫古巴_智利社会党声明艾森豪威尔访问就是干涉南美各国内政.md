Latin American Public Opinion Calls for Unity to Defend Cuba
The Chilean Socialist Party Declares Eisenhower's Visit is Interference in the Internal Affairs of South American Countries

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, February 27th: Cuban newspapers published commentaries, criticizing Eisenhower's sweet talk about "friendship" during his visit to Brazil.

The "Hoy" newspaper pointed out on the 27th, when discussing the so-called Brasilia Declaration issued by the United States and Brazil, which advocated "advancing the development of the entire hemisphere's economy," that the other side of these circumstances is: The United States' ten major monopolies control Brazil's economy through 367 enterprises, and they can recover all the capital invested in Brazil within six years. "Hoy" said that Washington is also preventing Brazil from breaking the U.S. monopoly on Brazil's foreign trade, and it opposes Brazil selling unsalable coffee to socialist countries that can provide the industrial equipment it needs under the pretext of the Cold War.

The newspaper emphasized that Eisenhower is attempting to get the Brazilian government to support imperialist aggression against Cuba; however, he cannot buy off the revolutionary and patriotic consciousness of the Brazilian nation that supports the Cuban revolution.

"Revolución" commented on the U.S. attempt to isolate Cuba, saying that the current world will never tolerate the establishment of a "cordon sanitaire" against Cuba. The people of Latin American countries will never allow themselves to be divided for the sake of trusts and monopolies.

"Combate" pointed out that Eisenhower remained silent in his speech about the current escalating racist persecution of his Black compatriots. The newspaper said that this is not surprising in a person who once supported the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, February 25th: The People's Movement for Latin American Liberation held a mass meeting at the Economic University here last night to commemorate Nicaraguan national hero Sandino. Prominent Guatemalan writer Asturias and others spoke at the meeting, condemning Eisenhower's visit to Latin America and "the State Department's and the U.S. big trusts' policy against the Cuban revolution." Speakers called on the people of all Latin American countries to unite to defend the Cuban revolution.

Sandino was a great Nicaraguan patriot who opposed U.S. imperialist aggression. From 1926 to 1933, he led the Nicaraguan people in a seven-year guerrilla war, finally forcing the U.S. Marines, who had invaded Nicaragua in 1909, to withdraw from Nicaragua. On February 21, 1934, the U.S. instructed the Nicaraguan dictator to assassinate him.

Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, February 25th: The weekly "Solución" published an editorial today stating that President Eisenhower's visit to South America "is to exchange economic aid for political support to defend the Western world" and "to extinguish the flames of Cuba." The editorial also said that the Argentine people want peace, but not a "peace aimed at destroying our brothers or Latin American brothers who are fighting for freedom."

The weekly published several articles spanning two full pages to respond to Eisenhower's remarks before leaving Washington. One article condemned the U.S. State Department's support for U.S. monopoly capital's "direct actions." The article pointed out that U.S. imperialism attempts to change our economy, making it subordinate to the United States, and it only considers its own interests, forever restricting the development of the Argentine economy.

The article said that U.S. big monopoly capital such as Morgan, Rockefeller, Mobil Oil Company, Loeb Bank, etc., control most of Argentina's oil, slaughterhouses, lead, zinc, silver, electricity and other industries, with annual profits ranging from 65% to 204%. U.S. investment "does not contribute to national capital accumulation, but rather damages national capital accumulation, and it takes out much more than it brings in." The article said that Argentina's compromise with the International Monetary Fund has brought national industries to the brink of bankruptcy.

Another article called for the abolition of all bellicose Pan-American treaties concluded with the United States, because "they do not conform to the current international reality and do not represent the interests of the Latin American people."

Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, February 26th: The Central Committee of the Chilean Socialist Party issued a statement today on Eisenhower's visit to South America, saying that no one in Latin America is unaware that the U.S. State Department is creating conditions for repeating the shameful armed intervention of a few years ago that overthrew the democratic regime in Guatemala in Cuba. The statement said that Eisenhower's visit is also to seek political support for launching an attack on Castro's revolutionary government. The United States is determined not to allow a government like Cuba, which sets a courageous example for the people of the Americas, to exist.

The statement referred to Eisenhower's recent meeting with dictator Franco in Madrid, saying, "This meeting fully demonstrates the State Department's outdated policy, which, as always, blatantly supports the most brutal dictatorships and the most reactionary rulers."

The statement said: "Eisenhower's embrace of Franco is the best Christmas gift for the likes of Trujillo, Somoza and Stroessner. Eisenhower's visit itself is also a form of interference in the internal affairs of our countries."

Xinhua News Agency, February 27th: Mexico City News: The "Mexico Daily News," published in the Mexican capital, recently published an editorial condemning the U.S.'s threatening policy towards Cuba.

The editorial pointed out that it is no accident that U.S. policy has caused fear and unease in Latin America. In the past, the U.S. Army and Navy have invaded and occupied the territory of Latin American countries countless times. The editorial then pointed out that Washington's policy towards Cuba has not changed in essence compared with its traditional policy of wanting to conquer and exploit the people of various countries. The editorial said that the people of Latin America are witnesses to the U.S.'s conspiracy against Cuba, because for more than a year, U.S. propagandists and politicians have been attempting to interfere in the internal affairs of this island nation.

The editorial pointed out that in order to conquer the Cuban people, the U.S. has used every possible threat: accusing the Cuban government of being "communist," "tyrannical" and "bloody," and even falsely claiming that "Cuba poses a fatal danger to the entire continent."

### 决不容许美国扑灭古巴革命的火焰  拉丁美洲舆论号召团结起来保卫古巴  智利社会党声明艾森豪威尔访问就是干涉南美各国内政

    决不容许美国扑灭古巴革命的火焰
    拉丁美洲舆论号召团结起来保卫古巴
    智利社会党声明艾森豪威尔访问就是干涉南美各国内政
    新华社哈瓦那27日电　古巴报纸发表评论，抨击艾森豪威尔在巴西访问期间所说的关于“友好”的甜言蜜语。
    “今日报”27日在谈到美国同巴西这次发表的、主张“向发展整个半球经济进军”的所谓巴西利亚声明时指出，这些情况的另一面是：美国的十大垄断组织通过三百六十七个企业控制着巴西的经济，它们在六年内就能够收回投入巴西的全部资本。“今日报”说，华盛顿还阻挠巴西打破美国对巴西对外贸易的垄断，它以冷战为借口，反对巴西把卖不掉的咖啡卖给可以提供它所需要的工业设备的社会主义国家。
    这家报纸强调指出：艾森豪威尔企图使巴西政府支持帝国主义对古巴的侵略；但是，他却收买不了支持古巴革命的巴西民族的革命和爱国主义的觉悟。
    “街道报”在评论美国企图孤立古巴的阴谋时说，现在的世界决不会容忍建立反对古巴的“防疫线”。拉丁美洲各国人民决不会为托辣斯和垄断集团使自己陷于分裂。
    “战斗报”指出，艾森豪威尔在他的演说中闭口不谈目前变本加历地对他的黑人同胞进行的种族主义迫害。这家报纸说，这在一个曾经支持对广岛和长崎投掷原子弹的人的身上，是不足为奇的。
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯25日电　争取拉丁美洲解放人民运动昨晚在这里的经济大学举行群众大会，纪念尼加拉瓜民族英雄桑地诺。危地马拉著名作家阿斯图里亚斯等人在会上发言，谴责艾森豪威尔到拉丁美洲访问和“国务院和美国大托辣斯反对古巴革命的政策”。发言人要求所有拉丁美洲国家的人民团结一致，来保卫古巴革命。
    桑地诺是尼加拉瓜反对美帝国主义侵略的伟大爱国者，曾经从1926年到1933年领导尼加拉瓜人民坚持了七年游击战争，终于迫使在1909年侵入尼加拉瓜的美国海军陆战队撤离尼加拉瓜。1934年2月21日，美国指使尼加拉瓜独裁者谋杀了他。
    据新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯25日电　今天出版的“解决”周刊发表社论说，艾森豪威尔总统访问南美，“是为了以经济援助换取政治上的支持以保卫西方世界”和“扑灭古巴的火焰”。社论又说，阿根廷人民要和平，但是却不要一种“旨在搞垮为争取自由而进行斗争的我们的兄弟或拉丁美洲的兄弟的和平”。
    这家周刊以两整页的篇幅刊登了几篇文章，来答复艾森豪威尔在从华盛顿动身前所发表的谈话。有一篇文章谴责了美国国务院支持美国垄断资本的“直接行动”。这篇文章指出，美帝国主义企图改变我们的经济，使它从属于美国，它只是考虑它本身的利益，永远限制阿根廷经济的发展。
    文章说，美国大垄断资本如摩根，洛克菲勒，美孚油公司，洛勃银行等控制着阿根廷大部分石油，屠场，铅、锌、银、电力等工业，每年所得利润为65％到204％。美国的投资“对国家积累资本没有贡献，而是有损于国家积累资本，它带出去的东西比拿进来的要多得多。”文章说，阿根廷同国际货币基金组织的妥协已经使民族工业濒于破产。
    另外一篇文章要求废除同美国缔结的一切好战的泛美条约，因为“它们不符合当前的国际现实，不代表拉丁美洲人民的利益”。
    新华社圣地亚哥26日电　智利社会党中央委员会今天就艾森豪威尔访问南美发表声明说，拉丁美洲没有人不知道美国国务院正在为在古巴重演几年前推翻危地马拉民主政权那种可耻的武装干涉创造条件。声明说，艾森豪威尔的访问也是寻找政治支持，以便对卡斯特罗的革命政府发动进攻。美国决心不允许像古巴这样的给美洲人民树立勇敢范例的政府存在下去。
    声明谈到艾森豪威尔不久前在马德里同独裁者佛朗哥的会晤时说，“这一会晤充分表明（美国）国务院的陈腐政策，像以往一样，它赤裸裸地支持最残暴的独裁政权和最反动的统治者。”
    声明说：“艾森豪威尔拥抱佛朗哥是给特鲁希略、索摩查和斯特罗斯纳之流的最好的圣诞节礼物。艾森豪威尔的访问本身也是一种干涉我们这些国家内政的形式。”
    新华社27日讯　墨西哥城消息：在墨西哥首都出版的“墨西哥日报”最近发表社论，谴责美国对古巴采取威胁政策。
    社论指出，美国的政策在拉丁美洲引起了恐惧和不安，决不是偶然的。过去，美国的陆军和海军曾经无数次地侵入并占领拉丁美洲国家的领土。社论接着指出，华盛顿对古巴的政策同它想征服和剥削各国人民的传统政策比较起来，实质上并没有变化。社论说，拉丁美洲的人民是美国反对古巴的阴谋的见证人，因为一年多以来美国的宣传家和政治家一直企图干涉这个岛国的内政。
    社论指出，美国为了征服古巴人民，使用了一切可能使用的威胁办法：指责古巴政府是“共产主义”、“横暴”和“血腥”，甚至还诬蔑说“古巴给整个大陆制造了致命的危险”。
