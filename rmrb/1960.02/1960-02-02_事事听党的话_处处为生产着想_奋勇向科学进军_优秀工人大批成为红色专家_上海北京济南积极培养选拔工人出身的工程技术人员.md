Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 1st: An engineering and technical force originating from workers in Shanghai has grown under the Party's nurturing. According to statistics from the industrial, capital construction, transportation, and public utility systems, more than 12,400 workers have been trained as engineering and technical personnel, of whom 133 have been promoted to engineers and 1,679 to assistant engineers.

This engineering and technical force, both red and expert, is rich in production experience and possesses a certain level of cultural and scientific knowledge, especially the noble qualities and vigorous revolutionary spirit of the working class, daring to think and act in the implementation of the General Line. In recent years, many cutting-edge product designs, trial productions, and research projects in Shanghai's engineering and technology circles have been completed by them. Shou Kuifu, a precision grinding machine designer at the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, was a janitor before Liberation. After Liberation, he participated in industrial production, and under the Party's cultivation and education, his professional and ideological levels continuously improved. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, he was appointed as the chief designer of a new type of universal screw grinding machine. The parts processed by this grinding machine had a tolerance of only one-thirtieth of a hair's breadth, and the design task had to be completed in three months. At that time, he had already entered amateur university from amateur primary school and studied Russian, mathematics, mechanics, and electricity. After several years of design work, he worked hard with other designers and workers for more than two months and finally completed the task ahead of schedule. Zheng Fuyou, the chief mechanic of the Xinhu Iron and Steel Plant, who came from a worker background, mastered the new technology of "hot-rolled gears" using simple, indigenous methods, increasing efficiency eighty to one hundred times compared to machining. Zhang Xigen, who was promoted from worker to technical assistant to the factory director of the Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory, is now able to read Soviet technical publications and has begun to master the manufacturing technology of large-scale and advanced mining machinery due to diligent study. Once, the factory had to manufacture a two-ton cutting crusher because other factories had not succeeded in manufacturing such machines in the past. Some technicians in the factory also felt that there was no way to manufacture it. However, Zhang Xigen was not discouraged. He went to the science and technology library to look up information, consulted with workers and engineers, and finally overcame various technical difficulties and made the machine.

Many of these engineering and technical personnel from worker backgrounds originally had low levels of education, and some were even illiterate. However, they have a strong desire to quickly change our country's "poor and blank" situation. Under the Party's training and education, they studied hard and made rapid progress. Liu Ajiu, who has fifty-one years of work experience and participated in the "May 30th" revolutionary struggle, was originally illiterate. Because he studied hard under the Party's cultivation, he has not only systematically studied scientific and technical knowledge in recent years, but also actively studied Chairman Mao's works and some theoretical articles in Party publications, and his political and professional levels have improved rapidly. He is now the deputy director of the mechanical department and electrical engineer of the No. 9 State Cotton Mill. Ru Gongchao, a member of the Communist Youth League and a designer at the Shanghai Electric Welding Machine Factory, has been studying at an evening school since 1953. For several years, he finally mastered the design technology, and has now designed many new electric welding machines.

After Shanghai's liberation, Party organizations at all levels, on the one hand, brought into play the strength of the original engineering and technical personnel and helped them carry out ideological transformation, and on the other hand, actively trained engineering and technical personnel from among the workers. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, factories and enterprises have adopted the method of vigorously running amateur education to train technical personnel from worker backgrounds, thus enabling a large number of engineering and technical personnel from worker backgrounds to grow up.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st: A group of engineering and technical personnel who have grown up from workers in factories and mines in the capital are increasingly playing a significant role in production and technological innovation.

About a quarter of the more than 50,000 middle-level and above cadres in factories and mines in the capital are from worker backgrounds. Some workers who were illiterate at the time of liberation have, through the Party's training and education, now served as workshop directors, technicians, engineers, and even factory directors and chief engineers. At present, there are more than 320 people in the city's factories and mines who have been promoted from workers to factory directors, deputy factory directors, and branch factory directors. According to incomplete statistics, workers account for more than 66% of the 255 technicians in the city's factories and mines. The vast majority of these technicians, engineers, and factory directors work in important technical positions and have become the backbone of resolutely implementing the Party's policies and lines on the production front.

The greatest characteristic of these engineering and technical personnel from worker backgrounds is that they listen to the Party in everything, go wherever the Party points, advance in the face of difficulties, and never give up until the task is completed. Lu Kunlin, a second-level engineer in the repair workshop of the Beijing Building Materials Machinery Manufacturing Factory, is an old worker with more than 30 years of work experience. During the Great Steel Smelting campaign in 1958, he resolutely responded to the Party's call and led the workers to work hard by the small indigenous furnace for four days and five nights, finally laying the foundation for the current sand turning workshop. Last spring, when the Great Hall of the People was under intense construction, the axle of the overhead crane that hoisted the giant steel beams broke in a few days, greatly affecting the construction progress. Lu Kunlin and the workers jointly proposed the innovation of modifying the axle, boldly experimented under the Party's encouragement, and solved the key problem of modifying the axle in only one day and one night.

Humility, simplicity, selflessness, and diligent study are other characteristics of these red experts. After ten years of liberation, Du Baoliang, the deputy director of the electrical machinery factory of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, grew from a worker with only primary school education to an electrical machinery expert in the whole factory, solving problems that some engineers could not solve. However, Du Baoliang is still very humble. Although he is very busy with his work, he still teaches technical classes to cadres and patiently tutors workers regardless of wind or rain. Pan Chunshan, a worker-born hot blast stove technician from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company's Iron Smelting Plant, recently co-wrote the technical theory book "Hot Blast Operation" with engineer Xie Maochun. However, Pan Chunshan always felt that he had not helped the workers enough, so he specially made a question and answer booklet and hung it next to many blast furnaces so that the workers could ask questions at any time. He went to the site every day to answer them, never tired of answering questions.

Setting high aspirations, embracing great ambitions, and vowing to climb the peak of science and technology for the cause of socialism and communism is also the common style of these worker-born technical personnel. Xue Zhen, the factory director and chief power engineer of the power branch of the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory, who was originally a lathe worker, was transferred to this factory four years ago and was not familiar with anything. However, he humbly sought advice from veteran workers, engineers, and Soviet experts, studied technical theory hard one and a half hours earlier than others every day, often participated in production labor in the workshop, and insisted on two hours of political theory study in the evening. Now Xue Zhen has mastered the basic knowledge of various gas manufacturing in the power branch and has become a student of night university. Under his leadership, this factory, which is most prone to accidents, has maintained safe production for several years. Wu Zhudong, the chief engineer of the tool parts branch of this factory, who was originally a worker, only attended elementary school for more than a year. From 1946 to now, he has insisted on amateur cultural and technical study for more than ten years, and is now a sophomore in the mechanical manufacturing major of night university. In recent years, Wu Zhudong has studied hundreds of technical books and learned Russian and German, able to independently draw and help engineers modify technical designs, becoming a model for amateur study for workers throughout the factory.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 1st: In the past year, factories and mines in Jinan City have selected more than 100 engineers from worker backgrounds, of whom 30 have grown up since liberation.

Under the Party's cultivation and education, the political awareness and cultural and scientific and technical levels of this group of engineers from worker backgrounds have been greatly improved in recent years. The average length of service of the 30 engineers from worker backgrounds who have grown up since liberation is more than 22 years, of whom 21 are Communist Party members. In the past, most of them were illiterate, semi-illiterate, or had only attended primary school for three or five years. In order to train this group of engineers, Party organizations in various factories and mines have carried out a series of training work. In addition to strengthening their political and ideological education, the Shandong Paper Mill, Jinan No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, Jinan Locomotive Factory, and Shandong Alcohol Main Factory have helped technical personnel from worker backgrounds improve their cultural and technical levels by organizing staff with higher cultural levels to lead technical personnel from worker backgrounds to study practical problems, sending them to visit other factories, and linking them with colleges and universities.

These engineers from worker backgrounds are all well-known advanced producers who dare to think and act. Wang Xuerui, who has 28 years of work experience, had a very low level of education before liberation. After liberation, under the Party's care and training, his cultural and technical level has greatly improved. He successfully trial-produced a wheat peeling machine, which greatly improved production efficiency and saved a lot of wealth for the country. Xi Liyuan, an engineer in the smelting workshop of the Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory, with the help of the masses, innovated tools and promoted more than 50 advanced experiences last year, improving the efficiency of all aspects of iron smelting, enabling the workshop to save 269 people to support other aspects of production. After the young worker Wang Changxin was selected as an engineer, he successfully tested wide-knife precision planing, wide-blade precision planing, and one-bar double-blade three innovations this year, increasing production efficiency by 60% to one time.

    事事听党的话　处处为生产着想　奋勇向科学进军
    优秀工人大批成为红色专家
    上海北京济南积极培养选拔工人出身的工程技术人员
    新华社上海1日电　上海市工人出身的一支工程技术队伍，已经在党的培养下成长起来。据工业、基本建设、交通运输、公用事业四个系统的统计，已有一万二千四百多位工人被培养成为工程技术人员，其中被提拔担任工程师的有一百三十三人，助理工程师有一千六百七十九人。
    这支又红又专的工程技术队伍，既富有生产经验，又有一定的文化与科学技术知识，特别是具有工人阶级的崇高品质和旺盛的革命斗志，在贯彻总路线中敢想敢做。近几年来上海工程技术界许多尖端产品的设计、试制、研究项目，有不少都是由他们完成的。上海机床厂的精密磨床设计师寿奎富，解放前是一名扫地的勤杂工。解放后参加工业生产，在党的培养教育下，业务水平和思想水平不断提高。1958年大跃进中，他被任命为一种新型万能螺丝磨床的主任设计师。这种磨床加工出来的零件，公差只有一根头发丝的三十分之一，而且要在三个月中完成设计任务。当时，他已经从业余小学进入业余大学，学习了俄文、数学、力学、电学等知识，担任了几年设计工作了，经过和其他设计人员、工人一起苦战两个多月，终于提前完成了这项任务。新沪钢铁厂工人出身的总机械师郑富有，用简单的土办法掌握了“热轧齿轮”这一新技术，比用切削法加工这种齿轮提高效率八十倍到一百倍。从工人提拔为上海矿山机器厂厂长技术助理的张锡根，由于刻苦学习，现在已能阅读苏联的技术刊物，开始掌握了大型和尖端的矿山机械制造技术。有一次，厂里要制造一个两吨切削破碎机，因为别的工厂过去制造这种机器没有成功。厂里有些技术人员也认为没有办法制造。但是，张锡根并不气馁，他跑到科技图书馆去翻资料，找工人和工程师商量，终于克服了种种技术困难，制成了这部机器。
    这些工人出身的工程技术人员中，许多人原来文化水平很低，有的还是文盲。但是他们有着强烈的迅速改变我国“一穷二白”的愿望，在党的培养、教育下，刻苦钻研，进步很快。有五十一年工龄、参加过“五卅”革命斗争的刘阿九原来是文盲，由于他在党的培养下刻苦钻研，几年来，不但系统地学习了科学技术知识，还积极地学习了毛主席的著作和党刊上的一些理论文章，政治、业务水平提高很快。现在担任了国棉九厂机械部副主任和电气工程师工作。共青团员、上海电焊机厂的设计员茹公超，1953年以来在业余学校学习，几年如一日，他终于熟练地掌握了设计技术，现在已经设计出许多种新的电焊机。
    上海解放后，各级党组织一面发挥原有工程技术人员的力量并帮助他们进行思想改造，一面积极从工人中培养工程技术人员。1958年大跃进以来，各工厂企业更采取大规模地举办业余教育的方法培养工人出身的技术人员，从而使工人出身的工程技术人员大批成长起来。
    新华社1日讯　首都各厂矿企业从工人中成长起来的一批工程技术人员，在生产和技术革新中日益发挥着显著的作用。
    首都各厂矿、企业五万多名中级以上干部中，约有四分之一是工人出身。有些在解放时还不识字的工人，经过党的培养、教育，如今已经担任车间主任、技术员、技师以至厂长和总工程师工作。目前全市厂矿、企业中由工人提拔为厂长、副厂长、分厂长的已有三百二十多人。据不完全统计，在市属厂矿企业的二百五十五名技师中，工人出身的就占66％强。这批技师、工程师、厂长，绝大部分在重要的技术岗位工作，成为生产战线上坚决执行党的政策路线的骨干。
    这些工人出身的工程技术人员的最大特色是：事事听党的话，党指到哪里就干到哪里，知难而进，不完成任务不收兵。北京建筑材料机器制造厂修配车间的二级工程师陆坤林，是有三十多年工龄的老工人。1958年大炼钢铁时，他坚决响应党的号召，带领工人在小土炉旁苦战四天五夜，终于给现在的翻砂车间奠定了基础。去年春天，人民大会堂紧张施工时，吊运巨型钢梁的天车车轴用几天就断了，大大影响施工进度。陆坤林又同工人一起提出了改装车轴的创议，在党的鼓舞下大胆实验，只用一天一夜的时间就解决了改装车轴的关键问题。
    谦虚朴素、大公无私、学习刻苦，是这些红色专家的另一特色。石景山钢铁公司电机厂副厂长杜宝良解放十年后，从一个只有小学文化水平的工人成长为全厂的电机专家，解决了有些工程师不能解决的问题。但是杜宝良仍然很谦虚，他虽然工作很忙，还风雨不误地给干部上技术课，耐心辅导工人。石景山钢铁公司炼铁厂工人出身的热风炉技师潘春山，不久以前同工程师谢茂春合写了技术理论书籍“热风操作”，但是，潘春山总是觉得自己对工人的帮助太少，就专门做了问题解答册挂在许多高炉旁，使工人能随时提问题，他每天都到现场去解答，做到百问不厌。
    立大志，抱雄心，为了社会主义、共产主义事业誓攀科学技术高峰，也是这些工人出身的技术人员的共同风格。北京电子管厂动力分厂车工出身的厂长兼总动力师薛镇，四年前被调到这个厂工作时，一切都不熟悉。但是，他向老工人、工程师、苏联专家虚心求教，每天比旁人早上班一个半小时苦钻技术理论，经常到车间参加生产劳动，晚间还坚持两小时政治理论学习。如今薛镇已经掌握了动力分厂各种气体制造的基本知识，并且成为夜大学的学生。几年来这个最容易出事故的工厂在他的领导下，一直保持安全生产。这个厂工具零件分厂工人出身的总工程师吴柱东，原来只上过一年多小学。从1946年到现在，他十多年如一日地坚持业余文化、技术学习，现在是夜大学机械制造专业二年级的学生。几年来，吴柱东研读了几百种技术书籍，并且学会了俄文和德文，能够独立制图和帮助工程师修改技术设计，成为全厂工人业余学习的榜样。
    新华社济南1日电　济南市各厂矿企业在过去一年中，选拔了一百多名工人出身的工程师，其中有三十名是解放后成长起来的。
    这批工人出身的工程师，几年来在党的培养、教育下，政治觉悟和文化、科学技术水平都有很大提高。解放后成长起来的三十名工人出身的工程师，平均工龄在二十二年以上，其中有二十一人是共产党员。过去，他们多半是文盲、半文盲，或者只上过三、五年小学。为了培养这批工程师，各厂矿企业党组织进行了一系列的培养工作。除了加强他们的政治思想教育外，山东造纸总厂、济南第一机床厂、济南机车工厂、山东酒精总厂等单位，都通过组织文化水平较高的工作人员带领工人出身的技术人员研究实际问题，派他们到外厂参观，与大专学校挂钩等办法，帮助工人出身的技术人员提高文化技术水平。
    这些工人出身的工程师都是敢想敢干的著名先进生产者。有二十八年工龄的王学锐，解放前文化水平很低，解放后在党的关心和培养下，文化、技术水平有很大提高，试制成功了小麦脱皮机，大大提高了生产效率，为国家节约了大量财富。济南印染厂冶炼车间工程师席利元在群众的帮助下，去年革新工具和推广先进经验五十多项，提高了炼铁各个环节的工效，使车间节约出二百六十九人支援其他环节生产。青年工人王长信被选拔为工程师以后，今年又试验成功了宽刀精刨、宽刃精刨，一杆双刃三项革新，提高生产效率60％到一倍。
