Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 22nd - Following half a month of frequent negotiations between the Indian National Congress High Command and leaders of the People's Socialist Party and the Muslim League, the Kerala state government was formally established today in the capital, Trivandrum. The new state government has been sworn in.

The state government is a coalition consisting of eight members from the National Congress and three members from the People's Socialist Party. The Chief Minister is P.T. Pillai, leader of the People's Socialist Party. Sources say that the National Congress relinquished the Chief Minister position because it needed to maintain the alliance to counter the Communist Party.

    印度国大党和人民社会党组成喀拉拉邦联合政府
    据新华社新德里22日电　在国大党最高司令部同人民社会党和穆斯林联盟领袖之间举行了为时半个月的频繁的谈判以后，喀拉拉邦政府今天在首府特里凡得琅正式成立。新的邦政府已经宣誓就职。
    这个邦政府是由八名国大党人和三名人民社会党人组成的联合政府，首席部长由人民社会党领袖帕·塔·皮莱担任。有消息说，国大党所以放弃这个首席部长职位是因为它需要保持联盟来对付共产党。
