Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 21st -- More than 1,000 returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of Overseas Chinese, and Overseas Chinese students in Guangzhou held a rally on the evening of the 20th to warmly welcome the more than 900 returned Overseas Chinese who returned to the embrace of the motherland on the 18th. Overseas Chinese who had just returned from Indonesia exposed at the meeting the various unreasonable and barbaric actions of influential groups in Indonesia in obstructing Overseas Chinese from returning to China and harassing Overseas Chinese.

Zhong Qingfa, director of the General Office of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and负责人 of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of Guangdong Province attended the welcome meeting.

Fu Rongding, deputy director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of Guangdong Province, spoke at the meeting, expressing a warm welcome to the Overseas Chinese who returned to the country to participate in socialist construction. He said, "We are very happy to see you return safely to the great motherland." Then, he condemned the unreasonable behavior of influential groups in Indonesia in obstructing Overseas Chinese from returning to China. He said that certain influential groups in Indonesia have taken unreasonable measures to obstruct and harass our Overseas Chinese in every possible way, intercept private property of Overseas Chinese, conduct insulting body searches, and even repeatedly detain and sentence our returning Overseas Chinese. After the motherland's ship transporting Overseas Chinese arrived in Jakarta, many Overseas Chinese were subjected to various harassments and restrictions, making it difficult for them to gather smoothly at the port to board the ship and return home. He said that we express our indignation at the extremely unfriendly behavior of influential groups in Indonesia in adopting such unreasonable and barbaric actions.

Then, Overseas Chinese returning from Indonesia spoke on the stage one after another. They expressed their gratitude for the motherland's deep concern, saying that the motherland and Overseas Chinese are linked heart to heart, and any attempt to persecute Overseas Chinese and their actions will ultimately be defeated.

The returning Overseas Chinese also cited various facts to expose and accuse the unreasonable behavior of influential groups in Indonesia in obstructing Overseas Chinese from returning to China and harassing Overseas Chinese. Xu Qing, an old miner who returned from Bangka Island in Indonesia, said that influential groups in Indonesia made things difficult for returning Overseas Chinese in every possible way, prohibiting them from bringing this or that back, and even opening the soles of the returning Overseas Chinese's leather shoes and some female Overseas Chinese's hair buns for inspection. Xu Qing said that he had never seen such unreasonable behavior.

An Overseas Chinese who had lived in Bangka for generations said that more than 500 Overseas Chinese from various parts of Bangka returned to the motherland via Bangka this time, and they were waiting on Bangka Island on January 31st to board the ship back home. It took nine days just to check the luggage there. During the luggage inspection, many difficulties were made, and many people were not allowed to bring back even canned food, leather shoes, and soap. This Overseas Chinese excitedly said that Overseas Chinese have paid a lot of blood and sweat in their places of residence and made contributions to Indonesia's economic development. Now, they want to bring their hard-earned savings back to the motherland, but they are subjected to such unreasonable obstruction and harassment, which makes us all very angry.

Overseas Chinese students from Surabaya complained one after another that more than 20 of them could only bring back some of the simplest things, and many people could not even bring back pillows and mats. Some people were only allowed to bring back two or three sets of clothes and could not keep warm. Fortunately, when they arrived in Shenzhen, the reception staff gave them new cotton-padded clothes. Before boarding the ship in Surabaya, they were subjected to various harassments by the inspectors. Among these inspectors were armed army, military police, and police, as well as prosecutors and customs officers, as if they were facing a formidable enemy. The returning Overseas Chinese students took out various items they had just brought back and angrily exposed the Indonesian inspectors' rude behavior towards Overseas Chinese; these items were soap cut into small pieces, leather shoes pierced with knives, and thermos bottles smashed into pieces of glass. Some inspectors also took away the belongings of returning Overseas Chinese under various pretexts. A watch brought by Chen Jiqiang, an Overseas Chinese student, was inspected by an army military police officer, who said the movement was new and took it away. A Surabaya Overseas Chinese student surnamed Li had his mosquito net, coat, socks, soap, toothbrush, comb, and bath towel taken away by the inspectors. The returning Overseas Chinese said that the deliberate obstruction and open seizure of property by influential groups in Indonesia cannot shake their determination to return to the motherland, because the powerful motherland is the backing of Overseas Chinese.

The returning Overseas Chinese also revealed that some official inspectors in Surabaya openly said words slandering New China many times when inspecting luggage before the Overseas Chinese boarded the ship. Many returning Overseas Chinese female students revealed that Indonesian inspectors took the opportunity of inspecting luggage to conduct personal insults against them. The inspectors also forced the female students to smile at them under the pretext of not inspecting their luggage. Some female students' photos were also taken away by the inspectors.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 20th -- Another group of more than 500 Overseas Chinese from West Java left here today on the "Da Baokang" ship to return to their motherland. "Da Baokang" is one of the first four ships sent by the Chinese government to Indonesia to transport Overseas Chinese back to China.

When this group of returning Overseas Chinese left Tanjung Priok Port in Jakarta, Huang Zhen, the Chinese ambassador to Indonesia, and his wife, Wu Zhizhi, the Chinese representative of the China-Indonesia Joint Committee for the implementation of the Dual Nationality Treaty, and personnel from the Chinese Embassy and the Consulate General in Jakarta were all at the dock to see them off.

The people who saw them off on the shore wished the returning Overseas Chinese "a safe journey," and the returning Overseas Chinese excitedly and gratefully shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!"

So far, among the first four ships sent by the Chinese government to Indonesia to transport Overseas Chinese back to China, three have already set sail with a total of more than 1,500 Overseas Chinese who were displaced in the anti-Chinese activities in West Java. Today, another group of more than 300 returning Overseas Chinese boarded the fourth ship, the "Haihuang," which is still waiting in Jakarta Port because its passenger capacity is not full.

So far, all the Overseas Chinese who had gathered in Jakarta and had been persecuted in West Java have boarded the ship, and most of them are already on their way back to China. After boarding the ship, the returning Overseas Chinese were warmly received by all the staff sent by the motherland to pick them up.

    广州集会热烈欢迎归国侨胞
    揭露印度尼西亚有势力集团阻挠华侨回国和刁难华侨的行为
    又一批华侨五百多人在雅加达登上祖国接运轮船启程回国
    新华社广州21日电　广州市归国华侨、侨眷和华侨学生一千多人在20日晚上集会，热烈欢迎18日回到祖国怀抱的九百多名归国侨胞。刚从印度尼西亚回国的侨胞，在会上揭露了印度尼西亚有势力集团阻挠华侨回国和刁难华侨的各种横蛮无理的行为。
    出席欢迎会的，有华侨事务委员会办公厅主任钟庆发和广东省华侨事务委员会的负责人。
    广东省华侨事务委员会副主任符荣鼎在会上讲话，对侨胞回国参加社会主义建设表示热烈欢迎。他说，我们见到你们平安地回到伟大的祖国来，感到十分高兴。接着，他谴责了印度尼西亚有势力集团阻挠华侨回国的无理行为。他说，印度尼西亚某些有势力的集团，采取无理措施，百般阻挠、刁难我国侨胞回国，截留华侨私人财物，进行侮辱人身的搜查，甚至连续发生拘禁我归国侨胞并予以判刑的事件。祖国接运华侨轮船到达雅加达之后，又有许多华侨受到诸多刁难和限制，使他们不能顺利集合到港口登船回国。他说，印度尼西亚有势力集团采取此种横蛮无理的极不友好的行为，我们对此表示愤慨。
    接着，印度尼西亚的归国华侨一个接着一个上台讲话。他们对祖国的深切关怀表示感谢，他们说，祖国和华侨是心连着心的，对华侨的任何迫害企图和行为，最后都一定要遭到失败。
    归国华侨还举出各种事实，揭露和控诉了印度尼西亚有势力集团阻挠华侨回国和刁难华侨的无理行为。从印度尼西亚汶岛归来的老矿工许青说，印度尼西亚有势力集团百般刁难归侨，这也不准带回，那也不准带回，连归侨的皮鞋底以及一些女侨胞的发髻都被打开来检查。许青说，他从来没有见过这种无理的行为。
    一位在汶岛数代侨居的归侨说，这次从邦加各地经汶岛回祖国的侨胞共有五百多人，1月31日就在汶岛候船回国。在那里检查行李就花了九天时间。在检查行李时诸多为难，有很多人连罐头、皮鞋和肥皂都没有被准许带回。这位归侨激动地说，华侨在侨居地付出了大量的血汗，为印度尼西亚的经济发展作出了贡献。现在想把自己的辛勤积蓄带回祖国来，却受到这样无理的阻挠和刁难，我们都感到十分愤怒。
    来自泗水的华侨学生纷纷诉说，他们二十多人都只能携带一些最简单的东西回来，许多人连枕头和席子都没有能带回。有些人只被准许带回二、三套衣服，无法御寒，好在到深圳时，接待人员给他们穿上了新棉衣。他们在泗水上船前，遭到检查人员的多方刁难。这些检查人员中，有武装的陆军、宪兵和警察，以及检察官、海关人员等，就像如临大敌一样。归国华侨学生们拿出刚带回来的各种物品，气愤地揭露印度尼西亚检查人员对华侨的粗暴行为；这些物品是被切成小块的香皂，被刀子戳破了的皮鞋，还有被捣成碎玻璃片的热水瓶。一些检查人员还利用各种借口拿走归侨的物品。华侨学生陈季强带的一只手表，受到一个陆军宪兵的检查，说机件是新的，就拿走了。一个姓李的泗水华侨学生，被检查人员拿走的物品有蚊帐、大衣、袜子、肥皂、牙刷、梳子和浴巾等。归侨们说，印度尼西亚有势力集团的蓄意阻挠和公然夺取财物，并不能动摇他们返回祖国的决心，因为强大的祖国是海外侨胞的靠山。
    归侨们还揭露说，泗水一些官方检查人员在华侨上船前检查行李时，公然多次说了诬蔑新中国的话。许多归侨女学生揭露说，印度尼西亚的检查人员利用检查行李的机会，对她们进行了人身侮辱。检查人员还以不检查行李为要挟，强迫女学生向他们微笑。有的女学生的照片也被检查人员拿走了。
    新华社雅加达20日电　另一批来自西爪哇的五百多名华侨今天乘“大宝康号”轮船离开这里回祖国去。“大宝康号”是中国政府派到印度尼西亚来接运华侨回国的第一批四艘轮船中的一艘。
    在这批归国华侨离开雅加达的丹绒不碌港的时候，中国驻印度尼西亚大使黄镇和他的夫人，为实施双重国籍问题条约的中国—印度尼西亚联合委员会的中国代表伍治之，中国大使馆和驻雅加达总领事馆的人员都在码头上欢送他们。
    在岸上送行的人祝归国侨胞“一路平安”，归国华侨兴奋感激地高呼“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”
    到现在为止，在中国政府派到印度尼西亚来接运华侨回国的第一批四艘轮船中，已经有三艘搭载了总共一千五百多名在西爪哇排华活动中流离失所的华侨启碇回国。今天，另一批三百多名归国华侨登上第四艘轮船“海皇号”，由于它的载客名额未满，现在还等在雅加达港。
    到目前为止，在雅加达集中的曾经在西爪哇受到迫害的华侨都已经上船，其中大部分已经在回国途中。归国侨胞在上船后，受到祖国派来的接他们回国的全体工作人员的热情接待。
