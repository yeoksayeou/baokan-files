    Accelerate Literacy Progress and Prevent Relapse into Illiteracy
    Li Ming, First Secretary of the CCP Wanrong County Committee, Shanxi Province
    The phonetic-based literacy campaign carried out in Wanrong County was a product of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction in 1958. The phonetic-based literacy campaign arose to meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, and on the other hand, it promoted a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.
    Wanrong has made great achievements in literacy work over the years. As of October 1958, 33,980 out of the 38,235 illiterate people in the county had become literate. However, because consolidation was not carried out in a timely manner, 12,090 people relapsed into illiteracy. Furthermore, many people, although they had become literate, still had limited literacy skills. They struggled to understand books and had difficulty writing, making reading and writing a challenge. This state of cultural backwardness formed a sharp contradiction with the demands of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production. How to resolve this contradiction was a question we had been pondering. The Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme promulgated by the State Council in 1957 provided us with a powerful tool for completely eliminating illiteracy and rapidly consolidating and expanding literacy achievements.
    One year of experience has proven that phonetic-based literacy is a fast, efficient, and economical literacy method. In our county, farmers can generally learn the phonetic alphabet in 15 to 20 hours, which is equivalent to finding the key to unlocking every Chinese character. Then, after about 100 hours, they can recognize 1,500 Chinese characters. After becoming literate, they can continue to use this key to rapidly consolidate and expand literacy achievements, and improve their political awareness and cultural level through extensive reading of phonetic-based reading materials. This fundamentally solves the problem of consolidation and improvement after becoming literate, and eliminates the possibility of relapse into illiteracy. Therefore, phonetic-based literacy has been enthusiastically welcomed by the masses. At the same time, the promotion of Mandarin is naturally achieved through phonetic-based literacy. As female commune member Cheng Shuqian aptly put it, "The Chinese phonetic alphabet is a good method, blooming two flowers from one tree: one flower removes the illiteracy cap, and the other learns Mandarin."
    Wanrong's phonetic-based literacy work has achieved relatively significant results in the past year. All 13,246 illiterate people in the county (including relapsed and remaining illiterate people) have now become literate, achieving the goal of a youth and middle-aged illiterate-free county ahead of schedule. 24,163 elderly illiterate people over the age of 40 have also participated in learning, of which more than 240 have become literate, and 9,334 have learned the phonetic alphabet and are now using the alphabet to further master Chinese characters. Out of the 210,000 people in the county, 144,000 have joined the upsurge of learning the Chinese phonetic alphabet and Mandarin. According to statistics, 104,925 people have learned the Chinese phonetic alphabet, and 107,000 people can speak Mandarin, of which 39,000 primary and secondary school teachers and students, as well as 3,400 cadres and staff and most young people, speak it relatively well.
    With the development of the phonetic-based literacy campaign, a comprehensive leap forward situation has emerged on the county's cultural revolution front. After becoming literate, the broad masses of working people eagerly read phonetic-based reading materials and create a large number of poems to praise the new life of the socialist Great Leap Forward. From late November to late December 1959 alone, more than 180,000 copies of phonetic-based reading materials were sold in our county, and another 240,000 copies were pre-ordered, which still could not meet the needs of the masses. For the first time in history, a phenomenon appeared where the broad masses of farmers rushed to bookstores to buy reading materials. The "Wanrong Pinyin News" (typeset, 4-page, 4-section, semi-monthly) edited and published by the county, has a circulation of more than 9,000 copies per issue, averaging more than one copy for every five households. The poems and quick clappers created by farmers amounted to more than 1.2 million. After phonetic-based literacy, illiterate people in Qinggu Village generally read forty or fifty phonetic-based popular reading materials. After reading the booklet "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains," old man Li Taibai issued the heroic declaration of "competing with the Foolish Old Man," increasing the amount of manure he delivered daily from 1,000 catties to 3,000 catties. Young farmer Cheng Kuanniu, who came from three generations of illiteracy, was called "Mèn Kuài" (dull and uninspired). After becoming literate, he read phonetic-based reading materials on agricultural science and technology, as well as newspapers and periodicals containing agricultural high-yield experience. Although his experimental cotton and sweet potato fields suffered five hailstorms and seventy-five days of severe drought, he still created a record of cotton yield per mu that was twice as high as the local average, and a sweet potato yield per mu that was one time higher. Now, farmer intellectuals, farmer writers, farmer scientists, and knowledgeable rural leading cadres are constantly and abundantly emerging in our county.
    The leap forward on the cultural front, in turn, promoted a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. The county's industry has grown from scratch, and now 96 factories have been established. In agriculture, in 1959, the people of our county overcame seventy-five days of severe drought, five pest infestations, a once-in-a-century flood, and five hailstorms in some areas, and achieved a bumper harvest of cotton, grain, and oil crops. Compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, the grain yield per mu increased by 36.3%, the cotton yield per mu increased by 3.8%, and the oil crop yield per mu increased by 30%. Now, our county has greatly changed the backward and poor face of "nine droughts in ten years" and "not enough to eat and wear" before liberation. The people have deeply felt the benefits of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and wholeheartedly thank the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.
    The achievements we have made in phonetic-based literacy work are inseparable from strengthening the Party's leadership, adhering to putting politics in command, closely integrating with production, and launching a mass movement on a large scale.
    In order to strengthen the Party's leadership over phonetic-based literacy and the promotion of Mandarin, our county has the first secretary in command, the secretary in charge of culture and education, and has established institutions at the county, commune, and management district levels to regularly check, study, and deploy work. At present, from the county to the commune to the district, there is a professional cadre team of more than 230 people who are separated from production and receive subsidies (excluding general subsidized volunteer teachers) to engage in specific guidance.
    Phonetic-based literacy is a new task, and it will inevitably encounter resistance from various conservative ideas and habitual forces, and it will also be met with suspicion from some of the masses at the beginning. Therefore, in the movement, we pay great attention to strengthening the Party's political and ideological work, promoting positive factors, overcoming negative factors, relying on activists, and driving the broad masses. In various meetings, propaganda and education are carried out, and attaching importance to and actively participating in phonetic-based literacy work is regarded as a political inspection standard for whether or not one cares about the interests of the masses and socialist construction. This mobilizes the enthusiasm of the broad masses of Party members, League members, cadres, and the masses, and turns phonetic-based literacy and learning Mandarin into a conscious action of the broad masses.
    Phonetic-based literacy should and can be closely integrated with agricultural production. We have established learning organizations based on the form of production organization. In addition to dividing classes according to proficiency, we also form field learning groups, bedside tutoring groups, and water conservancy construction site learning groups according to the professional teams and work groups in production. We also change the learning methods at any time according to the changes in agricultural seasons and production activities. In addition to regular classes, we advocate bringing a bag (mobile library bag) and four treasures (books, water pens, notebooks, and newspapers) to the fields, so that books are always with them and their minds never forget learning. In addition to formal teaching materials, the content of teaching is supplemented by each management district according to the principle of better serving production, so that what is learned can be used immediately. This enables learning to be combined with production and serve production. Many commune members, after learning, have applied what they have learned to production and created new high-yield records. At the grassroots level, we also advocate that production team leaders should often "manage two things," namely manage production and manage learning; and work group leaders should "manage three things," namely manage production, manage learning, and manage recreational activities. When we check, evaluate, and deploy work, we also check, evaluate, and deploy learning.
    In carrying out phonetic-based literacy work, teachers, teaching materials, and phonetic-based reading materials are issues that the Party committee should attach importance to and resolve. On the issue of teachers, we have adopted the method of "people teach people," and have successively held ten training classes to train 2,000 teachers. At the same time, we have also cultivated 3,500 instructors, and they have cultivated countless active learners, acting as "little teachers" who learn and teach at the same time. We also organized primary and secondary school teachers and students throughout the county to tutor their relatives and friends. In this way, we relied on the wisdom and strength of the masses to solve the problem of teachers. In terms of teaching materials, we have successively compiled and printed more than 20,000 copies of textbooks with phonetic alphabet annotations, and mobilized the masses to compile supplementary teaching materials themselves. In terms of phonetic-based reading materials, in addition to purchasing a batch from Beijing, we founded the "Wanrong Pinyin News" to serve as reading materials. This newspaper is also a garden for publishing mass creations. Thanks to the support of the leadership and the vigorous mobilization of the masses to solve the problems themselves, we have successfully solved the problems of teachers, teaching materials, and reading materials, so that our movement can develop rapidly and healthily.
    In addition, we also pay great attention to creating an environment conducive to promoting phonetic-based literacy and the promotion of Mandarin. Many places have arranged a literacy environment that "surrounds illiteracy with characters," writing the names of agricultural tools in pinyin and Chinese characters on agricultural tools. Slogans, wall poems, and signs of government agencies and schools are all annotated with pinyin. If you make a phone call, you will be greeted with a slogan that says "Please speak Mandarin when making a phone call." This allows the broad masses to be exposed to the phonetic alphabet and Mandarin everywhere, thereby promoting the smooth development of the movement.

    加快扫盲进度  杜绝复盲道路
    中共山西省万荣县委第一书记　李明
    万荣开展的注音扫盲运动，是1958年社会主义建设大跃进的产物。注音扫盲运动适应工农业生产大跃进形势的需要而产生，另一方面它又促进了工农业生产的更大跃进。
    万荣历年来的扫盲工作，成绩很大，至1958年10月为止，全县三万八千二百三十五个文盲中，有三万三千九百八十人脱了盲。但因没能及时巩固，一万二千零九十人回生复盲；还有许多人，虽然已经脱盲，但毕竟识字有限，展书打不退“虎”，提笔写不成文，阅读和写作都有困难。这种文化上的落后状况，同工农业生产大跃进的要求之间，形成了一个尖锐的矛盾。怎样解决这个矛盾，是我们一直思索的问题。1957年国务院公布的汉语拼音方案，给我们提供了彻底扫除文盲、迅速巩固和扩大扫盲成果的有力工具。
    一年来的经验证明：注音扫盲是个多快好省的扫盲方法。我县农民一般经过十五至二十个小时的学习，就可以学会拼音字母，这就等于找到了打开每个汉字之门的钥匙。然后经过一百个小时左右的时间，就能认识一千五百个汉字。脱盲之后，继续利用这把钥匙，通过大量阅读注音读物，迅速巩固和扩大扫盲成果，并提高政治觉悟和文化水平。这样就根本解决了脱盲后的巩固提高问题，杜绝了回生复盲的可能。因此注音扫盲受到广大群众的热烈欢迎。同时，通过注音扫盲自然也就推广了普通话，女社员程淑欠说得好：“汉语拼音好办法，一树开下两朵花：一朵摘掉了文盲帽，一朵学会了普通话。”
    万荣的注音扫盲工作，一年来已经取得了比较显著的成绩。全县一万三千二百四十六个文盲（包括复盲和剩余文盲），现在已经全部脱盲，提前实现了青壮年无盲县。四十岁以上的老年文盲二万四千一百六十三人也参加了学习，其中有二百四十余人已经脱盲，有九千三百三十四人学会了拼音字母，现在正在利用字母进一步掌握汉字。全县二十一万人中，有十四万四千人卷入了学习汉语拼音字母和普通话的热潮。据统计，现在有十万零四千九百二十五人学会了汉语拼音字母，有十万零七千人可以说普通话，其中三万九千个中小学师生以及三千四百个干部职工和大部分青年人说得较好。
    随着注音扫盲运动的开展，全县的文化革命战线上出现了全面大跃进的形势。广大劳动群众在脱盲以后，如饥似渴地阅读注音读物，并大量创作诗歌，歌颂社会主义大跃进的新生活。1959年11月下旬到12月下旬，仅注音读物一项，在我县就销行了十八万多册，同时还预购了二十四万册，仍不能满足群众需要。历史上第一次出现了广大农民到书店争购读物的现象。由县编辑出版的“万荣拼音报”（铅印，4开4版，旬刊），每期发行九千多份，平均五户多就有一份。农民创作的诗歌、快板，约计有一百二十余万首。青谷村的文盲，经过注音扫盲以后，每人一般阅读注音的通俗读物四、五十本。李太白老汉，读了“愚公移山”的小册子后，发出了“赛愚公”的豪言，由平日送粪一千斤增加到三千斤。青年农民程宽牛，三辈子文盲，人们称他“闷块”（愚笨不开窍），脱盲以后，由于阅读了关于农业科学技术方面的注音读物，以及载有农业丰产经验的报刊，他种的棉花和红薯试验田，虽然遭受五次雹灾和七十五天大旱，仍然创造了棉花平均亩产量高出当地两倍、红薯亩产量高出一倍的记录。现在，农民知识分子、农民作家、农民科学家、知识化了的农村领导干部，正在我县不断地、大量地涌现。
    文化战线上的跃进，反转来又推动了工农业生产的更大跃进。全县工业从无到有，现在已经办起工厂九十六座。在农业方面，1959年我县人民战胜了七十五天的大旱，五次虫灾，百年未遇的洪水，以及部分地区的五次雹灾，夺得了棉、粮、油料的大丰收。同大跃进的1958年比较，粮食亩产量增长了36．3％，棉花亩产量增长了3．8％，油料亩产量增长30％。现在我县已大大改变了解放前“十年九旱”，“吃不饱，穿不暖”的落后贫穷面貌，人民群众从心底深处体会到总路线、大跃进、人民公社的好处，衷心感谢共产党和毛主席的英明领导。
    我们在注音扫盲工作方面取得的成就，是跟加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，紧密结合生产，大搞群众运动分不开的。
    为了加强党对注音扫盲和推广普通话的领导，我县由第一书记挂帅，文教书记负责，并在县、公社、管理区层层设立机构，定期检查研究布置工作。目前，从县到社到区，有一支二百三十余人的脱离生产和受补贴的专业干部队伍（不包括一般受补贴的义务教师），从事具体指导。
    注音扫盲是一项新的工作，一定会遇到各种保守思想和习惯势力的反抗，开始时也会受到一部分群众的怀疑。因此，我们在运动中十分注意加强党的政治思想工作，发扬积极因素，克服消极因素，依靠积极分子，带动广大群众。在各种会议上，进行宣传教育，把重视和积极参加注音扫盲工作，当作是否关心群众利益和社会主义建设的一个政治检查标准。这就动员了广大党、团员、干部和群众的积极性，使注音扫盲和学习普通话，变成广大群众的自觉行动。
    注音扫盲应该而且也能够紧密结合农业生产。我们根据生产组织形式建立了学习组织，除了按程度划分班级以外，还按照生产中的专业队和作业组，分别编成地头学习组、炕头包教组、水利工地学习组，我们还根据农事季节的转换，生产活动形式的改变，随时改变学习方式，平时除定时上课以外，我们提倡下地带一包（流动图书包）、四宝（书、水笔、抄写本、报纸），作到书不离身，心不忘学。教学内容，除正式教材外，各管理区还按照更好地为生产服务的原则，编写补充教材，作到学了马上就能用。这样就做到学习结合了生产，服务于生产。不少社员，经过学习后，把学的应用到生产中去，创造了丰产新纪录。在基层，我们还提倡生产队长要经常“两管”，既管生产，又管学习；作业组长要“三管”，就是管生产、管学习、管文娱活动。我们在检查评比布置工作时，同时检查评比布置学习。
    在进行注音扫盲工作中，师资、教材以及注音读物，是党委应该重视解决的问题，在师资问题上，我们采取了“民教民”的办法，先后举办了十次训练班，培训了二千名教师，同时还培养出三千五百名辅导员，并由他们培养了无数学习积极的学员，充当边学边教的“小先生”，还组织全县中小学师生包教其亲友，我们就这样依靠群众的智慧和力量解决了师资的问题。在教材方面，我们先后编印了二万余册注有拼音字母的教本，并发动群众自编补充教材。在注音读物方面，除向北京购买一批外，我们创办了“万荣拼音报”，充当读物。这个报纸又是发表群众创作的园地。由于领导的支持和大力发动群众自己解决，我们顺利地解决了师资、教材和读物问题，从而使我们的运动能够迅速而健康地发展下去。
    此外，我们还十分注意造成有利于推行注音扫盲和推广普通话的环境，不少地方都布置了使“文字包围文盲”的识字环境，在农具上用拼音和汉字写上这个农具的名称。标语、墙头诗歌、机关学校的牌子，都加上注音，如果你打电话，就会迎头看到一幅写着“打电话请说普通话”的标语。这就使广大群众处处受到拼音字母和普通话的熏染，从而促进了运动的顺利开展。
