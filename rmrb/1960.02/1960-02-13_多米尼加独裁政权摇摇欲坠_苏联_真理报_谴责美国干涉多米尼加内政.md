    Dominican Dictatorship Totters
    Soviet "Pravda" Condemns U.S. Interference in Dominican Internal Affairs
    Xinhua News Agency, February 12th – The flames of the Dominican people's struggle against the Trujillo dictatorship continue to burn ever higher. According to Venezuelan intelligence sources on February 10th, three more clashes between demonstrating masses and the dictatorship's military police have occurred in the Dominican Republic in the past two weeks, resulting in at least sixty-three deaths and seventy injuries. In the streets and parks of the Dominican capital, youth and students, undeterred by military police repression, held up signs that read "Down with Trujillo" and staged demonstrations. On February 4th, Dominican patriots distributed 250,000 leaflets in the capital and elsewhere calling for the overthrow of the dictatorship. According to diplomatic sources in Caracas who maintain contact with Dominican exiles, news from the Dominican Republic indicates that the Trujillo dictatorship could collapse at any moment under popular resistance.
    American experts in Washington recently acknowledged, when assessing the situation in the Dominican Republic, that the Trujillo regime is facing "the most powerful resistance in more than thirty years." A "New York Times" reporter pointed out that the anti-dictatorial forces are now much broader than in the past.
    The Trujillo regime itself also feels that it is in a precarious state. According to the "New York Times," some of Trujillo's relatives, including his youngest son and daughter, have already fled abroad.
    The U.S. authorities, alarmed by the developments in the Dominican Republic, are actively intervening. A "New York Times" reporter admitted that the recent landing of U.S. Marines in the Dominican Republic was precisely to keep the situation under U.S. control, in order to prevent the Dominican people from overthrowing the dictatorship and establishing an independent and autonomous government like Cuba. The U.S. is currently exerting every effort behind the scenes to implement its conspiracies, with the aim of maintaining the dictatorial tyranny in order to continue using the Dominican Republic for military intervention against Cuba and other Latin American countries.
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 11th – The Soviet "Pravda" today published an article exposing the reactionary crimes of the Dominican dictator and U.S. interference in Dominican internal affairs.
    The article said that the struggle within the Dominican Republic against the traitorous policies of Trujillo, a pawn of American monopoly capitalists, is developing fiercely. The pseudo-elections, killings, prisons and concentration camps manufactured by Trujillo and his cronies are countless. However, terrorist methods cannot shake the Dominican people's love of freedom. At present, the anti-dictatorial front has expanded to an extremely broad stratum of the population. The article said that the threat faced by the Dominican dictatorship makes some figures in Washington very uneasy, and these figures are rushing to support the bankrupt clique. A few days ago, seven U.S. warships carrying four thousand Marines and soldiers arrived in the Dominican capital. In order to cover up the real reason for its interference in Dominican internal affairs, the U.S. claimed that the Marines were in the Dominican Republic for a "vacation."
    The article pointed out that the United States is lying. In 1916, the U.S. Marines occupied the Dominican Republic and spent eight years on "vacation" there. The conspiracies of the protectors of tyranny will never succeed, and threats and provocations cannot reverse the wheels of history. The Dominican people's liberation struggle has already won the warm support of all freedom-loving people in Latin America, and all honest people demand that the United States stop interfering in Dominican internal affairs.
    The article concluded by saying that no force can save a system destined to perish.

    多米尼加独裁政权摇摇欲坠
    苏联“真理报”谴责美国干涉多米尼加内政
    据新华社12日讯　多米尼加反对特鲁希略独裁斗争的怒焰，仍然有增无已。据委内瑞拉情报处10日透露，在过去两星期中多米尼加国内又发生三次示威群众和独裁政权军警冲突的事件，至少有六十三人死亡，七十人受伤。在多米尼加首都的大街上和公园里，青年和学生不顾军警的镇压，高举“打倒特鲁希略”标语牌示威游行。多米尼加爱国者们4日在首都和各地散发了二十五万份号召推翻独裁政权的传单。据加拉加斯同多米尼加流亡者保持接触的外交人士10日说，他们所得到的多米尼加消息表明，特鲁希略独裁政权随时都可能在人民反抗下垮台。
    华盛顿的美国专家们最近在估计多米尼加局势时承认，特鲁希略政权正面临着“三十多年来最有力的反抗”。“纽约时报”的记者指出，目前反独裁力量比过去要广泛得多。
    特鲁希略政权本身也感觉到自己处于朝不保夕的状态。据“纽约时报”透露，特鲁希略的一些亲人，包括他的小儿子和女儿，已经事先逃到国外去了。
    对于多米尼加局势的发展感到恐慌的美国当局正在积极插手干涉。美国“纽约时报”记者承认美国最近派海军陆战队在多米尼加登陆，正是为了把局势控制在美国手里，以阻止多米尼加人民推翻独裁政权并像古巴一样建立一个独立自主的政府。目前美国正在幕后竭力施展阴谋手段，其目的在于保持独裁暴政，以便继续利用多米尼加对古巴和其他拉丁美洲国家进行军事干涉。
    据新华社莫斯科11日电　苏联“真理报”今天发表文章，揭露多米尼加独裁者的反动罪行和美国干涉多米尼加内政。
    文章说，多米尼加国内反对美国垄断资本家的走卒特鲁希略卖国政策的斗争正在猛烈开展，特鲁希略及其同伙所制造的伪选、枪杀、监狱和集中营等罪行是数不清的，然而恐怖手段不能动摇多米尼加人民爱好自由的意志，目前反独裁战线已经扩大到极其广泛的居民阶层。文章说，多米尼加独裁政权面临的威胁使得华盛顿一些人物十分不安，这些人物急忙来支持已破了产的集团。几天前七艘美国军舰载着四千名海军陆战队和士兵开到了多米尼加首都。美国为了掩盖自己干涉多米尼加内政的真正原因，把海军陆战队士兵到多米尼加说成是来“休假”的。
    文章指出，美国在说谎，在1916年美国海军陆战队占领多米尼加后，在那里渡过了八年的“假期”。暴政庇护者的阴谋是绝不能得逞的，威胁和挑衅绝不能扭转历史车轮。多米尼加人民的解放斗争已经获得了拉丁美洲所有爱好自由的人民的热烈支持，一切正直的人们都要求美国停止干涉多米尼加内政。
    文章最后说，没有一种力量能够拯救注定要灭亡的制度。
