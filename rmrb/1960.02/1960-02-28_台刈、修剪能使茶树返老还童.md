Currently, there are still a large number of old tea gardens. These tea gardens suffer from severe gaps in planting, are scattered and sparse, and the tea trees are aging. Not only is the yield low, but management is also inconvenient. It is necessary to thoroughly transform them by adopting measures such as "replanting missing seedlings," "transplanting and merging," and "pruning and trimming," according to different conditions, local conditions, and tree conditions, to gradually transform the existing old tea gardens into robust, lush, concentrated, and modern tea gardens. Spring is the most suitable season for pruning and trimming, and this work should be vigorously carried out by seizing the season. Old trees can restore their vigor, promote more buds and branches, and have large, fleshy leaves after pruning and trimming, thus significantly increasing tea yield. For example, in 1958, 80% of the tea trees in Xiapu County, Fujian Province, were pruned and trimmed, and the output increased by 50% in the same year, and another 30% last year.

According to local experience, pruning or trimming should be decided based on the condition of the tea trees; prune those that should be pruned, and trim those that should be trimmed. Generally, tea trees with dry branches, a lot of moss and lichen, sparse branches and leaves, extremely low yields, and overly aging vigor should be pruned by cutting them off about two inches from the root neck to allow them to re-grow new branches. If the tea tree's vigor is already showing signs of aging, but the branches can still grow normally and there are still relatively many branches and leaves, and the tree's vigor can be restored through pruning, heavy pruning can be carried out by cutting it off one foot to one and a half feet from the root neck. The best time for pruning and trimming is from February to March in spring, when the weather warms up, and the budding force is strong and growth is fast after pruning and trimming. Many experiences have proven that tea trees pruned early before the spring tea can significantly increase production in the same year.

Cultivation and management after pruning and trimming is the key to determining the success of pruning and trimming. After pruning and trimming, it is necessary to firmly grasp cultivation, with major changes requiring major cultivation. It is essential to apply fertilizer multiple times, apply large amounts of fertilizer, cultivate and weed in a timely manner, and conscientiously implement the methods of topping to nourish the canopy, retaining leaves in batches, and harvesting reasonably to cultivate the tree's vigor.

### 台刈、修剪能使茶树返老还童

    台刈、修剪能使茶树返老还童
    目前，还有很大一部分老茶园。这部分茶园缺株严重，零星分散，茶树衰老，不仅产量不高，而且管理不便，必须根据不同情况，因地制宜、因树制宜地采取“补植缺株”、“移植归并”、“台刈修剪”等办法进行彻底改造，逐步把现有老茶园改变成健壮茂盛、集中成片的现代化茶园。春季是台刈、修剪的最适宜的季节，应该抓紧季节大力开展这项工作。老树经过台刈、修剪可以恢复树势，促进多萌芽、多分枝，芽叶肥大，因而可以显著地提高茶叶产量。如福建省霞浦县1958年全县有80％的茶树进行了台刈、修剪，当年就增产50％，去年又增产30％。
    根据各地经验，进行台刈或修剪，应该根据茶树的情况来决定，应该台刈的台刈，应该修剪的修剪。一般枝干干枯，苔藓、地衣多，枝叶稀少，产量极低，树势过于衰老的茶树应行台刈，在离根颈二寸左右的地方剪去，使其重发新枝。如果茶树树势虽已呈现衰老，但枝干还能正常生长，分枝叶片还比较多，通过修剪可以恢复树势的，可进行重修剪，在离根颈一尺到一尺半的地方剪去。台刈、修剪的时间宜在春季2—3月间为最好，这个时期天气转暖，台刈修剪后抽芽力强，生长快。许多经验证明，春茶以前早期修剪的茶树当年春茶就能显著的增产。
    台刈修剪后的培育管理是决定台刈、修剪效果好坏的关键环节。台刈修剪后必须紧紧大抓培育，大改必须大培，一定要多次施肥，大量施肥，及时中耕除草，认真贯彻打顶养蓬，分批留叶合理采摘方法，培养树势。　　　　　　（章茗）
