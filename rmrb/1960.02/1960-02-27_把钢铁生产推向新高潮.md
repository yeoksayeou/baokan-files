    Push Steel Production to a New High Tide
    Today, this newspaper publishes the competition proposal from Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company to steel enterprises nationwide, calling for the early completion of the first quarter plan and full preparation for the second quarter's production. This is a resounding bugle call heralding the imminent arrival of a new production high tide on the national steel industry front! We believe that steelworkers across the country will enthusiastically respond to this proposal, to complete the first quarter steel production plan ahead of schedule, to make full preparations, to raise the second quarter's steel production to a new and higher level that can be fully achieved through effort, to lay a solid foundation for overfulfilling the annual steel production task, and to initiate a vigorous new high tide in steel production.
    The mass movement of the "good start" in 1960 has given China's steel production a good start that has never been seen in previous years. The production situation of steel enterprises in various parts of the country in January and February is better than the same period last year or any previous year. Taking Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company as an example, the company's total output value, the output and quality of major products, the total cost of comparable products, and labor productivity, five major indicators, have all comprehensively overfulfilled the state plan in January; the output of steel, iron, and steel products exceeded the plan by 14%, 3.8%, and 20% respectively; in early February, the output and quality of major products overfulfilled the state plan again. Anshan Iron and Steel Company's thirteen rolling mills have also overfulfilled the steel production plan for the first and middle ten days of February. On the "small-scale and foreign-style" front, the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces nationwide has reached one in January, among which the average utilization coefficient in Anhui Province has reached 1.679. Just over a year ago, the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces nationwide was only about 0.5. It can be said that the "small-scale and foreign-style" of the steel industry has not only gained a firm foothold but can also stand together with the "large-scale and foreign-style." This excellent situation fills us with confidence in completing and overfulfilling this year's steel industry production tasks.
    However, we should never be satisfied. The policy of "taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward" requires us to produce more steel. Producing 10,000 more tons of steel can produce machines worth tens of millions of yuan and can arrange tens of millions of yuan of capital construction workload; that is to say, it can enable the entire national economy to continue to leap forward at a higher speed. In particular, after the acceleration of agricultural technical transformation and the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization have been vigorously carried out throughout the country, the demand for steel, iron, and steel products has increased even more. We must produce as much steel as possible to meet actual needs. Judging from the internal situation of the steel front, the overall situation is good, but there are also imbalances. The production situation of most enterprises is good, but the production situation of some enterprises is not good enough, or sometimes good and sometimes bad, not stable enough. In short, steel production still has great potential. We must not be satisfied with the existing achievements, we must fully tap the potential and further launch a new upsurge in steel production.
    Now, January has long passed, February is nearing its end, and March is already in sight. At this time, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company's proposal for a competition to complete the first quarter's plan ahead of schedule and to fully prepare for the second quarter's production is a proposal of great significance. Although this year's steel production task is even greater than last year, it will definitely be completed and overfulfilled, there is no doubt about that. The question is what kind of attitude should be adopted to complete this year's steel production plan, in order to complete the plan better, overfulfill it more, and be more beneficial to the continued leap forward of the entire national economy. Should all work be rushed forward, racing ahead and not lagging behind, grasping tightly from the very beginning, or should the task of increasing production be postponed and efforts made in the second half of the year? This is not simply a matter of concrete work arrangement, but also a matter of leadership ideology and leadership methods, and also a question of whether to strive for the upstream and whether to muster revolutionary vigor. Some comrades believe that "there is still plenty of time, it is not too late to work hard in the second half of the year," this view is obviously wrong. For us revolutionaries, we should always be full of energy, grasp tightly and fiercely, not waste a minute or a second, and grasp it to the end. We must seize the time, muster greater energy, and start working hard from now on.
    "Taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward" is our guiding principle for the high-speed and proportional continuous leap forward of industrial production. All the comrades and workers fighting on the steel front should make outstanding achievements in the continued leap forward of China's national economy this year, and strive to complete the first quarter's steel production plan three days ahead of schedule, make full preparations for the second quarter's production, and then work hard in the second quarter to raise steel production to a higher level. This step has at least three major benefits. First, it can put us in a more active position. Launching an upsurge in steel production now, and winning a bumper harvest in steel production in the first half of the year, will lay a solid foundation for completing the annual plan, and we can be sure to overfulfill the plan more. Second, it can quickly and earlier supply more steel, iron, and steel products to the needs of various departments of the national economy. If we do not seize the time now and work hard in the second half of the year, then some of the steel, iron, and steel products produced in the second half of the year will be too late to be used in the machinery manufacturing and capital construction of the same year; that is to say, it is impossible to have a better and more comprehensive continued leap forward effect on the national economy in 1960. Although another part can be used in the same year, the time is very short, and the role played is small. Only by grasping steel production now can more steel, iron, and steel products be used in this year's machinery manufacturing and capital construction, so that the manual operation mechanization and semi-mechanization movement can get timely material support, and the entire national economy can achieve a better leap forward. It must be firmly remembered that time is of decisive significance to us here. Third, it can give us ample time to prepare for steel production in 1961. When we do anything, we must see the second step when taking the first step, so that we can plan ahead and move from one victory to another. Why was the "conventional" "high at the end of the year and low at the beginning of the year" broken by the "good start" this year? The most important reason is that as early as the fourth quarter of last year, we made some preparations for this year's production. We are now completing the 1960 plan on the one hand, and also seeing 1961 on the other hand. If we only grasp steel production in the second half of the year, it will be difficult to make more preparations for steel production in 1961. Only by seizing the time to rush forward, racing ahead and not lagging behind, can we free up time in the second half of the year to do a better job in preparing for steel production in 1961.
    "Early in everything," grasping tightly from the beginning, grasping it to the end, is a major event related to the entire national economy and also related to the continued leap forward next year. Now, the workers of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company have taken the lead in sounding the battle drum. Our steelworkers across the country have the same revolutionary spirit as the workers of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, and will certainly be able to complete the first quarter's plan three days ahead of schedule, make full preparations for the second quarter's production, and lay a good foundation for overfulfilling the annual steel production task.
    Completing the first quarter's steel production plan three days ahead of schedule has many favorable conditions. After two years of the Great Leap Forward, China's steel production capacity has grown rapidly, the enthusiasm of steelworkers has been even greater, and their technical experience has become richer. Of course, this does not mean that there is no need to do hard work anymore. Our equipment has increased a lot, but the equipment needs to be repaired after a certain period of time, which requires us to better arrange production and production preparation work, not only paying attention to the annual and quarterly production preparation work, but also paying attention to the monthly and daily production preparation work. Our various fronts of the steel industry, from mining, ironmaking, steelmaking to steel rolling, from "large-scale and foreign-style" to "small-scale and foreign-style," although all have been greatly strengthened, there are still relatively weak links, and new weak links will continue to emerge in the future, which need to be grasped continuously. We have accumulated rich technical experience, such as multi-charging and fast smelting of open-hearth furnaces, hot-air blowing of small converters, etc., but the promotion is not yet widespread enough, and we must continue to popularize it. What is particularly important is to grasp the work of transportation and saving coke. Due to the continuous leap forward of steel production, more and higher demands have been placed on coal production and transportation work. On the one hand, coal mine workers are required to produce more coal, and transportation workers are required to transport more coal, pig iron, and ore to steel enterprises in a timely manner; but for steel enterprise workers, the most important thing is that they should not build their own production increase plans on external conditions, but should first think of more ways themselves. For example, in-plant transportation should be done well, and no trucks should be held up, which can create better working conditions for the transportation department; the work of saving coke should be grasped tightly, and the amount of coal used in the steel industry should be reduced. This is the attitude of the revolutionaries.
    The new upsurge in steel production in 1960 has arrived. We hope that steelworkers across the country will respond to the proposal of the workers of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, take action immediately, and throw themselves into this new upsurge. We hope that people across the country, especially coal miners and transportation workers, and all personnel related to steel production, will also mobilize to give greater support to the upsurge in steel production, and ensure the completion and overfulfillment of this year's leap forward plan for steel production!

### 把钢铁生产推向新高潮

    把钢铁生产推向新高潮
    今天本报发表了北京石景山钢铁公司向全国钢铁企业发出的提前完成第一季度计划，充分做好第二季度生产准备工作的竞赛倡议。这是全国钢铁工业战线上一个新的生产高潮即将开始的嘹亮号角！我们相信，全国钢铁职工必将热烈地响应这个倡议，为提前完成第一季度钢铁生产计划，做好充分的准备工作，把第二季度的钢铁生产提高到一个经过努力完全可以达到的新的更高的水平，为超额完成全年钢铁生产任务打下良好基础，掀起一个轰轰烈烈的钢铁生产的新高潮。
    1960年的“开门红”的群众运动，使我国钢铁生产得到一个往年从来不曾有过的良好的开端。全国各地钢铁企业1、2两月的生产情况比去年以至过去任何一年的同期都要好。以石景山钢铁公司为例，这个公司1月份的总产值、主要产品的产量和质量、可比产品总成本和劳动生产率五大指标，都全面超额完成了国家计划；钢、铁、钢材的产量分别超过计划14％、3．8％和20％；2月上旬主要产品的产量和质量又超额完成了国家计划。鞍山钢铁公司十三个轧钢厂，2月上中旬的钢材生产计划也已超额完成。在“小洋群”战线上，1月份全国小高炉的平均利用系数已经达到一，其中安徽省全省平均利用系数已经达到一点六七九。而一年多以前，全国小高炉的平均利用系数还只有零点五左右。可以说，钢铁工业的“小洋群”不仅已经站稳了脚跟，而且已经可以同“大洋群”站在一起。这一派大好形势，使我们对完成和超额完成今年钢铁工业的生产任务充满了信心。
    但是，我们永远也不应该满足。“以钢为纲，全面跃进”的方针，要求我们生产出更多的钢来。多产一万吨钢，就可以多生产价值几千万元的机器，就可以多安排几千万元的基本建设工作量；也就是说，就可以使整个国民经济用更高的速度继续跃进。特别是加快农业技术改造和以机械化半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动在全国蓬勃开展以后，钢、铁和钢材的需要量有了更大的增加。我们必须尽可能生产出更多的钢铁来满足实际的需要。从钢铁战线内部的情况来看，总的形势是良好的，但是也有不平衡的现象。大多数企业的生产情况是好的，也有一些企业的生产情况还不够好，或者时好时差，不够稳定。总而言之，钢铁生产仍然有很大的潜力。我们决不能满足于已有的成就，一定要充分挖掘潜力，进一步掀起一个新的钢铁生产高潮。
    现在，1月早已过去，2月临近末尾，3月已经在望。在这个时候，石景山钢铁公司发出了提前完成第一季度计划，充分做好第二季度生产准备工作的竞赛倡议，是一个具有重大意义的倡议。今年的钢铁生产任务尽管比去年更加巨大，但是一定能够完成和超额完成，这是毫无疑问的。问题是采取什么样的态度去完成今年的钢铁生产计划，才能把计划完成得更好，超额得更多，对整个国民经济的继续跃进更有利。是一切工作往前赶，赶前不赶后，一开始就抓紧呢，还是把增产的任务往后推，到下半年再努力呢？这，并不简单是一个具体工作的安排问题，而且是一个领导思想和领导方法的问题，也是一个是不是力争上游和是不是鼓足革命干劲的问题。有的同志认为“来日方长，到下半年再努力也不迟”，这种看法显然是不对的。对于我们革命者来说，任何时候都应该干劲冲天，紧抓狠抓，不虚度一分一秒的时间，一直抓到底。我们必须抓紧时间，鼓起更大的干劲，从现在起就大干起来。
    “以钢为纲，全面跃进”，是我们指导工业生产高速度和按比例地不断跃进的方针。奋战在钢铁战线上的全体职工同志们，应当在今年我国国民经济的继续跃进中做出优异的成绩，力争提前三天完成第一季度的钢铁生产计划，为第二季度的生产做好充分准备，然后再在第二季度大干特干，把钢铁生产提高到一个更高的水平上来。这一步骤至少有三大好处。一是可以使我们处于更加主动的地位。现在就掀起钢铁生产的高潮，赢得上半年钢铁生产的大丰收，就为完成全年计划打下了巩固的基础，可以有把握地更多地超额完成计划。二是可以迅速地更早地把更多的钢、铁、钢材供应国民经济各部门的需要。如果现在不抓紧，到下半年再大干，那末，下半年生产的钢、铁和钢材，有一部分已经来不及运用到当年的机械制造和基本建设中去；也就是说，不可能对1960年国民经济更好更全面的继续跃进发生作用了。另外一部分虽能在当年利用上，但时间很短，发挥的作用也就小了。只有现在开始就大抓钢铁生产，才能使更多的钢、铁和钢材在今年的机械制造和基本建设中得到应用，使手工操作机械化和半机械化运动得到及时的物质支援，使整个国民经济能够实现更好的跃进。必须牢牢记住，时间在这里对我们有着决定性的意义。三是可以使我们有充分的时间为1961年的钢铁生产做好准备。我们做任何事情，在走第一步的时候都要看到第二步，才能深谋远虑地从一个胜利走向另一个胜利。为什么历年来“年末高、年初低”的“常规”，在今年被“开门红”打破了呢？最主要的原因是，远在去年第四季度我们就为今年的生产做了一些准备工作。我们现在一方面要完成1960年的计划，另一方面也要看到1961年。如果我们到下半年才抓紧钢铁生产，就难于为1961年的钢铁生产做更多的准备工作。只有抓紧时间往前赶，赶前不赶后，下半年才能腾出时间来把1961年钢铁生产的准备工作做得更好。
   “一早百早”，一开始就抓紧，一抓到底，是关系到整个国民经济，也是关系到明年继续跃进的大事。现在，石景山钢铁公司的职工已经首先擂起战鼓了。我们全国钢铁职工都有像石景山钢铁公司职工一样的革命干劲，一定能够提前三天完成第一季度计划，充分做好第二季度生产准备工作，为超额完成全年的钢铁生产任务打下良好的基础。
    提前三天完成第一季度钢铁生产计划是有许多有利条件的。经过两年的大跃进，我国的钢铁生产能力已经有了迅速的增长，钢铁工人的干劲更大了，技术经验也更加丰富了。当然，这并不是说就不需要再做艰苦的工作了。我们的设备有了很大的增加，但是设备经过一定时间就需要检修，这就需要我们把生产和生产准备工作安排得更好，不但要注意年度的和季度的生产准备工作，而且要注意月度的和日常的生产准备工作。我们钢铁工业的各个战线，从采矿、炼铁、炼钢到轧钢，从“大洋群”到“小洋群”，虽然都有了很大的加强，但是仍有比较薄弱的环节，同时今后也还会继续出现新的薄弱环节，需要继续抓紧。我们已经积累了丰富的技术经验，例如平炉的多装快炼，小转炉的热风吹炼等等，但是推广得还不够普遍，还要继续普及。特别重要的是，要抓紧运输和节约焦炭的工作。由于钢铁生产的连续大跃进，对煤炭的生产和运输工作提出了更多更高的要求，这一方面要求煤矿职工生产更多的煤炭，要求运输职工把更多的煤炭、生铁和矿石及时运到钢铁企业；但是对钢铁企业的职工说来，最重要的是，不应该把自己的增产计划建筑在外部条件上，而首先应该自己多想些办法。例如，应该把厂内运输搞好，不压一辆车，这就能给运输部门创造更好的工作条件；应该大抓节约焦炭的工作，减少钢铁工业的用煤量。这才是革命派的态度。
    1960年钢铁生产的新高潮来到了。我们希望全国钢铁职工响应石景山钢铁公司职工的倡议，立即行动起来，投身到这个新的高潮中去。我们希望全国人民，特别是煤矿工人和运输工人，和一切与钢铁生产有关的人员，也都动员起来，给钢铁生产的高潮以更大的支持，保证完成和超额完成今年的钢铁生产的跃进计划！
