Title: Flying Tiger Cart

A thunderclap on the flat ground – the "old expert" was defeated by the "Flying Tiger Cart"! This is quite a novelty. First thing this morning, I rushed to the headquarters of the First Brigade, wanting to get to the bottom of it.

All the way, I kept thinking about the past. It was last autumn when everyone was holding a meeting to discuss how to further develop the manure collection campaign. Uncle Tang Wu strode into the door. Without asking any questions, he interrupted, saying: "There's no shortage of fertilizer, it just depends on whether you look for it; as long as everyone looks, there's plenty of green grass on the slopes; everyone take a sickle, and you won't be able to use up all the green manure you can compost." Later, following Uncle Tang Wu's method, more than 500,000 jin of fertilizer were found at once.

From then on, Uncle Tang Wu became the head of the fertilizer factory. After that, he reformed several tools. Since then, I don't know who put this iron gauze cap of "old expert" on him, and he couldn't take it off.

I was just thinking about this when I met Secretary Li of the Second Brigade. Before he could speak, I asked: "Secretary Li, what's the deal with the Flying Tiger Cart?" Secretary Li said unhurriedly: "Take a breath first, and come with me to the bottom of the mountain to take a look, and you'll naturally understand!"

We faced the east wind, and soon arrived at the fertilizer factory. As soon as I entered the factory, I was stunned. I saw six thick iron ropes, divided into two halves, three going up and three going down, one end rooted at the bottom of the mountain and the other extending to the top of the high mountain; a long string of carriages was installed on the iron ropes at the bottom of the mountain, and the four iron wheels looked like two pairs of small iron rings. At first glance, it looked like the high-line架 [jia - frame] that was tied last year, but on closer inspection, it was very different. The high-line 架 only used two wooden boxes, but this was a long string, like a giant dragon, climbing up from this end and rolling down from that end, loading and unloading automatically. As long as five people operate it, it can replace five hundred laborers. The big piles of fertilizer at the fertilizer factory were transported to the high-yield fields on the mountain in just a few hours...

The more I looked, the happier I became. I was about to open my mouth to ask for details when I heard someone in the distance reciting a jingle: "Flying Cart 架, Flying Cart 架, six iron wires hanging in the sky; automatic up, automatic down, better than the wooden ox and flowing horse of yesteryear..."

"Oh, the old expert is here!" I exclaimed, quickly stepped forward, and said with a smile: "Your cart is really good, experts really come up with good ideas." For some reason, the "old expert's" face flushed red to the roots of his ears. After a long while, he said: "Alas, what expert am I? This time I was defeated by 'brute force'! In a word, it's all because I was a bit conservative and a bit complacent!"

After he said this, I was stunned. Could it be that this giant dragon was really created by "brute force"? Who doesn't know that Lin Hu is a rigid person! He only knows how to work with his head down, and never believes that any tricks or methods can solve problems, and often says: "Wisdom is false, hard work is true, strength is seven points." Could this famous "brute force" of the village really create this thing?

I couldn't believe my ears, so I asked in surprise: "Was this really created by Lin Hu?" Secretary Li's eyes rolled around, and after a long while, he said meaningfully: "What do you think? Don't you believe it either? Our Lin Hu is like Yan Yan who was captured by Zhang Fei at Bazhou at night – rough but meticulous!" I didn't know what to say for a while, and the "old expert" immediately picked up the thread and kept talking.

It turned out that at the beginning of this year's preparation for spring plowing, the Second Brigade immediately launched a high tide of tool reform. As soon as the fertilizer factory stepped up its efforts, several big mountains of fertilizer piled up in the yard in just a few days, but they couldn't be transported out in time. The "old expert" was anxious, so he posted a red notice declaring that whoever could transport these fertilizers to the mountain within five days, he would willingly take him as his teacher.

This attracted many heroes and good men. Who wouldn't want to strive for the upstream and compete with the "old expert"! They thought hard, some reading books and looking for materials alone, and others studying in groups of three or five. Just at this moment, the red list was torn off, and the farm tool factory suddenly burst into an uproar, and everyone was spreading the word: "Lin Hu is making a big fuss about technical innovation!"

At first, the "old expert" didn't quite believe it. Later, the rumors grew louder and louder, so he sent his grandson out to inquire about the news.

He paced back and forth in the house alone, muttering: "Lin Hu, Lin Hu, can you really make a name for yourself..." Before he finished speaking, his little grandson ran in mischievously, deliberately put his hand on his mouth, making a trumpet shape, aimed at his grandfather's ear, and shouted loudly: "Flying – Tiger – Cart – has been created successfully!"

The "old expert" said here, his face flushed red, looking a little embarrassed. I guessed his mood and said jokingly: "Hey, this time, our tiger has really grown wings!" The "old expert" continued: "That's right, the sea cannot be measured! In the era of the Great Leap Forward, we can no longer look at people and things with conservative glasses!"

    飞虎车
    杨忠
    平地一声春雷，“老专家”被“飞虎车”战败了。这倒是件新鲜事儿。今早一起来，我便跑到第一大队队部去，想打问个底细。
    一路上，我不住地想着往事。那是去年秋季，大伙正开会研究如何进一步开展积肥运动，唐武大伯一步跨进了大门。他二话没问，便插嘴说道：“肥料倒不少，看你找不找；只要大家都去找，崖坡有的是青草；每人一把镰，沤的绿肥用不了。”后来，按照唐武大伯的办法，一下找到了五十多万斤肥料。
    从此，唐武大伯便当上了肥料厂长。接着，他又改革了几件工具。打那以后，不知谁给他戴上了这顶“老专家”的铁纱帽，再也卸不下来了。
    我正想到这里，迎面碰见了第二大队李书记。没等他说话，我便开口问道：“李书记，飞虎车是咋回事呀？”李书记不紧不慢地说：“你先缓口气儿，跟我到山下面去看看，自然就明白了呵！”
    我俩迎着东风，不大时候就来到了肥料厂。一进厂，我一下楞住了。只见六根粗铁绳，分为两半，三根向上，三根向下，一头扎在山底下，一头伸到高山顶上；山下铁绳上又安装着一长串车厢，四个铁轮儿倒像两双小铁环儿。乍一看，活像去年拴的高线架，但仔细看来，大有不同。高线架只用两个木箱，可这是一长串，像条巨龙，从这头爬上去，又从那头滚下来，自动装，自动倒，只要五个人操作，就能抵上五百个劳动力哩。肥料厂的大肥堆子，没用几个钟头就运到山上的丰产方里去了……
    我越看越高兴，刚要张口问问详情，又听远处谁在说着顺口溜：“飞车架，飞车架，六根铁丝天上挂；自动上，自动下，胜过当年的木牛和流马……”
    “嗬，老专家来了呀！”我失声地叫了一声，赶紧走上前去，笑着说：“你们这车可真好呀，到底是专家会出点子。”不知为啥原因，
  “老专家”的脸一下红到了耳根。半晌，他才说道：“唉，还是啥专家哩，这次可败到‘蛮劲’手里了！一句话，都怪自己有点儿保守，还带点自满！”
    经他这么一说，我倒愣住了。难道这巨龙，当真是“蛮劲”创造的？谁不知道，林虎这人是个死脑筋呀！他只知道低着头干活儿，从不相信什么窍门呀、办法呀，能解决问题，口里还常说：“智假工夫真，有力强七分。”这个庄上有名的“蛮劲”，他真能创造这玩意吗？
    我有点不相信自己的耳朵，便吃惊地问道：“这当真是林虎创造的吗？”李书记的眼珠转来转去，半晌，才意味深长地说：“怎么样？你也不相信吗？咱们的林虎，可是个夜过巴州收严颜——粗中有细的人呀！”我一时不知说什么好，“老专家”立刻接上话把儿，一个劲地说开了。
    原来，今年的备耕工作一开始，第二大队立刻又掀起了一个大闹工具改革的高潮。肥料厂一加劲儿，没多少天，院子里便堆下了几座大山，干急运不出去。“老专家”心里一急，就贴出了一张红榜声言谁要在五天内，把这些肥料运上山去，自己情愿拜他为师。
    这一来，可招来了不少英雄好汉。谁不愿意力争上游，和“老专家”赛一赛呀！他们千思万想，有独个儿翻书本、找材料的，也有三、五人一搭儿研究的。正在这当儿，红榜被人揭掉了，农具厂里猛然嚷翻了天，大家都相传着：“林虎大闹技术革新了！”
    起初，“老专家”还有些不大相信。后来，风声越来越大了，他就派孙孙出外打探消息去了。
    他一个人在房子里踱来踱去，嘴里还念叨着：“林虎呀，林虎，你当真能闹出个名堂么……”一语未了，小孙子调皮地跑了进来，故意地把手放在嘴上，做成了一个喇叭口，对准爷爷的耳朵，大声喊道：“飞——虎——车——创造成功啦！”
    “老专家”说到这里，脸上泛起了红晕，很有点不好意思的样子。我猜着了他的心情，便打趣地说：“嗨，这一下，咱们的老虎，可真是添上翅膀啦！”“老专家”接着说：“可不，海水不可斗量嘛，在大跃进的时代呀，可不能再戴上保守的眼镜看人看事啦！”
