    Mountain Village Urges Spring
    Our Reporter: Long Wenming, Meng Fanqin
    According to local customs, spring only begins to arrive when the tung trees blossom in February or March. However, this year, while the mountains are still covered in white snow, the commune members have already brought spring to the world.
    On January 20th, we visited the Shouche People's Commune in Yongshun County, Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture. It is the earliest mountain village in the autonomous prefecture to urge spring. As we traveled along the rugged road to the Shouche valley, a charming spring scene unfolded before our eyes: tens of thousands of farmers of various ethnic groups, reclaiming mountains and opening up wasteland, almost covered every hilltop. Red flags fluttered in the wind on the mountains and below. In the fields, propaganda teams sang, played the *yī wú* instrument, and beat gongs and drums. The terraced cornfields along the road were well-prepared, with neat ridges leading to the top of the mountain, like ladders. Every terrace ridge was piled with fire-soil ash. Several terraces marked as "Corn High-Yield Command Base" were divided into ditches and ridges, arranged horizontally and vertically, with fine and even soil, a layer of fertile manure soil, and a layer of fire-soil ash, as carefully arranged as embroidery. The continuous terraced fields had all been plowed over, and the weeds on the ridges had been cleared away. The fields appeared to have been plowed at least three or four times, and as long as a mixed-water rake was used and water was poured in, seedlings could be transplanted. Wang Zhongding, the first secretary of the commune party committee, told us: "In order to welcome the first spring of the 1960s, we have ensured that water is available to the fields, fertilizer is available to the fields, the fields are waiting for seedlings, and the soil is waiting for seeds. We have already completed the work that would normally be done in the one or two months after the Spring Festival ahead of schedule."
    The next day, the weather was gloomy, and the north wind was mixed with snowflakes flying everywhere. We followed Comrade Wang Zhongding, the first secretary of the commune party committee, to Banhu Brigade to see a piece of paddy field that was being leveled and prepared for sowing. Despite the cold weather, the people harrowing the fields and delivering manure were all in high spirits, shouting and chasing each other. If it weren't for the snow, it would indeed be hard to believe that this was winter.
    Liu Changyun, the secretary of the brigade party branch, told us: "To ensure a bumper harvest this year, we must prepare the paddy fields in winter." After speaking, he stared blankly at a few tung trees facing the sun for a while, and then told us a story about the "Spring Knowing Tree" (i.e., the tung tree): In the past, every spring, there was an old man in the village named Wu Xianmei who would only allow the young people to prepare the fields and cultivate seedlings after seeing the tung flowers bloom. For this reason, he also built a house opposite the "Spring Knowing Tree" to watch for spring at any time. In the long past, local farmers waited for the arrival of spring in this way, at the mercy of nature. Now, more than two months before the tung blossoms, the paddy fields have been leveled like mirrors, waiting only for sowing. Wu Xianmei is no longer the "spring watching" old man, but has become the "spring urging" old man. In the days of the great paddy field preparation a few days ago, although he was old and weak and could not go down to the fields, he spent the whole day delivering cattle grass and carrying plows to the fields, participating in the "spring urging" campaign. He sang to everyone he met:
    (In the past) Start reclaiming land after the Start of Spring and Rain Water, prepare for farming busily after Pure Brightness and Grain Rain; people don't know spring, but the tree knows spring,
    Plant rice seedlings after the tung blossoms.
    (Now) Start reclaiming land greatly in the tenth and twelfth lunar months, prepare for farming busily during Minor Cold and Major Cold;
    The tree doesn't know spring, but people know spring, rice seedlings can be transplanted after the tung blossoms.
    A bustling spring scene also appeared on the high, cold mountain tops. This is because all the production teams living on the mountain tops have moved their paddy fields down the mountain for cultivation this year. In the past, only one crop of medium rice was grown on the high, cold mountain tops. Every year in July and August, when the rice was heading and flowering, it often suffered from drought and failed to produce. If the seedling cultivation season is advanced by one or two months, the rice will have already turned yellow and ripened by then, and even if there is a drought, a bumper harvest can be obtained. Wang Zhongding, the first secretary of the commune party committee, told us that the matter of mountain top farmers cultivating seedlings down the mountain to advance the season in high, cold mountainous areas has happened before. More than forty years ago, in Dazhai of Banhu Brigade, there was a poor Miao farmer named Wu Guangrong who borrowed paddy field from a poor Han farmer Gao Yinchun in Banhu village to cultivate seedlings, and exceptionally transplanted seedlings more than a month earlier on the high mountain. That year, there was a severe drought in July and August, and most of the rice on the high mountain failed to produce, but Wu Guangrong's early rice, because it had turned yellow and ripened before the severe drought, obtained a full harvest. This miracle of increased production caused a sensation in the high, cold mountain village. However, this good thing was destroyed by the landlord bully Gao Zhulou who provoked ethnic relations between the mountain below and the mountain above. After the realization of the people's commune, the Tujia, Miao, and Han farmers were even more united and affectionate, and the matter of moving paddy fields decades ago was brought up again. Last year, the commune party committee helped the Miao farmers in Dazhai cultivate four mu of early rice seedlings in the Banhu plains and moved them back to the mountain top to plant. Later, although they suffered a rare drought of more than eighty days, the average yield per mu for both the early and late rice seasons was still more than 1,300 jin. This fact proves that the season in high, cold mountainous areas can not only be advanced, but also avoid summer and autumn droughts and ensure a bumper harvest. This year, the Tujia, Miao, and Han farmers living on the mountain tops have all moved their paddy fields to the plains. This is a friendly collaboration between the various ethnic groups in the entire commune. In order to help the brother teams plant earlier in the season, the Han farmers in Banhu village gave more than ten mu of fertile fields with good sunshine and sufficient water to the Miao farmers in Dazhai as paddy fields, and also provided labor and fertilizer to help them prepare the fields well. Now, these more than ten mu of paddy fields have all been leveled like mirrors, waiting only for sowing.
    In this mountain village, moving stories of urging spring are emerging everywhere. In the past, Tujia farmers would not go up the mountain to dig soil until after the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, saying that if the soil was moved too early, the crops would not grow. In the movement of "act early, realize early," this kind of superstition has been washed away by the tide of urging spring. As early as before "Minor Cold" and "Major Cold," the heroic Tujia, Miao, and Han farmers took up hoes and went up the mountain to open up wasteland and prepare the soil, launching a lively production competition on the cloud-covered high mountains. In Nazhu Production Team, we heard such a story: There was a blind man named Xu Xinghui who was a skilled sandal maker, able to make eighteen pairs a day. In the past, he also had his busy and idle seasons for making sandals. Every year, he would only be busy making sandals when the cherry blossoms bloomed and the commune members all went to work. But in the winter, he often idled and warmed himself by the fire. However, in the winter of 1959, his seasonal experience of making sandals was no longer applicable. One night, the production team meeting was held in his room. Xu Xinghui sat by the fire listening quietly to everyone's speeches. When he heard the captain arranging work and proposing which group should open up wasteland and which group should prepare paddy fields, he pulled the canteen accountant sitting next to him and quietly asked: "What kind of meeting is being held today? Is it discussing production plans?" The accountant told him: "This year is not the same as in previous years. Now we are greatly preparing paddy fields and opening up wasteland. We are going to plant twice as much corn as last year." Xu Xinghui heard this and asked in surprise: "You haven't rested this winter! Are the sandals still enough to supply?" The canteen accountant told him that the brigade needed sandals. After hearing these words, he took out the tools he had stored under the bed that night and started making sandals. He said: "Now there is no season for making sandals. People are working without rest in winter, and we sandal makers must also work harder!"
    This year, the Shouche Commune in the high, cold mountainous area, due to the early cultivation season, will change from growing one crop of corn to growing two crops, and from growing one crop of medium rice to growing two crops of rice. The area of single-season early rice has increased by more than two times compared with last year, and the early corn area has exceeded one time the area planted throughout the year last year. The total grain output this year will double that of last year. Now, what the commune party committee is considering is no longer the issue of preparing for cultivation, but is studying how to carry out rush planting.

    山寨催春
    本报记者　龙文明　孟繁勤
    按照当地的老习惯，要等到2、3月油桐花开的时候，春天才开始到来。然而在今年，当山上还披挂着皑皑白雪的时候，人民公社的社员们却已经把春天催到了人间。
    1月20日，我们访问了湘西土家族苗族自治州永顺县首车人民公社。它是自治州催春最早的山寨。当我们行经崎岖道路来到首车山坳的时候，一幅迷人的春景展现在我们眼前：成千上万治山开荒的各族农民，几乎布满了各个山头，山上山下红旗迎风招展，田间鼓动队，唱歌、打咿唔，锣鼓喧天。路边几块办好的包谷山，畦磴整齐，通到山顶，有如云梯。每块梯地的地埂上都堆满了火土灰。有几块标明是“包谷丰产指挥基地”的梯地，分沟分畦，横竖成行，泥土又碎又匀，一层肥粪土，一层火土灰，整得像绣花一样。连坡的梯田已都犁翻过来，田埂上的杂草铲得精光。地里看来至少已经犁翻过三次或四次，只要打上一道混水耙，灌上水，就可以插上秧苗。公社党委第一书记王中定对我们说：“为了迎接六十年代的第一个春天，我们已经做到了水到田、肥到田、田等秧、土等种，春节后一两个月的活，现在已经提前做完啦。”
    第二天，天气阴沉，北风夹杂着雪花四处飞舞。我们随着公社党委第一书记王中定同志去伴湖大队观看一片正在平整待播的秧田。尽管天气很冷，而耙田送粪的人个个精神抖擞，吆喝连天，你追我赶。如果不是下雪，的确使人难以相信这里正是冬天。
    大队党总支书记柳昌运同志对我们说：“要保证今年大丰收，就得冬天办秧田。”说完，他面对几株向阳的油桐树，呆呆地望了一阵，然后给我们讲了一个“知春树”（即油桐树）的故事：从前，每年春天，寨里有个叫吴贤美的老人，总是要看到油桐花开，才准后生们整田育秧。为了这事，他还在“知春树”的对面盖了一栋房子，随时看春。在过去漫长的岁月里，当地农民就是这样的坐等着春天到来，听候大自然的支配。如今，距离油桐开花还有两个多月，秧田却已平整如镜，只待播种。吴贤美也不再是“看春”老人，而成了“催春”的老人了。在前几天大整秧田的日子里，他虽然年迈体弱不能下田，但他成天到田间送牛草、运犁头，参加“催春大会战”。他逢人就唱：
    （过去）立春雨水才开荒，清明谷雨备耕忙；人不知春树知春，
    油桐花开下谷秧。
    （现在）十冬腊月大开荒，小寒大寒备耕忙；
    树不知春人知春，油桐花开能插秧。
    在高寒的山顶，也同样呈现出一片繁忙的春景。因为凡是居住在高山顶上的生产队，今年的秧田都搬下山来培育了。高寒山顶往年只种一季中稻，每到7、8月份正当抽穗扬花之时，常因遭受干旱失收。如果把育秧季节提早一两个月，到时稻谷已经勾头黄熟，再旱也能获得丰收。公社党委第一书记王中定同志告诉我们，山顶农民下山培育秧苗提早高寒山区季节的事，很早就有过。四十多年前，伴湖大队的大寨，有个名叫吴光荣的苗族贫农，曾借用伴湖山寨一个汉族贫农高阴春的坪坝田育过秧苗，在高山上破例提早一个多月插上了秧苗。这年，7、8月大旱，高山上的稻子大部失收，而吴光荣的早稻由于抢在大旱前勾头黄熟，获得了全收。这一增产奇迹，轰动了高寒山寨。但是，这样的好事却因恶霸地主高竹楼挑拨山下山上民族关系而破坏了。实现人民公社化以后，土家、苗、汉族农民更加团结亲热，几十年前搬秧田的事又被提起。去年，公社党委帮助大寨苗族农民在伴湖坪坝培育了四亩早稻秧搬回山顶去种。后来，虽然遭受了八十多天稀有的大旱，早晚稻两季仍然平均亩产一千三百多斤。这个事实证明了高寒山区季节不仅可以提早，而且可以避免夏秋干旱，确保丰收。今年居住在山顶上的土家、苗、汉各族农民都把秧田搬到坪坝里来，这是全社各族农民之间的友谊大协作。为了帮助兄弟队提早栽种季节，伴湖山寨的汉族农民把十多亩阳光好水利足的肥田让给大寨的苗族农民作秧田，还出劳力、出肥料，帮助他们把田整好。如今，这十多亩秧田已全都整平如镜，只待播种。
    在这山寨里，到处涌现出动人的催春事迹。从前，土家族农民要过了正月十五才上山挖土。说动早了土，不长庄稼。在“早动手，早兑现”的运动中，这种迷信已被催春的浪潮冲散。早在“小寒”“大寒”之前，英雄的土家、苗、汉族农民，就挥锄上山，开荒整土，在那云雾密布的高山上，开展了热火朝天的生产竞赛。在那住生产队，我们听到一个这样的故事：有个瞎子叫徐兴辉，是个打草鞋的能手，一天能打十八双。这个人过去打草鞋也有他的忙闲季节，每年要到樱桃花开，社员们都出工了，他才忙着打草鞋；要是到了冬天呀，他就常常闲手烤火。可是，1959年冬天，他这种打草鞋按季节的经验已经不适用了。有天夜晚，队上的生产会在他住的房里召开。徐兴辉坐在火边静听大家发言，当他听到队长在安排活路时，提出哪个组去开荒，哪个组去整秧田时，他拉了坐在身边的食堂会计一把，悄悄地问：“今天是开的什么会呀？是讨论生产规划吗？”会计对他说：“今年可不比往年呀，如今我们正在大整秧田，大开生荒，包谷要比去年多种一倍呢。”徐兴辉听到这里，惊奇的问：“你们今冬都没歇气呀！现在草鞋还供得上不？”食堂会计告诉他，大队正需要草鞋。他听到这些话后，当天晚上便把收藏在床底下的工具拿出来，打起草鞋来了。他说：“现在打草鞋可没有什么季节了，冬天人干活不歇气，我们打草鞋的也要加劲打呀！”
    今年，高寒山区的首车公社，由于提早了耕作季节，将使种一季包谷改为种两季，一季中稻改种双季稻。单季早稻面积比去年增加了两倍多，早包谷地超过了去年全年所种面积的一倍。今年的粮食总产量将比去年翻一番。现在，公社党委所考虑的已不是备耕问题，而是在研究如何进行抢播的问题了。
