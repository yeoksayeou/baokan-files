Increase Branches, Increase Pods, Increase Grain Weight - Rapeseed Yield Reaches New Heights
Xindu Launches "Three Increases and One Weight" Campaign Centered on Water and Fertilizer

Four Methods to Promote Rapeseed's "Three Increases and One Weight"
Xindu County is carrying out a "Three Increases and One Weight" campaign to increase rapeseed branches, pods, grains, and grain weight. Specific measures include the following four points:

One, Increase Fertilizer Application. Rapeseed is a crop that requires a lot of fertilizer. According to its growth characteristics, to increase branches, pods, and grains, it is necessary to heavily apply fertilizer at the seedling, bolting, and initial flowering stages. From the seedling to the initial flowering stage, fertilize every five to seven days, for a total of four or more applications. Each time, apply 30 to 40 loads of high-quality night soil per mu, and supplement with some phosphate fertilizer and fine fertilizers such as oil cake and chemical fertilizer. The ratio of various fertilizers is: nitrogen 40%, phosphorus 30%, potassium 30%. Fertilizer application should focus on different periods: the seedling stage should focus on fast-acting nitrogen fertilizer, while the bolting and flowering stages should be supplemented with more phosphorus and potassium fertilizer. When the rapeseed flowers are finished, two to three foliar fertilizer applications should be carried out continuously (one jin of ammonium sulfate and calcium superphosphate diluted in 200 to 300 jin of water per mu).

Two, Rational Irrigation. Rapeseed is also a crop that requires a lot of water, especially Victory rapeseed. From the seedling to the flowering stage, there must be sufficient water supply to achieve high yields. This year, there is also a spring drought, so more attention should be paid to rational irrigation. From the seedling to the flowering and pod-setting stage, it is best to irrigate three times: the first time at the bolting stage, the second time at the flowering stage, and the third time at the end of the flowering stage. The irrigation method must be furrow irrigation to avoid soil compaction and nutrient loss.

Three, Bee Pollination. Rapeseed is a cross-pollinated crop. Increasing the number of bee colonies to assist pollination can generally increase production by 8%-10%.

Four, Thoroughly Eliminate Pests and Diseases. Pests and diseases are the great enemies of rapeseed yield increase and must be strictly prevented and controlled. In addition to preventive measures such as cultivating and loosening the soil and cleaning the fields, special personnel should be assigned to check daily, and once discovered, they should be eliminated immediately. For sclerotinia, a mixture of two parts grass ash and one part lime can be applied to the rapeseed nests for prevention and control. For virus diseases, spraying lime sulfur mixture and scattering lime and plant ash, as well as removing diseased plants, can be used for prevention and control. In addition, spraying garlic water (one jin of garlic pounded into a paste and soaked in 50 jin of water) once every half month; and picking up yellow foot leaves at any time also has a good effect on preventing and controlling various pests and diseases.

(By our correspondent) Xindu County, Sichuan Province, famous for its high rapeseed yields, is tightly grasping the current period when rapeseed growth enters the bolting stage and vigorous branching period. It is using the method of full-scale attack with large amounts of fertilizer and water to carry out a "Three Increases and One Weight" campaign to vigorously increase rapeseed branches, pods, grains, and grain weight.

The rapeseed "Three Increases and One Weight" campaign is the essence extracted by the Xindu County Party Committee from years of high rapeseed yield experience. Last year, more than one mu of rapeseed field in Qingbaijiang Commune in the county, because it seized the period from rapeseed seedling to pod-setting, continuously applied eight times of fast-acting fertilizer, and increased the application of more than 19,000 jin of ammonium nitrate; at the same time, combined with irrigation, it was given enough to eat and drink, resulting in far more branches, pods, and grains than ordinary fields, and achieved a high yield record of 917 jin per mu. The year before last, two rapeseed fields numbered 19 and 20 in the first cultivation area of Guihu Commune in the county had the same base fertilizer, transplanting period, and density. They also applied four top dressings during the seedling stage, two top dressings during the bolting stage, and top dressing during the initial flowering stage. However, because field No. 20 applied two more top dressings during the seedling stage and after the initial flowering stage, the yield of field No. 20 increased by 78.5 jin compared with field No. 19 (one was 580 jin, and the other was 501.5 jin). Based on existing experience, the county party committee and the masses jointly analyzed and believed that the level of rapeseed yield depends on the number of branches, the number of pods, the number of grains, and the weight of the seeds. Rapeseed is an indeterminate inflorescence crop. As long as we firmly grasp the key periods such as seedling, budding, bolting, flowering, and pod-setting, and implement large amounts of fertilizer and water, frequent application, and frequent irrigation, we can increase branches, increase pods, increase grains, and increase yields. At present, rapeseed growth is entering the bolting stage, which is a favorable opportunity to promote branching. Sufficient fertilizer and water supply during this period can not only greatly increase branching, but also lay a good foundation for increasing pods and grains later.

Prior to this, in order to win high rapeseed yields, all people's communes in Xindu County had conscientiously implemented various high-yield policies, appropriately advanced the sowing season, and greatly increased the planting of "Rapeseed King." Under the leadership of "Rapeseed King," especially since the Provincial Party Committee held the on-site rapeseed field management meeting in Xindu County, the enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members has been even higher and the management has been more detailed. More than 50,000 mu of rapeseed in the county have basically achieved no pests and diseases, no missing seedlings, and no third-class seedlings, and have entered the seedling stage normally. The earlier planted (approximately 60%) have generally begun the seedling stage, and the later planted are also in the process of or about to begin the seedling stage. However, a small number of cadres and the masses have therefore developed complacency and paralysis. In response to this idea, the county party committee, considering that there is still potential to be tapped from increasing rapeseed branches, pods, and grains to achieve even higher yields, clearly put forward the slogan of vigorously developing rapeseed "Three Increases and One Weight" and asked everyone to further strengthen rapeseed field management. In order to lead the rapeseed "Three Increases and One Weight" campaign well, the party secretaries of counties, districts, communes, and management areas have personally taken charge, assigned areas and contracted tasks, and led the masses to carry out field management.

Boosting enthusiasm and promoting the rapeseed "Three Increases and One Weight" campaign is a distinctive feature of the field management campaign in Xindu County. Before the start of the campaign, many communes in the county held oath-taking rallies of thousands and tens of thousands of people. After the campaign was launched, people came in the wind and went in the rain, and many commune members voluntarily gave up their Spring Festival holidays. The number of people participating in manure accumulation increased rapidly from more than 10,000 to 27,000. The interval between top dressing for rapeseed in each commune has generally been shortened from once every ten and a half days to once every five to seven days. The amount of manure applied each time has also increased from 20 to 30 loads per mu to 40 to 50 loads. In the seven or eight days after the Spring Festival, each commune generally seized the time to apply one to two top dressings to increase branching, and also combined it with irrigation. Each commune has newly established more than 500 rapeseed medical teams, which patrol the fields regularly and treat insects as soon as they are found. The county has introduced more than 7,000 buckets of bee colonies from other places, plus the original ones in the county, there are a total of more than 20,000 buckets of bee colonies, with an average of more than two mu of rapeseed field per bucket of bee colony. Up to now, the number of branches per rapeseed plant has generally increased by two to three, and in the 500 mu of rapeseed in the fifth cultivation area of Guihu Commune, it has increased by six to seven. Now, the rapeseed in the county generally has 15 to 20 branches per plant, an increase of six to seven compared with the same period last year.

    增枝增荚增粒重  油菜产量登高峰
    新都以水肥为中心开展“三增一重”运动
    促使油菜“三增一重”的四项办法
    新都县开展油菜增枝、增荚、增粒、粒重的“三增一重”运动，具体措施有以下四点：
    一、增施肥料。油菜是一种需肥较多的作物，根据它的生长特点，要增枝、增荚、增粒，必须重施开盘、抽苔肥，狠施初花肥。从开盘到初花，每五至七天追肥一次，共追肥四次以上，每次每亩施优质水粪三十至四十挑，并搭配一些磷肥和油枯、化学肥等精肥。各种肥料配合的比例是：氮40％，磷30％，钾30％。不同时期施肥各有重点：开盘期以速效氮肥为主，抽苔和开花期应多配合磷钾肥，在油菜谢花时，还要连续施二至三次根外追肥（每亩用硫酸铵一斤，过磷酸钙兑水二百至三百斤）。
    二、合理浸灌。油菜也是一种需水较多的作物，特别是胜利油菜，从开盘到开花这个阶段，必须有足够的水分供给才能高产。今年又有春旱现象，更要注意合理浸灌。从开盘到开花结荚这段时间，最好灌水三次：第一次在抽苔期，第二次在开花期，第三次在谢花期。灌水的方法，必须是开厢浸灌，以免土壤板结，养分流失。
    三、蜜蜂授粉。油菜是一种异花授粉作物，增设蜂群辅助授粉，一般可增产8％—10％。
    四、彻底消灭病虫害。病虫害是油菜增产的大敌，必须严加防治。除了进行中耕松土、清洁田园等预防措施外，还要指派专人负责，天天检查，一经发现，立即突击扑灭。对菌核病，可用两分草灰、一分石灰混合施于油菜窝里的办法防治。对毒素病，可用喷石硫合剂和撒石灰、草木灰以及拔除病株的办法防治。此外，每半月喷射一次蒜水（大蒜一斤捶绒后泡水五十斤）；随时拣净黄脚叶，对防治各种病虫害也有很好的作用。
    本报讯　以油菜高产而负盛名的四川新都县，紧紧抓住当前油菜生长进入抽苔阶段和分枝的旺盛时期，以大肥大水全面猛攻的办法，开展了一个大搞油菜增枝、增荚、增粒、粒重的“三增一重”运动。
    油菜“三增一重”运动是中共新都县委从历年油菜高产经验中提炼出来的精华。去年，这个县清白江公社有一亩多油菜田，因为抓住了油菜从开盘到结荚这段期间，连续追施了八次速效肥，增施了一万九千多斤硝泥；同时逐次结合灌水，使其吃饱喝足，结果分枝、分荚、粒数都比一般田多得多，获得了亩产九百一十七斤的高额丰产纪录。前年，该县桂湖公社第一耕作区有两块被编为十九、二十号的油菜田，底肥、移栽期、密度都一样，苗期也同样都施了四次追肥、两次苔期肥和初花期肥，但是因为二十号田在开盘期中和初花期后又增施了两次追肥，结果二十号田就比十九号田的产量增加了七十八点五斤（一为五百八十斤、一为五百零一斤半）。根据已有经验，县委与群众一道研究分析认为：油菜产量的高低，取决于枝多、荚多、粒多、籽重。油菜是一种无限花序作物，只要狠狠抓住开盘、现蕾、抽苔、开花、结荚等关键时期，实行大肥大水，勤施勤灌，就能够增枝、增荚、增粒，提高产量。目前，油菜生长正进入抽苔阶段，是促进增枝的有利时机，这段时期的肥水供给充足，不仅能使分枝大量增加，而且也为以后增荚、增粒打好基础。
    在这以前，为了夺取油菜高产，新都县各人民公社就认真执行了多种高产的方针，适当提早了播种季节，并且大量增种了“油菜王”。在“油菜王”的带动下，特别是省委在新都县召开全省油菜田间管理现场会以来，广大社员干劲更高，管理更细，全县五万多亩油菜基本作到无病虫害、无缺窝、无三类苗，正常进入开盘阶段，栽种较早的（约占60％）已经普遍开盘，栽种较迟的也正在或即将开盘。可是少数干部和群众却因此产生了自满麻痹思想。针对这种思想，县委考虑到从油菜增枝、增荚、增粒等方面来挖潜力，还可以夺取更高的产量，便明确地提出了大搞油菜“三增一重”的口号，要求大家进一步加强油菜田间管理。为了领导好油菜“三增一重”运动，县、区、公社以及管理区的党委书记，都亲自上阵，划片包干，领导群众进行田间管理。
    大鼓干劲，促进油菜“三增一重”运动，是新都县进行田间管理运动中的鲜明特点。运动开始以前，全县许多公社都举行了千人、万人誓师大会。运动展开以后，人们风里来，雨里去，很多社员自动放弃了春节的休假。全县参加积肥的人数由原来一万多人迅速增加到二万七千人。各个公社普遍由原来每十天半月给油菜追一次肥，缩短到五至七天追一次肥。每次追施的粪水也由原来每亩二十至三十挑增加为四十至五十挑。在春节以后的七八天中，各社普遍抓紧时间给油菜追了一至二次增枝肥，同时结合进行了灌水。各公社新建立了五百多个油菜医疗队，经常在田间巡逻，见虫就治；全县从外地引进了七千多桶蜂群，加上本县原有的，共有蜂群二万多桶，平均每两亩多油菜田就有一桶蜂群。到目前为止，每株油菜的分枝，一般都新增加了二至三个，桂湖公社第五耕区的五百亩油菜，每株增加了六、七个。现在，全县的油菜一般每株都已有十五至二十个分枝，比去年同期增加了六至七个。
