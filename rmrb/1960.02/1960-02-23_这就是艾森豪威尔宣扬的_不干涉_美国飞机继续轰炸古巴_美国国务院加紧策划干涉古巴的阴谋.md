Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd dispatch from Havana: Following the exposure of the incident on the 18th where an American military pilot crashed while bombing a Cuban sugar mill, this crime of openly armed aggression against Cuba continues. Although the U.S. State Department made a formal "apology" to the Cuban government on the 19th through the U.S. Ambassador to Cuba.

According to the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces, on the morning of the 21st, a twin-engine bomber, clearly a U.S. B-25 type, intruded into the area east of Havana and dropped bombs near Prime Minister Castro's residence. One bomb exploded about two hundred meters from Castro's house.

Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd dispatch from Washington: The "New York Times" published a dispatch on the 18th from its special correspondent James Reston in Washington on the 17th, stating that the U.S. government has recently held a series of interdepartmental meetings to consider taking a tougher policy towards the Castro government in Cuba. According to Reston, one of the new measures the U.S. government will use to deal with Cuba is to win over other Latin American countries to "isolate" Cuba in the Western Hemisphere. He said, "President Eisenhower will discuss this issue during his visit to Latin America next week."

The report said that Assistant Secretary of State Rubottom also held "two secret meetings with American business leaders in Washington and New York on the 16th and 17th to discuss the Cuban government's expropriation of American property and anti-American policies of Cuban banks." A series of interdepartmental meetings also discussed "the implications of the recent political and economic agreements signed between Cuba and the Soviet Union."

In addition to trying to "isolate" Cuba, Reston revealed that the measures the U.S. government will take to deal with Cuba also include redrafting the U.S. Sugar Act. The news said that U.S. State Department and Agriculture Department officials discussed the draft bill with the House Agriculture Committee on the 17th, and it is expected that the draft of the new bill will be submitted to Congress soon. At the same time, Washington is also discussing imposing an import tax of one and a quarter U.S. cents per pound on Cuban sugar.

In addition, the news said that "as quickly as possible," a "powerful medium-wave radio station" will be established near Key West in Florida, or in Puerto Rico, dedicated to propaganda aimed at subverting the Cuban revolutionary government.

Xinhua News Agency, dispatch from Buenos Aires: The Argentine newspaper "Clarin" published an article by American journalist Joseph Newman on the 19th, stating that the primary problem for the U.S. in Latin America is to "win political support" to prevent the influence of the Cuban revolution from "expanding to other areas of this hemisphere." Eisenhower is attempting to seek "multilateral collective action" during his visit to impose "economic and political sanctions" on Cuba.

    这就是艾森豪威尔宣扬的“不干涉”
    美国飞机继续轰炸古巴
    美国国务院加紧策划干涉古巴的阴谋
    新华社22日讯　哈瓦那消息：美国军人驾驶的飞机18日因轰炸古巴的糖厂而坠毁的事件被揭发以后，这种公开武装侵略古巴的罪行仍然在继续进行。虽然美国国务院曾在19日通过美国驻古巴大使向古巴政府作了正式的“道歉”。
    据古巴革命武装部宣布，21日清晨有一架双引擎的显然是美国B—25型的轰炸机入侵哈瓦那以东的地区，并在卡斯特罗总理的官邸附近投下炸弹。有一颗炸弹在距离卡斯特罗的房屋约二百米的地方爆炸。
    新华社22日讯　华盛顿消息：“纽约时报”18日刊载了它的特派记者詹姆斯·赖斯顿17日从华盛顿发出的电讯说，最近，美国政府举行了一连串的各部门之间的会议，考虑对古巴卡斯特罗政府采取更强硬的政策。据赖斯顿透露，美国政府用以对付古巴的新措施之一将是拉拢拉丁美洲其他国家，在西半球“孤立”古巴，他说，“艾森豪威尔总统在他下周访问拉丁美洲时将讨论这个问题”。
    报道说，美国助理国务卿鲁博特姆还曾在16日和17日先后“在华盛顿和纽约同美国企业界领袖举行了两次秘密会议，就古巴政府汲取美国财产和古巴银行的反美政策事进行协商”。一连串的各部门间的会议还讨论了“古巴和苏联新近签订的政治和经济协定的含义”。
    除了设法“孤立”古巴外，赖斯顿透露的美国政府将采取的对付古巴的办法还包括重新草拟美国的食糖法。消息说，美国国务院和农业部官员17日和众议院农业委员会讨论了草拟中的法案，预料不久就会把新法案的草案送交国会。同时，华盛顿也在讨论对古巴食糖每磅征收美元一又四分之一分的进口税的作法。
    此外，消息说，“将尽可能快地”在美国佛罗里达州的基麦斯特附近，或在波多黎各建立一座“强有力中波广播电台”，专事旨在颠复古巴革命政府的宣传。
    据新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯电　阿根廷“号角报”19日刊载美国记者约瑟夫·纽曼的一篇文章说，美国在拉丁美洲的首要的问题是“争取政治支持”来防止古巴革命的影响“扩大到本半球的其他地区”。艾森豪威尔企图在访问中寻求“多边的集体行动”，来对古巴实行“经济和政治制裁”。（附图片）
