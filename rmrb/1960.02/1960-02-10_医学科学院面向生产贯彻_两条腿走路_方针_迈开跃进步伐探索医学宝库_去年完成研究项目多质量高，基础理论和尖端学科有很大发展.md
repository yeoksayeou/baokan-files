    The Academy of Medical Sciences Implements "Walking on Two Legs" Policy Facing Production
    Taking Leaps Forward to Explore the Treasure Trove of Medicine
    Completing Many High-Quality Research Projects Last Year, with Great Development in Basic Theory and Cutting-Edge Disciplines
    (Our newspaper dispatch) On the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the research work of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences achieved a continued Great Leap Forward along the socialist road in 1959 under the leadership of the Party. The entire academy had a total of 945 repeatedly revised scientific research topics. By the end of 1959, the number of completed topics accounted for 96.3% of the total. Some of the targets originally scheduled to be completed in 1960 were broken through by the end of 1959 through the efforts of the masses. Some of the unfinished topics were due to difficulties in working conditions; a very few units failed to complete all of them due to insufficient subjective efforts.
    Through basic summary of the Great Leap Forward experience in 1958 and a comprehensive inspection of research work launched by the masses in June 1959, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences further implemented the "walking on two legs" policy in scientific research, making the research plan more practical and preparing the conditions for continued leaps forward. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, a leaping forward situation appeared in the scientific research work of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences with one effort after another, one upsurge after another. Many units further mobilized the masses to carefully calculate accounts, added many new research topics, and greatly improved the original targets.
    Over the past year, remarkable achievements have been made in serving production and construction by facing production. Most of the research technicians in many units went deep into areas with severe epidemics and difficult living conditions to carry out disease elimination and scientific research. For example, the Institute of Parasitic Diseases moved the base for clinical treatment research of schistosomiasis from large cities and large hospitals to rural areas with severe epidemics. The number of patients treated in the past year has increased from 50 to 100 to more than 1,800; at the same time, it has summarized the treatment experience of eliminating ascites and improving physical signs in advanced schistosomiasis, so that advanced patients who were once considered hopeless have returned to the labor front from the edge of death. For example, more than 40 research technicians from the Institute of Dermatology and Venereology went to eight provinces to carry out research on the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases and leprosy. In cooperation with relevant units, they screened sexually transmitted diseases and leprosy patients among more than 2.2 million people in 1959, helped local areas establish five prevention and treatment centers, and trained more than 2,200 intermediate and primary prevention and treatment cadres. While carrying out the above-mentioned prevention and treatment work, they also wrote more than 100 research reports and explored a complete set of experiences in eliminating sexually transmitted diseases.
    In the research of drugs, antibiotics, etc., many projects have moved from pharmacological experimental treatment to clinical trials, and from the laboratory to intermediate trials in the past year, and some have been put into production. For example, the research on the domestically produced antihypertensive drug "Jiangyaling" has completely solved the problems from separation and extraction to large-scale production, from pharmacology to clinical application, providing a powerful weapon for the prevention and treatment of hypertension, and saving a lot of foreign exchange.
    Under the direction of serving socialist construction, great progress has also been made in basic medical theory and cutting-edge disciplines. For example, in connection with the task of preventing and treating hypertension, research has been conducted on the role of mental and neurological factors and neurohumoral factors in the various important links in the pathogenesis of hypertension, and it has been initially clarified; in connection with the task of conquering tumors, achievements have been made in the immunity of malignant tumors, the culture of human malignant cells, the laws and characteristics of carcinogenesis, and the etiology of cervical cancer. In the field of cutting-edge disciplines, a total of 72 open-heart surgeries have been performed in the past year (four times that of 1958), and the surgical mortality rate is lower than that of foreign countries, including a complex "Tetralogy of Fallot" operation.
    New achievements have been made in studying and sorting out traditional Chinese medicine using modern scientific methods in the past year. For example, the research on the essence of meridians has initially clarified that the meridian theory of traditional Chinese medicine has its physiological basis, and found some ways to explore the treasure house of traditional Chinese medicine. In clinical practice, the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine or the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine on diseases such as liver cirrhosis ascites, pregnancy poisoning, and aplastic anemia, Zigung pills on cervical erosion, subcutaneous indwelling needles on asthma, and acupuncture treatment of appendicitis have been summarized and affirmed. Detailed observation and examination were carried out, some rules were summarized, and the cure rate of the above-mentioned diseases was improved.
    The above are some of the achievements in the scientific research work of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences in the past year. These achievements show that as long as we strengthen the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously carry out mass movements, and adhere to the policy of "walking on two legs," medical science can develop at a high speed.

### 医学科学院面向生产贯彻“两条腿走路”方针  迈开跃进步伐探索医学宝库  去年完成研究项目多质量高，基础理论和尖端学科有很大发展

    医学科学院面向生产贯彻“两条腿走路”方针
    迈开跃进步伐探索医学宝库
    去年完成研究项目多质量高，基础理论和尖端学科有很大发展
    本报讯　在1958年大跃进的基础上，1959年中国医学科学院的研究工作在党的领导下，沿着社会主义道路实现了继续大跃进。全院经一再修订的科学研究计划共有九百四十五个题目，到1959年底已完成的题目占总题目数的96．3％。其中有些原订1960年完成的指标，经过群众的努力，在1959年底就突破了。没有完成的题目中有一部分是由于工作条件上的困难；也有极个别单位因主观努力不够而未能全部完成。
    中国医学科学院通过对1958年大跃进经验的基本总结，和1959年6月份发动群众对研究工作进行的全面大检查，更进一步贯彻了科学研究工作中两条腿走路的方针，使研究计划更为落实，为继续跃进准备了条件。党的八届八中全会以后，中国医学科学院科学研究工作出现了干劲一鼓再鼓，一个高潮接着一个高潮的跃进局面。许多单位进一步发动群众算细账，增加了很多新的研究题目，大大提高了原订的指标。
    一年以来，在面向生产为生产建设服务方面做出了显著的成绩。许多单位大部分的研究技术人员深入到疫情严重、生活艰苦的地区去开展除害灭病和科学研究工作。如寄生虫病研究所把血吸虫病临床治疗研究的基地由大城市大医院移到疫情严重的农村，一年来治疗的病人由过去的五十到一百例，提高到一千八百多例；同时总结出消除晚期血吸虫病腹水和改善体征的治疗经验，使一向认为回春乏术的晚期病人，从死亡的边缘回到了劳动战线。又如皮肤性病所分赴八个省开展性病麻疯防治研究工作的四十多名研究技术人员，同有关单位协作，在1959年内普查了二百二十多万人口中的性病麻疯患者，帮助地方建立五个防治所，并培养中、初级防治干部二千二百多名。在进行上述防治工作的同时，还写成了研究工作报告一百多篇，摸索出成套的消灭性病的经验。
    药物、抗菌素等的研究，一年来许多项目已经从药理实验治疗走向临床试用，从实验室走向中间试制，部分投入了生产。如国产降压药“降压灵”的研究，已成套地解决了从分离提取到大规模生产，从药理到临床应用的问题，为高血压防治工作提供了有力的武器，而且大量节约了外汇。
    在为社会主义建设服务的方向下，在医学基础理论和尖端学科方面，也有了很大的发展。如结合着防治高血压的任务，对精神神经因素和神经体液因素在高血压发病中各个重要环节进行了研究，并已初步阐明；结合着制服肿瘤的任务，在恶性肿瘤的免疫、人体恶性细胞培养、癌变的规律和特点、宫颈癌的病因等方面都做出了成绩。在尖端学科方面，心内直视手术一年来共进行七十二次（为1958年的四倍），手术死亡率已低于国外，其中包括一例复杂的“法鲁氏四联症”手术。
    用现代科学方法研究整理祖国医学，一年来有了新的成就。如经络本质的研究，已初步阐明了祖国医学的经络学说有其生理基础，找出了探索祖国医学宝库的一些途径。在临床上总结并肯定了中医中药或中西结合对肝硬变腹水、妊娠中毒、再生障碍性贫血等疾病，子宫丸对宫颈糜烂，皮下留针对哮喘，针灸治疗阑尾炎等的疗效，进行了较细致的观察检查，总结了一些规律，提高了对上述疾病的治愈率。
    以上是一年来中国医学科学院科学研究工作上的一部分成绩。这些成绩说明，只要加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，坚持贯彻两条腿走路的方针，医学科学是可以高速度发展的。　（周北凡）
