Editor's Notes:

    Persevere
    Yesterday, we published news about the Ministry of Coal Industry and the Henan Provincial Construction Department summarizing and enhancing the innovations made by the masses in the technical innovation movement, systematizing advanced experiences. Comrade Wang Pu wrote a short article titled "Concentrate It," pointing out the significance of this approach for high-speed development of production. Today, we are recommending to our readers the experience of the Pangjiabu Iron Mine in institutionalizing the method of summarizing technical innovation achievements. This experience is an important supplement to the practices of the Ministry of Coal Industry and Henan Province yesterday. With yesterday's "Concentrate It" and today's "Persevere," we have formed a complete method for leading the technical innovation movement.
    We hope everyone will learn from the Pangjiabu Iron Mine's practice: persevere with the technical innovation achievements that have been concentrated, so that the level of advanced producers becomes the level of the entire enterprise and the entire society. Persevere with the leadership method of "Concentrate It, Persevere," so that the technical innovation and technical revolution movement constantly surges to new peaks, wave after wave!

    坚持下去
    昨天我们发表了煤炭部和河南省建筑部门总结、提高群众在技术革新运动中的创造，使先进经验系统化的消息。王朴同志写了一篇“集中起来”的短文，指出了这种做法对高速度发展生产的意义。今天，我们又要向读者推荐庞家堡铁矿把总结技术革新成果的方法制度化的经验。这个经验是对于昨天煤炭部和河南省的做法的一个重要补充。有了昨天的“集中起来”，再加上今天的“坚持下去”，这就形成了一种完整的领导技术革新运动的方法。
    我们希望大家都学习庞家堡铁矿的做法：把集中起来的技术革新成果坚持下去，使先进生产者的水平变成全企业、全社会的水平。把“集中起来、坚持下去”的领导方法坚持下去，使技术革新和技术革命运动一浪高一浪地不断涌向新的高峰！
