    Polish People's Artistic Treasure
    ——After Watching the Performance of the Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble
    Jia Zuoguang
    We watched the outstanding performance of the Polish People's Republic's Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble in the magnificent Great Hall of the People with great excitement. Each of their programs tightly grasped the audience's heartstrings, leading people into a poetic realm. The Polish artists' singing and dancing fully demonstrated the excellent tradition of Polish folk song and dance art, as well as the wisdom and amazing talent of the Polish people.
    The late Tadeusz Sygietyński, the founder of the Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble, was an outstanding composer. He and his wife, the distinguished actress Mira Zimińska, fully developed and innovated the excellent musical and dance traditions most loved by the Polish people, closely linking them with the working people, thus more strongly reflecting the Polish people's socialist construction thoughts, feelings, and revolutionary optimism.
    Their performance began with the Polonaise dance "Turn, Turn." This was a dance expressing congratulations, and it warmly expressed the Polish people's friendship towards the Chinese people, making us feel the happiness of friendship.
    Following the greetings, the girls and boys danced the Tramblanka-Polka song and dance from Wolbórz, which is very popular among the Polish people, leaving us with a beautiful impression. The light and graceful dance postures, the energetic and unique national style of dance movements, and the lyrical and unique tones moved us. The Oberek dance from Wolbórz is very humorous: the girls narrate their ideals, preferring to marry a poor young man rather than a rich one. This simple and cheerful character dance brought us great pleasure.
    In the brisk and lively Lublin Waltz, the performance of the heroes in black holding the girls and turning and leaping was very humorous. The songs and dances of the Wielkopolska region and the Little Krakowiak dance, which aroused people's interest, were full of pastoral flavor. Coupled with the special timbre of the rural band, the goat-like tremolo added a strong local flavor, allowing the audience to feel the joy of the Polish people's rural festivals from these songs and dances.
    The distinctly individual dances of the Warmia and Masuria regions have the style of Polish puppet shows. When the rural band accompanied, they added the "Devil's Violin" (an ancient instrument). This peculiar instrument played a special effect, and the actors' repeated performances gave the audience great satisfaction. In the dances of the mountain residents, which have strong rhythms and are unique, the enthusiastic duet and collective dance whistles and shouts showed a strong working atmosphere, expressing the strong character of the mountain residents. The famous Polonaise is a dance from the Łowicz region. Girls in white纱 skirts and young men in black礼服 danced lightly and gracefully in pairs, elegant and beautiful. The song and dance ensemble's performance ended with the cheerful and spectacular Mazur dance, and the grand scene of this dance brought the entire evening to a climax.
    The performance of the Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble fully demonstrated the distinct and rich national characteristics of Polish folk song and dance. At the same time, we can also understand the different characteristics of the people in various regions from the colorful costumes of the dances in various regions. In the performance, the excellent band performance and folk songs added to the charm of the dance. Their originality and innovation, and good experience in inheriting and promoting national folk songs and dances, gave us a good learning opportunity.
    The artistic achievements of the Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble fully demonstrate the Polish United Workers' Party's unparalleled attention and care for the song and dance art of the Polish people. It is an immortal cultural treasure created by the Polish people. This is not only the pride of the Polish people, but also brings the greatest artistic enjoyment to peace-loving people all over the world. They will forever radiate brilliant brilliance in the treasure house of world progressive human culture and art. We warmly congratulate all the artists of the Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble on their great success in their visit to China!

    波兰人民的艺术珍宝
    ——玛佐夫舍歌舞团演出观后
    贾作光
    我们以极其兴奋的心情，在金碧辉煌的人民大会堂里欣赏了波兰人民共和国玛佐夫舍歌舞团杰出的表演。他们的每个节目都紧紧地扣住观众的心弦，把人们引向诗一样的境界。波兰艺术家们载歌载舞的表演充分地显示了波兰民间歌舞艺术的优秀传统，以及波兰人民的智慧和惊人的才华。
    已故的玛佐夫舍歌舞团的创始人塔乌什·塞格廷斯基是一位杰出的作曲家，他和他的夫人、卓越的演员米拉·齐明斯卡娅把波兰人民最喜爱的优秀音乐舞蹈传统加以充分的发展和革新，使它们紧密地和劳动人民联系在一起，从而更加强烈地反映了波兰人民建设社会主义的思想情感和革命的乐观主义精神。
    他们的演出是从波洛涅兹舞“转呀转”开始的。这是一个表示祝贺的舞蹈，它亲切地表现了波兰人民对中国人民的友谊，使我们感受到友谊的幸福。
    随着问候，姑娘们和小伙子跳起了波兰人民喜闻乐见的沃波奇诺的特拉姆勃良卡——波尔卡歌舞，给我们留下了美好的印象。那轻巧优美的舞姿，富有活力的独特民族风格的舞蹈动作和抒情别致的声调，激动着我们。沃波奇诺的奥别列克舞是很幽默的：姑娘们叙述了她们的理想，宁愿嫁给一个穷小子，也不嫁给有钱的人。这种纯朴开朗的性格舞带给我们很大的愉快。
    在轻快、活泼的华尔兹卢布林舞中，着黑衣的英雄们抱着女孩子回转跳跃的表演是很有风趣的。引起人们兴致的韦尔科波尔斯基地区的歌舞和小克拉科维亚克舞，充满了田园的风味。加上农村乐队奏出的特殊音色，那山羊鸣叫般的颤音，更增添了浓郁的乡土风味，使观众从这些歌舞中感受到了波兰人民农村节日的快乐。
    个性鲜明的瓦尔米亚和马祖雷地区的舞蹈，有着波兰木偶剧般的风格。农村乐队伴奏时，加入了“魔鬼的小提琴”（一种古老的乐器）。这种奇特的乐器奏出一种特殊的效果，演员一次一次的表演使观众得到很大的满足。有着强烈节奏、别具一格的山地居民的舞蹈中，热烈的双人舞和集体舞的口哨呼叫显出了浓烈的劳动气息，表现了山地居民强悍的性格。著名的波洛涅兹是罗维奇地区的舞蹈。身罩白纱裙的女郎和身穿黑礼服的青年对对成双地轻歌漫舞，典雅而又优美。歌舞团的演出晚会是以欢快而又壮观的马组尔舞作为结束的，这个舞蹈的宏大场面使得整个晚会达到最高峰。
    玛佐夫舍歌舞团的表演，充分地显示了波兰民间歌舞鲜明而又浓郁的民族特色。同时，我们从色彩缤纷的各地区舞蹈的服装中，也能了解到各地区人民不同的特点。在演出中，出色的乐队演奏和民间歌曲更增加了舞蹈的魅力。他们这种独创和革新，继承和发扬民族民间歌舞的良好经验给了我们一个很好的学习机会。
    玛佐夫舍歌舞团的艺术成就，充分表明了波兰统一工人党对波兰人民的歌舞艺术无比的重视和关怀。它是波兰人民所创造的不朽的文化财富。这不仅是波兰人民自己的骄傲，也带给世界上爱好和平的人民最大的艺术享受。它们在世界进步人类文化艺术的宝库中将永远放射出绚丽的光彩。我们热烈地祝贺玛佐夫舍歌舞团全体艺术家们在中国访问演出获得巨大的成功！
