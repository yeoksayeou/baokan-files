Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 25th: The Italian Christian Democratic Segni government submitted its resignation to President Gronchi last night.

The Segni government pursued a policy of allowing the United States to establish missile bases in Italy and conducting the "Cold War" externally, while internally it strived to enable monopoly capital—the clerical faction—to monopolize political, economic, and social life. This aroused great dissatisfaction among the Italian people, making the already unstable rule of the Christian Democratic Party even more precarious. Under these circumstances, the "left" wing within the Christian Democratic Party advocated slightly changing the government's current policies in order to alleviate popular dissatisfaction. At the same time, they also advocated drawing in Nenni's Socialist Party, attempting to induce the Socialist Party to participate in the government, or at least maintain "benevolent neutrality" in parliament, in order to improve the situation of the Christian Democratic government.

However, the right-wing forces inside and outside the Christian Democratic Party opposed the above approach. The Liberal Party even pressured the Christian Democratic Party by withdrawing its support for the Segni government. The Segni government then announced its resignation.

    意塞尼政府辞职
    据新华社25日讯　罗马消息：意大利天主教民主党塞尼政府昨天晚上向总统格隆基提出辞职。
    塞尼政府对外执行让美国在意大利建立导弹基地和进行“冷战”的政策，对内则竭力使垄断资本——教权派垄断政治、经济和社会生活。这引起了意大利人民的极大不满，使本来已经不稳的天主教民主党的统治更加不稳。在这种情况下，天主教民主党内的“左”派就主张稍为改变一下政府的现行政策，以便缓和人民的不满情绪。同时，他们还主张拉拢南尼的社会党，企图诱使社会党参加政府，或者至少在议会保持“善意的中立”，以改善天主教民主党政府的处境。
    但是，天主教民主党内外的右翼力量都反对上述这种作法。自由党甚至以撤回它对塞尼政府的支持来向天主教民主党施加压力。塞尼政府于是宣告辞职。
