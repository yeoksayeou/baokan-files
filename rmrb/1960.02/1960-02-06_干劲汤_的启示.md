Inspiration from "Drive Soup"
Wu Lü

Besides selling several inexpensive dishes suitable for the needs of the migrant workers, the dining section of the "Follow-the-Army Supply Service Station" also offered stewed *bobo* (a kind of wheat cake) for the migrant workers, charging only two cents per serving; white cabbage soup was sold for one cent a bowl, free for those who had no money, and dried rations were baked for free. The migrant workers worked in shifts day and night, so they operated day and night, ensuring that the migrant workers could get hot soup and meals. Because it was cheap, delicious, and the service was attentive, it was deeply welcomed by the migrant workers. The migrant workers gave the white cabbage soup a name, calling it "Drive Soup," saying "Delicious and cheap, warming the hearts, drinking it increases drive tenfold."

An elderly migrant worker, Liu Desen, came to the sewing and washing team to mend his cotton pants. Liu Xiuqing, a member of the Communist Youth League, saw that the waistband of the old man's pants was badly torn, and he would not be able to work if it was not repaired. However, at that time, the service station had just been established, and the cloth for mending clothes had not yet been delivered. She tore her own shirt and repaired the cotton pants. Liu Desen was extremely moved... The migrant worker team Liu Desen belonged to seized this incident to conduct education, greatly stimulating the migrant workers' drive. The headquarters gave them a two-day task, which they completed in one day. Someone asked the captain: "Why is your drive so strong?" The captain said: "This is all boosted by a small shirt of Comrade Liu Xiuqing!"

The above two paragraphs are excerpted from the news about the commercial employees at the Eight-Hole Sluice water conservancy project site in Wuqing County, Tianjin, doing everything possible to serve the migrant workers. The deeds introduced in this news can be said to be touching and worth reading and pondering deeply.

A one-cent bowl of white cabbage soup and mending a pair of torn cotton pants seem to be very small things. However, these small things have had a big impact: they have boosted the morale of the masses. Isn't this worth pondering deeply?

The commercial employees of the "Follow-the-Army Supply Service Station" at the Eight-Hole Sluice water conservancy project site can do commercial work so well and produce such a huge political impact. It seems that the most important reason is that they closely combine economic work with political work. In their view, commercial work not only has rich economic content, but also rich political content; it is not just buying and selling, doing the work of goods, purchasing, inventorying, selling, etc., but also political work, the work of people, to care for people, to be considerate of people, and to help people. Therefore, in their eyes, every business item, every transaction, even mending a pair of torn cotton pants and selling a bowl of white cabbage soup are not simple small things, but big things with political significance. They inject their high political consciousness and noble communist style into every piece of their daily work, which makes every piece of their work produce a strong political influence, shining with touching ideological brilliance. If all commercial workers want to do their work as well as the "Follow-the-Army Supply Service Station" at the Eight-Hole Sluice water conservancy project site, they must first deeply understand the political significance of economic work like the commercial employees at the Eight-Hole Sluice water conservancy project site.

In fact, those who can learn from the model deeds of the "Follow-the-Army Supply Service Station" at the Eight-Hole Sluice water conservancy project site are not limited to commercial workers? All comrades who do economic work can learn the most important lesson from them: how to understand the relationship between economic work and political work. Some of our comrades who do economic work often only talk about economics and not politics; they only talk about objective economic laws and not the subjective initiative of people, so their work is always not done well. If these comrades can be inspired by the communist style of the commercial workers at the Eight-Hole Sluice water conservancy project site and learn this style, they will do their work better.

    “干劲汤”的启示
    吴滤
    “随军供应服务站”的饮食部除了出卖几种适合民工需要的廉价菜以外，还代民工烩饽饽，烩一次只收两分钱；出卖白菜汤，一分钱一碗，没有钱的免费，代烤干粮，一律不收费。民工日夜轮班干活，他们就日夜营业，保证使民工能吃上热汤热饭。由于价廉味美，服务周到，深受民工欢迎。民工给白菜汤起了一个名，叫“干劲汤”，说是“味美价廉暖人心，喝了干劲增十分”。
    一个老年民工刘德森来找缝洗组给补棉裤，共青团员刘秀清看到这个老大爷的裤腰破得很厉害，再不补就没法劳动了。可是，当时服务站刚成立，补衣服的布还没有拿来，她就把自己的衬衣撕了，把棉裤补好。刘德森感动得不得了……刘德森所在的那个民工队，抓住这件事进行教育，大大激发了民工的干劲。指挥部交给他们两天的任务，一天就干完了。有人问队长：“你们的干劲为什么这样足？”队长说：“这都是刘秀清同志的一件小褂给鼓起来的！”
    以上这两段，都是从天津市武清县八孔闸水利工程工地上的商业职工千方百计为民工服务的新闻中摘出来的。这篇新闻介绍的事迹，真可说是感人肺腑，很值得一读，很值得深思。
    一分钱一碗的白菜汤，补一条破棉裤，看起来都是很小的小事情。然而，这小事情却发生了大作用：它把群众的干劲鼓起来了。这不是很值得深思的吗？
    八孔闸水利工程工地“随军供应服务站”的商业职工，能把商业工作做得这样出色，产生了这样巨大的政治影响，看起来，一条最重要的原因是，他们把经济工作同政治工作密切结合起来了。在他们看来，商业工作不只有丰富的经济内容，而且有丰富的政治内容；不只是买买卖卖，做货的工作，进货、盘货、售货等等，而且是政治工作，是人的工作，要关心人、体贴人、帮助人。因而在他们那里，每一个经营项目，每一笔买卖，甚至补一件破棉裤，卖一碗白菜汤，都不是一件简单的小事情，而是具有政治意义的大事情。他们把自己高度的政治觉悟和崇高的共产主义风格，注射到日常的每一件工作中去，这就使他们的每一件工作都产生强烈的政治影响，闪烁着感人的思想光辉。一切商业工作者要把自己的工作做得像八孔闸水利工程工地“随军供应服务站”那样出色，首先就要像八孔闸水利工程工地的商业职工那样深刻地认识经济工作的政治意义。
    其实，可以从八孔闸水利工程工地“随军供应服务站”的模范事迹中学到东西的，岂只限于商业工作者？一切做经济工作的同志，都可以从他们那里学到最重要的一课：怎样认识经济工作和政治工作的关系。我们有些做经济工作的同志，常常是只谈经济，不谈政治；只谈客观经济规律，不谈人的主观能动性，因而他们的工作总是搞不好。这些同志如果能从八孔闸水利工程工地商业工作者的共产主义风格方面得到启示，学习这种作风，那就会把工作作得好些。
