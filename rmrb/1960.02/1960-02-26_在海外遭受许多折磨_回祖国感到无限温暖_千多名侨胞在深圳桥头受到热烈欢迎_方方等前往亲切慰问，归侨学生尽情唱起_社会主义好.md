Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 25th. Another 1,200-plus overseas Chinese compatriots returned to the warm embrace of the motherland today. This is the fourth group of returning overseas Chinese to come back via Shenzhen this year. Among these returning overseas Chinese, with the exception of a very few who came from Singapore, the majority came from Indonesia.

As soon as the returning overseas Chinese arrived at the Shenzhen Bridge, they were warmly welcomed by relatives from the motherland. At 12:30 PM, the welcoming crowd beat drums and gongs and performed lion dances to greet their loved ones. The loudspeakers installed at the bridge played the moving song "Ode to the Motherland." The Shenzhen bridge was filled with the joyous atmosphere of family reunions. The welcoming crowd applauded and waved to the overseas Chinese from across the river, and the overseas Chinese waved back excitedly with handkerchiefs and newspapers. When the overseas Chinese crossed the Shenzhen Bridge, Fang Fang, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and Member of the Reception and Placement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China, stepped forward and warmly embraced Li Bocang, a returned overseas Chinese from Bandung, who was walking at the front. Li Bocang said excitedly: "I am so happy to be back in the motherland!" The welcoming crowd stood on the bridge, constantly shaking hands and exchanging greetings with the overseas Chinese. Many reception staff members were busy carrying luggage for the elderly and infirm overseas Chinese. Seventy-eight-year-old female returned overseas Chinese Lan Ruihua returned with her entire family of ten, and the reception staff helped her support the elderly and lead the young. The warmth of the motherland deeply moved her; her daughter and son-in-law were moved to tears.

Among those who came to Shenzhen today to welcome the returning overseas Chinese were Zhuang Xiquan, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and Member of the Reception and Placement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China; Huang Changshui and Zhuang Mingli, Deputy Directors of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission; Lian Guan, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Vice Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese; Hu Renshu, Deputy Director of the General Administration of Customs of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Member of the Reception and Placement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China; Zhang Zhuguo, Deputy Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Commerce and Member of the Reception and Placement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China; You Yangzu and Wang Yuanxing, Vice Chairmen of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese; Cai Zhongchang, Standing Committee Member; Yi Meihou, Chairman of the Guangdong Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese; Wang Hanjie, Director of the Fujian Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission; Guo Ruiren, Vice Chairman of the Fujian Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese; Lu Shaowu, Vice Chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region; Wu Yixiu and Li Mei, Members of the Reception and Placement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China, as well as responsible persons from the Bao'an County Party and government and people from all walks of life.

While the returning overseas Chinese were resting in the lounge, they happily ate and drank the pastries and tea prepared for them by the people of the motherland. Fang Fang had a cordial conversation with the returning overseas Chinese. He said that our overseas Chinese compatriots had done many beneficial things for the Indonesian people and nation, which we are proud of. However, the powerful groups in Indonesia, instigated by imperialism, have launched anti-China and anti-Chinese activities. The people of our motherland and all Indonesian overseas Chinese are indignant about this. He said that the powerful motherland welcomes overseas Chinese who have suffered persecution overseas and who do not wish to continue living overseas to return to the country to participate in socialist construction or study at any time. Fang Fang's speech was warmly applauded by the overseas Chinese compatriots.

In the evening, the returning overseas Chinese traveled by special train from Shenzhen to Guangzhou. Along the way, the returning overseas Chinese students sang songs such as "Socialism is Good" and "Ode to the Motherland" to their hearts' content on the train. When the train carrying the returning overseas Chinese arrived at Guangzhou East Railway Station, Tian Xin, Director of the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and representatives of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in Guangzhou warmly welcomed them at the station.

    在海外遭受许多折磨　回祖国感到无限温暖
    千多名侨胞在深圳桥头受到热烈欢迎
    方方等前往亲切慰问，归侨学生尽情唱起“社会主义好”
    新华社广州25日电　又有一千二百多名侨胞今天回到祖国温暖的怀抱。这是今年以来经深圳回来的第四批归国侨胞。在这批归国华侨中，除极少数是从新加坡回来的以外，都来自印度尼西亚。
    归侨们刚到达深圳桥头，便受到祖国亲人的热烈欢迎。中午十二时半，欢迎的人们敲着锣鼓，舞着狮子，迎接亲人。安装在桥头的广播器，播送出“歌唱祖国”的动人的歌声。深圳桥畔，充满着亲人团聚的欢乐气氛。欢迎的人们隔河向侨胞鼓掌和招手致意，侨胞们也兴奋地挥舞着手帕和报纸。当侨胞们越过深圳桥后，前来欢迎的华侨事务委员会副主任、中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会委员方方走上前去和走在最前面的万隆归侨李柏仓热烈地拥抱。李柏仓激动地说：“我能回到祖国太高兴啦！”欢迎的人们站在桥头上不断和侨胞们握手问好。许多接待人员忙着为老弱侨胞携带行李。七十八岁的女归侨兰瑞花一家十口都回来了，接待人员帮助她扶老携幼。祖国的温暖使她十分感动；她的女儿和女婿感动得流下泪来。
    今天到深圳欢迎归侨的，有华侨事务委员会副主任、中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会委员庄希泉，华侨事务委员会副主任黄长水、庄明理，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副秘书长、北京市归国华侨联合会副主席连贯，对外贸易部海关总署副署长、中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会委员胡仁沭，商业部办公厅副主任、中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会委员张柱国，中华人民共和国归国华侨联合会副主席尤扬祖、王源兴、常务委员蔡钟长，广东省归国华侨联合会主席蚁美厚，福建省华侨事务委员会主任王汉杰，福建省归国华侨联合会副主席郭瑞人，广西僮族自治区副主席卢绍武，中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会委员吴益修、李梅及宝安县党政负责人和各界人民。
    当归侨们在休息室休息的时候，都高高兴兴地吃喝着祖国人民为他们准备的糕点和茶水。方方和归侨们作了亲切的谈话。他说，我国侨胞曾经为印度尼西亚人民和民族作了许多有益的事情，这是我们感到光荣的。但是，印度尼西亚的有势力集团却在帝国主义的挑唆下，掀起了反华、排华活动。对此，我们祖国人民和所有的印度尼西亚华侨一样感到愤慨。他说，强大的祖国，随时都欢迎在海外遭受迫害和不愿意继续在海外居住的华侨回国参加社会主义建设或学习。方方的谈话，受到侨胞们的热烈鼓掌欢迎。
    晚上，归侨们乘坐专车，从深圳到达广州。沿途，归侨学生在车上尽情唱着“社会主义好”、“歌唱祖国”等歌曲。当归侨们乘坐的列车到达广州东站的时候，广东省华侨事务委员会主任田心和广州市的归国华侨、侨眷的代表，都到车站热烈欢迎。
