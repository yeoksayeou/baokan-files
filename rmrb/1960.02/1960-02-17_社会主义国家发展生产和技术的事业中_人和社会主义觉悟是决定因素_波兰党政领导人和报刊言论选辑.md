In the cause of developing production and technology in socialist countries
    People and socialist consciousness are the decisive factors
    —Selected speeches of Polish party and government leaders and newspaper comments
    People are the decisive factor in determining technological progress
    Those who overemphasize material incentives are wrong
    Comrades, money is not and cannot be the factor determining technological progress. People are the decisive factor. Technological progress cannot be bought with any amount of money. Those who overemphasize the significance of material incentives in this or other aspects are wrong. Money can buy people's labor, but it cannot buy their hearts, their dedication, their selfless sacrifice, their tenacity, and their enthusiasm. Money cannot make people consider issues from the perspective of the nation and the people, and it cannot cultivate a practical attitude toward social labor. And all of this plays a very important role in everyone's work. All these characteristics are particularly important in the work of developing our country's technological progress.

    The Soviet Union, which today ranks first in the world in many scientific and technological fields, surpassing capitalist countries including the United States, is an example of money not determining technological progress. The determining factor is socialism. The socialist system, which creates conditions conducive to the development of progress, cultivates people's awareness and their socialist attitude towards labor.

    The vast majority of our engineers and technical cadres have been trained and grown up in People's Poland. These cadres have demonstrated in thousands of examples their selflessness in labor, their high dedication, and their down-to-earth attitude towards the tasks assigned to them by the Party and the government. The Party relies on them as much as it relies on the older generation of engineering and technical cadres.
    (Gomulka's speech at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party, excerpted from the "People's Tribune" on January 24)
    It is precisely people's attitude and concern, and political work for people,
    that help complete the tasks of technological progress put forward by the Party
    It is essential to strengthen the leadership of Party organizations in the development of technology, because even with the best wishes and the best propaganda work, the tasks of technological progress will not be solved spontaneously. In order to complete the tasks in the field of technological progress, it is necessary to organize and lead daily affairs through Party organizations and administrative and technical organs.

    It should be emphasized that in every beginning in the development of technology, it is necessary to see and fully estimate the role of people—workers, technicians, and engineers—and it is precisely people's attitude and concern, as well as political work for people, that help complete the tasks put forward by the Fourth Plenary Session.
    (Speech by Jaroszewicz, Vice-Chairman of the Polish Council of Ministers, at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party, excerpted from the "People's Tribune" on January 24)
    Technological progress is a struggle between the new and the old
    The Party must lead it more systematically
    Under socialism, (technological) progress will not appear by itself; it is a struggle, a struggle between the new and the old. The Party must participate in this struggle and lead it in a more planned and organized manner, and the masses must participate in this struggle.

    If we can do this, then in the process of implementing the resolutions of this plenary session, we will have a completely different situation.
    (Speech by Ruminski, Deputy Minister of the Food Industry and Procurement of Poland, at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party, excerpted from the "People's Tribune" on January 24)
    The realization of the great task of developing technology depends first and foremost on people
    Breaking down conservatism is the task of all levels of Party organizations
    What determines whether Poland can smoothly realize the great task of developing technology is first and foremost people. Whether the beautiful program of modernized and bold technical ideas can be realized depends on the labor of our factory workers, especially on the efforts of engineers, technicians, designers, and rationalization proposers. The conclusion on the issue of material incentives as a means to accelerate technological progress is also developing in this direction. But it should not be forgotten, as Comrade Gomulka pointed out: "Money can buy people's labor, but it cannot buy their hearts, their dedication, their selfless sacrifice, their tenacity, and their enthusiasm." It is precisely this sense of pride, enthusiasm, and social consciousness of our engineers and technicians that guarantees their creative role in shaping our country's technological progress.

    Socialism, the Party, and progress are inseparable and interconnected concepts. Today, this progress must first be realized by making the fullest use of the achievements of technical ideas in the world and in Poland. Therefore, for every Party member, for every conscious worker, engineer, and technician, it is impossible to be indifferent to how the technical problems of his work post are solved and what assistance and care the pioneers of technical roads receive. Therefore, it is the task of all levels of our Party organizations and workers' autonomy to deeply analyze the technical situation in our factories, break down the obstacles and conservatism that the implementers of technical progress often encounter, and be the initiator and driving force of every progressive idea.
    (Excerpt from the January 25 editorial of the "People's Tribune": "A broad front of progress")
    Factors such as ideological encouragement, social consciousness, and understanding of the interests of the whole people
    influence the activities of hundreds of thousands of people—workers, technicians, and engineers
    Technological progress depends on the activities of hundreds of thousands of people—workers, technicians, engineers, economists, and scientific workers. In our country, in addition to material interests, the factors that influence their activities include ideological encouragement, professional pride and a high degree of social consciousness, interest in labor and faithful efforts, understanding of the interests of the whole people, and the atmosphere of creative labor in enterprises and institutions on which technological progress depends. Therefore, it is necessary to create such an atmosphere in enterprises and develop the understanding that technological progress creates conditions for safer and lighter labor, eliminates the gap between manual and mental labor, and ultimately has a decisive significance for the welfare and cultural level of the people.
              (Excerpt from the second issue of the Polish magazine "New Road" in 1960)
    If workers are not convinced that they are building a common edifice for themselves and future generations,
    socialist construction cannot have the speed and scale it should
    For several years, especially recently, the Third Plenary Session of the United Workers' Party and Party and economic activists have paid great attention to material incentives as the main factor in increasing labor productivity. This is undoubtedly correct, especially when labor quotas, wage rates, and bonuses need drastic and as quick as possible adjustment. However, it is also a mistake if the role of spiritual incentives is not seen or underestimated. Although enthusiasm alone is not enough to build socialism, if workers are not convinced that they are building a common, increasingly perfect edifice for themselves and their descendants, socialist construction cannot have the speed and scale it should. Therefore, political work and management systems are of great significance, as workers can thereby be attracted to participate in the process of preparing decisions, and collective thinking is the basis for decisions made by one person's leadership.

    Since the remuneration we give to labor is not yet as high as we would like, incentives of a spiritual nature are of great significance and can strengthen the belief in the justice of the socialist system.

    社会主义国家发展生产和技术的事业中
    人和社会主义觉悟是决定因素
    ——波兰党政领导人和报刊言论选辑
    人是决定技术进步的决定性因素
    过分看重物质鼓励的人是错误的
    同志们，钱不是和不可能是决定技术进步的因素。人才是决定因素。技术进步不能用任何钱来购买。那些过分看重物质鼓励在这方面或其他方面的意义的人是错误的。钱可以买到人的劳动，但是买不到他的心、事业心、忘我牺牲精神、顽强性和热情。钱不能使人从国家、人民的范畴来考虑问题，钱不能培养出他对社会劳动的切实态度。而这一切在每个人的劳动中起着非常重要的作用。所有这些特性在发展我们国家的技术进步的工作中是特别重要的。
    苏联，今天在许多科学和技术方面在世界范围内占首位，超过包括美国在内的资本主义国家，是钱不决定技术进步的例子。决定的因素是社会主义。创造促进进步发展条件的社会主义制度培养了人的觉悟，人的社会主义劳动态度。
    我们的工程师、技术干部绝大多数是在人民波兰中培养和成长起来的。这些干部以数以千计的例子表现了自己在劳动中的忘我精神、高度的事业心、对党和政府交给他们的任务的踏踏实实的态度。党像指望老一代的工程技术干部一样指望着他们。
    （哥穆尔卡在波兰统一工人党四中全会上的发言，摘自1月24日“人民论坛报”）
    正是人的态度和关心、对人的政治工作
    才有助于完成党提出的技术进步的任务
    在发展技术方面，加强党组织的领导作用十分必要，因为即使有最良好的愿望和最好的宣传工作，技术进步的任务不会自发地解决。为了完成技术进步领域里的任务，必须通过党组织以及行政和技术机关去组织和领导每天的事务。
    应该强调指出，在发展技术方面的每一个开端，都必须看到和充分估计人——工人、技师、工程师——的作用，而正是人的态度和关心，以及对人们的政治工作才有助于完成四中全会提出的任务。
    （波兰部长会议副主席雅罗谢维奇在波兰统一工人党四中全会上的发言，摘自1月24日“人民论坛报”）
    技术进步是一种新与旧的斗争
    党必须更加有计划地加以领导
    在社会主义条件下，（技术）进步是不会自己出现的，这是一种斗争，新与旧的斗争，党必须参加这一斗争，并更加有计划、有组织地加以领导，群众必须参加这一斗争。
    如果我们能作到这一点，那么在实现这次全会的决议的过程中，我们将会有完全不同的情况。
    （波兰食品工业和采购部副部长鲁明斯基在波兰统一工人党四中全会上的发言，摘自1月24日“人民论坛报”）
    实现发展技术的伟大任务首先取决于人
    打破保守主义是所有各级党组织的任务
    决定波兰是否能够顺利实现发展技术的伟大任务的首先是人。现代化的和大胆的技术思想的美好纲领是否能实现，取决于我们工厂职工的劳动，特别是取决于工程师、技师、设计师和合理化建议者的努力。在作为加速技术进步的手段的物质刺激问题上的结论，也是向这一方向发展的。但是不应该忘记哥穆尔卡同志所指出的：“钱可以买到人的劳动，但是买不到他的心、事业心、忘我牺牲精神、顽强性和热情。”正是我们的工程师和技师的这种自豪感、热情和社会觉悟，是他们在形成我国技术进步中的创造性作用的保证。
    社会主义、党和进步，这是不可分割的相互联系的概念。今天首先要通过最充分利用世界和波兰的技术思想成果来实现这种进步。因此对于每个党员，对于每个自觉的工人、工程师和技师来说，如何解决他所在的工作岗位的技术问题，技术道路的开拓者得到了什么帮助和关怀，不能漠不关心。因此深入地分析我们工厂中的技术状况，打破技术进步实现者经常碰到的障碍和保守主义，做每一个进步思想的倡议者和推动力，是我党所有各级组织和工人自治的任务。
   （摘自1月25日“人民论坛报”社论：“进步的广泛战线”）
    思想鼓励、社会觉悟、对全民利益的认识等因素
    影响成千上万的人——工人、技师、工程师的活动
    技术进步取决于成千上万的人——工人、技师、工程师、经济学家和科学工作者的活动。在我国，影响他们的活动的除了物质利益以外，还有思想鼓励的因素、职业的自豪感和高度的社会觉悟、对劳动的兴趣和忠实的努力、对全民利益的认识以及技术进步所赖以产生的、企业和机关中创造性劳动的气氛。因此，必须在企业中造成这样的气氛，并且发展这样一种认识，就是技术进步为更加安全和减轻劳动创造条件，消除体力劳动和脑力劳动之间的鸿沟，并且归根到底对人民群众的福利和文化水平具有决定性的意义。
              （摘自波兰“新路”杂志1960年第二期）
    如果劳动者不确信在为自己和后代建设共同的大厦
    社会主义建设就不能具有应有的速度和应有的规模
    几年来，特别是最近，统一工人党三中全会、党和经济积极分子对物质刺激这个提高劳动生产率的主要因素给予很大注意。这无疑是正确的，特别是在劳动定额、工资率和奖金问题需要急剧而尽可能快的调整的情况下。但是，如果不看到或是不充分估计精神刺激的作用，也是个错误。尽管单凭热情不足以建立起社会主义，但是，如果劳动者不确信他们在为自己和子孙后代建设共同的、日益完善的大厦，社会主义建设也不能具有应有的速度和应有的规模。因此，政治工作和管理制度是有巨大意义的，职工能因而被吸引来参加准备决定的过程，而集体思想是一人领导的决定的基础。
    我们给予劳动的报酬还不能像我们所希望的那样高，精神性质的刺激具有很大意义，能加强对社会主义制度的正义性的信念。
                       （摘自波兰1月19日“劳动之声报”）
