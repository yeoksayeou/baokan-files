Xinhua News Agency, Kunming Telegram: In Yunnan Province, Xiaochun crops are currently at the stages of jointing and heading, broad beans are podding, and rapeseed flowers are blooming everywhere, a time when water and fertilizer are urgently needed. To strengthen field management of Xiaochun crops and spring planting, the province has transferred a large number of laborers from logistics departments and completed water conservancy projects to reinforce the front line of spring farming. Currently, commune members in various places are fiercely attacking the critical stages of jointing, heading, and podding of Xiaochun crops, irrigating them for the second and third times, and applying fertilizer for the second time, striving for more spikes, more pods, and full grains for wheat, broad beans, and rapeseed.

This year, Yunnan Province has experienced very little spring rain, and more than six million mu of Xiaochun crops have suffered from varying degrees of drought. Party organizations in these areas have quickly organized professional teams and mobilized the masses to launch a mass movement to "compete with the heavens for grain." Yuxi Prefecture organized a 100,000-person drought relief team, which irrigated more than 600,000 mu of drought-affected Xiaochun crops in a very short time, greatly alleviating the drought situation.

People's communes on the north bank of the Honghe River and the west bank of the Nujiang River have transferred a large number of commune members to organize professional teams to prevent and control wheat rust, launching a mass wheat rust prevention campaign. In Baoshan County, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, more than 20,000 mu of wheat were affected by rust, with diseased plants accounting for more than 21%. The county's 22 people's communes immediately transferred commune members to form a joint prevention professional team to encircle and suppress wheat rust, immediately stopping the spread of rust. The diseased wheat gradually recovered its vitality, and the number of diseased plants has been reduced to about 1%.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Telegram: Sichuan is carrying out a field management campaign to "increase the planting of Xiaochun, catch up with the normal planting, and seize a comprehensive high-yield harvest of Xiaochun crops."

This year, the planting area of Xiaochun crops in Sichuan Province has increased by more than 20% compared to last year. Based on the spirit of planting more and harvesting more, and achieving high yields and more harvests, various places have also used idle land such as in front of and behind houses and along field edges to increase the planting of many Xiaochun crops. Among them, the "Rapeseed King" alone has 1.6 billion plants, which, calculated at 5,000 plants per mu, is equivalent to expanding the cultivated area by more than 300,000 mu. Therefore, the large area, complex varieties, and scattered management have become the main characteristics of this year's Xiaochun crop field management.

Various places paid attention to this issue from the beginning. To educate cadres and the masses to establish the idea of comprehensive management and comprehensive increase in production, Jiangjin Prefecture calculated an account: This year, the whole prefecture used idle land to increase the planting of peas and broad beans by more than 63 million jin, which is equivalent to increasing the cultivated area by more than 2 million mu. Calculated at 10 jin of harvest per jin of seeds, the increased planting of crops alone can yield more than 630 million jin of grain, enough for the entire region's population to eat for four months. By presenting the facts and reasoning, various places have further made the broad masses of cadres and the masses realize the importance of comprehensively managing Xiaochun's normal planting and increased planting crops. Under the slogan of "managing every corner well, achieving a double harvest of normal planting and increased planting," Zhengzhi District in Nanjiang County hoed and irrigated more than 30,000 mu of Xiaochun increased planting crops once within a few days. To meet the fertilizer needs of increased planting crops, the county fully utilized the favorable conditions of abundant fertilizer sources in mountainous areas and built more than 29,000 ash kilns and produced more than 130,000 jin of local fertilizer and accumulated more than 1.9 billion jin of natural fertilizer within half a month. After topdressing, weeding, and pest control, the county's 120,000 mu of Xiaochun increased planting crops grew luxuriantly and vigorously, just like the normally planted crops.

Strengthening leadership and further establishing and improving the management system is the key to comprehensively managing Xiaochun crops. Fengdu County established command organizations at all levels from the county to the district and people's commune, with dedicated cadres comprehensively leading the field management of Xiaochun crops. Many places have reorganized the professional teams managing Xiaochun crops, combining the management of normally planted Xiaochun crops and increased planting crops, and adopting methods of dividing areas, dividing sections, and assigning responsibility to individual households for management. After comprehensively arranging labor, the county gave a full application of human and animal manure water to more than 40,000 mu of Class III weak seedlings within three days. Now, both normally planted and increased planted Xiaochun crops are generally growing well.

The field management of Xiaochun crops in the province is progressing rapidly. By February 9, more than 90% of the Xiaochun fields had been topdressed twice, two-thirds had been cultivated twice, and more than half had been topdressed three times; more than 70% of the rapeseed in the province had been topdressed three times and cultivated twice, and those topdressed more frequently had reached six to seven times. Various places also generally applied pod-filling fertilizer to peas and broad beans. Currently, a field management upsurge of rushing to apply jointing and heading fertilizer to wheat, budding and bolting fertilizer to rapeseed, and pod-filling fertilizer to peas and broad beans is being carried out in depth throughout the province.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang Telegram: Various places in Jiangxi Province are stepping up field management of rapeseed in the mid-to-late stages, determined to win a bumper harvest of rapeseed this year.

This year, the rapeseed in Jiangxi Province generally grows with thick stems and strong leaves, all green, with an average seedling height of about six inches and eight to ten true leaves; Class I seedlings account for about 80%, and Class II seedlings exceed last year's Class I seedlings. This excellent situation has greatly encouraged the people of the province to strengthen the enthusiasm for field management of rapeseed. So far, the province's rapeseed has generally been topdressed and weeded twice, and many places have been topdressed and weeded three times.

To prevent cold waves, various places have generally strengthened frost and freeze prevention work since late January. Recently, according to the premature bolting and flowering of rapeseed in some places, timely measures such as topping and removing bolts, increasing the application of nitrogen fertilizer, and thinning seedlings and loosening soil have been taken to prevent it, ensuring the normal growth of rapeseed.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Telegram: The broad masses of peasants in Hunan Province are strengthening the later-stage management of rapeseed, striving to ensure that rapeseed in the province will have a harvest in every plot and a high yield in every mu. The rapeseed in the province has generally been cultivated and topdressed twice, 50% of the rapeseed fields have been cultivated and topdressed three times, and an average of more than 46 dan of fertilizer has been applied per mu. According to inspections in various places, Class I seedlings account for more than 65%, Class II seedlings account for 30%, and Class III seedlings account for about 5%.

To ensure high yield and more harvest of rapeseed, various places in the province have strengthened the leadership of rapeseed field management. People's communes have generally established rapeseed professional teams, implementing dedicated management and establishing a production responsibility system. In Xupu County, a high-yield rapeseed red flag county, all 150,000 mu of rapeseed fields have been cultivated and topdressed twice; 61,000 mu of high-yield plots have been cultivated and topdressed five times, with an average of more than 50 dan of fertilizer applied per mu. In Xinhu Commune, Linli County, more than 18,000 mu of rapeseed have been cultivated and topdressed seven times, with an average of more than 80 dan of fertilizer applied per mu. It has been achieved that every mu of rapeseed is free from pests and diseases, free from yellow leaves, and free from Class III seedlings.

In late January, various places in the province generally applied hot fertilizers such as grass and wood ash, fire soil ash, and pig and cattle manure to rapeseed fields, while loosening the soil to keep warm, thereby resisting the cold wave attack.

    加肥，加水，叫“小春”高产
    云南发动群众抗旱保丰收  四川开展“增种赶正种”运动  江西突击加强中后期管理  湖南力争丘丘保收亩亩丰产
    据新华社昆明电　云南省大部地区的小春正在拔节、孕穗，蚕豆也在结荚，油菜遍地花开，正是急需水肥的时候，为了加强小春作物田间管理和春播等，全省从后勤部门和已经完工的水利工地上抽调了大批劳动力加强春耕生产第一线。目前，各地人民公社社员正猛攻小春作物拔节、孕穗、结荚关，为小春作物润第二、第三遍水，追第二次肥，力争小麦、蚕豆、油菜穗多、荚多、籽粒饱满。
    今年，云南省春雨极少，已有六百多万亩小春作物发生不同程度的干旱现象，这类地区的党组织迅速组织专业队伍和发动群众开展“与天争粮”的群众运动。玉溪专区组织了十万人的抗旱队伍，在很短的时间内为六十多万亩受旱的小春作物润水，旱象大为减轻。
    红河北岸和怒江西岸的各人民公社，抽调了大批社员组织防治麦锈病的专业队伍，展开群众性防治麦锈病活动。德宏傣族景颇族自治州保山县有二万多亩小麦发生锈病，病株占21％以上，全县二十二个人民公社立即抽调社员组成围剿小麦锈病的联防专业队，使锈病立即停止了蔓延，已染病的小麦也逐渐恢复生机，病株已减少到1％左右。
    据新华社成都电　四川各地正在开展“小春增种赶正种、夺取小春作物全面高产丰收的田间管理运动。
    四川省今年小春作物播种面积比去年扩大20％以上。各地根据多种多收和高产多收的精神，还利用屋前屋后、田边地角等闲散土地增种了许多小春作物，其中仅“油菜王”一项就有十六亿株，以亩植五千株计算，等于扩大了三十多万亩耕地面积。因此，面积大，品种复杂，管理分散，成为今年小春作物田间管理的主要特点。
    各地一开始就注意了这个问题。为了教育干部和群众树立全面管理、全面增产的思想，江津专区算了一笔账：全专区今年利用空闲土地增种的豌豆、胡豆有六千三百多万斤，等于增加了二百多万亩耕地面积。以每斤种子收获十斤计算，单增种作物就可以多收粮食六亿三千多万斤，足够全区人口吃四个月。各地通过摆事实，讲道理，使广大干部和群众进一步认识到了全面管好小春正种和增种作物的重要意义。南江县正直区在“边边角角齐管好，正种增种双丰收”的口号下，几天之内就将三万多亩小春增种作物全部薅灌一次。这个县为了满足增种作物的用肥需要，充分利用山区肥源广的有利条件，在半个月内就造了两万九千多座火灰窑，制了十三万多斤土化肥，积了十九亿多斤自然肥。全县十二万亩小春增种作物经过追肥除草治虫以后，同正种作物一样，长得嫩绿茁壮。
    加强领导，进一步建立和健全管理制度，是全面管好小春作物的重要关键。丰都县从县到区和人民公社，层层建立了指挥机构，有专责干部全面领导小春作物田间管理工作。不少地方重新调整了管理小春作物的专业队伍，将小春正种作物和增种作物的管理结合起来，采取划片分段，分工包干的办法进行管理。全县经过全面安排劳力，在三天内给四万多亩三类弱苗全部饱施了一次人畜粪水，现在正种和增种的小春作物普遍生长良好。
    全省小春作物的田间管理工作进展很快。到2月9日，90％以上的小春田已追肥两次，三分之二已中耕两次，一半以上已追肥三次；全省70％以上的油菜已追肥三次，中耕两次，追肥多的已达六次到七次。各地对豌豆、胡豆也普施了结荚肥。目前，一个抢施小麦拔节孕穗肥、油菜现蕾抽苔肥和豌豆胡豆结荚肥的田间管理热潮，正在全省深入开展。
    据新华社南昌电　江西省各地突击加强油菜中后期田间管理，决心夺取今年油菜大丰收。
    今年，江西省的油菜普遍长得茎粗叶壮，一片青绿，一般苗高六寸左右，有八至十片真叶；一类苗占80％左右，二类苗超过去年的一类苗。这一大好形势，大大鼓舞了全省人民加强油菜田间管理的积极性。到目前为止，全省油菜已普遍追肥锄草二遍，不少地方已经追肥锄草三遍了。
    为了防止寒潮侵袭，各地在1月下旬以来普遍加强了防霜和防冻工作。最近，部分地方根据油菜过早抽苔开花的情况，及时采取摘芯打苔、增施氮肥和间苗松土等措施加以防止，保证油菜正常生长。
    据新华社长沙电　湖南省广大农民正在加强油菜的后期管理，力争全省油菜丘丘保收，亩亩丰产。全省油菜已普遍中耕追肥二次，有50％的菜田中耕追肥三次，平均每亩增施肥料四十六担以上。据各地检查，一类苗在65％以上，二类苗占30％，三类苗5％左右。
    为了保证油菜高产、多收，全省各地都加强了油菜田间管理工作的领导。各公社普遍建立了油菜专业队，实行专人管理，并建立了生产责任制度。油菜高产红旗县——溆浦县的十五万亩油菜田，已全部中耕追肥两次；有六万一千亩丰产片已中耕追肥五次，平均每亩追肥五十担以上。临澧县新合公社一万八千多亩油菜，进行了七次中耕追肥，平均每亩增施肥料八十担以上。做到了亩亩油菜无病虫害、无黄叶和无三类苗。
    1月下旬，全省各地普遍在油菜田里追施了草木灰、火土灰和猪牛粪等热性肥料，同时松土保温，从而抵御了寒潮侵袭。
