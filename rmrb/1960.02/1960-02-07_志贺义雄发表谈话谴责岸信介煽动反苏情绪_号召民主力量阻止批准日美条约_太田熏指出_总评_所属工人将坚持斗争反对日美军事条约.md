Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: Shiga Yoshio, member of the Central Committee Secretariat of the Japanese Communist Party and head of the Japanese Communist Party's Diet members' group, issued a statement in today's "Akahata" regarding the Liberal Democratic Party's submission to the Diet on the 4th of a "Resolution demanding the government lodge a serious protest against the Soviet government's memorandum." He strongly condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government and the ruling party for using this resolution to incite chauvinistic sentiments and for plotting to force the Diet to ratify the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

Shiga pointed out that the Soviet government has repeatedly suggested to the Japanese government that a Japan-Soviet peace treaty be signed, but the Japanese government has consistently failed to respond. Now, Japan has concluded a Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty with the United States directed against the Soviet Union, China, and other Asian countries, and describes the Soviet government's refusal under these circumstances to hand over Habomai and Shikotan Islands to Japan as "interference in Japan's internal affairs." This is clearly a deliberate misrepresentation of facts with ulterior motives.

Shiga pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government and the ruling party intend to use this opportunity to incite chauvinistic sentiments in order to forcibly ratify the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in the Diet.

He strongly condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party for also plotting, through anti-Soviet propaganda, to split the democratic forces that have been engaged in struggle for more than a year against the revision of the "Security Treaty" and to suppress the people's struggle against their scheme to forcibly ratify the new "Security Treaty."

Shiga called on the National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" to unite with all democratic forces and immediately launch actions to shatter this conspiracy of the reactionaries in order to prevent the Diet from ratifying the new "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: Ota Kaoru, chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), said on the 5th that Japanese workers will combine the movement against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" with the spring struggle to be launched in February, March, and April this year.

Ota Kaoru emphasized that workers belonging to "Sohyo" will steadfastly continue the struggle against the new "Security Treaty" until the treaty is abolished.

The trade union leader elaborated on the struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty at a radio discussion meeting hosted by the Cultural Broadcasting Corporation. He pointed out that the movement against the "Security Treaty" is the mainstream in the struggle against Japanese militarism and for peace. He said that "Sohyo" should promote the movement against the "Security Treaty" among a broader mass of people.

Referring to the struggle of Japanese coal miners against mass layoffs, Ota Kaoru said that the miners are essentially opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government and the monopoly capital's policy of splitting and persecuting trade unions. He pointed out that the government's policy is unconstitutional. He continued, "The struggle against the dismissal of active members of the Miike Coal Mine union of Mitsui Mining Company should essentially be regarded as a struggle to defend the basic human rights of workers as stipulated by the Constitution. All Japanese workers will never allow this struggle to fail." He emphasized that "The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan is prepared to wage a long-term struggle to have the decision to dismiss the miners revoked."

Ota Kaoru said that "Sohyo" will demand shorter working hours as a countermeasure against monopoly capital's intensified so-called "enterprise rationalization" plan. He pointed out that the "enterprise rationalization" plan is an inevitable result of the Kishi Nobusuke government's implementation of the so-called "trade liberalization" policy.

    志贺义雄发表谈话谴责岸信介煽动反苏情绪
    号召民主力量阻止批准日美条约
    太田熏指出“总评”所属工人将坚持斗争反对日美军事条约
    新华社6日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会干部会委员、日本共产党国会议员团团长志贺义雄今天在“赤旗报”上就自由民主党在4日向国会提出“要求政府就苏联政府备忘录提出严重抗议的决议案”一事发表谈话，强烈指责岸信介政府和执政党利用这项决议案煽动沙文主义情绪，并且阴谋强使国会批准日美军事同盟条约。
    志贺指出，苏联政府曾经不止一次地向日本政府建议签订日苏和约，但是日本政府一向没有作出答复。现在，日本同美国缔结针对苏中两国和其他亚洲国家的日美军事同盟条约，并且把苏联政府在这种情况下拒绝把齿舞群岛和色丹岛交给日本一事说成是“对日本内政的干涉”，显然这是颠倒是非的别有用心的宣传。
    志贺指出，岸信介政府和执政党是想利用这个机会煽动沙文主义情绪，以便在国会强行批准新日美“安全条约”。
    他强烈指责岸信介政府和自由民主党还阴谋通过反苏宣传，分裂一年多以来为反对修改“安全条约”而展开斗争的民主力量，压制人民反对它们强行批准新的“安全条约”的阴谋的斗争。
    志贺号召阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议同一切民主力量团结起来，立即展开行动，粉碎反动派的这种阴谋，以便阻止国会批准新的“安全条约”。
    新华社6日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会议长太田熏5日说，日本工人将结合反对新日美“安全条约”运动，在今年2、3、4月展开春季斗争。
    太田熏着重指出，“总评”所属工人将坚定不移地继续进行反对新“安全条约”的斗争，直到这项条约被废除为止。
    这位工会领导人在文化广播公司主办的广播讨论大会上详述了反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争。他指出，反对“安全条约”的运动是反对日本军国主义、争取和平斗争中的主流。他说，“总评”应当使反对“安全条约”的运动在更广大的人民群众中开展。
    太田熏在谈到日本煤矿工人反对大批解雇的斗争时说，矿工们实质上是反对岸信介政府和垄断资本的分裂和迫害工会的政策。他指出，政府的这种政策是违反宪法的。他接着说，“反对解雇三井矿山公司三池煤矿工会积极分子的斗争，实质上应当被认为是保卫宪法所规定的工人基本人权的斗争。全体日本工人决不容许这项斗争失败。”他着重指出，“日本工会总评议会准备进行长期的斗争，以使解雇矿工的决定撤销。”
    太田熏说，“总评”将要求缩短工时，作为反对垄断资本加强所谓“企业合理化”计划的对策。他指出，“企业合理化”计划是岸信介政府执行所谓“贸易自由化”政策的必然结果。
