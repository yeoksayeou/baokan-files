Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Electric Dispatch: The finance and banking departments of Jiangyou County, Sichuan Province, have adopted a "six combinations" approach to promptly assist communes in planning production funds, issuing loans and investments to communes, and supporting spring plowing and production. In the past month, the county has issued more than 260,000 yuan in agricultural loans and allocated 190,000 yuan in production investments to support poor teams.

The "six combinations" approach is: Under the guidance of relying on the masses, with the commune's self-reliance as the main factor and state assistance as supplementary, combine loan funds with various state funds invested in rural areas, combine state funds with commune-owned funds, combine fund allocation with the production and supply of materials, combine state-supplied means of production with commune-made means of production; in production arrangements, combine long-term construction with current production, and combine organizing production with arranging life. They helped the communes establish 24 semi-mechanized pig farms and 757 various factories, workshops, and processing groups for pesticides, farm tools, and fertilizers, increasing the cash income of all people's communes in the county by 200,700 yuan in less than a month.

    增加收入　合理用钱
    江油财政、银行部门给公社当参谋
    据新华社成都电　四川省江油县财政、银行部门采取“六结合”办法，及时帮助公社统筹安排生产资金，向公社发放贷款、投资，支援农业春耕生产。一个月来全县已发放农业贷款二十六万多元，拨出支援穷队的生产投资十九万元。
    “六结合”办法是：在依靠群众，以公社自力更生为主，国家援助为辅的原则指导下，把贷款资金与国家对农村投放的各项资金结合起来，国家资金与公社自有资金结合起来，资金投放与物资的生产供应结合起来，国家供应生产资料和公社自制生产资料结合起来；在生产安排上，把长期性的建设和当前生产结合起来，组织生产与安排生活结合起来。他们帮助公社建立了二十四个半机械化养猪场和农药、农具、肥料等各种厂坊、加工组七百五十七个，使全县各人民公社在不到一个月的时间内，增加了现金收入二十万零七千元。
