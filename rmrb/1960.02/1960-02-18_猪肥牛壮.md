Early this January, we returned to Beijing from Huaiyin Prefecture in Jiangsu and visited several people's communes along the way in this prefecture. Although it was a brief tour, it left us with many unforgettable impressions. …

	We stood in the fields of Huangji People's Commune in Huaian County and looked out. In the distance, under the blue sky and on the plains, sheep were everywhere. Three or five shepherds stood scattered among the flocks, occasionally raising their whips and shouting. What a beautiful pastoral scene! But why were most of these sheep black instead of white, and all of them so fat? Upon closer inspection, they weren't sheep at all, but pigs!

	Zhang Changzhong, a teenage shepherd at the site, told us with great experience: "You have to herd pigs like sheep for them to get fat. Pigs eat all kinds of grass, and all grass makes them gain weight, as long as people find it." Then he listed countless grass names for us, such as "Qiqi Cai," "Quxian Cai," "Da Zuo Tui," "Wanwan Cai," "Guangguang Zha," "Mabianzi"..., all of which were unheard of to us. We couldn't help but feel respectful and asked, "Have you been raising pigs for a long time?"

	"For over a year. As soon as the commune was established, I became a feeder. I love raising pigs."

	Following his direction, we came to a row of pigsties. This row of pigsties had about ten rooms, the ground covered with thick and soft straw, clean and tidy, without any unpleasant odor. In one of the pigsties, two large black sows were lying down, with a large pile of piglets in the middle, some black, some white, all as cute as kittens, rolling around and playing. An old man named Li Songyao, who was taking care of them, said to us: "These piglets were all born last night in the middle of the night by those two sows, seven in one litter, nine in the other, all strong." As he spoke, he picked up a bowl of soybeans and fed it to the sows, saying it was to help them produce more milk. After feeding, he picked up a little white pig, brushed off a bit of dust, and touched its ears. Another feeder told us: "Uncle Li didn't sleep all night last night, just guarding those two sows to help them give birth."

	According to Comrade Kai Wen, the deputy secretary of the commune party committee, since the establishment of the commune more than a year ago, the pigs raised in the entire commune can be averaged to nine and a half per household. "Now, Shanghai, Nanjing, and some cities in southern Jiangsu can eat pork from the commune."

	We also went to see the construction of the commune's 10,000-pig farm. There were forty pigsties in a row, with the first five rows being built, and the brick walls were being built. In front of each row of houses, there was a large open space left for planting feed. Trees were also planned to be planted around the area, and ditches dug. Comrade Kai Wen said that each production brigade was also building a 1,000-pig farm, and each production team was building a 100-pig farm.

	It was getting late, and we were saying goodbye when suddenly a person flashed out from the roadside, raised a cow horn, and blew it loudly, asking him what he was doing. He said it was a call to assemble, to urge the pigs to return to the pigsties. Looking up, sure enough, the pig herd in the pasture had already begun to move upon hearing the sound. A wonderful evening return scene immediately appeared before our eyes: a large white pig of the Yorkshire breed took the lead and ran swiftly, like a pioneer, followed by countless pigs of all sizes, black and white, in groups of three or five, running swiftly.

	Entering Longshan People's Commune in Xuyi County, the first thing we noticed was cattle everywhere. In front of and behind the villages, under the eaves of doorways, cows were almost always tied up; by the river, old people were leading cattle to drink water; on the threshing ground, children were playing on the backs of cattle; on the way, peasants were driving herds of cattle past us.

	We stopped next to a cow shed, watching a row of ten or so cows lined up in front of the door, chewing grass in the trough. Three children dressed in colorful clothes were riding on the back of the largest cow, making a fuss. We asked: "Aren't you afraid of the cow?" The children said: "We're not afraid of the cow, we're afraid of the cow's dad." One child, quick-witted, shouted: "Cow's dad is coming! He's really coming!" The three naughty children immediately slid off the cow's back and scattered in all directions.

	The cow's dad's surname wasn't actually Cow, it's just that people gave him this nickname because he loved cows like his own children. Seven parts of it were respect, and three parts were a good-natured joke. His real name was Yue Bangquan, and he was a well-known model for raising cattle, and his model deeds had been published in the county newspaper more than once.

	When he heard others talking about him, he felt embarrassed and interjected: "Hey, what am I? There are many cattle-raising models in the commune!" He especially mentioned the commune secretary, Yuan Chunrong, saying that he took the lead in pulling cattle for breeding, setting off a craze. Breeding was the key to increasing cattle here. In the past, people disliked it as dirty and were unwilling to do it. Later, cadres took the lead as role models, and even many young women became inseminators.

	We asked, "Did the old man raise cattle in the past?" Unexpectedly, this question evoked the old man's sad story. He frowned and opened up: He had been a farmhand for more than twenty years, without a single plot of land, so where would he get cattle? Instead, he was used by the landlord as a cow. After liberation, he was allocated land, worked diligently for several years, and finally managed to save up a quarter of a cow. He said with emotion: "Working alone won't get you anywhere, and a large collective is better than a small collective. More than a year after the establishment of the people's commune, the number of cattle increased to one head per household in the entire commune. In the past, when there were few cattle, our shoulders were worn out, and we used human power to replace the power of cattle. This year, with more cattle, the soles of our feet are worn out (because we don't travel often, the calluses on our feet have receded), and the power of cattle has replaced the power of humans."

	He pointed to the mountains around the fields and said: "There will be even more cattle in the spring, all grazing on the mountains. Once, during a grand review, the cattle from our Mingshan Brigade alone filled these several mountains. Later, we supported fraternal communes and sold a lot. We sold cattle to exchange for tractors."

	Looking up at the mountains, the mountains were not high. There were also several houses on the mountain peaks, which were temporary cattle sheds at the time. Halfway up the mountain, a long string of three slogans inlaid with white ash was written: "The General Line Shines Boundlessly!" "Long Live the Great Leap Forward!" "The People's Commune is Good!" Each character was the size of a mu of land, and was especially white and shiny, illuminated by the midday sun, and could be seen clearly from ten li away.

	We were simulating the scene of the mountains full of cattle at the time, when the old man said excitedly: "Take another look at our cattle and see how they are different from those elsewhere?"

	Without careful scrutiny, we had already seen that the cattle here, except for the calves, were all tall, large, fat, and strong.

	The old man smiled and nodded, stroking his mustache, and added to us: "And each generation is stronger than the last. This cow is the daughter, that cow is the mother, and the daughter is even bigger than the mother. Just like people, there are more young cattle-raising models in our commune than old ones."

	But why didn't the old man let the children ride the cattle for fun?

	The old man raised his eyebrows, patted the largest cow, stroked its fur, and said: "It doesn't matter if you ride other cows, but you can't ride this cow." It turned out that there was another story behind it: This cow had been made weak and thin by a reckless young man who used it improperly and didn't pay attention to management in the spring, and everyone decided to slaughter it. The old man couldn't bear it, so he insisted on dragging it home, vacated a sunny room for it to live in, took the time to wash it, fed it bean buns (straw wrapped in soybeans), added his share of white sugar to the porridge for it to eat, and got up twice at night to help it light a fire and urinate. After half a year of conditioning, this cow became so strong and beautiful, and it was already pregnant with a calf.

	Now the team has a set of rules for raising and using cattle. They are especially careful with pregnant cows, hanging red cloth to prevent overuse and miscarriage, and they eat especially well.

	The setting sun was on the mountain, the cattle herds were returning to their sheds one after another, and the old feeder was busy taking care of the cattle.

    猪肥牛壮
    夏方剑
  今年1月初，我们从江苏淮阴专区回北京，顺路在这个专区参观了几个人民公社。虽是走马观花，却也留下了不少难忘的印象。……
    我们在淮安县黄集人民公社的田头眺望，只见远处蓝天下、平原上，满布羊群。三五个牧人，散立在羊群中间，不时挥起鞭子吆喝几声。好一幅放牧图！只是为什么这群羊儿黑多白少、只只肥胖？近前一看，哪是什么羊，全都是猪！
    场上一个十几岁的牧童叫张长忠，蛮有经验地告诉我们说：“就要像放羊一样放猪，猪才长得肥。猪吃百样草，百草都长膘，只要人去找。”接着他就给我们列举无数草名，什么乞乞菜、曲线菜、大桌腿、弯弯菜、光光渣、马鞭子……，都是闻所未闻的。我们不禁肃然起敬，问道：“你养猪很久了吧？”
    “一年多了。公社一成立，我就当上了饲养员。我喜欢养猪。”
    我们顺着他指点的方向，来到一排猪舍前。这排猪舍有十来间，地上铺着厚实而又松软的稻草，干净整齐，闻不出一点臭味。有一间猪舍里，两头躺着两只大黑母猪，中间一大堆小猪，有黑有白，只只像小猫那么可爱，正在打滚戏耍。照料它们的是一位老人，名叫李颂尧，对我们说：“这小猪都是那两头母猪昨夜半夜里下的，一窝七只，一窝九只，只只壮实。”说话间，他拿起一钵黄豆，喂母猪吃，说是让它多下奶。喂完，又抱起一只小白猪来，拂去它身上一点尘土，摸了摸它的耳朵。另一位饲养员告诉我们：“李大爷昨晚一夜没睡，就守着那两头母猪接生。”
    据公社党委副书记开文同志说，公社成立一年多来，全公社饲养的猪，每户社员可以平均摊到九头半。“现在，上海、南京和苏南一些城市都能吃到公社的猪肉了。”
    我们又去看公社万头猪场的兴建。猪舍一排四十间，先修五排，正在砌砖墙。每排房子前面，留有大片空地，种饲料。四周还准备栽树、挖沟。开文同志说，各生产大队也正在兴建千头猪场，生产小队是百头猪场。
    天色不早了，我们正在告辞，忽然道旁闪出一人，举起牛角，昂着头吹得嘟嘟响，问他干吗？他说这是集合号，催猪回猪舍。抬头一望，果真，牧场上的猪群已闻声动弹起来了。一幅奇妙的晚归图立时出现在眼前：一只约克夏种的大白猪领先飞奔，仿佛开路先锋，随后无数大大小小、黑的白的猪，三五成群，跟着飞奔。
    进入盱眙县龙山人民公社，第一眼就发现到处是牛。庄前村后，门口檐下，差不多都拴得有牛；河边，老人们牵着牛饮水；场上，孩子们爬在牛背上嬉耍；途中，农民赶着牛群从我们身旁走过。
    我们在一幢牛舍旁边站定，看门前十来条牛一字儿排开，正在槽里嚼草。有三个穿着花衣服的小孩子骑在一条最大的牛身上打闹。我们问道：“不怕牛吗？”孩子们说：“不怕牛，怕牛爸爸。”一个孩子眼快，尖声叫道：“牛爸爸来了！真的来了！”三个顽皮孩子立时溜下牛背，一哄而散。
    牛爸爸并不姓牛，只因他爱牛如子，人们就送他这个绰号。这里头七分是尊敬，三分是善意的玩笑。他本名叫岳邦全，是闻名的养牛模范，模范事迹在县报上登过不止一次。
    听到别人讲他的时候，他在一旁听得不好意思，插进来说道：“咳，我算什么，社里养牛模范多得很！”他特别提到公社书记院春荣，说他带头拉牛配种，掀起了热潮。配种是他们这里增加牛的关键，过去人们嫌脏，不肯干，后来干部们都以身作则带头干，连许多青年妇女都担任了配种员。
    我们问：“老人家过去养过牛吗？”不料这一问勾起了老人的伤心事，他眉毛一皱，打开了话匣子：当过二十多年雇农，一分地也没有，哪来牛？倒是自己给地主当过牛使用。解放后分了土地，辛勤劳动几年，好不容易才攒下四分之一条牛。他颇有感慨，说道：“单干成不了事，大集体又比小集体好，人民公社成立一年多，耕牛增加到全公社每户一头。往年牛少，我们肩膀塌层皮，人力替牛力。今年牛多，我们脚底板退层皮（不常跑路，老茧皮退了），牛力替了人力。”
    他指着田野周围的山，又说道：“春天牛更多，都放在山上吃草。有一次大检阅，光我们明山大队的牛就站满了这几个山头。后来支援兄弟社，卖了不少。我们卖牛换拖拉机。”
    仰视群山，山不高。山头还有几座房子，是当时的临时牛舍。半山腰里一长溜嵌着白灰写的三条标语：“总路线光芒万丈！”“大跃进万岁！”“人民公社好！”字字有一亩地大，被正午的阳光照耀得格外雪白闪亮，十里路外都看得分明。
    我们正在摸拟当时满山是牛的情景，老人又兴奋地说：“你们再看看我们的牛和别处有什么不同？”
    不用仔细端详，我们早就看出：这里的牛，除牛犊外，头头长得又高又大又膘又壮。
    老人笑得呵呵地点着头，摸着八字胡髭，给我们补充道：“而且一代比一代强。这牛是闺女，那牛是妈妈，闺女比妈妈长得还大。和人一样，我们社里养牛模范就青年比老年多。”
    可是老人为什么不让孩子们骑牛玩呢？
    老人眉毛一扬，拍着这条最大的牛，顺了顺牛毛，说道：“骑别的牛不要紧，这牛不能骑。”原来这里面又有一段故事：这牛因为被一个楞小伙子使得不当，又没注意管理，春天时弄得瘦弱不堪，大家都决定要斩吃了。老人家舍不得，硬拉着回家，腾出向阳屋子给它住，抽空就替它洗刷，喂它豆包子（稻草卷着黄豆），把自己份内的白糖渗入稀饭给它吃，夜里两次起来替它生火把尿。调养了半年，这牛就变成了现在这般又壮又漂亮的模样，而且肚里已怀上了小牛。
    现在队里养牛、用牛都有一套制度。对孕牛特别小心，挂着红布，防止使用过度流产，吃得也特别好。
    夕阳在山，牛群纷纷归舍，这位老饲养员也就忙着照料牛去了。
