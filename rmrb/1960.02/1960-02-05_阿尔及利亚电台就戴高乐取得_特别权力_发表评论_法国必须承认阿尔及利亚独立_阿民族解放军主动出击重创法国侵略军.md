Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 3rd. The "Voice of the Algerian Republic" radio station commented on the French parliament's passage of granting the government "special powers" on February 2nd, saying that "special powers" cannot save the De Gaulle government, and its only way out is to recognize Algerian independence.

The radio station said that the fascist danger created by French colonialists in Algeria not only threatens France but also threatens the whole of Europe.

The radio station said that if De Gaulle stubbornly refuses to face the ironclad facts, he will be shattered by the rocks of the Algerian revolution.

The radio station concluded that De Gaulle absolutely cannot stop the Algerian revolution. The National Liberation Army, supported by twelve million Algerian people, will fight more resolutely until they achieve the goals of the revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 3rd. The headquarters of the Algerian National Liberation Army today issued a communique regarding military activities from January 26th to 31st.

They also destroyed 14 enemy tanks and three armored vehicles with rocket launchers and anti-aircraft guns. The Algerian National Liberation Army seized seven enemy weapons and a large quantity of ammunition.

The communique said that the Algerian army launched a fierce attack on a French military position, killing all the French troops stationed there. The Algerian army seized the weapons of the French garrison and burned their tents.

The communique said that during this period, the Algerian army ambushed the French army in ten locations and engaged in combat with the enemy at four positions.

In Toukni and Oubayad, the Algerian army engaged in fierce fighting with the French aggressor troops. The Algerian army also attacked the eastern power grid and damaged several power grids.
