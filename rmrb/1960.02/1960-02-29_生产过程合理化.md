    Rationalizing the Production Process

    The Hebei Daily published an editorial on February 24 entitled "Innovate the Production Process and Improve Labor Efficiency." Here is a summary:

    The most fundamental way to improve labor efficiency is to achieve agricultural mechanization. We are working hard to achieve this task. However, this task cannot be accomplished in a morning or two. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement we are carrying out is an important method to improve labor efficiency under the current conditions. Through tool reform, gradually reform and create semi-mechanized agricultural tools from old-fashioned farm tools; improving labor organization and implementing the responsibility system are also methods to improve labor efficiency. The North Mengzhuang Management Area of Shuangmiao Commune in Jiaocheng County starts with the reform of the production process, so that the old production process gradually moves from irrationality to rationality, and further taps labor potential, which is another way to improve labor efficiency.

    The process of production development is the process of gradually reforming tools, and it is also the process of gradually rationalizing the production process. The level of labor efficiency is mainly determined by people and the tools they use. Every step forward in tool development greatly improves labor efficiency. However, whether tools can give full play to their effectiveness also depends on the people who use them. Agricultural production has certain rules, and various agricultural activities must be carried out according to different seasons and crops. The land is near and far, the tools require different technologies, the skill level of the labor force itself is different, and the physical strength is also different, which determines that the production layout, production procedures, and labor organization must be adapted to it. With the improvement of the degree of collective labor, the scientization of production technology, and the continuous improvement of tools, the production layout, procedures, and labor organization must also change accordingly. At present, the production procedures adopted in rural areas are to a large extent no longer able to meet the needs of the great development of production after communization, especially the needs after the large-scale emergence of high-yield formulas and improved tools. People have keenly felt that the irrationality of the production process is hindering the full play of the potential of people and tools, and demanding to change this irrational situation, so as to further improve labor efficiency.

    The innovation of the production process is a revolution in the mode of production. It does not only include a certain link in production or a certain labor force, but involves all links in production and all the labor force. Therefore, it can only be effectively carried out by relying on the collective strength and collective wisdom of the members who work in each link. This requires fully mobilizing the masses and following the mass line, so that the production process innovation movement becomes a conscious movement of the masses.

    The fundamental purpose of the production process innovation movement is to develop production at high speed. To make this movement a success, it is also necessary to implement the policy of running the commune diligently and thriftily and the principle of adapting to local conditions. Generally speaking, the investment in the innovation of the production process is small, and the reform of many links does not require any investment; however, some reforms require more funds and time. Therefore, it is necessary to adapt to local conditions and times, make do with whatever is available, otherwise it will affect current production and cause waste. The North Mengzhuang Management Area conscientiously grasped this policy, and actively carried out the reforms that require less investment and are urgently needed for current production in conjunction with current production; for some links that can save a large amount of labor after the reform, but require a lot of labor, investment, and affect current production, they made plans and gradually implemented them. This shows that as long as there is a spirit of active innovation, starting from production, and starting from running the commune diligently and thriftily, significant gains will surely be achieved.

### 生产过程合理化

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    生产过程合理化
    2月24日河北日报以“革新生产过程提高劳动效率”为题发表社论。摘要如下：
    提高劳动效率最根本的办法，是实现农业的机械化。我们正在为实现这一任务而努力。但是，这一任务并不是一、两个早晨就能实现的。我们开展的技术革新和技术革命运动，就是在目前条件下，提高劳动效率的重要方法。通过工具改革，逐步将旧式的农具改制和创制为半机械化农具；改进劳动组织，贯彻责任制，也是提高劳动效率的方法。交河县双庙公社北孟庄管理区从生产过程改革入手，使旧的生产过程逐步由不合理走向合理，进一步挖掘劳动潜力，这是提高劳动效率的又一途径。
    生产发展的过程是逐步改革工具的过程，也是生产过程逐步合理化的过程。劳动效率的高低，主要是由人和人使用的工具来决定的。工具每向前发展一步，劳动效率就大大提高一步。但是工具能不能充分发挥效能，还决定于使用工具的人。农业生产有一定规律，要按照季节、作物的不同，进行各种农事活动。土地有远有近，工具需要的技术不同，劳动力本身技术熟练的程度不同，体力的强弱也各异，这就决定了在生产的布局、生产的程序以及劳动力的组织等方面，都必须与之相适应。随着集体劳动程度的提高、生产技术的科学化以及工具的不断改进，生产的布局、程序和劳动组织也必须随着变化。目前农村中采用的生产程序等等，在很大程度上已经不能适应公社化后生产大发展的需要，特别是不能适应丰产方和改良工具大量出现以后的需要。人们已经迫切感到生产过程的不合理正在阻碍着人和工具潜力的充分发挥，要求改变这种不合理的状况，从而使劳动效率得到进一步的提高。
    生产过程的革新，是生产方式的一个革命，不是只包括生产的某一个环节，或某一个劳动力，而是牵涉到生产的各个环节和全部劳动力。因此只有依靠在各个环节上劳动的社员集体的力量和集体的智慧，才能有效地进行。这就需要充分发动群众，走群众路线，使生产过程革新运动成为群众自觉的运动。
    生产过程革新运动的根本目的，是为了高速度地发展生产。要使这一运动搞得好，还必须贯彻勤俭办社的方针和因地制宜的原则。进行生产过程的革新，一般地说投资较小，有许多环节的改革，并不需要任何投资；但有一些改革，却需要较多资金和时间。因此，必须因地因时制宜，因陋就简，否则也会影响当前生产，造成浪费。北孟庄管理区认真地掌握了这个方针，对于投资少、当前生产又急需的，结合当前生产积极进行；有些环节改革后虽然可以节省出大批劳动力，但由于用工多投资大、影响当前生产的，就作出规划，逐步去办。这说明只要有积极革新的精神，从生产出发，从勤俭办社出发，就一定能取得重大的收获。
