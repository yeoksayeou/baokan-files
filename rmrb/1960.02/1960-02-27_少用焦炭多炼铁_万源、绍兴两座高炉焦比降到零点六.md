Less Coke, More Iron
Wanyuan and Shaoxing Blast Furnaces Reduce Coke Ratio to 0.6

    (Our report) The workers of the Wanshui Iron Plant in Wanyuan County, Sichuan Province, vigorously carried out technical innovation, trying every possible means to reduce coke consumption, and achieved the goal of using less coke to produce more iron and better iron. Since the beginning of this year, the average coke consumption per ton of iron produced has been 0.63 tons, compared to 1.06 tons in the same period last year. As the coke ratio decreased, the ore input rate increased, the utilization coefficient and pig iron quality of the blast furnace rapidly improved, and costs also decreased significantly. The average utilization coefficient of the blast furnace is 1.083. The average cost per ton of iron is only 98.1 yuan.
    In order to increase the blast temperature and volume, the workers of this plant improved the blower pulley, increasing the speed from the original 290 revolutions to 405 revolutions, and increasing the wind pressure from 45 mercury columns to 60 mercury columns; they increased the number of burners in the hot blast stove from two to eight in two stoves, increasing the wind temperature from the original 440 degrees to 580 degrees. In terms of ore, they strengthened the roasting and sintering of ore before it was put into the furnace, improving the ore grade. The iron content of the ore increased from the original 48% to 55%, ensuring that the blast furnace was fed with refined, fine, and full materials. At the same time, they insisted on using all quicklime as a flux in the furnace, which not only ensured the temperature of the hearth but also strengthened desulfurization and improved the quality of the iron. In addition, they also strengthened post-furnace management and strictly enforced operating procedures.
    (Our report) The workers of the No. 1 furnace with a volume of 27.5 cubic meters in the No. 1 Iron Smelting Workshop of Shaoxing Iron and Steel Plant in Zhejiang Province vigorously carried out technical innovation and created an outstanding achievement of a coke ratio as low as 0.603. Since the end of early February, the coke ratio of this furnace has been below 0.9 for ten days, with an average coke ratio reduced to 0.708. The pig iron qualification rate is between 99% and 100%, and the utilization coefficient reaches above 1.
    Based on the central requirement of both increasing furnace temperature and reducing coke consumption, the workers on this blast furnace carried out a series of technical innovations in operating techniques and raw material processing. For example, the hot air workers, with the strong assistance of the mechanical repair workers, improved the tuyere device, increasing the temperature by about 50 degrees. In order to handle the raw materials well and reduce the coke ratio, the blast furnace workers and the raw material yard workers also made many innovations in raw material processing.

    少用焦炭多炼铁
    万源、绍兴两座高炉焦比降到零点六
    本报讯　四川省万源县万水铁厂职工，大闹技术革新，千方百计降低焦炭消耗量，做到了少用焦，多炼铁，炼好铁。今年以来，平均每炼一吨铁用零点六三吨焦炭，而去年同期每炼一吨铁要用一点零六吨焦。随着焦比下降，入炉矿石率增加，高炉利用系数和生铁质量迅速提高，成本也有大幅度的下降。高炉平均利用系数为一点零八三。每吨铁的平均成本只有九十八点一元。
    这个厂的职工为了提高风温风量，改进了鼓风机皮带轮，使转速由原来的二百九十转提高到四百零五转，使风压由四十五个水银柱增加到六十个水银柱；他们把热风炉的燃烧嘴由一炉两个增加为两炉八个，使风温由原来的四百四十度提高到五百八十度。在矿石方面，加强了焙烧和烧结矿入炉，提高了矿石品位，矿石含铁量由原来的48％提高到55％，保证了高炉吃精吃细吃饱。同时，坚持了全部用生石灰入炉做溶剂，既保证了炉缸温度，也加强了脱硫，提高了铁的质量，此外，还加强了炉后管理，严格了操作制度。
    本报讯　浙江绍兴钢铁厂第一炼铁车间27．5立方米一号炉的职工大闹技术革新，创造了焦比最低达到0．603的出色成绩。自2月上旬末以来，这个炉有十天的焦比都在0．9以下，平均焦比降低到0．708。生铁合格率在99％至100％之间，利用系数达到1以上。
    这座高炉上的职工根据既要提高炉温、又要少耗焦炭这个中心要求，在操作技术、原料处理等方面进行了一系列的技术革新。例如，热风工在机修工人的大力协助下，改进了风嘴装置，温度提高了五十度左右。为了处理好原料，降低焦比，高炉工人和原料场工人在原料处理方面也进行了很多革新。
