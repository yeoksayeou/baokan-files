Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: Adachi Tadashi, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, told about 100 American entrepreneurs at a luncheon held by the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry at the Tokyo American Club on the 11th that Japan should first develop Southeast Asia. Then, after Japan creates favorable conditions for the inflow of American capital, the United States will follow Japan into Southeast Asia.

Adachi believes that, up to now, the efforts made by the United States to "aid" and develop Southeast Asia "have not yielded any positive results." With Japan as a pioneer, the United States can most effectively enter the region economically, although it may seem like taking a roundabout route.

    日本一垄断资本家表示
    愿为美国掠夺东南亚效劳
    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本商工会议所会长足立正11日在日本商工会议所在东京美国俱乐部举行的午宴上向约一百名美国企业家说，日本应当首先开发东南亚。接着，在日本为美国的资本流入创造了有利的条件以后，美国再跟随日本进入东南亚。
    足立正认为，到现在为止，美国为“援助”和开发东南亚所作的努力“没有得到什么积极的结果”。美国以日本为先驱，能够最有效地在经济上进入这个地区，虽然看来仿佛是走弯路。
