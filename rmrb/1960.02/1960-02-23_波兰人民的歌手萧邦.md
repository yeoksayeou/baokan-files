Chopin, Singer of the Polish People
Zhao Wen

February 22nd of this year marks the 150th anniversary of the birth of the Polish composer Chopin. To commemorate this representative figure of Polish musical culture and artistic master beloved by progressive humanity around the world, the people of our country and people of various countries around the world are holding a series of commemorative activities.

Frederic Chopin was born near Warsaw on February 22, 1810. His father, Nicolas Chopin, was a Frenchman who had settled in Poland from childhood. He participated in the struggle for the independence and liberation of his second homeland and served as a captain in Kościuszko's insurgent army. After the failure of the Polish uprising in 1794, this man, who revered the ideas of the French Enlightenment, became a French teacher in a Warsaw middle school; the father, who admired the ideas of Voltaire and Rousseau, influenced the future composer with these ideas from an early age.

Chopin's mother loved music and was familiar with Polish folk songs. From an early age, Chopin loved writing poetry, painting, acting, but especially music. He wrote his first polonaise at the age of seven. When he spent his holidays in the manor of a friend, he often immersed himself in the study of folk songs. Peasant dances could keep Chopin lingering for hours, and when he was excited, he would pick up a double bass and play the oberek or mazurka himself; his brilliant performance would attract people to gather around immediately. When he sat on the fence of the Szafarnia farm listening to people singing folk songs, he recorded them one after another. On the streets of Warsaw, he never missed an opportunity to listen to people singing folk tunes. While studying at the Conservatory of Music, Chopin's teacher, Elsner, was a defender of Polish national musical culture, and he advocated the establishment and creation of Polish national musical culture. These ideas greatly inspired Chopin's sense of national consciousness in music.

On the other hand, from childhood, Chopin's first music teacher, Ryfni, cultivated his love for classical music - the music of Bach and Mozart.

During Chopin's youth, the Polish national liberation movement was on the rise, and newspapers often discussed the abolition of serfdom; Chopin attended the funeral of Staszic, a political commentator and writer who advocated the emancipation of serfs, and took back a piece of mourning gauze covering the coffin as a memento. This story clearly illustrates Chopin's ideological inclinations.

Young Chopin lived in Warsaw. The two piano concertos he wrote during this period (E minor and F minor, Op. 11 and 21) are Mozartian concertos. Here, one can see the composer's gentle, lyrical, delicate, and beautiful side, full of youthful vitality; and all of this is expressed in a strong and distinct national style. Poetic and bright optimism, and superb piano technique have fully revealed the talent of the young composer.

In early November 1830, Chopin's teacher, Elsner, advised him to travel abroad to promote Polish national musical culture. Before leaving, people gave him a silver cup filled with Polish soil to express their congratulations and encouragement. He had just arrived in Vienna when the Warsaw Uprising broke out. In July 1831, Chopin went to France with a visa to pass through Paris with great difficulty, and learned of the failure of the uprising on the way. Chopin, a patriot, was plunged into grief and indignation.

Chopin, the pianist and composer, gained fame in Paris. By the 1840s, Chopin had reached the maturity of his creative period. His most important works, such as the Sonata in B-flat minor and B minor, the Fantasy in F minor, the Second, Third, and Fourth Ballades, the Polonaises in A major, F-sharp minor, and A-flat major, the Second, Third, and Fourth Scherzos, and some mazurkas, nocturnes, etc., were all completed in these years. Profound patriotic thought and revolutionary emotion are the characteristics of Chopin's works during his mature period.

The misfortunes of life and economic difficulties tormented Chopin for most of his life. For the sake of living, Chopin had to teach many piano students in Paris for one or two decades. In 1848, Chopin dragged his sick body to England to give concerts. After becoming seriously ill, he returned to Paris. On October 17, 1849, Chopin died in Paris. People sprinkled a handful of Polish soil that he had brought from his homeland on Chopin's grave. According to his will, Chopin's heart was transported back to Warsaw.

    波兰人民的歌手萧邦
    兆文
    今年2月22日是波兰作曲家萧邦诞生一百五十周年。为了纪念这位波兰音乐文化的代表人物和世界进步人类热爱的艺术大师，我国人民和世界各国人民一起，举行了一系列的纪念活动。
    弗列德里克·萧邦1810年2月22日生于华沙附近。他的父亲尼古拉·萧邦是自幼侨居波兰的法国人，曾参加了为自己的第二祖国的独立解放斗争，并在柯斯秋斯柯的起义军里担任上尉职务。1794年波兰起义失败后，这个崇奉法国启蒙学派思想的人在华沙的中学任法文教员；崇拜伏尔泰和卢骚的思想的父亲自幼年便给予未来作曲家以这种思想上的影响。
    萧邦的母亲热爱音乐并熟知波兰民歌。萧邦自幼年便爱好作诗、绘画、演剧，但特别爱好音乐。他在七岁的时候便写作了第一首波兰舞曲。在朋友的庄园中度假期时，经常沉湎于民歌的研究中。农民的舞会可以使萧邦一连几小时徘徊不去，激动时自己也拿着低音提琴拉起奥别列克或马祖卡舞曲；精采的演奏吸引得人们都会立刻跑拢来。当他坐在沙发尔尼亚农庄的篱笆上倾听人们演唱的民歌时，便一首又一首地记录下来。在华沙的街头，他从不放过任何一个倾听人们演唱民歌小曲的机会。在音乐学院求学时，萧邦的教师爱尔斯涅尔是波兰民族音乐文化的捍卫者，他主张建立、创造波兰的民族音乐文化。这些主张大大启发了萧邦在音乐上的民族自觉的思想。
    另一方面，从幼年起，萧邦的第一个音乐教师瑞夫尼便培养了他对古典音乐——巴哈和莫扎特的音乐的喜爱。
    在萧邦的青年时期，波兰的民族解放斗争运动日益高涨，报刊经常讨论废除农奴制的主张；萧邦参加了主张解放农奴的政论家、作家斯塔席茨的葬礼，并取回一片复盖灵柩的丧纱作为纪念，这个故事清楚地说明了萧邦的思想倾向。
    青年时期的萧邦居住在华沙，这一时期他所写的两首钢琴协奏曲（E小调和F小调、作品十一号和二十一号）是莫扎特式的协奏曲。在这里，可以看见作曲家温柔、抒情、纤丽、优美的一面，充满着青春的生气；而这一切又都是在浓厚、鲜明的民族风格之中表现出来的。诗意的和明朗的乐观情绪、精湛的钢琴手法已经充分显露了青年的作曲家的才华。
    1830年11月初，萧邦的老师爱尔斯涅尔劝他到国外旅行，宣扬波兰的民族音乐文化。临行时，人们用银杯盛了波兰的泥土送给他，表示对他的祝贺和勉励。他刚到维也纳便暴发了华沙起义，1831年7月，萧邦费了九牛二虎之力弄到了一张路过巴黎的签证到了法国，途中便知道了起义失败的消息。爱国主义者的萧邦陷入悲愤的情绪之中。
    钢琴家、作曲家的萧邦在巴黎获得了盛誉。四十年代的萧邦已经到了他的创作上的成熟时期。他的最重要的作品如降B小调和B小调奏鸣曲、F小调幻想曲、第二、第三、第四叙事曲，A大调升F小调降A大调幻想波兰舞曲、第二、第三、第四诙谑曲及一些马祖卡舞曲、夜曲等，都完成于这些年代。深刻的爱国主义思想和革命情感的充沛，是成熟时期的萧邦作品的特征。
    生活的不幸和经济的困难，折磨了萧邦的大半生。为了生活，在巴黎一、二十年间萧邦不得不教了很多的钢琴学生。1848年萧邦拖着生病的身子去英国开音乐会，病重后回到巴黎，1849年10月17日萧邦死于巴黎。人们在萧邦的墓地洒了一把他自己从祖国带出来的波兰的泥土。按照他的遗嘱，萧邦的心脏被运回华沙。
