    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 1st. Romanian agricultural workers are actively preparing for spring plowing and sowing in order to strive for a greater bumper harvest in agricultural production this year and overfulfill the total agricultural output value plan.
    This year, the work of repairing tractors and other agricultural machinery in various machine tractor stations and state farms has been carried out quite rapidly. At present, this work has been completed by more than 70%; while only 44% was completed in the same period last year.
    The amount of natural fertilizer applied this year has greatly increased compared to last year. Farmers in various places are braving the severe cold and continue to transport fertilizer to the fields. So far, 14 million tons of natural fertilizer have been applied to the cultivated land preparing for spring sowing, exceeding the plan by 40%.
    At present, 20% of the seed selection work has been completed nationwide in Romania. Most of the varieties selected this year are high-yielding varieties.
    Romania will add more than 10,000 tractors and a large number of other agricultural machines this year. Now, machine tractor stations in various places have opened many training classes to train technical cadres to use agricultural machinery. Activities to learn agricultural technology have also been launched in rural areas across the country. This year, 560,000 people have participated in short-term training courses in agricultural and animal husbandry techniques, 100,000 more than last year.

    选种工作完成五分之一　普遍开班学习农业技术
    新华社布加勒斯特1日电　罗马尼亚农业劳动者为争取今年农业生产的更大丰收和超额完成农业总产值计划，目前正在积极进行春耕、春种等准备工作。
    今年各地机器拖拉机站和国营农场检修拖拉机和其它农业机器的工作，进行得相当迅速，目前这一工作已经完成了70％以上；而去年同期只完成了44％。
    今年天然肥料的施用量比去年大大增加。现在各地农民正冒着严寒，继续往地里运送肥料。到目前为止，已经在准备春播的耕地上施用了一千四百万吨天然肥料，超过计划40％。
    现在，罗马尼亚全国的选种工作已经完成20％。今年选用的多半是高产的品种。
    罗马尼亚今年将新增加一万多台拖拉机和其它大量的农业机器。现在，各地机器拖拉机站开办了许多训练班，培养使用农业机器的技术干部。在全国农村中还展开了学习农业技术的活动。今年有五十六万人参加了学习农业和饲畜业技术的短期训练班，比去年多十万人。
