Supply agricultural production materials faster and better
Actively supplying production materials to support agricultural production is an extremely important task for the commercial sector. This year, the continued leap forward in China's agriculture and the technical reform and transformation of agriculture have placed a series of new demands on the commercial sector.

Large quantities, diverse varieties, and the need for early supply are the characteristics of this year's agricultural needs for production materials. This year, the agricultural need for production materials greatly exceeds that of previous years. According to a survey of some people's communes in Guizhou Province, investment in the purchase of production materials this year will increase by more than 80% compared to last year. In Qingya and Baisha brigades of Dapu Commune, Hengshan County, Hunan Province, the need for agricultural tools alone has increased by more than 50% compared to the same period last year. Similar surveys have been conducted in other places, and the percentage increase in some communes far exceeds these figures. With the further development of diversified operations, not only does agriculture need a large amount of production materials, but animal husbandry, fisheries, transportation, sideline occupations, forestry, etc., also need a large amount of production materials. Among the production materials needed for agriculture this year, the proportion of modern machinery and improved agricultural tools will increase in addition to general small agricultural tools. Due to the improvement of agricultural production levels, the rural areas urgently need improved agricultural tools such as deep plows, improved waterwheels, and rice transplanters. The agricultural need for production materials is earlier this year than in previous years. The thorough implementation of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture and the continuous reform of farming methods have led to an earlier agricultural season this year. Therefore, the supply of production materials must be ahead of the season to meet the needs of agricultural production.

These characteristics of agricultural demand for production materials reflect the thriving scene of vigorous development in China's agricultural production. How to do a good job in supplying production materials according to this new situation and support the continued leap forward in agriculture is the most important political and economic task for the commercial sector at present.

The commercial sector has more favorable conditions this year to complete the supply of agricultural production materials than in previous years. After two consecutive years of great leaps forward, China's industrial production has made great progress, the material foundation has become much stronger than before, and the state can allocate more steel for agricultural production needs; large and medium-sized agricultural machinery factories that provide technical equipment for agriculture have also been put into production one after another, and the products provided for agriculture this year will be much more than in the past. The Xining Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Machinery Factory in Qinghai produced more than 1,300 six-row seeders in the first twenty-seven days of this year, equivalent to three-quarters of the total production of the province in the first quarter of last year. Of course, although more modern agricultural machinery will be produced this year than in previous years, it is still insufficient for the needs of the vast rural areas. This year and in the next two or three years, modern agricultural equipment can only be distributed more in key areas and cannot universally meet the needs. Therefore, the commercial sector must adopt the principle of "combining indigenous and foreign methods" in organizing the supply of agricultural production materials. That is to say, on the one hand, the commercial sector should actively cooperate with relevant units to ensure the timely supply of modern equipment produced under the unified state plan, including agricultural machinery, irrigation and drainage machinery, transportation tools, fertilizers, pesticides, etc.; on the other hand, and more importantly, it must also take the initiative to organize and assist local industries, especially county and commune industries, according to the principle of "local materials, local production, and local supply," make full use of local iron and steel to vigorously produce small agricultural tools and improved agricultural tools that have been identified, produce various local pesticides, local fertilizers, and other production materials needed locally. The commercial sector should also do a good job in the allocation and adjustment of various seeds, seedlings, and draught animals. The commercial departments of Henan, Shanxi, and Fujian provinces have currently organized local industries to produce more than 65 million pieces of various small agricultural tools, equivalent to 76% of the total amount of small agricultural tools required by these three provinces in the spring and summer seasons. The Shaoxing Commercial Department in Zhejiang Province helped local commune-run and county-run industries manufacture a large number of agricultural production materials such as deep plows, calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer, and feed crushers. By the end of January, more than 90% of the improved agricultural tools, fertilizers, and pesticides needed for spring plowing in the county had been prepared. "Before the troops move, food and fodder must go first," this spirit of actively supporting agriculture is worth learning.

Compared with old-fashioned agricultural tools, modern agricultural machinery and even improved agricultural tools are more complex in structure. Therefore, the commercial sector should also impart usage techniques to farmers while supplying these production materials, which is also an important task. The commercial sector should cooperate with relevant departments to organize technical forces to teach the masses installation, use, repair, and other techniques through short-term training classes, on-site meetings, and other methods, and help people's communes train various technical talents. For various new technologies, commercial workers can also adopt the method of first being students and then being teachers to spread the technology.

Now, spring plowing has begun in the south, and the north will also enter the spring plowing season one after another. The commercial sector should promptly supply the production materials needed for spring plowing, spring sowing, and spring irrigation, and actively organize relevant industries to help people's communes manufacture and repair various small agricultural tools and transportation tools to meet the needs of spring plowing production. There was little rain and snow last winter, and commercial departments in various places should quickly prepare irrigation machinery and supply it as soon as possible in order to strive for a greater harvest this summer. The supply and service work of production and living materials for water conservancy construction sites must be done well from beginning to end and continue to be done well. Pig raising is the best way to solve the fertilizer problem and is an extremely important measure for increasing agricultural production. In order to promote the greater development of pig raising this year, the commercial sector should actively help people's communes solve problems such as epidemic prevention, breeding piglets, and feed, and strive to do a good job in supplying feed processing tools and medicines. For other rural production, the commercial department should also consider the time, place, and industry, and try every means to supply production materials and support the continued leap forward in agricultural production. While supplying various production materials, it is also necessary to do a good job in supplying the various living materials needed in rural areas, which is also a very important aspect of the commercial sector's support for agriculture.

The task of the commercial sector to support agricultural production is heavy. To complete this task, it is necessary to launch a mass movement on a large scale. The supply of agricultural production materials is related to all aspects of the commercial sector, such as procurement, supply and marketing, storage, and transportation. Therefore, it is necessary to widely mobilize the masses, fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of commercial workers, and consciously and actively serve to support agriculture. Competitions should be organized among employees around the central task of a period, set up pacesetters, insert red flags, and continuously organize exchanges of experience and comprehensively promote them to make the work of supporting agricultural production better and better. Since the task of supporting agricultural production and supplying production materials must be jointly completed by industrial, commercial, transportation, and other departments, industrial, transportation, and other departments should cooperate closely with the commercial sector, promote the communist style, cooperate with each other, and promote each other. More importantly, the commercial sector should proceed from meeting the needs of agricultural production, go deep into the countryside, promptly understand the specific requirements of different regions, understand the problems that need to be solved urgently in agricultural production in various places, and give timely support. Go all out, aim high, give full play to the pivotal role of the commercial sector in the national economy, launch mass movements on a large scale, and widely organize cooperation. These are the most important experiences of the continuous great leap forward in commercial work in the past two years. This year, as long as the party committees at all levels strengthen their leadership over commercial work, adhere to the principle of putting politics in command, and vigorously launch a mass movement centered on the supply of agricultural production materials, and do everything possible to support agriculture, the commercial work this year will definitely be done even better than last year.

    更快更好地供应农业生产资料
    积极供应生产资料支援农业生产，是商业部门的一项极其重要的任务。今年我国农业的继续跃进和农业的技术改革和改造对商业部门提出了一系列新的要求。
    数量大、品种多、要求提早供应，这是今年农业对生产资料的需要的特点。今年，农业对生产资料的需要大大超过了往年。根据贵州省一些人民公社的调查，今年购买生产资料的投资将比去年增长80％以上。湖南省衡山县大浦公社青鸦、白沙等大队，仅对大小农具一项的需要，就比去年同期增长50％以上。其他地方也有类似的调查，其中有些公社增长的百分比还远远超过这些数字。随着多种经营的进一步开展，不仅农业需要大量生产资料，畜牧业、渔业、运输、副业、林业等等，也需要大量的生产资料。今年农业所需要的生产资料之中，除了一般小农具以外，现代化机械设备和改良农具的比重将有所增加。由于农业生产水平的提高，农村对改良农具如深耕犁、改良水车、插秧机等的需要是迫切的。农业对生产资料的需要，在时间上比往年要早。农业八字宪法的深入贯彻执行，耕作方法的不断改革，使得今年农时季节提早到来。因此，生产资料的供应工作必须赶在季节的前面，满足农业生产的需要。
    农业对生产资料的需要所显示的这些特点，反映了我国农业生产蓬勃发展的兴旺景象。如何根据这种新的形势作好生产资料的供应工作，支援农业的继续跃进，对商业部门来说，是目前头等紧要的政治任务和经济任务。
    完成对农业生产资料的供应工作，今年商业部门有着比往年更为有利的条件。经过连续两年的大跃进，我国的工业生产有了巨大的发展，物质基础已较前大为雄厚，国家能够拨出较多的钢铁供农业生产需要；为农业提供技术装备的大型中型农业机械厂，也已经陆续生产，今年为农业提供的产品将比过去要多得多。青海西宁农牧机械厂在今年开始的二十七天中，就生产了一千三百多部六行播种机，相当于去年第一季度全省生产总量的四分之三。当然，今年现代化农业机械尽管比往年要生产得多，但对广大农村的需要来讲，还是不足的。今年乃至今后的三两年内，现代农业装备还只能是较多地分配在重点地区，不可能普遍地满足需要。因此，商业部门组织农业生产资料的供应，就必须采取“土洋并举”的方针。这就是说，一方面，商业部门对于国家统一安排生产的现代化装备，包括农业机具、排灌机械、运输工具、化肥、农药等等，应该积极和有关单位协作，及时作好供应工作；另一方面，也是更重要的一方面，还必须根据“就地取材、就地生产、就地供应”的原则，主动组织和援助地方工业特别是县和公社工业，充分利用土铁土钢，大力生产小农具和经过鉴定的改良农具，生产各种土农药、土化肥以及当地需要的其他生产资料。商业部门还应该做好各种种籽、种苗和耕畜等的调拨和调剂工作。河南、山西、福建三省商业部门目前已经组织地方工业生产了各种小农具六千五百多万件，相当于这三个省春夏两季所需小农具总量的76％。浙江省绍兴商业部门帮助当地社办和县办工业制出了大批深耕犁、钙镁磷肥、饲料粉碎机等农业生产资料，到1月底，全县春耕生产所需要的改良农具和化肥、农药，就已备齐90％以上。兵马未动，粮草先行，这种主动支援农业的精神是值得学习的。
    现代化的农业机械以至改良农具，与旧式农具比较起来，构造都比较复杂。因此，商业部门在供应这些生产资料的同时，还应当向农民传授使用技术，这也是一项重要的工作。商业部门应该同有关部门协作，组织技术力量，通过举办短期训练班、现场会议等方式，向群众传授安装、使用、修理等技术，帮助人民公社培养各种技术人材。对于各种新的技术，商业工作人员还可以采取先当学生、后当先生的办法，把技术传播出去。
    现在，南方春耕已经开始，北方也将陆续进入春耕季节。商业部门应该及时地把春耕、春种、春灌所需要的生产资料供应下去，积极组织有关行业帮助人民公社制造和修补各种小农具、运输工具，以满足春耕生产的需要。去冬雨雪较少，各地商业部门应当迅速准备好灌溉机具，及早供应，以争取今年夏季的更大丰收。水利建设工地的生产资料、生活资料的供应工作和服务工作，必须善始善终，继续作好。养猪是解决肥料问题最好的办法，是农业增产的极其重要的措施。为了促进今年养猪事业的更大发展，当前商业部门应该积极帮助人民公社解决防疫、繁殖仔猪、饲料等问题，努力作好饲料加工工具和药品的供应工作。对于农村的其他生产，商业部也应该因时、因地、因业制宜，想尽各种办法，供应生产资料，支援农业生产继续跃进。在供应各种生产资料的同时，还需要把农村所需要的各种生活资料的供应工作做好，这也是商业部门支援农业的一个很重要的方面。
    商业部门支援农业生产的任务是繁重的。完成这一任务，必须大搞群众运动。供应农业生产资料，关系到商业部门采购、供销、储存、调运等各个环节，因此必须广泛发动群众，把商业工作人员的积极性和创造性充分调动起来，自觉地积极地为支援农业服务。应当围绕一个时期的中心任务，组织职工群众开展竞赛，立标兵，插红旗，并且不断组织交流经验，全面推广，把支援农业生产的工作越作越好。由于支援农业生产、供应生产资料的任务，必须是由工业、商业、交通运输等部门共同完成，因此，工业、交通运输等部门应该同商业部门通力合作，发扬共产主义风格，相互协作，相互促进。更重要的是，商业部门要从满足农业生产的需要出发，深入农村，及时了解不同地区的具体要求，了解各地农业生产急待解决的问题，及时地给以支援。鼓足干劲，力争上游，充分发挥商业部门在国民经济中的枢纽作用，大搞群众运动和广泛组织协作，是两年来商业工作连续大跃进的最重要的经验，今年只要各级党委加强对商业工作的领导，坚持实行政治挂帅，轰轰烈烈地开展一个以供应农业生产资料为中心的群众运动，千方百计支援农业，今年的商业工作就一定作得比去年更加出色。
