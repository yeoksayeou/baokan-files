Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, February 1st: The Albanian Telegraph Agency issued a statement on January 31st, accusing the Yugoslav authorities of deliberately delaying the convening of the Third Regular Session of the Albanian-Yugoslav Water Conservancy and Economic Commission, which had been agreed upon long ago by both sides.

The statement pointed out that the regulations of the Water Conservancy and Economic Commission adopted by both parties stipulate that the Third Regular Session of the Water Conservancy and Economic Commission would be held in Belgrade in the second half of February 1960. According to the regulations, the host country should notify the other party of the meeting and agenda two months in advance, but Albania has not yet received any notification from Yugoslavia.

The statement criticized a statement made by a spokesman for the Yugoslav Secretariat of Foreign Affairs at a press conference on January 9th. He insisted that Albania had ignored Yugoslavia’s proposal of September 1, 1959, to Albania concerning convening a meeting of the Bilateral Water Conservancy and Economic Commission to discuss water conservancy and economic issues, in Albania’s note of December 22, 1959, protesting the Yugoslav government’s violation of the bilateral agreement on water conservancy issues. The statement said that the Albanian Telegraph Agency inquired with the Albanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ascertain the truth. Facts showed that the Yugoslav spokesman’s statement was intended to deceive public opinion. The Yugoslav government had not made any proposal to convene a commission meeting.

The statement said that, not only that, but the Yugoslav government also deliberately delayed the convening of the Third Regular Session of the commission. This once again proves that it deliberately does not comply with the agreement and the regulations of the Water Conservancy and Economic Commission and continues to take unilateral actions that seriously infringe upon Albania’s interests. Yugoslavia should bear full responsibility for all consequences arising from such actions.

The statement reiterated that the Albanian side is fully entitled to take measures aimed at defending Albania's interests and will utilize the hydropower of Lake Pogradec within its territory to build hydroelectric power stations. It was previously reported that Albania and Yugoslavia signed an agreement in December 1956 to jointly utilize the water resources in the border region shared by the two countries. Both parties guaranteed to study and resolve all water conservancy and economic issues in accordance with the provisions of the agreement. However, Yugoslavia, without consultation with both parties, arbitrarily built a hydroelectric power station on the Black Drin River and carried out soil improvement projects on the shores of Lake Pogradec. To this end, the Albanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the Yugoslav Embassy on December 22, 1959, protesting the South's arbitrary behavior.

### 阿尔巴尼亚通讯社发表声明  指责南斯拉夫拖延讨论两国水利问题

    阿尔巴尼亚通讯社发表声明
    指责南斯拉夫拖延讨论两国水利问题
    新华社地拉那1日电　阿尔巴尼亚通讯社1月31日发表声明，指责南斯拉夫当局故意拖延召开阿南双方早已确定的阿南水利经济委员会第三次常会。
    声明指出，双方通过的水利经济委员会有关条例规定，将在1960年2月下半月在贝尔格莱德召开水利经济委员会第三次常会。按照条例的规定，东道国应在两个月以前就把会议和日程通知对方，但直到现在阿尔巴尼亚还未接到南斯拉夫方面的通知。
    声明指责南斯拉夫外交秘书处发言人于1月9日在记者招待会上的这样一种说法，他硬说，在阿尔巴尼亚1959年12月22日抗议南斯拉夫政府破坏两国关于水利问题协定的照会中，对于南斯拉夫1959年9月1日致阿尔巴尼亚的照会中提出的关于召集两国水利经济委员会会议，以讨论水利经济问题的建议置之不理。声明说，阿尔巴尼亚通讯社向阿尔巴尼亚外交部探询事情真相，事实表明，南斯拉夫发言人的这种说法的目的，在于欺骗公众舆论。南斯拉夫政府根本没有提出召集委员会会议的任何建议。
    声明说，不但如此，南斯拉夫政府还故意拖延召开委员会的第三次常会。这再次证明它故意不遵守协定和水利经济委员会的条例，并且继续进行单方面的行动，严重地侵犯了阿尔巴尼亚的利益。南斯拉夫应对这种行动所引起的一切后果负完全责任。
    声明重申：阿尔巴尼亚方面完全有权采取旨在保卫阿尔巴尼亚利益的措施，并将利用在本国境内的波格腊德次湖的水力来建设水电站。前已报道，阿南两国为了共同利用两国所共有的边境地区的水利资源，曾在1956年12月签订了一项协定，双方保证根据协定的条文研究和解决有关水利经济的一切问题。但是，南斯拉夫未经双方协商就擅自在黑德林河上修建水电站，并在波格腊德次湖畔进行土壤改良工程。为此，阿尔巴尼亚外交部曾于1959年12月22日照会南斯拉夫公使馆，抗议南方的这种专横行为。
