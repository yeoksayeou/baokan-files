    Contact-type Automatic Locomotive Signal
    Train Crew No Longer Needs to Lean Out to Observe Signals

    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin Electric - Engineering and technical personnel from the Harbin Railway Bureau's Scientific and Technological Research Institute, with the close assistance of relevant units, have successfully developed a "contact-type automatic locomotive signal."

    With this automatic signal, crew members can know in the cab whether the entrance signal is red, yellow, or green, and no longer need to stick their heads out in wind, snow, or rain to observe signals. This ensures driving safety and increases driving speed.

    Recently, the Ministry of Railways held a national on-site meeting on automatic locomotive signals at this bureau to promote this experience.

    接触式机车自动信号
    乘务员不用探出头了望信号了
    据新华社哈尔滨电　哈尔滨铁路局科学技术研究所工程技术人员在有关单位的密切协助下，研究成功了“接触式机车自动信号”。
    有了这个自动信号，乘务员在驾驶室里就知道进站信号是红色、黄色或绿色，不需要再在风、雪、雨天伸出头来了望信号了。这就保证了行车安全，提高了行驶速度。
    最近铁道部在这个局召开了全国机车自动信号现场会议，推广这一经验。
