Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 8th: Vietnam Labor Youth League Central Committee's newspaper "Tien Phong" published a commentary today stating that just as US imperialism is doing everything possible to create conflicts between Southeast Asian countries and undermine the unity, friendship, and cooperation of Asian and African countries, the signing of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the agreement on border issues is of particular significance.

The commentary pointed out that US imperialism knows that the strengthening and consolidation of the unity and cooperation of the Asian countries' people is not conducive to their domination and war conspiracies. Therefore, US imperialism clamors that the principle of peaceful coexistence is no longer being respected and tries its best to provoke relations between China and other Asian countries. The commentary said that the signing of the Sino-Burmese treaty and agreement completely exposes the above-mentioned fallacies and sabotage plots of US imperialism.

The commentary emphasized that "the recently signed treaty and agreement between China and Burma are a new model of friendly cooperation and peaceful coexistence among Asian countries."

The commentary concluded, "The Vietnamese people and youth warmly welcome the new progress in Sino-Burmese relations. We believe that the spirit of resolving disputes among Asian nations through peaceful consultation and promoting mutual understanding among these countries will develop increasingly."

    越南“先锋报”发表评论指出
    中缅条约揭穿美国挑拨阴谋
    新华社河内8日电　越南劳动青年团中央机关报“先锋报”今天发表评论说，正当美帝国主义千方百计地制造东南亚各国之间的冲突，破坏亚非各国的团结、友谊和合作的时候，中缅签订友好和互不侵犯条约和关于边界问题的协定具有特别重大的意义。
    评论指出，美帝国主义知道，亚洲各国人民的团结和合作的加强与巩固，不利于它们的统治和战争的阴谋。因此，美帝国主义就叫嚷什么和平共处的原则现在得不到尊重了。并且竭力挑拨中国同其他亚洲国家之间的关系。评论说，中缅条约和协定的签订完全揭穿了美帝国主义的上述谬论和破坏阴谋。
    评论强调指出，“中缅两国最近签订的条约和协定是亚洲各国友好合作和和平共处的新典范”。
    评论最后说，“越南人民和青年热烈欢迎中缅关系中的新进展。我们相信，通过和平协商来解决亚洲各民族之间的争端和促进这些国家互相谅解的精神，将日益发展”。
