Roads Form a Network, Guoluo Reaches Out in All Directions:
Thousands of Miles of Grassland Allow Cars to Travel Unimpeded
    (From Our Newspaper) The Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture has basically completed its road network. Currently, transportation here is well-developed in all directions, and very convenient.

    Before liberation, transportation in Guoluo was extremely inconvenient. In the vast territory of over 140,000 square kilometers, there was not a single highway, not even a road suitable for large vehicles, only two post roads for pedestrians. A round trip from Jimai to Xining took more than forty days. Local chieftains divided up the territory, and ordinary herders had to pay "road money" to travel from one tribe to another. On the difficult transportation lines, the only means of transport was yaks. It took forty-six days for yaks to transport highland barley from Jimai to Aba in Sichuan. Local herders rarely saw industrial products. The wool, hides, medicinal materials, and other local specialties produced here could not be transported out and were left to rot.

    After liberation, the Party and the People's Government vigorously helped the Guoluo Tibetan people to build roads, which enabled the road transportation industry to develop rapidly. In 1956, a simple highway was built from Huashi Gorge to Jimai, allowing the Tibetan people on the Guoluo grasslands to see cars for the first time. In the past, yak transport from Huashi Gorge to Jimai took five to seven days, but now it only takes one day. By the end of 1958, a total of 499 kilometers of highways had been built in the prefecture, and the Huaji Highway was widened and maintained, greatly improving driving efficiency. In 1959, under the leadership of the Party, the construction units of Guoluo highway vigorously promoted technological innovation and carried out appraisal competitions. More than 550 kilometers of new highways were built throughout the prefecture, more than the total built in all years since liberation. At present, the total mileage of highways open to traffic in the prefecture has reached 1,066 kilometers, and the first bridge on the upper reaches of the Yellow River, the Jimai Bridge, has been built. Now all six counties and fourteen communes in the autonomous prefecture have access to cars. In the past, yaks toiled day and night on the transportation lines of the Guoluo grasslands, but today they have been replaced by cars. A round trip from Jimai to Xining now only takes four days. Last year, cars transported more than 235,000 kilograms of various medicinal materials, 350,000 hides, 260,000 kilograms of wool and cattle hair, nearly 70,000 kilograms of meat, and 427,000 kilograms of other materials from this autonomous prefecture; at the same time, a large number of steel, coal, coke, grain, and daily necessities were transported in. The rapid development of road transportation has greatly promoted the development of animal husbandry, agriculture, and sideline production in the Guoluo area and the improvement of people's lives.

    路路连成网　果洛通四方
    千里草原汽车畅行无阻
    本报讯　果洛藏族自治州已基本上建成了公路网。目前，这里交通四通八达，十分方便。
    解放前，果洛交通极不方便。在十四万余平方公里的辽阔土地上，没有一条公路，连一条能走大车的大道也没有，只有两条行人驿道。从吉迈到西宁，往返一次要四十多天。牧主头人割据一方，一般牧民从这个部落到那个部落还要“买路钱”。在艰难的运输线上，运输工具全靠牦牛。从吉迈运青稞到四川阿坝，牦牛往返得四十六天。当地牧民很少见过工业产品。这里出产的羊毛、皮张和药材等土特产品，运不出去，只有任其霉烂。
    解放后，党和人民政府大力帮助果洛藏族人民进行公路建设，使公路运输事业得到了迅速发展。1956年修建了花石峡通吉迈的简易公路，使果洛草原上的藏族人民第一次见到了汽车。过去，从花石峡到吉迈牦牛运输要五至七天时间，现在只要一天。到1958年底，全州共建成公路四百九十九公里，并对花吉公路进行加宽护养，使行车效率大大提高。1959年，果洛公路建设各施工单位，在党的领导下，大闹技术革新，开展评比竞赛，全州新修公路五百五十多公里，比解放后历年来修建公路的总和还要多。目前，全州公路通车里程已达一千零六十六公里，并修起了黄河上游第一桥——吉迈大桥。现在全自治州六个县和十四个公社都已通行汽车。过去在果洛草原运输线上日夜奔忙的牦牛，今天已经被汽车代替。从吉迈到西宁往返一次只要四天时间。去年，汽车从这个自治州运出各类药材二十三万五千多公斤，皮张三十五万张，羊毛、牛毛二十六万公斤，肉类近七万公斤，其他物资四十二万七千公斤；同时运进了大批钢材、煤炭、焦炭、粮食和日用品。公路交通运输事业的迅速发展，大大促进了果洛地区牧农副业生产的发展和人民生活的改善。（附图片）
