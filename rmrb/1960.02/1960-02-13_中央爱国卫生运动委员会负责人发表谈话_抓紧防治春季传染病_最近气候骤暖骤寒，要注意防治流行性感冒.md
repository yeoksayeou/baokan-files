Xinhua News Agency, 12th. Recently, the climate has gradually warmed, but due to occasional cold waves, it is suddenly hot and cold. The person in charge of the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter on the issues that the mass health campaign should pay attention to during this period, saying: On the basis of the achievements made in the winter patriotic health campaign before the Spring Festival, according to seasonal climate changes and industrial and agricultural production conditions, we must currently focus on preventing and controlling spring infectious diseases, and combine manure accumulation with fundamental health work.

The person in charge said that in order to prevent and control winter and spring epidemics, various effective measures have been taken throughout the country since the beginning of winter to vigorously carry out prevention, and the incidence of diseases such as influenza and measles has decreased significantly compared with previous years. Most winter and spring infectious diseases are transmitted through the respiratory tract and are closely related to climate changes. Recently, the climate has suddenly warmed and cooled, which can easily cause colds and influenza. As the climate gradually warms, people may also relax their cold protection work. Therefore, we must not have any sense of complacency or slackness in preventing and controlling spring epidemics. We must do a good job in keeping warm and preventing dampness after the spring thaw, so as to effectively prevent colds, upper respiratory tract inflammation, and common spring diseases such as influenza, measles, pneumonia, diphtheria, and pertussis: at the same time, we must continue to do a good job in safety and hygiene work such as preventing freezing, fire, and gas poisoning to ensure the health of people and livestock. In particular, collective production and living units such as water conservancy construction sites, construction sites, factories, mines, schools, and people's communes should pay attention to doing a good job in spring disease prevention, arrange work and rest, carry out mass disease prevention campaigns, thoroughly carry out health publicity and education, earnestly implement preventive measures, and ensure strong personnel and livestock to promote the high-speed development of production and construction.

The person in charge said that cooperating with the current manure accumulation and fertilizer production to prepare for spring plowing and vigorously carrying out the patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests is an important aspect of health serving production. The health campaign should focus on manure accumulation, vigorously carry out cleaning sweeps, improve toilets, manure pits, pig and cattle pens, and ditches, clean up mosquito and fly breeding grounds, and carry out harmless treatment of feces and garbage. Through these activities, on the one hand, mosquitoes and flies will not have the opportunity to breed, and at the same time, fertilizer sources will be developed for spring plowing production, and a large amount of high-quality and high-efficiency fertilizer will be accumulated.

The person in charge said that as winter passes and spring arrives, the stage where the activities of the four pests are restricted is gradually shortening, and mosquitoes and flies hibernating through the winter will soon begin to breed. Seizing the current opportunity to vigorously accumulate manure and produce fertilizer, thoroughly eliminate mosquito and fly breeding grounds, vigorously carry out basic health construction, destroy mosquito and fly nests, and not allow mosquitoes and flies to have the opportunity to breed and emerge will achieve twice the result with half the effort. Therefore, the current health campaign in various places must firmly grasp the link of manure accumulation. Health departments and relevant departments should closely cooperate and take measures to make health serve production, so as to both accumulate more fertilizer and improve health. Health departments should actively do a good job in providing advice and strengthening technical guidance in basic health construction and harmless treatment of feces and garbage. It is necessary to timely summarize and promote the masses' experience in establishing "hygienic villages" and "hygienic production brigades," as well as strengthening manure management starting from manufacturing "hygienic soil fertilizer" and "hygienic water fertilizer," and through the spring manure accumulation campaign, greatly promote fundamental health work and lay the foundation for this year's in-depth patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests and eliminate diseases.

    中央爱国卫生运动委员会负责人发表谈话
    抓紧防治春季传染病
    最近气候骤暖骤寒，要注意防治流行性感冒
    新华社12日讯　最近，气候逐渐转暖，但由于时有寒潮，忽冷忽热。中央爱国卫生运动委员会负责人就这个时期群众性卫生运动应注意的问题，向新华社记者发表谈话说：在春节前冬季爱国卫生运动取得的成绩的基础上，根据季节气候的变化和工农业生产的情况，当前特别要抓紧防治春季传染病，结合积肥进行卫生治本工作。
    负责人说，对于防治冬春季流行病，全国各地从入冬以来就采取了各种有效措施，大力进行预防，流行性感冒、麻疹等疾病发病率都比往年有显著降低。冬春季传染病多数是经过呼吸道传染的，与气候的变化有很大关系，最近气候骤暖骤寒，很容易造成伤风感冒和流行性感冒等病的发生。由于气候逐渐转暖，人们也可能放松防寒工作。因此，当前对防治春季流行病不能有任何麻痹松懈情绪，要作好保暖和春暖化冻后防潮湿等工作，以便确实有效地防止伤风感冒、上呼吸道炎症和流行性感冒、麻疹、肺炎、白喉、百日咳等春季常见疾病的发生流行：同时也要继续作好防冻、防火、防煤气中毒等安全卫生工作，以保证人畜的健康。特别是水利工地、建筑工地、厂矿、学校和人民公社等集体生产生活的单位，更应该注意搞好春季的防病工作，做好劳逸安排，并应开展群众性防病运动，深入开展卫生宣传教育，认真贯彻预防措施，保证人强马壮，促进生产建设的高速度发展。
    负责人说，配合当前积肥造肥备耕工作大搞除四害讲卫生运动，是卫生为生产服务的一个重要的方面。卫生运动应该围绕积肥，大搞清洁扫除，改良厕所、粪坑、猪牛栏圈和沟渠，清理蚊蝇孳生场所，对粪便垃圾进行无害化处理，通过这些活动，一方面使蚊蝇得不到繁殖的机会，同时又为春耕生产开辟肥源，积累大量质量好、肥效高的肥料。
    负责人说，冬去春来，四害活动受到限制的阶段日渐缩短，蛰伏越冬的蚊蝇即将开始孳生繁殖，抓紧目前大搞积肥造肥时机，彻底清除蚊蝇孳生场所，大搞卫生基本建设，捣毁蚊蝇老窠，不让蚊蝇有孳生露头的机会，就能收到事半功倍的效果。因此，当前各地开展卫生运动必须紧紧抓住积肥这个环节，卫生部门和有关部门密切协作，采取措施，使卫生为生产服务，做到既多积肥料又搞好卫生。卫生部门要积极做好参谋工作，加强对卫生基本建设和对粪便垃圾进行无害化处理等方面的技术指导工作。要及时总结和推广群众建立“卫生村”、“卫生生产大队”以及从制造“卫生土肥”、“卫生水肥”出发来加强粪便管理等经验，通过春季积肥运动，把卫生治本工作大大推进一步，为今年深入开展除四害讲卫生和消灭疾病工作打下基础。
