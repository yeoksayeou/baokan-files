The people's communes across the country have achieved comprehensive and extremely brilliant achievements in winter ploughing, winter repair, winter modification, winter accumulation, and winter management since last winter. This has made the first contribution to the continuous leap forward in agricultural production this year, and has provided a better foundation for this year's spring ploughing production and striving for a bumper summer harvest than in the previous two years.

The focus of the "Five Winters" work is water and fertilizer, and the achievements in these two areas are particularly prominent. As of now, more than 3.1 million large and small farmland water conservancy projects, including reservoirs, ponds, river channels, and motor wells, have been completed nationwide, and it is estimated that the irrigated area can be expanded and improved by about 200 million mu. Many "dead corner" areas where water conservancy projects have been built less frequently in the past have also built a large number of small projects last winter, changing their backward appearance. The fertilizer accumulation campaign last winter was very different from previous years: in addition to accumulating general fertilizers, the broad masses also carried out a large-scale pig-raising and fertilizer accumulation campaign, ensuring that farm manure was accumulated quickly, well, and in large quantities. According to preliminary statistics, the amount of fertilizer accumulated in rural areas nationwide has reached more than 200 billion dan, and the average amount of farm manure per mu of spring-sown arable land and summer-harvested crops nationwide has exceeded 100 dan. The quality of fertilizer is generally better than last year, and high-quality pig manure and other fertilizers generally account for about one-third.

The scale of winter ploughing and farmland capital construction to improve soil and transform various low-yield fields is larger than in previous years. The total winter ploughing area (including a part of the autumn ploughing area last autumn) reached more than 1.1 billion mu, of which more than 60% met the requirements for deep ploughing. Many areas have basically realized the slogan of "no bare land over winter". A total of more than 100 million mu of various cultivated land have been preliminarily improved by using winter leisure time, which is 70% more than in the previous winter and spring.

Field management of overwintering crops was also started earlier and more carefully last winter. Field management of overwintering crops in winter is an important winter activity proposed after the Great Leap Forward in 1958. In the winter of 1957, only a part of the wheat fields were top-dressed and watered according to the requirements of "five waters and three fertilizers", and the real fine management work only began after the wheat turned green. After the overwintering crops were sown last winter, all localities paid close attention to management work and conducted a national general inspection. According to incomplete statistics, about 300 million mu of winter wheat have been top-dressed nationwide, and a considerable part of the wheat fields have been winter-irrigated.

Due to the fast and good work in the "Five Winters," good conditions have been prepared for this year's spring ploughing production and summer harvest. This year's spring sowing not only has better water and fertilizer conditions, but also fewer field pests. The good work of the "Five Winters" has also prompted the preparation work such as fertilizer delivery and land preparation in various places to be earlier than in previous years. Early rice seedling raising has been advanced in various parts of the South. About half of the fertilizer in Heilongjiang and Hebei provinces has been delivered to the fields. Wuchang and other counties in Heilongjiang Province have delivered all the fertilizer for spring-sown fields in advance. The preparation work in various places has taken the initiative and won time, changing the situation in previous years when fertilizer accumulation and delivery during the spring ploughing season occupied too much labor and delayed agricultural time. This will play a decisive role in doing a good job in this year's spring ploughing production work.

The good growth of various overwintering crops is the foundation for striving for a bumper summer harvest this year. Due to the large-scale construction of water conservancy projects and pig-raising and fertilizer accumulation, the area of top-dressing and irrigation for various overwintering crops such as wheat, rapeseed, and miscellaneous grains this year has been greatly expanded compared with previous years. The area of winter wheat top-dressing has increased by one-third compared with the same period last year. The area of winter wheat irrigation in ten provinces including Henan and Shandong has increased by more than 30 million mu compared with last year. Henan Province, which ranks first in the country in winter wheat planting, has generally top-dressed wheat fields once, with 80% having been top-dressed twice, and 70% have been irrigated once, with about half having been irrigated twice. In addition to watering and top-dressing, various localities have done more detailed work in overwintering crops such as intertillage, weeding, frost prevention, and pest and disease prevention than in previous years. The overwintering crops in many provinces, cities, and districts have first and second class seedlings accounting for about 90%, and third class seedlings accounting for only about 10%.

The reason why the "Five Winters" work has achieved such good results is mainly because all localities have adhered to putting politics in command, carried out mass movements on a large scale, and fully utilized the superiority of the people's communes based on the experience of the Great Leap Forward in the previous two years. Since last winter, the Party committees in various localities have closely grasped the leadership of the "Five Winters" work. Under the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, the members of the people's communes in various places are full of energy, and they are practical, hardworking, and ingenious. Whether in water conservancy construction, pig-raising and fertilizer accumulation, winter ploughing and plowing, soil improvement, or field management, they have created many new advanced experiences and new tools, and have launched a high-quality and high-yield competition to catch up with each other, so that the "Five Winters" work has been done quickly and well.

    全国冬耕、冬修、冬改、冬积、冬管工作成就辉煌
    今年农业持续跃进基础雄厚
    水：已修成农田水利工程三百万处，可扩大和改善灌溉面积两亿亩
    肥：已积集肥料两千多亿担，优质的猪粪肥等一般占三分之一左右
    土：冬耕面积十一亿多亩，60％以上达到深耕要求，一亿多亩土壤经过改良
    新华社18日讯　全国人民公社去冬以来进行的冬耕、冬修、冬改、冬积和冬管工作，取得了全面的极其辉煌的成就，为今年农业生产的持续跃进立下了第一功，使今年的春耕生产和争取夏季大丰收具备了比以往两年更好的基础。
    五冬工作的中心是水、肥，这两项的成就特别突出。截至目前，全国已经修成包括水库、塘坝、河渠、机井等大小农田水利工程三百一十多万处，预计可扩大和改善灌溉面积两亿亩左右。不少历年兴修水利较少的“死角”地区，去冬也修了大量的小型工程，改变了落后面貌。去冬的积肥运动同往年大不一样：广大群众除积了一般的肥料外，还开展了大规模的养猪积肥运动，保证了农家肥积得又多、又快、又好。据初步统计，现在全国农村积肥数量达两千多亿担，全国春播耕地和夏收农作物平均每亩已有农家肥一百担以上。肥料质量普遍比去年好，优质的猪粪肥等，一般占三分之一左右。
    冬耕和改良土壤、改造各种低产田的农田基本建设工作，都比往年规模大。冬耕面积（包括一部分去秋的秋耕面积）共达十一亿多亩，其中达到深耕要求的占60％以上。许多地区基本实现了“不留白茬地过冬”的口号。利用冬季休闲，经过初步改良的各种耕地共达一亿多亩，比上年冬春多了70％。
    越冬作物田间管理工作去冬也抓得早、抓得细。冬季抓越冬作物的田间管理工作是1958年大跃进以后才提出的一项重要的冬活。1957年冬天只是根据“五水三肥”的要求对一部分麦田施了追肥和浇了水，真正精细的管理工作是小麦返青后才开始的。去冬的越冬作物播种后，各地对管理工作就抓得很紧，而且进行了一次全国性的大检查。据不完全的统计：全国约有三亿亩冬小麦施了追肥，并且有相当大的一部分麦田经过冬灌。
    由于五冬工作做得又快又好，对今年的春耕生产和夏季丰收已经准备了良好的条件。今年春播，不仅水和肥的条件更好，田间害虫也少。五冬工作好还促使今年各地送肥、整地等备耕工作较往年提早。南方各地提早了早稻育秧。黑龙江、河北两省已有一半左右的肥料送到了田里。黑龙江省五常等县已经把春播田的全部肥料提前送完。各地备耕工作争取了主动，赢得了时间，改变了往年春耕时期积肥送肥占用劳力过多耽误农时的情况，这将对作好今年的春耕生产工作起决定性的作用。
    各种越冬农作物生长良好是今年争取夏季大丰收的基础。由于大兴水利和养猪积肥，今年麦子、油菜、杂粮等各种越冬作物的追肥、灌水面积都比往年扩大很多。冬小麦追肥的面积比上年同期扩大三分之一。河南、山东等十个省冬小麦浇灌的面积，比上年扩大三千多万亩。种植冬小麦占全国第一位的河南省，麦田已普遍追过一遍肥，追两遍肥的达80％以上，有70％浇灌过一次水，浇灌过两次水的占一半左右。除浇水、追肥外，各地越冬作物的中耕、锄草、防冻、防病虫等工作都比往年作得细，许多省、市、区的越冬作物一、二类苗占90％左右，三类苗只占10％上下。
    五冬工作所以能够取得这样好的成就，主要是各地根据前两年大跃进的经验，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，并充分发挥了人民公社的优越性。去冬以来，各地党委一环紧扣一环地抓紧了五冬工作的领导。各地人民公社社员在党的八届八中全会反右倾、鼓干劲开展增产节约运动的号召下，个个干劲冲天，实干、苦干加巧干，无论兴修水利、养猪积肥、冬耕冬翻、改良土壤、田间管理等方面，都创造了不少新的先进经验和新工具，并且开展了你追我赶的优质高产竞赛，从而使五冬工作做得既快又好。
