Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee formulated the General Line of going all out, aiming high and achieving greater, faster, better and more economical results to build socialism. This is a brilliant example of creatively applying the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism to guide the specific practice of socialist construction in our country, and a epoch-making new development of Marxism-Leninism on the issue of socialist construction in our country. This line profoundly embodies the thought of uninterrupted revolution. We must master the theoretical weapon of uninterrupted revolution and possess the spirit of uninterrupted revolution in order to thoroughly adhere to the Party's General Line for socialist construction and promote the high-speed development of the cause of socialist construction.

The theory of uninterrupted revolution is a basic theory of Marxism-Leninism. In the view of Marxists, the objective world is constantly in the process of the unity and struggle of opposites, developing and changing endlessly. This is true of human society, and it is also true of the natural world. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: contradictions exist in the development process of all things, there is nothing that does not contain contradictions, without contradictions there would be no world; the mutual dependence and struggle of the contradictory aspects contained in all things determines the vitality of all things and promotes the development of all things. Comrade Mao Zedong used "metabolism" to describe the development process of things, pointing out to us: "Metabolism is a universal and eternally irresistible law in the universe"; "There are contradictions between the new and old aspects within any thing, forming a series of tortuous struggles. As a result of the struggle, the new aspect grows from small to large and rises to become the dominant thing; the old aspect shrinks from large to small and gradually moves towards extinction." The entire development process of the objective world is the process of metabolism, eliminating the old and bringing forth the new, as pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong. This process, whether in human society or in the natural world, is realized through tortuous and complex struggles. This is the basis of the Marxist-Leninist principle of uninterrupted revolution. To deny the theory of uninterrupted revolution and attempt to prevent the development process of objective things is actually a departure from Marxism-Leninism.

Of course, the theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of the stages of revolutionary development are dialectically unified, because the development process of the objective world follows the law of quantitative change leading to qualitative change. When things are in a relatively static process of quantitative change, they seem to be stable at a certain stage of development, but in fact, they are actively preparing for a qualitative change that will result in significant changes. When a qualitative change occurs, it crosses the old stage and enters a new stage, beginning a new process of quantitative change and preparing for a new qualitative change. This is true of all historical stages of human society, and it is even more true of the evolution of the Chinese revolution from the stage of democratic revolution to the stage of socialist revolution and socialist construction. The development of the revolutionary cause follows this law, constantly moving from one stage to another. Failure to recognize the inevitability of the development of things from quantitative change to qualitative change, and attempting to stop at a certain stage of revolutionary development and no longer move forward, will inevitably lead to rightist errors. Similarly, failure to recognize the process of quantitative change in the development of things, and denying the stage-based nature of revolutionary development, will inevitably lead to "leftist" errors.

Adhering to the theory of uninterrupted revolution and correctly grasping the dialectical unity of the theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of revolutionary stages is of decisive significance for implementing the Party's General Line for socialist construction, promoting the growth and development of the people's communes, and promoting the continuous leaps forward in agricultural production. As we look back on the tremendous achievements of agricultural production in Shandong and look forward to its bright future, we not only feel extraordinarily close to Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's teachings on uninterrupted revolution, but also more deeply appreciate the great significance of this theory in guiding our practice.

Since liberation, the development process of agricultural production in Shandong has been a process of uninterrupted revolution. In terms of grain, it has gradually changed from the so-called "grain-deficient households" in the past to self-sufficient households, and from "self-sufficient households" to self-sufficient and gradually prosperous. Many places have leaped from low yield to high yield, shattering the erroneous views of determinism and fatalism in the past. In 1949, the province's total grain output was 21.5 billion catties, increasing to 29.3 billion catties in 1956, and in the unprecedented Great Leap Forward of 1958, it increased to 38 billion catties. In 1959, despite encountering severe drought, it still achieved continuous leaps forward, breaking the historical convention of production decreases due to disasters. The process of our great development in agricultural production is also the process of the great revolution in agricultural relations of production, the process of the great revolution in agricultural production technology, and the process of people continuously liberating their minds and going all out.

Adapting to the development of productive forces, the timely transformation of relations of production in rural areas is a huge force in promoting the development of agricultural production. At present, in particular, fully utilizing the superiority of the people's communes, which are large in scale and of a high degree of public ownership, is of extremely great significance for promoting continuous leaps forward in agricultural production. Since liberation, after we completed the historical task of land reform, we did not allow the revolution to stagnate. Instead, following the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, we immediately launched the socialist transformation of agriculture. After interconnected development stages of mutual aid teams with socialist sprouts, semi-socialist elementary cooperatives, and fully socialist advanced cooperatives, we successfully transformed the individual ownership of working peasants and realized the socialist collective ownership of major means of production such as land, livestock, and large farm implements. The transformation of relations of production liberated productive forces, created conditions for implementing agricultural technology revolution and adopting advanced yield-increasing measures, thus powerfully promoting the development of agricultural production. Especially since the Party put forward the General Line for socialist construction in the spring of 1958, the situation of the all-round Great Leap Forward and the establishment of the people's communes have opened up infinitely broad prospects for the development of agricultural production and the improvement of agricultural production levels. Peasants described it this way when recalling and comparing: "Mutual aid teams used windlasses and walking plows, increasing production by a few percent each year; cooperatives installed liberation-style (waterwheels) and double-furrow plows, increasing production by 30 or 20 (catties) each year; people's communes have pumps and tractors, increasing production by hundreds (of catties) per turn." Based on their personal experience, peasants understand that the only way to quickly change the backwardness of "poverty and blankness" is the road of socialist collectivization and large-scale production pointed out by the Party. Especially after communization, because of the combination of workers, peasants, commerce, students and soldiers, the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production and fishery, the implementation of a distribution system combining wage system and supply system, and the establishment of various collective welfare undertakings, our agricultural production is even more able to leap forward on an unprecedented scale and speed.

The people's commune will be the best form for our country to realize two transitions, that is, from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people and from socialist society to communist society. Even in the future communist society, the people's commune will be an appropriate grassroots social organizational form. But this does not mean that the relations of production of the people's commune are already perfect and can stagnate. On the contrary, when productive forces develop to a certain stage, they will have certain contradictions with the existing relations of production of the people's commune. At that time, we must further improve the existing relations of production to make them compatible with the development of productive forces. In socialist society, relations of production and productive forces are always both compatible and contradictory. In the process of production development, we must constantly resolve contradictions and constantly seek adaptation, that is, to continuously carry out revolution. As pointed out in the Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party: "On the issue of the transition from socialism to communism, we cannot stop at the stage of socialism, but we cannot fall into the fantasy of transcending the stage of socialism and jumping into the stage of communism. We are Marxist-Leninist advocates of uninterrupted revolution. We believe that there is no Great Wall separating democratic revolution and socialist revolution, or socialism and communism, nor should there be. We are also Marxist-Leninist advocates of stages of revolutionary development. believe that different stages reflect qualitative changes in things, and these qualitatively different stages should not be confused."

We must correctly understand the dialectical unity of the theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development. At present, the people's commune implements a three-level ownership system, based on the basic ownership of the production team. In the future, it will gradually transition from the basic ownership of the production team to the basic ownership of the commune, from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people, and from socialist ownership by the whole people to communist ownership by the whole people. This is the inevitable trend of the development of the people's commune. We must not only recognize the important significance of gradual transition, be good at distinguishing these qualitatively different stages of development, and recognize the theory of stages of revolutionary development; but also clearly see the inevitable trend of this development, first create conditions for the transition from the basic ownership of the production team to the basic ownership of the commune, so that when conditions are ripe, this transition can be completed in a timely and smooth manner, to further liberate productive forces, promote the development of production, and create conditions for gradually completing the other transitions.

At present, the development of collective business undertakings and commune-run industries in people's communes; the development of collective welfare undertakings and the growth of the sprouts of distribution according to need in the implementation of the distribution system combining wage system and supply system; the promotion of large-area high-yield fields based on experimental fields; the establishment of various specialized production teams and permanent water conservancy construction teams throughout the commune; the implementation of three circles to the fields, establishing breeding bases according to squares and plots, combining animal husbandry production with large-scale agricultural cultivation; establishing various production bases and commodity bases in accordance with local conditions within the scope of the entire commune; the state supporting poor teams and poor communes to catch up with rich teams and rich communes economically; all of this is constantly eliminating the vestiges of small-scale production, powerfully promoting the continuous leaps forward in agricultural production, and also creating conditions for gradually realizing mechanized large-scale production and gradually promoting the transition of the people's commune.

The process of agricultural production development is the process of people fighting against nature. In this struggle, we must believe that the masses can liberate themselves and transform from slaves of nature to masters of nature. The potential of nature is infinite, and the ability of people to tap the potential of nature is also infinite. We must give full play to the subjective initiative of people with the spirit of uninterrupted revolution, understand nature, and transform nature. Under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, the broad masses of peasants, going all out and aiming high, with the revolutionary heroic spirit of making high mountains bow their heads and large rivers give way, opened the treasures of nature and obtained the continuous leaps forward in agricultural production. They stubbornly turned hills into plains, stubbornly turned sandy wasteland into fertile fields, stubbornly turned poor mountains and bad waters into green mountains and clear waters, stubbornly turned low yield into high yield, and stubbornly cut off the roaring Yellow River, driving it to irrigate farmland submissively. The tenacious revolutionary will and creative and innovative wisdom in conquering nature demonstrated by the masses of peasants under the leadership of the Party are the decisive factors for us to fully utilize the superiority of the people's communes, promote agricultural technology revolution, and realize sustained leaps forward in agriculture. The so-called "ideology produces matter" is the principle.

Right-leaning conservatives cannot see the revolutionary will and great strength of hundreds of millions of masses, and their minds are filled with "condition theory" and "habit theory", being infinitely pessimistic about the development of agricultural production. In the march towards nature, there is an irreconcilable struggle between two lines between us and them, and this struggle has been constantly going on. In 1957, we launched a major debate with them, the focus of which was: "Rely on heaven for food, or conquer nature?" "Crawl or leap forward?" "Has production reached its peak, or is the production potential infinite?" "Should we let disasters and difficulties overwhelm us, or should we overcome disasters and difficulties?" In the final analysis, it is a question of whether to be slaves of nature or masters of nature. We shattered all kinds of right-leaning conservative ideas and implemented the Party's General Line for socialist construction, thereby achieving continuous great leaps forward in agricultural production in 1958 and 1959. The continuous great leaps forward in the past two years have greatly eliminated superstition and liberated minds. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants has become greater and greater, and their confidence in overcoming nature has become more and more sufficient. This can be clearly seen from the rapid and great success of the current winter water conservancy construction movement throughout the province, which is unprecedented in scale. We fully believe that the broad masses of peasants will surely hold even higher the red flag of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and with even higher labor enthusiasm and even greater scale, launch a new upsurge in agricultural production and strive for the continued leap forward in agricultural production in 1960.

The transformation of relations of production and the liberation of people's minds have made it possible to universally implement advanced yield-increasing technologies and yield-increasing measures. Comrade Mao Zedong, in the high tide of cooperativization in 1955, foresaw that the high tide of agricultural cooperativization would inevitably bring about an unprecedented high tide of agricultural production, personally drafted the Forty Articles of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), and emphatically proposed twelve measures to increase the production of crops. After three years of practice, especially the rich practical experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the eight most basic factors for increasing crop production, "soil, fertilizer, water, seeds, density, protection, management, and work," which is the famous "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. As a result of our relying on the superiority of the people's communes and comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, we have realized the continuous leaps forward in agricultural production, the natural landscape has undergone tremendous changes, and farming technology has been raised to a new level. The "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture comprehensively reveals the objective laws of transforming nature and winning bumper harvests on the agricultural front, opening up infinitely broad horizons for the continuous leaps forward in agricultural production. With the growing consolidation and growth of the people's communes, with the gradual promotion of mechanization and electrification, the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture will increasingly demonstrate its great significance. Although the progress we have made in implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture is unprecedented, compared with the development prospects of agriculture, it is only the first step in a long march. Among the eight characters, each character has earth-shattering articles waiting for us to do. In fact, under the leadership of the Party, the masses of peasants are constantly enriching the specific content of the Eight-Character Charter for agriculture with newer creations and newer achievements.

The Great Leap Forward in agricultural production and the realization of the people's commune system have placed urgent demands on the implementation of technical transformation of agriculture and the gradual realization of mechanization and electrification of agriculture, and have also created the necessary conditions. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. Gradually realizing the mechanization and electrification of agriculture, developing agricultural production at high speed, and making the development of agricultural production adapt to the needs of the development of industry and other sectors of the national economy, thereby promoting their development, is a fundamental issue in the entire socialist construction. The Party's General Line for socialist construction, under the premise of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, implements the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture and a series of two-legged walking policies, which enables us to give full play to the strength of central industry and local industry, large-scale industry and small and medium-sized industry, state-owned industry and commune-run industry, and equip agriculture on a fully mobilized scale in terms of steel production, machinery, and electricity, and realize the mechanization and electrification of agriculture at high speed. This great revolution in agricultural technical transformation has already begun, and we will see it move forward with huge strides in the coming years. A new stage of agricultural mechanization and electrification has already unfolded before us. Under the illumination of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, our five thousand million industrious and brave peasants in Shandong will surely greatly promote the communist style, rely on the incomparable superiority of the people's communes, gradually master modern production tools and advanced science and technology, launch a full-scale revolution in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production and fishery, and make greater contributions to the magnificent cause of building our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science and culture.

Anyone who does not see the magnificent prospects of our cause, does not believe in the strength of the Party and the masses, will become a mediocre person who clings to the old and lacks vision, and will be incompatible with proletarian revolutionaries who have lofty communist ideals and the magnificent ambition to transform the world. When we are striving for a better and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960 with full confidence on the basis of the continuous great leaps forward in 1958 and 1959, they mistakenly believe that the revolution has reached the end, and the people's commune no longer needs to be further consolidated and improved; the measures have been implemented to the full, and there is nothing more to be done with the "Eight-Character Charter"; production has reached its peak, and output cannot continue to leap forward. As for launching a technical revolution on the agricultural front and realizing mechanization and electrification, in their view, it is even more of a distant empty talk. They become so-called "condition theorists" and "habit theorists", and are accustomed to using Marxist-Leninist words such as "starting from reality" and "listening to the opinions of the masses" to cover up their conservative ideas. They have no common language with us proletarian revolutionaries. We attach importance to conditions, but we attach more importance to changing old and unfavorable conditions and creating new and favorable conditions. We pay attention to habits, but we pay more attention to changing old and conservative habits and establishing new revolutionary habits. What we adhere to is the real "starting from reality", starting from revolutionary reality, starting from the high-speed development of the cause of socialist construction, starting from the interests of 600 million people, not clinging to the old and sticking to conventions. What we adhere to is the real "listening to the words of the masses", listening to the words of the broad masses of working peasants, mainly poor and lower-middle peasants, who demand rapid changes in the situation of poverty and blankness, not listening to the words of a very small number of well-to-do middle peasants who want to take the capitalist road.

The above facts show that class struggle has not been extinguished and will continue for a longer period in the ideological field. We must not only carry the socialist revolution through to the end on the economic front, but also carry the socialist revolution through to the end on the political and ideological front, and advance towards the great goal of communism. We must firmly grasp the great theoretical weapon of uninterrupted revolution, faithfully implement the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results to build socialism, and bravely advance to realize a better and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960.

    掌握不断革命的理论武器促使农业生产不断跃进
    中共山东省委第一书记　舒同
    以毛泽东同志为首的党中央所制定的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，是创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的普遍真理指导我国社会主义建设的具体实践的光辉范例，是马克思列宁主义在我国社会主义建设问题上一个划时代的新发展。这条路线深刻地体现了不断革命论的思想。我们必须掌握不断革命的理论武器，具有不断革命的精神，才能彻底地坚持党的社会主义建设总路线，促进社会主义建设事业高速度的发展。
    不断革命论是马克思列宁主义的一条基本理论。在马克思主义者看来，客观世界每时每刻都处在对立的统一和斗争的过程中，发展变化，永无止境。人类社会是如此，自然界也是如此。毛泽东同志教导我们：矛盾存在于一切事物的发展过程中，没有什么事物是不包含矛盾的，没有矛盾就没有世界，一切事物中包含的矛盾方面的相互依赖和相互斗争，决定一切事物的生命力，推动一切事物的发展。毛泽东同志用“新陈代谢”来形容事物的发展过程，向我们指出：“新陈代谢是宇宙间普遍的永远不可抵抗的规律”；“任何事物的内部都有其新旧两个方面的矛盾，形成为一系列的曲折的斗争。斗争的结果，新的方面由小变大，上升为支配的东西；旧的方面则由大变小，变成逐步归于灭亡的东西。”客观世界的全部发展过程，也就是毛泽东同志所指出的新陈代谢、除旧布新、推陈出新的过程，而这个过程，不论在人类社会，还是自然界，又都是经过曲折复杂的斗争而实现的。马克思列宁主义关于不断革命的原理的根据就在于此。否认不断革命论，企图阻止客观事物的发展过程，实际上就是背离了马克思列宁主义。
    当然，不断革命论与革命发展阶段论是辩证的统一的，因为客观世界的发展过程，是按照从量变到质变的规律进行的。当事物处在相对静止的量变过程的时候，看来似乎稳定在一个发展阶段上，其实却在那里积极为显著变动的质变过程作准备。当质变发生的时候，就跨过旧的阶段，而进入新的阶段，开始新的量变过程，并为新的质变作准备。人类社会的各个历史阶段都是如此，中国革命由民主革命阶段到社会主义革命与社会主义建设阶段的演变过程更是如此。革命事业的发展，就是循着这个规律，不断地从一个阶段走向另一个阶段。不承认事物发展由量变到质变的必然性，企图在革命发展的一定的阶段上停顿下来，不再前进，就必然要犯右的错误；同样，不承认事物发展的量变过程，否定革命发展的阶段性，就必然要犯“左”的错误。
    坚持不断革命论，正确掌握不断革命论与革命阶段论的辩证统一，对于贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，促进人民公社的成长和发展，促进农业生产的连续跃进，具有决定性的意义。当我们回顾山东农业生产的巨大成就和展望其光辉前景的时候，对于毛主席和党中央关于不断革命的教导，不仅感到分外的亲切，而且更加深刻地体会到这一理论对于指导我们的实践的伟大意义。
    解放以来，山东农业生产的发展过程，就是一个不断革命的过程，在粮食方面由过去的所谓“缺粮户”逐渐变为自给户，又由“自给户”向着自给有余和逐渐富裕的方向发展。很多地方由低产一跃而为高产，粉碎了过去那些定局论和宿命论的错误观点。1949年全省粮食产量为二百一十五亿斤，1956年增长至二百九十三亿斤，1958年空前大跃进，增至三百八十亿斤，1959年虽然遇到严重干旱，仍然实现了继续跃进，打破了历史上因灾减产的常规。我们农业生产大发展的过程，也就是农业生产关系大革命的过程，农业生产技术大革命的过程，人们不断解放思想、鼓足干劲的过程。
    适应生产力的发展，农村中生产关系的适时变革，是推进农业生产发展的巨大力量。在目前，特别是充分发挥人民公社一大二公的优越性，对促进农业生产的连续跃进，具有极其重大的意义。解放以来，我们完成土地改革的历史任务以后，并没有使革命停滞不前，而是遵照毛主席和党中央的指示，立即展开了对农业的社会主义改造。经过具有社会主义萌芽的互助组，半社会主义的初级合作社，完全社会主义的高级合作社等互相衔接的发展阶段，胜利地改造了劳动农民的个体所有制，实现了土地、牲畜、大农具等主要生产资料的社会主义集体所有制。生产关系的变革解放了生产力，给实行农业技术革命、采取先进增产措施创造了条件，因而有力地促进了农业生产的发展。特别是从1958年春天党提出社会主义建设的总路线以来，全面大跃进的形势和人民公社的建立，更给农业生产的发展和农业生产水平的提高，开辟了无限广阔的前途。农民群众在回忆对比时作了这样的描述：“互助组使的辘轳、步犁，每年增产百分之几；合作社置上解放式（水车）、双铧犁，每年增产三十、二十（斤），人民公社有了抽水机、拖拉机，每年增产论百（斤）论番。”农民根据亲身的经验懂得：要迅速改变“一穷二白”的落后面貌，唯一的道路，就是党所指出的社会主义的集体化和大生产的道路。特别是在公社化以后，由于工农商学兵相互结合，农林牧副渔全面发展，实行了工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，举办了各种集体福利事业，我们的农业生产就更能以空前的规模和速度向前跃进了。
    人民公社将是我国实现两个过渡，即由集体所有制过渡到全民所有制和由社会主义社会过渡到共产主义社会的最好形式，就是到将来的共产主义社会，人民公社也将是一种适当的基层社会组织形式。但这并不是说，人民公社的生产关系已经尽善尽美，可以停滞不前了。恰恰相反，当生产力发展到一定阶段的时候，又会和现有的人民公社的生产关系发生一定的矛盾。那时就要进一步地改进现有的生产关系，使其和生产力的发展相适应。在社会主义社会中，生产关系和生产力总是又相适应又相矛盾的，在生产发展的过程中必须不断解决矛盾，不断求得适应，也就是说，要不断革命。正如党的八届六中全会关于人民公社若干问题的决议中所指出的：“在由社会主义向共产主义过渡的问题上，我们不能在社会主义的阶段上停步不前，但是也不能陷入超越社会主义阶段而跳入共产主义阶段的空想。我们是马克思列宁主义的不断革命论者，我们认为，在民主革命和社会主义革命之间，在社会主义和共产主义之间，没有隔着也不允许隔着万里长城；我们又是马克思列宁主义的革命发展的阶段论者，我们认为不同的发展阶段反映事物的质的变化，不应当把这些不同质的阶段互相混淆起来。”
    我们必须正确认识不断革命论与革命发展阶段论辩证统一的关系。现在人民公社实行三级所有制，以生产队基本所有制为基础，将来还要从生产队基本所有制逐步过渡到公社基本所有制，从集体所有制逐步过渡到全民所有制，从社会主义的全民所有制逐步过渡到共产主义的全民所有制。这是人民公社发展的必然趋势。我们既要认识逐步过渡的重要意义，善于区别这些不同质的发展阶段，承认革命发展的阶段论；又要清楚地看到这种发展的必然趋势，首先为生产队基本所有制向公社基本所有制过渡创造条件，以便在条件成熟的时候，适时地顺利地完成这种过渡，以进一步解放生产力，促进生产的发展，并为逐步完成其他几个过渡创造条件。
    目前人民公社集体经营的事业和社办工业的发展；在工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度的执行中，集体福利事业的发展和按需分配萌芽的成长；以试验田为基地的大面积丰产方的推行；各种专业的生产队和全社性的常年性的水利建设队伍的建立；实行三圈到田，按方按片建立饲养基地，使畜牧生产和大规模的农业耕作结合起来；在全社范围内因地制宜建立各种生产基地和商品基地；国家从经济上支援穷队穷社赶上富队富社；这一切都在不断地扫除小生产的遗迹，有力地促进农业生产的连续跃进，同时也为逐步实现机械化的大生产和逐步促进人民公社的过渡创造着条件。
    农业生产发展的过程是人们同自然作斗争的过程。在这一斗争中，我们要相信群众能自己解放自己，由自然的奴隶变为自然的主人。自然的潜力是无穷的，人们发掘自然潜力的能力也是无穷的。我们要以不断革命的精神，充分发挥人的主观能动作用，认识自然，改造自然。在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，广大农民鼓足干劲，力争上游，以让高山低头、大河让路的革命英雄气概，打开了自然的宝藏，获得了农业生产的不断跃进。他们硬是把丘岭整成平地，硬是把沙荒变成良田，硬是把穷山恶水变成青山绿水，硬是把低产变成高产，硬是把奔腾咆哮的黄河这条蛟龙拦腰斩断，驱使它驯服地灌溉农田。农民群众在党的领导下所表现出来的这种征服自然的顽强的革命意志和创造革新的智慧，是我们充分发挥人民公社的优越性、推进农业技术革命、实现农业持续跃进的决定因素。所谓“意识形态产生物质”就是这个道理。
    右倾保守的人看不到千百万群众的革命意志和伟大力量，脑子里装满了什么“条件论”、“习惯论”，对于发展农业生产无限悲观。在向大自然进军当中，我们和他们之间存在着不可调和的两条路线的斗争，这种斗争一直在不断地进行着。1957年我们就曾和他们展开了一场重大的争论，争论的重点就是：“靠天吃饭，还是征服自然？”“爬行还是跃进？”“生产已经到顶还是生产潜力无穷？”“是让灾荒困难压倒我们，还是让我们战胜灾荒困难？”归根到底，就是究竟是做自然的奴隶，还是做自然的主人。我们粉碎了形形色色的右倾保守思想，贯彻执行了党的社会主义建设总路线，从而取得了1958年和1959年农业生产的连续大跃进。两年来的连续大跃进，大大地破除了迷信，解放了思想，广大农民群众的革命干劲愈来愈大，战胜自然的信心愈来愈足，这从目前冬季全省规模空前的水利建设运动迅速取得巨大成效可以看得清清楚楚。我们充分相信，广大农民必将更高地举起总路线、大跃进和人民公社的红旗，以更加高涨的劳动热情和更加巨大的规模，掀起农业生产的新高潮，争取1960年农业生产的继续跃进。
    生产关系的变革和人们思想的解放，使普遍实行先进的增产技术和增产措施成为可能。毛泽东同志在1955年的合作化高潮当中，预见到了农业合作化的高潮必然带来一个空前的农业生产高潮，亲自拟定了全国农业发展纲要（草案）四十条，强调地提出了十二项农作物的增产措施。经过三年的实践，特别是1958年的大跃进的丰富实践经验，毛泽东同志又从中概括出农作物增产的八个最基本的因素“土、肥、水、种、密、保、管、工”，这就是著名的农业“八字宪法”。我们依靠人民公社的优越性，全面执行农业“八字宪法”的结果，实现了农业生产的不断跃进，自然面貌发生了巨大的变化，耕作技术提高到一个新的水平。农业“八字宪法”概括地揭示了在农业战线上改造自然、夺取丰收的客观规律，给农业生产的不断跃进，开辟了无限广阔的天地。随着人民公社的日益巩固成长，随着机械化、电气化的逐步推行，农业“八字宪法”将日益显示出它的巨大意义。目前我们在执行农业“八字宪法”上所取得的进展，虽然是前所未有的，但和农业的发展前景相比，不过是万里长征第一步。八字之中，字字都有经天纬地的大文章，等待我们去做。事实上在党的领导之下，农民群众每时每刻都在以更新的创造，更新的成就，继续不断地丰富着农业八字宪法的具体内容。
    农业生产的大跃进和人民公社化的实现，对实行农业的技术改造，逐步实现农业的机械化、电气化，提出了迫切的要求，同时也创造了必要的条件。农业是国民经济的基础，逐步实现农业的机械化、电气化，高速度地发展农业生产，使农业生产的发展适应工业和国民经济其他部门发展的需要，从而促进它们的发展，这是整个社会主义建设中的一个根本性的问题。而党的社会主义建设的总路线，在优先发展重工业的前提下，实行工农业并举和一系列两条腿走路的方针，就使我们能够充分发挥中央工业和地方工业、大型工业和中小型工业、国营工业和社办工业的力量，在钢铁生产、机械、电力方面，以全面动员的规模来装备农业，高速度地实现农业的机械化、电气化。这一个农业技术改造的伟大革命已经开始了，我们在今后的几年中，将会看到它以巨大的步伐向前迈进。农业的机械化、电气化的新阶段，已经展现在我们面前了。在党的社会主义建设总路线的照耀之下，我们山东五千余万勤劳勇敢的农民群众，必将大大发扬共产主义风格，依靠人民公社的无比优越性，逐步掌握起现代化的生产工具和先进的科学技术，展开农林牧副渔全线大革命，在把我国建成一个现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大社会主义国家的壮丽事业中，做出更大的贡献。
    谁看不到我们事业的壮丽前景，不相信党和群众的力量，就会变成抱残守缺、鼠目寸光的庸人，而同具有共产主义远大理想和改造世界的雄伟气魄的无产阶级革命家，格格不入。当我们在1958年和1959年的连续大跃进的基础上满怀信心争取1960年更好更全面的跃进的时候，他们却错误地认为：革命已经到底了，人民公社不需再继续巩固提高了；措施已经到家了，“八字宪法”没有文章可做了；增产已经到顶了，产量不能继续跃进了。至于展开农业战线上的技术革命，实现机械化、电气化，在他们看来，更是遥不可期的空话。他们变成所谓“条件论”者、“习惯论”者，而且惯于假借“从实际出发”、“听群众意见”等马克思列宁主义词句，来掩护自己的保守思想。他们和我们无产阶级革命家没有共同语言。我们是重视条件的，但是我们更重视改变旧的不利的条件，创造新的有利的条件。我们是注意习惯的，但是我们更注意改变旧的保守的习惯，树立新的革命的习惯。我们所坚持的是真正的“从实际出发”，从革命的实际出发，从高速度发展社会主义建设事业出发，从六亿人民的利益出发，而不是抱残守缺，故步自封。我们所坚持的是真正的“听群众的话”，是听贫农下中农为主的广大劳动农民要求迅速改变一穷二白状况的话，而不是听极少数的想走资本主义道路的富裕中农的话。
    上述事实说明，阶级斗争并没有熄灭，而在思想领域内，将要持续一个更长的时期。我们不仅要在经济战线上把社会主义革命进行到底，而且必须在政治思想战线上把社会主义革命进行到底，向共产主义的伟大目标前进。我们要牢牢地掌握不断革命这个伟大的理论武器，忠实地贯彻执行党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，为实现1960年更好的全面的跃进而奋勇前进。
