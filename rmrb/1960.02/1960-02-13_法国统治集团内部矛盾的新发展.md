New Developments in the Internal Contradictions of the French Ruling Group
Zhang Fan

The current French political situation is turbulent. The shock caused by the dismissal of Finance Minister Pinay has not yet subsided, and new and more serious conflicts have erupted within the French ruling group. On January 24, extreme colonial elements launched an anti-De Gaulle armed riot in Algiers. In major cities such as Oran, Constantine, and Boni, extreme colonial elements also successively created "market strikes," "strikes," demonstrations, and even small-scale armed riots. The riots lasted for eight days before failing. This incident shows that the De Gaulle regime's colonial policy in Algeria has reached a dead end, and also fully exposes the internal instability of this regime. Now, the serious political crisis caused by the riot is continuing to develop, and the French reactionaries are using this turbulent situation to push France towards further fascism.

The Division of Two Major Groups Comes to the Surface

The Algiers riot was the result of a long-standing division between the financial colonial group in mainland France and the planter colonial group in Algeria.

These two groups are in complete agreement on maintaining colonial rule over Algeria, but there are serious differences in the methods and ways of achieving this goal. The planter colonial group was gradually formed after France began occupying Algeria in 1830. They have deep-rooted power and influence in the local area, and have long been dominant. They occupy a large amount of fertile land in Algeria, operate agriculture on a large scale, monopolize trade between France and Algeria, and also control local administrative and economic institutions. Their main interest lies in directly carrying out economic and extra-economic exploitation of the Algerian people in the old colonial way. Therefore, they advocate completely merging Algeria with France through military suppression, and oppose any adjustment to the old colonial system. Their slogan is: "Algeria is France." The financial colonial group in the mainland, especially the oil and mining monopoly groups, are eager to plunder Algeria's rich resources, especially the oil in the Sahara, on a large scale as soon as possible, in order to obtain huge profits and strengthen the economic strength and international competitive position of French monopoly capital. The protracted colonial war hinders their plan to plunder resources on a large scale. Therefore, in the situation where a military solution is hopeless, they are increasingly inclined to make certain concessions to the Algerian people and achieve a ceasefire that is beneficial to France, in order to achieve the goal of maintaining colonial rule over Algeria by means other than war. The industrial monopoly groups in the mainland (except for the arms industry groups that make a fortune through war) basically stand on the side of the financial colonial group, because the long-term delay of the war and the increasing military expenditure burden affect the sales market, investment ability, and competitive ability of the industrial sector.

Due to their different backers, the French bourgeois political parties are correspondingly divided into two factions on the Algerian issue. One faction, mainly composed of the "Union for the New Republic" Chaban-Delmas majority faction and the Independent Party Pinay-Reynaud faction, and supported by the Socialist Party, the Popular Republican Movement, and the Radical Socialist Party, is consistent with the demands of the financial colonial group and the industrial monopoly group in the mainland. The other faction, mainly composed of the "Union for the New Republic" Soustelle minority faction, the Independent Party Duchet faction, and Bidault's Christian Democratic Party, and supported by the Algerian parliamentary organization "Republican Unity," is an important pillar of the planter colonial group. They have formed the "French Algeria League." In addition, supporting the planter colonial group are dozens of extreme colonial element groups in Algeria, a part of the colonial army generals and officers, and professional soldiers with long-term colonial war experience centered on lower-ranking officers and non-commissioned officers. The so-called "National Movement Solidarity Committee," which came forward to lead the riot this time, is an extreme colonial element organization directly controlled by the planter colonial group, and has close ties with the "French Algeria League" and a part of the extreme colonial elements in the colonial army. This riot was actually a serious contest between the two major groups.

De Gaulle Can Hardly Play a Balancing Act

De Gaulle basically represents the interests of the financial colonial group in the mainland, but he came to power relying on the military riot instigated by the extreme colonial elements of the planter colonial group. Therefore, De Gaulle's Algerian policy on the one hand basically reflects the interests of the financial colonial group, and on the other hand, takes into account the emotions of the planter colonial group to a certain extent. De Gaulle's policy of both military suppression and political deception is a product of this situation. This policy is specifically embodied in De Gaulle's statement on the handling of the Algerian issue issued on September 16 last year. In this statement, De Gaulle, under the pressure of the domestic and international situation, has verbally abandoned the outdated formula of "Algeria is France," and for the first time formally recognized that the Algerian people enjoy the "right to self-determination." However, he attached various restrictions to this "right to self-determination," stipulating that a "referendum" would be held under the control of France within four years after "the actual restoration of peace," allowing the Algerian people to choose their future from the so-called three options of "separation," merger, and internal autonomy. Moreover, it is stipulated that under any circumstances, the oil rights of French colonists in the Sahara will be guaranteed. It can be seen that the conditions attached by De Gaulle can make the implementation of "self-determination" indefinitely postponed or turned into nothing. The "referendum" and "elections" held by De Gaulle in Algeria after he came to power have long proved that this kind of "self-determination" under bayonets and submachine guns is nothing but a scam.

This scam can basically adapt to the desire of the financial colonial group to seek ways other than war to continue to maintain control over Algeria, especially to occupy the oil-rich Sahara. But it aroused the unease and opposition of the planter colonial group, who demanded that De Gaulle abandon the so-called "self-determination" policy and replace it with the "merger" policy that they have always insisted on. As early as mid-October last year, when the French National Assembly discussed the Algerian issue, a public contest was held between the two major groups. At that time, nine Soustelle faction members withdrew from the "Union for the New Republic" parliamentary group, attempting to create division and create a chaotic situation. Extreme colonial elements attempted to create riots in Paris and Algeria to cooperate, in order to overthrow the Debré cabinet and force De Gaulle to listen to their plans. This contest ended in the failure of the planter colonial group. Subsequently, because De Gaulle and Debré repeatedly emphasized military suppression and rejected the Algerian Provisional Government's proposal to appoint Ben Bella and others to negotiate with the French government on the conditions and guarantees for the realization of "self-determination," this struggle was superficially eased. However, with the increasing bankruptcy of the military suppression policy, the contradictions between the two major groups continued to develop.

Although the Riot is Suppressed, the Contradictions are Not Resolved

Recently, extreme colonial elements intended to take advantage of the political turmoil caused by the Pinay incident and De Gaulle's difficult situation to put pressure on De Gaulle, demanding that De Gaulle continue to implement a "tough policy" on the Algerian issue. As a result, Massu, the leader of the Algiers military riot on May 13, 1958, came forward to publicly oppose De Gaulle's actions on the Algerian issue. However, De Gaulle dismissed Massu from his post as commander of the Algiers defense area and civil affairs chief. Extreme colonial elements launched a long-planned armed riot, demanding that De Gaulle completely listen to their demands, and to implement a more blatant fascist dictatorship in mainland France that would fully meet their will. In order to ease the contradictions, the French government did not take effective measures to quickly quell the riots, but simply appease the extreme colonial elements. However, the broad masses of the French people strongly opposed the riots. On February 1, French workers, teachers, and students victoriously held a one-hour general strike and strike to oppose the fascist riots. The rioters, because they were in an extremely isolated position politically, finally suffered a shameful defeat.

Now, although the Algiers riot has ended, the serious political difficulties suffered by the French ruling group have not been eliminated. De Gaulle vainly attempts to further strengthen his personal dictatorship in the name of "maintaining order and defending the country," attacking the little democratic rights remaining to the people, and attacking the people's movement in France that truly seeks a reasonable solution to the Algerian issue.

Under the manipulation of his regime, the National Assembly and the Senate respectively discussed and passed the bill to grant the government "special powers" for a period of one year on February 2 and 3. This bill allows the Debré government under De Gaulle's control to take relevant "necessary measures" by issuing orders and bypassing the parliament under the pretext of "pacifying and managing Algeria," which further leads the French political situation to fascism. However, the reactionary leaders of France cannot get rid of the various difficulties caused by their reactionary policies, and will only accelerate the collapse of the personal dictatorship regime.

    法国统治集团内部矛盾的新发展
    张帆
    当前法国政局动荡不已。财政部长比内免职事件所引起的震荡尚未平息，法国统治集团内部又爆发了新的更加严重的冲突。1月24日极端殖民分子在阿尔及尔发动了反戴高乐的武装暴乱。在奥兰、君士坦丁、波尼等重要城市，极端殖民分子也相继制造了“罢市”、“罢工”、示威乃至小规模的武装骚乱。暴乱持续了八天，才归于失败。这一事件表明了戴高乐政权在阿尔及利亚的殖民政策已经到了山穷水尽的地步，也充分暴露了这个政权的内部不稳。现在，暴乱事件所造成的严重政治危机还在继续发展，法国反动当局正利用这种动荡局面把法国推向进一步法西斯化的道路。
    两大集团的分歧表面化
    阿尔及尔暴乱事件是法国本土的金融殖民集团和阿尔及利亚境内的庄园主殖民集团之间由来已久的分歧表面化的结果。
    这两个集团在保持对阿尔及利亚的殖民统治这一点上是完全一致的，但在如何达到这一目的的方式、方法上存在着严重的分歧。庄园主殖民集团是1830年法国开始占领阿尔及利亚后逐渐形成的，他们在当地有着根深蒂固的势力和影响，实际上老早已经独霸一方了。他们在阿尔及利亚占有大量肥沃的土地，大规模经营农业，垄断了法国和阿尔及利亚之间的贸易，而且还把持着当地的行政机关和经济机构。他们的主要利益在于以旧的殖民方式对阿尔及利亚人民直接进行经济和超经济的剥削。因此，他们力主通过武力镇压把阿尔及利亚同法国完全合并，反对对旧有的殖民制度作任何调整。他们的口号是：“阿尔及利亚就是法国”。本土的金融殖民集团，特别是石油和矿业垄断集团，很想早日大规模掠夺阿尔及利亚丰富的资源，首先是撒哈拉的石油，以便获取巨额利润，并且加强法国垄断资本的经济实力和国际竞争地位。殖民战争旷日持久妨碍了他们大规模掠夺资源的计划，因此，在军事解决无望的形势下，他们日益倾向于对阿尔及利亚人民作某些让步，实现对法国有利的停火，以便用战争以外的办法达到保持对阿尔及利亚的殖民统治的目的。本土的工业垄断集团（除了靠战争发财的军火工业集团）基本上是站在金融殖民集团方面的，因为战争长期拖延，军费负担日增，影响到工业部门的销售市场、投资能力和竞争能力。
    法国各资产阶级政党由于他们的后台不同，在阿尔及利亚问题上相应地分裂为两派。以“保卫新共和联盟”夏朗东多数派和独立党比内—雷诺派为主并得到社会党、人民共和党、激进社会党支持的一派，同本土的金融殖民集团和工业垄断集团的主张是一致的；以
  “保卫新共和联盟”苏斯戴尔少数派、独立党杜协派和皮杜尔的天主教民主党为主并得到阿尔及利亚议员组织“共和国统一”支持的一派，则是庄园主殖民集团的重要支柱，他们已经组成了“法属阿尔及利亚联盟”。此外，支持庄园主殖民集团的还有阿尔及利亚境内的几十个极端殖民分子团体，殖民军队中的一部分将领和军官以及以下级军官和士官为核心的、具有长期的殖民战争经历的职业军人。这次出面领导暴乱的所谓“民族运动团结委员会”就是受庄园主殖民集团直接控制的极端殖民分子组织，而且是同“法属阿尔及利亚联盟”和一部分殖民军队中的极端殖民分子有密切的联系。这次暴乱实际上是两大集团之间的一次严重较量。
    戴高乐难以左右逢源
    戴高乐基本上是代表本土的金融殖民集团利益的，但他又是依靠庄园主殖民集团的极端殖民分子所策动的军事暴乱上台的。因此，戴高乐的阿尔及利亚政策一方面基本上反映着金融殖民集团的利益，另方面又在一定程度上照顾到庄园主殖民集团的情绪。戴高乐的军事镇压和政治欺骗双管齐下的方针，正是这种情势的产物。这个方针具体体现在去年9月16日戴高乐发表的关于处理阿尔及利亚问题的声明里面。这个声明，戴高乐迫于国内外形势，已在字面上抛弃“阿尔及利亚就是法国”这一陈腐的公式，第一次正式承认阿尔及利亚人民享有“自决权”。但是他又对这种“自决权”附加了种种限制，规定在“实际恢复和平”以后四年内在法国一手包办下举行“公民投票”，让阿尔及利亚人民在所谓“分离”、合并和内政自治三种方案中选择自己的前途，而且规定，无论在那种情况下，法国殖民者在撒哈拉的石油权益都将得到保证。由此可见，戴高乐所附加的条件可以使“自决权”的实施遥遥无期或者化为乌有。戴高乐上台后在阿尔及利亚举行的“公民投票”和“选举”，早已证明这种在刺刀和冲锋枪下的“自决”不过是一种骗局。
    这种骗局基本上能够适应金融殖民集团企图寻求战争以外的办法继续保持对阿尔及利亚的控制、特别是占有撒哈拉石油富源的愿望。但却引起了庄园主殖民集团的不安和反对，他们要求戴高乐放弃所谓“自决”政策，而代之以他们一向坚持的“合并”政策。还在去年10月中旬在法国国民议会讨论阿尔及利亚问题时，两大集团之间就进行了一次公开的较量。当时九名苏斯戴尔派议员退出“保卫新共和联盟”议会党团，企图制造分裂，造成混乱局面，极端殖民分子企图在巴黎和阿尔及利亚制造骚乱来进行配合，以便推翻德勃雷内阁，迫使戴高乐听从他们的计划。这次较量以庄园主殖民集团的失败而告终。随后，由于戴高乐和德勃雷一再强调军事镇压，拒绝阿尔及利亚临时政府提出的关于指派本·贝拉等同法国政府谈判实现“自决”的条件和保证的建议，才使这场斗争表面上趋于缓和。但随着军事镇压政策的日益破产，两大集团之间的矛盾却在继续发展。
    暴乱虽平息矛盾未解决
    最近，极端殖民分子本打算利用比内事件所引起的政局动荡和戴高乐处境困难的时机，对戴高乐施加压力，要求戴高乐在阿尔及利亚问题上继续执行“强硬政策”。于是，由1958年5月13日阿尔及尔军事暴乱的头子马絮出面，公开反对戴高乐在阿尔及利亚问题上的作法。但是，戴高乐却把马絮的阿尔及尔城防司令兼民政长官的职务解除了。极端殖民分子就发动了策划已久的武装暴乱，要戴高乐完全听从他们的主张，而且要在法国本土推行完全符合他们意志的更加露骨的法西斯专政。法国政府为了缓和矛盾，并没有采取有效措施迅速平息暴乱，而是一味安抚极端殖民分子。但是法国广大人民强烈反对暴乱。2月1日，法国全国职工、教员和学生胜利举行了一小时的总罢工和罢课，反对法西斯暴乱。暴乱分子因为在政治上陷于极端孤立的地位，终于遭到了可耻的失败。
    现在，阿尔及尔的暴乱虽已收场，但法国统治集团所遭受的严重的政治困难并没有消除。戴高乐妄图借“维持秩序保卫国家”为名，进一步加强个人独裁，向人民残存的一点民主权利进攻，向法国国内真正谋求合理解决阿尔及利亚问题的人民运动进攻。
    在他的政权操纵下，国民议会和参议院已分别于2月2日和3日讨论并通过了授予政府为期一年的“特别权力”法案。这个法案使得在戴高乐控制下的德勃雷政府能够在对“阿尔及利亚进行绥靖和管理”的借口下，用颁布命令的方式越过议会采取有关的“必要措施”，这就进一步将法国政局引向法西斯化。但是，法国的反动头目并不能摆脱他们的反动政策所造成的种种困难，只会加速个人独裁政权的崩溃过程。
