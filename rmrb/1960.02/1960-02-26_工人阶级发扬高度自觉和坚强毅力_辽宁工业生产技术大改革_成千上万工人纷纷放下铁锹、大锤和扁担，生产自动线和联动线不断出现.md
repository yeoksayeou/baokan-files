Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 24th: A tremendous revolution in production equipment and methods is underway on Liaoning's industrial front. Places with a high proportion of manual labor and heavy physical work are undergoing large-scale mechanization and semi-mechanization; places that are already mechanized are actively pursuing automation and semi-automation. Since the beginning of this year, from the steel capital to the coal capital, from the Bohai Bay to the Liaohe Plain, tens of thousands of workers have laid down shovels, sledgehammers, and carrying poles, freeing themselves from manual labor. Simultaneously, 836 automatic and interconnected production lines, 921 machine tools achieving single-machine automation, and four automated workshops have emerged.

The rapid development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement has promoted an all-around leap forward in production and is transforming the face of Liaoning Province's industrial enterprises with each passing day. This movement began first with mining, transportation, forging, and other types of work involving manual labor and heavy physical exertion, and is rapidly developing in all trades and industries and all auxiliary departments. Many factories did not ask the state for investment, equipment, or materials, but followed the path of self-reliance, making do with whatever was available, and combining indigenous and foreign methods, as pointed out by the Party, proceeding from their own conditions and needs, and engaging in large-scale communist collaboration. With redoubled enthusiasm, they are vigorously pursuing mechanization and semi-mechanization, transforming equipment, reforming technology, adjusting labor organization, and strengthening enterprise management, thereby greatly increasing labor productivity. Many factories have achieved increased production without increasing manpower, with one person doing the work of two; some old factories have even managed to increase production while saving manpower. The six design institutes in Shenyang City, due to carrying out major technical innovations, had respectively completed a year's worth of design work by February 19th, ahead of schedule. Yingkou City has completed its February production plan eleven days ahead of schedule, with daily production levels more than doubling compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Just a month ago, the workers at the Haicheng County Hardware Cooperative Factory were still laboring with hammers and chisels; recently, they fought for ten days, raising the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization from about 10% to 80%, rapidly increasing the factory's production efficiency by one to nine times.

The working class's high revolutionary consciousness and strong perseverance have broken through all kinds of ideological constraints, enabling the technical innovation movement of entire enterprises and entire industries to develop at high speed. Since the Fuxin Coal Mine workers created the coal loading machine, it took less than ten days for all coal mines in the province to realize mechanized coal loading. After the Shenyang Shanhe Shirt Factory successfully improved the sewing machine, the city's garment industry worked hard for twelve days, quickly converting more than 1,500 foot-operated sewing machines in 345 factories (cooperatives) into electric ones.

Under this situation, various localities are constantly creating new organizational leadership forms. Shenyang City's approach of "combining strips and blocks, braiding braids" has been very effective. The specific approach is: on the one hand, more than 1,000 industrial enterprises above the district level, six design institutes, seventeen universities and colleges, and five research institutions are organized into nine "braids" according to products: machinery, electrical, metallurgy, light industry, chemical industry, and handicrafts; on the other hand, collaboration is organized according to regions, such as the Heping District organizing a technical collaboration station and establishing organizations such as a technical advisory group with 926 worker participants, a design institute, an amateur processing plant, an innovation advanced service team, and a youth shock team. This method of "combining strips and blocks, braiding braids" organizational collaboration can achieve big helping small, strong helping weak, and if one family has difficulties, everyone helps together, promoting the continuous advancement of the movement. For example, the wood factory researched the electric planer for six months without success, so the advisory group helped design it, the spring factory took the initiative to support parts, and the motorcycle factory helped with processing, and the electric planer was successfully manufactured in two days. The collaboration between various enterprises and scientific research institutions and universities and colleges has also greatly developed during this period.

    工人阶级发扬高度自觉和坚强毅力
    辽宁工业生产技术大改革
    成千上万工人纷纷放下铁锹、大锤和扁担，生产自动线和联动线不断出现
    新华社沈阳24日电　辽宁工业战线上正在进行一场惊天动地的生产设备和生产方法的大改革。占用劳动力很多的手工操作和笨重体力劳动的地方，正在大搞机械化和半机械化；已经机械化的地方，正在积极实现自动化、半自动化。今年以来，从钢都到煤都，从渤海湾到辽河平原，已经有成千上万的工人纷纷放下铁锹、大锤和扁担，从手工操作中摆脱了出来。同时，还出现了八百三十六条自动生产线和联动生产线、九百二十一台实现单机自动化的机床和四个自动化车间。
    技术革新和技术革命运动的迅速发展，推动了生产的全面跃进，并且正在日新月异地改变着辽宁省工业企业的面貌。这次运动首先从手工操作和笨重体力劳动比重大的采矿、搬运、铸锻等工种开始，迅速发展到各行各业和一切辅助部门。许多工厂没有向国家要投资，要设备和材料，遵循着党所指出的自力更生，因陋就简，土洋结合的道路，从自己的条件和需要出发，大搞共产主义协作。他们热情百倍地大搞机械化和半机械化，改造设备，改革工艺，调整劳动组织和加强企业管理，从而大大提高了劳动生产率。许多工厂实现了增产不增人，一人抵两人；有的老厂还做到既增产又节约人力。沈阳市六个设计院由于开展技术大革新，到2月19日止就分别提前完成了一年的设计工作量。营口市已经提前十一天完成了2月份的生产计划，日产水平比去年第四季度提高一倍以上。一个月之前，海城县五金合作工厂的工人还是一锤一鎯头地进行劳动；最近，他们奋战十天，一举将机械化和半机械化程度由原来的10％左右提高到80％，使全厂生产效率迅速提高了一倍到九倍。
    工人阶级高度的革命自觉和坚强的毅力，冲破了种种思想束缚，使整个企业、整个行业的技术革新运动高速度地向前发展。自从阜新煤矿工人创造成攉煤机之后，不到十天的时间，全省煤矿就实现了攉煤机械化。沈阳市山河衬衣厂改进缝纫机成功以后，全市被服业大干十二天，三百四十五个厂（社）的一千五百多台缝纫机很快都由脚蹬变为电动。
    在这种形势下，各地不断创造出新的组织领导形式。沈阳市采取“条块结合、编辫子”的办法，效果很好。具体做法是：一方面把一千多个区以上的工业企业、六个设计院、十七所大专学校和五个研究机关，按产品编成机械、电气、冶金、轻工、化工、手工等九条辫子；一方面按照地区组织协作，如和平区组织了技术协作站，成立了有九百二十六名工人参加的技术顾问团、设计院、业余加工厂、革新先进服务队、青年突击队等组织。这种“条块结合、编辫子”组织协作的办法，可以做到大帮小、强帮弱，一家有困难，大家齐帮助，推动运动不断前进。如木制厂研究电刨子六个月没有成功，顾问团就帮助设计，弹簧厂主动支援零件，摩托车厂帮助加工，两天就把电刨制造成功了。各企业与科学研究机关、大专学校的协作，在这个期间也有很大发展。
