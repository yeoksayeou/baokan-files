    Cut-out Animation in Art Films
    Zhang Ding
    The General Line and the Great Leap Forward have brought about countless unprecedented miracles in all fronts of our motherland. On the cultural front, superstitions have been broken, and a bold and daring communist style has been established. The creation of cut-out animation by the Shanghai Art Film Studio is precisely a product of the Great Leap Forward. This achievement not only adds a new genre to our country's young film industry but even adds a new page to the history of world cinema. Cut-out animation reduces the film production process of art films, shortens production time, and lowers costs. But more importantly, it makes the national style of art film art more distinct.
    The American animated films we saw in our childhood, such as those Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck cartoons, were nonsensical and so-called humorous. Although technically mature, most of these animated films promoted reactionary bourgeois ideas, like most other American films, and had a very harmful effect on children.
    After liberation, we were able to see animated films from the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, which were both educational and artistic, and had their own national characteristics in terms of plot, expression methods, and artistic style.
    In artistic creation, foreign art can only be used for reference and cannot be a substitute. Art film was originally a foreign art, a new art form. How to nationalize it is indeed a difficult problem. And cut-out animation has made great achievements in the exploration of national style.
    Our ancestors created the shadow puppet art as early as the eleventh century. From the perspective of modeling art alone, it successfully absorbed the essence of classical Chinese patterns and folk patterns, and has a unique decorative style. It is a highly accomplished plane carving artwork. Chinese folk paper-cutting, which is similar to shadow puppetry, is even more widely spread in the vast rural areas of all provinces of the country. Since the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, a lot of work has been done in collecting, sorting and introducing it, and paper-cutting art has been familiar to people at home and abroad.
    Cut-out animation should draw a lot from folk shadow puppets and paper-cutting. What exactly should we draw from? How to draw from it? I would like to put forward some views for the reference of comrades engaged in art film art:
    Shadow puppets and paper-cutting are limited by plane modeling, but this is also the reason for its characteristics, giving full play to the maximum expressive power, and achieving harmony with life; the usual technique is to adopt a side view, on this basis, according to the various characteristics of the characters and social status, etc., to stylize and carry out strong exaggeration. However, our cut-out animation not only draws on but also greatly develops the characteristics of Chinese shadow puppets and paper-cutting, and unifies the scenery processing into the paper-cut pattern style.
    Secondly, shadow puppets and paper-cutting, in order to adapt to the light transmission effect, fully develop the carving skills, and the structure of the plane space achieves amazing beauty. In Chinese calligraphy, it is said that "count the white as black". Shadow puppet art must achieve both virtual and real to achieve a delicate artistic effect. Because of the carving technique, the inner and outer contours are sharp and pointed, which strengthens the accuracy, clarity, and vividness of the image. Some of the images in "The Fisherman Boy" have captured this characteristic very well.
    Chinese shadow puppets and Chinese colored paper-cuts (such as New Year window decorations in Inner Mongolia and Chengde), according to different objects, successfully use bright contrasting colors, and the colors are bright, which is the same as the costumes of traditional Chinese opera and folk New Year paintings, and pays great attention to the changes and unity of tones. For example, the images of the White Snake and the Green Snake in shadow puppet shows in various places, although partly imitating the costumes on the stage, still have their strict and unified tone in clothing. The color processing of other civil and military officials is also the same. In addition, the decorative nature of the colors is not restricted by natural colors, and it is more effective to express the ideal world and mythological themes. Therefore, new cut-out animation can also learn a lot from our traditional art in terms of color.
    The success of shooting cut-out animation is a glorious beginning in the development of China's art film industry. If we further study the traditional shadow puppets and paper-cutting in depth, we will surely have more gains in artistic creation.

    美术电影中的剪纸片
    张仃
    总路线、大跃进，使我们祖国在各个战线上都出现了数不清的史无前例的奇迹。在文化战线上，也破除了迷信，树立了敢想敢干的共产主义风格。上海美术电影制片厂剪纸片的创造，正是大跃进的产物。这一成就，不仅为我国年青的电影事业增加了一个新的片种，甚至为世界的电影史上也增添了新的一页。剪纸片减少了美术片的摄制工序，缩短了制片时间，减低了成本，但是更加重要的是：使美术电影艺术的民族风格更加鲜明。
    在我们幼年时代所看到的美国动画片，就是那些米老鼠、唐老鸭等等无理取闹的所谓滑稽卡通。那些动画片，在技术上是比较成熟了，但从思想方面来说，多数片子宣传的是反动的资产阶级思想，也像其他绝大多数的美国片一样，对儿童有极大的毒害作用。
    解放以后，我们才看到了苏联等兄弟国家的动画片，既有教育意义，又有艺术性，在故事情节、表现方法、艺术风格上都具有他们各自的民族特点。
    在艺术创造上，外国的艺术，只能借鉴，不能代替。美术电影原本是外来的艺术，是新的艺术品种。它如何民族化，确实是个难题。而剪纸片，在民族风格的探求上，已取得很大的成绩。
    我们祖先，早在十一世纪左右，就创造了皮影艺术。单从造型艺术角度来看，它成功地汲取了我国古典图案与民间图案中的精华，独具装饰风格，是造诣极高的平面雕镂艺术品。和皮影相近的中国民间剪纸，更加普遍地流传于全国各省的广大农村。自延安文艺座谈会以后，搜集、整理和介绍工作进行了不少，剪纸艺术已为国内外人士所熟悉。
    剪纸片应该向民间皮影、剪纸汲取的东西很多。究竟汲取什么？怎样汲取？提出一些看法，供从事美术电影艺术的同志们参考：
    皮影与剪纸，受平面造型所限制，但也因此而形成了它的特点，发挥了最大限度的表现力，并达到与生活上的和谐；通常的手法是采用侧面形式，在这个基础上，根据各种人物的性格与社会身份等诸特征加以程式化，进行强烈的夸张。但我们的剪纸片，不仅是汲取而且大大发挥了中国皮影与剪纸的特长，并在景物处理方面也都统一于剪纸图案风格之中。
    其次，皮影与剪纸，为适应光线透射效果，充分发展了雕镂技巧，平面空间的结构，达到惊人的美丽。中国书法中所谓：“计白当黑”，皮影艺术就要作到虚实兼顾，才能达到剔透玲珑的艺术效果，正因为采用雕镂手法，所以内外轮廓，锋利尖锐，更加强了形象的准确性、鲜明性与生动性。“渔童”中的形象有些地方就很好地抓住了这一特点。
    中国皮影和中国彩色剪纸（如内蒙古与承德一带的新年窗花），根据不同对象，成功地运用了鲜明的对比色，色彩响亮，与中国传统戏曲的服饰和民间年画等同具一格，并十分讲求色调的变化与统一，如各地皮影戏中白蛇青蛇的形象，虽然部分模仿舞台上的装扮，但在服装上，仍有其严格统一的调子，其它文臣武将等的色彩处理上，也莫不如此。此外，在色彩的装饰性上，不受自然色彩束缚，表现理想世界和神话题材，更加特具效果。所以新的剪纸片，在色彩方面，从我国传统艺术中足以借鉴的地方也很多。
    拍摄剪纸片的成功，在我国美术电影事业发展的过程中，是个光辉的开端，如果进一步向传统的皮影、剪纸深入地学习，在艺术创造上一定会有更多的收获。
