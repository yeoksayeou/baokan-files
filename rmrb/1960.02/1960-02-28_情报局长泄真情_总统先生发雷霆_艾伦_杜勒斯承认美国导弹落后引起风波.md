Xinhua News Agency, February 24th, Washington Dispatch: Recently, the American "Washington Post" published an article by Drew Pearson, reporting that U.S. intelligence chief Allen Dulles admitted during secret testimony before the U.S. Senate that the Soviet Union's missile power far exceeded that of the United States, causing U.S. President Eisenhower to become enraged and throw a tantrum, making a sorry spectacle.

Pearson said that CIA Director Allen Dulles provided "bleak intelligence" and "chilling figures" regarding the Soviet-American missile gap in secret testimony before the U.S. Congress on January 18th. He wrote: "President Eisenhower, after hearing about this, immediately asked for Dulles's testimony to be sent to him. After reading it, he immediately flew into a rage. According to people close to him, his reaction was the biggest explosion since the suspension of nuclear testing. If Dulles were not the brother of the late Secretary of State and had not served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, he might have been fired long ago."

Pearson pointed out that Eisenhower was so angry because the "bleak intelligence figures" provided by Dulles "not only thoroughly refuted (U.S. Defense Secretary) Gates but also refuted Ike's own optimistic assurances to the public."

Allen Dulles's testimony caused great shock in the U.S. Congress and the bourgeois press. According to U.S. news agencies, many members of Congress were very discouraged after hearing it. For example, Senator Yarborough said: "We are woefully behind. We are terribly behind."

    情报局长泄真情  总统先生发雷霆
    艾伦·杜勒斯承认美国导弹落后引起风波
    新华社24日讯　华盛顿消息：不久前美国“华盛顿邮报”刊载了德鲁·皮尔逊的一篇文章，报道美国特务头子艾伦·杜勒斯在美国参议院秘密作证时承认苏联导弹力量远远超过美国，使得美国总统艾森豪威尔恼羞成怒，大发雷霆的狼狈相。
    皮尔逊说，美国中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯1月18日在美国国会秘密作证中提供了苏美导弹差距的“凄凉的情报”和“令人寒心的数字”。他写道：“艾森豪威尔总统在听到这件事情后，立刻要人把杜勒斯的证词送给他看。他一读之下，马上怒火上升。据接近他的人描写，他当时的反应是暂停核试验以来最大的一次爆炸。要不是杜勒斯是已故国务卿的弟弟，并且在民主党及共和党政府里都担任过工作，他可能早就被解职了。”
    皮尔逊指出，艾森豪威尔所以这样恼火是因为杜勒斯提供的“凄凉的情报数字不但彻底批驳了（美国国防部长）盖茨，而且还批驳了艾克自己一向向公众提出的乐观的保证。”
    艾伦·杜勒斯的这篇证词曾使得美国国会和资产阶级报刊大为震动。据美国通讯社报道，当时许多国会议员听了以后十分沮丧。例如参议员亚布罗就说：“我们是可悲地落后了。我们是可怕地落后了。”
