Spring Colors in the Workshop
Beijing People's Printing Factory, Yang Junxian

　　Walking into the workshop, it's all spring in the workshop, colorful good news spreads quickly, golden light shines everywhere! The cutting machines sing heartily, the winding machines spin rapidly, the red flowers of the technological revolution bloom everywhere, and the abundant fruits are so plentiful! The competition between rivals is fiercely hot, learning from each other and catching up to achieve high quality and high output; the red flag inspires the young men's enthusiasm, and the spring breeze caresses the girls' smiling faces. Outside the window is the freezing winter, but inside the workshop, it is a spring garden in full bloom! Good news, poems, red flowers, and abundant fruits, decorate the workshop so beautifully!

    车间春色
    北京人民印刷厂　杨俊贤走进车间看，春色满车间，五彩纷飞捷报传，四处金光闪！铡边机尽情歌唱，卷绕机飞速旋转，技术革命的红花朵朵，累累的果实多么丰满！对手竞赛热浪滔天，你学我赶优质高产；红旗鼓舞着小伙子的干劲，春风吹拂着姑娘们的笑脸。窗外是零下冰雪的寒冬，车间里是花开满园的春天！捷报，诗篇，红花，硕果，把车间打扮得多么美丽！
