Xinhua News Agency, Paris, February 3rd: The riot of the extreme colonialists in Algiers was declared a failure after lasting for eight days. The strong condemnation of the riot by the vast majority of the French people politically isolated the rioters and put great pressure on the French government, which had been hesitant in its response to the riot. This was the decisive factor in the riot's failure. On February 1st, French workers, teachers, and students victoriously held a one-hour general strike and class boycott, demanding the suppression of the riot and warning that if the threat of fascist rioters increased, they would carry out larger and longer strikes and class boycotts.

In Algeria, the rioters had called on the citizens of Algiers to strike from February 1st to support them, but this call was not only unsupported by the Muslim residents but also by the majority of European residents. "France-Soir" said, "Nine out of ten Europeans have refused to support the riot."

In this situation, these extreme colonialists, seeing that the riot could not be sustained for long, began to negotiate with the French military authorities on the conditions for ending the riot. According to reports, the French military authorities agreed to allow the rebels either to disarm or to go to the Constantine region with their weapons to fight the Algerian National Liberation Army. Thus, at noon on February 1st, these rebels came out of the barricades they had been holding.

One of the main rebel leaders, Ortiz, has fled, and another rebel leader, Lagaillarde, has been captured by the French military.

Some political commentators believe that although the riot in Algiers has ended, the serious political difficulties currently faced by the French ruling group have not been eliminated. The riot of the extreme colonialists exposed the contradictions within the French ruling group on the Algerian issue. At the same time, French President De Gaulle is planning to use the Algiers riot to strengthen his personal power.

At the cabinet meeting held on February 1st, chaired by De Gaulle, the Algiers incident was discussed. Prime Minister Debré submitted to the cabinet a bill requesting the parliament to grant the government "special powers" for the period up to April 1, 1961. This bill would enable the Debré government, under De Gaulle's control, to take relevant "necessary measures" by issuing decrees, bypassing the parliament, under the pretext of "maintaining order, defending the country, and carrying out pacification and administration in Algeria" in accordance with Article 38 of the De Gaulle Constitution. This bill will further strengthen De Gaulle's personal dictatorship.

On the 2nd, at the request of the government, the National Assembly, which was in recess, held a special session to discuss the government's bill requesting the granting of "special powers." The right-wing majority, which controls the National Assembly, passed the government's bill, and the French Communist Party voted against it. The government has submitted this bill to the Senate for discussion.

    在法国人民的强大压力下
    阿尔及尔暴乱宣告失败
    法议会通过授予戴高乐“特别权力”的法案
    据新华社巴黎3日电  阿尔及尔极端殖民主义分子的暴乱在持续了八天之后宣告失败。法国绝大多数人民对暴乱的强烈谴责使暴乱分子在政治上陷于极端孤立，并且使对暴乱采取犹豫态度的法国政府受到极大压力。这是促使暴乱失败的决定性因素。2月1日，法国全国职工、教员和学生胜利举行了一小时的总罢工和罢课，要求镇压暴乱，并且警告，如果法西斯暴乱分子的威胁增大，将要进行规模更大和时间更长的罢工、罢课。
    在阿尔及利亚，暴乱分子曾号召阿尔及尔市民从2月1日起罢工来支持他们，但是，这一号召不仅没有得到穆斯林居民的支持，而且也没有得到大多数欧洲居民的支持。“法兰西晚报”说，“十分之九的欧洲人都拒绝支持暴乱。”
    在这样的形势下，这些极端殖民主义分子看到暴乱无法长久坚持下去，就开始同法军当局谈判结束暴乱的条件。据报道，法军当局同意让叛乱者或者解除武装，或者带着武器到君士坦丁地区去同阿尔及利亚民族解放军作战。于是，在2月1日中午，这些叛乱者就从他们据守的街垒中走了出来。
    主要的叛乱头子之一奥尔蒂斯已经逃跑了，另一个叛乱头子勒加亚德已经被法军捉住。
    一些政治评论员认为，阿尔及尔的暴乱虽然结束，但是目前法国统治集团遭受的严重的政治困难并没有消除。极端殖民主义者的暴乱暴露了法国统治集团内部在阿尔及利亚问题上的矛盾。同时，法国总统戴高乐正打算利用阿尔及尔暴乱事件来加强他的个人权力。
    在1日举行的由戴高乐主持的内阁会议上，讨论了阿尔及尔事件问题。总理德勃雷向内阁提出了要求议会在到1961年4月1日为止的时期内授予政府“特别权力”的法案，这个法案使在戴高乐控制下的德勃雷政府，能够在“维持秩序、保卫国家和在阿尔及利亚进行绥靖和施政”的借口下，有权根据戴高乐宪法第三十八条，用颁布命令的方式越过议会采取有关的“必要措施”，这个法案将进一步加强戴高乐的个人专权。
    2日，在政府要求下，正在休会的国民议会举行特别会议，讨论政府的要求授予“特别权力”的法案。控制着国民议会的右翼多数通过了政府的法案，法国共产党投票反对这个法案。政府已经把这个法案提交参议院讨论。
