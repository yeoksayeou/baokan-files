Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd. The national native produce procurement work achieved excellent results right from the start of this year. According to recent statistics from the Ministry of Commerce, the total national native produce procurement volume in January reached over 700 million yuan, completing 61.4% of the first quarter plan, equivalent to 70% of the total procurement volume in the first half of last year. Provinces such as Guizhou, Hunan, and Fujian have overfulfilled the first quarter's procurement plan ahead of schedule by two months. The procurement situation for various major varieties is also very good. For example, as of early February, the procurement volume of palm fiber reached 69.7% of the first quarter plan, rosin completed 58.7%, and turpentine completed 59%.

The local native produce procurement departments are all actively participating in production, helping people's communes formulate diversified business plans, and establish native product production bases. At the same time, based on last year's "Small Autumn Harvest" movement, they are assisting relevant departments in carrying out mass native produce processing movements, mainly to support commune-run industries. For example, in Baojing County, Hunan, the masses were mobilized to engage in the comprehensive utilization of processing jute bags, alcohol, pulp, tannin extract, and essential oils. By the end of January, 1,227 various processing plants had been established, an increase of 851 compared to the end of last year. The daily output of jute bags woven from wild fibers alone increased from 63 to 600.

Currently, local native produce procurement departments are carrying out technical innovations in native produce processing, promoting advanced processing machinery and experience to further increase the output and quality of native products. The Wuxian Commercial Bureau in Jiangsu Province created a iron-wood weaving reed mat machine, which increased efficiency tenfold compared to the original wooden machine. Hebei Province has initially created reed cutting, reed splitting, and reed mat weaving machines, creating conditions for realizing the mechanization of reed mat production, and is now continuing to improve and promote them. In addition, the shoulder pole machine and handle machine in Benxi, Liaoning, the grass bag machine in Yanji County, Jilin, the bamboo splitting machine in Shanghai and Hunan, the bamboo and wood essential oil distillation equipment in Shanghai and Hubei, and the indigenous tannin extract production equipment in Mayang, Hunan, and Jianhe, Guizhou, are also being imitated and promoted in many regions.

Commercial departments in various regions have also coordinated with relevant departments to arrange the cultivation of certain local specialties, transforming wild resources into domestic resources, and cultivating more sources of goods for future native produce procurement.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, February 23rd. A purchasing upsurge has recently swept through the major cotton-producing areas of Shanxi Province. The province has now completed more than 95% of its cotton procurement plan for 1959-1960. Among the 44 counties in the province's main cotton-producing areas, 17 have completed their plans, and 16 are in the process of completing the final work.

At the beginning of this cotton purchasing campaign, local Party committees strengthened their leadership over weak links, organized exchanges of acquisition experience, and promoted cotton acquisition work in areas with slow progress. The Jinan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China strengthened its leadership over the four counties of Linfen, Hongdong, and others, where the completion of the plan was not satisfactory. It sent leading cadres to these four counties to help with the work and established a daily, every-other-day, and five-day cotton acquisition evaluation system, which quickly pushed the cotton acquisition closing work of various communes to a climax. Commune members in the Jinan cotton-producing area actively searched for fallen cotton, stiff cotton, and "eyelashes," ensuring that the fields were clean, the threshing grounds were clean, and the cotton stalks were thoroughly harvested. According to incomplete statistics from several counties such as Yuncheng, Hongdong, and Ruicheng, they retrieved more than 230,000 jin of lint cotton and 3,340,000 jin of seed cotton, which could be used to acquire more than 1,340,000 jin of lint cotton. As a result of the "three searches," the harvest volume per mu of cotton fields in Yuncheng, Ruicheng, Linyi and other counties increased by five jin. Many old thrift households also competed to sell their surplus cotton accumulated over the years to the state.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, February 21st. The cotton procurement volume in various cotton-producing areas of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has been increasing daily recently. The daily cotton procurement volume in early February increased by 37% compared to late January, and the average daily procurement volume in the first five days of mid-February increased nearly twofold compared to early February.

After the Spring Festival, the Party committees of cotton-producing areas in Xinjiang generally took the lead, headed by the secretary, to strengthen the leadership of the cotton acquisition work. The Aksu Prefectural Committee, headed by the first secretary of the prefectural committee, transferred more than 150 cadres to form a working group, which went to various communes and production teams to publicize to commune members the significance of completing the cotton sales task ahead of schedule in supporting national construction and increasing commune income, further implemented the acquisition policy, and increased the number of acquisition points to facilitate commune members' cotton sales. The cotton acquisition volume in early February increased greatly compared to before the Spring Festival. In areas such as Kashi, Hotan, and Shanshan, due to the scattered residences and tight transportation capacity, the transportation work often could not keep up with the needs of cotton acquisition before the Spring Festival. Recently, these areas have uniformly arranged labor, sending production materials to the countryside on the one hand and transporting cotton to the city on the other, ensuring that the vehicles and horses do not return empty, greatly saving labor and transportation capacity, and also promoting the progress of cotton acquisition. Hotan Prefecture is close to completing its annual cotton procurement plan.

    为工业继续跃进备好原料
    全国一月份土产采购额相当于去年上半年总额的70％
    山西新疆产棉区广大社员积极出售棉花支援国家建设
    新华社23日讯　全国土产采购工作，今年一开始就做出良好的成绩。据商业部最近统计，1月份全国土产采购总额达七亿多元，完成了第一季度计划的61．4％，相当于去年上半年采购总额的70％。贵州、湖南、福建等省已提前两个月超额完成了第一季度的采购计划。各种主要品种的采购情况也很好。如棕片，到2月上旬为止的采购量完成了第一季度计划的69．7％，松香完成58．7％，松节油完成59％。
    各地土产采购部门都积极参与生产，帮助人民公社制订多种经营规划，建立土产品生产基地，同时在去年“小秋收”运动的基础上，以扶植社办工业为主，协助有关部门开展了群众性的土产加工运动。如湖南保靖县发动群众大搞麻袋、酒精、纸浆、栲胶、芳香油等加工综合利用，到1月底已办起各种加工厂一千二百二十七个，比去年年底增加八百五十一个；仅野生纤维纺织麻袋的日产量，就由去年的六十三条提高到六百条。
    目前，各地土产采购部门正在进行土产加工的技术革新，推广先进加工机具和经验，进一步提高土产品的产量和质量。江苏吴县商业局创造了铁木制织草席机，比原来的木制机提高工效十倍。河北省已初步创造了割苇、破苇、编席机，为实现苇席生产机械化创造了条件，现在正在继续改进和推广。此外，辽宁本溪的扁担机、柄把机，吉林延吉县的草袋机，上海、湖南等地的破篾机，上海、湖北等地的竹木制芳香油蒸馏设备，湖南麻阳、贵州剑河的土法生产栲胶设备，也在许多地区仿制和推广。
    各地商业部门还协同有关部门安排了某些土特产品的培育工作，变野生为家生，为今后的土产采购培育更多的货源。
    新华社太原23日电　山西省各主要产棉地区最近普遍掀起了购棉扫尾高潮。全省1959至1960年度的棉花收购计划现已完成95％以上。全省主要棉产地区的四十四个县中，已经有十七个县完成计划，有十六个县正在结束扫尾工作。
    在这次购棉扫尾运动一开始，各地党委就加强对薄弱环节的领导，组织各地交流收购经验，推动了进展较慢的地区的棉花收购工作。中共晋南地委加强对完成计划情况不好的临汾、洪洞等四个县的领导，派出领导干部到这四个县帮助工作，建立日日评、隔日评、五日评的棉花收购评比制度，推动各公社的购棉结尾工作很快走向高潮。晋南产棉区的人民公社社员们积极寻找落地棉、僵瓣棉和“眼睫毛”，做到地里拾净，场里拣净，棉秆上采净。据运城、洪洞、芮城等几个县不完全的统计，他们共找回了皮棉二十三万多斤，籽棉三百三十四万斤，可以多收购一百三十四万多斤皮棉。进行“三找”的结果，运城、芮城、临猗等县每亩棉田的收获量增加了五斤。还有很多老节约户，也争着把自己几年来积下来的多余棉花卖给国家。
    新华社乌鲁木齐21日电　新疆维吾尔自治区各产棉地区近来的棉花收购量逐日上升。2月上旬每天收购的棉花比1月下旬增加37％，中旬前五天的平均日收购量又比上旬上升近一倍。
    春节以后，新疆各产棉地区的党委普遍由书记挂帅，加强了对棉花收购工作的领导。阿克苏专区由地委第一书记挂帅，抽调了一百五十多个干部组成工作组，到各公社、生产队向社员们宣传提前完成售棉任务对支援国家建设、增加公社收入的意义，进一步贯彻收购政策，同时增设了收购点，便利社员售棉，2月上旬收购的棉花比春节前大大增加。喀什、和田、鄯善等地区由于住地分散，运力紧张，春节以前运输工作常常跟不上棉花收购工作的需要。最近这些地区统一安排了劳动力，一面送生产资料下乡，一面运棉花进城，做到了车不空行，马不空鞍，大大节省劳力和运力，也促进了棉花收购进度。和田专区已接近完成全年度的购棉计划。
