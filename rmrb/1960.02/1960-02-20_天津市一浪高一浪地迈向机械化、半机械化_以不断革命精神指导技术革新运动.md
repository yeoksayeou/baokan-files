    Tianjin advances towards mechanization and semi-mechanization wave upon wave, guiding the technical innovation movement with the spirit of continuous revolution
    Breakthroughs in the weak links with heavy manual labor, quickly setting off a high tide in all walks of life
    Expanding the scope and methods of collaboration, so that the experience of one factory quickly becomes the experience of the entire industry
    (People's Daily, Tianjin, February 19th, reporter Huang Jun) The industrial front in Tianjin is guiding the mass movement with the spirit of continuous revolution, so that the waves of technical innovation and technical revolution are sweeping every corner of the city. From modern large factories to the considerable number of street industries, those engaged in manual labor are fiercely attacking mechanization and semi-mechanization, and those who have already achieved mechanization are moving non-stop towards continuous and automated stages.
    The in-depth development of technical innovation and technical revolution is rapidly changing the face of production throughout the city. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the city has increased from 42% last year to the current 54%, and more than 160 automatic production lines have emerged. In many factories, heavy manual labor has been replaced by conveyor belts, cranes, power hammers, and pipelines. The new production capacity guarantees a comprehensive and continued leap forward in production. The city's total industrial output value in January overfulfilled the plan, increasing by 51% compared with the same period last year, and the output of 47 comparable products increased by more than 80%. In the first half of February, the total output value increased by 3.25% compared with the first half of January. With the continuous and rapid progress of technical innovation and technical revolution, profound changes have also taken place in people's mental outlook, and the communist style of daring to think and act in the leap forward era has been further promoted.
    To realize mechanization and semi-mechanization at high speed with the spirit of continuous revolution through concentrated efforts is a characteristic of the current technical innovation and technical revolution movement in Tianjin. The city first organized forces to focus on the technical innovation of the six major types of work with more heavy manual labor, such as foundry work, fitter work, and forging work, and the nine major industries such as shoemaking, salt industry, and paper products, quickly setting off a high tide throughout the city. Various industries boldly mobilized the masses to formulate plans, organize assault months, assault ten-day periods, and assault weeks, concentrate superior forces, make breakthroughs in one place, then make breakthroughs in another place, achieve a batch, and then achieve another batch, ensuring that the movement is higher than each wave, and the scale is larger each time. In just over a month, the degree of mechanization in the city increased rapidly, the crushing process increased by 10%, the forging process increased by 9%, and the foundry process increased by 4%. At this time, some people developed new complacency in their thinking. The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out in a timely manner: The technical revolution movement is also a ideological revolution movement, requiring leading cadres of factories and enterprises to further establish the spirit of continuous revolution, so that the technical revolution movement can continue to move forward. After criticizing the idea that there was no more "oil to be squeezed" from the technical revolution at the end of last year, the Tianjin Bicycle Factory achieved the first automatic production line for electroplating in the first twenty days of this year; seventeen processes are completely automatically controlled by electricity, and only three people are needed to watch the machine, which can top the workload of twenty people in the past, the output of bicycle handlebars has also increased by more than double, and the quality of the products has also been significantly improved. The workers, holding high the red flag of continuous revolution, have recently achieved six major innovations in the past twenty days, such as the automation of saddle assembly, the automation of salt furnace copper welding, and the automatic thread rolling of screws. Since the beginning of this year, the Agricultural Machinery Factory has continuously organized three upsurges of technical innovation and technical revolution movements, focusing on the weak links in production. In just over a month, 155 major innovation proposals have emerged throughout the factory, ensuring the sustained leap forward in production.
    With the extensive and in-depth development of technical innovation and technical revolution, the competition between the same industry and the same type of work is gradually expanding into a city-wide production technology selection and performance meeting. From the group to the workshop, from the factory to the industry, from the district to the city, selections are made at each level, models are established, various experiences created by the masses are taken to learn from each other's strengths and make up for one's weaknesses through performance selection, and complete sets are formed for comprehensive promotion. According to incomplete statistics from the five districts of Hebei, Hedong, Nankai, Tanggu, and Hangu, more than 1.3 million people participated in the performance selection activities at all levels in early February, and more than 80,000 innovation proposals were put forward, and more than 5,000 advanced experiences were summarized and promoted. Among the 130,000 textile workers in the city, more than 10,000 advanced models of various types and more than 100 advanced collectives have emerged through the performance selection competition. The advanced are becoming more advanced, and the backward are also catching up with the advanced, and the technical operation level of the workers has been generally improved. Through this performance selection competition, 85% of the more than 2,000 workers in the sewing workshop of the Tianjin Knitting Factory have improved their skills, and the technical level of 155 of them has been upgraded.
    To adapt to the new situation in the development of technical innovation and technical revolution, the spirit of communist large-scale collaboration among factories and enterprises in Tianjin is constantly developing and improving. In terms of collaboration content, it has developed from mutual exchange of materials and exchange of technical experience to collaborative use of technical forces, production equipment, tools, and technical data; the scope of collaboration has developed from collaboration between factories within an industry to large-scale collaboration throughout the district and city; from temporary collaboration relationships to institutionalization and regularisation. Many districts have formed collaboration networks; some districts have also established regular professional meetings and collaborative conferences. "If one factory has difficulties, all factories come to help," and "Large factories lead small factories, and small factories help large factories" are visible everywhere. In this way, the experience of the group quickly becomes the experience of the whole factory, and the experience of one factory quickly becomes the experience of the whole industry. For example, Hexi District organized 107 factories in the district into 12 fixed collaborative groups, with large factories as the mainstay, and held collaborative meetings regularly. At the collaborative conference in January, they supported each other with 93 tons of steel and more than 10 tons of casting processing, solving key problems for 84 factories; in less than ten days, 22 small machinery factories in the district jointly helped the Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory to complete the task of high-speed shuttle changing for 1,000 cloth machines, increasing production efficiency by about 10%.

    天津市一浪高一浪地迈向机械化、半机械化
    以不断革命精神指导技术革新运动
    突破笨重体力劳动较多的薄弱环节，迅速在各行各业掀起高潮
    扩大协作范围和协作方法，使一厂经验迅速成为全行业的经验
    本报天津19日电　记者黄军报道：天津市工业战线以不断革命的精神指导群众运动，使技术革新和技术革命的浪潮席卷全市各个角落。从现代化的大工厂，到为数不少的街道工业，从事手工劳动的正在猛攻机械化、半机械化，已经实现机械化的，不停止地迈向连续化、自动化阶段。
    技术革新和技术革命的深入发展，迅速改变着全市生产面貌。全市机械化、半机械化程度已由去年的42％提高到目前的54％，并涌现出一百六十多条自动生产线。许多工厂的笨重体力劳动已为传送带、吊车、汽锤、管道所代替。新的生产能力保证了生产的全面继续跃进。全市1月份工业总产值超额完成了计划，比去年同期增长了51％，有四十七种可比产品的产量增加了80％以上。进入2月上半月，总产值又比1月上半月增长了3．25％。随着技术革新和技术革命不断的迅猛进展，也引起了人们的精神面貌的深刻变化，跃进时代敢想敢干的共产主义风格进一步发扬。
    以不断革命的精神，集中突击，高速度地实现机械化、半机械化，是天津市当前技术革新和技术革命运动的特点。全市首先组织力量突击笨重体力劳动较多的铸工、钳工、锻工等六大工种和制鞋、盐业、纸制品等九大行业的技术革新，迅速在全市掀起高潮。各个行业放手发动群众制定规划，组织突击月、突击旬、突击周，集中优势兵力，突破一处，再突破一处，实现一批，再实现一批，保证了运动一浪比一浪高，规模一次比一次大。一个多月中全市机械化程度迅速提高，破碎工种提高了10％，锻打工种提高了9％，铸工种提高了4％。就在这个时候，有些人在思想上产生了新的自满情绪。中共天津市委及时指出：技术革命运动，也是一个思想革命运动，要求各工厂企业的领导干部进一步树立不断革命精神，使技术革命运动不断向前发展。天津自行车厂在去年年底批判了认为技术革命已经没有什么“油水”了的思想以后，在今年的头二十天里，实现了电镀的第一条自动生产线；十七道工序完全由电气自动控制，只用三个人看管机器，就顶上过去二十个人的工作量，镀自行车大把的产量还提高一倍以上，产品质量也显著提高。职工们高举不断革命的红旗，在最近二十天里，又实现了车鞍装配自动化、盐炉铜焊自动化及螺丝自动搓扣等六项重大革新。农业机械厂今年以来，针对生产中的薄弱环节，连续组织了三次技术革新和技术革命运动的高潮。仅一个多月的时间，全厂就涌现了一百五十五项重大革新建议，保证了生产的持续跃进。
    随着技术革新和技术革命的广泛深入，逐步使同行业、同工种间的竞赛，进一步扩展为全市性的生产技术选拔运动会。从小组到车间、从工厂到行业、从区到市，层层选拔，大树标兵，把群众创造出来的各种各样的经验，通过表演选拔，取长补短，成龙配套，全面推广。仅据河北、河东、南开、塘沽、汉沽五个区的不完全统计，在2月上旬就有一百三十多万人次参加了逐级表演选拔活动，提出了革新建议八万多件，总结和推广了各种先进经验五千多项。在全市十三万多名纺织工人中，通过表演选拔赛，就涌现出各类先进标兵一万多名，先进集体一百多个。先进的更先进，落后的也赶上了先进，工人的技术操作水平普遍提高。天津针织厂缝纫车间的两千多名工人，通过这次表演选拔赛，有85％的人都提高了技术，其中有一百五十五人的技术水平提高了一级。
    适应技术革新和技术革命运动发展的新形势，天津市各工厂企业共产主义大协作的精神不断发展提高。在协作内容上，由原材料上的互通有无、交流技术经验，发展到技术力量、生产设备、工具、技术资料等方面协作使用；协作的范围从一个行业中厂与厂之间协作，发展为全区、全市性的大协作；从临时协作关系，走向制度化、经常化。许多区组成了协作网；有的区还建立了定期专业会、协作会议。“一厂有困难，各厂来帮助”、“大厂带小厂，小厂助大厂”，到处可见。这样，就使小组经验迅速成为全厂经验，一厂经验迅速成为全行业经验。例如河西区把全区的一百零七个厂，以大厂为主，组织了十二个固定的协作小组，定期召开协作会议。在1月份的协作大会上，互相支援了九十三吨钢材和铸件加工十吨多，解决了八十四个工厂的关键问题；全区二十二个小机械厂，不到十天，共同帮助天津第四棉纺织厂完成了一千台布机高速换梭的任务，使生产效率提高10％左右。
