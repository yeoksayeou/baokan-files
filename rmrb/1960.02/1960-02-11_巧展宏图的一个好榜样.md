    A Good Example of Skillfully Drawing a Grand Blueprint
    Since the Great Leap Forward, many factories have sprung up from scratch in various places. Today, the Shenyang Dadong District Steel Ball Bearing Factory, reported in this newspaper, can be considered a good example of starting a business empty-handed, establishing a career, developing production at high speed, and carrying out technological transformation.
    In our country, under the shining light of the General Line, starting from scratch and vigorously developing industry is not a rare thing, but it is still relatively uncommon to carry out technological transformation at high speed after starting from scratch. Perhaps some people have not even thought that some people who were empty-handed, and 80% of whom were housewives, actually manufactured more than 100 machines themselves in just over a year and established such a large factory, producing 150,000 sets of steel ball bearings annually, with products selling well in 22 provinces and cities. Isn't this high speed? What does this kind of high-speed development illustrate? First, it is correct to use indigenous methods; having indigenous machinery provides the prerequisite for technological transformation; without indigenous methods, there is no transformation to speak of. Second, the transition from indigenous to foreign is not a long process, but can be achieved in a relatively short period of time. Some people think that our use of indigenous methods is a last resort, but they do not know that our use of indigenous methods is a strategic measure. Using indigenous methods only signifies the beginning of things, not the end; first using indigenous methods, then gradually mechanizing and automating, is precisely our goal of high-speed progress.
    How can we shorten the process from indigenous to foreign and achieve high speed? In fact, there is no special secret here. From the deeds of the Dadong District Steel Ball Bearing Factory, the following formula can be derived: revolutionary enthusiasm plus technological innovation equals high speed. Soaring revolutionary enthusiasm and heroic ambition are the driving force for high-speed progress, while mass-based technological revolution and technological innovation are the path to high-speed progress. With soaring revolutionary enthusiasm and heroic ambition, one can be fearless of difficulties and constantly make revolution. With the shortcut of technological innovation and technological revolution, one can skillfully draw a grand blueprint and achieve twice the result with half the effort.
    Currently, various places are vigorously promoting mechanization and semi-mechanization. In order to accelerate the process of mechanization, looking at the deeds of the Dadong District Steel Ball Bearing Factory can not only provide tremendous encouragement but also provide tremendous enlightenment.

    巧展宏图的一个好榜样
    大跃进以来，各个地方都出现了一些白手起家的工厂，今天，本报报道的沈阳大东区钢珠轴承厂，可算是赤手空拳，创家立业，高速度发展生产和进行技术改造的一个好榜样。
    在我们的国家里，在总路线的光辉照耀下，白手起家，大办工业，并不是什么希罕的事情，而白手起家以后又高速度进行技术改造，还是不太多的。也许有些人连想也没有想过，一些手无寸铁的人，而且80％是家庭妇女，竟然在短短一年多的时间里，自己制造出了一百多台机器，办起了这样一个大工厂，年产钢珠轴承十五万套，产品畅销二十二个省市。这不是高速度是什么？像这样的高速度的发展说明什么问题呢？第一、土法上马是正确的，有了土的机械，就为技术改造提供了前提，没有土的，也就谈不上什么改造了。第二、从土到洋不是一个漫长的过程，而是能够在较短的时间之内实现的。有一些人认为我们的土法上马是不得已的办法，却不知道我们的土法上马是一种战略性的措施。土法上马只是意味着事情的开始，而不是事情的终结，土法先上马，逐步机械化和自动化，正是我们高速度前进的目标。
    怎样才能缩短由土到洋的过程，取得高速度？其实，这里没有什么特别的奥妙。从大东区钢珠轴承厂的事迹中，可以得出如下的公式：革命干劲加技术革新，就可以高速度。冲天的革命干劲和豪迈的雄心壮志，是高速度前进的动力，而群众性的技术革命和技术革新，则是高速度前进的途径。有了冲天的革命干劲和豪迈的雄心壮志，就能不畏艰险，不断革命。有了技术革新和技术革命的捷径，就能巧展宏图，事半功倍。
    目前，各地正在大搞机械化和半机械化，为了加速机械化进程，看看大东区钢珠轴承厂的事迹，不仅可以得到巨大的鼓舞，而且可以得到巨大的启示。
