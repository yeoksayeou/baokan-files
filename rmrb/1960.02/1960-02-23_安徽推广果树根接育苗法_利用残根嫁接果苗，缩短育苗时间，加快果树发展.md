(Xinhua News Agency, Hefei) Anhui's Dangshan County Orchard Farm's creation of the fruit tree root grafting seedling method has been proven in practice to be of great significance for high-speed development of fruit production. Recently, the Anhui Provincial Forestry Department held an on-site meeting at this orchard farm to summarize and promote this method. It is planned that this spring, the province will root graft and cultivate one hundred million apple and pear seedlings. After the completion of this plan, four million mu of orchards can be planted, while the entire province's planting area for apple and pear seedlings last year was only 172,000 mu.

Dangshan Orchard Farm's fruit tree root grafting seedling method was successfully tested in 1958, and by the winter of 1959, they had cultivated more than 200,000 qualified apple and pear seedlings using this method. The biggest advantage of using this method to cultivate fruit tree seedlings is that it can use fruit seedling residual roots, fruit tree tender roots, and fruit tree one-year-old branches for grafting, which can effectively solve the difficulty of lacking fruit tree rootstocks and insufficient seeds. In addition, the ordinary method of cultivating fruit tree seedlings first requires using seeds for seedling cultivation, and seed cultivation takes a long time. For example, cultivating apple and pear seedlings generally requires first cultivating rootstock seedlings, which are grafted after one or two years, and it takes until the third year for the seedlings to be ready for transplanting. However, using the root grafting seedling method, fruit tree seedlings can be ready for transplanting in the same year, greatly shortening the seedling time.

Introduction to Fruit Tree Root Grafting Seedling Method

The fruit seedling residual roots and fruit tree tender roots used for grafting fruit tree branches are called "rootstocks." Rootstocks should be collected during the period from late November to April of the following year. Broken roots and residual roots from winter seedling transplanting and waste roots remaining from digging up nursery land can be used as rootstocks. One-year-old roots of large fruit trees such as hairy peaches, mountain apricots, apples, pears, and peaches can also be dug up as rootstocks (roots older than two years are not easy to graft due to tissue lignification). After collecting the rootstocks, if they are not used immediately, they can be graded according to thickness and stored separately in cellars.

The fruit tree branches grafted to the rootstocks are called "scions." The collection of scions can be combined with winter fruit tree pruning. However, only one-year-old branches that are relatively thin, fully lignified, and have plump buds can be used as "scions." They can be grafted as they are collected, or they can be collected and stored in cellars centrally. The storage temperature should be maintained at 4-7°C, and the soil moisture content should be maintained at about 6% to 7%.

Root grafting method: According to the different thicknesses of the rootstocks and scions, grafting methods such as cleft grafting, whip grafting, side grafting, tongue grafting, and inverted side grafting are used respectively. Generally, side grafting has the highest survival rate.

Operation method of side grafting: Select a rootstock with a thickness of 2.5 mm, cut it into a small section about 10 cm long, with several small fine roots on each section. Then, on the smooth surface 4-5 mm from the upper end of the rootstock, cut a small opening with a knife, and the cut should be about 30 degrees to the longitudinal axis of the root. The depth of the cut should be one-third or one-half longer than the cut surface of the scion. The scion should be cut from a one-year-old developing branch with two plump buds, and then the lower base of the scion should be beveled into a wedge shape with one side slightly thicker and one side slightly thinner. Then insert it into the cut, so that the cambium of the two wounds are closely combined, then bind and apply sticky mud. Since the bark thickness of the scion and rootstock are different, for example, the bark of the apple scion is thinner than that of the crabapple rootstock, and the bark of the pear scion is thicker than that of the wild pear rootstock. Therefore, strict attention must be paid to the close alignment of the cambium of the two to ensure survival.

Storage method: After root grafting, it must be stored so that the interface produces callus tissue during the storage period. In areas with less rainfall and easy cellar construction, cellar storage can be used. First, place the root-grafted seedlings obliquely or horizontally in the cellar, put a layer of root-grafted seedlings and then a layer of sand, so that the root-grafted seedlings are in close contact with the sand until the cellar is full. In areas with more rainfall and not easy to build cellars, it can be temporarily planted in a hotbed or unheated greenhouse, that is, the grafted root-grafted seedlings are bundled into bundles of fifty plants, and placed directly on the loosened soil, and covered with wet sand above the interface to one to two centimeters. The storage temperature is maintained at around 5°C, and the soil moisture content is around 5%. After the weather warms up, it can be taken out and planted in the nursery. About 15,000 plants are planted per mu. First use a small hoe to open a hole and plant the seedlings in the hole. When planting, the fine roots should not be curled, and the planting depth should be such that the first bud of the ear is level with the ground, and tamped firmly, and then the soil should be cultivated above the interface.

    安徽推广果树根接育苗法
    利用残根嫁接果苗，缩短育苗时间，加快果树发展
    编者按：目前正是植树造林季节。发展果树生产是许多国营农场和山区人民公社开展多种经营的重要项目之一。正在这个时候，砀山果园场创造了多快好省的育苗办法——根接育苗法，这是好事情，希望各地研究推广。
    新华社合肥讯　安徽砀山县果园场创造的果树根接育苗法已被实践证明，对高速度地发展水果生产具有重要意义。最近，安徽省林业厅在这个果园场召开了现场会议，总结和推广了这一方法。计划今春全省根接培育苹果苗、梨苗一亿株。这个计划完成以后，可以栽植四百万亩果园，而全省去年苹果苗、梨苗的栽植面积才只有十七万二千多亩。
    砀山果园场果树根接育苗法是1958年试验成功的，到1959年冬，他们用这个方法培育了二十多万株合乎要求的苹果苗和梨树苗。使用这种方法培育果树苗，最大的一个好处是，可以利用果苗残根、果树嫩根与果树一年生枝嫁接，能有效地解决缺乏果树砧木和种子不足的困难；另外，用普通方法培育果树苗，首先要用种子育苗，而种子育苗要花很长的时间。例如培育苹果苗、梨树苗，一般是先培育砧木苗，一、两年后才嫁接，要到第三年才能成苗出圃。而用根接育苗法育苗，果树苗当年就能成苗出圃，大大缩短了育苗时间。果树根接育苗法介绍
    嫁接果树枝条的果苗残根、果树嫩根，叫作“砧根”。砧根要在11月下旬至第二年4月这段时间内采集。可以利用冬季苗木出圃时的断根、残根以及挖掘苗圃地残留的废根作为砧根。也可以挖掘毛桃、山杏、苹果、梨、桃等大果树的一年生根作为砧根（二年生以上的根，因组织木质化，嫁接不易成活）。砧根采集后，如不立即使用，可按粗细程度分级，分别窖藏。
    和砧根嫁接的果树枝条，叫作“接穗”。接穗的采集，可结合冬季果树修剪进行。但是必须是枝条较细而又充分木质化、芽子饱满的一年生枝，才能作为“接穗”。可以随采随接，或者采集后集中进行窖藏。窖藏的温度应保持在4—7℃，土壤含水量保持6％至7％左右。
    根接方法：根据砧根和接穗的不同粗度，分别采用劈接、切接、腹接、舌接、倒腹接等嫁接方法。一般以腹接成活率最高。
    腹接的操作方法：选择粗度在二点五毫米的砧根，剪截成长十厘米左右的一小段，每段根上带有几条小细根。随后在离砧根上端四到五毫米处的光滑面，用刀子切一小口，其切口应与根的纵轴成三十度左右。切口深度应比接穗的削面长三分之一或二分之一；接穗应剪取带有两个饱满芽子的一年生发育枝，再于接穗下部的基部两侧削成一侧稍厚、一侧稍薄的斜楔形削面，然后插入切口，使二者伤口的形成层密切结合，随后绑扎，并涂上粘泥。由于接穗和砧根的皮层厚度不同，例如，苹果接穗的皮层比海棠砧根的皮层为薄，梨接穗的皮层比棠梨砧根的皮层为厚，因此，必须严格注意两者形成层的紧密对齐，才能保证成活。
    贮藏的方法：根接后必须经过贮藏，使接口在贮藏期中产生愈合组织。在雨水较少容易作窖的地区可采用窖藏，先把根接苗斜放或平放于窖中，放一层根接苗即放一层沙，使根接苗与沙密切接触，直到把窖装满为止。在雨水较多不易窖藏的地区，可假植在温床或不加温的温室内，即把已接好的根接苗，每五十株捆成一捆，直放在已挖松的土壤上，上面复湿沙至接口以上一至二厘米处。贮藏温度保持在5℃左右，土壤含水量5％左右。天气转暖以后，即可取出栽植于苗圃地。每亩栽植一万五千株左右。先用小锄开穴，将苗木栽于穴中。栽时细根不要卷曲，栽植深度使穗顶第一芽与地面相平，踩实，然后培土至接口以上。　（新华社）
