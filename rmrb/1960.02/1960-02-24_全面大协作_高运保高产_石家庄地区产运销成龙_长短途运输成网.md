Full-Scale Collaboration Ensures High Transport Volume and High Production
Shijiazhuang Region Integrates Production, Transportation, and Sales; Long and Short-Distance Transportation Forms a Network

(Reported by our newspaper) The Shijiazhuang Special District in Hebei Province has universally launched a large-scale collaborative transport effort integrating production, transportation, and sales. From mountainous areas to plains, from cities to rural areas, and from railways to highways, a comprehensive "dragon network" for transportation has been realized. In addition to the thirteen "dragons" formed by the special district, city, and counties, people's communes, mines, and factories have also formed two hundred and fifty-three "dragons." Without increasing manpower or vehicles, the total transport volume completed by this special district in the fourth quarter of last year increased by an average of 1.2 times compared to the previous three quarters. In January of this year, highway transportation overfulfilled the state plan by 63%, and railway transportation overfulfilled the state plan by nearly 20%.

The significant achievements of the large-scale transport collaboration in the Shijiazhuang area are primarily due to the strengthened leadership of the Party Committee. The Shijiazhuang Prefectural Party Committee established a transportation leadership group, headed by Comrade Li Shi, Secretary of the Prefectural Party Committee Secretariat, and including representatives from the municipal party committee and relevant departments. The secretaries of the county, commune, and large factory and mine Party committees also personally oversaw transportation work. The Shijiazhuang Prefectural Party Committee also organized leading cadres to study, examine departmentalism, and establish an overall perspective, while simultaneously educating the broad masses of workers and staff about communist large-scale collaboration. On this basis, nearly seventy units signed "collaboration covenants," laying a solid ideological foundation for the one-dragon transport collaboration.

The one-dragon transport collaboration in the Shijiazhuang area has a rigorous organizational structure. Under the leadership of the Prefectural Party Committee, the general collaboration office is composed of the municipal party committee secretary, the mayor, and responsible cadres from the transportation, industrial production, planning, and finance and trade committees, the railway office, the transportation bureau, the metallurgical industry bureau, and the handling company. The general collaboration office leads the general dispatching office, which has six functional departments: consignment planning, railway transportation, loading and unloading dispatching, material distribution, and financial accounting. Each department has clear collaboration systems and scopes of authority. Collaboration organizations have been established in each county and people's commune. The collaboration organizations of cities, counties, people's communes, railways, highways, loading and unloading companies, and factories and mines are linked both vertically and horizontally, establishing a system of connection. This connects regions, departments, and levels together through collaboration.

"Five Unifications" are important features of the one-dragon transport collaboration in the Shijiazhuang area.

First, unified consignment planning. Various units are divided into seven systems according to industry. Each system sends representatives to participate in the consignment planning department of the general dispatching office. Under unified leadership, they compile the monthly consignment plan for their system and participate in the review and approval of the consignment plan. The advantage of this approach is that it ensures the consignment of key materials while also ensuring that general materials are reasonably queued. The past phenomenon of disputes has been replaced by a collaborative style.

Second, unified use of railway sidings (i.e., internal factory railway lines) and connecting lines (i.e., railway lines from public railway lines to the factory). In the past, even if the connecting lines and sidings of other factories were idle, units without sidings had "no right" to use them, and often had to load and unload materials at very distant freight yards, causing congestion of materials at the freight yards. After consultation, unified use of all railway sidings and connecting lines in the city has been implemented. This expanded the scope of use of sidings and connecting lines and increased the number of loading spaces, with the newly added loading spaces being more than twice the original loading spaces of Shijiazhuang Station.

Third, unified allocation and transfer of materials. In the past, due to the large number of receiving units for group freight cars arriving in Shijiazhuang, the station had to break up the arriving vehicles into smaller parts and transfer them separately, which directly affected the turnover of vehicles. Now, for smelting and construction materials (limestone, coal, slag, sand) arriving in Shijiazhuang, as long as the variety is uniform, group freight cars of five or more vehicles, regardless of the number of receiving units, are uniformly transferred and settled through a single hook of cars. In order to achieve unified and rational distribution of materials, the material distribution department of the collaboration office conducts unified allocation based on the principles of "ensuring production, facilitating transportation, and taking care of handling."

Fourth, unified use of handling tools and deployment of loading and unloading workers. Under the unified leadership of the collaboration office, the loading and unloading dispatching department uniformly utilizes forces. Railway and automobile loading and unloading are uniformly divided into four loading and unloading areas, with loading and unloading being carried out in sections, unified dispatching, cross-operations, and mutual support, overcoming the phenomenon of uneven workload and tapping handling potential. In addition, a portion of the freight vehicles from government agencies and enterprises have formed a reserve automobile battalion, which is uniformly dispatched and used.

Fifth, unified delivery and unified settlement. In the past, the consignment department had to go to five units, including railway, bus station, carriages, and bank, to complete formalities, even if they only transported half a vehicle of goods. As a result, each production unit had personnel running to the station, the procedures were complicated, and manpower was wasted. Now, these procedures are combined. As long as a letter of authorization is filled out, the general dispatching office will send a vehicle to pick up and deliver the goods. Transportation fees, loading and unloading fees, and handling fees are uniformly settled and transferred by the bank representative stationed in the collaboration office. All procedures are completed without leaving the collaboration office building.

### 全面大协作　高运保高产  石家庄地区产运销成龙　长短途运输成网

    全面大协作　高运保高产
    石家庄地区产运销成龙　长短途运输成网
    本报讯　河北省石家庄专区普遍开展产、运、销一条龙运输大协作，从山区到平原，从城市到农村，从铁路到公路，全面实现了运输“龙网化”。除专区、市、县组成十三条“龙”外，各人民公社、路矿、路厂等还组成了二百五十三条“龙”。这个专区在不增加人力和车辆的条件下，去年第四季度完成的总运量比前三个季度平均提高一点二倍。今年1月份公路运输超额63％完成了国家计划，铁路运输超额近20％完成了国家计划。
    石家庄地区的运输大协作所以能取得显著的成绩，首先是因为党委加强了领导。中共石家庄地委建立了交通运输领导小组，由地委书记处书记力矢同志挂帅，吸收市委和各有关部门参加。县、社、大厂矿党委书记也亲自掌握运输工作。中共石家庄地委还组织领导干部学习，检查本位主义，树立整体观念，同时向广大职工群众进行共产主义大协作的教育。在这个基础上，近七十个单位订出了“协作公约”，为一条龙运输大协作奠定了思想基础。
    石家庄地区的一条龙运输大协作，有一套严密的组织工作。在地委领导下，由市委书记、市长和交通运输、工业生产、计划、财贸等委员会、铁路办事处、交通运输局、冶金工业局、搬运公司等部门的负责干部组成总协作办公室。总协作办公室，领导总调度室，总调度室下设：托运计划、铁路运输、装卸调度、物资分配、财务会计等六个职能科，每个科室，都有明确的协作制度和职权范围。各县、人民公社都设立了协作组织。市、县、人民公社以及铁路、公路、装卸和厂矿企业的协作组织都上下左右挂钩，建立联系制度。这样就把地区之间、部门之间、上下之间从协作中联结在一起。
    “五统一”是石家庄地区一条龙运输大协作的重要特点。
    一，统一托运计划。各单位按行业分成了七个系统，各系统派代表参加总调度室的托运计划科，在统一领导下，编制本系统的月度托运计划，和参加托运计划审查定案。这样作的好处是，既保证重点物资的托运，又使一般物资作到合理排队，过去的争吵现象，被协作的风格代替了。
    二，统一使用铁路专用线（即厂内铁路线）和走行线（即从公用铁路线到厂内以前的铁路线）。过去即便外厂走行线和专用线闲着，没有专用线的单位也“无权”使用，只好经常到很远的货场装卸物资，造成货场物资堵塞。经过协商，将全市所有铁路专用线、走行线实行了统一使用。扩大了专用线、走行线的使用范围，增加了货位，新增的货位相当石家庄车站原货位的两倍多。
    三，统一分配调运物资。过去，到达石家庄的成组货车，由于收货单位多，车站就得把成组到达的车辆化整为零，拆散转送，这就直接影响了车辆的周转。现在，凡是到达石家庄的冶炼、基建物资（石灰石、煤、石渣、砂子），只要品种统一，五车以上的成组货车，不论几个收货单位，一律实行一勾送车转账结算。为了作到物资统一合理分配，协作办公室的物资分配科，本着“保证生产、便利运送、照顾搬运”的原则进行统一分配。
    四，统一使用搬运工具和调动装卸工人。在协作办公室统一领导下，由装卸调度科统一使用力量。把铁路和汽车装卸统一划分四个装卸区，分片装卸，统一调度，交叉作业互相支援，克服了忙闲不均的现象，挖掘了搬运潜力。另外一部分机关、企业的货运汽车，成立了汽车后备营，统一调度使用。
    五，统一送货，统一结算。过去托运部门，那怕运半车货，也要跑铁路、汽车站、马车、银行等五个单位办理手续，因而每个生产单位，都设有跑站人员，手续繁杂，浪费人力。现在这些手续合一，只要填个委托书，总调度室即派车取送，运杂费、装卸费、搬运费统一由银行住协作办公室的代表结算转账。不出协作办公室的大楼，一切手续都办妥了。
