The Power of the "Poor Stick" Spirit
Wang Pu

"The 'Poor Stick Cooperative' on the Industrial Front" is an outstanding communication. With full enthusiasm and vivid strokes, the author sings the praises of the heroic achievements created by the workers of the Kunming Pneumatic Tool Factory. Reading this communication, one cannot help but recall the Wang Guofan Cooperative, the "Poor Stick Cooperative" praised by Chairman Mao as "the image of our entire country" during the upsurge of agricultural cooperation. The twenty-three poor peasant households of the Wang Guofan Cooperative, with only three donkey legs, used their own efforts to "bring in from the mountains" a large number of means of production within three years, moving some visitors to tears. The branch secretary and seven veteran workers of the Kunming Pneumatic Tool Factory, starting with a pair of pliers, used their own efforts to manufacture a large amount of equipment within eight years, leaving many visitors in admiration. The Kunming Pneumatic Tool Factory is the "Poor Stick Cooperative" on the industrial front, and the branch secretary and seven veteran workers of this factory are the "Wang Guofan" on the industrial front. Relying on the great ambition of Marxism-Leninism, they have written for us the most glorious aspect of 650 million "poor sticks" running industry.

The Kunming Pneumatic Tool Factory developed by relying on poor methods. Its history is the history of the "poor stick" overcoming numerous difficulties. Their poor methods are very simple: if there are no materials, find them themselves; if there are no machines, build them themselves; if they don't understand the technology, study it themselves; if there are no workers, train them themselves; don't be discouraged by failure, and don't be arrogant when successful. However, this poor method is remarkable because it is a revolutionary spirit, a spirit of not being willing to lag behind, striving for advancement, not fearing difficulties, climbing peaks, liberating oneself, and giving the fullest play to human subjective initiative, a spirit of unyielding and continuous revolution, the "poor stick" spirit. This is the firmest and most thorough proletarian revolutionary spirit. In the revolutionary war, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our people relied on this spirit to defeat the powerful enemy and win the final victory. In socialist construction, relying on this spirit, poor teams can become rich teams, poor cooperatives can become rich cooperatives, small factories can become large factories, primitive factories can become modern factories, and "wooden scale" factories in all walks of life can become their own "pneumatic tool factories," and can create miracles.

Our emphasis on the "poor stick" spirit does not in the least negate or belittle the role of material and technical conditions. People cannot engage in production activities without certain material and technical conditions. However, material and technical conditions do not fall from the sky, but are created by people; even with material and technical conditions, they are still used by people. Emphasizing the "poor stick" spirit not only does not negate or belittle the role of material and technical conditions, but on the contrary, affirms and values the role of material and technical conditions. Because with the "poor stick" spirit of the Wang Guofan Cooperative and the Kunming Pneumatic Tool Factory, new material and technical conditions can be created the fastest, best, and most economically, and the role of material and technical conditions can be maximized.

From the miracle created by the Kunming Pneumatic Tool Factory, we once again see how great the subjective initiative of the people is in socialist construction. How can we fully mobilize people's subjective initiative? Some say that material incentives are a key. With material incentives, workers can be concerned about production. We say that the principle of material interest is needed, but it is impossible to activate people's subjective initiative by relying solely on material incentives. Take the Kunming Pneumatic Tool Factory as an example. Those seven veteran workers, working so tirelessly, thinking so hard, studying so diligently, and so stubbornly overcoming one difficulty after another, pushing production levels and technical levels to one peak after another, for eight years as if they were seven evergreen pines, were they doing it for the sake of earning a few more yuan in wages or a few more yuan in bonuses? Absolutely not. The lofty ideal of building a strong and prosperous socialist motherland inspires them. The only question in their minds is how to maximize the satisfaction of the country's needs, and how to maximize their contribution to the socialist cause. Therefore, when they had no raw materials and no machines, when they failed to trial-produce pneumatic tools once, twice, or three times, it was not how much material reward the leadership gave them, but the enthusiastic political support, it was Mao Zedong Thought that armed their minds and inspired them to go from victory to victory. Therefore, putting politics in command is the real key to fully mobilizing people's subjective initiative. A certain material encouragement is necessary, but without proletarian politics in command, there would be no poor methods, no "poor stick" spirit of continuous revolution. If we want to promote the "poor stick" spirit and use the magic weapon of poor methods, we must firmly grasp the key of putting politics in command.

    “穷棒子”精神的威力
    王朴
    “工业战线上的‘穷棒子社’”，是一篇出色的通讯。作者以满腔的热情，生动的笔调，歌颂了昆明风动工具厂职工们所创造的英雄业绩。读了这篇通讯，不由得想起农业合作化高潮时被毛主席赞为“我们整个国家的形象”的“穷棒子社”——王国藩合作社来。只有三条驴腿的王国藩合作社的二十三户贫农，用自己的努力，在三年时间内，“从山上取来”了大批的生产资料，使得有些参观的人感动得下泪。昆明风动工具厂的支部书记和七位老工人，从一把老虎钳起家，用自己的努力，在八年时间内，制造了大批设备，使得许多参观者赞叹不已。昆明风动工具厂，就是工业战线上的“穷棒子社”，这个厂的支部书记和七位老工人就是工业战线上的“王国藩”。他们靠着马克思列宁主义的雄心大志，为我们写下了六亿五千万“穷棒子”办工业的最光辉的一个侧面。
    昆明风动工具厂是靠穷办法发展起来的。它的历史是“穷棒子”战胜重重困难的历史。他们的穷办法，说来也很简单，就是没有材料自己找，没有机器自己造，不懂技术自己钻研，没有工人自己培养，失败不泄气，成功不骄傲。然而这个穷办法却很了不起，因为它是一种革命精神，一种不甘落后、力争上游、不畏艰难、攀登高峰、自己解放自己、最充分地发挥人的主观能动作用的精神，一种百折不挠的不断革命的“穷棒子”精神。这是最坚定、最彻底的无产阶级革命精神。在革命战争中，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，我国人民依靠这种精神，战胜了强大的敌人，夺得最后胜利。在社会主义建设中，依靠这种精神，穷队就可以变为富队，穷社就可以变为富社，小工厂就可以变为大工厂，土工厂就可以变为洋工厂，各行各业的“木杆秤”工厂就可以变为自己的“风动工具厂”，就可以创造人间奇迹。
    我们强调了“穷棒子”精神，一点也没有否定或者贬低物质技术条件的作用。人要从事生产活动，离开了一定的物质技术条件是不行的。然而，物质技术条件并不是从天而降，而是人创造的；有了物质技术条件，也是靠人来运用的。强调“穷棒子”精神，不但不是否定或者贬低物质技术条件的作用，而且相反，正是肯定和重视物质技术条件的作用。因为有了王国藩合作社、昆明风动工具厂的那种“穷棒子”精神，才能最快最好最省地创造新的物质技术条件，才能最大限度地发挥物质技术条件的作用。
    从昆明风动工具厂创造的奇迹中，我们再一次看到，在社会主义建设中，人民群众的主观能动作用是多么巨大。怎样才能把人的主观能动作用充分调动起来呢？有人说物质刺激是一把钥匙。有了物质刺激就能使职工群众关心生产。我们说，物质利益原则是需要的，但是只靠物质刺激是不可能开动人的主观能动作用的。拿昆明风动工具厂来说吧。那七位老工人，那样废寝忘食地劳动着，那样苦思苦想苦钻着，那样顽强地战胜一个困难又一个困难，把生产水平和技术水平推向一个高峰又一个高峰，八年如一日，真像七棵不老松，难道为的是想多得几元工资，多得几元奖金吗？决不是的。建设又强又富的社会主义祖国的崇高理想鼓舞着他们。他们脑子里想的只有一个问题，就是怎样最大限度地满足国家的需要，怎样才能最大限度地把自己的力量献给社会主义事业。因此，当他们没有原料，没有机器的时候，当他们试制风动工具一次、二次、三次不成功的时候，并不是领导方面给了多少物质奖励，而是政治上的热情支持，是毛泽东思想武装了他们头脑，鼓舞了他们从胜利走向胜利。所以，政治挂帅才是真正充分调动人的主观能动作用的钥匙。一定的物质鼓励是必要的，但是，没有无产阶级的政治挂帅，就没有穷办法，没有“穷棒子”的不断革命的精神。我们要发扬“穷棒子”精神，要使用穷办法这个法宝，就必须紧紧地掌握政治挂帅这把钥匙。
