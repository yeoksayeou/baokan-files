Picking Early, Sprouting Early, Harvesting More Tea
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Tea Research Institute

Tea production has seen two consecutive years of Great Leap Forward, yielding an important experience for high yield: "Early picking, late closing of the garden." In some tea-producing areas of China with similar natural conditions, differences in yield and quality arise from varying picking and closing times. For example, the tea-picking season in the Hangzhou tea area lasts as long as 240 days, with continuous leaps in unit yield. In contrast, the Qimen tea area in Anhui, with similar climatic conditions, has also seen increased yields in recent years, but the increase is smaller than that of Hangzhou due to the shorter picking season. Facts prove that extending the picking season is a crucial key to achieving an even greater leap forward in tea production.

However, some people believe that early picking is not advisable. Their reasons are: first, tea trees can only grow and sprout when the average daily temperature is above 10 degrees Celsius; early picking will not produce buds because the temperature is too low; second, early picking yields small buds and low output, which is not cost-effective and also affects the growth and development of the tea trees. Can we pick early? Our answer is affirmative. Of course, tea trees need a certain temperature to sprout, but temperature is only one of the comprehensive factors promoting sprouting; in addition to this condition, water, nutrients, and other factors are also needed. At the same time, when we do a good job in management work such as fertilization and cultivation, the temperature can also change to a certain extent with the degree to which people's subjective initiative is brought into play. Second, the tea tree is a leaf-harvesting crop with a strong regenerative ability; early picking leads to early sprouting. Third, early picking has many advantages; it is not "not cost-effective" but very cost-effective. Early picking can increase yield, improve quality, and regulate labor. Because early picking leads to early sprouting, the number of picking times can be increased, and the yield is high. Early picking yields "Mingqian" tea (tea picked before the Qingming Festival), and the longer the picking time, the better the quality and the more high-grade tea; early picking can more rationally arrange labor and reduce the phenomenon of excessive concentration of agricultural production labor. Thinking that early picking is impossible is unfounded.

There are many facts that prove early picking and early sprouting result in high yields and good quality. For example, the October Production Team of the Xihu People's Commune in Hangzhou City started picking on April 12, 1956, with a yield of 151 jin of dry tea per mu; in 1957, they started picking five days earlier on April 7 than the previous year, with a yield of 171 jin of dry tea per mu; in the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, due to measures such as strengthening grass mulching to prevent frost, early spring smoke to prevent frost, and early fertilization, the tea-picking season was nine days earlier than in 1957, with a yield of 236 jin of dry tea per mu; in 1959, on the basis of the 1958 Great Leap Forward, the picking season was eight days earlier than in 1958 due to more effective measures, starting on March 21, with a yield of 320 jin of dry tea per mu. By grasping the characteristics of early picking and early sprouting of tea trees and strengthening fertilizer management measures, the team not only achieved leaps in yield every year, but also increased the amount of high-grade tea every year.

Early picking does not mean picking small buds and small leaves before they meet the picking standard, as some people claim. What we mean by early picking is taking proactive measures to promote early germination of tea buds and picking when the buds and leaves reach the picking standard (one bud and one leaf for Longjing tea). Of course, in order to make tea trees germinate early and pick early, in addition to liberating thought and breaking with conventions, we must also try every means to take effective technical measures. According to the advanced experience of various places, to achieve early picking and early sprouting, we must currently focus on the following measures:

First, pile grass and smoke to overcome late frost. After the tea tree enters "dormancy," it undergoes a series of biochemical changes inside the tree due to prolonged exposure to low temperatures, accumulating certain self-defense substances (sugars and other soluble substances) and enhancing its cold resistance. However, when the spring temperature gradually rises, "dormancy" is released, and sprouting begins, the tree is filled with a large amount of water, and the substances within the cells tend to synthesize, reducing the content of soluble substances and significantly reducing the self-defense force; once cold attacks occur at this time, the tender buds will become scorched and their vitality will stagnate. Especially in the Jiangnan tea area, where the temperature is extremely unstable in February and March and there are often cold waves and late frosts, more attention should be paid to frost and cold protection.

Second, apply fertilizer early and apply more thermal fertilizer. The timing of tea tree sprouting is closely related to the amount of nutrients obtained by the tea tree. At present, tea trees generally receive less fertilizer and insufficient nutrition, resulting in poor cold resistance; plants with aging trees are more susceptible to frost damage and sprout later if they are undernourished. Therefore, early application of spring fertilizer to make the tea trees grow strong before spring is of great significance for enhancing the cold resistance of tea trees and promoting early sprouting. Because the root system is the first to become active before the spring tea buds germinate, early application of spring fertilizer can enable the root system to fully absorb nutrients and lay a material foundation for germination.

After the start of spring, when the temperature rises to above 5 degrees Celsius, the tea buds begin to grow, and then sprout and draw leaves rapidly as the temperature rises day by day. At this time, in addition to requiring a certain temperature, the tea tree also needs a large amount of water and nutrients, so it is very necessary to apply a bud-promoting fertilizer again to promote budding and increase growth.

Third, apply a large amount of water-soluble fertilizer to increase tea tree nutrition. Foliar fertilization of tea trees is a fertilization method created during the Great Leap Forward that uses less fertilizer and achieves greater results. Especially in early spring when the soil temperature is low and the root absorption capacity is not very strong, foliar fertilization can play a greater role. Tea tree leaves directly absorb nutrients, which can reduce the material transport process compared to root absorption, and can directly form the constituent substances of the tea tree through metabolism inside the leaves, which can better promote early sprouting and rapid growth of tea buds.

In addition, early spring plowing to increase soil water storage, pruning dead and diseased plants, and concentrating tea tree nutrients are also very beneficial to promoting tea bud germination and increasing yield.

    早采早发多收茶
    中国农业科学院茶叶研究所
    茶叶生产连续两年大跃进，取得了一条重要的丰产经验：“早开采、晚封园”。我国有些茶区自然条件相仿，但由于开采和封园时间不一，因此产量和质量也有高低。如杭州茶区采摘期长达二百四十天，单位产量连年跃进，而气候条件相似的安徽祁门茶区，几年来产量也有提高，但由于采摘期短，增产幅度就低于杭州。事实证明，延长采摘期，是使茶叶生产更大跃进的一个重要关键。
    但是，有人认为不能提早开采。他们的理由是：第一，茶树要在日平均温度摄氏十度以上才能生长发芽；早采气温低，长不出芽来；第二，早采，芽小、产量低，不合算，而且又影响茶树生长发育。究竟能不能提早开采呢？我们的答复是肯定的。当然茶树发芽是需要一定温度的，但温度只是促使茶树发芽综合因子中的一个，在这个条件以外还需要水分、营养等等。同时，当我们把施肥培育等管理工作做好了，温度也是可以在一定程度上随着人们的主观能动性发挥的程度而有所变化。其次，茶树是采叶作物，再生能力很强，早采就能早发。第三，早采的好处很多，不是“不合算”而是很合算。早采既能增加产量，又能提高品质，还能调节劳动力。因为采得早发得早，能增加采摘次数，产量高；早采“明前”茶，采摘时间长，质量好，高级茶多；提早采摘可以更合理地安排劳动力，减少农业生产劳力过分集中的现象。以为不可能早采，是没有根据的。
    早采早发，产量高，质量好的事实是很多的。如杭州市西湖人民公社十月生产队，1956年4月12日开采，亩产干茶一百五十一斤；1957年比前一年提前五天于4月7日开采，亩产干茶一百七十一斤；大跃进的1958年，由于冬季加强了盖草防冻，早春熏烟防霜，提早施肥等措施，采茶期又比1957年提前九天，亩产干茶二百三十六斤；1959年在1958年大跃进的基础上，由于措施更有力，采摘期又比1958年提早八天，于3月21日开采，亩产干茶三百二十斤。该队由于掌握了茶树早采早发的特性，并加强了肥培管理措施，不但产量年年跃进，高级茶也年年增加。
    提早开采，并不是像那些人所讲的，没到采摘的标准就去采小芽小叶。我们说提早开采是采取积极措施，促使茶芽早萌发，在芽叶长到采摘标准时（龙井茶为一芽一叶）开采。当然，要使茶树早萌发，早开采，除了解放思想、打破陈规以外，还要千方百计采取有效的技术措施。根据各地先进经验，要早采早发，当前必须狠抓这样几个措施：
    第一、堆草熏烟，战胜晚霜。茶树进入“休眠”以后，由于受了长期低温锻炼，树体内部细胞起了一系列生物化学变化，积累了一定的自卫物质（糖分及其它可溶性物质），增强了抗寒力。但当春季气温逐渐上升，解除“休眠”，开始萌芽以后，体内充满了大量水分，细胞内物质趋向合成，其可溶性物质含量减少，自卫力量就会显著下降；这时一旦遇到寒冷侵袭，就造成嫩芽焦枯，生机停滞。特别是江南茶区，2—3月气温极不稳定，常有寒潮和晚霜出现，更要重视防霜防寒工作。
    第二、早施肥，多施热性肥。茶树发芽迟早与茶树所得营养物质多少，有很大关系。目前一般茶树施肥量少，营养不足，抗寒力差；树势衰老的植株，如营养不足，更容易遭受冻害，而且发芽也迟。因此，早施春肥，使春前茶树生长健壮，对增强茶树抗寒能力，提早发芽，具有很重要的意义。因为早春茶芽未萌动以前，根系首先活动，早施春肥可使根系充分吸收营养物质，为萌芽奠定物质基础。
    开春以后，气温增至摄氏五度以上，茶芽就开始生长，以后随着气温逐日上升，就迅速萌芽抽叶。此时茶树除要求一定的温度以外，还需大量水分和养料，因此再追施一次催芽肥进行催芽提蕻是非常必要的。
    第三、大量喷水肥，增加茶树营养。茶树根外追肥是大跃进中创造的一种用肥少、收效大的施肥方法。特别是在初春地温较低根部吸肥力不很强的情况下，根外追肥可以发挥更大的作用。茶树叶面直接吸收营养物质可比根部吸收减少物质运输过程，能直接在叶子内部通过新陈代谢作用，形成茶树组成物质，更能促进茶芽早发，快长。
    此外，提早春耕，增加土壤蓄水量，剪去枯老病株，集中茶树养分，对促进茶芽萌发和提高产量也有很大好处。
