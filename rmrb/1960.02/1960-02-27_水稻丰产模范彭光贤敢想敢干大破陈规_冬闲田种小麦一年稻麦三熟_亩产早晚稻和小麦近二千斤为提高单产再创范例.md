(Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, February 26th) Peng Guangxian, a nationally renowned rice production model, has successfully experimented with three harvests a year of wheat and rice. Last year, his experimental fields yielded nearly 2,000 jin per mu of early rice, late rice, and wheat, providing a good example for saving land and increasing yield per unit area. Recently, Peng Guangxian has been hired as a researcher at the Jiangxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Currently, the wheat sown in his experimental fields is more than two chi tall and growing well, and the area of the experimental fields has been expanded from 6.6 mu last year to 45 mu.

Peng Guangxian is the Party Branch Secretary of Xincun Brigade, Xiangdong People's Commune, Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province. He began experimenting with three rice and wheat harvests a year in the winter of 1958. Last year, his three-harvest experimental fields yielded 268 jin of wheat per mu, more than double that of dry land wheat; and a total of 1,703 jin of early and late rice, also higher than the yield per mu of the brigade's double-cropping rice fields. Moreover, rice paddies that have been planted with wheat benefit from deep plowing, fine harrowing, weeding, and fertilizing during the winter, as well as exposure to sunlight, frost, and weathering. The bottom of the field does not become compacted, the topsoil has less cold mud, and many pests are also frozen to death. Therefore, using winter fallow paddy fields for crop rotation with wheat, rapeseed, and green manure can not only increase grain production, but also improve soil and eliminate pests.

Peng Guangxian's experiment was successful under the guidance of the spirit of continuous revolution and continuous leaps forward. After his production brigade basically solved the problem of water conservancy in 1956, they realized double-cropping of rice paddies. In 1958, the average yield per mu of double-cropping rice in the brigade reached more than 1,300 jin. On this basis, Peng Guangxian began experimenting with three rice harvests a year. However, because the early rice was transplanted too early, it was difficult to manage and many seedlings rotted; and the late rice was transplanted too late, and some of it failed to head due to the cold weather. Although all three crops were harvested, the yields were lower than that of two crops.

Peng Guangxian was not discouraged by the failure of the three-rice-harvests-a-year experiment. After repeatedly seeking advice from teachers and friends and conducting in-depth investigations and research, he started a three-harvests-a-year rice-wheat experiment in paddy fields in the winter of 1958.

At this time, they faced a difficult problem: early rice transplanting had to be carried out 20 to 30 days before the wheat harvest, so they could not wait until after the wheat was harvested to transplant; the growing habits of wheat and rice were different, and intercropping of rice and wheat was not possible. What to do? Peng Guangxian and the masses discussed together and finally came up with a "nursery transplanting" method to solve the problem of wheat and early rice competing for land. "Nursery transplanting" means transplanting the seedlings prepared for transplanting in the wheat field into a rice field first, and then moving them to the wheat field after the wheat is harvested.

The "nursery transplanting" method broke through the first hurdle, but after the wheat harvest, the early rice had generally already tillered well and taken shape, and was in an important stage of growth. Pulling it up and transplanting it again would be very unfavorable to the growth of the early rice; the rice seedlings might even wither, prolonging the maturity period and affecting yield. In order to ensure the normal growth of early rice during transplanting, Peng Guangxian chose the "nursery transplanting" fields around the wheat fields, transplanting them as they were pulled up, ensuring that the "nursery transplanting" did not leave the soil for more than an hour. In addition, a large amount of pig and cow manure was applied as base fertilizer in the wheat field before transplanting, and fertilizer powder was applied as top dressing after transplanting to ensure that the rice seedlings received abundant nutrition. Peng Guangxian also chose to transplant after 3:00 pm to avoid the rice seedlings being exposed to the sun; immediately after transplanting, the field was irrigated to a depth of three or four cun to protect the roots of the seedlings.

Because Peng Guangxian was not afraid of difficulties and tried every means to overcome them, the early rice in the wheat stubble grew very well, the maturity period was not prolonged, and the timely transplanting of late rice was ensured, resulting in a bumper harvest of late rice as well.

### 水稻丰产模范彭光贤敢想敢干大破陈规  冬闲田种小麦一年稻麦三熟  亩产早晚稻和小麦近二千斤为提高单产再创范例

    水稻丰产模范彭光贤敢想敢干大破陈规
    冬闲田种小麦一年稻麦三熟
    亩产早晚稻和小麦近二千斤为提高单产再创范例
    据新华社南昌26日电　全国著名水稻丰产模范彭光贤试种小麦、水稻一年三熟成功。去年他所种的试验田里，每亩产早晚稻和麦子近两千斤，为节约用地提高单位面积产量提供了良好范例。最近，彭光贤已被聘为中国科学院江西分院研究员。现在，他的试验田里播种的小麦高达两尺以上，长得很好，试验田面积已由去年的六亩六分扩大到四十五亩。
    彭光贤是江西萍乡县湘东人民公社新村大队党支部书记，前年冬天开始作稻麦三熟试验。去年，他的三熟试验田里每亩亩产小麦二百六十八斤，比旱地小麦高一倍多；产早晚两季水稻共一千七百零三斤，也比全队双季稻田的亩产量高。而且，种过小麦的稻田，由于在冬季经过深耕、细耙、除草、施肥，又饱受日晒、霜冻、风化，田底不结板，表土少冷浆，害虫也多被冻死。因此，利用冬闲水田轮种小麦、油菜、绿肥，不仅可以增产粮食，还具有改良土壤、消灭害虫的作用。
    彭光贤的试验是在不断革命、不断跃进的思想指导下获得成功的。他所在的生产大队在1956年基本解决水利问题以后，就实现了稻田双季化。1958年，全队双季水稻亩产平均达一千三百多斤。在这个基础上，彭光贤开始了水稻年收三季的试验。但是，因为早稻插秧太早，不易管理，烂秧较多；晚稻插秧太晚，部分晚稻由于天气转冷抽不出穗。三季水稻虽然都有了收成，收获量却比两季稻低。
    水稻一年三熟试验失败了，彭光贤并不灰心。在多次寻师访友和深入调查研究后，1958年冬天，又在水田里搞起稻麦三熟试验。
    这时，他们面临着一个难题：早稻插秧要在小麦收割前二三十天进行，因此决不能等待割麦以后再插秧；小麦、水稻生长习性不同，也不能实行稻麦间作。怎么办？彭光贤和群众一同讨论，最后终于想出用“寄秧”的办法来解决小麦和早稻争田问题。“寄秧”，就是把准备插在麦田里的秧苗先插在稻田里，等到割麦后再移到麦田。
    “寄秧”的办法把第一道难关冲破了，可是麦收后，早稻一般都已分蘖好，定了型，正是生长中的重要阶段，再拔起来移栽，对早稻生长很不利；甚至稻秧枯萎，延长成熟期，影响产量。为了保证早稻在移栽中正常生长，彭光贤把“寄秧”田选择在麦田周围，边拔边栽，拔完栽完，使“寄秧”离土不超过一个钟头。此外，移栽前先在麦田里施下大量猪牛粪做底肥，移栽后又施肥田粉作追肥，保证稻秧获得丰富营养。彭光贤还选择了下午三点钟以后为移栽时间，避免稻秧被晒；移栽后即灌水三四寸深，保护秧根。
    由于彭光贤不害怕困难，并且想方设法克服困难，结果麦茬早稻生长很好，成熟期也没有延长，又保证了晚稻适时插秧，使晚稻也获得大丰收。
