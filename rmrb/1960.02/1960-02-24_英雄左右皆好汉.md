    A Hero is Surrounded by Good Men
    Wang Pu
    Chen Xingfu, a milling worker at the Chongqing Chang’an Machine Factory, is truly an advanced red banner bearer. In a little over a year, he directly helped 120 people become heroes of technological innovation and revolution, indirectly helped 427 people become active fighters of technological innovation and revolution, and helped more than 30 people enter the ranks of advanced producers. Chen Xingfu has truly played the leading, backbone, and bridging role of an advanced producer.
    The reason Chen Xingfu is advanced is because he consciously realizes that his labor is not for himself, nor for his close or distant relatives, but for our great motherland, for the most sublime and magnificent cause of mankind—the cause of communism. "The cause of communism is very great, it is a collective cause, and it cannot be completed by a few people alone." This is Chen Xingfu's thinking. Thought guides action. With the lofty communist ideology, Chen Xingfu produced lofty communist actions. When he himself had excellently completed the state plan for three and a half consecutive years, produced no defective products for six years, did not draw tools for four years, and insisted on multi-machine management for six years, when he had already become an advanced producer, he did not think that he had done well enough, that he had fulfilled his responsibilities. "It is better for a hundred people to increase production by one-fold than for one person to increase production ten-fold." He felt that there was still much, much more work to be done. He wanted to care about the collective, and he wanted to help the people around him complete the state plan as excellently as he did, produce no defective products as excellently as he did, not draw tools for several years as excellently as he did, and insist on multi-machine management as excellently as he did. He wanted to turn the people around him into advanced producers, into heroes in production.
    The reason Chen Xingfu is advanced is because he knows that if a person wants to change from backward to advanced, from not completing the plan very well to completing the plan very well, learning and mastering advanced technology is very important. However, the proletariat’s political leadership and the leadership of advanced thought are even more important. Chairman Mao said that ideology and politics are the commander and soul of all work. To revolutionize backward technology, we must first revolutionize backward ideology. If backward ideology is revolutionized, and the proletariat's politics and advanced ideology are in command, people will proactively learn new technologies and new experiences, and will actively create new technologies and new experiences. Chen Xingfu understands this principle, so he not only tells others his new technologies and new experiences without reservation, and not only teaches others to learn this or that specific experience, but more importantly, first helps the people around him to improve their thinking and their awareness. In order to turn people who love to play and have fun into people who love technological innovation and revolution, in order to turn people who have feelings of inferiority and low confidence into fighters of technological innovation and revolution who dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, in order to turn unconscious socialist builders into conscious communist fighters, he is not afraid of hard nails, not afraid of soft nails, works hard and without complaint, and tries every means to make friends with young lads and actively helps and encourages veteran workers. He constantly influences others with his actions, so that others consciously become advanced producers. A single spark can start a prairie fire. Sure enough, one Chen Xingfu became dozens, hundreds of "Chen Xingfus," one red flower became dozens, hundreds of red flowers. "A hero is surrounded by good men," Chen Xingfu is worthy of this saying.
    The Mao Zedong era is an era in which communist ideology is unprecedentedly prosperous and the communist style is greatly promoted. On all fronts, there are already many people like Chen Xingfu who have a lofty communist style, but we still need more such figures. If we can increase the number of such figures as Chen Xingfu by 100,000, then in one year, we will increase the number of technological innovation and revolution experts by more than 10 million, and more than 3 million workers will change from backward to advanced. "When the masses are advanced, they can move mountains and overturn seas." With so many technological innovation and revolution experts, and with such a large advanced producer force, relying on them to unite and help the people around them like Chen Xingfu, what mountains cannot be moved? What seas cannot be overturned?

    英雄左右皆好汉
    王朴
    重庆长安机器厂铣工陈兴富，真是个先进的红旗手。在一年多时间里，他直接帮助了一百二十个人成为技术革新和技术革命的好汉，间接帮助了四百二十七人成为技术革新和技术革命的积极战士，帮助了三十多人进入先进生产者行列。陈兴富真正发挥了先进生产者的带头、骨干和桥梁作用。
    陈兴富之所以先进，是因为他自觉到自己的劳动，不是为自己，也不是为自己的近亲和远邻，而是为我们伟大的祖国，为人类最崇高、最瑰丽的事业——共产主义事业。“共产主义事业伟大得很，是集体的事业，依靠少数人是不能完成的。”这就是陈兴富的想法。思想指导行动。陈兴富有了崇高的共产主义思想，就产生了崇高的共产主义行动。当他自己连续三年半出色地完成国家计划、六年不出废品、四年不领刀具、六年坚持多机床管理的时候，当他已经成为先进生产者的时候，他并不认为自己已经做得不错了，已经尽到自己的责任了。“一个人提高生产十倍，不如一百个人提高一倍。”他觉得应该做的工作还很多很多。他要关心集体，要帮助周围的人都跟自己一样出色地完成国家计划，一样出色地不出废品，一样出色地几年不领刀具，一样出色地坚持多机床管理。他要把周围的人都变成先进生产者，变成生产上的好汉。
    陈兴富之所以先进，是因为他知道，一个人要从后进变先进，从不很出色地完成计划到很出色地完成计划，学会和掌握先进技术是很重要的。然而无产阶级的政治挂帅，先进思想挂帅更重要。毛主席说，思想和政治是一切工作的统帅和灵魂。要革落后技术的命，必须先革落后思想的命。落后的思想革掉了，无产阶级政治和先进思想挂帅了，人就会主动地学习新技术和新经验，就会积极地创造新技术和新经验。陈兴富懂得这个道理，所以他不仅仅把自己新技术、新经验毫无保留地告诉别人，也不仅仅教会别人学会这一种或那一种具体经验，更重要的是首先帮助周围的人提高思想，提高觉悟。为了把贪玩爱耍的人变成爱技术革新和技术革命的人，为了把有自卑感、信心不高的人，变为敢想敢说敢干的技术革新和技术革命的战士，为了把不自觉的社会主义建设者变为自觉的共产主义战士，不怕碰硬钉子，不怕碰软钉子，任劳任怨，千方百计地跟年青小伙子交朋友，积极帮助和鼓舞老工人。他时刻以自己的行动影响别人，使别人自觉地做一个先进生产者。星星之火，可以燎原。果然，一个陈兴富变成了几十个、几百个“陈兴富”，一朵红花变成了几十朵、几百朵红花。“英雄左右皆好汉”，这句话，陈兴富足以当之。
    毛泽东时代，是共产主义思想空前兴盛、共产主义风格大发扬的时代。在各个战线上，像陈兴富这样具有祟高的共产主义风格的人已经不少，但是我们还要更多的这样的人物。如果我们能增加十万个陈兴富这样的人物，那么在一年里，我们就会增加一千多万个技术革新和技术革命的能手，就会有三百多万个工人从后进变为先进。“众人先进，移山倒海”，有了这么多的技术革新和技术革命能手，有了这么大的先进生产者队伍，依靠他们像陈兴富一样团结和帮助周围的人，还有什么山不能移？还有什么海不能倒？
