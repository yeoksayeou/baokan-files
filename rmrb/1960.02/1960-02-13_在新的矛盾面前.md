    Facing New Contradictions
    Chen Zhiyan
    Contradictions, once resolved, are inevitably followed by new ones. This is the law of the development of things. The news published in today's newspaper about the auxiliary workshops of the Harbin Electric Machinery Factory vigorously engaging in technological innovation once again proves this truth.
    The tide of technological innovation in this factory is sweeping through every corner of the enterprise. Its grand scale, depth, and rapid pace are unprecedented. In just two months, the level of mechanization in the factory's auxiliary workshops increased from 55% to 68%. In one boiler workshop, after the automation of coal transportation was implemented, the required labor force was reduced by four-fifths. This shows that the new productive forces unleashed by the technological innovation movement are like a surging torrent, rapidly advancing the level of production to a new height.
    However, after the old technical contradictions hindering the development of productive forces were resolved, new contradictions immediately emerged.
    On the front lines of technological innovation, one team opened a gap, advanced rapidly along the breakthrough, and increased productivity several times over. But other teams remained in their original positions. This is the new contradiction. The finishing workshops of the Harbin Electric Machinery Factory originally had a relatively high degree of mechanization. During the technological innovation movement, they also carried out many innovations first, and their productivity developed rapidly. However, the manual operations in its auxiliary workshops before, after, and to the sides still accounted for a large proportion, which put production in an unstable state where the various links were not adapted to each other.
    How should we deal with this new contradiction? There are two viewpoints and two attitudes.
    One is a passive viewpoint and a passive attitude. In the Harbin Electric Machinery Factory, some people once held the view that "manual operations in auxiliary workshops are unavoidable" and "the quality of manual operations is better than mechanization." If we were to act according to this conservative view, we would have to withdraw the advanced troops and reduce the productivity that had already been increased. In a word, let the advanced accommodate the backward.
    The other is an active viewpoint and an active attitude: let the auxiliary workshops also break through and actively establish a new balance. This is exactly what the Harbin Electric Machinery Factory did. They seized this new contradiction and carried out large-scale technological innovation in the auxiliary workshops, achieving an overall leap forward and universally raising the factory's level of productivity to a new high point. Here, the decisive factor is the subjective initiative of people. Using a metaphysical viewpoint, only paying attention to mechanical balance and proportion, failing to give play to subjective initiative, and succumbing to long-established production methods will inevitably delay the speed of development of productive forces. Using a dialectical materialist viewpoint, not being intimidated by new contradictions, fully giving play to people's subjective initiative, and declaring war on habitual old methods can enable the backward to catch up with the advanced and greatly accelerate the speed of development of productive forces.
    The more bravely and resolutely the technological innovation and technological revolution movement develops, the more new contradictions will be gradually exposed, which is also inevitable and normal. For example, due to the new and enormous productive forces generated in technological innovation, some places are now feeling that raw materials, fuel, electricity, etc., cannot keep up with demand. This is another new contradiction. However, this is a gratifying phenomenon, indicating that our productive forces are advancing at a leaping speed. The problem is that we must recognize this contradiction, grasp the laws of the development of contradictions, and adopt active guidelines and measures to establish a new balance on a new basis.
    Marxists have always believed that things develop in the struggle of contradictions. Contradictions are also the driving force of development in socialist society. Therefore, we must use the thought of continuous revolution to handle contradictions and promote socialist construction. This is the correct attitude we should adopt in the face of new contradictions.

    在新的矛盾面前
    陈之衍
    矛盾，解决了一个，又会有新的矛盾出现，这是事物发展的规律。今天本报发表的哈尔滨电机厂辅助车间大闹技术革新的消息，再一次证明了这一真理。
    这一个厂子技术革新的浪潮，正在冲击着企业的每个角落。它的宏大的规模、深入的程度和迅速的步伐，是前所未见的。仅仅两个月时间，这个厂的辅助车间机械化的程度，就从55％提高到68％。一个锅炉车间，实现输煤自动化后，需要的劳动力已减少了五分之四。由此可见，从技术革新运动中所迸发出来的新的生产力，有如一道奔放的巨流，高速度地把生产水平推进到一个新的高度。
    但是，影响生产力发展的旧的技术矛盾解决后，马上又出现了新的矛盾。
    在技术革新战线上，一支队伍打开了缺口，沿着突破口神速地前进，成倍地提高了生产力。可是其它的队伍还留在原有的阵地上。这就是新的矛盾。哈尔滨电机厂的成品车间，原来机械化的程度就比较高，技术革新运动中它又首先进行了好多项革新，生产力发展得很快。可是它前后左右的辅助车间的手工操作，却仍然占很大比重，这就使生产处在各个环节不相适应的不稳定状态中。
    怎样对待这个新的矛盾？有两种观点和两种态度。
    一种是消极的观点、消极的态度。在哈尔滨电机厂就曾经有人有这样的看法：“辅助车间的手工操作是免不了的”，“手工操作比机械化的质量要好”。如果按照这种守旧的看法去做，只好把前进了的部队撤回来，把已经提高了的生产力降下去。一句话，让先进迁就落后。
    另一种是积极的观点、积极的态度：让辅助车间也突上去，积极地建立新的平衡。哈尔滨电机厂正是这样做的。他们捉住了这个新的矛盾，在辅助车间大搞技术革新，取得了全面跃进，使全厂的生产力水平普遍达到了一个新的高点。在这里，决定性是人的主观能动作用。用形而上学的观点，只注意机械的平衡和比例，不发挥主观能动作用，屈服于早已习惯的生产方法，结果必然会延缓生产力的发展速度。用辩证唯物主义的观点，不被新的矛盾吓倒，充分发挥人的主观能动作用，向习惯了的旧方法开战，就能使落后的赶上先进，大大加快生产力的发展速度。
    技术革新和技术革命运动越是勇往直前地发展，新的矛盾将逐渐地暴露出来，这也是必然的和正常的。比如，由于技术革新中产生了新的巨大的生产力，现在有些地方已经感觉到原材料、燃料、电力等赶不上需要。这又是一种新的矛盾。然而这却是一种可喜的现象，说明了我们的生产力正在以一种飞跃的速度前进。问题在于我们要认识这种矛盾，掌握矛盾发展的规律，采取积极的方针和措施，在新的基础上，建立新的平衡。
    马克思主义者从来认为：事物是在矛盾的斗争中发展的。矛盾也是社会主义社会发展的动力。因此，我们必须用不断革命的思想来处理矛盾，推进社会主义建设。这就是我们在新的矛盾面前所应当采取的正确态度。
