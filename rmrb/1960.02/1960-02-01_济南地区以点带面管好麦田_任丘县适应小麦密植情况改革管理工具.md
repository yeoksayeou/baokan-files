Xinhua News Agency report:

    Jinan area in Shandong province is strengthening wheat field management by adopting the method of using high-yield fields to drive the general improvement of other fields. The area has conscientiously implemented the policy of "planting more to harvest more" and simultaneously pursuing large-area high-yield bumper harvests. The high-yield wheat fields cultivated account for 61% of the total wheat planting area.

    In the Jinan area, each county and commune has established a wheat high-yield field headquarters led by the Party committee secretary. In terms of field management, they have adopted "four priorities" (priority for irrigation, topdressing, labor arrangement, and water conservancy construction), "five going to the fields" (leading cadres going to the fields, pig pens going to the fields, local fertilizer plants going to the fields, yield targets going to the fields, and management measures going to the fields), and "two establishments" (establishing specialized wheat field management teams and a field management record system). Since the beginning of last winter, the Party committees of various counties and communes have transferred more than 300,000 laborers to form more than 8,500 specialized wheat field management teams. Over the past two months, more than 2,000 pig farms and more than 800 local fertilizer plants and granular fertilizer plants have been established in high-yield fields. A wheat field record management system has been established. The method of "three combinations" of cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers has been adopted to establish more than 110 technical management research committees or research groups. All high-yield fields were universally irrigated and fertilized once before freezing, and a cover fertilizer was universally applied once in mid-winter. The average amount of fertilizer applied in the two topdressings reached more than 8,000 jin per mu. The third topdressing is currently underway.

    The establishment of high-yield blocks has greatly promoted field management of general wheat fields. The Jinan area counties, communes, and teams have held more than 500 on-site wheat field management meetings, proposing the slogan of learning from high-yield blocks in all measures, so that high-yield fields drive general fields. At present, the first topdressing of all wheat fields in the communes has been basically completed.

    Xinhua News Agency report: Renqiu County, Hebei Province, is reforming wheat management tools in various communes, accelerating the progress of management and improving the efficiency and quality of management work.

    In Renqiu County, 80% of wheat is densely planted, and many of the original tools are no longer suitable. In order to achieve a bumper wheat harvest, management work requires perfection, and labor feels insufficient. The county party committee timely proposed the call for carrying out tool reform. By mid-January, various localities had put forward 325 innovation projects and remodeled and created 15 types of special tools, 18,720 pieces, such as manure spreaders, dense planting weeding hoes, liquid fertilizer irrigation carts, and ridged field harrows. These tools all have the characteristics of being made from local materials, simple to manufacture, low cost, high efficiency, suitable for dense planting, and suitable for ridge field management, and the efficiency is generally increased by one or two times, or even more than fifteen times, compared with the old tools.

    Renqiu County has also strengthened the maintenance and repair of machinery. The county party committee has twice organized personnel to bring tools and parts to the countryside to inspect and repair drainage and irrigation machinery, preparing for the timely irrigation of wheat for its greening water.

    济南地区以点带面管好麦田
    任丘县适应小麦密植情况改革管理工具
    据新华社讯　山东济南地区采取丰产田带动一般田的办法，加强麦田管理。这个地区认真贯彻了广种多收和大面积高产丰收同时并举的方针，培育的小麦大面积丰产田，占小麦总播种面积的61％。
    济南地区各县社都由党委书记挂帅成立了小麦丰产田指挥部，在田间管理上采取了“四优先”（优先浇水、追肥、安排劳力、进行水利建设）、“五到田”（领导干部到田、养猪栏圈到田、土化肥厂到田、产量指标到田和管理措施到田）、“两建立”（建立麦田管理专业队和田间管理档案制度）等措施，使这些田既是丰产田又是指挥田。去年入冬以来，各县社党委就抽调三十多万劳力组成八千五百多个麦田管理专业队，两个多月来共在丰产田中建立了养猪场两千多处，土化肥厂和颗粒肥料厂八百多处，建立了麦田档案管理制度，并且采取干部、技术员和老农“三结合”的办法，建立了技术管理研究委员会或研究小组一百一十多个。在封冻前对丰产田普遍浇了一次水，追了一次肥，进入深冬后又普遍追施了一次盖苗肥，两次追肥平均每亩达到八千余斤，目前正进行第三次追肥。
    丰产方的建立大大促进了一般小麦田的田间管理工作。济南地区县社队各级先后召开了五百多次麦田管理现场会议，提出一切措施向丰产方看齐的号召，使丰产田带动了一般田。目前各人民公社所有麦田第一遍追肥已基本完成。
    据新华社讯　河北任丘县各公社改革小麦管理工具，加快了管理进度，提高了管理工效和质量。
    任丘县80％的小麦实行了密植，原有的许多工具已不相适应；为了实现小麦丰收，管理工作要求精益求精，劳力感到不足。县委就及时提出了开展工具改革的号召。到1月中旬，各地已经提出革新课题三百二十五条，改制、创制成撒粪车、密植耘锄、浇稀车、畦田钉耙等专用工具十五种、一万八千七百二十件。这些工具都具有就地取材、制造简便、成本低、工效高、适合密植、适合畦田管理情况等特点，效率一般比旧式工具提高一、两倍甚至十五倍以上。
    任丘县还加强了机具的维护、修理工作。县委曾两次组织人员带工具、零件下乡，巡回检修排、灌机具，为及时浇好小麦返青水做好了准备。
