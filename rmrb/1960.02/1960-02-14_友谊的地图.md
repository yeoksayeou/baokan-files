    A Map of Friendship
    By Soviet Writer Mikhailov

    When we talk about the great friendship between the Soviet and Chinese nations, as a writer and geographer, I see an extraordinarily magnificent picture drawn on the map by our two brotherly nations.

    I have written some books about how socialist construction has changed the geography of the Soviet Union and its appearance. Later, I became interested in the same process occurring in China. To see it with my own eyes, I visited China twice, once in 1951 and again in 1959. My visits to the new China left a very deep impression on me.

    I saw that although our two countries have various differences and their own characteristics, they share a common ground stemming from the foundation of socialism. In both our countries, industry is growing in every region. Industry has even appeared in some areas that were barren and desolate in the past.

    Both the Soviet Union and China have astonished the world with the rapid pace and enormous scale of their industrial and cultural development. These are happening in the depths of Asia, which was once forgotten but is now extremely rich.

    In our Soviet Union, oil flows from between the Volga and the Urals eastward, and has even begun to flow towards Siberia. In China, within a short period, many oil towers have been built in the northwestern region, in the Qaidam Basin and the Junggar Basin, the furthest place from the sea on earth.

    In our East—Kazakhstan and Central Asia—we have awakened non-ferrous metals, while the Chinese people are mining them in the southwestern region, in Yunnan Province. Our ferrous metallurgical industry is striding eastward with the iron and steel furnaces of the Urals-Kuzbass region, and has already reached the Yenisei River. In China, the metallurgical industry has extended to Baotou.

    How much similarity there is in the plans for the reconstruction of the Amu Darya and the Yellow River, these two Asian rivers! The construction of millions of kilowatts of hydroelectric power stations at Sanmenxia and Liujiaxia, the regeneration of the Grand Canal, the expansion of irrigation areas... Although the rivers are different and the climate is not the same, this is familiar and dear to us Soviet people.

    In the past, I learned about these achievements of the Chinese people from newspapers, books, and novels. But now I have traveled across China, from Beijing to Shanghai and Guangdong, from Beijing to Urumqi, and I have seen all this with my own eyes. I am overjoyed by the achievements of the People's China.

    友谊的地图
    苏联作家　米哈依洛夫
    当我们谈到苏联和中国两大民族伟大友谊的时候，作为作家同时又是地理学家的我，就看见了我们两大兄弟民族在地图上描绘出来的一幅异常壮阔的图景。
    我写了一些关于社会主义建设改变苏联地理，改变我国面貌的书籍。后来，我曾对中国发生的同样过程产生了兴趣，为了能亲眼得见，我曾两次访问过中国，一次在1951年，另一次在1959年。对新中国的访问给了我极深刻的印象。
    我看到我们两国尽管有各种不同的地方，尽管有各自的特点，但是由社会主义的基础产生了一种共同的东西。在我们两国，每一个地区都有工业在成长。即使是在一些过去荒芜不毛的地区也出现了工业。
    无论苏联，无论中国，都是以其工业和文化的飞快的发展速度和巨大规模震惊了全世界。这些是发生在不久以前曾被忘掉的，但极其富饶的亚洲深处。
    在我们苏联，石油从伏尔加和乌拉尔之间奔流而出，向着东方流去，并且已经开始向西伯利亚流去；中国人在很短年代里在西北部地区，在柴达木盆地和地球上距离海最远的准噶尔盆地，建起了许多石油塔。
    我们在东方——哈萨克斯坦和中亚一带唤醒了有色金属，而中国人民在西南地区，在云南省把它们开采出来。我们的黑色冶金工业以乌拉尔—库兹巴斯的炼铁炉和炼钢炉向东方阔步迈进，而且已经冲向了叶尼塞河。在中国，冶金工业已伸延到包头。
    阿姆河和黄河这两条亚洲河流的改建计划方面，有多少相同的啊！三门峡和刘家峡的数百万瓩的水电站的建设工程，伟大的运河的再生，灌溉面积的扩大……虽然河流不同，气候不一样，但是这对于我们苏联人民是熟悉的和亲切的。
    关于中国人民的这些成就，过去我是从报纸、书籍和小说里知道的。可是现在我横穿过了中国，从北京到上海和广东，从北京到乌鲁木齐，这一切我都亲眼看到了。我为人民中国的成就而欢欣鼓舞。
