Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, February 2nd: While actively preparing for spring plowing, Guangxi is also starting to train technical personnel for manufacturing and operating rice transplanters, mobilizing the masses to prepare and contribute materials, and rushing to produce a large number of rice transplanters. The Yulin and Liuzhou regions have already produced more than 6,000 rice transplanters, and the Nanning and Baise regions have decided to manufacture more than 90,000 in the first quarter.

The rice transplanters manufactured and promoted this year include the "5913 type," "Liuzhou No. 32," and "Jiangxi 59 type." These rice transplanters have been repeatedly tested and improved many times, and finally, after evaluation and appraisal, have proven to have good performance. Their characteristics are: easy to manufacture, material-saving, simple to operate, and the efficiency is two to three times higher than manual transplanting, or even ten times higher. The row spacing is more uniform and neater than manual transplanting.

Party committees at all levels attach great importance to the manufacture and promotion of rice transplanters, strengthening leadership at all levels, and treating it as an important measure in preparing for farming. County agricultural machinery factories in Guilin, Liuzhou, Yulin, and other regions are manufacturing rice transplanters in large quantities and training technical workers for communes. Guanyang County has established nine rice transplanter technology teaching stations to widely teach manufacturing technology. These teaching stations have trained the first batch of 154 technical workers. Pingnan County held a county-wide rice transplanter training class, with communes sending people to the county to learn, while learning, visiting, and producing. More than 500 people in the county have participated in the manufacture of rice transplanters. The communes and brigades of Pingnan County have also cultivated 256 mu of seedlings for trial transplanting with rice transplanters. During the trial transplanting, on-site meetings were held to make the masses aware of the role of using rice transplanters, thereby laying a good ideological and technical foundation for the large-scale promotion of rice transplanters during spring planting.

Guangxi is one of the rice-producing areas in the country. Every year, transplanting rice takes up a lot of manpower. Large-scale promotion and use of rice transplanters will not only liberate a large number of laborers but also complete the planting tasks according to the season. The Baise region calculated that if manual transplanting is used throughout the region, each person can transplant 0.5 mu per day, requiring 180,000 people to complete the transplanting on time. If rice transplanters are used, each person can transplant 5 mu per day, requiring only 18,000 people, which can save more than 100,000 laborers.

Changsha, February 3rd: Liling County, Hunan Province, the birthplace of the Liling Simple No. 2 rice transplanter, is actively preparing for the promotion and use of rice transplanters, striving to use rice transplanters for all paddy fields this year. The county needs 25,000 units, and 2,850 units have been manufactured so far.

The Liling Simple No. 2 rice transplanter was invented by Communist Party member He Jisheng. After the National Rice Transplanter Conference and the Hunan Three Tools (rice transplanter, rice threshing machine, and fast rice cutter) evaluation meeting, it has been promoted nationwide and throughout the province. The characteristics of this simple rice transplanter are high efficiency (one person operating, improves efficiency two to four times compared to manual transplanting), good quality (transplants evenly, with consistent depth, basically no hooking of seedlings, no damage to seedlings, no missing clumps), low cost (completely bamboo and wood structure, each unit only needs a little more than two liang of wire nails, easy to obtain materials locally, easy to promote), wide adaptability (light and flexible, can be used in mountainous areas, hilly areas, plain areas, whether large or small fields), and can ensure close planting specifications and reduce labor intensity.

The Liling County Party Committee has great determination, started early, and grasped specifically the promotion and use of rice transplanters. From the county to the production team, the secretaries took the lead at all levels, established rice transplanter promotion leading groups, and equipped them with full-time cadres. The leading group organized by Comrade Ma Zhengkai, the first secretary of the county, has made specific arrangements for specific issues such as promotion plans, training technical forces for manufacturing rice transplanters, and solving raw materials. The county party committee also requires party members to take the lead and cadres to lead, learn to use, repair, and explain. According to this requirement, the county will open a training class with 1,000 party members and grassroots cadres participating to train the backbone force for promotion and use of rice transplanters. At the same time, the county, communes, and brigades will hold training classes at three levels to teach 50,000 people to master the operation method of rice transplanters. The training work will be completed before February 20.

In order to quickly promote this simple rice transplanter, the Liling County Party Committee attaches special importance to the quality of the rice transplanters. In addition to the 1,100 woodworkers' training class held in the county, where they learn while explaining and practicing, so that they can manufacture, repair, use, and explain, they also selected 15 farm tool factories with better equipment and higher technical level to specialize in the task of manufacturing rice transplanters within a certain period. In terms of operating technology, the county promoted the advanced method of "assembly line operation, unified assembly, mutual inspection, and ensuring quality" from the Qingshui River Commune. According to the structure of the rice transplanter, it is divided into seven processes: blanking, making teeth, handles, seedling box frames, seedling boxes, seedling pressing devices, and assembly, to implement assembly line operation. In this way, responsibility is clear, and it is easy to specialize in skilled technology and improve work efficiency.

Specific arrangements have also been made for the raw materials for manufacturing rice transplanters. The county needs about 1,600 cubic meters of wood, which has been basically resolved. The 5,000 to 6,000 Phyllostachys nan bamboo needed were purchased from other counties as early as October last year and have now been shipped back. Some wire nails needed for making rice transplanters are still lacking. They are manufacturing them themselves with nail making machines and preparing to replace them with bamboo nails and earth iron nails.

    及早为春插准备新式工具和技术力量
    广西全面推广插秧机
  　湖南醴陵县力争全部水田都用插秧机插秧
    新华社南宁2日电　广西各地在积极准备春耕生产的同时，正着手培养训练制造和操作插秧机的技术人材，发动群众备料、献料，赶制大批插秧机。玉林、柳州专区已生产出六千多架插秧机，南宁、百色专区决定第一季度制造九万多架。
    今年各地制造与推广的插秧机有“五九一三型”、“柳州三十二号”和“江西五十九型”。这些插秧机都经过反复试验，多次改进，最后经过评比、鉴定，证明性能良好。它们的特点是：易制、省料、操作简便，效率比手插提高两三倍，甚至上十倍。株行距比手插的均匀、整齐。
    各级党委十分重视插秧机的制造推广工作，层层加强领导，把它当作备耕工作中的一项重要措施。桂林、柳州、玉林等地区的县农械厂正大量制造插秧机，并为公社培养技术工人。灌阳县共建立了九个插秧机技术传授站，广泛传授制造技术，这些传授站已培养了第一批一百五十四名技术工人。平南县举办了一个全县性的插秧机训练班，由公社派人到县学习，边学、边参观、边生产。全县已有五百多人参加插秧机的制造工作。平南县各公社大队还培育了二百五十六亩秧苗供插秧机试插，试插时，召开试插现场会，使群众认识到使用插秧机的作用，从而为春插大量推广插秧机打好思想和技术基础。
    广西是全国水稻产区之一。每年插秧所占人力很多，大量推广和使用插秧机插秧，不但能解放大批劳动力，而且能按季节完成种植任务。百色专区算了一笔账，全专区如果用人工插秧，每人每天插零点五亩，需十八万人才能按时插完，若用插秧机，每人一天插五亩，只需一万八千人，一下就能节省出十几万个劳动力。
    本报长沙3日电　醴陵简易二号插秧机的诞生地——湖南省醴陵县，正在积极做好推广使用插秧机的准备工作，力争今年全部水田都用插秧机来插秧。全县需要二万五千部，目前已制好二千八百五十部。
    醴陵简易二号插秧机，是共产党员贺继生创造发明的，经过全国插秧机会议和湖南三件工具（插秧机、打稻机、快速割禾器）评比会议评选，已在全国和全省重点推广。这种简易插秧机的特点是工效高（一人操作，比手工插秧提高工效二倍到四倍）、质量好（插得均匀，深浅一致，基本上不勾秧、不伤秧，不缺蔸）、成本低（完全是竹木结构，每部只要二两多洋钉，便于就地取材，易于推广）、适应性广（轻巧灵便，无论山区、丘陵区、平原地区，无论大丘、小丘，都可以使用），并能保证密植规格和减轻劳动强度。
    中共醴陵县委对推广使用插秧机，决心大，抓得早，抓得具体。从县到生产队层层由书记挂帅，建立了插秧机推广领导小组，配备了专职干部。县以第一书记马征凯同志为首组织的领导小组，已经就推广计划、训练制造插秧机的技术力量、解决原材料等等具体问题，作出了具体安排。县委还要求党员带头、干部领先，学会使用、修理、讲解。按照这个要求，全县将开办有一千名党员和基层干部参加的训练班，培训推广和使用插秧机的骨干力量。同时，全县还由县、公社、大队三级分别举办训练班，教会五万人掌握插秧机的操作方法，训练工作将在2月20日以前完成。
    为了迅速推广这种简易插秧机，醴陵县委对插秧机的质量特别重视，他们除了在县里举办的一千一百多名的木工训练班，实行边讲解边实习，使他们会制造、会修理、会使用、会讲解外，还选择了十五个设备较好、技术水平较高的农具厂，在一定的时期内，专门承担制造插秧机的任务。在操作技术上，全县推广了清水江公社“流水作业，统一装配，互相检查，确保质量”的先进方法，根据插秧机的构造，分成下料、作齿、把手、秧箱架、秧箱、压秧装置、装配等七道工序，实行流水作业。这样，责任分明，又能按特长分工，便于熟练技术，提高工效。
    对制造插秧机的原材料也已作出了具体安排。全县约需一千六百立方米的木材，已基本解决。需要的五、六千根楠竹，早在去年10月就派人到外县采购，目前已全部运回来了。制插秧机所需要的洋钉还缺少一部分，他们一面用制钉机自己制造，一面准备用竹钉和土铁打的钉子代替。
