Responding to the Shijingshan Steel Plant Initiative
    Seizing the Moment to Increase Steel Production
    All Steel Plants in the Capital Launch a New Production Upsurge Overnight

    (Reported by our newspaper) The workers of various steel plants in Beijing enthusiastically responded to the initiative of the workers of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, determined to complete the state steel production plan for the first quarter ahead of schedule and exceeding the target.
    The steelmaking workers of Beijing Special Steel Plant spread the word and expressed their firm determination to respond to the Shijingshan Steel Plant initiative. The factory leadership held a meeting of cadres and activists on the afternoon of the 27th – the day the Shijingshan initiative was announced – and put forward the goal of struggling to complete the first quarter's production plan seven days ahead of schedule and exceeding the quarterly trial production plan for new steel grades. At the same time, it is necessary to extend furnace life, improve quality, reduce iron consumption, and ensure safety in production during the leap forward. In order to achieve this requirement, the factory decided to continue to carry out technological innovation on a large scale, and widely carry out technical performance competitions and production games. At the same time, it is also necessary to seize the production preparations for the second quarter. The workers acted as they spoke, and the workers of Team B exceeded the shift output plan for steel by 26% on the same day.
    All the workers of Beijing Steel Plant also held a mobilization meeting at 6 p.m. on the same day, determined to fight for 33 days and complete the first quarter plan for steel and steel products seven days ahead of schedule, and respond to the Shijingshan initiative with this condition. The No. 2 converter steelmaking workshop originally planned to test a high-quality steel – carbon structural steel – in March. After the meeting, the workers were full of fighting spirit and determined to start trial production immediately. As a result, they successfully smelted the first furnace of carbon structural steel that night, and the quality reached the standard of electric furnace smelting.
    The workers of Xinzhong Steel Plant enthusiastically responded to the Shijingshan Steel Plant initiative. This factory had already completed the first quarter's iron production plan 58 days ahead of schedule. The workers in the ironmaking workshop held another meeting and put forward leap forward targets, striving to overfulfill the state plan by about one time in the first quarter.

    抓紧增产钢铁
    首都各钢厂连夜掀起生产新高潮
    本报讯　北京市各钢铁厂职工热烈响应石景山钢铁公司职工的倡议，决心提前超额完成第一季度国家钢铁生产计划。
    北京特殊钢厂的炼钢工人奔走相告，纷纷表示坚决响应石钢倡议。工厂领导方面在27日——石钢倡议公布的当天下午召开干部和积极分子大会，提出了奋斗目标：提前七天完成第一季度生产计划和超额完成全季新钢种试制计划。同时要延长炉龄，提高质量，降低铁耗，生产跃进保安全。为了达到这一要求，厂里决定继续大搞技术革新，广泛开展技术表演赛和生产运动会。同时还要抓紧第二季度的生产准备工作。职工们说干就干，乙班工人当天就超额26％完成了钢的班产量计划。
    北京钢厂全厂职工也在当天下午六时举行誓师大会，决心大战三十三天，提前七天完成钢和钢材的第一季度计划，以这个条件响应石钢的倡议。第二转炉炼钢车间原计划3月份试验一种优质钢——炭素结构钢，大会以后，职工们斗志昂扬，决心立即动手提前试制。结果在晚上他们就成功地炼出了第一炉炭素结构钢，质量达到了电炉冶炼的标准。
    新中钢铁厂职工热烈响应石钢的倡议。这个厂已经提前五十八天完成了第一季度产铁计划。炼铁车间的职工又开会提出了跃进指标，力争在第一季度超额一倍左右完成国家计划。
