Rapidly Developing Polish Chemical Industry
    Tao Zhong

The chemical industry, a latecomer in Polish industry, has recently developed into a large-scale industrial sector. At present, the output value of this sector is more than twelve times that of pre-war levels, with over seven thousand types of products. In many aspects, it has reached or is about to reach the advanced world level. The Polish Chemical Industry New Product Exhibition held in Warsaw at the beginning of this year fully demonstrated this point. The exhibition featured over five hundred new products belonging to nine chemical joint companies, concentrating on the achievements and development prospects of the Polish chemical industry, leaving a deep impression on visitors.

            All-Powerful Plastics

    The exhibition was rich and colorful. Upon entering the exhibition hall, one could see a transparent plastic motor speedboat, as well as marine compasses, parachute-style signal lights for navigation, automobile dashboards, printed circuit boards, and chemical instruments made of Plexiglas... The guide introduced us to the fact that Poland's shipbuilding and machinery manufacturing industries are constantly expanding the use of plastics to replace non-ferrous metals. This not only overcomes the difficulty of insufficient raw materials but also greatly reduces costs. Moreover, plastics themselves have advantages that metals do not possess. For example, the motor speedboat mentioned earlier is as strong as metal, but because of its light weight, it can be faster. Comrade Grochowski, the person in charge of the exhibition who accompanied us, also pointed to a telephone switchboard wire wrapped in plastic insulating paper and said that plastic electrical materials and insulating materials have excellent performance. This type of wire can handle one thousand simultaneous calls, while ordinary telephone switchboard wires can only handle fifty. In addition, a thin copper sheet with plastic applied according to the circuit, it is said, can be used without copper wire conductors; by simply installing vacuum tubes, etc., it becomes a pocket-sized radio.

    Plastics can not only replace metals but can also be used as substitutes for wood and leather to make various daily necessities. Here we saw a very comfortable leather sofa that did not use a single spring or piece of leather. There were also chairs made of glass rope and plastic, tables with plastic tabletops, and various furniture coated with plastic. This furniture is lightweight, beautiful, bright in color, and shiny, making it very appealing. In addition, there are many types of inexpensive leather goods made of plastic, such as leather bags, leather shoes, etc. A type of plastic leather shoe that resembles suede costs only one-tenth of the price of ordinary leather shoes.

    Wall materials, foam wall panels, floors, screens, curtains, etc., made of plastic have many characteristics such as sound insulation, moisture resistance, heat resistance, cold resistance, and resistance to temperature changes. Plastics have penetrated into all aspects of people's material and cultural life, as demonstrated by the newly produced colorful picture postcards, fine-groove records, colorful movie and photographic film, non-flammable movie film, X-ray film, and pearl celluloid packaging bags.

        New "Rubber Plantation"

    Several years ago, I heard that a large "rubber plantation" was being developed in southern Poland, near the Carpathian Mountains. Everyone knows that tropical rubber trees cannot grow under Poland's temperature conditions. However, the "rubber plantation" here possesses strange rubber tree machines that are not restricted by climatic conditions. By putting coal and lime into them, rubber will grow. At this exhibition, we saw the first batch of products from this "rubber plantation." It is said that this year's output will increase from 5,000 tons last year to 20,000 tons. In this way, it can not only meet Poland's domestic demand for synthetic rubber but also export a portion.

    New rubber products, such as aircraft tires, automobile tires, motorcycle and agricultural machinery tires, and curtain fabrics, are all made of nylon. There are also tubeless bicycle tires, non-combustible mining conveyor belts, pump pistons, chemical filter plates, battery cases, boat water hoses, and rubber boats.

    Medical rubber oxygen bags are easy to move, travel rubber beds, and various children's toys are all available. The audience's admiring gazes were cast on pairs of winter rubber boots, which are not only beautiful in appearance but also have a thick flannel lining inside to keep warm, making them very practical.

        Synthetic Fibers and Dyes

    If nylon fabrics were expensive luxury items in Poland a few years ago, then in recent years, due to the increase in domestic synthetic fiber production, the price of nylon fabrics has fallen accordingly, and it has become increasingly common for women to wear nylon socks and nylon clothes. The exhibition featured a large number of Stilon fabrics, as well as synthetic wool yarn sweaters and other fabrics that were trial-produced last year. The colors of these synthetic fiber fabrics are much prettier than those of natural silk and wool fabrics, and the biggest advantage is that the production speed of this fiber is much faster than that of natural silk and natural wool. The guide informed us that this year Poland's Stilon production will reach 4,500 tons.

    Dyes are essential for beautifying various fabrics. Poland now produces more than 7,000 tons of various dyes annually, with hundreds of varieties. The exhibition featured a total of eighty-nine new dyes from last year, such as naphthol dyes and wood dyes. A dye called "Polokin" is a Polish specialty calico dye with bright colors and wash and acid resistance of level four and five, which can be printed and dyed in steam, surpassing West Germany's "Lapidotkin" dye. There are also emulsion dyes, which are specially used for dyeing synthetic fibers.

    Serving Agriculture and Healthcare

    While visiting the pesticide section, Grochowski introduced to us that pesticides are playing an increasingly important role in the Polish chemical industry. Poland is a country that produces a lot of rye, potatoes, and sugar beets. In recent years, potatoes and sugar beets have suffered from continuous insect pests, and the demand for pesticides has therefore increased greatly. For this reason, the chemical industry is vigorously developing production in this area. Twelve new pesticides were produced last year, with significant insecticidal effects and a relatively large increase in production. It is planned to increase production by 41% this year.

    He continued, saying that pesticides are medicines for crops, while fertilizers are their nutrients. Both are important factors in improving agricultural production. Although various fertilizers were not exhibited here because they are not new products, Poland has also achieved great success in developing fertilizers. Last year, fertilizer production increased by 13%, and this year, phosphate and nitrogen fertilizers will reach 207,000 tons and 244,000 tons, respectively.

    Subsequently, we visited sixty-two new products in the pharmaceutical field, including six new antibiotics, polio vaccines, "Pradnisone" for treating rheumatism, "Avelmarine" tablets to prevent seasickness or airsickness, etc. The markers on the wall indicated that these drugs were almost entirely imported in the past.

    Interesting Paints, Glues, and Fuels

    After seeing Poland's newly produced engine oil, cylinder oil, transformer and drilling machine oil, and other industrial oils and various marine paints, aircraft, automobile, and machine paints, Comrade Grochowski led us to see several interesting products. A paint called "Nitro Polytura," dissolved in alcohol and applied to furniture, will make the furniture very shiny while retaining the original color and grain of the wood. Castings are first coated with organic glue putty to make the surface smooth, and then sprayed with a paint called "Heimal Shlak," which will give them exceptional gloss. "Butapren" paint and "Butalast" glue can turn waste leather into useful leather. Melamine glue and urea glue can turn waste wood chips or shavings into useful wood boards. In addition, there are new glues for textiles, organic glues for bonding metal, wood, paper, glass, cloth, and plastic.

    A white crystalline substance called "Hexarool," about the size of a camphor tablet, is a compressed fuel made for travelers and geological explorers. Each piece burns long enough to cook a meal.

            Rapid Development

    Poland is a country with abundant chemical industry raw materials, rich in coal, natural gas, sulfur, rock salt, lime, gypsum, etc. Grochowski said that last year the Polish chemical industry increased production by 18%, which is twice as fast as the average increase in the entire Polish industry. During the third five-year plan (1961-1965), the output value of the chemical industry will double, but this is still not enough to meet the needs of the national economy. In the next six years, the direction of development of the Polish chemical industry will mainly focus on vigorously developing fertilizers, pesticides, plastics, synthetic fibers, synthetic rubber, dyes, pharmaceuticals, soda, and other sectors. Invest in expanding the existing nitrogen fertilizer plants to increase the daily output of synthetic ammonia to 2,000 tons. Accelerate the construction of a chemical complex in Tarnobrzeg, southeastern Poland, that produces one million tons of sulfur, hundreds of thousands of tons of sulfuric acid, and phosphate fertilizer annually. To develop the petrochemical industry, build an oil refinery in Płock with an annual processing capacity of 450,000 tons of crude oil. Expand the soda plant in Janikowo to increase its annual output to 300,000 tons. In nitrogen fertilizer production, natural gas will be used as a raw material more extensively in the future.

    迅速发展中的波兰化学工业
    涛中
    化学工业在波兰工业中是后起之秀，近来已发展成为规模巨大的工业部门。目前这个部门的产值相当于战前的十二倍多，产品在七千种以上，在许多方面已达到或者即将赶上世界先进水平。今年初在华沙举办的波兰化学工业新产品展览会就充分证明了这一点。展出的新产品约五百多种，分属于九个化学联合公司，集中地反映了波兰化学工业的成就和发展前途，给参观的人留下了深刻的印象。
            万能的塑料
    展览会的内容丰富多彩。走进展览馆，就可以看到一艘透明的塑料马达快艇，还有船用罗盘针、航行用降落伞式的信号灯、汽车操纵盘、印刷板、有机玻璃做的化学仪器……。讲解员向我们介绍说，波兰的造船业和机器制造业正在不断扩大使用塑料代替有色金属。这样不但可以克服原材料不足的困难，还可大大降低成本。不仅如此，塑料本身还有金属所不具备的优点，例如前面所看到的马达快艇，它和金属一样结实，但由于重量轻，因而速度就可以更快一些。陪同我们参观的展览会负责人格罗霍夫斯基同志也指着一种用塑料绝缘纸包起来的电话总机线说，塑料电气材料和绝缘材料性能都很好，这种电线可以一千人同时通话，而一般电话总机线只能五十人同时通话。另外，一块按照线路涂上塑料的薄铜片，据说可以不用铜丝导线，只要直接装上真空管等，就成为袖珍收音机。
    塑料不但能代替金属，还可做木材和皮革的代用品，制成各种人们日常的生活用品。我们在这里看到一种非常舒适的皮沙发，它没有用一根弹簧和一块皮革。还有用玻璃绳和塑料做的椅子，用塑料板做桌面的桌子以及涂了塑料的各种家具，这些家具既轻巧又美观，色泽明亮，闪闪发光，使人非常喜爱。另外，用塑料做的各种物美价廉的皮制品，如皮包、皮鞋等种类很多。一种宛若麂皮的塑料皮鞋，成本只有一般皮鞋的十分之一。
    用塑料制成的墙壁材料、泡沫墙板、地板、屏风、幕布等，具有隔音、防潮、耐热、耐寒、不怕气温变化等许多特点。塑料已深入到人民的物质和文化生活的各个方面，新产的五彩画片、细纹唱片、五彩电影和照像胶卷、不燃的电影胶卷、X光胶卷、珍珠赛璐珞包装袋等都说明了这一点。
        新的“橡胶园”
    几年前就听说波兰南部靠近喀尔巴阡山的地方在开辟一个大“橡胶园”。谁都知道在波兰的气温条件下，热带的橡树是无法生长的。但这里的“橡胶园”拥有的却是不受气候条件限制的奇怪的橡树机器，把煤和石灰放进去，就会长出橡胶来。在这次展览会上我们看到了这个“橡胶园”出产的第一批产品。据说今年的产量将由去年的五千吨增加到两万吨。这样一来，不仅可满足波兰本国对合成橡胶的需要，还可出口一部分。
    新的橡胶制品，如飞机轮胎、汽车轮胎、摩托车和农业机械用轮胎、窗帘布等都是用尼龙做的。还有无内胎的自行车轮胎、不怕燃烧的矿用运输带、泵用活塞、化学滤过板、蓄电池外壳、船用水龙带和橡皮艇等。
    医用橡皮氧气袋移动很方便，旅行用橡皮床，各种小孩玩具应有尽有。观众们喜爱的目光投射在一双双冬用胶皮靴上，这种靴子不仅外观美丽，里面还有很厚的绒毛里子，可以保暖，非常实用。
        合成纤维和染料
  如果前几年尼龙织物在波兰还是昂贵的奢侈品，那么，近两年来由于本国合成纤维产量的增长，尼龙织品的价格已随之下降，妇女们穿尼龙袜子和尼龙衣服的日渐普遍。展览会上展出了大量斯梯龙织品以及去年试制成的合成羊毛毛线衣和其他织品。这些合成纤维织品的色泽比天然丝和羊毛织品漂亮得多，而最大的好处是这种纤维的增产速度比天然丝和天然羊毛要快得多。讲解员向我们介绍说，今年波兰斯梯龙的产量将达到四千五百吨。
    染料是美化各种织物的必需品。波兰现在每年产各种染料七千多吨，品种达数百种。这里展出去年的新染料共八十九种，例如纳夫妥染料、木材染料等。一种叫“波洛金”的染料是波兰特产的花布染料，色泽鲜艳，耐洗耐酸的程度为四级和五级，可以在蒸汽中印染，胜过西德的“拉彼多金”染料。还有乳浊染料，专染合成纤维。
    为农业和保健事业服务
    在参观杀虫剂部分时，格罗霍夫斯基向我们介绍说，杀虫剂在波兰化学工业中的地位日益重要。波兰是个盛产裸麦、马铃薯和甜菜的国家。近年来马铃薯和甜菜连续发生了虫害，杀虫剂的需要量因而大增。为此，化学工业在大力发展这方面的生产。去年生产了十二种新杀虫剂，杀虫效很大，产量亦有较大的提高，今年计划要增产41％。
    他接着说，杀虫剂是农作物的药品，化肥则是它的营养品，两者都是提高农业生产的重要因素。虽然这里没有展出各种肥料，因为不是新产品，但波兰在发展化肥方面也取得了较大的成就。去年化肥的产量增加了13％，今年磷肥和氮肥将分别达到二十万七千吨和二十四万四千吨。
    随后，我们又参观了药品方面的六十二种新产品，其中有六种新抗生素，小儿麻痹症预防针、治风湿症的“普拉德尼松”、防止晕船或晕飞机的“阿维尔玛林”药片等等。墙上的标记注明这些药品过去几乎全靠进口。
    有趣的漆、胶和燃料
    看过了波兰新产的发动机油、汽缸油、变压器和钻探机用油等十种工业用油和各种船用漆、飞机、汽车和机器用漆后，格罗霍夫斯基同志领我们去看几种有趣的产品。一种叫“尼特罗波力吐拉”的油漆，用酒精溶化后涂在家具上，会使家具非常光亮而保持木材原有的色泽和花纹。铸件上先涂以有机胶油灰使表面平整，再喷上一种叫“海买尔什拉克”漆就会光泽异常。“布塔普伦”漆和“布塔拉斯特”胶能使废皮变成有用的皮革。三聚氰胺胶和尿素胶可以使废木屑或刨花变成有用的木板。此外还有新的纺织品用胶，金属、木材、纸张、玻璃、布和塑料等相互胶合用的有机胶。
    一种叫做“海克沙鲁尔”的白色结晶体，每块大小和樟脑片差不多，这是为旅行者和地质勘探人员制造的压缩燃料，每块燃烧起来够做一顿饭。
            迅速发展
    波兰是一个拥有丰富化学工业原料的国家，盛产煤、天然煤气、硫磺、石盐、石灰、石膏等。格罗霍夫斯基说，去年波兰化学工业增产18％，比整个波兰工业平均增产速度快一倍。第三个五年计划期间（1961—1965年），化学工业产值将增长一倍，但这和国民经济的需要来比还是不够的。今后六年中波兰化学工业的发展方向主要是大力发展化肥、农药、塑料、合成纤维、合成橡胶、染料、医药、苏打等部门。投资扩建现有的氮肥厂，使合成氨的日产量达到二千吨。在波兰东南部塔尔诺布热格地方加速建设年产一百万吨硫磺、数十万吨硫酸和磷肥的化学联合厂。为了发展石油化学工业，在普洛茨克地方兴建年加工四十五万吨原油的炼油厂。扩建亚尼科渥地方的苏打厂，使其年产量达到三十万吨。在氮肥生产中今后将扩大利用天然煤气作原料。（附图片）
