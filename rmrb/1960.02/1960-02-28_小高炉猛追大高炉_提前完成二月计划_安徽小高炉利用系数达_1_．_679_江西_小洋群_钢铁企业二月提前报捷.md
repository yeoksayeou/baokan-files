Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 27th: Anhui Province's small blast furnace ironmaking enterprises have achieved significant results in technological innovation and technological revolution. The average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in the province reached 1.679 in January, and slightly increased in the first and middle ten days of February. Due to the increased utilization coefficient, the output of one furnace this year is more than the output of two and a half furnaces in the same period last year. By the 25th, the February national plan had been completed ahead of schedule. The qualified rate of pig iron from small blast furnaces reached over 90%, and the coke ratio decreased by 43.8% compared to the same period last year. This excellent achievement once again proves the strong vitality of small blast furnaces.

At the beginning of this year, small blast furnaces in various parts of Anhui first focused on the technical transformation of the air supply system, gas system, and raw material management. The technical transformation in these areas is a key measure found in last year's small blast furnace technical transformation to further improve and consolidate small blast furnaces. So far, 70% of the province's small blast furnaces have been fully transformed.

At the end of last year, the province universally adjusted the blowers of small blast furnaces. The amount of air blown into the furnace per minute generally reached five to six times the effective volume of the small blast furnace, creating a material basis for small blast furnaces to achieve high air volume and high air temperature operation. This year, in order to fully utilize the capacity of the blowers, various places expanded the diameter of the cold and hot air pipes, changed the "V" shaped pipe in the hot blast stove from separate casting to integral casting, changed the "T" shaped joint of the pipeline to a "human" shaped joint, reduced pipeline elbows, prevented air leakage, and increased the amount of air entering the furnace. At the same time, various places actively adopted measures such as double dust removal, centrifugal dust removal, water spray dust removal, and gas washing to reduce dust when gas enters the furnace. The gas pipes of small blast furnaces throughout the province were generally thickened, and the multi-nozzle combustion device was improved. Therefore, the air temperature increased from 500 degrees Celsius to over 600 degrees Celsius.

Small blast furnaces transformed in this way have taken on a new look, and their output has greatly increased. After the small blast furnaces in Hefei City transformed the air supply system, the output increased by 40% compared to before. More than ten small blast furnaces in Huainan City, which were transformed in January, increased their output by more than 50% compared to before. The output of eight small blast furnaces in Wuhu City also increased by 30% after the transformation.

After achieving high air volume and high air temperature operation, in order to enhance the air permeability of small blast furnaces, small blast furnaces in various parts of Anhui have strengthened raw material management. First of all, the particle size of ore entering the furnace was reduced, and strict grading was implemented to ensure that the particle size of ore entering the furnace was uniform. The ore particle size currently used in various places is generally between 5 mm and 25 mm. The quality of coke has also improved. In addition, various places have vigorously promoted sintered ore, adopting local methods to sinter ore; experimented with and promoted the experience of Aoshan Iron Mine of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company in using water washing to beneficiate ore, improving ore quality and making full use of ore powder; and vigorously promoted the use of lime instead of limestone in furnaces to reduce the coke ratio.

Various weak links serving small blast furnaces have also undergone technical transformation. For example, manual crushing and screening of raw materials have been changed to mechanization, manual transportation has been changed to rail transportation, manual iron tapping has been changed to opening machines, and mud guns made of earth have been used to plug iron tapping holes. After Wuhu City's Gejiang Geological, Political and Legal, and Red Flag steel plants used crushers to replace manual crushing of ore, work efficiency improved and 80% of the labor force was saved. Workers at Bengbu Steel Plant in Bengbu City manufactured nine combined crushers to replace manual crushing, screening, and conveying of ore, realizing the combined automatic operation of crushing, screening, and conveying three processes. The workload that previously required 5,000 people can now be completed by only 350 people, increasing work efficiency by more than 14 times. The workers said: "Combined crushing is a treasure, saving labor is no small measure, used to take thousands of men, now just a fraction of them, work efficiency is more than ten times better, and the quality is even better than before." Many steel plants have achieved vehicle transportation through self-reliance. Bengbu Steel Plant laid more than ten small railways and self-made three locomotives in more than two months, and all in-plant transportation has been done by locomotives and rails. These measures have played a great role in improving the production level of small blast furnaces.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 27th: Jiangxi Province's small "foreign groups" steel enterprises, after overfulfilling the January production plan, overfulfilled the February steel production plan ahead of schedule on the 23rd and 25th respectively; among them, steel output increased by 2.8% compared to the entire previous month, and iron output increased by 30.6%.

In February, the small "foreign groups" steel enterprises in the province, focusing on weak links such as in-plant transportation, air temperature, and technical operations, launched a mass movement of technological revolution and technological innovation, promoting advanced experience and advanced operating techniques in complete sets, thereby greatly improving production capacity. In terms of in-plant transportation, the technical innovation movement of vehicle transportation, rail transportation, hoisting, and cableway transportation was fully launched and achieved great results. Pingxiang Steel Plant erected cableway coal loading equipment on the earthen coke ovens, increasing work efficiency by three to four times. The plant also successfully trial-produced a coke breaking machine, which can complete the two processes of coke crushing and screening at the same time, increasing work efficiency by ten times, thereby ensuring the supply of coke. Workers at Yingtan Steel Plant made their own earthen hoists. Originally, four people could load eight batches of materials per hour, but now two people can load up to sixteen batches of materials per hour. Workers at Ji'an Steel Plant used earthen iron to cast iron rails, made their own mine cars, and also made a double-track "earthen hoist" that could go up and down, enabling the entire plant to realize vehicle transportation, rail transportation, hoisting, and mechanized ore crushing, increasing transportation efficiency by seven times.

Steel enterprises in various places also widely organized "attack teams" and "breakthrough teams" to point the spearhead of technological innovation at the weak links in production operations and equipment utilization. Nanchang Steel Plant seized weak links such as full wind plugging, iron tapping, charging, and air temperature, and established a general command headquarters for the attack, led by the party secretary and factory director, organizing cadres above the workshop director level, technicians, and old workers into breakthrough assault teams to carry out technical demonstrations and break through many technical barriers. Pingxiang Steel Plant, in response to the shortcomings of the No. 5 furnace tuyere water tank leaking and often being burned, organized an "old worker attack team" including smelting, machine repair, power, and other types of workers, changing the circular tuyere to a crescent shape, increasing the water pressure, eliminating the phenomenon of the tuyere being burned, and increasing the daily output by 14.1% compared to the previous month, with an average utilization coefficient maintained above one. Workers at Hongdu Steel Plant launched a "hot air high temperature" performance competition, increasing the molten iron temperature from 1,100 degrees Celsius to 1,300 degrees Celsius, and shortening the iron tapping time from fifteen minutes to about eleven minutes. The plant also boldly adopted the hot charging steelmaking method, increasing the converter shift output from 20 tons to 50 tons.

In order to continuously promote the leap forward in steel production, party committees at all levels in Jiangxi Province have strengthened specific leadership. In late January, the provincial party committee and local party committees established steel production leading groups, and leading cadres personally engaged in "experimental fields." Leading cadres of various factories and mines also went deep into the front line, participating in production and leading production, greatly inspiring the enthusiasm of workers and promoting production.

    小高炉猛追大高炉　提前完成二月计划安徽
    小高炉利用系数达1．679
    江西“小洋群”钢铁企业二月提前报捷
    新华社合肥27日电　安徽省小高炉炼铁企业技术革新和技术革命取得重大成果。1月份小高炉的利用系数全省平均已经达到一点六七九，2月上、中旬又略有提高。由于利用系数提高，今年一个炉子的产量比去年同期两个半炉子的产量还要多，到25日止，已提前完成2月份国家计划。小高炉生铁的合格率达到90％以上，焦比比去年同期下降43．8％。这一优异成就，又一次证明小高炉具有强大的生命力。
    今年一开始，安徽各地小高炉就首先抓紧送风系统、煤气系统、原料管理三个方面的技术改造工作。这些方面的技术改造，都是在去年小高炉技术改造中找到的进一步提高和巩固小高炉的带关键性措施。到目前为止，全省已有70％的小高炉得到了全面改造。
    去年年底全省普遍调整了小高炉的风机，每分钟鼓入炉内的风量一般达到小高炉有效容积的五、六倍，为小高炉实现大风量、高风温操作创造了物质基础。今年为了充分发挥风机能力，各地又扩大了冷热风管的直径，把热风炉内的“V”型管由分铸改为整铸，把管道的“丁”字形接头改为“人”字形接头，减少管道弯头，防止漏风现象，增加了入炉的风量。同时，各地积极采取双除尘器、离心式除尘、喷水除尘、煤气通过水洗等办法，减少煤气入炉时的灰尘。全省小高炉的煤气管普遍加粗，并且改进了多嘴燃烧装置。因此风温由摄氏五百度提高到六百度以上。
    经过这样改造的小高炉，生产面貌焕然一新，产量大大增加。合肥市的小高炉改造送风系统以后，产量比以前提高40％；淮南市1月份改造的十多座小高炉，产量比以前提高50％以上。芜湖市八个小高炉改造后，产量也提高30％。
    实现大风量、高风温操作以后，为了增强小高炉的透风性，安徽各地小高炉都加强了原料管理工作。首先缩小矿石入炉粒度，严格分级，使矿石入炉粒度均匀。各地目前使用的矿石粒度，一般都在五毫米到二十五毫米之间。焦炭质量也有了提高。此外，各地都大搞烧结矿，采用土法烧结矿石；试行推广马鞍山钢铁公司凹山铁矿利用水洗选矿的经验，提高矿石质量，充分利用矿粉；大力推广用石灰代替石灰石入炉，降低焦比。
    为小高炉服务的各个薄弱环节，也进行了技术改造。例如原料场的人工破碎、筛分改为机械化，人工运输改为轨道运输，人工开铁口改用开口机，堵铁口用土制泥枪等。芜湖市戈江地质、政法、红旗等钢铁厂用破碎机代替人工破碎矿石后，工效提高，节约了80％的劳动力。蚌埠市蚌埠钢铁厂的工人制造了九台联合破碎机，用机器代替人工破碎、筛分、输送矿石，实现破碎、筛分、输送三道工序联合自动进行，过去五千人完成的工作量，现在只要三百五十人就行，工效提高十四倍多。工人们说：“联合破碎是个宝，节约劳力真不少，从前要用几千人，现在零头用不了，工效提高十几倍，质量还比过去好。”不少钢铁厂都自力更生地实现了运输车子化。蚌埠钢铁厂在两个多月的时间内，铺成十一条小铁路，自制三辆机车，厂内运输已全部用机车、轨道。这些措施对于提高小高炉生产水平，都起了很大作用。
    新华社南昌27日电　江西省小洋群钢铁企业继超额完成1月份生产计划之后，又在23日和25日，分别提前超额完成了2月份的钢铁生产计划；其中，钢产量比上月全月增长2．8％，铁产量增长30．6％。
    2月份，全省小洋群钢铁企业针对厂内运输、风温、技术操作等薄弱环节，大搞技术革命和技术革新的群众运动，成套地推广了先进经验和先进操作技术，从而大大地提高了生产能力。在厂内运输方面，全面展开车子化、轨道化、卷扬化、索道化的技术革新运动，收到了很大效果。萍乡钢铁厂在土焦炉上架起了索道装煤设备，提高工效三、四倍。这个厂还试制成功破焦机，能同时完成焦炭的破碎、筛分两道工序，提高工效十倍，从而保证了焦炭供应。鹰潭钢厂职工自己制造了土卷扬机，原来四个人每小时上八批料，现在两个人每小时最高能上十六批料。吉安钢铁厂职工用土铁铸造铁轨，自己制造矿车，还制成一种能上能下的双轨“土卷扬机”，使全厂实现了车子化、轨道化、卷扬化和碎矿机械化，运输效率提高七倍。
    各地钢铁企业还广泛组织“攻关队”、“破关队”，把技术革新矛头指向生产操作和设备利用中的薄弱环节。南昌钢铁厂抓住全风堵口、出铁、上料、风温等薄弱环节，设立攻关总指挥部，由党委书记、厂长带头，把全厂工长以上干部和技术员、老工人组成破关突击队，进行技术表演，突破了很多技术关。萍乡钢铁厂针对五号炉风口水箱漏水常被烧坏的缺点，组织了包括冶炼、机修、动力等各工种的“老工人攻关队”，把圆形风口改为月牙形，增大水压，消除了风口被烧坏的现象，使日产量比上月提高14．1％，平均利用系数保持在一以上。洪都钢铁厂职工开展“热风高温”表演赛，使铁水温度由一千一百度提高到一千三百度，出铁时间由十五分缩短到十一分钟左右。这个厂还大胆地采用热装炼钢法，使转炉班产量由二十吨提高到五十吨。
    为了使钢铁生产不断跃进，江西省各级党委都加强了具体领导。1月下旬，省委和各地党委成立钢铁生产领导小组，领导干部亲自搞“试验田”，各厂矿企业领导干部也深入第一线，参加生产、领导生产，大大鼓舞了职工的干劲，推动了生产。
