What a Scene of Innovation with Dragons Leaping and Tigers Soaring
Changchun Workers Propose Over 185,000 Technical Innovation Suggestions in Just Over a Month
Jinan Factories Achieve 1,358 Mechanization Projects in January
Guiyang Achieves Mechanization and Semi-Mechanization in Fifty Factories and Mines, and Eighty-Four Workshops

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun – The technical innovation and technical revolution movement in Changchun's industrial, transportation, capital construction, and financial and trade sectors is developing more extensively and deeply. From January this year to the present, workers throughout the city have proposed more than 185,000 technical innovation suggestions, implemented more than 94,000, successfully created 147 automatic production lines, 507 continuous (assembly line) production lines, and automated and jointly automated more than 2,000 machine tools. In the industrial system, workers in 3,784 types of work processes have been freed from manual labor; the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization in factories above the district level throughout the city has increased from an average of 46.6% to over 54%. The capital construction system has equipped 43 sets of advanced machinery for 138 processes in ten major types of work, and heavy manual labor such as concrete mixing and the horizontal and vertical transportation of brick and tile mortar has been replaced by machinery.

From the very beginning, Changchun's technical innovation and technical revolution movement has implemented the principle of self-reliance and making the best use of simple equipment. In technical innovation, it proceeds from reality, adopting foreign methods when possible, and local methods when foreign methods are not feasible. For example, most of the 25 belt-driven machine tools in the Changchun Machine Tool Factory were 30 to 40 years old and had very low efficiency. During the technical innovation movement, workers adopted simple methods and converted all these old machine tools into gear-driven machine tools in just thirteen days, allowing one machine tool to perform the work of two.

While universally mobilizing workers to carry out innovation, all industries and factories have paid attention to focusing on key areas. For example, the industrial system focuses on solving manual operations, the transportation sector focuses on improving loading and unloading efficiency, and the capital construction sector focuses on types of work that require the most manpower and have the greatest labor intensity. Once an innovation appears in these key areas, efforts are immediately organized to appraise and improve it, and it is vigorously promoted, thus achieving results in many places. All units have also fully promoted the spirit of communist cooperation in the movement. The style of large factories helping small factories, machinery helping light industry, and industry helping other sectors has spread throughout the city. Major universities and scientific research departments have also participated in this movement. The electronic automatic control metering instrument created by the Xiuli Grain and Oil Supply Store in Chaoyang District was successfully tested with the help of more than 40 units, including the Changchun Automobile Factory, Changchun Metrology Bureau, Jilin University of Technology, Electromechanical Research Institute, Applied Chemistry Research Institute, Jilin Provincial and Changchun Municipal Post and Telecommunications Bureaus.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan – In carrying out the technical innovation movement, industrial enterprises in Jinan have created and modified more than 2,300 sets of various special-purpose equipment, and built 15 automatic and semi-automatic assembly lines and 13 mechanized production linkage lines.

Under the leadership of the Jinan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the city's workers put forward the fighting slogan: "Shed the old ox and ride the fine horse, mechanize manual operations," and the upsurge of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement surged forward with unstoppable momentum. From December of last year to the end of January this year, workers throughout the city proposed a total of 76,681 technical innovation suggestions, and implemented 28,563 of them. In January of this year alone, factories throughout the city implemented 1,358 mechanization projects, 205 automation projects, and manufactured or modified 2,366 sets of special-purpose equipment. According to statistics at the end of January, the level of mechanization in industrial and mining enterprises throughout the city had increased from 44.7% in December of last year to 61.35%. Many enterprises with a high degree of mechanization were determined to transform mechanical operations into automatic production lines from the beginning of this year. On January 13, the Jinan Automobile Manufacturing Plant built two semi-automatic assembly lines for the first time. The experience of this factory quickly blossomed and bore fruit in industrial and mining enterprises throughout the city, and automatic, semi-automatic assembly lines and mechanized production linkage lines emerged one after another.

The emergence of these automatic, semi-automatic assembly lines and mechanized production linkage lines has multiplied the level of production, saved a lot of manpower and equipment, and improved the working conditions of workers. For example, the mechanized production linkage line for assembling shock absorbers built in the machine shop of the Jinan Automobile Manufacturing Plant not only saved 22 laborers to support other departments, but also doubled efficiency. Workers used to stand to work, but now they sit to work.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, February 22 – The technical innovation and technical revolution movement in Guiyang's factories and mines has entered a new stage centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization. A large number of factories and mines mainly engaged in manual operations have developed from general tool reforms to major reforms in mechanical equipment, and from partial and sporadic technical innovations to large-scale and comprehensive technical transformations based on types of work and work processes. By the end of January, 50 factories and mines and 84 workshops throughout the city had achieved mechanized and semi-mechanized production; one factory and eleven workshops had achieved continuous production. The continuous improvement of production tools has promoted a straight-line increase in production. According to statistics from 64 major factories and mines throughout the city, the total value of production in January increased by 4.2% compared to December of last year, breaking the convention of slackness at the beginning of the year and tightness at the end.

Since the Guiyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the call to "March towards mechanization and semi-mechanization" in December of last year, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in factories and mines throughout the city has rapidly entered a climax. According to incomplete statistics from the beginning of January to February 10, workers throughout the city proposed more than 92,000 rationalization proposals, of which the rationalization proposals proposed in January alone increased by 62% compared to December of last year. In the movement, all factories and mines paid special attention to combining it with current production and focusing the spearhead of innovation on the weak links and key issues in production. In the process of innovation, a communist style of cooperation was promoted among factories, mines, workshops, work processes, and workers, helping each other solve difficult problems, thus enabling many innovation projects to blossom and bear fruit quickly, and powerfully promoting current production. After the Guizhou Automobile Manufacturing Plant mechanized and semi-mechanized 40 manual operation processes and semi-automated and automated 10 processes in January, work efficiency increased by one to one hundred and sixty times respectively, ensuring the early completion of the January production tasks.

    好一片龙腾虎跃的革新景象
    长春职工一个多月提出技术革新建议十八万五千多件
    济南各工厂一月份实现机械化项目一千三百五十八项
    贵阳五十个厂矿、八十四个车间实现机械化半机械化
    据新华社长春电　长春市工业、交通运输、基本建设和财贸部门的技术革新和技术革命运动，正在日益广泛深入地向前发展。从今年1月到现在，全市职工提出技术革新建议十八万五千多件，实现了九万四千多件，创造成功一百四十七条自动生产线，五百零七条连续化（流水作业）生产线，并使两千多台机床达到了单机自动化和联合自动化。在工业系统中，有三千七百八十四种工序的工人脱离了手工操作；全市区以上工厂的机械化半机械化程度，由原来平均46．6％提高到54％以上。基本建设系统在十个主要工种一百三十八个工序中配成先进机具四十三套，混凝土搅拌和砖瓦灰浆的水平垂直运输等笨重体力劳动，已由机械代替。
    长春市技术革新和技术革命运动一开始就贯彻了自力更生、因陋就简的原则，在技术革新中，从实际出发，能洋则洋，不能洋则土。如长春市机床厂，原有的二十五台皮带机床大部分都有三、四十年历史，效率很低。在技术革新运动中，工人们采用简易办法，仅在十三天内就将这些旧机床全部改为齿轮变速机床，使一台机床顶两台使用。
    在普遍发动职工进行革新的同时，各行业各工厂都注意了大抓重点。如工业系统以解决手工操作为重点，交通部门以提高装卸效率为主，基本建设部门是以占用人力最多劳动强度大的工种为主等等。在这些关键问题上一旦出现革新，就立即组织力量加以鉴定、提高，大力推广，因此达到了一地开花遍地结果。各个单位还在运动中充分发扬了共产主义协作精神。大厂帮小厂、机械帮轻工、工业帮其他行业之风遍及全市。各大专学校、科学研究部门也都参加了这一运动。朝阳区秀丽粮油供应店创造的电子自动控制计量仪，就是在长春汽车厂、长春市计量局、吉林工业大学、机电研究所、应用化学研究所、吉林省、长春市邮电局等四十多个单位帮助下，试验成功的。
    据新华社济南电　济南市工业企业在开展技术革新运动中，已经创制和改制了各种专用设备二千三百多台，建成自动化和半自动化流水生产线十五条、机械化生产联动线十三条。
    这个市的职工在中共济南市委的领导下，提出了：“甩开老牛跨骏马，手工操作机械化”的战斗口号，技术革新与技术革命运动高潮以一泻千里之势滚滚向前。自去年12月至今年1月底，全市职工共提出技术革新建议七万六千六百八十一件，实现二万八千五百六十三件。仅今年1月份，全市工厂就实现了机械化项目一千三百五十八项，自动化项目二百零五项，制成或改成专用设备二千三百六十六台。到1月底统计，全市工矿企业机械化程度已由去年12月的44．7％提高到61．35％。许多机械化程度较高的企业职工，今年一开始就决心把机械操作变为生产自动线。济南汽车制造厂，在1月13日首次建成两条半自动流水生产线。这个厂的经验迅速在全市工矿企业开花结果，自动化、半自动化流水生产线和机械化生产联动线纷纷出现。
    这些自动化、半自动化流水生产线和机械化生产联动线的出现，使生产水平成倍的增长，节省了大量的人力和设备，改善了工人的劳动条件。例如济南汽车制造厂在机工车间建成的一条装配减震器的机械化生产联动线，不仅节约了二十二个劳动力支援其他部门，还提高效率一倍，工人过去是站着干活，现在是坐着干活了。
    据新华社贵阳22日电　贵阳市各厂矿的技术革新和技术革命运动已经跨入一个以机械化、半机械化为中心的新阶段。大批以手工操作为主的厂矿，已从一般地改革工具发展到机械设备上的重大改革，从局部的零星的技术革新发展到按工种，工序大规模的全面技术改造。到1月底止，全市已有五十个厂矿、八十四个车间实现了机械化、半机械化生产；有一个工厂、十一个车间实现了生产连续化。生产工具的不断改进，促使生产直线上升。据全市六十四个主要厂矿的统计，1月份的生产总值比去年12月份提高了4．2％，打破了年初松年底紧的常规。
    自中共贵阳市委在去年12月发出“向机械化、半机械化进军”的号召后，全市各厂矿的技术革新和技术革命运动就迅速进入了高潮。据1月初到2月10日的不完全统计，全市职工提出的合理化建议就有九万二千多件，其中仅1月份提出的合理化建议，就比去年12月份增长62％。各厂矿在运动中都特别注意了结合当前生产，把革新的矛头集中指向生产中的薄弱环节和关键问题。在革新过程中，各厂矿、车间、工序、工人之间大兴共产主义协作之风，互相帮助解决疑难问题，因而使许多革新项目很快开花结果，有力地促进了当前生产。贵州汽车制造厂在1月份使四十道手工操作工序实现机械化和半机械化、十道工序实现半自动化和自动化后，工效分别提高一倍到一百六十倍，保证了1月份生产任务提前完成。
