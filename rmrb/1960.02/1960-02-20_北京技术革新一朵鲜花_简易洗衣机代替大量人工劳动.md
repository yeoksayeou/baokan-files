    A Blossom of Technological Innovation in Beijing
    Simple Washing Machines Replace a Large Amount of Manual Labor
    (Our report) The Beijing Civil Electrical Appliance Factory is producing simple washing machines in batches. The first washing machine successfully trial-manufactured has been delivered to the Tianqiao Subdistrict Office for use. This washing machine can wash more than 200 pieces of clothing per hour, equivalent to the manual labor of 40 people. The Civil Electrical Appliance Factory began trial-manufacturing washing machines in November last year. At that time, the factory had no drawings or technical data. They visited the Qianmen Hotel and the Xiliushujing Bathhouse. They used the indigenous washing machine of the Xiliushujing Bathhouse as a model, made further modifications, and manufactured it in twelve days. This washing machine is very efficient; more than 40 pieces of clothing can be washed in fifteen minutes. When washing, only a bar of soap and a little more than a pound of alkali are used, which saves soap compared to hand washing. After this washing machine was delivered to the Tianqiao Subdistrict Office, it was very popular among the residents of the subdistrict.
    Many hotels, laundry shops, and childcare organizations in Beijing have also recently self-made various indigenous or combined indigenous-foreign simple washing machines.
    The hand-cranked wooden washing machine of the Erlonglu Chayuan Kindergarten in Xicheng District was jointly made by the kindergarten teachers and the street production department. The washing machine is a wooden barrel smaller than a gasoline drum, covered with lead-iron sheet, with a crank on the side. The labor and material costs for making this washing machine totaled only more than 80 yuan, and the washing efficiency is five times higher than hand washing. The washing machine of the Qingtaihe Hotel was manufactured by the hotel staff themselves. The shape is similar to the wooden hand-cranked machine, but the volume is larger, all made of iron, and driven by a motor. When the switch is turned on, the clothes and alkali water rotate back and forth, causing a washing effect. The washing efficiency is increased twenty times. Now, many units in the city have followed the example of these units and manufactured various washing machines themselves.

    北京技术革新一朵鲜花
    简易洗衣机代替大量人工劳动
    本报讯　北京民用电器厂正在成批生产简易洗衣机，试制成功的第一台洗衣机已经交给天桥街道办事处使用。这台洗衣机每小时可以洗衣二百多件，相当于四十个人的手工劳动。民用电器厂是从去年11月间开始试制洗衣机的。当时厂里没有图纸和技术资料。他们就到前门饭店和西柳树井浴池参观。他们把西柳树井浴池的土洗衣机当样板，做了进一步修改，用十二天的时间就制出来了。这台洗衣机效率很高，四十多件衣服用十五分钟就洗好了。洗的时候，只放了一条肥皂和一斤多碱，比用手工洗节省肥皂。这台洗衣机交天桥街道办事处使用以后，很受街道居民的欢迎。
    北京的许多旅馆、洗染商店、托儿组织最近也自制了各种土的或土洋结合的简易洗衣机。
    西城区二龙路察院幼儿园的手摇木制洗衣机是幼儿园的老师和街道生产部门配合制成的。洗衣机是一个比汽油桶较小的木条圆桶，外包铅铁皮，旁边有个摇把。制作这台洗衣机的人工和材料费一共只花了八十多元钱，洗衣效率比手洗提高五倍。庆泰和旅馆的洗衣机是由旅馆服务员自己制造的。形状也和木制手摇机相似，但体积较大，全部用铁制，由马达带动，把开关打开，衣服和碱水就往复轮转，发生洗涤作用。洗衣效率提高二十倍。现在，全市已有许多单位仿照这些单位自己动手制造了各种洗衣机。
