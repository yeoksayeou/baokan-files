Changsha, February 6th (Report from this newspaper) - Anren County, Hunan Province, has achieved excellent results in the manure accumulation campaign by focusing on pig raising for manure accumulation as the central link in establishing fertilizer bases, while also vigorously grasping the accumulation and production of various fertilizers. From late October of last year to the Spring Festival, the county has accumulated and produced over 215.75 million dan of various fertilizers. After deducting the 4.545 million dan already used for topdressing winter crops, there is a remaining fertilizer stock of 211.2 million dan, averaging 578 dan of fertilizer per mu of cultivated land, an increase of 233 dan per mu compared to the same period last year. The 150,000 mu of green manure in the county is also growing well.

At the beginning of the manure accumulation campaign, the Anren County Committee of the Communist Party of China first focused on the central link of pig raising for manure accumulation, vigorously developing the pig raising industry and vigorously grasping pig raising for manure accumulation. The county's pig production has increased from over 80,000 head in stock in September of last year to over 110,000 head, an increase of 30%. The County Committee has decided to develop 400,000 pigs this year, reaching 1.1 pigs per mu of land and an average of 2.1 pigs per person. Calculating 80 dan of manure per pig per year, a total of 32 million dan of manure can be accumulated annually. Coupled with green manure and lime, the source of fertilizer in the future can be basically solved. In order to ensure the rapid development of the pig raising industry and achieve the goal of raising more pigs and accumulating more manure, all communes, brigades, and production teams in the county have established seven 10,000-head pig farms, 113 1,000-head pig farms, and 735 100-head pig farms. In addition, canteens and individual commune members also raise a small number of pigs. All pig farms have formulated a "four guarantees, one reward" (guarantee output, guarantee cost, guarantee fertilizer, guarantee work points, and reward for exceeding output and fertilizer) responsibility system and specific management measures, assigning pig raising and manure accumulation tasks specifically to the team and farm, and all the way down to the breeders. Manure accumulation tasks are allocated according to the number of pigs raised, with specific arrangements made on a seasonal and monthly basis. The completion of manure accumulation tasks is checked monthly, and competitions are held and rewards are given quarterly, greatly stimulating the enthusiasm of breeders for raising pigs and accumulating manure. The straw needed for pigsty padding is arranged uniformly and comprehensively by the brigades according to their specific conditions and handed over to the pig farms at a discounted price. The fertilizer from the pig farms is also handed over to the production teams based on a price graded according to quality. It is also stipulated that 80%-85% of the fertilizer accumulated by the pig farms of communes, brigades, production teams, and canteens, and by individual commune members, should be used for the production of paddy fields and dry land, and 15%-20% should be used for feed land and vegetable land. Thanks to the strengthened leadership of the Party committees at all levels in pig raising and manure accumulation, 5.91 million dan of pigsty manure has now been accumulated, which is 42% more than the total amount of pig and cattle manure in the same period last year.

While vigorously grasping pig raising for manure accumulation, the Anren County Committee of the Communist Party of China has made comprehensive and unified arrangements for the accumulation and production of natural fertilizers and the cultivation and management of green manure, and has focused on four key issues. First, county and commune levels have established working bodies, with the secretaries in charge of industry and finance and trade being responsible, and with dedicated personnel to grasp lime production and soil fertilizer manufacturing. In each evaluation and inspection of production work, pig raising and manure accumulation, natural fertilizer accumulation, soil fertilizer production, and green manure cultivation were all included as important evaluation and inspection contents, and a comprehensive evaluation and inspection was conducted. Second, labor was comprehensively and rationally arranged, and specialized teams for accumulating and producing fertilizers in various aspects were established. Of the more than 60,000 men and women full and part-time laborers regularly participating in agricultural production in the county, 30,000 were arranged to burn fire soil ash and accumulate grass skin, fallen leaves, and other natural fertilizers. The cultivation and management of green manure were assigned to dedicated personnel, with one person assigned to manage every 30 to 40 mu of land. Even during the intense water conservancy movement, more than 2,000 people were retained to engage in the cultivation and management of green manure. Third, helping communes solve specific problems in the manure accumulation and production movement. For example, Guangong Commune did not understand the technology of lime burning, did not have a lime kiln, and all the required lime was supported by other communes. In order to solve this technical difficulty, under the leadership of the County Committee, Chengping Commune took the initiative to transfer twelve technicians to Guangong Commune to impart technology. Now Guangong Commune has trained 38 technicians and developed 13 lime kilns, and has burned 31,500 dan of lime. Fourth, the advanced experience in the fertilizer production movement was promoted in a timely manner, pushing the manure accumulation and fertilizer production movement to a new climax again and again.

In the manure accumulation movement, Anren County also paid great attention to fertilizer management and protection. There are more than 20,000 fertilizer storage sheds and 2.19 million fertilizer ponds in the county, averaging one large fertilizer storage shed every 30 mu of land and six to seven small fertilizer ponds per mu of land. Ponds are used for paddy fields, and composting is used for dry land. In order to better improve the fertilizer efficiency of the ponds, they have now been turned over twice, which has greatly accelerated the decomposition of the fertilizer, thereby improving fertilizer efficiency. All production teams have established domestic fertilizer collection plants and fire soil ash plants, and each work group is equipped with a domestic fertilizer collector who collects fertilizer every half month, ensuring that fertilizer is collected by dedicated personnel and stored in factory sheds. Chengping, Nanping, and Eshi Communes have also universally promoted mobile toilet sheds in production labor. Where people are producing, there are mobile toilet sheds, which not only stores fertilizer but also saves a lot of time.

Now, the County Committee has also proposed to launch a five-pronged balanced manure accumulation movement assault week from February 5th to 15th, involving large-scale accumulation, burning, production, collection, and storage, to welcome the spring plowing and production.

Zhengzhou, February 6th (Report from this newspaper) - Shangqiu County, Henan Province, has greatly improved the efficiency of delivering fertilizer to wheat fields and spring land by vigorously promoting the rail transportation of field.

The county has built 2,017 field transport soil rails made of wood, a combination of wood and brick, and glazed brick, with a total length of 6,232 li. It has manufactured 6,182 rail cars and has transported 5.29 billion jin of fertilizer to wheat fields and spring land. All 480,000 mu of wheat in the county have been topdressed two to three times, and the base fertilizer for 480,000 mu of spring land has also been delivered to the fields one month ahead of schedule. Due to the use of soil rails for fertilizer transportation, the county has transferred 20,000 laborers from fertilizer delivery to support water conservancy construction, which will enable the completion of water conservancy projects one month ahead of schedule. These soil rails are also used for short-distance transportation of agricultural and sideline products such as cotton and oilseeds, and for transporting coal and other industrial products back. Currently, 75% of the field fertilizer transportation tasks and about 25% of the short-distance transportation tasks in the county are undertaken by soil rails, saving a total of 2.24 million labor days and increasing transportation efficiency by 20 to 25 times.

The rail transportation of field was proposed by Liu Xueqin, the First Secretary of the County Committee, in the movement to vigorously develop water conservancy construction and manage wheat fields last winter, in order to solve the shortage of labor and transportation tools. After discussions with commune and team cadres and the masses, offering suggestions and contributing ideas, and joint research, it was made in imitation of the soil rails used to transport soil on water conservancy construction sites. Because this type of rail has simple paving technology, uses local materials, and has low cost, it was quickly promoted throughout the county. The use of rail transport greatly improved efficiency. One animal can pull four to six carriages, with a carrying capacity of 8,000 to 16,000 jin, which is 16 to 20 times more efficient than the local original Taiping carts. Currently, the rail transportation of fields in this county is moving towards semi-mechanization. Xin Hua, Le Ma, and other communes have already used 17 coal gas engine-converted "soil locomotives," which can carry 12 carriages at a time, weighing more than 20,000 jin, and can replace the work of 40 livestock and 20 laborers.

The county has built soil rails with trunk lines leading to transportation arteries, wharves, and towns, and branch lines leading to fields, high-yield squares, and fertilizer plants. In addition, pig farms, forest farms, pastures, and feed rooms have also established dedicated lines, forming a soil rail transportation network that connects communes, links villages, and connects all squares. In order to facilitate the communication between communes, between rural areas and towns, and between wharves, the soil rails are generally two feet and one inch wide, and more than 1,000 "small train stations" have been established at various bends and turns, and traffic regulations and maintenance systems have been formulated.

The construction of soil rails fully embodies the superiority of the people's communes. Due to the development of commune-run industry, most of the blue bricks are made by the commune's own brick and tile factories. In order to save wood, workers at the brick and tile factories are mass-producing glazed bricks to replace wood rails with glazed brick rails. Communes have launched socialist cooperation, concentrating efforts to rush construction and accelerate the pace of construction.

    养猪积肥为主　广辟各种肥源　为大丰收准备充足肥料
    安仁县普建肥料基地肥多质好
    全县积制各种肥料二亿一千多万担　每亩施肥比去年增长二百三十多担
    商丘遍用土轨道运肥节省劳力两万个季节提前一个月
    本报长沙6日电　湖南省安仁县在积肥运动中，抓住养猪积肥为中心建立肥料基地，同时大抓积制各种肥料收效很好。从去年10月下旬至春节止，全县已积制各种肥料二亿一千五百七十五万担，除冬种作物追肥已用去四百五十四万五千担外，现存肥二亿一千一百二十万担，平均每亩耕地有肥料五百七十八担，与去年同期比较，每亩平均增加肥料二百三十三担。全县十五万亩绿肥，也生长良好。
    在搞积肥运动一开始，中共安仁县委首先抓紧以养猪积肥为主这个中心环节，大力发展养猪事业，大抓养猪积肥。全县的生猪生产，已由去年9月存栏的八万多头，增加到十一万多头，增长30％。县委决定今年计划发展生猪四十万头，达到一亩地有一点一头猪，每人平均有二点一头猪。每头猪按全年积肥八十担计算，全年可积肥三千二百万担，加上绿肥和石灰，今后的肥源问题，就可基本解决。为了保证生猪事业的迅速发展，达到多养猪多积肥的目的，全县各公社、大队、生产队已分别建立了七个万头猪场，一百一十三个千头猪场，七百三十五个百头猪场，另外还有食堂和社员私人也养有小量的生猪。各个养猪场都制订了“四包、一奖励”（包产、包成本、包肥料、包工分，超产超肥奖励）的责任制度和具体管理办法，把养猪积肥任务具体分配到队到场，一直落实到饲养员，按养猪多少，分配全年的积肥任务，分季分月具体安排，按月检查积肥任务完成情况，按季进行评比奖励，大大发挥了饲养员养猪积肥的积极性。养猪场所需要的垫栏稻草，由各大队根据本队具体情况，统一全面安排，折价交饲养场，饲养场的肥料，也采取按质分等论价的办法交生产队。并规定公社、大队、生产队、食堂的饲养场和社员私人养猪所积的肥料，要有80％—85％用于稻田和旱土的生产，15％—20％用于饲料地和蔬菜地使用。由于各级党委加强了养猪积肥工作的领导，现在已积猪栏肥五百九十一万担，比去年同期猪、牛栏肥的总数还多42％。
    中共安仁县委在大抓养猪积肥的同时，对积制自然肥料和绿肥的培育管理工作，都作了全面的统一的安排，并突出的抓住了四个关键性的问题。首先是县、社都成立办事机构，由工业、财贸书记负责，并配有专人抓石灰生产和土化肥的制造工作。在每次评比检查生产工作时，把养猪积肥、积自然肥、制土化肥、培育绿肥，都作为重要的检查评比内容之一，进行了全面的评比检查。第二、全面地合理地安排好劳动力，建立了各方面积制肥料的专业队伍。全县经常出勤投入农业生产的男女全半劳动力有六万多人，其中安排烧火土灰、积草皮、木叶等自然肥料的就有三万人。绿肥的培育管理都确定有专人负责，每三十至四十亩地配有一人专管，就是在紧张的水利运动中，也留有二千多人搞绿肥的培育管理工作。第三、帮助公社解决积制肥料运动中的具体问题。如关王公社因不懂烧石灰的技术，没有一个石灰窑，所需的石灰，全部是由外社支援的。为了解决这个技术力量上的困难，在县委领导下，承坪公社就主动抽调了十二个技术工人，到关王公社传授技术。现在关王公社已培养技术人员三十八人，发展了十三个石灰窑，已烧出石灰三万一千五百担。第四、及时推广制肥运动中的先进经验，把积肥造肥运动一再推向高潮。
    在积肥运动中，安仁县也十分注意管肥保肥工作。全县有肥库二万多个，肥氹二百一十九万个，平均每三十亩田有一个大肥库，每亩田有六至七个小肥氹，水田搞肥氹，旱土搞堆肥。为了更好地提高氹肥的肥效，现在已普遍翻过二次，这就大大加速了肥料腐烂，从而也就提高了肥效。各个生产队都建立有家肥收集厂，火土灰厂，作业组配有一个家肥收集员，每半个月收集一次，做到了肥料有专人收集，肥料有厂棚储存。承平、南坪、鹅市公社在生产劳动中，还普遍推行了流动厕所棚，那里有人生产，那里就有流动厕所棚，这样既储存了肥料，同时又节省了很多时间。
    现在，县委又提出在2月5日至15日，再开展一个大积大烧大制大收集大保管五大的平衡积肥运动突击旬，迎接春耕大生产。
    本报郑州6日电　河南省商丘县大搞田间运输轨道化，大大提高了为麦田、春地送肥的效率。
    全县已修木质、木砖合制和琉璃砖制的田间运输土轨道二千零十七条，长达六千二百三十二华里，制造有轨列车六千一百八十二辆，已向麦田春地送肥五十二亿九千万斤，全县四十八万亩小麦已经普施了二至三遍追肥，四十八万亩春地的底肥也已提前一个月送到地头。由于利用土轨道运肥，全县从送肥劳力中抽调两万个劳力支援水利建设，将使水利工程提前一个月完成任务。这些土轨道还用来短途运输棉花、油料等农副产品，运回煤炭等工业品。现在全县占75％的田间运肥任务和占25％左右的短途运输任务已由土轨道担任，共节省二百二十四万个劳动日，提高运输效率二十到二十五倍。
    田间运输轨道化是在去冬全县大搞水利建设又抓麦田管理的运动中，县委第一书记刘学勤为了解决劳力和运输工具不足而提出的，经过社队干部和群众座谈，献计献策，共同研究，模仿水利工地上运土的土轨道而制作。这种轨道由于铺轨技术简单，就地取材，造价低廉，很快就在全县迅速推广，使用轨道运输效率大大提高，一头牲口可拉四到六个车厢，载重量在八千到一万六千斤，比当地原用的太平车工效高十六到二十倍。现在这个县的田间运输轨道化正向半机械化迈进。新华、勒马等公社目前已使用十七个煤气机改装的“土火车头”，运肥一次可以带十二辆车厢，载重两万多斤，可以代替四十头牲畜和二十个劳力的工作。
    全县已建成的土轨道有通向交通要道、水旱码头和城镇的干线，有通向地头、丰产方、肥料厂的支线，另外猪场、林场、牧场、饲料室也都建立了专用线，这样就构成了一个社队相通，村村相连，方方相接的四通八达的土轨道运输网，为了便利公社与公社、农村与城镇、码头之间的来往，土轨道一般都是二尺一寸宽，各个转弯抹角的地方还建立了一千多个“小火车站”，并制定了行车规章和养护制度。
    土轨道的建设充分体现了人民公社的优越性，由于社办工业的发展，大部分青砖都是公社的砖瓦厂自己烧制的，为了节省木材，砖瓦厂的工人正在大量烧制琉璃砖，改木轨为琉璃砖轨。各公社开展了社会主义大协作，集中力量突击修建，加快了建设进度。
