Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 16th. "Soviet Air Force News" published a commentary today entitled "Old Illness Returning," saying that recently, the "Cold War" ailment of some American military personnel has relapsed. The first to fall ill was US Strategic Air Command Commander Thomas Power. He raved in a fever, saying that the Soviet Union could destroy America's nuclear strike force in thirty minutes. Strangely, Power's rant became a signal for senior American military personnel to openly and widely discuss the so-called "atomic threat" to the United States. US Air Force Secretary Dudley Sharp and Air Force Chief of Staff Thomas White also suffered a relapse of their old illness. They openly called for strengthening the arms race, increasing military budgets, and intensifying nuclear testing.

The commentary concluded by saying that the American military personnel's dependence on monopoly capital has led them to once again shoulder the mission of the "Cold War." Of course, they themselves do not believe in the so-called "Soviet atomic threat," but as the saying goes, "Whoever hitches up the cart, has to pull it."

    “苏联空军报”发表评论
    谴责美国军人“冷战”狂叫
    据新华社莫斯科16日电　“苏联空军报”今天以“老病发作”为题发表评论说，最近，一些美国军事人员的“冷战”老病又发作了。第一个发病的是美国战略空军司令托马斯·鲍威尔。他发烧狂叫，说什么苏联能够在三十分钟以内消灭美国的核打击力量。奇怪的是，鲍威尔的叫嚷变成了美国高级军事人员公开广泛议论对美国的所谓“原子威胁”的信号。美国空军部长达德利·夏普和空军参谋长托马斯·怀特也同样地老病复发。他们公开要求加强军备竞赛，增加军事预算，加强核试验。
    评论最后说，美国军事人员对垄断资本的依赖使得他们重又担负起了“冷战”的使命。当然，他们自己也不会相信所谓“苏联的原子威胁”，但是正如俗话所说的一样，“谁驾起辕，谁就得拉着车走”。
