Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 6th. "Voice of the Republic of Algeria" radio said tonight that De Gaulle should know that his deceptive means cannot whitewash his imperialist policies, and the Algerian people will continue their heroic struggle until they achieve independence.

The radio station made these comments when commenting on De Gaulle's recent dismissal of some ministers after the rebellion of French extreme colonialist elements.

The radio station said that the French imperialist propaganda machine is using this opportunity to create the impression that De Gaulle is really willing to dismiss those who oppose any improvement in the situation in Algeria, and that he is seriously working to solve the Algerian problem. This propaganda attempts to divert the world's attention from the bloodshed in Algeria.

The radio station emphasized that French propaganda cannot deceive world opinion, especially the Algerian people. The radio station also said that De Gaulle dismissed these elements only to consolidate his power and implement his Algerian policy, which is based on continuing the Algerian war.

The radio station finally said that the fighting Algerian people know very well that it is De Gaulle who launched the "sweeps" against them, it is De Gaulle who is intensifying the suppression in Algeria, and it is also De Gaulle who is trying to prevent the Algerian people from obtaining freedom and independence.

    “阿尔及利亚共和国之声”评论说
    法国的欺骗宣传骗不了人
    戴高乐是镇压阿尔及利亚人民的元凶
    新华社开罗6日电　“阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台今天晚上说，戴高乐应该知道，他的骗人的手段粉饰不了他的帝国主义政策，阿尔及利亚人民将继续他们的英勇斗争，直到获得独立时为止。
    这家电台是在评论戴高乐最近在法国极端殖民主义分子叛乱之后撤销了一些部长的职务一事时发表这些意见的。
    这家电台说，法帝国主义者的宣传机器利用这个机会来制造这种印象：戴高乐真的愿意把那些反对阿尔及利亚的形势有任何改善的人撤职，他正在认真地为解决阿尔及利亚问题而努力。这种宣传企图转移全世界对阿尔及利亚流血事件的注意。
    这家电台着重指出，但是，法国的宣传不能欺骗世界舆论，特别是不能欺骗阿尔及利亚人民。这家电台还说，戴高乐撤销这些分子的职务只是为了巩固他的权力，并且执行他的阿尔及利亚政策，这种政策是以继续进行阿尔及利亚战争为基础的。
    这家电台最后说，战斗的阿尔及利亚人民知道得很清楚，对他们发动“扫荡”的是戴高乐，在阿尔及利亚加强镇压的是戴高乐，企图使阿尔及利亚人民迟迟不能取得自由和独立权利的也是戴高乐。
