Four New Long Novels
    “Riding the Wind and Waves”
    Following "Primary Power" and "Locomotive," writer Cao Ming has produced his third novel depicting the working class, "Riding the Wind and Waves." If "Primary Power" and "Locomotive" describe the struggle and life of the working class before the national liberation and during the economic recovery in the early days of national liberation, "Riding the Wind and Waves" depicts the struggle and life of the working class in an integrated iron and steel enterprise. These three novels, like a continuous industrial history, depict the historical face of industrial development in New China under the leadership of the Party.
    "Riding the Wind and Waves" depicts the fervent battle to seize steel during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Through this boiling life, it profoundly reflects the complex contradictions and struggles on the industrial front between advanced and backward workers, advanced and conservative ideas, collectivism and departmentalism, putting politics in command and a purely technical viewpoint, the Party's industrial line and the bourgeoisie's industrial line. It can be said to be a good work that correctly depicts the contradictions among the people, and persuasively expresses the changes in the mental outlook of people and the high-speed development of productive forces. In this novel, the author has also created some unforgettable characters, such as the model furnace foreman, young worker Li Shaoxiang, the old worker Liu Jinchun, Shao Yunduan, the municipal propaganda minister who firmly adhered to the Party's principles and waged a resolute struggle against the bourgeois industrial line, and Song Zifeng, the steel plant director who was capable and energetic but had deep-rooted right-leaning conservative ideas.

        “Three Family Lane”
    Ouyang Shan's "Three Family Lane" has been published by Guangdong People's Publishing House. It is the first volume of his "A Generation of Talents." It depicts the revolutionary struggle life before and after the Great Revolution of 1927. Through the mental outlook and life paths of three young people, it reflects the fierce and turbulent class struggle at that time. The three families in "Three Family Lane" are the epitome of the semi-feudal and semi-colonial Chinese southern urban society. The Zhou family representing the working class, the Chen family representing the comprador bourgeoisie, and the He family representing the bureaucratic landlord class, are the main classes of the urban society of that era. The novel broadly depicts the local customs and the mental outlook of young revolutionaries in their enlightenment period. The reflection of social life during this period—the ebb and flow of class forces and the struggle of contradictions before and after the Great Revolution, and the changes in the political situation—are written with great depth. The author's delicate brushstrokes are characterized by traditional artistic expression methods. However, there are still some differences in the evaluation of certain characters in this novel, such as the protagonist of the novel, Zhou Bing, among readers. Some articles of contention have been published in Guangzhou newspapers and literary publications, and "Literary Gazette" in its second issue of 1960 also published Zhao Yan's review, "Overture to the Revolutionary Spring and Autumn."

        “Taihang Storms”
    "Taihang Storms" by Liu Jiang, published by Shanxi People's Publishing House, is a novel depicting the revolutionary rural struggle life in the Taihang Mountains. Although the novel only writes about one village—Qilipu—it is rich in the characteristics of the history of changes in revolutionary rural areas. It comprehensively depicts the intense and turbulent life from the establishment of the Party in the countryside in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War to the agricultural cooperation. The vivid depiction of the revolutionary historical life of this village highlights the power of the Party's rural work lines and policies in each revolutionary historical period in reaching the masses and penetrating the hearts of the people. It uses flesh-and-blood artistic images to confirm the theme of the novel—under the leadership of the Party, "the masses have seen their own great future." The prominent feature of this revolutionary rural change history mainly lies in the fact that it powerfully proves the consistent correctness of the Party's line and the historical inevitability of the vast number of peasants resolutely taking the socialist road with rich and true pictures of struggle life.
    The novel also creates some characters with rich class struggle and distinctive personality. Among them are Fang Zhengkui, the grassroots leading cadre of the Party, and Guan Yinbao, Sanhai, Xiaowu, and Haisheng, the backbone members of the poor and lower-middle peasants who have been tempered for a long time under the cultivation of the Party. Among the characters of the antagonistic class, Li Baotai, the vicious and cunning white-eyed wolf landlord of Qilipu, and the lackeys San Da Jian and Hui Hui Lian, are also relatively successful characters. In particular, the image of "Gu Bu Tou" Li Gui, a wealthy middle peasant, should be said to be a particularly successful character created in this novel.
    The novel's mass-oriented language and the vivid description of the customs and local conditions of the Taihang Mountains are also very characteristic and attractive. (Mo)

    "People Yearn for Happiness, Trees Yearn for Spring"
    "People Yearn for Happiness, Trees Yearn for Spring" reflects the course of rural cooperativization and the life style of rural areas on the eve of the high tide of agricultural cooperation through the story that happened in a village in Yunnan.
    The book prominently portrays the image of the poor peasant Song Jinshan. This poor man, who had lived on wild vegetables and sleeping in cattle sheds since childhood, only tasted the sweetness of life after he turned over. He loves the Party and unswervingly follows the Party. He had been an old militiaman and participated in the suppression of bandits and the elimination of local tyrants; he had taken the lead in participating in mutual aid groups; and after the establishment of the cooperative, he worked selflessly for the cooperative and for everyone. Because of this, he was hated by hidden counter-revolutionaries such as Wu Gong and landlord Bai Zuwang. They stole the cooperative's wheat, and then shifted the blame to Song Jinshan. They came up with all kinds of ways to frame him and slander him, and finally even prepared to assassinate him; however, these did not scare Song Jinshan. He still believed in the Party and still unswervingly followed the Party. The author wrote about this character in considerable detail and depth. His image is believable and touching. From this character, we once again realize and appreciate the correctness of the Party's class line of firmly relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants in the countryside.
    From the book, we can also see that Song Jinshan's growth is inseparable from the Party's education and help. County Party Secretary Gao Lixia, Township Party Branch Secretary Tang Xingcheng, Deputy Director Xu Zhengliang and others are Party workers who are hardworking and simple and wholeheartedly serve the people. They have a meticulous work style, are good at going deep into the masses, relying on the masses, and understanding the thoughts and wishes of the masses; and for Song Jinshan, they constantly help him to improve his class consciousness, so that he becomes more and more clear-eyed and sees clearly what path he should take.

### 长篇小说新作四种

第8版()
专栏：新书架

    长篇小说新作四种	“乘风破浪”
    继“原动力”、“火车头”之后，作家草明同志又写出了他的第三部描写工人阶级的长篇小说“乘风破浪”。如果说“原动力”和“火车头”是描写的全国未解放前和全国解放初期经济恢复时期的工人阶级的斗争和生活，“乘风破浪”就已经描写的是钢铁联合企业的工人阶级的斗争和生活。这三本小说像一部连续性的工业史一样，写出了在党的领导下新中国工业发展的历史面貌。
    “乘风破浪”描写了1958年大跃进中的火热的夺钢大战，并通过这种沸腾的生活，深刻地反映了工业战线上的先进工人和落后工人、先进思想和保守思想、集体主义和本位主义、政治挂帅和单纯技术观点、党的工业路线和资产阶级的工业路线……之间的错综复杂的矛盾和斗争，可以说是一本正确地描写了人民内部矛盾，并富有说服力地表现了人的精神面貌的变化和生产力高速度发展的好作品。在这本小说里，作者还创造了一些令人难忘的人物形象，像模范炉长青年工人李少祥，老工人刘进春，坚持党的原则和资产阶级工业路线进行坚决斗争的市委宣传部长邵云端，能干、有魄力而有很深的右倾保守思想的钢铁厂厂长宋紫峰等。　（帆）
        “三家巷”
    欧阳山同志的“三家巷”，已由广东人民出版社出版，这是他的“一代风流”的第一卷。它描写了1927年大革命前后的革命斗争生活，通过三个青年的精神面貌和生活道路反映了当时的激烈动荡的阶级斗争，“三家巷”里的三个家庭，就是半封建半殖民地的中国南部都市社会的缩影。周家所代表的工人阶级，陈家所代表的买办资产阶级，何家所代表的官僚地主阶级，也就是这个时代的都市社会的主要阶级。小说广阔地描写了那个时代的风土人情和青年革命者的启蒙时期的精神面貌，对于这个时期的社会生活的反映——大革命前后阶级力量的消长和矛盾斗争，政治舞台的风云变幻，都写得很有深度。作者的细腻的笔触，富有传统的艺术表现方法的特色。不过，对于这本小说中的某些人物形象，像小说的主人公——周炳，在读者中间，评价还有些分歧。在广州的报纸和文学刊物上，已经发表了一些争论文章，“文艺报”的1960年第二期也发表了昭彦的“革命春秋的序曲”的评论。　（希）
        “太行风云”
    山西人民出版社出版的刘江同志的“太行风云”，是一本描写太行山区革命农村斗争生活的小说。小说虽然只写了一个村庄——七里铺，却富有革命农村变迁史的特征，它全面地描绘了从抗日战争初期农村建党，一直到农业合作化这一长段历史时期激烈动荡的生活。小说对这个村庄的革命历史生活的生动的描绘，突出而鲜明地描写了党在每个革命历史时期农村工作的路线、政策的深入群众、深入人心的威力，用有血有肉的艺术形象，印证了小说的主题——在党的领导下，“群众已经看见了自己的伟大前途”。这个革命农村变迁史的显著特征，主要是在于它用丰富而真实的斗争生活的画面，有力地证明了党的路线的一贯正确和广大农民坚决走社会主义道路的历史必然性。
    小说还创造了一些富有阶级斗争和富有个性的人物形象。其中有党的基层领导干部方正奎，有在党的培养下久经锻炼的贫雇农中坚分子共产党员观音保、三孩、小五、海生等；在敌对阶级的人物里，像七里铺恶毒奸狡的白眼狼大地主李宝泰，狗腿子三大件、灰灰脸，也是写得比较成功的人物，特别是“估不透”李贵这个富裕中农的形象，应该说是这本小说里创造得特别成功的人物。
    小说的群众化的语言和太行山区的风土人情的富有生活情调的描写，也是很有特色，很吸引人的。　（默）
    “人望幸福树望春”
    “人望幸福树望春”通过云南一个村庄发生的故事，反映了农村合作化的历程，表现了农业合作化高潮前夕的农村的生活风貌。
    书中突出地刻划了贫农宋金山的形象。这个从小就靠吃野菜、睡牛圈房度日的苦人，翻身以后，才尝到了生活的甜味。他热爱党，坚定不移地跟着党走。他曾经当过老民兵参加过清匪反霸，他曾经带头参加互助组；而成立社以后，他更是忘我地为社、为大家工作。正因为如此，他遭到暗藏的反革命分子吴工、地主白祖旺等的憎恨。他们偷走社的麦子，然后把祸转嫁到宋金山头上，他们想出种种办法来陷害他，诬蔑他，最后甚至准备暗杀他；可是，这些并没有吓倒宋金山，他仍然相信党，仍然坚定不移地跟随着党。作者对这个人物写得相当细致深刻，他的形象是可信的，感人的。从这个人物身上，我们再次认识到体会到党在农村中坚决依靠贫雇农的阶级路线的正确性。
    从书中也可以看到，宋金山的成长，是和党的教育帮助分不开的。县委书记高丽霞、乡党支部书记唐兴成、副社长徐正良等人，是艰苦朴素、一心一意为人民服务的党的工作者。他们工作作风细致，善于深入群众，依靠群众，了解群众的思想和愿望；而对于宋金山，他们更不断地帮助他提高阶级觉悟，使他越来越擦亮了眼睛，看清自己应该走什么样的道路。
