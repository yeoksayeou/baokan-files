Intercropping and Relay Planting: One Mu Used as Three

    Shanxi Yicheng County Dongguan Management District Achieves Unprecedented Grain and Vegetable Harvests with Multiple Cropping Per Year
    Sichuan Dazu County Vigorously Promotes Planting Methods of "Three Crops in One Field" and "Two Crops in One Soil"

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Dongguan Management District of Chengguan People's Commune in Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, has been striving to increase land utilization and boldly implementing intercropping and relay planting, changing from one crop a year to two, three, or four crops a year, resulting in an unprecedented increase in yield per unit area. In 1959, the average grain yield per mu in the entire management district was 848 jin, the cotton yield per mu was 290 jin of ginned cotton, and the average vegetable yield per mu was 10,200 jin. The value created by each laborer reached 1,541 yuan. If we calculate the average annual living expense of each agricultural person at 100 yuan, the value created by one laborer in this management district can support fifteen people.

    Due to the increase in the multiple cropping index and the improvement of labor productivity, the total value of ginned cotton, vegetables, and other products sold to the state by the entire management district in 1959 reached more than 267,000 yuan, an increase of 1.54 times compared to 1958. In addition to the public accumulation turned over to the commune, the actual income of the commune members increased significantly.

    This management district has a large population and limited land. In recent years, it has experimented with intercropping and relay planting on some land, accumulating experience. However, during the period of advanced cooperatives, the scope of operation was small, and the multiple cropping method could not be fully promoted. After the establishment of the People's Commune, the original Dongguan and Nanguan advanced cooperatives merged into one management district. Under the unified leadership of the commune, the advanced experience of "multiple cropping per year" was widely promoted. In the entire management district, 241 mu of land were planted with two crops a year, 244 mu with three crops a year, and 384 mu with four crops a year; in addition, five crops a year were also tested. In 1959, the actual planting area reached 2,750 mu, which is three times the original cultivated area, achieving the goal of using one mu of land as three.

    The specific methods for implementing multiple cropping per year are: double cropping involves intercropping vegetables in wheat or cotton fields; triple cropping involves sowing spinach seeds on the ridges of wheat fields while planting wheat. After harvesting the spinach around the Qingming Festival in the second year, and harvesting the wheat in the summer, fennel cabbage is planted; four crops a year involve planting garlic in early winter, intercropping cotton in the garlic fields in the second year, intercropping cowpeas after harvesting the garlic, and planting radishes after harvesting the cowpeas; five crops a year involve planting Chinese cabbage roots in early March, planting small Chinese cabbage in early April, planting cotton in mid-April, intercropping lettuce in early May, and planting radishes in late July. This intercropping not only ensures that the various crops do not affect each other but also has the benefits of loosening the soil.

    Due to the increase in the multiple cropping index and the implementation of intensive cultivation, this management district encountered difficulties such as labor shortages and fertilizer shortages. After studying these problems, the Party branch believed that reforming tools and realizing agricultural mechanization and semi-mechanization were the fundamental ways to overcome these difficulties. At the same time, the Party branch led the "Red, Diligent, and Skillful" competition, promoted the advanced experience of "one person, multiple skills" and "one machine, multiple uses," and called on everyone to engage in technological innovation. The management district modified and newly manufactured a total of 323 tools throughout the year, which strongly promoted the improvement of labor productivity.

    (Xinhua News Agency) Sichuan Province's Dazu County is widely promoting the "two vegetables, three grains" cropping system in this year's spring plowing production campaign to fully utilize the land's fertility, strive for five harvests a year, and achieve the goal of multiple planting and harvesting.

    In seizing continued agricultural leaps forward this year, Dazu County is vigorously carrying out both a "seize every inch of land" campaign, finding every possible way to expand arable land, and vigorously undertaking intercropping and relay planting to raise the multiple cropping index. With "two vegetables and three grains" as the core, they are vigorously promoting the planting methods of "three crops in one field" and "two crops in one soil."

    Their specific methods are: in the existing carrot fields, plant two rows of wheat every two rows of carrots. After the carrots are harvested, use the open space and between the rows of wheat to sparsely plant a season of early corn, and plant string beans at the same time. After the wheat is harvested, the corn and string beans grow together. The growing period for the string beans is only forty to fifty days. After harvesting them, plant sweet potatoes between the rows of corn. After harvesting the corn, build mounds around the sweet potato vines. After implementing this cropping system, the average income from the same mu of land can generally increase by more than twofold. This not only greatly increases grain production but also increases vegetable and feed production.

    Currently, on the 50,000 mu of land planned for planting "two vegetables and three grains" throughout the county, they are actively rushing to harvest carrots, strengthening the seedling management of wheat, and arranging for the sowing of the next season's crops.

### 间作套种一亩地顶三亩用  山西翼城县东关管理区一年多作粮食蔬菜空前丰收  四川大足县大力推行一田三物一土两物的种植方法

    间作套种一亩地顶三亩用
    山西翼城县东关管理区一年多作粮食蔬菜空前丰收
    四川大足县大力推行一田三物一土两物的种植方法
    本报讯　山西翼城县城关人民公社东关管理区，千方百计地提高土地利用率，大胆地实行了间作套种，由一年单作改为一年双作、三作、四作，单位面积产量空前提高。1959年，全管理区粮食平均亩产八百四十八斤，棉花亩产皮棉二百九十斤，蔬菜平均亩产一万零二百斤，每个劳动力创造的价值达一千五百四十一元。如果以每个农业人口全年生活费平均为一百元计算，这个管理区一个劳动力创造的价值能养活十五人。
    由于土地复种指数的增加和劳动生产率的提高，1959年全管理区出售给国家的籽棉、蔬菜等价值达二十六万七千多元，比1958年增长了一点五四倍。除了上缴公社的公共积累以外，社员实际收入大大增加。
    这个管理区人多地少，几年来，曾在部分土地上试行了间作套种，积累了经验。但是，高级社时期经营范围小，一年多作的耕作方法不能全面推广。人民公社成立以后，原来的东关和南关两个高级社合并成一个管理区，在公社的统一领导下，广泛地推行了“一年多作”的先进经验。全管理区一年两作的地有二百四十一亩，一年三作的二百四十四亩，一年四作的三百八十四亩；此外，还试验了一年五作。1959年实际种植面积达两千七百五十亩，等于原有耕地面积的三倍，做到了一亩田顶三亩用。
    实行一年多作的具体办法是：一年双作是在麦田或棉田里套种蔬菜；一年三作是在种麦的同时，把菠菜籽撒在麦田的垅背上，第二年清明前后收了菠菜，夏季收了麦子以后，再种茴子白；一年四作是初冬栽上蒜，第二年在蒜地里套种棉花，收了蒜套种豆角，收完豆角种萝卜；一年五作是3月初栽白菜根，4月初种小白菜，4月中旬种棉花，5月初套种莴笋，7月下旬种萝卜。这样套种不仅各种作物互不影响，而且还有松土等好处。
    由于提高复种指数和实行精耕细作，这个管理区曾遇到了人力缺乏和肥料不足的困难。党支部研究了这些问题以后，认为改革工具，实现农业机械化和半机械化，是克服困难的根本途径。同时，党支部领导开展了“红勤巧”竞赛，推广了“一人多艺”，“一机多用”的先进经验，号召人人搞技术革新。这个管理区全年共改制和新制工具三百二十三件，有力地促进了劳动生产率的提高。
    据新华社讯　四川省大足县在今年春耕生产运动中，广泛推行“两菜三粮”的耕作制度，充分利用地力，力争一年五熟，达到多种多收的目的。
    大足县在夺取今年农业继续跃进中，一方面大力开展“见缝插针”的增种运动，千方百计扩大耕地面积；一方面大搞套种、间种，提高复种指数，以“两菜三粮”为中心，大力推行一田三物、一土两物的种植方法。
    他们的具体作法是：在现在的胡萝卜地里，每隔两行胡萝卜种上两行小麦。胡萝卜收后，利用空地和小麦行间，稀稀地种上一季早玉米，同时间种上四季豆。小麦收后，玉米和四季豆都长起来了，四季豆生长期只有四、五十天，收后即在玉米行间种上红苕。收玉米后，再给红苕垒蔸。实行这种耕作制度后，同样一亩地的平均收益一般能增加二倍以上。这样，既大大增加了粮食产量，又增产了蔬菜和饲料。
    现在，全县计划种“两菜三粮”的五万亩土地上，正积极抢收胡萝卜，加强小麦的苗期管理，安排下一季作物的播种。
