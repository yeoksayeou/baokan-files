Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, February 27th: In the fields of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, spring water is abundant everywhere. Thousands of reservoirs and ponds are full of water, and the canals are clear. Significant achievements have been made in water storage and conservation. Currently, nearly half of the land that should be spring irrigated has completed its spring irrigation tasks ahead of schedule.

As early as after the autumn harvest last year, various places in the Autonomous Region combined water conservancy construction with water storage and conservation. Currently, the region has stored 2.55 billion cubic meters of water. Adding the water storage capacity of projects completed this year, it can basically meet the needs of spring irrigation. However, due to the uneven distribution of water and the expansion of planting areas in various places, the widespread promotion of advanced technologies such as deep plowing and close planting has correspondingly increased water consumption. Therefore, the Autonomous Region Committee and Party committees at all levels attach great importance to water storage, conservation, and planned water use, treating it as an important measure for the continuous leap forward in agricultural production this year.

In accordance with the characteristics of Guangxi's many mountains and abundant water, and based on the distribution of terrain, water systems, projects, and irrigation areas, larger projects are used as the backbone to connect the ponds, reservoirs, rivers, and canals within the region to form a "long vine bearing melons" style water conservancy irrigation network, implementing unified management and unified use.

    广西春灌又好又快
    据新华社南宁27日电　广西僮族自治区的田野里，四处春水盈盈，千库万塘水满渠通，蓄水保水已取得很大成绩。目前已有近一半应当春灌的田地，提前完成了春灌任务。
    自治区各地早在去年秋收以后，就结合兴修水利进行蓄水保水。现在全区已蓄水二十五亿五千万立方米，加上今年完工工程的蓄水量，基本可以满足春灌用水需要。但由于水量分布不平衡，和各地扩大播种面积，普遍推广深耕、密植等先进技术，相应地增加了用水量。因此，自治区委员会和各级党委，对蓄水保水和计划用水工作非常重视，把它当作今年农业生产持续跃进的一项重要措施。
    各地根据广西山多、水多的特点，按照地形、水系、工程、灌区的分布情况，以较大的工程为骨干，把区域内的塘库河渠互相连通，构成长藤结瓜式的水利灌溉网，实行统一管理，统一使用。
