    Great Changes on a Small Island
    A Record of the Comprehensive Development of the Hailing People's Commune in Yangjiang County, Guangdong
    He Cheng, Lin Wenshan

    Hailing Island, standing in the south of Yangjiang County, Guangdong, with a circumference of ninety li and a population of 41,200, was once a place full of disasters and poverty. Now, it shines like a crystal-clear pearl, attracting attention.

    Before liberation, the oppression and exploitation by feudal landlords, the rampant drought, and the violent attacks of typhoons and tides filled the history of Hailing Island with records of famine, hunger, and death. The scorching sun turned rice seedlings into withered grass, typhoons swept away the seeds sown in the fields along with the silt, and sea waves swallowed up crops and villages. …

    Now, all this has become a thing of the past! Arriving on Hailing Island, you are greeted by lush, thriving rice seedlings and hundreds of mirror-like ponds. In 1956, farmers here dug level ponds and built mountain ponds, raising fish in them, so now there is flowing water and leaping fish. A seawall several meters wide, glittering with gold, is extending straight north. After collectivization in 1956, the per-mu yield of grain reached 536 jin. After the establishment of the People's Commune, the late rice crop in 1958 achieved a bumper harvest of more than 600 jin per mu. Although the early rice crop in 1959 was hit by several strong storms, the per-mu yield still reached more than 400 jin. If you add up the early and late rice crops of 1959, it will certainly greatly exceed 1,000 jin.

    The lives of the peasants have greatly improved. Peasants who could only eat three meals of white rice a year in the past can now eat an average of more than 30 jin of rice per month, and strong laborers can eat more than 60 jin. Now, rice has replaced sweet potatoes as the staple food, dry rice has replaced thin rice gruel, and thick porridge has replaced the watery gruel that was so thin you could see your face in it. What a tremendous change!

    The Water Problem is Solved

    On Hailing Island, surrounded by the sea on all sides, there is not a single river or lake. In the past, 80% of the island's 42,000 mu of cultivated land was constantly threatened by drought. When the drought was severe, even drinking water became a problem. In the first few years after liberation, people were still powerless in the face of nature. In 1956, the Party led the island's farmers, on the basis of collectivization, to liberate the underground water, dig more than 1,600 level ponds in the fields (a general term used by farmers in Yangjiang and other places for a large area of fields), and build many dikes to block the onslaught of the tides, which began to subdue the most devastating drought and rejuvenate the island's agricultural production.

    However, after two years of development, some contradictions that had not appeared in the past gradually emerged; some contradictions that had existed in the past, but could be tolerated, now gradually became acute.

    Among these contradictions, the most prominent problem was still water. Although each cooperative had dug many level ponds and built some mountain ponds, the water sources were not always very balanced between cooperatives. Some had more water than they could use, while others did not have enough. Take Wangtian Field as an example, where the fields of the Shuangfeng, Naguang, and Dannan cooperatives were located. They all dug level ponds, but Naguang had the richest water source, and some of Shuangfeng's fields were still not free from the threat of drought. The collective ownership of cooperatives had greatly broadened people's horizons compared to the small-peasant economy, but it still had its limitations. The limitations of the relatively small-scale cooperative ownership began to be exposed.

    Before, without water, there was no guarantee of harvests, and people rarely felt the need to accumulate fertilizer. Now, people's interest in accumulating fertilizer has increased, but the contradictions have followed. The best fertilizer here is sea fertilizer. In the past, only Guantang Cooperative had the habit and experience of accumulating sea fertilizer. Now, other cooperatives also want to accumulate sea fertilizer, and they are worried that others will take away the good sea fertilizer. Therefore, the cadres discovered sea fertilizer and quietly mobilized the members to go out to sea to collect it, and even asked the members to go out at night.

    In addition, on the issues of exchanging good seeds, rationally adjusting interspersed plots, etc., the contradictions arising from the limitations of small collectives also gradually emerged and became prominent. All of the above contradictions are increasingly becoming stumbling blocks in the continued progress.

    On September 9, 1958, the Hailing People's Commune was established. As soon as it embarked on this path, all the contradictions arising from the limitations of small collectives were readily solved. Among the eleven agricultural brigades (the original advanced agricultural cooperatives) in the entire commune, the original contradictions in the use of water and land were quickly resolved through reasonable adjustments. Moreover, many brigades also cooperated to build some new water conservancy projects that could not be built in the past.

    Similarly, the contradictions in seedlings, fertilizers, etc. have also been resolved. The peanut seeds of the Shitang Brigade were very good, and they were unwilling to exchange them with others in the past. Now, they have supported the Guantang Brigade according to the principle of equal value exchange. Shitang used to suffer from a lack of good rice seeds, and now it has also received help from others. The Baipu Brigade lacked goose and duck seedlings, and received support from Shuangfeng, Naguang, Beiji and other brigades. In addition, the major brigades also supported each other financially through loans. Some time ago, the Guantang Brigade discovered a large amount of "horse manure mud" with high fertilizer efficiency in the sea. They no longer "kept it secret" as in the past, and immediately reported it to the commune. The commune lost no time in mobilizing 10,000 people to go to sea, and collected 25,000 dan of horse manure mud in three days.

    The Relationship Between Fishermen and Farmers Has Improved

    Due to the expansion of the scope of collective ownership and the overcoming of the shortcomings of overly small economic units, the People's Commune has demonstrated great advantages in resolving internal contradictions in the fishing industry and promoting the development of fishery production. In improving the relationship between fishermen and farmers, and organizing large-scale cooperation between fishermen and farmers, the superiority of the People's Commune is even more obvious.

    Zhapu Port is located at the western end of Hailing Island, with more than 12,000 residents, accounting for about 30% of the island's population, mainly engaged in fishing. In the early days of collectivization, the organizational scale of both large fishing boats engaged in deep-sea operations and small fishing boats engaged in shallow-sea operations was very small. In 1956, due to the urgent need for production, more than 100 large boats, based on the original seven elementary fishery production cooperatives, absorbed individual households and united to form the "Seagull" advanced fishery production cooperative. This played a huge role in promoting the development of deep-sea fisheries. They achieved bumper harvests year after year. However, the organizational scale of small boats was still very small, with four or five or ten or so forming a cooperative, and the strength was weak. Cooperation between different types of operations between large and small boats was even more difficult to talk about. The economic differences between large and small boats became increasingly large. In early 1958, in the Great Leap Forward, hundreds of small boats were all merged into a large "Little Seagull Cooperative." Once this large cooperative was established, it built a batch of medium-sized fishing boats to go to the "middle sea" (the sea between the deep sea and the shallow sea), where the original small boats could not go and the large boats rarely went, to carry out production and develop the rich resources in that area. This was a major step forward in fishery production. However, new difficulties and new contradictions also emerged.

    The "Little Seagull Cooperative" lacked experience in offshore operations, had weak technical strength, and lacked equipment and tools, so the output was very low. Moreover, at that time, only the families of the fishermen of the "Great Seagull Cooperative" were settled on land, while the families of the fishermen of the "Little Seagull Cooperative" mostly lived on boats, and therefore could not use the land to carry out activities such as repairing tools. All of these required the "Great Seagull Cooperative" to provide strong support. Of course, the "Great Seagull Cooperative" also needed the assistance of the "Little Seagull Cooperative" in many ways. However, since the large and small "Seagull Cooperatives" were completely independent economic units, various mutual assistance and cooperation activities were not so smooth.

    Originally, the relationship between farmers and fishermen on the island was not very good. Before liberation, both farmers and fishermen were oppressed and exploited by the reactionary ruling class, and their unfortunate fates were the same. The Kuomintang reactionaries, in order to strengthen control, set up a particularly large number of "party headquarters," secret agents, and reactionary armed forces here. They colluded with the local feudal forces, making the suffering of farmers and fishermen even more profound. At the same time, they carried out provocations and divisions between farmers and fishermen, thus creating serious discord between farmers and fishermen, between Zhapu Port and the agricultural area. They had fought big fights and had cases of people losing their lives. Farmers would not sell firewood to fishermen to dry their boats; fishermen would not sell fish to farmers to eat. After liberation, people's awareness increased, and the relationship improved. After collectivization, there was also some mutual support. Fishermen and their families helped farmers transplant rice seedlings and fight drought during the busy farming season, and farmers often helped fishermen make lines, knit nets, dry fish, and pick fish. However, because everyone was not a unified administrative unit (Zhapu was a district-level town, and the Hailing agricultural area was set up as another district, which was later changed to a township), the relationship between each other was not close enough, and there were many contradictions in production; in addition, the blind sectarian emotions left over from history had not been completely eliminated, which made it even more difficult for both sides to cause some disputes in handling problems. Among the Party committee and the leading cadres of various cooperatives, many people had gradually felt that this contradiction was related to the overly small economic units. Therefore, some people began to discuss: "Unless Zhapu and Hailing are combined into a large cooperative, the contradiction cannot be resolved!" It was just that at that time, everyone's thinking was not liberated enough, and they did not have enough courage to seriously consider such a problem.

    The situation of the Great Leap Forward forced people to no longer treat the problem this way. It just so happened that the call for the communization of the people put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao answered this question. It turned out that running a large cooperative on the entire island was not a fantasy, but the only realistic way out and a bright road. Therefore, the Party Committee led the people of the entire island to establish a unified People's Commune. At the same time, it also organized fishermen and farmers to visit each other on a large scale and carry out "fishing and farming are one family" education. From this time on, fishermen and farmers often took care of each other in production and life, and their mutual assistance and cooperation made many things that could not be done or even imagined in the past possible.

    In production, fishermen have given farmers tremendous support in many ways. In the past, fishermen would throw back into the sea fish that could not be eaten or were not valuable. After communization, in order to support agricultural production, they collected these fish. Every time they returned from the sea, a boat would carry forty or fifty dan of fish fertilizer, providing a steady stream of raw materials to the commune's fertilizer factory. Agricultural brigades went to Zhapu to accumulate fertilizer, and they were supported by the families of fishermen in Zhapu. Not long after communization, in one movement, the families of fishermen collected more than 280,000 dan of snail fertilizer and sea mud fertilizer for farmers. During the deep plowing and soil improvement in the winter of 1958 and the summer harvest and planting in 1959, fishermen and their families supported agricultural production with more than 20,000 workdays. During the spring plowing in 1959, which was the peak season for fishery production, the fishery brigade loaned more than 190,000 yuan in plowing expenses to the agricultural brigade.

    Fishermen also provided support to semi-fishermen and farmers in terms of equipment and tools. Fishing is seasonal. During the season when they can fish in the deep sea, large fishing boats will not fish in the shallow sea. Semi-fishermen and farmers produce more in shallow seas. In the past, semi-fishermen and farmers lacked funds and were poorly equipped. Now, fishermen can lend their tools that they do not use temporarily to semi-fishermen and farmers. After communization, Zhapu lent more than 1,100 nylon gill nets, 37 fishing boats, and a large number of other tools to semi-fishermen and farmers in this way. All of this greatly enhanced the productive power of semi-fishermen and farmers.

    Farmers also provided support to fishermen in the same way. In 1958, Zhapu carried out large-scale fishery infrastructure construction, requiring many materials. When they lacked timber for loading and repairing ships, the commune organized more than 400 farmers to go to the Guigang mountain area in Yangchun County to cut down and transport more than 2,000 cubic meters of fir and 150 cubic meters of miscellaneous wood on the island. This not only met the needs of newly built ships in 1958, but also ensured that the repair work of existing fishing boats in 1959 was completed in a timely manner, without delaying seasonal fishing production. Every time the fishing boats returned from the sea, the farmers immediately picked mountain grass to dry their boats. During the summer harvest, fishermen happened to need funds to repair their boats and purchase production materials for going to sea. The agricultural brigades lent them more than 63,000 yuan from the sale of surplus grain. In July 1959, Zhapu built a windbreak harbor, and the agricultural area transferred more than 300 farmers with stone-cutting skills to provide support.

    Farmers also cared for fishermen from the perspective of life. Fishermen always go to sea for dozens of days at a time, and life is very hard. After they returned, the commune Party committee paid great attention to taking care of their lives. Farmers would rather eat less themselves and support fishermen with a large number of non-staple foods such as "three birds" (chickens, ducks, and geese), pigs, peanuts, as well as wine and miscellaneous grains. In addition, the agricultural cooperatives originally did not allow the fishing cooperatives to carry out aquatic product farming on the sea surface along the island, and now a preliminary aquatic product farm has also been run by the commune.

    Industry and Transportation Have Developed

    The development of agriculture and fishery has put forward new requirements for industry and transportation. The agricultural and fishery sectors of Hailing Island have increasingly felt the need to directly control certain industries. This is especially urgent in the fishery sector. Because the tools and equipment for fishery production need to be repaired and supplemented frequently and on a large scale. The original factories and workshops were small in scale and too scattered, making it inconvenient for leadership and insufficiently close in cooperation with agricultural and fishery production, and insufficiently strong in support. In terms of transportation, Hailing Island did not have a single highway, or even a decent road that could be used by bicycles, and transportation was very inconvenient. In terms of external communication, the sea separated it from the mainland, making transportation even more inconvenient. This has become a major obstacle to the further economic development of Hailing Island. After the establishment of the People's Commune, the commune ran industries and transportation, which played a great role in the comprehensive and integrated development of Hailing Island's economy.

    From the establishment of the commune to the end of August 1959, the commune built a building materials factory, an agricultural and sideline product processing factory, a fertilizer factory, and an aquatic product processing factory (the aquatic product processing factory was transferred to become a local state-owned enterprise in April 1959), built a 50-li-long highway that runs across the island, is building a 4,600-meter-long seawall connecting the mainland, organized a transportation brigade and a loading and unloading team, and took over and expanded a shipyard, a fishing net factory, a rope factory, a machinery repair factory, a farm tool factory, a hardware repair factory, and a sewing factory, as well as a construction brigade, a loading and unloading station, a barge team, and a sewing team. In addition, each production brigade also runs brick and tile factories, farm tool repair stations, fertilizer factories, wineries, etc.

    From January to the end of August 1959, the factories directly under the commune produced 25,200 dan of bacterial fertilizer (including the part produced by the aquatic product processing factory when it belonged to the commune), 144,400 dan of high-quality soil fertilizer, more than 86,000 dan of factory fertilizer, more than 56,000 jin of boat nails, more than 2,900 various fishing nets, more than 410,000 jin of hemp rope and rudder rope, more than 648,000 fishing circles and fishing hooks, and four new ships with a total load capacity of 160 tons, repaired 146 ships, etc.

    Productivity Has Greatly Increased

    In this way, the Hailing Commune solved a series of contradictions in the field of production, creating a series of new favorable conditions for the development of productive forces. As a result, productive forces have greatly developed.

    In terms of agricultural production, the most prominent is the increase in rice production. In the late rice crop of 1958, after verification by the commune Party committee, the total rice production was 12.3 million jin, an increase of 61% over the same period in 1957; the average per-mu yield increased by 102% over the same period in 1957. The bumper harvest brought about a major change in the food situation on Hailing Island. The agricultural area no longer needed the state to sell unified grain. In the early rice crop of 1959, the natural conditions were not very good, and it encountered five rainstorms, two strong winds, and one insect disaster. However, thanks to the People's Commune, it still greatly increased production. The total output of the entire commune was more than 8.3 million jin, with an average per-mu yield of 425 jin. Compared with the same period in 1958, the total output increased by 17%, and the average per-mu yield increased by 32.8%. Other crops have also achieved great increases in production.

    On the basis of communization, fishery production in the winter of 1958 also immediately had a leap forward development. In 1959, there was another great leap forward on the basis of the extraordinary bumper harvest in 1958. From September to December 1958, the total fishery output of the entire island (including semi-fishermen and farmers, the same below) was 145,562 dan, an increase of 58% over the same period in 1957; the output value was more than 1.59 million yuan, an increase of 51.6% over the same period in 1957. In the first half of 1959, the total output was more than 217,900 dan, and the total output value was 2,226,890 yuan. Compared with the same period in 1958, the total output increased by 51.5%, and the total output value increased by 25.1% (the increase in the total output value was slower than the total output because in 1959, active production was still carried out in the off-season of fishery production, and some fish with low output value were caught, and these fish were not needed in the past).

    In terms of industry, by the end of August 1959, the total output value of commune-run industries had reached 1.67 million yuan, more than double the same period in 1958. The aquatic product processing factory that was transferred after the establishment of the commune was not included in the calculation.

    In addition, animal husbandry, forestry and other sideline occupations, as well as cultural and educational undertakings, have also developed considerably. Primary school students account for 95% of the total number of children of school age. In addition, the commune also runs a fishery school, an agricultural middle school, an ordinary middle school, and a health school, and has built a new hospital, expanded two hospitals, and has a certain scale of bookstores, cultural centers, maternity hospitals, health stations, theaters, and drama troupes.

    小岛巨变
    记广东阳江县海陵人民公社的各业大发展
    何城　林文山
    海陵岛，这个屹立在广东阳江县南部、方圆九十华里、居住着四万一千二百人的小岛，过去曾经是一个充满灾难和穷困的地方，现在却像一颗晶莹的明珠闪烁着引人注目的光芒。
    解放前，封建地主的压迫和剥削，旱魔的猖獗，台风、海潮的狂袭，使海陵岛的历史充满灾歉、饥饿、死亡的记载。烈日把禾苗晒成枯草，台风将播在地里的种子连同泥沙一起刮走，海涛卷没了庄稼和村庄。……
    现在，这一切都成为过去了！到了海陵岛，一片葱绿、茁壮的禾苗和千百口明镜般的池塘，便呈现在你的眼前。1956年，农民在这里挖了平塘和筑了山塘，并在塘里养了鱼，因此这里如今已是流水潺潺，鱼群欢跃；一条好几米宽的、闪着金光的海堤，直挺挺地正在向北伸延。经过合作化以后的1956年，粮食亩产量达到了五百三十六斤。办起人民公社之后，1958年晚造获得亩产六百多斤的大丰收；1959年早造，虽然有过几次强风暴雨的袭击，亩产仍达四百多斤，如果拿1959年的早造和晚造加起来，就肯定是更要大大超过千斤的了。
    农民的生活大为改善。过去一年只能吃到三顿白米干饭的农民，现在每人每月平均可以吃到三十多斤稻谷，强劳动力还可以吃到六十多斤。现在，稻谷代替了番薯作主粮，干饭代替了稀饭，稠粥代替了那稀得能照见人面的粥水，这是一个多么巨大的变化！
    用水的矛盾解决了
    在那四面被海水包围着的海陵岛上，竟没有一条河流或一个湖泊。过去，全岛四万二千亩耕地中，80％经常遭到旱灾的威胁。旱情严重的时候，吃水也成问题。解放后的头几年，人们在大自然面前仍然是无能为力的。到1956年，党领导全岛农民，在合作化的基础上，解放了地下水，在田垌（阳江等地农民对某一大片田的总称）里挖了一千六百多口平塘，同时修了好些围堤，挡住了海潮的冲袭，才开始制服了为害最烈的旱魔，使全岛农业生产的面貌为之一新。
    可是，经过两年的发展，一些过去没有出现过的矛盾却逐渐冒头了；一些过去虽然存在，但是还挨得过去的矛盾，现在也逐渐显得尖锐起来了。
    在这些矛盾当中，最突出的问题仍然是水。虽然各个合作社都挖了不少平塘和筑了一些山塘；但是，在合作社与合作社之间，水源并不都是很平衡的。有的水源多得用不完，有的却不够用。拿望天垌来说，在那里，有着双丰、那广、丹南三个合作社的田。他们都挖有平塘，但是，水源却数那广丰富，双丰的田仍然有部分没有解除旱灾的威胁。合作社的集体所有制比之小农经济已经大大地开拓了人们的眼界，但是，这毕竟有一定的限度。规模比较狭小的合作社所有制的局限性，开始暴露出来了。
    以前没有水，收成无保证，人们很少感到需要积肥。现在，人们对积肥的兴趣提高了，可是，矛盾也跟着来了。这里最好的肥料是海肥。以前，只有观堂社有积海肥的习惯和经验，现在，别的社也想积海肥，他们就担心人家把好的海肥弄去了。于是，干部发现海肥，悄悄地发动社员出海去采集，甚至要社员晚上出动。
    此外，在良种的互通有无、插花地的合理调整等等问题上，由于小集体的局限性而产生的矛盾也都逐渐地产生和突出起来。所有以上种种矛盾，日益成为继续前进中的绊脚石。
    1958年9月9日，海陵人民公社成立了。一走上这条道路，所有由于小集体的局限性而产生的种种矛盾，都迎刃而解了。在全公社十一个农业大队（原来的高级农业社）之间，原来用水、使用土地方面的矛盾，很快就经过合理的调整得到解决。而且，许多大队还合作修了一些新的、过去修不成的水利工程。
    同样，种苗、肥料等方面的矛盾也解决了。石塘大队的花生种很好，过去是不肯换给别人的，现在按等价交换的原则支援了观堂大队。石塘过去苦于缺乏稻谷良种，现在也得到了别人的帮助。白蒲大队缺乏鹅苗、鸭苗，从双丰、那广、北极等大队得到了支援。此外，各大队也以借贷方式在资金方面互相支援。前些时，观堂大队发现海里有大量肥效很高的“马屎坭”，他们不再像过去那样“保密”了，立刻报告了公社，公社不失时机地动员了一万人下海，三天内便采集了马屎坭二万五千担。
    渔民和农民的关系改善了
    由于扩大了集体所有制的范围，克服了经济单位过于狭小的缺点，人民公社在解决渔业内部的矛盾，促进渔业生产的发展方面，显示了巨大的优越性。在改进渔、农关系，组织渔农大协作方面，人民公社的优越性更加明显。
    闸坡港在海陵岛的西端，住着占全岛人口30％左右的一万二千多居民，主要以渔业为生。在合作化初期，不论从事深海作业的大型渔船，还是从事浅海作业的小型渔船，组织规模都是很小的。1956年，由于生产上的迫切需要，一百多只大船以原来七个初级渔业生产合作社为基础，吸收了单干户，联合起来组织了“海鸥”高级渔业生产合作社。这对促进深海渔业的发展，起了巨大的作用。他们获得了年胜一年的大丰收。但是小船的组织规模仍然很小，四、五只或十来只就是一个社，力量单薄。大小船之间不同类型作业的协作，更难谈得上。大小船之间经济上的差别也就越来越大。1958年初，在大跃进中几百只小船便全部合并成为一个大型的“小海鸥社”。这个大社一经建立，就建造了一批中型渔船，到原来小船不能去、而大船则很少到那里活动的“中海”（深海和浅海之间的海面）去进行生产，开发那一地带的丰富资源。这是渔业生产上的一大进步。可是，新的困难、新的矛盾也随着出现了。
    “小海鸥社”在中海作业方面，经验缺乏，技术力量薄弱，设备和工具也不足，因此产量很低。而且当时陆地上只有“大海鸥社”的渔民家属定居，“小海鸥社”的渔民家属则大都住在船上，因而不能利用陆地来进行修补工具等活动。这些都要求“大海鸥社”给予有力的支援。当然，“大海鸥社”在许多方面也要“小海鸥社”的协助。但是由于大、小“海鸥社”是完全独立的两个经济单位，种种互助协作的活动，做起来不那么顺利。
    原来，岛上的农民同渔民之间，关系不怎么好。解放前，农民和渔民本来都受反动统治阶级的压迫和剥削，不幸的命运是相同的。国民党反动派为了加强控制，设在这里的“党部”、特务和反动武装特别多，他们勾结了当地封建势力，使得农民和渔民的苦难更加深重。同时，他们在农民和渔民之间进行挑拨、分裂，因而造成了农民和渔民之间、闸坡港和农业区之间严重的不和。他们曾经打过大架，出过人命案。农民不卖柴草给渔民烘船；渔民也不卖鱼给农民吃。解放以后，人们的觉悟提高了，关系有了改善。合作化后，相互间也有一些支援。渔民和渔民家属在农忙时帮农民插秧、抗旱，农民也时常帮渔民打线、结网、晒鱼、拣鱼。但是，由于大家不是一个统一的行政单位（闸坡是一个区级镇，海陵农业区另外设一个区，后来改成乡），彼此之间的关系还不够密切，在生产上也存在许多矛盾；加上历史上遗留下来的盲目宗派情绪还没有彻底肃清，更使双方在处理问题有时引起一些纠纷。在党委和各合作社的领导干部中，已经有许多人逐渐感觉到这种矛盾同经济单位过于狭小有关。因而有人开始议论：“除非闸坡和海陵合成一个大合作社，矛盾就没法解决！”只是那时候，大家思想还不够解放，还没有足够的勇气认真地来考虑这样的问题。
    大跃进的形势逼使人们再也不能这样对待问题了。恰好又是党中央和毛主席提出的人民公社化的号召，回答了这个问题。原来全岛合办一个大社，并不是什么空想，而正是唯一的现实的出路，是一条光明大道。于是党委会领导全岛人民成立了一个统一的人民公社，同时，还大规模地组织了渔民和农民互相访问，进行“农渔一家亲”的教育。从这时起，渔民和农民就经常在生产上、生活上互相照顾，他们的互助协作，使许多过去做不到甚至想不到的事情都做到了。
    在生产上，渔民在许多方面给农民以巨大的支援。过去，渔民捕到不能吃或者不值钱的鱼类，都是倒回海里去的。公社化后，为了支援农业生产，他们将这些鱼类都收集起来。每次由海里回来，一只船就带着四、五十担鱼肥，使公社的肥料厂得到源源不断的原料。农业大队到闸坡去积肥，都得到闸坡的渔民家属的支持。公社化后不久，渔民家属在一次运动中就为农民下海积了螺仔肥和海泥肥二十八万多担。1958年冬天深翻改土和1959年夏收夏种中，渔民、渔民家属支援了农业生产两万多个劳动日。1959年春耕时，正是渔业生产的旺季，渔业大队借给农业大队十九万多元的开耕费。
    渔民还给半渔农以设备和工具方面的支援。捕鱼是有季节性的，可以到深海捕鱼的季节，大渔船就不会到浅海去捕鱼。而半渔农则较多地在浅海生产。过去，半渔农资金不足，装备残缺。现在，渔民可以将自己暂时用不上的工具借给半渔农使用。公社化后，闸坡就这样借给半渔农一千一百多张胶丝刺网、三十七条渔船和其他大批工具。这一切就大大增强了半渔农的生产力量。
    农民也同样给渔民以支援。1958年闸坡大搞渔业的基本建设，需要许多材料。当他们缺乏木材装船和修船的时候，公社组织了四百多农民到阳春县圭岗山区采伐并运回杉材二千多立方米，在本岛伐运了杂木一百五十立方米。这不仅满足了1958年新建船只的需要，而且还保证了1959年原有渔船的修理工作及时完成，不误季节地出海生产。每次渔船从海里回来，农民马上就挑山草给他们烘船。夏收时，渔民正好需要资金修船和购买下海用的生产资料。各农业大队便将卖余粮所得的六万三千多元借给他们。1959年7月，闸坡修筑避风塘，农业区调了三百多个有打石技术的农民去支援。
    农民还从生活方面来关怀渔民。渔民每次出海总得好几十天，生活非常艰苦。他们回来后，公社党委很注意照顾他们的生活。农民宁可自己少吃一些，将大批副食品如“三鸟”（鸡、鸭、鹅，下同）、猪、花生以及酒和杂粮等支援渔民。此外，原来农业社不答应渔业社在沿岛海面进行水产养殖，现在一个初具规模的水产养殖场也由公社举办起来了。
      工业和交通事业发展了
    农业和渔业的发展，对工业和交通运输事业提出了新的要求。海陵岛的农业和渔业部门，都日益感到了自己直接掌握某些工业的必要。这在渔业方面尤其迫切。因为渔业生产的工具和设备，需要经常地大规模地修理和补充。原来的一些工厂和工场，规模小，而且太分散，领导不便，对渔业和农业生产的配合不够紧密，支援不够有力。在交通方面，海陵岛没有一条公路，甚至没有像样的、能走自行车的大路，交通很不方便；从对外联系来说，海水又把它同大陆隔开，交通更加不便。这已经成为海陵岛经济进一步发展的重大障碍。人民公社成立以后，公社办工业又办交通运输事业，对海陵岛经济的全面综合发展，起了很大的作用。
    从公社成立到1959年8月底，公社共新建了建筑材料厂、农副产品加工厂、肥料厂、水产加工厂各一个（水产加工厂已于1959年4月上调，改为地方国营企业），修建了一条长达五十华里、横贯全岛的公路，正在修建一条长达四千六百多米、连接大陆的海堤，组织了运输大队、搬运组各一个，接管和扩建了造船厂、鱼网厂、绳缆厂、机械修理厂、农具厂、五金修理厂、缝纫厂各一个，建筑大队、搬运站、驳船队、缝纫组各一个。此外，各生产大队还办有砖瓦厂、农具修配站、化肥厂、酒厂等等。
    1959年1月到8月底，公社直属的工厂就生产了细菌肥二万五千二百担（包括水产加工厂属公社时期所生产的部分），优质土化肥十四万四千四百担，厂肥八万六千多担，船钉五万六千多斤，各种渔网二千九百多张，麻缆、笏缆四十一万多斤，渔圈、渔钓六十四万八千余只，载重量共达一百六十吨的新船四只，修船一百四十六只，等等。
        生产力大大提高了
    海陵公社就是这样地在生产的领域内解决了一系列的矛盾，给生产力的发展创造了一系列新的有利条件。于是，生产力就有了很大发展。
    农业生产方面，最突出的是稻谷的增产。1958年晚造，经公社党委核实，稻谷总产量是一千二百三十万斤，比1957年同期增长61％；平均亩产量比1957年同期增长102％。大丰收使得海陵岛的粮食情况起了重大的变化。农业区再也不要国家统销粮食了。1959年早造，自然条件不大好，碰到过五次暴雨，两次强风，一次虫灾，但是，由于有了人民公社，仍然大大增产。全公社总产量八百三十万余斤，平均亩产四百二十五斤，同1958年同期相比，总产量增加17％，平均亩产量增加32．8％。别的作物也同样得到很大的增产。
    在公社化的基础上，1958年冬季的渔业生产也立刻有了飞跃发展。1959年，又在1958年特大丰收的基础上再次大跃进。1958年9月到12月底，全岛渔业（包括半渔农，下同）总产量为十四万五千五百六十二担，比1957年同期增长58％；产值一百五十九万余元，比1957年同期增长51．6％。1959年上半年总产量二十一万七千九百余担，总产值二百二十二万六千八百九十元，同1958年同期对比，总产量增加51．5％，总产值增加25．1％（总产值的增加速度比总产量慢，是因为1959年在渔产淡季仍积极生产，捕了一些产值不高的鱼类，而这些鱼过去都是不要的）。
    工业方面，到1959年8月底为止，社办工业的总产值就已经达到一百六十七万元，比1958年同期增长了一倍多。由公社建立以后上调的水产加工厂还未计算在内。
    此外，畜牧业、林业及其他副业，以及文化教育事业都有了相当大的发展。小学生占适龄儿童总数的95％。另外，公社还办了水产学校、农业中学、普通中学、卫生学校各一所，新建医院一所，扩建医院二所，书店、文化馆、妇产院、保健站、戏院、剧团等也有了一定的规模。
