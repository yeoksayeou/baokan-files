Anhui, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Heilongjiang Spring Plowing Preparations Unprecedentedly Good
Most water conservancy projects completed, accelerating land leveling and expanding irrigation area; large quantity and high quality of accumulated fertilizer, far exceeding last year; improved varieties basically prepared; farm tools continue to be manufactured; the garden-style movement centered on high-yield plots is rapidly advancing

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, February 25th: Spring sowing preparations and field management of summer harvest crops are progressing simultaneously in Anhui. The joyous spring production is spreading across the north and south of the Yangtze River and both banks of the Huai River.

Relying on the great superiority of the people's communes and utilizing the natural conditions most suitable for crop growth in spring while avoiding droughts and floods, vigorously expanding the planting of spring-sown crops is the biggest feature of this year's spring plowing production in Anhui Province. This year, the planned sowing area for spring-sown crops in the province is more than 60% larger than last year, which had the largest area of spring-sown crops. The large spring sowing task and high quality requirements have prompted early and vigorous preparations in various places, ahead of the season. On the basis of the universal plowing of spring land last winter, another 6.44 million mu have been spring plowed and harrowed. Reclaimed land has reached 6.5 million mu. The 110 million jin of improved varieties of rice, corn, and other crops needed for spring sowing are about to be completely allocated. In the old rice-growing areas along the Yangtze River and the new rice-growing areas in the Huaihe Plain, rice seedling fields have already been selected. In Wuhu Prefecture, where the season is early, more than 2 million jin of rice seeds have already been soaked. Sweet potato seedling cultivation has also started earlier than in previous years, with more than 350,000 warm beds built throughout the province, and more than 330 million jin of sweet potato seedlings planted, more than ten times more than last year. In order to adapt to the expanded area of spring-sown crops, various places are rushing to build water conservancy projects that will benefit this year but have not yet been completed. The more than 280,000 large and small water conservancy projects that have been completed, plus the original water conservancy projects, have a storage capacity of 7 billion cubic meters, which can meet the water needs of spring sowing and summer harvest crops. The spring fertilizer accumulation movement, focusing on pig raising and combining raising, planting, and fertilizer production, is in full swing. At present, nearly 10 billion dan of base fertilizer have been prepared for spring-sown crops, and great achievements have also been made in the basic construction of fertilizer accumulation. More than 10 million manure pits have been dug in the fields alone.

This year, the area of summer harvest crops in the province has been expanded by more than 30% compared to last year. Wheat and rapeseed are currently growing very well. In order to universally increase yield per unit area, various places have launched a "four-drive field management movement: making distant fields catch up with nearby fields, poor fields catch up with fertile fields, late wheat catch up with early wheat, and third-class seedlings catch up with first-class seedlings."

The technical innovation movement vigorously carried out in various places, centered on tool reform, has accelerated the progress of various production activities. For example, in water management work, which requires a lot of labor, the average daily work efficiency per person has reached about 12 cubic meters, about three times higher than the average work efficiency in the previous water conservancy construction year, due to the creation and imitation of more than 2.5 million advanced water management tools. A total of more than 2 million laborers have been saved from the water conservancy front, strengthening other spring production activities. The technical innovation movement, led by the water conservancy aspect, has now been extended to various spring production activities. By mid-February, the province had added and reformed more than 500,000 pieces of fertilizer accumulation and transportation tools, agricultural transportation tools, deep plows, improved harrows, and field management tools.

Shanxi

People's Daily, Taiyuan, February 26th: Shanxi Province's comprehensive spring plowing movement, with water and fertilizer as the commander and high-yield plots as the center, has entered the final decisive stage.

The progress of spring plowing preparations in Shanxi Province is about a month earlier than in previous years.

The people's communes throughout the province have fully utilized their superior conditions in overall planning and rational deployment, guaranteeing that the battle to seize time on the water conservancy front, rushing construction periods, and rushing spring irrigation has achieved brilliant results. Sixty-nine large and medium-sized water conservancy projects have completed more than 30 million cubic meters of earthwork; more than 85,000 small water conservancy projects centered on reservoirs and wells have been completed. The loudest slogan in various places during spring plowing preparations is "Take three steps as one, four steps as one." Under the slogan of "Rushing spring irrigation and completing work early," Wenxi County completed a large number of water conservancy projects ahead of schedule. The county expanded the area of irrigated land by 105,000 mu, and more than 86,000 mu have already been spring irrigated. Due to the early completion of a large number of water conservancy projects and ensuring that reservoirs are completed and canals are open, 5.66 million mu of land throughout the province have been spring irrigated once.

The fertilizer accumulation and production movement centered on pig raising throughout the province is also progressing rapidly. So far, the province has basically completed the fertilizer accumulation plan, with an average application of nearly 100 dan of fertilizer per mu of cultivated land, and fertilizers with relatively good quality such as human and animal manure and composted fertilizer account for more than 60%.

Although the universal plowing of autumn fields was completed last year, and more than 25 million mu were deep plowed more than six inches deep, Jinan Prefecture, the main cotton-producing area, is still vigorously promoting the garden-style movement. In the whole area, 50% of the 3.3 million mu of cotton fields have been deep plowed more than eight inches twice. The garden-style area in the province reaches more than 6.02 million mu, an increase of more than 2 million mu compared to the Great Leap Forward in 1958.

Preparations for improved varieties have also been largely completed.

With the deepening of the mass movement, the scale of high-yield plots in the province this year is even larger. Jinan Prefecture mobilized millions of commune members to vigorously develop high-yield plots. In just 20 days, more than 6,500 garden plots, high-yield plots, high-yield walls, high-yield rivers, high-yield ditches, and high-yield ridges were established on 4 million mu of farmland. On average, 200,000 mu of land were rebuilt every day. The result of building a large number of high-yield plots is that the irrational farming systems and settings of small-scale peasant economy remnants, such as fragmented plots, excessive ridges, unevenness, and winding roads, have been completely eliminated, forming the farming system and settings of socialist large-scale production.

All high-yield plots are established with water, fertilizer, and soil as the center. Jinan Prefecture has universally implemented "three circles to the fields." More than 3,500 new pig farms have been built in the high-yield plots, raising more than 300,000 pigs; more than 5,000 field sheep pens have been established, raising more than 400,000 sheep; and more than 2,500 large livestock pens have been established, raising more than 40,000 large livestock. In addition, more than 20,000 toilets have also been built. Southeast Shanxi Prefecture also implemented "building pig farms in every plot." In more than half a month, 2,338 10,000-pig farms were built along with the plots, and more than 80,000 new pigsties were built. With the establishment of high-yield plots, Jinan Prefecture also combined road repairs and the establishment of forestry and fertilizer bases, and newly opened more than 10,000 large and small canals, universally leveled the land, and completed more than 50 million cubic meters of earthwork. In the large-scale construction of high-yield plots, all localities have made comprehensive arrangements for labor and animal power for spring plowing and sowing.

At present, Shanxi's spring plowing preparations are fiercely attacking the high-standard pass, ensuring that high-yield plots are universally completed before the start of spring plowing and sowing, most water conservancy projects are completed, fertilizers are abundant and of good quality, land is leveled, tools are complete, livestock are fat and strong, and seeds are full.

Inner Mongolia

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, February 26th: Farmers of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are stepping up their spring plowing activities. This year, the spring plowing activities of people's communes in both agricultural areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas are more vigorous, start earlier, and have a higher labor attendance rate than in previous years. The attendance rate of commune members in Ulanqab League and Zhaowuda League reached 90% and 95% respectively.

More fertilizer, better quality, and earlier fertilizer delivery are the significant characteristics of this year's spring plowing production in Inner Mongolia. At present, more than 290 billion jin of fertilizer have been accumulated in the region, more than 60 billion jin more than the total amount of fertilizer applied last year, and human and animal manure accounts for 60% of the fertilizer. In addition, more than 4,000 local chemical fertilizer plants have been established, producing 290 million jin of various local chemical fertilizers. At present, more than 130 billion jin of fertilizer have been delivered to the fields in the region. In order to accelerate the progress of fertilizer delivery, many areas have also launched a tool reform movement. Laicheng People's Commune in Kailu County has achieved "soil baskets on trucks, dumping of trucks," increasing efficiency by more than two times. After the dead board on the bottom of the truck was changed to a live board in the Taibus Banner of Xilin Gol League, the fertilizer transportation efficiency increased by 50%.

The momentum of water conservancy construction in the region this year is also very strong. Since last winter and this spring, more than 5,500 medium-sized and small water conservancy projects have been completed in the region, and more than 11,000 are under construction. At present, the various water conservancy projects that have been built can expand the irrigated area by 1.87 million mu, equivalent to twice the area benefited by water conservancy projects in the entire year of 1959. At present, the region is actively carrying out water conservancy project matching and water storage and conservation work, striving for these projects to play a greater role. In the Hetao area of ​​Bayan Nur League, more than 8,000 field canals have been excavated and repaired, and 200,000 embankments have been built. Helingeer, Liangcheng, Zhuozi, and Tumote banners in Ulanqab League are also actively excavating field irrigation projects. In order to conserve moisture, the region has also carried out rolling and pressing work. At present, the land that has been rolled and pressed in various places accounts for more than 30% of the land ploughed in autumn last year, and the area of ​​soil and water conservation has reached more than 2,000 square kilometers.

Liaoning

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 25th: The situation of Liaoning Province's agricultural front continuing to leap forward in an all-round way with grain as the key link is very good. With the support of powerful industrial cities, the spring plowing upsurge in the province's rural people's communes is unfolding in a lively manner.

The spring plowing upsurge is a continuous development of the winter production upsurge. Since October last year, the winter production in the province, centered on water, fertilizer, and soil, has made great achievements. According to statistics on February 16, the province has repaired more than 28,300 various water conservancy projects such as reservoirs, ponds, deep wells, and water diversion canals, and the completed earth and stone work is equivalent to 3.6 times that of the same period last year. The average amount of household fertilizer accumulated in the province, calculated by cultivated land, has increased by more than 20% compared to the amount of fertilizer applied during spring sowing last year, and 60% of it has been delivered to the fields, and the progress of fertilizer delivery has been accelerated by two times compared to the same period last year. On the basis of turning over 39 million mu of land in the autumn of last year, various localities have also adopted the method of "turning over one piece after another, pressing one layer after another" to start preparing the land and conserving moisture early. In conjunction with land preparation, various localities are actively carrying out large-scale soil improvement work. The province has selected and retained more than 800 million jin of various crop seeds, and has generally started germination tests. The repair, manufacturing, and technical training of spring plowing and spring sowing farm tools are also being stepped up.

The vigorous industrial support for agriculture and the people's communes' large-scale tool reform have created unprecedentedly favorable conditions for agriculture to improve labor productivity and expand reproduction. At present, factories and mining enterprises in various cities, under the unified planning and leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, have successively linked up with people's communes to establish support relationships, supporting various materials and equipment such as steel, machine tools, and tools, and helping the people's communes establish and enrich agricultural machinery repair and assembly plants, and doing everything possible to arm agriculture with advanced technology. In addition, according to preliminary statistics from ten cities including Shenyang, Anshan, and Fuxin, more than 3,000 cadres and technicians have gone to the countryside to help the people's communes repair spring plowing and spring sowing agricultural machinery and drainage and irrigation machinery. The tool reform movement in the people's communes in various places is most prominent in the reform of water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation and delivery tools. More than 100 kinds of water conservancy construction tools have been created and reformed in various places, and more than 350,000 pieces have been promoted, making the water management efficiency in the province more than doubled compared to the beginning of last winter. The large-scale reform of fertilizer transportation tools has accelerated the progress of fertilizer delivery.

Heilongjiang

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, February 26th: The people's communes in various parts of Heilongjiang Province are carrying out spring plowing preparations in a good, fast, and comprehensive manner, focusing on water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation and transportation.

At present, the ice and snow in Heilongjiang Province have not yet melted, and various water conservancy construction sites continue to carry out high-efficiency water conservancy construction competitions, striving to complete projects that can be effective before the flood season this year ahead of schedule. Several counties that are prone to spring drought, such as Longjiang, Gannan, and Anda, where the construction progress is faster, have begun to use newly built water conservancy projects to winter irrigate farmland on a large scale. The province's fertilizer accumulation plan has been basically completed, and the proportion of fine fertilizer this year has increased from less than 30% in previous years to half. In addition, more than 3,800 local and foreign chemical fertilizer plants in the province have produced 4.5 billion jin of various chemical fertilizers. The reserves of various crop seeds can basically meet the needs, and they are all high-quality seeds that have been systematically cultivated and strictly selected. They are now generally undergoing fine selection and germination tests. Nearly half of the farmland planned to be sown this year was autumn plowed before the freezing last year with tractors and new-style animal-drawn farm tools, and some people's communes have now begun to prepare the land.

Various places have also reformed and created farming tools, etc. The Wuchang County cloth-made fine selection machine is fourteen times more efficient than manual selection of soybean seeds; the seeds can germinate in three days in the lamp-style germination box, which is more than half the time shorter than the previous germination test. The reform of canteen cooking utensils and feed chopping tools in Mishan County has been promoted in the people's communes in the county, freeing up 9,000 laborers from the canteen and breeders to participate in spring plowing preparations.

    贯彻以粮为纲方针　发挥公社巨大威力
    安徽  山西  内蒙古  辽宁  黑龙江春耕准备工作空前良好
    水利工程大部竣工，正加快平田整地扩大灌溉面积；积肥数量大质量好，远远超过去年；良种大体备妥；农具继续赶造；以丰产方为中心的园田化运动迅速向前发展	安徽
    新华社合肥25日电　安徽各地春播准备工作和夏收作物田间管理工作齐头并进。欢腾的春季生产闹遍长江南北和淮河两岸。
    依靠人民公社的巨大优越性，利用春季最适宜农作物生长、又能避开旱涝灾害的自然条件，大力扩种春播作物，是今年安徽省春耕生产中的最大特点。今年全省春播作物播种面积计划比春播作物最多的去年扩大60％以上。春播任务大、要求质量高，这就促使了各地的备耕工作早干大干，走在季节前头。全省春地在去冬已经普遍耕过的基础上，又有六百四十多万亩进行了春耕春耙。开荒面积已达六百五十多万亩。春播需要的一亿一千多万斤水稻、玉米等良种，即将调剂结束。沿江两岸的老稻区和淮北平原的新稻区，秧田都已经选好。季节早的芜湖专区，已经泡下稻种两百多万斤。甘薯育苗也比往年提早开始，全省已建温床三十五万多个，已下薯种三亿三千多万斤，比去年多了十倍有余。为了适应春播作物面积扩大的情况，各地正在突击兴修今年受益尚未完工的水利工程。已经完工的二十八万多处大小水利工程，加上原有水利工程，蓄水量达七十亿立方米，已能满足春种和夏收作物用水的需要。以养猪为主，养种积制相结合的春季积肥运动，正在热火朝天地进行。目前已为春播作物准备了近一百亿担基肥，积肥的基本建设也取得很大成绩，仅田头粪窖就开挖了一千多万个。
    今年全省夏收作物面积比去年扩大了30％以上。小麦、油菜目前都长得很好。为了普遍提高单位面积产量，各地开展了“远田赶近田，薄田赶肥田，晚麦赶早麦，三类苗赶一类苗”的四赶田间管理运动。
    各地大力开展的以工具改革为中心的技术革新运动，加快了各项生产的进度。如花费劳动力较多的治水工作，由于创制和仿制了各种先进治水工具二百五十多万件，每人每天平均工效达到了十二立方米左右，比上一个水利兴修年度的平均工效提高三倍左右。全省共由水利战线上节省出两百多万个劳动力，加强了其他各项春季生产。由水利方面领先掀起的技术革新运动，现已扩展到各项春季生产中。到2月中旬，全省新增和改革的积肥运肥工具、农业运输工具、深耕犁、改良耙和田间管理工具共有五十多万件。	山西
    本报太原26日电　山西省以水肥为帅、以丰产方为中心的全面备耕运动，已经进入最后决战阶段。
    山西省春耕准备工作的进度比往年提早了一个月左右。
    全省人民公社充分发挥了统筹安排、合理调度方面的优越条件，保证水利战线上的赶工期，赶春浇的争夺时间的战斗，取得了辉煌的战果。六十九项大中型水利工程，已经完成三千多万土方；以水库、水井为中心的小型水利工程已经完成了八万五千多件。全省新增加灌溉面积四百零三万亩，其中二百零九万亩是保证水地。各地在春耕准备工作中最响亮的口号是“三步并一步，四步并一步。”闻喜县在
  “赶春浇早完工”的口号下，大批水利工程提前完工。全县扩大水地面积十万五千亩，已经有八万六千多亩进行了春浇。由于大量的水利工程提前完成，并作到库成渠通，全省已经有五百六十六万亩地春浇了一次。
    全省以养猪为中心的积肥造肥运动进展也很快。到目前为止，全省基本上完成了积肥计划，每亩耕地平均施肥近百担，人畜粪、沤制肥等质量比较好的肥料占到60％以上。
    秋田的普耕工作虽然在去年已经完成了，并且有二千五百多万亩深耕六寸以上。但是，像主要产棉区的晋南专区，还在大闹园田化运动。全区三百三十万亩棉田二次深耕八寸以上的就有50％。全省园田化面积达六百零二万多亩，比大跃进的1958年增加了二百多万亩。
    优种的准备工作也已大体就绪。
    随着群众运动步步深入，今年全省丰产方规模更大。晋南专区动员了百万社员，大搞丰产方，仅仅二十天就在四百万亩农田上建立了六千五百多个园田方、丰产方、丰产垣、丰产川、丰产沟和丰产梁，平均每天有二十万亩土地经过改建。晋东南专区大干半个多月，全区也建立了一百多万亩丰产方。大建丰产方的结果，小农经济残留的地块零碎、垅畔过多、凸凹不平、道路弯曲等生产过程不合理的耕作制度和设置被彻底消灭了，形成了社会主义大生产的耕作制度和设置。
    所有丰产方都是以水、肥、土为中心建立的。晋南专区普遍实行了“三圈到田”，全区在丰产方内新建猪场三千五百多个，养猪达三十多万头；建立田间羊圈五千多个，养羊四十多万只；建立了大牲畜圈二千五百多个，养大牲畜四万多头。此外，还建立了两万多个厕所。晋东南专区也实行了“方方建猪场”。半个多月来，随方建立了万头猪场二千三百三十八个，新建猪圈八万多间。随着丰产方的建立，晋南专区还结合整修道路、建立林业和肥料基地，共新开了大、小水渠一万多条，普遍平整了土地，共做土方五千余万方。各地在大建丰产方中，对春耕播种的劳力、畜力都作了全面安排。
    目前，山西的备耕工作正在猛攻高标准关，保证在春耕播种开始前普遍建成丰产方，大部水利工程完工，肥料又多又好，土地平整、工具齐全、牲畜肥壮、种籽饱满。	内蒙古
    新华社呼和浩特26日电　内蒙古自治区各族农民加紧进行备耕活动。今年，不论农业区和半农半牧区人民公社的备耕活动都比往年声势大、行动早，劳动出勤率也普遍提高。乌兰察布盟和昭乌达盟等地的社员备耕出勤率分别达到90％和95％。
    积肥多、质量好、送粪早，是今年内蒙古备耕生产的显著特点。现在全区已积下肥料二千九百多亿斤，比去年全年施肥量多六百多亿斤，肥料中的人畜粪占60％。另外，还建立了四千多个土化肥厂，生产各种土化肥二亿九千万斤。现在，全区已经送到田里的肥料已有一千三百多亿斤，不少地区为了加速送肥工作进度，还开展了工具改革运动。开鲁县来城人民公社实现了“装车土篮化，卸车翻斗化”，提高工效二倍多。锡林郭勒太仆寺旗把车底板的死板改成活板后，运肥工效提高了50％。
    今年全区水利建设的声势也很大。去冬今春以来，全区已经有五千五百多项中小型水利工程竣工，另外，还有一万一千多项正在紧张施工。目前，已经修建成的各种水利工程，可以扩大灌溉面积一百八十七万亩，相当于1959年全年水利工程受益面积的两倍。现在，全区正在积极进行水利工程配套和蓄水保水工作，争取这些工程能发挥更大的作用。巴彦淖尔盟河套地区已开挖和整修田间渠道八千多条，打埝二十万道。乌兰察布盟的和林格尔、凉城、卓资及土默特等旗也在积极开挖田间灌溉工程。为了保墒，全区还进行了磙地和压碾工作，现在各地经过磙压的土地已占去年秋翻地的30％以上，水土保持面积达到二千多平方公里。	辽宁
    新华社沈阳25日电　辽宁省农业战线上以粮为纲继续全面跃进的形势很好。在强大工业城市的支援下，全省农村人民公社春季备耕高潮正在热气腾腾地展开。
    备耕高潮是冬季生产高潮的持续发展。从去年10月开始，全省以水、肥、土为中心的冬季生产已经取得很大成绩。到2月16日统计，全省已经修好水库、塘坝、深井、引水渠道等各种水利工程两万八千三百多处，完成的土石方相当于去年同期的三点六倍。全省已积的农家肥料，按耕地计算，平均每亩比去年春播的施肥量增加20％以上，其中的60％已经送到田里，送肥进度比去年同期加快两倍。各地在去年秋翻土地三千九百万亩的基础上，又采取“化一块翻一块，化一层压一层”的办法，提早开始整地保墒。结合整地，各地正在积极进行大规模的土壤改良工作。全省已选留各种作物种子八亿多斤，并已普遍开始发芽试验。春耕春播农具的检修、制造和技术训练工作，也在加紧进行中。
    工业大力支援农业和人民公社大搞工具改革，为农业提高劳动生产率和扩大再生产创造了空前有利的条件。目前，各个城市的厂矿企业在省委统一规划和领导下，纷纷同人民公社挂钩，建立支援关系，支援钢材、机床、工具等各种物资设备，帮助各人民公社建立和充实农业机械修配厂，千方百计以先进的技术武装农业。另外，据沈阳、鞍山、阜新等十个市的初步统计，还有三千多名干部和技术人员下乡，帮助人民公社检修春耕春播农业机具和排灌机械。各地人民公社的工具改革运动，以水利施工和积肥送粪工具的改革成绩最为突出。各地创造和改制成功的水利施工工具有一百多种，已推广三十五万多件，使全省治水工效比去冬开始时提高了一倍多。运肥工具的大量改革，加快了送粪进度。	黑龙江
    新华社哈尔滨26日电　黑龙江省各地人民公社正以兴修水利、积肥运肥为中心，又好又快又全面地进行春耕准备工作。
    目前黑龙江省冰雪尚未溶化，各水利工地继续开展水利施工高工效竞赛运动，力争今年汛前能够发挥效益的工程提前完工。施工进度较快的龙江、甘南、安达等易遭春旱的几个县，已经开始利用新建成的水利工程大面积地冬灌农田。全省积肥计划已经基本完成，今年细肥比重已由往年不到30％增加到一半。另外，全省三千八百多处土、洋化肥厂，已生产了各种化肥四十五亿斤。各种作物种子的储备，基本上能满足需要，而且都是经过系统培育、严格挑选的优良种子，现在正在普遍进行精选和发芽试验。今年计划播种的农田，将近一半在去年结冻前用拖拉机、新式畜力农具进行了秋耕，部分人民公社现在已经开始整地。
    各地对耕作工具等也进行了改革和创造。五常县布制的精选机，选大豆种子比人工挑的效率高十四倍；种子放进灯式试芽箱三天就能够出芽，比以前发芽试验的时间缩短了一半还多。密山县改革的食堂炊具和切碎饲料的工具在全县人民公社推广后，从食堂和饲养员中腾出了九千名劳动力，参加了备耕。（附图片）
