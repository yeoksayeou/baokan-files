Xinjiang is Expanding Cultivated Land
Continuing to Reclaim Wasteland, Level Land, and Improve Soil

(Reported by our newspaper) Various regions in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are combining preparations for spring planting with reclaiming wasteland, leveling land, and improving soil to fully utilize the land's potential and ensure high yields this year. According to preliminary statistics from the agricultural departments, various regions have already reclaimed 350,000 mu of wasteland, leveled over 3 million mu of land, and deeply plowed and improved over 9 million mu of soil for spring planting. With just over a month left before spring planting, the movement to reclaim wasteland and create fields is still being carried out with urgency. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps' military reclamation farms, distributed across the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, have already reclaimed over 1.2 million mu of new wasteland for spring planting. Now, tens of thousands of strong men and women are fighting in the Gobi Desert, determined to reclaim another 2.5 million mu of wasteland before spring planting.

Yuepu Lake, Shache, Moyu, Pishan and other counties are using 20% to 40% of their labor force to make a concentrated effort to level the land, striving to basically complete the leveling of cultivated land before spring plowing.

While vigorously leveling land, various regions, in conjunction with water conservancy projects, have also launched an unprecedented movement to improve saline-alkali soil. In many areas with high salt-alkali content and high groundwater levels, large alkali drainage ditches and alkali drainage networks have been dug. Many communes have already realized the networking of alkali drainage ditches.

    新疆扩大耕地
    继续开荒造田，平整土地改良土壤
    本报讯　新疆维吾尔自治区各地，正结合备耕生产，开荒造田，平整土地，改良土壤，充分发挥土地潜力。保证今年多种高产多收。据农业部门初步统计，各地已为春播开垦出荒地三十五万亩、平整土地三百多万亩、深翻改良土壤九百多万亩。现在，距离春播还有一个来月光景，开荒造田运动仍抓紧在进行。新疆生产建设兵团分布在天山南北的各军垦农场，已为春播开出一百二十多万亩新荒地。现在上万的健儿正奋战在戈壁荒野，他们决心在春播前再开垦出二百五十万亩荒地。
    岳普湖、莎车、墨玉、皮山等县，正以20％至40％的劳动力，突击平整土地，力争在春耕前，将耕地基本平整完毕。
    大力平整土地的同时，各地还结合水利工程，掀起了规模空前的改良盐碱土壤运动，在许多含盐碱重和地下水位高的地区，大挖土碱沟和排碱网，不少公社已实现了排碱沟网化。
