	Spring Festival
	Jin Zhonghua
	The first spring of the 1960s is infinitely beautiful, and we are welcoming a great spring festival. February 14th, ten years ago, was a day of great historical significance. More than 800 million people have since been more closely united. This has become a huge historical driving force. Today, ten years later, we have seen the rich fruits produced by this huge driving force.
	Thinking back to ten years ago, when the news of Chairman Mao's visit to the Soviet Union came out, it attracted the attention of the whole world! People read Chairman Mao's speech at the Moscow railway station with excitement and emotion: "The important task at present is to consolidate the world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, oppose war provocateurs, consolidate the friendship between the two great powers of China and the Soviet Union, and develop the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people." This was the first good news, foreshadowing the good news of the coming spring. Sure enough, the news of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance was published soon after. It spread like lightning around the world. All progressive mankind cheered for it, while the imperialist reactionaries trembled. People saw that the two giants, China and the Soviet Union, were marching hand in hand on the broad road opened up by the October Revolution. This is another great spring in human history.
	We always remember what Chairman Mao said when he bid farewell to Moscow after the Sino-Soviet alliance was established. He said that the full understanding and deep friendship established between the people of China and the Soviet Union based on their fundamental interests is difficult to describe in words. He declared: "The unity of the people of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, which has been consolidated by the treaty, will be permanent, unbreakable, and no one can separate it. And this kind of unity will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, but also inevitably affect the future of mankind and the victory of world peace and justice."
	The major changes that have taken place in China and the world in the past ten years have fully proved Chairman Mao's historical foresight. The relationship between the people of China and the Soviet Union is closer than that of brothers. We are all members of the socialist international family. Common ideals, common cause, common ideas, and common paths closely unite us. In our traditional words, we are "like-minded and connected by flesh and blood." With the great assistance of the Soviet Union and the hard work of the Chinese people, my country's socialist construction cause has been thriving, showing a scene of a hundred flowers blooming and all trees vying for spring. Now, the Soviet Union has entered the stage of comprehensively carrying out communist construction, and our country is leaping forward at high speed on the road of socialist construction. Other socialist countries are also in high spirits and advancing triumphantly. The prosperity, unity and strength of the entire socialist camp have become the hope and strength of all peace-loving and freedom-seeking people in the world.
	The imperialist reactionaries are very afraid of the unity of socialist countries, especially the unity of China and the Soviet Union. They try every means to sow discord. However, all they can get is failure and disappointment. In the past ten years, when the imperialists imposed blockade and embargo on us, we told them: Our world is very big, and we have widely launched friendly visits and economic exchanges. When the imperialists carried out aggression and provocation against us, we warned them: Socialist countries are not easy to bully. We are united like one person, and we are not allowed to stretch the pig noses of imperialist aggressors into our vegetable gardens. Whenever major international events occur, China, the Soviet Union, and all socialist countries fully adopt a consistent attitude, and do not allow international reactionaries to act rashly. We have seen that in Korea, Indochina, the Middle East, and in the storms in the Taiwan Strait area, the international aggressive forces headed by US imperialism have suffered repeated failures and suffered heavy lessons. The arrogance of the imperialists has been brought down, and the prestige of the paper tiger is increasingly swept away.
	The powerful and invincible Sino-Soviet alliance has become the most powerful guarantee for maintaining peace in the Far East and the world. The whole world has seen what the result was when the American aggressors inserted a knife into Korea, trying to provoke China and the Soviet Union. People still remember that at that time, Truman and MacArthur secretly met and discussed on Wake Island. These two small and arrogant characters, with their thieving hearts, timidly calculated what kind of reaction China and the Soviet Union would provoke if they advanced north. What was the result? It has been written clearly. The people of New China are not to be trifled with. We vigilantly guard the peace of the Far East. The Sino-Soviet alliance is as solid as a rock, and it is a powerful fortress for defending world peace.
	In the drastic changes in the world situation in the past ten years, the infinite vitality of the Sino-Soviet alliance has been proved. Socialism has developed into a powerful world system. In the increasingly strong and united socialist camp, the friendly unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union is a strong core. We not only unite and cooperate, support each other, and promote common prosperity, but also stand completely together, safeguarding the cause of world peace and supporting the struggle of all oppressed nations for independence and freedom. Now, US imperialism is still struggling desperately, on the one hand, it is forced to change its practices and play the conspiracies and tricks of both sides, and on the other hand, it brazenly ignores everything, reviving West German militarism in the West and colluding with Japanese militarists to form an aggressive alliance in the East. Therefore, as the mainstay of the world in defending peace, the Sino-Soviet alliance will surely exert its great power even more in the future.
	The Sino-Soviet alliance is based on the invincible Marxist-Leninist ideology. The unity between socialist countries is a completely new type of international relationship based on proletarian internationalism. The socialist international family is full of the warmth of spring. Therefore, the tenth anniversary of the Sino-Soviet alliance is naturally a great spring festival. Let this spring festival emit greater heat, exert greater power, and bring greater victories to the people of China and the Soviet Union, to the entire socialist camp, and to all peace-loving and progressive mankind!

    春天的节日
    金仲华
    六十年代的第一个春天，春光无限好，我们在迎接着一个伟大的春天的节日。十年前的2月14日，是一个具有重大历史意义的日子。八亿以上的人民，从此更加紧密地结合在一起了。这成了一个巨大的历史动力。在十年后的今天，我们已看到这个巨大动力所产生的丰硕果实了。
    回想十年前，当毛主席访问苏联的消息传出来时，它是多么吸引着全世界的注意啊！人们用兴奋和激动的心情，读着毛主席在莫斯科车站上的讲话：“目前的重要任务，是巩固以苏联为首的世界和平阵线，反对战争挑拨者，巩固中苏两大国家的邦交，和发展中苏人民的友谊。”这是第一个喜讯，它预示着即将带来的春天的好消息。果然，中苏友好同盟互助条约签订的消息不久就发表了。它像闪电一样传遍全世界。全体进步人类为它欢欣鼓舞，而帝国主义反动派则被震动得浑身发抖。人们见到，中苏两个巨人在十月革命所开辟的广阔道路上，携手迈步前进了。这是人类历史上又一个伟大的春天。
    我们一直记着中苏同盟订立后毛主席在告别莫斯科时候说的话。他讲到，中苏两大国人民从根本利益上所建立起来的充分了解与深厚友谊，是难以用言语来形容的。他宣告：“业已经过条约巩固下来的中苏两大国人民的团结将是永久的，不可破坏的，没有人能够分离的。而这种团结，不但必然要影响中苏两大国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到世界和平与正义的胜利。”
    十年来在中国和世界发生的重大变化，完全证明了毛主席的历史性的远见。中苏两国人民之间的关系，比兄弟还要亲。我们都是社会主义国际大家庭的成员。共同的理想，共同的事业，共同的思想，共同的道路，把我们紧密地结合在一起。用我们传统的话来说，我们是“志同道合，血肉相连”的。在苏联的巨大援助与中国人民的辛勤努力下，我国的社会主义建设事业已经欣欣向荣，出现了一片百花竞放，万木争春的景象。现在，苏联已经进入全面开展共产主义建设的阶段，我国正在社会主义建设的大道上高速度跃进，其他社会主义国家也都在意气风发，高歌猛进。整个社会主义阵营的繁荣、团结与强大，成为全世界爱好和平与争取自由的人民的希望和力量。
    帝国主义反动派非常害怕社会主义国家的团结，特别是中苏的团结。它们千方百计地进行挑拨离间。但是，它们所能得到的，只是失败与失望。十年来，当帝国主义者对我们进行封锁禁运的时候，我们告诉它：我们的世界大得很，我们广泛地展开了友好访问和经济往来。当帝国主义者对我们进行侵略挑衅的时候，我们警告它：社会主义国家是不好欺侮的，我们团结得像一个人一样，不许帝国主义侵略者的猪鼻子伸进到我们的菜园里来。每当重大的国际事件发生时，中苏以及所有社会主义国家完全采取了一致的态度，不许国际反动派轻举妄动。我们见到，在朝鲜，在印度支那，在中东，以及在台湾海峡地区的风浪中，以美帝国主义为首的国际侵略势力遭到接连的失败，受到了惨重的教训。帝国主义者的气焰被打下去了，纸老虎的威风日益扫地了。
    强大无敌的中苏同盟，成为维护远东与世界和平的最有力的保证。全世界已经见到，当美国侵略者在朝鲜插进一把刀子，企图向中苏挑衅的时候，它所得到的是什么结果。人们还记得，那时候，杜鲁门和麦克阿瑟在威克岛秘密会商，这两个渺小而狂妄的角色，贼胆心虚地盘算着如果向北进犯，会惹起中苏怎样的反应。结果如何呢？已写得明明白白了。新中国人民是不好惹的，我们警惕地守卫着远东的和平。中苏同盟像磐石一样巩固，它是保卫世界和平的强大堡垒。
    在十年来世界形势的激变中，证明了中苏同盟的无限生命力。社会主义已经发展成为一个强大的世界体系。在日益强大团结的社会主义阵营中间，中苏两国人民的友好团结是一个坚强的核心。我们不仅团结合作，相互支持，促进共同的繁荣，而且完全站在一起，维护着世界和平事业，支持着所有被压迫民族争取独立自由的斗争。现在，美帝国主义还在拚命挣扎，一方面被迫改变做法，玩弄两面手法的阴谋诡计，另方面又悍然不顾一切，在西方复活西德军国主义，在东方勾结日本军国主义者结成侵略性的同盟。因而，作为世界保卫和平的中流砥柱的中苏同盟，在今后必将更加发挥它的巨大威力。
    中苏同盟是建立在战无不胜的马克思列宁主义思想基础上的。社会主义国家间的团结，是一种根据着无产阶级国际主义的完全新型的国际关系。在社会主义国际大家庭中间，充满着春天的温暖。因此，中苏同盟十周年自然是一个伟大的春天的节日。让这个春天的节日发出更大的热力，发挥更大的威力，给中苏两大国的人民，给整个社会主义阵营，给所有爱好和平的进步人类，带来更大的胜利吧！
