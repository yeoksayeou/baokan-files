    An Important Task for Street Party Branches
    Currently, the main issue concerning urban street residents is organizing housewives to participate in social production labor. Therefore, the most important task for urban street party branches is to conduct political and ideological work among them, enabling them to exert greater enthusiasm and creativity, and further participate in and improve their work in industrial production and service sectors.
    Having undergone various political movements and ideological education, urban street women have raised their political awareness and eagerly desire to contribute to socialist construction. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the rapid development of production and construction has also urgently demanded the participation of women in social labor. Over the past two years, under the radiant guidance of the General Line, many urban street residents across the country, especially women engaged in housework, have been quickly organized to participate in industrial construction and service industries. They have demonstrated a spirit of hard work, practical work, and skillful work, starting from scratch, from small to large, and have set off a high tide of the whole people running industry, forming a new atmosphere where everyone participates in social labor and every family lives a collective life. However, women in the past engaged in individual housework and lacked the training of social production and collective labor. At the same time, many housewives have had fewer opportunities for political and ideological education and organizational discipline education than those who have already participated in social labor. Therefore, they have not yet developed the habit of collective labor, and there are still phenomena of arriving late, leaving early, or not being dedicated to their work. Although canteens and childcare organizations have been established accordingly in the streets, they still have many household chores to manage. Especially since they have just left their families, some only see immediate benefits and not long-term benefits, some only see individual benefits and not collective benefits, and some do not see the important significance of street industries and service undertakings for industrial and agricultural production and people's lives, etc. Therefore, when street party organizations organize street residents to participate in production, they must constantly gain an in-depth understanding of their ideological situation, their specific difficulties in work and life, and their various demands. And in light of the characteristics of women, carry out patient and meticulous education and assistance. In the process of vigorously developing street industries and service undertakings, the Hongshunli Party Branch constantly adopts methods such as holding forums, reports, classes at Red and Expert Schools, door-to-door visits, individual talks, and adopting a "one key opens one lock" approach to strengthen meticulous ideological education work, and assist administratively in solving their specific difficulties, enabling women to actively participate in street industries, work contentedly in production, and do their work well, thereby promoting the development of street industries and service undertakings.
    The in-depth and meticulous work carried out by the Hongshunli Party Branch is very important. To do any work well, it is necessary to put politics in command, let ideology lead, and solve specific problems. If street party organizations adopt meticulous and in-depth methods and approaches, focusing on carrying out socialist education centered on the General Line for Socialist Construction; and solve specific ideological and practical problems, it will be possible to make them clearly recognize the glory of labor and the superiority of being organized; clarify the relationship between the individual and the collective, the relationship between current interests and long-term interests. Through continuous production practice, educate them to become a part of the working class with a communist style, so that they can contribute even greater strength in the cause of socialist construction.

    街道党支部的一项重要工作
    目前城市街道的居民问题，基本上是组织家庭妇女参加社会生产劳动的问题。城市街道党支部目前的重要工作，也就是作好她们的政治思想工作，让她们发挥更大的积极性创造性，进一步参加和做好工业生产和服务行业的工作。
    城市街道妇女经过各种政治运动和思想教育，提高了政治觉悟，迫切要求为建设社会主义贡献一份力量。1958年大跃进以来，生产建设的迅速发展，也迫切地要求妇女参加社会劳动。两年来，全国许多城市街道居民，特别是在家中从事家务劳动的妇女，在总路线光辉照耀下，很快组织起来，参加了工业建设和服务事业。她们发挥了苦干实干巧干的精神，从无到有，从小到大，掀起了全民大办工业的高潮。形成人人参加社会劳动，家家都过集体生活的新气象。但是，妇女们过去干的是个体的家务劳动，缺乏社会生产集体劳动的锻炼。同时，不少家庭妇女受政治思想教育和组织纪律教育的机会也还比已经参加社会劳动的人们为少。所以，她们还没有集体劳动的习惯，还有迟到早退或不安心工作的现象。虽然街道上相应地建立了食堂和托儿组织，但是她们仍有不少家务琐事需要料理。尤其是她们刚走出家庭，有的人只看到眼前利益而看不到长远利益，有的人只看到个人利益而看不到集体利益，有的人看不清街道工业和服务事业对于工农业生产和人民生活的重要意义，等等。因此街道党组织在组织街道居民参加生产的时候，就要经常深入了解她们的思想情况，了解她们在工作和生活中存在的具体困难和各种要求。并且针对妇女的特点，进行耐心细致的教育和帮助。鸿顺里的党支部在大办街道工业和服务事业的过程中，不断地采用开座谈会、报告会、红专学校上课、登门拜访、个别谈话以及采取“一把钥匙开一把锁”的方式，加强细致的思想教育工作，并协助行政上解决她们的具体困难，使妇女们积极地参加街道工业，安心地从事生产和做好工作，从而促进了街道工业和服务事业的发展。
    鸿顺里党支部所进行的深入细致的工作是很重要的。要做好任何一项工作，必须政治挂帅，思想先行，解决具体问题。街道党组织采取细致深入的方式和方法，着重进行以社会主义建设总路线为中心的社会主义教育；并解决具体的思想问题和实际问题，就有可能使她们明确认识劳动的光荣和组织起来的优越性；明确个人和集体的关系，目前利益和长远利益的关系。通过不断的生产实践，把她们教育成为具有共产主义风格的工人阶级的一部分，使她们在社会主义建设事业中，贡献出更大的力量。
