(Our newspaper, Nanjing, 1st dispatch) The industrial front of Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, has recently launched a mass movement to advance in the direction of "high, precision, and cutting-edge." All industries, according to their different production characteristics and technical foundations, are vigorously carrying out technical revolution, creating new products, catching up with famous brands, tackling cutting-edge technologies, and scaling new heights. In just over a month, more than 300 new products have appeared in the city, including more than a dozen relatively precision products.

This mass movement is a new development in the city's current technical revolution movement. All industries have clarified their goals based on their own production characteristics and technical conditions. The metallurgical industry in Wuxi City has developed on the basis of "small-scale indigenous groups." This time, their goal is to develop towards the production of various alloy steels and non-ferrous metals on the basis of high yield and high quality. Silicon steel and several non-ferrous metals have recently been trial-produced. The electromechanical industry system will manufacture and trial-produce various precision machine tools, high-horsepower diesel engines, large-diameter water pumps, advanced telecommunications equipment, and precision instruments. The textile industry system will manufacture high-grade cotton, wool, and silk textiles, and test and apply new technologies such as electrostatic spinning, high-speed weaving, automatic silk reeling, and vacuum cocoon boiling in production. The light chemical industry system will produce a large number of daily-use industrial products and important chemical raw materials that catch up with famous brands. While planning, they actively cooperate closely with scientific research departments and schools to carry out research and trial production work. Many new products are put into production immediately after successful trial production.

In the march towards new technologies, the workers of large factories with better production technology conditions have ambitiously put forward the slogan "Better on top of better, reaching new heights." The Wuxi Machine Tool Factory produced a high-frequency grinding head with 60,000 revolutions per minute in 1958, and an air-bearing grinding head with 100,000 revolutions per minute in 1959. This year, they are determined to manufacture a grinding head with 150,000 revolutions per minute. At present, a "three-way combination" team of cadres, technicians, and workers has been established to actively research and trial-produce. In addition to this grinding head, they have also recently manufactured the first double-spindle vertical planetary internal grinder in China for processing locomotive connecting rods.

The workers of small and medium-sized factories with poor production technology conditions put forward the slogan "Small factory with great ambition, not afraid of poor conditions," and while improving the quality and output of existing products, they also diligently study and work hard to advance towards new technologies. The Chong'an District Safety Switch Factory, which started with a few files and pliers, only repaired electrical switches in the past. In the second half of last year, it began to manufacture some simple electrical equipment. In the first quarter of this year, it began to manufacture 17 new products, such as explosion-proof switches for coal mines and remote electrical control switches. In the process of trial-producing new products, they made their own equipment in the absence of equipment and sought advice when they did not understand the technology. The recently trial-produced automatic electrical switch has more than 100 parts, most of which are manufactured by hand. Now they are vigorously developing modularization to prepare for mass production. The Baisui Chemical Factory, run by six housewives in Baisui Lane, made a kind of agricultural acid-base detector after repeated experiments based on the information in books. The quality of the inspection results was qualified. This product is of great significance for supporting agriculture in improving soil and raising fish. Many other small factories have also made a big step forward on the existing basis.

In order to meet the needs of various industries in the development towards "high, precision, and cutting-edge" for instruments, under the unified leadership and planning of the Wuxi Municipal Party Committee, telecommunications instrument factories are being established in a big way by means of a parent factory running subsidiary factories. In the past 20 days, the number of telecommunications instrument factories in the city has increased from 12 to more than 100, the number of workers has increased from more than 1,000 to more than 6,000, and a number of new products such as electronic automatic control instruments, automatic regulating valves, and gas flow meters have been trial-produced.

At present, this mass movement towards new technologies has begun to spread from the industrial front to the commercial, cultural, and educational systems.

    无锡市委提出新的技术革新努力目标
    造新产品　赶名牌货
    全市一个多月出现三百多种新产品
    本报南京1日电　江苏省无锡市工业战线最近开展了一个向“高、精、尖”方向进军的群众运动。各行各业都按照不同的生产特点和技术基础，大闹技术革命，造新产品、赶名牌货、攻尖端、攀高峰。在短短一个多月中，全市就出现了三百多种新产品，其中比较精密的产品有十多种。
    这一群众性运动，是这个市目前技术革命运动的新发展，各行各业都根据本身生产的特点和生产技术条件，明确自己的奋斗目标。无锡市的冶金工业是在“小土群”的基础上发展起来的。这次，他们的努力目标是在高产优质的基础上，向生产多种合金钢和有色金属方向发展。最近已试炼成矽钢和几种有色金属。机电工业系统将制造和试制各种精密机床、大马力柴油机、大口径水泵和高级电讯器材、精密仪表等。纺织工业系统将制造高级的棉毛纺织品和丝绸织物，并且在生产中试验和运用静电纺纱、高速织布、自动缫丝、真空煮茧等新技术。轻化工系统将造出大批赶上名牌货的日用工业品和重要化工原料。他们一边规划，一边积极和科学研究部门、学校密切配合，开展研究试制工作。不少新产品一经试制成功，就立即投入生产。
    在向新技术进军中，生产技术条件较好的大工厂，职工们雄心勃勃地提出了“好上再好，更上一层楼”的口号。无锡机床厂1958年制成了每分钟六万转的高频率磨头，1959年又制出了每分钟十万转的空气轴承磨头，今年他们决心要把每分钟十五万转的磨头制造出来。目前已成立了干部、技术人员、工人“三结合”小组积极研究试制。除这种磨头外，最近他们还制成了国内第一台加工机车连杆的双轴立式行星内圆磨床。
    生产技术条件较差的中小型工厂职工，提出“厂小志气大，不怕条件差”的口号，在提高现有产品质量、产量的同时，也穷钻苦干，向新技术进军。靠几把锉刀钳子起家的崇安区安全开关厂，过去只是修理电气开关，去年下半年开始制造一些简单的电气设备，今年第一季度开始制造煤矿用的防爆开关、远距离电气控制开关等十七种新产品。他们在试制新产品过程中，没有设备，自己造土的，不懂技术，就出门取经求教。最近试制成功的自动电气开关，有一百多种零件，大部分是用手工制造出来的，现在正在大搞模具化，准备成批生产。百岁坊六个家庭妇女办起来的百岁化工厂，根据书本上的资料，经过反复试验，制成一种农用酸碱测定器，检定结果，质量合格；这种产品对支援农业改良土壤及养鱼等有很大作用。其他许多小型工厂也都在现有基础上向前跃进了一大步。
    为了适应各行各业向“高、精、尖”方向发展中对仪表的需要，在中共无锡市委统一领导和规划下，以母厂办子厂的办法，大办电讯仪表工厂。近二十天来，全市电讯仪表工厂从十二家发展到一百多家，工人由一千多人增加到六千多人，并试制出电子自动控制仪、自动调节阀、煤气流量计等一批新产品。
    目前，这一向新技术进军的群众性运动，已开始从工业战线推向商业、文教等系统。
