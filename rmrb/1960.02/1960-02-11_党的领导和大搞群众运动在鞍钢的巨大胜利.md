The production and construction of Anshan Iron and Steel Works (hereinafter referred to as Ansteel) achieved a great leap forward in 1958 and 1959. In 1958, many engineering projects were completed ahead of schedule while ensuring quality, basically completing the overall technical transformation of Ansteel; and in just two months, a number of small-scale steelmaking furnaces were built; compared with 1957, the output of major products increased by 35.45% for steel, 22.73% for pig iron, and 29.15% for steel products. In 1959, with no increase in the main production equipment of blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces, the growth rate of many products exceeded the growth rate of previous years, and the quality and specifications of major products were continuously improved and increased. With the development of production and construction, a technical team with a certain technical level has also been trained and cultivated. At the same time, people's mental outlook has also undergone tremendous changes. As the country's first iron and steel base, Ansteel is playing an increasingly important role, powerfully supporting the country's socialist construction.

The Victory of the Struggle Between Two Ideologies and Two Lines

The most fundamental reason why Ansteel has been able to achieve the above achievements is the firm implementation of the ideas and lines of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, the adherence to the Party's absolute leadership over enterprises, the vigorous development of mass movements, and the thorough carrying out of political and ideological revolution. In the past few years, there have always been two ideologies and two lines in the development of Ansteel. One is to adhere to putting politics in command, adhere to the Party's absolute leadership over enterprises, adhere to the working method of the mass line, combine the Party's centralized leadership with the vigorous development of mass movements, and conscientiously implement the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee. This is a correct line for running enterprises by the proletariat; the other is to adhere to "technology in command," adhere to "economy in command," and adhere to the "technical expert" line. This is a wrong line for running enterprises by the bourgeoisie. In the process of the struggle between these two lines, under the leadership of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, we have unswervingly adhered to the former correct line and continuously opposed and criticized the latter wrong line. After a long, sharp, and tortuous struggle, the Party's correct line has won a complete victory.

In the struggle between two ideologies and two lines, we have focused on criticizing the following erroneous views:

One view is that modern large enterprises have advanced equipment and complex technology, and to do a good job in production, technology is the first priority. "With technology, you have everything." They do not rely on the Party and the masses to run enterprises, but only rely on a few experts and engineering technicians. In the past few years, especially the facts of the great leap forward in 1958 and the continued great leap forward in 1959, it has been proved that only when politics leads technology and technology serves politics can we produce more steel and more ore; and can we unite the broad masses of workers and improve their political and ideological awareness. The "theory of technology first" is completely wrong. Of course, it is necessary for Party cadres to understand the necessary production and construction business and scientific and technological knowledge in order to do a good job in leadership. However, when studying business and technology, we must never ignore politics. Ansteel realized more than 76,500 technical innovations and popularized more than 27,800 advanced experiences in the three months from September to November 1959. This is precisely the result of implementing putting politics in command, fully mobilizing the broad masses of workers, and implementing the "three-in-one combination". If we only rely on a few experts and technicians, it is simply impossible to achieve.

One view is that the main method to improve the enthusiasm of workers is material incentives, and political and ideological education is placed in second place. In the past few years, especially the facts of the great leap forward in the past two years, it has been proved that strengthening political and ideological education is the main method to continuously improve the sense of responsibility and enthusiasm of the working class. In the great leap forward, many workers fought day and night to complete their tasks, regardless of conditions and remuneration; many factories and mines took the initiative to cooperate and sacrificed themselves for others in order to support fraternal units. This high socialist labor enthusiasm and communist style can never be achieved by simply using material incentives. Of course, we do not deny the role of material encouragement, but we must correctly combine political education and material encouragement, and take politics as the soul and commander. On the basis of strengthening political education and raising awareness, we must carry out necessary material encouragement. In this way, we can maximize the enthusiasm of the workers, always strive for progress and strive for the top, and ensure the continuous development of production.

One view is that in modern large enterprises, production is mechanized and automated, and mechanical equipment is the main thing, and that giving full play to people's subjective initiative is said to be "violating objective laws." In old factories, they emphasize that the equipment is old and the potential has been exhausted; in new factories, they emphasize that the equipment is advanced and difficult to master; in the smelting system, they emphasize that the furnace has a cycle and production fluctuations are inevitable; in the rolling system, they emphasize that the equipment capacity has a design standard and is sacred and inviolable, and so on. Whenever an increase in production is proposed, they ask for conditions. Things that can be done are not done, and tasks that can be strived for are not worked hard to complete. Facts have proved that machinery and equipment are important, but human factors are more important. Machinery and equipment must be mastered by people, and objective laws can be understood; only by fully mobilizing people's subjective initiative can machinery and equipment play a greater role. For example, the seamless steel pipe plant and the rolling plate plant are highly automated new plants, and the first primary rolling plant and the first medium plate plant are old plants with outdated equipment. Since the great leap forward, none of the above-mentioned plants have added new main equipment, but after people's enthusiasm has been fully mobilized, the production of the seamless steel pipe plant and the first primary rolling plant has doubled and a half, the first medium plate plant has realized one plant becoming three plants, and the rolling plate plant has only been in operation for half a year, and the actual production level has exceeded the design capacity by 15.1%. These are all great victories of attaching great importance to the role of people.

One view is that to manage modern large enterprises, one can only "operate regularly," only act according to "routine," and cannot engage in large-scale mass movements, otherwise, it will "disrupt production order," "destroy production balance," and "hinder normal production." They said that engaging in large-scale mass movements is a "rural style" and "formalism," advocating "stability" and working according to plans and charts, fearing that the masses would rise up and break through the so-called production "balance." They only pay attention to ready-made conclusions in books and do not pay attention to the inventions and creations of the masses. They regard rules and regulations as immutable things, and regard people as slaves of rules and regulations, in order to issue orders and use the system to manage people. This is actually treating the mass movement with a bourgeois master-like attitude. The facts since the great leap forward have proved that when the mass movement rises up, it will inevitably break through all the traditional habitual forces that bind the development of productive forces. Ansteel established and revised more than 6,700 various rules and regulations from September to November 1959, which not only did not "hinder normal production," but greatly increased the growth rate of major products, not by a few percent or a dozen percent, but by more than 20 or 30 percent. Therefore, all kinds of excuses made to oppose the vigorous development of mass movements are untenable.

In short, Ansteel's production and construction work has been carried out on the basis of constantly carrying out the struggle between two ideologies and two lines. Every step deeper in the struggle is accompanied by a step forward in production. The nature of this struggle is generally a contradiction within the people, so we have adhered to the working method of the mass line and the method of presenting facts and reasoning in the process of the struggle, relying on the majority of the masses, and thoroughly refuted the above-mentioned various erroneous views ideologically and theoretically. It is precisely because of this that we have better united and educated all Party members and all workers and masses, and constantly achieved new victories in the socialist cause.

Adhering to Party Leadership and the Mass Line is Our Fundamental Line for Running Enterprises

Through several years of mass political and production movements, we have further realized that adhering to putting politics in command, adhering to Party leadership, and adhering to the mass line is the fundamental line for the proletariat to run enterprises, is the only way to develop production at a high speed, and has already explored and accumulated some experience in this regard.

The great socialist construction cause first requires people to have a spirit of hard work, a great ambition, and a spirit of riding the wind and waves and not fearing difficulties. With hard work, we can strive for the top; with hard work, we can achieve more, faster, better, and more economically; with hard work, we can be invincible. In any factory, mine, workshop, or department, wherever the cadres and masses have more enthusiasm, the production there will be booming; otherwise, production will stagnate or decline. Therefore, in order to build socialism more, faster, better, and more economically and realize a greater leap forward in production, we must greatly encourage hard work, and we must constantly encourage it. Only when hard work is encouraged again and again and striving for the top is done again and again can production leap again and again. According to the spirit of continuous revolution, when a task is about to be completed, with the changes in the production situation, new struggle goals and new battle slogans should be put forward in a timely manner, and we must always be like the waves of the river and sea, "one wave has not subsided, another wave rises again." In this way, we can prevent the masses from becoming slack and complacent, constantly encourage greater enthusiasm, and keep the broad masses in a state of vigorous fighting spirit and full of revolutionary enthusiasm, so that the production movement can move forward wave after wave. Of course, in the mass movement, we should pay attention to combining hard work with scientific analysis. The so-called scientific analysis is to analyze both the material conditions and the human conditions; to consider both unfavorable conditions and favorable conditions; to see both the existing conditions and the new conditions that will appear after people's subjective efforts. Our scientific analysis is not to discourage people, but to strengthen our confidence, make us more enthusiastic, and have greater certainty after analysis. We should also pay attention to formulating plans that are both advanced and reliable. Plans that are too high or too low are not conducive to boosting the enthusiasm of the masses and will affect their enthusiasm. We should also pay attention to combining combat with rest. When the movement reaches a certain climax and completes the predetermined task, we must take a rest in a timely manner to achieve a combination of work and rest.

We must vigorously carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and constantly push this movement to new climaxes. Technical innovation and technical revolution are the infinite source of improving labor productivity. Technical innovation and technical revolution are of particularly important significance to large foreign enterprises. An iron and steel joint enterprise like Ansteel, after ten years of restoration and construction, it should be said today that the main body has been basically completed. In the future, expanding and improving production capacity cannot rely on building or expanding factories and adding new equipment, but mainly on the broad masses of workers and staff, strengthening weak links in various factories, mines, workshops, and processes, improving equipment, improving tools, and improving production methods, and tapping the potential of existing equipment. This requires further extensive and in-depth development of technical innovation and technical revolution. To carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, we must both let go of mobilizing the masses and make overall plans, so that the planning of the leadership is combined with the mass movement. To carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, on the one hand, we must seize the key, guide and organize the masses to besiege the key, so as to promote the overall leap forward in the entire production; at the same time, we must not relax the solution of thousands of large and small topics. Both grab watermelons and pick sesame seeds. To carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, on the one hand, we must give full play to the enthusiasm and creative talents of the broad masses of workers and staff, and at the same time strengthen scientific research work, give play to the role of technical personnel, and better implement the "three-in-one combination." In technical innovation and technical revolution, we should adopt foreign methods if possible, and adopt indigenous methods if foreign methods cannot be adopted, or adopt semi-indigenous and semi-foreign methods to combine foreign and indigenous methods. To carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, it is necessary to add some new equipment and increase certain investment, but the more important method should be to mobilize the masses, look inward, and tap potential. To carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, it is more important to emancipate the mind, break superstitions, and promote the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do. Without ideological emancipation and ideological revolution, there will be no technological revolution. Experience has proved that the technical performance competitions currently being carried out, especially the joint technical performance competitions, are a new initiative for carrying out mass movements in modern industrial enterprises, and are the most extensive and effective form of mobilizing and organizing the masses to participate in technical innovation and technical revolution movements.

We must strengthen collaboration and mutual assistance and promote the communist style. A modern industrial enterprise is a closely linked whole. The upper and lower processes, the three shifts day and night, the departments, and the various links are interrelated and mutually influential. If one department or one link cannot keep up, it will affect the overall leap forward in the entire enterprise production. Especially for a large joint enterprise like Ansteel, it requires better and closer collaboration and cooperation. Therefore, first of all, we must often conduct education on the overall concept of "one game of chess" to the broad masses of workers and staff, establish the idea of communist large-scale collaboration, and always put taking care of the overall situation, supporting the main body, and supporting others in the first place. Secondly, we must organize mass collaboration. Since 1959, Ansteel has organized "one-dragon" large-scale collaboration centering on iron smelting, including mines, coking, sintering, and transportation; centering on steel smelting, including iron smelting, crushed iron, refractory materials, and transportation; and centering on the primary rolling plant, including rolling and other related units. This experience was successful. Later, on the basis of the universal promotion of technical performance competitions, a joint technical performance competition was carried out within the entire company, with unified leadership, unified planning, and unified action, which not only made the workshops within the factories and mines, and the upper and lower processes act in coordination, but also made the relevant factories and mines associated with it act in coordination, so as to ensure that key units and general units, production departments and auxiliary departments leap forward together, and promote the overall improvement of enterprise production. According to past experience, while organizing large-scale internal collaboration in enterprises, we must also pay close attention to collaboration with fraternal enterprises throughout the country and the province, which is of great importance to Ansteel. Because Ansteel is currently the largest iron and steel enterprise in our country, the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the people of the whole country are all very concerned about us and earnestly expect us to do our work better, and we must use larger quantities, better quality, and more varieties of steel and cultivate more and better talents to support the whole country.

We must care about the lives of the workers and mobilize both inside and outside the factory. Caring about the lives of the workers is a political issue and an important aspect of our Party's work in enterprises. We must implement the policy of "grasping production with one hand and grasping life with the other" and grasp the three aspects of production, ideology, and life at the same time. The greater the enthusiasm of the workers, the more attention should be paid to the lives of the workers; the more attention is paid to improving the lives of the masses, the higher the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers. We must care about the lives of the workers in an all-round way, both political life and material and cultural life. On the one hand, we must often understand the political and ideological situation of the workers, solve ideological problems, and conduct communist education, so that they can realize the consistency of personal and immediate interests with collective and long-term interests, and understand that the rapid construction of socialism and further transition to communism is the highest interest of the working class. At the same time, we must do our best to do a good job in welfare and cultural activities, so that workers can eat well, rest well, and have fun, so that the broad masses of workers can always maintain vigorous revolutionary energy and full energy to carry out production better. At the same time, to improve the lives of workers, we must also rely on the masses, follow the mass line, and combine factory management and mass management. To care about the lives of the workers, we must pay attention to not unilaterally emphasizing life without leaving the basis of developing production. We must uphold the spirit of diligence and thrift, learn to live rich days as poor days, and make it clear that the purpose of improving life is to promote a greater leap forward in production.

The vigorous development of mass movements must be closely combined with strengthening enterprise management. With the continuous and in-depth development of mass movements, it will inevitably break through the old production balance, break through all the old rules and regulations that bind the development of productive forces, and disrupt the old production order; at the same time, it requires the timely establishment of a new production balance, new rules and regulations, and a new production order to continuously improve the management level of the enterprise. Otherwise, it will affect the enthusiasm of the masses and hinder the in-depth and sustained development of the mass movement. Improving the enterprise management level, in turn, promotes the development of the mass production movement. With the unprecedented improvement of the class consciousness of the workers, the large number of innovations, and the change of style of management cadres, it has created extremely favorable conditions for improving the enterprise management level and establishing a new production order. To strengthen enterprise management and improve enterprise management level, we must also mobilize the masses, vigorously carry out mass movements, so that the masses and leaders are integrated, and the top-down professional management and the bottom-up mass management are closely combined. We must educate administrative management personnel at all levels to establish the view of serving production, the view of believing in and relying on the masses, rely on the broad masses to establish and improve various rules and regulations, enrich and improve the new technological regulations, so that the enterprise rules and regulations and production technological regulations truly become the crystallization of the wisdom of the broad masses and are more in line with the needs of production reality; guide them to jump out of the circle of the office, go deep into the site, go deep into the reality of production, conduct investigations and research, summarize the experience of the masses, and solve practical problems in production together with the masses. We must also fully mobilize the broad masses of workers, attract them to participate in management work, and establish a system to make workers participate in management regularly. Only when the leaders are closely combined with the masses, and the Party's mass line is implemented in enterprise management work, can the enterprise management work give full play to the role of promoting production. Strengthening enterprise management is a regular matter, and we must have the idea of continuous revolution; without this idea, it is impossible to realize the continuous revolution of enterprise management work. Facts have proved that whenever the idea of continuous revolution is adhered to in enterprise management work, and the old is constantly broken and the new is established in the various stages of mass movement development, the mass movement will develop healthily, and the production enthusiasm of the workers will always be full; otherwise, the mass movement will stagnate after developing to a certain extent, and the production enthusiasm of the workers will be greatly affected. In strengthening enterprise management work, Ansteel has combined leadership with the masses, combined breaking with establishing, and adopted the method of continuous revolution, so that the mass movement has exerted great power and promoted the vigorous development of production. Of course, there are still many shortcomings in the enterprise management level that are not adapted to the needs of production development, and we must continue to improve and strengthen them in the future, and we must never have the idea of "once and for all."

Strengthening Party leadership is the fundamental guarantee for doing all work well. Countless facts in the past few years have proved that in a modern enterprise like Ansteel, Party work must be strengthened, the Party must lead everything, and it can also lead everything. Implementing the unified leadership of the Party committee will not only not hinder the work of various departments, but under the unified leadership of the Party committee, it will make the work of various departments more coordinated, the top and bottom more coordinated, the thinking unified, the pace unified, and the unity united, and work together to realize the unified goals proposed by the Party. The Party organization in the enterprise should implement the principle of centralized power and decentralized power, give play to the organizational role of various departments, implement the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee, and give play to the role of the trade union and the Communist Youth League. The most important task of the Party organization in the enterprise is to constantly propose new tasks, constantly mobilize the masses, and lead the masses to successfully complete the national plan according to the requirements of the higher authorities and the specific conditions of the enterprise. This requires us to be good at seizing the center in every period, proposing clear struggle goals, and mobilizing the broad masses to struggle towards this goal. When the center is seized and the goal is clear, it will drive the overall situation and promote the overall leap forward in production. We must be good at grasping ideas, we must conduct in-depth research on economic work, but we must see ideological problems through economic work, especially to grasp the common ideological problems that hinder the progress of the movement. When ideological problems are grasped and ideological problems are solved, work is promoted. Of course, while solving ideological problems, we must also solve practical problems, so that the work becomes more and more meticulous and as close as possible to reality or in line with reality. We must be good at grasping organization, grasping the Party organization, the administrative organization, the trade union organization, and the Communist Youth League organization. First of all, these organizations must serve the central work, and at the same time, they strengthen the work of these departments. We must pay attention to examining Party members, examining cadres, developing Party members, and training cadres in the movement. We must be good at grasping both ends, leading the middle, paying attention to discovering new things, paying attention to summarizing advanced experiences; at the same time, we must pay attention to strengthening weak links and paying attention to helping the backward. Ansteel's experience proves that the Party organization grasps the mass movement and completes the task of economic construction through vigorously carrying out the mass movement. The result is not only economic, but also a comprehensive harvest in ideology, organization, and economy. The enterprise Party organization should organize cadres to seriously study Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's line, principles, and policies, pay attention to carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and struggle against bad tendencies. In particular, it is necessary to constantly oppose right-leaning and oppose bourgeois individualism, and achieve unity on the basis of ideological unity.

In the past few years, Ansteel has achieved great achievements and accumulated some experience in strengthening Party leadership, vigorously carrying out mass movements, and organizing production leap forward; however, there are still many shortcomings and problems. With the high-speed development of national economic construction and scientific research, Ansteel must and should better play the role of iron and steel base. 1960 is a year of better and more comprehensive leap forward, and Ansteel is shouldering a heavier and more glorious task than in the past. Without adding new equipment, we must produce more, better, and newer steel products; we must march towards the direction of high (grade), large (scale), precision (precision), and cutting-edge (edge); we must support the whole country with more manpower and material resources. Therefore, we must continue to adhere to the Party's general line, adhere to putting politics in command, greatly encourage hard work, prevent and overcome complacency and slack emotions, work conscientiously, strive to do our work well, push the mass movement to a new climax, and on the basis of realizing a good start in 1960, advance victoriously, earnestly achieve red every month, red every quarter, and red to the end, and vigorously support the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and construction in the country.

    党的领导和大搞群众运动在鞍钢的巨大胜利
    中共鞍山市委第一书记　杨士杰
    1958年和1959年，鞍钢的生产和建设都获得了大跃进。1958年，许多工程项目在保证质量的前提下，竣工时间一再提前，基本上完成了鞍钢总体技术改造的任务；而且在短短的两个月里，还建成了一批钢铁小洋群；主要产品的产量，与1957年比较，钢提高35．45％，生铁提高22．73％，钢材提高29．15％。1959年，在高炉和平炉主体生产设备没有增加的情况下，很多产品增长的速度，都超过历年增长的速度，主要产品质量和规格也有不断的提高和增加。随着生产建设事业的发展，还锻炼和培养出一支具有一定技术水平的技术队伍。与此同时，人们的精神面貌也发生了巨大的变化。鞍钢作为国家第一个钢铁基地，正在愈来愈大地发挥它的作用，有力地支援了全国的社会主义建设事业。
    两种思想两条路线斗争的胜利
    鞍钢之所以能够取得上述成就，最根本的原因是坚决贯彻执行了党中央和毛泽东同志的思想和路线，坚持了党对企业的绝对领导和大搞群众运动以及深入地进行政治思想革命的结果。几年来，在鞍钢的发展过程中始终存在着两种思想、两条路线的斗争。一条是坚持政治挂帅，坚持党对企业的绝对领导，坚持群众路线的工作方法，使党的集中领导与大搞群众运动相结合，认真地贯彻执行党委领导下的厂长负责制，这是一条无产阶级办企业的正确路线；一条是坚持“技术挂帅”，坚持“经济挂帅”，坚持“技术专家”路线，这是一条资产阶级办企业的错误路线。在这两条路线的斗争过程中，我们在中央和省委领导下，始终不渝地坚持了前一条正确的路线，不断地反对、批判了后一条错误的路线。经过长期的尖锐的和曲折的斗争以后，党的正确路线取得了彻底的胜利。
    在两种思想、两条路线的斗争中，我们集中的批判了下列错误观点：
    有一种观点，认为现代化大企业设备先进，技术复杂，要搞好生产，技术是第一位的，“有了技术就有了一切”。他们不依靠党和群众办企业，而只依靠少数专家和工程技术人员办企业。几年来，特别是1958年大跃进和1959年继续大跃进的事实证明，只有政治领导技术，技术为政治服务，才能多产钢、多出矿石；也才能团结广大职工群众，提高他们的政治思想觉悟。“技术第一论”是完全错误的。当然，党的干部为了作好领导工作，懂得必要的生产建设业务和科学技术知识是需要的。但是，在钻研业务和技术的时候，绝不能忽视政治。鞍钢1959年从9月到11月的三个月中，即实现了技术革新七万六千五百多件，推广先进经验二万七千八百多项，正是由于实行政治挂帅，充分发动广大工人群众和实行三结合的结果。如果只依靠少数专家和技术人员，是根本不可能做到的。
    有一种观点，认为提高职工群众劳动积极性的主要方法是物质刺激，而把政治思想教育放在第二位。几年来，特别是近两年来大跃进的事实证明，加强政治思想教育，是不断提高工人阶级主人翁责任感和劳动积极性的主要方法。许多工人在大跃进中，为了完成任务，不讲条件，不计报酬，日夜奋战；许多厂矿，为了支援兄弟单位，主动配合，舍己为人。这种高涨的社会主义劳动热情和共产主义风格，绝不是单纯用物质刺激的方法所能达到的。当然，我们也不否定物质鼓励的作用，但是必须把政治教育与物质鼓励正确地结合起来，并以政治为灵魂、为统帅，在加强政治教育、提高觉悟的基础上，进行必要的物质鼓励。这样，才能最大限度地发挥职工群众的生产积极性，经常鼓足干劲、力争上游，保证生产持续不断地向前发展。
    有一种观点，认为现代化大企业生产机械化、自动化，机械设备是主要的，把充分发挥人的主观能动性，说成是“违反客观规律”。在老厂子，则强调设备陈旧，潜力挖光；在新厂子，则强调设备先进，难以掌握；在冶炼系统，则强调炉子有周期性，生产波动不可避免；在轧钢系统，则强调设备能力有设计标准，神圣不可侵犯，等等。一提出增产，他们就要条件，本来可以办到的事情不去办，可以争取完成的任务不去努力完成。事实证明，机械、设备固然重要，但人的因素更为重要。机械、设备是要人去掌握的，客观规律是可以被认识的；只有把人的主观能动性充分调动起来，机械、设备才能发挥出更大的作用。例如，无缝钢管厂和轧板厂，都是高度自动化的新厂，第一初轧厂和第一中板厂都是设备陈旧的老厂。大跃进以来，上述各厂都没有增加新的主体设备，但是，人的积极性被充分调动起来之后，无缝钢管厂、第一初轧厂的生产都翻了一番半，第一中板厂实现了一厂变三厂，轧板厂开工仅有半年时间，实际生产水平即超过了设计能力15．1％。这都是高度重视人的作用的巨大胜利。
    有一种观点，认为管理现代化大企业，只能“正规作业”，只能按“常规”办事，不能大搞群众运动，否则，便会“打乱生产秩序”，“破坏生产均衡”，“妨碍正常生产”。他们说大搞群众运动，是“农村作风”，是“形式主义”，主张“四平八稳”，按计划图表工作，生怕群众起来，冲破所谓的生产“均衡”。他们只重视书本上的现成结论而不重视群众的创造发明。他们把规章制度看成是一成不变的东西，把人看成是规章制度的奴隶，以利于发号施令，用制度管人。这实际上是用资产阶级老爷式的态度对待群众运动。大跃进以来的事实证明，当群众运动起来之后，必然要冲破一切束缚生产力发展的传统的习惯势力。鞍钢在1959年9至11月间，建立和修订了各种规章制度六千七百多项，不但没有“妨碍正常生产”，反而使主要产品增长的幅度大大提高，不是百分之几、百分之十几，而是百分之二十、三十以上。因而，那种为反对大搞群众运动而制造出来的种种借口，都是站不住脚的。
    总之，鞍钢的生产建设工作，就是在不断地开展两种思想、两条路线斗争的基础上进行的。斗争每深入一步，生产也随之提高一步。这种斗争的性质，一般的说是属于人民内部的矛盾，因此我们根据中央和省委指示，在斗争过程中，坚持群众路线的工作方法，坚持摆事实、讲道理的方法，依靠群众大多数，从思想上、理论上彻底地驳倒了上述各种错误观点。正因为这样，才更好地团结和教育了全体党员和全体职工群众，在社会主义事业中不断地取得新的胜利。
    坚持党的领导和群众路线是我们办企业的根本路线
    经过几年来群众性的政治运动和生产运动，使我们进一步地认识到坚持政治挂帅、坚持党的领导和群众路线是无产阶级办企业的根本路线，是高速度地发展生产的必由之路，并且已经摸索和积累了一些这方面的经验。
    伟大的社会主义建设事业，首先要求人们有一股干劲，有一个雄心大志，有一种乘风破浪、不怕困难的精神。有了干劲，才能争得上游；有了干劲，才能多快好省；有了干劲，才能战无不胜。无论哪一个厂矿、哪一个车间、哪一个部门，哪里干部和群众的干劲愈大，哪里的生产就蒸蒸日上；反之生产就会停滞或者下降。因此，为了多快好省地建设社会主义，实现生产的更大跃进，必须大鼓干劲，要不断地鼓、经常地鼓。只有干劲一鼓再鼓，上游一争再争，生产才能一跃再跃。要根据不断革命的精神，当着一个任务将要完成的时候，随着生产形势的变化，不断地适时地提出新的奋斗目标，提出新的战斗口号，要永远像江海的波涛一样，“一波未平，一波又起”。这样才能防止群众的松劲自满情绪，不断鼓足更大的干劲，使广大群众经常保持旺盛的斗志和充沛的革命热情，使生产运动一浪高一浪地前进。当然，在群众运动中，我们应当注意干劲必须与科学分析相结合。所谓科学分析，就是既要分析物的条件，又要分析人的条件；既考虑到不利条件，又考虑到有利条件；既看到现有条件，还要看到经过人的主观努力将要出现的新的条件。我们进行科学分析不是泄劲，而是使我们经过分析信心更强，干劲更足，把握更大。我们还应注意制订计划既要先进，又要可靠。计划订的过高或过低都不利于鼓足群众的干劲，都会影响群众的积极性。我们还要注意战斗与休整相结合，当运动达到一定高潮，完成了预定任务之后，必须适时地进行休整，做到有张有弛，劳逸结合。
    必须大搞技术革新和技术革命运动，并把这个运动不断地推向新的高潮。技术革新和技术革命是提高劳动生产率的无穷无尽的源泉。技术革新和技术革命对大的洋的企业来说更有特别重要的意义。像鞍钢这样一个钢铁联合企业，经过十年的恢复和建设，今天应该说，主体已经基本建成了，今后扩大和提高生产能力，不能再是依靠新建或扩建工厂和增添新设备，而主要是依靠广大职工群众，在各个厂矿、各个车间、各个工序上，加强薄弱环节，改进设备、改进工具、改进生产方法，挖掘现有设备潜力。这就需要进一步广泛深入地开展技术革新和技术革命。开展技术革新和技术革命，既要放手发动群众，又要通盘规划，使领导上的规划与群众运动相结合。开展技术革新和技术革命，一方面必须抓住关键，引导和组织群众围攻关键，以促使整个生产的全面跃进；同时，又不放松千千万万大大小小的课题的解决。既抱西瓜，又拣芝麻。开展技术革新和技术革命，一方面要充分发挥广大职工群众的积极性和创造才能，同时又要加强科学研究工作，发挥技术人员的作用，更好地实行三结合。在技术革新和技术革命中，能采用洋办法的就采用洋办法，不能采用洋办法的就采用土办法，或者采用半土半洋的办法，把洋和土结合起来。开展技术革新和技术革命，增添一些新设备，增加一定的投资是必要的，但更主要的办法应当是发动群众，眼睛向内，挖掘潜力。开展技术革新和技术革命，更重要的是要解放思想，破除迷信，发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格。没有思想上的解放和思想的革命，也就不会有技术上的革命。经验证明，目前正在开展的技术表演赛、特别是联合技术大表演竞赛，是现代化工业企业中大搞群众运动的一项新的创举，是发动和组织群众参加技术革新和技术革命运动的一个最广泛最有效的形式。
    必须加强协作互助，发扬共产主义风格。现代化工业企业是一个紧密联系的整体，上下工序之间，日夜三班之间，部门之间，各个环节之间是互相关联、互相影响的。如果一个部门、一个环节跟不上，就影响整个企业生产的全面跃进。尤其像鞍钢这样大型的联合企业，要求更好地更密切地进行协作和配合。因此，首先要经常向广大职工群众进行“一盘棋”的整体观念教育，树立共产主义大协作思想，时刻把照顾全局、支援主体、支援别人放在第一位。其次，必须组织群众性的大协作。1959年以来，鞍钢曾以炼铁为中心，包括矿山、炼焦、烧结、运输；以炼钢为中心，包括炼铁、碎铁、耐火、运输；以初轧厂为中心，包括轧钢等有关单位；分别组织“一条龙”大协作。这个经验是成功的。以后又在普遍推行技术表演赛的基础上，在全公司范围内，实行统一领导、统一计划、统一行动，开展了联合技术大表演竞赛，不仅使厂矿内部车间之间、上下工序之间协同动作，并且使与它相联系的有关厂矿协同动作，从而保证了重点单位和一般单位、生产部门和辅助部门一齐跃进，推动了企业生产的全面提高。根据过去的经验，在组织企业内部大协作的同时，还要十分注意与全国全省的各兄弟企业之间的协作，这对于鞍钢有着非常重要的意义。因为鞍钢目前是我国最大的钢铁企业，党中央、毛主席和全国人民都在万分地关怀着我们，殷切地期望我们，我们必须把工作做得更好，必须把生产数量更大、质量更好、品种更多的钢材和培养又多又好的人材来支援全国。
    必须关心职工群众生活，厂内外一齐发动。关心职工生活，这是一个政治问题，是我们党在企业工作中的一个重要方面。我们必须贯彻执行“一手抓生产，一手抓生活”的方针，把生产、思想和生活三个方面同时抓起来。职工群众的生产劲头越大，越要注意职工群众的生活；越注意改善群众的生活，广大职工群众的劳动热情就越高涨。对于职工群众的生活，必须全面地关心，既要关心政治生活，又要关心物质生活和文化生活。一方面要经常地了解职工政治思想情况，解决思想问题，进行共产主义教育，使他们认识到个人的、眼前的利益和集体的、长远的利益的一致性，使他们懂得迅速地建成社会主义、并进一步过渡到共产主义，才是工人阶级的最高利益。同时，又要尽可能的搞好生活福利和文化活动，让职工吃好、休息好、娱乐好，使广大职工得以经常保持旺盛的革命干劲和充沛的精力，更好地进行生产。同时，搞好职工生活，也要依靠群众，走群众路线，把工厂管理和群众管理结合起来。关心职工群众生活，必须注意不能离开发展生产的基础去片面地强调生活，要本着勤俭的精神，学会将富日子当穷日子过，明确改善生活的目的是为了促进生产更大的跃进。
    大搞群众运动必须与加强企业管理紧密结合。随着群众运动的不断深入发展，必然要冲破旧的生产平衡，冲破一切束缚生产力的陈规旧律，打乱旧的生产秩序；同时要求及时地建立新的生产平衡、新的规章制度和新的生产秩序，不断提高企业的管理水平。否则，就会影响群众的积极性，阻碍群众运动深入和持久的开展。企业管理水平提高了，反过来又促进群众生产运动的开展。随着职工群众阶级觉悟的空前提高，各种革新的大量涌现，管理干部作风的转变，又为提高企业管理水平，建立新的生产秩序，创造极为有利的条件。加强企业管理工作，提高企业管理水平，也必须发动群众，大搞群众运动，使群众和领导结成一体，使自上而下的专业管理和自下而上的群众管理密切结合。要教育各级行政管理人员，树立为生产服务的观点、相信和依靠群众的观点，依靠广大群众建立和健全各种规章制度，充实和健全新的工艺规程，使企业规章制度和生产上的工艺规程，真正成为广大群众智慧的结晶，更加切合生产实际的需要；引导他们跳出办公室的圈子，深入现场，深入生产实际，进行调查研究，总结群众的经验，同群众一道解决生产中的实际问题。更要充分地发动广大工人群众，吸引他们参加管理工作，并建立一套制度，使工人参加管理经常化。只有领导与群众密切结合，在企业管理工作上实行党的群众路线，才能使企业管理工作充分发挥促进生产的作用。加强企业管理是一项经常的事情，必须具有不断革命的思想；如果没有这种思想，就不可能实现企业管理工作的不断革命。事实证明，凡是在企业管理工作上坚持了不断革命的思想，在群众运动发展的各个阶段，经常不断地破旧立新的厂矿，群众运动就发展得健康，职工群众的生产热情就始终饱满；反之，群众运动发展到一定程度则停滞不前，职工群众的生产热情就大受影响。鞍钢在加强企业管理工作中，由于领导与群众相结合，破和立相结合，同时采取了不断革命的方法，因而使群众运动发挥了巨大的威力，促进了生产的蓬勃发展。当然，企业管理水平还有不少与生产的发展需要不相适应的地方，今后仍须不断改进和加强，绝不能有“一劳永逸”的思想。
    加强党的领导，是做好一切工作的根本保证。几年来无数事实证明，在鞍钢这样一个现代化的企业中，党的工作必须加强，党必须领导一切，而且也能够领导一切。实行党委统一领导，不但不会妨碍各个部门的工作，而且在党委的统一领导下，会使各个部门的工作更协调，上下更协调，思想一致，步调一致，团结一致，共同为实现党所提出的统一目标而奋斗。企业里的党组织，要实行大权独揽，小权分散，发挥各部门的组织作用，实行党委领导下的厂长负责制，发挥工会、共青团的作用。企业里的党组织，最主要的任务就是根据上级要求和本企业的具体情况，不断地提出新的任务，不断地发动群众，领导群众胜利地完成国家计划。这就要求我们在每一个时期善于抓住中心，提出明确的奋斗目标，发动广大群众，向这一目标去奋斗。中心抓住了，目标明确了，就会带动全面，推动生产全面跃进。要善于抓思想，要深入研究经济工作，但是要透过经济工作看到思想问题，特别是要抓住阻碍运动前进的带有普遍性的思想问题。把思想问题抓住了，解决了思想问题，也就推动了工作。当然，在解决思想问题的同时，也要解决实际问题，使工作愈作愈细致，尽可能地接近实际或者符合实际。要善于抓组织，抓党的组织、行政组织、工会组织、共青团组织。首先要这些组织为中心工作服务，同时也就加强了这些部门的工作。要在运动中注意考查党员、考查干部、发展党员、培养干部。要善于抓两头，带中间，注意发现新的东西，注意总结先进经验；同时又注意加强薄弱环节，注意帮助落后。鞍钢的经验证明，党组织抓住群众运动，通过大搞群众运动，来完成经济建设任务，其结果就不只是经济上的，而是思想、组织、经济上的全面丰收。企业党组织，要组织干部认真地学习毛泽东思想和党的路线、方针、政策，注意开展批评和自我批评，同不良倾向作斗争。特别是要不断地反对右倾，反对资产阶级个人主义，在思想一致的基础上达到团结一致。
    几年来，鞍钢在加强党的领导、大搞群众运动、组织生产跃进方面，虽然取得了很大成绩，也积累了一些经验；但是，还有不少的缺点和问题。随着国家经济建设和科学研究事业的高速度地发展，鞍钢必须而且也应该更好地发挥钢铁基地的作用。1960年是更好更全面跃进的一年，鞍钢担负着比过去更加繁重而光荣的任务。在不增加新设备的情况下，要生产出更多更好更新的钢铁产品；要向高（级）、大（型）、精（密）、尖（端）方向进军；要以更多的人力、物力支援全国。因此，必须继续坚持党的总路线，坚持政治挂帅，大鼓干劲，防止和克服骄傲自满、松劲情绪，兢兢业业，努力做好我们的工作，把群众运动推向新的高潮，在实现1960年开门红的基础上，乘胜前进，切实做到月月红、季季红、红到底，大力支援全国工农业生产建设事业的大跃进。
