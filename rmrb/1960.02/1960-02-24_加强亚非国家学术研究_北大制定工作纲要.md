    Strengthening Academic Research on Asian and African Countries
    Peking University Formulates Work Outline

    In September 1959, Peking University organized relevant personnel from the departments of philosophy, economics, law, history, and oriental languages to discuss the issue of strengthening academic research on Asian and African countries and determined that they would collaborate. This research work has now begun, with participants including veteran experts engaged in academic research on Asian and African countries, such as Ji Xianlin and Zhou Yiliang, and more than ten others, as well as a group of young teachers who have grown up since liberation and possess a certain research capability, and a group of young students.

    In order to strengthen leadership over this work, they have formulated a three-year scientific research outline. The outline stipulates that, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they will fully study and absorb the research achievements of the Soviet Union, and within three years, lay a solid foundation for large-scale academic research on Asian and African countries in the future, and achieve relatively outstanding results in certain areas. The outline determines that in terms of region, the focus will be on Japan, India, and the Arab world, while appropriate research will also be conducted on other Asian and African countries; in terms of time, the focus will be on modern and contemporary times, while also studying some special topics on ancient times and translating some relevant materials; in terms of discipline, the focus will be on philosophy and history, while a certain research force will also be allocated to economics and law.

    The outline determines that more than 30 special research projects and more than 10 data construction tasks will be completed within three years.

    加强亚非国家学术研究
    北大制定工作纲要
    北京大学于1959年9月组织了有关系研究了加强对亚非国家的学术研究工作的问题，确定了哲学、经济、法律、历史、东方语言等系的有关人员进行协作。现在这项研究工作已经开始，参加者有从事亚非国家学术研究的老专家如季羡林、周一良等十余人，也有一批在解放后成长起来的、具有一定研究能力的青年教师，还有一批青年学生。
    为了加强对这一工作的领导，他们制定了三年科学研究纲要。纲要中规定：在毛泽东思想指导下，充分学习和吸收苏联的研究成果，在三年内将为今后大规模地开展对亚非国家的学术研究工作打下坚实基础，并在某些方面要作出较突出的成绩。纲要确定在地域方面以日本、印度、阿拉伯为重点，对其他亚非国家也进行适当的研究；在时间方面以近代、现代为重点，同时也研究一些关于古代的专题和翻译一些有关的资料；在学科方面以哲学、历史为重点，在经济、法律等方面也配备一定的研究力量。
    纲要确定三年内共完成三十余项专题研究，十余项资料建设工作。
