　　On February 24th, just as the US President was on the rostrum of the Brazilian Congress, touting the importance of underdeveloped countries relying on foreign "aid," on the other side of the Pacific, other underdeveloped countries receiving "US aid" were issuing alarmed cries for help, as if encountering a fire.

　　What disaster occurred? It turned out that the United States, according to "Public Law 480" (one of the methods of "US aid"), was dumping 700,000 tons of rice in the Far East, causing rice-exporting countries in the Far East like Thailand to suffer unspeakably. Thailand suffered from the US dumping of rice last year, and although the price of grain plummeted, it still could not sell 150,000 tons of rice. Now that US rice is flooding in again, how can Thailand possibly cope? Therefore, Thai newspapers have criticized it, and the Thai cabinet has had to decide to authorize the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Economy to hold negotiations with the US government in order to prevent the US from seizing Thailand's rice market.

　　The United States boasts that the purpose of "US aid" is to promote the economic development of underdeveloped countries, and claims that it has achieved "great results." But the fact is that it uses the poverty of underdeveloped countries to peddle "US aid," and then uses "US aid" to create even greater poverty for underdeveloped countries. The example of Thailand is yet another proof.

　　In Aesop's Fables, there is a story about a cat and a chicken: The cat heard that some chickens in the chicken coop were sick, so it pretended to be a doctor, brought medical instruments, walked to the chicken coop, and asked them how they were feeling. The chicken replied, "Everything is fine, as long as you leave here." Such stories happen almost every day wherever the dollar goes. Even American newspapers often lament that "US aid" only earns them curses like "Yankee go home." However, fables are still instructive for many people. Anyone who invites a cat doctor will sooner or later remember the chicken's clever answer.

    避之则吉
    本月24日正当美国总统在巴西国会的讲台上鼓吹不发达国家依靠外来“援助”的重要的时候，在太平洋的彼岸，另一些接受“美援”的不发达国家却像遭遇火灾一样对美国“援助”的到来发出了惊慌的喊救命声。
    究竟出了什么祸事？原来美国根据“第四八○号公法”（美“援”的方式之一）向远东倾销七十万吨大米，使得泰国等远东大米出口国家叫苦不迭。泰国在去年就吃了美国倾销大米的苦头，谷子价格虽然大跌特跌，但仍有十五万吨米卖不掉。现在美国大米再度如潮涌来，泰国更怎能吃得消呢？因此，泰国报纸纷纷加以抨击，泰国内阁也不得不决定授权外交部和经济部同美国政府举行谈判，以阻止美国抢夺泰国的大米市场。
    美国吹嘘“美援”的目的是促进不发达国家经济的发展，并且说什么已取得了“巨大成效”。但事实是利用不发达国家的贫困来兜销“美援”，然后又利用“美援”制造不发达国家更大的贫困。泰国的例子，就是又一证明。
    “伊索寓言”上有一段讲到猫和鸡的故事：猫听说鸡栏里有鸡生病，就假装成医生，带了医学上用的器具，走到鸡栏面前，问它们病况怎样。鸡回答它说：“一切都很好，只要你离开这儿就好了”。这样的故事，几乎每天都在美元所到的地方发生。连美国报纸也常常感叹“美援”只落得换来“美国佬滚回去”的咒骂声。可是，寓言对不少人还是有教益的。谁要是请猫大夫，迟早总要想起鸡的聪明的回答。
