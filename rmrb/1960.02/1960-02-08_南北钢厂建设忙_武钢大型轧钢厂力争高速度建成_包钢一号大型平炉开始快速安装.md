Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan Dispatch: The new construction project of Wuhan Iron and Steel's large rolling mill recently officially commenced. This modern large-scale rolling mill, designed by China itself, boasts a high degree of mechanization and automation in its production process. Upon completion, it will produce large quantities of various large and medium-sized steel products and rails.

At the groundbreaking ceremony for the large rolling mill, Li Erzhong, Standing Committee Member of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee and Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, attended and congratulated the workers. He called on the builders, under the leadership of the Party, with the great assistance of the Soviet Union and the strong support of the people of the whole country, to fully utilize and promote Wuhan Iron and Steel's experience in high-speed and high-quality plant construction, and to create a new record of high-speed, high-quality, low-cost, and safe construction for the large rolling mill.

Badunov, the leader of the Soviet expert team assisting Wuhan Iron and Steel's construction, and Liu Lizi, Deputy Manager of Baotou Steel, who came from afar, also offered their congratulations at the conference, wishing for the rapid completion of Wuhan Iron and Steel's large rolling mill.

Xinhua News Agency, Baotou Dispatch: The installation of the main equipment for Baotou Steel's No. 1 large open-hearth furnace has begun.

Workers from the No. 1 team of the Metal Structure Company, responsible for installing this furnace, immediately put forward the slogan "Catch up with Wuhan Iron and Steel, surpass Wuhan Iron and Steel," determined to complete the installation task in the shortest possible time. They adopted the method of "ground assembly, overall hoisting" and have already spent four days installing over 400 tons of equipment for the lower regenerator and slag pocket of the furnace.

The civil engineering work at the steelmaking construction site has now shifted from underground to above ground, and the pipeline project has also shifted from underground trunk lines to underground branch lines. The hundred-meter-high chimney has already risen above ground. The entire construction site is now a scene of intense activity, full of the vitality of spring.

    南北钢厂建设忙
    武钢大型轧钢厂力争高速度建成
    包钢一号大型平炉开始快速安装
    据新华社武汉电　武钢大型轧钢厂新建工程最近正式开工。这座由我国自己设计的现代化大型轧钢厂，生产过程机械化、自动化程度很高，建成后将大量生产各种大中型钢材和钢轨。
    在大型轧钢厂开工典礼大会上，中共湖北省委常委、武汉市委书记处书记李尔重到会向职工们祝贺。他号召建设者们在党的领导下，在苏联伟大援助和全国人民的大力支援下，充分运用和发扬武钢高速优质的建厂经验，创造建设大型轧钢厂高速、优质、低成本、安全施工的新纪录。
    帮助武钢建设的苏联专家组长巴杜诺夫和远道前来的包钢副经理刘力子，也在大会上预祝武钢大型轧钢厂迅速建成。
    据新华社包头电　包钢一号大型平炉本体设备安装工程已经开始。
    安装这座平炉的金属结构公司一队的工人，一上阵就提出了“赶武钢、超武钢”的口号，决心用最短的时间完成安装任务。他们采用“地面组立、整体吊装”的方法，已用四天的时间安装完了平炉下部蓄热室和沉渣室的四百多吨设备。
    炼钢工地上的土建工程，现在已经由地下转到地面，管道工程也由地下干线转向地下支线。一百米高的大烟囱已经修出地面了。整个工地已是一片紧张繁忙景象，充满着春天的生气。
