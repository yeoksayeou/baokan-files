    A Magnificent View of Iron Flag Mountain
    Jiang Wenpin
    One sunny afternoon, a group of officers arrived at the location of the Xifuzhen People's Commune in Qingdao and continued north, reaching the foot of Iron Flag Mountain. During the Xuanhe era of the Song Dynasty, a temple was built here, named Baifu Nunnery (Hundred Blessings Nunnery). The dense bamboo forest, shrouding the main hall, created quite a scenic view. Moving forward, a road sign indicated the changes to this mountain.
    It turned out that the Baifu Nunnery Orchard was originally composed of seven barren mountains, including Iron Flag Mountain and Seven Star Terrace, all completely devoid of vegetation. Before liberation, due to the enemy's cruel destruction, not a single blade of grass grew on the mountains. To transform the barren mountains into a fruit-filled paradise, people, under the leadership of the Party, began construction in December of last year. They newly opened 600 mu of contour terraces, 400 mu of "three-in-one" terraces, 500 mu of horizontal ditches, dug 280,000 fish-scale pits, and newly built 12,800 meters of mountain and ring roads...
    Currently, the entire orchard has planted 190,000 fruit trees of various kinds, 200,000 Masson pines, and 200 mu of medicinal herbs. It is estimated that by 1965, it will be possible to harvest 3.7 million jin of grapes and 200,000 jin of apples. By then, the various fragrant fruits produced here will be continuously transported to all parts of the country.
    To the left of the old temple, there was a red poster that read:
    Iron Flag Mountain, peak piercing the clouds,
    Has slumbered in a dream for a thousand years,
    Even the ancient Baifu Nunnery,
    Has been sparsely populated since ancient times.
    Looking back, ten years ago,
    A great battle was fought on Iron Flag Mountain,
    People's soldiers annihilated the bandit army,
    And the red flag was planted on Iron Flag Mountain.
    In the peaceful years of great construction,
    The leaping advance bugle shook the mountains and rivers,
    At the Party's call,
    Thousands of heroes gathered before the temple.
    Wind and snow cannot defeat the heroes' will,
    The cold of winter is of no concern,
    Working hard in the dead of winter,
    Barren mountains are transformed into fruit-filled paradises.
    An old commune member came over and introduced: "This is a branch of Mount Lao. In the past, the people in the mountains were always disappointed and returned empty-handed, unable to find the treasure they sought to escape poverty. Now the treasure has been found." I'll sing you a folk song:
    Mount Lao is good, Mount Lao is good,
    Mount Lao has ten thousand treasures,
    Everyone has been searching for thousands of years,
    Searching and searching, but unable to find them.
    Chairman Mao, the Communist Party,
    Lead us to find the treasure,
    The treasure is on the barren mountain,
    Curing the barren mountain is the treasure.
    Barren mountains are transformed into fruit-filled paradises,
    The people in the mountainous areas are overjoyed.
    After listening to the elder's introduction, a clear picture of the mountain and water management here emerged in my mind. People stood at the foot of the mountain and looked up, seeing:
    The majestic Iron Flag Mountain,
    The sky connected to the mountain, the mountain connected to the sky,
    The peaks rise,
    Piercing through the clouds.
    A field of fish-scale pits,
    Speckled and dotted,
    What a magnificent sight!
    Under the guidance of the host, the sightseers passed through the mountainside in a single line. As the floating clouds moved, the people seemed to be standing in the clouds. Standing high and looking down, the fish-scale pits and interception ditches looked like waves stirred up on the sea, and the terraces at the foot of the mountain were even more magnificent than the stone steps in front of Zijin Mountain. The heroes in the mountains spread from the mountaintop to the foot of the mountain, red flags fluttered, and the sound of hoes shook the mountains and the earth.
    After seeing it, everyone couldn't help but join the ranks of labor. Some planted a peach and plum tree; some planted a Rhododendron simsii; some planted a mountain-protecting pine tree. At the time of parting, the soldiers and civilians were reluctant to part. The People's Liberation Army comrades, walking and looking back at the surrounding mountains, praised them endlessly:
    High mountains, distant mountains, forest mountains,
    Nearby mountains, low mountains, fruit mountains;
    Small dates and grapes are connected in pieces,
    The mountains are full of apple orchards,
    There is a long flowing stream on the mountain without a spring,
    Water canals and river channels surround the mountain.
    All sources converge on the Party's leadership,
    A thousand good things and ten thousand good things come from the general line,
    Everyone listens to the Party's words,
    The commune's power is boundless! (Attached image)

    胜观铁锜山
    姜文品
    一个风和日丽的下午，有一批军官来到青岛惜福镇人民公社所在地，继续向北进发，到达铁锜山下。宋时宣和年间在此立下一座庙宇，名曰百福庵。竹林茂密，笼罩大殿，倒有一番景色。再往前走去，只见一个路牌，写明了这座山的变化。
    原来这百福庵果林场，原系铁锜山、七星台等七个光秃如洗的荒山。解放前，由于敌人的残酷破坏，遍山寸草不生。为变荒山为花果山，人们在党的领导下，去年12月动工兴建。新开围山梯田六百亩、三合一梯田四百亩、水平沟五百亩、挖鱼鳞坑二十八万个、新开通山和环山公路一万二千八百米……
    现在全场共栽植各种果树十九万株、马尾松二十万株、药材二百亩。预计到1965年，可收葡萄三百七十万斤、苹果二十万斤。到那时，此地盛产的各种香果，可以源源不断地运往祖国各地。
    古庙左侧，有一张红帖，上写：
    铁锜山，顶云尖，
    千年沉睡在梦间，
    连那古老百福庵，
    自古以来少人烟。
    屈指算，十年前，
    铁锜山上摆大战，
    人民战士灭匪军，
    红旗插在铁锜山。
    和平年间大建设，
    跃进号角震山川，
    党的号召一声下，
    千万英雄会庙前。
    风雪难敌英雄志，
    天寒地冻只等闲，
    数九寒天动干戈，
    荒山变成花果山。
    一位老社员走过来介绍说：这里，是崂山支脉。过去山里人为寻找富源，摆脱贫困，总是山宝不能到手，扫兴而归。如今山宝找到了。我念只山歌你们听：
    崂山好，崂山好，
    崂山之上万件宝，
    千年以来人人找，
    找来找去找不到。
    毛主席，共产党，
    领导我们来找宝，
    宝贝就在荒山上，
    治好荒山便是宝。
    荒山变成花果山，
    山区人民乐涛涛。
    听了这位长者的介绍，对此地的山水治理，脑子里已勾出一个轮廓了。人们站立山脚，仰首一看，只见：
    巍峨的铁锜山，
    天连山，山连天，
    群峰耸立，
    穿过云端。
    一片鱼鳞坑，
    斑斑点点，
    好不壮观！
    观景人在主人引导下，单列从山腹穿过，浮云移动，人儿如同站在云间。居高临下，举目四观，鱼鳞坑截水沟如海上吹起的波涛，山脚下的梯田比紫金山前的石阶还要壮丽可观。山里的英雄从山尖布满山脚，红旗招展，镐声震川，山摇地动。
    看罢，大家情不自禁地都投入了劳动行列。有的栽下一棵桃李；有的植了一棵迎山红；有的栽了一棵护山松。临别时，军民依依难舍。解放军同志，边走边回首环顾四山，赞不绝口：
    高山远山森林山，
    近山低山花果山；
    小枣葡萄连成片，
    满山都是苹果园，
    山上无泉长流水，
    水渠河道围山转。
    万源归一是党领导，
    千好万好是总路线，
    人人都听党的话，
    公社威力大无边！（附图片）
