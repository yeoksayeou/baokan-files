　　This newspaper reports News: The oil pressing workshop of Siping City Oil and Wine Factory, where Li Chuanjiang, the national flag-bearer of the oil industry, works, has transformed from manual screw pressing to solvent extraction, greatly increasing the oil yield and ending the history of manual operation. The workshop has reduced its workforce from over 160 workers to 36, while the daily output has increased by more than half.

　　The biggest advantage of solvent extraction is that it increases the oil yield—from 77.94% to 92.52%, with every hundred jin of soybeans yielding three to four jin more oil than mechanical pressing. According to their processing capacity, they can produce 840 tons more oil annually, which is equivalent to saving 6,000 tons of soybeans, and the cost is also reduced by 24.38% compared to the past.

    李川江车间实现机械化
    每百斤大豆多出油三、四斤　全年可增产840吨
　　本报讯　全国油脂工业旗帜李川江所在的车间——四平市油酒厂制油车间，由用人力螺旋榨榨油改变为浸出制油，大大提高了出油率，结束了手工操作的历史。全车间由一百六十多名工人减少到三十六名，日产量却比过去增加一倍半还多。
   　浸出法制油，最大的好处是提高了出油率——由77．94％提高到92．52％，每百斤大豆比机榨多出油三斤到四斤。按他们的加工能力计算，全年可多产油八百四十吨，等于节省六千吨大豆，成本也比过去降低了24．38％。
