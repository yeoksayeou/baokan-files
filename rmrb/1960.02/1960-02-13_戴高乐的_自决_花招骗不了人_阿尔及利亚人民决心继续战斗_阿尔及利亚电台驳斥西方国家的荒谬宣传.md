Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 8th. The "Voice of the Republic of Algeria" radio station said tonight, "The Western countries and imperialist France must know that there will be no ceasefire unless France agrees to our just demands for complete freedom and immediate independence."

The radio station made these remarks while commenting on Western propaganda, which said that the Algerian people should believe in the sincerity of De Gaulle's promise to grant Algeria self-determination, and that they should negotiate a ceasefire with De Gaulle.

The radio station said that this propaganda is tantamount to demanding that the Algerian people surrender to De Gaulle. The West should know that the Algerian people will not lay down their arms simply because of De Gaulle's promises, because such promises are often contradictory to his own words and deeds.

The radio station also said that the Algerian people do not care which of the two, De Gaulle and the French extreme colonialists, wins in this struggle, because they are both mortal enemies of the Algerian people and represent imperialism.

The radio station concluded by saying that the only solution lies in the hands of the Algerian people and the Algerian Liberation Army. This solution is to continue the struggle until the imperialists agree to the just demands of the Algerian people.

    戴高乐的“自决”花招骗不了人
    阿尔及利亚人民决心继续战斗
    阿尔及利亚电台驳斥西方国家的荒谬宣传
    新华社开罗8日电　“阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台今天晚上说，“必须让西方国家和帝国主义的法国知道，除非法国同意我们的完全自由和立即独立的正当要求，否则将不会有停火。”
    这家电台是在评论西方的宣传时说这番话的，西方的这类宣传说：阿尔及利亚人民应该相信戴高乐答应阿尔及利亚获得自决的诺言的诚意，他们应该同戴高乐谈判停火。
    这家电台说，这些宣传等于要求阿尔及利亚人民向戴高乐投降。应该让西方知道，阿尔及利亚人民将不会只是由于戴高乐的诺言而放下武器，因为这种诺言同他自己的言行是经常矛盾的。
    这家电台还说，阿尔及利亚人民对戴高乐和法国极端殖民主义分子之间的哪一方在他们这次斗争中获胜并不介意，因为他们都是阿尔及利亚人民的死敌，他们所代表的都是帝国主义。
    这家电台最后说，唯一的解决办法操在阿尔及利亚人民和阿尔及利亚解放军的手里。这种解决办法就是继续进行斗争，直到帝国主义分子同意阿尔及利亚人民的正当要求时为止。
