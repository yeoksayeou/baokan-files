Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Soviet Conference of Representatives from All Circles for Disarmament, which opened in Moscow on the 15th, closed on the 16th.

    The Chairman of the Soviet Peace Defense Committee, Nikolai Tikhonov, delivered a report at the meeting entitled "The Soviet People Fight for Complete and Thorough Disarmament."

    In his report, Tikhonov said that the whole world expects the upcoming summit meeting in Paris to achieve success in disarmament and further relaxation of the international situation. He then said that the world public also expects that the ten-nation disarmament committee will soon begin constructive discussions on specific disarmament proposals and the drafting of disarmament agreements between countries.

    Tikhonov emphasized that the Soviet public felt very regretful about France's testing of atomic devices in the Sahara. He said that the atomic explosion in the Sahara would not fail to please those who are doing everything possible to obstruct the conclusion of an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapons tests.

    Tikhonov said that the public in all countries hopes that the Geneva talks on the non-continuation of nuclear weapons tests will be successfully concluded. The Soviet Peace Defense Committee is willing to discuss urgent issues of working together for peace in a friendly atmosphere with any organization.

    At the closing meeting, a letter of appeal to all peace-loving forces in the world, a resolution on not continuing nuclear weapons tests, and a resolution on approving the further reduction of the Soviet armed forces were also adopted.

    The letter of appeal to all peace-loving forces in the world calls on Western countries to follow the example of the Soviet Union's unilateral reduction of its armed forces by 1.2 million people, and calls on all peace-loving forces to unite and help the upcoming conference on complete and thorough disarmament with supervision to achieve successful results.

    The resolution on not continuing nuclear weapons tests points out that the fact that the major powers possessing nuclear weapons have not yet concluded an agreement on the permanent prohibition of testing all nuclear weapons makes all well-intentioned people uneasy. Recently, this uneasiness has been particularly aggravated by the United States' publication of a statement threatening to resume nuclear testing.

    The resolution believes that the road to concluding an agreement is open, and that what is hindering the reaching of an agreement is the United States' unwillingness to prohibit underground nuclear weapons tests.

    The resolution also condemns the French government's testing of atomic weapons in the Sahara.

    The resolution on approving the law passed by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union at its recent meeting on further reducing the Soviet armed forces by one-third points out that this law is the practical implementation of the great plan for complete and thorough disarmament.

    More than 800 representatives from all parts of the Soviet Union, including workers, collective farmers, scholars, writers, actors, and religious figures, attended the conference. Invited guests included representatives of the World Peace Council, scientists, writers, and social activists from China, Bulgaria, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, India, France, Japan, Algeria, and representatives of religious circles in the United States.

    苏联各界举行争取裁军会议  呼吁一切爱好和平的力量联合起来
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：15日在莫斯科开幕的苏联各界争取裁军代表会议已经在16日闭幕。
    苏联保卫和平委员会主席吉洪诺夫在会上作了题为“苏联人民争取全面彻底裁军”的报告。
    吉洪诺夫在报告中说，全世界都期待将在巴黎举行的最高级会议能在裁军和进一步缓和国际局势方面取得成就。他接着说，世界公众还期待，十国裁军委员会将会很快开始建设性地讨论具体的裁军建议和草拟各国裁军协定。
    吉洪诺夫着重指出，法国在撒哈拉试验原子装置的消息使苏联公众感到非常遗憾。他说，撒哈拉的原子爆炸不会不使那些千方百计地阻挠缔结停止核武器试验协定的人高兴。
    吉洪诺夫说，各国公众希望日内瓦不继续试验核武器的谈判圆满结束。苏联保卫和平委员会愿意同任何组织在友好的气氛中讨论为和平而共同工作的迫切问题。
    在闭幕会议上还通过了致世界所有爱好和平力量的呼吁书、关于不继续试验核武器的决议和关于赞同再一次裁减苏联武装部队的决议。
    致世界各国所有爱好和平力量的呼吁书要求西方国家效法苏联单方面裁减自己武装部队一百二十万人的榜样，并且号召一切爱好和平的力量联合起来和帮助即将举行的全面彻底和有监督裁军会谈获得成功的结果。
    关于不继续试验核武器的决议指出，拥有核武器的各大国现在仍未缔结有关永远禁止试验一切核武器的协议这一事实，使所有善良的人们都感到不安。最近，由于美国发表了一个具有恢复核试验威胁的声明，这种不安就特别地加剧了。
    决议认为，缔结协议的道路是敞开着的，而阻碍达成协议的是美国不愿意禁止在地下试验核武器。
    决议还谴责法国政府在撒哈拉试验原子武器。
    关于赞同苏联最高苏维埃在最近一次会议上通过关于再一次裁减苏联武装部队三分之一的法案的决议指出，这个法案是实际上执行了伟大的全面彻底裁军计划。
    出席代表会议的有来自苏联各地的工人、集体农民、学者、作家、演员、宗教界人士等八百多名代表。应邀出席会议的来宾有世界和平理事会代表，中国、保加利亚、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国、印度、法国、日本、阿尔及利亚等国的科学家、作家和社会活动家以及美国宗教界的代表。
