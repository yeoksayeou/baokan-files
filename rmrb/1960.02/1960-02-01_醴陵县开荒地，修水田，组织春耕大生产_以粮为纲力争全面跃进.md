Liling County Reclaims Wasteland, Builds Paddy Fields, and Organizes Spring Ploughing for Large-Scale Production
Taking Grain as the Key Link to Strive for Overall Leap Forward

(Our dispatch) Hunan's Liling County adheres to the agricultural production policy of taking grain as the key link and striving for overall leap forward, and is organizing spring ploughing for large-scale production.

In the past month, Liling County has adopted a method of combining top-down and bottom-up approaches to plan this year's production. The broad masses and cadres are determined to increase grain output more than last year, and also demand to greatly increase the unit area yield of cash crops. However, some cadres and commune members believe that growing cash crops is more valuable than growing grain crops and generates more cash income, advocating growing more cash crops and reducing the area of grain cultivation. The county party committee believes that these ideas are obstacles to implementing the policy of "taking grain as the key link and striving for overall leap forward," and organized cadres and commune members throughout the county to discuss the ever-increasing need for grain for national construction and people's lives, and the relationship between developing grain production and developing the entire agricultural production. After discussion, the vast majority of cadres and the masses realized that grain production is the foundation of the entire agricultural production, and only after producing a certain amount of grain can we better develop cash crops and other production. Therefore, in agricultural production, we must implement the policy of "taking grain as the key link and striving for overall leap forward."

Subsequently, the county party committee adopted specific measures to expand the cultivated area, solve the contradiction between grain crops and cash crops and feed crops competing for land, so that the implementation of the policy of "taking grain as the key link and striving for overall leap forward" can be effectively guaranteed. Liling County has more than 570,000 agricultural population, but only 600,800 mu of cultivated land, with an average of just over one mu of cultivated land per person. In order to meet the ever-growing needs of national construction and people's lives for grain, this year's grain production should have a greater increase than last year, and the planting area needs to be appropriately expanded. However, basic construction such as water conservancy construction and road construction this winter and spring has taken up 20,000 to 30,000 mu of cultivated land; the area of feed land needs to be increased this year; and the planting area of cash crops should not be less than last year. Therefore, there is not enough land, and the contradiction between grain crops, cash crops, and feed crops competing for land is very prominent. After analyzing the local situation, the county party committee believes that there is a way to solve this contradiction. There are still more than 400,000 mu of wasteland with a slope of less than 25 degrees suitable for reclamation in the county; with the excavation of new canals, some original dry land can be converted into paddy fields; at the same time, there are still some land that can be utilized near highways, railways, reservoirs, canal sides, and in front and behind houses, and can even be converted into paddy fields. The county party committee decided to reclaim 240,000 mu of wasteland and convert 40,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields. In this way, the county's cultivated land area will be expanded from 600,800 mu last year to 848,000 mu. According to these cultivated lands, the planting crops will be arranged, and the grain cultivated land will be expanded from 540,000 mu last year to 737,000 mu; the cash crop land will be increased from 30,000 mu last year to 37,000 mu; the vegetable land will be increased from 20,000 mu to 30,000 mu; and the feed land will be increased from 20,000 mu to 60,000 mu. The call of the county party committee was immediately responded to by the farmers throughout the county. Starting from December 23 last year, 100,000 commune members in the county broke through the boundaries of teams and communes, carried out large-scale collaboration, concentrated superior forces, and besieged one mountain after another. Within seven days, they reclaimed 160,000 mu of wasteland, and planted wheat on 120,000 mu while reclaiming. They plan to launch another blitz after the Spring Festival to realize the plan to reclaim 240,000 mu of wasteland.

Liling County has also taken many measures to strive for grain to take the lead and achieve overall leap forward. First, earnestly implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture and strive for high yield and more harvest. Now, the county is carrying out preparatory activities centered on accumulating fertilizer. The county's 150,000 labor force is accumulating soil fertilizer, cultivating green manure, rushing to manufacture local chemical fertilizer, and collecting household fertilizer. After the Spring Festival, a campaign will be launched to select 20 jin of fine seeds per person, so that all seeds will be purified into fine varieties. The work of improving low-yield fields and leveling land is also being carried out intensively. The winter water conservancy project has been basically completed, and at present, it is rushing to complete a few finishing touches and doing a good job in water storage. Second, strive to increase the multiple cropping index, and strive to keep every inch of land busy all year round. The 130,000 mu of paddy fields that have been planted with spring harvest crops, except for 50,000 mu reserved as late rice seedling fields that only grow one season of rice, the rest will break the conventional rules and grow double-cropping rice. In dry land, multiple cropping, intercropping, and crop rotation should be implemented, so that the multiple cropping area of 864,000 mu of cultivated land will reach 1,547,000 mu. Third, when arranging commodity bases, all people's communes must ensure the completion of the state's grain purchase tasks and meet the needs of the commune for rations, seeds, and feed; when production brigades arrange commodity bases, they must also ensure that they meet the needs of the brigade for rations, seeds, and feed under the unified leadership of the commune. Fourth, 70% of the county's 240,000 laborers will be devoted to agriculture. Among them, except for 15,000 people who operate cash crops, the vast majority of the labor force will engage in grain production. Fifth, mobilize the masses to fully utilize scattered land and grow more and harvest more.

    醴陵县开荒地，修水田，组织春耕大生产
    以粮为纲力争全面跃进
    本报讯　湖南醴陵县坚持以粮为纲全面跃进的农业生产方针，组织春耕大生产。
    最近一个月来，醴陵县采取了自上而下和自下而上相结合的办法，规划今年生产。广大群众和干部都决心使粮食产量比去年有更多的增加，也要求大大提高经济作物的单位面积产量。但是，有一些干部和社员认为：种经济作物比种粮食作物价值高，现金收入多，主张多种经济作物，缩减粮食耕地面积。县委认为这些思想是贯彻执行“以粮为纲，全面跃进”方针的障碍，便组织全县干部和社员联系到国家建设和人民生活对粮食日益增长的需要，联系发展粮食生产和发展整个农业生产的关系，展开了讨论。经过讨论，绝大多数干部和群众都认识到：粮食生产是整个农业生产的基础，只有生产了一定数量的粮食以后，才能更好地去发展经济作物和其他生产。因此在农业生产中，必须执行“以粮为纲，全面跃进”的方针。
    接着，县委又采取具体措施，扩大耕地面积，解决粮食作物同经济作物、饲料争地的矛盾，使贯彻执行“以粮为纲，全面跃进”的方针得到有力的保证。醴陵县有五十七万多农业人口，只有耕地六十万零八千亩，每人平均仅仅一亩多一点耕地。为了满足国家建设和人民生活对粮食日益增长的需要，今年粮食生产应该比去年有更大的增长，需要适当地扩大播种面积。但是去冬今春修水利、筑道路等等基本建设占去了二、三万亩耕地；今年饲料地需要增加；经济作物种植面积也不应少于去年。因此，土地不够用，粮食同经济作物、饲料争地的矛盾很突出。县委分析当地情况以后，认为有办法解决这个矛盾，全县还有四十万亩以上坡度在二十五度以下宜于开垦的荒地；随着新渠道的开挖，原来一些旱地可以改为水田；同时，公路、铁路、水库附近，渠道旁边，屋前屋后，也还有一些土地可以利用，甚至可以改为水田。县委决定开荒二十四万亩，并改四万亩旱地为水田。这样，全县的耕地面积就将由去年的六十万零八千亩扩大到八十四万八千亩。根据这些耕地来安排种植作物，粮食耕地由去年的五十四万亩扩大到七十三万七千亩；经济作物地由去年的三万亩增加到三万七千亩；蔬菜地由两万亩增加到三万亩；饲料地由二万亩增加到六万亩。县委的号召，立即得到全县农民的响应。从去年12月23日开始，全县十万社员打破队界、社界，开展大协作，集中优势兵力，围攻一个又一个山头。七天之内开荒十六万亩，并且边垦边种，有十二万亩种上了小麦。他们准备在春节过后，再来一次突击运动，实现开荒二十四万亩的计划。
    醴陵县还采取了许多措施，力争粮食带头，全面跃进。第一、认真执行农业“八字宪法”，力争高产多收。现在，这个县正开展以积肥为中心的备耕活动。全县十五万劳动大军大积土肥，培育绿肥，赶造土化肥和收集家肥。春节后就开展一次每人粒选良种二十斤的运动，使全部种子达到良种纯种化。改良低产田、平整土地的工作也正在紧张地进行。冬修水利任务已基本完成，目前正在突击少数扫尾工程和做好蓄水工作。第二、努力提高复种指数，力争一年四季寸土不闲。已经种上了春收作物的十三万亩水田，除五万亩留作晚稻秧田只种一季水稻外，其余的都要打破常规，种上双季稻。在旱土里要实行复种、间种、轮种，使八十六万四千亩耕地复种面积达到一百五十四万七千亩。第三、各人民公社在安排商品基地时，都要保证完成国家粮食征购任务，满足本社口粮、种子、饲料的需要；生产大队安排商品基地时，也要在公社统一领导下，保证满足本大队对口粮、种子、饲料的需要。第四、全县二十四万多个劳动力，抽出70％搞农业。其中除一万五千人经营经济作物外，绝大部分劳动力都要从事粮食生产。第五、发动群众，充分利用零星土地，多种多收。
