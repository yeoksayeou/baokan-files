    Jiangxi Communist Labor University Resolutely Implements the Party's Education Policy
    Learning Through Labor, Laboring Through Learning
    Cultivating a Large Number of Talents for Mountain Area Construction, Creating a Large Amount of Wealth for the Country
    (Our dispatch) Nanchang – The Communist Labor University, established in more than one hundred mountainous areas of Jiangxi Province to cultivate talents for the construction of new socialist mountainous areas, under the glorious illumination of the Party's education policy, has achieved tremendous achievements in both labor and teaching over the past year.
    The Communist Labor University was born in the Great Leap Forward of 1958. It is a new type of university that combines work-study and part-work, part-study. It currently has one main campus and eighty-seven branch campuses, with fourteen attached labor technical schools, totaling 55,000 students. The campuses are all located in mountainous areas, and 92.7% of the students are children of workers and peasants. The hundreds of thousands of square meters of school buildings, production bases, and practice fields were all built by the teachers and students through self-reliance. All the students' learning and living expenses are also completely self-sufficient through students studying and working at the same time. Therefore, it has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of working people, who call it their "Worker-Peasant University."
    The school regards labor as the first lesson after students enroll. Through labor training, students have cultivated the spirit of perseverance, bravery, and indomitable struggle against difficulties. A student named Wei Guoqing injured one hand during labor. The teacher advised him to return to school, but he insisted on not leaving the construction site. He said, "I still have one hand that can work!" He stayed on the construction site and sharpened knives for everyone. One class worked straight into the night to complete the task of cutting one thousand bamboo poles a day before finishing work. Through labor, students are eager to make political progress, and more than 70% of the students have applied to join the Party and the League. Now, Party and League members account for 60% of the total number of students in the school. Over the past year, the school has also produced a large number of "Five-Good" students who are good in ideology, study, labor, health, and morality, as well as activists and model workers in socialist construction. According to statistics from nine branch campuses, including Deshengguan, there are 764 "Five-Good" students, accounting for one-quarter of the total number; there are 87 activists in socialist construction, five of whom were named provincial-level activists in socialist construction.
    Because the Communist Labor University adheres to putting politics in command, especially earnestly implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor, the quality of education has greatly improved over the past year. Although the students in this school are older and have varying levels of education, they have all participated in certain labor training, have certain practical knowledge, and are especially the children of poor workers and peasants with a strong desire for knowledge and a very high enthusiasm for learning. Now the school's courses have entered the teaching process of the second academic year. Those who originally had a higher elementary education level are now studying the courses of the third year of junior high school; the junior high school students who enrolled are already studying the courses of the third year of senior high school, and their grades are very good. For example, in the Sericulture Branch School, students who received a total score of 5 accounted for 36.1%, those who received 4 accounted for 44.7%, those who received 3 accounted for 16.9%, and those who failed accounted for only 2.3%. The professional courses of the Labor University are closely related to mountain area production. They regard their production bases as production sites for self-sufficiency, and also as vast natural laboratories for learning; they learn through labor and labor through learning, thereby combining theoretical knowledge from books with knowledge gained from practice, and improving the quality of learning. For example, the Forestry Department of the General School offers five courses: Dendrology, Silviculture, Forest Mensuration, Forest Protection, and Plant Physiology. Among the forty-six students in Class 405 of this department, forty-five students passed the Dendrology exam, accounting for 97.8%, and only one person failed. All students passed Silviculture, and thirty-one students scored 4 or above, accounting for 67%; all other subjects also had good grades. More importantly, through study and productive labor, students have generally mastered multiple production techniques such as planting trees, afforestation, seed selection, seedling cultivation, and preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests. According to statistics from only 360 people at the Linchi Branch School, 30 people have learned general agricultural and forestry production techniques, 60 people have learned winemaking techniques, 40 people have learned brick and tile making, and 230 people have learned charcoal burning. While mastering advanced scientific knowledge and practical operating techniques, the students have also created a large amount of wealth for the country. According to preliminary statistics, the General School and various branch schools have built 86 farms, 17 forest farms, with a cultivated area of 17,946 mu, a forest area of 142,050 mu, operated 161 various small factories, and raised 16,000 pigs and 10,837 chickens and ducks. According to statistics from the General School and 57 branch schools alone, the total output value reached 10,013,5594 yuan, and the net income reached 8,393,412 yuan; each student has an average annual income of about 240 yuan, achieving self-sufficiency with a surplus.
    The reason why the Communist Labor University has been able to achieve such tremendous achievements in the past year is mainly because it has resolutely implemented the Party's education policy, strengthened the Party's leadership, adhered to putting politics in command, and vigorously promoted mass movements. From the beginning of its establishment, it thoroughly criticized the viewpoints and educational ideology of the bourgeoisie in running schools, insisted that education serve proletarian politics, resolutely implemented the combination of education and productive labor, faced the mountainous areas, faced the workers and peasants, faced reality, and used the principles of communist education to cultivate talents who are both red and expert. When they started, they had nothing in the way of school buildings, teaching materials, or teachers, so they relied on the masses, mobilized the masses, relied on their own efforts, and started from scratch to build schools in barren mountains; teaching materials were compiled by themselves while studying and researching; most of the teachers were cadres who went to the mountains and demobilized military officers who lacked teaching experience. Under the leadership of the Party, they pooled their wisdom and worked together with one heart and one mind, organized teaching and research groups to teach and learn from each other, and learned while teaching; without teaching aids, teachers and students worked together to make them. In this way, the school was not only built, but also run very well. This provides good experience for running work-study, part-work, part-study universities, and rapidly cultivating construction talents for building new socialist mountainous areas.

### 江西共产主义劳动大学坚决贯彻党的教育方针  在劳动中学习　在学习中劳动  培养了大批建设山区人材　为国家创造了大量财富

    江西共产主义劳动大学坚决贯彻党的教育方针
    在劳动中学习　在学习中劳动
    培养了大批建设山区人材　为国家创造了大量财富
    本报讯　建立在江西省一百多个山区、为建设社会主义新山区培养建设人材的共产主义劳动大学，在党的教育方针的光辉照耀下，一年多来，无论在劳动和教学方面，都取得了巨大成绩。
    共产主义劳动大学是在1958年大跃进中诞生的，是一所勤工俭学、半工半读的新型大学。它目前有一个总校和八十七所分校，并附设了十四所劳动技术学校，共有学生五万五千人。校址都设立在山区，92．7％的学生，都是工农子女。学校的几十万平方米的校舍、生产基地、实习场地，都是师生白手起家办起来的。学生的一切学习生活费用，也完全依靠学生一面读书、一面劳动自供自给。因此，它受到了广大劳动人民的热烈欢迎，把它称为自己的“工农大学”。
    学校把劳动做为学生入学后的第一课。通过劳动锻炼，培养了学生的坚毅勇敢、不向困难低头的顽强斗争精神。有一个叫魏国清的学生，在劳动中一只手受了伤，老师劝他回校，他坚持不离开工地，他说：“还有一只手，可以干！”他还是留在工地上，给大家磨刀。有一个班为了完成一天砍一千根竹子的任务，直干到黑夜，才收工。学生们通过劳动，政治上迫切要求进步，70％以上的学生要求入党入团。现在，全校的党团员，已占总人数的60％。一年多来，学校还涌现了大量思想好、读书好、劳动好、身体好、品德好的五好学生、社会主义建设积极分子和劳动模范。据德胜关等九个分校的统计，五好学生有七百六十四人，占总人数的四分之一；社会主义建设积极分子八十七人，其中有五人被评为全省社会主义建设积极分子。
    共产主义劳动大学由于坚持政治挂帅，特别是认真贯彻执行了教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，一年多来，教育质量有很大的提高。这个学校的学生年龄虽然较大，而且文化程度参差不齐，但他们都参加过一定的劳动锻炼，具有一定的实际知识，特别都是贫苦的工农子女，求知欲迫切，学习积极性非常高。现在学校的课程，都进入了第二学年的教学进程。原来高小程度的，现在已经学初三的课程；入学时的初中学生，已经在读高中三年级的课程，而且成绩都很好。如蚕桑分校，考试成绩总评五分的占36．1％，四分的占44．7％，三分的占16．9％，不及格的只占2．3％。劳动大学的专业课程，和山区生产有着紧密的联系。他们把自己的生产基地作为自供自给的生产场所，又是学习上的广阔的天然实验室；他们在劳动中学习，在学习中劳动，从而把书本上的理论知识和实践中得来的知识结合起来，提高了学习质量。如总校林学系开设了树木学、造林学、测树学、森林保护学、植物生理学等五门课程。该系405班四十六名学生，经考试树木学及格者四十五人，占97．8％，不及格的只有一个人。造林学全部及格，得四分以上的有三十一人，占67％；其它各科也全部成绩良好。更重要的是，同学们通过学习和生产劳动，普遍地掌握了植树、造林、选种、育苗、防治病虫害等多项生产技术。仅据琳池分校三百六十个人统计，学会了一般农林生产技术的有三十人，学会酿酒技术的六十人，学会做砖瓦的四十人，学会烧木炭的二百三十人。学生们在掌握了先进科学知识和生产实际操作技术的同时，还为国家创造了大量的财富。据初步统计，总校和各分校已建农场八十六个，林场十七个，耕地面积达一万七千九百四十六亩，林地面积十四万二千零五十亩，办各种小型工厂一百六十一个，饲养生猪一万六千头，鸡鸭一万零八百三十七只。仅据总校和五十七所分校统计，生产总值达一千零一十三万五千五百九十四元，净收益达八百三十九万三千四百十二元；每个学生平均每年约有二百四十元的收入，做到了自给有余。
    共产主义劳动大学，一年来所以能够取得这样巨大的成就，主要是坚决地贯彻了党的教育方针，加强了党的领导，坚持了政治挂帅和大搞群众运动的结果。他们从开办起，就彻底地批判了资产阶级办学的观点和教育思想，坚持教育为无产阶级政治服务，坚决地实行教育与生产劳动相结合，面向山区、面向工农、面向实际，用共产主义教育原则培养又红又专的人材。他们开办的时候，校舍、教材、师资什么都没有，就依靠群众，发动群众，自力更生，白手起家，在荒山建校；教材是一边学习、一边研究自己动手编；教师大都是缺乏教学经验的上山干部和转业军官。他们在党的领导下，群策群力同心同德，组织教研组互教互学，边学边教；没有教具，师生就共同动手做。这样，学校不仅建起来了，而且办的很好。从而为办好勤工俭学、半工半读的大学，迅速培养建设社会主义新山区的建设人材，提供了良好的经验。
