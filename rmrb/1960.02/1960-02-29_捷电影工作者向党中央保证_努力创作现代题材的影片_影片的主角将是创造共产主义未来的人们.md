Dr. František Kahuda, Czechoslovak Minister of Education and Culture, delivered a report at the meeting. In his report, he praised the achievements of the Czechoslovak film industry and pointed out that the main task facing Czechoslovak films is to depict modern life. Film art must be further improved, and more demands must be placed on film creation.

At the end of the meeting, all the participants of the meeting wrote a letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. The letter stated that Czechoslovak filmmakers believe that their main task is to: create impressive films depicting modern life. The protagonists of these films will be the people who are creating the communist future with their own labor. Film will become a huge force in the socialist cultural revolution. The policies of the Communist Party and a true understanding of the lives of the working people under the leadership of the Party are guiding the road to this goal.
