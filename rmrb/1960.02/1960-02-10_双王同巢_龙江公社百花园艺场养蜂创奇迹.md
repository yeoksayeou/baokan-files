    Two Queens in One Hive
    Longjiang Commune's Baihua Horticultural Farm Creates Beekeeping Miracle
    (Our report) The age-old conclusion that "a bee colony cannot have two queens" has been overturned by the daring and capable staff of the Baihua Horticultural Farm in Longjiang Commune, Wugang County, Hunan Province. Through numerous experiments, they have discovered a method for "two queens in one hive," which has greatly promoted the development of beekeeping production.
    The saying "a bee colony cannot have two queens" has always been regarded as an immutable truth, because as soon as two queens are together, they will fight, causing a large number of bee deaths and dispersals. Starting in the winter of 1957, the staff of the Baihua Horticultural Farm in Longjiang Commune boldly wondered whether it was possible to implement "two queens in one hive." They observed and experimented repeatedly, trying various methods to separate the bee colonies within a cage. Initially, the two queens still tried to fight, but because the bee colonies were separated, they couldn't fight; over time, they got used to it and didn't want to fight anymore, and the two queens coexisted peacefully in the same hive.
    On this basis, the staff further conducted experimental research and created a method of "two queens in one colony, with the main and secondary queens being rotated up and down in stages," which can make bees reproduce even more and faster. During the experimental research, the staff, through careful investigation and analysis, also discovered that worker bees have the characteristic of not wanting to live without a queen. They used this characteristic to create a method of controlling the queen bee's movements and eliminating bee colony escape. They once experimented with a bee colony that had been damaged by pests, fitting it with a iron hole nest door. They found that although a large number of worker bees temporarily left the hive and fled far away due to the infestation of pests, only a small number of worker bees remained in the hive to accompany the queen. However, some worker bees accompanying the queen maintained constant contact with the escaped worker bees, and because the queen remained in the hive, the escaped worker bees were forced to return to the original nest.
    The staff of the Baihua Horticultural Farm in Longjiang Commune used these scientific experimental results to promote the continuous and rapid development of beekeeping production. In 1957, there were only more than 50 hives, but now it has developed to more than 400 hives.

    双王同巢
    龙江公社百花园艺场养蜂创奇迹
    本报讯  自古流传的“蜂无二王”的定论，被敢想敢干的湖南武冈县龙江公社百花园艺场的职工用事实推翻了。他们经过多次试验，找出了“双王同巢”的办法，这就大大促进了养蜂生产的发展。
    “蜂无二王”一贯被人们视为天经地义，因为只要两个蜂王在一起，便发生格斗，造成蜜蜂的大量死亡与逃散。从1957年冬季开始，龙江公社百花园艺场的职工大胆设想能不能实行“双王同巢”？他们一次又一次地进行观察、试验，试用各种办法，使一个笼内的蜂群隔开，最初，两个蜂王还是想格斗，由于蜂群被隔开了，斗不起来；久而久之，就习惯了，不想格斗了，两王同巢也就相安无事了。
    在这个基础上，职工们进一步进行试验研究，创造了“双王同群，正副蜂王分期上下调换”的办法，可以使蜜蜂繁殖得更多更快。在试验研究中，职工们经过细致的考察、分析，还发现了工蜂有不愿脱离蜂王而生活的特性。他们利用这个特性，创造了控制母蜂行动、消灭蜂群逃逸的方法。他们曾把受过虫害的蜂群装上铁孔巢门作试验，发现大量工蜂虽因害虫的侵扰一度离箱向远处逃逸，只有少数工蜂在箱内陪伴蜂王。但是，陪伴蜂王的一些工蜂，与外逃工蜂不断保持联系，由于蜂王留在蜂箱内，迫使逃逸的工蜂又返回原巢。
    龙江公社百花园艺场职工利用这些科学试验成果，促使养蜂生产获得了不断的、飞快的发展。1957年只有五十多箱蜂，现在已发展到四百多箱蜂。
