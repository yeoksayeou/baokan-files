Do Not Allow the U.S. Government to Plunder Our Cultural Relics in Taiwan
Mao Dun
The United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique recently reached a so-called "agreement" to transport a large number of our precious cultural relics, which the Chiang Kai-shek clique had looted to Taiwan before liberation, to the United States under the pretext of "exhibition." This shameless robbery by the U.S. government has aroused immense anger among the Chinese people.

The U.S. ruling clique had been constantly looting and stealing our cultural relics for decades before liberation. This time, the large number of cultural relics they are plotting to steal are the precious property of our 650 million people, and the cultural wealth created by our people through thousands of years of labor. We will never allow American imperialism to carry out this robbery. The Chiang Kai-shek clique should be responsible for properly protecting these precious cultural relics, which will return to the motherland along with the territory of Taiwan in the future. They have no right to "lend" them to the United States without authorization. Everyone knows that this so-called "lending" is actually "selling." Any "contract" signed by the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique is invalid. We solemnly warn the American imperialists to immediately stop this shameless act of robbery. The cultural relics in Taiwan must be returned to the motherland with the liberation of Taiwan.

    不许美国政府劫夺我国在台湾的文物
    茅盾
    美国和蒋介石集团最近达成所谓的“协议”，准备把蒋介石集团在解放前劫往台湾的大批我国珍贵文物，假借“展览”为名，运往美国。美国政府这一无耻的强盗行为，引起了我国人民无比的愤怒。
    美国统治集团，远在解放前数十年中，就一直不断地劫夺和偷盗我国的文物，这一次阴谋盗劫的大批文物，都是我国六亿五千万人民的宝贵财产，都是我国人民几千年来劳动创造的文化财富，我们决不允许美帝国主义进行盗劫。蒋介石集团应负责妥善保护这些珍贵文物，将来随同台湾领土一同归回祖国，决没有私自“出借”给美国的权利。谁都知道，这所谓“出借”，实际上就是“盗卖”，美国和蒋介石集团签订的任何“合同”，都是无效的。我们严正的警告美帝国主义者，立即停止这一无耻的盗劫行为。在台湾的文物，一定要随着台湾的解放而归还祖国。
