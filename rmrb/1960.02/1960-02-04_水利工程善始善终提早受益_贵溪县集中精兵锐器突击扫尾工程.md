    Water Conservancy Projects Start Well and End Well, Benefiting Early
    Guixi County Concentrates Elite Forces and Sharp Weapons to Launch a Final Assault to Finish Projects
    (Our dispatch) The water conservancy front in Guixi County, Jiangxi Province, after basically completing its construction tasks, took advantage of the momentum to do a good job in the "finishing" work of the projects, so that each project could be completed early, benefit early, and achieve high efficiency.
    Guixi County originally planned to newly build and expand 373 water conservancy projects this winter and next spring, increasing and expanding the irrigated area by 180,000 mu. After months of intense construction, by mid-January, all projects had been basically completed, with only a few auxiliary projects of large-scale projects and some small-scale projects that needed to be renovated still under construction.
    The primary measure for Guixi County to complete the water conservancy tasks ahead of schedule was to carry out large-scale labor cooperation between communes, teams, and construction sites. Some communes had more labor, but fewer projects needed to be continued; some communes had less labor, but more projects needed to be continued; some construction sites progressed quickly, with both main and auxiliary projects completed, while some construction sites progressed slowly, with some auxiliary projects still needing to be built. Under these circumstances, all communes and brigades widely carried out large-scale cooperation based on the principle of equal value exchange, mutually adjusting labor, greatly accelerating the progress of water conservancy construction, and promoting the early completion of each construction site.
    Organizing elite troops and concentrating the use of advanced construction tools is another measure for Guixi County to launch a final assault on water conservancy. Some projects had more auxiliary projects that had not yet been completed. If they relied solely on the original labor for construction, the completion time would be prolonged. If they relied on carrying out technological innovation and improving work efficiency to accelerate the construction progress, there would not be enough time. Therefore, the communes organized experienced migrant workers from the completed construction sites, concentrated various advanced tools, and launched a sudden attack, enabling these projects to be completed quickly in a short period of time. For example, the auxiliary project of the "May Fourth" Reservoir in Zhiguang Commune had more than 100,000 cubic meters of earthwork, which would need to be delayed until after the Spring Festival to be completed. Later, the commune transferred 250 young people and more than 100 advanced tools from the completed construction site. After only seven days of fighting, the auxiliary projects of this project, such as channels and culverts, were all completed.
    Another measure for Guixi County to end the water conservancy finishing work is to conduct a general water conservancy inspection throughout the county, and immediately organize labor to "make up lessons" where deficiencies are found to ensure the excellent quality of each project. When the inspection team of Luohe Commune inspected the Leixi and Xingyuan Brigades, they found that the soil foundation of the auxiliary dam of a reservoir in each of these two teams was not compacted tightly, and the channel width did not meet the standard. Immediately, more than 100 commune members were organized to "make up lessons" in a sudden attack, re-compacting the soil foundation of the auxiliary dam within five days, and widening the channel according to the original design requirements, so that all projects met the design standards.
    To ensure that the newly built water conservancy projects can play their benefits early and comprehensively, it is also necessary to do a good job in organization and management as early as possible. Before the completion of the water conservancy projects, the communes, brigades, and teams in Guixi County universally started to organize water conservancy management agencies and determined full-time management personnel. Now, all six projects irrigating more than 10,000 mu of farmland in the county have jointly established water conservancy management committees by the benefiting communes, with more than 30 cadres and experienced commune members specially responsible for management, and have formulated project management systems and water use systems.
    Due to the adoption of the above-mentioned effective measures, the finishing work of water conservancy projects in Guixi County has progressed extremely rapidly. To date, 80% of the newly built projects in the county have been fully completed, and 85% of the old small-scale projects have been renovated. Currently, 20,000 migrant workers in the county are continuing to fight on the water conservancy construction sites, striving to end the finishing work of water conservancy projects well.

    水利工程善始善终提早受益
    贵溪县集中精兵锐器突击扫尾工程
    本报讯　江西贵溪县水利战线在基本完成兴修任务后，一鼓作气，乘胜做好工程“扫尾”工作，使座座工程早完工、早受益、效益高。
    贵溪县原计划去冬今春新建扩建三百七十三座水利工程，增加和扩大灌溉面积十八万亩；经过几个月来的紧张施工，至1月中旬止，各个工程都已基本完工，只有少数大型工程的部分附属工程和一些需要整修的小型工程施工还未结束。
    贵溪县提前结束水利任务的首要措施是，开展社与社、队与队、工地与工地之间的劳力大协作。有的公社劳力较多，而需要继续兴修的工程又较少，有的公社劳力较少，需要继续兴修的工程又较多；有的工地进度快，主体和附属工程都已建成，有的工地进度较慢，还有一些附属工程需要兴建。在这种情况下，各公社、大队根据等价交换的原则，广泛开展了大协作，互相调剂劳力，大大加快了水利兴修进度，促使座座工地早日完工。
    组织精兵上阵，集中使用先进的施工工具，是贵溪县突击水利扫尾工作的另一措施。有的工程尚未完工的附属工程较多，如果光靠原有劳力兴修，完工时间就会拖长；如果依靠开展技术革新、提高工效来加快施工进度，时间也来不及。因此，各公社便从已经完工的工地，组织有兴修水利经验的民工，集中各种先进工具，突击施工，使这些工程在短时间内迅速完工。例如，志光公社“五四”水库的附属工程有十多万土方，需要拖到春节后才能完工；后来公社从已经完工的工地调来二百五十名青年、一百多件先进工具只经过七天战斗，这座工程的渠道、涵管等附属工程就全部建成了。
    贵溪县结束水利扫尾的又一措施是，全县普遍开展水利大检查，发现不足的地方立即组织劳力“补课”，保证座座工程的质量优良。罗河公社检查团在雷溪、兴源大队检查时，发现这两个队各有一座水库的副坝土基夯压不紧，渠道宽度不合标准。立即分别组织了一百多名社员突击“补课”，在五天内重新夯压了副坝土基，按原设计要求加宽了渠道，从而使全部工程都符合了设计标准。
    要保证新建水利工程又早又全面地发挥效益，还必须及早做好组织管理工作。贵溪县各公社、大队、小队在水利工程竣工前，就普遍着手组织了水利管理机构，确定了专职管理人员。现在全县六座灌溉万亩农田以上的工程，都已分别由受益的公社联合成立了水利管理委员会，有三十多名干部和有经验的社员专门负责管理，并已制定了工程管理制度和用水制度。
    由于采取了上述有效措施，贵溪县水利工程扫尾工作进展极快。至今全县有80％的新修工程已经全部竣工，有85％的旧有小型工程已经整修完毕。目前全县有二万名民工正在水利工地继续奋战，力求很好地结束水利工程扫尾工作。
