　　The "Housekeepers" of the Masses' Lives
　　Yu Yizhi　Cheng Xiufang
　　No. 2, South Third Street, Chunhua Street, Harbin, is a residential compound of thirty-eight households. In the old society, such compounds were called "big tenement yards," where every family worried about food and clothing every day, and the yards were dirty and noisy. But this kind of life was long buried by the new society. Now, upon entering this compound, the first thing one sees is a sign outside the gate that reads "Sanitation Model Compound." The yard is clean, the windowpanes are brightly polished, and the rooms of each family are neatly arranged. During the day, very few people can be seen in the yard; all thirty-eight adult men and women have jobs. They go to work in the morning and return in the evening, spending the rest of their time studying, resting, and enjoying recreation. So, who looks after their children, and who takes care of cleaning the rooms, and buying firewood, rice, oil, and salt? The service station has become the housekeeper for the thirty-eight households in this compound. This service station has one director and seven service personnel, who contribute their energy to everyone's life without complaint, allowing the workers in this compound to rest adequately, live happily, and devote themselves to socialist production with full energy.

　　Every day, just as the sky begins to brighten and the workers are still sound asleep, the director of the service station, Wang Suqin, and her companions begin their day's work. They quietly light the stove for the water kettle, sweep the yard, wipe the corridors, and prepare breakfast for the workers. When the workers get up to wash their faces, the service personnel have already set the breakfast on the table. Everyone eats breakfast comfortably, and the men and women go off to work in pairs. This seems like an extremely ordinary thing, but it contains such profound significance! Think about it, in the past, all thirty-eight families had to get up early before work to prepare breakfast. Some workers were afraid of being late for work and affecting production, so sometimes they left without eating breakfast. Now, eight service personnel sacrifice some of their morning rest time to bring so much rest time and convenience to the people in the compound!

　　The workers begin a day of labor competition next to the machines, while at the same time, in the workers' homes, the service personnel are also working hard for their lives. Those children who need to go to kindergarten or nursery, their parents are still sound asleep when they go to work! Now, the service personnel have begun to take care of these children. The director of the service station, Wang Suqin, told us about the affairs of Lou Yongxiang and his wife. In the past, because the times for going to work and sending their children to the nursery were different, sometimes the child was left at home, and the two went to work with worries, doing their work with their minds preoccupied with the child, worrying about the child falling off the *kang*. Now, Lou Yongxiang and his wife eat breakfast and leave without any worries. Wang Suqin takes the key left by Lou Yongxiang, opens the door, dresses the family's one-and-a-half-year-old child, wraps the child in a quilt, and sends the child to the nursery, and then cleans their room. When the workers in the workshop have completed the first two hours of production, the service personnel here have already finished the household chores that each family needs to take care of in the morning.

　　Hardworking service personnel are better than anyone managing their own housework. As soon as the morning chores are finished, they go their separate ways to buy things for the workers, repair furniture, utensils, sew or launder clothes. For these tedious household chores, as long as the workers write down what each family needs to do on the service message board that day, they will see that the service personnel have completely completed everything as required when they return from work. The clothes to be washed have been washed clean and folded on the bed, the things bought have been placed in their proper places, the floors and windows are spotless, and the thermos bottles are filled with boiling hot water. But the service personnel do more than just the work that the workers ask them to do; they treat every household and every household chore as their own, and they care for every resident as if they were their own parents, siblings. There is an old man in the compound named Du Zhaojing, who has two sons. The elder son works at the Songjiang Electric Machinery Factory and lives in the factory dormitory, so he does not come home often. In the past, the household chores were taken care of by this old man. The women in the same compound were very enthusiastic about Du's household chores and were willing to help. But they were all busy with work during the day, and Du Zhaojing didn't want to bother them too much. If his clothes were torn, he would mend them himself with large and small stitches. After the service station was established, the service personnel took over all his household chores like his own daughters. However, Du Zhaojing still had a special difficulty that could not be solved. He was tall and always had trouble buying shoes that fit in the street. Wang Suqin, upon hearing that Old Man Du had this difficulty, mobilized the service personnel to spin hemp thread in their spare time, make shoe soles, and make a pair of very comfortable shoes for Du Zhaojing and sent them to him. Du Zhaojing never expected that the service personnel, who had so much work to do, would still think about the problem of his shoes, and he was so moved that he didn't know what to say. He quickly took out the local products he had brought from his hometown and insisted that the service personnel accept them. One night, all the service personnel, who had been working hard all day, were resting, when Sun Shuqin, a pregnant woman in the compound, suddenly went into labor. Her husband, Chen Baoquan, rushed to the factory to borrow a car to take the pregnant woman to the hospital. When the service personnel heard about it, they quickly got up and came to take care of Sun Shuying. When Chen Baoquan found the car, it was already one o'clock in the middle of the night. His wife had already been safely taken to the hospital under the care of the service personnel.

　　In this compound, the service personnel are loved and respected by everyone. Because they not only create a comfortable living environment for the workers, but also their truly selfless labor embodies the communist spirit. They undertake dozens of household chores for dozens of households in the compound, and they take care of the lives of these people day and night, but they only charge a very small fee from the residents each month. The highly moral housekeepers bring the best influence to their family members. In this large family of thirty-eight households, everyone understands that serving the public is a glorious job.

　　Now, this service station has honorably become an advanced collective in the collective welfare undertaking of Harbin City. The director of the service station, Wang Suqin, and the service personnel, Tian Yulan, are advanced workers in the financial and trade system of Heilongjiang Province. Wang Suqin has also been elected as a member of the National Preparatory Committee for the Celebration of the "March 8th" International Women's Day. These housekeepers of socialist life will continue to move forward under the encouragement of collective honor.

    群众生活的“管家人”
    于义治　程秀芳
    哈尔滨纯化街南三道街二号，是一个三十八户人家的居民大院。大院在旧社会叫大杂院，每一家人每一天都要为衣食发愁，院子里肮脏、嘈杂。可是这种生活早被新社会埋葬了。现在，一进这个大院，首先能看到大门外挂着“卫生模范大院”的牌子，院子里干干净净，门窗的玻璃都擦的明亮，每一家的屋子里也布置的整整齐齐。白天在院子里很少能看见几个人，三十八户男女成年人都有工作。他们早晨上班，晚间回来，余下的时间是学习、休息、娱乐。那么他们的孩子谁看，打扫房间卫生、购买柴米油盐又由谁来办理呢？服务站已成了这个大院三十八户家务事的管家人。这个服务站有一个站长、七个服务员，她们不辞辛苦地为大家的生活贡献出自己的精力，使这个大院的职工们休息的充足、生活的愉快，精力饱满地投身于社会主义生产劳动。
    每天天刚亮，职工们都还在酣睡的时候，服务站站长王素琴和她的同伴们，就开始一天的劳动了。她们轻轻地把烧水壶的炉子点着，扫院子，擦走廊，为职工准备早饭。当职工们起床洗脸的时候，服务员已经把早点摆到餐桌上。大家舒服地吃完早饭，男女一对对的上班去了。看起来这是极其平凡的事情，但是这里面包含着多么深刻的意义啊！想想看吧，以前三十八家人都要在上班前赶早起来准备早饭，有的工人怕上班晚了，影响生产，有时候不吃早饭就走了。现在，八个服务员牺牲一些自己早上的休息时间，给大院里的人带来多少休息的时间和多大的方便！
    职工们在机器旁边开始了一天的劳动竞赛，同时在职工们的家里，服务员们也正为他们的生活紧张地劳动。那些要上幼儿园或托儿所的孩子们，当他们的爸爸妈妈上班去的时候，他们还睡的正香呢！现在，服务员们又开始照顾这些小孩子了。服务站长王素琴向我们讲述了楼永祥夫妇的事情，过去因上班和送孩子上托儿所的时间不一样，有时候孩子就放在家里，两人挂着心事去上班，手里干着活，心里惦念着孩子别滚下炕来。如今楼永祥和爱人吃完早饭，无牵无挂地走了。王素琴拿着楼永祥留下的钥匙，打开房门，给这家一周岁半的孩子穿好衣服，包好了被送到托儿所去，然后再给他们清扫房间。当职工们在车间里完成了头两个小时生产的时候，这里的服务员也已经把每家早晨要办的家务事忙完了。
    辛勤的服务员比得上任何一个管理自己家务的人。早晨的事情刚忙完，她们又分头去为职工们买东西、修理家具、器皿、缝补或是浆洗衣裳。像这些繁琐的家务事只要职工在服务留言簿上写下各家当天要办的事，下班回来就会看到服务员已经按照要求完全办妥了。要洗的衣服已经洗干净叠好放在床上，买来的东西已经摆在应放的地方，地板、门窗擦洗的一尘不染，暖瓶里灌满滚热的开水。但是服务员们还不只是做职工要求代办的工作，她们把每一户每一件家务事，都当做自己的事那样主动去照料，对待每一个居民都像对待自己的父母姊妹那样关心。大院里有一个叫杜兆经的老人，家里有两个儿子。大儿子在松江电机厂工作，住在工厂宿舍里不常回家。过去的家务事就靠这个老人来管。同院的妇女对杜老人的家务事都很热心，愿意帮忙。可是她们白天又都上班时间挺紧，杜兆经不愿多麻烦她们，衣服破了，自己动手大一针小一针地补上。服务站成立后，服务员们像亲女儿那样，把他的家务事全部包下来。可是杜兆经还有一件特殊的困难解决不了。他的身材高大，老是在街上不易买到合脚的鞋子。哪知道王素琴一听说杜老人还有这个困难，就发动服务员抽空搓麻线，打“袼褙”，给杜兆经做了一双非常合脚的鞋送去。杜兆经没想到工作这样多的服务员还想到他穿鞋的问题，感动的不知说些什么好，连忙拿出从家乡带来的土产，硬要服务员收下。有一次深夜，劳碌了一天的服务员都休息了，大院里的孕妇孙淑琴突然要生产，她丈夫陈宝泉急忙跑到工厂里借车，准备送产妇进医院。服务员一听说，连忙起床赶来照顾孙淑英。当陈宝泉找来车子的时候，已经是后半夜一点钟了。他的爱人早在服务员的照顾下妥善地送到医院里去了。
    在这个大院里，服务员受到人人爱戴、个个尊敬。因为她们不仅是给职工们创造了舒适的生活环境，而且她们那种真正忘我的劳动，发扬了共产主义的风格。她们承担了大院里几十户人家几十种家务劳动，并且是日夜照料这些人的生活，每个月却只从居民那里收很少很少的费用。思想崇高的管家人，给自己的家庭成员带来最好的影响。在这个三十八户组成的大家庭里，人人都懂得为众人服务是光荣的工作。
    现在，这个服务站已光荣地成为哈尔滨市集体福利事业的先进集体。服务站站长王素琴，服务员田玉兰是黑龙江省财贸系统的先进工作者，王素琴还被推选为全国庆祝“三八”国际妇女节筹备委员会的委员。这些社会主义生活的管家人，在集体荣誉的鼓舞下，将继续前进。
