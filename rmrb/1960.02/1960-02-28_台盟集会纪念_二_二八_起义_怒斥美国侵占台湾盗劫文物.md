Xinhua News Agency, February 27th: The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League Headquarters and the Beijing Municipal Branch jointly held a meeting today to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the Taiwan people's "February 28th" Uprising. Attendees condemned the United States for forcibly occupying Taiwan and attempting to plunder China's cultural relics in Taiwan. They vehemently shouted slogans such as "US troops must get out of Taiwan" and "US robbers are not allowed to plunder China's cultural relics."

The meeting today was presided over by Xu Mengshan, Secretary-General of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League Headquarters. Xu Mengshan pointed out at the meeting that the recent US government's conspiracy to plunder China's cultural relics in Taiwan once again exposes that the US ruling clique is not only a military, political, and economic aggressor, but also a robber frantically engaged in cultural aggression. Xu Mengshan said that the Taiwan compatriots in the capital are extremely indignant at the new crimes of the United States. We fully support the serious warning and statement issued by the Ministry of Culture to the US government. We must drive the American aggressors out of Taiwan, and we must recover the cultural relics that the American robbers are preparing to plunder from Taiwan; and warn the Chiang Kai-shek clique that it must immediately stop the shameful act of selling out the cultural heritage of the motherland.

Xu Mengshan said that the peace tricks currently being played by US imperialism around the world are also fully exposed by the fact that it is stepping up the expansion of military bases in Taiwan and intensifying its political, economic, and cultural aggression against Taiwan. The Taiwan compatriots who are living in darkness under the iron heel of US imperialism are adopting various methods to fight against the American occupiers. This is part of the 650 million Chinese people's struggle against American aggressors, so it is by no means isolated. With the continued great leap forward in the socialist construction of the motherland and the increasing strength of the socialist camp, the strong desire of Taiwan compatriots to return to the embrace of the motherland will surely be realized.

Tian Fuda (Gaoshan ethnic group), representative of the National People's Congress, Chen Wenbin and Su Ziheng, members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Chen Bingji, Director of the Beijing Municipal Branch of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, Chen Musen, an advanced worker in Beijing and a doctor from Taiwan at Jishuitan Hospital, and others, all took the floor at the meeting to denounce the various crimes of the United States in invading Taiwan.

    台盟集会纪念“二·二八”起义
    怒斥美国侵占台湾盗劫文物
    据新华社27日讯　台湾民主自治同盟总部和北京市支部今天联合举行纪念台湾人民“二·二八”起义十三周年的集会，到会的人们纷纷谴责美国武力霸占台湾和企图劫夺我国在台湾文物的罪行，他们情绪激昂地一致高呼“美国军队必须滚出台湾”、“不准美国强盗劫夺我国文物”等口号。
    今天的集会由台湾民主自治同盟总部秘书长徐萌山主持。徐萌山在会上指出，最近美国政府阴谋劫夺我国在台湾的文物，又一次暴露了美国统治集团不仅是军事上、政治上、经济上的侵略者，而且是疯狂地进行文化侵略的强盗。徐萌山说，在首都的台湾同胞对美国的新罪行都极为愤慨。我们完全拥护文化部对美国政府提出的严重警告和声明。我们一定要把美国侵略者从台湾赶出去，一定要把美国强盗准备从台湾劫走的文物追回来；并且警告蒋介石集团，必须立即停止出卖祖国文化遗产的可耻勾当。
    徐萌山说，美帝国主义目前在全世界范围内玩弄的和平花招，在它正在台湾加紧扩建军事基地和加紧对台湾进行政治、经济和文化侵略的事实中，也充分暴露出来。在美帝国主义铁蹄践踏下过着暗无天日生活的台湾乡亲们，正在采用各种方式进行着反对美国占领者的斗争。这是六亿五千万中国人民反对美国侵略者斗争的一部分，因此，绝不是孤立的。随着祖国社会主义建设继续大跃进和社会主义阵营日益强大，台湾同胞要求台湾回到祖国怀抱的强烈愿望，一定能够实现。
    全国人民代表大会代表田富达（高山族）、全国政协委员陈文彬和苏子蘅、台盟北京市支部主任委员陈炳基、北京市的先进工作者、积水潭医院台湾籍医生陈木森等，纷纷在会上控诉美国侵略台湾的各种罪行。
