Anshan, February 2nd (Reporter from this newspaper) - The design personnel of the Anshan Coking and Refractory Material Design Institute, under the leadership of the Party Committee of the Institute, have brought their collective wisdom into play and created a set of rapid and high-quality design experiences using matching methods.

Since the design institute launched a technical performance competition among its design personnel in September last year, a new situation has emerged in design work. In the preliminary design of coking plants, the efficiency of design work has increased five to six times; in the preliminary design of refractory material plants, the efficiency of design work has increased eight to ten times; the efficiency of construction design has increased about three times, greatly accelerating the design speed. Now the design speed of this design institute has jumped from the original calculation by month to calculation by day. In early January, the design institute used their created experience of designing with matching methods and completed the preliminary design of two medium-sized coking plants in four days, which was one month ahead of the fastest speed in the past, and the design quality fully met the standards.

The experience of this design institute shows that design work can only continuously leap forward under the leadership of the Party, constantly criticizing various conservative ideas, and adhering to vigorous mass movements. At the beginning of the movement, a few people emphasized that design work is different from steelmaking and ironmaking, that it is mental labor, and that there is no way to perform it for others to learn; that design personnel only have a ruler and a pen, and that designing is "manual labor" drawn stroke by stroke, and that there is no way to multiply the efficiency of work; a few cadres were also afraid that using the method of mass movement to do design would disrupt the original "orderly" work order. From the beginning, the Party Committee of this design institute grasped the political and ideological work, organized design personnel to visit and discuss through each successful technical performance; as a result, the mass movement of the technical performance competition went from one climax to another. After a surge of high-efficiency drawing tools, calculation tools, and industrial design methods appeared, the Party Committee of the design institute seized the budding of industrial design reform and guided the technical performance competition towards industrial design reform. It called on everyone to fully explore the rich experience accumulated over the past few years while creating new experiences, and to organize the scattered experiences into sets. Subsequently, the entire institute launched a surge of "rummaging through boxes and cabinets" and "everyone contributing their best tricks" for experience matching. As of early January, 1,132 sets of various experiences have been matched, including 226 sets in preliminary design and 599 sets in construction design. From collecting design data to drawing, almost every link in the design has been matched with a set of experiences; on this basis, a set of experiences in using matching methods to do design was created. Now this design institute has widely adopted the method of designing with matching sets, replacing the old method of drawing stroke by stroke and redesigning drawings every year. Whether it is designing a construction drawing or designing a factory, as long as you extract the suitable parts from the complete set of "materials" of construction design and preliminary design that have been sorted out, make minor modifications, and match them into sets.

The new design method not only reduces a lot of repetitive labor, the highest work efficiency has increased more than 60 times, but also because the "materials" used have been finalized, it also guarantees and improves the design quality. With the industrial reform of design methods, the masses have also created methods to accelerate the design progress such as fighting "annihilation battles" and organizing "shock brigades". As soon as these new things emerged, the Party Committee of the design institute enthusiastically supported them. The further improvement of these experiences was finally organized into a complete set of working methods to promote the great leap forward in design work. The characteristics of this method are: according to the urgency and importance of the design tasks, each section organizes its professional groups, and the leaders of the institute organize each section to closely combine and act in unison, one project after another, one link after another, and fight "annihilation battles" by project and link. This changes the past situation in the organization of design work, where multiple projects were spread out in all directions, all links of the design were carried out simultaneously, the battle lines were stretched, the forces were dispersed, and they were interfering with each other.

The experience of the Anshan Coking and Refractory Material Design Institute has aroused the attention of relevant leaders. In early January, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry held an on-site meeting in Anshan to promote their experience.

    鞍山焦化耐火材料设计院群策群力
    用配套方法设计又快又好
    焦化厂初步设计效率提高五至六倍；耐火材料厂初步设计效率提高八到十倍；施工设计效率都提高三倍左右
    本报鞍山2日电　鞍山焦化耐火材料设计院的设计人员，在院党委领导下，发挥集体智慧，创造了一套用配套方法做设计的快速优质设计经验。
    这个设计院自从去年9月发动设计人员开展技术表演赛以来，在设计工作上出现了一个崭新的局面。在焦化工厂初步设计方面，提高设计工作效率五倍到六倍；在耐火材料工厂初步设计方面，提高设计工作效率八倍到十倍；施工设计的工作效率，都提高了三倍左右，大大加快了设计速度。现在这个设计院的设计速度，已经从原来的按月计算，一跃而为按天计算了。这个设计院在1月上旬，运用他们创造的用配套方法做设计的经验，四天就做完了两个中型焦化工厂的初步设计，比过去最快的速度还提前一个月，设计质量完全符合标准。
    这个设计院的经验表明，设计工作只有在党的领导下，不断地批判各种各样保守思想，坚持大搞群众运动才能不断地跃进。运动刚开始，有少数人强调设计工作和炼钢炼铁不同，是脑力劳动者，没有办法表演出来给别人学习；设计人员只有一把尺一支笔，做设计是一笔一笔画的“手工劳动”，工作效率没有办法成倍的提高；少数干部也怕用搞群众运动的办法做设计，会打乱原来“有条不紊”的工作秩序。这个设计院的党委，一开始就抓住了政治思想工作，通过每一项成功的技术表演，组织设计人员参观座谈；结果就使技术表演赛的群众运动从一个高潮走向另一个高潮。在出现了一批高工效的描图工具、计算工具和改业设计方法的热潮后，设计院的党委，便抓住设计方法改业的萌芽，把技术表演赛引向了改业设计。号召大家在创造新经验的同时，要充分挖掘几年来积累的丰富经验，把零星的经验整理成套。接着，全院便掀起了一个“翻箱倒柜”，“人人献绝着”的经验配套热潮。到1月上旬止，已经配出各种经验一千一百三十二套，其中初步设计方面二百二十六套，施工设计方面五百九十九套，从收集设计资料到描图，几乎在设计的各个环节上，都搭配出成套的经验；在这个基础上，创造了一套用配套办法做设计的经验。现在这个设计院已经广泛采用配套办法做设计，代替了过去一笔一笔画、每年图纸都要重新设计的笨办法。不论是设计一张施工图，还是设计一个工厂，只要从已经整理好的施工设计、初步设计的成套“资料”里，吸取适合的部分，少加修改配成套就行了。
    新的设计方法，不仅减少了许多重复劳动，工作效率最高的提高了六十多倍，而且因为所用的“资料”已经定型，也保证和提高了设计质量。随着设计方法的改业，群众又创造了打“歼灭战”，组织“突击队”等加快设计进度的办法。这些新事物一露头，设计院党委就热情地扶植它们。这些经验的进一步完善，最后就整理成了一套促进设计工作大跃进的整套工作方法。这个方法的特点是：根据设计任务的轻重缓急，由各科组织所属专业组，由院领导组织各科紧密结合，一致行动，一项工程一项工程，一个环节一个环节，分项目分环节打“歼灭战”。这就改变了过去在设计工作的组织上，多项工程全面铺开，设计的各环节同时进行，拉长战线、分散兵力、互相牵扯的状况。
    鞍山焦化耐火材料设计院的经验，引起了有关领导方面的重视。冶金工业部1月上旬在鞍山召开了现场会，推广了他们的经验。
