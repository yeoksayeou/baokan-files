Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 10th: Some Western newspapers and news agencies have revealed that U.S. President Eisenhower is very embarrassed and annoyed by the recent arguments in the U.S. Congress and press about the U.S. lagging far behind in missiles and outer space exploration.

Not long after this argument began in Congress, Eisenhower tried his best to cover up the truth of America's paper tiger status. According to "Washington Post" columnist Pearson on February 2nd, Eisenhower decided to launch a campaign "to convince the American people and the world that we (the United States) are catching up with Moscow in missiles." Pearson also revealed that the U.S. "National Security Council once warned in a secret report that Russia's remarkable achievements in rockets and space are making the world believe that the United States has become a second-rate country. Therefore, the Security Council recommended launching a propaganda campaign to convince the world that the opposite is true."

Pearson said that Eisenhower had ordered all cabinet members to "emphasize the positive aspects of our own (American) missile development when talking about military issues, and to emphasize that when considering all weapons, we are actually stronger (than the Soviet Union)."

Pearson revealed that Snyder, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense in charge of news affairs, had asked Department of Defense officials to counterattack news reporters who criticized the government's military policies. He suggested that questions raised by reporters should "be given vague answers, and reporters should be reminded that the president is the person who understands military issues best."

Snyder also suggested that "if reporters ask unfriendly questions, officials should accuse these reporters of slander, libel, and unpatriotic activities."

According to Pearson, Eisenhower was "very angry" with the director of the U.S. Information Agency, George Allen, "because Allen publicly claimed that the backwardness of the United States in space research had damaged the prestige of the United States abroad," "His words were completely contrary to what the president had been telling the public."

But despite Eisenhower's attempts to cover up, as the debate in the U.S. Congress intensified, the truth was further exposed. Therefore, according to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Washington, Eisenhower is "increasingly annoyed by the public debate in Congress on the issue of U.S. defense (referring to military affairs)."

Signs indicate that Eisenhower is trying to suppress the debate in Congress, or at least prevent it from being public, under the pretext of "keeping military secrets."

Yesterday, he summoned Republican leaders of both the Senate and the House of Representatives to the White House to discuss these recent so-called "leaks of military intelligence." Senate Republican leader Dirksen told reporters after the meeting that Eisenhower was "uneasy" and "agitated" about the situation.

Under such circumstances, the U.S. Senate's public inquiry on military issues yesterday turned into a closed-door meeting midway.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th, Cape Canaveral (U.S.): The so-called "Atlas" intercontinental missile, which U.S. President Eisenhower had praised not long ago, failed again in a test on the evening of the 9th, just a few hours before Eisenhower was scheduled to visit. This time, the missile did not even leave the launch pad.

After the White House announced that Eisenhower would inspect the Cape Canaveral missile test base, the base authorities wanted to show off their achievements to him and actively prepared for this "Atlas" missile launch. According to a United Press International report on the 9th: "They had hoped to let Eisenhower see the successful results of the space thruster when he flew to Cape Canaveral tomorrow (the 10th) morning."

However, this missile just wouldn't cooperate. Shortly after the missile thruster was started on the evening of the 9th, a malfunction occurred, and the missile failed to leave the launch pad.

On the morning of the 10th, Eisenhower conducted a three-hour so-called "interested" inspection of Cape Canaveral.

    总统想遮丑　导弹偏出丑
    艾森豪威尔欲盖弥彰
    据新华社10日讯　华盛顿消息：一些西方报纸和通讯社透露，美国总统艾森豪威尔对美国国会和报刊最近关于美国在导弹和外层空间探索方面大大落后的争吵感到十分狼狈和恼火。
    在国会这一场争吵开始不久的时候，艾森豪威尔就竭力设法掩盖美国的纸老虎真相。据“华盛顿邮报”专栏作家皮尔逊2月2日报道，艾森豪威尔决定发动一个运动，“以使美国人民和全世界相信，我们（美国）在导弹方面正在赶上莫斯科”。皮尔逊还透露，美国“国家安全委员会在一次秘密报告中曾经警告过，俄国在火箭和空间方面的引人注目的成就正在使得全世界相信美国已成为二等国家。因之安全委员会建议发动一个宣传运动，以使全世界相信实际情况正好相反”。
    皮尔逊说，艾森豪威尔曾经命令所有的阁员在谈论军事问题时“都强调我们自己（美国）在导弹发展方面的肯定的一面，并且着重指出，当考虑到全部武器时，我们实际上是（比苏联）更强大的”。
    皮尔逊透露，美国负责新闻事务的助理国防部长斯奈德曾要求国防部的官员们对那些批评政府军事政策的新闻记者进行还击。他提议，对记者提出的问题“给予含糊的回答，并且提醒记者，总统是最清楚地了解军事问题的人”。
    斯奈德还建议，“如果记者提出不友好的问题，官员们应该控告这些记者进行诽谤、中伤和不爱国的活动”。
    据皮尔逊说，艾森豪威尔曾经对新闻署署长乔治·艾伦“大生气”，“因为艾伦曾公开地声称美国在空间研究方面的落后状况已损害了美国在国外的威信”，“他说的话同总统一直告诉公众的话完全相反”。
    但是尽管艾森豪威尔设法掩盖，随着美国国会中的争吵日益激烈，真相是更加暴露了。因此，据法新社发自华盛顿的一条消息说，艾森豪威尔“对于国会正在进行的关于美国防御（指军事）问题的公开辩论愈来愈感到恼火”。
    迹象表明，艾森豪威尔正在设法用“保守军事秘密”的借口，来压制国会中的争吵或至少使之不公开。
    他昨天召集了参众两院的共和党领袖到白宫去讨论最近这些所谓“泄露军事情报”的问题。参议院共和党领袖德克逊会后对记者说，艾森豪威尔对这种情况感到“不安”和“激动”。
    在这样的情况下，美国参议院昨天举行的关于军事问题的公开质询中途转入了秘密会议。
    新华社11日讯　卡纳维拉尔角（美国）消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔前不久曾经大加赞赏的所谓“阿特拉斯”洲际导弹，9日晚间在艾森豪威尔预定前往视察的前几小时的试验中，又一次失败了。这枚导弹这一次甚至未能离开发射台。
    在白宫宣布艾森豪威尔将视察卡纳维拉尔角导弹试验基地以后，基地当局就想向他表一表功，积极准备这次“阿特拉斯”导弹发射。据合众国际社9日报道：“他们本来指望艾森豪威尔明天（10日）上午飞抵卡纳维拉尔角时让他看看空间推进器成功的结果”。
    但是，这个导弹偏偏不争气。就在9日晚间导弹推进器刚刚开动不久，就出现了故障，导弹连发射台都未能离开。
    10日上午，艾森豪威尔到卡纳维拉尔角进行了三小时所谓“有兴趣的”视察。
