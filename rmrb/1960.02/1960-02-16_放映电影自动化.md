Xinhua News Agency, Harbin - Projectionists at the Northeast Cinema in Harbin recently created an automated movie projection system to replace manual operation. Once the projectionist pre-arranges the showings and sets the time after arriving for work each day, the automated system can complete all the scheduled projection tasks for the day.

The automated movie projection system uses a master timer controller to automatically operate the entire projection process, which previously required manual operation of over twenty steps, including ringing the bell, dimming the house lights, starting the generator, opening the screen curtains, automatic reel changes, starting the sound system, and projecting the film, all the way to stopping the machine and resetting after a film is finished. This ensures that the machine's operation and pauses are synchronized, the timing is accurate, and the sound and light are coordinated. This not only reduces the projectionist's workload, reducing the number of projectionists per shift from two to one, but also fundamentally eliminates phenomena that were difficult to overcome with manual operation in the past, such as showing film leaders, trailers, or black and white flashes, thereby improving the projection quality.

    放映电影自动化
    据新华社哈尔滨电　哈尔滨市东北电影院的放映员，最近创制了电影放映自动线，代替人工操作放映电影。只要放映员在每天上班后，预先排定场次，对准时间，自动线就可完成全日预定的放映任务。
    电影放映自动线把过去由人工操作的打铃、闭熄场内灯光、开动发电机、打开银幕帘、自动换片、开录音机、出光放映，一直到一部影片映完后的停机、还原等二十多道整个放映过程的工序，通过定时放映总机控制器全部用机器自动操作，使机器运转和停歇步调一致，时间准确，声光协调。不但减轻了放映员的劳动强度，每班的放映员由原来的两名改为一名；而且从根本上消除了过去手工操作时难以克服的露片头、露尾、露黑白光等现象，提高了放映质量。
