    Strive for the Continued Great Leap Forward of the Film Industry
    Xia Yan
    In the past ten years, under the correct leadership of the Party, China's film industry has made great progress and development, especially since the Great Leap Forward, this progress and development has become even more significant. The facts of the past two years prove that the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results has played a great role in the film industry and achieved brilliant achievements. I will only cite a few facts to illustrate this point.
    From 1949 to 1957 before the Great Leap Forward, China had only ten film studios in total (including six feature film studios) and nineteen sound stages. Now, the country has thirty-three film studios (including eleven feature film studios) and twenty-seven sound stages for feature films. In terms of screening units, in 1949, there were only six hundred cinemas in the country, and no mobile projection teams. By the end of 1957, screening units had developed to nine thousand nine hundred and sixty-five, and by the end of 1959, according to preliminary statistics, they had reached about fourteen thousand five hundred. Due to the development of the screening network, the public's opportunities to watch movies have greatly increased. In 1957, the national film audience was 1.75 billion, which jumped to 4.05 billion in 1959. That is to say, the two years since the Great Leap Forward have reached the figures that could only be achieved in the past eight years. An annual audience of 4 billion is already a considerable number, especially when compared with the sharp decline in film audiences in Western capitalist countries, our growth is very prominent (for example, in the United Kingdom, the annual film audience was 1.65 billion in 1948, which plummeted to 750 million in 1958, and last year, it dropped again to about 600 million). Of course, in terms of population ratio, the number of 4 billion is still far from meeting the needs of the people.
    Secondly, from the perspective of film production, since the Great Leap Forward, we have indeed achieved remarkable results in all four aspects of more, faster, better, and more economical. More (I will only use feature films as an example), from 1949 to 1957, in eight years, we produced a total of 171 art films, but in the two years since the Great Leap Forward, we produced about 180 art films. This also means that the two years of the Great Leap Forward equaled or even exceeded the past eight years. Faster, in the past, the actual production time for a feature film was at least four or five months, and often as long as a year or more. Since the Great Leap Forward, the production speed has greatly accelerated. Taking the eighteen art films dedicated to the National Day last year as an example, most of them were produced in four to five months, and some only took three months. More Economical, due to increased production and shortened production time, the production cost has also been greatly reduced. In 1953, the average cost of a black and white film was 200,000 yuan, and the average cost of a color film was 610,000 yuan. In 1957, the average cost of a black and white film was 190,000 yuan, and the average cost of a color film was 350,000 yuan. By 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward, the cost of a black and white film was reduced to 110,000 yuan, and the cost of a color film was reduced to 250,000 yuan. As for documentary art films, more than forty were filmed in 1958, with an average cost of only 57,000 yuan per film. As for the most important aspect of "better," the thirty-six films of various styles dedicated to the National Day last year have made significant progress compared to the past, whether in terms of ideology, art, or technology. Of course, from a strict point of view, even these better tribute films still have shortcomings of varying degrees.
    As everyone knows, before liberation, all of China's film equipment and facilities were completely dependent on foreign imports. Now, except for the film base of the film, which will not be produced by ourselves until 1961, we can not only basically manufacture the rest of the equipment ourselves, but also have a small amount of exports, and some of these varieties have caught up with international standards. In the cutting-edge science of film technology, such as panoramic cinema and stereoscopic cinema, we have already successfully trial-produced them.
    We must fully and sufficiently estimate and affirm our achievements, but we also face our shortcomings squarely. Because film is the most mass-based art and one of the Party's sharpest propaganda and education weapons, political and ideological work and creative thinking must be placed in the primary position in the film industry, the Party's leadership over the film industry must be strengthened, the Mao Zedong's literary and artistic line must be unswervingly implemented, and we must closely follow the General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.
    Because the world outlook of some Party members and cadres in the film industry has not been completely changed, and they have not truly transformed from one class to another, they cannot resolutely implement the Party's class policy and class line in their daily work or creative thinking, and they cannot well implement Chairman Mao's policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers with literature and art.
    For ten years, under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee, from the criticism of the reactionary film "The Life of Wu Xun" in 1951, through the rectification of literature and art, the criticism of "A Dream of Red Mansions Studies," the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, especially the rectification and anti-Rightist struggle in 1957, to the anti-Rightist opportunism struggle in the second half of last year, the film industry has been almost constantly engaged in the struggle between the two lines in politics and literary ideology. The situation of this struggle is high for a while, low for a while, eased for a period of time, and then becomes very acute for a period of time. For example, in 1955, after the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group (which was a fierce anti-revisionist struggle in literary ideology), followed by the upsurge of agricultural cooperation and the upsurge of the joint state-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce, the film work also showed a thriving scene, and the film industry made great progress. However, in the following year, after the Hungarian incident, the first to launch an attack on the Party's literary and artistic policy was Zhong Dianfei, a right-wing element within the Party in the film industry, with his "The Gongs and Drums of Film." The rampant attack of the right-wing elements outside the Party on the Party was in the spring of 1957, while Zhong Dianfei's attack was as early as the winter of 1956. In 1957, some poisonous weeds and films with erroneous ideas appeared in our films, such as "The Unfinished Comedy," "Who Is the Abandoned Person," and "The Footsteps of Youth," etc. In fact, most of these film scripts were written at the same time as "The Gongs and Drums of Film," and most of them were filmed in the fourth quarter of 1956 and the first half of 1957. In 1957, we carried out a fierce anti-Rightist struggle, and through the methods of great airing of views, great blooming, and great debate, we repelled the right-wing attack, improved the ideological level and political consciousness of film workers, strengthened unity, and recognized the road, which laid the foundation for the Great Leap Forward of the film industry in 1958. After the anti-Rightist struggle, an unprecedented atmosphere of the Great Leap Forward appeared in the film industry. Through the Double-Anti Campaign, people showed their hearts to the Party, followed by a large number of film workers going to the countryside and factories to participate in labor training. On the one hand, they enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party Central Committee and produced more than 30 excellent films dedicated to the 10th anniversary of the National Day; at the same time, they tried to use the form of documentary art films to film a large number of films that quickly reflected the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture.
    The Great Leap Forward of the film industry in 1958 proved an irrefutable truth with facts: that is, after fierce ideological struggle, after the struggle against bourgeois literary and artistic thought, our film industry can move forward. This also proves that any undertaking can only develop forward with high quality, high output, and high speed if it listens to the Party, acts according to Chairman Mao's teachings, gives prominence to politics, and carries out mass movements in a big way. Otherwise, our undertaking will suffer failure or become stagnant and lifeless.
    Comrade Zhou Yang said in "A Great Debate on the Literary and Art Front" that the anti-Rightist struggle "dealt a fatal blow to bourgeois reactionary ideas, liberated the productive forces of the literary and art circles and their reserves, removed the shackles imposed on them by the old society, eliminated the threat of reactionary atmosphere, and opened up a broad path for the development of proletarian literature and art." These words have left a deep impression on us and have been very enlightening, but he went on to point out: "This work of opening up the road must be done in the future, and the clearing of old bases cannot be completed in one year." Now it seems that the significance of these words is very profound and full of revolutionary foresight. Bourgeois intellectuals who are completely immersed in bourgeois ideology can never complete their ideological transformation in one battle. In the film industry, the historical task of "clearing old bases" has not yet been completed, and the influence of bourgeois ideology, especially revisionist ideology, remaining in people's minds is still quite serious.
    Because the world view of intellectuals and writers has not been completely resolved, modern revisionism can easily find a market among literary and art workers. This is also the case in the film industry. The reason for this, in addition to the most fundamental reason that many film workers have not yet established a true proletarian world view, there are other reasons as well. The first is that revisionism does not appear in the naked form of opposing communism, but cleverly puts on a Marxist coat, so it has a great deceptive effect; the second is that there are some writers who are revisionists in the revolutionary literary and art circles. The first problem is the problem of world view and the level of Marxism-Leninism, which can also be said to be the problem of class sensitivity and discernment that can only be possessed after truly establishing a proletarian world view from revolutionary practice. There are many monsters in Journey to the West, and their phenomena and essence are not easy to see clearly. To see their essence, one must have a pair of wise eyes. Where does the proletarian wise eye come from? First of all, it is necessary to thoroughly transform oneself, transform from one class to another, and become a revolutionary fighter wholeheartedly loyal to the proletariat. At the same time, it is necessary to constantly and painstakingly study Chairman Mao's works, take Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to participate in actual struggles, and train oneself in mass struggles to improve one's ability to discern. The second question is whether we can emancipate our minds and break superstitions, and whether Chinese literary and art workers cultivated by Mao Zedong Thought can stand up straight and fight against all non-proletarian ideas. Because we have lived in semi-feudal and semi-colonial China, and because we have been educated by the Western bourgeoisie since childhood, the temperament of Jia Gui in the Famen Temple still exists in us to a considerable extent. We still lack the spirit and style that a proletarian revolutionary should have. This is also the result of insufficient attention to Mao Zedong's literary and art thought, and even underestimating its significance. Comrade Mao Zedong creatively developed Marxist-Leninist literary and art theory and further solved the problems that Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin had not been able to solve or did not have time to solve at that time. Therefore, as long as we can truly grasp Chairman Mao's thought and can use this weapon to measure things and works at any time, then we can distinguish what is true Marxism and what is false Marxism, and we can also hold our heads high and will not be frightened.
    As literary and art workers of New China, some people still have a national inferiority complex of worshiping the West and being superstitious about foreign countries. As proletarian literary and art workers, it also seems that some people still lack the confidence and pride that they should have in the great title of the proletariat. Even though we are already in an era where "the east wind prevails over the west wind" and "we are getting better day by day, and the enemy is getting worse day by day," there are still some Communist Party writers who regard the literary and artistic achievements of the bourgeois world as unique peaks and as standards for measuring proletarian literature and art. When talking about writers, they are Balzac and Tolstoy, and when talking about works, they are "The Red and the Black" and "Jean-Christophe." They do not think about the fact that bourgeois literature and art have inherited the legacy of the feudal era, and they themselves have accumulated hundreds of years, while our proletariat has only been more than one hundred years since there was the "Communist Manifesto," and only more than forty years since the October Revolution. Bourgeois literature and art are so old that they are about to die, while our proletarian literature and art are still very young. They are getting worse day by day, and we are getting better day by day. Before the proletariat has ascended the historical stage and has not grasped culture, bourgeois literature and art are of course the peak of human culture, but all bourgeois literary and artistic peaks are only bourgeois literary and artistic peaks. Their lives, thoughts, feelings, and even creative methods are bound to be restricted by the times and classes. And we, the proletariat, will not only inherit all the cultural accumulation of mankind since history, including the capitalist era, but also originate from the basis of the laboring masses who account for the vast majority of mankind and serve hundreds of millions of laboring masses. More than a hundred years ago, Marx said in the "Communist Manifesto": "The proletarians have nothing to lose in this revolution but their chains. And what they can gain is the whole world." The proletariat is going to get the whole world, is it only that literature and art cannot be obtained? Of course, in the present when the proletariat has only seized power in the Soviet Union for forty-two years and has only seized power in China for ten years, perhaps bourgeois literature and art are more mature in form, we are younger, they are more exquisite, and we are rougher, but it is very clear that the shortcomings are temporary and can be overcome, which is only a temporary phenomenon in the entire historical development process. Chairman Mao told us as early as in "On New Democracy": The capitalist ideological system and social system have already "set in the west, are dying, people's lives are in danger, and they do not think about the evening," while only the communist ideological system and social system are surging all over the world with the force of overturning mountains and seas and the power of thunder and lightning, and "preserve its wonderful youth." Then, why should we, as proletarian literary and art fighters, bow down to the dying bourgeois literature and art, instead of believing in the youthful power of the proletariat? In the Yan'an era, Chairman Mao regarded American imperialism armed with atomic bombs as a paper tiger, so why can't we regard the bourgeois literature and art, which seems to be still very powerful on the surface today, as a painted face in Peking Opera? Yang Paifeng, the young fire-burning girl in the Yang family, can defeat Jiao Zan and Meng Liang, who are much taller and more majestic than her. Why don't we dare to make ambitious aspirations and create our great achievements? If we don't destroy the prestige of bourgeois literature and art, we can't promote the ambition of proletarian literature and art. If we don't break, we can't establish. It is time to break the superstition of the authority of bourgeois literature and art. Of course, breaking does not mean completely negating. We must have analysis and selectivity. When breaking, we must also adopt a very cautious and meticulous attitude. This is also the problem of what Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us to despise it strategically and attach importance to it tactically.
    There is another problem in film work that needs our attention. The Party instructed us that we should be able to produce at least eight films that serve the peasants and are popular with the peasant masses in 1960. We must guarantee to overfulfill this task.
    Why can't the peasants accept, understand, or like many of the films we have made in the past? Our excellent revolutionary literature and art, especially the excellent works since the Great Leap Forward, have a prominent feature, that is, these works have nationalized and popularized artistic forms. This is worthy of our film workers' attention. Film is the most mass-based art, and the vast majority of the audience is workers and peasants. And some of the films we have made in the past are neither nationalized nor popularized in form. We realize that the problem is not that the art form of film was brought in from abroad and has only been in China for three or forty years, but the main problem is that many film workers themselves who master and produce this art are very foreign and divorced from the masses. The art form of drama is also foreign, but compared with drama, the nationalized and popularized efforts in film creation are far from enough. Our film workers rarely pay attention to the issue of national form that Chairman Mao has long talked about, and often copy the West and dare not break free from the form of foreign films. Premier Zhou has repeatedly warned us that films must be made understandable to the masses, the story must have a beginning and an end, the context must be clear, and the explanation must be clear. Do not jump around, and speak the words that Chinese people speak, and make sure that the audience can hear every word clearly. In my opinion, some people have adopted an attitude of ignoring these important opinions. I said at a meeting that I am very strange. Why are individual film workers not so active in accepting the Party's instructions and have so many difficulties in implementing the Party's policies, but they are so sensitive and active in accepting some so-called new techniques and new techniques in foreign films? Some time ago, some people saw the so-called "poetic montage" technique, and some people accepted it as if they had found a treasure and applied it, regardless of whether it was needed or whether the masses loved it. These people have both "borrowing" and Jia Gui's style. What they lack is the most basic mass viewpoint that is responsible to 500 million peasants. The issue of the form of literature and art is an important issue, and film is no exception. It is inconceivable that the content of the proletariat can be well expressed by using bourgeois - especially the undesirable artistic forms of the late bourgeois - . Therefore, I think that if our film workers - first of all, screenwriters, directors, actors, musicians, and art workers - can break the superstition of Western films and bravely break free from the framework of Western film forms; at the same time, they can continue to go deep into the struggle life of the workers and peasants, learn from the masses, and make the thoughts and feelings of the workers and peasants their own thoughts and feelings, and then make arduous and unremitting efforts on the issue of nationalization and popularization, then I believe that the films that serve 500 million peasants, serve the four modernizations of agriculture, and are popular with the peasants will not be just eight, but eighteen, twenty-eight, or even more.
    The situation is very good now. The situation of the Great Leap Forward is very good, the situation of the people's communes is very good, and the four major indicators of industrial and agricultural production and many important projects have completed the indicators of the second five-year plan within two years. The literacy campaign and the popularization of education are developing rapidly, which has prepared good conditions for the cultural revolution and the technical revolution. Now everything is ready, what we need is only a stronger and greater east wind. What is the east wind? It is Mao Zedong Thought. Taking advantage of this good situation, our comrades in the literary and art circles must work hard to study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. With Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, our team can move forward bravely and win every battle. We will definitely be able to establish a true literary and artistic peak in China - a proletarian literary and artistic peak - in a not too long period of time.

    为电影事业的继续大跃进而奋斗
    夏衍
    十年来，我国电影事业在党的正确领导下，有了很大的进步和发展，特别是大跃进以来，这种进步和发展就变得更加显著。两年来的事实证明，党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，在电影事业中发挥了伟大的作用，取得了辉煌的成就。我只举几件事实来说明这个问题。
    从1949年到大跃进以前的1957年，我国一共只有十个电影制片厂（其中故事片厂六个），摄影棚十九座，到现在，全国已经有三十三个电影制片厂（其中故事片厂十一个），故事片厂的摄影棚二十七座。从放映单位来说，1949年全国只有六百多座电影院，放映队一个也没有，到1957年底，放映单位发展到九千九百六十五个，到1959年底，据初步统计已达到一万四千五百个左右。由于放映网的发展，人民群众看电影的机会就有了很大的增长，1957年全国电影观众十七亿五千万人次，1959年一跃而达到四十亿五千万人次。也就是说，大跃进以来的两年时间，达到了过去用八年时间才能达到的数字。每年观众四十亿人次，这已经是一个不小的数字，特别是和西方资本主义国家的电影观众逐年锐减的情况比较起来，我们的增长就显得非常突出（例如英国，1948年每年电影观众十六亿五千万，1958年激减到七亿五千万，去年，又降低到六亿左右）。当然，按人口比例来说，四十亿这个数字，还是远远不能满足人民群众的要求的。
    其次，从电影制片方面来看，大跃进以来，我们的确在多快好省这四个方面都获得显著的成绩。多（我只举故事片来作例子），从1949年到1957年，八年时间，我们一共生产了艺术片一百七十一部，但是大跃进以后的两年，我们生产的艺术片可达一百八十部左右。这也是大跃进的两年等于乃至超过了过去的八年。快，过去一部故事片实际摄制时间最少是四五个月，多到一年或者一年以上。大跃进以来，生产速度大大加快了，拿去年国庆献礼的十八部艺术片来作例子，绝大部分的摄制时间是四个月到五个月，其中有几部只花了三个月的时间。省，由于产量增加，摄制时间缩短，制片成本也大大降低了。1953年，一部黑白片平均成本二十万元，一部彩色片平均成本六十一万元。1957年，黑白片每部平均十九万元，彩色片平均三十五万元。到了大跃进的1958年，一部黑白片的成本降低到十一万元，彩色片降低到二十五万元，至于纪录性艺术片，1958年一共拍了四十多部，每部平均成本仅五万七千元。至于最重要的“好”的方面，去年国庆献礼的三十六部各种样式的影片，不论在思想、艺术、技术各方面来看，都比过去有了显著的进步。当然，从严格的要求来看，即使是这些较好的献礼影片，也还有各种不同程度的缺点。
    大家知道，在解放前，我国所有的电影器材、设备，完全是依靠外国进口的，现在，除去胶片的片基要到1961年才能自己生产外，其余的器材，我们不仅基本上已经可以自己制造，而且，有了少量的出口，其中某些品种已经赶上了国际水平。在电影技术的尖端科学方面，如全景电影、立体电影，我们已经试制成功。
    我们要充分地、足够地估计和肯定我们的成绩，但是，我们也正视我们的缺点。由于电影是最群众化的艺术，党的最犀利的宣传教育武器之一，所以在电影事业中，一定要把政治思想工作、创作思想问题放在首要的地位，一定要加强党对电影事业的领导，一定要坚定不移地贯彻毛主席的文艺方针，一定要紧紧地沿着鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线前进。
    由于电影界某些党员干部的世界观没有彻底改变，没有真正从一个阶级转变到另一个阶级，所以不论在日常工作中或者创作思想上，就不能坚决地贯彻党的阶级政策、阶级路线，就不能很好地贯彻毛主席的文艺为工农兵服务的方针。
    十年来，在党中央的直接领导下，从1951年对反动电影“武训传”的批判，经过文艺整风，对“红楼梦研究”的批判，对胡风反革命集团的斗争，特别是1957年的整风反右，一直到去年下半年反右倾斗争，电影界几乎不断地进行着政治上、文艺思想上的两条路线的斗争。这种斗争的情况是高一阵、低一阵、一个时期缓和一些、一个时期又变成非常尖锐。例如1955年，经过对胡风反革命集团的斗争（这在文艺思想上是一场剧烈的反修正主义的斗争）之后，紧接着农业合作化高潮、资本主义工商业的全行业合营高潮，电影工作也出现了一片欣欣向荣的气象，电影事业有了很大的进步。可是就在下一年，匈牙利事件之后，首先发起向党的文艺政策进攻的，是电影界党内右派分子钟惦棐的“电影的锣鼓”。党外右派向党的猖狂进攻是在1957年的春季，而钟惦棐的进攻则早在1956年冬季。1957年我们的电影中出了一些毒草和有错误思想的影片，例如“未完成的喜剧”、“谁是被抛弃的人”、“青春的脚步”等。事实上，这些电影剧本多数是和“电影的锣鼓”同时写成，而其中很大部分是在1956年第四季度和1957年上半年摄制的。1957年我们进行了一场剧烈的反右斗争，经过大鸣、大放、大辩论的方法，打退了右派进攻，提高了电影工作者的思想水平和政治觉悟，加强了团结，认清了道路，这才给1958年的电影事业大跃进奠定了基础。反右之后，电影界出现了一种空前未有的大跃进的气象，通过双反运动，向党交心，接着是大批电影工作者下乡下厂，参加劳动锻炼。一方面热烈地响应党中央的号召，制作了三十几部向国庆十周年献礼的优秀影片；同时试用纪录性艺术片的形式，摄制了大量迅速反映工农业大跃进的影片。
    1958年的电影事业大跃进，用事实证明了一条颠扑不破的真理，这就是经过剧烈的思想斗争，经过反对资产阶级文艺思想的斗争，我们的电影事业就能够向前迈进。这也证明了：任何事业只有听党的话，按毛主席的教导办事，政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，事业就能够优质高产，高速度地向前发展，反之，我们的事业就会遭到失败，或者死气沉沉，萎靡不振。
    周扬同志在“文艺战线上的一场大辩论”中说到，反右斗争“给资产阶级反动思想以致命的打击，解放文学艺术界及其后备军的生产力，解除旧社会给他们带上的脚镣手铐，免除反动空气的威胁，替无产阶级文学艺术开辟了一条广泛发展的道路”。这几句话对我们印象很深，启发很大，但是他又接着指出：“这个开辟道路的工作今后还要做，旧基地的清除不是一年工夫可以全部完成的”。现在看来，这几句话的意义是十分深刻，而且是富于革命预见性的。全身浸透在资产阶级思想中的资产阶级知识分子，他们的思想改造是决不能毕其功于一役的。在电影界，“清除旧基地”的历史任务还没有完成，残存在人们头脑里的资产阶级思想——特别是修正主义思想的影响还是相当的严重。
    由于知识分子和作家的世界观问题没有得到彻底的解决，所以现代修正主义容易在文艺工作者之间找到市场。在电影界也是这样。其所以如此，除了很多电影工作者还没有建立起真正的无产阶级的世界观这一个最根本的原因之外，也还有其他的原因。第一是修正主义不以赤裸裸的反对共产主义的姿态出现，而巧妙地披上了一件马克思主义的外衣，所以它有很大的欺骗作用；第二是在革命文艺界里面，有一些作家是修正主义者。第一个问题是世界观的问题、马克思列宁主义水平的问题，也可以说是只有从革命实践中真正建立了无产阶级世界观之后，才能具备的阶级敏感和辨别力的问题。西游记里有许多妖怪，他们的现象和本质很不容易看得清楚，要看出他们的本质，必须有一双慧眼。无产阶级的慧眼从哪儿来，首先是要彻底地改造自己，从一个阶级转变到另一个阶级，成为全心全意忠实于无产阶级革命的战士。同时，要经常地、刻苦地钻研毛主席的著作，拿毛泽东思想作为武器去参加实际斗争，在群众斗争中锻炼自己，提高自己的辨别能力。第二个问题是能不能解放思想、破除迷信的问题，是毛泽东思想培养起来的中国文艺工作者能不能挺起腰干来和一切非无产阶级思想作斗争的问题。由于我们这些人在半封建、半殖民地的中国生活过来，由于我们从小就受到西方资产阶级的教育，所以在我们身上，还相当浓厚地存在着法门寺里的贾桂气质。我们还缺乏无产阶级革命家应有的气概和风格。这也是对毛主席文艺思想重视不足，甚至低估了它的意义的结果。毛泽东同志创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义文艺理论，并且进一步解决了马克思、恩格
  斯、列宁、斯大林在当时还未能解决或者来不及解决的问题。因此，只要我们能够真正掌握毛主席的思想，能够随时运用这个武器来衡量事情和作品，那么，我们就能辨别什么是真马克思主义，什么是假马克思主义，我们也就能够昂起头来，不会吓倒了。
    作为新中国的文艺工作者，有些人还有崇拜西方、迷信外国的民族自卑感。作为无产阶级的文艺工作者，却也似乎还有一些人对无产阶级这个伟大的称号缺乏应有的自信心和自豪感。尽管我们已经处身在“东风压倒西风”、“我们一天天好起来，敌人一天天烂下去”的时代，依然还有一些共产党员作家，把资产阶级世界的文艺成就当作独一无二的高峰，当作衡量无产阶级文艺的标准。谈起作家，就是巴尔扎克、托尔斯泰，谈到作品，就是“红与黑”和“约翰·克里斯朵夫”。他们不想一想资产阶级文艺继承了封建时代的遗产，他们本身也已经有了几百年的积累，而我们无产阶级，从有“共产党宣言”以来只不过一百多年，从十月革命以来也只有四十多年。资产阶级文艺已经老到快要死了，而我们无产阶级文艺则还很年轻。他们在一天天烂下去，我们在一天天好起来。在无产阶级还没有登上历史舞台，还没有掌握文化之前，资产阶级文艺当然是人类文化的高峰，但是，一切资产阶级的文艺高峰，也只不过是资产阶级的文艺高峰。他们的生活、思想、感情、乃至创作方法，都不能不受到时代和阶级的限制。而我们无产阶级则不仅要继承人类有史以来的——包括资本主义时代在内的——全部文化积累，而且是从占人类绝大多数的劳动群众的基础上产生，为亿万劳动群众服务的。一百多年前马克思在“共产党宣言”里说：“无产者在这个革命中失去的只是自己颈上的锁链。而他们所能获得的却是整个世界”。无产阶级将要得到整个世界，难道就只有文艺这一项不能得到吗？当然，在无产阶级在苏联取得政权还只有四十二年，在中国取得政权还只有十年的今天，也许资产阶级文艺在形式上成熟一些，我们年青一些，他们精美一些，我们粗糙一些，但是，这很明白，缺点是暂时的，可以克服的，这只不过是整个历史发展过程中的一个暂时现象。毛主席早在“新民主主义论”中告诉过我们：资本主义的思想体系和社会制度已经“日薄西山，气息奄奄，人命危浅，朝不虑夕”，而只有共产主义思想体系和社会制度，则正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，磅礴于全世界，而“葆其美妙之青春”。那么，我们，作为无产阶级的文艺战士为什么要在奄奄一息的资产阶级文艺前面膜拜顶礼，而不相信无产阶级的青春的力量呢？在延安时代，毛主席将用原子弹武装起来的美帝国主义看作一只纸老虎，那么我们为什么不能把今天表面上似乎还很威风的资产阶级文艺看作京戏里的架子花脸呢？杨家将里的年青的烧火丫头杨排风，可以将比她高大威武得多的架子花脸焦赞、孟良打倒，为什么我们就不敢立下雄心大志，创造我们的丰功伟绩呢？不灭资产阶级文艺的威风，就不能长无产阶级文艺的志气。不破不立，破除对资产阶级文艺权威的迷信，已经是时候了。当然，破，并不等于全盘否定，我们要有分析，要有取舍；在破的时候，也要采取十分慎重、细致的态度。这也就是毛主席一再教导我们的战略上要藐视它，战术上要重视它的问题。
    在电影工作中还有一个问题需要我们注意。党指示我们1960年最少能拍出八部为农民服务、为农民群众所喜闻乐见的电影。这个任务我们要保证超额完成。
    为什么我们过去拍的许多电影农民不能接受，看不懂，或者不欢喜？我们的优秀的革命文艺，特别是大跃进以来的优秀作品，具有一个显著的特点，那就是这些作品具有民族化、群众化的艺术形式。这是值得我们电影工作者注意的。电影是最群众化的艺术，观众的绝大多数是工农群众。而我们过去拍的某些影片，它的形式是既不民族化、又不群众化的。我们体会到，问题不在于电影这种艺术形式从外国传来，在中国只不过三四十年的历史，主要的问题是在于掌握和生产电影这种艺术的不少电影工作者本身，他们洋气很重、而又脱离群众。话剧这种艺术形式也是外来的，但和话剧比较起来，电影创作中的民族化、群众化的努力是十分不够的。我们电影工作者很少注意到毛主席早已讲过的民族形式的问题，往往抄袭西洋，不敢从外国电影的形式套子里解放出来。周总理几次三番地告戒我们，电影一定要让群众看懂，故事要有头有尾，脉络分明，交代清楚，不要跳来跳去，要讲中国人讲的话，每句话要让观众听清楚。对于这些重要的意见，我看，还有些人是采取了置若罔闻的态度的。我曾在一次会议上讲过，我很奇怪，为什么个别的电影工作者接受党的指示这样不积极，贯彻党的方针有这么多的困难，而接受外国电影中的某些所谓新手法、新技巧，却又是那样的敏感，那样的积极？前些时候看到有所谓“诗的蒙太奇”这种手法，有人就如获至宝地接受过来而加以应用了，不管需要不需要，群众爱不爱。这种人既有“拿来主义”，又有贾桂作风，他们所缺少的，就是最起码的、对五亿农民负责的群众观点。文艺的形式问题是重要问题，电影也不例外。不能设想，用资产阶级——特别是资产阶级末期的不足取的艺术形式，能够很好地表达无产阶级的内容。因此我想，假如我们电影工作者——首先是编剧、导演、演员、音乐、美术工作者们，一方面能够破除对西方电影的迷信，勇敢地从西方电影形式的框子里解放出来；同时，又能够继续深入工农群众的斗争生活，向群众学习，使工农群众的思想感情成为自己的思想感情，再对民族化、群众化这个问题作出艰苦、顽强的努力，那么，我相信，为五亿农民服务、为农业四化服务、而又为农民所喜闻乐见的电影，将不止八部，而是十八部，二十八部，或者更多一些。
    现在形势很好。大跃进的形势很好，人民公社的形势很好，工农业生产的四大指标和许多重要项目，都已经在两年内完成了第二个五年计划的指标。扫盲运动和普及教育正在迅速发展，这替文化革命、技术革命准备了很好的条件。现在万事俱备，我们需要的只是更强更大的东风。东风是什么，就是毛泽东思想。趁此大好形势，我们文艺界的同志们一定要努力学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东同志的著作。有了毛泽东思想作武器，我们这支队伍就可以勇往直前，百战百胜。我们就一定能在不太长的时期之内，在中国建立起真正的文艺高峰——无产阶级的文艺高峰。
