Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 6th dispatch: People of vision in Indonesia have continuously expressed the hope that Indonesia and China will resolve the issue of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia through negotiations based on the Bandung spirit.

Indonesian Progressive Nationalist Party Member of Parliament, Zodi Gondokusumo, stated on January 29th during a parliamentary debate on the anti-Chinese proposal put forward by People's Party MP Sutomo and others, that the Indonesian government should try to negotiate with China. He pointed out that maintaining harmonious relations between Indonesia and China means consolidating the anti-imperialist fortress of Asia and Africa. This fortress is very useful for the Indonesian people's future struggle to recover West Irian.

Gondokusumo also pointed out that while Indonesia is building a national economy, it should also guarantee the Bandung spirit and utilize the economy of non-nationals.

Gondokusumo refuted Sutomo's anti-Chinese fallacies point by point. He believes that even if the Indonesian economy is to be socialized, the trade of foreign nationals cannot be transferred to Indonesian businessmen.

Prior to this, Gondokusumo and five other MPs proposed an amendment to Sutomo's anti-Chinese proposal on the 20th. Sutomo and others' anti-Chinese proposal, put forward at the end of last December, expressed support for Presidential Decree No. 10, which prohibits foreign small traders from operating in rural areas. In this amendment, Gondokusumo and other MPs requested the government to hold negotiations with China in order to reach an agreement on resolving the Overseas Chinese issue based on the principle of strengthening Asian-African solidarity. They also asked the government to guarantee the implementation of the Bandung spirit. The proposal stated: This is the basis of the Subandrio-Chen Yi Joint Communiqué.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 6th dispatch: While influential groups in Indonesia continue to engage in anti-Chinese activities, and China is conducting consultations with the Indonesian authorities through diplomatic channels on the issue of Overseas Chinese, the Indonesian newspaper "Eastern Star" published two consecutive editorials on December 30th and 31st of last year, advocating that the Overseas Chinese issue between Indonesia and China should be handled in accordance with international law and conventions.

The newspaper stated that if international law and conventions are used as guiding principles for resolving the issue, then the Subandrio-Chen Yi Joint Communiqué should serve as a guiding principle for handling the Overseas Chinese issue.

The newspaper emphasized that, according to international conventions and international law, after the foreign ministers of China and Indonesia signed the joint communiqué, the two countries assumed obligations; therefore, Indonesia should not take unilateral actions such as prohibiting Overseas Chinese small traders from operating in rural areas and forcing them to relocate.

"Eastern Star Newspaper" referred to the large-scale forced relocation of Overseas Chinese in West Java after the foreign ministers of the two countries signed the joint communiqué, saying: This relocation is not an ordinary relocation, but a large-scale one. The situation of the forced relocated Overseas Chinese is in fact the same as that of exiled people. Without a doubt, they will all lose their livelihoods, therefore, they will have to leave Indonesia, even though they have done nothing wrong.

In its editorial, "Eastern Star Newspaper" urged the Indonesian government to pay attention to providing return travel expenses to Overseas Chinese returning to China and fulfilling other conditions for them. It said that in view of international law, we cannot help but ask: Is the country that takes exile action prepared to provide repatriation expenses and fulfill other conditions?

In its editorial, "Eastern Star Newspaper" also refuted various reasons fabricated by the Indonesian authorities and certain anti-Chinese elements to promote anti-Chinese activities. It expressed its disagreement with the Indonesian authorities' practice of using the so-called "socialist" transformation of the Indonesian economy as a "reason" for taking anti-Chinese measures. The newspaper said that the Indonesian authorities believe that the commercial activities of foreign small traders should be replaced by cooperatives that are considered a socialist form. This is the only reason officially put forward by Indonesia. However, unfortunately, the relevant authorities stipulated in the implementing regulations that before the establishment of cooperatives, the shops of foreign small traders can be transferred to private individuals. This inevitably greatly weakens the strength of the so-called socialist reason. Therefore, in any case, our government itself has denied the official reason it put forward.

The newspaper also refuted the erroneous view of some people that the Indonesian side has the right to order all Overseas Chinese in rural areas of West Java to move, and foreign countries have no right to interfere in this matter, because this is Indonesia's internal affairs. The newspaper pointed out that if viewed from the conventions and provisions of international law, this would be untenable.

    印度尼西亚有识之士不断表示
    应以万隆精神谈判解决华侨问题
    “东星报”认为应以两国外长联合公报作为解决问题的指导原则
    新华社6日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚有远见的人士不断表示希望印度尼西亚和中国根据万隆精神通过谈判来解决在印度尼西亚的华侨的问题。
    印度尼西亚进步民族系议员佐迪·龚多古苏莫1月29日在国会就人民党议员苏托莫等人提出的排华提案进行辩论时发言说，印度尼西亚政府应该设法同中国谈判。他指出，维护印度尼西亚和中国的融洽关系，意味着巩固亚非的反帝堡垒。这个堡垒对于印度尼西亚人民将来收复西伊里安的斗争是非常有用的。
    龚多古苏莫还指出，印度尼西亚在建立国民经济的时候，它也应该保证万隆精神，并且利用非本国人的经济。
    龚多古苏莫逐点驳斥了苏托莫等人的排华谬论。他认为印度尼西亚经济要社会主义化，也不能把外国侨民的贸易移交给印度尼西亚商人掌握。
    在这以前，龚多古苏莫和其他五位议员于20日对苏托莫等人的排华提案提出一项修正动议。苏托莫等人于去年12月底提出的排华提案表示支持禁止乡村外侨小商贩营业的总统第十号法令。龚多古苏莫等议员在这项修正动议中，要求政府同中国举行谈判，以便在加强亚非团结的原则下就解决华侨问题达成协议。他们还要求政府保证实现万隆精神。提案说：这是苏班德里约—陈毅联合公报的基础。
    新华社6日讯　雅加达消息：在印度尼西亚有势力的集团继续进行排华活动和中国通过外交途径同印度尼西亚当局就华侨问题进行商谈的过程中，印度尼西亚“东星报”曾经在去年12月30日和31日连续发表两篇社论，主张根据国际法的惯例和规定来处理印度尼西亚和中国之间的华侨问题。
    这家报纸说，如果以国际法的惯例和规定作为解决问题的指导原则，那么就应该以苏班德里约—陈毅联合公报作为处理华侨问题的指导原则。
    这家报纸着重指出，按照国际惯例和国际法的规定，在中国和印度尼西亚两国外交部长签署了联合公报以后，两国就承担了义务；这样，印度尼西亚就不应该采取禁止乡村地区华侨小商贩营业和迫使他们迁居的单方面行动。
    “东星报”谈到印度尼西亚在两国外交部长签署这项联合公报以后，在西爪哇所采取的大规模迫迁华侨的行动，它说：这种迁移并不是普通的迁移，而是大规模进行的迁移。被迫迁的华侨的境况事实上同被放逐的人一样。毫无疑问，他们全部都将丧失生计，因此，他们将不得不离开印度尼西亚，虽然他们没有做过甚么错事。
    “东星报”在社论中促请印度尼西亚政府注意给返回中国的华侨以回国旅费和对他们履行其它条件。它说，鉴于国际法，我们不能不问：那个采取放逐行动的国家是否准备提供遣返费用，并且履行其它条件。
    “东星报”在社论中还驳斥了印度尼西亚当局和某些排华分子为推行排华活动而制造的种种理由。它表示不能同意印度尼西亚当局以所谓印度尼西亚经济将改变为“社会主义”经济作为采取排华措施的“理由”的做法。报纸说，印度尼西亚当局认为外侨小商贩的商业活动应该由被认为是社会主义形式的合作社取而代之。这是印度尼西亚所正式提出的唯一的理由。但是，不幸的是，有关当局在关于执行的条例中规定：在合作社成立之前，外侨小商贩的商店可以移交给私人。这不可避免地大大削弱了所谓的社会主义的理由的力量。因此，无论如何，我们的政府自己否定了它所提出的那个正式理由。
    这家报纸还驳斥了某些人士的这样一种错误观点，即认为印度尼西亚方面有权命令西爪哇乡村地区的所有华侨迁移，外国无权干涉这件事，因为这是印度尼西亚的内政。报纸指出，假如从国际法的惯例和规定来看，这将是站不住脚的。
