Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, February 17th: TASS reported from Rangoon on February 16th: The President of the Union of Burma, U Win Maung, hosted a banquet on the evening of February 16th in honor of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev.

Attending the banquet were Khrushchev's entourage and the Soviet Ambassador to Burma, Ledovsky. The Prime Minister of Burma, General Ne Win, and other Burmese government officials also attended the banquet.

U Win Maung said in his speech at the banquet that Khrushchev's visit to Burma would not only confirm the close friendship between Burma and the Soviet Union but also confirm the principles on which this friendship is based. He said, "Although the relationship between our two countries has only been established in the last decade, adherence to the principles of peaceful coexistence that we uphold has given us a closer relationship, mutual trust, and mutual respect. The economic cooperation, cultural exchanges, and other exchanges of goodwill between our two countries are proof of this."

U Win Maung praised the achievements of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union in developing their great country and in science, industry, society, and culture. He said, "We believe that the outstanding achievements of the Soviet people in interstellar research will serve the peaceful progress of all mankind."

U Win Maung said: The recent easing of international tensions "reflects a growing understanding that the most important international issues, no matter how complex they may be, can and should be resolved through peaceful means. Therefore, we welcome the upcoming summit meeting, which should bring about positive results."

In his reply speech, Khrushchev expressed his gratitude for the warm reception he received in Rangoon. He said that, as four years ago, the sincere reception and warm welcome in the Burmese capital, Rangoon, for us, the representatives of the Soviet Union, once again moved me deeply. We want to fully convey these friendly expressions towards the Soviet people to the Soviet people, who have always held heartfelt sympathy for the heroic struggle of the Burmese people to consolidate political and economic independence and to consolidate world peace.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet people and the Burmese people are united in a single front in the lofty struggle for peace. The Soviet Union welcomes Burma's peaceful foreign policy because it makes a due contribution to the common cause. The Burmese Parliament passed a resolution in 1957 on disarmament and the non-continuation of the production and testing of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and rocket weapons. It also supported the Soviet Union's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament at the United Nations. These all prove that the Union of Burma is closely concerned with solving the most pressing issues of the present era. Khrushchev expressed the hope that Burma, which has always loved peace and is loyal to Aung San's legacy, will continue to be at the forefront of active peace fighters and make new contributions to the cause of lasting world peace.

Khrushchev said: "The Soviet Union and its government fully understand and sympathize with the struggle of the Burmese people and government to consolidate their independence and sovereignty, and to strive for the upsurge of national economy and culture, and are always ready to provide Burmese friends with fraternal assistance and support in this regard."

He said: "Our two countries not only coexist peacefully but are also mutually friendly." He expressed the hope that the current visit would help strengthen the good cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Union of Burma, for the benefit of both countries and world peace.

On the same day, Khrushchev called on the President of the Union of Burma, U Win Maung. In the afternoon, the Prime Minister of Burma, General Ne Win, called on Khrushchev and held talks with him.

In addition, Khrushchev also met with U Nu, the leader of the Clean Faction of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma.

    缅甸总统宴请赫鲁晓夫
    赫鲁晓夫说苏联支持缅甸巩固民族独立的斗争
    吴温貌说和平共处原则使苏缅建立紧密的关系
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社仰光16日讯：缅甸联邦总统吴温貌16日晚间设宴招待苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫。
    出席宴会的还有赫鲁晓夫的随行人员、苏联驻缅甸大使列多夫斯基。缅甸总理奈温将军和其他缅甸政府官员也出席了宴会。
    吴温貌在宴会上致词说，赫鲁晓夫这次访问缅甸不仅能够证实缅苏两国间的紧密的友谊，而且证实作为这个友谊的基础的原则。他说：“虽然我们两国之间的关系仅仅在最近十年里才确立起来，但是信奉我们所奉行的和平共处的原则使我们获得了更紧密的关系、互相信任和互相尊敬。我们两国间的经济合作、文化交流和其他善良意愿的交流就证实了这点。”
    吴温貌赞扬了苏联各族人民在发展他们伟大的国家、在科学、工业、社会和文化各方面所取得的成就。他说，我们相信，苏联人民在星际研究方面的卓越成就，将为全人类的和平进步服务。
    吴温貌说：最近国际紧张局势的缓和，“反映了对这样一点的日益了解：即最重大的国际问题，不论它们怎样复杂，都可以而且应当通过和平的途径来解决。因此我们欢迎即将举行的最高级会晤，这种会晤应当带来积极的结果。”
    赫鲁晓夫致答词时，对他在仰光所受到的热情接待表示感谢。他说，正如四年前一样，缅甸首都仰光对我们、苏联的代表们的诚挚接待和热情欢迎又一次使我感到深深激动。我们要把这些对苏联人民的友好表现完全带给苏联人民，苏联人民对缅甸人民争取巩固政治和经济的独立以及巩固世界和平的英勇斗争一直抱着衷心的同情。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联人民和缅甸人民在争取和平的崇高的斗争中结成一条战线。苏联欢迎缅甸的和平外交政策，因为它对共同的事业作出了应有的贡献。缅甸议会在1957年曾经通过关于裁军和不继续生产和试验原子武器、氢武器以及火箭武器的决议。它还支持苏联在联合国提出的全面彻底裁军的建议。这些都证明，缅甸联邦密切关心解决当代最迫切的问题。赫鲁晓夫表示希望，一向爱好和平的缅甸、忠于昂山的遗教的缅甸今后仍将走在积极的和平战士的行列中，并对争取世界持久和平的事业中作出新的贡献。
    赫鲁晓夫说：“苏联和它的政府极其谅解和同情缅甸人民和政府争取巩固自己的独立和主权、争取民族经济和文化高涨的斗争，并且始终准备给予缅甸朋友们在这方面以兄弟般的援助和支持。”
    他说：“我们两国不仅和平地共处着，而且相互友好。”他表示希望：目前的访问将有助于加强苏联和缅甸联邦之间的良好合作，以有利于两国和世界和平。
    同一天赫鲁晓夫拜会了缅甸联邦总统吴温貌。当天下午缅甸总理奈温将军拜会了赫鲁晓夫，并同他举行了会谈。
    此外，赫鲁晓夫还会见了缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟廉洁派领袖吴努。
