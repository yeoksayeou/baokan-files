    Comparing to Famous Brands, Catching Up with Famous Brands, Creating Famous Brands
    Nanjing Produces a Batch of High-Quality Light Industrial Products

The movement of chasing and creating famous brand products launched by workers in Nanjing's light industrial and textile industrial enterprises has achieved remarkable results. Recently, after joint evaluation and appraisal by technical personnel and salespersons from relevant units and commercial departments, the quality of 28 products, including "Nanjing" brand batteries, "Gulou" brand soap, "Peony" brand pomade, mushroom canned goods, "Jinling Wuliangye" liquor, "Zijinshan" brand pocket watches, "Worker-Peasant-Soldier" brand undershirts, sports shirts, "Peacock" bed sheets, herringbone woolens, checkered poplin, velvet, silk velvet, Xingdou Ge, and velvet satin, has reached the level of similar famous brand products in Shanghai, Tianjin, Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places. In addition, 11 newly created products, including "Gulou" brand matches, applique porcelain-lined cups, famous dish canned goods, double-sided yarn card, and gold velvet, are also considered to be high-quality products.

Workers in Nanjing's light industrial and textile industrial system have high aspirations and set ambitious goals, proposing the slogan "Humbly learn to compare with famous brands, catch up with famous brands with full confidence, and create famous brands with soaring enthusiasm," striving to improve product quality. The first step in catching up with famous brands is to compare with famous brands. They carefully analyzed the characteristics of famous brand products from other places, understood their strengths in terms of quality and packaging decoration, and compared them with their own factory's products to identify differences. Then, they organized technical personnel and skilled workers to learn from relevant advanced units, and after returning to the factory, they quickly organized on-site operation demonstrations, imparted the advanced experience of advanced units, and mobilized the masses to actively improve operations, improve formulas, and equipment, and strive to catch up with famous brand products. For example, the three-color cased glass cups produced by the Lüda Glass Factory are transparent and beautiful. The Nanjing Glass Factory specially purchased samples from the Guangzhou Exhibition, carefully studied them, and organized a special group to study in Lüda. After returning to the factory, they formulated eight specific indicators to catch up. With the workers' humble learning and diligent research, the color separation, cup shape, stress, and other indicators have now caught up with the products of Lüda.

In the process of catching up with famous brand products, the workers of each factory overcame the difficulties in equipment and technical conditions with tenacious perseverance. The "Nanjing" brand battery produced by the Zhengming Battery Factory originally had a light-emitting time of only about 600 minutes, which was about 100 minutes less than the Shanghai "Da Wuwei" brand battery. This factory is relatively small, has a short history of battery production, relies heavily on manual operation, and the specifications of raw materials are often not readily available, which is much worse than the conditions of the Shanghai Da Wuwei Battery Factory. However, after learning from Shanghai, the workers creatively applied advanced experience and quickly improved product ingredients and quality, stabilizing the light-emitting time at 860 minutes, which is 160 minutes more than the light-emitting time of the "Da Wuwei" brand battery.

While catching up with famous brand products, many factories have paid close attention to creating new products with unique styles and creating their own famous brand products. In order to allow people living abroad and traveling to other places to eat famous Chinese dishes, the workers of the Nanjing Canned Food Factory decided to produce canned famous dishes with national flavors. They studied diligently and painstakingly, and under the guidance of some famous chefs, they finally produced 16 kinds of famous dish canned goods with good color, aroma, and taste, such as Jinling meat, Consort Chicken, and preserved fish. While improving the quality of "Windmill" brand matches, the Nanjing Match Factory also produced "Gulou" brand matches with high striking ability. This kind of match can be lit within level 3 winds and is very safe to use.

At present, various factories are further carrying out the "comparing to famous brands, catching up with famous brands, and creating famous brands" movement. They proposed: quickly organize mass production of products that have caught up with famous brands, and continuously consolidate and improve quality; those that have not yet caught up should quickly catch up, ensuring that they catch up in the short term, and at the same time, strive to create more light industrial and textile industrial products with unique styles and local characteristics to better meet the needs of the people.

    比名牌　赶名牌　创名牌
    南京制出一批轻工业优质产品
    新华社南京20日电　南京市轻工业和纺织工业企业职工开展的追赶和创造名牌货的运动，获得显著成绩。最近，经有关单位和商业部门的技术人员、营业员共同评比鉴定，已经有“南京”牌电池、“鼓楼”牌肥皂、“牡丹”牌香脂、麻菇罐头、“金陵五粮液”白酒、“紫金山”牌怀表、“工农兵”牌卫生衫、球衫、“孔雀”被单、人字呢、格子府绸、天鹅绒、真丝绒、星斗葛、绒面缎等二十八种产品的质量，分别赶上上海、天津、苏州、无锡等地同类名牌产品的水平。另有新创的“鼓楼”牌火柴、贴花瓷衬口杯、名菜罐头、双面纱卡、金丝绒等十一种产品，也被认为是质量优良的高级产品。
    南京市轻工、纺织工业系统职工树雄心，立大志，提出“虚心学习比名牌，信心百倍赶名牌，干劲冲天创名牌”的口号，努力提高产品质量。赶名牌的第一步是比名牌。他们仔细分析外地名牌产品的特点，了解它们在质量方面和包装装饰等方面的长处，对照本厂产品，找出差异。接着，就组织技术人员和技工前往有关先进单位学习，回厂以后又迅速组织现场操作表演，传授先进单位的先进经验，发动群众积极改进操作、改进配方和设备，奋力追赶名牌货。如旅大玻璃厂生产的三色套料杯透明美观，南京玻璃厂特地从广州展览会上购来样品，仔细研究，并且组织专门小组去旅大学习，回厂以后，订出八项追赶的具体指标。在职工们虚心学习和刻苦钻研下，现在，套色、杯型、应力等指标都赶上了旅大的产品。
    在赶名牌产品过程中，各厂职工以顽强的毅力克服了设备和技术条件上的困难。正明电池厂生产的“南京牌”电池，原来放光时间只有六百分钟左右，比上海“大无畏”牌电池少一百分钟左右。这个厂规模比较小，生产电池的历史短，手工操作比重大，原料材料的规格也常常不能得心应手，条件比上海大无畏电池厂差得多。但是职工们从上海取经回来以后，创造性地运用先进经验，很快改进了产品配料和质量，使放光时间稳定在八百六十分钟，比“大无畏”牌电池的放光时间还多一百六十分钟。
    在赶名牌产品的同时，许多厂都十分注意创造具有独特风格的新产品，创造自己的名牌货。南京罐头食品厂职工，为使旅居国外和旅行外地的人吃到中国名菜，决定生产具有民族风味的名菜罐头。他们勤学苦钻，在一些名厨师的指导下，终于制成色、香、味都很好的金陵肉、贵妃鸡、腊鱼等十六种名菜罐头。南京火柴厂在提高“风车”牌火柴质量的同时，还制成了擦划能力很高的“鼓楼”牌火柴。这种火柴在三级风以内都可点燃，使用很安全。
    目前，各厂正在进一步开展“比名牌、赶名牌、创名牌”的运动。他们提出：赶上名牌的产品迅速组织成批生产，并不断巩固和提高质量；尚未赶上的急起直追，保证在短期内赶上，同时还要努力创造更多的具有独特风格和地方色彩的轻工、纺织工业产品，更好地适应人民需要。
