(Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 8th dispatch) Under the impetus of the mass cotton field high-yield plot movement, the counties and cities in Guanzhong, a famous high-yield cotton area, have started early, progressed rapidly, and maintained good quality in their preparations for cotton field sowing this year.

The cotton field sowing area in the Guanzhong region accounts for over 90% of the province's planned cotton field sowing area this year, with high-yield plots accounting for nearly half of the total cotton field area in this region.

The mass cotton field high-yield plot movement is a further development of Shaanxi Province's efforts to promote Zhang Qiuxiang's high-yield cotton experience over the years. In the past few years, Shaanxi Province has been promoting Zhang Qiuxiang's high cotton yield experience, expanding from one point to multiple points, and then from points to a wider area, ensuring a steady increase in cotton production. In 1955, Zhang Qiuxiang's single 1.05 mu of cotton field created a record of 1,000 jin of seed cotton. By 1957, the "Qiuxiang Fields" designated as high-yielding covered about 10,000 mu, and high-yield fields were scattered throughout the Guanzhong area. By the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, there were over 4,000 "Qiuxiang Cotton Planting Groups," and high-yield fields had developed from points to larger areas. After collectivization, extremely favorable conditions were provided for promoting Zhang Qiuxiang's high cotton yield experience on a larger scale and obtaining larger areas of high-yield cotton. In many areas, larger areas of high-yield cotton fields had already appeared, resulting in rapid increases in cotton production in these areas. Last year, Sanyuan County had 231 Qiuxiang Cotton Planting Groups, with 2,997 mu averaging over 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and 220,000 mu averaging over 150 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Under the leadership of these "Qiuxiang Fields" and high-yield plots, the county's 720,000 mu of cotton fields averaged over 90 jin of ginned cotton per mu.

After summarizing the above experience, the relevant leading departments in Shaanxi Province believed that vigorously developing cotton field high-yield plots was a concrete measure to implement the policy of combining high yields with more harvests and multiple varieties with more harvests. It could greatly increase the yield of cotton in high-yield plots and promote the high yield of entire cotton fields. Therefore, under the current conditions, vigorously developing the cotton field high-yield plot movement is an important link in ensuring the rapid growth of cotton production. To this end, as early as late November last year, a cotton high-yield leap forward on-site meeting was held in Sanyuan County, which determined that the movement to develop high-yield cotton fields should be launched in cotton-producing areas, and proposed various specific measures to implement the tasks, indicators, and measures in a timely manner to production teams. Sanyuan, Dali, Weinan, Pucheng, Tongchuan, Hancheng, and Zhouzhi, seven major cotton-producing counties and cities, as well as some key cotton-producing communes and production teams, also successively convened cotton high-yield professional meetings, on-site meetings, and leap forward meetings to make specific arrangements for cotton field high-yield plots, establish professional groups for planting cotton in high-yield plots, and fix the land plots. Zhouzhi County alone organized more than 1,100 Qiuxiang high-yield crop groups, and put up signs in the fields. Subsequently, the cotton field preparation work centered on the mass development of cotton field high-yield plots was immediately launched.

The result of the mass development of cotton high-yield plots in the Guanzhong area is that it has accelerated the progress of cotton field preparation work and improved the quality of preparation. To date, more than 95% of the cotton fields have been deeply ploughed in winter, generally to a depth of six to eight inches, about half a month earlier than in previous years. Last year, only 30% of the land was fertilized at the bottom in conjunction with winter deep ploughing, while this year, the proportion of land fertilized at the bottom in conjunction with winter ploughing has reached over 60%. All localities have universally carried out land leveling in accordance with the requirements of high-standard garden management. The 200,000 mu of high-yield plots in Dali have basically achieved high-standard garden management, universally leveled the land, straightened all roads and canals, achieved land as flat as a mirror, and ridges as straight as a line, and achieved deep ploughing mu by mu, fertilization plot by plot, and winter irrigation area by area. While concentrating on irrigating wheat fields in the winter, all localities have also carried out winter irrigation of cotton fields. At present, the winter-irrigated cotton fields have reached 775,000 mu, accounting for 38.4% of the irrigable area of cotton fields. The strip-seeding machines needed for sowing have been basically prepared, which can ensure that all localities basically complete sowing within five to seven days. The pesticides and fertilizers needed for cotton fields in the first quarter have been allocated and are sufficient for seed treatment and insect prevention. At the same time, all localities have universally carried out the prevention and control of overwintering pests. At present, more than 40,000 jin of overwintering pink bollworms have been eliminated, and more than 11.4 billion jin of weeds have been removed. Inspection, fine selection, sun drying, and other tasks have also begun. All these preparations have created favorable conditions for striving for a bumper cotton harvest this year.

Currently, all counties and cities in the Guanzhong area are conducting major inspections and making up for any deficiencies in cotton field preparation work, and are strengthening certain weak links in the current preparation work to launch a more in-depth and meticulous preparation upsurge. In particular, in response to the current drought situation, efforts are being made to carry out spring irrigation and harrowing to conserve soil moisture, striving to prepare the land well and ensure timely sowing in the absence of soaking rain.

    发展张秋香棉花丰产经验　保证棉花产量高速度增长
    陕西大搞棉田丰产方运动
    著名棉产区关中地区棉田丰产方占播种总面积将近一半
    备耕工作又早又快又好，目前正加强春灌保墒保证适时播种
    本报西安8日电　著名的棉花高产区——关中各县市，在大搞棉田丰产方运动的推动下，今年棉田播种准备工作动手早，进度快，质量好。
    关中地区今年棉田播种面积占全省今年棉田计划播种面积的90％以上，其中丰产方的棉田占这个地区棉田总面积的将近一半。
    大搞棉田丰产方运动，是陕西省历年来推广张秋香棉花丰产经验的进一步发展的结果。过去几年来，陕西省在推广张秋香的棉花高产经验中，由一点到多点，再由点到面，保证了棉花产量稳步上升。1955年还只有张秋香的一点零五亩棉田创造了千斤籽棉的纪录，到1957年被命为高产的“秋香田”就有万亩左右，高产田已经在关中地区星罗棋布。到大跃进的1958年，就出现了四千多个“秋香植棉小组”，高产田已经由点发展到了较大的面积。公社化以后，为更大规模地推广张秋香棉花高产经验，获得更大面积的棉花丰产，提供了极为有利的条件，不少地区已经出现了较大面积的棉田丰产方，使这些地区棉花的产量很快有了飞跃的增长。去年，三原全县有二百三十一个秋香植棉小组，有二千九百九十七亩平均亩产皮棉二百斤以上，有二十二万亩平均亩产皮棉一百五十斤以上，在这些“秋香田”和丰产方的带动下，全县七十二万亩棉田亩产皮棉在九十斤以上。
    陕西省有关领导部门总结了上述经验以后，认为大搞棉田丰产方，是具体贯彻高产多收和多种多收相结合方针的具体措施，既可大大提高丰产方棉花的产量，又可推动整个棉田的丰产，因此，在目前条件下，大搞棉田丰产方运动，是保证棉花产量迅速增长的一个重要环节。为此，早在去年11月下旬，就在三原县举行了棉花丰产跃进现场会议，确定在产棉区大搞棉田丰产方运动，提出了各项具体措施，及时把任务、指标、措施落实到生产小队。三原、大荔、渭南、蒲城、铜川、韩城、盩厔七个主要产棉县市及部分重点产棉公社、生产队，还先后召开了棉花丰产专业会、现场会和跃进会，对棉田丰产方作了具体安排，建立了丰产方植棉专业组，固定了地块。单是盩厔县就组织了一千一百多个秋香高产作物小组，地头上插了牌子。接着，以大搞棉田丰产方为中心的棉田备耕工作就立即展开了。
    关中地区大搞棉花丰产方的结果，既加快棉田备耕工作的进度，又提高备耕质量。到目前为止，95％以上的棉田都进行了冬季深翻，深度一般达六至八寸，比往年提前半月左右。去年结合冬季深翻施底肥的只有30％，今年结合冬翻已施底肥达60％以上。各地普遍根据高标准园田化的要求，进行平整土地，大荔的二十万亩丰产方，基本上作到了高标准园田化，普遍平整了土地，将所有的道路、水渠裁弯取直，做到了地平如镜，埂直如线，并做到了亩亩深翻、块块施肥、片片冬灌。各地在冬季干旱集中灌溉麦田的同时，也结合进行了棉田冬灌，目前冬灌的棉田已达七十七万五千亩，占棉田可灌面积的38．4％。播种所需的条播机已经基本准备就绪，可以保证各地在五至七天内基本播种完毕。第一季度棉田所需要的农药和化肥，已经调拨下去，足够药剂拌种和防虫之用。同时，各地普遍进行了防治越冬虫害工作，目前已扫除越冬红铃虫四万多斤，除草一百一十四亿多斤。检查、精选、晒种等等工作也已开始。所有这些准备工作，都为争取今年棉花的大丰收，创造了良好的条件。
    目前，关中地区各县市，对棉田备耕工作正在进行大查大补，并加强当前备耕工作中的某些薄弱环节，更深入细致的掀起备耕热潮。特别是针对目前的干旱情况，开展春灌和耙?保墒工作，力争在不下透雨的情况下，整好地，保证适时播种。
