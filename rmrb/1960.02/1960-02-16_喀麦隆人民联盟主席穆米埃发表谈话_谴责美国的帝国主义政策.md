Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 13th. Cameroonian People's Union Chairman Félix Moumié condemned America's imperialist policies in Africa at a press conference held here today.

He said that the United States must be held responsible for the situation in Cameroon. It is the United States that provides France with weapons and helicopters to suppress the Cameroonian people; it is also the United States that supports France's claims in the United Nations. Moumié said, "It is because of these things that we vehemently condemn the United States." The Cameroonian People's Union leader arrived here from Tunisia after just attending the Second All-African People's Conference. He said that the conference emphasized the danger of neo-colonialism and warned the people of African countries not to be deceived by false independence.

Moumié pointed out that when the imperialists realized that they could not suppress the struggle of the African people, they established local governments that were ostensibly nationalist. However, these governments are at the beck and call of Brussels, Paris, London, and Washington. The Cameroonian People's Union opposes the "referendum" on the new Cameroonian constitution that will be held under the bayonets of the French army. In response to a question, Moumié said, "The so-called 'communist threat' has always been an excuse used by imperialists to suppress the people's struggle for independence. The Cameroonian issue is not a question of communism or non-communism. The real question is whether the people can enjoy the right to decide their own destiny as stipulated in the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."

    喀麦隆人民联盟主席穆米埃发表谈话
    谴责美国的帝国主义政策
    据新华社开罗13日电　喀麦隆人民联盟主席费利克斯·穆米埃今天在这里举行的记者招待会上谴责美国对非洲的帝国主义政策。
    他说，美国必须对喀麦隆的局势负责。为法国提供武器和直升飞机镇压喀麦隆人民的，正是美国；支持法国在联合国的主张的，也是美国。穆米埃说，“正是因为这些，我们才激烈谴责美国。”这位喀麦隆人民联盟领袖在刚开完第二届全非人民大会以后从突尼斯到达这里。他说，这次大会强调指出了新殖民主义的危险，并警告非洲各国人民不要受假独立的欺骗。
    穆米埃指出，当帝国主义者认识到，他们镇压不了非洲人民的斗争的时候，他们就建立了表面上是民族主义的当地政府。但是这些政府是听从布鲁塞尔、巴黎、伦敦和华盛顿的摆布的。喀麦隆人民联盟反对即将在法国军队刺刀下就喀麦隆新宪法举行“公民投票”。穆米埃在回答问题时说，“所谓‘共产主义威胁’一直是帝国主义者利用来镇压人民争取独立的斗争的借口。喀麦隆问题不是共产主义或非共产主义的问题。真正的问题是，人民是否能够享受联合国宪章和人权宣言所规定的自己决定自己命运的权利。”
