Rapeseed oil is a necessary non-staple food raw material for people's lives and an indispensable material for national economic construction. The demand for oil by people's lives and national economic construction is growing rapidly, requiring an acceleration of oil production while increasing grain production at a high speed. Rapeseed occupies an important position among oil crops. The planting area of rapeseed has historically accounted for more than 30% of the total area of all oil crops in the country except soybeans. The actual oil production of rapeseed each year accounts for about 35%-40% of the total actual oil production of the three main oil crops: peanuts, rapeseed, and sesame. Rapeseed oil is the main edible oil for people in the Yangtze River basin; rapeseed oil cake is a highly effective fertilizer. Currently, various regions are vigorously developing pig farming, and rapeseed pods and stalks are good feed for pigs. According to analysis, the feed made from rapeseed stalks and pods contains 14 grams of crude protein per kilogram, which is about 3 grams more than the protein content of the better green fodder, water hyacinth, and also contains more fat. Farmers in Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, praised the benefits of increasing rapeseed production: "Rapeseed produces oil, brings money and oil, pods serve as feed, no need to worry about fertilizer, achieving three gains at once, one field equals three."

However, to develop rapeseed production and strive for a bumper rapeseed harvest, it is still necessary to resolve the following cognitive issues.

Is rapeseed really a low-yielding crop? This is a question that must be clarified first. In the past, many people only saw that rapeseed yields were not high and regarded it as a low-yielding crop. In fact, the low rapeseed yields in the past were mainly because the strength of the farmers had not been fully organized and played to its maximum effect. At that time, it was only possible to focus on solving grain production, and it was not possible to invest more effort in rapeseed and other crops. Therefore, people did not engage in intensive cultivation, even adopting a "harvest if there is, discard if there isn't" attitude. How could rapeseed yields be improved under such circumstances? Since the Great Leap Forward and the establishment of people's communes in 1958, relying on the strong organizational power of the people's communes, many places have changed backward farming habits, implemented intensive cultivation, applied sufficient fertilizer, and actively resisted various natural disasters. The unit yield of rapeseed in these areas has increased several times compared to the past, and some large-area yields have caught up with rice and corn. Last year, Sichuan Province had more than 1,000 mu of rapeseed with a yield of over 600 jin per mu. The emergence of a large number of "Rapeseed Kings" in various places shows that rapeseed is not a low-yielding crop and can achieve very high yields. The 900,000 "Rapeseed King" plants planted in Zhong County, Sichuan Province, last year achieved an average yield of 4 liang per plant, of which 493 plants achieved a yield of over 3 jin. Originally, the so-called high yield and low yield are not absolute. Low yield in the past can become high yield now, and can become even higher yield in the future. The key lies in whether we can continuously and conscientiously summarize experience, discover and master the objective laws of rapeseed yield increase, and take various effective yield increase measures to promote it from low yield to high yield, and from high yield to even higher yield.

The low return on rapeseed cultivation is another ideological problem that must be solved. It is precisely because of the rough cultivation, insufficient fertilizer, and very low yields in the past that the returns were naturally not high. The same is true for other crops. However, when the yield increases, the returns will increase greatly. The increased income from rapeseed cultivation by the Minsheng Production Team of the Hengqi People's Commune in Huangpi County, Hubei Province, is an example. This production team adopted measures such as timely early sowing and transplanting, reasonable close planting, and strengthening field management. In 1959, the average yield of 1,200 mu of rapeseed (of which 500 mu were originally wasteland) was more than 139.1 jin per mu, and the income from rapeseed oil alone was 24.16 yuan per mu, which was no lower than the local wheat. In 1959, the average yield of rapeseed planted in Shanghai County, Shanghai City, was 235 jin per mu, and the income per mu was more than 40 yuan, exceeding the income of other winter crops. At the same time, the income from rapeseed should not be calculated solely from the amount of rapeseed harvested. Rapeseed stalks and pods are good feed for pigs. Planting rapeseed can make full use of the land, and can also increase one season's harvest without affecting the production of early rice or middle rice.

The socialist economy is a planned economy developed in proportion. We must not only have enough grain, but also have enough oil and other cash crops. In the past, we used the greatest efforts to develop grain production, and also made certain efforts in oil production. Now, after achieving the great achievements of two consecutive Great Leap Forwards in agricultural production, in addition to continuing to place grain production in the primary position, we must further strive to increase the production of oil and other cash crops even more. This is the objective need of national economic development. Precisely because of this, in the agricultural field, the Party Central Committee has put forward the policy of taking grain as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward. All people's communes and production teams should resolutely implement this policy, and while striving to develop grain production, they should also strive to develop oil production. In this regard, we must never one-sidedly calculate economic accounts, but should adhere to putting politics in command. We must treat the issue of oil production increase with high political enthusiasm, and recognize that increasing oil production is a major contribution to socialism.

The key to striving for a bumper rapeseed harvest at present is to strengthen field management. Currently, it is the bolting period of rapeseed, which is a critical period for determining more branching and more pod setting. There must be sufficient nutrients to meet the needs of its rapid growth and development. The experience of high yields last year proved that those who seized the bolting period to apply top dressing achieved significant results. According to a survey in Songzi County, Hubei Province, rapeseed that received top dressing during the bolting period increased production by 29.1% compared to those that did not receive top dressing. According to the results of a three-year fertilization experiment conducted by the Hunan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, top dressing during the bolting period of sweet rapeseed increased production by 62% compared to no top dressing, and top dressing during the bolting period of Victory rapeseed increased production by 41% to 91%. This shows how important it is to focus on top dressing and other field management during the rapeseed bolting period. During the rapeseed bolting period, in addition to focusing on top dressing, it is also necessary to carry out management tasks such as intertillage and weeding, clearing ditches for drainage, and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests.

The sowing and seedling management of rapeseed this year is better than in any previous year, but the growth of rapeseed in various regions is not balanced enough. It is understood that third-class seedlings generally account for 10%-15%, and in some places the proportion of third-class seedlings is even higher. The effective way to eliminate third-class seedlings at this stage is to apply top dressing during the bolting period as early as possible and focus on bolting period management. Last year, a plot of rapeseed in Lingxi People's Commune, Cili County, Hunan Province, originally grew very poorly, but after applying fertilizer three times in a row after the beginning of spring, applying 83 jin of rapeseed cake, 18 jin of ammonium sulfate, and 170 jin of manure per mu, it achieved a high yield of 447 jin of rapeseed per mu. This shows that some third-class seedlings are not terrible. As long as the leadership attaches importance to rapeseed production, seizes the opportunity to organize forces, takes measures, and strengthens management, third-class seedlings can be eliminated and rapeseed production can be greatly increased. Therefore, people's communes and production teams in various regions must manage all the rapeseed planted, without leaving out a single plot. Field management should also be strengthened on rapeseed fields that are not growing well, and fertilizer should be applied to strive for increased production. Do not plow them under casually. The slogan of "guaranteeing planting and guaranteeing harvest" recently put forward by some regions in Hunan and Jiangxi is very good. We must not only manage the high-yield rapeseed fields with large areas, but also manage the general fields, so that less planting and more harvesting are combined with more planting and more harvesting, so as to achieve a comprehensive and bumper rapeseed harvest. Plant one mu, harvest one mu. Not only must we manage all of them, but we must also manage them to the end, and take corresponding measures according to the different growth stages of rapeseed, grasping each link tightly.

Rapeseed has a long growing period, and management work is relatively meticulous. The leadership work must adapt to this situation, and persistently, deeply, and specifically pay attention to studying the problems in field management, and mobilize the masses to solve them in a timely manner. What needs to be seriously resolved here is the rational arrangement of labor, the establishment of field management professional teams, the promotion of advanced experience, and the improvement of cultivation techniques. Leading cadres must effectively participate in production, plant experimental fields and large-area command fields, be familiar with every link of rapeseed production, summarize experience, guide comprehensively, promote the improvement of rapeseed cultivation techniques, and launch a high tide of increasing rapeseed production by "learning from Rapeseed Kings" and "catching up with Rapeseed Kings."

    争取油菜大丰收
    油料是人民生活中必需的副食品原料，也是国家经济建设中不可缺少的物资。人民生活和国家经济建设对于油料的需要正在迅速地增长，要求在高速度增产粮食的同时，加快油料增产的速度。在油料中油菜占重要地位。油菜的播种面积历年都占全国除大豆以外的全部油料作物面积的30％以上，每年菜籽实际产油量占花生、油菜、芝麻三种主要油料作物实际产油量总和的35％—40％左右。菜籽油是长江流域人民的主要食用油；菜籽油饼是肥效较高的肥料。现在各地正在大力发展养猪业，而油菜的荚壳和秸秆就是猪的好饲料。据分析，油菜秆和荚壳制成的饲料，一公斤中含有粗蛋白质十四克，比青饲料中比较好的水浮莲的蛋白质含量还多三克左右，并且还含有较多的脂肪。湖南平江县农民这样称赞增产油菜的好处：“油菜打菜籽，有钱又有油，荚壳当饲料，肥料不用愁，一举共三得，一丘当三丘。”
    但是要发展油菜生产，争取油菜大丰收，还需要解决以下几个认识问题。
    油菜究竟是不是低产作物？这是必须首先弄清楚的一个问题。在过去，有不少人只看到油菜产量不高，就把它当做是低产作物。其实，过去油菜产量不高，主要是由于农民的力量还没有充分地组织起来，发挥最大的作用。当时只能集中解决粮食生产，不可能在油菜以及其他作物上投入更大的力量，因而也就不去精耕细作，甚至抱着“有就收，没有就丢”的态度。这样，油菜产量怎么能够提高呢？1958年大跃进和人民公社成立以来，依靠人民公社强大的组织力量，很多地方改变了落后的耕作习惯，实行精耕细作，增施了足够的肥料，积极抗御各种自然灾害，这些地区的油菜单位产量比过去成倍地上升，而且有一部分大面积产量赶上了水稻、玉米。去年四川省油菜亩产六百斤以上的就有一千多亩。各地大批“油菜王”的出现，说明了油菜不是低产作物，完全可以获得很高的产量。四川忠县去年种植的九十万株“油菜王”，平均株产达到四两，其中有四百九十三株株产达到三斤以上。本来，所谓高产和低产都不是绝对的。过去低产，现在可以高产，将来还可以更高产。关键在于我们能不能不断地认真地总结经验，发现和掌握油菜增产的客观规律，采取各种有效的增产措施，促使它从低产变高产，高产更高产。
    种油菜收益不多，这是又一个必须解决的思想问题。正是因为过去耕作粗糙，肥料不足，产量很低，当然，收益是不会多的。其他作物又何尝不是如此。但是产量提高以后，收益就会大大增加。湖北黄陂县横启人民公社民生生产队种油菜增加收入就是一个例子。这个生产队由于采取适时早播早栽、合理密植、加强田间管理等措施，1959年一千二百亩油菜（其中五百亩原来是荒地）平均每亩产菜籽一百三十九斤一两多，单是菜油收入每亩就有二十四元一角六分，收益并不比当地小麦低。上海市上海县1959年种植的油菜全县平均亩产二百三十五斤，每亩收益在四十元以上，超过了其他越冬作物的收益。同时，油菜收益多少，也不能单从油菜籽收获多少来计算。菜秆、菜荚壳是猪的好饲料。种油菜可以充分利用土地，在不影响早稻或中稻生产的情况下，还可以增加一季收成。
    社会主义经济是按比例发展的计划经济。我们不但要有足够的粮食，而且应当有足够的油料和其他经济作物。在过去，我们曾用最大的力量去发展粮食生产，也在油料生产上作了一定的努力。现在，在取得了两年农业生产的连续大跃进的伟大成就以后，除了继续把粮食生产放在首要地位以外，还要进一步努力去争取油料等经济作物更多地增产。这是国民经济发展的客观需要。正因为如此，在农业方面，党中央提出了以粮为纲，全面跃进的方针。各个人民公社、生产队应该坚决执行这个方针，在努力发展粮食生产的同时，也要努力发展油料生产。在这方面决不应该片面地算经济账，而应该坚持政治挂帅。要以高度的政治热情对待油料增产问题，要认清增产油料是对社会主义的重大贡献。
    当前争取油菜大丰收的关键，是加强田间管理。目前正是油菜抽苔期，这是决定油菜多分枝、多结荚的关键时期。要有充足的养料，才能满足它迅速生长发育的需要。去年的丰产经验证明，凡是抓住苔期追肥的，都获得了显著的效果。湖北省松滋县调查，油菜苔期追肥的比不追肥的增产29．1％。据湖南省农业科学研究所进行三年施肥试验的结果，甜油菜苔期追肥的较不追肥的增产62％，胜利油菜苔期追肥的增产41％到91％。由此可见，在油菜抽苔时期大抓追肥等项田间管理是多么重要。在油菜抽苔时期，除了大抓追肥以外，还需要做中耕除草、清沟排渍和防治病虫害等项管理工作。
    今年的油菜播种和苗期管理比以往任何一年都好，但是各地油菜生长情况还不够平衡。据了解，三类苗一般占10％—15％，有的地方三类苗比重还要更大些。消灭三类苗的有效办法，在现阶段就是早施苔期追肥，大抓苔期管理。去年湖南省慈利县零溪人民公社有一丘油菜，原来长得很不好，在开春后连追了三次肥料，每亩施菜枯八十三斤、硫酸铵十八斤、大粪一百七十斤，结果获得了每亩产菜籽四百四十七斤的丰产成绩。这说明，有一部分三类苗并不可怕，只要领导思想重视油菜生产，抓紧时机组织力量，采取措施，加强管理，三类苗就一定能消灭，油菜产量就一定能大大增加。因此，各地人民公社、生产队一定要把所有种植的油菜都管起来，不让一块遗漏，生长不够好的菜田也要抓紧田间管理，追施肥料，争取增产，不要随便犁掉。最近湖南、江西一些地区提出的“保种保收”的口号很好。既要管好大面积的油菜高产田，又要管好一般田，使少种多收和多种多收相结合，作到油菜全面大丰收。种一亩，收一亩，不但要管得全，而且要管到底，要按照油菜的不同生长阶段采取相应措施，环环抓紧。
    油菜生长期长，而管理工作又比较细致，领导工作必须适应这一情况，持久、深入而具体地注意研究田间管理中的问题，发动群众及时解决。这里特别需要认真解决的是合理安排劳力、建立田间管理专业队、推广先进经验和改进栽培技术等问题。领导干部必须切实参加生产，种试验田和大面积指挥田，熟悉油菜生产的每一环节，总结经验，指导全面，推动油菜栽培技术的改进，掀起一个“学油菜王”、“赶油菜王”的增产油菜的热潮。
