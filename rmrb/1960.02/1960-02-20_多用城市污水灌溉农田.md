    Use Urban Sewage to Irrigate Farmland More
    Using urban sewage for irrigation is a problem worth taking seriously. Among the existing fifty-plus cities in China with sewer systems longer than thirty kilometers, there is a population of approximately one hundred million people. Assuming each person discharges an average of thirty liters of sewage per day, the annual volume of domestic sewage amounts to 1.1 billion cubic meters (not including industrial wastewater), equivalent to the capacity of fifteen Ming Tombs Reservoirs. If we assume an average nitrogen content of 50 milligrams per liter of sewage (the nitrogen content of general urban sewage ranges from 30 to 120 milligrams per liter), the total sewage contains 55,000 tons of nitrogen annually, equivalent to 275,000 tons of ammonium sulfate fertilizer.
    The organized use of urban sewage for irrigation in China is relatively recent. However, thanks to the leadership of the Party and the welcome of the peasant masses, this work has developed rapidly in a short two years. The irrigated area has grown from 5,000 mu in 1957 to over 1 million mu in 1959. However, only about one-tenth of the available urban sewage is being utilized, so there is still great potential.
    Irrigating farmland with sewage not only moistens the soil but also provides it with rich organic fertilizer. The organic matter in sewage, through the action of soil microorganisms, decomposes and provides the nitrogen fertilizer needed by crops, as well as producing large amounts of carbon dioxide and various organic and inorganic acids. Carbon dioxide can be directly absorbed by plant roots and leaves, while organic and inorganic acids can promote the dissolution of minerals in the soil, thereby increasing the nutrients in the soil. The decomposition of organic matter also increases the humus content of the soil, promoting the formation of soil aggregates and increasing the soil's water retention capacity.
    Since organic matter and humus molecules in sewage contain chromophores, they darken the soil color and enhance its heat absorption. On the other hand, the increased proportion of organic matter and humus in the soil reduces the soil's specific heat and weakens heat transfer, promoting the decomposition and dissolution of salts and organic matter in the soil, and enhancing the ability of plant roots to absorb nutrients.
    Over the past few years, facts in various places have proven that areas using sewage for irrigation have generally achieved high yields. For example, the Huaidi Production Team of the Chang'an People's Commune in Shijiazhuang City, irrigated 1,800 mu of wheat with sewage, achieving an average yield of 531.38 jin per mu, and even had 2.3 mu of high-yield fields with a yield of 1,238.4 jin per mu. In contrast, fields irrigated with clear water yielded only 408 jin per mu on average. Another example is the scallions irrigated with sewage by the Daishan Commune in Wuhan City, which yielded 10,000 jin per mu. The chili peppers irrigated with sewage by the Electrical Appliance Commune in Harbin City yielded 19,000 jin per mu, celery 20,000 jin, and cucumbers 15,000 jin, all much higher than the yields of ordinary land.
    In addition, many places have used sewage to grow lotus roots, cultivate fish fry, raise water hyacinths, and cultivate kelp, all of which have yielded good results. As the peasants say, "Urban sewage is as valuable as oil, guaranteeing a good harvest without rain or fertilizer."
    In theory, the use of urban sewage can continuously improve soil fertility, and in practice, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries have all achieved high yields. Fully utilizing urban sewage for irrigation can also save on urban construction investment, purify sewage, and improve environmental hygiene. The comprehensive utilization of sludge is even more promising (it can be used to produce biogas, extract vitamin B12 and antibiotics, etc.). Therefore, utilizing urban sewage to transform negative and harmful factors into positive and beneficial ones fully conforms to the spirit of the General Line. I suggest that cities and suburban people's communes with the conditions fully utilize sewage for irrigation.

### 多用城市污水灌溉农田

    多用城市污水灌溉农田
    利用城市污水灌溉是值得重视的问题。我国现有下水道在三十公里以上的五十多个城市中，约有一亿人口，每人每日排出污水量按平均三十升计，全年就有生活污水十一亿方（工业废水还不在内），相当于十五个十三陵水库的容量。如以污水中平均含氮量为五十毫克／升计算（一般城市污水含氮量在三十到一百二十毫克／升之间），每年全部污水中就有氮素五万五千吨，相当硫铵化肥二十七万五千吨。
    我国有组织地利用城市污水灌溉农田的时间较短。但是，由于党的领导和农民群众的欢迎，在短短两年间，这个工作得到了飞跃的发展，灌溉面积已从1957年的五千亩，发展到1959年的一百余万亩。可是利用的城市污水不过十分之一左右，潜力仍是很大的。
    污水灌溉农田，不但能浸润土壤，并且能给土壤输入丰富的有机肥料。污水中的有机物经过土壤微生物的作用，引起分解，除能供给作物所需的氮肥外，还能产生大量的二氧化碳和各种有机酸与无机酸。二氧化碳可直接供植物根叶吸收，而有机酸和无机酸能促进土壤中矿物质的溶解，转而增加土壤的养料。有机质的分解又增加了土壤腐植质含量，促进了土壤团粒的形成，增加了土壤的保水蓄水能力。
    由于污水中有机质和腐植质分子含有载色体，使土壤颜色变深，增强土壤的吸热性；另一方面，土壤中有机质和腐植质比例增加，又使土壤比热减小，传热减弱，促进土壤中盐类和有机质的分解和溶解，增强植物根系吸收养料的作用。
    几年来各地事实证明，利用污水灌溉的地区，普遍得到高额丰收。如：石家庄市长安人民公社槐底生产队，利用污水灌溉的一千八百亩小麦，平均亩产达五百三十一点三八斤，并且出现了高额丰产田二点三亩，亩产达到一千二百三十八点四斤。而清水灌溉的平均每亩只产四百零八斤。又如武汉市岱山公社污水灌溉的大葱亩产达一万斤。哈尔滨市电器公社污水灌溉的辣椒亩产一万九千斤，芹菜二万斤，黄瓜一万五千斤，都比一般地的产量高了许多。
    此外，许多地方利用污水种藕，培养鱼苗、水浮莲，养殖海带，都收到了很好的效益。真如农民所说“城市污水贵似油，无雨无肥保丰收”。
    城市污水的利用，从理论上说能持续地提高土壤的肥力，实践中农、林、牧、副、渔普遍得到高额丰收。而充分利用城市污水灌溉，还可以节省城市建设投资，净化污水，改善环境卫生；污泥的综合利用更大有前途（能制取沼气，提取维生素12和抗生素等）。由此可见，利用城市污水，变消极有害的因素为积极有利的因素，完全符合总路线的精神。我建议有条件的城市和郊区人民公社，充分利用污水灌溉农田。
