Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The light industry systems in the Northeast, North China, Northwest, and East China regions, promoting the spirit of communist cooperation, have launched mutual adjustment and support for raw materials, equipment, and other materials between regions and factories. This organized new method of sharing resources and opening up raw material sources has played an important role in solving the current urgent supply of raw materials and equipment problems in production.

The light industry sectors of ten provinces and cities in the North China and Northwest regions recently jointly convened a material adjustment conference in Xi'an. The North China provinces and municipalities, with their relatively developed light industry, currently have a larger production potential, but feel that the supply of raw materials is still insufficient. The Northwest provinces, with their relatively abundant raw materials, have not been able to fully utilize their materials due to the relative scarcity of equipment. Based on this situation, at this material adjustment conference, the Northwest provinces transferred a large amount of raw materials such as leather, soda ash, tannin extract, and gypsum to support North China and Beijing; North China and Beijing transferred many items such as iron shovels, mattocks, electric motors, refined starch equipment, and handcarts to support the Northwest. The two regions exchanged and adjusted tens of millions of pieces of various materials, including raw materials, machinery, and power equipment. The light industry system in the Northeast region has already organized two material adjustment efforts. The first was the material adjustment between the four factories directly under the Ministry of Light Industry: Liaoyang Paperboard Factory, Shenyang Copper Mesh Factory, Jiamusi Paper Mill, and Kaishantun Paper Mill, which solved many urgently needed material supply problems in production. Based on the successful experience of these four factories, the Northeast organized a larger-scale material adjustment effort involving three provinces and cities, as well as key factories. The participating units jointly signed a large number of material adjustment contracts and agreements. 90% of these contracts and agreements have already been fulfilled. Shanghai and the six provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Shandong have also carried out material exchange and adjustment work in various forms and flexible methods. The provinces reached agreements to exchange 71 kinds of raw materials such as chemical raw materials, wild plants, and agricultural and sideline products.

In carrying out material adjustment, each region and factory has adhered to the spirit of selflessness and giving priority to others, unconditionally supporting fraternal provinces or other factories with raw materials and equipment that they do not urgently need. The Beijing Light Industry Department, with its relatively sufficient equipment, unreservedly handed over all of its assets, transferring surplus tools, machinery and equipment, and handcarts to support the Northwest region. Xinjiang, which lacks industrial equipment and raw materials, only transferred 100 kilograms of horsetail hair in this exchange, but received 18 kinds of machinery and equipment, asphalt, and other materials that were dozens of times more valuable than the horsetail hair. The Jiamusi Paper Mill took the initiative to transfer four tons of transformer oil that it had stored to support the Kaishantun Paper Mill, which urgently needed it. The Shenyang Copper Mesh Factory heard that the Kaishantun Paper Mill was short of tungsten, and although it considered that it was not well-off itself, it still adhered to the spirit of putting others first and transferred 100 kilograms of tungsten.

Many factories, through material adjustment, have found important raw materials or equipment urgently needed in current production, solved key production problems, and greatly promoted the production of light industry. A relatively small paper mill in Ningxia had all the conditions in place, but could not produce due to the lack of an engine. At the material adjustment conference, this factory found a suitable electric motor, installed it, and immediately put it into production. Gansu Province, in the adjusted materials, received 580 large iron pots, which solved the problem of the urgent need for large iron pots for the masses to produce native paper pulp. Beijing, which lacked sulfuric acid jars, also transferred 10,000 sulfuric acid jars from Shanxi.

    轻工业系统展开地区、厂际之间大协作
    无条件地尽先支援别人
    东北、华北、西北、华东地区互相调剂原料和设备
    新华社19日讯　东北、华北、西北、华东地区的轻工业系统，发扬共产主义协作精神，展开了地区之间、厂际之间的原料和设备等物资的互相调剂互相支援工作。这种有组织的互通有无的开辟原料来源的新办法，对于解决当前生产上急需的原料供应和设备问题，起了重要作用。
    华北和西北两个地区的十个省市的各轻工业行业，不久前在西安联合召开了物资调剂会议。轻工业比较发达的华北各省和北京市，目前生产潜力比较大，感到原料供应尚不充足，原料比较充足的西北各省，因为目前设备比较少，物资还没有得到充分利用。根据这个情况，在这次物资调剂会议上，西北各省调出了大量的皮革、土碱、栲胶、石膏等原料支援华北和北京；华北和北京调出许多铁锹、洋镐、电动机、精制淀粉设备、手推车等物资支援西北。两个地区互相交流和调剂的原料、机械、动力设备等各种物资达上千万件。东北地区轻工业系统已经组织了两次物资调剂工作。第一次是轻工业部直属的辽阳纸板厂、沈阳铜网厂、佳木斯造纸厂和开山屯造纸厂四个厂之间的物资调剂，解决了不少生产急需的物资供应问题。根据这四个厂的成功经验，东北又组织了一次规模更大的，有三个省和市以及重点工厂参加的物资调剂工作。参加会议的各单位共同签订了大量调剂物资的合同和协议。这些合同和协议已有90％实现。上海和江苏、浙江、福建、安徽、江西、山东六个省，也以多种形式和灵活的方法，开展了物资交流和调剂工作。各省之间达成了交流化工原料、野生植物、农副产品等七十一种原料的协议。
    各地区各厂之间在进行物资调剂时，都本着克己为人的精神，把自己不急需的原料和设备，无条件地尽先支援兄弟省或其他工厂。器材比较充分的北京轻工业部门，无保留地把自己全部家底交出来，调出了有余的工具、机器设备和手推车等物资支援西北地区。工业设备和工业原料比较缺乏的新疆在这次交流中虽然只调出了一百公斤马尾，却得到了十八种机器设备、沥青等较马尾的价值大几十倍的物资。佳木斯造纸厂主动把自己保存的四吨变压器油，调出支援急用的开山屯造纸厂。沈阳铜网厂听到开山屯造纸厂缺少钨金，虽然考虑到自己也不宽裕，仍然本着先人后己的精神，调出了一百公斤钨金。
    许多工厂通过物资调剂工作，找到了当前生产中急需的重要原料或设备，解决了生产关键问题，大大促进了轻工业的生产。宁夏有个比较小的造纸厂，一切条件都已具备，只差一个发动机，不能生产。在物资调剂会议上，这个厂找到了一个合适的电动机，拿回去安装以后，立刻投入了生产。甘肃省在调剂的物资中，调到了五百八十个大铁锅，解决了群众大搞土纸浆急需大铁锅的问题。缺乏硫酸坛的北京市，也从山西调到了一万个硫酸坛。
