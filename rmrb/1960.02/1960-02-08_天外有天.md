Title: There's Always a Higher Heaven

Shanghai's light industrial products have long enjoyed a high reputation and have always been a benchmark for counterparts in various regions. More than a year ago, when local light industry experienced significant development, various regions sent people to Shanghai to learn from their experience, declaring they would "catch up with Shanghai." At that time, some comrades were worried: with the rapid development of local light industry and the quality catching up with Shanghai, wouldn't Shanghai's light industrial products become heavily stockpiled?

Now it seems that this worry is just like the old saying: "borrowing trouble." The vigorous development of local light industry and catching up with Shanghai has not only failed to affect the development of Shanghai's light industry, but has also propelled Shanghai's light industry to advance at a faster pace towards the production of high-grade precision products. In just over a year, "blank spots" in light industry such as watches, cameras, film, and optical glass have been filled, and a large number of high-end products have emerged among products such as fountain pens, bicycles, and sewing machines. The reputation of Shanghai's light industrial products is even higher, and a broader world is unfolding before Shanghai's light industrial departments.

This development of Shanghai's light industry is by no means an accident. Mountains have peaks, and the sea has a bottom, but the development of production is endless. Output can be higher, quality can be better, and varieties can be more numerous. Especially in a country like ours where industry is still relatively backward, there are still many "blank spots" in the industrial field, and the scope for development is even broader. It's just that some people see this broad world, and therefore feel refreshed and motivated, constantly boosting their energy and striving for the top; some people do not see this broad world, and therefore are narrow-minded and full of worries, either being in the lower reaches, afraid to advance, or, although being in the upper reaches, not thinking of progress, eventually drifting to the lower reaches.

The torrent of life rolls forward, and tens of thousands of new things demand that people express their attitude. What should the master do when the apprentice catches up? This problem has long been solved. Colleagues are not enemies, help each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, and improve together. This problem has also been solved. A large number of new industrial cities have emerged. Places that originally used "Shanghai goods," "Tianjin goods," or "Guangzhou goods" now have "local goods." What should the old industrial bases do? This is still a new problem that has emerged in the context of the Great Leap Forward. Shanghai was the first to encounter this problem and solved it well. That is: helping others with full enthusiasm, opening up new worlds for oneself, and developing towards the production of high-grade precision products. It seems that this path has universal significance. All old industrial bases must help new industrial cities, industries in large cities must help industries in small and medium-sized cities, and industries in small and medium-sized cities must help commune industries. In this kind of assistance, the old industrial bases, the industries in large cities, and the industries in small and medium-sized cities do not stop developing, but develop towards higher directions. This "higher level" of industrial production at all levels is urgently needed to realize industrial modernization.

Of course, to produce at a "higher level," one must first think at a "higher level."

    天外有天

    上海的轻工业产品久负盛誉，一直是各地同行的标兵。一年多以前，当地方轻工业有了很大发展的时候，各地也是纷纷派人到上海去取经，申言要“赶上上海”。当时，有些同志曾经担心：各地的轻工业发展得这样快，质量又赶上海，上海的轻工业产品岂不是要大量积压吗？
    现在看来，这种担心正应上一句老话：“杞人忧天”。地方轻工业的蓬勃发展和赶上上海，非但没有影响上海轻工业的发展，而且推动了上海的轻工业用更快的速度向生产高级精密产品的方向前进。时间不过一年多，手表、照相机、胶卷、光学玻璃等等轻工业中的“空白点”被补上了，金笔、自行车、缝纫机等等产品中又出现了大批的高档货。上海轻工业产品的信誉更高了，展开在上海轻工业部门面前的，是一个更加广阔的天地。
    上海轻工业的这种发展，完全不是什么意外的事情。山高有顶，海深有底，生产的发展却是没有止境的。产量高了可以更高，质量好了可以更好，品种多了可以更多。特别是像我们这样一个工业还很落后的国家，工业的领域中还有许多“空白点”，发展的天地更是广阔得很。只是有些人看到了这广阔的天地，因而心旷神怡，不断地鼓足干劲，力争上游；有些人看不到这广阔的天地，因而心胸狭窄，顾虑多端，或则处于下游，怯于上进，或则虽居于上游，不思进展，终致淌到下游中来。
    生活的激流滚滚前进，成千累万的新鲜事物要求人们表示态度。徒弟赶上师傅，师傅怎么办？这问题早就解决了。同行不是冤家，互相帮助，取长补短，共同提高，这问题也已经解决了。新的工业城市大批诞生，本来用“上海货”、用“天津货”、用“广州货”的地方，现在有“本地货”了，老的工业基地怎么办？这还是大跃进的形势中出现的新问题。上海接触这个问题最早，解决得也好。这就是：满腔热情地帮助别人，自己开辟新的天地，朝生产高级精密产品的方向发展。看来，这条道路很有普遍意义。一切老工业基地都要帮助新工业城市，大城市的工业都要帮助中小城市的工业，中小城市的工业都要帮助公社工业。在这种帮助中，老工业基地、大城市的工业和中小城市的工业都不是停止发展了，而是朝更高的方向发展了。这种各级工业生产的“更上一层楼”，是实现工业现代化所迫切需要的。
    当然，要生产“更上一层楼”，首先要思想“更上一层楼”。
