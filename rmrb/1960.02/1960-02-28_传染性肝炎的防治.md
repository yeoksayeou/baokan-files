    Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Hepatitis
    Fu Lianzhang
    Infectious hepatitis is a global epidemic that has occurred and spread in various countries for a long time. Since World War II, the number of cases of this disease has increased in various places. Recently, more cases of this disease have also been found in some parts of our country. Due to a lack of correct understanding of this disease, people who contract it often fear that it will turn into a chronic condition or cirrhosis, and lack confidence in striving for a cure. And some people who have not contracted this disease are afraid of contracting hepatitis everywhere. Obviously, these are not correct attitudes towards the disease.
    Infectious hepatitis is a systemic infectious disease caused by a "virus." Various organs in the human body will be damaged to varying degrees, especially the liver, which will cause functional disorders due to inflammatory lesions, thus bringing a series of clinical symptoms. Some patients develop jaundice, where the skin and eyeballs turn yellow, which is medically called jaundice. Others do not have jaundice (in general, hepatitis without jaundice is milder than the jaundice type). People infected with this disease generally experience fever, extreme fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation. At the same time, they may feel upper abdominal distension and discomfort or pain in the right upper abdomen (liver area) and other gastrointestinal symptoms, and sometimes also have respiratory symptoms such as cough and runny nose. Medical examinations will reveal liver enlargement and abnormal liver function tests. After a certain period of recuperation and necessary medication, these symptoms gradually disappear, and the size of the liver and liver function tests return to normal. The course of the disease is generally about three to four weeks, but can be extended to several months. Patients with infectious hepatitis, if they can have good rest and appropriate treatment, can mostly recover to health. Only a very few develop into chronic conditions, and progression to cirrhosis is even rarer.
    How does one contract infectious hepatitis? It is mainly caused by people coming into contact with or eating water, food, utensils, etc. that have been contaminated by the patient's feces. Flies also play a role in this. Secondly, it is due to the transfusion of blood products such as blood or dried plasma that carry the virus, or the use of syringes, etc., that have been contaminated by the virus and not thoroughly disinfected. Therefore, the prevention of infectious hepatitis, like other infectious diseases, mainly involves strictly controlling the source of infection, cutting off the route of transmission, and enhancing the body's resistance.
    From the perspective of a collective unit, attention should be paid to the early detection of patients, strengthening the management of patients, and implementing isolation for a certain period of time when necessary. Strictly ensure the hygiene of canteens and the cleanliness of toilets. Food handlers, supply administrators, restaurants, and other personnel who come into contact with the public's food should undergo regular physical examinations and strengthen their health education. In medical departments, strict disinfection of syringes, etc., must be carried out, and caution should be exercised when selecting blood donors.
    From an individual perspective, the main thing is to ensure food hygiene and pay attention to personal hygiene, such as not drinking raw water and strictly washing hands after defecation and before meals. Disinfect tableware and strictly implement the use of serving chopsticks. Utensils, items, and children's toys that patients have come into contact with should be strictly disinfected. At the same time, eliminate flies and mosquitoes and other disease vectors.
    Enhancing people's physique is also very important and has positive significance for preventing infectious hepatitis. From the perspective of the conditions for the onset of infectious diseases, the body's reactivity is one of the important conditions. When pathogens enter the human body, different people may experience different situations: either illness or no illness; even if illness occurs, the clinical condition and the length of the course of the disease are not consistent, which is related to the different reactivity of the body. The body's reactivity is closely related to the person's current physiological state, mental state, defense function, secretion function, excretion function, nutritional status, etc., that is, it is closely related to the body's health status. Therefore, in our daily life, we must keep the body in a healthy and vigorous state, strengthen regular physical exercise, participate more in physical labor, and maintain good living habits. This will help us overcome all pathogens that harm the body.
    What should you do if you contract infectious hepatitis? You should actively receive treatment and take necessary rest under the guidance of a doctor, but more importantly, you must maintain a revolutionary optimistic spirit and have the courage to fight the disease. People's mental factors, that is, the state of activity of the cerebral cortex, are extremely closely related to the human body. Mental pleasure and open-mindedness will help the body be in a positive and vigorous state, thereby helping to fight the disease, which is helpful for treatment.
    Infectious hepatitis can be completely prevented and treated. Even if you need a long period of recuperation after contracting this disease, it can still be cured. However, this disease often occurs in some collective units, especially among children and young adults, and can also cause epidemics. Therefore, we must pay attention to doing a good job in the prevention and treatment of this disease.

    传染性肝炎的防治
    傅连暲
    传染性肝炎是一种世界性的流行病，长期以来，各国都有发生和流行。第二次世界大战以后，这病在各地的发病数有了增加。近来我国部分地区也较多地发现了这种病例。由于对这种疾病缺乏正确的认识，得了这种疾病的人常怕转为慢性，怕肝硬化，对争取痊愈缺乏信心。而有些没有患这种病的人，就处处害怕传染上肝炎。显然，这都不是正确的对待疾病的态度。
    传染性肝炎是一种由“病毒”引起的全身性的传染病，人体内的各个器官都会受到不同程度的损害，其中特别对于肝脏会由于炎症病变而引起功能上的障碍，因此而带来一系列的临床症状。病人中有些人的皮肤和眼球出现黄色，即医学上称为黄疸，另一种则没有黄疸的现象（没有黄疸的肝炎，总的来说，是比黄疸型为轻的）。感染了这种疾病的人，一般都有发热、极度疲倦、食欲不振、恶心、呕吐、腹泻或便秘等现象，同时会感到上腹胀和右上腹部（肝脏部位）不适或疼痛等胃肠道症状，有时也会有咳嗽、流涕等呼吸道的症状。在医学检查上会发现有肝脏肿大，肝功能试验不正常等。经过了一定时期的调养和必要的药物治疗以后，这些症状就逐渐地消失，肝脏的大小和肝功能试验恢复到正常。病程一般约为三至四星期，也有延至数月的。患传染性肝炎的病人，如果能很好休养和适当治疗，绝大多数能恢复健康。转为慢性者只是极少数，而发展到肝硬变则更是极个别的病例。
    怎样会染上传染性肝炎的呢？主要是人们接触了或吃了经过病人大便污染了的水、食物、用具等而引起的，苍蝇在其中也起媒介的作用。其次，是由于输入了带有病毒的血液或干血浆等血制品，或是使用经过了病毒污染而没有彻底消毒的注射器等。所以传染性肝炎的预防，和其他的传染病一样，主要也是：严格控制传染源，切断传染途径和增强身体抵抗力。
    从一个集体单位说，就要注意早期发现患者，加强对病人的管理，必要时作一定时间的隔离。要严格做好食堂卫生工作和厕所的清洁卫生工作。对炊事员、供应管理员、饮食店等与群众食物有接触的工作人员，要进行定期的体格检查和加强对他们的卫生宣教工作。在医疗部门中，对于注射器等必须严格做好消毒工作，在选择供血者时应慎重。
    从个人来说，主要就是要搞好饮食卫生和讲究个人卫生，如不喝生水，严格做到便后和饭前洗手。做好食具消毒，严格执行使用公筷制度。病人接触过的用具、物品，小孩的玩具等要注意严格的消毒。同时还要扑灭蝇蚊等病媒。
  增强人们的体质，对预防传染性肝炎也同样地十分重要而有积极的意义。从传染病的发病条件来说，机体反应性是其中重要的条件之一。当病原体进入人体后，不同人可以有不同的情况：或发病或不发病；即发病时，所表现的临床病情及病程的长短也不一致，这与机体的反应性不同有关。而机体反应性是与人体当时的生理状态、精神状态、防御机能、分泌机能、排泄机能、营养状态等有密切关系，也就是说与机体的健康状态有密切的关系。所以我们在日常生活中就必须使机体保持着一种健康旺盛的状态，要加强经常的身体锻炼，多参加体力劳动，保持良好的生活习惯，这将会帮助我们战胜一切病原体对身体的侵害。
    患上了传染性肝炎怎么办？应该在医师的指导下积极地进行治疗和必要的休息，但更重要的是要保持革命的乐观主义精神，要有与疾病作斗争的勇气。人们的精神因素，也就是说大脑皮层的活动状态，与人的机体有极其密切的关系，精神愉快、思想开朗将有利于机体处于积极的旺盛的状态，从而有利于与疾病作斗争，这对于治疗来说是不无帮助的。
    传染性肝炎是完全可以防治的，即使患了这个病后需要较长时间的疗养，但仍然是可以痊愈的。不过这疾病多在一些集体单位，特别是多在儿童和青壮年中发生，还会引起流行，因此我们必须重视做好对这疾病的防治工作。
