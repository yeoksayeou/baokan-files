    Do a Good Job in Spring Hygiene Work
    The first spring of the 1960s has arrived. The people of the whole country are announcing with joy and excitement that they have completed the main targets of the Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. This year, the people of the whole country eagerly hope to use their own hands to make even more amazing achievements, so that 1960 will see a better and more comprehensive leap forward. To ensure that this wish becomes a reality, grasping hygiene work, so that every worker is strong and vigorous in labor, is an important link in all tasks.
    Hygiene work, like other work, must be seen far ahead and grasped early. Spring has arrived, and many factories and mines and water conservancy construction sites are beginning to prepare to remove cold-proof equipment, and many people are also beginning to reduce their clothing. However, the spring climate is changeable, and it is easy to develop colds and flu and other respiratory infectious diseases. According to meteorological forecasts, many places will be attacked by a large cold wave in the middle of this month, and the climate will suddenly become cold and hot, and some places will also have snowfall. Under such climatic conditions, the broad masses of people in urban and rural areas, especially in production sites such as factories and mines and water conservancy construction sites, must do a good job in advance to prevent the cold, pay attention to nutrition and adjust work and rest, and can also take preventive medicines and vaccinations. Experience has proved that no matter how changeable the spring climate is, as long as attention is paid to hygiene and preventive work is done well, the spread of infectious diseases can be controlled and the smooth completion of spring production tasks can be guaranteed.
    What is especially important is that it is now the season when mosquitoes and flies begin to become active. Their vitality is still weak, and they are relatively easy to catch and eliminate; and eliminating one overwintering mosquito or fly now is equivalent to eliminating tens of millions of mosquitoes and flies in summer and autumn. At the same time, eliminating their breeding conditions as early as possible now, followed by strengthening control, can also accelerate the progress of the entire patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests and pay attention to hygiene. Therefore, all localities should take various measures to seize the time to carry out spring sanitation work and continuously promote the patriotic sanitation movement.
    At present, industrial and mining production in various places is in full swing, and the countryside is busy with spring plowing preparations. There is a shortage of labor and time is tight. To do a good job in spring sanitation work, it is necessary to adopt various methods that have been effective in the past to combine sanitation with production. For example, combined with manure accumulation, pigsties, toilets, chicken coops, and smelly ditches can be transformed, pig, cattle, and sheep pens can be built in the fields, and special personnel can be assigned to accumulate and make fertilizer, and the fertilizer can be harmlessly treated, which not only eliminates the breeding conditions for mosquitoes and flies, but also accumulates more fertilizer and improves fertilizer efficiency. For example, in the process of water conservancy construction, migrant workers can be trained to master simple methods of eliminating snails, and the work of eliminating schistosomiasis can also be done at the same time. In addition, some sanitation work that cannot be completely combined with production and life, such as sparrow and rat extermination, can be organized by special forces, such as primary and middle school students using holidays, and the elderly carrying out short-term blitz in their spare time from housework.
    In doing a good job in spring hygiene work, sanitation workers in various places should carry forward the spirit of serving the masses and serving production and construction, give full play to their enthusiasm and creativity, actively conduct investigations and research on the relevant actual situations, put forward practical and feasible measures for each period of work, and serve as hygiene work consultants for the party committees of factories, mines, and communes. Hospitals and other medical institutions in various places should carry out health education in a planned way, teach the broad masses the techniques of eliminating pests and diseases, and help the masses summarize and promote experience in health work in a timely manner. In newly built factories and mines and water conservancy construction sites, it is necessary to establish health institutions or organize mobile medical teams (groups) in a timely manner.
    We believe that with the active actions of health departments, health workers, and the broad masses of people across the country, we will be able to further improve health work and ensure that greater victories are achieved on the production front!

### 搞好春季卫生工作

    搞好春季卫生工作
    六十年代的第一个春天到来了，全国人民以欢欣鼓舞的心情宣告提前三年完成了五年计划的主要指标。今年，全国人民切盼着用自己的双手，作出更惊人的成绩，使1960年出现一个更好更全面的跃进。为了保证这一愿望成为现实，抓卫生工作，使每一个劳动者身强力壮，生龙活虎地劳动，是各项工作中的一个重要环节。
    卫生工作，同其他工作一样，要看得远，抓得早。春季已经来临，许多厂矿和水利工地都开始准备撤除防寒设备，许多人也开始减少衣服，但是春天气候多变，容易发生伤风感冒和流行性感冒等呼吸道传染病。根据气象预报，本月中旬有很多地方将受到大寒潮的侵袭，气候骤冷骤热，有些地方还要降雪。在这样的气候条件下，各地城乡广大人民特别是在厂矿和水利工地等生产现场，必须事先做好防寒等工作，注意营养和调剂劳逸，还可以服预防药和进行预防接种。经验证明，不管春季的气候是怎样的多变，只要注意卫生，做好预防工作，就可以控制传染病的流行，保证春季生产任务的顺利完成。
    尤其重要的是，目前正是蚊蝇开始活动的时节，它们的生命力还薄弱，比较容易捕打消灭；而且在现在消灭一个越冬蚊蝇，就等于在夏秋季消灭千万个蚊蝇。同时，在现在及早地消灭它们的孳生条件，继之以加紧控制，也可以加速整个除四害讲卫生运动的进展。所以，各地应当采取各种办法，抓紧进行春季卫生工作，把爱国卫生运动持续地向前推进。
    目前，各地工矿生产正搞得热火朝天，农村正忙于备耕，劳力不足，时间紧迫，要作好春季卫生工作，就要采取过去行之有效的各种结合生产的办法。例如，结合积肥，对猪圈、厕所、鸡窠和臭水沟等进行改造，把猪、牛、羊圈建到田间，并配备专人积肥造肥，对肥料进行无害化处理，既消灭了蚊蝇的孳生条件，又多积了肥，并且提高了肥效。又如，在兴修水利过程中，可以训练民工掌握简单的消灭钉螺的办法，也就可以同时作了消灭血吸虫病的工作。此外，有一些与生产、生活不能完全结合的卫生工作，如灭雀灭鼠等，可以组织专门力量，如中小学生利用假期，老年人在干家务之余进行短期突击。
    各地卫生工作人员在搞好春季卫生工作中，就要发扬卫生工作为群众服务、为生产建设服务的精神，高度发挥积极性和创造性，主动地对有关的实际情况进行调查研究，对每一时期的工作提出切实可行的措施，当好工厂矿山公社党委的卫生工作参谋。各地医院等医疗机构要有计划地开展卫生宣传，把除害灭病技术教给广大群众，及时帮助群众总结和推广卫生工作经验。在新建厂矿和水利工地，有必要及时建立卫生机构，或组织巡回医疗队（组）。
    我们相信，在全国卫生部门、卫生工作人员和广大人民群众的积极行动下，一定能够进一步搞好卫生工作，保证生产战线上获得更大的胜利！
