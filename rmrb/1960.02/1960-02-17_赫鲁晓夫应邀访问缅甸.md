Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, February 16th: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, and his entourage arrived in Rangoon by plane today from Calcutta, India. Khrushchev is visiting Burma for three days at the invitation of the Burmese government.

Welcoming Khrushchev and his party at the airport were Burmese President U Win Maung, Prime Minister General Ne Win, Chief Judge of the Supreme Court U Myint Thein, Chairman of the Chamber of Nationalities Sao Hkun Hkio, Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies U Tin, cabinet ministers, senior military officers, and foreign diplomatic envoys.

U Win Maung delivered a welcoming speech at the airport, saying that Burma welcomes the Soviet leader who has come here to strengthen the existing friendly ties between the two countries. He said that this friendship "has developed on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence." U Win Maung said, "I particularly mention this because I believe that the spirit of increased understanding and the atmosphere of reconciliation, which are becoming more widespread throughout the world today, reflect the increasing recognition by more and more countries of the correctness of these principles. This is indeed a gratifying transformation in the international arena, and it requires all of us to make greater efforts in jointly seeking peace." The Burmese President said that Burma highly values Khrushchev's contribution to the cause of world peace.

U Win Maung said that Khrushchev's visit will help strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries and will be conducive to the cause of international peace and understanding.

In his reply, Khrushchev thanked General Ne Win for inviting him to visit Burma. He said that although his visit to Burma would be short, it would not prevent him from discussing issues of deep concern to the Soviet Union and Burma with Prime Minister Ne Win and other Burmese leaders.

In his speech, Khrushchev emphasized the significance of universal disarmament and the pursuit of peace. He said, "We feel close to and understand the Burmese government and people's firm efforts to strive for peace." He said, "We believe that our meeting with the Burmese leaders can promote the development of friendship between our two countries and the great cause of safeguarding lasting peace."

Xinhua News Agency, February 16th: According to TASS, Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, and his party concluded their five-day visit to India and left Calcutta for Rangoon this morning.

Khrushchev visited the Bhilai Steel Plant on the 14th. On the 15th, he visited the industrial city of Calcutta in India.

Khrushchev delivered a speech at a mass rally at the Bhilai Steel Plant. He said, "The liberation of the people of former colonies and semi-colonies is only the first step towards true independence. To achieve complete independence, a highly developed national economy is needed."

He then refuted the colonialist fallacy propagated by Western economists that nationally independent countries should abandon developing industry and continue to concentrate on producing agricultural products. He believes that these "theories" reflect the desires of monopoly capital, and this absurd international division of labor plunges hundreds of millions of people into poverty. He said that the West uses its "aid" as a tool to pursue colonialist policies, as a means of ensuring the interests of monopoly capital, and as a means of deepening the political division of the world into hostile blocs.

Yesterday, the Governor of West Bengal, Mrs. Naidu, hosted a banquet in honor of Khrushchev.

    赫鲁晓夫应邀访问缅甸
    新华社仰光16日电　苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员今天从印度的加尔各答乘飞机到达仰光。赫鲁晓夫应缅甸政府邀请来缅甸作为期三天的访问。
    到机场欢迎赫鲁晓夫一行人的有缅甸总统吴温貌、总理奈温将军、最高法院首席法官吴敏登、民族院议长萧恢塔、代表院议长吴丁、内阁部长、高级军官和各国外交使节。
    吴温貌在机场致欢迎词说，缅甸欢迎为加强两国现有的友好联系而来这里的苏联领袖。他说，这种友谊“在和平共处的五项原则的基础上已有发展”。吴温貌说，“我特别提到这点，这是因为我认为，今天普及全世界的增进谅解的精神以及和解的气氛，反映出愈来愈多的国家承认这些原则的正确性。这的确是国际上的可喜的转变，它要求我们大家在共同谋求和平方面作出更大的努力。”缅甸总统说，缅甸非常重视赫鲁晓夫在争取世界和平方面所作出的贡献。
    吴温貌说，赫鲁晓夫的访问将有助于加强两国的友好关系，将有利于国际和平及谅解的事业。
    赫鲁晓夫致答词时感谢奈温将军邀请他访问缅甸。他说，虽然他在缅甸访问的时间是短促的，可是这并不妨碍他同奈温总理以及缅甸其他领导人讨论苏联和缅甸深切关心的问题。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中着重谈到普遍裁军和争取和平的意义。他说，“缅甸政府和人民为争取和平所作的坚定的努力我们是感到亲切和理解的。”他说：“我们相信，我们同缅甸领导人的会晤能够促进我们两国友谊的发展和维护持久和平的伟大事业。”
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社消息：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和他的一行人结束了在印度五天的访问，于今天上午离开加尔各答前往仰光。
    赫鲁晓夫在14日访问了比莱钢铁厂。15日访问了印度的工业城市加尔各答。
    赫鲁晓夫在比莱钢铁厂的群众大会上发表演说。他说，“过去的殖民地和半殖民地的各国人民获得自由，仅仅是走向真正独立的第一步。为获得完全独立，需要高度发达的民族经济。”
    他接着驳斥了西方经济学家宣传民族独立国家最好放弃发展工业，仍然集中力量来生产农产品等殖民主义的谬论。他认为这些“理论”反映出垄断资本的欲望，而这种荒谬的国际劳动分工使亿万人民陷于贫困境地。他说，西方利用自己的“援助”作为推行殖民主义政策的工具，作为保证垄断资本的利益和加深世界在政治上分裂成敌对集团的工具。昨天，西孟加拉邦邦长奈都夫人设宴招待了赫鲁晓夫。
