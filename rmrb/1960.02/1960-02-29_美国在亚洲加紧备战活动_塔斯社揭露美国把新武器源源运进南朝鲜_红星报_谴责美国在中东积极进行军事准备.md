Xinhua News Agency, February 27th: TASS, Moscow, February 26th: TASS commentator Kharkov wrote in a commentary on the expansion of armaments and war preparations by the United States and the Syngman Rhee group in South Korea that the occupation of South Korea by the United States military is not only the cause of the tragedy of the Korean people's national division, but also the root cause of the tense situation on the Korean Peninsula that threatens the cause of peace. The Korean armistice is in a rather unstable state due to serious violations by the United States and the Syngman Rhee authorities. The U.S. side, disregarding the terms of the armistice agreement, is now continuously shipping various new weapons into South Korea, not only to replenish its own troops, but also to replenish the Syngman Rhee army.

Syngman Rhee himself admitted on February 24 that missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads are being shipped from the United States to South Korea.

According to reports, the U.S. troops occupying South Korea have now been reorganized into so-called atomic combat units. The U.S. side also wants to implement this reorganization in the South Korean army, for example, by establishing five South Korean combat units equipped with "Honest John" rockets near the military demarcation line. U.S. news agencies reported from Seoul that "Nike-Hercules" missiles capable of carrying atomic warheads will also be handed over to South Korean troops in the future.

The rampant war preparations carried out by the United States in South Korea are also reflected in the increase in U.S. military aid to the Syngman Rhee authorities this year. It has allocated approximately $209 million to South Korea, which, together with some military orders left over from last year, totals almost $254.45 million.

The commentator also said that the United States clearly wants to use military ties to link South Korea with other U.S. allies in Asia to build a branch of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. What illustrates this is that a special South Korean delegation led by Kim Dong-jo, a confidant of Syngman Rhee, has been sent to the Philippines, Thailand, South Vietnam, and Taiwan. Some reports say that the South Korean delegation mainly discussed "military cooperation issues" with its partners, which has attracted people's attention.

The commentator concluded by saying that the clouds of war danger hanging over the Korean Peninsula must be dispelled. Here, as in other parts of the world, the hotbeds of potential war threats must be eliminated, which certain international groups believe are of direct benefit to them.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 27th: The Soviet "Red Star" newspaper today pointed out in an international commentary that the purpose of Iran's proposal to establish a group of Islamic countries is part of the United States' military preparations in the Near and Middle East.

The commentary said that just as people all over the world are enthusiastically supporting the Soviet Union's proposal for complete disarmament, the general staff of aggressive blocs has decided to actively carry out military preparations.

The commentary pointed out that the meeting of the three Islamic member states of the Central Treaty Organization held in West Pakistan was precisely for this purpose. The meeting discussed the issue of jointly fighting against the so-called "communist threat," the issue of strengthening the military equipment of Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan, the issue of establishing a joint military command of the Central Treaty Organization, and the issue of closer ties between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization.

The commentary said that it is clear that these steps can only further complicate the situation in the Near and Middle East and further subordinate Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan to the interests of imperialism.

The commentary emphasized that since the United States concluded bilateral agreements with Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan in March last year, it has seized leadership of the Central Treaty Organization and established military bases on the territories of these countries to oppose the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and to oppose the national liberation movements of the peoples of various Eastern countries. The direct military expenditures of these countries have accounted for 50% of their national budgets.

The commentary said that the military preparations of the Asian participating countries of the Central Treaty Organization are a serious threat to neighboring countries and a serious threat to the cause of peace in the Near and Middle East. It is noteworthy that along with these preparations are attempts to bring other countries into the Central Treaty Organization. The proposal by the King of Iran to establish a group of Islamic countries is to bring other Islamic neutral countries into this military bloc. The commentary said that the Middle East remains one of the most turbulent regions in the world, and the situation there is becoming very complicated.

    美国在亚洲加紧备战活动
    塔斯社揭露美国把新武器源源运进南朝鲜
    “红星报”谴责美国在中东积极进行军事准备
    据新华社27日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科26日讯：塔斯社评论员哈尔科夫在评论美国和李承晚集团在南朝鲜扩军备战时写道，美国军队占领南朝鲜，不但是造成朝鲜人民处于民族分裂状态的悲剧的原因，而且也是造成朝鲜半岛上威胁着和平事业的紧张局势的根源。朝鲜的停战，由于美国和李承晚当局的严重破坏而处在相当不稳定的状态。美方现在不顾停战协定条款，把各种新式武器源源运进南朝鲜，不仅用来补充自己的军队，还用来补充李承晚军队。
    李承晚自己就曾经在2月24日承认，可以装置核弹头的导弹正在从美国运到南朝鲜。
    据报道，侵占南朝鲜的美军现在已经改组成所谓原子战斗单位。美方也想在南朝鲜军队中实行这种改组，譬如，想要在军事分界线附近建立配备“诚实的约翰”式火箭的五支南朝鲜战斗部队。美国通讯社发自汉城的消息说，将来还要把可以装置原子弹头的“奈克—赫尔克里士”式导弹交给南朝鲜部队。
    美国在南朝鲜进行的猖狂的备战活动还反映在，美国给李承晚当局的军事援助今年有所增加。它为南朝鲜拨款约二亿零九百万美元，再加上去年留下的一些军事订货，总数几乎达到二亿五千四百五十万美元。
    评论员又说，美国显然想用军事纽带把南朝鲜同美国在亚洲的其他盟国联结起来，建成一条东南亚条约组织的支线。在这方面可以说明问题的是，一个由李承晚的亲信金东祚率领的南朝鲜特别使团已被派到菲律宾、泰国、南越和台湾去了。有的消息说，南朝鲜使团同自己的伙伴主要是讨论“军事合作问题”，这些消息引起了人们的注意。
    评论员最后说，在朝鲜半岛上空的带着战争危险的乌云必须驱散。在这里和在世界的其他地区一样，必须消灭潜在的战争威胁的温床，而某些国际集团认为，保持这种战争威胁的温床对他们有着直接的利益。
    据新华社莫斯科27日电　苏联“红星报”今天在一篇国际评论中指出，伊朗提出的成立伊斯兰教国家集团的目的是美国在中近东进行军事准备的一部分。
    评论说，正当全世界人民热烈支持苏联的全面裁军的建议的时候，侵略集团的参谋部却决定积极进行军事准备。
    评论指出，在西巴基斯坦所召开的中央条约组织的三个伊斯兰成员国会议正是为了这个目的。会议讨论了共同对所谓“共产主义威胁”作斗争的问题，加强土耳其、伊朗、巴基斯坦三国军备的问题，成立中央条约组织联合军事指挥部问题，以及北大西洋公约组织同中央条约组织更密切联系的问题。
    评论说，很显然，这些步骤只能使中近东局势更加复杂化，使土、伊、巴三国进一步服从于帝国主义的利益。
    评论强调指出，美国从去年3月同土、伊、巴三国订立了双边协定之后，就攫取了中央条约组织的领导权，在这些国家的领土上建立了军事基地，来反对苏联和其他社会主义国家，反对东方各国人民的民族解放运动。这些国家的直接军事支出已占到它们国家预算的50％。
    评论说，中央条约组织亚洲参加国的军事准备是对邻国的严重威胁，是对中近东和平事业的严重威胁。值得注意的是，随着这些准备的还有把其他国家拉入中央条约组织的企图。伊朗国王所提出的成立伊斯兰国家集团的建议，就是为了把其他的伊斯兰中立国家拉进这个军事集团。评论说，中近东仍然是世界上最不平静的一个地区，那里的局势正在非常复杂化。
