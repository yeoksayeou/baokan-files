    New Style, New Design
    By Our Reporter Deng Zuomin
    In front of the floor plan of the large rolling mill factory of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO), the factory's Party Committee Secretary explained the plan to us. This factory building, about one meter long on the design drawing, will actually be more than half a mile long; the highest point of the factory building is about the height of a seven-story building, while the depth of the underground foundation is no less than four stories; more than a dozen kinds of pipelines, as dense as a spider web, are buried in it, and more than ninety different types of equipment will be installed in the factory building. After this rolling mill is completed, it can produce a large number of steel products of various types for the country.
    This huge and complex modern large rolling mill was designed by our own country, and the equipment was also manufactured by our own country. From this, we can see the leap-forward development of China's ferrous metallurgical design and machinery manufacturing capabilities. The Party Committee Secretary emphasized during the introduction: Without the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, and without the Great Leap Forward of 1958 and 1959, it would be unimaginable for China to design such a factory by itself and manufacture a complete set of equipment.
          A Debate
    When discussing whether this factory should be designed domestically or by a foreign country, there was a debate.
    Some people believed that domestic design was not possible because the factory was too large and too complex, we had no experience, and many important equipment could not be manufactured domestically at that time. Others advocated doing it ourselves. We basically have the conditions for self-designing such factories, and there are many advantages to doing it ourselves: First, we can concentrate our efforts to complete it as soon as possible according to our needs. Second, we can reasonably lower certain design standards, reduce the amount of steel and equipment used, and save funds without affecting total output according to China's specific conditions. Third, some important equipment had not been manufactured domestically at that time, but China's electromechanical industry, after several years of rapid development since liberation, especially after the Great Leap Forward, has been able to manufacture relatively advanced and large-scale products. As long as we make an effort, this equipment can be manufactured. Moreover, manufacturing the entire set of equipment domestically can not only save foreign exchange but also promote the further development of China's electromechanical industry. As for the lack of experience in design, it can be completely solved under the leadership of the Party through vigorous mass movements, learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and striving for the assistance of Soviet experts. The relevant personnel, based on the spirit of daring to think and act, striving for high speed, and striving for more, faster, better, and more economical results, unified their opinions after a debate, and those who did not dare to design themselves also gained confidence. The staff of the Wuhan Ferrous Metallurgical Design Institute, who were responsible for the design task of this factory building, took active action under the leadership of the Party Committee. They started the design work of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's large rolling mill, referring to the preliminary design plan of the Baotou Steel large rolling mill made by the Soviet Union.
          Relying on "Outsiders"
    After the initial design was made, the Party Committee of the institute mobilized the masses to speak out freely and conducted a large-scale quality inspection for nearly a month. Some people disagreed with this approach. They said: Design work is an individual effort, and it is like being in a different world, "an outsider equals zero." The Party Committee criticized this wrong view.
    What was the actual situation? The quality inspection of the rolling mill specialty vividly illustrates that outsiders are not equal to zero, but have a great effect. According to statistics, the masses of workers posted 2,850 big-character posters on this design, of which only 350 were posted by professionals, and the rest were posted by so-called "outsiders," and about 90% of their opinions were correct.
          Modestly Learning
    There is a chimney in the large rolling mill. The chimney was originally designed to be 100 meters high. During the quality inspection, many people raised objections to its height. Some said it was too low, and some said it was too high, each with their own reasons. The designers went to the production plant to visit and, after preliminary calculations, found that it should be 140 or 150 meters high. However, it was difficult to construct if it was too high, and the smoke could not be discharged if it was too low. They once considered adding a smoke pump to help exhaust the smoke, but this smoke pump would consume 90,000 yuan of electricity per year, which was unreasonable.
    So they went to consult Soviet experts and asked the Wuhan Institute of Iron and Steel Technology to help with the calculations. Comrade Batunov, the leader of the Soviet expert group at WISCO, immediately telegraphed back to his country to inquire about solutions; the design institute also wrote to relevant departments in the Soviet Union for advice. The design institutes in Moscow and Leningrad in the Soviet Union quickly sent letters offering valuable opinions. The designers determined the height of the chimney to be 120 meters based on their opinions and calculated data, and the problem was solved.
            Caring for Production
    Close integration with the actual production situation is a prominent feature of this design. For example, the original design of the main electrical room of the factory building did not have water-cooled ventilation equipment, which was designed according to theoretical books and existing regulations. Later, they went to the production site and felt unbearably hot when entering the pump room, so they added water-cooled equipment to the design of the main electrical room.
    Throughout the entire design process, the design institute held more than 30 meetings with the factory, and the layout of major equipment was determined after repeated joint research. For smaller issues, the design institute consulted with the factory even more frequently. Therefore, the design of this factory was relatively closely related to the actual production.
            Bold Creativity
    The communist style of daring to think and act increased the wisdom of the designers. For example, most rolling mills used three-stage heating furnaces in the past. Based on the situation and production needs of WISCO, they took measures to increase the furnace area, increase output, and achieve uniform heating, reducing the three heating furnaces to two. They also creatively adopted new measures in the supply of gas, so that the heating of steel ingots could use gas with a lower calorific value, and the gas with a higher calorific value could be used to recover more chemical fertilizers. The designers also carefully calculated and researched, and boldly adopted pre-stressed concrete roof trusses in the high-temperature workshops with large spans, reducing the amount of steel used to a quarter of that of steel roof trusses.
    It was with this bold and scientific attitude that the designers saved a large amount of equipment that could be saved and improved the structure of the factory building. As a result, the investment in the construction of the WISCO large rolling mill was reduced by half compared to similar factories, and the weight of the equipment was also reduced by half, while the designed production capacity remained at the same level, and room was left for further increasing output in the future.
    Through this design, they not only improved their skills but also better established the communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do. Now, they are confident in undertaking the design of even larger and more complex factory buildings, and they are already doing so.

    新风格  新设计
    本报记者　邓作民
    在武钢大型轧钢厂厂房平面布置图前，厂党委书记指着图给我们讲解。这座在设计图纸上长约一米的厂房，实际将是一里多路长；厂房的最高处约相当七层楼房那么高，而地下基础的深度，不低于四层楼房；密如蛛网的十几种管道埋设其中，厂房里还将安装九十多种不同类型的设备。这座轧钢厂建成以后，可以为国家生产大批多品种的钢材。
    这座巨大而复杂的现代化的大型轧钢厂，是我国自己设计的，设备也是我国自己制造的。从这里，可以看到我国黑色冶金设计和机械制造能力在飞跃发展。党委书记在介绍情况时强调指出：如果没有党的社会主义建设总路线，没有1958年和1959年的大跃进，我国要自己设计这样的工厂，自己制造全套设备，是不可想像的。
          一番争论
    在讨论这个厂由国内设计还是请国外设计的时候，曾经有过一番争论。
    有的人认为国内不能设计，因为厂子太大太复杂，自己没有经验，而且许多重要设备当时国内不能制造。另一些人主张自己干。这样的工厂，我们已经基本上具备了自行设计的条件，而自己干有很多好处：首先，可以根据需要，集中力量尽快完成。其次，可以在不影响总产量的条件下，根据我国的具体情况，合理地降低某些设计标准，减少钢材和设备的用量，节约资金。第三，有些重要设备当时国内没有制造过，但是我国机电工业经过解放后几年的迅速发展，特别是经过大跃进，已经能够制造比较高级、大型的产品，只要鼓一把劲，这些设备是能制造出来的。而整套设备全部由国内制造，不仅能节约外汇，而且能促进我国机电工业的进一步发展。至于设计缺乏经验的问题，完全可以在党的领导下，通过大搞群众运动，学习苏联先进经验，争取苏联专家的帮助等方法来解决。有关人员本着敢想敢干、力争高速度、力争多快好省的精神，经过一番辩论，意见统一了起来，不敢自己设计的人信心也增强了。担任这座厂房设计任务的武汉黑色冶金设计院的职工们，在党委的领导下积极行动起来。他们参照苏联为包钢大型轧钢厂作的初步设计的平面图，开始了武钢大型轧钢厂的设计工作。
          借助“外行”
    在设计初步作出以后，院党委发动群众大鸣大放，进行了为时将近一月的质量大检查。有些人不同意这样作。他们说：设计工作是个体劳动，隔行如隔山，“外行等于零”。党委批判了这种错误的观点。
    实际情况怎样呢？轧钢专业的质量检查就生动地说明：外行并不等于零，而是作用大得很。据统计，职工群众对这一设计贴出了二千八百五十张大字报，其中由本专业人员贴的只有三百五十张，其余都是所谓“外行”贴出的，而且其中90％左右的意见是正确的。
          虚心学习
    大型轧钢厂有一座烟囱。这座烟囱最先设计的是一百米高，在质量检查中，许多人对它的高度提了意见。有的说低了，有的说高了，各有理由。设计人员就到生产厂去参观，经过初步计算，竟要一百四、五十米高。但是，太高了难以施工，低了烟又排不出去。他们曾经打算加个烟泵帮助排烟，可是这个烟泵每年要耗用九万元的电流，这是不合理的。
    他们于是去向苏联专家请教，同时请武汉钢铁学院帮助计算。武钢的苏联专家组长巴杜诺夫同志立即打电报回国，询问解决的办法；设计院也写信向苏联有关部门请教。苏联莫斯科和列宁格勒的设计院很快地来了信，提出了极有价值的意见。设计人员根据他们的意见和计算的数据，把烟囱的高度确定为一百二十米，问题就这样解决了。
            关心生产
    紧密结合生产实际，是这个设计的一个突出的特点。例如，厂房主电室原来的设计没有水冷通风设备，这是按照理论书和原有规定设计出来的。后来他们下到生产现场，进入水泵房时感到热得难受，回来以后就把主电室的设计增加了水冷设备。
    在整个设计过程中，设计院请厂方开了三十多次会，重大设备布置都是经过多次的共同研究确定的。对于比较小的问题，设计院同厂方往来磋商就更多了。因此，这个厂的设计作到了比较切合生产实际。
            大胆创造
    敢想敢干的共产主义风格，使设计人员增加了智慧。例如：以前大部分轧钢厂都采用三段式加热炉，他们根据武钢的情况和生产需要，采取措施，增大炉体面积，作到了增加产量，加热均匀，将三座加热炉减为两座。他们在供给燃气方面又创造性地采用了新的措施，使加热钢锭能使用发热量较低的煤气，把较高发热量的煤气用来多回收化学肥料。设计人员还经过仔细计算研究，在大跨度的高温车间大胆地采用了预应力混凝土屋架，使钢材用量减少到钢屋架的四分之一。
    设计人员就是以这种大胆而科学的态度，节省了大量可能节省的设备，改进了厂房结构，结果使建设武钢大型轧钢厂的投资，比同类厂的投资减少了一半，设备重量也减少了一半，而设计生产能力却保持了同等的水平，并给今后进一步提高产量留下了余地。
    通过这次设计，他们不仅提高了技术，而且更好地树立了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，现在，他们已经有信心承担比这更大更复杂的厂房的设计，而且已经正在这样干了。
