    Spring Plowing Rhyme
    Triumphant Song High
    Spring breeze blows, ice and snow melt away,
    Thousands of channels link to mountain waists,
    Golden water irrigates the land with gurgling laughter,
    Overcoming the drought demon, triumphant song is high.
    Learn from the Secretary
    On the first day of the Lunar New Year, accumulating fertilizer is busy,
    The secretary carries a golden manure basket on his back,
    Everyone takes him as an example,
    Sufficient fertilizer in spring plowing, granaries full of grain.
    [Commune Member Dai Yongqing]
    Spring Irrigation
    Channel water flows endlessly in curves,
    Like a green dragon swimming through mountains and rivers,
    Commune members wield hoes to lead the green dragon,
    Ten thousand acres of wheat fields ripple green waves.
    Irrigating until the red sun sets in the west sea,
    Irrigating until the silver moon hangs in the eastern sky,
    Irrigating until the morning glow trims the field ridges,
    A chorus of songs scatters along the canal.
    [Commune Member Heng Chun]
    Sewing Spring Clothes
    In February comes the beautiful spring,
    Winter sweet blossoms send fragrance to all corners of the land,
    Grasping water, grasping fertilizer, grasping tools,
    Busily sewing spring clothes for the earth.
      [Peng Bo, Hu Jie]
    Snow Clods
    Golden nuggets, silver nuggets,
    Not as good as the 'counting nines' snow clods,
    Thousands of carts and ten thousands of loads sent to the fields,
    Summer harvest wheat stacks piled like pagodas.
          [Hui Yongzhen]
    Delivering Fertilizer
    You chase, I rush to deliver fertilizer,
    Mountain songs fly along with the whip cracks;
    Singing makes hearts like fire,
    Singing makes fertilizer pile up at the field's edge.
            [He Jincai]

专栏：春耕谣

    春耕谣
    凯歌高
    春风吹来冰雪消，
    千条渠水系山腰，
    金水灌地哗哗笑，
    战胜旱魔凯歌高。
    学书记
    大年初一积肥忙，
    书记背起金粪筐，
    人人以他做榜样，
    春耕肥足粮满仓。
    〔公社社员戴永清〕
    春灌
    渠水湾湾流不断，
    好似青龙游山川，
    社员舞锨引青龙，
    万顷麦田碧浪翻。
    灌得红日落西海，
    灌得银月挂东天，
    灌得朝霞镶田埂，
    一片歌声撒渠边。
    〔公社社员恒　春〕
    缝春装
    二月里来好春光，
    迎春花开四海香，
    抓水抓肥抓工具，
    忙给大地缝春装。
      〔彭波、胡洁〕
    雪疙瘩
    金疙瘩，银疙瘩，
    不如数九雪疙瘩，
    千车万担送到地，
    夏收麦垛堆宝塔。
          〔惠永珍〕
    送肥
    你追我赶送肥料，
    山歌随着鞭梢飞；
    唱得心儿火一样，
    唱得地头肥成堆。
            〔贺进才〕
