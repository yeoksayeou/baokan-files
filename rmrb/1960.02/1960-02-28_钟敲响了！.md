    The Bell Tolls!
    Liu Feng
    In the Tongjialiang Mine Mechanical Branch of the Datong Coal Mine in Shanxi, there is a worker named Mao A'mao. He saw that some coal mines were still using manual labor to load coal carts, which was laborious and inefficient. He thought that the Party often called for ways to improve labor productivity and liberate heavy physical labor. Isn't this precisely the problem that mechanical workers should solve? A high sense of political responsibility led him to make a firm resolution to manufacture a coal loading machine to replace manual coal loading. When Mao A'mao initiated the proposal for a coal loading machine, some people said, "It's as likely as using a feather to strike a bell – it won't make a sound." However, under the leadership of the Party, relying on the masses and the help of technical personnel, Mao A'mao struggled tenaciously for three years, and after more than eighty failures, finally produced the coal loading machine that the miners had longed for. This coal loading machine can load sixty tons of coal per hour, equivalent to the work of twenty-four people per day.
    Those who look down on Comrade Mao A'mao's ability to create and invent mainly do so because he has poor conditions and a weak foundation. These are all facts. Mao A'mao originally did not know many characters, was not highly educated, had neither engaged in design nor studied any profound theories. But what does that matter? What he has is the desire to resolutely respond to the Party's call, and the ambition of the working class. The Party and his comrades encouraged him and supported him, so he dared to invent and create, and dared to innovate. With such a communist style, he would not consider his own foundation, his abilities, success or failure; regardless, he was determined to manufacture a coal loading machine to replace manual coal loading. This is an attitude of ownership, and it is also the true color of our working class today.
    Did Mao A'mao encounter difficulties? Of course he did, and many. Mao A'mao looked at many drawings, saw many machines, proposed many plans, consulted many teachers, thought day and night, and forgot to eat and sleep, finally drawing a blueprint. However, this was only the first step. Difficulties piled up, waiting for him ahead, ready to challenge him. During the first coal loading machine demonstration, it moved a few times and then stopped. But with the support of the Party organization, he not only did not lose heart, but instead became even more energetic. When others got off work, he seized the time to work on the machine. The coal loading machine was assembled and tested again and again, and failed again and again, but he re-experimented again and again, never giving up until he achieved his goal.
    In our society, everything that is conducive to the revolutionary cause will be supported by the Party. Moreover, Mao A'mao's important creation! The Party extended a strong hand in his experimental process, giving full play to the strength of the collective, and formed an innovation team composed of administrative personnel, technical personnel, and veteran workers. The technical personnel explained from a theoretical perspective, the veteran workers spoke from a practical perspective, you said one thing and I said another, and with many people, wisdom was widespread, and many problems were solved. It was in this way, in continuous experimentation, that Mao A'mao grew up, and he became stronger.
    Thus, the bell was struck, making a loud sound. Who struck it? Mao A'mao was never a feather in the first place, but a man of iron. It was only those who still have conservative ideas who saw him as a feather. In the mass movement to vigorously promote technical innovation and technical revolution, people like Mao A'mao are truly everywhere by the thousands and tens of thousands. Listen, throughout the country, from the Northeast to Hainan, from Xinjiang to the coast, aren't the bells of technical innovation and technical revolution ringing loudly? Aren't there thousands and tens of thousands of people like Mao A'mao, using their working-class spirit and drive, with their revolutionary redness and strong will, constantly striking the giant bell?

    钟敲响了！
    刘丰
    山西大同煤矿同家梁矿机械分厂有位工人，名叫毛阿毛。他看到有些煤矿装煤推车还是在用手工装煤，费力大，效率低，想到党经常号召要设法提高劳动生产效率，解放笨重的体力劳动，这不正是机械工人应该解决的问题吗？高度的政治责任感使他从此立下雄心大志，决心要制造一台装煤机来代替人工装煤。在毛阿毛发起装煤机倡议的时候，有一些人就说：“保险是鸡毛打钟，没音”。可是毛阿毛在党的领导下，依靠群众和技术人员的帮助，顽强斗争三年，经过大小八十多次的失败，终于制成了矿工们渴望已久的装煤机。这台装煤机每小时可装煤六十吨，一天能顶二十四个人干活。
    看不起毛阿毛同志能创造发明的人，主要因为他条件差，基础不好。这些都是事实。毛阿毛本来识字不多，文化不高，既没有搞过设计，又没学过什么高深理论。可是，这又有什么关系呢？他有的是坚决响应党的号召的愿望，有的是工人阶级的雄心壮志。党和同志们鼓舞着他，支持着他，于是就敢于发明创造，敢于革新。有了这样的共产主义风格，他就不会去考虑到自己的基础如何，能力怎样，成败利钝，在所不计，一定要制造一台装煤机来代替人工装煤。这是一种主人翁的态度，也是我们今天的工人阶级的本色。
    毛阿毛有没有遇到过困难呢？当然有，而且不少。毛阿毛找过不少图样，看过不少机器，提过不少方案，请教过不少老师，日思夜想，废寝忘食，终于绘出了一张图纸。然而，这仅仅是第一步。一重重的困难，正在前面等着他，迎击他。在第一次装煤机表演时，移动了几下就不动了。可是在党组织的支持下，他不仅没有泄气，相反干劲更大了。别人下班，他就抓空利用机器干起来。装煤机一次一次装好，又一次一次地失败了，但他一次次又重新试验，不达目的决不罢休。
    在我们的社会里，一切有利于革命事业的事物，都会受到党的支持。何况毛阿毛的这个重要的创造！党在他试验的过程中伸出了有力的手，发挥了集体的力量，由行政人员，技术人员和老工人等组成革新小组。技术人员从理论上一讲，老工人从实际上一说，你一言我一语，人多智慧广，许多问题都解决了。就是这样在不断地试验中，毛阿毛成长起来，他锻炼得更坚强起来。
    就这样，钟被敲响了，发出洪亮的声音。是谁敲响了的呢？毛阿毛本来就不是鸡毛，而是铁铮铮的硬汉子。只是那些还有保守思想的人，把他看成鸡毛了。在大闹技术革新和技术革命的群众运动中，像毛阿毛这样的人，真是成千上万到处都是。你听，现在全国各地，从东北到海南，从新疆到沿海，技术革新和技术革命的钟声，不是洪亮地响着吗？不是有成千上万像毛阿毛这样的人，以他们的工人阶级的气魄和干劲，以他们的革命的红色和坚强的意志，在不停地敲着巨钟吗？
