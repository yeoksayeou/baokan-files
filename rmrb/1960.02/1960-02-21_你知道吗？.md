Did you know?

"The wool comes from the sheep," is an old Chinese saying. For many years, people have only been accustomed to shearing wool from sheep. Few have put their minds to finding ways to shear fur and feathers from other poultry and livestock.

Now people are breaking with convention and starting to demand bristles, hair, feathers, and down from live poultry and livestock, so that each duck, goose, and pig can produce more hair and bristles.

Perhaps some people worry that plucking feathers will kill the live ducks. In fact, shedding and molting are normal physiological phenomena for live livestock and poultry at a certain stage. Combing hair and bristles will not only not affect the health of livestock and poultry, but will also enhance their physique. Generally, livestock and poultry that have had their bristles combed and feathers plucked eat more and grow faster. Ducks that have been plucked grow new feathers in three or four days, return to their original state in two months, and can be plucked a second time. However, it is important to pay attention to plucking the ducks and geese along the direction of the feathers to avoid bleeding from the pores. Getting hair from live livestock and poultry is a direction to pursue. If all the large livestock, geese, ducks, and pigs with combable bristles in the country could have their bristles combed and feathers plucked, the total value of livestock products purchased in ten years could buy (with picture):

More than 52 million double-shared plows.

    “羊毛出在羊身上”，这是中国的一句老话。多少年来，人们只习惯从羊身上剪取羊毛，对于从其他禽畜身上剪取毛羽，却很少有人动脑筋，想办法。
    现在人们打破了陈规惯例，开始向活禽、活畜索取鬃、毛、羽、绒。让每支鸭、鹅、猪出更多的毛和鬃。
    也许有人耽心拔毛会不会把活鸭拔死。其实，活畜活禽到了一定时期，脱毛换毛，乃是正常生理现象。梳毛梳鬃，不仅不会影响畜禽的健康，反而增强畜禽的体质，一般梳了鬃、拔了羽毛的畜禽都是吃得多长肉快。拔过毛的鸭子，三、四天以后就长新的羽毛，两个月恢复原状，还可以拔第二次。但必须注意给鸭鹅拔毛的时候，要顺着毛拔，免得毛孔出血。向活畜禽要毛是个方向。如果全国所有大牲畜，鹅鸭，以及可梳鬃的猪，都应该梳鬃拔毛。十年来收购畜产品总值可购买（附图片）
