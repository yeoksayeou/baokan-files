Title: More Varieties, Higher Yields

More varieties are needed to harvest more. The sowing area for summer harvest crops this year (including the already sown overwintering crops, and the planned early rice and spring wheat) will be greatly increased compared to last year. This is the fundamental guarantee for a bumper summer harvest.

However, more varieties must also mean higher yields. Only by having more varieties and higher yields can we obtain more grain.

How can we achieve high yields? The key lies in establishing lofty ambitions, adding vigor, and intensifying the measures to increase production. The people of Guangfeng County have set a brilliant example in this regard. They have put forward the resounding slogan of "Surpassing the National Program for Agricultural Development in one season for early rice" and are using this advanced target to inspect their preparations for farming and increase measures. If water storage is insufficient, they immediately add three million cubic meters of earthwork to water conservancy projects; if fertilizer is insufficient, they organize tens of thousands of people to make a sudden effort to accumulate fertilizer... If these measures to increase production are firmly grasped one by one, we believe that the high-yield target of "Surpassing the National Program in one season" can definitely be achieved!

Striving for a bumper summer harvest is of great significance for achieving continued leaps forward in agricultural production this year. On the basis of expanding the sowing area for summer harvest crops, we should, like the people of Guangfeng County, establish lofty ambitions, add vigor, and implement production increase plans down to the contracted units, mobilizing the masses to increase measures according to advanced production targets. We will certainly be able to raise the unit yield even higher and achieve an even greater bumper summer harvest.

### 多种还要高产

    多种还要高产
    多种才能多收。今年夏收作物播种面积（包括已播的越冬作物和计划播种的早稻及春麦）将比去年大大增加，这是夏季大丰收的基本保证。
    但是，多种还要高产。只有多种、高产，才能拿到更多的粮食。
    怎样实现高产？关键在于树雄心，添干劲，使增产措施大加码。广丰县人民在这方面作出了光辉的榜样，他们提出了早稻产量“一季跨纲要”的响亮口号，并且按照这个先进指标检查备耕工作，增加措施。蓄水不够用，立即增添三百万土方的水利工程任务；肥料不足，就组织十几万人突击积肥……。这些增产措施只要一着一着地狠狠抓下去，我们相信，“一季跨纲要”的高产指标一定可以实现！
    争取夏季大丰收，对实现今年农业生产继续跃进有重要意义。在扩大夏收作物播种面积的基础上，我们应该向广丰县人民一样，树雄心，添干劲，把增产计划落实到包产单位，发动群众按照先进的生产指标增加措施，我们就一定能够把单位产量提得更高，取得夏季更大丰收。
