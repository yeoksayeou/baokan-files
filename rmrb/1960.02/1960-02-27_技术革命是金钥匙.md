    Technical Revolution is the Golden Key

    Even if a worker's work efficiency is increased a hundredfold, it is only a hundredfold. But if a hundred workers each increase their efficiency tenfold, that's a thousandfold! How much greater is the power!
        —— Wei Fengying, Northeast Machine Manufacturing Plant

    If we want to scale the peaks of production, the technical revolution is the golden key.
                            —— Steelworkers of Chongqing

    Fear neither heaven nor earth, difficulties are not a problem for me. We are determined in the technical revolution to get rid of files, chisels, and hand cranks.
                          —— Workers of Chongqing Switch Factory

    Don't look down on small factories with poor conditions. As long as you have great ambitions, you can start from scratch and realize mechanization with simple methods.
                  —— Workers of the Yangtze Fiber Textile Mill, Sichuan

    Where does skill come from? Skill comes from the collective. Where do "treasures" come from? "Treasures" must be found among the masses. As long as we rely on the Party and mobilize the masses, for every thousand difficulties that arise, we can find thousands, tens of thousands of ways to overcome them.
                          —— Workers of Chongqing Light Industry

    I am a standard-bearer of technical innovation. The greater the difficulties, the more motivated I am. Heroes are forged in the midst of difficulties, and heroes are not afraid of many difficulties.
            —— Workers of Shanghai Zhichengxing Steel Products Factory

    Charge forward when there are difficulties, attack when there are key problems, compete on the arena when there is a challenge, and contribute "treasures" when we find them.
              —— Zhang Yide, Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 12

    Learn humbly from famous brands, work hard to catch up with famous brands, and dare to think and dare to create famous brands. Compare with famous brands, learn humbly; catch up with famous brands with full confidence; create famous brands with soaring enthusiasm.
      —— Textile workers of Nanjing
