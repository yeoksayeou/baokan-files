Xinhua News Agency, 31st - According to today's Beijing Workers' Daily, the working hands specially made for Xu Xuehui by the Soviet Chita Orthopedic Equipment Factory were completed on the 29th. The entire factory held a grand celebration and get-together that day, and Xu Xuehui was invited to participate.

The celebration vividly demonstrated the deep and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. At the meeting, Lomanov, the director of the Chita Orthopedic Equipment Factory, formally handed over the specially made working hands to Xu Xuehui and personally installed them for her. Director Lomanov said: All of our factory workers are proud to be able to dedicate our efforts to the hero of our allied nation, China.

On the 26th, Xu Xuehui tried the working hands for the third and final time. On the same day, she learned to use the working hands to perform heavier tasks such as chopping firewood and hammering nails. Xu Xuehui's practice in using the prosthetic hands was always carried out under the personal guidance and enthusiastic help of Director Lomanov. The old director, who is over fifty years old, visited Xu Xuehui almost every day, teaching her a new task each time.
