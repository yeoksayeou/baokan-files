    Flower of Sino-Soviet Friendship
    Zhang Fuquan
    Deputy Director of Assembly Department, First Tractor Factory

    As the "Dongfanghong" tractors we assemble with our own hands are continuously transported to all parts of the country to support agricultural mechanization, I, as a tractor producer, feel extremely honored and excited. Our tractor assembly department, from the birth of the first "Dongfanghong" tractor to the present, has greatly exceeded the original design level in output. This general assembly line was designed according to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and our technology was taught by the Soviet elder brother himself. Two years ago, most of the workers in the entire department had never seen a tractor, but now they have all become skilled tractor assemblers. This is the result of the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the sincere assistance of the Soviet elder brother.

    In 1955, the Party sent me to the Soviet Union for an internship. When I arrived in the Soviet Union, the workers of the Kharkov Tractor Factory warmly welcomed us. Initially, I interned in the gearbox group, and the group leader personally taught me, once, twice, three times, four times… until I learned it. I came from a worker background, and I couldn't quickly remember some new technical terms. After the Soviet group leader discovered this, he taught me to learn five new terms every day in my spare time. Later, I interned on the general assembly line, and the foreman Ivan was even more enthusiastic towards me. He knew that I would also be a foreman after returning to China, so he wanted me to intern with him. Thanks to the patient help of the Soviet comrades, I learned the technology and knowledge of assembling tractors in less than a year. In those days, I formed an inseparable friendship with Ivan. When I returned to China, Ivan tightly held my hand, with tears in his eyes, and said, "Tell us about any problems in your letters." After returning to China, I taught all the technology I learned in the Soviet Union to thirty new workers and apprentices, who in turn trained more apprentices. With the help and guidance of the Soviet experts in the factory, all the workers in our department quickly mastered the technology of assembling tractors. Now, all thirty work stations on our general assembly line have exceeded the designed quota.

    The workers in our assembly department have not let down the help of the Soviet elder brother. We have not only fully utilized the technology we have learned, but have also made further progress. In the technical innovation movement, our department has achieved automatic return of electric hoists and has also manufactured automatic oil extractors, universal toolboxes, etc. We will definitely continue our efforts to produce more and better tractors, so that the flower of Sino-Soviet friendship will bloom all over the fields of the motherland.

    中苏友谊之花
    第一拖拉机厂装配工部副主任　张富宽
    当我们亲手装配出来的“东方红”拖拉机，源源运到祖国各地支援农业机械化的时候，作为一个拖拉机的生产者，我感到无比的光荣和兴奋。我们拖拉机装配工部，从第一台“东方红”拖拉机的诞生，到现在产量已经大大超过了原来的设计水平。这条总装配线，是按着苏联的先进经验设计的，我们的技术又是苏联老大哥亲手教会的。全工部的工人，在两年前，绝大部分都没有见过拖拉机，现在都成了装配拖拉机的能手。这是共产党和毛主席的英明领导，这是苏联老大哥的真诚援助的结果。
    1955年，党送我到苏联去实习。到了苏联，哈尔科夫拖拉机厂的职工热烈地欢迎我们。最初，我到变速箱小组实习，组长亲自一遍，两遍，三遍，四遍地教……直到我学会了为止。我是工人出身，对一些技术新名词，不能很快记住，苏联组长发现我这种情况后，每天在业余时间教我学会五个名词。最后，我在总装配线实习，工长伊凡对我更是热情，他知道我回国以后也要做工长，就要我跟班实习。由于苏联同志的耐心帮助，我在不到一年时间，就学会了装配拖拉机的技术和知识。在那些日子里，我和伊凡结成难舍难离的友谊。我回国的时候，伊凡紧紧握着我的手，含着满眶泪水说：“有什么问题，在信上告诉我们。”回国以后，我把在苏联学习的技术，又全部教给三十个新工人和徒工，他们又带徒弟。加上在厂的苏联专家的帮助和指导，使我们全工部的工人都很快地掌握了装配拖拉机的技术。现在，我们总装配线的三十个工位，已全部突破了设计定额。
    我们装配工部的工人，没有辜负苏联老大哥的帮助。我们不仅全部利用了所学得的技术，并且有了进一步的发展。在技术革新运动中，我们工部实现了电葫芦回程自动化，还制造了自动抽油器，万能工具箱等。我们一定再接再厉，生产出更多更好的拖拉机，让中苏友谊之花，开遍祖国的田野。
