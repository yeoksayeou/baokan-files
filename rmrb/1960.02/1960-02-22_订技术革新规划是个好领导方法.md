    Drafting Technological Innovation Plans is a Good Leadership Method

    At the beginning of 1960, factories in Yinchuan City universally formulated technological innovation and technological revolution plans. Based on this, they initially drafted city-wide first-quarter technological innovation and technological revolution plans. This signifies that the mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution in Yinchuan City has risen to a new stage of better organization and leadership.

    The shift from having no plans to having plans during the large-scale technological innovation and technological revolution in various factories is a leap forward. It demonstrates that people have a further understanding of the objective laws of technological innovation and technological revolution. Technological innovation must adapt to the new situation and be closely integrated with production. After breaking through a certain weak link, all production processes must undergo corresponding and comprehensive technological innovation and technological revolution to improve the overall production level. Adopting various new forms to lead technological innovation and technological revolution in a more organized and planned manner is the inevitable result of the development of the technological innovation movement and an objective requirement for rapidly improving current production.

    Measures that correctly reflect objective laws will inevitably guide objective practice. Formulating technological innovation plans puts us in a proactive position in the struggle to develop productive forces, thus making this struggle more effective. Formulating plans also prompts us to consider related innovations while carrying out a certain innovation and to prepare in advance. It can also prompt us to have a clear direction, consistent goals, and a sense of priority when studying and implementing numerous sporadic technological innovation proposals. It can also prompt us to better discover certain "blank spots" that have not yet been noticed by the masses when studying the masses' rationalization proposals, thereby consciously inspiring the masses to engage in large-scale technological innovation in these areas. In short, the method of formulating plans greatly benefits factories in leading technological innovation and technological revolution, making them proactive in everything, everywhere, and at all times.

    The experience of various factories in Yinchuan City proves that the process of generating technological innovation and technological revolution plans is a process of further mobilizing the masses and arousing their enthusiasm for large-scale technological innovation and technological revolution. The foundation for formulating technological innovation and technological revolution plans is the technological innovation proposals put forward by the masses. By formulating and revising plans, conscientiously studying and adopting these proposals, and mobilizing the masses to implement these proposals, undoubtedly, this will promote the masses to put forward more technological innovation proposals and accelerate the pace of various factories towards semi-mechanization or mechanization.

    After various factories have technological innovation and technological revolution plans, party organizations at all levels must further strengthen leadership, comprehensively balance the plans of various factories from a region (county, city) or a system, so as to more quickly improve the production level of the entire region or the entire system. In industrial production and construction, not only are the various processes of a certain production process closely related, but also various factories are interconnected and mutually restrictive. This requires various industrial production leadership departments to consider and guide technological innovation and technological revolution in an all-round way. Formulating a technological innovation and technological revolution plan for a region or a system provides us with many conveniences for comprehensively considering and guiding technological innovation and technological revolution, and can play a role in encouraging the advanced and motivating and driving the backward.

    Formulating technological innovation and technological revolution plans is a good experience in implementing production planning measures. The main way to complete advanced plans is to carry out mass-based technological innovation and technological revolution on a large scale. And formulating technological innovation and technological revolution plans, implementing the "five fixings" system of fixing projects, fixing time, fixing personnel, fixing measures, and fixing inspections, makes it easier to give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses.

    The purpose of formulating plans is to achieve continuous leaps forward. Therefore, after having a plan, it is necessary to firmly grasp inspection, summary, and evaluation, and exchange experiences through forms such as on-site meetings, skills competitions, and technical performance meetings to check the implementation of the plan. With the correct plan as a basis, we must firmly grasp it and never let go, and see it through to the end. Layer-by-layer inspections and stage-by-stage inspections are conducive to supplementing and revising the plan, making the plan continuously improve and truly play its role.

### 订技术革新规划是个好领导方法

    订技术革新规划是个好领导方法
    银川市各工厂在1960年的开头，普遍地制订了技术革新和技术革命规划，并且在这个基础上，初步订出了全市性的首季技术革新和技术革命规划。这标志着银川市的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，已经上升到了更有组织、更有领导的新阶段。
    各工厂在大搞技术革新和技术革命时，从没有计划到有计划，这是一个跃进。它说明了人们对于技术革新和技术革命的客观规律有了进一步的认识。技术革新必须适应新的形势，必须紧密结合生产；必须在突破了某个薄弱环节以后，使各道生产工序相应地进行全面的技术革新和技术革命，才能把整个生产水平提高一步。采取各种新的形式更有组织、更有计划地去领导技术革新和技术革命，是技术革新运动发展的必然结果，是迅速提高当前生产的客观要求。
    正确反映客观规律的措施，必然对客观实践发生指导作用。制订技术革新规划，就使我们在发展生产力的斗争中处于主动地位，因而也就会使这一斗争更有成效。制订规划，还可以促使我们在进行某种革新时，同时考虑到有关的另外一种革新，提前做好准备；也可以促使我们在研究和实现许许多多零星的技术革新建议的时候，方向明确，目标一致，更有先后主次和轻重缓急之分；也可以促使我们在研究群众的合理化建议时，更好地发现某些还没有被群众注意到的“空白点”，从而有意识地启发群众在这些方面大搞技术革新。总之，制定规划的办法，大大有利于各工厂在领导技术革新和技术革命时，事事主动，处处主动，时时主动。
    银川市各工厂的经验证明：技术革新和技术革命规划产生的过程，是进一步发动群众，调动群众大搞技术革新和技术革命积极性的过程。制订技术革新和技术革命规划的基础是群众提出的技术革新建议，通过制定和修改规划，认真地研究和采纳这些建议，并且动员群众的力量来实现这些建议，无疑的，这将推动群众提出更多的技术革新建议，加快各工厂向半机械化或机械化迈进的步伐。
    各个工厂有了技术革新和技术革命的规划以后，各级党的组织就必须进一步加强领导，从一个地区（县、市）或一个系统来综合平衡各工厂的规划，以便更快地提高整个地区或整个系统的生产水平。在工业生产建设中，不但某个生产过程的各道工序有密切关系，而且，各个工厂间也互相联系互相制约。这就要求各个工业生产领导部门通盘地考虑和指导技术革新和技术革命；制订一个地区或一个系统的技术革新和技术革命规划，就为我们通盘地考虑和指导技术革新和技术革命提供了许多方便，可以起到鼓舞先进，激励、带动后进的作用。
    制订技术革新和技术革命的规划，是一项使生产计划措施落实的好经验。完成先进计划的主要途径是大搞群众性的技术革新和技术革命。而制订技术革新和技术革命规划，实行定项目，定时间，定人员，定措施，定检查的“五定”制度，就更便于发挥群众的积极性和创造性。
    制订规划的目的是为了实现继续不断的跃进。因此，在有了规划以后，需要狠狠地抓紧检查、总结、评比，通过现场会、比武会、技术表演会等形式交流经验，检查规划的贯彻执行情况。有了正确的规划为依据，就要狠狠地抓紧不放，一抓到底。层层检查，段段检查，有利于补充修订规划，使规划不断完善起来，并真正发挥作用。　（摘自宁夏日报）
