The Wangdu People's Commune Fertilizer Plant in Tang County, Hebei, was established during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. In just over a year, the factory grew from small to large, from indigenous to foreign, becoming the center of the Wangdu People's Commune fertilizer network. Now, the factory has six workshops, forty-seven factory buildings, and sixty-two workers, capable of producing sixteen kinds of fertilizers and pesticides, with a daily output of 40,000 jin of fertilizer; the hydrochloric acid and ferrous sulfate produced have reached the quality level of commercial goods. Currently, except for the granular fertilizer workshop where the labor intensity is relatively high, most of the production processes for other fertilizers and pesticides have adopted mechanical operations.

		Started with Two Sieves
In early June 1958, with a lack of funds, no equipment, no experience, and no technical knowledge, the commune members started this fertilizer plant. At that time, lacking factory buildings, they temporarily borrowed two rooms from commune members; lacking tools, they borrowed four iron buckets from the supply and marketing cooperative, modified them, and bought two sieves, which were considered all the production tools; lacking technical knowledge, they sent people to the county granular fertilizer factory to learn; lacking raw materials, they mobilized the masses to collect them. Thus, after four days of preparation, they started production. Initially, they could only produce 4,000 jin of granular fertilizer per day; later, they gradually expanded to produce 20,000 jin of granular fertilizer per day.

After producing granular fertilizer, the workers began to study the production of bone meal. Because there was no bone smoking machine, the bones could not be degelatinized or degreased, making them difficult to crush. At the same time, the factory did not even have a single animal, relying solely on manual crushing, producing only 20 jin of bone meal per day. The difficulties did not scare these "peasants"; they looked for solutions everywhere and studied hard day and night, finally finding a trick from a doctor: corroding the bones with lime and plant ash made them easier to crush, greatly improving production efficiency. With the development of production, funds increased, and the factory bought a portable boiler, starting to use power to crush bones; however, manual sieving could not keep up. Ma Menghu, the director of the bone meal workshop, mobilized everyone to jointly research and successfully manufactured a power-driven automatic sieve, saving labor and increasing bone meal production to 2,000 jin per day.

		Foreign Fertilizer Made with Indigenous Methods
The Great Leap Forward in agricultural production required more varieties and better quality fertilizers. The fertilizer plant sent Hang Lianchi, who had received some schooling, to visit and study in other places; at the same time, it organized a technical research office and research groups, producing and researching simultaneously. After "learning from experience" and conducting their own research, they planned to trial-produce ammonium nitrate, phosphorus spraying solution, calcium superphosphate, and other fertilizers. Manufacturing these fertilizers required sulfuric acid. What to do? The workers built simple combustion furnaces, acid towers, and operating platforms. When producing the first batch of sulfuric acid, because there was no mother acid solution, sulfuric acid could not be produced. At this time, some people with conservative ideas began to doubt the indigenous methods; some even ridiculed, saying: "Is this just flowing without being acidic!" In response to this ideological situation, the Party branch proposed, "Is it possible not to use sulfuric acid mother liquor as a starter? How did the first drop of sulfuric acid in the world come about?" mobilizing everyone to launch a debate. Based on the principle that sulfuric acid can combine with water, they found a way to replace the mother liquor with water. The problem of mother acid was solved, but the locally produced ore contained little sulfur dioxide, so the temperature of the acid tower was low, and sulfuric acid could not be produced, only sulfur. After research, they added some coke to the ore to aid combustion and came up with the idea of using concentrated nitric water instead of nitric acid, solving the difficulties of low temperature and insufficient nitric acid during sulfuric acid production. After seven days and nights of deep drilling and hard work, sulfuric acid at 42 degrees finally came out of the furnace.

Hydrochloric acid is also a raw material needed for manufacturing fertilizer, so after producing sulfuric acid, they began to trial-produce hydrochloric acid. After research and experimentation, they made hydrochloric acid reaction pots. Because there were not many raw materials for making hydrochloric acid locally, they researched a method of using brine as a raw material to make hydrochloric acid. Every half jin of brine can produce one jin of high-quality hydrochloric acid, with the same quality as hydrochloric acid on the market.

Ferrous sulfate is both a fertilizer and a pesticide. After the factory produced hydrochloric acid, it began to trial-produce ferrous sulfate. Manufacturing this fertilizer requires acid-resistant pots and fire-resistant vats. They started by experimenting with ordinary pots, but the pots broke in three or two days. Later, everyone thought of heating tanks next to the furnace fire, which can make water hot, and based on this principle, they made "double-layered ferrous sulfate pots," heating inside the pot and adding acid inside the tank. This not only solved the problem of the lack of acid-resistant pots, but also improved product quality. According to tests by relevant departments, the ferrous sulfate produced by this method contains 96.7%.

		Produce Whatever is Needed
This factory takes the needs of agricultural production as a prerequisite, producing whatever crops need. Last spring, after wheat turned green, there was an urgent need for fast-acting fertilizer, so the fertilizer factory produced phosphorus spraying solution, calcium superphosphate, and other fertilizers, allowing the wheat to develop quickly; when cotton suffered from red spider mites, the factory first produced petroleum emulsion. In order to comprehensively and thoroughly defeat the insect pests, the workers also used the roots and leaves of locust trees, peach trees, ailanthus trees, and wild plants such as *Calystegia hederacea*, to trial-produce twelve kinds of indigenous pesticides, timely supporting the pest control battle.

		From 200 Yuan to 70,000 Yuan
Since the first day of its establishment, the Wangdu People's Commune Fertilizer Plant has always adhered to the principles of running the factory diligently and thriftily and relying on its own efforts. All of the current forty-seven factory buildings, except for the technically demanding tile and woodwork, were built by the workers themselves; some of the stoves used to produce fertilizer were also researched and built by the workers themselves. The factory cadres are not only commanders and service personnel, but also production combatants, eating, living, and working with the workers. Regarding raw materials, this factory made full use of waste materials and natural resources. When producing fertilizer, there was insufficient local bituminous coal, so the workers researched and modified the stoves, using anthracite coal instead of bituminous coal; they used the waste slag left over from steelmaking to replace the phosphorus raw materials for making indigenous fertilizer.

This fertilizer factory, which was just born more than a year ago, had an initial temporary investment of 200 yuan, and has now accumulated more than 70,000 yuan. It has transformed from being only able to produce granular fertilizer to a comprehensive fertilizer factory.

    庄稼人造出了洋化肥
    新华社记者　王炳奎　李玉山
    河北唐县望都人民公社化肥厂，是1958年大跃进中建立起来的。一年多的时间，这个厂由小到大，从土到洋，成为望都人民公社化肥网的中心。现在全厂已拥有六个车间，四十七间厂房和六十二名工人，能生产化肥和农药十六种，日产化肥四万斤；生产的盐酸和硫酸亚铁，质量已经达到市场商品的水平。目前除颗粒肥料车间劳动强度较大外，其它化肥农药的生产过程，大部已采用机械操作。
        从两张筛子办起
    1958年6月初，社员们在缺少资金、没有设备、毫无经验、不懂技术的情况下，办起了这个化肥厂。当时没有厂房，就临时借了社员两间屋；没有工具，向供销社借了四个铁桶，自己改造了一下，又买了两个筛子，算是全部生产工具；不懂技术，便派人到县颗粒肥料厂学习；没有原料，就发动群众采集。这样，经过四天筹备就投入了生产。开始，每天只能生产四千斤颗粒肥料；后来，逐步扩大到每天能生产两万斤颗粒肥料。
    生产颗粒肥料以后，工人们就开始研究制造骨粉。因为没有熏骨机，骨头既不能脱胶，又不能出油，因而不易粉碎。同时厂里连一匹牲口也没有，只靠人力粉碎，每天只能生产二十斤骨粉。困难没有吓倒这些“庄稼人”，他们到处找办法，日夜苦钻研，终于从一个医生那里找到了窍门：把骨头用石灰和草木灰腐蚀一下，就容易粉碎了，生产效率大大提高。随着生产的发展，资金增加了，厂里买了锅驼机，开始利用动力粉碎骨头；可是人力摇箩却赶不上了。骨粉车间主任麻梦虎发动大家共同研究，制造成功了一个动力带动的自动箩，节约了劳力，骨粉生产达到了日产二千斤。
        土法制成洋化肥
    农业生产大跃进，需要品种更多、质量更好的化肥。化肥厂便派出念过几天书的杭连池到外地参观学习；同时组织技术研究室和研究组，边生产，边研究。经过“取经”和自己研究，便计划试制硝酸铵、喷磷液、过磷酸钙等化肥。制造这些化肥都需要硫酸，怎么办？工人们修建起简易的燃烧炉、酸塔和操作台。当生产第一炉硫酸时，因为没有母酸液，生产不出硫酸来。这时一些有保守思想的人，对土法产生了怀疑；也有的人讥笑说：“这是只流不酸了吧！”党支部针对这种思想情况，提出“不用硫酸母液做引子行不行？天下第一滴硫酸是怎样来的？”发动大家展开辩论。大家根据硫酸能与水化合的道理，找出了以水代替母液的办法。母酸问题解决了，可是本地产的矿石含二氧化硫少，所以酸塔温度低，成不了硫酸，只能制成硫磺。经过研究，在矿石中加些焦炭助燃，并想出了用浓硝水代替硝酸的办法，解决了温度低和制硫酸时硝酸不足的困难。经过七昼夜的深钻苦干，四十二度的硫酸终于出炉了。
    盐酸也是制造化肥需要的原料，所以在制成硫酸后，又开始试制盐酸。大家经过钻研试验，制成了盐酸反应锅。当地制盐酸的原料不多，又研究出用卤水做原料制盐酸的方法，每一斤半卤水可生产一斤优质盐酸，和市场上的盐酸质量一样。
    硫酸亚铁既是化肥，又是农药。厂里制成盐酸以后，又开始试制硫酸亚铁。制造这种化肥需要耐酸锅和耐火缸。开始用普通锅试验了一下，三两天锅就坏了。后来大家想到炉火旁加温罐，能使水变热，便根据这种道理，制成了“硫酸亚铁双层锅”，锅内加热，罐内加酸。这样，不但解决了缺少耐酸锅的问题，同时提高了产品质量。据有关部门化验，这种方法制出的硫酸亚铁，含亚铁96．7％。
        需要什么制什么
    这个厂以农业生产的需要为前提，作物需要什么，厂里便生产什么。去年春天小麦返青后，急需速效化肥，化肥厂就生产了喷磷液、过磷酸钙等化肥，使小麦很快发育起来；棉花发生了红蜘蛛，厂里首先生产了石油乳剂。为了全面彻底战胜虫灾，工人们还利用槐树、桃树、椿树的根和叶，以及打碗棵等野草，试制成十二种土农药，及时支援了除虫战役。
        从二百元到七万元
    望都人民公社化肥厂自建厂的第一天起，始终坚持勤俭办厂、自力更生的原则。现在的四十七间厂房，除技术性强的瓦木活计外，全是工人自己动手建成的；一些生产化肥用的炉灶，也都是工人自己研究建造的。厂里的干部既是指挥员、服务员，又是生产战斗员，他们和工人们同吃同住同劳动。在原料问题上，这个厂充分利用了废物和自然资源。在生产化肥时，当地烟煤不足，工人们便研究改灶，用白煤代替烟煤；利用炼钢铁剩下的废碴子，代替制土化肥的磷素原料。
    这个刚刚诞生一年多的化肥厂，建厂时的临时投资是二百元，现在已积累到七万多元。从只能生产颗粒肥料，变成了一座综合性的化肥工厂。
