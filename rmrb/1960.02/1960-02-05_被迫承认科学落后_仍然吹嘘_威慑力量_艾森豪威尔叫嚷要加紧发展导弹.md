Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 4th Dispatch: U.S. President Eisenhower reluctantly admitted at a press conference on the 3rd that the Soviet Union has greatly surpassed the United States in many areas, including science and technology. He clamored that the United States should step up its efforts, especially to accelerate the development of ballistic missiles, in order to change its backward position.

A reporter pointed out to Eisenhower that in recent congressional testimonies on the balance of power between the Soviet Union and the United States, many speakers believed that the United States was far behind the Soviet Union in missile development and had little or no hope of catching up. The reporter asked Eisenhower what his opinion was on this statement.

In response, Eisenhower tried to appear calm, saying that he was "a little surprised" by the talk of catching up with the Soviet Union and boasted that the United States possessed a so-called "sufficient" "deterrent power." At the same time, he emphasized that the U.S. government is now particularly committed to the development of intercontinental and intermediate-range missiles, and that its appropriation for various missiles in 1960 "has reached a point where money itself cannot further accelerate the pace of development."

Speaking of the exploration of outer space, Eisenhower said that, in his opinion, the Soviet Union is "far ahead in the manufacture of very large boosters and engines" for exploring outer space. "Therefore, in terms of long-distance space exploration, the Soviet Union will be ahead for some time, because it takes time to manufacture that kind of engine." He said that the United States also "needs to formulate an appropriate and suitable scientific exploration plan and actively implement it, instead of always trying to follow behind others" in exploring outer space.

Another reporter pointed out to Eisenhower that the Soviet Union may have more missiles than the United States. The Soviet Union has already defeated the United States in flying to the moon. The Soviet Union's economic growth rate is currently faster than that of the United States, and it is cultivating more trained engineers than the United States. He asked Eisenhower whether these factors, taken together, might not create a state of mind that forces us to admit that we are relegated to second place in everything? In answering this question, Eisenhower tried to avoid the far-reaching significance of these facts, but he had to admit, "You can find everywhere that, compared to a country as large as the Soviet Union, you will certainly be relegated to second place in this or that aspect; didn't they win in the last Olympic Games?" He then issued shameless slanders against the Soviet socialist system, saying that the Soviet Union's achievements were achieved under so-called "dictatorial rule" and were exaggerated by the American newspapers. He said, "The efficiency of dictatorship has always been very high... If you take our country, make it a barracks, and organize it, for a period of time, you can... go at a much greater speed than we are doing now." He called on the American people to have "confidence" in the capitalist system.

Someone asked Eisenhower what he thought of Soviet Premier Khrushchev's statement that the Soviet Union intends to conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic. Eisenhower replied that Khrushchev had said such things at Camp David and elsewhere, and that the Soviet Union had the right to conclude a separate treaty with the German Democratic Republic. But he then threatened that if the signing of such a treaty separated West Berlin from the West, it would create "a very serious situation."

In answering another question, Eisenhower said that he "didn't know any Camp David spirit." He said, "I have heard people quote this word several times, and I think the people who quote this word are—I mean, the people who quoted this word first were not us."

Eisenhower also said at the press conference that he advocated that the United States tell the military secrets of the production of those types of atomic and hydrogen weapons that the Soviets already knew to the "allies" who "firmly stand with" the United States against communism. He said that "for the benefit of the United States," the U.S. Congress should make corresponding amendments to the current laws prohibiting the disclosure of atomic secrets to U.S. allies. He indicated that one of the purposes of his proposal was to further arm the U.S. military "allies."

    被迫承认科学落后　仍然吹嘘“威慑力量”
    艾森豪威尔叫嚷要加紧发展导弹
    新华社4日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔3日在记者招待会上无可奈何地承认，苏联在科学技术等许多方面大大超过了美国。他叫嚷美国要加紧努力，特别是加紧发展弹道导弹，以改变它所处的落后地位。
    有记者向艾森豪威尔指出，在最近美国国会关于苏美力量对比的作证中，许多发言的人都认为美国在导弹发展方面大大落后于苏联，而且很少有或者没有赶上的希望。记者问艾森豪威尔，他对于这种说法有什么意见。
    艾森豪威尔在回答时一方面强作镇静，说什么他对于要赶上苏联的谈论“有点感到惊讶”，并且大肆吹嘘美国拥有所谓“足够的”“威慑力量”。同时，他强调说：美国政府现在已特别致力于发展洲际导弹和中程导弹，它在1960年为各种导弹的拨款“已接近于金钱本身不能再加快速度，加速发展的地步了”。
    在谈到外层空间的探索时，艾森豪威尔说，在他看来，苏联在制造探索外层空间的“非常大的推进器和引擎方面是遥遥领先的，因此就远距离空间探索来说，苏联将在这方面领先若干时候，因为制造那种引擎是需要时间的”。他说，在探索外层空间方面，美国也“要制订一个适当的和适宜的科学探索计划，并且积极地执行这个计划，而不是老是想跟在别人后面。”
    又有记者向艾森豪威尔指出，苏联可能拥有比美国多的导弹。苏联已经在飞向月球方面打败了美国。苏联目前经济增长的速度比美国快，它正在培养出比美国更多的有训练的工程师。他问艾森豪威尔，这些因素加在一起来说，难道不可能在形成一种思想状态，使我们处在或者被迫处在承认在一切方面退居第二的地位吗？艾森豪威尔在回答这个问题时竭力回避这些事实的深远意义，但是他不得不承认，“你们到处都可以发现，跟像苏联那样大的一个国家比，在这方面或那方面你们肯定会退居第二的；他们在上次的奥林匹克运动会中不是赢了吗？”他接着又对苏联的社会主义制度发出无耻的污蔑，说什么苏联的成就是在所谓“独裁统治”下取得的，并且是被美国报纸夸大了的。他说，“独裁统治的效率一直是很高的……如果你拿下我们的国家使它成为一个兵营，并把它组织起来，在一个时期中，你能够……比我们现在所做的速度大得多。”他叫美国人民对资本主义制度要有“信心”。
    有人问艾森豪威尔对苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫关于苏联打算同德意志民主共和国缔结和约的声明有什么看法。艾森豪威尔回答说，赫鲁晓夫在戴维营和其他地方都说过这样的话，苏联有权同德意志民主共和国缔结一项单独的条约。但是他接着又威胁说，如果签订这种条约使西柏林脱离西方的话，那样就会造成“一个非常严重的局面”。
    艾森豪威尔在回答另一个问题时说，他“不知道任何戴维营精神”，他说，“我好几次听到过有人引用这个字眼，我认为引用这个字眼的人是——我是说首先引用这个字眼的人并不是我们。”
    艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上还说，他主张美国把苏联人已经知道的那些类型的原子武器和氢武器的生产的秘密情报告诉同美国“坚决站在一起”反共的“盟国”。他说，“为了美国的利益”，美国国会应当对目前禁止把原子秘密告诉美国盟国的法令作相应的修改。他表明，他这个主张的目的之一是要进一步武装美国的军事“盟国”。
