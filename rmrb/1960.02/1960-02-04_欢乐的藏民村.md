    Happy Tibetan Village
    By our reporters Yang Liben and Li Qiping
    Xiapai is a small village inhabited by Tibetan farmers in Qinghai Province. Here, the population is growing and production is increasing. The whole village is filled with joy. Every morning after breakfast, mothers carry their babies to the nursery, and the older children, like a flock of chattering birds, carry their small schoolbags, singing and dancing to the primary school and kindergarten. During the day, the adults are all working in the fields. In the village, only the sounds of children reading, singing, and playing can be heard, and from the fields, melodious Tibetan folk songs are heard from time to time.
    Xiapai Village, this small Tibetan village that suffered unspeakable humiliation and suffering in the old society, how can it not be filled with joy and song and dance today, with its growing population and successive years of good harvests!
    The village is very close to Guide County. Before liberation, Ma Bufang's bandit troops ruled Qinghai. The bandit army officers and soldiers stationed in the county often came here to drink, make trouble, and bully women. In the era of extremely cruel national oppression, the Tibetan people dared to be angry but did not dare to speak. Later, the bandit army officers and soldiers simply regarded Xiapai as their place of debauchery, often breaking into residents' homes to rape and molest women. Many people could not bear the bullying and humiliation. Some quietly jumped into the Yellow River, and some went to the grasslands to wander. The bandit army's ravages and oppression made the villagers live in extreme poverty and suffer from serious diseases. Before liberation, about 90% of the young and middle-aged men and women in the village were infected with venereal diseases such as gonorrhea and syphilis. There was also a kind of scabies called "Gelu" in Tibetan, which was prevalent among men, women, old and young. The diseases not only made many people toss and turn in bed, unable to participate in labor, but more seriously, made most of the young and middle-aged men and women lose their fertility, and the population of the village decreased year by year. The elderly in the village told us sadly that in the old society, Xiapai Village had three more and one miserable: more bandit soldiers, more venereal diseases, more garbage, and the misery of women being ravaged by Ma Bufang's army. By the time of liberation, there were only sixty-seven households and two hundred and seventy-eight people in the village, and thirty-one of them had no descendants. In the six years from 1943 to 1949, the whole village only gave birth to fourteen babies, eight of whom died as soon as they were born. The elderly worried day and night: in a few decades, there would be no one left in Xiapai Village.
    In the autumn of 1949, the evil bandit army was completely wiped out by the People's Liberation Army. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, the people of Xiapai Village vigorously developed production and various constructions. Grain production increased year by year, and the yield per mu increased from about one hundred jin before liberation to more than three hundred and twenty jin last year. The improvement and enhancement of economic life made people's lives stable and their moods happy. In order to relieve the long-term suffering of the people of Xiapai Village from diseases, the Party and the government led them to vigorously carry out health work and prevent and treat venereal diseases for them. From 1951 to last year, in addition to the Guide County People's Hospital regularly sending people here to prevent and treat venereal diseases, the central government, the province, and the autonomous prefecture have also sent venereal disease prevention and treatment teams seven times to conduct free examinations, treatments, and re-examinations. The largest scale was in 1954, when several work teams lived in the village for several months and conducted comprehensive prevention and treatment for all the residents, eliminating manifest venereal diseases in one fell swoop. From that year on, the number of women giving birth to babies in the village gradually increased. Now, the population of the whole village has increased from 278 at the beginning of liberation to 361, a net increase of about 30%, of which 112 children were newly added after liberation. In 1957 alone, thirty-seven babies were born. Because venereal diseases were eradicated, some women in their thirties and forties who had never given birth also became pregnant, and many families who had lamented "destined to be extinct" before liberation also had descendants.
    The grassroots Party organization in Xiapai is very concerned about women's health care. As early as the period of agricultural cooperatives, it was stipulated that when assigning work to women, "dry work should be assigned during menstruation, light work should be assigned during pregnancy, and near work should be assigned during breastfeeding." Now, as a team of the Hexi People's Commune, Xiapai has its own nursery, kindergarten, primary school, and maternity hospital. Most of the school-age children have been admitted to the nursery and kindergarten. In the old society, Tibetan women could not give birth at home and had to go to the livestock pens to raise children, breaking the umbilical cord with stones themselves. Now, they all come to the maternity hospital for childbirth, and the midwives are responsible for taking care of them. There are two new-style midwives in the village, who conduct prenatal examinations for all pregnant women and visit them seven to ten days after delivery. If there is a difficult labor that cannot be resolved, they ask the midwife from the commune health center to help.
    Under the close care of the Party and the government, venereal diseases in Xiapai Village have been basically eliminated. Now, among the sixty-odd women of childbearing age in the village, except for a few who were too badly ravaged by diseases in the old society, the rest have healthy babies. After liberation, almost every household has added population. As soon as you arrive in the village, you can see groups of strong children jumping and playing everywhere. Xiapai Village is now not only thriving, but also because the health of the residents is improving day by day, and labor efficiency is constantly improving, which has also promoted the development of production. At the beginning of liberation, many young and middle-aged people in the village could not work in the fields due to illness. When the elementary cooperative was established in 1955, the labor force attendance rate could only reach about 72%. Now, the daily attendance rate is maintained at over 95%. In these happy days of thriving population and bumper harvests and increased income, how can the Tibetan people who are good at singing and dancing not use songs and dances to express their inner joy! They sing:
    The Yellow River flows eastward and never returns,
    The shame and disaster are gone forever.
    The Communist Party and Chairman Mao,
    Have brought us spring.
    The song of gratitude is like a long stream of water,
    Never ending, never finished.

    欢乐的藏民村
    本报记者　杨立本　李启平
    下排，是青海省一个藏族农民聚居的小村，这里是家增人口地增产，全村喜气洋洋，每天早饭后，妈妈们抱着娃娃送托儿所，大一些的孩子就像一群群吱吱喳喳的小鸟，提着小书包边唱边跳地走向小学和幼儿园。白天，大人们都在田间劳动，村子里只听到孩子们的读书声、唱歌声和喧闹声，田野里不时传来阵阵悠扬的藏族民歌声。
    下排村，这个在旧社会蒙受着难言的耻辱和苦难的藏族小村，在人丁兴旺、连年丰收的今天，怎么能够不欢乐歌舞啊！
    村子离贵德县城很近，解放前马匪步芳统治青海，驻在县城的匪军官兵常到这儿来酗酒取闹，欺凌妇女。在民族压迫极端残酷的年代里，藏族人民敢怒而不敢言。后来，马匪官兵竟干脆把下排当作他们的淫乐场所，经常闯进居民家中，奸淫调戏妇女。多少人受不住欺凌和耻辱，有的悄悄跳进了黄河，有的到草原上去流浪了。匪军的蹂躏压迫，使村民过着极为贫困的生活，受到严重疾病的折磨。解放以前，村里有90％左右的青壮年男女传染上了淋病、梅毒等性病，还有一种藏语名叫“格鲁”的疥疮，普遍地在男女老少中流行。疾病不仅使许多人辗转床褥，不能参加劳动，更严重的是使大部分青壮年男女丧失生育能力，全村人口一年比一年减少。村里的老年人悲痛地告诉我们说，在旧社会，下排村有三多一惨：匪军多、性病多、垃圾多，妇女被马匪军糟踏的惨。到解放时，村中只有六十七户，二百七十八人，而且有三十一家没有后代。在1943年到1949年六年多中，全村只生养了十四个娃娃，其中有八个一生下来就死了。老年人日夜忧虑地念叨：再过几十年，下排村就没有人了。
    1949年秋天，无恶不作的匪军被人民解放军彻底消灭了，党和政府领导下排村人民大搞生产和各项建设，粮食产量一年比一年增加，亩产从解放前的一百来斤提高到去年的三百二十多斤。经济生活的改善和提高，使人民生活安定，心情舒畅。为了解除下排村人民长期所受的疾病痛苦，党和政府领导他们大力开展卫生工作和给他们防治性病。从1951年到去年，除了贵德县人民医院经常派人在这里防治性病以外，中央、省、自治州还先后七次派来防治性病的工作队，进行免费检查、治疗和复查。规模最大的一次是1954年，好几个工作队在村里住了几个月，对全村居民作了全面的防治，一举消灭了显发性的性病。从这一年起，村里生养娃娃的妇女就逐渐多了起来。现在，全村的人口已由解放初期的二百七十八人增加到三百六十一人，净增加30％左右，其中解放以后新添的孩子就有一百一十二个。1957年一年当中，就新生了三十七个娃娃。由于扑灭了性病，一些三、四十岁从未生育过的妇女也怀了胎，许多解放前悲叹“命该绝后”的人家，也有了后人。
    下排的基层党组织十分关心妇女保健工作，早在农业合作社时期就规定，给妇女派活时“在经期派干不派湿，在孕期派轻不派重，在哺乳期派近不派远”。现在，作为河西人民公社的一个小队，下排已有自己的托儿所、幼儿园、小学和产院。适龄儿童绝大部分都入所入园了。在旧社会，藏族妇女不能在家中生育，必须到牲口圈棚里去养娃，自己用石头砸断脐带。如今，她们生养时都到产院来，由接生员负责照顾。村中有两个新法接生员，她们对所有的产妇都做到产前检查，产后七天到十天探视，遇有不能解决的难产就请公社卫生院的助产士来帮助处理。
    在党和政府的亲切关怀下，下排村的性病已经基本上消灭了，现在全村六十多个正在生育年龄的妇女，除了有几个人因为在旧社会被疾病摧残得太厉害以外，其余都有了胖娃娃。解放以后，差不多每户都增添了人口。一到村子里，到处都可以看到一群群壮实的孩子在蹦蹦跳跳。下排村现在不仅人丁兴旺，而且由于居民健康情况一天天好转，劳动效率不断提高，也促进了生产的发展。解放初期，村里的许多青壮年因病不能到田间劳动，1955年建立初级合作社时，劳动力出勤还只能达到72％左右，现在，每天的出勤率都保持在95％以上。在这人丁兴旺、丰产增收的幸福日子里，能歌善舞的藏族人民怎么能不用歌舞来表达他们内心的欢乐啊！他们歌唱：
    黄河流水一去不回头，
    耻辱与灾难永远过去了。
    共产党和毛主席，
    给我们带来了春天。
    感恩的歌声像一脉长流水，
    永远流不尽，唱不完。
