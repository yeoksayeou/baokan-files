Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 3rd. The Southern Xinjiang Archaeological Team of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Museum, while excavating an ancient site next to the Niya River in Minfeng County in the southern part of the Taklamakan Desert, unearthed a pair of mummified bodies of a man and a woman buried together. Based on the clothing and funerary objects of the deceased, these mummies are likely figures from nearly two thousand years ago, during the Eastern Han Dynasty (1st to 3rd century AD). This provides valuable information for studying ancient anthropology, the history of East-West communication, and ethnic relations in the southern Tarim Basin.

From the fact that the two mummies were lying side by side in a coffin, it can be inferred that the deceased were a married couple. Their faces, chests, abdomens, and limbs are all intact. Both are pillowed on red woolen ingot-shaped pillows and covered with fine silk over their bodies and faces. The wife, covered with yellow silk on the left, had her braided hair under her head, and beside her head was a rattan box commonly used in southern China, containing a bronze mirror inscribed with "May Your Lordship Be Promoted to High Office" in seal script, a silk embroidered powder bag, a wooden comb, sewing tools, and other women's items. The husband, covered with green silk on the right, had a 1.2-meter-long wooden bow and a wooden quiver on his body, the quiver containing four arrow shafts without arrowheads, and wooden bowls, wooden cups, and pottery jars as funerary objects at his feet, all of which were intact. Judging from the high nose bridge and large cheekbones of the mummies, especially the woman's braided hairstyle, the deceased belonged to the local ethnic group. Moreover, judging from the exquisite clothing and rich funerary objects, the deceased were members of the local ruling class.

The discovery of these two mummies proves that the Han and various ethnic groups in Xinjiang formed a brotherly friendship very early on in the history of the unified motherland. The brocade robes, brocade socks, various fine silks, and many artifacts worn by the deceased were all products of the interior. In particular, the man's red-bottomed brocade robe was woven with "May you live ten thousand years as you wish" and "Prolong life and benefit descendants" in clerical script, indicating that it was transported from the interior to Xinjiang. The woman's funerary objects, such as the rattan box, the "May Your Lordship Be Promoted to High Office" bronze mirror, and other items, were no different from those used by the Han people. According to archaeologists, the Southern Silk Road (i.e., the present-day Ruoqiang, Minfeng, and Hotan area) during the Eastern Han Dynasty was an important route for East-West communication, and the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang had frequent interactions with the interior, resulting in a flourishing cultural exchange.

The mummies were dressed in various colors of silk clothes, and even the socks and sock bands were made of patterned brocade and embroidery. Han Dynasty brocade and silk were special products of our country and also major export commodities. Very little of the silk and brocade from that time has survived to this day. However, most of the clothes of these two mummies are still intact, except for the parts under their bodies that have rotted. The patterns and colors of the brocade robes are still clear and bright.

The original residence of the mummies, the ancient city of Niya, actually had no city walls but was a cluster of houses scattered in a star-like pattern, 14 kilometers long from north to south and 2 kilometers wide from east to west. The Niya River flowed from the south of the city. To complete the investigation of this ancient city site, the archaeological workers set off from the Hongqi Commune of Minfeng County in October last year and traveled through the desert on camels for three days to reach their destination. After more than ten days of hard work, in addition to the two mummies, they also discovered more than sixty "Kharosthi" wooden slips, unopened wooden tablets, Han Dynasty "Wu Zhu" coins, and pottery artifacts.

Currently, the pair of mummies, along with the coffin, have been transported to Urumqi City for further study.

    南疆发现一对木乃伊
    死者衣着和很多用品都是内地产物，证明汉族和新疆各族人民在两千年前就结成了兄弟友谊
    新华社乌鲁木齐3日电  新疆维吾尔自治区博物馆南疆考古队，在塔克拉玛干大沙漠南部探掘民丰县尼雅河旁一座古代遗址时，发掘出一对男女合葬的“木乃伊”。从死者衣着和殉葬物考察，这对“木乃伊”可能是距今近二千年、东汉时代（公元一至三世纪）的人物，它对研究塔里木南部地区古代人种学、中西交通历史、民族关系等问题提供了珍贵的资料。
    从两具“木乃伊”并卧在一口棺木里的情况看，死者是一对夫妻。他们的面部、胸腹和四肢都很完整。两人都枕着红色毛织元宝形枕头，全身和面部用细绸复盖。左边盖黄绸的妻子，辫发枕在头下，头旁放着一个我国南方常用的藤条编的奁盒，内有一面用篆体书写着“君宜高官”的铜镜、绸制绣花粉袋、木梳、线具等妇女用品；右边盖绿绸的丈夫，身上放着一张一米二十厘米长的木弓和木箭筒，筒内装着四支没有镞的箭杆，脚下摆着木碗、木杯和陶罐等殉葬物，都很完整。从“木乃伊”的鼻梁很高、颧骨大的特点，特别是女的多辫发型看来，死者是属于当地民族的，而且从衣着的讲究、殉葬品的丰富看来，死者还是当地的统治阶级人物。
    这两具“木乃伊”的发现，证明汉族与新疆各民族很早在祖国统一的历史中就结成了兄弟友谊。死者所穿的锦袍、锦袜和各色细绸以及很多用品都是内地的产物，特别是从男“木乃伊”身穿的那件红底花锦袍上织着“万世如意”、“延年益寿宜子孙”等隶书看来，是由内地运到新疆的；女“木乃伊”殉葬品如藤奁、“君宜高官”铜镜和汉族人用品无异。据考古工作者推测，东汉时代南丝道（即今若羌、民丰、和田一带）是中西交通要道，新疆各民族与内地交往频繁，文化交流很盛。
    “木乃伊”穿着各色丝绸衣服，甚至连袜子袜带都是花锦和刺绣的。汉代花锦和丝绸是我国特产，也是出口大宗。当时的丝绸和花锦能够保存到今天的已经非常稀少。而这两个“木乃伊”的衣服除在身下部分已经腐烂外，大部分都还完好，锦袍的花纹和色泽还很清晰、鲜艳。
    “木乃伊”原来居住地尼雅古城，实际上没有城墙，只是一丛一丛作星散状的房屋群，南北长十四公里，东西宽二公里，尼雅河从城南流过。考古工作者为了完成对这座古城遗址的考察，他们在去年10月间从民丰县红旗公社出发，骑着骆驼在沙漠中跋涉了三天才到达目的地。经过十多天的艰苦工作，除发掘出两具“木乃伊”外，还发现了六十多个“佉卢文”木简、未启封的木牍、汉代“五铢”钱以及陶器等文物。
    现在，这对“木乃伊”连同棺木已运到乌鲁木齐市，作进一步研究。
