Xinhua News Agency, February 25th: Like other education endeavors in our country, art education has achieved remarkable results in both the quantitative development and the improvement of teaching quality in the past two years, thanks to the earnest implementation of the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics, combining education with productive labor" and the "walking on two legs" approach to running schools.

Our country's art education undertaking shoulders the important task of cultivating working-class art cadres with socialist consciousness, cultural and artistic accomplishment. Since 1958, in order to adapt to the great development of industrial and agricultural production and the growing needs of workers, peasants, and soldiers for culture and art, cultural and art schools in various places have developed accordingly. According to recent statistics, there are currently 34 higher cultural and art schools nationwide with majors in music, fine arts, drama, opera, film, etc.; 66 secondary cultural and art schools above the provincial and municipal levels. The number of these schools has more than doubled compared to 1957; the number of students enrolled has also exceeded twice the number of students enrolled in 1957. Many special districts have established secondary art schools, and many art professional organizations and enterprises have also attached art schools and training classes. At the same time, all parts of the country have also held a large number of amateur cultural and art schools and short-term training courses according to the needs of the masses and the conditions of teachers, and have cultivated a large number of backbones for mass cultural and artistic activities.

After the rectification and anti-rightist struggles, especially after the implementation of the Party's education policy, the thoughts and feelings of teachers and students in art colleges across the country have undergone significant changes. In the past, some teachers and students in art schools despised physical labor, despised the laboring people, and even held the idea of art for art's sake, which has been greatly changed. Many teachers and students have established the idea of working selflessly for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and for the socialist cause. They unite and help each other in their work, and are able to endure hardship and stand hard work. Teachers and students from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts, Xi'an Academy of Fine Arts, and the Fine Arts Department of Nanjing Academy of Arts often go deep into the countryside to help the masses paint murals, which has encouraged the political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the peasants. Through labor training, all teachers and students in art colleges have come into contact with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and have gradually gained a deeper understanding of the significance of art serving politics and serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. The tendency of separating from politics, reality, and the masses in art teaching has also been fundamentally changed.

In the past two years, art colleges have implemented the Party's education policy and carried out a great revolution in art education, which has significantly improved the quality of art teaching. During their time in the countryside, students from the Central Conservatory of Music created excellent works such as the "People's Commune Chorus" and the "Youth Piano Concerto" with rich national musical characteristics, which have been well received by all sectors of society. Students from the Shanghai Conservatory of Music created the "Happiness River Chorus," which is highly ideological and artistic, during their labor at the northern Jiangsu water conservancy construction site. It was extremely popular with the masses when it was performed at the water conservancy construction site, and it was also well received by audiences from various countries when it was performed at the 7th World Youth Festival. In the past two years, students from the Central Academy of Fine Arts have paid attention to linking with reality, attached importance to creation activities, and generally improved their creative abilities. A number of outstanding works have appeared in the revolutionary historical paintings, murals, and monument sculptures created for museums in 1959. The work "City in the Forest" by students of the Printmaking Department also won the gold medal at the 7th World Youth Festival.

    艺术教育两年有了大变化
    学校数目增加一倍多  教学质量显著提高
    据新华社25日讯　我国艺术教育事业和其他教育事业一样，近两年来由于认真贯彻了党的“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育和生产劳动相结合”的方针和“两条腿走路”的办学方针，各类艺术学校无论在数量发展或教学质量的提高方面，都获得了显著的成绩。
    我国艺术教育事业担负着培养有社会主义觉悟，有文化、艺术修养的工人阶级艺术干部的重大任务。1958年以来，为适应工农业生产大发展和工农群众对文化艺术需要的日益增长，各地文化艺术学校都有了相适应的发展。据最近统计：目前全国已有音乐、美术、话剧、戏曲、电影等科的高等文化艺术学校三十四所；省、市以上的中等文化艺术学校六十六所。这些学校数量比1957年增加了一倍多；在校学生人数也超过1957年在校学生数的二倍。很多专区建立了中等艺术学校，很多艺术专业团体和企业单位也附设了艺术学校和学员班。同时，全国各地根据群众需要和师资条件，还举办了大量的业余文化艺术学校和短期训练班，培养了大量群众文艺活动的骨干。
    经过整风和反右倾斗争，特别是贯彻了党的教育方针以后，全国艺术院校师生们思想感情起了显著的变化。过去一部分艺术学校师生轻视体力劳动、轻视劳动人民，甚至为艺术而艺术的思想，有了很大转变。许多师生树立了为工农群众、为社会主义事业忘我劳动的思想，他们在工作中团结互助，吃苦耐劳。中央美术学院、浙江美术学院、西安美术专科学校、南京艺术学院美术系等校的师生，经常深入农村，帮助群众画壁画，鼓舞了农民的政治热情和生产热情。所有艺术院校的师生通过劳动锻炼，接触了工农劳动群众，对艺术为政治服务，为工农兵服务的意义，已逐渐有了较深刻的认识。在艺术教学中脱离政治、脱离实际、脱离群众的倾向，也得到了根本的改变。
    两年来，各艺术院校贯彻党的教育方针，实行艺术教育大革命，使艺术教学的质量有了显著提高。中央音乐学院的学生在下乡期间，创作了获得各界好评的“人民公社大合唱”和富有民族音乐色彩的“青年钢琴协奏曲”等优秀作品。上海音乐学院的学生在苏北水利工地劳动中，创作了思想性、艺术性都较高的“幸福河大合唱”，在水利工地演出时，极受群众欢迎，在第七届世界青年联欢节上演出时，也得到各国听众的好评。中央美术学院学生在这两年中，注意了联系实际，重视创作活动，创作能力普遍提高。1959年为博物馆创作的革命历史画、壁画、纪念碑雕塑等作品中，出现了一批出色的作品。版画系的学生的作品“森林中的城市”，还获得第七届世界青年联欢节的金质奖章。
