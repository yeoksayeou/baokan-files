Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, February 1st: Many factories and mining enterprises in Chongqing achieved outstanding results on the first day of production after the Spring Festival holiday.

    The Chongqing Chang'an Machine Factory, which had completed its January production tasks ahead of schedule, exceeded its total output value plan for the day by 115% on the first day after the holiday. The factory's employees proposed more than 8,600 innovation suggestions in one day and implemented more than 7,900 of them. Wei Gaohou, a miller and nationally renowned technical innovation expert at this factory, implemented 22 innovation suggestions on the first day after the holiday, increasing work efficiency by as much as 720 times at the highest and three times at the lowest. At the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory, several groups completed their entire February workload on the first day after the holiday. The Clever Girls Team of the 24th workshop of this factory originally produced springs, with each person producing only over a hundred pieces per hour. On the first day after the holiday, before dawn, the girls came to the workshop, made all the preparations, and then held a meeting to propose completing the entire February task in two days. They modified grinding wheels and made automatic steel wire cutters themselves, greatly improving efficiency. They completed the entire February plan in just one day. Textile workers at the Chongqing Silk Textile Factory launched a technical performance competition immediately after returning to work after the holiday, thus exceeding the day's output value plan by 10.52%.

    Employees of the Zhongliangshan and Tianfu coal mines proposed "Don't slack off before or after the festival, have a high-yield and safe Spring Festival" during the Spring Festival, which made the production steadily rise in the battle of coal and coke acquisition. The production of coal and coke greatly exceeded the level of the three days before the festival.
