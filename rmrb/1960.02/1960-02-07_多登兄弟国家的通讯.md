    More Communications from Fraternal Countries
    Recently, the People's Daily has continuously published communications reports from fraternal countries. These communications reflect that the socialist camp countries are all developing production and construction at a high speed, presenting a thriving scene everywhere. Some communications portray the spiritual outlook of advanced figures, which is deeply moving. Such as the Vietnam communication "A Heart of Loyalty for the Revolution," and the Soviet communication "Gold Star Hero Livestock Breeder." In "Gold Star Hero Livestock Breeder," a quote from Petukhova is cited: "Our experience has only one point: whether raising cattle or pigs, the livestock breeder must first establish the idea of loving livestock as if they were children... Any kind of work can achieve good results as long as people wholeheartedly love their work and engage in labor creatively." Simple sentences are full of rich truths, which will greatly inspire everyone engaged in socialist construction.
    It is suggested that the People's Daily publish more communications from fraternal countries in the future, and continue to expand the scope of reporting.

    多登兄弟国家的通讯
    最近以来，人民日报连续刊登了兄弟国家的通讯报道。这些通讯反映出社会主义阵营各国都以高速度发展着生产建设，到处呈现出欣欣向荣的景象。有的通讯刻画了先进人物的精神面貌，使人深受感动。如越南通讯“一片丹心为革命”，苏联通讯“金星英雄饲养员”就是这样。“金星英雄饲养员”中引用了彼多霍娃的一句话：“我们的经验只有一条：不管是养牛也好，养猪也好，对饲养员来说，首先必须树立爱畜如子的思想……任何一种工作都能获得好成绩，只要人们全心全意热爱自己的工作，创造性地从事劳动。”简单的语句中充满着丰富的真理，对每一个从事社会主义建设的人都会有很大的启发。
    建议人民日报今后多登兄弟国家的通讯，并继续扩大报道面。
