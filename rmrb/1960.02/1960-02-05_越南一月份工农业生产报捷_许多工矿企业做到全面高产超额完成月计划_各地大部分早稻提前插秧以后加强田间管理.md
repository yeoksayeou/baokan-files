Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 2nd: Since January, industrial and agricultural production in North Vietnam has progressed rapidly, and the masses are highly motivated. Many industrial and mining enterprises have overfulfilled their January production plans; the early rice has been basically planted in rural areas throughout the country.

The Hai Phong Cement Plant, one of Vietnam's important enterprises, overfulfilled its January plan in all its branches by January 31. This is the most comprehensive and highest-yielding month in the cement plant's production in recent years. The plant's workers actively sought ways to overcome various difficulties and increase production. The mixing branch mixed 2,595 cubic meters of cement more than the original target, and the clinker burning branch overfulfilled the plan by 3,510 tons.

The Hanoi Red River Stationery Factory, built with Chinese assistance, also achieved good results in January. The fountain pen branch and the pencil branch, which account for three-quarters of the factory's total output value, both overfulfilled their January plans. The factory's employees' insistence on labor competitions and continuous improvement of labor efficiency is the basic reason for the factory's completion of the January plan.

Hai Phong Port, the Hai Phong Ha Long Bay Canned Fish Factory fishing team, and many other enterprises and units have also completed or overfulfilled their January production plans.

On the agricultural front, early rice has been planted in most areas. A large part of the planting plan for coarse grains and cash crops has also been completed. Many provinces planted seedlings ten to fifteen days earlier than in previous years. Most agricultural cooperatives, after consolidation, took the lead in planting in a timely manner or ahead of schedule, and the quality of planting was also better than in previous years.

Farmers in various places pay more attention to appropriate close planting and fertilization. At present, seedlings are generally growing well in various places. Many provinces have launched field management campaigns after the completion of planting. Thai Binh Province has applied an average of five to six dan of fertilizer per fen of land.

    越南重要企业之一海防水泥厂，到1月31日为止各个分厂都超额完成了1月份计划。这是水泥厂几年来生产上最全面、最高产的一个月份。这个厂的工人积极想办法、找窍门，克服各种困难，增加产量。拌搅分厂拌搅的水泥超过原订指标二千五百九十五立方米，烧泥分厂超额三千五百一十吨完成计划。
    由中国援助兴建的河内红河文具厂，1月份也取得了良好的成绩。占这个厂总产值四分之三的自来水笔分厂和铅笔分厂，都超额完成了1月份计划。全厂职工坚持劳动竞赛、不断提高劳动效率，是这个厂完成1月份计划的基本原因。

    各地农民更加重视适当密植和施肥。目前各地秧苗一般生长良好。许多省在插秧完毕后，展开了田间管理运动。太平省平均每分地已施肥五—六担。
