Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 8th -- The House Appropriations Committee today released the testimony of Army Secretary Brucker and Army Chief of Staff Lemnitzer at recent hearings before the committee. Brucker's testimony revealed that the United States has drawn up detailed plans for waging war in Southeast Asia.

    Brucker spoke of the U.S. war plans under the guise of denouncing the Chinese "threat" to Southeast Asian countries. He said, "The Joint Chiefs of Staff have war plans to deal with situations that arise in fulfilling or supporting our obligations to members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization there," particularly in Thailand and South Vietnam. But he revealed that war plans had even been drawn up for Laos, a country that is not a member of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Brucker said, "Although we do not have the same direct obligations there (Laos), the Joint Chiefs of Staff did consider this issue when the Lao issue arose, and have a plan for it."

    Lemnitzer added that the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff had formulated a general plan for waging war in Southeast Asia, and that the U.S. Pacific Commander-in-Chief had prepared specific plans for such operations.

    In discussing the Korean issue, Lemnitzer actually admitted that the United States has been constantly undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement and transporting new weapons into South Korea. He said without reservation, "After four years of effort, we have succeeded in stopping the provisions of Section 13 of the Armistice Agreement (this section explicitly prohibits the introduction of reinforcing combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons and ammunition from outside Korea - editor's note)", "We now have new equipment there."

    This newspaper reports, according to Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Bangkok news, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization aggressive bloc from January 28th began joint military exercises in the Gulf of Siam. According to this group's announcement, participating in this amphibious reconnaissance exercise named "Cooperation Two" are Marine Corps, engineering troops, reconnaissance teams, underwater demolition teams, etc. from the United States, Britain, Thailand, and Australia, and the United States has also dispatched submarines and high-speed troop transport ships to participate in this exercise.

    五角大楼头子透露
    美国已拟订东南亚作战计划
    新华社8日读　华盛顿消息：美国众议院拨款委员会今天公布了陆军部长布鲁克和陆军参谋长兰尼兹尔最近在这个委员会的意见听取会上的证词。布鲁克的证词透露，美国已经详细拟订了在东南亚进行战争的计划。
    布鲁克是在诬蔑中国“威胁”东南亚国家的幌子下谈到美国的战争计划的。他说，“参谋长联席会议有着战争计划来应付在履行或者支持我们对那里的东南亚条约组织成员国所承担的义务这个方面所发生的情况”，特别在泰国和南越。但是他透露，甚至对老挝这样一个并非东南亚条约组织成员国的国家，美国也拟订了战争计划。布鲁克说，“虽然我们在那里（老挝）没有同样的直接义务，参谋长联席会议却的确在老挝问题出现时考虑过这个问题，并且对此有一个计划”。
    兰尼兹尔补充说，美国参谋长联席会议制订了这种在东南亚进行战争的总计划，而美国的太平洋地区总司令准备了关于这种行动的具体计划。
    兰尼兹尔在谈到朝鲜问题时实际上承认了美国不断破坏朝鲜停战协定，把新式武器运进南朝鲜。他毫不掩饰地说，“经过四年的努力，我们成功地停止了停战协定第十三节的规定（这一节明确规定禁止自朝鲜境外进入增援的作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药——编者注）”，“我们现在在那里有着新式的装备”。
    本报讯　据新华社讯：曼谷消息，东南亚条约组织侵略集团从1月28日起在暹罗湾举行联合军事演习。据这个集团宣布，参加这次名为“第二次合作”的两栖侦察演习的，有美国、英国、泰国和澳大利亚的海军陆战队、工兵部队、侦察队、水底爆破队等，美国并且派出潜水艇和高速运兵舰参加这次演习。
