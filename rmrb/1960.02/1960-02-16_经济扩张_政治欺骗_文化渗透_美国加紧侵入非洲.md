    Economic Expansion  Political Deception  Cultural Infiltration
    The United States Intensifies its Aggression in Africa
    Xinhua News Agency, February 14th: According to recent reports in some foreign newspapers, American imperialism, while engaging in economic expansion and political deception in Africa, is using educational and technical "aid" to deceive and corrupt the hearts of Africans.
    An article in the British publication "Foreign Report" on January 7th, entitled "US Increases Aid to Africa," wrote that officials such as the Deputy Director of the US "International Cooperation Administration," Saccio, visited African countries such as Uganda, Tanganyika, Nigeria, and Ghana at the end of last year. They consulted with American diplomatic officials stationed in these countries. The article said that the head of the US "International Cooperation Administration" was appearing in West Africa for the first time. They quickly assessed local resources, needs, and desires. The article wrote that the US government is expected to request an increase in economic and technical "aid" to Africa, excluding the Mediterranean, to $30 million during the hearings held by various committees of Congress.
    The French newspaper "Le Monde" also wrote in a recent article that the US State Department intends to ask Congress this spring to increase loans for technical "aid" programs to countries south of the Sahara. The total amount of this aid has now reached approximately $15 million per year.
    An article written by an American, Adams, published in the Nigerian "West African Pilot" at the beginning of this year, revealed the situation of American aggression in Africa in the fields of culture and education. The article said that US private "aid" to African education has increased significantly in terms of amount and variety.
    US private "foundations" and "charitable organizations" have been promoting US-African "cooperation" for many years, especially in education and culture.
    The article also mentioned that in order to intensify the infiltration of American power into the African region, the US Senate has also established a permanent body to handle African affairs—the African Subcommittee. In a report on Africa published by this organization in October last year, it recommended that the United States adopt a "flexible, imaginative, and active" policy toward Africa. The US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Satterthwaite, once stated that the United States is trying to "encourage the sound and orderly development of the (African) continent in a manner consistent with the ideals of the free world."

    经济扩张  政治欺骗  文化渗透
    美国加紧侵入非洲
    据新华社14日讯　据最近一些外国报纸的消息透露，美帝国主义在向非洲进行经济扩张、政治欺骗的同时，正在利用教育和技术“援助”来骗取和腐蚀非洲人心。
    1月7日英国“外事报道”在一篇题为“美国增加对非洲的援助”的文章中写道，去年底，美国“国际合作署”副署长萨西奥等官员曾到乌干达、坦噶尼喀、尼日利亚和加纳等非洲国家进行活动。他们同驻在这些国家的美国外交官员进行了磋商。文章说，美国“国际合作署”的负责人还是第一次在西非出现。他们对当地的资源、需要和愿望迅速作出了估计。这篇文章写道，预料美国政府在国会各委员会举行的意见听取会中，将要求把不包括地中海在内的对非洲的经济和技术“援助”增加到三千万美元。
    法国“新闻报”也在最近一篇文章中写道，美国国务院打算今春要求国会增加对撒哈拉以南国家进行技术“援助”的计划的贷款。这项援助的总数现在已经达到每年一千五百万美元左右。
    尼日利亚“西非向导报”在今年初刊登的一篇美国人亚当斯写的文章中，透露了美国在文化和教育方面侵略非洲的情况。这篇文章说，美国对非洲教育的私人“援助”，在数额和种类方面都有显著的增加。
    美国私人“基金会”和“慈善组织”多年来都在提倡美非“合作”，特别是在教育和文化方面。
    文章还提到，为了加紧把美国势力渗入非洲地区，美国参议院还专门成立了一个处理非洲事务的常设机构——非洲小组委员会，这个组织在去年10月发表的一个关于非洲的报告中，建议美国采取“灵活、富有想像力和积极”的对非政策。美国负责非洲事务的助理国务卿萨脱斯威特曾经表示，美国试图“以一种符合自由世界理想的方式鼓励（非洲）大陆的健全而有秩序的发展”。
