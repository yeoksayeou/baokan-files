    Harbin Jin Xing Machinery Factory Organizes Internal and External Collaboration to Break Through Key Production Bottlenecks
    Foundry Workshop Fully Mechanized
    (According to Heilongjiang Daily) Harbin Jin Xing Machinery Factory, with the help of Harbin Institute of Technology, and based on the "overall mechanization of foundry production" draft designed by veteran worker Fu Xiangzhen, has, after more than twenty days of effort, fully mechanized and automated the foundry workshop.
    The mechanization and automation of the factory's foundry covers nine processes: automatic feeding, monorail conveying of molten iron, rotary table casting, loose mold molding, automatic shakeout, automatic sand screening, automatic sand mixing, automatic conveying of castings, and tumble barrel cleaning of castings, all of which have been mechanized and automated. Actual production appraisal shows that output has increased twelvefold, labor productivity has increased thirty-fivefold, and the number of production workers has decreased from forty to thirteen. As the operation process is mechanized and automated, product specifications have become consistent, and the casting qualification rate has increased from 40% to 95%. At the same time, the working conditions of workers have been greatly improved, the heavy manual labor of sand molders has been fundamentally eliminated, and occupational silicosis among foundry workers has been eliminated; the smoky and dusty conditions in the workshop have been completely changed, and workers can work in clean clothes without getting dirty.
    The Jin Xing Machinery Factory was established in October 1958 through the merger of ten production cooperatives and private factories engaged in ironware, sesame oil pressing, and other industries. After more than a year of technical innovation and technical revolution, the degree of mechanization of the entire factory has greatly improved, but the foundry workshop has been a weak link, with more than 90% of workers engaged in heavy manual labor. The low output, high cost, and poor quality of this workshop are key bottlenecks in the factory's production.
    When the Party branch decided to mobilize the masses to achieve production mechanization and automation in the foundry workshop, it was enthusiastically supported by the sand molders, but some people believed that sand molding could not be mechanized and automated, and that small factories did not have the conditions to do so. The Party branch mobilized the masses to debate repeatedly, organized visits and study, and improved the ideological understanding of all employees. The Party branch actively supported the suggestion of veteran worker Fu Xiangzhen and mobilized all factory employees to do something good for the mechanization and automation of the foundry workshop. In the process of vigorously promoting foundry mechanization, a method of overall mobilization, key breakthroughs, combining top-down efforts, and combining internal and external forces was adopted. Assistance was proactively sought from Harbin Institute of Technology, and a five-way combination group consisting of teachers, students, factory leaders, technicians, and veteran workers was formed to concentrate superior technical forces, review and revise Fu Xiangzhen's original draft, and solve three major technical bottlenecks such as turbine worm gear transmission.
    In the process of vigorously promoting foundry mechanization and automation, the factory promoted the spirit of self-reliance, adopted the method of using simple and crude means, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and mobilized workers to use scrap materials to manufacture eight pieces of indigenous equipment, which were assembled into a mechanized and automated foundry workshop.

    哈尔滨金星机械厂组织厂内外协作突破生产关键
    铸造车间全盘机械化
    据黑龙江日报消息　哈尔滨金星机械厂根据老工人傅祥祯设计的“铸造生产全盘机械化”的草图，取得哈尔滨工业大学的帮助，经过二十多天的努力，使铸造车间全盘实现了机械化与自动化。
    这个厂的铸造机械化与自动化，是从自动上料、单轨输送铁水、活动转盘浇铸、漏模造型、自动打箱、自动筛砂、自动混砂、自动传送铸件到滚筒清理铸件，九道工序全部实现了机械化、自动化。经过实际生产的鉴定，产量提高十二倍，劳动生产率提高三十五倍，生产工人由过去的四十人减少到十三人。由于操作过程实现机械化与自动化，产品规格达到了一致，铸件的合格率由过去的40％提高到95％。同时，大大改善了工人的劳动条件，从根本上消灭了翻砂工人的笨重的体力劳动，消除了铸工职业性矽肺病；车间里烟尘扑扑的状况已彻底改变，穿着干净的衣服劳动都不会被染污。
    金星机械厂是在1958年10月由铁业、磨香油等十个生产合作社和民办工厂合并成立的。经过一年多的技术革新和技术革命，全厂机械化程度有了很大提高，但是铸造车间却是一个薄弱环节，90％以上的工人从事笨重的体力劳动。这个车间产量低、成本高、质量差，是全厂的生产关键。
    党支部决定发动群众在铸造车间实现生产机械化与自动化时，得到翻砂工人的热烈响应，但是也有一部分人认为翻砂不能机械化与自动化，小厂没有条件搞等。党支部发动群众反复辩论，组织参观学习，提高了全体职工的思想认识。党支部积极支持了老工人傅祥祯的建议，发动全厂职工人人为铸造车间实现机械化与自动化做一件好事。在大搞铸造机械化的过程中，采取了全面发动、重点突击、上下结合、内外结合的方法，主动取得了哈尔滨工业大学的帮助，组成了教师。学生、工厂领导、技术人员和老工人等五结合小组，集中优势技术力量，审查和修改了傅祥祯原设计的草图，解决了涡轮涡杆传动等三大技术关键。
    在大搞铸造机械化与自动化的过程中，这个厂发扬了自力更生的精神，采取因陋就简、土洋结合的方法，发动工人自己动手利用边材余料制造了八部土设备，装成了一个机械化与自动化的铸造车间。（附图片）
