    Well-Arranged Life, Sufficient Production Enthusiasm
    You County Party Committee Comprehensively and Thoughtfully Arranges the Life of Commune Members, Mass Production Enthusiasm is Rising
    (Our newspaper Changsha, 20th) The You County of Hunan Province has comprehensively and properly arranged the lives of commune members during the spring plowing period, further mobilized the production enthusiasm of the vast commune members, and powerfully promoted the progress of the spring plowing production campaign.
    The You County Party Committee regards arranging the lives of the masses as an important part of leading spring plowing production. Since December of last year, the County Party Committee has held special meetings and issued multiple instructions regarding arranging the lives of commune members. The County Party Committee designated a secretary to manage the life arrangements during the spring plowing period, and the First Secretary of the County Party Committee personally went deep into Jiangqiao, Huangtuling, Yatangpu and other communes to inspect and arrange the lives of the masses during the spring plowing production and life inspection. Up to now, the county has properly arranged the food rations of commune members, prepared the necessary vegetables, firewood, oil, salt and other living materials for the spring plowing period, and made specific arrangements for the rain gear necessary for commune members to go to work and the spring disease prevention medicines.
    Planned grain consumption has become a common practice throughout the county. Since January of this year, more than 80% of the canteens have saved grain, with savings amounting to more than 390,000 jin. In terms of vegetable production, the County Party Committee, in conjunction with the development of the land reclamation campaign in December last year, mobilized the masses to expand the planting of vegetables by more than 70,000 mu. The county now has more than 100,000 mu of vegetable land, averaging more than two fen and four li per rural resident. In order to make vegetables diverse, high-yielding, and abundant, the county has launched a six-check (checking vegetable growth, missing seedlings, base fertilizer, management, reserves, and ideology) vegetable crash cultivation campaign. Through several expansion and cultivation campaigns, the county, in addition to ensuring that each person eats two to three jin of vegetables every day, has also reserved more than 20 million jin of dried vegetables, averaging more than 50 jin per person, and more than 200 canteens have reserved more than 100 jin of dried vegetables per person. After the county's water conservancy and soil improvement campaign basically ended last winter, the County Party Committee foresaw that labor would be tight during this year's spring plowing, and coupled with the fact that there are many rainy days and few sunny days in spring, the fuel problem would be a big problem, so it instructed all localities to store enough fuel for the spring plowing period. The county launched three mass campaigns to cut firewood and transport coal in two months, with 40,000 to 50,000 people participating in each campaign. Now, the canteens in the county generally have two months of fuel reserves, and more than 1,000 canteens have stored more than half a year's worth of fuel.
    The You County Party Committee has also taken effective measures to prevent some common infectious diseases in previous springs. The county has organized more than 5,600 medical personnel, combined with spring plowing and fertilizer accumulation, to mobilize the masses to carry out a spring hygiene campaign, conduct epidemic prevention propaganda to commune members, guide canteen cooks to do a good job in canteen hygiene, and organized more than 3,200 old farmers to dig medicinal materials and universally take medicine to prevent diseases. According to investigations, the county has more than 100,000 laborers, but lacks more than 200,000 pieces of rain gear. Under the leadership of the County Party Committee, the county has established 190 rain gear factories, concentrated 3,400 workers, and rushed to produce more than 120,000 pieces of rain gear.
    The You County Party Committee's approach of highly concerning itself with the lives of the masses and arranging spring plowing life early has greatly increased the production enthusiasm of the vast commune members and promoted the current production campaign.

    生活安排好　生产干劲足
    攸县县委安排社员生活全面周到，群众生产情绪越来越高涨
    本报长沙20日电　湖南省攸县全面妥善地安排好了春耕期间社员生活，进一步发动了广大社员生产积极性，有力地推动了春耕生产运动的进展。
    中共攸县县委把安排好群众生活作为领导春耕生产的一项重要内容。从去年12月以来，县委召开了专门会议和多次发出有关安排社员生活的指示。县委确定一个书记管理春耕期间的生活安排，县委第一书记在春耕生产、生活大检查中，亲自深入到江桥、皇图岭、鸭塘铺等公社，检查和安排群众生活。到目前止，全县已妥善安排了社员口粮，准备好了春耕期间所需蔬菜、柴火、油、盐等生活物资，对社员出工所必需的雨具及春季防病药品也都作了具体安排。
    计划用粮在全县已蔚然成风，今年元月以来有80％以上食堂节约了粮食，节约数达三十九万多斤。在蔬菜生产方面，县委在去年12月结合开展垦土运动，发动群众扩种蔬菜七万多亩，全县现有菜地十万多亩，按农村人口平均，每人有二分四厘多。为了使蔬菜多种、高产、多收，全县又开展了一个六查（查蔬菜生长、缺蔸、底肥、管理、储备、思想）的蔬菜突击培育运动。通过几次扩种和培育运动，全县除保证每人每天吃到两斤至三斤菜外，还储备了干菜两千多万斤，每个人平均达五十多斤，并有两百多个食堂每人已储备干菜达百斤以上。在去冬全县水利、改良土壤运动基本结束之后，县委就预见到今年春耕劳力紧张，加之春季雨天多晴天少，燃料问题是个很大的问题，当时就指示各地，储足春耕期间的燃料。全县在两个月内，共开展三次群众性的砍柴、运煤突击运动，每次投入运动的达四、五万人。现在，全县的食堂一般都储备了两个月的燃料，有一千多个食堂还储足了半年以上的燃料。
    攸县县委还根据历年春天常见的一些流行性疾病，已采取有效措施进行预防。全县共组织了五千六百多个医务人员，结合春耕积肥，发动群众大搞春季卫生运动，向社员进行防疫宣传，辅导食堂炊事员作好食堂卫生；并组织了三千二百多个老农挖药材，普遍服药防病。据调查，全县十多万劳动力，共缺少二十多万件雨具。在县委领导下，全县共兴办了一百九十个雨具工厂，集中了三千四百个工人，已赶制雨具十二万多件。
    攸县县委这种高度关心群众生活，及早安排好春耕生活的作法，大大提高了广大社员生产热情，推动了当前生产运动。
