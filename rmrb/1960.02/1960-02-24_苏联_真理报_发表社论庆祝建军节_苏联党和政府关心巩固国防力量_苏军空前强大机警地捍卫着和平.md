Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 23rd: The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" published an editorial today celebrating the 42nd anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army.

    The editorial said that the Soviet people are celebrating Soviet Army Day under the following circumstances: the Soviet Union has fully launched communist construction, the people's labor and political enthusiasm are unprecedentedly high, and the Soviet state is making unremitting efforts to further ease international tensions and consolidate universal peace. The editorial then said that while striving for peace, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government are tirelessly concerned about the consolidation of national defense strength. The achievements of the Soviet people in developing socialist economy, science, and technology have made it possible to equip the Soviet Army and Navy with the latest weapons, including powerful nuclear weapons and rocket weapons. The Soviet army is now unprecedentedly powerful and a reliable guarantee for the peace and security of all countries.

    The editorial said that the decree on further reducing the Soviet armed forces adopted by the Fourth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union vividly demonstrates the Soviet Union's growing power and the brilliant achievements of the Soviet people in realizing the historic resolutions of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This peace-loving action taken by the Soviet Union on the road to disarmament has further strengthened the international prestige and credibility of the Soviet Union as a banner of peace, and has further helped to expose the maintainers of the imperialist aggressive policy – the instigators of new wars.

    The editorial continued that today, the glorious Soviet armed forces have entered a new stage of development. After reducing its size and undergoing organizational restructuring, the Soviet Army and Navy will be further strengthened and improved in order to reliably ensure the security of the motherland as in the past. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government regularly and directly study various military construction issues. The leadership of the Communist Party is the main and decisive source of the strength and invincibility of the Soviet Army and Navy.

    The editorial concluded by pointing out that the Soviet armed forces will continue to improve their combat skills, maintain a high degree of vigilance, and undertake the lofty and glorious responsibility of faithfully and bravely defending the socialist motherland. The editorial said that the Soviet people believe that the Soviet army will vigilantly defend world peace!

    苏联“真理报”发表社论庆祝建军节
    苏联党和政府关心巩固国防力量
    苏军空前强大机警地捍卫着和平
    新华社莫斯科23日电　苏联“真理报”今天发表社论，庆祝苏联军队建军四十二周年。
    社论说，苏联人民是在这样的形势下庆祝苏军建军节的：苏联已经全面开展共产主义建设，人民的劳动和政治热情空前高涨，苏维埃国家为进一步缓和国际紧张局势和巩固普遍和平进行着不懈的斗争。社论接着说，苏联共产党和苏联政府在为争取和平而斗争的同时，正在不倦地关心国防力量的巩固。苏联人民在发展社会主义经济、科学和技术方面所取得的成就，使得有可能用最新式的武器，其中包括威力强大的核武器和火箭武器，来装备苏联陆军和海军。苏联军队如今已经空前强大有力，它是各国人民和平和安全的可靠的保障。
    社论说，苏联最高苏维埃第四次会议所通过的再次裁减苏联武装部队的法令，极其鲜明地证明了苏联日益增长的威力，证明了苏联人民在实现苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的历史性决议方面所取得的辉煌成就。苏联在裁军的道路上所作出的这一爱好和平的行动，更加加强了作为和平旗手的苏联的国际威望和信誉，更加有助于揭露帝国主义侵略政策的维护者——新战争的煽动者。
    社论接着说，今天，光荣的苏联武装部队已经进入了它的新的发展阶段。苏联陆军和海军在裁减人数并在组织上进行改编后，将更加加强和臻于完善，以便像过去一样可靠地保障祖国的安全。苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联政府经常地、直接地研究各种军事建设问题。共产党的领导，是苏联陆军和海军的力量和不可战胜的主要的、决定性的源泉。
    社论最后指出，苏联武装部队将不断提高自己的作战技能，将保持高度的警惕性，承担起忠实勇敢地保卫社会主义祖国的崇高而光荣的职责。社论说，苏联人民相信：苏联军队一定会机警地捍卫世界和平！
