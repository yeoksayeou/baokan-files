Xinhua News Agency, February 8th: After achieving a great victory in January's production level surpassing last December, the leap forward situation on the capital's industrial front is getting better and better. Since the Spring Festival, many factories have had high attendance rates, labor competitions are in full swing, technological innovations are blooming everywhere, and all indicators have been achieved in a full and satisfactory manner.

The good attendance rate in many units after the holiday is unprecedented in the ten years since liberation. According to statistics from one hundred factories and enterprises in Xuanwu District and Chaoyang District, the attendance rate was above 99% during the three days around the Spring Festival, with more than forty factories having full attendance every day.

From the first day of production after the holiday, many factories achieved full red in various indicators every day. The Beijing Crane Factory's production rose day by day from February 1st to 5th. During these five days, they also produced three double-girder bridge cranes and one single-girder bridge crane, all with qualified quality. The Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory exceeded its daily production plan for the first five days of the month by an average of 5%, and assembled three high-quality grain combine harvesters on the first day. The Beijing Electronic Tube Factory exceeded its production value, output, variety, and other major indicators every day; by the 5th, the average daily output value had increased by 11.69% compared with the same period in January, and the output of electronic tubes had increased by 5.8%.

The socialist labor competition in various factories after the Spring Festival is more widespread and in-depth than in January. Spring welcome competitions, opponent competitions, performance competitions, and daily red champion competitions are intertwined, greatly encouraging the workers' enthusiasm for labor. 100% of the workers in the North China Wireless Equipment United Factory participated in the competition, and more than 90% of the workers broke their quotas every day. The Zhang Qin milling group of the Xuanwu Motor Factory and the Li Zhenyuan group of the Civil Electrical Appliance Factory hooked up before the Spring Festival and set competition conditions. On the first day after the holiday, the Li Zhenyuan group completed the equivalent of more than one hundred days of work last year, and the Zhang Qin group completed the equivalent of more than fifty days of work last year.

The technological innovation and technological revolution movement, with the goal of achieving mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, has progressed very rapidly since the Spring Festival. The Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Factory and the Guanghua Wood Factory worked hard and skillfully in the five days after entering February, and built thirteen automatic and semi-automatic production lines. Workers in the assembly workshop of the Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Factory used electric tools to assemble car tires, which could assemble one unit in thirty seconds, increasing efficiency by a hundred times compared to before. The Beijing Electronic Tube Factory achieved more than 3,000 technological innovations in five days.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 8th: The situation of industrial production in Tianjin after the Spring Festival shows that the spring of 1960 is an extraordinary spring. In the first five days of February, many factories achieved daily red and all-round red. According to statistics from Nankai and Hongqiao districts: 168 factories completed their plans comprehensively every day. Factories in Nankai District exceeded the production plan for the first five days by an average of 10%, and the daily production level increased by an average of 4.33% compared with January. The balance of production has been significantly improved, from large enterprises with ten thousand people to small enterprises with dozens of people. In Hedong District, where large enterprises are relatively concentrated, approximately 80% of factories continuously exceeded their plans. The electromechanical industry assembled products such as gear shaping machines and tractors in the first five days.

In the past two or three months, Tianjin's workers have carried out a technological innovation movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization. By the eve of the Spring Festival, the proportion of mechanized and semi-mechanized production in various factories had increased from 43% to 52%. On the first day of work after the holiday, many factory workers went to the factory carrying new innovation suggestions. More than 500 employees of the Hui Fu Pharmaceutical Factory brought a total of 720 technological innovation proposals on the first day of work after the holiday, and realized 690 of them in the first five days of February. During the Spring Festival, more than 300 workers in the casting workshops of eleven factories in Nankai District jointly formed 33 commando teams to accelerate the technical transformation of the casting work, and realized 33 mechanization measures. On the first day of work after the holiday, the charging, rolling, and screening processes in the casting workshops were all mechanized.

The competition launched by hundreds of thousands of workers in the city takes various forms, including technical performance competitions, selection competitions for innovation experts, spring welcoming long-distance running competitions, and assembly line relay races between upstream and downstream processes. Everyone is chasing after each other, helping each other, and leaping forward together. On the first day of work after the Spring Festival, the Spring and Harmony Weaving Factory encountered difficulties in the sizing process. After learning about this, the sizing workers of Tianjin Sixth Cotton Textile Factory went to work one day early and rushed to size 48 shafts of yarn, supporting the Spring and Harmony Weaving Factory in achieving the New Year's Red. Guo Shufang, a lathe operator at the Agricultural Machinery Factory, often lagged behind her competitor, Ning Yumei, in production. She studied day and night during the Spring Festival and improved a set of tools. On the first day of work after the holiday, she exceeded her production task by 81% and caught up with Ning Yumei. After work, Guo Shufang gave this set of tools to Ning Yumei, enabling Ning Yumei to exceed the plan by two and a half times and surpass herself again.

    广大职工奋战不平凡的春天创造不平凡的成绩
    京津工业新跃进百花竞放
    许多工厂春节后实现各项生产指标日日红满堂红
    据新华社8日讯　在取得1月生产水平超过去年12月的大捷之后，首都工业战线上的跃进形势越来越好。春节过后至今，很多工厂出勤率高，劳动竞赛热火朝天，技术革新遍地开花，实现了各项指标满堂红。
    很多单位节后出勤情况之好，为解放十年所未有。据宣武区、朝阳区一百个工厂企业的统计，春节前后三天出勤率都在99％以上，其中有四十多个工厂天天全勤。
    从节后生产第一天起，很多工厂各项指标天天实现满堂红。北京起重机器厂2月1日至5日生产日日高升，在这五天之内，他们还生产了三台双梁桥式起重机，一台单梁桥式起重机，质量全部合格。北京农业机械厂平均每天超额5％完成本月份前五天日产计划，第一天就总装出三台质量良好的谷物联合收割机。北京电子管厂产值、产量、品种等各项主要指标，天天都超额完成；到5日为止，平均日产值较1月份同期增长11．69％，电子管产量增长了5．8％。
    春节后各工厂社会主义劳动竞赛比1月份开展得更加广泛深入。迎春赛、对手赛、表演赛和日日红冠军赛等各种竞赛形式交织在一起，大大鼓舞了职工们的劳动热情。华北无线电器材联合厂100％的工人参加了竞赛，每天有90％以上的工人突破定额。宣武电机厂张勤铣刨小组同民用电器厂李振元小组在春节前挂好钩，订了竞赛条件，节后第一天，李振元小组完成了相当去年一百多天的工作量，张勤小组完成了相当去年五十多天的工作量。
    以实现机械化半机械化、自动化半自动化为目标的技术革新和技术革命运动，春节以来进展得非常迅速。北京汽车制造厂、光华木材厂在进入2月后的五天内，苦干加巧工，建成了十三条自动和半自动生产流水线。北京汽车制造厂装配车间的工人采用电工具装配汽车轮胎，三十秒钟就能装配一台，效率较前提高一百倍。北京电子管厂五天内实现了三千多项技术革新。
    据新华社天津8日电　春节后天津市工业生产的形势，显示出1960年的春天是一个不平凡的春天。2月头五天，许多工厂做到了日日红、全面红。据南开、红桥两个区统计：天天全面完成计划的工厂有一百六十八个。南开区各厂平均超额10％完成头五天的生产计划，日产水平比1月份平均提高4．33％。生产的均衡性，从万人的大型企业到几十人的小型企业，都有显著提高。大型企业比较集中的河东区，连续超额完成计划的工厂约占80％。机电工业在头五天中装配出了插齿机、拖拉机等产品。
    天津市职工在最近两三个月来，开展以机械化半机械化为中心的技术革新运动，到春节前夕，各厂的机械化半机械化生产的比重由43％提高到52％。许多工厂的职工在节后开工第一天，就携带着新的革新建议走向工厂。惠符制药厂五百多名职工在节后开工第一天共带来技术革新建议七百二十件，在2月头五天里实现了六百九十件。南开区十一个工厂的铸工车间的三百多名职工，春节期间共同组成三十三个突击队，加速铸工工种的技术改造，实现了三十三项机械化措施，节后开工第一天，铸工车间的上料、轧铁、筛砂三道工序就全部实现了机械化。
    全市几十万职工开展的竞赛形式多种多样，有技术表演赛、革新能手选拔赛、迎春长跑赛、上下工序一条龙接力赛等，大家你追我赶，互助合作，共同跃进。春和织布厂节后开工第一天，浆纱工序遇到了困难；天津第六棉纺织厂浆纱工人知道后，就提前一天上班，突击了四十八轴浆纱，支援春和织布厂实现了新春红。农业机械厂的车工郭淑芳，生产常常落后于她的竞赛对手宁玉梅。她在春节期间日夜钻研，改进了一套刀具，节后开工第一天就超额了81％完成生产任务，赶上了宁玉梅。郭淑芳下班后，把这套刀具给了宁玉梅，使宁玉梅超额两倍半完成计划，又超过了自己。
