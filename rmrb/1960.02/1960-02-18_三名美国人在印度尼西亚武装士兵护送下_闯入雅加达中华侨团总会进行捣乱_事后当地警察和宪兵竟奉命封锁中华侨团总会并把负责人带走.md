Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 16th: This morning at 9:00 AM, three Americans who identified themselves as journalists, escorted by two Indonesian armed soldiers and accompanied by an Indonesian in plain clothes, intruded into the office of the Jakarta Chinese Association without permission, using taking photos and filming as a pretext to cause trouble.

The staff of the Chinese Association tried to dissuade them from their actions, but they remained arrogant and continued to cause trouble. One of the Indonesian armed soldiers escorting them threatened, "If you don't allow us to do this, I will take action." The Americans even used cameras, etc., to beat members of the Chinese Association who were trying to prevent them from taking pictures, which led to an argument between the two sides. At this time, an armed soldier fired six shots to threaten them. The three Americans refused to state which newspaper organization they belonged to. When asked why they brought armed soldiers here, they quickly slipped away. Shortly after this incident, Indonesian public security personnel came to the Chinese Association to investigate. At this time, Indonesian police and military police were ordered to seal off the Jakarta Chinese Association. They did not withdraw until 11:00 AM on the 16th, and they took away the person in charge of the Chinese Association.

It is worth noting that this provocative incident occurred when the Chinese Association was busy assisting in receiving Chinese nationals who had been concentrated in Jakarta from various parts of West Java, preparing to return to their home country, under the entrustment of the relevant military authorities in some areas of West Java.

According to members of the Chinese Association, this was the third time these Americans had come to this organization to engage in provocative photographic activities. It is reported that a Chiang gang secret agent also followed this group to the Chinese Association today. When the incident occurred, he hurriedly took photographs there.

    三名美国人在印度尼西亚武装士兵护送下
    闯入雅加达中华侨团总会进行捣乱
    事后当地警察和宪兵竟奉命封锁中华侨团总会并把负责人带走
    新华社雅加达16日电　今天上午九时，有三名自称为新闻记者的美国人，在两名印度尼西亚武装士兵的护送下和一名穿便服的印度尼西亚人陪同下，未经许可闯入雅加达中华侨团总会办公处所内，借照像和拍电影为名，进行捣乱。
    中华侨团总会的工作人员对他们的行为加以劝阻，但是他们仍然态度傲慢，继续捣乱。护送他们的一个印度尼西亚武装士兵扬言，“如果你不允许我们这样做，我就采取行动。”美国人竟用照像机等殴打阻止他们拍照的侨团总会的人员，因此双方发生了争吵。这时，一个武装士兵竟然开枪打了六响，进行威胁。这三名美国人拒绝说明他们属于那一家报纸单位。当他们被问到：他们为什么要带武装士兵到这里来的时候，他们就赶快溜走了。这件事情发生后不久，印度尼西亚公安人员到侨团总会来调查这件事。这时，印度尼西亚的警察和宪兵竟奉命封锁中华侨团总会。他们直到16日上午十一时才撤走，并且将中华侨团总会的负责人带走。
    值得注意的是，这种挑衅事件是在中华侨团总会受西爪哇一些地方的有关军事当局的委托，正忙于协助接待从西爪哇集中到雅加达准备归国的华侨的时候发生的。
    据中华侨团总会人员说，这些美国人到这个团体来进行挑衅性的摄影活动这是第三次了。据悉，一名蒋帮特务分子今天也曾跟着这批人到中华侨团总会来。在事情发生时，他就急忙在那里进行摄影活动。
