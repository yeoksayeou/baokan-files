    Success and Failure

    In the movement of vigorously promoting technological innovation, many successful creations have come from the path of failure.

    A technological innovation expert is often someone who is not afraid of difficulties. Faced with failure after failure, he does not retreat in the face of battle, but learns from the lessons and continues to fight. Therefore, the final result is often victory.

    The People's Daily published the innovative feat of Wang Linhe in trial-producing a high-voltage bridge, which is very vivid. One time, two times, three times... up to "three hundred and seventy" trials, it was still not successful. But on the three hundred and seventy-first time, it finally succeeded. This fact is very thought-provoking. The old saying "failure is the mother of success" is absolutely correct.

    The "three hundred and seventy-first" success is what we diligently seek. But this does not mean that the previous three hundred and seventy failures were just a blind man lighting a lamp—a waste of effort. Rather, we absorbed the valuable experience of the three hundred and seventy times, and finally achieved the three hundred and seventy-first success, creating the high-voltage bridge. With this spirit of not being discouraged after experiencing three hundred and seventy failures, we can overcome all difficulties and move towards the road to success.

    成功与失败
    在大搞技术革新的运动中，很多成功的创造是从失败的道路上走过来的。
    一个技术革新能手，往往是不畏艰险的人物。他面对着一次又一次的失败，不是临阵脱逃，而是吸取教训，继续战斗，因而最后结果往往总是胜利。
    人民日报刊登的王林鹤试制高压电桥的革新创举，十分生动。一次、两次、三次……一直到“三百七十”次的试制，还未成功。但到了第三百七十一次上，终于成功了。这个事实很发人深省，古语说的“失败是成功之母”，一点也不错。
    “三百七十一”次的成功，是我们孜孜以求的。但这并不意味着以前的三百七十次失败，只是瞎子点灯——白费，而是吸取了三百七十次的宝贵经验，终于取得了第三百七十一次的成功，制成了高压电桥。有了这种历经三百七十次失败而不气馁的精神，就能踢倒一切困难，走向成功的道路。
