    Advancing Towards Weak Links
    Jing Yu
    Recently, the spearhead of technological innovation and technological revolution has been increasingly focused on weak links.
    What are weak links? Generally speaking, weak links are places where the pace of progress lags behind. The existence and transformation of weak links have a great impact on the entire chain. After more than a year of technological innovation and technological revolution, the degree of mechanization of the Harbin Jinxing Machinery Factory has greatly improved; only the foundry workshop has failed to keep up. More than 90% of the workers are engaged in manual labor, which not only results in low output, high costs, and poor quality. This affects the overall leap forward of the entire factory. Later, because the leadership was determined to concentrate its efforts to break through this weak link, as a result, after more than twenty days of effort, all nine processes were mechanized and automated. Output quickly increased twelvefold, labor productivity increased thirty-fivefold, and the qualified rate of castings increased from 40% to 95%. And the number of production workers was reduced from forty to thirteen. From then on, the manual operation originally used in the foundry workshop became mechanized and automated operation, and along with the metal processing workshop, it leaped forward. The weak link became a strong link. The speed of the change and the magnitude of the impact demonstrate the far-reaching significance of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement targeting weak links.
    After a weak link is broken through, where does the spearhead of technological innovation and technological revolution point? It still points to weak links. The movement and development of things are unbalanced. When one aspect advances, another aspect appears to be backward, and thus weak links emerge. Especially in an era of leaping development where one day equals twenty years, weak links will appear one after another. Old weak links are overcome, and new weak links arise. In this way, by constantly overcoming the old and constantly seizing the new, our cause can continuously leap forward.
    Since weak links will appear one after another, how should leaders correctly deal with this issue and correctly handle this issue? In summary, pay attention to the following three points: first, recognize it clearly; second, grasp it firmly; and third, transform it quickly. To recognize it clearly means to truly grasp the location of the weak link. Weak links are often an obstacle to the progress of work. If the weak link is not seen, then it is often impossible to change the work situation. To grasp it firmly means to concentrate the use of strength, aimed at the weak link, and not to use strength evenly, without distinguishing between importance and triviality, grabbing everything at once. In war, concentrate superior forces to break through weak fortresses; the same should be true in production and construction. To transform it quickly means not to stay in the original battle position, satisfied with the existing achievements. Instead, promptly pay attention to the new situation and quickly transfer forces to new problems.
    The above three points are only from the perspective of leadership methods. To effectively mobilize the masses to advance towards weak links wave after wave, it is inseparable from the principle of putting politics in command.
    In an era of continuous leap forward, constantly paying attention to the weak links in work is an important task for leaders of all departments. At present, it is not only the foundry workshop of the mechanical industry that is a weak link. Loading, unloading, and transportation in transportation, mining and crushing in mining, excavation of earth and stone in basic construction, as well as various industries with a large proportion of manual operations, are all weak links that cannot keep up with the needs of the leap forward situation. The times demand that these links catch up quickly, and they are catching up.

    向薄弱环节进军
    静宇
    近来，技术革新和技术革命的矛头愈来愈集中地指向薄弱环节。
    什么是薄弱环节？一般地说，薄弱环节就是某些跃进步伐赶不上去的地方。薄弱环节的存在和转变，对于整个链索有着很大的影响。哈尔滨金星机械厂经过一年多的技术革新和技术革命，全厂机械化程度有了很大的提高；只有铸造车间赶不上去。90％以上的工人从事手工劳动，不仅产量低，成本高，质量也很差。这就影响了整个工厂的全面跃进。后来，由于领导方面下定决心集中力量突破这个薄弱环节，结果，经过二十多天的努力，九道工序全部实现了机械化和自动化，产量很快就提高了十二倍，劳动生产率提高了三十五倍，铸件合格率由过去的40％提高到95％。而生产工人则由过去的四十人减少到十三人。从此，铸造车间原来沿用的手工操作，变成了机械化自动操作，同金属加工车间一起，飞跃前进，薄弱环节变成了坚强环节。变化之快，影响之大，技术革新和技术革命运动的矛头指向薄弱环节之深远意义于此可见。
    一个薄弱环节被突破以后，技术革新和技术革命的矛头还指向哪里呢？仍是指向薄弱环节。事物的运动发展是不平衡的。某一方面先进了，另一方面就显得落后了，从而也就出现了薄弱环节。特别处在一天等于二十年的飞跃发展的时代，薄弱环节是会一个接连一个地出现的。旧的薄弱环节克服了，新的薄弱环节又产生了。这样，不断克服旧的，又不断抓住新的，我们的事业就能不断的跃进。
    薄弱环节既然会一个接连一个地出现，那末，领导人员怎样正确地对待这个问题，并且正确地处理这个问题呢？概括说来，要注意以下三点：第一、要认得清，第二、要抓得狠，第三、要转得快。所谓认得清，就是要真正把握薄弱环节的所在。薄弱环节常常是影响工作前进的一种障碍。如果看不到薄弱环节，那就往往不可能改变工作局面。所谓抓得狠，就是要集中使用力量，对准薄弱环节，绝不是平均使用力量，不分轻重主次，眉毛胡子一把抓。战争上集中优势兵力，突破薄弱堡垒；生产建设上也应该如此。所谓转得快，就是不停留在原有的战斗位置，满足于已有的成果。而是及时注意到新的情况，很快把力量转到新的问题上去。
    以上三点仅仅是从领导方法来说的，要有效地动员群众后浪推前浪地向薄弱环节进军，还离不开政治挂帅的原则。
    在持续跃进的时代，经常注意到工作中的薄弱环节，是一切部门领导人员的一项重要任务。当前，岂止机械工业的铸工车间属于薄弱环节。交通运输上的装卸运送，矿山开采中的采掘和粉碎，基本建设中的开挖土石方，以及其他手工操作比重较大的各行各业，都是赶不上跃进形势需要的薄弱环节。时代要求这些环节迅速赶上去，它们也正在赶上去。
