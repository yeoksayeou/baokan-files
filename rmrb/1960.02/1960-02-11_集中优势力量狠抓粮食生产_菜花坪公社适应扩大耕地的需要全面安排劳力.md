Concentrate Superior Forces to Vigorously Grasp Grain Production
Caihuaping Commune Comprehensively Arranges Labor to Adapt to the Needs of Expanded Cultivated Land

(Our newspaper Changsha, 10th dispatch) The Caihuaping Commune in You County, Hunan Province, in accordance with the spirit of taking grain as the key link and overall leap forward, has rationally arranged its labor force, and the spring plowing production campaign has been launched in full swing.

Because the Caihuaping Commune conscientiously implements the policy of combining multiple planting with multiple harvests and high yield with multiple harvests, the cultivated land area has increased by 25,000 mu this year. Among them, the grain cultivated land has increased by 13,000 mu; the planting area of double-season rice will also be expanded from 34,000 mu last year to 51,000 mu; the sowing area of spring harvest crops has doubled compared with last year, reaching 60,000 mu. Pig raising will be developed from 28,000 heads last year to 100,000 heads. The planting area of cash crops will also increase slightly compared with last year. As a result, the task of spring plowing production is greater than in any previous year, and the quality requirements are also greatly improved, so the labor force is particularly strained. According to calculations, there is a 30% labor deficit from January 15 to Qingming Festival (April 5). In view of this situation, the commune party committee, as early as mid-January, when the winter water conservancy construction, transportation infrastructure, and land reclamation afforestation tasks were nearing completion, and the intense spring plowing production campaign was about to begin, made a reasonable arrangement of the labor force. In arranging the labor force, the commune party committee emphasized strengthening the main attack line of agriculture and first satisfying the labor force required for grain and pig production; at the same time, it also appropriately took into account other aspects. However, some cadres had a kind of thinking that they attached importance to cash crops and underestimated grain crops, and when arranging the labor force, they emphasized drawing more labor and drawing good labor to manage cash crops. The major brigades arranged 4,400 strong laborers in this area, accounting for 25% of the total labor force of the commune (in fact, about 2,000 laborers are enough). The livestock farms, aquaculture farms, and flower and fruit mountains run by the commune and brigades also mostly drew strong young laborers from the production teams. Many of these things could have been undertaken by semi-laborers. In view of these situations, the commune party committee repeatedly conducted education on taking grain as the key link and overall leap forward among the cadres, and based on this spirit, made reasonable arrangements for the labor force for spring plowing production.

In order to strengthen the main attack line of agriculture, the You County Party Committee, in arranging the labor force, first ensured the needs of grain and pig production in terms of quantity and quality. According to the need to expand the cultivated area of grain, expand double-season rice, and increase the yield per unit area, of the 20,400 laborers in the commune, 14,000 people (accounting for 70% of the total labor force) were drawn during the spring plowing period, and most of them were young and strong, to engage in grain production; 1,200 people raised pigs; 2,000 people engaged in cash crops; and other aspects such as livelihood and welfare, commune-run industry, sideline occupations, animal husbandry, and aquaculture were also appropriately arranged according to needs. In order to realize this labor allocation plan, they adopted six major measures: First, rush to complete the winter production finishing projects such as water conservancy, roads, and land reclamation afforestation. The commune organized 6,500 people to rush for three days and completed the remaining four reservoirs, 21 canals, and 12,000 mu of afforestation tasks. The labor force originally occupied by these aspects was completely transferred to spring production such as accumulating fertilizer and deep plowing. Second, compress a batch of labor from industries, livelihood and welfare, sideline occupations, and cash crops. Originally, there were 2,800 people in this commune responsible for livelihood and welfare work. Due to the promotion of rice milling machines and the change of transporting firewood and coal from carrying on shoulders to horse carts and wooden sailboats, and some canteens also implemented self-flowing water, a batch of labor could be saved. According to the spirit of doing less during the busy farming season and doing more during the slack farming season, some labor can also be compressed in sideline production. A total of more than 3,700 laborers were compressed from the above aspects and invested in agricultural production. Third, rationally allocate and re-adjust the labor force occupied by cash crops, commune-run industries, and animal husbandry production. They decided to organize cash crop professional teams, with reasonable combination of strong and weak, and change the past practice of only transferring strong laborers; they also used semi-laborers to exchange some strong laborers from industries and animal husbandry. The commune exchanged more than 1,400 people. Fourth, postpone some things that can be postponed temporarily. In this way, more than 2,000 people can be drawn to engage in spring plowing. Fifth, complete some farm work in advance, so as not to squeeze all the work into the month or so before Qingming Festival. They plan to complete the task of accumulating 800 dan of fertilizer per mu by the end of February, and transport it all to the fields; winter fallow fields will also be plowed three times by the end of February. Sixth, implement the method of combining large-scale corps cooperation with professional division of labor. Whether it is large-scale corps operations or professional team management, labor quotas have been formulated, and a responsibility system and reward and punishment system have been established with fixed tasks, fixed time, fixed quality, and fixed work points.

At present, the spring plowing production of this commune is progressing rapidly and vigorously. Each mu has accumulated 600 dan of fertilizer, and 42,000 mu of winter fallow fields have been completely plowed. Early rice seeds have been selected, and the preparatory work for production in other aspects is also progressing rapidly.

### 集中优势力量狠抓粮食生产  菜花坪公社适应扩大耕地的需要全面安排劳力

    集中优势力量狠抓粮食生产
    菜花坪公社适应扩大耕地的需要全面安排劳力
    本报长沙10日电　湖南省攸县菜花坪公社，根据以粮为纲、全面跃进的精神，合理安排劳动力，春耕生产运动已轰轰烈烈开展起来。
    菜花坪公社由于认真执行多种多收和高产多收相结合的方针，今年耕地面积扩大了二万五千亩。其中粮食耕地增加一万三千亩；双季稻的种植面积也将由去年的三万四千亩扩大到五万一千亩；春收作物的播种面积，比去年增加了一倍，达到六万亩。养猪更要由去年的二万八千头发展到十万头。经济作物播种面积也将比去年略有增加。这样一来，春耕生产任务比以往任何一年都大，而且质量也要求大大提高，因此劳动力格外显得紧张。据计算，从1月15日到清明（4月5日）这一段，有30％的劳动赤字。根据这个情况，公社党委早在1月中旬，当冬修水利、交通基建、开荒造林等任务快要完成，紧张的春耕生产运动即将开始的时候，便对劳动力进行了合理的安排。在安排劳动力当中，公社党委强调加强农业主攻战线，首先满足粮食和养猪生产所需要的劳动力；同时，也适当兼顾其他。但是，一些干部有一种重视经济作物、轻视粮食作物的思想，在安排劳动力时，强调要多抽劳动力和抽好劳动力经营经济作物，各大队在这方面安排了四千四百个强壮的劳动力，占全社总劳动力的25％（实际上有两千个左右劳动力就够了）。公社、大队办的畜牧场、水产养殖场、花果山等，也大都是从生产队抽调的青壮年劳动力。而这些事情有许多本来是半劳动力可以负担得了的。根据这些情况，公社党委在干部中反复进行了以粮为纲、全面跃进的教育，并本着这个精神对春耕生产的劳动力作了合理安排。
    为了加强农业战线的主攻战线，攸县县委在安排劳动力上，首先从数量上和质量上保证了粮食和养猪生产的需要。根据扩大粮食耕地面积、扩大双季稻和提高单位面积产量的需要，全社二万零四百个劳动力，在春耕这一段时间内，抽出一万四千人（占总劳动力70％），而且大部是青壮年，搞粮食生产；一千二百人养猪；二千人搞经济作物；其他生活福利、社办工业、副业、畜牧、水产等方面，也根据需要作了适当安排。为了实现这个劳力调配计划，他们采取六大措施：第一，突击完成水利、道路、开荒造林等冬季生产扫尾工程。全社组织六千五百人突击三天，完成了剩下的四处水库和二十一条渠道、一万二千亩造林任务。原来这些方面占用的劳动力，就全部转到积肥、深耕等春季生产。第二，从工业、生活福利、副业、经济作物等方面压缩一批劳动力。原来这个公社有二千八百人负担生活福利工作，由于推广了碾米机，运柴运煤由肩挑改为马车、木帆船，一些食堂又实行了用水自流化，就可以节约出一批劳动力来。根据农忙少干、农闲大干的精神，副业生产方面也可以压缩一些劳动力。以上几方面一共压缩出三千七百多个劳动力投入到农业生产。第三，合理搭配，重新调整经济作物、社办工业、畜牧生产等方面所占用的劳动力。他们决定组织经济作物专业队，强弱合理搭配，改变过去只调强劳动力的作法；还用半劳动力从工业、畜牧业等方面换出了一些强壮劳动力。全社共换出一千四百多人。第四，推迟一些暂时可以缓办的事情。这样，可以抽出二千多人搞春耕。第五，提前作完一些农活，以免各项工作都挤到清明前的个把月里。他们计划在2月底完成每亩积肥八百担的任务，并全部运到田里；冬闲田也在2月底做好三道犁耙。第六，实行大兵团大协作和专业分工相结合的办法。无论大兵团作战或专业队经营，都制订了劳动定额，建立了定任务、定时间、定质量、定工分的责任制和奖惩制度。
    目前，这个公社的春耕生产进度快、声势大，每亩已积肥六百来担，四万二千亩冬闲田已全部翻耕过来，早稻种已经选好，其他各方面的生产备耕工作进展也很快。
