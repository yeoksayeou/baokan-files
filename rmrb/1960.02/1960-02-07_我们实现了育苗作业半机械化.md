    We Have Achieved Semi-Mechanization of Nursery Operations
    Liaoning Province Beizhen County State-Owned Nursery

    In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, our nursery, under the correct leadership and care of the Party and higher authorities, has made some achievements in reforming nursery tools. We have created and improved a total of 21 tools, of which three are for land preparation and bed making, three are for sowing, six are for cultivation, three are for seedling lifting, and six are for other purposes such as cutting strips and pulling stakes. In addition, by adopting new-style animal-powered agricultural implements such as plows, harrows, rollers, shovels, and cultivators used in agriculture, we have basically completed a set of semi-mechanized nursery tools, achieving semi-mechanization of nursery operations.

    Due to the continuous reform of tools and the widespread use of new tools, significant changes have taken place in the production of our nursery. Labor productivity and operational quality have been greatly improved compared to the past, while labor intensity and production costs have been significantly reduced. Take sowing as an example. In the past, seeds were completely hand-sown, and when sowing certain tree species, workers had to manually carry sieves to sift sand and cover the soil. Now, using a ridge sowing machine, two people can sow one hectare in a day, increasing efficiency by eleven times. For field management, previously relying solely on small hand rakes and knives for weeding and soil loosening, we now have various cultivation and soil loosening tools, which not only increase efficiency by three to six times compared to the past but also facilitate timely management and control of weed growth. Seedling lifting is the most labor-intensive, arduous, and technically demanding task in the nursery. In the past, using large hoes to lift seedlings, although our palms were worn out and we were too tired to climb into bed at night, one person could not lift even one fen of land in a day. Now, with a seedling lifting plow, using animal power, four people and four horses can lift more than ten mu of seedlings in a day; using a tractor, three people can lift 27 mu in a day. At the same time, operational quality has significantly improved, with the seedling damage rate reduced from 5% to below 0.1%, reducing the loss of more than 50,000 seedlings per hectare. The effect of reducing seedling loss is particularly significant when lifting fruit tree seedlings.

    The most important reason for our nursery's achievements in tool reform is the correct leadership and close care of the Party. Over the years, every achievement we have made in tool reform has been rewarded by the county, province, and central government (four collective awards, and about half of the employees have received honorary or material rewards). This is a tremendous encouragement to us and a profound education. In addition, the Party and higher authorities have continuously provided us with specific guidance and support. In March last year, when labor was very tight, the County Party Secretary of Beizhen County personally approved the establishment of a tool repair and assembly team, equipped with four iron and woodworkers, and also solved the problem of a lack of scrap steel. When we were researching the seedling lifting plow, Liu Huanzhang, Deputy Director of the County Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, personally came to the site to encourage us not to be afraid of failure. All of this has inspired the creative enthusiasm of the staff and encouraged everyone to work harder.

    Starting from production, using indigenous methods, starting small, growing large, moving from simple to complex, and continuously improving is a simple and correct path for tool reform. Almost every tool we have created and improved started from small and indigenous beginnings, and was continuously improved and enhanced through experimentation and production. For example, our sowing machine initially was just a five-toothed harrow, but it increased efficiency by more than two times compared to the old tools. When we used it to open ditches in the sowing ground, we had the idea of automatic seeding. Later, referring to the seeding principle of agricultural sowing machines, we finally made a five-row strip sowing machine. Later, with changes in operational specifications, we transformed it into a ridge sowing machine. Last spring, referring to the winged-seed sowing machine created by the Heishan County Nursery, we comprehensively designed and transformed it into a relatively complete ridge sowing machine that can sow both medium-sized seeds and winged seeds.

    There are many difficulties in tool reform, the most important of which are a lack of scientific knowledge and a shortage of raw materials and equipment. However, we have continuously overcome these difficulties under the leadership of the Party. Lacking scientific knowledge, we learned more from practice and paid more attention to observing the structure of agricultural machinery, looking for reference materials to read with the spirit of learning whatever we needed. For example, when we were initially researching the seedling lifting plow, we found that the plowshare would not go into the soil and could not be held straight. We analyzed the problems that occurred in practice and looked for books to read. Finally, we found the problem of the plow not entering the soil in a small booklet on "foreign plows." To solve the problem of insufficient raw materials and equipment, we often collected waste materials. Old waterwheels, old farm implements, scrap iron, and old bicycle parts were all good materials for us to reform and manufacture tools.

    Although we have achieved the above achievements, we are still far from the actual requirements. In 1960, on the existing foundation, we will, based on the needs of continuous development of production, further research the mechanization of nursery tools in further developing nursery work. We will certainly continue to implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, hold the red flag of tool reform even higher, and push the technological innovation in forestry production from one peak to another.

    我们实现了育苗作业半机械化
    辽宁省北镇县国营苗圃
    几年来，特别是1958年大跃进以来，我们苗圃在党和上级的正确领导和关怀下，在改革育苗工具方面取得了一些成绩。我们前后共创造和改进的工具，目前已用于生产的有二十一种，其中有整地、作床工具三种，播种工具三种，抚育工具六种，起苗工具三种，其他还有切条器、拔橛器等六种。再加上引用农业上的耕、耙、压、铲、趟等新式畜力农具，基本上使半机械化的育苗工具配成了套，实现了育苗作业的半机械化。
    由于工具的不断改革和新工具的普遍使用，我们苗圃的生产情况发生了很大的变化，劳动生产率和作业质量都比过去大大提高，而劳动强度和生产成本却降低了很多。拿播种来说，过去完全是手工撒籽，在播种某些树种的时候，还必须用人工抬着筛子在地里筛沙复土；而现在用垅作播种机播种，两个人操作，一天就可播种一公顷，提高工效十一倍。田间管理，过去单靠小手耙和小刀除草、松土，现在有了各种中耕、松土工具，不仅效率比原来提高三到六倍，同时还有利于适期管理，控制杂草生长。起苗，是苗圃里用工最多，劳动强度最大，并且技术性较强的。过去用大镐起苗，虽然磨破了手掌，累得晚上上不了炕，但是一人一天还起不了一分地。现在有了起苗犁，用畜力牵引，四人、四马一天就能起苗十亩多；用拖拉机牵引三个人操作，一天能起苗二十七亩。同时作业质量显著提高，损苗率由过去5％降低到0．1％以下，每公顷可减少五万多株苗木的损失。特别是在起果树苗上，减少树苗损失的效果尤其显著。
    我们苗圃在工具改革方面所以取得一些成就，最重要的是由于党的正确领导和亲切关怀。几年来我们在改革工具上每做出了一点成绩，都受到县、省和中央的奖励（四次集体奖励，半数左右的职工受到了名誉或物质奖励）。这是对我们的莫大鼓舞，也是对我们的深刻教育。此外，党和上级还不断给予我们具体指导和支持。去年3月间，在劳力十分紧张的情况下，北镇县的县委书记亲自批准我们成立工具修配小组，配备铁、木工人四名，还给我们解决了没有废钢材的问题。在我们研究起苗犁时，县农林局刘焕章副局长亲自到现场来鼓励我们不要怕失败。这一切都激发了职工的创造热情，鼓舞大家越干劲头越大。
    从生产出发，土法上马，由小到大，由简到繁，不断改进提高。这是改革工具的一条简捷而正确的道路。我们创造和改进的每一件工具，差不多都是由小的、土的开始，经过试验，在生产中不断改进提高。如我们创造的播种机，一开始仅是个五齿条播耙，但比旧工具提高工效二倍多。我们使用它在播种地开沟时，又产生了自动下种的念头，后来，参照农业播种机的排种原理，终于制成了五行条播机。以后随着施业规格的改变，我们又把它改制成垅作播种机。去春，又参照黑山县苗圃创造的翅果播种机，经综合设计，改成了比较完整的，既能播种中粒种子，又能播种翅果种子的垅作播种机。
    在工具改革中，困难是很多的，其中最主要的是科学知识少，原料和设备缺乏。但是这些困难我们在党的领导下，不断克服了。缺乏科学知识，我们就多从实际中摸索，多注意观察农业机具的构造，本着用啥学啥的精神找参考材料看。如我们在初期研究起苗犁时，发现犁铧不下土，扶不正，我们就一面分析实践中发生的问题，一边找书看。终于从一本“洋犁”小册子里找出犁不入土的毛病。为了解决原料和设备不足的问题，我们就经常搜集废旧物资。旧水车、旧农具、废铁、自行车旧零件等，都是我们改革和制造工具的好材料。
    我们虽然取得了上述成绩，但是距离实际要求还很远。1960年，我们要在已有的基础上，根据生产不断发展的需要，在进一步开展育苗工作中，研究育苗工具机械化的问题。我们一定继续贯彻党的八届八中全会精神，更高地举起工具改革的红旗，把林业生产上的技术革新，从一个高峰推向另一个高峰。
