Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin. Commercial departments in cotton-producing areas of Hebei Province have further strengthened their mobile procurement work, based on the characteristic of relatively dispersed cotton storage in the later stages of cotton procurement.

In the main cotton-producing areas of Handan, Shijiazhuang, and Baoding prefectures, there are now more than 27,000 staff participating in cotton procurement. In thirteen counties, including Yongnian, Quzhou, Neiqiu, Ningjin, and Hengshui, in addition to all existing 2,300-plus cotton procurement outlets, 3,095 mobile procurement teams have been organized, taking funds, scales, transportation tools, and supplies to production teams, canteens, and commune members' homes for procurement. In Yongnian County, the 261 mobile procurement teams procured more than 247,000 jin of cotton in just two days, February 3rd and 4th. The Baixiang Central Store of Neiqiu County sent personnel with supplies for mobile procurement and supply. They procured cotton and supplied goods in Nansun Village production team, which was welcomed by the commune members. The Zhang Ao Central Store of Wuqiao County set up twenty-three procurement points in the eight villages of the Dadao Management Area and organized seventy-two mobile procurement teams to go from village to village for procurement, procuring 14,700 jin in one day.

After the Spring Festival, people's communes in cotton-producing areas of Hebei Province further publicized the cotton procurement policy to commune members, who actively sold surplus cotton to the state to support industrial production. After Yongnian County's Hesha Town Commune publicized the policy to commune members, it sold 54,000 jin of cotton on February 4th, an increase of more than five times compared to the 3rd. Since the beginning of February, the province's cotton procurement volume has increased several times compared to the period before the Spring Festival.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou. People's communes in various parts of Henan Province have launched another upsurge of concentrated cotton sales around the Spring Festival. In the old cotton-producing area of Xinxiang Prefecture, from January 31st to February 4th, the cotton sold to the state each day by the communes increased by nearly two times the average daily procurement volume of the previous period. In the new cotton-producing area of Kaifeng Prefecture, the communes fully tapped their potential and strived to sell more. The daily cotton sales volume after the Spring Festival exceeded that of all other prefectures in the province. Many key cotton-producing counties and cities that had already over-fulfilled the state procurement tasks also took active steps to strive for more over-fulfillment.

Henan Province achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of cotton last year. By mid-January of this year, the cotton procured throughout the province exceeded the total procurement volume of the previous year. The quality of the cotton was also very good, with higher grades and lower moisture and impurity content than the cotton procured in previous years.

At present, many accounting units, contracted units, and cotton farmers still have a considerable amount of commercial cotton that needs to be sold. In order to seize the time to sell this batch of cotton to the state, expand this year's production investment, and support industrial production at the same time, another upsurge of concentrated cotton sales has recently been launched throughout the province. Party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership, and many areas have adopted the method of reporting, inspecting, weighing, and paying all at the same time through convening commune member representative meetings for procurement. Fuji Commune in ? County reported more than 200,000 jin of remaining seed cotton on January 31st alone, immediately weighing and putting 144,300 jin into storage, and then immediately organizing 175 carts to send it to the ginnery. During the Spring Festival, Cixuzhai Commune in Hua County combined cultural and recreational publicity activities with organizing the masses to sell cotton, selling more than 12,000 jin in three days. Qinyang County had already over-fulfilled the 1959 procurement task by 20,000 jin of ginned cotton at the end of last year. In the ten days before the Spring Festival, the county concentratedly procured nearly 50,000 jin of ginned cotton. The Wulou Brigade of the Kuanhan Commune in Nanle County organized 2,000 people during the Spring Festival to pick more than 25,000 jin of seed cotton from 1,455 mu of cotton stalks and immediately sold it all to the state.

    加强流动收购　力争更多超额
    河北河南抓紧收购棉花
    新华社天津电　河北省各产棉区商业部门，根据棉花收购工作后期存棉比较分散的特点，进一步加强了流动收购工作。
    主要产棉区邯郸、石家庄、保定三个专区，现在参加棉花收购工作的职工有二万七千多人。永年、曲周、内丘、宁晋、衡水等十三个县，除了原有的两千三百多个棉花收购门市部都收购以外，还组织了三千零九十五个流动收购组，带款、带秤、带运输工具、带供应的物资，到生产队、食堂和社员家庭去收购。永年县的二百六十一个流动收购组在2月3、4两天内就收购了棉花二十四万七千多斤。内丘县柏乡中心商店派人带物资流动收购和供应，在南孙村生产队一面收购棉花，一面供应商品，受到社员们的欢迎。吴桥县张熬中心商店大道管理区八个村设立了二十三个收购点，又组织了七十二个流动收购组串村串户收购，一天收购了一万四千七百斤。
    春节以后，河北省各产棉区人民公社向社员们进一步宣传了棉花收购政策，社员们纷纷将多余的棉花卖给国家，支援工业生产。永年县河沙镇公社向社员宣传以后，在2月4日一天就出售了五万四千斤棉花，比3日增加五倍多。2月上旬以来，全省棉花收购量比春节以前一个时期成倍地增加。
    新华社郑州电　河南省各地人民公社在春节前后又掀起了一个突击售棉高潮。老产棉区新乡专区各公社，从1月31日到2月4日，每天向国家出售的棉花，比前一时期的平均日收购量增加了将近两倍。新产棉区开封专区各公社充分挖掘潜力，争取多卖，春节以后每日售棉量超过全省各专区。许多已经超额完成了国家收购任务的重点产棉县、市也积极行动，争取更多地超额。
    河南省去年的棉花获得了空前大丰收。到今年1月中旬，全省收购的棉花超过了上一年度收购量的总和；棉花质量也很好，等级比往年高，含水量和含杂量比往年收购的棉花为低。
    目前，许多核算单位、包产单位和棉农手里，都还有相当数量的商品棉花需要出售。为了抓紧时间把这批棉花卖给国家，扩大今年的生产投资，同时支援工业生产；各地最近又掀起了突击售棉高潮。各地党委都加强了领导，许多地区通过召开社员代表会，采取边报、边验收、边过秤、边付款的办法收购。?县符集公社在1月31日一天即报出存余籽棉二十多万斤，立即过秤入库十四万四千三百斤，紧接着组织大车一百七十五辆送往轧花厂。滑县慈修砦公社在春节期间结合文娱宣传活动，组织群众售棉，三天便出售了一万二千多斤。沁阳县在去年年底已经超额二万斤皮棉完成了1959年度的收购任务，在春节前十天这个县又突击收购了皮棉近五万斤。南乐县宽韩公社五楼大队在春节期间组织了二千人，在一千四百五十五亩棉柴上拣摘了籽棉二万五千多斤，立即全部卖给了国家。
