Short commentary:

A Hide and a Hair Matter Greatly

Everything has a different status in different eras. From steel, coal, grain, and cotton to a hide and a hair, it is all the same.

In the old society, in the eyes of ordinary people, a hide and a hair were merely resources for making leather, brushes, fur coats, pens, and felt. No one considered that they could have more uses. At that time, some merchants who purchased hides and furs only proceeded from personal profit, and had no concept of serving production and life. As a result, a large amount of useful materials were scattered everywhere and became waste products.

Are chicken feathers and garlic peels really insignificant? The view in the new era is exactly the opposite. In the socialist era, a hide and a hair are all components of socialist construction. The waste and loss of a hide and a hair is a waste of materials for socialist production and construction; while the collection of a hide and a hair adds material strength to production and construction. For example, pig bristles and horsehair are the best raw materials for making suit interlinings, sieve bottoms, and various industrial brushes; many wild animal furs have always been used to make coats, hats, and fur collars, and now many wool mills have used rabbit hair to weave the best clothing materials and woolen yarn. Even pig hair can be turned into raw materials for making clothes. In the past, many things seemed insignificant at first glance, but a closer look reveals that they are an important wealth. One ton of pig bristles is equivalent to the value of twenty tons of pork; the value of one ton of cashmere is equivalent to the value of thirty-one tons of rice; the value of one ton of white goose down is equal to the value of thirty tons of soybeans. As the saying goes, "Many a little makes a mickle," this saying is a very appropriate metaphor to describe the great significance of animal products.

Now is the peak season for the production of animal products. Although animal husbandry business departments in various places have purchased a lot of useful things, there is still great potential to be tapped; especially in mountainous areas with inconvenient transportation, the potential is even greater. Commercial and foreign trade departments in various places should make full use of the great opportunity to actively purchase animal products, ensuring that not a single hide is lost and not a single hair is missed.

In the socialist era, many things must be re-evaluated, and new evaluations and new treatment must be given to a hide and a hair. A hair and a hide matter greatly. Therefore, it is an important task for animal husbandry producers and animal product business departments to attach importance to the production and collection of animal products, mobilize the masses, and get everyone involved in collecting all kinds of things, whether wild or domestic animals; plant or animal products; valuable or not very valuable, in a planned and organized manner.

### 一皮一毛关系重大

    一皮一毛关系重大
    一切事物，在不同的时代，有不同的地位。大至钢、煤、粮、棉，小至一皮一毛，都是如此。
    一皮一毛，在旧社会一般人的眼光里，不过是制革、制刷、制裘、制笔和制毡的资源。谁也没有考虑它会有更多的用途。当时，一些收购皮毛产品的商人，仅仅从个人赢利出发，根本没有为生产为生活服务的观点，以至大量有用的物资，散失各地，成为废品。
    鸡毛蒜皮真是无足轻重的东西吗？新时代的观点恰恰和此相反。在社会主义时代，一皮一毛，都是社会主义建设的构成部分。一皮一毛的浪费和散失，就是社会主义生产建设的物资浪费；而一皮一毛的收集，就为生产建设增加了物质力量。例如，猪鬃、马尾就是做西服衬布、箩底和各种工业用刷的最好原料；许多野牲毛皮一向都是用来做大衣、帽子和皮领的，现在很多毛纺厂已经用兔毛纺织成最好的衣料和绒线。甚至猪毛也可以变成做衣服的原料。过去有很多东西，粗看起来好像是算不了什么的，但，细算一下，却是一笔重要的财富。一吨猪鬃相当于二十吨猪肉的价值；一吨羊绒的价值，相当于三十一吨大米的价值；一吨白鹅毛等于三十吨大豆的价值。俗话说：“集腋成裘”，这句话来形容畜产品的重大意义，确是很恰当的比喻。
    现在，正是畜产品生产的旺季。虽然各地畜产业务部门已经收购了不少有用的东西，但是，还有很大潜力可挖；特别是交通不便的山区，潜力更大。各地商业和外贸部门应该充分利用大好时机，积极收购畜产品。做到一皮不丢，一毛不漏。
    社会主义的时代，许多事物都要做新的估价，对于一皮一毛，也要给以新的估价，新的待遇。一毛一皮，关系重大。所以，重视畜产品生产和搜集工作，发动群众，大家动手，不论是野牲，家牲；植物的，动物的；值钱的和不很值钱的，通统有计划、有组织地收集起来。这是畜牧业生产者和畜产业务部门的重要任务。
