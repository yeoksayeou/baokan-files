How to Make Major Technical Innovation Projects Achieve Faster and Better?
    Rely on Collective Wisdom Rely on Communist Style
    “Three-Combination” Organizations and “Pacesetter Regiments” in Chongqing Factories Promote Rapid Development of Technical Innovation Movement
    More Than 10,000 Manual Operations Changed to Mechanical Operations in Two Months, and More Than 100 Automatic Production Lines Established
    (Our newspaper Chongqing, February 19th dispatch) Chongqing's mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, is developing rapidly with the force of ten thousand horses galloping. 700,000 workers in the city have invested in this movement. As of February 5th, according to incomplete statistics, more than 13,400 manual operations in the city have been changed to mechanical operations, with 106 automatic production lines and 1,500 automated single machines appearing. Before November of last year, the city had only two automatic production lines, and manual operations in various mechanical factories generally accounted for about 50%. At present, 32% of manual operations have achieved semi-mechanization, mechanization, or semi-automation and automation, production efficiency has increased by several times to dozens of times, and workers' working conditions have also improved significantly.

    In the fourth quarter of last year, especially since the beginning of this year, Chongqing's technical innovation and technical revolution movement has rapidly developed towards a new stage from simple to complex, from low-level to high-level, from reforming general tools to vigorously engaging in mechanization and semi-mechanization. Many relatively complex innovation projects are difficult to achieve by relying on individual strength alone. Therefore, the broad masses of workers further carried forward the spirit of collectivism, and various "three-combination" organizations were universally established throughout the city under the leadership of the Party committee and workshop branches. According to incomplete statistics from 44 factories, there are more than 3,200 three-combination organizations composed of workers, leaders, and technicians in the city, with more than 49,000 workers participating. They fully exerted collective wisdom and strength, enabling many relatively difficult innovation projects to be realized quickly and well. In the innovation of realizing the linkage of five automatic machine tools in the lathe workshop of the Chongqing Switch Factory, the members of the three-combination team each brought their strengths into play. Lu Jinchun, a technician familiar with electrical principles, was responsible for designing the electric control equipment, and a group of workers familiar with transmission machinery were engaged in the design of transmission equipment, and then the whole group jointly studied and revised it. During the construction and test run, it was found that the original use of perforated tape as transmission equipment was unsuitable. Liu Zhengming, a leading cadre participating in the three-combination team, and advanced worker Chen Fangrong, etc., repeatedly studied and changed to drum wheel transmission; everyone further revised and supplemented, and further improved the parts of the drum wheel. In this way, from design to construction and test run, the whole group of workers continuously collectively studied and improved, so that the linkage of the five machine tools was realized within thirteen days.

    For the realization of many larger and more complex innovation projects, such as automatic production lines and multi-variety linked automatic control, even the collective strength of a group, section, or even a workshop is difficult to complete. Therefore, when many factories and mining enterprises realize these major innovation projects, they mostly mobilize technical strength and leadership strength from the whole workshop and the whole factory to form a stronger collective research and experimentation and construction organization to make it realize quickly. When the Fifth Workshop of the Air Compressor Factory realized the automatic screw production line, a secretary of the factory Party committee personally took charge. In addition to the technical strength of the workshop, the factory department also transferred the famous innovation experts Li Bingzhong and Zhao Jiacai, and technicians drawn from the power section, tool section and other departments, a total of more than 70 people, to form a scientific research institute. Thanks to the exertion of collective wisdom and strength, this automatic line was realized in a few days.

    Many famous technical innovation experts, in order to realize increasingly major and complex innovation projects faster and better, have organized and established organizations such as pacesetter regiments and vanguard teams, and exerted collective strength to carry out innovation. After more than 30 pacesetters of the Chang'an Machine Factory organized, they solved more than 1,300 key projects in the factory in just a few months. In the past, the supply section had not made a cold drawing machine in more than a year. After the establishment of the pacesetter regiment, pacesetters from various types of work such as vehicle, fitter, milling, and planer in the whole factory collectively cooperated, and it only took more than a month to make it. After many pacesetters and innovation experts organized, because the conditions for mutual research and mutual cooperation were better, the individual innovation suggestions were also realized faster and better than in the past. The nationally famous innovation expert and milling worker Wei Gaohou participated in the pacesetter regiment. With the help of other pacesetters, he realized 103 innovation projects in only one month this year, completing the workload equivalent to five years and seven months.

### 如何使重大技术革新项目实现得更快更好？  靠集体智慧  靠共产主义风格

    如何使重大技术革新项目实现得更快更好？
    靠集体智慧  靠共产主义风格
    重庆工厂“三结合”组织和“标兵团”促使技术革新运动迅猛展开
    两个多月使一万多项手工操作变为机械操作，建立了一百多条生产自动线
    本报重庆19日电　重庆市以机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，正以万马奔腾之势迅猛展开。全市有七十万名职工投入了这一运动。到2月5日为止，据不完全统计，全市已经有一万三千四百多项手工操作改为机械操作，出现生产自动线一百零六条，自动化单机一千五百多台。而去年11月以前，这个市还只有两条生产自动线，各机械厂手工操作一般占50％左右。目前，有32％的手工操作已经实现了半机械化、机械化或者半自动化、自动化，生产效率提高了几倍到几十倍，工人的劳动条件也显著改善。
    去年第四季度特别是今年以来，重庆市的技术革新和技术革命运动，迅速地向着由简到繁、由低级到高级、由改革一般工具到大搞机械化、半机械化的新阶段发展，许多比较复杂的革新项目，单靠个人力量已难于实现。因此，广大职工进一步发扬了集体主义精神，各种“三结合”组织在党委、车间支部领导下，在全市普遍建立起来。据四十四个工厂的不完全统计，全市由工人、领导、技术人员组成的三结合组织，就有三千二百多个，参加的职工有四万九千多人。他们充分发挥集体智慧和力量，使许多比较繁难的革新项目，又快又好地实现了。重庆开关厂车工车间在实现五部自动机床联动化的革新中，三结合小组的成员各自发挥特长，熟悉电器原理的技术员吕锦春，负责设计电动控制设备，一批熟悉传动机械的工人搞传动设备的设计，然后由全组共同研究修改。在施工试车中，发现原来用穿孔带作传动设备不合用，参加三结合小组的领导干部刘正明和先进工人陈方蓉等反复研究，改用鼓轮传动；大家又修改补充，把鼓轮的零件再加改进。这样从设计到施工试车，都由全组职工不断集体研究改进，使五部机床联动化在十三天内就实现了。
    对于实现许多更大更复杂的革新项目，如生产自动线、多品种联机自动控制等，即使一个小组、工段、甚至一个车间的集体力量，也难于完成。因此，许多厂矿企业在实现这些重大革新项目时，大都从全车间、全厂范围内调动技术力量和领导力量，组成更强大的集体研究试验和施工组织，使之迅速实现。空气压缩机厂第五车间在实现螺丝生产自动线时，厂党委的一位书记亲自挂帅，除了车间的技术力量以外，厂部还抽调了著名革新能手李秉中、赵家才和从动力科、工具科等部门抽调技术员，共七十多人组成科学研究所。由于发挥了集体智慧和力量，这条自动线在几天中就实现了。
    许多著名的技术革新能手，为了更快更好地实现越来越重大复杂的革新项目，纷纷组织起来，成立了标兵团、尖兵队等组织，发挥集体力量进行革新。长安机器厂三十多个标兵组织起来以后，在短短几个月内就解决了厂内的关键项目一千三百多个。过去，这个供应科一年多都没有把冷拉机制成。标兵团成立以后，全厂的车、钳、铣、刨等各工种的标兵集体配合，只用了一个多月时间就制成了。许多标兵和革新能手组织起来以后，因为互相研究和互相协作的条件更好，使个人的革新建议也比过去实现得更快更好了。全国著名的革新能手、铣工魏高厚参加标兵团，在其他标兵帮助下，今年只用一个月的时间就实现了革新项目一百零三项，完成了相当于五年零七个月的工作量。
