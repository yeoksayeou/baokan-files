Continuous Grain Storage, Transportation, and Processing
Loading and Unloading Efficiency Increased More Than Thirty Times

    (Our dispatch) The workers of the Eighth District Grain Processing Factory in Harbin created two continuous automatic lines for grain storage, transportation, and processing, realizing the continuous and automatic process of unloading, transporting, processing, and warehousing of grains such as millet and corn from the raw grain, ending the factory's thirty-year history of manual unloading and transportation. According to preliminary assessments, the use of this automatic line reduced the number of loading and unloading workers from the original 257 to 8, and the loading and unloading efficiency increased more than 30 times compared to the past. The vehicle stop time was shortened by three-fifths compared to the past. This not only reduced production costs, but also accelerated vehicle turnover, creating good conditions for the sustained and comprehensive Great Leap Forward in production and transportation.

    粮食储运加工连续化
    装卸效率提高三十多倍
    本报讯　哈尔滨八区粮谷加工厂职工创制了两条粮食储运加工连续自动线，使小米、玉米等从原粮卸车、搬运到加工、入库全部实现了连续化、自动化，结束了这个厂沿袭三十年之久的人工卸车、搬运的历史。据初步鉴定，使用这种自动线，装卸工人由原来二百五十七人减少到八人，装卸效率比过去提高三十倍以上，车辆站停时间比过去缩短五分之三，不仅降低了生产成本，而且加快了车辆周转，给生产和交通运输工作实现持续全面大跃进创造了良好的条件。
