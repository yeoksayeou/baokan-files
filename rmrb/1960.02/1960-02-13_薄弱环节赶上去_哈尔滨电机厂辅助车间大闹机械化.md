    Catch Up on Weak Links
    Harbin Electrical Machinery Plant's Auxiliary Workshops Make Great Strides in Mechanization

    (By our reporter) The Harbin Electrical Machinery Plant, in its technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and in response to the situation where the production capacity of auxiliary workshops was lower than that of finished product workshops, is using even greater efforts to vigorously promote mechanization and automation in auxiliary workshops. This will break through weak links in production, gradually balance the production capacity of auxiliary workshops and finished product workshops, and ensure sustained and comprehensive leaps forward in the factory's overall production.

    The Harbin Electrical Machinery Plant is one of the most modern factories in China's electrical machinery manufacturing industry. The production equipment in the finished product workshops are all new mechanized and automated equipment, with great production potential. After two years of the Great Leap Forward, by October of last year, the actual production capacity of the finished product workshops had already exceeded the design level of the factory's second-phase project by 15%. However, the auxiliary workshops, where manual operation was a significant proportion, had already reached their designed quotas in terms of the actual number of production workers, but still could not keep up with the development needs of the finished product workshops. In November of last year, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the factory formed a new high tide. The finished product workshops saw the emergence of automated screw production lines and the realization of single-machine automation for operations such as rotor slot wedge blanking and worm gear washing, increasing production capacity by five to ten times respectively. The production capacity of the auxiliary workshops was even less able to meet the needs of the finished product workshops. The factory's Party committee, based on this contradiction in production, decided to mobilize the workers to vigorously promote mechanization and automation in the auxiliary workshops. Through airing of views and debates, the workers criticized viewpoints such as "it is unavoidable that auxiliary workshops have more manual operation" and "manual operation is better than machinery for manufacturing coils." A vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement was launched.

    The workers of the auxiliary workshops worked hard and cleverly, making great innovations; the office staff and various workshops also gave their full support. Taking the coal conveying automation line as an example, as soon as the boiler workshop proposed this technical innovation project, the casting workshop, governor workshop, repair workshop, and power workshop gave various kinds of support; the engineering and technical personnel in the offices rushed to design blueprints. In this way, this coal conveying automation line, composed of more than 15,000 parts, 150 meters long, and more than 30 tons in total weight, capable of autonomously extending and contracting to contact coal piles, and also quite precise, was built in only thirty days.

  In just over two months, the auxiliary workshops realized a large number of technical innovation projects. Sixty-five manual operations in various auxiliary workshops were semi-mechanized or mechanized, and at the same time, five single-machine automation and three automated production lines were realized. The proportion of manual operation in auxiliary workshops decreased from 45% in the past to 32% at present, and the proportion of mechanized processing increased from 55% in the past to 68%. This has powerfully guaranteed the development of production in the finished product workshops. In the past, the main product workshops often could not assemble and ship motors on time because the coil supply could not keep up, even though all the motor parts were ready. Now, after vigorously promoting mechanization and automation, the coil workshop has created two automated production lines: the insertion type coil for AC motor rotors and the coil for DC armatures, reducing the time per piece from three minutes to five seconds, increasing efficiency by about thirty times. This has enabled the coil output to basically meet the needs of several major product workshops. The tool workshop, which is responsible for supplying the entire factory's jigs and tools, created surface grinders, caliper grinders, and other equipment, greatly improving work efficiency. Now, this workshop has partially changed the situation of "doing this month's work this month" and is able to prepare some tools for the finished product workshops one or two months in advance. The automatic lathe control instrument manufactured by the repair workshop, the coal conveying automation line created by the boiler workshop, the automated silicon steel sheet deburring and painting production line created by the stamping and shearing workshop, and other innovations have also significantly improved production efficiency.

    After this stage of innovation, the auxiliary workshops have also saved a lot of labor, which has supported the finished product workshops. For example, after the boiler workshop had the coal conveying automation line, the number of workers was reduced from 150 per day in three shifts to 30 people, and the saved workers are gradually being transferred to other production workshops that urgently need labor.

    薄弱环节赶上去
    哈尔滨电机厂辅助车间大闹机械化
    本报讯　哈尔滨电机厂在技术革新和技术革命运动中，针对辅助车间生产能力低于成品车间生产能力的状况，用更大力量在辅助车间大搞机械化、自动化，突破生产薄弱环节，使辅助车间的生产能力和成品车间逐步求得平衡，保证全厂生产持续全面地跃进。
    哈尔滨电机厂是我国电机制造工业中最现代化的工厂之一。成品车间的生产设备都是全新的机械化、自动化设备，生产潜力很大。经过两年的大跃进，到去年10月间，成品车间实际生产能力已经超过这个厂二期工程设计水平的15％。而手工操作比重很大的辅助车间，实际生产工人数目已达到了设计定额，但还赶不上成品车间发展的需要。去年11月，这个厂的技术革新和技术革命运动形成新高潮，成品车间又出现了螺钉自动化生产线，实现了转子槽楔下料、洗蜗轮等单机自动化，生产能力分别提高五倍到十倍，辅助车间的生产能力更不能适应成品车间需要了。这个厂的党委根据生产中的这一矛盾，决定发动职工大搞辅助车间机械化、自动化。职工们通过鸣放辩论，批判了“辅助车间，手工操作多一点是难免的”，“制造线圈，手工操作比机械好”等论点，一个轰轰烈烈的技术革新和技术革命运动开展了起来。
    辅助车间的职工苦干巧干，大闹革新；科室人员、各个车间也全力予以支援。以输煤自动线为例，锅炉车间一提出这个技术革新项目，铸造车间、调速器车间、机修车间和电力车间等就给予了各种支持；科室的工程技术人员突击给设计图纸。这样，这条由一万五千多个部件组成的全长一百五十米、总重三十多吨，能够自行伸缩接触煤堆，而且相当精密的输煤自动化生产线，只用三十天时间就建造成功了。
  前后两个多月的时间，辅助车间就实现了大批技术革新项目。各辅助车间有六十五项手工操作实现了半机械化、机械化，同时实现了五台单机自动化和三条自动化生产线。辅助车间手工操作的比重由过去的45％降低到现在的32％，机械化加工的比重由过去的55％提高到68％。这就有力地保证了成品车间生产的发展。过去，主要产品车间常常因为线圈供应不上，虽然一切电机部件都已准备齐全，但是电机不能按时装配出厂。现在，线圈车间经过大搞机械化、自动化，创造了交电机转子插入式线圈和直流电枢线圈两条自动化生产线，使单件工时从三分钟减少到五秒钟，提高效率三十倍左右。这便使线圈的产量基本上满足了几个主要产品车间的需要。负责供应全厂工卡具的工具车间，创造了平台研磨机、卡尺研磨机等，大大提高了工作效率。现在，这个车间已经部分地改变了“当月活当月作”的情况，能够为成品车间提前一两个月准备一部分工具。机修车间制造的车床自动控制仪，锅炉车间创造的输煤自动化生产线，冲剪车间创造的矽钢片去毛刺刷漆自动化生产线等，也都显著地提高了生产效率。
    经过这个阶段的革新，辅助车间还节省出不少的劳动力，支援成品车间。例如，锅炉车间有了输煤自动化生产线以后，由过去每天三班一百五十名工人减少到三十人，节省出的工人正逐步转到其他急需劳动力的生产车间里去。
