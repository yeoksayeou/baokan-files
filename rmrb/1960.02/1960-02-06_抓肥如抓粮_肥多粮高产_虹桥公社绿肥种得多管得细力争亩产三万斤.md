Grasping Fertilizer Like Grasping Grain; More Fertilizer, Higher Grain Yields
Hongqiao Commune Plants Green Manure Extensively, Manages It Meticulously, Striving for 30,000 Jin per Mu

(Reported by our newspaper) The 38,000 mu of grass seeds (green manure) in Hongqiao Commune, Yueqing County, Zhejiang Province, are growing very vigorously due to early planting and meticulous management, and the signs of an exceptionally large harvest are already appearing. At the end of December last year, the entire commune organized 8,500 people to conduct a major inspection. During the inspection, every field was visited and every plot was assessed. By selecting representative fields (three to five plots per team), counting the number of plants and clumps, classifying and measuring the land, and selecting points for sample weighing, it was found that the average plant height of the 38,000 mu of grass seeds in the commune had reached eight inches, with 10,000 clumps per mu, each clump weighing four liang, and a yield of 4,000 jin per mu. Among them, 1,082 mu yielded more than 10,000 jin per mu, with the entire field green, and the ridges and ditches were no longer visible. Another 8,370 mu had reached or exceeded the average yield of green manure at harvest in 1959 (5,000 jin). The broad masses all said: We have never seen such good spring flowers.

The reason why the grass seeds in Hongqiao Commune are growing so well is that the commune Party committee has vigorously promoted advanced technical measures. After the grass seeds were planted last year, the commune Party committee put forward the slogan "Plant one plot, guarantee one plot, ensure every clump survives, and every plot yields high," and launched a "grass seed yield of 30,000 jin per mu" campaign.

In order to manage the grass seeds well, from leaders to commune members, a system of division of labor and responsibility was implemented. Cadres at all levels of the commune, brigade, and production team were assigned to the teams, divided into areas of responsibility, and strengthened leadership. The entire commune selected 2,660 people to form 575 specialized grass seed cultivation groups, implementing measures to the field, responsibility to the person, and defining personnel, land, work points, fertilization, yield, irrigation and drainage, and reward and punishment management responsibility system. Due to the implementation of leadership and the strengthening of the responsibility system, the labor attendance rate and labor efficiency were greatly improved. After Jianqiang Production Team established the responsibility system, all 142 members were mobilized, and the digging of ditches increased from half a mu per person per day to one mu and one fen, and the task originally scheduled to be completed in five days was completed in two days.

In order to achieve a bumper harvest of grass seeds, the commune members demonstrated soaring enthusiasm in cultivation and management. Recently, due to the changeable weather, more than 14,000 mu of grass seeds in the commune were infected with anthracnose. According to the instructions of the county Party committee, the commune Party committee launched a debate throughout the commune on the topic of "Should we eliminate the disease, can we eliminate the disease?" Combining the experience of the masses, measures such as spraying Ceresan, removing diseased plants to protect healthy clumps, and removing diseased clumps to protect healthy areas were taken to attack and eliminate the disease. The commune organized more than 100 people to go to the teams to help, and the commercial departments delivered medicine to the fields overnight. The commune Party committee called on the radio conference to comprehensively prevent and control the disease, completely eliminate it, not let a single seedling get sick, and not let a single bacterium pass. In two days, 12,800 people were mobilized to cure anthracnose, and in four days, all the grass seeds turned green, and the missing clumps were replanted from vigorous clumps.

In the process of cultivating grass seeds, the teams also established pacesetters and launched a socialist labor competition of "compare, learn, catch up, and help." During the drought resistance and seedling protection, more than 100 people and more than 20 waterwheels in Jianqiang Team worked day and night, irrigating 250 mu of land a day, weeding 180 mu, and applying ash 210 mu, completing all the tasks in two days, with all the seedlings in every plot being healthy and strong. The commune Party committee immediately convened an on-site meeting to promote their experience. The entire commune organized more than 1,000 people to visit Jianqiang Team and launched a "learn from Jianqiang, catch up with Jianqiang, surpass Jianqiang" campaign, which formed a climax of drought resistance and seedling protection in two days. During field management, the commune Party committee promoted the experience of Huitou Team using oxen to plow grass ditches, which doubled labor efficiency, and deepened all the grass field ditches to eight inches in two days. Each team immediately promoted it, and the entire commune mobilized more than 700 oxen and more than 600 people every day to repair drainage ditches. The plains area lacked plowing cattle, so the nine teams in the mountainous area transferred more than 50 plowing cattle to support them. Throughout the field management, the slogan "Third-class seedlings catch up with first-class seedlings, second-class seedlings surpass first-class seedlings, first-class seedlings leap forward again, and strive for 30,000 jin" resounded in every corner. While establishing pacesetters and catching up with advanced ones, the Party organizations at all levels in Hongqiao Commune attached great importance to helping the backward catch up with the advanced. Lianqiao Team planted later, and the growth of grass seeds could not keep up. The three teams around them provided fertilizer support, and the commune also specially supplied 1,000 jin of chemical fertilizer, which greatly encouraged the commune members, and the growth of grass seeds caught up with the advanced team in half a month.

    抓肥如抓粮　肥多粮高产
    虹桥公社绿肥种得多管得细力争亩产三万斤
    本报讯　浙江省乐清县虹桥公社三万八千亩草子（绿肥），由于种得早、管得细，长得十分茂盛，特大丰收的苗头已经出现。去年12月底全社组织八千五百人，开展了一次大检查。检查中片片跑到，丘丘鉴定。通过选择代表田（每个队三到五丘）点株数丛、划类丈量、选点抽秤，全社三万八千亩草子，一般株高已达八寸，每亩一万丛，每丛重四两，亩产四千斤。其中有一千零八十二亩，亩产一万斤以上，满畈一片绿，已经看不到草垅草沟。另有八千三百七十亩，亩产已达到或超过1959年绿肥收获时的平均亩产量（五千斤）。广大群众都说：这么好的春花，从未见过。
    虹桥公社草子长得这样好，是公社党委大抓先进技术措施的结果。去年草子种好以后，公社党委提出“种一丘，保一丘，丛丛成活，丘丘高产”的口号，开展了“草子亩产三万斤”运动。
    为了管好草子，从领导到社员，实行分线分业。公社、大队、生产队各级干部层层落实到队，分片包干，加强领导。全社选择二千六百六十人，组成五百七十五个草子培育专业小组，实行措施到田，责任到人，定人员、定地段、定工分、定施肥、定产量、定排水灌水、定奖惩的管理责任制。由于领导落实，责任制加强，劳动出勤率、劳动效率大大地提高了。建强生产队在建立责任制后，全部出动，达到一百四十二人，开沟由每人每日半亩跃升到一亩一分，原定五天完成的任务两天就完成了。
    为了实现草子特大丰收，社员们在培育管理中表现了冲天干劲。最近，由于天气多变，全社有一万四千多亩草子染上炭疽病。社党委根据县委指示，就“要不要扑灭病害，能不能扑灭病害”为题在全公社开展辩论，结合群众的经验，采取喷射赛力散、拔株保丛、拔丛保片等办法，突击扑灭病害。公社组织一百多人下队帮助，商业部门连夜送药到田头。社党委在广播大会上号召全面防治，彻底扑灭，不让一根苗受病，不让一菌过关。两天出动一万二千八百人次，治好了炭疽病，四天草子全部转青，有缺丛的也从旺丛分栽补足。
    各队在培育草子过程中，还大立标兵，大闹“比、学、赶、帮”的社会主义劳动竞赛。在抗旱保苗时，建强队一百多人、二十多部水车日夜不停，一天灌水二百五十亩，铲草行一百八十亩，摸灰二百十亩，两天全部完成，丘丘苗全苗壮。社党委立即召开现场会，推广他们的经验。全社组织一千多人到建强队参观，开展“学建强，赶建强，超建强”运动，两天就形成抗旱保苗高潮。在田间管理时，社党委推广了汇头队牛犁草沟，劳动效率提高一倍，两天就把全部草田沟开深到八寸的经验，各队立即推广，全社每天出动七百多头牛、六百多人，整修排水沟。平原地区开沟缺乏耕牛，山区九个队就调出耕牛五十余头支援。在整个田间管理中，“三类苗赶一类苗，二类苗超一类苗，一类苗再跃进，力争三万斤”的口号响彻每一个角落。在立标兵、赶先进的同时，虹桥公社各级党组织十分重视帮助落后赶上先进。连桥队因种得较迟，草子生长赶不上，周围三个队就以肥料支援，公社也特别供应化肥一千斤，对社员们鼓舞很大，草子生长半个月就赶上先进队。
