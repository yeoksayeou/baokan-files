Using Zhuyin to Eliminate Illiteracy Quickly, Economically, and Effectively
Wanrong County, Shanxi Province Creates a Good Experience in Eliminating Illiteracy

(Reported by this newspaper) Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, has accelerated the progress of eliminating illiteracy by vigorously promoting Zhuyin literacy education. This has enabled the vast majority of people to obtain timely consolidation and rapid improvement after becoming literate, thereby permanently freeing themselves from illiteracy. Through Zhuyin literacy education, Mandarin Chinese has been preliminarily popularized among young and middle-aged people. In order to promote Wanrong's experience, the Shanxi Provincial Department of Education and the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League held a field conference in Wanrong from December 27, 1959, to January 4, 1960, on promoting Zhuyin literacy education and popularizing Mandarin Chinese in Shanxi Province. After the field conference, the Zhuyin literacy education movement has been launched throughout the Jinan area. In provinces (autonomous regions) such as Anhui, Hubei, Heilongjiang, and Inner Mongolia, a Zhuyin literacy education movement is surging, with the aim of learning from and catching up with Wanrong.

In addition to propaganda and cultural and educational cadres from various regions (prefectures), cities, and counties in Shanxi Province, participants in the Wanrong field conference included representatives from fourteen provinces (autonomous regions), including Jiangsu, Fujian, Anhui, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Hebei, Henan, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Hubei, totaling more than 600 people. Ye Lai Shi, Deputy Director of the Chinese Writing Reform Committee, and Zhang Minshan, Deputy Director of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Education, attended the conference.

Wanrong County's Zhuyin literacy work began during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Over the past year or so, under the leadership of the county party committee, the county has closely integrated literacy efforts with production and vigorously launched a mass movement of Zhuyin literacy education, thereby completing the county's task of eliminating illiteracy ahead of schedule and consolidating and expanding the achievements of literacy education in a timely manner. After becoming literate, the vast number of farmers read books and newspapers, learned technology, and wrote poems and essays, thereby promoting production and greatly changing people's spiritual outlook. The county is currently running large-scale spare-time education, continuing to use pinyin letters in spare-time schools to accelerate progress and improve teaching quality.

Through on-site visits, the participating representatives greatly emancipated their minds and unified their understanding. First of all, everyone unanimously agreed that the view that "literacy has come to an end, and Zhuyin literacy education is no longer needed" is incorrect. Literacy work must be considered in terms of consolidation and improvement. Wanrong's experience proves that Zhuyin literacy education is a good way to consolidate and expand literacy achievements. Therefore, it is entirely necessary to propose Zhuyin literacy education now. Secondly, everyone believes that the view that "pinyin letters are difficult to learn, and teaching pinyin letters will increase the burden on students" is also unfounded. Wanrong County's experience proves that even children and the elderly can skillfully use pinyin letters, and ordinary young and middle-aged farmers can learn them completely. Pinyin letters are a tool for recognizing characters quickly, economically, and effectively, which can improve literacy efficiency and will not increase the burden on students.

The conference also discussed the issue of popularizing Mandarin Chinese and exchanged experiences on this work. The meeting believes that popularizing Mandarin Chinese is an important political task, and for Shanxi Province, where dialects are relatively complex, it is especially necessary to vigorously promote it. To this end, it is necessary to carry out extensive publicity, vigorously advocate it, reduce resistance, and create a social atmosphere conducive to the promotion of Mandarin Chinese. Schools are an important front for popularizing Mandarin Chinese, and schools at all levels should attach importance to the teaching of pinyin letters and Mandarin Chinese. In order to teach Mandarin Chinese well, it is also necessary to seize the training and improvement of teachers.

Many school representatives pointed out in their speeches at the conference that after teaching pinyin letters in primary schools, not only is Mandarin Chinese learned well, but also the efficiency of Chinese character teaching, reading ability, and writing ability are improved.

During the conference, the representatives witnessed the gratifying phenomenon that Wanrong farmers truly and permanently escaped from illiteracy through reading a large number of Zhuyin reading materials. Many representatives studied pinyin letters early and late, and telegraphed, called, and wrote letters to report the situation and arrange work.

From January 9th to 10th, Zhao Yuting, First Secretary of the Jinan Prefectural Party Committee, led the first secretaries of various counties (cities) in the area to conduct on-site visits in Wanrong and decided to actively, rapidly, and universally promote Wanrong's experience throughout the area. As of January 15th, 680,000 people in the eighteen cities and counties in Jinan Prefecture (excluding Wanrong) had participated in the study of pinyin letters. The Jinan Prefectural Commissioner's Office organized one million young and middle-aged people to participate in the study during the Spring Festival and mobilized 400,000 primary and secondary school teachers and students in the area to serve as instructors during the winter vacation. The Bengbu and Fuyang Prefectures of Anhui Province held Zhuyin literacy education field conferences in Xiaoxian County and Taihe County on January 20th, respectively, to promote Wanrong's experience. The Zhuyin literacy education movement is rapidly unfolding in 27 cities and counties in the province, of which Xiaoxian, Dangshan, Shexian, Wuhe, and Suxian have entered full-scale promotion. In Hubei Province, a Zhuyin literacy education movement of learning from and catching up with Wanrong is surging in 15 cities and counties, including Wuhan, Xiangfan, Huangshi, Shashi, and Jingshan. The Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Education has decided to formally include pinyin letters in the teaching plan of spare-time primary schools, and has already conducted pilot work in four counties in four prefectures to use pinyin letters to help improve Chinese language teaching in spare-time primary schools. The Education Department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has also decided to teach pinyin letters in the upper grades of elementary schools in all levels of spare-time schools to improve the quality of Chinese language teaching.

    利用注音多快好省地扫除文盲
    山西万荣县创造了扫除文盲的好经验
    本报讯　山西万荣县由于大力推行注音扫盲，加速了扫除文盲的进度；并使广大群众在脱盲之后获得及时巩固和迅速提高，从而永远摆脱了文盲状态。通过注音扫盲，在青壮年中还初步普及了普通话。为了推广万荣的经验，山西省教育厅和共青团山西省委于1959年12月27日至1960年1月4日在万荣召开了山西省推行注音扫盲和推广普通话现场会议。现场会议之后，注音扫盲运动已在晋南专区全区开展。在安徽、湖北、黑龙江、内蒙古等省（自治区），正在掀起一个学万荣、赶万荣的注音扫盲运动热潮。
    参加万荣现场会议的，除山西省各地（专）市、县宣传、文教干部外，还有江苏、福建、安徽、山东、黑龙江、吉林、辽宁、河北、河南、内蒙古、甘肃、陕西、四川、湖北十四省（自治区）的代表，共六百余人。中国文字改革委员会副主任叶籁士、山西省教育厅副厅长张岷山出席了这次会议。
    万荣县的注音扫盲工作，是在1958年大跃进中开展起来的。一年多来，在县委的领导下，密切结合生产，大力开展了注音扫盲的群众运动，因而提前完成了全县扫除文盲的任务，及时巩固和扩大了扫盲成果。广大农民在脱盲之后，人人读书看报，学习技术，写诗作文，从而促进了生产，大大改变了人们的精神面貌。该县目前正在大办业余教育，在业余学校中继续利用拼音字母，以加速进度和提高教学质量。
    与会代表通过现场参观，大大解放了思想，统一了认识。首先大家一致认为，“扫盲已成尾声，注音扫盲用不上了”的看法是不对的。扫盲工作要算巩固账，要算提高账。万荣的经验恰好证明：注音扫盲是巩固和扩大扫盲成果的好办法。因此现在提出注音扫盲是完全必要的。其次，大家认为，“拼音字母难学，教学拼音字母会增加学员负担”的看法也是没有根据的。万荣县的经验证明：连儿童和老人都能熟练运用拼音字母，一般青壮年农民完全可以学会。拼音字母是多快好省地识字的工具，可以提高识字效率，不会增加学员负担。
    大会还讨论了推广普通话问题，并就这项工作交流了经验。会议认为，推广普通话是一项重要的政治任务，对于方言比较复杂的山西省来说，尤其需要大力推广。为此必须进行广泛的宣传，大力的提倡，减少阻力，造成有利于推广普通话的社会风气。学校是推广普通话的重要阵地，各级学校都应该重视拼音字母和普通话的教学工作。为了教好普通话，还必须抓紧教师的训练和提高工作。
    好些学校代表在大会发言中指出，小学教学拼音字母以后，不仅普通话学得好，而且也提高了汉字教学效率、阅读能力和写作能力。
    会议期间，代表们亲眼看到了万荣农民通过大量阅读注音读物真正永远摆脱了文盲状态的可喜现象。许多代表，早起晚睡，学习拼音字母，并纷纷拍电报、打电话、写信回去汇报情况，布置工作。
    1月9日至10日，晋南地委第一书记赵雨亭同志率领该区各县（市）委第一书记在万荣进行了现场参观，决定在全区积极、迅速、普遍推广万荣的经验。至1月15日止，晋南专区十八个市县（万荣除外）已有六十八万人参加了拼音字母的学习。晋南专署在春节期间组织一百万青壮年参加学习，并发动全区四十万中小学师生利用寒假担任包教。安徽省的蚌埠和阜阳两个专区，1月20日分别在萧县和太和县召开注音扫盲现场会议，推广万荣经验。注音扫盲运动正在该省二十七个市县内迅速展开，其中萧县、砀山、歙县、五河、宿县已进入全面推广。在湖北省，一个学万荣、赶万荣的注音扫盲运动正在武汉、襄樊、黄石、沙市、京山等十五个市县掀起高潮。黑龙江省教育厅决定将拼音字母正式列入业余初等学校的教学计划，并已在四个专区的四个县进行在业余初等学校利用拼音字母帮助提高语文教学的试点工作。内蒙古自治区教育厅也已决定在各级业余学校的高小班以上的班级都教拼音字母，以提高语文教学质量。
