Xinhua News Agency, Havana, February 12th (via TASS): Soviet First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Mikoyan, accompanied by Cuban Prime Minister Castro, visited scenic spots on the Isle of Pines on the 10th, where they specifically toured the residence of Cuban national hero José Martí during his exile. Afterwards, they proceeded to Santiago, Cuba's second-largest city.

On the way to Santiago, Castro invited Mikoyan to visit the "Agramonte" cooperative. There, they were warmly welcomed by more than a thousand local residents.

At a rally of local residents welcoming him, Mikoyan conveyed the warm greetings of the Soviet people to the Cuban people and wished them success in achieving their sacred ideal—completing and consolidating Cuba's independence.

In his speech, Castro emphasized that there are broad opportunities for trade between Cuba and the Soviet Union, which can use Cuba's traditional exports in exchange for the machinery Cuba needs. Castro said that only by developing trade with all countries of the world, including trade with the Soviet Union, can Cuba achieve economic independence. He said: We have already achieved political independence, and now we can trade with any country in the world without anyone else's permission.

    米高扬访问古巴合作社
    祝古巴人民在巩固独立的事业中获得成就
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社哈瓦那12日讯：苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬在古巴总理卡斯特罗陪同下在10日到松树岛参观名胜古迹，在那里他们特别参观了古巴民族英雄何塞·马蒂在流放期间的住所。然后前往古巴第二大城圣地亚哥访问。
    在前往圣地亚哥途中，卡斯特罗邀请米高扬参观了“阿格拉蒙特”合作社。在那里他们受到当地一千多居民的热烈欢迎。
    米高扬在当地居民欢迎他的大会上向古巴人民转达了苏联人民的热情的问候，并祝古巴人民在实现自己神圣的理想——完成和巩固古巴独立的事业中取得成就。
    卡斯特罗在发言中着重指出，在古巴和苏联之间有着广泛的机会来开展贸易，这种贸易可以用古巴传统的出口品来换回古巴所必需的机器。卡斯特罗说，只有发展同世界各国的贸易，其中包括同苏联的贸易，古巴才能达到经济独立。他说：我们已经取得了政治独立，现在我们可以同世界任何国家贸易而毋需经别人许可。
