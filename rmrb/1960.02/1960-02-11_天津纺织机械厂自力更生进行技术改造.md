Tianjin, February 10th (Reporter of this newspaper) – The Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory is systematically carrying out technical transformation throughout the factory, creating favorable conditions for continued leaps forward this year.

The main contents of the comprehensive technical transformation of the Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory are: 1. Replacing manual operations with mechanized and semi-mechanized production. In the foundry workshop, which was entirely manual in the past, mechanized and semi-mechanized operations have now reached over 60%. 2. Transforming old equipment. The original belt lathes have been transformed into gear machine tools or automated, continuous equipment. Over the past year, the processing steps for more than 520 major parts in the factory's products have been reduced by about half, production cycles have been generally shortened, and production efficiency has significantly improved. 3. Mass producing both indigenous and foreign machinery to address equipment "shortcomings" and weak links. 4. Based on self-made equipment and the transformation of existing equipment, advanced technologies are widely adopted. For example, after adopting new technologies such as using grinding instead of milling, and using non-cutting processes such as stamping, pressing, rolling, and drawing instead of cutting, the utilization rate of steel materials in the processing of many parts and components has increased by an average of more than 20%.

The Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory is a large enterprise that has gradually developed from small repair shops through mergers and expansions. There are many veteran workers with rich production experience, but the equipment is outdated. Since the Great Leap Forward, the factory has been required to supply large quantities of precision, high-efficiency textile equipment, and the contradiction between objective requirements and outdated technical equipment has become increasingly prominent. To overcome this contradiction, the factory has systematically led the masses to carry out technical transformation of the enterprise, constantly guiding employees with the spirit of continuous revolution to "climb the ladder step by step" and improve various equipment again and again. After the belt lathes in the factory were transformed into high-efficiency gear machine tools, the employees installed pneumatic chucks or spring collets, turning them into semi-automatic machine tools. The wooden pattern section, which had just used various wooden machines to replace planes, axes, and saws, saw the emergence of modern equipment such as iron woodworking planers, woodworking lathes, and electric saws twenty days later.

In the process of technical transformation, this factory has always implemented the principle of self-reliance. What the work section can do is not pushed to the workshop; projects that the workshop can achieve are not dependent on the factory; things that the factory can do are never requested from the state. Since purchased parts are more expensive, the employees manufacture them themselves; when steel is in short supply, waste materials are used extensively. For example, under normal circumstances, to reach the current level of mechanization in the foundry workshop, at least 800 yuan of capital construction investment would be required per ton of castings. However, due to the employees' full utilization of existing materials and waste steel, the average cost was only 170 yuan per ton of castings, and the foundry's production capacity increased from about ten tons per day to more than seventy tons.

Recently, the factory has formulated eighty-three factory-wide transformation plans to improve the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the foundry workshop, and to achieve automation, semi-automation, continuity, speed-up, and advanced technology in processing, so as to further change the technical appearance of the enterprise.

    天津纺织机械厂自力更生进行技术改造
    本报天津10日电　天津纺织机械厂有计划地对全厂实行技术改造，为保证今年继续跃进创造了良好条件。
    天津纺织机械厂进行全面技术改造的主要内容是：一、以机械化、半机械化生产代替手工操作。过去全部是手工操作的铸工车间，目前机械化和半机械化操作已达到60％以上。二、改造旧设备。原来的皮带车床已被改成了齿轮机床或者自动化、连续化的设备。一年多来，全厂产品中有五百二十多种主要零件的加工工序减少了一半左右，生产周期普遍缩短，生产效率显著提高。三、针对设备的“缺门”和薄弱环节，大造洋、土机械。四、在自制设备和改造旧有设备的基础上，广泛采用先进技术。如采用以磨代铣，以冲、压、滚、拉等无切削加工代替切削等新技术以后，许多零件、部件加工时钢铁材料的利用率平均提高20％以上。
    天津纺织机械厂是由小型的修配工厂经过合并、扩建逐步发展起来的大型企业。老工人较多，生产经验丰富，但是设备陈旧落后。大跃进以来，要求这个厂大量供应精密的、高效率的纺织设备，客观的要求同技术装备陈旧的矛盾日益突出。为了克服这个矛盾，工厂有计划地领导群众对企业进行技术改造，经常以不断革命的精神，引导职工“步步上楼”，对各种设备改进再改进。当厂内的皮带车床改成高效率的齿轮机床以后，职工们安装了气动卡盘或弹簧卡具，使它们又变成了半自动化的机床。刚刚用各种木制的机器代替了刨子、斧子、锯子的木型工段，二十天后，又出现了铁制的木工刨床、木工车床和电锯等现代化的设备。
    这个厂在技术改造过程中，始终贯彻了自力更生的原则。工段能够办到的事情，就不推给车间；车间能够实现的项目，便不依赖工厂；工厂能够作到的事，决不向国家伸手。外购件较贵，职工们就自己制造；钢铁不足，就大量利用废旧物资。例如，按照通常情况，铸工车间要达到目前的机械化程度，每吨铸件至少要花八百元左右的基建投资，由于职工们充分利用了现有的物资和废旧钢铁，平均每吨铸件只花了一百七十元，铸工的生产能力却由日产十吨左右提高到七十吨以上。
    最近，这个厂又订出了八十三项全厂性的改造规划，要提高铸工车间机械化、半机械化的程度，要在加工方面实现自动化、半自动化、连续化、快速化和工艺先进化等，进一步改变企业的技术面貌。
