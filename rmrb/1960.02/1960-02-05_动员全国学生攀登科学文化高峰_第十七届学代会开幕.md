Xinhua News Agency, 4th: The 17th Congress of the All-China Students' Federation solemnly opened in Beijing on the morning of the 4th.

The main task of this congress, held under the situation of the continuous Great Leap Forward in the nation's socialist construction, is to mobilize and call on students across the country, under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line, to exert revolutionary energy, further implement the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor," establish lofty communist ideals, scale the heights of science and culture, and advance on the path of becoming both red and expert.

Hu Qili, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, delivered a report to the congress on behalf of the All-China Students' Federation Committee, titled "Both Red and Expert, Scaling the Heights of Science and Culture."

The report reviewed the rapid development of China's socialist revolution and construction since the 16th Congress of the All-China Students' Federation in August 1955, as well as the progress and growth of students across the country. It pointed out that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, are launching a vigorous mass technical revolution and cultural revolution with the momentum and scale of a Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural construction.  Our university students, in the matter of learning and mastering science and culture, should have lofty aspirations and determination to undertake the glorious and important responsibility of tackling the cutting edge and scaling the heights, making arduous efforts in all aspects to cultivate themselves into intellectuals of the working class who are both red and expert. First, it is necessary to establish a communist worldview and thoroughly transform the bourgeois individualistic worldview. Second, it is necessary to persist in participating in productive labor and combining mental and physical labor. Third, it is necessary to study diligently and actively participate in scientific research.

The report concluded by emphasizing that studying Mao Zedong Thought is the most fundamental issue related to cultivating young people into successors to the cause of communism, and it will play a great and decisive role in improving students' political and ideological awareness, establishing a proletarian worldview, and promoting the healthy development of students' lives. Therefore, our students should take studying Mao Zedong Thought as their major political task, be determined to arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and launch a wave of conscientious study of Mao Zedong's works.

The 661 delegates attending the conference are outstanding students and activists in student union work from universities across the country, including members of Han, Zhuang, Mongolian, Tibetan, Hui, Uyghur, Miao, and 16 other ethnic groups. During the conference, they will listen to instructions from responsible comrades of relevant departments of the Central Committee of the Party and other reports, discuss and adopt the new constitution of the All-China Students' Federation, and report to the Party on the tremendous progress made by university students across the country in terms of ideology, study, labor, and physical fitness in recent years.

    动员全国学生攀登科学文化高峰
    第十七届学代会开幕
    据新华社4日讯　中华全国学生第十七届代表大会4日上午在北京隆重开幕。
    在全国社会主义建设连续大跃进形势下召开的这次代表大会，主要任务是：动员和号召全国学生在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，鼓足革命干劲，进一步贯彻执行党的“教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动结合”的方针，树立共产主义大志，攀登科学文化高峰，在又红又专的道路上前进。
    中华全国学生联合会主席胡启立代表全国学联委员会，向大会作了题为“又红又专，攀登科学文化高峰”的报告。
    报告回顾了在1955年8月中华全国学生第十六届代表大会以来，我国社会主义革命和建设事业的飞速发展，以及全国同学的进步和成长后指出，我国人民正在党和毛主席的领导下，以工农业建设大跃进的气势和规模，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的群众性的技术革命和文化革命高潮，我们高等学校的同学，在学习和掌握科学文化的问题上，应该立大志，下决心，把攻尖端、攀高峰这个光荣重大的责任担当起来，从各方面去作艰苦的努力，把自己培养成为又红又专的工人阶级的知识分子。第一，必须树立共产主义的世界观，彻底改造资产阶级个人主义的世界观。第二，必须坚持参加生产劳动，把脑力劳动和体力劳动结合起来。第三，必须认真读书，积极参加科学研究。
    报告最后强调指出：学习毛泽东思想，是关系到培养青年成为共产主义事业接班人的最根本的问题，它对于提高同学的政治思想觉悟，树立无产阶级的世界观，对于同学一生的健全发展都将起着伟大的决定性的作用。因此，我们同学应当把学习毛泽东思想作为自己的重大的政治任务，下决心以毛泽东思想武装自己，掀起一个认真学习毛泽东著作的热潮。
    出席大会的六百六十一名代表都是来自全国各地高等学校的优秀学生和学生会工作的积极分子，其中包括汉、僮、蒙古、藏、回、维吾尔、苗等十六个民族成分。他们在大会期间将听取党中央有关部门的负责同志的指示和其它报告，讨论和通过全国学联新的章程，并且向党汇报全国高等学校学生几年来在思想、读书、劳动和体质方面的巨大进步。
