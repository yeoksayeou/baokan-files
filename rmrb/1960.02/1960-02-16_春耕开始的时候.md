    When Spring Plowing Begins
    Hu Benying
    After the Spring Festival, the frozen fields are filled with choking mist, and remnants of snow haven't yet melted. Early in the morning, the Fifth Mess Hall of the Baima Production Team in the Changchun Commune resounded with lively firecrackers, gongs and drums, the sounds of oxen, and the shouts from loudspeakers, breaking the silence of dawn.
    Sixty-four-year-old Liu Zhisheng, the animal tender, got up even earlier than usual today. He led out the well-fed and robust water buffalo, poured the boiled cotton cakes, corn husks, and rice straw into the feeding trough, added some distillers' grains and salt, and then shouted to the ox: "Ox! This morning, I'm mixing a bucket of good, heat-generating feed for you. When you start plowing and cultivating the fields later, you must run fast and have a 'good start'!" At this moment, Liu Xiaoqiu, the squad leader, walked over carrying the newly modified deep-plowing plow. Hearing what the old man had just said, he jokingly said loudly: "You are a good educator, old man!" Old Man Zhisheng was a little embarrassed, walked over to touch the plow Lao Liu had brought, and changed the subject, saying: "Captain, are the farm tools for this year's spring plowing all prepared?" Lao Liu smiled and said: "They were prepared long ago: plows, harrows, and rollers have all been modified and repaired, and we are going to make rice transplanters too!"
    "Make rice transplanters?" Old Man Zhisheng stretched his neck and asked in surprise.
    "Yes!" Captain Liu said seriously,
    "Yesterday, we already sent carpenters to the commune to learn, and the raw materials have also been prepared. When the people who are learning come back, we can manufacture rice transplanters on a large scale in a few days!"
    "Great!" Old Man Zhisheng smiled from ear to ear, and while speaking, he took out the cattle raincoats, neck yokes, cattle whips, etc., that he had rushed to weave a few nights ago, and handed them all over to the captain.
    Lao Liu drove the ox to level the rice paddies. Old Man Zhisheng returned to his house and happened to run into Comrade Yang Baiqian, the Party Branch Secretary. Old Man Zhisheng asked bluntly: "Secretary, why are you here so early? Isn't your illness still not better!"
    "It's better, it's better," Secretary Yang said with a smile on his face, "Spring plowing is here, and I can't lie down anymore. I came here specifically to prepare for plowing with everyone!"
    "That's great!" The old man said while sizing up the secretary: barefoot in straw sandals, sleeves rolled up high, eyebrows and hair covered in dust. He couldn't help but ask again: "Where did you come from just now?" Secretary Yang said with a smile: "I was tidying up that pile of plant ash in the backyard. That pile of ash is exposed to snow and rain outside, so we have to quickly move it to the ash shed to keep it as fertilizer for covering the rice paddies!"
    "That's right! I'll go help tidy it up too."
    Lao Yang hurriedly stopped the old man and said: "I am leading the women there to tidy up, so we don't need anyone else. If you have time, go and seal the cracks in those two granaries where the seeds are stored. This year, the Fifth Mess Hall will plant early-season Nantao No. 1 rice on all 120-plus mu of land. The Nantao No. 1 seeds in the granary have already been selected, but I just checked and found that there are several wide cracks in the granary, so we have to quickly seal them with mud to prevent rats and sparrows from getting in."
    Old Man Zhisheng thought that what the secretary said made sense, so he carried a rake to the field to dig up mud. He walked out of the door and saw rows of red flags planted in the fields in front of the house, and the shouts of "Heave-ho!" became more and more intense. In the distance, Captain Liu was driving the ox to run fast in the rice paddies. In the surrounding white rice fields, young men wearing white towels were stepping up their efforts to turn the soil and make fertilizer; in the green manure fields, Young Pioneers were also clearing ditches and applying topdressing fertilizer. Nearby, a dozen women wearing colorful clothes were transporting the compost in front of the house to the less fertile fields. The old man walked and thought: This year's spring plowing started early, and the fertilizer accumulated is abundant and good, it must be a bumper year! The more he thought about it, the happier he became. Suddenly, someone behind him shouted: "Make way!" He looked back and saw that it was the woman Yin Xuemei pushing a cart full of fertilizer, the front of the cart almost hitting him. Old Man Zhisheng remembered that Xuemei used to be a daughter-in-law who loved to visit her parents' home during the first month of the lunar year, so he moved to the side and jokingly said: "Xuemei, it's not even the third day of the new year, why aren't you going back to your parents' house to take a break!" Xuemei's face was flushed, and she was breathing heavily, saying seriously: "This spring, we have to transplant rice early, so I don't have the mind to go back to my parents' house. You old man are still stuck in the drum!" As she spoke, she pushed the cart and ran away without looking back.
    Old Man Zhisheng stared at Xuemei's back and said in a muffled voice: "I'm stuck in the drum? Humph! We'll see!" After speaking, he picked up a rake of field mud and strode back to the house to seal the granary.
    The sun came out from the clouds, the morning mist disappeared, and the sounds of water in the fields, the sounds of oxen, laughter, songs, shouts of "Heave-ho!", and the joyful shouts of earth trucks converged into a magnificent wave of sound, as if to tell people: Spring is here!

    春耕开始的时候
    胡本莹
    春节过后，冰冻的田野雾气呛人，残余的雪团还没溶化。一大清早，长春公社白马生产队第五食堂就响起了热闹的鞭炮锣鼓声、?牛声和喇叭筒的叫唤声，冲破了黎明的寂静。
    六十四岁的饲养员刘质生，今天比往常起得更早。他把喂得滚壮的大水牯牵出来，将煮烂了的棉饼、卡子谷和稻草倒进食桶里，又加进些酒糟和食盐，然后对牛喝道：“牛呀！今早拌一桶发热的好料给你吃，等下耕种起田来，要飞跑，来个‘开门红’啊！”这时候，小队长刘晓秋背着新改装的深耕犁走来了。他听见老头子刚才说的话，便大声打趣说：“你老人家好家教啊！”质生爹有点不好意思，走拢去摸摸老刘搬来的犁，换过话头说：“队长，今年春耕的农具都准备好了吗？”老刘笑着说：“早准备好了：犁耙蒲辊都进行了改装和修制，还要制插秧机呢！”
    “制插秧机？”质生爹伸长脖子惊奇地问。
    “嗯！”刘队长认真地说，
    “昨天已经派了木匠到公社学习去了，原材料也已经准备好了，等学习的人回来，过两天就能大量制造插秧机了！”
    “好哇！”质生爹笑得合不拢嘴，边说边把前几天赶夜工编好的牛蓑衣、牛攀颈、牛鞭绳等拿出来，一一交给了队长。
    老刘赶着牛平整秧田去了。质生爹回到屋里，恰好碰到了党支部书记杨柏骞同志。质生爹劈头就问：“支书，怎么来这样早？你的病还没好吧！”
    “好了，好了”，杨支书满脸挂笑地说，“春耕来了，我也躺不住了。我特地到这里来和大家一起备耕哩！”
    “那太好了！”老头子边说边打量支书：赤脚草鞋，衣袖子卷起老高，眉毛头发都沾满了灰尘。他忍不住又问：“你刚才从哪里来呀？”杨支书笑着说：“在屋后背院子里收拾那堆草木灰。那堆灰在外面雪盖雨淋，要赶快移到灰棚子里，留作复盖秧田的肥料哩！”
    “对呀！我也去帮忙收拾一下。”
    老杨忙挡住老头儿说：“我正带领婆婆子们在那里收拾，不要人了。您如果有空，就去把那两间装种谷的仓缝糊一糊。今年五食堂一百二十多亩田全部插早稻南特号。仓里的南特号种已选好了，不过刚才检查了一下，有几处仓缝裂开很宽，要赶快用泥封一封，防止鼠雀钻进去。”
    质生爹听支书说得有理，忙背起耙头到田里去挖泥巴。他走出门外，见屋门口地里插着一路路红旗，嗬呵声一阵紧似一阵。远处，刘队长正赶着牛在秧田里飞跑。他周围的白水田里，围白毛巾的后生子们正加紧翻氹制肥；绿肥田里，红领巾们也在清沟追肥。近处，十几个穿花衣的妇女，正把屋门口的堆肥运到少肥的地里去。老头子边走边想：今年春耕闹得早，肥料积得又多又好，一定是个丰收年啊！他越想越高兴，猛不防背后有人大喝一声：“让路！”回头一看，原来是妇女尹雪梅推着满满的一车肥料跑来了，车头几乎撞到了他的身上。质生爹想起雪梅往年正月是个老爱走娘家的媳妇，就把身子闪到一边，开玩笑地说：“雪梅，还没出正月初三，怎么不回娘屋里歇歇脚呀！”雪梅泛着满面红晕，口里喷着一股热气，一本正经地说：“今春要提早季节插秧，哪有心思回娘家。你老人家还在鼓里头困哩！”她一边说，一边推着车子头也不回地跑了。
    质生爹盯了雪梅的背影一眼，闷声闷气地说：“我在鼓里头困？哼！看吧！”说完，他随手搭了一耙头田泥，大跨步回屋糊仓去了。
    太阳从云端里出来了，晨雾消失了，田里的水响声、?牛声、笑声、歌声、嗬呵声和土车子的欢叫声汇集成一股宏壮的声浪，像是在告诉人们：春天来了！
