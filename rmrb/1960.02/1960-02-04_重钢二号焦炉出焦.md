    Chongqing Iron and Steel's No. 2 Coke Oven Begins Coking
    (Xinhua News Agency) Sichuan Province's first large-scale coke oven—the newly built No. 2 forty-five-hole coke oven at Chongqing Iron and Steel Company—produced its first batch of high-quality coke on the afternoon of January 30.
    The No. 2 coke oven has an annual production capacity of 300,000 tons of metallurgical coke. In the past, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company mostly transported coke from other regions for ironmaking and smelting. Since the Great Leap Forward, due to the rapid growth of steel production, the timely supply of coke has often become a prominent problem. After this coke oven and the No. 1 coke oven, which is under construction, are put into production, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company will be able to achieve self-sufficiency in coke.

    重钢二号焦炉出焦
    据新华社讯　四川省第一座大型焦炉——重庆钢铁公司新建二号四十五孔焦炉，在一月三十日下午炼出了第一炉质量优良的焦炭。
    二号焦炉能年产冶金焦三十万吨，重庆钢铁公司过去炼铁、化铁用的焦炭大都由外地运来。大跃进以来，由于钢铁生产飞速增长，焦炭的及时供应常常成为一个突出的问题。这座焦炉和正在施工的一号焦炉投入生产后，重庆钢铁公司就可以实现焦炭自给。
