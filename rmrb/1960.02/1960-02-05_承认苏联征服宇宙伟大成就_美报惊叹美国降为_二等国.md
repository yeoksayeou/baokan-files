Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch from New York: Many American newspapers have recently published articles commenting on the Soviet Union's astonishing achievements in conquering outer space, and lamenting that the United States has now declined into a "second-rate country in decline." The *New York Journal American* published an article by its publisher, Hearst, on January 31, refuting Eisenhower's claim that the Soviet Union's achievements in conquering the universe would not harm America's international prestige. Hearst wrote: "The Soviet Union's series of new initiatives in the universe have caused enormous damage to our propaganda and have had a serious psychological impact." The author pointed out that the Soviet Union "was the first to launch a satellite, the first to send huge objects into space, and the first to launch a satellite with a camera around the moon."

The *New York Mirror* columnist Pearson, in a Washington dispatch the same day, emphasized that the Soviet Union is now able to launch heavy rockets, while the United States' heavy rockets will not be launched until the end of 1963 at the earliest. The electronic equipment loaded on these large Soviet rockets is more than that of American rockets. He said, "The devices that the Russians are now testing, we cannot even load onto rockets. This puts the Russians ahead in important research, and we will not be able to begin this research until the end of 1963."

Pearson pointed out that, in fact, the Soviet Union's achievements in space photography are even more unsettling to American military experts than the powerful thrust of the accelerators used to launch heavy rockets into space.

He said that our observation instruments observed the Soviet lunar rocket's historic flight, and allowed us to witness this unprecedented achievement firsthand. The large rocket discarded the small maneuvering rockets two days before reaching the moon. After that, Soviet scientists could not change the course of the lunar rocket. However, they calculated it so precisely that it started taking pictures just as the rocket went around the far side of the moon.

Pearson wrote, bewildered, "Somehow, the Soviet Union successfully prevented the rocket from rotating, or successfully installed a dark box that remained stationary in the rotating rocket for the thirty minutes it took to take the pictures.

"After that, the film was automatically developed inside the rocket, but it was not sent back to Moscow until two days later, when scientists precisely calculated that the rocket should fly over the point closest to the Earth. This achievement exceeds everything we could do, and our scientists are stunned. It shows that Russia not only has a good guidance system to reach its targets, but also has excellent automatic control systems and more advanced space photography systems."

The famous American bourgeois commentator Lippmann pointed out in the *New York Herald Tribune* on January 29 that the United States is not only behind in the entire field of rockets and outer space now, but it cannot even maintain its current position. He refuted the US government's boasting that the United States is now "catching up." He pointed out that if this is the case, then it is assumed that the United States is currently moving faster than the Soviet Union. He said, "There is no reason to think that this is correct. It is almost certain that the real situation is that they are moving faster than we are." He used this to advocate that the United States accelerate the development of missiles, and said: "This is the most serious gap (between the Soviet Union and the United States) of all."

### 承认苏联征服宇宙伟大成就  美报惊叹美国降为“二等国”

    承认苏联征服宇宙伟大成就
    美报惊叹美国降为“二等国”
    新华社3日讯　纽约消息：美国许多报纸最近纷纷载文评论苏联在征服宇宙空间方面的惊人成就，并且悲叹美国现在已经下降为“正在衰退的二等国”。“纽约美国人日报”1月31日发表了它的发行人赫斯特的文章，反驳艾森豪威尔所谓苏联在征服宇宙方面的成就不会损害美国的国际威信的说法。赫斯特写道：“苏联在宇宙方面的一系列新创举已使我们的宣传遭到巨大损失，并产生了严重的心理影响。”文章作者指出，苏联“最先发射卫星、最先把巨大的重物送入宇宙，最先把带有照像机的卫星发射到月球周围”。
    “纽约镜报”评论员皮尔逊同一天在一篇华盛顿通讯中着重指出：苏联现在能够发射重型火箭，而美国的重型火箭最早要到1963年底才能发射。苏联的这些大型火箭装载的电子仪器要比美国的火箭装的多。他说，“俄国人现在正在试验的装置，我们甚至不能够装到火箭上去。这就使俄国人在重要的研究方面走在前面，而我们在1963年底以前还不能开始进行这些研究。”
    皮尔逊指出，实际上，苏联在宇宙摄影方面的成就要比把重型火箭发射到宇宙空间用的加速器的强大推力，更加使美国的军事专家感到不安。
    他说，我们的观测仪器观察了苏联月球火箭的具有历史意义的飞行，并使我们亲眼看到了这一空前成就。大火箭在到达月球前两天就抛掉了小的操纵火箭。在这之后，苏联科学家就不能改变月球火箭的航程。然而，他们计算的是如此精确，正好当火箭绕到月球背面时开始拍照。
    皮尔逊茫然不解地写道，“苏联不知如何成功地防止了火箭的旋转，或成功地装设了一个暗箱，在摄影时的三十分钟内，它在旋转的火箭中屹然不动。
    “此后，底片在火箭内部自动显影，但是在两天后才发回莫斯科，这时科学家们精确的计算，火箭应在距地球最近的地方飞过。这一成就超过我们可能作到的一切，我们的科学家都惊异得目瞪口呆。它表明，俄国不仅具有到达目标的良好的导向系统，而且还有出色的自动操纵系统和更加先进的宇宙摄影系统。”
    美国著名资产阶级评论家李普曼1月29日在“纽约先驱论坛报”上指出，美国在整个火箭和宇宙空间方面不仅现在落后了，而且它甚至保不住现在的地位。他驳斥了美国政府关于美国现在正在“赶上去”的吹牛。他指出，如果是这样，那就假定美国目前比苏联走得快。他说，“没有理由认为这一点是对的。几乎肯定，真实情况是他们比我们走得快。”他借此鼓吹美国加速发展导弹，并且说：“这是（苏美之间）一切差距中最严重的差距。”
