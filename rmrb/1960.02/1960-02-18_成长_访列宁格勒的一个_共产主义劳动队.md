    Growth
    —Visiting a "Communist Labor Brigade" in Leningrad
    By our reporters Cui Yongchang and Dai Feng

      Winter in Leningrad is a scene of northern beauty everywhere. At six or seven in the morning, the city is still immersed in midnight-like darkness. Buses and streetcars, with their bright lights on, speed along the icy and snowy roads, each vehicle packed with passengers, all of whom are workers heading to work.

    Outside the "Moscow Gate" in Leningrad, the factory buildings of a large factory gleam with lights. Male and female workers from all directions continuously enter the factory. The "Elektrosila" factory in Leningrad, which has established merits more than once in the history of Soviet industrial development, begins a new day of labor.

    At 7:30 in the morning, it is still dark, but the entrance of the factory has quieted down. Only a few heavy-duty trucks are moving in and out. Upon entering the factory, you will immediately feel an intense and joyful atmosphere of labor. The slogan "Complete the Seven-Year Plan in Five Years" is prominently displayed. An old worker in the factory told us that the entire factory seems to be immersed in the heated competition to strive to become a "Communist Labor Brigade." Currently, more than 130 labor brigades in the factory are striving for this glorious title, and 13 labor brigades have already become "Communist Labor Brigades."

        Ahead of Schedule Again and Again
    Next to the large generator workshop in the "Elektrosila" factory, there is a relatively quiet room. In this room, we found the "Communist Labor Brigade" we needed to visit. Molotkov, the factory newspaper editor, said that if a large generator is compared to a tall building, then what this work team does is bricks and tiles, and these "bricks and tiles" are the commutation plates in the commutator.

    Upon arriving at this work section, we first saw a banner hanging on the wall, which read: "The Mikhail Kurchavenko Communist Labor Brigade Works Here." Below the banner hung the competition guarantee recently proposed by the work team.

    Mikhail Kurchavenko is a tall, strong middle-aged worker. He told us in detail how his work team became a "Communist Labor Brigade."

    Last spring, the upsurge of the "Communist Labor Brigade" competition swept across the Soviet Union. Leningrad's "Elektrosila" factory was no exception. The members of Kurchavenko's work team also proposed to participate in the competition. The work team leader convened a meeting of the work team based on everyone's wishes. At the meeting, everyone unanimously advocated participating in the competition. After discussion, everyone put forward the guarantee: to complete the work team's seven-year plan in six years, strive to save copper for the country, propose at least one rationalization proposal per person per year, everyone must participate in learning, actively participate in social activities, and observe communist morality in life—work, study, and live with the spirit of communism!

    From the day the guarantee was put forward, the situation in the work team gradually changed, although others rarely noticed it at the beginning. Kurchavenko came earlier than usual. He arrived at the work section half an hour before the work bell rang to check whether the machines had any faults, whether the raw materials were sufficient, and to think about how to allocate today's tasks. The team members also came early, and some started working before the work bell rang. But even when working, Kurchavenko was thinking about how to improve the work team's labor efficiency. Because if the seven-year plan is to be completed one year ahead of schedule, production innovation is impossible. Adjacent to Kurchavenko was Aleksandrov, who specialized in drilling holes in commutator copper plates. The drilling machine could only drill one copper plate at a time and had to be squeezed by hand, which was very inefficient. Kurchavenko wanted to try installing a pneumatic squeezer on the machine. He told the workshop technician Marchenko about this idea and received Marchenko's support. Later, the experiment was successful, and the drilling efficiency was immediately increased fourfold. Now, holes can be drilled in five copper plates at a time.

    After the realization of this rationalization proposal, it opened up a path for the work team's technical innovation movement. As a result, rationalization proposals were put forward one after another. A trend has gradually formed in the work team, that is, to improve any kind of work as much as possible, regardless of size. In this way, accumulating one item after another, the work team's quota completion rate increased day by day, rising from the initial 130% to 250% in just two months.

    On the basis of vigorously promoting rationalization proposals, everyone not only strengthened their confidence in completing the seven-year plan in six years, but also put forward the slogan "Complete the Seven-Year Plan in Five Years" on the eve of the opening of the Sixth Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee last year. Captain Kurchavenko said, "We made this proposal at that time based on the fact that it used to take about fifty-seven working hours to make one thousand eight hundred commutator copper plates, but now it only takes twenty-four working hours. If we further improve production, then the work team's seven-year plan is entirely possible to be completed in five years."

          Friendly Help
    If you stay in Kurchavenko's work team for a day, then you will find how different the eight people in this work team are in terms of experience and personality, but how consistent their wishes and efforts are in work. The oldest in the work team is Kurchavenko, who is thirty-five years old, and the youngest is Rudashevsky, who recently turned eighteen. During the Soviet Patriotic War, Kurchavenko fought as a guerrilla in the Leningrad region and was a very good machine gunner. Rudashevsky, on the other hand, was born in 1942 and just graduated from tenth grade last year. Under the educational policy of combining education with productive labor, he decided to come to the factory to work. But today, the desire to strive to become a "Communist Labor Brigade" unites them.

    The three young people in the work team—Rudashevsky, Smirnov, and Ryzhkov—had some difficulties when they first came to the factory. Although they had labor lessons in school and had interned in the factory, factory life was different from student life after all. But as Smirnov said, after they came to the work team, they immediately felt a sense of friendly help. Captain Kurchavenko spent a lot of time on the first day introducing them to the nature of the work in detail, and asked them to start with the simplest work, gradually become familiar with all the work, and strive to become all-rounders. Ryzhkov initially worked on cutting copper plates. At the beginning, the cuts were always uneven, and he was a little anxious. At this time, Kurchavenko said to him: "Any work can only be improved after you are familiar with it. It doesn't matter if there are difficulties in the work. The important thing is not to rush. Your difficulties are my difficulties. I will help you every day until you learn." With such patient help, Ryzhkov went from an apprentice to a third-grade worker.

    In Kurchavenko's work team, anyone can feel that this work team is willing to help others enthusiastically. When we came here for an interview, we saw only seven people working in the work section. Captain Kurchavenko told us that someone from the work team had been sent to other places to support fraternal units. He also said: "We must do our own tasks well. There is no problem with this. But this is not enough. We must do everything possible to ensure that everyone's work is completed well."

        Pick Up the Book
    A distinct characteristic of the "Communist Labor Brigade" competition movement is that it requires participants in the movement not only to treat work with the spirit of communism, but also to treat learning and life with the spirit of communism. Learning and doing everything possible to improve one's ideological, cultural, and technical level is one of the competition conditions for striving to become a "Communist Labor Brigade." Kurchavenko said: "Everyone in our work team is learning. Although the methods of learning are different, it has become a habit in our work team to put down tools and pick up books after work."

    There are many forms of learning in Kurchavenko's work team. In terms of political study, there are CPSU Party History study groups and current affairs reports; in terms of cultural learning, some people participate in night universities, and some attend youth worker schools; in terms of technical study, there are also technical improvement study groups.

    Every Thursday, after work, regular Party history studies begin in the workshop's "red corner." Kurchavenko is a participant in this study group. When we asked him about his learning experience, he said that he is currently studying the chapter on the Patriotic War period in the history of the CPSU Party. Because he himself participated in this war, his understanding is particularly profound. He said that studying the history of the Party has increased his confidence in his work.

    Young worker Ryzhkov's study plan is even more specific. He is determined to obtain a secondary education level within three years. Now he is attending the youth worker school and is studying the seventh-grade curriculum. And Rudashevsky, who already has a secondary education level, has set a more ambitious study plan. He wants to obtain a university level within five or six years. Currently, he is preparing to take the entrance examination for the Electrical Engineering Institute and studies mathematics and physics whenever he has time. Kurchavenko also told us that in order to universally improve everyone's technical level, the workshop engineer has agreed to give everyone a technical lesson every week to teach everyone the principles of mechanical structure.

    In addition to studying, this work team can also find enough time to participate in social work. For example, the young and strong Ryzhkov also participates in the work of the people's militia once a week after get off work; Kurakov is the workshop Communist Youth League group leader; and Kurchavenko serves as the workshop trade union committee member.

          Double Happiness
    In the second half of last year, two happy events occurred in Kurchavenko's work team.

    In early November, this work team completed the 1959 production plan almost two months ahead of schedule. After the workshop trade union organization summarized their achievements, it decided to award them the honorary title of "Communist Labor Brigade." The achievements summarized at that time were: completing the production plan two months ahead of schedule; all team members proposed a total of thirty rationalization proposals, saving the country more than 45,000 rubles; saving 5,000 kilograms of copper, and using it to create commutators for six large generators; each team member actively studied and enthusiastically participated in social activities; and observed communist morality in life, playing a exemplary role.

    Antonov, the secretary of the workshop Party committee, said that since this work team proposed to strive to become a "Communist Labor Brigade," the competition process seemed to have summoned the enthusiasm in the hearts of every worker. It is because of this determination to strive for the early arrival of communism that they have achieved this series of achievements. Kurchavenko said when talking about the situation when they received this honorary title: When a banner of "Communist Labor Brigade" was hung on the wall of their work section, everyone felt a kind of joy from the bottom of their hearts, but at the same time they felt that their tasks were even more important, because in order to be worthy of this glorious title, they had to demand more strictly of themselves and work better.

    The second happy event in the work team was that Kurchavenko was accepted into the ranks of the Party.

    Even during the competition, Kurchavenko felt keenly the Party organization's concern for the work team. Every rationalization proposal they put forward received the support and help of the workshop Party organization. For example, Marchenko, the workshop technician and Communist Party member, gave the work team patient help. Kurchavenko discussed the issue of improving production with Party comrades in the workshop Party committee office countless times. A person from a worker's family, who joined the guerrillas at the age of fifteen, has a very deep feeling for the Party organization. Kurchavenko said that he personally saw Cen Chenko, the pre-war district Party committee secretary and wartime guerrilla captain, being heroic and tenacious under difficult conditions in the guerrilla team, and from that time on he was determined to be such a person.

    October 28, 1959, is a day that Kurchavenko will never forget in his life. On this day, he walked into the gate of the district Party committee. Cherniavsky, the first secretary of the district Party committee, personally informed him that he had become a probationary member of the CPSU and encouraged him to work and study better and strive to become a good Communist Party member.

    From that day on, Kurchavenko seemed to have gained a new strength in his life. He was not only more responsible in his work, but also worked with the team members to find ways to complete the seven-year plan earlier.

    成长
    ——访列宁格勒的一个“共产主义劳动队”
    本报记者　崔永昌　戴枫
      冬天的列宁格勒，到处是
  一片北国景色。早晨六、七点
  钟，城市还浸沉在午夜般的漆黑中，公共汽车和电车开着明亮的灯在冰雪的道路上奔驰，每辆车中都满载着乘客，他们全是去上班的职工。
    在列宁格勒的“莫斯科门”外，一个大工厂的座座厂房闪耀着灯光，来自四面八方的男女工人陆续地走进了工厂。在苏联工业发展史上不只一次建立了功勋的列宁格勒“电力”工厂，又开始了新的劳动的一天。
    早晨七点半钟，天还没亮，但是工厂门边已经静了下来，只有一辆辆载重汽车在出出进进。走进工厂以后，你首先就会感到一种紧张而愉快的劳动气氛。“七年计划五年完成”的口号触目皆是。工厂中的一位老工人告诉我们说，现在整个工厂好像都浸沉在争取作“共产主义劳动队”的热火朝天的竞赛中。目前全厂已经有一百三十多个劳动队在争取这个光荣的称号。而有十三个劳动队则已经成了“共产主义劳动队”了。
        提前再提前
    在“电力”工厂的大型发电机车间旁边，有个比较清静的房子，就在这个房间里，我们找到了需要访问的“共产主义劳动队”。工厂厂报编辑莫洛特科夫说，如果把大型发电机比作高楼，那么这个工作队做的则是砖瓦，而这个“砖瓦”则是变向器中变向铜板。
    来到这个工段以后，我们首先看到了挂在墙上的一面锦旗，上面写着：“在这里工作的是米·库尔恰文共产主义劳动队”。锦旗下面挂着工作队最近提出的竞赛保证。
    米哈依尔·库尔恰文是一个身材很高的壮年工人，他向我们详细地谈起了自己的工作队成为“共产主义劳动队”的经过。
    去年春天，“共产主义劳动队”竞赛的热潮席卷了苏联全国，列宁格勒的“电力”工厂也不例外，库尔恰文工作队的成员也提出了要参加竞赛，工作队队长根据大家的愿望召开了工作队的会议，在会上大家一致主张参加竞赛。大家商量的结果，提出了保证：把工作队的七年工作计划六年完成，努力为国家节省铜材，每人每年至少提一件合理化建议，每人全要参加学习，积极参加社会活动，在生活中遵守共产主义道德——用共产主义的精神来工作、学习和生活！
    从提出保证这一天开始，工作队中的情况就逐渐发生了变化，虽然在开始的时候别人还很少注意到。库尔恰文比平常来得更早了，他在上班铃响前半小时就来到了工段，检查机器有没有故障，原料是不是够用，再想一下今天的任务如何分配。队员们也纷纷早来，有人等不及上班铃响就工作起来。但是就在工作的时候，库尔恰文想的也是如何提高工作队的劳动效率问题。因为要想使七年计划提前一年完成，没有生产的革新是不可能的。同库尔恰文相邻工作的是亚历山大洛夫，他专门在变向器铜板上钻孔，钻孔机每次只能钻一个铜板，并且要用手压榨，效率很低。库尔恰文就想试验在机器上安装气力压榨器，他把这个想法告诉了车间技师马尔琴柯，得到了马尔琴柯的支持。后来试验成功，马上把钻孔的工作效率提高了四倍，现在一次就可以在五个铜板上钻孔了。
    这个合理化建议实现后，为工作队的技术革新运动打开了途径，结果合理化建议一条跟着一条地提了出来。在工作队中已经逐渐形成了一种风气，就是对任何一种工作，不管大小，能改进的尽量改进。这样，一件一件地积累，工作队定额的完成率一天天上升，仅仅两个月，就由最初的130％上升到了250％。
    在大提合理化建议的基础上，大家不但加强了七年计划六年完成的信心，并且在去年苏共中央六月全会开幕前夕，工作队又提出了“七年计划五年完成”的口号。队长库尔恰文说，
  “我们当时这样提出是有根据的，因为以前作一千八百个变向器铜板大概要五十七个工作小时，而现在只要用二十四个工作小时就够了。如果我们再进一步改进生产，那么工作队的七年计划完全有可能在五年内完成。”
          友谊的帮助
    如果你在库尔恰文的工作队呆上一天，那么你就会发现，这个工作队中的八个人在经历上和性格上是多么不同，但是在工作中的愿望和努力又是多么一致。工作队中岁数最大的是库尔恰文，他三十五岁，而年纪最轻是鲁达谢夫斯基，他不久前刚满十八岁。库尔恰文在苏联卫国战争时期，曾经在列宁格勒州打过游击，是一个很好的机关枪手。而鲁达谢夫斯基1942年才诞生，去年才从十年级中学毕业，在教育与生产劳动相结合的教育方针下，决心来工厂工作。但是今天争取作“共产主义劳动队”的愿望把他们联结在一起。
    工作队中的三个年青人——鲁达谢夫斯基、斯米尔诺夫、雷日柯夫刚来到工厂时是有些困难的，尽管在学校时上过劳动课，并且在工厂里实习过，但是工厂的生活与学生生活到底不同。可是正如斯米尔诺夫所说的，他们来到工作队以后，马上就感到一种友谊的帮助，库尔恰文队长第一天用了很多时间详细地向他们介绍了工作性质，并且要他们从最简单的工作开始，逐渐熟悉所有的工作，争取成为全面手，雷日柯夫起初作切铜板的工作，一开始时切的总是不够整齐，自己也有些着急，这时库尔恰文对他说：“任何工作总是熟悉了以后才能提高，工作中有困难没关系，重要的是不要着急，你的困难就是我的困难，你一天不学会我就帮助你一天。”在这样耐心的帮助下，雷日柯夫由学徒成了三级工。
    在库尔恰文工作队里，任何人都可以感到，这个工作队是肯热心帮助别人的。我们到这里采访时，看到工段上只有七个人在工作，库尔恰文队长告诉我们说，工作队里有人被派到其他地方去支援兄弟单位了，他还说：“我们工作队自己的任务一定要好好完成，这没问题。但是这还不够，我们要尽一切力量使大家的工作都完成得好。”
        拿起书本来
    “共产主义劳动队”竞赛运动的一个鲜明特点，就是它要求运动的参加者不但要用共产主义的精神对待工作，并且要用共产主义的精神来对待学习和生活。学习，千方百计地提高自己的思想水平、文化水平、技术水平，是争取作“共产主义劳动队”的竞赛条件之一。库尔恰文说：“我们工作队每个人都在学习，学习的方式虽有不同，但是工作结束后，放下工具就拿起书本，这在我们工作队已经成习惯了。”
    在库尔恰文工作队中学习的形式是很多的。在政治学习方面有苏共党史学习小组，有时事报告；在文化学习方面，有人参加夜大学，有人上青年工人学校；在技术学习方面，还有提高技术学习小组。
    每逢星期四，工作结束后，车间的“红角”里开始了定期的党史学习。库尔恰文是这个学习小组的参加者，当我们问他的学习心得时，他说，目前正在学习苏共党史中的卫国战争时期这一章，他自己因为曾参加过这一战争，所以学习起来体会也就特别深刻。他说，通过党史学习，使他增加了工作的信心。
    青年工人雷日柯夫的学习计划订得更加具体，他决心要在三年内取得中等文化水平，现在他参加了青年工人学校，正在学习七年级的课程。而已经有了中等文化水平的鲁达谢夫斯基订的学习计划更加远大，他要在五、六年内取得大学水平，目前他正在准备考电机工程学院，每天一有功夫就学习数学和物理。库尔恰文还告诉我们说，为了普遍提高大家的技术水平，车间工程师已经答应每星期给大家上一次技术课，教大家学习机械构造原理。
    这个工作队除去学习外，还能找到足够的时间参加社会工作。例如年青力壮的雷日柯夫，每星期一次在下班以后，还要参加人民纠察队工作；库拉柯夫是车间共青团小组长；而库尔恰文则担任着车间工会委员的工作。
          双喜临门
    去年下半年，库尔恰文工作队里发生了两件喜事。
    11月初，这个工作队差不多提前两个月完成了1959年生产计划，车间工会组织总结了他们的成绩以后，决定授予他们以“共产主义劳动队”的光荣称号。当时总结的成绩是：提前两月完成了生产计划；全体队员一共提出了三十条合理化建议，为国家节省资金四万五千多卢布；节约铜材五千公斤，并用它造成了六部大型发电机的变向器；每个队员都积极学习，踊跃参加社会活动；在生活方面遵守共产主义道德，起了模范作用。
    车间党委书记安东诺夫说，这个工作队自从提出争取作“共产主义劳动队”以后，竞赛的进程好像把每个工人心中的热力都召唤了出来，正因为有这种争取共产主义早日到来的决心，所以他们才得到了这一系列的成绩。库尔恰文在谈到他们得到这一光荣称号时的情况说：当一面“共产主义劳动队”的锦旗挂在他们工段的墙上时，大家全感到了一种出自内心的喜悦，但是同时也感到自己的任务更加重大了，因为要不愧于这个光荣的称号，就要更加严格地要求自己，更好地工作。
    工作队中的第二件喜事是库尔恰文被接受参加了党的队伍。
    还在竞赛期间，库尔恰文就亲切地感到了党组织对于工作队的关心。他们提的每一件合理化建议都得到了车间党组织的支持和帮助，例如车间技术员、共产党员马尔琴柯就给了工作队以耐心的帮助。不知多少次库尔恰文在车间党委办公室里与党员同志一起商量改进生产的问题。一个工人家庭出身的、从十五岁就参加了游击队的人对于党组织的感情是非常深刻的。库尔恰文说，他在游击队里就亲眼看到了战前的区党委书记、战时的游击队长岑琴柯在困难条件下的英勇顽强，从那时起他就决心要作一个这样的人。
    1959年10月28日，在库尔恰文生活中是永远不能忘记的一天。这一天，他走进了区党委会的大门，区党委第一书记车尔尼亚夫斯基亲自通知他，他已经成了苏共的预备党员，并勉励他更好地工作和学习，争取成为一个好的共产党员。
    从那一天起，库尔恰文在生活中就好像得到了一种新的力量，他不但在工作中更加负责，并且与队员们一起想办法如何更早地完成七年计划。
