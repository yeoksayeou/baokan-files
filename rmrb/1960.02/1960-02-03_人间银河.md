    "Sunlight on the Xianglu Peak creates a purple haze, From afar, the waterfall hangs before the river. Its torrent plunges down three thousand feet, As if the Silver River falls from the ninth heaven." This is Li Bai's poem describing the Lushan Waterfall. In people's eyes, waterfalls are an extremely magnificent natural scenery. Their rushing and surging momentum makes the motherland's landscape appear more majestic and vivid. In our country, there are many waterfalls. Not only Lushan, Yandang Mountain, Huangshan Mountain, Mogan Mountain... many famous mountains have waterfalls, and many rivers also have waterfalls. The Huangguoshu Waterfall in Guizhou is the most famous among them.

    Why do waterfalls appear? That's because the terrain suddenly drops sharply, with a large difference in height. When water flows through here, it suddenly falls, forming a waterfall. But why does the terrain have such changes and also have flowing water passing by?

    It turns out that the undulation of the terrain is often caused by the flowing water; on a river, the rocks at the bottom of the river are different in various places, some are soft and some are hard. The soft ones are easily destroyed, and the terrain becomes lower, while the hard ones become higher. At the junction of soft and hard rocks, the difference in height is particularly large, and waterfalls appear. Where tributaries of rivers flow into the mainstream, sometimes because the river water in the mainstream has great destructive power and scours the riverbed very deep, while the tributaries are shallower, waterfalls can also form here. If it is not flowing water but glaciers, it can also carve out valleys of varying depths, providing conditions for the formation of waterfalls. This situation mainly occurs in high mountains.

    Sometimes, it is not due to the work of flowing water but due to external factors that cause changes in the terrain. For example, a fault occurs at the bottom of the river, and the earth's crust subsides on one side of the fault and rises on the other side. At this time, of course, a waterfall will form. When the river is blocked by lava erupted from volcanoes, sand and rocks collapsed during landslides, and deposits transported by glaciers, lakes are formed. Because the water in the lake is very high, waterfalls often form when flowing from the lake into the river channel. When lakes on high mountains transport water down the mountains, they naturally plummet. The Tianchi outlet on the top of Changbai Mountain has a waterfall of more than sixty meters high. Groundwater flowing from mountain caves can also fall very sharply.

    There are many other reasons for the formation of waterfalls. The appearance of waterfalls clearly shows that changes are constantly taking place in the earth's crust.

    The appearance of waterfalls is not always constant. Where the water falls, the water power is the strongest, and the destruction of the earth's crust is particularly drastic. The steep cliff at the fall of the waterfall continues to collapse, retreating in the opposite direction of the water flow. Finally, the high part of the riverbed does not appear prominent, and the waterfall disappears. As early as more than one hundred and ten years ago, geologist Lyell discovered that the famous Niagara Falls has retreated 11.2 kilometers in the last 35,000 years.

    The power possessed by a waterfall is related to its water volume and drop, and the so-called drop is its height. The greater the water volume and drop, the greater the power of the waterfall.

    Facing such a magnificent waterfall, poets and painters often want to compose poems and paintings for it, but in the old society, due to the limitations of the times, even with Li Bai's boldness, he could only exclaim "How magnificent is the work of creation!" in the face of this masterpiece of nature, and even came up with the idea of "forever resigning from the human world."

    In the eyes of people in the Mao Zedong era, waterfalls are no longer just scenery for viewing. More importantly, they are huge power that can be tamed. Large waterfalls can generate electricity, and small waterfalls can also drive machines to grind rice and flour... saving a lot of labor. Since waterfalls are so useful, it is not enough to just use natural, ready-made waterfalls. We have built and are still building many dams. Each dam can raise the water level of the river, forming artificial waterfalls of varying sizes to serve us. In the future, huge artificial waterfalls will make the world's famous waterfalls pale in comparison. Our glorious and heroic labor is writing a poem that has never been seen in history.

    人间银河

    “日照香炉生紫烟，遥看瀑布挂前川。飞流直下三千尺，疑是银河落九天。”这是李白描写庐山瀑布的诗。瀑布在人们的眼里，是一种极为壮丽的自然景色，它那奔腾澎湃的气势，使祖国的山水显得更加雄伟和生动。在我国，瀑布是特别多的，不仅是庐山、雁荡山、黄山、莫干山……许多名山中都有瀑布，很多河流上也有瀑布，贵州黄果树瀑布就是其中最著名的。
    为什么会出现瀑布呢？那是因为地势陡然下降，高低相差很大，水从这里流过时便突然跌落，形成瀑布。可是地势为什么会有这样的变化同时正好还有流水经过呢？
    原来很多时候地势的起伏正是流水造成的；在一条河流上，河底的岩石在各处是不一样的，有的软有的硬，软的易被破坏，地势变低了，硬的则变得高了，在软硬岩石交界的地方，地势高低相差特别大，出现了瀑布。在河流的支流注入主流的地方，有时因为主流中的河水破坏力很大，将河床刷得很深，支流则浅些，于是在此也能形成瀑布。如果不是流水而是冰川，也能刨刮出深浅不一的山谷，提供形成瀑布的条件，这种情况主要出现在高山中。
    有时，不是由于流水的工作而是由于外来的因素使地形发生了变化，譬如在河底发生了断裂，而且在断裂的一边地壳下沉，另一边上升了，这时当然要形成瀑布。当河流被火山喷出的熔岩，山崩时塌下的沙石以及冰川搬来的堆积物堵塞时，造成了湖泊，而因为湖中的水壅得很高，在从湖里流入河道时也往往形成瀑布，高山上的湖泊往山下输水时，自然更是一落千丈，长白山顶的天池出口就有一个约六十余米高的瀑布。从山中洞穴里流出的地下水也可以跌落得很厉害。
    形成瀑布的原因还很多，瀑布的出现清楚地表明了地壳上在不断发生变动。
    瀑布出现后并不是永远不变的，在水流下跌的地方，水力最为强大，对地壳的破坏特别剧烈，瀑布跌落处的陡崖不断崩塌，向着和水流相反的方向后退，终于河底高出的部分显得不突出了，瀑布消失了。早在一百一十多年以前，地质学家莱伊尔就发现著名的尼亚加拉大瀑布在最近三万五千年以来已后退了十一点二公里。
    瀑布所拥有的力量与它的水量和落差有关，所谓落差也就是它的高度，水量、落差愈大，瀑布的力量也愈大。
    面对着这样壮丽的瀑布，诗人画家常常要为它吟诗作画，但在旧社会里，由于时代的局限性，纵如李白的豪放，在这大自然的杰作面前也只能发出“壮哉造化功”的感叹，乃至产生了“永愿辞人间”的念头。
    在毛泽东时代的人们的眼里，瀑布已不再仅仅是供观赏的景色，更重要的它是可以驯服的巨大的动力，大的瀑布可以发电，小的瀑布也可以推动机器碾米磨面……节省大量的劳动力。瀑布既然是这样有用，因此单单是利用天然的现成的瀑布还不够，我们已经修了并且还正在修筑许多拦河坝，每一座坝都能壅高河流的水位，形成或大或小的人工瀑布来为我们服务。在未来，巨大的人工瀑布将使世界上著名的瀑布也感到逊色。我们光荣豪迈的劳动正写着历史上所从来没有过的诗篇。
