Xinhua News Agency, February 26th: Chinese steel rolling workers have recently achieved a significant innovation in steel production: using small rolling mills (i.e., rough rolling mills with a roll diameter of 500 mm and finishing rolling mills with a roll diameter of 300 mm) to produce steel with larger cross-sections. In Shanghai, Tangshan, Qingdao, Xinjiang, Hefei, Hubei, Zhejiang, and other places, seven steel plants have already used these small rolling mills to produce medium-sized steel rails weighing 18 kg and 24 kg per meter. Among them, Tangshan Steel Plant, Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, Qingdao No. 3 Steel Plant, and two other plants have begun to mass-produce these medium-sized steel rails.

The innovation of steel rolling workers in producing large steel on small rolling mills is a result of responding to the Party's call to break down superstition, liberate thinking, and be bold in thinking and acting. In the past, steel rails weighing 18 kg or more per meter were produced on larger rolling mills. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry attaches great importance to the innovative initiative of using small rolling mills to roll large steel and has held two meetings to promote this significant experience on small rolling mills nationwide. Nineteen steel plants in various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have recently signed a contract to launch a production competition, deciding to mass-produce medium-sized steel rails on small rolling mills and further expand the variety to produce I-beams, angle steel, channel steel, and other shaped steel.

According to the experience of steel plants in Shanghai, Tangshan, Qingdao, and other places, rolling large steel on small rolling mills requires reforming the groove design of the rolls on the rolling mill and adding finishing equipment such as straightening, sawing, and punching equipment. Currently, steel plants in various regions are taking measures to solve these problems. In terms of accelerating the training of personnel in groove design for rolling mills, many steel rolling enterprises are relying on the support and assistance of old enterprises in Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongqing, and other places, while also preparing to send people to training classes run by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry for training. Steel plants in Tangshan, Tianjin, Anyang, Guangzhou, and other places are taking various measures to add some steel finishing equipment and other equipment through self-reliance; some steel rolling plants are preparing to use small punching machines to replace punching machines for the time being.

To meet the needs of the continued leap forward in the national economy, this year's steel production in China not only requires high-speed development in quantity but also requires a large increase in variety. Taking medium-sized and light steel rails as examples, due to the rapid development of transportation, this year's demand is expected to increase by about two times compared to last year's output; the large-scale manufacturing of various vehicles in various regions has also greatly increased the need for various types of steel. At present, China does not have many large rolling mills producing various large steels. Therefore, using small rolling mills to mass-produce medium-sized steel rails and large-section shaped steel to share part of the production task for large rolling mills is an important way to increase the urgently needed steel varieties this year. In addition, these small rolling mills' ability to roll large steel has great significance for solving the needs of industrial and agricultural production in these areas locally. In the past, many provinces and regions needed to transport large steel such as steel rails from Anshan, Chongqing, Taiyuan, and other places.

### 我国轧钢工人的一项重大革新创举  小轧机轧出大型钢材

    我国轧钢工人的一项重大革新创举
    小轧机轧出大型钢材
    据新华社26日讯　我国轧钢工人最近在钢材生产上成功地实现了一项重大的革新创举：在五百毫米—三百毫米的小型轧钢机（即粗轧机的轧辊直径为五百毫米，精轧机的轧辊直径为三百毫米）上，轧出了断面较大的钢材。上海、唐山、青岛、新疆、合肥、湖北、浙江等地，已经有七个钢铁厂用这种小型轧钢机，轧出了每米重十八公斤和二十四公斤的中型钢轨。其中，唐山钢厂、上海第三钢厂、青岛第三钢铁厂等五个厂，已经开始成批地生产这种中型钢轨。
    轧钢工人们在小轧机上轧出大型钢材的创举，是响应党的破除迷信、解放思想、敢想敢干的号召所取得的。过去，每米重十八公斤以上的钢轨，都是在较大的轧钢机上生产的。冶金工业部非常重视小型轧机轧制大钢材的革新创举，召开了两次会议，在全国小型轧机上推广这一重大经验。各省、市、自治区有十九个钢铁厂，最近签订了一项开展生产竞赛的合同，决定在小型轧机上大量生产中型钢轨，并且进一步扩大品种，用小型轧机生产工字钢、角钢、槽钢等型钢材。
    据上海、唐山、青岛等地钢铁厂的经验，在小型轧机上轧制大型钢材，必须改革轧钢机上轧辊的孔型设计；增添产品的精整设备，如矫直、锯断、冲孔设备等。目前，各地钢铁厂都在纷纷采取措施，解决这些问题。在加速培养轧钢机的孔型设计人材方面，许多轧钢企业一方面依靠上海、武汉、重庆等地老企业的支援帮助，一方面准备派人到冶金工业部开办的训练班进行培训。唐山、天津、安阳、广州等地一些钢铁厂，正在采取各种办法，自力更生地添置一些钢材精整设备等；有的轧钢厂准备先用小冲床代替冲孔机。
    适应国民经济继续跃进的需要，今年我国钢材生产，不仅要求在数量上高速度地发展，而且也要求大量增加品种。以中型钢轨和轻型钢轨为例，由于交通运输事业的迅速发展，今年的需要量预计将比去年的产量增加两倍左右；各地大造各种车辆，对各种型钢的需要也大大增加。目前我国生产各种大型钢材的大型轧钢机还不多，因此，用小型轧钢机大量生产中型钢轨和大断面的型钢，为大型轧钢机分担一部分生产任务，是今年增产急需的钢材品种的一条重要途径。此外，这些小型轧钢机能轧制大型钢材，对于就地解决这些地区工农业生产的需要，也有很大的意义。而在过去，许多省、区所需要的钢轨等大型钢材，都是从鞍山、重庆、太原等地运去的。
