Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd Dispatch: The Vice-Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Michio Iwamura, published an article in "Akahata," condemning the Kishi Nobusuke group for spreading lies about improving Japan-China relations after revising the "Security Treaty."

In his article entitled "Revising the Security Treaty and Japan-China Relations," the author said that many people have pointed out that the U.S. military bases in Japan are aimed at China and the Soviet Union. They believe that the Kishi Nobusuke group's revision of the "Security Treaty" and agreement with the United States on "joint defense" means further hostility towards China and the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is only natural that the Soviet and Chinese governments have issued serious warnings to Japan. The article then exposed the deceptive claim by some in the Liberal Democratic Party that the deadlock in Japan-China relations could be broken even after the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" was revised. The article said that their strengthening of the military system that provokes China and the Soviet Union on the one hand, while believing that Japan-China relations can be normalized on the other, demonstrates their traditional militaristic views. The article revealed that the Kishi Nobusuke group has no intention of respecting neighboring China's position and coexisting with China at all.

The article pointed out that the Chinese government opposes Japan's policy of hostility towards China and has always stood on the position of peaceful coexistence with Japan in order to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism.

Referring to Japan's military build-up, the article pointed out that China has not said anything about Japan's independent self-defense forces, but China, which is rapidly carrying out peaceful construction, cannot tolerate the United States using Japan's bases and troops as a military system to attack China and the Soviet Union.

The article said that China's international status is rising day by day, and it is constantly developing friendly cooperation with Asian and African countries.

The article said that those who hope to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations should be called upon to recognize that revising the "Security Treaty" is contrary to breaking the deadlock in Japan-China relations. Hostility towards China is hostility towards Asia, and it means isolating oneself in Asia. The article concluded by saying that the Japanese people's struggle against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" will achieve final victory.

    签订日美军事条约就是向中苏挑衅
    日本敌视中国将使自己孤立
    日中友协领导人揭穿岸信介的欺骗宣传
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：日中友好协会副理事长岩村三千夫在“赤旗报”上发表文章，谴责岸信介集团散布所谓在修改“安全条约”后改善日中关系的谎言。
    作者在这篇题为“修改安全条约和日中关系”的文章中说，已经有很多人指出，在日本的美军基地是针对中国和苏联的。他们认为岸信介集团修改“安全条约”并且同美国约定要“共同防御”，这意味着进一步敌视中国和苏联。因此，苏联和中国政府向日本提出严重警告，这是理所当然的。文章接着揭露了自由民主党中一些人所说即使修改了日美“安全条约”也能打开日中关系僵局的欺骗说法。文章说，他们所以一方面加强向中苏挑衅的军事体系而另一方面又认为可以使日中关系正常化，这表明了他们的传统的军国主义观点。文章揭穿岸信介集团根本没有尊重邻邦中国的立场并同中国共存的想法。
    文章指出，中国政府反对日本方面敌视中国的政策，始终是站在同日本和平共处的立场，为了防止日本军国主义复活。
    谈到日本的军备问题时，文章指出，对于独立的日本的自卫力量，中国并没有说什么，但是，正在迅速进行和平建设的中国无论如何不能容忍美国利用日本的基地和军队，来作为攻击中苏的军事体系。
    文章说，中国的国际地位正在日益提高，并且不断地同亚洲和非洲各国发展友好合作。
    文章说，应该向希望打开日中关系僵局的人们呼吁，修改“安全条约”是同打开日中关系僵局背道而驰的，敌视中国就是敌视亚洲，就是使自己在亚洲孤立。文章最后表示，日本人民反对新的日美“安全条约”的斗争将获得最后胜利。
