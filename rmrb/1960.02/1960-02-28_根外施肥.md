    Foliar Fertilization
    Foliar fertilization of tea trees is a good method that saves labor, fertilizer, and produces quick results. The Anshun City Tea Station in Guizhou Province conducted multiple experiments at the Lianshipu Tea Production Experimental Farm of the Jichang Commune, which proved that tea trees that underwent foliar fertilization generally increased tea production by 60%-104% compared to tea trees that did not. Fertilizers used for foliar fertilization include chemical fertilizers and *Artemisia* branch (bitter *Artemisia*, stinky *Artemisia*) water, etc. According to experiments, *Artemisia* branch water is very effective. The preparation method of *Artemisia* branch water is to first chop one hundred catties of fresh *Artemisia* branches with a knife or crush them with stones, add two hundred catties of water and soak them for one day and one night to obtain the *Artemisia* branch solution. When using, take thirty to forty catties of the solution, add another one hundred catties of water to dilute it, and spray it on the back of the old leaves of the tea trees with a sprayer. Tea can be picked four to six days after spraying the fertilizer.
    Tea trees show results four or five days after being sprayed, mainly manifested as: rapid germination of leaf buds, strong growth, new shoots grow to one bud and five or six leaves, and will not become dormant buds. In addition, *Artemisia* branch water also has insecticidal effects.

    根外施肥
    茶树根外施肥是一种省工、省肥、见效快的好方法。贵州省安顺市茶叶站在鸡场公社连石铺茶叶生产试验场做了多次试验，证明在同一块茶园里，经过根外施肥的茶树，与不根外施肥的茶树比较，茶叶产量一般可增产60％—104％。根外施肥用的肥料有化肥、蒿枝（苦蒿、臭蒿）水等。据试验，蒿枝水效果很好。蒿枝水的配制方法是先将生蒿枝一百斤，用刀铡碎或用石头捶烂，加水二百斤沤置一天一夜后，即成蒿枝溶液。用时取溶液三十一四十斤，再加水一百斤冲淡，用喷雾器喷射在茶树老叶的背面就成了。喷肥后隔四—六天再采茶。
    茶树经过喷射后，四、五天即可见效，主要表现：叶芽迅速萌发，生长力强，新梢长到一芽五、六叶，不会成驻芽。另外，蒿枝水还有杀虫效力。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　		（惠来）
