Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: The two-day conference held by the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs concluded today. The conference decided that the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament will be held in Tokyo from August 2nd to 9th this year. The conference approved the policy guidelines for the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, which were adopted by the expanded meeting of the Council's Board of Directors at the end of January.

The conference decided that the preparatory meeting for the Sixth World Conference will be held from August 2nd to 4th. Foreign representatives and a small number of Japanese representatives will participate in the preparatory meeting. Nearly 10,000 Japanese representatives will participate when the conference officially opens. The meeting emphasized that it will strive to enable the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to attend the conference. The conference also decided to launch a "5,000-kilometer Peace March from Okinawa and Hokkaido to Tokyo." The peace march will start from seven locations, including Yoron Island at the southernmost tip of Kagoshima Prefecture and Nemuro in Hokkaido, and arrive in Tokyo on August 5th. This march will include people from all walks of life in Japan and will be unprecedentedly large in scale. Marchers will pass in front of all military bases of the United States and the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces." Mass rallies, gatherings, and round table conferences will be held in the places the march passes through to awaken public opinion demanding complete disarmament, banning nuclear weapons, restoring Japan-China diplomatic relations, and opposing the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Today's conference also decided to submit a letter of opinion to the Nobusuke Kishi government, requesting the passage of laws prohibiting the nuclear armament of the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces," the conclusion of an agreement with the United States banning the transportation of nuclear weapons into Japan, the passage of laws prohibiting the dispatch of Japanese armed forces to areas not under Japanese jurisdiction, and the abolition of Japanese paratroopers. The letter of opinion firmly demands that these measures be taken before the Diet approves the new "Security Treaty."

The conference decided to issue an appeal to foreign countries, calling on the people of Asian and African countries to take joint action to oppose French nuclear weapons tests in the Sahara.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th: The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs decided today that the central content of the Council's action plan for this year is to promote complete disarmament and oppose the revival of Japanese militarism.

This action plan was adopted at the Council's national conference in Tokyo.

According to this action plan, the Council will continue to carry out movements to demand the prohibition of nuclear tests, the successful holding of East-West summit talks, respect for national sovereignty, and large-scale disarmament. The movement will also oppose France's plan to conduct nuclear tests in the Sahara Desert.

The action plan calls for opposing the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," opposing equipping the Japanese army with nuclear weapons, and opposing the enactment of the so-called "Anti-Espionage Law" to suppress the people in the anti-atomic bomb movement. The movement will demand the establishment of friendly relations with neighboring countries, demand that the United States return Okinawa to Japan, and demand that adequate relief measures be taken for atomic bomb victims. The action plan also emphasizes that the Council will demand that the government and the Diet enact laws prohibiting the entry of nuclear weapons into Japan, prohibiting the armament of Japan with nuclear weapons, and prohibiting the dispatch of Japanese troops abroad.

In its action plan, the Council requires its members to develop anti-atomic bomb organizations throughout the country, including all factories and all prefectures. It also calls on the branches to strengthen their struggle against the activities of saboteurs who stubbornly continue to oppose the Council.

The conference also decided today that the Council will hold a mass rally on March 1st to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the Bikini incident in which Japanese fishermen were injured by a U.S. hydrogen bomb. This mass rally will be named "National Conference to Realize the Prohibition of Nuclear Tests, Demand Complete Disarmament, and Oppose the Ratification of the New Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty'." This mass rally will be held with the support of the National Council to Prevent Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the Tokyo Metropolitan Joint Struggle Conference for the Defense of Peace and Democracy.

The conference also passed a resolution today launching a movement to provide relief to typhoon victims in Okinawa, who are in a very difficult situation due to food shortages.

Yasui Kaoru, Director of the Council, emphasized in his speech that "the main task of the movement this year is to unite the broad strata of the Japanese people on major political issues to prevent the dangerous trend of Japanese politics that runs counter to the current international situation."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: The National Council to Prevent Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" held a working group meeting today and adopted specific plans for holding the twelfth and thirteenth national unified actions.

The plan stipulates that the twelfth unified action will be held on the 25th of this month. On this day, all prefectures in Japan will simultaneously hold a large-scale march of "Preventing Revision of the Security Treaty, Defending Livelihood and Rights"; Tokyo will hold a national conference and demonstration of "Preventing Revision of the Security Treaty, Demanding the Compilation of a Peaceful Budget" with 50,000 participants on the same day.

The plan stipulates that the thirteenth unified action will be held on March 19th. On that day, a central conference will be held in Tokyo to summarize the achievements of the large-scale marches held in various prefectures. The joint struggle organizations throughout Japan plan to end on this day a signature campaign to collect 10 million signatures against the Diet's ratification of the new "Security Treaty."
