    New Quarrels Between the U.S. and France
    Xi Si
    During the annual meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Council and the Western summit, the intricate contradictions within imperialism were once again exposed, particularly the new and fierce quarrels between France and the United States. This dispute was mainly manifested in the military "integration" of NATO and the Algerian issue. U.S. Secretary of State Herter and French Foreign Minister Couve de Murville, U.S. President Eisenhower and French President de Gaulle held talks successively, but failed to bridge the serious differences between the U.S. and France.

    Dispute over "Integration"
    The issue of NATO's military "integration" is an important manifestation of the struggle between control and anti-control between the United States and Western European countries in the military field. The so-called military "integration" is to unify the armed forces of various member states under the command of the Supreme Command controlled by the United States, thereby enabling the United States to fully control Western European countries militarily. At present, while paying lip service to "peace," the United States is seeking to strengthen its "position of strength" and prevent the loosening of the ties of the military bloc it controls. It is attempting to use this NATO Council meeting to drive Western European countries to strengthen their arms expansion and war preparations and accelerate the "integration" of the armies of the member states.

    However, with the exception of West Germany, which is bent on relying on U.S. support to accelerate rearmament, other member states do not seem enthusiastic about this U.S. plan, and France is the main obstacle to the U.S. in promoting its "integration" plan.

    Since de Gaulle came to power, he has put forward propositions that are diametrically opposed to those of the United States, demanding the reorganization of NATO's "defense" system and advocating that member states maintain direct control over their own military forces. De Gaulle openly stated: "I hope to completely change the laborious approach of merging the armies of the allies, and establish a new cooperation system on a country-by-country basis." De Gaulle declared: "France must rely on itself, for itself, and defend itself in its own way, this is essential." Moreover, de Gaulle has already been acting on his own in practical actions, creating difficulties for NATO on a series of issues. As early as December 1958, France refused the plan to merge NATO fighter units and integrate air defense, which has stalled this plan to this day; in March 1959, de Gaulle announced the withdrawal of the command of the French fleet in the Mediterranean; in addition, France has always refused the United States to set up medium-range missile bases and store nuclear weapons on its territory.

    In response to France's attitude, the United States first openly exerted pressure on France on the eve of the NATO Council meeting. General Twining, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, at a secret meeting of the NATO Military Committee on December 10 last year, accused most member states of failing to fulfill their military obligations to the group, directly targeting France, saying it was the "culprit." Afterwards, the U.S. authorities deliberately leaked the content of this accusation, causing an uproar. But de Gaulle still insisted on his position. On December 15, when talking with French parliamentary leaders, he said that France no longer agreed to the "implementation of the alliance," reiterated his opposition to military "integration," and advocated "finding a middle ground between integration and mere association." Eisenhower held talks with de Gaulle while visiting France to attend the Western summit. Eisenhower insisted that France obey the unified command of NATO, while de Gaulle still stated that "France's defense must be autonomous and French." The contradiction between France and the United States on "integration" has not been alleviated.

    De Gaulle Demands to Share Leadership of the West
    The reason why the contradiction between France and the United States on military "integration" has remained unresolved is because this is not simply a struggle between control and anti-control between France and the United States in the military field. This issue is primarily an important part of de Gaulle's attempt to share the leadership of the Western world.

    De Gaulle's attitude towards military "integration" reflects de Gaulle's view of the role of NATO and France's position in this group.

    In the military field, de Gaulle demanded that French generals hold more senior military positions within the group, changing the situation where the United States or the United States and Britain jointly controlled the situation; he also attempted to use the power of NATO to suppress the African national independence movement to stabilize French colonial rule, advocating the establishment of a "Paris-Algiers-Brazzaville's huge French axis" as NATO's main strategic base, and the establishment of an African command headed by a Frenchman. De Gaulle is unwilling to transfer the French army to NATO's unified command under the current circumstances. At the same time, maintaining direct control over his own military forces puts France in a more flexible position in dealing with the growth of West German military strength or in suppressing colonial national independence movements.

    Politically, as early as September 1958, de Gaulle formally proposed to the United States and Britain the establishment of a three-nation core leadership. When this request was coldly received by the United States, de Gaulle used military "go-slow" as an important means of bargaining with the United States.

    It can be seen that the quarrel over military "integration" is an important aspect of the fundamental differences between the United States and France, and it is difficult to resolve it for a while. But this does not preclude the two countries from reaching limited compromises on local issues. According to Western news agencies, France may agree to "technical cooperation" with the "integrated" air force command and allow NATO to build radar and other technical equipment on French territory. This possibility exists.

    In short, the new quarrel between France and the United States on military "integration" shows that NATO is not only deepening its political and economic divisions, but also its military divisions are expanding; at the same time, it shows that the United States is in a state of serious weakening of its political and economic position in the Western world, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to tighten its control over its allies.

    Overt and Covert Struggles on the Algerian Issue
    Since de Gaulle came to power, the overt and covert struggles between France and the United States on the Algerian issue have never stopped. De Gaulle has tried his best to resist the U.S. involvement in North Africa and interference in the Algerian issue, while at the same time, in the name of "Atlantic solidarity," he demanded that the U.S. support France on the Algerian issue.

    The United States, on the one hand, uses economic assistance and political wooing to expand U.S. influence in Tunisia and Morocco. Eisenhower's recent visits to Tunisia and Morocco were mainly for this purpose; on the other hand, it attempts to intervene in behind-the-scenes mediation activities in order to intervene in Algerian affairs. The U.S. ruling group believes that the continuation of the Algerian War is of some benefit to it. It can use the situation where France needs it politically and militarily as a means of controlling France, and it can also use the anti-French sentiment in North Africa to squeeze out French influence. However, the U.S. ruling group is deeply afraid of the continuation and expansion of the Algerian anti-colonial war, because the continuation of the war makes the situation in Africa more unstable, affecting the expansion activities of U.S. monopoly capital groups in Africa; moreover, the U.S. is worried that if the war continues, the nationalist forces in Algeria will become increasingly stronger, which is not conducive to U.S. intervention in Algeria. Therefore, the United States once considered resolving the Algerian issue with a Cyprus-style solution. After de Gaulle announced on September 16 last year that he recognized the "right to self-determination" of the Algerian people, the United States actively planned behind-the-scenes mediation activities in an attempt to open the way for the U.S. to intervene in Algerian affairs.

    In addition, in order to maintain its hypocritical image of anti-colonialism among the people of Asia and Africa, the United States is unwilling to explicitly support France's Algerian policy.

    This new quarrel was caused by the United States' abstention in the United Nations General Assembly vote on the proposal on the Algerian issue and Eisenhower's visit to Tunisia. Originally, during Eisenhower's visit to France in September last year, in order to temporarily ease the contradictions between France and the United States in order to seek superficial unity in the West, so as to strengthen his position during his talks with Khrushchev, Eisenhower expressed to de Gaulle that he was willing to support de Gaulle's new plan for Algeria. After de Gaulle's statement on September 16, Eisenhower publicly expressed his support in principle, and Herter also stated that the United States hoped not to "take actions that would hinder a just and peaceful solution to the Algerian issue" at the United Nations. When the UN Political Committee voted on the proposal of the 22 Asian and African countries, the United States voted against it, which was criticized by Asian and African countries and aroused strong dissatisfaction from the Algerian provisional government. As a result, the United States abstained from voting on the Pakistani proposal at the UN General Assembly. This made France extremely dissatisfied, and de Murville accused the United States of "selling out France" on the Algerian issue. On December 17, the communiqué of the talks between Eisenhower and Bourguiba openly mentioned that they "studied the situation caused by the difficulties in Algeria" and unanimously believed that "the fact that a solution has not been achieved is a cause for serious unrest." This blatant attempt by the United States to interfere in the Algerian issue only added fuel to the fire, making France even more annoyed. In this meeting between de Gaulle and Eisenhower, de Gaulle once again demanded that the United States support France on the Algerian issue; Eisenhower said on the one hand that the United States "fully supported" de Gaulle's new plan, and on the other hand, said that the United States "still has to consider its relationship with the emerging countries of the world." It seems that the infighting between the United States and France on this issue will continue to develop.

    To sum up, France and the United States have not reached any agreement on military "integration" and the Algerian issue, and the fundamental differences between France and the United States are deepening. However, under the situation where the East-West summit meeting is determined to be held, neither side is willing to make the relationship between the two countries too tense. The announcement that de Gaulle will visit the United States in April this year at the invitation shows this trend in Franco-American relations. But the contradictions between imperialist countries can never be truly reconciled.

    美法的新争吵
    希斯
    在北大西洋集团理事会年会和西方首脑会议期间，帝国主义内部再次暴露了错综复杂的矛盾，特别是法美之间发生了新的激烈争吵。这次争吵集中表现在北大西洋集团军事“一体化”和阿尔及利亚问题上。美国国务卿赫脱和法国外交部长德姆维尔，美国总统艾森豪威尔和法国总统戴高乐相继举行了会谈，但都没有能弥合法美之间的严重分歧。
    在“一体化”问题上的争执
    北大西洋集团军事“一体化”问题，是美国同西欧国家之间控制与反控制斗争在军事方面的重要表现。所谓军事“一体化”，就是把各成员国的武装力量统一在由美国控制的最高司令部的指挥之下，从而使美国在军事上全面控制西欧国家。目前，美国为了在侈谈“和平”的同时谋求加强其“实力地位”和防止它所控制的军事集团的纽带的松弛，企图通过这次北大西洋集团理事会会议，驱使西欧各国加强扩军备战的活动和加速各成员国军队的“一体化”。
    但是，除了一心依靠美国扶植加速重新武装的西德而外，其他成员国对美国这一计划显得并不热心，而法国更是美国推行其“一体化”计划的主要障碍。
    戴高乐上台以来，提出了同美国针锋相对的主张，要求改组北大西洋集团的“防务”体系，主张各成员国保持对本国的军事力量的直接控制。戴高乐公开表示：“希望完全改变想把盟国军队合并起来的吃力的作法，而在一国一国的基础上建立新的合作制度。”戴高乐宣称：“法国要靠它自己，为它自己和用它自己的方法来自卫，这是必不可少的”。而且，戴高乐已经在实际行动中自行其是，在一系列问题上给北大西洋集团制造困难。早在1958年12月法国即拒绝北大西洋集团战斗机部队合并和空防一体化的计划，使这个计划搁浅至今；1959年3月戴高乐又宣布收回法国在地中海的舰队的指挥权；此外，法国一直拒绝美国在其领土上设置中程导弹基地和储存核武器。
    针对法国这种态度，美国在北大西洋集团理事会会议前夕，首先对法国公开施加压力。美国参谋长联席会议主席特文宁在去年12月10日在北大西洋集团军事委员会秘密会议上，指责大多数成员国没有履行它们对这个集团所承担的军事义务，其矛头直接指向法国，说它是“祸首”。事后，美国当局又故意泄露这种指责的内容，引起轩然大波。但戴高乐仍然坚持他的主张。12月15日他在同法国议会领袖谈话时表示，法国不再同意“联盟的实施方式”，重申反对军事“一体化”，主张“找到一种在一体化和仅仅是联合之间的中间办法”。艾森豪威尔在赴法参加西方首脑会议期间，同戴高乐举行了会谈。艾森豪威尔坚持要法国服从北大西洋集团的统一指挥，而戴高乐仍表示“法国的防御必须是自主的和法国的”。法美在“一体化”方面的矛盾仍未缓和下来。
    戴高乐要求分享西方领导权
    法美在军事“一体化”问题上的矛盾之所以一直僵持未决，因为这不单是法美在军事上控制与反控制的斗争，这个问题首先是戴高乐企图分享西方世界领导权的斗争的一个重要组成部分。
    戴高乐对军事“一体化”的态度，反映了戴高乐对北大西洋集团的作用和法国在这个集团中的地位的看法。
    在军事上，戴高乐要求让法国将领在集团内部担任更多的高级军职，改变由美国或美英联合把持的局面；他并且企图借用北大西洋集团的力量来镇压非洲民族独立运动以稳定法国的殖民统治，主张建立“巴黎—阿尔及尔—布拉柴维尔的巨大的法国轴心”，作为北大西洋集团的主要战略基地，并且设立一个由法国人担任司令的非洲司令部。戴高乐不愿在目前情况下将法国军队拨交北大西洋集团统一指挥，同时，保持对本国军事力量的直接控制，使法国无论在对付西德军事实力的增长或在镇压殖民地民族独立运动方面都处于较为机动的地位。
    在政治上，戴高乐早在1958年9月就向美英正式提出建立三国核心领导的建议，在这个要求受到美国冷遇的情况下，戴高乐就以军事上的“怠工”作为向美国讨价还价的重要手段。
    由此可见，关于军事“一体化”的争吵，是美法之间的基本分歧的重要方面，一时势难得到解决。但这并不排斥两国在局部问题上取得有限度的妥协。据西方通讯社透露，法国可能同意同“一体化”的空军司令部进行“技术性合作”，允许北大西洋集团在法国领土上修建雷达和其他技术设备，这种可能性是存在的。
    总之，法美在军事“一体化”问题上的新争吵表明北大西洋集团不但在政治上和经济上的分裂日益加深，军事上的分裂也日益扩大；同时表明：美国在西方世界的政治地位和经济地位严重削弱的形势下，要想加紧控制盟国已经越来越困难了。
    在阿尔及利亚问题上的明争暗斗
    戴高乐上台以来，法美在阿尔及利亚问题上的明争暗斗一直没有停止过。戴高乐竭力抗拒美国染指北非和干预阿尔及利亚问题，同时又以“大西洋团结”为名要求美国在阿尔及利亚问题上支持法国。
    美国则一方面通过经济援助和政治拉拢伸张美国在突尼斯、摩洛哥的势力，最近艾森豪威尔访问突、摩的主要目的就在于此；另一方面企图插手幕后调停活动，以便过问阿尔及利亚事务。美国统治集团认为，阿尔及利亚战争的延续对它是有一定好处的，它可以利用法国在政治上军事上有求于它的形势下作为控制法国的手段，也可以利用北非的反法情绪排挤法国的势力。但是美国统治集团对阿尔及利亚反殖民战争的继续和扩大又深为害怕，因为战争的延续使非洲局面更加不稳，影响到美国垄断资本集团在非洲的扩张活动；而且美国担心战争继续下去，使阿尔及利亚的民族主义力量日益增强，对美国插手阿尔及利亚不利。因此，美国曾一度酝酿以塞浦路斯式的方案解决阿尔及利亚问题。去年9月16日戴高乐发表承认阿尔及利亚人民享有“自决权”以后，美国又积极策划幕后斡旋活动，企图为美国过问阿尔及利亚事务开辟道路。
    此外，美国为了在亚非人民中间保持其反殖民主义的虚伪面目，不愿明确支持法国的阿尔及利亚政策。
    这次新的争吵是由于美国在联合国大会表决关于阿尔及利亚问题的提案时弃权和艾森豪威尔访问突尼斯而引起的。原来，在去年9月艾森豪威尔访法时，美国为了暂时缓和法美矛盾以求得西方的表面一致，以便加强他同赫鲁晓夫会谈时的地位，艾森豪威尔曾向戴高乐表示，愿意支持戴高乐关于阿尔及利亚的新计划。戴高乐9月16日声明发表后，艾森豪威尔公开表示原则上的支持，赫脱也表示美国希望不要在联合国“采取足以阻碍关于阿尔及利亚问题的公正而和平的解决办法的行动”。联大政委会表决亚非二十二国提案时，美国投票反对，因而受到亚非国家的指责，并引起阿尔及利亚临时政府的强烈不满。于是，美国在联大表决巴基斯坦提案时弃权。这使法国极为不满，德姆维尔指责美国在阿尔及利亚问题上“出卖了法国”。12月17日艾森豪威尔同布尔吉巴会谈公报中公然提到，他们“研究了由于阿尔及利亚的困难所产生的局势”，并且一致认为“还没有取得解决办法是造成严重不安的原因”。美国这种公然企图干预阿尔及利亚问题的作法，不啻火上加油，使法国更加恼火。在这次戴高乐和艾森豪威尔会谈中，戴高乐再度要求美国在阿尔及利亚问题上支持法国；艾森豪威尔一面表示美国“完全支持”戴高乐的新计划，一面又说美国“还得考虑它同世界新兴国家的关系”。看来，美法在这个问题上的勾心斗角将继续发展下去。
    综上所述，法美在军事“一体化”和阿尔及利亚问题上都未取得任何协议，法美基本分歧日益加深。但是，在东西方首脑会议确定召开的形势下，双方都不愿使两国关系过于紧张，宣布戴高乐将于今年4月应邀访美，就显示了法美关系的这一趋向。但是帝国主义国家之间的矛盾无论怎样都是无法取得真正的调和的。
