    Strive for the Initiative Step by Step, and You Can Lead in Everything:
    Spring Comes Early to the Jiuling People's Commune
    Preparing for Spring Plowing to Achieve Perfection in Fertilizer Accumulation, Land Preparation, Seeds, Tools, and Technology

    (Our Dispatch) The Jiuling Commune in Chongyang, Hubei, completed the tasks of water control, soil improvement, and mountain management ahead of schedule in the winter production campaign, excellently carried out field management of overwintering crops, and also prepared for spring plowing to achieve perfection in fertilizer accumulation, land preparation, seeds, tools, and technology.
    As early as the end of last year, this commune victoriously completed the tasks of mountain management, water control, and soil improvement. In terms of water conservancy construction, it built the "Zhiquan," "Henglong," and "Shenlong" reservoirs and a hundred-li-long canal, which can guarantee self-flowing irrigation for 50,000 mu of farmland. More than 43,000 mu of wasteland was reclaimed and all converted into terraced fields, all planted with winter crops. The commune's cultivated land area expanded from more than 41,000 mu last year to more than 83,000 mu. At present, all wheat, spring beans, and rapeseed have been weeded twice and top-dressed twice, growing vigorously and adorably. The commune plans to increase the area for early rice transplanting by 60% compared with last year, of which 11,000 mu of winter-fallowed land have all undergone two plowings and two harrows; 3,913 mu of seedling fields have generally undergone four plowings and four harrows, with each field soaked in water. The work of accumulating fertilizer for spring sowing has also been done very well. The scattered manure piles in the fields are full of high-quality fertilizer. On average, nearly 200 dan of fertilizer has been accumulated per mu for the planned sowing of more than 34,000 mu of early and mid-season rice, and most of the fertilizer has been delivered to the fields. The commune's spring-sown crops need seeds, which are self-sufficient through inventorying, adjusting, and exchanging. 212 seed warehouses have been established, with dedicated personnel for safekeeping. Basically, all of the more than 105,000 pieces of large and small farm tools needed for spring plowing have been repaired and replenished. Each production team established a technical night school, training 2,280 rice transplanters. Through night schools and field meetings, a major technical debate centered on close planting was launched, and reasonable close planting and other advanced technical measures for this year were determined.
    The important experience of Jiuling Commune in achieving comprehensive victory in winter production is that the commune party committee constantly analyzes the situation, makes comprehensive plans for the entire winter production campaign, makes unified arrangements, arranges in stages, makes breakthroughs in stages, with each link closely connected to the next, striving for the initiative step by step and leading in everything. Due to the heavy tasks, high demands, and tight time constraints of winter production last year, some cadres and commune members initially had great ideological resistance. At that time, the entire commune drew more than 3,000 laborers from more than 6,000 laborers to build water conservancy projects. Some cadres and commune members who stayed at home to engage in production expressed that they had no confidence in completing the tasks. In response to this ideological situation, the commune party committee decided to launch a large-scale ideological upgrade campaign. The entire commune successively held five on-site meetings, adopting methods such as "see if you don't understand, debate if you don't get it," posting big-character posters, and rectifying style in the fields, widely and deeply carrying out a major debate on "can one hand catch two fish?" In this way, the conservative idea of "doing a good job in the 'Three Controls' will not lead to good agriculture" was completely eliminated. On the basis of improving ideological understanding, the entire commune set off a labor competition between people and people, groups and groups, teams and teams, management areas and management areas, the front and the rear, which further boosted the enthusiasm of the masses. In this way, the first victory was achieved in water conservancy work, and the task of five months was completed in fifty days. Immediately afterward, the commune party committee timely analyzed this year's production characteristics: due to the vigorous development of the "Three Controls" campaign, the commune's cultivated land area doubled compared with last year, the area of overwintering crops increased eight times compared with last year, and the area of early rice transplanting increased by more than half. Therefore, this year's spring production workload is heavier than last year, and the phenomenon of labor shortage is more prominent. According to this situation, the slogan put forward by the commune party committee is: focus on water conservancy, make a breakthrough in field management, vigorously grasp spring plowing preparation, combine to develop sideline occupations, and strive to achieve everything red. According to this requirement, they adopted the mass movement of leaders assigning tasks, arranging labor, advancing in four directions, and making a big fuss about winter production.
    Throughout the entire winter production process, the commune party committee also focused on tool reform and labor management, and vigorously carried out the high-efficiency movement, based on the characteristics of large tasks and short time this year. On the water conservancy front, 23 items of 1,342 new tools were manufactured, and the average daily work efficiency of each person in the commune increased to 8.1%. Xu Yiyu, the secretary of the commune party committee, went deep into the Henglong Reservoir construction site, and together with carpenter Wu Bingrong and Communist Youth League member Hu Xingfa, created a double-car automatic soil transportation machine, with each person transporting 333 cubic meters of soil per day. The technological innovation achievements of the water conservancy construction site powerfully promoted the innovation movement on the agricultural front. The entire commune universally promoted hill-by-hill cellar storage, accumulating fertilizer in the fields, and realized the trailerization of fertilizer delivery. More than 2,100 fertilizer transportation boats were promoted, which increased work efficiency by three to four times compared with carrying by people.
    In addition, the commune party committee also implemented the policy of grasping production with one hand and grasping life with the other, making specific and detailed arrangements for the lives of commune members. The commune drew one secretary of the party committee and led 1,100 laborers to develop diversified operations and vigorously seize cash income. These measures powerfully promoted the surging enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members, and the production upsurge rolled forward.

    步步争取主动　事事就能领先
    九岭人民公社春光早临
    备耕工作做到积肥整田种子工具技术五全其美
    本报讯　湖北崇阳九岭公社在冬季生产运动中提前完成了治水、治土、治山的任务，出色地作好了越冬作物的田间管理，同时春耕准备工作也做到了积肥、整田、种子、工具、技术“五全其美”。
    这个公社早在去年年底就胜利的完成了治山、治水和治土的任务。在水利建设方面，修成了“治泉”、“横龙”、“神龙”三座大水库和一条百里长渠，可以保证五万亩田地自流灌溉。开垦了四万三千多亩荒地，并都改成了梯田梯地，全部种上了冬季作物。全社耕地面积就由去年的四万一千多亩扩大到八万三千亩。目前，所有小麦、春豆和油菜，普遍锄了两次草，追了两道肥，长的茁壮可爱。全社早稻插秧面积计划比去年增加60％，其中一万一千亩冬闲田全部经过了两犁两耙；三千九百一十三亩秧田普遍进行了四犁四耙，块块田泡上了水。春播积肥工作也做得十分出色，星罗棋布的田头粪垱都装满了优质肥料，计划播种的三万四千多亩早、中稻平均每亩已经积到将近二百担肥料，并且把大部分肥料送到了田里。全社春播作物需要的种子，通过清仓摸底、调剂互换等办法，做到自给自足，还分别建立了二百一十二个种子仓库，实行了专人保管。春耕生产需要的十万五千多件大小农具，基本上全部修补、添置就绪。各生产队成立了技术夜校，训练了二千二百八十名插秧手，通过夜校和田头会议，开展了以密植为中心的技术大辩论，确定了今年合理密植及其他先进技术措施。
    九岭公社冬季生产获得全面胜利的重要经验是，公社党委不断分析形势，对整个冬季生产运动进行全面规划，统一布置，分段安排，逐段突击，一环紧套一环，争取了步步主动，事事领先。这个公社由于去年冬季生产任务繁重，要求高，时间紧，开始部分干部和社员的思想抵触很大。当时，全社从六千多个劳力中抽出了三千多个劳力去兴修水利，留在家里搞生产的干部和社员中有人表示没有信心完成任务，针对这种思想情况，公社党委决定开展一个大规模的思想升级运动。全社连续召开了五次现场会议，采取不明就看，不通就辩，贴大字报，田头整风等办法，广泛深入地开展了一场“一双手能不能捉住两条鱼”的大辩论。这样，彻底消除了“搞好‘三治’就搞不好农业”的保守思想。在思想认识提高的基础上，全社掀起一个人与人、组与组、队与队、管理区与管理区、前方与后方的劳动竞赛，这就进一步鼓足了群众的干劲。这样，在水利工作方面首先取得了胜利，五个月的任务五十天就完成了。紧接着公社党委又及时分析今年生产特点是，由于“三治”运动的蓬勃开展，全社耕地面积比去年扩大了一倍，越冬作物面积比去年扩大了八倍，早稻插秧面积增加一半以上，因而今年春季生产工作量比去年更加繁重，劳力不足现象更加突出。根据这一情况，公社党委提出的口号是：主攻水利，突击田间管理，狠抓备耕，结合开展副业，力争做到样样红。根据这个要求，他们采取了领导分工，劳力排队，四路进军，大闹冬季生产的群众运动。
    公社党委在整个冬季生产过程中，还根据今年任务大、时间短的特点，狠抓工具改革和劳动管理，大力开展高工效运动。在水利战线上，制造了二十三项一千三百四十二件新工具，全社每人每天平均工效提高到八点一方。公社党委书记徐怡玉深入横龙水库工地，同木工吴炳荣、共青团员胡兴发创造了双车自动运土机，每人每天运土三百三十三立方米。水利工地的技术革新成就，有力地推动了农业战线的革新运动，全社普遍推行了丘丘窖垱，就田积肥，并实现了送粪拖板化，推广运粪船两千一百多只，比人挑工效提高三、四倍。
    此外，公社党委还贯彻了一手抓生产，一手抓生活的方针，对社员生活作了具体细致的安排。公社抽出党委书记一人，带领一千一百个劳动力，开展多种经营，大抓现金收入。这些措施，有力地促使广大社员干劲冲天，生产高潮滚滚向前。
