(Our Dispatch from Guangzhou, 4th) The Jinpu Commune in Chaoyang County, Guangdong Province – a commune that achieved a thousand jin per mu in late rice in 1959 – has completed its preparations for spring plowing ahead of schedule before the Spring Festival, according to higher standards. Whether in terms of irrigation and drainage conditions, the quantity and quality of manure accumulation, or the leveling and improvement of the land, it has greatly exceeded previous years. Now, more than 1,600 mu of seedling fields in the commune have been basically prepared, and the first batch of cold-resistant japonica rice seeds has been sown.

This commune, which won the red flag for achieving a high yield of a thousand jin per mu of late rice last year, did not have good natural conditions originally. Over the past ten years since liberation, it has vigorously managed mountains, rivers, and soil, and rice yields have increased year by year, reaching a yield of a thousand jin per mu in the late crop last year. This year, the cadres and masses of the commune are in high spirits and determined to implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture according to higher standards, striving to make the yield of early rice this year catch up with and surpass that of last year's late crop.

Now, the slogan of the Jinpu Commune to "implement the Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture according to higher standards" has become a reality. Before the Spring Festival, each mu of the commune's 8,300 mu of early rice fields had accumulated an average of more than 800 dan of various fertilizers, and 85% had been delivered to the fields. This amount of base fertilizer has increased threefold compared to the same period last year, and it has also doubled compared to last year's late crop. The commune's work of deep plowing to improve soil and leveling land has also been completed ahead of schedule. All paddy fields have been deep-plowed to a depth of five to eight inches, and all have been plowed three to four times; more than 1,000 mu of mountain pit fields with heavier sandy soil have been fertilized with an additional 600 dan of sea mud and pond mud per mu this year, and other paddy fields have also been added with sand or mud according to different conditions; all paddy fields have been smoked with soil, and all have met the requirements of "deep, soft, and fertile." At the same time, the commune has leveled more than 4,300 mu of land, and also repaired the roads in the fields, so that the land is as smooth as a mirror and the roads are neat and wide, which is convenient for irrigation and cultivation, as well as field transportation. In terms of water conservancy, 97 new drainage and irrigation ditches have been built this year, and all paddy fields have further achieved automated irrigation and drainage. As the conditions of water, fertilizer, and soil have been further improved, the area of paddy fields has been expanded by a total of 1,100 mu, and the area of dry land has been expanded by 1,400 mu, through methods such as converting single-cropping fields into double-cropping fields, changing dry land into paddy fields, and actively reclaiming wasteland.

During the Spring Festival, the members of the Jinpu Commune held a spring plowing mobilization meeting, and decided to complete the sowing work in batches from the Beginning of Spring to the Rain Water period, and to complete the transplanting work with all their strength around the Vernal Equinox. Each production brigade challenged each other at the mobilization meeting, guaranteeing to achieve a good start in spring plowing production. At 5:00 a.m. on January 30, all 14,500 members of the commune immediately devoted themselves to the work of preparing fields, sowing seeds, transporting fertilizer, and reclaiming wasteland, and strived to complete the work according to higher standards. Now, more than 1,600 mu of seedling fields in the commune have been basically prepared, and all seedling fields are fields with good soil quality, good irrigation and drainage conditions, and are sheltered from the wind and facing the sun, carefully selected by professional teams, and have been plowed many times, with sufficient base fertilizer applied and overwintering pests eliminated. All the improved varieties have also been prepared, and more than 80% are the famous early rice improved variety in Guangdong Province – Dwarf Nant. This improved variety has short and strong stalks, and has the advantages of not lodging, being resistant to fertilizer, having large ears, many grains, and heavy grains. The specifications for dense planting have also been formulated, and planting specifications such as 5×3, 5×4, and 6×4 are adopted according to various different soil qualities and conditions such as mountain pit fields and plain fields. For mountain pit fields and semi-sandy soil fields with weak tillering ability, the focus is on the main ears, while for plain fields with relatively fertile soil, the focus is on ensuring both the main ears and relying on tillering, striving to achieve more than 300,000 effective ears per mu.

    按更高标准贯彻农业八字宪法
    金浦公社初播丰收种
    基肥比去年同期增加三倍，85％已经送到田里
    全部稻田做到“深、软、肥”，实现排灌自流化
    本报广州4日电　广东省1959年晚稻千斤公社——潮阳县金浦公社，今年的备耕工作按照更高的标准提前在春节前全部完成。无论水利的排灌条件，积肥的数量和质量，土地的平整和改良，都大大超过往年。现在，全社一千六百多亩秧地已基本上整好，第一批耐寒的粳稻种子已经播下。
    这个夺得去年晚稻千斤高产红旗的公社，原来的自然条件并不好，解放十年来大力治山、治水、治土，水稻产量逐年上升，去年晚造达到亩产千斤。今年，全社干部群众意气风发，决定按更高的标准来贯彻农业“八字宪法”，争取今年早稻的产量赶上和超过去年晚造。
    现在，金浦公社“按更高标准贯彻农业八字宪法”的口号已经变为现实。到春节前，全社八千三百亩早稻田，平均每亩已积各种肥料八百多担，85％已经送到田里。这个基肥的数量，比去年同期增加了三倍，比去年晚造也增加了一倍。这个社的深翻改土和平整土地的工作，也已提前完成。全部稻田深耕达五寸到八寸，并且全部翻土三次到四次；一千多亩沙质较重的山坑田，今年每亩又增施了海泥和塘泥六百担，其他稻田也根据不同情况分别加了沙或入了泥；所有稻田经过熏土，全部达到了“深、软、肥”的要求。同时，全社平整了土地四千三百多亩，还修整了田间的道路，达到土地平整如镜，道路整齐宽阔，既便于灌溉和耕作，又便于田间交通运输。在水利方面，今年新修了九十七条排灌沟，全部稻田进一步做到排灌自流化。由于水、肥、土的条件进一步改善，今年通过单造改双造、旱地变水田和积极开荒等办法，共扩大了水田面积一千一百亩，旱地一千四百亩。
    春节期间，金浦公社社员举行了春耕誓师大会，决定立春前后到雨水期间，分批完成播种工作，春分前后全力完成插秧。各个生产大队在誓师大会上互相挑战，保证实现春耕生产开门红。1月30日凌晨五时，全社一万四千五百多个社员即全部投入办田、播种、运肥、开荒等工作，并且力争按照更高的标准来完成。现在，全社一千六百多亩秧地已基本上整好，全部秧地都是经过专业队精心选择的土质好、排灌条件好和背风向阳的田地，而且都经过多次翻犁，下足了基肥和消灭了越冬虫害。良种也全部准备好了，80％以上是广东省著名的早稻良种——矮脚南特。这种良种秆矮而粗壮，具有不倒伏和耐肥、穗大、粒多、粒重等优点。密植的规格也已经制定，按照山坑田和平原田等各种不同的土质和条件，分别采取5×3、5×4和6×4等插植规格。对于山坑田和半沙质田等分蘖力较弱的田地，则以主穗为主，对于土壤比较肥沃的平原田，则保证主穗和依靠分蘖并重，力争每亩有效穗数达到三十万穗以上。
