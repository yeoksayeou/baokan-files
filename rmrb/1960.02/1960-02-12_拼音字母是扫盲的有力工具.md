Pinyin is a Powerful Tool for Literacy
Li Yunsheng, Director of Shandong Provincial Department of Education

    Since the beginning of winter, a massive campaign to eliminate illiteracy and promote spare-time learning has emerged in Shandong Province, with 11,430,000 people participating. However, based on past experience in literacy campaigns, whether consolidation work can be done promptly and effectively is the key to the success or failure of the campaign. Wanrong County in Shanxi Province has made remarkable achievements in this regard. They have not only rapidly eliminated illiteracy using pinyin, but also effectively consolidated and expanded the results of the literacy campaign, finding a way to help the working class fundamentally escape illiteracy and learn culture in a faster, better, and more economical way. Since the second half of 1958, some counties and cities in Shandong Province have also conducted pilot programs for literacy using pinyin. The pilot experience has also proven that literacy through pinyin is an effective method, and pinyin is indeed a powerful tool for eliminating illiteracy, consolidating, and expanding the results of literacy campaigns. We plan to systematically study the experience of Wanrong County on the basis of a comprehensive summary of the pilot work in Shandong Province, so that the experience of Wanrong County can blossom and bear fruit in Shandong Province. In order to effectively promote the experience of Wanrong County, after preliminary consideration, we are prepared to take the following measures:
    First, adhere to putting politics in command, do a good job in publicity, and through the current rectification and study, vigorously overcome the lack of understanding of the important significance of literacy through pinyin and the conservative thinking of fearing difficulties among education administrative departments at all levels; second, at the upcoming literacy and spare-time education conference in Shandong Province, thoroughly convey the Wanrong experience and propose specific measures; third, actively promote pinyin in literacy classes and spare-time elementary schools as a tool for consolidating and expanding the results of literacy campaigns and continuing to improve culture; fourth, do a good job in setting examples; the province will directly focus on Qingdao City and Pingyuan County, achieve results, and promote the general. Fifth, do a good job in cultivating and training key teachers in people-run schools, widely mobilize middle and primary school teachers to serve as tutors and take responsibility for teaching in their spare time; sixth, vigorously promote pinyin reading materials, and the province plans to publish a "Learn Culture" pinyin tabloid as supplementary reading material for literacy graduates.
    We believe that as long as we exert full effort, strive for the upstream, hold high the red flag of the general line, carefully summarize our own experience, and conscientiously learn from the experience of Wanrong County, and do our work diligently and practically, we will surely be able to advance the work of literacy through pinyin to a brand new stage.

    拼音字母是扫盲的有力工具
    山东省教育厅厅长　李芸生
    入冬以来，山东省出现了一个声势浩大的扫除文盲和业余学习高潮，参加人数达一千一百四十三万人。但从历年扫盲经验来看，能否及时而有效地做好巩固工作，是扫盲成败的关键问题。山西省万荣县在这方面做出了显著的成绩。他们利用拼音字母不仅迅速地扫除了文盲，而且极有成效地巩固和扩大了扫盲成果，找到了一个帮助工农群众从根本上摆脱文盲状态、多快好省地学习文化的办法。从1958年下半年以来，山东省一些县、市也搞了注音扫盲试点，试点经验同样证明注音扫盲是一个有效的扫盲办法，拼音字母确实是扫除文盲、巩固和扩大扫盲成果的有力工具。我们打算在全面总结山东省试点工作的基础上，系统地学习万荣县的经验，让万荣县的经验在山东省开花结果。为有效地推广万荣县的经验，经初步考虑，我们准备采取如下措施：
    一，坚持政治挂帅，做好宣传工作，通过当前的整风学习，大力克服各级教育行政部门对注音扫盲的重要意义认识不足和害怕困难的保守思想；二，在山东省即将召开的扫盲和业余教育会议上，详细传达万荣经验，并提出具体措施；三，在扫盲班和业余初等学校中积极推行拼音字母，作为巩固扩大扫盲成果和继续提高文化的工具；四，搞好典型；省直接抓青岛市和平原县，作出成绩，推动一般。五，做好骨干民校教师的培养训练工作，广泛发动中、小学教师，利用业余时间担任辅导和包教；六，大搞注音读物，省计划出刊“学文化”注音小报，作为扫盲毕业学员课外补充读物。
    我们相信，只要我们鼓足干劲，力争上游，高举总路线的红旗，很好地总结自己的经验，认真学习万荣县的经验，把工作做得踏踏实实，就一定能把注音扫盲工作推进到一个全新的阶段。
