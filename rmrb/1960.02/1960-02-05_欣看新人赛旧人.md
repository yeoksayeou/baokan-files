    Happily Watching New Talents Outshine the Old
    Mei Lanfang

    Just before the Spring Festival, we happily celebrated the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Opera School with hundreds of robust young successors of opera.

    I remember that in the early days of the Opera School, I participated in the work of the first admissions committee. Under the leadership of comrades such as Tian Han and Mr. Wang Yaoqing, we only recruited less than one hundred new students at that time. Looking at it today, it has not only developed into a school capable of accommodating five or six hundred students, but has also successively trained two hundred and several dozen graduates in Peking Opera and traditional opera music. Plus, the students in the basic skills training courses for teachers number nearly three hundred. In China, the "Fu Lian Cheng" opera troupe, the largest and oldest in the past, had only just over seven hundred students in its forty-two years, and many of them changed professions midway. No past opera troupe can compare with today's school.

    We have not only greatly exceeded the past in quantity, but also in terms of quality. I have seen the performances of the students of the Chinese Opera School many times. They are energetic on stage, not tired, have a serious attitude, and possess a spirit of collectivism. In their performances, they are willing to delve deeply and give full play to their strengths. They also have a certain level of political cultivation, and some of them have gloriously become Communist Party members or Communist Youth League members. They know the responsibilities that an opera worker should have in this great era. All of these embody the achievements of the Party's "all-round development, teaching according to aptitude" policy.

    The audience is the most rigorous judge of how well an opera school is run. One audience member said to me: "I used to have an idea that the newly trained students must be good in political awareness and cultural level, but these courses take up a lot of time, and I am afraid that the technical skills will not be as good as those of the old opera troupes. But when I saw the performances of the students of the Chinese Opera School, I immediately changed my mind. Their mouth, eyes, hands, body, and steps are all accurate. Actors in many roles have a good foundation. The Communist Party really has a way to educate people."

    Comrade Ouyang Yuqian also said that he was very excited when he saw the six female generals in armor come on stage together in the Chinese Opera School's performance of "The Yang Family Women," with their neat and stylish appearance. He also said: "Some people think that there will be no more old female roles after Gong Yunfu's death. I think Wang Jinghua, who plays She Taijun in 'The Yang Family Women,' is good. Not only does she sing correctly, but she also has acting in her body and face. Although her current skill is not as good as Mr. Gong's, her future is unlimited."

    From the conversations of these insiders and outsiders, it can be clearly seen that the Chinese Opera School, under the cultivation and leadership of the Party, has grown rapidly from nothing, from small to large. This living fact powerfully shatters the fallacies of "things are not as good as before" and "there is no one to carry on the tradition."

    In the past ten years, the Chinese Opera School has made great achievements and won the praise of the audience. However, we must not be satisfied with the existing achievements. We must continue to further improve the students' political level and artistic quality, so that everyone can truly be both red and expert. Training opera talents is very hard work for the teachers. Every word, every tune, every move, every pose must be carefully crafted and advanced in an orderly manner. The beginning is important, but guidance outside of lectures cannot be ignored. At the same time, teaching should be tailored to the students' conditions. Although the Chinese Opera School has gathered many excellent teachers, with the rapid development of the national construction cause, the school will inevitably develop day by day and continuously expand the new student team. This requires attention to the source of teachers. Therefore, how to tap the potential of teachers and cultivate new teachers needs to be placed in an appropriate position. In addition, I feel that the quantity and quality of older male roles and female lead roles who mainly sing in the opera school are still insufficient. In the past hundred years, the development of Peking Opera has been particularly prominent in singing and martial arts. When it comes to schools of opera, they are often characterized by singing. An opera student, in his childhood, must learn singing, acting, reciting, acrobatics, both civil and martial arts, and Kunqu Opera, but also develop with emphasis. Artistic study should focus on specializing in one skill and being versatile in many skills in order to continuously improve quality and finally climb the peak of art.

    The development of the Opera School has also gone through a tortuous path. Its achievements have been achieved in the constant struggle between proletarian and bourgeois ideology, with proletarian ideology constantly defeating bourgeois ideology. The Party's education policy not only teaches opera, but more importantly, teaches people and transforms people. Not only must we transform students, but also teachers. Everyone must carry out self-transformation. Transformation is endless. We must learn as we get older and transform as we get older. The Party requires each of us to deeply study Mao Zedong Thought and arm ourselves as opera workers who are both red and expert. I would like to encourage the teachers and students of the Opera School with this.

    欣看新人赛旧人
    梅兰芳
    春节前夕，我们和几百个健壮的青少年戏曲接班人，兴奋地一起欢度了中国戏曲学校建校十周年的校庆。
    记得在戏曲学校建校初期，我曾参加第一次招生委员会的工作，在田汉同志和王瑶卿先生等的主持下，那时只招进了不足一百名的新生。再看今天，它不但已发展成为能够容纳五六百名学生的学校，而且已经先后培养了二百几十名京剧科和戏曲音乐科的毕业生。再加上基本功师资进修班的学员，就将近三百名了。在我国，过去规模最大、历史最久的“富连成”科班，四十二年里，坐科的学生也不过七百多人，里面还有不少中途改了行的。过去的任何科班是无法能和今天的学校相比的。
    我们不仅在数量上大大地超过了已往，再从质量来看，我曾多次看过中国戏曲学校学生们的演出，他们在舞台上有朝气，不疲沓，态度严肃，有集体主义精神；在表演中都肯深入钻研，发挥自己的长处；并且具有一定的政治修养，其中有的人已光荣地成为共产党员或共青团员。他们知道生在这个伟大的时代里一个戏曲工作者所应有的责任，这些都体现了党的“全面发展、因材施教”的成果。
    一个戏曲学校办的成绩怎样，观众是最严峻的评判人。有一位观众对我说：“我原来有一种想法，新培养出来的学生，政治觉悟、文化程度一定都不错，但这些课程占去不少时间，技术方面的工夫，恐怕就不会比旧科班出色。可是当我看了中国戏曲学校学生的演出，马上改变了我的想法。他们的口、眼、手、身、步都有准谱，许多行当的演员，功底都好。共产党教育人真有办法。”
    欧阳予倩同志也说过，他看了中国戏曲学校演出的“杨门女将”中六个扎靠的女将一同出台，那种整齐边式的样子，非常兴奋。他又说：“有人认为龚云甫死后无老旦，我觉得‘杨门女将’里扮佘太君的王晶华就不错，不但唱得规矩，身上脸上都有戏，她目前的火候虽然还赶不上龚老先生，将来是未可限量的。”
    从上面这些内外行的谈话中，可以清楚地看出，中国戏曲学校在党的培育和领导下，从无到有，从小到大，已经迅速地成长起来了。这个活生生的事实，有力地粉碎了那些“今不如昔”“后继无人”的谬论。
    十年来，中国戏曲学校已经作出了很大成绩，博得观众的赞许。但是我们决不能满足于现有的成绩，要继续进一步提高学生的政治水平和艺术质量，使每个人真正做到又红又专。培养戏曲艺术人才，老师们的工作是非常辛苦的，一字一腔、一招一势，都要精雕细刻，循序前进；开蒙时固然重要，讲课以外的指导，也不能忽视。同时还要根据学生的条件因材施教。中国戏曲学校虽然已经集中了许多优秀的教师，但跟随着国家建设事业大跃进的形势，学校也势必一天天发展，不断扩大新生队伍，这就需要注意师资的来源问题。因此，如何发掘师资潜力，培养新的师资，就需要放到一个适当的位置上去。此外，我觉得戏曲学校的学生中，以唱工为主的老生、青衣的数量质量还有所不足。近百年来，京剧的发展，唱工和武工是比较突出的。谈到流派，往往以唱为特征，一个戏曲学生，在幼年时，当然唱做念打、文武昆乱都要学，但也要有重点地发展；艺术进修要讲求一专多能，才能不断提高质量，最后攀登艺术高峰。
    戏曲学校的发展，也是经过一条曲折道路的，它的成绩，是在无产阶级和资产阶级思想的不断斗争中，无产阶级思想不断战胜资产阶级思想而取得的。党的教育方针，不但教戏，更重要的是教人、改造人。不但要改造学生，也要改造老师，要大家进行自我改造。改造是无止境的，我们要学到老，改造到老。党要求我们每一个人深入地学习毛泽东思想，把自己武装成又红又专的戏曲工作者。我谨以此与戏曲学校的老师同学共勉。
