Mulberry Tree Layering Doubles Mulberry Leaf Production
　　Dangtou Production Team in Sheng County Universally Implements Layering in New and Old Mulberry Orchards

　　(Reported by this newspaper) The Dangtou Production Team of Chengdong Commune in Sheng County, Zhejiang Province, has adopted the method of layering mulberry trees for aerial close planting, resulting in more than doubling the mulberry leaf production in both new, robust, and old mulberry orchards.

　　In the winter of 1957, this team conducted layering experiments on eight fen of mulberry orchard. In 1958, the spring leaf yield was 1,156 jin, an increase of 110% compared to the same period in 1957. In 1959, the spring leaf yield was 2,669 jin, another increase of 110% compared to 1958. In addition to these eight fen, this advanced experience was fully promoted in the spring of 1959. Layering was carried out on 55.6 mu of the 80 mu dedicated mulberry orchard. Compared with mulberry orchards under the same conditions but without layering, the average yield of spring leaves increased by 57% per mu in the same year, and the annual yield more than doubled. The commune members reflected, "Layering close planting is a magic weapon for increasing mulberry leaf production."

　　In 1958, Jin Renquan, a cadre of the Dangtou Production Team, conducted experiments based on the layering experience of mulberry trees in other regions. After cultivating for the spring, summer, and autumn seasons, the results all showed increased production. At that time, some people said, "Although production has increased this year, it may decrease next year." The Party branch summarized Jin Renquan's experimental experience, believing that layering and increasing production had a scientific basis, and strongly supported the mulberry orchard cultivation professional team in conducting experiments. Mi Caijuan, the branch secretary, also participated in the layering experiment work with all the team cadres. After two years of successful experiments, conservative ideas have been broken, and layering is planned to be universally implemented this year.

　　The results of two years of experiments by the Dangtou Production Team have proven that mulberry tree layering has three major benefits:

　　First, rapid increase in production and low cost. Layered mulberry trees increase the production of spring leaves by 57% to 100% compared to non-layered trees. The annual leaf production increases by 110% to 114%. Layering does not require mulberry seedlings; each mu only needs two or three jin of rice straw or straw rope, and one worker. Therefore, it is simple and easy to implement, everyone can do it, and it saves labor and money.

　　Second, good germination and many new shoots. The germination rate of layered mulberry trees is 79.8%, which is 15.8% higher than that of non-layered trees. After layering, there are many new shoots. According to a survey of 30 branches with a length of about five chi each, each layered branch has 29 new shoots, while non-layered branches have only four. The number of new shoots on layered branches is more than six times that of non-layered branches.

　　Third, long branches and good leaf quality. After layering old and robust mulberry trees, each tree has an average of 180 branches with a total length of 614 chi, while non-layered trees have only 46 branches with a total length of only 207 chi. The branch length of layered mulberry trees increases by about two times compared to non-layered trees. After layering, the leaves are heavier and the leaf quality is better. Every jin of layered mulberry leaves contains only 203 leaves, while every jin of non-layered leaves contains 264 leaves, an increase in weight of 30%. The results of comparing silkworm rearing using layered and non-layered mulberry leaves in the spring, summer, and autumn of 1959 showed that the output of silkworms reared with layered mulberry leaves was higher in each period, and the amount of leaves used was less.

　　The main reason why mulberry tree layering can increase production is that after the mulberry branches are layered, the sunlight exposure area of the mulberry branches is expanded, the photosynthesis is strengthened, the ability to absorb underground nutrients is also strengthened, and fertilizer loss can be reduced, so that the mulberry trees grow rapidly, promoting more branches, more buds, longer branches, larger leaves, thicker leaves, stronger trees, and thicker branches.

### 桑树伏条桑叶倍增  嵊县宕头生产队新老桑园普遍进行伏条

    桑树伏条桑叶倍增
    嵊县宕头生产队新老桑园普遍进行伏条
    本报讯　浙江嵊县城东公社宕头生产队，采用桑树伏条空中密植方法，使新、壮、老桑园的桑叶产量都增产一倍以上。
    1957年冬天，这个队在八分地桑园上进行伏条试验，1958年共产春叶一千一百五十六斤，比1957年同期增产110％；1959年产春叶二千六百六十九斤，又比1958年增产了110％。除这八分地以外，1959年春天全面推广了这一先进经验，在八十亩专用桑园上伏条五十五亩六分，与同等条件而不伏条的桑园对比，当年春叶平均每亩增产57％，全年增产一倍以上。社员反映：“伏条密植是增产桑叶的法宝。”
    1958年宕头生产队干部金仁铨，根据外地桑树伏条经验进行试验，经过春、夏、秋三季的培育，结果都增产了。当时有些人又说：“今年虽然增产了，说不定明年就减产。”党支部总结了金仁铨的试验经验，认为伏条增产是有科学根据的，大力支持桑园培育专业队进行试验。支部书记宓彩娟也和全队干部一起参加伏条试验工作。经过两年试验都得到成功，保守思想已被破除，今年准备普遍进行伏条。
    宕头生产队两年试验的结果证明，桑树伏条有三大好处：
    第一，增产快、成本低。伏条的桑树比不伏条的当年春叶增产57％到100％。全年产叶量增加110％至114％。伏条不要用桑苗，每亩只需二、三斤稻草或草绳，一个人工。因此简便易行，人人会做，而且省工、省钱。
    第二，发芽好，新梢多。伏条的桑树发芽率为79．8％，比不伏条的多15．8％；伏条后新梢多，据每根条长约五尺的三十根枝条调查，伏条的每根有新梢二十九个，而不伏条的只有四个，伏条的新梢比不伏条的多六倍多。
    第三，枝条长，叶质好。老壮桑树伏条后，每株平均有枝条一百八十条，条长六百十四尺，而不伏条的每株只有四十六条，条长只有二百零七尺，伏条的桑树条长比不伏条的增加约二倍；伏条后，叶片重，叶质好，伏条的每斤桑叶只有二百零三片，比不伏条的每斤有二百六十四片，重量增加30％。这个队1959年春、夏、秋三期用伏条的桑叶与不伏条的桑叶养蚕对比结果，伏条桑叶养蚕的产量期期都高，用叶量少。
    桑树伏条能增产的原因主要是，桑条伏后扩大了桑枝的阳光照射面，光合作用加强了，吸收地下养分的力量也加强了，并可以减少肥分流失，使桑树生长迅速，促进条多、芽多、条长、叶大、叶厚、树壮、条粗。
