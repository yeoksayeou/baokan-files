	Birds of a Feather

	The calendar had barely turned a few pages into the sixties when Macmillan hurriedly embarked on his bumpy journey to Africa. The "friendship" and "multi-racial society" goods he was peddling were not popular. He suffered wave after wave of demonstrations and protests in Central Africa. Even at a banquet in a hotel, he discovered a "nitroglycerin bomb." It wasn't until the final leg of the journey, "to a white country in South Africa," that his nerves finally settled. However, to his dismay, he unexpectedly had a rather unpleasant argument with his "friends" in this dominion loyal to the Queen.

	On February 3, Macmillan delivered a speech in the South African Parliament, boasting that Britain both "opposes the idea that one race is inherently superior to another" and cares about "the political destiny of free people." Then, he seemed to solemnly announce, "Britain cannot support South Africa's racial policies." But this made South African Prime Minister Verwoerd furious. Disregarding etiquette, he publicly embarrassed Macmillan. Amidst applause from all the members of parliament, he more solemnly declared to Macmillan, "I cannot agree with all your statements," and warned him, "It does no good for one to try to hurt those who disagree with him." Relations became very tense for a time. The next day, at a grand state banquet, Verwoerd felt it necessary to reassure Mr. and Mrs. Macmillan by first stating that what he was about to say would be complimentary.

	Verwoerd refuted Macmillan seriously, from "policy" and "concepts of Western civilization" to "Christian philosophy," practically contradicting the distinguished guest on everything. However, as the saying goes, no discord, no concord. After this quarrel, it turned out that Macmillan's "non-racialism" and Verwoerd's racism were merely like two glasses of different colored wine served at their toast.

	Not to mention that racial discrimination and oppression in South Africa had already begun in the era when it was a British colony, and that Macmillan himself had indicated that Britain would continue to oppose condemning South Africa's racial discrimination policies in the United Nations. He also criticized the boycotts against South Africa. More importantly, the colonial rule that Britain exercised in its African colonies, which were more than twenty times larger than its homeland, was no different from the colonial rule that Britain exercised in South Africa in the past, and there was no essential difference between it and the rule that the white South African government now exercises over blacks and other people of color. When Macmillan "visited" Northern and Southern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, he heard angry cries of "freedom" and "let us get rid of white rule" from protesting Africans everywhere, forcing this "friendship" envoy to be constantly vigilant and tread cautiously. According to Reuters, when Macmillan attended morning prayer in a church in Livingstone, Northern Rhodesia, the number of security police doubled, and all Africans entering the church had to be searched. Africans refused to be searched and walked away, but Macmillan still asked his entourage nervously, "Haven't found any bombs today?" Here, the relationship between Britain and Central African blacks is no less tense than the relationship between the South African federal government and blacks. This is naturally the result of the British Empire's racial oppression of colonial peoples. Therefore, if Macmillan cannot help but complain that Central Africans lack "racial harmony" and "goodwill," then Verwoerd has every right to complain that Macmillan's criticism of South Africa's racial discrimination policy is too "unfair."

	Macmillan had to admit in the South African Parliament that "the most striking impression I have gained" during his trip to Africa was "the strength of African national consciousness," and that "the wind of change is blowing through the continent." Therefore, he believes that "our national policies must take this into account." But what kind of policies? Originally, it was necessary "to build the future of the Commonwealth and the free world... on the basis of Christian and free society laws." In simpler terms, it was necessary to save the collapse of the African colonial system. Thus, the truth came to light: Macmillan's criticism of South Africa was out of good intentions. He said that he could not only mind his own business, but also teach the South African authorities to be smarter and "care about what is happening in other parts of the African continent." However, Verwoerd did not think he was that stupid. He argued that the South African federal government also followed Christian philosophy and stood on "the side of Western countries," and that what South Africa was doing was completely in line with the new development of Africa. Verwoerd revealed that his disagreement with Macmillan only lay in "how to win Africa" and "how to develop Africa so that it has the greatest value to the West."

	Indeed, Macmillan said that his policy was "non-racial," in order to establish a "national collective," which, in the words of the "Times," was a "national partnership." The Associated Press put it more bluntly: "Moderate whites woo moderate Africans and become a powerful force in African political life," which, when broken down, means trying every possible means to maintain the rule and exploitation of blacks. And Verwoerd's policy is much simpler: "We are white, but we are in Africa," "This gives us a special responsibility," that is, "to give the blacks among us a full future." The so-called "full future" is no less impressive than Macmillan's beautiful words such as "deep belief in the political destiny of free people." The Hola concentration camp set up by Britain in Kenya, the massacre carried out under the state of emergency in Nyasaland, and the insatiable plunder in Africa... are they more civilized than the racial segregation practiced by the South African Federation!

	Of course, it should be admitted that Macmillan, as the Prime Minister of the British Empire, is superior to Verwoerd, the Prime Minister of the autonomous territory, in every aspect. The British "Workers' Daily" editorial on February 4 put it well: "More far-sighted, cunning, and flexible than the South African racists, Macmillan and the Conservatives are trying to play tricks to maintain their power in Africa. They feel that like Verwoerd is trying to do, rigidly pressing down the lid may cause an explosion that completely drives the whites out of Africa, while a few safety valves may delay that day." This is what makes Macmillan superior to Verwoerd.

	However, reality is so ruthless that explosions are a historical necessity. From today's situation, efforts to delay the moment of this explosion seem to be in vain. Therefore, Macmillan could not help but be at a loss and rather sadly say that he would have to "think and digest" the "many things" he "saw and heard" in Africa after returning home.... Thinking more about the current situation in Africa is of great benefit to both Macmillan and Verwoerd.

    一丘之貉
    子悦
    六十年代的日历刚刚翻过几页，麦克米伦就匆忙地奔上了非洲的坎坷的旅程。他口口声声兜售的“亲善”和“多种族社会”的货色，并不吃香，在中非一路上饱受了浪潮般的示威抗议，甚至在一家旅馆出席宴会时，他还发见了一枚“硝酸干油制成的炸弹”。一直到了最末一段旅程的“在南非的一个白人国家”里，才惊魂初定。可是，偏偏大煞风景，想不到在忠于女王陛下的这个自治领里，居然还同自己的“朋友”发生了一场颇不愉快的争吵。
    麦克米伦2月3日在南非议会发表演说，大吹英国既“反对那种认为一个种族对另一个种族具有固有的优越性的观念”，又关怀“自由人的政治命运”，接着，他似乎颇为郑重地宣布：“英国不能支持南非的种族政策”。可是，这一来，南非总理维沃尔德可光火了，顾不得礼节，当场给麦克米伦下不了台。他在全体议员掌声中更为郑重地向麦克米伦宣告，“我不能同意你的一切声明”，并且警告他说：“一个人设法伤害与他有不同意见的人是不会有什么好处的。”关系一时闹得十分紧张，到了第二天，维沃尔德在大开国宴时，还觉得有必要使麦克米伦夫妇放心，首先声明：他这次所要说的将是恭维话了。
    维沃尔德反驳麦克米伦时，是认真其事的，从“政策”、“西方文明的观念”到“基督哲学”，几乎无不给尊贵的客人顶了回去。然而，真如俗话所说的那样，不打不成知己。经此一番吵闹，原来麦克米伦的“非种族主义”，同维沃尔德的种族主义之间，不过是像他们碰杯时所盛的不同颜色的两杯酒罢了。
    且不说南非盛行种族歧视和压迫是早在它作为英国殖民地的时代就已经开始的，而且麦克米伦自己也曾表明英国还要继续在联合国反对谴责南非的种族歧视政策，他还指责了对南非实行的抵制。更重要的是，英国在大于它本土二十倍以上的非洲殖民地实行的殖民统治，同英国当年在南非实行的殖民统治固无二致，同现在南非白人政府对黑人和其他有色人实行的统治，也无任何本质的差别。麦克米伦“访问”南北罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰时，就到处听到示威的非洲人民要求“自由”、“让我们摆脱白人统治”的愤怒呼声，使得这位“亲善”使者不能不处处防范，步履维艰。据路透社报道，麦克米伦在北罗得西亚利文斯敦的教堂里作晨祷时，保安警察增加一倍，凡进教堂的非洲人一律要受检查，非洲人拒绝检查，都走开了，但麦克米伦仍然胆战心惊地频频询问随从：“今天没有发现任何炸弹吗？”在这里，英国同中非黑人的关系，就一点也不比南非联邦政府同黑人的紧张关系缓和。这自然是因为大英帝国对殖民地人民实行种族压迫的结果。因此，如果麦克米伦不免要抱怨中非的非洲人如此缺乏“种族和谐”和“善意”的话，那末，维沃尔德也就完全有权利抱怨麦克米伦对南非种族歧视政策的批评太不“公道”了。
    麦克米伦在南非议会上不得不承认，他在非洲之行中“获得的最突出的印象是非洲民族觉悟的力量”，“变革之风正吹遍大陆”。因此，他认为，“我们的民族政策必须考虑到这一点”。但什么样的政策呢？原来是必须“使英联邦和自由世界的将来……建立在基督和自由社会的法制的基础上”，通俗一点，也就是必须挽救非洲殖民制度的崩溃。这样，真相就大白了，麦克米伦对南非的批评，是出于一片好意。他说，他不能只管自己的事，还要南非当局也学乖一些，“关心非洲大陆其他地方发生的事情”。但是，维沃尔德并不以为自己笨到那里，他争辩说，南非联邦政府也是遵从基督哲学，站在“西方国家这一边”，而且南非所作的事完全符合非洲的新发展。维沃尔德一语道破了他同麦克米伦不一致之处，只在于“如何赢得非洲”，“如何发展非洲使它对西方具有最大价值”上面。
    的确，麦克米伦说他的政策是“非种族的”，为了建立一种“民族集体”，用“泰晤士报”的说法是“民族合伙关系”，美联社更坦率一些的说法是“温和的白人拉拢温和的非洲人并成为非洲政治生活中的强大力量”，拆穿来就是千方百计地保持对黑人的统治和剥削。而维沃尔德的政策呢，干脆得多，“我们是白人，但是我们是在非洲”，“这使我们具有一种特别的责任”，即“给予我们之中的黑人以一种充分的前途”。所谓“充分的前途”云云，比起麦克米伦所谓“关于自由人的政治命运的深切信念”之类的美妙词汇来，一点也不逊色。英国在怯尼亚设立的霍拉集中营，在尼亚萨兰颁布紧急状态进行的大屠杀，在非洲的贪得无厌的掠夺……，难道比南非联邦实行的种族隔离文明一些么！
    当然，应该承认，麦克米伦作为大英帝国的首相，无论那一方面都要比维沃尔德这位自治领的总理高出一筹。英国“工人日报”2月4日社论说得好：“比起南非的种族主义者更有远见、更为狡猾和更为灵活的麦克米伦及保守党人，正试图玩弄手段保持他们在非洲的势力。他们觉得像维沃尔德所设法做的那样，死死地压住盖子，可能把引起白人完全赶出非洲的爆炸，而几个安全活门反而可能延缓那一天的到来。”这就是麦克米伦比维沃尔德高明之处。
    但是，现实却如此无情，爆炸是历史的必然，从今天的形势看来，延缓这种爆炸的时刻的努力，看来也是徒劳无功的。因此。麦克米伦不禁茫然而又相当凄然地说，他回国后还得好好“思考和消化”他在非洲“看到和听到的许多事情”……。多考虑考虑非洲目前的形势，无论对于麦克米伦和维沃尔德，都是大有好处的。
