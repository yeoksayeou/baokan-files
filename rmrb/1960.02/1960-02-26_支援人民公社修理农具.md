    Supporting People's Communes in Repairing Farm Tools
    The spring plowing and sowing work on the agricultural production front has begun. At present, a very important task for industry to support agriculture is to organize technical forces to help people's communes rush to repair agricultural machinery and tools.
    Recently, many factories and mining enterprises in various places have launched a vigorous mass movement to support agriculture. Some are "factory-commune tie-ups (factories and people's communes are linked together), dividing areas of responsibility and contracting to the end"; some are organizing service teams to go to the countryside to repair farm tools; and some are "sending out, as masters, inviting in, as apprentices." No matter what form it takes, it is full of comradely help and communist spirit of cooperation. Many factories and mining enterprises in Liaoning, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Gansu, Heilongjiang and other provinces and cities have generally adopted the form of factory-commune tie-ups and fixed cooperation to help the vast rural areas repair agricultural machinery and tools; 386 of the 412 people's communes in Liaoning Province have been linked with factories. These factories and mines also plan to spread technical experience, helping communes establish and develop their own industries in terms of manpower, equipment, and technology. In five special districts in Henan, including Luoyang and Nanyang, more than 19,000 technical service teams were organized, which repaired and assembled 5.51 million pieces of mechanical farm tools for the people's communes. Young workers in Shanghai organized 118 technical service teams during holidays, carrying toolboxes to suburban people's communes to repair agricultural machinery and tools. In more than two months, a total of more than 1,200 pieces of agricultural machinery and tools were repaired, and 87 technical experiences were imparted. All these activities not only effectively supported spring plowing, improved the level of agricultural technology, and boosted the political and production enthusiasm of the members of the people's communes, but also gave the workers a great education.
    Spring is the season for repairing and assembling farm tools and machinery. "A workman must first sharpen his tools if he wants to do his work well." With well-repaired farm tools and handy production tools, we can better cultivate the land carefully and improve labor productivity. This year's spring plowing and sowing is the beginning of the third consecutive year of leap forward in agricultural production in our country. The victory of spring plowing and sowing is related to the bumper harvest of agricultural production throughout the year, and also to the leap forward in industrial production. Therefore, repairing farm tools is not a trivial matter, but a major event that is directly related to the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.
    There is another important reason why this year's repair work of farm tools and machinery needs to be strengthened in particular. That is, in the past two years, the composition of farm tools in rural areas of our country has undergone considerable changes, with an increase in improved farm tools and agricultural machinery. These agricultural machines are burdened with heavy operational tasks, and in addition to some losses in agricultural production, there have also been some losses in water conservancy construction this winter and spring. With the increase of new agricultural machinery, the repair technology is much more complicated than in the past, and the repair tasks are also more arduous than in the past. In order to support agricultural production and ensure sufficient water for farmland, especially to fight against the current spring drought in some areas, factories in various cities should also seize the time to rush to repair various drainage and irrigation machinery, and strive to enable all drainage and irrigation machinery to play its greatest role in spring production. At present, the technical force in rural areas of our country is still very weak, and many personnel who use agricultural machinery have not fully mastered more complex skills. Therefore, many urgent repair tasks need to be supported by urban industrial and mining enterprises and the broad masses of workers. This is the glorious mission of the working class.
    Factory-commune tie-ups and technology going to the countryside are not only conducive to promoting agricultural technological transformation, but also conducive to the development of the factory enterprises themselves. It is a form of communist cooperation. Through cooperation, factory enterprises can make comprehensive and systematic plans to support agriculture, and plan to improve the technical level of industrial support for agriculture; through cooperation, they can understand the needs and changes of agriculture in a timely manner, so as to improve their own production; through cooperation, the broad masses of farmers can learn the spirit of selfless collectivism and the revolutionary style of daring to think and act from the workers, and the broad masses of workers can learn the fine tradition of hard work and simple living and soaring enthusiasm from the farmers, and practically understand the superiority of the people's communes and the construction prospects of the countryside, thereby deepening the friendship between workers and peasants and further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. It can be seen that the significance of factory-commune tie-ups and technology going to the countryside is by no means a general repair of farm tools, nor does it only have economic significance, but also has a significant political impact. If all large and small factories and mines across the country establish such a tied relationship with the people's communes, and can send service teams to the countryside at certain times to inspect and repair farm tools and disseminate technology; then, the pace of our agricultural technology transformation can be greatly accelerated.
    All the workers and staff on the industrial front, carry forward the class friendship and the communist spirit of cooperation, take on the task of supporting the leap forward in agriculture, produce more complete sets of farm tools, machinery and spare parts, cultivate sufficient technical strength, repair the farm tools and machinery urgently needed in the current spring plowing, and achieve joint leap forward between workers and peasants, and lay a good foundation for striving for a bumper harvest on the agricultural front this year.

    支援人民公社修理农具
    农业生产战线上的春耕春播工作开始了。当前，工业支援农业的一件十分重要工作，就是组织技术力量帮助人民公社赶修农械农具。
    近来各地许多厂矿企业展开了轰轰烈烈的支援农业的群众运动，有的是“厂社挂钩（工厂和人民公社挂起钩来）、分片包干、一包到底”；有的是组织服务队，下乡修农具；还有的“派出去、当师傅，请进来、做徒弟”。不论是什么样的形式，都充满了同志式的帮助和共产主义的协作精神。辽宁、江苏、上海、甘肃、黑龙江等省、市许多厂矿企业，普遍采取了厂社挂钩、固定协作的形式，帮助广大农村修理农具农械；辽宁全省四百一十二个人民公社中已有三百八十六个同工厂挂上了钩。这些厂矿还有计划地传播技术经验，从人力、设备、技术等方面，帮助公社建立和发展自己的工业。河南洛阳、南阳等五个专区，组织了一万九千多个技术服务队，到人民公社修配了机械农具五百五十一万件。上海市的青年工人曾经利用假日组织一百一十八个技术服务队，带着工具箱到郊区人民公社修理农具农械。两个多月内共修好农具农械一千二百多件，传授技术经验八十七项。所有这些活动，不仅有效地支援了春耕，提高了农业技术水平，鼓舞了人民公社社员的政治的生产的积极性，而且也给工人群众很大教育。
    春天，是农具农械的修配季节。“工欲善其事，必先利其器”。修配好了农具，生产工具得心应手，才可以更好地精耕细作，提高劳动生产率。今年的春耕春播，是我国农业生产第三个年头连续跃进的开端，春耕春播的胜利关系到全年农业生产的丰收，也关系到工业生产的跃进。因此，修理农具不是一件小事情，而是直接关系着工农业生产继续跃进的一件大事。
    今年农具农械的修理工作所以特别需要加强，还有一个重要情况。这就是在过去两年内，我国农村的农具构成有了相当大的变化，改良农具增加了，农业机械也增加了。这些农业机械担负着繁重的作业任务，除了在农业生产上有一些损耗以外，去冬今春水利建设中也有所损耗。随着新式农业机械的增加，修理技术比过去复杂得多，修理的任务也就比过去更加繁重了。为了支援农业生产保证农田有足够的用水，特别是同目前一些地区的春旱作斗争，各个城市工厂还应当抓紧突击修理各种排灌机械，争取全部排灌机械都能在春季生产中发挥最大的作用。目前，我国农村的技术力量还很薄弱，许多使用农业机械的人员还没有完全掌握比较复杂的技能。因此，许多迫切的修理任务需要由城市工矿企业和广大职工来支援，这是工人阶级的光荣使命。
    厂社挂钩、技术下乡，既有利于促进农业技术改造，也有利于工厂企业本身生产的发展，是共产主义大协作的一种方式。通过协作，工厂企业可以全面系统地作出支援农业的规划，有计划地提高工业支援农业的技术水平；通过协作，可以及时了解农业的需要及其变化，从而改进自己的生产；通过协作，广大农民可以从工人身上学到大公无私的集体主义精神和敢想敢干的革命风格，广大工人可以从农民身上学到艰苦朴素、干劲冲天的优良传统，实际了解人民公社的优越性和农村的建设远景，从而加深工农友谊，进一步巩固工农联盟。由此可见，厂社挂钩、技术下乡的意义决不是一般的修理农具，也不仅具有经济上的意义，而且有着重大的政治影响。如果全国各地所有大小厂矿都和人民公社建立起这样挂钩的关系，都能在一定时候派出服务队深入农村，检修农具，传播技术；那末，我们的农业技术改造的步伐就可以大大加快。
    工业战线上的全体职工们，发扬阶级友爱和共产主义的协作精神，担当起支援农业跃进的任务，生产更多的成套农具农械和配件，培养足够的技术力量，修配好当前春耕中急需的农具农械，做到工农携手，共同跃进，为争取今年农业战线的大丰收打下良好的基础。
