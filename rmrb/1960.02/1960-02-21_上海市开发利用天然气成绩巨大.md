Shanghai Achieves Great Success in Developing and Utilizing Natural Gas

The city has extracted more than 16 million cubic meters of natural gas, providing heat equivalent to more than 12,000 tons of gasoline. The uses of natural gas have expanded to more than 100 types. Rich experience has been accumulated, preparing conditions for future exploration and utilization of natural gas.

(Our Dispatch) Shanghai has achieved success in the exploitation and utilization of underground natural gas resources. In a little over a year, the city has extracted more than 16 million cubic meters of natural gas, providing heat equivalent to more than 12,000 tons of gasoline; the uses of natural gas have also expanded to more than 100 types. More importantly, rich experience has been accumulated during this period, preparing conditions for a larger scale exploration and utilization of natural gas in the future.

The natural gas currently extracted in Shanghai is shallow gas, which is stored in the Quaternary strata. There are multiple gas layers only a few meters to tens of meters below the ground. Since the city began organized exploitation in the fourth quarter of 1958, more than 2,000 effective gas wells have been drilled; the application of natural gas has gradually developed from daily life aspects such as cooking, lighting, boiling water, and heating. The city has started to use natural gas for quenching, welding, driving cars, producing carbon black, and manufacturing hydrocyanic acid; the suburbs and rural areas use it for power generation and driving internal combustion engines and agricultural machinery. Over the past year, an average of 38 buses in Shanghai have been running on natural gas every day; the Shanghai Bicycle Factory No. 3 has used natural gas to replace calcium carbide and has welded 32,000 bicycles. In Chuansha County in the suburbs, in addition to one-tenth of the farmers' canteens using natural gas for cooking, seven natural gas power stations have been established, generating 120 kilowatts of electricity; 599 horsepower internal combustion engines use natural gas as fuel to drive machines for rice milling, flour milling, cotton ginning, and irrigation.

The Communist Party committees at all levels in Shanghai have strongly led the city's natural gas exploitation and utilization. Shallow natural gas is buried shallowly, and gas seedlings often emerge from the ground. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, some units began to use the exposed gas seedlings for cooking and boiling water. After discovering this budding thing, the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee organized forces to conduct a general survey and exploration; on the one hand, it held on-site meetings to call on the masses to widely exploit it, and at the same time held exhibitions, report meetings, showed movies, published popular readers, and widely introduced common knowledge about the use of natural gas through radio and newspapers. Due to lack of experience, only a small number of units initially drilled wells to produce gas. Some people felt discouraged and doubted whether "taking fire from underground" could be realized. The Party committees at all levels adhered to putting politics in command, constantly encouraging the masses to break superstitions and try boldly. The Party secretaries of many units personally participated in drilling wells, and after drilling a gas well, they widely organized the masses to visit and inspire fighting spirit. According to the characteristics of shallow natural gas, which has a weak gas flow, is easy to exploit, and is widely distributed, the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee promptly put forward principles such as "large gas should be used for large purposes, small gas should be used for small purposes, use it as long as you can, drill one piece, then drill another piece," pointing out the correct direction for the city's natural gas exploitation and utilization work.

Because the Party committees at all levels relied on the masses to solve the difficulties and problems encountered in exploitation and utilization, and constantly accumulated experience, Shanghai has initially grasped the distribution of gas layers and geological characteristics within the scope of more than 5,900 square kilometers in the city in a short period of time, and the barrier of drilling wells has been basically overcome. In launching everyone to create well drilling methods, the city found more than 2,000 gas seedlings in a short period of time, and new creations continued to emerge in well drilling and gas production. People initially drilled wells by laboriously hammering iron pipes into the ground. Later, through gradual development, various manual hand drills, impact drills, hydraulic drills, and manual drills appeared. Using new tools for drilling not only greatly reduced the intensity of labor, but also greatly shortened the drilling time. In solving the problem of material sources, the masses used local materials, made do with whatever was available, and created equally rich and colorful solutions. The well pipes used here are made of bamboo and wood; the gas transmission pipes on the well are replaced with old rubber pipes, old glass pipes, and other various pipes. The groundwater level in Shanghai is high, and the gas wells often spray muddy water when they vent gas. People have used wine jars, wooden barrels, and oil tanks to manufacture simple water-gas separators. According to statistics from Chuansha County alone, the masses have made 58 major creations and reforms in the exploitation of natural gas.

While widely mobilizing the masses to engage in creation, the Shanghai Party organizations at all levels organized technical personnel to conduct scientific research on the spot in combination with practice, and assisted the masses in summarizing experience. The natural gas burners created by various units have their own advantages. After being sorted out by technical personnel, a relatively complete burner has now been manufactured.

Based on the practice of the past year or so, the development of natural gas in Shanghai has now entered a stage of large-scale exploitation and wider application. The city has formulated this year's exploitation and utilization plan, and a new upsurge in natural gas exploitation has begun from the urban area to the suburbs.

According to existing data, China is exceptionally rich in shallow natural gas reserves. The gas layers are distributed throughout the Quaternary strata in the coastal, riverside, and lakeside areas. A large number of shallow gas layers have also been found in older strata in other areas. Shanghai's experience in exploiting and utilizing shallow natural gas has been valued by various places, and 15 provinces (regions) and cities have recently sent representatives to Shanghai to visit and study.

    上海市开发利用天然气成绩巨大
    全市开采的天然气有一千六百多万立方米，提供的热量相当于一万二千多吨汽油，天然气的用途已扩大到一百多种，并积累了丰富经验，为今后开采利用天然气准备了条件
    本报讯　上海市开采和利用地下天然气资源已取得成就。在一年多时间里，全市开采的天然气已达一千六百多万立方米，提供的热量相当于一万二千多吨汽油；天然气的用途也扩大到一百多种。更重要的是，这一时期已积累丰富经验，为今后更大规模的开采和利用天然气准备了条件。
    上海目前开采的天然气是蕴藏在第四纪地层中的浅层气，离地面几米到几十米间就有多层气层。从1958年第四季度全市开始有组织的开采以来，已先后打出有效气井二千多口；天然气的应用也从烧饭、点灯、煮水、取暖等生活方面逐步发展，城市开始用天然气淬火、焊接、开汽车、造炭黑、制氰氢酸；郊区农村用来发电和开动内燃发动机和农业机械。一年多来，上海平均每天有三十八辆公共汽车用天然气行驶；上海自行车三厂用天然气代替电石，已焊制了三万二千辆自行车。郊区川沙县除了十分之一的农民食堂用天然气烧饭外，已建立天然气发电站七所，发电量达一百二十瓩；有五百九十九马力的内燃机用天然气作燃料带动机器碾米、磨粉、轧花、灌溉。
    中共上海各级党委一直有力地领导了全市天然气的开采和利用。浅层天然气因为埋藏浅，气苗常露出地面。1958年大跃进中，有的单位开始利用露出的气苗烧饭、煮水。上海市委发现这一萌芽事物后，一面组织力量进行普查、勘探；一面召开现场会议号召群众广泛开采，同时举办展览会、报告会、放映电影、出版通俗读本和通过电台、报纸广泛介绍有关利用天然气的常识。由于缺乏经验，许多单位初期打井出气的仅占少部分，有些人感到气馁，对“地下取火”能否实现发生怀疑。各级党委坚持政治挂帅，不断鼓励群众破除迷信，大胆尝试。不少单位的党委书记亲自参加打井，并在打出一口气井后，就广泛组织群众参观，鼓舞斗志。根据浅层天然气的气体流量较弱、易于开采、分布又广的特点，上海市委及时又提出“大气大用，小气小用，能用多久，就用多久，打了一片，再打一片”等原则，指出了全市天然气开采、利用工作的正确方向。
    由于各级党委依靠群众解决开采、利用中遇到的困难问题，不断积累经验，上海短时期内已初步掌握全市五千九百多平方公里范围内的气层分布情况和地质特点，打井这一关已基本闯过。在发动大家创造打井方法中，全市短时期内找到气苗二千多处，在打井采气上不断涌现出新的创造。人们最初打井只是吃力地用锤子把铁管敲打到地下，以后经过逐步发展，出现了各种人工手钻、冲击钻、水力和人工钻。用新工具钻井，不仅劳动强度减轻很多，打井时间也大大缩短。在解决材料来源问题上，群众就地取材，因陋就简，创造同样丰富多采。这里采用的井管有竹、木做的；井上的输气管用旧胶皮管、旧玻璃管以及其他各种各样管子代替。上海地下水位较高，气井喷气时往往带有泥水，人们又用酒坛、木桶、油箱制造简便的水气分离器。仅据川沙县统计，群众在开采天然气中较大的创造和改革就有五十八项。
    上海各级党组织在广泛发动群众从事创造的同时，组织技术人员到现场结合实际进行科学研究，并且协助群众总结经验。各单位创造的天然气的燃烧器各有优点，现经技术人员整理后，已制造出一种比较完善的燃烧器。
    在过去一年多实践的基础上，现在上海开发天然气工作已进入一个开采规模很大、应用范围更广的阶段。全市已制订出今年的开采利用规划，从市区到郊区一个开采天然气的新的高潮已经开始。
    据已有资料，我国浅层天然气蕴藏异常丰富，气层遍布沿海、沿江和滨湖地区的第四纪地层中，其他地区较老的地层也发现大量的浅气层。上海市开采、利用浅层天然气的经验已受到各地重视，有十五个省（区）、市最近派代表到上海参观、学习。　（徐寿铿）（附图片）
