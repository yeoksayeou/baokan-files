South of Hangzhou's West Lake, beyond several hills, lies the Longjing tea region, famous for its tea production. Here, dozens of miles of tea gardens and tea hills stretch, recently augmented by livestock pens scattered among the lush tea bushes. These are the pig farms built by the production teams of the Xihu Commune in the tea gardens.

What are the benefits of raising pigs in tea gardens? On February 21st, I visited the tea garden pig farm of the Longjing Production Team of the Xihu Commune with this question in mind.

The three pig farm workers, Zhou Hanzhang, Sheng Senting, and Qi Bangshou, are all young men. After I explained my purpose, they eagerly said that there are many benefits to raising pigs in the tea mountains! The first is that fertilizer no longer needs to be carried from the bottom of the mountain. Zhou Hanzhang calculated an account for me, saying that in the past, the more than 200 mu of tea gardens on Lion Peak Mountain required fertilizer to be carried up the mountain year-round, a journey of more than ten li up and down. A person could carry at most six loads a day. If each mu required 40 loads of fertilizer, it would take more than 1,300 laborers a year just to carry fertilizer. Now, carrying fertilizer from the pig farm on the top of the mountain to the tea gardens, one person can carry about 40 loads a day, saving more than 1,000 laborers a year. This is no small matter for tea production, which is highly seasonal and labor-intensive!

Raising pigs in the tea gardens allows for on-site production of stable manure and convenient topdressing. This not only saves a lot of labor transporting fertilizer up the mountain, but also ensures that the tea gardens receive more fertilizer of better quality, promoting increased tea production. Wang Jinyou, a cadre of the Longjing Production Team, told me that this year their entire team will have an even greater leap forward in tea production, and increasing fertilizer application is an important measure to ensure tea production. Therefore, the production team decided to develop tea garden pig farming to obtain the main source of fertilizer. The existing three tea garden pig farms will multiply the number of meat pigs raised. Raising pigs in tea gardens is also greatly beneficial for transforming backward gardens. In the past, tea gardens on the top of the mountain often suffered from low fertilizer application due to the difficulty of transporting fertilizer over long distances, and many became backward gardens. Now, these mountain-top tea gardens have become advantageously located. No wonder the increased production target on the experimental garden sign of the mountain-top tea garden cadres has doubled compared to last year.

In the gaps between the tea rows, the ground is full of green manure with newly grown tender leaves, which are fodder crops sown by the young men. In the room where pig feed is cooked, there are piles of chopped tender green feed. Where does the feed come from for raising pigs in tea gardens? "There is plenty of green fodder on the mountain, and firewood and water are convenient, saving labor and costs. There are many tender grasses and green manure in the tea fields that pigs love to eat raw and cooked," the young men replied to my question satisfactorily.

As I was about to leave the mountain-top pig farm, Zhou Hanzhang suddenly said to me: "Please come and see us again next month. We are going to install three aerial cableways, so fertilizer and feed can fly everywhere, and pig farming will also increase greatly."

On the way, I remembered what Wang Jinyou, the cadre of the production team, said: "To achieve a double leap forward in tea and livestock, putting pig pens on the mountain and raising pigs in tea gardens is a good method."

### 茶园养猪好处多

    茶园养猪好处多
    绕杭州西湖往南，越过几个山坡，便进入盛产名茶的龙井茶区。这里，蜿蜒着几十里的茶园茶山，新近增添了一座座畜舍，散布在葱绿茂密的茶蓬之间。那是西湖公社各生产队在茶园兴建的猪场。
    茶园养猪有些什么好处？2月21日，我带着这个问题，访问了西湖公社龙井生产队的茶园养猪场。
  养猪场三个饲养员周汉章、盛森庭、戚邦寿都是青年小伙子。我说明来意以后，他们争着说，茶山养猪的好处可多呢？头一件，肥料不用从山底下挑上山了。周汉章屈指算了一笔账给我听，过去狮峰山两百多亩茶园，一年四季都要从山下挑肥壅施，上下十里多路，一个人一天顶多挑六担。要是每亩以施肥四十担计算，一年光挑肥要花一千三百多个劳力。现在，从山顶养猪挑肥到茶园，一个人一天能挑四十担左右，一年就可节省劳力一千多个，对季节性强、劳力紧张的茶叶生产来说，这可不是一件小事！
    茶园养猪，就地制造厩肥，就地供应追施，十分方便。这不仅可以节省许多运肥上山的劳动力，而且还可以使茶园施肥量多质好，促使茶叶增产。龙井生产队干部王金有告诉我，今年他们全队茶叶生产要有一个更大跃进，增施肥料是保证茶叶生产的一项重要措施。因此，生产队决定发展茶园养猪来取得主要的肥料。现有的三个茶园猪场都将成倍增养肉猪。茶园养猪还大大有利于改造落后园。过去山顶的茶园往往因路远运肥难，年年施肥少，不少就成了落后园。现在，这些山顶茶园成了近水楼台了。难怪，山顶茶园干部试验园的木牌的增产指标比去年翻了一番。
    在茶缝间隙空地上，满是刚长出嫩叶的绿肥，那是小伙子们播下的饲料作物。在煮猪食的房间里，满堆着切碎的嫩绿的饲料。茶园养猪，饲料是哪里来的？“山上青饲料多，柴水方便，省劳力，省成本。茶地里许多嫩草、绿肥，猪爱生吃，也爱熟吃。”小伙子们很圆满地答复了我问的问题。
    当我要离开山顶猪场的时候，周汉章突然对我说：“下个月请你再来看看，我们要装上三架空中索道，肥料、饲料可以到处飞了，养猪也要大大增加了。”
    路上，我记起了生产队干部王金有说的话：要茶畜双跃进，猪栏上山、茶园养猪，是个好办法。
