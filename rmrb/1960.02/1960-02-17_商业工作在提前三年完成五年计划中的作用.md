As a result of the two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, the main indicators of China's Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy were completed two years ahead of schedule. This is a great victory achieved by the Chinese people under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. In the past two years, commercial work has also achieved a continuous Great Leap Forward in the overall Great Leap Forward of the national economy and has successfully completed the commercial work tasks stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan. The total retail sales of social commodities in 1959 reached 63.8 billion yuan, an increase of 34.5% compared with 1957, the last year of the First Five-Year Plan; in 1959, the total value of industrial and agricultural products purchased by the commercial department system increased by 107% compared with 1957; and the total domestic sales value increased by 89% compared with 1957. In the past two years, the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas has become more active, the market has become increasingly prosperous, and prices have remained stable. These situations reflect that China's commodity production is developing rapidly and commodity circulation is expanding rapidly.

    Commercial played a full "bridge" and "bond" role in the national economy
    In promoting the high-speed development of the national economy and striving to complete the main indicators of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, commercial work played an extremely important role. In the past two years, under the leadership of the Party and inspired by the General Line, the broad masses of commercial workers closely followed the pace of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, fully played the role of "bond" and "bridge", and went all out to organize commodity circulation and serve industrial and agricultural production, so that industrial and agricultural products entered the fields of circulation and consumption at the fastest speed, so as to continuously promote the rapid expansion of reproduction in industry and agriculture. Actively serve consumers, so that the market commodity supply and people's purchasing power are constantly maintained in balance, meet the growing needs of people's lives, thereby stabilizing market prices. The continued stability of market prices has strongly supported the high-speed progress of national economic construction.

    In serving industrial production and promoting the development of industrial production, commercial departments actively supplied various raw materials needed for industrial production. In addition to organizing the collection, purchase, and supply of various economic crop raw materials, various wild raw materials, and waste and old materials, they also gave full play to the characteristics of commercial departments in connecting various industries, vigorously organized the adjustment of raw materials and materials between industrial enterprises, and tried every means to meet the needs of industrial production for raw materials and materials. For all products produced by industrial departments, commercial departments purchased them all. Under the requirements of the plan, what is produced, what is purchased, how much is produced, how much is purchased. If industry completes the production plan ahead of schedule, commerce purchases ahead of schedule, and if industry overfulfills the production plan, commerce overfulfills the purchase plan. At the same time, we made every effort to organize and arrange the lives of employees, especially the commercial employees in the newly developed industrial, mining, and forestry areas. They put forward the slogan of "everything for the front line of production," such as the Tongjialiang Store in Datong, Shanxi, and the Shijingpo Store in Chongqing, with "everything for coal" and "everything for steel" as their work goals, and implemented it in all aspects, everyone, all the way to every employee's family. All the people in the industrial and mining area regard serving steel and coal production as their glorious task. Therefore, they achieved "wherever production goes, supply goes, whatever is needed, supply is provided, when it is needed, supply is provided." They also organized the families of employees to raise livestock and poultry, so that everyone understood the important significance of their labor and work for the completion of steel and coal production. Because commercial departments greatly strengthened their view of serving industry, they truly achieved "industry and commerce as one family", "with division of labor but no boundaries", and everything for the Great Leap Forward in production.

    In serving agricultural production, promoting the great development of agricultural production, and consolidating and developing people's communes, the first is to try every means to organize the supply of agricultural means of production and promote agricultural technological transformation. In the past two years, the total value of agricultural means of production such as chemical fertilizers, pesticides, agricultural machinery, and new agricultural tools organized by commercial departments is equivalent to the total value of supply during the First Five-Year Plan period. In addition, we also actively helped people's communes and production teams produce various local chemical fertilizers and local pesticides, and use local steel and local iron to produce various small agricultural tools, and held demonstrative small-scale industries to help communes train technical forces, so that commune industries and technical forces quickly grew stronger. At the same time, we vigorously purchased agricultural and sideline products produced by people's communes. Not only did we do more, faster, better, and more fully for important agricultural products, but we also purchased and utilized all usable small products. For example, the commercial department system purchased more than 800 million yuan of wild plant raw materials in 1959, more than three times more than in 1958, which is of great significance for consolidating people's communes. In addition, through holding various material exchange meetings and organizing rural market trade, the products that need to be exchanged between members and between production teams are exchanged in an organized manner under the leadership of the state to further activate the rural economy. Through this series of organizational work, commercial departments raised funds for agricultural production and agricultural technical equipment, added raw materials and materials for industrial production, increased income for communes and members, promoted the great development of agricultural production and diversified operations, and consolidated and developed people's communes.

    In terms of serving consumers, commercial departments not only improved the quality of service, but also actively organized people's economic life and tried every means to meet the growing needs of the people. People are the most fundamental factor in production activities. Sincerely serving consumers and meeting their living needs is an important condition for promoting high-speed development of production. After the rectification movement, the broad masses of commercial workers improved their political consciousness, overcame the "underestimation of commerce" mentality, and further recognized the important position and role of commercial work in the national economy. Therefore, after the Beijing Tianqiao Department Store proposed to innovate commercial work in 1958, a mass movement of "learning from Tianqiao and catching up with Tianqiao" was quickly launched throughout the country, greatly changing the face of commercial work. The broad masses of employees in the commercial and service industries carried forward the communist style of "giving convenience to customers and keeping difficulties to themselves," actively came up with ways to meet the requirements of customers as much as possible, so that customers came happily and left satisfied. Since 1959, under the unified leadership of the Party, commercial departments have deeply mobilized and relied on the broad masses to solve various problems in the lives of the masses. For example, rationally allocating commodities, running public canteens well, organizing neighborhood service centers, consignment stores, service stations, etc., made the masses feel very convenient, and also freed many people from housework. This work of organizing people's economic life is a further development of commercial work serving consumers, making commercial workers not only salespeople and service personnel, but also organizers of mass economic life.

    While promoting the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, commercial departments themselves have also achieved a Great Leap Forward in business management, greatly improved labor efficiency, accelerated capital turnover, reduced commodity circulation costs, and greatly increased capital accumulation. In 1959, compared with 1957, the capital turnover of the commercial department system accelerated by 0.26 times, and the commodity circulation cost level decreased by 2.63% (a decrease of 18%); the commercial accumulation in the two years of 1958 and 1959 accounted for 94% of the total commercial accumulation during the First Five-Year Plan period. In the past two years, the labor efficiency of the commercial system has also been greatly improved. In 1959, the total retail sales of social commodities increased by 34.5% compared with 1957, the total value of industrial and agricultural products purchased by the commercial department system increased by one time, and the total domestic sales value increased by 89%, while the number of commercial personnel (including social commercial employees) not only did not increase, but decreased slightly. In 1959, commercial departments launched a large-scale movement to increase production and practice economy, increasing production and saving more than 800 million yuan for the country. These also played a great role in promoting the high-speed development of national economic construction.

    The Leap Forward in commercial work is the result of adhering to political command and the mass line
    The continuous Great Leap Forward in commercial work is the result of adhering to the Party's General Line, adhering to the Party's leadership and political command, and adhering to the mass line. Since the Great Leap Forward, various commercial departments have more actively and consciously relied on the leadership of the Party committee, closely focusing on the central work of the Party in various periods, and carried out mass movements on a large scale, thus excellently completing the tasks of commerce itself. Commercial work must meet with the masses every day. It either deals with producers or with consumers. Without following the mass line and without relying on the strength of the broad masses, it is impossible to do commercial work well. The mass movement of commercial work must implement the principle of internal and external combination and common collaboration. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on the millions of employees in commercial departments to extensively and deeply carry out the "six good" (promoting production well, implementing policies well, completing plans well, managing business well, serving well, and advancing towards being red and expert) red flag movement, give full play to their enthusiasm and creativity, do a good job in purchasing and sales, and organize people's economic life well. At the same time, it is also necessary to rely on the strength of the broad masses of society to work together and do a good job in commercial work. In the work of purchasing agricultural products, rely on communes and production teams to carry out large-scale mass movements of concentrated purchasing and transfer; in the work of purchasing industrial products and supplying raw materials and materials, closely cooperate with industrial and handicraft departments to closely combine the mass movement of commercial departments with the mass movement of industrial departments; in organizing people's economic life, mobilize and rely on employees' families and social masses to rationally allocate commodities, organize and run various social service undertakings, and closely combine the mass movement of commercial departments with the broad mass movement of society. All of this is a good form of closely linking socialist commerce with the people, and is a concrete application of the Party's mass line working method in commercial work, which must continue to be implemented.

    In short, the reason why commercial work has been able to achieve continuous Great Leap Forward in the past two years is that commercial work has conscientiously implemented the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, is the result of strengthening the political viewpoint, that is, the production viewpoint and the mass viewpoint, relying on the leadership of the Party in work, adhering to political command, and conscientiously implementing the Party's mass line working method.

    New Tasks for Commercial Work in 1960
    1960 is a year of continued leap forward in China's national economy. Our commercial departments should actively and properly arrange commercial work in accordance with the requirements of national economic development in 1960. Further play the "bridge role" and "bond role" to promote the continued leap forward of the national economy.

    Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. From 1960, the technological transformation of agriculture will be accelerated, and the various means of production needed for agriculture will increase accordingly. Commercial departments should, according to this situation, conscientiously do a good job in the allocation and supply of agricultural means of production distributed by the national (central and local) plan, and do a good job in the supply of agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides to support agricultural production, consolidate people's communes, and gradually realize the modernization of agriculture. On the other hand, although the agricultural means of production distributed by the national plan have a relatively large increase, they are still insufficient compared with the needs of agricultural development. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to implement the two-legged walking policy of "combining foreign and local methods", "self-reliance as the main, and striving for foreign aid as auxiliary", and adopt the principle of "taking materials locally, producing locally, and supplying locally", and actively help people's communes run industries well, organize the production of fertilizers, pesticides, agricultural tools, and other agricultural means of production, and strive to fully meet the needs of agricultural production. In addition, due to the increase in large-scale agricultural machinery, technical strength and repair problems are becoming increasingly important. In addition to ensuring the supply of agricultural means of production while ensuring use and repair, commercial departments should also cooperate with industrial and handicraft departments to help communes train technical personnel and gradually establish a repair network to ensure that minor repairs do not leave the team and major repairs do not leave the commune, and give full play to the effectiveness of agricultural machinery.

    In order to ensure the continued leap forward in agricultural production and give full play to the role of agriculture in supporting industry, commercial departments should further do a good job in the purchase, processing, and transfer of agricultural and sideline products; and help people's communes solve some specific difficulties in developing production. In the work of purchasing agricultural and sideline products, the purchase of economic crops such as cotton, flax, and tobacco should draw on the successful experience of 1959 and always implement the method of grasping big, grasping early, and completing in one go. The collection and purchase of wild plants in the "small autumn harvest" should also draw on the experience of grasping the season, concentrating forces, and carrying out surprise attacks in 1959 to achieve more collection and more purchase. At the same time, we must also organize the processing and utilization of wild plants and everything else that can be used that have been collected and purchased.

    In order to implement the policy of taking pig raising as the center and vigorously developing animal husbandry, it is necessary to vigorously develop the pig raising industry in 1960. Commercial departments should vigorously support it, correctly implement the price policy according to the policy of developing animal husbandry production with public raising as the main and private raising as the auxiliary, do a good job in purchasing, processing, and supply, and help communes and production teams solve difficulties such as breeding pigs and epidemic prevention as much as possible to promote the great development of animal husbandry production.

    Supporting and promoting industrial production is another important task of commercial departments. Commercial departments must continue to strengthen industry-commerce collaboration and adhere to the policy of serving industrial production. Expand the source of industrial raw materials from all aspects. In addition to increasing the purchase of crop raw materials as much as possible, we must also find and open up new sources of raw materials in many ways, and make full use of all usable materials and "waste products".

    With the development of industrial production and capital construction, the supply tasks in industrial and mining areas are also becoming increasingly heavy. Strengthening and doing a good job in the supply work in these areas and ensuring the living needs of the broad masses of employees, especially the supply of commodities specially needed by workers, is of great importance for ensuring the realization of the main indicators of steel, coal, petroleum, etc. in the national economy and promoting the high-speed development of heavy industry production.

    In addition to industrial, mining, and forestry areas, it is also necessary to do a good job in the supply of daily-use industrial products and non-staple foods in cities and rural areas, and organize people's economic life well. With the great development of agricultural production and the rapid growth of rural purchasing power, as well as the further development of light industrial production, there will also be a relatively large increase in the supply of light industrial products to rural areas. Commercial departments must do a good job in the rational distribution, allocation, and supply of daily-use industrial products. All daily-use industrial products suitable for rural needs should be given priority to supply to rural areas to meet the needs of the broad masses of farmers and support the purchase of agricultural products. In the production and supply of non-staple foods, on the one hand, we should continue to implement the policy of "self-reliance as the main, and striving for foreign aid as auxiliary" in cities and industrial, mining, and forestry areas; on the other hand, the broad masses of rural areas should also actively support cities and industrial, mining, and forestry areas on the basis of vigorously developing non-staple food production and greatly developing animal husbandry.

    In addition, commerce should continue to implement the spirit of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, conscientiously strengthen economic accounting, rationally use funds, vigorously improve business management, reduce commodity circulation costs, and accumulate more construction funds for the country. At the same time, we must continue to carry out large-scale mass movements of technical innovation and technical revolution, thereby greatly improving labor efficiency and reducing the labor intensity of employees. Continue to adhere to political command and carry out mass movements on a large scale, mobilize all positive factors, and give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of employees, so as to better play the role that commercial work should play in the development of the national economy and promote the high-speed development of the national economy.

    商业工作在提前三年完成五年计划中的作用
    商业部副部长　曾传六
    经过1958年和1959年两年的连续大跃进，我国发展国民经济第二个五年计划的主要指标在两年内提前完成了。这是我国人民在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下取得的伟大胜利。两年来，在整个国民经济大跃进中，商业工作同样获得了连续大跃进，也胜利地完成了第二个五年计划规定的商业工作任务。1959年社会商品零售总额达六百三十八亿元，比第一个五年计划最后一年，即1957年增长了34．5％；1959年商业部系统收购的工农业产品总值比1957年增长了107％；国内销售总值比1957年增长89％。两年来，城乡物资交流进一步活跃，市场日益繁荣，物价稳定。这些情况，反映了两年来我国商品生产正在飞跃发展，商品流通不断迅速地扩大。
    商业在国民经济中充分发挥了“桥梁”和“纽带”作用
    在促进国民经济高速度的发展，争取提前三年完成第二个五年计划主要指标的战斗任务中，商业工作起了极为重要的作用，两年来广大商业职工，在党的领导下，在总路线的鼓舞下，紧紧地跟上了工农业生产大跃进的步伐，充分地发挥了“纽带”和“桥梁”作用，全力组织商品流通、为工农业生产服务，使工农业产品以最快的速度进入流通和消费领域，以不断促进工农业迅速扩大再生产。积极为消费者服务，使市场商品供应与人民购买力之间经常地保持了平衡，满足了人民生活日益增长的需要，从而稳定了市场物价。而市场物价的持续稳定，又有力地支持了国家经济建设高速度进行。
    在为工业生产服务，促进工业生产发展方面，商业部门积极供应工业生产需要的各种原料。除组织各种经济作物原料以及各种野生原料和废旧物资的采集、收购和供应外，还发挥商业部门联系各行各业的特点，大力组织工业企业之间进行原料、材料的调剂，千方百计地满足工业生产对原料、材料的需要。对于凡是工业部门生产出来的产品，商业部门全部收购下来，在计划的要求下，生产什么、收购什么、生产多少、收购多少，工业提前完成生产计划，商业就提前收购，工业超计划生产，商业就超计划收购。与此同时，并全力组织安排好职工的生活，特别是在新发展起来的工矿林区的商业职工，他们提出了“一切为了生产第一线”的口号，如山西大同同家梁商店和重庆石井坡商店，以“一切为了炭”，“一切为了钢”作为自己工作的努力目标，并把它贯彻到各个方面，每一个人，一直到每个职工家属中去。使工矿区所有的人都把为钢铁、煤炭生产服务作为自己的光荣任。，因而做到了“生产到哪里，供应到哪里，需要什么，供应什么，什么时候需要，什么时候供应。”他们还把职工家属组织起来饲养家畜家禽、使他们每个人都了解自己劳动、工作，对完成钢、煤生产的重要意义。由于商业部门大大加强了为工业服务的观点，因而真正做到了“工商一家”、“有分工而无界限”，一切为了生产大跃进。
    在为农业生产服务，促进农业生产大发展，巩固和发展人民公社方面，首先是千方百计地组织农业生产资料的供应，促进农业技术改造。两年来，商业部门组织化学肥料、农药、农业机械和新式农具等生产资料的供应总值，相当于第一个五年计划期间的供应总值。此外还积极帮助人民公社、生产队生产各种土化肥、土农药，利用土钢土铁生产各种小农具，并举办示范性小型工业，帮助公社培训技术力量，使公社工业和技术力量很快壮大起来。同时对于人民公社生产的农副产品，进行大力收购，不但对重要的农产品做到多收、快收、收好、收足，而且把一切可以利用的小宗的产品，也全部收购和利用起来。如1959年商业部系统收购的野生植物原料达八亿多元，比1958年增加三倍多，这对巩固人民公社有着重要意义。另外，通过召开各种物资交流会，组织农村集市贸易，使社员与社员之间、生产队与生产队之间需要交换的产品，在国家领导之下进行有组织地交流，以进一步活跃农村经济。商业部门通过这一系列的组织工作，为农业生产和农业技术装备筹集资金，为工业生产增添原料、材料，为公社和社员增加收入，促进农业生产和多种经营的大发展，巩固和发展了人民公社。
    在为消费者服务方面，商业部门不仅提高了服务的质量，而且积极组织人民经济生活，千方百计地满足人民日益增长的需要。人，是生产活动中最根本的因素。真诚地为消费者服务，满足他们生活的需要，是促进生产高速度发展的一个重要的条件。经过整风运动，广大商业工作者提高了政治觉悟，克服了“轻商”思想，进一步认识了商业工作在国民经济中的重要地位和作用。因此，在1958年北京天桥百货商场提出革新商业工作的倡议以后，在全国范围内迅速地展开了一个“学天桥、赶天桥”的群众运动，大大地改变了商业工作的面貌。广大商业和服务行业的职工，发扬了“把方便送给顾客，把困难留给自己”的共产主义风格，积极想办法，尽可能地满足顾客的要求，使顾客高兴而来，满意而去。1959年以来，商业部门在党的统一领导下，深入发动和依靠广大群众，解决群众生活中的各项问题。例如，合理分配商品，办好公共食堂、组织邻里服务所、代销店、服务站等，使群众感到十分方便，同时也使很多人从家务劳动中解放出来。这种组织人民经济生活的工作，是商业工作为消费者服务的进一步发展，使商业工作人员不仅是售货员、服务员、而且成为群众经济生活的组织者。
    在促进工农业生产大跃进的同时，商业部门本身在经营管理方面，也获得了大跃进，劳动效率大大提高，资金周转加快，商品流转费用降低，资金积累也有了很大的增加。1959年比1957年，商业部系统资金周转加速零点二六次，商品流转费用水平降低2．63％（降低幅度为18％）；1958年和1959年两年中的商业积累，为第一个五年计划期间商业积累总值的94％。两年来商业系统的劳动效率也有很大提高，1959年比1957年社会商品零售总额增长了34．5％，商业部系统收购的工农业产品总值增长了一倍，国内销售总值增长89％，而商业人员（包括社会商业从业人员）不但没有增加，反而有所减少。1959年商业部门开展了大规模的增产节约运动，为国家增产节约八亿元以上。这些，对促进国民经济建设的高速度发展，也起了很大的作用。
    商业工作的跃进是坚持政治挂帅和群众路线的结果
    商业工作的连续大跃进，是由于坚持党的总路线，坚持党的领导和政治挂帅，坚持群众路线的结果。大跃进以来，由于各级商业部门更加主动和自觉地依靠党委的领导，紧紧围绕党的各个时期的中心工作，大搞群众运动，因而出色的完成了商业本身的任务。商业工作要天天与群众见面。不是与生产者打交道，就是与消费者打交道，不走群众路线，不依靠广大群众的力量，就不可能作好商业工作。商业工作的群众运动，必须实行内外结合、共同协作的原则。因此必须依靠商业部门的几百万职工，广泛深入地开展“六好”（促进生产好，执行政策好，完成计划好，经营管理好，服务质量好，向红专进军好）红旗运动，充分发挥他们的积极性和创造性，做好购销工作和组织好人民经济生活。同时，还要依靠社会广大群众的力量，共同协作，做好商业工作。在农产品收购工作中，依靠公社和生产队，开展大规模的突击收购和调运的群众运动；在收购工业产品和供应原料、材料工作中，密切与工业、手工业部门的协作，使商业部门的群众运动与工业部门的群众运动密切结合起来；在组织人民经济生活中，发动、依靠了职工家属和社会群众合理分配商品，组织和举办各种社会服务事业，把商业部门的群众运动同社会的广大群众运动密切结合起来。这一切，都是密切社会主义商业与人民群众之间联系的一种良好的形式，是党的群众路线的工作方法在商业工作中的具体运用，必须继续加以贯彻。
    总之，两年来，商业工作所以能连续大跃进，是商业工作认真贯彻执行党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的结果，是加强了政治观点、也就是生产观点和群众观点，在工作中依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，认真执行党的群众路线的工作方法的结果。
    1960年商业工作的新任务
    1960年是我国国民经济继续跃进的一年，我们商业部门应当按照1960年国民经济发展的要求，积极妥善地安排商业工作。进一步发挥“桥梁作用”和“纽带作用”，以促进国民经济的继续跃进。
    农业是国民经济基础。从1960年起将加速农业技术改造，农业需要的各种生产资料将随之增加，商业部门要根据这一情况，切实做好国家（中央与地方）计划分配的农业生产资料的调拨供应工作，做好农业机械、化肥和农药的供应工作，以支援农业生产，巩固人民公社，逐步实现农业的现代化。另方面，国家计划分配的农业生产资料虽然有较大的增长，但与农业发展的需要比较起来，仍然是不足的。因此要继续贯彻“洋土并举”、“自力更生为主，力争外援为辅”的两条腿走路的方针，采取“就地取材、就地生产、就地供应”的原则，积极帮助人民公社办好工业、组织肥料、农药、农具及其他农业生产资料的生产，力争充分满足农业生产的需要。此外，由于大型农业机械的增加，技术力量和修配问题日益重要。商业部门除了保证农业生产资料供应的同时作到保用、保修外，还应当协同工业、手工业部门，帮助公社培训技术人员，逐步建立起一个修配网，做到小修不出队，大修不出社，充分发挥农业机械的效能。
    为了保证农业生产的继续跃进，充分发挥农业支援工业的作用，商业部门要进一步做好农副产品的收购、加工和调运工作；并帮助人民公社解决发展生产中的一些具体困难。在农副产品收购工作中，对棉、麻、烟等经济作物的收购，应当吸取1959年的成功经验，始终贯彻大抓、早抓、一气呵成的方法。对“小秋收”的野生植物采集收购，也要吸取1959年抓住季节、集中力量，进行突击的经验，做到采集得多，收购得多。同时，还要做到把已经采集和收购起来的野生植物以及其他一切可以利用的东西，组织加工和利用。
    为了贯彻以养猪为中心，大力发展畜牧业的方针，在1960年要大力发展养猪事业，商业部门应当大力加以支持，根据公养为主，私养为辅的发展畜牧业生产的方针，正确执行价格政策，做好收购、加工、供应等工作，并尽可能帮助公社和生产队妥善解决种猪、防疫等困难，以促进畜牧业生产的大发展。
    支援和促进工业生产，是商业部门另外一个重要任务。商业部门必须继续加强工商协作，坚持为工业生产服务方针。从各方面扩大工业原料来源。除了尽量增加农作物原料的收购外，还要多方寻找和开辟新的原料来源，把一切可以利用的物资和“废品”，都充分利用起来。
    随着工业生产和基本建设的发展，工矿区的供应任务也日益繁重，加强和做好这些地区的供应工作，保证广大职工的生活需要，特别是工人特殊需要商品的供应，对保证国民经济中钢、煤、石油等主要指标的实现，促进重工业生产高速度发展，有着十分重要的意义。
    除了工矿林区以外，在城市和农村同样要作好日用工业品和副食品的供应工作，组织好人民经济生活。农业生产的大发展和农村购买力的迅速增长，以及轻工业生产的进一步发展，供应农村的轻工业品也将有较大的增加。商业部门必须做好日用工业品的合理分配、调拨供应工作。凡是适合农村需要的日用工业品，应该优先供应农村，以满足广大农民的需要和支持农产品的收购。在副食品的生产和供应上，一方面应该在城市和工矿林区继续贯彻“自力更生为主，力争外援为辅”的方针；另一方面，广大农村也要在大搞副食品生产，大大发展畜牧业的基础上，积极支援城市和工矿林区。
    此外，商业还应当继续贯彻勤俭办企业的精神，认真加强经济核算，合理使用资金，大力改善经营管理，降低商品流转费用，为国家积累更多的建设资金。同时要继续大规模地开展技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，从而大大提高劳动效率和减轻职工劳动强度。继续坚持政治挂帅大搞群众运动，把一切积极因素都调动起来，把广大职工的积极性和创造性发挥出来，以便更好地发挥商业工作在国民经济发展中应有的作用，促进国民经济高速度的向前发展。
