Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th - Soviet Doctor of Geography, Somov, said today that the ice and snow-covered Antarctica, like other continents on Earth, contains a large number of minerals.

He said that it is estimated that in the eastern Antarctic region there may be large amounts of gold, uranium, diamonds, beryllium, and iron ore; while in the western region there may be large amounts of lead, tin, steel, and gold. Coal mines have recently been discovered in eastern Antarctica.

Somov published an article in "Izvestia." He said that the practical use of Antarctica has been put on the agenda.

Somov pointed out that in recent years, Soviet scientists have made many achievements in the study of Antarctica. How much ice is there in Antarctica, and how much water is stored? This is an important question. The conclusion now is that the total storage of fresh water in the Antarctic region is nine times more than the total amount of fresh water in all the rivers and lakes in the world. If the ice in Antarctica completely melts, the horizontal level of the world's oceans may rise by fifty meters.

He also pointed out that whether the ice in Antarctica is increasing or decreasing, and whether the Antarctic ice area is expanding or shrinking, is also an important issue under study. Somov said that the materials from continuous photography over the Soviet research station "Mirny" prove that an average of 50,000 cubic meters of ice flows away every year in a zone of six hundred kilometers long. He said that the gradual melting of Antarctic ice is still continuing. In the past 50 years, the horizontal level of the world's oceans has risen by six centimeters, which is related to the melting of Antarctic ice.

Somov also said that Soviet scientists have recently overturned a previously believed theory that, due to the strong westerly winds blocking the Antarctic region in the southern latitudes, Antarctica does not have any impact on the meteorological processes in the Southern Hemisphere. However, it is now proven that Antarctica plays an important role in the meteorological processes in the Southern Hemisphere.

    冰雪南极宝藏多
    苏联科学家说，实际利用南极的问题已经提到日程上来了
    新华社莫斯科29日电　苏联地理学博士索莫夫今天说，冰雪复盖的南极，像地球上其他大陆一样，蕴藏有大量的矿藏。
    他说，据估计，在南极东部地区可能有大量金矿、铀矿、金刚石、铍和铁矿；而在西部地区则可能有大量铅、锡、钢、金。最近在南极东部地区已经发现了煤矿。
    索莫夫在“消息报”发表了一篇文章。他说，实际利用南极的问题已经提到日程上来了。
    索莫夫指出，近年来苏联科学家在研究南极方面取得了许多成就。南极到底有多少冰块、蕴藏有多少水量这是一个重要的问题。现在得出的结论是：在南极区淡水的总藏量比世界上所有河湖的淡水总量还多九倍。如果南极的冰完全融化，那么，世界海洋的水平面则可能提高五十米。
    他又指出，南极的冰块是在增多还是减少、南极冰区是在扩大还是在缩小——这也是研究中的一个重要问题。索莫夫说，苏联科学家在考察站“和平村”上空连续摄影的材料证明，在一条长达六百公里的地带，每年平均有五万立方米的冰块流走。他说，南极冰块逐渐融化的过程目前仍在继续着。最近五十年来，世界海洋的水平已提高了六厘米，这与南极冰块的融化有关。
    索莫夫还说，苏联科学家最近推翻了一种从前认为正确的理论，这种理论说，由于南纬度上空强大的西风封锁住了南极地区，所以南极对于南半球的气象过程不起任何影响。但是，现在证明，南极在南半球的气象过程中起着重要的作用。
