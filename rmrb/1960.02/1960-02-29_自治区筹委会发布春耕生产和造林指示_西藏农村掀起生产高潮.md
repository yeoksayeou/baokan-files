Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, February 28th: The Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region issued instructions on February 26 regarding spring plowing and launching a spring afforestation campaign. The instructions called on the people's governments at all levels in cities, special districts, and counties under the jurisdiction of Tibet to seize the opportunity, vigorously promote preparatory work for plowing, vigorously implement measures to increase production, muster all their energy, and vigorously launch mass movements to ensure a comprehensive victory in spring plowing and lay the foundation for overfulfilling this year's agricultural production plan. At the same time, without delaying agricultural production, launch a mass spring afforestation campaign focusing on greening villages and roadsides.

These instructions were adopted at the 30th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region held on February 26. Acting Chairman Panchen Erdeni presided over the meeting.

After democratic reform in the agricultural areas of Tibet, the feudal serf system has been completely destroyed. A large number of peasant activists have emerged, a large number of grassroots cadres have been trained, farmer and herdsman associations have been established, rural productive forces have been liberated, the mental outlook of the broad masses of working people has undergone fundamental changes, and their enthusiasm for production and organization has soared to unprecedented heights. A high tide of production centered on agriculture has been launched throughout the region, and the vast rural areas have presented a magnificent and vigorous leap forward situation.
