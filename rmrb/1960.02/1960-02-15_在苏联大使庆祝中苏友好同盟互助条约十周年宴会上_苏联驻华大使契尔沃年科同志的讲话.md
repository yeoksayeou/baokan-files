    At the Soviet Ambassador's Reception Celebrating the Tenth Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance
    Speech by Soviet Ambassador to China Comrade Chervonenko
    Dear Comrade Liu Shaoqi! Dear Comrades and Friends! Ladies and Gentlemen!
    Today we are gathered here at the Soviet Embassy to solemnly celebrate the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on February 14, 1950.
    Please allow me to extend a warm welcome to the representatives of the fraternal Chinese people, the representatives of the countries of the socialist camp, and all the distinguished guests attending our reception today!
    The Sino-Soviet Treaty legally affirmed the long-standing friendship between our two great peoples that has been forged throughout history. After the Great October Revolution and the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples became even more sincere and intimate. Between our two countries, on the basis of the same type of political system, namely, the people holding power, and on the basis of the unified Marxist-Leninist ideology, that is, the two peoples are united for the great and noble goal of building a communist society, a new relationship in nature has been established.
    The Sino-Soviet Treaty, rightly called by Comrade Mao Zedong "the great alliance of two great socialist countries," is filled in every clause with profound humanistic Leninist principles, namely, equality, mutual respect for national interests, fraternal selfless mutual assistance, non-interference in internal affairs, and unwavering loyalty to the cause of proletarian internationalism. This treaty is the most important milestone in the development path of two great socialist countries.
    If measured by the scale of history, ten years is not a long period, but the events that have occurred during this period and the victories achieved by the Chinese and Soviet peoples have amazed the world and have also brilliantly confirmed the undeniable superiority of the new socio-political system—socialism.
    When the Soviet Union embarked on the implementation of the first few five-year plans, there were many doubts and slanders in the bourgeois world. The situation was similar when the Chinese people, having shaken off the shackles of domestic feudal lords and foreign imperialists, began to build a new life. But objective reality did not fulfill the wishes of the enemies and muddle-headed doubters.
    The Soviet people, the working people of the entire socialist camp, and all honest people in the world are sincerely happy and proud of your achievements, our dear Chinese friends, and wish the great and talented Chinese people new and even more magnificent victories on the bright and lofty road of building socialism under the leadership of the beloved, long-tested, and powerful Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong.
    The past decade has also been of great significance to the Soviet Union, and its achievements during this time have been recognized worldwide as epoch-making. The historic 20th and 21st Congresses of the CPSU were convened, at which not only were further theoretical developments and concretizations made to Marxist-Leninist doctrines on socialism and communism, but also broad prospects were formulated for the practical realization of the transition from socialism to communism, which is reflected in the fifteen-year program for building the material and technical foundation of communism, of which the seven-year plan is an integral part. Today we can confidently say that our people are successfully implementing this program, and the time is not far off when the Soviet Union's special express train to communism will catch up with the largest and most important capitalist country—the United States—and leave the United States, along with the much-touted so-called American way of life, behind.
    The past decade has convincingly shown that Sino-Soviet friendship is of great significance for consolidating and further developing the entire socialist system and for the cause of peace and the security of all mankind.
    Every day we receive good news of the outstanding achievements of the peoples of the socialist camp in economic and cultural construction. The national economies of Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Albania, Korea, Vietnam, and Mongolia are developing smoothly and exceeding their original targets.
    It is no exaggeration to say that the unbreakable alliance of our two peoples, who are building socialism and communism, has become a decisive factor in the development of world history and a model of new and truly fraternal relations between the peoples of all countries.
    As Comrade N.S. Khrushchev said: "Our people have embarked on a broad and bright road, and we are full of boundless energy. For the billion people who have already cast off the yoke of capitalist enslavement, there is no task that they cannot accomplish. We are heading towards our sacred goal, firmly convinced of the righteousness of our common cause, and closely united into a unified team. This unity, illuminated by the never-extinguished brilliance of Marxism-Leninism, is our great achievement, and we will protect this achievement as we protect the pupils of our eyes."
    Socialism and peace are inseparable, and the principle of peaceful coexistence, which serves as the general line of the socialist camp's foreign policy, is determined by the essence of socialist society. The spirit of this principle is also the basis of the declaration of the Warsaw Treaty member states signed in Moscow not long ago.
    The rapid growth of the economic power of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries, their further unity, and the increase in the activity of their foreign policies aimed at consolidating peace have led to a relaxation of international tensions. Today we are pleased to point out that the balance of world forces is increasingly changing in favor of socialism, in favor of the peoples and countries that advocate peaceful coexistence between countries with different social and national systems and different ideologies.
    Dear friends, this is a great achievement for peace-loving peoples of all countries. But further efforts must be made to completely melt the ice of the "cold war" and prevent any despicable conspiracies by the imperialists.
    There is no doubt that the great Chinese and Soviet peoples will continue to strengthen our friendship unremittingly in the future, regarding this as their sacred duty and their highest internationalist responsibility, will closely unite with the peoples of the socialist camp, and will advance along the bright path pointed out by the great Lenin—the path of peace and friendship between the peoples of all countries.
    Long live the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance!
    Long live the great Chinese people!
    May the strong unity and close solidarity of the peoples of the socialist camp last forever!
    Long live world peace!
    Comrades! Friends!
    Please allow me to propose a toast: to the leaders of the Communist Party of China and the Government of the People's Republic of China:
    To Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,
    To Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China,
    To Comrade Zhu De, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress,
    To Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China!
    To the health of all the Chinese comrades present!
    To the health of all the guests!

    在苏联大使庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约十周年宴会上
    苏联驻华大使契尔沃年科同志的讲话亲爱的刘少奇同志！亲爱的同志们和朋友们！女士们和先生们！
    今天我们在这里，在苏联大使馆聚会，来隆重地庆祝中华人民共和国和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟在1950年2月14日签订的友好同盟互助条约的第一个十周年。
    请允许我向在座的兄弟中国人民的代表，社会主义阵营各国的代表和所有参加我们今天招待会的尊敬的来宾表示热烈的欢迎！
    苏中条约以法律的形式固定了我们两国伟大人民在历史上形成的悠久的友谊。在伟大的十月革命和中国人民革命胜利之后，中苏两国人民的友谊更特别诚挚和亲密起来。我们两国之间在同一类型的政治制度基础上，即人民掌握政权，在统一的马克思列宁主义思想的基础上，即两国人民都为一个伟大而崇高的建设共产主义社会的目标所团结起来，建立了性质上崭新的关系。
    苏中条约为毛泽东同志正确地叫作“两个伟大的社会主义国家的伟大同盟”，它的每一个条款中都充满了深刻的人道的列宁主义原则，即平等，互相尊重民族利益，兄弟的无私的互助，互不干涉内政，对无产阶级国际主义事业不可动摇的忠诚。这个条约是两个伟大的社会主义国家发展道路上的最重要的里程碑。
    如果用历史的尺度来衡量，十年是一个不长的时期，但是在这个时期里发生的事件和中苏两国人民所取得的胜利使全世界都感到钦佩，同时也辉煌地证实了新的社会政治制度——社会主义的无可争辩的优越性。
    当苏联着手实现头几个五年计划的时候，在资产阶级世界里有过许多的怀疑和污蔑。当中国人民摆脱了国内封建主和外国帝国主义者的桎梏开始建设新生活的时候，情况也是这样。但是客观的现实并没有让敌人和头脑糊涂的怀疑分子如愿以偿。
    苏联人民、整个社会主义阵营的劳动人民以及全世界正直的人们都同你们，我们亲爱的中国朋友们，一道为你们的成就感到由衷的高兴和骄傲，并且祝伟大的天才的中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的亲爱的、久经考验的、强大的共产党领导下在建设社会主义的光辉崇高的道路上取得新的、更加宏伟的胜利。
    过去的十年对苏联来说也是具有重大意义的，它在这个时间所取得的成就被全世界认为是划时代的。召开了具有历史意义的苏共第二十次和第二十一次代表大会，在这两次大会上不仅对马列主义关于社会主义和共产主义的学说作了进一步的理论上的发展和具体化，并且还为从社会主义过渡到共产主义的实际实现制定了广阔的远景，这一点反映在建立共产主义物质技术基础的十五年纲领中，七年计划就是这个纲领的一个组成部分。今天我们可以满怀信心地说，我国人民正在顺利地执行这个纲领，苏联共产主义的特别快车赶上最大的首要的资本主义国家——美国，并且把美国连同大肆吹嘘的所谓美国生活方式抛在后面的时候就不远了。
    过去的十年，令人信服地显示出，苏中友好对于巩固和进一步发展整个社会主义体系，对于和平和全人类安全事业是有巨大意义的。
    每一天都给我们传来社会主义阵营各国人民在经济和文化建设方面获得卓越成就的捷报。波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、朝鲜、越南和蒙古的国民经济得到顺利发展，并且超过原定的指标。
    如果我们说，正在建设社会主义和共产主义的我们两国人民的牢不可破的同盟已经成了世界历史发展的决定性的因素，成了各国人民之间新的真正兄弟关系的典范，这是毫不夸大的。
    正像尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志所说的：“我们的人民走上了广阔和光明的大道，我们充满着无穷的精力。对于已经抛弃资本主义奴役枷锁的十亿人民来说，没有什么任务是他们所不能胜任的。我们走向自己神圣的目标，深信我们共同事业的正义性，紧密地团结成一支统一的队伍。在马克思列宁主义永不熄灭的光辉照耀下的这种团结是我们的伟大成果，我们将像保护眼珠一样地保护这个成果。”
    社会主义和和平是分不开的，作为社会主义阵营的对外政策总方针的和平共处原则是由社会主义社会的本质所决定的。这一原则的精神也是不久前在莫斯科所签订的华沙条约缔约国宣言的基础。
    苏联、中华人民共和国和其它社会主义国家经济威力的飞速增长，它们之间的进一步团结，它们的旨在巩固和平的对外政策的积极性的增加导致了国际紧张局势的缓和。今天我们高兴地指出，世界力量的对比越来越变化得有利于社会主义，有利于主张不同社会和国家制度以及不同意识形态各国和平共处的各国人民和国家。
    亲爱的朋友们，这是爱好和平的各国人民的一个很大的成果。但是还必需再接再厉来彻底溶化“冷战”的冰块，和防止帝国主义者任何卑鄙的阴谋。
    毫无疑问，伟大的中苏两国人民，今后仍将不懈地加强我们的友谊，并认为这是他们的神圣义务和他们最高的国际主义职责，将同社会主义阵营各国人民紧密地团结一致，沿着伟大列宁所指出的光辉道路——全世界各国人民之间和平友好的道路前进。
    苏中友好同盟互助条约万岁！
    伟大的中国人民万岁！
    祝社会主义阵营各国人民坚强的一致和紧密的团结万古长青！
    世界和平万岁！
    同志们！朋友们！
    请允许我提议：为中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府的领导人：
    中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东同志，
    中华人民共和国主席刘少奇同志，
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长朱德同志，
    中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来同志干杯！
    为在座的全体中国同志的健康干杯！
    为各位来宾的健康干杯！
