Let's See What Tricks the U.S. Will Play Next
Commentator of this newspaper

The Soviet representative to the Soviet, American, and British conference on the discontinuance of nuclear weapon tests put forward a new proposal at the meeting on the 16th. This proposal made reasonable provisions for the issue of supervision of the cessation of nuclear weapon tests and the criteria and scope for investigating suspected nuclear test phenomena. This is another new effort by the Soviet Union to break the current deadlock in the conference and strive for the conclusion of a treaty on the cessation of all nuclear weapon tests.

Since the resumption of the conference on the discontinuance of nuclear tests in Geneva recently, not only has there been no progress on the long-standing dispute over the supervision of the prohibition of nuclear weapon tests, but also new obstacles created by the United States have been encountered. At the meeting on February 11, the US representative put forward a so-called "new proposal" to resolve the issue of discontinuing nuclear tests in stages. This proposal only stipulates that nuclear weapon tests should not be conducted in the atmosphere and oceans, while they can be conducted underground and in space without restriction. In defending this proposal, the United States has once again harped on the old tune that underground nuclear tests cannot be "detected" and "supervised". But everyone knows that under modern advanced scientific and technological conditions, it is completely impossible for any nuclear weapon test, whether on the ground, underground, in the air, or in the sea, to go unnoticed. This has long been confirmed by the conference of experts from various countries on the discontinuance of nuclear weapon tests held in Geneva in 1958. Therefore, this argument of the United States is untenable. In fact, the so-called "new proposal" of the United States is nothing more than an attempt to open a back door for the United States at the conference on the discontinuance of nuclear tests, so that the United States can resume nuclear weapon tests at any time.

In an editorial published the day after the US proposal was put forward, the "New York Post" pointed out that the US's "limited" ban on nuclear testing was "a victory for the gamblers in the Pentagon and the Atomic Energy Commission." The claim that underground tests "cannot be reliably detected" is just "a cunning excuse."

This attempt by the United States to oppose the cessation of nuclear weapon tests has long been an open secret. Since the conference on the discontinuance of nuclear weapon tests began in Geneva in the autumn of 1958, in order to obstruct the conference from reaching an agreement on the cessation of all nuclear weapon tests, the United States has either erected defenses layer upon layer against the reasonable proposals of the Soviet Union, obstructing them at every turn, or taken a step forward and two steps back, reneging on the propositions and proposals it had once agreed to. When the conference later entered into substantive discussions on the issue of supervision, the United States revealed its true colors even more, openly opposing the prohibition of underground nuclear weapon tests. The US plan is obviously: If an agreement cannot be reached on the issue of stopping underground nuclear weapon tests, then the conference will not be able to sign a treaty on stopping all nuclear weapon tests, and therefore the United States can resume and continue various nuclear weapon tests in other ways in the future.

The current approach of the United States at the conference on the discontinuance of nuclear weapon tests is by no means accidental. This is part of the entire policy of the United States currently stepping up its arms expansion and war preparations. In order to buy time, reverse the military decline of the United States, and revive the so-called "deterrent force" of the United States that has long been bankrupt, the US government is now desperately developing intercontinental missiles and nuclear weapons, striving to expand US missile bases at home and abroad, and strengthening the war machine of the imperialist aggressive bloc. In his budget message to the US Congress on January 18 this year regarding the US fiscal year 1961, US President Eisenhower stipulated that "the development and production of nuclear weapons should be maintained at the high level of previous years." In early February, Eisenhower announced at a press conference that the United States would supply nuclear weapons and their technical data to the countries of the North Atlantic Group. On February 16, in his "foreign aid" message to the US Congress, he again requested an increase in "foreign aid" appropriations so that the North Atlantic Group would "maintain a strong and effective deterrent posture." Obstructing the conclusion of an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapon tests in every possible way reveals the US attempt to continue to improve nuclear weapons and intensify the nuclear arms race. "Stone's Weekly" recently commented on the US attitude towards nuclear test negotiations, saying that "powerful forces in the US government want to end these negotiations forever, thereby forever destroying the hope of reaching a disarmament agreement. They are seeking a plan that will undermine the negotiations, but can shift the blame to Russia." The so-called "new proposal" put forward by the United States on February 11 has this dual purpose.

The truth is difficult to conceal. The people of all countries in the world see very clearly that the reason why the conference on the discontinuance of nuclear weapon tests cannot make progress is entirely due to the obstruction of the United States. The Soviet Union has repeatedly stated its willingness to conclude a treaty banning all nuclear weapon tests, and has expressed its firm commitment to abide by its guarantee not to resume such tests in the Soviet Union, as long as the Western countries do the same. The new proposal put forward by the Soviet representative at the conference on the discontinuance of nuclear weapon tests this time is also to promote the conference to reach an agreement on the issue of the cessation of all nuclear weapon tests. If the United States continues to adhere to its unreasonable demands, opposes the prohibition of underground nuclear weapon tests, and hinders the progress of the Geneva conference on the discontinuance of nuclear weapon tests, then no matter what excuse it uses, it cannot escape its responsibility for undermining the nuclear test ban negotiations. On the contrary, this approach of the United States can only further expose its true face of trying to step up its arms expansion and war preparations, and make the people of all countries see through that the US talk of peace is not worth a penny.

    看美国还耍什么花招
    本报评论员
    苏联出席苏、美、英三国不继续核武器试验会议的代表，在16日会议上提出了一项新建议。这项建议对停止核武器试验的监督问题和调查核试验嫌疑现象的标准和范围问题作了合理的规定。这是苏联为打开目前的会议僵局，争取缔结停止一切核武器试验条约而作的又一次新的努力。
    不继续核试验会议最近在日内瓦复会以后，不但在过去长期争执未决的关于禁止核武器试验的监督问题上毫无进展，而且又遇到了美国所制造的新的障碍。美国代表在2月11日的会议上提出了一项所谓分阶段解决不继续核试验问题的“新建议”。这个建议只规定核武器试验不得在大气层和海洋中进行，而在地下和空间则可以不受限制。美国在为这个建议进行辩解时，又重弹起所谓对地下核试验无法进行“侦察”与“监督”的老调。但是谁都知道，在现代发达的科学技术条件下，任何地上、地下或空中、海里的核武器试验，要不被察觉是完全不可能的。这一点，早已被1958年在日内瓦举行的关于不继续核武器试验的各国专家会议所证实了。因此，美国的这种论调是站不住脚的。实际上美国的所谓“新建议”不过是想使不继续核试验会议为美国打开一扇后门，以便美国可以随时恢复核武器试验。
    “纽约邮报”在美国建议提出后一天发表的社论中指出，美国的这个“有限地”禁止核试验的建议是“五角大楼和原子能委员会里赌徒们的胜利”。所谓地下试验“不能够有把握地侦察出来”的说法，只是“一个狡猾的借口”而已。
    美国反对停止核武器试验的这种企图，早已是一个公开的秘密了。自从不继续核武器试验会议1958年秋天在日内瓦开始举行以来，美国为了阻挠会议达成停止一切核武器试验的协议，不是对苏联的合理建议层层设防，节节阻挠，就是进一步，退两步，出尔反尔地推翻它自己曾经同意过的主张和建议。当会议后来进入关于监督问题的实质讨论时，美国更是露出了自己的狐狸尾巴，公然反对禁止进行地下核武器试验。美国的打算显然是：如果不能就停止地下核武器试验的问题取得协议，那末会议就不可能签订停止一切核武器试验的条约，因而美国以后也就可以用其他方式恢复和继续进行各种核武器试验了。
    美国目前在不继续核武器试验会议上的这种做法决不是偶然的。这是美国当前加紧扩军备战的整个政策的一部分。为了争取时间，挽回美国的军事颓势，重振美国早已破产了的所谓“威慑力量”，美国政府现在正在拼命发展洲际导弹和核武器，竭力扩充美国在国内外的导弹基地，加强帝国主义侵略集团的战争机器。美国总统艾森豪威尔今年1月18日在向美国国会提出的美国1961财政年度的预算咨文中，规定要把“核武器的发展和生产保持在前几年的高水平上”。2月初，艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上宣布，美国要把核武器及其技术资料供给北大西洋集团的国家。2月16日，他在向美国国会提出的“援外”咨文中，又要求增加“援外”拨款，使北大西洋集团内部“保持一种强大的有效的威慑阵势”。百般阻挠达成停止核武器试验协议，正是暴露了美国力图继续改进核武器，加剧核军备竞赛。美国“斯通周刊”最近在评论美国对于核试验问题谈判的态度时说，“美国政府中的强有力的势力想要永远终止这个谈判，从而使达成裁军协议的希望也永远破灭。他们正在寻求一个方案，这一方案将破坏谈判，但是又可以把罪责推到俄国身上”。美国在2月11日提出的这个所谓“新建议”，就是抱着这种一箭双雕的目的的。
    事实真相是难以掩盖的。世界各国人民看得很清楚：不继续核武器试验会议之所以不能取得进展，原因完全在于美国的阻挠。苏联已经一再表明愿意缔结禁止一切核武器试验条约的主张，并且表示坚决遵守它所承担的不在苏联恢复这种试验的保证，只要西方国家也这样做。这次苏联代表在不继续核武器试验会议上提出的新建议，也是为了促进会议就停止一切核武器试验问题达成协议的。如果美国仍然继续坚持它的无理主张，反对禁止地下核武器试验，阻挠日内瓦不继续核武器试验会议的进展，那么不论它用什么借口，都是无法逃避它对破坏禁止核试验谈判的责任的。相反，美国的这种作法，只能进一步暴露它一心要加紧进行扩军备战的真面目，使各国人民看穿美国的和平谈论是一个钱都不值的。
