    Planting Trees Has Its Tricks
    Some people think, "Planting trees has no other tricks, just a hoe and saplings." They believe there's no technological innovation to be done in afforestation. Does planting trees have tricks? The reports on this page provide a strong answer: not only are there many tricks, but they are quite clever.
    Many facts prove that from modern industry to the simplest manual labor, technology can be innovated. Afforestation, such an important production task, can certainly innovate technology, and must innovate technology.
    For most regions, large-scale spring afforestation is about to begin. Let us prepare well and work even more cleverly in the continued leap forward of forestry production this year.

    种树有巧
    “种树无他巧，锄头加树苗”。有些人认为，在植树造林中没有甚么技术革新可搞。种树有没有巧呢？这个专页的报道作了有力的回答：不但巧很多，而且巧得很。
    许多事实证明，上至现代化工业，下到极简单的手工劳动，都能够革新技术，植树造林这样一项重要的生产，当然也能革新技术，也一定要革新技术。
    就多数地区说，大规模的春季造林就要开始了。让我们做好准备，在今年林业生产的继续跃进中干得更巧。
