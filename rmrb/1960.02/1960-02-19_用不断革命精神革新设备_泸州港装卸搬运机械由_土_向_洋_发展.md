    Innovate Equipment with the Spirit of Continuous Revolution
    Luzhou Port's Loading and Unloading Machinery Develops from "Indigenous" to "Foreign"
    Chengdu, February 18th (This newspaper) – Luzhou Port in Sichuan, an advanced collective attending the National Conference of Heroes, has been continuously consolidating and improving its indigenously mechanized loading and unloading through use and modification. Its loading and unloading machinery is now developing towards a "small foreign equipment group." The port has now built a large number of new mechanical equipment such as electric cable cars, electric ropeways, movable pontoon cable cars, grain conveyors, and crawler shuttle troughs. The loading and unloading of bulk cargo and the main loading lines have achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization. The average transportation efficiency has increased three to four times compared to indigenous machinery.
    After achieving indigenous mechanization of loading and unloading, Luzhou Port firmly grasped the "use" aspect, discovering and solving problems in the process, so that loading and unloading machinery could be continuously developed and improved. Because the time of indigenous mechanization of loading and unloading was short, and the machinery was not perfect, there were common shortcomings such as clumsiness, small capacity, and frequent repairs. In addition, workers were not accustomed to operating the new machinery. At the beginning, the indigenous machinery often stopped and started intermittently, and no one was responsible for management. The Luzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China organized workers to conduct a preliminary assessment of the transportation efficiency and performance of the new tools, and implemented a method of "guaranteed use, guaranteed management, and guaranteed improvement" for all indigenous machinery. According to the characteristics of the wharf, fixed contracts were adopted for fixed materials with normal transportation volume; multi-point joint contracts were adopted for materials that were not fixed with transportation volume not very normal; and mobile semi-contracts were adopted for few points with abnormal materials for temporary rush work. This not only strengthened the workers' sense of responsibility but also allowed flexible deployment of labor, increasing the utilization rate of machinery by 45.6% and reducing the tool loss rate by 20%. While strengthening management, the entire port conducted investigations and research on the operation of various indigenous machinery, mobilized the masses for discussion, and formulated improvement plans for different shortcomings, so that indigenous machinery could change from inferior to superior, from clumsy to skillful, from indigenous to foreign, and from weak to strong. For example, the wharf's indigenous winch originally used a shaft core to drive a turntable, which was heavy, laborious, and inefficient. After changing the winch shaft core to a winch turntable, the large drove the small, making it light, effortless, and increasing the average daily transportation volume from 22 tons to 44 tons. Centering on the improvement of indigenous machinery, the entire port also modified more than 50 places such as slopes and lines, and correspondingly developed many machines combining indigenous and foreign methods. Through these improvements, the port's indigenous machinery loading and unloading volume increased from about 4,000 tons per day to 6,400 tons, an increase of 60%.
    Although the transportation capacity of Luzhou Port's indigenously improved loading and unloading machinery has been increasing day by day, it is still felt to be insufficient with the rapid development of production and construction. Indigenous machinery is often powerless when faced with heavy and large materials. Therefore, the development from "small indigenous equipment groups" to "small foreign equipment groups" is imperative, and the loading and unloading of bulk cargo and the main loading lines should be mechanized and semi-mechanized as soon as possible. Their specific methods are: closely combining with production, carefully summarizing the experiences and lessons of indigenous mechanization, conducting three rankings of terrain, materials, and conditions, continuing to implement the policy of "combining foreign and indigenous methods," implementing foreign equipment on uphill slopes and indigenous equipment on downhill slopes, building comprehensive wharves with parallel foreign and indigenous equipment, while paying attention to retaining the indigenous machinery with better effects, gradually transforming and gradually transitioning; according to the distribution and flow of materials, adopting the policy of "firstly ensuring the turnover of vehicles and ships, secondly ensuring key industries, and thirdly ensuring others," so that the layout of foreign and indigenous equipment is more reasonable; when developing "small foreign equipment groups," strengthening contact with relevant departments such as municipal construction, paying attention to long-term considerations, and striving to build permanent equipment where conditions permit. From December last year to now, the port has newly built 21 electric cable cars with a total length of more than 4,800 meters, so that all uphill materials are transported by power, and the average transportation efficiency has increased about ten times compared to indigenous cable cars. The Xiaoshi Wangyemiao Wharf now has both uphill electric cable cars and downhill coal-dropping gravity automatic coal unloading cable cars and grain roller shuttle troughs, changing the previous situation where uphill materials affected downhill materials, and greatly improving transportation efficiency. According to the port's construction plan, after all the new equipment is completed and put into production this year, the total daily loading and unloading volume will reach 40,000 to 60,000 tons, which can guarantee the completion of the annual loading and unloading tasks. The existing 2,700 loading and unloading workers can also be reduced by a quarter to support other departments.
    With the innovation of loading and unloading machinery, Luzhou Port has also correspondingly strengthened the operation and management of the wharf and scientific transportation organization. The city has formed a Port Wharf Management Committee, which has begun to plan and transform existing wharves, strengthen unified management, properly arrange the berthing of vehicles and ships and the stacking locations of materials, and change the past phenomenon of scattered wharves, complex material varieties, and random stacking. At the same time, the labor organization has been rationally adjusted, and the "five fixings" (tasks, personnel, points and lines, time, and responsibility) have been implemented, and the management systems and safety operating procedures for machinery maintenance, custody and distribution, allocation, rewards, and punishments have been further established and improved.

    用不断革命精神革新设备
    泸州港装卸搬运机械由“土”向“洋”发展
    本报成都18日电　出席全国群英会的先进集体——四川泸州港，在实现装卸搬运土机械化以后，经过边用边改，不断巩固提高，装卸搬运机械正向“小洋群”的方向发展。现在，全港已建成电动缆车、电动索道、活动栈桥缆车、粮食输送机、履带梭槽等大批新式机械设备，大宗货物的装卸和主要装卸线实现了机械化、半机械化，平均运输效率比土机械提高了三倍到四倍。
    泸州港实现装卸搬运土机械化以后，紧紧抓住“使用”这一环节，从中发现问题解决问题，使装卸搬运机械不断发展和提高。由于实现装卸搬运土机械化的时间短，机具不够完善，比较普遍地存在着不灵巧，运量小，修理多等缺点，加以工人用新机具操作不习惯，开始时土机械常有时用时停、无人负责管理等现象。中共泸州市委组织职工对新工具的运效和使用性能进行了初步查定，对各项土机械实行了包使用、包管理、包改进的办法。根据码头特点，对物资固定、运量正常的采取固定包；对物资不够固定、运量不很正常的采取多点合包；对点少、物资又不正常的采取机动半包临时突击等多种形式。这样既加强了工人的责任感，又能灵活调用劳动力，使机械利用率较前提高了45．6％，工具损耗率下降了20％。在加强管理的同时，全港对各种土机械运转情况进行了调查研究，发动群众讨论，针对不同的缺点，制订改进方案，使土机械由劣变优，由笨变巧，由土变洋，由弱变牢。如码头土绞车原来以轴心带转盘，笨重费力，运效不高，经过把绞轴心改为绞转盘以后，以大带小，轻巧省力，使平均日运量由原来二十二吨增加到四十四吨。以改进土机械为中心，全港还改坡度和线路等五十多处，并相应地发展了许多土洋结合的机具。通过这些改进，全港土机械装卸搬运量由每天四千吨左右上升到六千四百吨，提高了60％。
    泸州港装卸搬运土机械经过不断改进，运输能力虽然日益提高，但是随着生产建设的迅速发展，运输能力仍感不足；笨重的大型物资，土机械也常常无能为力。因此，由“小土群”向“小洋群”发展势在必行，大宗货物的装卸和主要装卸线尤其要尽快实现机械化、半机械化。他们的具体作法是：紧密结合生产，认真总结土机械化的经验和教训，进行地形、物资、条件三排队，继续贯彻“洋土并举”的方针，实行上坡洋、下坡土，建设洋土并行的综合码头，同时注意保留效果较好的土机械，逐步改造逐步过渡；根据物资集散情况和流量流向，采取“一保车船周转，二保重点工业，三保其它”的方针，使洋土机具布局更加合理；在发展“小洋群”时，加强和市政建设等有关部门的联系，注意从长远着想，在条件许可的情况下，力求建造永远性的设备。从去年12月到现在，这个港已新建电动缆车二十一条，总长四千八百多米，使所有上坡物资都用动力运送，运输效率平均比土缆车提高了十倍左右。小市王爷庙码头现在既有上送电动缆车，又有下煤坠力自动卸煤缆车和粮食滚筒梭槽，改变了以往因上物资而影响下物资的情况，大大提高了运输效率。按照这个港的建设规划，新设备全部在今年内建成陆续投入生产以后，日装卸搬运总量将达四到六万吨，这样就可以保证完成全年的装卸搬运任务。现有二千七百多名装卸搬运工人，也可以减少四分之一支援其他部门。
    随着装卸搬运机具的革新，泸州港还相应地加强了码头的经营管理和科学的运输组织工作。全市组成了港口码头管理委员会，已着手规划和改造现有码头，加强统一管理，妥善安排车船停泊和物资的堆放地点，改变过去码头零落分散、物资品种繁杂、乱堆乱放的现象。同时合理地调整了劳动组织，实行了“五定”（任务、人员、点线、时间、责任），并进一步建立和健全了机具维护、保管领发、调配、奖惩等管理制度和安全操作规程。
