    It's spring forsythia blooming time again,
    The spring breeze has dyed the weeping willows outside the factory building green.
    Thinking of the expert far away in Moscow,
    Endless memories flood my heart.
    Three years ago, you came here,
    And plunged into the fiery battle as soon as you entered the workshop.
    You investigated every place in such detail,
    Busy from morning until the sky was full of stars.
    Stepping out of the workshop in the moonlight,
    You noticed forsythia covering the wall;
    Perhaps to dispel the day's fatigue,
    You lingered for a long time before the golden little flowers.
    You spent three springs and two autumns here,
    Your and the workers' sweat soaked the sand and soil of the workshop.
    How many nights you pondered at the design table,
    How many summer days you guarded the furnace at a temperature of thousands of degrees.
    Your eyes, often bloodshot from staying up late,
    Constantly stir our hearts with concern:
    How many more strands of white hair have been added to your head?
    How many more wrinkles has hard thinking left on your brow?
    You left here last summer,
    Still busy and running around the workshop before leaving.
    The books you sent still retain the fragrance of mimeograph ink,
    And the letters often ask:
    Has the percentage of qualified products increased again?
    It's spring forsythia blooming time again,
    I think of my dear friend in the distance,
    O heart, fly quickly to Moscow!
    Turn deep longing into heartfelt greetings.
    Please rest assured, dear expert,
    The seeds you sowed here are bearing fruit,
    Like this beautiful spring,
    Red flowers blooming all over the branches!

    又是迎春花开放的时候
    北京第一机床厂工人　王恩宇
    又是迎春花开放的时候，
    春风染绿了厂房外的垂柳。
    遥念远在莫斯科的专家，
    无尽的回忆涌上心头。
    三年前的一天你来到这里，
    一进车间就投入火热的战斗，
    每一处你都探察得那么详细，
    从早晨一直忙碌到满天星斗。
    踏着月色你走出车间，
    这才发现一片迎春爬满墙头；
    也许是要驱散一天的劳累，
    你在金黄的小花前停了很久。
    在这里度过了三春两秋，
    你和工人们的汗珠把车间的砂土湿透。
    多少个深夜你在设计桌前凝神苦思，
    多少个夏日你在千度高温的炉旁守候。
    你那常常熬红的双眼，
    时时掀起我们心上的担忧：
    头上的白发又添了几根？
    苦思又把几条皱纹留你额头？
    去年夏天你离开这里，
    临走时还在车间忙碌奔走。
    寄来的书还留着油印的芳香，
    信里还常问：
    正品率又上升了没有？
    又是迎春花开放的时候，
    我想起了远方敬爱的朋友，
    心呵，快快飞到莫斯科吧！
    把深沉的怀念化作由衷的问候。
    请亲爱的专家放心吧，
    你播在这里的种子正孕育着丰收，
    如同这美好的春天，
    红花朵朵满枝头！
