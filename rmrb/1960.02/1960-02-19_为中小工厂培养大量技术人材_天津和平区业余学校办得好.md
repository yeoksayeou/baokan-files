    Training a Large Number of Technical Talents for Small and Medium-sized Factories
    Tianjin Heping District Spare-time Schools Do Well
    (Our report) Tianjin Heping District Workers' Spare-time Secondary Technical School has created a good experience in training technical personnel in a more, faster, better, and more economical way by combining long-term training with short-term training.
    There are many small and medium-sized factories and few technical personnel in Heping District, Tianjin. The types of work are complex, and the number of employees in each type of work is small. It is difficult to carry out systematic technical education in the spare-time schools of these factories in terms of class formation, curriculum setting, and teachers. In response to this situation, the Heping District Education Bureau established a workers' spare-time secondary technical school in 1958. Now, the school has a total of 49 classes, including elementary professional technical classes, secondary professional technical classes, single-subject technical training classes, and professional lectures, with more than 2,400 students from more than 500 factories. There are also regular and irregular special lectures, with about 3,500 employees attending. The students are very enthusiastic about learning, and the attendance rate is often maintained at around 90%.
    Closely integrating with production, adopting the method of combining "long-term training" with "short-term training," combining "systematic advanced studies" with "single-subject specialization," and combining "regular classes" with "special lectures" is an important experience of Heping District Workers' Spare-time Secondary Technical School in training technical personnel in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. At the beginning of its establishment, the school only offered some single-subject advanced training classes that combined technology and culture, that is, one technical course was paired with one cultural course, such as geometry for drawing classes and algebra and physics for engineering mechanics classes. Single-subject advanced training classes are completed in one semester, and students can continue to study systematically. Because single-subject technical advanced training focuses on key points and can be used in production after completion, it is very popular among students. In addition to adjusting the original single-subject technical advanced training classes in conjunction with the current production needs, the school has also established elementary professional technical classes and secondary professional technical classes. And in conjunction with the key production tasks in different periods, technical lectures and systematic technical training courses were organized.
    Currently, the school's elementary technical training classes offer three majors: fitter, metal cutting, and electrical repair. Among them, cultural courses account for 55% and technical courses account for 45%. Workers with a higher elementary school education level are recruited, and after three years of study, they reach the graduation level of ordinary elementary technical schools. In the secondary professional technical classes, there are three majors: machinery manufacturing, motor manufacturing, and electrical equipment for industrial enterprises. Among them, cultural courses account for 45% and technical courses account for 55%. Workers with a junior high school education level are recruited, and after four years of study, they are equivalent to the graduation level of ordinary secondary technical schools. These two types of technical classes adopt the method of simultaneous advancement of cultural courses and technical courses in terms of curriculum settings; at the same time, the arrangement of cultural courses is also adjusted accordingly according to the needs of technical courses and production. In this way, students can not only systematically improve and reach the predetermined training goals after completing all majors, but also combine with current production and solve production problems when learning each professional course.
    Workers who do not have the conditions for systematic improvement but urgently need to learn a production technology can enter the single-subject advanced training class to study. Such classes are divided into three categories: motors and electrical appliances, machinery, and radio, including twelve specialized training classes, recruiting workers with a higher elementary school education or above, studying for half a year. After graduation, you can also choose other majors.
    Over the past year, through technical education, many employees have improved their technical level and solved key problems in technical innovation. Most of the more than 1,500 students who graduated from the single-subject advanced training class of this school in the first half of last year have now become technical backbones. Many people have also become technicians. Zheng Xinwei, Wang Qingjie, and Cao Qingxiang, students of the metal cutting class and workers of Tianjin Fifth Internal Combustion Engine Factory, collectively created a universal machine tool. Meng Zhaozhou, a student of the machinery manufacturing class and fitter of Tianjin Forging Machine Tool Factory, learned knowledge such as drawing and design and manufactured a valve grinding machine with the assistance of other workers, increasing work efficiency by twelve times.
    Under the leadership and help of the CCP Heping District Committee, the school also pays attention to mobilizing the enthusiasm of all sectors of society to run schools, in order to train more technical talents at the fastest speed and with the least amount of funds. Without school buildings, they borrowed more than 30 classrooms from Tianjin No. 17 Middle School and the First Branch of Gansu Road Primary School. The city and district science and technology popularization associations and other units also lent them equipment and science and technology films. Lacking technical course teachers, the school introduced engineering and technical personnel from relevant factories and enterprises to the school to concurrently serve as technical courses through the city and district science departments and factory and enterprise party committees. Among the school's existing 52 faculty and staff members, 39 part-time teachers are engineering and technical personnel from 27 factories and enterprises.

    为中小工厂培养大量技术人材
    天津和平区业余学校办得好
    本报讯　天津市和平区工人业余中等技术学校，采取长期培养和短期训练相结合的方法，创造了多快好省地培养技术人材的好经验。
    天津市和平区中小型工厂多、技术人员少，工种复杂，每一个工种的职工人数很少。在这些工厂的业余学校中进行系统的技术教育，在编班、设课和师资等问题上都存在着一定的困难。和平区教育局针对这种情况，1958年创办了一所工人业余中等技术学校。现在，这个学校有初等专业技术班、中等专业技术班、单科技术专修班和专业讲习班共四十九个班级，学员包括来自五百多个工厂的二千四百多人。还有定期和不定期的专题讲座，听课职工约三千五百多人。学员们的学习热情很高，出席率经常保持在90％上下。
    紧密结合生产，采取“长期培养”和“短期训练”相结合、“系统深造”和“单科专修”相结合、“正规班级”和“专题讲座”相结合等两条腿走路的方法，是和平区工人业余中等技术学校多快好省地培养技术人材的一项重要经验。这个学校在建校初期只开办了一些技术文化“二合一”的单科进修班，即一门技术课配上一门文化课，如制图班兼学几何，工程力学班兼学代数物理等。单科进修班一学期一结业，学员还可以继续系统进修。由于单科技术进修重点突出，学完就能用于生产，因此很受学员欢迎。这个学校除了结合当前生产急需调整了原有的单科技术进修班外，又举办了初等专业技术班和中等专业技术班。并结合不同时期的生产关键，组织了技术讲座和系统的技术讲习班。
    目前，这个学校的初等技术学习班设有钳工、金属切削加工和电气检修三个专业。其中文化课占55％，技术课占45％，招收高小毕业程度的工人，学习三年后达到普通初等技术学校毕业水平。在中等专业技术班里设有机械制造、电机制造和工业企业电气设备三个专业。其中文化课占45％，技术课占55％，招收初中毕业程度的工人，学习四年后相当普通中等技术学校毕业水平。这两类技术班在课程设置方面采取了文化课和技术课同时并进的办法；同时，在文化课的安排上也根据技术课和生产的需要作了相应的调整。这样，既可以使学员学完了全部专业以后，得到系统提高达到预定的培养目标；又能在学习每一门专业课程时和当前的生产结合起来，解决生产问题。
    没有条件进行系统提高而又急需学习一种生产技术的工人，可以进入单科进修班学习。这样的班级分电机电器、机械和无线电三大类，包括十二个专修班，招收具有高小以上文化程度的工人，学习半年。毕业后还可以再选修其他专业。
    一年多来通过技术教育，不少职工提高了技术水平，解决了技术革新中的关键问题。去年上半年在这个学校单科进修班毕业的一千五百多名学员，现在绝大部分都成了技术骨干。不少人还当了技术员。金属切削加工班学员、天津第五内燃机厂工人郑心维、王庆杰和曹庆祥集体创制了一台万能机床。机械制造班学员、天津锻压机床厂钳工孟昭舟学习了制图学等知识，在其他工人的协助下，设计制造了研阀机，提高工作效率十二倍。
    这个学校在中共和平区委的领导和帮助下，还注意调动社会上各方面办学校的积极性，以最快的速度，用最少的资金，培养更多的技术人材。没有校舍，他们就向天津市第十七中学和甘肃路小学第一分校借用了三十多间教室。市、区科学技术普及协会等单位也借给他们仪器设备和科学技术电影等。缺乏技术课教师，学校便通过市、区科学部门和工厂企业党委等各级组织，介绍有关工厂企业的工程技术人员来学校兼任技术课。这个学校现有的五十二名教职员中，有三十九名兼职教师是来自二十七个工厂企业的工程技术人员。
