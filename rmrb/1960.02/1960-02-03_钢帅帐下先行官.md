Vanguard Under the Steel Commander (Shandong KuaiShu)
北京市运输公司 (Beijing Transportation Company)
The copper clappers ring out merrily, let's get straight to the main story,
We won't talk about the heroes of industry and agriculture,
But sing of a vanguard of transportation,
This person is named Yang Qingtai,
Smart and capable, a Communist Youth League member,
A truck driver who travels north and south.

One day, the northwest wind howled,
Chilling one to the bone,
He received a new task of transporting stones,
Yang Qingtai didn't hesitate upon hearing this,
He started the engine and drove onto the transportation line,
In an instant, he arrived at Lugou Bridge,
Beside the Yongding River's great sandbank.

He parked the truck, and the loaders worked with gusto,
In no time, the truck was full,
Yang Qingtai started the engine with a roar,
And drove straight to the Shuangjiazhen construction site,
His heart filled with joy along the way,
He thought: Shuangjiazhen is thirty-four kilometers from here,
Three trips are neither too few nor too many,
With extra effort, I can even finish ahead of schedule.

He arrived at the construction site and looked carefully,
Trucks flowed like water, people like a river, a lively scene,
He found the material receiver and quickly completed the procedures,
The loaders unloaded the truck like a whirlwind,
In an instant, the truck and trailer were emptied,
He hurriedly turned the truck around to return.

In short, it was really fast,
The time reached half past four,
He had already arrived at the construction site for the third trip,
But unexpectedly, trucks were lined up for a long distance,
It turned out there weren't enough loaders,
Yang Qingtai thought his plan would fail,
He was so anxious that his heart burned like fire,
Truly like an ant on a hot pot, running around in circles.

Watching the red sun pressing against the mountain peak,
He finally finished unloading the truck,
The clock had already passed six thirty,
Yang Qingtai hurried back anxiously,
Arriving at Lugou Bridge, it was already late at night, silent and deserted,
The loaders had all taken the bus back to the depot,
The sandbank was empty and desolate, without a soul.

Yang Qingtai stood on the sandbank in a daze,
He couldn't help but think:
If he drove back to the depot,
He could take a hot shower and have dinner,
But this trip would be empty and wasted,
Wasting gasoline and losing the state's money;
If he insisted on making another trip,
Without loaders, it would be futile.

He stood against the wind and suddenly waved his hand,
Saying to himself:
"You're supposed to be a Communist Youth League member,
You bend at the waist at such a small difficulty!
If there are no loaders, do it yourself,
You must not waste the state's money!"

Thinking of this, his spirits lifted,
He threw off his coat and picked up a shovel,
The weather was freezing and the stones were hard,
But how could it stop the hero's firm will,
One shovel after another, he loaded the stones onto the truck,
One bead of sweat after another fell onto the ground,
The heat turned into frost,
Gusts of north wind were chilling to the bone,
Yang Qingtai gritted his teeth and didn't rest,
Fatigue, hunger, and cold were thrown aside,
He loaded for an hour and a half in one breath,
Eight tons of stones were finally loaded,
At this time, he was already exhausted,
His wet underwear was soaked with sweat.

He hurriedly jumped into the driver's seat,
Started the engine and sped away,
The truck arrived at the construction site,
Dark and silent, without a soul,
He finished unloading the truck and felt happy,
He stretched out his arms to relax,
Looking up at the sky, clear as water,
The cold stars twinkled.

He drove the truck back to the motorcade victoriously,
The morning sun shone brightly,
The team leader was anxiously looking for him,
Seeing him return victoriously, he was very happy,
People cheered and applauded,
Lifting Yang Qingtai up and spinning him around.

Yang Qingtai's loading eight tons and unloading eight tons became a legend,
His heroic deeds spread throughout the motorcade,
This is truly, there are no weak soldiers under the Steel Commander,
He is indeed a vanguard of the Great Leap Forward.

    钢帅帐下先行官（山东快书）
    北京市运输公司　禹堂铜板一打响得欢，闲话少说开正篇，工农业的英雄咱不表，唱一个运输的先行官，此人姓杨名清泰，精明能干是个共青团员，走南闯北是汽车驾驶员。这一日，西北风刮得唿唿响，吹得人身上刺骨寒，他接到运石子的新任务，杨清泰听说不怠慢，一轰电水汽车开上了运输线，霎时来到卢沟桥，永定河旁的大沙滩。他把汽车停住后，装卸工人就干得欢，不大工夫车装满，杨清泰一打马达声震天，开车直奔双家坟建筑工地，一路上心中好喜欢，他心想：双家坟离此三十四公里，三趟定额不窄也不宽，加把劲超额还能提前。来到了工地留神看，车如水人如流热火朝天，他找着了收料员忙办手续，装卸工人卸车风卷残云般，一霎时汽车拖车就卸净，他急忙调转车头往回翻。简断截说真叫快，时间到了四点半，他第三趟已经到工地，却不料汽车排了一长串，原来是装卸工人不够用，杨清泰想到计划要落空，急得他心焦如火烤，真好像热锅上蚂蚁打转转。眼看着红红的太阳压山尖，好不容易卸完了车，时针已经过了六点半，杨清泰心急如火往回赶，到了卢沟桥已经更深人静夜色阑，装卸工人们都乘车回场去，沙滩上空空荡荡没有人烟。杨清泰站在沙滩上发了怔，止不住心中打算盘：有心开车回场去，洗个热水澡好进晚餐，可是，这一趟空驶白放过，浪费汽油还得损失国家的钱；有心坚持再拉一趟，没有装卸工人也枉然。他伫立风前猛然一挥手，对着自己开了言：“亏你还是个共青团员哪，这么点小困难你就把腰弯！没有装卸工人自己干，绝不能白浪费国家的钱！”想到此处精神抖，甩掉大衣就抄起铁锨，天寒地冻石子硬，怎挡英雄的意志坚，一锨锨石子装在汽车上，一颗颗汗珠落在地上边，团团的热气化冰霜，阵阵的北风刺骨寒，杨清泰咬紧牙关不歇手，疲劳饥饿寒冷丢在一边，一气装了一个半钟头，八吨石子这才装完，这时他累得已经精疲力尽，湿淋淋的内衣汗沾满。他急忙跳进驾驶室，打动马达一溜烟，汽车来到了工地上，黑沉沉的没有人烟，他卸完了汽车心高兴，伸开了双臂好舒坦，仰头看天清如水，点点寒星眨巴眼。他驾驶汽车胜利返回汽车场，满天朝霞亮了天，车队长正在着急把他找，见他胜利而归好喜欢，人们欢呼又鼓掌，把杨清泰抬起直转圈。杨清泰装八吨卸八吨成了佳话，英雄的事迹遍场传，这才是，钢帅帐下无弱将，不愧为大跃进的先行官。
