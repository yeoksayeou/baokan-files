    Cuba is a country famous for its sugarcane production. Its sugarcane production and export rank first in the world. The national sugarcane planting area is 1,103,000 hectares, accounting for 56% of the total arable land, and 500,000 people directly participate in sugarcane planting and the sugar industry. Sugar production accounts for 30%-40% of the national income, and the output of sugar and sugar by-products accounts for 86% of Cuba's total exports, with annual foreign exchange earnings of 500 to 600 million US dollars. However, due to the control and plunder of American monopoly capital, this country, known as "the sweetest country in the world," was one of the most suffering countries before the revolution. Its abundant sugarcane provided more profits for American monopoly capital and did not benefit the Cuban people. After the victory of the revolution, the United States used Cuba's economic weakness of relying on the single production of sugarcane and relying on the single American market to continuously lower sugar prices and reduce Cuba's sugar import quota in the American market as a means of interfering in Cuba's internal affairs, coercing it to stop land reform, and stifling the Cuban revolution. Therefore, in the past year, the Cuban people have launched a sharp struggle with the United States to solve the sugar problem.
    Cuba's semi-colonial economic structure of single sugarcane production was entirely created by American monopoly capital. Before the 19th century, Cuba under Spanish colonial rule was a country with a single production of tobacco. At the end of the 19th century, American capital began to invest in the Cuban sugar industry. In 1905, sugar factories controlled by the United States already produced 21% of Cuba's total sugarcane production. Before the victory of the Cuban Revolution, American monopoly capital's investment in the Cuban sugar industry amounted to 540 million US dollars, accounting for more than 50% of the total American investment in Cuba. The thirty-six sugar factories belonging to American companies consumed 36.7% of Cuba's national sugarcane and occupied 47.5% of Cuba's sugarcane planting area. These American companies employed 167,000 sugarcane planting and sugar-making workers, accounting for about 35.5% of all sugar industry workers.
    The eight largest American companies monopolizing the Cuban sugar industry all have close ties with American monopoly financial groups. The Rockefeller family directly owns the American Sugar Refining Company and the Alegre Cape Company in Cuba, which occupy a major position in the Cuban sugar industry. And the other two sugar companies (Atlantic Gulf Sugar Company and United Fruit Company) also have Rockefeller family capital. Ranked second is the Atlantic Gulf Sugar Company operated by Loeb-Rhodes. The remaining large sugar companies are the Chicago Consortium's West Indies Sugar Company, Lehman Brothers' Camaguey Sugar Company, Devey Kaiser's Cuban-American Sugar Company, and the Brug-Rionda family's Brug-Rionda Company.
    American sugar companies in Cuba all own vast sugarcane plantations and have become Cuba's largest landlords. Most of the land of these companies was obtained by means of coercion and plunder. The land acquired by American companies that invaded Cuba in the early days was very cheap. They used military decrees to seize Cuba's best land at extremely low prices and violently drove the peasants away. For example, the Nipe Bay Company, which belongs to the United Fruit Company, bought 3,713 caballerias (one caballeria equals 201.45 Chinese mu) of land for one hundred US dollars, which is equivalent to open plunder. After that, the plantations of American companies continued to expand, especially during the rule of the Batista dictatorial regime. Batista's policy of offering gifts provided American companies with the most convenient conditions for plundering Cuban land and resources. By the time Batista's tyranny collapsed, the land occupied by American sugar companies reached 108,000 caballerias, accounting for 17% of Cuba's national land. American sugar companies in Cuba extended their aggressive claws to the interior and coast of Cuba. Many companies had affiliated banks, shops, newspapers, radio stations, schools, wharves, and their own police.
    These American sugar companies seized astonishingly high profits in Cuba. In the past twenty-one years, the net profit of the eight companies reached 265.5 million US dollars, equivalent to five times the average capital. But on the other hand, the situation of Cuban sugarcane planting and sugar-making workers was extremely bad. They only had work during the sugarcane harvest season, which lasted for no more than three to five months each year. Apart from this period, the workers had to buy the things they and their families needed on credit from the "shops" controlled by the companies. As a result, the amount of credit purchases often exceeded the total wages that could be earned in the next harvest season, which turned Cuban workers into slaves of American companies.
    In order to seize high profits and completely place Cuba under its control, American monopoly capital strictly controlled Cuba's foreign trade, making Cuba a raw material exporting country dependent on the single American market and a sales market for American commodities. At present, two-thirds of Cuba's total exports go to the United States, and more than 50% of sugar exports go to the United States, and three-quarters of all imports come from the United States. Since American monopoly capital monopolizes Cuba's foreign trade, it ruthlessly exploits Cuba through the unequal price policy of "buying cheap and selling dear" that it is accustomed to using. Especially in the export of Cuban sugarcane, the United States unilaterally stipulates the quota for the sale of Cuban sugar in the American market and the ratio of selling raw sugar and refined sugar according to the so-called "Sugar Act," as a tool to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs and stifle Cuba's economy. Due to the United States' unilateral and arbitrary actions to undermine the so-called "reciprocity" principle, from 1953 to 1959, Cuba's sugar exports to the United States were reduced by 3.7 million short tons (one short ton equals 2,000 pounds), worth 385 million US dollars. From 1948 to 1958, Cuba had a trade deficit of 603 million US dollars with the United States, and the deficit in settlement with the United States caused Cuba to lose more than 950 million US dollars in currency reserves. In 1959, the total export value was 765.2 million US dollars, while the total import value reached 800.2 million US dollars.
    Another serious consequence of American control of Cuba's foreign trade is that it seriously hinders the normal development of the Cuban economy, thereby deepening its dependence on the United States. Before the victory of the revolution, Cuba had almost no industry except for the sugar industry and the transportation and public utilities related to the sugar industry that were relatively developed. For example, as the world's largest sugarcane producer and exporter, 67% of chocolate and candy were imported from the United States. As Castro said in a speech, Cuba "exports sugar, imports candy; exports leather, imports leather shoes; exports iron, imports plows."
    After the victory of the Cuban Revolution, the upper echelons of the American ruling clique, monopoly capitalists, reactionary newspapers, and notes from the American State Department to the Cuban government repeatedly used the "Sugar Act," a tool for interfering in Cuba's internal affairs, to coerce Cuba to stop land reform and compromise and regress by reducing Cuba's sugarcane import quota to the American market.
    Not only that, the United States also condones Cuban traitors who fled to the United States to use American bases and drive American planes to fly to Cuba again and again to drop American-made incendiary bombs and bomb Cuban sugarcane plantations in an attempt to destroy the Cuban sugarcane harvest. However, this economic blackmail of Cuba by the United States, and the destruction of Cuban sugarcane plantations, just like its interference and subversion conspiracies against Cuba, have not achieved its wishes. While defending the revolution and opposing American interference, the Cuban government and people resolutely carried out the reorganization of the economic structure in order to solve the sugarcane problem that has brought endless disasters to the Cuban people for a long time.
    First, Cuba resolutely carried out land reform to abolish the large estate system. In the past year, it has confiscated or taken over the land of large landlords (including American large landlords) throughout the country and distributed this land to farmers with no or little land. Foreigners (mainly targeting Americans) are prohibited from owning land in Cuba, and anyone is prohibited from operating both sugarcane plantations and sugar factories at the same time. This measure not only destroyed the feudal land relations that hindered the development of Cuba's productive forces, but also was a serious blow to the American sugar companies that owned a large amount of land in Cuba.
    Second, Cuba is vigorously developing a diversified crop economy. Cuba's land reform has created good conditions for transforming Cuba's single sugarcane production economic structure, improving agricultural production, and realizing industrialization. The Cuban government has organized the confiscated or taken-over land into cooperatives that grow a variety of crops. By the beginning of this year, more than 500 cooperatives have been established throughout the country. In 1959, in addition to bumper harvests of traditional crops such as sugarcane, coffee, and tobacco, the planting area and output of other crops such as rice, cotton, potatoes, peanuts, soybeans, and vegetables also increased, thereby reducing the import of these commodities, saving foreign exchange, and laying the foundation for transforming the single-crop economy.
    Third, in order to change the unfavorable situation of simply relying on the American market, the Cuban government actively expanded the sugar sales market. The Cuban economic delegation headed by Guevara visited ten countries in Asia and Africa and signed trade agreements with the United Arab Republic, Ceylon, and other countries, exchanging Cuban sugarcane and other traditional export commodities for the commodities that Cuba needed. Cuba also conducted two trade deals with Venezuela and Mexico without American interference, one of which was Venezuela buying 40,000 tons of sugar from Cuba.
    Of great significance for stabilizing Cuban sugar prices and expanding the sales market is that the Cuban government conducted trade in selling sugarcane with the Soviet Union and China one after another in 1959. The Soviet Union bought a total of 500,000 tons of Cuban raw sugar twice in August and September last year. When the first batch of sugarcane was traded, the spot price of Cuban raw sugar in the New York Stock Exchange fell to 2.58 US cents per pound, which was the lowest price since World War II. American monopoly capital is using this factor that is unfavorable to the Cuban economy to clamor that if Cuba does not stop land reform, the United States will reduce Cuba's sugar import quota. It was precisely at this time that the Soviet Union purchased the first batch of 170,000 tons of raw sugar from Cuba. Just as Cuban Minister of Economy Raúl Cepero Bonilla pointed out when announcing the news, "This transaction has a high degree of constructive significance. After the news that the Soviet Union and Cuba were negotiating to purchase Cuban sugar spread, sugar prices have risen in recent days." At the end of September, after Cuba's negotiations with France on the sale of sugarcane broke down, the Soviet Union bought another 330,000 tons of raw sugar from Cuba at a price of 2.95 US cents per pound. This not only increased Cuba's foreign exchange income and raised the price for Cuba to sell stockpiled sugarcane in the future, but also, as pointed out by the Cuban National Stabilization Bureau, "This transaction has established a very stable market for Cuba." After that, on December 31 last year, China signed the first trade agreement to purchase Cuban raw sugar with Cuba. Cuba is also conducting the same trade negotiations with socialist countries such as Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic.
    Due to the measures taken by the Cuban government, the sales situation of Cuban sugarcane in the world market has been greatly improved. At the same time, facing the continuous bombing and destruction of sugarcane plantations by planes from the United States, people from all walks of life in Cuba are widely mobilizing and investing in the struggle to defend the sugarcane harvest. Workers, rebel soldiers, students, housewives, and freelance professionals are all voluntarily going to sugarcane plantations to rush to harvest sugarcane. Many people are volunteering to go to sugar factories to help workers with their work. Therefore, as long as the Cuban people unite more closely, defend and develop the revolution, and unswervingly implement an independent economic policy, they will inevitably be able to transform the semi-colonial economic structure of single production and a single market, thereby crushing the United States' conspiracies against the Cuban revolution in the economic field, especially in the sugarcane issue.

    古巴的蔗糖问题
    章叶
    古巴是一个以盛产蔗糖著名的国家。它的蔗糖生产和出口都占世界第一位。全国甘蔗种植面积达一百一十万三千公顷，占全部耕地面积的56％，直接参加甘蔗种植和制糖业劳动的达五十万人。糖的生产在国民收入中占30％—40％，糖和糖副产品的输出占古巴出口总值的86％，每年外汇收入达五、六亿美元之多。但是，由于美国垄断资本的控制和掠夺，这个被称为“世界上最甜的国家”，在革命胜利以前，却是苦难最多的国家之一，它丰产的蔗糖为美国垄断资本提供更多的利润，并没有造福古巴人民。在革命胜利以后，美国又利用古巴依赖单一生产蔗糖和依赖单一的美国市场这个经济上的严重弱点，不断以压低糖价和削减美国市场上古巴糖的进口份额，作为干涉古巴内政、胁迫停止土地改革和扼杀古巴革命的手段。因此，一年来古巴人民在解决食糖问题上同美国展开了尖锐的斗争。
    古巴单一生产蔗糖的半殖民地性质经济结构，完全是美国垄断资本所造成的。在十九世纪以前，西班牙殖民统治下的古巴是一个单一生产烟草的国家。在十九世纪末期，美国资本开始向古巴糖业投资。1905年时美国控制的糖厂已经生产了古巴全部蔗糖生产的21％。到古巴革命胜利以前，美国垄断资本在古巴糖业的投资达五亿四千万美元，占美国对古巴投资总额50％以上。属于美国公司的三十六家糖厂消耗了古巴全国36．7％的甘蔗，占有古巴甘蔗种植面积的47．5％。这些美国公司雇用了十六万七千名甘蔗种植和制糖工人，约占全部糖业工人的35．5％。
    垄断古巴糖业的八家最大的美国公司，都同美国垄断金融集团有密切关系。洛克菲勒家族在古巴直接拥有美国炼糖公司和阿莱格雷角公司，它们在古巴制糖工业中占居主要地位。而另外两家糖公司（大西洋海湾糖公司和联合果品公司）也有洛克菲勒家族的资本。占第二位的是由洛伯—罗迪斯经营的大西洋海湾糖公司。其余几家大的糖业公司是芝加哥财团的西印度群岛糖公司，利曼兄弟经营的卡马圭糖公司，德维·凯塞经营的古—美制糖公司和勃勒格—里翁达家族经营的勃勒格—里翁达公司。
    在古巴的美国糖公司都拥有面积广大的甘蔗种植园，成了古巴最大的庄园主。这些公司的土地大部分是用巧取豪夺的手段得来的。那些在早期侵入古巴的美国公司所获得的土地都是非常便宜的，它们利用军事法令以极低的价格夺取古巴最好的土地，并用暴力把农民赶走。例如属于联合果品公司的尼贝·巴意公司以一百美元购买了三千七百一十三卡瓦耶里亚（一卡瓦耶里亚等于二百零一点四五中国亩）的土地，这等于公开掠夺。在这以后，美国公司的庄园不断扩大，特别是在巴蒂斯塔独裁政权统治时期，由于巴蒂斯塔的奉送政策，为美国公司提供掠夺古巴土地和富源的最便利的条件。到巴蒂斯塔暴政垮台时为止，美国糖业公司所占的土地达十万八千卡瓦耶里亚，占古巴全国土地的17％。在古巴的美国糖业公司把它的侵略魔爪伸到了古巴内地和海边，许多公司都附设了银行、商店、报馆、广播电台、学校、码头，并且有自己的警察。
    这些美国糖公司在古巴攫取了惊人的高额利润。在最近二十一年中，八家公司的纯利达到二亿六千五百五十万美元，相当于平均资本的五倍。但在另一方面，古巴甘蔗种植和制糖工人的处境却异常恶劣，他们每年只在为期不超过三到五个月的甘蔗收获季节里有工作。除了这个时期以外，工人们不得不向公司操纵下的“商店”赊购他们自己和家庭所需要的东西。结果，往往是赊购的款项超过了在下次收获季节里所可能获得的全部工资，这使得古巴工人变成了美国公司的奴隶。
    美国垄断资本为了攫取高额利润和把古巴完全置于自己的控制之下，严格地控制了古巴的对外贸易，使古巴成为依赖单一的美国市场的原料输出国和美国商品的销售市场。目前，古巴全部出口的三分之二输往美国，而糖的出口50％以上输往美国，全部进口的四分之三来自美国。美国垄断资本既然垄断了古巴的对外贸易，它们就通过惯用的“贱买贵卖”的不平等价格政策残酷盘剥削古巴。特别是在古巴蔗糖出口方面，美国根据所谓“食糖法”，片面规定美国市场上销售古巴糖的定额以及销售原糖和精糖的比例，作为干涉古巴内政和扼杀古巴经济的工具。由于美国片面和蛮横地破坏所谓“互惠”原则的行动，从1953到1959年，古巴输往美国的糖缩减了三百七十万短吨（一短吨等于二千磅），价值三亿八千五百万美元。从1948到1958年，古巴同美国的贸易有六亿零三百万美元的逆差，与美国支付结算的逆差使古巴货币储备损失了九亿五千多万美元。1959年的出口总值为七亿六千五百二十万美元，而进口总值却达八亿零二十万美元。
    美国控制古巴对外贸易的另一严重恶果是，严重地妨碍了古巴经济的正常发展，从而加深了它依赖美国的程度。在革命胜利以前，除了制糖业和同制糖业有关的交通运输和公用事业较为发达以外，古巴几乎没有任何工业。例如，作为世界上最大的蔗糖生产和出口国，67％的巧克力和糖果却从美国输入。正像卡斯特罗在一次演说中所说的，古巴“出口食糖，进口糖果；出口皮革，进口皮鞋；出口铁，进口犁。”
    在古巴革命胜利后，美国统治集团的上层人物、垄断资本家、反动报刊，以及美国国务院给古巴政府的照会，就利用“食糖法”这个干涉古巴内政的工具一再以减少古巴蔗糖向美国市场的进口份额，胁迫古巴停止土地改革和妥协倒退。
    不仅如此，美国还纵容逃亡到美国的古巴叛徒，利用美国的基地，驾驶美国的飞机，三番五次地飞往古巴投掷美国制造的燃烧弹，轰炸古巴的甘蔗种植园，妄图破坏古巴甘蔗收获。但是，美国对古巴的这种经济上的讹诈，和对古巴甘蔗种植园的破坏，正如同它对古巴的干涉、颠覆阴谋一样，并没有如愿以偿。古巴政府和人民在保卫革命、反对美国干涉的同时，坚决进行了经济结构的改组工作，以解决这个长时期以来给古巴人民带来无穷灾难的蔗糖问题。
    第一，古巴坚决进行了废除大庄园制的土地改革。一年以来，在全国各地没收或接管了大庄园主（包括美国大庄园主）的土地，把这些土地分给无地或少地的农民。禁止外国人（主要针对美国人）在古巴占有土地，并禁止任何人同时兼营甘蔗园和糖厂。这个措施不但破坏了阻碍古巴生产力发展的封建土地关系，而且也是对在古巴拥有大量土地的美国糖业公司的严重打击。
    第二，古巴正在大力发展多种作物经济。古巴的土地改革为改造古巴单一生产蔗糖的经济结构，提高农业生产，实现工业化创造了良好条件。古巴政府把没收或接管的土地组成了种植多种作物的合作社。到今年年初，全国各地已经建立了五百多个合作社。1959年，除甘蔗、咖啡、烟草等传统作物获得丰收外，其他作物如稻米、棉花、土豆、花生、大豆、蔬菜的播种面积和产量也都增加了，从而减少了这些商品的进口，节约了外汇，并为改造单一作物经济制奠定了基础。
    第三，古巴政府为了改变单纯依赖美国市场的不利情况，积极扩大蔗糖的销售市场。以格瓦拉为首的古巴经济代表团访问了亚非十国，并且同阿联、锡兰等国签订了贸易协定，用古巴的蔗糖和其他传统出口商品换取古巴所需要的商品。古巴还同委内瑞拉和墨西哥进行了两项没有美国干涉的贸易，其中一项是委内瑞拉向古巴买了四万吨糖。
    对稳定古巴蔗糖价格和扩大销售市场具有重大意义的是，古巴政府在1959年先后同苏联和中国进行了销售蔗糖的贸易。苏联在去年8月、9月两次共买了古巴原糖五十万吨。在第一笔蔗糖成交时，纽约交易所的古巴原糖离岸牌价跌到每磅二点五八美分，这是第二次大战以后最低的价格。美国垄断资本正利用这个对古巴经济不利的因素，大肆叫嚣如果古巴不停止土地改革，美国就要削减古巴糖的进口份额。正是在这个时期，苏联购买了古巴第一批原糖十七万吨。正像古巴经济部长劳尔·塞佩罗·博尼利亚在宣布这项消息时所指出的，“这笔交易具有高度的建设意义。苏联和古巴谈判购买古巴糖的消息传出后，最近几天糖价上涨了。”9月底，在古巴同法国谈判销售蔗糖问题破裂后，苏联又以二点九五美分一磅的价钱向古巴买了三十三万吨原糖。这不仅增加了古巴的外汇收入，为古巴今后出卖积存蔗糖提高了价格，而且也像古巴全国稳定局所指出的，“这笔交易为古巴建立了非常稳固的市场”。在这以后，去年12月31日，中国同古巴签订了第一个购买古巴原糖的贸易协定。古巴还同捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国等社会主义国家进行同样的贸易谈判。
    由于古巴政府采取了上述措施，已经使古巴蔗糖在世界市场上的销售情况大大改善。同时，面对着来自美国的飞机连续不断的轰炸破坏甘蔗种植园，古巴各阶层的人民正在广泛地动员起来，投入保卫甘蔗收获的斗争，工人、起义军战士、学生、家庭主妇、自由职业者都自愿到甘蔗种植园去抢收甘蔗。许多人自愿到糖厂里去帮助工人干活。因此，只要古巴人民更加紧密地团结起来，保卫和发展革命，坚定不移地执行独立的经济政策，就必然能够改造单一生产和单一市场这个半殖民地性质的经济结构，从而粉碎美国在经济上，特别是在蔗糖问题上反对古巴革命的阴谋。
