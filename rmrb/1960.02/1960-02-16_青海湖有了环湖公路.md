Qinghai Lake Now Has a Circum-Lake Highway

    The circum-lake highway built around Qinghai Lake, China's largest inland lake, has recently opened to traffic. This circum-lake highway is 449 kilometers long.
    Qinghai Lake is 3,040 meters above sea level and covers an area of more than 4,200 square kilometers, and is rich in scaleless fish. After the completion of the circum-lake highway, it will play an important role in developing Qinghai Lake's aquatic industry and promoting the economic prosperity of the counties along the route.

    青海湖有了环湖公路
    围绕我国最大的内陆湖青海湖而修建的环湖公路，最近通车。这条环湖公路全长四百四十九公里。
    青海湖拔海三千零四十米，面积四千二百多平方公里，湖内盛产无鳞鱼。环湖公路建成后，对发展青海湖的水产事业和促进沿线各县经济的繁荣将起重要作用。
