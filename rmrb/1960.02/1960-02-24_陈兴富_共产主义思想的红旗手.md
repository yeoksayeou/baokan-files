    Chen Xingfu - Standard Bearer of Communist Thought

    He enthusiastically helped his comrades with technical innovations, turning many into active innovators and advanced producers; those he helped, in turn, enthusiastically helped others, bringing more than four hundred people to advanced levels.

    (Our Chongqing Dispatch, February 23rd, by reporter Lin Pinglan) Chen Xingfu, a milling machine operator and Communist Party member at the Chongqing Chang'an Machine Factory, under the leadership and support of the Party organization, enthusiastically helped the workers around him to innovate technically. Since last year, thirty-five people who previously did not engage in technical innovation have started to do so under his direct help, and eighty-five people who previously engaged in limited innovation have significantly increased their efforts. As a result of his help, over thirty people have become advanced producers. Those who received help from Chen Xingfu also learned from him and actively helped others. With the help of these individuals, another four hundred and twenty-seven people have reached advanced levels of production.

    Why does Chen Xingfu have this spirit of enthusiastically helping others? It turns out he has an idea: "The cause of communism is very great, it is a collective cause, and it cannot be accomplished by relying on a few people." Chen Xingfu himself has excellently completed the state plan for three and a half consecutive years, produced zero defective products for six years, and maintained safe production for ten years. In the past year alone, he implemented 1,142 innovation proposals, saving more than 200,000 yuan in value. However, Chen Xingfu believes that his achievements can only play a limited role in the great cause of communism, and only when everyone fully exerts their strength can we accelerate socialist construction.

  Starting with Raising Awareness

    Chen Xingfu discovered that many of those working with him were young people from the countryside who had recently joined the factory. They were strong, smart, and lively, but some were playful and did not use their brains in production, especially being unwilling to engage in technical innovation, believing that "this is the business of veteran workers." Chen Bangsheng, a first-grade milling worker next to his station, loved to fight and make trouble. Having been in the factory for over a year, he had not submitted a single innovation proposal. Chen Xingfu decided to help him first.

    Initially, Chen Xingfu smiled and went over to Chen Bangsheng, asking, "Xiao Chen, how about we help each other and engage in technical innovation together?" Chen Bangsheng pushed back, saying, "My brain isn't good for anything." Several attempts to discuss innovation were rebuffed by the young man.

    Later, Chen Xingfu learned that Chen Bangsheng wanted to learn to play basketball, so Chen Xingfu borrowed a ball from the club and invited Xiao Chen to practice together. After some time, the two became familiar, and Xiao Chen gradually opened up. Once, after playing basketball, while washing their hands together, Xiao Chen said, "When I get off work, I just want to go home. Innovation is too much trouble." Chen Xingfu said, "That's because you're not used to it. Once you get used to it, you won't be afraid of trouble. For example, playing basketball makes you covered in dust, but it's still enjoyable. Moreover, you can't be afraid of trouble in doing anything, and you certainly can't be afraid of trouble in building socialism..."

    Then one day, Chen Xingfu, as usual, arrived at the workshop earlier than others. He saw that the light at the neighboring station was on, and it was Xiao Chen diligently cleaning his machine. Chen Xingfu was about to go over to encourage the young man when Xiao Chen came over first, his face red, and said, "Last night I thought about it, and I don't know what I was thinking before! I am determined to learn from you, not only your skills but also your collectivist thinking, and to boldly engage in technical innovation..."

    With Chen Xingfu's repeated assistance, Chen Bangsheng has transformed from August of last year to the present, having implemented more than five hundred and thirty innovation proposals. He was also named an advanced producer of the factory last year. The machine tool Chen Bangsheng works on has also been named a Red Flag Machine Tool. And Chen Bangsheng is just one of dozens of young workers directly helped and transformed by Chen Xingfu.

      Helping with Skills, Giving Credit

    Yang Shaoqing was an older worker with over ten years of experience. Feeling that he was getting old and couldn't work as fast as the younger ones, he wanted to innovate in the factory's technical innovation movement, but he was afraid to take the plunge. Chen Xingfu saw through Master Yang's concerns, and also noticed that Yang Shaoqing was working on a type of part that was small in size, had many processes, and was difficult to process. Chen Xingfu wanted to help him improve this operation first. Once the opening drums are sounded, Master Yang would dare to innovate boldly. Chen Xingfu told Yang Shaoqing about the improved plan, and the two immediately tried it out. It was successful on the first try, and the efficiency greatly increased. Chen Xingfu reported the news of Yang Shaoqing's successful technical innovation to the labor union, and the labor union immediately wrote a congratulatory report for Yang Shaoqing and sent it over with drums and gongs. Upon receiving the congratulatory report, Yang Shaoqing said uneasily, "This was clearly suggested by Master Chen, how can it be considered my innovation?" However, Chen Xingfu firmly declined, saying that Yang Shaoqing played the main role. Since then, Yang Shaoqing has indeed become bold in carrying out innovation, implementing many innovation proposals.

    Relying on Collective Strength

    Chen Xingfu not only patiently helped others himself, but also, under the leadership of the Party organization, united many people to use collective strength to help comrades. He found Wen Maosong, an older worker from another workshop, to jointly initiate the establishment of a technical innovation mutual aid group. Later, nineteen pacesetters also joined the group. They each returned to their workshops and united a group of people. Because this technical innovation group included technical innovation pacesetters from various workshops and various types of work, it was able to pool ideas and solve key problems, and it was also convenient to help the masses engage in technical innovation, which was widely welcomed by the masses. Now, this innovation group has developed into a pacesetter group for the entire factory, becoming the general staff for technical innovation in the entire factory. In the past few months, they have implemented more than four thousand relatively significant innovation proposals, helping many workers improve their technical level.

    The Party committee of the Chang'an Machine Factory attaches great importance to Chen Xingfu's communist spirit of selfless assistance to others. Through various means, they have widely and deeply publicized his advanced thinking and advanced experience to the factory's employees, creating a wave of learning from Chen Xingfu and catching up with Chen Xingfu throughout the factory. The fourth workshop, where Chen Xingfu is located, has become an advanced workshop in the entire factory. Xue Gong, Yang Chunhua, learning from Chen Xingfu enthusiastically helped his partner, enabling another worker, Li Zuyuan, to implement 135 innovation proposals, increasing work efficiency by up to twenty-three times. Li Zuyuan also actively helped another worker, enabling this worker to implement 47 technical innovation proposals.

    陈兴富——共产主义思想的红旗手
    他满腔热情地帮助伙伴闹革新，使许多人成了积极革新者和先进生产者；受过他帮助的人又热心帮助别人，使四百多人达到先进水平
    本报重庆23日电　记者林平兰报道：重庆长安机器厂铣工、共产党员陈兴富，在党组织的领导和支持下，满腔热情地帮助周围工人革新技术。去年以来，在他直接帮助下，由不搞技术革新进而搞革新的有三十五人，由少有革新进而大搞革新的八十五人；由于他的帮助，成为先进生产者的有三十多人。受过陈兴富帮助的人，也学习陈兴富，积极帮助别人。在这些人的帮助下，生产达到先进水平的又有四百二十七人。
    陈兴富为什么有这种热情帮助别人的精神？原来他有个想法：“共产主义事业伟大得很，是集体的事业，依靠少数人是不能完成的”。陈兴富自己连续三年半都出色地完成了国家计划，六年不出废品，十年安全生产，仅去年一年就实现革新建议一千一百四十二条，节约价值达二十万元以上。但是陈兴富认为：自己这些成绩，对伟大的共产主义事业只能起有限的作用，要大伙都充分发挥出力量，才能加速社会主义建设。
  从提高觉悟入手
    陈兴富发现跟自己一块工作的，有不少是才进厂不久的农村青年，身强力壮，聪明活泼，但有的人贪玩，不把脑筋用在生产上，特别是不愿意搞技术革新，认为“这是老师傅的事”。跟他邻车的青年陈邦胜，是一级铣工，爱打架，又爱闹，进厂一年多，没有提过一件革新建议。陈兴富决定先帮助他。
    开头，陈兴富笑着跑过去问陈邦胜：“小陈，我们互相帮助，一道搞技术革新好不好？”陈邦胜却推说：“我这脑筋，没啥搞的”。几次谈革新的事，都被小伙子碰了回来。
    后来，陈兴富了解到陈邦胜想学打篮球，陈兴富便在俱乐部借了球，约小陈一起练习。过了一些日子，两人混熟了，小陈渐渐说起心里话来。有一次，他们打过球，一块洗手，小陈说：“我这个人，下了班就想往回走，搞革新怕麻烦。”陈兴富说，“这是没搞习惯，习惯了，就不怕麻烦了。譬如打球，搞得一脸都是灰，还很畅快。而且，干任何事都不能怕麻烦，建设社会主义更不能怕麻烦……”。
    后来有一天，陈兴富照例比别人提前进车间。一看，邻车的灯开着，是小陈在埋头打扫车子。陈兴富正想过去鼓励小伙子几句，小陈却先走过来了，脸红红的说：“昨晚我想了一下，以往我思想不知想到哪里去了！我下决心向你学习，不仅要学习你的技术，更要学习你的集体主义思想，要大胆搞技术革新……”
    陈邦胜在陈兴富多次帮助下，从去年8月份开始转变到现在，已经实现了五百三十多件革新建议，去年还被评为厂里的先进生产者。陈邦胜工作的机床，也被命名为红旗机床。而陈邦胜只是陈兴富直接帮助转变过来的几十个青年工人中的一个。
      帮技术　让荣誉
    杨绍清是个有十几年工龄的老工人。因为自己感到年纪大，干活不如年青人手脚快，在全厂技术革新运动中，他虽然也想搞革新，但是不敢下手。陈兴富看穿了杨师傅的心意，又看到杨绍清作一种零件规格小，工序多，很难加工，就想帮助他先把这一操作改进一下。这次开场锣鼓打响了，杨师傅就敢大胆革新了。陈兴富把改进的意见告诉了杨绍清，两人立即试验，一试便成功了，工效大大提高。陈兴富把杨绍清革新技术成功的消息报告给工会，工会立即给杨绍清写了张喜报敲锣打鼓地送去。杨绍清接到喜报不安地说：“这明明是陈师傅提的，怎么能算是我的革新？”但是，陈兴富坚决推辞，说是杨绍清起了主要作用。此后，杨绍清搞革新果然大胆起来，实现了许多革新建议。
    依靠集体力量
    陈兴富不仅自己耐心地帮助别人，还在党组织的领导下，团结了许多人，用集体力量去帮助同志们。他找另一个车间的老工人文茂松共同发起成立技术革新互助组，后来十九个标兵也都参加到组里来。他们又各自回车间团结了一批人。由于这个技术革新小组包括各车间、各工种的技术革新标兵，能够集思广益，解决关键问题，又便于帮助群众搞技术革新，受到群众普遍欢迎。现在，这个革新小组已发展成为全厂的标兵团，成了全厂技术革新的参谋部。几个月来，他们实现了比较重大的革新建议四千多件，帮助许多工人提高了技术水平。
    长安机器厂党委非常重视陈兴富无私帮助别人的共产主义精神，通过各种方式向全厂职工广泛深入地宣传了他的先进思想和先进经验，全厂掀起了学陈兴富、赶陈兴富的热潮。陈兴富所在的四车间成了全厂的先进车间。学工杨春华学习陈兴富热情地帮助自己的伙伴，使另一个工人李祖元，实现了革新建议一百三十五项，最高提高工效二十三倍。李祖元又积极帮助另一个工人，使这个工人实现技术革新建议四十七项。
