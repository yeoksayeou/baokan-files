Xinhua News Agency, February 9th. The capital's literary and art circles, numbering 1,200 people, gathered tonight to commemorate the centenary of the birth of Anton Pavlovich Chekhov, a world cultural figure and great Russian writer.

The commemoration was jointly organized by the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Chinese Writers Association, and the Chinese Dramatists Association.

Burhan, a member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council and Vice-Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, presided over the commemoration. In his opening remarks, he said that Chekhov was a great writer of the Russian people. Today, as we commemorate this great writer, let us carry forward the spirit of hatred for reactionary forces and facing the future in his works under new historical conditions, and make great contributions to the cause of peace and progress for mankind.

Mao Dun, a member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, Vice-Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, delivered a report entitled "Chekhov, the Great Realist" at the meeting. He said that Chekhov's works sharply satirized and vehemently criticized the vulgarity, hypocrisy, ugliness, and decadence of the old society, arousing people's hatred for the old society. Especially his later works showed his trust in the strength of the people of his motherland, his vision of the inevitable collapse of old Russia, and his confident welcome to the arrival of a new era. All this had a profound effect on Russian society and literature, and also had a considerable influence on the new literature of our country during the period of the democratic revolution. His works' opposition to autocratic enslavement, opposition to vulgarity and decay, and the idea of placing unlimited hope and confidence in a better tomorrow still have great practical significance for the people of all countries in the world who are striving for freedom and liberation today. Mao Dun said that the Chinese people attach great importance to Chekhov's literary heritage and will strengthen its research and study from a Marxist-Leninist perspective.

Sudalikov, Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in China, said at the meeting that the celebration of the centenary of Chekhov's birth in our country and China happens to be held on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and mutual assistance. Based on this treaty, the ties and cooperation in all aspects between our two countries and peoples have been continuously consolidated and developed over the past ten years, greatly helping the construction of socialism and communism. Sino-Soviet cultural cooperation has also played an important role, enabling us to exchange experiences in cultural construction and understand each other's latest achievements in literature and art.

Among those present at the commemoration tonight were Ding Xilin, Yang Hansheng, Tian Han, Lao She, Shao Quanlin, Ouyang Yuqian and other figures from the capital's literary and art circles. There were also responsible personnel from the Soviet Embassy in China and cultural counselors from the embassies of fraternal countries in China.

At today's commemoration, Shvidov, Vice-Chairman of the Russian Theater Association of the Soviet Union, and Dr. Markov, Professor of the Lunacharsky State Institute of Theater Arts of the Soviet Union, who were recently invited to visit our country, were also welcomed.

After the commemoration, the Beijing People's Art Theater performed Chekhov's famous play "Three Sisters."

    首都文学艺术界一千二百多人集会
    新华社9日讯　首都文学艺术界一千二百多人今晚集会，纪念世界文化名人、俄罗斯伟大作家安东·帕夫洛维奇·契呵夫诞生一百周年。
    纪念会是由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国人民对外文化协会、中苏友好协会总会、中国文学艺术界联合会、中国作家协会和中国戏剧家协会联合举办的。
    世界和平理事会常务委员会委员、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席包尔汉主持纪念会。他在开幕词中说，契呵夫是俄国人民的伟大作家，今天我们纪念这位伟大的作家，让我们在新的历史条件下发扬他作品中憎恨反动势力面向未来的精神，为人类的和平与进步事业作出伟大的贡献。
    世界和平理事会常务委员会委员、中国文学艺术界联合会副主席、中国作家协会主席茅盾在会上作了题为“伟大的现实主义者契呵夫”的报告。他说，契呵夫的作品尖锐地讽刺和猛烈地抨击旧社会中的庸俗、虚伪、丑恶和腐朽的现象，引起人们对旧社会的憎恨。特别是他的晚期的作品，表明他对祖国人民的力量是信赖的，他看出了旧俄罗斯的必然崩溃，他满怀信心地欢呼新时代的到来。这一切对于俄国社会和文学发生过深远的作用，也对我国民主革命时期的新文学产生过不小的影响。他的作品中的反对专制奴役，反对庸俗腐朽，向美好的明天寄予无限希望和信心的思想，对于今天世界上争取自由解放的各国人民，仍然有极大的现实意义。茅盾说，中国人民十分重视契呵夫的文学遗产，并且要以马克思列宁主义观点来加强对它的研究和学习。
    苏联驻华大使馆参赞苏达利柯夫在会上讲话说，对契呵夫诞生一百周年纪念会的庆祝，在我国和中国恰好都是在苏中友好同盟互助条约签订十周年的前夕举行的。在这个条约的基础上，十年来我们两国和人民之间各方面的联系和合作不断得到巩固和发展，大大地帮助了社会主义和共产主义建设。苏中文化合作也起了重要的作用，使我们能够互相交流文化建设方面的经验，了解彼此文学艺术上最新的成就。今晚出席纪念会的有首都文学艺术界人士丁西林、阳翰笙、田汉、老舍、邵荃麟、欧阳予倩等人。还有苏联驻华大使馆的负责工作人员和兄弟国家驻华使馆的文化专员。
