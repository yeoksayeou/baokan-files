Seed Expert - Chen Zhilun
He cultivated a high-quality wheat variety with more than 120 grains per ear, characterized by stiff stalks and flood resistance; multi-cob corn yielding about one kilogram per plant; sweet potatoes weighing more than seven kilograms each...
Chen Zhilun, a young farmer and seed selector from Meishan County, Sichuan Province, and secretary of the Dongfeng People's Commune Party Committee, has diligently studied since 1953. Using methods such as environmental cultivation, grafting, and hybridization, he has cultivated 21 new varieties of crops, including rice, corn, wheat, cotton, sweet potatoes, taro, vegetables, rapeseed, native tobacco, double-season grapes, and early-maturing honey peaches, greatly increasing the yields of these crops.
Chen Zhilun was born into a poor peasant family and is a demobilized soldier of the People's Liberation Army who returned to his hometown in 1953. Over the past few years, he has persevered, starting with natural and botany studies from primary and secondary schools, all the way to Darwin's theory, agricultural biology, plant cultivation, soil science, genetics, Michurin's collected works, and books related to breeding. At the same time, he also paid special attention to the study of political theory. When he first started studying these books, he faced significant difficulties due to his poor educational background. Because he had a clear learning objective and lofty ideals, he repeatedly studied a theoretical problem two, three, or even four times until he understood it; sometimes, when he became dizzy from reading, he would splash cold water on himself to clear his head and then continue studying. But more importantly, he could apply what he learned to practical situations. Chairman Mao's "On Practice" helped him understand that the objective world can be known and instilled in him the belief that the laws of agricultural production can also be understood. He believed that as long as people master and utilize them, they can transform low yields into high yields.
In 1954, the masses elected him as the production committee member of the agricultural cooperative. The agricultural cooperative also specifically allocated a portion of land as a base for scientific research experiments.
One day, as he and the production team leaders were inspecting production, they saw that the wheat in the fields, which was growing very well, was lodging in patches, and everyone felt very sorry. One production team leader, pulling at the weeds by the roadside, said, "Why can't this wheat grow as upright as these weeds!" This sentence greatly inspired Chen Zhilun, who was in deep thought. Upon closer inspection, he realized that this was drought-resistant and flood-resistant wild wheatgrass. He thought: Could it be hybridized with wheat? How wonderful it would be if wheat could grow like wild wheatgrass! He went alone to the fields to collect pollen from the wild wheatgrass. However, he waited from morning to noon without seeing any pollen from the wild wheatgrass. After observing and waiting for several days, he could not sleep well or eat well. Until the afternoon of the fourth day, he could no longer bear it and grabbed a handful of wild wheatgrass and shook it vigorously on the paper. Ah, there was pollen! It made him extremely happy. A question arose in his mind: Wheat blooms in the morning, so why does wild wheatgrass bloom only in the afternoon? With a difference of two or three hours between them, can they be hybridized? He remembered reading in a botany book that distant hybridization often leads to incompatibility and infertility. What should he do? He was frowning alone in distress. Suddenly, someone patted him hard on the shoulder, "Old Chen, failed again?" He looked up and saw Xu Shaohe, the district party secretary. Secretary Xu encouraged him kindly, saying, "A Communist Party member should not be afraid of difficulties. Even if you fail, don't be discouraged, keep going." This conversation added greatly to his courage. That night, he tossed and turned and couldn't sleep. Suddenly, he remembered the story of the Soviet film "The Tamer of Tigers": she could tame fierce tigers and make them obey, so couldn't I do something about this weed? The next day, he tried using Lysenko's method of treating corn with long-day and short-day conditions to treat the wheat, delaying its flowering period, and collected wild wheatgrass pollen for pollination. Finally, he harvested 314 not-very-full hybrid seeds. In the autumn of 1955, he sowed these precious seeds in a field, and some tall-stalked and some short-stalked plants grew. He then used the "step-by-step hybridization method" to hybridize them with several local wheat varieties. Over three or four years, he selected and bred four new wheat varieties that were stiff-stalked, flood-resistant, lodging-resistant, adaptable, with large ears and many grains. These new wheat varieties had more than 120 grains per ear, and the average yield per mu in large areas was around 680 to 720 jin, nearly doubling the yield compared to local wheat varieties.
The success of wheat hybridization enabled Chen Zhilun to find some of the laws to unlock the secrets of plants. Following this path, he forged ahead courageously and created boldly, and new varieties were born one after another from his hands. His hometown mainly produces corn, but the yield has always been low, only 200 to 300 jin per mu. After careful observation and research, he found that the reason for the low yield was mainly the small number of ears per corn plant, short ears, and sparse grains. Therefore, he fully utilized the advantages of hybridization to break with historical conventions, using dent corn as the "drill wood" and popcorn as the "inoculum"; in the second generation, he used the pollen of dent corn to pollinate the silks of asexually grafted corn, obtaining seeds; subsequently, through single-plant selection and cultivation, he bred a new multi-cob corn variety with many ears and many grains, with seven or eight cobs per plant, capable of yielding about one kilogram of corn. In addition, he also successively cultivated several other new corn varieties with high yield, good flour quality, early maturity, and resistance to lodging. Among them, "Liuxi No. 6" corn yielded as high as 2,000 jin per mu.
Under Chen Zhilun's leadership and help, many Party and League members and activists in this commune participated in scientific research experiments. They learned and worked simultaneously, and not only in staple foods, but also in cash crops and other aspects, a thriving scene of a hundred flowers blooming appeared. The new peach variety they cultivated using peach and plum grafting methods has small pits and a lot of flesh, and the largest weighs as much as 13 liang each; a high-yielding sweet potato can weigh more than seven jin. They also used local ducks and Xichang ducks to create the miracle of a duck weighing 13 jin.

    种子专家——陈志伦
    他培育的小麦良种，每穗有一百二十多粒，具有秆硬、耐涝等特点；多包玉米每株可收一公斤左右；红薯每个七斤多重……。
    四川眉山县青年农民选种家、东风人民公社党委书记陈志伦，从1953年以来，刻苦钻研，用环境培育、嫁接、杂交等方法，育成了水稻、玉米、小麦、棉花、红苕、芋头、蔬菜、油菜、土烟、双季葡萄、早熟水蜜桃等作物的新品种二十一个，大大提高了这些作物的产量。
    陈志伦出生在一个贫农家庭里，是人民解放军的复员军人，1953年回到了自己的家乡。几年来，他始终坚持不懈，从中小学的自然、动植物学学起，一直到达尔文学说、农业生物学、植物栽培学、土壤学、遗传学、米丘林选集和一些有关育种的书籍。同时，他还特别注意政治理论的学习。在开始学习这些书籍时，由于他的文化基础差，困难的确很大。因为他有了明确的学习目的和远大的理想，一个理论问题搞不通，就一遍、两遍甚至三四遍地反复钻研；有时看书看昏了头，他就用冷水浇，让头脑清醒了再继续学习。但更重要的是他学了以后，能联系实际加以运用。毛主席的“实践论”，使他懂得了客观世界是可以被认识的道理，树立了农业生产的规律也是可以认识的信念。他相信，只要人们掌握它、利用它，就可以变低产为高产。
    1954年，群众选他担任农业社的生产委员。农业社并且专门拨出一部分土地，作为科学研究试验的基地。
    一天，他和生产队长们一道检查生产，看见地里长得很好的小麦，一片一片地倒伏了，大家心里非常痛惜。一个生产队长扯着路旁的野草说：“这些小麦为啥就不能像野草一样，长的立伸伸的呵！”这句话大大启发了正在沉思的陈志伦。他仔细一看，原来这正是耐旱耐涝的野麦草。他想：能不能用它来同小麦杂交呢？如果小麦也能像野麦草一样的生长该多好！他独自跑到田野去接野麦草的花粉。可是，从早上守到中午，都不见野麦草的花粉。一连观察、等待了好几天，他觉睡不好，饭吃不下，直到第四天下午，他再也忍不住了，就扯了一把野麦草猛地在纸上一抖，呵，有了花粉呵！真使他高兴极了。一个疑团涌上了他的心头：小麦是上午扬花，为什么野麦草偏偏要在下午才扬花呢？它们中间相错两三点钟，能杂交吗？他记得一本植物学书上曾经说过：远缘杂交往往有不可交配性和不孕性。怎么办呢？他一个人呆呆地在发愁。突然，有人在他肩上猛的一拍，“老陈，又失败了吗？”他抬头一看，是区委书记徐绍和。徐书记很亲切地鼓励他说：“一个共产党员不要怕困难，纵然失败了也不要灰心，要继续搞下去。”这次谈话给他增添了很大的勇气。当晚，他翻来复去再也睡不着觉，忽然想起苏联影片“驯虎女郎”的故事：她能把猛虎驯服听人使唤，难道我对这野草就没办法吗？第二天，他试用李森科处理玉米的长日照和短日照的方法来处理小麦，延迟它的扬花期，采集了野麦草的花粉进行授粉。最后终于收获了三百一十四颗不很饱满的杂种。1955年秋天，他把这些宝贵的种子播种在一块地里，长出了一些高秆的、矮秆的穗株来；他再用“梯级杂交法”和本地几个小麦品种进行杂交，在三四年间，选育出了四个秆硬、耐涝、抗倒伏、适应性强、穗大粒多的小麦新品种。这些小麦新品种每穗有一百二十多粒，大面积亩产平均在六百八十多斤至七百二十斤左右，比本地小麦品种增产将近一倍。
    小麦杂交成功了，使陈志伦找到了揭开植物秘密的一些规律。循着这条轨迹，勇往直前，大胆创造，一个个的新品种都从他手里诞生了。他的家乡主产玉米，但产量一直不高，每亩只收两三百斤。经过他仔细观察、研究，发现产量不高的原因主要是每株玉米穗少、穗短、粒稀少。于是，他充分利用杂交优势打破历史陈规，采用马齿型玉米作钻木，爆裂型玉米作接种；第二代又用马齿玉米的花粉，授在无性嫁接成功的玉米丝上，获得了种子；随后以单株选择、培育等办法，育成了一种结穗多、粒子多的多包玉米新品种，每株有七、八包，能收玉米一公斤左右。此外，他还先后育成了产量高、粉质好、成熟期早、能抗倒伏的其它几个玉米新品种。其中“柳溪六号”玉米，亩产高达两千斤。
    在陈志伦的带动和帮助下，这个公社的许多党、团员和积极分子都参加了科学研究试验。他们边学边干、边干边学，不仅在主粮上，而且在经济作物等各方面，都出现了百花竞放的欣欣向荣景象。他们用桃李嫁接方法，育成的桃子新品种，核小肉多，最大的每个重达十三两；高产红苕，一个即有七斤多重。他们还用本地鸭和西昌鸭杂交，创造了一只鸭体重十三斤的奇迹。
