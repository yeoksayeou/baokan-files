Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 18th: According to reports in today's newspapers, Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, said at a meeting held at the Prime Minister's Office on the 17th to summarize agricultural, forestry, and fishery production last year, that this year is an important year for North Vietnam. It is the final year of the Three-Year Plan and a year to prepare for the first Five-Year Plan. Industrial production must be done well, and agricultural production must be done even better. The current task of the entire Party and the entire people is to ensure a bumper harvest in winter and spring production.

President Ho told the representatives that to build a socialist North, it is necessary to continuously move forward, making progress year after year.

He said that to embark on socialism, we must walk on two legs: industry and agriculture. Our industry has made progress, but if agriculture does not progress or progresses slowly, it will be crippled. Therefore, we must strive to advance agriculture.

President Ho said that to achieve progress, agriculture, like all other work, must put politics in command. It must be ideologically clear from top to bottom, from within the Party to the people. When ideology is clear, we can overcome difficulties and realize our plans.

President Ho instructed the representatives to strengthen ideological education for the peasants, so that they understand that they must build the country diligently and thriftily.

He also pointed out that agricultural cooperatives are the main force in rural areas, and they must be consolidated. In material terms, they must be well managed. In spiritual terms, peasants must be educated to understand why agricultural cooperatives must be consolidated and why the personal interests of cooperative members must be correctly combined with the interests of the country.

In his speech, President Ho also discussed issues such as water conservancy construction, agricultural tool reform, and the development of animal husbandry in agricultural production.

Vice Premier Pham Hung said at the meeting on the 16th that the direction of large-scale agricultural production in North Vietnam in 1960 is: on the basis of expanding and consolidating the collectivization movement, vigorously and comprehensively promote agricultural production, focusing on grain production, while vigorously developing cash crops, animal husbandry, and forestry production.

He emphasized that in the development of agricultural production, a major task at present is to vigorously improve agricultural tools. Because under the current and long-term conditions in North Vietnam, relying on agricultural tool reform to develop production and increase yield per unit area is still the best way.

He said that it is also necessary to pay special attention to the development of animal husbandry, because animal husbandry will provide the traction needed for agricultural production.

Pham Hung said that currently, 45.4% of farmers in North Vietnam have joined agricultural cooperatives. The collectivization movement, which has a broad mass base, has achieved rapid and healthy development. He said that in this movement, three aspects of work—changing production relations, improving production technology, and educating agricultural cooperative members and the masses of peasants with socialist ideology—are carried out simultaneously and closely integrated.

He said that although agricultural production in 1959 encountered many difficulties, it still achieved great victories. Agricultural production has initially become comprehensive. The yields of miscellaneous grains, cash crops, and other crops have mostly increased compared to 1958.

Pham Hung said that agriculture must not only properly solve the people's growing needs for grain and food, but also store more grain for the country and the people, provide more raw materials for industrial production, increase more sources of goods for export, and thereby continuously improve the people's lives.

    胡志明主席在越南农林渔业生产会议上讲话
    号召越南全党全民保证农业生产丰收
    范雄指出今年以粮食生产为主同时大力实行多种经营
    新华社河内18日电　据此间报纸今天报道，越南民主共和国主席胡志明17日在总理府召开的总结去年农、林、渔业生产的会议上说，今年是越南北方重要的一年，是三年计划最后的一年，而且是为第一个五年计划做好准备的一年。工业生产要搞好，农业生产更要搞好。全党、全民当前的任务是保证冬春生产的丰收。
    胡主席对代表们说，要建设社会主义的北方，必须不断地前进，一年要比一年进步。
    他说，走上社会主义要用两条腿走路：工业和农业。我国的工业有了进步，如果农业不进步或缓慢，那就是蹩了脚，因此必须努力把农业向前推进。
    胡主席说，要取得进步，农业和其它所有的工作一样，必须政治挂帅，必须从上而下，从党内到人民打通思想。思想通了，就能够克服困难和实现计划。
    胡主席指示代表们要加强对农民的思想教育，使他们懂得必须勤俭建国。
    他还指出，农业合作社是农村的主要力量，必须巩固农业合作社。在物质方面要管理得好，在精神方面，要教育农民，使他们懂得为什么要巩固农业合作社和为什么社员的个人利益要和国家的利益正确地结合起来。
    胡主席在讲话中还谈到农业生产方面兴修水利、农具改革、发展畜牧业等问题。
    范雄副总理16日在这个会议上说，1960年越南北方大搞农业生产的方向是：在扩展、巩固合作化运动的基础上，大力、全面地推动农业生产，以粮食生产为主，同时大力发展经济作物、畜牧业和林业生产。
    他强调说，在发展农业生产中，当前的一项重大任务是大力改良农具。因为在越南北方当前和以后的一个长时期内的条件下，依靠农具改革发展生产和提高单位面积产量仍然是最好的办法。
    他说，还必须特别重视发展畜牧业，因为畜牧业将对农业生产提供所需要的牵引力。
    范雄说，目前越南北方已有45．4％的农户加入农业合作社。具有广泛群众性的合作化运动获得了迅速和健康的发展。他说，在这个运动中，三个方面的工作——改变生产关系、改进生产技术、用社会主义思想教育农业社社员和农民群众——是同时紧密结合进行的。
    他说，1959年的农业生产虽然遇到许多困难，但仍然取得了巨大的胜利。农业生产已经初步具有了全面性。杂粮、经济作物以及其它农作物的产量大都比1958年增加。
    范雄说，农业不仅要妥善解决人民对于粮食、食品日益增长的需要，而且必须为国家和人民储备更多的粮食，为工业生产提供更多的原料，为出口增加更多的货源，并由此不断改善人民的生活。
