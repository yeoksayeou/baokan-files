Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin. To meet the growing demand for raw materials due to the vigorous development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in factories and enterprises, Tianjin has launched a mass campaign focused on collecting industrial raw materials by seizing and recovering "waste products."

From mid-December of last year to the end of January this year, factories, enterprises, government offices, schools, and residents across the city cleaned out 246,000 tons of various waste materials, valued at over 117.7 million yuan, equivalent to the total amount of waste products recovered in the city in 1958. This included scrap steel, waste aluminum, waste paper, rags, old shoes, waste hemp rope ends, waste rubber, old cotton, waste machinery, hardware, and transportation equipment, etc. Scrap steel alone amounted to 120,000 tons, waste machinery to more than 17,000 units, and waste paper, rags, old shoes, and other papermaking raw materials sufficient for the city's papermaking industry for three months.

Strengthening the Party's leadership and vigorously launching mass movements are the fundamental guarantees for the rapid progress and great effectiveness of the waste product recovery movement. Throughout the city, from the municipal level to the district and street levels, and from the competent bureaus to the factories and workshops, waste product recovery offices or groups were established at each level, with the Party organization secretary taking the lead as the core leading group. Various government offices, organizations, and schools also had dedicated personnel responsible for carrying out the recovery work. Workers and residents enthusiastically participated in this movement.

In this movement, the finance and trade system strengthened the purchasing, sorting, and allocation work, enabling various waste materials to be quickly used in production. They adopted a method combining mobile purchasing and fixed purchasing to facilitate the sale of waste products by various units and residents. Factories universally organized district-wide collaboration and exchange meetings or exhibitions to allocate old machinery, tools, and other materials cleaned out by the factories. In just over a month, Hexi District organized four collaboration conferences, where 285 factories and enterprises mutually allocated 416 items of waste materials.

    天津开展群众运动
    突击回收“废品”
    据新华社天津电　天津市以收集工业原料为主，开展了群众性的废品回收突击运动，以适应工厂企业技术革新和技术革命运动蓬勃发展对原料材料需要量增多的新形势。
    从去年12月中旬开始到今年1月底，全市工厂、企业、机关、学校、居民共清理出各种废旧物资二十四万六千吨，价值一亿一千七百多万元，相当于1958年全市的废品回收量。其中包括废钢铁、废铝、废纸、破布、旧鞋、废麻绳头、废橡胶、旧棉、废旧机械和五金交通器材等等；废钢铁就有十二万吨，废旧机械一万七千多台，废纸、破布、旧鞋等造纸原料足够全市造纸行业用三个月。
    加强党的领导，大搞群众运动，是使废品回收运动进展迅速、收效大的根本保证。全市从市到区、街，从主管局到工厂、车间，层层成立了废品回收办公室或小组，由党组织书记挂帅组成核心领导小组；各机关、团体、学校也都设有专人负责开展回收工作。职工、居民们都踊跃地参加了这个运动。
    在这个运动中，财贸系统加强了收购和整理、调剂工作，使各种废旧物资能迅速用于生产。他们采取流动收购和固定收购相结合的方法，便利各单位和居民出售。各厂对工厂清理出的旧机械、工具等物资，普遍组织了全区性的协作交流会或展览会进行调剂。河西区在一个多月里组织了四次协作大会，有二百八十五个工厂、企业相互调剂了四百十六项废旧物资。
