Every Drop to the Fields, Resist the Spring Drought, Guarantee Spring Planting
Hebei Makes Water Use Plans, Carries out Large-Scale Human and Machine Collaboration, and the Area of Spring Irrigation Increases Rapidly

(Our newspaper, Tianjin, 27th report) A magnificent struggle against drought is being carried out in the vast rural areas of Hebei Province. The prominent characteristic of this struggle is that all localities are paying attention to using various water sources "more, faster, better, and more economically."

Hebei Province's irrigated area has reached more than 80 million mu, water storage is also higher than last year, and agricultural irrigation machinery has more than doubled compared to last year, but because of deep plowing, square fields, and more fertilizer, the water demand is also greater than last year. Therefore, while actively expanding and developing water sources, using water more, faster, better, and more economically has become an important issue in the current drought resistance effort.

In order to make the existing water sources play a greater role "more, faster, better, and more economically," all localities have made water use plans. According to the soil moisture conditions and existing water sources, they are classified and prioritized according to the severity and urgency of water needs, so as to irrigate more and save water. In the western mountainous area of Handan Prefecture, where water sources are scarce, more than 200 soil moisture preservation teams have been formed and are carrying out a concentrated effort to roll and harrow the spring barren land. In areas with water sources, according to the order of water demand for various crops, the existing water is first used to irrigate wheat to promote early greening and more tillering. Secondly, it is used to meet the seeding water needs of early-maturing crops, and finally, it is used for the seeding needs of various field crops. In this way, the daily irrigation progress of wheat in the entire area has reached 500,000 mu. In order to make the existing water sources irrigate more land, many areas have adopted the method of "four waters (well water, river water, reservoir water, pit water) used together" and "three groups (machine group, waterwheel group, winch group) combined irrigation" to speed up the irrigation progress. Areas with more water sources have proposed a "one river, two wells, and three reservoirs" water use arrangement, first using river water and abundant well water with high infiltration and evaporation, and saving reservoir water.

Vigorously grasping the complementary nature of projects and machinery is another aspect of achieving more, faster, better, and more economical water use. In Shulu County's 2.05 million mu of cultivated land, more than 80% have achieved well-built canals, level land, gated channels, level and tidy fields, and wells with machinery, which significantly improves the spring irrigation speed. A flow rate irrigates about 1,000 mu per day, which is three to four times higher than last year. While grasping the matching of projects and machinery, all localities have paid special attention to equipping sufficient machine operators to truly achieve having machines and people to operate them. Xinle County has 681 irrigation and drainage machines, and now each machine is equipped with two to three operators, so that people can rest but the machines don't.

Organizing professional drought resistance teams and strengthening the leadership of these teams is another experience of all localities in using water more, faster, better, and more economically. At present, in addition to the general organization of spring irrigation professional teams, many areas have established special water management agencies. Communes have canal committees and canal protection teams, management districts have water conservancy sections, and production teams have contracted irrigation teams or groups, which carry out planned irrigation under unified leadership.

Carrying out large-scale cooperation in drought resistance is another important experience in irrigating water more, faster, and more economically. In Handan Prefecture, the cooperation of professional teams for high-yield cotton fields and high-yield wheat fields was organized. According to the unified water use plan, wheat was irrigated first, and then cotton fields were irrigated, which accelerated the wheat irrigation progress of the entire area by more than one time. In addition to organizing the cooperation of manpower and machinery, this area also carried out large-scale water source cooperation. Shexian County has 360,000 mu of winter-sown wheat this year, and the existing water sources can only irrigate more than 50,000 mu. A county-wide large-scale cooperation was carried out, organizing 1,200 waterwheels and 28 machines to form 25 water diversion lines, drilling holes through mountains and building bridges over ditches to lead water to mountain slopes more than 20 zhang high. 230,000 mu of wheat fields can be irrigated, and the irrigation benefits can be expanded four times.

Due to the implementation of the spirit of "more, faster, better, and more economically" in water use, the drought resistance movement in Hebei Province has resulted in over the past half month, spring irrigation of wheat reached more than 3.5 million mu and spring irrigation of barren land nearly 3 million mu in the southern Handan and Shijiazhuang areas alone, according to statistics.

    涓滴归田　抗住春旱　保证春播
    河北作好用水规划，开展人力机具大协作，春灌面积迅速增加
    本报天津27日电　河北省广大农村正在开展一个规模壮阔的防旱抗旱斗争。这个斗争突出的特点是各地都注意了“多快好省”的使用各种水源。
    河北省灌溉面积已达到了八千多万亩，蓄水也比去年多，水利机械比去年增加了一倍以上，但由于深翻地、方田化、肥料多，需水量也比去年更多，所以在积极扩大和发掘水源的同时，多快好省地用水，就成为当前防旱抗旱中的一个重要问题。
    各地为了多快好省地发挥现有水源的作用，都作好用水规划。根据墒情好坏和现有水源，按需水的轻重缓急，分类排队，作到多浇、省水。邯郸专区水源较少的西部山区，已经组成二百多个保墒专业队，正在突击轧耙春白地。在有水源地区，按各种农作物需水期的先后，将现有的水尽先用于浇麦，促其早返青、多分蘖，其次是满足早熟作物播种用水，最后用于各种大田作物的播种需要。这样以来，全区小麦日浇进度达到了五十万亩。为了使现有水源多浇地，很多地区采用了“四水（井水、河水、库水、坑水）齐用”，“三群（机器群、水车群、辘轳群）汇浇”的办法，加快了浇地进度。水源较多的地区，则提出了“一河二井三水库”的用水安排，先用渗透蒸发量大的河水和丰富的井水，节约库水。
    狠抓工程配套和机具配套，是作到多快好省用水的另一个方面。束鹿县二百零五万亩耕地，80％以上作到了渠成地平，渠道有闸，地平畦整，井有机具，显著的提高了春灌速度，一个流量每天浇地达到千亩左右，比去年提高了三、四倍。在抓工程、机具配套的同时，各地特别注意了配齐机手，真正作到有机具、有人开。新乐县有排灌机械六百八十一台，现在每台机器配齐了二至三名机手，作到了人歇机器不歇。
    组织防旱抗旱专业队伍，并加强对这支队伍的领导，是各地多快好省地用水的另一条经验。现在，各地除普遍组织了春灌专业队以外，不少地区都建立了水利专管机构，公社有渠道委员会、护渠队，管理区有水利股，生产队有包浇队或组，在统一领导下，有计划地浇水。
    开展防旱抗旱大协作，是多快好省浇水的又一个重要经验。在邯郸专区组织了棉田丰产方和小麦丰产方专业队的协作，根据统一用水的规划，先浇小麦，后灌棉田，使全区的浇麦进度加快了一倍多。除了组织人力、机具的协作之外，这个地区还开展了水源大协作。涉县今年冬播小麦有三十六万亩，现有水源只能浇五万多亩。开展了全县范围的大协作，组织了一千二百辆水车，二十八台机器，连成了二十五条引水线，遇山钻洞，遇沟架桥，将水引上二十多丈高的山坡，二十三万亩麦田都能浇上水，可扩大灌溉效益四倍。
    河北省的防旱抗旱运动，由于贯彻了多快好省用水的精神，半月来，仅南部邯郸、石家庄地区统计，春灌小麦已达到三百五十多万亩，春灌白地近三百万亩。
