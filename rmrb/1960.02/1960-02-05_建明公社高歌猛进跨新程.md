The Jianming Commune Advances Vigorously into a New Journey
		Initial Victory Achieved in Agricultural Technological Transformation After Two Months of Hard Work
		80% of Cultivated Land Achieves Irrigation; Mechanized Farming Accounts for 70%
		Electricity Installed in Eleven Villages; Chemical Fertilizer Plant with an Annual Output of 800 Tons Built

    This newspaper reports that the Jianming Commune in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, led by the famous labor model Wang Guofan, has achieved an initial victory in agricultural technological transformation after two months of hard work by all its members.
    A little over two months ago, the idea of "lights without oil, farming without oxen" was just a plan, but now it has become a reality. Currently, they have erected a 71-kilometer-long high-voltage line from Fengrun Cheng Pass in Tangshan City to the Jianming Commune. Eleven villages have already been equipped with electric lights, some factories have started using electricity for production, and some agricultural machinery is being powered by electricity. The completed 85-Li (approx. 42.5 km) of eighteen main and branch canals, have been installed with four electric pumping stations totaling 185 horsepower. Additionally, the Bai Mayu "Three Springs into One" project and the Sanlidian barrier dam project, along with many other small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, have expanded the irrigated area by more than 20,000 mu (approx. 3,300 acres). Together with the original irrigated area, over 80% of the commune's cultivated land has achieved irrigation. In terms of mechanization, the original five tractors, totaling 85 horsepower, have recently been increased by thirteen new tractors, totaling 465 horsepower. About 70% of the commune's land can now be cultivated by machines. Regarding fertilizer, the entire commune has accumulated over 560 million jin (280,000 tons) of crude fertilizer, averaging 12,000 jin (6 tons) per mu. To meet the need for chemical fertilizer, a synthetic ammonia fertilizer plant with an annual output of 800 tons has been built. With the rapid development of irrigation and mechanization, the entire commune has added four trucks, one hundred rubber-tired carts, and five hundred rubber-tired handcarts, realizing rubber-tired transportation throughout the commune.
    The high-speed realization of agricultural modernization in the Jianming Commune is a brilliant result of fully leveraging the superiority of the People's Commune and continuing to promote the glorious tradition of diligence and thrift in running the commune. For any construction project undertaken by this commune, they adhere to the spirit of raising funds themselves when there is no capital, finding materials themselves when there are no materials, and learning skills themselves when there are no technologies, independently solving all difficulties in the agricultural technological transformation. The state has supplied and will supply them with agricultural machinery and electrical equipment worth about 3.5 million yuan, but the ambitious Jianming Commune has quickly raised about 900,000 yuan by extracting public accumulation, member investment, and engaging in diversified operations, to repay the state. They put forward the slogan of "working hard for one year to pay off the machinery and electrical equipment costs" so that the state will have more adequate funds to help other fraternal communes. In addition, during the construction of various projects, they emphasized adapting to local conditions and using local materials to solve the supply of raw materials. In the high-speed development of irrigation and mechanization, when there were no technical personnel, the commune adopted methods such as inviting experts in to be teachers and sending people out to be apprentices, successively training more than 200 technicians such as tractor drivers, drivers, and electricians.
    In the process of carrying out agricultural technological transformation at high speed, this commune first and foremost focused on water conservancy construction. Regarding water conservancy construction, some people originally believed that mountain areas lacked water sources and conditions were poor, so they lacked confidence in achieving irrigation at high speed. To clarify the situation, the commune party committee focused on conducting surveys and found more than 100 water sources, which enhanced the commune members' confidence in water management. At the same time, it determined that the Bai Mayu "Three Springs into One" project (i.e., the convergence of the Changyushan’s Shuiyu, Eyu, and Dayu three free-flowing mountain springs into one place), the Sanlidian Zhahe Dam pumping station, and the Dongxiaozhai pumping station, etc. were key projects, and immediately organized labor to concentrate on the attack and accelerate the construction progress. In the Three Springs into One project, the entire commune originally planned to complete it in 50 days, but after the hard work of more than 1,000 commune members, it was completed in only 30 days.
    With agricultural technological transformation, the development of commune-run factories has been promoted. Currently, the newly established machinery, repair, rice and flour processing, and winemaking factories have already started production. This year during the Spring Festival, the commune members ate rice and flour processed by their own factories and drank wine made by themselves.

    建明公社高歌猛进跨新程
    奋战两月农业技术改造初获胜利
    耕地百分之八十实现水利化，机耕面积占百分之七十
    十一个村庄安上了电灯，建起了年产八百吨的化肥厂
    本报讯　著名劳动模范王国藩领导的河北遵化县建明公社，经过全体社员两个月来的奋战，已初步获得农业技术改造的胜利。
    在两个多月以前，“点灯不用油，耕地不用牛”还只是一个计划，现在已经把它变成了现实。目前，他们从唐山市的丰润城关到建明公社，架设起七十一公里的高压线路，已经有十一个村庄安上了电灯，部分工厂也开始用电力生产，一些农业机械开始用电力带动。已经完成的长达八十五华里的十八道干、支渠，安上了一百八十五马力的四座电力扬水机站，还有白马峪三泉合一的工程和三里店拦潜流筑坝工程，连同其它许多小型农田水利工程，共扩大浇地面积两万多亩，加上原来的水浇地面积，全社80％以上耕地实现了水利化。在机械化方面，原有拖拉机五台，计八十五马力，最近又新增加了十三台，共四百六十五马力，全社70％左右的土地从此得到机器耕种。在肥料方面，全社已积粗肥五亿六千多万斤，平均每亩已达到一万二千斤；为满足化学肥料的需要，兴建了一座年产八百吨的合成氨化肥厂。随着水利化、机械化的飞跃发展，全社新添置卡车四辆、胶轮车一百辆、胶轮小车五百辆，使全社实现了运输胶轮化。
    建明公社高速度地实现农业现代化，是充分发挥人民公社的优越性和继续发扬勤俭办社的光荣传统的光辉成果。这个公社举办任何建设事业，都是本着没有资金自己筹，没有物料自己凑，没有技术自己学的精神，自力更生地解决农业技术改造中的一切困难。国家供应和将供应他们价值约三百五十万元农业机械和电气设备，但是具有雄心壮志的建明公社，已经用提取公共积累、社员投资和搞多种经营等办法，很快筹集了约九十万元左右归还了国家。他们提出“苦干一年，还清机电价款”的口号，以便国家有更充足的资金帮助其他兄弟公社。此外，在各项工程施工当中，他们强调因地制宜就地取材解决原材料的供应问题。在水利化、机械化的高速度发展中，没有技术人材，公社便以请进来拜师傅，派出去当徒弟等办法，先后训练了二百多名拖拉机手、司机、电工等技术人材。
    这个公社在高速度地进行农业技术改造过程中，首先突出地抓紧水利建设。在水利建设上，原来有些人认为，山区水源缺乏，条件又不好，因此对高速度实现水利化信心不足。公社党委为了摸清底细，重点进行了勘查，发现水源一百多处，增强了社员治水信心。同时，确定了白马峪三泉合一（即长峪山的水峪、鹅峪、大峪三个自流山泉汇流一处），三里店闸河坝扬水站，东小寨扬水站等为重点工程，并立即组织劳力集中突击，加快了施工进度。全社在三泉合一工程中，原计划五十天完成，但经过一千多名社员的奋战，仅用三十多天的时间便完成了。
    随着农业技术改造，促进了社办工厂的发展。目前新办的机械、修配、米面加工、制酒等七个工厂，已经投入生产。今年春节，社员们吃到了自己工厂加工的米面，喝到了自己制造的酒。
