The fraternal countries are blooming with construction flowers in the New Year

*   A Batch of New Industrial Enterprises Have Been Completed and Put into Production in the Soviet Union This Year
*   The Volume of Capital Construction in Vietnam This Year Will Exceed the Sum of the Previous Two Years
*   The Scale of Construction in the Mongolian Capital is Enormous, and Industrial Output Will Have a Huge Increase
*   Romania Concentrates Its Efforts on Rapidly Constructing a Batch of Important Industrial Enterprises

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: Employees of the Soviet industrial capital construction sector are welcoming this year's construction tasks with soaring enthusiasm. A batch of new industrial enterprises have already been completed and put into production at the beginning of the year. The Kuznetsk Iron and Steel Combine in Siberia recently completed a giant coke oven. In Sverdlovsk, the first phase of a large woolen textile factory, one of the important projects of the Seven-Year Plan, was completed on January 3. Construction workers in Saratov completed a residential materials combine factory on January 5 that can produce 100,000 square meters of large paneling annually. Power station construction workers also began the new year with their new labor achievements. In the first week of this year, the South Ural Thermal Power Station in Chelyabinsk installed another generator with a generating capacity of 200,000 kilowatts; the largest thermal power station in Central Asia near Tashkent also installed a generator with a generating capacity of 100,000 kilowatts at the beginning of the year and began generating electricity.

In order to rapidly complete more industrial enterprises and other construction projects, Soviet construction workers are currently launching a socialist competition, striving to shorten construction periods, accelerate construction progress, and reduce construction costs. Construction workers in Moscow and the capitals of the various union republics, as well as other important construction sites, are actively participating in this competition.

In the Russian Federation, the Anokhin work team at the construction site of the Synthetic Rubber Factory in the Bashkir Autonomous Republic and the Maloilov work team at the construction site of the Synthetic Rubber Factory in Kuibyshev launched an initiative at the beginning of this year, deciding to complete the entire year's construction and installation plan ahead of schedule in August. This initiative has been responded to by construction workers in many regions of the country. In the Bashkir Autonomous Republic alone, there are currently six hundred construction work teams participating in the competition to complete this year's construction and installation work plan ahead of schedule.

Employees of construction enterprises in the Sverdlovsk Oblast have decided to complete the construction and installation plan for industrial enterprises ahead of schedule on December 25. Industrial enterprises such as the Nizhny Tagil Iron and Steel Combine in the Urals and the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant have decided to complete their annual plan for increasing production equipment capacity one month ahead of schedule.

Many construction workers at important industrial enterprises under construction have decided to greatly shorten the construction period and bring the enterprise into operation well in advance. For example, construction workers at the Second Krivoy Rog Ore Dressing Combine are determined to complete and put the factory into operation in November this year, which is one year ahead of the original plan. The Zhdanov Iron and Steel Combine originally planned to spend two and a half to three years building a large steel plate rolling mill. Now, the construction workers have decided to shorten the construction period by one year and complete it this year.

This newspaper reports that the scale of capital construction in North Vietnam in 1960 is enormous, with total investment increasing by 40.2% compared to 1959, and the workload will exceed the sum of the workloads in 1958 and 1959. According to the pre-determined plan of the Ministry of Construction, there are one hundred and ten new construction projects in 1960, of which sixty are industrial projects and fifty are civil projects.

This was said by Nguyen Khon, Vice Minister of the Vietnamese Ministry of Construction, recently in response to a question from a Vietnam News Agency reporter.

According to this year's plan, the Viet Tri Power Plant with a generating capacity of 16,000 kilowatts, the Ham Rong Power Plant in Thanh Hoa Province, the Lao Cai Apatite Plant with an annual output of 500,000 tons, and a chemical plant producing chemical raw materials will be completed this year. In order to meet the growing needs of capital construction, nine building materials manufacturing plants and a large number of handicraft workshops for building materials will also be started this year.

North Vietnam will also build many school buildings for universities and vocational schools this year, and will expand and build a number of hospitals, summer resorts and sanatoriums, and worker residential areas.

The tasks of the construction department this year are to continue to maintain and improve the speed of construction, pay attention to the advanced studies and training of construction personnel, improve work, and implement the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government's policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical, ensuring labor safety."

The design workload of this year's capital construction has doubled compared to 1959. All projects are required to have a higher technical level; some projects also require a certain artistic level.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 19th: This year, the construction of Ulaanbaatar, the capital of the Mongolian People's Republic, will develop rapidly, and its industrial production will increase by 42.9% compared to last year. Many new industrial enterprises will be put into production. It is estimated that its industrial output will account for 47.2% of the country's total industrial output this year.

This year, the scale of capital construction in Ulaanbaatar is huge. The state will allocate more than 152.2 million Tugriks (Mongolian currency) to expand the central thermal power plant and shoe factory, and build building materials joint manufacturing plants, printing plants, radio stations, etc.

The labor productivity of industrial enterprises in Ulaanbaatar is expected to increase by 13% this year, while the cost of industrial products will be reduced by 12%. In order to successfully complete these tasks, all industrial enterprises are striving to make the fullest use of production reserves, promote advanced experience, and actively apply new technologies to production.

Ulaanbaatar will also vigorously carry out municipal construction this year. The Youth Palace and the Post and Telecommunications Building will soon be completed, and many residential buildings are being built in the southern part of the city. In addition, the paving of asphalt roads, the installation and expansion of heating equipment, and the construction of water supply and drainage networks will also be completed this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest: This year, many important industrial projects in Romania will be put into production or start construction. The scale of capital construction will be larger than last year, and investment in capital construction will be more than 30% higher than last year. There are about four hundred investment projects above the quota alone.

This year's industrial capital construction projects are mainly concentrated in the steel, chemical, machinery manufacturing, and wood processing industries.

The main policy of capital construction is to rationally determine construction projects, minimize costs, concentrate the use of material and financial resources, shorten the construction period, and quickly put them into production.

High speed is a characteristic of Romania's capital construction this year. This year, it is stipulated that the construction period of large industrial projects generally does not exceed two years. In order to achieve this, design work will be improved, material and financial resources will be used in a concentrated manner, and the level of mechanization and factoryization of construction will be improved at the same time. A sugar factory in Craiova Oblast used to take four years to build, but a sugar factory of the same production scale can now be built in only one and a half years.

In this year's capital construction work, special attention is paid to reducing costs under the condition of ensuring quality, from design to construction. This year, the consumption of cement and steel bars will be reduced by 5%-8% compared to last year, and the consumption of wood will also be greatly reduced. Design work is the key to reducing the cost of enterprises. This year, attention will be paid to reducing some unnecessary engineering projects in the design work.

In addition to building new industrial projects this year, Romania will also expand and renovate some enterprises, and make full use of the original production area to increase high-efficiency machinery and equipment. This can save investment in the construction of new industrial projects.

    兄弟国家新春盛开建设花朵
    苏联今年已有一批新工业企业建成和投入生产
    越南今年基本建设工作量将超过前两年的总和
    蒙古首都建设规模巨大工业产量将有巨大增长
    罗马尼亚集中力量高速建设一批重要工业企业
    据新华社莫斯科电　苏联工业基本建设部门的职工以高涨的热情迎接今年的建设任务。一批新的工业企业已经在年初建成和投入生产。西伯利亚的库兹涅次克钢铁联合工厂最近建成了一座巨型炼焦炉。在斯维德洛夫斯克，七年计划的重要工程之一——一座大型毛纺工厂的第一期工程已在1月3日完工。萨拉托夫的建筑工人在1月5日建成了一座每年可以生产十万平方米大块板材的住宅材料联合工厂。电站建设工人也以自己的新的劳动成绩开始了新的一年。在今年的第一周内，车里雅宾斯克南乌拉尔热电站又安装了一台发电能力达二十万瓩的发电机；塔什干附近的中亚细亚最大的火力发电站也在年初安装了一台发电能力达十万瓩的发电机，并开始发电。
    为了使更多的工业企业和其他建筑工程迅速建成，苏联建筑工人目前正在展开社会主义竞赛，力争缩短建设期限、加快建设进度和降低建筑成本。莫斯科和各加盟共和国首都以及其他一些重要建筑工地的建筑工人，都积极参加了这一竞赛。
    在俄罗斯联邦，巴什基尔自治共和国合成橡胶工厂建筑工地上的阿诺兴工作队和古比雪夫的合成橡胶工厂建筑工地上的马洛伊洛夫工作队在今年年初提出倡议，决定在8月间就提前完成今年全年的建筑安装计划。这一倡议获得了全国许多地区的建筑工人的响应，单是巴什基尔自治共和国一地目前就有六百个建筑工作队参加了争取提前完成今年的建筑安装工作计划的竞赛。
    斯维德洛夫斯克州建筑企业的职工决定在12月25日提前完成工业企业的建筑安装计划。乌拉尔的下塔吉尔钢铁联合工厂、乌拉尔重型机器制造厂等工业企业决定要提前一个月完成增加生产设备能力的年度计划。
    许多正在建设的重要工业企业的建筑工人都决定要大大缩短建设期限，大大提前使企业落成和投入生产。例如，克里沃罗格第二选矿联合工厂的建筑工人决心在今年11月份就把工厂建成和投入生产，这比原定计划提前了一年。日丹诺夫钢铁联合工厂原计划用两年半到三年的时间建成大型钢板轧钢机，现在，建筑工人们决定把建筑期限缩短一年，使它在今年建成。
    本报讯　越南北方1960年的基本建设规模巨大，投资总额将比1959年增加40．2％，工作量将超过1958年和1959年工作量的总和。据建筑部的预定计划，1960年新的建设工程有一百一十项，其中六十项是工业工程、五十项是民用工程。
    这是越南建筑部副部长阮昆最近在答越南通讯社记者问时说的。
    根据今年的计划，在今年竣工的工程有发电能力为一万六千瓩的越池发电厂，清化省咸龙发电厂，年产五十万吨的老街磷灰石厂和生产化学原料的化工厂等。为了满足基本建设日益增长的需要，今年还将动工兴建九个建筑材料制造厂和大批建筑材料手工业工场。
    越南北方今年还将建筑许多高等学校和专业学校的校舍，并且将扩大和增建一批医院、避暑和疗养所、工人住宅区等。
    建筑部门今年的任务是，继续努力保持和提高施工速度，重视建筑人员的深造和培养，改进工作，并贯彻执行越南劳动党和政府关于“多快好省、保证劳动安全”的方针。
    今年的基本建设的设计工作量比1959年增加一倍。各项工程都要求具有更高的技术水平；有些工程还要求达到一定的美术水平。
    新华社乌兰巴托19日电　今年，蒙古人民共和国首都乌兰巴托的建设将获得迅速发展，它的工业生产将比去年增加42．9％，许多新的工业企业将投入生产，预计它的工业产量在今年将占全国工业总产量的47．2％。
    今年，乌兰巴托的基本建设规模巨大。国家将拨出一亿五千二百多万图格里克（蒙币）来扩建中央热电站和制鞋厂，修建建筑材料联合制造厂、印刷厂、无线电台等。
    乌兰巴托市工业企业的劳动生产率今年预定提高13％，而工业品的成本则将降低12％。为了顺利地完成这些任务，各工业企业单位都力求最充分地利用生产的后备力量，推广先进经验，积极地把新技术运用到生产中去。
    乌兰巴托市今年还将大力进行市政建设，青年宫和邮电大楼即将建成，在市区南部正在兴建许多住宅。此外，马路的铺柏油工程、设置和扩大暖气设备以及上下水道网等工程也将在今年完成。
    据新华社布加勒斯特电　今年，罗马尼亚将有许多重要工业项目投入生产或开始建设。基本建设规模将大于去年，基本建设投资比去年多30％以上。单是限额以上的投资就约有四百项。
    今年的工业基本建设项目主要集中在钢铁、化学、机器制造和木材加工等工业部门。
    基本建设的主要方针是合理地确定建设项目、尽量降低造价、集中使用物力财力，缩短施工期限，迅速投入生产。
    高速度是罗马尼亚今年基本建设的一个特点。今年规定，大型工业项目的施工期限一般都不超过两年。为了做到这点，将改进设计工作，集中使用物力财力，同时提高施工的机械化和工厂化的水平。克拉约发州的一个制糖厂过去是用四年时间建成的，但同样生产规模的制糖厂现在只需一年半就可以建成。
    在今年的基本建设工作中，从设计到施工都特别注意在保证质量的条件下降低造价。今年水泥和钢筋的消耗将比去年降低5％—8％，同时也要大大降低木材的消耗量。设计工作是降低企业造价的关键。今年在设计工作中将注意减少一些不必要的工程项目。
    罗马尼亚今年除了新建工业项目外，还要扩建和改建一些企业，尽量利用原有的生产面积，增加高效率的机器设备。这样就可以节约新工业项目的建设投资。
