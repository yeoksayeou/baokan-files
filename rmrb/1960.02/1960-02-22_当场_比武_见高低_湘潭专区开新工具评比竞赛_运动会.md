On-the-Spot "Contests" to Determine Superiority
    Xiangtan Prefecture Holds New Tool Evaluation and Competition "Games"
    (Reported by this newspaper) Xiangtan Prefecture in Hunan Province has created a new method for promoting the use of new tools in spring plowing production: the New Tool Evaluation and Competition "Games." The participants in the meeting were mainly skilled users of new tools such as rice transplanters, deep plows, and fodder choppers, selected from the communes and counties, as well as some cadres from counties and communes leading tool reforms. The skilled users of new tools competed in field operations, followed by discussions and experience sharing. At the meeting, there were also fierce clashes between advanced and conservative ideas, achieving a combination of practical discussion and theoretical analysis, with a novel format and lively content. At the end of the meeting, outstanding collectives and individuals who used new tools such as rice transplanters were selected.
    The "Games" themselves first shattered the conservative ideas of some people regarding the promotion of these three new tools and strengthened their confidence and determination to promote them. Zhang Wanying, a cadre in charge of promoting rice transplanters in the Da Yao Commune of Liuyang County, originally did not believe that rice transplanters could actually transplant rice seedlings, and was concerned that making rice transplanters and training rice transplanter operators would result in "losses of both people and money." This time, after she personally saw that the quality of the rice seedlings transplanted by the rice transplanter was very good, she gained confidence and motivation, and made a long-distance phone call to the commune overnight, requesting that rice transplanters be manufactured and rice transplanter operators be trained. Secondly, at the "Games," through competitions, everyone broadened their horizons, saw many strengths of others, studied diligently, and were determined to bring the skills they learned back.

    当场“比武”见高低
    湘潭专区开新工具评比竞赛“运动会”
    本报讯　湖南省湘潭专区在春耕生产中创造了推广使用新工具的新办法——新工具评比竞赛“运动大会”。参加会议的人，主要是经过公社和县层层选拔出来的使用插秧机、深耕犁、饲料切碎机等新工具的能手，以及一些县、公社领导工具改革的干部。使用新工具的能手们，在田间操作比武，然后进行讨论，交流经验；会上，先进思想和保守思想还有激烈的交锋，做到就实论虚，虚实并举，形式新颖，内容生动活泼。会议最后评选了使用插秧机等新工具的优秀集体和个人。
    “运动会”的本身，首先打破了某些人对推广这三种新工具的保守思想，坚定了推广的信心和决心。浏阳县大瑶公社负责推广插秧机的干部张完英，原来不相信插秧机真能插秧，耽心造插秧机、训练插秧机手会搞得“人财两空”。这次，她亲眼看到插秧机插的秧苗质量很好以后，就有了信心，鼓起了干劲，连夜打长途电话回公社，要求赶制插秧机和训练插秧机手。其次，在“运动会”上，通过比武，大家广开眼界，看到别人很多长处，勤学苦练，决心把学到的技术带回去。
