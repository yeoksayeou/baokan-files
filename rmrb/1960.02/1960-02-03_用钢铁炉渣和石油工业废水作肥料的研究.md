    With the high-speed development of industrial production, the amount of waste residue and wastewater has also greatly increased. In 1959, China's steel slag production was over 20 million tons. Some older large-scale steel plants have even larger quantities due to past accumulation, piling up like mountains, hindering the utilization of factory land, and becoming a problem urgently in need of a solution. Taking Fushun City as an example, the daily discharge of industrial wastewater exceeds 300,000 tons, polluting the nearby Hun River, causing the death of fish and shrimp, and affecting residents' drinking water. These industrial waste residues and wastewater contain a wealth of nutrients needed by plants. Although some contain small amounts of toxic substances, they can still be used by plants after appropriate treatment. The high-speed development of agricultural production in our country requires a large supply of fertilizer and the need to open up new fertilizer sources. Under the guidance of the Party's policy that scientific research should serve national production and construction, we have conducted some experiments on the effective utilization of steel slag and petroleum industrial wastewater. According to preliminary experimental results, steel slag and petroleum industrial wastewater have significant fertilizer effects on different crops in different regions. This opens up a very effective utilization path for the treatment of industrial waste residue and wastewater, and finds an inexhaustible source of mineral fertilizer for agricultural production.

    The Composition of Steel Slag and Petroleum Industrial Wastewater
    Steel slag is a waste material left over from the steel smelting process, and its composition varies depending on the ore and ingredients. It generally contains a large amount of silicon and calcium, medium amounts of iron, aluminum, and magnesium, small amounts of manganese and phosphorus, and trace amounts of copper, boron, molybdenum, and zinc. China's steel slag contains less phosphorus (although some contain more phosphorus), while trace elements such as copper and zinc are more abundant, which is the main difference from steel slag in some foreign regions. Steel slag not only contains a variety of nutrients needed by plants, but also because it has been subjected to high temperatures, the easily soluble part, that is, the part that can be absorbed by plants, accounts for about one-third to two-thirds.

    Petroleum industrial wastewater is the wastewater discharged from the oil shale refining process, including cooling and washing water, shale dry distillation water, water separated from petroleum, and waste acid water. Although these wastewaters are discharged after the recovery of ammonia and the recovery and refining of floating oil, they still contain a relatively large amount of nitrogen. Each liter contains an average of about 600 to 700 milligrams of nitrogen, and also contains small amounts of phosphorus and potassium. In addition, it also contains some toxic substances such as phenol and hydrogen sulfide.

    Utilization of Steel Slag and Industrial Wastewater as Fertilizer in Various Countries
    The use of open-hearth slag from steelmaking as fertilizer began in Western European countries in the second half of the last century. So-called Thomas phosphate fertilizer is a fertilizer made by the Englishman Thomas in 1887 by improving the Bessemer refining method to make the slag contain a certain amount of phosphorus and grinding it finely. As for the blast furnace slag from ironmaking, because it contains very little phosphorus but more silicon and calcium, the Japanese have used it in old paddy fields as silicon fertilizer to prevent lodging, with good results. It has also been verified by experiments that slag used as calcium fertilizer has a better fertilizer effect than ordinary lime, possibly due to the trace elements it contains, and therefore it is also used as an indirect fertilizer. Generally speaking, steelmaking slag has mainly been used as phosphate fertilizer in the past, while ironmaking slag has not been fully utilized and is often not introduced in general fertilizer books.

    In the treatment and utilization of industrial wastewater, socialist countries and capitalist countries follow two different paths and have achieved obviously different results. In capitalist countries, it was only when industrial wastewater seriously polluted water bodies that the government issued industrial wastewater discharge regulations. For example, the United States issued such regulations in 1948, stipulating that enterprises must discharge wastewater in accordance with national water quality standards, forcing capitalists to establish so-called artificial biochemical aeration fields to treat wastewater. Years of experience have proved that this treatment not only means that harmful wastewater still pollutes water bodies, but also fails to rationally utilize the beneficial substances in it.

    In socialist countries, the Soviet Union uses the method of irrigating farmland to purify wastewater. Through the biological and chemical effects of the soil on the wastewater, it can not only eliminate toxins, but also effectively utilize the beneficial components in it. In 1950, the area of land irrigated with wastewater near Moscow reached 4,000 hectares, among which the Stalin Collective Farm in 1949 was the first to realize the year-round use of wastewater to irrigate farmland, and vegetable production increased tenfold. Industrial and urban wastewater is both a water source and a fertilizer source. Comprehensive utilization provides a large amount of nutrient material basis for agricultural production.

    The Fertilizer Effect of Steel Slag
    Because China's steel slag contains less phosphorus, it has not been valued or even regarded as waste. In 1958, China's agricultural production achieved a great leap forward, and expanding fertilizer sources became a top priority. On the one hand, the Institute of Forestry and Soil Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences first conducted fertilizer effect experiments with Anshan Iron and Steel blast furnace slag in pots, and on the other hand, widely collected slag from various parts of the country for component analysis. Pot experiments have proved that blast furnace slag applied to albic soil has significant yield-increasing effects on crops such as wheat, soybeans, and sugar beets, and at the same time improves the quality of the products.

    In the winter of 1958, we continued to conduct pot experiments with wheat in greenhouses, and increased the types of soil and slag. The experimental results were also very good. For example, applying Anshan Iron and Steel blast furnace slag, Benxi Iron and Steel blast furnace slag, and Fushun Iron and Steel electric furnace slag to albic soil increased wheat yields by 61.7%, 66.1%, and 58.3% respectively. Applying Anshan Iron and Steel blast furnace slag to albic soil, brown forest soil, and light meadow soil increased wheat yields by 61.7%, 34.4%, and 9.5% respectively. This proves that not only do different slags in the same soil type have good effects, but also the same slag applied to different soil types has different levels of yield increase.

    In the summer of 1959, we conducted field fertilizer effect experiments with high and open-hearth slag on different crops in different soil types in Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces, and all achieved different degrees of yield increase. In particular, the addition of slag to paddy fields irrigated with industrial wastewater has a more significant effect on increasing rice production.

    Slag is not only effective for the current crop, but also for subsequent crops. We used albic soil and brown forest soil that had been planted with wheat in the winter of 1958, and then planted soybeans in the summer of 1959. Pot experiments showed that soybeans in the albic soil that had been previously treated with slag increased yields by 42%, and those in brown forest soil increased by 20.4%. This shows that slag does not need to be applied every year, but can be applied once every two or three years depending on the nature of the soil and the amount applied.

    Slag also has the effect of preventing crop lodging. We conducted fertilizer effect experiments with high and open-hearth slag on rice in paddy fields irrigated with petroleum wastewater in the Shangyou People's Commune in Lishizhai, Fushun. The results showed that the stalk strength increased by 44.5% with the application of blast furnace slag, and 28.5% with the application of open-hearth slag. This may be related to the fact that blast furnace slag contains more silicon and calcium than open-hearth slag, because these elements have the effect of strengthening cell membranes. Similar results were obtained in other pilot projects.

    In general, China's steel slag is a heat-treated compound fertilizer of silicon, calcium, and various trace elements. After our preliminary experiments, its effect is multifaceted, which can both improve the soil, increase the pH and base saturation, and supply a variety of plant nutrients. Calcium plays a greater role in strongly acidic soils, while silicon and trace elements play a greater role in other soils. Steel slag can meet the requirements of various soils and crops, and is a fertilizer with a wide range of applications. Moreover, the slag undergoes a heat treatment process, and part of the substance is easily soluble and becomes a quick-acting fertilizer, while another part of the substance is still a slow-acting fertilizer, so the after-effect is longer. Slag can be applied directly or mixed with organic compost and fermented before application. Slag can promote the biological action of compost, and compost can promote the conversion of slag, complementing each other for greater benefits. Slag contains more calcium and is an alkaline fertilizer, suitable for acidic and neutral soils. The amount of application should vary according to the soil acidity, and excessive application will also damage the soil.

    Although the experiments we have done have been verified by practice and confirmed its effect, and we believe that it can be promoted and applied, the effect of high and open-hearth slag on increasing yield and improving quality for various crops in various soils still needs more experiments. As for the pulverization of slag, if cold water quenching measures can be taken, it will be easier to solve.

    The Fertilizer Effect of Petroleum Industrial Wastewater
    Petroleum industrial wastewater contains a relatively large amount of nitrogen, and paddy fields irrigated with it have obtained a large amount of nitrogen source, and the yield increase effect is significant. The 11,300 mu of paddy fields irrigated with petroleum industrial wastewater in the Shangyou People's Commune in Fushun had an average yield of 890 jin per mu. The 255 mu of paddy fields irrigated with clean water and applied with 20 jin and 50 jin of ammonium sulfate respectively had average yields of 400 jin and 582 jin per mu respectively. This shows that petroleum industrial wastewater has a high nitrogen fertilizer benefit. However, because wastewater can only supply more nitrogen, the total nitrogen content of the soil that has been irrigated for a long time is as high as 0.27%, so that the nutrient combination is out of balance, which often causes the rice to grow excessively, lodge, and develop rice blast disease. Based on the above situation, we cooperated with the Liaoning Academy of Agricultural Sciences to conduct experiments on increasing the application of phosphorus, potassium, and steel slag in the Shangyou People's Commune, and achieved significant yield increases and lodging prevention effects in both new and old irrigated areas.

    The toxic substances contained in petroleum industrial wastewater have different effects depending on the content. If the phenol content in wastewater is within 125 milligrams per liter, it not only has a stimulating effect on rice growth, but also can inhibit the reproduction of weeds. The weeding work in wastewater irrigated fields can generally be reduced by more than half. The amount of sulfur in the wastewater is sufficient to cause the accumulation of hydrogen sulfide in the soil. The hydrogen sulfide content in the soil in the new wastewater irrigated area is 12.8 to 17 milligrams per 100 grams of air-dried soil, while the old wastewater irrigated area reaches 16.3 to 33.1 milligrams. This easily causes rice root rot.

    Petroleum industrial wastewater is a nitrogen-rich fertilizer source. However, how should it be applied in combination with phosphorus and potassium fertilizers to ensure the balanced supply of plant nutrients, what concentration of irrigation is most suitable, how to purify the toxic substances in wastewater, and what changes in physical, chemical, and biological properties are caused by irrigation into the soil, still need further experimental research.

    Using waste residue and wastewater as fertilizer, turning waste into gold, is a multi-benefit production measure. If all 20 million tons of steel slag produced in a year are used as fertilizer, calculated at 100 jin per mu, it can fertilize 400 million mu of land; if 200 jin per mu is applied, it can fertilize 200 million mu of land. With a 10% increase in rice production, it can increase rice production by 10 to 20 billion jin. The nitrogen content of petroleum industrial wastewater in Fushun City alone, calculated at an average of 600 to 700 milligrams of nitrogen per liter, the amount of nitrogen in the wastewater discharged each year is equivalent to the nitrogen fertilizer of about 230,000 tons of ammonium sulfate, which would require a fairly large-scale factory to produce such a large amount of nitrogen fertilizer. The industrial wastewater and urban sewage in major cities in China are extremely large and are very rich sources of fertilizer and water. Therefore, strengthening the research on steel slag and petroleum wastewater is an important task we face.

    用钢铁炉渣和石油工业废水作肥料的研究
    中国科学院林业土壤研究所所长　朱济藩

    随着工业生产高速度的发展，废渣废水数量也大大增加。1959年，我国钢铁炉渣产量在二千万吨以上。一些历史较久的大型钢铁厂，加上过去所积累的废渣，数量就更多，有的已堆积如山，妨碍厂地的利用，成为亟待处理的问题。工业废水以抚顺一市为例，每日排量超过三十万吨，排入附近浑河后，污染河水，以致鱼虾死亡，影响居民饮水。这些工业废渣废水中含有丰富的植物所需的各种养料。有的虽然含有少量的毒害物质，但是经过适当处理，仍可供植物利用。我国农业生产的高速度发展，需要大量肥料的补给，需要开辟新的肥源。在党的科学研究要为国家生产建设服务的方针指导下，我们对钢铁炉渣和石油工业废水的有效利用做了一些试验。根据初步试验的结果，钢铁炉渣和石油工业废水对不同地区的不同作物都有很显著的肥效。这就为工业废渣废水的处理开辟了一条极有效的利用途径，为农业生产找到了取之不尽，用之不竭的矿质肥料来源。
    钢铁炉渣和石油工业废水的成份
    钢铁炉渣是冶炼钢铁过程中遗留下来的废弃物质，所含成份因矿石与配料而不同。一般含有大量的硅和钙，中量的铁、铝、镁，少量的锰和磷，微量的铜、硼、钼、锌。我国钢铁炉渣含磷较少（也有少数含磷较多的），而微量元素中铜、锌较多，这是和国外若干地区钢铁炉渣主要不同之点。钢铁炉渣中不仅含有多种植物所需的养分，而且因为经过高温，易溶部分也就是可供植物吸收的部分约占三分之一到三分之二。
    石油工业废水是用油母页岩炼油过程中排出的废水，包括冷却洗涤用水，页岩干馏的水，石油中分离的水及废酸水。这些废水虽经氨的回收和浮油的收炼后排出，但仍含有较多量的氮素。每升中平均约含氮六百到七百毫克，并含有少量的磷、钾。此外，还含有一些酚和硫化氢等有毒物质。
    世界各国对钢铁炉渣和工业废水在肥料上的利用状况
    利用炼钢的平炉渣作为肥料，西欧国家在上世纪下半叶就已开始。所谓汤姆士磷肥，就是英人汤姆士1887年改良贝斯麦的提炼法，使炉渣中含有一定的磷量并磨细而成的肥料。至于炼铁的高炉渣，由于含磷很少，而含硅、钙较多，日本人曾在老水稻田中施用，当作硅肥，以防倒伏，效果很好。又经试验证实，炉渣当钙肥施用，肥效比一般石灰好，可能与所含微量元素有关，因而也有用做间接肥料的。总的说来，炼钢炉渣过去主要作为磷肥施用，而炼铁炉渣并未充分利用，一般肥料书籍中往往不予介绍。
    在工业废水的处理和利用上，社会主义国家和资本主义国家遵循着两条不同的道路，获得了显然不同的结果。在资本主义国家里，只是到了工业废水污染水体极为严重的时候，才由政府发布工业废水排放法令。例如，美国在1948年就发布了这样的法令，规定各企业要按照国家水质标准排放废水，使资本家不得不建立所谓人工生化曝气场来处理废水。多年经验证明，这样处理不仅有害废水仍是污染水体，而且不能合理地利用其中有益物质。
    在社会主义国家里，苏联采用灌溉农田方法来净化废水，通过土壤对废水的生物和化学的作用，不仅能够消除毒害，而且能有效地利用其中有益成分。1950年，莫斯科附近利用废水灌溉的土地面积达四千公顷，其中的斯大林集体农庄在1949年第一个实现全年利用废水灌溉农田，蔬菜产量增加了十倍。工业和城市废水既是水源又是肥源，综合利用，为农业生产提供大量的营养物质基础。
    钢铁炉渣的肥效
    我国钢铁炉渣因含磷较少，一直未被重视甚至看作废物。1958年我国农业生产获得了大跃进，扩大肥源成为当务之急。中国科学院林业土壤研究所一方面先用鞍钢高炉渣在盆钵中进行肥效试验，一方面广征国内各地炉渣进行成分分析。盆钵试验证明，高炉渣施用于白浆土中，对小麦、大豆、甜菜等作物都有显著的增产效果，同时提高了产品的质量。
    1958年冬，我们又在温室继续用小麦进行盆钵试验，并增加了土壤和炉渣种类，试验结果也很良好。如用鞍钢高炉渣、本钢高炉渣、抚钢电炉渣施于白浆土中，对小麦分别增产61．7％，66．1％和58．3％。鞍钢高炉渣施于白浆土、棕色森林土和浅色草甸土中，对小麦分别增产61．7％，34．4％和9．5％。证明不但在同一土类不同炉渣都有良好的效果，同时同一炉渣施于不同土类中，都有大小不等的增产作用。
    1959年夏，我们在辽宁、吉林、黑龙江等省不同土类对不同作物进行了高、平炉渣的大田肥效试验，都有不同程度的增产效果。特别是利用工业废水灌溉的水田，加施炉渣，对水稻的增产效果更为显著。
    炉渣不但对当槎作物有效，对后槎作物也有效。我们用1958年冬原种过小麦的白浆土和棕色森林土，1959年夏再种大豆，盆钵试验结果表明，原施炉渣的白浆土大豆增产42％，棕色森林土增产20．4％。可见炉渣无须年年施用，可按土壤的性质和施用量的大小而隔二、三年施用一次。
    炉渣还具有防止作物倒伏的作用。我们在抚顺李石寨上游人民公社用石油废水灌溉的水田内，进行了高、平炉渣对水稻的肥效试验，结果表明施高炉渣的基秆强度增加44．5％，施平炉渣的增加28．5％，这可能与高炉渣中所含硅、钙比平炉渣高有关。因为这些元素都有增强细胞膜的效用。在其它试点中也获得类似的结果。
    总的说来，我国钢铁炉渣是一种热制的硅、钙及多种微量元素的复合肥料。经过我们初步试验，它的效用是多方面的，既能改良土壤，提高酸碱度和盐基饱和度，又能供给多种植物养料。对酸性较强的土壤，钙的作用较大，对其他土壤，硅及微量元素的作用较大。钢铁炉渣能够适合多种土壤多种作物的要求，是一种应用范围较广的肥料。并且炉渣经过热制过程，一部分物质易溶，成为速效肥，而另一部分物质仍为迟效肥，所以后效较长。炉渣可以直接施用也可以与有机堆肥混合腐熟后施用。炉渣能促进堆肥的生物作用，堆肥能促进炉渣的转化，相辅相成，效益更大。炉渣含钙较多，是一种碱性肥料，适宜于酸性和中性土壤。在施用量上，要按照土壤酸度有所不同，施用过多也要损害土壤。
    我们所做的试验，虽经实践验证，肯定了它的效果，认为可以推广施用，但高、平炉渣在各种土壤对各种作物增加产量提高质量的作用，仍须进行更多的试验。至于炉渣的粉碎问题，如能采取冷水激碎措施，就更易解决。
    石油工业废水的肥效
    石油工业废水中含有较多量的氮素，用它灌溉的水稻田都获得了大量的氮源，增产效果显著。抚顺上游人民公社用石油工业废水灌溉的一万一千三百亩水稻田，平均亩产八百九十斤。而用清水灌溉分别加施二十斤和五十斤硫铵的二百五十五亩水稻田，分别平均亩产四百斤和五百八十二斤。这说明石油工业废水具有较高的氮肥效益。但因废水仅能供应较多的氮素，其中经长期灌溉的土壤全氮量高达0．27％，以致养分配合失去平衡，往往引起水稻的贪青倒伏与发生稻热病。根据上述情况，我们与辽宁农业科学院合作，在抚顺上游人民公社进行了增施磷、钾及钢铁炉渣试验，在新老灌区都获得了显著的增产与防止倒伏的效果。
    石油工业废水中所含的毒害物质，随着含量的不同产生的影响也不同。废水中含酚量每升在一百二十五毫克以内的，不但对水稻生长有刺激作用，还可以抑制杂草的繁殖。一般废水灌溉田中除草工作可以减轻一半以上。废水中含硫量足以引起土壤中硫化氢含量的累积，新废水灌区土壤中硫化氢含量每百克风干土为十二点八至十七毫克，而老废水灌区达十六点三至三十三点一毫克。这样就容易引起水稻根腐病。
    石油工业废水是一种含氮较丰的肥源。但是究竟应该如何与磷、钾肥料配合施用，保证植物养分的供应平衡，采用何种浓度灌溉最为适宜，废水中的毒害物质如何净化，以及灌入土壤中所引起的物理、化学、生物性质的变化等，也还有待于进一步的试验研究。
    利用废渣废水作肥料，废物变黄金，是一举多得的生产措施。如果把一年出产的二千万吨钢铁炉渣全部用做肥料，以每亩施用一百斤计算，可肥田四亿亩，每亩施用二百斤可肥田二亿亩，以水稻增产10％计，就可增产稻谷一百到二百亿斤。抚顺一市的石油工业废水含氮量以一升中平均含六百到七百毫克计，每年排出的废水中含氮量约相当于二十三万吨硫铵的氮肥，要相当大规模的工厂才能制成这样大量的氮肥。我国各大城市的工业废水再加上城市污水，为数极大，是非常丰富的肥源和水源。因此，加强对钢铁炉渣和石油废水的研究，是我们所面临的重要任务。
