Developing the production of ginger, scallions, and garlic has received special attention in Shandong's vigorous development of vegetable production. This practice is entirely correct. Ginger, scallions, and garlic are not only essential and important condiments in people's daily lives but also medicinal and industrial raw materials. With the people's living standards improving daily, vigorous development of these three products becomes even more important.

It is understood that many provinces and cities have increased the planting area of ginger, scallions, and garlic to some extent this year. To ensure the realization of the production increase plan, it is currently urgent to implement the production plan down to the communes and production teams without missing the agricultural season, and to make arrangements for land, labor, and seeds, so as not to be squeezed out. Vigorously promoting intercropping or crop rotation of ginger, scallions, and garlic with grain, cotton, and other crops to improve land utilization is a good way to achieve the expansion plan. Effectively solving the difficulty of insufficient seeds is also an important condition for ensuring the planting area. Regions with experience in producing ginger, scallions, and garlic should further increase the yield per unit area of these crops on the basis of expanding planting, so as to supply more products to meet the needs of various regions.

    多种姜、葱、蒜
    山东在大力发展蔬菜生产中，特别注意了发展生姜、大葱、大蒜生产。这个作法是完全正确的。姜、葱、蒜不仅是人民日常生活中不可缺少的重要的调味品，还是医药和工业原料。在人民生活水平日益提高的情况下，大力发展这三种产品显得更加重要。
    据了解，许多省市今年的姜、葱、蒜的种植面积都有一定的增加。为了保证增产计划的实现，目前急需不误农时地把生产计划落实到公社和生产队，做好土地、劳力、种子的安排，以免被挤掉。大力推广姜、葱、蒜与粮、棉等作物套种或轮作，提高土地利用率，是实现扩种计划的一个好办法。切实解决种子不足的困难，又是保证种植面积的一个重要条件。某些生产姜、葱、蒜有经验的地区，更应该在扩大种植的基础上，进一步提高这几项作物的单位产量，以便有更多的产品供应各地需要。
