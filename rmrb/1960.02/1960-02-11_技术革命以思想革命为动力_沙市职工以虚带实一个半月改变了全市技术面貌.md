Technical Revolution is Motivated by Ideological Revolution
    Shashi Workers Change the City's Technical Landscape in One and a Half Months by "Substituting the Abstract for the Concrete"

    (Our newspaper, Wuhan, 10th) The workers of Shashi, Hubei Province, adhering to the principle of taking ideological revolution as the driving force of technical revolution, created 501 types of indigenous and foreign mechanical equipment in a month and a half of concentrated effort. This led to the widespread realization of mechanization and semi-mechanization of heavy manual labor (such as carrying, lifting, chopping, mixing, swinging sledgehammers, etc.) and manual operations (such as washing, dyeing, scraping, cutting, sawing, chiseling, nailing, etc.), increasing efficiency by one to forty times respectively. At the same time, it saved 4,656 laborers, and the average labor productivity of workers increased by 17%. Factories and enterprises in the city completed their January production plans five days ahead of schedule.

    Shashi is a city with a population of over 100,000 under the Jingzhou Special District of Hubei Province, with a very weak technical foundation. Among the more than 20,000 workers in the city's industry and transportation sectors, 45.3% were engaged in manual labor, and 18.2% were engaged in heavy manual labor. In order to achieve a sustained great leap forward in 1960, and to ensure the launch of new and expanded projects without increasing the labor force, the Shashi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China launched a campaign of technical innovation and technical revolution among the city's workers in mid-December last year. This campaign aimed to eliminate heavy manual labor and reduce manual labor, and to realize mechanization and semi-mechanization. More than 80% of the city's workers participated in the campaign. Workers, technicians, salespersons, cleaners, cooks, and people from all walks of life enthusiastically engaged in innovation. In a short period of time, they put forward more than 27,000 rationalization proposals, and overcame more than 2,590 key problems. This allowed the city's forgers to discard their sledgehammers, carpenters to discard their hand planes, hand axes, and hand saws, dock transport workers to put down their carrying poles, and knitwear factory workers to realize six automatic processes (changing yarn, cutting heads, joining heads, taking off socks, sewing mouths, and lighting signal lights, etc.). Dyeing and finishing factories and iron and wood furniture factories also achieved continuous processes. Of the 352 canteens in the city, 70% used universal steam stoves to steam rice, stir-fry dishes, and boil water, shortening cooks' daily working hours by more than five hours and reducing the number of personnel by nearly one-sixth. Barbers in barber shops also sit on their own created mobile work chairs to cut hair. As workers have been freed from the heavy manual labor passed down from generations, transport workers sing: "In the past, carrying poles weighed on people's shoulders, now carrying poles sleep in front of the furnace, what use is there for thousands of troops for lifting and carrying, praise poems behind the driving car."

    The technical innovation and technical revolution movement under the leadership of the Shashi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has always followed the guiding ideology of "technical revolution taking ideological revolution as the driving force," and has launched a climax of studying Chairman Mao's thought throughout the city. Cadres and workers in the city organized more than 1,800 study groups and conscientiously studied Chairman Mao's works. At the beginning of the movement, they mainly studied Chairman Mao's works on how to treat new things. After the initial success of the battle, they studied Chairman Mao's articles on the theory of continuous revolution and the theory of revolutionary stages. The workers' enthusiasm for learning was high, with more than 79,000 workers attending classes, and their ideological level was generally improved. The Chen Quan'ying group in the fine spinning workshop of the Shashi Cotton Mill adopted the method of studying, examining their thoughts, and connecting with reality in the study of Mao Zedong Thought, which greatly improved their ideological awareness. They recalled that in the past, in order to prevent oil flowers and white flowers from mixing together, they had adopted the advanced method of separating oil flowers and putting them into bags, but they did not persist in using it. Everyone said that this was mainly due to the lack of Chairman Mao's thought of enthusiastically supporting new things, and they did not dare to persist after hearing a few sarcastic remarks. After everyone's thinking improved, they immediately restored the method of separating and bagging, putting the oil flowers separately, and no longer throwing the returned flowers on the ground.

    In order to consolidate and develop the results of the technical innovation battle at any time, the secretary of the Shashi Municipal Committee personally organized three large-scale inspection activities to select, finalize, match, and organize the promotion of the innovative projects in a timely manner. At the same time, in response to a series of changes caused by production reform within enterprises, they fully mobilized personnel from various departments to go deep into production, adjusted labor organization in a timely manner, reformed management work, and established new management systems.

    技术革命以思想革命为动力
    沙市职工以虚带实一个半月改变了全市技术面貌
    本报武汉10日电　湖北省沙市职工坚持以思想革命作为技术革命的动力，在一个半月的攻关战役中，创造出土、洋机械设备五百零一种，使笨重体力劳动（如：扛、挑、抬、砍、搅拌、抡大锤等）和手工操作（如：洗、染、刮、剪、锯、凿、钉等）普遍实现机械化、半机械化，分别提高工效一倍至四十倍，同时节约劳动力四千六百五十六人，工人劳动生产率平均提高17％。全市工厂企业提前五天完成1月份生产计划。
    沙市是湖北省荆州专区所属的一个十多万人的城市，技术基础非常薄弱。在全市工业交通二万多名职工中，从事手工操作的工人占45．3％，从事笨重体力劳动的工人占18．2％。为了实现1960年持续大跃进，并在不增加劳动力的情况下保证新建和扩建项目上马，中共沙市市委自去年12月中旬起，发动全市职工开展技术革新和技术革命的攻关战役，消灭笨重体力劳动和减少手工劳动，实现机械化半机械化。全市80％以上的职工都参加了攻关战役，工人、技术人员、营业员、清洁员、炊事员等各行各业的人都热情地闹起革新来，短短时间便提出了合理化建议二万七千多项，攻破了关键两千五百九十多个，使全市锻工丢掉了大锤，木工丢掉了手刨、手斧、手锯，码头运输工人放下了扁担，针织厂工人实现了六项自动（换纱、割头、接头、下袜、缝口、亮信号灯等），染整厂和铁木家俱厂还实现了工序连续化。全市三百五十二个食堂中，有70％利用了万能蒸气灶蒸饭、炒菜、烧水，使炊事员每天的工作时间缩短五小时以上，并减少了近六分之一的人员。大理发店的理发员也是坐在自己创造的活动工作椅上替人理发。由于职工们摆脱了祖祖辈辈传下来的笨重体力劳动，运输工人唱道：“从前扁担压人肩，现在扁担睡炉前，抬挑何用千军卒，行车后面颂诗篇。”
    在沙市市委领导下的技术革新和技术革命运动，自始至终遵循着“技术革命以思想革命为动力”的指导思想，在全市掀起学习毛主席思想的高潮。全市干部、职工共组织了一千八百多个学习小组，认真学习毛主席的著作。运动开始，他们主要学习了毛主席的有关如何对待新生事物的著作，战役初获成绩后，又学习毛主席关于不断革命论和革命阶段论的文章。工人们学习热情高涨，听课的职工达到七万九千多人次，普遍提高了思想水平。沙市纱厂细纱车间陈全英小组在学习毛泽东思想中，采取边学习边检查思想边联系实际的办法，大大提高了思想认识水平。她们回忆到过去为了不使油花和白花混在一起，曾经采取了先进的油花分清装袋法，但没坚持使用。大家说，这主要是由于缺乏毛主席那样热情支持新生事物的思想，听到两句风凉话便不敢坚持了。大家思想提高后，立即恢复了分清装袋法，把油花另外装起来，回花也不再丢在地下。
    为了随时巩固和发展技术革新战果，沙市市委书记亲自组织了三次规模较大的检查活动，对革新的项目及时进行选型、定型、配套、组织推广等工作。同时，他们还针对由于生产改革而在企业内部引起了一系列的变化，充分发动科室人员深入生产，及时调整劳动组织，改革管理工作，建立新的管理制度。
