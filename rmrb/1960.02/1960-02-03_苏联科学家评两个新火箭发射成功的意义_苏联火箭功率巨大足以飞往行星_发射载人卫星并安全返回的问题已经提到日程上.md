Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Soviet scientists have issued statements and articles commenting on the great significance of the successful launch of two multi-stage ballistic rockets into the Pacific region.

Professor Pokrovsky, a prominent Soviet rocket technology expert, told a TASS reporter that the multi-stage ballistic rocket launched again by the Soviet Union on January 31 proves that the automatic control system manufactured by the Soviet Union is absolutely reliable and stable. The large and heavy structure of the multi-stage rocket has excellently withstood the strength test.

He said that now it is possible to make some summaries of the development of Soviet rocket technology. Unprecedentedly huge achievements have been made in this field in the past two years. The power of the rocket engine is many times greater than some of the world's largest hydropower stations—the Volga Hydroelectric Station (2.3 million kilowatts) and the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station (4.5 million kilowatts) and the Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Station (6 million kilowatts) which are being built in Siberia.

He pointed out that the rocket engines manufactured by Soviet engineers and scientists are characterized not only by their enormous power, but also by their relatively light weight. They can reach a cosmic speed of about twelve kilometers per second, which is sufficient to fly to some of the planets closest to Earth.

Pokrovsky said that the Soviet Union's launch of rockets into the Pacific is undoubtedly a decisive stage, enabling us to realize the first interplanetary flight more quickly.

Academician Wolfkovich, a famous Soviet chemist, told a TASS reporter on February 1 that the successful launch of two multi-stage ballistic rockets into the Pacific region has opened up realistic prospects for the establishment of a new scientific department—experimental cosmic physics and chemistry.

Wolfkovich emphasized that these two launches once again demonstrated the unique achievements of the Soviet Union in rocket technology. He said that launching spacecraft towards Mars, Venus and other planets in the solar system will give us the first opportunity to study their nature and investigate the physical and chemical processes that occur in the universe. Previously, we could only obtain very little knowledge about this from spectroscopic materials, and it was incorrect in many ways.

Wolfkovich pointed out that the foundation for the development of astrochemistry was laid by the outstanding Russian scientist, Honorary Academician Bagura Morozov (1854-1946). He and Tsiolkovsky pioneered the path of in-depth exploration of celestial bodies.

He also pointed out that using experimental methods to verify Morozov's hypothesis about the origin of comets has also gained realistic prospects. Studying comets using cosmic laboratories will show whether their formation is, as Morozov believed, the result of solar gas ejected into interplanetary space.

The famous Soviet scientist Dobronravov published an article in "Red Star" saying that the Soviet Union's successful test of powerful ballistic rockets is an important contribution to further research into the universe. It opens up new prospects for launching interplanetary rockets. In the heavier artificial satellites to be launched in the future, devices that can ensure the satellite's unchanged direction in outer space will be installed, which can complete more accurate scientific observations. Heavy satellites may also be equipped with jet engines with reserve fuel to use for braking when they re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. The satellite can also be equipped with devices that ensure its safe return to the Earth's surface and landing at a specified location. The problem of building artificial satellites capable of carrying people and returning them safely to the ground has been put on the agenda.

Dobronravov also said that using heavy satellites and rockets will enable us to obtain more detailed photos of the moon and other planets near the earth.

Soviet cosmonautics expert Valvarov wrote in the Soviet "Komsomolskaya Pravda": Due to the further development of rocket engines and control systems, it is now possible to manufacture artificial satellites weighing several tons. After the weight of the artificial satellite increases, the number of various scientific instruments loaded on the satellite can be greatly increased. Complex astronomical instruments, such as telescopes and radio telescopes, can also be installed on the satellite. The photos taken by the satellite can be packaged in dry plate boxes and sent back to the ground, or transmitted back to the ground like the Soviet third cosmic rocket transmitted photos of the far side of the moon.

Valvarov also said that heavy artificial satellites open up prospects for solving the problem of television transmission on a global scale. Just three artificial satellites equipped with television receiving and transmitting equipment are enough to allow all countries on earth to exchange television programs with each other. Valvarov believes that heavy artificial satellites can play a huge role in weather forecasting. They can orbit the Earth in one and a half to two hours, recording climate conditions in vast areas, so that accurate long-term weather forecasts can be made.

"Komsomolskaya Pravda" also published an article by the famous Ukrainian biologist Nikitin. While praising the successful testing of the Soviet Union's powerful multi-stage ballistic rocket, he expressed the hope that people will soon be able to reach Mars and Venus, the planets in the solar system where life is most likely to exist. Soviet biologists foresee that interplanetary flights will begin soon in order to greatly expand human knowledge about various life forms, about its unlimited diversity, and about how life adapts to the special conditions of other worlds. Nikitin believes that extremely rich natural "museums" can be found in the universe to more deeply understand the forms of evolutionary development and discover its causes. Nikitin emphasized that modern physiology is currently approaching the opening of a new chapter, namely the study of life in conditions of weightlessness and periodic huge acceleration and deceleration in outer space.

    苏联科学家评两个新火箭发射成功的意义
    苏联火箭功率巨大足以飞往行星
    发射载人卫星并安全返回的问题已经提到日程上
    据新华社讯　苏联科学家纷纷发表谈话或文章，评论两个多级弹道火箭向太平洋区域发射成功的重大意义。
    苏联著名火箭技术专家波克罗夫斯基教授对塔斯社记者说，苏联在1月31日再次发射的多级弹道火箭证明，苏联制造的自动控制系统是绝对可靠和稳妥的。多级火箭的大而重的结构出色地经受住了强度试验。
    他说，现在已经可以就苏联火箭技术的发展做出某些总结了。最近两年来在这方面取得了空前巨大的成就。火箭发动机功率比一些世界上最大的水电站——伏尔加水电站（二百三十万瓩）和正在西伯利亚兴建的布拉次克水电站（四百五十万瓩）和克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站（六百万瓩）还要大许多倍。
    他指出，苏联工程师和科学家所制造的火箭发动机的特点，不仅是功率巨大，而且还比较轻巧。它们能达到每秒约十二公里的宇宙速度，足以飞往离地球最近的一些行星。
    波克罗夫斯基说，苏联往太平洋发射火箭一事，毫无疑问是一个决定性阶段，使我们可以更快地实现第一次行星际飞行。
    苏联著名化学家沃尔夫科维奇院士1日对塔斯社记者说，苏联两多个级弹道火箭向太平洋区域发射成功，为建立新的科学部门——实验宇宙物理学和化学，展开了现实的前景。
    沃尔夫科维奇强调指出，这两次发射再一次显示了苏联在火箭技术方面独一无二的成就。他说，向火星、金星和太阳系其它行星方向发射宇宙飞船，将使我们第一次有可能研究它们的自然界，考察在宇宙中发生的物理化学过程，而在这以前，我们根据光谱学材料所能获得的有关这方面的知识是非常少的，并且在许多方面是不正确的。
    沃尔夫科维奇指出，奠定天体化学发展基础的是杰出的俄罗斯科学家巴古拉·莫罗佐夫名誉院士（1854年—1946年）。他同齐奥尔科夫斯基一起开辟了深入探索天体的道路。
    他还指出，用实验的方法来验证莫罗佐夫关于慧星起源的假说，也获得了现实的前景。利用宇宙实验室研究慧星，将会表明它们的形成是不是像莫罗佐夫所认为的，是太阳气体喷入行星际空间的结果。
    苏联著名科学家多勃隆拉沃夫在“红星报”上发表文章说，苏联成功地试验强大的弹道火箭，是对进一步研究宇宙的重要贡献。它为发射行星际间火箭打开了新的前景。在今后将发射的更重的人造卫星中，将安装能够保证卫星在宇宙空间不变方向的装置，这就可以完成更精确的科学观察。在重型卫星中还可能安装带有后备燃料的喷气发动机，以便在它重新进入地球大气层时作制动用。卫星上还可以装置能保证它自己安全地返回地球表面时在规定的地点着陆的装置。建造能够载人的人造卫星并使它安全返回地面的问题已经提到日程上来了。
    多勃隆拉沃夫还说，利用重型卫星和火箭，将能获得更详细的月球照片和邻近地球的其他行星的照片。
    苏联宇宙航行专家瓦尔瓦罗夫在苏联“共青团真理报”上写道：由于火箭发动机和控制系统获得了进一步的发展，现在已经可以制造几吨重的人造卫星了。人造卫星的重量增加后，便可以大大增加卫星上装载的各种科学仪器的数量。卫星上还可以装置复杂的天文仪器，如望远镜和射电望远镜。卫星上拍摄的照片，可用干板盒装好送回地面，或像苏联第三个宇宙火箭传送月球背面照片那样传回地面。
    瓦尔瓦罗夫还说，重型人造卫星开辟了解决在世界范围内传播电视问题的前景。只要有三个装有电视接收和传播设备的人造卫星，就足以使地球上所有国家之间互相交换电视节目了。瓦尔瓦罗夫认为，重型人造卫星在气象预报方面能发生巨大的作用。它们在一小时半到二小时的时间内就能绕地球一周，记录广大地区的气候情况，这样，便能作出在长时期内的精确天气预报。
    “共青团真理报”还刊登了著名的乌克兰生物学家尼基京的文章。他在赞扬苏联强大的多级弹道火箭试验成功时表示希望，不久人就能到达太阳系行星中最有可能存在生物的火星和金星上去，苏联生物学家预见，不久将开始行星际飞行，以便大大扩大人类关于各种生命形式、关于它的无限制的多样性和有关生命如何适应别的世界的特殊条件的知识。尼基京认为，在宇宙中能够找到极其丰富的自然“博物馆”，以更深刻地了解进化发展的形式并发现它的原因。尼基京着重指出，现代生理学目前已接近揭开它新的一章，即研究关于在失重和在宇宙空间中周期性的巨大加速和减速条件下生活的情况的一章。
