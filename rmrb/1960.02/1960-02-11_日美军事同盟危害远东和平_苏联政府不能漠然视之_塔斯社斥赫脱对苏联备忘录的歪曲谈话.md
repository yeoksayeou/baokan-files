    Xinhua News Agency, February 10th: TASS Moscow, February 9th - TASS commentator Kharikov said that U.S. Secretary of State Herter recently made remarks regarding the Soviet government's memorandum to the Japanese government concerning the military treaty signed between Japan and the United States. The spirit of this talk was to support the position of the Japanese government. Herter tried his best to defend the position of the Japanese government, attempting to support the advocates of a military alliance with the United States and encourage them to approve the treaty as soon as possible.

    Kharikov said that, as everyone knows, in the Soviet government's memorandum, the Soviet government pointed out that the U.S.-Japan military treaty signed on January 19th is contrary to the interests of safeguarding peace in the Far East, and the Japanese government bears serious responsibility for all the consequences of this step. However, the U.S. Secretary of State arbitrarily interpreted the Soviet warning to the Japanese ruling clique, insisting that "the Soviet memorandum attempts to cast doubt on the Japanese people's right to safeguard their own national defense." Kharikov said that this statement does not conform to reality.

    Kharikov continued, the problem is that the U.S.-Japan military treaty has nothing in common with Japan's national defense rights, because this treaty is not intended to guarantee national security at all; on the contrary, it exacerbates the threat of dragging Japan into military conflicts.

    This treaty imposes new military obligations on Japan that harm Japan's rights as a sovereign state and cause Japan to lose its independence.

    If we are to talk about the rights of the Japanese people, then the Japanese government, in signing the treaty with the United States, has not taken into account the will of the majority of the people. This is evidenced by the massive actions involving millions of Japanese people who are opposed to the signing of this treaty.

    Kharikov said that Herter instigated the Japanese ruling clique, joining them in repeating the cliché that the Soviet memorandum was "interfering in Japan's internal affairs." Is it interference for the Soviet Union, whose national interests are harmed by the U.S.-Japan military treaty, to express its own opinion? The Soviet Union naturally cannot remain indifferent to such steps as the U.S.-Japan military alliance, which hinders the development of Soviet-Japanese relations and undermines the foundations of peace in the Far East. If we talk about interference, then this is first and foremost American pressure and interference.

    Kharikov pointed out that Herter's argument that the Soviet Union is threatening Japan is also groundless. Japan is in a serious situation because it has turned its territory into a foreign military base. The Soviet Union, as Japan's close neighbor, cannot fail to notice this.

    Kharikov wrote that Herter attempted to distort the Soviet Union's position on the Habomai Islands and Shikotan Island. He even said that this position was distressing. However, it is clearly stated in the memorandum that the Soviet Union cannot contribute to a situation where the territory used by foreign troops is further expanded by transferring the aforementioned islands to Japan.

    What is particularly strange about Mr. Herter's distress is that, as everyone knows, the United States has not yet returned Okinawa Island, which has belonged to Japan since ancient times, to Japan, but has used it as its own military base. Who can guarantee that the Habomai Islands and Shikotan Island will not suffer the same fate, that is, be occupied by the U.S. military?

    Kharikov concluded by saying that Herter attempted to find some contradiction between the Soviet Union's attitude towards Japan and the Soviet government's desire to ease international tensions. This is truly an attempt to blame others. Everyone knows that the conclusion of the U.S.-Japan military treaty cannot be regarded as an action to ease international tensions at all.

### 日美军事同盟危害远东和平  苏联政府不能漠然视之  塔斯社斥赫脱对苏联备忘录的歪曲谈话

    日美军事同盟危害远东和平
    苏联政府不能漠然视之
    塔斯社斥赫脱对苏联备忘录的歪曲谈话
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科9日讯：塔斯社评论员哈里科夫说，美国国务卿赫脱最近曾就苏联政府关于日本和美国签订军事条约给日本政府的备忘录一事发表了谈话。这个谈话的精神是支持日本政府的立场的。赫脱尽力为日本政府的立场辩护，企图以此支持同美国建立军事同盟的拥护者，并鼓励他们尽快批准这个条约。
    哈里科夫说，大家知道，在苏联政府的这个备忘录中，苏联政府指出，1月19日签订的日美军事条约是违背保障远东和平的利益的，日本政府对所采取的这一步骤的一切后果负有严重的责任。但是，美国国务卿竟任意解释苏联对日本统治集团的警告，硬说什么“苏联的备忘录企图使日本人民保障自己国防的权利受到怀疑”。哈里科夫说，这种说法是不符合实际情况的。
    哈里科夫接着说，问题在于：日美军事条约同日本的民族防御权毫无共同之处，因为这个条约根本不是为了保障国家的安全，相反地，它加剧了把日本拖进军事冲突的威胁。
    这个条约把损害日本作为主权国家的权利和使日本丧失独立的新军事义务加在日本身上。
    如果要谈日本人民的权利的话，那么，同美国签订条约的日本政府没有考虑到大多数人民的意志。有数以百万计的日本人参加的、反对签订这个条约的声势浩大的行动就证明了这一点。
    哈里科夫说，赫脱唆使日本统治集团，同他们一起重弹苏联备忘录是“干涉日本内政”的滥调。难道民族利益受到日美军事条约危害的苏联发表自己的意见，就是干涉吗？苏联对于采取阻碍苏日关系发展、破坏远东和平基础的日美军事同盟这样的步骤，自然不能漠然视之。如果谈到干涉的话，那么这首先就是美国的压力和干涉。
    哈里科夫指出，赫脱硬说苏联威胁日本的论调也是毫无根据的。日本由于把自己的领土作为外国的军事基地，它所遇到的局势是严重的。苏联作为日本的近邻，不能不注意到这一点。
    哈里科夫写道：赫脱企图歪曲苏联对齿舞群岛和色丹岛的立场。他甚至说这种立场是令人痛心的。但是，在备忘录中非常清楚地说明，苏联不能助长这种情况：由于把上述岛屿移交给日本而更加扩大外国军队所利用的领土。
    赫脱先生的痛心尤其令人奇怪的是，大家知道，美国至今还没有把自古以来就属于日本的冲绳岛归还日本，而把它作为自己的军事基地。谁能保险齿舞群岛和色丹岛不遭到同样的命运，也就是说，不被美国军队所占领呢？
    哈里科夫最后说，赫脱企图在苏联对待日本的态度和苏联政府对缓和国际紧张局势的愿望之间找到某种矛盾。这实在是企图嫁罪于人。大家都知道，缔结日美军事条约根本不能当作缓和国际紧张局势的行动。
