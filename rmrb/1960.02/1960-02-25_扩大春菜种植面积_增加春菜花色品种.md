Expand the Planting Area of Spring Vegetables and Increase the Variety of Spring Vegetable Colors
Shandong, Henan, and Hunan Provinces Grasp Both Base Production and Mass Production, Both Major Vegetables and Special Varieties

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 23rd -- Commune members in Shandong are seizing the favorable opportunity of warm spring weather to actively prepare for spring vegetable sowing and strengthen winter vegetable management. Some areas have already begun sowing spring vegetables.

In order to strive for a bumper harvest of spring vegetables, all regions are focusing on land preparation, fertilizer accumulation, seed preparation, ridging, and embankment construction. The vegetable professional teams of the 25 vegetable production bases in the suburbs of Dezhou City, such as Beichang and Shaomaying, have accumulated more than 6.8 million catties of various fertilizers for vegetable fields in a short period. In order to plant enough spring vegetables on time, Qingdao has cultivated a lot of vegetable seedlings such as kohlrabi, eggplant, tomato, and sweet pepper, preparing for timely transplanting. Heze, Jining, Changwei, Jinan and other five special districts (cities), on the basis of implementing the vegetable planting plan at all levels, have prominently grasped seed preparation, and have now prepared more than 1.25 million catties of various vegetable seeds.

In the process of preparing vegetables, all regions are also focusing on scattered land and adopting intercropping and multiple cropping methods to expand the vegetable planting area. Yao Gao Brigade of Qiji Commune in Shou Zhang County rushed to reclaim 356 mu of idle land at the entrance of the village in three days, preparing to plant vegetables. Many communes with little land and a large population in the Changwei and Jinan areas are promoting the method of intercropping and multiple cropping to plant spring vegetables, striving to achieve self-sufficiency through supply from other places. Licheng County has now intercropped more than 10,000 mu of early-maturing spring vegetables in wheat fields and sweet potato ditches.

Jiaozhou Chinese cabbage, Zhangqiu scallions, and Laiwu ginger are famous vegetables in Shandong. The provincial leadership has determined to establish 13 bases for the production of these vegetables. Now, these famous vegetable base counties are expanding the planting area and building experimental fields, command fields, or high-yield fields to strive for multiple harvests. Zhangqiu scallions, which are famous at home and abroad, will have more than double the planting area this year compared to last year. For other vegetables such as ginger in Laiwu County, the planting area is planned to be more than double that of last year; garlic in Jiaxiang and Tancheng has good quality and wide sales, and will also be expanded significantly this year.

At the same time, all regions have also paid attention to strengthening field management of overwintering vegetables. In order to achieve early maturity and high yield of winter vegetables, the members and cadres of Niujiaodian Commune in Chiping County went out together and watered 1,500 mu of vegetable fields in a few days. Qiji Commune in Shou Zhang County implemented a three-way combination of cadres, technicians, and commune members, divided areas and contracted them, and adopted professional management methods. The 3,700 mu of overwintering vegetables in the entire commune have been top-dressed and watered twice.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 23rd -- People's communes in Henan are extensively planting spring vegetables and managing overwintering vegetables. At present, nearly one million mu of various spring vegetables have been sown in the province. People's communes in the suburbs of various cities have expanded the planting area of spring vegetables this year to meet the needs of the cities. Eight cities including Luoyang and Zhengzhou have sown more than 300,000 mu of spring vegetables such as bamboo shoots, Chinese cabbage, spinach, and radishes this year, an increase of 63.2% over last year. In order to meet the needs of the city, the Second Agricultural Vegetable Production Brigade of Beijiao Commune in Luoyang City recently purchased more than 60 kinds of new vegetable seeds from Shanghai, Hangzhou, Jinan and other places, expanding the variety of spring vegetables.

People's communes in various regions have made comprehensive arrangements for the production of spring and summer vegetables according to the policy of giving equal importance to self-sufficient production and commodity production. Generally, they have paid attention to grasping both base production and mass large-scale production; grasping both commodity vegetables and self-sufficient vegetables; and grasping both farmland vegetable cultivation and idle wasteland vegetable cultivation. Wen County fixed more than 8,000 laborers, formed more than 700 professional vegetable planting groups, and concentrated on managing more than 10,000 mu of vegetable bases. At the same time, they mobilized the masses to use all open spaces and waste land to grow vegetables in large quantities, and rushed to reclaim and plant vegetables on more than 3,500 mu in just two days.

While sowing spring vegetables, all regions have seized the field management of overwintering vegetables. At present, winter vegetables in many communes have been watered once or twice with returning green water and top-dressed once or twice with returning green fertilizer.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 23rd -- Hunan Province is vigorously sowing spring vegetables, striving for more varieties, high yields, and more harvests. Xiangtan Special District had already sown 452,000 mu of spring vegetables as early as January. In places where spring vegetables were planted early, the gardens are now full of spring colors.

Hunan Province regards the rational arrangement of land as an important measure to do a good job in this year's spring vegetable production. Under the guidance of the policy of "taking grain as the key link and making an all-round leap forward," in order to prevent spring vegetables from occupying the area of grain and cash crops, all regions have expanded the planting of spring vegetables through wasteland reclamation and the use of vacant land. Xianzijiao Commune in Ling County mobilized commune members to combine with land preparation and checking of mountains and land to find 8,700 mu of small gaps in mountains, river continents, and front and back of houses suitable for planting pumpkins. Xitang Commune in Yueyang County organized 290 cadres and old farmers to survey all 98,000 mu of barren mountains in the commune and found that 12,000 mu of barren mountains with good soil quality and sunshine were suitable for planting melons and vegetables, so they organized labor to reclaim them and plant melons and vegetables. They also used more than 2,000 field ridges. In this way, the land for the 13,000 mu of spring vegetables expanded this year was solved.

Due to the expansion of the planting area and the increase in the demand for spring vegetable seeds, all regions have adopted the method of self-reliance as the mainstay and external assistance as a supplement to solve the seed problem. (Attached picture)

    贯彻自给性生产和商品性生产并举方针让城乡人民吃到更多更好的蔬菜
    扩大春菜种植面积  增加春菜花色品种
    山东河南湖南既抓基地生产，又抓群众性生产，既抓大宗蔬菜，又抓特产品种
    新华社济南23日电　山东各地人民公社社员正抓住春暖花开有利时机，积极准备春菜播种和加强冬菜管理工作，有些地区已经开始播种春菜。
    为了力争春菜丰产，各地都大抓整地、积肥、备种、打垅、筑畦等工作。德州市郊北厂、哨马营等二十五个蔬菜生产基地的蔬菜专业队，短期内已为菜地积造各种肥料六百八十多万斤。青岛市为适时种足种好春菜，已经培育出很多大头菜、茄子、西红柿、大椒等菜苗，准备及时移栽。菏泽、济宁、昌潍、济南等五个专区（市）在蔬菜种植计划层层落实的基础上，突出地抓住了种子准备，现在已经准备的各种菜种达一百二十五万多斤。
    各地在准备种菜中，还大抓零星地和采取间作套作等办法，力争扩大蔬菜播种面积。寿张县七级公社姚皋大队三天突击开出村头闲散土地三百五十六亩，准备种菜。昌潍、济南地区许多地少人多的公社，推广间作套作的办法种春菜。力争由外地供应达到自给。现在历城县已在麦田和甘薯沟里间种早熟春菜一万多亩。
    胶州大白菜、章丘大葱、莱芜生姜等是山东蔬菜中的名品。对这些蔬菜的生产，省领导部门已确定分别建立十三处基地。现在，这些名菜基地县正在扩大播种面积，大建试验田、指挥田或丰产方，争取多种丰收。闻名国内的章丘大葱，今年的种植面积将比去年增加一倍以上。其他如莱芜县的生姜，种植面积准备比去年扩大二倍多；嘉祥、郯城的大蒜，质量好销路广，今年也将大量扩种。
    与此同时，各地还注意了加强越冬蔬菜的田间管理。茌平县牛角店公社为了作到冬菜早熟高产，社员和干部一齐出动，不几天就将一千五百亩菜田浇了一遍水。寿张县七级公社实行干部、技术人员和社员三结合，分片包干，专业管理的方法，全社三千七百亩越冬蔬菜，已普遍追了一次肥，浇了两次水。
    新华社郑州23日电　河南各地人民公社大种春菜和管理越冬蔬菜。目前全省已播种各种春菜近一百万亩。各城市郊区的人民公社，为了供应城市需要，今年都扩大了春菜播种面积。洛阳、郑州等八个市，今年播种笋菜、小白菜、菠菜、水萝卜等春菜三十多万亩，比去年扩大63．2％。洛阳市北郊公社二农蔬菜生产大队，为了满足城市需要，最近从上海、杭州、济南等地购买六十多种新菜种，扩大了春菜的花色品种。
    各地人民公社都根据自给性生产和商品性生产并举的方针，对春、夏菜生产作了全面安排。一般都注意了既抓基地生产，又抓群众性的大面积生产；既抓商品菜，又抓自食菜；既抓耕地种菜，又抓闲散荒地种菜。温县固定劳力八千多人，组成七百多个专业种菜组，集中管理一万多亩蔬菜基地，同时发动群众利用一切空地、废地大量种菜。仅两天时间即突击开荒种菜三千五百多亩。
    在播种春菜的同时，各地都抓紧了越冬蔬菜的田间管理工作。目前，许多公社的冬菜都浇过一次到两次返青水和上过一、二次返青肥。
    据新华社长沙23日电　湖南省大力播种春季蔬菜，争取多种、高产、多收。湘潭专区早在1月份就已播种春菜四十五万二千亩。春菜种得早的地方，现在已是满园春色了。
  湖南省各地把合理安排土地作为搞好今年春菜生产的一项重要措施。各地在“以粮为纲，全面跃进”的方针指导下，为了使春菜不占用粮食和经济作物的面积，都通过开荒、利用空闲隙地等办法扩种春菜。酃县仙子脚公社发动社员结合备耕查山、查地，找出适宜种南瓜的山、河洲、屋前屋后的小块空隙地八千七百亩。岳阳县西塘公社组织二百九十个干部和老农把全社九万八千亩荒山全部勘察了一遍，发现有一万二千亩土质、阳光好的荒山适宜种瓜菜，便组织劳力开垦，种上了瓜菜；他们又把二千多条田塍利用起来。这样，今年扩种的一万三千亩春菜的土地便解决了。
    由于播种面积扩大，春菜种子需用量增加，各地采取自力更生为主，外援为辅的办法解决了种子问题。（附图片）
