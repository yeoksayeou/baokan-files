Reviving Waste Light Bulbs
Ministry of Commerce Decides to Promote Beijing's Experience

(Our dispatch) Beijing's street factory - Tianqiao Red Flag Instrument Factory, with the help of the Beijing Transportation Electrical Equipment Supply Station, has successfully experimented with replacing filaments in burned-out incandescent light bulbs.

The method for replicating waste light bulbs is simple and easy to implement: heat the top of the bulb, pierce a small round hole with a steel needle, then use a special tool to remove the broken tungsten filament from the small hole, replace it with a new tungsten filament, finally connect a glass tube at the pierced hole, evacuate the air from the bulb, seal the round hole, and then replicate it after a high-voltage test. It usually takes four or five days for the average person to learn. Tests have proven that the lifespan of the replicated light bulbs is basically the same as that of new light bulbs. The brightness is only slightly lower than new light bulbs.

The main equipment needed for replication is: one vacuum pump, one set of distribution panels, and one high-frequency leak detector, requiring only 1,300 yuan. The main raw materials needed are a portion of tungsten filament and a small amount of tin, red phosphorus, and glass tubes, which are also relatively easy to obtain.

At the recent national on-site conference, the Ministry of Commerce decided to vigorously promote this experience throughout the country.

    复活废灯泡
    商业部决定推广北京的经验
    本报讯　北京街道工厂——天桥红旗仪器厂，在北京交通电工器材供应站帮助下，试验断丝电灯泡换丝复制获得成功。
    复制废灯泡的办法简单易行：把灯泡顶端烧热，用钢针刺个小圆孔，然后用特制的工具从小孔中把断钨丝拿出来，换上新钨丝，最后在刺孔处接上玻璃管，将泡内空气抽净，圆孔封死，再经过高压试验，就复制成了。一般人四五天就可以学会。经试验证明，复制的灯泡照明的寿命和新灯泡基本相同。亮度仅略次于新灯泡。
    复制所需的主要设备是：真空泵一台，配电盘一套，高频探漏器一只，只需要一千三百元。需要的原料主要是一部分钨丝和少量的锡、赤磷和玻璃管，也比较容易解决。
    商业部在最近召开的全国现场会议上，决定在全国各地大力推广这一经验。
