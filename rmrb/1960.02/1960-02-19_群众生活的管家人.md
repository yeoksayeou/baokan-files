    The vivid facts of some commercial departments in large cities such as Shanghai, Chongqing, and Tianjin organizing the economic lives of the people in every possible way embody our great Party's infinite concern and meticulous care for the people; embody the nature and role of socialist commerce in serving production and consumption; and reflect the new type of relationship between people under the socialist system. The noble style of commercial workers, who wholeheartedly serve the people, makes us feel so happy and warm to live in the big family of our socialist motherland.
    According to past conventions, it would have been good enough for these commercial departments to understand the requirements and opinions of each unit, grasp the living conditions of various customers, be familiar with consumers' consumption levels, living habits, tastes, and preferences, so as to reasonably allocate goods, meet the needs of the masses, facilitate the masses, and deliver goods to their doors. However, they are not satisfied with this, and further jump out of the circle of buying and selling to help the masses establish canteen management systems and arrange recipes, improve cooking skills, and hold cooking training classes. This is not enough, they further help the masses organize various social service undertakings, repair stoves, repair electrical appliances and ironware, fluff old cotton, sew and wash clothes, mend rubber shoes, and even think of and do things such as asking for doctors, caring for patients, decocting medicine, midwifery, finding nannies, and handling weddings and funerals. How thoughtful! How meticulous! How inspiring!
    What force is driving our commercial workers to do this? Please listen to their heartfelt words:
    Rather trouble ourselves a thousand times than let the masses feel inconvenienced even once;
    As long as production increases steadily, we are willing to break our backs for the workers.
    Caring for others and wholeheartedly serving the people is the spirit of our times. It illuminates the ideological realm of every revolutionary, shining with dazzling golden light. This noble thought greatly changes people's mental outlook, makes people understand how they should live, how they should work, how they should treat others; makes people understand what should be their joy, what should be their worries; makes people understand what they should love, what they should care about.
    Our commercial workers, under the control of this thought, regard what seems to be extra work as their own work, and do it wholeheartedly, trying every means to do it well. They regard seemingly "nagging" and "trivial" life trivia as political work and as important things to do. They consciously act as stewards of the people's lives. We also need more stewards with such communist style to manage our big and small families well, to inspire the enthusiasm and strength of millions of people from daily life, and to deepen the close ties between the Party and the masses.
    Long live the stewards!

    群众生活的管家人
    成里
    上海、重庆、天津等大城市的一些商业部门千方百计地组织人民群众经济生活的生动事实，体现了我们伟大的党对人民群众的无限关怀和无微不至的爱护；体现了社会主义商业服务于生产和消费的性质与作用；反映了在社会主义制度下人与人之间的新型的关系。商业工作同志们，那种全心全意为人民服务的崇高风格，使我们感到生活在社会主义祖国的大家庭中，是多么幸福和温暖。
    按过去的常规说，这些商业部门了解每一个单位的要求和意见，掌握各种顾客的生活情况，熟悉消费者的消费水平、生活习惯、口味喜好等等，作到合理分配商品，满足群众需要，方便群众，送货上门，这已经够好的了。但是，他们并不满足于此，还进一步跳出买和卖的圈子，帮助群众建立食堂管理制度和安排菜谱、提高烹饪技术、举办烹饪训练班。这还不够，他们更进一步帮助群众组织各种社会服务事业，修理炉灶，修理电器、铁器，弹旧棉花，缝洗衣服，补胶鞋，直到代请医生、侍候病人、煎汤熬药、接生护理、找保姆、办理婚丧等等事情，都想到和办到了。多么周到！多么细致！多么激动人心！
    是什么力量，支配着我们的商业工作同志们这样做的？请听他们的心声：
    宁愿自己麻烦千遍，不让群众稍感不便；
    只要生产步步高，愿为工人折断腰。
    关心别人，全心全意为人民服务，本是我们时代的精神。它照亮了每个革命者的思想领域，闪烁着耀眼的金光。这种崇高的思想，使人的精神面貌大改变，使人们懂得应该怎么生活，怎么工作，怎么对待别人；使人们懂得什么应是自己的乐趣，什么应是自己的忧虑；使人们懂得自己应该爱什么，应该关心什么。
    我们的商业工作同志们，就是在这种思想支配下，把看来似乎是分外的事，当作分内的事去做，而且全心全意地去做，千方百计地去做好。他们把看来是“婆婆妈妈”、“鸡毛蒜皮”的生活琐事，当作政治工作去做，当作大事去做。他们自觉地去当群众生活的管家人。我们也正需要更多的这样具有共产主义风格的管家人，来管好我们的大小的家庭，从日常生活里鼓舞千百万人的干劲和力量，加深党和群众的密切联系。
    管家人万岁！
