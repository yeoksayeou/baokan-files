Xinhua News Agency, February 15th, Taipei News: American aggressors continue to carry out military provocation activities in the Taiwan Straits area. According to Taiwan newspapers, the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique's navy held a provocative joint exercise in the Taiwan Straits for three consecutive days starting on the 12th. This "anti-submarine and mine-sweeping military exercise" was held in the southern waters of Taiwan. A total of 15 U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek vessels participated.

Taiwan newspapers said that the United States recently transferred another warship to the Chiang Kai-shek clique for use. This warship, named "Tuo Jiang" by the Chiang gang, had already sailed from the United States to Taiwan on January 25 to join the Chiang Kai-shek navy's combat ranks. At the same time, on February 2, the United States also decided to extend the loan period of the destroyer "Rodman," which it had lent to the Chiang Kai-shek navy, for another five years. This warship was lent to the Chiang Kai-shek clique by the United States in 1954, and the loan period was originally scheduled to expire in July of this year. The United States now has a total of four destroyers and five escort destroyers lent to the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and these warships are under the command of the U.S. military assistance advisory group stationed in Taiwan, engaging in provocative harassment activities in the Taiwan Strait.

Taiwan newspapers said that responsible officials of the U.S. invading Taiwan air force units and the Chiang Kai-shek air force units held a joint meeting on February 9. The meeting was co-chaired by Dean, commander of the U.S. Thirteenth Air Force's forward command post in Taiwan and head of the U.S. military assistance advisory group's air force group in Taiwan, and Chen Chia-shang, commander of the Chiang gang's air force. The news said that the meeting was held to "discuss this year's action plan." Dean, the head of the U.S. invading Taiwan air force, admitted at the meeting that the U.S. Air Force's "advisory work" had penetrated into the "lower-level units" of the Chiang Kai-shek Air Force. He said that in the future, U.S. military advisors should not only continue to control the "combat departments" of the Chiang Kai-shek Air Force, but also "provide more assistance" to the "control and management departments" of the Chiang Kai-shek Air Force, which means strengthening control. This meeting took place after U.S. Pacific Air Force Commander O'Donnell and U.S. Thirteenth Air Force Commander Moomaw arrived in Taiwan to plot war conspiracies.

    在台湾地区不断兴风作浪
    美国加紧军事挑衅活动
    侵台美军加强对蒋介石空军的控制
    新华社15日讯　台北消息：美国侵略者在台湾海峡地区继续进行军事挑衅活动。据台湾报纸报道，美国和蒋介石集团海军12日起在台湾海峡举行了一连三天的挑衅性联合演习。这次“反潜艇和扫雷军事演习”在台湾南部海面举行。共有美、蒋舰艇十五艘参加。
    台湾报纸说，美国最近又把一艘军舰移交给蒋介石集团使用。这艘由蒋帮命名为“沱江号”的军舰已经在1月25日由美国驶抵台湾，参加蒋介石海军的战斗序列。同时，美国在2月2日还决定把它借给蒋介石海军使用的驱逐舰“罗德曼号”的借用期限延长五年。这艘军舰是美国在1954年借给蒋介石集团的，原定今年7月借用期满。美国现在共有四艘驱逐舰和五艘护航驱逐舰借给蒋介石集团，这些军舰都在美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团的指挥下，在台湾海峡从事挑衅骚扰活动。
    台湾报纸说，美国侵台空军部队和蒋介石空军部队的负责官员2月9日举行了联席会议。这次会议由美国第十三航空队驻台湾前进指挥部司令兼美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团空军组组长迪安和蒋帮空军司令陈嘉尚共同主持。消息说，这次会议是为了“讨论本年度的行动计划”。侵台美国空军头子迪安在会上承认，美国空军的“顾问工作”已经深入到蒋介石空军的“低级单位”。他说，今后美国军事顾问不但要继续控制蒋介石空军的“作战部门”，而且对蒋介石空军的“管制和经理部门也要多加协助”，也就是加强控制。这次会议是在美国太平洋空军司令奥当纳耳和美国第十三航空队司令穆尔曼到台湾策划战争阴谋活动后进行的。
