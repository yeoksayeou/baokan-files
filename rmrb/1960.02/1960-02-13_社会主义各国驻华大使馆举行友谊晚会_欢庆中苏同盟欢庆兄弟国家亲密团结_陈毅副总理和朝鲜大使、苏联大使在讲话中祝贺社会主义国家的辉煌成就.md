Xinhua News Agency, February 12th—The embassies of socialist countries in China held a friendship reception tonight to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the signing the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance.

Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi attended the friendship reception. In his speech at the reception banquet, he pointed out that this reception fully demonstrates that all socialist countries regard the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, a day of historical significance, as their own and our common festival, vividly displaying the close unity and great friendship between our fraternal countries.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said: As mankind turns the first page of the history of the 1960s, we are pleased to see that the great Soviet people have made brilliant achievements in realizing the magnificent plan of transition to communism, and the fraternal countries in Eastern Europe and Asia are greatly accelerating the pace of socialist construction. Relying on the general line of socialist construction, the development speed of the Great Leap Forward, and the organizational form of the people's communes, the Chinese people have created a sustained leap forward situation of balanced and high-speed development in our country's socialist construction. The victory of the Chinese people's socialist cause is inseparable from the sincere assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries. Please allow me to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt gratitude on behalf of our party, government and people to you, and through you to the parties, governments and people of your countries.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said: The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has consistently safeguarded peace and made unremitting and great efforts to ease international tensions. The recent high-level meeting of the Warsaw Treaty member states held in Moscow and the declaration issued by the meeting once again put forward a series of positive and reasonable proposals on major international issues such as general disarmament and the German peace treaty. These proposals are a new contribution made by the united socialist countries to the cause of world peace, and they have been warmly welcomed by peace-loving people and countries all over the world. Now the problem is very clear: whether the current international situation can be further eased and whether the major and mature international issues can be resolved depend on whether the Western bloc headed by the United States has the sincerity for peace. If they stubbornly adhere to their original position in the face of the sincere efforts repeatedly made by the socialist countries, then they will fall into greater isolation throughout the world.

Vice Premier Chen Yi proposed a toast to the eternal and unbreakable friendship and the long-tested and increasingly strong alliance between the Chinese and Soviet people, to the further enhancement of the close unity between the people of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, to the communist parties of the socialist countries that lead us from victory to victory, to the great people of all socialist countries, to the common prosperity of all socialist countries, and to world peace.

Tonight, the ambassadors, charge d'affaires ad interim and diplomatic officials of eleven fraternal countries in China, including the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Mongolian People's Republic, the German Democratic Republic, Albania, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as well as members of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association delegation, attended the friendship reception.

At the beginning of the banquet, Korean Ambassador to China, Li Yong-ho, spoke on behalf of the embassies of the fraternal countries in China. He said that the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is not only of great significance for guaranteeing world peace and strengthening the unity and solidarity of the socialist camp, but is also a fatal blow to imperialism. He said that in recent years, under the trend of the East wind prevailing over the West wind, the friendship, unity and power of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union have been strengthened and developed, becoming invincible, and it has become a decisive guarantee to prevent imperialism from launching a new war. Today, the surging trend of the times, which is unfavorable to the imperialist camp and favorable to the socialist camp, cannot be changed.

Soviet Ambassador to China, Chervonenko, also spoke. He said that there is a fraternal and unbreakable friendship between all countries in the socialist camp, which is based on the lofty principles of proletarian internationalism and illuminated by the eternal light of Marxism-Leninism. The victories won by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries have created the real prerequisite for a wider development of a new type of international relations, that is, the cooperation and fraternal mutual assistance between our socialist countries. He emphasized that the friendship between the Soviet Union and China and the friendship between the countries of the socialist camp are eternal and unbreakable. No force in the world can destroy this friendship.

Tonight, Vice Foreign Ministers Zhang Hanfu, Ji Pengfei, Zeng Yongquan, and heads of the friendship associations between China and the eleven fraternal countries attended the friendship reception. The reception proceeded from beginning to end in an atmosphere of close unity and intimate friendship of the socialist family. Before the banquet, everyone happily participated in various recreational activities. After the banquet, some enjoyed films from socialist countries, and some danced. Finally, artists from China, the Soviet Union, and Poland performed wonderful artistic programs. The reception lasted until late at night.

    欢庆中苏同盟欢庆兄弟国家亲密团结
    陈毅副总理和朝鲜大使、苏联大使在讲话中祝贺社会主义国家的辉煌成就
    新华社12日讯　社会主义各国驻中国大使馆今晚举行友谊晚会，欢庆中苏友好同盟互助条约签订十周年。
    陈毅副总理兼外交部长出席了友谊晚会。他在友谊晚会的聚餐会上讲话中指出，这个晚会，充分地表现了各社会主义国家把签订中苏友好同盟互助条约这一具有历史意义的日子看成是自己的和我们共同的节日，生动地显示了我们兄弟国家之间的亲密团结和伟大友谊。
    陈毅副总理说：当人类掀开了二十世纪六十年代历史初页的今天，我们高兴地看到，伟大的苏联人民在实现向共产主义过渡的宏伟计划中取得了辉煌的成就，东欧和亚洲各兄弟国家都在大大加快社会主义建设的步伐。中国人民依靠着社会主义建设的总路线、大跃进的发展速度和人民公社的组织形式，开创了我国社会主义建设又按比例又高速度发展的持续跃进局面。中国人民的社会主义事业的胜利是同苏联和其他兄弟国家的真诚援助分不开的。请允许我借此机会代表我们的党、政府和人民向你们，并通过你们向你们国家的党、政府和人民表示衷心的感谢。
    陈毅副总理说：以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国，一贯维护和平并且为和缓国际紧张局势作出了坚持不懈的巨大努力。不久前在莫斯科召开的华沙条约缔约国高级会议和这个会议发表的宣言，又一次对普遍裁军、对德和约等重大国际问题，提出了一系列的积极的合理的建议，这些建议是团结一致的社会主义国家对世界和平事业所作出的新的贡献，它受到了全世界爱好和平的人民和国家的热烈欢迎。现在问题很清楚，当前国际形势能否进一步和缓，国际间重大的和已经成熟了的问题能否得到解决，关键在于以美国为首的西方集团是否具有和平的诚意。如果他们在社会主义国家一再做出的真诚努力面前，仍然顽固地坚持原来的立场，那么，他们就会在全世界陷于更大的孤立。
    陈毅副总理提议，为中苏两国人民之间永恒的、牢不可破的友谊和久经考验的、日益强大的同盟，为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民之间亲密团结的进一步增强，为引导我们从胜利走向胜利的社会主义各国的共产党，为各社会主义国家的伟大人民，为各社会主义国家的共同繁荣，为世界的和平，干杯。
    今晚，苏联、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、蒙古人民共和国、德意志民主共和国、阿尔巴尼亚、越南民主共和国等十一个兄弟国家驻中国的大使、临时代办和外交官员，苏中友好协会代表团的成员等，都出席了友谊晚会。
    在聚餐会开始的时候，朝鲜驻中国大使李永镐代表各兄弟国家驻中国大使馆讲话。他说，苏中友好同盟互助条约的签订，不仅对于保障世界巩固的和平、加强社会主义阵营各国的统一和团结，具有重大的意义，而且对于帝国主义也是致命的打击。他说，近年来，在东风压倒西风的时代潮流下，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家的友谊、团结和威力，已经加强和发展起来了，变得不可战胜，它已经成为制止帝国主义发动新战争的决定性保证。今天，对帝国主义阵营不利、对社会主义阵营有利的汹涌澎湃的时代潮流，是无法改变的。
    苏联驻中国大使契尔沃年科也讲了话。他说，整个社会主义阵营各国之间存在着兄弟般的牢不可破的友谊，这种友谊是以崇高的无产阶级国际主义原则为基础的，并且是以永不熄灭的马克思列宁主义的光辉照耀着的。苏联和其他社会主义国家所获得的胜利，创造了现实的前提来更加广泛地发展新型的国际关系，就是我们社会主义各国之间的合作与兄弟般的互助。他强调指出，苏中两国之间的友谊，社会主义阵营各国之间的友谊，是永恒而牢不可破的。世界上没有任何力量能够破坏这种友谊。
    今晚，外交部副部长章汉夫、姬鹏飞、曾涌泉和中国同十一个兄弟国家的友好协会的负责人，都出席了友谊晚会。晚会自始至终都在社会主义大家庭紧密团结和亲密友谊的气氛中进行。在聚餐会以前，大家愉快地进行着各种游艺活动，聚餐会以后，有的欣赏社会主义各国的影片，有的跳交谊舞。最后，中国、苏联和波兰的艺术家们表演了精彩的文艺节目。晚会一直进行到深夜。
