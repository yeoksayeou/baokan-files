Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th Dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party's organ "Red Flag" published an editorial today, strongly condemning Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi for including the Chinese territories of Jinmen and Mazu Islands within the scope of application of the new Japan-US "Security Treaty" when answering questions about the "Far East range." It also pointed out that this is proof that the Kishi Nobusuke government wants to act as an accomplice to the United States in its aggression against China.

The editorial pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke himself, in a series of recent speeches in the Diet, proved that the new "Security Treaty" is indeed an aggressive Japan-US military alliance aimed at China and the Soviet Union.

The editorial pointed out that since the Soviet government presented a memorandum to Japan on January 27 regarding the new "Security Treaty," Kishi Nobusuke has adopted a new trick of sophistry, changing his tune and no longer mentioning the blatant words of former Foreign Minister Fujiyama that the scope of the Far East includes the coastal areas of China and the Maritime Territory of the Soviet Union. However, on the other hand, he used the Kuril Islands issue to incite anti-Soviet sentiment in an attempt to divert public opinion from their conspiracy.

The editorial pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet has consistently concealed the true content agreed upon between Japan and the United States before and after signing the new "Security Treaty," plotting to deceive the Diet and the Japanese public. The editorial further pointed out that the attitude of Kishi Nobusuke and others is not only a mockery of the Japanese Diet and the people, but also a provocation against China and the Soviet Union.

The editorial emphasized that the Japanese people will absolutely not allow Kishi Nobusuke to use despicable means to force the Diet to pass the new "Security Treaty," and they must thoroughly investigate the major political responsibility of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and ignite the flames of overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet throughout Japan.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th Dispatch: Secretary-General of the Japan Socialist Party Inejiro Asanuma told a United Press International reporter on the 11th that the fundamental issue of maintaining peace in the Far East is first and foremost the withdrawal of American troops from their bases in Okinawa, other parts of Japan, Taiwan of China, South Korea and the Philippines.

The leader of the Japan Socialist Party said that the United States, the Soviet Union, China, and Japan should establish a collective security system to maintain peace in the Far East.

Referring to Japan-China relations, Asanuma pointed out that Japan must sever relations with Taiwan because Taiwan is part of China. He said that there cannot be such a thing as "two Chinas."

    日共“赤旗报”发表社论指出
    岸信介要当美国侵华帮凶
    日本人民将在全国燃起打倒岸内阁的怒火
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，强烈谴责日本首相岸信介就“远东范围”问题答辩时竟把中国领土金门、马祖岛列入新日美“安全条约”的适用范围，并且指出这是岸信介政府要充当美国的侵华帮凶的证明。
    社论指出，岸信介自己最近在国会一连串的发言中，证明了新“安全条约”确实是针对中苏两国的侵略性的日美军事同盟。
    社论指出，自从苏联政府在1月27日就新“安全条约”问题向日本提出备忘录以后，岸信介采取了新的诡辩手法，改为不提过去藤山外相所说远东的范围包括中国沿海地区和苏联滨海区的露骨字眼。但是另一方面，却用千岛问题煽动反苏情绪，企图转移舆论对它们的阴谋的注意力。
    社论指出，岸信介内阁在签署新“安全条约”前后，始终隐瞒日美两国间所商定的真实内容，阴谋欺骗国会和日本公众。社论进一步指出，岸信介等这种态度不仅是对日本国会和人民的愚弄，也是对中苏两国的挑衅。
    社论强调指出，日本人民绝对不容许岸信介玩弄卑鄙的手段迫使国会通过新“安全条约”，一定要彻底追究岸信介内阁的重大的政治责任，并且要在日本全国燃起打倒岸信介内阁的烽火。
    据新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎在11日对合众国际社记者说，维护远东和平的基本问题首先是美国从它在冲绳岛和日本的其它部分、中国的台湾、南朝鲜和菲律宾的基地撤退它的军队。
    这位日本社会党的领袖说，美国、苏联、中国和日本应该建立一个集体安全体系，来保持远东的和平。
    浅沼在谈到日中关系时指出，日本必须断绝同台湾的关系，因为台湾是中国的一部分。他说，不能有“两个中国”这样的东西。
