    The Source of Creation
    Wu Lü
    Cultivating fields in a garden-like manner is still a new problem in agricultural production; using machines to achieve garden-like cultivation is an even newer problem. Wasn't there such a discussion before? -- Machines can do rough work, but cannot replace careful and meticulous farming.

    Now, such machines have appeared in Qizhou People's Commune, Anguo County, Hebei Province. Rolling, harrowing, leveling, tilling, and ridging, five processes all at once. The work done by two draft animals and one laborer in a day is equivalent to the work previously done by more than 130 laborers and five draft animals in a day. The quality is so good that even the most experienced old farmers can't find any fault with it. This land-leveling and ridging machine was not invented by a famous agricultural machinery expert, but by several workers in a small farm tool repair shop in Qizhou People's Commune. They adopted the method of "first being a student, then being a teacher," researched more than 20 improved farm tools used by farmers for garden-like cultivation, and created it after many experiments.

    A small commune factory, without technical experts or new equipment, has produced such a brand-new creation. Isn't it a bit unexpected? In fact, it is not unexpected at all. The farm tool repair shop of Qizhou People's Commune, despite having unfavorable conditions in terms of technology and equipment, has the most favorable condition for technological creation: that is, their factory is the factory of the People's Commune, their workers are originally farmers, they have close ties with agricultural production practice, and based on the materialistic dialectical law that "knowledge comes from practice and serves practice," they consciously devote themselves to agricultural production practice by adopting the method of "first being a student, then being a teacher." This gives them access to an inexhaustible source of creation and cultivates many new agricultural machines and improved farm tools. The land-leveling and ridging machine is just one of them.

    All scientific and technological innovations come from production practice. Historical facts prove that it is always the needs of production practice that put forward propositions for scientific and technological work, promote the development of scientific and technological work, and it is always the experience of production practice that accumulates rich nourishment for the development of scientific and technological work. Why have the "humble" always been the most intelligent since ancient times? Because it is these people living in the "lower layers" who have the closest contact with production practice. Without production practice, there would be no innovation, and therefore no development of science and technology. The birth of the land-leveling and ridging machine once again makes us recognize this truth. It is the practice of agricultural production that put forward the task of using machines to realize garden-like cultivation; it is the improved tools used by farmers to realize garden-like cultivation that provided the initial ideas for solving this task; and then the workers of the Qizhou People's Commune farm tool repair shop felt this need, summarized the farmers' experience, and created the land-leveling and ridging machine. And the perfection and improvement of the land-leveling and ridging machine also depends on its application to agricultural production practice.

    In 1894, Engels said in a letter to Starkenburg: "Once a technical need arises in society, this need will push science forward more than a dozen universities." Our era is an era of great development of social productive forces. The production practice of more than 600 million people is constantly putting forward a large number of "technical needs." Such an era is precisely an era of great development of science and technology. The first thing that all those who aspire to climb the peak of science and technology need to do is to participate in the vigorous production practice.

    创造的源泉
    吴滤
    耕作园田化，还是农业生产中的一个新问题；用机器实现耕作园田化，更是一个新问题。不是曾经有过这样的议论吗？——机器可以干粗活，不能代替精耕细作。
    现在，这样的机器已经在河北省安国县祁州人民公社出现了。轧、耙、平、整、筑畦，五道工序一齐过，两个畜力一个劳力一天干的活，相当于过去一百三十多个劳力和五个畜力一天干的活。质量，连最有经验的老农也挑不出毛病来。这台平地筑畦机，不是什么著名的农业机械专家发明的，而是祁州人民公社一个很小的农具修制厂里的几个工人，采用“先当学生，后当先生”的办法，研究了农民二十多项用于耕作园田化的改良农具，经过多次试验创造出来的。
    一个小小的公社工厂，一无技术专家，二无新式设备，竟出现了这样一个崭新的创造，是不是有点出乎意料呢？其实，一点也不出乎意料。祁州人民公社的这个农具修制厂，尽管在技术上、在设备上，有这样或那样的不利条件；但是却有一个技术创造的最有利的条件，这就是他们的工厂是人民公社的工厂，他们的工人本来也是农民，他们同农业生产实践有着密切的联系，并且根据“认识来自实践，又服务于实践”的唯物辩证规律，采用“先当学生，后当先生”的办法，自觉地投身到农业生产的实践中去，这就得到取用不竭的创造的源泉，培养出许多新的农业机械和改良农具的花朵。平地筑畦机不过是其中的一项。
    一切科学技术的革新创造，都来自生产实践。历史的事实证明，总是生产实践的需要，给科学技术工作提出了命题，推动了科学技术工作的发展，并且总是生产实践的经验，为科学技术工作的发展积累了丰富的养料。为什么自古以来都是“卑贱者”最聪明？因为正是这些生活在“下层”的人们同生产实践联系最密切。离开了生产实践，就不会有革新创造，也就没有科学技术的发展。平地筑畦机的诞生，再一次让我们认识了这个真理。是农业生产的实践，提出了需要用机器来实现耕作园田化的课题；是农民用于实现耕作园田化的改良工具，提供了解决这个课题的最初的设想；然后才是祁州人民公社农具修制厂的工人感受到这种需要，总结了农民的经验，创造出平地筑畦机；而平地筑畦机的完善和提高，也有赖于运用到农业生产实践中去。
    1894年，恩格斯在给施塔尔肯堡的信中说：“社会方面一旦发生了技术上的需要，则这种需要就会比十数个大学更加把科学推向前进。”我们的时代是社会生产力大发展的时代，六亿多人民的生产实践，无时无刻不在提出大量“技术上的需要”。这样的时代，正是科学技术大发展的时代。一切有志于攀登科学技术顶峰的人，需要做的第一桩事情，就是参加到轰轰烈烈的生产实践中去。
