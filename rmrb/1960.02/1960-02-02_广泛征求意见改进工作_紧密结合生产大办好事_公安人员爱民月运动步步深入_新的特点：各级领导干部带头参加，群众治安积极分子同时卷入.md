Xinhua News Agency, January 1st Dispatch: During the Spring Festival of 1960, public security organs across the country universally launched the Love-the-People Month movement, achieving great results, further strengthening the ties between public security personnel and the people, and a new atmosphere of police loving the people and the people loving the police has emerged everywhere, with the relationship between the police and the people as close as fish and water.

The nationwide launch of the Love-the-People movement by public security organs around the Spring Festival began in the Spring Festival of 1959. This is a new creation of our country's public security work taking the mass line, and it is also a method for our people's police to inherit and carry forward the fine tradition of the Chinese People's Liberation Army of maintaining close ties with the people. In addition to regularly paying attention to contacting the masses and accepting their supervision, through such a movement, public security personnel across the country extensively solicit opinions from the masses, concentrate on conducting self-criticism, improve their work style, and actively do good deeds for the people, which further enables public security organs to receive the supervision and support of the masses, fully demonstrating the essence of the people's police.

This year's Love-the-People Month movement during the Spring Festival was carried out more extensively, more deeply, with more vivid and effective content than last year. It was carried out not only in grassroots units and among the broad masses of police officers, but also in leading organs and among public security cadres, and even mass public security organizations actively participated in this movement. In many places, the Love-the-People Month activities have spread to every corner, and a large number of good people and good deeds have emerged. According to recent statistics from cities such as Guangzhou, Wuhan, Tianjin, Shenyang, Chongqing, Zhengzhou, Guiyang, Changchun, and Xining, and provinces such as Shandong and Fujian, public security personnel have done more than 2.8 million good deeds for the people during the Love-the-People Month movement.

During the Love-the-People Month movement, public security personnel in various places generally took the Eight Disciplines and Ten Points for Attention of public security personnel as the main content, combined with the actual situation of their work in the region, conducted heated discussions, praised good people and good deeds, and launched criticism and self-criticism to further improve their thinking and work style. Public security personnel in many places also held various meetings to report on their work to residents, or visited door-to-door, posted big-character posters, and extensively solicited opinions from the masses. Public security sub-bureaus and police stations in Shanghai generally reported their work to the masses in their jurisdictions and solicited their opinions. As of January 25th, public security personnel in Jinan City, Shandong Province, had held more than 450 large and small mass meetings and visited more than 17,000 homes, which enabled them to extensively contact the masses and listen to their opinions and demands. The masses in various places actively put forward opinions with the attitude of masters, especially warmly praising the fine work style of the public security personnel. Since the launch of the Love-the-People Month movement by public security personnel in Nanjing, they have received more than 20,000 letters of praise and more than 2,400 suggestions and criticisms from the masses. It is unheard of in the old society for the people to directly criticize public security cadres and people's police. While sincerely praising the public security personnel, the people of Guiyang City put forward 457 criticisms of shortcomings in the work of the police. Some residents criticized individual police officers by name for shortcomings in their work style at the discussion. Individual public security personnel who were criticized sincerely accepted the opinions of the masses, and some even visited the masses who made suggestions to conduct self-criticism. The Zhongyuan Road Police Station in Zhengzhou City originally implemented the system in a more mechanical way, emphasizing that no work was done during study time, and urgent matters were not accepted, which aroused criticism from the masses. Now, this police station has changed to a method of handling matters as soon as they arrive and handling household registration matters door-to-door, which has been well received by the masses.

During the Love-the-People Month movement, public security personnel across the country closely integrated with the current production tasks and did good deeds for the masses. Many public security personnel helped the masses with winter plowing and manure accumulation, water conservancy construction, short-distance transportation, street cleaning, and bridge and road repairs; some, undaunted by difficulties, helped the masses with disaster relief and rescuing the distressed, and providing assistance to the poor; some public security personnel combined their own work to do good deeds for the masses, such as fire-fighting police combining fire prevention publicity to help residents plug fire hazards; traffic police helping the elderly and children cross the road, forming a trend; household registration police seeking relatives and friends for people and finding addresses. All of this moved the masses very much. According to statistics from the Hebei Provincial Public Security Department, public security personnel throughout the province have accumulated more than 8 million catties of fertilizer, dug more than 5,000 cubic meters of canals, and assisted in more than 39,000 short-distance transportations to date. Public security personnel in Hohhot cleared garbage and delivered manure for factories, enterprises, and suburban people's communes, and did more than 81,000 good deeds in a few days. The Kexiang Police Station in Nanjing City conducted a general inspection of residents' stoves, chimneys, wires, doors and windows, etc., and immediately organized police officers to carry out emergency repairs when they found unsafe phenomena, and successively built stoves and plugged fire hazards for the masses in more than 100 cases. Zhao Guangren, a household registration policeman from the Chengguan Police Station in Lingbi County, Anhui Province, saw that resident Cao Xinfang was seriously ill and urgently needed a blood transfusion, so he actively transfused 250 cc of blood, turning the patient from danger to safety. The street public security committee members in Shenyang City did tens of thousands of good deeds for the masses, making the Love-the-People activities spread to every corner.

The characteristic of this year's movement is that leading cadres of public security organs, like ordinary police officers, were involved in the Love-the-People Month movement. Before the Spring Festival, Beijing had continuous heavy snow, and all the cadres of the Ministry of Public Security, led by the Minister and Vice Ministers, went out to sweep snow in the wind and snow on January 19th. They cleaned the snow on the streets from Tiananmen Square to Nanheyan, which was convenient for vehicles and pedestrians to pass through. The director of the Henan Provincial Public Security Department led all the cadres of the agency to Zhengzhou Railway Station on January 17 to help railway employees clean up, clear warehouses, and help passengers carry luggage. They did more than 7,000 good deeds for the masses in one afternoon. The director, deputy director, and many directors and bureau chiefs cleaned the incoming passenger cars, which moved the railway employees and passengers very much. On the same day, the female cadres of the Henan Provincial Public Security Department also went to the Yellow River Gangli Water Conservancy Construction Site to send more than 200 pairs of shoes donated by the cadres of the entire department to the migrant workers; they brought needles and thread to sew and mend for the migrant workers on the spot, and some comrades took off their cotton clothes and put them on the migrant workers while sewing and mending clothes for the migrant workers, which greatly moved the migrant workers, and they became more motivated when repairing water conservancy.

The development of the Love-the-People Month movement has further strengthened the ties between public security personnel and the people. The broad masses of people have enthusiastically praised the public security personnel who wholeheartedly serve the people by writing letters of condolence, posting big-character posters, and writing poems. In the past few days, residents of Guiyang City have created more than 100 poems and clappes to praise public security personnel. One of the mountain songs wrote: "The people's police love the people, close as a family, it is difficult to look back on the past before liberation, two kinds of society, two kinds of people." Public security personnel in Shenyang City received more than 7,600 letters of praise and big-character posters from the masses in ten days. On the message book at Zhengzhou Railway Station, one passenger wrote: "On Sunday, January 17, public security personnel came to the station, if you ask them what they are doing, they are happily engaged in Love-the-People work, wiping glass, wiping the floor, answering questions and publicizing, smiling at passengers, helping the old and carrying the young, carrying luggage, the passengers are happy to see it, praising the people's service personnel, why are the police so good, it is all thanks to the good leadership of the Party." Public security personnel love the people, and the people actively support and assist the public security personnel to jointly do a good job in public security and defense. Through the Love-the-People Month activities, the revolutionary vigilance of the people in Fujian has become higher, and they have actively assisted the public security organs in cracking down on counter-revolutionary cases. With the assistance of the masses, the Chengguan Police Station of the Qingning County Public Security Bureau captured two counter-revolutionary elements who had fled from other places. Due to the development of the Love-the-People Month movement and close contact with the masses, the mass public security organizations of the Chengguan Brigade of the Chengguan Commune in Leting County, Hebei Province, the commune members actively exposed the sabotage activities of bad elements to the public security committee members, and one commune member also reported the hiding place of a Japanese puppet secret agent who had been absconding for many years.

    广泛征求意见改进工作　紧密结合生产大办好事
    公安人员爱民月运动步步深入
    新的特点：各级领导干部带头参加，群众治安积极分子同时卷入
    新华社1日讯　1960年春节期间，全国各地公安机关普遍开展了爱民月运动，取得了很大成绩，进一步密切了公安人员同人民群众的联系，到处出现了警爱民、民爱警的新风气，警民关系犹如水乳交融。
    全国各地公安机关在春节前后普遍开展爱民运动，是从1959年春节开始的。这是我国公安工作大走群众路线的一个新创造，也是我国人民警察继承和发扬中国人民解放军的密切同人民群众联系的优良传统的一种方法。除了经常注意联系群众，接受群众的监督外，通过这样一个运动，全国公安人员广泛地征求群众意见，集中地开展自我批评，改进作风，并且主动地为人民群众大办好事，这样就使公安机关进一步得到群众的监督和支持，充分显示了人民警察的本质。
    今年春节期间的爱民月运动，比去年开展得更加广泛，更加深入，内容更加生动和具有成效。既在基层单位和广大民警中进行，也在领导机关和公安干部中进行，甚至群众性的治安保卫组织中的群众积极分子也踊跃参加了这个运动。许多地方的爱民月活动，遍及各个角落，好人好事大量涌现。据广州、武汉、天津、沈阳、重庆、郑州、贵阳、长春、西宁等市和山东、福建等省最近的统计，公安人员在爱民月运动中为人民办的好事达二百八十多万件。
    在爱民月运动中，各地公安人员普遍以公安人员的八大纪律十项注意为主要内容，结合本地区工作的实际情况，进行了热烈的讨论，一面表扬好人好事，一面展开批评和自我批评，进一步提高思想，改进作风。许多地方的公安人员还召开了各种会议，向居民报告工作，或者登门拜访，张贴大字报，广泛征求群众的意见。上海市各公安分局派出所，普遍向所辖地区的群众汇报了工作，征求群众的意见。山东济南市公安人员到1月25日为止，已召开大小型群众会议四百五十多次，登门访问一万七千多次，这样就使他们广泛地接触了群众，听取了群众的意见和要求。各地群众以主人翁的态度，积极提出意见，特别是热情地赞扬公安人员的优良作风。南京市公安人员开展爱民月运动以来，收到了两万多封表扬信，还接到群众提出的二千四百多条建议和批评意见。人民群众当面对公安干部和人民警察提出批评，这在旧社会是闻所未闻的事情。贵阳市人民在衷心赞扬公安人员的同时，对民警工作中的缺点提出批评意见四百五十七条。有的居民在座谈会上指名批评个别民警作风上的缺点。受到批评的个别公安人员，都诚恳地接受群众意见，有的还登门向提意见的群众作自我检讨。郑州市中原路派出所原来执行制度比较机械，强调学习时间不办公，遇到紧要的事也不受理，群众提出批评意见。现在这个派出所已改为随来随办和登门办理户口的办法，得到了群众的好评。
    全国各地公安人员，在爱民月运动中，紧密结合当前的生产任务，为群众大办好事。许多公安人员帮助群众冬耕积肥、兴修水利、短途运输、清扫街道、修桥补路；有的不畏困难帮助群众抢灾救险，济困扶危；有的公安人员结合本身业务为群众大办好事，如消防民警结合防火宣传，帮助居民堵塞火险；交通民警扶老携幼过马路，形成风气；户籍民警代人寻亲觅友，查找地址。所有这一切，都使群众十分感动。据河北省公安厅统计，全省公安人员到目前为止，已积肥八百多万斤，挖渠五千多土方，协助短途运输三万九千多次。呼和浩特市公安人员为工厂企业和郊区人民公社清除垃圾、送粪，几天内就办了八万一千多件好事。南京市科巷派出所对居民的炉灶、烟囱、电线、门窗等普遍进行了检查，发现不安全现象，立即组织民警进行抢修，先后为群众修建炉灶、堵塞火险等一百多件。安徽灵璧县城关派出所户籍警赵广仁，看到居民曹新芳病势严重，急需输血，就主动输血两百五十西西，使病人转危为安。沈阳市街道治安保卫委员们为群众办了几万件好事，使爱民活动遍及各个角落。
    今年运动的特点是公安机关的领导干部，同普通民警一样地卷入了爱民月运动。春节前，北京连日大雪，公安部全体干部在部长和各位副部长的率领下，在1月19日整天冒着风雪外出扫雪。他们把天安门前到南河沿一带街道上的积雪打扫得干干净净，以便利车辆和行人的通行。河南省公安厅厅长率领全体机关干部，在1月17日到郑州车站帮助铁路员工打扫卫生，清理仓库，帮旅客搬运行李，他们在一个下午为群众办了七千多件好事。厅长、副厅长同许多处长和局长们，将进站的一列列客车都擦得干干净净，使铁路员工和旅客们很受感动。就在这一天，河南省公安厅的女干部，还一起到黄河岗里水利工地，给民工送去了全厅干部捐献的二百多双鞋；她们带了针线就地给民工们缝缝补补，在给民工缝补衣服时，有的同志脱下自己的棉衣给民工穿上，这使民工们大为感动，他们在修水利时更加鼓起了干劲。
    爱民月运动的开展，进一步密切了公安人员同人民群众的联系。广大人民纷纷以写慰问信、贴大字报、编写诗歌等方式，热情地赞扬全心全意为人民服务的公安人员。贵阳市的居民在最近几天里，创作了一百多首诗歌和快板来表扬公安人员。其中一首山歌写道：“人民警察爱人民，亲亲密密一家人，解放前事难回首，两种社会两种人。”沈阳市公安人员在十天内，收到群众表扬信、大字报等七千六百多件。在郑州车站的留言簿上，一位旅客这样写道：“元月十七星期天，公安人员到车站，要问他们干什么，爱民工作搞得欢，擦玻璃擦地板，解答问题搞宣传，见旅客笑开颜，扶老携幼行李搬，旅客见了心欢喜，称赞人民勤务员，民警为何这样好，都是党的好领导。”公安人员热爱人民，人民也积极支持和协助公安人员，共同搞好治安保卫工作。福建人民通过爱民月活动，革命警惕性更高了，积极协助公安机关破获反革命案件。清宁县公安局城关派出所，在群众协助下捕获了从外地逃来的两个反革命分子。河北省乐亭县城关公社城关大队的群众治安保卫组织，由于开展了爱民月运动，密切了同群众的联系，社员们主动向治安保卫委员们揭发了坏分子的破坏活动，有一个社员还检举了一个常年潜逃在外的日伪特务头子的匿藏地址。
