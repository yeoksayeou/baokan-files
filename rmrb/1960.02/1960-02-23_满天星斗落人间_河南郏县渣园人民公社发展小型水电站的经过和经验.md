    Stars All Over the World Fall to Earth
    —The Development and Experience of Small Hydropower Stations in Zhayuan People's Commune, Jia County, Henan—
    Li Bingkai, Sun Deju, Xie Shuiwang, Guo Lang

    Today, standing on the scenic Fenghuang Ridge west of Jia County, Henan, and looking out over Zhayuan Commune, one can see thirty-two cascade-style small hydropower stations standing there, with power lines extending from these power stations, encircling every village. During the day, machines roar; at night, lights shine brightly, as if stars have fallen from the sky to the earth.

    Zhayuan People's Commune is located on the eastern foot of the Funiu Mountains and belongs to the Huai River Basin. The commune has seventy natural villages, 5,861 households, 26,248 people, and 63,400 mu of cultivated land. It has good natural conditions for developing water conservancy and building hydropower stations. Bordering the Ru River to the south and relying on the Huolong Mountain to the north, the Qinglong River and Ji River run through the entire territory from north to south. The three rivers wind around sixty-six villages, with abundant water sources and a relatively large slope from north to south. However, during the years of reactionary class rule, these superior natural conditions not only failed to produce benefits but, on the contrary, brought profound disasters to the people. The three rivers flooded every year. When it rained, floods breached the dikes and overflowed the entire township; when it didn't rain, the riverbeds dried up, and there wasn't a drop of water. Over time, year after year, tens of thousands of mu of fertile land were washed into strange shapes, and farmers toiled all year round but could hardly get enough to eat. For many years, a ballad circulated in this area:

    No rain, drought; rain, flooding,
    The people get poorer and poorer;
    Northern hills dry, southern depressions waterlogged,
    When will the five grains be abundant?

    Before liberation, not to mention electric lights, more than 3,000 households couldn't even afford oil lamps. The commune members said that they lived a life of "using the moon as a light and spreading a hemp stalk as a bed."

        Small Cooperation Cannot Adapt to the Great Leap Forward

    After liberation, Zhayuan Township quickly changed its face, production increased year by year, and life became increasingly prosperous.

    In 1952, with the vigorous development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, under the leadership of the Party, the people of Zhayuan Township began their first struggle in history to conquer nature and turn water disasters into water conservancy. Because cooperatives had much more manpower, materials, and financial resources than individual farming, they relied on collective strength to build canals to block floods and store water. After several years of hard work, by 1957, the township had completed two reservoirs, storing 540,000 cubic meters of water, excavated a large canal fifteen li long, and dug 1,500 wells, bringing the irrigated area to 40,000 mu, accounting for 70% of the total cultivated land. As a result, agricultural output increased year by year. In 1956, the average yield per mu reached more than 321 jin, more than four times higher than before liberation.

    However, regardless of whether it was a primary or advanced cooperative, due to its small scale, manpower, and materials were not concentrated, and land could not be uniformly planned; economic strength was not so strong that not only could many large and medium-sized water conservancy projects not be undertaken, but even those that had been built were mostly each village taking care of its own, and each cooperative taking care of its own, unable to be fully utilized.

    In the spring of 1958, the Party Central Committee issued a great call for vigorously developing agricultural water conservancy. Zhayuan Township ushered in an unprecedented large-scale upsurge in water conservancy construction. At the same time, the Sijie Advanced Cooperative and the Liu Village Advanced Cooperative proposed plans to build small hydropower stations using natural water level differences. However, due to lack of funds, insufficient labor, and conflicts between upstream and downstream, they were not built. The original Sijie Cooperative planned to build a 15-horsepower power station. The entire construction project, plus the renovation of the canal, required 12,000 laborers and 2,100 yuan to purchase motors and electrical materials. After all calculations, the cooperative had only 145 laborers and 1,300 yuan in public funds. The plan to build a hydropower station was still not easy to achieve. Although the Liu Village Advanced Cooperative was a relatively large cooperative in the township, with more manpower, materials, and financial resources than the Sijie Cooperative, the tailwater canal for the power station had to pass through the Lin Village Advanced Cooperative. The members of the Lin Village Cooperative said, "If you build a power station, you will destroy our land, that won't do!" As a result, they only dug a pit and stopped working. Therefore, at that time, people generally felt that small cooperation was no longer possible, so they successively proposed to the township Party committee to merge small cooperatives into large cooperatives. According to the unanimous demands of the masses and the new situation of the Great Leap Forward, in May 1958, the forty advanced cooperatives in the township were merged into the People's Commune.

    The Commune Makes a Preliminary Show of Strength, and the Power Station Shines Brightly

    After the establishment of the People's Commune, by October 1959, fifty large and small reservoirs had been built, storing 4.08 million cubic meters of water, 182 ponds were built, storing 910,000 cubic meters of water, and three rivers were dredged, and five diversion canals were dug, making the 63,400 mu of cultivated land in the commune realize self-flowing irrigation, and also providing extremely favorable conditions for the development of rural electrification.

    As soon as the People's Commune was established, it began the construction of small hydropower stations. The commune Party committee decided to first conduct two pilot projects, one site was selected at the old site surveyed by the original Liu Village Advanced Cooperative, and the other was selected on the Ershilipu irrigation canal leading from the Ru River.

    Relying on the superiority of the People's Commune's "large size and high degree of public ownership," the commune Party committee first concentrated a thousand-person army to renovate the canal, and transferred 10,000 bricks and 20,000 tiles from the Zhaozhuang Brigade, collected enough wood, and allocated 10,000 yuan as construction funds.

    After the power station was built, in order to generate electricity as soon as possible, the people who built the power station were not afraid of any difficulties and dared to think and act. When installing, they used wooden frames instead of cement for the motor base; they used rack car wheels to transform the missing wire winding machine; they repaired a broken cabinet for the missing distribution panel; and they climbed the poles barefoot because they did not have climbing spurs. They finally overcame many difficulties, spent only 6,500 yuan, and used 20 days to build two small hydropower stations with a power generation capacity of 32 kilowatts. At the same time, through pilot projects, they also explored a set of experiences: self-construction and self-use, self-reliance, adapting to local conditions, and using local materials; without complex technological processes; simple equipment, easy to install, and quickly put into production.

    On June 11, 1958, the Liu Village Power Station generated electricity! Electricity not only illuminated the countryside but also illuminated the hearts of the peasants.

      The Commune Shows Its Power, and the Masses Create Miracles

    Breaking the mysterious view of running electricity brought unlimited confidence and strength to the vast number of commune members and cadres. Villages and teams successively requested the establishment of power stations in their villages.

    In order to strengthen the leadership of the construction of power stations, the commune Party committee established a hydropower headquarters. According to the spirit of "overall planning and comprehensive utilization," when selecting each hydropower station site, overall planning and unified arrangements were made for flood prevention, irrigation, and transportation. During the movement, the policy of "small-scale as the main, commune-run as the main, production as the main, water conservancy as the main, and indigenous methods as the main" was resolutely implemented, and based on the principle of "unified allocation of labor and technology, unified use of funds and raw materials," 110,000 yuan was raised from major brigades as construction funds. At the same time, 700 laborers and 120 masons were transferred to form a construction professional team, and 70 carpenters were concentrated to establish a water turbine manufacturing plant. Because building power stations was the urgent demand of the masses, the vast number of commune members also put forward the slogan of "Everyone does things for everyone, contributing effort, offering plans, and investing money," offering capital and exchanging materials, forming a heat wave. In the commune, in the first month of construction alone, commune members invested 23,000 yuan and a large amount of raw materials. With funds and building materials, the construction work was like a spring rain overnight, blooming everywhere. Thirty small hydropower stations in the commune started construction in full swing. Demobilized soldiers Xie Dongyou, Ma Shanyi, and Yang Xitang led more than 30 militiamen and backbone company members to build a 21-kilowatt "August 1st" hydropower station in Yangzhuang; middle school students built a 4.2-kilowatt "Young Pioneers" hydropower station in Houzhayuan; headed by Deputy Township Chief Lin Shuiye (female), seventeen girls, with the help of commune member Zhou Fawa, who had participated in the pilot power station construction, measured, designed, drew drawings, and built themselves, and built a 5.6-kilowatt "Eight Sisters and Nine Sisters" hydropower station in Duzhuang in ten days. There are also "Happiness" hydropower stations, "Communist Youth League" hydropower stations, "Surpassing England" hydropower stations, "Huang Zhong" hydropower stations, and so on.

    With the full-scale construction of hydropower stations, the difficulty of insufficient technical force was first encountered. According to this situation, the commune Party committee promptly convened a "Three Craftsmen" (iron, wood, and mud) meeting, absorbed graduates from primary and secondary schools to participate, and conducted on-site training with more than a dozen people who had participated in the pilot construction work of Liuzhuang and Ershilipu. A method of masters leading apprentices and overall blossoming was adopted, with the construction site as the classroom, the project as the teaching material, combining theory with practice, teaching by pointing at objects, training troops on the position, speaking and doing, learning while doing, teaching one person to teach ten people, and ten people teaching hundreds of people, quickly popularizing technical experience and technical knowledge. In order to continuously improve the station construction technology of the commune members, the commune Party committee also established a Red and Expert School, with water conservancy and hydropower departments, giving regular lectures and imparting technology. At the same time, a technical guidance group was organized to provide specific help and guidance. Through guidance, problems were discovered and solved in a timely manner, ensuring the smooth progress of station construction.

    The second difficulty encountered in the construction was the lack of lime and cement. According to the plan, the construction of power stations and sluices alone required more than 100 tons of cement, 3,600 tons of lime, and 1.9 million blue bricks. At that time, the commune only had four brick and tile kilns and two lime kilns. What to do? There were two ways: one was to purchase outside; the other was to rely on self-reliance. The first one was not in line with the spirit of running electricity thriftily, and it was not certain that purchasing from other places would be able to achieve satisfactory results and solve all problems. Therefore, the commune Party committee decided to take the second path. They put forward the slogan of "Break superstition, dare to think and dare to do, self-manufacture and self-use, self-reliance." 280 people were drawn from the commune to establish a cement plant, expand ten blue brick kilns and two lime kilns, to ensure the needs of station construction and sluice repair.

    After the difficulties of insufficient raw materials were solved, the construction speed leaped again and again, and many astonishing speeds of "one day of design, five days of construction, and seven days of power generation" appeared. After all the power stations were completed, new problems arose. One was that there were few generators, and some power stations could not be installed and generate electricity in time; the other was that according to book regulations, rural hydropower stations used No. 8 iron wire for power transmission, and the longest distance could not exceed 500 meters, while most stations were about 800 to 1,500 meters away from the surrounding villages. Without transformers, it was obviously impossible to transmit electricity. Was there any way? Party Secretary Sun Deju said to everyone: "Three cobblers are equal to one Zhuge Liang. As long as we dare to think and dare to do, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome." Therefore, a competition climax of invention and creation was quickly launched in each power station. People who had participated in the pilot construction of power stations in Liuzhuang and Ershilipu, according to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, broke with convention, boldly transformed and manufactured, and successfully trial-produced asynchronous generators using old motors and adding capacitors, saving 55% of the cost of buying a synchronous generator, while the effect was the same. Then, they used No. 8 iron wire side by side to erect two, and according to the principle of erecting telephone lines, added a ground wire, and successfully trial-produced a "one-line and one-ground system" of power transmission, replacing the transformer.

    By the eve of National Day in 1959, all thirty-two hydropower stations had been completed. The total load was 850 horsepower, and the power generation reached 282 kilowatts. In addition to supplying power for industrial and agricultural production, these power stations also installed electric lights in 4,500 households in 48 villages, enabling more than 70% of the commune's households to have electric lighting.

      With Hydropower Stations, Production Develops Greatly

    Small hydropower stations—the bright pearls of the countryside—fully demonstrated their power and superiority in improving production efficiency, accelerating agricultural mechanization, and promoting agricultural production.

    With electricity, automation and semi-automation were brought to the processing of most agricultural products. The heavy manual labor inherited from history, such as livestock pulling mills, foot-pedal cotton gins, and pounding corn with mallets, has been replaced by hydraulic power and electricity, which has basically overcome the difficulties of insufficient labor and animal power in rural areas. In the past, the commune often needed 350 people and the same number of livestock to grind flour, but now only 22 technicians are needed to take care of the machines. Women happily said: Communization ran out of the kitchen, and electrification ran out of the mill, and we women are completely liberated. In the autumn of 1958, it was the busy season for large-scale water conservancy, large-scale steelmaking, autumn harvesting, and autumn planting, which required both labor and time. At this critical juncture, hydropower stations showed great power, not only supplying lighting for night production but also driving steel mills, cotton gins, cotton carding machines, threshing machines, etc. for production, greatly saving labor. From September to December of this year, the commune only dispatched 50 laborers to gin cotton and grind flour. In addition to ensuring self-sufficiency in eating flour, it also processed 3.6 million jin of grain, 120,000 jin of ginned cotton, and 40,000 jin of carded cotton for the state in four months, earning 57,600 yuan in processing fees.

    With electricity, commune-run industries gained power and developed very rapidly. Various production indicators and product quality continued to improve day by day. The "dead machines" that could not be used in the past due to insufficient power have become living machines, and many parts that could not be produced before can now be produced. Taking the production of the commune-run machinery factory as an example, the sand casting workshop used to use livestock to pull blowers, the wind was small, the temperature was low, and only a little over 100 jin of molten iron could be melted at a time, and the quality was not high. Many larger parts could not be cast. After using electric blowers, the first furnace cast a steam engine pulley weighing 1,500 jin for the Jingjiawa Coal Mine run by the county, enabling a 300-horsepower steam engine that had been out of service for three months to be put back into production. With electricity as power, labor was freed up, enabling commune-run industries to develop rapidly. By November 1959, 25 large and small factories and mines, 116 in total, had been established for iron smelting, machinery, coal mines, cement, refractory materials, etc. The total industrial output value for the year reached 840,000 yuan, an increase of 57.6% compared to 1958.

    With electricity, agricultural production was also promoted. The "Eight-Character Constitution" of agricultural production has been more deeply and concretely implemented. Agricultural work has become more and more refined, and various tasks such as plowing, planting, plowing, harrowing, fertilizing, and watering can be completed on time with guaranteed quality and quantity. Since most of the processing of agricultural and sideline products and industrial production used electricity, the freed-up labor strengthened the front line of agricultural production, which ensured the early completion of agricultural production tasks. Taking wheat planting as an example, 50,000 mu of wheat were sown in 1959, which was completed in only six days, exceeding the quota by 2,000 mu. In 1957, the wheat planting task was only 42,000 mu, but it took half a month. At the same time, farming has also become more meticulous. In 1959, the deep plowing area for wheat sowing reached 98%, an increase of 49% compared to 1958.

    The commune members of Zhayuan Commune, who are full of confidence in building socialism, will never be satisfied with the status quo. In order to realize agricultural modernization as soon as possible, it is planned that by the summer of 1960, the number of hydropower stations in the commune will be expanded to sixty, and the motor capacity will be increased to 1,500 kilowatts.

    满天星斗落人间
    ——河南郏县渣园人民公社发展小型水电站的经过和经验——
    李炳凯　孙德聚　谢水旺　郭朗
    如今，登上河南郏县城西的风光岭，眺望渣园公社，可以看到那里矗立着三十二座串珠式的小型水电站，从这些发电站伸展出去的电线网，环绕着每个村庄。白天机器轰鸣；入夜灯火辉映，好似满天星斗坠落人间。
    渣园人民公社位于伏牛山东麓，属淮河流域。全社七十个自然村，五千八百六十一户，二万六千二百四十八口人，耕地六万三千四百亩。这里有着发展水利灌溉和兴建水力电站的良好自然条件。南临汝河，北靠火龙山，青龙河和冀河，自北而南贯穿全境，三条河流盘绕六十六个村庄，水源充足，地势北高南低，坡降较大。然而，在反动阶级统治的年代里，这些优越的自然条件，不但没有发挥效益，相反，给人们带来了深重的灾难。三条河流年年泛滥，逢雨，洪水决堤，漫溢全乡；不雨，河身干枯，滴水也无。日积月累，年复一年，几万亩良田，被冲得奇形怪状，农民终年劳动难得温饱。多少年来在这一带就流传着这样一首歌谣：
    无雨干旱有雨冲，百姓越过越贫穷；
    北岗旱来南洼涝，何时五谷才丰登？
    解放以前，不要说电灯，有三千多户人家连油灯都点不起，社员们说，那时候过的是：“拿住月亮当灯光，点根麻秆来铺床。”的日子。
        小合作不能适应大跃进
    解放后，渣园乡迅速地改变了面貌，生产逐年提高，生活日益富裕。
    1952年，随着互助合作运动的蓬勃发展，在党的领导下，渣园乡人民开始了历史上第一次征服自然、变水患为水利的斗争。由于合作社比单干时，人力、物力、财力都大多了，他们就依靠集体力量，修渠拦洪蓄水。经过几年的奋战，到1957年全乡完成了两座水库，蓄水五十四万公方，开挖了一条长达十五华里的大渠，打井一千五百眼，使水浇地面积达到了四万亩，占耕地总面积的70％。因而农业产量逐年上升。1956年平均亩产量达到三百二十一斤多，比解放前提高了四倍多。
    但是，不论初级社或高级社，由于规模小，人力、物力不集中，土地不能统一规划；经济力量还不是那么雄厚，不但许多大中型的水利工程不能兴办，就是已经修起来的，也多是各村顾各村，一社顾一社，不能充分地利用。
    1958年春天，党中央发出了关于大兴农田水利的伟大号召。渣园乡掀起了空前的大规模的水利建设高潮。与此同时，寺街高级社和刘庄高级社提出了利用自然水跌差，修建小型水力发电站的计划。但是由于资金少、劳力不足和上下游的矛盾，而没有建成。原来寺街社计划建一座十五马力的发电站，全部建站工程，加上整修渠道，需一万二千个劳动力，还需要有购买电机和电料的费用二千一百元，而满打满算，全社只有一百四十五个劳动力和一千三百元的公积金，建水电站的计划还是不易实现。刘庄高级社虽然是全乡比较大的社，人力、物力、财力都比寺街社充足，但因修电站尾水渠道要经过林村高级社，林村社的社员们说：“你们建电站，毁俺的地，那可不行！”结果只挖了一个坑就停工了。因此当时人们普遍感到小合作已经不行了，于是纷纷向乡党委提出要并小社为大社。根据群众的一致要求和大跃进的新形势，1958年5月，全乡四十个高级社合并为人民公社。
    公社小试锋芒　电站大放光芒
    人民公社成立后，到1959年10月，修起了大小水库五十座，蓄水四百零八万公方，修水塘一百八十二个，蓄水九十一万公方，还整理河道三条，挖引河渠五条，使全社六万三千四百亩耕地实现了灌溉自流化，而且也为发展农村电气化事业提供了极为有利的条件。
    人民公社一成立，就开始了兴建小型水力发电站的工程，公社党委决定先搞两个试点，站址一个选在原刘庄高级社勘查的旧址，一个选在二十里铺引汝灌溉渠上。
    依靠人民公社“一大二公”的优越性，公社党委首先集中了一千人的整修渠道大军，并从赵庄大队抽调一万块砖和二万片瓦，搜集了足够的木料，拨款一万元作为建站经费。
    电站建成后，为了早日放电，建电站的人们不怕一切困难，敢想敢干。在进行安装时，没有水泥做电机座，他们改用木架代替；没有落线机，就用架子车轮改制；没有配电盘，用破面柜改修；架线没有脚扒，他们干脆赤脚往杆子上爬。他们终于克服了重重困难，只花费六千五百元，用了二十天时间，建成了两座发电能力达三十二瓩的小型水力发电站。同时，经过试点，也摸索出一套经验：自建自用，自力更生，因地制宜，就地取材；不用复杂的工艺过程；设备简单，易于安装，迅速投入生产。
    1958年6月11日，刘庄发电站放电了！电，不仅照亮了农村，也照亮了农民的心。
      公社显威力　群众创奇迹
    打破了办电的神秘观点，给广大社员和干部带来了无限的信心和力量。各村各队纷纷要求在本村建立电站。
    为了加强对建设发电站的领导，公社党委成立了水电指挥部，根据“全面规划综合利用”的精神，在选择每一个水电站地址时，对防洪、灌溉和交通等，都进行了全面规划统一安排。在运动中坚决贯彻了“以小型为主、社办为主、生产为主、水利为主、土法为主”的方针，并本着“劳动力、技术统一调配，资金、原料统一使用”的原则，从各大队筹集了十一万元，作为建站经费。同时抽调了七百个劳动力和一百二十个泥水匠，组成了建站专业队，集中了七十个木工，成立了水轮机制造厂。由于建电站是群众的迫切要求，广大社员也提出了“大家的事大家办，有力出力，有计献计，有钱投资”的口号，献资兑料，一时形成了热潮。全社仅建站初期的一个月当中，社员就投资二万三千元和大量原材料。有了资金和建筑材料，建站工作如同一夜春雨，遍地开花。全社三十个小型水力发电站全面动工。转业军人谢东友、马善义、杨喜堂，带领民兵基干连的三十多人，在杨庄建立了一座二十一瓩的“八一”水力发电站；中学的学生在后渣园建立一座四点二瓩的“红领巾”水电站；以副乡长林水叶（女）为首的十七个姑娘，在曾参加过试点建站的社员周法娃帮助下，自己测量，自己设计，自己绘图，自己修建，用十天的时间，在杜庄建立一座五点六瓩的“八姐九妹”水电站。其它还有“幸福”水电站、“共青”水电站、“超英”水电站、“黄忠”水电站等等。
    随着水电站的全面施工，首先碰到了技术力量不足的困难。公社党委根据这一情况，及时召开了“三匠”（铁、木、泥）会议，吸收中小学毕业生参加，以参加过刘庄、二十里铺试点建站工作的十几个人为主，进行了现场训练。采取了以师带徒，全面开花的办法，以工地为课堂，以工程为教材，理论结合实际，指物教学，阵地练兵，讲什么作什么，边做、边教、边学，一人教十人，十人教百人，很快普及了技术经验和技术知识。为使社员的建站技术不断提高，公社党委又成立了一所红专学校，分设水利、水电系，定期讲课，传授技术。同时还组织了技术辅导团，进行具体帮助和指导。通过辅导，及时发现问题，及时加以解决，保证了建站工作的顺利进行。
    在施工中，遇到的第二个困难是缺少石灰、水泥。按照规划，仅修建电站和水闸，就需要水泥一百多吨、石灰三千六百吨、青砖一百九十万块。而当时全社只有四个砖瓦窑和两个白灰窑。怎么办呢？道路有两条：一条是出外采购；一条是自力更生。而第一条既不符合勤俭办电的精神，到外地购买也不一定能够如愿以偿，全部解决。因此，公社党委决定走第二条道路。提出了“破除迷信，敢想敢干，自制自用，自力更生”的口号。从全社抽出二百八十人，建立了一座水泥厂，扩建了青砖窑十个和白灰窑两个，保证了建站和修水闸的需要。
    原材料不足的困难解决后，建站速度一跃再跃，出现了许多“一日设计，五日施工，七日发电”的惊人速度。全部电站落成后，新的问题又出来了。一个是发电机少，有些电站不能及时安装发电；一个是按书本规定，农村水电站用八号铁丝输电，最长距离不能超过五百米，而大部分站离周围村庄又都在八百到一千五百米左右，没有变压器显然不能送电。有没有办法呢？党委书记孙德聚对大家说：“三个臭皮匠，顶上个诸葛亮，只要我们敢想敢干，没有克服不了的困难。”于是各电站迅速展开了发明创造的竞赛高潮。原来参加过刘庄和二十里铺修建电站试点的人，依照苏联的先进经验，打破常规，大胆改制，用旧马达，加装上电容器，试制成功了异步发电机，比买一部同步发电机的费用节约55％，而效果一样。接着，他们又用八号铁丝并排架两根，按照架电话线的原理，加上地线，试制成功了“一线一地制”的输电法，代替了变压器。
    到1959年国庆节前夕，三十二座水力发电站全部建成了。共负荷八百五十马力，发电量达二百八十二瓩，这些发电站除供应工农业生产作动力外，还有四十八个村庄的四千五百户社员安上了电灯，使全社70％以上的人家有了电力照明。
      有了水电站　生产大发展
    小型发电站——农村的夜明珠，充分显示了它在提高生产效率、加速农业机械化和促进农业生产发展的威力和优越性。
    有了电，为大部分农村产品加工带来了自动化和半自动化。历史上遗传下来的牲口拉磨、脚蹬轧花和棒棰砸玉米等笨重的体力劳动，已被水力和电力所代替，基本上克服了农村劳动力和畜力不足的困难。过去全社的人吃面，经常要用三百五十个人和相同数量的畜力来磨，现在只需要二十二个技术员看管机器就行了。妇女们高兴地说：公社化跑出了厨房，电气化跑出了磨房，俺妇女算彻底解放了。1958年秋季，正是大搞水利、大办钢铁和秋收秋种的紧张季节，既需要劳动力，又需要时间。在这紧要的关头，水力发电站大显威风，除供应夜间生产照明外，还带动钢磨、轧花机、弹花机、脱粒机等等进行生产，大大节约了劳动力。这一年9月到12月，全社只抽出五十个劳动力轧花和磨面，除保证吃面自足外，四个月还为国家加工粮食三百六十万斤，轧花十二万斤，弹花四万斤，收入加工费五万七千六百元。
    有了电，社办工业获得了动力，发展十分迅速。各项生产指标和产品质量不断提高，日日向上。过去因动力不足而没有使用的“死机器”，都变成了活机器，许多以前不能生产的机件现在可以生产了。以社办机械厂的生产为例，翻砂车间，过去用牲口拉鼓风机，风小、温度低，一次熔化铁汁不过一百多斤，而且质量不高，很多较大的机件不能铸造。使用电力鼓风后，第一炉就为县办的景家洼煤矿铸造了一个重达一千五百斤的蒸汽机皮带轮，使景家洼煤矿停用了三个月的一部三百马力的蒸汽机重新投入了生产。有了电力做动力，腾出了劳动力，使社办工业迅速发展起来，到1959年11月，已经办起了炼铁、机械、煤矿、水泥、耐火材料等大小厂矿二十五项、一百一十六处，全年工业总产值达到八十四万元，较1958年增长57．6％。
    有了电，也促进了农业生产。农业生产的“八字宪法”得到了更深入、更具体的贯彻，农活越做越细，耕、种、犁、耙、施肥、浇水等各项任务都能保质保量地适时完成。由于农副产品加工和工业生产大部分使用了电力，腾出来的劳动力，加强了农业生产第一线，这就保证了农业生产任务的提前完成。拿种麦来说，1959年播麦五万亩，仅用六天时间就完成了，还超额二千亩。而1957年麦播任务只有四万二千亩，却用了半个月。同时，在耕作上也更加细致了。1959年麦播深翻面积达98％，比1958年提高49％。
    对建设社会主义充满信心的渣园公社社员，永远不会满足现状。为了尽快地实现农业现代化，计划到1960年夏季，全社水力发电站扩大到六十座，电机容量增加到一千五百瓩。
