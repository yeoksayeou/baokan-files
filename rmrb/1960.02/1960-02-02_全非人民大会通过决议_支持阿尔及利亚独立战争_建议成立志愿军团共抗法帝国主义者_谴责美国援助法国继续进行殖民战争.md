Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, January 31st. The Second Pan-African People's Conference, in its resolution on the Algerian question, extended its highest and fraternal respects to the heroic Algerian National Liberation Army fighters and to the Algerian people who are at the forefront of the anti-colonial struggle, and expressed its indignation at the heinous crimes committed day after day in Africa by the French invading forces.

The resolution said, "The Conference firmly supports the Algerian government's attitude in preparing to negotiate with the French government on the conditions for implementing the right to self-determination, and condemns the French government's delaying tactics and conspiracies aimed at continuing the war of aggression against the Algerian people."

The resolution also stated, "The Conference condemns the conspiracy to divide Algeria and insists on the principle of the integrity and indivisibility of Algerian territory."

Regarding the recent riots in Algiers, the resolution said, "This event demonstrates the complete failure of French policy and the incompetence of the French authorities. This situation poses a serious threat to the expansion of the conflict in North Africa and is also a threat to international security."

The resolution said that the conference decided "to recommend to the governments of independent African countries that they recognize the Algerian government and provide regular support to Algeria. The conference calls for the withdrawal from Algeria of the tens of thousands of black African soldiers under French control, and suggests the establishment of an African volunteer corps to support the Algerian war of independence. Finally, the conference issues an urgent appeal to the United Nations, requesting the United Nations to force the realization of peace in Algeria and the recognition of Algerian independence."

The Second Pan-African People's Conference also passed a telegram to the President of the United States and the United States Congress, condemning the United States for providing France with economic, military, and diplomatic assistance to support France's war of aggression.

The telegram said, "The conference notes once again that the United States' support for France's colonial policy has caused serious harm to the African people."

The telegram said, "The people of Africa solemnly call on you to abandon this harmful policy, which not only endangers the friendship and understanding between our peoples, but also endangers the cause of peace on the African continent and the world."

    全非人民大会通过决议
    支持阿尔及利亚独立战争
    建议成立志愿军团共抗法帝国主义者
    谴责美国援助法国继续进行殖民战争
    新华社突尼斯31日电　第二届全非人民大会在它通过的关于阿尔及利亚问题的决议中，向英勇的阿尔及利亚民族解放军战士、向处于反殖民主义斗争最前列的阿尔及利亚人民致以崇高的和兄弟般的敬意，并且表示对法国侵略军日复一日在非洲所犯的万恶罪行表示愤怒。
    决议说，“大会坚决支持阿尔及利亚政府为了着手同法国政府就实行自决权的条件进行谈判所采取的态度，并且谴责法国政府的拖延政策和旨在对阿尔及利亚人民继续进行侵略战争而玩弄的阴谋诡计。”
    决议还说，“大会谴责分割阿尔及利亚的阴谋，并坚持阿尔及利亚领土的完整和不可分割的原则。”
    关于最近在阿尔及尔发生的暴乱事件，决议说，“这一事件说明法国的政策一筹莫展，法国当局无能为力。这种形势造成对北非冲突扩大的严重威胁，也是对国际安全的威胁。”
    决议说，大会决定“向非洲各独立国家的政府建议承认阿尔及利亚政府并经常支援阿尔及利亚。大会要求从阿尔及利亚撤退在法国控制之下的数以万计的黑非洲士兵，并建议建立非洲志愿军军团来支援阿尔及利亚的独立战争。最后，大会向联合国发出迫切的呼吁，要求联合国强使实现阿尔及利亚的和平和承认阿尔及利亚的独立。”
    第二届全非人民大会还通过了打给美国总统和美国国会的电报，谴责美国在经济、军事和外交方面给予法国以援助，支持法国进行侵略战争。
    电报说，“大会再一次注意到，美国对法国的殖民政策的支持，给非洲人民带来了严重的损害。”
    电报说，“非洲各国人民郑重呼吁你们放弃这种有害的政策。这种政策不仅危害我们各国人民之间的友谊和谅解，而且危害非洲大陆和全世界的和平事业。”
