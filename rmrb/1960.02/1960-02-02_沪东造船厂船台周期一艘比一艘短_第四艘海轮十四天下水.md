Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Shanghai Hudong Shipyard is adhering to high speed and continuing the Great Leap Forward. Recently, another newly built 3,000-ton coastal freighter—Peace No. 63—completed its hull construction and was launched ahead of schedule.

	The dock assembly cycle for this freighter took only fourteen days, once again breaking the dock cycle record for similar freighters, winning the first victory of a good start to 1960.
	The dock cycle is the most important stage in building a hull. 70% of the workload for a new ship needs to be completed on the dock. Since last year, Hudong Shipyard has built four 3,000-ton freighters. The dock assembly speed has been faster with each ship, the quality has been better, the materials used have been more economical, and work-related injuries have been completely eliminated since the second ship, creating outstanding achievements of continuous and comprehensive leap forward. The dock cycles for these four freighters were sixty days, nineteen days, sixteen days, and fourteen days, respectively. The qualified rate of X-ray quality inspection of welding increased from a previous high of 96.9% to 97.3% for this ship. The qualified rate of total hull section connection even reached 100%. The number of workers building the fourth ship was one-sixth less than the third ship.
	Just as the hull was undergoing final assembly, a cold wave hit the banks of the Huangpu River. At this time, the shipbuilding workers wrote fourteen large characters on the side of the dock: "Strong determination breaks through myriad barriers; fervent hearts melt a thousand layers of ice!" They used umbrellas and canvas to block the wind and snow and continued welding. Leaders from the factory and workshops also came to the dock to work alongside the workers. In this way, they finally enabled the construction of this ship to create another miracle under very bad natural conditions and with fewer people than before.

    沪东造船厂船台周期一艘比一艘短
    第四艘海轮十四天下水
    据新华社讯　上海沪东造船厂坚持高速度、继续大跃进，最近又有一艘新建的载重三千吨的沿海货轮——和平六十三号完成船体建造工程，提前下水。
    这艘海轮的船台装配周期只用了十四天时间，又一次刷新了同类型海轮船台周期纪录，赢得了1960年开门红的第一个胜利。
    船台周期是建造船体最主要的阶段。一艘新船有70％的工作量需要在船台上完成。沪东造船厂去年以来已先后建造了四艘三千吨海轮，船台装配速度一艘比一艘快，质量一艘比一艘好，用料一艘比一艘省，工伤事故从第二艘开始已经全部消灭，创造了连续全面跃进的出色成就。这四艘海轮的船台周期，分别用了六十天、十九天、十六天、十四天；焊接X光质量检查合格率，从过去最高的96．9％提高到这一艘的97．3％，船体总段接连合格率更达到了100％；建造第四艘的工人，比第三艘又减少了六分之一。
    正当船体进行大合龙的时候，寒潮侵袭到黄浦江畔。这时，造船工人在船台边写了十四个大字：“劲足闯开万重关，心热融化千层冰！”他们用雨伞、帆布挡住风雪，继续电焊。厂和车间的领导干部也都来到船台上，同工人一起劳动。就这样，他们终于使这条船的建造，在自然条件很坏、人力比以往减少的情况下，再一次创造了奇迹。
