Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 24th: The two ships "Russia" and "Yakutia," dispatched by the Chinese government to Indonesia to transport displaced overseas Chinese back to their homeland, arrived today at Tanjung Priok Port in Jakarta. Officials from the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia boarded the ships to visit the personnel on board.

Ambassador Huang Zhen of China to Indonesia hosted a banquet at the Chinese Embassy tonight to entertain the crew and staff of these two ships.

The staff on board stated that they have prepared everything on the ships to receive the displaced overseas Chinese. They have laid carpets and done cleaning to ensure that the overseas Chinese can return to their motherland comfortably.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 24th: Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia Huang Zhen today visited more than 1,500 displaced overseas Chinese in Jakarta who are waiting for ships to return to China. These overseas Chinese arrived here yesterday and are staying in four different locations.

Accompanying Ambassador Huang Zhen on his visit were Zhao Zhengyi, Counselor of the Embassy, and Li Jusheng, Counselor and Consul General in Jakarta. They were warmly welcomed by the overseas Chinese everywhere they went. Ambassador Huang Zhen and the counselors visited the overseas Chinese from house to house and also visited the sick ward. Ambassador Huang Zhen and others also visited Luo Helin, who is over seventy years old and was beaten in Cimahi and then thrown onto a truck.

These displaced overseas Chinese have received warm reception and care from the Jakarta Chinese Associations Federation. Leaders of the Federation and their families are even cooking meals for these overseas Chinese. The reception center also has a clinic for these overseas Chinese, as well as a service office to handle various matters. These overseas Chinese, who have experienced several months of detention camp life during the anti-Chinese activities, are deeply moved by all this warm reception and care.

    我国第二批接运华侨轮船抵雅加达
    黄镇大使访问候船回国的一千多名侨胞
    新华社雅加达24日电　中国政府派往印度尼西亚接运流离失所的华侨回国的两艘轮船“俄罗斯号”和“亚库契亚号”今天到达雅加达的丹绒不碌港。中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆的官员登船访问了这两艘轮船上的人员。
    中国驻印度尼西亚大使黄镇今晚在中国大使馆设宴，招待这两艘轮船的船员和男女工作人员。
    船上的工作人员说，他们已把船上的一切准备就绪准备接运流离失所的华侨。他们已铺好地毯，做好清洁工作，使华侨们可以舒舒服服地回到祖国。
    新华社雅加达24日电　中国驻印度尼西亚大使黄镇今天访问了到这里候船回国的一千五百多名在排华活动中流离失所的华侨。这些华侨昨天到达这里，分住在四个地方。
    陪同黄镇大使去慰问的有大使馆参赞赵政一和参赞兼驻雅加达总领事李菊生。他们到处受到华侨们的热烈欢迎。黄镇大使和参赞挨家挨户地访问了这些华侨，并且访问了病房。黄镇大使等还访问了曾经在芝马拉野被打伤然后被抛上卡车的七十多岁的罗和粦。
    这些流离失所的华侨受到雅加达中华侨团总会的热情接待和照顾。中华侨团总会的领导人和他们的家属还替这些华侨煮饭。接待站还为这些华侨设有门诊部，以及代办各种事务的服务处。这些在排华活动中流离失所的华侨在经过几个月的拘留营生活之后，对于这一切热情的接待和照顾莫不深为感动。
