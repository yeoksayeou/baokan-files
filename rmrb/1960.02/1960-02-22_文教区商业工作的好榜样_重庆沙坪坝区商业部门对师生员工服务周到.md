Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing: The commercial department of Shapingba District, Chongqing, a major cultural district concentrated with schools, has comprehensively arranged the supply work for schools and organized the economic life of teachers, students, and staff based on the principles of serving teaching and facilitating the masses. This has greatly improved the commodity supply and service work in schools, and has been warmly praised by teachers and students.

Under the unified leadership of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Shapingba District Committee of the Communist Party of China, after careful study, established a school trade store in the district, equipped with more than 50 commercial personnel responsible for investigating and understanding the needs of teachers, students and staff. The school trade store in Shapingba District has taken active measures to comprehensively improve the commodity supply work of various schools. In five universities and colleges, including Chongqing University, Chongqing Medical College, and Chongqing Institute of Architecture and Engineering, grassroots retail stores have been established or expanded, and department stores for daily-use industrial products and cultural supplies, and non-staple food stores have been added. The business of general merchandise, cultural supplies, and knitwear has been expanded, and the variety of commodities has increased from more than 3,100 to more than 8,800. The department stores for general merchandise and cultural supplies are also equipped with 14 kinds of instruments and hole punchers, paper cutters, etc. for students to rent. Among the general merchandise, they have especially increased the supply of towels, handkerchiefs, socks, and cloth shoes that are relatively cheap and have simple and beautiful styles; if teachers and students need certain special commodities, the store can also purchase them on their behalf. School grassroots stores have also set up 20 life service stations in student dormitories and family areas, entrusting active members of the family to sell miscellaneous daily necessities, so that teachers, students, and their families can purchase them nearby.

Most of the students in these schools are boarding students, and many living utensils and clothes, shoes, and socks are damaged and need to be repaired. Originally, the service and repair industries in the school district were incomplete and lacked organization and guidance, far from meeting the requirements of teachers, students, and staff. The school trade store, on the one hand, strengthened the organization and guidance of the original service and repair industries and gave play to their potential; at the same time, it established a service department at Chongqing University, where there are more teachers and students. In addition to organizing a group of professional sewing and shoe repair workers to serve teachers and students, it is also equipped with sewing machines, hairdressing tools, razors, needles and threads, scrap cloth, shoe polish, etc., to organize students to serve themselves and each other. There are more than 60 service items in total. The district school trade store also helped the school canteens to renovate cooking utensils, develop non-staple food production, and improve the quality of food.

In organizing school economic life and improving supply work, the school trade store fully relied on the forces of school welfare departments, student unions, and family committees. The Party committees and administrative departments of various schools helped the store solve problems such as business locations, warehouses, and counters in many ways.

    文教区商业工作的好榜样
    重庆沙坪坝区商业部门对师生员工服务周到
    据新华社重庆电　重庆市学校集中的重点文化区——沙坪坝区的商业部门，根据为教学服务、方便群众的原则，全面安排学校的供应工作和组织师生员工的经济生活，使学校里的商品供应和服务工作大有改进，受到了教师和学生们的热烈赞扬。
    中共沙坪坝区委在中共重庆市委的统一领导下，经过认真研究后，在区内成立了学校贸易商店，配备五十多名商业人员负责调查了解师生员工的需要。沙坪坝区的学校贸易商店采取积极措施，全面改进了各个学校的商品供应工作。在重庆大学、重庆医学院、重庆建筑工程学院等五所大、专学校里，建立或扩大了基层零售商店，增设日用工业品、文化用品门市部、副食品门市部，扩大百货用品、文化用品、针织品的经营，商品的花色品种由原来的三千一百多个增加到八千八百多个。百货、文化用品门市部还备有十四种仪器和打洞机、裁纸刀等，供学生们租借使用。在百货用品中，特别增加了价格比较便宜、式样又大方美观的毛巾、手巾、袜子、布鞋；师生们需要某些特殊商品，商店也可以代购。学校基层商店还在学生宿舍、家属区设立了二十个生活服务站，委托家属中的积极分子代销零星日用品，使师生和家属能就近购买。
    这些学校的学生都是住校生，许多生活用具和衣服、鞋袜破了需要找人修补，原来在学校区的服务、修补行业不齐全，又缺乏组织指导，远不能满足师生员工的要求。学校贸易商店一方面加强对原有服务修补行业的组织指导工作，发挥他们的潜力；同时，在师生较多的重庆大学设立了一个服务部，除了组织一批专业的缝衣、补鞋工人为师生服务以外，还备有缝衣机、理发工具、刮胡刀、针线、零碎布、擦鞋油等，组织学生自我服务和相互服务，服务项目总共有六十多个。区学校贸易商店还帮助学校食堂革新炊具，发展副食品生产，改进伙食质量。
    在组织学校经济生活和改善供应工作中，学校贸易商店充分依靠了学校福利部门、学生会和家属委员会等各方面的力量。各学校的党委和行政部门从多方面帮助商店解决营业地点、仓库、货柜等方面的问题。
