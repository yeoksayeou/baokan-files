Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd dispatch from Moscow (TASS): On February 22nd, a grand gathering was held at the Central Theater of the Soviet Army in Moscow to celebrate the 42nd anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army.

    Soviet Defense Minister Marshal Malinovsky, in his speech at the meeting, emphasized that the main source of the Soviet Army and Navy's strength and invincibility lies in the fact that its organizers, leaders, and educators are the Communist Party.

    Malinovsky said that the celebration of the 42nd anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army is taking place amidst the brilliant achievements of the Soviet state in communist construction and the struggle for peace. He recounted that the recent decision by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to unilaterally reduce the Soviet armed forces by one-third (i.e., 1.2 million people) was a new peace initiative.

    Those attending the celebration included Soviet Marshals, Generals, officers, representatives of factories and enterprises, and figures from the scientific and cultural fields.

    In addition, grand celebrations were also held in the Soviet cities of Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, Alma-Ata, Baku, Tashkent, Frunze, Stalinabad, Vilnius, Riga, and Stalingrad to celebrate Soviet Army Day.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 23rd (TASS): Today, TASS reported: The order of the Soviet Minister of Defense, Marshal Malinovsky, congratulating the military on the 42nd anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army and Navy, has been published here.

    To celebrate this festival, Malinovsky ordered twenty artillery salvoes to be fired on February 23rd in Moscow and the capitals of the Union Republics, as well as in the hero cities of Leningrad, Stalingrad, Sevastopol, and Odessa.

    Malinovsky pointed out that the resolution of the Fourth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on another massive reduction of the Soviet armed forces is a major step aimed at easing international tensions. He pointed out that the reduction of the Soviet armed forces and defense expenditures will not cause damage to the Soviet Union's defense capabilities.

    The Soviet Defense Minister pointed out in his order that if the Soviet Union's previously proposed comprehensive and complete disarmament proposal is supported by all countries, then the Soviet Union is willing to fully implement this proposal. Malinovsky said that until this proposal is adopted, the Soviet Union will continue to strengthen its defense forces.

    In his order, the Soviet Defense Minister called on soldiers who are retired to the reserves and veterans to set an example of heroic labor in the national economy.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 23rd: Soviet Defense Minister, Marshal of the Soviet Union, Malinovsky published an article in "Pravda" today to celebrate Soviet Army Day.

    Malinovsky pointed out that the Soviet Army, from the first day of its establishment, has faithfully served the interests of the people, and it is a powerful fortress guaranteeing the independence and security of the Soviet people. He said that for forty-two years, the Soviet Army has vigilantly defended peace.

    Malinovsky said that the Soviet Union's renewed reduction of armed forces is a logical product of the Soviet Union's consistent and earnest implementation of a policy of peace. However, what cannot but arouse the indignation of honest people is that some people in Western countries harbor disgraceful attempts to distort the Soviet Union's measures in reducing armed forces. He recounted that some people in the West, including military personnel, insisted that the measures taken by the Soviet government do not mean disarmament, but rather signify the re-equipment of an army that seems to have aggressive desires. Malinovsky wrote that it does not take great wisdom to understand that a country that intends to invade another country cannot reduce its armed forces, because without them, it is unimaginable to attack others.

    The Soviet Marshal continued to write that it is understandable that vicious, militarily ignorant slanderers would utter this kind of clamor. But when those who are knowledgeable about military affairs or heads of military departments also utter this kind of slander, then a malicious intention is clearly exposed behind their fabrications: an attempt to distort the Soviet policy aimed at ensuring world peace.

    Malinovsky pointed out that the recent speech by U.S. Secretary of Defense Gates at a closed-door meeting of the Defense Subcommittee is one example of this kind of clamor. Malinovsky wrote that these figures are unwilling to abandon the "Cold War," and they are striving to use every possible means to obstruct the easing of international tensions.

    Malinovsky said that the Soviet Union does not intend to invade anyone, nor does it threaten anyone. If the Soviet government continues to consolidate its national defense on the basis of the latest technology, it is for no other reason than to ensure security, because there are still many imperialist forces in the world who are still openly advocating preparing to attack the Soviet Union and socialist countries. He said that the powerful rocket-nuclear weapons mastered by the Soviet Army consolidate and reliably guarantee the indestructible defense of the Soviet Union and socialist countries. The Soviet Army will vigilantly defend the Soviet Union's peaceful labor and world peace.

    Soviet Marshal Grechko, in an article published in "Red Star," said that the Soviet Army has achieved new and significant achievements in firepower, tactics, technology, and the physical and political literacy of the army, but we must never stop at the achievements we have already made; in modern conditions, stopping is particularly dangerous. We must not forget for a minute the provocations of imperialist reactionary and aggressive forces. There are still military bases around the Soviet Union and the socialist camp that imperialism uses for offensive purposes. The Soviet Army's primary responsibility is to fully enhance vigilance and tirelessly strengthen combat readiness.

    Soviet Navy Commander-in-Chief Gorshkov wrote in an article in "Soviet Navy News" that the Soviet Union's reduction in the number of troops does not mean weakening its combat readiness. As long as the danger of aggression exists, the Soviet Army must maintain the necessary level of defense. He said that it cannot be ignored that the aggressive groups of Western countries are still stubbornly opposed to easing international tensions, the United States is still conducting a nuclear arms race, and is still increasing appropriations for "military aid" to its allies in its military groups. West German militarism is seriously threatening peace, so even the slightest negligence of these facts can lead to very dangerous consequences.

    莫斯科盛会庆祝苏联建军节
    苏军将领揭露帝国主义加紧核武装准备进攻社会主义阵营
    强调苏军的首要职责是全力提高警惕不倦地加强战斗准备
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科22日讯：2月22日，在莫斯科苏军中央剧院举行了盛大集会，庆祝苏联军队建军四十二周年。
    苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基元帅在会上讲话时强调指出，苏联陆海军的力量和不可战胜的主要源泉，在于它的组织者、领导者和教育者是共产党。
    马利诺夫斯基说，庆祝苏军建军四十二周年是在苏维埃国家在共产主义建设和争取和平斗争中取得了辉煌成就的情况下进行的。他追述说，不久前苏联最高苏维埃作出的单方面裁减苏联武装部队三分之一（即一百二十万人）的决定，是一个新的和平倡议。
    出席这次庆祝会的有：苏联元帅、将军、军官，各工厂企业的代表和科学、文化界人士等。
    此外，苏联的列宁格勒、基辅、明斯克、阿拉木图、巴库、塔什干、伏龙芝、斯大林纳巴德、维尔纽斯、里加、斯大林格勒等城市也举行了盛大庆祝会，庆祝苏军建军节。
    新华社莫斯科23日电　塔斯社今天报道：这里发表了苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基元帅的命令，他在命令中向军人祝贺苏联陆海军四十二周年建军节。
    为了庆祝这一节日，马利诺夫斯基命令2月23日在莫斯科和各加盟共和国首都，以及英雄城市——列宁格勒、斯大林格勒、塞瓦斯托波尔和敖德萨鸣放礼炮二十响。
    马利诺夫斯基指出，苏联最高苏维埃第四次会议关于再一次大量裁减苏联武装部队的决议是目的在于缓和国际紧张局势的重大步骤。他指出，裁减苏联武装部队和国防费用不会给苏联的防御能力造成损失。
    苏联国防部长在命令中指出，如果苏联以前提出的全面彻底裁军的建议得到所有国家的支持，那么苏联愿意完全实现这一建议。马利诺夫斯基说，但是在这项建议未被采纳前，苏联仍将加强国防力量。
    苏联国防部长在命令中号召退为预备役和退职的军人在国家的国民经济中做英雄劳动的典范。
    新华社莫斯科23日电　苏联国防部长、苏联元帅马利诺夫斯基今天在“真理报”上发表文章，庆祝苏联建军节。
    马利诺夫斯基指出，苏联军队从它建立的第一天起便忠实地服务于人民的利益，它是保障苏联人民的独立和安全的强大堡垒。他说，四十二年来，苏联军队警惕地捍卫着和平。
    马利诺夫斯基说，苏联再次裁减武装部队，这是苏联一贯认真执行和平政策的合乎逻辑的产物。但是，不能不引起正直人士的愤慨的是，西方国家某些人士竟抱有歪曲苏联在裁减武装部队方面的措施的不光彩的企图。他追述说，西方某些人士、其中包括军人硬说，苏联政府所采取的措施并不意味着裁军，而是标志着似乎带有侵略欲望的军队的更新装备。马利诺夫斯基写道，毋需有很大的智慧就能明白，一个蓄意侵犯别国的国家不可能裁减自己的武装部队，因为没有了它们要进攻别人是不可想像的。
    苏联元帅继续写道，凶恶的、在军事方面无知的诽谤者发出这一类的叫嚣还是可以理解的。但是，当那些对军事内行的人或军事部门的负责人也发出这种诬蔑的时候，那末，在他们的谰言背后便明显地暴露出一种恶毒的意图：企图歪曲旨在确保世界和平的苏联政策。
    马利诺夫斯基指出，美国国防部长盖茨不久前在国防小组委员会的一次秘密会议上的讲话便是这种叫嚣的例证之一。马利诺夫斯基写道，这些人物不愿意放弃“冷战”，他们正在竭力利用一切可能来阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和。
    马利诺夫斯基说，苏联不打算侵犯任何人，也不威胁任何人。如果说苏联政府在最新的技术的基础上继续巩固自己的国防，这不是为了别的，只是为了保证安全，因为，世界上还存在着不少帝国主义势力，他们还在公开地主张准备进攻苏联和社会主义各国。他说，苏联军队所掌握的强大的火箭—核武器巩固地、可靠地保证着苏联和社会主义各国不可摧毁的国防。苏联军队将警惕地保卫苏联的和平劳动和世界和平。
    苏联元帅格列奇科在“红星报”上发表文章说，苏联军队在火力、战术、技术和军队的体力上和政治素养上都获得了新的重大的成绩，但是，决不能停留在已有的成绩上，在现代条件下停步不前是特别危险的。我们一分钟都不能忘记帝国主义反动势力和侵略势力的挑衅，在苏联和社会主义阵营周围仍然存在着帝国主义用来进攻的军事基地，苏联军队的首要职责就是全力提高警惕性，不倦地加强战斗准备。
    苏联海军总司令戈尔什科夫在“苏联海军报”上写文章说，苏联裁减军队人数决不是减弱自己的战斗准备，只要侵略的危险性存在，苏联军队就要保持必需的国防水平。他说，不能不估计到西方国家的侵略集团还在顽固地反对缓和国际紧张局势，美国还在进行核武装竞赛，还在对它的军事集团的同盟者增加“军事援助”的拨款，英国的军事预算已达到了最近几年来创纪录的水平。西德军国主义正在严重地威胁和平，因此，对这些事实的最小的疏忽也会导致十分危险的后果。
