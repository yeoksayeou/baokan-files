    To study Mao Zedong Thought, we must have the correct method. In the leap forward of theoretical work in the past two years, many good methods have been created in the study of both cadres and workers and peasants. Of course, the specific learning methods are diverse and vary from person to person, place to place, and time to time, and it is impossible to have a one-size-fits-all approach. However, there is a common and fundamental learning method, that is, the method of combining theory and practice, which all of us must adhere to and implement.
    The unity of theory and practice is a basic principle of Marxism-Leninism, and it is also the guiding principle and fundamental method for us to study theory. Comrade Mao Zedong once elevated the issue of the unity of theory and practice to the level of attitude towards Marxism-Leninism and to the level of Party spirit. Because our theory is not a dogma, but comes from practice and is for practice; the purpose of our studying theory is not to study theory for the sake of studying theory, but to go to the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin to find the stand, viewpoint, and method for solving the practical and theoretical problems of the Chinese revolution and construction. Similarly, our practice is not blind practice, but conscious practice guided by revolutionary theory. Therefore, theory and practice must be combined; theory that is not connected with practice and practice that is not guided by theory will not be correct. The same is true for studying Mao Zedong Thought. Today, studying Mao Zedong Thought requires close integration with the party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, the people's communes, and other actual struggles. At the same time, we must also emphasize reading Comrade Mao Zedong's works carefully and systematically improving our theoretical level. Neither should be neglected. To study Mao Zedong Thought, we must establish this method of combining theory and practice, so as to prevent the deviations of dogmatism and empiricism.
    The reason why dogmatism and empiricism are wrong is that they mechanically separate theory and practice, learning and doing. We have always advocated that learning and doing should be unified and closely combined, learning while doing, and learning for application. Because without practice, we cannot truly understand Marxism-Leninism; and whether we have truly understood Marxism-Leninism depends on whether we can apply it to practice, that is, to understanding problems, transforming thoughts, and guiding struggles. To do is to understand, and to be able to do is to understand, that is the reason. Therefore, from practice to theory and then to practice should be regarded as a unified and complete process of learning. Of course, our emphasis on practice in this way does not mean that we should not read carefully and be proficient in theory. The question is how to be proficient. Some people say: "Be proficient first and then apply," "Be proficient first and then connect." This regards proficiency in theory as an isolated and static matter, thinking that one can be proficient in theory without practice, or that one can be proficient in theory simply by reading the books thoroughly. This is obviously wrong. Some people also believe that the combination of theory and practice can only be "learn what you do." This view is also one-sided. If we should closely combine our actual work and actual struggles for learning, or that we should learn what we do, and that we should learn seriously from work and struggle, then of course this is completely correct. However, if it is believed that since theory and practice are combined, the content of our learning should be limited to the scope of our own (a region, a department, a person's) daily work, and there is no need to learn as much theory and knowledge as possible from a wider range of practices, or that one can only learn from one's own narrow practice, thinking that practice is theory, and there is no need to elevate practice to theory and systematically learn theory, then this is not correct. Because the more comprehensive our cadres' knowledge is and the higher their theoretical level is, the better they will do their work. The rapid development of socialist construction in the future will require us to systematically study theory and master Mao Zedong Thought; only in this way can we keep up with the needs of the situation.
    There are mainly the following methods for combining theory and practice: One is to focus on the practical problems in current work, and combine learning theory with summarizing experience, improving thinking, and improving work, "twisting them into one rope." This is a lively and vigorous learning method that closely combines theory and practice. The first phase of the study class for county party secretaries and above held by the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, and the theoretical study of workers and peasants in various places, all adopted this method. It has played a very good role in improving the cognitive level of cadres and the masses and promoting current production and work. One is through the method of rectification movement. It closely combines learning theory with transforming thinking, focusing on major ideological issues of universal significance that urgently need to be resolved, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and improving the awareness of party members and cadres through learning, debate, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and gradually overcoming various erroneous non-proletarian ideologies and worldviews and their influences. Experience has proved that carrying out a rectification study after a certain period of time is an important method for rapidly improving the level of Mao Zedong Thought of party members and cadres. Another method is to read Comrade Mao Zedong's works in a certain logical order and combine it closely with reality to carry out theoretical study more systematically. This is also an effective learning method that we often use. Some people mistakenly believe that taking this method of learning is "starting from books" and is a learning method that is divorced from reality. In fact, learning according to the logical system of works or theoretical courses is two different things from "starting from books." The so-called "starting from books" refers to regarding books as dogma and randomly applying them to everything; in terms of learning methods, regardless of the actual needs and possibilities, rigidly adhering to the textbook and learning from the first chapter to the last in a uniform way, and neither connecting the things in the books with reality to understand them, nor using them to solve practical problems. This kind of learning attitude and method that is divorced from reality should of course be opposed. However, we cannot deny the necessity of systematically studying theory and learning Comrade Mao Zedong's works because of this. Of course, no matter which method of learning is adopted, we must adhere to the principle of close combination of theory and practice.

### 坚持理论和实践相结合的学习方法

    坚持理论和实践相结合的学习方法
    学习毛泽东思想，必须有正确的方法。这两年理论工作的跃进中，不论干部的学习或工农群众的学习，都创造了许多好的方法。当然，具体的学习方法是多种多样的，因人因地因时有所不同，不可能千篇一律。但是有一个共同的根本的学习方法，即理论和实践相结合的方法，则是我们所有的人都必须坚持实行的。
    理论和实践的统一，是马克思列宁主义的基本原则，也是我们学习理论的指导方针和根本方法。毛泽东同志曾经把理论和实践的统一问题，提高到对待马克思列宁主义的态度问题来看待，提高到党性的问题来看待。因为我们的理论不是教条，而是来自实践又为了实践的；我们学习理论的目的，不是为学理论而学理论，而是为了要解决中国革命和建设的实际问题和理论问题而到马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作那里找立场、观点、方法的。同样，我们的实践不是盲目的实践，而是有革命理论指导的自觉的实践。因此，理论和实践必须结合起来；不与实践联系的理论，和不受理论指导的实践，都不会是正确的。学习毛泽东思想也是如此。在今天来说，学习毛泽东思想，就要和党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社等实际斗争密切结合起来，同时也要强调认真阅读毛泽东同志的著作，系统地提高理论水平，两者不可偏废。学习毛泽东思想，必须确立这个理论和实践相结合的方法，从而防止教条主义和经验主义的偏向。
    教条主义和经验主义所以是错误的，就在于它把理论和实践、学和做机械地分割开来。我们从来主张学和做应当统一，应当密切结合，边做边学，边学边用。因为离开了实践，我们就不可能真正学懂马克思列宁主义；而是不是真正学懂了马克思列宁主义，这又要看是不是能够把它应用于实践，即应用于认识问题、改造思想、指导斗争。要做才会懂，能做才算懂，就是这个道理。因此，从实践到理论再到实践，应当看作是学习的统一的全过程。当然，我们这样强调实践，丝毫也不意味着不要认真读书，精通理论。问题是在于如何精通。有人说：“先精通而后应用”，“先精通而后联系”。这是把精通理论看作孤立的静止的事情，以为离开实践也可以精通理论，或者只要把书本读熟就算是精通理论。这显然是错误的。也有的人认为，理论和实践相结合，就只能“做什么，学什么”。这种看法也有片面性。如果说，我们应当密切结合我们的实际工作实际斗争来进行学习，或者说，我们做什么就应当学什么，我们应当从工作中、从斗争中认真学习，这当然是完全正确的。但是，如果认为既然是理论和实践相结合，我们学习的内容就只能限于自己（一个地区、一个部门、一个人）的日常工作的范围，而不需要从更广泛的实践范围中，学习尽可能多的理论和知识，或者只能从自己狭窄的实践中学习，认为实践就是理论，而不需要把实践提升为理论，和系统地学习理论，这就是不正确的。因为我们干部的知识愈全面，理论水平愈高，才会把工作做得愈好。今后社会主义建设事业的迅速发展，更加要求我们系统地学习理论，掌握毛泽东思想；只有这样，才能跟上形势的需要。
    理论和实践相结合，主要的有以下几种方法：一种是以当前工作中的实际问题为中心，把学习理论和总结经验、提高思想、改进工作结合起来，“拧成一股绳”。这是一种生动活泼的、理论和实践紧密结合的学习方法。广东省委举办的县委书记以上干部学习班的第一期，和各地的工农学理论，都是采取这种办法。它对于提高干部和群众的认识水平，推动当前的生产和工作，都起到很好的作用。一种是通过整风运动的方法。它把学习理论和改造思想密切地结合起来，以当前迫切需要解决的带普遍性的重大思想问题为中心，运用毛泽东思想作武器，通过学习、辩论，开展批评和自我批评，提高党员和干部的觉悟，逐步克服各种错误的非无产阶级的意识形态和世界观及其影响。经验证明，经过一定时期进行一次整风学习，是迅速提高党员和干部的毛泽东思想水平的重要方法。还有一种方法是按某种逻辑顺序阅读毛泽东同志的著作，密切结合实际，比较系统地进行理论学习。这也是我们经常采用的有效的学习方法。有的人误认为采取这种方法学习，就是“从书本出发”，是脱离实际的学习方法。其实，按照著作或理论课程的逻辑系统来学习，这和“从书本出发”，是不同的两回事情。所谓“从书本出发”，是指把书本奉为教条，往一切事物上乱套；在学习方法上不顾实际的需要和可能，千篇一律地硬要按照教科书从第一章依次学到最后一章，对书本上的东西，既不联系实际去了解，也不运用来解决实际问题。这种脱离实际的学习态度和方法，当然是要反对的。但是不能因此就否认系统地学习理论，学习毛泽东同志著作的必要性。当然，不论采取哪一种方法学习，都必须坚持理论和实际密切结合的原则。
