Red azolla is a type of surface fertilizer that floats in paddy fields and shallow ditches. Its growth period is short, and its reproductive capacity is strong. It can reproduce five to fourteen generations in twenty-five to thirty days. It has high yield, is easy to manage, and simple to use.

Red azolla has a high fertilizer efficiency. People in Changle County, Fujian Province, believe that twenty to thirty dan of red azolla can replace ten to twenty dan of human manure, equivalent to forty to fifty jin of soybean cake. Scientific analysis shows that red azolla (air-dried) contains 2.76% nitrogen, 0.35% phosphoric acid, 1.18% potassium oxide, 3% water-soluble mineral components, 0.7% ash, and about 0.7% of difficult-to-decompose cellulose. Red azolla is a good organic fertilizer for rice. Applying red azolla can generally increase production by about 10% to 20%. At the same time, it can improve the soil, increase the organic matter in the soil, and make the soil loose; it can also store fertilizer, retain fertilizer, inhibit weed growth, and regulate soil temperature, conserve water, and prevent drought.

Red azolla is a temperature-loving aquatic plant. The suitable growth temperature is between 12 and 18 degrees Celsius. "Start of Spring" to "Start of Summer" is the most suitable period for cultivating red azolla, and seedlings are generally introduced before "Start of Spring". There are many benefits to raising azolla in paddy fields. It can not only supply the nutrients needed for the growth and development of early rice and increase the yield of early rice, but also leave some nutrients for late rice, promoting the increase in late rice production.

    红萍
    红萍是一种水面肥，浮生于水田、浅水沟塘。它的生长期短，繁殖力强，二十五天到三十天即可繁殖五代到十四代，产量高，管理方便，使用简单。
    红萍肥效较高。福建长乐县群众认为二十担到三十担红萍可抵十担到二十担人粪尿，相当于四十斤到五十斤豆饼。科学化验分析，红萍（风干）含氮百分之二点七六、磷酸百分之零点三五、氧化钾百分之一点一八、水溶性矿质成分百分之三、灰分百分之零点七和不易分解的纤维素百分之零点七左右。红萍是水稻的一种优良的有机肥料，施用红萍，一般可增产一成至两成左右。同时，它可以改良土壤，增加土壤中有机质，使土壤疏松；又可以起蓄肥保肥，抑制杂草生长和调节土温、保水防旱等作用。
    红萍是一种喜温的水生植物。适合它的生长温度是摄氏十二度到十八度之间。“立春”到“立夏”是养殖红萍最适宜的时期，一般都在“立春”前引种。稻田养萍好处很多，不仅可供给早稻生长发育所需要的养分，提高早稻产量，同时有部分养分可以遗留给晚稻，促进晚稻增产。
