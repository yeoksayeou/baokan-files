Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, February 17th: Yunnan Province's steelmaking workers, with a spirit of continuous revolution, vigorously engaged in technical innovation, pushing the production of small and medium-sized blast furnaces to new heights. In January, the province's small and medium-sized blast furnaces used an average of only 965 kilograms of coke per ton of iron produced, a 15.4% reduction compared to the fourth quarter of last year, making it the province with the lowest coke ratio for ironmaking in the country. The average utilization coefficient of the province's blast furnaces increased by 13.8% in January compared to the fourth quarter of last year, reaching 1.238. Other technical and economic indicators also maintained the advanced level in the country.

    The vast majority of the small and medium-sized blast furnaces currently operating in Yunnan were built during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. After a year of consolidation and improvement last year, the average utilization coefficient of the province's blast furnaces in December increased nearly twofold compared to January, and the coke ratio decreased by about 30%. The qualification rate of pig iron reached 94.4%. Since September of last year, the cost of pig iron from small blast furnaces has consistently been lower than the national target, making them a red flag among the small-scale, indigenous ironmaking groups nationwide.

    After entering 1960, under the leadership of the Party organizations, the employees of Yunnan's iron and steel enterprises launched a technical innovation movement targeting the three key factors that most affected production: raw materials, wind temperature, and operations. Workers at the Fuyuan Mine overcame difficulties such as the lack of machine tools and technical personnel, and self-reliantly manufactured a set of sintering equipment, vigorously promoting sintered ore. They also manufactured spiral ore washing machines and ore screening machines to wash and screen the ore, improving its grade and ensuring uniform particle size. Workers at the No. 2 blast furnace of the Kunming Iron and Steel Company's ironmaking plant overcame the past mentality of waiting for foreign equipment. They vigorously promoted semi-mechanization after the furnace, quickly repairing the earthen material warehouse, crusher, screening machine, and belt conveyor. This transformed the entire set of post-furnace operations, such as crushing, screening, and transporting ore, which had previously been entirely manual, into mechanical operations, increasing the material feed per shift from 45 batches to 60 batches. Iron and steel workers in various regions also adopted methods such as feeding the blast furnaces with sintered ore and graded charging to generally increase the grade of the raw ore to about 50%.

    Increasing the air volume and raising the wind temperature was the second aspect of technical innovation in various blast furnaces. The air in the Yunnan plateau is relatively thin, and the air volume of the same blower is less when used in Yunnan than in other regions. This resulted in many blast furnaces having low air volume and low temperature, affecting the increase in production. The ironmaking workers put forward the slogan "One pound of wind, one pound of iron," and tried every possible means to find ways to improve the "wind" factor. The workers on the small blast furnace of the Kunming No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant doubled the charging speed of the blast furnace after enlarging the diameter of the air inlet. The workers on the small blast furnace of the Xinjian Iron Plant connected the blowers in parallel and in series, and adopted multi-nozzle combustion to increase the wind temperature of the blast furnace by about one time, thereby increasing the utilization coefficient by one time.

    Improving operations and ensuring smooth furnace operation was the third aspect of technical innovation in Yunnan's small and medium-sized blast furnaces. In terms of operation, the workers of each blast furnace have achieved diligence in observation, analysis, and inspection, and strengthened the maintenance and repair of power equipment. The workers of each blast furnace of Kunming Iron and Steel Company implemented unified operation in three shifts, and through vigorously carrying out technical performance competitions, quickly mastered advanced operating techniques for all workers in the plant. The post-furnace workers of the Fuyuan Mine created dozens of charging systems. After repeated trials and comparisons, they found the best charging system, which made the raw materials evenly distributed and easy to melt after entering the furnace, greatly reducing the consumption of coke and increasing the utilization coefficient.

    钢铁战线奋夺高产优质
    云南中小高炉全面跃进　成本焦比一再降低
    新华社昆明17日电　云南省炼铁职工用不断革命的精神大搞技术革新，把中小高炉生产推上了新的高峰。1月份，全省中、小高炉平均每生产一吨铁只用九百六十五公斤焦炭，比去年第四季度降低15．4％，是全国炼铁用焦比例最低的省份。全省高炉的平均利用系数，1月份比去年第四季度提高了13．8％，达到一点二三八。其它技术经济指标，也保持了全国先进水平。
    云南现在开炉的中小高炉绝大部分是在1958年大跃进中建设起来的。经过去年一年的巩固提高，去年12月全省高炉的平均利用系数比1月份提高了将近一倍，焦比则降低了30％左右，生铁合格率达到94．4％；从去年9月份起，小高炉生铁成本一直低于国家规定的指标，成为全国炼铁小洋群中的一面红旗。
    跨进1960年以后，云南各炼铁企业职工在党组织的领导下，针对影响生产最大的原料、风温和操作三大关键，展开了技术革新运动。富源矿厂职工克服了没有机床和技术力量不足等困难，自力更生制造出一套烧结设备，大搞烧结矿，并且制造了螺旋洗矿机和筛矿机，对矿石进行洗选和筛分，提高了矿石的品位，保证了矿石的粒度均匀。昆明钢铁公司炼铁厂二号高炉职工克服了过去等待洋设备的思想，在炉后大搞半机械化，很快修好了土料仓、破碎机、筛分机和皮带运输机，使以往完全是手工操作的碎矿、筛矿和运矿等一整套炉后操作，都改为机械操作，每班上料由四十五批增加到六十批。各地炼铁职工还采取让高炉吃熟料和分级入炉等办法，使原矿品位一般提高到50％左右。
    加大风量提高风温，是各高炉技术革新的第二个方面，云南高原的空气比较稀薄，同样的鼓风机，在云南使用时风量要比其他地区少，因此造成许多高炉风量小、温度低，影响了生产的提高。炼铁工人们提出了“一斤风、一斤铁”的口号，千方百计在“风”字上想办法。昆明第一钢铁厂小高炉上的职工，把进风口的直径扩大后，高炉的下料速度比过去加快了一倍。新建铁厂小高炉上的职工，把鼓风机并联和串联起来，采用多嘴燃烧，把高炉的风温提高一倍左右，从而使利用系数增大了一倍。
    改进操作，保证炉子顺行，是云南中小高炉技术革新的第三个方面。各高炉职工在操作方面，都作到了勤观察，勤分析，勤检查，并且加强了对动力设备的维护检修工作。昆明钢铁公司各高炉职工实行了三班统一操作，并且通过大搞技术表演赛，使先进操作技术很快为全厂职工所掌握。富源矿厂的炉后工人创造了几十种装料制度，经过反复试验比较，找出了一种最好的装料制度，使原料入炉后分布均匀，易于熔化，大大降低了焦炭的消耗量，提高了利用系数。
