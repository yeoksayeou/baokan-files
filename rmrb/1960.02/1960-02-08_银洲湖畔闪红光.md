Party Secretary's Notes

    Red Light Flashes on the Shores of Yinzhou Lake
    Zhang Peikun, First Secretary of the Communist Party of China, Huan Cheng People's Commune Committee, Xinhui, Guangdong

    Huan Cheng People's Commune is a paradise, fish and shrimp fill the sea, grain fills the granary, pigs, cattle, chickens and ducks are everywhere in the fields, vehicles and ships and machinery replace human labor,
    Sunflower green, orange yellow, flowers and fruits flourish, mountains and rivers are beautiful, the scenery is good, the people are diligent and create much, happy life lasts ten thousand years.

    This folk song expresses the ideals of the members of the Huan Cheng People's Commune and also depicts the new look of the commune. The Huan Cheng People's Commune is located around the county seat of Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, backing against Guifeng Mountain and facing Yinzhou Lake. The mountains and rivers are charming, the land is fertile, fish and rice are abundant, and products are rich. The red light of the rising sun of the People's Commune caresses everything here, making it even more lovely. Look, the land is flat, and the tractor turns up the boundless black waves; the ditches are crisscrossed, and the lush lychee and banana trees on the embankments surround the area like a screen; the sunflower groves are like the sea, and the sugar cane becomes forests; the golden oranges and green vegetables and wheat; fishing boats and small boats move in the big lake; rows of factories and new houses stand in the suburbs. Crowds of people are everywhere in the fields. People are sending fertilizer into the fields and smoking the hard clay into loose black soil. The torrent of construction is surging everywhere, and the vigorous vitality is overflowing everywhere.

    Listen, that sound like spring thunder is the sound of blasting rocks at the Jinniutou Bridge sluice gate construction site. Looking along with the sound, you will see a magnificent picture of conquering mountains and rivers: the mountain head as high as ten ren (丈) has been cut off by half; a large dam stretches horizontally on the 120-meter-wide river surface, like a long sword, cutting off the turbulent tributary of the West River; on the site of the flattened mountain head, a 40-meter-long large bridge sluice gate has been built, allowing the water to enter and exit Yinzhou Lake regularly in the sluice hole. This bridge sluice gate is like a golden lock, locking the "Golden Bull" in the river, bringing four benefits of irrigation, transportation, power generation, and fish farming, eliminating the flood inundation and seawater salinity for more than 30,000 mu of paddy fields and orchards. The bridge surface of the middle sluice gate can be used for cars and pedestrians; a waiting room is set up under the bridge, which can allow 70-ton large ships to pass without affecting the water level difference. Three water turbines with a total of 180 horsepower will also be installed here, which can generate 130 kilowatts of electricity. The commune will establish an agricultural product processing plant here and provide electricity for lighting to more than 3,600 commune members nearby; a 70-meter-long movable net gate will also be built to turn more than 2,000 mu of rivers into large fish ponds.

    In the past, it was said that "the Golden Bull plugs the sea mouth, and the fiery horse turns its head back," but that was just a false story. The flood like a wild horse still surged forward over the Jinniutou, breaking through the embankments and submerging fields and villages. In the flood of 1947, more than 30,000 mu of seedlings and more than 2,000 mu of oranges were submerged in the water, causing half the rice harvest and the fruit trees to die, and more than 1,000 households were flooded. After liberation, under the leadership and mobilization of the Party, a large embankment was built, and the flood could not arbitrarily harm anymore, but waterlogging was difficult to drain, and irrigation was unsuccessful, and rich harvests were still not obtained. In the past few years, people have always wanted to build a sluice gate at Jinniutou. However, in the past, agricultural cooperatives had few people and weak strength, and the land was scattered. People were afraid that the benefits would not be evenly distributed, and they were unwilling to contribute money and effort, and the sluice gate was never built.

    In August 1958, the People's Commune was established. More than 45,000 people became one family, and more than 75,000 mu of land were connected in one breath. The strength was enhanced, and the "localism" was eliminated. Everyone decided to build the bridge sluice gate. People poured into the construction site from all directions, and the rumbling sound of blasting rocks resounded throughout the wilderness. Stones were thrown into the river like small mountains. Later, the commune invested 120,000 yuan, the county transportation department invested 80,000 yuan, and a large number of materials were allocated, and the strength was more sufficient. However, to build a sluice gate in the river, there was a shortage of wood, cement, and steel bars, and technical problems were difficult to solve. What to do? People changed the original design and implemented the method of moving mountains and filling the sea, using 100,000 workers to pull the Golden Bull across the opposite bank and block the sea to change the flow. The sluice gate was built on the original moved mountain land, and stones were used for masonry, which resulted in the saving of 3,000 fir piles, 5,000 bags of cement, and 40 tons of steel bars, but the bridge sluice gate was very strong. When you look up at this magnificent bridge sluice gate, you may think that this huge project is the masterpiece of an old engineer! No, in the construction team, only three were construction workers, and the rest were all farmers who had just put down their hoes. They dared to think and dared to do, were willing to learn and were willing to do. They used indigenous methods and poor methods. All the difficulties were solved one by one, and unimaginable miracles appeared one by one.

    Miracles also appear in commune-run industries. Before the communalization, according to the common saying, there were only "three Laos (佬)" here - barbers, tailors, and tinsmiths. To repair a hoe, you had to go to the city. But now, in just one year and four months, large and small factories such as machinery, agricultural tools, bricks and tiles, shipbuilding, papermaking, fertilizers, pesticides, grain processing, and non-staple food processing have developed to 62, and the number of employees has increased to more than 500. More complex machines such as lathes, planers, drilling machines, screw beds, rope making machines, bamboo breaking machines, rice noodle cutting machines, and noodle pressing machines can be manufactured in large quantities. Now there is the sound of motors everywhere. On the road and on the river, the vehicles and ships manufactured by the commune are running; most of the products on the shelves of the supply and marketing cooperative are products manufactured by the commune. This year, the factory buildings will continue to be expanded and production will be developed.

    How did commune-run industries develop? Take the papermaking factory as an example. This was the only so-called factory before communalization, operated by an agricultural cooperative. The factory site was originally a house for loading ash. Due to poor equipment, few manpower, low technology, and shortage of raw materials, seven people only produced more than 20 catties of rice straw paper a day, with an annual output value of more than 1,100 yuan, losing money every month and shutting down from time to time. After communalization, more than 30 young people were transferred to expand the factory. The production tasks were assigned, but the commune could only invest 24,000 yuan, which was not enough to buy a papermaking machine. Despite the difficulties, they did not complain, nor did they reach out to ask for a solution - the commune was newly established, and the family was still poor! They showed the true colors of revolutionaries, insisting on production while sending people to the mountains to cut trees and to the sea to take sand, building their own factory buildings. If they couldn't afford a papermaking machine, they imitated it with wood, and it only cost 1,500 yuan to make one; if they couldn't afford a pulping machine, they also imitated two with wood, costing only more than 200 yuan. If there was no cement, they used lime; if there were no steel pipes, they used tile pipes. If they didn't understand the technology, they sent people to other places to study. It was in this way that they started from scratch, from small to large, starting from scratch, constantly innovating, mechanizing all operations, improving production efficiency, and improving product quality. In the past, one person stepped on 50 catties of pulp a day, but now one person uses a machine to make 1,200 catties of pulp a day. In the past, only straw paper was produced, but now card paper, glossy paper, and wrapping paper can be produced, with a daily output value of more than 1,200 yuan, which is more than the output value of the past year. In 1960, it is also planned to expand the production of colored paper and newsprint, and the annual output value is planned to reach 1.05 million yuan. With the General Line and the People's Commune, people's enthusiasm and wisdom are really like adding wings to a tiger!

    With the People's Commune, many beautiful long-cherished wishes have become a reality. Since 1953, people have been looking forward to "electric lights and telephones, upstairs and downstairs." Now telephones have long been connected to all villages, electric lights will also be generally installed this year, and housing is also under construction. Go to Daduhui Brigade and take a look. Buildings are under construction, including bungalows and buildings; there are libraries, clubs, and auditoriums... Commune members heard about the construction of a new socialist village and reported the good news to each other. Li Haibo, a 70-year-old commune member, had been ill for many days. After recovering from his illness, he went out for a walk. A large row of new houses stood before him. He was so happy that his eyes sparkled with tears. He said to everyone, "Hey, it's changed! One generation looks forward to the next. Only the Communist Party can say it and do it."

    On the shores of Yinzhou Lake, the red light is shining. The happiness brought to people by communalization is really endless and cannot be fully written!

    银洲湖畔闪红光
    中共广东新会环城人民公社委员会第一书记　张培坤
    环城公社胜天堂，鱼虾满海粮满仓，猪牛鸡鸭遍田庄，车船机械代人忙，
    葵绿橙黄花果茂，山川秀丽好风光，人民勤劳多创造，幸福生活万年长。
    这首民歌，道出了环城人民公社社员的理想，也描绘出了公社的新貌。环城人民公社在广东省新会县城的周围，背倚圭峰山，面临银洲湖，山川妩媚，土地肥美，鱼米丰盛，物产富饶。人民公社这一轮旭日的红光抚照着这里的一切，使这里更加可爱了。看，土地平整，拖拉机翻起无边的黑浪；水沟纵横，围堤上茂绿的荔枝和香蕉，像围屏一样环绕着；葵林如海，甘蔗成林；黄澄澄的柑橙果子，绿油油的蔬菜、小麦；大湖里游动着渔船和小艇；郊野矗立着一排排的工厂，新房。田间人群如织。人们一面把肥料送入田中，一面把坚硬的粘土熏成浮松的黑土。到处奔腾着建设的巨流，到处洋溢着蓬勃的生机。
    听，那像春雷一样的声响，那是金牛头大桥闸工地的爆石声。随着这响声望去，就会看到一幅征服山河的壮丽的图景：高达十仞的山头，被削去半边；一条大坝横伸在一百二十米宽的河面，像一柄长剑，把汹涌的西江支流斩断；在被削平了的山头的基址上，筑起了四十米长的大桥闸，让流水在闸孔内规矩地进出银洲湖。这座桥闸就像一把金锁，把“金牛”锁在河中，带来灌溉、交通、发电、养鱼四利，使三万多亩稻田和果园，消除了洪水的淹浸和海水的咸害。中间大闸的桥面，能走动汽车和行人；桥下设有候船室，能通行七十吨大船而不影响水位逆差。这里还将安装三个水轮机，共一百八十马力，能发电一百三十瓩。公社将在这里建立农产品加工厂，并且供电给附近三千六百多户社员照明；还将建设一道七十米长的活动网闸，把二千多亩河流变为大鱼仓。
    过去传说“金牛塞海口，烈马转回头”，那只是虚妄的故事。像野马般的洪水，还是越过金牛头向前汹涌奔流，冲破堤岸，淹没田园和村庄。1947年那次洪水，就把三万多亩禾苗和二千多亩柑桔淹在水里，使水稻半收，果树死光，使一千多户人家水浸大床。解放后，在党的领导和发动下，修筑了大围堤，洪水不能任性为害了，但是渍水难排，灌溉失利，仍然得不到丰富的收获。几年来，人们总想在金牛头建个水闸。可是，过去农业社人少力薄，土地分散，人们又怕受益不均，不愿出钱出力，水闸始终没有兴修。
    1958年8月，人民公社成立了，四万五千多人合成一家，七万五千多亩土地连成一气，力量增强了，“本位”打消了，大家决意修筑桥闸。人们从四面八方涌来工地，隆隆的爆石声响彻旷野，石块像小山般抛入河中。以后又得到公社投资十二万元，县交通部门投资八万元，还拨来了大批材料，力量更加充足了。但是要在河中建闸，木材、水泥、钢筋都欠缺很多，技术问题也难解决。怎么办呢？人们改变了原来的设计，实行移山填海的办法，用了十万工，把金牛牵过对岸，堵海改流。又在原来移去的山地建闸，并且利用石块砌筑，结果节约了杉桩三千条、水泥五千包和钢筋四十吨，桥闸却非常坚固。当你举目眺望这座雄伟的桥闸时，也许以为这浩大的工程是老工程师的精心杰作吧！不，在施工队伍中，只有三个是建筑工人出身，其余尽是刚刚放下锄头的农民。他们敢想敢干，肯学肯做，用土办法、穷办法，所有的困难都一个又一个地解决了，不可想像的奇迹都一个又一个地出现了。
    奇迹还出现在社办工业方面。公社化前，按俗话说，这里只有“三佬”——剪发佬、车衣佬和焊锡佬。要修理锄头，也得到城里去。可是现在，不过一年又四个月，机械、农具、砖瓦、造船、造纸、化肥、农药、粮食加工、副食品加工等等大小工厂已发展到六十二间，职工增加到五百多人，车床、刨床、钻床、螺丝床、打绳机、破竹机、切粉机、压面机等较复杂的机械，都能大量制造了。现在到处都有马达的响声。路上河上，行的是公社制造的车船；供销社的货架上，多半是公社制造的产品。今年还将继续扩建厂房，发展生产。
    社办工业是怎样发展起来的呢？拿造纸厂来说吧。这是公社化前唯一的所谓工厂，由一个农业社经营，厂址原来是一间装灰的房子。由于设备差、人力少、技术低、原料缺，七个人一天只生产稻草纸二十多斤，年产总值一千一百多元，月月亏本，时时停工。公社化后，调派三十多个青年来扩建这个厂。生产任务派下来了，但是公社只能投资二万四千元，还不够买一部制纸机。困难重重，他们并没有埋怨，也没有伸手要求解决——公社初建，家底还薄啊！他们拿出了革命者的本色，一面坚持生产，一面派人上山砍树，下海取沙，自己修建厂房。买不起制纸机就用木料仿制，只用了一千五百元就做成了；买不起打浆机，也用木料仿制了二部，只用了二百多元。没有水泥，就用石灰；没有钢管，就用瓦管。不懂技术，就派人到外地学习。就是这样从无到有，从小到大，白手兴家，不断革新，使全部操作实现了机械化，提高了生产效率，提高了产品质量。过去一人一天踩纸浆五十斤，现在一人一天用机器打纸浆一千二百斤。过去单产草纸，现在可以生产卡片纸、油光纸和包装纸，每天产值一千二百多元，比过去一年的产值还多。1960年还计划扩大生产彩色纸和白报纸，全年产值计划达到一百零五万元。有了总路线和人民公社，人们的干劲和智慧真是如虎添翼了！
    有了人民公社，许多美好的宿愿都变成现实了。从1953年开始，人们就盼望着“电灯电话，楼上楼下”，现在电话早已遍通各村，电灯也将在今年普遍安装，住房也正在建设。到都会大队去看一看吧。一幢幢的房子，正在兴建，有平房，有楼房；有图书馆，有俱乐部，有大礼堂……社员听说建设社会主义新村，互相报喜。七十多岁的社员李豪伯，生病多天，病后出门一游，一大列新房矗立眼前，他高兴得眼睛闪着泪花，到处对人说：“嗨，变样啦！一代盼一代，只有共产党讲得出做得到。”
    银洲湖畔，红光闪闪。公社化带给人们的幸福，真是说不完，写不尽！
