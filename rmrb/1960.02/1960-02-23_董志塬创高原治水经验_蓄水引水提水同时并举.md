(Our newspaper, Lanzhou, 22nd) The people of Dongzhi Yuan, the largest loess plateau in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, are transforming the arid face of the loess plateau by adopting a method of comprehensive water management that combines water storage, diversion, and lifting. They are digging through loess layers ranging from ten to dozens of meters deep to build interconnected well systems, simultaneously blocking gully flows and surface water runoff, and constructing a network of plateau reservoirs and large and small water storage ponds to lift and divert water to the plateau.

Dongzhi Yuan is located in Qingyang County, eastern Gansu Province, at an altitude of over 1,400 meters, with a total area of 2,300 square kilometers. The annual rainfall on the plateau is only about 500 millimeters. After rain, the rainwater carries fertile topsoil directly to the bottom of the gullies. Although there is water at the bottom of the gullies and underground, the plateau is very dry, and grain yields are very low. Since liberation, the Party has led the people in water conservancy construction. In particular, since the establishment of people's communes, the first secretary of the county party committee personally led the Houguanzhai people to build interconnected well systems deep in the loess layer to divert water to the plateau, setting an example for water conservancy construction on the plateau. Last winter, the communes on the plateau launched large-scale water conservancy projects, creating a rich and diverse set of experiences for water conservancy construction on the plateau.

The plateau underground water diversion method created by the people of Dongzhi Yuan mainly includes four types: (1) In areas with abundant water sources, large-scale wells are excavated, and dozens of additional wells are dug around the large well, connecting them to the large well. In this way, the water flow is collected together, forming an underground reservoir, and the water can be lifted and irrigated by installing high-lift water lifting machinery. This type of underground reservoir was first successfully trialed in the Xinmin Production Team, with a single reservoir producing more than 200,000 cubic meters of water annually. (2) Constructing interconnected well systems, diverting water out of the plateau through open channels and underground passages. For example, the Houguan Production Team of the Xifeng People's Commune, along the direction of underground water flow, dug a well every ten meters on average over a two-kilometer range, digging a total of two hundred wells. A four-li underground channel connected the two hundred wells, and then flowed through a nine-li open channel, finally allowing the underground water deep in the loess layer to flow out of the plateau, with an annual diversion volume of up to 720,000 cubic meters. (3) Universally digging wells and building water storage tanks near the edges of cultivated areas along the roadsides of all wheat and autumn fields, with one tank per well or multiple tanks per well. The water tanks are built on high ground in the farmland, with channels for inlet and gates for outlet, to achieve year-round water storage, centralized use, and gravity irrigation. (4) In areas with low-lying terrain and abundant water flow, excavating large-scale canals to divert underground water for large-scale storage and irrigation.

While vigorously excavating underground water, great efforts are also being made in gully water storage and lifting water to the plateau. Dams are built in large and small gullies from top to bottom, so that small streams enter ponds and large streams flow into reservoirs, realizing the "gully bottom, river terrace, reservoir and pond" transformation, completely blocking and storing gully water, rainwater, and self-flowing water. On this basis, on the one hand, mountain-encircling canals are opened to divert water to the mountains; on the other hand, pumping machines and waterwheels are installed to lift water to the plateau. In mountainous areas, dams are built across rivers, and mountain-encircling canals are opened. Ponds and reservoirs are scattered around the canals, connecting canals and reservoirs to achieve year-round water diversion and storage, and irrigating fields.

Currently, Dongzhi Yuan has built 7,000 plateau reservoirs and large and small water storage ponds, capable of storing 100 million cubic meters of water, and dug 150,000 wells, each with water; 50 projects for lifting and diverting gully water to the plateau; two open and underground river channels; and 20 interconnected well systems. In early January, the 90,000 newly built wells in Dongzhi Yuan and other areas of Qingyang County officially opened canals to release water, diverting more than 6 million cubic meters of underground water to the plateau in three days, plus carrying ice and collecting snow, irrigating more than 500,000 mu of land. The 24,900 water conservancy facilities distributed on the one million mu of cultivated land across the plateau have all begun to generate benefits. Currently, in conjunction with spring plowing preparations centered on water conservancy, small-scale water conservancy projects are continuing to be built, and wheat fields are being heavily irrigated, so as to ensure plowing and planting, and good cultivation and good planting, so that every mu of the plateau's one million mu of land will increase production and achieve bumper harvests.

    董志塬创高原治水经验
    蓄水引水提水同时并举
    本报兰州22日电　黄河中游最大的一块黄土高原——董志塬上的人民，根据蓄、引、提并举，大兴水利的方法，凿穿十多米至数十米深的黄土层，大修连环水井，同时拦住沟壑水流和地面水，筑起星罗棋布的高原水库和大小涝池，把水提引上塬，改变黄土高原的干旱面貌。
    董志塬在甘肃省东部庆阳县境内，拔海一千四百多米，总面积二千三百平方公里。塬上的降雨量全年只有五百毫米左右。下雨以后，雨水又挟带着地面沃土直泻沟底。塬面距河床一般有二百多米，沟底和地下虽然有水，塬上却很干旱，粮食产量很低。解放以后，党领导人民开始了水利建设，特别是建立人民公社以来，县委第一书记亲自领导后官寨人民在黄土层深处修成连环串井，把水引上塬，树立高原兴修水利的榜样。去冬，塬上各公社大兴水利，创造了一套丰富多采的高原兴修水利经验。
    董志塬人民创造的高原地下引水法，主要有四种：（1）在水源较多的地方开挖大型水井，大井周围再打几十眼井，与大井串通。这样水流就汇集一起，形成地下水库，安上高程提水机械即可提水灌田。这种地下水库首先在新民生产队试办成功，一个水库全年出水二十多万公方。（2）修筑连环串井，通过明渠暗道，引水出塬。如西峰人民公社后官生产队，沿着地下水流动方向，在两公里长的范围内，平均每隔十米就挖一眼井，接连挖了二百眼井，由四里的地下河道把两百眼水井串连起来，再流经九里的明渠，终于让黄土层深处的地下水流出塬面，全年引出的水量可达七十二万公方。（3）在所有麦地、秋地靠近耕作区边缘路旁，普遍打井，大修蓄水柜，每井一柜或一井多柜。水柜修在农田高处，进口修渠，出口安闸，做到常年蓄水，集中使用，自流灌溉。（4）在地形低洼、水流充沛的地方；开挖大型渠道，引出地下水，大蓄大灌。
    在大挖地下水的同时，还大搞沟壑蓄水，提水上塬。在大小沟壑内自上而下修塘筑坝，使小水入塘，大水归库，实现沟底川台库塘化，全部拦蓄沟壑水、雨水和自流水。在此基础上，一方面开转山渠，引水上山；一方面安装抽水机和水车提水上塬。在山区拦河筑坝，绕山开渠，渠道周围池塘、坝库星罗棋布，使渠库相连，常年引水，常年蓄水，引水灌田。
    目前，董志塬上已修好高原水库和大小涝池七千个，可以蓄水一亿方，打井十五万眼，眼眼有水；提引沟水上塬工程五十处；明河暗道两处；连环串井二十处。元月上旬，董志塬和庆阳县其它地区的九万眼新修水井正式开渠放水，三天内就把六百多万方地下水引上了塬，加上背冰积雪，灌地五十多万亩。分布在全塬一百万亩耕地上的两万四千九百项水利设施，已全部发挥效益。目前正在结合以水利为中心的春耕准备工作，继续大修小型水利，大灌麦田，以便做到保耕保种，耕好种好，使全塬百万亩土地亩亩增产，块块丰收。
