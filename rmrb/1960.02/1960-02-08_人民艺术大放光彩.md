    People's Art Shines Splendidly

    An Extraordinary Performance
    In Pyongyang, we saw an extraordinary performance. This was a large-scale artistic program newly created collectively by Korean artists – the musical and dance narrative poem "Our Glorious Motherland," jointly staged by more than twenty professional art troupes and more than ten amateur art troupes, totaling three thousand actors. They concentrated the essence of various artistic achievements in Korea since liberation, using recitation poetry, chorus, and folk song and dance forms to express Korea's modern history; expressing a series of great scenes from colonial rule to liberation, from war to peaceful construction.
    The curtain opened, and a huge flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea flashed on the stage. On both sides of the stage were arranged a chorus of one thousand two hundred people, accompanied by a national orchestra of three hundred and fifty people and a Western orchestra, singing the chorus "Motherland."
    Then, a flash of light, and iron bars and chains appeared on the backdrop, bringing the audience back to the darkest years of Korea in 1910. Under the rule of Japanese imperialism, Korean people, men, women, old and young, were bound by ropes, struggling painfully in a hellish life full of disasters. Suddenly, a loud noise shattered the heavy, sad atmosphere on the stage. This was the sound of the guns of the Aurora cruiser. Color slides were projected on the backdrop, and the brilliant images of Lenin, the red flag, and the Kremlin replaced the iron bars and chains, giving people an indescribable sense of excitement and comfort. The victory of the October Revolution encouraged the Korean people, who launched a successive struggle against Japanese imperialist colonial rule. The anti-Japanese guerrillas led by General Kim Il-sung marched onto the stage with majestic steps. The snow clothes on their bodies fluttered in the wind, like eagles appearing and disappearing in the dense forests of Changbai Mountain, fighting hard in the wind and snow, and attacking the enemy.
    Solemn and magnificent historical scenes appeared one after another on the stage. The Soviet Red Army liberated Korea, and the azalea flowers and fan dances all over the mountains symbolized the happy life of the people after liberation; the Korean and Chinese people's armies fought side by side, resisting the heroic struggle against the American imperialist aggression; the armistice was realized, and peace doves flew all over the sky; the Korean people began to carry out post-war reconstruction work, and rushed forward on the Chollima…
    Many moving scenes reflecting the period of post-war peaceful construction also appeared on the stage.
    The dance "Iron Water Flows" expresses the heroic feeling of the Korean people fighting for steel. This is based on the rhythm of various actions of steelworkers operating in front of the furnace, and is compiled into a vibrant collective dance. After the workers danced, there was a scene of tapping iron from the furnace. A team of girls wearing red silk skirts rushed out from behind the curtain, like molten iron pouring out; the red water sleeves in their hands fluttered in the wind, like the flames of molten iron coming out of the furnace, spraying fiercely, slowly rising and falling, gradually stopping…
    The background projected by the lantern on the curtain was constantly changing, and seven hundred dancers walked onto the stage in an endless stream, singing and dancing, leading the audience to various production and construction sites. In front of a tall dam, rows of girls wearing green silk clothes showed their slender figures, rising and falling lightly, forming a vast reservoir of blue waves. This is a moving scene of rural water conservancy construction. Water conservancy irrigation has brought a bumper harvest. Golden rice, bright red apples, and purple grapes, in groups, singing and dancing, bring the audience into a charming fairy tale world.
    This large-scale artistic program adopts an ingenious flowing performance method, with no curtain dropping during scene changes. Lighting is used to control the transitions between scenes, and colored slides are used for scenery. The musicians and dancers participating in this collective creation displayed a high degree of cooperation, learning from each other and cooperating closely, so that this large-scale epic maintained harmony and coherence from beginning to end in terms of content and artistic style. The entire program lasted for two hours, completed in one go, and was very compact, strongly attracting the audience from beginning to end. As Korean artists pointed out, this program is an unprecedented creation in the history of Korean art, both in terms of scale, ideological content, and artistic level. In two hours, through exquisite and beautiful artistic language, we read a modern history of Korea, a patriotic poem, and a poem about the victory of Marxism-Leninism in Korea.

    Inheritance and Development of National Art Traditions
    In 1959, Korean young artists participated in the 7th World Youth Festival in Vienna, and their performance was praised as "golden art" and won seventeen gold medals. During our visit to Korea, we had the opportunity to see these award-winning programs. These programs are fresh, lively, heroic, and optimistic. Some are like a breeze blowing on your face, making you feel refreshed; some are like a bugle call, making your blood boil. Korean national art was originally very beautiful, and with the infusion of brand-new socialist content, it shines even more brightly. The honors won by these young artists who grew up under the cultivation of the Republic show how brilliant achievements Korean art has made in recent years. This is the result of Korean artists following the Labor Party's literary and artistic policies and correctly inheriting and developing the fine traditions of national art.
    Since ancient times, the Korean people have always been known for their ability to sing and dance. The working people have created countless beautiful and moving folk songs, dances, and operas, reflecting their working lives, the beautiful mountains and rivers of the motherland, and the patriotic ideas of the people. These creations have formed a rich artistic treasure.
    After liberation, the Korean Labor Party led artists to criticize the erroneous idea of ​​holding a nihilistic attitude towards national art, and advocated going deep into the masses to discover and sort out the national art that had been buried by the long-term colonial rule of Japanese imperialism.
    Korean artists have done a great job in this regard. Composers have discovered and sorted out more than a thousand folk songs; one of the choral programs that won a gold medal at the 7th World Youth Festival last year – "The Boatmen's Song of Fasongpo" – was discovered and sorted out by People's Actor An Giyok. "Vast sea, oh vast sea…" This powerful and vigorous singing not only expresses the labor life of generations of Korean fishermen who are not afraid of wind and waves, and conquer the ocean, but also reveals the heroic spirit of the Korean people who are unyielding, fearless of violence, and despise difficulties.
    The Korean opera and puppet show, which have a long tradition, were on the verge of death before liberation due to the strangulation of the Japanese rulers. The artists were scattered, and there was no one to carry on. After liberation, the Korean Labor Party used great efforts to save these national operas and give them new life. The four major traditional programs of Korean opera – Chunhyangjeon, Simcheongjeon, Heungbujeon, and Rabbitjeon – have all been processed and reorganized to meet the audience with a brand-new look. Chunhyangjeon and Simcheongjeon have also spread to our country and are performed by many of our opera types, and are loved by the people.
    The famous Korean writer Han Sorya told us that, according to the literary and artistic policies of the Korean Labor Party, inheriting the national artistic tradition is to develop it; it is to use national forms to express socialist content, to express today's Chollima era, and the lives of today's working people. Korean artists have followed this policy of the Labor Party, have already made many outstanding achievements, and are striding forward on this broad road.
    For example, most of the Korean national dances in the past originated in rural areas and mainly expressed the working life of farmers; some were court dances of feudal dynasties. But today, Korean artists have further used the form of national dance to express various aspects of life such as war, construction, and steelmaking. Korean opera is similar to Peking opera in China, and in the past it only performed historical stories. But today, Korean artists have begun to use it to express modern life. The opera "Song of the Yellow Sea," which was recently staged in Pyongyang, tells the story of the patriotic martyr Cho Ok-hee being arrested and bravely unyielding and sacrificing heroically during the Fatherland Liberation War.
    While inheriting and developing national art, Korean artists also pay attention to absorbing valuable experiences from foreign art, and correctly handle the relationship between the two, so that national art can absorb rich nutrition and thus be more healthily developed.

    Throwing Oneself into the Torrent of Mass Struggle
    Today, one of the important reasons why Korean national art can be so rich and colorful is that Korean artists have responded to the call of the Labor Party and resolutely gone deep into the working class and peasant masses, so that art is further connected with the lives of the people.
    In September 1958, after the Central Committee of the Korean Labor Party issued a "red letter" calling on all party members and working people to launch a great Chollima advance, artists actively plunged into the torrent of the working people building socialism. More than 80% of the artists went to factories and rural areas, worked and lived with the working class and peasant masses, and obtained rich sources of creation.
    A composer said it well: In the past, when creating, I sat at home and played the piano, and I couldn’t get out of the circle of classical writers. Today, going to the masses, going to the boiling life, there are incredibly rich sounds and colors there.
    The famous song "Rest on the Construction Site," which won a gold medal at the World Youth Festival last year, was created in this way. The twenty-five-year-old young composer Li Dongjun went to the construction site in Pyongyang and saw the young builders there resting during the tense work, wiping sweat with their fists, tapping on wooden buckets and singing and dancing. This enthusiasm and optimism for building the motherland greatly infected Li Dongjun. He went back and created the famous song "Rest on the Construction Site," using a light and passionate melody to sing the enthusiastic enthusiasm and high optimism of the young builders. The song begins with the sound of tapping wooden buckets, "Dong da la, dong da la," followed by a bold singing: "Dance as much as you like, sing loudly, there is no better place in the world than the construction site." Li Dongjun said when talking about his creative experience: It was the young builders who really created this song, I just recorded it and sorted it out.
    The creative process of the dance drama "Red Heart," which was extremely popular among the working masses on the Korean stage last year, also illustrates this point. Young dancer Jiang Yucai went to the Seongjin Steel Plant and made friends with the steelworkers. The steelworkers' response to the Party's call and their selfless actions for steel deeply moved her. She studied and created with the workers, and compiled this dance drama expressing steelmaking.
    When this dance drama was performed at the Seongjin Steel Plant, the workers took Jiang Yucai's hand and said: "Thank you for putting our steelworkers on the stage." Jiang Yucai said: "It is your loyalty to the Party and your heroic labor that educated me and moved me, so I was able to compile this dance drama." This is the relationship between Korean artists and the working people today.

    Deep Roots and Lush Foliage
    One of the characteristics of the prosperous development of the Korean art cause is the widespread development of mass art activities. Almost every factory, rural village, fishing village, institution, and school has its own amateur art group. At present, there are more than 70,000 such amateur art organizations in northern Korea, including approximately 1.7 million amateur art workers. On average, almost every family has an amateur art worker. This is simply a nationwide art army.
    The broad masses of working people have mastered the art weapon themselves, they write, direct, and perform themselves, singing praises to the new life and promoting production. For example, at the Bengong Chemical Plant, which produces calcium carbide, the workers compiled and performed the "Calcium Carbide Dance"; at the Pyongyang Textile Factory, the workers compiled and performed the dance "Textile Workers," describing the process from planting cotton to weaving cloth. In March last year, the employees of the Yongcheng Machinery Factory began to use their spare time to produce a giant eight-meter vertical lathe. In order to promote this work, the factory's amateur art group compiled and performed an opera with the theme of manufacturing an eight-meter vertical lathe, praising the advanced thinking of daring to think and daring to do, satirizing and criticizing technical mystics, educating the broad masses of employees, and promoting the completion of production tasks.
    The amateur art groups in rural areas are also very active. In the Yongwuli Agricultural Cooperative in Wende County, we watched a performance by the amateur art group. Most of the programs were compiled by themselves, including the chorus "The Day of Distribution" praising the agricultural cooperative, the skit "The Sixth Work Team Leader" praising advanced figures, and the puppet show "Fat Cow and Thin Cow" criticizing the breeder. These programs are all very lively, relaxed, and pleasant. The actors on the stage are sons, nephews, brothers, and sisters, and the audience off the stage are mothers, uncles, sisters, and brothers. Every time there is a performance, the entire community is happy, and the whole family is happy. This kind of flavor cannot be tasted by watching the performances of any professional art group.
    In order to promote the development of mass art, Korea holds a general assembly every year. The general assembly starts from the grassroots level, selecting layer by layer, all the way to the central level. Every year, the general assembly produces a large number of excellent programs from amateur art groups, and many of them become popular programs nationwide and are widely loved.
    This art army not only produces programs, but also cultivates reserve forces for professional art groups. Hong Zhenghua, the twenty-one-year-old young actor who won a gold medal for dancing the "Joyful Dance" at the 7th World Youth Festival, was originally a dancer in an amateur art group in an agricultural cooperative.
    The people have infinitely rich talents and wisdom, and the people are the creators of all material and spiritual wealth in the world. Korean art is deeply rooted in the broad masses of working people, which guarantees that it can bloom luxuriant flowers and bear abundant fruits.

    人民艺术大放光彩
    王玉章
    一次不平凡的演出
    在平壤，我们看了一次不平凡的演出。这是朝鲜的艺术家们新近集体创作的一个大型艺术节目——音乐舞蹈叙事诗“我们光荣的祖国”，由二十多个专业艺术团体和十多个业余艺术团体的三千个演员联合上演。他们集中了解放后朝鲜各种艺术成就的精华，用朗诵诗、大合唱和民族歌舞形式表现朝鲜的近代史；表现从受殖民统治到解放，从战争到和平建设的一系列伟大场面。
    幕开了，一面巨大的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国旗闪现在舞台上。舞台两旁排列着一千二百人的大合唱队，由三百五十人组成的民族管弦乐队和西洋管弦乐队伴奏，唱起了大合唱“祖国”。
    接着，灯光一闪，背幕上现出铁窗和锁链，把观众带回到1910年朝鲜最黑暗的年代。朝鲜人民在日本帝国主义统治下，男女老幼被绳索捆绑，在地狱一样灾难重重的生活中痛苦挣扎。突然，一声巨响震破了舞台上沉重、悲伤的气氛。这是阿芙乐尔号军舰的炮声。彩色幻灯打在背幕上，列宁、红旗和克里姆林宫的光辉形象代替了铁窗、锁链，使人感觉到一种说不出的振奋和舒畅。十月革命的胜利鼓舞着朝鲜人民，他们前仆后继地展开了反对日本帝国主义殖民统治的斗争。金日成将军领导的抗日游击队，迈着雄壮的步伐走上舞台。他们身上的雪衣迎风飘动，像雄鹰一样在长白山的密林里出没，在风雪中艰苦战斗，打击敌人。
    庄严宏伟的历史场面，一个接着一个在舞台上出现。苏联红军解放了朝鲜，满山的金达来花和扇子舞象征着解放后人民的幸福生活；朝中人民军队并肩作战，抗击美帝国主义侵略的英勇斗争；停战实现了，和平鸽满天飞翔；朝鲜人民开始进行战后的恢复建设工作，跨上千里马向前飞奔……。
    舞台上也出现许多反映战后和平建设时期的动人的景象。
    舞蹈“铁水奔流”表现朝鲜人民为钢铁而战的豪迈心情。这是根据炼铁工人在炉前操作时各种动作的节奏加以美化，编成一个充满着活力的集体舞蹈。工人舞罢，接着是高炉出铁的场面。一队穿着红绸裙衣的少女，从幕后疾驰而出，像铁水倾泻奔流；她们各人手上的红水袖迎风飘动，像出炉铁水的火焰，猛烈喷射，缓缓起伏，逐渐停熄……。
    布幕上幻灯照出的背景不断变换，七百个舞蹈家川流不息地走上舞台，载歌载舞，把观众引导到各式各样的生产建设现场。在一座高大的水坝前面，一排排穿着绿色绸衣的姑娘，显示出苗条的身段，轻盈起伏，构成一个碧波荡漾的大水库。这是农村水利建设的动人景色。水利灌溉带来了丰收。金黄的稻谷、鲜红的苹果和紫色的葡萄，成群结队，高歌漫舞，把观众带进一个迷人的童话世界。
    这个大型艺术节目采用别出心裁的流水演出法，换场不下幕，各场之间用灯光控制，用彩色幻灯布景。参加这一集体创作的音乐家和舞蹈家们，发挥了高度的协作精神，互相学习，密切配合，使这个大型史诗从内容到艺术风格，自始至终保持调和、连贯。整个节目演出的时间是两小时，一气呵成，非常紧凑，从头到尾都强烈地吸引着观众。正如朝鲜的艺术家们所指出的，这个节目无论在规模上，在思想性和艺术水平方面，都是朝鲜艺术史上的一个空前创举。我们在两小时内，通过精湛优美的艺术语言，读了一部朝鲜近代史，一部爱国主义的诗篇，一部马克思列宁主义在朝鲜取得胜利的诗篇。
    民族艺术传统的继承和发展
    1959年，朝鲜的青年艺术家们在维也纳参加第七次世界青年联欢节，他们的表演被誉为“黄金的艺术”，获得了十七枚金质奖章。我们在访朝期间，曾有机会看到这些获奖的节目。这些节目清新、活泼、豪迈、乐观。有的像晨风拂面，使人神清气爽；有的像进军号角，使人热血沸腾。朝鲜的民族艺术本来就是很优美的，再加上灌入了崭新的社会主义内容，就更放出百倍的光彩。这些在共和国的培育下成长起来的青年艺术家所获得的荣誉，说明了朝鲜的艺术在近几年来取得了多么光辉的成就。这是朝鲜的艺术家们遵循着劳动党的文艺政策，正确地继承和发展民族艺术的优良传统的结果。
    自古以来，朝鲜人民一向以能歌善舞著称。劳动人民创作了无数优美动人的民谣、舞蹈和戏曲，反映他们的劳动生活、祖国的美丽山川和人民的爱国主义思想。这些创作形成了一个丰富的艺术宝藏。
    解放后，朝鲜劳动党领导艺术家们批判了那种对民族艺术持虚无主义态度的错误思想，提倡深入群众，去发掘和整理由于日本帝国主义长期殖民统治而被湮没了的民族艺术。
    朝鲜的艺术家们在这方面作了巨大的工作。作曲家们发掘和整理了一千多首民谣；去年在第七届世界青年联欢节上得了金质奖章的合唱节目之一——“法圣浦船夫曲”，就是人民演员安基玉发掘整理出来的。“茫茫的苍海哟……”，这苍劲雄健的歌声不仅表达了历代朝鲜渔民不怕风大浪高，征服海洋的劳动生活，而且透出了朝鲜人民那种百折不屈、不畏强暴、蔑视困难的英雄气概。
    具有悠久传统的朝鲜唱剧、木偶剧，由于日本统治者的扼杀，在解放前已濒于死亡的边缘。艺人星散，继后无人。解放后，朝鲜劳动党用很大的力量把这些民族戏曲拯救过来，使它们得到新生。朝鲜唱剧的传统节目四大传——春香传、沈清传、兴甫传、兔子传都经过加工整理，以崭新的面貌重新同观众相见。春香传和沈清传并流传到我国，为我国许多剧种所演出，受到人民的喜爱。
    朝鲜著名作家韩雪野告诉我们，根据朝鲜劳动党的文艺政策，继承民族艺术传统是为了发展它；是为了用民族形式来表现社会主义的内容，表现今天的千里马时代，今天劳动人民的生活。朝鲜的艺术家们遵循劳动党的这个方针，已经作出了许多优异的成绩，并且正沿着这条康庄大道快步前进。
    例如，朝鲜的民族舞蹈，过去大部分产生自农村，主要表现农民的劳动生活；一部分是封建王朝的宫廷舞。但今天，朝鲜的艺术家们却进一步运用民族舞蹈形式来表现战争、建设、炼钢等多方面的生活。朝鲜的唱剧类似中国的京剧，过去只表演历史故事。可是今天，朝鲜的艺术家们已开始用它来表现现代生活。最近在平壤上演的唱剧“黄海之歌”，就是表演祖国解放战争时期爱国烈士赵玉姬被捕后英勇不屈、壮烈牺牲的故事。
    朝鲜的艺术家们在继承和发展民族艺术的同时，还注意吸收外来艺术的有价值的经验，正确地处理了两者之间的关系，使民族艺术吸取了丰富的营养，从而得到更健全的发展。
    投身在群众斗争的激流中
    今天，朝鲜的民族艺术能够这样丰富多采，一个重要的原因，是朝鲜的艺术家们响应劳动党的号召，坚决地深入到工农群众中去，使艺术进一步同人民生活相联系。
    1958年9月，朝鲜劳动党中央发出了号召全体党员和劳动人民展开千里马大进军的“红信”以后，艺术家们踊跃投入劳动人民建设社会主义的激流中。有80％以上的艺术家下厂下乡，同工农群众共同劳动，共同生活，获得了丰富的创作泉源。
    一个作曲家说得好，过去搞创作，坐在家里敲钢琴，敲来敲去还是离不开古典作家的圈圈。今天到群众中去，到沸腾着的生活中去，那里有无比丰富的声音和色采。
    去年在世界青年联欢节获得金质奖章的著名歌曲“工地上的休息”就是这样创作出来的。二十五岁的青年作曲家李东俊到平壤市的建设工地上去，看到那里的青年建设者们，在紧张的劳动间隙中休息，用拳头抹一把汗，敲着木桶就唱起来，跳起来。这种建设祖国的热情和乐观精神，给李东俊很大的感染。他回去就创作了“工地上的休息”这首名歌，用轻快而激昂的旋律，唱出了青年建设者们狂涛般的热情和高度的乐观主义精神。这首歌一开头就是“咚打拉，咚打拉”敲打木桶的声音，接着豪迈地唱道：“尽情地舞啊，高声地唱呀，世界上再没有比工地更好的地方。”李东俊谈创作的体会时说：真正创作这首歌的是青年建设者们，我不过把它记录下来，再加以整理罢了。
    去年在朝鲜的舞台上极受劳动群众欢迎的舞剧“红心”的创作过程，也说明了这一点。青年舞蹈家姜玉采到城津炼钢厂去，同炼钢工人交了朋友。炼钢工人响应党的号召，奋不顾身地为钢铁而战斗的行动深深地感动了她。她同工人们一边研究，一边创作，编成了这一部表现炼钢的舞剧。
    当这个舞剧在城津炼钢厂演出的时候，工人们拉着姜玉采的手说：“感谢你把我们炼钢工人搬上了舞台。”姜玉采说：“是你们忠诚于党，英勇劳动的行为教育了我，感动了我，我才能编出这个舞剧。”这就是今天朝鲜的艺术家同劳动人民的关系。
    根深叶茂
    朝鲜的艺术事业繁荣发展的特点之一是广泛地展开群众性的艺术活动。几乎每一个工厂、农村、渔村、机关、学校，都有自己的业余艺术小组。目前朝鲜北部有七万多个这种业余艺术组织，包括了约一百七十多万人的业余艺术工作者。平均计算，几乎每个家庭都有一个业余艺术工作者。这简直是一支全民性的艺术大军。
    广大劳动人民自己掌握了艺术武器，他们自编自演，歌颂新生活并推动生产。例如，在生产电石的本宫化学工厂，工人们编演了“电石舞”；在平壤纺织工厂，工人们编演了舞蹈“纺织工”，描写从种棉花到纺织出衣料为止的过程。龙城机械工厂的职工们，去年3月间开始用业余时间生产一台巨型的八米立式车床。为了推动这件工作，工厂的业余艺术小组就编演了一个以制造八米立式车床为主题的歌剧，歌颂了敢想敢干的先进思想，讽刺和批判了技术神秘论者，教育了广大职工，推动了生产任务的完成。
    农村中的业余艺术小组也很活跃。在文德郡龙五里农业社，我们看了业余艺术小组的一次演出，大部分节目都是他们自己编的，有歌颂农业社的合唱“分配的日子”，有表扬先进人物的小剧“第六作业班长”，还有批评饲养员的傀儡戏“肥牛和瘦牛”。这些节目都十分生动活泼，轻松愉快。台上的演员是儿子、侄女、哥哥、姐姐，台下的观众是母亲、叔叔、妹妹、弟弟。每逢演出，台上台下，全社欢喜，合家欢喜。这种风味是看任何专业艺术团体的演出都无法尝到的。
    为了推动群众艺术的发展，朝鲜每年举行一次大会演。会演从基层开始，层层选拔，一直进行到中央。每年会演都从业余艺术团体中涌现出大量的优秀节目，有许多成为全国流行，受到广泛喜爱的节目。
    这支艺术大军不仅出节目，还为专业艺术团体培养了后备军。在第七届世界青年联欢节上跳“欢喜舞”获得金质奖章的二十一岁的青年演员洪正花，原来就是一个农业社业余艺术小组的舞蹈演员。
    人民群众有无限丰富的才能和智慧，人民群众是世界上一切物质财富和精神财富的创造者。朝鲜的艺术深深地植根在广大劳动群众中间，这就保证它能够开出繁茂的花朵，结出累累的果实。
