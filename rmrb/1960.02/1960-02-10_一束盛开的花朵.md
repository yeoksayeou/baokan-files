　　A Bouquet of Blooming Flowers

The Soviet people are currently engaged in communist construction with great enthusiasm. Building communism is the greatest interest and common ideal of the Soviet people. Communism is "the higher stage of development of socialism, when people engage in labor because they are consciously working for the common good" (Lenin). The facts provided in the above report eloquently illustrate that once Lenin's concept of communist labor is advocated and promoted, it can resonate deeply among the masses and significantly promote the cause of communist construction.

　　It is conceivable that when the "Communist Labor Team" first appeared at the Moscow-Ryazan railway marshalling station, and when textile worker Gaganova voluntarily went to work in a backward production team without remuneration, these "saplings" of communist style seemed "small," but precisely because they represented a bright future, they would surely grow into "large trees" covered with dense shade.

　　The style of the Soviet working people, who actively promote mutual assistance, common progress, and a communist attitude towards labor without remuneration, is a bouquet of blooming flowers in the current period of the comprehensive unfolding of communist construction in the Soviet Union.

    一束盛开的花朵
    苏联人民目前正在热火朝天地开展共产主义建设。建设共产主义，这是苏联人民的最大利益和共同理想。共产主义，这就是“社会主义发展的高级阶段，那时人们从事劳动都是由于觉悟到必须为共同利益而工作”（列宁）。上述报道中提供的事实雄辩地说明，列宁的共产主义劳动观念一经提倡推广，就能在人民群众中“一呼百应”，对共产主义建设事业发生显著的推动作用。
    可以想见，当“共产主义劳动队”在莫斯科—梁赞铁路调车站初次出现时，当纺织女工加干诺娃第一个不计报酬自愿到落后生产队工作时，这些共产主义风格的“幼芽”看来是“小”的，但是正因为它代表了远大的前程和未来，就一定会长成浓荫复盖的“大树”。
    苏联劳动人民这种积极发扬互相帮助、共同进步、不计报酬的共产主义劳动态度的风格，是目前苏联全面展开共产主义建设时期的一束盛开的花朵。
