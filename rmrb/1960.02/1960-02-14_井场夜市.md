    Oilfield Night Market
    On a freezing winter night, the drilling rig was tirelessly boring deep into the earth. In the distance, two bonfires suddenly lit up on the dark Gobi desert.
    “Let’s go to the night market!” Several workers on break stepped off the rig platform and walked towards the bonfires through the deep snow. The roaring flames danced, revealing colorful cigarettes and candies laid out on the snow. Li Jianxi, the director of the Baijiantan Store, set up an iron pot over one of the fires, in which steaming assorted dumplings were simmering; saleswoman Wang Caiqin placed a basket of rock-hard fried dough sticks, roasting them one by one over the fire, turning them repeatedly. The drilling workers came over and ate the hot snacks. It immediately became a lively night market.
    Since the discovery of the high-yield oilfield in Baijiantan, drilling teams have been dispatched here one after another. The Baijiantan Store has become the only supply point for thousands of workers and their families. The store doesn't have many staff. They work from early morning until late at night, and also spare manpower to organize mobile supply teams. The store clerks carry boxes of goods and walk to the extremely dispersed drilling sites to supply food, and also help the workers carry drill pipes and dig foundations.
    Last winter, the store started hosting night markets. Whenever the drilling teams were running casing, cementing, or organizing rapid drilling, the store staff would rush to the drilling site in the middle of the night to cook sweet dumplings, make lotus root powder, sell fried dough sticks, deep-fry fish, and sell various candies and cigarettes, so that the drilling workers could eat hot snacks in the severe winter nights, greatly boosting the workers' enthusiasm.

    井场夜市
    在一个滴水成冰的冬夜，钻机轰轰地向地层深处不停地钻进着。远处，黑漆漆的戈壁上突然升起了两堆篝火。
    “上夜市去”！几个休息的工人走下井台，踏着深深的积雪，朝着篝火走去。熊熊的火焰跳动着，只见雪地上摆着五颜六色的香烟、糖果。白碱滩商店主任李建西在一堆火上架起铁锅，锅里煮着热气腾腾的什锦元宵；营业员王彩琴把一筐子烤得硬邦邦的油条，放在火上一个个翻来复去地烤。钻井工人们端过来热腾腾的点心吃着。这里顿时成了热闹的夜市。
    白碱滩自从发现了高产油田以后，一个个钻井队就开到这里。白碱滩商店就成为几千名工人和家属唯一的供应点。这商店的工作人员并不多。他们从清早工作到深夜，还抽出人力组织流动供应小组。店员们扛着货箱步行到异常分散的井场供应食品，还帮工人扛钻杆、挖地基。
    去年冬天，商店开始举办夜市。每逢井队下套管、注水泥或组织快速钻进时，商店工作人员在深更半夜也要赶到井场去煮汤圆、冲藕粉、卖油条、油炸鱼和各种糖果、香烟，使钻井工人在严寒的冬夜能吃到热点心，大大鼓舞了工人的干劲。
