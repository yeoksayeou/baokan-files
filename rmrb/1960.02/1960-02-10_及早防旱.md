    Prevent Drought Early
    Currently, some areas in the Southwest, South China, Northwest, and North China regions are showing signs of drought, with some areas being quite severe. According to weather forecasts, rainfall will be scarce in most parts of China from February to May this year, especially in the Yellow River basin and the Southwest region, where drought conditions may continue to develop. These situations should be given deep attention by all localities. Measures must be taken early to prevent and combat drought, and strive to eliminate spring drought before spring plowing.
    The vivid facts of 1959 proved that with the tremendous collective strength of the people's communes and the heroic people full of energy, any natural disaster can be overcome. Last year, natural disasters such as drought, flood, wind, and pests came one after another, affecting an area of 650 million mu, which was the most severe disaster year since liberation and rare in past history. Facing such a serious situation, our heroic people, under the leadership of the Party and relying on the advanced organization of the people's communes, fought bravely against natural disasters with dauntless courage, and finally won the great victory of an 8% increase in total grain output and a 14.76% increase in total cotton output compared with 1958. This year's situation is much better than last year. Last year, the people's communes had just been established; this year, the people's commune organizations are more sound and consolidated and can exert greater power. Last year, people lacked experience in fighting major disasters; this year, the experience of struggle is richer, and with the large-scale water conservancy projects built last winter and this spring, the irrigated area has been expanded and improved, which provides greater strength to deal with natural disasters. Since last winter, Shaanxi Province has been threatened by drought, but under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the superiority of the people's communes has been fully utilized, and more than 3.6 million mu of drought-stricken farmland has been irrigated. From this, it can be seen that our people's ability to overcome disasters has been greatly strengthened.
    All areas where drought has occurred should start early to prevent and combat drought. Starting early can win time, gain the initiative, and comprehensively deploy the struggle against disasters, thereby turning major disasters into minor disasters, and minor disasters into no disasters. Man will conquer nature. This is a universal truth that our people have practiced in countless victorious struggles under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. In order to overcome all possible natural disasters, we must treat this issue seriously and conscientiously, and not be negligent in the slightest. Some people believe that since there was a major drought last year, the worst in decades, there will be no drought this year. This idea is very harmful. In fact, hasn't drought already occurred in some areas? It is also arbitrary to say that there will definitely be no major drought this year. In China's history, there have been cases of considerable areas suffering from consecutive years of severe drought. In the Yangtze River basin, during the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty, in 1678 and 1679, more than ten to thirty counties in each of Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces suffered from drought for two consecutive years; from 1662 to 1666, more than ten to thirty counties in Jiangxi suffered from drought for five consecutive years. In the Yellow River basin, during the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, there was drought for five consecutive years from 1875 to 1879; especially in the middle three years, more than ten or even dozens of counties in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, and Shaanxi provinces suffered from severe drought for consecutive years. Of course, under the current conditions, even if severe droughts occur continuously, the Chinese people have ways to deal with them. However, the question is whether there is sufficient mental and material preparation. If full preparations are not made in advance, one will still be in a passive position when the time comes. Therefore, based on the principle of prioritizing prevention and emphasizing both drought prevention and drought resistance, areas where drought has already occurred must immediately fight drought; areas where drought has not yet occurred but may occur should make preparations for drought prevention. Any negligence can lead to major mistakes. There are also some people who believe that since many water conservancy projects have been built, there is no need to worry. This idea is also not conducive to winning the fight against natural disasters. Yes, many water conservancy projects have been built across the country this winter and spring, which has indeed greatly enhanced this year's drought resistance capacity; but it cannot be assumed that everything will be fine with water conservancy projects. It should be noted that some projects have only been initially completed and cannot exert great benefits for the time being; some projects have been completed long ago, but due to prolonged drought, water storage is not high. At the same time, about one-third of the country's cultivated land has not yet started water conservancy construction. Therefore, although the achievements in water conservancy construction are great, negligence must not be tolerated. We should fully utilize the strength of the people's communes and the support of the state, start from multiple aspects, and do a good job in preparing for drought prevention and drought resistance.
    The first task of current drought prevention and drought resistance is to accelerate the construction progress of water conservancy projects that can benefit this year and be completed before spring plowing, and achieve complete reservoirs and canals, complete equipment, and complete machinery, so that most of the water conservancy projects built last winter and this spring can play a role in the spring. At the same time, attention should also be paid to the "blank spots" in water conservancy, or the dead corners of drought in various places. In these areas, fewer water conservancy projects have been built, and there is a lack of backbone projects. Now, the masses should be widely mobilized to do some small or temporary drought resistance projects, develop water sources, and eliminate the "dead corners" of water conservancy. For large and medium-sized water conservancy projects that are expected to play a role in water storage and flood control before the flood season, it should be guaranteed that they will be completed on time and with quality; for those that are not expected to be completed before the flood season, proper arrangements must be made to switch to year-round construction.
    Spring irrigation is a decisive battle in the current drought prevention and drought resistance. Early spring irrigation of winter wheat can not only prevent drought and frost, but also allow it to return to green earlier, tiller stronger, and lay a reliable foundation for more ears, larger ears, more grains, and fuller grains. Early spring irrigation is closely related to the timely sowing of spring crops and the timely transplanting of early rice. Advancing spring irrigation can also lengthen the irrigation water use time, expand the irrigated area, and maximize the effectiveness of limited water conservancy facilities. In order to carry out spring irrigation work early, abundantly, and well, it is necessary to mobilize the broad masses to find ways to increase water sources and store water and conserve soil moisture. Areas with rain and snow should seize the opportunity to store water and accumulate snow. All old and newly built reservoirs and ponds should pay attention to preventing leakage and conserving water, and strive for full ponds and level reservoirs, without losing a drop of water. When developing water sources, attention should also be paid to finding mountain springs and developing groundwater, gathering many small springs and trickles, so that they can play a greater role at a certain time. Many areas in Henan have used this method to enhance their drought resistance capacity. Drainage and irrigation machinery should also be repaired and installed as soon as possible, and large-scale tool reforms should be carried out to manufacture and promote simple water lifting tools. Wheat fields should be harrowed in spring in a timely manner to loosen the soil and conserve soil moisture; spring-sown land should also be plowed and harrowed earlier to conserve moisture.
    To do a good job in drought prevention, drought resistance, and irrigation work, especially spring irrigation work, the most important thing is to give full play to the unified leadership role of the people's communes. The people's communes in various places should make overall plans, form strong teams, adjust the irrigation system, formulate reasonable systems, improve water use technology, and speed up the work progress. The production units and irrigation management organizations of the people's communes must cooperate closely, investigate and study, and calculate the "water accounts" clearly. For example, how much water is available now, how much water is needed, how much more water can be developed with further efforts, where and when which crops need water the most, how long it takes to irrigate the land, and how much labor and mechanical power are needed, all must be calculated clearly, and positive and feasible water use plans must be put forward. In this way, it can be guaranteed that the existing water will be used to the greatest effect, and the rational use of water can be closely combined with further development of water sources. All water conservancy facilities should be used in the most rational and effective way according to the overall plan, distinguishing between priorities and urgencies. Local interests must be subordinated to the overall interests; for units that spend a lot of labor but benefit less, appropriate methods should be adopted to compensate them from other aspects basedบนthe spirit of cooperation and mutual benefit. The masses should be fully mobilized to discuss and develop the annual water use plan and spring irrigation plan; after the plan is formulated, it must be implemented at all levels to ensure that these plans are implemented.
    Whether drought prevention, drought resistance, and irrigation work are done well depends on whether a mass movement is launched on a large scale to mobilize the broad masses to join the battle. Last year, the drought situation in Yiyang County, Hunan Province, was very serious. Not only was the field short of water, but even the canteen had difficulty with drinking water. The commune immediately organized a large labor force of 20,000 people, set up 1,800 waterwheels, passed through thirteen mountain ridges and 160 mountain tops, and diverted water from the Huangjia Lake twelve miles away to irrigate the fields, overcoming the threat of drought and winning a bumper harvest. Such examples were found in various drought-stricken areas across the country last year. These vivid examples should be used to educate the people about man's ability to conquer nature, promote the spirit of communist cooperation, and promote the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act in the struggle against drought prevention and drought resistance. We must strive to work hard, work practically, and work skillfully. The people's communes should closely integrate production with the training of water conservancy and irrigation personnel, accelerate the expansion of the technical team, and improve the technical level. Various localities have accumulated a lot of successful experience in rational water use, such as small furrow and frequent irrigation and small stream ditch irrigation in dry farming areas, and rational drainage and irrigation and moist irrigation in rice areas; every full-time staff member in every commune and every team should be able to master these advanced technologies according to local conditions.
    The drought situation is alarming, and time is very pressing. However, the members of the people's communes are the masters of nature and the masters of time. Since they were able to overcome such serious disasters last year by relying on the strength of the great collective, and also built so many water conservancy projects in the cold winter and spring season, then now we have full confidence and assurance to put out the spring drought and all other natural disasters, and lay a victorious foundation for the year's anti-disaster struggle.

    及早防旱
    目前西南、华南、西北和华北部分地区，都有旱象露头，其中部分地区较为严重。据气象预报：今年2月到5月，我国大部地区少雨，特别是黄河流域和西南地区，旱象还有可能继续发展。这些情况应当引起各地深切的注意。必须及早采取措施，防旱抗旱，力争把春旱消灭在春耕之前。
    1959年的生动的事实证明：有了人民公社这样巨大的集体的力量，有了干劲冲天的亿万英雄人民，任何自然灾害都可以被战胜。去年一年间，旱、水、风、虫等自然灾害接二连三而来，受灾面积达到六亿五千万亩，是解放以来灾害最严重的一年，也是过去的历史上少有的。面对着这样严重的情况，我们的英雄人民在党的领导下依靠人民公社这个先进组织，以大无畏的勇气，同自然灾害进行英勇的搏斗，终于赢得了粮食总产量比1958年增长8％，棉花总产量增长14．76％的伟大的胜利。今年的情况比去年要好得多。去年是人民公社刚刚成立不久；今年人民公社组织更加健全，更加巩固，可以发挥更大的威力。去年，人们还缺少同特大灾害斗争的经验；今年斗争经验更加丰富了，再加上去冬今春的大兴水利，灌溉面积又有扩大和改善，这就有更大的力量对付自然灾害。陕西省去冬以来一直受着干旱威胁，但在各级党委领导下，充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，已使三百六十多万亩受旱的耕地得到了灌溉。由此可见，我国人民战胜灾害的能力是大大地加强了。
    一切发生旱象的地区都要及早动手防旱抗旱。下手早，可以赢得时间，争取主动，全面部署同灾害的斗争，从而使大灾变小灾，小灾变无灾。人定胜天，这是我国人民高举毛泽东思想红旗在无数次胜利斗争中实践得来的普遍真理。为了战胜一切可能的天灾，我们必须严肃认真地对待这个问题，一点也不能麻痹大意。有一些人认为，去年刚受了几十年未有的大旱，今年就不会再旱了。这种思想是很有害的。事实上，现在在一些地区不是已经发生了旱象吗？说今年绝对不会发生大旱，这也是一种武断。在我国历史上，相当大的地区连年大旱的情况是曾经发生过的。在长江流域，清朝康熙年间，1678年和1679年，江西、安徽、江苏等省连续两年每省有十多个到三十多个县受旱灾；1662年到1666年，江西连续五年有十多个到三十多个县受旱灾。在黄河流域，清朝光绪年间，1875年到1879年五年接连受旱；特别是中间的三年，河北、河南、山东、山西、陕西等省各有十多个以至几十个县连年大旱。当然，在目前的条件下，即使连续发生大旱，我国人民也是有办法对付的。但是，问题在于是否有充分的精神准备和物质准备。如果不先作充分准备，临事就仍然会陷于被动。因此，要本着以防为主、防旱抗旱并重的原则，在已经发生了旱象的地区要立即抗旱；还没有发生而又可能发生旱象的地区，要做好防旱准备工作。任何一点麻痹都会铸成大错。还有一些人认为，已经兴修了不少水利工程，就可以有恃无恐了。这种想法对战胜自然灾害的斗争也是不利的。是的，去冬今春全国又兴修了许多水利工程，这的确大大地增强了今年的抗旱能力；但是并不能认为有了水利工程就万事大吉了。应该看到，有的工程还只是初步完工，暂时还不能发挥很大的效益；有的工程虽然早已完工，但因久旱不雨，蓄水不多。同时，全国还有三分之一左右的耕地还没有动手兴修水利。因此，虽然水利建设成绩很大，也决不能麻痹大意。我们应该充分运用人民公社的力量和国家支援的力量，从多方面下手，把防旱抗旱的准备工作做好。
    当前防旱抗旱的第一项工作，就是对今年能够受益的春耕以前能够完工的水利工程，应该加快施工进度，并且做到库渠成套、设备成套、机具成套，使去冬今春修的水利工程大多数都能在春季发挥作用。同时，还应当注意，各地还有一些水利的“空白点”，或者旱片死角地区。在这些地区，水利工程修得较少，又缺乏骨干工程，现在应当广泛发动群众，做一些小型的或临时的抗旱工程，开辟水源，消灭水利的“死角”。对预计能在汛前发挥蓄水拦洪作用的大中型水利工程，应该保证按期按质完工；对预计汛前不能完工的，必须妥善安排转入常年施工。
    春灌是当前防旱抗旱的有决定意义的一个战斗。冬小麦及早春灌，不但可以防旱防冻，而且可以返青早、分蘖壮，为穗多穗大粒多粒饱打下可靠的基础。及早春灌，同春播作物的适时下种和早稻的适时栽插，都有密切的关系。提早春灌，还能加长灌溉用水时间，扩大灌溉面积，使有限的水利设施发挥最大的效用。为了春灌工作进行得又早又多又好，就需要动员广大群众千方百计增辟水源和蓄水、保墒。下雨落雪的地区要抓紧时机蓄水积雪。对一切旧有的和新修成的水库水塘都要注意防漏保水，力求塘满库平，滴水不失。在开辟水源时，还要注意找山泉，开发地下水，把许多小泉细流汇集起来，使它们到一定的时机发挥较大的作用。河南就有不少地区利用这个办法，增强了防旱能力。对于排灌机械还应及早整修、安装，并且要大闹工具改革，制造和推广简易提水工具。麦田要适时春耙，以利松土保墒；春播地也要早些耕翻耙耱，以利涵蓄水分。
    要把防旱抗旱工作，特别是春灌工作做好，最重要的是充分发挥人民公社的统一领导的作用。各地人民公社要作出通盘的规划，组成强大的队伍，调整灌溉的体系，制定合理的制度，提高用水的技术，加快工作的进度。人民公社各生产单位和各个灌溉管理机构，必须紧密配合，调查研究，算清“水账”。例如，现有多少水，需要多少水，再作一番努力还可以开发多少水，什么地方什么时候什么作物最需要水，用多长时间可以浇完地，需要多少劳动力和机械动力等，都要计算得清清楚楚，提出积极而又切实可行的用水方案。这样，就能保证使现有的水发挥最大的效用，而且可以把合理用水和进一步开发水源密切地结合起来。一切水利设施都应当按照通盘的规划，分别轻重缓急，最合理最有效地使用。局部利益要服从整体利益；对于花费劳力多而受益较少的单位，应当根据协作、互利的精神，采取适当方式从其它方面给以补偿。要充分发动群众讨论，制定全年用水计划和春灌计划；计划制定之后，还必须层层落实，保证这些计划贯彻执行。
    防旱抗旱和灌溉工作做得好不好，决定于是否大搞群众运动，把广大群众动员起来，投入战斗。去年湖南益阳县迎丰公社旱情本来很严重，不仅田缺水，连食堂吃水也发生了困难，这个公社立即组织了两万劳动大军，架起一千八百辆水车，经过十三个山岭、一百六十个山头，从十二里外的黄家湖引水浇田，战胜了干旱威胁，夺得了大丰收。像这样的事例，去年全国各个干旱地区都有。应当运用这些生动事例向人民进行人定胜天的教育，提倡共产主义协作的精神，发扬在防旱抗旱斗争中敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，一定要做到苦干、实干加巧干。人民公社要密切结合生产训练水利和灌溉人员，加速扩大技术队伍，提高技术水平。各地已经积累了不少合理用水的成功经验，如旱作地区的小畦勤灌、细流沟灌，水稻地区的合理排灌、湿润灌溉，等等；应该使每个社每个队的专职人员都能按照当地具体条件掌握这些先进技术。
    旱情是值得警惕的，时间也是很紧迫的。但是，人民公社社员是大自然的主人，也是时间的主人。既然依靠伟大的集体的力量能够在去年战胜那样严重的灾害，而且在今年冬春季节又冒着严寒建设了那么多的水利工程，那末，现在我们完全有信心有把握扑灭春旱以及其它一切自然灾害，为全年的抗灾斗争打下胜利的基础。
