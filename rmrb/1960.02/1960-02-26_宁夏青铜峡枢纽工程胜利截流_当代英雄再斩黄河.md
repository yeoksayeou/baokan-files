Xinhua News Agency, Qingtongxia, February 25th. At 3:20 PM on the 24th, the dam of the Yellow River Qingtongxia Water Conservancy枢纽 Project was closed and the river was successfully dammed. Thus, the Yellow River, which has been difficult to tame for thousands of years, has been cut off in Ningxia by the heroes of our time after the dams at Sanmenxia, Yanguo Gorge, Weishan, and Liujia Gorge.

In order to save time and seize every second, the Qingtongxia builders broke all kinds of superstitions and adopted methods such as blasting ice and raising the water level in stages, creating a miracle of ice-season damming on the main stream of the Yellow River in our country, so that the Yellow River can benefit the Hui and Han people in the Ningxia region as soon as possible. On the evening of the 23rd, more than ten tons of explosives blasted open the inlet and outlet of the diversion channel, and part of the Yellow River flowed down through the twelve teeth of the dam along the newly excavated river channel, reducing the water pressure at the gap. The builders took the opportunity to speed up the encroachment of the training dikes overnight. They adopted both indigenous and modern methods, using trucks to throw stones, overhead cranes to transport soil, and cranes to lift large concrete prefabricated components and gabions, advancing towards the center of the river from both ends of the training dikes at the same time, advancing an average of three meters per hour, and the fastest reaching five meters. At 2:20 PM on the 24th, Comrade Zhao Zheng, the chief commander of the damming headquarters of the Qingtongxia Water Conservancy枢纽 Project Bureau, issued the final damming order. More than a dozen self-unloading trucks from Sanmenxia, Liujiaxia and other places, full of stone, gabions, and tetrahedral and hexahedral concrete prefabricated parts, poured them one by one into the increasingly narrow gap. After an hour of battle, the builders blocked the more than ten-meter-wide gap in one fell swoop. The Yellow River, which has dominated agricultural production in Ningxia for thousands of years, is now in the hands of the people. The responsible comrades of the Party and government of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and representatives of various cities and counties who were visiting on both sides of the river immediately cheered, and the sounds of gongs, drums, and firecrackers resounded through the Qingtong Gorge.

The Qingtongxia Project is a large-scale water conservancy枢纽 project that focuses on irrigation and integrates power generation and navigation. It is one of the first phase projects of the Yellow River cascade development. Since its commencement on August 26, 1958, more than 10,000 builders have held high the red flags of Mao Zedong Thought and the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, and with tenacious perseverance and bold innovation spirit, they have dug out four large faults with a total width of about 40 meters for the dam foundation with picks and hands, like gnawing on bones, and discharged 30 million cubic meters of seepage water, finally conquering the difficulties such as the broken dam foundation, many and wide faults, thick overburden, and particularly serious underground seepage, ensuring the excavation of the dam foundation and the pouring of concrete.

After the successful damming, a celebration meeting was held at the construction site. Comrade Li Jinglin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Committee, delivered a speech at the meeting. He said that the completion of the damming project can raise the water level of the Yellow River, and the water volume of the five major main canals in the eastern and western irrigation areas of the river will be guaranteed. This is a major event for the Hui and Han people of Ningxia.

    宁夏青铜峡枢纽工程胜利截流
    当代英雄再斩黄河
    新华社青铜峡25日电　24日下午三点二十分，黄河青铜峡水利枢纽工程的拦河坝合龙截流。至此，千年难驯的黄河，继三门峡、盐锅峡、位山、刘家峡截流之后，又在宁夏境内被我们时代的英雄拦腰斩断。
    青铜峡建设者为了抢时间，争分秒，早日使黄河为宁夏地区回、汉族人民造福，破除了种种迷信，采取炸冰和分期抬高水位等办法，创造了我国黄河干流上冰期截流的奇迹。23日傍晚，十多吨炸药炸开了导流明渠的进水口和出水口，黄河部分水流顺着新挖的河道，通过大坝十二个梳齿奔腾而下，减轻了龙口的水流压力。建设者连夜乘机加快戗堤进占速度。他们采取土洋并举的措施，利用汽车抛石，架天车运土，以吊车吊装大块混凝土预制件、铅丝笼，从戗堤两端同时向河心进逼，平均每小时进占三米，最快达到五米。24日下午二时二十分，青铜峡水利枢纽工程局截流指挥部总指挥赵征同志下了最后的截流合龙命令。来自三门峡、刘家峡等地的十几辆自卸大卡车，满装着石料、铅丝笼、四面体和六面体的混凝土预制件，一辆挨一辆地飞快地把它们倾泻到越逼越窄的龙口。经过一小时的战斗，建设者一举塞住了十余米宽的龙口。千百年来支配着宁夏农业生产的黄河，今天已掌握在人民手里。站在两岸参观的宁夏回族自治区党和政府的负责人以及各市、县代表，立刻发出欢呼，锣鼓声、鞭炮声，刹时震响了青铜峡谷。
    青铜峡工程是以灌溉为主综合发电、航运的大型水利枢纽，是黄河梯级开发的第一期工程之一。从1958年8月26日开工以来，一万多名建设者高举毛泽东思想和总路线、大跃进的红旗，以顽强的毅力和大胆革新精神，用洋镐和双手，啃骨头似地挖出了坝基总宽约四十米的四条大断层，排出渗水三千万立方米，终于征服了坝基破碎、断层多而宽、复盖层厚、地下渗水特别严重等困难，保证了坝基开挖和混凝土浇筑。
    截流胜利之后，工地举行了庆祝大会。中共宁夏回族自治区委员会书记处书记李景林同志在会上致词。他说，截流工程的完成，可以抬高黄河水位，河东、河西两大灌区的五大干渠的水量，就有了保证，这是宁夏回、汉族人民的一件大事。
