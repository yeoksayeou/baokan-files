    Supplying Fresh Water to Macao Compatriots
    Two Reservoirs Built in Zhongshan County, Guangdong, Completed
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 25th. The Zhuxian Cave and Yinkeng reservoir projects in Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, adjacent to Macao, have been fully or substantially completed, and preparations have been made for water supply, ready to supply fresh water for use by Macao compatriots at any time.
    Macao has long suffered from a shortage of fresh water for drinking, causing many difficulties for residents' lives. Representatives from all sectors of Macao have requested the Zhongshan County Party Committee and government to help solve this problem. The Zhongshan County Party Committee, following the instructions of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, accepted the request of representatives from all sectors of Macao in November of the year before last, and decided to build the Zhuxian Cave and Yinkeng reservoirs in the county to help Macao compatriots solve the "water shortage" problem.
    In order to quickly build these two reservoirs, the people of Zhongshan County displayed soaring enthusiasm and overcame many difficulties. From the start of construction to the present, the Zhuxian Cave Reservoir project has been fully completed, the main structure of the Yinkeng Reservoir has also been completed, and the 298-meter-long water conveyance channel, a quite arduous project, is nearing completion.
    Recently, the Macao area has experienced a prolonged dry spell. According to a report in the Macao Daily on February 23rd, the water storage in Macao's reservoirs is lacking. The people of the motherland are extremely concerned about this. The Zhongshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided that water can be supplied to Macao compatriots at any time, as long as they need it.

    输送淡水供应澳门同胞
    广东中山县兴建两水库完工
    据新华社广州25日电　广东中山县境内毗邻澳门的竹仙洞和银坑水库工程已经全部完工或基本完工，并已作好输水准备，随时可以输送淡水给澳门同胞应用。
    澳门食用的淡水，长期不足，使居民生活发生很多困难。澳门各界代表曾请求中山县党和政府帮助解决这一问题。中共中山县委遵照中共广东省委的指示，在前年11月接受了澳门各界同胞代表的请求，决定在县内建筑竹仙洞和银坑两个水库，以帮助澳门同胞解决“水荒”问题。
    中山县人民为了迅速建成这两个水库，发挥了冲天干劲，克服了许多困难。从动工兴建到现在，竹仙洞水库工程已全部完工，银坑水库主体工程也已完成，长达二百九十八米、工程相当艰巨的输水道已接近完工。
    最近澳门地区久晴不雨，据澳门日报2月23日报道，澳门水塘存水缺乏。祖国人民对此极为关切。中共中山县委员会决定，只要澳门同胞需要，随时可以输水给他们。
