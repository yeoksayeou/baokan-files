Yuecheng Reservoir Establishes a Construction Site Medical and Health Organization System
	Wherever There is Sickness or Injury, There is Medicine and Treatment
	Ministry of Health and Ministry of Commerce Jointly Convene On-Site Meeting to Promote This Experience
	(Our report) Yuecheng Reservoir in Hebei Province has established a "Four-Level Three-Network" system in its construction site medical and health work, ensuring that wherever there is sickness or injury, there is medicine and treatment. This has guaranteed the health of the construction personnel and improved construction efficiency. The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Commerce recently jointly held a national on-site meeting on medical and health work at water conservancy construction sites at this reservoir to promote their experience.
	Yuecheng Reservoir is located on the Zhanghe River southwest of Yuecheng Town in Cixian County, Hebei Province, and is one of China's large-scale water conservancy projects, currently employing approximately 200,000 migrant workers and construction site staff. While focusing on production and launching large-scale labor competitions, the reservoir's Party Committee also actively arranged medical and health work on the construction site. Led by the Party Committee Secretary, they fully mobilized the masses and established a complete construction site medical and health organization system.
	The "Four-Level Three-Network" system is: establishing "three networks" for medical care, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, and pharmaceutical supply at the four levels of the reservoir engineering bureau, construction corps, battalion, and company. The reservoir engineering bureau has a health department that leads the entire construction site's medical and healthcare work. It has three construction site hospitals and one infectious disease hospital, serving as the construction site's rear hospitals, responsible for treating more complex diseases that cannot be resolved by the first and second-line hospitals and providing technical guidance to the first and second-line hospitals. Each construction corps has a health clinic and sets up beds according to a certain proportion of migrant workers, which is the second-line hospital on the construction site. Each battalion has a health station, setting up isolation beds according to a certain proportion of migrant workers, which is the first-line medical unit of the reservoir. In the companies, more than 1,400 health workers have been trained. In terms of mass health organizations, "Patriotic Health Campaign Committees" have been established at all levels above the battalion, and companies have Patriotic Health Groups to lead the mass health and epidemic prevention work on the construction site. The reservoir has also successively established sixteen veterinary health institutions at all levels, including seven veterinary stations and nine veterinary clinics in the construction corps. Each battalion is equipped with part-time veterinary health cadres and full-time epidemic prevention personnel, forming a veterinary health network of more than 500 people. While establishing medical care and animal husbandry and veterinary prevention networks, the reservoir engineering bureau established a pharmaceutical management department, the commercial retail outlets of each construction corps, the sales points of each battalion, the construction site sales sheds, and mobile sales teams all concurrently operate in Chinese and Western medicines, forming a pharmaceutical supply network.
	Once the "Four-Level Three-Network" was established, it immediately demonstrated its enormous advantages. First, it solved the contradiction between the large number of migrant workers and the small number of professional medical and health personnel, combining professional medical staff with the vast force of non-detached health workers, turning health work into everyone's work. Non-detached health workers, i.e., outstanding migrant workers selected from the companies, cooks in the canteens, safety officers in the dormitories, specialized sanitation team members, livestock feeders, and commercial salespersons, etc., are trained by medical staff in batches without affecting production. Therefore, they know how to identify epidemics, use health kits, and treat minor injuries and illnesses.
	Because of the "Four-Level Three-Network," favorable conditions have been created for vigorously carrying out disease prevention work on the construction site. In addition to professional medical staff doing both medical and preventive work, the vast number of health workers distributed in various departments are also responsible for organizing the elimination of the four pests, checking personal hygiene and environmental hygiene, conducting epidemic investigations, health education, and labor protection. Recently, the health and epidemic prevention institutions at all levels of the reservoir have prominently focused on the following disease prevention and control work: First, preventing and controlling winter and spring infectious diseases. The health department promptly vaccinated everyone against typhoid fever, conducted stool tests on service personnel such as cooks, and quickly isolated and treated patients with unexplained high fever or confirmed typhoid fever, thereby preventing the spread of the epidemic. Second, grasping the management of feces and garbage. The entire reservoir launched a sanitary shock movement centered on large-scale fecal management, established toilets suitable for the needs of migrant workers, organized a specialized fecal management team, which cleared daily production and transported it for sealing and harmless treatment; for garbage and sewage, garbage pits were dug and seepage pits were built, filled and established as needed, which was both clean and sanitary and accumulated fertilizer. Third, grasping the cleanliness and sanitation of canteens, dormitories, individuals, and the environment. Partitioned stoves have been generally established in kitchens, and drinking water has been purified and disinfected. Work sheds have sanitation duty rosters. Individuals have established cleanliness and sanitation systems. In terms of environmental sanitation, each unit has divided sanitary responsibility areas to ensure that every piece is taken care of and every road is managed.
	The establishment of the "Four-Level Three-Network" has also improved pharmaceutical supply work. Due to the establishment of a complete pharmaceutical supply network, the timely supply of medicines and medical equipment has been ensured, making it possible to ensure that wherever there is illness, there is medicine and treatment, ensuring timely treatment of human and animal diseases.
	As a result of this series of work, the sanitary outlook of the construction site has been completely renewed in just three months. The incidence of disease among migrant workers decreased from 1.3% upon entering the construction site to 0.8%, the attendance rate increased from 95% to 98%, and the incidence of disease among livestock decreased from 11% in November 1959 to 6.8%, thereby promoting the completion of transportation tasks.

### 岳城水库建立一套工地医药卫生组织机构  哪里有病有伤　哪里有医有药  卫生部和商业部联合召开现场会议推广这一经验

    岳城水库建立一套工地医药卫生组织机构
    哪里有病有伤　哪里有医有药
    卫生部和商业部联合召开现场会议推广这一经验
    本报讯　河北省岳城水库在工地医药卫生工作方面建立了“四级三网”，做到哪里有病有伤，哪里有医有药。保证了建库人员的健康，提高了施工效率。卫生部和商业部最近在这个水库联合召开了全国水利工地医药卫生现场会议，推广了他们的经验。
    岳城水库在河北省磁县岳城镇西南的漳河上，是我国大型水利工程之一，现有民工和工地工作人员约二十万人。水库党委在抓生产、大搞劳动竞赛的同时，也积极安排了工地的医药卫生工作，由党委书记挂帅，充分发动群众，建立了一套工地医药卫生组织机构。
    “四级三网”是：在水库工程局、兵团、营、连这四级建立了医疗保健、畜牧兽医和医药供应“三网”。水库工程局设卫生处，领导整个工地的医疗保健工作。下设三个工地医院和一个传染病院，为工地后方医院，负责工地第一线和第二线医院不能解决的、比较复杂的疾病治疗，并对一、二线医院进行技术指导。各兵团设有卫生院，并按民工一定比例设置了病床，这是工地的第二线医院。各营设立了卫生所，按民工人数的一定比例设立隔离病床，这是水库的第一线医疗单位。在连队则培训了一千四百多名保健员。在群众性的卫生组织方面，营以上各级成立了“爱国卫生运动委员会”，连有爱国卫生小组，领导工地群众性的卫生防疫工作。水库还先后建立了各级兽医保健机构十六个，其中有各兵团的兽医站七个，兽医门诊部九个。各营都配备了兼职兽医保健干部和专职防疫员，组成了五百多人的兽医保健网。在建成医疗保健和畜牧兽医防治网的同时，水库工程局设立了一个医药经理部，各兵团的商业零售门市部，各营的代销点，工地售货棚和流动售货组都兼营中西成药，形成了一个医药供应网。
    “四级三网”一经建立，就立即显示了它的巨大优越性。首先，它解决了民工多而专业医药卫生人员少的矛盾，使专业的医护人员同广大不脱产的卫生保健员队伍结合起来，卫生工作变成了大家的工作。不脱产的卫生保健员，即连队里挑选出的优秀民工，食堂的炊事员，宿舍的安全员，粪便专业队员，畜牧饲养员，以及商业售货员等，在不影响生产的条件下，由医务人员分期分批培训。因此，他们懂得鉴别疫情，使用保健箱，能治疗小伤小病。
    由于有了“四级三网”，为工地大力开展预防疾病工作创造了有利条件。除了专业医护人员既作医疗工作，也作预防工作以外，分布在各部门的广大保健员还负责组织除四害、检查个人卫生和环境卫生，作疫情调查、卫生宣传和劳动保护等工作。最近，水库各级卫生防疫机构突出地抓了下列几项防治疾病的工作：一、防治冬春季传染病。卫生部门及时给大家进行了伤寒疫苗注射，对炊事员等服务人员进行了粪便检查，对不明高热患者或已确诊伤寒病人都迅速进行隔离治疗，因而杜绝了疫情蔓延。二、抓粪便和垃圾的管理工作。全水库开展了以大搞粪便管理为中心的卫生突击运动，建立了适应民工需要的厕所，组织了粪便管理专业队，日产日清，随即外运进行密封和无害化处理；对垃圾污水，挖了垃圾坑，修了渗水坑，随满随填随建立，既干净卫生又积了肥料。三、抓食堂、宿舍、个人和环境的清洁卫生工作。厨房普遍建立了隔山灶，对饮水进行了净化消毒工作。工棚设卫生值日。个人订了清洁卫生制度。环境卫生方面，各单位划分了卫生责任区，做到片片有人包，路路有人管。
    “四级三网”的建立，也改善了医药供应工作。由于建立了一套完整的医药供应网，保证了药品和医疗设备的及时供应，作到了哪里有病，哪里有医，哪里就有药，保证了人畜疾病及时治疗。
    由于作了这一系列工作，仅三个月时间，工地卫生面貌就焕然一新。民工发病率由进工地时的1．3％降低到0．8％，出勤率由95％上升到98％，牲畜发病率由1959年11月的11％减少到6．8％，从而促进了运输任务的完成。
