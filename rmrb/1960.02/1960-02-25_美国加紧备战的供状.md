A Confession of the United States Intensifying War Preparations
Wu Si

Recently, from the US government and Congress to the bourgeois press, there has been a fierce debate lasting nearly a month on the issue of missile and outer space exploration development. "Newsweek" called this debate one of the "biggest debates" since the debate before the end of the Korean War. The theme of the debate was whether the United States was "gradually becoming second" or was "at its most powerful time in terms of material and military strength"? This great debate is a confession of the US ruling group intensifying its war preparations.

The central issue that caused a dispute within the US ruling group this time was: How big is the "gap" between the US missile power and the Soviet Union? Is the "missile gap" the "gap" in the entire military power? There are two different estimates for such issues. US Secretary of Defense Gates and US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Twining and other military leaders, when testifying before the relevant committees of the Senate and House of Representatives, although they could not but admit the amazing achievements of Soviet science and technology and its advantages in missile development, they tried their best to narrow the "missile gap" between the United States and the Soviet Union, and categorically denied that there was a "gap in deterrent power" between the two countries due to this "missile gap." They also said that even if the Soviet Union has more long-range missiles than the United States in the next three years, it cannot be considered that the Soviet Union surpasses the United States in military power. Their argument is: First, the US intermediate-range missile power is increasing day by day, and long-range missiles will gradually approach the Soviet Union; second, the United States is "far ahead" of the Soviet Union in terms of strategic air force, submarines, and ground forces equipped with modern equipment. Eisenhower, Nixon, and Herter all supported the above testimonies of Gates and Twining. However, many members of Congress, especially Democratic members, and many bourgeois newspapers fiercely attacked this estimate as "too complacent" and "not facing reality," believing that the United States was "miserably behind" in missiles and outer space exploration. "New York Herald Tribune" columnist Lippmann wrote continuous articles lamenting that the United States was behind the Soviet Union in terms of military capability, outer space race, economic growth rate, and education, and that the United States had become a second-rate country. Even CIA Director Allen Dulles believed that the Soviet Union's current missile power far exceeded that of the United States, and "complacency" was not allowed in the future. Allen, director of the Information Agency, also doubted whether the United States could catch up with the Soviet Union in the space race. US Strategic Air Force Commander Power even disagreed with Gates's statement that he could maintain military superiority even in the case of missile backwardness. He said, "As long as there are about three hundred missiles, the Soviet Union can virtually destroy our (US) entire nuclear attack capability within thirty minutes. ... Half of these missiles only need to be intercontinental missiles."

Some American newspapers, especially Allen Dulles's testimony, revealed the truth about the American missile inferiority, which made Eisenhower furious. In order to repair his blown balloon, the Eisenhower government launched a propaganda campaign to "boast about American strength" or so-called "tell the truth," trying its best to conceal the fact that the United States has lost its military advantage and is far behind the Soviet Union in missiles and outer space exploration, in an attempt to "reassure American public opinion, allies, and countries that have not assumed obligations." But what this debate made the US government even more afraid of was when it touched on the social system. At a press conference on February 11, when a reporter asked whether the successful launch of the Soviet lunar rocket proved that the socialist system was superior to the capitalist system, he immediately touched the president's sore spot. He was furious and sternly rebuked this statement as "arrogant." However, the situation in which the East Wind prevails over the West Wind and the fact that the US "strength policy" has gone bankrupt can never be changed by Eisenhower's self-bragging and tantrums.

It should be seen that although there are different estimates of the balance of military power within the US ruling group and the debate is fierce, their basic starting point and the basic policies they advocate are consistent. Eisenhower stated in his State of the Union address that while talking about peace, the United States should strengthen its "deterrent power" "from a position of strength with a broad foundation." And the other party in the debate, including the Democrats who took the opportunity to conduct election propaganda, all demanded that preparedness measures be strengthened. As for the Democratic members of Congress and the like of Lippmann who demanded increased military budgets and mobilized the greatest "economic power" to develop missiles and space research, this cannot in any way explain that the Eisenhower government has not done enough in this regard. Eisenhower repeatedly retorted, "Please don't think that we should spend a penny more on defense than we have to." He specifically mentioned the appropriations used to develop missiles, "which are close to the point where money itself can no longer speed up the speed and accelerate the development." Therefore, "Newsweek" admitted that there is actually no difference between the parties in the current US debate on military policy, "Deterrence - this is precisely our (US) fundamental policy." Another article published by this influential magazine said triumphantly, "It is encouraging that the great debate of 1960 almost hit the center of this issue," that is, how to "conduct a difficult race to maintain" the so-called "rightful world status" of the United States. This means that behind the fierce quarrel, the defenders of the "strength policy" are anxiously demanding to step up the arms race, especially to accelerate the development of missiles, in order to reverse the military decline in the shortest possible time.

First of all, the focus of all the noisy debates is on how to buy time and quickly reverse the current backward situation of the United States in missiles and outer space exploration. And this is precisely one of the real purposes pursued by the US government in playing "peace" means. The testimony of US Secretary of Defense Gates openly admitted that the United States is "taking the necessary countermeasures" against the Soviet Union's superiority in missiles, and is striving to "relatively approach" the Soviet Union in the number of missiles it owns around 1962. The reason why Gates and others put forward the "new estimate" that the ratio of US-Soviet missile power will no longer be one to three in the next three years and that the "missile gap" will not exist is based on the huge plan of the United States to frantically promote "catching up" with the Soviet Union in missiles and space competition. Eisenhower also confirmed this in his State of the Union address and in his speech supporting Gates's testimony. The State of the Union address stated that the United States "must make full use of time and technology to test these long-range ballistic missiles that the United States did not have before," and "explore outer space more widely." Eisenhower emphasized at press conferences on January 26 and February 3 that the United States has particularly devoted itself to the development of intercontinental missiles, and "is not always thinking of following behind others" in outer space exploration. He also said, "We should always remember that our country is not sleeping... we are indeed doing this work." Glennan, director of the US National Interplanetary and Space Navigation Bureau, also revealed that the United States will strive to catch up with and surpass the Soviet Union in space in four or five years. As for the Democratic members of Congress Johnson and Symington, who attacked the Eisenhower government inside and outside Congress, as well as the famous commentators Lippmann and Alsop, they disagreed with Gates's estimate of missile power, but only because they believed that this estimate was not conducive to quickly shortening the "missile gap." Lippmann said that the "assumption" made by the Eisenhower government that "although the Soviet Union currently surpasses us in missiles, we are moving faster than the Soviet Union" would only prevent the United States from achieving greater "speed."

Secondly, the US government, in view of the fact that it will take a considerable amount of time to catch up with the Soviet Union in intercontinental missiles, in order to "offset" this "gap," is stepping up the development of medium-range missiles while desperately developing long-range missiles, and using medium-range missiles to equip strategic air forces, submarines, and ground forces, especially to strengthen the long-range strategic air force. Gates's testimony stated: "We are expanding our missile program, placing missiles on bombers, and putting submarines that can launch Polaris missiles into active service. We believe that doing so can offset any so-called missile gap, at least as far as the effectiveness of our deterrent power is concerned." The reason why Gates believes that the existence of a "missile gap" does not mean that there is a "deterrent power gap" and that the United States still maintains "comprehensive superiority" is based on this. Eisenhower's State of the Union address also pointed out that "the military missile program we are successfully implementing is not damaged by our current lack of very large rocket engines that are very much needed in long-distance space exploration." US Strategic Air Force Commander Power, while trying his best to incite the so-called "threat" from the Soviet Union, shouted even louder to use strategic bombers with hydrogen warheads to conduct "airborne alert" day and night to maintain "deterrence." And everyone knows that this "airborne alert" has been in effect, seriously threatening world peace. Power also requested increased appropriations to further strengthen the air force's missile power, so that "Hound Dog missiles can help us (the United States) attack into the Soviet Union" so as not to "lengthen the time it takes for us (the United States) to reach this point before it is too late." Naval and Army generals Burke and Brooke also requested increased appropriations for the development of various types of medium-range missiles in their testimony to strengthen submarines, aircraft carrier forces, and ground forces. The Eisenhower government is meeting this request, adding appropriations in this area, especially for the strategic air force. According to an article in the "New York Times" on January 18, in the past five years, the distribution ratio of appropriations from the US government to the various military services has been: Air Force 46%-48%, Navy and Marine Corps 28%, Army 23%-24%. Due to new equipment such as missiles, the Pentagon's allocation has continuously increased the Air Force's expenditures to 60%. At the same time, the work of the United States to test-launch these various missiles is being stepped up, which has long been an open secret.

Not only that, but military leaders at the Pentagon also proposed a "global strategy" plan in their testimony to strengthen the "defense power" of US allies and military groups while strengthening the US "deterrent power," expand US troops and military bases stationed abroad, especially missile bases. The "plan" mentioned by Eisenhower in his State of the Union address, which is carried out according to the "speed at which we can continuously strengthen our strength," includes "taking steps to arrange our military assistance to these allies on a longer-term basis" and "establishing a more sound collective defense system." This is precisely the specific content and practical steps of the "global strategy" proposed by the Pentagon's military leaders to Congress.

Third, military leaders at the Pentagon made no secret in their testimony that the purpose of the United States in frantically stepping up its arms expansion is to fully prepare for war. On January 19, when US Secretary of Defense Gates testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee, he openly flaunted that the two goals of the United States to simultaneously expand intercontinental missiles and medium-range missiles and strengthen "comprehensive superiority" were: "First, to prevent the outbreak of a major war by providing and maintaining the ability to launch retaliation if we are subjected to any major attack; second, to support US foreign policy and to provide and maintain the ability to use the necessary forces to prevent and limit local wars." Everyone knows that the United States has not been threatened by "any major attack." The so-called "preventing a major war" is actually preparing to launch a world war, including the "preemptive" war that the Pentagon generals have been clamoring for; the so-called "preventing and limiting local wars" is actually another exposure of the US plan to launch "limited wars," that is, local wars, that it is still focusing on preparing for because it is unwilling to repeatedly fail. Gates's reference to "supporting US foreign policy" precisely illustrates that launching "limited wars" is still an important part of the US current aggression plan.

Fourth, in this debate, the Pentagon's military leaders and the bourgeois kept press unanimously clamoring to point the spearhead of preparing to launch "local wars" or "limited wars" at the Far East region, while also pointing at the Middle East region and the Latin American region. US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Twining publicly said: "I think the Far East is protected in the same way as Pennsylvania (a state in the United States). It is protected by the Strategic Air Command and our (US) other weapon systems, regardless of whether they are based there." The testimonies of US Secretary of the Army Brooke and Chief of Staff of the Army Lanninzer revealed that the US Joint Chiefs of Staff has formulated a plan to wage war in Southeast Asia, including intervention in Laos and a "specific plan" formulated by the US Pacific Command. Brooke also specifically mentioned his recent conspiratorial activities in Taiwan and other Far East regions. During this activity, he openly clamored to expand the scope of US aggression to Jinmen and Mazu, and made unrestrained attacks on New China. US Chief of Naval Operations Burke, in requesting the accelerated development of "Polaris" missiles submarines, also said that the United States should be prepared to be able to "cope with more than two small conflicts at the same time, like the military operations that the United States engaged in in Lebanon and the Taiwan Strait in 1958." Many publications such as "Look," "U.S. News & World Report," etc., talked a lot about the US military deployment in the Far East and other regions, advocating greatly strengthening the missile and land, sea, and air force strength in South Korea, Okinawa, Japan, the Taiwan Strait, and South Asia, and "preparing for contingencies." If we link these clamors of "local wars" with a series of provocative military exercises recently conducted by the United States in the Far East, the Middle East, the Caribbean Sea, and the Panama Canal Zone, we can see more clearly how much the various remarks about peace and easing the situation are worth.

It can be seen from this that the dispute within the US ruling group reflects the panic and unease of the followers of the "strength policy" when they lose their "position of strength" due to the situation in which the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, but more importantly, it exposes the US frantic struggle to cover up its stepped-up war preparations by talking about peace. The people who are fiercely attacking the Eisenhower government's military policy are first and foremost the Democratic politicians who usually launch a noisy campaign in election years. In fact, none of the proposals they have put forward on any issue of stepping up war preparations are not plans and steps that the Eisenhower government is trying its best to engage in. Eisenhower said at a press conference on February 11 that the specific issues that were "widely publicized" and caused "disputes" were "any of which is a real problem to be solved in the US defense," and his government "has done its best." The difference is that Eisenhower does not approve of making a lot of noise, but wants to do things without fanfare. He proposed in his State of the Union address that he did not want to argue about policy issues in the election year. He said: "Every minute spent on unimportant disputes between the legislative and executive branches means that we lose a valuable minute to wisely formulate and implement coherent policies that seek our nation's survival and progress." What is the mystery in this? CIA Director Allen Dulles said it most frankly. He said this at a discussion on strategic issues at the US National Military Academy Reserve Officers' Training Corps last July:

"I know very well that many people have doubts in this regard (American strength), but I can assure you that we are more prepared, better coordinated, and more effective in dealing with this challenge (referring to the so-called challenge from the socialist camp) than you know. However, talking too much about plans and practices will only make the challenger vigilant about our countermeasures. Therefore, it is better to remain silent about criticism than to talk a lot about past achievements or future plans."

Now, this dispute has subsided due to Eisenhower's "annoyance" and "regret," but this dispute has thoroughly exposed what the United States is plotting behind the "peace" curtain. The US ruling group is not only trying to revive its military strength advantage, but also attempting to carry out a sudden attack or launch a "limited war" when the opportunity arises. This dispute in the US Congress is a vivid lesson for all peace-loving people in the world: We must always be vigilant against the enemies of peace.

    美国加紧备战的供状
    武斯
    最近，从美国的政府、国会到资产阶级报刊，在导弹和探索外层空间的发展问题上，进行了为期近一个月之久的激烈争吵。美国“新闻周刊”把这场争吵，称之为结束侵朝战争前进行的辩论以来的一次“最大的辩论”。辩论的主题是，美国“正在逐渐居于第二位”呢，还是“处在它的物质和军事力量最强大的时代”呢？这场大辩论，正是美国统治集团加紧备战活动的供状。
    这次引起美国统治集团一场争吵的中心问题是：美国导弹力量落后于苏联的“差距”究有多大？“导弹的差距”是否就是整个军事力量的“差距”？对于这类问题，有两种不同的估计。美国国防部长盖茨和美国参谋长联席会议主席特文宁等军事首脑，在参众两院有关委员会上作证时，虽然不能不承认苏联科学和技术的惊人成就和在导弹发展方面的优势，但却竭力缩小美国同苏联的“导弹差距”，而且断然否认由于这种“导弹差距”，两国存在着“威慑力量的差距”。他们还说，即使在今后三年内，苏联拥有的远程导弹仍多于美国，亦不能认为苏联在军事力量方面超过美国。其论据是，一、美国的中程导弹力量日益增强，远程导弹也将逐渐接近苏联；二、美国在以现代化装备的战略空军、潜水艇和地面部队方面的实力，比苏联“遥遥领先”。艾森豪威尔、尼克松和赫脱都支持盖茨和特文宁的上述证词。但是，国会的许多议员特别是民主党议员以及许多资产阶级报刊猛烈攻击这个估计“过于自满”、“不正视现实”，认为美国在导弹和探索外层空间方面“可悲地落后了”。“纽约先驱论坛报”著名专栏作家李普曼连续撰文哀叹，美国在军事能力、外层空间竞赛、经济增长率和教育方面都落在苏联后面，美国已成为二等国家了。就连中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯也认为苏联目前的导弹力量远远超过美国，未来亦不容“自满”。新闻署署长艾伦也怀疑美国能否在空间竞赛方面赶上苏联。美国战略空军司令鲍威尔作证时甚至不同意盖茨所谓在导弹落后的情况下仍能保持军事力量优势的说法，他说“只要有三百枚左右的导弹，苏联就可以在三十分钟之内实际上把我国（美国）的整个核攻击能力摧毁殆尽。……这些导弹只要一半是洲际导弹就行了”。
    美国的一些报刊，特别是艾伦·杜勒斯的证词，泄露了美国导弹劣势的真相，使得艾森豪威尔暴跳如雷。为了修补他那吹破了的气球，艾森豪威尔政府曾发动“夸耀美国实力”或所谓“说明真相”的宣传运动，竭力掩饰美国丧失军事优势，在导弹和探索外层空间方面大大落后于苏联的事实，企图“使美国舆论、盟国和没有承担义务的国家安心”。可是这场辩论使美国政府更加害怕的是当它触到了社会制度的时候。艾森豪威尔2月11日在记者招待会上，有记者提出苏联月亮火箭发射成功是否证明社会主义制度优于资本主义制度的问题，一下子就触到了这位总统的疼处。他勃然大怒，厉声斥责这种说法是“狂妄”的。但是，东风压倒西风的形势，美国“实力政策”破产的事实，决不是艾森豪威尔的自我吹嘘和大发雷霆所能改变的。
    应该看到，尽管美国统治集团内部对军事力量对比的估计有所不同，争吵激烈，但他们的基本出发点和他们所主张的基本政策则是一致的。艾森豪威尔在国情咨文中就表明，美国在侈谈和平的同时，要“从具有广泛基础的实力地位出发”，加强“威慑力量”。而争论的对方，包括乘机进行竞选宣传的民主党人，都无不是要求加强备战措施。至于民主党议员和李普曼之流要求增加军事预算，动员最大的“经济力量”发展导弹和空间研究，也丝毫不能说明艾森豪威尔政府在这方面做得不够。艾森豪威尔就一再反驳说，“请不要认为我们在防御方面应当比必须花的多花一文钱”。他特别提到用于发展导弹的拨款，“已接近于金钱本身不能再加快速度、加速发展的地步”。因此，美国“新闻周刊”供认，美国目前有关军事政策的争论各方实际上是没有分歧的，“威慑——这正是我们（美国）的根本政策。”这家有势力的杂志发表的另一篇文章，还得意洋洋地说，“令人鼓舞的是，1960年的大辩论差不多击中了这一问题的中心”，即如何“进行艰巨的竞赛来维持”美国的所谓“理所当然的世界地位”。这就是说，在剧烈争吵的背后，“实力政策”的卫士们都在焦急地要求加紧扩军备战，特别是加速发展导弹，以便在最短期间内挽回军事颓势。
    首先，一切吵吵嚷嚷的争论焦点都集中在如何赢得时间，迅速扭转目前美国导弹和探索外层空间方面的落后局面之上。而这正是美国政府玩弄“和平”手段所追求的真实目的之一。美国国防部长盖茨的证词，就公开供认，美国正在对苏联在导弹方面的优势“采取必要的对付措施”，要争取在1962年前后在拥有的导弹数量上“比较接近”苏联。盖茨之流所以提出今后三年内美苏导弹力量对比将不再是一与三之比、认为“导弹差距”将不存在的“新估计”，其根据就在于美国疯狂地推行着在导弹和空间竞赛方面“迎头赶上”苏联的庞大计划。艾森豪威尔在国情咨文和支持盖茨作证的谈话中，也证实了这一点。国情咨文说，美国“必须充分利用时间和技术来试制这些美国以前没有的远程弹道导弹”，并“更广泛地探索外层空间”。艾森豪威尔在1月26日和2月3日记者招待会上先后强调，美国已特别致力于发展洲际导弹，在探索外层空间方面也“不是老是想跟在别人后面”。他还说，“我们应该时刻记住我们国家并没有在沉睡……，我们的确在进行这项工作”。美国全国星际和空间航行局局长格伦南也透露，美国要争取在四、五年内在空间方面赶上并超过苏联。至于在国会内外攻击艾森豪威尔政府的民主党议员约翰逊、薛明顿以及著名评论家李普曼、艾尔索普之流，他们不同意盖茨对导弹力量的估计，不过是认为这种估计不利于迅速缩短“导弹差距”而已。李普曼就说，艾森豪威尔政府所作的在导弹方面“虽然苏联目前超过我们，但我们比苏联走得快”的“假定”，只会妨碍美国取得更大的“速度”。
    其次，美国政府鉴于在洲际导弹方面赶上苏联还须相当时间，因而为了“抵销”这个“差距”，就在拼命发展远程导弹的同时，加紧扩大中程导弹的发展，并把中程导弹用于装备战略空军、潜水艇和地面部队，特别是加强远程战略空军。盖茨的证词就说：“我们正在扩大我们的导弹计划，把导弹放置在轰炸机上，并且把可以发射北极星式导弹的潜水艇编入现役。我们认为这样做能抵销任何所谓导弹差距，至少从我们威慑力量的效能方面看来是如此”。盖茨所以认为“导弹差距”的存在并不等于存在“威慑力量差距”，美国仍保有“全面优势”，根据亦在此。艾森豪威尔的国情咨文也指出，“我们正在顺利地执行的军事导弹计划并不因为我们目前缺乏在远距离空间探索方面非常需要的非常巨大的火箭引擎而受到损害”。美国战略空军司令鲍威尔在竭力煽动所谓来自苏联的“威胁”的同时，更大声叫嚷要用带氢弹头的战略轰炸机日夜进行“空中警戒”以保持“威慑作用”。而大家知道，这种“空中警戒”一直在执行着，严重地威胁着世界和平。鲍威尔还要求增加拨款，进一步加强空军的导弹力量，使“猎狗式导弹帮助我们（美国）攻进苏联去”，以便不致“拉长旨在使我们（美国）在为时尚未晚之前达到这一点”。海陆军将领伯克、布鲁克等人也在作证时要求增加发展各式中程导弹的拨款，以加强潜水艇、航空母舰部队和地面部队。艾森豪威尔政府正在满足这个要求，追加这方面特别是战略空军方面的拨款。据“纽约时报”1月18日的文章透露，在过去五年中，美国政府给各军种的拨款的分配比例是，空军46％—48％，海军和海军陆战队28％，陆军23％—24％，由于进行导弹等新设备，五角大楼的分配使空军的开支不断增加，达到60％。与此同时，美国试验发射这些各种导弹的工作，正在加紧进行中，这早已是公开的秘密了。
    不仅如此，五角大楼的军事首脑在作证时，还提出“全球战略”的计划，要在加强美国的“威慑力量”的同时，加强美国的盟国和军事集团的“防御力量”，扩充美国驻在国外的部队和军事基地，特别是导弹基地。艾森豪威尔在国情咨文中所说的，按照“可以不断加强我国实力的速度进行下去”的“计划”，就包括“采取步骤，在更长远的基础上安排我们给这些盟国的军事援助”，“建立更健全的集体防御体系”。这正是五角大楼军事首脑向国会提出的“全球战略”的具体内容和实际步骤。
    第三、五角大楼军事首脑在作证时，毫不讳言美国疯狂地加紧扩军的目的，是全面备战。1月19日，美国国防部长盖茨在参议院军事委员会作证时，公然标榜美国同时扩大洲际导弹和中程导弹，加强“全面优势”的两个目标是：“首先，通过提供和维持在我们一旦受到任何重大攻击时发动报复的能力来防止大战的爆发；第二、支持美国的外交政策以及提供和维持运用必要的力量来防止和限制局部战争的能力”。谁都知道，美国并没有“受到任何重大攻击”的威胁，所谓“防止大战”，实际上是准备发动世界大战，包括五角大楼将军们一直叫嚣的“先发制人”的大战；所谓“防止和限制局部战争”，实际上就是美国不甘一再遭到失败而仍在着重准备发动“有限战争”也就是局部战争的计划的又一次暴露。盖茨所指的“支持美国的外交政策”，正是说明发动“有限战争”仍然是美国目前侵略计划的重要组成部分。
    第四、在这场争吵中，五角大楼军事首脑和资产阶级御用报刊一致叫嚷着要把准备发动“局部战争”或“有限战争”的矛头，指向远东地区，同时还指向中东地区和拉丁美洲地区。美国参谋长联席会议主席特文宁公然说：“我认为远东受到同宾夕法尼亚州（美国的一个州）同样的保护。它受到战略空军司令部和我们（美国）不管是以那里为基地的其他武器体系的保护。”美国陆军部长布鲁克和陆军参谋长兰尼兹尔的证词透露，美国参谋长联席会议已经拟订了在东南亚进行战争的计划，其中包括干涉老挝和美国太平洋地区总司令拟订的“具体计划”。布鲁克还特别提到他不久前到台湾和其他远东地区的阴谋活动。在这次活动中，他曾公开叫嚣要把美国的侵略范围扩大到金门和马祖，对新中国进行放肆的攻击。美国海军作战参谋长伯克在要求加速发展“北极星”式导弹的潜水艇时，也说美国要准备能够同时“应付两个以上的小冲突，像1958年美国在黎巴嫩和台湾海峡所从事的那样的军事行动”。美国“展望”、“美国新闻与世界报道”等等许多刊物，大肆谈论美国在远东和其他地区的军事部署，鼓吹大大增强在南朝鲜、冲绳、日本、台湾海峡和南亚地区的导弹和陆海空军实力，“准备应变”。如果把这些“局部战争”的叫嚣，同美国最近在远东、中东、加勒比海、巴拿马运河区进行的一系列挑衅性军事演习联系起来看，就可以更清楚地看到美国形形色色的关于和平、缓和局势之类的言论究竟值得几文钱。
    由此可见，美国统治集团内部的这场争吵，固然反映了东风压倒西风的形势使“实力政策”的奉行者在失掉“实力地位”时感到惊慌不安，但更重要的是暴露了美国以侈谈和平来掩饰加紧备战的疯狂挣扎。猛烈攻击艾森豪威尔政府的军事政策的人们，首先是通常在大选年总要发起一番喧闹的民主党政客们。其实他们在加紧备战的任何一个问题上提出的主张，都无一不是艾森豪威尔政府正在竭力从事的计划和步骤。艾森豪威尔2月11日在记者招待会上就说，那些“大事宣扬”和引起“争执”的具体问题，“其中的任何一点都是美国防御中要解决的真正的问题”，而他的政府“已经尽力而为”了。不同的是，艾森豪威尔不赞成大吵大嚷，而要不事声张地干。他在国情咨文中就提出，他不愿在大选年争吵政策问题，他说：“在立法和行政部门之间无关紧要的争吵上花掉的每一分钟，都意味着我们失去一分钟宝贵的时间来明智地制定和执行谋求我们国家的生存和进步的连贯的政策。”究竟此中奥妙何在，中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯说得最坦率。他在去年7月在美国国立军事学院后备军官讨论战略问题的一次讨论会上这样说：
    “我很了解许多人在这方面（美国实力）是有怀疑的，但是我可以肯定告诉你，我们在对付这种挑战（指所谓来自社会主义阵营的挑战）方面比你们所知道的更有准备，配合得更好，做得更有效。但是，过多地谈计划和做法，只会使挑战者对我们的对付措施保持警惕。因此，对批评默不作声比大谈过去的成就或者未来的计划来得好。”
    现在，这场争吵已经由于艾森豪威尔的“恼火”和“遗憾”而平息下去了，但是，这场争吵却已经彻底地暴露了美国在“和平”帷幕后面策划着什么勾当。美国的统治集团不仅在力图重振军事实力的优势，并且图谋在有机可乘之时进行突然的袭击，或者发动“有限战争”。美国国会内的这场争吵，对于全世界一切爱好和平的人民来说，不失为上了生动的一课：对于和平的敌人，必须时刻保持着警惕。
