Collective labor unleashes human talent
    On the Transformation of Housewife Wang Zhiying After Participating in Social Labor
    Tian Denggao
    There is a "March 8th" Restaurant in Harbin. The technical innovations and inventions of this restaurant are praised by everyone. Look! Here, there is "Flying Dishes in the Air," a machine for delivering food, machine-made dumplings, and a knife that cuts vegetables without using hands… What's even more amazing is that dozens of new cooking utensils in this restaurant were created by ordinary housewives. For thousands of years, women toiled in the kitchen at home their entire lives without creating anything. Once they participated in social labor, their talents and wisdom were fully realized. The story of Wang Zhiying's creation of an automatic chopping block is a typical example.
    Two years ago, Wang Zhiying was still a housewife. In her own words, "From dawn till dusk, from the stove to the bed, every day was the same." Wang Zhiying didn't have financial problems, so she was naturally satisfied with this small domestic world. After cooking, washing dishes, and getting the children ready, she would either stand at the door and watch the bustle or visit her neighbors, where the women would gather and chat about domestic matters. However, the tide of social progress impacted this narrow family life. The Great Leap Forward began in 1958, absorbing many housewives into social production. The women who used to spend time with Wang Zhiying all took on new jobs. After work, their conversations and interests were different from Wang Zhiying's. In addition, the numerous political movements in society over the years, as well as the constant propaganda and education on the streets, sowed seeds of progress in Wang Zhiying's heart. She began to feel that her life was too bland. She thought, "I'm only in my twenties, am I going to live like this for the rest of my life? I should contribute to society like they do!" But she also thought, "I can't read, I have two children, and I have household chores. What can I do?" One day, she heard that the service bureau was recruiting odd-job workers, and she thought, "I can definitely do that." Just then, a community service station was established on her street. She sent her two children to the service station's nursery and entrusted some of her housework to the service station. She then signed up to work at the state-owned "March 8th" Restaurant, which had just opened and was run by ten housewives.
    At first, Wang Zhiying washed dishes, picked vegetables, and swept the floor at the restaurant. These tasks were different from what she did at home. There were meetings, political study sessions, and the work was also very demanding. The more Wang Zhiying worked, the more interesting she found it. Because she understood the political significance of her work and deeply understood that the restaurant's service work was also a part of socialist construction. She not only wanted to complete her current tasks better but also yearned to do more and greater work. One day, the restaurant director consulted with her, intending to send her to a chef training class, but considering that she still had a nursing child, they hadn't made a final decision. As soon as Wang Zhiying heard this, she quickly said, "I can arrange my own difficulties and persevere in my studies." After repeated requests, Wang Zhiying was sent to the training class to study.
    Wang Zhiying, who couldn't read, encountered unprecedented difficulties in the training class. She had to memorize everything the teacher said. When she learned about a hundred dishes, she could no longer remember them clearly. She thought, what to do? Now I'm serving the masses, I can't just muddle through like I used to do at home. Finally, she came up with a method: use images to replace words. After three months of hard work, she graduated from the training class with excellent grades and returned to the restaurant as a chef. From then on, she deeply felt that it was impossible to cook for thousands of families without education. The restaurant established a literacy class, and she actively participated in learning. In two months, she got rid of her illiteracy. Later, she studied culture, philosophy, and Chairman Mao's works with everyone, and her enthusiasm grew.
    After the technical innovation movement was launched, Wang Zhiying saw the importance of reforming tools. In the past, when cooking at home, no matter how many dishes there were, it would only take half an hour to cut them all, and she never thought about technical reforms. However, at the restaurant, someone was specifically assigned to cut vegetables all day long, and they were still too busy. A large chopping block, if placed too high, was awkward to use, and if placed too low, it hurt the back. She thought of reforming this clumsy thing first, but she was afraid it wouldn't work. After encouragement from the Party branch, which told her that she had the support of the collective, Wang Zhiying pondered over the chopping block after work, drawing diagrams and making models. After repeated experiments, she finally created a chopping block that could be automatically raised and lowered as needed, which was both lightweight and easy to use, greatly reducing labor intensity and improving work efficiency.
    Wang Zhiying's first shot at reforming tools greatly encouraged all the female workers in the restaurant. The restaurant established a technical innovation group, which created and innovated eighty-seven tools in just over a month, increasing work efficiency by three to twenty times respectively. When the Party branch secretary summarized the experience, he said, "Only by going to social labor can the wisdom of housewives be fully realized. Wang Zhiying is one of them." (Attached photo)
    The Harbin Service Company's Innovative Machinery Factory has successfully trial-produced an automated line consisting of four machines that combine dough mixing, skin pressing, meat filling mixing, and dumpling wrapping, automating the entire dumpling-making process. It can wrap 12,000 dumplings per hour, increasing efficiency by sixteen times compared to manual labor.

    集体劳动发挥了人的才能
    记家庭妇女王之英参加社会劳动前后
    田登高
    哈尔滨市有一个“三八”饭店。这个饭店的技术革新发明创造，受到人人赞扬。你看！这里有机器传送食品的“空中飞菜”，有机器包的饺子，还有不用手来切菜的刀……。更令人惊奇的是，这个饭店出现的几十种新炊具，创造者们以前都是一些普通的家庭妇女。几千年来，妇女在家庭的炉灶前终生劳动都无所创造。一旦参加社会劳动，她们的才能和智慧就得到了充分的发挥。王之英创造自动切菜墩的经过，就是一个典型的例子。
    两年前的王之英，还是一个家庭妇女。用她的话来说：“从早到黑，由锅沿到炕沿，天天如此”。王之英没有生活上的困难，对这种家庭小天地的生活也就自然地满意了。每天做完饭，洗完碗锅，打扮好孩子，剩下的时间，不是站在门口看看热闹，就到邻居那里串门，妇女们聚在一起谈谈家常话。可是社会前进的浪潮，冲击了狭小的家庭生活。1958年开始出现了大跃进，吸收了许多家庭妇女参加社会生产。过去和王之英经常在一起消磨时光的妇女，一个个都走上了新的工作岗位。这些妇女下班后回到家里，她们的谈话和喜爱，都和王之英不一样了。再加上历年来社会上多次的政治运动，街道上的经常宣传和教育，在王之英心上撒下了进步的种子。她开始感到自己的生活太平淡了。她想：“我才二十多岁，就这样活一辈子吗？我应该和她们一样，给社会出一分力气啊！”可是她又想：“我不识字，又有两个孩子，又有家务事，能干个什么呢？”有一天，她听说服务局招收杂工，她想：“我干这个活准行。”恰好这时街道上办起了生活服务站。她把两个孩子送到服务站的托儿站里，一部分家务也交给了服务站，她就报名参加了刚刚开业的、由十个家庭妇女办起来的国营“三八”饭店。
    开始，王之英在饭店里洗碗、摘菜、扫地。这些活和在家里干的可不一样，有会议、政治学习，工作也很紧张，王之英越干越有意思。因为她懂得了自己工作的政治意义，深深地理解了饭店的服务工作，也是社会主义建设的组成部分。她不但想把眼前的工作完成的更好，而且渴望能做更多更大的工作。有一天饭店主任找她商量，打算派她去厨师训练班学习，可是考虑她还有吃奶的孩子，还没有最后做出决定。王之英一听，连忙表示说：“我的困难自己能安排，能坚持学习。”经过再三要求，王之英被派到训练班里学习去了。
    不识字的王之英，在训练班里遇到了从来没有过的困难。老师讲的课，全靠脑子硬记。学到一百种菜的时候，她再也记不清楚了。她想，怎么办，现在是为群众服务，不能像过去在家庭里，什么事对付过去就算。最后她想出了一个办法，用形象代替字。这样经过三个月的努力学习，她以优秀成绩在训练班毕业，回到饭店担任厨师。从此，她又深深地感到，现在为千家万户掌灶，没文化做不好。饭店成立了扫盲识字班，她积极参加学习，两个月就摘掉了文盲帽子。以后，她又跟大家一起学文化，学哲学，学毛主席的著作，劲头越来越大。
    技术革新运动开展起来以后，王之英看到改革工具的重要。过去在家里做饭，菜再多，切半个钟头就完了，从来不想技术改革，可是饭店专门有人整天切菜，还忙不过来。大菜墩子，放到高处切起来不得劲，放到低处，累得腰疼。她想得先改革这个笨东西，可是又怕不行。经过党支部鼓励，告诉她有集体力量在支持她。从此，王之英下班后，就围着菜墩琢磨，又是画图，又是做模型。经过反复试验，终于创造出可以按需要自动升降的菜墩，既轻便又好用，大大减轻了劳动强度，提高了工作效率。
    王之英打响改革工具的第一炮，给饭店全体女职工很大鼓舞。饭店成立了技术革新小组，在一个多月的时间里，创造、革新了八十七件工具，分别提高工作效率三倍到二十倍。党支部书记总结经验的时候说：“只有走向社会劳动，家庭妇女的智慧才能得到充分的发挥，王之英就是其中的一个。”（附图片）
