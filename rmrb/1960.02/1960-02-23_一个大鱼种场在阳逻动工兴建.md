    A Large Fish Farm Under Construction in Yangluo

    In order to adapt to the sustained leap forward in aquatic production and meet the needs of aquaculture, the Huanggang Prefectural Office of Hubei and the Xinzhou County Party Committee are establishing a modern fish fry base—the state-owned Yangluo Fish Farm—in Yangluo, Xinzhou, with more than 2,000 mu of fish ponds. This farm, at present, is still the first large-scale farm in our country. Construction began in mid-to-late January and is expected to be completed in two and a half months.

    Yangluo is a nationally renowned fish fry producing area, producing more than one billion various types of fish fry every year. More than a dozen provinces and cities across the country rely on it for the supply of seedlings. Yangluo is only sixty li away from Wuhan. The site is being built on a large lake beach between Yangluo and Jiebu, close to the Yangtze River in the south, with convenient transportation. To the north is the Chaipo Lake, which covers more than 3,000 mu, which can be used as a rearing lake with some artificial transformation; at the same time, there are more than 200 fishermen households near Yangluo, who have rich experience in fishing for fish fry, making the supply of fish fry convenient.

    The scale of the farm construction is extremely grand. The main construction projects include: a 3,000-meter-long river embankment, 4 meters wide and 4.5 meters high, and a 2,500-meter-long inner lake flood control embankment, 2 meters wide and 3 meters high; self-flowing irrigation channels and drainage ditches totaling more than 40 li in length; an airport; two waterproof sluices; an 800-mu feed base; plus 2,300 mu of 2-meter-deep fish ponds, totaling 750,000 cubic meters of earthwork. In addition, more than 4,000 square meters of farm buildings are to be built, and 100 mu of trees are to be planted. The entire project is scheduled to be completed by the end of March and put into production in April. (Shen Dashu Shi Wuhua)

    一个大鱼种场在阳逻动工兴建
    为了适应水产生产的持续跃进，满足养殖需要，湖北黄冈专署与新洲县委在新洲阳逻建立一个拥有两千多亩鱼池的现代化的鱼种基地——国营阳逻鱼种场。这个场在目前来说，还是我国第一个大场，元月中、下旬，动工兴建，准备两个半月建成。
    阳逻是全国著名的鱼苗产地，每年盛产各类鱼苗十多亿尾，全国有十多个省、市都靠这里供给苗种。阳逻离武汉只有六十里，场址就修建阳逻与界埠之间的一个大湖滩上，南边紧靠长江，交通便利，北边有个三千多亩的柴泊湖，稍加人工改造，就可作为寄养湖；同时，阳逻附近有两百多户渔民，富有丰富的捞捕鱼苗经验，鱼苗供应方便。
    建场规模极为宏大。主要工程项目有：四米宽四米五高，三千米长的江堤和二米宽，三米高，二千五百米长的内湖防洪堤各一条，自流灌溉渠道和注排水沟长达四十余里，飞机场一个，两个防水闸，八百亩饲料基地，加上两米深的鱼池两千三百亩，共计七十五万土方。此外，还要修建场房四千余平方米，植树造林一百亩。全部工程计划三月底竣工，四月份投入生产。　（沈大树　石物华）
