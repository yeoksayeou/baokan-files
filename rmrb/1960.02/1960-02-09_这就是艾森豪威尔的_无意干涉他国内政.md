    This is Eisenhower's "Unintentional Interference in Other Countries' Internal Affairs"
    By People's Daily Commentator

    The secret letter from Cambodian traitor Son Sann to Kellogg, former political counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Cambodia, published by the "Current Status of Cambodia" weekly on February 5, powerfully proves that the United States directly participated in the conspiracy of the Son Sann traitor group, attempting to subvert the legitimate government of Cambodia.

    Everyone knows that Son Sann, who served as Deputy Prime Minister, Prime Minister's Advisor, and Ambassador to the UK, has consistently been pro-American and opposed Cambodia's policy of peace and neutrality. As early as November 1958, with the support of the United States, he secretly founded the "Democratic People's News," openly attacking Cambodia's policy of peace and neutrality and Sihanouk. At the same time, he secretly plotted with the U.S., Thai, and South Vietnamese authorities to subvert the current government of Cambodia. After the Son Sann group's treasonous conspiracy was uncovered on January 20 last year, Son Sann fled to Saigon and colluded with another Cambodian traitor, Son Ngoc Thanh, continuing to plot new subversion conspiracies with advisors from Southeast Asian aggression groups. On the one hand, they established the so-called "Free Khmer Committee," organizing "Free Khmer armies" in Thailand and South Vietnam, preparing for armed attacks; on the other hand, they recruited bandits within Cambodia, gathered intelligence, and created chaos through assassinations and kidnappings as internal support for subverting the Kingdom of Cambodia's government.

    The supporter and instigator behind the Son Sann group is U.S. imperialism, as many previously revealed materials have fully proven. The United States has always reversed right and wrong and made all kinds of sophistry in the past, but now it cannot deny it in any way. A handwritten letter from Son Sann has completely exposed the relationship between them. Please note that at the beginning of this secret letter, Son Sann referred to the conspiracy to subvert the current Cambodian government as a "matter of common concern" for the United States and Cambodian traitors. The letter clearly mentions the palace bomb explosion conspiracy to assassinate the King of Cambodia that they planned on August 31 last year. It shows that U.S. diplomats in Cambodia were not only involved; after the conspiracy suffered a setback, they were prepared to "take the most effective measures" to achieve their "common goal."

    The U.S. State Department actually dared to assure the Kingdom of Cambodia's government that its ambassador was "completely unaware" of these subversive conspiracies. However, Son Sann's letter clearly states the traitor group's reporting and requesting instructions from its U.S. masters. Please note that Son Sann expressed "great hope" that the U.S. diplomat would "discuss in detail" "their future plans"; and believed that the U.S. diplomat's "letter" gave him "new hope." He not only "fully agreed" with "His Excellency Ambassador Trumbull's opinion," but also "counted on his assistance and cooperation." Encouraged by the United States, Son Sann even proposed "accelerating activities" so that the "moment desired" by the United States and this Cambodian traitor group would "arrive as soon as possible." What kind of moment they desired is self-evident: overthrowing the legitimate government of Cambodia, changing its neutral policy, and making Cambodia an unreserved appendage of the United States.

    The United States' opposition to the Sihanouk government, which pursues a policy of peace and neutrality, has long been well known. Everyone remembers that since the restoration of peace in Indochina, the Cambodian government has increasingly firmly pursued a policy of peace and neutrality of not participating in any military blocs and developing friendly relations with all countries. This has aroused great dissatisfaction from the United States, which has attempted to dominate the entire Indochina. In order to force Cambodia to abandon its policy of peace and neutrality and join the Southeast Asian military bloc, the United States has tried every means to exert pressure on Cambodia over the years. From using "U.S. aid" as a means to threaten and entice Cambodia, to instigating Thailand and South Vietnam, under its control, to create difficulties and unrest for Cambodia by blocking borders, armed provocations, and inciting border disputes. When all these conspiracies failed due to strong resistance from the Cambodian government and people, the United States began to change its strategy and adopt more covert and more sinister means to buy over and win over pro-American elements in Cambodia, creating a cabinet crisis, attempting to subvert the Sihanouk government from within. When this goal also failed to be achieved, the United States continued to direct Thailand and South Vietnam to provoke Cambodia, while stepping up efforts to use pro-American elements in Cambodia and traitors who had fled abroad to organize armed forces, attempting to overthrow the Sihanouk government by force through internal and external cooperation. The two treason cases of Son Sann and Chong Mochupich, which were successively uncovered and suppressed by the Cambodian government in January and February last year, are the products of the United States' long-term planning to subvert Cambodia.

    It can be seen that the United States has consistently conspired to subvert the Cambodian government, which adheres to a policy of peace and neutrality. It either takes this approach or that approach. In short, there is only one purpose, and that is to make Cambodia completely obey the United States. Son Sann's secret letter further exposes that the United States' ambition to continue plotting to subvert the Cambodian government and dominate the entire Indochina has not changed in the slightest.

    Recently, in order to strengthen its "peaceful" posture, U.S. imperialism has constantly expressed that it respects the independence of all countries and has no intention of infringing upon the sovereignty of other countries. In his State of the Union Address this year, U.S. President Eisenhower emphasized that "the United States has no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of any country; similarly, we oppose any attempt to impose its system on us or the people of other countries by force and subversion." But as long as these words are compared with Son Sann's secret letter to the U.S. diplomat, it is not difficult to see how hypocritical they are. It is U.S. imperialism itself that interferes in the internal affairs of other countries and attempts to impose the U.S. system on other countries through subversive activities. It can be seen that the United States' "peace" rhetoric is merely a decoration for its aggressive activities.

    这就是艾森豪威尔的“无意干涉他国内政”
    本报评论员
    “柬埔寨现状”周刊在2月5日公布的柬埔寨叛国分子桑·萨里给美国驻柬埔寨大使馆前政务参赞凯洛格的密信，有力地证明了美国直接参与桑·萨里叛国集团的阴谋，企图颠覆柬埔寨的合法政府。
    谁都知道，曾担任过柬埔寨副首相、首相顾问和驻英大使的桑·萨里一贯亲美，反对柬埔寨执行和平中立政策。早从1958年11月开始，他就在美国支持下隐名创办“民主人民报”，公开攻击柬埔寨的和平中立政策和西哈努克。与此同时，他还偷偷地同美国、泰国和南越当局策划颠覆柬埔寨现政府的阴谋。去年1月20日，桑·萨里集团的叛国阴谋被破获后，桑·萨里逃到西贡，和柬埔寨另一个叛国分子山玉成勾结在一起，同东南亚侵略集团的顾问继续策划新的颠覆阴谋。他们一方面成立所谓“自由高棉委员会”，在泰国和南越分别组织“自由高棉军队”，准备武装进攻；一方面在柬埔寨国内收罗匪徒，刺探情报，用暗杀、绑架等活动制造混乱，作为颠覆柬埔寨王国政府的内应。
    桑·萨里集团背后的支持者和指使者是美帝国主义，以往揭露出来的许多材料已充分证明这一点。美国过去一直颠倒是非、百般狡辩，但现在却无论如何也抵赖不掉了。桑·萨里的一封亲笔信已经把他们之间的关系完全暴露出来了。请看，桑·萨里在这封密信里，一开头就把颠覆柬埔寨现政府的阴谋称之为美国和柬埔寨叛国分子“共同关心的问题”。信中明白提到他们在去年8月31日策划的谋害柬埔寨国王的宫廷炸弹爆炸阴谋。它说明美国驻柬埔寨的外交官不仅是参与其事的；他们在阴谋遭受失败后，还准备“采取最有效的措施”来达到他们的“共同目的”。
    美国国务院居然敢向柬埔寨王国政府保证它的大使对于这些颠覆阴谋“毫不知情”。但是，桑·萨里的信上却把这个叛国集团对美国主子的汇报、请示关系写得清清楚楚。请看，桑·萨里表示“非常希望”美国外交官“全面来谈谈”“他们将来的计划”；认为美国外交官的“来信”使他“产生了新的希望”。他不仅“完全同意”“美国大使阁下特林布尔的意见”，而且“指望着他的援助和合作”。桑·萨里在美国的鼓励下，甚至提出“加速进行活动”，以便使美国和这个柬埔寨叛国集团“所渴望的时刻尽快到来”。他们所渴望的时刻是什么样的时刻，这是不言自明的，那就是推翻柬埔寨的合法政府、改变它的中立政策，使柬埔寨不折不扣地成为美国的附庸国。
    美国反对执行和平中立政策的西哈努克政府，是人们久已熟知的事情了。大家还记得，自从印度支那和平恢复以来，柬埔寨政府日益坚定地奉行不参加任何军事集团、同一切国家发展友好关系的和平中立政策以后，就引起了妄图霸占整个印度支那的美国的极大不满。为了迫使柬埔寨放弃和平中立政策、参加东南亚军事集团，几年来，美国曾想尽办法对柬埔寨施加压力。从以“美援”为手段对柬埔寨进行威胁利诱，直到唆使在它控制下的泰国和南越以封锁边境、武装挑衅、挑起边境纠纷等办法给柬埔寨制造困难和不安。当这一切阴谋都因遭到柬埔寨政府和人民的强烈反抗而归于失败时，美国就开始改变策略，采取更隐蔽和更毒辣的手段，对柬埔寨国内的亲美分子进行收买和拉拢，制造内阁危机，企图从内部来颠覆西哈努克政府。当这一目的也未能达到时，美国就一方面继续指使泰国和南越向柬埔寨挑衅，一方面加紧利用柬埔寨国内亲美分子和逃亡在外的叛国分子组织武装力量，企图里应外合地以武力推翻西哈努克政府。去年1、2月间先后为柬埔寨政府所破获和镇压的桑·萨里和琼·莫舒皮两起叛国案，就是美国长期以来策划颠覆柬埔寨的产物。
    由此可见，美国过去一贯阴谋颠覆坚持和平中立政策的柬埔寨政府。不是采取这种手法，就是采取那种手法。总而言之，目的只有一个，这就是要柬埔寨完全听命于美国。桑·萨里的这封密信，更进一步暴露了美国继续策划它颠覆柬埔寨政府和霸占整个印度支那的野心毫无改变。
    最近一个时期以来，美帝国主义为了加强它的“和平”姿态，不断表示它是尊重各国独立，而无意侵犯他国主权的。美国总统艾森豪威尔在今年的国情咨文中就强调说，“美国无意干涉任何国家的内政；同样我们反对任何企图用武力和颠覆活动把它的制度强加于我们或其他国家人民的尝试”。但只要把这些话同桑·萨里写给美国外交官的密信对照一下，就不难识破它是多么的虚伪。干涉他国内政，企图用颠覆活动把美国的制度强加于他国的，正是美帝国主义自己。可见美国的“和平”言论不过是它的侵略活动的装饰品而已。
