    Learning from the Methods of Chinese Metallurgical Workers
    Danilin, Layout Worker, Bezhitsa Steel Foundry, USSR

    The Bezhitsa steelworkers have successfully applied the three-tap method of steelmaking learned from the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company. Facts prove just how much benefit this new method has brought. In 1958, open-hearth furnace workers at our factory overproduced by several thousand tons of steel. We started using the methods of our Chinese friends on one furnace in the second half of 1958. Now, the three-tap method has been adopted on two furnaces.

    Not long ago, a continuous (horizontal) ingot casting machine designed by engineer Gordobin was put into production in the open-hearth furnace workshop. It has changed the working conditions of steelworkers. The workshop is more spacious and cleaner because there are no more ingot molds. Previously, steel ingots cast using ingot molds were only a little over one meter long. Now, the ingot casting machine can cast ingots nine meters long. This machine greatly interested the delegation of British metallurgical workers who visited the factory, because they do not yet have such a machine. I think that the Chinese metallurgical workers, who have proposed catching up with and surpassing Britain in industrial products, will also be interested in the new Soviet machine.

    Currently, the staff of our factory is striving to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Worker Babochkin has decided to complete his Seven-Year Plan in four years. Judging from his work, the time to complete the plan can be further shortened. He overfulfills his task by more than double every month.

    Bondarev came to the foundry workshop after retiring from the Soviet Army. In the army, he was a political worker who participated in many battles against the fascist bandits. Now, Comrade Bondarev leads the workshop's excellent molding team. This team overproduces two hundred vehicle undercarriages per month above the plan.

    While successfully building communism, we eagerly hope that our friends and comrades-in-arms—the Chinese workers—will achieve even greater labor achievements.

    学习中国冶金工人的方法
    苏联别日察铸钢厂划线工　达尼林
    别日察钢铁工人顺利地运用了向太原钢铁公司学来的三槽出钢法。这种新方法究竟带来了多少好处，有事实为证。1958年，我厂马丁炉工人超额生产了几千吨钢。我们是在1958年下半年开始在一座炉子上采用中国朋友的方法。而现在，已经在两座炉子上采用了三槽出钢法。
    不久以前，马丁炉车间有一台由工程师戈尔多宾设计的连续（卧式的）铸锭机投入生产。它改变了炼钢工人的劳动条件。车间里没有了铸锭模，因而更宽敞、清洁。以前使用铸锭模铸出的钢锭只有一米多长。现在铸锭机能铸出九米长的钢锭。这台机器使来厂参观的英国冶金工作者代表团很感兴趣。因为他们还没有这样的机器。我想，提出在工业产品方面赶上和超过英国的中国冶金工人也会对苏联的新机器发生兴趣。
    目前，我们工厂的职工正在为提前完成七年计划而奋斗。工人巴包契金决定用四年的时间完成自己的七年计划。从他的工作情况来看，完成计划的时间还能缩短。他每月都超额一倍多完成任务。
    邦达列夫是从苏军退伍以后来到翻砂车间的。在军队中他曾是政治工作人员，多次参加了同法西斯强盗的战斗。现在邦达列夫同志领导着车间的优秀造型工生产队。这个队每月超计划生产二百个车辆底架。
    我们在顺利建设共产主义的同时，热切地希望我们的朋友和战友——中国工人获得更大的劳动成就。
