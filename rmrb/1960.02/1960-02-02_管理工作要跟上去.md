    Management Work Must Keep Up
    The Chinese Communist Party Shenyang Smelting Plant Committee
    After learning and promoting the experience of the Anshan Iron and Steel Third Steel Plant's technical performance competition, the workers took the lead, everyone performed, every team performed, and quickly formed a new high tide of production. Under this new situation of production leap forward, the contradiction that enterprise management work could not keep up with the rapid development of production was exposed. Based on this situation, while grasping production vigorously, we also grasped management work vigorously. On the basis of the original business competition carried out by the departments, according to the nine professional systems, the three links of departments, workshop functional groups, and worker administrators were strung into nine lines respectively, and the "one line connects three links" business competition was widely carried out. Subsequently, we twisted the nine lines into one rope and developed it into a "nine lines, one rope" joint competition, that is, the enterprise management three-way combination of large-scale collaboration competition. Because we adopted the method of large-scale mass movement in management work, a new situation of combining the upper and lower levels, mutual cooperation, continuous improvement of business, and facing production everywhere was formed, which greatly improved the level of enterprise management.
    Grasp Management Work Vigorously
    Carry Out Large-Scale Mass Movement
    The "Nine Lines, One Rope" competition was developed on the basis of the "One Line Connects Three Links" business competition. The "One Line Connects Three Links" business competition is to string the three links of departments, workshop functional groups, and worker administrators into one line according to each professional system. Each line is vertically aligned, and according to the requirements and tasks of each professional system to improve management and promote production, the three links have a clear division of labor, mutual guarantee, and carry out competition. "Nine Lines" refers to the nine business systems of the plant's production technology, technical inspection, safety and health, equipment maintenance, material supply, accounting, personnel wages, chemical analysis, and statistical records, which run through from the department to the worker administrator. It embodies the vertical competition relationship between departments, workshop functional groups, and worker administrators. The "One Rope" is to organize the "Nine Lines," propose unified goals according to the requirements of improving production and strengthening management in different periods, and realize common goals with one heart and one mind. It embodies the horizontal competition relationship between the various lines. Therefore, the content of the "Nine Lines, One Rope" competition is centered on comprehensively improving the level of management and promoting a comprehensive leap forward in production. Its most important feature is that it enables the competition of professional management personnel to jump out of the small circle of department competition and combine with mass management. The upper and lower levels are closely combined, cooperate with each other, unify goals, and act consistently, so that the plant's management work competition forms a whole with vertical and horizontal intersections.
    How did we string the three links into one line, and how did we twist the nine lines into one rope?
    The main method of connecting the three links in one line is to clarify the division of labor at each level, and each level makes demands and guarantees to each other. Taking the accounting line as an example, the main competition goal in November last year was: to achieve the goal of reducing costs by 800,000 yuan through widely carrying out team accounting, improving metal recovery rate, increasing output, and processing low-priced raw materials. In order to ensure the completion of this task, the accounting department's conditions were to have indicators, analysis, and direction when distributing cost reduction tasks to each workshop, and to go deep into the workshop to help research and formulate cost reduction measures, and assist the workshop groups to carry out team accounting. The workshop guaranteed to fully mobilize the masses, overfulfill the output task, break through various technical and economic norms, ensure the completion of the November cost indicators, carry out mass team accounting, and conduct economic activity analysis reports to employees on a ten-day basis to ensure the completion of the workshop cost reduction indicators. The group guaranteed to complete the output and economic quotas, carry out team accounting, achieve indicators, accounting, forms, and analysis, and each worker accountant would be able to manage, calculate, and analyze, and guarantee the completion of the group's savings indicators. After the three links of this line clarified their tasks, the accounting department convened a meeting of the workshop and group accountants to announce the competition conditions and start the competition. In this way, the three links of the accounting system are strung into one line. Through the upper and lower levels combining to carry out competition, 90% of the groups in the plant have now implemented team accounting. Of the 110 economic and technical quotas, only 50% could be completed in September before the competition, but 80.6% were completed in November, and the cost of the entire plant was reduced by 1.12 million yuan compared to the plan.
    Twisting the nine lines into one rope is mainly achieved through thematic meetings, competition and rivalry meetings, and organizing large-scale collaboration among the lines. Taking accounting as an example again. In order to prepare cost statements in advance for leaders to analyze economic activities in a timely manner, in addition to the accounting line providing original data to the accounting department from bottom to top in advance, the wage, material, product testing, and statistical lines must also provide the required statistical data in advance. At this time, the plant administration and trade union convened a meeting of professional management personnel from all departments to study this issue. Competition and rivalry meetings were also held between the various lines to ensure that the accounting department's requirements were met in a timely manner. After the concerted efforts of the relevant lines, many advanced working methods were created, such as the "numerical data first rapid statistics method," "advance inventory, accurate goods and accounts material management method," and "wage attendance flow audit method," which finally enabled the cost statement to be submitted five days in advance. In solving major production problems, the nine lines are generally twisted into one rope through the organization of large-scale collaboration. For example, the workers of the copper smelting workshop, after being educated by the general line, proposed the ambitious plan to break through the 150-ton mark for daily output. In order to enable each line to cooperate with this workshop to realize this plan, we convened a competition and rivalry conference for each line, requiring the immediate launch of a joint competition for large-scale collaboration of each line to serve production. As a result, each line took the initiative to go deep into the workshops and groups to solicit opinions and understand needs, and the relevant lines also convened professional meetings for research. As a result, the production technology department quickly helped the workshop realize the technical innovation of "hanging the furnace," which allowed the furnace to be repaired after more than twenty more furnaces. The transportation department overcame the difficulties of winter transportation and ensured the supply of coke. The supply department tried every means to ensure the supply of raw materials. The mechanical and electrical department sent special personnel to assist in the maintenance and repair of equipment. The safety technology department also sent special personnel to strengthen the inspection of various production safety aspects. After the strong cooperation of each line, the departments, workshops, and workers were twisted into one rope, and finally a maximum record of 181 tons of copper per day was created, laying a favorable foundation for increasing the production of 1,000 tons of electrolytic copper in December. When solving some thematic issues with a wide range of implications, we also used the form of a "work team," with one line as the main focus, absorbing a certain link of the relevant departments, workshops, or groups to participate in joint research and resolution.
    Facing Production Everywhere
    Putting Politics in Command in Everything
    Although the competition has not been carried out for a long time, it has shown a huge effect on improving the level of enterprise management. The main manifestations are:
    1. Management personnel have changed their ideas and styles of not asking about politics and not going deep into reality. For example, production dispatchers, they buried themselves in the dispatch of production figures, only paid attention to the adjustment of material conditions, and relied on telephone orders to carry out their work. This kind of thinking and style of not engaging in mass movements, not asking about central movements, and not going deep into production reality existed to varying degrees in each professional system. After the competition was carried out, they understood the importance of putting politics in command, that economic work must be combined with political work, and clarified the direction of carrying out large-scale mass movements in management work. Therefore, their work style has changed. For example, production dispatchers, in addition to doing their own work well, when good people and good deeds that break through key points appeared in the workshop, they used various forms such as congratulatory letters, fast board poems, and big-character posters to carry out publicity and encouragement, which effectively boosted the workers' enthusiasm for production. When they discovered the key and weak links in production, they promptly proposed them to the workers in the form of big-character posters, so that the masses could take measures in a timely manner to carry out competition and overcome key points. This makes the dispatch work based on a solid mass foundation and guarantees the completion of the dispatch task.
    2. Because worker administrators have increased their enthusiasm for participating in enterprise management, and professional management personnel have gone deep into production reality and actively obtained the support and help of workers, professional personnel and worker administrators have strengthened the work in weak links and improved management methods in the competition. In the one-month period of carrying out the competition, more than 300 pieces of advanced experience in reforming business and improving rules and regulations have emerged, of which 13 major sets and 130 minor sets have been incorporated into the system. This has effectively improved the work efficiency of department personnel, so that 48 kinds of reports from the entire plant can be reported two to four days in advance of the time stipulated by the state, and the cost report created the latest record of being submitted on the 1st of the following month, which has played a positive role in guiding the movement and production of leaders at all levels.
    3. It has enabled department management personnel to find concrete methods for implementing the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" system. When implementing the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" system last year, it was stipulated that technical personnel should participate in physical labor for half a day a week, but because the business had not been well reformed, only one-third of the people were able to persist. The phenomenon of department personnel being divorced from production reality and the masses was even more common. Some statisticians have been counting finished and semi-finished products such as sintered blocks for several years, but they do not know what sintered blocks look like. Some technicians only know the oxidation and reduction effects of blast furnaces, but they do not know how large the oxidation and reduction capacity of our plant's blast furnace is, so they can only start from subjective imagination when formulating ingredients. There are many similar examples. Due to the large-scale mass movement in management work, giving full play to the role of workers in participating in management, reforming management business, liberating department personnel from complicated business, and making it possible to go deep into workshops and groups (sections) for three hours every day, handle business for five hours, and labor for four hours every week. Through labor and going deep into reality, they have realized the inadequacy of their own knowledge, and thus admire the richness of workers' production knowledge and admire the workers' enthusiasm for labor, and fundamental changes have taken place in their thinking and feelings. An accounting clerk who used to think that he was an "iron calculator" found thirteen wrong accounts after going deep into the work section to check the accounts after the competition was carried out. He checked his style of being a "bookkeeper" who was divorced from reality and realized that he could not do a good job if he only cared about the correctness of the accounts without going deep into understanding the reality. Facts show that carrying out this competition has also created favorable conditions for technical personnel to be both red and expert.
    4. It has guaranteed the comprehensive completion of production tasks in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. Since the competition was carried out, management work has been improved, and the effect on production is also significant. The total industrial output value increased by 8.5% in October compared to September, and increased by 10.3% in November compared to the plan, and cumulatively completed 104% of the annual plan, stepping into 1960 forty-one days in advance. The passive situation of failing to complete the cost task was completely reversed. The cost was reduced by more than 840,000 yuan compared to the plan in October, and was reduced by 1.12 million yuan compared to the plan in November, and was reduced by 640,000 yuan in December. The labor productivity increased by 5.89% compared to the plan in October, and increased by 11.06% compared to the plan in November, and increased by 5% in December. The output and quality of 22 of the 23 products all exceeded the indicators stipulated by the national plan. 110 major technical and economic quotas could only be completed 50% in September, 71.3% were completed in October, and 80.6% were completed in November. The capital turnover period in October was accelerated by 20 days compared to the plan, and was accelerated by 25 days compared to the plan in November, and the production, technology, and financial plans were comprehensively completed. The entire plant completed the annual production, technology, and financial plans seven days in advance. A good start was achieved in 1960, maintaining a daily red, and the total industrial output value in January increased by 6.7% compared to December 1959, and labor productivity increased by 6.93%.
    Strengthen the Party's Political and Specific Leadership
    Give Play to the Role of Administration, Trade Union, and the Communist Youth League
    Our main experience in carrying out the "Nine Lines, One Rope" competition in management work is, first of all, to strengthen the Party's leadership and adhere to the policy of putting politics in command and carrying out large-scale mass movements. In the past, for a considerable period of time, due to some unreasonable management methods, ignoring the Party's leadership, not wanting the mass line, and restricting the masses' enthusiasm for production, the contradiction that management work lagged behind the masses' production movement continued to expand. After implementing the system of the plant director being responsible under the leadership of the Party committee and implementing the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" system, management work has been greatly improved and improved. In learning and promoting the experience of the Anshan Iron and Steel Third Steel Plant's technical performance competition, the Party committee strengthened leadership and carried out large-scale mass movements, which created the experience of the enterprise management three-way combination of large-scale collaboration competition. Facts have proved that through this method of carrying out large-scale mass movements, the situation of enterprise management work lagging behind production development has been rapidly changed.
    Secondly, while strengthening the Party's specific leadership, give full play to the role of administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations at all levels. In the competition, the Party committee constantly analyzed the situation, grasped the laws of the movement, strengthened the political and ideological leadership of management personnel, and promptly pointed out the key points of production and the direction of the competition, so that the movement could develop healthily. The administrative leadership fully played the role of the departments, promptly arranged work, clarified key points, put forward specific directions for improving enterprise management, and often checked and urged, solved specific problems in the competition, and strengthened the organizational leadership of the competition with the trade union. The trade union mainly did a good job in organizing the competition and evaluation work, especially constantly based on the problems in production and management, mobilized the various professional systems to do a good job in large-scale collaboration, twisted the various links into one rope, and promptly carried out large-scale evaluations, large-scale exchanges, set up pacesetters, planted red flags, mass movements and reward work. The Communist Youth League organized and mobilized the vast number of league members and young people to actively participate in the competition, reform business, learn advanced experience, and cooperate with the trade union to use various literary and artistic forms to publicize new people and new things, and stimulate the enthusiasm of workers and masses to participate in the competition.
    Thirdly, in carrying out this competition, in addition to firmly grasping the cadres participating in labor, going deep into production, and leading production, it is also necessary to grasp the link of workers participating in management. Because all management work must be finally implemented through workers, and all the basis of management work comes from production practice and the hands of workers. Therefore, only by making workers truly both producers and managers can enterprise management have a solid and reliable mass base. The management work of our plant has been rapidly improved and improved under the direct participation and active support of the workers. The key to strengthening the participation of workers in management lies on the one hand in fully mobilizing and organizing professional management personnel to go deep into the workshop teams to specifically help and guide worker administrators to familiarize themselves with business and carry out work, so that professional management and mass management are closely combined. On the other hand, the Party branch must also strengthen specific leadership, give play to the core role of the Party group, constantly educate workers to improve their sense of responsibility as masters, continuously improve and consolidate the organization of workers' participation in management, and promptly guide, check, and supervise the work of worker administrators.

    管理工作要跟上去
    中共沈阳冶炼厂委员会
    我们在学习推广鞍钢第三炼钢厂技术表演赛的经验之后，工人群众一马当先，人人表演，班班表演，迅速地形成了一个新的生产高潮。在这种生产跃进的新形势下，暴露了企业管理工作赶不上生产迅速发展的矛盾。根据这一情况，我们在大抓生产的同时，大抓管理工作。在原来开展的科室同业务竞赛的基础上，按照九个专业系统，把科室、车间职能组、工人管理员这三个环节，分别串成九条线，广泛开展了“一线串三环”的同业务竞赛。接着，我们又把九条线拧成一根绳，发展成“九条线、一根绳”的联合竞赛，也就是企业管理三结合大协作竞赛。由于在管理工作上采取了大搞群众运动的方法，形成了上下结合，互相协作、不断改进业务、处处面向生产的新局面，大大提高了企业管理水平。
    大抓管理工作
    大搞群众运动
    “九条线、一根绳”竞赛，是在“一线串三环”同业务竞赛的基础上发展起来的。“一线串三环”同业务竞赛，是按各个专业系统分别把科室、车间职能组和工人管理员这三个环节串成一条线，每条线上下对口，根据各自专业系统改进管理促进生产的要求和任务，三环之间，明确分工，互相保证，开展竞赛。“九条线”就是指全厂生产技术、技术检查、安全卫生、设备维护、材料供应、会计核算、人事工资、化验分析、统计记录等九个业务系统，从科室到工人管理员贯串起来。它体现着科室、车间职能组和工人管理员之间纵的竞赛关系。而“一根绳”则是把“九条线”组织起来，根据不同时期提高生产和加强管理的要求，提出统一目标，同心合力地实现共同目标，它体现着各个线之间横的竞赛关系。因此，“九条线、一根绳”竞赛的内容，是以全面提高管理水平，促进生产全面跃进为中心的。它最主要的特点是：使专业管理人员的竞赛跳出了科室竞赛的小圈子，和群众管理结合起来，上下之间紧密结合，互相之间通力协作，目标统一，行动一致，使全厂管理工作竞赛纵横交错形成一个整体。
    我们是怎样把三环串成一条线，怎样把九条线拧成一根绳的呢？
    一线串三环的主要方法是，三环之间逐级明确分工，各级之间彼此提要求，互相提保证。以会计核算这一条线为例，去年11月份主要竞赛目标是：通过广泛开展班组核算，提高金属回收率、增加产量、处理低价原料等办法，实现降低成本八十万元的指标。为了保证完成这一任务，会计科的条件是向各车间分配降低成本任务时，做到有指标、有分析、有方向，并深入车间帮助研究和制订降低成本的措施，协助车间小组开展班组核算。车间则保证作到充分发动群众，超额完成产量任务，突破各项技术经济定额，确保完成11月份的成本指标，开展群众性的班组核算，按旬向职工进行经济活动分析报告，保证完成车间降低成本指标。小组保证完成产量和经济定额，开展班组核算，作到有指标、有核算、有形式、有分析，每个工人核算员作到会管、会算、会分析，保证完成小组节约指标。这一条线的三个环节明确任务后，会计科就召集车间、小组的会计核算员开会，宣布竞赛条件，开展竞赛。这样，会计核算系统的三个环节就串成一条线。通过上下结合开展竞赛，全厂目前已有90％的小组实行了班组核算。一百一十项经济技术定额，在开展竞赛之前，9月份只能完成50％，11月份完成了80．6％，全厂成本比计划降低了一百一十二万元。
    九条线拧成一根绳，主要是通过专题性会议，比武叫劲会、组织各线大协作实现的。仍以会计核算为例。会计科为了提前编制成本报表，供领导及时分析经济活动，这除了会计核算这条线要自下而上地提前供给会计科原始资料以外，还必须工资、材料、产品化验、统计等各条线都要提前供给它所需要的统计资料。这时厂行政、工会就召开全厂各科专业管理人员会议，专题研究这一问题；各个线之间也召开比武叫劲会，保证及时满足会计科要求。经过有关各条线一致努力，创造了许多像“数字先行快速统计法”，“提前清点、货清账准材料管理法”、“工资考勤流水审核法”等等先进工作方法，终于使成本报表提前五天报出。在解决重大生产问题上，一般是通过组织大协作把九条线拧成一根绳的。例如铜冶炼车间的工人群众，经过总路线的教育，提出突破日产一百五十吨大关的雄伟计划。我们为使各条线配合这个车间实现这个计划，就召集各线开了比武叫劲大会，要求立即展开一个为生产服务的各线大协作的联合竞赛。于是各线都纷纷主动深入车间、小组征求意见，了解需要，有关各线并召开了专业会议，进行研究。结果，生产技术科很快帮助车间实现了“挂炉”的技术革新，使炉子可以再延长二十多炉后检修；运输科冲破了冬季运输的困难，保证了焦炭的供应；供应科千方百计保证了原材料的供应；机动科派专人负责协助作好设备的维护检修；安全技术科也派专人加强了各项生产安全的检查。经过各线的有力配合，科室、车间和工人拧成一根绳，终于创造了日产铜一百八十一吨的最高纪录，为12月份增产一千吨电铜打下了有利基础。在解决一些专题性涉及面较广的问题时，我们还运用了“工作队”的形式，以一条线为主，吸收有关几条线的科室、车间或小组的某一环节参加，共同研究解决。
    处处面向生产
    事事政治挂帅
    竞赛开展时间虽然不长，但对提高企业管理水平方面，显示了巨大的作用。主要表现在：
    一、管理人员改变了不问政治、不深入实际的思想和作风。例如生产调度员，他们埋头于生产数字的调度，只重物质条件的调剂，依靠电话发令进行工作。像这种不搞群众运动、不问中心运动、不深入生产实际的思想作风，在各专业系统都不同程度地存在着。开展竞赛后，他们懂得了政治挂帅的重要意义，经济工作必须与政治工作相结合，明确了在管理工作中大搞群众运动的方向。因此，他们的工作方式改变了。如生产调度员，他们除作好本身业务以外，车间出现了突破关键的好人好事，就及时用贺信、快板诗、大字报等多种形式，进行宣传鼓动，有力地鼓舞了职工的生产热情；发现了生产中的关键和薄弱环节，就及时用大字报向职工提出，便于群众及时采取措施，开展竞赛，攻克关键。这样就使调度工作建立在坚固的群众基础之上，保证了调度任务的完成。
    二、由于工人管理员提高参加企业管理的积极性，专业管理人员深入生产实际、主动取得工人的支持和帮助，因此，在竞赛中，专业人员与工人管理员一道，加强了薄弱环节的工作，改进了管理工作方法。在开展竞赛的一个多月中，就出现革新业务、改进规章制度的先进经验三百多件，其中纳入制度的有十三大套、一百三十小套。这就有效地提高了科室人员的工作效率，使全厂四十八种表报按国家规定时间提前两天到四天报出，成本表报创造了下月1日提出的最新纪录，对各级领导指导运动和生产，起到了积极作用。
    三、使科室管理人员找到了贯彻执行“两参一改三结合”制度的具体方法。在去年贯彻“两参一改三结合”的制度时，曾规定技职人员每周参加体力劳动半天，但因为业务没有很好改革，只有三分之一的人能够坚持。科室人员脱离生产实际、脱离群众的现象更为普遍。有些统计员，统计了几年的烧结块等成品半成品，但他们却不知道烧结块是什么样的。有些技术员只知道鼓风炉的氧化、还原作用，却不知道我厂的鼓风炉的氧化、还原能力多大，他们配料就只能是从主观想像出发。类似的事例很多。由于在管理工作中大搞群众运动，充分发挥工人参加管理的作用，革新管理业务，把科室人员从繁杂的业务中解放出来，作到每天深入车间、小组（工段）三小时，处理业务五小时，每周劳动四小时。通过劳动和深入实际，使他们认识到自己知识的不足，从而佩服工人生产知识的丰富，钦佩工人的劳动热情，在思想感情上发生了根本变化。一个材料会计员，过去一直觉得自己是“铁算盘”，但在开展竞赛以后，深入工段核对账目，发现也有十三笔错账。他检查了自己的脱离实际的“账房先生”的作风，认识到只管账面不错而不深入了解实际的作法是作不好工作的。事实表明，开展这一竞赛，也给技职人员作到又红又专创造了有利条件。
    四、保证了多快好省地全面完成生产任务。开展竞赛以来，管理工作改进了，反映在生产上的效果也是显著的。工业总产值10月份比9月份提高8．5％，11月份又比计划提高了10．3％，累计完成年计划的104％，提前四十一天跨进1960年；彻底扭转了完不成成本任务的被动局面，10月份比计划降低八十四万多元，11月份又比计划降低一百一十二万元；12月份又降低了六十四万元；劳动生产率10月份比计划提高5．89％，11月份比计划提高11．06％；12月份又提高5％；二十三种产品中二十二种产品的产量、质量全部超过国家计划规定的指标；一百一十项主要技术经济定额，9月份只能完成50％，10月份完成了71．3％，11月份完成了80．6％；10月份资金周转期比计划加速二十天，11月份比计划加速二十五天，全面完成了生产、技术、财务计划。全厂提前七天完成了全年生产、技术、财务计划。1960年实现了开门红，保持了日日红，1月份工业总产值比1959年12月份又提高6．7％；劳动生产率提高6．93％。
    加强党的政治和具体领导
    发挥行政、工会、团的作用
    我们在管理工作上开展“九条线、一根绳”竞赛的主要经验，首先是加强党的领导，坚持贯彻执行政治挂帅、大搞群众运动的方针。我厂过去曾在一个相当长的时间里，由于一些不合理的管理方法，忽视党的领导，不要群众路线，束缚了群众的生产积极性，使管理工作落后于群众生产运动的矛盾不断扩大。实行党委领导下的厂长负责制和贯彻“两参一改三结合”的制度以后，管理工作有了很大改进与提高，在学习和推广鞍山第三炼钢厂技术表演赛的经验中，党委加强领导，大搞群众运动，就创造了企业管理三结合大协作竞赛的经验。事实证明，通过这种大搞群众运动的方法，企业管理工作落后于生产发展的局面就得到了迅速的改变。
    其次是，在加强党的具体领导的同时，充分发挥行政、工会、共青团各级组织的作用。在竞赛中，党委经常不断地分析形势，掌握运动的规律，加强对管理人员的政治思想领导，及时地指出生产关键和竞赛方向，使运动健康地发展。行政领导上则充分发挥科室作用，及时布置工作，明确关键，提出改进企业管理的具体方向，经常检查督促，解决竞赛中的具体问题，并同工会加强对竞赛的组织领导。工会主要是做好竞赛的组织工作和评比工作，特别是不断地根据生产和管理中的问题，发动各个专业系统搞好大协作，把各个环节拧成一根绳，并及时开展大评比、大交流、立标兵、插红旗的群众运动和奖励工作。共青团组织发动广大团员和青年，积极参加竞赛，革新业务，学习先进经验，并配合工会用各种文艺形式，宣传新人新事，激发职工群众参加竞赛的热情。
    再次是，开展这一竞赛，除了紧紧抓住干部参加劳动、深入生产、领导生产外，还必须抓住工人参加管理这一环。因为一切管理工作都必须最后通过工人来贯彻实现，而管理工作中的一切根据又来之于生产实际和工人之手。所以，只有使工人真正作到既是生产者、又是管理者，企业管理才会有坚实可靠的群众基础。我厂管理工作正是在工人群众的直接参加和积极支持下，才得到迅速改进和提高的。加强工人参加管理的关键，一方面在于充分发动和组织专业管理人员深入车间班组，具体帮助和指导工人管理员熟悉业务、开展工作，使专业管理与群众管理紧密结合；另一方面党支部还必须加强具体领导，发挥党小组的核心作用，经常教育工人提高主人翁责任感，不断健全和巩固工人参加管理的组织，及时指导、检查和督促工人管理员的工作。
