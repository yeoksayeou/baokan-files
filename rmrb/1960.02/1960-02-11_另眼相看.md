Seeing Corn in a New Light
Su Yi

In early spring, as the northern regions just begin to thaw, the early corn in Xinxu Commune, Jingxi County, Guangxi Province, is already lush green. Although the people here plant corn every year, this year they are clearly regarding this crop with a different feeling and from a different perspective: planting was advanced by one solar term, the land was tilled and harrowed three times each, over 100 dan of base fertilizer was applied, and all of it was densely planted with improved varieties. The position of corn in people's production and life has clearly undergone a great change.

Corn is a high-yielding and excellent crop, both a grain that the people love to eat and a good feed. Therefore, whether from the need to develop grain production at a high speed or from the need to develop animal husbandry centered on pig raising at a high speed, we should look at corn in a new light.

The first manifestation of seeing corn in a new light is to appropriately expand the planting area. Many regions have already paid attention to appropriately expanding the planting area of corn when arranging the production layout of this year's crops. Tianjin City, Hebei Province, plans to plant 8 million mu of corn this year, an increase of 76% over last year. Anhui Province is preparing to expand the planting area of corn by intercropping, relay cropping, and planting in vacant land. This also makes full use of the advantages of corn. Because corn is a tall-stalked crop, it is very suitable for intercropping and relay cropping with many short-stalked crops such as soybeans and sweet potatoes. This not only does not affect the sowing area of the original crops, but also greatly improves land utilization and increases the total grain output.

The second manifestation of seeing corn in a new light is to do everything possible to increase the yield per unit area of ​​corn. In the past, due to the lack of attention to corn, the planting of corn was relatively rough in both the north and the south, with less base fertilizer applied and insufficient land tillage, so the production potential of corn has not been fully exploited. In fact, as long as it is carefully cultivated and well managed, the yield of corn can be greatly increased. There are many measures to increase the yield per unit area of ​​corn, starting with sowing to lay a foundation. First, appropriately advance the planting time and plant more early corn. According to typical investigations in Anhui Province, the yield of early corn can be more than 50% higher than that of late corn. Secondly, apply sufficient base fertilizer when sowing, select improved varieties, and pay attention to cultivation techniques. Last year, Guang'an County, Sichuan, promoted directional cultivation and wide-narrow row planting methods, and the county's 50,000 mu of early corn created a large-scale high-yield record of an average yield of 1,028 jin per mu. This is a cultivation technique worthy of promotion.

The spring is bright and the season urges people on. All regions should start early, plant corn in large quantities, quickly, and well, so that this high-yield crop can shine brightly this year!

    另眼相看
    苏宜
    早春天气，北方地区刚刚开始溶冰化雪，广西省靖西县新墟公社的早玉米却已是一片葱绿。这里的人们虽然年年栽种玉米，但今年显然怀着不同的心情、以不同的眼光来看待这一作物：下种提早了一个节令，耕地做到了三犁三耙，底肥下到一百多担，全部密植和采用了良种。玉米在人们的生产和生活中的位置，显然已经起了很大的变化。
    玉米是一种既高产又优良的作物，既是人民都喜爱吃的粮食，又是很好的饲料。因此，无论从高速度发展粮食生产，也无论从高速度发展以养猪为中心的畜牧生产的需要来说，都应该对玉米加以另眼看待。
    另眼看待的第一个表现是，适当扩大种植面积。许多地区在安排今年农作物的生产布局时，已经注意到适当扩大玉米的种植面积。河北省天津市今年计划种玉米八百万亩，比去年增加76％。安徽省准备用间种、套种、空闲地里增种的办法，扩大玉米的种植面积。这也是充分利用了玉米的优点。因为玉米是一种高秆作物，很适宜和许多矮秆作物如大豆、红薯等间种、套种。这样既不影响原来作物的播种面积，还能大大提高土地利用率，增加粮食的总产量。
    另眼看待的第二个表现是，千方百计地提高玉米的单位面积产量。过去由于对玉米不重视，无论北方、南方栽种玉米都比较粗糙，底肥下得较少，土地耕耙功夫不深，因而还没有充分发挥玉米的生产潜力。其实，只要精耕细作，管理得好，玉米产量可以大大提高。提高玉米的单位面积产量的措施很多，从播种开始，就要打下基础。一是要适当提早栽种时间，多种早玉米。据安徽省典型调查，早玉米产量可比晚玉米高50％以上。其次，播种时要下足底肥，选用良种，讲究栽培技术。四川广安县去年推行定向培育和宽窄行种植法，全县五万亩早玉米创造了平均亩产一千零二十八斤的大面积高产纪录。这是一个值得推广的栽培技术。
    春光灿烂，季节催人。各地应该及早动手，把玉米种得又多又快又好，使这一高产作物在今年大放异采！
