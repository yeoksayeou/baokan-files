Xinhua News Agency, Changchun Telegram. Small and medium-sized factories in Kuancheng District, Changchun City, have closely cooperated to jointly establish an amateur industrial college. Over the past year, by strengthening the Party's leadership and earnestly implementing the Party's educational policy, they have cultivated a group of technical personnel, which has promoted the development of production. Among the participating workers, 535 have reached the level of a first-year student in full-time universities with similar departments, and 474 have a high school education level. The students of the entire college have proposed more than 1,000 major technological innovation and revolution suggestions.

During the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958, many handicraft production cooperatives in Kuancheng District, Changchun City, developed into local state-owned factories, increasing new product varieties, and production gradually moved towards mechanization. Because of the rapid development of these small and medium-sized factories, the existing cultural and technical level of the broad masses of workers could no longer meet the needs. At the same time, each factory did not have the strength to independently establish an amateur university, and some skilled workers with the equivalent of a high school education level were unable to get the opportunity to pursue further studies, and their technical level could not be rapidly improved. Based on this situation, the Kuancheng District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, while vigorously establishing various types of amateur cultural schools for workers, adopted the form of joint school-running by various factories to establish this amateur industrial college. Workers, technicians and administrative cadres with high school graduation and equivalent high school education are recruited to participate in the study, with a term of four and a half years. Upon graduation, they can reach the level of graduates from full-time junior college.

This amateur industrial college, based on the production needs of the district's electrical machinery industry, metallurgical industry, and light industry, has set up five majors including machinery manufacturing, electrical machinery, and chemical engineering. In terms of curriculum, teaching plans, and class hours, appropriate arrangements have been made based on the principle of starting from reality, combining with production, and serving production. At present, there are more than 500 students in the college. The college has also established a secondary vocational department according to the needs of various factories, offering majors in fitter, turner, planer, and chemical engineering, to train intermediate technical personnel. There are currently more than 400 workers enrolled.

Joint school-running by small and medium-sized factories has fully utilized the potential of each factory and solved the problem of insufficient teachers. In addition to cooperating with Jilin University and Jilin Normal University and hiring their teachers to teach, this amateur industrial college mainly organizes the technical cadres of the factories under Kuancheng District, Changchun City, who have both theoretical knowledge and rich production experience, and they serve as part-time teachers. In order to continuously improve the quality of teaching, the factory assigned a Party branch secretary to serve as the director of teaching affairs of the college. Teachers and students are frequently convened for discussion meetings to understand the teaching situation and solve the specific problems existing in teaching. The college also strengthens the teachers' political and ideological education to enhance their sense of political responsibility, so that they carefully prepare lessons and continuously improve the quality of teaching.

Since its establishment more than a year ago, this amateur industrial college has made remarkable achievements in improving students' scientific and technical level and cultivating technical personnel. After one year of study, the university class students' theoretical knowledge has reached the level of first-year students in corresponding departments of full-time universities. After one year of study, the students in the secondary vocational department also have a high school education. In the past year, all the students have proposed more than 1,000 major technological innovation and technological transformation projects in production.

    长春宽城区中小型工厂密切合作
    联合举办业余工业学院
    一年来培养一批技术人材促进生产发展
    新华社长春电　长春市宽城区三十二个中、小型工厂联合举办了一所业余工业学院，一年来由于加强党的领导，认真贯彻执行了党的教育方针，已经培养出一批技术人材，促进了生产的发展。参加学习的职工中，已有五百三十五名达到全日制大学相同科系的一年级生水平，四百七十四名具有高中文化水平；全院学员提出的重大的技术革新和技术革命建议共一千多项。
    1958年工农业生产大跃进时，长春市宽城区的许多手工业生产合作社都发展成为地方国营工厂，增加了新的生产品种，生产逐步走向机械化。由于这些中小型工厂生产迅速发展，广大职工现有的文化技术水平已经不能满足需要。同时，各工厂又没有力量独立创办业余大学，部分具有相当于高中文化水平的技术工人得不到进修的机会，技术水平不能迅速提高。根据这一情况，中共长春市宽城区委在大办各级各类职工业余文化学校的同时，采用各工厂联合办学的形式，举办起这所业余工业学院。招收具有高中毕业和相当于高中文化程度的工人、技术人员和行政管理干部参加学习，年限为四年半，毕业后，可以达到全日制大专学校毕业水平。
    这个业余工业学院根据全区电机工业、冶金工业、轻工业的生产需要，设置了机械制造、电机、化工等五个专业。在课程设置、教学计划、授课时间等方面，本着从实际出发，结合生产，为生产服务的原则，作了妥善安排。目前，全院共有学员五百多名。学院还根据各工厂的需要，建立了中等专业部，设有技工、车工、钳工、化工等专业，培养中级技术人材，现有四百多名工人入学。
    中、小型工厂联合办学，充分发挥了各厂的潜力，解决了师资不足的问题。这个业余工业学院除和吉林大学、吉林师范大学协作，聘请它们的教师讲课外，主要是把长春市宽城区所属各工厂的既有理论知识又富有生产经验的技术干部组织起来，由他们担任兼职教师。为了不断提高教学质量，工厂抽调一名党支部书记担任学院的教导主任。经常召开师生座谈会，了解教学情况，解决教学中存在的具体问题。学院并通过加强教师们的政治思想教育，提高他们政治责任感的办法，使他们认真备课，不断提高授课质量。
    这所业余工业学院建立一年多来，在提高学员的科学技术水平和培养技术人材上，已经取得了显著成绩。大学班学员，经过一年的学习，理论知识已经达到全日制大学相应科、系一年级的水平。中等专业部的学员经过一年的学习，也都具有高中文化程度。一年多来，全体学员在生产中，曾提出了一千多项较大的技术革新和技术改革项目。
