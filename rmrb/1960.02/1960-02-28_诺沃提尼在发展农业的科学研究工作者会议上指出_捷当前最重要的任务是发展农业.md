    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 26th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia convened a meeting of scientific researchers on the development of agricultural production in Prague on the 24th and 25th of February.

    In his opening speech, the President of the Republic and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, Novotný, pointed out that the victory of socialist management methods in Czechoslovakia's agricultural production has created the premise for proposing new and more arduous tasks for agriculture, and that such tasks can only be accomplished by socialist large-scale agricultural production.

    Novotný said that the tasks facing the Czechoslovak people on the road to achieving a turning point in the development of agricultural production are: (1) Agricultural production should be regarded as the most important task at present, and during the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965), efforts and resources should be concentrated on solving this task.

    (2) The development of crop production should be regarded as the foundation of agricultural production development. This requires maximizing the utilization of land, ensuring sufficient water supply, managing land correctly, and improving fertilization.

    (3) Sowing procedures should be well observed, and the quality of seeds and seedlings should be improved. In crop production, priority should be given to establishing a feed base, and the planting of silage corn as the main feed should be implemented more thoroughly.

    (4) The livestock feed should be fully based on large-scale production, the sanitary conditions of livestock herds should be improved, and the milk yield and fat content of dairy cows should be increased.

    (5) Measures should continue to be taken in the construction of the agricultural technical base, first of all to mechanize harvesting and livestock production.

    In his speech, Novotný also emphasized the importance of ensuring that experts go deep into production. He said that in the future, the entire cadre training work should be more and more directly integrated with production.

    In his speech, Novotný also spoke about the significance of the Moscow meeting of representatives from European socialist countries' communist and workers' parties to exchange experience in developing agriculture. He said that the main purpose of this meeting was to ensure, under close cooperation between European socialist countries, that their agricultural production would achieve abundant products in the shortest possible time.

    The meeting participants discussed how to further improve agricultural production.

    The discussion showed that Czechoslovakia has the conditions to achieve a turning point in agricultural production in the shortest possible time, and that there are conditions for overfulfilling the agricultural targets in the Third Five-Year Plan.

    The discussion also emphasized the great significance of further scientific and research support for state farms and agricultural cooperatives.

    诺沃提尼在发展农业的科学研究工作者会议上指出
    捷当前最重要的任务是发展农业
    新华社布拉格26日电　捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会24日和25日在布拉格召开了关于发展农业生产的科学研究工作者会议。
    共和国总统、捷共中央第一书记诺沃提尼在开幕词中指出，捷克斯洛伐克农业生产中社会主义经营方式的胜利，为向农业提出新的更艰巨的任务创造了前提，而这种任务也只有社会主义的农业大生产才能完成。
    诺沃提尼说，捷克斯洛伐克人民在使农业生产的发展达到转折的道路上所面临的任务是：（1）应当把农业生产作为当前最重要的任务，在第三个五年计划（1961—1965年）期间，应当集中力量和工具来解决这项任务。
    （2）应当把农作物生产的发展当作农业生产发展的基础。这就需要最大限度地利用土地，使水量充足，正确地经营土地，改善施肥。
    （3）应当很好地遵守播种程序，提高种子和秧苗的质量。在农作物生产中应当首先保证建立饲料基地，并且要更加彻底地执行把种植青贮玉米作为主要饲料。
    （4）应当把牲畜的饲料充分建立在大生产的基地上，改善牲畜群的卫生状况，提高乳牛的奶产量和牛奶的含脂率。
    （5）应当在农业技术基础的建设方面继续采取措施，首先使收割工作和畜牧业生产机械化。
    诺沃提尼在讲话中还强调确保专家深入到生产中去的重要性。他说，今后整个的干部培养工作应当更多地、更直接地与生产相结合。
    诺沃提尼在讲话中还谈到了在莫斯科召开的欧洲社会主义国家共产党和工人党交流发展农业经验代表会议的意义。他说，这次会议的主要目的是，在欧洲社会主义国家之间紧密合作的情况下，保证它们的农业生产在最短期间得到丰裕的产品。
    会议参加者对如何进一步提高农业生产的问题进行了讨论。
    讨论表明，捷克斯洛伐克存在着使农业生产在尽可能短的时间内达到转折的条件，存在着超额完成第三个五年计划中农业指标的条件。
    讨论中还强调了科学和研究工作进一步支援国营农场和农业合作社的重大意义。
