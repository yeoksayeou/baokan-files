Piercing Through Clouds and Mist to Rescue Relatives

On the evening of February 3rd, the office of a squadron of the Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army was unusually busy. Political Commissar Zhang Zijia and the squadron leader, deputy political commissar, chief of staff, and others were intently studying an order they had just received. The mission was: to fly to Pinglu, Shanxi, and airdrop medicine to rescue poisoned workers.

The incident unfolded as follows: More than sixty workers from the Pinglu County Road Maintenance Engineering Team suffered food poisoning at noon on February 3rd. The Ministry of Health's Special Pharmaceuticals Department was supporting them with one thousand doses of special injectable medicine, which had to be delivered within twenty-four hours. Otherwise, if the toxicity continued for too long, the patients' lives would be in danger! If sent by train, it would take at least forty-eight hours to arrive; even taking a flight would only reach Taiyuan, and from Taiyuan, transportation by car would take two days. Therefore, they consulted with the Air Force. The leaders of the unit immediately agreed and ordered a special plane to carry out this mission.

This nighttime airdrop was to be conducted without ground command or air-ground communication. Added to this was the complex terrain with towering mountains, and the fact that the airdropped items were liquid medicine. The urgency of the time made it a truly difficult task. To ensure that the medicine was delivered on time without any mistakes, experienced and technically skilled soldiers had to be sent. The squadron leaders finally decided: to equip two sets of cadres from within the entire squadron, led by pilot Zhou Lianshan, Zhang Pinyuan, navigator Tian Weizhi, navigator Guo Yunshu, communications officer Fang Chengren, and mechanics Liu Wanmin, Zhou Bide, and others to complete the mission. The take-off time was set at 21:00, with delivery by 23:30.

	Before Take-off

The airport became bustling. Mechanics and ground crew were inspecting the aircraft in the cold wind, tightening every screw and every fuse. Squadron Leader Cai Yancheng and the pilots held a "Zhuge Liang meeting" to study the flight route and airdrop methods. The terrain of Pinglu was such that the south of the city was a 1,300-meter slope, and the northwest corner was a 1,500-meter peak. If the aircraft's altitude was lower than 1,500 meters, there was a risk of hitting the mountain. The medicine weighed only ten kilograms, and dropping it from such a high altitude, without knowing the ground wind direction and speed, would obviously be difficult to aim accurately. After the commanders told everyone about these situations, some pilots suggested immediately calling the Pinglu County Party Committee to find out the location and direction of the airdrop; others suggested expanding the target fire on the ground to 500 square meters, and only lighting it after hearing the sound of the plane, to avoid lighting it too early or too late. Some also suggested that the medicine box was too light and difficult to accurately drop, so it needed to be weighted, and flashlights could be tied to both sides of the box so that people below could follow the flashlight beams to find it. A series of problems were solved, and everyone was trying every possible means to gain time.

	Breaking Through Clouds and Mist

At 20:30, preparations for the flight were complete. All personnel were "on standby" at the airport with unwavering confidence. To prevent parachutes from malfunctioning at the last minute, the commander specially sent a parachute safety officer to accompany the flight.

Before departure, the commander said to the pilots, "You are representing our Air Force, carrying the hearts of the people of the capital to provide emergency aid! We are the people's soldiers, and today our relatives are in trouble, so we must do everything possible to rescue them, without the slightest carelessness! You must know that if even a small detail is not considered carefully, lives will be lost!" These words were deeply etched in the soldiers' hearts.

The plane started, and the roar of the powerful engine shook the night sky. In the cold wind, the political commissar and other responsible comrades accompanied the pilots onto the plane. The navigator walked last, his tall figure standing at the cabin door, waving goodbye to everyone and firmly stating, "Please rest assured, leaders, we guarantee to complete the mission!"

The cabin door closed, and the plane, carrying the earnest concern of the Party and the people of the capital, pierced through the clouds and mist, flying into the vast sky.

The plane swept across the North China Plain, flying towards Shengrenjian—a small town that could not be found on ordinary maps. Rolling clouds rushed head-on. They blocked the moonlight, and visibility deteriorated.

The sound of ground radar navigation kept coming through the radio. Zhou Lianshan was concentrating on the instruments, and the parachute safety officer was repeatedly checking the parachute ropes. Other soldiers were studying the details of the airdrop. ...

	"Thank you, Party and Chairman Mao!"

The plane crossed the airspace above the Zhongtiao Mountains, below which was the rushing Yellow River.

"Sanmenxia!" someone exclaimed in surprise. In another ten minutes, they would reach Shengrenjian. Zhou Lianshan told everyone to prepare and opened the cabin door. A large gust of cold wind rushed in, and the temperature inside the cabin suddenly dropped.

Airdropping from an altitude of 2,000 meters was obviously not safe. It was necessary to descend, the lower the better for accuracy. Zhou Lianshan pressed down on the control stick, and the plane descended from 2,700 meters to 2,500 meters, then to 2,000, 1,500, 1,000...500 meters. Tall mountain silhouettes passed by the fuselage. This was a battle of courage and skill. The soldiers opened their eyes wide and began searching for the firelight on the ground. There was no sound in the cabin except for the vibration of the engine. Suddenly, four piles of firelight appeared. They shouted in unison, "Signal found!"

Liu Wanmin strode to the door, dragging the medicine box. Perhaps because he was too nervous, the safety belt was so tight that he could hardly breathe. At this moment, the bell rang. He suddenly loosened the safety belt, grabbed the iron handle on the door with his left hand, and threw the box out with all his might. The strong wind blew his hat far away.

The plane quickly climbed to a high altitude and left the canyon. After they arrived in Zhengzhou, they immediately inspected the plane. Because whether the airdrop was successful was still unknown, they could only consider the worst-case scenario and prepare for another take-off.

The soldiers gathered around the telephone, anxiously waiting for a reply from Pinglu. At 3:15, the phone rang, and the voice of County Party Secretary Hao Shishan came from the receiver. His voice was very excited: "All the airdropped medicine has been safely received and is now being used! On behalf of the people of Pinglu County, I thank the Party and Chairman Mao for their concern! Thank you to the people of the capital for their support! Thank you to the Air Force comrades for their help!" At this moment, a strong warm current surged through every sincere heart….

At dawn, the Air Force soldiers and their plane, facing the rising sun, returned victoriously and joyfully.

    穿云破雾救亲人
    2月3日傍晚，中国人民解放军空军某部一大队的办公室里，显得异常忙碌。政委张子甲和大队长、副政委、参谋长等正在聚精会神地研究一份刚才接到的命令。任务是：飞往山西平陆，空投药品抢救中毒工人。
    事情经过是：平陆县养路工程队的六十多个工人，3日中午发生食物中毒事故。卫生部特种药品部支援他们的一千支特效注射剂，必须在二十四小时以内送到。否则，毒性延续过久，病人就有生命危险！如果通过火车送去，最少要四十八个小时才能到达；搭航班机也只能到太原，在太原再经汽车运送，需要两天；所以，他们就和空军部队洽商。部队领导人立即答应了，下令派一架专机执行这个任务。
    这次夜间空投，是在没有地面指挥和空地联络的情况下进行，加上地形复杂，山峦重重，空投的又是水剂药品，时间是如此紧急，确是件不容易的事。要保证万无一失地把药品按时送到，就要派有经验的技术熟练的战士去执行。大队干部最后决定：在全队范围内配备两套干部，由机长周连珊、张品元，领航长田维智、领航员郭云书，通讯长方成仁，机械师刘万敏、周必德等去完成。时间确定在二十一点起飞，二十三点三十分送到。
          在起飞前
    机场上忙碌起来了。机械师和地勤人员们在寒风中检查飞机，他们把每一个螺钉，每一条保险丝紧了又紧。大队长蔡演成和飞行员一起开“诸葛亮会”研究飞行航线和空投方法。平陆的地形：城南是一千三百米的山坡，西北角是一千五百米的高峰，飞机航行高度如果低行一千五百米就有触山危险。所带的药品只有十公斤，从这样高处往下投，在不明地面风向和风速的情况下，显然是很难投准的。当指挥员把这些情况告诉大家以后，飞行员们有的提出立即打电话给中共平陆县委，查明空投的方位和地点；有的说把地面上作为目标的火堆扩大到五百平方米，闻到机声后再点火，避免过早或过晚。也有的提出药箱太轻，投出后难以准确，需要增加配重，在箱子两侧绑上电筒，下面的人可跟着电筒光寻找。一连串难题解决了，眼前是千方百计，争得时间。
          突破云雾
    二十点三十分，飞行前准备完毕了。全体人员都怀着必胜的信心在机场“待命”。为了防止降落伞临时发生故障，指挥员特地派了一名保伞员随机出发。
    临行前，指挥员对飞行员们说：“你们是代表我们空军带着首都人民的心意去急救的！我们是人民的子弟兵，今天亲人有难，一定要想尽一切办法来援救他们，不能有丝毫的马虎！要知道，稍有一点细节考虑不周到，就会出人命呵！”这些话，深深记在战士们的心里。
    飞机起动了，巨大的马达声震撼着夜空。寒风中，政委和其他负责同志一直送飞行员上了飞机。领航长走在最后面，他那魁伟的身材立在机舱门口，挥手向大家告别，并坚定地表示：“请首长放心，我们保证完成任务！”
    机门掩上了，飞机带着党和首都人民殷切的关怀，穿云破雾，飞进茫茫的天空。
    飞机掠过华北平原，向圣人涧——这个一般地图上找不到的小镇子飞去。滚滚的云团迎面扑来。它隔断了月光，能见度越来越坏。
    无线电里不断传来地面雷达导航的声音。周连珊全神贯注地看着仪表，保伞员一次又一次地检查伞绳。其他战士在研究空投的细节问题。……
        “感谢党和毛主席！”
    飞机越过中条山上空，下面就是奔腾的黄河。
  “三门峡！”有人惊喜地叫起来。再过十分钟就到圣人涧了。周连珊叫大家做好准备，打开舱门。大股大股的冷风从外面卷进来，舱内的气温突然下降。
    在二千米的高度空投，显然是不保险的。必须降低，越低越准。周连珊压了压操纵杆，飞机便由二千七百米降到二千五百米，接着是二千、一千五、一千……五百。高大的山影从机身旁边逸去，这是一场勇敢加技术的搏斗。战士们睁着双眼，开始搜索地面的火光。机舱里除了发动机的震响外没有一点杂音。突然，四堆火光出现了。他们不约而同地喊：“发现信号！”
    刘万敏大步跨到门前，拖着药箱。也许是太紧张的缘故，身上的保险带箍得他气都透不过来。这时，电铃响了，他猛一下松开保险带，左手抓住门上的铁把，用尽全力把箱子掷出去。强劲的风，把他的帽子掀出去好远。
    飞机迅速爬上高空，离开了峡谷。他们到达郑州以后，立即检查飞机。因为空投是否成功还不知道，只能从最坏的情况去考虑，做再次起飞的准备。
    战士们围在电话机旁，焦急地等待平陆的答复。三点一刻，电话来了，话筒里传出县委书记郝世山的声音，他的声音很激动：“空投的药品全部安全收到，现在已经用上了！我代表平陆县人民感谢党和毛主席的关怀！感谢首都人民的支援！感谢空军同志的帮助！”这时，一股强烈的暖流激荡着每一颗赤诚的心……。
    黎明时分，空军战士和他们的飞机迎着朝阳，满怀胜利的喜悦顺利地返航了。
