    The CCP Central Committee and the State Council Issue Instructions on Current Vegetable Work:
    Seize Spring Vegetable Production and Arrange for Year-Round Vegetable Work
    Emphasizing that doing a good job in vegetable production and supply is an important economic and political task that must be grasped season after season.
    Requires all cities and rural areas to guarantee increased spring vegetable production, strengthen winter vegetable management, and comprehensively arrange for summer, autumn, and winter vegetables.

    The CCP Central Committee, the State Council, on Current Vegetable Work Instructions
                            February 18, 1960

    In 1959, the national vegetable work achieved a great victory. The vast majority of cities, industrial and mining areas, and many construction sites have achieved basic self-sufficiency in vegetables. Vegetable production in rural areas has also greatly developed. This has played a huge role in ensuring the needs of urban and rural people for non-staple foods and improving their lives. At present, the vegetable supply in various places is generally sufficient, and the situation on the national vegetable front is good. However, there is still imbalance in regions and varieties, and various places should continue to pay attention to planned vegetable consumption to ensure a balanced supply of existing vegetables.

    The current task is to further seize spring vegetable production on the basis of the great victory achieved last year, and at the same time make arrangements for the work throughout the year. It should be seen that vegetable production is highly seasonal, requiring freshness, planting one season and eating one season. Therefore, in terms of work, one season must follow another, and each season must be grasped tightly. We must not lessen our attention to vegetable issues and relax our work simply because of the bumper harvest of autumn vegetables last year, and some places once seemed to have too much, and there are still many vegetables in hand now. It should also be seen that the demand for vegetables in cities, industrial and mining areas, and construction sites this year has increased even more than last year; rural areas also need more vegetables; at the same time, with the great development of animal husbandry, the melon and vegetables used as feed will also increase greatly. It should be seen that doing a good job in the production and supply of vegetables in all seasons this year, especially spring vegetables, is not only an important economic task, but also an important political task.

    The Party committees and people's committees of all cities and rural areas must seize spring vegetable production. It must be guaranteed that spring vegetables have sufficient planting area, and the number of mu planted with vegetables must not be squeezed out because of the development of other crops. At the same time, we must also do a good job in the water conservancy construction of vegetable bases, do a good job in accumulating fertilizer and applying fertilizer, and ensure that the vegetable fields are full of water and fertilizer to increase production. We must earnestly arrange the labor force required for vegetable production, further establish and improve specialized vegetable-growing teams, and mobilize the masses to vigorously carry out tool reforms to improve labor efficiency. While grasping early spring vegetable planting, we must also strengthen the management of overwintering vegetables so that overwintering vegetables and spring vegetables can be harvested and supplied earlier, so that urban and rural people can eat more and better vegetables in spring and summer.

    Local Party committees and people's committees must make year-round arrangements for vegetable production and supply this year. We must arrange for spring vegetables, as well as summer, autumn, and winter vegetables; we must increase the quantity, and also increase the variety; we must arrange for the supply of commercial vegetables to cities, industrial and mining areas, and construction sites, and also arrange for the self-sufficient vegetables for rural self-consumption and use as feed; we must arrange for vegetable production, and also arrange for vegetable processing and storage, and increase processing and storage equipment. We must connect the production plan with the consumption plan, connect the market needs with the production arrangement, connect the time of production and supply of vegetables in various seasons and varieties, and connect the cooperative relationship between industry, agriculture, commerce, and transportation. In this way, we can ensure a more coordinated development of production and a more balanced supply.

    The CCP Central Committee and the State Council instruct Party committees and people's committees at all levels to grasp and implement this year's vegetable work, conduct continuous inspections, and ensure the complete realization of various tasks. At the same time, we must systematically summarize the past experience in vegetable work in terms of sowing, field management, harvesting, distribution, supply, processing, and storage, and continuously supplement and improve it to promote the continued development of vegetable work.

    中共中央和国务院发布关于当前蔬菜工作的指示
    抓紧春季蔬菜生产　安排全年蔬菜工作
    强调指出做好蔬菜生产和供应是一项重要的经济任务和政治任务，必须一季接一季、季季都抓紧
    要求所有城市和农村保证增加春菜产量，加强越冬蔬菜管理，全面安排夏菜、秋菜和冬菜
    新华社18日讯　中共中央、国务院关于当前蔬菜工作的指示
                            一九六○年二月十八日
    一九五九年全国蔬菜工作获得了伟大的胜利。绝大多数城市、工矿区和许多建设工地，都做到蔬菜基本自给。农村中蔬菜生产也有了很大发展。这对于保证城乡人民副食品需要、改善生活起了巨大的作用。目前各地的蔬菜供应一般是充足的，全国蔬菜战线上的情况是良好的。但是在地区上和品种上还不平衡，各地应当继续注意计划用菜，使现有蔬菜做到均衡供应。
    当前的任务是，在去年获得巨大胜利的基础上，进一步抓紧春季蔬菜生产，同时做好全年工作安排。应当看到，蔬菜生产，季节性强，要求鲜嫩，种一季，吃一季。因此，在工作上要一季接着一季，季季都得抓紧。决不能因为去年秋菜大丰收，有的地方一时曾经显得多了一些，现在手里存菜也还不少，就减轻了对蔬菜问题的重视，放松了工作。还应当看到，城市、工矿区、工地今年对蔬菜的需要比去年更增长了；农村也需要更多的蔬菜；同时，随着畜牧业的大发展，用作饲料的瓜菜也会大大增加。应当看到，把今年各季蔬菜、首先是春季蔬菜的生产和供应工作做好，不仅是一项重要的经济任务，而且是一项重要的政治任务。
    所有的城市和农村的党委和人民委员会，都要抓紧春菜生产。必须保证春菜有足够的播种面积，不能因为发展其他作物，挤掉蔬菜的种植亩数。同时还要相应地做好蔬菜基地的水利建设，做好积肥施肥工作，保证菜田水饱肥足，增加产量。必须认真安排蔬菜生产所需用的劳动力，进一步建立和健全种菜的专业队伍，并且发动群众，大搞工具改革，提高劳动效率。在抓紧早种春菜的同时，还要加强越冬蔬菜的管理，使越冬菜和春菜都能提早收获、提前供应，使城乡人民都能在春夏吃到更多更好的蔬菜。
    各地党委和人民委员会都要做好今年蔬菜生产和供应的全年安排。既要安排春菜，又要安排夏菜、秋菜和冬菜；既要增加数量，又要增加品种；既要安排供应城市、工矿区、工地的商品性蔬菜，又要安排农村自食和用作饲料的自给性蔬菜；既要安排蔬菜的生产，又要安排蔬菜的加工和保管，增添加工储存设备。必须把生产计划和消费计划衔接好，把市场需要和生产安排衔接好，把各个季节、各个品种蔬菜生产和供应的时间衔接好，把工业、农业、商业、交通的协作关系衔接好。这样，才能够保证更协调地发展生产，更均衡地进行供应。
    中共中央和国务院责成各级党委和人民委员会对今年蔬菜工作抓紧抓实，不断进行检查，保证各项任务的完满实现。同时，对过去蔬菜工作在播种、田间管理、收获、分配、供应、加工、储藏等各方面经验进行系统的总结，并且不断加以补充和完善，以促进蔬菜工作的继续发展。
