    Hold High the Red Banner of High-Speed, High-Quality Basic Construction
    Li Yiqing, Secretary of the Party Committee and General Manager of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company
    1958 and 1959 were the two years of large-scale development of the Wuhan Iron and Steel construction, and also the two years of the Great Leap Forward in the Wuhan Iron and Steel construction. In 1958, one blast furnace and two coke ovens were completed and put into production ahead of schedule. In 1959, another blast furnace, two coke ovens, three open-hearth furnaces, four sintering machines, three sets of flotation (mineral processing) equipment, and part of the workshops of the refractory material plant were completed and put into production ahead of schedule. So many important projects were completed and put into production in just two short years, which is unprecedented in the construction of the metallurgical industry. These projects not only achieved high speed, but also high quality. After acceptance, the main parts of each project were of excellent quality, reaching and exceeding the design requirements. These many projects have also proven to be of good quality after production testing. Not only is production smooth and without accidents, but in the period when production was still unstable, many units broke through the design indicators. All relevant parts can connect and cooperate, and operate jointly. Some people say that speed cannot be good. On the contrary, the facts of Wuhan Iron and Steel prove that our construction can completely achieve both high speed and high quality.
        The Masses Have Mastered the Thinking of the Great Leap Forward
    The Great Leap Forward in the Wuhan Iron and Steel construction is the result of the broad masses of workers recognizing and mastering the laws of high-speed construction under the socialist system. In the movement to increase production and practice economy, the workers of Wuhan Iron and Steel proposed to oppose two more (leaving too much leeway, seeing too many difficulties), two less (seeing less of the favorable conditions, seeing less of the enthusiasm of the masses), and one insufficient (underestimating potential), opposing the thinking that was not adapted to the situation of the Great Leap Forward. In the Great Leap Forward over the past two years, they have realized a truth: high-speed construction must have soaring enthusiasm, and the thinking of the Great Leap Forward is the foundation of soaring enthusiasm. In the Great Leap Forward, the conditions are not always fully available and smooth sailing; but with the thinking of the Great Leap Forward, in the face of difficulties, they will not be intimidated, but will overcome difficulties one by one, batch by batch. They said heroically: "The sky says the sky is big, the earth says the earth is big, but no one has the determination of our working class." Determination is manifested in learning if they don't know, drilling if they don't understand, and learning unfamiliar things in the Great Leap Forward. They quickly learned the concrete pouring project, which requires relatively high standards. They learned to install relatively complex metal structures and mechanical and electrical equipment, and in the case of lack of equipment, they tried every means to overcome difficulties, doing it faster and better each time. It took twenty-seven hours to pour the concrete foundation of Blast Furnace No. 1, and only sixteen hours for the same foundation of Blast Furnace No. 2. It took thirty-three days to install the No. 1 350-ton crane in the steelmaking plant, and only eighteen days for the No. 2 crane of the same size, under conditions not as good as No. 1. Everyone came to a conclusion: "The greater the difficulty, the greater the enthusiasm, the greater the victory." For the sake of the Great Leap Forward, everyone always learns from the advanced, compares with the advanced, and catches up with the advanced; when problems cannot be solved, they always liberate their thinking, use their brains, break superstitions, and dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do. They are vigorous and forge ahead courageously. When the furnace construction workers learned that the construction period of the 100-meter chimney of Baotou Steel reached twenty-one days, they quickly held Zhuge Liang meetings and three-in-one combination meetings, and finally came up with a solution to shorten the chimney of Open-Hearth Furnace No. 1 to fourteen days, and the chimney of Open-Hearth Furnace No. 2 to twelve days. Now the construction period of brother units has been shortened again, and the workers are learning again and catching up again. "The most powerful vitality is the revolutionary class itself." The working class, this is the driving force and potential of the Great Leap Forward, and the creative power of high speed and high quality.
          Enthusiastically Support New Things
    Party organizations must support the initiatives of the masses, which is an indispensable factor in ensuring the Great Leap Forward. In practice, there are often two kinds of thinking that hinder the Great Leap Forward. One is dogmatism, believing in rules and regulations, not believing in the creativity of the masses, and not daring to boldly experiment with what the rules and regulations do not have. The other is empiricism, believing in one's own experience, enshrining experience as the golden rule, and not being able to change it. In the Great Leap Forward, the masses broke down and established, opposing both dogmatism and empiricism, and created new procedures and new methods that conformed to objective laws. Our chimney has been shortened from the initial construction period of 120 days to 12 days, from less than one meter per day to more than eight meters per day, which is a great initiative to break through the old conventions. In the past, people said that heavy-duty factory buildings could not be built on backfilled soil, but some parts of our steelmaking plant were built on backfilled soil, and the results were very good. Who said that old experience cannot be changed? New things will encounter various difficulties in their development. We must resolutely support new things, safeguard new things, and be good at learning valuable lessons from the growth and development of new things.
          Centralized Leadership and Unified Command
    Party organizations must be good at concentrating the will of thousands of people and unifying their actions. Large-scale basic construction is a joint operation of multiple trades and large groups. It must be rhythmic and orderly, tense but not chaotic. This is a problem of combining centralized leadership with a large-scale mass movement, and it is also a problem of the superstructure adapting to the economic base and the relations of production adapting to the productive forces. On this issue, our experience is:
    First, there must be correct planning, which is the basis for leadership and command, and also the basis for the actions of the masses. How should the complex projects and numerous items be arranged to be completed and put into production in a short period of time to facilitate the realization of high speed and high quality, and to suit the laws of the Great Leap Forward? There are two ways. One is to fully launch, advance side by side, and divide the troops to guard the mouth. The other is to concentrate superior forces, finish one batch and then do another. Two different methods produce two different results. The former is to fight a war of attrition; while the latter is to fight an annihilation war, defeat them one by one, leap forward at high speed, and maximize the investment effect as quickly as possible. Wuhan Iron and Steel arranged its planning with high speed as the guiding principle and concentrated its superior forces to fight an annihilation war. On the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the construction policy for 1959 was determined to be "seizing iron, ensuring steel, and starting materials." The whole year was fought in three campaigns: on the basis of preparatory work in the first quarter, the second quarter focused on the ironmaking system with Blast Furnace No. 2 as the center; the third quarter focused on the steelmaking system with Open-Hearth Furnace No. 1 as the center; and the fourth quarter focused on the rolling steel system with rolling steel as the center (mainly primary rolling). This method of clarifying the relationship between the primary and secondary, the main and auxiliary, the urgent needs of production and the non-urgent, and using manpower and material resources in the main direction, "one horse takes the lead, and ten thousand horses gallop," can fully exploit the potential of human resources and ensure the high-speed leap forward of construction. The completion and commissioning of many major projects of Wuhan Iron and Steel in 1959 was the result of adopting this policy, planning and method.
    Second, there must be centralized and unified command. For example, the open-hearth furnace system project includes production, design and construction, and the construction has seven engineering companies, eighteen construction sites and teams, and three affiliated auxiliary units (enterprise companies, metal structure factories, and mechanical power stations), with a total of more than 10,000 people carrying out three-dimensional cross-parallel assembly line operations. Without unified command, it would be chaotic. According to our experience in the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, the political commander-in-chief, comprehensive, and fully authorized on-site command post is the best organizational form for commanding the joint operations of multi-trade and large groups. Its characteristics are two: First, it can fully reflect the requirements of production and overcome the limitations and one-sidedness of the requirements of production by various units; Second, it is close to production and can timely reflect the activities of the site, promoting various relevant units to face the construction site and better and more effectively serve the site. Its role cannot be replaced by various combat units and the overall leadership agency.
    Third, constantly conduct ideological education on communist cooperation for employees. High-speed construction cannot be achieved by one unit or one person. If the broad masses of workers and various departments do not cooperate with each other, asking for conditions but not creating conditions for each other, the result will be that no one can go fast. This problem was solved in the Great Leap Forward, which in turn promoted the Great Leap Forward. The most fundamental problem in doing a good job in collaboration is still a matter of thought, that is, to establish an overall concept: "Sacrificing oneself for others, putting others before oneself," supporting each other, giving way to each other, everyone talking about style, everyone talking about collaboration, politics first, economy second, work first, account later. In this way, the potential power of things and the potential power of people have been greatly exerted. It has truly achieved a full success and a complete victory, and no one has fallen behind.
            Continue the Great Leap Forward
    After two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward, can we still leap forward, can we still have a Great Leap Forward? Our answer is yes, we can still have a Great Leap Forward! Because we have more leadership experience, the general line is more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the conditions will get better day by day. Especially after the vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement has been launched, the work efficiency has been increased by one to dozens of times in a very short period of time. When the construction period of the coke oven reached thirty-five days, didn't some people say that the potential was not great? As a result, the second coke oven of Baotou Steel surpassed us with thirty-three days, and our fourth coke oven surpassed Baotou Steel with twenty-nine days. The situation of development is just like this, chasing each other and leaping forward together. For example, after the construction period of the No. 1 open-hearth furnace chimney was shortened to fourteen days, the No. 2 open-hearth furnace chimney was shortened to twelve days, and the brother units were even faster than us. Who said that development has reached the top and will not move forward? Two years of great practice have strengthened our confidence. We must hold high the red banner of high-speed and high-quality Great Leap Forward and advance victoriously!

    高举基本建设高速优质的红旗
    武汉钢铁公司党委书记兼总经理　李一清
    1958年、1959年是武钢建设大规模展开的两年，也是武钢建设大跃进的两年。1958年，有一座高炉、两座焦炉提前建成投入生产。1959年又有一座高炉、两座焦炉、三座平炉、四台烧结机、三列浮选（选矿）设备和耐火材料厂的部分车间提前建成投入生产。短短的两年，这样多的重要工程建成投入生产，在冶金工业的建设上是史无前例的。这些工程不但做到了速度快，而且质量好。经过验收，各项工程的主要部位都是优等质量，达到和超过了设计要求。这许多工程经过生产考验，也证明质量很好。不仅是生产顺利，没有发生事故，而且在生产还不稳定的时期，不少单位就突破了设计指标，各个有关部分能以衔接配合，联合操作，有人说快了就不能好。相反，武钢的事实证明，我们的建设完全能够做到既高速，又优质。
        群众掌握了跃进的思想
    武钢建设的大跃进，是广大职工群众认识与掌握了社会主义制度下高速度建设的规律的结果。在增产节约运动中，武钢工人提出要反对两多（留余地多，看困难多）、两少（看有利条件少，看群众干劲少）、一不足（估计潜力不足），反对了与大跃进形势不相适应的思想。他们在两年来的跃进中体会了一条真理：高速度建设必须有冲天干劲，跃进思想是冲天干劲的基础。在大跃进中并不是条件完全具备，一帆风顺的；但有了跃进思想，在困难面前，就不会被吓倒，而是一个一个、一批一批地战胜困难。他们豪迈地说：“天说天大，地说地大，谁也没有我们工人阶级的决心大”。决心表现在不会就学，不懂就钻，在跃进中学会生疏的东西。他们很快学会了要求比较高的混凝土浇灌工程。学会了安装比较复杂的金属结构和机械、电气设备，并且在设备缺乏的情况下，千方百计地克服困难，干得一次比一次快，一次比一次好。浇灌一号高炉混凝土基础用了二十七小时，二号高炉同样的基础只用了十六小时。安装炼钢厂一号三百五十吨大吊车用了三十三天，同样大的二号大吊车，在条件不如一号的情况下，只用了十八天。大家得出一条经验：“困难愈大，干劲愈大，胜利愈大”。为了跃进，大家总是学先进、比先进、赶先进；在问题不能解决的时候，总是解放思想，开动脑筋，破除迷信，敢想敢说敢做。他们生气勃勃，奋勇前进。筑炉工人当知道包钢一百米烟囱工期达到二十一天时，迅速开诸葛亮会、三结合会，终于想出办法，使一号平炉烟囱缩短为十四天，二号平炉烟囱又缩短为十二天。现在兄弟单位的工期又缩短了，工人们又在学、又在赶。“最强大的生命力是革命阶级本身”，工人阶级，这是大跃进的动力和潜力，是高速优质的创造力量。
          热情支持新事物
    党组织一定要支持群众的创举，这是保证大跃进不可缺少的因素。在实践中，往往有两种思想妨碍大跃进。一种是教条主义，相信规章制度，不相信群众的创造，规章制度所没有的不敢大胆试验。另一种是经验主义，相信自己的经验，把经验奉为金科玉律，不能更改。在大跃进中，群众大破大立，既反对了教条主义，也反对了经验主义，创造了符合于客观规律的新规程，新方法。我们的烟囱由最初的一百二十天工期缩短为十二天，由日进不到一米。增长为日进八米多，就是冲破清规戒律的一次伟大创举。过去人们说不能在回填土上建筑重型厂房，而我们的炼钢厂就是有若干部分建筑在回填土上的，结果很好。谁说旧经验不能更改？新事物在发展中是会碰到各种各样的困难的，我们要坚决支持新事物，维护新事物，善于从新事物的成长发展中吸取宝贵的教益。
          集中领导统一指挥
    党组织一定要善于集中千万人的意志，统一行动。大规模的基本建设是多工种大兵团联合作战，一定要作到有节奏、有秩序，紧张而不乱。这是集中领导与大搞群众运动相结合的问题，也是上层建筑适应经济基础，生产关系适应生产力的问题。在这个问题上，我们的体会是：
    第一，要有正确的规划，这是领导指挥的依据，也是群众行动的依据。复杂的工程，繁多的项目，短期间内建成投入生产，究竟怎样安排才有利于实现高速优质，才适合大跃进的规律？有两种办法。一种是全面展开，齐头并进，分兵把口。另一种是集中优势兵力，干完一批再干一批。两种不同办法产生两种不同结果。前一种是打消耗战；而后一种则是打歼灭战，各个击破，高速跃进，最快地发挥投资效果。武钢就是以高速度为纲安排规划，集中优势兵力打歼灭战的。在1958年大跃进的基础上，确定1959年的建设方针是抢铁、保钢、材上马”，全年打三个战役：在一季度准备工作的基础上，二季度以二号高炉为中心大战炼铁系统；三季度以一号平炉为中心，大战炼钢系统；四季度以轧钢为中心，大战轧钢系统（主要是初轧）。这种明确主要与次要，主体与辅助、生产急需与不急需的关系，把人力、物力用于主攻方向，“一马当先，万马奔腾”的方法，能够充分发挥人力资源的潜力，保证建设高速度跃进。武钢1959年许多主要工程建成投入生产，就是采取了这一种方针、规划和办法的结果。
    第二，要有集中的统一指挥。如平炉系统工程包括生产、设计、施工三个方面，而施工又有七个工程公司，十八个工地和队，三个附属辅助单位（企业公司，金属结构厂、机械动力站），共一万多人进行立体交叉平行流水作业，没有统一指挥就会乱了套。根据我们1958年、1959年两年大跃进的经验，政治挂帅的、全面的、全权的现场指挥部，是指挥多工种、大兵团联合作战的最好的组织形式。它的特点有二：一，能以全面的反映生产的要求，克服各单位对生产要求的局限性和片面性；2、接近生产、能及时反映现场的活动，促进各有关单位面向工地，更好的更有效的为现场服务。它的作用，不是各个战斗单位和总的领导机构所能代替的。
    第三，不断地对职工进行共产主义大协作的思想教育。高速度建设不是一个单位、一个人所能实现的，如果没有广大工人群众和各个部门的协同动作互相要条件而又不互相创造条件，结果就会谁也走不快。这一问题在大跃进中解决了，反过来又促进了大跃进。搞好协作的最根本的问题还是思想问题，就是要树立整体思想：“舍己为人，先人后己”，互相支援、互相让路，人人谈风格、个个讲协作，先政治、后经济，先干活、后算账。这样就大大发挥了物的潜在力量，也大大发挥了人的潜在力量。真正作到了满堂红，全胜利，谁也没有落后。
            继续大跃进
    在连续两年大跃进之后，是否还能跃进，还能大跃进呢？我们的答复是肯定的，还能大跃进！因为领导经验更多了，总路线更深入人心了，条件会一天比一天好，特别是生气勃勃的技术革新与技术革命运动开展以后，很短期间工效就提高一倍到几十倍。当焦炉砌筑工期达到三十五天的时候，不是就有人说潜力不大了吗？结果包钢第二个焦炉以三十三天超过了我们，我们第四号焦炉又以二十九天超过了包钢，发展的形势就是这样你追我赶，共同跃进的。再如第一号平炉烟囱工期缩短到十四天后，二号平炉烟囱又缩短为十二天，兄弟单位更有比我们快的。谁说发展已经到顶，不会再前进了呢？两年的伟大实践增强了我们的信心，我们要高高举起高速优质大跃进的红旗，乘胜前进！
