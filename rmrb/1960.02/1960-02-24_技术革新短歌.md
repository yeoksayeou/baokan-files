    Technical Innovation Short Songs
        Sand Delivery of Three Generations
    Grandpa was a sand delivery worker,
    He used a carrying pole with sand buckets.
    The sand buckets were heavy and hollow,
    His waist was bent and his shoulders were swollen.
    Taking a break was difficult,
    The whip behind him didn't loosen.
    Dad was also a sand delivery worker,
    He used a small cart to push sand buckets.
    The platform slope was high and steep,
    The labor intensity was also very heavy.
    The secretary often helped him pull the cart,
    Showing more care than a brother!
    I am also a sand delivery worker,
    Carrying pole and small cart are no longer needed.
    I made a big splash in the technical performance competition,
    Wind-powered sand delivery has been successful.
    The wind blows the sand like flowing water,
    Efficiency has increased three times.
    My family has been delivering sand for three generations,
    The experiences of the three generations are completely different,
    Dad's eyes are full of tears,
    Speaking his heartfelt feelings word by word:
    "The care comes from the Communist Party,
    A thousand thanks to Mao Zedong!"	  Song Huaifu, Stoker of Beijing Nankou Locomotive Depot
      Secretary
    The waning moon still lingers on the treetops,
    But the morning light has already shone through the window.
    I walk into the Party branch secretary's bedroom,
    And see him leaning over the desk.
    A compass is held tightly in his hand,
    Innovation drawings are spread out on the desk,
    The cigarette butts in the ashtray have just been extinguished,
    A glass of water hasn't cooled down yet.
    I pick up the coat that slipped onto the floor,
    And gently put it on the secretary;
    Then stoke the fire,
    And tiptoe out, closing the door behind me.
    The waning moon still lingers on the treetops,
    But the morning light has already shone through the window.
    I get on my bicycle and head straight for the machine room,
    I'm also going to make a big effort in technical innovation.	Hua Zhen, Hongqi (Red Flag) Reservoir, Hulin, Heilongjiang
      “Rehearsing a Play”
    In the middle of the night,
    The old man returned home in the dark.
    His wife pretended to be angry:
    "What, rehearsing a play again today?"
    "Didn't I say long ago,
    There's still a bit that hasn't been rehearsed yet!"
    "It's done! It's done!"
    A young man ran in and took over the conversation.
    The old man quickly signaled to the young man with his mouth,
    But the young man was so excited that he kept saying:
    "The new type of plow you reformed,
    Has passed the technical station's inspection!"
    The cooperative director sent a good news report,
    The secretary also came to congratulate him:
    "You fired the first shot in agricultural tool reform,
    Making a great contribution to our commune's spring plowing."
    The old woman offered her opinion from the side,
    Saying that the old man was a bit "conservative":
    "Why did you hide things from me?
    And lied saying you were rehearsing a play!"
          Xiao Yunquan, Tangshan, Hebei

    技术革新短歌
        三代给沙工
    爷爷是个给沙工，
    他用扁担挑沙桶。
    沙桶沉重肚内空，
    腰被压弯肩压肿。
    寸步难行缓口气，
    背后皮鞭不放松。
    爸爸也是给沙工，
    他用小车推沙桶。
    ?台斜坡高又陡，
    劳动强度也很重。
    书记常帮他拉车，
    问寒问暖胜弟兄！
    我也是个给沙工，
    扁担小车全不用。
    大闹技术表演赛，
    风力给沙已成功。
    风吹沙动似流水，
    效率提高三倍整。
    我家三代给沙工，
    三代遭遇全不同，
    爸爸满眼含热泪，
    一字一句叙衷情：
    “关怀来自共产党，
    千恩万谢毛泽东！”	  北京南口机务段司炉　宋怀富
      书记
    残月还依恋着树梢，
    晨光却已经透进玻璃窗。
    我走进支部书记卧室，
    看见他正伏在桌上。
    圆规紧紧握在手里，
    革新图样摊在桌上，
    烟缸里的烟头刚刚熄灭，
    一杯开水还没变凉。
    我拣起溜在地下的外套，
    轻轻给书记披上；
    再把炉火烧旺，
    踮起脚尖儿走出来把门带上。
    残月还依恋着树梢，
    晨光却已经透进玻璃窗。
    骑上脚踏车我直奔机器房，
    技术革新我也来大干一场。	黑龙江虎林东方红水库　骅臻
      “排戏”
    半夜三更天，
    大爷摸黑回到家里。
    老伴装生气：
    “怎么，今天又是排戏？”
    “不早就说吗，
    还有一点没排成呢！”
    “成了！成了！”
    一个小伙子跑进来把话接了过去。
    大爷忙向小伙子鼓嘴示意，
    小伙子可兴奋得直说下去：
    “您改革的那部新式犁，
    技术站检查合格了哩！”
    社长送来喜报，
    书记也来道喜：
    “您打响了农具改革头一炮，
    给咱们公社春耕出了大力。”
    老伴一旁把意见提，
    说大爷有点“保守主义”：
    “有事为啥瞒着我？
    还撒谎说去排戏！”
          河北唐山　萧允全
