Some Experiences in My Amateur Creative Work
Soldier Zhang Yongtai

    I have loved drawing since I was a child, but it was really after I joined the army that I was able to paint a few strokes.

    In 1958, I gloriously enlisted in the army. That year, the people of the whole country launched a vigorous Great Leap Forward movement. New people, new events, and new records flew like snowflakes. New records were broken one after another, and reports of good news, comparisons, on-site meetings, and so on came one after another. This required various charts, propaganda posters, and exhibitions to exchange and promote new experiences. When the organization discovered that I had some expertise in fine arts, it promptly encouraged and educated me, allowing me to use painting to serve propaganda work and the Great Leap Forward. When I improved in my painting skills, the organization sounded the alarm of "arrogance is dangerous." So I deeply realized that relying on the leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in learning. Thanks to the Party's education, I received a third-class merit in 1958, was rated as a Leap Forward pacesetter, and was also rated as a five-good soldier in the first half of 1959. In terms of creation, in 1959 alone, I painted more than two hundred paintings for publications inside and outside the army. Among them were illustrations, comic strips, and single paintings. Recently, the organization sent me to study again. With the help of comrades, I have learned a lot of things. I realize that painting techniques are complex, but not mysterious. As long as you study hard and practice diligently, you can master them. I couldn't draw well at the beginning. I didn't understand proportion, perspective, anatomy, emptiness and reality, warm and cold colors at all, and the accuracy of the shape was even worse. What should I do? I seized all the spare time to enrich myself with theory, and then consolidate the knowledge I learned from books in practice. I didn't rest on holidays, and I took my sketchbook everywhere to draw, so my skills slowly improved.

    Looking at other people's paintings can increase your knowledge and broaden your horizons. But just looking is not enough. You also need to analyze and study. In addition to analyzing the brushwork and coloring of a painting, you also need to consider how others express the theme. If you were to paint it yourself, how should you express it? You should also ask others for advice on your own paintings and solicit the opinions of comrades to improve the quality of your work.

    Of course, to improve the quality of your work, you must first live in the ranks of the masses' struggle. If you just sit in the house and think, you can't think of anything. Only by joining the masses' Leap Forward upsurge can you keep up with the development of the situation, can you understand it deeply, and can you draw healthy things. Soldiers are the main object of our expression, so we must be familiar with the soldier's character, life, thoughts, and other aspects. Because amateur authors use their spare time for creation, they must first do a good job in their duties. They must also strengthen their political and theoretical studies, pay more attention to politics, and read more newspapers and periodicals. We must prevent purely technical viewpoints, proceed from the overall interests, and let ourselves and our brushes become docile tools of the Party.

    我在业余创作中的一些体会
    战士　张永太
    我从小就喜欢画画，但是真正能画几笔画还是入伍以后的事。
    1958年我光荣应征入伍，这一年全国人民展开了轰轰烈烈的大跃进运动。新人新事、新纪录像雪片一样满天飞舞。一个个新纪录都被突破了，报喜、评比、现场会议等等接连而来，这就需要各种图表、宣传画和展览会等形式来交流和推广新的经验。当组织上发现我在美术方面有点专长时，就及时地鼓励和教育我，让我用绘画为宣传工作和大跃进服务。当我在绘画技术上有些提高时，组织上又给我敲响了“骄傲危险”的警钟。所以我深深体会到：依靠党的领导，是搞好学习的根本保证。由于党的教育，我在1958年立了一次三等功，评了一次跃进标兵，1959年上半年还被评为五好战士。在创作上，仅1959年就为军内外刊物画了二百多幅画。其中有插图、连环画和单幅画。最近组织上又送我去学习，在同志们的帮助下，我又学到了好多东西。我认识到画画的技术是复杂的，但并不神秘，只要勤学苦练就能掌握。我一开始也画不好，比例、透视、解剖、虚实、冷暖一点也不懂，形的准确性就更差了。怎么办呢？我就抓紧一切空隙时间从理论上来充实自己，再从实践中去巩固这些从书本上学来的知识，假日我都不休息，拿着速写本到处画，这样技术就慢慢提高了。
    多看别人的画能增加自己的知识，开阔眼界。但是光看还不够，还需要进行分析研究。一幅画除分析它的笔法着色等外，还要推敲人家是怎样来表现这个主题的，若自己来画，应该怎样表现它；自己画的画也要多请别人指教，多征求同志们的意见才能提高自己的作品质量。
    当然，要提高作品的质量，首先是自己要生活在群众斗争的行列里。如果光坐在屋子里想，是想不出东西来的。只有加入群众的跃进浪潮里，才能跟上形势的发展，才能体会得深刻，才能画出健康的东西来。战士是我们表现的主要对象，所以就要熟悉战士的性格、生活、思想等各方面的情况。因为业余作者是利用业余时间进行创作的，所以必须先搞好职责之内的工作，平时还要加强政治理论学习，多关心政治，多看报纸刊物，一定要防止单纯的技术观点，要从整体利益出发，让自己和自己的画笔成为党的驯服的工具。
