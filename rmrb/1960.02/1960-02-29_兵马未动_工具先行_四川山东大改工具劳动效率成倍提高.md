Tools First Before Troops Move
Sichuan and Shandong Greatly Improve Tools, Labor Efficiency Doubles

    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, February 27th: The in-depth development of the tool reform and technological innovation movement in rural Sichuan has powerfully promoted spring production.
    This year, the sown area of various crops in Sichuan Province will be greatly increased compared to last year, and the technical specifications requirements are also higher than in previous years. To this end, various localities have focused on transportation, cultivation, irrigation and drainage, and processing, which are the most labor-intensive and seasonal, and vigorously carried out tool reform and technological innovation movements. At present, the province has promoted more than 6.8 million pieces of various semi-mechanized farm implements and improved farm implements, which has doubled labor efficiency. After Lezhi County promoted 150,000 pieces of improved tools, it was equivalent to adding 40,000 laborers.
    Mianyang Prefecture has vigorously engaged in a "one-dragon" wheat tool reform, manufacturing 200,000 wheat sowing machines, 10,000 tamping stone rollers, 60,000 irrigation vehicles, 50,000 harvesters, and 37,000 threshers. The spring production mainly focused on wheat in the entire prefecture can save more than 400 million labor days.
    The province's tool reform and technological innovation movement has further spread from agriculture to animal husbandry, fishery, and living welfare.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, February 28th: People's communes in Shandong Province are vigorously overhauling, improving, manufacturing, and promoting new-style tools around spring production. According to statistics, from January to now, the province has manufactured and repaired more than 2.1 million pieces of farming, sowing, transportation, and water lifting tools. Shouguang, Zhucheng and other 20 counties have realized transportation vehicle mechanization.
    In the spirit of "tools first before troops move," Shandong Province conducted a comprehensive tool inspection, evaluation, and appraisal at all levels as early as last winter, followed by a mass tool reform movement. After the completion of the comprehensive inspection in Liaocheng Prefecture, it quickly organized iron and wood workers, some to repair large tools and manufacture new tools in the factory; and some carried red stoves, divided into groups, and used the methods of setting up points, setting up stations, delivering goods to the door, and contracting by area to go deep into the communes and teams to repair and reform farm implements on a tour. At present, the task of repairing 400,000 pieces of spring production tools originally scheduled in this prefecture has been fully completed; and 700,000 pieces of various small farm implements have been manufactured and reformed.
    All localities have paid attention to overcoming weak links and grasping promotion work in tool reform. In the past, Shandong had fewer tools suitable for dibbling. This year, cotton, corn, and peanut dibblers or dibbling drills were created and promoted in a timely manner.

    兵马未动　工具先行
    四川山东大改工具劳动效率成倍提高
    据新华社成都27日电　四川农村工具改革和技术革新运动的深入发展，有力地推动了春季生产。
    今年四川省各项作物播种面积将比去年大大增加，技术规格要求也比往年提高。为此，各地抓住了费工最多、季节性较强的运输、耕作、排灌、加工等作为重点，大力开展工具改革和技术革新运动。现在，全省已经推广的各种半机械化农具和改良农具达六百八十多万件，使劳动效率成倍地提高。乐至县推广了十五万件改良工具后，就等于增加了四万个劳动力。
    绵阳专区大搞小麦工具改革“一条龙”，制造出小麦播种机二十万部，镇压石磙一万部，浇灌车六万部，收割机五万部，脱粒机三万七千部，全专区以小麦为主的小春生产就可节约四亿多个劳动日。
    全省工具改革和技术革新运动还由农业进一步普及到畜牧业、渔业和生活福利等各个方面。
    据新华社济南28日电　山东省各地人民公社围绕春季生产，大力检修、改良、制造、推广新式工具。据统计，从1月到现在，全省赶制、修理的耕播、运输、提水等工具已有二百一十多万件。寿光、诸城等二十个县已经实现了运输车子化。
    山东省各地本着“兵马未动，工具先行”的精神，早在去年冬季就层层开展了工具普查、评选、鉴定工作，紧接着又开展了群众性的工具改革运动。聊城专区普查结束后，迅速组织铁、木工人，一部分在厂内修理大型工具和制造新工具；一部分携带红炉，分成小组，用设点、设站、送货到门和分片包干的办法，深入社队巡回修理、改革农具。现在，这个专区原订修理四十万件春季生产工具的任务，已经全部完成；并结合制造、改革各种小农具七十万件。
    各地在工具改革中都注意克服薄弱环节和抓推广工作。过去，山东适宜点播的工具较少，今年创制了棉花、玉米、花生点播机或点播耧，并及时推广。
