Inner Mongolia Holds Scientific Discussion Meeting
Discussing the Nature of the Supply System Portion of the Commune Distribution System

The Inner Mongolia Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Inner Mongolia University recently jointly held their first scientific discussion meeting. The discussion meeting included two major parts: natural sciences and social sciences. The social sciences part included five sub-groups: Marxist-Leninist theory, Chinese language and literature, Mongolian language and literature, history, and foreign languages. The following are the main issues discussed by the Marxist-Leninist theory sub-group and the history sub-group.

The papers submitted for discussion by the Marxist-Leninist theory sub-group focused on China's current socialist construction. The meeting discussed the nature of the supply portion of the people's commune distribution system. Some comrades believed that the supply portion only had elements of distribution according to need and, in its nature, was still distribution according to labor, because those with labor power must complete a certain number of workdays to enjoy the supply. Other comrades pointed out that analyzing the nature of the supply portion requires first clarifying whether the standard is labor or need. Obviously, the supply portion of the people's commune is not based on labor, but is basically based on need. As for those with labor power having to obtain a certain number of basic workdays to enjoy the supply portion's treatment, this only shows that today's distribution according to need is still in its infancy and differs from distribution according to need in the communist era; "each according to his ability" cannot be fully relied upon on conscientiousness today. However, labor is not the standard of distribution here, so it cannot be said to be distribution according to labor.

The papers submitted for discussion by the history sub-group focused on how to clarify that China is a unified multi-ethnic country. Many different opinions were raised on Zhu Baoshan's "A Tentative Discussion on the Nature of the War between the Han and the Xiongnu during the Western Han Dynasty, and a Critique of Emperor Wu of Han's War against the Xiongnu," and there was a fierce debate. The focus of the debate was whether the war between the Han and the Xiongnu was a domestic issue or a foreign issue, and whether Emperor Wu's war against the Xiongnu was a just war or an unjust war. Comrade Ma Changshou put forward fundamentally different arguments from Comrade Zhu Baoshan. Comrade Ma Changshou believed that the Han and the Xiongnu was not a domestic issue, but a foreign issue, a problem between countries; the essence of the contradiction between the Han and the Xiongnu was the contradiction between two systems, namely the feudal system and the slave system, and here we must pay attention to the difference between the advanced and the backward; Emperor Wu of Han's attack on the Xiongnu protected the country's production and was therefore in the interests of the people. This actually involved the formation of China's unified nation-state.

Comrade Shi Yun believed that all ethnic issues and the relationships between ethnic groups that have existed in history within the territory of China today are issues in our history, internal issues. Our existing unified multi-ethnic country was gradually formed by many tribes and tribal groups in the process of long-term historical development. Today, all ethnic groups in China are still developing and integrating, and the differences between ethnic groups will disappear in the future. Ethnic groups in history have various possibilities for development. The law of our country's history is that many historical ethnic groups gradually formed a unified multi-ethnic country, which is the mainstream of our country's history. Only individual ethnic groups formed independent countries under specific historical conditions. In this long historical development process, the basic relationship between all ethnic groups in China is an "inseparable" relationship. People of all ethnic groups cannot do without each other in terms of politics, economy, and culture. There is also a "can't stand" side. People of all ethnic groups "can't stand" the reactionary rulers of all ethnic groups, and some of the estrangement between ethnic groups is also caused by the reactionary rulers. In our country's history, there have also been "countries" of ethnic minorities, such as the Later Jin Khanate, but this should also be separated from the general concept of "country" and should not be confused.

    内蒙古举行科学讨论会
    讨论公社分配制度中供给制部分的性质等问题
    中国科学院内蒙古分院和内蒙古大学不久以前联合举办了第一次科学讨论会。讨论会包括自然科学和社会科学两大部分。参加社会科学部分讨论的有马克思列宁主义理论、汉语言文学、蒙古语言文学、历史学和外国语言学等五个分会，下面是马克思列宁主义理论分会和历史学分会讨论的主要问题。
    马克思列宁主义理论分会提交讨论的论文，是以我国当前社会主义建设为中心的。会上讨论了人民公社分配制度中供给部分的性质问题。有些同志认为供给部分只有按需分配的因素，就其性质来说，仍是按劳分配，因为有劳动力的人必须做满一定的劳动日才能享受供给。另一部分同志指出，分析供给部分的性质，首先须要弄清楚是以劳动为尺度还是以需要为尺度。很显然，人民公社的供给部分并不是以劳动为尺度，而是基本上以需要为尺度。至于有劳动力的人必须取得一定的基本劳动日才能享受供给部分的待遇，这只是说明今天的按需分配还只是萌芽性质，它还不同于共产主义时期的按需分配；“各尽所能”在今天还不能完全依靠自觉。但是，劳动在这里并不是分配的尺度，所以不能说是按劳分配。
    历史学分会提交讨论的论文，中心问题是如何阐明我国是统一的多民族国家。对于朱葆珊的“试论西汉时期汉与匈奴战争的性质，并评汉武帝对匈奴的战争”一文，大家提出许多不同的意见，进行了激烈的争辩。争论的中心点是汉与匈奴的战争是国内问题还是国外问题，武帝对匈奴战争是正义的战争还是非正义的战争。马长寿同志提出了与朱葆珊同志基本上不同的论点。马长寿同志认为汉与匈奴不是国内问题，而是国外问题，国与国之间的问题；汉与匈奴的矛盾本质是两种制度，即封建制与奴隶制的矛盾，这里便要注意先进和落后的差别；汉武帝打匈奴的结果，保护了本国的生产，因此是符合人民利益的。这实际上已经牵涉到了中国统一的民族国家形成问题。
    史筠同志认为凡是在今天中国境内曾经存在的历史上的一切民族问题及各民族之间的关系问题都是我国历史上的问题，是内部问题，我们现有的统一的多民族国家是在长期历史发展的过程中由很多部落、部族逐步形成的。今天的中国各民族还正在向前发展、融合，将来民族间的差别是要消失的。历史上的民族有种种发展的可能性。我国历史的规律是很多历史上的民族逐渐形成为一个统一的多民族国家，这是我国历史的主流。只有个别的民族在特定的历史条件下形成为独立的国家。在这个长期的历史发展过程中，中国各民族的基本关系是“离不得”的关系，各族人民在政治、经济、文化方面都彼此离不开。也有“见不得”的一面，各族人民对各族反动统治者都“见不得”，民族之间的某些隔膜也是反动统治者所造成的。在我国历史上也出现过少数民族的“国家”，如后金汗国等，但这也要和一般“国家”的概念分开，不应混为一谈。
