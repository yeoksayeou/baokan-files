Harbin, February 20th (from our newspaper) – Service personnel at many street-level life service stations in Harbin are using discarded materials to create simple washing machines, transforming hand washing into semi-mechanized washing, which improves labor efficiency. One washing machine can wash as much laundry in an hour (with one person cranking it) as one person can wash by hand in a day. Now, thousands of street-level life service stations, nurseries, and life welfare departments of some factories, government offices, and schools throughout Harbin are enthusiastically promoting washing machines.

The simple washing machines that have been produced in Harbin include small hand-cranked wooden washing machines, hand-cranked iron washing machines, and electric washing machines. There are also foot-pedal spin dryers for wringing out clothes, electric spin dryers, and foot-pedal clothes-scrubbing machines. The simple wooden hand-cranked washing machine made by service personnel at the Chunhua Street No. 2 Workers' Building Life Service Station in Daowai District uses triangular wooden strips to nail together a cylindrical washboard with gaps around it, which is then encased in a wooden bucket-like shell. This is mounted on a wooden frame, and there is a square opening on the top of the shell. Clothes are placed into the cylinder through this opening, and the bucket is filled with soapy water or alkaline water. By holding the crank and turning the cylindrical washboard, turning it a few times forward and then a few times backward, the clothes are continuously rubbed and washed as the cylindrical washboard rotates back and forth. It can wash thirty pieces of clothing at a time in just twenty minutes. The foot-pedal spin dryer made of galvanized iron by the Youzheng Street First Life Service Station in Nangang District allows you to put the sopping wet washed clothes inside, and then step on the pedal to rotate the iron bucket to remove the water. In the past, this service station used three people to wring out large cotton-padded coats, and they still couldn't get them dry enough. Because of the mechanized washing and spin-drying, more laundry can be washed and it dries faster. Clothes sent for washing in the morning can be picked up in the afternoon. With washing machines and spin dryers, not only is physical labor reduced, but efficiency is also improved, and the quality of washing is cleaner than hand washing.

### 用人少  洗的多　干的快  哈尔滨实现洗衣机械化

    用人少  洗的多　干的快
    哈尔滨实现洗衣机械化
    本报哈尔滨20日电　哈尔滨市很多街道生活服务站的服务人员，利用废旧物资创制简易洗衣机，使手工洗衣变为半机械化，提高了劳动效率。一台洗衣机一小时的洗衣量（一个人摇动），就等于一个人手工劳动一天所洗的衣服。现在，遍布哈尔滨市的几千个街道生活服务站、托儿所以及一些工厂、机关、学校的生活福利部门，都在大搞洗衣机。
    哈尔滨市已经制出的简易洗衣机，有木制手摇小型洗衣机、手摇铁制洗衣机和电动洗衣机，还有拧干的脚蹬甩水机，电动甩水机和刷洗衣服的脚蹬刷衣机等。道外区纯化街二号职工大楼的生活服务站服务人员制做的简易木制手摇洗衣机，是用三棱形木条钉成一个周围有缝隙的圆筒形搓板，外面套上一个木桶式的外壳，架在木架上，外壳上面有个方形洞口，从这个洞口把衣服放进圆筒里，桶内装有肥皂水或碱水，因此用手握着摇把，摇动圆筒搓板，正转几下，反转几下，随着圆筒搓板不断的正反转动，衣服就不断的反复揉搓冲洗，一次可洗三十件衣服，只用二十分钟。南岗区邮政街第一生活服务站用白铁皮制做的脚蹬甩水机，把洗好的水淋淋的衣服放到里面，脚蹬摇把，铁桶旋转脱水。过去这个服务站洗大棉袄，三个人拧水都拧不净。因为有了机器洗衣，甩水，洗的多，干得快，上午送衣来洗，下午就可拿回去。有了洗衣机、甩水机，不但减轻了体力劳动，而且效率提高了，洗衣的质量比手洗的也干净。
