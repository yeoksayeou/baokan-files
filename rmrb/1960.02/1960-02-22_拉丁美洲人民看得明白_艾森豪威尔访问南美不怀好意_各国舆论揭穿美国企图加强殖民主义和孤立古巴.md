Comprehensive report by our newspaper: U.S. President Eisenhower will depart on February 22nd to visit four Latin American countries: Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. On the eve of the visit, newspapers in various Latin American countries published commentaries, exposing that Eisenhower's purpose is to obstruct the struggle of Latin American countries against U.S. imperialism and to defend national independence, and to conspire to isolate and further interfere with Cuba.

The Cuban newspaper "Hoy" published a Washington dispatch on February 20th in a prominent position, stating that Eisenhower's visit to Latin America aims to isolate the Cuban Castro government and create favorable conditions for the U.S. aggression plan against the Cuban revolution. "Hoy" said that this aggression plan also includes economic sabotage, using Trujillo and his mercenaries, and playing diplomatic conspiracies within the Organization of American States. The newspaper, in exposing the U.S. attempt to interfere in Cuba through the Organization of American States, pointed out that because Venezuela has already condemned Trujillo's terrorist persecution in the Organization of American States, the United States is trying to use this as a precedent for its interference, in order to hand over the powers that it failed to fully obtain at the Santiago Foreign Ministers Conference to the Peace Committee of the Organization of American States. The newspaper also drew attention to the recent remarks of Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Rubottom, who expressed doubts about whether the Cuban revolutionary government is a "representative democracy." In this way, they can mobilize the Organization of American States to oppose Cuba.

The newspaper emphasized that the imperialists are bound to be greatly disappointed, because, as the recent trade agreement between Cuba and the Soviet Union proves, the imperialists cannot besiege Cuba with hunger, nor can they force Cuba to submit with military force.

The Cuban "Revolución" newspaper exposed the hypocrisy of the so-called U.S. "aid" in a commentary. It said that the so-called "aid" provided by the United States is not for the benefit of all American countries, but for Wall Street itself.

The newspaper pointed out that Eisenhower will make some remarks during his visit expressing his intention to aid Latin American countries, which has been decided by the situation in Cuba. "Revolución" said that the United States acts as if the hungry people of Latin America do not know what they should do in order not to starve to death. Washington announces that Eisenhower will see what our countries need during his visit, and then return home to study how to carry out the necessary work.

The newspaper emphasized that the Latin American people have already seen how fast Castro has been able to advance what he has done in Cuba without "U.S. aid." Cuba's determination to change its life should be regarded as a consistent program and determination of the entire Latin America.

"Combate" also published an editorial saying that the Cuban people have seen who their enemies and friends are. The newspaper pointed out that Cuba's enemy is in Washington. Friendship can only be expected from those governments that are not based on exploiting the people of other countries. The Cuban people have received a hand of friendship extended by the people of a country through Mikoyan's visit. This country neither demands the slightest damage to our sovereignty and self-determination, nor puts forward conditions that hinder the full development of our national economy.

The Peruvian Communist Party's newspaper "Unidad" recently published an editorial saying that Eisenhower's visit to South America is obviously aimed at strengthening colonialism.

The editorial said that although the spokesperson of the U.S. State Department advertised that this visit was for "peace, friendship, and freedom," many people believe that this visit has the same meaning as Mr. Nixon's memorable and regrettable visit.

The editorial emphasized that although the United States shouts for peace, it has not changed its colonial policy on many issues related to peace, such as national independence, national self-determination, and the material and cultural progress of all peoples. The editorial said, "In Latin America, especially in Peru, we are suffering from huge economic aggression, which is basically determined by the requirements of the International Monetary Fund."

The editorial firmly demanded that the United States "stop the slanderous and provocative propaganda against Cuba, that the American aggressors withdraw their claws from Cuba and the entire Latin America, and abolish the missions of American military and 'technical' personnel and various experts." The editorial demanded that the FBI and McCarthyists in any disguise get out of Latin American countries, and that the treaties of "defense of the continent" and "military aid" that are not worthy of their names be abolished, and that American diplomats and rulers stop supporting brutal dictatorial regimes.

The Uruguayan newspaper "El Popular" recently published an article on Eisenhower's upcoming visit to South America, stating that the opposition between U.S. imperialism and Latin American countries is fundamental.

The article pointed out that the purpose of Eisenhower's visit is to "repair the U.S. front in Latin America and obstruct our countries from implementing a completely independent and autonomous foreign policy based on our true interests and in defending world peace. The U.S. goals are incompatible with this deep-seated desire of the Latin American people."

The article pointed out that Eisenhower's attempt to obstruct trade between Latin America and socialist countries, states that the trend of Latin America demanding to develop trade with socialist countries "is developing powerfully, because it meets the wishes and interests of our countries."

    拉丁美洲人民看得明白
    艾森豪威尔访问南美不怀好意
    各国舆论揭穿美国企图加强殖民主义和孤立古巴
    本报综合报道　美国总统艾森豪威尔将在2月22日启程去巴西、阿根廷、智利、乌拉圭四个拉丁美洲国家访问。在访问的前夕，拉丁美洲各国报纸纷纷发表评论，揭露艾森豪威尔此行的目的是要阻挠拉丁美洲各国反对美帝国主义、保卫民族独立的斗争，并阴谋孤立和进一步干涉古巴。
    古巴“今日报”2月20日以显著的地位刊载了华盛顿的消息说，艾森豪威尔访问拉丁美洲的目的是要孤立古巴卡斯特罗政府，并为美国反对古巴革命的侵略计划制造有利条件。“今日报”说，这个侵略计划还包括经济破坏，利用特鲁希略及其雇佣军，以及在美洲国家组织内玩弄外交阴谋。报纸在揭露美国企图通过美洲国家组织对古巴进行干涉的阴谋时指出，由于委内瑞拉已经在美洲国家组织中对特鲁希略的恐怖迫害提出了谴责，美国企图利用这一点来作为它进行干涉的先例，以便把圣地亚哥外长会议上所未能完全得到的权力交给美洲国家组织的和平委员会。报纸还提请人们注意负责美洲事务的助理国务卿鲁博特姆最近的谈话，鲁博特姆在谈话中对古巴革命政府是不是“代议制民主”的政府表示怀疑。这样一来，他们就可以发动美洲国家组织这个机构来反对古巴。
    报纸强调指出，帝国主义一定要大失所望，因为，正像最近古巴和苏联签订的贸易协定所证明的那样，帝国主义者无法用饥饿来包围古巴，他们也不能用军事力量来使古巴屈膝。
    古巴“国民日报”在一篇评论中揭露了所谓美国“援助”的虚伪性。它说，美国进行的所谓“援助”不是为了所有美洲国家的利益，而是为华尔街自己。
    这家报纸指出，艾森豪威尔在访问期间将会发表一些表示要援助拉丁美洲国家的谈话，这是古巴的局势已经决定了的。“国民日报”说，美国好像拉丁美洲饥饿的人民不知道为了不致饿死，他们应该做些什么似的，华盛顿宣布说什么艾森豪威尔在访问期间将看看我们这些国家需要什么，然后回国再研究将如何进行必要的工作。
    这家报纸强调指出，拉丁美洲人民已经看到，卡斯特罗在古巴没有“美援”的情况下能够以怎样的速度把他所做的事推向前进。古巴改变它的生活的决心应该看作是整个拉丁美洲一致的纲领和决心。
    “战斗报”也发表社论说，古巴人民已经看出谁是他们的敌人和朋友。报纸指出，古巴的敌人在华盛顿。只有对那些不以剥削其他国家人民为基础的政府才可以指望友好。古巴人民通过米高扬的访问得到了一个国家的人民所伸出的友谊的手。这个国家既不要求丝毫损害我国主权和自决权，也不提出妨碍我国国民经济充分发展的条件。
    秘鲁共产党机关报“团结报”最近发表了一篇社论说，艾森豪威尔访问南美的目的显然是为了加强殖民主义。
    社论说，尽管美国国务院的发言人宣传说这次访问是为了“和平、友谊与自由”，但是许多人认为，这次访问与记忆犹新的尼克松先生可悲的访问具有同样的意义。
    社论强调指出，尽管美国高喊和平，但是它在民族独立、民族自决权、各国人民的物质文化进步等许多同和平有关的问题上并没有改变它的殖民政策。社论说，“在拉丁美洲，特别是在秘鲁，我们遭受着基本上是由国际货币基金组织的要求决定的巨大的经济侵略。”
    社论坚决要求美国“停止对古巴的诽谤和挑衅宣传，美国侵略者从古巴和整个拉丁美洲缩回他们的魔爪，取消美国的军事、‘技术’人员和形形色色的专家的使团”。社论要求联邦调查局和披着任何外衣的麦卡锡主义者从拉丁美洲各国滚出去，并且废除名不符实的“保卫大陆”的条约和“军事援助”条约，美国的外交家和执政者停止支持残暴的独裁政权。
    乌拉圭“人民报”最近就艾森豪威尔即将访问南美一事发表文章说，美帝国主义和拉丁美洲各国之间的对立是根本性的。
    文章指出，艾森豪威尔访问的目的是企图把美国在“拉丁美洲的阵线重新修补起来，并且阻挠我们各国在自己真正利益的基础上和在保卫世界和平方面执行完全独立和自主的对外政策。美国的目的与拉丁美洲人民的这种深切愿望是水火不相容的”。
    文章在谈到艾森豪威尔企图阻挠拉丁美洲同社会主义国家之间的贸易时指出，拉丁美洲要求同社会主义国家发展贸易的潮流“正在强大地发展起来，因为它符合我们各个国家的愿望和利益”。
