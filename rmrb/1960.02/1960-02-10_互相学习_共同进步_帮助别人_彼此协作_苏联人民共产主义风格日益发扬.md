Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th. (By our correspondent Li Nan) In the year and more since the comprehensive unfolding of communist construction, the communist ideology of the Soviet people has been significantly enhanced. On all construction fronts, the spirit of learning from each other, making progress together, helping others, and cooperating with each other has been greatly developed, becoming an important source of strength for the Soviet people to achieve great accomplishments.

	The Spark of Communist Labor Brigades Spreads Throughout the Country

In the past year or so, many mass movements full of communist spirit have emerged in the Soviet Union. The spark of the "Communist Labor Brigade" that erupted at the Moscow-Ryazan railway marshalling station has now spread throughout the country. Associated with it is the "Communist Shock Worker" movement initiated by workers at the "Red Presnya" factory in Moscow. Currently, nearly 200,000 work teams across the country are participating in the competition to win the title of "Communist Labor Brigade," and about 300,000 people are participating in the "Communist Shock Worker" movement. Participants in these movements and work teams all require themselves to "work, study, and live in the spirit of communism." The requirement of "everyone for one, one for everyone" for common progress is consistently implemented in their actions.

Following these two movements, the Soviet Union saw the emergence of the "Advanced Helping the Backward" movement initiated by the famous female textile worker Gaganova. Over the past year, hundreds of thousands of people across the Soviet Union have responded to this call. They voluntarily go to work in backward areas or backward production units without regard to personal compensation, helping to raise backward areas or units to advanced levels. Thus, this movement has become an important force inspiring people to help each other and make progress together, and has played a significant role in promoting production and conducting ideological education for the masses. Taking Gaganova's factory as an example, as a result of the general improvement of backward work teams, the factory's equipment utilization rate has now reached the 1965 level stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan.

	The Wind of Communist Collaboration is Developing Daily

With the development of the "Advanced Helping the Backward" movement, a communist atmosphere of collaboration and mutual assistance between factories, and between factories and collective farms, has emerged in various parts of the Soviet Union. For example, the Dzerzhinsky Machine Building Factory in the Perm National Economic Region is a large, advanced factory. Near it is a small factory with a weaker technical foundation. The Dzerzhinsky factory took the initiative to help this factory develop a plan for implementing production automation and mechanization, and sent experts to help implement the plan. Enterprises in the Kiev Oblast are all looking for unused timber, metal, steel pipes, and other materials in their own factories for collective farms to use. Factories in this oblast also helped collective farms throughout the oblast establish 244 workshops and studios. Not long ago, factory enterprises in the Kiev Oblast launched an initiative to send engineers to work on collective farms. Factories have collectively sent 160 engineers to work on collective farms.

In the past year or so, the communist spirit of collaboration between Soviet workers, technicians, and scientific researchers has also been promoted more than in the past. For example, in order to help the Moscow First Ball Bearing Factory achieve comprehensive automation, the Soviet Academy of Sciences established a comprehensive laboratory in the factory led by Dr. P.G., Deputy Director of the Institute of Machines, with personnel from the Institute of Machines, Automation, Economics, Electronics, and factory employees participating.

	Experts in All Walks of Life Help the Masses Without Remuneration

Under the influence of promoting the communist style, people in all walks of life are planning how to do their best to help others. Teachers at the Rostov Higher Medical School initiated the initiative to see patients and help young doctors during their teaching spare time. This initiative was quickly responded to and promoted throughout the country. In Omsk, some famous medical experts, like Academician Savinykh, Professor Yakovlev, and Professor Cherenin, receive patients in their spare time without any remuneration, and often go deep into various districts to treat diseases for residents. Famous professors from the famous First Medical College of Moscow regularly receive patients in the Frunze District, Dzerzhinsky District, Kiev District, and Sverdlovsk District. Experts from the Sukhumi Medical College of the Georgian Republic have also established comprehensive work teams that frequently go to the countryside to help rural doctors improve their professional skills and treat illnesses.

Engineering and technical personnel, teachers and students of universities and colleges, and scientific personnel of scientific research institutes are also promoting the spirit of helping others, using their spare time to help industrial workers improve their cultural and technical levels, and help workers preparing for further studies prepare for their lessons. For example, the initiative launched by Moscow Likhachev Automobile Factory engineer Pronkin to help workers improve their cultural and technical levels quickly received enthusiastic responses from technicians in many enterprises. In Irkutsk, students from Irkutsk University took the initiative to help 400 young people preparing to study at universities and colleges prepare for their lessons. Artists and scholars all help others with the spirit of actively helping people. Scholars from more than one regional branch of the Soviet Association for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge have given up the remuneration they should have received according to regulations to give lectures. People's Artist Gogoleva and famous composer Khachaturian and others launched an initiative, suggesting that art groups and artists in various regions actively undertake the glorious task of guiding mass amateur artistic activities.

	The Communist Spirit is Reflected in Life

In the past year, the communist atmosphere among the Soviet people has also been reflected in all aspects of life. For example, the work of people's patrols has been increasingly carried out, and comrade trial meetings have more actively launched struggles against bad phenomena. Many factories have abolished the past system of clocking in and out, but there have been no instances of lateness or early departure. The work team led by Kotelnikova, a female worker at the Moscow Electric Bulb Factory, proposed an initiative advocating that everything, no matter how big or small, should be practiced thrift in all aspects. This initiative also fully demonstrates the workers' communist attitude towards labor and production.

    互相学习  共同进步  帮助别人  彼此协作
    苏联人民共产主义风格日益发扬
    新华社莫斯科7日电　本社记者李楠报道：在全面展开共产主义建设的一年多的时间里，苏联人民群众的共产主义思想有了显著提高。在各个建设战线上，互相学习、共同进步、帮助别人、彼此协作的精神大大发扬，成了苏联人民获得巨大成就的一个重要力量泉源。
    共产主义劳动队的火花遍及全国
    一年多来，苏联出现了不少充满共产主义风格的群众性运动。在莫斯科—梁赞铁路调车站上爆发的“共产主义劳动队”的火花，目前已经遍及全国。同它联系在一起的是，莫斯科“红色普列斯尼亚”工厂工人所倡议的“共产主义突击手”运动。现在，全国已有将近二十万个工作队参加了争取“共产主义劳动队”称号的竞赛运动，约三十万人参加了“共产主义突击手”运动。参加这些运动的人和工作队，都要求自己“按共产主义的精神工作、学习和生活”。“大家为一人，一人为大家”的共同前进的要求，始终贯彻在他们的行动中。
    继这两个运动之后，苏联又出现了由著名纺织女工加干诺娃发起的“先进帮助落后”运动。一年来，苏联全国各地已经有成千上万的人响应这一号召。他们不计个人报酬，自愿到落后地区或者落后生产单位去工作，帮助把落后地区或单位提高到先进水平。这样，这一运动就成了鼓舞人们互相帮助、共同前进的重要力量，并在推动生产和对群众进行思想教育方面起了很大作用。以加干诺娃所在的工厂为例，这个厂由于落后工作队普遍提高的结果，工厂的设备利用率现在已达到七年计划所规定的1965年的水平。
    共产主义协作之风日益发扬
    随着“先进帮助落后”运动的发展，目前苏联各地已兴起了工厂与工厂之间、工厂与集体农庄之间的共产主义协作和互相帮助的风气。例如，白尔姆国民经济区的捷尔任斯基机器制造厂是一个大型先进工厂，在它的附近有一个技术基础较薄弱的小型工厂。捷尔任斯基工厂就主动帮助这个工厂订出实行生产自动化和机械化的计划，并派专家去帮助实现这个计划。基辅州各个企业都在自己的工厂中寻找自己不用的木材、金属、钢管等材料，以供集体农庄使用。这个州的工厂还帮助全州集体农庄建立了二百四十四个工场和作坊。不久以前，基辅州的工厂企业又发起了派工程师到集体农庄去工作的倡议。各个工厂共抽出了一百六十名工程师到集体农庄去工作。
    一年多来，苏联工人、技术人员、科学研究人员之间的共产主义协作风气也比过去发扬了。例如，为了帮助莫斯科第一滚珠轴承工厂实现全面自动化，苏联科学院在这个工厂里成立了以机器研究所副所长皮?格博士担任领导的综合实验室，由机器、自动化、经济、电子学等研究所的人员和工厂职工参加。
    各行各业专家不计报酬帮助群众
    在发扬共产主义风格的影响下，各行各业的人们都在筹划着如何尽自己的力量帮助别人。罗斯托夫市的高等医学校教师发起了利用教学的业余时间接诊病人和帮助青年医生的倡议。这个倡议很快就在全国各地得到响应和推广。在鄂木斯克，一些著名的医学专家，像萨维内赫院士、雅科夫列夫教授、契列宁教授都不收任何报酬在工余接待病人，并且经常深入各个区，为居民治疗疾病。莫斯科有名的第一医学院的著名教授们定期在伏龙芝区、捷尔任斯基区、基辅区、斯维德洛夫斯克区接待病人。格鲁吉亚共和国的苏虎米医学院的专家们还成立了综合工作队，经常到农村去，帮助农村医生提高业务水平和治病。
  工程技术人员、高等学校的师生和科学研究所的科学人员也发扬帮助人的精神，利用工余时间帮助产业工人提高文化技术水平，帮助准备深造的工人准备功课。例如，莫斯科利哈乔夫汽车工厂工程师普隆金发起的帮助工人提高文化技术水平的倡议，很快就得到许多企业的技术人员的热烈响应。在伊尔库次克，伊尔库次克大学的学生主动帮助四百名准备到高等学校深造的青年准备功课。艺术家、学者都本着积极帮助人的精神去帮助别人。苏联政治和科学知识普及协会不止一个地区分会的学者都放弃了依照规定应得的报酬去作演讲报告。人民演员戈戈列娃和著名作曲家哈恰图良等人发起倡议，建议各地艺术团体和艺术家积极承担起辅导群众业余艺术活动的光荣任务。
    共产主义精神表现在生活方面
    一年来，苏联人民群众中的共产主义风气也表现在生活的各个方面。例如人民纠察队的工作日益开展，同志审判会日益积极地展开了对坏现象的斗争。许多工厂取消了过去实行的上工下工工牌制度，但是却没有发生过迟到和早退现象。莫斯科电灯泡制造厂女工科捷尔尼科娃领导的工作队提出倡议，主张事不论大小在一切方面都厉行节约。这个倡议也充分表现了工人们对待劳动、对于生产的共产主义态度。
