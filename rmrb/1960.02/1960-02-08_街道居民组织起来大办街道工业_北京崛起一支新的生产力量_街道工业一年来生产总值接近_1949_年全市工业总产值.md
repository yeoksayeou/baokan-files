    Street Residents Organize to Vigorously Develop Street Industry
    A New Production Force Rises in Beijing
    Street Industrial Output Value in One Year Approaches the Total Industrial Output Value of the Entire City in 1949
    (Our Dispatch) Reporter Sun Shikai reports: Beijing street residents, organized to vigorously develop industry, have become a new social production force. In the past year, the total output value and processing fees created reached over 110 million yuan, approaching the total industrial output value of the entire city of Beijing in 1949, when it was liberated. Currently, over 180,000 people in the city are participating in street production and service undertakings, the majority of whom are housewives.
    Beijing's street production and service undertakings vigorously developed on the basis of the great victory of the rectification movement of city residents in 1958. After a year of vigorous rectification and the Red Flag emulation drive last year, it has been further consolidated and developed. Especially after implementing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, an even greater leap forward situation has emerged. There are now nearly four thousand production organizations distributed in various streets throughout the city, including factories that have grown to three or five hundred people, as well as centralized and decentralized production groups of dozens of people. Many purely consumer-oriented residential areas have begun to transform into residential areas of production labor and are gradually shifting mass life from dispersion to collectivity.
    These street production organizations generally work hard, diligently, and skillfully, relying on their own efforts, starting from scratch, with simple equipment and flexible production, including both manufacturing and repair industries; both mass production and piecemeal processing, actively serving state-owned industries and serving the lives of urban residents. According to statistics from relevant departments, there are currently more than 20 types of street production in Beijing, producing 400 to 500 types of products. Industries with a relatively large number of production personnel include the shoe and hat industry, the metal industry, special handicrafts, stationery, printing and binding, and paper products. Many street production organizations undertake the production of relatively simple products handed down by large factories, enabling some state-owned factories to free up their hands to produce higher-grade products. Among the 63 production organizations established by residents in the Chunshu Hutong area of Xuanwu District, 55 production organizations process for large factories, producing more than 40 kinds of products such as glass products, insulation materials, dyeing, cloth tape measures, and paste. After the state-owned Xinghua Dye Factory handed over all the production of ai'er dyes to the Chunshu Street Chemical Factory, it switched to producing high-grade dyes. From January to November 1959 alone, it produced ten tons of high-grade dyes, and the output value increased by 10.5 times compared with the factory's output value when it produced ai'er dyes in the same period in 1958. Most of the products of these street industries are produced using scraps and waste materials from large factories. For example, the Xinjiekou Street Chemical Factory uses the alkali mud left over from the Xisi Chemical Factory's caustic soda production as raw material, producing more than 500 tons of calcium carbonate per month.
    Street work in urban Beijing takes organizing production as the central link, promoting a leap forward in all-round work. With the development of street production, a large number of repair and service businesses have been established to serve production and serve the lives of residents. At present, there are more than 330 comprehensive service stations and offices, and more than 900 individual service points and various repair points in the city's streets, including black and white iron repair shops, clock and watch radio repair shops, and barber shops. Many neighborhood service centers in Xicheng District not only share some of the business of state-owned commercial and service undertakings but also actively carry out services such as delivering newspapers and magazines, handling savings deposits, and repair services. The Baojia Street Neighborhood Service Center increased the number of service items for residents from more than ten to seventy-three in one year and also organized a team to provide door-to-door services to help residents who are busy with production with household chores. Not long ago, they added electrician, carpenter, bricklayer, and paperhanging services according to the needs of the masses. Some residents even told their children: "If adults are not at home, ask the service center to help you with anything!" While developing street production, collective welfare undertakings have also been established. There are now more than 800 street nurseries and kindergartens and more than 340 public canteens throughout the city. The rapid development of these welfare undertakings has further liberated women's labor force and greatly encouraged their enthusiasm for participating in production labor, which has promoted the development and consolidation of street production.
    By organizing street production and service undertakings, all positive factors in society have been further mobilized to serve the construction of socialism. A new style of "every family is busy with production, and no household has idlers" has emerged in many streets in Beijing. After participating in social labor, the broad masses of housewives participate in political and cultural studies in street factories. Housewives participating in production in Xicheng District launched amateur cultural studies after work. In the past year, more than 8,000 people participated in preparatory classes for senior primary school, and more than 800 people studied junior high school courses. More than 2,000 people were also selected from housewives to serve as cultural teachers in street spare-time schools. Many women also strive to take Party classes, participate in reading groups and political activities, and greatly improve their political and ideological awareness. The communist style of loving the factory as a home and daring to think, speak, and act has been established in many people, and the narrow-mindedness, conservatism, inferiority, and weaknesses of housewives who were content with personal life in the past have been initially overcome, and they are concerned about politics, love labor, and love the collective. Within the jurisdiction of the Beixinqiao Street Office, 32 residents have joined the Communist Party, 56 have joined the Communist Youth League, and more than 300 have been named advanced producers in the past year.
    When the city's street production organization and service undertakings were established, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China established a Street Work Committee and set up an office to lead the work, and corresponding organizations were also established in various districts. The street party committee also established party organizations in larger street factories, strengthened party leadership in a timely manner, and ensured the rapid development of street industry. At the same time, the people's committees of various districts and street offices strengthened the work of the streets. Under the leadership of the Party, the women's federations and the Communist Youth League organizations also actively carried out mobilization and organizational work.

    街道居民组织起来大办街道工业
    北京崛起一支新的生产力量
    街道工业一年来生产总值接近1949年全市工业总产值
    本报讯　记者孙世恺报道：北京街道居民组织起来大办工业，已成为一支新兴的社会生产力量。一年来创造的总产值和加工费达一亿一千多万元，接近解放时1949年北京全市的工业总产值。目前全市有十八万多人参加了街道生产和服务事业，多数都是家庭妇女。
    北京市的街道生产和服务事业，是在1958年全市居民整风运动取得伟大胜利的基础上，蓬勃发展起来的。经过去年一年的大力整顿和红旗竞赛运动，有了进一步的巩固和发展。特别是在贯彻执行党的八届八中全会决议以后，出现了更大跃进的局面。现在分布在全市各个街道上的生产组织近四千个，其中有发展到三、五百人的工厂，也有几十人的集中生产组和分散生产组。许多纯消费性的居民区开始向生产劳动的居民区变化。并且逐渐把群众生活由分散引向集体。
    这些街道生产组织，一般是穷干苦干巧干，自力更生，白手起家，设备简单，生产灵活，既有制造性行业，也有修理性行业；既有成批生产，也有零星加工，积极为国营工业服务，为城市居民生活服务。据有关部门统计，目前北京市街道生产共有二十多种行业，生产四、五百种产品。生产人数较多的有鞋帽业、金属业、特种手工艺和文具、印刷装订、纸制品等。许多街道生产组织担任大工厂交下来的比较简单的产品的生产，使一些国营工厂能够腾出手来生产较高级的产品。在宣武区椿树胡同一带居民兴办的六十三个生产组织中，有五十五个生产组织为大工厂加工，产品有玻璃制品、绝缘材料、染色、布卷尺、浆糊等四十多种。国营兴华染料厂将爱耳染色全部交给椿树街道化工厂生产后，改产高级染料，仅1959年1至11月份生产了高级染料十吨，产值较这个工厂1958年同期生产爱耳染色时的产值增加了十点五倍。这些街道工业的大部分产品都是利用大工厂的下料脚和废物生产的。如新街口街道化工厂就是利用西四化工厂熬火碱剩下的火碱泥作原料，每月生产五百多吨炭酸钙。
    北京城区街道工作以组织生产为中心环节，推动了全面工作的跃进。随着街道生产的发展，大量举办了修理、服务业务，为生产服务，为居民生活服务。目前全市各街道建立综合性服务站、所三百三十多个，单项服务点和各种修理点有九百多个，其中有黑白铁修理、钟表无线电修理门市部和理发馆等。西城区许多邻里服务所不仅分担了国营商业和服务事业的部分业务，还积极开展了代送书报、代办储蓄以及修理业务。鲍家街邻里服务所一年为居民的服务项目由十多项增加到七十三项，还组织了一个小组专门到户服务，帮助生产忙的居民料理家务。不久前，她们又根据群众的要求，增添了电工、木工、瓦工、裱糊等服务项目。有的居民甚至告诉孩子说：“大人不在家，有事就请服务所帮助办吧！”在发展街道生产的同时，集体福利事业也兴办起来了。全市现有八百多个街道托儿所、幼儿园，三百四十多个公共食堂，这些福利事业的迅速发展，进一步解放了妇女劳动力，大大鼓舞了她们参加生产劳动的热情，对发展和巩固街道生产起了促进作用。
    通过组织街道生产和服务事业，进一步调动了社会上一切积极因素，为建设社会主义服务。北京市许多街道上出现了“家家忙生产，户户无闲人”的新风尚。广大家庭妇女参加了社会劳动后，在街道工厂里参加政治、文化学习。西城区参加生产的家庭妇女下班后展开了业余文化学习。一年来有八千多人参加了高小预备班，还有八百多人读初中课程。并从家庭妇女中选拔出两千多人兼任街道业余学校的文化教员。许多妇女还争先上党课，参加读报组和政治活动，大大提高政治思想觉悟。在许多人中树立起爱厂如家和敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，初步克服了过去家庭妇女的狭隘、保守、自卑和安于个人生活的弱点，关心政治、热爱劳动、热爱集体。北新桥街道办事处管界内一年来已有三十二个居民参加了共产党，五十六人入了共青团，另有三百多人被评为先进生产者。
    当全市街道生产组织和服务事业兴办时，中共北京市委成立了街道工作委员会，并成立了办公室进行领导，各区也建立相应的组织。街道党委又在较大的街道工厂建立了党的组织，及时加强了党的领导，保证街道工业迅速发展。同时，各区人民委员会和街道办事处加强了街道的工作。各级妇联和共青团组织在党的领导下也积极进行发动和组织工作。
