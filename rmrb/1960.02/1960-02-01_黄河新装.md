    5: The Inlet

    In just one year, the tunnel was excavated, a miraculous victory brought about by the Great Leap Forward era.
    Now, a large amount of finishing work remains: the inside of the tunnel needs lining, and the inlet awaits the final underwater blasting.
    Outside the inlet, there's a concrete partition, and then an earthen cofferdam. It's as if there's both a bottle stopper and a lead seal; opening them won't be easy.
    The final procedure is to first blast the partition, remove the loose debris, and then blast the earthen cofferdam. The chief engineer is most concerned about the earthen cofferdam, hoping it can stand firm, because in the end, it alone will resist the pressure of the flowing water; but when blasting it, it needs to shatter as easily as glass under a hammer.
    The grouting of the earthen cofferdam and the excavation of the rock inside the partition are carried out simultaneously. These two tasks chase each other and interfere with each other.
    That day, it really was in the morning; but neither the engineers nor the workers had slept. The grouting rig stood on the earthen cofferdam, its shadow inverted in the water. The power shovel roared intermittently, as if eager to jump out of the tunnel entrance.
    The grouting engineer and the excavation technician walked into the tent together, because the chief engineer was waiting for them.
    These two were about the same age; but they were two different people.
    The grouting engineer's surname was Zhang. I had met him more than once. His face always looked like it had been washed with mortar. The first time I met Little Zhang, his pants had a large hole burned near the knee, bigger than his knee. He still walked fine, and I was surprised that such a big hole hadn't burned his flesh? The next time I saw Little Zhang, it seemed like he hadn't slept for twenty-four hours. He was lying on a canvas bed, covered with two old sheepskin coats. This was another strange thing, the two sheepskin coats didn't even cover his feet? His head and upper body were padded with a blue cotton jacket, used as both a pillow and a mattress. Everything was temporarily put together yet seemed very comfortable. His hair was naturally similar to the black wool of the sheepskin collar. His mortar-like face maintained an alert expression: as if he could jump up from the bed as soon as someone called him; but he slept so soundly, snoring loudly, truly snoring, a real builder's sleep.
    Besides builders, no one else would have such a tent. There was a worthless stove in the tent, but the fire was burning very brightly. The tent was made of cotton, and several windows were opened for ventilation. As usual, there were several canvas beds, and under the bed was a string of double-footed picks without handles, looking like an enormous centipede. In the corner of the tent, there were piles of large pulleys, searchlights, wires, bamboo baskets, iron buckets… it could be said that everything on the construction site was here.
    I was meeting the excavation technician, Little Jiang, for the first time. His face, unlike Little Zhang's face, was like a piece of rough stone that had been washed with water, cold but gleaming. Little Jiang's clothes were also neater than Little Zhang's. I could tell that Little Zhang waited for Little Jiang to come in before saying to the chief engineer:
    "You're asking why it stopped for three hours? We evacuated on time at twelve last night, and they didn't blast until three. Oh, Little Jiang is here, ask him! I went down at eleven, contacted the place to hide from the blast; but I didn't see him."
    Little Zhang spoke quickly, like a string of firecrackers. But Little Jiang acted as if he hadn't heard anything, and didn't answer with a straight face.
    The chief engineer asked Little Jiang: "You didn't stay here last night?"
    A meeting had just been held yesterday, requiring everyone to stay on site so they could meet at twelve o'clock at night.
    Little Jiang simply said that he had come at twelve o'clock. To prove this, he said he came to pull the drill. He also complained about Little Zhang:
    "I didn't see you either!"
    "Who knows about you?" Little Zhang retorted, and seeing a grouting worker walk in, he ordered, "Don't take apart the pipes, grout when the wind comes. Grout hard on that drill hole of yours!" Little Zhang added a gesture, then turned back to Little Jiang, still speaking like a string of firecrackers: "I went down to check at eleven, the explosives were loaded, but the wires weren't connected, it was agreed to blast at twelve; but they didn't notify us. We waited until three, it almost killed us!"
    Little Jiang replied seriously: "I also said that if it wasn't blasted at twelve, I wouldn't notify you anymore."
    "The meeting decided that we'd meet at twelve!"
    Because this was an endless argument, it was stopped. Little Zhang regretted the lost three hours so much that he was almost willing to give up everything. Little Jiang was the opposite, not admitting defeat and not adding much explanation. His stern face was like the rock wall of the tunnel behind him, as if saying: I am the main project, and you all exist for the sake of the main project.
    The on-site meeting convened at the inlet was filled with numbers, pump models, head, electric roller horsepower, existing water pipe specifications and lengths, and so on. They checked account books for a while and asked the warehouse over the phone for a while. It sounded like inspecting an arsenal, filled with an atmosphere of battle. A water pump was equivalent to a cannon, and the target was the water that secretly seeped in under the covering layer of the earthen cofferdam. As much as it seeped in, that much would be pumped out.
    Finally, the chief engineer said: "We have a pumping capacity of zero point seven. You have to know that a flow rate of zero point seven can also form a small river!"
    He naturally didn't hope that such a small river would really flow in, but rather said that he had the power to pump out the water of a small river.
    Little Zhang always looked energetic, and he said: "Pump as soon as the grouting is done. Grout it with red clay, let's see how much more it can leak!" He also said to Little Jiang: "Setting up the scaffolding on the partition is your job. What about the wood? I think we can salvage a few logs from the river." He said the last sentence to the chief engineer; but without waiting for a response, he quickly explained: "I don't think it matters. It's from Yanguoxia. After we're done using it, we'll release it again, and it'll flow to Yanguoxia again."
    Little Jiang rarely expressed anything, and his words were extremely simple. Finally, when he was specifically assigned to help the relevant units transport the water pump over the outlet, he finally agreed without reluctance.
    As soon as Little Jiang turned around, the chief engineer shouted to him again:
    "You go with the movers, and discuss it locally after you pass there."
    I followed Little Jiang out of the tent, down the slope, and over the partition. I saw Little Jiang as agile as a goat, slipping down the stone blocks. He walked into the inlet, along the tunnel, sometimes walking in the water, sometimes walking on wooden boards, sometimes dodging a car, and sometimes avoiding people pushing carts. He walked really skillfully and quickly. I looked back and saw that the two people who were following were gone, so I reminded Little Jiang: "Aren't you supposed to see the outlet? Wait a moment!" Little Jiang only stood for a moment, still pursing his lips. I didn't know if it was because of the meeting just now or because of the effort of walking. Because I didn't understand him, I didn't look at him again until the two people behind came.
    Little Jiang didn't pay attention to me either, because he only stood for a moment and then walked forward again. I believe he walked even faster this time, otherwise, why hadn't we caught up with him all the way to the outlet?
    Little Jiang was a person who only wanted to do things according to his own ideas, so at the outlet, he didn't provide any help, even though his help might have been very useful. He didn't value this kind of help to others, as if he would never need the help of others in his life.

    五：进水口
    仅仅一年，隧洞就凿通了，这是跃进年代带来的奇迹般的胜利。
    现在留下一大摊收尾工程：隧洞内部需要衬砌，进水口等待着最后水下爆破。
    在进水口外边，一道混凝土隔墙，又一道草土围堰。这好像是既有瓶塞，又有铅皮封口，要打开它们，可不那么容易。
    最后的程序是先爆破隔墙，挖去浮碴，再爆破草土围堰。总工程师最关心的是草土围堰，希望它能够坚强地站立着，因为最后只靠它抵抗流水的压力；但在爆破它的时候，又要它像铁锤下的玻璃那样易于粉碎才行。
    草土围堰的灌浆，和隔墙内的石方开挖，同时进行。这两项工作互相追赶，又互相干扰。
    那一天早晨，的确是在早晨；可是不管工程师和工人，都还没有睡觉。灌浆的钻机，竖在草土围堰上，它的影子倒立在水中。电铲一阵阵轰叫着，就像它急欲从洞口里跳出来似的。
    灌浆工程师和开挖技术员两个人，一起走进了帐篷，因为总工程师在等着他们。
    这两个人年纪相仿；可是这是两个不同的人。
    灌浆工程师姓张，我遇见他已不止一次了，他的脸永远像用灰浆洗过的。我头一次遇见小张时，他的裤子靠膝盖的地方还烧了个大洞，其洞比膝盖还大，走起路来依然好好的，我真奇怪烧了这样一个大洞，竟能烧不着肉？我另一次看见小张时，似乎他二十四小时没有睡觉了。他躺在一只帆布床上，身上盖了两件老羊皮袄。这又是一件怪事，两件皮袄还没盖住他的一双脚？他的头和上半个身子垫着一件蓝棉衣，既当枕头，又当褥子。一切都是临时凑成而又觉得十分舒服的样子。他的头发，自然和羊皮领子的黑羊毛差不多。他的灰浆一般的脸，可保持着一种惊觉的神情：似乎一有人叫，就可以从床上跳起来；可是他睡得又是那么沉，呼呼的，真是呼呼的，竟是一个真正的建设者的睡眠。
    除了建设者，也不会有这般帐篷。帐篷里有一只不成器的火炉，火生得倒是很旺。帐篷是棉的，为了有烟又开了好几个窗户。照例摆着几张帆布床，床下有一串没有安把子的双脚镐，看去像一个其大无比的蜈蚣。帐篷角上，堆着大滑轮，探照灯，电线，竹筐，铁桶……可以说，工地上有的，这里都有。
    我和开挖技术员小蒋，倒是第一次见面。他的脸，不同于小张的脸，像是用水洗过的一块毛石，冷冷的；但放着光彩。小蒋的衣服，也比小张的整齐些。我看得出来，小张专等小蒋走进来才对总工程师说：
    “你问怎么停了三个钟头？我们昨夜十二点准时撤出，到了三点他们才放炮。是呀，小蒋来了，你问他吧！我十一点就下去了，联系好了躲炮地点；可是没有见他。”
    小张说得飞快，像连珠炮似的。只是小蒋像没有听见一样，板着脸没有答话。
    总工程师朝小蒋问：“昨晚你没有住这里？”
    昨天刚开过会，要大家住在现场，就是为了晚上十二点好碰头。
    小蒋只是简单地说，他十二点来过了。为了证明这个，他说他是来拉车钻的。同时他也抱怨小张：
    “我也没有见到你呀！”
    “谁知道你？”小张这么顶了一句，看见一个灌浆工人走了进来，便吩咐道：“别拆管子，来了风就灌。就是你那个钻眼，要狠狠地灌！”小张加上一个手势，便又转向小蒋，依然放连珠炮似的：“我十一点下去看的，炮装好了，只是没有连线，说好了十二点放；可又不通知我们。一直等到三点，把人害死啦！”
    小蒋一板正经地回答：“我也说好了，十二点不放就不再通知你。”
    “开会决定的，十二点碰头嘛！”
    因为这是争论不完的，所以就停止了。小张为那失去的三个小时，懊悔得几乎可以付出自己的一切。小蒋正相反，不认输，也不多加辩解。他的威严的脸，像是他身后那个隧洞的岩壁，好像说：我是主体工程，你们都是为了主体工程而存在的。
    进水口召集的现场会议，充满了数字，泵的型号，扬程多少，电滚的马力，现有水管的规格和长度等等。一会儿查帐簿，一会儿用电话问仓库。听去像是检点军械仓库似的，充满了作战的气氛。一个水泵，等于一个大炮，目标是由草土围堰下面复盖层偷偷渗进来的水。它渗进来多少，就抽掉多少。
    最后，总工程师说：“我们有了零点七的抽水能力。要知道零点七的流量，也就能淌成小河啦！”
    他自然不希望真的有这么一条小河淌进来，而是说他具有力量能把一条小河的水抽出去。
    小张总是精神焕发的样子，他说：“灌好浆就抽。用红胶泥灌它，看它还能漏进多少？”他又对小蒋说：“隔墙搭架子，是你的事。木料呢？我看河里流下来的，可以捞上几根。”最后一句话他是向总工程师说的；但不等回答，他又忙着解释说：“我想没有关系。那是盐锅峡的，等咱用完了，再放下去，又流到盐锅峡了。”
    小蒋很少表示什么，说话也极简单。最后分配他具体帮助有关单位把水泵运过出水口时，他总算毫不勉强地答应下来了。
    小蒋刚一转身，总工程师就又对他喊道：
    “你和搬运的人一起走，走过那里就当地商量一下。”
    我跟在小蒋后面走出帐篷，下了坡，又越过隔墙。我看见小蒋像山羊一样灵活，踏着石块溜了下去。他走进进水口，顺着隧洞，一会走在水里，一会走在木板上，一会闪过一辆汽车，一会又躲过推车的人，他走得真是又熟练又快。我回头一看，跟来的两个人不见了，就向小蒋提醒道：“不是要看出水口吗？等等吧！”小蒋这才站了一会，仍然鼓着嘴。我不知他为了刚才的会，还是为了走路用劲的关系。因为我不了解他，在后面两个人走来以前，我再没有看他。
    小蒋也不曾理会我，因为他只站了一下，又向前走去了。我相信他这回比上回走得更快，不然，为什么我们一直到出水口，还没有追上他呢？
    小蒋是一个只愿根据自己的意思办事的人，所以在出水口那里，丝毫没有得到他的帮助，也许他的帮助是十分有用的。他没有看重对别人的这种帮助，好像他一辈子也不需要别人的帮助似的。
