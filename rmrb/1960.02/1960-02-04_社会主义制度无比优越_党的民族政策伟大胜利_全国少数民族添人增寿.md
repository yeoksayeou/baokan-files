Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The population of all ethnic minorities in the country is growing rapidly. Many weak and small ethnic groups that were on the verge of extinction in old China are now prosperous and thriving. On the grasslands where there were few infants before liberation, people's communes have now set up nurseries, kindergartens, and primary schools, nurturing large groups of ethnic minority children. The vast areas inhabited by ethnic minorities are filled with joyful scenes of "thriving livestock, abundant fields, and increased production."

The shift from population decline to growth among ethnic minorities vividly demonstrates the superiority of the socialist system. Before liberation, the ethnic minority people were subjected to cruel oppression by imperialism, domestic reactionaries, and internal reactionary forces. They suffered from hunger, cold, disease, natural disasters, bandits, and clan fights, resulting in continuous population decline and severe threats to the continuation of their ethnic groups. In the vast agricultural and pastoral areas, there were no specialized medical institutions in the past, and ethnic minority people had to resort to praying to ghosts and gods when they got sick. The border areas of Yunnan, known as "malaria-infested zones," once experienced the tragic situation of "nine out of ten houses being empty." In some places, the reactionary rulers even provoked mutual killings between or within ethnic groups, resulting in the deaths of large numbers of people. After liberation, ethnic minorities were freed from their fate of gradual decline. The Party and the state led the people of all ethnic groups in carrying out social reforms, abolishing the system of exploitation, and vigorously developing the economy and culture, creating the most fundamental conditions for the development of the ethnic minority populations. Many ethnic minorities quickly reversed the trend of population decline. During the First Five-Year Plan period alone, the total population of ethnic minorities in the country increased from more than 35 million to more than 38 million. The Mongolian ethnic group in Inner Mongolia, which was predicted by Japanese imperialists to be extinct within fifty years, increased by more than 380,000 people from the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in 1947 to 1958, equivalent to 36% of the original Mongolian population. In the sparsely populated Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the various ethnic minorities increased by more than 580,000 people in seven years. In 1958, the ethnic minority population of Guizhou Province increased by more than 600,000 compared to 1949, reaching more than 4 million. The Haixi Mongolian-Tibetan-Kazak Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province is sparsely populated, with an average of only one person living per 13 square kilometers. Many herders who had no children now have children after eliminating disasters and diseases. The Hezhe ethnic group in Heilongjiang was massacred, expelled, and deprived by the reactionary rule in the decades before liberation, reducing sharply from more than 2,000 people to 300 people. Thanks to the Party and the state's care, this nation on the verge of extinction had risen to more than 600 people by 1958. After the establishment of the people's communes, people of all ethnic groups happily gathered in the big family of the commune, with food, clothing, labor, and leisure, and universally increased in population and longevity.

Population growth is the result of the great political, economic, and cultural development of ethnic minorities. After the realization of ethnic regional autonomy and socialist transformation, the poverty and backwardness left over from history are being gradually eliminated, and the people's living standards are constantly rising. According to statistics from the four autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Guangxi, and Ningxia in 1958, the average per capita purchasing power of consumer goods increased nearly four times compared to 1949. In Wujiao Village, Jianhe County, Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, there are 104 households with 523 people. In the early days of liberation, the entire village had only seven cotton-padded jackets and no cotton quilts. People covered themselves with bark, rice seedlings, or warmed themselves by the fire in winter. Now, every family has cotton quilts, and everyone has cotton-padded clothes. In the northeastern region, the Hezhe and Oroqen people, who originally lived in forests, caves, and "immortal pillars" (sheds made of birch bark or animal skins), have moved into spacious and bright new houses, and their fish-skin and animal-skin clothes have been replaced by cloth and wool clothes. On the vast grasslands, more than 2 million herders have ended their centuries of nomadic life and have settled down for grazing. As people's living conditions improve, mortality has decreased, and the survival rate of infants has greatly increased.

In order to help the ethnic minorities develop faster, the Party and the state pay special attention to health and medical work in the ethnic minority areas, establishing medical institutions widely and sending out mobile medical and epidemic prevention teams, so that the vast ethnic minority people can receive free or subsidized medical care from the state. By the end of 1958, more than 15,900 medical institutions such as hospitals, health centers, and prevention stations had been established in ethnic minority areas, as well as a large number of rural hospitals and maternity hospitals. At present, several infectious diseases that have been most prevalent and harmful to the ethnic minority people for a long time have been basically controlled or eradicated, and maternal and child health care has been widely carried out. In the patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests, people of all ethnic groups have established a social atmosphere of cleanliness and hygiene, and their physical fitness has been enhanced. After realizing their wishes for prosperous population and ethnic prosperity, they enthusiastically sang: Flowers dance and mountains laugh, the national policy shines brightly, crops are abundant and people are healthy, and happiness depends entirely on the leadership of the Party.

    社会主义制度无比优越　党的民族政策伟大胜利
    全国少数民族添人增寿
    新华社3日讯　全国各少数民族的人口迅速增长，许多在旧中国奄奄一息的弱小民族，现在人寿年丰，欣欣向荣。在那些解放前婴儿很少的草原上，而今，人民公社也办起了托儿所、幼儿园和小学校，抚育着大群的少数民族儿童。辽阔的少数民族地区，到处呈现“人畜两旺田增产”的欢乐景象。
    少数民族人口从下降到上升，生动地显示了社会主义制度的优越性。解放以前，各少数民族人民在帝国主义、国内反动派和民族内部反动势力的残酷压榨下，饥寒交迫，加上疾病、天灾、匪患、械斗带来的苦难，人口不断减少，民族的延续受到了严重威胁。广大农牧地区，过去没有专门的医疗机构，少数民族人民生了病只得求鬼拜神。被称做“瘴癘之区”的云南边疆地区，就曾经出现过“十室九空”的惨象。在有些地方，反动统治者还挑拨各民族之间或民族内部相互仇杀，也造成大批生命的死亡。解放以后，少数民族摆脱了日渐衰亡的命运，党和国家领导各民族人民进行社会改革，废除剥削制度，大力发展经济和文化，为少数民族发展人口创造了最根本的条件。许多少数民族迅速扭转了人口下降的趋势，仅仅在国家第一个五年计划期间，全国少数民族的人口，就由三千五百多万上升到三千八百多万。被日本帝国主义者预言五十年内即将灭种的内蒙古蒙古族，从内蒙古自治区成立的1947年到1958年，增长了三十八万多人，相当于原有蒙古族人口的36％。在地广人稀的新疆维吾尔自治区，各少数民族在七年当中，增加了五十八万多人。贵州省1958年的少数民族人口，比1949年净增六十多万，达到四百多万人。青海省的海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州人烟稀少，平均每十三平方公里才居住一个人，许多无儿无女的牧民，现在已经消灾灭病，抱上了娃娃。黑龙江的赫哲族，在解放前的几十年内被反动统治屠杀、驱逐和剥夺，从两千多人锐减到三百人。经过党和国家亲切的照顾，这个濒于灭亡的民族到1958年已上升到六百多人口。人民公社化以后，各民族人民欢聚在公社大家庭中，有吃有穿，有劳有逸，更是普遍地添人增寿。
    人口增长是少数民族政治、经济、文化大发展的结果。各民族在实现民族区域自治和社会主义改造之后，历史上遗留下来的贫困落后，正在逐步消除，人民生活水平不断上升。据内蒙古、新疆、广西、宁夏四个自治区1958年的统计，平均每人消费品购买力比1949年提高了将近四倍。黔东南苗族侗族自治州剑河县巫脚寨有一百零四户，五百二十三人，解放初期全村只有七件棉衣，没有一床棉被，都是盖木皮、秧被或烤火过冬，现在家家有棉被，人人有棉衣。在东北地区，原来住在树林、山洞和仙人柱（用桦树皮或兽皮搭的棚屋）的赫哲族和鄂伦春人，已经迁进宽敞明亮的新屋，他们身上的鱼皮衣、兽皮衣，也为布衣、绒衣所代替。在各个大草原上，二百多万牧民结束了千百年飘游无定的生活，实行定居放牧。人们生活条件改善以后，死亡减少了，婴儿成活率大大提高。
    党和国家为了帮助各少数民族更快地发展，特别重视民族地区的卫生医疗工作，一面广泛建立医疗机构，一面派出巡回医疗防疫队，使广大少数民族人民受到国家的免费医疗或补助。到1958年底，少数民族地区建立一万五千九百多个医院、保健所、防治站等医疗机构，以及大量的乡村医院、产院。现在，长期在少数民族人民中蔓延最广、危害最大的几种传染病，已经被基本上控制或根除，妇幼保健工作普遍开展。各族人民在除四害爱国卫生运动中，树立了爱清洁讲卫生的社会风气，体质有了增强。他们实现人口兴旺、民族繁荣的心愿以后，热情地歌颂着：花也舞来山也笑，民族政策光辉照，五谷丰登人健壮，幸福全靠党领导。
