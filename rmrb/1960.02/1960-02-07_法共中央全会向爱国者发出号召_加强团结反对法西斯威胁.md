Xinhua News Agency, Paris, February 4th: The French Communist Party held a Central Committee plenary session on February 2nd and 3rd. The meeting heard a report by Waldeck Rochet, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, on the riots of extreme colonialists in Algiers, and adopted a corresponding resolution.

The resolution expressed satisfaction with the fact that the French rioters in Algiers and their accomplices in the military and civilian sectors had been met with a large-scale and rapid counterattack by the working class and the entire people.

The resolution pointed out that the French people now demand that the government dissolve all fascist organizations, ban their publications, severely punish their accomplices in the army and police, disband armed groups, and swiftly punish the ringleaders of the riots and their agents in France.

The resolution emphasized that it is urgently needed to stop the war quickly on the basis of the self-determination of the Algerian people, and the primary condition for realizing self-determination is to stop military operations.

The resolution condemned the government for, on the one hand, condoning conspirators in civil administrations and the army, thereby encouraging the outbreak of the fascist armed riots in Algiers, and on the other hand, prohibiting Republican (including trade union) gatherings to oppose the riots, and confiscating "l'Humanité" and many other democratic newspapers.

The resolution pointed out that recent events are sufficient to show that the government and its agents do not lack the means, but rather lack the desire to use these means to resolve the Algerian issue. Therefore, Communist Party members of parliament oppose granting the government special powers.

The Communist Party leadership called on working people, all anti-fascist fighters, and patriots to further strengthen their unity, "because their actions are decisive for defeating the conspirators."

The Central Committee plenary session approved the Political Bureau's appeal to all Republican parties and democratic groups, calling on everyone to unite to deal with the fascist threat.

    法共中央全会向爱国者发出号召
    加强团结反对法西斯威胁
    据新华社巴黎4日电　法国共产党2日和3日举行了中央委员会全体会议，会议听取了中央委员会政治局委员瓦德克·罗歇就阿尔及尔极端殖民主义分子暴乱事件所作的报告，并通过了相应的决议。
    决议对这一情况表示满意：阿尔及尔的法国暴乱分子以及他们在军民中的帮凶遭到了工人阶级和全体人民大规模的迅速反击。
    决议指出，法国人民现在要求政府解散所有的法西斯团体，禁止它们发行书刊，严惩它们在军队和警察中的帮凶，取消武装集团，迅速严惩暴乱头子和他们在法国的代理人。
    决议着重指出，急需在阿尔及利亚人民自决的基础上从速停止战争，而实现自决的首要条件是停止军事行动。
    决议谴责政府一方面纵容在民政机构和军队中的阴谋分子，从而鼓励了阿尔及尔法西斯武装暴乱的发生，而另一方面却禁止共和人士（包括工会）集会来反对暴乱，并且没收“人道报”和其他许多民主报纸。
    决议指出，最近的事件足以表明，政府和它的代理人不是缺少手段，而是没有运用这些手段来解决阿尔及利亚问题的愿望。因此，共产党议员反对授给政府特别权力。
    共产党领导机构号召劳动人民、所有的反法西斯战士和爱国者更加加强团结，“因为他们的行动对击败阴谋者有决定性的意义。”
    中央全会赞同了政治局给各共和党派和民主团体的呼吁书，号召大家联合起来对付法西斯威胁。
