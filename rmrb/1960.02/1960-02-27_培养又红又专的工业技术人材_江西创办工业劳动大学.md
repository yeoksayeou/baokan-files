    培养又红又专的工业技术人材
    江西创办工业劳动大学
    新华社南昌26日电　江西省创办的工业劳动大学，于23日开始招生。这所工业劳动大学是江西省继在山区创办共产主义劳动大学之后，为了培养又红又专的工业建设人材而创办的。
    工业劳动大学根据党的教育为无产阶级的政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，实行勤工俭学、半工半读、学习与生产劳动相结合、政治与业务相结合。学生在学习期间，既劳动，又学习，经过两年或四年时间，分别达到初级和中级工业技术人材的水平。
    学校总校设在南昌市，各专区、市和大厂矿企业里都设有分校。根据江西工业、交通运输业发展的需要，学校分别设置了冶金、煤炭、机械、电力、轻工业、纺织、地质、建筑、铁路、公路、航运、邮电、石油、化工等系科，吸收具有一定政治条件和生产经验的男、女工人、店员、公社社员、转业军人和社会青年参加学习。
    为了加强对工业劳动大学的领导，中共江西省委书记白栋材兼任校长，副校长分别由省委的工业、交通部的部长等兼任，还有专职的党委书记和副校长。各分校的校长和党委书记也都分别由各地委、市委书记和厂矿的党委书记兼任。
