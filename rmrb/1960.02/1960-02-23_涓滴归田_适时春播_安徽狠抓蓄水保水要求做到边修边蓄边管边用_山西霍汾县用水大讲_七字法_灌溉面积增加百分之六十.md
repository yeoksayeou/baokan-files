Returning Every Drop to the Fields, Timely Spring Planting
Anhui Vigorously Grasping Water Storage and Conservation, Requiring Simultaneous Construction, Storage, Management, and Utilization
Shanxi's Huofen County Emphasizes the "Seven-Character Method" for Water Use, Increasing Irrigation Area by Sixty Percent

Our Newspaper Hefei, February 22nd Dispatch: Anhui is placing great emphasis on simultaneous construction and water storage during large-scale water conservancy projects, in order to ensure timely irrigation and guarantee spring planting. Currently, in the deployment of leadership focus and resources for water conservancy construction throughout the province, the emphasis is on key projects, particularly large and medium-sized reservoirs and river network water storage projects, accelerating the progress of these projects to strive for early completion and early water storage.

Anhui Province's spring planting area this year is larger than last year, requiring a large amount of water. The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to water storage and conservation. Since construction began last winter, the Provincial Committee has instructed all localities to vigorously carry out water storage projects, constructing and storing water simultaneously, completing construction early to store water early, and not letting a single drop of water go to waste. Based on this instruction, various localities have adopted the following measures to vigorously grasp water storage and conservation work. First, for larger reservoir projects, construction begins with damming and diverting the flow, or damming is done in advance, to achieve simultaneous construction and water storage. Wuhu Special District has adopted the above method, enabling the completed 288,000+ reservoirs and ponds to store a total of 1.35 billion cubic meters of water, which can guarantee the irrigation needs of more than 4.5 million mu of double-cropping early rice. Second, in the plains area, river networking and riverbed spring development are vigorously carried out, intercepting and storing all three sources of water: sky water, groundwater, and surface water. Currently, more than 16,600 riverbed springs have been developed in the Huaibei area, and the groundwater extracted from the springs in Fuyang Special District alone reaches more than 600 million cubic meters. Third, in mountainous and hilly areas, in addition to vigorously developing reservoir groups, small ponds and spring field ridges are also being heightened and deepened to store all winter and spring rainwater, without letting a single drop of water run off. Fourth, management and maintenance of completed projects are strengthened, and channels are opened to divert water into reservoirs. Under the slogan of "Store one more cubic meter of water, increase grain yield by one dou," many areas have mobilized the masses to organize specialized water storage and conservation teams, actively carrying out water storage work. During the rain and snow in mid-January, Shouxian County organized a total of 65,000+ people to engage in water storage and conservation, diverting water to 89,000+ ditches, ponds, reservoirs, and dams in seven days.

While vigorously grasping main projects, various localities are also actively doing a good job in ancillary projects such as culverts and irrigation canals, striving to complete the entire project so that they can benefit in the same year. In the past two months, Fengtai County has completed 10,422 culverts and sluice gates. Due to the vigorous efforts in supporting projects in the irrigation area of the Shili Hang project in Lu'an Special District, more than half of the newly built channels can be put into operation immediately after completion.

In order to further ensure good construction, management, and utilization, water conservancy management organizations have been established throughout the province to strengthen the protection and maintenance of completed water conservancy projects and to ensure that water storage and conservation work is regularized.

Our Newspaper Taiyuan, February 22nd Dispatch: Shanxi Province's Huofen County has achieved great results in drought resistance and spring irrigation by focusing on the "Seven-Character Method" for water use, benefiting a large area and obtaining a high yield.

Huofen County has a total of 1.3 flows of surface water. Up to now, one flow has increased the average irrigated area per day and night from 950 mu last year to 2,200 mu. According to this calculation, the county's irrigated area can jump from 63,000 mu last year to more than 100,000 mu, and the average irrigated area per flow has also increased from 48,000 mu last year to 76,000 mu, an increase of about 60% compared to last year.

Huofen County's "Seven-Character Method" for water use is: Store, Straighten, Level, Specialize, Change, Match, Compete.

Store, means to store floodwater, store winter free-flowing water, store spring water, store ice water, store snow water. The amount of these five types of water is very large, with the county storing at least 13.25 million cubic meters annually. Since last winter, the county has built four large reservoirs, 320 storage ponds, and 560 dry wells, with a total storage capacity of 2.02 million cubic meters. The two large reservoirs and 250 storage ponds currently under construction, when completed, can store more than 5 million cubic meters of water.

Straighten, is straightening and repairing channels. The channels in Huofen County have many bends, leak a lot of water, and have a high evaporation rate. In order to change this situation, the people of the county have carried out repairs on channels of all sizes since last winter. Up to now, 740 gate openings and 34 aqueducts have been built, and 321 bends have been straightened, so that the channel water flows smoothly, reducing evaporation and leakage. In particular, the straightening of the 20+ li of Shahe channel's bottom has increased the water utilization rate by an average of more than 5%.

Level, is leveling the land. This work is closely combined with the county's large-scale garden-style farmland and high-yield plot campaign. Old irrigated land involves leveling the high parts of the ridgelines and field edges. New irrigated land is comprehensively renovated to achieve flat and level ground. Currently, 80,000 mu of land in the county has reached this standard, and efforts are being made to reach about 150,000 mu by the end of March.

Specialize, is organizing specialized irrigation teams. The county has organized 400 people into specialized irrigation teams, with 3-5 people assigned to 500 mu of land to be responsible for irrigation and implementing "six fixes," namely: fix personnel, fix leadership, fix irrigation, fix tasks, fix completion time, and fix irrigation quality. In this way, the phenomenon of water waste is eliminated.

Change, is changing unreasonable water use habits. This means: changing from large-scale flooding irrigation of large plots to small-scale irrigation of small plots; changing from mixed planting of different crops to contiguous planting of the same type of crops; changing from separate irrigation of well water and channel water to mixed irrigation of well water and channel water, which greatly improves the water utilization rate.

Match, is complete sets of channels, reservoirs, and ponds. All the projects built in the county since last winter have been carried out in accordance with the principles of developing both channels and reservoirs, combining diversion and storage, and managing both floodwaters and clear waters. According to preliminary calculations based on the various projects completed in the county, complete sets of reservoirs, channels, and ponds can save 300,000 workdays, save 300,000 yuan, irrigate 12,000 mu more land, and shorten the construction period by 70 days compared to the past practice of independent and unconnected projects.

Compete, is launching competitions. In order to improve water utilization and ensure that rational water use and water conservation are carried out simultaneously, inter-channel chain competitions and opponent competitions have been launched, and eleven model units and forty-two model individuals have been rewarded.

Due to the adoption of the "Seven-Character Method," the water utilization rate has been greatly improved, and the spring irrigation progress has been accelerated. It is expected that this year's spring irrigation in the county will be completed half a month to twenty days earlier than in previous years.

    涓滴归田　适时春播
    安徽狠抓蓄水保水要求做到边修边蓄边管边用
    山西霍汾县用水大讲“七字法”灌溉面积增加百分之六十
    本报合肥22日电　安徽各地在大兴水利中，十分重视边施工边蓄水，以便及时浇灌，保证春播。目前，全省在兴修水利的领导重心和力量布局上，着重大抓骨干工程，特别是大、中型水库和河网蓄水工程，加快这些工程的进度，以争取尽快完成，早日蓄水。
    安徽省今年春播作物面积比去年扩大，需水量很大。中共安徽省委对蓄水保水工作极为重视。自去冬开工兴修以来，省委即指示各地大搞蓄水工程，边兴修边蓄水，早完工早蓄水，不让一滴水白流。各地根据这一指示，采取如下几项措施，狠抓蓄水保水工作。第一，对较大的水库工程，施工开始就堵口截流，或者是提前堵口，做到边施工边蓄水。芜湖专区采取上述办法，使已完工的二十八万八千多处水库、塘坝工程，总蓄水量达十三亿五千万立方米，可以保证四百五十多万亩双季早稻的灌溉需要。第二，在平原地区大搞河网化和河内下泉，把天上、地下、地面三水统统拦蓄起来。目前淮北地区已在河内下泉一万六千六百多眼，仅阜阳专区因下泉引出的地下水即达六亿多万方。第三，在山区和丘陵地区除大搞水库群工程外，还大力加高、挖深小型塘坝和春田埂，把冬、春雨水全部蓄起来，不放走一滴水。第四，对已竣工的工程加强管理养护，开沟引水入库。不少地区在“多蓄一方水，增收一斗粮”的口号下，发动群众组织蓄水保水专业队，积极开展蓄水工作。寿县在元月中旬和的雨雪期间，共组织六万五千多人上阵蓄水保水，七天便引灌沟塘库坝八万九千多处。
    各地在大抓主体工程的同时，并积极做好涵闸、灌溉渠等辅助工程，力争做到工程成套，保证当年受益。凤台县两个月来已做好涵闸、斗门一万零四百二十二座。六安专区史淠杭工程灌溉区由于狠抓了配套工程，新建成的渠道，有一半以上完成后即可以通水。
    为进一步做到修好、管好、用好，全省各地均成立了水利管理组织，加强对已竣工的水利工程的护养，保证蓄水、保水工作经常化。
    本报太原22日电　山西省霍汾县大抓用水“七字法”，在抗旱春浇中获得大面积高额受益的成绩。
    霍汾县境内共有一点三个流量的地上水，到现在为止，一个流量一昼夜平均浇地已由去年的九百五十亩增加到二千二百亩。按此计算，全县浇地面积可由去年的六万三千亩，一跃而为十万余亩，每个流量平均浇地也由去年的四万八千亩，提高到七万六千亩，比去年提高约60％。
    霍汾县的用水“七字法”是：蓄、整、平、专、改、套、赛。
    蓄，就是蓄洪水、蓄冬季自流水、蓄泉水、蓄冰水、蓄雪水。这五种水的数量很大，全县每年至少有一千三百二十五万立方以上。从去冬到现在，全县建成大蓄水库四个、蓄水池三百二十个、旱井五百六十眼，共可蓄水二百零二万立方。目前正在施工的两个大蓄水库和二百五十个蓄水池，完工后可蓄水五百万立方以上。
    整，是整修渠道。霍汾县的渠道拐弯多、漏水多、蒸发量大。为了改变这种状况，从去冬开始，全县人民对大小渠道都进行了整修，到现在已经修建闸口七百四十个，渡槽三十四处，裁弯三百二十一个，使渠水畅流，减少了蒸发和漏水。特别是对全县二十余里的沙河渠底的整理、水的利用率平均提高了5％以上。
    平，是平整土地。这项工作是紧密结合全县大闹园田化、丰产方运动进行的。旧水地是把垅边和地头两边高出的部分进行平整；新水地是全面整修，做到地平水平。现在全县达到这种标准的土地已有八万亩，力争3月底达到十五万亩左右。
    专，是组织浇地专业队伍。全县组织四百人的浇地专业队伍，五百亩地确定三至五人，负责浇灌、并实行“六定”，即：定人员、定领导、定浇地、定任务、定完成时间，定浇地质量。这样，就杜绝了浪费水的现象。
    改，是改变用水不合理的习惯。这就是：改大水大畦漫灌为小水小畦灌溉；改不同作物交叉种植为同类作物连片种植；改井水、渠水单独灌溉为井水、渠水混合灌溉，这样，大大地提高了水的利用率。
    套，是渠、库、池成套。全县去冬以来所建的工程，都是按照渠库并举、引蓄结合、清洪都搞的原则进行的。根据目前全县已完成的各项工程初步计算，库、渠、池成套以后，比过去的互不挂钩，各自进行可省工三十万个，省钱三十万元，多浇地一万二千亩，工期缩短七十天。
    赛，就是展开竞赛。为了提高水的利用率，做到合理用水和节约用水同时并举，各个渠道之间展开了连环赛、对手赛，共奖励了模范单位十一个、模范个人四十二个。
    由于采取了“七字法”，就大大提高了水的利用率，加速了春浇进度，预计全县今年的春浇将比往年提前半月到二十天完成。
