    “Is Reading Always Beneficial?”
    Poem by Chi Bei’ou, Drawing by Fang Cheng
    In books, there are beauties like jade,
    In books, there are also ghosts that cry at night.
    Yellow novels are being heavily dumped,
    But literary arts are not to be read.
    “Tom Sawyer” and “Leaves of Grass” are forbidden,
    “Quick ways to get rich” and “How to find a mate” are promoted.
    What kind of society has what kind of culture,
    What kind of country sells what kind of books.
    Let people all delve into “The Sexual Behavior of the Human Female,”
    And memorize “How to Play Golf All the Time,”
    Believe that “The End of the World” is sure to come,
    And find relief from spiritual pain from "The Robe."
    If ordinary people all become “The Quiet American,”
    It will be easier to preserve the “Affluent Society” of the big bosses.
   ?: Refers to how the American rulers believe it is beneficial for them to have the people read books that are lewd and lead to robbery.
   ?: "Tom Sawyer" and "Leaves of Grass" are works by the famous American writers Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman, which were once listed as banned books by the American authorities.
   ?: "The Sexual Behavior of the Human Female," "How to Play Golf All the Time," "The End of the World," "The Robe," and "The Quiet American" are all bestsellers in the United States in the mid-1950s. (Attached image)

    “开卷有益?”
    池北偶诗　方成画
    书中自有颜如玉，
    书中自有鬼夜哭。
    黄色小说大倾销，
    文学艺术不要读。
    禁止“汤姆·莎耶”、“草叶集”，?
    提倡“发财捷径”、“求偶术”。
    什么样的社会有什么样的文化，
    什么样的国家卖什么样的书。
    让人们都去钻研“女性的性行为”，?
    背诵“怎样经常打好高尔夫”，
    相信“世界末日”必将来临，
    从“基督的外衣”解脱心灵的痛苦。
    老百姓都变成“沉静的美国人”，
    大老板“富裕的社会”就容易保住。
   ?：指美国统治者认为让人民去读诲淫诲盗的书对他们有好处。
   ?：“汤姆·莎耶”和“草叶集”是美国著名文豪马克吐温和诗人惠特曼的著作，曾被美国当局列入禁书。
   ?：“女性的性行为”、“怎样经常打好高尔夫”、“世界末日”、“基督的外衣”、“沉静的美国人”都是美国五十年代中的畅销书书名。（附图片）
