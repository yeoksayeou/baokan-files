Xinhua News Agency, 4th. According to the Beijing Worker's Daily, Xu Xuehui, filled with the deep friendship of the Soviet people, returned to the border city of Manzhouli in her motherland at 11:30 AM on the 3rd.

She returned by train from Chita on the evening of the 2nd. The director of the Chita Orthopedic Equipment Factory in the Soviet Union, Lomanov, who invited Xu Xuehui to Chita, as well as the director of the Chita Oblast Social Welfare Bureau, Staryolova, and the representative of the Chita Oblast Communist Youth League Committee, Lyuda Petrovskaya, reluctantly accompanied Xu Xuehui to the Soviet Trans-Baikal Station on the Sino-Soviet border.

At 1:30 PM on the 3rd, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Palace in Manzhouli was packed with people. Youths from all walks of life in the city held a grand gathering to warmly welcome Xu Xuehui back from the great ally with the "Hand of Sino-Soviet Friendship." At the meeting, Xu Xuehui conveyed the Soviet people's infinite care and selfless friendship to the Chinese people. He said, "Thanks to the help of Comrade Lomanov, the director of the Chita Orthopedic Equipment Factory, and the enthusiastic care of the people of Chita, I am now able to independently eat, write, comb my hair, brush my teeth, use needles and thread, scissors, type, pyrograph, and engage in simple woodworking." Xu Xuehui said excitedly, "Wherever I went in the Soviet Union, I was received like a relative. Their deep friendship towards the Chinese people is hard to express in words. I will definitely use the hand of Sino-Soviet friendship to study hard, master more skills, and contribute more to Sino-Soviet friendship and the socialist construction of the motherland."

After returning to Manzhouli, Xu Xuehui wrote a letter to Lomanov, the director of the Chita Orthopedic Equipment Factory, to express her heartfelt gratitude for the meticulous care she received during her stay in the Soviet Union.

The day before Xu Xuehui left Chita, Arnov, the First Secretary of the Chita Municipal Party Committee, and Zorin, the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Chita City Soviet of Working People's Deputies, received Xu Xuehui and presented her with souvenirs. On the same day, all the staff of the Party, government, and Youth League organizations in Chita also met with Xu Xuehui.

At 7:30 PM on the 3rd, Xu Xuehui took a train in Manzhouli to return to Beijing.

    新华社4日讯　据北京工人日报报道，徐学惠已经带着苏联人民的深厚友谊，在3日上午十一点半回到了祖国的边境城市满洲里。
    她是2日晚上八时乘火车自赤塔回国的。邀请徐学惠去赤塔的苏联赤塔整形器材厂厂长洛玛诺夫，和赤塔州社会福利局局长斯达略洛娃、赤塔州共青团委代表柳达·彼得洛夫斯卡娅，恋恋不舍地一直将徐学惠送到中苏边境的苏联后贝加尔车站。

    徐学惠回到满洲里后，写了一封信给赤塔整形器材厂厂长洛玛诺夫，对她在苏联期间受到的无微不至的照顾表示衷心的感谢。
