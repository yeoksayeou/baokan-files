    Ancient Zoological and Botanical Gardens
    Chen Jiang
    The emergence of zoological and botanical gardens in our country has a long history. However, those were places for emperors and their concubines to enjoy themselves, unlike today's Beijing Zoo, which is one of the recreational places for the broad masses of working people during holidays.
    Ancient books record that King Wen of Zhou had a "Lingyou," which was seventy li in circumference and contained animals such as deer, rabbits, and birds. It should be said that it was China's ancient zoo.
    The types of animals in ancient zoos were very few. This was determined by the underdeveloped productive forces at that time and the limited scope of people's activities.
    Emperor Wu of Han, Liu Che, built the Shanglin Garden on the basis of the old garden of the Qin Dynasty in Chang'an (Xi'an). The Shanglin Garden was next to the Wei River, close to Mount Zhongnan, and was three hundred li in circumference. Its range roughly included today's Chang'an, Hu County, and Zhouzhi County. Sima Xiangru once wrote a "Shanglin Fu" to praise it.
    The Shanglin Garden was a very large zoological and botanical garden in ancient China. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, the country was strong and its territory was vast. Therefore, the animals and plants in the Shanglin Garden were greatly increased compared with the gardens of the Zhou and Qin dynasties. In addition to ordinary loquat, waxberry, persimmon, and jujube, there were also exotic plants and trees obtained from Nanyue, such as musk, henna, longan, lychee, betel nut, olive, and thousand-year orange, as well as grapes and alfalfa brought back by Zhang Qian from the Western Regions. In addition to ordinary deer and roe deer, there were also animals collected from the Western Regions and other places, such as giant elephants, lions, bears, Ferghana horses, yaks, white parrots, and purple mandarin ducks.
    There were many palaces and temples in the garden, such as the Guānxiàng Palace, Bailu Palace, Zhiquè Palace, and Datái Palace. These were all places where animals were kept, equivalent to today's panda pavilion in the Beijing Zoo. Generally, rare and precious animals were given houses and specially raised. As for rabbits and the like, because the Shanglin Garden was large, they were allowed to enter and exit the bushes as targets for Emperor Wu to hunt.
    There was a Kunming Pool in the garden, covering an area of 320 hectares, in which many fish were raised. In addition, there were some small ponds such as Dongbei Pool, Xibei Pool, Jicaochi Pool and Kuaichi Pool, which were used to plant and place some flowers and trees. For example, Kuaichi Pool was planted with kuai grass (which can be used for weaving mats), and a coral tree was placed in Jicaochi Pool, which was named Beacon Tree because of its bright color.
    The lychee, praised by poets as "moister than lotus in water, fresher than oranges after frost," was carefully cultivated in the Shanglin Garden. Emperor Wu of Han specially built a Fuligong Palace to plant lychee trees, with dozens of people to manage them, paying attention to keeping them warm so they would not freeze to death. Some southern plants such as longan and citrus were also planted in the Fuligong Palace, but eventually, due to the cold climate in Chang'an, the survival rate was not high, and those that survived did not bear fruit.
    Although there were many animals and plants in the Shanglin Garden, it was not comparable to our zoological and botanical gardens today. The giraffe (regarded by the ancients as an auspicious beast) was absent. Emperor Wu of Han wanted to see whales, so he had to carve a large stone into the shape of a whale and place it in Kunming Pool.

    古代的动植物园
    陈江
    动物园和植物园在我国的出现，已有很久的历史了。不过，那是皇帝及其嫔妃们游乐的地方，不像今天的北京动物园那样，是广大劳动人民假日的游憩地之一。
    古书上记载着周文王有“灵囿”，方圆七十里，其中有鹿，有兔，有鸟等等动物。应该说，它就是我国古代的动物园了。
    古代动物园中的动物，种类很少，这是由于当时的生产力还不发达，人们的活动范围不广所决定的。
    汉武帝刘彻，在长安（西安）秦朝旧苑基础上修筑了上林苑。上林苑旁临渭水，靠近终南山，周围三百里，其范围大致包括有今日长安、鄠县和盩厔三县。司马相如曾经写了一篇“上林赋”来称颂它。
    上林苑是我国古代规模很大的一个动物园和植物园。汉武帝时国势强盛，疆域辽阔，因而上林苑中的动物和植物，同周秦的苑囿比起来，是大大地增多了。植物如一般的枇杷、杨梅、柿、枣等外，还有从南越得到的奇草异木，如密香、指甲花、龙眼、荔枝、槟榔、橄榄和千岁桔等，也有张骞从西域带回来的葡萄和苜蓿等。动物如一般的鹿、獐等外，还有从西域和别处收罗来的如巨象、狮子、熊、大宛马、犛牛、白鹦鹉、紫鸳鸯等。
    苑中有许多宫观，如观象观，白鹿观、鳷鹊观、大台宫，这些都是关养动物的地方，相当于现在北京动物园中的熊猫馆等。一般鲜见而珍贵的动物，都给盖了房屋，有人专门饲养。如兔子之类，因为上林苑范围大，凭它们出入草丛之中，当作武帝打猎时的目标。
    苑中有一个昆明池，占地三百二十顷，其中养了许多鱼。另外也有一些小池如东陂池，西陂池，积草池和蒯池等，都是用来种植和放置一些花木。如蒯池种植蒯草（可供织席用），积草池中安放了一株珊瑚树，因为颜色鲜艳，被名为烽火树。
    被诗人夸赞为“润胜莲生水，鲜逾橘得霜”的荔枝，在上林苑中被精心培养。汉武帝特地造了一个扶荔宫来种植荔枝树，有数十个人来管理，注意保温，不让冻死。扶荔宫中另外也种植了一些南方的植物如龙眼、柑桔等，但是终于因为长安气候寒冷，成活率不高，活的也不结实。
    上林苑中的动、植物虽多，但比起我们今天的动、植物园来，却是不可同日而语的。被古人崇为瑞兽的麒麟（即长颈鹿）就没有。汉武帝想看鲸鱼，也只好把一块大石头雕成鲸鱼的样子放在昆明池中。
