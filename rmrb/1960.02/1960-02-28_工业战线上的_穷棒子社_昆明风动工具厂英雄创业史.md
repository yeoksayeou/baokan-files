The "Poor People's Cooperative" on the Industrial Front
——The Heroic Entrepreneurial History of Kunming Pneumatic Tool Factory
By our reporters Jin Yukun and Huang Changlu

    In the east end of Nanping Street, the most prosperous area in Kunming, a factory manufacturing precision equipment quietly emerged in a row of low and dilapidated bungalows.

    The factory is called Kunming Pneumatic Tool Factory.
    The Dispute Over the Signboard

    This factory was a product of the mass industrialization campaign during the Great Leap Forward. At the beginning of 1959, the province decided to build Kunming into Yunnan's industrial base, which required filling in many missing product categories. Yunnan is rich in non-ferrous metals, coal, iron and other mineral resources, and mines need a large number of pneumatic tools for mining, so pneumatic tools were one of the urgent gaps to be filled. When the city considered this issue, it thought of this small factory with great ambitions and decided to assign them this task.

    When this exciting news reached the factory, many old workers were moved and happily said, "The municipal party committee chose our dilapidated factory to undertake such an important task, which is simply too much trust in us! We must not fail the Party's trust in us, and we will make pneumatic tools even with hand files!" However, some people with serious conservative ideas were somewhat annoyed, "How can the municipal party committee be so ignorant of the situation, assigning us the task in such a confused manner!" Especially after inquiring, it was learned that there was only one factory in the country specializing in the manufacture of pneumatic tools, Shenyang, which possessed a complete set of new Soviet-made equipment and hundreds of technicians! Later, it was also heard that a famous large factory in Kunming had tried to produce this kind of pneumatic tool but failed. Therefore, they believed even more that "relying on our two dilapidated 'dancing lathes' and the only fourth-grade lathe operator to manufacture pneumatic tools is simply a fantasy!"

    Although the old workers did not believe these nonsense, they had never seen any pneumatic tools after all. Therefore, they suggested that the leaders invite an engineer to give a lecture. The factory invited an engineer Zhao from the Department of Mechanical Industry. When Engineer Zhao came to the factory, he did not say a word, just walked around the workshop, shaking his head and sighing as he walked. Finally, he turned around and said to Comrade Zhang Youfu, the branch secretary who accompanied him on the visit, "I have to tell you the truth. Pneumatic tools are relatively precise products in the mechanical industry. Judging from the current technical conditions of your factory, this is simply impossible!"

    Engineer Zhao's words made those with conservative ideas in the factory feel even more "justified". Therefore, when the Party branch and the old workers wanted to hang the signboard of the Pneumatic Tool Factory, they said, "No!" "Whether or not the signboard can be hung should be observed for at least ten months! If we hang it rashly now, how can we deal with it if people come to order goods?" Sure enough, soon the relevant departments of the central government notified the factory to attend a order placement conference. When the leadership wanted them to attend the meeting, they claimed to have a headache in the morning and refused to go; in the afternoon, they said they had a stomachache and could not go.

    When the old workers heard that they opposed hanging the signboard and refused to attend the order placement conference, they were very angry and demanded that the Party branch lead a debate with the conservatives: Can the signboard be hung? Can orders be accepted? Can pneumatic tools be manufactured? It is necessary to debate clearly!
      Starting with a Pair of Pliers

    This great debate began with the recollection of starting with a pair of pliers. In 1952, the factory had only seven old workers, including Nie Songbai, Huang Yunshun, and Xia Yizhi. At that time, the factory was a weighing instrument factory specializing in making wooden steelyards. The only tool in the factory was a pair of pliers. At that time, the factory had no money to buy raw materials, so the gray-haired old worker Huang Yunshun would carry a small basket and go to the second-hand stalls on Cuihua Street, which specialized in selling second-hand goods, to buy a basket of broken copper and scrap iron and produce for a month or two. Under such difficult conditions, the old workers were very enthusiastic. After working all day, they couldn't sleep at midnight. The seven old workers would get up from their beds one by one, often working until dawn.

    Why were they more enthusiastic under such difficult conditions? The seven old workers said that it was to fight for a good reputation! Before the "Five-Anti Campaign," they had all worked in factories owned by illegal capitalists making wooden steelyards and suffered enough oppression from the capitalists. In the past, the capitalists always scolded them as being worse than cattle and horses. "Now that the workers are masters of their own house, we must make a name for ourselves to show you capitalists!" With this spirit, the factory quickly developed from making wooden steelyards to making metal platform scales. During the First Five-Year Plan, it produced more than 9,000 platform scales for the country, basically meeting the needs of Kunming. By relying on "files and enthusiasm," in 1957, the quality of the platform scales produced by the factory even caught up with Shanghai and reached the level of Chongqing (platform scales produced in Chongqing were the best in the country at that time), and gained great credibility in the market.

    This experience is very valuable. It shows that as long as people have ambition, they have enthusiasm. With enthusiasm, they can overcome difficulties and get things done.

    When the Great Leap Forward began in 1958, the higher authorities requested the factory to develop into a hardware factory. To build a hardware factory, relying solely on a pair of pliers would not work. At that time, someone in the factory heard that Kunming Machine Tool Factory had a scrap warehouse, so the supply and marketing section chief immediately took people to buy more than 30 tons of scrap iron at nine cents per pound. After more than a month of hard work by the workers, they knocked, beat, patched, and pieced together two six-foot belt lathes and a small shaper. Because the parts were too dilapidated, these machine tools would shake and rattle incessantly when they were turned on. The workers gave their belt lathes a nickname: "dancing lathes." Only then did they have three pieces of machinery and equipment.

    At this time, the countryside was launching a high tide of realizing transportation cartization. The first task assigned to this hardware factory by the higher authorities was to manufacture wheelbarrows.

    In accepting this new task, opposition from conservative ideas was encountered from the beginning. They said, "In the past, we could cope with making platform scales by relying on 'files and enthusiasm,' but now we want to make wheelbarrows. Without welding equipment, without a large number of machine tools, can enthusiasm alone solve the problem?"

    The Party branch had only one way: find the masses. Therefore, a forum for old workers was held, and the difficulties of making wheelbarrows were listed on a sheet and given to the old workers for discussion. That night, the old workers came up with more than 200 suggestions and more than 10 manufacturing schemes for wheelbarrows. What if there is no welding? Old workers Luo Shude and Nie Songbai came up with a processing method that did not require a welding machine at all, and the quality was better than welding. They also saved 70% of working hours, and the cost was reduced by half. What if there is no lathe for processing the copper sleeves on the bearings, or even no copper? Old worker Fu Qichang came up with a method to cast alloy sleeves with lead alloy, and the wear resistance was stronger than copper sleeves. You come up with an idea, and I think of a solution, and the wheelbarrows were made again. Moreover, the quality was good, and the cost was low.

    Then, they threw themselves into the mass movement of全民大办钢铁 [the entire population engaging in steel production]. In the face of new problems, the conservatives reiterated their old tune: no technology, no equipment... exaggerating the difficulties.

    The Party branch made full use of the experience of making wheelbarrows, handed the problem over to the masses for discussion, and let them draw their own conclusions. During the discussion, old workers Xia Yizhi and Nie Songbai asked those with conservative ideas to answer the following question:

    "How was the world's first furnace of steel smelted? In the world, did smelting technology come before the first furnace of steel was smelted, or did the first furnace of steel come first, and then smelting technology was produced?"

    This sharp question left the conservatives speechless. At the same time, it enlightened all the workers in the factory, making them deeply realize that experience can only be generated after doing anything in the world.

    Once one aperture is opened, all apertures are opened. The factory built three converters in seven days. When the first molten steel flowed out, the red molten steel flowed, and the old workers shed tears of excitement. Under the hard work of the branch secretary and the factory director, half of the workers in the factory quickly mastered steelmaking technology, overfulfilling the steelmaking task every month, and were continuously rated as an advanced steelmaking unit in the city for three consecutive times.

    Through the mass steelmaking campaign, the workers' minds were further liberated, and their ambitions became even greater. Therefore, in the movement to fight great battles of machine tools in the same year, the conservatives said, "How can you lay eggs without a hen!" Their answer was: "Even without a hen, we have to make it lay eggs!" By the end of the year, relying on three dilapidated machine tools, they manufactured 463 units of winches, shearing machines, electric saws, precision bench drills and other equipment.

    In the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, they relied on "files and enthusiasm" to overcome difficulties four times in a row, increasing the total output value by three and a half times compared with 1957, and successively received 29 red flags awarded by the province and city.
          Make the Water Flow Upwards

    The facts of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 made people see their own strength and believe in the great role of human subjective initiative. However, Comrade Zhang Youfu, the branch secretary, felt that this was not enough and that this kind of perceptual knowledge needed to be elevated to the height of rationality, based on his own experience in studying "On Contradiction" and "On Practice." Therefore, he gave lectures on philosophy to the workers, especially repeatedly talking about the relationship between human subjective initiative and objective laws.

    After this lecture, "the role of human subjective initiative" became the most widely discussed topic in the factory. Some people discussed, "Water always flows downwards, which is an objective law; but the Soviet Union built the Lenin Canal, which made the Volga River flow upwards. This is the role of human subjective initiative!" Others said, "A kitchen knife is not as good as guns and cannons, but the revolutionaries initially relied on a kitchen knife to make revolution and defeated the counter-revolutionaries holding guns and cannons. This is the role of human subjective initiative!" Still others said, "Didn't we lay eggs last year without a hen! We made wheelbarrows, smelted steel, and made machines. Isn't this all because we exerted subjective initiative?" With such discussions, an atmosphere of despising difficulties formed in the factory. As soon as anyone emphasized any difficulties, someone would immediately ask, "Where has your subjective initiative gone?" They said, "Difficulties are just paper tigers, specializing in bullying lazy people and cowards!"

    After such study, the workers' confidence was greatly increased, and the unanimous conclusion was: the signboard must be hung, the orders must be accepted, and the pneumatic tools must be made! That night, the old workers really couldn't sit still. The seven old workers wrote, carved, and painted themselves. The next morning, a signboard with white characters on a red background that read "Kunming Pneumatic Tool Factory" was hung high at the factory gate.

    As things began, difficulties followed. In the past, making platform scales mainly depended on foundry workers and forging workers. Now, making pneumatic tools requires relying on precision turning, precision grinding, precision processing, and heat treatment. In the past, products were considered qualified even if they differed by two or three millimeters, but now they must be scrapped if they differ by half a silk (i.e., 0.05% of one millimeter). It was certainly not easy to take this step.

    The branch secretary and factory director of this factory were both newly promoted worker cadres with less leadership experience and methods, but they had a good tradition. No matter what they were doing or what difficulties they encountered, they always liked to discuss with the masses, especially with the old workers. In this way, many things that could not be done were done, and difficulties became non-difficult. Therefore, they gradually had a deep understanding: the more difficult the task and the more serious the difficulties, the more important it is to discuss with the masses; difficulties are most afraid of the masses, and as long as the masses rise up, any difficulties will not stand! Especially after studying the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, they understood more deeply that the mass line is the Party's basic line and the key to the success or failure of all undertakings. From then on, they applied the mass line in their work more consciously. In the process of manufacturing pneumatic tools, they relied on this magic weapon to overcome a series of difficulties.

    The first difficulty encountered at the beginning was the lack of an internal grinding machine for grinding the inner circle of the pneumatic pickaxe's cylinder. After research, the Party branch decided to hand over the difficulty to the masses and take this as the starting point for launching a large-scale mass movement. The Party branch immediately convened a general meeting of all employees in a grass shed. The branch secretary called on everyone to come up with solutions and "show their unique abilities like the Eight Immortals crossing the sea." Each person was given a pickaxe cylinder on the spot, and they were required to find a way to grind the inner circle without using an internal grinding machine. At this meeting, all the employees of the factory came up with more than 400 suggestions, averaging two suggestions per person. By the time the meeting adjourned, it was already 7:00 p.m., but no one went home. People flocked to the workshop. Whether they were forging workers, foundry workers, lathe operators, or fitters, or whether they were workers or cadres, they were all holding a pneumatic pickaxe cylinder in their hands, racking their brains and trying to find a solution. Some people were pulling with ropes, some were pedaling with their feet, some were driving with belts, and some were installing sandpaper wheels on drilling machines instead of grinding machines, or clamping raw iron grinding rods on vises... Suddenly, all kinds of "homemade grinding machines" sprang up all over the factory like mushrooms after rain. The branch secretary and the factory director also moved their bedding to the workshop and fought hard with everyone. When the branch secretary discovered that the method created by old worker Zhou Wenyuan to grind the inner circle of the pickaxe cylinder with a clay grinding wheel was the best, he immediately convened an on-site meeting to promote it. At two o'clock in the morning, all the belts on the lathes were broken. The workers untied more than 40 belts from their bodies to replace them, so that the lathes continued to rotate. By seven o'clock the next afternoon, the inner circles of the fifty pickaxe cylinders had all been ground.

    Next, old worker Nie Songbai centralized the various experiences created by the masses and transformed two internal grinding machines using lathes. This kind of indigenous equipment collectively created by the workers had a very good processing effect, and the problem of grinding the inner circle was easily solved.

    With the initial victory, the Party branch took advantage of the situation to launch a mass movement to build indigenous equipment on a large scale throughout the factory. The pickaxe cylinder of the pneumatic pickaxe needs to be drilled with a long hole of 237 millimeters, which requires a large drilling machine of more than two meters. The factory sent people to run all over dozens of factories in the city, and finally managed to find a one-meter-high drilling machine in one factory. Two master craftsmen worked hard for two days and two nights to drill holes in only two pickaxe cylinders, and one was scrapped. This was obviously not a long-term solution, and the solution still had to come from their own brains. Sure enough, as soon as the old workers used their brains, the solution came out. They used a horizontal eccentric shaft to create a long-hole drilling machine. It only takes 35 minutes to drill a long hole, increasing efficiency by 68 times. It used to be that only a sixth-grade master craftsman could master it, but now apprentices who had just entered the factory can operate it.

    There were so many difficulties during this period. The pickaxe cylinder of the pneumatic pickaxe needed to be drilled with some internal holes, but the factory did not have a machine tool for drilling internal holes. The Party branch again handed this topic over to the old workers. At two o'clock this night, the branch secretary saw that there was still light in the workshop. He walked in and saw old worker Shi Benmin looking down, engrossed in watching a disassembled watch placed on a vise. The branch secretary knew that this was a new watch that Shi Benmin had just bought. Usually, he would wipe it again and again if there was a little dust on the watch. Why did he disassemble the watch and put it on the vise now?

    "Teacher, what are you doing?" the branch secretary stepped forward and asked.

    "I want to make an internal hole drilling machine."

    "Why did you take the watch apart too?"

    "I want to use the principle of the gears turning inside the watch to solve the problem of drilling holes from inside the pickaxe cylinder."

    "That's a good idea!" The branch secretary was attracted by his idea: "What kind of help do you need? What materials do you need? The branch will fully support you."

    The next day, the branch sent two technicians to form a three-way combination group. After seven days of hard work, they made the internal hole drilling machine. Using this machine tool to drill the internal holes of the pickaxe cylinder only requires one process, fifteen minutes to drill one hole, and the work efficiency is increased by 192 times.

    The employees of the entire factory used this heroic spirit of "passing five passes and slaying six generals" to successively create 22 indigenous special-purpose equipment and come up with more than 200 sets of tooling jigs, so that every process of making pneumatic pickaxes and processing every part had process equipment. They fulfilled their promise: without spending a penny of state funds and without asking for a single technician, they equipped themselves.
          Between Success and Failure

    The first batch of pneumatic pickaxes was born.

    However, the results of the experiment showed that the pneumatic pickaxe could sound upwards, but was silent downwards, and did not work.

    The first batch of pneumatic pickaxes failed.

    Therefore, those with conservative ideas once again confidently said, "See, I said it definitely wouldn't work. How can you make any pneumatic tools with these indigenous things!"

    The workers felt a lot of pressure, but the branch secretary encouraged everyone: successful experience is certainly valuable, but failed experience is also useful to us. We are not afraid of people laughing at us, and final victory must be ours.

    As a result of careful inspection by the old workers, it was found that the main problem with this batch of products was insufficient accuracy and air leakage. Why was the accuracy insufficient? The workers' technical level could not adapt.

    Therefore, the branch decided to launch a mass movement to improve the technical level. They treated the workshop as a classroom, implemented live-fire training, and called on all employees to march towards technology! Each master craftsman took five to ten apprentices, the eldest apprentice took the second apprentice, and the second apprentice took the third apprentice. Guan Zhengrong, the only fourth-grade lathe operator in the factory, sometimes had to give eight technical lessons a day. Many young apprentices saved their breakfast money to buy technical manuals, and they ate while reading; before meetings, they used chalk to draw on the ground using a few minutes of time; before going to bed, they insisted on studying for two hours. Many types of work did not exist in the factory in the past, so the workers explored and learned on their own. Whoever mastered it first would take apprentices. After labor model Nong Dingfang mastered milling technology, he trained seven milling workers. As a result of vigorously launching mass movements, fourteen new types of work were cultivated among those whom some people thought were "incapable of success". Among them, the number of lathe operators grew from one to one hundred and twenty, and the average technical level of all employees in the factory reached third-grade.

    Based on this foundation, the second batch of pneumatic pickaxes was made. This batch of pneumatic pickaxes made progress. They could sound upwards and in all directions, but they were still mute when pointing downwards.

    After summarizing and researching together with the old workers, the branch found that the problem with the second batch of products was insufficient hardness because the heat treatment was not done well. Originally, according to the drawings, pneumatic tools needed to be quenched in an electric furnace, but the factory used an indigenous furnace instead, and there was no instrument to check, so the temperature was not easy to control accurately, which affected the hardness of the product. Therefore, in the trial production of the third batch of products, the branch mobilized all employees of the factory to do everything possible to overcome the heat treatment problem. The workers came up with many poor ideas. They hung a blackboard next to the quenching furnace. Each time a part was processed, they carefully observed what color the flame was burning into, and what temperature the flame burned into at each color, and then painted this color on the blackboard. After dozens of experiments, everyone summed up and discussed the experimental records, and came up with a rule: for what steel material and what parts, what color the flame needs to be burned into in order to be qualified. Then this experiment was compiled into technical operating procedures. In this way, the problem of the temperature being too high or too low during heat treatment affecting the hardness of the product was solved, and the pass rate reached more than 98%.

    The third batch of products was manufactured. After a test, they could sound upwards, downwards, and in all directions, but they had no strength when they were installed with a drill rod.

    Three consecutive failures caused great fluctuations in the factory. Those with conservative ideas said aggressively, "If you continue like this, you won't even be able to pay your wages. You have wasted so much state property. Don't you feel heartache? We are going to report you to the municipal party committee and the district party committee." The old workers felt very sad, and some young people were also shaken. At this crucial moment, everyone was waiting for a word from the branch secretary. If the branch secretary said "it's not working," then the spirit of the entire factory would be lost at once. In this difficult time, the higher-level party committee has been encouraging them to persist. Therefore, the Party branch found the old workers to hold a meeting. At the meeting, the branch secretary spoke: "We have failed three times, and there are many difficulties. However, when any new thing appears in the world, we have never heard of it not encountering difficulties. If they want to report us, let them report! If the product is successfully made, it is everyone's achievement; if it fails, the branch will take all the responsibility! We must prepare to fail it a hundred times, and do it two hundred times!"

    With the support of the branch, the old workers' confidence immediately increased, and they became even more energetic. Old worker Nie Songbai, who was 54 years old, worked until after one o'clock in the morning. He didn't feel tired at all, and became more and more energetic. He led the workers in singing "Socialism is good..."

    The main problem with the third batch of products was that the sizes of the parts were not uniform, some were tall and some were short, some were thick and some were thin, and they could not be matched. The reason for the non-uniform sizes was the lack of strict inspection work. Therefore, the factory built a large number of inspection tools such as gauges and calipers, and required strict processing according to the drawings, strengthened the inspection of parts, and organized old workers to study the problem of eliminating defective products. In this way, the accuracy, hardness, and smoothness of the fourth batch of products were all qualified. The factory was rated as an advanced unit in the city's quality evaluation.
      Engineer Zhao is Enlightened

    One day in July 1959, the factory held a celebration meeting for the successful manufacture of pneumatic tools. Representatives from the Provincial Construction Engineering Department, the Mechanical Industry Department, and many mines came to participate. At the meeting, an old miner gave a technical operation performance on the spot. After the performance, he said with emotion, "Now our Yunnan can also manufacture its own pneumatic tools, which is a great support for our mines!" The relevant departments immediately identified that the six key projects (precision turning, precision grinding, precision processing, heat treatment, and drilling and hardness) had all reached the national technical standards.

    Engineer Zhao from the Mechanical Industry Department, who had come before, also came this time. After listening to the old miner's speech, he couldn't sit still any longer. He sneaked into the workshop alone to count the machines. While everyone was still expressing their opinions on product quality, he stood up and spoke: "To be honest, I never believed that you could make pneumatic tools. Even when I came to attend this meeting today, I still didn't believe it. After watching the old miner's operation performance just now, I thought you had probably added a lot of foreign equipment. However, I ran to the workshop and counted again and again, and it was still those dilapidated machines, just a few more indigenous equipment. This is what enlightened me. This matter has been a great education for me, really great!"

    In the face of vivid facts, many people with conservative ideas in the factory also had great changes. Yang Peiyan, the production planning section chief, originally did not believe that pneumatic tools could be made. He now believes that "the enthusiasm of the masses cannot be counted with numbers", and "if we don't catch up, we will become a waste product in the Great Leap Forward!" From then on, he actively changed the conservative style in his planning work, created an advanced method of "tracking dispatch", and also worked and engaged in technical innovation with the workers, making many contributions, and was rated as a model of technical management cadres in the factory. Ju Dingjun, the supply and marketing section chief who originally did not dare to participate in the order placement conference, later reluctantly accepted the order, but had been sweating for half a year. This time, he said, "Now I will resolutely support what the masses say they can do. Even if everyone wants me to pick the moon down, I must find a way to go to heaven!" As the facts showed, the supply work in the second half of the year was very outstanding, ensuring that production turned up, and most of the raw materials were solved by their own means, so he was rated as a labor model of the factory.

    In 1959, the factory had manufactured four kinds of pneumatic tools: pneumatic picks, pneumatic shovels, rock drills, and tampers. In terms of quality, it had reached the level of Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, and the cost was also close to the level of Shenyang. In this year, the state planned to produce 600 pneumatic tools, but actually completed 720 units, and the labor productivity of all employees increased by 70%. Therefore, in this year, the factory received 52 prize flags awarded by the province and city and gloriously attended the National Congress of Heroes.
          Seven Evergreen Pines

    When entering 1960, the Party branch proposed new and higher goals for the entire factory, requiring the production of 6,000 pneumatic tools this year without increasing the number of people, which is nearly ten times that of last year. All the employees of the factory also made great ambitions, choosing Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, which has a complete set of new technology and equipment, as the object of learning and catching up with, and planned to catch up with it in several main indicators such as the cost and labor quota of the pneumatic pickaxe before the May 1st Labor Day this year; and to catch up with it in terms of the average output per person within three years.

    Therefore, they put forward a heroic slogan: We must build a modern pneumatic tool factory with our own hands! In order to realize this slogan, they built foreign equipment on a large scale. Recently, they only spent 24 days to build a universal machine tool that can be used for five purposes: turning, boring, grinding, milling, and drilling. This machine tool can automatically lift and lower, automatically feed the tool, and reverse and start. It can process large workpieces weighing more than one ton. Even the engineers from Kunming Machine Tool Factory, which specializes in manufacturing precision machine tools, said with deep feeling after visiting: "It would take our factory half a year to design this kind of machine tool alone. You are simply gods!" In the first quarter, they planned to build 24 such foreign equipment to further arm themselves.

    Since the establishment of this factory in 1952, it has not spent a penny of state investment in eight years, but it has paid profits to the state every year. The fixed assets of the factory when it was first established, adding up a few broken steelyard poles, was no more than a hundred yuan, but in the two years of 1958 and 1959 alone, it paid profits of 520,000 yuan. The number of factory personnel has increased to more than 260. Under the influence of the seven old workers, this factory has maintained the tradition of hard work and thrift for eight years as if it were only a day. Now, in addition to a few simple factory buildings built by the workers themselves and a large grass shed as a auditorium and dining hall, everything else is the same as before.

    Now, people always like to compare the seven old workers to "seven evergreen pines." Not long ago, four of the "seven evergreen pines" had been transferred to fraternal factories to take on heavier tasks. Yang Maochun, Chen Fa, and Haimingjing have respectively served as the directors of the Second Hardware Factory, the Stationery Hardware Factory, and the Vehicle Factory. Xia Yizhi is the chairman of the labor union in the Second Hardware Factory. Whenever they encounter any difficulties in their new positions, they always like to return to their "mother's house" to discuss with the branch secretary; if the workers have any ideological obstacles, they bring them to visit the Pneumatic Tool Factory. Once they visit, their minds are enlightened, and they resolutely take the road of the Pneumatic Tool Factory, using their own means to arm themselves to build the factory. Therefore, the coppersmith's burden became a factory for making locks, the steel pen repair stall developed into a hardware factory, and the bicycle repair shop also became a vehicle factory. People say, "Wherever the people from the Pneumatic Tool Factory go, the leap forward flowers bloom!"

    Now, Kunming Pneumatic Tool Factory has become a model and source of encouragement for many factories in Yunnan. Kunming Pneumatic Tool Factory is the "Poor People's Cooperative" on our industrial front, and the branch secretary and the seven old workers of this factory are also the "Wang Guofan" on the industrial front. Relying on the great ambitions of Marxism-Leninism, they have written the most vivid side of the 650 million "poor people" running industry for us. (Attached picture)

    工业战线上的“穷棒子社”
    ——昆明风动工具厂英雄创业史
    本报记者　金雨困　黄昌禄
    在昆明最繁华的南屏街东头，一排低矮破烂的小平房里，悄悄地诞生了一座制造精密设备的工厂。
    这座工厂的名字，叫昆明风动工具厂。	  挂牌之争
    这个工厂是大跃进中全民办工业的产物。1959年年初，省里决定把昆明市建为云南的工业基地，这就需要把许多缺门产品补上。云南的有色金属和煤、铁等矿产资源都很丰富，矿山需要大量的风动工具来开采，因此风动工具是迫切需要补上的缺门之一。市里考虑这个问题时，就想到了这个抱有雄心大志的小工厂，决定把这个任务交给他们来担负。
    当这个令人兴奋的消息传到厂里时，许多老工人听了都很感动、很高兴地说：“这样重要的任务，市委偏偏选中我们这个破烂的厂子来承担，简直是太信任我们了！我们决不能辜负党对我们的信任，用手锉也要把风动工具制造出来！”但是一些有严重保守思想的人，却感到有些恼火：“市委怎么这样不了解情况，糊里糊涂就把任务交给我们了！”特别是一打听，全国专门制造风动工具的只有沈阳一家，人家拥有整套苏联制造的新型装备，技术人员也有好几百！后来又听说昆明有一家著名的大工厂，曾经试制过这种风动工具，也没有成功，因此更认为：“靠我们两部破烂的‘跳舞车床’和唯一的一个四级车工，要制造什么风动工具，简直是异想天开！”
    老工人虽然不信这些鬼话，但毕竟也没有看见过什么风动工具，因此建议领导请个工程师来讲讲。厂里就从机械工业厅请来了一位赵工程师。这位赵工程师来到厂里，一声气也不吭，光在车间里转来转去，一边转一边摇头叹气。直到末了，才转过身来对陪他参观的支部书记张有富同志说：“我得告诉你老实话，风动工具是机械工业中比较精密的产品，就你们厂目前的技术条件来看，这是根本不可能的！”
    赵工程师这么一说，使厂里有保守思想的人觉得更加“理直气壮”了。因此党支部和老工人要把风动工具厂的招牌挂出去，他们说：“不成！”“能不能挂招牌，至少要看他十个月！现在冒冒失失挂出去，如果人家来订货，怎么对付？”果然不久，中央有关部门就通知这个厂去参加订货会议了。当领导上要他们去参加会议时，上午他们推说头疼不去；下午又说是肚子疼，去不成了。
    老工人听说他们反对挂牌，又拒绝参加订货会议，都很气愤，要求党支部领导同保守派开展一场辩论：究竟能不能挂牌？能不能接受订货？能不能造出风动工具？一定要辩个明白！
      一把老虎钳起家
    这场大辩论是由回忆一把老虎钳起家开始的。1952年的时候，这个工厂只有聂松柏、黄云顺、夏宜之等七个老工人。当时这座工厂是专做木杆秤的衡器厂，厂里唯一的工具就是一把老虎钳。当时厂里没有钱买原材料，白发斑斑的老工人黄云顺就带上个小提篮，跑到专卖旧货的翠花街旧货摊上买它一篮破铜烂铁，生产上个把月。就在这样艰苦的条件下，老工人的干劲却大得很。白天干了一天，半夜里睡不着了，七个老工人又一个一个地从被窝里爬起来，往往一直干到天亮。
    为什么条件这样艰苦，他们的干劲反而更大呢？七个老工人的说法是：就是为了要争一口气！原来在“五反”之前，他们都在不法资本家的工厂里做木杆秤，受够了资本家的欺压。过去，资本家一直骂他们比牛马都不如。“现在工人自己当家作主了，一定要干出个名堂来给你们资本家看看！”就凭着这股气，工厂迅速由做木杆秤发展到做金属台秤，在第一个五年计划期间，为国家生产了九千多架台秤，基本上满足了昆明市的需要。就凭着“锉刀加干劲”，在1957年，这个厂出产的台秤还在质量上赶上了上海，达到重庆的水平（重庆生产的台秤在当时是全国最好的），在市场上获得了极大的信誉。
    这个经验是非常宝贵的。它说明：人只要有了志气，就有了干劲，有了干劲，就可以克服困难把事办成。
    1958年开始大跃进时，上级要求这个工厂发展成为五金工厂。要建成为一个制造五金的工厂，光靠一把老虎钳是不成的。当时，厂里有人听说昆明机床厂有个废品仓库，供销股长马上带人去，用九分钱一斤，买了三十多吨废铁回来，经过工人们一个多月的苦战，把这些废铁敲敲打打、拼拼凑凑搞起了两部六尺皮带车床和一部小牛头刨床。由于零件太破烂了，这些机床一开动，就摇摇晃晃，格达格达地响个不停。工人们给他们的皮带车床起了个外号，叫“跳舞车床”。这样才算有了三台机器设备。
    这时，农村正掀起了实现运输车子化的热潮。上级给这个五金厂的第一个任务，就是制造小推车。
    在接受这个新的任务时，一开头就遇到了保守思想的反对。他们说：过去做台秤，靠“锉刀加干劲”还能应付；现在要做小推车，没有电焊设备，没有大量机床，光靠干劲能顶事吗？
    支部的办法也只有一条，找群众。于是召开了老工人座谈会，把做小推车的困难，列成了一张单子交给老工人讨论。当天晚上，老工人就提出了二百多条意见，十多种制造小推车的方案。没有电焊怎么办？老工人罗树德和聂松柏想出了一个根本不用电焊机的加工方法，质量比电焊的还好，还节约了70％的工时，成本也降低了一半。做轴承上的铜套，没有车床加工，甚至连铜也没有，怎么办？老工人傅其昌想出一个办法，用铅合金浇铸出了合金套，耐磨力比铜套还强。你出一个主意，我想一个办法，又把小推车做出来了，而且质量好，成本低。
    接着，就投入了全民大办钢铁的群众运动。在新的问题面前，保守派又旧调重弹：一无技术，二无设备……，把事情讲得困难重重。
    支部充分运用了搞小推车的经验，把问题交给群众去讨论，让他们自己来作结论。在讨论中，老工人夏宜之和聂松柏请有保守思想的人回答这样一个问题：
    “世上的第一炉钢是怎么炼出来的？在世界上，是先有了炼钢技术，才炼出第一炉钢来呢？还是先炼出了第一炉钢，才产生炼钢技术的？”
    这个尖锐的问题把保守派问得哑口无言。同时也启发了全厂职工，使他们深刻地认识到：世界上任何事情都是要干起来后才能产生经验。
    一窍通了百窍通。厂里七天中就建起了三座转炉。当第一炉钢水奔流出来的时候，通红的钢水流着，老工人激动的眼泪也流着。在支部书记和厂长带头苦战下，全厂很快有一半工人掌握了炼钢技术，月月超额完成炼钢任务，连续三次被评为全市的炼钢先进单位。
    通过全民炼钢，工人的思想更解放了，志气也就更大了。因此，在同年大战机床的运动中，保守派说：“没有母鸡，怎能下蛋！”他们的回答是：“没有母鸡，也要叫它下蛋！”到年底，就凭三台烂机床造出了卷扬机、剪板机、电动锯床、精密台钻等四百六十三台。
    在大跃进的1958年，他们就凭着“锉刀加干劲”，连破四次难关，使总产值比1957年增长三倍半，先后得到省、市奖给的红旗二十九面。
          叫水往上流
    1958年大跃进的事实，使人们看见了自己的力量，相信了人的主观能动性的伟大作用。但是，支部书记张有富同志根据自己学习“矛盾论”和“实践论”的体会，觉得这样还不够，还需要把这种感性认识提高到理性的高度。因此，他就向职工大讲哲学，特别是反复讲了人的主观能动性和客观规律的关系。
    经过这样一讲，“人的主观能动作用”就成了厂里最广泛的议题。有的人议论说：“水总是往下流的，这是客观规律性；但是苏联修了一条列宁运河，就叫伏尔加河往上流，这就是人的主观能动作用！”又有人说：“菜刀不如枪炮，但是当初革命者靠了一把菜刀闹革命，打败了持枪炮的反革命，这就是人的主观能动作用！”还有人说：“去年我们没有母鸡，不是也生下了蛋！搞出了小推车，炼出了钢，造出了机器，这不都是因为发挥了主观能动作用吗？”这样议论纷纷，厂里就形成了一种蔑视困难的空气，只要谁强调什么困难，马上就有人问道：“你的主观能动性到哪里去了？”他们说：“困难是只纸老虎，专欺懒汉和懦夫！”
    经过这样的学习，工人们信心倍增，大家一致的结论是：牌子一定要挂，订货一定要接，风动工具一定要做出来！这一夜，老工人们实在坐不住了，七个老工人自己写，自己刻，自己油漆。第二天清早，一块白底红字的“昆明风动工具厂”的招牌就高高地挂在了工厂大门口。
    事情一开始，困难也就接踵而来。过去做台秤，主要是靠铸工、锻工吃饭的，现在做风动工具，就得靠精车、精磨、精加工和热处理了；过去产品差个两、三公厘都算合格，而现在差个半丝（即一公厘的0．05％）就得报废。要迈过这一步，确不是轻而易举的。
    这个厂的支部书记和厂长都是新提拔的工人干部，领导经验和办法都较少，但是他们有一个好传统，不管作任何事情或遇到了什么困难，总是喜欢和群众特别是和老工人商量。这样，许多办不通的事情就办通了，困难也就变成不困难了。因而，他们逐渐有了深切的体会：任务越是艰巨，困难越是严重，就越要和群众商量；困难是最怕群众的，只要群众起来了，任何困难都站不住脚！特别是他们学习了毛泽东选集后，更加懂得了群众路线是党的基本路线，群众路线是一切事业的成败关键，从此他们在工作中运用群众路线便更加自觉了。在制造风动工具的过程中，他们就依靠这个法宝克服了一系列的困难。
    一开始遇到的第一个困难，是没有磨风镐镐筒的内圆磨床。支委会研究以后，决定把困难交给群众，并以此作为大搞群众运动的起点。支委会立即在草棚里召开了全体职工大会，支部书记号召大家想办法，“八仙过海，各显神通”。当场发给每人一个镐筒，要求大家去找出不用内圆磨床磨内圆的办法。在这个会上，全厂职工就提出了四百多条意见，平均每个人提了两条。散会时，已是晚上七点钟，但是没有人回家去。人们都涌向车间，不管是锻工、铸工、车工还是钳工，也不管是工人和干部，手里都抱着一个风镐的镐筒在动脑筋，想办法。有的人用绳子在拉，有的人用脚在蹬，有的用皮带带动，也有的在钻床上安上皮砂轮代替磨床，或者在老虎钳上夹上生铁研磨杆……顿时各式各样的“土磨床”像雨后春笋一样遍布了全厂。支部书记和厂长也把铺盖搬到了车间，同大家一道苦战。当支部书记发现老工人周文源创造的用土砂轮磨镐筒内圆的办法最好，就马上召开现场会议推广。深夜两点钟了，车床上的皮带断完了，工人从身上解下四十多根皮带来代替，使车床又继续转动。到第二天下午七点钟，五十个镐筒的内圆全部磨好了。
    接着，老工人聂松柏把群众创造的各种经验集中起来，用车床改造了两部内圆磨床。这种工人集体创造的土设备，加工的效果很好，磨内圆的问题迎刃而解了。
    初战告捷，支部就因势利导，在全厂掀起一个大搞土设备的群众运动。风镐镐筒要打一个二百三十七米厘的长眼，要用两米以上的大钻床才能加工，厂里派人跑遍了市里几十家工厂，最后好容易才在一家厂里找到了一台一米高的钻床，两个老师傅整整搞了两天两夜，才打出了两个镐筒的眼，而且还报废了一个。这显然不是长久之计，办法还是要靠自己动脑筋。果然，老工人一动脑筋，办法就出来了。他们用卧式偏心轴造出了一部长孔打眼机。只要三十五分钟就可打好一个长眼，效率提高了六十八倍。原来要六级老师傅才能掌握，现在进厂不久的学工都可以操作了。
    这段时间的困难真是太多。风镐的镐筒需要打些内孔，厂里却没有打内孔的机床，支部又把这个课题交给了老工人。这天夜里两点钟了，支部书记看见车间里还有灯光，走进去看见老工人师本民低着头，正在入神地望着老虎钳上摆的一只拆开了的表。支部书记知道这是师本民新买的一只手表，平时表上沾点灰，他都抹了又抹，现在怎么把表拆开摆在老虎钳上呢？
    “老师，你在搞哪样？”支部书记上前去问。
    “我想搞一个内孔打眼机。”
    “为什么把表也拆开了？”
    “我想用手表里面齿轮转动的原理，来解决从镐筒内打眼的问题。”
    “想得好！”支部书记被他这个想法吸引住了：“你需要什么人帮助？要些什么材料？支部全力支持你。”
    第二天，支部派了两个技工来，成立了一个三结合小组，苦战了七天，就造出了内孔打眼机。用这种机床打镐筒的内孔，只消一道工序，十五分钟打一个眼，工效提高一百九十二倍。
    全厂职工就用这种“过五关，斩六将”的英雄气魄，先后造出了二十二台土专用设备，搞出了二百多套工模夹具，使做风镐的每一道工序，加工每一个零件，都有了工艺装备。他们实现了自己的诺言：没有花国家一文钱，没有要一个技术人员，便自己装备了自己。
          成败之间
    第一批风镐诞生了。
    但是试验的结果，这种风镐朝天能响，朝地却无声，不管事。
    第一批风镐失败了。
    于是有保守思想的人又振振有辞：“你看，我说肯定是搞不成的，靠这些土玩意哪能搞什么风动工具！”
    工人感到压力很大，但支部书记却鼓励大家：成功的经验固然宝贵，失败的经验对我们也有用。我们不怕人笑，最后的胜利一定是我们的。
    老工人认真检查的结果，发现这批产品主要问题是精度不够，漏风。精度为什么不够呢？工人的技术水平不能适应。
  于是支部决定在提高技术水平上也要大搞群众运动，把车间当课堂，实行火线练兵，号召全厂职工向技术进军！每个老师傅都带上了五个到十个徒弟，大徒弟带二徒弟，二徒弟带三徒弟。全厂唯一的四级车工管正荣，有时一天要讲八次技术课。许多小学工都省下早点钱买技工手册，吃饭时，也是一边吃一边看；开会前，利用几分钟时间用粉笔在地上划来划去；临睡前，还要坚持学习两小时。许多工种是厂里过去根本没有的，工人就自己来摸索学习，谁先掌握谁就带徒弟。劳动模范侬鼎芳掌握了铣工技术后，又培养了七个铣工。大搞群众运动的结果，就在有的人认为这些“不能成事的娃娃”中培养出了十四个新工种，其中车工就由一个发展到一百二十个，全厂职工达到平均三级工的技术水平。
    就在这个基础上造出了第二批风镐。这批风镐有了进步，朝天响，朝四面也响，但是朝地还是一个哑巴。
    支部同老工人一起总结研究后，发现第二批产品的毛病是硬度不够，原因是热处理没有搞好。本来按图纸要求，风动工具是需要电炉淬火的，但厂里用土炉来代替，又没有仪器检查，所以火候不易掌握准，影响了产品硬度。于是，在试制第三批产品中，支部发动全厂职工千方百计攻热处理关。工人们想了许多穷主意。他们在淬火炉旁挂了一块黑板，每处理一个零件，就细心观察火焰烧成什么颜色了，烧到什么颜色，就是烧到多少度，然后把这个颜色涂在黑板上。经过几十次试验，大家把试验的记录综合起来，讨论研究，就摸出了一条规律：什么钢材、什么零件，需要把火焰烧成什么颜色就合格了。然后把这个试验编成技术操作规程。这样就解决了热处理时温度过高或过低而影响产品硬度的问题，合格率达到了98％以上。
    第三批产品制造出来了。一试，朝天、朝地、朝四面八方都会响了，但安上扦子打，却没有劲儿了。
    连续三次失败，在厂里引起了极大的波动。有保守思想的人气势汹汹地说：“你们这样搞下去，工资也要发不出了，浪费了这么多的国家财产，你们不感到心痛？我们可要到市委、区委告你们去。”老工人听了很难过，有些青年也有些动摇。在这个骨节眼上，大家就等着支部书记的一句话了。支部书记如果说“不行了”，那么全厂的气就会一下子泄掉。在这个困难的时候，上级党委一直鼓励他们坚持下去。于是党支部就把老工人们都找来开会，会上支部书记讲了话：“我们失败了三次，困难是很多的。但是，世界上任何新事物出现时，从没有听到说不遭到困难的。他们要告状，由他们去告！产品做成功了，是大家的成绩；万一失败了，一切责任由支部承当！我们要准备它再失败一百次，再干它二百次！”
    老工人有了支部的撑腰，信心马上又高了起来，劲头也更足了。五十四岁的老工人聂松柏干到深夜一点多钟，一点也不觉疲劳，越干越得劲，就带着工人们唱起“社会主义好……”。
    第三批产品主要是零件尺寸不合，高高矮矮，粗粗细细，不能配套。而不合尺寸的原因是缺乏严格的检验工作。因此厂里就大造量规、卡尺等检验工具，并要求严格按照图纸加工，加强零件的检验工作，还组织老工人专门研究消灭废品的问题。这样，第四批产品的精度、硬度、光洁度都合格。工厂在全市质量评比中被评为先进单位。
      赵工程师开窍了
    1959年7月的一天，厂里举行风动工具制造成功庆祝大会。省建筑工程厅、机械工业厅和许多矿山都派代表来参加。会上，由一位老矿工当场作技术操作表演，表演结束后，他感动地说：“现在我们云南也能自己制造风动工具了，这对我们矿山的支持太大了！”有关部门当场鉴定认为六大关键项目（精车、精磨、精加工、热处理和打眼、硬度）都已达到了国家的技术标准。
    上次来过的那位机械工业厅的赵工程师，这次也来了。他听了老矿工的发言后，再也坐不住了，一个人悄悄溜到车间去数机器。大家还在对产品质量发表意见的时候，他就站起来讲话：“说老实话，我一直不相信你们能做出风动工具来。就是今天来参加这个会时，我也还不信。刚才看了老矿工的操作表演后，我以为你们大概是增加了不少洋设备。可是，我跑到车间里，数来数去，还是那些破机器，就多了几台土设备，这才使我开了窍。这件事情，对我教育太大了，实在太大了！”
    在生动的事实面前，厂里许多有保守思想的人也有了很大变化。生产计划股长杨培炎原来根本不信能搞出风动工具来。他现在认为“群众的干劲是无法用数字统计出来的”，“如果再不赶上去，就要成为大跃进中的废品了”！从此，他积极改变计划工作中的保守作风，创造了“跟踪调度”的先进方法，还和工人一起劳动和搞技术革新，作出了很多贡献，被评为厂里技术管理干部的标兵。原先不敢参加订货会议的供销股长鞠定均，后来虽然勉强接受了订货，但是一直捏着一把汗，因此工作被动了半年。这回他说：“现在群众说能干到的事情，我就坚决支持，就是大家要我把月亮摘下来，我也一定要想办法上天去！”事实果然如此，下半年的供应工作搞得非常出色，保证了生产翻上去，而且大部原材料都是靠自己想办法解决的，因此被评为厂的劳动模范。
    在1959年，这个厂已制造出了四种风动工具：风镐、风铲、凿岩机和捣固机，在质量上已达到了沈阳风动工具厂的水平，成本也接近沈阳的水平。这一年国家计划生产风动工具六百台，实际完成了七百二十台，全员劳动生产率提高了70％。因此这一年又得省、市奖旗五十二面，并光荣地出席了全国群英会。
          七棵不老松
    当跨入1960年的时候，党支部又为全厂提出新的更高的奋斗目标，要求今年在不增加人的条件下，生产六千台风动工具，将近去年的十倍。全厂职工还立下雄心大志，选择了拥有全套新型技术装备的沈阳风动工具厂作为学习和追赶对象，计划今年五一节前在风镐的成本和工时定额等几项主要指标上赶上它；三年内在以人数平均产量方面赶上它。
    因此，他们提出了一个豪迈的口号：要用自己的双手建成一座现代化的风动工具厂！为了实现这个口号，他们大造洋设备，最近只用二十四天的时间就造出了一台可作车、镗、磨、铣、钻五种用途的万能机床。这台机床可以自动升降、自动走刀和反正开车，能够加工一吨以上的大件活。连专门制造精密机床的昆明机床厂的工程师参观后，也深有所感地说：“我们厂做这种机床，光设计就得半年时间，你们简直是神仙！”在第一季度中，他们就计划搞这样的洋设备二十四台，把自己进一步武装起来。
    这个厂从1952年建厂以来，八年时间里，没有花国家一文钱投资，而年年为国家上缴利润。当年办厂时，几根破秤杆加起来不过百把元的固定资产，而仅1958年和1959年两年，就上缴利润五十二万元。工厂人员已增加到二百六十多人。在七个老工人的影响下，这个工厂仍八年如一日地保持了艰苦朴素的传统。现在除了工人自己盖的几间简陋的厂房和一间大草棚作礼堂兼饭堂外，其它一如昔日。
    现在，人们总喜欢把七个老工人比喻为“七棵不老松”。不久前，“七棵不老松”已有四棵调到了兄弟厂去担负更重的任务了。杨茂春、陈发、海明镜已分别担任了第二五金厂、文具五金厂和车辆厂的厂长。夏宜之在第二五金厂任工会主席。他们在新的岗位上，每碰到什么困难，总喜欢回“娘家”找支部书记商量；工人有什么思想障碍，就带他们来风动工具厂参观。一参观思想就开了窍，回去后都坚决走风动工具厂的道路，用自己武装自己的办法来建设工厂。于是，铜匠担变成了造锁的工厂，修钢笔摊发展成为五金厂，自行车修理点也搞成了车辆厂。人们说：“风动工具厂的人到哪里，跃进的花就开到哪里！”
    现在，昆明风动工具厂已成为云南许多工厂的学习榜样和鼓舞力量。昆明风动工具厂，就是我们工业战线上的“穷棒子社”，这个厂的支部书记和七个老工人，也是工业战线上的“王国藩”。他们靠着马克思列宁主义的雄心壮志，为我们写下了六亿五千万“穷棒子”办工业的最生动的一个侧面。（附图片）
