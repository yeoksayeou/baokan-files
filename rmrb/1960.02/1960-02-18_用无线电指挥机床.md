    Using Radio to Command Machine Tools
    (Our report) Shanghai Shanglian Electrical Equipment Factory's young worker, Ding Jigen, has successfully trial-produced several sets of radio remote controllers.

    This controller can command seven machine tools to carry out production simultaneously from a distance of about one hundred meters. If one of them malfunctions, it will automatically stop, while the other machines continue to operate as usual. Currently, this controller can only control the starting and stopping of the machines. The factory's staff are studying how to further enable the machines under the control of this controller to be able to reverse and forward, and to adjust automatically. To make the control distance further, it is only necessary to increase the power of the transmitter. If relays are installed on each automatic machine tool, this controller can control even more machines.

    用无线电指挥机床
    本报讯　上海上联电工器材厂青年工人丁纪根试制成功了多台数的无线电远距离操纵器。
    这部操纵器可以在一百米左右的距离，指挥七部机床同时进行生产。如有一台发生故障，它会自动停下来，而其它机器仍照常运转。目前，这部操纵器还只能掌握机器的开动和停止。该厂职工正在研究进一步使在这部操纵器掌握下的机器能倒能顺，能自动调节。要使操纵距离更远，只要增加发讯机的电力就行。如在每部自动机床上装上继电器，这种操纵器还可以掌握更多的机器。
