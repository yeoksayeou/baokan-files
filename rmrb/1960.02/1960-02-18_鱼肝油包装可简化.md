    Fish Liver Oil Packaging Can Be Simplified
    I often take fish liver oil and have noticed that many manufacturers produce fish liver oil with both a sealed cap and an additional dropper with a cap. Based on my experience, the original cap on the fish liver oil bottle is never used and is always thrown away. In fact, a cap with a hole could be added after the cork seal. When using, the dropper can be inserted and tightened, which is just as safe. This would save one cap per bottle of fish liver oil. A small cap may not seem like much, but considering the millions of bottles used daily, it represents a huge amount of wealth.

    鱼肝油包装可简化
    我经常服用鱼肝油，发现很多厂生产的鱼肝油都是除瓶口密封加盖外，还另附一个带口盖的吸管。根据我的使用经验，每个原来盖在鱼肝油瓶口上的盖子从来都没有用过，每次都是白白地丢掉了。其实，包装时在软木密封之后加上一个带孔的盖子就可以了，使用时穿上吸管拧紧，同样很安全。这样一瓶鱼肝油就可节约一个盖子。一个小盖看起来值不了多少钱，但从日用千万瓶来看，也是一笔巨大的财富。
