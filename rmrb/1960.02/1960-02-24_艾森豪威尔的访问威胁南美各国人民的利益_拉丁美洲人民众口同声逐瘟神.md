Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, February 22nd: Luis Corvalán, General Secretary of the Chilean Communist Party, recently told a United Press International reporter: "Eisenhower's visit (to South America) should at least be considered a threat to the interests of the people of our countries," and "The United States' policy towards Latin America has not changed, so we must continue to fight it (the United States)."

Corvalán pointed out: The United States' ugly attitude towards Cuba, and the new economic demands it imposes on our countries through the International Monetary Fund, show that the United States "is still stubbornly imposing its imperialist plans on our heads."

Corvalán said that the purpose of Eisenhower's visit is "to consolidate the United States' position in Latin America, to strengthen the so-called solidarity of this hemisphere—like the solidarity between a jockey and a horse, to strengthen the Organization of American States as a super-governmental organization, and to undermine the sovereignty of our countries." He said, "The United States is trying to keep Latin America out of the changes that are taking place in the world, but such changes are also taking place on our continent, the most prominent manifestation of which is the Cuban Revolution. These changes cannot be stopped and are unavoidable. If the United States does not understand this, it understands nothing."

Corvalán emphasized that if Eisenhower's visit means new investments by the United States, this will only further strengthen the dependence of our countries' economies. He also said: "The idea that President Eisenhower's visit will be conducive to the independent industrialization of our countries is an illusion. The United States has always opposed the development of national industries, and its only desire is to develop its monopoly organizations on the Latin American continent."

Corvalán concluded that Eisenhower's visit will "not be welcomed by the people" and that "the people have nothing to do with this visit."

Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd: Santiago News: The Fourth National Special Congress of the Chilean Communist Youth League, which opened on the 21st, condemned U.S. President Eisenhower's visit to South America.

Manuel Gómez, General Secretary of the League, said in his report to the Congress, "We will greet Eisenhower with the slogan 'Yankee Go Home'." He pointed out, "Eisenhower should never be confused with the American people... Therefore, we must show him our hatred without compromise and make him feel it personally." Gómez also warned Eisenhower not to interfere in Cuba.

Gómez's speech was met with warm applause from the audience.

In his report, Gómez also analyzed the domestic and international situation, emphasized the role of youth in the anti-imperialist struggle, and analyzed the situation of Chilean youth under conditions of economic backwardness.

Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd: Buenos Aires News: The Argentine Socialist Party held an open-air mass rally in Once Square on the evening of the 22nd to oppose Eisenhower's upcoming visit to Argentina.

At the rally, Abel Latendorfer, a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party, and other speakers delivered speeches unanimously condemning Eisenhower's visit to Argentina.

Latendorfer said: We Argentine Socialists have taken the podium to firmly state: "The U.S. ruler represents a country that owns colonies and practices imperialist oppression against the people south of the Rio Bravo."

He said that the Argentine Socialist Party "opposes this visit, opposes the purpose of the visit."

The rally was held under the slogan "Yankee Go Home." Angry masses burned three American flags.

Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd: Rio de Janeiro News: "Ultima Hora" published an editorial on the 22nd regarding Eisenhower's visit to Brazil, demanding a change in the economic, political, and military relations between the United States and Brazil. The editorial pointed out that Eisenhower is the representative of the five hundred largest financial groups in North America, whose interests not only "run counter to the most legitimate interests of various countries in striving for liberation and progress" but also "often run counter to the sentiments of the North American people."

The editorial said that the military agreement between Brazil and the United States is outdated, and in economic terms, "we are unwilling and should not continue to serve as a reserve market for U.S. surplus agricultural products, a stack of outdated machines, and a good customer of U.S. banks."

A recent issue of the Brazilian "Weekly" published a commentary stating that the U.S. monopoly capital groups are sending Eisenhower to Latin America at a time when he can no longer do anything for them. The commentary pointed out that Eisenhower, who is controlled by monopoly groups, "will only be able to speak for U.S. monopoly capital. In this case, the talks will not be fruitful."

The magazine said, "The root cause of the misfortune of underdeveloped countries is precisely colonialism, pursuing an open-door policy towards greedy monopoly capital groups, and the policies of the International Monetary Fund implemented in Central America, Peru, Argentina, Portugal, and Spain." The commentary pointed out that during Eisenhower's administration, the Brazilian people have suffered from the actions taken by monopoly capital groups. The military agreement between Brazil and the United States should be abolished; restrictions on Brazil's foreign trade should be lifted; and stable prices should be ensured for Brazil's export products.

    艾森豪威尔的访问威胁南美各国人民的利益
    拉丁美洲人民众口同声逐瘟神
    新华社圣地亚哥22日电　智利共产党总书记路易斯·科尔巴兰最近向合众国际社记者发表谈话说：“艾森豪威尔（对南美）的访问，至少应该被认为是对我们各国人民利益的威胁”，“美国对拉丁美洲的政策没有变，因此我们要继续同它（美国）进行斗争”。
    科尔巴兰指出：美国对古巴的丑恶态度，它通过国际货币基金组织强加在我们这些国家的新的经济要求，说明美国“仍然顽固地把它的帝国主义计划强加在我们的头上”。
    科尔巴兰说，艾森豪威尔这次访问的目的，“在于巩固美国在拉丁美洲的地位，加强所谓的本半球的团结——如同骑师和马之间的团结，加强作为超政府机构的美洲国家组织，破坏我们各国的主权”。他说，“美国企图把拉丁美洲置于世界上正在发生的变化之外，但是，在我们的大陆上也正在发生着这样的变化，其最突出的表现就是古巴革命，这些变化是制止不住，也是无法避免的。假如美国不懂得这一点的话，就是什么也不懂。”
    科尔巴兰强调指出，假如艾森豪威尔的访问能意味着美国进行新的投资的话，这只不过更加加强我们各国经济的附属性。他还说：“认为艾森豪威尔总统的访问会有利于我们这些国家独立的工业化的想法是一种幻想，美国过去和现在都是反对民族工业的发展的，它的唯一愿望就是在拉丁美洲大陆上发展它的垄断组织。”
    科尔巴兰最后说，艾森豪威尔的这次访问将“得不到人民的欢迎”，“人民与这次访问毫无关系”。
    新华社23日讯　圣地亚哥消息：21日开幕的智利共产主义青年联盟第四次全国特别代表大会谴责美国总统艾森豪威尔访问南美。
    联盟的总书记曼努埃尔·戈麦斯在会上作报告时说，“我们要用‘美国佬滚回去’的标语来迎接艾森豪威尔”。他指出，“艾森豪威尔同美国人民绝不能混为一谈……因此，我们要毫不妥协地对他表明我们的憎恨，并使他亲身感受到这一点”。戈麦斯并且警告艾森豪威尔不要干涉古巴。
    戈麦斯的讲话引起了全场热烈的掌声。
    戈麦斯在报告中还分析了国内和国际形势，强调指出青年在反帝斗争中的作用，并且分析了在经济落后的条件下智利青年所处的境遇。
    新华社23日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：阿根廷社会党22日晚在翁塞广场举行露天群众大会，反对艾森豪威尔即将对阿根廷进行的访问。
    在大会上，社会党中央执行委员会委员阿维尔·拉滕多尔弗和其他发言人发表演说，一致谴责艾森豪威尔前往阿根廷访问。
    拉滕多尔弗说：我们阿根廷社会党人登上讲坛，是为了坚决表明：“美国执政者代表一个拥有殖民地并对布拉沃河以南的人民实行帝国主义压迫的国家。”
    他说，阿根廷社会党“反对这次访问，反对访问的目的”。
    大会是在“美国佬滚蛋”的口号下举行的。愤怒的群众烧毁了三面美国国旗。
    新华社23日讯　里约热内卢消息：“最后一点钟报”22日就艾森豪威尔访问巴西之行发表社论，要求改变美国同巴西之间的经济、政治和军事关系。社论指出，艾森豪威尔是北美五百个大财团的代表，这些财团的利益不仅“同各国争取解放和进步的最正当的利益背道而驰”，而且“也往往同北美人民的情绪背道而驰”。
    社论说，巴西同美国之间的军事协定已经过时，在经济方面，“我们不愿意也不应该继续充当美国剩余农产品的后备市场和充当过时的机器的堆栈，以及继续充当美国银行的好主顾。”
    最近一期的巴西“周刊”发表评论说，美国垄断资本集团是在艾森豪威尔不能再对拉丁美洲有所作为的时候让他到拉丁美洲来访问的。评论指出，受垄断集团控制的艾森豪威尔“将只能代表美国垄断资本说话。在这种情况下，会谈是不会有结果的。”
    这家杂志说，“不发达国家的不幸的根源正是殖民主义，是向贪得无餍的垄断资本集团奉行门户开放政策，是在中美、秘鲁、阿根廷、葡萄牙和西班牙实行的国际货币基金组织的政策。”评论指出，在艾森豪威尔政府执政期间，巴西人民身受到垄断资本集团所采取的行动的苦楚。应该废除巴西同美国之间的军事协定；取消强加于巴西的对外贸易的限制；使巴西出口产品享有稳定的价格。
