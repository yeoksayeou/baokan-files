Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 19th. The ships "Mei Shang Mei" and "Fu An," sent by the Chinese government to transport overseas Chinese returning to the country, today carried more than 1,020 overseas Chinese who had been displaced in the anti-Chinese activities in West Java, leaving Tanjung Priok Port to return to the country. More than 600 of these returning overseas Chinese boarded the ship today.

Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia Huang Zhen and his wife, Counselor Liu Yufeng, Cultural Counselor Sima Wensen, Commercial Counselor Liu Jinsheng, Counselor and Consul General Li Jusheng, Military Attaché Colonel Mao Chen and their wives, Wu Zhizhi, the Chinese representative to the Joint Committee of China and Indonesia for the implementation of the dual nationality treaty, and staff members of the Chinese Embassy and Consulate General braved the rain to see off the returning overseas Chinese at the dock.

Representatives of the overseas Chinese in Indonesia visited the returning overseas Chinese boarding the two ships again before they set sail, bid them farewell, and saw them off at the dock.

The overseas Chinese who had been concentrated in Jakarta from West Java were obstructed when they boarded the Tanjung Priok Port on the 17th. On the 18th, the first group of more than 400 overseas Chinese were allowed to board the "Mei Shang Mei" ship. After boarding the ships sent by the motherland to pick them up, these overseas Chinese were warmly received by the personnel sent by the Chinese government to pick them up. In the past few days, the crew members had cleaned the cabins and prepared dishes, food, and tea every day, ready to receive these persecuted compatriots at any time. After these compatriots boarded the ship one after another, they immediately received food and tea.

These overseas Chinese, who had suffered greatly in the anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia, were filled with indescribable joy at returning to the warm embrace of the motherland when they set off to return to the country. They leaned on the railings of the deck and shouted: "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Long Live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long Live the Friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian People!" They also sang songs such as "Ode to the Motherland," "Unity is Strength," and "Socialism is Good."

Those who saw off the returning overseas Chinese at the dock wished them "bon voyage." The cheers and applause from the ship and the shore merged into a loud noise.

    黄镇大使等冒雨到码头欢送，侨胞高呼毛主席万岁中国共产党万岁
    新华社雅加达19日电　中国政府派来接运华侨归国的轮船“美上美号”和“福安号”今天载运了一千零二十多名在西爪哇排华活动中流离失所的华侨，离开丹绒不碌港回国。在这批启程回国的华侨中，有六百多人是在今天上船的。
    中国驻印度尼西亚大使黄镇和他的夫人，中国大使馆参赞柳雨峰、文化参赞司马文森、商务参赞刘金生、参赞兼总领事李菊生、武官茅琛上校以及他们的夫人，为实施双重国籍问题条约的中国—印度尼西亚联合委员会的中国代表伍治之，中国大使馆和总领事馆的人员都冒雨在码头上欢送这批归国华侨。
    在印度尼西亚的华侨代表在这两条轮船启碇前，再次访问了登船的归国华侨，同他们道别，并且在码头上欢送他们。
    这批从西爪哇集中到雅加达的华侨在17日到丹绒不碌港上船时，曾经遭到阻挠。18日，第一批华侨四百多人才被允许登上“美上美号”轮船。这些华侨在登上祖国派来接他们回国的轮船以后，受到中国政府派去接他们回国的人员的热情接待。在过去几天中，船上人员曾经把房舱打扫得干干净净，每天准备了菜肴、食物和茶水，准备随时接待这些受迫害的侨胞。这些侨胞陆续登船以后，立即得到食物和茶水供应。
    这些在印度尼西亚的排华活动中饱受苦难的华侨在启程回国的时候，充满了回返祖国温暖怀抱的不可言喻的喜悦。他们靠在甲板的栏杆旁高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”“中国—印度尼西亚人民友好万岁！”他们还高唱“歌唱祖国”、“团结就是力量”和“社会主义好”等歌曲。
    在码头上为这批归侨送行的人祝他们“一路平安”。船上和岸上的欢呼声和掌声汇成巨响。
