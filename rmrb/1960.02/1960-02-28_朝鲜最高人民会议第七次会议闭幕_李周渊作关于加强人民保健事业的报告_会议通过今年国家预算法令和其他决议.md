The report first discussed the great achievements made in health care over the fifteen years since the liberation of northern Korea.

In 1959, the number of doctors reached 3.7 times that of 1944 before liberation, the number of hospital beds reached 25 times, and the number of clinics and medical institutions has increased to 3.2 times that of 1944.

The report stated that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has established a public medical system and is developing the current free medical system into a comprehensive free medical system.

The report said that due to the mass health and cultural movement, great achievements have been made in popularizing health knowledge and improving environmental hygiene. Northern Korea has completely eliminated infectious diseases such as smallpox, relapsing fever, and cholera, and has basically eliminated typhoid fever.

When discussing the tasks of strengthening public health in the future, the report said that in order to implement the policy of prevention first, it is necessary to further vigorously carry out the health and cultural movement and vigorously improve the labor and living environment of the people. In the coming years, the health knowledge level of all working people should reach the level of middle school graduates.

The report stated that in the coming years, the number of doctors and hospital beds should be increased to four times and two times that of 1959 respectively. Within this year, every ri (village) in rural areas should have a clinic, and county hospitals should be equipped with various specialists. In a short period of time, all births should be attended by modern midwifery methods. The report also emphasized the need to inherit and develop traditional Korean medicine, which has a long history in Korea. In a short period of time, expand the ranks of traditional Korean medicine doctors, ensure the supply of traditional Korean medicines, and implement a free medical system for traditional Korean medicine. The report finally emphasized the need to strengthen communist education among medical personnel and cultivate medical workers into red medical soldiers of the Party who are loyal to the people's health and have a lofty communist style.

    据新华社平壤26日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁副首相李周渊今天上午在朝鲜第二届最高人民会议第七次会议上作了关于加强人民保健事业的报告。
    报告首先谈到了朝鲜北部解放后十五年来卫生保健事业取得的巨大成就。报告说，朝鲜政府一贯大力发展人民保健事业，今年国家预算中的保健费为一亿二千万元，这等于1956年的五倍多。在1959年，医生人数达到解放前1944年的三点七倍，医院病床数达到二十五倍，诊疗机构数已经增加到1944年的三点二倍。
    报告说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国已经确立了人民医疗制度，并且正在把实行中的免费医疗制度发展成为全面的免费医疗制。
    报告说，由于展开了群众性的卫生文化运动，在普及卫生知识、改善环境卫生方面取得了巨大的成就。朝鲜北部已经完全消灭了天花、回归热、霍乱等传染病，基本上消灭了伤寒。
    报告在谈到今后加强人民保健事业的任务时说，为了贯彻事先预防的方针，要进一步大力展开卫生文化运动，大力改善人民劳动和生活的环境。在近年内要使全体劳动人民的卫生知识水平达到中学毕业生的程度。
    报告说，在近年内，要使医生数和病床数分别增加到1959年的四倍和二倍，在今年以内就要使农村中每个里（即乡）都有诊疗所，在郡（即县）的医院中配备各种专科医生。在短期间内使所有的产妇都用新法接生。报告还强调，要继承和发展在朝鲜有悠久传统的汉医学。在短时期内扩大汉医的队伍，保证汉药的供应，实行汉医的免费医疗制。报告最后强调，要在医务人员中加强共产主义教育，把医务工作者培养成为忠实于人民保健事业、具有崇高的共产主义风格的党的红色医务战士。
