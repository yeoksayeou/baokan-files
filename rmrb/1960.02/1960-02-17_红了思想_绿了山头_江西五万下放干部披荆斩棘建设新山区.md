Jiangxi's 50,000 Downward-Transferred Cadres Break Ground to Build New Mountainous Areas

(Our dispatch) Our reporter Zhao Yong'an reports: Over the past two years, the state-run comprehensive reclamation farms in Jiangxi Province, with over 50,000 downward-transferred cadres as their backbone, have achieved great success.

The state-run comprehensive reclamation farms in Jiangxi Province were established in the winter of 1957 by downward-transferred cadres and officers. They have now grown from the original 105 farms to 209, with a total of over 1.15 million employees. They are engaged in diverse economies such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fishery, and mountainous industries. The cultivated land area managed by the reclamation farms reaches over 2.8 million mu, and the forest area reaches over 36 million mu. At the same time, based on the principle of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, they have extensively developed and utilized mountain resources, establishing over 2,200 factories operating 300 projects, including timber processing, wood fiber, forest chemical industry, mineral mining, mechanical industry, and comprehensive utilization of wild plants. According to preliminary statistics, the total value of industrial and agricultural production in 1959 reached 520 million yuan, an increase of 69.1% compared to 1958, of which the industrial output value reached 144.4 million yuan, an increase of 193.3% compared to 1958.

The reclamation farms can also produce a large quantity of commodities for the state. According to incomplete statistics, in 1959, the state-run reclamation farms delivered 300 million jin of commercial grain to the state, accounting for 25.58% of their total grain output; delivered 158,300 live pigs, accounting for 25.95% of the total number of live pigs raised throughout the year; and transferred upwards 59% of the province's commercial timber and 58% of thatch bamboo. Throughout the year, the commodities purchased by the state from reclamation farms accounted for 31.24% of the total amount of currency purchased and put into circulation in the province.

Over the past two years, the reclamation farms have also received many new technical equipment. Many reclamation farms have established mechanized farming teams and motor transport teams, modern machinery factories and repair shops, thermal or hydroelectric power stations, and have also built more than 7,000 kilometers of mountain roads and various transport slides, greatly increasing labor productivity. The changes in the mountainous areas have attracted the broad masses of farmers. Since the summer and autumn of 1958, the broad masses of farmers have been clamoring to join the reclamation farms. According to provincial statistics, the number of farmers who have joined the reclamation farms has reached 950,000.

Over the past two years, downward-transferred cadres and officers have made great contributions to the construction of mountainous areas by breaking ground and starting from scratch to establish reclamation farms in the vast mountainous areas. There has been enormous development in all sectors, including industry, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, road transport, and cultural education. Some previously sparsely populated mountainous areas have now been built into thriving new socialist mountainous areas. The downward-transferred cadres and people in Jinggangshan have issued such heroic words: We must build Jinggangshan into the number one mountain in the world! The old revolutionary base areas of Da Mao Mountain, Wuyi Mountain, Jiulian Mountain, and Deshengguan have also been built with great vigor over the past two years, becoming important production bases in the province.

Downward-transferred cadres have not only changed the face of the mountainous areas through their hard work, but also their ideological outlook has undergone great changes in labor training, their communist qualities are growing, and their production knowledge and labor skills have been greatly improved. More than 70% of them have become management cadres and leaders in various departments of the reclamation farms. For intellectual youths who were "unable to distinguish the five grains," after two years of labor training in the mountains, they not only deeply experienced the joys and hardships of labor, but also mastered rich production experience, and many have become production experts or advanced producers. According to statistics from only 15 farms such as Maoshan Tou, there are 2,939 advanced producers, and many people have also participated in scientific research. According to statistics from nine farms such as Da Mao Mountain, there are 983 people, researching 472 projects. They love labor and also love the mountainous areas. Many people have moved their families to the mountains, preparing to settle down in the mountains for a long time. The comrades of the Jinggangshan reclamation farm said: "Be red in Jinggangshan, specialize in Jinggangshan, and build Jinggangshan for a lifetime."

    红了思想　绿了山头
    江西五万下放干部披荆斩棘建设新山区
    本报讯　记者赵永安报道：江西省以五万多名下放干部为骨干的国营综合垦殖场，两年来已经取得巨大成就。
    江西省的各国营综合垦殖场是1957年冬天，由下放干部和下放军官建立起来的。现在已由原来的一百零五个场发展成为二百零九个场，全部职工达一百一十五万多人，经营着农、林、牧、副、渔、山区工业等多种经济；各垦殖场经营的耕地面积达二百八十多万亩，山林面积达三千六百多万亩。同时，根据工农业同时并举的方针，广泛地开发和利用山区资源，建立了经营木材加工、木材纤维、林产化工、矿产采掘、机械工业和野生植物综合利用等三百个项目的二千二百多个工厂。据初步统计，1959年的工农业生产总值达五亿二千万元，比1958年增长69．1％，其中工业产值达一亿四千四百万元，比1958年增加193．3％。
    各垦殖场还能为国家大量生产商品。据不完全统计，1959年各国营垦殖场向国家交售的商品粮为三亿斤，占它们粮食总产量的25．58％；交售生猪十五万八千三百头，占全年生猪饲养总头数的25．95％；上调木材占全省商品木材的59％，茅竹占58％。全年国家向垦殖场和农场收购的商品占全省收购投放货币总额的31．24％。
    两年来，垦殖场还得到了许多新的技术装备，很多垦殖场建立了机耕队、汽车运输队，建立了现代化的机械厂和修配厂，建立了火力或水力发电站，还修建了七千多公里的山区公路和各种运输滑道，劳动生产率大大提高。山区面貌的变化，吸引了广大农民，1958年夏秋以来，广大农民纷纷要求加入垦殖场。据全省统计，目前已经加入垦殖场的农民达九十五万人。
    两年来，下放干部、下放军官在广大山区，披荆斩棘、白手起家建立垦殖场，对山区建设作出了巨大的贡献。工农林牧等各业生产、公路交通、文化教育事业，都有了巨大的发展。过去一些人烟稀少的山区，现在已建设成为欣欣向荣的社会主义新山区。在井冈山的下放干部和人民发出了这样的豪言壮语：一定要把井冈山建成天下第一山！大茅山、武夷山、九连山、德胜关等老根据地，两年来也都建设得气象万千，成了全省的重要的生产基地。
    下放干部不仅通过辛勤的劳动改变了山区面貌，同时在劳动锻炼中，他们的思想面貌有了很大的改变，共产主义素质正在增长，生产知识和劳动技能大大提高。他们之中的70％以上的人都已经成了垦殖场各个部门的管理干部和领导者。对于“五谷不分”的知识青年来说，经过两年在山上劳动锻炼，不仅深深地体会到劳动的甘苦，同时掌握了丰富的生产经验，而且不少人成了生产能手或先进生产者。仅据茅山头等十五个场统计，先进生产者达二千九百三十九名，不少的人还参加科学研究工作。据大茅山等九个场统计，即有九百八十三人，研究的项目达四百七十二项。他们热爱劳动，也热爱山区。不少的人把家搬上了山，准备在山上长期安家落户。井冈山垦殖场的同志们表示：“红在井冈山，专在井冈山，一辈子建设井冈山。”
