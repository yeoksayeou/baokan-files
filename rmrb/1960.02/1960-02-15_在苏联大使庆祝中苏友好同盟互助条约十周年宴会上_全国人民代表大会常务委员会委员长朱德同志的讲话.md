Comrade Ambassador, Dear Comrade Yelyutin, Head of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association Delegation, and all comrades of the delegation, comrades, and friends:

Today, we are attending the Ambassador's banquet and joining everyone in celebrating the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Aid. I am extremely excited. Please allow me, on behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people, to once again extend the warmest congratulations to the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people.

Since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, over the past ten years, the relations of mutual assistance and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in various fields such as politics, economy, culture, science, and technology have been comprehensively developed. Our two countries have supported each other and cooperated closely in the struggle to defend peace. The leaders of our two parties and countries have continuously conducted friendly visits. In particular, Comrade Mao Zedong visited Moscow twice in 1950 and 1957, and Comrade Khrushchev visited Beijing three times in 1954, 1958, and 1959, which greatly consolidated and strengthened the unity of the great people of our two countries.

Over the past ten years, the close cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in economy and technology has powerfully promoted the common upsurge of the economic construction undertakings of our two countries. The trade volume between China and the Soviet Union has continued to grow. In recent years, China's trade volume with the Soviet Union has accounted for about 50% of China's total foreign trade volume, and the Soviet Union's trade volume with China also occupies an important position in the Soviet Union's total foreign trade volume. The Soviet Union has helped China build and is building more than 290 large-scale construction projects, which are the core and backbone of China's industrial construction and play a significant role in China's rapid completion of a complete industrial system. The Soviet Union has sent many experienced experts to help China with construction and has also helped China train a large number of scientific and technical personnel. The Soviet Union helped China formulate a twelve-year science development plan and gave us significant assistance in the research of peaceful uses of atomic energy, which greatly promoted China's scientific and technological research work. Here, on behalf of our Party, government, and people, I would like to once again express my heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet Party, government, and people for the great assistance they have given us.

Ten years is but a moment in human history. But the past ten years have been extraordinary, full of great and profound changes. Our common cause has undergone unprecedented development, and the enemies of peace and socialism have reached the end of their rope. This is a great victory for Marxism-Leninism. The Moscow Conference of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties held in 1957 and the declaration it adopted have great historical significance for strengthening our unity and promoting our common cause. We must continue to develop our victory on this basis, along the common path of the October Revolution, and advance the struggle of the people of the world for peace and socialism to a higher stage. We believe that in the years to come, the great Sino-Soviet alliance will surely be able to play its immeasurable role in the noble cause of defending world peace and striving for human progress. In order to win the victory of our common cause, we must spare no effort to strengthen the great unity between China and the Soviet Union, strengthen the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and on this basis, strengthen the unity with all peace-loving people and countries in the world.

Dear comrades and friends!

Please allow me to propose:

    For the great Sino-Soviet alliance,
    For the close cooperation between China and the Soviet Union,
    For the unbreakable friendship between the fraternal Chinese and Soviet peoples,
    For the strong unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union,
    For the great Soviet people,
    For the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union headed by Comrade Khrushchev,
    For the victory of world peace, cheers!

    在苏联大使庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约十周年宴会上
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长朱德同志的讲话亲爱的大使同志，苏中友好协会代表团团长叶留金同志和全体团员同志们，同志们，朋友们：
    今天，我们出席大使同志的宴会，和大家一起来庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订十周年，感到无限兴奋。请允许我代表中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民，再一次向伟大的苏联共产党、苏联政府和苏联人民表示最热烈的祝贺。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约签订以后，十年来，中苏两国在政治、经济、文化、科学技术等各方面的互助合作关系得到了全面的发展。我们两国在保卫和平的斗争中互相支持、密切合作。我们两国党和国家领导人不断地进行了友好访问，特别是毛泽东同志在1950年和1957年两次访问了莫斯科，赫鲁晓夫同志在1954年、1958年和1959年三次访问了北京，极大地巩固和加强了我们两国伟大人民的团结。
    十年来，中苏两国在经济和技术方面的紧密合作，有力地促进了我们两国经济建设事业的共同高涨。中苏两国贸易额不断增长。几年来我国对苏联的贸易额，占我国对外贸易总额的50％左右，苏联对我国的贸易额在苏联对外贸易总额中也占重要的地位。苏联帮助我国已经建成和正在建设的二百九十多个规模巨大的建设项目，是我国工业建设的核心和骨干，对我国迅速建成完整的工业体系有着重大的作用。苏联派遣了很多经验丰富的专家前来帮助我国建设，并且帮助我国培养了大批的科学技术人材。苏联帮助我国制订了十二年科学发展规划，并且在和平利用原子能的研究方面给了我们重大的帮助，大大促进了我国的科学技术研究工作。在这里，我代表我们的党、政府和人民，对苏联党、政府和人民给予我们的巨大援助，再一次表示衷心的感谢。
    十年不过是人类历史的一瞬。但是过去的十年却是不平常的、充满着伟大和深刻变化的十年。我们的共同事业有了空前的发展，和平和社会主义的敌人已经走上了穷途末路。这是马克思列宁主义的伟大胜利。1957年在莫斯科召开的各国共产党和工人党代表会议及其所通过的宣言，对于加强我们的团结和促进我们的共同事业有着重大的历史意义。我们一定要在这个基础上，沿着十月革命的共同道路继续发展我们的胜利，把全世界人民争取和平和社会主义的斗争推进到一个更高的阶段。我们相信，在未来的岁月中，伟大的中苏同盟一定能够在保卫世界和平和争取人类进步的崇高事业中更加发挥它的不可估量的作用。为了争取我们共同事业的胜利，我们必须不遗余力地加强中苏两国的伟大团结，加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结，并且在这个基础上加强同全世界一切爱好和平的人民和国家的团结。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们！
    请允许我提议：
    为伟大的中苏同盟，
    为中苏两国的亲密合作，
    为兄弟的中苏人民牢不可破的友谊，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的坚强团结，
    为伟大的苏联人民，
    为光荣的苏联共产党和以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联共产党中央委员会，
    为世界和平的胜利，干杯！
