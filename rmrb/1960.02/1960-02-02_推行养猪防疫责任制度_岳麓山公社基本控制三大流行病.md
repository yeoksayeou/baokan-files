Promoting a Hog Raising Epidemic Prevention Responsibility System
Yue麓 Mountain Commune Basically Controls Three Major Epidemics

(Reported by this newspaper) The Yue麓 Mountain People's Commune in the suburbs of Changsha City, Hunan Province, has implemented an epidemic prevention responsibility system in its hog raising work, combining routine epidemic prevention work with sudden mass movements. The commune has basically controlled three major epidemic diseases: hog cholera, swine erysipelas, and swine plague. Over half of the commune's pig farms have basically achieved disease-free and mortality-free status. Compared with the situation before the commune implemented the epidemic prevention responsibility system in April last year: the number of pigs in stock has increased by about half, the number of veterinary personnel has decreased by a quarter, medical expenses have decreased by more than half, and the pig mortality rate has dropped significantly. November is the season with the highest number of pig illnesses and deaths each year, but in November 1959, the pig mortality rate was only 0.17%.

The commune has established a unified epidemic prevention committee, and all pigs born in pig farms after twenty days are subject to a responsibility system that includes epidemic prevention in normal times and treatment during illness. This is an effective way to eliminate epidemic diseases quickly, effectively, and economically and to carry out epidemic prevention and hygiene work.

Yue麓 Mountain Commune is one of Changsha City's commodity pig production bases. In April 1959, based on the characteristics of increased collective pig raising and greater threats of epidemic diseases after communization, the commune party committee carefully summarized and developed past experience in epidemic prevention work, implementing a responsibility system for veterinarians that included fixed tasks, fixed drug costs, and fixed numbers of pig deaths, which played a significant role in ensuring the great development of pig raising.

Their specific methods are: The commune, led by the party committee secretary in charge of animal husbandry, and inviting representatives from veterinarians, epidemic prevention personnel, and feeders, established an "Epidemic Prevention Committee." Each brigade has established a branch. The Epidemic Prevention Committee or its branches implement a responsibility system for all pigs born in breeding farms at all levels after twenty days, including epidemic prevention and treatment. After committees at all levels contract for prevention and treatment work, while conducting regular political and ideological education for veterinary epidemic prevention personnel, they also implement a zoned and contracted reward and punishment work responsibility system based on different conditions such as pig distribution, epidemic prevalence, and veterinary technology. The content of the reward and punishment system is: First, a fixed task for epidemic prevention and treatment, with rewards for exceeding the quota; second, fixed drug and equipment costs, with bonuses for savings; third, fixed reduction in pig illness and death, with a certain amount of cash reward for each pig that dies less; conversely, appropriate action will be taken based on the specific situation. In this way, political and ideological education is better combined with material interests, and everyone's enthusiasm is very high.

The Yue麓 Commune Party Committee summarized that the implementation of the epidemic prevention responsibility system has the following benefits: First, the enthusiasm of the feeders for raising pigs has greatly increased. Last spring, when the commune's pig farms implemented the contract production method of calculating work points based on output value and cost, the feeders were worried about pig deaths and dared not contract for production. After the implementation of the epidemic prevention responsibility system in April, the contract production method was quickly and universally promoted in more than 1,400 collective pig farms, powerfully promoting the high-speed development of the pig raising industry. Second, it further mobilized the enthusiasm of veterinarians. After implementing the work responsibility system for veterinarians, everyone used their brains to find methods, find local medicines and remedies, and actively help feeders improve feeding management methods to prevent the spread of various diseases. Last year, the commune's thirty-plus veterinarians trained more than six hundred feeders, who basically learned epidemic prevention knowledge such as finding local medicines, giving vaccinations, and measuring temperatures, becoming powerful assistants to the veterinarians.

Third, it is easy to carry out prevention work and prevent the spread of epidemic diseases. In the past, when carrying out vaccination work, the masses were worried that vaccinations would kill pigs. After the implementation of the epidemic prevention responsibility system, feeders actively requested vaccinations. In 1959, the commune carried out more than 110,000 vaccinations for swine erysipelas, swine plague, and hog cholera, ensuring the smooth completion of the commune's eradication of the three types of epidemic diseases in pigs.

Fourth, it is beneficial to concentrate the small and scattered medical expenses and focus them on areas with more serious epidemics, giving full play to the treatment effect and effectively controlling the spread of epidemics.

    推行养猪防疫责任制度
    岳麓山公社基本控制三大流行病
    本报讯　湖南长沙市郊区岳麓山人民公社在养猪工作中推行了防疫责任制，使经常性的防疫工作和突击性的群众运动结合起来，全社已基本上控制了猪瘟、猪丹毒、猪肺疫等三大流行性疫病。全社约有半数以上的猪场基本上实现无疾病、无死亡。和去年4月全社实行防疫责任制以前的情况比较：存栏猪约增加一半，兽医人员减少四分之一，医药费减少一半多，猪死亡率下降很多。每年11月是猪生病死亡最多的季节，但1959年11月猪的死亡率只有0．17％。
    这个公社成立了统一的防疫委员会，对猪场出生二十天后的猪，一律实行平时包防疫、病时包治疗等责任制度。这是多快好省地消灭流行性疾病，开展防疫卫生工作的有效办法。
    岳麓山公社是长沙市商品猪生产基地之一。1959年4月间，公社党委会根据公社化后集体养猪多、流行性疾病威胁较大的特点，认真总结和发展了过去的防疫工作经验，对兽医实行定任务、定药费、定少死猪等责任制度，对保证猪的大发展起了很大作用。
    他们的具体做法是：公社以专管畜牧的党委书记为首，并邀请兽医、防疫人员、饲养员等方面的代表参加，成立“防疫委员会”。每个大队都成立分会。由防疫委员会或其分会对全社各级饲养场出生二十天后的生猪，全部实行包防疫、包治疗等责任制。各级委员会承包防治工作后，在对兽医防疫人员进行经常性的政治思想教育的同时，又根据猪的分布、疫情的流行、兽医的技术等不同条件，实行划片包干的奖惩工作责任制。奖惩制的内容是：一定防疫治疗的任务，超额有奖；二定药费药械，节余提奖；三定猪少生病少死亡，每少死一头猪给予一定的现金奖励；反之，根据具体情况酌情处理。这样，把政治思想教育与物质利益更好地结合起来，大家积极性都很高。
    岳麓公社党委总结推行防疫责任制有以下几种好处：首先，饲养员养猪积极性大大提高。去春，全社猪场推行按产值计工分、计成本的包产办法时，饲养员都担心死猪，不敢包产。4月间实行防疫责任制后，包产办法就很快在一千四百多个集体养猪场中普遍推行了，有力地促进了养猪事业的高速度发展。其次，进一步调动了兽医的积极性。对兽医实行工作责任制后，大家都开动脑筋想办法，找土药土方，积极主动地帮助饲养员改进饲养管理方法，预防各种疾病流行。去年全社三十多名兽医分别训练了六百多名饲养员，基本上学会了找土药、打防疫针、测温度等防疫知识，成为兽医的有力助手。
    第三，便于开展预防工作，防止流行性的病疫。过去开展防疫注射工作，群众担心打针会死猪。实行防疫责任制后，饲养员都主动要求进行防疫注射。1959年全社进行猪丹毒、猪肺疫、猪瘟的预防注射有十一万多头次，保证了全社顺利完成扑灭猪的三种流行性疾病。
    第四，有利于把少量、分散的医药费用，集中起来重点使用在疫情比较严重的地区，充分发挥治疗效果，有效控制病疫的流行。
