To Promote National Economic and Production Level Improvement
Czechoslovakia Vigorously Expands Raw Material Base

    (Reported by this newspaper) Currently, the Czechoslovak people are concerned with the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965). During the Third Five-Year Plan, Czechoslovakia's national economy will be greatly improved, and the industrial production level will increase by at least 50% compared to the Second Five-Year Plan, and agricultural production will increase by more than 21%. To complete such a major national economic task, it is necessary to greatly expand the raw material base.

    Compared with 1937, the mining of bituminous coal in 1958 increased from about 16.7 million tons to 26 million tons, and lignite increased from 17.5 million tons to 54.6 million tons. Czechoslovakia ranks first in the world in coal mining per capita. During the same period, iron ore mining increased from 1.8 million tons to 2.8 million tons. The mining of other types of raw materials has also increased. But all of this is not enough. Czechoslovakia's highly developed processing industry requires much larger quantities of domestically produced raw materials, as well as raw materials that Czechoslovakia does not have at all, or whose quantities are very insufficient, such as non-ferrous metals and petroleum.

    Therefore, Czechoslovakia is stepping up geological exploration work, paying great attention to improving and processing raw materials, and increasing the import volume of raw materials from other socialist countries.

    In the past few years, geological exploration work has achieved noteworthy results. For example, tens of millions of tons of bituminous coal reserves were discovered near Ostrava, and lignite reserves were discovered in the Krušné Mountains. Exploration work has expanded the domestic raw material base for pyrite. Many new non-ferrous metal deposits have been discovered, especially new deposits of fluorides in the Jeseníky Mountains. The identified reserves of refractory materials are among the largest in Europe.

    Good results have also been achieved in improving and processing certain raw materials. For example, domestic lean iron ore is improved by roasting. The construction of a factory in Handlová, Slovakia, to produce pulp from beech wood is of great significance.

    In expanding the raw material base, socialist countries have given Czechoslovakia extremely important assistance. In 1958 alone, 3.7 million tons of iron ore, 1 million tons of bituminous coal, 5,000 railcars of non-ferrous metals, etc., were imported from the Soviet Union.

    During the Third Five-Year Plan, geological exploration work will explore at least 50 million tons of new reserves of medium iron content iron ore, no less than 8 million tons of new reserves of copper ore, no less than 3.6 million tons of lead and zinc ore, and so on.

    Czechoslovakia will cooperate with other socialist countries to ensure the raw materials it needs, primarily obtaining large quantities of iron ore and petroleum from the Soviet Union. At the same time, Czechoslovakia will provide machinery and equipment in the form of credit to help Albania, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and other countries develop their raw material bases. And these countries are providing or will provide Czechoslovakia with various raw materials: Albania provides nickel and chromium, Poland provides sulfur, Hungary provides aluminum, Bulgaria provides copper, Romania provides pulp, and so on.

    促进国民经济和生产水平的提高
    捷大力扩大原料基地
    本报讯　目前，捷克斯洛伐克人民都在关心着第三个五年计划（1961—1965年）。在第三个五年计划期间，捷克斯洛伐克的国民经济将大大提高，工业生产水平将比第二个五年计划至少提高50％，农业生产将提高21％以上。为了完成这样重大的国民经济任务，要求大大扩大原料基地。
    与1937年比较，1958年石煤的开采差不多从一千六百七十万吨增加到了二千六百万吨、褐煤从一千七百五十万吨增加到了五千四百六十万吨。按人口平均计算，捷克斯洛伐克在煤的开采方面占世界第一位。在同一时期内，铁矿石的开采从一百八十万吨增加到了二百八十万吨。其他种类原料的开采也提高了。但这一切还是不够的。捷克斯洛伐克高度发达的加工工业需要数量大得多的国产原料以及捷克斯洛伐克根本没有、或者数量很不够的原料如有色金属、石油等。
    因此，捷克斯洛伐克正在加紧进行地质勘探工作，非常注意改良和加工原料的工作，并提高其他社会主义国家原料的进口量。
    还在过去几年中，地质勘探工作就已获得了值得注意的成绩。比如，在俄斯特拉发附近发现了数以几千万吨计的石煤储藏、在克鲁史纳山发现了褐煤的储藏。勘探工作扩大了黄铁矿的国产原料基地。有色金属的新储藏地已发现了很多，特别是在叶谢尼克山中发现了氟化物的新储藏地。已查明的耐火原料的储藏是欧洲最大的之一。
    在改良和加工某几种原料的工作方面也取得了很好的成绩。例如，对国产贫铁矿石用焙烧的方法来加以改良。在斯洛伐克的亨卓夫采城建设用山毛榉木生产纸浆的工厂，都具有很重要的意义。
    在扩大原料基地方面，各社会主义国家给了捷克斯洛伐克极其重大的帮助。1958年仅从苏联就输入了三百七十万吨铁矿石、一百万吨石煤、五千车皮有色金属等等。
    在第三个五年计划期间，地质勘探工作将至少要勘探出五千万吨中等含铁量铁矿石的新的储藏，不少于八百万吨铜矿石的新的储藏，不少于三百六十万吨的铅和锌的矿石等等。
    捷克斯洛伐克将和其他社会主义国家合作，以保证它所必需的原料，首先是从苏联获得大量铁矿石和石油。同时捷克斯洛伐克将以信贷形式提供机械设备帮助阿尔巴尼亚、波兰、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚等国原料基地的发展。而这些国家也正在提供或将提供捷克斯洛伐克各种各样的原料：阿尔巴尼亚提供镍和铬、波兰提供硫磺、匈牙利提供铝、保加利亚提供铜、罗马尼亚提供纸浆等等。
