Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd: China's spring enrollment for all levels and types of schools in 1960 is about to begin. Implementing both autumn and spring semesters in all levels and types of schools is a new and important measure. It will have a positive promoting effect on the rapid development of education in our country and the acceleration of technical force training.

The targets for spring enrollment are mainly high school, junior high school, and senior elementary school graduates who have not yet continued their studies or found employment, students with equivalent academic qualifications, and qualified employees, cadres, and demobilized veterans transferred from within enterprises and institutions. School-age children who are not in school should also be enrolled as much as possible, based on the conditions and possibilities of local primary schools. Currently enrolled students and teachers at all levels and types of schools will not be enrolled.

Spring enrollment will be carried out within the scope of each province, city, and autonomous region. The Ministry of Education will form an enrollment organization in conjunction with relevant central departments to uniformly lead this work. Each province, city, and autonomous region will, under the leadership of the local Party committee and People's Committee, form an enrollment organization with relevant departments to specifically handle various enrollment tasks. Schools affiliated with central departments will participate in the unified local enrollment. The spring enrollment work will be completed during the winter vacation or a little later. Various regions and central departments are actively preparing for enrollment.
