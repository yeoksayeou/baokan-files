    Undersea Treasures
    Manganese is one of the most needed metals in modern times. Large amounts of manganese are needed in rocket technology, which contains various alloys. However, manganese resources are limited. It mainly relies on expensive and complex methods to extract it from seawater.
    Scientists have discovered many nodules in certain areas of the seabed. These fist-sized spherical rocks contain 25% manganese, 15% iron, and also contain copper, nickel, and cobalt. Methods for mining nodules from the seabed using special machinery have been planned. This machinery will separate the nodules from the seabed rock layers and transport them to the surface via pipelines.

    海底珍藏
    锰是现代最需要的金属之一。在含有各种不同合金的火箭技术中需要大量的锰。但是产锰的资源却是不多的。它主要靠花费大而复杂的方法从海水中获取。
    科学家在海底的某些地带发现了许多矿瘤。这种像拳头般大的球形岩石含有25％的锰，15％的铁，还含有铜、镍及钴。目前已拟定出用特种机械从海底开采矿瘤的方法。这种机械将使矿瘤自海底石层上分离并沿输送管运至地面。
