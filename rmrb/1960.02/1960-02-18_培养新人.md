    The broad masses of working people in Hungary are launching a surge in learning culture and technology and have already achieved remarkable successes, promoting the development of production.
    At the same time, the Hungarian government is adopting new measures to bring education further closer to production and life. This year, comprehensive technical education will continue to be vigorously promoted in primary schools, and a system of five days of study and one day of labor will be implemented in secondary schools.
    On the one hand, vigorously improving the cultural and technical level of the workers and peasants, and on the other hand, making education closer to production and increasing students' labor skills, these are two indispensable aspects of cultivating new socialist construction talents, and an effective step in eliminating the difference between mental and manual labor. The measures taken by Hungary will undoubtedly greatly promote Hungary's socialist construction.

    培养新人
    匈牙利广大劳动人民正掀起一个学习文化技术的热潮，并且已经取得了显著的成就，促进了生产的发展。
    与此同时，匈牙利政府为使教育和生产、生活进一步接近，采取了新的措施。今年将在小学继续大力推行综合技术教育，在中学推行五天学习、一天劳动的制度。
    一方面大力提高工农群众的文化技术水平，一方面使教育接近生产，增加学生的劳动技能，这是培养新型社会主义建设人才的不可偏废的两个方面，也是消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动差别的一个有效步骤。匈牙利所采取的这些措施，无疑地将大大促进匈牙利的社会主义建设。
