　　Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou. Fujian Province's agricultural machinery departments' 70,000 employees are vigorously manufacturing and repairing agricultural machinery and tools to support spring plowing. The province has already produced more than 660,000 pieces of improved tools and semi-mechanized farm implements such as deep plows, rice transplanters, seeders, and fertilizer accumulating and transporting implements, an increase of 3.1 times compared to the same period last year. In addition, millions of pieces of small farm tools such as hoes and sickles have also been produced.

　　Farm tool factories and machinery factories in various localities have dispatched large numbers of workers to the countryside to repair and assemble agricultural machinery and tools for the people's communes. Fifteen workers from the Fuzhou Sixth Machinery Factory went to Gushan early in the morning on the second day of the Lunar New Year to carry back three broken diesel engines and water pumps, rushed to repair them, and then sent them back to the farmers. The farm tool factories at all levels in Yongtai County organized 145 mobile teams to carry tools to the countryside, making and repairing more than 26,000 pieces of farm tools for the farmers.

    福建农业机械七万职工大造新式农具
    据新华社福州讯　福建省农业机械部门的七万名职工大造大修农业机械和农具，支援春耕生产。全省已制造深耕犁、插秧机、播种机、积肥运肥用等改良工具和半机械化农具六十六万多件，比去年同期增加三点一倍。另外还生产了锄头、镰刀等小农具几百万件。
    各地农具厂和机械厂都派出大批工人下乡为人民公社修配农业机械和农具。福州第六机器厂的十五个工人在农历正月初二一早，就到鼓山抬回了三台用坏了的柴油机和抽水机，赶修好了再送给农民。永泰县各级农具厂组织了一百四十五个流动组携带工具下乡，登门为农民新制和修补了两万六千多件农具。
