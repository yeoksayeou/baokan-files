Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi Telegram: The labor emulation campaign launched by factories and mines in North Vietnam to complete the 1960 and the national three-year plan ahead of schedule is developing vigorously. As of the 15th, some enterprises and workshops have overfulfilled their production plans for the first half and the entire month of February.

From the very beginning, this labor emulation campaign expanded into a challenge and response between factories. The high targets put forward by various factories and mines fully demonstrate the high aspirations of the broad masses of workers. The Hanoi Machine Factory took the lead in proposing to complete the 1960 plan two to three months ahead of schedule. As of the 17th, seven factories had responded to the Hanoi Machine Factory's emulation initiative. The Haiphong Power Plant, in its challenge letter to the Hanoi Machine Factory, guaranteed to comprehensively overfulfill this year's production plan and complete the national three-year plan five months ahead of schedule.

In order to achieve the emulation targets, workers launched a movement of "learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced," and new production records are constantly emerging. Since February, four of the five working faces in the Victory Mine of the Hong Gai Coal Mine in the Vietnamese coal mine base have created high-yield records. The original plan was to produce 32 truckloads of coal per shift per day. In January, workers broke through the original target and created a record of 84 truckloads per shift per day. Now, they have raised it to 109 to 245 truckloads, creating the highest record on the coal production front in North Vietnam.

The workers' spirit of daring to think, daring to act, and courageously innovating and carrying out technical innovations has been further developed in the emulation campaign. Overcoming difficulties in technology and raw materials, the workers of the Gia Lam Machine Factory in Hanoi recently successfully manufactured the first brick-making machine designed by the construction sector itself, and it was officially handed over to the Hanoi Brick Factory for use on February 18.

Recently, according to newspaper reports, the Central Emulation Committee of Vietnam issued a notice to all localities, calling for vigorously launching a patriotic emulation movement to victoriously complete the 1960 national plan.

The notice pointed out that 1960 is a year with many important political events and also a year for completing the socialist transformation in the North and preparing to stride into the first five-year plan. The notice said that this is a good opportunity for the entire party and the entire people to enhance their patriotic and socialist spirit.

The notice called on all departments and localities to launch a movement to "strive to become advanced producers and advanced production teams"; and required all localities to do a good job in political and ideological work, carry out technical innovation, launch creative movements, and promote competition between units.

At present, the upsurge of labor emulation is continuing to rise in all parts of Vietnam. The famous Cam Pha Coal Mine has put forward an emulation initiative to fraternal mines to overfulfill the production plan, which has been enthusiastically responded to by Hong Gai and other coal mines.

The "learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced" production increase emulation campaign carried out by the Cam Pha Coal Mine is constantly setting new achievements. The workers of the "Victory" mine of this mine, under the slogan of "filling up the trucks and emptying the coal," have created high production records. The output of the second coal seam's production team has increased from 32 truckloads to 83 truckloads per shift per day. Workers have demonstrated a spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation in the competition, with each team cooperating to ensure the joint completion of tasks.

    做好政治思想工作　广泛展开技术革新
    越南厂矿企业劳动竞赛热火朝天
    中央竞赛委员会号召大力开展竞赛胜利完成今年计划
    新华社河内电　越南北方各厂矿企业为提前完成1960年和国家三年计划而开展的劳动竞赛，正在热火朝天地蓬勃发展。截至15日，一些企业和车间已经超额完成2月上半月和全月生产计划。
    这次劳动竞赛一开始就扩展为厂际之间的挑战应战，各厂矿提出的高额指标，充分表现了广大职工的雄心壮志。河内机器厂首先提出倡议，要提前二至三个月完成1960年计划。到17日止，已有七个工厂响应了河内机器厂竞赛倡议。海防发电厂在寄给河内机器厂的应战书上，保证全面超额完成今年的生产计划，并提前五个月完成国家三年计划。
    为了实现竞赛指标，工人们互相之间展开了“学先进、赶先进，超先进”的运动，新的生产纪录不断涌现。越南煤矿基地鸿基煤矿胜利矿井的五个工作面，2月份以来，有四个创造了高产纪录。这里原订每日每班产煤三十二车，1月间工人们突破了原订指标，创造了每日每班八十四车的纪录，但目前他们又提高到一百零九车到二百四十五车，创造了越南北方煤炭生产战线上的最高纪录。
    工人们敢想、敢做、勇于创造和进行技术革新的精神，在竞赛中得到进一步的发挥。河内嘉林机器厂职工克服了技术、原材料方面的困难，最近制造成功建筑部门自己设计的第一台制砖机，并且已经在2月18日正式移交河内砖厂使用。
    不久前，据报纸报道，越南中央竞赛委员会向各地发出通知，号召大力开展爱国竞赛运动，胜利完成1960年的国家计划。
    通知指出，1960年是具有许多重要政治意义事件的一年，也是完成北方社会主义改造事业和准备跨进第一个五年计划的一年。通知说，这是全党全民提高爱国精神和社会主义精神的良好机会。
    通知号召各部门和各地开展一个为“争取成为先进生产者和先进生产小组”的运动；要求各地做好政治思想工作，开展技术革新，发动创造运动，促进各单位之间的竞赛。
    目前，劳动竞赛热潮正在越南各地各部门继续高涨。著名的锦普煤矿向各兄弟矿提出了超额完成生产计划的竞赛倡议，得到鸿基等煤矿的热烈响应。
    锦普煤矿开展的“学先进、赶先进、超先进”的增产竞赛，不断树立新的成绩。这个矿的“胜利”矿场职工在“装满车，出净煤”的口号下，创造了高产纪录。第二煤层的生产组每班每天的采煤量由三十二车提高到八十三车。工人们在竞赛中发挥了互助协作的精神，各组互相配合，保证共同完成任务。
