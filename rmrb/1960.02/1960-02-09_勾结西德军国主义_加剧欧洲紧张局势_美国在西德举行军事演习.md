Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, February 8th: The large-scale military exercises of the US Seventh Army stationed in West Germany and the West German army, which began on January 29th, ended on February 7th.

　　This military exercise, held approximately one hundred kilometers from the border of the German Democratic Republic, was unprecedented in scale in West Germany. It involved more than 60,000 personnel and 15,000 military vehicles. The exercises were commanded by Americans. This was also the first time the West German army participated in US ground force exercises with large formations. The exercise itself fully demonstrates the close collusion between the US and West German militarism.

　　During the exercise, more than 200 senior NATO officers observed the firing of "Honest John" missiles.

　　The exercise also caused considerable losses to the people. According to West German newspapers, a total of eighty traffic accidents occurred during the large-scale exercise, resulting in ten deaths, forty-six injuries, and property damage amounting to more than 90,000 West German marks. In the Karlmunz area, US military vehicles ran over and killed a mother and daughter. Some US military tanks ran over non-combatants. Some US military vehicles crashed into West German cars on the highway, and some civilian houses were destroyed.

　　According to newspapers, purely military accidents during the exercise were not announced.

    勾结西德军国主义　加剧欧洲紧张局势
    美国在西德举行军事演习
    新华社波恩8日电　从1月29日开始的驻西德的美国第七军和西德军队的大规模军事演习已经在2月7日结束。
    这次军事演习是在距离德意志民主共和国边境约一百公里的地方举行的，规模在西德是空前的。参加的人数达六万多人，出动的军车有一万五千辆。演习由美国人指挥。这也是西德军队第一次以大编队参加美国的地面部队演习。演习本身充分表明美国和西德军国主义的密切勾结。
    在演习中有二百多名北大西洋集团高级军官参观了放射“诚实的约翰”式导弹的情况。
    演习还对人民造成了不少损失。据西德报纸报道，在这次大演习中共发生了八十次交通事故，十人因此死亡，四十六人受伤，财产损失达九万多西德马克。在卡耳穆恩茨地区，美军军车轧死了母女两人。有些美军坦克轧死了非战斗人员。有些美军汽车在大公路上撞坏了西德人的汽车，还有些民房被毁坏。
    据报纸说，演习中纯军事性的事故没有宣布。
