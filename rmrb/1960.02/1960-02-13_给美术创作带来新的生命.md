Having seen the Second Fine Arts Exhibition of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, I warmly cheer for the great achievements of the literary and artistic movement of our workers, peasants, and soldiers in implementing Comrade Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, and I sincerely wish that the art creation of our people's army will further achieve new and greater leaps forward on the existing foundation!

Generally speaking, the literary and artistic work of the People's Liberation Army has always been advancing in the direction indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." That is to say, "Since our literature and art are basically for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, then the so-called popularization means popularizing to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the so-called improvement means improving from the workers, peasants, and soldiers." Persistent efforts in this direction have proven to be completely correct; otherwise, we cannot imagine how such great achievements, both popular and improved, could be displayed before everyone.

From the more than 600 art works on display, we can see the rich content of the struggles and lives of the People's Liberation Army as defenders and builders of socialist construction. These are truly works of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Here, I am specifically referring to the vast soldiers and generals of the People's Liberation Army who come from worker and peasant backgrounds. Most of them are actually workers and farmers in military uniforms. They were always considered to be without cultural knowledge in the old society, and therefore despised everywhere. However, the revolutionary army not only gave them revolutionary ideological and political education, but also gave them cultural and technical knowledge. Their creative talents have since had ample opportunity to be brought into full play. Their art creation activities, like all their other creative activities, are full of vigorous fighting spirit and have distinct military characteristics. Every work before us undoubtedly reflects the vivid life and struggle of the People's Liberation Army. The themes here are very broad, and the forms of expression are diverse. Obviously, the authors felt strong excitement in the experience of actual life and struggle, and could not help but create, which is why so many excellent works were produced. It is said that the more than 600 works currently on display are only a part of the more than 4,500 works collected from various arms and services of the People's Liberation Army. In fact, the achievements of mass creation in the troops are far greater than what we have seen. We have every reason to say that the art creation of the People's Liberation Army has now become a mass movement. This mass creative movement is a movement that unifies popularization and improvement. It truly popularizes to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and thus countless art enthusiasts have emerged among the vast officers and soldiers; it truly improves from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and thus a large number of excellent authors have been cultivated among the countless art enthusiasts.

How should we estimate the great significance of such a massive mass movement of military art creation in the historical process of socialist and communist construction? Let us reread a passage from Marx. In "The German Ideology," Marx wrote:

"In any case, in the communist organization, the subordination of artists to local and national narrowness, which arises entirely from the division of labour, disappears, and it also prevents the artist from being confined to a particular art form and simply being a painter, sculptor, etc., so that only the name of his activity vividly expresses the limitations on his professional development and his dependence on the division of labour. In communist society, there are no painters, but only people who engage in painting as one of their activities."

We are now in the lower stage of communism—the stage of socialism. We must make the greatest efforts to achieve the complete realization of the communist ideal as soon as possible. In order to realize communism, we must pay attention at all times to creating conditions for eliminating the difference between mental and physical labor, just as we must create conditions for accelerating the elimination of the difference between city and countryside, industry and agriculture. In the process of socialist construction we are engaged in at this stage, we should actively cultivate communist factors at all times and in all places, and make great efforts to gradually transition to the higher stage of communism. In this sense, I believe that the art creation movement of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army has even more important significance that cannot be ignored. Because it shows that the commanders and fighters of our people's army are rapidly developing into "all-rounders" and becoming talented people with both literary and military skills. They have not only learned the science and technology of modern national defense, learned the skills to participate in various productive labor, but also can write poetry and paint, and can participate in various art creation activities. According to Marx, they have begun to break away from the restrictions of social division of labor and professional development, and have also begun to break through the shackles of specific artistic fields. Their works can prove that they are different from ordinary artists, but are closer to the people who will be needed in the future society to engage in art work. Under the current conditions, they can be called amateur art workers, because most of them can only engage in creation in their spare time. Only when they have created many exquisite works from the actual life of combat can this bring new life to our art.

Look at the works of our most beloved heroic warriors, who can not be inspired by the great vitality expressed in these works and feel infinitely surprised? The work of naval warrior Lang Zhuohong is a vivid example. I saw Lang Zhuohong's four Chinese paintings and two oil paintings on display, especially the oil painting "Rescuing Fishermen," which fully expresses the flesh-and-blood connection between our army and the people, and expresses the tense scene of them fighting against the raging waves at sea. Lang Zhuohong was originally a joint pen name of three naval warriors. They are Sergeant Zhao Yuxian, Private Zhou Yongjia, and Private Ran Maokui. All three came from poor peasant families, with only primary or junior high school education, and none of them could paint at first; but they had rich life experiences and longed to express the great themes they personally experienced in artistic form. Their joint pen name shows that they are excellent sons and daughters of the red, and their creative path is also the common path of many soldiers in the troops. There are many other works by soldiers of various arms and services. For example, the oil painting "The First Finished Product" by Sergeant Zhang Yongtai, the Chinese painting "Vegetable Garden on the Grassland" by Sergeant Zhang Zhihong, the "Chicken" painted by Private Bi Deqin, and the "Comparing Enthusiasm" painted by Private Li Kuigen all reflect the characteristics of actual life in different regions from different angles. The emergence of these works once again proves that the truth that art comes from life is indestructible.

It is also worth noting that in this exhibition, we also saw the works of the People's Liberation Army generals. The several Chinese paintings by Major General and Political Department Director Li Yimin—"Eagle and Chickens," "Pecking," and three kinds of flowers, should be said to be quite good works. Comrade Li Yimin uses his left hand for painting because his right hand is disabled, which makes it even more commendable. Since 1953, he has regarded learning Chinese painting as an important part of his spare time activities, often sacrificing summer naps and other rest time to learn painting. After several years of continuous learning, his painting skills have become very proficient. Similarly, "The Army and the People are Inseparable" painted by Major General and Deputy Minister Li Zhi, and the Chinese painting "Banana Frog" by Senior Colonel and Political Department Director Zhang Jialuo, are also worthy of recommendation. Unfortunately, I did not record all the contents of the good works I saw one by one, so I cannot express all my impressions very appropriately. However, I am deeply moved by these works and the creative spirit of their authors, and I really want to paint too.

There are many aspects to the works exhibited this time, including more than eighty Chinese paintings, more than forty oil paintings, more than one hundred and sixty prints, more than sixty New Year pictures, watercolors and gouache paintings, more than twenty propaganda paintings, more than thirty cartoons, more than twenty comic strips and illustrations, more than ten sketches and quick sketches, more than twenty paper-cuts, and more than sixty stage designs, sculptures and other art works. There are hundreds of authors, forming a fairly strong team and showing a very strong creativity. In addition to a large number of amateur authors and amateur works, there are also professional authors and professional works. For example, the works of well-known troop young painters Comrade Huang Zhou, Comrade Liu Qing and other well-known authors have been well received by visitors. Huang Zhou's several Chinese paintings such as "Feeding Pigs" and Liu Qing's "Rescuing Children", "Delivering Food", Xie Guangnian's "Sinking the Chiang Kai-shek Army's Taiping" and Han Ke's "Crossing the Sea Operation" and other oil paintings well cooperated and reflected the central task and important struggles of the troops. In addition, the works that have been well received by the audience are endless. For example, the "Long Live the Great Leap Forward", "Kinmen Sea Battle", "Blue Sea and Red Heart" painted by Yang Liezhang, a first-class combat hero of the Navy and Sergeant Engine Room Chief, and the long scroll "Farewell Picture" painted by film projectionist Guo Ximin on the scene of the volunteer army and the Korean people reluctantly parting, are also rare works. They everywhere expressed the close relationship between our people's army and the people, and expressed the great heroic spirit of our army fighting to defend the motherland, to defend peace, and to oppose imperialist aggression. These undoubtedly brought great vitality to our art creation.

I hope that after this exhibition, I will have the opportunity to see the publication of selected works. If there is a collection of fine art works of the People's Liberation Army, we will more easily promote the further development of the mass movement of military art creation, and it will be more conducive for military art workers to exchange experiences with each other and continue to popularize and improve the military art creation. When the next fine art exhibition of the People's Liberation Army is held, I believe that the flowers of the fine arts of the troops will bloom more brilliantly along with the continued great leap forward in various tasks of the troops.

    给美术创作带来新的生命
    邓拓
    看了中国人民解放军第二届美术作品展览会，我为我国工农兵的文艺运动贯彻执行毛泽东同志的文艺思想的伟大成绩而热烈欢呼，并且衷心地预祝我们人民军队的美术创作，在已有的基础上进一步实现新的更大的跃进！
    人民解放军的文艺工作，总的说来，一直是遵循着毛泽东同志在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话中所指示的方向前进。这就是说：“我们的文艺，既然基本上是为工农兵，那末所谓普及，也就是向工农兵普及，所谓提高，也就是从工农兵提高。”按照这个方向坚持努力，事实证明是完全正确的；否则我们就不能想像怎么会有现在这样既普及又提高的巨大成绩展示在大家的面前。
    从展出的六百多件美术作品中，我们可以看出人民解放军作为社会主义事业的保卫者和建设者的斗争和生活的丰富内容。这些是真正工农兵的作品。我在这里所说的工农兵，是特别指的由工农出身的人民解放军的广大士兵和将领。他们的大多数实际上是穿上军装的工人和农民。他们在旧社会中从来都被认为是没有文化知识的，因而处处受到轻视。但是，革命军队不仅给了他们以革命的思想政治教育，并且给了他们以文化技术知识。他们的创造才能从此有了充分发挥的机会。他们的美术创作活动，同他们的其他一切创造性的活动一样，充满着蓬蓬勃勃的战斗气息，具有鲜明的部队特点。摆在我们面前的每一件作品，无疑地都是人民解放军的实际生活和斗争的生动反映。这里的题材非常广泛，表现的形式多种多样。显然，作者们都是在实际生活和斗争的体验中，感到强烈的激动，不能不进行创作，因而才产生了这许多优秀的作品。据说现在展出的六百多件作品，还只是从人民解放军各个兵种各个部队征集的四千五百多件作品中挑选出来的一部分。实际上部队群众创作的成绩远比我们所看到的要大得多。我们完全有理由可以说，现在人民解放军的美术创作已经成为广大群众性的运动了。这个群众性的创作运动是普及和提高统一的运动。它真正向工农兵普及，因而在广大部队官兵中涌现出无数美术爱好者；它真正从工农兵提高，因而在无数的美术爱好者中培养出大批优秀的作者。
    对于如此声势浩大的军队美术创作的群众运动，我们应该怎样估计它在社会主义和共产主义建设的历史进程中的伟大意义呢？让我们重读马克思的一段话吧。在“德意志意识形态”一书中，马克思写道：
    “无论如何在共产主义社会组织中，消除了完全从分工而来的艺术家对于地方的和民族的局限性的屈服，也使得艺术家不要禁闭在某一艺术的范围内而仅仅作一个画家、雕刻家等等，所以单是他的活动的一个名称就充分鲜明地表现出他的职业发展的局限性和他对于分工的依赖性。在共产主义社会中，没有画家，而只有把绘画作为自己活动之一的人。”
    我们现在正处于共产主义的低级阶段——社会主义的阶段，我们今后一定要尽最大的努力，以求得共产主义理想早日完全实现。为要实现共产主义，我们就要时时刻刻注意为消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的差别创造条件，正如我们要为加速消灭城市和乡村、工业和农业之间的差别创造条件一样。我们在现阶段从事社会主义建设的过程中，应该随时随地积极培养共产主义的因素，为逐步过渡到共产主义的高级阶段作极大的努力。从这个意义上说，我认为人民解放军官兵们的美术创作运动更加具有不可忽视的重要意义。因为它显示了我们人民军队的指挥员和战斗员们正在迅速地发展成为“多面手”，成为文武双全的人才。他们不但学会了现代国防的科学技术，学会了参加各种生产劳动的本领，而且还能写诗作画，能够参加各种美术创作活动。按照马克思所说的，他们已经开始摆脱了社会分工和职业发展上的限制，也开始冲破了特定的艺术范围的束缚。他们的作品可以证明，他们已经不同于寻常的美术家，而是更接近于将来社会所需要的从事美术工作的人了。他们在现时的条件下，可以叫做业余的美术工作者，因为他们的最大多数只能以业余的时间从事创作。只有他们从战斗的实际生活中创造了许多精美的作品，这才给我们的艺术带来了新的生命。
    看看我们最可爱的英雄战士的作品吧，谁能不被这些作品表现的巨大生命力所鼓舞，而感到无限惊奇呢？海军战士郎卓红的作品就是一个鲜明的例证。我看到郎卓红展出的四幅中国画和两幅油画，特别是油画中的“抢救渔民”一幅，充分地表现了我们的军队和人民群众的血肉联系，表现了他们在海上同狂风巨浪搏斗的紧张场面。郎卓红原来是三个海军战士的联合笔名。他们是中士赵聿贤、下士周永家、下士冉茂魁。三人都出身于贫农的家庭，只有高小或初中的文化程度，起先都不会画；但是他们有丰富的生活，渴望用艺术形式来表现他们亲身经历的伟大题材。他们联合的笔名显示了他们是红色的优秀儿郎，他们的创作道路也正是许多部队战士们共同的道路。其他各兵种各部队战士的作品还很多。如中士张永太画的油画“第一件成品”、中士张志宏画的中国画“草原上的菜园”、上等兵毕德钦画的“鸡”、下士李奎根画的“比干劲”，都从不同的角度反映了不同地区实际生活的特点。这些作品的出现，又一次地证明了艺术来自生活的真理是颠扑不破的。
    还值得注意的是，在这个展览会中，我们也看到了解放军将领们的作品。少将政治部主任李逸民同志画的几幅中国画——“鹰与小鸡”、“啄”和三种花卉，应该说是相当好的作品。李逸民同志因为右手残废，绘画是用左手，这就更加难能可贵了。他从1953年起才把学习中国画作为自己的业余活动的重要项目，经常牺牲了夏天午睡和其他休息时间去学画，几年来不断学习，现在他的绘画技巧已经很熟练了。再如少将副部长李治同志画的“军民鱼水不可分”、大校政治部主任张加洛同志的中国画“芭蕉青蛙”等，同样是值得推荐的。可惜我没有一一记下曾经看到的好作品的全部内容，所以不能够很恰当地说出我的全部观感。但是，我深深地被这些作品和它们的作者的创作精神所感动，我简直也想画画了。
    这次展出的作品方面很多，其中有八十几幅中国画，四十几幅油画，一百六十几幅版画，六十几幅年画、水彩画和水粉画，二十几幅宣传画，三十几幅漫画，二十几幅连环画和插图，十几幅素描和速写，二十几幅剪纸，还有六十几件舞台设计、雕塑及其他美术作品。作者几百人，形成了相当强大的队伍，表现了非常旺盛的创造力。这里除了大批业余的作者和业余的作品以外，还有专业的作者和专业的作品。如大家所熟悉的部队青年画家黄胄同志、柳青同志及其他知名作者的作品都受到了参观者的好评。黄胄的“喂猪”等几幅中国画和柳青的“抢救孩子”、“送饭”，谢光年的“击沉蒋军太平号”，韩柯的“渡海作战”等几幅油画，都很好地配合和反映了部队的中心任务和重要斗争。此外，得到观众好评的作品是举不完的。例如，海军一等战斗功臣、中士轮机长杨列章同志画的“大跃进万岁”、“金门海战”、“碧海红心”，和电影放映员郭西民同志就志愿军与朝鲜人民依依难舍的情景绘成的“惜别图”长卷，也都是不易多见的作品。它们处处表现了我们人民军队同人民群众的亲密关系，表现了我们的军队为保卫祖国、为保卫和平、为反对帝国主义侵略而战斗的伟大英雄气概。这些无疑地给我们的美术创作带来了伟大的生命力。
    我希望在这次展览之后，有机会再看到这些作品选集的出版。如果有一本人民解放军美术作品选集，我们就更容易推动部队美术创作的群众运动进一步的发展，将更有利于部队美术工作者彼此交流经验，继续普及和提高部队的美术创作。等到下一届人民解放军美术作品展览会举行的时候，我相信，部队的美术之花，将随同部队各项工作的继续大跃进而更加灿烂地开放出来。
