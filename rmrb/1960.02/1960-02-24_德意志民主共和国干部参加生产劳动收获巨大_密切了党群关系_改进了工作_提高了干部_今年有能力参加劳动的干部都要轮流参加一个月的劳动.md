Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 23rd: According to information obtained by this reporter from relevant leading organs here, the measure of cadres of East German party organizations and state organs participating in one month of productive labor per year has achieved significant results after a year of trial implementation and is beginning to be institutionalized. Through this measure, the ties between the party and government leading organs and the masses have become closer, the leadership style has improved, and the broad masses of cadres have cultivated and strengthened their views of loving labor and learning from the working people.

Last January, after the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic made decisions respectively that party organizations and government organs cadres should participate in one month of productive labor each year, party organizations and state organs at all levels actively implemented this decision. Among the cadres participating in productive labor, including many central and local leading cadres, the vast majority went to work in factories, and some went to construction sites and the countryside.

The person in charge of the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party believes that strengthening the relationship between the party and the government and the masses is one of the most valuable gains from the participation of organ cadres in productive labor last year.

In their physical labor, the cadres earnestly learn from the workers, are not afraid of difficulties, use their professional knowledge to study production together with the workers, and help grassroots organizations carry out political work and policy propaganda, which is conducive to the development of grassroots work. In this way, the cadres quickly gained the understanding and trust of the workers and made friends with them. Therefore, the workers warmly welcome this policy of the party and the government. They said that the Socialist Unity Party not only leads the workers in direction but also supports and cares for us in specific production and life.

The participation of organ cadres in productive labor is also conducive to discovering and handling problems in a timely manner, which has become a very good method for improving leadership work. For example, there were different opinions on the issue of the amount of "daily labor quota" in some factories in the German Democratic Republic. Before participating in production, some cadres did not have a definite view on this issue, but after they personally participated in productive labor, they quickly had a clear view. Some leading cadres consciously examined their own leadership work when participating in production, and some leading organs improved their leadership work based on the information learned by the cadres participating in productive labor.

After participating in productive labor, many cadres have cultivated and strengthened their view of loving labor and take pride in participating in labor. They realize that going to production and learning from the working people is helpful to their own improvement.

This year, the party and state organs of the German Democratic Republic will further implement the measure of cadres participating in productive labor. It has now been decided that this year, all cadres who are capable of physical labor will participate in one month of labor in rotation, and more cadres will be assigned to key departments or weak links in a planned way to work.

    德意志民主共和国干部参加生产劳动收获巨大
    密切了党群关系　改进了工作　提高了干部
    今年有能力参加劳动的干部都要轮流参加一个月的劳动
    新华社柏林23日电　据本社记者从这里的有关领导机关方面了解，德意志民主共和国党组织和国家机关干部每人每年参加生产劳动一个月的措施，经过去年一年的试行，已取得显著成效，并开始制度化。通过这一措施，党和政府领导机关同群众的联系更加密切，领导作风有了改进，广大干部培养和增强了热爱劳动、向劳动人民学习等观点。
    去年1月，德国统一社会党中央和德意志民主共和国部长会议分别作出党组织和政府机关干部每年参加一个月生产劳动的决定后，各级党组织和国家机关都积极地执行了这个决定。在参加生产劳动的干部中，包括许多中央和地方的领导干部，他们绝大部分是到工厂劳动，也有一部分是到建筑工地和农村。
    统一社会党中央组织部负责人认为，密切党和政府同群众的关系是去年机关干部参加生产劳动的最有价值的收获之一。
    干部们在体力劳动中，认真向工人学习，不怕困难，运用专业知识同工人一起研究生产，帮助基层组织进行政治工作和政策宣传，有助于基层工作的开展。这样，干部们就很快地得到了工人们的了解和信任，并和他们结交了朋友。因此，工人非常欢迎党和政府的这一项政策。他们说，统一社会党不仅在方向上领导工人，而且在具体生产和生活中也支持和关怀我们。
    机关干部参加生产劳动还有利于及时发现和处理问题，成为改进领导工作的一个很好的方法。比如，“每日劳动定额”的多少问题在德意志民主共和国一些工厂中曾存在着不同意见。一些干部在参加生产前，对这个问题还没有定见，但是当他们亲自参加生产劳动后，很快地便有了明确的看法。一些领导干部在参加生产时有意识地检查自己的领导工作，还有一些领导机关根据参加生产劳动的干部所了解的情况，改进了领导工作。
    经过参加生产劳动，许多干部培养和增强了热爱劳动观点，以参加劳动为荣。他们体会到，到生产和劳动人民中去学习，有助于自己的提高。
    今年，德意志民主共和国的党和国家机关将进一步贯彻干部参加生产劳动的措施。现在已经决定，今年要做到所有有能力参加体力劳动的干部都轮流参加一个月的劳动，并有计划地分配更多的干部到重点部门或薄弱环节去劳动。
