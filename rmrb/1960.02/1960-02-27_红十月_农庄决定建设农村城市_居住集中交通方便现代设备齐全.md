    "Red October" Farm Decides to Build Rural Cities
    Concentrated Housing, Convenient Transportation, Complete Modern Equipment
    The general meeting of all members of the "Red October" collective farm in the Kirov region of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic decided that all members of the farm will move from 130 small villages to eight new-style urban large villages within the next seven to ten years.

    The leader of this farm, Prozorov, told a TASS reporter that the long-term plan for building urban-style villages stipulates that two-story or four-story houses with all modern equipment will be built. Each family will have a set of housing, and the number of rooms will be allocated according to the number of family members. The farm members can enjoy all public facilities free of charge. The village plans to build boarding schools, cultural palaces, cinemas, canteens, shops, and also open parks.

    The small cities of the farm are connected by roads, and buses belonging to the collective farm travel between them.

    The farm members decided to allocate 72 million rubles to build their own small cities.

    “红十月”农庄决定建设农村城市
    居住集中交通方便现代设备齐全
    苏联俄罗斯联邦共和国基洛夫州“红十月”集体农庄全体庄员大会上决定，农庄的全体庄员将于今后七年至十年内从一百三十个小村庄迁居到八个新型的城市式的大村庄去。
    这个农庄的领导人普罗佐罗夫对塔斯社记者说，建设城市式村庄的远景计划规定，要建造两层楼或四层楼的具有一切现代化设备的房子。每个家庭有一套住宅，房间的数目根据家庭人数多少而分配。庄员们可以免费享受一切公用设施。村庄中规定要建设寄宿学校、文化宫、电影院、食堂、商店，还要开辟公园。
    农庄小城市之间有公路相通，属于集体农庄的公共汽车来往其间。
    庄员们决定拨款七千二百万卢布来建设自己的小城市。
