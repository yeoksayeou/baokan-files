Xinhua News Agency, Changchun Telegram: Jilin Province has prepared sufficient fertilizer for spring plowing and sowing and is currently launching a crash program to transport fertilizer, striving to transport all manure to the fields before the thaw.

This year, Jilin Province requires an average application of 30 to 40 tons of base fertilizer per hectare of cultivated land, or 10 to 15 tons of "seed fertilizer" (fertilizer applied with the seeds at the time of sowing). Basic farmland requires both base fertilizer and seed fertilizer. According to this requirement, farmers in various regions began large-scale construction of fertilizer bases and the accumulation of scattered manure last winter. After several months of hard work, as of February 10, they had overfulfilled this fertilizer accumulation plan.

Since December of last year, people's communes in various regions have launched a crash fertilizer delivery campaign, taking advantage of the frozen rivers and land. Baicheng Prefecture and Huai'de and Yushu counties built more than 200,000 meters of ice roads, using sleds and ice carts to transport fertilizer, which doubled labor efficiency. Liaoyuan People's Commune in Liaoyuan City connected three sleds together to transport fertilizer on the ice road. One person and one horse transported more than 30,000 jin of fertilizer every day, increasing work efficiency by more than two times compared to the past. In the Siping and Baicheng areas, more than 50,000 pieces of fertilizer transportation tools were reformed, saving 100,000 laborers, and the daily progress of fertilizer transportation also increased by one and a half times. In order to solve the problem of insufficient tools, various regions also used sledgehammers, long drills, crowbars, and wheelbarrows freed up from water conservancy construction sites to dig or transport manure.

    吉林突击送肥
    每公顷耕地计划施底肥三十至四十吨
    据新华社长春电　吉林省春耕播种所需的肥料已经备足，目前正在突击运肥，力争在解冻前将粪肥全部运到田里。
    今年，吉林省每公顷耕地要求平均施底肥三十到四十吨，或施口肥（播种时随同种子下地的肥料）十到十五吨。基本田要求既施底肥又施口肥。根据这一要求，各地农民从去年冬季就开始大建肥料基地和大积零星粪肥，经过几个月的奋战，到2月10日，已超额完成了这一积肥计划。
    从去年12月开始，各地人民公社就乘河封地冻的时机，展开了突击送肥运动。白城地区和怀德、榆树两县修建了长达二十多万米的冰道，利用爬犁、冰车运肥，劳动效率成倍提高。辽源市辽源人民公社将三张爬犁联结一起在冰道运肥，一人一马每天运肥三万多斤，工效比原来提高两倍多。四平、白城地区改革了五万多件运肥工具，节约劳力十万个，运肥的日进度还提高一倍半。为了解决工具不足的问题，各地还将水利工地腾下来的大锤、长钎、撬杠和推车等工具用来起粪或运肥。
