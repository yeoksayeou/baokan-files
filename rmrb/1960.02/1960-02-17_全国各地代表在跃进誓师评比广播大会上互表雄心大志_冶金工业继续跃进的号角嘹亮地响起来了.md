Xinhua News Agency, 16th - The clarion call for the continued Great Leap Forward in China's metallurgical industry in 1960 has resounded loudly. Today, at the National Metallurgical Industry 1960 Comprehensive Great Leap Forward Pledging and Appraisal Broadcast Conference held in Beijing, representatives from metallurgical enterprises across the country exchanged their ambitious goals, determined to seize the fruits of the continued Great Leap Forward in 1960 on the foundation of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959.

　　At today's broadcast conference, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the National Committee of the Heavy Industry Trade Union awarded over two hundred and sixty red flags to red banner units in the national metallurgical industry sector, and over three thousand eight hundred certificates of merit to advanced units. These units all achieved outstanding accomplishments in the process of the Great Leap Forward in China's metallurgical industry in 1959. Their advanced experiences have been summarized by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry by category and are being promoted throughout the country.

　　Bo Yibo, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, attended today's conference. He first extended cordial greetings to all workers laboring valiantly in various posts of the metallurgical industry, and expressed warm congratulations to the four thousand plus red banner units and advanced collectives who received awards. Bo Yibo said that in the past, we have used two years to complete the journey of five years. In the next ten years, the lofty aspirations of the Chinese people are: to better realize the continuous leap forward of the entire 1960s, to catch up with and surpass Britain in terms of the output of major industrial products, to basically establish China's complete industrial system, and to basically realize the modernization of industry, agriculture, and science and culture, and to build our motherland into a strong socialist country. To achieve this goal, we should start from the first year and the first spring of the 1960s and fully realize our comprehensive leap forward. Under the overall situation in the country, the metallurgical industry bears an extremely glorious and huge task. We must, under the policy of "taking steel as the key link and making a comprehensive leap forward," strive to produce a large amount of steel and various non-ferrous metals at the highest speed, to meet the ever-growing needs of all sectors of the national economy.

　　Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, also participated in today's conference and spoke.

　　Today's broadcast conference was jointly organized by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the National Committee of the Heavy Industry Trade Union, and the Central People's Broadcasting Station.

　　Lu Dong, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, spoke at the meeting. He said that in 1960, our task is to continue to strive for the high-speed development of the metallurgical industry, and to strive for a better and more comprehensive leap forward in the metallurgical industry. To achieve this comprehensive leap forward, the key lies in the fact that all metallurgical industry workers must have lofty aspirations and greater drive.

　　In order to achieve new and greater victories in the metallurgical industry in 1960, Lu Dong put forward five tasks to the national metallurgical workers:

　　First, all metallurgical enterprises must formulate a production plan that is full of vigor and determination to greatly over fulfill the state's plan. Whether in terms of increasing equipment utilization rate, expanding product varieties, improving product quality, reducing production costs, and increasing labor productivity, we must establish ambitious goals and strive to be among the best.

　　Second, vigorously grasp the "small-scale, indigenous groups" and further implement the policy of walking on two legs. The iron and steel industry must improve the production technology level of existing "small-scale, indigenous groups," and at the same time, develop a batch of "small-scale, indigenous groups" into joint enterprises in a planned way, and appropriately increase some "small-scale, indigenous groups" where conditions permit. The non-ferrous metal industry must also greatly develop "small-scale, indigenous groups." Large, medium, and small metallurgical enterprises should carry out competitions, and "small-scale, indigenous groups" should be pioneers in technological revolution.

　　Third, carry out basic construction at high speed to add more new forces to the metallurgical industry.

　　Fourth, rapidly occupy the new fields of "high, large, precise, advanced, and new," and climb the peak of metallurgical science and technology.

　　Fifth, adhere to putting politics in command and vigorously carry out mass movements. While vigorously carrying out mass movements, we must continuously improve enterprise management and continuously promote the development of productive forces.

　　Representatives from Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, Shanghai, Yunnan and Sichuan Metallurgical Halls (Bureaus), Hunan Metallurgical Bureau Exploration Company 238 Team, Shouwangfen Copper Mine, and Anshan Coking and Refractory Materials Design Institute spoke at the broadcast conference today. They respectively put forward new goals for this year and various measures to ensure the realization of these goals in terms of steel, non-ferrous metals, exploration, and design.

　　Yuan Zhen, First Secretary of the Party Committee of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and Manager of Angang, said that in order to ensure the completion of the 1960 plan ahead of schedule and in excess, we must resolutely implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, continue to strengthen the Party's leadership, use the method of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and combining large, medium, and small scales to solve key production problems, and at the same time combine vigorously carrying out mass movements with strengthening enterprise management. Yuan Zhen emphasized that we must do everything possible to achieve high yield, high quality, multiple varieties, and low consumption requirements in steel, iron, steel products, and other aspects, and make leap forward after leap forward on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1959 and January 1960.

　　Xu Yan, Director of Shanghai Metallurgical Bureau, said that in 1960, Shanghai's metallurgical industry should focus on varieties, quality, cutting-edge technology, and high speed, and greatly improve labor productivity while ensuring the completion of the production plan. He proposed that this year Shanghai will comprehensively promote advanced experiences such as mixed steelmaking and hot blast operation, so that the varieties and quality of converter steel reach the level of open-hearth furnaces; expand the proportion of high-quality steel and alloy steel in open-hearth steel. At the same time, it is necessary to greatly increase the variety of steel products, vigorously carry out the technical innovation movement, and increase the labor productivity of all employees in the entire metallurgical industry by more than 50%, so as to increase production while reducing personnel and support the construction of new factories.

　　Li Yiqing, Secretary of the Party Committee of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company and General Manager of Wugang, a red banner unit in metallurgical industrial basic construction, introduced the great victory and basic experience of achieving high speed and high quality in the construction of Wugang in 1959 in his speech. Li Yiqing said that this year, Wugang's construction tasks have a greater increase than in 1959. Our policy is to grasp both ends and bring the middle, ensure the construction of the mine; ensure that the roughing, large, and plate rolling steel systems are completed and put into production ahead of schedule, and that the construction of two open-hearth furnaces and one coke oven is completed ahead of schedule.

　　Li Wenda, Deputy Director of the Sichuan Provincial Metallurgical Hall, and Yue Xiaoxia, Director of the Yunnan Provincial Metallurgical Hall, used vivid examples in their speeches to unanimously point out that the iron and steel "small-scale, indigenous groups" enterprises have incomparably strong vitality and broad development prospects. Li Wenda said that the more than two hundred and seventy newly built iron smelting "small-scale, indigenous groups" in Sichuan Province are currently fully launching the "four ones" movement, that is, each cubic meter of blast furnace volume produces more than one ton of iron per day and night, the sulfur content of pig iron accounts for less than 0.1%, the coke consumption per ton of iron is less than one ton, and the labor force used to smelt one ton of iron is less than one hundred people (including mine and transportation personnel). If this requirement is achieved, the province can increase the production of about 1,000 tons of pig iron per day, and can also greatly increase the output of steel and steel products, save labor, and significantly reduce costs. Yue Xiaoxia said that in the fourth quarter of last year, the average cost of pig iron in small blast furnaces in Yunnan Province has been reduced to 179 yuan per ton, which has achieved the cost target set by the state ahead of schedule; this year, management should continue to be strengthened, and the cost of each ton of pig iron should be reduced to 150 yuan.

　　Today, the meeting place of the Central Broadcasting Building was filled with the joy of victory and the fighting passion of welcoming new tasks. The guarantee conditions and measures proposed by each representative at the central venue, the production good news and challenges and response letters from metallurgical workers listening to the conference broadcast from thousands of miles away, repeatedly aroused bursts of thunderous applause. In January this year, the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in Anhui Province reached 1.679, exceeding the average utilization coefficient of large and medium-sized blast furnaces in the country in 1959. Today, the representative of the Anhui Provincial Metallurgical Industry Department, on behalf of the small blast furnace workers of the province, proposed to launch a competition with the large and medium-sized blast furnaces across the country, and determined to further increase the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in the province to 1.8 this year, which aroused the enthusiastic response of blast furnace workers listening to the conference broadcast across the country.

    新华社16日讯　1960年我国冶金工业继续跃进的号角嘹亮地响起来了。今天，在北京举行的全国冶金工业1960年全面跃进誓师评比广播大会上，来自全国各地冶金企业的代表，互表雄心大志，决心在1958和1959两年大跃进的基础上，夺取1960年继续跃进的果实。
    在今天的广播大会上，冶金工业部和重工业工会全国委员会把二百六十多面红旗授给了全国冶金工业部门的红旗单位，把三千八百多张奖状授给了先进单位。这些单位在1959年我国冶金工业大跃进的过程中，都获得了突出的成就，它们的先进经验已经由冶金工业部分门别类地总结出来，正在全国各地推广。
    中共中央政治局候补委员、国务院副总理薄一波出席了今天的大会。他首先向冶金工业各个岗位上奋勇劳动的全体职工致亲切的慰问，并向四千多个得奖的红旗单位和先进集体，表示热烈的祝贺。薄一波说，过去，我们已经用两年的时间走完了五年的路程。今后十年，我国人民的雄心大志是：更好地实现整个六十年代的连续跃进，在主要工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国，基本上建立起我国完整的工业体系，并基本上实现工业、农业和科学文化的现代化，把我们祖国建成为一个强大的社会主义国家。为了达到这个目标，我们应该从六十年代的第一年和第一个春天开始，就全力来实现我们的全面跃进。在全国总的形势下，冶金工业担负着极其光荣而巨大的任务。我们必须在“以钢为纲、全面跃进”的方针下，争取用最高速度生产大量的钢铁和多种有色金属，满足国民经济各部门不断增长的需要。
    中华全国总工会主席刘宁一、共青团中央委员会第一书记胡耀邦，也参加了今天的大会并且讲了话。
    今天的广播大会是由冶金工业部、重工业工会全国委员会和中央广播电台联合举办的。
    冶金工业部副部长吕东在会上讲话。他说，1960年，我们的任务是继续争取冶金工业的高速度发展，争取冶金工业更好更全面的跃进。要实现这个全面跃进，关键在于全体冶金工业职工要有一个雄心大志，和更大的干劲。
    为了取得1960年冶金工业新的更大的胜利，吕东向全国冶金职工提出了五项任务：
    第一，各冶金企业要制订一个鼓足干劲的生产计划，决心大大地超额完成国家的计划。不论在提高设备利用系数、扩大产品品种、提高产品质量、降低生产成本和提高劳动生产率等方面，都要树立雄心大志，力争上游。
    第二，大抓“小洋群”，进一步贯彻执行两条腿走路的方针。钢铁工业要提高已有“小洋群”的生产技术水平，同时，有计划地把一批“小洋群”发展成为联合企业，在有条件的地方适当地增加一些“小洋群”。有色金属工业也要大大地发展“小洋群”。大、中、小冶金企业之间要开展竞赛，“小洋群”要在技术革命中打先锋。
    第三，高速度地进行基本建设，为冶金工业增加更多的新生力量。
    第四，迅速攻占“高、大、精、尖、新”的新领域，攀登冶金科学技术的高峰。
    第五，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。在大搞群众运动的同时，要不断地改善企业管理工作，不断地促进生产力的发展。
    鞍山钢铁公司，武汉钢铁公司，上海、云南和四川冶金厅（局），湖南冶金局勘探公司二三八队，寿王坟铜矿以及鞍山焦化耐火材料设计院的代表，今天先后在广播大会上发言，他们分别就钢铁、有色金属、勘探、设计等方面，提出了今年新的奋斗目标和保证实现这些目标的各项措施。
    中共鞍山钢铁公司党委第一书记兼鞍钢经理袁振说，为了保证提前超额完成1960年的计划，我们要坚决贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，继续加强党的领导，用土洋结合、大中小结合的办法，解决生产上的关键问题，同时把大搞群众运动和加强企业管理结合起来。袁振强调说，我们一定要千方百计地在钢、铁、钢材和其他各方面，实现高产优质、多品种、低消耗的要求，在1959年和1960年1月份大跃进的基础上，跃进再跃进。
    上海市冶金局局长许言说，1960年，上海冶金工业要在保证生产计划完成的基础上，大力抓品种，抓质量，抓尖端技术，抓高速度，大大提高劳动生产率。他提出，今年上海市将全面推行混合炼钢、热风操作等先进经验，使转炉钢的品种和质量达到平炉水平；扩大平炉钢中优质钢和合金钢的比例。同时，要大力增加钢材品种，大搞技术革新运动，使整个冶金工业全员劳动生产率提高50％以上，做到增产减人，支援新厂建设。
    冶金工业基本建设方面的红旗单位——武汉钢铁公司的党委书记、武钢总经理李一清，在发言中介绍了1959年武钢建设中取得高速优质的巨大胜利和基本经验。李一清说，今年，武钢的建设任务比1959年有更大的增长，我们的方针是抓两头、带中间，保证建设好矿山；保证初轧、大型、板轧等轧钢系统提前建成和投入生产，并且提前建成两座平炉、一座焦炉等工程。
    四川省冶金厅副厅长李文达和云南省冶金厅厅长岳肖峡在发言中，用生动的事例，一致指出钢铁“小洋群”企业具有无比强大的生命力和广阔的发展前景。李文达说，四川省新建起来的二百七十多个炼铁“小洋群”，目前正在全面展开“四一”运动，即每立米高炉容积每昼夜产铁一吨以上，生铁含硫量占0．1％以下，每炼一吨铁耗用焦炭一吨以下，炼一吨铁使用劳动力一百人（包括矿山、运输人员）以下。实现了这个要求，全省每天就可以增产约一千吨生铁，还可以大大增产钢和钢材的产量，节约劳动力和大幅度地降低成本。岳肖峡说，去年第四季度，云南全省小高炉的生铁成本，平均每吨已经降低到一百七十九元，提前实现了国家规定的成本指标；今年要继续加强管理，把每吨生铁的成本再降低到一百五十元。
    今天，中央广播大厦的会场上，洋溢着胜利的欢乐和迎接新任务的战斗激情。中心会场上每一个代表提出的保证条件和措施，各地收听大会广播的冶金职工们从千里迢迢以外传来的生产捷报和挑战、应战书，一再激起一阵阵春雷般的掌声。今年1月份，安徽省小高炉的平均利用系数达到一点六七九，超过了1959年全国大中型高炉平均利用系数的水平。今天，安徽省冶金工业厅代表全省的小高炉职工，向全国大、中型高炉提出开展竞赛的倡议，决心在今年内把全省小高炉平均利用系数进一步提高到一点八，这个倡议引起了全国各地收听大会广播的高炉职工们的热烈响应。
