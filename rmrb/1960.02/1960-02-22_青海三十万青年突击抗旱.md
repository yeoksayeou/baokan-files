Qinghai – Under the unified leadership of the communes, 300,000 youths in Qinghai have organized more than 4,000 shock brigades to seize the time for planting and combat drought. With the ambitious goal of “intercepting and storing mountain water, blocking meltwater, diverting underground water, and exhausting spring water, so that all water benefits the fields,” they have plunged into the battle of combating drought and sowing seeds.

After the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions on drought resistance, youths in various regions widely launched special debates on "Can we overcome the drought?", "How can we overcome the drought?", and "What are the benefits of early planting for increased agricultural production?". These debates inspired the youth in the fight against drought. A campaign to seize the time for spring plowing, early planting with moisture conservation, and drought prevention and resistance has been rapidly launched throughout the province. In Manping Commune, Minhe County, more than 500 young people organized 25 youth shock brigades. In just five days, they dug 18 springs, sank 14 wells, carried ice to irrigate 300 mu of fields, swept snow to return it to 280 mu of fields, and tilled the land to conserve moisture on more than 58,600 mu. Youths in Mutual Assistance County also launched shock activities to prevent and resist drought.
