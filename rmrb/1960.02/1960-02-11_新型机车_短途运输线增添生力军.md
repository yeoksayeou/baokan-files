Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Electric: The Shanxi Automobile Manufacturing Plant recently trial-produced a new type of diesel-powered locomotive suitable for short-distance transportation in industrial and mining enterprises. It will be mass-produced this year for use by factories, mines, and transportation departments.

The speed of this locomotive is 30 kilometers per hour, with a maximum traction force of 4,800 kilograms, and a towing weight of 100 to 200 tons. One locomotive can tow the equivalent of the cargo carried by forty to fifty trucks, while the fuel consumption is similar to that of ordinary trucks. This locomotive is easy to operate, has low machine noise, runs smoothly, brakes safely, and has low fuel consumption. Operational tests have proven that the performance of all parts is good.

The engine, transmission, drive system, suspension, running gear, braking system, and car body of this locomotive are all manufactured by the Shanxi Automobile Manufacturing Plant itself.

    新型机车
    短途运输线增添生力军
    据新华社太原电　山西汽车制造厂最近试制成一种适于工矿企业短途运输用的新型柴油内燃机机车。今年它将成批生产，供应厂矿企业和交通运输部门使用。
    这种机车的速度每小时为三十公里，最大牵引力四千八百公斤，拖运重量一百到二百吨。一台机车可以拖运相当于四、五十辆载重汽车载运的货物，而燃料消耗量却同一般的载重汽车相差不多。这种机车操纵简便，机器声音小，行驶平稳，制动安全，耗油量低。经过运行证明：各部分性能都良好。
    这种机车的发动机、变速装置、传动装置和悬挂、行路、制动装置以及车身等，都是山西汽车制造厂自己制造的。
