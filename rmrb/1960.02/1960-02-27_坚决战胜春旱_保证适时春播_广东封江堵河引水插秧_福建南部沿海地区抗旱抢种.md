Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou -- Under the leadership of the Party, the people of Guangdong, filled with confidence, are fighting the spring drought and vigorously carrying out drought prevention and resistance activities, determined to complete the spring plowing tasks early, quickly, and well, according to the original leaping progress requirements.

This year, the sowing and rice seedling cultivation of early rice in various parts of Guangdong began about a month earlier than in previous years, starting around the "Beginning of Spring." By February 17, the province had completed 54% of its sowing plan. Therefore, the early rice transplanting time in various places should also be advanced accordingly. In order to ensure the completion of early rice and various spring planting tasks, various regions have taken a series of positive measures for drought prevention and resistance: First, sealing rivers and dams to lift river water for irrigation or divert water into ponds for storage. Second, fully utilizing dams to divert water for irrigation early; in coastal areas, seizing the favorable opportunity of the high tide in recent days to use the tide to raise the water level and divert water for soil preparation early. Third, newly built water conservancy projects are to be put into use as soon as possible after safety measures are taken, striving to store water ahead of schedule; for those that have stored water but have not yet built channels, concentrate efforts to rush to repair them, striving to bring the benefits of the projects into play early. Fourth, strengthen water management, implement rational and economical water use, and ensure that every drop of water returns to the fields.

The heroic people of Guangdong Province, who once overcame the extraordinary flood disaster of 1959, are full of strong confidence in thoroughly overcoming the spring drought, ensuring a bumper harvest of early crops, and realizing the continued leap forward in agricultural production. At present, the basic farmland construction work centered on water, fertilizer, and soil has achieved brilliant results in various places. As of now, the province has completed more than 200,000 large and small farmland water conservancy projects, of which more than 250 projects benefit more than 10,000 mu, and it is expected to expand and improve the irrigation area by 15.78 million mu. In many areas that have historically suffered from severe drought, the water conservancy area has been greatly expanded this year.
	For example, in the northern part of the Leizhou Peninsula, thanks to the construction of the Hedi Reservoir and the excavation of the Youth Canal, a network of waterways crisscrosses the area, no longer the barren land it used to be. The work of deep plowing and soil improvement in various places has also been done quickly and well. The original plan was to expand the deep plowing area by 10 million mu, and 10.24 million mu have now been completed; the original plan was to improve 5 million mu of low-yield land, and 7.23 million mu have now been completed. In terms of fertilizer accumulation, the province has accumulated an average of more than 200 dan of fertilizer per mu of cultivated land, of which high-quality manure and green manure account for about 40 dan; about two-thirds of the province's early rice fields have been fertilized with base fertilizer. These achievements have not only laid a solid material foundation for continued leap forward this year, but also won the initiative in current drought resistance and prevention work, ensuring the smooth progress of spring plowing and spring planting.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou -- Members of people's communes in the coastal areas of southern Fujian Province are determined to achieve "fighting drought to make spring plowing a success, ensuring a bumper harvest without rain." They are rushing to plant early rice and economic crops such as peanuts and sugarcane while fighting the drought. The spring harvest crops that have suffered from drought are also growing well after being irrigated, and a bumper harvest is in sight.

In coastal areas such as Minhou, Jinjiang, and Longxi in Fujian, rainfall has been low in recent months, and the temperature has been higher than in previous years, with high evaporation. Many places have experienced spring drought, which seriously threatens spring plowing and the late-stage irrigation of spring harvest crops. In order to overcome the spring drought, complete spring plowing in a timely manner, and seize a bumper harvest of spring crops, these areas, under the strong leadership of Party committees at all levels, have given full play to the superiority of the people's communes and put forward the slogan of "fighting drought to the end, ensuring a bumper harvest even without rain." On the one hand, they are rushing to repair a large number of new water conservancy projects to ensure that they can play a role before spring plowing; on the other hand, they are focusing on the supporting work of water conservancy projects and the annual repairs of existing water conservancy projects, opening up water sources and storing water early to fight drought, thus greatly reducing the threat of drought. Up to now, the Longxi area has newly built more than 17,000 water conservancy projects, ensuring that production such as sowing and seedling cultivation, and spring plowing can proceed as usual. The Wujiang Commune in Zhangpu County has increased water storage by building canals along the mountains, digging spring water to open ponds, deepening ditches and building high dams to block rivers, dividing water into multiple channels, and raising and reinforcing reservoirs and mountain ponds.

In the spring irrigation for drought resistance in various places, water use systems have been generally established, water use methods have been improved, attention has been paid to water conservation, and every drop of water has been returned to the fields. The Fugong Commune in Haicheng County has also promoted methods such as changing furrow irrigation to ditch irrigation, irrigating every other ditch, using living water first and then using water mixed with fertilizer, and irrigating rice seedling fields and wheat fields first and then irrigating rice paddies, thereby expanding the irrigated area.

In the fight against drought and for a bumper harvest, the broad masses of commune members are full of vigor and soaring enthusiasm, firmly believing that man can conquer nature. They have adopted various methods such as repairing, digging, opening, draining, irrigating, lifting, bailing, carting, and carrying, fighting day and night, trying every possible means to divert water to irrigate fields and water wheat. In Minhou County, more than 60,000 mu of wheat and barley affected by drought were generally irrigated once in seven days. The Jinjiang area has persisted in fighting drought for several months, so that the 1.8 million mu of spring harvest crops affected by drought have been generally irrigated two to four times or more. Now, most of the spring harvest crops in this area are growing strong and full of grain.

    坚决战胜春旱  保证适时春播
    广东封江堵河引水插秧
    福建南部沿海地区抗旱抢种
    新华社广州讯　广东人民在党的领导下满怀信心地和春旱作斗争，大力展开防旱、抗旱活动，决心按照原定的跃进要求，又早又快又好地完成春耕任务。
    今年广东各地的早稻播种育秧，比往年提早一个月左右，早在
  “立春”前后就已开始，到本月17日止，全省播种计划已完成54％。因此，各地早稻插秧时间，也要相应提前。为了保证完成早稻和各种春播作物的种植任务，各地采取了一系列防旱、抗旱的积极措施：第一，封江堵河，把河水提引灌田或引水归塘储存。第二，充分利用陂头提早引水灌田；沿海地区，则抓紧这几天大潮的有利时机，利用潮水顶托的机会，提早引水拌田。第三，新修水利工程在尽快进行安全处置之后，力争提前蓄水；已蓄水而渠道未修的，集中力量突击抢修，争取提早发挥工程效益。第四，加强用水管理，贯彻合理用水和节约用水，做到滴水归田。
    曾经战胜1959年特大洪水灾害的英雄的广东省人民，对于彻底战胜春旱，保证早造大丰收，实现农业生产的继续跃进，充满了坚强的信心。现在，各地以水、肥、土为中心的农田基本建设工作，已经取得辉煌的成就。截至目前，全省已完成大小农田水利工程二十多万处，其中受益万亩以上的工程就有二百五十多处，预计可扩大和改善灌溉面积一千五百七十八万亩。许多历史上受旱严重的地区，今年的水利面积都大大扩大。
    如雷州半岛北部，由于鹤地水库的建成和青年运河的开凿，已经是水网纵横，再不是过去那种赤地千里的面貌。各地深翻改良土壤的工作，也做得又快又好，原计划扩大深耕面积一千万亩，现已完成一千零二十四万亩；原计划改良低产田土壤五百万亩，现已完成七百二十三万亩。积肥方面，全省平均每亩耕地已积肥料二百多担，其中优质的粪肥和绿肥约有四十担；全省早稻田约有三分之二已下基肥。这些成就不仅为今年继续跃进打下雄厚的物质基础，而且为当前开展抗旱、防旱斗争，保证春耕、春种顺利进行，赢得了工作上的主动。
    新华社福州讯　福建省南部沿海地区各人民公社社员坚决实现“抗旱闹春耕、无雨保丰收”，正在抗旱抢播早稻和花生、甘蔗等经济作物。受旱的春收作物在抗旱抢灌后，也都生长良好，丰收在望。
    福建闽侯、晋江和龙溪等沿海地区，近几个月来，降雨量少，再加气温比往年高，蒸发量大，不少地方发生了春旱，严重地威胁春耕和春收作物的后期灌溉。为了战胜春旱，及时完成春耕和夺取春收作物大丰收，这些地区在各级党委的坚强领导下，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，提出“抗旱到天头，无雨也要保丰收”的口号。一面突击抢修大批新的水利工程，保证在春耕前能发挥效益；一面大抓水利工程配套和原有水利工程的岁修工作，开辟水源，提早蓄水抗旱，因此大大减少了旱象威胁。到目前止，龙溪专区已新修了一万七千多处水利工程，保证了播种育秧、春耕溶田等生产照常进行。漳浦县浯江公社，采取傍山开渠、挖泉水开池塘、深沟高垒断河拦坝、多水分渠和加高、加固水库、山塘的办法增加了蓄水量。
    各地在抗旱春灌中，普遍建立了用水制度，改进用水方法，注意节约用水，作到滴水归田。海澄县浮宫公社还推广改畦灌为沟灌、隔沟灌，先用活水后用配水，先灌秧田、麦田后溶田等办法，扩大了灌溉面积。
    在抗旱保丰收中，广大社员意气风发、干劲冲天，坚信人定胜天。他们采用修、挖、开、排、灌、吊、戽、车、挑等各种办法，日夜奋战，千方百计引水灌田浇麦。闽侯县七天内就给受旱的六万多亩大小麦普遍灌了一次水。晋江专区几个月来坚持抗旱，使受旱的一百八十多万亩春收作物普遍灌水二次到四次以上。现在，这个专区的绝大部分春收作物都长得秆壮粒饱。
