    The picturesque Burmese capital, Yangon, has been filled with an unusual atmosphere these past few days. Every time night falls, thousands of spectators flock to the gate of the Myoma Outdoor Theatre, where the Chinese artists are performing beautiful folk songs and dances for their Burmese friends.

    On January 25th, under the auspices of U Chit Thoung, Minister of Culture of the Union of Burma, the China National Song and Dance Ensemble, led by the Chinese Cultural Friendship Delegation, held its opening performance in Yangon. U Myint Thein, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Burma, Deputy Prime Minister U Lun Baw and more than one hundred other high-ranking officials attended the ceremony. At the opening ceremony, Minister U Chit Thoung and Chu Tunan, head of the Chinese Cultural Delegation, both congratulated each other on the growing friendship between China and Burma. The Myoma Outdoor Theatre was decorated more beautifully than even for a festival. Twenty Chinese and Burmese national flags fluttered in the breeze on both sides of the stage, and the venue was brightly lit, filled with an atmosphere of "peace and friendship." The four thousand seats in the theater were filled long before the performance started, with another one thousand people standing to watch. The walls and gates around the theater were crowded with people hoping to catch a glimpse of the artistic grace of China.

    Chinese folk songs and dances have a long historical tradition. The programs brought by the China National Song and Dance Ensemble this time are a collection of the essence of national art, under the guidance of the literary and artistic policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," and through the active creation and refinement of the Great Leap Forward. Therefore, every performance is very lively and vivid. The superb dance skills and delicate and sincere performances of the actors deeply touched the hearts of the audience. In particular, dances such as "Harvest Dance," "Reba on the Grassland," and "People of All Ethnic Groups Celebrating the Harvest" repeatedly won enthusiastic applause from the audience.

    "Harvest Dance" is a children's dance that shows a group of innocent children playing hide-and-seek in a bountiful field. Cabbages are so big that the children can climb on them, and cotton bolls are so large that they can overwhelm them. The most amazing thing is that the actors wear children's masks and children's clothes, and are so short that they really look like toddlers. The audience was very active after watching this dance. The audience debated whether the actors were children or adults, until they took off their masks and the audience realized that they were all played by adults.

    "Reba on the Grassland" has a strong style of the Tibetan people. From the beginning, it attracted the audience tightly. The bright scenery makes people feel like they are seeing three-dimensional objects, and they cannot help but think of the magnificent scenery of "the sky is vast, the fields are boundless, and cattle and sheep can be seen when the wind blows the grass low." This dance is varied and full of vitality, jumping, rolling, somersaulting, and turning, with beautiful transitions and a lively scene. Coupled with the lyrical melody and the graceful dance of twelve Tibetan girls, the rhythm is bright and the posture is beautiful. The entire program is exciting and fully expresses the joyful mood of the liberated Tibetan artists singing about their happy lives on the vast grassland.

    "People of All Ethnic Groups Celebrating the Harvest" won even more enthusiastic cheers and applause from the audience. This dance reflects that under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups in our country established people's communes. Through the vigorous mass movement of the Great Leap Forward, not only has industrial and agricultural production achieved unprecedented harvests, but it has also further promoted the friendship and great unity among the people of all ethnic groups. When people are celebrating the great harvest, lively recreational activities come. Look, horses are galloping, tractors are moving, there are songs and dances, and the atmosphere is extremely lively. The music very cleverly intersperses melodies and dance rhythms with the characteristics of various ethnic groups in China, which makes the whole dance full of a strong atmosphere of life and strongly conveys the feeling of infinite joy of obtaining a harvest to the audience.

    Chinese songs and dances have great charm for Burmese friends. During the five performances from January 25th to 31st, many people watched three or four times in a row. On the nights of the 26th and 27th, there was a light rain, and each show still had about 5,000 spectators. Some watched with umbrellas, and those who did not have umbrellas did not want to leave halfway even if their clothes were soaked. They gave extremely high evaluations to the acting skills of the Chinese artists. Burmese Deputy Prime Minister U Lun Baw praised it unreservedly and said: "The performance was so good!" He suggested to Minister of Culture U Chit Thoung that Burmese artists should be well organized to learn Chinese dance art. He said that he had seen Chinese dances when he was young, but the actors at that time were all old men and children, and their movements were very slow, which was very different from the lively, lively and beautiful dance postures now. U Myint Thein, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and his wife said that the program was touching, the music was elegant, the dance steps were light, and they were all new programs that they had never seen before.

    U Maung Maung, Principal of the Burmese Art School, and U Ba Than, a famous musician, said that the programs performed by the China National Song and Dance Ensemble have another attractive unique style, and they also believe that the development speed of Chinese national art is really amazing. U Maung Maung said that the performance of the Chinese Song and Dance Troupe left the audience with a feeling of "beauty" and "joy."

    Many Burmese friends felt particularly kind and appreciative of the Burmese dance "Flowers of Mandalay" performed by several female members of the song and dance troupe and the Burmese song "Seagull" sung by Uyghur female singer Ayimunisha. Ayimunisha's "Seagull" was sung twice, and the curtain call was as many as four times, which was the first time in the history of Burmese performances. Some viewers said that her expression was very good and she sang the Burmese mood. Her singing was intertwined with the feelings of the audience, making the entire theater immersed in deep friendship. Moreover, Burmese friends admired her talent for learning the Burmese song in just a day or two after arriving. Burmese film actor U Tun Wai said: "It is rare for foreigners to sing Burmese songs so well."

    In response to the enthusiastic requests of the citizens of Yangon, the China National Song and Dance Ensemble continued to perform two shows on February 1st and 2nd, and has now left Yangon to meet more Burmese friends in Mawlamyine, Taunggyi, and Mandalay. We believe that through this friendly performance, the sincere "Pauk-Phaw" friendship between the people of China and Myanmar will be further deepened.

    中缅友谊的迎春花
    ——记中国民族歌舞团在仰光演出
    解力夫
    风景如画的缅甸首都——仰光，这几天又增加了一些不寻常的气氛。每当夜幕降临的时候，在柔美里虎露天剧场门前，车水马龙，数以千计的观众涌向剧场。在这里，中国的艺术家们为缅甸友人表演了优美的民间歌舞。
    1月25日，在缅甸联邦文化部长吴漆东主持下，中国文化友好代表团率领的中国民族歌舞团在仰光举行了演出开幕式。缅甸最高法院首席法官吴敏登、副总理吴伦博等一百多位高级官员出席了这一仪式。在开幕仪式上，吴漆东部长和中国文化代表团楚图南团长一致祝颂中缅两国的友谊日益增长。这天柔美里虎露天剧场，打扮得比节日还漂亮，舞台两旁二十面中缅国旗迎风飘展，场内彩灯齐明，满场充满着“和平友谊”的气氛。剧场上四千个席位，很早就坐满了，另加有站着观看的一千多人，而剧场四周的墙上，大门上，到处都爬满了拥挤着的人群，希望一瞻中国的艺术风采。
    中国的民族歌舞有着悠久的历史传统，而这次中央民族歌舞团所带来的节目，是在“百花齐放、推陈出新”的文艺方针指示下，集全国各民族艺术的精华，经过了大跃进的积极创造和提炼，因此每一个节目的演出，都很生动活泼。演员们高超的舞蹈技巧和细腻真挚的表演，深深打动观众的心。尤其是“丰收舞”、“草原上的热巴”和“各族人民庆丰收”等舞蹈，一次又一次的博得了观众的热烈鼓掌。
    “丰收舞”是一个儿童舞蹈，它表现了一群天真无邪的孩子在丰收田里捉迷藏的愉快生活。白菜大的可以给孩子们爬上去，棉花桃大的可以压倒孩子。最奇的是，扮演者戴上孩子面具，穿着儿童服装，身材短小，真像乳臭未干的小娃娃。看了这舞蹈，剧场中观众的情绪非常活跃。关于演员是小孩还是成人的问题，观众争论不休，直到她们脱下假面具，观众才知道原来都是由一些成人扮演的。
    “草原上的热巴”具有强烈的藏族人民的风格，从一开始它就把观众紧紧地吸引住了。鲜艳的布景使人有立体景物的感觉，不禁要联想到“天苍苍，野茫茫，风吹草低见牛羊”的壮丽的风光。这个舞蹈变化多而充满活力，跳、滚、翻、腾，转换优美，场面热烈，加上抒情的曲调和十二名藏族姑娘的轻盈起舞，节奏明快，姿态优美。整个节目扣人心弦，充分表现了解放后藏族艺人在辽阔的草原上歌唱幸福生活的欢乐心情。
    “各族人民庆丰收”更赢得了观众热烈的喝彩和掌声。这个舞蹈反映了我国各族人民在共产党和毛主席领导下成立了人民公社，通过轰轰烈烈大跃进的群众运动，不仅工农业生产获得了空前的丰收，而且也更进一步促进了各族人民之间的友谊和大团结。在人们庆祝大丰收的时候，热闹的游艺节目来了。你看，骏马奔驰，拖拉机开动，有歌有舞，气氛异常热烈。乐曲中非常巧妙地穿插了具有中国各民族特色的旋律和舞曲的节奏，使整个舞蹈充满了浓厚的生活气息，把那种获得丰收的无限欢乐的感情，强烈地转达给观众。
    中国歌舞对缅甸友人具有巨大的魅力。从1月25日到31日的五次演出中，很多人连续看了三、四次。26、27日夜晚，天降细雨，每场观众仍达五千人左右，有的撑着雨伞观看，没有雨伞的衣服湿透了也不肯中途退场。他们对中国艺术家的演技给予极高的评价。缅甸副总理吴伦博赞不绝口地说：“演得太好了！”他向文化部吴漆东部长建议，要很好地组织缅甸艺术家们学习中国的舞蹈艺术。他说，他年青时曾看过中国的舞蹈，但那时的演员都是老头和小孩子，动作很慢，与现在生动活泼优美的舞姿大不相同。最高法院首席法官吴敏登夫妇说，节目动人，音乐幽雅，舞蹈步伐轻快，而且全都是他们从来没有看过的新节目。
    缅甸艺术学校校长吴貌貌和著名音乐家吴巴丹说，中国民族歌舞团所演出的节目是具有另一种吸引人的独特风格，他们并且认为中国民族艺术的发展速度实在惊人。吴貌貌说，中国歌舞团的演出，给观众留下了“美”与“乐”的感受。
    许多缅甸朋友对歌舞团的几位女团员所表演的缅甸舞蹈“瓦城的花朵”和维吾尔族女歌唱家阿衣木尼沙演唱的缅甸歌曲“海鸥”感到特别的亲切和赞赏。阿衣木尼沙的“海鸥”演唱两次，谢幕达四次之多，这在缅甸的演出历史上还是第一次。有些观众说，她表情很好，唱出了缅甸的情调。她的歌声与观众的感情交织在一起，使整个剧场浸沉在深厚的友情中。而且缅甸朋友对于她刚到一两天就学会了缅甸歌，无不钦佩她的才智。缅甸电影名演员吴吞威说：“外国人唱缅甸歌唱得这样好，真是罕见。”
    中国民族歌舞团应仰光市民的热烈请求，在2月1、2两日续演了两场，现在已离仰光去毛淡棉、东枝和曼德勒等地与更多的缅甸朋友见面。我们相信，通过这次友好演出，将会进一步加深中缅两国人民真挚的“胞波”情谊。
