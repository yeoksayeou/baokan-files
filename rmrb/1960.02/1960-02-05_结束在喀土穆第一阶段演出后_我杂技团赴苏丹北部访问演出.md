The Chinese Acrobatic Troupe gave eight days of performances to more than 15,000 spectators in Khartoum, receiving high praise and admiration from the audience. Local newspapers also published feature articles and photos introducing and commenting on the Chinese acrobats.

The Sudanese newspaper "Today's News" published an article entitled "The Great Chinese Acrobatic Art Makes the Audience Burst with Joy," writing that the performances of the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe are wonderful, filled with graceful and bold martial arts, brilliantly displaying artistic color, making us laugh from the bottom of our hearts, while also capturing our emotions.

The "Al-Rai al-Aam" wrote that the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe demonstrated art, courage, and the wisdom accumulated by the Chinese people through many generations to the Sudanese people through their performances. It emphasized that although Chinese acrobatics has a history of one thousand years, it has only been fully developed since the founding of New China because the People's Government spares no effort to develop art and culture.

"Al-Saraha" and "The Nile Gazette" also welcomed the performance visit of the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe, as it strengthened the cultural and friendly relations between the two countries.
