    Hekou Commune Turns Poor Team into Rich Team by Making it a Commune-Run Direct Team and Developing Animal Husbandry
    (Our Report) The Hekou People's Commune in Xundian County, Yunnan Province, has created an important experience in helping poor teams catch up with rich teams. It designated the poorest Yihai Production Team as a directly managed livestock team of the commune. Relying on the commune's support in funds, breeding stock, and tools, the team rapidly developed animal husbandry and transformed itself into a rich team. At the same time, it solved the problems of labor and feed base required for livestock breeding at the commune level. Without having to start from scratch, the commune was able to raise livestock on a large scale. In this way, the development of animal husbandry at the commune level increased the accumulation of the commune and expanded the proportion of the commune's ownership. The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that this is a good experience worth promoting.
    The Yihai Production Team of Hekou Commune had thin and barren soil, and was frequently hit by floods and droughts. At the time of liberation, the average yield per mu was only over 70 jin of grain. Although production has increased year by year since liberation, the increase has not been large, and the foundation was weak, so they relied on state relief every year. At the beginning of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the district committee was determined to help them change their backward situation. When a drought occurred here, the district committee set up the drought resistance headquarters in Yihai Village, and transferred more than 150 people and 80 head of cattle from other places to support them. The state also loaned them 7,000 yuan to buy a water pump. With the support of all parties, the masses of the whole village worked hard day and night, overcame the drought, and also applied 80 dan of sod fertilizer to each mu of land. Although grain production increased by 43% this year, it still did not solve all the problems, and they still owed the state more than 3,000 yuan in loans. After the establishment of the commune, the commune party committee analyzed the reasons why the team could not turn over year after year: there were few livestock, little stable manure, and a shortage of labor. By 1958, the entire team had only 41 pigs and 59 cattle. However, there are mountains, water, slopes, and dams here, and the conditions for developing animal husbandry are very good. The commune believed that in order to completely turn this team over and change from poor to rich, it could only rely on the development of animal husbandry.
    At this time, the commune also decided to develop the commune's ownership economy and needed to find a production team as a directly affiliated livestock team. Therefore, after obtaining the consent of the Yihai Production Team, the commune changed this team into a directly managed livestock team of the commune. The masses were also very happy about this. Then, the commune transferred all the more than 100 head of cattle owned by the commune to this team to raise and assisted them in vigorously developing pig raising. These cattle still belonged to the commune, but were managed and used by the production team, so the fertilizer also belonged to the production team. In addition to allocating 8,000 jin of concentrated feed to this production team in installments, the commune made full use of the production team's original livestock facilities and set up a livestock farm. Due to the careful and attentive feeding and grazing of the members, the livestock developed rapidly. In the past year, the number of cattle increased from 165 to 249, and the number of pigs also increased from 41 to 74. From the sale of 21 head of beef cattle and 16 fat pigs, the commune received more than 2,000 yuan in cash, which increased the commune's income. The Yihai Production Team also completely turned over in production. The number of cattle that the entire team could use increased from 18 to 186. The team replaced human digging with plowing with cattle, replaced human carrying with ox carts, and replaced artificial miscellaneous fertilizer with stable manure. Although this production team with only 28 households extracted 11 laborers to raise livestock, the accumulation of fertilizer alone reduced 19 laborers compared to previous years, and the saved labor was used to strengthen field management. Last year, the team applied more than 80 dan of high-quality stable manure to each mu of land, and the rice and corn were hoeed two to four times. This ensured that the fields were adequately watered and fertilized, so that the yield per unit area soared from 160 jin to more than 320 jin, and the total grain output of the entire team also increased from 110,000 jin to more than 227,000 jin, more than doubling in one year, with an average of more than 1,500 jin of grain per person. Livestock has also developed greatly. In one year, the number of cattle increased by 52%, and the number of pigs also increased by 80%, achieving a double harvest of grain and livestock.
    In this way, the Yihai Production Team changed the situation of relying on state relief for many years, and also paid public grain to the state for the first time and sold surplus grain. After leaving enough grain, seeds, and feed for the whole year, the team still had more than 20,000 jin of reserve grain, with an average surplus of 700 jin per household. In addition to repaying the loans of previous years, the team also increased public accumulation by 3,000 yuan. All 28 households in the team had deposits in the bank, thus basically removing the label of a poor team.

### 河口公社把穷队作为公社直属队  发展畜牧业由穷队变成富队

    河口公社把穷队作为公社直属队
    发展畜牧业由穷队变成富队
    本报讯　云南省寻甸县河口人民公社创造了一项使穷队赶上富队的重要经验，把最穷的以海生产队作为公社的直属畜牧队，使这个穷队依靠公社在资金、母畜和工具等方面的扶持，迅速发展了畜牧业，从而一跃变成了富队；同时解决了公社一级饲养牲畜所需的劳动力和饲料基地等问题，不必另起炉灶，就可大养牲畜；这样，公社一级畜牧业的发展，增加了公社的积累，又扩大了公社所有制的比重。中共云南省委认为，这是一个值得推广的好经验。
    河口公社以海生产队，土层薄瘠，水旱灾害频繁，解放时平均每亩才产粮食七十多斤。解放以来虽然年年增产，但增产不大，底子又薄，所以年年靠国家救济。1958年大跃进开始时，区委会下决心要帮助他们改变落后面貌。当这里发生旱象时，区委会就把抗旱指挥部设在以海村，从其它地方抽调了一百五十多人和八十条耕牛前来支援。国家又贷款七千元给他们买了一部抽水机。全村群众在各方支援下日夜苦战，战胜了干旱，还给每亩地施了八十担草皮肥，这一年粮食虽然增产了43％，但还是没有全部解决问题，而且仍然欠着国家三千多元贷款。公社成立后，公社党委分析这个队年年翻不上去的原因是：牲畜少、厩肥少、劳动力紧张，到1958年全队只有四十一头猪和五十九头牛。但这里有山有水、有坡有坝，发展畜牧业的条件很好，公社认为要使这个队彻底翻身，由穷变富，只有依靠发展畜牧业。
    这时，公社也决定要发展公社所有制的经济，需要找一个生产队作为畜牧业直属队。于是，公社在征得以海生产队的同意后，把这个队改为公社的直属畜牧队。群众对此也十分高兴。接着，公社就把社一级所有的一百多头耕牛都调到这个队饲养并辅助他们大力发展养猪，这些耕牛仍归公社所有，但由生产队管理和使用，所以肥料也归生产队所有。这样公社除分期拨给这个生产队八千斤精饲料以外，便充分利用了生产队原有的畜厩设备，办起了畜牧场。由于社员饲养放牧得周到细心，牲畜发展很快。一年来，耕牛由一百六十五头繁殖到二百四十九头，猪也由四十一头发展到七十四头，从出卖的二十一条菜牛和十六头肥猪中，公社收入现金二千多元，增加了公社的收入。以海生产队也在生产上彻底翻了一个身，全队能供使役的牛由十八头增加到一百八十六头，普遍用牛犁地代替了人挖地，用牛车代替了人背人挑，用畜厩肥代替了人工积杂肥。这个只有二十八户的生产队，虽抽出十一个劳动力饲养牲畜，但光是积肥一项，就比往年减少了十九个劳动力，利用节省的劳动力加强了田间管理。去年，全队平均每亩土地施了八十多担优质厩肥，稻谷和包谷普遍薅锄了二至四道。保证了田地水饱肥足，使单位面积由一百六十斤猛增到三百二十多斤，全队粮食总产量也由十一万斤增加到二十二万七千多斤，一年就增产一倍多，平均每人有粮一千五百多斤。牲畜也有很大发展，一年中耕牛增长了52％，生猪也增长了80％，获得了粮畜双丰收。
    这样，以海生产队一下改变了历年依靠国家救济的状况，还第一次向国家缴纳了公粮，出售了余粮。全队除留足了全年所需的口粮、籽种和饲料外，还剩下两万多斤储备粮，平均每户有余粮七百斤。队里除还清了历年的贷款以外，还增加了公共积累三千元，全队二十八户家家在银行存了款，从而基本上摘掉了穷队的帽子。
