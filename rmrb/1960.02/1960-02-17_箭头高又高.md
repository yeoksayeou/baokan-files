    The Arrow is High, High, High
    I draw a record chart, the arrow is high, high, high,
    I wonder what the reason is? Let’s take a close look.
    Technical performance competitions, are being carried out everywhere,
    You chase me and I catch up, high quality and high yield.

    箭头高又高
    我画记录表，箭头高又高，
    不知啥原因？仔细瞧一瞧。
    技术表演赛，处处大开展，
    你追我也赶，优质又高产。
            辽阳纺织厂工人
