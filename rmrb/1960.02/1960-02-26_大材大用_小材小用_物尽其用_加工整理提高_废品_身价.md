Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Telegram: The Changsha Waste Product Purchasing Company in Hunan Province has adopted the method of running its own processing factories and organizing social forces to process waste products vigorously. This has enabled the business operation to develop from purchasing and selling waste products to a combination of purchasing, processing, and supplying, better supporting industrial and agricultural production.

In January of this year, the total value of waste products processed by the company's eleven processing factories reached 576,000 yuan, including 1,650 bolts of regenerated cloth, 2,100 flatbed cart tires, 2,330 rubber shoe soles, 55,000 sets of screws, 500 sets of bearings, and many other materials that, after processing and sorting, were supplied to industrial and agricultural departments and the market.

The company also organized social forces to process waste products and sought support from other factories. Combining with street production, they entrusted street residents with processing through residents' committees; combining with work-study programs, they organized students to do some auxiliary processing and sorting work during holidays and free time. At the same time, they signed contracts with factories such as Xinhua Machinery Factory, Blind Welfare Cotton Ginning Factory, Changsha Smelting Plant, and Hardware Products Factory to supply waste products for processing by these units.

In processing, they adhered to the principle of "making the best use of big timber, making the best use of small timber, and making the best use of all usable materials" to increase social wealth.

    大材大用　小材小用　物尽其用
    加工整理提高“废品”身价
    据新华社长沙电　湖南省长沙市废品采购公司采取自办加工厂和组织社会力量加工的办法，大力加工废品，使业务经营由收购废品出售废品，发展为收购、加工、供应相结合，更好地支援了工农业生产。
    今年1月份，这个公司的十一个加工厂加工废品总值共达五十七万六千元，其中有再生布一千六百五十匹，板车胶带二千一百条，胶鞋底二千三百三十支，螺丝五万五千套，轴承五百套，还有许多其他物资经过加工整理，供给了工、农业部门和供应了市场。
    这个公司还组织社会力量加工，并争取其他工厂的支援。他们结合街道生产，通过居民委员会委托街道居民加工；结合勤工俭学，组织学生利用假日和空闲时间作一些辅助性的加工和整理工作。同时，又与新华机械厂、盲人福利弹棉厂、长沙冶炼厂、五金制品厂等工厂签订合同，供给废品，由这些单位加工。
    在加工中，他们坚持了“大材大用、小材小用，凡是可用的材料尽量利用”的原则，以增加社会财富。
