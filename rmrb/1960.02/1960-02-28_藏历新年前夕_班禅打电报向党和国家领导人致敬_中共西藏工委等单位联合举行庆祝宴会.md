Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, February 27th. On the eve of the Tibetan New Year of the Iron Rat, Panchen Erdeni, Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, sent a telegram to pay respects to Party and state leaders. The telegram is as follows:

Respected Chairman Mao,
      Chairman Liu,
      Chairman Zhu,
      Premier Zhou,

    As the Tibetan New Year of the Iron Rat approaches, please allow me, in my own name and on behalf of the Tibetan monks and laypeople, to extend my most heartfelt New Year greetings to our beloved great leader Chairman Mao, Chairman Liu, Chairman Zhu, Premier Zhou, and other central leaders of the people of all ethnic groups in our country!

    The vast number of Tibetan monks and laypeople, together with the people of the whole country, after joyfully celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland, a festival for all the people, are now sending off the historically significant and glorious Tibetan Year of the Earth Pig with unparalleled excitement, and celebrating the arrival of a brighter New Year.

    In the past year, truly earth-shaking great changes have taken place in Tibet. With the rapid suppression of the counter-revolutionary armed rebellion launched by the reactionary upper strata group in Tibet to split the motherland's unity and undermine national unity, and with the great victory of the democratic reform movement, the Tibetan people have transformed from slaves in a living hell to masters of their own destiny. Under the wise leadership of the Party and our beloved Chairman Mao, and with the strong support of the people of all fraternal ethnic groups across the country, the Tibetan people have unswervingly embarked on the broad road of democracy and socialism. As the Tibetan people celebrate the traditional Tibetan New Year, they sing with boundless gratitude and excitement: Glory to the great savior of the people of all ethnic groups in our country, the Communist Party of China! Glory to the beloved great leader of the people of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao! Glory to the people of all ethnic groups in the big family of the motherland who are united, friendly, mutually supportive, and developing together! Glory to the Tibetan people who are bravely advancing along the road of democracy and socialism!

    I wish the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland greater achievements in socialist construction under the glorious illumination of the General Line! I wish the Tibetan people even greater victories in the New Year!

    I wish our beloved Chairman Mao a long life. I wish Chairman Liu, Chairman Zhu, and Premier Zhou eternal good health.
