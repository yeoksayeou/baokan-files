Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd: Over 16,000 Young Pioneers from the capital jubilantly gathered at the Great Hall of the People on February 1st to hold a youth "Long Live the Three Red Banners" activity and get-together. At the meeting, the children sang with abandon: We are red scarves today, and tomorrow we will be red flag bearers of socialism and communism. We will always follow the Party and Chairman Mao.

Since October of last year, Young Pioneers across the country have universally launched an educational campaign of "Long Live the Three Red Banners" focused on the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and love for the People's Communes. Hundreds of thousands of Young Pioneers have visited factories and people's communes, interviewed red banner bearers, met with advanced producers and model workers, and organized red youth investigation teams. Exhibitions have been held. Through these activities, the vast number of Young Pioneers have received profound socialist education.

Tan Zhenlin, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, attended the meeting and joined the children in the get-together. Also participating were responsible persons from the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the All-China Women's Federation, red banner bearers from the capital's production and construction front, scientists and writers from the capital, and Young Pioneer instructors. They wished the children would always listen to Chairman Mao's words: "Study hard and make progress every day."

On February 1st, the solemn Great Hall of the People was filled with the joyful songs and laughter of the children. At 2:30 p.m., the get-together began. Tang Jingsheng, a twelve-year-old Little Chairman, said in his speech: "We Young Pioneers in the capital, listening to the Party's words, have vigorously launched the ‘Long Live the Three Red Banners’ campaign. The Party and Chairman Mao put forward the General Line and led the people of the whole country to realize the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes. We resolutely support the Three Red Banners – we resolutely support the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao! We are all determined to carry out the 'Long Live the Three Red Banners' campaign even better." After the Little Chairman's speech, the children unanimously shouted: "Long live the General Line! Long live the Great Leap Forward! Long live the People's Communes!"

Then, one hundred young Pioneers, both boys and girls, collectively recited the poem "Today We Are Red Scarves, Tomorrow We Are Red Flag Bearers!" in front of dozens of huge red flags. The poem said: "Sunflowers face the sun, Young Pioneers always follow the Party." "On the beautiful and vast land of our motherland, we must build a communist paradise!" Three hundred red scarves also took to the stage and sang in unison: "Long Live the Three Red Banners," "How Good Our Life Is," "Mountain Songs Sing to the Blue Sky," and "Tomorrow We Will Be Red Flag Bearers." The songs expressed their bravery and the infinitely beautiful future of the motherland.

At this time, various recreational activities began simultaneously upstairs and downstairs in various bright halls. Immersed in the joy of the festival, the red scarves enjoyed good songs, dances, and amusing comic dialogues performed by uncles, aunts, older brothers, and older sisters from various art troupes in the capital, watched movies, puppet shows, and table tennis exhibition matches by the national table tennis team. Various science and technology games prepared by students from Peking University deeply attracted the children's interest. After talking to the "robot," the children enthusiastically played science and technology games such as "Lunar Travel," "Precision Parachuting," and "Magnetic Exploration." When the children launched the rocket to the moon, they rushed to receive the winners' prizes. During the more than two hours of get-together activities, the Great Hall of the People was filled with youthful laughter.

This get-together was jointly sponsored by the China Youth Daily, the New Youth Daily, and the Beijing Children's Palace.

    首都一万六千少先队员大联欢
    孩子们纵情高唱：我们今天是红领巾，明天要当社会主义和共产主义的红旗手，我们要永远跟着党和毛主席。
    新华社2日讯　首都一万六千多名少先队员，1日兴高采烈地聚集在人民大会堂举行少年“三面红旗万万岁”活动联欢会。孩子们在会上纵情地高唱：我们今天是红领巾，明天要当社会主义和共产主义的红旗手，我们要永远跟着党和毛主席。
    从去年10月以来，全国少年先锋队员普遍展开了总路线、大跃进、热爱人民公社的“三面红旗万万岁”的教育活动。成千上万的少先队员参观了工厂、人民公社，访问了红旗手，同先进生产者和劳动模范会见，组织了红色少年调查团。举办了展览会。通过这些活动，广大少先队员受到深刻的社会主义教育。
    中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理谭震林到会和孩子们一起联欢。一起联欢的还有共青团中央、全国妇联的负责人，首都生产建设战线上的红旗手，首都的科学家、作家以及少年先锋队辅导员等。他们祝孩子们永远听毛主席的话：“好好学习，天天向上”。
    1日，庄严的人民大会堂里，充满了孩子们的欢乐的歌声和笑声。下午二时半，联欢会开始，十二岁的小主席唐景生讲话说：“我们首都少先队员，听党的话，轰轰烈烈地开展了‘三面红旗万万岁’的活动。党和毛主席提出了总路线，领导全国人民实现了大跃进和人民公社化。我们坚决拥护三面红旗——我们坚决拥护党中央和毛主席！我们都有决心要把‘三面红旗万万岁’的活动开展得更好。”孩子们在小主席讲话以后，一致高呼：“总路线万岁！大跃进万岁！人民公社万岁！”
    接着，一百名男女少先队员在数十面巨大的红旗前面，集体朗诵诗：“今天是红领巾，明天是红旗手！”诗中说道：“向日葵朵朵向太阳，少先队员永远跟着党。”“在祖国美丽辽阔的土地上，我们一定要建立起共产主义的天堂！”三百名红领巾也登上舞台齐声高唱：“三面红旗万万岁”、“我们的生活多么好”、“山歌向着青天唱”和“明天要当红旗手”等歌子，歌声唱出了他们的勇敢，唱出了祖国无限美好的未来。
    这时，楼上楼下，各个明亮的大厅里，同时开始了各种游艺活动。沉浸在节日欢乐中的红领巾们，有的欣赏首都各艺术团体的伯伯、叔叔、姐姐、哥哥们演出的好歌、好舞和逗人欢乐的相声，有的观看电影、木偶戏和国家乒乓球队的乒乓球表演赛。北京大学的学生准备的各种科学技术游戏深深吸引孩子们的兴趣。孩子们和“机器人”谈话以后，又兴致勃勃地玩“月球旅行”“定点跳伞”、“磁力探矿”等科学技术游戏。当孩子们把火箭射到月球时，他们便兴冲冲地去领取优胜者的奖品。在两个多小时的联欢活动中，人民大会堂里充满着一片青春的欢笑声。
    这个联欢会是由中国少年报社、新少年报社和北京市少年宫联合举办的。
