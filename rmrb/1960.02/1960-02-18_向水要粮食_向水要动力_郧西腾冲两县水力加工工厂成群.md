Take Grain from Water, Take Power from Water
Yunxi and Tengchong Counties Have Clusters of Hydraulic Processing Factories

(Our dispatch) Yunxi County, Hubei Province, using indigenous methods, has built a series of hydraulic processing facilities along irrigation canals. Yunxi is mountainous, with thirty-six rivers and over three hundred mountain gullies with year-round water flow. These rivers and gullies are spread throughout the county. Before liberation, there were few water conservancy facilities, and the paddy field area was only over 10,000 mu. After years of construction since liberation, the county has a total of more than 7,700 canals of various sizes, and the paddy field area has expanded to more than 180,000 mu; the various hydraulic processing factories built using the canals are increasing day by day. At present, the county's hydraulic processing plants have developed to more than 440, totaling 1,200 horsepower. These factories can husk rice, mill rice, grind flour, gin cotton, press oil, saw wood, generate electricity, etc. In many places, one or twenty hydraulic processing factories have been built on one canal, forming a continuous hydraulic processing facility. The commune members happily sing: "In the past, pushing the millstone was like being an ox, now the grain goes in and the rice comes out." The urban and suburban areas and the Ma'an Commune have basically eliminated the use of human and animal power for rice and flour milling, and have realized the automation of hydraulic processing in grain, cotton, and oil. This not only saves a large amount of labor but also frees people from heavy physical labor. According to incomplete statistics, the county saves more than one million workdays and more than 2,400 cattle a year.

The main experiences of Yunxi County in vigorously developing the hydraulic automatic processing industry are: First, adhere to adapting to local conditions and adapting to water conditions, and install different numbers of processing tools according to the water power. In places with large flow and large drop, more processing tools can be installed (i.e., "one driving several"); in places with small flow and small drop, fewer processing tools can be installed. Generally speaking, it takes more than 1.5 horsepower to drive one tool. Second, comprehensively utilize water for multiple purposes. That is, on a canal or river, select places with higher terrain, block the water section by section, set up factories section by section, and after the water flows through, it still flows into the canal or nearby fields, so that every drop of water can play a role. For example, the Tianhui Canal, which is more than eighty li long, not only irrigates more than 8,000 mu of fields and raises more than 50,000 fish, but also has thirty-one hydraulic processing factories built along the canal, which can generate electricity (60 kilowatts installed), press oil, saw wood, and mill rice. The Minsheng Canal and other five main canals and more than forty branch canals in the urban and suburban communes not only irrigate more than 11,000 mu of farmland but also have fifty-one hydraulic processing factories built along the canals, forming a water conservancy network that combines automated irrigation and automated processing. Third, adhere to the policy of mainly using indigenous methods and combining indigenous and foreign methods. Here, the various tools for hydraulic processing are all transformed from the original mills, grinders, rice hullers, windmills, etc. The waterwheels, various gears, pillars, and frames used as power tools are all made of wood. Because materials are obtained locally and the technical operation is simple, the continuous hydraulic processing clusters have rapidly formed a mass movement in Yunxi County.

Yunxi County's continuous hydraulic processing facilities are the result of a vigorous mass movement and the product of consistently adhering to the leadership of the Party. The specific methods are to highlight model workers, establish red banners, and carry out large-scale visits, exchanges, publicity, and promotion movements. In the summer of 1958, the Yunxi County Party Committee discovered that Fu Zhengguo, a member of the Chenfeng Production Team (then the Chenfeng Agricultural Cooperative) of the Anjia Commune, had created automated rice and flour processing, which aroused great attention. It successively issued two decisions to mobilize the people of the county to learn from Fu Zhengguo and catch up with Fu Zhengguo. At the same time, it used newspapers, radio, and other means to vigorously publicize and promote it, and also organized a series of on-site meetings to promote Fu Zhengguo's experience, gradually forming a mass movement, so that hydraulic processing automation expanded from a few to many and from some areas to all parts of the county.

(Our dispatch) On the crisscrossing rivers along the Lancang River and Daying River in Tengchong County, Yunnan Province, one hundred and four hydropower stations have been built, using water turbines as power to drive more than two hundred and ten rice milling machines, flour milling machines, sugar pressing machines, linkage grain and wheat threshers, pulping machines, sawing machines, crushers, blowers and other agricultural and sideline product processing machinery, which has solved the difficulty of insufficient labor in the continuous leap forward of industrial and agricultural production.

Tengchong County has extremely rich water resources. In the past, in addition to irrigating farmland, they were not well utilized. After communization, with the rapid development of agricultural production and commune industry, the contradiction between the existing labor force and the actual needs of industrial and agricultural production became increasingly prominent. After repeated deliberations and discussions, the county party committee decided to focus on "water." Therefore, it proposed to the people of the county: "Force rivers to obey orders, take labor from water, build a hundred hydropower stations, and add 24,000 new labors." The county party secretary took the lead and formed a survey team to conduct a general survey of the county's water resources, and made a plan to build one hundred and four new hydropower stations. After this exciting news spread, the people of the county were all overjoyed, and the communes and teams took the initiative to raise funds and prepare materials, and they all asked to build hydropower stations.

At the beginning of the action, there was only one master in the county who understood this technology. The masses overcame this difficulty with the great ambition to learn if they didn't know how. More than fifty people from various factories, mines, and schools formed the first installation team, taking the Nianfangba Station of Heshun Commune as a pilot, learning while doing. In this way, within a year, a technical team with more than one hundred and ten people, one thousand five hundred and ten installers, and three hundred and sixty-seven operators of various processing machinery were trained. A large amount of funds and raw materials used in the construction of the station were all raised by the masses themselves. The Baiguo Hydropower Station in Jietou Commune needed 200 cubic meters of stone, and the masses automatically took out stone slabs. In order to raise funds, the communes and teams developed various sideline businesses to accumulate funds while ensuring agricultural production.

These one hundred and four hydropower stations have added 4,477 horsepower to the county, which is more than eleven times the total power of the county, and can replace 25,600 laborers. Among them, seven hydropower stations have been equipped with generators, with a power generation capacity of 161 kilowatts, which is equivalent to the total power of the county. After installing various processing machinery using these powers, the county basically realized the mechanization of agricultural and sideline product processing. The linkage grain and wheat threshing machine driven by the hydropower station, put into autumn harvest and autumn planting, one machine is operated by four people, three people transport the grain, and one day can thresh more than 12,000 jin, the work efficiency is three times higher than that of the foot-operated threshing machine, and five times higher than manual threshing.

All one hundred and four hydropower stations in the county are equipped with rice milling and flour milling machines. Each rice milling machine can process 20,000 jin of grain a day, and the work efficiency is more than fifteen times higher than that of water milling. Now the county's food rice processing is mechanized, and this one item alone saves 16,000 labors. In the sugarcane and oil crop producing areas, sugar pressing and oil pressing machines are equipped. This year, 63% of the county's sugarcane area can be processed by machine pressing at hydropower stations. The one hundred and four hydropower processing networks that have been built in the county have been put into production in December last year. In just one month, they have saved 545,700 workdays.

    向水要粮食　向水要动力
    郧西腾冲两县水力加工工厂成群
    本报讯　湖北郧西县利用土办法，在灌溉渠道上建成了一条龙式的水力加工设施。郧西多山，全县大小河流三十六条，常年流水的山沟有三百多条。这些河流和山沟遍布全县，解放前很少水利设施，水田面积只有一万多亩。解放后经过多年来的建设，全县共有大小渠道七千七百多条，水田面积扩大到十八万多亩；利用渠道兴建的各种水力加工工厂与日俱增。目前，全县水力加工厂已发展到四百四十多处，共一千二百马力。这些工厂可以砻谷、碾米、磨面、轧花、榨油、锯木、发电等。不少地方在一条水渠上建有一、二十座水力加工厂，形成了一条龙式的水力加工设施。社员们高兴地唱道：“过去推磨杠，好像牛一样，现在谷一上，米就往下放。”城郊、马鞍等公社已经基本上消灭了人畜力碾米磨面，实现了粮、棉、油等方面水力加工自动化。这样，不仅节省了大批的劳动力，而且使人们摆脱了繁重的体力劳动。据不完全统计，全县一年中因此节省一百多万个劳动日和二千四百多头牛。
    郧西县大搞水力自动加工业的主要经验是：第一，坚持因地制宜和因水制宜，根据水力大小，架设不同数量的加工工具。流量大、落差大的地方就可以多架加工工具；
  （即“一打几带”）流量小、落差小的地方就少架加工工具。一般说来，带动一件工具，需要有一点五马力以上的动力。第二，综合利用，一水多用。就是在一条渠或一条河上，选择地形较高的地方，节节堵水，节节设厂，水流过之后，仍流入本渠或附近田间，使每一滴水都发挥作用。例如，长达八十多里的天惠渠，不仅灌田八千多亩，养鱼五万多尾，而且沿渠建了三十一座水力加工工厂，可以发电（装机六十瓩）、榨油、锯木、碾米。城郊公社民生渠等五条干渠，四十多条支渠，不仅灌溉一万一千多亩农田，沿渠还兴建了五十一处水力加工工厂，构成了一个灌溉自流化和加工自动化相结合的水利网。第三，坚持以土为主、土洋结合的方针。在这里水力加工的各种工具，都是利用原来的磨、碾、砻子、风车等改装的，作为动力工具的水轮和各种齿轮以及柱子、架子，也全是木头做成的。由于就地取材，技术操作简便，因此，一条龙式的水力加工群，便迅速地在郧西县形成群众性运动。
    郧西县一条龙式的水力加工设施是大搞群众运动的结果，是自始至终坚持党的领导的产物。具体作法是，突出标兵，树立红旗，开展大参观、大交流、大宣传、大推广运动。1958年夏天，郧西县委发现安家公社成丰生产队（当时是成丰农业社）社员傅正国创造米面加工自动化以后，引起高度重视，先后发出两次决定，动员全县人民学傅正国，赶傅正国。同时，利用报纸、广播等大力宣传和推广，还组织了一连串的现场会议，推广傅正国的经验，逐步形成了群众运动，使水力加工自动化由少到多，由部分地区扩展到全县各地。
    本报讯　云南腾冲县陇川江、大盈江两岸纵横交错的河流上，建起了一百零四座水力站，以水轮机为动力，带动了二百一十多部碾米机、磨面机、榨糖机、联动式谷麦脱粒机、打浆机、锯木机、破碎机、鼓风机等农副产品加工机械，解决了工农业生产连续跃进当中劳力不足的困难。
    腾冲县的水力资源极其丰富。过去，除了灌溉农田以外，没有很好利用起来。公社化后，随着农业生产和公社工业的飞跃发展，现有劳力和工农业生产实际需要之间的矛盾越来越突出。县委经过多次的酝酿讨论，决定在“水”上打主意。于是向全县人民提出了：“迫令江川听使唤，向水要出劳动力，建设百个水电站，新增劳力二万四”的号召。由县委书记挂帅，组成了勘测队，对全县水力资源进行普查，并作出了新建一百零四个水力站的规划。这个振奋人心的消息传出后，全县人民莫不欢欣鼓舞，社社队队主动筹资备料，纷纷要求建立水力站。
    刚开始行动的时候，全县懂得这方面技术的师傅只有一人。群众抱着不会就学的大志，战胜了这一难关。来自各厂矿、学校的五十多人，成立了第一支安装队，以和顺公社碾房坝站为试点，边做边学。就这样，一年之间培养出了一支拥有一百一十多人的技术队伍和一千五百一十个安装工、三百六十七个各种加工机械的操作手。在建站中所用的大批资金和原材料，都是群众自己筹集的。界头公社白果水力站需要石料二百个立方，群众自动把石板拿出来。为了筹集资金，社社队队在保证农业生产的同时，开展各种副业来积累资金。
    这一百零四个水力站，给全县增加了四千四百七十七马力的动力，超过原来县内全部动力总和的十一倍，可以代替二万五千六百个劳动力。其中有七个水力站已经安装了发电机，发电能力一百六十一瓩，相当于全县原来电力的总和。利用这些动力安装了各种加工机械后，全县基本实现了农副产品加工机械化。由水力站带动的联动式谷麦脱粒机，投入秋收秋种后，一部机器四人操作，三人运送谷子，一天脱粒一万二千多斤，工效比脚踏打谷机提高了三倍，比人工打谷提高了五倍。
    全县一百零四个水力站，都配上了碾米、磨面机，每台碾米机一天可处理两万斤谷子，工效比水碾水碓提高了十五倍以上。现在全县食米加工做到机械化，单这一项，就节约了一万六千个劳动力。在甘蔗、油料作物的产区，都配上了榨糖机、榨油机，今年全县甘蔗面积的63％都可用水力站的机榨处理。全县已建成的一百零四个水力动力加工网，自去年12月份全部投入生产以来，仅一个月时间内，就节约了五十四万五千七百个劳动日。
