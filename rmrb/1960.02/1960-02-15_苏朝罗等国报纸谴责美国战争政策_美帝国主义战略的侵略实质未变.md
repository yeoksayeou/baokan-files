Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 13th. The Soviet "Naval Gazette" published a commentary on the 13th, exposing the war policy of U.S. imperialism.

The commentary stated that the foreign policy of U.S. imperialism is to establish world domination, which has given rise to their global aggressive war strategy. However, the world situation is changing rapidly. A major blow to U.S. imperialism was the loss of its atomic monopoly. They have also fallen behind in rocket technology. Now, many military issues must be resolved in new ways. Strategic air power is outdated and cannot compete with rockets. The network of foreign military bases has also lost its original significance. The myth of U.S. territory being invulnerable has been shattered. Thus, the policy of strength and strategy of the U.S. adventurers have gone bankrupt.

The commentary pointed out that the path of peace is not to the liking of the U.S. imperialists. They have not changed the aggressive essence of their military strategy, but have tried every possible way to put a new face on their military strategy. Theories such as "limited war," "local war," and "small war" have been created.

The commentary pointed out that the theory of "limited war" is a disguise and cover for imperialism's preparation for a global war. The proponents of nuclear war put forward theories such as "limited war" in an attempt to replace substance with abstract words in order to deceive the working masses and instill in them the idea that "limited war" and "local war" will not lead to a new world war.

The commentary pointed out that the bourgeois strategists put forward various concepts of small-scale wars in the hope of suppressing, by means of piecemeal attacks, the people who have embarked on the road of independent development, and even want to invade some socialist countries.

It is very clear that the so-called "limited war" does not mean that imperialism refuses to prepare for a new world war. The theory of all-out nuclear war has not been abandoned. However, the Pentagon deceives the people for fear of being punished.

The commentary concluded by saying that no lies can help U.S. imperialism deceive world public opinion. The people of the world have realized that in the era of rocket weapons and nuclear weapons, a limited war is in danger of turning into an all-out atomic war.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 13th. The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary today, condemning the U.S. imperialists for transporting new-style missiles into South Korea, conducting large-scale military exercises in South Korea, and U.S. senior military officers constantly going to South Korea to advocate war preparations and other provocative acts.

The commentary said, "The U.S. imperialists' war preparations in South Korea not only deteriorated the situation in Korea, but also became a threat to peace and security in the Far East."

The commentary pointed out, "The U.S. imperialists' conspiracy in South Korea more nakedly exposed the ugly nature of the Washington authorities, who, while chanting 'peace,' are actually pursuing 'cold war' frantically expanding armaments and preparing for war under the guise of peace." The commentary said that no provocation by the U.S. imperialists can intimidate the Korean people, nor can it frustrate the anti-U.S. and anti-Syngman Rhee struggle of the South Korean people. "If the U.S. imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique dare to risk igniting the flames of a new war, it will inevitably end in their own tragic demise. Today, the unity of the Korean people is stronger than ever, and they have great allies. The U.S. imperialists must immediately withdraw all war tools, including atomic and missile weapons, from South Korea; withdraw and abolish U.S. troops and U.S. military bases in all regions of Asia. This is the only legitimate way to consolidate peace in Korea, promote a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, and maintain and consolidate peace in the Far East."

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, February 10th. The "Free Romania" newspaper published a commentary on the 10th, condemning U.S. generals and politicians for continuing to clamor for arms expansion and war preparation.

The commentary said that on the eve of the summit meeting, U.S. generals and politicians continue to clamor for arms expansion and war preparation, attempting to convince the U.S. public that the United States is being "threatened" by the Soviet Union's missile superiority. The commentary pointed out that everyone with a clear head knows that the Soviet Union's missile superiority only serves the purpose of consolidating peace.

The commentary believes that the purpose of the U.S. generals and politicians' clamoring is to obtain huge dollar profits. The commentary cited as an example that when U.S. President Eisenhower mentioned in his budget report that he would reduce the budget expenditure on aircraft and increase the budget expenditure on missiles, the advocates of the U.S. "Boeing Aircraft Company," which manufactures B-52 bombers, clamored that the United States was in "threat" and demanded maintaining "the highest degree of vigilance," requesting an appropriation of 900 million U.S. dollars to purchase B-52 aircraft that can carry nuclear weapons.

The commentary concluded by pointing out that the main danger today is the U.S. merchants of death's desire for profit. Therefore, exposing and isolating these people will be one of the most important contributions to preparing for the summit meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, February 12th. The Hungarian "People's Freedom Daily" attacked in a commentary today that West Germany, with the support of U.S. imperialism, continues to implement a "cold war" policy.

The commentary said that Bonn is stepping up its conspiracy of atomic armament. And Eisenhower recently stated that the United States is prepared to provide its allies with atomic weapons.

The commentary emphasized that Bonn's "cold war" policy has always been the main obstacle to solving the German problem. Not only did the Bonn authorities once again reject the proposals recently put forward by the German Democratic Republic for a genuine solution to the German problem, but they also tried every possible way to make the German problem more complicated, attempting to prevent the Berlin problem from being resolved at the summit meeting in May.

Commenting on the simultaneous meetings of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Assembly of West Germany on the 10th, the commentary said that these two simultaneous meetings once again confirmed two completely different policies. The People's Chamber believes that the key issue to resolving the German problem at present is the conclusion of a peace treaty. Therefore, it strives to find ways to bring the two German governments closer and promote the resolution of the German problem, and suggests that countries that are unwilling to sign a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic can sign a peace treaty with West Germany, while those who are willing to sign a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic can sign a treaty with it; but the two treaties should resolve the same issues.

The commentary emphasized that this new initiative will greatly help resolve the German problem. On the contrary, the Federal Assembly has only once again exposed the conspiracy of its "cold war" policy.

    苏朝罗等国报纸谴责美国战争政策
    美帝国主义战略的侵略实质未变
    新华社莫斯科13日电　苏联“海军报”13日发表评论，揭露美帝国主义的战争政策。
    评论说，美帝国主义的对外政策是确立世界统治，这样就产生了他们的全球侵略战争的战略。但是，世界形势迅速地改变了。对于美帝国主义的重大打击是丧失了原子垄断。他们在火箭技术上也落后了。现在，军事上的许多问题必须按新方式来解决。战略空军已经过时，不能和火箭竞争。外国军事基地网也丧失了原来的意义。美国领土不受损害的神话已经破产。这样美国冒险家们的实力政策和战略已经破产了。
    评论指出，和平的道路对美帝国主义者并不合意，他们没有改变军事战略的侵略实质，而是千方百计地给自己的军事战略穿上新装，“有限战争”、“地方性战争”、“小战争”等等理论被创造出来了。
    评论指出，“有限战争”的理论是帝国主义准备全球战争的一种伪装和掩饰。核战争的提倡者提出“有限战争”这类理论，是企图用抽象言谈来代替实质，以便欺骗劳动群众和向他们灌输这样的思想，似乎“有限战争”、“地方性战争”不会酿成新的世界大战。
    评论指出，资产阶级的战略家们提出各种小型战争的概念是希望用各个击破的方式来镇压走上独立发展道路的人民，甚至还想来侵略一些社会主义国家。
    十分清楚，所谓“有限战争”的说法并不意味着帝国主义拒绝准备新的世界性战争。全面的核战争的理论并未放弃。但是，五角大楼因怕受到惩罚，就来欺骗人民。
    评论最后说，任何谎言都不能帮助美帝国主义欺骗世界的舆论。世界人民已了解，在火箭武器和核武器时代有限的战争有变成全面原子战争的危险。
    新华社平壤13日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表评论，谴责美帝国主义者把新式导弹运入南朝鲜、在南朝鲜进行大规模军事演习以及美国高级军人经常不断地到南朝鲜鼓吹备战等挑衅行为。
    评论说，“美帝国主义在南朝鲜的备战阴谋活动不仅恶化了朝鲜的局势，而且成为对远东和平和安全的威胁。”
    评论指出，“美帝国主义在南朝鲜进行的这种阴谋活动更加赤裸裸地暴露了华盛顿当局的丑恶本质，他们虽然高唱‘和平’，实际上是在和平的幌子下拼命地追求‘冷战’、疯狂地扩张军备和准备战争。”评论说，美帝国主义的任何挑衅都吓不倒朝鲜人民，也绝不能挫折南朝鲜人民的反美反李斗争。“如果美帝国主义者和李承晚集团胆敢冒险燃起新战争的火焰，必将以它们自己的悲惨灭亡而告终。今天朝鲜人民的团结比任何时候都更加牢固了，并且有着伟大的同盟者。美帝国主义必须把包括原子和导弹武器在内的一切战争工具立即从南朝鲜撤走；撤出和撤销在亚洲一切地区的美国军队和美军基地。这才是巩固朝鲜和平、促进和平解决朝鲜问题、维护和巩固远东和平的唯一的正当道路。”
    新华社布加勒斯特10日电　“自由罗马尼亚报”10日发表评论，谴责美国的将军和政客们继续叫嚣扩军备战。
    评论说，在最高级会议召开前夕，美国的将军和政客们继续叫嚷扩军备战，企图使美国公众相信，美国正受到苏联导弹优势的“威胁”。评论指出，每个头脑清醒的人都知道，苏联的导弹优势只服务于巩固和平的目的。
    评论认为，美国将军和政客们叫嚣的目的，在于获取巨额美元利润。评论举例说，当美国总统艾森豪威尔在预算报告中提到要缩减飞机的预算开支而增加导弹的预算开支时，制造B—52型轰炸机的美国“波音飞机公司”的辩护士们叫嚷美国正处于“威胁”中，要求保持“最高度的警戒”，要求拨款九亿美元以购买可以携带核武器的B—52型飞机。
    评论最后指出，今天的主要危险是美国死亡贩子的利润欲。因此，揭露和孤立这些人，将是为准备最高级会议而作的极重要的贡献之一。
    新华社布达佩斯12日电　匈牙利“人民自由报”今天在一篇评论中抨击西德在美帝国主义的支持下继续执行“冷战”政策。
    评论说，波恩正在加紧进行原子武装的阴谋活动。而艾森豪威尔最近曾表示，美国准备向它的盟国提供原子武器。
    评论强调指出，波恩的“冷战”政策一直是解决德国问题的最主要障碍。波恩当局不仅又一次在最近拒绝了德意志民主共和国为真正解决德国问题而提出的倡议，而且千方百计地要使德国问题变得更加复杂化，企图使柏林问题在5月份召开的政府首脑会议上得不到任何解决。
    评论在谈到同时在10日举行的德意志民主共和国人民议院会议和西德联邦议院会议时说，这两个同时举行的会议又一次证实了两个完全不同的政策。人民议院认为，目前解决德国问题的关键问题是缔结和约，因此竭力寻找使两个德国政府接近和促进德国问题的解决的办法，并建议凡是不愿同德意志民主共和国签订和约的国家可以同西德签订和约，而愿意同德意志民主共和国签订的国家则同它签订和约；但两个和约应当解决同样的问题。
    评论强调指出，这一新的倡议将大大有助于德国问题的解决。相反地，联邦议院只是再一次暴露其“冷战”政策的阴谋而已。
