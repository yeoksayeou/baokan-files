Currently, over 116,000 professional fishing personnel organized by the people's communes are engaged in ship repair, net mending, and fishing production, with the fishing season starting about a month earlier than in previous years. By the end of January, the marine catch reached 15,227 tons, fulfilling 121% of the monthly plan, an increase of more than double compared to the same period last year.

In preparation for the spring fishing season, various localities have vigorously promoted tool innovation. There are now more than 2,500 trawls across the province, and many areas have basically achieved trawlerization. Langya Commune in Jiaonan County has 177 fishing boats and 166 trawls.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing – Various regions in Jiangsu Province are actively preparing for the spring marine fishing season. Twenty-two counties and cities across the province have prepared over 2,400 fishing boats to participate in spring fishing, including over 100 newly added motorized sailing fishing boats, bringing the total number of motorized sailing boats to about three times that of last year; in addition, fifteen fishing vessels are participating in production.

Commercial departments in various localities have transferred large quantities of materials to meet the needs of fishing production, with the supply of moso bamboo, tannin extract, timber, and cotton yarn increasing significantly compared to last year. Coastal ports are establishing and improving purchasing and supply organizations to support fishermen's production.

Party committees at all levels attach great importance to the leadership of spring fishing production. Qidong County has organized aquatic product, commerce, transportation, public security and other departments to establish spring fishing production command organizations at all levels, led by the Party organization secretary, to provide unified leadership. Recently, various localities in Nantong Prefecture also organized spring fishing production inspection groups to go deep into ports and fishing boats to check production preparation, summarize experiences, and help fishermen study and solve specific problems in production.
