Xinhua News Agency, 20th: Mr. Yasui Kaoru, director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, who is currently visiting China, held a reception in Beijing this afternoon to entertain people from all walks of life in China.

In his speech, Yasui Kaoru said that Chinese friends have given great support to the Japanese movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs for a long time, and he expressed his heartfelt thanks. In his speech, he sternly condemned Kishida Nobusuke's signing of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, which more blatantly antagonized China. He also proposed a toast to China's great construction and Great Leap Forward, to the friendly relations between the people of Japan and China, and to world peace.

Liao Chengzhi, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, said in his speech at the reception that he fully agreed with the program recently put forward by the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. He said that the Council advocates friendly coexistence between China and Japan and efforts to promote the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan; advocates the return of Okinawa to Japan; and calls for the immediate abolition of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. We wish the Council greater success in achieving these three programs.

While thanking Mr. Yasui Kaoru for today's reception, Liao Chengzhi said that your struggle against atomic and hydrogen bombs is also our struggle, and your victory is also our victory. No matter how much obstruction and difficulty there is in the world, the friendship between the people of China and Japan cannot be destroyed by any force.

Liao Chengzhi also denounced Kishida Nobusuke's policy of antagonizing China. He said that as long as the Kishida Nobusuke government does not abandon its policy of antagonizing China and does not abandon its Japan-U.S. military alliance policy, it will be absolutely impossible to break the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations.

Yoshida Yoshikiyo, Deputy Secretary-General of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, who came to China with Yasui Kaoru, attended the reception.

Among those invited to attend the reception were Bao Erhan, Li Dequan, Wu Defeng, Zhang Zhizhang, Xu Guangping, Xia Yan, Yang Hansheng, Ouyang Yuqian, Wang Yunsheng, Xie Bingxin, Chen Yu, Wu Maosun, Qu Tangliang, Xie Nanguang, Ni Peijun, Zhao Anbo, Zheng Senyu, and Sun Pinghua.

Japanese, Korean, and Sudanese peace activists in Beijing, Kinkazu Saionji, Hwang Bong-koo, and Keir, as well as the head of the Japanese "Zenshinza" Theater Company, who is currently visiting China for performances, Chojuro Kawarasaki, and the deputy heads, Kanyaemon Nakamura and Gasei Miyagawa, also attended the reception.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th: Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, received Yasui Kaoru, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, and Yoshida Yoshikiyo, Deputy Secretary-General of the Council, who are currently visiting China, this morning. Kinkazu Saionji, a Japanese peace activist in Beijing, was present at the reception.

    新华社20日讯　正在我国访问的日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁先生，今天下午在北京举行酒会，招待中国各方面的人士。
    安井郁在致词中说，中国朋友们长期以来给了日本禁止原子弹和氢弹运动很大支持，他表示衷心的感谢。他在致词中严厉谴责日本岸信介签订日美军事同盟条约，更加露骨地敌视中国。他还提议为中国的伟大建设和大跃进，为日中两国人民的友好关系和世界和平干杯。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席廖承志在酒会上致词，表示完全赞同日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会最近提出的纲领。他说，协议会主张中日两国友好相处和努力促进中日两国恢复邦交；主张冲绳岛归还给日本；立即废除日美军事同盟条约。我们祝协议会在实现这三个纲领中取得更大的胜利。
    廖承志在感谢安井郁先生今天的招待时说，你们的反对原子弹和氢弹的斗争也就是我们的斗争，你们的胜利也就是我们的胜利。不管世界上有多大阻碍和多大困难，中日两国人民的友谊是任何力量破坏不了的。
    廖承志还斥责岸信介敌视中国的政策。他说，岸信介政府一天不放弃敌视中国的政策，一天不放弃日美军事同盟的政策，要打开中日两国关系的僵局是绝无可能的。
