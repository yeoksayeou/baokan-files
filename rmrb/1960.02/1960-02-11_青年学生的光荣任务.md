    The 17th National Student Congress has concluded victoriously. The convocation of this congress coincides with a period of rapid development in our great motherland. The glorious task of our young students is: under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to hold high the glorious banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, actively respond to Chairman Mao's call to be "good in health, good in study, and good in work," implement the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor," strive to cultivate themselves into working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert, and be good communist students.

    It has been four years since the last congress held in 1955. During this period, China has undergone great changes. Since 1958, the people of the whole country, including the vast number of young students, have achieved continuous great leaps forward for two years under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for building socialism. The vast number of young students have greatly improved their political and ideological awareness because they have been educated by the Party in the socialist revolution movements on various political and ideological fronts. Many young students have established a proletarian world outlook. In the great leap forward in the Party's educational cause, they have used both their brains and their hands, combining production with learning, gaining comprehensive knowledge, and achieving all-round success in moral, intellectual, and physical education. With tenacious revolutionary will, they have constantly conquered scientific fortresses. Many cutting-edge scientific research projects and cutting-edge products, such as large planetariums, analog electronic computers, cyclotrons, program-controlled machine tools, etc., have been manufactured through the painstaking research of young students and the help of teachers. Many famous construction projects in China, such as the Miyun Reservoir, the National Museum of Chinese History, and the Beijing Railway Station, etc., were designed by young students or with their participation. Many students have written factory histories and commune histories, and have written better academic works. Things that young students did not dare to think about in the past, they have thought of. Things that young students did not dare to do in the past, they have done. Many worker-peasant students have worked diligently and strived to improve themselves, and a large number of advanced models have emerged. The reason why young students have achieved such significant achievements is precisely because they have held high the banner of Mao Zedong and dispelled the haze of bourgeois educational thought.

    To be a good communist student, this is the requirement of the Party and the state for the vast number of young students. To change the "poor and blank" face of our country and to build our country into a powerful socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern scientific culture as soon as possible, we must cultivate a strong contingent of working-class intellectuals. Students are an important part of this contingent. The standard of a good student varies in each era. The standard of a good student in our socialist society is to have communist ideas and modern scientific knowledge. Such good students are the proletarian intellectuals who are both red and expert that our country needs and are the reserve force for building socialism and communism.

    Communist ideology is the most revolutionary world outlook that guides the actions of young students in our country. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On New Democracy": "Communism is the entire ideological system of the proletariat, and it is also a new social system. This ideological system and social system are different from any other ideological system and any other social system. It is the most complete, most progressive and revolutionary and most reasonable since the history of mankind." Every young student must arm their minds with communist ideology and must study hard Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. A high tide of studying Marxism-Leninism and studying Mao Zedong's works is now being set off throughout the country. Every young student must strive to be the best in this high tide, learn and master Mao Zedong Thought, better transform their ideology, and improve their ideological and political level.

    To establish communist ideology, one must break bourgeois ideology. This is the foundation for the progress of young students. Some people say that young students are young and have no direct contact with the old society, and it is impossible to have bourgeois ideas. They regard young people as people who are above class, which is wrong. In fact, there are still many students who come from exploiting-class families, and are infected with this or that kind of bourgeois ideology and habits. They have to go through a difficult process of ideological transformation before they can establish a communist world outlook. The situation of students from worker-peasant families is somewhat different, but they may also be affected by bourgeois ideology from other aspects of society, so they also need to carry out ideological transformation and ideological exercise. It should be seen that, thanks to the correct leadership and cordial care of the Party, the vast majority of young students in our country are determined to take the road of working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Their progress is also very rapid. However, we must never be satisfied with the achievements we have made. Young students are the reserve force for socialist and communist construction. In order to shoulder this great historical task, their minds should eliminate all bourgeois ideological influences. Here, we must never underestimate the influence of bourgeois ideology on young students. The "white and expert road" is a concrete reflection of the bourgeois individualist world outlook in schools. And the struggle between the "red and expert road" and the "white and expert road" is also the struggle between the proletarian world outlook and the bourgeois world outlook, that is, the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. At present, not only is there still class struggle at home, but there is also a more serious class struggle internationally. While stepping up its arms race, U.S. imperialism is using various despicable means under the guise of peace to carry out ideological infiltration into socialist countries. Modern revisionism, represented by Yugoslav revisionism, is rooted in the influence of the domestic bourgeoisie and succumbs to the pressure of imperialism. U.S. imperialism is constantly trying to bring about so-called "peaceful evolution" in socialist countries by spreading bourgeois ideological toxins and the American way of life. To eliminate the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie and establish the proletarian world outlook is the requirement of the Party and the state for every young student. Therefore, every young student must study Mao Zedong's works hard and arm their minds with dialectical materialism. Mao Zedong's works are a model of the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution. Studying Mao Zedong's works and establishing a proletarian world outlook are of great historical significance for the sound development of the political ideology of young people in our country and for the complete victory of the revolutionary cause of our country.

    Every young student must raise their communist ideological awareness and must establish a communist labor attitude. The Party's policy of "combining education with productive labor" and "intellectualizing workers and peasants and laboring intellectuals" has proven to be the correct path to most rapidly completing the cultural revolution, the education revolution, and eliminating the difference between mental and physical labor. The face of school education in our country has undergone tremendous changes due to the implementation of this policy, which has not only greatly improved students' political and ideological awareness and enhanced their labor views, class views, mass views, and collective views, but also closely combined learning and application, achieving teaching work and scientific research work. Great achievements. Only by thoroughly laboring can intellectuals truly serve the people wholeheartedly and be able to quickly climb the peak of world science and culture. The idea of ​​looking down on physical labor is a typical bourgeois idea. Only by establishing a communist labor attitude, combining mental labor with physical labor, having the ambition to benefit society, and having no selfish intentions can one be worthy of the glorious title of the new Chinese youth cultivated by Mao Zedong Thought.

    Young students are the builders of the future of the motherland. To build our country into a strong country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern scientific culture, young students must master rich scientific and cultural knowledge and climb the peak of scientific culture. Books accumulate the valuable heritage of predecessors, which we must inherit critically; practical scientific and technological problems are put forward in productive labor, which we must study hard. As an old saying in China goes, "The sea does not refuse water, so it can become great; the mountain does not refuse soil, so it can become high." It is the same for young students to seek knowledge. They must work hard and study hard, expand their knowledge field, and lay a deep and solid foundation. There will be difficulties in learning. However, as long as young students establish a proletarian world outlook, they will have the greatest courage, strive to be the best, and climb the peak. Hao Jianxiu, a student of Shanghai East China Textile Engineering College, was originally a textile worker. Under the cultivation of the Party, she overcame the difficulties in learning with the greatest perseverance, carried forward the ambition of the working class, and achieved excellent academic results. Li Zengcheng, a student of the spare-time university of Shenyang Liming Machinery Factory, used to self-study the courses from elementary school to middle school. Now, combined with productive labor, he conducts scientific research and solves many key problems in production. Aren't these all good examples? A metaphor is well said, seeking knowledge is like building a pyramid, the larger the foundation, the higher the top of the tower. Under the guidance of the Party, young students in our country have knocked on the door of the palace of science and excellently completed many scientific research tasks in production. This just shows that as long as one sets great ambitions and lays a solid foundation, it is possible to master the cutting edge and achieve high-level breakthroughs.

    The East Wind is continuing to prevail over the West Wind in the world, and the socialist construction of the motherland is continuing to leap forward. What is placed in front of young students is a good situation; looking forward to the future of young students, it is a bright future. Under the cordial teaching of the Party and Chairman Mao, young students, together with the working people, must all establish the great ambition of the proletariat, the great ambition of the nation, and the great ambition of communism, go all out, be good communist students, and climb the peak of science and culture.

    青年学生的光荣任务
    中华全国学生第十七届代表大会胜利闭幕了。这次大会的召开，正处在伟大的祖国飞跃发展的时期。我国青年学生的光荣任务是：在中国共产党的领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉旗帜，积极响应毛主席“身体好，学习好，工作好”的号召，贯彻执行党的“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针，努力培养自己成为又红又专的工人阶级知识分子，作一个共产主义的好学生。
    从1955年召开的上届代表大会以来，到现在已经四年了。在这个时期中，我国经历了伟大的变化。1958年以来，全国人民，包括广大青年学生在内，在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，连续两年实现了大跃进。广大青年学生由于在历次政治战线和思想战线的社会主义革命运动中受到党的教育，政治思想觉悟大大提高。许多青年学生已经树立起无产阶级的世界观。他们在党的教育事业大跃进中，既动脑，又动手，生产同学习相结合，获得了全面的知识，作到德育、智育、体育全面丰收。他们以顽强的革命意志，不断攻克科学堡垒。许多尖端科学研究项目和尖端产品，如大型天象仪、模拟电子计算机、回旋加速器、程序控制机床，等等，都经过青年学生的苦心研究和教师的帮助，制造出来了。我国许多著名建设项目，如密云水库、中国历史博物馆、北京火车站，等等，都是由青年学生设计或者有他们参加设计的。许多学生编写出了工厂史和公社史，编写出较好的学术著作。过去青年学生不敢想的事情，他们想出来了。过去青年学生不敢做的事情，他们做出来了。许多工农学生，更是勤学苦练，发奋图强，出现了大批的先进标兵。青年学生所以取得这样重大的成就，正是由于高举毛泽东的旗帜，驱散了资产阶级教育思想的阴霾雾瘴的结果。
    作一个共产主义的好学生，这是党和国家对广大青年学生的要求。要改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌，把我们的国家尽快地建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的强大的社会主义的国家，就必须培养一支强大的、工人阶级的知识分子队伍。学生是这个队伍的重要的组成部分。所谓好学生，每个时代都有它不同的标准，我们的社会主义社会的好学生的标准就是要具有共产主义思想和现代科学知识，这样的好学生，才是我们的国家所需要的又红又专的无产阶级知识分子，是建设社会主义和共产主义的后备军。
    共产主义思想是指导我国青年学生行动的最革命的世界观。毛泽东同志在“新民主主义论”中说过：“共产主义是无产阶级的整个思想体系，同时又是一种新的社会制度。这种思想体系和社会制度，是区别于任何别的思想体系和任何别的社会制度的，是自有人类历史以来，最完全最进步最革命最合理的。”每一个青年学生，都要用共产主义思想把头脑武装起来，都必须刻苦努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志的著作。现在全国范围内正在掀起一个学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东著作的热潮。每一个青年学生都要在这个热潮中力争上游，学习和掌握毛泽东思想，更好地改造思想，提高自己的思想水平和政治水平。
    立共产主义思想，就必须破资产阶级思想。这是青年学生进步的基础。有人说，青年学生年纪轻，同旧社会没有什么直接联系，不可能有资产阶级思想。他们把青年看成是超阶级的人，这是不对的。事实上，现在仍有不少的学生是剥削阶级家庭出身的，沾染着这样那样的资产阶级思想和习气，他们要经过一段艰苦的思想改造的过程后才能树立共产主义的世界观。工农家庭出身的学生情况不同一些，但也可能从社会其他方面受到资产阶级思想影响，因而也需要进行思想改造和思想锻炼。应当看到，由于党的正确领导和亲切关怀，我国绝大多数青年学生在毛泽东思想的指导下，是决心走又红又专的工人阶级知识分子的道路的。他们的进步也是很快的。但是，绝不能满足于已有的成就。青年学生是社会主义、共产主义建设的后备军。为了担当这个伟大的历史任务，他们的头脑应当排除一切资产阶级的思想影响。在这里，绝对不能低估资产阶级思想对于青年学生的影响。“白专道路”就是资产阶级个人主义的世界观在学校中的一种具体反映。而“红专道路”同“白专道路”的斗争，也就是无产阶级世界观同资产阶级世界观的斗争，也就是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。现在，不但国内还有阶级斗争，国际范围内也有更严重的阶级斗争。美帝国主义一面加紧备战，一面在和平的伪装下利用各种卑鄙手段向社会主义国家实行思想渗入。以南斯拉夫修正主义为代表的现代修正主义就是根源于国内资产阶级影响和屈服于帝国主义的压力。美帝国主义无时无刻不企图通过散布资产阶级的思想毒素和美国生活方式，来使社会主义国家发生所谓“和平蜕变”。肃清资产阶级的思想影响，树立无产阶级的世界观，这是党和国家对每一个青年学生的要求。因此，每个青年学生必须努力学习毛泽东著作，用辩证唯物主义来武装自己的头脑。毛泽东著作是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践相结合的典范。学习毛泽东著作，树立无产阶级世界观，对于我国青年政治思想的健全发展，对于我国革命事业的彻底胜利，有着重大的历史意义。
    每个青年学生要提高共产主义思想觉悟，就必须树立共产主义的劳动态度。党提出的“教育与生产劳动相结合”、“工农群众知识化，知识分子劳动化”的方针，实践证明是最迅速地完成文化革命、教育革命，消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动差别的正确道路。我国学校教育的面貌，由于贯彻执行这个方针而发生了巨大的变化，不但大大地提高了学生政治思想觉悟，增强了他们的劳动观点、阶级观点、群众观点和集体观点，而且也使学与用密切地结合起来，取得教学工作与科学研究工作的巨大的成绩。知识分子只有彻底劳动化，才能真正全心全意地为人民服务，才有可能迅速攀登世界科学文化的高峰。那种看不起体力劳动的思想是一种典型的资产阶级的思想。只有树立共产主义的劳动态度，做到脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合，有为社会造福之志，而无自私自利之心，这才配得起毛泽东思想培育下的新中国青年的光荣称号。
    青年学生是祖国未来的建设者。要把我们国家建设成为具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的强国，青年学生必须掌握丰富的科学文化知识，攀登科学文化的高峰。书籍中积累了前人的宝贵的遗产，我们必须批判地继承；生产劳动中提出了实际的科学技术问题，我们必须刻苦钻研。我国古话说，“海不辞水，故能成其大；山不辞土，故能成其高。”青年学生求学问，也是这样，要认真劳动，又要认真读书，展拓自己的知识领域，把基础打得深，打得牢。学习中是会有困难的。但是，青年学生只要树立了无产阶级世界观，就会有最大的勇敢，力争上游，攀登高峰。上海华东纺织工学院学生郝建秀，原是一个纺织工人。她在党的培养下，以最大毅力战胜了学习上的困难，发扬了工人阶级的志气，取得优秀的学习成绩。沈阳黎明机械厂业余大学学生李增成，过去自修完小学到中学的课程，现在结合生产劳动，进行科学研究，解决了生产上许多关键问题。这些不都是很好的例证吗？有个比喻说得好，求学如砌金字塔一样，基础越大，塔顶越高。我国的青年学生在党的指引下，敲开科学之宫的大门，出色地完成了许多生产上的科学上的研究任务。这正说明了，只要立下雄心大志，打好基础，就有可能掌握尖端，做到高层突破。
    世界上东风正在继续压倒西风，祖国社会主义建设正在继续跃进。摆在青年学生面前，是美好的形势；展望青年学生未来，是锦绣的前程。在党和毛主席的亲切教导下，青年学生同劳动人民一起，个个要立无产阶级的大志，立民族的大志，立共产主义的大志，鼓足干劲，做共产主义好学生，攀登科学文化的高峰。
