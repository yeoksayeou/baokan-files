    Implementing the Party's Education Policy, Changing the Past Backwardness
    Anhui Higher Education Leaps Forward

    (Reported by our newspaper) Under the leadership of the Party, Anhui Province's higher education has achieved rapid development and improvement in the past year or so, changing its past backward state.

    The foundation of higher education in Anhui was very weak. On the eve of liberation, there were only two schools with very rudimentary equipment. After liberation, Anhui's higher education experienced rapid development. In the years before 1958, three more institutions of higher learning were successively established. Since the Great Leap Forward, higher education has developed even more rapidly. Now, the province has increased the number of institutions of higher learning to thirty-two, fifteen times more than in 1949. The number of students has increased from 1,052 in 1949 to more than 28,000, an increase of more than twenty times. Before liberation, the two institutions of higher learning had very few departments, and some departments had only a few students, or even only one or two students. Now, Hefei University of Technology alone has seven departments and seventeen specialties, and the newly established Anhui University also has seven departments and nine specialties. Since liberation, institutions of higher learning throughout the province have trained more than 8,300 construction talents of various types for the country.

    Anhui's institutions of higher learning have not only greatly developed in quantity, but also made rapid leaps in quality. First of all, the proportion of students with worker and peasant backgrounds has greatly increased. In the old schools, the vast majority of students were children of landlords and the bourgeoisie, and the laboring people were deprived of the right to education. Now, large numbers of children of the laboring people have entered institutions of higher learning for advanced studies. According to statistics, the proportion of students with worker and peasant backgrounds in institutions of higher learning has increased year by year, accounting for 25.47% of the total number of students in 1953, and now accounting for 50.59%, with some schools reaching more than 70%. Secondly, due to the implementation of the Party's policy of combining education with labor, students generally participate in labor and run factories and farms on a large scale. The vast number of teachers and students actively participated in the mass steelmaking movement, and the students' spiritual outlook has undergone significant changes, with everyone loving labor and the laboring people. Last summer, 265 students from Anhui University who returned to Shanghai spontaneously organized themselves to participate in labor in the Shanghai suburban communes for a month, and were warmly praised by the commune members. Some students at Anhui Medical College used to dislike workers and peasants and were unwilling to go to factories and the countryside to treat the laboring people, but now they feel that serving the laboring people is a glorious thing. In the summer of 1958, students enthusiastically responded to the call to conduct surveys on schistosomiasis and filariasis in Qingyang, Zongyang, and other counties, and successfully completed their tasks.

    In order to improve the quality of teaching, various institutions of higher learning have adopted methods such as collective lesson preparation, trial lectures before classes, and sending teachers out for further studies to train teachers. Zheng Zhuma, a newly graduated teaching assistant from the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics of Anhui University, gave a new course on differential equations of higher mathematics, and won the praise of leaders and students. Due to the improvement of teachers' professional level, the quality of teaching has also improved, and students' academic performance has also improved rapidly.

    Various institutions of higher learning have also achieved great results in scientific research. Hefei University of Technology completed 576 scientific research projects in 1958 and 886 last year, including the geological map of Anhui Province drawn by the Geology Department in conjunction with the general survey and the Novikov gear reducer successfully trial-produced by the Mechanism Department, which are of great value. The newly established Anhui University has completed more than 50 scientific research projects in the past year. Teachers and students of the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics have successfully trial-produced analog computers for Laplace equations and biharmonic equations. When Anhui Medical College studied the D105 formula for the treatment of hypertension, it organized senior students to conduct surveys and collect data in factories and cities, and looked for clues to conduct tests in the absence of equipment, and finally made the research a success. By giving play to the role of new and old teachers, the hospital has also successfully trial-produced various instruments such as cardiac fibrillation machines and tympanic membrane projectors, and has achieved preliminary results in the treatment of cancer, craniotomy, heart, and liver lobe resection. The hospital has also written many scientific papers and has won the collective award of "Pioneer of Medical and Health Technology Revolution" awarded by the Ministry of Health.

    贯彻党的教育方针　改变过去落后面貌
    安徽高等教育突飞猛进
    本报讯　安徽省高等教育事业在党的领导下，一年多来获得迅速发展和提高，改变了过去的落后面貌。
    安徽高等教育的基础非常薄弱，解放前夕仅有两所设备十分简陋的学校。解放后，安徽的高等教育有了突飞猛进的发展。1958年以前的几年中，又陆续建立了三所高等学校，大跃进以来，高等学校教育获得更快的发展，现在全省高等学校已增加到三十二所，比1949年增加了十五倍。学生由1949年的一千零五十二人增加到二万八千多人，增加了二十多倍。解放前两所高等学校院系很少，有的系只有几个学生，甚至只有一、两个学生。现在光合肥工业大学就有七个系，十七个专业，新创办的安徽大学也有七个系，九个专业。解放后全省高等学校为国家培养了各类建设人材八千三百多人。
    安徽高等学校不仅在数量上有了很大发展，在质量上也有了飞快的跃进。首先，学校的工农成份的学生大大增加。旧的学校学生绝大部分是地主、资产阶级的子弟，劳动人民被剥夺了受教育的权利。现在，劳动人民的子弟大批进入高等学府进行深造。据统计，高等学校工农成份学生的比例逐年提高，1953年占全部在校学生总数的25．47％，现在已占50．59％，其中有的学校占到70％以上。其次，由于贯彻了党的教育和劳动相结合的方针，学生普遍参加劳动，大办工厂和农场，广大师生积极参加了全民炼钢的运动，学生的精神面貌起了显著的变化，个个热爱劳动，热爱劳动人民。安徽大学去年暑期回上海的二百六十五名学生，自动地组织起来到上海郊区公社参加劳动一个月，受到了社员的热烈赞扬。安徽医学院有的学生过去嫌工人和农民脏，不愿下厂、下乡为劳动人民治病，现在他们却觉得为劳动人民服务是光荣的事情。1958年夏天学生们热烈响应号召，到青阳、枞阳等县普查血吸虫、血丝虫病，并胜利地完成了任务。
    各高等学校为了提高教学质量，采取了集体备课，课前进行试讲，派出去进修等办法来培养教师。安徽大学数学力学系刚毕业的助教郑主庥新开高等数学的微分方程，获得了领导和学生们的称赞。由于提高了教师的业务水平，教学质量随着提高，学生的学习成绩也迅速提高。
    各高等学校在科学研究上也取得了很大成绩。合肥工业大学1958年完成五百七十六个科学研究项目，去年完成八百八十六个，其中有重大价值的有：地质系结合普查绘制的安徽省大地构造图，机制系试制成功的诺维可夫齿轮减速箱等。新建的安徽大学一年来共完成科学研究项目五十多个，数学力学系师生试制成功了拉普拉斯方程和重调和方程摸拟计算机。安徽医学院在研究治疗高血压病D105方时，在缺少仪器设备的条件下，组织高年级学生到工厂、城市进行普查、搜集资料，找线索进行化验，终于使这次研究获得成功。由于发挥了新老教师的作用，该院还试制成功心纤维颤动机，鼓膜投影机等各种仪器，并且在治疗癌症，开颅、心脏、肝叶切除等技术方面都获得初步效果。该院还写出了许多篇科学论文，曾经获得卫生部奖给的“医学卫生技术革命先锋”的集体奖状。
