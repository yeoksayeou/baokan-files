    Science Press to Publish
    Three Books on the Achievements of Biological and Geological Surveys
    Science Press will soon publish a batch of books with relatively high academic value, including "Fauna Economica Sinica" (Volumes on Birds, Beasts, and Parasitic Worms), "The Fishes of the South China Sea," and "Lower Triassic Ammonoids from Western Guangxi."

    "Fauna Economica Sinica" (Volumes on Birds, Beasts, and Parasitic Worms) was collectively written by the Institute of Zoology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and relevant units, based on the investigations and research on animals conducted by Chinese zoologists in many regions, as well as research directly related to production practices. These three volumes of "Fauna Economica Sinica," totaling more than 1.5 million words, comprehensively introduce about 470 species of birds, beasts, and parasitic worms of greater economic significance produced in China. They describe in detail their morphological structure, living habits, geographical distribution, and economic significance, and are accompanied by illustrations, distribution maps, and colored external appearance diagrams.

    "Fauna Economica Sinica" can be said to be a summary of the achievements of animal fauna investigation and research in China and the experience of mass production practices. It lays the foundation for compiling a national fauna in the future.

    "The Fishes of the South China Sea" is one of the great works on the Chinese animal fauna. It includes more than 860 species of fish in the South China Sea, of which six new species are new records in China. The book introduces the characteristics of orders, families, and genera according to the classification system, and then describes the morphology, geographical distribution, living habits, and economic significance of each species. This book is based on more than 30,000 specimens collected and investigated in the past five years.

    "Lower Triassic Ammonoids from Western Guangxi" was compiled by Professor Zhao Jinke mainly based on the materials collected during his own geological survey. It includes more than 2,000 pieces of ammonoid specimens collected by the author himself, of which more than 670 are relatively complete, divided into 23 families, 59 genera, and 204 species. Among them, new species account for more than 80%, and there are also ten new genera.

    Ammonoids are reliable evidence for dividing and comparing Upper Paleozoic and Mesozoic marine strata. Researching these fossils can help geological exploration and the search for coal, petroleum, and natural gas. The Triassic strata in China are more developed than in other countries in the world, especially the Lower Triassic strata, which have been found very rarely in other parts of the world. The number of families and genera of Lower Triassic ammonoids in western Guangxi is unprecedented in the world. Moreover, the Lower Triassic ammonoid-bearing strata in western Guangxi have their own significant characteristics. The materials in this book are valuable both for studying the systematic evolution of organisms and for discussing stratigraphic division and geographical distribution.

    科学出版社将出版
    关于生物、地质普查成果的三种书
    科学出版社最近将出版一批具有比较高的学术价值的著作，其中有“中国经济动物志”（鸟、兽、寄生蠕虫三卷）、“南海鱼类志”和“广西西部下三迭纪菊石”等。
    “中国经济动物志”（鸟、兽、寄生蠕虫三卷）是在我国动物学家对许多地区进行动物的调查研究以及对和生产实践直接有关的研究的基础上，由中国科学院动物研究所和有关单位集体编写成的。这三卷经济动物志，共约一百五十余万字，全面地介绍了我国所产经济意义较大的鸟、兽、寄生蠕虫约四百七十余种，详细地描述了它们的形态构造、生活习性、地理分布和经济意义等，并附有插图、分布图和彩色外形图。
    “经济动物志”可以说是我国动物区系调查研究成果和群众生产实践经验的总结。它为今后编著全国动物志奠定了基础。
    “南海鱼类志”是中国动物区系方面的巨著之一。它包括八百六十多种南海鱼类，其中有六个新种在我国还是新记录。全书按分类系统，首先介绍目、科、属的特征，然后叙述每个种的形态、地理分布、生活习性和经济意义。这部书是根据近五年来实际采集调查得来的三万多号标本编写而成的。
    “广西西部下三迭纪菊石”是著者赵金科教授主要根据亲自进行地质普查时采集的材料编著而成的。它包括著者亲自采集的菊石标本二千余件，较整的有六百七十多块，分为二十三科，五十九属，二百零四种。其中，新种约占80％以上，新属也有十属。
    菊石是划分和对比上古生代及中生代海相层的可靠依据。研究这类化石，可以帮助地质勘探，寻找煤、石油和天然气等工作。我国三迭纪地层发育比世界其他各国都完备，特别是下三迭纪地层在世界各地发现的还很少。广西西部下三迭纪菊石的科属之多，更是目前世界各地所未见的。并且，广西西部下三迭纪含菊石地层有其显著的特点。这本书中的材料不论对研究生物的系统演化，或者对讨论地层分层和地理分布都很有价值。
