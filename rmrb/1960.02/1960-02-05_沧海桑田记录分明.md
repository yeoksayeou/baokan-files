Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 4th: TASS reports that the Himalayan region, home to the world's highest peak, Mount Everest, was once a vast ocean in the late Tertiary period (between seventy million and one million years ago). Since then, the thickness of the Earth's crust there has almost doubled. This is indicated by the first geological map of the deep crustal structure recently compiled by Soviet scientists.

This geological map was compiled by Demenitskaya, a staff member of the Soviet Arctic Geological Research Institute, based on gravity measurement and seismic data. It illustrates the distribution of rock formations in the Earth's crust and the unique internal topography of the crust down to a depth of seventy kilometers. Demenitskaya was awarded a Doctor of Geological and Mineralogical Sciences degree for the compilation of this geological map.

Demenitskaya's geological map shows that the Earth's crust at a depth of ten kilometers in the Northern Hemisphere is mainly granite, while in the Southern Hemisphere it is basalt. Between 60 and 80 degrees north latitude, there is a huge granite belt 1,500 to 2,000 kilometers wide. It branches out into three branches to the south. The longest branch extends to the Southern Hemisphere, connecting the Asian continent with the Australian continent.

The geological map identifies the relationship between the existence of young mountain systems and the characteristics of the crustal structure down to a depth of sixty kilometers. The map also shows that the crustal evolution process is uneven. In the last 500 to 600 million years, the thickness of the Earth's crust has increased by 30 to 40 kilometers in some areas, while other areas have remained unchanged.

Soviet experts believe that Demenitskaya's deep-layer map is the most effective method for elucidating the main laws of the structure and development of the Earth's crystalline shell. Professor Feginski, a well-known Soviet geophysicist, told a TASS reporter that this map has significant scientific and practical value. Studying the deep structure of the Earth is one of the most difficult and important tasks of modern geological science. A clear understanding of the deep structure of the Earth's crystalline shell will help to organize scientifically based prospecting work.

    沧海桑田记录分明
    苏联—科学工作者制成第一份地壳深层结构地质图，具有重大科学和实践价值。
    新华社莫斯科4日电　据塔斯社报道，拥有世界最高峰——珠穆朗玛峰的喜马拉雅山地区，在第三纪（距今七千万年到一百万年间）末期曾经是一片汪洋大海，自那时以来，那些地壳厚度几乎增长了一倍。这是苏联科学家最近绘制成的第一份地壳深层结构地质图上表明的。
    这份地质图是由苏联北极地质科学研究所工作人员杰梅尼次卡娅根据重力测定材料和地震材料编制的。它说明了地壳中岩层的分布和地壳中深达七十公里深处的独特内部地形。由于这份地质图的编成，杰梅尼次卡娅获得了地质矿物学博士学位。
    杰梅尼次卡娅的地质图表明，北半球十公里深处主要是花岗岩，而南半球为玄武岩。在北纬六十到八十度之间围着一条宽一千五百到二千公里的巨大的花岗岩带。它往南分出三个分支。最长的一支一直伸展到南半球，把亚洲大陆同澳洲大陆连接起来。
    地质图上确定了年青的高山系统的存在同深至六十公里地壳结构的特点之间的关系。图上还表明，地壳进化过程是不均衡的。在最近五亿到六亿年间，某些地区地壳厚度增加了三十到四十公里，而其它地区却无任何变化。
    苏联专家们认为，杰梅尼次卡娅提出的深层图，是阐明地球晶体壳结构和发展的主要规律的最有效方法。苏联著名地球物理学家费金斯基教授对塔斯社记者说，这张图具有重大的科学和实践价值。研究地球深层结构，是现代地质科学中最困难和最重要的任务之一。明确了解地球晶体壳深层结构，将有助于组织有科学根据的探矿工作。
