    Stop the Barbaric Actions of the US Government in Persecuting Winston
    Commentator of this newspaper
    Today, this newspaper publishes the news released by the Communist Party of the United States condemning the US government's brutal persecution of Henry Winston, one of the leaders of the Communist Party of the United States and an outstanding son of the Black people. Comrade Winston was imprisoned more than four years ago by the US government under the fascist decree of the "Smith Act" on the fabricated so-called "conspiracy charge". During his imprisonment, Winston suffered from a brain tumor. Due to the prison authorities' deliberate obstruction and delay in his diagnosis and treatment, he has almost completely lost his sight, and his legs have become paralyzed. However, now the US government, disregarding the fact that Winston recently underwent a major surgery to remove the brain tumor, refuses to grant him parole for treatment. The US government's sinister attempt to send Winston back to prison at any time is seriously threatening his life. To this end, the Communist Party of the United States appeals to fair-minded public opinion around the world: Stop the barbaric acts of the US government in brutally persecuting Winston. There is no doubt that all people with a sense of justice and those who advocate maintaining humanitarian principles around the world will be indignant at this atrocity of the US government, which violates the most basic humanitarian principles.
    Comrade Henry Winston is an outstanding representative of the American people and the working class. He participated in the unemployed movement from his youth. He was one of the leaders of the "Hunger March" movement in the 1930s in which American workers resisted the cruel exploitation of monopoly capital, and was responsible for the youth department of the National Unemployment Council of the United States. During World War II, Henry Winston, like thousands of American Communists, took up arms to participate in the war against German fascism. After being demobilized in 1945, he led the Black Affairs Committee of the Communist Party of the United States and served as the secretary of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States in 1946. Henry Winston has waged arduous struggles for the democratic rights of American workers and Black people and for the cause of peace for all mankind. He is not only respected by the American people, especially Black people, but also admired by all people in the world who love justice and peace. However, the US government has persecuted such an outstanding fighter for democracy and peace. More than four years ago, the US government threw Henry Winston into prison on fabricated "conspiracy charges". Now, the US government is unwilling to let go of Winston, who is seriously ill, and is carrying out political persecution and racial discrimination against him, attempting to prevent Winston from recovering his health and physically destroy this great life. The American ruling group believes that by adopting such despicable means, they can both put Winston to death and escape the guilt of murder. However, it must be pointed out that if the US government continues to persecute Winston, then it cannot escape being judged by human justice once again as a barbaric executioner.
    The heads of the US government have long portrayed the United States as a "model" of the "free world." US President Eisenhower recently boasted that "our country is founded on the concept that all citizens enjoy freedom and justice." "To promote the personal happiness and overall well-being of our people, we must continue to promote our tradition of equal opportunity regardless of race, religion, or origin." Listen, what fine words these are! But the truth of American society is hundreds of thousands of miles away from these words of "democracy," "freedom," "equality," and "human rights." Although the founder of the notorious "McCarthyism" is now dead, the shadow of McCarthy still looms over the United States. The US government uses a series of fascist laws such as the "McCarran Act" and the "Smith Act" to persecute American Communists and progressives. Since 1949, one hundred and eight American Communist activists and other progressives have been sentenced to imprisonment based solely on the "Smith Act". Many leaders of the Communist Party of the United States have suffered persecution. Henry Winston and Gilbert Green, another leader of the Communist Party of the United States, are still in prison. Their only crime is that they are Communists and they believe in Communism. The US authorities' persecution of William Z. Foster, Honorary Chairman of the Communist Party of the United States, is only because he dedicated his life to fighting for the vital interests of the American people, for peace, and for the noble cause of Communism. The US government even prohibits Comrade Foster, who is eighty years old and seriously ill, from going to the Soviet Union for medical treatment. Recently, the US Un-American Activities Committee has again been illegally subpoenaing Communist Party of the United States leaders Davis and Hall, and is also attempting to persecute the American youth representatives who participated in the last World Youth Festival. This is the American-style "democracy" and "freedom" that Eisenhower speaks of! Other examples are too numerous to mention. And the US government's persecution of Henry Winston is another clear example, as the American "Worker Weekly" pointed out, this is "the true expression of the ruling class's cruel and ruthless justice. This is a concrete crime of the Eisenhower government against humanity."
    The facts thoroughly expose the extreme hypocrisy of American "democracy". The American ruling group implements a policy of aggression and war against the people of the world; at home, it uses all violent means to barbarically suppress the progressive forces in the United States. However, the US government can absolutely not gain any benefit from atrocities like the persecution of Comrade Henry Winston. The sympathy of the American people and the sympathy of progressive humanity around the world are on the side of Comrade Winston. As Comrade William Z. Foster said: "The American imperialists will find that in order to maintain their barbaric system in the United States, they will not only encounter opposition from the American labor forces, but will also encounter increasing opposition worldwide."

    制止美国政府迫害温斯顿的野蛮行为
    本报评论员
    今天本报刊登了美国共产党为谴责美国政府残暴地迫害美国共产党领导人之一、黑人的优秀儿子亨利·温斯顿而发布的新闻。温斯顿同志是在四年多前被美国政府根据“史密斯法”的法西斯法令以莫须有的所谓“阴谋罪”监禁的。在监禁期间，温斯顿患脑瘤，由于监狱当局故意刁难，拖延对他的诊治，他的双目几乎已经完全失明，双腿已经瘫痪。但是，现在美国政府竟不顾温斯顿最近才进行切除脑瘤的大手术，拒绝让他假释出狱进行治疗。美国政府随时要把温斯顿送回监狱去的罪恶的企图，正严重地威胁着他的生命。为此，美国共产党向全世界的公正舆论呼吁：制止美国政府残暴迫害温斯顿的野蛮行为。毫无疑问，全世界一切具有正义感和主张维护人道原则的人们都会对美国政府的这一违反起码的人道原则的暴行表示愤慨。
    亨利·温斯顿同志是美国人民和工人阶级的一位优秀的代表者。他从青年的时候起就参加了失业者的运动。他曾经是三十年代美国工人反抗垄断资本残酷剥削的“饥饿进军”运动的领导人之一，并曾负责过美国全国失业理事会青年部的工作。在第二次世界大战期间，亨利·温斯顿和几千个美国共产党员一样，拿起武器参加了反对德国法西斯的战争。在1945年复员以后，他领导了美国共产党黑人事务委员会的工作，1946年担任了美国共产党全国委员会的书记。亨利·温斯顿为了争取美国工人和黑人的民主权利，为了全人类的和平事业，曾经进行了坚苦卓绝的斗争。他不仅受到美国人民特别是黑人的尊敬，而且受到全世界一切爱好正义与和平的人们的敬仰。但是，美国政府对于这样一位杰出的民主与和平的斗士却横加迫害。四年多以前，美国政府以捏造的“阴谋罪”把亨利·温斯顿投入狱中。现在美国政府对于已患重病的温斯顿都不肯放过，对他实行政治上迫害和种族上的歧视，企图使温斯顿从此不能恢复健康，而从肉体上毁灭掉这个伟大的生命。美国统治集团以为，他们采取这种卑劣的手段，既能致温斯顿于死命，又能够逃避他们杀人的罪责。但是，必须指出，如果美国政府继续迫害温斯顿，那末，它就不能逃脱作为野蛮的刽子手，又一次受到人类正义的裁判。
    美国政府的首脑人物长期以来把美国说成是“自由世界”的“典范”。美国总统艾森豪威尔最近还吹嘘说：“我国是建立在全体公民都享有自由和正义这一概念上的”。“为了促进我国人民的个人幸福和总的幸福，我们必须继续发扬我们的不分种族、宗教和血统机会一律平等的传统”。请听，这是多么好听的言词啊！但是美国社会的真相，却同这些“民主”、“自由”、“平等”、“人权”等等的字眼有相去十万八千里。臭名远扬的“麦卡锡主义”的创始人现在虽已死去了，但麦卡锡的魔影仍然笼罩着美国。美国政府用什么“麦卡伦法”、“史密斯法”等一系列法西斯法案迫害美国共产党人和进步人士。1949年以来，仅仅根据“史密斯法”就有一百零八个美国共产党活动家和其他进步人士被判处徒刑。美国共产党的许多领导人先后都遭受过迫害。而亨利·温斯顿和美共另一领导人吉尔伯特·格林至今仍然身系囹圄。他们的唯一的罪名就是因为他们是共产党人，他们信仰共产主义。美国当局对美国共产党名誉主席威廉·泽·福斯特的迫害只是因为他把自己的一生贡献给了争取美国人民切身利益、争取和平以及崇高的共产主义事业。美国政府甚至禁止已达八十高龄、身患重病的福斯特同志到苏联去就医。最近，美国非美活动委员会又在非法传讯美国共产党领袖戴维斯和霍尔，还企图迫害参加上一届世界青年联欢节的美国青年代表，这就是艾森豪威尔所说的美国式的“民主”和“自由”！其它的例子举不胜举。而美国政府迫害亨利·温斯顿的事件又是一件鲜明的例证，正如美国“工人周报”所指出的，这是美国“统治阶级的司法的残忍无情的真正表现。这是艾森豪威尔政府违反人道的一个具体的罪行”。
    事实彻底戳穿了美国“民主”的极端的虚伪性。美国统治集团对外实行敌视全世界人民的侵略和战争政策；对内则使用一切暴力手段野蛮地压迫美国的进步势力。但是，美国政府绝对不可能在类似迫害亨利·温斯顿同志这样的暴行中得到任何好处。美国人民的同情、全世界进步人类的同情是在温斯顿同志这一边的。诚如威廉·泽·福斯特同志所说：“美国的帝国主义者将会发现，要在美国维持他们的野蛮制度，他们就不但要遭到美国劳工力量的反对，而且越来越在全世界范围内遭到反对”。
