The Fenghuo People's Commune in Qian County, Shaanxi Province, is known throughout the country for its large-scale scientific research. A news item in the People's Daily on February 20th stated that the Fenghuo Commune ignited the flames of technical education. In one year, they trained thousands of technicians, established twenty-nine agricultural science research offices and three hundred and twenty-one specialized experimental teams throughout the commune, cultivated a total of three thousand six hundred mu of experimental fields, and involved more than three thousand eight hundred people in experimental research. Seeing the flames of this large-scale scientific research naturally makes people excited. However, what is even more exciting is that we see the revolutionary flames burning in the hearts of the members of the Fenghuo Commune. Since the commune produced the peasant scientist Wang Baojing, the competitive upsurge of large-scale innovation experiments has risen day by day, not only young people participated, but even the elderly were unwilling to accept it and refused to admit they were old. This year, they started to cultivate an experimental field called "Unwilling to Accept," saying, "Young people create miracles, we are unwilling to accept it; we will also cultivate a few mu and compare the results in the autumn."

This spirit of "unwilling to accept" and "refusing to admit" is a valuable revolutionary quality and a precious revolutionary tradition, which is worth greatly promoting. In the past, we were unwilling to accept the oppression and enslavement of imperialism and feudalism, so we rose up to make revolution and removed the two mountains weighing on our heads; after the victory of the democratic revolution, we were still unwilling to accept it and unwilling to give up, and then carried out the socialist revolution. Today, we are also unwilling to accept our country's "poor and blank" economic situation, so we are carrying out socialist construction in a vigorous manner. The speed of our country's construction has already made capitalist countries beyond our reach, but we are still unwilling to accept it and unwilling to give up, and we must go all out, strive for the upper reaches, and throw capitalist countries far behind in history!

This spirit and determination of unwillingness to accept and unwillingness to give up shines with brilliant light on the bodies of our thousands of revolutionary people. In the current technical innovation and technical revolution movement, there are even more endless examples of this spirit of never giving up until the goal is achieved. The Shenyang Dadong District Steel Ball Bearing Factory originally had only two "old" broken lathes, no money, no technology, 80% of the more than 500 workers in the factory were housewives, and almost all production was manual operation. But they were unwilling to accept this backward situation, and put forward the slogan of "working hard and diligently, relying on our own efforts, making use of simple and crude equipment, building our own indigenous equipment, and arming ourselves," and carried out large-scale technical innovation. What was the result? Now this factory has become a factory with one hundred and seventy-six machines, producing one hundred and fifty thousand sets of steel ball bearings and ten million steel balls annually, and most of the operations have been mechanized and semi-mechanized. The Suzhou Agricultural Machinery Factory is a poor factory merged from six small "alley" factories. They are also unwilling to accept this "poor" face and unwilling to accept the heavy manual operations. As a result, large-scale technical innovations have mechanized and semi-mechanized two hundred and forty-eight processes. Backward becomes advanced, manual operation becomes mechanical operation, ordinary workers climb to the peak of science and technology... The spirit of unwillingness to accept and unwillingness to give up has played a huge role and exerted infinite creative power.

What does this spirit ultimately illustrate? First, it shows that the Chinese people have a high degree of revolutionary consciousness and great ambitions. "Poor and blank" is naturally not good, but the poorer we are, the more we must make revolution. We have great ambitions and lofty aspirations, and we are determined to change from poor to rich, and draw the newest and most beautiful pictures on blank paper. We must not only build socialism, but also build a communist paradise in our country. We want to make revolution, that is, to revolutionize imperialism and revolutionize poverty and backwardness. The "poor and blank" economic situation hinders our happy life, and imperialism has been threatening our security in front of us. How can the Chinese people be willing to accept this situation? How can we be convinced? Second, we are not only unwilling to accept and unconvinced of the current situation, but we will never be willing to accept and never be convinced. Therefore, unwillingness to accept and unwillingness to be convinced shows that we have the spirit of continuous revolution. Our revolutionary goal is so grand and will never end, so our revolutionary pace will never stop. Has our first five-year plan been completed, have we stopped? No! The second five-year plan has been completed three years ahead of schedule, have we stopped? No! The spirit of continuous revolution is always driving us forward! Third, unwillingness to accept and unwillingness to give up shows that we have an indestructible revolutionary will and an unwavering revolutionary nature. We are communists, and we want to realize communism in our country. We will never give up until we achieve this goal! In fact, even when we reach communist society, we will never give up, because by then, we will set even more ambitious goals, and we will strive for even more ambitious goals.

    不甘心，不罢休
    柳笛
    陕西乾县烽火人民公社以大搞科学研究闻名全国。2月20日的人民日报上有一条消息说，烽火公社燃起技术教育的烽火。他们在一年之中培养了上千名技术人员，全社建立了二十九个农业科学研究室、三百二十一个专业试验队，共种植了三千六百亩试验田，参加试验研究的有三千八百多人。看到这种大搞科学研究的烽火，自然使人兴奋不已。然而更加使人兴奋的是，我们看到了燃烧在烽火公社社员心头的革命的烽火。这个公社自从出了农民科学家王保京，大搞革新试验的竞赛热潮一天一天高涨，不仅是青年们参加了，就连老年人也不甘心，不服老。今年他们动手种了一块名叫“不服气”的试验田，说是“青年创奇迹，我们不服气；也来搞几亩，秋后比高低。”
    这种“不甘心”“不服气”的精神，是一种可贵的革命品质，也是一种宝贵的革命传统，值得大大提倡。过去，我们对于帝国主义和封建主义的压迫、奴役，就是不甘心，所以起来闹革命，动手搬掉了压在头上的两座大山；民主革命胜利了，我们还是不甘心、不罢休，接着又进行了社会主义革命。今天，我们又对我国“一穷二白”的经济面貌不甘心，于是轰轰烈烈地进行社会主义建设。我国的建设速度已经使资本主义国家望尘莫及了，我们仍然不甘心、不罢休，还要鼓足干劲，力争上游，把资本主义国家远远地抛在历史的后面！
    这种不甘心、不罢休的精神和决心，在我们的千千万万革命者的身上，闪烁着灿烂的光辉。在当前的技术革新和技术革命运动中，这种不达目的决不罢休的事例，更是层出不穷。沈阳市大东区钢珠轴承厂原来只有两台“老掉牙”的破床子，要钱没钱，要技术没技术，全厂五百多人中80％都是家庭妇女，整个生产几乎全部是手工操作。但是他们不甘心于这种落后状况，提出了“穷干苦干，自力更生，因陋就简，大造土设备，自己武装自己”的口号，大搞技术革新。结果怎么样呢？现在这个厂已经变成一座拥有一百七十六台机器，年产十五万套钢珠轴承和一千万粒钢珠的工厂，大部分操作实现了机械化和半机械化。苏州农业药械厂是由六家“弄堂”小厂合并起来的穷工厂，他们同样对于这种“穷”的面貌不服气，对于笨重的手工操作不甘心，结果大搞技术革新使二百四十八道工序实现机械化和半机械化。后进变先进，手工操作变为机械操作，普通工人攀登上科学技术高峰……不甘心、不罢休的精神，起了巨大的作用，发挥出了无穷的创造力量。
    这种精神归根结底说明了什么问题呢？第一，说明我国人民有着高度的革命自觉，有着伟大的雄心壮志。“一穷二白”自然不好，但是越穷越要革命。我们树雄心立大志，定要由穷变富，在白纸上画出最新最美的图画，不仅要建设社会主义，还要在我国建成共产主义的天堂。我们要革命，就是要革帝国主义的命，革贫困落后的命。“一穷二白”的经济状况阻碍着我们的幸福生活，帝国主义站在我们前面一直在威胁着我们的安全，对于这种情况，中国人民岂肯甘心？怎能服气？第二，我们不仅对于目前的状况不甘心、不服气，而且永远也不会甘心、永远也不会服气。因此，不甘心、不服气，表现了我们具有不断革命的精神。我们的革命目标如此远大，永远也没有止境，我们的革命步伐也就永远不会停止。第一个五年计划完成了，我们停止过吗？没有！第二个五年计划已经提前三年胜利完成了，我们停止了吗？没有！不断革命的精神，永远推动着我们前进！第三，不甘心、不罢休，表现了我们有着无坚不摧的革命意志，有着坚定不移的革命性。我们是共产主义者，要在我国实现共产主义，不达到这个目的，我们也决不罢休！其实，就是到了共产主义社会，我们也决不会罢休的，因为到那时候，我们将会树立更远大的目标，我们又将为更远大的目标而奋斗。
