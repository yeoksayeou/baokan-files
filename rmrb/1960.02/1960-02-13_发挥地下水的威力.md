    Unleash the Power of Groundwater
    Two days ago, this newspaper published an editorial entitled "Prevent Drought Early," with the aim of drawing people's attention to the emerging drought in some areas, so as to take measures as early as possible to eliminate the drought before spring plowing.
    The Nanyang Special District of Henan Province is making great efforts to drill wells and realize the combined use of "three waters" (sky water, surface water, and groundwater). This is an effective measure to fully utilize water sources and strengthen drought prevention and resistance.
    Nanyang is a plain area. Since liberation, especially since the communization, water conservancy construction has achieved brilliant achievements, and irrigation has been automated by gravity flow on a large area of cultivated land. Why is it still necessary to drill wells on a large scale in areas with good water conservancy conditions? Because they conducted investigations and research and came to this correct conclusion from a specific analysis of things. The annual rainfall in Henan Province is about 120 billion cubic meters. After deducting the water flowing to other provinces, seeping into the ground, and evaporating, less than 20 billion cubic meters can be introduced into reservoirs and canals. It is obviously not enough to rely on this water to irrigate 120 million mu of cultivated land in the province. This is calculated based on normal rainfall. If there is a drought, the water level of rivers will drop, and reservoirs will not be able to store more water, the problem will be even more serious. Our task this year is to strive for a better and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production. To make this great task a successful reality, we must take practical measures to resist the main natural disasters—drought and flood, and we must take a "double insurance" approach to the lifeline of agriculture—water, by grasping both surface water and groundwater, so as to achieve "guaranteed harvests regardless of drought or flood." Therefore, drilling wells on a large scale and making full use of groundwater is a very necessary measure.
    Is it very difficult to drill wells? The facts in the Nanyang area prove that with the correct leadership of the Party and the people's communes, this is not difficult. The Nanyang Prefectural Committee's large-scale construction of millions of mu of "well squares" has made well drilling fast and good. The establishment of "well squares" not only broke the boundaries of counties and communes, making the layout of wells reasonable and giving full play to the role of groundwater, but also accelerated the speed of well drilling due to the full play of the superiority of the people's communes' large size and high degree of public ownership and comprehensive planning. In just over two months, the Nanyang area has drilled more than 2,900 wells, and each one meets the specifications. Isn't this speed fast enough?
    Currently, several northern provinces have spring drought emerging. This is a spring drought that has appeared after a hundred-day drought last summer and autumn, so we must recognize its severity. It is now the time when wheat fields need to be irrigated with greening water, and spring fields need to be irrigated with bottom moisture, and the water demand is very large. Therefore, in areas where drought has already emerged, large-scale well drilling is not only of extreme importance to the current spring plowing and production, but also very necessary from the perspective of solving long-term water conservancy construction.

### 发挥地下水的威力

    发挥地下水的威力
    前两天本报发表了“及早防旱”的社论，目的是为了引起人们对若干地区已经露头的旱象的注意，以便及早采取措施，把干旱消灭在春耕之前。
    河南省南阳专区大打机井，实现“三水”（天上水、地上水、地下水）并用，这是充分利用水源，加强防旱抗旱的有效措施之一。
    南阳是平原地区，解放以来，特别是公社化以来，水利建设获得了辉煌的成就，在很大面积的耕地上实现了灌溉自流化。为什么在水利条件较好的地区还有必要大打机井呢？因为他们作了调查研究，从对事物的具体分析中得出了这个正确的结论。河南全省的常年降雨量约一千二百亿立方，除去流往外省、渗入地下和蒸发等以外，能够引入水库、渠道的不到二百亿立方，只依靠这些水灌溉全省一亿二千万亩耕地显然是不够的。这是按正常降雨量计算的，如果发生天旱，江河水位下落，水库不能储进更多的水，问题就会更严重。我们今年的任务是争取农业生产更好更全面的跃进，要使这个伟大的任务胜利实现，就得在抗御主要的自然灾害——旱灾和涝灾方面，采取切实的措施，就得在农业的命脉——水上采取“双保险”的办法，既抓地上水，又抓地下水，才能够实现“旱涝保丰收”。因此，大打机井，充分利用地下水，是一个十分必要的措施。
    打机井是不是很困难呢？南阳地区的事实证明，有了党的正确领导和人民公社，这件事并不难，南阳地委大搞百万亩“机井方”就使机井打得既快又好。建立“机井方”不仅打破了县界、社界，使机井的布局合理，充分发挥地下水的作用，而且由于充分发挥了人民公社的一大二公的优越性，全面规划，也加快了打机井的速度。短短两个多月内，南阳地区就打机井二千九百多眼，而且眼眼合乎规格，这个速度还不快吗？
    当前北方几省都有春旱露头，这是在去年夏秋经过了一场百日大旱之后又出现的春旱，我们就更要认识它的严重性。当前正是麦田要浇灌返青水，春田待浇底墒水，需水量很大的时候。因此已有旱象露头的地区，大搞机井，不仅对当前春耕生产有极重要的关系，而且从解决长远的水利建设考虑也是十分需要的。
