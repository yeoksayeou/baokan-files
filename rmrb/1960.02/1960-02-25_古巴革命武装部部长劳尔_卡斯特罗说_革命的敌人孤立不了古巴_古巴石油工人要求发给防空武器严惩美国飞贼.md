Xinhua News Agency, Havana, February 24th: Raúl Castro, Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba, said here this morning in a speech: The enemies of the revolution are trying to isolate Cuba from Latin American countries in order to realize their plan to suppress Cuban independence; however, the Cuban people have the support of the people of all countries in the world because the Cuban people are good at adhering to the basic principles of their foreign policy: be friendly to everyone, but do not submit to anyone.

Raúl Castro made these remarks at a ceremony commemorating the sixty-fifth anniversary of the Baire Independence Declaration, which marked the beginning of the 1895 War of Independence. This war of independence against Spanish colonial rule was led by Martí, the national hero who liberated Cuba from Spanish colonial rule.

Raúl Castro said that the revolutionary government takes Martí's words as its guide. Martí pointed out: Cuba should move forward with the whole world, not stand with one part against another. Raúl Castro emphasized that Cuba did not achieve independence by relying on the United States; on the contrary, the United States intervened, preventing Cuba from achieving complete independence and replacing Spain's position by exercising semi-colonial rule over Cuba. He said that the United States' shameless intervention at that time was to serve the monopoly groups' occupation of Cuban land, mines, and trade.

He said that now the revolution has recovered Cuba's right to realize the way of life its people desire, and it does not recognize anyone's right to interfere.

Xinhua News Agency, February 24th: According to a report from Havana by the Latin American News Agency on the 23rd, the Cuban Oil Workers' Federation wrote to Major Juan Almeida, Chief of Staff of the Cuban Armed Forces, requesting the supply of anti-aircraft weapons and teaching them how to use these weapons in order to "deal with any attacks by American aircraft invading Cuban territory."

The Oil Workers' Federation, as well as workers and staff of Shell Oil Company and Cuban Esso Mobil Oil Company located in the area that was attacked, also sent telegrams to oil workers' unions in Latin American countries, requesting support. The telegram stated, "Oil workers are preparing to implement vigilance in the refineries to prevent them from being attacked." In a telegram to the American Oil Workers' Federation, the Cuban Oil Workers' Federation strongly protested the inhuman bombing of the Havana oil industrial area by pirate aircraft from the United States. The telegram said, "These bombings threaten the lives of workers and their families in the area."

    革命的敌人孤立不了古巴
    古巴石油工人要求发给防空武器严惩美国飞贼
    新华社哈瓦那24日电　古巴革命武装部部长劳尔·卡斯特罗今天早上在这里发表演讲说：革命的敌人正在企图把古巴从拉丁美洲国家中孤立出来，以实现其镇压古巴独立的计划；但是，古巴人民有世界各国人民的友谊支持，因为古巴人民善于坚持它外交政策的基本原则：同所有的人友好，但也不屈服于任何人。
    劳尔·卡斯特罗这些话是在纪念标志着1895年独立战争开始的巴伊雷独立宣言六十五周年纪念会上讲的。这次反对西班牙殖民统治的独立战争是由古巴从西班牙殖民统治下解放出来的民族英雄马蒂领导的。
    劳尔·卡斯特罗说，革命政府以马蒂的话作为自己的指南，马蒂指出：古巴应该同全世界一起前进，而不是跟这一部分站在一起反对另一部分。劳尔·卡斯特罗强调指出，古巴并不是靠美国取得独立的，恰恰相反，美国进行干涉，使古巴不能得到完全的独立，并且代替了西班牙的地位而对古巴实行半殖民统治。他说，当时美国的无耻干涉是为垄断集团霸占古巴的土地、矿山和贸易效劳的。
    他说，现在革命收回了古巴实现它的人民所希望的生活方式的权利，它不承认任何人有进行干涉的权利。
    新华社24日讯　据拉丁美洲通讯社23日自哈瓦那报道：古巴石油工人联合会写信给古巴武装部队参谋长胡安·阿耳梅达少校，要求供给防空武器并教会他们使用这些武器，以便“对付侵犯古巴领土的美国飞机的任何袭击”。
    石油工人联合会以及位于遭到空袭地区的壳牌石油公司和古巴埃索美孚油公司的工人和职员还发电报给拉丁美洲各国的石油工人工会，要求给予支持。电文说，“石油工人正准备在炼油厂中实行警戒，不让炼油厂遭到袭击”。古巴石油工人联合会在写给美国石油工人联合会的一份电报里强烈抗议来自美国的海盗飞机对哈瓦那石油工业区所进行的非人道的滥炸。电文说，“这些轰炸使该地区工人和家属的生命受到威胁。”
