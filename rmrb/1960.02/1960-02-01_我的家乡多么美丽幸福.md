    How Beautiful and Happy My Hometown Is
    舵莫奇夫, First Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party's Jibuhulangtu People's Commune Committee, Xinba Left Banner, Inner Mongolia

    Our happy hometown, the Jibuhulangtu People's Commune in Xinba Left Banner, is located in the northwest corner of the rich Hulunbuir Grassland. It is backed by Dalai Lake and borders the Urson River, a tributary connecting Bel Lake and Dalai Lake.

    Stand on the Ganzhuhua hills and look! The beautiful Urson River quietly flows into the fish-rich Dalai Lake. Dalai Lake glitters in the sunlight. On the banks of the lake and the long Urson River, herds of fat and strong cattle and horses of various colors and snow-white sheep graze. At the foot of Chulutu Mountain in the west of the river is a large fodder base. Looking southeast, neat bungalows and fences are distributed across the pasture like chessboards. Listen! Herdsmen of all ethnic groups sing the song "The People's Commune is Good" in different languages. What tremendous changes have the establishment of the people's commune brought to the grassland in the past year! Now let the facts answer!

    In November 1958, as soon as the Jibuhulangtu People's Commune was established, it encountered a test. That autumn and winter, there was little snow, with an average snowfall of only about three inches, and the lake water froze to three feet. What would the commune's more than 60,000 livestock drink with only seventeen water wells? Not to mention the distant past, in 1957, natural disasters caused the loss of 20,000 livestock. Now, drought has come again. But this time, it was different. The people's commune immediately organized a drought resistance team, and after five days and nights of hard work in the severe cold of December, they dug twenty-five wells, basically solving the problem of livestock drinking water. The people of the whole commune were excited, and many said: Human power can really conquer nature! Some added: "Without the people's commune, where could we have such great strength!" In early spring of 1959, before the earth had thawed, the people's commune went all out and dug nineteen more wells, realizing a well network on the grassland, enabling more than 60,000 livestock to safely survive the rare drought of recent decades. What is even more gratifying is that in 1959, the commune's livestock was no longer the more than 60,000 head of 1958, but more than 80,000 head, with a total increase rate of 26.80% and a net increase of 17%. At the same time, great achievements have also been made in improving livestock breeds.

    It has been a long-held ideal of herdsmen to live in warm and comfortable houses and for livestock to have solid and durable corrals. Now this ideal is being realized step by step at a rapid pace. As soon as our commune was established, it prepared materials, and after thawing, organized a basic construction team to build houses and more and better livestock corrals separately. By mid-October 1959, one hundred and twenty earthen bungalows had been built, and more than thirty herdsmen families had moved into new homes. The number of residential areas in the commune increased from the original two to five. Forty-five earthen wall fences were built around the new residential areas, more than double the corral construction in the past few years, so that more than 60% of the livestock had solid and warm corrals. The herdsmen proudly said: "With the people's commune, this is just the beginning. In another year or two, our ideals can all be realized."

    In the early spring of 1959, the people's commune organized ten plows to break the virgin soil on the grassland for the first time in history, and sowed grain and forage seeds on more than 1,100 mu of virgin land. Although there was a severe drought in 1959, the harvested grain and vegetables were basically enough for people to eat, and the forage was also enough to cover 20% of the needs. In terms of varieties, there were wheat, buckwheat, corn, millet, carrots, cabbage, scallions, beans, watermelon, cantaloupe, potatoes... greatly enriching the lives of the herdsmen.

    In the past, there were only a few leather craftsmen in our hometown, and it was necessary to travel one hundred to three hundred li to Zhalaier or Hailar to repair tools. After communization, six factories were set up to repair tools, process wood, leather, clothing, tinplate, and felt making, with an output value of more than 18,000 yuan. Leather processing and tool repair no longer need to go outside the commune. Forestry, sideline occupations, and poultry farming have developed greatly, with twenty hectares of trees planted, one hundred pigs and some chickens and rabbits raised, and sideline income reaching more than 220,000 yuan.

    With the great harvest in animal husbandry and the great development of diversified operations, the total income of the commune in 1959 reached more than 490,000 yuan, an increase of more than 50% compared with 1958; the average income of the members increased by 40%, and the average income per household was 1,000 yuan.

    With the growth of the people's commune, the friendship between the members of all ethnic groups has further developed and consolidated. In March 1959, Batu, a Mongolian member, fell from his horse and injured his thigh while herding. Zheng Nengwang, a Han member, passed by and immediately carried Batu back to his home, and ran to Ganzhuhua, forty li away, to invite a doctor to treat Batu. At the end of February 1959, the Han members of the Unity Team ran out of firewood after the snow, and the Mongolian members of the nearby two herding teams took the initiative to send more than thirty carts of cow dung the next day. At the end of March, the herding team began to lamb, but the sheds could not be rushed out in time. At this time, the Han members of the Unity Team came with big carts, and continuously pulled four hundred carts of grass, thirty-seven carts of reeds, and a large number of tree strips. Similar fraternal friendships of mutual assistance and common development are endless. Under the brilliant light of the people's commune, the members of all ethnic groups seem to be riding on swift steeds and galloping forward. The grassland is rapidly changing its appearance, and the hometown is becoming more beautiful!

    我的家乡多么美丽幸福
    中共内蒙古新巴左旗吉布湖浪吐人民公社委员会第一书记　舵莫奇夫
    我们的幸福家乡——新巴左旗吉布湖浪吐人民公社，在富饶的呼伦贝尔草原的西北角上。她背靠达赉湖，前傍贯通贝尔湖和达赉湖的支流乌尔逊河。
    站在甘珠花丘陵上看吧！美丽的乌尔逊河静静地注入盛产鱼类的达赉湖。达赉湖被阳光照得银光闪闪。湖畔和漫长的乌尔逊河的两岸，放牧着肥壮的各色牛马群和雪白的羊群，河西楚鲁吐山麓，是成片的饲料基地。向东南望，整齐的平房和栅圈像一个个棋盘似地分布在牧场上。请听，各族牧人用不同的语言唱出：“人民公社好”的歌声。人民公社建立一年来，给草原带来了怎样巨大的变化啊！现在就让事实来回答！
    1958年11月吉布湖浪吐人民公社一成立，就遇到了考验。那年秋冬少雪，平均落雪只有三寸左右，湖水结冻三尺，只靠十七眼水井，全社六万多头牲畜喝什么？远的不谈，1957年就曾因自然灾害，损失了二万头牲畜。现在旱灾又临到了头上。但是，这次不同了。人民公社马上组织起一支抗旱队伍，在严寒的12月经过五昼夜的苦战，就打出二十五眼井，基本解决了牲畜饮水问题。全社的人们轰动起来了，很多人说：人力真能胜天啊！有的补充说：“如果没有人民公社，哪能有这样大的力量呢！”1959年初春，大地还没有解冻之前，人民公社一鼓作气，又打出了十九眼井，草原实现了井网化，使六万多头牲畜安然渡过了几十年来罕有的旱灾。更可喜的是，1959年全社的牲畜已不是1958年的六万多头，而是八万多头了，总增率达到26．80％，纯增达17％。同时，牲畜的品种改良也取得了很大成就。
    人能住上温暖舒适的房屋，牲畜能有坚固耐久的圈棚，是牧民很久以来的理想。现在这个理想正在飞快地逐步实现。我们的公社一成立，就准备材料，解冻后，组织起一支基本建设队伍，分头动手盖房和搭盖更多更好的牲畜圈棚。到1959年10月中旬，就建成土平房一百二十间，三十多户牧民搬进了新居，全社居民点由原来的两个，变成了五个。围着新的居民点筑起四十五座土墙栅圈，超过几年来棚圈建设的一倍以上，使60％以上的牲畜都有了坚固温暖的栅圈。牧民们自豪地说：“有了人民公社，这仅仅是个起点，再过一、二年我们的理想就可全部实现了。”
    1959年一开春，人民公社组织十副犁杖，破天荒第一次划破了草原上的沃土，在一千一百多亩处女地上播下了粮食、饲料种籽。1959年虽然有严重的旱灾，但收获的粮食、蔬菜已经基本够人们食用了，饲料也够自给20％。在品种上，有小麦、荞麦、苞米、糜子、胡萝卜、白菜、大葱、豆角、西瓜、香瓜、土豆……大大丰富了牧民生活。
    过去，在我们的家乡只有几名皮匠，修配工具要跑一百里到三百里路，到扎赉诺尔或海拉尔去。公社化后自己办起了工具修配、木材加工、皮革、被服、白铁、制毡等六座工厂，产值达一万八千多元，皮革加工和工具修配再也不用出社了。林业、副业和家禽饲养业有很大发展，已栽树二十公顷，养猪百口和一些鸡兔，副业收入达二十二万多元。
    牧业大丰收和多种经营的大发展，公社1959年的总收入达到四十九万多元，比1958年增加了50％以上；社员平均收入增加了40％，每户平均收入一千元。
    随着人民公社的成长，各族社员之间的友谊进一步发展巩固。1959年3月间，蒙族社员巴图在一次放牧中，从马上摔下来伤了大腿。汉族社员郑能旺路过发现，立即把巴图背回自己家里，并跑到四十里外的甘珠尔花请来医生，给巴图治疗。1959年2月末，团结队的汉族社员在雪后没了烧柴，附近两个牧业队的蒙族社员知道后，第二天就主动送去三十多车牛粪。3月末，牧业队开始接羔，但棚圈突击不出来，这时候，团结队的汉族社员赶着大车来了，连续给拉来四百车草、三十七车苇子和大量树条。类似相互帮助、共同发展的兄弟友谊，是说也说不完的。在人民公社的光辉照耀下，各族社员好像跨上了千里骏马向前飞奔，草原在急剧地改换着它的面貌，家乡更美丽了！
