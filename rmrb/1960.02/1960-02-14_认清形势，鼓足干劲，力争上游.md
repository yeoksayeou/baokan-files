Recognize the Situation, Summon Up Energy, Strive for the Top
Zhang Yunlin, Secretary of the CPC Karamay Mining Area Committee

    Since its birth in 1955, the Karamay Mining Area has progressed with astonishing speed. Under the leadership of the Party and with the vigorous support of the people of the whole country, and with the help of Soviet experts, it has developed into a modern large oil field in just over four years. In particular, since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, a brand-new situation has emerged in the entire mine. In 1958, drilling footage was more than twice the total of 1955 to 1957; oil production was more than three times that of 1955 to 1957. In 1959, on the basis of the Great Leap Forward of 1958, even greater leaps forward were continuously achieved. Oil production completed the state plan 24 days ahead of schedule at 110.5%, more than two and a half times that of 1958; drilling completed the state plan 38 days ahead of schedule at 109%; and all other tasks were also completed ahead of schedule across the board. It was gloriously rated as an advanced unit and attended the National Heroes' Conference in 1959. Since 1960, we have achieved a comprehensive "red opening," and as of January 20, oil production, drilling, oil transmission, and oil refining have all over-fulfilled the ten-day plan. We have broken the "conventional" pattern of being relaxed at the beginning of the year and tight at the end, and relaxed at the beginning of the month and tight at the end, laying a good foundation for achieving a "red opening," "red every month," "red all over," and "red to the end." Over the past few years, we have had the following experiences in our work:

    Recognize the situation and strive for the top in everything. The situation includes all aspects, including the domestic and international situation, the political situation in various periods, important instructions and policies of the Party and the government, advanced experiences and advanced deeds of fraternal factories and mines, and experiences between departments of our enterprise, etc. We must clearly understand these situations. Only by clearly understanding them can we have a panoramic view of the overall situation, identify the direction and the mainstream, thereby clarifying the goals of struggle and appropriately arranging work. To recognize the situation, we must often explain the situation to the workers and explain the tasks to them, so that they will not be arrogant or complacent, and can have a broad vision and move forward forever. Take deep wells, for example. Great achievements were made in 1959, but compared with Sun Defu's well team in Yumen, it was still lagging behind. They completed a 2,200-meter deep well in 28 days with good quality and low cost, which is the highest benchmark for high-yield and high-quality nationwide. In order to learn from their experience, we organized 13 engineers, technicians, and well captains to study in Yumen. After returning, we promoted their experience, and everyone felt that their work was far behind the advanced areas, which further inspired their enthusiasm. The so-called recognition of the situation also requires frequent analysis of the favorable and unfavorable conditions in the work. Under normal circumstances, the favorable conditions are always the main ones, because our Party's guidelines and policies are correct, especially the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the brilliant illumination of the General Line. Of course, we must also appropriately point out the unfavorable conditions, mobilize the masses to seize the favorable conditions, overcome difficulties, and advance victoriously. Especially at important turning points, we must educate the workers to recognize the situation and shift from one central task to another. For example, in 1958, drilling was the center, and all other work served drilling. In 1959, oil production was the center, and we quickly explained the situation and tasks to the workers. In this way, we can shift quickly, well, and in a timely manner. For example, in March 1959, the Ministry of Petroleum, based on the situation of insufficient material supply, instructed us to concentrate our efforts to ensure key projects. We immediately carried out situational education among the workers, explaining the importance of ensuring key projects. Everyone happily and bravely accepted the various tasks assigned by the higher authorities and resolutely implemented them in actual work. Recognizing the situation and happily accepting the tasks will make us strive for the top in everything and work with more and more energy. When supporting key construction projects, many units put others first, drew out the strongest manpower to support key projects, and found ways to overcome the difficulties themselves. In order to recognize the situation and strive for the top in everything, we must often study and research the Party's instructions, policies, guidelines, and tasks in various periods. Over the past few years, we have deeply realized that those who often study the instructions and policies of higher authorities and thoroughly implement them can achieve great results; otherwise, their work will take detours and even make mistakes.

    Grasp the key and the weak links. Grasping the key and the weak links is a matter of leadership methods. In 1958, we focused on drilling, and in 1959, we focused on oil production, with all other work revolving around the center. If the central work is not completed or does not improve, other work will not improve or be completed. Secondly, we must often focus on high yield, high quality, low cost, and safety, which are the most basic, most common, and most frequent key and links. Some work, such as the six major links of drilling, extraction, storage, transportation, and refining, must also be closely grasped. When oil production cannot keep up, it will affect oil refining and transportation. Oil production then becomes a weak link. How to make oil production catch up becomes the key to refining and transportation. When oil production goes up, but transportation does not, transportation becomes a weak link. When the refinery is full, but there is nowhere to put the extracted oil, oil storage becomes a weak link. Therefore, timely detection of weak links and major key issues, fully mobilizing the masses, mutually supporting each other, and breaking through the key are extremely important issues. Therefore, in work, we must be good at grasping the key and the main links, that is, be good at grasping the main contradictions and solving the main contradictions. Regardless of the size of the unit, if the work does not distinguish between priorities and urgencies, main and secondary, that is, not good at grasping the center and grasping the key, then it is bound to be a chaotic bureaucrat, bound to achieve half the results with twice the effort, and lose direction.

    Give full play to the spirit of communist large-scale collaboration. Our mine is a comprehensive large-scale enterprise with multiple types of work, one link connected to another. Without the spirit of communist large-scale collaboration, it is impossible to complete the glorious and arduous tasks assigned by the Party and the people. For example, drilling and oil production. Without the strong support of the people of all nationalities throughout the country and Xinjiang, without the correct leadership of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry and the Autonomous Region and the Administration Bureau, and without the large-scale supply of a large amount of manpower, materials, steel, and models, it would be impossible for us to complete the tasks of drilling and oil production on our own. Promoting communist large-scale collaboration includes all aspects. There is national large-scale collaboration, large-scale collaboration among various factories and mines under the leadership of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, large-scale collaboration among many factories and departments, and large-scale collaboration among service departments, as well as large-scale collaboration within each unit, such as between well teams and well teams, and between workshops and workshops. Many units leave the difficulties to themselves and make it convenient for others, putting others first, greatly promoting the communist style. We must continue to do so in the future. As far as fraternal factories and mines are concerned, Yumen and other factories and mines have provided us with a lot of support in terms of manpower and materials. We also have the obligation to support new factories and mines at any time and anywhere in the future.

    Leaders go to the front line in person. Leaders going to the front line in person is an effective method we have adopted since the Leap Forward. The first type is the regular transfer of leading cadres to lower levels; the second type is the transfer of leading cadres to replenish the grassroots and strengthen the direct leadership of the front line of production; the third type, which is also the most frequent and widespread, is that leading cadres from all aspects go deep into well sites, workshops, construction sites, etc., especially wherever there is an emergency. Wherever it is difficult, they go there, sharing weal and woe, eating, living, and working with the workers, and caring about the lives of the workers. This often greatly encourages the workers. Recently, in order to rush to put the oil transmission auxiliary pipeline into production as soon as possible, the Construction Engineering Company not only had leading cadres go to the construction site in person, but also transferred a group of cadres from the offices to burn stoves, cook meals, and boil water for the workers. The workers said with emotion: "The leading comrades work with us and care for us meticulously. What else is there to say? We must complete the task no matter how hard or tired we are." The more arduous the work and the more urgent the task, the more leaders need to go to the front line in person. This makes it easier to mobilize the masses. The more the leaders care about the masses, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses. Just like fighting a war, the higher the morale of the troops and the more likely they are to win the battle if the commander can go to the front line in person, charge ahead, and retreat behind.

    Over the past four years, although we have achieved certain results in the development of the Karamay Oilfield, this is only a good start. With the development of industry and agriculture throughout the country and the rapid westward progress of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, the country has put forward new and greater demands on us. We must guard against arrogance and impetuosity, work diligently, and resolutely strive to achieve the greater and more arduous tasks of 1960.

    认清形势，鼓足干劲，力争上游
    中共克拉玛依矿区委员会书记　张云林
    克拉玛依矿区自从1955年诞生后，就以惊人的速度突飞猛进。在党的领导和全国人民的大力支援下，在苏联专家的帮助下，在四年多的时间里，发展成为一个现代化的大油田。特别是1958年大跃进以来，全矿出现了一个崭新的局面。1958年钻井进尺等于1955年至1957年总和的两倍多；采油等于1955年至1957年的三倍多。1959年在1958年大跃进的基础上，连续实现了更大跃进。采油提前二十四天完成国家计划的110．5％，等于1958年的两倍半多；钻井提前三十八天完成国家计划的109％；其他各项工作也都提前全面完成了年度计划，光荣地被评为先进单位，出席了1959年的全国群英会。1960年以来，又实现了全面开门红，截至1月20日止，采油、钻井、输油、炼油都全面超额完成了旬度计划。打破了以往年初松、年底紧；月初松、月底紧的“常规”，为实现开门红，月月红，满堂红，红到底打下良好的基础。几年来我们在工作中有以下几点体会：
    认清形势，事事力争上游。形势是包括各个方面的，有国内国外形势，有各个时期的政治形势，党和政府的重要指示、政策，各兄弟厂矿的先进经验和先进事迹、本企业部门之间的经验等等。这些形势，都是我们必须认识清楚的。只有认识清楚，才能统观全局，辨别风向和主流，从而明确奋斗目标，适当的安排工作。认清形势，就要经常向职工讲清形势，交代任务，使他们不骄傲，不自满，能够高瞻远瞩，永远前进。就拿深井来说，1959年获得了很大成绩，但与玉门孙德福井队比较就显得落后了。他们二十八天打完二千二百米的深井，质量好，成本低，是全国高产优质的最高标杆。为了学习他们的经验，我们组织了十三名工程技术人员和井队长到玉门进行学习。回来以后，推广了他们的经验，大家感到自己的工作比先进地区还差得很远，进一步鼓起了干劲。所谓认清形势，还要经常分析工作中的有利条件和不利条件，在一般情况下，有利条件总是主要的，因为我们党的方针、政策是正确的，特别是党中央和毛主席的正确领导，总路线的光辉照耀。当然也要适当指出不利条件，发动群众抓住有利条件，克服困难，胜利前进。特别在重要转折点，要教育职工，认清形势，由一个中心任务，转入另一个中心任务。如1958年以钻井为中心，其他一切工作为钻井服务；1959年以采油为中心，我们就迅速向职工交代形势和任务。这样，就能转的快，转的好，转的及时。再如1959年3月间石油部根据器材供应不足的形势，指示我们集中力量，保证重点。我们立即在职工中进行了形势教育，讲清楚保证重点的重要意义，大家就愉快、勇敢地接受了上级所交给的各项任务，并在实际工作中坚决贯彻执行。认清形势又愉快地接受任务，就会事事力争上游，越干越有劲。许多单位在支援重点建设的时候，克己让人，把最强的人力抽出来支援重点，留下困难自己设法克服。为了认清形势，事事力争上游，就要经常学习、研究党在各个时期的指示、政策、方针、任务。几年来我们深深体会到：凡是经常研究上级指示、政策并深入贯彻，就能取得很大成绩，否则，工作就会走弯路，甚至犯错误。
    抓关键，抓薄弱环节。抓关键，抓薄弱环节，这是领导方法问题。1958年我们以钻井为中心，1959年以采油为中心，其他工作都围绕中心转。如中心工作完不成、上不去，其他工作也就上不去、完不成。其次经常要抓的是：高产、优质、低成本、安全，这是最基本、最普遍、最经常的关键和环节。也有些工作如钻井、采、储、输、运、炼六大环节，也要抓紧。当采油赶不上就会影响炼油和输油时，采油就变成了薄弱环节，如何使采油赶上去，就成炼、输、运的关键。当采油上去了，运输又上不去，运输就成为薄弱环节；炼油厂吃饱了，采的油没处放，储油又成了薄弱环节。所以，及时发现薄弱环节和重大关键问题，充分发动群众，互相支援，攻破关键，这是极重要的问题。因此，工作中要善于抓关键与主要环节，也就是善于抓主要矛盾和解决主要矛盾的方法，不论大小单位，如果工作中不分轻重缓急、主要与次要，也就是不善于抓中心，抓关键，那就必然是忙乱的事务主义者，必然事倍功半，迷失方向。
    充分发挥共产主义大协作的精神。我矿是一个多工种的综合性的大型企业，一环套一环，没有共产主义大协作的精神，是不能完成党和人民所交给的光荣而艰巨的任务的。如钻井采油，如果没有全国和新疆各族人民的大力支援，没有石油工业部和自治区、管理局的正确领导，没有大批人力、物力、钢材、机型的大批供应，靠我们自己完成钻井、采油任务是不可能的。发扬共产主义大协作，是包括各个方面的。有全国大协作，石油工业部领导下各个厂矿大协作，很多厂、处的大协作，以及服务部门的大协作，也有各单位内部之间的大协作，如井队与井队，车间与车间。有许多单位把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人，克己让人，大大发扬了共产主义风格。今后还要坚持这样做。在各兄弟厂矿来说，玉门等厂矿不论在人力物力方面对我们支援很多，我们今后也有义务随时随地支援新的厂矿。
    领导亲临前线。领导亲临前线，这是我们跃进以来所采用的有效方法。第一种是领导干部定期下放；第二种是调动领导干部充实基层，加强生产第一线的直接领导；第三种也是最经常最普遍的，各方面的领导干部深入到井场、车间、工地等，特别是哪里紧急就到哪里去。哪里艰苦就到哪里去，与职工们同甘共苦，同吃、同住、同劳动，关心职工生活，这样往往对职工的鼓舞很大。建筑工程公司最近为突击输油副管线及早投入生产，不但领导干部亲临工地，并从科室抽调一批干部给工人烧炕、作饭、烧开水。工人们感动地说：“领导同志和我们一起干活，还无微不至地关怀我们，还有什么说的，再苦再累也要完成任务。”工作越艰苦、任务越紧急的时候，越需要领导干部亲临前线，这样群众就越容易发动起来。领导越关心群众，群众干劲就越大。正如打仗一样，指挥员能亲临火线，冲锋在先，退却在后，部队的士气越高，越能打胜仗。
    四年来，我们在开发克拉玛依油田工作中，虽然取得了一定的成绩，但这仅仅是一个良好的开端。随着全国工农业的发展及兰新铁路迅速向西进展，国家向我们提出了新的更大的要求。我们一定要戒骄戒躁，兢兢业业，坚决为实现1960年更伟大更艰巨的任务而奋斗。
