    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, February 8th: In recent months, many primary technical personnel training classes have been held in the Tibet region. More than 700 Tibetan and Hui students have participated in the studies.

    Since the feudal serf system was destroyed, various production and construction undertakings in Tibet are gradually developing, and the emancipated farmers and herdsmen are eager to learn new production technologies and culture. In order to adapt to this situation, various training classes such as agricultural technology, veterinary disease prevention, automobile driving, medical personnel, and primary school teachers have been held in various parts of Tibet.

    For most of the students studying in these training classes, it is the first time in their lives that they have had the opportunity to learn new knowledge. The Tibet Agricultural Training Class, located at the Lhasa Agricultural Experiment Station, has 101 emancipated farmers from all over Tibet. During their three-month study period, in addition to systematically learning agricultural techniques from seed selection and field management to harvesting, they must also learn to use many new types of agricultural tools and study the experiments carried out by the farm in the past few years in cultivating various crops on the plateau. This training class will end before the spring plowing, and the students are determined to apply the new technologies to this year's spring plowing production.

    Several veterinary disease prevention personnel training classes opened in Lhasa, Shannan, Heihe and other areas have already ended. After short-term training, the students generally master simple veterinary disease treatment methods and can work independently.

    西藏各地举办技术训练班
    翻身农奴钻研科学知识立志建设新家园
    据新华社拉萨8日电　近几个月来，西藏地区举办了许多初级技术人员训练班，参加学习的藏族、回族学员共有七百多人。
    自从封建农奴制度被摧毁以后，西藏的各项生产建设事业正在逐步发展，翻身的农牧民迫切要求学习新的生产技术和文化。为了适应这种情况，西藏各地先后举办了农业技术、兽医防治、汽车驾驶、医务人员和小学师资等各种训练班。
    在这些训练班里学习的学员，绝大部分是他们有生以来第一次获得学习新知识的机会。设在拉萨农业试验场的西藏农业训练班，有来自西藏各地的一百零一位翻身农民，他们在三个多月的学习时间里，除了比较系统地学习从选种、田间管理到收割的农业技术以外，还要学会使用许多新式农具，学习这个农场几年来在高原上进行试验栽培各种作物的试验。这个训练班将在春耕前结束，学员们决心要把新的技术运用到今年的春耕生产中去。
    在拉萨、山南、黑河等地区开办的几个兽疫防治人员训练班，有些已经结束。学员们经过短期训练，一般都能掌握简单的兽疫治疗方法，单独进行工作。
