　　"Volunteer Army Mother" Xian Zaifu's home was originally in Sepo County, Jiangyuan Province, North Korea, more than 100 kilometers away from Wonsan, but we unexpectedly met her at Wonsan Railway Station. It turned out that Mother Xian had made a special trip to welcome the Chinese comrades.

　　Mother Xian is forty-five years old this year, slender, but in good spirits, with a pair of very kind eyes on her apricot-shaped face. She was wearing a plain top and a black shiny long skirt, happily holding a basket of good pine nuts, a specialty of her hometown, to welcome us. In May 1958, Mother Xian saw off the Chinese People's Volunteers at Wonsan Railway Station, and today she is welcoming the Chinese journalists delegation in the same place. When she saw the Chinese comrades, the scene stirred her emotions, and Mother Xian could no longer suppress the longing in her heart, and thought of the Volunteer Army again. When we visited her, Mother Xian said bluntly:

　　"Under the care of the Workers' Party, I live a very happy life. Whenever I feel happy, I think of the Chinese People's Volunteers who shared hardships with us for many years. The longer the time, the deeper my longing becomes, and I can't describe the feeling." As she spoke, the old woman's eyelashes were wet.

　　At this time, the room was full of sunshine, and a pot of white chrysanthemums was in full bloom, making people feel how bright life is.

　　Mother Xian told us that her children grew up under the care of the Volunteer Army comrades. Her eldest daughter, Zhenshu, went to work at the purchasing station of the county cooperative after graduating from middle school, her eldest son, Zhenzhi, is studying animal husbandry at a technical school, and her second son, Guanzi, and her youngest daughter, Zhenshun, are studying at Xinping Middle School, which was built with the help of the Volunteer Army comrades. She works in the sericulture class of the agricultural cooperative. Every day, whether she is inside or outside the house, what she sees, thinks about, touches, and smells at home touches deep memories. The tiled house she lives in was built for her by the Volunteer Army comrades in twenty days before their withdrawal. As soon as she enters the house, she feels that the Volunteer Army comrades who helped her build the house are still lively and surrounding her.

　　Mother Xian also treasures some small odds and ends that seem meaningless to ordinary people, but are most precious to her. For example: worn-out military buttons, a broken knife, old military shoes stained with blood, a small piece of deteriorated soap, even a needle or a thread. Mother Xian said that these things were left behind by the Volunteer Army comrades who affectionately called her "Amani" during the war. Before leaving, the Volunteer Army gave Xiao Zhenshun some fried soybeans. Mother Xian found a small pebble in the beans and happily said: This is a Chinese stone, given by the Volunteer Army comrades. She treasured it, wrapped it in several layers of paper, and kept it all the time. After the Volunteer Army withdrew from Korea, who knows how many evenings and nights Mother Xian trembled as she opened these small packages, facing these small things, and shedding heartbreaking tears for a long time.

　　When we told Mother Xian that we could convey her remembrance and anticipation of our Volunteer Army, Mother Xian smiled and said:

　　"Our agricultural cooperative had a drought in 1959, but the harvest was still good. The cooperative's animal husbandry is developing rapidly, and the mountains are full of cattle, sheep, and pigs. The cattle sheds are still tiled houses, beautifully built. A primary school is being built, and the number of students is increasing. The children in the cooperative's nurseries and kindergartens all drink milk and eat milk biscuits. We also use milk to make butter. We could never have had this in the past, and farmers could never have eaten milk. In 1959, our agricultural cooperative harvested ten tons of pine nuts from the mountains alone, and the money sold was enough for all the men, women, and children in the cooperative to make winter clothes. Now, no one in the cooperative eats porridge, and their lives have reached the level of middle peasants. The old sow that the Volunteer Army gave me before leaving is the largest sow in our agricultural cooperative. After I sent this sow to the cooperative, it has given birth to three litters of thirty-one piglets. After the third litter of piglets was born in May 1959, the cooperative picked the largest one for me to raise myself. This piglet grew for half a year and was bought by the cooperative last month for eighty yuan. Please tell the Volunteer Army comrades that we are living a happy life, and I hope they will also arrange their happy lives well, and then, if they have time, please come back and see."

　　When Mother Xian said this, her emotions could no longer be calmed, and she put her hand on her chest, lowered her head and said: "Our life is better, but the Volunteer Army comrades have left. I just have a mother's heart that misses her children."

　　Outside the building window, the vast blue sea is setting off joyful waves for the fishing boats returning from afar. Respected Mother Xian, in her sea-like heart, waves of anticipation and remembrance of the Volunteer Army are rolling.

　　Mother Xian cried and said: "I have been with the Volunteer Army comrades since 1951. At that time, I was the women's director of Xinpingli and participated in supporting the front line. Our family often housed the wounded. I cooked porridge, peeled apples, fed them, and washed clothes for the wounded. During the most intense days of the Battle of Shangganling, I wanted to go to the front line to carry stretchers, but the Volunteer Army comrades didn't let me. So I took a large package of clothes from the Volunteer Army comrades and went to the river to wash them. When I opened them, there was a pair of pants without legs and a shirt without a chest, all of which were bloody clothes. The fighting was so hard and fierce, and the blood of the Volunteer Army comrades was really precious. After washing for a while, the small river turned into a river of blood. I thought: The most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people shed their blood on our motherland's land. Isn't this the same as our dearest people shedding blood! I washed and cried at the same time. At that time, twenty or so American planes came to bomb the village, and the wounded who lived in my house came to the river with crutches, calling me Amani like a son looking for his mother, afraid of being bombed. At that time, firewood was in short supply. I went to the mountain to pick up firewood, and American planes came to bomb and strafe again. The wounded in my house either拄着拐棍 or爬着从屋里出来,一直朝着山上喊我阿妈妮,叫我快回来。That's how it went for a few days. When the wounded were transferred to the hospital, they cried, reluctant to leave me. One wounded soldier said: Amani, I have nothing to give you, only this string of buttons. When you miss me, just look at these buttons. Now this string of buttons is still kept in my home.

　　"In 1953, when the counter-offensive on the front line was fierce, my family housed nine wounded soldiers. One day after breakfast, twenty-five American planes came to bomb the village. Zhenzhi, Zhenshu, Guanzi, my three children helped five wounded soldiers to the air-raid shelter. I carried them one at a time, four times in total. After settling the nine wounded soldiers in the air-raid shelter, Zhenzhi and I went home to get quilts. With a loud bang, the house was bombed, and we were buried by the smoke and dust and fainted. When I woke up, I knew very clearly that I had come to get quilts. I just used my hands to dig open the dirt on my head when I remembered that the Volunteer Army comrades were still in the air-raid shelter. I hurriedly pulled Zhenzhi out of the dirt and ran back to the air-raid shelter together. At this time, the enemy planes had not left yet, and the house was in a sea of fire. There were still more than sixty sets of clothes and more than seventy quilts that had been washed for the Volunteer Army, as well as three boxes of soap. These things were sent to the front line by the Chinese people from thousands of miles away, and we had to grab them! I led my three children,钻进钻出 through the fire, and rescued these things. I didn't have time to take anything of my own, and the house was burned to a pile of ashes. My hair was burnt, and blisters appeared on my hands and feet. When the Volunteer Army comrades saw that I was barefoot, they immediately took off their shoes and put them on me. That night, we had nothing at home, and the children looked at me with pitiful eyes. I spread some straw in the yard and sat in the open air with my children. The nine wounded comrades also crawled out of the air-raid shelter and sat in the open air with our five mothers and children. I said to the children: It doesn't matter if the house is bombed, it doesn't matter even if I die. Our Labor Party and the Volunteer Army will cultivate you. I am very relieved about this. When the moon just came up, a Volunteer Army officer personally brought five quilts and a rich dinner and came to my side. The officer comrade saw us talking in the moonlight and called me Amani and cried.

　　"A few days later, the local government prepared an air-raid shelter and asked me to live in it. The wounded comrades all came to stop me. They said: Amani, you should go to the air-raid shelter we prepared for you. I was very happy to hear this and followed them to see it. It was a large and beautiful air-raid shelter. There were windows, a kang, a mat on the kang, as well as clothes, quilts, furniture, sorghum and rice in sacks. This was the air-raid shelter that the wounded soldiers secretly dug for me. Some of them were disabled in their legs, and some were disabled in their arms. It was very hard to dig the soil, and calluses and blisters appeared on their hands. After the ceasefire, the Volunteer Army comrades built a new house for me, and I moved out of the air-raid shelter. The tiled house I live in now is the second house built for me by the Volunteer Army comrades. I just moved into this new tiled house when the Chinese Volunteer Army left.

　　"The day before the Chinese Volunteer Army returned to their country, I went to the army and saw that they had prepared many wreaths to bid farewell to the martyrs. At that time, the Volunteer Army comrades didn't let me go to the martyrs' cemetery, fearing that I would be sad, but I still followed them. I stood in front of the cemetery and listened to the Volunteer Army comrades saying: Dear comrades, we crossed the Yalu River together and came to participate in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. Today we are going to say goodbye to you. We are going back to our beloved motherland, but you are staying on this heroic land, forever immortal. After hearing these words, I couldn't help crying out loud. All the Volunteer Army comrades in the cemetery also cried out loud."

　　Mother Xian's retelling turned from sobbing to wailing. After calming down a little, she continued with tearful eyes.

　　"After the Volunteer Army comrades returned to their country, I thought about them all the time and missed them every day. I don't know their names, and I don't know which battalion or division they are in. Anyway, they all came from China and are our closest relatives. I often say to the children of the 'Minqing' (Korean Democratic Youth League) and the elementary school students: You should be grateful to the Volunteer Army uncles for being able to live such a happy student life now. The Volunteer Army uncles have created such good learning conditions for you! The students of our Xinping Middle School should all strive to be top students. Study hard, and when you grow up, contribute everything to the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. On October 25, 1959, I personally carried a large basin of wine dishes and offerings, and took some children to the Volunteer Army Martyrs' Cemetery outside the village to pay tribute to the martyrs. Newly harvested apples, pears, new rice, wine, fish, 打糕, and four kinds of green vegetables, a lot of food was prepared. I had been saving some flour that the Volunteer Army comrades gave me before they left, and this time I took it out and fried some fruit for the martyrs. As I poured wine in front of the martyrs' tomb, I said in my heart: If these comrades were still alive, they could eat a lot of things from me, but they have left us forever, and they can no longer enjoy our happy life. I cried all day, unable to eat or sleep. The children of the 'Minqing' in our 里 (equivalent to our country's township) often carry brooms to clean the Volunteer Army Martyrs' Cemetery, and then read newspapers, hold meetings, and study the internationalist spirit of the Volunteer Army comrades there. Snowing, raining, no matter what the weather, I go to the Martyrs' Cemetery to see them, pulling weeds, decorating flowers and trees, sweeping snow, like caring for my own children. Please tell the Chinese mothers about this and let them rest assured. One day at the end of October, when I came back from the field, I looked at my house from a distance and thought in my heart: Look, you have gone back and built such a good house for me! When will I be able to see you again? I took a sickle and walked to a chestnut tree. Just right, a drop of rain happened to fall on my face. I thought: These are the tears of the Volunteer Army comrades who are missing me. They are also missing me!"

　　Mother Xian's deep and passionate outpouring is a praise and remembrance of our country's Volunteer Army by the great heart of a Korean mother; it is a praise and remembrance of our country's Volunteer Army by the Korean people, the beautiful rivers and mountains of Korea, and every mountain, river, grass, and tree in Korea. Let the waters of the East China Sea forever set off endless waves of friendship for these emotional praises and remembrances!

　　We spent a pleasant day with Mother Xian. We ate at the same table and talked happily in the same room. Mother Xian peeled fruit for us, handed us candy, and persuaded us to drink and eat, her motherly heart as warm as when she took care of the Volunteer Army comrades back then. The difference is that back then it was in a shell-shocked air-raid shelter, and today it is in a banquet hall with bright lights, fragrant wine, and a table full of dishes. Mother Xian filled a glass of ginseng wine, stood up solemnly, and said: For the health and happiness of the Volunteer Army comrades! She drank it all in one gulp.

　　The next morning, in the misty harbor and on the dimly lit street, we said goodbye to Mother Xian. As the train started, suddenly a slim figure wearing a snow-white shawl and a black woolen coat rushed forward towards the slowly moving train. We looked closely and found that it was Mother Xian. She was standing on the platform raising her hand and constantly summoning us. Her frozen red cheeks were wet, and her kind eyes had turned into tearful eyes again.

    绵绵无尽的怀念
    西虹
    “志愿军妈妈”咸在福的家，本在朝鲜江原道细浦郡，离元山还有一百多公里，可是我们竟意外地在元山车站遇到了她。原来咸妈妈是专程赶来欢迎中国同志的。
    咸妈妈现年四十五岁，身姿瘦削，但是精神很好，杏圆的脸上有着一双非常慈祥的眼睛。她穿着素色上衣，黑亮的长裙，喜盈盈地挽着一提筐家乡特产上好松子，来欢迎我们了。1958年5月，咸妈妈在元山车站送走中国人民志愿军，今天又在同样的地方来迎接中国新闻工作者代表团。一见到中国同志，触景生情，咸妈妈再也压抑不住心头的怀念，又想起了志愿军。当我们访问她的时候，咸妈妈劈头就说：
    “我在劳动党的关怀下，生活过得很幸福。每当我感到幸福的时候，就想起了与我们多年共艰苦的中国志愿军。时间越长，我的这种思念就越深切，说不上是什么滋味。”说着，老人家的眼睫毛湿润了。
    这时候，满屋阳光充沛，桌上一盆白菊盛开，使人感到生活是多么明亮。
    咸妈妈告诉我们，她的儿女们都在志愿军同志的关怀下长大了，大女儿贞淑，中学毕业后就去郡合作社的收购站工作，大儿贞植正在技术学校学习牧畜业，二儿管子和小女儿贞顺，都在志愿军同志帮助修建的新平中学读书。她在农业社的蚕业班工作。每天出出进进，不管是屋里屋外，她在家里眼睛看着的，心里想着的，手里摸着的，鼻子里嗅着的，处处都能触动深切的记忆。她住着的那所瓦房，就是撤军前志愿军同志用了二十天时间给她盖起来的。她一进屋子，就会觉得那些帮她盖房子的志愿军同志仍然生龙活虎般地围在她的身旁。
    咸妈妈家里还珍藏着一些平常人看来似乎毫无意义，但是对她却是最为宝贵的小零碎、小物件。比如：磨旧了的军用钮扣，炸断了的小刀，带血的旧军鞋，变了质的小肥皂块，甚至一根针一条线也好。咸妈妈说，这些东西都是战争期间，曾经亲切地喊她阿妈妮的志愿军同志遗留下来的。志愿军临走前，送了小贞顺一些炒大豆。咸妈妈从豆子里找到一块小石头子儿，也高兴地说：这是中国的石头，志愿军同志送的。她宝贵地用纸包了好几层，一直保存着。志愿军撤离朝鲜以后，真不知有过多少个黄昏和深夜，咸妈妈颤抖着手，打开这些小包包，对着这些碎小的东西，长久地淌下碎人心肝的热泪。
    当我们告诉咸妈妈，她对我国志愿军的怀念和盼望，我们可以转达。咸妈妈这才笑了笑，说道：
    “我们农业社1959年有旱灾，但是收成还是不错。社里畜牧业发展很快，满山遍野都是牛群、羊群、猪群。牛舍还是瓦房，盖得漂亮。现在正在盖一所小学，学生增多了。社办托儿所、幼儿园的孩子都喝牛奶、还吃牛奶饼干。我们还用牛奶泡制黄油。过去哪能有这种事，农民哪能吃到牛奶。1959年我们农业社光是松子就从山上收了十吨，卖得的钱足够全社男女老小作冬衣。现在全社的人没有吃稀饭的，生活都达到了中农水平。志愿军临走前送我的那只老母猪，是我们农业社最大的母猪。我把这只母猪送到合作社以后，已经生了三胎三十一只小猪。1959年5月第三胎小猪下生后，合作社挑了只最大的给我自己养，这只小猪长了半年，上月给合作社收购去了，卖了八十元。请转告志愿军同志，我们的日子过得很幸福，希望他们也很好地安排自己的幸福生活，然后，有空的话请他们回来再看看。”
    咸妈妈说到这里，感情再也不能平静，手抚胸脯，低着头说：“我们的生活好过了，志愿军同志却走了。我就是有一颗母亲想孩子的心。”
    楼窗外，千里碧海，为远航归来的渔帆掀起欢腾的浪花。敬爱的咸妈妈，她那大海一般的胸怀里，正翻滚着盼望和怀念志愿军的波涛。
    咸妈妈边哭边说：“我从1951年开始就跟志愿军同志在一起，当时我是新平里的妇女主任，参加支援前线的工作。我们家常常住伤员，我给伤员熬稀饭、削苹果、喂饭、洗衣，什么都作。上甘岭战斗打得最激烈的那些日子，我想上前线抬担架，志愿军同志不让，我就从志愿军同志那里抱一大包衣服，到河里去洗，打开一看，一条裤子没腿，一件上衣没胸脯，都是血衣。战斗那样艰苦激烈，志愿军同志的血可真宝贵。洗了一会，小河水变成了血的河水。我想：中国人民最优秀的儿女，把自己的鲜血流在我们祖国的土地上，这不是跟我们最亲爱的人流了鲜血一样！我一边洗，一边流泪，哭着洗着。当时来了二十来架美国飞机轰炸村子，住在我家的伤员拄着棍子来到河边，像儿子找妈妈一样喊我阿妈妮，怕炸着我。那时候正缺柴禾，我上山拾柴禾，美国飞机又来投弹扫射，我家的伤员又是有的拄棍子，有的从屋里爬出来，一直朝着山上喊我阿妈妮，叫我快回来。就这样过了一些日子，伤员要转院，他们哭，舍不得离开我。一个伤员说：阿妈妮，我没东西送你，只有这一串钮扣。你想我的时候，就看看这几颗扣子。现在这串扣子还保存在我家里。
    “1953年，正是前线反击战打得激烈的时候，我家住着九个伤员。一天早饭后，二十五架美国飞机来村里轰炸。贞植、贞淑、管子，我的三个孩子分头扶着五个伤员去防空洞，我一次一个，背了四次。把九个伤员安置到防空洞以后，我跟贞植儿回家拿被子，轰隆一声，房子被炸了，我俩被烟土埋起来，昏过去了。醒过来以后，心里可清清楚楚知道，我是拿被子来的。刚用手扒开头上的土，想起志愿军同志还在防空洞，忙把身边的贞植也从土里扒出来，一起跑回防空洞。这时候敌机还没走，房子成了一片火海，里面还存着给志愿军洗好的六十多套衣服、七十多床被子，还有三箱肥皂。这些东西是中国人民千山万水送到前线来的，非抢出来不行！我又领着三个孩子，在火里钻进钻出，把这些东西抢出来。自家的东西什么都没来得及拿，房子就烧成了一堆灰。我的头发焦了，手脚也烧起了泡。志愿军同志见我光着脚，马上脱下自己的鞋子给我穿上。那天晚上，家里什么都没有了，孩子们都很可怜地用眼睛望着我。我在院里铺了一些稻草，跟孩子们在露天地坐着。九个伤员同志也从防空洞里爬出来，陪着我们娘儿五个坐在露天里。我向孩子们说：房子炸掉没关系，即使我死掉也没关系，有我们的劳动党和志愿军会培养你们的，这一点我很放心。月亮刚上来，一个志愿军军官亲自带着五床被子和丰美的晚餐，来到我的身边。军官同志看到我们在月亮地谈话，喊了我声阿妈妮，哭了。
    “几天以后，地方政府准备了一个防空洞叫我去住。伤员同志都来阻挡，他们说：阿妈妮，你应该到我们准备好的防空洞去。我一听很高兴，跟着他们去看，是个又大又漂亮的防空洞。有窗户，有火炕，炕上铺着席子，还有衣服、被子、家具，麻袋里有高粱有米。这是伤员偷着为我挖的防空洞。他们有的腿残废，有的臂残废，挖土很吃力，手上都打起老茧和血泡。停战后，志愿军同志给我盖了一所新房子，我才搬出防空洞。现在住的瓦房，已经是志愿军同志给我盖的第二幢房子。我刚住进这座新的瓦房，中国志愿军就走了。
    “中国志愿军回国的前一天，我去到部队上，看见他们准备了好多花圈，要向烈士告别。当时志愿军同志不让我去烈士陵园，怕我难过，我还是跟去了。我站在陵园前，听志愿军同志说道：亲爱的战友们，我们是一起跨过鸭绿江，一起来参加抗美援朝战争的。今天我们要向你们告别了，我们要回到可爱的祖国，而你们却留在这块英雄的土地上，永垂不朽。听了这些话，我就忍不住放声痛哭。陵园里所有的志愿军同志，跟着也都放声痛哭。”
    咸妈妈回述到这里，已经把抽泣变成哭号。心情稍微安静了些，她才眼泪汪汪地继续说下去。
    “志愿军同志回国后，我时时想着他们，天天惦着他们，不知流过多少泪。我叫不来他们的名字，也不知他们是哪营哪师，反正他们都从中国来，是我们最贴心的亲人。我常常向‘民青’（朝鲜民主青年同盟）孩子们和小学生们说：你们现在能过这样幸福的学生生活，应该感激志愿军叔叔。志愿军叔叔给你们创造了多好的学习条件！咱们新平中学的学生都应该争取当优等生。你们好好地学习吧，长大了好为中朝人民的友谊贡献一切力量。就在1959年10月25日，我亲自顶着一大盆酒菜供果，带着几个孩子，去村外的志愿军烈士陵园祭奠烈士。新收的苹果、梨，新稻米饭，酒啦，鱼啦，打糕啦，还有四种青菜，准备了好多吃的。志愿军同志临走前送我的一些面粉，我一直留着没有吃，这回也拿出来给烈士炸了些果子。我一面在烈士墓前奠酒，一面在心里说：这些同志若还活着，可以吃到我许多东西，可是他们永远地离开了我们，我们的幸福生活他们再也享受不到。我一直哭了一整天，吃不下、睡不着。我们里（相当于我国的乡）的‘民青’孩子，也常常扛着扫帚去打扫志愿军烈士陵园，然后在那里读报、开会，学习志愿军同志的国际主义精神。下雪、下雨，不管什么天气，我都到烈士陵园去看，拔草啦，修饰花木啦，扫雪啦，像关心自己的儿女一样。这一点请转告中国母亲，请她们放心。10月底有一天我刚下地回来，从远处望着自家的房子，心里想：你看，你们回去了，给我盖了这么好的房子！什么时候我再能看到你们呢？我手拿镰刀，走到一棵栗树下，不偏不正，一滴雨水刚好落到脸上。我想：这是志愿军同志想念我的眼泪，他们也在想念着我呀！”
    咸妈妈的这些深沉激情的倾吐，是朝鲜母亲伟大的心灵对我国志愿军的歌颂和怀念；是朝鲜人民，朝鲜锦绣河山，朝鲜的一山一水一草一木，对我国志愿军的歌颂和怀念。让东海之水，永远为这些动情的歌颂和怀念掀起绵绵无尽的友谊的波澜吧！
    我们与咸妈妈一起愉快地度过了一天，我们同桌进餐，同室欢谈。咸妈妈给我们削水果，递糖，围着我们劝酒劝饭，她那颗母亲的心完全跟当年照顾志愿军同志一样温暖。不同的是，当年是在炮火震荡的防空洞中，今天是在灯明酒香、菜肴满席的宴会厅里。咸妈妈斟满一杯人参酒，庄严地站起来，说了声：为了志愿军同志们健康幸福！一饮而干。
    第二天早晨，我们在白雾蒙蒙的海港，在灯光疏疏的街边，与咸妈妈告别了。列车刚开动，忽然一位围着雪白披肩，穿着黑呢大衣，看来瘦削的身影，迎着缓缓蠕动的列车，急急奔向前。我们仔细一看，原来是咸妈妈。她正站在月台上扬起手来，向我们不停地召唤。冻红的脸颊湿湿的，慈祥的眼睛又变成了一双泪眼。
