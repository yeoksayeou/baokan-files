    (By our reporter Jing Chang) The Chinese Communist Party's Hongshunli Street Branch in Tianjin closely integrates political and ideological work with organizing street residents for collective production and life, enhancing residents' class consciousness and ensuring the vigorous development of street industry and collective welfare undertakings.
    In conducting political and ideological work around production and life, the Hongshunli Party Branch pays attention to combining the educational work of the vigorous political movements with regular propaganda and education, and combining collective education with individual education. Moreover, in every political movement, political and ideological work takes the lead. For example, after the resolutions of the Party's Eighth Plenary Session were announced, the Party Branch quickly made a report to all residents, adopting various forms for in-depth propaganda. For residents who were busy with family matters and unable to attend meetings, activists would visit them at their homes, using heart-to-heart talks for propaganda. At the same time, they widely mobilized the masses through symposiums, discussions, reports, and big-character posters. Therefore, within a short period, a production upsurge was launched among the street residents, and residents were mobilized to put forward more than 1,500 suggestions for improving work and production. To strengthen the regular political and ideological work among residents, the Hongshunli Street Party Branch also established a Street Residents' Red and Expert School. Every half month to a month, they invite the district committee to give a lecture on current events, policies, or basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism. After listening to the lectures, they organize discussion by area and group.
    After the housewives in this street were initially organized to participate in production, their enthusiasm was very high. Without production rooms, they carried out production in the alleys; without raw materials, they collected waste materials everywhere on their own initiative. However, because they had just come out of their families and were not yet accustomed to collective life, many people could not go to work on time, some arrived late and left early, and were often absent. The branch then addressed these issues, adopting methods such as using "one key to open one lock" (finding someone with a good relationship with the individual to do ideological work), and promptly resolving ideological problems. On the one hand, they encouraged everyone's enthusiasm for leaving their families to participate in production and work, and on the other hand, they explained the difference between workers and housewives, introduced the organization and discipline of industrial workers, and helped the residents' committee gradually establish production order and various production and living systems. While strengthening collectivist education, they also took concrete measures to help them solve their practical difficulties. For example, they stipulated breastfeeding times and arranged for designated personnel to buy things for them. Considering the large number of trivial matters for housewives, the Party Branch also tried to arrange more spare time for women to take care of housework. Especially in winter and during the Spring Festival, considering that many women needed to take apart and wash quilts and clean their houses, the branch organized everyone to carry out mutual assistance, with those with fewer children helping those with more, and those without children helping those with children to take apart and wash cotton clothes, which not only solved their practical difficulties but also established a new atmosphere of collective mutual assistance.
    After the production was organized, many housewives did not know how to manage production, and some did not even understand the term "pick up goods" and were "too embarrassed" to contact work outside. Therefore, some production teams did the work when they received it and were idle when they did not, and production plans were often not completed. In response to this situation, the branch sent people to actively connect with processing channels, and at the same time, let those familiar with the business take them outside to provide individual help using the method of master teaching apprentice. When encountering difficulties, they promptly offered ideas and solutions, and constantly encouraged them to enhance their confidence in overcoming difficulties. After practical training, the teams that had failed to complete their plans not only found many processing channels and overfulfilled the 1959 production plan but also prepared for the production tasks of the first quarter of 1960. Usually, the Party Branch, in conducting socialist education for residents, also paid special attention to criticizing capitalist management ideas. For example, some people, in order to make more profit, were unwilling to hand over the produced glitter powder to the state-owned commercial departments for unified purchase and exclusive sales, but wanted to sell it directly to the units using the goods. After the branch discovered this, it promptly carried out education, thus establishing the correct production direction. At present, the products of most production teams are made and processed for factories, or made and sold exclusively for state-owned commercial departments, and production is entirely included in the city's plan.
    The Hongshunli Street Party Branch also conducts political and ideological work among the masses around organizing collective life and welfare undertakings. When organizing canteens and nurseries, many women looked down on childcare and cooking work, thinking it was not as "decent" as directly participating in production; others felt that they had already done enough childcare and cooking at home, and it was "too unpromising" to do this after participating in social labor. In response to these ideological problems, the branch convened various types of residents' meetings to explain that doing childcare and cooking work was a glorious task, and then organized residents to conduct free airing of views and debates. Through debates, the masses' awareness was raised, and they ideologically realized the importance of these two tasks. The comrades who were originally doing these jobs felt at ease, and the comrades who were not doing these jobs also volunteered to participate.
  　The Hongshunli Party Branch usually pays attention to the working methods of inserting benchmarks, setting up banners, and using advanced models to drive the backward. Gao Xiuzhen, an activist and probationary party member in the street, worked in the kindergarten, was not afraid of being tired or dirty, and took the lead in doing environmental sanitation work, turning a backward kindergarten into an advanced unit. The branch promptly summarized and promoted this experience, and launched a climax of challenges and responses in nurseries and kindergartens, improving the face of work.
    Hongshunli is the first street in Tianjin to organize street residents to participate in production. In June 1958, with the support of the Party organization, seventeen women in this street first organized production teams, public canteens, and nurseries. Under their leadership, the women in the entire street were quickly organized to participate in production, becoming a red banner in Tianjin for street women participating in production and vigorously developing collective life and welfare undertakings. After more than a year of consolidation and development, the number of people in this street participating in production and service industries has reached 1,050, and almost all street residents with labor ability have participated in work. Ten street production teams have been established, producing more than a dozen kinds of industrial products for industry and agriculture and the people's livelihood. Twelve welfare and cultural undertakings such as canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, libraries, and Red and Expert Schools have also been established. The income of residents participating in production has increased by more than 20 yuan per household per month.

    天津鸿顺里党支部政治思想工作深入人心
    千家万户高树集体主义红旗
    居民觉悟提高促进了街道工业和集体生活福利事业的发展
  本报讯　记者晶昌报道：中共天津市鸿顺里街道支部，紧密围绕组织街道居民集体生产、生活进行政治思想工作，提高了居民阶级觉悟，保证了街道工业、集体生活福利事业的蓬勃发展。
    鸿顺里党支部在围绕生产、生活进行政治思想工作时，注意把轰轰烈烈的政治运动中的教育工作与经常的宣传教育工作结合起来，把集体教育和个别教育结合起来。而且在各项政治运动中，政治思想工作都走在前面。如党的八中全会决议公布以后，党支部很快向全体居民做了传达报告，并采取多种形式深入宣传。有的居民家里事多不能参加会议，就由积极分子登门拜访，利用谈心方式进行宣传，同时结合座谈会、讨论会、报告会以及大字报形式广泛发动群众，因此在很短的时期内，在街道居民中就掀起了生产高潮，并发动居民提出有关改进工作改进生产的建议一千五百多件。为了加强对居民的经常性的政治思想工作，鸿顺里街道党支部还办了街道居民红专学校，每半月至一个月请区委讲一次时事、政策或马克思列宁主义基础知识，听课后，按片按组组织座谈讨论。
    这个街道的家庭妇女在最初组织起来参加生产以后，情绪都十分高涨。没有生产用房，就在胡同里进行生产；没有原料，自己动手到处收集废料。但是因为她们刚从家庭走出来，还不习惯过集体生活，不少人不能按时上班，有的迟到早走，经常缺勤。支部便针对这些问题，采取用“一把钥匙开一把锁”（找与本人关系好的人去做思想工作）等方式，及时解决思想问题。并且一方面鼓励大家走出家庭参加生产、参加工作的热情，一方面向大家讲清工人和家庭妇女的区别，介绍产业工人的组织性纪律性，并帮助居民委员会逐步建立生产秩序和各种生产和生活制度。在加强集体主义教育的同时，对于她们的实际困难，也采取具体措施，帮助她们解决。例如规定喂奶时间，以及由专人统一代买东西等。党支部根据家庭妇女琐事多的特点，也尽量多安排一些业余时间让妇女料理家务。特别是入冬和过年过节时，支部考虑到很多妇女需要拆洗衣被、收拾房屋，就组织大家开展互助，孩子少的帮助孩子多的，没孩子的帮助有孩子的拆洗棉衣等，既解决了她们的实际困难，又树立了集体互助的新的风尚。
    生产组织起来后，很多家庭妇女，不懂怎样管理生产，有的连“提货”这个名词都不明白，“不好意思”到外边去联系工作。因此，有的生产组收到活就做，收不到就闲着，生产计划常常完不成。支部针对这个情况，一面派人积极给联系加工门路，一面让熟悉业务的人带着她们一起到外边去，采取师傅带徒弟的办法进行个别帮助。遇到困难及时给她们出主意想办法，不断鼓励她们增强战胜困难的信心。完不成计划的小组经过实际锻炼以后，不但找到了很多加工门路，超额完成了1959年生产计划，而且为1960年第一季度的生产任务做好了准备。平时，党支部在向居民进行社会主义教育中，还特别注意批判了资本主义的经营思想，如有的人为了多牟取利润，不愿把生产出的闪光粉交给国营商业部门统购包销，而想直接卖给用货单位。支部发现后，就及时进行了教育。这样就确立了正确的生产方向。目前，各生产组的产品绝大部分都是为工厂制作加工，或给国营商业部门制作包销产品的，生产也全部纳入全市的计划。
    鸿顺里街道党支部还围绕着组织集体生活福利事业，向群众进行政治思想工作。开始组织食堂托儿所时，有许多妇女看不起保育工作和炊事工作，认为不如直接参加生产“体面”；也有人认为自己原先就在家里看孩子、作饭，都干够了，参加社会劳动还干这个“太没出息”。支部针对这种思想问题，召开了各种类型的居民会，说明做保育工作、炊事工作是光荣的任务，然后组织居民进行了鸣放辩论。通过辩论，群众觉悟提高了，从思想上认识了这两项工作的重要性，原来做这些工作的同志安下心了，不是做这些工作的同志也自愿报名参加。
  　鸿顺里的党支部，平时很注意插标杆、树旗帜、以先进带动落后的工作方法。街道积极分子、预备党员高秀珍在幼儿园工作，不怕累、不怕脏，带头做好环境卫生工作，把一个条件落后的幼儿园，变成了一个先进单位。支部及时总结推广这一经验，并在托儿所、幼儿园掀起挑战、应战高潮，改进了工作面貌。
    鸿顺里是天津市最早组织街道居民参加生产的街道。1958年6月间，这条街道有十七个妇女在党组织的支持下，首先组织了生产组、公共食堂和托儿所。在她们的带动下，全街道的妇女很快就组织起来，参加了生产，成为全天津市街道妇女参加生产、大办集体生活福利事业的一面红旗。经过一年多的巩固发展，目前这个街道参加生产和服务行业的人数已达一千零五十人，凡有劳动能力的街道居民几乎都参加了工作。办起街道生产组十个，生产十几种工农业和人民生活需要的工业品。还举办了食堂、托儿所、幼儿园十二个，敬老院、图书馆、红专学校等福利和文化事业九处。参加生产的居民每户每月增加收入二十多元。
