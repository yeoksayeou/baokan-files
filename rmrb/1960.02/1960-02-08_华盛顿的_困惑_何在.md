What is Washington's "Confusion"?
Ling Ming

American bourgeois newspapers have recently been debating how to interfere in the Cuban issue. Some advocate "tough action," while others advocate "restraint" and "caution." These public disputes among these strategists are no accident at a time when the United States is stepping up its planning for direct armed intervention. However, well-informed journalist Constantine Brown revealed in an article titled "Action Needed in the Hemisphere" in the "Evening Star" on January 26 that Washington's "decision-makers are confused about what measures to take to deal with the intolerable situation in Cuba," which is not without basis.

The so-called "confusion" means having "difficulties" in making choices and "doubts" about the consequences. The "Christian Science Monitor" described it as a "dilemma," which is what it means.

The arguments of the hardliners (let's call them a "faction" for the time being) are based on the following: First, the United States has the strength, including the "Organization of American States" controlled by the United States; second, the current regime in Cuba is not stable; and third, a desperate gamble should be taken, that is, not being afraid to take risks. The "Christian Science Monitor" editorial on January 13 stated that "to get rid of the dilemma, Washington must apply its powerful strength" and can "mobilize the moderate forces of the Organization of American States" to "restrain Cuba," which is the first argument. Brown said: "The Cuban people themselves are beginning to feel and hate the heavy-handedness of Batista's successors." Obviously, the "Cuban people" referred to here are the hidden and exiled reactionary forces in Cuba, which is the second argument. The hardliners also lack confidence in the above two arguments, but believe that "doing today what should have been done the day before" is "asking for trouble" and should take immediate action to avoid complications and increasing difficulties in intervention, which is how Brown sees it, which is the third argument.

And what are the arguments of the "restraint" faction and the "caution" faction (also let's call them a "faction" for the time being)? We can take Lippmann's remarks as a representative. In an article published in the "Washington Post" on January 28, he argued: First, popular support is stronger than strength, and the United States' aggressive policy as the center of reactionary forces is being "punished." "Our performance has always been to support the past and oppose the future. Now the retribution has come. Anti-Americanism wins popular support, and anti-Americanism represents progress." Second, the Cuban revolution is powerful. "This is a social revolution participated in by the masses of the Cuban people, and its purpose is not to find a new batch of rulers, but to formulate a new set of social order." At the same time, the "problem" that the United States has to deal with "is greater than Cuba." "This is a question of how a country treats the revolutionary movement in Latin America, of which Castro's revolutionary movement is a surprising but by no means the only manifestation." The Cuban government's insistence on resisting American intervention "is not only supported by the masses in Cuba, but also by the masses in many other countries in the hemisphere." Therefore, third, weighing the "stakes," the "risks" the United States takes by acting tough—the "political risks"—are very high.

The "Washington Post" agreed with Lippmann's view. In an editorial published on January 13, it wrote, "One should not create the illusion that the Castro government will give in to a wave of diplomatic notes—or that getting tougher will somewhat eliminate some of the seriousness of U.S.-Cuban relations." The "New York Herald Tribune" published an editorial on the same day, also warning the United States not to let the Cuban government "appear to be a martyr of North American oppression and interference," because "criticism of the United States has for some time been an effective weapon in the arsenal of political agitators in some Latin American countries." Therefore, they advocate that "we must carefully limit ourselves to solid foundations and specific issues," that is, be careful to avoid affecting the whole situation and causing a prairie fire of anti-Americanism. The "Washington Post" also believes that "a policy of toughness for toughness' sake will create martyrs, while a policy of restraint can ultimately make friends." "This seems to be more sensible than mobilizing the Marines, rapidly reducing Cuba's sugar quota, and showing ourselves to be as hot-headed as Castro himself."

What conclusions can people draw from this? Obviously, whether it is the hardliners or the "restraint" faction and the "caution" faction, they have something in common, that is, they must interfere and must bring down the Cuban revolution. It should be said that the latter faction's strategy is more sinister and vicious. Because, in today's era when gunboat and big stick policies are outdated, the use of "restraint" and "caution" strategies, a combination of soft and hard tactics, and a strategy of winning hearts and minds, are often regarded as a way to win without bloodshed. Take the statement made by Eisenhower on January 26, which Lippmann admired, for example, this statement is another typical sinister two-faced approach. On the one hand, it stated that the United States "adheres to the policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries—including Cuba," but it also said that "this policy is combined with our treaty obligations as a member of the Organization of American States"; on the one hand, it expressed "recognition of the right of the Cuban government and people to exercise their national sovereignty," but also said that the reforms carried out by Cuba should allow American citizens' "investment and work" in Cuba to "continue." The statement also used the "international communist conspiracy" to intimidate. Isn't this a very blatant provocative intervention step?

But this does not mean that the hardliners' adventurous proposition—the danger of military intervention—does not exist. On the contrary, the clouds of armed intervention are gathering over the Caribbean Sea. Planes from the United States continue to bomb Cuban sugarcane fields; large-scale military exercises will be held in the Caribbean next month. The "New York Post" signaled that the purpose of the military exercises is to "make it clear to the Castro regime and Panamanian nationalists that the United States can mobilize a large number of troops and heavy weapons to these countries within a few hours." At the same time, Eisenhower will soon visit South America to launch activities for armed intervention using the Organization of American States. Any paralysis regarding armed intervention will suffer.

In short, the evil wave of American intervention in Cuba, although sometimes rising and falling, is rising higher and higher. Although its strategies are different, the purpose of intervention is the same. How can the United States allow a revolution in its "backyard," let alone a small island nation right next to the United States actually become independent. But the situation is becoming more and more unfavorable for the interveners, and it is inevitable that they will be "confused." As long as the Cuban people dare to stand up straighter, then Washington will be more than just "confused."

    华盛顿的“困惑”何在
    凌明
    美国资产阶级报纸最近对如何干涉古巴问题议论纷纭，有的主张采取“强硬行动”，有的主张“克制”、“谨慎”。这些谋臣策士们的公开争议，发生在美国加紧策划直接武装干涉活动的时候，不是偶然的。但是，消息灵通的名记者康斯坦丁·布朗在1月26日的“明星晚报”上发表的题为“需要在半球采取行动”的文章透露：华盛顿的“决策者们对于究竟该采取什么措施来对付古巴的不可容忍的局面感到困惑”，这也不是没有根据的。
    所谓“困惑”也者，即有难以取舍之“困”，有担心后果之“惑”。“基督教科学箴言报”说的“进退维谷”，就是这个意思。
    强硬派（姑且以“派”名之）的主张的论据，一是认为美国有实力，包括美国控制的“美洲国家组织”；二是认为古巴的现政权并不巩固；三是认为应该孤注一掷，也就是不惜冒险。1月13日的“基督教科学箴言报”社论说，“为了摆脱进退维谷的处境，华盛顿就必须应用自己的强大的实力”，可以“把美洲国家组织的温和派的力量动员起来”“抑制古巴”，此即第一个论据。布朗说：“古巴人民自己正在开始感到和痛恨巴蒂斯塔继承者的强硬手腕”，显然这里所指的“古巴人民”是古巴潜藏的和逃亡的反动势力，此即第二个论据。强硬派对上述两个论据也有信心不足之处，但认为“现在才做前天就应该做完的工作”是“自找麻烦”，应该立即行动，以免夜长梦多，干涉日益困难，布朗就是这样看的，此即第三个论据。
    而“克制”派、“谨慎”派（亦姑且以“派”名之）的主张的论据呢？可拿李普曼的言论作为代表。他在1月28日的“华盛顿邮报”上发表的文章认为：第一、人心向背强于实力，美国作为反动势力的中心的侵略政策正在受到“报应”，“我们的表现向来是支持过去，反对将来。现在报应来了。反美就得人心，反美就代表进步”。第二、古巴的革命是有威力的，“这是古巴人民群众参加的社会革命，而且它的目的也不是物色一批新的统治者，而是制订出一套新的社会秩序”；同时，美国所要对付的“问题之大超过了古巴”，“这是一个本国如何对待拉丁美洲革命运动的问题，其中卡斯特罗的革命运动是一个惊人的，但决不是唯一的表现”。古巴政府坚持反抗美国干涉的“做法不仅在古巴得到群众的支持，而且还在本半球其他许多国家里得到群众的支持”。因此，第三、权衡“利害关系”，美国硬干“所冒的风险——政治上所冒的风险——是非常大的”。
    “华盛顿邮报”同意李普曼的看法，它在1月13日发表的社论写道，“不应造成一种错觉，认为卡斯特罗政府将在外交照会浪潮面前让步——或者认为变得强硬一些将多少消除一些美古关系的严重性”。“纽约先驱论坛报”在同一天发表的社论，也告诫美国不得让古巴政府“显得像是北美的压迫和干涉的殉难者”的身份出现，因为“对美国提出批评在一个时期以来一直是某些拉丁美洲国家的政治煽动家军火库中的有效武器”。因此，他们主张“必须谨慎地把我们自己限制在坚定的基础和具体的问题上”，也就是火烛小心，以免牵一发而动全身，引起反美的燎原之火。“华盛顿邮报”也认为，“为强硬而强硬的政策将造成殉难者，而采取克制的政策到头来却能交得朋友”，“这似乎要比出动海军陆战队、急速削减古巴的食糖定额并显示出我们自己像卡斯特罗本人一样头脑发热等做法来得更为明智”。
    人们从这里可以得出什么结论呢？很显然，不论是强硬派还是“克制”派、“谨慎”派，都有共同之处，即必须干涉，必须搞垮古巴革命。应该说，后一派献的计谋更为阴险、毒辣。因为，在炮舰和大棒政策过时的今天，运用“克制”、“谨慎”的策略，软硬兼施、攻心为上的策略，往往被视为求得兵不血刃而取胜之道。拿李普曼所推崇的艾森豪威尔在1月26日发表的声明来说，这个声明就是又一典型的阴险的两面手法。它一方面表示美国“坚持不干涉其他国家——其中包括古巴——的内政的政策”，但又说“这项政策是同我们作为美洲国家组织的一个成员所承担的条约义务结合在一起的”；一方面表示“承认古巴政府和人民有权行使他们的国家主权”，但又说古巴进行的改革应当使美国公民在古巴的“投资和工作”“继续下去”。声明还搬出了“国际共产主义阴谋”进行恫吓。这难道不是十分露骨的挑衅性的干涉步骤吗？
    但这不是说，强硬派的冒险主张——军事干涉的危险不存在，相反地，武装干涉的乌云，正在密布加勒比海上空。来自美国的飞机继续在轰炸古巴的甘蔗园；下月将在加勒比海举行大规模军事演习，“纽约邮报”发出信号：军事演习的目的是“让卡斯特罗政权和巴拿马民族主义者们清楚地知道美国能够在几小时之内调动大批军队和重型武器前往这些国家”。同时，艾森豪威尔即将亲访南美，利用美洲国家组织进行武装干涉的活动随之展开。对于武装干涉有任何麻痹，都会吃亏。
    总之，美国干涉古巴的恶浪，尽管时起时伏，却是一浪高过一浪。尽管其计谋不一，干涉的目的则毫无二致。美国岂容“后院”闹革命，何况是在紧邻美国的小小岛国居然闹起独立来呢。但形势越来越不利于干涉者，其不免有所“困惑”也就是必然的。只要古巴人民敢把腰杆挺得更硬，那末华盛顿又何止“困惑”而已。
