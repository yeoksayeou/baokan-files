    West Germany Intensifies Nuclear Armament

    After the West German Bundestag passed the decision to equip the West German Bundeswehr with nuclear weapons in March 1958, the West German government has been making every effort to accelerate nuclear armament. The pace is far ahead of other Western European countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

    According to reports, the West German Army has already built two U.S.-style "Honest John" missile battalions and one "Nike-Hercules" missile battalion. Two of these battalions are already combat-ready. In addition, the Air Force ground forces have also decided to establish six "Nike" missile battalions and several "Hawk" missile battalions. The West German Bundeswehr has purchased 288 "Honest John" nuclear rockets and 36 launchers from the United States, while the "Nike" missile launchers number at least 144. There are reports that West Germany will continue to purchase hundreds of rockets and even thousands of "Nike" missiles in the future. The West German government plans to build 276 nuclear missile launch pads on West German territory this year.

    The West German Bundeswehr is receiving training in nuclear warfare. The American "New York Times" revealed last year that "West Germany is preparing to leap to become a nuclear military power within this year. It will possess the trained personnel and equipment necessary to conduct a nuclear war." In fact, since the beginning of 1956, three to four thousand West German officers and soldiers have been trained in the United States to use missile weapons. In order to adapt to nuclear warfare, the work of reorganizing the army into brigades as the basic unit, which began at the end of 1958, was also nearing completion at the end of last year. Tens of thousands of West German Bundeswehr personnel participated in large-scale nuclear combat exercises hosted by the U.S. occupation forces last year.

    In West Germany, the West German Ministry of Defense and representatives of the arms industry are actively engaged in research and manufacturing of various rockets and missiles. The West German "German Rocket Society" has modern facilities in Bremen for improving and manufacturing rockets, and has been expanding the rocket launch base near Cuxhaven for many years to test "Wetter" and "Post" rockets. A rocket test stand suitable for the latest requirements has been established in the district of Oldenburg. As early as the end of October 1957, Friedrich Staats, the president of the German Rocket Society, said: "We are not only theoretically prepared, but we have actually tested the first stage of a space rocket." The "German Aviation Society," established last spring, has formulated a "1960-1962 Three-Year Plan." The hypothetical "photon rocket" is also listed as a project in the plan.

    After the Western European Union agreed last October that West Germany could manufacture atomic weapons and various missile weapons, West Germany's arms industry has more openly started producing weapons of mass destruction. Currently, there are 260 enterprises engaged in nuclear technology activities. Thirty concerns, including Krupp, Siemens, and Flick factories, have joined a business association called "Physical Science Research Association" in preparation for manufacturing atomic weapons.

    However, West German militarists are not satisfied with this. Now there are reports that West Germany will manufacture "Hawk" and "Sidewinder" missiles in "cooperation" with American companies. West German Defense Minister Strauss recently told the West German Aviation Industry Association that West Germany, in the "third stage of air force construction," will jointly produce medium-range missiles and modern air-to-air missiles with "allied countries." Now the largest American arms companies are pouring billions of investments into the West German arms industry, especially companies manufacturing aircraft and missiles. It is reported that American monopoly capital will invest ten billion dollars in the next few years. After Adenauer's visit to Britain last December, it was also decided that Britain would supply West Germany with "Blue Water missiles" and jointly manufacture various rocket weapons with West Germany. In addition, West Germany is also actively participating in the manufacturing of France's first atomic bomb. (Xi)

### 西德加紧原子武装

    西德加紧原子武装
    1958年3月西德联邦议院通过用原子装备武装西德国防军的决定后，西德政府就竭力加紧原子武装。其速度远在北大西洋集团中西欧其他国家之上。
    据报道，目前西德陆军已经建成两个美式“诚实的约翰式”导弹营和一个“奈克—赫尔克里士式”导弹营。其中两个营已经可以参加作战。此外，空军地面部队也决定建立六个“奈克式”导弹营和若干“隼式”导弹营。西德国防军已向美国购买的“诚实的约翰式”原子火箭有二百八十八个，发射台三十六个，而“奈克式”导弹的发射台至少有一百四十四个。有消息说，西德今后还将继续购买数百个火箭，甚至成千个“奈克式”导弹。西德政府准备今年在西德领土上建立二百七十六个原子导弹发射台。
    西德国防军正在接受原子战争的训练。美国“纽约时报”去年曾透露说：“西德准备就在今年之内一跃而成为一个原子军事强国。它将拥有为进行一场原子战争所必需的受过训练的人员以及装备”。事实上，从1956年初以来，已经有三、四千名西德官兵在美国接受使用导弹武器的训练。为了适应原子战争，从1958年年底开始的把陆军改编成以旅为基本单位的工作也在去年年底接近完成。去年好几万西德国防军并参加了美国占领军主持下的大规模原子作战演习。
    在西德国内，西德国防部和军火工业代表已积极从事于研究和制造各种火箭和导弹。西德的“德国火箭研究会”在不来梅拥有现代化的改进火箭和制造火箭的场所，并且多年来在库克斯港附近扩建了的火箭发射基地试验“韦特尔式”和
  “波斯特式”火箭。一个适合最新要求的火箭试验台在奥登堡县建立起来。早在1957年10月底德国火箭研究会会长弗里德里希·施塔茨就说过：“我们不仅在理论上做好了准备，而且实际上我们已经试验了宇宙火箭的第一级”。去年春天建立的“德国航空学协会”制定了一个“1960—1962三年计划”。假想的“光子火箭”也被列为计划的项目。
    去年10月，西欧联盟同意西德制造原子武器和各种导弹武器后，西德的军火工业更公开着手生产大规模杀人武器。目前从事核技术方面活动的企业有二百六十个。克虏伯、西门子、弗利克工厂等三十个康采恩都参加了一个准备制造原子武器的企业联合组织“物理科学研究协会”。
    但是西德军国主义者并不以此满足。现在有消息说，西德即将在美国公司的“合作”下制造“隼式”和“响尾蛇式”导弹。西德国防部长施特劳斯不久前对西德航空工业协会说，西德在“空军建设的第三阶段”要同“盟国”共同生产中程导弹和现代化空对空导弹。现在美国的那些最大的军火公司正向西德军火工业、特别是制造飞机、导弹的企业倾注亿万的投资。据报道，今后数年中美国垄断资本将要投资十亿美元。而去年12月阿登纳去英国访问后，又决定英国供应西德“蓝水导弹”，并和西德合制各种火箭武器。此外，西德也积极参与法国第一颗原子弹的制造工作。（席）
