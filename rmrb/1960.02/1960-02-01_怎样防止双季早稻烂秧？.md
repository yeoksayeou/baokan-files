How to Prevent Rice Seedling Rot in Double-Cropping Early Rice?
Wang Shuting

Every year in China, double-cropping early rice experiences rice seedling rot to varying degrees. This is mainly caused by improper timing of sowing and the impact of unfavorable weather conditions.

The Relationship Between Sowing and Meteorological Conditions

Determining the appropriate sowing period for double-cropping early rice is a relatively complex issue. It is related to local meteorological conditions, early rice varieties, seedling raising methods, soil properties, terrain characteristics, and pests and diseases, but the relationship with meteorological conditions is the closest. Chinese farmers have long determined the sowing period based on the twenty-four solar terms, such as "Sow during Qingming, no need to ask parents," and "Don't rush in February Qingming, sow seedlings early in March Qingming." This is a farmers' saying popular in rural Zhejiang.

If double-cropping early rice is sown too early, the temperature is too low, and the seeds take root, sprout, and grow leaves very slowly. Once a cold wave invades, it often causes severe seedling and bud rot. Occasionally, if no cold wave is encountered, transplanting too early will cause the heading stage of double-cropping early rice to advance, and the young ears may be damaged by low-temperature freezing, unable to flower and pollinate, forming white ears, which affects yield. Sowing too late can certainly avoid seedling rot caused by low temperature, but it will delay the maturity period of double-cropping early rice, affecting the timely transplanting of second-season late rice; at the same time, the flowering period is delayed, and the late flowering period will be affected by the "cold dew wind," resulting in empty shells and shriveled grains, reducing yield.

According to the biological characteristics of rice, the minimum temperature required for the germination of most rice varieties is 10 to 12 degrees Celsius. Therefore, as long as we seize the "end of cold, beginning of warm," with sufficient sunshine and the daily average temperature stable above 10 to 12 degrees Celsius, and estimate that the temperature will not drop too much afterwards, we can sow. Based on the above conditions, the average sowing period for early rice in double-cropping rice areas in China is roughly as follows: Guangdong, Guangxi, southern Fujian, and river valley areas of southern Yunnan are generally suitable in the first half of March, and can also start sowing in late February in warm winter years; the plains along the Yangtze River in the Sichuan Basin are suitable in the first and middle ten days of March, and the hilly areas are suitable in the middle and late ten days of March; northern Fujian and southern Jiangxi and Hunan provinces are suitable in the middle ten days of March; southern Zhejiang, southern Anhui, Hubei, and northern Jiangxi and Hunan provinces are suitable in the late ten days of March; the lower reaches of the Yangtze River (referring to double-cropping rice areas near the Yangtze River along southern Jiangsu and Anhui) are suitable from the end of March to the beginning of April. However, due to different weather conditions each year, especially the impact of cold air activity before and after sowing, the sowing period of early rice in the same area also varies from year to year.

The sowing period of different varieties of double-cropping early rice is also slightly different. Generally, Japonica rice is more cold-resistant than Indica rice, so in the same area, Japonica rice can be sown earlier than Indica rice.

In order to avoid the impact of summer typhoons on the maturity period of double-cropping early rice in the southeastern coastal provinces of China, appropriately advancing the sowing of double-cropping early rice is of great significance. From July to September is the month when the southeastern coastal provinces of China are most affected by typhoons and the number of typhoon landings is the highest. Striving for the maturity and harvest of double-cropping early rice before July can ensure both high yield and good harvest.

Measures to Prevent Seedling Rot

The causes of rice seedling rot in double-cropping early rice are very complex. It is generally believed that drastic temperature drops and continuous rainy weather are the main causes of rice seedling rot. Under low-temperature and rainy weather conditions, plant cell tissues cannot adapt to the low-temperature environment, and physiological obstacles occur; in addition, continuous rain, high air humidity, and lack of sunlight cause seedling growth to stagnate, and can also cause the breeding and invasion of cotton rot bacteria, aggravating seedling rot.

Effective measures to reduce or avoid rice seedling rot in double-cropping early rice are: adopting the seedling-raising method of moist seedling fields, combined with the setting of windbreaks, reasonable irrigation and drainage, and various agricultural technical measures, to change the thermal conditions of the near-surface air layer of the seedling fields.

The so-called moist seedling field is to keep the field surface of the rice seedling field moist, and then cover it with some plant ash, etc. This is one of the seedling-raising methods commonly used in the rice-growing areas of southern China. Moist seedling fields can allow seedlings to obtain more opportunities for sunlight exposure, increase the soil's ability to absorb heat during the day, make the soil surface layer warm up quickly and have a high temperature, and the soil is full of air, which is conducive to seedling rooting. According to the comparison results of several different treatments of seedling fields, the growth rate of seedlings in moist seedling fields is the fastest, and the degree of seedling rot is the smallest.

Setting up windbreaks on the windward side of the seedling field with the most wind direction can reduce the wind speed of the near-surface air layer, accelerate the heating of the soil surface, and alleviate the drastic temperature drop caused by the intrusion of cold waves.

Since water has a large heat capacity, when the air temperature drops rapidly, the temperature of the water drops very slowly and releases latent heat, so water has a good insulation effect. However, water has different insulation effects under different weather conditions: during the day, water can prevent the seedling field temperature from rising rapidly, so drainage and sunning of the field should be carried out during the day to increase the soil temperature; in low-temperature weather, or at night when ground radiation is strong and the temperature drops a lot, water can prevent the seedling field temperature from dropping rapidly, so water should be irrigated to protect the seedlings to prevent low temperature from causing seedling rot.

Seizing the "end of cold, beginning of warm, rushing to sow on sunny days" is an effective measure to appropriately advance the sowing of double-cropping early rice and avoid or reduce seedling rot. In spring, although the activity of cold air from the north has weakened, there are still small strands of cold air constantly moving southward, causing temperature drops and rainy weather. After the cold air passes, the weather improves, and the temperature gradually rises until the next intrusion of cold air, which may cause temperature drops and rainy weather again. According to the characteristics of airflow changes and the analysis of meteorological data, the two cold air masses are generally six to nine days apart and weaken each time. Therefore, all localities should, according to the general sowing period of normal years, combined with the weather forecast at that time and in the local area, soak and germinate seeds before the cold air is about to move southward; wait until the cold air has passed, the temperature has risen, and the weather is fine before sowing.

    怎样防止双季早稻烂秧？
    王树廷
    我国双季早稻每年都发生不同程度的烂秧现象。这主要是由于播种时期掌握不当，以及受不利气候影响所造成的。
    播种与气象条件的关系
    确定双季早稻适宜播种期，是个比较复杂的问题。它和各地的气象条件、早稻品种、育秧方法、土壤性质、地形特点和病虫害等都有关系，但是和气象条件的关系最为密切。我国农民很早以来就根据二十四节气来确定播种期，如“清明下种，不用问爹娘”，“2月清明不用忙，3月清明早下秧”。这就是流传在浙江农村中的农民谚语。
    双季早稻过早播种，由于温度太低，种籽扎根、吐芽、长叶都很缓慢。一当寒潮侵入，往往会引起严重的烂秧烂芽；偶尔没有遇到寒潮，过早插秧，双季早稻孕穗期提前，幼穗有可能受低温冻害，不能开花授粉，形成白穗，影响产量。过迟播种，固然可以避免因低温而引起的烂秧，但会延迟双季早稻成熟期，影响二季晚稻适时插秧；同时，开花期延迟，开花后期会受“寒露风”影响而造成空壳瘪粒，降低产量。
    根据水稻的生物学特性，大多数水稻品种的种籽发芽时所需要的最低温度为摄氏十至十二度。因此，只要抓住“冷尾暖头”，阳光充足，日平均气温稳定在摄氏十至十二度以上，而且估计以后气温也不致过于降低时，即可播种。根据以上条件，我国双季稻地区的早稻平均播种期大致为：广东、广西、福建南部和云南南部河谷地区一般在3月上半月为宜，暖冬年份2月下旬也可开始播种；四川盆地的长江沿岸平原地在3月上、中旬，丘陵地区在3月中、下旬；福建北部和江西、湖南两省南部在3月中旬；浙江、安徽南部、湖北和江西、湖南两省北部在3月下旬；长江下游（指江苏南部和安徽的长江沿岸附近双季稻地区）在3月底到4月初。但是，由于各年的天气条件不一样，特别是播种前后冷空气活动的影响，同一地区在不同年份早稻的播种期也有迟早。
    不同品种的双季早稻播种期也略有不同。一般是粳稻较籼稻耐寒，因而在同一地区，粳稻可以比籼稻提前播种。
    为了躲过夏季台风对我国东南沿海各省双季早稻成熟期的影响，适当提早双季早稻播种具有很大的意义。7至9月是我国东南沿海各省受台风影响最大和台风登陆次数最多的月份，争取双季早稻在7月以前成熟收获，才能确保丰产又丰收。
    防止烂秧的措施
    引起双季早稻烂秧的原因非常复杂。一般认为，剧烈的降温和连绵的阴雨天气，是引起双季早稻烂秧的主要原因。在低温阴雨的天气条件下，由于植物细胞组织不能适应低温环境，生理上发生了障碍；再加上连绵阴雨，空气湿度很大，阳光缺乏，秧苗生长停滞，还会引起绵腐病菌的繁殖和侵入，加重烂秧。
    减少或避免双季早稻烂秧的有效措施是：采用湿润秧田的育秧方法，结合设置风障、合理排灌和各项农业技术措施，以改变秧田近地面空气层的热量状况。
    所谓湿润秧田，就是使水稻秧田田面保持湿润状态，上面再盖一些草木灰等，这是我国南方水稻地区普遍采用的育秧方法之一。湿润秧田可以使秧苗更多地获得阳光照射的机会，提高土壤在白天的吸热能力，使得土壤表层增温快、温度高，土壤中空气充足，有利于秧苗扎根。根据几种不同处理的秧田试验比较结果，湿润秧田的幼苗生长速度最快，烂秧程度最小。
    在秧田最多风向的上风方设置防风障，可以减小近地面空气层的风速，加快土壤表面增热，缓和寒潮侵入时所引起的剧烈降温。
    由于水的热容量较大，当空气温度迅速降低时，水的降温却非常缓慢，并且放出潜热，因而水具有良好的保温作用。但是在不同的天气条件下，水具有不同的保温作用：白天，水能阻碍秧田温度迅速升高，所以白天应排水晒田，以提高地温；在低温天气，或者在地面辐射很强、降温很多的夜间，水能阻碍秧田温度迅速降低，所以应该灌水保苗，以防止低温引起烂秧。
    抓住“冷尾暖头，抢晴天播种”，这是适当提早双季早稻播种、避免或减少烂秧的有效措施。春季，北方冷空气活动虽已减弱，但仍有小股冷空气不断南下，引起降温和阴雨天气。冷空气过后，天气转好，气温逐渐回升，直到下一次冷空气侵入时，又可能引起降温和阴雨。根据气流变化特点和气象资料的分析，两次冷空气一般相隔六至九天，并且一次比一次减弱。因此，各地应根据常年的一般播种期，结合当时当地的天气预报，在冷空气将要南下以前浸种、催芽；等冷空气过后，气温回升，天气晴好时播种。
