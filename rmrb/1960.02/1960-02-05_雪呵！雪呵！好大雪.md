Snow, oh, snow! Such heavy snow, a vast expanse of snow covers the land.
　　Snow, oh, snow! Such heavy snow, a group of people are coming!
　　The old director of the commune walks in front, his breath forming white clouds as he speaks and laughs:
　　Old Heaven, comrade! Keep snowing, I'll collect all this auspicious snow!
　　A group of young people behind him, listening, listening, burst into laughter…
　　The director, oh! Stroking his beard, walking along and saying:
　　In the old society, the days were bitter, one winter it was snowing.
　　The more it snowed, the more tears flowed, snow and tears, oh, tears and snow.
　　Back then, gazing at the all-encompassing snow, the whole family was starving, eyes blurring.
　　Eyes blurring, oh! Begging Old Heaven, only to see snowflakes silently falling.
　　Back then, Erzhu was still small, pulling his mother and asking his mother:
　　Mom, oh Mom, listen to me, why does Old Heaven only send snow?
　　If the white snow turned into white flour, Mom! Wouldn't that be wonderful!
　　The director turns to look at his son, only to see Erzhu a little shy.
　　A group of people, oh! Teasing Erzhu, wind and snowflakes hitting their faces.
　　Now, oh! It's different, the bitter days have become sweet days.
　　More snow, more grain, the commune is big, all of China is blooming with this flower of happiness.
　　White snow, white snow, drifting with all its might, making this old man's heart happy.
　　Heavy snow falling on our commune's land, this white rice, white flour is pouring down.
　　Ha! Ha! Let's go! Haha, a group of people walks away…
　　Snow, oh, snow! Covers the land, people pass, footprints buried by the snow.
　　The director leads people to survey new canals, busy with water conservancy in the harsh winter.

    雪呵！雪呵！好大雪
    李春雪呵！雪呵！好大雪，茫茫大雪弥天下。雪呵！雪呵！好大雪，一群人儿走来啦！老社长，头里走，口吐白气说笑话：老天同志！你下吧，全部瑞雪我收啦！后边一群年青人，听着，听着笑开啦……社长他呵！胡子摸，一边走呵一边说：旧社会，苦日月，有年冬天正落雪。雪越大，泪越多，雪和泪呵，泪和雪。那时望着弥天雪，一家子饿的眼发花。眼发花呵！求老天，只见雪花无声下。那时二柱还小哩，拉住他妈问他妈：妈呵妈，你听我说，为啥老天只下雪。要是白雪变白面，妈！你说这该多好呵！社长回头望儿子，只见二柱有点羞答答。一群人呵！逗二柱，风夹雪花迎面扑。如今呵！不同啦，苦日月变成了甜日月。雪多，粮多，公社大，全中国开遍了这幸福花。白雪，白雪，一劲儿地飘，飘的我老头儿心里乐。大雪落咱公社地，这白米、白面往下泼。哈！哈！走哇！哈哈，一群人走远啦……雪呵！雪呵！弥天下，人过足印雪淹没。社长带人勘新渠，严冬正忙水利化。
