Xinhua News Agency, February 27th: Buenos Aires dispatch: After Eisenhower arrived at an airport in the suburbs of the Argentine capital yesterday, he dared not take a car into the city, but took a helicopter from the airport to the residence of the American ambassador in Buenos Aires, in order to bypass the industrial area in the southwest suburbs of Buenos Aires where anti-American demonstrations were expected to occur. However, despite this, he was still met with anti-American mass demonstrations.

Demonstrators wrote large slogans along the road from the airport to the city that read, "Eisenhower, get out!" When the American president's helicopter flew overhead, angry crowds shook their fists at the helicopter carrying Eisenhower in protest. The police threw tear gas to disperse the demonstrating crowds.

When Eisenhower traveled from the American embassy to the Argentine presidential palace by car, eight teams of motorcycle police and an Argentine cavalry unit led the way for the American president's car. When Eisenhower returned to the embassy after delivering a speech to the Argentine Congress, the masses continued to demonstrate.

That evening, the Argentine Socialist Party held a mass rally to protest Eisenhower's visit. After the meeting, the masses participating in the rally tore down some American flags in the bustling city area.

Nine hours before Eisenhower arrived in the Argentine capital, five explosions occurred in the downtown area of Buenos Aires, damaging an American chemical company and the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange. These explosions added to the tense atmosphere in the Argentine capital.

    振臂高呼滚回去　闹市怒撕美国旗
    阿根廷人民向艾森豪威尔示威
    据新华社27日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：艾森豪威尔昨天到达阿根廷首都的郊区机场后，不敢乘汽车进城，而乘坐直升飞机从飞机场飞到布宜诺斯艾利斯市内美国大使的寓所，以便绕过预料会发生反美示威的布宜诺斯艾利斯西南郊的工业区。但是尽管如此，他还是遭到了反对美国的群众示威。
    示威者在从机场到市内的公路上沿途写下了“艾森豪威尔滚回去！”的大字标语。当美国总统的直升飞机飞过上空时，愤怒的群众对着艾森豪威尔乘坐的直升飞机挥舞拳头表示抗议。警察投掷了催泪弹来驱散示威群众。
    当艾森豪威尔从美国大使馆乘汽车前往阿根廷总统府时，有八队乘摩托车的警察和阿根廷骑兵队走在美国总统汽车的前面为他开路。当艾森豪威尔前往阿根廷国会发表演说后回到大使馆时，群众还在继续举行示威。
    当晚阿根廷社会党举行了一次群众大会，抗议艾森豪威尔的访问。参加大会的群众会后在热闹市区扯下了一些美国国旗。
    在艾森豪威尔到达阿根廷首都的九小时以前，在布宜诺斯艾利斯的市区里曾经发生五次爆炸，炸坏了一家美国化学公司和布宜诺斯艾利斯股票交易所。这些爆炸事件增加了阿根廷首都的紧张气氛。
