Raise People, Equipment, and Management Simultaneously
    Technical Innovation Movement Fully Developed in Erdaohezi District, Changchun

    (Our report) The "Production Renovation" movement, universally carried out in factories in Changchun's Erdaohezi District, has accelerated the process of technical transformation in small and medium-sized enterprises.

    The main characteristic of the "Production Renovation" movement is the combination of technological innovation and enterprise management reform, as well as the combination of technological equipment innovation and the improvement of workers' technical skills. This allows equipment innovation, enterprise management reform, and the improvement of workers' technical skills to promote each other, achieving the goal of comprehensively improving production levels.

    Erdaohezi District is a concentration of local industry in Changchun, with more than 30 small and medium-sized enterprises, most of which are old factories from before liberation. In recent years, after reconstruction and expansion, the technical level has been greatly improved. However, the proportion of mechanization and semi-mechanization only accounts for 41.8%, and manual operation still accounts for 58.2%. In order to accelerate the technical transformation of these enterprises, the Erdaohezi District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Changchun led the district to launch the "Production Renovation" movement in early November last year.

    In the past three months, the spearhead of the movement has been tightly directed at manual operations, and the vast number of workers have been engaged in mechanization and semi-mechanization on a large scale. Forgers in more than ten mechanical factories have discarded sledgehammers and used mechanized and semi-mechanized tools such as double spring hammers and splint hammers. The Changchun Automobile Parts Factory transformed its old-style belt machine tools, which had been in use for three or forty years, into new full-gear machine tools, doubling efficiency. In the past, the female workers of the asbestos rope group of the Changchun Asbestos Factory used manual operation, and each person traveled a total of seventy li between ten processes per shift; now the workers have created a twisting machine, and they can operate it by sitting next to the machine.

    According to statistics, from the beginning of the movement to early February this year, a total of three months, employees have put forward more than 124,400 rationalization proposals, of which more than 71,500 have been implemented, increasing the proportion of mechanized and semi-mechanized operations in the district's industrial sector to 60.4%. Without adding manpower or increasing foreign equipment, the district's production level in early February increased by 19% compared with early November last year, and the production plan was overfulfilled every ten days.

    During the "Production Renovation" movement, each factory grasped both the transformation of "things" (equipment) and the improvement of "people," setting off a wave of learning new technologies among employees. Many factories, through various forms such as tutoring teams, service teams, technology promotion teams, and experience dissemination teams, popularized new technologies, promoted advanced experiences, and promoted the rapid improvement of production levels. At present, more than 1,500 workers in the district who have just escaped manual operations have mastered or are relatively skilled in mechanical operation. More than 800 new workers who entered the factory in 1958 (half of whom were originally housewives) not only improved their technical level but also participated in technological innovation together with veteran workers, becoming an active force in the movement. The innovation of technical equipment and the improvement of workers' technical level complemented each other, promoting the rapid improvement of labor productivity.

    In the "Production Renovation" movement, the Party organizations of each factory also grasped both technical innovation and the reform of enterprise management. They led the staff of the offices to actively adapt to the requirements of production changes, actively improve enterprise management, and closely integrate technical innovation and enterprise management reform, preventing the phenomenon of only paying attention to technical innovation and neglecting management work, with workshops bustling and offices deserted, and rapid changes in production but stagnant management work. Most factories launched a "business renovation" movement among office staff. Many office staff went to the workshops and, together with the workers, revised process regulations and operating procedures based on the new experience of technological innovation. In order to provide favorable conditions for the full implementation of mechanization and assembly line operations, the technical personnel of the Changchun Metrology and Measurement Factory absorbed the opinions of the masses of workers and promoted standard design in thirteen products, simplifying the 9,276 processes of three products, three-ton, five-ton, and ten-ton underground scales, to 3,480 processes, reducing the required man-hours from 554 to 310, thus pushing the factory's technical management work to a new stage. The Changchun Automobile Parts Factory implemented a three-level plan and three-level dispatching system for the factory, workshop, and team, breaking the small circle of a few people who controlled planning management and dispatching work and turning it into a mass work. This made the planning more meticulous, and the tools and raw materials needed daily, every ten days, and every month could be quickly allocated, adapting to the requirements of increased production efficiency after the degree of mechanization was improved.

    The Jilin Provincial Party Committee and the Changchun Municipal Party Committee attach great importance to the "Production Renovation" movement in Erdaohezi District, believing that this is a new form of accelerating the technical transformation of enterprises. Not long ago, the Provincial Party Committee held an on-site meeting to promote this experience throughout the province.

    人　设备　管理　一齐提高
    长春二道河子区技术革新运动全面发展
    本报讯　长春市二道河子区各工厂普遍开展“生产翻新”运动，加速了中小型企业技术改造的进程。
    “生产翻新”运动的主要特点是：把生产技术的革新和企业管理的改革结合起来，把革新技术装备和提高工人技术水平结合起来。这样便使设备的革新、企业管理的改革和工人技术水平的提高三者互相促进，达到全面提高生产水平的目的。
    二道河子区是长春市地方工业集中的地方，共有三十多家中小型企业，大部分是解放前的旧厂子。几年来，经过改建和扩建，技术水平已有很大提高。但是，机械化和半机械化的比重只占41．8％，手工操作比重仍占58．2％。为了在技术上加速改造这些企业，中共长春市二道河子区委在去年11月上旬领导全区开展了“生产翻新”运动。
    三个月来，运动的矛头紧紧指向手工操作，广大工人大搞机械化和半机械化。十余家机械工厂的锻工，扔掉大锤，使用了双簧锤、夹板锤等机械化和半机械化的工具。长春市汽车配件厂把使用了三、四十年的旧式皮带机床改造为新式全齿机床，效率提高一倍。长春市石绵厂石绵绳小组的女工们，过去用手工操作，每人每班往返于十道工序之间的路程共达七十里；现在工人们创造了合股机，只要坐在机器旁，就可以操作了。
    据统计，从运动开始到今年2月上旬共三个月时间，职工们已提出十二万四千四百多件合理化建议，其中已实现七万一千五百多件，使全区工业部门机械化和半机械化操作的比重提高到60．4％。在不添人、不增洋设备的条件下，全区2月上旬的生产水平比去年11月上旬提高19％，生产计划旬旬超额完成。
    在“生产翻新”运动中，各厂都一手抓“物”（设备）的改造，一手抓“人”的提高，在职工中掀起了学习新技术的热潮。许多厂通过辅导队、服务队、技术推广队、经验传播队等多种形式，普及新技术，推广先进经验，促进生产水平迅速提高。目前，全区一千五百多名刚刚摆脱了手工操作的工人已经熟练或比较熟练地掌握了机械操作。1958年入厂的八百多名新工人（其中半数原来是家庭妇女），不仅提高了技术水平，而且和老工人一道参加技术革新，成为运动中的一支积极力量。技术装备的革新和工人技术水平的提高，相辅相成，促进了劳动生产率的迅速提高。
    在“生产翻新”运动中，各厂的党组织还一手抓技术革新，一手抓企业管理的改革。他们领导科室人员主动地适应生产变革的要求，积极改进企业管理工作，使技术革新和企业管理的改革紧密结合，防止了只顾技术革新，放松管理工作，车间热热闹闹，科室冷冷清清，生产迅速变革、管理工作停滞不前的现象。大部分工厂在科室人员中开展了“业务翻新”运动。许多科室人员下车间，和工人一道，根据技术革新的新经验，修订工艺规程和操作规程。长春市度量衡厂的技术人员为给全面实行机械化和流水作业提供有利条件，吸收工人群众的意见，在十三种产品中推行了标准设计，把三吨、五吨、十吨地中衡三种产品的九千二百七十六道工序简化为三千四百八十道工序，使需要的工时由五百五十四个减少到三百一十个，因而把全厂的技术管理工作推上了一个新阶段。长春市汽车配件厂实行厂、车间、小组三级计划、三级调度的制度，打破了少数人掌握计划管理和调度工作的小圈子，使之变为群众性的工作。这样就使计划编制更为周密，使每日、每旬、每月所需要的工具和原材料能够迅速调拨，适应了机械化程度提高以后生产效率提高的要求。
    中共吉林省委和长春市委十分重视二道河子区的“生产翻新”运动，认为这是加速企业技术改造的新形式。不久以前，省委召开现场会议，向全省推广了这一经验。
