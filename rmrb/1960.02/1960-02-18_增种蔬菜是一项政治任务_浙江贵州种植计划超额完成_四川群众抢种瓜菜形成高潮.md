Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, February 17th: People's communes in the suburbs of Zhejiang's cities and rural areas are seizing the time, using all available gaps and idle land to rush to plant late-spring vegetables such as spinach, radishes, cabbage, and mustard greens. Currently, the province has exceeded its planting plan, and the vegetable sowing area in many regions has significantly expanded compared to the same period last year, with a general increase in varieties as well.

The suburbs and industrial and mining areas of cities such as Hangzhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Jinhua, Huzhou, and Xin'anjiang are all striving to expand the planting of late-spring vegetables based on the principle of local production and local supply, aiming to have a large quantity of fresh vegetables on the market in April and May, turning the usual off-season for vegetable supply into a peak season. The late-spring vegetable planting area in the suburbs of Jinhua City this year has reached more than 3,000 mu, an increase of more than 30% compared to the same period last year; the greenhouse vegetable planting area has also nearly doubled compared to last year.

Public canteens of people's communes throughout the province have actively utilized corners of fields, roadsides, riversides, and intercropping methods to rush to plant more than 400,000 mu of late-spring vegetables. Many communes have also put forward the slogan of "not letting go of an inch of land, taking advantage of every gap," launching a movement of everyone participating and every household planting vegetables to ensure that the canteens have a variety of vegetables in sufficient quantity and that pigs have enough green fodder. After the Qinguang Commune in the suburbs of Ningbo City launched a campaign for each member to plant 50 pumpkin seedlings, the entire commune quickly planted more than 200,000 pumpkin seedlings.

This year, Party committees and relevant leading departments at all levels in Zhejiang Province have strengthened leadership in vegetable production. The Provincial Department of Agriculture and the Department of Commerce jointly held a telephone conference on February 7th to arrange late-spring vegetable production. Many special districts and counties have established vegetable production offices to promote vegetable planting experience and improve cultivation techniques through on-site meetings and training courses. Local commercial departments have also promptly transferred late-spring vegetable seeds to meet the needs of expanding vegetable planting areas.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, February 17th: The people of Guizhou's urban and rural areas are planting vegetables, melons, and beans in a timely manner. As of February 15th, the province had exceeded its vegetable spring sowing plan by one-third, with the sowing area nearly doubling compared to the same period last year.

The leading organs of Guizhou Province have attached great importance to vegetable production this year, regarding it as an important measure to improve the lives of urban and rural people and increase pig feed. Therefore, the suburbs of cities, along railways, near industrial and mining areas, and people's communes in rural areas have expanded vegetable garden areas, adopting intercropping and other methods and using all available idle land to plant a variety of vegetables such as cabbage, spinach, peppers, and tomatoes. In early February, more than 30,000 people in Tongren County participated in vegetable planting, planting many vegetables in field corners, roadsides, and beside houses, as well as in tung oil forests and tea oil forests. The Miao people of Kaili County, who rarely planted vegetables in the past, have also planted a large number of vegetables this year to support the construction of the western section of the Xiangqian Railway. By early February, the county had planted 260,000 mu of vegetables, a significant increase compared to last year. Spring vegetable sowing is also being actively carried out at tens of thousands of water conservancy construction sites, with the canteens at the water conservancy construction sites in the Tongren area alone planting more than 30,000 mu of vegetables.

Since last year, the people of towns and cities throughout the province have been using scattered open spaces to plant vegetables. This year, they plan to plant 300,000 mu of vegetables. Currently, government agencies, organizations, factories, and schools in Guiyang City have planted more than 5,000 mu of vegetables, and half of the government agencies and organizations are determined to achieve self-sufficiency in vegetables this year.

All localities are paying attention to planting high-yield crops such as pumpkins. Pumpkins have a high yield and can be used as both vegetables and pig feed. Members of the Chengguan Commune in Tongren County have planted eighty-one pumpkin mountains, and cadres have planted more than 56,000 pumpkin "kings."

In order to solve the problem of vegetable seeds, many places have held seed exchange meetings, adopting equal-value exchange methods for adjustment. Zunyi City has exchanged more than 10,000 jin of vegetable seeds among communes, management areas, and production teams, enabling more than 20,000 mu of vegetable fields to be sown in a timely manner.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, February 17th: A mass movement to rush to plant early spring vegetables and fodder has been launched in various parts of Sichuan, and many regions have already exceeded the planting targets set by the provincial leading organs.

The rush planting movement of early spring vegetables had already formed a high tide around the Spring Festival. Leshan County put forward the slogan of "500 vegetable seedlings per person," and to date, more than 27 million seedlings of various vegetables such as pak choi, spinach, mustard greens, and hot radishes have been planted. In the heat of the rush to plant "hundreds of melons and thousands of beans," the people's communes of Qianwei County planted a large number of pumpkins and 24 million seedlings of green beans in a very short time. In the rush to plant early spring vegetables, Neijiang, Xinfan, Chongqing, Deyang, Jiangjin, Daxian, Fuling, Lezhi and other places, in addition to planting early spring vegetables in the fixed vegetable fields in urban and rural areas in a timely manner after the autumn and winter vegetables were harvested, also used riverbanks, roadsides, barren slopes, field corners, front and back of houses, and adopted intercropping and other methods to greatly increase the vegetable planting area. Xinfan County has achieved the following in vegetable planting: "No inch of land is left unplanted, every gap is filled with seedlings, melons and beans hang full of shelves, roads become tree-lined, graves are adorned with flower crowns (vegetables), and greenery is everywhere." According to past experience, the Langshan Commune in Jiangjin County has intercropped a lot of pak choi, lettuce, mustard greens and other vegetables in more than 4,100 mu of small spring land.

While planting vegetables, all localities have also planted a large number of high-yield feed crops such as pumpkins to meet the needs of the continued leap forward in pig production this year. At present, in the plains, hills, or mountainous areas throughout the province, people sowing pumpkins can be seen everywhere, and many places have planted pumpkins on mountains, ditches, slopes, and hills. Ebian, Qianwei, Santai, Yibin, Jingyan, Nanjiang, Hongya, Dazu, Daxian and other places, which started earlier, have already planted pumpkins, averaging not three or five seedlings per person, but ten or eight, greatly exceeding the planting requirements put forward by the provincial leading organs. Leading organs at all levels in Ebian County took the lead at each level, and in five days, the county planted more than 2.67 million pumpkin seedlings, an average of 32 per person. The people of Qianwei County have adopted the method of filling gaps, making full use of the front and back of houses, field corners, ditch sides, roadsides, and barren mountains and slopes to plant pumpkins, averaging more than 90 seedlings per person. In order to ensure that every seedling is planted and survives, and to promote high yield, all localities have dug deep holes and applied more base fertilizer when planting pumpkins. Those who transplanted seedlings generally adopted the method of raising seedlings in warm beds to cultivate strong seedlings; those who directly sowed seeds also soaked them in warm water before sowing. Dazu, Santai and other places have also adopted the method of "whoever plants is responsible for management," assigning people to strengthen management of each seedling, striving for strong pumpkin vines and lush flowers, more melons, and large melons.

In order to mobilize the masses to rush to plant early spring vegetables and pumpkins, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee issued two notices on January 21, pointing out that planting more early spring vegetables can not only turn the vegetable off-season in March and April into a peak season, ensuring the vegetable needs of urban and rural people; at the same time, with more vegetables, vegetable roots and skins can also be used as feed to support the development of pig raising. The notice pointed out that pumpkins are a high-yield feed crop with strong adaptability to soil and temperature, and are a "magic weapon" for developing pig raising. All localities should launch a province-wide mass pumpkin planting movement in February and March, requiring rural areas to plant an average of three to five seedlings per person and harvest 100 jin to use as pig feed. In order to respond to the call of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, leading cadres at all levels in all localities have paid attention to vigorously cultivating pumpkin kings, establishing pacesetters, and guiding the overall situation. Among the more than 2.6 million pumpkin seedlings planted in Ebian County, more than 600,000 were pumpkin kings cultivated by leaders at all levels. Each member of the Hongya County Party Committee has planted five pumpkin kings. Thanks to the leadership taking the lead, a mass upsurge of pumpkin planting has been quickly set off.

    增种蔬菜是一项政治任务
    浙江贵州种植计划超额完成
    四川群众抢种瓜菜形成高潮
    新华社杭州17日电　浙江各城市郊区和农村人民公社抓紧时机，利用一切空隙闲地，突击赶种菠菜、萝卜、白菜、胶菜等晚春收获的蔬菜，目前，全省已经超额完成了种植计划，许多地区蔬菜播种面积比去年同期显著扩大，品种也普遍比去年增加。
    杭州、宁波、温州、金华、湖州和新安江等城市郊区和工矿区，都根据就地生产、就地供应的方针，千方百计扩种晚春蔬菜，力争4、5月份有大量鲜菜上市，变往年的蔬菜供应淡季为旺季。金华市郊区今年晚春蔬菜种植面积共达三千多亩，比去年同期扩大30％以上；温室蔬菜种植面积也比去年增加了近一倍。
    全省各地人民公社的公共食堂，纷纷利用田头地角、路旁河旁和采取间作套种等办法，已抢种晚春蔬菜四十多万亩。许多公社还提出“寸土不让，见缝插针”的口号，开展了人人动手，户户种菜的运动，保证食堂蔬菜品种多、数量足，生猪有足够的青饲料。宁波市郊勤钢公社开展每户社员种五十株南瓜运动后，全社迅速播下了二十多万株南瓜。
    今年浙江省各级党委和有关领导部门都加强了蔬菜生产领导。省农业厅、商业厅在2月7日联合召开了电话会议，安排晚春蔬菜生产；许多专区、县成立了蔬菜生产办公室，通过召开现场会议、举办训练班等方式，推广种菜经验，提高栽培技术。各地商业部门也及时调运晚春蔬菜种子，供应适应扩大蔬菜种植面积的需要。
    新华社贵阳17日电　贵州城乡人民适时大种蔬菜瓜豆。到2月15日止，全省已超额三分之一完成了蔬菜春播计划，播种面积比去年同期扩大近两倍。
    贵州省领导机关今年十分重视蔬菜生产，把它当作改善城乡人民生活、增加养猪饲料的重要措施。因此，城市郊区、铁路沿线、工矿附近和各地农村人民公社，都扩大菜园面积，采取间种、套作等办法和利用一切空闲土地，大种特种白菜、菠菜、辣椒和西红柿等多种多样的蔬菜。铜仁县2月初参加种菜的有三万多人，他们在田边地角、路边屋侧和油桐林、油茶林中种了很多蔬菜。过去很少种蔬菜的凯里县苗族人民，为了支援湘黔铁路西段的兴建，今年也大种蔬菜，到2月上旬全县已种菜二十六万亩，比去年扩大了很多。在几万处水利工地上，春菜播种工作也在积极展开，仅铜仁专区水利工地食堂种的蔬菜就有三万多亩。
    全省城镇人民去年以来就利用零星空地种植蔬菜，今年他们计划种菜三十万亩，目前贵阳市机关、团体和工厂、学校已种菜五千多亩，有半数机关团体决心在今年内实现蔬菜自给。
    各地都很注意种植南瓜等高产作物。南瓜产量高，既可当菜，又可当猪饲料。铜仁县城关公社社员已种南瓜山八十一座，干部种南瓜“王”五万六千多窝。
    为了解决菜种问题，许多地方召开了种子交流会，采取等价交换办法，进行调剂。遵义市在各公社、管理区和生产队间，互通有无，调剂菜种一万多斤，使二万多亩菜地及时下种。
    新华社成都17日电　四川各地掀起了突击抢种早春蔬菜和饲料的群众运动，许多地区已经超额完成了省领导机关提出的种植指标。
    各地抢种早春蔬菜的突击运动，早在春节前后就形成了高潮。乐山县提出“每人种菜五百窝”的口号，到目前为止，已种瓢儿白、菠菜、牛皮菜、热萝卜等各种蔬菜二千七百多万窝。犍为县各人民公社在抢种“百瓜千豆”的热潮中，很短时间内就抢种了大量南瓜和二千四百万窝四季豆。内江、新繁、崇庆、德阳、江津、达县、涪陵、乐至等地在抢种早春蔬菜中，除了把城、乡固定的蔬菜地，在秋冬蔬菜收获后，及时全部种上早春蔬菜以外，还利用河边路旁、荒坡隙地、田边地角、屋前屋后和采取间种、套种等办法，大量增加蔬菜种植面积。新繁县在种菜中做到：“寸土不放过，见缝就插针，瓜豆挂满架，道路成林荫，坟包戴花冠（种菜），遍地一片青。”江津县琅山公社根据以往的经验，已在四千一百多亩小春地中，套种、间种了很多瓢儿白、窝笋、牛皮菜等蔬菜。
    各地在种植蔬菜的同时，都适应今年养猪生产继续跃进的需要，大量种植南瓜等高产饲料作物。目前，全省不论平坝、丘陵地区或山区，到处都可以看见播种南瓜的人们，许多地方的山、沟、塝、坡都种满了南瓜。动手较早的峨边、犍为、三台、宜宾、井研、南江、洪雅、大足、达县等地，已经栽种的南瓜，平均每人不是三窝五窝，而是十窝八窝，大大超过了省领导机关提出的种植要求。峨边县各级领导机关层层带头，五天时间内，全县就种植南瓜二百六十七万多窝，平均每人三十二窝。犍为县人民采取见缝插针的办法，充分利用屋前屋后、田边地角、沟边路旁、荒山荒坡种植南瓜，平均每人已种九十多窝。为了保证种一窝活一窝，苗全苗壮，促使高产，各地在种植南瓜时都做到了深挖窝和多施底肥。育苗移栽的，一般都采用温床育苗的办法，培育壮苗；直播的也经过温水浸种以后才播种。大足、三台等地还采取谁种谁管的办法，定人定窝加强管理，力争南瓜藤壮花茂，多结瓜，结大瓜。
    为了动员群众突击抢种早春蔬菜和南瓜，中共四川省委和省人民委员会1月21日发出了两个通知，指出多种早春蔬菜，不仅能变3、4月份蔬菜淡季为旺季，确保城乡人民的蔬菜需要；同时，蔬菜多了，还可利用菜根、菜皮充作饲料，支持养猪事业的发展。通知指出，南瓜是对土壤、温度适应性强的高产饲料作物，是发展养猪事业的一个“法宝”，各地应在2、3月份，开展一个全民性的大种南瓜运动，要求农村平均每人要种三窝到五窝，收获一百斤，充作猪饲料。为了响应省委和省人民委员会号召，各地各级领导干部都注意大力培植南瓜王，树立标兵，指导全面。峨边县已种的二百六十多万窝南瓜中，有六十多万窝是各级领导培植的南瓜王。洪雅县县委委员每人都种有五窝南瓜王。由于领导带头，迅速掀起了群众性种南瓜的高潮。
