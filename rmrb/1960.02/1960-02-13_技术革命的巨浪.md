The Great Wave of the Technological Revolution
By our reporter He Changhua

A Strong Desire

Stepping into the shearing and punching workshop of the Shanghai Motor Factory, people are attracted by many vivid scenes. This is clearly a production workshop, yet it feels like entering a rich and colorful technological innovation exhibition.

Here, every machine tool and every process has undergone major and minor innovations. Various simple, indigenous, and combined mechanical and semi-automatic equipment feed and align materials according to people's wishes. Many innovations have increased work efficiency by multiples, even dozens of times. In just a few months, the entire workshop has implemented more than a thousand innovation projects, with over 95% of manual operations replaced by machinery, and some equipment has been semi-automated. Although the workshop's production tasks are constantly increasing, they are being overfulfilled every month.

The most touching thing is not these achievements, but the high degree of consciousness shown by people in creating these innovations. They regard technological innovation as a great pleasure in their lives, becoming so fascinated that they think about it while eating, walking, and sleeping. Every small thing in life is associated with it.

One Sunday afternoon, worker Chen Shujin passed by the factory's primary school and saw the innocent children playing happily in the campus, some sliding down slides, some swinging on swings... full of joy. Chen Shujin, who was thinking about how to improve manual material alignment, was suddenly inspired by the swinging swings. He immediately rushed to the factory and, based on the inertia principle of the swing, created a live grid material aligning rack, replacing the heavy labor of squatting on the ground to align materials all day long. One night, worker Ji Wenhu was sitting in the auditorium watching a movie, and the newsreel showed an electric shovel digging coal, the claws of the shovel opening and closing. His heart skipped a beat, and he suddenly saw the light. He couldn't even bother to finish watching the movie and ran back to the workshop to work on his unloading box. The unloading box also had a door opened at the bottom like the shovel, and all the loaded parts were unloaded at once, making it ten times more efficient than manual labor and saving labor. The game of playing golf on the side of the road, the "rubber arrow" in the toy gun that children play with, the pump used to unclog toilets, the circular pattern on a matchbox... these small things in daily life that people don't pay attention to were caught by the highly conscious workers, and they applied their principles to their innovations. At first, in their minds, there was no image of their creation at all, and they didn't even know what kind of thing they would create. But the strong revolutionary desire drove them to explore various methods, capturing various things in daily life, and finally turning imagination into reality and achieving success.

The First Step: Liberating Thought

The working masses have a strong desire to engage in mechanization and semi-automation on a large scale, improve labor productivity, and liberate themselves from heavy labor. This workshop is the first workshop for processing parts, and due to the rapid growth of production in various product workshops, they are under great pressure. Although many operations in the workshop involve machine tools, manual operations such as feeding, aligning, and sheet metal still account for a large proportion. Manual operation is not only inefficient, but also unsafe and tiring. However, in the past, some people had a mystical view and a sense of inferiority towards mechanization and semi-automation, which affected their ability to realize their wishes. A debate once occurred among the workers, with some believing that engaging in mechanization and semi-automation on a large scale was a good way to improve labor productivity and get rid of heavy labor, and that it must be done and could be done. But others thought: It's good, but it can't be done. "Automation, just press the button, look at the instruments, the raw materials go in here, and the finished products come out there, we are far from it!" "Shearing and punching workers who step on foot pedals can't design or draw, and they can't turn, file, plane, or mill. If they want to engage in any mechanization or semi-automation, isn't that like a blind man running - crashing around!" The workshop Party branch analyzed the workers' ideological situation and believed that it was necessary to liberate the workers' thinking and break down the mystical views and feelings of inferiority in order to carry out technological innovation vigorously; and called on Party and Youth League members to dare to act and dare to do things, and to set an example.

This debate shook the old shearing and punching worker and Communist Party member Guan Jinsheng. This old worker, who didn't like to talk much, was completely loyal to the cause of the Party. He and his apprentice jointly managed a shearing machine, one shearing material and the other squatting on the ground to align material. The materials came and were sheared and punched by them before going to the back for processing, which was the first step of the entire section. In the days of the Great Leap Forward, everyone's production doubled, and he thought: "I, a Communist Party member, cannot hold others back!" He ignored the leaders' advice and secretly worked overtime. But he really felt that this way of working was tiring and slow, and it wouldn't work in the long run. It would be great if something could replace manual material alignment. He told the technician about this idea, and the technician said: "This is not an easy thing!" His idea of innovation was shelved. At this time, the debate in the workshop and the call of the Party branch rekindled his strong desire to get rid of heavy labor. "Is it really impossible? How do you know it won't work if you haven't even tried it? I am a Party member and should take the lead." He told the Party branch about his ideas, and the branch strongly supported him. He searched around, found four foreign coins, a piece of scrap steel plate, and four feet of old rollers. After several failures, he finally made a material aligning rack. The aligning rack arranged the sheared materials neatly and saved one worker's labor.

The workshop Party branch seized this advanced seedling and shouted it out loud, held a site meeting, and Guan Jinsheng gave a demonstration in public. The Party branch also pointed out to all Party members that this creation was not yet complete, but it was a direction, and all Party members should learn from Guan Jinsheng. They also put forward a resounding slogan to all the workers in the workshop: Mechanization through hammering and banging, automation through shearing, punching and painting, doubling production efficiency, one person doing the work of two.

Guan Jinsheng's innovation has a very simple structure and does not look amazing, but it is like a sharp weapon, breaking down people's ideological mystery. It is like a spark that ignites people's pioneering spirit. The whole workshop discussed it, and the old worker Yang Jinmu said: "Who said that our shearing and punching workers can't engage in mechanization? Isn't this it!" Some workers said: "Since his shearing machine can automatically align materials, why can't others!" A massive innovation upsurge was quickly set off in the workshop, and many workers began to set up material aligning devices behind their machine tools.

The revolutionary wave in the workshop is moving forward one wave higher than another. Everyone is involved in this revolution, and even the young apprentices and auxiliary workers who guide the traveling cranes have made innovations. The young worker Tang Taoming, who only entered the workshop last year, is a level one worker. With the help of his master, he continuously made four innovations on a punch press. There is a punch press in the workshop for punching cooling fins, which is inefficient and very dangerous. The worker pushes the iron sheet under the punch head with his hand, steps on it with his foot, and pop, one piece; pushes, steps, and pop, one piece... The output per shift has always remained at around 13,000 pieces. Tang Taoming first modified the foot switch, and one step on the foot would continuously punch down pop-pop-pop, and the shift output increased to 20,000 pieces. Although 20,000 pieces is 7,000 more than 13,000, it still cannot meet the needs of other workshops. Moreover, new contradictions have also arisen in the operation: the hand feeding cannot keep up with the machine. How annoying! This level one worker also asked people around and flipped through books, determined to revolutionize the fate of manual feeding. Finally, he came up with the idea of installing a hook on the upper part of the punch head, using the up and down movement of the punch head to drive the hook to feed the material, and the shift output jumped to more than 30,000 pieces. ... The master of the same machine tool felt that the speed could be increased, so he added icing on the cake and added a roller to the punch press, which increased the shift output to about 40,000 pieces. Originally, two punch presses were still in short supply of cooling fins, but now one punch press is more than enough.

Take the Fastest Route

Getting rid of backward manual operations and marching towards mechanization and semi-automation is also a struggle for time and speed. Should we emphasize standardization, reach upwards, and wait for the conditions to mature slowly? Or should we rely on our own efforts, be resourceful, first start with indigenous methods, and then gradually improve? The working masses of this workshop, armed with the thought of the General Line and mobilized with consciousness, have answered this question well. Sheet metal workers, who deal with hammers all day long, used to knock until their backs ached, and the processed windshields could not even meet one-third of the needs. How to change this situation? The technicians designed a 120-ton press. When this plan was brought to the workers for discussion, the workers raised four questions: The working area is already very crowded. What if there is not enough space after this tall and large press is installed? Where will the materials come from to build such equipment? More importantly, when will it be built? How can distant water save a burning house? ... In short, it does not conform to the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical results. The masses overturned this plan and wanted to rely on their own efforts to build indigenous equipment. The workshop leaders encouraged the masses to be bold. At the three-in-one meeting of leaders, cadres, workers, and technicians, everyone spoke their minds, and collective wisdom outlined the contour of their new creation - the edging machine. They said they would do it and did it. Some looked for waste materials, and some built the frame. In a few days, they successfully built an indigenous edging machine, replacing the hammers that they could not leave, giving the technicians a great education.

In the heat wave of technological innovation, the workers' minds became more and more flexible, the fighting became more and more tenacious, and the style became more and more elevated. Some major creations also emerged from the widespread innovation of the masses. The indigenous and foreign combined semi-automatic painting machine they created is one of them. For this creation, they concentrated the collective wisdom and fought for several months. In order to solve an important technical problem, they sought advice from teachers and friends everywhere. They went to all the places where they estimated they could get inspiration. Various rubber utensils, even the pumps used to unclog toilets and the toys children play with, were used for testing. In order to realize this creation, the workers discussed several different design schemes; they also specially established a three-in-one fighting team. Finally, they were victorious. In the past, one worker in front was busy sending circular steel sheets into the painting machine for painting and drying; two workers in the back were busy sorting them out. The newly baked silicon steel sheets were scalding hot, and the workers felt hot even with three pairs of gloves on their hands, and electric fans were also turned on here in winter. Now, all these operations have been replaced by machinery. The machine regularly sends the silicon steel sheets into the painting machine, and the painted silicon steel sheets are automatically stacked neatly one by one. It is very quiet here, and only one worker sits there looking at the machine, calling the traveling crane to lift the raw materials and lift the finished products at certain times.

The shearing and punching workshop has fully exerted the collective wisdom of the masses, forming a new situation of continuous revolution and continuous Great Leap Forward, setting an example for other workshops. At present, a new upsurge of marching towards mechanization and semi-automation has been set off throughout the factory.

    技术革命的巨浪

    强烈的愿望
    走进上海电机厂的剪冲车间，人们就被很多生动的情景吸引住了。这里明明是一个生产车间，却像是来到了一个丰富多彩的技术革新展览会。
    在这里，每一台机床、每一道工序都有大大小小的革新。各种各样简易的土洋结合的机械化半自动化设备，按照人们的意愿进行送料整料。许多革新把工作效率成倍、十几倍地提高。在短短的几个月中，全车间实现了一千多个革新项目，95％以上的手工操作都已经由机械代替，部分机器设备已做到了半自动化。车间的生产任务虽然不断增长，但都月月超额完成。
    最感动人的还不是这些，而是在创造这些革新中所表现出的人的高度的自觉。他们把搞技术革新当作自己生活中的一大愉快，像着了迷一样，吃饭、走路、睡觉……都在想，生活中的一切细小事物都被他们联想上去了。
    一个星期天的下午，工人陈书金路过工厂子弟小学，看见天真的孩子们正在校园里游戏，有的滑滑梯，有的荡秋千……，兴高采烈。正想着如何改进手工整料的陈书金，忽然从那荡来荡去的秋千上得到了启发，立刻奔到工厂，根据秋千的惯性原理，搞成了活格整料架，代替了成天蹲在地上整料的繁重劳动。一天夜里，工人季文虎坐在大礼堂里看电影，新闻片里映出了电铲掘煤，掘斗的爪子一张一合。他心里一楞，豁然开了心窍，电影也顾不得看下去了，跑回车间搞起自己的卸料箱来。卸料箱也像掘斗一样下面开了门，一开门装的零件统统卸了出来，比原来人工效率高十倍，节省了劳动力。马路边上打高尔夫球游戏，孩子们玩的玩具手枪里的“橡皮箭”，通抽水马桶用的泵浦，火柴盒上的圆形图案……这些日常生活中不为人们注意的小事物，却被具有高度自觉的工人们抓住了，把它们的原理用到了自己的革新上去。开始，在他们的脑海里，对自己的创造一点形象也没有，要搞成个什么样儿的东西连自己也不知道。但强烈的革命愿望冲动着他们去探索着各种各样的方法，捕捉日常生活中的各种事物，终于把想像变成了现实，创造成功了。
    第一关解放思想
    工人群众对大搞机械化半自动化，提高劳动生产率，把自己从繁重劳动中解放出来，有着强烈的要求。这个车间是加工零件的先行车间，由于各个产品车间生产迅速增长，给他们压力很大。虽然车间里很多是机床操作，但送料、整料、钣金等手工操作仍占很大比重。手工操作一则是生产效率低，再则既不安全又很劳累。但是，过去有些人对机械化半自动化存在着神秘观念和自卑心理，影响了他们去实现自己的愿望。职工群众中曾经发生过一场争论，一部分人认为，大搞机械化半自动化是提高劳动生产率，摆脱笨重劳动的好出路，一定得走，也走得通。但也有人认为：好是好，就是办不到。“自动化嘛，按按电钮，看看仪表，原料这边进去，成品那边出来，我们还差得远哩！”“踏脚板的剪冲工，一不会设计绘图，二不会车、钳、刨、铣，要想搞什么机械化半自动化，那不是瞎子跑路——乱撞！”车间党支部分析了工人的思想状况，认为必须解放工人的思想，破除神秘观念和自卑心理，才能使技术革新轰轰烈烈地开展起来；并且号召党、团员首先要敢作、敢为，以身作则。
    这一场争论，震动了老剪冲工、共产党员管金生。这位不爱多讲话的老工人，对党的事业一片忠诚。他和艺徒共同管理一台剪刀车，一个剪料，一个蹲在地上整料。材料来了，先经过他们剪冲以后再到后面去加工，是整个工段的第一关。在大跃进的日子里，大家的生产都翻番，他心想：“我这个共产党员不能拖人家的后腿呵！”他不顾领导的劝告，暗暗加班。但他的确感到，这样干又累又慢，长久下去不是法子，能用个什么东西代替人工整料就好了。他把这个念头告诉了技术员，技术员说：“这不是容易的事情啊！”他的革新的念头搁了下来。这时，车间里的争论，党支部的号召，又把他要摆脱笨重劳动的强烈愿望燃烧起来。“难道真的办不到吗？还没有干，怎么就知道不行呢？我是党员，应当带头闯。”他把自己的想法告诉了党支部，支部大力支持他。他东翻西寻，找来了四个洋元，一块废钢板，四尺旧滚轮，经过接连几次失败，终于把一台整料架制成了。整料架把剪好的料整理得整整齐齐，节省了一个劳动力。
    车间党支部抓住这一先进事物的萌芽，大喊大叫，召开了现场会议，由管金生当众作表演。党支部并且向全体党员指出，这项创造虽然还不完整，但是一个方向，党员都应该向管金生看齐。还向全车间职工群众提出了响亮的口号：敲敲打打机械化，剪冲涂漆自动化，生产效率翻一番，两人工作一人担。
    管金生的革新，结构非常简单，其貌很不惊人，但它却像一把锋利的武器，破除了人们思想上的神秘观念。有如星星之火，点燃了人们的首创精神。全车间议论开了，老工人杨金木说：“谁说我们剪冲工不能搞机械化，这不就是吗！”有的工人说：“既然他的剪刀车可以自动整料，为什么其他的就不可以！”车间里很快掀起了一个声势浩大的革新热潮，很多工人都在自己机床的后面搞起了整料的装置。
    革命的浪潮在车间里一浪高一浪地向前推进，人人投入了这场革命，连那些年青的艺徒，引导行车的辅助工也搞出了革新。前年才进车间的青年工人唐弢铭，是个一级工，他也在老师傅的帮助下在一台冲床上连续作了四次革新。车间里有台冲冷却片的冲床，效率低，又很危险，工人用手把铁片向冲头底下一推，脚一踏，扑通，一片；一推，一踏，扑通，一片……每班的产量一直停留在一万三千片左右。唐弢铭首先改装了脚踏开关，脚踏一次，能扑通扑通地连续冲下去，班产量提高到了两万片。两万片虽然比一万三多了七千，但还是不能满足别的车间的需要。而且在操作上也产生了新的矛盾：送料的手跟不上机器。这多恼人呀！这位一级工又东问人，西翻书，一心想革掉手工送料的命。终于，他想出在冲头上部装置一个钩子，利用冲头上下带动钩子来送料，班产量就跳到三万多片。……同机床的老师傅觉得车速还可以加快，又来了个锦上添花，在冲床上加了个滚轮，使班产量又猛增到四万片左右。本来两台冲床加工还供不应求的冷却片，现在一台冲床加工还绰绰有余。
    走最快的路
    摆脱落后的手工操作，向机械化半自动化进军，也是一个争时间比速度的斗争。是强调正规，向上伸手，等待条件成熟慢慢来呢？还是自力更生，因陋就简，先用土法上马，然后步步提高？这个车间的工人群众被总路线思想武装起来，自觉性调动起来以后，很好的回答了这个问题。成天与鎯头锤子打交道的钣金工人，过去敲得腰酸背痛，加工的挡风板也不能满足需要的三分之一。怎样来改变这种局面？技术人员就设计了一台压力一百二十吨的压床。当这个方案拿到工人中去讨论，工人们提出了四个疑问：作业场地本来就很拥挤，这台又高又大的压床安装以后，场地不够怎么办？造这样的设备，材料哪里来？更重要的是什么时候才能造好，远水怎能救得了近火？……总之，不符合多快好省的精神。群众把这个方案推翻了，要自力更生，自搞土设备。车间领导鼓励群众大胆的干。在领导干部、工人和技术人员的三结合会议上，你一句，我一言，集体智慧勾出了他们的新创造——滚边机的轮廓，并且说干就干，有的寻找废料，有的把架子搭起来，几天功夫就搞成功了一台土滚边机，代替了不离手的鎯头，给技术人员很大的教育。
    在技术革新的热浪中，职工群众的脑筋越用越灵活，战斗越来越顽强，风格越来越高。一些重大的创造也在群众广泛的革新中涌现出来。他们创造的土洋结合的半自动化涂漆机，就是其中的一个。为了这项创造，他们集中了集体的智慧，前后战斗了好几个月。为了解决一个重要的技术问题，他们到处寻师访友，凡是估计可以得到启发的地方，他们都跑到了；各种各样的橡皮用具，连通抽水马桶用的泵浦、孩子们玩的玩具，都用来作过试验。为了实现这项创造，工人们对几种不同的设计方案，展开讨论；还专门成立了三结合战斗队。最后，他们终于胜利了。过去，前面的一个工人忙个不停地把圆形的钢片送进涂漆机涂漆、烘干；后面两个工人忙着整理。刚烘过的矽钢片滚烫，工人手上戴三副手套也感烫手，冬天这里也开着大风扇。现在，所有这些操作都已经被机械代替了，机械有规律地把矽钢片送进了涂漆机，漆好的矽钢片又自动一张张地叠得整整齐齐。这里显得很安静，只有一个工人坐在那里看看机器，一定的时候叫行车吊来原料、吊走成品。
    剪冲车间充分发挥群众的集体智慧，形成了不断革命，不断大跃进的新局面，为其他车间树立了榜样。目前全厂又掀起了一个向机械化半自动化进军的新高潮。
