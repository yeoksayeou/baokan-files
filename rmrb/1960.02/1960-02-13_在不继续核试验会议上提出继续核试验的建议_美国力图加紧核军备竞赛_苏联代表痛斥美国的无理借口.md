Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, February 11th: The US representative today presented a so-called phased solution to the problem of discontinuing nuclear weapons testing at the Geneva Three-Nation Conference on Discontinuing Nuclear Weapons Tests. Using technical difficulties in monitoring underground explosions as a pretext, the US representative suggested that the effective scope of the treaty prohibiting nuclear tests should not be extended to underground nuclear explosions that could cause seismic phenomena below a certain level. This proposal is essentially to provide freedom of action to resume nuclear weapons testing. The US proposal was supported by the British representative.

It is known that from the very beginning of the Geneva Conference on Discontinuing Nuclear Weapons Tests, the US military and monopoly capital groups, the Pentagon, the Atomic Energy Commission, and many reactionaries, keen on the arms race, have frantically opposed the United States signing a treaty prohibiting nuclear tests. The recent US proposal proves that those who oppose stopping nuclear weapons testing still prevail in the United States. The US Atomic Energy Commission and the Department of the Army have long been prepared to carry out atomic and hydrogen bomb explosions, and now they are only waiting for a signal to resume nuclear tests. They have made all the necessary preparations for this – they have already transported all kinds of new nuclear weapons to the test site. Despite the fact that the Geneva Conference on Discontinuing Nuclear Weapons Tests has achieved some positive results in negotiating the treaty text, the United States has put forward such a proposal, which proves that the United States is preparing to take all means to prevent the signing of a treaty prohibiting all types of nuclear weapons tests and to obstruct the cessation of the nuclear arms race.

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, February 11th: The Soviet representative to the Discontinuing Nuclear Tests Conference, Tsarapkin, told Xinhua reporters here tonight, "The main intention of the proposal put forward by the United States at the meeting today is to allow the continuation of nuclear weapons testing in principle, thereby promoting the arms race."

He said, "This proposal is unacceptable to us. Compared with the situation since the start of the meeting on October 31, 1958, when nuclear weapons testing was not being carried out, this is a step backward."

The US representative argued that the US proposal should not be seen as asking other countries to conduct nuclear explosions, because they cannot conduct nuclear explosions with the small explosive power stipulated by the US proposal.

Tsarapkin pointed out that this statement is not true, and if the Americans resume nuclear tests, other countries may conduct nuclear explosions.

Tsarapkin said, "Although the situation at our meeting has deteriorated, the Soviet Union will make its utmost efforts to change the attitude of the West and reach a treaty with the West prohibiting all nuclear weapons tests."

The Soviet representative refuted reports in the British press that the British attitude differed from that of the United States. He said, "Britain fully supports the US position at the conference."

### 在不继续核试验会议上提出继续核试验的建议  美国力图加紧核军备竞赛  苏联代表痛斥美国的无理借口

    在不继续核试验会议上提出继续核试验的建议
    美国力图加紧核军备竞赛
    苏联代表痛斥美国的无理借口
    新华社12日电　塔斯社日内瓦11日讯：美国代表今天在日内瓦三国不继续核武器试验会议上提出了所谓分阶段解决不继续核试验问题的建议。美国代表以监督地下爆炸方面的技术性困难作借口，建议关于禁止核试验的条约的有效范围不扩大到可以引起一定程度以下的地震现象的地下核爆炸。这一建议实质上是要为恢复核武器试验提供行动自由。美国的这一建议得到了英国代表的支持。
    大家知道，从日内瓦不继续核武器试验会议一开始，热衷于军备竞赛的美国军事和垄断资本集团、五角大楼、原子能委员会和许多反动人士就疯狂地反对美国签订禁止核试验条约。美国最近这一建议证明，反对停止试验核武器的人在美国仍占上风。美国原子能委员会和陆军部早已准备进行原子弹和氢弹的爆炸，现在它们所等待的只不过是恢复核试验的一声信号。它们为这一点已经作好了一切必要的准备工作——已经把各种各样的新式核武器运到了试验场。尽管日内瓦不继续核试验会议在协商条约条文方面已经取得了一定的积极成果，但是美国还是提出了这样的建议，这就证明美国是在准备采取一切手段使禁止一切种类的核武器试验的条约不能签订，并且阻挠停止核军备竞赛。
    据新华社日内瓦11日电　苏联出席不继续核试验会议的代表查拉普金今天晚上在这里接见新华社记者时说：“今天美国在会上提出的建议的主要用意是原则上准许继续核武器试验，从而推动军备竞赛。”
    他说：“这个建议是我们不能接受的。同1958年10月31日会议开始以来核武器试验已不进行的情况相比，这是倒退了一步。”
    美国代表争辩说，美国的建议并不能看作是请其他国家进行核爆炸，因为它们不能进行像美国建议所规定的爆炸力那么小的核爆炸。
    查拉普金指出，这种说法是不确实的，如果美国人恢复核试验，其它国家就可能进行核爆炸。
    查拉普金说，“虽然我们会议的情况有了恶化，苏联将作出最大的努力来改变西方的态度，并且同西方达成一项禁止一切核武器试验的条约。”
    这位苏联代表驳斥了英国报纸所谓英国的态度不同于美国的态度的消息。他说，“英国在会议上完全支持美国的立场。”
