    Spring Plowing Ballad
    Rushing Home Under the Stars for Spring Plowing
    Guangzhou　Fan Yang
    Whips crack all the way, the horse never stops,
    The captain rushes home for spring plowing;
    Mountain winds whistle past the ears,
    Leaving the commune, climbing over the ridge.
    Busy discussions at the Party committee meeting:
    Advance rice transplanting to break the seasonal norms.
    Only finalized the grand plan in the evening,
    He starts the journey at midnight.
    The horse clip-clops on the mountain top,
    Trampling down the cold moon, extinguishing the stars;
    Morning glow rises, remnant snow melts,
    The stream's ice crunches lightly under the horse's hooves.
    The village is quiet, doors locked tight,
    Children suddenly hear the sound of horse bells,
    Cheering, they rush out of the kindergarten,
    Stopping the horse, vying to point to the clouds.
    Where the mountaintop meets the sky,
    It's densely packed with rice-transplanting people.
    Alas, riding a fast horse home under the stars,
    Still couldn't catch up with the commune members!
    Green Willow
    Sichuan Yongchuan　Fang Cao
    Green willows, the river swells,
    Red peaches and white plums bloom profusely.
    The commune families start spring plowing early,
    Planting melons in abundance before and behind their homes.
    Green willows, fine rain clears,
    The spring light is bright, the green water is smooth.
    The commune families start spring plowing early,
    Turning the soil and accumulating fertilizer, incredibly busy.
    Green willows, swallows arrive for the first time,
    Golden rapeseed flowers bloom all over the fields;
    The sons and daughters of the commune work diligently,
    Overjoyed with the abundant harvest of the early crops.
    Green willows, the scenery is new,
    Ponds full of water, villages full of flowers;
    A picturesque paradise rises from the ground,
    The people's commune lasts for ten thousand years.
    The Commune Makes Merry for Spring Plowing
    Xi'an　Tian Qi
    Secretary
    Arranging production under the moonlight,
    Going up the mountain at dawn to inspect deep plowing;
    Gripping the plow handle, raising the whip,
    The ox frolics in front of the secretary.
    The plow turns the wet soil upwards,
    Droplets of sweat hang from the tips of his mustache;
    A young man follows alongside, advising:
    "Secretary, you're old, take a rest."
    The secretary laughs upon hearing this:
    "Young man, your words lack propriety;
    Party members are neither old nor young,
    Living to be a hundred is still being young."
    Teams Compete to Start Early
    People compete to start early, donkeys compete to start early,
    Oxen compete to start early, carts compete to start early,
    Planning is earlier than action,
    The rooster crows early every morning.
    Fertilizer is sent early, the land is plowed early,
    Seeds are sown early, sprouting early,
    Every task is eagerly tackled,
    Competing to start early and competing to do well.
    Abundant fertilizer, well-plowed land,
    The crops are fertile, no weeds on the ridges;
    The commune is good in every way,
    Achieve the Program targets early!

    春耕谣
    星夜回乡赶春耕
    广州　梵杨
    一路鞭声马不停，
    队长回乡赶春耕；
    山风呼呼过耳畔，
    走出公社翻上岭。
    党委会上忙讨论：
    提早插秧破节令。
    傍晚才把大计定，
    午夜他就登路程。
    快马得得山头上，
    踏落寒月踏灭了星；
    朝霞起，残雪化，
    小溪冰脆马蹄轻。
    村寨静静门深锁，
    孩童忽闻马铃声，
    喧呼涌出幼儿园，
    拦马争说指云层。
    山顶云间接天处，
    密密尽是插秧人。
    哎，星夜回乡骑快马，
    也没追上社员们！
    杨柳青青
    四川永川　芳草
    杨柳青青江水发，
    红桃白李开繁花。
    公社人家春耕早，
    宅前屋后大种瓜。
    杨柳青青细雨晴，
    春光灿烂绿水平。
    公社人家春耕早，
    翻地积肥忙煞人。
    杨柳青青燕初来，
    黄金油菜满田开；
    公社儿女勤发奋，
    小春丰收喜满怀。
    杨柳青青景色新，
    水满池塘花满村；
    如画天堂平地起，
    人民公社万年春。
    公社闹春耕
    西安　田奇
    书记
    月下布置闹生产，
    天明上山看深翻；
    抓住犁拐扬起鞭，
    书记面前牛撒欢。
    犁犁湿土往上翻，
    点点汗珠吊须尖；
    小伙跟在一边劝：
    “书记你年老站一站。”
    书记一听呵呵笑：
    “小伙说话欠检点；
    党员没有年老少，
    活到百岁也是青年。”
    队队比早
    人比早，驴比早，
    牛比早，车比早，
    计划比早行动早，
    天天清晨鸡早叫。
    粪送早，地犁早，
    种籽早种发芽早，
    样样工作争着搞，
    又比早来又比好。
    粪上饱，地犁好，
    庄稼肥，垅无草；
    公社千般万般好，
    纲要指标早夺到！
