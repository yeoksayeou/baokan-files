A Major Technological Innovation in Tea Production
Chun'an to Achieve Semi-Mechanized Initial Tea Processing
(Our dispatch) Chun'an County, Zhejiang Province, located in a mountainous area and rich in tea production, is making full use of hydropower as power, vigorously carrying out technological innovation in tea making. This spring, it will fully realize semi-mechanization of the entire initial tea processing process.

Chun'an County began to vigorously carry out technological innovation in tea making and vigorously promote the mechanization and semi-mechanization of tea making in 1959. That year was a year of a major leap forward in the history of tea production in Chun'an County, with tea production reaching 78,916 dan, an increase of 43.5% compared to 1958 and an increase of 374% compared to the highest annual output before liberation. Vigorously carrying out technological innovation not only fundamentally solved the contradiction between grain and tea production labor, but also improved the quality of tea and reduced production costs. Manual tea making requires 18 workdays per dan, while mechanized tea making requires only 2.44 workdays, saving 15.56 workdays per dan and increasing work efficiency by 7.33 times. This alone saved 940,000 workdays for the entire county. Mechanized tea making can kill the green at high temperatures, and the operation is uniformly light and heavy, generally improving the quality by one or two grades, which can increase by 6 to 12 yuan per dan, increasing the income of tea farmers by a total of 360,000 to 720,000 yuan. Manual tea making requires 5 dan of firewood and 1.5 jin of kerosene per dan, while mechanized tea making requires only 3 dan of firewood and 0.5 jin of kerosene per dan. The entire county saves a total of 160,000 yuan in expenses. In addition, it has greatly improved the labor conditions of tea production and reduced labor intensity. The contrast between the past and present of tea-making labor for commune members in the Chun'an tea area: in the past, feet were swollen, eyes were bloodshot, heads were dizzy, and hands were blistered like lanterns; now, the gate is opened, the machine is started, the strength has not yet been used, and the tea is successfully made.

In the technological innovation, Lishang Commune made full use of the abundant hydropower resources of the mountain river drop, implemented the policy of using indigenous methods first and foreign methods later, and vigorously established tea initial processing factories, using hydropower to drive tea-making machines to realize the mechanization of the entire process of tea greening, kneading, loosening, and drying, and the tea-making efficiency was increased by more than seven times. The county party committee seized this pacesetter and organized representatives from various communes in the county to hold three on-site meetings in Lishang Commune. Due to the strong promotion, before the autumn of last year, the county rapidly built and expanded 39 fully mechanized tea initial processing factories and 1,371 semi-mechanized tea processing plants on the basis of the old-style water mill. Last year, 60,000 dan of tea in the county was initially processed by machinery and semi-machinery, accounting for 79.8% of the total tea production.

In the vigorous technological innovation, the principles of "production as the mainstay, small-scale as the mainstay, and commune-run as the mainstay" and the policy of "using indigenous methods first and foreign methods later" were implemented. Therefore, a mass movement of vigorously establishing tea initial processing factories in communes and teams was quickly launched. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient technical workers, various places organized cadres and technicians to go to Lishang Commune for on-site operation to learn factory construction technology, and county leaders sent more than 30 technical cadres and technicians to contract and patrol to teach and guide. More than 1,800 migrant workers in the county set off a wave of learning technology, and more than 800 of them have become technicians with a certain level. After breaking through the technical barrier, the problem of lacking raw materials was encountered. At this time, various places mobilized the masses to rely on their own efforts and obtain materials locally. According to statistics from twelve communes, the masses themselves established 51 brick and tile factories and 150 lime factories for their own use. The Weiping Farm Implement Repair Factory successfully trial-produced an electric automatic planing lathe to support the capital construction of the tea initial processing factory, which increased efficiency by 30 times, and successfully completed the task of making more than 5,000 jin of iron screws, meeting the factory construction needs of 16 factories in 5 communes.

In order to fully realize the mechanization of tea making, Chun'an County further launched a mass movement of vigorously carrying out technological innovation after the autumn tea harvest last year. In November last year, the county party committee put forward the slogan of "fighting for three months and building 150 factories" to the people of the county. Immediately, more than 100 factories started construction, and 114 have been completed and 41 are under construction. Calculated on the basis of 12 horsepower per hydropower tea initial processing factory, these factories are equivalent to 1,250 power machines that do not use fuel, and the power part alone can replace 15,000 laborers, saving 4.5 million labor days a year.

The spring tea picking season is coming soon. Therefore, from the county party committee to the leaders at all levels, they have gone deep into the construction sites to strengthen the leadership of the vigorous establishment of tea initial processing factories. Twelve commune party committee secretaries and 167 production team branch secretaries in the county all eat, live and work with the masses at the construction site.

    茶叶生产的一项重大技术革新
    淳安将实现初制茶叶半机械化
    本报讯　地处山区、盛产茶叶的浙江淳安县，充分利用水力作动力，大搞制茶技术革新，今年春季将全面实现初制茶叶全程半机械化。
    淳安县从1959年开始大搞制茶技术革新，大搞制茶机械化、半机械化。这一年，是淳安县茶叶生产史上特大跃进的一年，茶叶产量达到了七万八千九百一十六担，比1958年增长43．5％，比解放前最高年产量增长374％。大搞技术革新，不仅基本上解决了粮、茶生产劳力上的矛盾，而且提高了茶叶的质量，降低了生产成本。手工制茶每担需十八个工，机械制茶只要二点四四个工，每担节省劳力十五点五六个工，提高工效七点三三倍。全县仅此一项就节约出劳力九十四万个。机械制茶能高温杀青，操作上轻重均匀，一般都提高品质一、二个等级，每担可提高六到十二元，共为茶农增加收入三十六万到七十二万元。手工制茶每担要柴五担，煤油一斤半，机械制茶每担只要三担柴，半斤煤油。全县共节约费用十六万元。此外还大大改善了制茶生产的劳动条件，减轻了劳动强度。淳安茶区社员在制茶劳动上的今昔对比：过去是脚站肿，眼熬红，头里昏冬冬，手泡像灯笼；现在是闸门开，机器动，力气还未用，茶叶制成功。
    在技术革新中，里商公社充分利用山区河流落差的丰富水力动力资源，贯彻土法上马、先土后洋的方针，大办茶叶初制厂，用水力带动制茶机，实现茶叶杀青、揉捻、解块、烘干等整个工序机械化，制茶效率提高七倍多。县委抓住这个标兵，组织全县各公社的代表在里商公社前后召开了三次现场会议。由于强有力的推动，在去年秋季以前，全县就在旧式水碓的基础上，迅速新建和扩建起全程机械化的茶叶初制厂三十九个，半机械制茶场一千三百七十一个，去年全县有六万担茶叶用机械和半机械初制，占茶叶总产量的79．8％。
    在大搞技术革新中，贯彻执行了“生产为主，小型为主，社办为主”的原则和“土法上马，先土后洋”的方针，因此很快地掀起了一个社社队队大办茶叶初制厂的群众运动。为了解决技术工人不足的困难，各地组织了干部、技工到里商公社去现场操作，学习建厂技术，县领导上又派出三十多个技术干部和技工，分片包干，巡回传授辅导。全县一千八百多个民工掀起了学技术的热潮，其中有八百多人已成为具备一定水平的技工。突破技术关以后，又遇到了缺乏原材料的问题，这时各地就发动群众自力更生，就地取材。据十二个公社统计，群众自己办起砖瓦厂五十一个，石灰厂一百五十个，自烧自用。威坪农具修配厂为支援茶叶初制厂的基建工作，试制成功了一台电动自动化刨丝车床，效率提高三十倍，胜利完成了制铁质螺丝五千多斤的任务，满足了五个公社十六个厂的建厂需要。
    为了全面实现制茶机械化，淳安县在去年秋茶收摘以后又进一步掀起了大搞技术革新的群众运动。县委在去年11月向全县人民提出了
  “大战三个月，建厂一百五十个”的口号，当即有一百多个厂开工建设，现已建成一百十四个，正在动工兴建的有四十一个。每个水力动力茶叶初制厂以十二马力计算，这些厂就相等于一千二百五十台不用燃料的动力机，光动力部分就可代替一万五千个劳动力，一年可以节约四百五十万个劳动日。
    今年春茶采摘季节很快就要到了，因此，从县委到各级领导都深入工地，加强了大办茶叶初制厂的领导。全县有十二个公社党委书记、一百六十七个生产队支部书记都和工地群众同吃同住同劳动。
