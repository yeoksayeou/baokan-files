    Silkworm Raising Expert Lin Shuying
    By our reporter Yin Ping

    She is a person who is never complacent, improving silkworm rearing techniques time and time again, causing silkworm cocoon production to steadily increase...

    More than four years ago, the Dongchongfan mountainous area of ​​Luotian County, Hubei Province, was only accustomed to raising native silkworms. People did not believe that raising improved silkworms would increase silk production, and they were also afraid of losing money if they did not raise them well. Some people also found it troublesome and were unwilling to innovate silkworm rearing techniques. However, rural woman Lin Shuying was different. She broke with convention, boldly introduced excellent silkworm breeds from other places, and earnestly learned and improved silkworm rearing techniques. She increased silkworm cocoon production time and time again, and finally became a famous silkworm rearing model.

    In order to raise silkworms well, Lin Shuying often stayed in the silkworm room day and night, just like a mother caring for her children. She is good at selecting mulberry leaves suitable for various silkworms according to the growth and development of the silkworms. And she tirelessly wipes the mulberry leaves one by one, removing diseased leaves, withered leaves, and insect-eaten leaves, trying every possible means to ensure that the silkworms are well-fed. In the cold early spring or cool late autumn, she lit a warm fire in the silkworm room she managed, so that the silkworms would not be frostbitten; in the hot summer, she promptly put up a sunshade, installed fans, and sometimes even used cold water to cool them down, so that the silkworms would not be overheated. During the day, she tried to ensure that the silkworm room had sufficient sunlight and air; at night, she even specially lit lamps for the silkworms so that they could move freely. She also has the ability to identify sick silkworms. These sick silkworms need special care. Lin Shuying's entire mind and body are intertwined with the lives of the silkworms!

    In 1956, under the leadership of Lin Shuying, the Chongguang First Agricultural Production Cooperative where she was located, fully promoted improved silkworms. In the spring, 105 sheets of improved silkworms were raised, with an average yield of more than 75 catties and 8 taels of cocoons per sheet, creating a record of high-yield production over a large area in the province. In this way, she was selected as a provincial silkworm rearing model, and in 1957 she participated in the National Agricultural Labor Model Conference.

    The honor gave her a stronger sense of responsibility, which was to increase the production of more silk. Could silkworms be raised quickly? According to her experience, the most important issue in fast silkworm rearing is to master the appropriate temperature. She observed in various silkworm rooms day and night, constantly studying and solving the climate changes that occurred in the experiment, and finally shortened the silkworm rearing period by about a week, creating the national record for the highest single-yield of spring silkworm cocoons in 1957.

    On the basis of the success of fast silkworm rearing, Lin Shuying began to consider how to raise silkworms multiple times a year. Rice can be planted twice or three times a year, so can silkworms be raised in all four seasons? She boldly conducted experiments. After the spring silkworm harvest, she tried to raise four sheets of summer silkworms; then she experimented with autumn silkworms and late autumn silkworms. She constantly improved the feeding and management methods according to the climate, temperature, sunlight and other conditions; she also adopted a method of planned picking of mulberry leaves in all seasons to ensure the supply of silkworm food. These studies of hers were all successful, and seasonal silkworm rearing achieved bumper harvests in every season.

    In 1958, in addition to continuing to promote the four-season silkworm rearing method, Lin Shuying also carried out many valuable scientific research activities under the leadership of the Party branch. For example, adding glucose powder, soda powder, etc. to the feed to promote silkworm growth. These methods proved to be very effective: the silkworms grew white and fat, and the cocoons they spun were particularly thick, with a yield 19% to 21% higher than that of those that were not fed supplements.

    Lin Shuying is a person who is never complacent. In 1959, on the basis of raising silkworms four times a year, she studied and experimented with a multiple fast silkworm rearing method. She was determined to raise silkworms twelve times in a year. To realize this plan, the first problem encountered was how to solve the food problem? In addition to finding ways to save mulberry leaves, taking supplements, and finding substitutes to solve part of the food, she successfully experimented with the "anti-drying paper rearing method." This method can make silkworms mature earlier and shorten the silkworm rearing time, saving mulberry leaves and silkworm rearing labor. The experimental results were that eight of the twelve silkworm rearing sessions throughout the year achieved bumper harvests. Calculated on a per-sheet basis, the average cocoon yield of the eight harvests reached more than 178 catties and 8 taels.

    养蚕能手林淑英
    本报记者　殷平
    她是一个永不自满的人，一次又一次地改进养蚕技术，使蚕茧产量步步高升……
    四年多以前，湖北省罗田县东冲畈山区还只习惯养土蚕，人们不相信养改良蚕会增加丝的产量，也怕养不好要赔本；还有的人嫌麻烦，不愿革新养蚕技术。农村妇女林淑英却不是这样，她打破陈规，大胆引进外地优良蚕种，认真学习和改良养蚕的技术，一次又一次地提高了蚕茧产量，终于成为著名的养蚕模范。
    林淑英为了养好蚕，她经常是日夜不离蚕室，真像母亲抚育自己的孩子一般。她善于根据蚕的生长发育情况，选择适合各种不同蚕所需的桑叶来喂养。并且不厌其烦地一片一片地把桑叶拭干，除掉病叶、枯叶和虫叶，千方百计地让蚕吃饱吃好。在寒冷的初春或凉爽的深秋，她管理的蚕室里生起了温火，不让蚕受冻；在炎热的夏天，她又及时地搭上凉棚、安上风扇，有时还加用冷水降温，不让蚕受热。白天尽量让蚕室里有充足的阳光、空气；夜间还专门为蚕点上灯，让它们也能活动自如。她还有识别病蚕的本领。这些病蚕需要加以特别的护理。林淑英整个的心身和蚕的生活交织在一起了！
    1956年，林淑英所在的重光第一农业生产合作社，在她的倡导下，全部推广了改良蚕。春季养改良蚕一百零五张，每张平均产茧七十五斤八两多，创造了全省大面积高额丰产纪录。就这样，她被评选为全省养蚕模范，1957年又参加了全国农业劳动模范大会。
    荣誉给了她更强烈的责任感，那就是要增产更多的蚕丝，能不能快速养蚕？根据她的经验，快速养蚕最重要问题是掌握好适当的温度。她日夜不停地在各个蚕室观察，不断地研究和解决试验中发生的气候变化，终于使养蚕期缩短了一个星期左右，创造了1957年春蚕茧单产最高的全国纪录。
    在快速养蚕获得成功的基础上，林淑英又开始考虑怎样做到每年多养几次蚕的问题了。水稻能一年种两季、三季，养蚕能不能四季全养呢？她大胆地进行试验。在春蚕丰收后，她又试养四张夏蚕；接着又试验了秋蚕、晚秋蚕。她不断地根据气候、温度、阳光等条件，改进喂养和管理的方法；她还采取了四季桑叶有计划采摘的办法，保证蚕食的供应。她的这些研究都获得了成功，四季养蚕做到了季季丰收。
    1958年，林淑英除了继续推广四季养蚕法外，在党支部领导下，又进行了许多有价值的科学研究活动。比如用葡萄糖粉、苏打粉等添食来促进蚕的生长。这些办法证明很有效：蚕长得又白又胖，结的茧特别厚，产量比一般未添食的高出19％到21％。
    林淑英是一个永远不自满的人。1959年，她又在一年四次养蚕的基础上，研究和试验一年多次快速养蚕法。她决心在一年之内养十二次蚕。要实现这个计划，首先遇到的问题是食料问题如何解决？除了设法节约桑叶、采取添食、找代用品等办法解决一部分食料外，她试验成功了“防干纸育法”，这个方法可以提早使蚕成熟，缩短了养蚕时间，能节省桑叶和养蚕的劳动力。试验结果是，全年十二次养蚕有八次获得丰收，八次收获按每张计算，平均产茧量达一百七十八斤八两多。
