Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch: The Japanese "Forward Theatre" troupe performed traditional Kabuki plays "Shunkan" and "Narukami" at the Capital Theatre tonight.

Vice Premier Lu Dingyi attended the performance and met with the troupe leader of the "Forward Theatre," Kawarasaki Chojuro, deputy leaders Nakamura Ganemon, Miyakawa Gasei, and the main actors of the troupe during the intermission.

Also present at the meeting were Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of The Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, Yang Hansheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and Zhang Zhixiang, Deputy Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. Yasui Kaoru, director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, who is currently visiting China, and Japanese peace activist in Beijing, Kinkazu Saionji, were also present at the meeting.

Tonight's performance was warmly welcomed by the audience in the capital. "Shunkan" starred the famous actor Nakamura Ganemon, and the "Forward Theatre" troupe has performed this play more than two hundred times. The play expresses the spirit of struggling against the cruel oppression of the rulers and sacrificing oneself for others. "Narukami" is based on the theme of man's victory over gods and stars Kawarasaki Chojuro and Japan's famous female role male actor Kawarasaki Kunitaro. This play is being performed for the first time in China. The actors in both plays took multiple curtain calls amidst the warm applause of the audience.

After the performance, Vice Premier Lu Dingyi and others went on stage and shook hands cordially with the actors, congratulating them on their successful performance.

The "Forward Theatre" troupe has already performed four shows in Beijing, all of which have been extremely successful. The troupe will perform an additional show tomorrow night to repay the kindness of the audience in the capital.
