Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 4th: The Chenmen Commune in Minhou, Fujian Province, has launched a great inspection and great competition campaign for spring planting preparation, promoting advanced units and helping backward units. This is driving the commune's spring planting preparation work to a new high tide, ensuring a complete victory in the spring planting preparation movement, and striving for a bumper summer harvest.

Since the beginning of winter, the Chenmen Commune has achieved great results in the spring planting preparation movement, focusing on water, fertilizer, and soil. In order to ensure a complete victory in the spring planting preparation movement, the commune promptly organized a large-scale inspection and competition. Led by the Party Committee Secretary, it organized over one hundred people, including Party Branch Secretaries of the brigades, brigade leaders, model laborers, and experienced farmers, dividing them into seven groups to conduct mutual inspections and comparisons between brigades. Within the brigades, led by the Party Branch Secretaries, over one thousand one hundred cadres and members of the production teams carried out mass inspections and comparisons, going deep into the fields and construction sites to observe on the spot and exchange experiences. The main contents of the inspection and comparison revolved around manure accumulation and transportation, water conservancy construction, land preparation and deep plowing, spring sowing seeds, tool reform, and livestock protection, focusing on three key areas: first, remote fields; second, low-yield fields; and third, mountain fields, striving to eliminate all weak links.

During the inspection and comparison, the great achievements of the previous stage of spring planting preparation work were affirmed. Five advanced brigades and sixty-four advanced production teams were selected and awarded, and eight pacesetters were established for manure accumulation, fertilizer production, manure transportation, fertilizer conservation, deep plowing, water conservancy, and tool reform. One thousand one hundred and forty-one advanced commune members were commended. The inspection also revealed some weak links. For example, in terms of manure accumulation, it was found that 20% of the backward teams had not accumulated enough fertilizer to meet the needs of this year's agricultural leap forward, with too much coarse manure and too little fine manure. In terms of deep plowing, the quality of deep plowing in some fields did not meet the requirements, with a depth of only four to five inches, and 10% of the land was not fertilized after leveling. In terms of water conservancy, there were also some remaining problems that needed to be solved. According to the requirements of rational close planting, the commune is currently short more than 60,000 jin of improved seeds. The Commune Party Committee immediately led everyone to advance victoriously, quickly resolving these weak links, carrying out crash efforts to eliminate backward teams, and doing a good job in various spring planting preparation tasks for remote fields, low-yield fields, and mountain fields, ensuring the balanced development of spring planting preparation work. At the same time, they vigorously promoted tool reform around spring planting preparation production to improve labor efficiency.

A new spring planting preparation competition immediately formed a high tide in Chenmen Commune. The number of commune members involved in spring planting preparation increased from 5,460 to more than 8,200. Advanced teams strived to be even more advanced, and backward teams worked hard to catch up with the advanced. The Hongshan Brigade organized twelve specialized manure accumulation teams, striving to accumulate another 20 dan of fine manure per mu on the basis of the existing 39 dan of fine manure per mu, and excavated nine sources of fertilizer, accumulating 350,000 dan of soil fertilizer. While vigorously accumulating manure, all teams focused on transporting manure, and the commune rushed to build 142 ox carts and 330 flatbed carts, greatly accelerating the progress of manure transportation. The teams also rushed to complete the finishing work of land leveling and water conservancy projects, and the deep plowing specialized teams continued to carry out the second plowing. Mutual assistance and cooperation were carried out between teams to adjust surpluses and shortages, ensuring that each team had sufficient spring planting seeds. The brigades paid special attention to the spring planting preparation work of backward teams and backward fields. In order to help the Loushang Brigade, which had accumulated less fine manure, catch up with the advanced, the Commune Party Committee specially organized Liu Shuquan, the Party Branch Secretary of the Hongshan Brigade, who had rich experience in manure accumulation, and a fertilizer production expert, to go to the Loushang Brigade to pass on fertilizer production experience. As a result, the Loushang Brigade organized a specialized fertilizer production team, accumulating 110,000 dan of surrogate human manure, increasing the amount of fine manure from 15 dan per mu to 30 dan. All one thousand two hundred and ten mu of low-yield fields and one thousand and eight mu of mountain fields, as well as more than two thousand mu of remote land, have been transformed. The low-yield fields have also been fertilized in layers and the soil layer has been thickened in conjunction with the second deep plowing; mountain fields and remote fields have adopted the method of accumulating manure locally, accumulating large amounts of mountain topsoil, and digging fertilizer pits on the spot to ferment various fertilizers, ensuring that all kinds of fields can win a bumper summer harvest.

    大检查大评比  推先进帮后进
    福建城门公社消灭备耕薄弱环节
    本报福州4日电　福建省闽侯城门公社开展备耕大检查大评比，推先进帮后进，把全社备耕工作推向新高潮，确保备耕运动的全胜，力争夏季大丰收。
    城门公社入冬以来，以水、肥土为中心的备耕运动，已获得很大成绩。为了确保备耕运动的全胜，公社及时地组织大检查、大评比，由党委书记挂帅，组织大队党支部书记、大队长、劳动模范、老农等一百多人，分为七片，开展大队与大队之间的互查互比；大队以下由党支部书记挂帅，组织生产队干部、社员一千一百多人，开展群众性的检查评比，并深入田间，深入工地，实地观摩，就地交流经验。检查评比主要内容是围绕积肥运肥、兴修水利、整地深翻、春播种子、工具改革、保护牧畜等方面，并抓住了三个重点：一是边远田，二是低产田，三是山田，力争消灭各个薄弱环节。
    在检查评比中，肯定了前段备耕工作的巨大成绩，评比出了五个备耕先进大队，六十四个先进生产队，分别竖起了积肥、造肥、运肥、保肥和深翻、水利、工具改革等八项标兵，表扬了一千一百四十一个先进社员。检查中也发现了一些薄弱环节。例如在积肥方面，发现尚有20％的落后队，已积肥料还不能适应今年农业新跃进的需要，粗肥积得多，精肥积得少。在深翻方面，部分田地的深翻质量也没有达到要求，深度仅有四至五寸，10％的土地整平以后也没有加施肥土。在水利方面，也有一些遗留问题需要解决。根据合理密植要求，目前全社尚缺六万多斤良种。公社党委立即领导大家乘胜前进，迅速解决这些薄弱环节，突击消灭落后队，作好边远田、低产田、山田的各项备耕工作，保证备耕工作的平衡发展；同时围绕备耕生产大搞工具改革，提高劳动效率。
    一个新的备耕大竞赛立即在城门公社迅速形成高潮。全社投入备耕的社员由五千四百六十人增至八千二百多人，先进队力争更先进，落后的队大赶先进。红山大队组织了十二个积肥专业队，力争在现有每亩积精肥三十九担的基础上，再积二十担精肥，并挖掘了九处肥源，积了土肥三十五万担。在大搞积肥的同时，各队大抓运肥，全社赶造了牛车一百四十二部、板车三百三十部、大大加快了运肥进度。各队还突击完成了平整土地、水利工程的扫尾工作，深翻专业队继续进行了第二次翻犁。队与队之间还开展互助协作，进行余缺调剂，作到队队备足春耕良种。各大队对落后队、落后田的备耕工作特别抓紧。公社党委为了帮助精肥积得少的胪上大队赶上先进，特地组织富有积肥经验的红山大队党支部书记、造肥能手刘述铨等到胪上大队，传授造肥经验，于是胪上大队组织了造肥专业队，积造了代人粪十一万担，使精肥量由每亩十五担跃到三十担。全社一千二百一十亩低产田和一千零八亩山田以及二千多亩边远的土地，都已进行了改造。低产田还结合二次深翻，进行了分层施肥，加厚土层；山田、边远田则采取就地积肥的办法，大量积施山皮土，就地挖掘肥坑沤制各种肥料，确保各种田地都能夺得夏季大丰收。
