    Creation
    Soviet Union, I. Yudovich
    These days, all kinds of letters and telegrams are flying to the Rostov newspaper offices from many cities and villages across the Soviet Union. The Don River region can be said to be fervently discussing the brilliant creation that marks a new face of communism everywhere.

    What kind of creation is it that the whole Soviet Union is talking about?

    Amateur Free Medical Care by Medical Experts
    Not long ago, four medical experts from the Rostov Medical Institute—Professor Kovalenko, Professor Nikolsky, Professor Davydov, and Associate Doctor of Medicine Skvortsov—published a short letter in the Rostov newspapers. In this letter, they wrote: "We, the scientific workers of the Medical Institute, wholeheartedly support learning from the outstanding movement of Gaganova. We are determined to contribute to the improvement of medical services for the working people of Rostov City and Rostov Oblast. Each of us has decided to provide medical consultations at various hospitals in the city in addition to our main teaching work. We believe that this is not only beneficial to the patients but also beneficial to the medical staff, as they often feel a lack of strong guidance from experts. We suggest that all medical experts in Rostov follow our example. Let there be no more private practice in our lives. This remnant left over from the old society can and should be ended now."

    The initiators of this creation are all highly respected figures in the city. For example, Kovalenko is a very famous surgeon whose agile and skillful heart surgery amazes even experienced medical experts. Professor Nikolsky is a pivotal expert in neurosurgery. Professor Davydov is a well-known pediatrician, a traditional physician; his father was also a professor and doctor of medicine.

    Rostov is a large city in southern Soviet Union, a port of five seas. The city has more than two hundred industrial enterprises of all kinds, a comprehensive university and six other higher education institutions, many secondary specialized schools and ordinary schools, and various cultural venues. To serve the 500,000 citizens, Rostov has established a dense network of hospitals and clinics, with thousands of doctors. As for medical clinics with diagnostic laboratories and X-ray rooms, every larger enterprise has one.

    The four initiators have many followers. In the large collective of the Medical Institute, no scholar has stayed outside the new and significant movement.

    University professors have appeared in various hospitals in the city. One evening, we visited several hospitals. Professor Ivanov was receiving patients in the outpatient department of the Second Lenin Hospital. He was intently listening to the heart of an old woman. According to her own account, she had heart pain after suffering from laryngitis. The professor wrote a prescription, gave instructions to the patient, and after the patient left, explained to the attending district doctor what further assistance she needed.

    At the same time, Professor Torsuyev was receiving patients in the Dermatology Hospital. He had recently returned from China, where he had studied a malignant disease called leprosy with his Chinese brother doctors. Medical experts from various departments formed three consultation groups and conducted consultations and treatments in the Rostov Agricultural Machinery Factory, the "Red Aksai" Factory, and other large enterprises in the city. Soon, Rostov will open an unusual hospital. All the work of this hospital is of a social nature. The leaders of each department are professors, doctors, and associate doctors. The positions of intermediate and junior medical staff are held by senior students of the Medical Institute, which is an excellent internship for them.

    The most experienced doctors in Taganrog, Novocherkassk, Donetsk, and other cities in the oblast are learning from the good example of these medical experts. They have formed outpatient groups to provide medical care in their spare time and help young experts who have just graduated from university and come to work in hospitals.

    Professors Go to Factories for Tutoring
    Another piece of news soon spread throughout the entire Rostov Oblast. The staff of the Rostov Railway Engineering Institute inherited and promoted this new patriotic movement and proposed an initiative that further stirred the city's intellectuals.

    One day, a notice was posted at the Lenin Locomotive Repair Factory: "The Railway Engineering Institute has established a tutoring station for inventions and rationalization proposals in our factory. From now on, every Wednesday, professors and associate professors from the institute will be on duty in the factory's technical office."

    On the first Wednesday, Professor Malozemov of the Railway Engineering Institute received many visitors. Fitter Mashukin came to discuss how to speed up the processing of sleeves. Another innovator, Milevsky, brought his calculations for the professor to review, which could save a lot of valuable bronze. Several engineers raised their extremely headache-inducing problems to Malozemov for advice. They simply could not figure out how to remove the thick scale from the locomotive cylinder heads. On this day and every subsequent Wednesday, the factory's production staff received a great deal of valuable advice.

    At the same time, the Railway Engineering Institute opened a workers' department at the Lenin Locomotive Repair Factory. The department has a total of four classes, with more than 150 students. They will complete the courses prescribed by the higher education institutions in two years, according to their individual specialties. The teachers here are the scholars of the Railway Engineering Institute, and they do not receive any compensation. I visited the school and saw how model worker Gordienko, smelter Ryazanov, foreman Lavenkov, fitter Kosikov, and others were attentively listening to the scholars' lectures.

    The staff of the Railway Engineering Institute also founded an unusual department in the factory. On the railway, steam locomotives will soon be completely eliminated. They will be replaced by internal combustion locomotives and electric locomotives. Therefore, engineering and technical personnel must also undergo a more thorough refresher course. The Railway Engineering Institute has specially opened a department for them. Thirty engineers filled the lecture hall after work. Professor Kalminsky lectured on the technological progress in transportation and the performance of new locomotives. The classroom was silent. The engineers bowed their heads over their notebooks, listening and taking notes. The new form of auxiliary production, born to meet the needs of real life, won universal praise. The initiative of the Railway Engineering Institute was immediately responded to and supported by other higher education institutions, research institutes, experimental stations, and technical schools.

      Creation Flows Like a Spring
    In the Soviet Union, scientists and practical workers have always maintained creative cooperation. Now this excellent cooperation is even more consolidated.

    Rostov University established a tutoring station for inventions and rationalization proposals, staffed by scholars in physics, chemistry, and geology. The Rostov Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Institute opened a University of Technical Knowledge for leaders of industrial enterprises. Scholars from the Architectural Engineering Institute specially opened a department for architectural innovators. The Rostov Institute of Machine Manufacturing Technology established a tutoring station to help communist labor teams solve all technical problems. The Azov-Black Sea Agricultural Institute near Novocherkassk has sent five scholar work teams to the countryside to help collective farms and state farms.

    Many middle school teachers in Rostov went to factories to help young workers prepare for university and secondary technical school entrance exams. A large group of scholars in the university gave reports to residents and refused to accept compensation.

    Creation is flowing like a spring, and its inspiring source will never dry up. And all of this is done consciously and voluntarily. In this new era, new people are emerging, and new social phenomena are emerging in an endless stream.

    创举
    苏联依·尤多维奇
    在这些日子里，各式各样的信件和电报，从苏联全国的许多城市和乡村，纷纷飞向罗斯托夫的各家报社。顿河流域可以说无处不在热烈地谈论着标志共产主义新气象的光辉创举。
    这究竟是什么样的创举，使苏联全国到处都在谈论呢？
    医学家业余免费看病
    不久前，罗斯托夫医学院的四位医学家——科瓦连科教授、尼科尔斯基教授、达维多夫教授和斯克沃尔佐夫医学副博士，在罗斯托夫各报上发表了一封短信，他们在这封信中写道：“我们，医学院的科学工作者，衷心拥护学习加干诺娃的卓越运动。决心为改善罗斯托夫市和罗斯托夫州劳动人民的医疗服务工作作出贡献。我们每个人决定在主要教学工作之余，到市内各医院看病。我们相信，这样做不仅对患者有利，而且对医务工作有利，因为他们常常感到缺少专家的有力指导。我们建议罗斯托夫全体医学家仿效我们的榜样。让我们的生活中不再有私人行医。旧社会遗留下来的这种残余，现在可以结束、而且也应当结束了。”
    这个创举的发起者都是市里名负重望的人物。比如，科瓦连科是一位很著名的外科医生，他敏捷而灵巧的心脏手术使有经验的医学家感到惊服。尼科尔斯基教授是神经外科方面举足轻重的专家。达维多夫教授则是有名的儿科专家，他是一位祖传医师，他父亲也是一位教授、医学博士。
    罗斯托夫是苏联南方一个大城市，为五海之港。市内有二百多家各行工业企业，一所综合性大学和六所其他高等学校、许多中等专业学校和普通学校，各种各样的文化场所。为了给五十万市民服务，罗斯托夫市建立了密布的医院和诊疗所网，拥有数千名医生。至于设有诊断试验室和X光室的医务所，则每个较大的企业都有。
    四位发起人有很多追随者。在医学院这个大集体里，没有一个学者置身于新的具有重大意义的运动之外。
    大学教授在市内各医院出现了。有一天晚上，我们访问了几家医院。在列宁医院第二院门诊部接待病人的是伊万诺夫教授。他正全神贯注地为一老妇听诊。根据她自诉，患喉头炎之后，心脏疼痛。教授开了处方，向病人做了叮嘱，等病人走后，教授把她还需要些什么帮助，向在场的区段医生作了交代。
    也就在这个时候，托尔苏耶夫教授正在皮肤病医院接待病人。他最近刚从中国回来，曾和兄弟的中国医生共同研究了一种叫麻疯病的恶症。各科医学专家组成了三个会诊组，分头在罗斯托夫农业机器厂、“红色阿克赛”工厂和市内其他大企业进行诊疗。再过不久，罗斯托夫就要开设一座不寻常的医院。这个医院的全部工作都是社会工作性质。各科的领导都由教授、博士、副博士担任。至于中级和初级医务人员的职务则由医学院高年级生执行，这对于他们是一种极好的实习。
    塔干罗格、诺沃切尔卡斯克、顿涅茨克和本州其他城市的最富经验的医生们都在学习这几位医学家的良好榜样。他们成立了门诊组，在业余时间看病，帮助刚出大学校门来到医院工作的青年专家。
    教授下工厂进行辅导
    又有一个消息很快传遍了全罗斯托夫州。罗斯托夫铁道工程学院工作人员继承并发扬了这个新的爱国运动，提出了使全市知识界为之更加震动的倡议。
    有一次列宁机车修理厂贴出了这样一张通知：“铁道工程学院在本厂成立了发明创造和合理化建议辅导站。今后每逢星期三，有该校的教授和副教授在本厂技术室值班。”
    在头一个星期三，铁道工程学院马洛捷莫夫教授就接见了许多来访者。钳工马书金来商量怎样加快套管加工速度。另一位革新家米列夫斯基拿来自己的计算书给教授审查，根据这份计算书可以节省许多贵重的青铜。有几位工程师把他们极感头疼的问题提出来向马洛捷莫夫请教。他们硬是想不出排除机车汽缸盖厚垢皮的办法。工厂的生产人员在这一天和以后的每个星期三，都得到了许许多多的宝贵意见。
    同时，铁道工程学院在列宁机车修理厂开办了一个工人系。这个系共有四个班，学员一百五十多名。他们将根据个人的专业，利用两年的时间，学完高等学校规定的课程。在这里任教的就是铁道工程学院的学者们，而且他们完全不要报酬。我参观了学校上课的情形，看见模型工高尔季英科、熔炼工梁赞诺夫、工长拉文科夫、钳工科西科夫等人是如何专心致志地在听学者们讲课。
    铁道工程学院的工作人员还在工厂里创办了一个不平常的系。在铁路上，蒸汽机车很快就要完全淘汰了。它们将被内燃机车、电气机车代替。因此工程技术人员也非来一次较彻底的进修不可。铁道工程学院就为他们特别开办了一个系。三十名工程师下班后坐满了讲堂。这天由卡尔明斯基教授上课。他讲的是交通运输方面的技术进步、新型机车的性能。课堂里鸦雀无声。工程师们头俯在笔记本上，坐在那里一边听讲一边做笔记。适应现实生活需要而诞生的辅助生产的新形式，博得了普遍的赞扬。铁道工程学院的创举立即得到其他高等学校、研究所、试验站、技术学校的响应和支持。
      创举像泉水一样奔流
    在苏联，科学家和实际工作者之间总保持着创造性的合作。如今这种卓越的合作更加巩固了。
    罗斯托夫大学由该校物理、化学、地质学方面的学者成立了发明创造和合理化建议辅导站。罗斯托夫农业机器制造学院为工业企业领导人员开办了一所技术知识大学。建筑工程学院的学者为建筑革新家专门开设了一个系。罗斯托夫机器制造工艺研究所设立了帮助共产主义劳动队解决一切技术问题的辅导站。诺沃切尔卡斯克附近的亚速黑海农学院，已派出五个学者工作队到农村帮助集体农庄和国营农场。
    罗斯托夫的许多中学教师都下厂帮助青工准备投考大学和中等技术学校。大学里有很大一批学者向居民做报告，而拒绝接受报酬。
    创举像泉水一样在奔流，它的具有鼓舞力量的源泉永不枯竭。而这一切所做所为都出于自觉自愿。在这新的时代里，新人辈出，新的社会现象也层出不穷。
