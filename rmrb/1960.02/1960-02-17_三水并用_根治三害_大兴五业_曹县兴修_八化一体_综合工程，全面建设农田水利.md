    Jinan, February 16th (Our Newspaper) — The Chengguan People's Commune in Cao County, Shandong Province, has built an "Eight-Transformation Integrated" comprehensive farmland water conservancy system. The project is of enormous scale and benefits in many ways. It can comprehensively grasp the sky, underground, and river water, implementing a "triple insurance" of using three waters together. It can also prevent drought, drain floods, improve saline-alkali soil, eradicate "three harms," and promote the prosperity of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. It has established a red flag for the comprehensive basic construction of farmland in flat, low-lying, and waterlogged areas. Now, the people's communes in Cao County are rapidly expanding this pilot project to the entire county.
    Cao County, bordering the abandoned Yellow River to the south, is a boundless alluvial plain. Drought, flooding, and alkali have always been formidable enemies of agricultural production here. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the local people built some water conservancy projects, but due to the small scale of organization and insufficient strength, the three harms were not eradicated. In 1958, the people's communes were born, and the eighteen people's communes in the county cooperated on a large scale, first launching the "Eight-Transformation Integrated" pilot project in the Chengguan Commune, severing the three chains of drought, flooding, and alkali that had bound agricultural production for thousands of years. The characteristics of this project are comprehensive planning, comprehensive management, a combination of large-scale and small-scale projects, a combination of river diversion and well drilling, simultaneous elimination of harms and promotion of benefits, and comprehensive development of water, fertilizer, soil, and forests. The "Eight-Transformation Integrated" complete set of water conservancy projects includes plain river network, ubiquitous mechanized wells, self-flowing irrigation, farmland transformed into gardens, hydropower electrification, diversified aquaculture, great earth afforestation, and transportation canalization and highway construction. In this way, the entire land is interwoven with river networks, canal networks, forest networks, highway networks, and scattered power stations and mechanized wells, forming a complete system.
    The "Eight-Transformation Integrated" project has considerable thoroughness in flood control and drought resistance. If it encounters a continuous downpour of 600 to 800 millimeters over seven to ten days, it can ensure that every mu of farmland is free from flood damage. If it encounters a severe drought, with no rain falling for a year, it can also ensure the water needed for crops, and it can also transform alkaline land into fertile land. The "Eight-Transformation Integrated" project has such great power because it has abundant water volume from the combined use of rivers, canals, and wells, and a complete project with the interaction of storage, irrigation, drainage, and suppression (diverting water to suppress alkali).
    The pilot area of the Chengguan Commune has a total area of 39 square kilometers, and the total runoff is 7.6 million cubic meters, while the 83 river networks (total length of 270 li) of the fourth, fifth, and sixth levels can store 6.732 million cubic meters, and the remaining 868,000 cubic meters of water can also be adjusted through the river network. Therefore, a rainfall of 600 millimeters in ten days can also avoid flood disasters. This project is even more powerful in drought removal. The 27,200 mu of cultivated land in the pilot area, if calculated according to the maximum annual water demand of 700 cubic meters per mu in a year without rain, requires a total of 19.045 million cubic meters. The "Eight-Transformation Integrated" project can control rivers, runoff, and groundwater to jointly manage the drought demon. The Taihangdi Reservoir can divert 7.43 million cubic meters of Yellow River water annually; rivers and canals can usually store 1.6 million cubic meters of water; and mechanized wells can extract 10 million cubic meters of water. The three water sources total 19.03 million cubic meters, an annual average of nearly 700 cubic meters per mu, and it can be thoroughly irrigated every five to seven days, which can completely achieve the requirement of ensuring a good harvest in a year without rain. The sixth-level river network built in the pilot area can not only prevent flooding but also divert water to suppress alkali and drain alkali, which can transform alkaline land into fertile land.
    In order to give full play to the potential of water and soil resources, achieve free irrigation and drainage, combined storage and drainage, and convenient transportation, they adopted the "one-one-five" system of drainage, irrigation, and cultivation and the parallel operation of rivers, roads, and canals, with one line carrying eight transformations, and various projects were carried out simultaneously. The "one-one-five" system is designed according to the irrigation of 10,000 mu by the branch canal, 1,000 mu by the farm canal, and 50 mu by the capillary canal. Each level of canal must have a considerable spacing, length, and its control range. In practice, a river network is dug on the water-facing side, roads are built using the abandoned soil in the middle, and canals are built on the backwater side. Rivers above the fifth level are excavated on both sides, with one side building a road and the other building a forest belt. In this way, rivers, roads, and canals can be built at one time. It is not only convenient for irrigation, drainage, and alkali drainage, but also convenient for transportation and mechanized farming.
    The "Eight-Transformation Integrated" project has considerable scientificity. Water, fertilizer, soil, and forests are organically combined and complementary to each other. Various projects have a reasonable division of labor and strict organization, saving labor and materials. For example, in order to meet the needs of storage, irrigation, drainage, navigation, highways, hydropower, and aquaculture, the Chengguan Commune pilot area divided the river network into six levels. River networks above the third level are responsible for water transfer, water storage, navigation, power generation, etc. The fourth and fifth levels are responsible for water storage, irrigation, field transportation, and fish farming, and the sixth level is an alkali drainage ditch. In construction, canals and rivers are generally used in parallel. Canals of various levels are attached to the sides of river networks of various levels, controlled by buildings, and connected to each other. The distribution of buildings adopts the method of centralized control with one bridge carrying a sluice gate. The mechanized wells all over the canal heads of each farm canal are attached with a sunning pool to raise the water temperature, and then the water flows to the fields through the farm canal by gravity. Wells and rivers use a set of canal systems to irrigate the land.
    The "Eight-Transformation Integrated" pilot project is the product of the shining of the general line. At the beginning, a few people advocated only carrying out river dredging and flood prevention projects and were not interested in benefit-generating projects such as building reservoirs and canals; others believed that the "Eight-Transformation Integrated" project was large in scale and could only be initially treated at present and could be fundamentally cured in the future. Under the leadership of the higher party committee, the county's party organization took the Chengguan Commune as a pilot project, resolutely led the masses, held high the red flag of the general line, and acted while debating, so that the "Eight-Transformation Integrated" project was completed in just forty days. The amount of land occupied by river dredging and canal construction was also compressed to the lowest limit. This fact shows that as long as you have lofty ambitions and seriously deal with a specific problem, you can do things quickly and well.
    At the same time, the construction of this pilot project and its rapid expansion fully demonstrate the strong strength of the people's commune. In the process of launching the "Eight-Transformation Integrated" pilot project, the people's communes in the county mobilized 24,000 laborers. If they did not have technology, they learned it themselves; if they did not have explosives, they made it themselves; if they did not have materials, they raised it themselves. They successively established more than 210 cement plants, lime plants, water conservancy tool manufacturing and repair plants, explosive plants, brick kilns, etc. In order to rapidly popularize the "Eight-Transformation Integrated" project throughout the county, the county party committee has launched a large-scale water conservancy construction campaign since last winter. At present, the county has repaired 2,740 main, branch, bucket, and farm canals, with a total length of more than 14,700 li, and completed the gravity irrigation canal system project 20 days ahead of schedule; more than 80% of the county's cultivated land has been transformed into gardens. At the same time, the county also built fish ponds, drilled mechanized wells, afforested 7.7 million trees on the sides of more than 1,800 parallel canals, roads, and rivers, and built 16 hydropower stations (with a power generation capacity of 306 kilowatts). A total of more than 29.78 million cubic meters of earthwork was completed in 70 days, exceeding the winter plan by nearly one and a half times.

    三水并用　根治三害　大兴五业
    曹县兴修“八化一体”综合工程，全面建设农田水利
    平原河网化，遍地机井化，灌溉自流化，耕地园田化，水力电气化，水产多样化，大地园林化，交通运输舟船化和公路化
    本报济南16日电　山东曹县城关人民公社建成“八化一体”农田水利综合工程系统。工程规模巨大，一举多利，既可全面抓住天上、地下、河流水，实行三水并用“三保险”，又能防旱、排涝、改碱，根除“三害”，使农、林、牧、副、渔五业俱兴，为平原洼涝地区全面进行农田基本建设树立了一面红旗。现在，曹县各人民公社正在把这一试点工程迅速地扩展到全县。
    曹县南靠废黄河，是一望无际的冲积平原。旱、涝、碱三害向为这里农业增产的劲敌。解放后，当地人民在党的领导下，修建了一些水利工程，但由于组织规模小力量不足，三害仍未根除。1958年人民公社诞生，全县十八个人民公社大协作，首先在城关公社创办了“八化一体”试点工程，斩断了千百年来束缚农业增产的旱、涝、碱三条锁链。这项工程的特点是，全面规划，综合治理，大型工程和小型工程结合，引河修渠和打井结合，除害和兴利同时并举，水肥土林全面开发。“八化一体”整套水利工程包括平原河网化，遍地机井化，灌溉自流化，耕地园田化，水力电气化，水产多样化，大地园林化，交通运输舟船化和公路化。这样，整个大地被河网、渠网、林网、公路网和星罗棋布的电站、机井交织起来，形成一个完整的体系。
    “八化一体”工程在排涝抗旱上具有相当的彻底性。如果遇到七至十天连续降六百到八百毫米的暴雨，它可以保证亩亩农田不受涝害；如果碰上酷旱天，一年滴雨不落，也可保证农作物需要的水分，并且还可以把碱地改造成良田。“八化一体”工程所以有此巨大威力，是因为它具有河、渠、井三水并用的充沛水量和蓄、灌、排、压（引水压碱）相互作用的完备工程。
    城关公社试点区总面积三十九平方公里，总径流量是七百六十万立方米，而四、五、六级八十三条河网（总长二百七十里）工程就可拦蓄六百七十三万二千立方米，其余八十六万八千立方米水还能通过河网予以调剂。因此十天降雨六百毫米，也可免除涝灾。这个工程在除旱方面则更有威力。试点区的二万七千二百多亩耕地，如按一年无雨最大需水量每亩七百立方计算，共需一千九百零四万五千立方米。“八化一体”工程则可控制河水、径流水、地下水等三水共治旱魔。计太行堤水库每年可引黄河水七百四十三万立方米；河渠平时能蓄水一百六十万立方米；机井可提水一千万立方米。三项水源共计一千九百零三万立方米，每亩年平均近七百立方米，而且五至七天就能透浇一遍，完全可以达到一年无雨保丰收的要求。试点区建的六级河网，不仅可以防涝，还可以引水压碱和排碱，能够把碱地改造成良田。
    为了充分发挥水、土资源潜力，达到灌排自如、蓄泄兼施、便利交通，他们在施工中采用了排、灌、耕作“一一五”制和河、路、渠并行，一行带八化，各项工程同时并举的作法。“一一五”制是按斗渠灌溉一万亩，农渠灌溉一千亩，毛渠灌溉五十亩进行设计划方。各级渠道都要有相当的间距、长度和它的控制范围。在作法上，迎水面挖河网，当中利用弃土筑路，背水面筑渠道。五级以上河网两面出土，一面筑路一面建林带。这样做法，河流、道路、水渠可以一次建成。既便利灌溉，排涝和排碱，又便利交通，便利机耕。
    “八化一体”工程具有相当的科学性，水、肥、土、林有机结合，相辅相成，各项工程分工合理，组织严密，省工省料。例如为了满足蓄、灌、排、航和公路、水电、水产等方面的需要，城关公社试点区把河网分为六级，三级以上河网担负调水、蓄水、航运、发电等，四、五级担负蓄水、灌溉、田间运输、养鱼，六级为排碱沟。在施工中，一般采用渠、河并列，在各级河网旁附设各级渠道，有建筑物控制，互相通联。建筑物的分布采用了集中控制一桥带闸的办法。遍布各条农渠渠首旁边的机井，都附设一个晒水池，将水提入池内，提高水温，再经过农渠自流田间，井、河利用一套渠系浇地。
    “八化一体”试点工程，是总路线光辉照耀下的产物。开始，少数人主张只搞挖河防涝工程，对修水库、筑水渠等兴利工程不感兴趣；也有的认为“八化一体”工程量大，目前只能初治，将来才能根治。这个县的党组织在上级党委的领导下，以城关公社为试点，坚决地领导群众，高举总路线的红旗，边辩论边行动，使“八化一体”工程在短短四十天中就修成了。修河修渠占用土地量，也压缩到最低限度。这一事实说明，只要有雄心大志，又认真对待某一个具体问题，就可以把事情办得快办得好。
    同时，这项试点工程的兴建及它的迅速扩展，充分显示了人民公社的雄厚力量。全县各人民公社在创办“八化一体”试点工程中，调集二万四千名劳力，没有技术自己学，没有炸药自己造，没有料物自己筹，先后办起的水泥厂、石灰厂、水利工具制修厂、炸药厂、砖窑等二百一十多处。县委为了迅速把“八化一体”工程普及全县，去冬以来，展开了大规模的水利建设运动。现在全县已修整干、支、斗、农渠二千七百四十条，长达一万四千七百多里，提前二十天完成了自流灌溉渠系工程；全县80％以上的耕地实现了园田化。与此同时，全县还大修鱼塘，打机井，在一千八百多条并行的渠、路、河旁造林七百七十万株，建水电站十六座（发电量三百零六瓩）。总计七十天完成土方二千九百七十八万多方，超过冬季计划近一倍半。
