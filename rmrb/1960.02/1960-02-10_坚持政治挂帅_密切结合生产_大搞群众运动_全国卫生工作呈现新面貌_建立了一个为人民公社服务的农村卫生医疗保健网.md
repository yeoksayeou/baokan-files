Adhere to Putting Politics in Command, Closely Integrate with Production, Vigorously Carry Out Mass Movements
National Health Work Presents a New Look
Establish a Rural Health and Medical Care Network Serving the People's Communes

(Our report) Under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line and inspired by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee's opposition to Right deviation and encouragement of greater efforts, China's health undertakings in 1959 adhered to putting politics in command, serving production, closely integrating with production, and vigorously carrying out mass movements. Based on the Great Leap Forward of 1958, it achieved great accomplishments.

Over the past year, the mass health movement centered on eliminating the four pests, emphasizing hygiene, and eliminating major diseases has been carried out more extensively and deeply. In cities and villages, in factories and communes... the broad masses, based on the laws of disease occurrence and development and closely combined with the experience gained over the past few years, have launched wave after wave of health movements since the spring, which were both vigorous and down-to-earth. More and more advanced units and regions have emerged from point to area. Advanced regions such as Jishan in Shanxi, Dengfeng in Henan, Jieshou in Anhui, and Rizhao in Shandong, where diseases have been basically eliminated and the sanitary environment has been completely renewed, have emerged.

Due to the improvement of sanitary conditions and the development of mass sanitation and prevention work, the incidence of many epidemics and seasonal infectious diseases has been greatly reduced. In Jieshou County, Anhui Province, 231 villages without infectious diseases appeared. In Taiyang Village, Jishan County, Shanxi Province, no infectious diseases have been prevalent for several years. Factories and mines have also greatly reduced the incidence of diseases by paying attention to dust prevention, heatstroke prevention, and anti-poisoning, and strengthening the prevention and treatment of occupational poisoning and common diseases in factories and mines. All these achievements have greatly improved attendance rates and directly supported production. The Yuecheng Reservoir construction site in Hebei Province is a large construction site with 200,000 migrant workers. Since the start of construction, it has insisted on carrying out health campaigns, and no epidemics have occurred. The incidence of migrant workers' illnesses has dropped from 1.3% in the initial stage of construction to 0.8%, and the attendance rate has increased from 95% to 98%. The accelerated treatment of several parasitic diseases that are most harmful to the people, as well as patients with endemic diseases in various places, has restored a large number of patients to health and returned them to production posts, which is also a huge support for production. For example, in 1959, more than 900,000 schistosomiasis patients were treated, and the total number of patients treated in previous years reached 4.9 million, of which 3.5 million have been cured. In the epidemic areas where the god of plague has been sent away, a thriving scene has emerged.

Over the past year, in terms of health organization construction, due to the implementation of the "walking on two legs" policy of combining urban and rural areas, combining large, medium and small sizes, combining state-run and commune-run, combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and combining popularization and improvement, closely integrating with production and construction, especially with the consolidation and sound development of the people's communes, health care organizations have also developed greatly. At present, the number of formal hospital beds in the country has reached more than 570,000, an increase of about 30% compared with 1958, and a large number of simple beds and family beds have been continued to be run. Due to the increasing consolidation and sound development of the people's communes, the development of health undertakings has also been powerfully promoted. A rural health and medical care network that serves the communes, is owned by the communes, and is centered on the communes has been initially established and is becoming increasingly sound. At present, there are more than 200,000 commune-run hospitals and clinics. Communes have health centers (hospitals) and maternity hospitals, many production teams have health stations or health care stations, and production teams have health rooms (health care rooms) composed of non-detached or semi-detached personnel. In addition to full-time health personnel, a large number of non-detached health workers, midwives, child care workers, cooks, and feeders have been trained as mass health backbones and activists. Because medical personnel go deep into the fields, construction sites, canteens, nurseries, homes for the elderly, and other collective production and living places to actively carry out medical and preventive work and provide health technical guidance, rural medical and health conditions have been greatly improved, and health care work in collective production and life has been strengthened.

In terms of cadre training, the number of students enrolled in higher medical colleges and universities across the country has reached more than 90,000, an increase of more than 20% compared with 1958. The number of students enrolled in secondary health schools has reached more than 150,000. In addition, a large number of intermediate and primary health personnel have been trained for the communes through the large-scale development of spare-time secondary and primary health schools and the method of traditional Chinese and Western medicine teaching apprentices. This method of combining uniformity and diversity, combining popularization and improvement, and combining overall planning and local decentralization not only mobilized the positive factors of running schools in many aspects, expanded the medical education front, and accelerated the growth of the health team, but also enabled cadre training to be closely integrated with production and adapt to the urgent needs of the people's communes, so as to better serve the elimination of pests and diseases and ensure production construction and people's health.

With the vigorous development of health undertakings, medical scientific research in 1959 is also developing rapidly. The number of professional research institutions increased by 86.3% compared with 1958, and the number of professional personnel engaged in research work also increased significantly. Due to the conscientious implementation of the Party's policy of scientific research serving production and the integration of theory with practice, adopting the "walking on two legs" approach and vigorously carrying out mass movements, the achievements of medical scientific research work, both in terms of quantity and quality, far exceeded any previous year. For example, Shanghai completed more than 3,000 scientific research projects in 1959, which was twice the original plan and more than doubled the research results of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The great achievements of medical scientific work in 1959 are manifested in: First, extensive and large-scale mass scientific activities were carried out, such as the completion of medicinal plant and people's commune nutrition surveys nationwide, and a large number of general surveys of silicosis, hypertension, and tumors were conducted, providing scientific basis and important data for further disease prevention and treatment; Second, traditional Chinese and Western medicine cooperated more closely, actively conducted clinical and theoretical research on traditional Chinese medicine, summarized the treatment rules of many diseases, and improved the medical effect, such as using integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine therapy to control hypertension with new ideas, and the research on the essence of meridians and the mechanism of acupuncture also had a good start; Third, combined with modern medical theory, a large number of prevention and treatment experiences and folk remedies were summarized, so that practice rose to theory. A set of scientific and technological methods for eliminating the five major parasitic diseases has now been summarized and mastered. For example, the three-day therapy for schistosomiasis has not only been fully proven by the practice of curing more than 3 million patients, but also created new theoretical viewpoints. Key research has also been conducted on the experience of using native methods to eliminate pests and diseases, such as the treatment of Kashin-Beck disease, Cao Yixiu's experience in catching rats, and mass dust prevention comprehensive measures. The latest technologies and cutting-edge sciences, such as direct vision heart surgery, thoracic great vessel surgery, successful clinical application of domestic artificial heart-lung machines, and research on antibiotics, biological products, and chemical drugs, have all made great progress.

    坚持政治挂帅　密切结合生产　大搞群众运动
    全国卫生工作呈现新面貌
    建立了一个为人民公社服务的农村卫生医疗保健网
    本报讯　1959年我国的卫生事业在党的总路线光辉照耀下和八届八中全会反右倾、鼓干劲的精神鼓舞下，坚持政治挂帅，为生产服务，密切结合生产，大搞群众运动，在1958年大跃进的基础上，又获得了伟大的成就。
    一年来，以除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病为中心的群众卫生运动更加广泛深入的开展。在城市、农村，在工厂、公社……广大群众根据病害发生发展的规律，紧紧结合几年来所取得的经验，自春季开始，卫生运动一浪高过一浪，既轰轰烈烈，又踏踏实实，先进单位和地区由点到面的越来越多。并出现了如山西稷山、河南登封、安徽界首、山东日照等大片地区基本消灭病害，卫生面貌焕然一新的先进地区。
    由于卫生情况的改善和群众性卫生预防工作的开展，使许多流行病和季节性传染病的发病率大大降低，安徽省界首县出现了二百三十一个没有传染病的村庄，山西稷山县太阳村几年来没有流行过传染病。各厂矿由于注意了防尘防暑防毒，加强了防治职业中毒和厂矿多发病的工作，也大大降低了发病率。所有这些成绩的取得，都大大提高了出勤率，直接支援了生产，河北省岳城水库工地，是一个有二十万民工的大工地，自开工以来即坚持开展卫生运动，没有发生传染病的流行，民工发病率由开工初期的1．3％降到0．8％，出勤率由95％上升到98％。而对几种危害人民最严重的寄生虫病，以及各地的地方病患者的加速治疗，使大量病人恢复健康，重新走向生产岗位，对生产也是一巨大的支援。如1959年共治疗血吸虫病人九十多万人，连以前几年治疗的总数就达四百九十万人，其中就有三百五十万人已经治愈。在送走瘟神的疫区，出现了一片欣欣向荣的气象。
    一年来，在卫生组织建设上由于贯彻了城乡兼顾、大中小结合、国家举办与公社举办结合、中西医结合、普及与提高结合等“两条腿走路”的方针，紧密结合生产建设，特别是随着人民公社的巩固和健全发展，卫生医疗保健组织也有了更大的发展，目前全国正规病床已达到五十七万余张，比1958年增长约30％，并继续举办了大量的简易病床和家庭病床。由于人民公社的日益巩固和健全发展，也有力地推动了卫生事业的发展。一个为公社服务、为公社所有的、以公社为中心的农村卫生医疗保健网，已初步建立并日益健全。目前社办医院、诊疗所达二十万所以上，公社有卫生院（医院）、产院，许多生产队有卫生所或保健站，生产小队有不脱产或半脱产人员所组成的卫生室（保健室），除专职卫生人员外，还培训了大量的不脱产的卫生员、助产员、保育员、炊事员、饲养员等群众卫生骨干和积极分子。由于医务人员深入田间、工地和食堂、托儿所、敬老院等集体生产生活场所，积极开展医疗预防工作和进行卫生技术指导，大大改善了农村医疗卫生条件，加强了集体生产生活中的卫生保健工作。
    在培养干部方面，目前全国高等医药院校的在校学生已达九万余人；比1958年增加20％以上。中级卫生学校的在校学生达十五万余人；此外，并通过大量发展业余中级和初级卫生学校以及以中西医带徒弟等方式为公社培养了大量中级和初级卫生人员。这种统一性与多样性相结合、普及与提高相结合、全面规划与地方分权相结合的办法，不仅调动了多方面的办学积极因素，扩展了医学教育阵地，加速了卫生队伍的成长，而且使培养干部能够紧密结合生产，适应人民公社化的迫切需要，更好的为除害灭病保障生产建设和人民健康服务。
    随着卫生事业的蓬勃发展，1959年医学科学研究工作也在日新月异的发展着。专业研究机构比1958年增加86．3％，从事研究工作的专业人员也有显著增加，由于认真贯彻了党的科学研究为生产服务、理论联系实际的方针、采取“两条腿走路”和大搞群众运动，使医学科学研究工作的成绩，无论从数量上或质量上都远远超过以往任何一年，如上海市1959年共完成的科学研究项目三千多个，比原计划增加两倍，比大跃进的1958年研究成果还多一倍以上。1959年医学科学工作的伟大成就表现在：一、广泛的开展了规模浩大的群众性科学活动，如在全国范围内完成了药用植物、人民公社营养调查，并进行了矽肺、高血压病和肿瘤等病的大量的普查工作，对进一步防治疾病提供了科学依据和重要资料；二、中西医更加亲密合作，积极的对祖国医学进行了临床与理论的研究，总结了许多疾病的治疗规律，提高了医疗效果，如用中西医综合疗法对控制高血压有了新的创见，对经络的本质和针灸作用机制的研究也有了良好的开端；三、结合现代医学理论总结了大量的防治经验和土方土法，使实践上升到理论。现已总结和掌握了一套消灭五大寄生虫病的科学技术，如血吸虫病的三日疗法不但为治愈三百多万病人的实践充分证明疗效良好，而且创立了新的理论观点。对土法除害灭病经验，如大骨节病的治疗、曹依秀的捕鼠经验以及群众性防尘综合措施等也都作了重点研究。最新技术和尖端科学方面如心脏直视手术、胸腔大血管手术、国产人工心肺机在临床方面成功的应用和抗菌素、生物制品、化学药物等方面的研究都有很大的发展。　（卫生部办公厅）
