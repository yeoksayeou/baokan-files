    Improve Management and Promote Technological Innovation
    Chongqing Radio Factory's Departments Clear the Way for the Innovation Movement in Terms of Technology, Materials, and Regulations

    (Our Dispatch) The technical personnel and management personnel of Chongqing Radio Factory are actively creating conditions for the broad masses of workers to engage in technological innovation and technological revolution, effectively promoting the vigorous development of this mass movement.

    In order to adapt to the increasingly vigorous demands of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, the factory recently specially transferred a group of cadres to establish a technology promotion section, focusing on the realization and promotion of major innovation projects. Not long ago, Yang Zejun, a representative attending the National Congress of Heroes, proposed the installation of automatic program control on lathes, but he was a fitter and did not understand electrical principles. The technology promotion section immediately sent technical staff familiar with electricity to help him solve electrical and many other key problems, so that this proposal was quickly realized. Then, they helped him summarize experience and promote it throughout the factory, which played a significant role in solving the key problem of the factory's insufficient lathes.

    All departments tried every means to meet the needs of technological innovation and technological revolution for equipment, tools, and materials. Many major innovation proposals put forward by workers require the manufacture of mechanical and electrical equipment, but this cannot be solved within the workshop. The production planning section promptly included the manufacture of this equipment in the production plan and assigned it to the three machining workshops for processing and manufacturing; at the same time, when arranging the machining plan for each period, they left 20% to 30% of leeway and organized the various machining workshops to establish three-ization (mechanization, automation, and linkage) groups, to manufacture various equipment for the major proposals temporarily put forward by the workers. The automatic screw production line and other innovation projects recently installed in the factory were mostly mechanically processed and manufactured by the production planning department. The staff of the supply section and the tool section often went down to the workshops to "stand guard and watch," actively understanding the needs of materials and tools, and organizing supply in a timely manner.

    After a large number of innovation proposals were realized, the production appearance of the workshop changed rapidly. Many old rules and regulations have fallen behind the situation. The factory's department worked with the workers to revise various rules and regulations in a timely manner to adapt to the development of production. From October of last year to the end of January this year, while innovating and revising, the entire factory has revised 228 kinds of technological processes. In the process of revision, the technical cadres of the departments, together with the workshop cadres and workers, first conducted a survey of manpower, equipment conditions, and processing objects, and collected a large amount of new technology information from home and abroad, and then, combined with the factory's situation, lined up machine tools and parts, and put forward a large number of opinions on improving product design and processing methods, greatly simplifying product structure and shortening processing man-hours, making the new technological processes a driving force for promoting the development of the technological innovation movement and production leaps.

    While revising the technological processes, the entire factory also launched the work of revising labor quotas. Starting from December of last year, the labor quota management department, in view of the fact that the old quotas could not adapt to the new situation and that thousands of laborers were still lacking to complete this year's plan, together with other staff, conducted four checks (checking labor organization, technological operation, quota level, and technical organizational measures) and four determinations (determining machine tools, operation, man-hours, and personnel), and started to revise the labor quotas. Up to now, various quotas of the entire factory have been investigated, and new quotas have been set, so that the man-hour quotas of various products in the entire factory have generally decreased by 25% compared with December of last year, and some products have also been reduced by more than 70%. Due to the realization of multi-cavity molding in the bakelite section, the quota has been changed from one piece every three minutes in the past to six pieces every four minutes, solving the problem of tight bakelite supply.

    The department staff of this factory also frequently went into the workshops to investigate and study key production problems, and constantly put forward the main attack direction of the technological innovation movement to the workers, so that the innovation spearhead often targeted key production problems.

    These works of the department staff have prompted the technological innovation and technological revolution movement of the whole factory to develop more vigorously and healthily, and the innovation proposals have been realized more and faster. In the first month of this year, the factory staff put forward more than 6,000 proposals, and more than 5,000 have been realized, resulting in two automatic production lines and fourteen automated lathes. Because the department work promotes the technological innovation movement well, since the fourth quarter of last year, the factory's output and quality have been rising month by month, and in January of this year, the monthly plan was overfulfilled by 25%.

    搞好管理　促进技术革新
    重庆无线电厂各科室从技术、物资、规章方面为革新运动开路
    本报讯　重庆无线电厂各科室技术人员和管理人员，积极为职工群众大搞技术革新和技术革命创造条件，有效地促进了这个群众运动的蓬勃发展。
    为了适应技术革新和技术革命运动越来越蓬勃发展的要求，最近这个厂专门抽调一批干部成立了技术推广科，集中抓重大革新项目的实现和推广。不久前，出席全国群英会的代表杨泽君提出了在车床上安装自动程序控制的建议，但他是一个钳工，不懂电气原理。技术推广科立即派熟悉电气的技术员工帮助他解决了电气和很多其他关键问题，使这项建议很快就实现了。接着，又帮助他总结经验，在全厂普遍推广，对解决全厂车床不足的关键问题起了很大作用。
    各科室都千方百计想法满足技术革新和技术革命对设备、工具和材料等的需要。很多工人提出的重大革新建议都要制造机械设备和电气设备，但本车间无法解决。生产计划科就及时将这些设备的制造纳入生产计划，分配给三个机械加工车间加工制造；同时，在安排每个时期的机械加工计划时，都留有20％——30％的余地，并组织各机械加工车间专门成立了三化（机械化、自动化、联动化）小组，为职工们临时提出的重大建议制造各种设备。最近厂内安装的螺钉生产自动线等革新项目，大部分机械是生产计划部门组织本厂加工制造的。供应科和工具科的工作人员，经常下车间“站岗放哨”，主动了解材料、工具的需要情况，及时组织供应。
    革新建议大量实现后，车间生产面貌日新月异。很多旧的规程制度已落在形势后面。这个厂的科室部门与工人群众一起及时修订了各种规章制度，适应生产的发展。从去年10月份到今年1月底，在边革新、边修订的情况下，全厂已修订了二百二十八种工艺规程。在修订过程中，科室技术干部和车间干部、工人一起，事先对人力和设备条件，加工对象进行摸底，又大量收集国内外新技术情报，再结合本厂情况将机床和零件进行排队，提出了大量改进产品设计、加工方法的意见，大大简化了产品结构和缩短加工工时，使新的工艺规程成为促进技术革新运动发展和生产跃进的动力。
    在修订工艺规程的同时，全厂还开展了修订劳动定额的工作。劳动定额管理部门从去年12月开始，针对旧定额不能适应新形势，而完成今年计划却还缺少数千劳动力的情况，和其他工作人员一起，以四查（查劳动组织、工艺操作、定额水平和技术组织措施）四定（定机床、操作、工时和人员），着手进行修订劳动定额的工作。到目前为止，已对全厂的各种定额进行了调查，并订出了新的定额，使全厂各类产品的工时定额普遍比去年12月下降了25％，有些产品还降低了70％以上。胶木工段由于实现了一模多压，定额由过去每三分钟一件改为四分钟六件，解决了胶木供应紧张的问题。
    这个厂的科室工作人员还经常深入车间调查研究生产关键问题，不断向工人群众提出技术革新运动的主攻方向，使革新矛头经常针对生产关键问题。
    科室工作人员的这些工作促使全厂的技术革新和技术革命运动更加蓬勃和健康的发展，革新建议实现得又多又快。在今年的头一个月里，全厂职工提出六千多件建议，就实现了五千多件，搞成两条生产自动线和十四台车机自动化。由于科室工作促进技术革新运动开展得好，这个厂从去年四季度以来，产量、质量都月月上升，今年1月份超额25％完成了月计划。
