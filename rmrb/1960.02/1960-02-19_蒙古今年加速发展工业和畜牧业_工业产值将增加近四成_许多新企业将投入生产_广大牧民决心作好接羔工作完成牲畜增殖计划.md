    Reported by this newspaper: Mongolia's industrial production will achieve further development this year. The output value of industrial products will reach 590.4 million tugriks (Mongolian currency), an increase of 38.4% compared to last year. The product production of enterprises affiliated with the Mongolian Ministry of Industry will increase by 46.6%. From this year's industrial production plan, it can be seen that the production of coal, electricity, building materials, daily necessities, and food industry products will increase significantly. The state-owned flour mill, which recently went into production, will produce more than 30,000 tons of flour for residents this year.
    This year, Mongolia's textile industry will also produce 210,000 meters of woolen fabrics.
    Due to the expansion of light industry and food industry production, the production of leather shoes will increase by 50%, felt boots will increase by 83%, and the production of meat, cream, laundry soap, and toilet soap will also increase significantly. Handicraft cooperatives make full use of local resources and play an important role in expanding the production of daily necessities. The production of handicraft cooperatives will increase by 5.4% this year, including a 24% increase in dresses and clothing. The production of timber enterprises will increase by 8.8%.
    Mongolia will expand the production of leather and shoe factories this year, which are being renovated and expanded with the help of Czechoslovakia.
    This year, some large-scale enterprises in Mongolia, such as large printing factories, Ulaanbaatar's No. 4 Thermal Power Plant, large enterprises in the Middle Gobi Province and Sukhbaatar Province, and some small enterprises in Kharkhorin, will be put into production one after another.
    The broad masses of workers and staff members of Mongolia's state-owned industrial enterprises and handicraft cooperatives are mobilizing all forces to strive to overfulfill the production plan for the final year of the Three-Year Plan – 1960 ahead of schedule.
    Ulaanbaatar, February 17th (By Our Own Correspondent) – Mongolia's lambing work has already begun throughout the country. The broad masses of herdsmen in pastoral areas who have realized agricultural and livestock cooperation are working hard to ensure the survival of all lambs and to ensure the safe overwintering of livestock.
    Laboring herdsmen in Bayan-Ölgii Province, who completed the livestock breeding task of the Three-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule with a surplus of 4%, have summarized last year's livestock breeding experience and made full preparations for lambing, ensuring the safe survival of the first batch of lambs in 1960. The lambs born in agricultural and livestock cooperatives such as "Motherland" and "Sukhbaatar" in the Front Hangai Province have also all survived.
    Bayankhongor Province has put forward the task of increasing livestock by 47,600 heads this year. By the end of January, more than 80,000 lambs had been born throughout the province, with a survival rate of 99%. Their livestock breeding measures are to make preparations for lambing and lamb protection. A total of 1,600 lamb sheds have been built throughout the province, 7,180 lamb blankets have been added, and 136 tons of feed have been stored. This has created favorable conditions for improving the survival rate of lambs.
    Doing a good job in lambing and lamb protection is one of the important links in completing the livestock production plan. The editorial published by Mongolia's "Unen" on February 9th required leaders at all levels to specifically organize this work and called on herdsmen across the country to actively strive to overfulfill the task of livestock breeding in the Three-Year Plan.

    蒙古今年加速发展工业和畜牧业
    工业产值将增加近四成  许多新企业将投入生产  广大牧民决心作好接羔工作完成牲畜增殖计划
    本报讯　蒙古今年工业生产将获得进一步发展。工业品产值将达五亿九千零四十万图格里克（蒙币），将比去年增长38．4％。蒙古工业部所属企业的产品生产将增长46．6％。从今年工业生产计划中可以看到，煤炭、电力、建筑材料、日用品以及食品工业的产品生产将有显著增加。不久前投入生产的国营面粉厂，今年将为居民生产三万多吨面粉。
    今年蒙古的纺织工业也将生产出二十一万米毛织品。
    由于轻工业和食品工业生产扩大，皮鞋的生产将增长50％，毡鞋将增长83％，肉类、奶油、洗衣肥皂和香皂生产也将显著增加。工艺合作社充分利用当地的资源，对扩大日用品生产具有重要的作用。工艺合作社的生产今年将增长5．4％，其中连衣裙和衣服将增长24％。木材企业的生产将增长8．8％。
    蒙古今年将扩大皮革和皮鞋工厂的生产，这些工厂是在捷克斯洛伐克的帮助下改建和扩建的。
    蒙古今年将有一些大型企业，如大型印刷厂、乌兰巴托第四热电厂、中戈壁省和苏赫巴托尔等省的大型企业以及哈拉和林的一些小型企业先后将投入生产。
    蒙古国营工业企业和工艺合作社的广大职工正动员一切力量，为提前完成三年计划最后一年——1960年的生产计划而努力。
    本报乌兰巴托17日电　蒙古今年的接羔工作已经在全国各地普遍开始。实现了农牧业合作化的牧区广大牧民，正在努力使羔畜全部成活和保证牲畜安全过冬。
    提前一年超额4％完成了三年计划牲畜增殖任务的巴音乌列盖省劳动牧民，总结去年增畜经验，充分作好接羔准备工作，使1960年的第一批羔畜安全成活了。前杭爱省“祖国”、“苏赫巴托尔”等农牧业合作社接下的羔畜也全部成活。
    白音洪古尔省提出了今年增畜四万七千六百头的任务，到1月底为止，全省已接羔八万多头，成活率达到99％。他们的增畜措施是，作好接羔、保羔准备，全省范围内共搭盖一千六百个羔棚，添制羔被七千一百八十条，贮备饲草一百三十六吨。这样就为提高羔畜成活率创造了良好条件。
    作好接羔保羔工作是完成牲畜增产计划的重要环节之一。蒙古“真理报”2月9日发表的社论，要求各级领导具体组织这项工作，号召全国牧民积极努力争取超额完成三年计划的牲畜增殖任务。
