　　Ulterior Motives
　　Former U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson recently, at a press conference held in Mexico City, asked Latin American countries to take the lead in making efforts to achieve disarmament, in order to set an example for the world to "restore reason." He also said that in this way, "Latin American countries can use resources for economic development, thereby leading the world out of a nightmare."
　　No matter who it is, advising people to do good is always a good thing. Stevenson, considering the interests of the economic development of Latin American countries, advised them to reduce the burden of military spending, which was originally not objectionable. However, this lobbyist comes from the United States, which wants to "maintain the military budget at its usual highest level," which inevitably makes people feel that it has ulterior motives. Every Latin American would ask Mr. Stevenson this question: Why doesn't the United States, which has always regarded itself as the "leader" of the American continent (and not just the American continent), take the lead in this regard? Doesn't President Eisenhower also admit that huge military expenditures have caused a serious financial crisis in the United States? Moreover, if the United States sets an example in "restoring reason," it will obviously have a greater impact on achieving universal world disarmament than all Latin American countries combined.
　　Especially when U.S. warships and armed forces are currently flexing their muscles in the Caribbean region, seriously threatening the independence of countries such as Cuba, and the United States is constantly strengthening the military forces of those puppet regimes in Dominica with military aid to suppress the people, what is Stevenson's intention in benevolently advising Latin American countries to disarm? Shouldn't Latin American countries first demand the abolition of military agreements signed with the United States, cancel U.S. military bases, and demand that the United States immediately stop its interference and provocations against Cuba before they really accept Stevenson's advice and decide to reduce armaments?

    别有用心
    美国民主党前总统候选人史蒂文森最近在墨西哥城举行的一次记者招待会上，要求拉丁美洲各国在实现裁军方面带头作出努力，以便为全世界“恢复理智”立下榜样。他还说，这样“拉丁美洲各国可以把资源用在经济发展上，从而引导世界摆脱梦魇”。
    不管什么人，劝人为善应该说总是好事情。史蒂文森从拉丁美洲各国的经济发展的利益考虑，劝告它们减轻军费的负担，本来是无可非议的。但是这位说客竟是来自要把军事预算“维持在平时的最高水平”的美国，那就未免会使人感到是别有用心了。每一个拉丁美洲的人民都会向史蒂文森先生提出这样的疑问：一向以美洲大陆（而且还不仅美洲大陆）的“领导者”自居的美国，为什么却不在这方面起个带头作用呢？艾森豪威尔总统不是也承认庞大的军事开支造成了美国严重的财政危机吗？况且美国要是在“恢复理智”方面立下榜样，显然要比所有拉丁美洲国家做起来对实现世界普遍裁军所发生的影响要大得多。
    特别是当目前美国的军舰和武装部队正在加勒比海地区耀武扬威，严重威胁着古巴等国独立的时候，美国正在不断以军事援助来加强多米尼加那些傀儡政权用来镇压人民的军事力量的时候，史蒂文森却大慈大悲地劝拉丁美洲国家裁军，居心何在呢？难道拉丁美洲国家在真的接受史蒂文森的劝告，决定裁减军备之前，它们不应该首先要求废除同美国签订的军事协定，取消美国的军事基地，并要求美国立即停止对古巴的干涉和挑衅吗？
