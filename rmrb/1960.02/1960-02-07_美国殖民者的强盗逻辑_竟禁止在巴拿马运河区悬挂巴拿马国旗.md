    American Colonialists' Thuggish Logic
    Actually Prohibit the Hanging of the Panamanian Flag in the Panama Canal Zone
    Xinhua News Agency, Panama City, February 5th: A spokesman for the Panamanian Foreign Ministry announced that the resolution passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on February 2nd, which prohibits the hanging of the Panamanian flag in the Panama Canal Zone, is illegal, harmful, discriminatory, and hateful.
    The Panamanian Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the aforementioned decision of the U.S. House of Representatives is the most effective tool for weakening the treaty between Panama and the United States. He requested that the United States take the necessary measures to avoid actions that are extremely detrimental to normal relations between the two countries.
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 5th: The U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution on February 2nd, unreasonably rejecting Panama's legitimate demand to hang the Panamanian flag in the Panama Canal Zone. According to the "New York Times," the U.S. Senate will apparently take the same stance as the House of Representatives.
    People from all walks of life in Panama demand that the national flag be flown in the Canal Zone to show Panama's sovereignty over the Canal Zone. After Panama twice erupted in fierce anti-American demonstrations demanding the maintenance of sovereignty over the canal in November last year, the U.S. State Department vaguely stated that it would consider the issue of flying the Panamanian flag in the Canal Zone, attempting to quell the anti-American wave.
    A commentator from the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain said that the flag-flying issue is a major issue in Panama's presidential election campaign this year. If the United States does not quickly make a decision that satisfies the Panamanian people, "it will encounter greater difficulties; compared with the turmoil in November last year, last year's events will be nothing more than child's play."

    美国殖民者的强盗逻辑
    竟禁止在巴拿马运河区悬挂巴拿马国旗
    新华社5日讯　巴拿马城消息：巴拿马外交部发言人宣布，美国众议院2日通过的一项关于禁止在巴拿马运河区悬挂巴拿马国旗的决议是非法的、有害的、歧视性的和令人憎恨的。
    这位巴拿马外交部发言人说，美国众议院的上述决定是削弱巴拿马和美国的条约的最有效的工具。他要求美国采取必要的措施来避免实现对两国的正常关系极为有害的行动。
    新华社5日讯　华盛顿消息：美国众议院2日通过决议，无理拒绝了巴拿马提出的在巴拿马运河区悬挂巴拿马国旗的合法要求。据“纽约时报”报道，美国参议院显然也将采取和众议院相同的立场。
    巴拿马各阶层人民要求实现在运河区悬挂国旗以显示巴拿马在运河区的主权。去年11月间巴拿马两次爆发要求维护运河主权的激烈的反美示威以后，美国国务院曾经含糊地表示将考虑在运河区悬挂巴拿马国旗问题，企图借此平息反美浪潮。
    美国斯克利浦斯—霍华德报系的评论员说，悬挂国旗问题是巴拿马今年总统竞选运动中的一个主要问题。美国如果不迅速作出使巴拿马人民满意的决定，“它就要遭到更大的困难，如果拿去年11月间的那场动乱相比，去年的事件将不过是一场儿戏而已”。
