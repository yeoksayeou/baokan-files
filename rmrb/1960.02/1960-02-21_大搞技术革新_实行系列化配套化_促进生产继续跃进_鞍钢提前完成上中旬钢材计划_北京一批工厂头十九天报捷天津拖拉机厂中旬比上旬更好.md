Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 20th: The workers of the thirteen rolling mills of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, aiming at the characteristics of continuous production, vigorously carried out serialization and standardization of technological innovations, promoting a further leap forward in production. As of 9:00 AM on the 20th, calculated by the rolling output of each factory, they completed the steel production plan for the first and middle ten days of February fifteen hours ahead of schedule. The steel quality acceptance rate exceeded the plan by 0.96%, and safe production was achieved.

Entering February, the Party committees of the rolling mills of Anshan Iron and Steel Company criticized the "looking outward, greedy for big and foreign" mentality among some cadres, which hindered the rapid development of technological innovation. They called on workers to use the method of "self-reliance, adopting foreign methods when possible, adopting local methods when possible, combining foreign and local methods, and gradually improving" to realize technological innovation proposals. Workers in various rolling mills actively implemented innovation proposals themselves. According to incomplete statistics, the number of technological innovation projects implemented from February 1st to 16th exceeded those in January by more than 3,000. As a result, new contradictions emerged in many rolling mills, namely, after the key of one process was broken through, the production of other processes appeared to be incompatible. In response to this situation, the Party committees of the First Primary Rolling Mill, the First Medium Plate Mill, and many other rolling mills adopted a combination of mobilizing the masses and organizing professional shock teams, launching a surge of serializing and standardizing technological innovations, carrying out a series of innovations from steelmaking, rolling, heavy shearing, to external transport, and coordinating innovation projects to make various processes adapt to each other, promoting a further leap forward in production. After implementing the major innovation of "rolling double ingots," the First Primary Rolling Mill increased the production capacity of the rolling mill by more than 10%. However, a series of processes such as steelmaking, ingot transport, heavy shearing, and loading remained at the original production level. The factory Party committee mobilized workers to vigorously carry out serialized and standardized technological innovations, realizing 7,622 innovation proposals in the first half of February, breaking through most of the weak links. For example, workers formed mixed teams of multiple trades, designing and constructing themselves to expand the heating furnace chamber, increasing steelmaking capacity by 25%. Veteran workers, technicians, and cadres combined to change single-bucket ingot transport trolleys to double-bucket ingot transport trolleys, improving ingot transport efficiency, thereby making each production process adapt to each other. After the First Medium Plate Mill implemented two major innovation proposals in January: double-layer steelmaking and increased rolling speed, the shearing capacity of the heavy shears could not keep up, and the rolled steel plates could not be cut in time. In February, under the leadership of the Party committee, the factory workers designed and constructed the mechanization of the heavy shears themselves, promoting the improvement of the entire production.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th: Beijing Electronic Tube Factory, North China Radio Equipment Factory, Beijing Second Cotton Textile Factory, Beijing Woolen Mill, Guanghua Timber Factory, and other factories have comprehensively overfulfilled their production plans from February 1st to 19th. Currently, workers are continuing to exert their efforts, seizing the production in the last ten days of the month, and striving to complete and overfulfill the February plan ahead of schedule.

Since the Spring Festival, these factories have further and systematically carried out technological innovation and technical revolution movements, promoting a continuous leap forward in production. From February 1st to 19th, the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory has completed 91.2% and 77.3% of its February output value and production plans, respectively, an increase of 7.8% and 10.9% over the same period in January. The quality and variety plans have also been completed well. The North China Radio Equipment Factory completed 92.1% of its February output value plan in nineteen days, with an average daily output value increase of 5.36% over January. The output, quality, and variety plans for the nineteen days have all been overfulfilled. While completing the nineteen-day output value, output, and quality plans, the Beijing Second Cotton Textile Factory and the Beijing Woolen Mill have respectively successfully trial-produced more than ten new products such as corduroy, high-grade poplin, and striped tweed.

Now, the workers are making persistent efforts, full of confidence to complete the February production plan ahead of schedule and welcome the production in March. Female workers at the Beijing Second Cotton Textile Factory are carrying out a labor competition of "three highs and one good," namely, high output, high quality, high attendance rate, and good political command, to welcome the "March 8th" International Working Women's Day. The female workers of Class B in the doubler-twisting workshop have launched a "mother-counterpart competition," and the output of each class producing 36 strands of yarn has increased from 78 kilograms to more than 81 kilograms. While seizing the production in the last ten days of February, the workers of the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory have begun to discuss the March plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 20th: The leadership of the Tianjin Tractor Factory is grasping both the current production and the preparation work for the next stage of production, promoting a continuous leap forward in production.

In the first half of February, the production level of this factory increased by 15.8% compared with the same period in January. The production situation has been even better since mid-February, with the average daily output value increasing by half compared with the first ten days of the month. There have been no quality accidents in the entire factory.

The leadership method of the tractor factory, which firmly grasps the preparation work for production while tightly managing the current production, has brought great benefits to the February production. In the first five days of February, two tractors were assembled and put into storage, breaking the historical precedent that finished products could not be produced at the beginning of the month. Since many production preparation works are carried out in advance, the entire factory's employees can free their hands in the first ten days of February to concentrate their efforts on breaking through the key of production. For example, the two types of filters, diesel and oil, on the tractors could not be supplied by the cooperating factories in time, so the employees themselves rushed to design and manufacture them. In the manufacturing process, the factory established a special production scheduling meeting. The factory directors listened to reports every day, and when problems arose, they mobilized employees to quickly solve them. So far, not only have the filters needed for this month been produced, but also fifty semi-finished products have been prepared for next month.

While ensuring that the February production exceeds January, the factory leadership mobilized all employees in mid-February to make comprehensive preparations for the next month's production. Employees analyzed the work-in-process products, coordinated parts, raw materials and materials required for the next month one by one, and adopted different countermeasures according to the shortage situation and the next month's production progress to solve the problem. For example, since relevant cooperative factories will find it difficult to supply the "final driven ring gear" in March, the employees decided to manufacture a part of it themselves. The factory does not have a ten-ton die forging hammer for forging this part, so the employees of the forging workshop brainstormed and made great efforts in technological innovation, using a one-ton clamp hammer for forging. They found that some cooperative factories had difficulties in manufacturing molds, so they manufactured molds for them, helping these factories to complete their cooperative tasks in time. If the production hours for the next month are not enough, the factory will mobilize all office cadres to cooperate with the workers to find various ways to compress working hour quotas and tap production potential. After preliminary discussion, the employees in the chassis workshop will be able to compress working hour quotas by 10% to 20%. Currently, 70% of the parts needed for tractor production in March have been prepared. Employees are rushing to manufacture key parts with small reserves and urgently needed at the beginning of next month. The factory's production plan for March has been shown to the masses on the 19th, and the employees, with the determination to "make March production even higher than February," are enthusiastically starting to discuss this plan.

    大搞技术革新　实行系列化配套化　促进生产继续跃进
    鞍钢提前完成上中旬钢材计划
    北京一批工厂头十九天报捷天津拖拉机厂中旬比上旬更好
    新华社鞍钢20日电　鞍山钢铁公司十三个轧钢厂的职工，针对连续生产的特点，大搞技术革新系列化和配套化，促进了生产进一步跃进。截至20日上午九时为止，按各厂轧出量计算，提前十五个小时完成了上旬和中旬的钢材生产计划，钢材合格率比计划超过0．96％，并且作到了安全生产。
    进入2月，鞍钢各轧钢厂党委批判了部分干部中存在的影响技术革新迅速发展的“眼睛向外，贪大求洋”思想，号召职工用“自力更生，能洋则洋，能土则土，洋土结合，逐步提高”的办法，实现技术革新建议。各轧钢厂工人积极地自己动手实现革新建议，据不完全统计，从2月1日到16日实现的技术革新项目比1月份还多三千多件。这样一来，许多轧钢厂又出现了新的矛盾，即一个工序的关键被突破后，其他工序的生产出现了不相适应的现象。针对这一情况，第一初轧厂、第一中板厂等许多轧钢厂的党委，采用发动群众和组织专业突击队相结合的办法，掀起了技术革新系列化、配套化的热潮，从烧钢、轧钢、大剪、外运等环节进行一系列革新，并将革新项目配合成套，使各工序互相适应，促使生产进一步跃进。第一初轧厂实行“轧双锭”的重大革新以后，使轧钢机生产能力猛增10％以上，但是烧钢、运锭、大剪、装车等一系列工序，仍停留在原有的生产水平上。工厂党委发动职工大搞技术革新系列化配套化，在2月上半月实现了七千六百二十二件革新建议，突破了绝大部分薄弱环节。如工人组成了多工种混合队，自己设计施工，扩大了均热炉膛，提高了烧钢能力25％；老工人、技术人员和干部三结合，将单斗运钢锭台车改为双斗运钢锭台车，提高了运锭效率；从而使各个生产工序相互适应。第一中板厂在1月份实现双层烧钢、轧钢轧辊压下速度加快两项重大革新建议之后，大剪子的剪断能力赶不上，轧出来的钢板不能及时剪断；工厂职工2月份便在党委领导下，自己动手设计施工，实现了大剪子机械化，促进了整个生产的提高。
    新华社20日讯　北京电子管厂、华北无线电器材厂、北京第二棉纺织厂、北京毛纺厂、光华木材厂等工厂，全面超额完成了2月1日到19日的生产计划。目前工人们正继续鼓足干劲，抓紧下旬的生产，力争2月份计划提前超额完成。
    从春节以来，这些工厂进一步深入系统地开展技术革新和技术革命运动，推动了生产持续跃进。从1日到19日，北京电子管厂2月份的产值和产量计划，已分别完成91．2％和77．3％，比1月同期分别增长7．8％和10．9％，质量、品种计划也完成得很好。华北无线电器材厂十九天完成2月份产值计划的92．1％，平均日产值比1月份增长5．36％，十九天的产量、质量和品种计划都超额完成。北京第二棉纺织厂、北京毛纺厂在完成十九天产值、产量、质量计划的同时，分别试制成功了灯芯绒、高级府绸、条花呢等十多种新产品。
    现在，工人们正再接再厉，满怀信心地为提前完成2月份生产计划、迎接3月份生产而努力。北京第二棉纺织厂女工，正在开展产量高、质量高、出勤率高、政治挂帅好的“三高一好”的劳动竞赛，迎接“三八”国际劳动妇女节。筒拈车间乙班女工开展了“妈妈对口赛”，每个班生产三十六支纱的产量已由七十八公斤提高到八十一公斤多。北京电子管厂工人们在抓紧2月份下旬生产的同时，已开始讨论3月份计划。
    新华社天津20日电　天津拖拉机制造厂的领导上一手抓当前生产，一手抓下一步生产的准备工作，促进生产持续跃进。
    2月上半月，这个工厂的生产水平比1月同期增长了15．8％；中旬以来生产情况更好，平均日产值比上旬增长了一半；全厂没有发生一次质量事故。
    拖拉机厂狠抓当前生产的同时抓紧生产准备工作的领导方法，给2月份的生产带来了很大的好处。2月头五天，就有两台拖拉机装成入库，打破了历史上月初不能出成品的惯例。由于许多生产准备工作提前进行，全厂职工在2月上旬就能腾出手来集中力量突破生产关键。如拖拉机上的柴油和机油两种滤清器，协作的工厂不能及时供应，职工们就自己突击设计制造。在制造中，工厂建立了专门的生产调度会议，厂长们每天听取汇报，一有问题就发动职工迅速解决，到目前止不仅生产出本月需要的滤清器，而且为下月准备了五十台半成品。
    工厂领导在保证2月生产超1月的同时，在2月中旬就发动全体职工对下月生产进行全面的准备。职工们把下月需要的在制品、协作件和原料材料等一一进行分析，根据欠缺的情况和下月的生产进度，采取不同的对策解决。例如有关协作厂在3月份很难供应“最终从动齿圈”，职工们就决定自己制造一部分。工厂没有锻造这种零件用的十吨模锻锤，锻工车间的职工就群策群力，大闹技术革新，利用一吨夹板锤进行锻打。他们发现有些协作工厂在制造模具等方面有困难，就代他们制造模具，帮助这些工厂能及时完成协作任务。下月的生产工时不够，工厂就发动全体科室干部配合工人想各种办法压缩工时定额，挖掘生产潜力。底盘车间的职工经过初步讨论，工时定额将能压缩10％到20％。3月份拖拉机生产需要的零件目前已有70％备齐；职工们正在突击制造储备量少和下月初就急需的关键性零件。全厂3月份的生产计划已在19日和群众见面，职工们怀着“定叫3月生产更比2月高”的决心，热烈地开始讨论这个计划。（附图片）
