Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch: People's communes in new and old silkworm areas across the country are actively preparing to raise spring silkworms, striving for a bumper harvest of spring cocoons this year. The management of mulberry gardens and the preparation of silkworm rearing rooms and tools are being handled earlier and better than in previous years.

Since communization, concentrated and contiguous silkworm farms have developed rapidly. This year, people's communes in various silkworm areas will further develop the silkworm industry, establish concentrated and contiguous silkworm farms, and first focus on large-scale spring silkworm rearing.

Since last winter, Party committees at all levels in the silkworm areas have led the people's communes in preparing for spring silkworm rearing, promoting mulberry garden management through measures such as holding on-site meetings. As of now, in Zhejiang Province, of the approximately 1.5 million mu of mulberry gardens, over 1.08 million mu have been loosened or fertilized, over 80% of the mulberry gardens have been pruned, many mulberry trees have been whitewashed to prevent insects, and some mulberry gardens have adopted layering measures to increase mulberry leaf production. The province has developed 689,000 mu of new mulberry gardens, and some old mulberry gardens with missing seedlings have also been replanted. The area under mulberry garden cultivation, management, and fertilization exceeds that of any previous year. Similarly, in Sichuan Province, over 80% of the mulberry gardens have been pruned, and some mulberry gardens have been fertilized, layered, and whitewashed. The province has newly planted over 250 million mulberry trees. Jiangsu Province also started mulberry garden fertilization and management early, with the area loosened and fertilized exceeding half that of the same period last year. Many mulberry gardens in northern Jiangsu have also been fertilized this year. The province has newly planted a total of 235,000 mu of mulberry gardens, all large mulberry gardens operated by people's commune teams. For example, the Wuji Commune in Suining County has built a large mulberry garden of 25,000 mu.

Other provinces such as Guangdong, Anhui, Shandong, and Henan have also done a better job of mulberry garden management than in previous years.

Currently, people's communes in various localities are building concentrated and simple silkworm rearing rooms and adding silkworm frames, silkworm trays, and other tools. As of January 25th, Zhejiang Province had renovated over 22,000 old silkworm rearing rooms, built over 25,000 new ones, and added over 400,000 silkworm trays. People's communes in various localities are establishing specialized teams and training technicians for large-scale silkworm rearing. Sichuan, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other provinces have held on-site meetings to carry out technical innovations in silkworm rearing rooms, tools, and silkworm rearing techniques to welcome large-scale spring silkworm rearing.

    加强桑园管理　修建蚕室　添置蚕架
    新老蚕区准备大量饲养春蚕
    据新华社8日讯　全国新老蚕区的人民公社都在积极准备饲养春蚕，力争今年春茧丰收。各地的桑园管理工作和蚕室、蚕具的准备工作，都比往年抓得又早又好。
    公社化以来，集中连片的蚕桑场发展很快。今年，各蚕区人民公社都将进一步地发展蚕桑事业，集中连片地建立蚕桑场，首先大规模地饲养春蚕。
    去冬以来，蚕区各级党委就已领导人民公社作饲养春蚕的准备工作，用召开现场会议等措施促进了桑园的管理。截至目前，浙江全省约一百五十万亩桑园，经过松土或施肥的已达到一百零八万多亩，80％以上的桑园修剪了枝条，很多桑园树干刷白防虫，部分桑园采取伏条措施增产桑叶。全省发展新桑园六十八万九千亩，部分缺株的老桑园也进行了补植。桑园培育管理和施肥的面积超过了以往任何一年。同样，四川省的桑园也有80％以上修剪了枝条，部分桑园进行了施肥、伏条、刷白等工作，全省新栽桑树两亿五千多万株。江苏省桑园的肥培管理也抓得早，松土施肥面积超过去年同期一半左右。苏北地区的很多桑园今年也施了肥。全省新植桑园共有二十三万五千亩，都是人民公社社队经营的大桑园。如睢宁县五集公社就建成了一个二万五千亩的大桑园。
    其他广东、安徽、山东、河南等省，桑园的管理工作都比往年作得好。
    现在，各地人民公社都在大建集中的简易蚕室和添置蚕架、蚕?等用具。截至1月25日统计，浙江省已修好旧蚕室两万二千多间，新建两万五千多间，添置蚕?四十多万具。各地人民公社都在为大规模养蚕建立专业队伍和训练技术人员。四川、浙江、江苏等省都召开了现场会议，开展蚕室、蚕具和养蚕的技术革新运动，迎接大规模的春蚕饲养工作。
