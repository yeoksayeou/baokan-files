    Fresh and Stale
    Lu Jian
    A bicycle sped past on the side of the road, nearly hitting a pedestrian. The cyclist didn't have time to brake, so he simply waved his hand in apology. However, the pedestrian who was almost hit refused to let it go, shouting at the cyclist's back: "What? Did you want to kill me? Do you even know how to ride a bike?..."
    Right then and there, two or three pedestrians nearby tried to dissuade him, saying that the cyclist was naturally at fault, but he didn't mean to hit him, and he had already apologized. But he still refused to let it go and continued to shout. So, one comrade said: "Cursing in the street, that's nothing new!" As soon as this was said, the shouting person stopped.
    This was a small incident that happened on the street, so small that it couldn't even be called a "small ripple in life." However, it still illustrates a "necessity": the things left over from the old society, the things harmful to the new society and the collective, are being eliminated day by day. Cursing in the street was not uncommon in the past; however, even this small matter bearing the mark of the old society is incompatible with our new socialist atmosphere. It's like a grain of sand mixed in a bowl of white rice, and everyone who eats it will spit it out. "Nothing new!" precisely illustrates the changes in people's views and habits, and the resolute contempt for old things (regardless of their size). This change itself is fresh. It exists in large quantities in our lives and appears every moment. Stale old things are rapidly disappearing, and fresh new things are rapidly growing. This is precisely the law of life in our socialist society.

    新鲜的和不新鲜的
    路简
    一辆自行车在路边疾驰而过，差点撞着一个行人，骑车的人来不及煞车，只好挥一挥手表示歉意。可是那位几乎被撞着的行人却不依，望着骑自行车者的背影，高声嚷起来：“怎么？你想撞死我吗？你倒底会不会骑车？……”
    这儿，旁边同时就有两三个行人劝住他，说骑车的人自然有错，可人家也不是存心要撞，而且已经打了招呼。但他还是不依，还是嚷。于是，有一位同志就说了：“骂街，这可不新鲜了！”这句话一说，嚷嚷的那位才没再嚷下去。
    这是偶然发生在街上的一件小事，小到连个“生活中的小浪花”也说不上。但是，它也还是能说明了一个“必然性”：旧社会里所遗留下来的东西，对新社会、对集体有害的东西，正在一天天被消灭。骂街，在过去是不稀罕的事；可是，即使这件带有旧社会的烙印的小事，也同我们的新社会新风气格格不入。就如同一碗白米饭里还夹着一颗沙子，谁吃了都要把它吐掉。“不新鲜了！”正是说明了人们的看法和习惯的变化，对旧的事物（不管它大小）的坚决的鄙弃。这种变化本身却是新鲜的。它在我们的生活里，大量存在，每时每刻都在出现。不新鲜的旧事物在迅速地消灭，新鲜的新事物在迅速地生长。这正是我们社会主义社会的生活规律。
