Great Collaboration Accelerates Innovation

    Shenyang Garment Industry Ends Treadle Sewing Machine Era in Twelve Days
    Dadong District Organizes Technical Renovation Collaboration Stations, Factory Innovation Suggestions Rapidly Implemented

    (Reported by this newspaper) Shenyang City's garment industry workers, displaying the spirit of Communist grand collaboration, worked intensely for twelve days from February 1st to 12th, achieving powered electrification of all 35 garment factories (cooperatives) and over 1,500 sewing machines in the entire industry. In addition, they self-manufactured and modified over 500 small machines.

    Shenyang's garment industry has a long history, but its equipment was rudimentary, and the degree of mechanization was very low. In all 35 garment factories and sewing cooperatives in the city, manual operation accounted for more than 50%. All of the industry's more than 1,500 sewing machines relied on leg power. Other processes, such as cutting, buttoning, buttonholing, and ironing, were all done manually.

    During this year's Spring Festival, the industry's workers proposed the slogan "Achieve Power Electrification in Ten Days of Hard Work." The entire industry was organized, and a technical renovation team was established. Communist grand collaboration was launched between factories, adopting two major measures: one was the unified mobilization of electric motors and related installation materials by the Technical Renovation Committee, and the other was the unified mobilization of the industry's electric motor installation force, with larger factories leading smaller factories in planned installations. The Sanba Sewing Cooperative, a small cooperative with just over seventy people, would have had difficulty achieving sewing machine electrification in two or three days. However, the City Garment Factory No. 2 took the initiative to install electric motors for them, and the Wood Products Factory actively supported them with timber. As a result, the cooperative quickly achieved powered electrification.

    In the process of achieving powered electrification, all factories implemented the principle of self-reliance as the primary means and seeking external assistance as a supplement, overcoming many difficulties and widely promoting the City Shirt Factory's experience of installing electric motors using indigenous methods. According to incomplete statistics, from the 1st to the 5th alone, the adoption of this indigenous method saved 180 tons of pig iron, 150 cubic meters of timber, and a total of 120,000 yuan.

    Now, the history of treadle sewing machines in Shenyang's garment industry has ended, replaced by workers simply pressing a button, and a long row of sewing machines immediately starts spinning rapidly with the current, increasing the speed from the original 600 revolutions per minute to 1,600 revolutions per minute. Processes such as buttonholing and buttoning have also been replaced by machines instead of manual labor. Labor productivity has greatly increased, and the daily output of garment units throughout the city has more than doubled.

    (Reported by this newspaper) In order to accelerate the development of the technical renovation movement, the CPC Shenyang Dadong District Committee organized 102 enterprises in the district into nine technical renovation collaboration stations. In the past half-month, these collaboration stations have played a tremendous role.

    The characteristics of the factories and enterprises in this district are: many industries, complex types of work; few mechanical industries, many light industries; few large factories, many small factories; rudimentary equipment, low degree of mechanization, and manual operation accounting for 53%. In accordance with the call of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee to "Work hard for a quarter to basically achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization," the factories universally launched a mass technical renovation upsurge. However, some factories were constrained by equipment, technology, and materials, and many renovation projects were delayed, causing the technical renovation movement in the district to progress unevenly.

    In response to the above situation, the District Committee decided to establish technical renovation collaboration stations, proposed specific collaboration plans, and launched grand collaboration activities. The collaboration stations rationally ranked the projects to be collaborated on by the factories, according to priority, in stages, batches, and divisions of labor, to carry out collaborative processing. In order to do a good job in off-site grand collaboration, the factories organized mass innovation implementation collaboration teams, amateur processing factories, and youth shock brigades.

    Due to the extensive and in-depth mobilization of the masses, the collaborative tasks undertaken by the factories proceeded very smoothly. Innovation suggestions were rapidly implemented, and the degree of mechanization was rapidly improved. According to the statistics of eleven factories, more than 210 innovative components were manufactured collaboratively in just over ten days. The Mechanical Parts Factory helped the Yufengmao Weaving Factory solve the problem of two tons of iron materials, enabling four looms to be equipped with automatic warp stop motion devices, and another 220 machines are being improved. In the past, one person watched four machines in this factory, but now it has increased to watching eight machines, and defective products have been eliminated.

### 大协作加快革新速度  沈阳服装业十二天结束了缝纫机用脚踏的历史  大东区组织技术改造协作站各厂革新建议迅速实现

    大协作加快革新速度
    沈阳服装业十二天结束了缝纫机用脚踏的历史
    大东区组织技术改造协作站各厂革新建议迅速实现
    本报讯　沈阳市服装行业职工发挥共产主义大协作的精神，从2月1日到12日大干了十二天，全行业三十五个服装厂（社）、一千五百多台缝纫机全部实现了动力电气化。此外，还自制和改制了小机具五百多种。
    沈阳市服装行业历史悠久，但是设备简陋，机械化程度很低。全市三十五家服装厂和缝纫社，手工操作占50％以上。全行业一千五百多台缝纫机，全部靠两只腿蹬，其他工序，如剪裁、钉扣、锁眼、熨衣等等都是手工操作。
    今年春节期间，这个行业的职工提出“大干十天实现动力电气化”的口号，全行业组织起来，成立了技术改造小组，厂与厂之间开展了共产主义大协作，采取了两大措施：一是由技术革新委员会统一调动电动机和有关安装器材，一是统一调动全行业的电机安装力量，以大厂带小厂的办法有计划进行安装。三八缝纫社是个七十多人的小社，要在两三天的时间里实现缝纫机电动化是有困难的，但是，市被服二厂主动给安电动机，木制品厂主动支援木材，结果很快就实现了全社的动力电气化。
    各厂在实现动力电气化的过程中，都贯彻了以自力更生为主、争取外援为辅的方针，克服许多困难，普遍推广了市衬衣厂土法安电机的经验。据不完全统计，仅1日到5日由于采用这个土办法，就节省了一百八十吨生铁、一百五十立米木材，共节省十二万元。
    现在，沈阳市服装行业中缝纫机用脚蹬的历史结束了，代之而起的是工人只要轻轻一按电钮，一长列缝纫机立刻随着电流而飞快的转动起来，速度由原每分钟六百转提高到一千六百转。锁眼、钉扣等工序也都用机器代替了手工。劳动生产率大大提高，全市服装单位的日产量提高一倍以上。
    本报讯　为了加速技术革新运动的发展，中共沈阳市大东区区委把全区一百零二个企业组成了九个技术改造协作站。半个月来，这些协作站发挥了巨大的作用。
    这个区工厂企业的特点是：行业多，工种复杂；机械工业少，轻工业多；大工厂少，小工厂多；设备简陋，机械化程度低，手工操作占53％。各厂根据中共沈阳市委提出的“大干一季度，基本实现机械化和半机械化”的号召，普遍掀起群众性的技术革新高潮。但是，有些工厂因受设备、技术、材料的限制，许多革新项目迟迟实现不了，使全区技术革新运动进展得不平衡。
    针对上述情况，区委确定成立技术改造协作站，提出了具体的协作计划，开展了大协作活动。协作站对各厂要协作的项目，进行合理的排队，按轻重缓急，分期、分批、分工，进行协作加工。各厂为了搞好厂外的大协作，组织了群众性的革新实现协作大队、业余加工厂、青年突击队。
    由于广泛深入地发动群众，各厂担负的协作任务进行得非常顺利。革新建议迅速实现，机械化程度迅速提高。据十一个工厂的统计，仅十多天就协作制成了二百一十多件革新部件。机械配件厂帮助裕丰茂织布厂解决了两吨铁料，使四台织布机安上了自动停经装置，还有二百二十台机器正在改进中。这个厂过去一个人看四台机器，现在，提高到看八台，并且消灭了次品。
