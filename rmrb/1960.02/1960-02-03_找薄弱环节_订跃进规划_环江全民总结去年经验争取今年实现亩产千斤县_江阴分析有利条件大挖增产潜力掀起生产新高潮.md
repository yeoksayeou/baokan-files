　　This newspaper reports: How much potential is there for agricultural production increase this year? How to tap the potential? Huanjiang County, Guangxi, mobilized all the people to sum up last year's experience, find weak links, tap production potential, and formulate a leap forward plan for 1960.

　　In 1960, the county's total grain output is planned to reach 350 million jin, an increase of 40% over 1959, to become a county achieving 1,000 jin per mu; the total output value of cash crops is planned to reach 4.96 million yuan, an increase of 88.3% over 1959; the total industrial output value is planned to reach 16.5 million yuan, an increase of 69.1% over 1959. After the realization of this plan, the county will have an average of 2,000 jin of grain per person, and an average annual income of 250 yuan per person.

　　Huanjiang is a high and cold mountainous area where the Zhuang, Han, Maonan, and Yao ethnic groups live together. In 1958, it won the Guangxi Grain High-Yield Award, ending the history of food self-sufficiency. In 1959, agricultural production continued to achieve an unprecedented bumper harvest, with a total grain output of 250 million jin, an increase of 69.5% over 1958; an average yield of 805 jin per mu, achieving the targets set by the Agricultural Development Program eight years ahead of schedule. Calculated by population, the county had an average of 1,560 jin of grain per person. In order to strive for a greater leap forward in 1960, since the autumn harvest of 1959, the county has held a series of cadre meetings and mass meetings to conduct a nationwide large-scale visit, evaluation, and summary. On the one hand, they summed up successful experiences, and on the other hand, they found weak links and tapped production potential. After summing up, comparing, and accounting from top to bottom and from bottom to top, cadres and commune members unanimously believed that the situation in all aspects in 1960 was better than in 1959. All the county's distant fields and low-yield fields have been ploughed for the winter, grass has been cut and fields burned, and sufficient base fertilizer has been applied; there is also great potential for implementing reasonable close planting. According to surveys, many communes and brigades in 1959 did not have sufficient close planting. If this link is firmly grasped, it is estimated that production can be increased by more than 30%; in addition, building water conservancy projects, deep plowing to improve soil, and building large-scale field fertilizer stations are also important factors to ensure increased production.

　　The potential for increasing production of dryland crops is even greater. Last year, the Mei Dong Production Team of Changmei Commune, using intercropping of corn with soybeans and sweet potatoes on 65 mu of dry land, achieved an average yield equivalent to 754 jin of corn per mu. This experience can be fully promoted this year. This year, the county plans to plant 90,000 mu of dryland crops, and calculated at 700 jin per mu, a total of 63 million jin of grain will be produced, an increase of 89.7% over last year's total dryland grain output.

　　Reclaiming wasteland for cultivation is also an important aspect of tapping potential. Huanjiang County has wasteland slopes and ridges everywhere that can be planted, with thick topsoil and a lot of humus. After reclamation, high-yielding subtropical dryland crops can be planted. These crops are cold-resistant, barren-resistant, and labor-saving, and the yield is also very high. This year, the county plans to reclaim 200,000 mu of wasteland for planting cassava, 200,000 mu for planting velvet beans in pits, and 50,000 mu for planting pigeon peas along houses, roads, and fields.

　　Based on the above calculations alone, it is entirely possible to achieve a leap forward in agriculture in 1960. However, the most prominent contradiction is the shortage of labor. The total cultivated area of the county this year is 1.15 million mu. Adding industrial and sideline production, a total of 31.43 million workdays are required. The county currently has 68,852 laborers. Calculated at 330 workdays per person per year, a total of 22.72 million workdays can be contributed, with a shortfall of 8.71 million workdays. In order to solve this contradiction, the county is vigorously promoting cartization, new-style walking plowization, rice transplanterization, thresherization, processing mechanization, and water conservancy motorization. This will improve work efficiency and save 10.08 million workdays. To turn this possibility into reality, the key lies in having great enthusiasm. Under the unified leadership of the Huanjiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China, since last winter, all communes in the county, in conjunction with winter production, have vigorously carried out publicity and education on the general line, and recently held mass meetings to reward communes, brigades, production teams, and advanced pacesetters with outstanding production achievements last year, and completed the year-end distribution and over-contract production rewards.

　　In order to strengthen leadership over grassroots work, Party secretaries and members at all levels from the county party committee to the commune and brigade levels have gone deep into the grassroots, dividing areas and contracting tasks, paying special attention to strengthening leadership over remote areas and backward communes.

　　This newspaper reports: Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, which achieved an all-round leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries in 1959, has conscientiously summed up the experience of continuous leap forward in the past two years, analyzed the current favorable conditions, fully tapped the potential for increasing production, and formulated a leap forward plan for 1960, thus setting off a new upsurge of all-round leap forward in winter and spring production.

　　Jiangyin County encountered a major drought in 1959 that had not been seen in a century, but it achieved a bumper harvest that had not been seen in a thousand years. Total grain output increased by 17.3% over 1958, total cotton output increased by 17.5% over 1958, total oil crop output increased by 3.7% over 1958, pigs increased by 20.8% over 1958, and total output value of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries increased by 21.7% over 1958. On the basis of an all-round bumper harvest, by summarizing experience, the specific characteristics of Jiangyin County were analyzed to find the key to increasing production. These characteristics are: First, Jiangyin County has a large population and little land, with an average of only one mu of land per person, which has certain limitations on increasing total grain output and increasing income for commune members more quickly. However, on the other hand, due to the large population and little land, much can be done to increase unit yield. Second, there is ample labor to engage in diversified operations and increase income for commune members. Third, there are many mountains, a wide water surface, and abundant natural resources, which are good bases for developing forestry and aquatic products. Fourth, industry and handicrafts are relatively developed, which requires the support of agriculture and can also provide support to agriculture. Based on existing experience and the above characteristics, Jiangyin County's policy for developing agricultural production in the next few years is: to take grain, cotton, oil, and pigs as the lead, and drive the all-round leap forward of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, fisheries, and community-run industry and handicrafts, so as to build Jiangyin into a grain, cotton, oil, and pig production base with a high commodity rate as soon as possible. Under this general outline, the overall goals for 1960 are: grain to increase by 40%, cotton to increase by 33%, oil crops to increase by 12 times, and live pigs to increase by 2 times.

　　The main measures to achieve the above plans are:

　　First, persist in implementing the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, deeply carry out the socialist education movement, and further consolidate and expand the socialist ideological position in rural areas.

　　Second, the county will adjust the crop layout and appropriately expand the planting area of late rice to increase the yield per unit area. It is planned to expand the late rice area from 64,000 mu in 1959 to 170,000 mu in 1960, accounting for 18.8% of the county's rice area. The advantages of this adjustment are: ① It can stagger the summer planting season, adjust labor, and ensure that medium rice and late rice can be planted on time, which is conducive to increasing the yield per unit area. ② Late rice is planted late and has a long topdressing period, which can win more time to solve the contradiction between fertilizer needs and short time. ③ Medium rice stubble is planted with wheat, and late rice stubble is planted with green manure and rapeseed, which can still maintain Jiangyin's characteristics of high-yield early wheat.

　　Third, conscientiously implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, mainly focusing on the following points: ① Promote high-yield varieties and do a good job of stubble matching. ② Implement reasonable close planting to increase planting density. ③ Vigorously carry out water conservancy construction to ensure continuous leap forward in agricultural production. ④ Vigorously develop pig raising and increase the accumulation of stable manure. ⑤ Improve the level of field management and achieve horticultural field management. ⑥ Pest and disease control, tool reform, and other measures should also be earnestly grasped.

　　Fourth, do everything possible to increase the land utilization rate and expand the planting area as much as possible. The methods are: ① Plant fully and neatly, leaving no inch of land unused, and make a big fuss about the idle land in fields, ridges, and around houses. The county has more than 53,000 mu of idle land, and takes the method of linking it with large fields, so that the crops planted on idle land also have indicators, measures, and responsibilities. ② Increase the multiple cropping index, mainly by implementing intercropping and mixed cropping.

　　Fifth, organize all departments to serve agricultural production. Make full use of Jiangyin's developed industry and handicrafts, organize factories to link up with communes, and vigorously support agricultural production. Finance and trade departments should do a good job in supplying pesticides, agricultural machinery, agricultural tools, fertilizers, funds, etc., with each item planned in advance, prepared in advance, and supplied in advance. What production needs, do everything possible to supply, when it is needed, supply it.

    本报讯　今年的农业增产潜力有多大？如何挖掘潜力？广西环江县发动全民总结去年经验，找出薄弱环节，挖掘增产潜力，制定了1960年跃进规划。
    1960年，这个县粮食总产量计划达到三亿五千万斤，比1959年增产40％，实现亩产千斤县；经济作物计划总产值达四百九十六万元，比1959年增长88．3％；工业总产值计划达到一千六百五十万元，比1959年增长69．1％。实现这个规划后，全县平均每人有粮两千斤，每人全年平均收入可达二百五十元。
    环江是一个僮、汉、毛难、瑶四个民族杂居的高寒山区，1958年曾获得广西粮食高产奖，结束了粮食不能自给的历史。1959年，农业生产继续获得了空前大丰收，粮食总产量两亿五千万斤，比1958年增产69．5％；平均每亩产八百零五斤，提前八年实现了农业发展纲要规定的指标。按人口计算，全县平均每人有粮一千五百六十斤。为了争取1960年更大跃进，1959年秋收以后，这个县召开了一系列的干部大会、群众大会，进行全民性的大参观、大评比、大总结。一方面总结成功的经验，一方面找薄弱环节，挖生产潜力，经过自上而下和自下而上相结合的总结、对比、算账，干部和社员一致认为，1960年各方面的形势都比1959年更好。全县所有远田、低产田都做到了翻田过冬，刈草烧田，施足基肥；实行合理密植，也有很大潜力，据调查，1959年有不少公社、大队密植程度不够，如果抓紧这一环，估计可以增产30％以上；另外兴修水利、深耕改土、大造田间肥料站也是保证增产的重要因素。
    旱粮作物的增产潜力更大。去年长美公社美垌生产队，在六十五亩旱地上，利用玉米套种黄豆、红薯，平均亩产相当玉米七百五十四斤，这个经验，今年可以全面推广。今年全县规划种旱粮作物九万亩，以亩产七百斤计算，共产粮食六千三百万斤，比去年旱粮总产量可增加89．7％。
    垦荒扩种也是挖潜力的一个重要方面。环江县到处有可以种植的荒坡荒岭，表层肥厚，腐植质多，开垦之后，可以种植亚热带高产旱粮作物。这些作物耐寒耐瘠省工，产量也很高。全县今年计划开荒二十万亩种木薯，挖坑点种猫豆二十万亩，在屋边路边田边种木豆五万亩。
    仅就以上几笔大账，实现1960年农业的跃进是完全可能的。但是最突出的矛盾是劳动力不足。全县今年耕种总面积共一百一十五万亩，加上工业副业等生产，共需用工三千一百四十三万个，而全县现有劳动力六万八千八百五十二人，以每人每年出工三百三十个计算，共可出工二千二百七十二万多个，尚缺八百七十一万多个。为了解决这个矛盾，全县正在大搞车子化、新式步犁化、插秧机化、打谷机化、加工机械化、水利动力化。这样就可以提高工效节约劳动力一千零八万个工。要把这个可能变为现实，关键在于要有一个很大的干劲。在中共环江县委统一领导下，从去冬以来，全县各公社结合冬季生产，大张旗鼓地开展了总路线的宣传教育，最近又召开了群众大会，奖励了去年生产成绩优异的公社、大队、生产队和先进标兵，做好了年终分配与超包产奖励。
    各级党委为了加强对基层工作的领导，从县委到公社、大队的各级党委书记和委员已深入基层，分片包干，特别注意加强对边远地区和后进公社的领导。
    本报讯　1959年农林牧副渔全面跃进的江苏江阴县，认真总结了两年来连续大跃进经验，分析了当前有利条件，充分挖掘增产潜力，制订了1960年跃进的规划，从而掀起冬春生产全面跃进的新高潮。
    江阴县1959年遇到百年未有的大干旱，但却获得千年未有的大丰收。粮食总产量比1958年增长17．3％，棉花总产量比1958年增长17．5％，油料总产量比1958年增长3．7％，猪比1958年增长20．8％，农、林、牧、副、渔总产值比1958年增长21．7％。在全面丰收的基础上，通过总结经验，分析了江阴县的具体特点，以寻找增产关键。这些特点是：第一、江阴县人多田少，平均每人只有一亩多田，这对更快地增加粮食总产量和增加社员收入有一定的限度，但是另一方面，由于人多田少，可以在提高单位产量方面大做文章。第二、有充裕的劳动力，可以大搞多种经营，增加社员收入。第三、山地多，水面广，自然资源丰富，是发展林业和水产的良好基地。第四、工业和手工业比较发达，它需要农业的支援，也能给农业以支援。根据已有经验和上述特点，江阴县今后几年发展农业生产的方针是：以粮棉油猪挂帅，带动林牧副渔和社办工业、手工业的全面大跃进，把江阴尽快地建设成为有高度商品率的粮棉油猪生产基地。在这个总纲之下，1960年总的奋斗目标是：粮食增四成，棉花增三成三，油料增十二倍，生猪增二倍。
    实现上述规划的主要措施是：
    第一，坚持贯彻党的八届八中全会决议，深入开展社会主义教育运动，进一步巩固和扩大农村的社会主义思想阵地。
    第二，全县调整作物布局，适当扩大晚稻种植面积，提高单位面积产量。计划1960年把晚稻面积从1959年的六万四千亩扩大到十七万亩，占全县水稻面积的18．8％。这样调整的好处是：①能够扯开夏种季节，调剂劳力，保证中稻、晚稻能按时栽插，有利于提高单位面积产量。②晚稻插得迟，追肥期长，可以赢得更多的时间，解决肥料需要与时间短促的矛盾。③中稻茬口种麦子，晚稻茬口种绿肥、油菜，仍然可以保持江阴早麦高产的特点。
    第三，认真贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，主要是狠抓如下几点：①推广高产品种，做好茬口搭配。②实行合理密植增加栽插密度。③大搞水利建设，确保农业生产不断跃进。④大抓养猪，增积厩肥。⑤提高田间管理水平，做到田间管理园艺化。⑥防治病虫害、工具改革等措施，也要认真抓好。
    第四，千方百计提高土地利用率，尽可能扩大播种面积。办法是：①种满种齐，寸土不让，抓住田塍地边、屋前房后的空闲地大做文章。全县共有空闲地五万三千多亩，采取和大田挂钩的办法，使种在空闲地上的作物也做到有指标、有措施、有责任。②增加复种指数，主要是实行套种、夹种。
    第五，组织一切部门，为农业生产服务。充分利用江阴工业、手工业发达的特点，组织各工厂与公社挂钩，大力支援农业生产。财贸部门做好农药、农械、农具、肥料、资金等供应，项项计划在前，准备在前，供应在前，生产需要什么，千方百计供应什么，什么时候要，什么时候供应。
