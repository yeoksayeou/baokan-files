Xinhua News Agency, February 10th: The Japanese "Zenshinza" Theater Troupe, a group of 68 people led by the troupe leader ChoJuro Kawarasaki, deputy leader Utaemon Nakamura, and Gasei Miyakawa, arrived in Beijing by train this afternoon. The troupe is visiting China for performances upon the invitation of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.

The guests were enthusiastically welcomed at the Beijing Railway Station by Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, Yang Hansheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, and others. Actors from the capital presented the guests with flowers. Among those welcoming them were renowned figures in literary and art circles such as Tian Han, Ouyang Yuqian, Lü Ji, Ma Shaobo, Wu Xue, Ouyang Shanzun, Li Shaochun, and Yuan Shihai. Many of them had visited Japan before, and today old friends met, shaking hands and embracing, their friendship deep.

Japanese peace activist Kinkazu Saionji and Korean peace activist Hwang Bong-koo in Beijing were also at the station to welcome them.

Troupe leader ChoJuro Kawarasaki spoke on behalf of the "Zenshinza" Theater Troupe at the station, expressing his respect for the Chinese people who have achieved great accomplishments under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. He said: Our visit to China for performances upon the invitation of our Chinese friends is encouraged by the Japanese people, who hope that we, small as we are, can become a bridge for friendship and the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries through this cultural exchange. Therefore, the Japanese people wholeheartedly congratulate and bid farewell to us.

He said: Comrade Utaemon Nakamura, one of the founders of the Zenshinza Theater Troupe, had long been cared for by friends in China. After overcoming many difficulties, he is now able to stand vigorously at the Beijing Railway Station, five years after leaving China. This can be said to be the result of the close unity of the people of the two countries, and we sincerely express our gratitude for this.

He said: The Kishi Nobusuke government, in violation of the will and wishes of the Japanese people, colluded with US imperialism and signed a new "Security Treaty". However, the history of mankind to date proves that it is bound to go bankrupt.

He concluded by saying that this performance is supported by the friendship closely forged between the people of the two countries and the forces demanding world peace, and we believe that the performance will be a success. Once again, thank you for your sincere welcome, and we are determined to work hard to make this performance a success.

The troupe leader's speech was warmly welcomed.

For the thirty years since its founding, the Japanese "Zenshinza" Theater Troupe has consistently been a Kabuki theater troupe whose responsibility is to reform Japanese national drama and dedicate itself to national progress and world peace. During their visit to China, they will perform four excellent plays: "Kanjincho", "Shunkan", "Narukami", and "Sakura Sogoro".
