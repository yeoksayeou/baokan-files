Promote Commune-Run Industry, Provide High-Quality Fertilizer
Wangji Commune Utilizes Biogas to Develop Production

(Reported by this newspaper) Wangji People's Commune in Suining County, Jiangsu Province, famous throughout the country for vigorously launching a mass movement to build biogas digesters, has, after a year and a half of arduous efforts, built six large-scale biogas digesters with a total volume of 1,850 cubic meters (the largest one has 1,000 cubic meters) and some small biogas digesters, with good gas production.

Biogas provides power for the Wangji Commune's farm tool factory and cement factory. The farm tool factory uses biogas to drive electric drills, greatly improving work efficiency; the cement factory uses biogas to drive blowers to replace manual sieving, which not only reduces the labor of workers but also increases work efficiency by 1.5 to 2 times, and the quality of cement has increased from more than 200 grade to 317 grade. A 144-cubic-meter biogas digester drives a 4.5-horsepower gas engine, processing about 100,000 jin of grain a year, saving 7,000 labor days. Two cotton ginning machines driven by biogas can gin 450 jin of cotton per day, equivalent to the workload of twelve people and twelve donkeys per day. The 1,000-cubic-meter biogas digester that was recently put into production drives three steel grinding discs and five improved stone grinding discs with a 45-horsepower gas engine during the day, processing about 10,000 jin of grain per day, saving 100 jin of kerosene and more than 200 man-days every day; at night, it drives a 15-kilowatt generator, and the daily power generation can supply lighting for more than 500 25- to 40-watt incandescent lamps. The cost of this biogas digester was only more than 12,000 yuan, while the annual output value is more than 40,000 yuan. The widespread use of biogas has also promoted the development of the building materials industry such as cement, bricks, and lime, and enabled the commune's sugar-making, cotton ginning, and other industries to transition from manual operation to semi-mechanization and mechanization.

Vigorously developing biogas provides a large amount of high-quality fertilizer for agricultural production. According to the Wangji Commune's analysis, after manure and garbage are matured and fermented in the biogas digester, not only are all the insect eggs and weed seeds mixed in the fertilizer killed, but the available nitrogen is increased by 35%, and the available phosphorus and potassium are also increased accordingly. The results of a comparative experiment conducted by the Wangji Commune on two pieces of corn land with the same area, soil quality, fertilization frequency, and processing management showed that the corn stalks fertilized with biogas residue were 12% heavier than those fertilized with ordinary fertilizer, the ears were 7% more, and the yield was 8% higher.

The Wangji Commune also uses biogas for living purposes. A small 2.5-cubic-meter biogas digester in the commune can boil more than 10 jin of water and cook more than 10 jin of sweet potatoes in half an hour; biogas can also be used for lighting after being ignited. At present, some teams have begun to build some medium-sized digesters for lighting and cooking in public canteens.

The significant achievements of Wangji Commune in utilizing biogas are the result of adhering to the General Line, adhering to the spirit of continuous revolution, and vigorously launching mass movements. In June 1958, the commune's Party committee put forward a plan to vigorously develop biogas, and selected four cadres to be specifically responsible for it, and ran a training class to train more than 500 activists for the entire commune, and established a one-line professional leading organization in the entire commune. In this way, a mass biogas development movement quickly emerged throughout the commune. After two or three months, the entire commune built many small earthen biogas digesters, with an average of one biogas digester for every twenty households, and one 30-cubic-meter biogas digester for each team.

After the widespread establishment of small biogas digesters, a problem arose: almost all biogas digesters were either leaking water or leaking gas. In order to solve this problem, the commune's Party committee, while widely mobilizing the masses to contribute ideas, established a technical professional team of forty people to vigorously tackle technical problems. They put forward the slogan "With ambition, we are not afraid of great difficulties, and we must climb even if Kunlun is high." Hu Sixian, a worker from a peasant background, based on the principle that oil baskets can be made leak-proof by mixing pig blood, old flour, and tung oil, solved the problem of biogas digester leakage after several experiments. Through the painstaking research of the professional team and the active efforts of the masses, they also quickly solved several more important key technical problems such as digester construction, material preparation, mixing, and fermentation. On July 15, 1958, Wangji Commune lit up the first electric light generated by biogas. The emergence of this event in this remote village caused great excitement among the people. The next day, more than 3,000 peasants from dozens of miles around came to visit. Soon, medium-sized and large-sized biogas digesters were built one after another.

In the process of building large digesters, the prominent contradiction was how to allocate labor. At that time, agricultural production felt that there was insufficient labor, and the construction of biogas digesters required a considerable amount of labor. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient labor for digester construction, the commune's Party committee mobilized 8,000 migrant workers on the water conservancy construction site to bring a cart of stones each after work. In just three days, they transported the stone slabs, stones, and bricks needed for digester construction. At the same time, it mobilized institutions, schools, and residents of market towns to carry out a fertilizer accumulation and grass cutting campaign, which solved the need for fermentation materials for biogas digesters.

    促进社办工业　提供优质肥料
    王集公社利用沼气发展生产
    本报讯　以大搞群众运动办沼气而著名全国的江苏睢宁县王集人民公社，经过一年半的艰苦努力，建成了总容积一千八百五十立方米的大型沼气池六个（最大的一个有一千立方米）和一些小沼气池，出气情况良好。
    沼气给王集公社农具厂和水泥厂提供了动力。农具厂用沼气带动电钻，大大提高了工效；水泥厂用沼气带动鼓风机代替人工箩筛，不仅减轻了工人的劳动，还提高工效一倍半到二倍，水泥质量由二百多标号提高到三百一十七标号。一个一百四十四立方米的沼气池带动了四个半马力的煤气机，一年加工粮食十万斤左右，节约了七千个劳动日。用沼气带动的两个弹花机，一天能弹棉花四百五十斤，等于十二个人和十二条驴一天的工作量。最近投入生产的一千立方米的沼气池，白天发动四十五马力煤气机带动三盘钢磨、五盘改良石磨，每天加工粮食一万斤左右，每天可节省煤油一百斤，人工二百多个；晚上发动十五瓩发电机，每日发电量能供五百多个二十五到四十支光电灯照明。这个沼气池的成本只花了一万二千多元，而一年的产值就有四万多元。沼气的广泛利用，还促进了水泥、砖瓦、石灰等建筑材料工业的发展，使公社制糖、弹花等工业从手工操作向半机械化、机械化过渡。
    大办沼气，为农业生产提供了大量优质肥料。据王集公社化验，粪便、垃圾在沼气池经过腐熟、发酵之后，不仅混藏在肥料中的虫卵、草籽全部杀死，而且速效氮提高了35％，速效磷钾也相应增加。王集公社在两块面积、土质、施肥次数和加工管理相同的玉米地上对比试验的结果，施沼气渣的玉米秸秆比施一般肥的重12％，棒子多7％，产量高8％。
    王集公社，还将沼气用于生活方面。公社的一只二点五立方米的小沼气池，能在半小时内烧开十多斤水和烧熟十多斤山芋；沼气体点燃后还可照明。目前有些队已着手建筑一些中型池，供公共食堂照明和做饭。
    王集公社利用沼气的工作，能够取得显著的成绩，是坚持总路线、坚持不断革命精神、大搞群众运动的结果。1958年6月，公社党委提出大搞沼气的计划，抽出四个干部专门负责，办了一个训练班，为全社训练五百多名积极分子，并在全社成立了一条线的专业领导组织。这样，一个群众性的办沼气运动迅速的在全社兴起。两三个月后，全社办起了许多小型土沼气池，平均每二十家就有一个沼气池，每队有一个三十立方米的沼气池。
    小型沼气池普遍建立起来之后，发生了一个问题；所有的沼气池几乎不是漏水，就是漏气。社党委为了解决这个问题，在广泛发动群众献计的同时，成立了四十个人的技术专业队伍，猛攻技术关。提出了“有志不怕困难大，昆仑再高也要爬”的口号。农民出身的工人胡泗先根据装油的篓子用猪血、老粉、桐油混合涂上可以不漏的原理，经过几次试验，沼气池漏水的问题解决了。经过专业队伍的苦心钻研和群众的积极努力，又迅速解决了建池、配料、搅拌、发酵等几个比较重要的关键性的技术问题。1958年7月15日，王集公社亮起了用沼气发电的第一盏电灯。这件事情在这一个偏僻的乡村出现，引起了人们极大的振奋。第二天，周围几十里，三千多农民赶来参观。不久中型的大型的沼气池，一个一个的建立起来了。
    在大型池子的兴建过程中，突出的矛盾是如何调配。当时，正是农业生产感到劳力不够，而沼气池的建筑，又必须支出相当数量的劳力。为了解决建池劳力不足的困难，社党委动员水利工地上的八千民工，在下工后每人带一车石子，仅三天时间，就运来建池所需用的石板、石子、青砖。同时又发动机关、学校、集镇居民开展积肥、割草运动，解决了沼气池发酵原料的需要。
