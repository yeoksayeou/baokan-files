Xinhua News Agency, February 24th: Across the country, technical transformations are being carried out in small and medium-sized ferrous metallurgy mines that made great contributions during the Great Leap Forward in steel production in 1958 and 1959, in order to produce more and better iron ore for the country. According to relevant departments, since last winter, provinces such as Shandong, Henan, Sichuan, and Hunan have already begun technical transformation work in the first batch of over one hundred mines.

Strengthening the technical transformation of small and medium-sized ferrous metallurgy mines is one of the major measures taken by the metallurgical industry department to ensure the continued leap forward in steel production this year. Most small and medium-sized mines, established during the Great Leap Forward in Steel in 1958, have undergone preliminary transformations in 1959 through “Five Determinations” (determining location, type, group, personnel, and leadership) and “Two-izations” (base-ization and factory-ization), and their production capacity has gradually increased. According to the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry's estimates, the output of small and medium-sized mines will account for about half of the total national iron ore output this year; the proportion of output from small and medium-sized mines will be even greater in auxiliary raw materials for steel production. However, most small mines still rely on manual mining and manual loading and transportation of ore, lacking power, transportation, and mining equipment. Therefore, labor efficiency is still relatively low, and production costs are relatively high. Technical transformation of small and medium-sized mines can not only further increase ore production but also improve ore quality and reduce the production cost of ore.

The main contents of the technical transformation of small and medium-sized mines are: improving transportation conditions inside and outside the mines, increasing transportation efficiency; reforming mining methods; increasing mining equipment, increasing mining efficiency; building simple washing and beneficiation equipment to improve ore quality; strengthening exploration work to understand resources and create conditions for mine construction; etc. Before starting the technical transformation of small and medium-sized mines, provinces such as Shandong, Henan, Sichuan, and Hunan first made plans and then transformed them in stages and batches. Shandong Province, which started work earlier, had already changed manual operations in some mines by the end of last year, realizing indigenous mechanization, semi-mechanization, or small-scale mechanization. The average mining efficiency in Shandong Province in the fourth quarter of last year was more than twice that of the first quarter. Most of the mines in Sichuan Province are mined underground, and transportation conditions are difficult. During the transformation process, each mine built more than 12,000 kilometers of roads inside the mining area and from the mining area to the blast furnace, including railway flat steel wooden rail roads, simple highways, earthen cableways, chutes, and cable car roads, partially eliminating the heavy labor of carrying on human backs and shoulders, and improving transportation efficiency. After the Jialing Iron Mine was transformed, the number of employees was reduced by 40% compared with the past, but the daily output increased by more than one time, and the production cost per ton of iron ore was reduced by one-fourth.

The guiding principle for the technical transformation of small and medium-sized mines in various places is: rely on the masses, self-reliance, use local materials, and combine indigenous and foreign methods. After the Xiangshan Iron Mine in Shandong was transformed in accordance with this principle, its production capacity increased from 160,000 tons per year to 400,000 tons in just a few months. In terms of rock drilling and mining, the workers created a variety of indigenous machines. These indigenous machines, together with the pneumatic drills allocated by the leadership department, completely replaced the original manual drilling. In terms of transportation, light rails, wooden rails, chutes, and cableways were laid from the mining area to nearby railway stations and between the various mining areas inside the mine, and indigenous winches and powered winches were installed, realizing indigenous mechanization of transportation and hoisting. The mining area originally used oil lamps for lighting. Now, the workers built simple factory buildings with mats and used old car heads to drive small generators, solving the problem of electricity for production and lighting. In order to improve the quality of ore, the workers, on the one hand, manufactured indigenous washing machines to select ore with water; on the other hand, they self-reliantly built a small beneficiation plant. The experience of Xiangshan Iron Mine has been organized and promoted by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry in mines across the country. (Attached pictures)

    为钢铁工业继续跃进供应充足原料
    中小铁矿技术改造立竿见影
    手工操作大大减少，采矿效率、运输效率和矿石质量迅速提高
    新华社24日讯　全国各地正在对1958、1959年钢铁生产大跃进中立下汗马功劳的中小型黑色冶金矿山，进行技术改造，以便为国家生产更多更好的铁矿石。据有关部门了解，山东、河南、四川、湖南等省自去冬以来，已经在第一批一百多个矿山，开始了技术改造工作。
    加强中小型黑色冶金矿山技术改造，是冶金工业部门保证今年钢铁生产继续跃进的重大措施之一。大部分中、小矿山自1958年大炼钢铁时兴办起来后，在1959年都经过五定（定点、定型、定组、定员和定领导）、二化（基地化、工厂化）等初步改造，生产能力逐步提高。据冶金工业部预计，今年全国铁矿石总产量中，中小型矿山的产量将占一半左右；在钢铁生产辅助原料中，中小型矿山的产量所占的比重更大。但是，绝大部分的小矿山，目前还是手工开采和人工装运矿石，缺少动力、运输和采掘设备。因此，劳动效率还比较低，生产成本比较高。对中小型矿山进行技术改造，不但可以进一步提高矿石产量，还能改进矿石质量，降低矿石的生产成本。
    中小型矿山技术改造的主要内容是：改造矿山内外的运输条件，提高运输效率，改革采矿方法：增加采掘设备，提高采矿效率；建设简易的洗选设备，提高矿石质量；加强勘探工作，摸清资源，为矿山建设创立条件；等等。山东、河南、四川、湖南等省在开始进行中小型矿山技术改造之前，都是先作出规划，然后分期分批地改造。工作开展得较早的山东省，去年年底已经有一部分矿山改变了手工操作，实现了土机械化、半机械化或小型机械化；去年第四季度山东全省的平均采矿效率，比第一季度提高了两倍多。四川省的矿山大部分是坑内开采，运输条件困难。在改造的过程中，各矿山修建了一万二千多公里矿区内部的和从矿区通往高炉的道路，包括铁路扁钢木轨路、简易公路、土索道、溜槽、缆车道等，部分地消灭了人背肩挑的繁重劳动，提高了运输效率。加山铁矿经过改造以后，职工人数比过去减少了40％，日产量却提高了一倍多，每吨铁矿石的生产成本降低了四分之一。
    各地中、小型矿山技术改造的方针是：依靠群众，自力更生，就地取材，土洋结合。山东祥山铁矿依照这个方针改造以后，在短短几个月里，生产能力就由过去的年产十六万吨提高到四十万吨。在凿岩采矿方面，职工们创造了多种土机械，这些土机械同领导部门调给的风钻一起使用，全部代替了原来的手工打眼。在运输方面，从矿区到附近火车站和矿山内部各采矿区之间，都铺设了轻轨铁路和木轨、溜坡、索道，装上了土卷扬机和动力卷扬机，实现了运输、提升土机械化。这个矿区原来用油灯照明，现在，职工们用席子搭起简易厂房，利用旧汽车头带动小型发电机，解决了生产和照明用电问题。为提高矿石质量，职工们一方面制造了土法淘洗机，用水选矿石；一方面自力更生地建设了一座小型选矿厂。祥山铁矿的经验，已由冶金工业部在全国矿山中组织推广。（附图片）
