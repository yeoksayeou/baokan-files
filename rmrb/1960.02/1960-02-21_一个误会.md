    A Misunderstanding
    In the article "Talking about Guilin with its Wonderful Mountains and Rivers" written by Comrade Shigong, published on the eighth page of the January 12th issue, when discussing the various strange rocks in Guilin, a quote from Liu Zongyuan was used ("Their rocks jutting out angrily, lying down and recoiling, carrying earth and emerging, contending to be strange shapes, are almost countless..."). As far as we know, this passage comes from the article "Record of the Small Hill West of the Coarse Alum Pool." The Coarse Alum Pool is located in Lingling County, Hunan Province today. Therefore, Liu Zongyuan's "wonderful description" should be about the strange rocks on a small hill near the Coarse Alum Pool in Lingling County, not about the strange rocks somewhere near Guilin. Comrade Shigong believes that this passage was written by Liu Zongyuan after admiring the scenery of Guilin, out of "astonishment," which is probably a misunderstanding.

    一个误会
    1月12日第八版刊载的石工同志写的“山奇水秀话桂林”一文中，在谈到桂林的形态万千的怪石时，引用了柳宗元的一段话（“其石之突怒偃蹇、负土而出、争为奇状者，殆不可数……”）据我们所知，这段话出自“钴鉧潭西小丘记”一文。钴鉧潭在今湖南省零陵县境内，因此，柳宗元的这一“精彩的描述”当是写的零陵县境内钴鉧潭附近某一小丘上的怪石，而不是桂林附近某地的怪石。石工同志认为这段话是柳宗元观赏了桂林的山水后，“惊叹”之余写出来的，这恐怕是一个误会。	  吉林师范大学俄语系　道治
