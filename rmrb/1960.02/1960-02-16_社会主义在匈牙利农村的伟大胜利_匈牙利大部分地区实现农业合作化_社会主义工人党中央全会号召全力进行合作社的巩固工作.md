Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, February 14th: According to today's "People's Liberty News," the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party held a plenary meeting on February 12th.

The meeting heard a report by János Kádár, First Secretary of the Party Central Committee, on the exchange of experiences in agricultural development among the Communist and Workers' Parties of European socialist countries, and the meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty Organization. The meeting also heard a report by Feher, a member of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee, on the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement and the implementation of the resolution on consolidating production cooperatives adopted by the Party Central Committee on October 22nd last year.

The Central Committee unanimously adopted the above two reports and passed a resolution on the development achievements and future tasks of agricultural production cooperatives.

"People's Liberty News" also published today the Hungarian Party Central Committee's communique on developing the agricultural cooperativization movement and consolidating production cooperatives. The communique pointed out that since the Party Central Committee adopted the resolution on October 22, 1959, the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement has achieved greater success. From November 1st last year to February 7th this year, another 380,000 working peasants across the country have embarked on the road of socialist large-scale agricultural production. The total number of agricultural production cooperatives nationwide has increased to 870,000, with a total cultivated area of 5.2 million hectares. Currently, 70% of the country's arable land belongs to agricultural production cooperatives and state farms. Two thousand three hundred villages and towns across the country (accounting for 70% of the country's villages and towns) have been fully cooperativized, and there are 76 cooperativized districts nationwide.

The communique emphasized that these achievements are a great victory for Hungary's social system, the agricultural policy of the Socialist Workers' Party, and the common efforts of the working class and the working peasants. This victory has further consolidated the people's power and the worker-peasant alliance, bringing us closer to the goal of completing the groundwork for socialism put forward by the Party's Seventh Congress.

The communique pointed out that the agricultural production situation in 1959 confirmed that the goal of improving production levels is entirely achievable while developing the agricultural cooperativization movement on a large scale. Last year, both agricultural production and commodity production of the cooperatives greatly exceeded the level of 1958. Old cooperatives have greatly surpassed individual farmers in all aspects of production, and newly established cooperatives have also surpassed individual farmers in crop production.

The communique stated that the Party Central Committee believes that the most important task at present is to concentrate efforts on consolidating the cooperatives and strengthening political and ideological work. First, the work of accelerating the establishment and strengthening of party organizations and Communist Youth League organizations in cooperatives should be accelerated. In recent weeks, the strength of the members should be concentrated on preparing for spring plowing and sowing and accelerating the construction of cooperatives.

The communique pointed out that for the benefit of the entire national economy, agricultural cooperatives should continue to increase the planting area of ​​corn and potatoes in the spring, and the pig industry should be vigorously developed throughout the country.

The communique went on to say that in the future, the state will continue to help individual farmers through price policies and contract systems.

Finally, the communique called on the Hungarian working class to vigorously support agriculture, produce more and better agricultural machinery, building materials, chemical fertilizers and other products in the labor competition to welcome the 15th anniversary of Hungary's liberation. It called on agricultural and financial experts and veteran cooperative leaders working in various departments to provide assistance to newly established cooperatives.

    社会主义在匈牙利农村的伟大胜利
    匈牙利大部分地区实现农业合作化
    社会主义工人党中央全会号召全力进行合作社的巩固工作
    新华社布达佩斯14日电　据“人民自由报”今天报道：匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会2月12日举行了全体会议。
    会议听取了党中央第一书记卡达尔所作的关于欧洲社会主义国家共产党和工人党交流农业发展经验代表会议和华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会会议的情况的报告。会议还听取了党中央政治局委员费赫尔所作的有关农业合作化运动的发展情况和党中央去年10月22日所通过的关于巩固生产合作社的决议的执行情况的报告。
    中央委员会一致通过了上述两个报告，并且通过了关于农业生产合作社的发展成果和今后任务的决议。
    “人民自由报”今天还发表了匈牙利党中央关于发展农业合作化运动和巩固生产合作社的公报。公报指出，自党中央1959年10月22日通过决议以来，农业合作化运动的发展取得了更大的成就。从去年11月1日到今年2月7日为止，全国又有三十八万个劳动农民走上了社会主义农业大生产的道路。全国农业生产合作社的总数增加到了八十七万个，它们的耕地面积共达五百二十万霍尔特。目前全国有70％的耕地属于农业生产合作社和国营农场。全国已经有二千三百个村镇（占全国70％的村镇）全部合作化，全国合作化的区有七十六个。
    公报强调说，这些成就是匈牙利的社会制度、社会主义工人党的农业政策、工人阶级和劳动农民的共同的伟大胜利，这一胜利进一步巩固了人民政权和工农联盟，更加接近了党的第七次代表大会所提出的结束社会主义奠基工作的指标。
    公报指出，1959年的农业生产情况证实，在大规模发展农业合作化运动的同时，提高生产水平的目标是完全可以达到的。去年合作社的农业生产和商品生产都大大地超过了1958年的水平。老社在生产的各个方面都大大地超过了个体农民，新成立的合作社也在农作物生产方面超过了个体农民。
    公报说，党中央认为，当前最主要的任务是集中力量进行合作社的巩固工作，并且加强政治思想工作，首先应该加速建立和加强合作社的党组织和共青团组织的工作。最近几周内应该集中社员的力量做好春耕、春播的准备工作和加快合作社的建设工作。
    公报指出，为了整个国民经济的利益，各农业合作社春季应该继续增加玉米和土豆的播种面积，全国各地应该大力发展养猪业。
    公报接着说，今后国家还将通过价格政策和订合同制度来帮助个体农民。
    公报最后号召匈牙利工人阶级在迎接匈牙利解放十五周年的劳动竞赛中，大力支援农业、生产出更多、更好的农业机器、建筑器材、化学肥料和其他产品；号召在各部门工作的农业和财经专家、老合作社社长们给新成立的合作社以帮助。
