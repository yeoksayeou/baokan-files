Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 21st: Guangdong is breaking with convention; people's communes in various regions are planting sugarcane more than two months earlier than in previous years and are doing everything possible to expand the planting area, striving for a large increase in sugarcane production this year. As of the 18th of this month, the area already sown with new root sugarcane and managed ratooned sugarcane has reached 87% of this year's planned area, exceeding the actual harvested area of last year by more than 50%. At present, various regions are seizing the opportunity to rush planting. The sugarcane that has already been planted has a high germination rate, strong buds, and is growing well due to early and good management. Some of the newly planted sugarcane has grown to one to three feet tall, and ratooned sugarcane has generally grown to four to five feet tall.

Multiple planting and early planting are two important measures for Guangdong to strive for a large increase in sugarcane production this year. This year, the province plans to plant more than 75% more sugarcane than the actual harvested area last year, which is 30% more than the year with the most sugarcane planting in history. According to several years of experience, early planting of sugarcane has many benefits: first, early planting has a long growing period, high yield, and high sugar content; second, early planting and early growth, strong stems and hard bones, strong resistance to insect pests; third, it can be staggered with the spring plowing season of grain production, easing the tension of labor; fourth, early planting and early harvest can advance the crushing season and support sugar factories to increase production.

Sufficient base fertilizer, good seedlings, and high planting quality are the characteristics of sugarcane planting in Guangdong this year. Before planting, many areas carefully select high-yielding and high-quality seedlings and use lime to soak the seeds to promote germination; the sugarcane fields are mostly deeply ploughed, loosened, and have sufficient base fertilizer applied.

Many regions have also established large-scale high-yield fields in continuous areas during the rush planting of sugarcane.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 21st: Sugarcane planting work in Guangxi has entered a climax. As of the 15th, the planting plan for new root sugarcane in the entire autonomous region has been completed 54.4%. Counties (cities) with faster progress, such as Liucheng, Guiping, Nanning, and Guixian, have basically completed or exceeded the planting plan.

Guangxi's sugar industry has developed rapidly. In order to ensure the supply of raw materials needed by mechanized sugar factories, the planned sugarcane planting area in the entire region this year will be expanded by about 60% compared to last year.

This year, there is a major reform in the development of sugarcane production in Guangxi, which is to establish sugarcane bases around sugar factories. In the past, sugarcane planting in Guangxi was very scattered, and some sugar factories had to transport sugarcane from fifty or sixty miles or even farther. Due to the long distance and insufficient transportation capacity, sugarcane was often accumulated in the producing areas, while the sugar factories were not full. Establishing sugarcane bases around sugar factories can solve this problem.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 21st: Fujian Province has advanced the planting of sugarcane, and the early planting has already begun to germinate.

This year, the sugarcane planting work in Fujian Province has been prepared earlier, generally starting one or two seasons earlier than in previous years, and the progress is fast and the quality is good; and a large number of wasteland has been newly reclaimed to expand the planting area. In December last year, the people's communes in Xianyou County prepared for seed retention and the plowing, leveling, and base fertilization of sugarcane fields while harvesting and crushing sugarcane at the same time. Therefore, this spring, in just over half a month, they completed the expansion plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the plan, expanding the planting area by nearly 30,000 mu compared to last year.

In order to realize the planting plan of multiple planting, high yield, and multiple harvests, all major producing areas are led by the secretaries, absorbing old farmers and technicians to participate, organizing technical guidance institutions, holding technical training classes, comprehensively summarizing and promoting various effective yield-increasing technologies over the years, so that this year's sugarcane is planted more and better. The planted sugarcane generally adopts good varieties such as Taiwan Sugar "134", implements lime water seed soaking, double-row strip planting with close spacing, increases the number of plants planted per unit area, and applies a large amount of base fertilizer more than in previous years.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 21st: Neijiang Prefecture, the main sugarcane producing area in Sichuan Province, is advancing the planting of sugarcane early in the spirit of "one early is a hundred early". As of the 13th, the task of planting sugarcane in the entire region has been completed 83%.

The Neijiang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a sugarcane sowing meeting as early as the beginning of February to make specific arrangements for the work of advancing the planting of sugarcane. A wave of rush planting was then launched in various places. Neijiang County mobilized more than 30,000 people and adopted the method of large-scale operations, planting more than 15,000 mu in one week. Zizhong County completed 70% of the planting plan in ten days due to sufficient preparation work. During the rush planting period, all sugar factories sent a large number of cadres and supplied a large amount of fertilizer to support sugarcane farmers in production. This year's planting work in Neijiang Prefecture not only started early, but also had high quality. The sugarcane that has already been planted has fully implemented advanced measures such as deep plowing, wide ditches, flat bottoms, close planting, and sufficient fertilizer. Generally, it is deeply ploughed one foot, 10,000 jin of compost is applied per mu, 40 to 50 dan of water manure, and the planting amount reaches 3,000 to 4,000 heads. (Picture attached)

    广东广西福建早种多种甘蔗
    四川内江专区放种甘蔗做到深耕密植肥足
    据新华社广州21日电　广东各地人民公社打破常规，比往年提早两个多月种植甘蔗，并千方百计扩大种植面积，力争今年甘蔗大增产。到本月18日止，全省已经播种的新根蔗和经过管理的宿根蔗面积，已达今年计划面积87％，超过去年实收面积50％以上。目前各地正在乘胜抢种。已经种植的甘蔗，由于管得早、管得好，发芽率高，芽头茁壮，长势很好。新种甘蔗有些已长到一尺到三尺高，宿根蔗已普遍长到四、五尺高。
    多种与早种，是广东今年争取甘蔗大增产的两项重要措施。今年全省计划种蔗面积比去年实收面积扩大75％以上，比历史上种蔗最多的年份还多30％。根据几年来的经验，提早种蔗有许多好处：第一、早种生长期长，产量高，糖分多；第二、早种早生，茎壮骨硬，抵抗虫害能力强；第三、可和粮食生产的春耕大忙季节错开，缓和劳动力的紧张情况；第四、早种早收，可以提早开榨季节，支援糖厂增产。
    基肥足、种苗好、种植质量高，是广东今年种植甘蔗的特点。许多地区在种植前，都认真挑选高产优质的种苗和采用石灰浸种催芽；蔗地大都经过深翻、松土，下足基肥。
    许多地区在抢种甘蔗中还建立了连片的大面积丰产田。
    据新华社南宁21日电　广西甘蔗种植工作进入高潮。到15日止，全自治区新根蔗的种植计划已经完成了54．4％。进度较快的柳城、桂平、南宁、贵县等县（市）已基本完成或者超额完成了种植计划。
    广西制糖工业有了迅速发展，为了保证供应机榨糖厂所需的原料，今年全区甘蔗种植面积计划比去年扩大60％左右。
    今年广西在发展甘蔗生产中，有一个很大的改革，就是围绕糖厂建立甘蔗基地。过去广西的甘蔗种植很分散，有的糖厂要从五、六十里甚至更远的地方运蔗来，由于路程远和运力不足，往往发生甘蔗产地积压，而糖厂又吃不饱的现象。围绕糖厂建立甘蔗基地，就可以解决这个问题。
    据新华社福州21日电　福建省提前种植甘蔗，早种的已经开始萌芽。
    今年，福建省甘蔗种植工作由于提早作好准备，一般都比往年提前一、二个季节开始，而且进度快，质量好；并且新垦出大批荒地，扩大种植面积。仙游县各人民公社去年12月在边收边榨甘蔗的同时，就作好留种和蔗田的翻犁、整畦、下基肥等准备工作，因此今春仅半个多月就提前超额完成扩种计划，比去年扩大种植面积近三万亩。
    为了实现多种、高产、多收的种植计划，各主要产区都由书记挂帅，吸收老农、技术员参加，组织技术指导机构，举办技术训练班，全面总结和推广历年来行之有效的各种增产技术，使今年的甘蔗种得多、种得好。已种下的甘蔗，普遍采用台糖“一三四”等良种，实行石灰水浸种、双行条播密植，增加了单位面积种植株数，并比往年多施了大量基肥。
    据新华社成都21日电　四川省甘蔗主要产地——内江专区，本着“一早百早”的精神提早放种甘蔗。到13日止，全区种植甘蔗的任务已完成了83％。
    中共内江地委会早在2月初就召开了甘蔗播种会议，对提早放种甘蔗的工作作了具体部署。各地随即掀起了放种热潮。内江县出动了三万多人，采取大兵团作战的方法，一周内就种了一万五千多亩。资中县由于准备工作充分，在十天内即完成了放种计划70％。在突击放种期间，各糖厂都派出大批干部和供应大量肥料，支援蔗农生产。内江专区今年放种工作不仅开始早，而且质量高。已经放种的甘蔗，全部贯彻了深耕、宽沟、底平、密植、肥足等先进措施。一般深耕一尺，每亩施堆肥一万斤，水粪四十到五十担，放种量达三千头到四千头。（附图片）
