A year and four months have passed since the Representative Conference of Quyi Workers and the First National Quyi Performance were held in August 1958. In this period, under the guidance of the Party's general line for socialist construction, our socialist construction cause is developing rapidly. With the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and cultural and artistic undertakings, Quyi work is also making a great leap forward. The current report-back performance of excellent Quyi programs organized by the Ministry of Culture is an exhibition and exchange of the achievements of the Quyi leap forward in the capital.

Participating in this report-back performance are actors from some provinces, cities, and Quyi troupes, performing seventy-five programs covering twenty-five different Quyi genres. 80% of these programs are based on modern themes. They sing about the new people and new events of the Great Leap Forward in steel production and the people's communes, the heroes of industrial and agricultural production and service industries, the story of the Red Army's Long March, and the martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the Party and the people. In short, the vast majority are praising the achievements created by the people. Some also expose the embarrassing situation of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Here, I will only give a brief introduction to a few works of each type.

Kuaiban (rhythmic storytelling) is a relatively simple form of Quyi with a wide mass base. The kuaiban "Qinghai is Good" is vividly written. The theme of the work is to give a correct introduction to Qinghai Province, which is misunderstood by the masses in the inland as a remote and desolate place. The author uses the technique of comparing the new and the old to make a clear contrast between Qinghai under the rule of Ma Bufang in the old days and Qinghai after the people became masters of their own affairs today; at the same time, he also uses figurative language to vividly depict the natural environment of Qinghai, and then enthusiastically praises the leap forward construction of Qinghai under the leadership of the Party today. The author inserts the tragic situation of Qinghai in the old days at any time, naturally creating jokes. The description of Qinghai's production of borax in the work is very vivid. It says that the situation in the old days was: "So much borax is ignored, and the British secretly transport it out. Our own treasures are not exploited, and we buy it from the British when we need it. Borax is smuggled from Tibet, and then imported from Hong Kong; they steal things and brag, saying that borax is produced in England."

This work also describes Qinghai's past transportation very vividly: "The car shakes its head when it drives, and people shake coal balls in the car." The reader and the audience can't help but laugh when they think of the scene of Beijing workers making coal balls with sieves.

Some people have a contemptuous attitude towards the kuaiban which is rich in mass character, but the performance effect of "Qinghai is Good" shows that such an attitude is wrong. The unanimous warm welcome from the audience and the touching power of the work show that this creation is a good work that has been improved on the basis of popularization. Praising the new things that are growing in the new society, and using the tragic scenes of the old society as a foil, is a good writing technique that will fill the audience with confidence and joy about the present and the future, and cast contemptuous ridicule on the past. No wonder one audience member said: "This program is best performed for graduating students assigned to work in Qinghai, and it will serve as a mobilization report."

"Night Stroll in the Thousand-Mu Field" is a new work by Sun Laikui, a Hebei Xihe Dagu performer. In 1958, he participated in the performance with his own "Five Thousand One," which wrote about the progressive and conservative struggle in wheat production, and won praise. He has written many works, and the "Night Stroll in the Thousand-Mu Field" performed this time is also one of his good works. The work reflects that in the work of moving graves in the people's commune to develop thousand-mu high-yield wheat fields, Wang Lao Han, who had feudal ideas, was encountered, and an ideological struggle between father and son was launched. Wang Lao Han deliberately did not go to see the high-yield fields, but his old habit of loving crops forced him to secretly go to see them at night, and he happened to meet his son and his son's lover sitting on the stone slab in front of the ancestral tomb, which gave him a great stimulus, and finally he changed his mind. The Party branch of the commune insisted on taking the socialist and communist road, improving production with struggle and steps, giving play to the superiority of the commune, and overcoming difficulties one by one before achieving victory. "Night Stroll in the Thousand-Mu Field" specifically raises the difficulties encountered in the commune's development of thousand-mu high-yield fields, and vividly and interestingly describes the process of solving the problems. Performing this work in rural areas is a very good education for farmers. In order to create, the author Sun Laikui went to the People's Commune in Anguo County three times to work, experience life, write, and perform while working, which played a great role in publicity and mobilization for production. Because the author went deep into life, accumulated materials, and listened to the opinions of the masses, he wrote this work. Quyi workers should learn from him and catch up with him. In this way, not only will Quyi creation prosper, but it will also have a promoting effect on agricultural production.

Among the crosstalk works, "Yesterday" is relatively prominent. The story of this work is about a rickshaw driver who was forced by creditors and persecuted by reactionary military police in the old society. He couldn't make a living, and he went crazy when liberation was approaching; he lived in a mental hospital for nearly ten years before he was cured and came out, suddenly like a dream, and his consciousness was still yesterday. He still uses yesterday's point of view to look at the new things that have appeared in the past ten years, which will naturally produce a lot of jokes. The work vividly illustrates that in just ten short years, the new face of new China has become unrecognizable. From National Day in 1958 to National Day in 1959, only one year later, people who left Beijing could no longer recognize Tiananmen Square when they returned, so the ideological realm written by the author is real. This work is not only ideologically high, but also artistically strong. It uses the traditional crosstalk technique of "burden" to give the audience a lot of jokes, and these "burdens" are developed from the things themselves, not "burdens" taken from the side that are unrelated to the theme. The artistic technique of this work is extracted by the author from the development of things. It cannot be found in traditional crosstalk works. It not only exposes the old society and praises the new society, but also reveals that crosstalk creation should find "burdens" or jokes from the contradictions of things themselves, and should not leave the theme to find cheap gimmicks.

The above are just a few examples. There are many good works in this report-back performance, such as the Qingyin lyrics "Jiang Zhuyun," the Tanci "Xiang Xiuli," and the Beijing Rhyme Drum "Party's Daughter Xu Xuehui," which write about communist morals, the Shandong Kuaishu "Old General Giving Up the Car," which writes about the People's Liberation Army, and the Diaoquzi "Good Aunt," which writes about enthusiastically serving the people, are all popular with the masses after these programs are performed.

The traditional programs performed this time have all been reorganized. Although the audience was limited by language, they warmly welcomed the Pingtan "Old Landlord." "Old Landlord" was originally a section of "Describing the Golden Phoenix," and it was reorganized and used as a medium-length piece, which can be sung and said separately. Generally, works about unjust cases have to write about upright officials and high-ranking officials, but this work writes about the old landlord as a chivalrous man who is willing to do what is right, who can redress the unjust case. In the original work, the characters are not prominent enough, and it is very reasonable to highlight this character after reorganization, which is a good example for reorganization work.

Quyi works are written for singing and speaking. In the practice of singing and speaking, the original works can also be modified and enriched. Therefore, a good Quyi work needs a good performance to vividly convey the content and achieve artistic effects. The Quyi performance art in this report-back performance has also been significantly improved compared to a year ago. First of all, the Quyi actors have a deeper understanding of the ideological content of the works. For example, Liang Xiaolou, an old Beijing Rhyme Drum artist, broke her old set of performance methods such as "Li Kui Capturing Fish" in the past when she performed "Party's Daughter Xu Xuehui," and realized Xu Xuehui's communist style of not being afraid of vicious enemies, bravely struggling to protect national property. In order to perform this piece, she listened to Xu Xuehui's report and was moved by Xu Xuehui's behavior, so she did not use the old gestures and singing styles to perform this brand-new character; instead, after careful consideration, she created some new gestures and singing styles, turning the Beijing Rhyme Drum into a Quyi form that promotes new people and new events and uses the past for the present, giving it new vitality. Take the Shandong Kuaishu "Fierce Battle in the Sky" performed by Gao Yuanjun and Liu Hongbin as an example: it is difficult to perform air battles on the stage, and it is not without difficulty to perform air battles in movies; it goes without saying that it is even more difficult to perform with Quyi singing and speaking. Performing air battles with Quyi cannot be found in traditional art, and there is a lack of reference materials in new art. Everything must be created by oneself. In the performance of "Fierce Battle in the Sky," the audience felt the atmosphere of the air battle and was infected by the tense emotions of our plane tailing the enemy plane and destroying the enemy plane, and the joyous mood of the victory of the battle. This performance gave us great enlightenment, that is to say, in addition to accepting the limited traditional art that can be used, Quyi performance must go to real life to find and experience, process and apply. Real life is rich and colorful, and our Quyi performance art will have unlimited bright prospects.

In terms of performance art, the common good phenomenon in the report-back performance is that the musicality of the programs has been strengthened, string music has been added to those without string music accompaniment, and the number of instruments with string music accompaniment has also been increased. Some have also added wind instruments. These additions of instruments are relatively appropriate, and most of them have not destroyed the original musical characteristics of the Quyi genre. There have also been improvements and creations in music. Old artists have changed the original singing styles and added new tunes according to the content. For example, "Plum Blossom Drum" is known to be not easy to express new content. However, "Luo Changxiu" and "Moonlit Night Rowing a Mud Boat" reformed the music and expressed new content, which sounds very good. The same is true for Sichuan "Qingyin." It is especially worth noting that a new group of young actors has increased the appeal of many programs with their natural and beautiful timbres. In short, from this report-back performance, it can be seen that Quyi performance art has taken a big step forward. Another gratifying phenomenon in this report-back performance is that young actors account for the majority, among which Young Pioneer students can be listed as a platoon. They were all trained under the care of the Party after liberation. Some have only studied for two years and have achieved remarkable results, and some have only studied for two or three months and can perform on stage. Even among the accompanying actors, there are many who have been on stage after studying art for one or two years. This fact powerfully refutes the fallacy that Quyi has no successors. Today is only the budding period of new forces. We believe that in the near future, Quyi will bloom more brilliantly.

Of course, this report-back performance is not without shortcomings and problems. For example, there are still some naturalistic things in some works. In terms of performance, there are still individual cases of pursuing vulgar gimmicks. However, these shortcomings will be quickly corrected after discussion and recognition. In addition, such as some works are not high in ideological and artistic quality, and the performance art of some programs lacks creativity, etc. We believe that through research and discussion, and further innovation and improvement, Quyi art will be able to better serve socialist construction.

    曲艺艺术的新面貌
    陶钝
    从1958年8月召开曲艺工作者代表大会和举行第一届全国曲艺会演到现在，已经有一年零四个月了。在这一年多的时间里，我们的社会主义建设事业，在党的社会主义总路线照耀下，正以飞跃的速度向前发展。随着工农业生产和文化艺术事业的跃进，曲艺工作也在跃进。这次文化部举办的曲艺优秀节目汇报演出，就是曲艺跃进的成绩在首都的展览和交流。
    参加这次汇报演出的是一部分省、市和一部分曲艺团体演员所演出的，包括二十五个曲种的七十五个节目。这些节目有80％是现代题材。它们唱的是大炼钢铁和人民公社的新人新事，工农业生产和服务行业的英雄，红军长征的故事，为党为人民牺牲的烈士。总之绝大多数是歌颂人民创造的业绩的。有的也暴露了美帝国主义和蒋介石集团的狼狈相。这里，我只举几篇各类的作品来作简单的介绍。
    快板（数来宝）是曲艺中比较简单，也是群众性比较广的形式。快板“青海好”写得生动活泼。作品的主题是要把被内地群众误解为荒僻之地的青海省作一个正确的介绍。作者运用新旧对比的手法，把旧日马步芳统治下的青海，和今天人民当家作主后的青海作了鲜明的对比；同时，还运用了形象化的语言，把青海的自然环境生动地描绘了一番，然后把今天在党领导下的青海的飞跃的建设作了热情的歌颂。作者随时把旧日青海的悲惨相插入，顺理成章地出了噱头。作品中关于青海产硼砂的描写很生动。说旧日的情况是：“这么多的硼砂不过问，英国人偷着往外运。自己的宝藏不开采，用着了再向英国买。硼砂从西藏偷运走，再从香港来进口；偷了东西还吹大气，说硼砂出在英吉利。”
    这个作品对青海过去的交通描写得也非常形象：“汽车一走乱摇头，人在车里摇煤球。”读者、听众一想到北京工人在用筛子制煤球的情形，不由得发笑。
    对于富有群众性的快板有人存在着轻视的态度，但“青海好”的演出效果却说明这样的态度是不对的。观众的一致热烈欢迎和作品的感人力量，说明了这个创作是一个从普及的基础上提高了的好作品。歌颂新社会正在生长的新事物，拿旧社会的悲惨景象作陪衬，是一种好的写作手法，它将使听众对现在和将来充满了信心和喜悦，对过去投出鄙弃的嘲笑。无怪一个听众这样说：“这个节目最好对分配到青海工作的毕业学生演唱，会起一篇动员报告的作用。”
    “夜逛千亩田”是河北西河大鼓演员孙来奎的新作。1958年他以自己写的小麦丰产中的进步和保守斗争的“五千一”参加会演，博得了好评。他写过很多的作品，这次演出的“夜逛千亩田”也是他的好作品之一。作品反映了在人民公社大搞千亩小麦丰产田的迁坟工作中，遇到了有封建思想的王老汉的阻拦，展开了父子之间的思想斗争。王老汉故意不去看丰产田，但是爱庄稼的老习惯迫使着他夜里偷偷地去看，恰好又遇到儿子和儿子的爱人坐在祖茔前的石板上谈话，给了他很大的刺激，最后终于转变了。公社党支部坚持走社会主义、共产主义的道路，有斗争、有步骤地提高生产，发挥公社的优越性，把困难一个个地克服后才达到胜利。“夜逛千亩田”具体地提出了公社搞千亩丰产田所遇到的困难，又生动多趣地描写了解决问题的过程。这个作品在农村中演出对农民是很好的教育。作者孙来奎为了创作，三次到安国县人民公社里去劳动，体验生活，边劳动、边写作、边演唱，对生产起了很大的宣传鼓动作用。由于作者深入了生活，积累了材料，听取了群众的意见，才写出了这篇作品来。曲艺工作者应当学习他，赶上他。这样，不仅会繁荣曲艺创作，也会对农业生产有推动作用。
    在相声作品中比较突出的是“昨天”。这个作品的故事是写一个三轮车夫在旧社会受到的债主的逼迫，和反动军警的迫害，实在生活不下去，临解放的时候疯了；他在精神病院里住了将近十年才医治好出来，恍然一梦，意识中还是昨天。对于十年来出现的新事物，他还是用昨天的观点来看，自然会产生很多的笑料。作品生动地说明了只是短短的十年，新中国的新面貌已经不能辨识了。从1958年国庆到1959年国庆只一年，离开北京的人再到天安门前已经不能辨认，所以作者所写的思想境界是真实的。这个作品不仅思想性高，艺术性也是很强的。它运用了相声的传统技巧“包袱儿”给听众很多的笑料，而且这些“包袱儿”又是从事物本身发展的，不是从旁边取来的无关主题的“包袱儿”。这个作品的艺术技巧是作者从事物的发展中提炼出来的，在传统的相声作品中是找不到的。它不仅暴露了旧社会，歌颂了新社会，并且揭示了相声创作应当是从事物本身的矛盾中找“包袱儿”或笑料，不应该离开主题去找廉价的噱头。
    以上所举只是很少的几个例子，这次汇报演出中的好作品很多，如写共产主义品德的清音唱词“江竹筠”、弹词“向秀丽”、京韵大鼓“党的女儿徐学惠”，写解放军的山东快书“老将军让车”，写热情为人民服务的大调曲子“好阿姨”等都是，这些节目表演以后都受到群众的欢迎。
    这次演出的传统节目都经过了整理。观众虽然受了语言的限制，但对评弹“老地保”还是热烈地欢迎的。“老地保”本来是“描金凤”中的一段，整理出来当作中篇来使用，是能单独说唱的。一般写冤狱的作品，不得不写清官、大官，这个作品却把老地保写成了见义勇为的侠士，能使冤狱平反。在原著中人物不够突出，经过整理把这个人物突出来是很合理的，给整理工作作了好的范例。
    曲艺作品写出来是供说唱的，在说唱实践中也可以修改和丰富原来的作品。所以好的曲艺作品，要有好的表演才能生动地传达内容，收到艺术效果。这次汇报演出，在曲艺表演艺术上较之一年以前也有显著的提高。首先是曲艺演员对于作品的思想内容有了较深的体会。例如京韵大鼓老艺人良小楼表演“党的女儿徐学惠”，就打破了她过去表演“李逵夺鱼”等一套老的表演方法，体会了徐学惠不怕凶恶的敌人，勇敢奋斗保护国家资财的共产主义风格。为了表演这段词，她去听了徐学惠的报告，为徐学惠的行为所感动，所以她没有用旧的手势、唱腔来表演这种崭新的人物；而是经过仔细揣摩，创造出一些新的手势和唱腔，把京韵大鼓作了宣传新人新事的、古为今用的曲艺形式，使它获得了新的生机。再以高元钧和刘洪滨表演的山东快书“长空激战”为例：戏剧舞台上表演空战有困难，电影表演空战也不是没有困难；用曲艺的说唱来表演，那就更不用说了。用曲艺表演空战不但在传统艺术中找不到，就是新的艺术中也缺少可参考的材料，一切必须自己创造。在“长空激战”的表演中，使听众感受到了空战的气氛，感染到我机尾追敌机、歼灭敌机的紧张情绪和战斗胜利的欢悦心情。这种表演给了我们很大的启示，那就是说，曲艺表演除了接受有限的、可以使用的传统艺术之外，必须到实际生活中去寻找和体会，加工和运用。实际生活是丰富多采的，我们的曲艺表演艺术将要有无限光明的前途。
    在表演艺术上，汇报演出中普遍出现的好现象是很多的，节目的音乐性加强了，没有弦乐伴奏的加上了弦乐，有弦乐伴奏的乐器也加多了，有的还加上了管乐。这些乐器的加添都是比较适当的，大多数没有破坏曲种原有的音乐特点。音乐方面也有了改进和创作，老艺人根据内容改变原有的唱腔，增添了新腔。例如，“梅花大鼓”素称不容易表达新内容。但是“罗昌秀”和“月夜荡泥船”改革了音乐，表达了新内容，听起来还是很好的。四川“清音”也有同样情况。尤其值得注意的是，新出现的一批青年演员凭借他们天赋的优美的音色，使很多节目增加了感染力。总之，从这次汇报演出，可以看出曲艺表演艺术向前迈进了一大步。这次汇报演出还有一个可喜的现象是青年演员占了多数，其中红领巾学员可以列成一个排。他们都是解放以后在党的关怀下培养出来的。有的仅仅学了两年就有了斐然可观的成绩，有的只学了两三个月就能登台演唱，就是伴奏的演员中也有不少是学艺一两年就上台的。这一事实有力地反击了曲艺后继无人的谬论。今天还只是新生力量的发芽时期，我们相信不久的将来，曲艺一定会开出更灿烂的花朵。
    当然，这次汇报演出也不是没有缺点和问题的。例如有的作品中还有些自然主义的东西。在表演上，也还存在着追求庸俗噱头的个别情况。但这些缺点经过讨论和认识，一定会迅速改正的。此外，如有的作品思想性艺术性还不高，有些节目的表演艺术缺乏创造等等。我们相信，通过研究讨论，进一步地加以革新和提高，曲艺艺术一定能够更好地为社会主义建设服务。
