Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 24th - The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published commentaries yesterday and today, exposing the imperialist aims of Eisenhower's trip to Latin America.

The commentaries pointed out that the purpose of Eisenhower's visit to Latin America was to deceive and threaten Latin American countries, to make them continue to submit to the United States. The commentaries said that the U.S. authorities are trying to frighten the timid with bombing and intimidation. However, the current era has changed, and "Latin America is no longer a place where the United States can do as it pleases." "Taking the Cuban revolution as an example, the people of Latin America are bravely fighting for true political and economic independence."

The commentaries stated that the political and economic control of Latin American countries by the United States has proven that the relationship between U.S. imperialism and the people of Latin American countries is an unequal one. The newspaper said that this is the reason why the contradiction between the people of Latin American countries and the U.S. imperialists is becoming increasingly acute.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 24th - "Democratic Korea" published a commentary today, exposing the deceptive remarks made by Eisenhower before visiting Latin America. The commentary said that when Eisenhower traveled to Latin America, he attempted to use the term "decent" to whitewash the bloody colonialist record of crimes and conceal the true face of the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression. Eisenhower said that the United States had not annexed an acre of new land. However, the U.S. invading army is forcibly occupying South Korea and creating all kinds of atrocities there. The commentary said that the U.S. troops must immediately get out of South Korea, and we can no longer tolerate the U.S. wolves creating a bloody record of crimes on our land.

Xinhua News Agency, 24th - Newspapers in Hungary and Czechoslovakia have successively published articles commenting on U.S. President Eisenhower's trip to South America.

The Hungarian "People's Voice" pointed out in a commentary today that Eisenhower's trip to South America will not achieve any results. The bankrupt "big stick and dollar diplomacy" policy cannot be promoted by simply patting shoulders or putting on a few smiles. Eisenhower's sweet words will absolutely not reverse the situation in Latin America.

The newspaper said that U.S. imperialism not only carries out brutal economic aggression and plunder against Latin America but also builds military bases everywhere for military intervention. The people of Latin American countries are full of resentment towards U.S. imperialism and demand that U.S. imperialism get out of Latin America.

The Slovak "Truth" published a commentary on the 23rd, saying that the purpose of Eisenhower's visit to Latin America is to improve the increasingly declining reputation of the United States, maintain its old positions, and curb strong anti-American sentiment. The newspaper pointed out that this strong anti-American sentiment in Latin America was aroused by the U.S.'s conspiracy against Venezuela and Cuba and the savage plunder of large amounts of resources from Latin American countries by U.S. monopoly capital.

    社会主义国家舆论评艾森豪威尔访问
    美国扭转不了拉丁美洲的形势
    据新华社河内24日电　越南“人民报”昨天和今天连续发表评论，揭露艾森豪威尔拉丁美洲之行的帝国主义目的。
    评论指出，艾森豪威尔拉丁美洲之行的目的，是想欺骗和威胁拉丁美洲各国，要使他们继续屈从美国。评论说，美国当局企图用轰炸和恐吓来吓唬胆小的人。但是，当前时代已经变了，“拉丁美洲已经不再是美国可以作威作福的地方了”。“拉丁美洲人民以古巴革命为榜样，正在勇敢地为争取政治上和经济上真正的独立而斗争。”
    评论说，美国在政治上和经济上对拉丁美洲国家的控制已经证明，美帝国主义同拉丁美洲国家人民之间的关系是不平等的关系。这家报纸说，这就是拉丁美洲各国人民同美帝国主义者之间的矛盾越来越尖锐的原因。
    据新华社平壤24日电　“民主朝鲜报”今天发表评论，揭露艾森豪威尔在访问拉丁美洲前发表的欺骗言论。评论说，艾森豪威尔在到拉丁美洲去旅行的时候，企图用“体面”这个名词来粉饰血腥的殖民主义的罪恶记录，隐蔽美帝国主义侵略政策的真面目。艾森豪威尔说美国没有吞并过一亩新的土地。可是，美国侵略军正强占着南朝鲜，并且在那里制造种种的暴行。评论说，美国军队必须立即从南朝鲜滚出去，我们再也不能容忍美国狼在我国的土地上制造血腥的罪恶的记录。
    据新华社24日讯　匈、捷两国的报纸相继发表文章，评论美国总统艾森豪威尔的南美之行。
    匈牙利“人民之声报”今天在评论中指出，艾森豪威尔的南美之行不会得到什么成果。破产了的“大棒和美元外交”政策，是不可能用拍拍肩膀或装出几下微笑就可以推行下去的。艾森豪威尔的花言巧语也绝对扭转不了拉丁美洲的形势。
    这家报纸说，美帝国主义对拉丁美洲不仅进行残酷的经济侵略和掠夺，而且还到处建筑军事基地进行军事干涉。拉丁美洲各国的人民对美帝国主义充满了愤恨，要求美帝国主义滚出拉丁美洲。
    斯洛伐克“真理报”23日发表评论说，艾森豪威尔到拉丁美洲访问的目的在于提高美国愈来愈低落的声誉，保持旧有的阵地，扼制强烈的反美情绪。这家报纸指出，拉丁美洲这种强烈的反美情绪是美国对委内瑞拉和古巴施展阴谋，美国垄断资本野蛮掠夺拉丁美洲国家大量资源所激起的。
