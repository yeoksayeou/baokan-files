After communization, people of all ethnic groups cooperate, learn from each other, and develop their strengths
All Economic Sectors in the Oroqen Autonomous Banner Flourish

(Our Dispatch) Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line and ethnic policies, the Oroqen hunters in the Oroqen Autonomous Banner, Inner Mongolia, have made a great leap forward, and in the spring of 1959, they all joined the people's communes. Thus, the Oroqen ethnic group has stepped into socialist society. In the early days of liberation, the Oroqen brothers were still in a primitive state, with a basically single hunting economy.

The people's communes in the Oroqen Autonomous Banner are all multi-ethnic joint cooperatives, composed of Oroqen, Han, Daur, and Ewenki ethnic groups. After the establishment of the communes, members of all ethnic groups learned from each other's strengths, cooperated, and promoted the common development of various economic sectors. The Han, Daur, Ewenki, and other ethnic group members directly supported the hunters with grain, vegetables, fodder, and vehicles through the communes; the hunters exchanged their hunting products for cash or farm tools to support industry and agriculture. This mutual support led to common prosperity. In 1959, the income from hunting and sideline occupations reached more than 320,000 yuan, an increase of 18.2% over 1958. Moreover, the communes began to implement the policy of combining raising deer and hunting, organizing hunters to carry out deer-hunting campaigns. Some live deer were captured, and two communes have established small deer farms. In the first year after communization, newly emerging agriculture also achieved a bumper harvest. Total grain output increased by 70% compared to 1958, and total vegetable output reached 447,000 jin, basically achieving self-sufficiency in vegetables for hunters.

The development of hunting and agriculture has promoted the development of industry, transportation, and culture and education. In order to meet the needs of the development of hunting and agriculture, each commune established a woodworking factory to manufacture and repair vehicles and agricultural tools. Each commune also established a small leather processing factory to process roe deer skin coats, quilts, gloves, boots, etc. In addition to providing for the members' own use, they also supported the workers in the Greater Khingan Range forest area. Some communes established starch factories due to the abundant harvest of potatoes, processing the potatoes that could not be eaten into vermicelli to support other areas. Each commune has established primary schools, popularizing primary education. With the help of the state, each commune has also established health clinics, supply and marketing cooperatives, meteorological stations, post and telecommunications offices, bank business offices, grain supply stations, and other departments. Some communes have also established wired broadcasting stations.

In 1959, a new town, Alihe, also appeared in the banner. A year ago, this place was still a wilderness, but now it has neat streets, with many brick houses built along the streets. The Party and government leading organs of the Oroqen Autonomous Banner have all moved here. Alihe has also established shops, post offices, banks, broadcasting stations, bathhouses, and installed electric lights and telephones. The telephone can be connected to all parts of the country.

This year, the banner will implement the policy of focusing on forestry and combining raising livestock and hunting, develop industrial and agricultural production in a planned way, and achieve continued leaps forward. This year, the banner will establish large-scale pig farms, each commune will establish small-scale pig farms, and production teams will also run wild animal breeding farms. Cadres and hunters will work together to carry out a large-scale deer-hunting campaign. The banner will support the communes in running two gun and farm tool repair factories and two grain processing factories. The banner will also establish brick and tile factories and lime factories to support basic construction. Agriculture should achieve complete self-sufficiency in vegetables. In order to meet the needs of the rapid development of the commune economy, illiteracy among young and middle-aged people must be basically eliminated in 1960, and middle school classes will be set up in the banner's complete primary schools.

    公社化后各族人民分工合作取长补短
    鄂伦春自治旗各种经济全繁荣
    本报讯　内蒙古鄂伦春自治旗的鄂伦春族猎人，在党的总路线和民族政策的光辉照耀下，飞马跃进，1959年春天全部加入了人民公社。至此，鄂伦春族已跨进社会主义社会。而解放初期，鄂伦春兄弟民族还是带有原始状态的、基本是单一猎业经济的社会。
    鄂伦春自治旗的人民公社，都是多民族的联合社，由鄂伦春、汉、达斡尔、鄂温克等民族组成。公社成立后，各族社员相互取长补短，分工协作，促进各种经济共同发展。汉、达斡尔、鄂温克等族社员，通过公社以粮食、蔬菜、饲料和车辆等直接支援猎人；猎人以猎产品换回现金或农具，支援工、农业。这样互相支援，一齐繁荣，1959年猎副业收入达三十二万多元，比1958年增加18．2％。而且，公社开始贯彻执行养和猎并举方针，组织猎民展开了捕鹿运动，捕到了一部分活鹿，已有两个公社建立了小型养鹿场。公社化后的第一年，新兴的农业也获得了大丰收。粮食总产量比1958年增产70％，蔬菜总产量达四十四万七千斤，猎民的蔬菜已基本自给。
    猎、农业的发展，促进了工业、交通和文教的发展。各公社为了适应猎、农业发展的需要，建立了木工厂，自己制造、修配车辆和农具。各公社还建立了小型皮革加工厂，加工狍皮大衣、被子、手套、靴子等，除了供社员自用外，还支援了大兴安岭林区的职工。有的公社因马铃薯丰收而建立了淀粉厂，把吃不了的马铃薯加工成粉条支援了外地。各公社都建立了小学校，普及了小学教育。在国家帮助下，各公社还建立了卫生所、供销社、气象站、邮电所、银行营业所、粮食供应站等部门。有的公社还建立了有线广播站。
    1959年，这个旗还出现了一座新的城镇——阿里河。一年前，这里还是一片荒地，现在已有了整齐的街道，街旁建起许多砖瓦房。鄂伦春自治旗党政领导机关，都迁到了这里。阿里河还建立了商店、邮局、银行、广播站、澡堂，并装上了电灯电话。电话可通到全国各地。
    今年，这个旗将贯彻执行以林为主，养猎并举的方针，有计划地发展工农牧业生产，实现继续跃进。今年旗里要建立大型养猪场，各社建立小型养猪场，生产队也办野兽养殖场。干部、猎人齐动手，开展大规模的捕鹿运动。旗里要扶助公社办两个枪枝、农具修配厂，两处粮米加工厂。旗里还要建立砖瓦厂、石灰厂，以支援基本建设。农业要做到蔬菜全部自给。为了适应公社经济迅速发展的需要，1960年要基本扫除青壮年文盲，并在旗完小里设立中学班。
