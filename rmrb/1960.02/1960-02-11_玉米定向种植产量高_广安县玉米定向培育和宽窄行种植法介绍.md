    High Maize Yields with Directional Planting
    ——An Introduction to Maize Directional Cultivation and Wide-Narrow Row Planting Method in Guang’an County
    Lǐ Zhèngquán
    Guang'an County is located in northeastern Sichuan, a hilly area with a mild climate. Maize is one of the county's main dryland crops, historically known as "Golden Guang'an." In 1959, the county planted 50,000 mu of early maize, averaging 1,028 jin per mu, plus over 80,000 mu of intercropped medium-maturity maize, averaging 733 jin per mu, a 128% increase compared to the average yield of 320 jin per mu during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The continuous innovation of cultivation techniques by Guang'an County farmers is one of the important reasons for the bumper maize harvest last year. Among them, maize directional cultivation and wide-narrow row planting method, although basically still in the experimental stage, the fact of high yield has proved that it is an important measure to improve the unit yield of maize.
    Maize directional cultivation and wide-narrow row planting method can further improve planting density, ensuring more plants per mu, more ears, larger ears, heavier grains, and higher yields. It breaks the assertion that maize is a tall-stalk crop with ears growing in the middle of the stalks, unlike crops such as rice and wheat, and cannot be densely planted; it also breaks the limit that tall-stalk, late-maturing varieties should not exceed 3,000 plants per mu, and general medium-stalk, medium-maturity varieties should not exceed 4,000 plants per mu. In 1959, the county's maize planting density was increased to 4,000-5,000 plants per mu over a large area, and 5,000-6,000 plants per mu in high-yield fields. Due to the increased planting density, the masses created methods suitable for dense planting—directional cultivation and wide-narrow row planting.
    Directional cultivation makes full use of the natural opposite arrangement of maize leaves. Through artificial cultivation, the leaves grow in a certain direction, which is conducive to ventilation and light transmission, and can shorten row and plant spacing, increase the total number of plants per unit area, and further unleash the growth potential of maize. According to our investigation in Taishan People's Commune in 1959, under the same cultivation conditions, nine mu using the local Golden Maize variety with directional cultivation planted 6,240 plants per mu. Among them, 80% of the plants adopted artificial seedling transplantation for directional cultivation, averaging 1,204 jin per mu; another 3.6 mu, with 6,124 plants per mu, 40% underwent seedling thinning for directional cultivation, yielding 1,109 jin per mu. A one-mu experimental plot of the Huoqiao District Committee, planted with "Sichuan Agricultural 56-1" maize, had 4,825 plants per mu, of which more than 90% adopted artificial placement and sowing, and seedling thinning for directional cultivation, yielding 1,081 jin per mu, a 57% increase compared to the 1.5 mu of the same variety without directional cultivation.
    The masses believe that directional dense planting has three major benefits: (1) it can solve the problem of ventilation and light transmission after dense planting, increase the number of plants per unit area, and increase yield; (2) it shortens plant spacing and appropriately widens row spacing, facilitating field management; (3) after maize is oriented, the leaves will not cross each other and cover the female flowers, affecting pollination.
    How can maize directional growth be achieved? After the full promotion of directional dense planting technology in 1959, we have initially explored some solutions: (1) Appropriately increase the amount of seeds used. When the seedlings emerge and the direction of the leaves can be identified, thin out the non-directional and weak seedlings to achieve full directional growth, full seedlings, and strong seedlings, killing two birds with one stone. In 1959, the county increased the amount of seeds used per mu from about five jin in the past to ten jin. (2) Use seedling transplanting tools to transplant seedlings. When the seedlings are about three inches high, transplant them for directional cultivation within the original hole. It is best to choose a sunny day after rain, or a sunny day after watering to moisten the soil before transplanting seedlings for directional cultivation. The county party committee promoted the bamboo seedling transplanting tool created by Communist Party member Zhang Peizhong and others from Dalian People's Commune (each finished product only costs a few cents), and each person can orient four to six mu per day. (3) Some high-yield areas also adopt square grid seedling raising similar to the nutrient pots used for cotton seedlings. After the seedlings emerge, they are immediately transplanted with soil for directional cultivation. However, this method requires more labor. If on-site seedling raising, early seedling raising, and early transplanting are adopted, staggering the seasons can avoid labor shortages.
    In 1959, the county promoted the wide-narrow row planting method on the basis of maize dense planting, so that the densely planted maize could get a better ventilation and light transmission environment. According to the plant type of the variety, we adopted three planting forms: (1) Wide rows are two feet five inches, narrow rows are one foot five inches, average row spacing is two feet (the same below), hole spacing is one foot two inches, with two seedlings left per hole, plus the edge rows can increase the number of plants, planting about 5,000 plants per mu. This method is suitable for planting local fine varieties, medium-sized Golden Maize. (2) Wide rows are three feet, narrow rows are two feet, hole spacing is six inches, with one plant per hole, planting about 4,000 plants per mu. This method is suitable for planting tall varieties such as Golden Queen and White Guide. (3) Wide rows are two feet two inches, narrow rows are one foot eight inches, hole spacing is one foot, with two plants per hole, planting about 6,000 plants per mu. This method is suitable for early-maturing, small-sized varieties such as Erban Early and Qipiye.
    According to our investigation in Yongxing First Brigade, the effect of the above planting methods is that the yield increase is not significant for wide-narrow row planting with less than 4,000 plants per mu; the yield increase is very large for planting more than 4,000 plants per mu. Wide-narrow row planting with 4,670 plants per mu has better ventilation and light transmission conditions than equal row planting, the ears are 1.5 cm longer, the ears increase by 2.8 grams, lodging is reduced by 17%, and the yield per mu increases by 24%. For planting 3,750 plants per mu, the yield difference between wide-narrow row and equal row planting methods is only 0.6%. This fact shows that as the degree of maize dense planting increases, the planting method is also a problem worth studying. The wide-narrow row planting method is worth further research and exploration in the future.
    While implementing wide-narrow row planting, it must be combined with directional planting, north-south ridge opening and east-west sowing, and staggered hole planting to give greater play to the yield-increasing effect of maize dense planting.

    玉米定向种植产量高
    ——广安县玉米定向培育和宽窄行种植法介绍
    李正泉
    广安县位于四川东北部，地属丘陵，气候温和。玉米是全县旱地主要作物之一，历史上享有“金广安”之称。1959年全县种植早玉米五万亩，平均亩产一千零二十八斤，加上套作的中熟玉米八万多亩，平均亩产七百三十三斤，比特大跃进的1958年平均亩产三百二十斤增产128％。广安县农民不断的革新耕作技术，是去年获得玉米大丰收的重要原因之一。其中玉米的定向培育和宽窄行种植法，虽然基本上还在试验阶段，但丰产的事实已经证明了它是提高玉米单位产量的一项重要的措施。
    玉米定向培育和宽窄行种植法，可以进一步提高密植程度，保证每亩株多、穗多、穗大、籽重、产量高。它打破了人们认为玉米是高秆作物，果穗着生在茎秆中部，不同于稻、麦等作物，不能密植的论断；它还打破了茎秆高大晚熟种的作物，每亩不超过三千株，一般茎秆中等的中熟种不超过亩植四千株的极限。1959年，全县玉米大面积种植密度提高到每亩四、五千株，高产田每亩五、六千株。由于密植程度增加，群众便创造了适宜于密植的方法——定向培育和宽窄行种植法。
    定向培育是充分利用玉米叶子自然对生的特性，经过人为的培植，达到玉米的叶子向一定方向生长，植株便于通风透光，可以缩短行、株距，增加单位面积上的总株数，进一步发挥玉米生长潜力。根据我们1959年在太山人民公社调查，在同等耕作条件下，选用本地金黄玉米良种定向培育的九亩，亩植六千二百四十株。其中采用人工移苗定向的植株达80％，平均亩产一千二百零四斤；另外三点六亩，每亩植六千一百二十四株，40％经过匀苗定向，亩产一千一百零九斤。花桥区委一亩试验地，种“川农56—1”玉米，每亩四千八百二十五株，其中采用人工摆播与播种，匀苗定向的占90％以上，亩产一千零八十一斤，比未定向的同一品种的一点五亩增产57％。
    群众认为定向密植有三大好处：（一）能解决密植以后通风透光问题，增加单位面积的株数，提高产量；（二）缩短株距，适当放宽了行距，便于田间管理；（三）玉米定向以后不致因叶子交叉，相互遮盖雌花，影响授粉。
    如何才能达到玉米定向生长？1959年全面推广了定向密植技术之后，我们初步摸索出了一些解决的办法：（1）适当增加用种量，待苗出土能识别叶子的方向时，匀去不定向及病弱小苗，达到全部定向，全苗壮苗，一举两得。全县1959年每亩地用种量由过去五斤左右，增加到十斤。（2）使用移苗器移苗。当苗高三寸左右时，在原穴内进行移苗定向。移苗时最好选择雨后晴天，或晴天浇水湿润土壤后进行移苗定向。县委推广了大良人民公社共产党员张培中等同志创造的竹制移苗器（每个成品只花几分钱），每人每日能定向四到六亩。（3）部分丰产地还采用方格育苗与培育棉苗的营养钵相类似，待苗出土后，立即带土移苗，定向栽培。但这种办法花工较多。如采用就地育苗，提早育苗，提早移栽，错开季节，可以避免劳力紧张。
    1959年，全县在玉米密植的基础上，推广了宽窄行种植方法，使密植的玉米得到更加良好的通风透光的环境。我们根据品种株型，采用了三种种植形式：（1）宽行二尺五寸，窄行一尺五寸，平均行距二尺，穴距一尺二寸（以下同），每穴留苗双株，加上边行可以增加株数，亩植五千株左右。这种方法适宜于种植本地良种、株型中等的金黄玉米。（2）宽行三尺，窄行二尺，穴距六寸，每穴单株，亩植四千株左右。这种方法适宜于种植金皇后、白导方等株型高大的品种。（3）宽行二尺二寸，窄行一尺八寸，穴距一尺，每穴双株，亩植六千株左右。这种方法适宜早熟、株型矮小的二坂早、七匹叶等。
    上述种植方法的效果，根据我们在永兴第一大队调查，宽窄行每亩种植四千株以下的，增产效果不显著；亩种四千株以上的，增产幅度就很大。采用宽窄行每亩种四千六百七十株的，比等行播种的通风透光条件良好，果穗长一点五厘米，果穗增加二点八克，倒伏减轻17％，亩产增加24％。每亩种植三千七百五十株的，采用宽窄行与等行播种方式，产量仅相差0．6％。这个事实说明：随着玉米密植程度的增加，种植方法也是很值得研究的问题。宽窄行种植法值得今后进一步研究探讨。
    在推行宽窄行种植的同时，必须与定向种植、南北开厢东西播种、错穴种植相结合，以发挥玉米密植更大的增产作用。
