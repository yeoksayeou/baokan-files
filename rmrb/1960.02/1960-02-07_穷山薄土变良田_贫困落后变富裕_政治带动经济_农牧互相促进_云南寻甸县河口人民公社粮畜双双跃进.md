This newspaper reports: The River Mouth People's Commune in Xundian County, Yunnan Province, is a commune with ten thousand pigs, ten thousand cattle, and ten thousand sheep. This commune, by adhering to the principle of putting politics in command and implementing the policy of giving equal importance to grain and livestock, and by vigorously developing animal husbandry such as pigs, cattle, and sheep while vigorously developing agriculture, has greatly developed animal husbandry, thereby greatly increasing the income of its members, improving their lives, saving a large amount of labor, and promoting a bumper harvest in agricultural production.

The River Mouth People's Commune has more than 4,000 households and is a semi-mountainous area inhabited by various ethnic groups such as Han, Hui, Yi, and Miao. In the past, the land was barren and the people lived in poverty. Due to the implementation of the Party's policy of vigorously developing animal husbandry, the commune now has more than 11,000 pigs, an increase of more than 40% compared with 1958; more than 12,000 head of cattle, an increase of 14%; and more than 14,000 sheep, an increase of 50%. Due to the great development of livestock, more than one million dan of farmyard manure were accumulated last year, with an average application of more than 70 dan of this excellent fertilizer per mu. In many barren management areas such as Baishiyan, Shizaozi, and Samiluo, more than 100 dan of farmyard manure were applied per mu of land. When plowing, the ground was generally covered with a layer of farmyard manure more than one inch deep. In some fields, it was necessary to dig about two inches deep to see the soil layer. Therefore, the entire commune achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest of grain last year. The average yield of rice per mu increased from 225 jin to more than 500 jin; the average yield of corn per mu increased from 250 jin to more than 500 jin, both increasing by more than one time. The total grain output increased sharply from more than 24 million jin in 1958 to more than 39 million jin, with an average of more than 1,700 jin of grain per person. Last year, after completing the tasks of public grain and surplus grain, and leaving enough grain and seeds, the total reserve grain of the commune this year was 6.14 million jin, with an average of 267 jin of reserve grain per person, which can feed all members for more than eight months. The reserve grain left by the Baishiyan management area can feed the members for two years.

The great development of animal husbandry has not only supported national construction but also greatly increased the commune's accumulation and improved the lives of its members. From January of last year to the present, the entire commune has sold more than 3,000 head of livestock and a large number of animal products to the state. Among them, there were more than 1,600 fat pigs and more than 1,100 head of cattle, more than double the amount in 1958. Last year, the entire commune sold 3 million jin of surplus grain, earning 150,000 yuan, while the income from selling livestock and animal products and using animal power for short-distance transportation reached more than 247,000 yuan, accounting for half of the total cash income for the year. The total amount of wages paid to the members reached more than 290,000 yuan, with an average increase of more than 50% in the income of each laborer. At the same time, more than 90,000 yuan was allocated for capital construction, purchasing a large number of new-style farm implements, livestock breeding equipment, and various improved breeds of livestock. Now, the commune also has more than 260,000 yuan in savings deposits, and 90% of the commune's households have savings deposits. The amount of meat consumed by the members has also greatly increased. Due to the consumption of more meat and oil than in previous years, the members are all rosy-cheeked, strong and healthy.

Another huge change brought to the River Mouth Commune by the great development of animal husbandry is the saving of a large amount of agricultural labor. Due to the barren land, the River Mouth Commune has always been characterized by extensive planting and low yields. The entire commune averaged more than eight mu of cultivated land per person, and labor was very tight. However, due to the large increase in livestock, many of the tasks that were originally done by manual labor have been replaced by animal power. The commune has more than 4,000 head of cattle, with an average of two head of cattle per laborer. Due to the large number of cattle in many production teams, four, six, or eight cattle are used in turn to plow the fields every day. A pair of cattle is changed every few hours, which increases the efficiency of plowing by more than one time. Due to the large number of livestock, more than 1,400 carts were built last year, and the experience of one person driving two or three carts was promoted, which also saved a lot of manpower. Calculating on the basis of one livestock animal replacing four laborers, the entire commune saved more than 1.55 million workdays last year, equivalent to an increase of more than 55,000 full laborers, equivalent to more than 80% of the total agricultural labor force. Therefore, although each laborer in the commune averages more than eight mu of cultivated land, they have never felt short of labor since last year. Even during the autumn harvest and planting season, it was possible to transfer more than 700 laborers to build more than 30 kilometers of roads, and every time the production season is the most tense, the commune can actively draw hundreds of laborers and hundreds of head of cattle to support fraternal communes.

On the favorable basis of the double leap forward in grain and livestock in 1959, the members of the River Mouth Commune have once again made the ambitious determination to win a greater leap forward this year, determined to break through the 100,000 head of livestock mark this year, and expand the cultivated area by another 75%, reclaiming 40,000 mu of wasteland in one year.

    穷山薄土变良田　贫困落后变富裕
    政治带动经济　农牧互相促进
    云南寻甸县河口人民公社粮畜双双跃进
    本报讯　云南省寻甸县河口人民公社，是一个拥有万猪、万牛、万羊的公社。这个公社由于坚持了政治挂帅，贯彻了粮畜并举、两条腿走路的方针，在大抓农业的同时，又大抓猪、牛、羊等畜业，使畜牧业有了大发展，从而大大增加了社员收入，改善了生活，还节省了大量劳动力，又促进了农业生产的大丰收。
    河口人民公社共有四千多户，是一个汉、回、彝、苗等各民族杂居的半山区，过去土地瘠薄，人民生活穷困。由于执行了党的大力发展畜牧业的方针，这个公社目前已经有猪一万一千多头，比1958年增长40％以上；耕牛一万二千多头，增长了14％；羊一万四千多头，增长了50％。由于牲畜大发展，去年就积了一百多万担厩肥，每亩平均施用这种优良肥料七十多担。白石岩、石糟子、撒米罗等许多贫瘠的管理区，每亩田地施厩肥都在一百担以上。犁田时，普遍在地面铺上一寸多深的厩肥。有些地里挖开约两寸深，才能看见土层。因此，全社去年粮食获得了全面大丰收，水稻每亩平均产量由二百二十五斤增加到五百多斤；包谷平均亩产由二百五十斤提高到五百多斤，都增产一倍以上，粮食总产量由1958年的二千四百多万斤猛升到三千九百多万斤，平均每人有粮一千七百多斤。去年，除完成公粮、余粮任务，留足口粮、种籽外，全社今年的储备粮共六百十四万斤，平均每人有储备粮二百六十七斤，可供全体社员吃八个多月。白石岩管理区所留的储备粮，可以供社员吃两年。
    畜牧业的大发展，不但支援了国家建设，而且大大增加公社积累和改善社员生活。从去年1月到目前为止，全社共售给国家三千多头牲畜和大量的畜产品。其中有肥猪一千六百多头，黄牛一千一百多头，较1958年增加一倍多。全社去年出售了三百万斤余粮，收入十五万元，而出售牲畜和畜产品以及使用畜力从事短途运输的收入就达到二十四万七千多元，占全年现金总收入的一半。给社员发的工资总额达二十九万多元，每个劳力的收入平均增长50％以上。同时还拨出九万多元从事基本建设，购买大批新式农具、牲畜配种器械和各种良种畜。现在，公社还存款二十六万多元，全社90％农户都有了存款。社员们吃肉的数量也大有增加。由于食用肉类、油类比往年多，社员们都红光满面，身强力壮。
    畜牧业大发展给河口公社带来的另一个巨大变化，是节省了大量的农业劳动力，河口公社由于土地贫瘠，一向广种薄收，全社平均每人负担八亩多耕地，劳力十分紧张。但是，由于牲畜的大量增加，许多原来用人力干的活计，都已经被畜力所代替。这个公社有耕牛四千多头，平均一个劳动力有两头耕牛。许多生产队由于牛多，每天一个犁头使用四条、六条、八条牛轮番犁地。几小时就换一双牛，使耕田的效率提高到一倍以上。由于牲畜多，去年又造了一千四百多辆牛马车，推广了一人赶两辆、三辆牛车的经验，也节省了不少人力。以一个牲畜顶四个劳力计算，全社去年就节省了一百五十五万多劳动日，等于增加了五万五千多个全劳动力，相当于全部农业劳动力的80％多。因此这个公社虽然每个劳力平均负担八亩多耕地，但去年以来，从未感到劳力紧张。甚至在秋收秋种时，还可能抽调七百多个劳动力兴修三十多公里的公路，而且每逢生产最紧张的季节，这个公社都能主动抽出几百个劳力，几百条耕牛支援各兄弟公社。
    在1959年粮畜双跃进的有利基础上，河口公社社员们今年又立下了夺取更大跃进的雄心壮志，决心今年突破十万头牲畜的大关，耕地面积再扩大75％，一年开荒四万亩。
