　　Manxita

　　A Pace-Setter on Qinghai's Animal Husbandry Front

　　By Our Staff Reporter Zhao Huaiqing

Manxita is an outstanding herdsman from the Sujitan Commune in Menyuan Hui Autonomous County, Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province. Last year, after returning from the National Day celebrations in Beijing, which marked the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, he arrived at the commune late in the evening, weary from his journey. However, he bypassed his own home and went straight to the sheepfold. Gazing intently at the flock of sheep he had been separated from for over a month, he felt as if the thousand ewes before him had doubled or tripled in number. At that moment, he resolved that in 1960, he would ensure that each ewe produced two lambs, far surpassing the record he had set in 1959, where 700 ewes of breeding age had a survival rate of 108.7%.

Now is the peak season for lambing. Every day, as the morning sun crests the mountains, Manxita's productive flock of sheep moves along the undulating slopes, line after line, like pearls rolling across the golden grasslands. The ewes are robust and gleam with a dazzling sheen; the lambs burrow under their mothers, wagging their tails, suckling and frolicking. Speaking of their condition this year, it can be described as unprecedented in a thousand years. The saying "Autumn fat, winter thin, spring death" has plagued herdsmen for years, but this phenomenon no longer exists. Even though it is the winter lambing season, every sheep is in top condition, no wonder the veteran herdsmen are full of praise!

A ewe, straying from the flock, would sometimes lie down, sometimes paw the ground. Manxita's eyes flashed with anxiety, but he finally heard a soft bleating sound. He gently approached and, like a careful obstetrician, disinfected and fed the lamb. However, the ewe remained squatting beside him, clearly in pain. Manxita stroked the ewe, thinking, "Is it sick?" When he suddenly saw another lamb being born, a surge of joy and excitement welled up in his heart. He didn't even bother to wipe the amniotic fluid off the lambs, but scooped them up, one in each arm, as if a child had accomplished something remarkable, his face beaming like a flower. "Ah, twins, another set of twins! One older brother, one younger brother!" Once, while he was grazing the sheep on the hillside, an eagle swooped down from behind the mountain, snatching a lamb like a gust of wind. Manxita had just recovered from an illness and was feeling weak, but he didn't hesitate. He threw off his leather robe and gave chase. The mountain path was uneven, and he stumbled along, three miles out, before collapsing to the ground. He saw the eagle perched leisurely on the hilltop, clutching the lamb. A strong sense of responsibility spurred him on, and he struggled to his feet and climbed the hill, angrily hurling a rock at the eagle, which was about to devour the lamb. The eagle dropped the lamb in a panic and flew away. Manxita rushed over and applied medicine to the lamb's wound. Anxious about the flock, he didn't rest, but tucked the lamb into his arms and immediately returned.

Communist Party member Manxita is twenty-three years old this year. He started herding sheep for the herd-owners with his father at the age of eight. In those dark days, the livestock sometimes got good grass, but he lived a life of hunger and cold, covered by the sky. After liberation, he had his own cattle and sheep thanks to the Party's relief efforts. Under the Party's cultivation and education, in 1955, the 30,000 ewes he herded for the mutual aid team had a survival rate of 89%. Due to his selfless labor, he was honored to attend the Youth Activists Conference in Beijing. As if in a dream, the herdsman met our great leader Chairman Mao. He said with tears in his eyes, "Party, the achievements I have made are so insignificant compared to the honor you have given me!" He secretly resolved not to let the Party down! That year, upon his return, he implemented seasonal grazing as instructed by the Party. With the same grassland, the livestock breeding survival rate was greatly improved. In 1958, in the auditorium of the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference, he met the heroes who had achieved a livestock breeding survival rate of over 100%. He wondered if it was because they had better water and grass, and a warmer climate! But he immediately refuted this notion, "No, I am far behind! I must catch up!"

After returning, he accepted the commune Party committee's assignment to manage a high-yield experimental group of 700 ewes of breeding age. It was the Party that encouraged Manxita to set ambitious goals, and it was the Party that gave him the drive and determination to break with convention in animal husbandry production. To achieve high-speed breeding of sheep and realize two births a year, he actively studied artificial insemination techniques. During those days, he knew no fatigue, even sketching diagrams on the ground with a twig while eating, and dreaming of mastering the technique. In the past, the sheep here gave birth only once a year, and even then, not all were pregnant. An old man said to him, "You're crazy, boy! Look, if you can't get the ewe pregnant, you'll just hurt her. In the end, you'll kill the mother and delay the offspring!" Manxita replied, "Grandpa, this is an experience that people have already successfully experimented with!" The old man shook his head like a rattle drum. Manxita said no more, knowing that it couldn't be explained in a few words, and he became even more determined. Together with a few like-minded partners, he built earthen walls and blocked tents, working day and night, overcoming difficulties such as the poor conditions in the pastoral area and the difficulty of preserving semen in the severe winter. Finally, all the ewes were inseminated, and they all gave birth to lambs. However, the sheep were still weak after giving birth and had to be mated again immediately. The winter pasture was withered, and the grazing time was short, which seriously affected fattening and maintaining their condition. What to do? Manxita pondered day and night, and suddenly he thought of the three-shift system in industry and the night battles in agriculture. He had an epiphany: why couldn't there be night grazing in animal husbandry? The Party organization supported his experiment, which later became the "double eight, four" grazing method (eight hours of grazing during the day and eight hours at night, with four hours of rest each) that was promoted throughout the region. Manxita took the lead, watching the flat, grassy pasture during the day and filling in small burrows with tools. At night, he drove the sheep to the pasture in the face of the biting cold. Before long, the brims of his hat and his eyelashes were covered in frost, but he didn't care at all. The lambs were most likely to get lost during night grazing. Manxita kept a close eye on the flock, and no sheep could escape his notice if it fell behind or stopped eating. If a lamb was born and couldn't keep up with the flock, and was also afraid of the cold, he would put it in a lambing bag and carry it on his back, or keep it warm in his arms. The quiet, greedy sound of the sheep eating grass was like a torrential rain falling on the prairie. For a shepherd, what sound could be more pleasing to the ear? The sheep's condition improved day and night, like autumn crops. On the basis of ensuring the sheep's good condition, hot-cycle mating was promoted, and Manxita finally created a high-yield production of 700 ewes with a survival rate of 108.7% last year.

In the face of victory and glory, Manxita is not satisfied with his existing achievements. Whenever he has time, he consults with old herdsmen and begins to summarize his more than ten years of herding experience, recording every detail in a small notebook. He attends literacy classes and amateur animal husbandry and veterinary medicine schools, rain or shine, arriving earliest and leaving latest. He saves money to buy books. The vast and beautiful natural pasture is his ideal classroom. Now he is not only an excellent herdsman, but also an outstanding veterinarian, lambing assistant, and inseminator. The "night grazing" and other grazing methods he has summarized and created, as well as experiences such as "fifteen no's for pregnancy protection" and "twelve preparations for lambing," not only enable his high-yield flock to achieve even greater harvests, but will also surely blossom and bear fruit everywhere on the Qinghai grasslands.

    满西塔
    青海畜牧业战线上的标兵
    本报记者　赵淮青
    满西塔是青海省海北藏族自治州门源回族自治县苏吉滩公社的优秀放牧员。去年他从北京参加建国十周年国庆大典回来，风尘仆仆，到公社时天色已晚，他却绕过了自己的家门，径直来到羊圈。他凝神看着分别了一个多月的羊群，恍惚觉得面前的一千只母羊一倍两倍地增加了。这时他下定决心，在1960年要促使一个母羊产两个羊羔，把1959年创造的七百只适龄母羊繁殖成活率108．7％的纪录远远甩到后边。
    现在正是产羔旺季。每天，当朝阳刚刚漫过山头，满西塔放养的丰产羊群就沿着起伏的山坡走来，一队一队，像珍珠似的滚动在金色的草原上。母羊肥壮，一只只闪着耀眼的光泽；小羊钻进妈妈肚下摇着尾巴，咂奶、撒欢。提起今年的膘情，真算是千年未有的。“秋肥、冬瘦、春死亡”这句话多少年来一直苦恼着牧人们，而现在这种现象已经不存在了。虽是冬季产羔季节，但头头羊都是一等膘，难怪老放牧员们赞不绝口！
    一只落群的母羊，时而卧倒，时而蹬蹄，满西塔的眼睛闪烁着焦急的神情，但他终于听到了一声轻柔的叫声。于是他轻轻地走过去，像一个细心的助产士一样为羊羔消毒、服食。可是，母羊蹲在他身边，痛苦折磨着它。满西塔抚摸着母羊，心里想“是病了吧？”当他猛然看到又一只小羊降生出来时，多少快乐和激动涌上了他的心头。他顾不得把羔儿身上的胎液擦干，一只胳臂抱起一个，如同一个孩子作了一件得意的事情，脸上笑得像朵花。“呵，双羔，又是双羔。一个大哥，一个小弟！”有一次他正在山坡上放羊，忽然，山后俯冲下一只饿鹰，像一阵风吹似的把一只羊羔叼走了。那时满西塔刚刚病好，周身软绵绵的，但他没有迟疑，脱下皮袄就去追赶。山坡小道高低不平，他高一脚低一脚，赶出三里多路，还没到山头就栽倒在地上。他看见那只老鹰叼着羊羔悠然地落在山头，一种强烈的责任心鞭策着他，又挣扎起来爬上了山头，向正要啄食小羊的老鹰愤怒地扔出了一块石头。老鹰在慌乱中丢下羊羔，飞走了。满西塔扑过去，在羊羔的伤口上敷了药。他记挂着羊群，没顾上休息，把羔羊揣在怀里，又马上返回。
    共产党员满西塔，今年二十三岁。他八岁时就跟父亲给牧主放羊，在那些暗无天日的岁月里，牲畜有时还能吃到好草，而他却过着啼饥号寒、盖天铺地的生活。解放后，由于党的救济，才有了自己的牛羊。在党的培养教育下，1955年他为互助组放的三万只母羊，繁殖成活率达到89％。由于他的忘我的劳动，他曾光荣地到北京参加了青年积极分子会议。像在梦境一样，一个放牧员见到了我们各族人民伟大的领袖毛主席。他含着热泪说道：“党呵，我作出的成绩和您给我的荣誉相比，是多么不相称呵！”他暗自下定了决心，不辜负党的培养！那年回来，他就按照党的指示实行了四季轮牧，同样的草原，牲畜繁殖成活率却大大提高了。1958年，在全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的礼堂里，他又会见了促使牲畜繁殖成活率超过百分之百的英雄们。他想，是人家的水草好、气候暖吧！但心里马上反驳了自己这种看法，“不，我已经远远落在后边了！必须迎头赶上！”
    回来后，他接受了公社党委交给的七百只适龄母羊的丰产试验群。是党鼓舞满西塔立下了雄心大志，是党给了他在畜牧业生产上勇于打破陈规的干劲和决心。为了使绵羊高速度繁殖，实现一年两产，他积极学习人工配种技术。在那些日子里，他不知道疲倦，吃饭时还拿根树枝在地上乱划，睡梦也梦见自己学会了技术。过去，这里的羊一年一产还不能满怀。一位老汉对他说：“你这娃疯啦，瞧吧，母羊配不上也给你抓坏了，到头来弄个娘死儿耽搁！”满西塔回答说：“阿爷，这是人家实验成功了的经验呵！”那老头听着，头摇的像货郎鼓一样。满西塔不讲话了，他知道这不是几句话可以解说清楚的，心里更加攒劲，他和几个同心的伙伴一起垒土墙、堵帐房，白天连着黑夜干，克服了牧区条件差、严冬精液不易保存等困难，最后给母羊都配上了种，也都产下了羔。可是，羊刚产后，身体还虚弱，马上就要抓羊热配，而冬季牧草枯黄、吃草时间又短，给抓膘、保膘带来了严重的影响。怎么办呢？满西塔日思夜想，忽然想起工业上的三班制，农业上的夜战，心里一下子开了窍：在畜牧业上为什么不能夜牧呢？党组织支持他试验，这就是后来在各地推广的“双八、四”放牧方法（白天夜晚各放八小时，各休息四小时）。满西塔以身作则，白天放牧时，看好了平坦、草好的草场，带上工具把小洞穴填平。夜里迎着刺骨的寒风，把羊只赶到草场上去放牧。站不多久，帽沿和睫毛上就结满了霜花，他却一点也不在乎。夜牧中最容易丢失羊羔，满西塔时刻盯住羊群，那个掉队了，那个不吃了，全逃不出他的眼睛。小羊刚生下来跟不上群，又怕冷，他就装进接羔袋自己背上，或者揣在怀里暖着。羊群安静、贪婪的吃草声，像滂沱大雨落入草原，对牧羊人来说，世界上还有什么声音比这更好听呢？羊膘日夜增长，像秋天的粮食作物似的。在抓好羊膘的基础上，推行热胎配种，满西塔终于在去年创造了七百只母羊繁殖成活率达到108．7％的高额丰产。
    在胜利和光荣面前，满西塔并不满足于已有的成就。他一有时间就去请教老牧民，并开始总结自己十多年的放牧经验，一点一滴记在小本本上。在扫盲班和畜牧兽医业余中学里，他风雨无阻，来的最早，去得最迟。他攒下钱就买书。那广阔美丽的天然牧场，就是他最理想的课堂。现在他不但是优秀的放牧员，而且是出色的兽医员、接羔员和配种员。他总结和创造出的“夜牧”等放牧方法和“保胎十五不”“接羔十二准备”等经验，不仅使他的丰产群获得更大的丰收，也必然会在青海草原上到处开花、结果。
