    Friendship Flowers by Changjin Lake
    Xihong

    A snowstorm has passed. We visited the famous Changjin Lake battlefield, where the Chinese and Korean People's Armies once fought together in bloody battles, on a clear day after the snow.

    The car, with its rattling chains, slowly climbed the icy Changjin Plateau. Our hearts couldn't help but return to those blizzard days nine years ago. At that time, the Chinese People's Volunteers, without even having time to change into winter uniforms, rushed day and night to the shores of Changjin Lake, fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army to encircle and annihilate the American invaders. They crawled and lay in the snow and ice, seeing off countless sunsets, their feet swollen like steamed buns, eating ice when hungry and drinking snow when thirsty. It was they who personally defended Changjin Lake with bombs and bayonets, giving the American ace army, the 1st Marine Division and the 7th Infantry Division, a severe lesson. The great internationalist fighter, the immortal hero company commander Yang Gensi, shed his last drop of blood on the shores of Changjin Lake. Before we drove to visit Changjin Lake, we heard Korean comrades say that the people of the Changjin area have a particularly deep remembrance of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    The truth is just that. When we visited Changjin Lake, we were always surrounded by friendship and warmth, so everyone's mood was very excited. As soon as we got out of the car, before we had even looked at the face of this plateau town, the enthusiastic hosts, holding bouquets of flowers, led the welcoming crowd to offer wreaths at the Cemetery of the Volunteer Army Martyrs. Then came a sumptuous luncheon. Before the hosts could raise their glasses, they took out photos signed by Volunteer Army soldiers from their pockets and told us about the good impression that the people on the plateau had of their Chinese comrades. They also presented honey brewed from wild fruits and mountain flowers, and said to us enthusiastically: "This is a new product of the Plateau Agricultural Cooperative. Although it is not as good as delicacies, you must take a box to let the Chinese comrades taste the new flavor. There is also a small box of pine nuts that fell in the Cemetery of the Volunteer Army Martyrs. Please take them with you, so that the friendship pine trees can also grow on Chinese soil." These emotional words, these sincere entrustments, are precisely the pure and noble friendship of the Changjin people towards our Chinese People's Volunteers, more precious than gold and jade.

    From this plateau basin surrounded by snowy mountains, we climbed north to Duling Peak and looked out: Flying Crane Peak, burned by napalm bombs; Xiajieyuli, which was only ruins in the setting sun; air-raid shelters all over the cliffs, damp and suffocating; Changjin Lake, with its surging water columns, clouds of smoke, and raging roars... all have changed. The scene before us is truly a changed world; it is clearly a new plateau city. Even veteran soldiers who participated in the Changjin Lake battle would not be able to find any trace of the war on this land if they revisited it.

    The midday sun is warm, the snow on the road is melting, and the icicles under the eaves are melting. Wisps of smoke rise from the red and gray brick houses of thousands of households, and melodious broadcast songs float from thousands of windows. The tall buildings in the field, with thick smoke billowing into the sky, are the newly built brick factories. The people of the plateau are rapidly eliminating those mud houses covered with tree bark. On Flying Crane Peak, the dense pines and firs grow so tall, this is the soil that the immortal hero company commander Yang Gensi embraced with his life. Looking back at Changjin Lake, it is a scene of snow waves and white light. These six thousand hectares of calm lake water not only emit an inexhaustible power source for the industrial cities on the east coast, but are now also the largest freshwater fish farm on the plateau. A silver ribbon-like highway winds around the shores of Changjin Lake, around the pastures of cattle and sheep, and around the fields with fertilizer piled high. A beautiful female tractor driver is sitting high on the driver's seat, starting the Korean-made "Chollima" brand tractor, turning along this road of happiness. On Changjin Lake, this kind of touching and heart-shaking song is raised again:

    When the Volunteer Army comrades came, the American soldiers fled east and west.
    The flowing water of the Changjin River affectionately calls to the Volunteer Army.

    On Duling Peak, there is a Cemetery of Volunteer Army Martyrs. One can see emerald green pines surrounding the tall pavilion of vermilion and bright color; in this season when the mountains are covered with snow, the cemetery is still a verdant scene. The newly planted pine seedlings are all tied with straw for cold protection, the snow on the ground is swept clean, new soil is piled on every martyr's tomb, and no weeds or rocks can be seen on any of the small paths in the cemetery. The tower-style monument, engraved with the name of the Volunteer Army hero company commander Yang Gensi, is tall and free of dust, as if it had just been washed with clean water. This symbolizes the immortal image of Yang Gensi embracing the explosives and sacrificing heroically to defend peace. One can imagine how the people here are holding a hot heart to comfort the heroic souls of the Volunteer Army martyrs resting on the shores of Changjin Lake! How wholeheartedly the people here are turning their friendship with the Chinese People's Volunteers and their mourning for the martyrs into a high enthusiasm for building a socialist and beautiful life on the plateau! We can clearly see that, facing the vast East Sea, a prosperous Changjin Plateau has been born. The plateau full of disasters can only be found in the memories of adults.

    Now the Changjin Plateau has become a large ranch and a large forest farm of the Republic. To commemorate the merits of the Volunteer Army, the Changjin people renamed Sisuli as Liberation Zone. The Liberation Zone Agricultural Cooperative here had at least five pigs, cattle, and sheep raised by each household last year. This year they will double the animal husbandry. The Plateau Forestry Bureau has already produced 110,000 cubic meters of wood for the Republic last year. Thirteen villages on the plateau had no electric lights the year before last. Last year, twenty-five small power stations were newly built, and every household became bright. Local industry has also developed rapidly. Lumber mills, textile mills, leather factories, food processing plants, and paper mills are all available. Four hundred tons of fish can be caught in Changjin Lake this year... Recalling those days of bare hands after the ceasefire, there were no houses on the ground, no cattle or sheep on the grasslands, the elderly had no winter clothes to keep out the cold, and the fertile paddy fields had no seedlings; the people who had just conquered the wounds of war, catching their breath, immediately embarked on this construction journey full of difficulties. Today, they guard domestically produced lathes, sing the Chollima March; they return from the fields, change into brightly colored costumes and go to the club, happily dancing friendship dances; they admire the potted plants in front of the windows in the sunny cultural dormitories. Happiness has truly descended on everyone's side. But what is still missing in their hearts? Why were they so excited when they first met us, sometimes crying, sometimes laughing, unable to control their emotions at all? This is because the Volunteer Army comrades who once shared weal and woe with them on the shores of Changjin Lake are no longer by their side and cannot share happiness with them. In this case, who can suppress the passion for missing comrades when people talk about happiness.

    We deeply feel that every cooperative, every forest farm, every school on the plateau is a beautiful garden nurturing the flowers of Chinese-Korean friendship. Let’s see how Uncle Hong Yixuan cherishes his friendship with the Volunteer Army. This old man was once a brave and resourceful guerrilla on the shores of Changjin Lake. In those fiery days of war, he bravely acted as a guide for the Volunteer Army, transporting ammunition, and even sneaking behind enemy lines to conduct reconnaissance. Therefore, the Volunteer Army comrades respected this old man very much. The representatives of the Volunteer Army withdrawal troops also made a special trip from far away to bid farewell to the old man. Now, although the old man’s teeth have all fallen out, his eyes, as an old guerrilla, are still as bright as they were back then when he talks about the Volunteer Army comrades. The old man is now a warehouse keeper in the commercial sector. Whenever he gets off work, changes into new clothes, and takes his children out to spend the evening, he always silently glances at the monument in the Cemetery of Volunteer Army Martyrs on Duling Peak, which is filled with human feelings. Happy evenings often make people miss their relatives, and Uncle Hong Yixuan often misses the Volunteer Army in such evenings. What a thrilling evening that was! The American tanks had rushed along the shores of Changjin Lake to the front of the Volunteer Army’s position. At this time, Uncle Hong Yixuan was in the Volunteer Army’s position. He personally saw the Volunteer Army comrades beside him raise their arms and shout slogans. A soldier carried an anti-tank mine and rushed down the mountain; then, another soldier jumped out of the position and rushed down the mountain without looking back... Since then, the heroic spirit of the Volunteer Army has left a deep impression in the old man’s mind. It is said that the old man should also spend his old age leisurely, but he still sticks to his glorious construction post, diligently managing the department store warehouse. The old man often says: I want to learn from the spirit of the Volunteer Army comrades and do a good job in the warehouse management of the Republic.

    The Changjin Lumber Mill's work team is named after the immortal hero company commander Yang Gensi. Park Yong-quan, the leader of the Yang Gensi work team, is a very honest and simple young man. Whenever he leads everyone to complete arduous tasks, he always uses the great spirit of the martyr Yang Gensi to inspire people. Over the years, the Yang Gensi work team has always completed the annual production plan ahead of schedule and in excess, and they have always been an advanced red flag of the Changjin Lumber Mill. Last year, before the first snowstorm had fallen on the plateau, the Yang Gensi work team had already completed the annual production plan. In order to feel grateful to the Volunteer Army, Park Yong-quan led all the workers to Duling Peak, planted pine trees in the Cemetery of Volunteer Army Martyrs, offered wreaths to the martyrs, and held a meeting in the cemetery to discuss the production plan for the next year. Then everyone surrounded the monument of martyr Yang Gensi and took a group photo. They are so piously regarding their achievements in production as bouquets of friendship to comfort their relatives, and at the same time so strongly cherishing friendship and cherishing tomorrow.

    Seeing that Changjin Lake is already frozen, the lake of friendship in the hearts of the people of the plateau is always surging with warm currents and always full of surging passion. The Changjin Plateau presented to us is so dazzling with silver light, and the unfading flowers of friendship on the shores of Changjin Lake are blooming everywhere. We can only be intoxicated, only rejoice, and only express our infinite admiration and remembrance to the people of the Chollima country...

    长津湖畔友谊花
    西虹
    一场风雪过去了。我们正好在雪后晴天，访问朝中人民军队曾经在一起浴血苦战的著名的长津湖战场。
    汽车带着哗哗作响的铁链，缓缓地向冰滑的长津高原攀爬着。我们的心不由地回到九年前那些暴风雪的日子。那时候，我国人民志愿军还来不及改换冬装，就日夜兼程赶到长津湖畔，和朝鲜人民军并肩围歼美国侵略者。他们爬卧在冰天雪地里，不知送走了多少个黄昏，脚肿得像发面馒头，饥吃冰块渴饮雪。就是他们，亲手用炸弹和刺刀保卫了长津湖，狠狠地教训了美国的王牌军陆战第一师和步兵第七师。伟大的国际主义战士、不朽的英雄连长杨根思，正是在长津湖畔洒尽了他的最后一滴血。当我们驱车访问长津湖之前，就听到朝鲜同志说过，长津地区的人民对中国人民志愿军有着特别深切的怀念。
    事实正是这样，我们在长津湖畔访问的时候，一直被友谊和温暖所包围，因此每个人的心情都很激动。我们刚下车，还不曾观看一下这个高原市镇的面貌，热诚的主人就怀抱花束，领着欢迎的人群，伴随我们去志愿军烈士陵园敬献花圈。接着就是丰盛的午宴，主人的手还不待把酒杯举起，就从衣兜里掏出有志愿军战士签名的照片，向我们诉说高原上人民对中国战友的好印象。他们还捧出野果山花酿造的蜂蜜，热情地对我们说：“这是高原农业合作社的新产品，虽然比不上珍馐，也得给中国同志带上一箱尝尝新；还有志愿军烈士陵园里落地的松子一小箱，请同志们带上，好让友谊的青松也在中国土地上生长。”这些动情的言谈，这些真挚的嘱托，正是长津人民对我国志愿军的比金玉都纯净高贵的友谊心肠。
    我们从这个雪山环抱的高原盆地，向北登上杜陵峰，放眼眺望：那被汽油弹燃烧过的飞鹤峰；那在夕照中只剩废墟的下碣隅里；那遍布山崖，阴湿闷人的防空洞；那水柱喷涌，弹烟弥漫，狂翻怒吼的长津湖……，全都变了样。眼前的景象真是换了人间，这里分明是一座高原新城。即使是当年参加过长津湖战役的老战士重游到此，也不能从这块土地上找到任何一点战争的伤痕。
    中午的太阳暖融融，路面上的积雪融化了，屋檐下的冰锥融化了。缕缕炊烟从千百户人家红色的、灰色的砖瓦住宅升起来，悦耳的广播歌曲从千百扇窗户飘出来。平野上那一片浓烟冲天的高大的建筑物，是新建的砖瓦厂，高原人民正在迅速消灭那些用树皮复盖的泥草房。飞鹤峰上，密密的松杉长得这样高大，这曾是不朽的英雄连长杨根思用生命拥抱过的土壤。回望长津湖，一派雪波白光。这六千公顷平静的湖水，不仅为东海岸的工业城市发射出取之不尽的动力，如今还是高原上最大的淡水养鱼场。银带般的公路绕过长津湖畔，绕过牛群和羊群的放牧场，绕过肥堆如山的田野。漂亮的女拖拉机手，正高坐驾驶台上，开动朝鲜国产的“千里马牌”拖拉机，沿着这条幸福的道路转来了。长津湖上，又扬起了这般动耳摇心的歌声：
    志愿军同志一来，美国兵都东窜西奔。
    长津江的流水，亲昵地呼唤着志愿军。
    杜陵峰上，有一座志愿军烈士陵园。只见翡翠般的青松环绕着朱红碧亮的高高的碑亭；在这大雪封山的季节，陵园里仍然是一片翠绿。新栽的松苗都绑了防寒的稻草，地上的积雪也打扫得一干二净，每一座烈士墓上都培盖了新土，每一条陵园小道都看不到荒草乱石。那幢镌刻着志愿军英雄连长杨根思烈士英名的塔式纪念碑，高大的碑身微尘不沾，好像刚用清水洗涤过。这正象征着杨根思怀抱炸药，为保卫和平而壮烈牺牲的不朽形象。可以想像得到，这里的人民是捧着怎样一颗赤热的心，来抚慰安息在长津湖畔的志愿军烈士的英魂！这里的人民，又是怎样尽心竭力地把对我国志愿军的友谊和对烈士的悼念，化作在高原上建设社会主义美好生活的高昂的热情！我们清清楚楚地看到，迎着浩瀚的东海，一个富裕的长津高原已经诞生。那灾难重重的高原，只有在成年人的记忆中才能找得到。
    现在长津高原已经变成了共和国的大牧场和大林场。为了纪念志愿军的功勋，长津人民把泗水里改名解放区。这里办的解放区农业合作社，去年每户人家饲养的猪、牛、羊，至少都在五只以上。今年他们还要把畜牧业翻一番。高原林业所去年已经为共和国生产了十一万立方米木材。高原上前年还有十三个里没有电灯，去年新建二十五个小型发电站，每户人家都明亮起来了。地方工业也发展得很快，木材厂、纺织厂、皮革厂、食品加工厂、造纸厂，真是应有尽有。长津湖的鱼今年就可打捞四百吨……。回想停战后那些赤手空拳的日子，地面上没有房屋，草原上没有牛羊，老年人没有防寒的冬衣，肥美的水田没有秧苗；刚刚征服了战争创伤的人民，喘息未定，立即跨上这万般艰难的建设征途。今天，他们守着国产车床，高唱千里马进行曲；他们从田间回来，换上鲜艳的服装走向俱乐部，欢欢喜喜地跳友谊舞；他们在阳光充足的文化宿舍里欣赏窗前的盆景。幸福已经真正地降临到每个人的身边。可是在他们的心灵里到底还缺少些什么呢？为什么刚和我们见面，他们的心情就那样激动，有时哭泣，有时欢笑，一点也控制不住自己的感情呢？这是因为曾经在长津湖畔和他们同甘苦共患难的志愿军同志，如今都不在他们身边，不能跟他们同欢乐共幸福了。在这个情况下，在人们谈论幸福的时候，谁能抑制住思念战友的激情。
    我们深深地感到，高原上的每一个合作社，每一处林场，每一所学校，无处不是滋育着中朝友谊之花的艳丽的园圃。且看洪义铉老伯伯是怎样珍惜他跟志愿军的友谊吧。这位老人曾是长津湖畔的一位骁勇过人的老游击队员呢。当年，在那战火熊熊的风天雪地里，他曾勇敢地为志愿军作向导，运弹药，甚至钻到美军后方进行侦察。因此，志愿军同志非常敬重这位老人。志愿军撤军部队的代表，还特地从很远的地方赶到这里来，向老人告别。现在，老人的牙齿虽然都已脱落，可是一谈起志愿军同志，他那双老游击队员的眼睛仍然像当年一样明亮。老人现在是商业部门的仓库保管员，每当下了班，换上新衣，带上儿女出去消度黄昏的时候，他总要默默地望一眼杜陵峰上志愿军烈士陵园那座系人情怀的碑亭。幸福的黄昏往往会使人怀念亲人，洪义铉老伯伯正是常常在这样的黄昏怀念志愿军。那是怎样一个惊心动魄的黄昏！美军的坦克已经沿着长津湖畔冲到志愿军的阵地前。这时候洪义铉老伯伯正在志愿军的阵地上，他亲眼看到身边的志愿军同志举臂喊口号，一个战士提着反坦克雷向着山下冲去了；接着，又有一个战士跳出阵地，头也不回地向着山下冲去了……。从这以后，志愿军的英雄气概就在老人的脑子里留下深刻的印象。按说，老人也该清闲地度过他的晚年了，但是，他仍然坚守着光荣的建设岗位，兢兢业业地经理着百货仓库。老人常说：我要学习志愿军同志的精神，把共和国的仓库保管工作作好。
    长津制材厂的作业班是以不朽的英雄连长杨根思命名的。杨根思作业班班长朴永铨，是个非常敦实的年青人，每逢率领大家去完成艰巨任务的时候，他总是拿杨根思烈士的伟大精神来鼓舞人心。这些年来，杨根思作业班一向都提前、超额完成年度生产计划，他们一向就是长津制材厂的一面先进的红旗。去年，当第一场风雪还没有在高原上降落的时候，杨根思作业班已经完成了全年的生产计划。为了感念志愿军，朴永铨班长便领着全班工友，一路去到杜陵峰上，在志愿军烈士陵园栽植松树，向烈士献花圈，又在陵园开会，讨论了下年度的生产计划，然后大家环绕着杨根思烈士的纪念碑，合影留念。他们是这样虔诚地把自己在生产上所取得的成就，当成友谊的花束告慰亲人，同时又这样强烈地珍爱友谊，珍爱明天。
    眼看长津湖已经结冰，但是高原人民心中那友谊的湖，却永远滚荡着暖流，永远充满着澎湃的激情。呈现在我们面前的长津高原是这样银光耀眼，长津湖畔不谢的友谊之花又是这样遍地盛开。我们只有陶醉，只有欢欣，只有对千里马国度的人民表示无限的敬仰和怀念……。
