    West Germany's so-called "Emergency Law" draft is a thoroughly fascist decree. According to newspaper reports, according to the provisions of the bill, as long as the Chancellor makes a request, the Federal President can order the declaration of a "state of emergency," and even if the parliament does not agree, it cannot be prevented. This means that the West German Federal Chancellor will now be able to arbitrarily declare a nationwide "state of emergency." Under a "state of emergency," the federal government has almost unlimited powers, including deploying West Germany's national police and armed forces, depriving the people of basic freedoms such as speech, assembly, and movement, and promulgating various legally binding regulations without going through parliament.

    The West German government's desire to create this fascist decree has been a long-standing issue. As early as the autumn of 1958, West German Interior Minister Schröder revealed that the West German government was drafting an "Emergency Law." Due to strong public opposition, the West German government has been hesitant to make it public.

    Recently, the West German authorities have intensified their persecution of domestic peace and democratic forces while condoning the anti-Semitic provocations of fascist elements. This shows that the West German government is further strengthening its fascist rule at home. In this context, Schröder publicly announced at a press conference on January 18 this year that the West German government had already passed the draft of this decree at a secret cabinet meeting on the 13th; and blatantly stated that the main purpose of introducing this decree was to ensure the ability to "suppress domestic rebellions."

    The "Emergency Law" draft is scheduled to be submitted to the Federal Parliament for its first reading in March; before that, it should also be passed by the Federal Senate. Since the content of the bill involves amending the constitution, it must have a two-thirds majority in parliament to be passed. The Christian Democratic Union of Adenauer, which only has a simple majority in the Federal Parliament, is stepping up "consultations" behind the scenes with the right-wing leaders of the Social Democratic Party in order to obtain its support.

    西德的新法西斯法令
    西德的所谓“紧急状态法”草案，是一项彻头彻尾的法西斯法令。据报纸透露，按照该法案的规定，只要总理提出要求，联邦总统就可以下令宣布“紧急状态”，即使议会不同意也不可能加以阻止。这就是说，西德联邦总理今后实际上将有可能任意宣布全国处于“紧急状态”。而在“紧急状态”下，联邦政府所拥有的权力几乎是无限的，包括调度西德全国的警察和武装部队，剥夺人民的言论、集会、迁徙等各项基本自由，以及不经过议会而颁布各种具有法律效力的条例等。
    西德政府想搞这项法西斯法令，是由来已久的事了。早在1958年秋，西德内政部长施罗德就曾经透露西德政府正在草拟“紧急状态法”的消息。由于遭到公众的强烈反对，西德政府才迟迟不敢把它公开提出来。
    最近，西德当局一面加紧迫害国内的和平和民主力量，一面纵容法西斯分子的反犹挑衅。这表明西德政府正在进一步加强国内的法西斯统治。在这种情况下，施罗德今年1月18日在记者招待会上公开宣布，西德政府已经在13日的内阁秘密会议通过了这项法令的草案；并且露骨地说提出这项法令的主要目的是确保能够“镇压国内的叛乱”。
    “紧急状态法”草案预定将在3月间提交联邦议院一读；在这以前它还应由联邦参议院通过。由于该法案的内容牵涉修改宪法的问题，它在议会中必须有三分之二的多数票才能获得通过。在联邦议院中只拥有简单多数的阿登纳的基督教民主联盟，为此正在幕后同社会民主党右翼领导加紧“磋商”，以便取得它的支持。　　　　（才）
