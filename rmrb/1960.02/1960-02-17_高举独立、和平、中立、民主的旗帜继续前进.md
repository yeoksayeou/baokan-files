    Continue to Advance Holding High the Banner of Independence, Peace, Neutrality, and Democracy
    Chairman of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, Nosaka Sanzō

    (I)
    On January 19th of this year, the United States and the reactionary forces of Japan signed the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and its supplementary documents. This is a new aggressive U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty concluded by the U.S. and Japanese reactionary forces based on common interests and directed against countries such as the Soviet Union and China. On the one hand, the United States is attempting to incorporate Japan more firmly into its atomic strategy system under its control than in the past, in order to reverse its military and political decline in the Far East. On the other hand, the Japanese monopoly capital and the traitorous reactionary forces centered on Nobusuke Kishi are willing to go to great lengths to conclude this military alliance, attempting to use the United States as a backer, and rely on this military alliance to openly establish a militarist system and once again carry out imperialist overseas expansion in Asia. The signing of the new "Security Treaty" and various agreements has shown this intention at home and abroad. This is a blatant challenge to the people of our country and the peace-loving people of Asian countries. This is something we absolutely cannot tolerate.
    According to the new "Security Treaty," the United States still has the right to establish military bases anywhere in Japan, and the bases and their surrounding areas are practically under extraterritoriality, just like the Shanghai concessions in the past. Japan's sovereignty is not only being trampled on by the United States as it was in the past, but with this revision of the "Security Treaty," the Nobusuke Kishi government is even more actively and permanently selling Japan's sovereignty to the United States.
    In the new treaty, the Nobusuke Kishi government openly touts mutual "cooperation" between Japan and the United States and assures the United States that Japan and the United States can jointly fight for the "peace and security of the Far East." In the past, Japanese imperialists, under the slogans of "for the peace of the Orient" and the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," invaded and plundered China and other Asian countries, and harmed the people of various countries. We remember this vividly. Now, Nobusuke Kishi, one of the top leaders who launched this war of aggression, is openly saying that he wants to cooperate with the United States "for the peace of the Far East." From this point alone, the fact that the new treaty is aggressive and offensive is very obvious. Moreover, Foreign Minister Fujiyama openly stated in the Diet that the scope of the "Far East" even includes "China and the coastal areas of the Soviet Union." It is clear that the spearhead of this U.S.-Japan military alliance is aimed at China and the Soviet Union. Furthermore, this military alliance actually means that Japan has joined the Northeast Asia Treaty Organization. This is a new threat to Asia.
    Under the name of "common defense," the new treaty obligates our country to carry out nuclear armament and increase military preparations. The likes of Nobusuke Kishi are verbally trying to deny this, but in reality, they are constantly turning it into a fait accompli. The "Second Defense Plan," scheduled to be implemented from next year, stipulates that the "Self-Defense Forces" will be reorganized with missile equipment as the center, and among the types of missiles, those that cannot be equipped with nuclear warheads will be transformed into those that can be equipped with nuclear warheads, and the missile and atomic industries will be developed vigorously and rapidly. The "Self-Defense Forces" will increase by about 10,000 people each year, and missile training will be carried out. In this way, the likes of Nobusuke Kishi are desperately trying to turn our country from a victim of atomic bombs into a perpetrator.
    While the spearhead of the new treaty is aimed abroad, it is also aimed at the working people of our country. The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries want to use the new treaty as a means to deprive the Japanese people of all the remaining democratic rights and systems acquired after the war, revise the constitution for the worse, and attack the people more and more barbarously in order to further strengthen reactionary rule. This can be clearly seen from the following facts. That is, the Nobusuke Kishi government is already preparing to formulate or take administrative measures to implement the law prohibiting demonstrations around the Diet, establish a capital "defense force" (that is, revive the pre-war Imperial Guard), secrecy laws, anti-espionage laws, a single-seat constituency system to establish a dictatorial system of the Liberal Democratic Party, and a series of anti-democratic and reactionary bills such as the "amendment to the Police Officer Duties Execution Law."
    Since the new treaty makes Japan responsible for increasing its military strength, Japan's military expenditure will inevitably expand rapidly in the future. This year's military expenditure has already increased by 12.5 billion yen compared with the previous year, and if indirect military expenditure is added, it accounts for 20% of the entire national budget. Needless to say, this will inevitably make the people's lives suffer increasingly heavy oppression. At the same time, the production of weapons has also expanded. The proportion of factors necessary to exacerbate tension in Japan's industrial structure is increasing.
    As mentioned above, the new "Security Treaty" and its supplementary agreements threaten the peace and security of the Far East and Japan, and are trampling on the independence and democracy of our country. Especially when the overall situation in the world is developing in the direction of disarmament and peaceful coexistence of two systems, a new military alliance treaty has been signed between the United States and Japan. This treaty will exist for at least eleven years in the future.
    The signing of the new "Security Treaty" will inevitably lead to Japan's increasing isolation in the world. China, the Soviet Union, as well as India, Indonesia, Vietnam and other Asian countries have expressed deep anxiety about the new "Security Treaty" and have taken opposing attitudes. In particular, the "Memorandum" submitted by the Soviet government to the Japanese government on January 27, while strongly protesting, announced the withdrawal of the guarantee to return Habomai and Shikotan once a Japanese-Soviet peace treaty is concluded. This is also natural. Even newspapers in South Korea, Taiwan, and the Philippines, which have alliance relations with Japan, had already issued warnings about the revival of Japanese militarism before the new treaty was signed. Now, it is very clear that no country in the world except the United States welcomes this new treaty.

    (II)
    The new treaty has been signed. However, the struggle will continue in the future. The Japanese people's fighting spirit against the new treaty has not weakened at all. On the contrary, the struggle is rising. In early February, the new treaty and various agreements were submitted to the Diet for discussion. Representatives of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party have already fiercely condemned the Nobusuke Kishi government in the Diet. Representatives of the Democratic Socialist Party, which emerged after the split of the Socialist Party, also opposed this treaty.
    Since Nobusuke Kishi and his ilk proposed revising the "Security Treaty" in September of the year before last, the Japanese people's struggle to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the "Security Treaty" has been rising continuously for a year and a half, and has developed in an unprecedented depth.
    In the meantime, in October of the year before last, the Nobusuke Kishi government attempted to revise the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law" in order to revive the police state. The national-scale joint struggle against the revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law" crushed the government's conspiracy. The national joint struggle organization established in this struggle later developed into the "National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the Security Treaty." Nearly 140 national organizations have joined this organization. The members of these organizations total about five million. Organizations such as the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, trade unions ("Sohyo," neutral system trade unions), farmers' organizations, youth, students, women, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs groups, peace organizations, and international friendship organizations participate in this "National Conference." In addition, scholars, cultural groups, and religious groups have also participated in the joint struggle. Moreover, under the leadership of this "National Conference," local joint struggle organizations have been established everywhere throughout the country. The number of such organizations is close to 1,000, five times the number of joint struggle organizations established during the struggle against the revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law." Some anti-Communist elements secretly attempted to exclude the Communist Party from these joint struggle organizations, but none of them succeeded. Because in many respects, without the correct policies and active activities of the Communist Party, it would be difficult to mobilize the masses and organize joint actions.
    What is particularly important in terms of joint struggle is that the grassroots masses of the Socialist Party, in violation of the will of some upper-level figures of the party, actively cooperated with Communist Party members to carry out joint struggles. There are more places doing this than in the past. In fact, whether at the central or local level, the movement is being advanced with the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and "Sohyo" as the center.
    Also noteworthy is that a portion of farmers, who account for 30% of our country's population, have begun to participate in this struggle. Japanese farmers are almost in an unorganized state. The countryside has become a strong social base for the Liberal Democratic Party. Farmers have never participated in such political struggles before. However, due to recognizing the essence of the revision of the "Security Treaty," although few in number, progressive farmers have raised the banner of justice and struggled together with the workers. Famous scholars and artists have also taken active action, and even Buddhists and Christians have participated in this movement.
    As of the end of last year, under the leadership of the "National Conference," eleven national-scale "unified actions" against the revision of the "Security Treaty" have been organized. When the eighth unified action was held in November of last year, three million people across the country held protest rallies and demonstrations. In Tokyo, 30,000 workers, citizens, and students went to the Diet to petition against the revision of the "Security Treaty." The panicked government mobilized armed police and set up a blockade line with armored vehicles in front of the Diet, attempting to prevent the masses from exercising this legitimate right of petition. As a result, some indignant masses broke through the blockade line, and an incident occurred in which they rushed into the Diet. The government seized this opportunity to attack, arrested many workers and students, and submitted to the Diet a "law prohibiting demonstrations around the Diet," further intensifying repression. However, the masses' fighting spirit cannot be frustrated. Later, the people launched the tenth and eleventh unified actions, continuing to carry out fierce struggles, and preparing to launch new and powerful struggles in April and May of this year when the Liberal Democratic Party forces the Diet to approve the new treaty. At the end of January of this year, a mass foot march, under the slogans of "Return Okinawa to Japan" and "Oppose the 'Security Treaty'," has already started from Kagoshima at the southern tip of Kyushu and is advancing towards Tokyo.
    The methods of struggle against the "Security Treaty" have also become diversified. In addition to mass rallies, demonstrations, and large marches, struggle methods that are easy for the broad masses of people to participate in, such as petitioning signatures to the Diet and home visits, have also been adopted. At the initiative of the "National Conference," a signature campaign for petitioning the Diet has been launched nationwide.
    In addition, a new wave of workers' struggles is currently being launched, centered on the coal miners' struggle. These economic struggles are often combined with the struggle against the "Security Treaty" and to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet.

    (III)
    The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party held its Eighth Plenary Session from January 22nd, and determined the party's basic policy on the struggle to prevent the ratification of the "Security Treaty." The resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session stated: "In this struggle, the party must take the prevention of ratification and the striving for the abolition of the 'Security Treaty' and the crushing of the San Francisco system as the goals of the struggle. At the same time, this struggle must be advanced as a long-term and persistent struggle to strive for the establishment of a national democratic united front. To this end, we must combine the current political tasks of the people with the various demands of the people to carry out the struggle."
    In places such as Gunma Prefecture, temporary joint struggle organizations organized to oppose the "Security Treaty" have, in the course of the struggle, put forward comprehensive disarmament, restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and other political demands as well as various demands of the local people; they have begun to develop into democratic united front organizations led by the Communist Party and the Socialist Party that support democracy. This is an embryonic form of the national democratic united front.
    The resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session continued: "At the present stage, we must expand and develop unified actions to prevent ratification, and in this action, we must struggle for the demand to dissolve the Diet. In the struggle, we must continue to strengthen the struggle against U.S. imperialism. We must also increase the people's indignation and public opinion condemnation of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet in the struggle, and launch the struggle with the slogan of 'Overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet.' In this way, in order to practically create the conditions for overthrowing the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, we must combine the struggle in the Diet with the mass movement as the foundation."
    The Eighth Plenary Session made the following provisions for specific policies:
    1. In order to realize opposition to industrial "rationalization," raise wages, and other demands, workers should be mobilized to conduct fierce struggles. The party stands at the forefront of this struggle and does its best to combine this struggle with the struggle against the "Security Treaty." Joint struggle organizations should be established rapidly in factories and regions that have not yet been organized. Union members should be actively involved to strengthen the leadership of the working class. Redouble efforts to organize farmers in the movement against the "Security Treaty."
    2. Putting forward the various economic and political demands of the people, thereby bringing people with various demands together around the movement against the revision of the "Security Treaty," and developing the current joint struggle organizations into permanent organizations capable of performing this task.
    3. Strengthen the leadership and organization of the central "National Conference."
    4. While criticizing the reactionary nature of the Democratic Socialist Party (the Socialist Party of Nishio), which hinders unified action, efforts should be made to win over workers under its influence to participate in joint struggles.
    5. Fight against the provocations of the Trotskyites and guide some student masses under their influence in the right direction.
    6. The task of the Diet struggle is becoming increasingly important. While further strengthening the activities of the small number of our party's Diet members, preparations should be made in advance for the dissolution of the Diet and the holding of elections.
    After the struggle against "work performance ratings" and the struggle against the revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law," the working class has carried out a year and a half of struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty" and has accumulated valuable political experience in the struggle. They have recognized the real enemy; at the same time, they have realized the importance of the united front in the process of fighting this enemy. The working class is beginning to realize its historical mission of leading and organizing the entire people. Moreover, the working class has actually become the core of the people's joint struggle throughout the country. This is a gain that nothing can replace.
    In these struggles, the Communist Party has played an active role, and its prestige among the masses has continued to increase. Our Communist Party itself has also strengthened its unity, improved its combat effectiveness, and strengthened its ties with the masses in the struggle.
    It can be seen that the U.S. and Japanese reactionary forces' attempt to strengthen their rule by revising the "Security Treaty" has actually produced the result of increasingly strengthening the forces to destroy their rule.
    Faced with the current arduous task, we are mobilizing the broad masses of people to rise up and struggle with the Japanese working class as the center. In past struggles, the support of the Chinese people has been a truly great encouragement and assistance to us.
    Holding high the banner of independence, peace, neutrality, and democracy, the Japanese people, full of confidence in victory, are continuing to advance along the path taken by the Chinese people. (Special contribution to this newspaper)

    高举独立、和平、中立、民主的旗帜继续前进
    日本共产党中央委员会主席　野坂参三
    （一）
    今年1月19日，美国同日本的反动势力签署了新的日美“安全条约”及其附属文件。这是美日反动势力基于共同利益而缔结的、以苏中等国为敌的新的侵略性日美军事同盟条约。一方面，美国企图在它的控制下，比过去更牢固地把我们日本纳入原子战略体系，以挽回它在远东所处的军事和政治上的颓势。另一方面，以日本垄断资本和岸信介为中心的卖国反动势力，甘愿为缔结这一军事同盟疯狂奔走，企图以美国作为靠山，凭着这一军事同盟，公然确立军国主义体制，再度向亚洲进行帝国主义的海外扩张。新的“安全条约”及各项协定的签署，已经向国内外表明了这种意图。这是对我国人民和亚洲爱好和平各国人民的露骨的挑战。这是我们断然不能容许的。
    根据新的“安全条约”，美国依然有权利在日本全国的任何地方建立军事基地，而且基地及其周围地方简直就像过去上海租界地那样，处于治外法权之下。日本的主权不仅和过去一样遭受美国的蹂躏，而且经过这次修改“安全条约”，岸信介政府更主动地、长期地把日本的主权出卖给美国。
    岸信介政府在新条约中公然标榜日美两国相互“合作”，并且向美国保证，为了“远东的和平与安全”，日美可以共同作战。过去，日本帝国主义者曾经在所谓“为了东洋的和平”和“大东亚共荣圈”的口号下，侵略和掠夺过中国及其他亚洲国家，残害各国人民。我们对此记忆犹新。现在，发动这场侵略战争的最高负责人之一的岸信介，又公然说什么要“为了远东的和平”而和美国协同作战。仅就这一点来看，新条约是侵略性的、具有进攻性的事实，也是十分明显的。而且，藤山外相在国会上公开说，“远东”的范围连“中国和苏联滨海边区”都包括在内。由此可见，这一日美军事同盟的矛头指向中国和苏联，是再清楚不过的了。再则，这一军事同盟实际上意味着日本加入了东北亚条约组织。这对亚洲是一个新的威胁。
    新条约在“共同防卫”的名义下，使我国负有实行核武装和增强军备的义务。岸信介之流在口头上极力否认这一点，但是实际上正不断地使之成为既成事实。预定从明年度起实行的“第二次防卫计划”规定，以导弹装备为中心改编“自卫队”，在导弹的种类中也要把不能装核弹头的变成能够装核弹头的，并且大力而又迅速地发展导弹和原子工业。“自卫队”每年增加一万人左右，并实行导弹的训练工作。就这样，岸信介之流正在拼死命地要把我们国家从原子弹受害国变成加害国。
    新条约的矛头在指向国外的同时，也指向我国的劳动人民。日美反动派想以新条约为手段，剥夺日本人民在战后取得的民主权利和制度的一切残余，朝着坏的方面修改宪法，而且为了进一步加强反动统治，将日益蛮横地向人民进攻。从下面的事实可以很清楚地看到这一点。这就是，岸信介政府已经准备制定或采取行政措施来实行禁止在国会周围示威游行法、建立首都“防卫队”（即复活战前那样的近卫师团）、保密法、防谍法，为确立自由民主党独裁体制的小选举区制度，以及“警察官职务执行法修正案”等一系列反民主的反动法案。
    由于新条约使日本承担了增强军事力量的义务，今后日本的军费必将迅速地膨胀起来。今年度的军费已经比上一年度增加了一百二十五亿日元，如果加上间接军费，则占整个国家预算的20％。不消说，这一定会使人民生活日益遭受沉重的压迫。同时，武器的生产也扩大了。为加剧紧张所必需的因素在日本产业结构中所占的比重日益增大。
    如前所述，新“安全条约”及其附属的各项协定，威胁着远东和日本的和平与安全，并且在蹂躏我国的独立和民主。尤其是当整个世界的局势正朝着废除军备和两种制度和平共处的方向发展的时候，日美两国之间签署了新的军事同盟条约。今后这个条约至少要存在十一年。
    新“安全条约”的签订，必然会使日本在世界上越来越孤立。中国、苏联以及印度、印度尼西亚、越南及其他亚洲国家，对于新的“安全条约”表示深刻的不安，并且采取反对的态度。尤其是，苏联政府于1月27日向日本政府提出的“备忘录”，在强硬抗议的同时，宣布撤销关于一旦缔结日苏和约就交还齿舞、色丹的保证。这也是理所当然的。就连那些和日本有同盟关系的南朝鲜、台湾、菲律宾的报纸，也都在新条约签署前就已经对日本军国主义的复活发出了警告。现在，非常明显的是除美国以外，世界上没有任何一个国家欢迎这个新条约。
                    （二）
    新条约是已经签署了。但是，今后斗争还要继续下去。日本人民反对新条约的斗志，一点也没有削弱。相反地，斗争日益高涨。2月初，新条约及各项协定提交国会讨论。共产党、社会党的代表，已经在国会内激烈地谴责岸信介政府。在社会党分裂后产生的民主社会党的代表，也反对这个条约。
    从前年9月岸信介之流提出修改“安全条约”以来，经过一年半的时间，日本人民为阻止修改和争取废除“安全条约”的斗争一直不断地高涨，并且有了空前的纵深发展。
    在这中间，前年10月岸信介政府为了复活警察国家，企图修改“警察官职务执行法”。全国规模的反对修改“警职法”的共同斗争，粉碎了政府的阴谋。在这一斗争中建立的全国性共同斗争组织，后来发展为“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”。加入这个组织的有近一百四十个全国性的团体。这些团体所属的成员约达五百万人。参加这个“国民会议”的有共产党、社会党、工会（“总评”、中立系统工会）、农民组织、青年、学生、妇女、中小企业家团体、和平团体及国际友好团体等各种组织。此外，学者、文化界团体、宗教界团体，也都参加了共同斗争。而且，在这个“国民会议”领导下，全国各地到处建立了地方性共同斗争组织。这种组织的数量近一千个，为反对修改“警职法”斗争时建立的共同斗争组织的五倍。一部分反共分子曾经暗中企图在这些共同斗争组织中排除共产党，结果都没有得逞。因为在许多方面，如果没有共产党的正确方针和积极活动，要动员群众和组织共同行动是很困难的。
    在共同斗争方面尤其重要的是，社会党的基层群众违反该党一部分上层人物的意志，积极和共产党员合作，进行共同斗争。这样做的地方比过去增加了。实际上，无论在中央或地方，都是以共产党、社会党和“总评”三方面为中心把运动推向前进的。
    还有值得注意的是，占我国人口30％的农民，已经有一部分人开始参加这一斗争。日本的农民几乎是处于没有组织的状态。农村成了自由民主党的有力的社会阵地。农民还从来没有参加过这样的政治斗争。但是，由于认清了修改“安全条约”的实质，虽然为数不多、然而是进步的农民，揭起义旗，和工人共同进行斗争。著名的学者和艺术家也积极地行动起来，而且连佛教徒、基督教徒也都参加了这个运动。
    截至去年年底为止，在“国民会议”的领导下，组织了十一次全国规模的反对修改“安全条约”的“统一行动”。去年11月举行第八次统一行动时，全国有三百万群众举行了抗议集会和示威游行。在东京，有三万名工人、市民和学生等，到国会去进行反对修改“安全条约”的请愿。惊惶失措的政府动员武装警察，在国会前面以装甲车设立封锁线，企图阻止群众行使这种正当的请愿权。结果，一部分激愤的群众，冲破封锁线，发生了冲进国会的事件。政府抓住这个机会进攻，逮捕了许多工人和学生，并向国会提出“禁止在国会周围示威游行法”，进一步加紧实行镇压。然而，群众的斗志是挫折不了的。后来，人民群众又发起第十次和第十一次统一行动，继续进行激烈的斗争，并且准备在今年4、5月间自由民主党强迫国会批准新条约的时候，进行新的强有力的斗争。今年1月底，在“把冲绳归还日本”、“反对‘安全条约’”的口号下，一个群众性的徒步大游行队伍，已经从九州南端的鹿儿岛出发向东京前进。
    反对“安全条约”斗争的方式也变得多样化了。除了群众集会、示威游行和大游行之外，还采取了向国会请愿签名和家庭访问等便于广大人民参加的斗争方式。在“国民会议”的倡议下，已经在全国范围内开始掀起了向国会请愿的签名运动。
    此外，目前以煤矿工人斗争为中心，掀起了新的工人斗争的浪潮。这些经济斗争经常同反对“安全条约”、打倒岸信介内阁的斗争结合在一起进行。
                    （三）
    日本共产党中央委员会从1月22日起召开了第八次全会，确定了党关于阻止批准“安全条约”斗争的基本方针。八中全会决议中说道：“党在这一斗争中必须以阻止批准和争取废除‘安全条约’以及粉碎旧金山体系作为斗争的目标。同时必须作为争取建立民族民主统一战线的长期持久的斗争来推进这项斗争。为此，必须把人民当前的政治任务同人民的各项要求结合起来进行斗争。”
    在群马县等地方，为反对“安全条约”而组织的暂时的共同斗争组织，已经在斗争的过程中，提出全面裁军、恢复日中邦交和其他政治要求以及地方人民的各项要求；开始向以共产党、社会党为中心的拥护民主的持久的统一战线组织发展。这是民族民主统一战线的一个萌芽。
    八中全会决议接着说道：“在现今的阶段，我们必须扩大和发展阻止批准的统一行动，并且在这一行动中为要求解散国会而斗争。在斗争中必须继续加强反对美帝国主义的斗争。我们还必须增强斗争中的人民对岸信介内阁的义愤和舆论谴责，而且提出‘打倒岸信介内阁’的口号来开展斗争。这样，为了实际创造打倒岸信介内阁的条件，必须以群众运动为基础，同国会内的斗争结合起来进行斗争。”
    八中全会对于具体方针作了如下的规定：
    一、为了实现反对产业“合理化”、提高工资及其他要求，发动工人进行激烈的斗争。党站在这一斗争的最前线，尽全力把这项斗争同反对“安全条约”的斗争结合起来。在还没有组织起来的工厂、地区迅速地建立共同斗争的组织。使工会会员积极参加进来，以加强工人阶级的领导。加倍努力把农民组织在反对“安全条约”的运动中。
    二、提出人民的各种经济要求和政治要求，从而使具有各种要求的人们集合在反对修改“安全条约”的运动的周围，把现在的共同斗争组织发展成为胜任这项任务的永久性组织。
    三、加强中央的“国民会议”的领导力量和组织。
    四、在批判妨害统一行动的民主社会党（西尾的社会党）的反动性同时，努力争取在它影响下的工人参加共同斗争。
    五、同托洛茨基分子的挑衅进行斗争，把他们影响下的某些学生群众引导到正确的方向来。
    六、国会斗争的任务日益重要。在进一步加强为数不多的我党的国会议员团的活动同时，为解散国会和举行选举预先作好准备。
    工人阶级继反对“勤务评定”和反对修改“警职法”的斗争之后，又进行了一年半的反对修改“安全条约”的斗争，并且在斗争中积累了宝贵的政治经验。他们认清了真正的敌人；同时，在同这个敌人作斗争的过程中体会到统一战线的重要性。工人阶级开始觉悟到自己所负有的领导和组织全体人民的历史使命。而且，实际上工人阶级已经成了全国各地人民进行共同斗争的核心。这是任何东西都代替不了的收获。
    在这些斗争中，共产党发挥了积极的作用，它在群众中的威信不断提高。我们共产党本身也在斗争中加强了团结，提高了战斗能力，并且加强了同群众的联系。
    由此可见，日美反动势力妄图通过修改“安全条约”以加强它们的统治，但实际上反而产生了日益加强摧毁它们统治的力量的结果。
    面对着目前的艰巨任务，我们正以日本工人阶级为中心发动广大人民起来斗争。在过去的斗争中，中国人民的声援对于我们来说，真正是巨大的鼓舞和援助。
    高举独立、和平、中立、民主的旗帜，满怀胜利信心的日本人民，正在沿着中国人民所走的方向继续前进。　　　（本报特约稿）
