    The Soviet People Gave Me New Hands
    Xu Xuehui
    I left my motherland on January 13 to go to the Soviet Union to have prosthetic hands fitted. I stayed in the Soviet Union for a total of nineteen days. During these nineteen days, I felt immense happiness and was greatly encouraged every moment.
    Since I was injured, I have constantly received letters from people all over the country and friends from abroad. The warm condolences and encouragement from the Party and comrades have always given me tremendous encouragement. At the end of July last year, I received a letter from Comrade Lomanov, director of the Chita Orthopedic Equipment Factory in the Soviet Union, which moved me very much. Comrade Lomanov invited me to the Soviet Union, saying in the letter that he was willing to help me fit prosthetic hands. Now, my prosthetic hands have been fitted with the care of Comrade Lomanov and many other Soviet comrades.
    In the Soviet Union, I not only had prosthetic hands fitted, but I also received a deep internationalist education. On January 15, when I entered the Soviet Union, it was not yet dawn, and it was snowing heavily, and it was particularly cold, with the temperature almost forty degrees below zero; but Comrade Lomanov and his wife, representatives of the Chita Communist Youth League Committee, and the director of the Chita Social Welfare Bureau were all waiting for me at the station on the border. This enthusiasm of the Soviet friends made me, a girl who grew up in the Chinese border and had never been abroad, feel infinitely warm. Before I could get off the train, Comrade Lomanov hugged me tightly and kissed me like a father. As soon as I entered the station lounge, he hurriedly asked me how my wound was healing, and said that he had been anxiously unable to sleep for many days because he didn't know if my wound had healed. Then, he hurriedly comforted me and said, "Don't worry, don't worry, everything will be fine. The Soviet people will do everything possible to help you and restore your ability to work."
    The day after arriving in Chita, the factory sent someone early in the morning to take measurements and make me cold-proof leather gloves and the first pair of working hands. These were sleeves with and without screws. These sleeves can clamp various utensils, allowing me to eat, write, brush my teeth, comb my hair, and even do needlework. Later, another pair of working hands was sent, which was a leather sleeve that fits on the elbow and can clamp many kinds of tools, such as saws, axes, hammers, etc., enabling me to do heavy work and regain the ability to work. When I saw that I could comb my hair again, work, and even write, how happy I was! At that moment, I couldn't help but shed tears, as if I were the happiest person in the world. The third pair of cosmetic hands was really exquisite. At first glance, they were almost indistinguishable from real hands, with a rosy color and natural wrinkles on the skin. I believe that the Soviet comrades must have put a lot of effort into helping me, but Comrade Lomanov never wanted to tell me about this. He only told us at the end how many people participated in this work.
    The Soviet people have a deep friendship with the Chinese people. I lived in a hotel in Chita, and people came to visit me every day, inviting me to parties or to their homes as guests. When I ate in the hotel, people often quietly opened the door and specially said "Wish you happiness" and "Wish you a good meal"; when walking on the street, Soviet friends coming towards me would also say "Wish you happiness"! This time, when I came back on the Moscow-Beijing train, many Soviet friends on the train had seen my photo in the newspaper. A Soviet expert who came to work in China found me and came with his wife to see me. He kept saying to me, "You are great, great. I hope you will always maintain your heroic spirit."
    In those days in the Soviet Union, Comrade Lomanov was so busy, but he still came to see me two or three times a day, and taught me one or two movements every day. Whenever I learned a movement, he would hug me tightly, shake me, pat me, and say happily, "Khorosho! Khorosho!" (Good! Good!) On January 17, Comrade Lomanov held a family banquet to entertain me. At this banquet, the director of the Social Welfare Bureau was very happy to see that I could eat by myself: "This is great. This is not only a happy event for the Chinese people, but also a great happy event for us Soviet people. Everyone is happy for you!" At the banquet, Comrade Lomanov said: "I really wish I had a daughter like you." I also said with emotion: "I also wish I had a father like you." At this time, everyone at the meal raised their glasses together to toast the Lomanov family for adding a Chinese daughter. Comrade Lomanov's mother-in-law prepared a lot of delicious food for us. I asked the old lady to toast, and she said, "I have never drunk alcohol, but today I am very moved and very happy. Okay, I'll have a drink!"
    Nineteen days is not a long time, but how much I have learned from the Soviet people! Their courage, perseverance, and revolutionary optimism have given me tremendous strength. I saw a Soviet comrade in the Chita Blind Factory. This comrade was blind and also missing a right hand; but he had a prosthetic hand fitted and became a very good carpenter. Comrade Lomanov himself is a very good example. He is already over fifty years old, but he is so optimistic and lively. He often says that he is still a young man.
    Comrade Lomanov not only fitted me with prosthetic hands, but also constantly encouraged me. When I first learned to eat and write by myself, I hurriedly and happily asked him if I could put on clothes, if I could comb my hair, if I could do this, if I could do that. He said seriously: "As long as you have a strong will, you can do it." I always remember what he said. Later, whenever I had feelings of fear or shyness, I would think of his words, and courage would come.
    When I was about to leave Chita, my heart was always restless. On the evening of the day I left, the Transbaikal Radio Station in Chita Oblast asked me to speak. I really wanted to take out my whole heart and express my greetings to the great Soviet people. I said these few words: "As I am about to leave the beautiful city of Chita, please allow me to express my heartfelt thanks to you once again. Your deep concern and meticulous care for me demonstrate the lofty internationalist spirit of the Soviet people and their deep friendship with the Chinese people. The hand of friendship has given me lifelong strength. I will definitely work harder and work actively, and I will never let down the Soviet people's warm expectations of me."
    Now I have returned to my beloved motherland, but everything I experienced in the Soviet Union is still deeply engraved in my heart. I must use this pair of hands that the Soviet people fitted for me, this pair of hands of Sino-Soviet friendship, to better contribute everything I have to the socialist construction of the motherland and to the continuous development and consolidation of Sino-Soviet friendship!

    苏联人民给了我新的双手
    徐学惠
    我在1月13日离开祖国，到苏联去安装假手。在苏联一共住了十九天。在这十九天中，我每时每刻都感到莫大的幸福，受到莫大的鼓舞。
    自从我负伤以后，不断收到国内各地人民和国外朋友们的来信。党和同志们的热情慰问和鼓励，经常地给我以巨大的鼓舞力量。去年七月底，我收到了苏联赤塔整形器材厂厂长洛玛诺夫同志的来信，这封信使我非常感动。洛玛诺夫同志约我去苏联，在信上说，愿意帮助我安装假手。现在，我的假手已在洛玛诺夫同志和其它许多苏联同志的关怀下安装好了。
    我在苏联不仅装上了假手，还深深地受到了国际主义教育。1月15日进入苏联国境的时候，天还不怎么亮，下着鹅毛般的大雪，特别冷，气温差不多在零下四十多度；可是洛玛诺夫同志夫妇、赤塔共青团委代表和赤塔社会福利局局长等都在边境上的车站等着我。苏联友人这种热情，使我这个生长在中国边疆、从未出过国的女孩子，感到无限的温暖。还没等我走下车，洛玛诺夫同志就把我紧紧地抱着，像父亲那样吻我。一进车站休息室，他就急忙问我伤口长的怎样，并且说因为不知道我的伤口是不是长好了，已经焦急的好多天没有睡好觉了。接着，他又赶忙安慰我说：“你放心，你放心，一切都会很好，苏联人民将尽一切力量帮助你，让你恢复工作能力。”
    到赤塔第二天一大早，工厂就派人来量尺寸，给我做防寒的皮手套和第一副工作手。这是带螺丝的和不带螺丝的套袖。这种套袖能夹住各种用具，能够使我自己吃饭，写字，刷牙，梳头，还能做针线。后来又送来一副工作手，这是套在肘上的皮套，能夹住许多种工具，像锯子、斧子、锤子等，用它能干重活，使我重新获得了劳动的能力。当我看到自己又能够梳头、能够劳动、甚至写字的时候，我是多么高兴！在那一霎间，我忍不住掉下眼泪，仿佛我是世界上最幸福的人了。第三副美容手，做的真是精致，猛一看和真手几乎没有差别，颜色红润，手皮上还有很自然的皱纹。我相信苏联同志为了帮助我，一定花费了不少心血，可是洛玛诺夫同志从来不肯把这个情况讲给我听。他只在最后告诉我们有多少人参加了这项工作。
    苏联人民，对于中国人民都有着深厚的友谊。我在赤塔旅社住着，每天都有人来访问，邀请我去联欢，或者到他们家里去作客。我在旅馆里吃饭，常常有人悄悄地打开门，专门来说一声“祝你幸福”、“祝你吃好饭”；走到大街上，迎面走来的苏联朋友也要说声“祝你幸福”！这次坐莫斯科——北京列车回来，同车的许多苏联朋友在报纸上看到过我的照片。一位来中国工作的苏联专家发现我以后，就陪着他的夫人来看我。他不住口地对我说：“你是好样的，好样的。希望你永远保持你那种英勇的精神。”
    在苏联那些天，洛玛诺夫同志那样忙，每天还要来看我两三次，每天教我学会一两样动作。每当我学会一样动作，他就把我紧紧抱起来摇着，拍打着，高兴地连连说：“赫洛少！赫洛少！”（好！好！）1月17日那天，洛玛诺夫同志举行家宴招待我。在这次宴会上，社会福利局局长看到我能够自己动手吃饭，也高兴的不得了：“这太好了，这不仅是中国人民的喜事，也是我们苏联人的大喜事，我们每一个人都为你高兴！”在宴会上，洛玛诺夫同志说：“我真希望有你这样一个女儿。”我也感动地说：“我也希望有你这样的一位父亲。”这时候全体吃饭的人一起举杯，为洛玛诺夫一家添了一个中国女儿干杯。洛玛诺夫同志的岳母给我们准备了很多好吃的东西。我请老奶奶干杯，她说：“我从来没喝过酒，今天我很感动，很高兴。好，我来喝一杯！”
    十九天并不算长，可是我从苏联人民身上学到了多少东西！他们那种勇敢、坚毅和革命的乐观主义精神，给我增加了巨大的力量。我在赤塔盲人工厂看到了一个苏联同志。这个同志双目失明了，还少了一只右手；可是装了假手，学成了一个很好的木工。洛玛诺夫同志本人，就是一个很好的榜样。他已经五十多岁了，可是他是那么乐观，活泼。他常说，我还是个青年人呢。
    洛玛诺夫同志一方面给我安装假手，一方面不断给我鼓励。在我第一次学会自己吃饭、写字的时候，我连忙高兴地问他能不能穿衣服，能不能梳头，能不能这样，能不能那样。他认真地说：“只要你有坚强的毅力，都可以做。”我一直记住他说的话。以后，当我一有畏缩、害羞的情绪的时候，一想起他的话，勇气就来了。
    当我快要离开赤塔的时候，我的心情总是不能平静。离开的那天傍晚，赤塔州后贝加尔电台要我讲话。我真想把我整个的心捧出来，向伟大的苏联人民致意。我讲了这么几句话：“在即将离开美丽的赤塔市的时候，请允许我再一次向你们表示衷心的感谢。你们对我的深切关怀和无微不至的照顾，表现了苏联人民的崇高的国际主义精神和对中国人民的深厚友谊。友谊的手，给了我终身的力量。我一定加倍努力，积极工作，决不辜负苏联人民对我的热情的期望。”
    现在我已经回到亲爱的祖国了，可是在苏联所经过的一切，却还深深地铭刻在我心里。我一定要用苏联人民为我安装的这一双手，这一双中苏友谊之手，更好地为祖国的社会主义建设，为不断地发展和巩固中苏友谊，贡献出自己的一切！（附图片）
