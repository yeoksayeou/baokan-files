	Overnight Stay at Huoshaoping
	Xu Lizhong

	Huoshaoping is located on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi provinces, 1,500 meters above sea level, and is the watershed between the two provinces. For hundreds of miles around, there are no inhabitants. At the summit, there is a lawn that can accommodate more than a thousand people. In 1932, the Kuomintang reactionaries launched several brutal "encirclement and suppression" campaigns against the Fujian-Jiangxi border region. A guerrilla detachment of our Workers' and Peasants' Red Army fought in the Huoshaoping area. The enemy besieged them for more than a month and attacked many times, but failed to take the mountain. In the end, they had no choice but to set the mountain on fire. The raging flames lit up half the sky. Women cried, children screamed, and everyone cursed the White bandits for their inhumanity. The guerrilla队 cut a firebreak around their base and fought hard to put out the fire. After a tense battle, they finally escaped the danger. The fire burned for three days and three nights, but did not burn a single hair on the Red Army.

	Later, people called this mountain Huoshaoping (Burnt Flat).

	Our surveying team received the task of conducting surveys in the Huoshaoping area. We hired an old farmer to guide us. The old farmer's surname was Que, and he was a guerrilla隊 member in his early years, so he was familiar with the mountains and forests in this area.

	We set off, with the old man leading the way. He carried a pole, with rice on one end and a small steel pot on the other. On the old man's pole, there was also a tattered raincoat. He said that this raincoat had been with him for more than ten years of guerrilla warfare and could shield him from wind and rain. As he walked, he told us revolutionary stories.

	After crossing many mountains, streams and valleys, we finally emerged from a primeval forest. After walking along many rugged mountain roads, we finally climbed Huoshaoping. Huoshaoping—what a wonderful place! Looking around, the mountains rose and fell, and white clouds swirled around us. It was truly refreshing! We admired the view for a while, then set up our instruments and began to work. The old man sat down quietly and smoked his pipe.

	In the evening, the old man cut down a few mao bamboo poles, gathered some thatch, and built a thatched shed in a gully. He also spread a thick layer of dry thatch on the ground. This was our temporary accommodation. When we came back from work, we sat inside, and it was so soft and comfortable! Someone praised the old man. At this time, I felt excited and proud, because since the Red Army had stationed here, we were the first "travelers" on Huoshaoping.

	The old man came with a pot of rice and a bowl of fried peppers. The rice was very fragrant. Everyone sat around on the grass, chatting and laughing, and enjoyed a delicious picnic before going to bed.

	In the middle of the night, the weather suddenly turned cold, and I was awakened from my sleep by the chill. Outside, the wind howled, and the cold wind was biting. I couldn't help but lean closer to the old man sleeping next to me and shrink back. The old man woke up. As if he noticed that I was cold, he quietly put the raincoat he was covering himself with over me. I didn't move, and when he fell asleep again, I gently returned the raincoat to him. But the old man woke up again. He turned over, turned his face to me, and said softly, "Cover yourself with it! Don't catch a cold, I brought a cotton-padded coat..." As he spoke, he put the raincoat over me again. Although this raincoat was very old, it was so warm!

	The cold intensified, and many people were awakened by the cold. Some put on their clothes and sat up, while others went to light a fire to keep warm. Later, everyone got up and gathered around the fire. At this time, someone suggested asking the old man to tell revolutionary stories. He shook his head and said, "I've told them all! There aren't that many stories!"

	"Uncle is tired enough today, we should let him rest," someone said.

	"I'm not tired, I'm very happy today! I didn't expect that someone like me, who is almost buried in the ground, would have the opportunity to come to Huoshaoping again today." The old man knocked the ashes out of his pipe and said, "That was in 1932, the first time I came to Huoshaoping, also to deliver rice to people, but that time it was to deliver it to the Red Army. At that time, it was really not easy to send rice up the mountain! You couldn't use baskets or bags to carry it. Do you know what we used to pack it in?" He cast an inquiring look at us. We couldn't answer for a while. He smiled and said, "We came up with a good idea, using a long mao bamboo pole, punching through the joints, and then filling it with rice, carrying it on our shoulders. That's how we got past the White bandits' eyes and sent the rice up the mountain..."

	Finally, the old man sighed and said, "Today, it's so much easier for me to send rice to you! I put the rice in a basket, carrying a small steel pot, 'clang, clang' all the way up the mountain. Tell me, aren't these two different worlds! Haha!"

	I continued, "Uncle, the first time you delivered rice was to win the country, and this time you're delivering rice to build socialism!"

	"Yes!" the old man interjected, "Only under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao can there be such great changes! Only then can we have such a good world!"

	At this time, I suddenly felt that the cold wind blowing in my face seemed to be carrying the warmth of spring. I seemed to see factories springing up on Huoshaoping, buildings rising up... Huoshaoping, today we are surveying and designing for you, and in the future, this beautiful picture will become a reality.

    夜宿火烧坪
    徐立忠
    火烧坪位于闽赣边境，拔海一千五百米，是闽赣两省的分水岭。这里周围数百里没有人烟，顶上，有个能容一千多人的草坪。1932年，国民党反动派向闽赣边区进行了数次残酷的“围剿”，我工农红军有一支游击队转战在火烧坪一带，敌人围困了一个多月，进攻了许多次，都没有攻上山去。最后他们没有办法，便放火烧山。熊熊的火光，映红了半边天，女人哭，孩子叫，人人都咒骂白匪惨无人道。游击队一面在驻地的周围砍开一条火路，一面奋力扑火，经过一场紧张的战斗，终于摆脱了危险。烈火烧了三天三夜，没有烧到红军一根汗毛。
    后来，人们就喊这山叫作火烧坪。
    我们勘测队接到要到火烧坪一带进行勘测的任务。我们请了个老农带路，这老农姓阙，早年是个游击队员，对这一带山林很熟悉。
    出发了，老头在前面领路，他挑着个担子，一头是米，一头是个小钢锅。在老头的担子上，还有一件破旧的棕衣。他说这件棕衣跟他打了十多年游击，带着他可以遮避风雨。他一面走着，一面讲革命故事给我们听。
    翻过许多山岭，穿过许多溪涧和峡谷，我们才走出了一片原始森林。又走过了许多崎岖的山路，才登上了火烧坪，火烧坪——这是个多么好的地方啊。环视四周，群山起伏，白云缭绕，真是令人心旷神怡！我们欣赏了一会，便摆仪器，开始工作，老头也坐下来静静地吸烟。
    傍晚，老头砍了几根毛竹来，割了些茅草，在一个山窝子里搭好了一个草篷，地上还铺了厚厚一层干茅草，这就是我们临时的住宿处。我们收工回来，往里面一坐，软绵绵的，好舒服呵！有人称赞起老头来。这时，我心里只感到一阵兴奋和自豪，因为从红军驻过以后，我们是火烧坪上的第一批“旅客”。
    老头端着一锅子饭来了，还有一碗炒辣椒。饭很香，大家围坐在草地上，有说有笑，美美的吃了一顿野餐，然后睡觉。
    半夜，天气突然转冷，我在睡梦中被寒气冻醒了。外面风声呼呼，寒风袭人；我不禁向睡在身边的老头靠了靠，缩了缩身子。老头醒来了，他像是发现了我怕冷，就把盖在自己身上的一件棕衣悄悄地盖在我身上。我一动也不动，等他睡去了，又轻轻地把棕衣还给他。可是老头却又醒来了，他翻了一个身，把脸转过来，轻声地说：“盖着吧！别受凉，我带了棉衣来……”说着又把棕衣盖到我身上。这棕衣虽很破旧了，然而却那么暖和！
    寒气逐渐加重，许多人都冻醒了，有的穿了衣服坐起来，有的就去烧火取暖，后来大家都起来围到火堆边上去了。这时，有人提议要请老头讲革命故事，他摇摇头说：“讲完啦！哪有这么多故事？”
    “老伯今天够累啦，也该让人家歇歇气。”有人这样说。
    “累倒不累，今天我心里可也很乐呵！想不到我这个半截快进泥土的人，今天也有机会再来火烧坪。”老头敲了敲烟灰，说：“那是1932年，我第一次来火烧坪，也是给人送米，不过那次是给红军送的。那时节，送点米上山可真不容易啊！不能用箩挑，也不能用袋装，你们可知道我们是用什么装咯？”他向我们投出询问的眼光，我们一时都答不上来。他笑了笑说：“我们可想出了个好办法，用一根老长的毛竹，把节打穿，然后把米装进去，扛着走。就这样混过了白匪的狗眼，把米送上山去……”。
    最后，老头感叹地说：“今天我给你们送米可好啦！把米装在箩里，挑着小钢锅，‘哐啷哐啷’一直响着挑上山来。你说说，这不是两个世界吗！哈哈！”
    我接着说：“老伯，你头一回送米是为了打天下，这一回送米是为了建设社会主义啊！”
    “是呀！”老头接口说：“只有在党和毛主席的领导下，才有这个大变化！才有这个好世道！”
    这时，我突然感到迎面吹来的寒风好像都带着温暖的春意。我仿佛看到火烧坪上，涌出了一座座工厂，涌出了一幢幢楼房……火烧坪啊，今天我们在为你勘探设计，将来这美好的图景就会成为现实。
