Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: Arab Republic United Arab Republic Ambassador to China, Tarazi, held a reception tonight to celebrate the second anniversary of the founding of the United Arab Republic.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian attended the reception and spoke at the reception. He extended sincere congratulations to the government and people of the United Arab Republic on behalf of the Chinese government and people.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian said that although China and the UAR are geographically far apart, the people of the two countries have a deep traditional friendship. Since the Bandung Conference, our two countries have established good relations. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference have become the guidelines for developing relations between our two countries. The friendly relations developed between the two countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit not only conform to the wishes and interests of the Chinese and Arab people, but also to the wishes and interests of the people of Asian, African and other countries in the world. The Chinese government has always made unremitting efforts to develop this friendly relationship in the past.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian said that we are pleased to see that in the past year the Arab and African people have achieved great victories in their struggle for and in defense of national independence. Colonialism is facing a total collapse there. The Chinese people will, together with the people of the world, continue to firmly support the struggle of the Arab and African people for and in defense of national independence. At present, colonialism and imperialism are creating new conspiracies there in order to carry out dying struggles and new aggression, attempting to undermine the rising national independence movement, but it is certain that these conspiracies are doomed to failure.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian said that in the past year, the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Arab and African countries have been further developed, and the friendly exchanges between the Chinese people and the Arab and African people have become increasingly frequent. The strengthening of this friendly relationship and exchange has greatly increased our strength in the struggle for and in defense of national independence, and is conducive to consolidating the cause of Asian-African and world peace. However, imperialism is extremely hostile to the development of friendly relations between China and Arab and African countries, and they are doing everything possible to sabotage them. But we firmly believe that the friendship between the Chinese people and the Arab and African people, forged in the long-term common struggle against imperialism and for national independence, is unbreakable by any force. The imperialists' provocative conspiracies will not succeed.

Tonight, Vice Premier of the State Council Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo and Huang Yanpei, President of the Supreme People's Court Xie Juezai, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Bao Erhan, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, and others attended the reception.

Ambassador Tarazi spoke at the beginning of the reception. He said that our engagement in construction work does not prevent us from contributing to the creation of lasting peace and a world full of justice and confidence. It is for this reason that we refuse to participate in any kind of military treaty or group. In foreign policy, we are inspired by the Bandung Spirit and are sworn to the great Bandung Principles, which constitute a valuable guarantee of world peace.

The Ambassador said that the United Arab Republic will continue to hold high the torch of Arab nationalism and strive for Arab unity and Asian-African unity. It believes that as long as the aggressors still occupy some Arab territories, it will not stop the struggle against imperialism. It cannot ignore the bloody massacres suffered by the brave Algerian people. The Algerian people's struggle for self-determination has won the support and sympathy of the whole world. We will always support the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and resolutely support them until justice prevails in this Arab country.

The Ambassador said that in our struggle for freedom, we have received the support of many friendly countries. In the different stages of our struggle, the Chinese people have given us valuable support, for which our people are extremely grateful. Our people watch with admiration and respect the miraculous progress and tremendous constructive efforts made by the People's Republic of China in building a great country.

The Ambassador concluded by saying that we are very pleased to see that the friendly relations between the Arab people and the Chinese people are growing and developing along the lines set by Asian and African countries in Bandung. We believe that the unity of Asian and African countries is a cornerstone of world peace.

Also present at tonight's reception were people from all walks of life in China, as well as envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries to China.

    李先念副总理在阿联大使举行的国庆招待会上说
    中国支持阿拉伯和非洲人民反帝斗争
    塔拉齐大使表示相信亚非国家的团结是世界和平的一块基石
    新华社22日讯　阿拉伯联合共和国驻中国大使塔拉齐今晚举行招待会，庆祝阿拉伯联合共和国成立二周年。
    李先念副总理出席了招待会并且在招待会上讲了话。他代表中国政府和人民向阿拉伯联合共和国政府和人民致以诚挚的祝贺。
    李先念副总理说，中国和阿联虽然在地理上相隔很远，但是两国人民有着深厚的传统友谊。在万隆会议以后，我们两国建立了良好的关系。和平共处五项原则和万隆会议十项原则已经成为发展我们两国关系的准则。两国在和平共处五项原则、万隆精神的基础上发展起来的友好关系，不仅符合中阿两国人民的愿望和利益，而且也符合亚非国家以及世界各国人民的愿望和利益，中国政府过去一直在为发展这种友好关系而作着不懈的努力。
    李先念副总理说，我们高兴地看到过去一年来阿拉伯人民和非洲人民在争取和维护民族独立的斗争中，获得了巨大的胜利。殖民主义在那里正面临着全面崩溃的命运。中国人民将同世界人民一起继续坚决支持阿拉伯和非洲人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争。目前殖民主义和帝国主义为了进行垂死的挣扎和进行新的侵略，正在那里制造新阴谋，企图破坏日益高涨的民族独立运动，但是可以肯定，这些阴谋是注定要失败的。
    李先念副总理说，一年来，中国同阿拉伯和非洲国家的友好合作关系得到了新的发展，中国同阿拉伯和非洲人民之间的友好来往也日益频繁，这种友好关系和来往的加强，大大增进了我们争取和维护民族独立斗争的力量，并有助于巩固亚非和世界和平的事业。但是，帝国主义对中国同阿拉伯国家和非洲国家之间友好关系的发展是极端仇视的，他们正在千方百计的进行破坏。可是我们深信，中国人民同阿拉伯和非洲人民在长期共同反对帝国主义、争取民族独立斗争中结成的休戚与共的友谊关系是任何力量不能破坏的。帝国主义的挑拨阴谋，是不能得逞的。
    今晚，国务院副总理习仲勋，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长郭沫若、黄炎培，最高人民法院院长谢觉哉，政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉，外交部副部长章汉夫等，都出席了招待会。
    塔拉齐大使在招待会开始的时候讲话。他说，我们从事建设工作并不妨碍我们为缔造持久和平和一个富有正义和信心的世界而贡献一分力量。正是这个原因，我们拒绝参加任何种类的军事条约和集团。在对外政策方面，我们为万隆精神所鼓舞，并且誓忠于伟大的构成世界和平的可贵保证的万隆原则。
    大使说，阿拉伯联合共和国将继续高举阿拉伯民族主义的火炬，为阿拉伯团结和亚非团结而奋斗。它相信，只要侵略者仍然占据着阿拉伯的某些领土，它就不会停止反对帝国主义的斗争。它不能够对勇敢的阿尔及利亚人民所遭受的血腥屠杀置之不理。阿尔及利亚人民争取自决的斗争赢得了全世界的支持和同情。我们将永远支持巴勒斯坦人民的合法权利，并且坚决地声援他们，直到公理在这个阿拉伯国家取得胜利为止。
    大使说，在我们争取自由的斗争中，我们曾得到许多友好国家的支持。在我们斗争的不同阶段中，中国人民曾给予我们宝贵的支援，我国人民对此极为感激。我国人民以钦佩和尊敬的心情注视着中华人民共和国在建设伟大国家中的奇迹般的进展和巨大的建设性的努力。
    大使最后说，我们很高兴地看到阿拉伯人民和中国人民之间的友好关系正在沿着亚非国家在万隆所制定的路线日益增长和发展。我们相信，亚非国家的团结是世界和平的一块基石。
    出席今晚招待会的，还有中国各方面的人士，以及各国驻中国的使节和外交官员。
