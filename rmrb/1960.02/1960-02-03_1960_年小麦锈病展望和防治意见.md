1960 Wheat Rust Disease Outlook and Prevention Recommendations
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Plant Protection

In 1959, wheat seedling rust diseases (referring to winter wheat sown in the autumn of that year) occurred in fourteen provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China. The affected area and severity both exceeded those of 1958.

1960 Rust Disease Situation Outlook

In order to strengthen wheat rust disease prevention and control work, we have analyzed the epidemic factors of the three types of rust diseases in China based on the information we have and put forward the 1960 rust disease occurrence outlook for relevant departments to refer to.

Stripe Rust

In the main winter wheat areas of China, the main factors constituting stripe rust epidemics are two:

	① Autumn seedlings are universally infected, the overwintering rate of the pathogens is high, and there is a certain amount of local inoculum source in early spring.

	② The rainfall is high in March, April, and May in spring, and the number of rainy days is large. Under normal temperatures, the requirements for stripe rust fungus to invade and develop can be met.

Taking the Beijing area as an example, in 1949, early-sown autumn seedlings reached a stripe rust incidence rate of 25% in mid-November. Because the winter temperature that year was significantly higher than normal, the overwintering rate of the pathogens was very high, and the incidence rate in late March still reached 1% (most of the pathogens were killed by freezing after overwintering; under normal circumstances, the incidence rate is less than 1%). In addition, the rainfall in April was very large, exceeding the normal amount by 95.3 mm, promoting the development of the disease, resulting in a large-scale epidemic. However, the dominant factors causing stripe rust epidemics are not necessarily exactly the same in each region. For example, in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province and the central and southern parts of North China (south of the Shijiazhuang-Dezhou line to Jiexiu, Shanxi), the winter is warmer, and the average and minimum temperatures in January are -4°C and -8°C respectively, so the overwintering rate of stripe rust fungus is higher. In the area north of the Shijiazhuang-Dezhou line to Jiexiu, Shanxi, the average and minimum temperatures in January are -4°C to -8°C and -8°C to -13°C respectively, so the overwintering rate of pathogens is lower, but the overwintering rate is also higher in cases of large autumn inoculum, high winter temperatures, or long-term snow cover. After overwintering, as long as the rainfall is high, the soil moisture is high, and the leaf surface is often dewed, stripe rust will quickly become epidemic. For example, the Guanzhong Plain almost always has a considerable amount of overwintering pathogens, and coupled with frequent spring rains, stripe rust is often epidemic. In northern North China, stripe rust rarely occurs on autumn seedlings in recent years because the frequency of epidemics is lower due to the limitations of low winter temperatures and spring drought.

According to the aforementioned rules and the current degree of disease incidence in wheat seedlings, and referring to the 1960 meteorological outlook materials, it can be roughly predicted that stripe rust will have a large-scale epidemic this year in Guanzhong, Shaanxi, western Henan, southern Shanxi, eastern Gansu, and northern Xinjiang. This is because the temperature in the above areas from March to May is suitable for the development of stripe rust, and there will also be more rainfall this year. For example, the rainfall in southern Shanxi in April increased by 38.6 mm compared with the same period in 1959, and the rainfall in Guanzhong in April was 53 mm more than in the same period in 1959.

Wheat autumn seedlings in central Shanxi had very little disease incidence. The rainfall from March to May 1960 was less than in the same period in 1959. In western and eastern Shandong and in a few plots in southern Hebei, autumn seedlings had relatively severe disease incidence, but the spring was very dry, with only 21 to 40 mm of rainfall from March to early May. Based on this, it is estimated that stripe rust may be relatively light in the above areas. It should be pointed out that in vast wheat-growing areas such as Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, and northern Anhui, similar to Guanzhong, Shaanxi, the "Bima No. 1" wheat variety occupies a large area. In recent years, this variety has lost its resistance to stripe rust. According to the trend of stripe rust developing from west to east in 1959 and the consistency of physiological race types, the inoculum source in spring in the above areas is likely to be related to the inoculum source in Shaanxi and Gansu. It is estimated that after stripe rust becomes epidemic in Shaanxi and Gansu, a large number of pathogen spores may be spread eastward. In the past two years, the irrigated area of wheat fields in various parts of China has expanded rapidly, and the soil moisture in wheat fields has generally increased, largely offsetting the effect of spring drought limiting the development of rust fungi. The amount of fertilizer applied in various places has also increased compared with the past. With abundant water and fertilizer, the wheat plants grow luxuriantly and have tender tissues, which is also beneficial to the infection of rust fungi. Analyzing these aspects together, stripe rust may also have a certain degree of epidemic in the later stages of wheat growth in areas such as Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, and northern Anhui, where there is very little overwintering inoculum or little rainfall in spring. Therefore, vigilance cannot be relaxed.

Leaf Rust

Central and northern North China: The spring is usually drier, and the total rainfall from March to May is generally below 70 mm. Leaf rust often occurs in autumn seedlings, but the overwintering rate is very low, and in the north, it is even completely killed by freezing. The overwintering rust fungi often develop very slowly due to the influence of spring drought, so this area is not a leaf rust epidemic area. Although autumn seedlings were severely infected in 1959, the winter temperature in 1960 was lower than normal, and the meteorological forecast for 1960 is for less spring rain (only 50 mm of rainfall from March to May), it is estimated that the disease incidence will not be severe.

Southern North China, northern and southern Anhui, and both banks of the Yangtze River: Because the winter temperature is higher, the overwintering rate of leaf rust fungus is higher. At the same time, there is more rainfall in spring, so the development speed and severity of rust diseases in this area will generally exceed the previous area. In the winter of 1959, the amount of leaf rust fungus on wheat autumn seedlings in southern North China, northern Anhui, and central and eastern Henan was relatively large. According to meteorological forecasts, the development of overwintering inoculum may be suppressed due to less spring rain this year, but if the temperature rises early in early spring, there may also be an epidemic.

Southwest China: The winter temperature is high, and there is more rainfall and humidity in spring, both of which can meet the requirements for leaf rust fungus to become epidemic. The key to the epidemic lies in the temperature in mid-to-late March and early April. If the temperature rises early, leaf rust may become epidemic.

Stem Rust

According to observations in Jiangsu and Anhui in 1956, 1958, and 1959, the period before and after wheat heading is the main period for the spring epidemic of stem rust. Before heading, wheat has stronger disease resistance, and the temperature is also lower, so the possibility of widespread disease incidence is not high. Data from Anhui Province for two years show that when the average temperature in mid-to-late April (including early May in northern Anhui) approaches or reaches above 17 to 18 degrees Celsius, and there is a large amount of external inoculum source, stem rust will occur rapidly.

In 1959, stem rust on autumn seedlings was more widespread in parts of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shandong than in previous years. However, from the perspective of meteorological factors during the key period in spring, the humidity in mid-April in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (southern Jiangsu, southern Anhui, southern Henan, northern Hubei, northern Zhejiang) is basically suitable for the occurrence of stem rust. According to meteorological forecasts, the temperature in late April this year is 2.5 degrees lower than in the same period in 1958, which is unfavorable for stem rust. The temperature in early and mid-May this year is 1 to 2 degrees higher than in 1958, and the rainfall has also increased, so it is estimated that if there is an inoculum source, stem rust will be severe in the later stages. The trend of occurrence in northern Anhui, with low temperature and little rain in late April, may be similar to that in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. In southern and southwestern Yunnan, stem rust on autumn seedlings is quite severe, but according to meteorological forecasts, rainfall from February to April 1960 will be lower, so it is estimated that there may be a moderate epidemic.

How to Prevent and Control Rust Diseases

To do a good job in preventing and controlling rust diseases, first of all, a strict prediction and forecasting network must be established to pay close attention to the rise and fall of local overwintering inoculum sources. When the ground thaws and wheat seedlings begin to turn green, a detailed general survey should be organized with early-sown fields as the focus. For stripe rust, after diseased leaves are found, the experience of burying and cutting leaves in Shaanxi Province should be immediately adopted. Use a shovel to cover the diseased leaves with soil, then cut them off from the base of the diseased leaves, and remove the wheat leaves within one to one and a half feet around. If a transmission center is found, the diseased leaves can be buried and cut off, and the wheat leaves within three feet around can be removed. The purpose of removing wheat leaves is to eliminate pathogens that are latent inside the wheat leaves but have not yet shown symptoms, so that a more thorough prevention and control effect can be achieved. After the first prevention and control, carry out continuous prevention and control once every three to four days, for a total of three to four times, to eliminate all the pathogens that have overwintered or compress them to the minimum limit. Decide whether it is necessary to carry out universal chemical control based on the development of residual pathogens. Spraying should start before the pathogens have spread widely, so that the spread of early inoculum sources can be controlled, and their reproduction and large-scale accumulation can be delayed and reduced, thereby more effectively delaying the period of widespread occurrence. If spraying is done too late, because the number of diseased individuals in the field is already large, especially the amount of latent inoculum is also high, the prevention and control effect will be poor. For leaf rust, because the initial manifestation in the field is not as obvious as stripe rust, it is not advisable to use the method of burying and cutting leaves. In North China and Northwest China, if the amount of overwintering leaf rust fungus is large, there is a lot of spring rain, and the temperature rises early, and the development speed after the pathogens are renewed is fast, chemical control needs to be carried out. In northern Anhui, it can generally be combined with the prevention and control of stem rust. If necessary, prevention and control must be carried out in advance based on the development situation in early spring. In the southwestern region, where leaf rust is often epidemic, it is even more necessary to carry out chemical control in a timely manner.

According to existing conditions, sulfur preparations must still be the main agents used on a large scale in 1960. In order to facilitate preparation and use, it is best to make sulfur into barium polysulfide or colloidal sulfur. Strict identification should be carried out on the specifications of the manufactured products to avoid quality failing to meet the requirements and failing to achieve the expected results after use. Special attention should be paid to moisture protection when storing barium polysulfide to avoid rapid failure. In order to save sulfur, the mixed use of lime-sulfur mixture and various indigenous pesticides can be promoted. Indigenous pesticides with higher effects, such as tea cake and lycoris radiata, can also be used alone.

Regardless of whether it is stripe rust or leaf rust, early-sown fields and low-lying areas should be the first to be targeted for prevention and control, because these places are the origin of pathogens in spring. Timely and thorough prevention and control, without allowing pathogens to multiply and accumulate in large numbers, can greatly reduce the number of spores spreading to the surrounding and farther distances, thereby delaying the time of stripe rust occurrence on a large area.

For stem rust, if it starts to occur before and after wheat heading, or airborne spores are continuously found, spraying should be started for prevention and control.

The predictions made in this article are estimates made on the premise that there is no snow cover. If the snow cover time is very long and the snow layer is very thick, the amount of overwintering should be estimated higher.

Due to the different situations in various places regarding the rust disease incidence of autumn seedlings, some have conducted comprehensive and careful inspections, while others may have only made relatively rough observations. In the latter area, in order to make the estimate as close to reality as possible, it is necessary to further grasp the number of local inoculum sources.

In addition, the rust disease situation outlook largely depends on the meteorological outlook. If the long-term meteorological forecast is revised, the rust disease situation outlook should also be revised accordingly.

    1960年小麦锈病展望和防治意见
    中国农业科学院植物保护研究所
    1959年小麦秋苗（即当年秋季播种的冬小麦）发生锈病的地区有十四个省、市、自治区，发生的面积和严重的程度都超过1958年。
    1960年锈病情况展望
    为了加强小麦锈病防治工作，我们根据掌握的资料，对我国三种锈病的流行因素作如下分析，并提出1960年锈病发生的展望，供有关部门参考。
    条锈病
    在我国主要冬麦地区，构成条锈病流行的主要因素有二：
    ①秋苗发病普遍，病菌越冬率高，早春拥有一定数量的当地菌源。
    ②春季3、4、5月的雨量大，降雨日数多，在正常的气温下，能够满足条锈菌侵入和发展的要求。
    以北京地区为例，1949年早播秋苗在11月中旬条锈病发病率达到25％，由于当年冬季气温显著高于常年，病菌越冬率很高，3月下旬发病率还达1％（病菌越冬后大部被冻死，在一般情况下，发病率低于1％），加以4月雨量很大，超出常年九十五点三毫米，促进了病势的发展，以致造成大流行。但是，各个地区造成条锈病流行的主导因素不一定完全相同。例如陕西省关中地区、华北中南部（石德线至山西介休一线以南），由于冬季较暖，1月份平均和最低气温分别为摄氏零下四度和零下八度，条锈菌越冬率因此较高；石德线至山西介休一线以北地区，1月份平均和最低气温分别为摄氏零下四度至零下八度和零下八度至零下十三度，因此病菌越冬率较低，但在秋季菌量大、冬季气温高或长期积雪情况下，越冬率也较高。病菌越冬以后，只要降雨量大，土壤湿度较高，叶面经常结露，条锈病就会迅速流行。如关中平原几乎每年都有相当数量的越冬病菌，加以常年春雨较多，所以条锈病经常流行。华北北部，近年来条锈病在秋苗上很少发生，因为受冬季低温和春季干旱的限制，流行频率较低。
    根据前述规律及目前麦苗发病程度，参考1960年气象展望材料，大致可以预测，本年条锈病在陕西关中、河南西部、山西南部、甘肃东部、新疆北部将有较大的流行。因为以上地区3—5月温度适合条锈病发展，同时今年雨量较多。如山西南部4月份雨量较1959年同期增加三十八点六毫米，关中4月份雨量较1959年同期多五十三毫米。
    山西中部小麦秋苗发病很少，1960年3—5月雨量比1959年同期少；山东西部和东部、河北南部少数地块秋苗发病较重，但春季很干旱，3月至5月上旬仅降雨二十一至四十毫米；据此估计，以上地区条锈病发生可能比较轻。需要指出的是，河南、河北、山西、山东和淮北等广大麦区，与陕西关中一样，碧蚂1号小麦占据很大的面积，近年来，这一品种对条锈病已经丧失抵抗性。根据1959年条锈病自西向东发展的趋势，和生理小种类型的一致性，上述地区春季的菌源很可能与陕、甘地区的菌源有联系，估计陕西和甘肃等地条锈病流行后，有可能产生大量的病菌孢子向东传播。最近二年来，我国各地麦田灌溉面积迅速扩大，麦田土壤湿度普遍提高，在很大程度上抵消了春旱限制锈菌发展的作用。各地施肥量较过去增加，水多肥足，麦株生长茂盛，组织柔嫩，这种情况对锈菌的侵染也是有利的。把这几方面结合起来分析，河南、河北、山西、山东、淮北等越冬菌源很少或春季降雨量少的地区，在小麦生长的较晚阶段，条锈病也可能有一定程度的流行，因此不能放松警惕。
    叶锈病
    华北中北部：常年春季较旱，3—5月雨量总计一般在七十毫米以下。秋苗经常发生叶锈病，但越冬率很低，北部甚至全部冻死。越冬的锈菌，由于受春旱的影响也往往发展得很慢，所以这一带不是叶锈病流行区。1959年秋苗虽然发病严重，但1960年冬季温度低于常年，气象预报1960年春雨少（3—5月雨量仅五十毫米），估计发病不会严重。
    华北南部、淮北及淮南、长江两岸：因冬季气温较高，叶锈菌越冬率较高；同时春季雨量较多，因此，这一地区锈病发展速度和严重程度一般会超过前一地区。1959年冬，华北南部、淮北地区、河南的中部和东部小麦秋苗上叶锈菌的菌量较大，据气象预报由于今年春雨较少，越冬菌的发展可能受到一定抑制；但如果早春温度上升早，也有流行可能。
    西南区：冬季气温高，春季雨量多，湿度大，这两方面都能符合叶锈菌流行的要求。流行的关键在于3月中下旬和4月上旬的温度，如温度上升得早，叶锈病就可能流行。
    秆锈病
    据苏皖地区1956、1958、1959年的观察，小麦抽穗前后为秆锈病春季流行的主要时期。在抽穗以前，小麦抗病性较强，温度也较低，因此普遍发病的可能性不大。安徽省两年的资料说明，4月中下旬平均温度（淮北地区包括5月上旬）接近或达到摄氏十七到十八度以上，有大量外来菌源时，秆锈病就会迅速发生。
    1959年秋苗秆锈病在江苏、安徽、山东的部分地区，比历年发生普遍。但从春季关键时期的气象因子来看，长江中下游地区（苏南、皖南、淮南、鄂北、浙北）4月中旬湿度基本上适合秆锈病发生的要求。据气象预报，今年4月下旬比1958年同期温度低二点五度，这对秆锈病不利；今年5月上中旬温度较1958年高一至二度，降水量也有所增加，估计如有菌源，秆锈病将在后期严重。淮北地区4月下旬低温少雨，发生趋势可能与长江中下游相近。云南的南部和西南部，秋苗秆锈病相当严重，但据气象预报，1960年2至4月份降水偏低，估计可能有中度流行。
    怎样防治锈病
    要做好防治锈病工作，首先要建立严密的预测预报网，密切注意当地越冬菌源的消长。在地面开冻、麦苗开始返青的时节，就应当以早播田为重点，组织细致的普查。对于条锈病，在发现病叶后，应当立即采取陕西省埋土切叶的经验，用铲铲土将病叶埋盖，再从病叶基部将其切断，并摘除四周一至一尺半内的麦叶。如果发现传病中心，可将病叶埋切后，摘除周围三尺内的麦叶。摘除麦叶的目的，是消灭潜伏在麦叶内部尚未表现症状的病菌，这样可收到比较彻底的防治效果。第一次防治以后，每隔三至四天连续防治一次，共防治三至四次，把越过冬的病菌全部消灭或压缩至最低限度。根据残留病菌发展的情况，决定是否有必要进行普遍的药剂防治。开始喷药，应在病菌还没有普遍蔓延以前进行，这样可以控制早期菌源的传播，延缓和减少它们的繁殖和大量累积，从而能更有效的推迟普遍发生的时期；喷晚了，由于田间受病个体数量已较多，特别是潜育菌量也多了，防治的效果就较差。对于叶锈病，由于初期在田间表现不如条锈病明显，不宜采用埋土切叶的方法。在华北、西北等地如果叶锈菌越冬量较大，春雨多，气温上升早，病菌更新以后发展速度快，就需要开展药剂防治。在淮北地区，一般可以结合秆锈病进行防治，根据早春发展情况有必要时亦须提前防治。在叶锈病常流行的西南地区，更需要及时进行药剂防治。
    根据现有条件，1960年大面积上使用的药剂仍须以硫磺制剂为主。为了配制和使用方便，最好能将硫磺制成多硫化钡或胶体硫。对制成的药品的规格应进行严格的鉴定，以免质量不符要求，使用后达不到预期效果。在储存多硫化钡时应特别注意防湿，以免很快失效。为了节省硫磺，可提倡石硫合剂与各种土农药的混用。效果较高的土农药如茶饼、石蒜等也可以单独使用。
    不管是条锈病或叶锈病，防治时都应当首先抓早播地和低洼地，因为这些地方是春季病菌的发源地。防治及时、彻底，不让病菌大量繁殖和积累，可以大大的减少向四周和更远距离传播孢子的数量，从而延缓大面积上条锈病的发生时期。
    对于秆锈病，如果在小麦抽穗前后开始发生，或空中孢子连续发现，即应开始喷药防治。
    这篇文章所作的展望，对越冬量的预测都是指在不存在积雪的前提下所作的估计。如果积雪的时间很长，雪层很厚，越冬量应当估计得高一些。
    由于各地对于秋苗发生锈病掌握的情况不一，有的作过全面的仔细的检查，有的可能仅作了比较粗略的观察。在后一地区，为了使估计尽可能接近实际，就必须进一步掌握当地菌源的数量。
    此外，锈病病情展望在很大程度上决定于气象展望，如果气象长期预报有修正，则锈病病情展望也要相应地修订。
