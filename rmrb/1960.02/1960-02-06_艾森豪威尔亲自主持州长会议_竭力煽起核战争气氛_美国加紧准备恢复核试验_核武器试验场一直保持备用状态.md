Xinhua News Agency report: American officials have recently intensified their efforts to incite a domestic atmosphere of nuclear war and are preparing to test various types of nuclear weapons.

On January 25th, U.S. President Eisenhower personally presided over a meeting of the U.S. Governors' Conference at the White House. The purpose of the meeting was to study the question of "how the United States should deal with atomic particle damage" in the event of a nuclear war. This meeting is another measure by the U.S. ruling clique, which sings the praises of "peace," to step up war preparations at home.

The chairman of the U.S. Governors' Conference is the Governor of New York State, Nelson Rockefeller, a key member of the Rockefeller financial group.

U.S. Secretary of State Herter attended the meeting and delivered a speech entitled "The Relationship between the Threat of Particle Danger and Foreign Policy."

In his speech, Herter once again advocated that "seeking peace" requires strengthening "enormous military capabilities." He emphasized the extremely important role of the American "civil defense program" in the American military strength. He said that America's civil defense program, together with its "retaliatory capabilities," constitutes a "powerful deterrent force." He said he believes that any plan that could reduce particle danger could strengthen America's "defense posture" and "political and negotiating power."

In his speech, Herter indirectly admitted the weak position of the United States militarily. He said, "There is much talk about the Soviet Union's current and anticipated military capabilities." However, he used this to slander the Soviet Union for "hoping to use their powerful military position" to threaten the "free world." He vigorously advocated that the United States must negotiate with the Soviet Union from a position of strength. He said that in dealing with the "Communist world," the United States "must base itself on our own strong defense position."

Herter also stated that his view not only has "serious significance" for America's own military and diplomatic position, but also applies equally to its North Atlantic allies. He wanted these countries to recognize that "further progress needs to be made" in this regard and to "remain firm" in the face of the so-called "threat of aggression."

On January 30th, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission submitted an annual report to Congress. This annual report shows that the United States is vigorously developing various new nuclear weapons and is preparing to test these weapons.

The report said: The Atomic Energy Commission can begin testing new nuclear weapons quickly after receiving notice. The report said that since the United States decided to suspend nuclear testing between November 1, 1958, and December 30, 1959, the U.S. nuclear weapons test site in Nevada has remained on "standby."

### 艾森豪威尔亲自主持州长会议  竭力煽起核战争气氛  美国加紧准备恢复核试验  核武器试验场一直保持备用状态

    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国官方人士近来加紧煽起国内核战争气氛，并且准备试验各式核武器。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔1月25日亲自在白宫主持了美国的州长委员会会议，会议的目的是要研究在一旦发生核战争时美国应该“如何对付原子微粒伤害”的问题。这次会议是高唱“和平”的美国统治集团在国内加紧战争准备的又一个措施。
    美国州长委员会主席是纽约州州长、洛克菲勒财团主要成员纳尔逊·洛克菲勒。
    美国国务卿赫脱参加了这次会议，并且在会上发表了题为“微粒危险的威胁同对外政策的关系”的讲话。
    赫脱在讲话中再次鼓吹所谓“谋求和平”必须加强“巨大的军事能力”。他强调美国的“民防计划”在美国军事力量中的极为重要的作用。他说，美国的民防计划连同它的“报复能力”构成了一支“强大的威慑力量”。他说，他相信任何这种可能缩小微粒危险的计划都可以加强美国的“防务地位”和“政治和谈判力量”。
    赫脱在讲话中间接地承认美国在军事上所处的孱弱的地位。他说，“（美国）人们对苏联目前的和预料会有的军事能力谈得很多”。但是，他借此诬蔑苏联“希望以他们的强有力的军事地位”来威胁“自由世界”。他极力鼓吹美国必须从实力地位出发来同苏联进行谈判。他说，美国在同“共产主义世界”打交道中，“必须以我们自己的强有力的防务地位为基础”。
    赫脱还表示，他的这种意见不仅对美国自己的军事和外交地位有“严重意义”，而且也同样适用于它的北大西洋盟国。他要这些国家认识到在这方面“需要取得进一步的进展”，并在所谓“侵略威胁”面前，“保持坚定”。
    美国政府原子能委员会1月30日向国会提出了一个年度报告。这个年度报告表明美国正在大力发展各种各样新的核武器，并且准备试验这些武器。
    报告说：原子能委员会能够在接到通知后很快开始试验新的核武器。报告说，自从美国决定在1958年11月1日到1959年12月30日之间停止核试验以来，美国在内华达的核武器试验场一直保持“备用状态”。
