    Bring the Manure Accumulation Campaign to a New High Tide
    Currently, an urgent task in rural work is to further mobilize the masses and push the manure accumulation, fertilizer production, and fertilizer transportation campaign to a new high tide, to ensure that summer harvest crops have more topdressing fertilizer and spring-sown crops have sufficient base fertilizer.
    This year, agriculture must increase production of more grain, cotton, oil, and other agricultural products than in 1959. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously grasp the three basic measures of water, fertilizer, and soil. In the current situation, drought and flood prevention water conservancy projects need to be tightened, and fertilizer needs to be accelerated even more. The agricultural proverb says, "Whether there is a harvest or not depends on water, how much is harvested depends on fertilizer." This sentence vividly expresses the relationship between water, fertilizer, and increased agricultural production. At present, the winter manure accumulation work centered on pig raising has achieved great success. According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, as of January 21, the country had accumulated more than 170 billion dan of various fertilizers, and the quality was also relatively good. However, the development of this work is still very uneven. In the more advanced areas, each mu has accumulated more than one hundred dan or even several hundred dan, while in the weaker areas, each mu has only a dozen dan of fertilizer. Even in areas where more fertilizer has been accumulated, it is still necessary to continue accumulating and producing fertilizer. According to the experience of high-yield fields last year, Guangdong rice fields yielding 1,000 jin generally require 20 to 30 dan of human and animal manure, and about 120 to 130 dan of miscellaneous fertilizer. The high-yield experience of wheat in Meng County, Henan, where wheat yields 600 to 700 jin per mu, requires about 30 dan of human manure and urine, 80 dan of grass fertilizer, and 30 jin of chemical fertilizer per mu. This means that the fertilizer needed for one mu of high-yield field must be of good quality and large quantity. Now, calculated according to the national planting area, the average is only more than 80 dan of fertilizer per mu. Therefore, the urgent task at present is to immediately start vigorously grasping fertilizer production and prepare more fertilizer for the continued leap forward in agriculture this year.
    This year, many rural areas have established fertilizer bases, and at the same time, are vigorously launching mass movements to broadly expand fertilizer sources. This is the two-legged approach to fertilizer production. Implementing this approach can make fertilizer production more, faster, better, and more economical, in order to provide a full and reliable source of fertilizer for the continued leap forward in agriculture. The combination of establishing fertilizer bases and launching mass manure accumulation campaigns is a creation of the people's communes and a product of the great leap forward in agriculture, with unlimited vitality.
    Establishing fertilizer bases must first develop animal husbandry centered on pig raising. Since last winter, all parts of the country have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and have launched a high tide of pig raising and manure accumulation. The number of pigs has increased rapidly. According to recent statistics, people's communes, production teams, and public canteens across the country have established 2 million collective pig farms. These pig farms are also the most reliable bases for regularly and massively supplying high-quality fertilizer to crops. Other measures for establishing fertilizer bases are planting green manure and widely establishing local chemical fertilizer plants. Now, many people's communes have fertilizer production bases centered on pig farms, while also planting green manure and manufacturing local chemical fertilizers. Therefore, taking pig raising and manure accumulation as the main focus, implementing the three-way combination of raising, planting, and manufacturing, to better cultivate fertilizer sources and further utilize fertilizer sources, is an important way to solve the fertilizer problem in the future. These aspects of fertilizer resources are very abundant and have infinite potential; they can not only increase the quantity of fertilizer, but also rapidly improve the quality of fertilizer.
    While taking pig raising and manure accumulation as the main focus and establishing year-round fertilizer production bases, it is also necessary to broadly expand fertilizer sources and vigorously launch manure accumulation campaigns to accumulate and produce more natural fertilizers. At present, the work of establishing fertilizer bases has just begun, and it is not possible to supply a lot of fertilizer all at once. Taking pig raising as an example, the number of pigs is not yet large enough, and the manure in the pens cannot solve all the fertilizer needed by crops. The amount of green manure and chemical fertilizer is also not large. Therefore, on the one hand, we must vigorously carry out basic construction of fertilizer, ensuring a certain amount of fine fertilizer, and at the same time, we must, as in previous years, broadly open up fertilizer sources and accumulate and produce more miscellaneous fertilizer. This means that in terms of the manure accumulation campaign, we should implement the two-legged approach of simultaneously focusing on fine fertilizer and coarse fertilizer, simultaneously establishing fertilizer bases and broadly expanding fertilizer sources, and simultaneously conducting regular manure accumulation and shock manure accumulation. Facts have proven that only in this way can we meet the huge need for fertilizer for the continued leap forward in agriculture, and at the same time, we can comprehensively utilize various fertilizers and exert the different roles of different fertilizers. For example, river mud applied to sandy soil can improve the soil; bone ash contains a high amount of phosphorus and is suitable for application to phosphorus-deficient acidic soils.
    Natural fertilizers should be accumulated every year. Various substances in nature decompose and rot every day. It can also be said that nature is making various organic and inorganic fertilizers every day. For example, the soil of kang [heated brick bed] can be changed every year, river mud can be dug every year, and garbage is available every day. The masses often say, "Water flows endlessly, fertilizer accumulates endlessly," which is the truth. As long as the masses are fully mobilized, everyone starts working, and every household accumulates fertilizer, it will definitely be possible to achieve: household fertilizer goes out, wild fertilizer returns to the fields, mountain fertilizer goes down the mountain, and river and sea fertilizer goes ashore.
    What if there is a shortage of labor in accumulating, producing, and transporting fertilizer? Now it seems that this problem is not difficult to solve. More than 3.1 million water conservancy projects have been completed nationwide (accounting for more than two-thirds of all projects). Apart from those that still need to continue construction and those "dead corners" of water conservancy construction that still need to be eliminated, a large number of laborers can be immediately transferred to the manure accumulation front. Many places have already done so. After the spring plowing preparation work enters a tense stage, it is also necessary to transfer more labor to engage in manure accumulation and fertilizer production work. At the same time, vigorously carrying out tool reform is also an important way to solve the shortage of labor. Many places have quickly shifted the tool reform and technological innovation movement in water conservancy construction sites to technological innovation in manure accumulation and fertilizer transportation, greatly improving work efficiency. Rugui County, Hunan, vigorously carried out tool reform in the manure accumulation campaign. The county's 48,000-strong manure accumulation army accumulated an average of 102 dan of fertilizer per person per day, saving 4.06 million workdays. All localities should carefully summarize and promote experience in this area, and also launch a high-efficiency movement in manure accumulation and fertilizer transportation. Even water conservancy construction sites that have not been completed can combine water conservancy construction with manure accumulation. Dongtian Commune in Nan'an County, Fujian Province, in the course of vigorously carrying out water conservancy movements, adopted the method of "picking up sheep along the way," combining the cleaning of foundations, removing turf, digging ponds, and digging ditch mud in water conservancy projects, and accumulated more than 1.77 million dan of fertilizer, resulting in a double leap forward in water conservancy and manure accumulation.
    Now the masses in many places have taken action, and a high tide of accumulating, producing, and transporting fertilizer is rising. A folk song vividly reflects the masses' enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer: "Production leaps forward even more, the fields are fertile and people are even more diligent. Accumulating fertilizer is like accumulating grain, one dan is worth a thousand gold." The problem now lies in further strengthening leadership, giving full play to the enthusiasm of the masses, quickly solving various specific problems, taking concrete and effective measures, and launching a widespread manure accumulation movement, racing against time.
    While accumulating more fertilizer and good fertilizer, we should also advocate accumulating and transporting fertilizer at the same time, accumulating quickly and transporting quickly. In the past, many areas accumulated a large amount of fertilizer in winter and then rushed to transport it in the spring, resulting in delays in production. This year, all localities should launch a high tide of fertilizer transportation while accumulating fertilizer, striving to deliver all the topdressing fertilizer used for wheat and the fertilizer needed for spring plowing and sowing to the fields before and after the Beginning of Spring [one of the 24 solar terms]. Spring sowing has not yet begun, but fertilizer comes first. With fertilizer in the fields, we have a number in our hearts. In this way, the broad masses of commune members in the people's communes can free up their hands and do a more detailed and better job of this year's spring plowing and sowing and wheat field management.

    把积肥运动引向新高潮
    当前，农村工作的一项迫切任务，就是进一步发动群众，把积肥、造肥、运肥运动推向新的高潮，保证夏收作物有更多的追肥，春播作物有足够的基肥。
    今年农业要比1959年增产更多的粮食、棉花、油料和其他农产品。因此，必须大抓水、肥、土三项基本措施。在目前情况下，防旱防涝的水利工程需要抓紧，肥料更需要快马加鞭。农谚说：“有收无收在于水，收多收少在于肥”，这句话生动地道出了水、肥和农业增产的相互关系。目前，以养猪为中心的冬季积肥工作获得了很大的成绩。据农业部统计，截至1月21日止，全国已积各种肥料一千七百多亿担，质量也比较好。但是这个工作的发展还很不平衡。工作比较先进的地区每亩已积一百多担以至几百担，而工作薄弱的地区每亩还只有十几担肥料。就是肥料积得较多的地区，也还须要继续积肥造肥。按照去年丰产田的经验，广东水稻千斤田一般需人畜粪二、三十担，杂肥一百二、三十担左右。河南孟县小麦的丰产经验，亩产六百至七百斤的小麦，每亩约需人粪尿三十担，草肥八十担和化肥三十斤。这就是说，一亩丰产田需用的肥料，是既要质量好又要数量多的。现在按全国播种面积计算，平均每亩只有肥料八十多担。因此，当前的迫切任务是立即动手大抓肥料生产，为今年农业继续跃进准备更多的肥料。
    今年农村许多地区建立了肥料基地，同时大搞群众运动，广辟肥源。这是肥料生产的两条腿走路的方针。实行这个方针，就可以使肥料生产又多又快又好又省，以便给农业继续跃进提供充分可靠的肥源。建立肥料基地和大搞群众性积肥运动相结合，这是人民公社的创举，是农业大跃进的产物，有着无限的生命力。
    建立肥料基地首先必须发展以养猪为中心的畜牧业。全国各地从去冬以来热烈响应党中央和毛主席的号召，掀起了一个养猪积肥的高潮，猪只头数增长很快，据最近统计，全国各人民公社、生产队和公共食堂已建立二百万个集体养猪场，这些养猪场同时也就是经常地、大量地供应农作物以优质肥料的最可靠的基地。建立肥料基地的其他措施是种植绿肥和广泛建立土化肥厂。现在，许多人民公社都有了以养猪场为中心同时种植绿肥和制造土化肥的肥料生产基地。因此，以养猪积肥为主，实行养、种、造三结合，更好地培植肥源，进一步利用肥源，这是今后解决肥料问题的重要出路。这几方面的肥料资源非常丰富，潜力无穷；不仅可以增加肥料数量，还可以迅速提高肥料质量。
    以养猪积肥为主、建立常年生产的肥料基地的同时，还要广辟肥源，大搞积肥运动，积造更多的自然肥料。目前，建立肥料基地的工作刚刚开始，还不可能一下子就供应很多的肥料。以养猪来说，现在猪的数量还不够多，圈里的粪尿还不能解决农作物所需要的全部肥料，绿肥和化肥的数量也不多。因此，我们一方面要大搞肥料的基本建设，保证有一定数量的精肥，同时也要像往年一样，广泛开辟肥源，积造更多的杂肥。这也就是说，在积肥运动方面，应该实行精肥和粗肥并举、建立肥料基地和广辟肥源并举，经常积肥和突击积肥并举的两条腿走路的方针。事实证明，只有这样，才能满足农业继续跃进对肥料的巨大需要，同时还能够综合利用各种肥料，发挥不同肥料的不同的作用。例如河泥施在沙土地，可起土壤改良的作用；骨灰含磷很高，适宜于缺磷的酸性土壤施用。
    年年要积自然肥料。自然界各种物质天天在分解、腐烂，也可以说，大自然天天在制造各种有机和无机的肥料。例如炕土年年可换，河泥年年可挖，垃圾天天都有。群众常说“流不尽的水，积不完的肥”，就是这个道理。只要充分发动群众，人人动手，户户积肥，就一定能够做到：家肥出门，野肥归田，山肥下山，河肥、海肥上岸。
    积肥、造肥、运肥中的劳力不足怎么办？现在看来，这个问题是不难解决的。全国已有三百一十多万处水利工程已经完工（约占全部工程的三分之二以上），除了那些仍需继续施工和那些水利建设的“死角”仍然需要抓紧消灭以外，目前可以立即抽调出大批劳力转入积肥战线。不少地方已经这样做了。春耕准备工作进入紧张阶段以后，还需要抽调更多的劳力从事于积肥造肥工作。同时，大搞工具改革，也是解决劳力不足的重要办法。许多地方把水利工地的工具改革和技术革新运动，迅速转向积肥、运肥的技术革新，大大提高了工效。湖南汝桂县在积肥运动中大搞工具改革，全县四万八千积肥大军，平均每天每人积肥一百零二担，节省了四百零六万个劳动日。各地应该很好地总结和推广这方面的经验，在积肥、运肥方面也要掀起一个高工效运动。就是没有完工的水利工地，也可以把兴修水利和积肥结合起来。福建南安县东田公社在大搞水利运动中，采取“顺手牵羊”的办法，结合水利工程的清基、除草皮、挖池塘、挖沟泥等办法，积肥一百七十七万多担，出现了水利积肥双跃进的局面。
    现在许多地方群众已经行动起来，积肥、造肥、运肥的高潮正在掀起。有一首民歌十分生动地反映了群众积肥的干劲：“生产更跃进，田肥人更勤。积肥如积粮，一担值千金。”现在的问题在于进一步加强领导，把群众的干劲充分发挥出来，迅速解决各种具体问题，采取具体有效的措施，分秒必争地展开广泛的积肥运动。
    多积肥、积好肥的同时，还应当提倡边积肥边送肥，快积快送。过去有不少地区冬天大量积肥，春天才突击送肥，结果耽误了生产。今年各地应该在积肥的同时，掀起一个送肥高潮，力争把小麦所用的追肥和春耕播种所需要的肥料在立春前后全部送到地里。春播未动，肥料先行，地里有肥，心中有数。这样，人民公社广大社员就可以腾出手来，把今年春耕春播和小麦田间管理做得更细更好。
