Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, when answering questions in the Diet on the 10th, once again explained the "scope of the Far East region" stipulated in the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," saying that this scope includes China's Kinmen and Matsu Islands.

Kishi Nobusuke also said that although the Far East region does not include northern Korea, it is "unclear" whether the 38th parallel can be used as a boundary. Kishi Nobusuke changed his statement made on the 8th in the House of Representatives Budget Committee that the Far East region included the northern part of the Kuril Islands of the Soviet Union, to exclude the northern part of the Kuril Islands.

Kyodo News Agency said that the Kishi Nobusuke government is very afraid that the interpretation that the Far East region "includes the Kuril Islands" will become an obstacle to future Diet deliberations on the new "Security Treaty."

Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama once clearly admitted that the Far East region stipulated in the new "Security Treaty" includes mainland China and the Soviet Maritime Region.

According to a Washington report from United Press International on the 9th, U.S. officials use the word "Far East" to mean "the entire East Asian region, from the Siberian coast south through Japan, Korea, China, the Philippines, Indonesia, and the mainland countries of Southeast Asia, but not including India and Pakistan." In order to cover up the truth that the new "Security Treaty" is a war treaty, Kishi Nobusuke has made contradictory explanations of the "scope of the Far East region" in his Diet replies these past two days. When answering a question from Socialist Party member Hisao Kuroda on the 8th, he said that he believed that the scope of the Far East "refers to the area from the north of the Philippines to the area around Japan, excluding the Soviet Maritime Region." At the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 9th, Kishi Nobusuke, under the questioning of Japanese Socialist Party member Setsuo Yokoro, finally answered in a flustered manner, "The Far East region stipulated in the Security Treaty refers to the Philippine region and the region around Japan" "excluding the (Soviet) Maritime Region and mainland China." But then he said that the "Habomai Islands, Shikotan Island, Kunashiri Island, and Etorofu Island," which are under Soviet jurisdiction, "belong to the waters adjacent to Japan, so of course they are included in the scope of the Far East."

Obviously, his various lies cannot conceal the aggressive military alliance nature of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" which is directed against China, the Soviet Union and other countries.

### 岸信介侵略凶相毕露  公然说日美条约适用范围包括我国金门马祖

    岸信介侵略凶相毕露
    公然说日美条约适用范围包括我国金门马祖
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：日本首相岸信介10日在国会答辩时再次就新日美“安全条约”所规定的“远东地区范围”解释说，这个范围包括到中国的金门和马祖岛。
    岸信介还说，远东地区虽然不包括朝鲜北部，但是能否以三十八度线为界，还“不明确”。岸信介把他8日在众议院预算委员会上所说的远东地区包括苏联的千岛北部的说法，改为不包括千岛北部。
    共同社说，岸信介政府非常骇怕远东地区“包括千岛群岛在内”的解释会成为今后国会审议新“安全条约”时的障碍。
    日本外相藤山爱一郎曾经明确承认：新“安全条约”中规定的远东地区包括中国大陆和苏联滨海地区。
    据合众国际社华盛顿9日消息说，美国官员用“远东”这个字眼的意思指“整个东亚地区，从西伯利亚海岸向南经过日本、朝鲜、中国、菲律宾、印度尼西亚和东南亚的大陆国家，但不包括印度和巴基斯坦”。岸信介为了掩盖新“安全条约”是一个战争条约的真相，这两天在国会答辩中对“远东地区范围”作了矛盾百出的解释。他8日在回答社会党议员黑田寿男的质询时说，他认为关于远东的范围
  “是指从菲律宾以北到日本周围为止的地区，不包括苏联滨海地区”。在9日的众议院预算委员会上，岸信介在日本社会党议员横路节雄的追问下，最后狼狈地回答，“安全条约所规定的远东地区是指菲律宾地区和日本周围的地区”“不包括（苏联）滨海和中国大陆”。但是他又说，苏联管辖下的“齿舞岛、色丹岛和国后岛、择捉岛，是属于毗邻日本的海域，所以当然包括在远东的范围以内”。
    显然，他的种种谎言无法掩盖新日美“安全条约”是针对中苏等国的侵略性的军事同盟的实质。
