    Qian Chun - Native Expert in Port Mechanization
    (Our report) Qian Chun, the leader of the tool group in the Tianjin New Port operation area and a native expert in port mechanization, has recently successfully trial-produced a "spiral machine," which has mechanized the short-distance loading and transportation of ore and sand, reducing labor by more than 70%. This creation is one of the fifteen major innovation proposals Qian Chun put forward after returning from the National Congress of Heroes last year.
    Qian Chun, who was illiterate at the beginning of liberation but now has a junior high school education, has been elected as a labor model or advanced producer every year since 1953. He has created and improved more than 130 port loading and unloading tools and machines. In 1959, twenty-three of his innovation proposals were adopted, enabling the complete mechanization of loading and unloading of bulk materials such as coal and salt in the port. The combined coal loading machine he created not only eliminated the heavy manual labor of carrying coal from unloading to feeding and leveling, but also saved two hundred workers per shift. Now, when you come to the New Port wharf, you can no longer see the phenomenon of manual coal carrying.
    Qian Chun engages in technological innovation with the revolutionary heroic spirit of the working class. In order to realize machine leveling, he overcame numerous difficulties and repeatedly experimented forty-two times before achieving success. In the past, forty workers were needed to go to the hold, braving coal smoke and high temperatures to level the hold with shovels, but now only three workers are needed to operate the machine on the ship.
    Back in 1954, when Qian Chun saw the workers' laborious efforts to load large quantities of bulk salt into the ship every day, he thought: if there was an "automatic salt winnowing basket," it would be much easier. Since then, he has experimented again and again, year after year. Failure, then experiment; another failure, another experiment. With the support of the Party, after five years of hard work, he finally succeeded in the experiment. He often said to people: "There must always be a question mark in your mind. Experience will not come to you, you have to go to it."

    钱春——港口机械化土专家
    本报讯　港口机械化的土专家——天津新港作业区工具组组长钱春，最近又试制成功“螺旋机”，使短途装运矿石、砂子的工序实现了机械化，减少了70％以上的劳动力。这项创造是钱春去年出席全国群英大会回来后，提出的十五项重大革新建议中的一项。
    解放初期还是一字不识，而现在已有初中文化程度的钱春，从1953年以来，年年当选劳动模范或先进生产者，共创造和改进了一百三十多项港口装卸工具和机械。1959年，他提出的革新建议，有二十三项被采纳，使港口装卸煤、盐等大宗散运物资全部实现了机械化。他创造的联合装煤机，不仅使卸车、供料到平仓的装煤作业彻底消灭了人抬的笨重体力劳动，而且每班还节约了二百名工人。现在来到新港码头，已经再也看不到人工抬煤的现象了。
    钱春是以工人阶级的革命英雄气概从事技术革新的。为了实现机器平仓，他曾经克服重重困难，反复试验四十二次才获得成功。过去需要四十名工人冒着煤烟和高温到船仓用铁锹平仓，而现在只要三个工人在船上操纵机器就行了。
    还是1954年的时候，钱春看到工人每天把大批散盐往船里装时的那种费劲的样子，就想：要是搞个“自动盐簸箕”，那就省事多了。从此，他一次又一次、一年又一年地试验。失败，又试验；再失败，再试验。在党的支持下，经过五年刻苦钻研，终于试验成功。他经常对人说：“脑子里总得有个问号，经验不会来找人，要人去找它才行。”
