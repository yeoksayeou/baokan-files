The Main Experiences of Soil and Water Conservation in the Linyi Area
Zhu Qimin, First Secretary of the Linyi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

More than two-thirds of the total area of Linyi Prefecture, Shandong Province, is mountainous and hilly. Before liberation, due to the exploitation by the rulers and the ravages of war, the water system was disordered, the river channels were silted up, waterlogging and drought intertwined year after year, and soil erosion was extremely serious, resulting in barren land, impoverished people, and very low grain yields (below the provincial average). The masses called this natural environment "poor mountains and bad waters."

After liberation, the Party led the masses in soil and water conservation and did a lot of work. Especially since 1958, the people of the entire region, guided by the general line and relying on the enormous superiority of the people's communes, have achieved great achievements in water conservancy construction. In the past two years, the region has treated more than 3.5 million mu of barren mountains, managed 7,994 mountain tops, and, together with the past, renovated 5.29 million mu of terraced fields and sloping land; built 4,221 large, medium, and small reservoirs, completed 208 large diversion river projects, drilled more than 13,000 machine wells, and transformed more than 3 million mu of waterlogged and low-lying land. These water conservancy projects can control an irrigation area of nearly 10 million mu, accounting for 64% of the cultivated land area; can control a soil erosion area of more than 9,530 square kilometers, and store 1.9 billion cubic meters of water (accounting for 32% of the general annual water loss in the region).

Soil and water conservation have brought a new look to the mountains and rivers. The runoff of various rivers, large and small, has been greatly reduced, and the riverbeds have been deepened and the river surfaces narrowed. The treated barren mountains have been tested by rainfall of 150 to 200 mm, and can basically control soil erosion; while in the dry season, they have increased the water level of the river channels. In 1959, a severe drought was encountered, and most counties did not have a thorough rain throughout the year, but the grain output of the entire region still increased by more than 10% compared with 1958.

The experiences of carrying out the soil and water conservation movement in the past two years can be summarized as follows:

Persist in Implementing the Party's Policies

For a long time, we had the idea of drainage in soil and water conservation work. In the past two years, we have carried out soil and water conservation work based on the "three main" principles of "focusing on storage, focusing on small-scale projects, and focusing on community management," and have achieved great results.

In terms of soil conservation, we have carried out management based on the principles of "fish-scale, bamboo-joint, horizontal ditch, reservoir dams, terraced fields, and gravity-flow canals" as instructed by the Provincial Party Committee and Comrade Shu Tong. However, in the specific implementation, the layout of each project is increased or decreased according to different terrains and conditions. For example, the slope management projects on sandy and stony mountains include: fish-scale pits, bamboo-joint ditches, horizontal ditches, etc.; the ditch management projects include: ditch head protection, check dams, ponds, and reservoirs; for stone fortress mountains that cannot be built with fish-scale pits and other projects, intercepting ditches, sand retaining walls, and mountain-encircling interconnected water storage pools are built under the fortress to intercept and store floodwater. On the basis of doing a good job in soil conservation projects, we will vigorously develop "three groups" (i.e., groups of water pools, ponds, and reservoirs) and "five connections" (i.e., connecting reservoirs and ditches, reservoirs and rivers, reservoirs and pools, reservoirs and springs, and reservoirs and reservoirs), so that water storage and sand retention projects are scattered like stars, and are linked to form a water conservancy system for storage, irrigation, and drainage, while combining afforestation and greening of barren mountains.

In terms of managing ridges, during the mutual aid group period, we mainly engaged in "two-in-one" (i.e., deep plowing and cultivating field ridges combined); during the cooperativization period, we vigorously engaged in "three-in-one" (i.e., deep plowing, leveling, cultivating field ridges, and building water scoops combined). However, after the people's communes were established, various places adopted thorough revolutionary methods and reached high standards in one step. That is, for a ridge slope, a unified plan is made according to the terrain, and divided into square plots, so that deep plowing, leveling, merging small fields into large fields, building irrigation canals, cultivating field ridges, planting trees, and building roads are achieved in "four-in-one," "five-in-one," or "six-in-one" in one go. In the winter of 1959, more than 1.6 million mu of the region's 2.6 million mu of ridge management projects reached high standards.

The management of mountains and ridges must be unified planned and comprehensively managed, from top to bottom, combining slopes and ditches, so as to manage one place of mountains, slopes, ridges, and ditches, complete one place, consolidate one place, and use one place.

In terms of plain water conservancy and transformation of waterlogged areas, we resolutely implemented Comrade Shu Tong's instruction of "three sluices, three connections, three under-springs, plus wells, reservoirs, and large ridge fields" (the so-called "three connections" refer to connecting ditches and ditches, rivers and ditches, and ditches and ponds; "three sluices" refer to sluicing rivers, ditches, and bridges; "three under-springs" refer to springs under wells, ponds, and ditches). Because most of the plains in our region are piedmont plains and small mountain basin plains, with large slopes and many rivers, and the Yi and Shu Rivers run through the north and south. Taking this approach can block the river water, divert it for irrigation, and store the excess water for use at any time. In the past two years, more than 1,000 large and small rivers have been gated, and some small rivers have now been stepped up due to the construction of gates. With sluice dam projects on the rivers, the diverted water can be vigorously used for "three connections" to adjust water use. If the water volume is insufficient, the "three under-springs" method is adopted to use groundwater to supplement surface water. At the same time, some machine wells and brick and stone wells were drilled in places where gravity irrigation cannot reach or is insufficient, to achieve "double insurance."

With the construction of these projects, we have built more than 5 million mu of ridge fields in the past two years, and combined with canal projects to build more than 1 million mu of large garden fields and platform fields, so that a water conservancy system that can store, irrigate, and drain has been initially formed in the plains.

Vigorously Launch Mass Movements

The soil and water conservation movement is actually a large-scale mass movement. We must adhere to putting politics in command, boldly mobilizing the masses, and overcoming all negative and fearful emotions. Practice in the past two years has proved that: wherever the leadership has a strong determination, great courage, resolutely mobilizes the masses, organizes large-scale battles, with thousands of troops and horses and a mighty momentum, carries out surprise attacks with overwhelming advantages, the results are remarkable, and the project is completed quickly; conversely, if there is a lack of such ambition and courage, organizing a few people, facing a large mountain, doing piecemeal work, the movement will be cold and clear, and the results will not be great. After the masses are mobilized, it is also necessary to continuously strengthen political and ideological work to maintain the masses' high political enthusiasm and long-lasting drive. In the construction, we also adopted the method of summarizing, comparing, praising, and rewarding model units and model figures, inserting red flags, and setting up pacesetters after each section was completed. As a result, the masses became more and more enthusiastic, and their drive became greater and greater, not only engaging in water conservancy construction but also training people.

As long as we firmly believe in and rely on the masses, the problems of funds, materials, and technology in water conservancy construction will be solved easily. When the large-scale soil and water conservation movement began in the spring of 1958, it was just after the region suffered severe floods and droughts in 1957. At that time, not only were the masses' lives difficult, but also funds and materials were extremely scarce. What attitude to take in the face of difficulties is a touchstone for testing every Communist Party member. The vast majority of comrades in the region firmly believed in the masses, seized the masses' urgent demand—to get rid of the threat of water and drought disasters, and relied on the masses to solve all difficulties. On the one hand, they actively led the masses to develop sideline businesses, increase income, and solve the difficulties in life; on the other hand, they submitted the soil and water conservation plan to the broad masses for discussion and actively mobilized the masses. After the masses were mobilized, for the sake of long-term interests, they were willing to endure temporary difficulties in life, bringing their own food and tools to work on the mountains, and fully developed the glorious tradition of hard work and self-reliance of the mountain people. The slogan put forward by the masses was: "Do it with money, do it without money." If there were not enough materials, the masses would take out wood and stones, and donate scrap iron and steel; if there were not enough funds, they would invest in the community. According to preliminary statistics, in 1958 alone, the masses in the region invested more than 63 million cubic meters of bricks and stones, more than 32 million cubic meters of wood, and other tools, materials, etc., with a total value of more than 153.34 million yuan. These facts once again illustrate that: relying on the masses to carry out water conservancy construction is the fundamental method to implement the Party's general line; it is an important method to adapt to the needs of large-scale soil and water conservation in a faster, better, and more economical way. Of course, when holding large-scale water conservancy projects, it is still very important for the state to give necessary subsidies in terms of funds and materials, and to give guidance in terms of technology.

We have a principle on the attitude towards technical issues, that is, we must not disbelieve, and we must not be superstitious. That is, the reasonable opinions of technical personnel should be accepted and resolutely implemented; those old rules and regulations of theirs should not be accepted. In this regard, we resolutely implemented the method of combining leadership and technology, technology and politics, and technology and the masses, and resolutely advocated vigorously launching mass movements and relying on the masses to solve technical problems. On the one hand, we organized a large number of cadres to go deep down to summarize the experience of the masses in soil and water conservation over the years; on the other hand, we sent cadres and the masses to other places to learn from experience. In order to cultivate a large number of technical forces, each county concentrated a group of soil conservation teams to concentrate on one mountain top, lecturing, discussing, and conducting on-site experiments. In this way, using the project as teaching material, the construction site as a classroom, and the site as an examination room, we constantly watched, learned, and did, and constantly summarized experiences and lessons, and created a complete set of soil conservation engineering experience.

Strengthen Party Leadership

The achievements made in soil and water conservation in our region in the past two years are the result of implementing the Central Committee's policies and the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee. Many cadres and the masses said: "Thousands of things, the Party's leadership is the first." In the past two years, the Provincial Party Committee, especially Comrade Shu Tong, has given us specific instructions on many important junctures in the soil and water conservation movement. In the spring of 1959, when the construction of the six major reservoirs entered a critical juncture, some comrades believed that materials, funds, and labor were very tight and advocated dismounting. We analyzed the situation and conditions of the entire region and believed that as long as we relied on the communes and the masses, we were fully qualified and capable of building the six major reservoirs. When we asked Comrade Shu Tong for instructions, he instructed us to do it as long as there were conditions and possibilities. As a result, the six major reservoirs were successfully completed. We deeply realized that the Central Committee's policies and the Provincial Party Committee's instructions must be resolutely implemented.

Overall planning and rational allocation of labor are an important issue in resolving the contradiction between soil and water conservation and agricultural production. In terms of labor organization and combat deployment, we adopted the method of establishing professional teams, according to the method of doing less when busy, doing more when less busy, and surprise attacks during slack seasons, so that soil and water conservation activities persisted throughout the year, so as to achieve a comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production and soil and water conservation. The second is to promote the style of cooperation. In the construction of some large-scale water conservancy projects and large-scale soil and ridge management and mountain closure afforestation, the method of one community supporting several communities when there are difficulties, under unified leadership, and according to the principle of equivalent exchange, is adopted. In 1958, soil and water conservation persisted throughout the year, and agricultural production achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest and great leap forward; in 1959, the six major reservoirs were built to "lock the dragon," and agricultural production continued to achieve a great leap forward.

"One red flower is not spring, but a hundred flowers in full bloom is spring." Grasp typical examples, set up banners, summarize experiences, and promote them comprehensively from point to area. We paid attention to this issue at the beginning of soil and water conservation. In mountainous areas, we summarized and promoted the experience of soil and water conservation in Xiawei Commune, Yishui County, and the experience of Shiquan Lake, Junan County; in hilly areas, we summarized and promoted the experience of Dashan Commune; in plain areas, we promoted the experience of water conservancy in Matou Commune, Tancheng County. The promotion of these experiences greatly promoted the rapid development of water conservancy construction in various types of areas.

In the mass movement of soil and water conservation, it is necessary to strengthen organizational leadership. In this regard, we adopted the method of comprehensive planning, strengthening leadership, the secretary taking the lead, and division of labor and contracting. In 1958, the Prefectural Committee was responsible for the six major river basins, with division of labor and responsibility to the end; in 1959, it was based on the six major reservoir projects, under the unified leadership of the Prefectural Committee, the secretary and standing committee members in charge of agriculture focused on mastering and strengthening guidance. The county committees also made management plans, established command posts, and the secretary took the lead, the committee members divided the work, each contracted a piece, and contracted to the end, according to the river basin situation and project requirements of their respective counties. Leading cadres at all levels worked with the migrant workers on the construction site, grasping the project with one hand and grasping life with the other, thus greatly promoting the progress of the project.

After two years of hard work, although great achievements have been made in soil and water conservation, our work is still developing unevenly, and there is still a long way to go from the high standards of soil and water conservation. The task before us in the future is to move towards the high standards of water conservancy and soil and water conservation.

    临沂地区治山治水的主要经验
    中共临沂地委第一书记　朱奇民
    山东临沂专区的山区和丘陵占全区总面积的三分之二以上。解放前，由于统治者的盘剥和战争摧残，水系紊乱，河道淤塞，连年水旱交织，水土流失极为严重，以致地瘠民贫，粮食产量很低（在全省平均数以下）。群众称这种自然环境为“穷山恶水”。
    解放后，党领导群众治山治水，作了许多工作。特别是从1958年起，全区人民根据总路线所指引的方向，凭借着人民公社的巨大优越性，水利建设取得了巨大成就。两年来，全区共治理荒山三百五十多万亩，治理山头七千九百九十四个，连同过去的共整修梯田、坡地五百二十九万亩；兴建大、中、小型水库四千二百二十一座，修成较大引河工程二百零八处，打机井一万三千多眼，改造涝洼地三百多万亩。这些水利工程可以控制灌溉面积近千万亩，占耕地面积的64％；可以控制水土流失面积九千五百三十多平方公里，蓄水十九亿方（占全区一般年景流失水量的32％）。
    治山治水使得山河面貌一新。各大小河流的径流量大大减少，并且刷深了河槽，缩窄了河面。治理过的荒山经过一次降雨一百五十至二百毫米的考验，均可以基本上控制水土流失；而在枯水季节，却又提高了河道水位。1959年遇到严重的旱灾，大部分县全年未下透雨，但是全区粮食仍然比1958年增产一成多。
    两年来开展治山治水运动的经验，概括起来有以下几点：
    坚持执行党的方针
    治山治水的工作，在较长时间内我们存在着排水的思想。近两年来，我们根据“以蓄为主，小型为主，社办为主”的“三主”方针，展开了治山治水工作，取得巨大的成绩。
    在治山方面，我们是根据省委和舒同同志指示的“鱼鳞竹节水平沟，库坝梯田自流渠”的方针进行治理的。但在具体执行时，各项工程的布局又根据不同地形、条件而有所增减。例如在沙石山的治坡工程有：鱼鳞坑、竹节沟、水平沟等；治沟工程有：沟头防护、谷坊、塘坝水库；对不能修鱼鳞坑等工程的石崮山峰，就在崮下修筑截水沟、拦沙墙、围山连环蓄水池等来拦蓄洪水。在搞好治山工程的基础上，再大搞“三群”（即水池、塘坝、水库群）、“五通”（即库沟、库河、库池、库泉、库库相通），使蓄水拦沙工程星罗棋布，联结成一个蓄、灌、排的水利系统，同时结合植树造林，绿化荒山。
    在治岭方面，在互助组时期，主要搞“二合一”（即深翻、培地埂合一）；合作化时期则大搞“三合一”（即深翻整平、培地埂、修水簸箕合一）。但在人民公社化以后，各地采取彻底革命的办法，一步达到高标准化。即对一个岭坡，根据地形，统一规划，按片划方，使深翻整平、小地并大地、修灌溉渠道、培地埂、植树、修路等工作，实现“四合一”、“五合一”或“六合一”，一气呵成。1959年冬季全区二百六十余万亩治岭工程中，达到高标准的即有一百六十多万亩。
    治山治岭必须统一规划，综合治理，由上而下，坡沟兼治，作到对山、坡、岭、沟治一处，成一处，巩固一处，用一处。
    在平原水利化和改造涝洼方面，我们坚决贯彻了舒同同志指示的“三闸三通三下泉，再加井库大畦田”的方针（所谓“三通”即沟沟、河沟、沟汪相通；“三闸”即闸河、沟、桥；“三下泉”即井、汪、沟下泉）。由于我区的平原多是山麓平原和山区盆地小平原，坡降较大，河流较多，且有沂沭河纵贯南北。采取这样的方针便可把河水拦起来，引出灌溉，并把多余的水蓄存起来，随时运用。两年来共闸大小河一千余道，如今有些小河，由于节节设闸已作到了河道阶梯化。河流上有了闸坝工程，引出的水就可以大搞“三通”，以便调剂用水。如果水量不足，则采取“三下泉”办法，利用地下水补充地上水。同时对自流灌溉达不到或不充分的地方，又打了些机井和砖石井，作到了“双保险”。
    随着这些工程的兴修，两年来我们共修畦田五百余万亩，并结合渠道工程搞了一百多万亩的大地园田、台田，这样在平原便初步形成了一个能蓄、灌、排的水利系统。
    大搞群众运动
    治山治水运动，实际上是大规模的群众运动。必须坚持政治挂帅，大胆放手发动群众，克服一切消极畏难情绪。两年来的实践证明：凡是领导决心强、魄力大，坚决发动群众，组织大兵团作战，千军万马、声势浩大，以压倒的优势进行突击，成效就卓著，工程完成就迅速；反之，缺乏这种雄心和气魄，组织少数人，面对一座大山，零打碎敲，运动就冷冷清清，成效不大。群众发动起来后，还要不断的加强政治思想工作，以保持群众的政治情绪高涨和干劲经久不衰。在施工中，还采取每干一段即进行总结评比，表扬奖励模范单位和模范人物，插红旗、树标兵的方法。这样作的结果，群众越干情绪越高，干劲越大，不仅搞了水利建设而且还锻炼了人。
    只要坚决相信群众、依靠群众，水利建设中的资金、物料和技术问题，便会迎刃而解。1958年春大搞治山治水运动开始时，正是1957年全区遭受大水灾和大旱灾之后。当时不但群众生活困难，资金物料也极为缺乏。在困难面前抱什么态度，是对每个共产党员考验的试金石。全区绝大多数的同志坚定地相信群众，抓住群众的迫切要求——摆脱水旱灾害威胁，依靠群众来解决一切困难。一方面积极领导群众开展副业，增加收入，解决生活困难；另方面把治山治水的规划提交广大群众讨论，积极发动群众。群众发动起来后，为了长远的利益，宁愿忍受生活上暂时的困难，自带粮食、工具上山劳动，充分发扬了山区人民艰苦奋斗、自力更生的光荣传统。群众提出的口号是：“有钱也干，无钱也干。”物料不足群众就拿出木料、砖石，献出废钢铁；资金不足就向社里投资。据初步统计，仅在1958年全区群众即投出砖石六千三百多万方，木料三千二百多万立方，以及其他工具、财物等，总值共达一亿五千三百三十四万余元。这些事实再一次说明：依靠群众举办水利建设，是贯彻执行党的总路线的根本方法；是适应大规模治山治水需要的多快好省的重要方法。当然在举办大型水利工程的时候，国家在资金与物料方面予以必要的补助，在技术方面给予指导还是十分重要的。
    我们对技术问题的态度有一条原则，即是不可不信，不可迷信。即对技术人员的合理意见就接受下来，坚决去办；对他们那些陈规旧律就不予接受。在这方面我们坚决的贯彻了领导与技术、技术与政治、技术与群众相结合的办法，并坚决主张大搞群众运动，依靠群众来解决技术问题。我们一方面组织大批干部深入下去，总结群众多年来治山治水的经验；另方面派出干部和群众到外地取经。为了培养大批的技术力量，每县都集中了一批治山队伍集中到一个山头，边讲、边讨论、边实地试验。这样以工程当教材，以工地当课堂，以现场为考场，边看、边学、边做，不断总结经验教训，创造出一套完整的治山工程经验。
    加强党的领导
    我区两年来治山治水所取得的成绩，是执行中央的方针和省委指示的结果。不少干部和群众说：“千条万条党的领导是第一条。”两年来在治山治水运动中，许多重要关头上，省委特别是舒同同志都给了我们以具体指示。1959年春季，当六大水库施工进入紧要关头时，有的同志认为物料、资金、劳力很紧张，主张下马。我们分析了全区的情况和条件，认为只要依靠公社和群众，完全有条件有可能建成六大水库。当我们请示舒同同志的时候，他指示我们只要有条件有可能就干。结果六大水库就胜利的完成了。我们深深体会到，对中央的方针和省委的指示必须坚决贯彻执行。
    全面规划合理安排劳力，是解决治山治水和农业生产矛盾的一个重要问题。在劳力组织和战斗部署上，我们采取了建立专业队伍，根据大忙小干、小忙大干、农闲突击的方法，使治山治水的活动坚持全年，作到农业生产和治山治水全面跃进。其次是大兴协作之风。在修建一些大型水利工程和大面积的治山治岭、封山造林中，都是采取在统一领导下，按照等价交换的原则，一社有困难，数社去支援的办法进行的。1958年治山治水坚持了全年，而农业生产获得了史无前例的大丰收、大跃进；1959年建成六大水库“锁蛟龙”，农业生产仍然是继续取得了大跃进。
    “一朵红花不是春，万紫千红才是春”。抓典型树旗帜，总结经验，以点带面，全面推广。在治山治水开始时，我们即注意了这个问题。在山区，我们总结推广了沂水县夏蔚公社治山治水的经验和莒南县石泉湖的经验；在丘陵区，总结推广了大山公社的经验；平原地区推广了郯城县马头公社水利化的经验。推广这些经验，大大促进了各类地区水利建设的迅速发展。
    治山治水的群众运动中，必须加强组织领导。这方面我们采取了全面规划，加强领导，书记挂帅，分工包干的办法。1958年地委是按照六大流域，分工负责，包干到底；1959年则是根据六大水库工程，在地委统一领导下，由分工农业的书记、常委重点掌握，加强指导。各县委也都根据本县流域情况和工程要求，作出治理规划，建立指挥部，由书记挂帅，委员分工，各包一片，一包到底。各级领导干部在工地上与民工一起劳动，一手抓工程，一手抓生活，因此大大推动了工程的进度。
    经过两年的艰苦奋战，在治山治水方面虽然取得了很大成绩，但我们的工作还发展的不平衡，离治山治水高标准还相差很远。今后摆在我们面前的任务，就是向水利化和水土保持高标准化前进。
