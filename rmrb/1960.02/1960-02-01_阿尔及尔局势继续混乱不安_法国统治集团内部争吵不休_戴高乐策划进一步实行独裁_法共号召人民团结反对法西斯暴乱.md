Report compiled by our newspaper: The riots launched by French extreme colonialists in Algiers continue and may spread to other cities in the French-occupied zone of Algeria. The outbreak and continuation of this riot event shows that France's colonial policy in Algeria has reached its end.

    The Algiers Riot Continues
    The Arrogance of Extreme Colonial Elements is Even More Rampant
    The French extreme colonial elements who launched the riots in Algiers are becoming increasingly arrogant. From Western news agency reports, it can be seen that a strange situation has emerged in Algiers. Fully armed rioters continue to occupy their two strongholds, strengthening their fortifications. They freely chat and laugh with some French immigrants who gather near the strongholds to watch the excitement and give inflammatory speeches. The French troops stationed around the strongholds continue to do nothing, only drinking, playing cards, or writing letters in their fortifications. The Algiers municipal authorities are openly raising funds to help the rioters. The rioters have even obtained a radio station as their mouthpiece. Under the coercion of the rioters, the city of Algiers continues to be paralyzed with everything at a standstill.

    In other cities in the French-occupied zone of Algeria, such as Oran, Constantine, and Bône, extreme colonial elements continue to coerce residents to strike and go on strike. In Mostaganem, extreme colonial elements clashed with supporters of De Gaulle on the 27th, resulting in six injuries.

    De Gaulle Tries His Best to Appease the Rioters
    Shouting That He Will Never Give Up Algeria
    The French government has adopted a tolerant attitude towards the rioters. French President Charles de Gaulle delivered a radio address on the 29th, doing his best to appease the French colonialists in Algeria.

    De Gaulle said that he had proposed giving the Algerian people the "right to self-determination." However, he himself revealed what his so-called "self-determination" was all about. He insisted that "self-determination will only be a policy worth adopting by France" when "a ceasefire has been achieved in some way or the 'rebels' (referring to the Algerian National Liberation Army) have been completely crushed."

    De Gaulle also assured the French colonialists in Algeria that he would never give up Algeria.

    Divisions Within the French Ruling Clique Deepen
    De Gaulle Plots to Further Implement Dictatorship
    The French bourgeois parties have revealed increasing confusion and division surrounding the Algiers incident. Part of the main ruling party, the "Union for the New Republic," opposes De Gaulle's policy towards Algeria. The Seine province organization of the Independent Party announced "complete agreement" with the extreme colonial elements. Former Prime Minister Pierre Pflimlin published an article on the 27th attacking De Gaulle.

    It is worth noting that Western news agencies have revealed that in a situation where contradictions within the French ruling clique are sharp and De Gaulle is facing great difficulties, De Gaulle is plotting to declare a "state of emergency" throughout France under the pretext of the severity of the situation, and to invoke Article 16 of the De Gaulle "Constitution" to concentrate all power in his own hands during the "state of emergency," in order to further implement personal dictatorship.

    Democratic Forces Condemn the Rioters
    Preparing to Take Action Against the Fascists
    The French left-wing parties and broad sections of the people demand that the government take strong and effective measures to quell the riots of the extreme colonial elements in Algiers and realize the Algerian people's right to self-determination.

    The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party held a meeting on the 28th, chaired by General Secretary Maurice Thorez, to discuss the current situation in Algeria. The meeting passed a resolution calling on the French people to unite and fight against the fascist rioters in Algeria and for the self-determination of the Algerian people.

    The French National Peace Council, in its statement, demanded that the government realize the right to self-determination for the Algerian people. The Administrative Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor issued a statement calling on the French working class to unite and take action immediately.

    阿尔及尔局势继续混乱不安
    法国统治集团内部争吵不休　戴高乐策划进一步实行独裁
    法共号召人民团结反对法西斯暴乱
    本报综合报道　法国极端殖民主义分子在阿尔及尔发动的暴乱仍在继续着，并且可能蔓延到阿尔及利亚法国占领区的其它城市。这个暴乱事件的爆发和延续，表明了法国在阿尔及利亚的殖民政策已经到了山穷水尽的地步。
    阿尔及尔暴乱仍然在继续
    极端殖民分子气焰更嚣张
    在阿尔及尔发动暴乱的法国极端殖民主义分子气焰越来越嚣张了。从西方通讯社的报道中可以看出，在阿尔及尔出现了奇怪的局面。全副武装的暴乱分子继续盘踞着他们的两个据点，加强他们的工事。他们自由自在地同聚集在据点附近看热闹的一些法国移民谈笑，发表煽动性演说。而在据点周围布防的法国军队却继续无所作为，只在工事里饮酒、打纸牌或写信。阿尔及尔市政当局正在公开募款接济暴乱分子。暴乱分子甚至已经获得一部电台作为他们的喉舌。在暴乱分子的胁迫下，阿尔及尔市继续处于一切停顿的瘫痪状态。
    在阿尔及利亚法占区的奥兰、君士坦丁和波尼等其他一些城市，极端殖民主义分子继续胁迫居民罢市、罢工。在摩斯塔加内姆，极端殖民主义分子同拥护戴高乐分子27日发生冲突，以致六个人受伤。
    戴高乐竭力安抚暴乱分子
    叫嚷决不放弃阿尔及利亚
    法国政府对暴乱分子采取了纵容的态度。法国总统戴高乐29日发表广播演说，就竭力安抚在阿尔及利亚的法国殖民主义者。
    戴高乐说，他曾经提出给予阿尔及利亚人民“自决权”的建议。但是，他自己道破了他所谓的“自决”是件什么货色。他坚持，只有用“某种方式实现了停火或者完全粉碎‘叛乱者’（指阿尔及利亚民族解放军）的时候”，“自决才是法国值得采取的政策”。
    戴高乐还向在阿尔及利亚的法国殖民主义者保证决不放弃阿尔及利亚。
    法国统治集团内分歧加深
    戴高乐策划进一步搞独裁
    法国各资产阶级政党环绕着阿尔及尔事件暴露了越来越大的混乱和分歧。主要执政党“保卫新共和联盟”中有一部分人反对戴高乐对阿尔及利亚的政策。独立党塞纳省组织宣布同极端殖民主义分子“完全一致”。前总理皮杜尔27日发表文章攻击戴高乐。
    值得注意的是：西方通讯社纷纷透露，在法国统治集团内部矛盾尖锐、戴高乐困难很大的状况下，戴高乐正在策划以局势严重为借口在法国全国宣布“紧急状态”，并且援用戴高乐“宪法”第十六条在“紧急状态”期间把一切权力集中在他一人手里，以进一步实施个人独裁。
    民主力量谴责暴乱分子
    准备用行动对付法西斯
    法国各左翼政党和广泛阶层的人民要求政府采取有力和有效措施来平定阿尔及尔极端殖民主义分子的暴乱和实现阿尔及利亚人民自决的权利。
    法国共产党中央委员会政治局28日在总书记多列士主持下举行会议，讨论阿尔及利亚目前局势。会议通过了决定，号召法国人民团结起来，为反对阿尔及利亚法西斯暴乱分子、争取阿尔及利亚人民的自决而斗争。
    法国全国和平理事会在它的声明中要求政府实现给予阿尔及利亚人民自决权。法国总工会行政局发表声明，号召法国工人阶级立刻团结和行动起来。
