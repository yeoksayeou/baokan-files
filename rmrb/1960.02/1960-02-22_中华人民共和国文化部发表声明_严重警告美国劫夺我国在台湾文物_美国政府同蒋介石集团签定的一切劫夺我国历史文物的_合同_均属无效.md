Xinhua News Agency, 21st - The Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China issued a stern warning against the U.S. government's plot to seize a large number of precious Chinese cultural relics in Taiwan and issued a statement. The full text of the statement is as follows:

On February 12, the U.S. State Department issued a statement in Washington saying that the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique had reached a so-called "agreement" to transport a large number of precious cultural relics that the Chiang Kai-shek clique had plundered and taken to Taiwan before liberation to the United States, and that a "contract" had been illegally signed by Ye Gongchao, the so-called "ambassador" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique to the United States, and Cairns, the secretary of the U.S. National Gallery of Art. The "spokesman for the Executive Yuan Information Bureau" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique also made a traitorous statement in Taipei on the same day, confirming this looting act by the United States, and said that this batch of cultural relics would soon be looted and transported to the United States by U.S. warships. In response, the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China issued a serious warning and made the following statement:

For decades before liberation, the U.S. ruling group had been constantly looting and destroying Chinese cultural relics. The looting of artistic sculptures from Dunhuang and Longmen, and the Zhoukoudian Peking Man skull caused serious damage to China's historical and cultural heritage. In addition, there were 102 boxes (2,755 types) of rare books and more than 10,000 pieces of Juyan Han bamboo slips that the Chinese government deposited in the U.S. Library of Congress before the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, which have not yet been returned. This time, the attempt is to steal the essence of Chinese cultural relics, books and historical archives that were looted and transported to Taiwan by the Chiang Kai-shek clique on the eve of the national liberation. It is known that this batch of cultural relics mainly includes: important collections from the Palace Museum, the Nanjing Museum (formerly the preparatory office of the Central Museum before liberation), the Nanjing Library (formerly the Central Library before liberation), and the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (formerly the archaeological team of the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica and the archaeological team of the Institute of History of the Peking Academy before liberation). These cultural relics are paintings, calligraphy, porcelain, bronzes, jade, pottery, and archaeological finds from Anyang, Junxian, Huixian, and other places before the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (including inscribed oracle bones unearthed in Anyang), as well as rare books from the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties and the Siku Quanshu in the Wenyuan Pavilion. These precious cultural heritages are the cultural wealth created by the Chinese people through thousands of years of labor and are the valuable property of China's 650 million people. The Chiang Kai-shek clique has absolutely no right to dispose of this batch of cultural relics, and the U.S. looting of this batch of cultural relics is an open plunder of Chinese cultural relics. As early as 1954, 1955, and 1959, the U.S. government had repeatedly come forward through U.S. museums, attempting to loot this batch of cultural relics to the United States in the form of "long-term loans," which aroused the indignation of the people of the whole country and repeatedly issued serious warnings and solemn statements. This time, the U.S. State Department openly came forward to carry out the looting. The Chinese people are deeply indignant at this criminal act of U.S. imperialism colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek clique to loot Chinese cultural relics. To this end, the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China now seriously warns the U.S. government: immediately stop this looting; and at the same time warns the Chiang Kai-shek clique: it is not allowed to sell ancestral cultural relics, and any act of transporting ancestral cultural relics to the United States in any form must be stopped. All historical relics currently stored in Taiwan must be properly protected in preparation for their future return to the motherland; and it is declared that all "contracts" signed by the U.S. government with the Chiang Kai-shek clique to plunder Chinese historical relics are invalid. The people of the whole country, including our compatriots in Taiwan, firmly oppose this shameless looting plot of the U.S. government.

Xinhua News Agency, 21st - The U.S. plot to loot ancient and precious cultural relics in Taiwan has recently made further progress.

The U.S. State Department issued a statement in Washington on February 12, claiming that the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique had reached a so-called "agreement" to transport a large number of precious cultural relics from the Palace Museum in Beijing and the Nanjing Museum (the preparatory office of the Central Museum of the Kuomintang government before liberation) in Taiwan to the United States. The U.S. State Department's statement indicated that the so-called "contract" for the "exhibition" of these antiquities from Taiwan to the United States had been illegally initialed on February 12 by Ye Gongchao, the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "ambassador" to the United States, and Cairns, the secretary of the U.S. National Gallery of Art.

The statement said, "A comprehensive exhibition of Chinese ancient art will be held in the United States between 1961 and 1962, including selected treasures from the Chinese National Palace Museum and the Central Museum. The exhibits will be transported to the United States by the Republic of China government (referring to the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique)" and will be "exhibited" successively in Washington, New York, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, and other places starting from June 1, 1961. The statement also said, "The exhibition will include about 100 famous paintings, calligraphy, pottery, porcelain, silverware, jade, etc., made from prehistoric times to the nineteenth century. This will be the largest exhibition of Chinese ancient art ever held in the United States."

On the same day that the U.S. State Department issued this statement, the "spokesman for the Executive Yuan Information Bureau" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique also made a traitorous statement in Taipei, confirming that the United States was about to collude with the Chiang Kai-shek clique to steal a large number of precious Chinese cultural relics in Taiwan to the United States, and that the U.S. Navy warships would be responsible for the looting. The Chiang gang spokesman said that in the past few years, the Chiang Kai-shek clique had "repeatedly received proposals from U.S. public and private sectors to select ancient art from the Chinese Palace Museum for exhibition in the United States." Last autumn, the Chiang Kai-shek clique appointed Ye Gongchao and Wang Shijie to contact the U.S. government in Washington and illegally carry out this traitorous act. According to the Chiang gang spokesman's statement, part of the Anyang bronzes, stone tools, and other precious antiquities in Taiwan from the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (formerly the archaeological team of the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica and the archaeological team of the Institute of History of the Peking Academy before liberation) will also be stolen and transported to the United States this time.

The Chiang Kai-shek clique transported more than 5,000 boxes of precious cultural relics from the Palace Museum in Beijing, the Nanjing Museum, the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Nanjing Library to Taiwan before liberation. For more than ten years, U.S. imperialism has been coveting this batch of precious treasures belonging to the Chinese people. In 1955, Horace Jayne, the deputy director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, came forward and "suggested" that the Chiang Kai-shek clique allow the United States to transport important Chinese cultural relics and books in Taiwan in the form of "long-term loans," and shamelessly said that the U.S. looting of these Chinese treasures "is an unavoidable international obligation." After the news came out, it aroused widespread indignation and protest from the Chinese people, and the U.S. aggressors temporarily withdrew their greedy black hands. Now, U.S. imperialism is preparing to send warships to transport a large number of precious Chinese cultural relics from Taiwan under the pretext of "exhibition," which is obviously implementing its long-planned looting plan. However, this batch of precious Chinese cultural relics in Taiwan is the property of the Chinese people, and the U.S. collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique to attempt to loot them is completely illegal. This blatant and despicable conspiracy can only deepen the Chinese people's indignation and hatred towards U.S. imperialism. No matter where this batch of precious cultural relics is looted to, the Chinese people will definitely recover them all.

    中华人民共和国文化部发表声明
    严重警告美国劫夺我国在台湾文物
    美国政府同蒋介石集团签定的一切劫夺我国历史文物的“合同”均属无效
    新华社21日讯　中华人民共和国文化部对美国政府阴谋劫夺我国在台湾的大批珍贵文物提出严重警告，并且发表声明，声明全文如下：
    2月12日美国国务院在华盛顿发表声明说，美国同蒋介石集团已经达成所谓“协议”，准备把蒋介石集团在解放前劫往台湾的大批珍贵文物运往美国，并且已经由蒋介石集团的所谓驻美“大使”叶公超同美国国立美术馆秘书凯恩斯非法签订了“合同”；蒋介石集团的
  “行政院新闻局发言人”也于同一天在台北发表卖国谈话，证实了美国这一盗劫勾当，并且说这批文物即将由美国军舰劫运去美。对此，中华人民共和国文化部特提出严重警告，并且发表声明如下：
    解放前数十年中，美国统治集团一直不断地劫夺和破坏我国的文物，如敦煌、龙门等地的艺术雕刻和周口店猿人头骨的被劫夺，使我国历史文化遗产遭到严重损失，此外，还有抗日战争前中国政府存在美国国会图书馆的善本书籍一百零二箱（二千七百五十五种）和居延汉简一万余片，至今尚未归还。这一次企图盗劫的是我国在全国解放前夕被蒋介石集团盗运到台湾的文物、图书和历史档案等精华部分。据知这批文物主要包括：故宫博物院、南京博物院（即解放前中央博物院筹备处）、南京图书馆（即解放前中央图书馆）和中国科学院考古所（即解放前的中央研究院历史语言研究所考古组和北平研究院历史研究所考古组）等机构的重要收藏。这些文物都是我国历代相传的绘画、墨迹、瓷器、铜器、玉器、陶器以及抗日战争前安阳、浚县、辉县等地的考古发掘品（包括安阳出土的刻辞甲骨），还有宋、元、明善本书籍和文渊阁四库全书等。这些珍贵的文化遗产，都是我国人民数千年来劳动创造的文化财富，是我国六亿五千万人民的宝贵财产，蒋介石集团绝对无权处理这批文物，美国劫运这批文物，更是对我国文物的公开掠夺。早在1954年、1955年、1959年，美国政府已经几次由美国博物馆出面，图谋以“长期出借”的方式，将这批文物劫运美国，当时激起我全国人民的愤慨，并且一再提出严重警告和严正声明，这一次竟由美国国务院公开出面，进行盗劫。中国人民对美国帝国主义这种勾结蒋介石集团，盗劫我国文物的罪恶行为，表示十分愤慨。为此，中华人民共和国文化部现在严重警告美国政府：立即停止这一盗劫行为，同时警告蒋介石集团：不许盗卖祖国文物，不论用何种形式将祖国文物运送美国的行为必须停止，对于现在存放台湾的一切历史文物，必须妥善保护，准备将来归还祖国；并且声明：美国政府同蒋介石集团签定的一切劫夺我国历史文物的“合同”均属无效。我全国人民，包括我台湾同胞在内，坚决反对美国政府这种无耻掠夺的阴谋。
    新华社21日讯　美国劫夺我国在台湾的古代珍贵文物的阴谋，最近有了进一步的发展。
    美国国务院2月12日在华盛顿发表声明，竟说美国和蒋介石集团已经达成所谓“协议”，准备把我国北京故宫博物院、南京博物院（解放前国民党政府的中央博物院筹备处）在台湾的大批珍贵文物运往美国。美国国务院的声明表明，有关这批古物由台湾运往美国“展览”的所谓“合同”，已经在2月12日由蒋介石集团驻美“大使”叶公超和美国国立美术馆秘书凯恩斯非法草签。
    声明中说，“中国古艺术品将于1961年至1962年间，在美国举行一次包罗甚广的展览，包括从中国国立故宫博物院和中央博物院精选的珍品。这项展览品将由中华民国政府（指台湾蒋介石集团）运送来美”，从1961年6月1日起陆续在华盛顿、纽约、波士顿、芝加哥、旧金山等地“展览”。声明中又说，“这项展览将包括名画珍本约一百幅，名家书法，陶器，瓷器，银器，玉器等，制作时间从史前时期到十九世纪不等。这将是中国古艺术品在美国展览规模最大的一次。”
    与美国国务院发表这个声明的同一天，蒋介石集团“行政院新闻局发言人”也在台北发表卖国谈话，证实美国即将勾结蒋介石集团把我国在台湾的大批珍贵文物盗运往美国，并且由美国海军舰船负责劫运。蒋帮发言人说，过去几年来，蒋介石集团曾“屡接美国公私方面提议遴选中国故宫博物院古艺术品运美展览”。去年秋天，蒋介石集团指派叶公超和王世杰在华盛顿与美国政府接洽，非法进行这一卖国勾当。据蒋帮发言人的谈话，中国科学院考古研究所（解放前的中央研究院历史语言研究所考古组和北平研究院历史研究所考古组）在台湾的一部分安阳铜器、石器等珍贵古物，这次也将被盗运往美国。
    我国北京故宫博物院、南京博物院、中国科学院考古研究所和南京图书馆等机构的珍贵文物，在解放前被蒋介石集团运了五千多箱去台湾。十多年来，对于这批属于我国人民所有的珍贵瑰宝，美国帝国主义一直垂涎欲滴。1955年曾由美国费城艺术博物馆副馆长霍勒斯·杰恩出面，“建议”蒋介石集团以“长期出借”的方式，让美国把在台湾的我国重要文物和图书运走，并且无耻地说美国劫运我国这些珍藏“是一种不可逃避的国际义务”。消息传出以后，激起了我国人民普遍的愤慨和抗议，美国侵略者才暂时缩回了贪婪的黑手。现在，美帝国主义假借“展览”为名准备派军舰把大批我国珍贵文物从台湾运走，显然是在推行它蓄谋已久的劫夺计划。但是，这批在台湾的我国珍贵文物，都是中国人民的财产，美国勾结蒋介石集团企图加以劫夺，完全是非法的。这种昭然若揭的卑鄙阴谋，只能加深我国人民对美帝国主义的愤慨和仇恨。这批珍贵文物不论被劫到天涯海角，中国人民一定要全数把它追回来。
