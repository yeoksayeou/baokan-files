A Whirlwind Two Years
Great Changes in the Hongzhuan People's Commune in Hami, Xinjiang

	Backward Township Transformed into a Red Banner Commune

The Hongzhuan People's Commune in Hami County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, is composed of the original eight agricultural cooperatives of Wubao Township, with a total of 823 households and 4,200 people, all of whom are Uygur. Wubao Township is more than 150 li away from the county seat and is relatively remote. The terrain is low-lying and the climate is hot, with early-maturing crops capable of two harvests a year. There are more than 50,000 mu of arable land, mainly irrigated by melting snow from the Tianshan Mountains, suitable for planting sorghum, wheat, cotton, and melons and fruits. This is a grain-producing area famous for sorghum, especially known throughout the county as the "Land of Melons and Fruits."

However, before liberation, the vast number of farmers here suffered under the cruel rule and exploitation of feudal landlords, living ignorant and backward lives, cultivating less than 8,000 mu of land with extremely low yields. Every year, during the lean season, people relied on eating mulberries and melons to stave off hunger. Many people rode donkeys to other places to farm and work odd jobs. After liberation, through a series of democratic reform movements such as rent reduction and anti-hegemony, land reform, and under the guidance of the Party's mutual aid and cooperation policy, the broad masses of farmers resolutely embarked on the road of collectivization. In the winter of 1955, elementary cooperatives were established; in the spring of 1957, advanced cooperatives were established. Collectivization greatly promoted agricultural development, and people's lives were generally improved. However, agricultural cooperatives were, after all, small and weak, and could not meet the masses' demands for accelerating the development of a new socialist countryside. They were unable to carry out large-scale water conservancy projects, could not make good use of resources to develop diversified operations, the contradictions between poor and rich teams, and poor and rich cooperatives could not be resolved quickly, there were many scattered plots of land, crop rotation could not be implemented, and labor and water were wasted. All of these factors restricted the continued development of agricultural productivity. In August 1958, everyone enthusiastically discussed merging cooperatives, organizing canteens, establishing nurseries, and running sewing factories. Just at this time, the Beidaihe Conference, which had epoch-making significance, announced the "Resolution on the Establishment of People's Communes in Rural Areas," which truly gave the farmers of Wubao Township a ladder to heaven. The entire countryside was seething, people couldn't sleep, and they demanded the establishment of people's communes, with more than 2,000 applications from collectives, individuals, and families. Thus, the Hongzhuan People's Commune was born.

Since the Party put forward the general line for socialist construction in 1958, especially after the establishment of the people's commune, Wubao Township has undergone profound changes, and is no longer known for backwardness, but for its progress. Now, the Hongzhuan People's Commune has become a red banner in the Hami area.

The changes in Wubao Township in the past two years have been astonishing. In the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, the grain output of the Hongzhuan Commune reached 4.2 million jin, an increase of more than 47% compared to 1957, and more than four times the total grain output in 1950, the early days of liberation. In 1959, the first year after communization, the total grain output of the commune reached 5 million jin, an increase of 800,000 jin compared to 1958. The increase in grain production in the past two years is roughly equal to the total increase in the eight years since liberation. In 1957, Wubao Township sold about 140,000 jin of surplus grain to the state; in 1958, it reached 870,000 jin; and in 1959, it sold 1.17 million jin, and planned to sell another 100,000 jin. After deducting rations, seeds, feed, and public grain, the commune still had 600,000 jin of reserve grain in 1959. In terms of the total income of the commune, the final accounts for 1957 were 372,000 yuan, which increased to 497,000 yuan in 1958, and the income in 1959 was 950,000 yuan. The actual distribution to commune members in 1957 was 235,000 yuan, which increased to 280,000 yuan in 1958, and the expenditure on food and wages for commune members in 1959 reached 353,000 yuan, and the total distribution for the year could reach 420,000 yuan.

The tremendous changes in Wubao Township in the past two years are a brilliant victory for the Party's general line and the result of the Great Leap Forward. It proves that the people's commune has taken root and blossomed, and is bearing rich fruit.

	Working Together to Build Water Conservancy

Water is the lifeblood of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. In the past two years, the cultivated land in Wubao Township has increased by more than 2,500 mu, and the grain yield per unit area has increased from 245 jin to 400 jin, mainly because the people's commune has vigorously built water conservancy projects and improved water management.

The establishment of the people's commune fundamentally solved the water disputes that had existed in Wubao Township for generations, so that water was used rationally.

The Hongzhuan People's Commune includes the two villages of Sibao and Wubao. A stream of water flowing down from Baiyanggou in Sanbao had flowed from Sibao to Wubao for hundreds of years, barely supporting the people of the two villages. Sibao was upstream, and Wubao was downstream. When the water was high, the upstream suffered floods, and when the water was low, the downstream suffered droughts. For many years, the two villages fought over water, causing many deaths and bloodshed, and forging deep blood feuds. Sibao and Wubao did not intermarry, and relatives and friends broke off contact. It was not until the rent reduction and anti-hegemony campaign in 1951 after liberation that the water dispute was initially resolved after several months of consultation. As old contradictions were resolved, new contradictions continued to arise. The eight agricultural cooperatives scrambled to irrigate their own land, and commune members also stole water to irrigate their private plots and orchards, resulting in serious waste of water. This situation did not change until 1958. Especially after the establishment of the people's commune, a farmland irrigation team was established under the unified leadership of the commune, and a system of watering according to the actual needs of crops was implemented, which fundamentally solved the water disputes here. This greatly saved water and ensured the expansion of cultivated land area.

After the establishment of the commune, the small collective was transformed into a large collective, breaking down the boundaries and creating conditions for large-scale farmland water conservancy construction. After the establishment of the Hongzhuan People's Commune, the commune uniformly organized a water conservancy company of 108 people, using 20 large carts, and began the first large-scale water conservancy construction jointly undertaken by the two villages of Sibao and Wubao in hundreds of years in the cold winter. The two water diversion canals caused by water disputes in Sibao and Wubao were merged into a main canal with a total length of 21 kilometers. More than 120 kilometers of branch canals were also built. The entire project involved nearly 130,000 cubic meters of earth and stone, costing a total of more than 46,000 workdays. The amount of earth and stone for water conservancy projects built by the Hongzhuan Commune in the six months after its establishment was more than the total amount of earth and stone for water conservancy projects built by the original eight agricultural cooperatives from 1956 to September 1958. During the construction of this main canal, the masses braved wind and snow, and the daily excavation of earth reached 12 cubic meters from the fixed quota of 3 cubic meters. Some elderly people were moved to tears. They said, "In the past, the two families of Sibao and Wubao often fought for water. Now they are working together to build a large canal. This is all due to the good leadership of the Communist Party, and the people's commune has brought us harmony and happiness."

In order to further adapt to the needs of vigorously reclaiming land in the future and completely eliminate the disasters of upstream floods and downstream droughts, the Hongzhuan Commune, with the strong support of the state, has recently begun to build a large reservoir with a storage capacity of 9.7 million cubic meters, in addition to continuing to rebuild old canals. After the reservoir is built, it can increase the irrigated area by 22,000 mu, and it is expected to be completed in May of this year.

	Great Development of Diversified Economic Undertakings

The Wubao Basin is like a treasure bowl, but in the past, due to the limitations of manpower and material resources, the wealth of this treasure bowl was rarely tapped. After the establishment of the commune, the commune was large and powerful, and the scope of activities was wide, which greatly promoted the development of various industries. The commune's diversified operations include four major categories: industry, sideline occupations, gardens, and animal husbandry, with more than 30 items. In 1959, the income in this area reached 450,000 yuan, while in 1958, the income in this area was only 53,601 yuan.

After the establishment of the Hongzhuan Commune, industry developed rapidly. The commune established a farm tool repair and assembly plant, which greatly promoted agricultural production. In the past, if a double-shared plow broke a screw, one had to travel more than 100 li to Hami for repairs. Now it's different. The commune's farm tool repair and assembly plant can not only repair various new farm tools, but also trial-produce tractor trailers, double-wheeled double-shared plows, single-body plows, brake pots, and ball bearings. It also modified the seeder and the tractor-drawn three-body plow to meet the needs of deep plowing and close planting. The commune has newly purchased two tractors and a boiler-locomotive, and general parts for the machines can also be made by itself. In the past year, the farm tool repair and assembly plant has repaired a total of more than 10,800 pieces of various large and small new and old farm tools, machinery, and utensils, including 600 large farm tools, with a total output value of 37,000 yuan. The Hongzhuan Commune established a gypsum factory shortly after its establishment, mining more than 10,000 tons of gypsum, worth more than 800,000 yuan, of which 4,000 tons have been sold, with an income of 320,000 yuan.

In addition, the commune has also organized light industries and food processing such as leather and fur processing, sewing, boots and shoes, vinegar making, brewing, and oil pressing. It has made full use of local resources to brew Hami melon wine, mulberry wine, and apricot wine to supply the living needs of commune members. This was impossible in the advanced cooperative. At that time, commune members had to go to Hami to buy even vinegar.

The commune's horticulture has achieved unprecedented development and harvest. The entire township originally had more than 30,000 fruit trees and more than 400 mu of grapes, almost all of which were planted decades ago. In the first year of the commune's establishment, more than 7,000 new fruit trees and 130 mu of grapes were planted, and 14 mu of peach and apricot seedlings were cultivated. The Hami melon fields were expanded from 176 mu in 1955 to 1,093 mu. In 1959, the major teams established horticulture groups, carefully cultivated, and greatly improved the yield of melons and fruits. Moreover, the commune vigorously organized the sales of melons and fruits. From May 1959, the commune transportation team's carts, donkeys, and camels carried various fruits to the cities, totaling more than 220,000 jin. The commune also dried a large number of peach preserves, apricot preserves, melon strips, and raisins. It is estimated that the horticulture aspect can generate an income of 80,000 yuan in 1959, double that of 1958.

	Increased Income and Greatly Improved Living Standards

Before liberation, Wubao Township was short of food for four months of the year. In 1949, the per capita income was only about 30 yuan per year. After liberation, people's lives gradually improved, but some households with few laborers and many people were still short of food. After the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the continued Great Leap Forward after communization, grain production greatly increased. The commune implemented a distribution system that combined supply and wage systems, which ensured a steady increase in the lives and incomes of commune members. In 1957, the average per capita income in the township was 88 yuan and 6 jiao; in 1958, it was 118 yuan and 4 jiao; and in 1959, it reached 235 yuan, 7 jiao, and 1 fen. Excluding public grain and production costs, the per capita distribution portion was 55 yuan and 9 jiao in 1957, 66 yuan and 7 jiao in 1958, and reached more than 120 yuan in 1959.

The increase in commune members' income is also reflected in the growth of people's purchasing power. The sales of goods in 1957 were 72,000 yuan; in 1958, they reached more than 145,000 yuan; and from January to August 1959, they sold more than 177,000 yuan. In the four months of the peak season before the year, they can sell at least another 80,000 to 100,000 yuan. Now, every young woman has one or two new dresses; it is very common for men to wear poplin and rayon shirts. Although this is a remote place, now there are "iron horses" (commune members' term for bicycles) running everywhere.

The commune has launched a large number of public welfare undertakings, which have never been seen in history. The entire commune runs 40 public canteens, 7 kindergartens, and more than 20 nurseries. The canteens issue tickets according to the grain retention standard, and meals are based on tickets. Savings are returned to the individual. Whenever there are rest days or holidays, the canteens improve their meals, and commune members can also take the flour and oil back to make their own food. The brigade also regularly slaughters sheep for sale. Everyone praises the commune: "Food is supplied, babies are taken care of, and you can eat ready-made meals when you come back from work, and there is a monthly wage!"

Cultural life and hygiene work have also greatly developed after communization. The commune has established a hospital with wards, delivery rooms, and ten beds, with four doctors and nurses. If you are sick, you no longer have to go to Hami for treatment, and women can also stay in the hospital to give birth. The commune established a post office, and all major teams have telephones. The commune also set up a wired broadcasting network and installed 28 loudspeakers, so that this remote area can hear the voices of Beijing, Urumqi, and all parts of the country at any time. Cultural education is popularized, and children's education is guaranteed. All school-age children are enrolled in school. The two primary schools have 699 students. The commune has also set up two middle school classes on its own after its establishment. The commune has also established an amateur cultural troupe and a bookstore. Commune members can see one to two performances a month based on real people and events. After work, in the fields, under the trees, and by the streams, people can be seen singing and dancing to the rhythm of hand drums everywhere.

	Changing Old Habits and Establishing New Customs

After the establishment of the people's commune, a new atmosphere appeared in the formerly backward Wubao Township, and there have been great changes in social customs and people's mental outlook.

The first thing is that xenophobia has disappeared, and new relations have emerged between ethnic groups. In the past, xenophobia here was very serious. The father of Muhemaitibaikeli was from Turpan. Thirty years ago, when he wanted to settle in Wubao, he could not marry a wife (he eventually went back to marry a relative), and he never bought a piece of land, a room, or a fruit tree. Now, this situation has changed greatly. In July 1957, young people from Jiangsu who came to support the border areas arrived here. The local commune members vacated the best houses for them to live in, and also gave them vegetable plots, melon fields, and vineyards. Usually, they often visit each other, just like relatives.

The second thing is that women go to the fields. In the past, women here rarely went to the fields, partly because they were burdened with housework, and partly because it was said to be "inauspicious," and "if women went to the threshing floor, the grain would be less." After the establishment of the commune, this old rule was broken. Now, most of the field management is done by women, and women can do everything from threshing, repairing canals, accumulating fertilizer, and plowing. The commune has six tractor drivers, four of whom are women. If you dare to say a word that belittles women, you will be immediately refuted.

The third thing is that the patriarchal system is shaken. The commune pays wages to individuals, which fundamentally shakes the old rules that patriarchs have exercised all power for thousands of years. In one household, the husband, Ahemoula, earned 14 yuan in wages in two months, while the wife, Ajianhan, earned more than 17 yuan, so the husband was much more polite to his wife.

The fourth thing is that idlers have disappeared. In the past, there were the most idlers here, who smoked, fought, and drank at a young age. Due to socialist and communist education, especially after the communization implemented a new distribution system, the idlers changed their original bad habits, participated in labor, and transformed themselves into new people.

The fifth thing is the formation of new marital relations. In the past, due to economic and cultural backwardness, marriage and divorce here were extremely casual. With the development of the economy and the improvement of people's ideological awareness, the phenomenon of hasty marriage and divorce has gradually decreased, and couples can respect and love each other and help each other. At the same time, the phenomenon of early marriage is gradually decreasing.

Sixth, the commune members' labor enthusiasm has been very high. After the people's commune, commune members lined up to sing songs when going to and from work, repaired canals in the twelfth lunar month, and pressed green manure in the summer, not afraid of the heat and cold, and did what they said.

In short, the whirlwind-like tremendous changes in the Wubao Basin in the past two years vividly and powerfully embody the correctness of the conclusion put forward in the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning the People's Commune" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party: the people's commune is like the rising sun, with infinitely powerful vitality. In just two years, the achievements of the Hongzhuan Commune in Wubao Township in terms of production development and living standards have surpassed the great achievements of the eight years since liberation, and these eight years are equal to the achievements of the hundreds of years before liberation. This cannot but be said to be a historical miracle.

    风驰电掣两年间
    新疆哈密红专人民公社的大变化
    中共哈密地委工作组  段进贤　乌斯曼　范成渠
          落后乡变成了红旗社
    新疆维吾尔自治区哈密县红专人民公社是由五堡乡原来的八个农业社组成的，共八百二十三户，四千二百人，都是维吾尔族。五堡乡距县城一百五十余里，比较偏僻；地势低洼，气候炎热，早熟作物一年可收两次；可耕土地有五万余亩，主要靠天山融雪灌溉，适宜种植高粱、小麦、棉花和瓜果。这里是个盛产高粱的粮产区，尤以瓜果之乡驰名全县。
    但是解放前，这里广大农民受尽了封建地主残酷的统治和剥削，过着愚昧落后的生活，种着不足八千亩土地，产量极低。每年青黄不接的时候，人们就靠吃桑子和瓜果充饥，有不少人骑着毛驴到外地和别人伙种地，作零工。解放后，经过了减租反霸、土地改革等一系列民主改革运动，广大农民在党的互助合作政策的指导下，坚决地走上了合作化的道路。1955年冬，实现了初级形式的合作化；1957年春，实现了高级形式的合作化。合作化大大促进了农业的发展，人民生活也得到了普遍的提高和改善。但是，农业社毕竟是社小力量小，与群众加速社会主义新农村发展的要求不相适应：无力大规模地兴修水利，不能很好地利用资源来发展多种经营，穷队与富队、穷社与富社的矛盾不能很快解决，插花地很多，不能实行轮作，浪费劳动力，浪费水。所有这些，都束缚着农业生产力的继续发展。1958年8月，大家热烈酝酿着并大社，组织食堂，成立托儿所，办缝纫厂。正当这个时候，有着划时代意义的北戴河会议公布了“关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议”，这真是给了五堡乡农民登天堂的天梯。整个农村沸腾了，人们觉也睡不着，纷纷要求成立人民公社，集体、个人、家庭的申请书达两千多份，红专人民公社就这样产生了。
    自1958年党提出社会主义建设的总路线，特别是成立人民公社后，五堡乡发生了深刻的变化，不再以落后出名，而是以先进出名了。现在，红专人民公社已经成为哈密地区的一面红旗。
    两年来五堡乡的变化是惊人的。大跃进的1958年，红专公社粮食的产量达到四百二十万斤，比1957年增长了47％强，为解放初1950年粮食总产量的四倍多。公社化后的第一年，1959年，全社粮食总产达五百万斤，比1958年又增产了八十万斤。两年来粮食增产数约等于解放八年来增产的总和。1957年五堡乡向国家出售余粮约十四万斤，1958年就达到八十七万斤，1959年出售余粮一百一十七万斤，还计划再出售十万斤。除去口粮、种籽、饲料和公粮外，全社1959年还有六十万斤的贮备粮。从全社的总收入来看，1957年决算为三十七万二千元，1958年增加到四十九万七千元，1959年收入九十五万元。1957年社员实际分配为二十三万五千元，1958年增加到二十八万元，1959年社员伙食和工资支出达到三十五万三千元，全年总分后可以达到四十二万元。
    五堡乡两年来的巨变，是党的总路线的光辉胜利，是大跃进的成果。它证明人民公社已经扎根开花，并结出丰硕之果。
            同心协力　大兴水利
    水是新疆各族人民的命根子。两年来，五堡乡耕地增加了二千五百余亩，粮食单位面积产量由二百四十五斤提高到四百斤，主要是因为人民公社大力兴修了水利和改进了水利管理。
    人民公社的成立，根本解决了五堡乡世世代代存在的水利纠纷，使水得到了合理使用。
    红专人民公社包括四堡和五堡两个村子。从三堡白杨沟流下的一道水，几百年都是从四堡流向五堡，紧紧巴巴地养活着两个村子的人。四堡在上游，五堡居下游，水大上游闹洪水，水小下游闹旱荒。多少年来两个村子为争水死了许多人，流了很多血，结下了血海深仇。四堡和五堡不通婚，亲戚朋友断了交往。直到解放后1951年减租反霸时，经过了好几个月的磋商，水利纠纷才初步获得了解决。旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又不断发生。八个农业社各抢浇自己的地，社员也偷水浇自己的自留地和果园，浪费水的现象十分严重。这种情况，直到1958年才有了改变。特别是在人民公社化以后，成立了由公社统一领导的农田灌溉队，实行了按作物实际需要浇水的制度，才根本解决了这里的水利纠纷。这就大大节约了用水，保证了耕地面积的扩大。
    公社成立后，由小集体转为大集体，打破了地界，为大规模兴修农田水利创造了条件。红专人民公社成立以后，由公社统一组织了一百零八个人的水利连，用二十部大车，在腊月寒天开始了数百年来四、五堡两村头一次共同进行的大规模的水利建设，将四、五堡由于水利纠纷而造成的两条分水渠，合成全长二十一公里的一条干渠。另修支渠一百二十多公里，全部工程挖土、石方近十三万方，共花了四万六千多个劳动日。红专公社成立后半年内兴修水利的土、石方量，比原来八个农业社从1956年至1958年9月前兴修水利的土、石方量总和还要多。在修这条干渠中，群众冒着风雪，每天挖土方由定额三方达到十二方。有些老年人感动得流了泪，他们说：“过去四、五堡两家为水常打架，现在在一起同心协力修大渠，这都是共产党的好领导，是人民公社给我们带来的和睦和幸福。”
    为了进一步适应今后大力开荒造田的需要，彻底消除上洪下旱的灾害，红专公社在国家的大力支援下，除了继续改建旧渠以外，最近又开始修建一个可蓄水九百七十万立方米的大水库。这个水库修好后可增加灌溉面积二万二千亩，预计今年5月竣工。
            多种经济事业大发展
    五堡盆地就像个聚宝盆，但是过去由于人力物力各方面条件的限制，这个聚宝盆的财富很少被挖掘出来。公社成立后，社大力量大，活动范围广，大大促进了各业的发展。这个公社的多种经营有工业、副业、园林、牧业等四大类，三十多项。1959年这方面的收入达到四十五万元，而1958年这方面的收入才有五万三千六百零一元。
    红专公社成立以后，工业得到了迅速发展。公社建立了农具修配厂，大大促进了农业生产。在过去，一部双铧犁坏了螺丝就得跑一百多里到哈密去修理。现在不同了，公社的农具修配厂不但可以修理各种新式农具，而且试制成拖拉机拖车、双轮双铧犁、单体犁、煞车锅和滚珠轴承，并改装了播种机和拖拉机曳三体犁，适应了深耕密植的需要。公社新买了两部拖拉机、一个锅驼机，机器上一般零件也都可以自己配制。一年来，农具修配厂修理了各种大小新旧农具、机具和用具共一万零八百多件，其中，修理大型农具六百件，总产值达三万七千元。红专公社成立不久就建立了石膏厂，共采石膏一万多吨，价值八十多万元，现已出售四千吨，收入三十二万元。
    此外，公社还组织了皮毛加工、缝纫、靴鞋、制醋、酿酒、榨油等轻工业和食品加工，充分利用本地资源酿出了哈密瓜酒、桑子酒和杏子酒，供应社员的生活需要。这在高级社时是办不到的，当时社员们就连吃醋也要到哈密去买。
    公社的园艺获得了数百年来未有过的大发展和丰收。全乡原有三万余株果木和四百余亩葡萄，它们几乎都是几十年前栽培的。公社成立的第一年，就新栽培了七千多株果树和一百三十亩葡萄，培育了十四亩桃、杏树苗。哈密瓜田由1955年的一百七十六亩扩大到一千零九十三亩。1959年各大队成立了园艺组，精心培育，大大提高了瓜果的产量。并且，公社大力组织瓜果的外销。从1959年5月起，公社运输队的大车、毛驴和骆驼驮载各种水果运往城市，计二十二万余斤。公社还晒制了大批桃脯、杏脯、瓜干和葡萄干等。预计园艺方面，1959年可收入八万元，比1958年增加了一倍。
          收入有增加　生活大改善
    解放前，五堡乡每年缺四个月口粮，1949年每人的收入，全年平均不过三十元左右。解放后，人民生活逐步有了提高，可是还有些劳动力少、人口多的户缺口粮。经过1958年的大跃进和公社化后的继续大跃进，粮食大大增产，公社实行了供给制和工资制相结合的分配制度，这就保证了社员的生活和收入有稳定的增长。1957年全乡每人平均收入为八十八元零六角，1958年为一百一十八元零四角，1959年达到二百三十五元七角一分。除去公粮、生产费用以外，每人分配部分1957年为五十五元零九角，1958年为六十六元零七角，1959年达到一百二十多元。
    社员收入的增加，还表现在人们购买力的增长方面。商品销售额1957年为七万二千元；1958年达到了十四万五千余元；1959年1至8月就销了十七万七千余元，在年前四个月的旺季中起码能再销八万至十万元。现在，每个年轻妇女都有一件到两件新衣裙；男人们穿府绸、纺绸衬衣已经十分平常。虽然这里是个偏僻的地方，现在却有“铁马”（社员对自行车的称呼）到处跑。
    公社举办了大量公共福利事业，这是历史上从来没有过的。全公社办了四十个公共食堂，七个幼儿园，二十多个托儿所。食堂是按留粮标准发票，凭票吃饭，节约归己。每逢休息日或假日，食堂改善伙食，社员也可以把面、油领回去自己作。大队还经常宰羊出售。大家称赞公社是：“吃饭供给制，娃娃有人管，劳动回来就吃现成饭，每月还有工资钱！”
    文化生活和卫生工作在公社化以后也有很大的发展。公社建立了医院，有病房、产室，还有病床十张，医生、护士四人。有病再不要到哈密治疗，妇女生孩子也可以住医院。公社建立了邮电局，各大队通了电话。公社还架起了有线广播网，安装了二十八个喇叭，使这个遥远偏僻的地区随时可以听到北京、乌鲁木齐和全国各地的声音。文化教育普及，儿童受教育有保障，适龄儿童全部入学，两所小学的学生已达六百九十九人，公社在成立后又自办了两班中学。公社还建立了业余文工团、书店，社员每月可以看到一至二次以真人真事为题材的演出。劳动之余，田间、树下和溪旁，到处都有人引亢高歌和随着手鼓的节奏翩翩起舞。
          改变旧习惯　树立新风气
    人民公社成立后，过去落后的五堡乡出现了一片新气象，社会风气和人们的精神面貌都有很大改变。
    第一件，排外情绪消逝了，民族之间出现新关系。过去，这里的排外情绪非常严重。木合买提白克里的父亲是吐鲁番人。三十年前，他想在五堡落户，竟娶不上妻子（最后还是回去娶了亲），也一直未买到一块地，一间房，或一株果树。现在，这种情况已大有改变。1957年7月，江苏支援边疆青年到了这里，当地社员把最好的房子腾出来给他们住，还分给了菜地、瓜田和葡萄园。平时，他们常互相串门拜访，就像是亲戚一样。
    第二件，女人下田。过去这里女人很少下田，一方面是因为家务缠身，另一方面是因为据说“不吉利”，“女人上了麦场，粮食就打得少了”。成立公社后，这个陈规被打破了。现在，田间管理大部分都靠妇女，女人打场、修渠、积肥、犁地样样都能干。公社有六个拖拉机手，其中就有四个是女的。你如果敢说句轻视妇女的话，马上就会遭到反驳。
    第三件，家长制度动摇。公社发工资给个人，这就从根本上动摇了几千年来家长行使一切主权的老规矩。有一户，丈夫阿合毛拉两个月挣了十四元工资，而妻子阿尖汗却挣了十七元多，因此丈夫对妻子说话也客气多了。
    第四件，二流子绝迹。过去这里二流子最多，年纪小小的就抽烟、打架、喝酒。由于进行了社会主义和共产主义教育，特别是公社化后实行了新的分配制度，二流子都改变了原有的坏毛病，参加了劳动，改造成为新人。
    第五件，新的夫妻关系的形成。过去由于经济、文化落后，这里结婚、离婚极其随便。随着经济的发展和人们思想觉悟的提高，轻率结婚、离婚的现象已经逐渐少了，夫妻之间能互敬互爱，互相帮助。同时，早婚现象正在逐步减少。
    第六件，社员的劳动热情一直很高。在人民公社化后，社员上工下工排队唱歌，腊月修水渠，夏天压绿肥，不怕酷热严寒，说干就干。
    总之，五堡盆地两年来风驰电掣般的巨变，生动而有力地体现了党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中所提出的论断的正确：人民公社像初升的太阳，具有无限强大的生命力。仅仅两年，五堡乡红专公社在生产的发展和生活的提高上的成就，就超过了解放后八年来的巨大成就，而这八年又等于解放前几百年的成就。这不能不说是历史上的奇迹。
