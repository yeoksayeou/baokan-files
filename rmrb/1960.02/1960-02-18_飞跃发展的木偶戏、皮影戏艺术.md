    The puppet show and shadow play performance organized by the Ministry of Culture has come to a victorious conclusion. Although only twelve professional troupes from ten provinces and cities participated in this performance, the more than fifty plays performed have already excitingly demonstrated that, under the banner of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art, and illuminated by the leadership of the Party and the general line, China's puppet show and shadow play arts have made leaps and bounds in the past decade, especially since the Great Leap Forward of 1958. This performance presented a picture full of revolutionary enthusiasm, with a hundred flowers blooming and beautifully moving the audience. The ancient puppet show and shadow play arts have gained new life and taken on a new look.
    Many plays have good themes and strong artistic merit, with sharp conflicts and vivid characters, and moving plots. The themes and styles of the plays are diverse, and the art forms are fresh and lively, and are loved by the masses.
    Chinese puppet shows and shadow plays have a long history, rich heritage, diverse forms, and are full of characteristics. Some puppet shows have as many as seven or eight hundred traditional plays, and some shadow plays have three to five hundred traditional plays. Before liberation, due to the contempt of the reactionary ruling class, the social status of the artists was low, and their lives were difficult. The puppet show and shadow play arts were also on the verge of extinction. After liberation, under the attention and care of the Party and the government, puppet shows and shadow plays were reborn. After vigorous development, not only have many traditional plays appeared before the audience with new faces, but also many new plays with fairy tales, fables, myths, historical themes, and folk stories have been created and adapted. Such as "Picking Mushrooms," "The Affectionate Crane," "The Three Liu Brothers," "Old Li with the Stub Tail," "The Monkey King Borrows the Banana Fan Three Times," "Fairy Hibiscus," "Havoc in Heaven," "Flaming Mountains," "Two Friends," "The Turtle and the Crane," "Planting Radishes," "The Golden Scale Story," "The Story of the Forest," "The Flood of Jinshan Temple," "Sima Guang," "Righteous Beheading of the Evil Dragon," "Li Kui Wreaks Havoc in Tokyo," "Bao Caiwen's Marriage Substitution," "Stopping the Horse," and "Mr. Dong Guo," "Splitting Mount Hua," "Qian Fanglan's Marriage Substitution," and "拦马" [Stopping the Horse]. Some reflect the patriotism of the ancient working people; some reflect their diligence, bravery, wisdom, tenacious spirit to overcome difficulties, and their steadfast love.
    Puppet shows and shadow plays reflecting modern struggle life are new creations. Many troupes have liberated their minds, dared to think and act, and created and performed many programs that praise the general line, the Great Leap Forward, the People's Commune, and the revolutionary struggles of the people. Such as "Night Battle on Lotus River," "Little Steel Hero," "Wedding in the Nursing Home," "The Road of Innovation," "Cold Protection Record," "Presenting Treasures," "Celebrating a Bumper Harvest," "Hu Er Takes a Car," and "Celebrating the Spring Festival." Some express the great enthusiasm of the Chinese people for socialist construction through the story of the People's Commune's large-scale steelmaking; some express the love of the people all over the country for our great leader Chairman Mao from different aspects of life; some depict the magnificent picture of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production; some praise the superiority of the People's Commune and the new people and new things and collectivism in the technological innovation movement, and criticize conservative backwardness and selfish self-interest. There are also plays such as "Liberating Yijiangshan Island," "Fisherman's Song on the Sea," "Returning Home in a Stormy Sea," "Railway Guerrillas," and "Wisely Capturing the Living Yan Wang" which very vividly express the invincible power of the People's Liberation Army, express the people's love and defense of the socialist motherland, and the heroic and witty victorious struggle against the enemy, and praise the revolutionary heroes of the land revolution and the anti-Japanese war.
    The artistic quality of many plays is also relatively strong. The literary scripts have high writing skills and create vivid character images. Many troupes, according to the needs of the script content, not only comprehensively use the strengths of art, drama, lighting, scenery, music, dance, recitation, and other arts; but also comprehensively use the various strengths of puppets and shadow puppets in performance; therefore, they can create vivid and colorful stage images and more deeply express the characters' thoughts and emotions. In the creation of modern themes, puppet shows and shadow plays do not lack difficulties, but because these plays can fully utilize the characteristics of puppets and shadow puppets, innovate the characters' shapes, create new performance techniques, and fully use music and singing, they can more delicately express the characters' emotions. Therefore, they can cleverly express new life and new character images.
    Some troupes, according to their own conditions and the needs of the script content, in addition to using opera forms, also boldly tried dramas (such as "Railway Guerrillas," "Tall Ivan," etc.), children's operas (such as "Presenting Treasures," etc.), song and dance and fast talk (such as "Celebrating the Spring Festival," etc.), as well as mimes with musical accompaniment or recitation (such as "Two Friends," "The Affectionate Crane," etc.). Some plays highlight singing and speaking, and some plays highlight dancing and martial arts, each with its own characteristics and unique style. Greatly enriching the art forms and art styles of puppet shows and shadow plays.
    In terms of character modeling and lighting and scenery, many troupes, according to the needs of the script content, absorbed and comprehensively used the characteristics of sculpture, paper-cutting, painting, and other arts, and created various realistic, exaggerated, patterned, or cartoon-style character models, so that the puppets and shadow puppets produced beautiful and realistic effects during the performance. At the same time, the art workers also created scenery that was both realistic and three-dimensional and full of fantasy colors, making the performance unique and fascinating.
    In order to better create vivid and moving stage images, many troupes have also worked hard to improve, enrich and improve the operation technology of puppets and shadow puppets with the improvement and improvement of engraving technology, the changes and richness of character modeling. In this way, the mutual combination of various art forms and technical expressions greatly enriched and improved the expressive power of puppet shows and shadow plays.
    This performance also showed that the ranks of puppet shows and shadow plays are growing and expanding. The political, cultural, artistic, and technical levels of puppet show and shadow play workers have generally improved. Many people have become glorious Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. More than 100 Party members and League members participated in this performance, accounting for about one-third of the total number of people. Many people used to be illiterate, but now they can read books and write articles. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, under the leadership of the Party, politics has taken command, mass movements have been carried out on a large scale, and a large number of advanced figures and new puppet show and shadow play writers, directors, actors, art, music, lighting and production talents have emerged. These include veteran artists, adults, teenagers, drama, music workers and mass amateur enthusiasts. The newly trained young actors are already a force to be reckoned with.
    The combination of puppet show and shadow play art and puppet show and shadow play workers with the masses has also become closer. Audiences and amateur enthusiasts are greatly increasing. Professional puppet show and shadow play workers go to the mountains and countryside, to factories, and labor, live and work with the masses, and work hard to study and improve their ideological awareness.
    The unprecedented prosperity of puppet show and shadow play plays, the innovation of art and the richness and improvement of expressive power, the growth and expansion of the team, and the combination with the masses have all provided favorable conditions for puppet shows and shadow plays to better serve socialism, and give them broad prospects for development. China's socialist construction is advancing at a high speed, and puppet shows and shadow plays must continue to make a Great Leap Forward in order to better serve socialism. Therefore, we must continue to implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, weeding through the old to bring forth the new," serving proletarian politics, socialist construction, and workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as the policy of combining popularization and improvement, and combining professional and amateur work. Art workers must study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, continue to go to the mountains and countryside, further integrate with the masses, and firmly establish a proletarian worldview. According to needs and possibilities, we will continue to carry out amateur puppet show and shadow play activities with adults, teenagers, children, etc. in communes, factories, organs, schools, etc. Professional puppet show and shadow play workers should also strive to improve their cultural, artistic, and technical levels; strive to study, practice, critically inherit excellent traditions, boldly innovate and create, and further improve the ideological and artistic quality of the plays; and strive to create new plays with high ideological content and as perfect artistic forms as possible that reflect various themes, especially those suitable for children and teenagers, whether they are myths, fairy tales, fables, historical stories, folk stories, and other themes. On the one hand, we must continue to work hard to excavate, sort out, and perform excellent traditional plays; at the same time, we should continue to put a lot of effort into creating and performing plays on modern themes. We must give full play to the positive role of various styles, genres, art forms, and art expression techniques. The work of training young successors must be carried out in a more planned way. We must give full play to the diverse characteristics of puppet shows and shadow plays; give full play to the strengths and active roles of various troupes, professional puppet show and shadow play workers, amateur enthusiasts, drama, and music workers.

    飞跃发展的木偶戏、皮影戏艺术
    李纶
    文化部举办的木偶戏、皮影戏观摩演出已经胜利结束了。参加这次观摩演出的虽然只有十个省、市的十二个专业剧团。但从演出的五十多个剧目来看，也已经令人兴奋地看到，在毛主席文艺思想的旗帜下面，在党的领导和总路线光辉照耀下，我国的木偶戏、皮影戏艺术，在十年当中，特别是1958年大跃进以来，已经有了飞跃的发展。这次演出，在观众面前展现了一幅充满革命热情的、百花争艳、优美动人的图画。古老的木偶戏、皮影戏艺术获得了新的生命，面貌焕然一新。
    很多剧目的主题思想好，艺术性强，剧中矛盾冲突尖锐，人物性格鲜明，剧情动人。剧目的题材、风格多种多样，艺术形式新鲜活泼，为群众所喜闻乐见。
    中国木偶戏、皮影戏历史悠久，遗产丰富，形式多样，富于特色。有的木偶戏传统剧目达七、八百个，有的皮影戏传统剧目也有三、五百个。解放前由于反动统治阶级的蔑视，艺人的社会地位低，生活困难。木偶戏、皮影戏艺术也奄奄一息，濒于灭亡。解放后，在党和政府的重视和关怀下，木偶戏、皮影戏获得了新生。经过大力发展，不但许多传统剧目以新的面貌出现在观众面前；同时还创作和改编了许多新的童话、寓言、神话、历史题材和民间故事的剧目。如参加这次观摩演出的“采蘑菇”、“温情的鹤”、“刘氏三兄弟”、“秃尾巴老李”、“孙悟空三调芭蕉扇”、“芙蓉仙子”、“大闹天宫”、“火焰山”、“两朋友”、“龟与鹤”、“种萝卜”、“金麟记”、“森林的故事”、“水漫金山”、“司马光”、“仗义斩孽龙”、“李逵闹东京”、“暴采文”、“东郭先生”、“劈华山”、“钱芳兰代嫁”、“拦马”等。有的反映了古代劳动人民的爱国主义思想；有的反映了他们的勤劳、勇敢、智慧、顽强地克服困难的精神，以及他们的坚贞的爱情。
    反映现代斗争生活的木偶戏、皮影戏是新的创造。不少剧团解放思想，敢想敢做，创作和演出了许多歌颂总路线、大跃进、人民公社，歌颂人民革命斗争的节目。如“夜战莲花江”、“钢铁小英雄”、“敬老院的婚礼”、“革新的道路”、“防寒记”、“献宝”、“喜庆丰收”、“胡二坐车”、“闹春节”等。有的通过人民公社大炼钢铁的故事表现了我国人民进行社会主义建设的高度热情；有的从不同的生活侧面表现了全国人民对我们伟大的领袖毛主席的热爱；有的描绘了农业生产大跃进的壮丽图景；有的歌颂了人民公社的优越性和技术革新运动中的新人新事和集体主义精神，批判了保守落后和自私自利思想。还有像“解放一江山岛”、“海上渔歌”、“怒海归舟”、“铁道游击队”、“智捉活阎王”等剧目则非常生动地表现了人民解放军无坚不摧的伟大力量，表现了人民热爱和保卫社会主义祖国，英勇机智地向敌人进行的胜利斗争，歌颂了土地革命和抗日战争时期的革命英雄人物。
    不少剧目的艺术性也是较强的，文学脚本有较高的编剧技巧，创造了性格鲜明的人物形象。不少剧团根据剧本内容的需要，不但综合地运用了美术、戏剧、灯光、布景、音乐、舞蹈、朗诵等艺术的长处；还综合运用了木偶人、皮影人在表演上的各种长处；因此能够创造出生动活泼、有声有色的舞台形象，比较深刻地表现了人物的思想情感。在表现现代题材的创作方面，木偶戏、皮影戏不是不存在着困难，但因为这些剧目能够充分发挥木偶、皮影的特点，革新了人物的造型，创造了新的表演技巧，同时充分运用了音乐、歌唱，能够比较细致地表现了人物感情，因此，能够巧妙地表现了新的生活和新的人物形象。
    有些剧团根据自身的条件和剧本内容的需要，除了运用戏曲形式外，还大胆地尝试了话剧（如“铁道游击队”、“高大的伊凡”等）、儿童歌剧（如“献宝”等）、歌舞和快板（如“闹春节”等），以及有音乐伴奏或朗诵的哑剧（如“两朋友”、“温情的鹤”等）。有的剧目突出了唱和说，有的剧目突出了舞蹈、武打，各有特色，自成一格。大大地丰富了木偶戏、皮影戏的艺术形式和艺术风格。
    在人物造型和灯光布景方面，很多剧团根据剧本内容的需要，吸收并综合运用了雕塑、剪纸、绘画等艺术的特点，创造了各种写实的、夸张的、图案式的或漫画式的人物造型，使木偶人、皮影人在表演时产生了又好看又逼真的效果。同时，美工人员也创造了既有真实感、立体感而又富有幻想色采的布景，使演出别具特色，引人入胜。
    很多剧团为了更好地创造性格鲜明、优美动人的舞台形象，随着刻制技术的改进、提高，人物造型的变化和丰富多样，也努力改进、丰富和提高了木偶、皮影的操作技术。这样，各种艺术形式和技术表现手法的互相结合，就大大地丰富和提高了木偶戏、皮影戏艺术的表现力。
    这次观摩演出还表现了木偶戏、皮影戏的队伍正在成长、壮大。木偶戏、皮影戏工作者的政治、文化、艺术、技术水平普遍有所提高。不少人成为光荣的共产党员和共青团员。参加这次观摩演出的党、团员就有一百多人，约占总人数的三分之一。不少人过去是文盲，现在已经能够看书写文章。特别是大跃进以来，在党的领导下，政治挂了帅，大搞群众运动，涌现出大批先进人物和新的木偶戏、皮影戏剧作者、导演、演员、美术、音乐、灯光和制作人材。这里面有老艺人、成年人、青少年，有戏剧、音乐工作者和群众业余爱好者。新培养的青少年演员已经是一支不可忽视的力量。
    木偶戏、皮影戏艺术和木偶戏、皮影戏工作者同群众的结合，也更为密切了。观众和业余爱好者都在大大增加。专业木偶戏、皮影戏工作者上山下乡下工厂，与群众一起劳动、生活和工作，并且努力学习，提高了思想觉悟。
    木偶戏、皮影戏剧目的空前繁荣，艺术的革新和表现力的丰富、提高，队伍的成长壮大，与群众的结合，都为木偶戏、皮影戏更好地为社会主义服务提供了有利的条件，使它们有着宽广的发展前途。我国的社会主义建设正以高速度飞跃前进，木偶戏、皮影戏必须继续大跃进才能更好地为社会主义服务。因此，我们必须继续贯彻“百花齐放，推陈出新”，为无产阶级政治、为社会主义建设、为工农兵服务的方针，以及普及与提高结合、专业与业余结合等两条腿走路的方针。艺术工作者必须学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东著作，继续上山下乡，进一步与群众结合，巩固地树立无产阶级的世界观。根据需要与可能，继续在公社、工厂、机关、学校等开展有成人、青少年、儿童等参加的业余木偶戏、皮影戏活动。专业木偶戏、皮影戏工作者还要努力提高文化、艺术和技术水平；努力学习、实践，批判地继承优秀的传统，大胆地革新创造，进一步提高剧目的思想、艺术质量；努力创作具有高度思想性和尽可能完美的艺术形式的反映各种题材，特别是适合儿童、少年需要的新剧目，无论是神话、童话、寓言、历史故事、民间故事等题材的剧目都应重视。一方面要继续努力挖掘、整理、上演优秀的传统剧目；同时也应继续在创作与演出现代题材的剧目方面花很大的力量。要充分发挥各式各样风格、体裁、艺术形式、艺术表现手法的积极作用。培养青年接班人的工作，必须更有计划地进行起来。必须充分运用木偶戏、皮影戏的形式多样的特点；充分发挥各剧团，专业木偶戏、皮影戏工作者、业余爱好者、戏剧、音乐工作者的专长和积极作用。
