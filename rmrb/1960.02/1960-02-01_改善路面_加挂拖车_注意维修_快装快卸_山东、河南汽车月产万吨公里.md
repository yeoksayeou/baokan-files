　　(Our report) Shandong Province's highway transportation department workers, full of enthusiasm, overcame wind and snow, and in December of last year, the province's average monthly freight car ton-kilometer output reached 10,341, a record that is more than double that of the Great Leap Forward year of 1958.

　　Shandong Province's transportation industry is relatively developed, with long railway lines, many ports, and long waterways. However, highway automobile transportation distances are short, with the province's average highway car transportation distance only reaching 39 kilometers, which greatly increases loading and unloading time. Moreover, 70% of the province's roads are dirt roads, passable in good weather but obstructed by rain, coupled with old vehicles. These are all unfavorable conditions for highway automobile transportation. To enable highway automobile transportation to better serve industry, agriculture, commerce, and basic construction, the Shandong Province highway automobile transportation leadership department took effective measures, improving road surfaces and laying wearing courses for more than 1,500 kilometers, and improving roadbeds for more than 2,000 kilometers last year, greatly improving transportation conditions. In addition, based on the above characteristics, they focused on rapid loading and unloading and vehicle maintenance. In rapid loading and unloading, the province widely promoted the advanced experience of "one ton does not exceed one minute" (loading and unloading one ton of goods does not exceed one minute), adopting methods such as loading before unloading and double-sided loading and unloading to accelerate vehicle turnover. In terms of vehicle maintenance, the method of on-vehicle maintenance was widely implemented, and the manufacturing of spare parts and the repair of old parts were strengthened, thus greatly improving the quality of vehicle maintenance and ensuring normal transportation. At the same time, two-shift or multi-shift transportation was implemented, and the experience of train towing was promoted. Currently, 70% of the province's vehicles are double-shift, and an average of one vehicle is towing two trailers; the utilization rate of trailers has reached over 70%. This has greatly tapped the potential of existing transportation tools.

　　(Our report) In December 1959, the Henan Province highway transportation department successfully achieved "safety, economy, and a monthly output of 10,000 ton-kilometers per vehicle," with the province's average monthly freight car ton-kilometer output reaching 10,707, an increase of 62.04% compared to the highest month of October 1959, and exceeding the average monthly output of 1958 by 1.47 times. A total of 580,000 liters of fuel were saved throughout the month.

　　The Henan Provincial Party Committee and local Party committees' strengthening of leadership over transportation work is the fundamental guarantee for the province's highway transportation to achieve high output. In order to quickly break through the weak link of transportation work, the Henan Provincial Party Committee put forward the call to achieve "a 10,000 ton-kilometer province" at the industrial secretary meeting in August last year. Subsequently, the Party committees of various regions and cities were headed by secretaries, with commissioners, mayors, and county heads personally directing and assigning responsibilities at all levels. The Luoyang Prefectural Party Committee was headed by the secretary and formed a leading group for transportation work. The Qinyang County Party Committee secretary personally led the masses in early December to rush repairs on individual poor-quality sections of the Jiao (zuo)-Ji (yuan) line, cutting off the "blind intestine" section and greatly improving the quality of the highway. At a time when transportation tasks were very tight, heavy snow fell twice throughout the province. The Provincial Party Committee immediately issued the instruction to "sweep snow after snow, and lay sand after rain, to ensure the smooth flow of major routes." People's communes along the routes mobilized 100,000 people to sweep snow and spread sand on various major trunk lines, so that, except for a very small number of cars traveling in deep mountainous and steep areas that temporarily stopped, most cars were still running smoothly.

　　In creating high output achievements, all transportation companies have closely grasped several important aspects such as operating more double shifts, towing more trailers, strengthening cargo source organization, and improving scheduling work. Xuchang Transportation Company also created a circular scheduling method, turning short-distance into long-distance and one-way transportation into two-way transportation, greatly improving vehicle ton output.

    改善路面　加挂拖车　注意维修　快装快卸
    山东、河南汽车月产万吨公里
    本报讯　山东省公路运输部门广大职工，干劲冲天，战胜了风雪严寒，去年12月份全省货运汽车车吨月产量平均达到一万零三百四十一吨公里，这个纪录比大跃进的1958年还提高了一倍以上。
    山东省的交通运输业比较发达，铁路线长，港口多，航道长。但是，公路汽车运输运距短，全省公路汽车的运距平均只达三十九公里，这样装卸车的时间就大大增加了；而且全省公路中，有70％是土路，晴通雨阻，再加上车辆破旧。这一些都是公路汽车运输的不利条件。为了使公路汽车运输更好地为工业、农业、商业和基本建设服务，山东省公路汽车运输领导部门，采取有效措施，去年一年中就改善公路路面和铺筑磨耗层一千五百多公里，改进路基两千多公里，大大改善了运输条件。此外，还根据上述特点，大抓快速装卸和车辆的维修保养工作。在快速装卸中，这个省普遍推广了“吨不过分”（装卸一吨货物不超一分钟）先进经验，采取先装后卸和两面装卸等办法，加速了车辆周转。在车辆的维修保养方面，普遍实行了就车保修方法，并加强了配件制造和旧件修复工作，因此大大提高了车辆检修质量，保证了正常运输。同时，还实行了两班运输或多班运输，推广了列车拖挂经验。目前，这个省的双班车达到70％，并且平均做到一车两挂；挂车利用率达到70％以上。这就大大地挖掘了现有运输工具的潜力。
    本报讯　河南省公路运输部门在1959年12月份胜利地实现了“安全、节约、车吨月产万吨公里”，全省载货汽车平均车吨月产达到一万零七百零七吨公里，比1959年最高的10月份增长62．04％，超过1958年平均车吨月产的一点四七倍。全月共节约用油五十八万公升。
    中共河南省委和各地党委加强对交通运输工作的领导，是全省公路运输夺得高产的根本保证。为了迅速突破交通运输工作这个薄弱环节，中共河南省委在去年8月工业书记会议上，提出了实现“万吨公里省”的号召。接着各地、市委都是书记挂帅，专员、市长、县长等亲自指挥，层层分工包干负责。洛阳地委由书记挂帅，组成了交通运输工作领导小组，沁阳县委书记在12月初亲自领导群众，抢修焦（作）济（源）线个别质量差的路段，割掉了“盲肠”路段，大大提高了公路质量。正当运输任务十分紧张的时候，全省各地两次普降大雪，省委当即发出“雪后扫雪、雨后铺沙，保证主要路线畅通”的指示，沿线各人民公社曾出动了十万群众，在各个主要干线上扫雪撒沙，从而使全省除了极少数行驶在深山陡坡地区的汽车曾暂时停车以外，绝大部分汽车仍然畅行无阻。
    各个运输公司，在创造高产成绩中，都紧紧抓住了多开双班、多拖挂、加强货源组织与改进调度工作等几个重要环节。许昌运输公司还创造了循环调度法，使短途变长途，单程运输变双程运输，大大提高了车吨产量。
