    New Style
    Mao Zhenya
    Recently, I saw two things in the newspaper: One was that a soldier of the People's Liberation Army hired a pedicab. On the way, the pedicab driver suddenly suffered from a stomach ailment. The PLA comrade asked him to sit in the seat, pedaled the pedicab himself to take him home, and paid the fare. The other was that a worker from the Dalian Industrial and Mining Vehicle Factory came to a farm tool manufacturing factory in a people's commune in Lüda. He enthusiastically introduced his work experience, helped improve tools, and improved work efficiency. After returning, he sent a large package of machine parts that were very needed for production to this factory. Later, it was learned that this uninvited guest was a representative attending the National Congress of Heroes.
    Anyone who sees these two things cannot help but be deeply moved. These are small things that we often encounter in our new society. However, from them, we once again saw the radiant and lofty communist style.
    One manifestation of the communist style is caring for others, treating the difficulties of others as one's own, just like that soldier of the People's Liberation Army.
    Another manifestation of the communist style is helping others, collaborating with each other, learning from each other, and making progress together, just like that worker who came as an "uninvited guest."
    Of course, there are more than these forms of expression of the communist style, but no matter what the form of expression, it can be seen from the new style: not counting remuneration, not seeking honor, wholeheartedly helping others, in order to achieve common progress. This is the new type of relationship between people in the new society. This new style makes individuals and collectives twist into one, and promotes our socialist cause to move forward continuously!

    新的风格
  　毛震亚
  　最近在报上看到两件事：一则是一位解放军雇了一辆三轮车，途中三轮车工人忽发胃病，解放军同志便叫他坐在座位上，自己蹬车送他回家，并给了车资。另一则是旅大一个人民公社的农具制造厂里来了一位大连工矿车辆厂的工人，热情地介绍自己的工作经验，帮助改进工具，提高了工作效率，回去后还给这个厂寄了一大包生产上很需要的机器零件。后来才知道这位不速之客是出席全国群英会的代表。
    这两件事，任何人看了都不能不深为感动。这是我们新社会里经常碰到的小事，然而，我们从他们的身上，再一次看到了光芒四射的、崇高的共产主义风格。
    共产主义风格表现之一是关心别人，把别人的困难看作自己的困难，就像那位解放军一样。
    共产主义风格表现之二是帮助别人，彼此协作，互助学习，共同进步，就像那位当“不速之客”的工人一样。
    自然，共产主义风格的表现形式不止这些，但是不管表现形式如何，从新风格中可以看出：不计报酬，不求荣誉，一心帮助别人，以达到共同进步，这是新社会中人与人之间的新型的关系。这种新风格，使个人和集体拧成一体，促使我们社会主义事业不断前进！
