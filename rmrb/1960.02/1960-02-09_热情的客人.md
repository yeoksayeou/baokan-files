    Enthusiastic Guest
    Not long ago, our agricultural tool manufacturing plant in Gezhenbao People's Commune, Dalian-Luda City, received a guest in the machine shop. This guest's name was Lu Shenghe, a worker from the Dalian Industrial and Mining Vehicle Factory.
    This "colleague" was very humble, and Master Chen Shiqing from our workshop quickly became friends with him.
    The guest toured our workshop and, seeing that the belt lathe had low horsepower and slow feed, he enthusiastically shared his experience in increasing the speed. He then took down the cutting tool, sharpened it on the grinding wheel, and adjusted the angle of the tool; when used again, the tool indeed moved much faster. He noticed that our workshop needed a homemade electric welding machine, so he tore a few pages from his diary and drew a simple structural diagram of a welding machine for us, also telling us how to make it. He saw that we were lacking a No. 95 gear wheel when machining screws for agricultural tools, and noted it down in his diary. This Comrade Lu stayed in our workshop for a day, without resting for a moment.
    Three days later, our Master Chen received a large parcel. He opened it and found a No. 95 gear wheel, a standard knife, a diagram of a homemade electric welding machine, a "conversion table" for calculations, and a letter. The letter read: If you have any problems in the future, and need our help, we will do our best to meet your requirements. Please call or write to us often, and I will definitely visit you often when I have time.
    Later, we learned that this "colleague" was a famous technical innovation expert who had attended the National "Heroes' Conference." That day, he was visiting us on his day off. His enthusiasm for actively supporting agricultural technical transformation and his communist spirit of wholeheartedly helping others deeply moved us.

    热情的客人
    不久前，我们旅大市革镇堡人民公社农具制造厂机械车间来了一位客人。这位客人名叫芦盛和，是大连工矿车辆厂的工人。
    这位“同行”十分谦逊，我们车间的陈士庆师傅很快就和他交上了朋友。
    客人参观了我们的车间，看到皮带车床的马力小、走刀慢，他就热情地介绍了提高车速的经验。他又把车刀卸下来，拿到风轮上磨了磨，改了下刀的角度；再用时，果然刀具就走得很快了。他发现我们车间需要一个土电焊机，就从日记本上撕了几页纸，为我们画了一张结构简单的电焊机草图，还告诉我们怎样制作。他看到我们车制农具上的螺丝时缺一种九十五号的牙轮，就记在日记本上了。这位芦同志在我们车间作客一天，一刻也没有休息。
    三天后，我们的陈师傅接到了一个大邮包。他打开一看，里面有一个九十五型的牙轮，一把标准刀，一份土电焊机的图纸，一份计算用的“换算表”，还有一封信。信上写着：今后有什么问题，需要我们帮助，只要我们能做到的，一定尽力满足你们的要求。请常来电话或写信联系，我有空也一定常到你们那里去。
    后来，我们才知道这位“同行”是曾经出席全国“群英会”的著名的技术革新能手。那一天，他是利用公休日来访问我们的。他的积极支援农业技术改造的热情和热心帮助别人的共产主义风格，使我们很受感动。
