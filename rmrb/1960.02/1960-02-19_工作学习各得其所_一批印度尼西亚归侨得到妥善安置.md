Xinhua News Agency, 18th: More than 700 returned overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese students who returned from Indonesia in January this year have been properly resettled by the government according to national needs and individual aspirations, and have successively embarked on production or study posts. Those who voluntarily returned to their hometowns have also successively returned to their homes to settle down.

More than 130 returned overseas Chinese have been assigned to participate in production at the Xinglong in Guangdong, Wuming in Guangxi, and Changshan in Fujian state-owned overseas Chinese farms. When these new returnees arrived at the farms, the farm members welcomed them with gongs and drums and held grand welcoming ceremonies for them. The three farms have housed the new returnees in newly renovated and fully furnished houses, and have promptly and properly arranged their work according to their respective specialties and labor capabilities. Machine repair worker Li Minghua and hardware worker Yu Deli were assigned as technicians to the farm's comprehensive factory and citronella processing factory, respectively, after arriving at the Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm in Guangdong. Huang Yahua, Huang Yasi, Liu Dexing, and other 40 returned overseas Chinese who had more than ten years of experience in planting coffee and pepper, were asked by the farm director to rest for a few more days after arriving at the Wuming Overseas Chinese Farm in Guangxi, which specializes in developing subtropical cash crops. However, when they saw the boundless fertile land and heard the sound of tractors, they were all very excited and no one could sit still. They took the initiative to help the old farm members with their work. Zheng Jinshi, a returned overseas Chinese who was persecuted and destitute in Indonesia, was properly resettled with his family of ten after arriving at the Changshan Overseas Chinese Farm in Fujian. He himself could drive and repair cars, so the farm arranged for him to work in the mechanical work team; his wife and two eldest daughters did not have technical expertise, so they participated in weeding, digging cogon grass roots, and other labor within their capabilities; and the six younger daughters were sent to nurseries or primary schools for free.

Among these returned overseas Chinese, some are skilled workers and have been assigned to work in factories and enterprises in Guangdong, Guangxi, and other places. Lathe technician Wu Zuyin, welder Huang Yaguang, driver Chen Shiji, and more than 20 other skilled workers have been assigned to work in the Maoming Petroleum Company of Guangdong, the Automobile Repair and Assembly Plant of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee, the Guangzhou Iron and Steel Experimental Factory, and the Guangdong Provincial Transportation Bureau. Li Shier, Li Anjun, and 17 other skilled workers with electrical and mechanical repair skills have been assigned to work in the Nanning Power Plant and automobile repair plant in Guangxi.

More than 240 overseas Chinese students who returned with this batch of overseas Chinese have been assigned to study at the Overseas Chinese Students' Preparatory Schools in Beijing, Jimei in Fujian, Shantou in Guangdong, and Guangzhou. After more than 100 overseas Chinese students who went to the Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Students' Preparatory School enrolled, the school organized them to visit factories and people's communes, and from February 1st, they began to tutor them in the second semester's lessons according to the classes they originally attended.

    工作学习各得其所
    一批印度尼西亚归侨得到妥善安置
    据新华社18日讯　今年1月间从印度尼西亚回国的七百多名华侨和华侨学生，已经由政府根据国家需要和个人志愿妥善安置，陆续走上生产或学习岗位。自愿回乡的也已经陆续回乡安家。
    有一百三十多名归国华侨被分别安置到广东兴隆、广西武鸣、福建常山等三个国营华侨农场参加生产。这些新归侨到达农场时，农场场员们敲锣打鼓欢迎他们，并为他们举行了盛大的欢迎会。这三个农场都把新归侨安置在修缮一新、家具齐全的房屋里居住，并按照各人的特长和劳动能力，及时妥善地安排了他们的工作。机器修理工人黎明华和五金工人余德力，在到达广东兴隆华侨农场后，便被分别安置在农场的综合工厂和香茅加工厂当技工。有十多年种植咖啡、胡椒经验的黄亚华、黄亚四、刘德兴等四十名归国华侨，在到达专门发展亚热带经济作物的广西武鸣华侨农场后，农场场长要他们多休息几天，可是当他们看到一望无际的沃野，听到哒哒的拖拉机马达声，都非常兴奋，谁也闲不住，就主动帮助老场员干活。在印度尼西亚遭到迫害生活无着的归侨郑金狮，到达福建常山华侨农场后，一家十口都得到了妥善安置。他自己会驾驶和修理汽车，农场就安排他在机械工作队工作；他的妻子和两个大女儿没有技术专长，便参加了除草、挖茅根等力所能及的劳动；六个小女儿被免费送托儿所或小学读书。
    在这些归国华侨中，有一些是技术工人，已被分别安置到广东、广西等地的工厂企业中就业。车床技工吴祖荫、电焊技工黄亚光、汽车驾驶员陈世基等二十多名技术工人，被分别安置到广东茂名石油公司、广东省人民委员会汽车修配厂、广州钢铁实验工厂、广东省交通运输局等单位工作。有电工和机械修理技术的李拾贰、李安均等十七名技术工人，被分别安置到广西南宁市电厂、汽车修理厂工作。
    同这批归国华侨一起回国的二百四十多名华侨学生，已分别到北京、福建集美、广东汕头和广州等地归国华侨学生中等补习学校就学。到广州归国华侨学生中等补习学校的一百多名华侨学生入学后，学校组织他们参观访问了工厂和人民公社，并从2月1日开始，按照他们原来就读的班级辅导他们补习第二学期的功课。
