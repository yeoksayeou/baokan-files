Latin American Common Market Problems
Zhang Ye

During Eisenhower's recent visit to South America, he expressed his "hope to cooperate with Latin American countries" in establishing a Latin American Common Market. In a television broadcast speech before his visit, he also advocated that Latin America "needs a regional common market to improve efficiency and attract new loans."

The idea of establishing a Latin American Common Market was originally proposed by the bourgeoisie of some Latin American countries. They believe that establishing such a regional common market can help better utilize and allocate production resources, strengthen economic cooperation between countries, overcome the crisis of limited domestic markets, and rely on their own strength to develop national industries and the entire economy, thereby reducing the economic dependence of various countries on the United States. Because it is the common aspiration of the public in Latin American countries to get rid of the current widespread serious economic difficulties, overcome economic stagnation and isolation, and accelerate national economic development, the proposal to establish a Latin American Common Market has received quite broad support in Latin American countries.

The issue of establishing a Latin American Common Market has been the focus of discussions at Pan-American conferences since 1956. Initially, the U.S. ruling clique was not interested in this issue. Later, seeing the strong desire of Latin American politicians and business people to establish a Latin American Common Market, it felt that it would be detrimental to U.S. monopoly capital if the United States did not participate. Therefore, the United States changed its attitude, actively expressed its support, and tried to intervene in order to tamper with the original plans of Latin American countries and make the Latin American Common Market conform to the U.S. goal of controlling the Latin American economy.

The United States actively supports the establishment of a Latin American Common Market, first of all, to control the proposed common market through a payment alliance, because a payment alliance is a necessary condition for the existence of a common market. A report published by the Rockefeller Foundation in June 1958 recommended the establishment of a Pan-American Payment Alliance, with the United States providing the largest share of capital to the payment alliance and becoming a member of the alliance. U.S. monopoly capital attempts to force Latin American countries to abandon supervision of import and export trade and abolish their control over foreign exchange conversion through this payment alliance, in order to facilitate the penetration and plunder of U.S. monopoly capital. Secondly, if a common market without tariff barriers is established among Latin American countries, U.S. monopoly capital can carry out economic penetration through its enterprises established in some Latin American countries and further打击拉丁美洲的民族工业 [strike Latin American national industries]. Thirdly, U.S. monopoly capital also harbors a more important political conspiracy, using the establishment of a common market as a way to divert Latin American countries' struggle for economic independence, to distract these countries and lead them away from the path of thoroughly solving economic difficulties.

However, it is not easy for U.S. monopoly capital to realize this plan.

First, the national bourgeoisie of Latin American countries have irreconcilable contradictions with U.S. monopoly capital. The national bourgeoisie strive to independently develop their national economies, especially industry, while U.S. monopoly capital believes that this independent development will shake its dominance in Latin America. U.S. monopoly capital is doing its utmost to prevent the development of the national economies of Latin American countries. Therefore, the contradiction between the national bourgeoisie of Latin American countries and U.S. monopoly capital is irreconcilable, and as the strength of the national bourgeoisie of Latin American countries develops, the contradiction between them will inevitably become increasingly acute.

Second, there are also contradictions among the national bourgeoisie of Latin American countries, mainly the contradictions between the more industrialized countries and the backward countries, as well as the national bourgeoisie of countries that produce the same single product. The establishment of a common market will create a monopoly position for the bourgeoisie of certain Latin American countries in the market, develop the monopoly capital of these countries, and damage the interests of the national bourgeoisie of other countries, forcing some countries to stop the production of a series of products.

Third, and more importantly, the patriotic forces of Latin American countries resolutely oppose the establishment of this Latin American Common Market with U.S. participation, which is beneficial to U.S. monopoly capital. The Uruguayan "People's Daily" once incisively called the "common market" a "colonialist plan for the American continent." This is because: First, the general national income of Latin American countries is currently very small, the living standards of the vast majority of people are very low, and the consumption volume of the domestic market is limited, making them unable to increase imports. Second, with the exception of a few countries, the industries of Latin American countries still lack various industrial sectors to meet the needs of the market. Third, Latin America is a raw material producing region, and many countries produce the same things, such as coffee, sugar, oil, lead, zinc, etc. These countries mainly rely on the U.S. market and are subject to U.S. manipulation in terms of prices. Their trade with each other accounts for only about 10% of the total foreign trade of Latin America. In the current situation where even the most developed capitalist countries are finding it difficult to sell their products and cannot absorb these raw materials, the Latin American Common Market will naturally have no way to solve the problem of selling these things. Fourth, most Latin American countries are experiencing financial and economic difficulties, and their foreign exchange reserves are exhausted. To increase imports, they must rely on foreign capital, mainly U.S. capital, but relying on U.S. capital will inevitably strengthen the control of the United States and those big capitalists and big plantation owners who collude with the United States. This control is detrimental to the economic development of Latin American countries.

The problem is very clear. Under the condition that the current semi-feudal and semi-colonial economic structure of Latin America has not been fundamentally changed, the establishment of a Latin American Common Market will not only fail to completely solve the economic problems of Latin America, but will instead bring more disasters due to facilitating the penetration of U.S. monopoly capital. Progressive people in Latin America believe that in order for this common market to truly play a constructive role, the following prerequisites must be met: (1) Get rid of the control and plunder of foreign monopoly capital, especially U.S. monopoly capital, over the national economies of Latin American countries, so as to create conditions for independent development of national economies; (2) Transform feudal or semi-feudal land relations, implement land reform that abolishes the big plantation system and distributes land to peasants, and develop diversified crop economies, so as to lay the foundation for developing national industries and expanding the domestic market; (3) Realize national industrialization in order to meet the needs of the Latin American market; (4) Get rid of U.S. control over the foreign trade of Latin American countries, and expand trade relations between Latin American countries and with all countries in the world, especially with countries in the socialist camp, in order to seek a broader and more stable market for Latin American countries' export commodities.

U.S. monopoly capital is actively planning to establish a Latin American Common Market for its own interests, but their activities are not smooth sailing. At the Pan-American Economic Conference held in Argentina from August to September 1957, and at the special meeting of representatives from Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Ecuador, and Colombia in February 1958 to discuss the establishment of a Latin American Common Market, Latin American countries opposed the establishment of a common market with U.S. participation. From May 14 to 23, 1959, the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America held its eighth session in Panama to discuss the establishment of a Latin American Common Market. A proposal drafted in advance by experts from the United States and Latin American countries was based on the Rockefeller Foundation's June 1958 report. According to this proposal, tariff and all trade restrictions between member countries participating in the proposed common market will be greatly reduced and eventually completely eliminated. The initial step is that one year after the plan takes effect, all participating countries must reduce their tariffs by 5%-10%. At the end of the ten-year "review" period of free trade zone activities, participating countries have an obligation to begin negotiations to implement economic integration by establishing a customs union. Countries should unite into a group according to the nature of their production. According to the industrial level of these countries, three groups of countries are designated to be established. Due to the contradiction between the United States and Latin American countries, the meeting did not reach any agreement, but only passed a decision at the trade subcommittee of the meeting, requesting relevant countries to appoint experts to continue to study this issue, and to draft a new plan for the establishment of a Latin American Common Market before the 11th Pan-American Conference to be held in 1960, so as to discuss it at this conference. However, the prospect of establishing a common market is still not optimistic, and even Raul Prebisch, the ardent advocate of the Latin American Common Market and Secretary-General of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, does not believe that it can be established quickly.

However, the United States does not give up its conspiracy to establish a Latin American Common Market. Before the establishment of a common market in the entire region, the United States is actively planning to establish two or three regional free trade zones in order to transition to a common market. This free trade zone has already been established in the mid-1958 among the five Central American countries of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. The seven South American countries of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Peru also signed a draft free trade zone agreement at the end of September 1959, and it was formally adopted at the seven-nation foreign ministers meeting this February. In addition, Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador have also signed an economic and technical cooperation agreement as an initial step in establishing a free trade zone. The presidents of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador held a meeting in January this year and decided to authorize the economic ministers of each country to sign a treaty establishing the Tri-National Economic Association one month later.

Because the common market is not a simple expansion of the free trade zone, but a much more complex institution, it not only abolishes tariffs and all measures that hinder the import of goods, but also requires the integration of all aspects of the national economy, including all fiscal revenues. With the rise of the Latin American national democratic movement and the intensification of contradictions between Latin American countries and the United States, the U.S. conspiracy to establish a Latin American Common Market will inevitably encounter greater and greater resistance.

    拉丁美洲共同市场问题
    章叶
    艾森豪威尔这次去南美访问时，表示“希望同拉丁美洲国家进行合作”，建立拉丁美洲共同市场。他在访问前夕的电视广播演说中，也鼓吹拉丁美洲“需要区域性共同市场来提高效率和吸引新的贷款”。
    成立拉丁美洲共同市场的主张，本来是拉丁美洲一些国家的资产阶级提出来的。他们认为，建立这样一个区域性的共同市场，可以有助于较好地利用和分配生产资源，加强各国之间的经济合作，克服有限的国内市场的危机，靠自己的力量发展民族工业和整个经济，从而减轻各国在经济上对美国的依赖。由于摆脱目前普遍存在的严重经济困难，克服经济上的停滞和隔绝状态，并加速国家的经济发展是拉丁美洲各国公众的共同愿望，因此，成立拉丁美洲共同市场的主张，在拉丁美洲各国中得到颇为广泛的支持。
    建立拉丁美洲共同市场问题，从1956年起就成了泛美会议讨论的中心。起初，美国统治集团对于这个问题并不感到兴趣，后来看到拉丁美洲政界和商界人士要求建立拉丁美洲共同市场的强烈愿望，它觉得如果美国不参加进去，那对于美国垄断资本是不利的。因此，美国就改变了态度，积极表示支持，并且力图插足进去，以便篡改拉丁美洲国家的原来计划，使拉丁美洲共同市场符合美国控制拉丁美洲经济的目的。
    美国积极支持建立拉丁美洲共同市场，首先是想通过支付同盟来控制拟议中的共同市场，因为支付同盟是共同市场存在的必需条件。洛克菲勒基金会在1958年6月公布的一份报告中就建议成立泛美支付同盟，由美国给支付同盟提供最大的一份资本，并成为同盟的一员。美国垄断资本企图通过这个支付同盟迫使拉丁美洲国家放弃对进出口贸易的监督，取消它们对外汇兑换的控制，以便于美国垄断资本的渗入和掠夺。其次，如果拉丁美洲国家间建立起没有关税壁垒的共同市场，美国垄断资本就可以通过它在一些拉丁美洲国家设立的企业进行经济渗入，进一步打击拉丁美洲的民族工业。第三，美国垄断资本还怀着更重要的政治阴谋，把成立共同市场作为一个转移拉丁美洲国家争取经济独立斗争的办法，来分散这些国家的注意力，使它们离开彻底解决经济困难的道路。
    但是，美国垄断资本要实现这个计划，并不是很容易的。
    第一，拉丁美洲各国的民族资产阶级同美国垄断资本有着难以调和的矛盾，民族资产阶级力图独立发展本国的经济，特别是工业，而美国垄断资本则认为，这种独立发展将会动摇它在拉丁美洲的统治地位。美国垄断资本竭力要阻止拉丁美洲国家民族经济的发展。因此，拉丁美洲各国民族资产阶级同美国垄断资本的矛盾是无法调和的，随着拉丁美洲国家民族资产阶级力量的发展，它们之间的矛盾势必日益尖锐化。
    第二，拉丁美洲各国民族资产阶级之间也存在着矛盾，主要是工业比较发达的国家同落后国家以及各个生产同样单一产品国家的民族资产阶级之间的矛盾。共同市场的建立，将会造成某些拉丁美洲国家资产阶级在市场中的垄断地位，发展这些国家的垄断资本，而损害到其他国家民族资产阶级的利益，使一些国家不得不停止一系列产品的生产。
    第三，更重要的是，拉丁美洲各国的爱国力量坚决反对成立这个有美国参加的、有利于美国垄断资本的拉丁美洲共同市场。乌拉圭“人民报”曾经一针见血地把“共同市场”叫做是
  “美洲大陆的殖民主义计划”。这是因为：一，目前拉丁美洲国家一般的国民收入很小，广大人民生活水平很低，国内市场的消费量有限，没有能力增加进口。二，除了少数几个国家外，拉丁美洲各国的工业还缺乏各种各样的工业部门来满足市场的需要。三，拉丁美洲都是原料生产国家，而且有不少国家生产同样的东西，如咖啡、食糖、石油、铅、锌等。这些国家主要依靠美国的市场，并在价格上受美国的操纵，它们相互间的贸易仅占拉丁美洲对外贸易总额的10％左右。在目前最发达的资本主义国家都对自己产品的销售感到困难，无法吸收这些原料，拉丁美洲共同市场自然也没有办法解决这些东西的销售问题。四，拉丁美洲各国大都是财政经济困难，外汇储备枯竭，要增加进口就必须依靠外国资本，主要是依靠美国资本，但是依靠美国资本就不可避免地加强美国和同美国相勾结的那些大资产阶级和大庄园主的控制。这种控制是不利于拉丁美洲各国的经济发展的。
    问题很清楚，在拉丁美洲目前的半封建半殖民地性质的经济结构没有根本改变的条件下，拉丁美洲共同市场的建立，不但不能彻底解决拉丁美洲的经济问题，反而会由于便利了美国垄断资本的渗入，给它带来更多的灾难。拉丁美洲的进步人士认为，为了使这个共同市场真正起建设性的作用，必须具备下述几个先决条件：（一）摆脱外国垄断资本，首先是美国垄断资本对拉丁美洲各国民族经济的控制和掠夺，以便创造独立发展民族经济的条件；（二）改造封建的或半封建的土地关系，实行废除大庄园制和把土地分给农民的土地改革，发展多种作物经济，以便为发展民族工业和扩大国内市场打下基础；（三）实现国家的工业化，以便满足拉丁美洲市场的需要；（四）摆脱美国对拉丁美洲各国对外贸易的控制，扩大拉丁美洲国家之间以及同世界各国，首先是同社会主义阵营各国之间的贸易关系，以便为拉丁美洲各国的出口商品寻求更为广大、稳定的市场。
    美国垄断资本为了自己的利益积极策划成立拉丁美洲共同市场，但是他们的活动并不是一帆风顺的。1957年8月到9月在阿根廷举行的泛美经济会议上，1958年2月巴西、墨西哥、智利、阿根廷、厄瓜多尔、多伦比亚六国代表讨论成立拉丁美洲共同市场的特别会议上，拉丁美洲国家都反对成立有美国参加的共同市场。1959年5月14日到23日，联合国拉丁美洲经济委员会在巴拿马举行了第八届会议，讨论成立拉丁美洲共同市场问题。美国和拉丁美洲国家的专家事先起草的一项建议书，是以洛克菲勒基金会1958年6月的报告作蓝本的。根据这项建议，参加拟议中的共同市场的成员国之间将大大削减而最后完全取消关税和一切贸易限制。初步采取的步骤是在这个计划生效一年后，所有参加国都要把自己的关税减少5％—10％。自由贸易区活动的十年“审查”期期满时，参加国有义务开始谈判通过建立关税同盟来实行经济联合的问题。各国应当按照它们的生产性质联合成一个集团。根据这些国家的工业水平，规定建立三个国家集团。由于美国和拉丁美洲国家之间存在着矛盾，会议没有达成任何协议，只是在这个会议的贸易小组委员会上通过一项决定。要求有关国家指定专家对这个问题继续进行研究，在1960年召开的第十一届泛美会议前，起草一个成立拉丁美洲共同市场的新方案，以便在这次会议上进行讨论。但是，成立共同市场的前景仍然不是乐观的，甚至拉丁美洲共同市场的狂热鼓吹者、联合国拉丁美洲经济委员会秘书长劳尔·普雷维什都不相信它可以很快建立起来。
    然而，美国并不放弃它的建立拉丁美洲共同市场的阴谋。在整个地区的共同市场建立以前，美国积极策划成立两三个区域性的自由贸易区，以便向共同市场过渡。这种自由贸易区已经在1958年年中在中美洲的危地马拉、洪都拉斯、萨尔瓦多、尼加拉瓜、哥斯达黎加五国建立起来。南美洲的阿根廷、巴西、智利、乌拉圭、玻利维亚、巴拉圭、秘鲁七国也在1959年9月末，签订了自由贸易区协定草案，并已于今年2月在七国外长会议上正式通过。此外，委内瑞拉、哥伦比亚、厄瓜多尔三个国家也签订了经济技术合作协定，作为建立自由贸易区的最初步骤。危地马拉、洪都拉斯和萨尔瓦多三国总统在今年1月举行会议，决定授权各国经济部长，在一个月之后签订一项建立三国经济协会的条约。
    由于共同市场并不是自由贸易区的简单扩大，而是一个复杂得多的机构，它不仅废除关税以及一切妨碍商品进口的措施，而且要求各国经济所有方面都要整体化，连各项财政收入都包括在内，随着拉丁美洲民族民主运动的高涨和拉丁美洲国家同美国的矛盾尖锐化，美国策划成立拉丁美洲共同市场的阴谋，必将遇到越来越大的阻力。
