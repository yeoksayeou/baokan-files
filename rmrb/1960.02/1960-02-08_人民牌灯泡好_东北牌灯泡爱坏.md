    "People" Brand Light Bulbs are Good;
    "Northeast" Brand Light Bulbs Break Easily
    I am a repair worker at the Fengtai Vehicle Depot of the Beijing Railway Bureau. When we repair trains, we sometimes need to crawl under or inside the carriages to operate, and we often need to use lights.

    The Northeast brand 32-volt, 100-watt light bulbs that our repair shop recently purchased from the Fengtai Materials Factory are of very poor quality. Twenty-six of them broke in just six days across our five lighting circuits. When they break, either they emit white smoke and are done, or the tungsten filament is burned through, or they become detached from the lamp holder. When we work the night shift, we always have to get some spare light bulbs ready.

    The "People" brand light bulbs of the same wattage, manufactured by the state-owned Shanghai Light Bulb Factory, are of very good quality. One light bulb often lasts for one or two months without breaking.

    I hope the Shenyang Light Bulb Factory will investigate the reasons for the poor quality of its light bulbs and quickly improve the quality of its light bulbs to better meet the needs of users. Chen Bingwen

    人民牌灯泡好
    东北牌灯泡爱坏
    我是北京铁路局丰台车辆段的修车工人。我们在修车时，有时需要钻到车下或车内去操作，常常要用灯。
    我们修车库最近从丰台材料厂买来的东北牌三十二伏、一百瓦的灯泡，质量太差了。我们的五挂灯线六天就坏了二十六个。坏的时候，不是一冒白烟就完，就是钨丝被烧断，或是从灯口处脱扣。我们做夜班时总得领些灯泡预备着。
    同样度数的国营上海灯泡厂制造的人民牌灯泡，质量就很好，一个灯泡常常使用一、两个月都不坏。
    我希望沈阳灯泡厂检查一下灯泡质量低劣的原因，迅速提高灯泡质量，以更好地满足用户的需要。　陈秉文
