From the Lin County Party Committee First Secretary Wang Dezhi: Since the beginning of winter, the people of Lin County, Shanxi Province, have achieved great success in their struggle to harness the mountains and rivers. 1.24 million mu of basic farmland throughout the county have been transformed into terraced fields on slopes and garden-like fields in the river valleys, with animal pens and fertilizer pits at the edges of the fields. The irrigated area has been expanded by more than 80,000 mu, one and a half times more than the original water fields. Now, the people of the county are continuing their efforts to complete the massive tasks ahead of schedule in 1960: afforesting 320,000 mu, planting autumn grass on 150,000 mu, building terraces on 200,000 mu, constructing 20,000 dams, digging 20,000 drought wells, and building 250,000 mu of irrigated land, thereby basically achieving water conservancy of the mountainous areas and controlling soil erosion.

Lin County, located west of the Yellow River, is a loess hilly area, with soil erosion accounting for 82% of its area. Cultivated land covers 1.57 million mu, of which 94% is mountainous. Due to steep slopes, barren land, and frequent droughts, agricultural production has been relatively backward. To fundamentally change the poor conditions in the mountainous areas, the county party committee, based on the requirements of the Party Central Committee for harnessing the Yellow River and the policy of building mountainous areas, has been conducting planned soil and water conservation since the cooperativization in 1955. Especially during the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, the county conscientiously implemented the principles of combining soil and water conservation with production, combining mountain management with water management, and combining engineering treatment with biological treatment. Adopting the principles of small-scale efforts during busy farming seasons, large-scale efforts during slack seasons, and emergency mobilization after rain, the county relied on the people's communes to launch an unprecedented mass movement for mountain management. Measures such as building field ridges, constructing terraces, planting trees, afforestation, planting grass, leveling land, building check dams, constructing reservoirs, and digging water cellars have been taken to initially manage 3.42 million mu of mountainous land, accounting for 92.4% of the eroded area. The area where soil does not run down the slopes and sediment does not leave the gullies has reached 1.74 million mu. A total of 940,000 mu of terraced fields have been built, averaging 3.4 mu per agricultural person. 80% of the area suitable for afforestation in the county has been planted with saplings, including 395 orchards, mulberry gardens, and forest farms of ten thousand, thousand, and hundred mu, transforming the previously barren mountains into places adorned with "poplars on the peaks, fruit trees around the waists, and mulberry trees along the edges." Due to the rapid development of mountain and water management work, the county's agricultural and sideline production has also undergone tremendous changes. Animal husbandry has greatly developed, with each household raising one pig and each person raising one sheep, and the Lin County donkey, famous throughout the province, has greatly increased in number. Before 1955, the average grain yield per mu was 47 jin, but in 1959, it increased to 172 jin, nearly tripling. In particular, the increased production from terraced fields was even more significant, and the county transformed from a grain-deficient area to a grain-surplus area. The masses said, "Terraced fields greatly increase production, making mountain land better than plains."

In the large-scale soil and water conservation work, the county party committee fully utilized the superiority of the people's communes. Based on the principles of overall planning and continuous management, it was proposed that 100-mu watersheds should be managed by production teams, 1,000-mu watersheds should be managed by management districts, 10,000-mu watersheds should be managed by communes, and the 200-li-long Qiushui River watershed should be managed by the county. Specific construction was carried out through extensive collaboration, concentrating efforts, and completing tasks rapidly. Experience has proven that centralized management and reasonable division of labor can both give play to the subjective initiative of grassroots leaders and facilitate mutual encouragement and promotion. Due to the promotion of the communist style and the implementation of the policy of equivalent exchange, various forms of cooperation emerged, with more than 780 collaborative projects among communes, districts, and teams.

In terms of management techniques, various localities have also created eight high-standard mountain management methods and have combined intensive management with year-round maintenance. These eight methods are: (1) Leveling nearby, gently sloping land into horizontal terraced fields as basic farmland, achieving terracing of slopes; (2) Using water cellars, kilns, reservoirs, drought wells, etc. on basic farmland to intercept and store all rainwater, while simultaneously diverting, pumping, and lifting river water and well water onto the mountains to build a mountain water conservancy network, achieving water conservancy of mountainous areas; (3) Selecting sunny places with water and grass to build mountain enclosures, ensuring that sheep go up the mountains and pigs go into the gullies, achieving animal pens at the edges of the fields, and universally establishing high-yield demonstration plots on the mountains, achieving high yields; (4) Planting pasture grasses on distant, barren mountain slopes, achieving the "five farms" (cattle, donkey, pig, sheep, bee) on the mountains, and adopting grass-crop rotation and soil improvement, achieving pasture base development; (5) Based on terrain and soil quality, building timber forests and economic forests on mountaintops, steep slopes, gully edges, roadsides, and distant mountains, achieving large-scale landscaping; (6) Building check dams in branch gullies, dams in main gullies, and terraces on steep slopes, achieving terrace transformation of gullies; (7) On fragmented terrain, using fish-scale pits to intercept mud and store water, planting grass and trees, achieving fish-scale development; (8) Building roads, with mountain roads built into winding mountain highways and flat roads built on basic farmland, achieving standardization of mountain roads. To do a good job in project maintenance, the county has established a professional team of more than 14,000 people responsible for long-term maintenance and key management.

    陡坡瘠地变良田
    临县水土保持工作经验丰富成绩大
    本报讯　临县县委第一书记王德滋报道：山西省临县人民从入冬开始的治山治水斗争，已取得巨大成绩：全县一百二十四万亩基本农田实现了坡地梯田化，川地园田化，地头畜圈肥坑化，扩大灌溉面积八万多亩，比原有的水地增加了一倍半。现在，全县人民正再接再厉，为1960年提前完成造林三十二万亩，种秋草十五万亩，修梯田二十万亩，打坝两万座，打旱井两万眼，修建水地二十五万亩，达到基本实现山地水利化和控制水土流失面积的巨大任务而奋斗。
    临县西靠黄河，属于黄土丘陵区，水土流失面积占82％；耕地一百五十七万亩，山地即占94％。由于坡陡地瘠，十年九旱，农业生产比较落后。为了彻底改变山区的贫困面貌，县委根据党中央提出的治黄要求和建设山区的方针，从1955年合作化后，就有计划地进行治山治水。特别是在大跃进的1958年和1959年，全县认真贯彻了水土保持和生产相结合、治山和治水相结合、工程治理和生物治理相结合的方针，采取了农忙小搞，农闲大搞，雨后突击的原则，依靠人民公社大搞群众运动，开展了空前规模的治山运动。采取培地埂、修梯田、植树、造林、种草、打地、筑谷坊、建水库、挖水窖等措施，初步治理了山地三百四十二万亩，占流失面积的92．4％；达到土不下坡，泥不出沟的面积一百七十四万亩。共计修成梯田九十四万亩，按农业人口计算，每人平均三亩四分。全县宜于造林的面积80％都已培植了树苗，其中万亩、千亩、百亩果园、桑园、林场有三百九十五个，把过去童山秃岭打扮成“杨树戴帽、果树缠腰、桑树镶边”的地方。由于治山治水工作获得迅速发展，全县农副业生产也有了巨大的变化。畜牧业大发展，猪达到每户一头，羊每人一只，驰名全省的临县驴大量增加。1955年前粮食平均亩产四十七斤，1959年提高到一百七十二斤，增加近三倍，特别是梯田增产更加显著，全县由缺粮变余粮。群众说：“梯田大增产，山地赛平川”。
    在大搞水土保持工作中，县委充分发挥了人民公社优越性。根据全面规划、连续治理的方针，提出百亩流域由生产队搞，千亩流域由管理区搞，万亩流域由公社搞，二百里长的湫水河流域由县搞。具体施工时实行广泛协作，集中力量，突击完成。经验证明，集中治理，合理分工，既能发挥基层领导的主观能动性，又便于相互鼓舞促进。由于发扬了共产主义风格，贯彻了等价交换的政策，出现了多种多样的协作形式，社、区、队的协作工程就有七百八十多处。
    治理技术上，各地还创造了八项高标准治山方法，并做到了突击治理和常年养护相结合。这八项方法是：（一）把近地、缓坡地一次修成水平梯田，作为基本农田，实现坡地梯田化；（二）在基本农田上用水窖、水窑、蓄水池、旱井等把天上水全部拦蓄起来，同时通过引、抽、吊把河水、井水引上山来，建成山地水利网，实现山地水利化；（三）选择向阳有水草的地方，打成山圈，做到羊上山、猪入沟，实现地头畜圈化，普遍建立山地丰产方，实现高产化；（四）在较远的瘠地山坡大种牧草，实现牛、驴、猪、羊、蜂“五场”上山，并采取草田轮作、改良土壤，实现牧草基地化；（五）根据地形土质，分别在山顶、陡坡、沟边、路旁、远山营造木材林和经济林，实现大地园林化；（六）在支毛沟筑谷坊，干沟打坝，陡坡立洼，修成条阶和台阶，实现沟壑川台化；（七）在破碎的地形上，用鱼鳞坑拦泥蓄水，种草种树，实现鱼鳞化；（八）修建道路，山地修成盘山公路，基本农田上建立平车路，实现山区道路规格化。为了做好工程养护，全县建立了一支一万四千多人的专业队伍，负责长期养护和重点治理。
