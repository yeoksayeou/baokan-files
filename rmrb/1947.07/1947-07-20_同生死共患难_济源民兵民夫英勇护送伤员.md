Sharing Life and Death, Enduring Hardships Together
    Jiyuan Militia and Civilians Bravely Escort the Wounded
    An Wei

    After our army recovered Xiangling City, the civilians of the Seventh District of Jiyuan and a group of militiamen from the Du Ba Lian bravely escorted the wounded towards the rear hospital.

    More than two hundred of Yan's die-hard troops, like rats, were lurking in Jiahan Village. When the stretchers entered the deep valley of the village, the die-hard troops frantically fired machine guns at the civilians. The militiamen from Du Ba immediately lay down and resisted on the spot, using machine guns and rifles to return fire. The civilians quickly carried the wounded to a concealed area. Some of the wounded anxiously shouted, "Comrades, put me down, you should escape! Don't let me involve you in losing your lives." The civilians replied, "Comrades! What are you talking about? As long as we don't die, we will never abandon you!" Nie Huaishu, a liberated farmer from Jianbei Village, was carrying a seriously wounded soldier on his back, with two slightly injured comrades holding his shoulders. In the emergency, he took out a grenade from his waist and bravely broke through the encirclement with the wounded soldier. When the wounded soldiers asked Nie to escape first, he firmly said, "Regardless of life or death, we must be together."

    The timid die-hard troops, upon hearing the machine gun fire, fled in panic, and we delivered the wounded to their destination without any casualties. When the militiamen and civilians left the wounded, the wounded said gratefully, "Comrades! You risked your lives to save us; we will never forget you!"

    同生死共患难
    济源民兵民夫英勇护送伤员
    安畏
    我军克复襄陵城后，济源七区的民夫和杜八联的一班民兵，英武地护送着伤员向着后方医院所在地迈进。
    阎顽军二百多个，象老鼠一样潜伏在贾罕村里。当担架进入该村的深谷时，顽军用机枪疯狂地向民夫射击着。杜八的民兵马上卧下就地抵抗，用机枪和步枪向敌还击。民夫们迅速抬着伤员，向隐蔽地带跑去。有的伤员们紧张地喊着：“同志，把我放下，你们逃走吧！不要因为我连累你们的生命。”民夫们却回答着：“同志！你说的是那里话，只要我们不死，绝不把你扔掉！”涧北村翻身农民聂怀书，这时背一个重伤员，还有两个轻彩号按住他的双肩。紧急中他从腰中取出手榴弹，带着伤员奋勇突围，当伤员们要求聂先脱险时，他坚决地说：“不管生死，咱们都要在一起”。
    胆怯的顽军，一听到机枪还击，便仓惶逃窜，我毫无伤亡地把伤员送到目的地。当民兵民夫离开伤员的时候，伤员们感激地说着：“同志！你们舍生救活了我们，我们永远忘不了你们！”
