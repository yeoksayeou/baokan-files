　　Eliminate Uncultivated Land, Increase Grain Production!
    According to the Taihang Second Administrative Office's work communication, the spring plowing inspection summary states: "Because at the beginning of this year's spring plowing, the leadership only had a conceptual understanding of the lack of labor and did not calculate it precisely, the call to eliminate uncultivated land was not affirmative and forceful enough; some places neglected to organize auxiliary labor to participate in agricultural production; in addition, some peasants became complacent after turning over, looking down on bad land, or the masses thought that planting remote, bad land was not worthwhile, that cultivating land was not as profitable as transportation, and some masses still had concerns about becoming rich through production, so uncultivated land generally increased." It continued: "…We must eliminate uncultivated land, expand cultivated land area, and increase grain production: First, we must make it clear that after realizing 'land to the tiller,' the labor intensity has increased unprecedentedly. If we can pay attention to organizing auxiliary labor to further consolidate and improve mutual aid teams, there will still be enough labor. We must not be continuously confused by the concept of labor shortage and relax the elimination of uncultivated land. Second, among cadres and heroes, we must establish a clear and affirmative ideology of increasing grain production. We must educate the masses that with good land and nearby land, we must not forget bad land and remote land. Producing one more dou of grain is increasing our strength to defeat Chiang Kai-shek by one point. Land is a gold-scraping board, and grain is the lifeline. Third, for remote and bad land with high costs, we should provide appropriate care in terms of burden, reducing the required output or deducting more consumption. Fourth, during the rush planting and replanting, we should pay attention to assigning fewer or exempting corvée. …" We believe that this issue is very important and the time is very pressing. Currently, all regions have successively received rain (although some places are not yet thorough). Rush planting and replanting cannot be delayed any longer. A slight oversight will definitely cause a great loss in grain income. We believe that the situation of uncultivated land is not only in the Taihang Second Administrative Region, but other regions should also conduct good inspections; not only in the mountains, but the plains should also pay attention; not only in the inland, but the border areas need to work harder (such as in the villages of the Qianfeng section of Anyang, uncultivated land accounts for an average of more than one-tenth). Therefore, we suggest that all regions conduct a major inspection, solving problems as they are discovered and quickly replanting. We hope that this suggestion will attract the attention of all regions and that they will reflect and transmit experiences at any time. (Border Region Government Central Work Office)

　　消灭熟荒增产食粮！
    据太行二专署工作通讯所载春耕检查总结中称：“由于今年春耕一开始，领导上对缺乏劳力是概念了解，没有精确计算，故对消灭熟荒提的不够肯定有力；有的地方对组织辅助劳力参加农业生产忽视；加上农民翻身后，有的自满，看不起坏地，或群众中认为种远地坏地不上算，耕地不如运输利润大，以及某些群众在生产发家上还有顾虑等，因此荒地普遍增加”。继称：“……………我们必须消灭熟荒，扩大耕地面积，增产粮食：第一、要明确实现耕者有其田后，劳动强度空前提高，我们能注意组织辅助劳力进一步把互助组巩固提高，劳力还是够用，不能被劳力缺乏的概念继续迷惑，放松了对荒地的消灭。第二、在干部英雄中要树立明确肯定的增产粮食思想。教育群众有了好地近地，不要忘了坏地远地，多打一斗粮，就是增加打败蒋介石的一分力量。地是刮金板，粮食是命根。第三、对远地坏地成本大的地，在负担上适当照顾，减低应产量或多扣消耗。第四、在抢种补种中间，注意少派勤务或免派。……………”我们认为这个问题提的很重要，在时间上也很紧迫。目前各地都先后落雨（虽有的地方还不透），抢种补种，不能再拖延，稍有疏忽，定要造成粮食收入上的极大损失。我们认为荒地情况，不仅在太行二专区，其他专区也应很好检查；不仅在山上，平原亦应注意；不仅在内地，边沿区更需努力（如安阳前锋段各村荒地平均占十分之一以上）。因此我们建议各地都来一个大检查，随发现随解决，赶紧补种。此建议，希能引起各地注意，并随时反映，传递经验。（边府中心工作办公室）
