　　Establish Poor Peasant Backbone, Thoroughly Investigate Landlords!
  　A Brief Account of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Re-examination Movement
    This Newspaper's Archives

    Since May, the masses in various counties of Hebei-Shandong-Henan have launched a vigorous land re-examination movement.

    The movement of more than two months has proven that poor peasants are the backbone of the re-examination movement. They are the earliest and most eager to demand the re-examination of landlords. In the movement, their actions are also the most resolute and thorough. In all levels of leadership, wherever there is conscious establishment of poor peasant organizations (poor peasant groups, poor peasant corps, poor peasant committees, poor peasant emancipation teams, etc.), and the core leadership of poor peasants is established in the farmers' association, and the middle peasants are united, the landlord class can be completely destroyed, and the policy of filling in the gaps and distributing the fruits can be implemented. This is a true class line that unites more than 90% of the masses and is the key to implementing land re-examination.

    Under the guidance of this clear class line, earth-shaking land re-examination movements have been rapidly launched in various counties of Hebei-Shandong-Henan. Poor peasant conferences of dozens of villages and thousands of people are being held universally in various counties. Taking Nanle as an example, all poor peasants with less than two mu of land in the county, regardless of old or young, male or female, participated in the poor peasant conference. At the meeting, the government explained in detail the policy of "completely eliminating landlords and realizing land to the tillers," and announced that all poor peasants participating in the conference were peasant representatives of each village. The Second and Third Districts of the county also held a grand authorization ceremony, in which the district instructor awarded the "Power" flag to the poor peasant representatives. After the poor peasant representatives received the flag on the stage, they raised the red flag with confidence and led the peasants back to the village to generally establish the Poor Peasant Emancipation Association (which is part of the farmers' association and is a poor peasant group in the farmers' association) or the Poor Peasant Emancipation Committee. The re-examination movement takes this association as the leading backbone. All issues must first be based on the opinions of the poor peasants, and the leadership boldly supports the poor peasants. After the opinions of the poor peasants are unified, they are united through various methods, calling on all the villagers to meet, and presenting the opinions of the poor peasants to the conference for discussion, striving for the sympathy of the middle peasants to follow the poor peasants, and establishing a joint struggle organization. In this way, with the poor peasants as the backbone, they can lead the broad masses to actively struggle against the landlords. Poor peasants also adopted a grand alliance between villages, breaking the boundaries. The momentum of the peasant class has grown, and the poor peasants have shown full heroic spirit in the struggle. They said: "I have the power, I can fight whoever I want to fight. I am the commander-in-chief of the village, and I am in charge of everything." They can completely break with the landlords, so they can completely eliminate the landlords in the village. When distributing the fruits, the poor peasant emancipation committee can smoothly approve whatever the poor peasants lack or exchange. In terms of economy, the principle of fair and reasonable filling in the gaps has been truly realized. After each struggle, poor peasant heroes are elected. At a celebration meeting of 100,000 emancipated peasants in the county, the poor peasants were praised by the Communist Party, and the leadership position of the poor peasants in the village became more consolidated. Now each village in Nanle has a Poor Peasant Emancipation Association, and the poor peasants have taken the dominant position in various departments. Now the masses in the county have universally shouted the slogan "Ask the poor peasants whether it is right or not."

    The establishment of this kind of poor peasant leadership immediately opened up a new situation in the land reform re-examination movement in various places. For example, the re-examination movement in Liyang Village in the First District of Nanle was led by 75 poor peasants, and the re-examination movement in Da Hanzhuang in the Second District was led by 47 poor peasants. In Xishao Guo in the Fourth District, the situation could not be opened for a long time. As a result, the emancipation hero Wu Xishui united more than 20 poor peasants to open the whole village situation. The scale of this movement is more in-depth and grand than the great development stage. According to incomplete statistics from seven counties in the Eighth District, Qingfeng, Qingxi, Nanle, Neihuang, Puyang, Nanfeng, and Guancheng, the fruits that the masses pursued from the landlords in the re-examination movement exceeded three to eighteen times that of the great development stage.

    The movement of more than two months has proven that to better implement this poor peasant line, it is necessary to:

    First, the party branch must fully support the poor peasants, establish the leadership of the poor peasant backbone, unite the middle peasants, and deal with the landlords. At the branch cadre conference in the Second District of Guancheng, they deeply reflected and examined the reasons why the land reform could not be deepened in the past. The reason was that the class ideology in the party was not clear, and the leading backbone of the poor peasants was not established among the masses, which made the struggle against the landlords weak and powerless. Then, under the class ideological education of "completely eliminating the landlords" and "serving the poor peasants," they overcame various different opinions in the party, unified the firm idea of establishing the leadership of the poor peasants in the party, and laid the ideological leadership foundation for the great re-examination movement. After these party cadres returned to the village, they immediately convened a village branch conference, reviewed the party members' ideology since the land reform in each village, and conducted in-depth education on relying on poor peasants as the backbone. When discussing the re-examination of the whole village, each village branch first consulted with the poor peasants, listened to their opinions, formulated a re-examination plan, and obtained the approval of the middle peasants. In the movement, the branch always fully supported the poor peasant group, making it the backbone of the leadership of the re-examination movement. After the poor peasant group was supported by the party, it was more confident, dared to act, and the party relied on it to smoothly lead the "backward," unite the middle peasants, organize a strong force, and unswervingly fight against the landlords, opening up the conciliatory situation of peaceful coexistence in the district for one or two years. This is the glorious victory of the Second District of Guancheng in the great re-examination under the branch's full support of the poor peasant leadership line.

    Second, it is necessary to overcome the rich peasant leadership ideology among the cadres in order to establish the backbone leadership of the poor peasants. This rich peasant leadership ideology is manifested in the fact that some village cadres with middle peasant status do not recognize the leading role of the poor peasants. Instead of relying on the poor peasants to unite the middle peasants, they rely on the middle peasants to lead the poor peasants, so they cannot give play to the enthusiasm of the poor peasants. In the movement, they often show ideas such as "not ruthless," "almost," and "no future." The land re-examination cannot be thoroughly implemented. Tie Lu Village in the Fourth District of Qingfeng is an example. Among the eleven village cadres in Tie Lu Village, six were middle peasants. After the land reform, the poor peasants in the village complained: The things left by the four local despotic landlords are more than the possessions of dozens of us! The cadres said: There are not many landlords in our village, and there are not many poor people either. There is nothing to do! Among the four branch committee members in Wang Xishao Village in Nanle, only one was a poor peasant, and the middle peasants accounted for five of the other eleven cadres in the organization. Adding up with the branch committee members, the middle peasants still accounted for the majority. Under this kind of leadership, the eight landlord households in the village, whose population accounted for only 19.5% of the total population of the village, still retained 19.68 mu of land after the land reform, which accounted for the total land of the village. The 33 poor peasant households, whose population accounted for 48% of the village, obtained land accounting for 44%. This number shows that although the poor peasants obtained part of the land, they were ultimately not as much as the land left to the landlords, and the land left to the landlords was generally better than that obtained by the poor peasants. Therefore, the peasants who did not completely turn over said: I didn’t have land before and now I have land, it’s like ascending from earth to heaven. If I compare with others (landlords), I’m still suspended in mid-air! Later, the leadership went deep into the masses and brought the reflections of the poor peasants to the party members and cadres for discussion and reflection. Everyone deeply felt that: There are many cadres from middle peasant backgrounds, they have not personally experienced the pain of the poor peasants, they lack the spirit of sincerely serving the poor peasants, and in some places they have even lost their position. After reflection, everyone unanimously proposed again: In the future, the opinions of the poor peasants must be the main thing, and they must do whatever the poor peasants ask them to do, resolutely serve the poor peasants, and let go of power, establish poor peasant groups, establish poor peasant leadership, and establish a re-examination committee with the poor peasants as the main force, unite the middle peasants, and re-launch the vigorous struggle to investigate the landlords and finally eliminate the landlords who were caught in the village. The old village cadres and old activists who were not active and thorough in the struggle and could not quickly correct themselves were temporarily drawn out for training. While clearing their minds, it was conducive to the emergence of poor peasant activists. Under the influence of clearing their minds and the new movement, the old village cadres and activists will actively support the movement led by the poor peasants. Such cadres can still return to the village and combine with the poor peasants to lead the struggle against the landlords.

    Third, to establish the backbone of poor peasants, it is necessary to overcome the thought of "fearing the division of the middle peasants" and not daring to let go of the poor peasants. The facts of Tan Village in the Fifth District of Nanfeng prove that after the backbone of the poor peasants was established, not only was the re-examination the most thorough and did not cause the division of the middle and poor peasants, but also in the further movement to investigate the landlords, the opinions of the middle peasant groups have shown that they are following the poor peasants. Every village cadre first seeks the opinions of the poor peasants when something happens, showing the close unity of the middle and poor peasants. For example, before the backbone of the poor peasants was established in Tan Village, the village leadership was in the hands of the middle peasants (the instructor and the head of the farmers' association were both middle peasants). The fruits were distributed according to the rich peasant line, the poor people were not completely turned over, and the landlords were not completely eliminated. After the village was re-examined in June, according to the requirements of the poor peasants in the village, four poor peasant groups were established, and the re-examination committee was reorganized before the re-examination was carried out thoroughly. During the re-examination, under the backbone leadership of the poor peasants, the whole village carried out the solidarity education of "the middle and poor peasants are one family." The middle peasants were completely absorbed into the movement, and the middle peasants had their own position in the movement. When detaining the four landlords who were caught in the village and directly confronting the landlords, the poor peasants were the most brave and resolute, which played the most practical role in educating and affirming the middle peasants, arousing the unanimous praise of the middle peasants. In the distribution of the fruits, the struggle and education of the two lines were carried out, and the policy of filling in the gaps and distributing what was lacking was established. All the fruits were first distributed to the poor peasants, and the middle peasants could also get a part of the fruits, so the middle peasants were also very happy about this.

    The Hebei-Shandong-Henan land reform re-examination movement has been rapidly launched with the clear establishment of the backbone of the poor peasants. Many of the most backward villages have also become advanced villages under the guidance of this line. The movement is now gradually deepening in the whole region.

　　树立贫农骨干，彻底追查地主！
  　冀鲁豫复查运动简记
    本报资料室
    五月以来，冀鲁豫各县群众展开了轰轰烈烈的土地复查运动。
    两个多月的运动证明：贫农是复查运动中的骨干。他们对复查地主要求最早而迫切，在运动中，他们的行动也表现得最为坚决和彻底，各级领导上，凡是有意识建立起贫农组织（贫农小组、贫农团、贫农委员会，贫农翻身队等）在农会中树立起贫农的核心领导并联合中农的地区，就能彻底摧毁地主阶级，就能贯彻填平补齐分配果实的政策，这是一条真正的团结百分之九十以上群众的阶级路线，是贯彻土地复查的决定关键。
    冀鲁豫各县，在这条明确的阶级路线指导下，翻天覆地的土地复查运动，就迅速开展起来了。几十个村，几千人的贫农大会，各县都在普遍举行。就以南乐来说罢，全县二亩以下的贫农，不管老的少的，男的女的，都参加了贫农大会。会上政府详细解释了“彻底消灭地主，实现耕者有其田”的政策，并宣布所有参加大会的贫农，都是各村的农民代表。该县二、三区还举行了隆重的授权仪式，由区指导员授予“权”字红旗给贫农代表，贫农代表上台受旗后，即高举红旗，信心十足的率领农民回村，普遍成立贫农翻身会（它是农会的一部分，是农会中的贫农小组）或贫农翻身委员会，复查运动即以该会为领导骨干，一切问题，均须首先以贫农的意见为准绳，领导上则大胆给贫农撑腰，贫农意见统一起来后，即通过各种方式联合起来，召集全村农民开会，把贫农意见交给大会讨论，争取中农同情，跟着贫农走，并建立联合斗争组织，这样以贫农为骨干，即可带领广大群众，积极向地主进行斗争。村与村间，贫农也采取了大联合，打破了界限，农民阶级的声势壮大，贫农在斗争中，都表现了十足的英雄气概，他们说：“我有权了，我想斗谁就斗谁，我是村里的总司令，一切事情由我管”，他们能与地主彻底撕破情面，因此能将村里地主彻底消灭干净。到分果实时，贫农少什么东西，贫农换什么东西，贫农翻身委员会都很顺利的给予通过，在经济上，真正实现了公平合理的填平补齐的原则，每次斗争之后，跟着就选举了贫农英雄，在该县一次十万翻身农民庆祝大会上，贫农们又受到共产党的表扬，贫农在村里的领导地位，更加巩固起来了，现南乐各村都有贫农翻身会，贫农在各部门组织中，已占了优势。现全县群众已普遍喊出了“中不中问贫农”的口号。
    这种贫农领导地位的确立，立刻使各地的土改复查运动轰开了新的局面、如南乐一区的李扬村复查运动，就是由七十五个贫农领导搞起来的，二区的大韩庄是由四十七个贫农领导的，四区的西邵郭，长期打不开局面，结果由翻身英雄吴西水团结了二十多个贫农打开了全村局面。这种运动的规模，也比大发展阶段时，更为深入宏大，根据八分区清丰、清西、南乐、内黄、濮县、南峰、观城七县不完全的统计，复查运动中群众追出地主果实，较之大发展阶段所得者超过三倍至十八倍。
    两个多月的运动证明：要很好贯彻这条贫农路线，必须：
    第一、党员支部必须全力支持贫农，树立贫农骨干领导，联合中农，对付地主。观城二区在布置复查支干大会上，深入反省检查了过去土改不能深入的原因，是党内阶级思想不明确，没有在群众中，把贫农领导骨干树立起来，致使对地主的斗争软弱无力。接着他们在“彻底消灭地主”“为贫苦农民服务”的阶级思想教育下，克服了党内各种不同意见，统一了党内树立贫农领导的坚定思想，打下了大复查运动的思想领导基础。这些党员干部回村后，即召开村支部大会，检查了各村土改以来的党员思想，进行了依靠贫农作骨干的深入教育，各村支部在讨论全村复查时，即首先去与贫农商量，听取他们的意见，制订复查计划，并取得中农的赞成。而在运动中，支部自始至终都全力支持着贫农小组使它成为复查运动领导中的中坚，贫农小组得到党的支持后，更信心百倍，敢作敢为，党依靠着它顺利的带起了“落后”，联合起中农，组织了强大的力量，坚定不移的同地主斗争，打开了一二年来该区和平共居的调和性局面，这就是观城二区在大复查中，支部全力支持贫农领导路线下的光辉胜利。
    第二、必须克服干部中的富农领导思想，才能很好树立贫农的骨干领导。这种富农领导思想，表现在有些中农成份的村干部，不认识贫农的领导作用。他们不是依靠贫农去联合中农，而是依靠中农去领导贫农，因而不能发挥贫农的积极性，在运动中就常常表现出不“狠”“差不多”“没搞头”等思想，土地复查就不能彻底贯彻下去，清丰四区的铁炉庄就是一个例子。铁炉庄全村十一个村干，中农就占了六位，土地改革之后，村里贫农诉苦说：四家恶霸地主留的东西，比俺几十家还多呢？而干部则说：我村地主不多，穷人也不多，没啥搞头！南乐王西邵村四个支部委员中，只有一个是贫农，其他组织十一个干部中，中农占了五个，与支部委员加起来中农仍占优势，在这种领导下，全村八户地主，人口只占全村人口总数百分之十九·五，土改后却仍留有土地占全村土地总数十九·六八亩，而贫农三三户，人口占全村百分之四十八，所得土地，却占百分之四十四，这个数字说明贫农虽然获得了部分土地，但终不如给地主所留土地之多，而地主所留土地，一般又比贫农所得者为好，因此未翻透身的农民说：从前没地现在有了地，好似地上升天上啦，要是同人家比比（地主）咱还在半空中悬着哩！以后领导上深入群众，把贫苦农民的反映，提到党员干部中讨论反省，大家才痛切的感到：干部中农出身多，没有亲身体会到贫农的痛苦，缺乏真心为贫苦农民服务的精神，有些地方还失掉立场。经过反省后，大家才又一致提出：今后必须以贫农的意见为主，贫农叫干啥就干啥，坚决为贫苦农民服务，并放手交权，成立贫农小组，树立贫农领导，以贫农为主成立复查委员会，联合中农，重新又开展了轰轰烈烈追查地主的斗争最后消灭了村里落网的地主。对那些斗争不积极不彻底，又不能很快改正过来的老村干，老积极分子，则暂时抽出训练，一面打通思想，一面顺利于贫农积极分子的涌现，在打通思想及新的运动影响之下，老村干积极分子，是会积极起来，支持贫农领导的运动，这样的干部，仍可回村与贫农结合起来，一齐领导向地主斗争。
    第三、树立贫农骨干必须克服“怕中农分裂”不敢放手给贫农的思想。南峰五区谭庄村的事实证明：贫农骨干树立后，不但复查搞得最彻底，没有引起中贫农的分裂，而且在进一步追查地主的运动中，已表现出中农组的意见，在跟着贫农走，每个村干有事都去先征求贫农的意见，显示出中贫农的亲密团结。比如：谭村在未树立贫农骨干以前，村领导掌握在中农手里（指导员农会长都是中农），果实采取富农路线的分配方法，穷人并未彻底翻身，地主并未彻底消灭，六月该村复查后，根据全村贫农的要求，成立了四个贫农小组，重新组织了复查委员会，才彻底的进行了复查，复查中在贫农的骨干领导下，全村进行了“中贫农一家”的团结教育，中农完全被吸收参加了运动，中农在运动中拥有自己的地位，而在扣押全村四家落网地主与地主直接交锋时，贫农又表现得最勇敢最坚决，对中农起了最实际的教育与坚定作用，引起了中农的一致赞扬。在分果实中，又进行了两条路线的斗争和教育，确立了填平补齐，少啥分啥的方针，一切果实的分配都先分给贫民，中农同样可分到一部分果实，因此中农也很高兴这样。
    冀鲁豫的土改复查运动，就在明确树立贫农的骨干迅速展开起来了，许多最落后的村庄，也在这条路线的指引下，成为先进村。现全区运动正逐步深入中。
