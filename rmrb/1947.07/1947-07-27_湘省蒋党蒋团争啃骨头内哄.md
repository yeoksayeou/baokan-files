Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 23rd: Changsha dispatch: In Hunan Province, the Chiang Party (Kuomintang) and Chiang Youth League are fighting over scraps, displaying an ugly spectacle. Gao Yihan, Chiang Kai-shek's inspector for Hunan and Hubei, recently summarized this, saying: "The worst impression Hunan has given me is that the struggle between the 'Party' (Kuomintang) and the 'League' (Three People's Principles Youth League) has reached the point of hand-to-hand combat." It is said that in Dayong County, the so-called "County Council" is the center of the "Party" and "League" struggle. The "Speaker," Xiong Wugong, is a figure from the "League" side, while the "Deputy Speaker," Qu Dingyi, is a figure from the "Party" side. When the "Speaker" wants to hold a meeting, the "Party" side does not attend; when the "Deputy Speaker" wants to hold a meeting, the "League" side does not attend. Therefore, meetings often fail to materialize. Even when meetings do take place, the two sides put up slogans and hurl abuse at each other face-to-face. When the county government was reorganized this April, the three newly appointed section chiefs of civil affairs, finance, and military affairs were all close to the "Party" side, and the "League" side immediately spoke out in attack. When the new police chief took office, the old chief refused to hand over power and took more than 20 guns into the mountains to become a bandit. The new police station thus became a battleground for the "Party" and "League." Of the two police squads under its jurisdiction, the Tian squad belonged to the "Party," and the Zhao squad belonged to the "League." On May 7th, a brawl broke out in front of the police station, resulting in one death in the Tian squad and two guns being seized. Two people died in the Zhao squad, and an innocent resident nearby also died. In Jing County, during the Chiang Party's "Youth Day" (March 29th) performance this year, a major fight broke out. Gunshots rang out, and a stagehand was shot and killed. The behind-the-scenes figures in the brawl were, on one side, the "Party's" principal of the provincial No. 8 Middle School, and on the other side, the "League's" secretary-general. During last year's "election" of the Chiang Kai-shek's provincial council in Hunan, intense "Party-League struggles" were staged in various counties. The most exciting was during the election of the Liuyang Women's Association, where the wife of the "Party's" "secretary-general" and the wife of the "League's" "secretary-general" actually fought each other until they were bleeding from the head.

　　湘省蒋党蒋团争啃骨头内哄
    【新华社华中二十三日电】长沙讯：湘省蒋党蒋团争啃骨头，丑态百出。蒋记两湖监察使高一涵最近对此总结谓：“湖南给我最坏的印象，是‘党’（国民党）‘团’（三青团）斗争已到短兵相接的时候了。”据称：在大庸县，所谓“县参议会”是“党”“团”斗争的中心。“正议长”熊悟工为“团”方人物，“副议长”屈定义是“党”方人物。“正议长”要开会“党”方不出席，“副议长”要开会“团”方不出席。因此会议时常流产，即使开会双方亦大贴标语当面谩骂。今年四月县府改组，新委的民、财、军三个科长均接近“党”方，团方即发言攻击。新警察局长上任时旧局长不移交，并携枪二十余支入山为匪。新警察局遂成为“党”“团”逐鹿之所，所属两警察队，田队属“党”，赵队属“团”，五月七日在警局面前发生械斗，结果田队死一人，被缴枪二支，赵队死二人，附近居民枉死一人。靖县在今年蒋党“青年节”（三月二十九日）演戏时大打出手，枪声响处，一个布景员中弹毙命，械斗的幕后人物，一方是“党”的省立八中校长，另一方是“团”的干事长。去年湘省蒋记参议会“选举”时，各县都演出激烈的“党团之争”，最精彩的是浏阳妇女会选举时，“党”的“书记长”老婆，和“团”的“干事长”老婆，竟互殴至头破血流。
