Jiao County and Gaomi were briefly occupied on the 5th and 8th, respectively, but were recovered on the 11th and 9th. The enemy's entire 54th Army was forced to flee east across the Gu River from Jiaocheng. Currently, there are no enemy traces in the Jiao County, Gaomi section, and within 20 li east of Jiaocheng.
