　　Hebei-Shandong-Henan Local Armed Forces
  　Wipe Out Over 1,000 Chiang Troops
  　Border Defense in Yan-Jun Area Repeatedly Defeats Enemies Looting Grain
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Hebei-Shandong-Henan on the 2nd] (Delayed) A part of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan local armed forces, on the 23rd of last month, at Goose and Duck Factory northeast of Liangshan (about 40 li northeast of Yuncheng), annihilated the entire First and Third Battalions, 87th Regiment, 29th Brigade, 55th Division of the Chiang army, totaling over 1,000 men, killing and wounding over 300 enemies, capturing over 800, and seizing a large amount of supplies.
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Hebei-Shandong-Henan on the 1st] Our joint defense militia, work teams, and local armed forces in the border area of Yan (Jin) and Jun (County) have repeatedly thwarted the enemy's grain-grabbing plans. On June 6th, a part of the Chiang army's 66th Division, towards the Xinzhen area of the Daoqing Highway, covering the puppet town government's grain looting, our local corps immediately went upon hearing the news. The enemy was eating and drinking in the township office when they were surrounded by us. None of the enemy escaped, and all laid down their weapons. Eighteen were captured, and eight long and short guns were seized. On the same day, Comrade Hou Haichun, the militia captain of the Sixth District of Yanjin, led two militiamen in an ambush at Hu'an Village, north of the Daoqing Road. When the grain-grabbing enemy entered the village, they first fired a burst of shots into the village. Our militiamen calmly concealed themselves and waited for the enemy to enter our ambush circle. With a burst of battle cries, they rushed towards the enemy. The enemy turned and fled, resulting in one being captured alive by us, and two hand grenades seized. On June 7th, the armed forces of the puppet county government twice went to Guanzhuang area of our Sixth District to grab grain. The first time, the enemy reached outside the village and heard the sound of our gunfire executing the bad guys, and they were so frightened that they fled back. The second time, the puppet troops combined with a part of the enemy's 46th Division and invaded the village again, attempting to grab grain. Before entering the village, they bombarded fiercely with artillery fire. Due to the calm response of our work team and the persistence of the position, the enemy was finally driven back, thwarting the enemy's two grain-grabbing plans. On the afternoon of June 10th, more than 200 puppet county government personnel, carrying three machine guns, went to the Guancun area on the edge of our Fourth District to grab grain. Our district unit commander led 18 militiamen in an ambush. When they were more than 100 meters away from the enemy, our machine guns and rifles fired together, resulting in the death of two enemies and the wounding of six. We suffered no casualties. On the afternoon of the 9th, more than 30 puppet Jun County government personnel went to the front and rear Yucun of our Sixth District to grab wheat, coming into contact with a platoon of our militia and a part of a certain regiment of the sub-district. After an hour of fighting, one enemy was killed, one rifle and 150 rounds of ammunition were seized, and the enemy fled south. On the same afternoon, the puppet county government, in coordination with the troops of the traitor Niu Yingde and others, totaling more than 60 people, went to Duozhuang to grab grain. A certain unit of our sub-district engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy for several hours. The enemy suffered five casualties, while we suffered no losses. On the 4th, a part of our local armed forces went to the Jixianji area of the Sixth District to wipe out the puppet bandits, capturing more than 20 enemies, including Zhang Mingkai, the head of the enemy communication station, and Xu Jinghai of the "Homecoming Corps."
