Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 1st. The masses in Zishi (new county) County, on the northern side of the Hai’an-Taizhou line in Suzhong, are carrying out self-defense movements such as "landmines," "bridge demolition," and "Wu Zang" (Wu being a local term, meaning to hide), thwarting many "sweeping operations" by Chiang's troops. The county and townships have established "wartime command liaison stations" for unified command. Villages have established explosive sniper teams, laying layers of landmines on the enemy's routes, combined with rifle sniping. In mid-May alone, on the first day of Chiang's troops' "sweeping operation," more than 30 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded by landmines. Shocked, the enemy used bricks and tiles to probe for landmines, advancing at a snail's pace. The less than ten miles from Hongqiao to Mojiazhuang took them a full six hours. Wherever the enemy went, the masses cleverly used the water network terrain, acting under the slogan of "dismantling one bridge is equivalent to one machine gun," dismantling bridges wherever the enemy went. On one occasion, the enemy tried to rendezvous at Mojiazhuang from the east and west. The eastern route enemy faced a large river, unable to advance, while the western route enemy, suspecting they were surrounded by us, rushed to reinforce, resulting in a chaotic battle across the river with heavy casualties. In terms of emptying the villages and fields, the principle was "not to meet the enemy," with organized evacuations, and carrying out the "five Wu" movement of hiding pots, hiding grain, hiding boats, hiding fences, and hiding paddles, making it difficult for the enemy to gain a foothold wherever they went. When the enemy launched an all-out attack using "empty village tactics," the militia and masses in the enemy's heartland launched "heart-digging tactics" to capture the few Chiang's puppet soldiers, leaving the enemy unable to attend to both ends. Due to this vigorous mass self-defense movement, powerfully combined with the guerrilla warfare of the local military units, although the enemy has launched five large-scale "sweeping operations" of over a thousand men since this spring, each time they lasted for no more than a few days before scurrying back to the Hai’an-Taizhou line in disgrace.

### 苏中紫石县　开展地雷水网运动　蒋军到处难以立足

  　开展地雷水网运动　蒋军到处难以立足
    【新华社华中一日电】苏中海（安）泰（州）线北侧紫石（新县）县群众开展“地雷”、“抽桥”、“五＠”（＠土语、藏之意）等自卫运动，粉碎蒋军多次“扫荡”。该县乡设“战时指挥联络站”，统一指挥。村设爆炸狙击组，在敌来路上层层设雷，并结合步枪狙击。仅五月中旬，蒋军“扫荡”第一天，即炸死炸伤敌三十余人。敌震惊之下，以砖瓦泥块探索地雷，龟步行进，从虹桥至莫家庄不满十里，整整跑了六个钟点。敌所到之处，群众即机智地利用水网地形，在“多抽一顶桥抵到一挺机关枪”的口号下，敌人到那里，桥就抽到那里。一次，敌东西约会莫家庄，东路敌面隔大河，无法前进，西路敌疑其被我包围，赶来增援，双方隔河混战，伤亡甚大。在空舍清野方面，提出“不与敌人见面”，有组织的转移，并展开＠锅、＠粮、＠船、＠篱、＠拍等五＠运动，使敌每到一地，难以立足。当敌以“空心战术”倾巢出犯时，在敌心脏地区之民兵群众，则提出“挖心战术”捕捉少数蒋伪，使敌首尾不顾。由于此种轰轰烈烈的群众自卫运动，并有力结合地方兵团之游击战，敌从今春以来虽曾发动千人以上的五次大“扫荡”，但每次进行不到数天，即狼狈窜回海泰线。
