Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: TASS, New York, 27th: The Security Council has begun discussing the issue of apportionment of the world security force as outlined in the Military Staff Committee report. The Soviet Union suggests that all permanent members should be apportioned equally. The United States, Britain, and other countries advocate for a "relatively equal apportionment," which may grant a special status to a powerful and influential member. In any case, the Soviet Union cannot accept this view, because this is not merely a technical issue, but also a political one. If this point cannot be agreed upon, it is difficult to imagine what progress the Security Council's discussion on the security force issue can make.

　　安理会讨论世界警卫军问题
  　苏坚持常任理事国平等摊派
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】塔斯社二十七日纽约讯：安理会已开始讨论军事参谋委员会报告中关于世界警卫军之摊派额问题。苏联建议一切常任理事国应被平等摊派。美、英等国则主张采取“比较平等的摊派”，可能使某一强大而有力的会员获得特殊地位。无论如何，苏联不能接受此种意见。因为这不仅是技术问题，而且是政治问题。如果此点不能获得协议，则很难想象安理会对于警卫军问题的讨论会有什么发展。
