　　Random Jottings About Chiang’s Troops
　　One, Airlift
　　According to Pan Jiaxiang, a soldier who deserted from the 117th Regiment of the 39th Brigade of Chiang's 40th Division: The stubborn puppets besieged in Anyang recently are terrified of being annihilated by the People's Liberation Army and are in a state of extreme panic. Fearing that all their materials and equipment would become spoils of war for the People's Liberation Army, they are using several planes every day for an airlift. Besides materials and equipment, the wives of the stubborn puppet officials are also considered airlift items. However, not every wife can enjoy the right to be airlifted; only the wives of battalion commanders and above are qualified to fly. A company commander's wife needs connections and favors to get a seat on the plane. As for the wives of platoon leaders, they are simply not qualified. Unable to leave through the underground for fear of the Eighth Route Army (actually, they don't understand the Eighth Route Army), more than two hundred platoon-level wives have no choice but to "sigh at the sight of the plane!"
　　Two, Plane Crash
　　Also according to Pan Jiaxiang: A few days ago, a plane burned in Anyang. The story is like this:
　　A plane with two pilots, carrying four high-ranking officials' wives, and some ammunition, took off from Anyang heading south. It had barely circled once after taking off from the airport when the plane caught fire. The pilots quickly landed, and as soon as they and the wives jumped out of the plane, the ammunition inside exploded. In an instant, smoke filled the air and shell casings flew everywhere. The pilots and wives quickly lay flat on the ground. After the brief scare, the plane was completely burned. One of the wives, the manager of the Anyang Yarn Factory, carried more than a catty of gold and over ten million yuan in legal tender. The gold, impervious to fire, was fortunately not lost, but the legal tender was completely reduced to ashes. These wives, scorched and terrified, were not only traumatized but, upon returning to the city, were also detained, accused of "colluding with the Eighth Route Army," otherwise, how could the plane have burned? Since then, the wives of lower-ranking officers have had to find a guarantor before flying, to prevent accidents.
　　Three, Desertion
　　According to Wang Fuyi, a surrendered messenger from Chiang's 64th Division stationed at the Yellow River Bridge: The 64th Division is now using a rice bowl and a handful of beans at the entrance of the barracks, guarded by soldiers, to prevent desertion. Every time someone leaves, a bean is placed in the bowl. When they return, a bean is taken out of the bowl. At the end of the night, the number of beans left in the bowl indicates the number of people who haven't returned, so they can track down the missing individuals based on the beans.
　　Also, according to Long Zaidong, a recently captured soldier from the 32nd Division: The 32nd Division's new method to prevent desertion is to issue each soldier two hats: a wide-brimmed hat and an American-style cap. Usually, the wide-brimmed hat and the military uniform jacket are collected, and only issued during inspections, departures, etc. Normally, they are only allowed to wear shirts and American-style caps. Guards are instructed not to allow anyone to pass who is not wearing a wide-brimmed hat and military uniform jacket, even if they have supporting documents. Despite this, they still can't stop desertion. The more the officers try to prevent it, the more deserters there are.
　　Four, Garlic Pulling Team
　　When our army counterattacked on the Zhengtai Line, the enemy in Shijiazhuang panicked. The Kuomintang's 16th Army was hastily airlifted to Shijiazhuang. At the time, the Kuomintang boasted about the 16th Army as the "Iron Army" with American equipment... Before seeing them in person, they seemed like something special.
　　Only two battalions of the 16th Army arrived in Shijiazhuang, under the command of the 3rd Army. They were squeezed out and forced to guard the outskirts of Shijiazhuang. When the situation was tight north of the road, they were deployed north; when it was tight south of the road, they were deployed south. Our local armed forces and militia alone confused them so much they couldn't manage both sides. A company stationed at a stronghold in Dachexing had no food, only guns. They forced villagers to make pancakes and exchanged them for shoes from the people. Pulling garlic in the villagers' gardens became a common practice. Therefore, as soon as the 16th Army entered a village, the people would shout, "The pancake-making, shoe-swapping, garlic-pulling team is coming!" and everyone would hide.

### 蒋军二三事

　　蒋军二三事
  　一、空运
    据蒋军四十师三十九旅一一七团逃亡士兵潘家祥谈：最近困守安阳的顽伪，惟恐遭到人民解放军的歼灭内部恐慌万状。所有物资辎重恐怕作了解放军的战利品，于是每天用好几架飞机在空运。除了物资辎重而外，顽伪官员的太太也算空运物品之一。但这些太太也不是每个人都能享空运的权利，而是营长以上的太太才够坐飞机的资格，连长的太太必须连长有门子、能托人情才可以，至于排长太太就根本不够资格，地下走又怕八路军（实际上是不了解八路军），两百多排级的太太，只好“望机兴叹！”
    二、飞机失事
    又据潘家祥谈：前几天安阳烧了一架飞机，经过是这样的：
    一架飞机两个驾驶员载着四个大官太太，还有一些弹药，由安阳起飞南运，从机场起飞仅仅盘旋了一个圈子，飞机就着火了，于是赶紧降落，着地之后驾驶员与太太们刚刚从飞机上跳下来，里面的弹药就爆炸了。一时硝烟弥漫，弹壳纷飞，驾驶员与太太们赶忙伏倒在地。一场虚惊过了，飞机完全焚毁，其中有一个安阳纱厂经理的太太，携带金子一斤多，法币千余万元；金子不怕火烧，侥幸没有损失，法币完全化为灰烬了。这些太太们烧了个焦头烂额、饱受虚惊还不算，回到城里之后，又被扣押起来，说是她们“通八路”，不然飞机怎么会烧了？所以自此以后，凡是下级官的太太坐飞机必须觅具妥保，以防意外。
    三、逃亡
    据驻守黄河桥蒋军六十四师投诚传令兵王福义谈：六十四师现在为了防止逃亡，在营房的门口放有饭碗一个，豆子一把，由卫兵负责，出去一个人，把豆子放入碗里一颗。回来一个人，由碗里取出一颗豆子，最后到晚上，碗里剩几颗豆子，就是几个人没回来，好按照豆子，去追查人数。
    又据三十二师最近被俘士兵龙在东谈：三十二师防止逃亡的新办法是：他们每人两顶帽子，一顶是大沿帽，一顶是美式便帽；平时把大沿帽与军服上衣收回，遇到检阅、出发等时再发给。平常只准穿衬衣戴美式便帽。各岗哨遇有不戴大沿帽不穿军服上衣的，虽之持有证明文件也不准通行。虽然如此，仍然禁止不住逃亡。当官的越千方百计的防止，开小差的却有增无已。
    四、拔蒜队
    当我军在正太线反击时，石门敌人着慌了，国民党十六军由空运仓促的到了石门，当时国民党给十六军喧嚷的什么“铁军”来到，美式装备，……当没见到他真象时，似乎有啥介事似的。
    十六军到石门的只有两个营，受第三军指挥，被排挤的只有到石门外围来把口子。路北紧就调到路北，路南紧又调到路南，只我地方武装和民兵就把他弄的昏头症脑，来回顾不着。一个连驻到大车行据点，没粮食吃只有枪，到各村强迫烙饼，碰到老百姓就换鞋，到老百姓园里拔蒜，成为惯例。所以十六军一下乡，老百姓就喊：“烙饼换鞋拔蒜队来了”，群众就全都躲起来。
