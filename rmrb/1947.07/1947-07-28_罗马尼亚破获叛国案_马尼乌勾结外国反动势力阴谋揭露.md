　　Romania Uncovers Treason Case
　　Maniu's Conspiracy with Foreign Reactionary Forces Exposed
　　(Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th) Bucharest dispatch: The Romanian government uncovered a treason conspiracy on the 15th of this month and has arrested the principal offender, National Peasant Party Chairman Maniu, and sixteen other key criminals. In the preliminary interrogation, the conspiracy of Maniu and his followers to cross the border and collude with foreign reactionary forces to overthrow the Romanian democratic government has been completely exposed. According to the confession of Mihalake, one of the principal offenders arrested this time, Maniu had discussed this attempt with him as early as the beginning of last year and began preparing to cross the border at the end of March last year. He received Maniu's order on July 11th, planning to flee to Turkey by plane on the 14th. After Mihalake confessed the truth, Maniu also confessed that the purpose of his and his trusted followers going abroad was to "contact certain countries and create an atmosphere there conducive to overthrowing the current Romanian government." While the trial was in progress, the Romanian Lower House of Parliament revoked the parliamentary qualifications of National Peasant Party members Maniu and six others on the 19th.
