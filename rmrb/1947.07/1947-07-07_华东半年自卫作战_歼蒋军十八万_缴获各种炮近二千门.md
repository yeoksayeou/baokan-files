Xinhua News Agency, Eastern China Front, 4th: The headquarters of the Eastern China People's Liberation Army has recently released the following report on the progress and major achievements of the patriotic self-defense war in the first half of this year:

　　From January 2nd to 4th this year, the Eastern China People's Liberation Army annihilated the KMT's reorganized 26th Division (the 41st Brigade of this division had already been annihilated in the Subei Campaign last December) and the motorized 1st Rapid Column, known as the KMT's "Diamond," in the Bianzhuang and Lanling areas of southern Shandong. Immediately following the great victory at the beginning of the year, our army annihilated the KMT's reorganized 51st Division's 114th Brigade (minus one regiment) and one regiment of the reorganized 52nd Division in the battle to liberate the county on January 10th. In the battle to abandon Zaozhuang on January 19th, the final and complete annihilation of the KMT's reorganized 51st Division was accomplished. After suffering an unprecedented disastrous defeat in the southern Shandong campaign, the KMT adopted a strategy of "key offensives" on the Shandong battlefield. Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Cheng personally went to Xuzhou to directly command the loudly proclaimed "Shandong Campaign." At this time, Hao Pengju betrayed the people and took office as the commander-in-chief of the KMT's 42nd Army Group, participating in the anti-people civil war. Our army launched a punitive campaign on February 6th, annihilating his headquarters and the 2nd and 4th Divisions, and capturing the traitorous leader Hao Pengju alive. From February 20th to 23rd, our main force suddenly appeared in the Laiwu area, annihilating Li Xianzhou's Northern Route Army, including the entire 73rd Army, the reorganized 46th Division, and the New 36th Division (minus one regiment) of the 12th Army, totaling seven brigades (divisions). Simultaneously, our Jiaoji Railway Corps annihilated one regiment each of the KMT's 103rd Division and 166th Division of the 8th Army. Our army took advantage of the victory to expand its gains, recovering towns on both sides of the Jiaoji Railway. On February 28th, the enemy's 15th Traffic Police Brigade, guarding over a hundred li along the Jiaoji Eastern Section from Hama Tun to Caijiazhuang, was cleared, forcing the KMT troops on the Jiaoji Railway to be trapped in Jinan, Changyi (Le'an) County, and Qingdao. After the defeat at Laiwu, Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Cheng shifted the blame for the defeat to Xue Yue and Li Xianzhou, who was captured with his army annihilated and unable to defend himself. Gu Zhutong was stationed in Xuzhou, and Wang Jingjiu's army corps was transferred from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan battlefield, along with Tang Enbo's army corps and Ou Zhen's army corps, originally on the Shandong battlefield, gathering fifteen reorganized divisions in the front line, planning another invasion. Our army launched the Tai'an Campaign on April 12th, liberating Tai'an City on April 26th, annihilating the KMT's reorganized 72nd Division, and taking advantage of the victory to liberate Ningyang City and important locations such as Yancheng Xiaolipu. To coordinate with the Tai'an Campaign, our army simultaneously blocked the KMT's reorganized 11th, 25th, 74th, and 65th Divisions along the Mengshan Mountain's eastern foothills and the Jiunüguan line southwest of Mengyin, engaging in fierce battles for six days and nights, annihilating more than 6,000 KMT troops. From April 29th to May 1st, our army counterattacked the KMT's reorganized 83rd Division along the Qingtuosi, Duozhuang, and Jiepai line on the Lin (Yi) Meng (Yin) Road, annihilating one regiment each of its 63rd Brigade and 44th Brigade, as well as another reconnaissance battalion. By May 13th, our army counterattacked the KMT's elite main force, the reorganized 74th Division, in the Tanbu area, compressing it to Menglianggu. After fierce fighting, it was completely annihilated on the 16th. Simultaneously with the Menglianggu Campaign, our army blocked the enemy's reorganized 25th, 83rd, 65th, 7th, 48th, and 11th Divisions, as well as the 5th Army, inflicting over 6,000 casualties. After suffering this heavy blow, the KMT readjusted its deployments, attempting a risky gamble. As of June 28th, there had only been outpost contacts, without major battles.

　　From the beginning of the year to June 28th, in half a year, we annihilated a total of 184,079 KMT officers and soldiers, including 60,072 killed or wounded and 124,007 captured alive. Among them, 72,706 KMT regular troops were annihilated, including six reorganized divisions, totaling seventeen reorganized brigades, namely: the entire 44th Brigade and 169th Brigade of the reorganized 26th Division, the entire 113th Brigade and 114th Brigade of the reorganized 51st Division, the entire 175th Brigade, 188th Brigade, and New 19th Brigade of the reorganized 46th Division, the entire 15th Division, 77th Division, and 193rd Division of the 73rd Army, the entire New 13th Brigade and 34th Brigade of the reorganized 72nd Division, and most of the reorganized 15th Brigade; another nine reorganized regiments, namely: the New 36th Division of the 12th Army (minus one regiment), the 98th Regiment of the 33rd Brigade of the reorganized 52nd Division, the 57th Regiment of the 19th Brigade of the reorganized 83rd Division, the 1st Regiment of the 44th Brigade, one regiment of the 63rd Brigade, the 111th Regiment of the 37th Brigade of the reorganized 77th Division, and one regiment each of the 103rd Division and 166th Division of the 8th Army; another three reorganized battalions, namely: one reconnaissance battalion each from the reorganized 28th Division, the reorganized 11th Division, and the reorganized 83rd Division; another one complete regiment and four complete battalions of specialized troops, namely: the entire 5th Regiment of the Central Artillery Corps, and one battalion each of the 4th Regiment of the Central Artillery Corps, motor vehicle, tank, and engineer battalions.

　　Major KMT officers captured alive include: Li Xianzhou, Deputy Commander of the Second Appeasement District of the Xuzhou Appeasement Headquarters; Ma Liwu, Commander of the Reorganized 26th Division; Zhou Yuying, Commander of the Reorganized 51st Division; Han Jun, Commander of the 73rd Army; Yang Wen@, Commander of the Reorganized 72nd Division, and five other lieutenant generals; Han Shiru, Deputy Commander of the Reorganized 51st Division; Li Xianzong, Chief of Staff; Li Yutang, Brigade Commander; Li Mouyu, Deputy Brigade Commander; Li Buqing, Commander of the 114th Brigade; Wang Weilin, Chief of Staff of the Second Appeasement District; Tao Zhongwei, Director of the Intelligence Division; Li Yan, Deputy Commander of the 73rd Army; Zhou Jianqiu, Chief of Staff; Yang Ming, Commander of the 15th Division; Xu Yaxiong, Deputy Commander; Liu Lihua, Director of the Political Department; Xiao Chongguang, Commander of the 193rd Division; Bai Zhuchen, Deputy Commander; Yang Zanmo, Chief of Staff of the Reorganized 46th Division; Gan Chengcheng, Commander of the 175th Brigade; Chen Jiong, Deputy Commander; You Jingxiang, Director of the Political Department; Hai Jing, Commander of the 188th Brigade; Luo An, Deputy Commander; Chao Wei, Deputy Commander of the New 19th Brigade; Zhu Shunkun, Deputy Commander of the Reorganized 12th Division; Li Zejie, Commander of the 34th Brigade; Yang Bengu, Commander of the New 13th Brigade; Wei Zhenyue, Chief of Staff of the Reorganized 74th Division; Li Yunliang, Deputy Chief of Staff; Chen Chuanjun, Commander of the 51st Brigade; Pi Xuanyou, Deputy Commander; Chen Xuyun, Commander of the 57th Brigade, and twenty-nine other major generals.

    【新华社华东前线四日电】华东人民解放军总部顷发表本年上半年爱国自卫战争经过及主要战绩如下：
    华东人民解放军于今年一月二日至四日，在鲁南卞庄、兰陵地区，歼灭蒋军整二十六师（该师四十一旅已于去年十二月在宿北战役就歼）及号称蒋军“金钢钻”之摩托化第一快速纵队。紧接岁首大捷，我军于一月十日解放县之役，歼灭蒋军整五一师一一四旅（缺一个团），及整五二师之一个团。于十九日放弃枣庄之役，完成对蒋整五一师之最后彻底歼灭。蒋军在鲁南战役遭受空前惨败后，乃对山东战场改取“重点进攻”。蒋介石、阵诚亲临徐州直接指挥其叫嚣入云之“山东会战”。此时，郝逆鹏举背叛人民，就任蒋四二集团军总司令，并参加反人民的内战。我军乃于二月六日发起讨伐战役，歼其总部及第二、第四两个师，并生擒叛首郝鹏举。我主力于二月二十日至二十三日，突然出现于莱芜地区，一举歼灭蒋军北线兵团李仙洲所部七十三军、整四六师全部，及十二军之新三六师（缺一个团），共七个旅（师），我胶济线兵团于同时歼蒋第八军一○三师及一六六师之各一个团。我军乘胜扩张战果，收复胶济线两侧城镇。复于二月二十八日扫荡胶济东段蛤蟆屯至蔡家庄沿线百余里守敌交通警察第十五总队，而逼使胶济线蒋军困守济南昌（乐）（县）与青岛。莱芜败后，蒋介石、阵诚推卸战败责任予其帐下薛岳及军覆被俘无以置辩之李仙洲，而以顾祝同坐镇徐州，并从冀鲁豫战场抽调王敬久兵团，连同原在山东战场之汤恩伯兵团、欧震兵团，纠集十五个整编团于一线，策划再犯。我军于四月十二日发起泰安战役，于二十六日解放泰安城，歼灭蒋军整七二师，并乘胜解放宁阳城及晏城孝里铺等重地。为配合泰安战役，我军同时于蒙山东麓及蒙阴西南之九女关一线阻击蒋军整十一、整廿五、整七四、整六五等师，激战六昼夜，歼蒋军六千余。四月二十九日至五月一日，我军于临（沂）蒙（阴）路青驼寺、垛庄、界牌一线反击蒋军整八三师，歼其六三旅及四四旅之各一个团另一个搜索营。至五月十三日，我军于坦埠地区反击蒋军精锐主力整七四师，将其压缩至孟良崮，经激烈战斗后，十六日将其全部歼灭。与孟良崮战役同时，我军阻击敌整二十五、整八三、整六五、整七、整四八、整十一等师及第五军，杀伤其六千余人。蒋军经此惨重打击，乃重新调整部署，企图作冒险一逞。至六月二十八日止，仅有前哨接触，无大战斗。
