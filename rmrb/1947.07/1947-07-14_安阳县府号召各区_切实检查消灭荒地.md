    Anyang County Government Calls on All Districts
    Conscientiously Inspect and Eliminate Wasteland
    [This Newspaper Report] The Anyang County Government recently issued a circular calling on all districts and villages to conscientiously inspect and eliminate wasteland. It stated: "Upon receiving a letter from Secretary She of the Sixth District, it was learned that the Sixth District originally believed that all wasteland had been eliminated. However, after nearly two days of inspection, any remaining land after households had marked their plots would be the responsibility of the farmers' association. The inspection revealed that Fucheng had 420 mu of cultivated but fallow land and unassigned land, and Xijiang Village also had 400 mu of wasteland. After discussion by the village cadres, it was decided to organize the entire farmers' association labor force to carry out a three-day blitz to remove weeds, irrigate the land, and finish sowing. Currently, all men and women, young and old, in Xijiang Village, led by the cadres, are engaged in a blitz to remove seedlings. The amount of wasteland in these two villages of the Sixth District is quite alarming. From this experience, the seriousness of this problem can be seen. All districts and villages should immediately and conscientiously inspect whether all uncultivated land has been eliminated."

    安阳县府号召各区
    切实检查消灭荒地
    【本报讯】安阳县府顷发出通报，号召各区村认真检查消灭荒地。内称：接六区社分书来信，六区原先认为荒地消灭光了，可是经过近两天检查，家家插牌剩下的就归农会负责。检查结果，阜城又发现熟荒及未分配的土地有四百二十亩，西蒋村也有四百亩荒地，经过两村干部研究，组织全体农会劳力，在三天内突击锄完草、浇地下完种。现西蒋村全村男女老少，由干部带头正进行突击锄苗。六区这两村的荒地数字相当惊人，由这个经验，可看出这一个问题的严重性，各区各村应当即刻切实检查白地是否消灭光了。
