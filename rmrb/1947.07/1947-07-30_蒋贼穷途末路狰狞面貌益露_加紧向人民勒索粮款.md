　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: Nanjing dispatch: The Chiang government's Land and Grain Conference, attended by the chairmen of the Chiang-controlled provincial governments and speakers of provincial councils, opened on the 27th. Chiang Kai-shek personally attended, pointing out that extorting grain from the people to supply his counter-revolutionary civil war is one of the "central tasks" of the Chiang-controlled local governments from now on; lamenting, "If we (referring to the reactionary ruling clique) do not continue to struggle for survival, then we can only die!" (Associated Press dispatch) According to the Associated Press, Chiang's lament was also addressed to the speakers of the provincial councils, who generally represent landlords and have conflicts with the four major families, and some of whom had opposed the Chiang government's continued collection of grain in kind. Chiang Kai-shek's "State Council" passed the restoration of military grain requisition on the 18th; prior to this, due to popular opposition to grain requisition, the Land and Grain Conference convened by the Chiang government in May was forced to decide to abolish requisition. It is generally believed here (Nanjing) that the convocation of the Chiang government's Land and Grain Conference is one of the signals that the disasters of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas will be further aggravated after the "General Mobilization Order." Recently, Zhang Qun's memorandum to the Chiang-controlled councils stated that the past grain requisition was only enough for "half of the military grain" for his civil war, which means that the grain requisition this year will increase sharply by one time compared to the previous year. On the other hand, the Chiang government is opening various new levies and new taxes to extort money from the people. The recently rumored "Nation Building (?) Special Donation" was confirmed by Yu Hongjun's report at the Chiang-controlled council meeting on the 25th. It is said that the collection method has been drafted and will be implemented soon. It is claimed that "large households" will be "searched" and "progressively collected" through declaration, investigation, secret reports, and other methods. This shows that the four major families of Chiang, Kong, Song, and Chen, the largest tycoons, even though their rule is "perched under a dangerous curtain," will still not give up a single hair, but only rely on violence to force the people to pay. As for the four major families, taking Kong Xiangxi as an example, according to himself, he is "becoming poorer and poorer," and his foreign exchange deposits in the United States do not exceed 30,000 US dollars" (Associated Press Shanghai, 15th, quoting Kong Xiangxi). It is generally believed that people from all walks of life in the Chiang-controlled areas will continue to resist and evade the extortion of the traitorous, dictatorial, and civil war government. For example, since the "General Mobilization Order" was issued, the 10,000-yuan "comforting the troops" donation launched by the Chiang Party in Shanghai has been clamoring for a long time, but it has achieved nothing because the people simply ignored it. Now the Chiang government has revealed its ferocious face, turning "voluntary donations" into compulsory apportionments, demanding that "each household donate at least 10,000 yuan" (Central News Agency, Shanghai, 25th).

### 蒋贼穷途末路狰狞面貌益露　加紧向人民勒索粮款

　　蒋贼穷途末路狰狞面貌益露
  　加紧向人民勒索粮款
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】南京讯：由蒋记各省政府主席及各省参议会议长参加的蒋政府田粮会议已于二十七日开幕，蒋介石亲自出席，指出向人民勒索粮食供应其反革命内战为今后蒋记地方政府“中心工作”之一；哀鸣“我们（指反动统治集团）若不继续为生存而奋斗，则唯有死亡！”（美联社电）据美联社透露，蒋之哀鸣亦是讲给各省参议会议长听的，后者一般代表地主，而与四大家族有矛盾，有些人曾反对蒋政府继续征实。蒋介石“国务会议”十八日即通过恢复军粮征借；在此以前，由于人民反对征粮，五月间蒋政府召集的田粮会议曾被迫决议取消征借。此间（南京）咸信蒋政府田粮会议之召开，为“总动员令”后蒋管区人民灾难更为加深的信号之一。最近张群致蒋记参议会的备忘录中说，过去征粮数只够其内战“军粮的半数”，此即意味今年度征粮将比上年骤增一倍。另一方面，蒋政府正开办各种新摊派新捐税，向老百姓勒索金钱。最近盛传的“建国（？）特捐”，二十五日俞鸿钧在蒋记参驻会上的报告已予证实。谓已拟好征收办法，即将实行。据称：将经过申报、调查、密告等项办法以“寻找大户”，“累进征收”。此显示最大财主的蒋、孔、宋、陈四大家族，其统治虽“巢於危幕之下”，仍将一毛不拔，只一味仗恃暴力逼迫人民出钱。至于四大家族，以孔祥熙为例，据他自己说是“愈来愈变得很穷了”，在美国的外汇存款并不超过三万元”（美联社上海十五日电引孔祥熙语）。一般相信，蒋管区各界人民将继续抗拒和逃避卖国独裁内战政府的勒索。例如自“总动员令”下后，蒋党在上海发动的万元“劳军”捐款，虽叫嚣多时，却因人民根本不理毫无成绩。刻蒋政府已露出狰狞面孔，就“自愿捐输”为强迫摊派，要“每户至少捐献一万元”（中央社上海二十五日电）云。
