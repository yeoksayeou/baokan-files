　　Qixian New District Opens Canals for Rush Planting
[Report from this newspaper, Qixian] Qixian New District, in the midst of intense guerrilla warfare and the land reform movement, has also launched a drought resistance and famine preparedness campaign. Because the fourth and sixth districts of the county seized the opportunity during rainfall to rush plant three-quarters of the seedlings, the first, second, third, and fifth districts have not seen rain, with at most only one-fifth of the seedlings planted. Furthermore, as the Lesser Heat solar term has passed, the planting season is nearing its end. Therefore, the Qixian Party Committee issued an emergency call again on July 14th, mobilizing all party, government, military, and civilians to vigorously launch a campaign to prevent drought and prepare for famine. It emphasized that at present, the masses should be organized to repair canals, dig wells, and carry water to seize the time for rush planting. Through the efforts of all cadres, the drought resistance campaign throughout the county has been vigorously launched. Niu Shengtang, the director of the Construction Section of the County Government, organized the masses from nine villages, including Miaokou and Gejian, to work day and night, restoring three canals: from Miaokou to Daozhuang, from Gengwusi to Yuanbenmiao, and from Miaokou Village East to Hanyao. According to accurate calculations, these canals can irrigate at least 25 hectares of land during the 20-plus day planting period. Currently, 10 hectares and 40 mu have already been irrigated. Under this influence, Xiantangang is now also rushing to repair a large canal, and Yuquan is newly building three small canals. These four canals can also be completed soon, irrigating more than 30 hectares of land in total. Various places have also universally launched a campaign to dig wells and carry water for spot planting. For example, in the front-line villages of the third district, with the active protection of our county's large teams and district teams, they have also organized well digging and land irrigation. In areas closer to the river but without many canals to repair, such as Shangcao Village and other twenty villages, women, the elderly, and children have all rushed to carry and draw water for rush planting. In Xiaoniuzhuang Village, out of nine households, eight men, six women, and seven children participated, rush planting 15 mu of corn in one and a half days. Villages that cannot repair canals, dig wells, or rush plant are now focusing on dry planting. The masses are saying, "Where there is drought, there will be continuous rain; if we don't dry plant, the rain will be late." It is estimated that the county's planting task can be completely completed before August 6th. (Jundou)

　　淇县新区开渠抢种
    【本报淇县讯】淇县新区从紧张的游击战争与土地改革运动结合中，又开展了抗旱备荒运动，因全县除四、六区趁雨抢种了捉苗四分之三外，一、二、三、五区均因指雨未下，最多不过捉苗五分之一。更因小暑已过，下种时期将尽，因此淇县党委会，特于七月十四日重新发出紧急号召，动员全体党政军民，大力突击防旱备荒。强调指出，在目前更应组织群众修渠、挖井、担水，抓紧时间突击抢种。经过全体干部的努力突击，全县的抗旱运动已猛烈的开展起来了。县府建设科长牛生堂同志组织了庙口、葛间等九个村的群众日夜突击，恢复了庙口至道庄、更五寺至袁本庙、庙口村东至韩窑，共三道水渠，经切实计算在二十多天下种期内最少可浇地二十五顷，现在已浇十顷零四十亩。在这一影响下，现在又有仙谈岗突击修一道大渠，鱼泉新修三道小渠，这四道水渠最近亦可修通，共可浇地三十余顷。各地并普遍开展了挖井担水点种运动，如三区的接敌村，在我县大队区干队积极活动掩护下，亦纷纷组织挖井浇地，在离河较近但不多修渠的地方，如上曹村等二十余村了妇女老少一齐涌上担水提水抢种运动，小牛庄村共九户就有八个男人，六个女人七个儿童参加，一天半内抢种玉茭十五亩，不能修渠打井和急种的村现在正突击干种，群众都说：“有旱就有连阴雨，若不旱种，等雨就会迟。”估计全县下种任务在八月六号以前可彻底完成。（骏斗）
