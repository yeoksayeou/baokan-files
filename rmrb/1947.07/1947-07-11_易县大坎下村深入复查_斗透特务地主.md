Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀, 8th. In Dakanxia Village, Yi County, West Hebei, the mass line was followed to reignite the land reform movement. In the initial stage of the village's re-examination, the leadership failed to delve deeply into the masses, resulting in insufficient mobilization, and most landlords escaped. Prominent special agent landlord Yin Luoshi and others were not thoroughly purged at all, and the interests of middle peasants were violated. The distribution of fruits was also unfair, following a rich peasant line. The distribution of farm tools and livestock was carried out through a discounted auction method, resulting in poor peasants receiving money accounting for only 35% of the total. As for the land, the poor peasants received some remote and poor land. On June 3rd, the work team arrived in the village. After detailed understanding, they immediately organized the masses, with poor peasants as the backbone, to voice their grievances and stand up. At the same time, seizing the opportunity as the masses had already risen, they promptly enlightened the village cadres, reversing their fear of mass opinions and their psychology of confronting poor peasants. They put forward slogans such as: "Poor peasant bones, middle peasant flesh, bones and flesh inseparable, everyone stands up together." "Fill the big pits first, then the small pits." From then on, poor and suffering peasants became active, the morale of middle peasants was raised, and village cadres also conducted self-criticism at mass meetings, returning the fruits they had over-received in the past. The spearhead of the struggle was unanimously directed at the landlords. The special agent landlord Yin Luoshi and Yin Wentang, who pretended to be poor, were overthrown. The work in the village is now continuing to develop vigorously. When Yin Wentang was overthrown, the masses were extremely excited and performed "The White Haired Girl" to celebrate their liberation.

    易县大坎下村深入复查
    斗透特务地主
    【新华社晋察冀八日电】冀西易县大坎下村，走群众路线重新掀起土地改革运动。该村复查前期，由于领导上没深入群众，致群众未能充分发动，地主大部漏网。著名特务地主殷洛士等均根本未被清算，同时又侵犯了中农利益，果实分配也不公平，走了富农路线。分农具、牲口是采用折价拍卖办法，结果贫农分钱的只占总数的百分之三十五。至于土地贫农所得的也是一些远地、坏地。六月三日工作组到了该村，经详细了解后，即一面以贫农为骨干，组织群众诉苦翻身，一面趁群众已经起来，抓紧时机，启发村干部，扭转了怕群众提意见和与贫农对抗的心理。提出：“贫农骨头中农肉，骨肉不分离，翻身大家翻”。“先填大坑后填小坑”等口号。至此，贫苦农民活跃，中农情绪提高，村干部也在群众大会上进行了自我批评，退出了过去多得的果实，斗争锋芒一致对准了地主；当将该村特务地主殷洛士和装穷的殷文堂斗倒。现该村工作仍继续蓬勃发展中。斗倒殷文堂时，群众兴奋万分，曾演出“白毛女”庆祝翻身。
