Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Tokyo News: The Japanese government recently, according to the decision of the US military headquarters, strengthened its control over Chinese overseas Chinese in Japan. In addition to ordering them to register with the Japanese government and pay ordinary taxes, unreasonable restrictions have also been placed on the types of businesses that overseas Chinese can operate. This measure has aroused widespread dissatisfaction among our overseas Chinese in Japan, who believe that this is a discriminatory policy against Chinese overseas Chinese. They have raised objections to the Chiang government's delegation in Japan, requesting them to negotiate on their behalf. However, the Chiang family representatives, who are inherently traitorous, not only failed to actively safeguard the interests of overseas Chinese but also shamelessly issued a statement on the 7th "appealing" to overseas Chinese to comply with the decisions of the US military headquarters and the Japanese government.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: According to a United Press Shanghai 8th dispatch: An editorial published in the Ta Kung Pao, which is affiliated with the Political Science faction, revealed the Chiang government's consistent attitude of subservience and flattery towards Japan. The editorial, commenting on Japan's statement that plebiscites should be held in Manchuria, Taiwan, Ryukyu, and Korea to determine which country these territories should belong to, argued that the Chiang government had not adopted a firm stance on its Japan policy. It pointed out that the Chiang government seemed more indifferent to the situation in Japan than Australia and the Netherlands, and even worse than Norway. Norway even protested against the Japanese whaling expedition in the Arctic Ocean. The editorial revealed that the Chiang government had not prepared for a peace treaty with Japan, and that for the past two years, the Chiang government had been supplying Japan with the iron and salt it needed.

    蒋介石媚日
    留日侨胞提出抗议
    【新华社陕北九日电】东京消息：日本政府近突然按照美军总部之决定，加强对中国在日侨胞之管制。除令向日政府登记并缴纳普通税外，对侨胞营业种类亦加以无理限制。此种措置已引起我驻日侨胞之普遍不满，认为此显系对待中国侨胞一种歧视政策，彼等曾为此向蒋政府驻日代表团提出异议，要求代为交涉。但卖国成性之蒋家代表，对侨胞利益不但不予积极维护，反厚颜无耻地于七日发表谈话“吁请”侨胞遵行美军总部及日政府之决定。
    【新华社陕北九日电】据合众社上海八日电：政学系的大公报所发表社论中，透露蒋政府对日本一贯的顺从奉迎态度。该社论于评论日本关于满洲、台湾、琉球及朝鲜应举行全民投票，以决定此等领土应属于何国的声明时，认为蒋政府在对日政策上未采取强硬立场。指出蒋政府对日本局势似乎较澳洲及荷兰更漠不关心，甚至连挪威都不如。挪威还抗议日本远征捕鲸队在北极海捕鲸。社论透露蒋政府未作对日和约准备，且在过去两年来蒋政府一直供应日本所需要的铁和盐。
