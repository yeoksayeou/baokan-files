　　Breaking the Mold of Compulsory Combination
  　Some Problems and Experiences in Production Mutual Aid in the New District of Wu'an
    Er Dong
    Most parts of the new district of Wu'an have not had rain for a long time, and a poor harvest this autumn is certain. What can be done now is, first, to plant all the existing seedlings. Second, prepare rapeseed and rush to plant autumn vegetables as soon as it rains, and some flat land can also be used to plant some late millet. Another thing that farmers think is very important is "picking and chopping" (engaging in sideline occupations).
    To ensure the smooth progress of both agriculture and sideline occupations, it is necessary to organize universally, because, first, engaging in sideline occupations requires running far away. In case it rains immediately, someone at home must help with farm work. Second, farmers have little personal capital and cannot earn much money. They must pool funds for joint operations (of course, there are also people with a lot of capital, but they are a minority). Third, weeding seedlings now also requires mutual assistance, otherwise no one can go out. A few villages in the Eighth District (such as Chongyi) have already created mutual aid groups that combine agriculture and sideline occupations: some groups spare one or two people to engage in sideline occupations with everyone's funds, and the whole group is responsible for planting the land at home, which will be repaid in the future, and the money earned will be divided into 20% for the public and 80% for the individual (some are 30% for the public and 70% for the individual); some are organized to take turns going out, and what they earn is for themselves. The types of sideline occupations include selling tables and cabinets in the east to buy grain, selling clothes in the west to buy grain, and carrying burdens to repair pots and mend sieves.
    These are all important innovations in the new district, but they are not widespread. On the contrary, farmers generally lack experience and habits of mutual assistance, and some misunderstand mutual assistance, clearly helping but secretly not helping, helping in slack seasons but not helping in busy seasons. Mutual assistance in slack times is actually just gathering to chat and play, and when it comes to rushing to plant or urgently weeding seedlings, everyone is "Hurry up and do your own thing, don't dare to help each other (referring to playing)." Those with livestock and more labor do not say a word and go to the fields far away, and those who lack livestock and labor want to find them, but are afraid of delaying their own work, so they also go to their own fields. Hardworking and capable people and honest and loyal people avoid lazy people, sharp heads (those who harm others and benefit themselves), and "riverbed leakers" (some call them bottomless pits, referring to spendthrifts who live off their assets), and the masses avoid cadres. Some village cadres even announce to the masses "Disband, no more mutual assistance" as soon as the district cadres leave. This is so as not to go against the mood of the masses. (The above situation is from Beixizhuang, but it is more or less the same everywhere)
    What is the reason? The main reason is fear of suffering losses. Most of the mutual aid groups here were temporarily organized by village cadres during the Great Participation in the War and cotton planting periods. The slogan of "Four Stoppages (Equalization) and Three Cares" was also somewhat subjective at the time. The so-called four stoppages meant stopping land, livestock, and labor, and dividing the households without labor and the households participating in the war. That is, each group was equally allocated a certain amount of livestock and labor to share a certain amount of substitute farming tasks (substitute farming for those participating in the war and the families of soldiers); among the three cares, everyone had no objection to caring for military families and those participating in the war, but everyone was unwilling to care for households without labor. In fact, as a result of "stopping and dividing," some lazy people, sharp heads, and riverbed leakers were also assigned to each group. What was said was to separate and transform them, but in the eyes of the farmers, it was sharing bad luck. So they called the mutual aid groups substitute farming teams. And because everyone had worked together to turn over in the past, they always said, "Farmers are one family, no matter what, let's just do it." Of course, it could not be consolidated.
    The county party committee recently called for breaking the mold of compulsory combination and voluntarily combining, and Chongyi had a thorough voluntary combination. At first, some village cadres were afraid that this would lead to a complete collapse and that mutual assistance would not be possible again, but the result was the opposite, and mutual assistance developed. Honest and hardworking farmers all voluntarily combined with households that were capable and suitable. Of the 500 or so households in the whole village, the last remaining were more than 30 sharp heads, lazy people, and households without labor. At the same time, the leaders commended the village's models of frugality and labor, and the farmers criticized some lazy sharp heads in the discussion of frugality and famine preparedness. And they simply proposed "Never fill the gully again after it's filled." "We are not responsible for starving lazy people to death." Some of the people who were squeezed out began to feel pessimistic, but some of the sharp heads and lazy people then made up their minds to change and quickly became better, and the first one to change was immediately commended, and then several others changed, and they organized themselves to compete with other good groups and became good groups themselves; some, after being squeezed out, went everywhere to say good things to others, made guarantees, and vowed to get up early and work hard, and as a result, they negotiated terms with others and were individually absorbed. The more than ten households without labor were very panicked at first, but the farmers quickly created new methods: one was to have the mutual aid groups with surplus labor contract to plant for them; tilling and harrowing an acre of land would cost a total of three catties of rice. The other was for the cooperative to regulate livestock and manpower. Households with surplus labor went to the cooperative to find work, and those who lacked it went to the cooperative to find people and livestock. The cooperative was responsible for negotiating prices, accounting, and there were no more disputes.
    Chongyi's method has enabled agriculture and sideline occupations to develop simultaneously: the sown area of the whole village has accounted for nine-tenths of the cultivated land, and the remaining one-tenth can be sown as soon as it rains, leaving no wasteland. All eighteen hectares of cotton have been weeded three times (some have been weeded four times), early millet has been weeded twice, and late millet, corn, and mung beans are just beginning to be weeded. Corn and mung beans were planted in the sparse areas of cotton seedlings, and rapeseed was generally prepared, and vegetables were generally planted as soon as it rained. At the same time as weeding seedlings, more than 50 people went out to repair pots to earn money. Among them, in addition to 20 skilled workers, the rest of the assistants were all old people and children assigned by the mutual aid groups, which did not delay the main labor force. Sun Quanyi and others earned 50,000 yuan in half a month and bought 400 catties of millet. Women have all been organized under three forms: one is the five small textile factories in the five streets, with a total of more than 40 people; one is a group of girls aged 11 to 16 learning to weave, and the other is a group of women who cannot leave their homes forming ordinary weaving groups, who weave together in addition to housework. The 500 women in the whole village plan to weave four catties of cloth per person before autumn. In addition, the several types of buying and selling and transportation activities mentioned above have also begun. The general slogan of the village is "Weave three, spare one, chop (sideline) three, spare one, save three, spare one." That is, three days of work is enough for four days of eating and use. Chongyi is now full of confidence in overcoming the drought.
    Chongyi's method of thoroughly voluntary mutual aid production should be the way for the new district of Wu'an to overcome the famine. This method has been implemented in many villages in Wu'an, making the movement gain new progress.

　　打破编制自愿结合
  　武安新区生产互助中一些问题与经验
    而东
    武安新区大部地方久未透雨，今秋歉收已经肯定。现在可以做的事情，一个是把现有的禾苗都种出来。一个是准备菜籽，一落雨就抢种秋菜，有些平地还可种些晚谷。另一件农民认为很重要的事情就是“拾砍”（搞副业）。
    要使农副业同时顺利进行，必须普遍组织起来，因为第一，搞副业要往远处跑。万一马上落了雨，家里农事得有人互助。第二，农民个人资金少，赚不了许多钱，必须集资合营（当然也有资金多的人，但是少数）。第三，眼下锄苗也得有互助，不然出不去人。八区少数村庄（如崇义）农民已经自己创造出农副业结合的互助组：有的是每组腾出一、二人去，以大家资金搞副业，家里地全组负责种，将来还工，赚回钱来二八分红（公二个人八，有的是公三个人七）；有的是组织起来，轮流外出，自己赚上归自己。副业的种类，有以桌柜到东边卖了买粮的，有以衣服到西面卖了买粮的，有挑担子出去补锅、张箩的。
    这些在新区说来都是重要创造，但很不普遍。反之，农民普遍缺乏互助经验与习惯，有的对互助有误解，明互助暗不互助，闲互助忙不互助。闲时候的互助实际是到一块打哈哈玩耍，一到抢种或紧锄苗时，大家都是“赶快各干各的吧，可不敢互助（指玩耍）啦。”有牲口的、劳力多的，不吭气远远的上地去了，缺牲口、缺劳力的想去找他们，又怕误了自己活，也上自己地去了。勤劳能干的和忠厚老实的躲着懒汉、尖头（损人利己家伙）与“河涝床”（有人叫他没底坑，指坐吃山空的浪费者）走，群众躲着干部走。甚至有的村干部见区干部一走，就向群众宣布“解散，不互助啦。”这是为的不违背群众情绪。（上述情形是北西庄的，但各地大半都有些）
    什么原因呢？主要是怕吃亏。这里的互助组大部是在大参战与点种棉花时期临时由村干编制起来的。“四停（平均）三照顾”的口号，在当时也是有些主观主义的。所谓四停，就是土地停，牲口停，劳力停，把无劳力户与参战户分停。就是各组平均配置一定的牲口劳力，分担一定的代耕任务（代耕参战者与抗属地）；三照顾中，照顾军属，参战的大家没有话说，但照顾无劳力户大家就不愿意。实际上“停分”的结果，有些懒汉、尖头、河涝床也分到了各组。说的是分开改造，在农民看来是分担倒霉。所以他们把互助组叫做代耕队。而由于过去大家曾一块闹过翻身，总是讲着“农民是一家，管他哩，就这吧。”当然不能巩固下去。
    县委最近号召打破编制自愿结合，崇义来了个彻底自愿。开始有些村干部怕这样会彻底垮台，再互助不起来，但结果相反，互助发展了。忠厚的、有劳力的农民都各自与对事的、相当的户自愿结合了。全村五百来户、最后剩下来的是三十多户尖头、懒汉及无劳力户。与此同时，领导上表扬了该村的节约与劳动模范，农民在讨论节约备荒中批评了一些懒汉尖头。并干脆提出“填满圪道再不填。”“饿死懒汉不负责”。被挤出来的人开始有些悲观，但有的尖头懒汉就从此下定决心转变，很快变好了，第一个转变了的马上受到表扬，跟着就又有好几个转变，并组织起来和其他好组竞赛，自己也成了好组；也有的在被挤出来后，到处去给人家说好话，提保证，立誓起早搭黑好好干，结果和人家讲好条件个别吸收了。十多户无劳力的，开始时很恐慌，但农民很快创造了新的办法：一种是由有富余劳力的互助组给包种；把一亩地耩好，耢好一共三斤米。另一种是由合作社调剂牲口人力。有余力户去合作社找活，缺的到合作社找人与牲口。合作社负责讲价，算帐，纠纷没了。
    崇义的办法，已使农副业同时获得进展：全村下种地已占耕地十分之九，其余十分之一有雨即可种完，不留一亩荒地。十八顷棉花都已锄过三遍（有的已锄过四遍），早谷已锄过二遍，晚谷玉茭和绿豆正开始锄。棉苗稀处点种了玉茭、绿豆，并普遍准备菜籽，一下雨就普遍种菜。与锄苗同时，有五十来人出去补锅赚钱。其中除二十个把式外，其余副手全是互助组拨的老人和孩子，并不耽误主要劳力。孙全义等二人出去半月赚了五万元，买小米四百斤。妇女在三种形式下已全部组织起来，一种是五条街的五个小型纺织工厂，共四十余人；一种是十一至十六岁的女孩集体学纺织，另一种是离不得家的妇女结成普通纺织小组，除家里杂活外即到一块纺织。全村五百妇女，计划秋前每人织布四斤。此外，前面说到的几种买卖运输活动也已开始。该村的总口号是“织三余一、砍（副）三余一、节三余一。”即是三天弄够四天吃用。崇义现在是充满战胜旱灾的信心。
    崇义彻底自愿互助生产的办法，应该是武安新区生产渡荒的道路。这一办法已在武安许多村开始实行，使运动获得新的进展。
