　　"Receiving" Enemy and Puppet Materials All Into Private Pockets
　　A Huge Embezzlement Case Occurs in Qingdao
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 24th]程义德 (Cheng Yide), the director of the Chiang Kai-shek's Qingdao Municipal Enemy and Puppet Industry Administration Bureau, embezzled hundreds of billions of yuan. A person named Yan Zhendong, a resident of Taixi, distributed leaflets and published huge advertisements in Qingdao on the 21st of last month, exposing the director's crimes. The listed embezzlement facts with verifiable figures include: 1. 9,000 tons of enemy and puppet materials were transported away without bidding in April of this year. 2. Taxes not paid for the transported materials amounted to 7 billion yuan. 3. The entire buildings, machinery, and materials of the enemy exchange (i.e., the stock exchange), with a base price of 3 billion yuan, were sold for only 200 million yuan as recorded. In addition, someone reported to the Chiang Kai-shek's Gendarmerie Regiment that he privately hid enemy and puppet materials, with the embezzlement from the basement of 60 Guancheng Road alone worth 2 billion yuan. The enemy and puppet property and materials stored in Qingdao are unparalleled except for Nanjing and Shanghai. However, Cheng Yide has not issued any public announcements regarding the amount of enemy and puppet property received and the handling process. In his questioning advertisement, Yan stated that the actual embezzlement figure of Cheng must be several or ten times this amount. As a result, street talks and discussions caused a sensation for a time. The Chiang Kai-shek authorities, deeply fearing that they would not be able to step down from this scandal, have transferred him to Nanjing to take up a new position in the "Resources Committee." This huge embezzlement case was thus covered up under the protection of the Chiang clique.

　　“接收”敌伪物资尽入私囊
  　青岛发生贪污巨案
    【新华社山东二十四日电】蒋记青岛市敌伪产业管理局局长程义德贪污达数百亿元。有署名台西市民阎振东者，于上月二十一日在青岛散布传单及刊登巨幅广告，揭发该局长罪行，列举贪污事实而有数字可稽者计有：一、今年四月未经标售而运走的敌伪物资达九千吨。二、运走物资而未缴税款者达七十亿元。三、敌取引所（即交易所）全部房屋机器物资底价卅亿元，仅以二亿元售出列帐。此外并有人向蒋记宪兵团告发其私自藏匿敌伪物资，仅贪污观城路六十号地下室一处即值二十亿元。敌伪在青所存财产物资，除宁、沪外无与伦比。然程义德对接收敌伪财物数额及处理经过迄无公报。阎氏在其质询广告中，谓程某贪污实际数字必数倍或十倍于此。因之街谈巷议，轰动一时。蒋记当局深恐其无法下台，已将其调往南京，就任“资源委员会”新职。此一贪污巨案遂在蒋党包庇下不了了之。
