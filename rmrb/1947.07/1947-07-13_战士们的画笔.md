    The Warriors' Paintbrushes
    Gao Shilin
    Now (the Wujiang Unit) warriors all understand art, and are all top-notch warrior artists. They treat it as a gift to heroes, and sometimes use paintings as a form of mutual political work, criticizing shortcomings and promoting positive qualities. General Liu Bocheng's warriors not only develop new tactics but are also the people's painters. Now the warriors in the companies are producing large-scale picture newspapers, especially the warriors of the Wujiang Unit's Third Battalion, who bring out their paintings to congratulate each other on their merits. Some paint in the trenches, and some paint at the encampment after marching forty or fifty *li* at night. From then on, painting has greatly developed. No matter who it is, especially the emancipated new warriors, they deeply feel that they could not have the opportunity to study under the oppression of the landlords. If you could read, that was a matter for the rich. The possibility of painting was even more out of reach. Now that they have been emancipated and have come to the ranks of the People's Liberation Army, they have all learned to paint and read, because even if they can't read, they can paint. I lived in the Sixth Company of the 58th Regiment for a relatively long period, living in the squads, and from this point of view, the warriors have a genius for painting. At the same time, a Taiwanese warrior named Chen Guoying was cultivated. Now he is a member of the Party among the Taiwanese soldiers. He can paint and paints very well. When the news of the Third Column destroying three tanks came, he was asked to paint a picture of a tank being destroyed. He knew how to use perspective, painting the distant tanks small and the near ones large. Now he is a very skilled painter. He looks for materials to paint everywhere. Later, warrior painters continued to emerge. Li Zongqing of the Third Company painted a picture praising the Quartermaster, and also wrote a few lines of clapper rhyme: "The Quartermaster, is really strong, Carries rice back to get grain." The Quartermaster is painted pushing a small cart with rice sacks on it, the Quartermaster with a smiling face, pushing the cart. There is also Fan Tianyi, a warrior of the Fifth Company, who painted a picture praising the squad leader for carrying more than a dozen loads of water. Clerk Geng Gan also painted one. The Second Battalion Headquarters organized a warrior slogan writing team, and the warriors all started painting. Now General Liu Bocheng's warriors have learned to use two guns, one is a rifle and the other is a paintbrush.

    战士们的画笔
    高诗林
    现在（乌江部）战士们都开始懂得艺术，而且都是顶好的战士美术家，他们把它当做贺英雄的礼物，有时也把画当做互相批评的一种政治工作，批评缺点，发扬正气优点，刘伯承将军的战士不光会发挥新的战法，而且是人民的画家，现在战士们在连队中，出大型的画报，尤其是乌江部三大队战士们拿出画来互相贺功，有的在战壕沟中画，有的晚上行军四、五十里地到宿营地也画。从此画就大大的发展了，不管什么人，尤其翻身的新战士们，他们深深感到受地主的压迫不能有读书的可能，如果说能认识字那是有钱人的事，画画的可能更是没有了，现在翻了身来到人民解放军的队伍中了，他们都学会画画、识字，因为不识字就可以画画。我在五八团六连住了较长一个期间，生活在班里，从这一点上看战士们是有画画的天才的，同时培养了个台湾战士，名字叫陈国英，现在他是台湾兵中的党员了，他能画而且画得非常好，当时三纵队击毁坦克车三辆的消息传到时，便叫他画了这样一副坦克车被击毁的一张画，他知道用透视学，远的坦克车画得小小的，近处大，现在他已经是很熟练的画家了，他到处找材料画，以后战士画家不断的产生了，三连李宗卿画了一副表扬事务长的画，还写了几句快板：事务长，真是强，背米回来去领粮，画着事务长推一小车，车上放着米口袋，事务长笑着脸，推着车。还有五连战士范天义，画的表扬班长同志担水十几担。文书耿干也画了一副，二营营部组织了战士写标语队，战士们都画起来了，现在刘伯承将军的战士学会用两支枪了，一支是步枪，另一支是画笔。
