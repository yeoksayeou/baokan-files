　　Over a Thousand Cadres Sent South
[This newspaper's dispatch from Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 23rd] The Second District of Hebei-Shandong-Henan has dispatched over a thousand district and village cadres to Henan to vigorously carry out the land reform movement in the newly recovered areas. The Second District Committee previously selected over a thousand district and village cadres from eight counties, including Yuncheng, to concentrate on studying, reviewing the past land reform movement, and discussing how to implement re-investigations and completely eliminate the landlord class in the future. For the past half-month, the students have been in high spirits, resolving their confused understanding of the landlord class. On July 3rd, the school ended early, and the students went south with the army. Upon hearing the news, all the students were extremely excited, determined to avenge the peasants. Each team then crossed the river south day and night. Before leaving, the students donated all their saved rice, approximately 150,000 yuan, to support the front lines.

In addition, the Second Branch Bureau of the District Industry and Commerce Administration has also dispatched cadres to the south bank of the Yellow River to carry out industrial and commercial economic work in the recovered areas.

　　冀鲁豫二分区
  　千余干部南下
    【本报冀鲁豫二十三日电】冀鲁豫二分区派遣区村干部千余人开赴河南，大力开展新收复区土地改革运动。二地委前曾抽调郓城等八县区村干部千余人集中学习，检查过去一段土地改革运动，及今后如何贯彻复查，彻底消灭地主阶级。半月来，学员情绪很高，解决了对地主阶级认识上的糊涂观念。七月三日，学校提前结束，随军南下，学员闻讯，莫不兴奋异常，决心为农民复仇。各队遂分别星夜南渡。临行时，学员将全部节约米约十五万元全数献出支援前线。
    此外，本区工商管理局二分局，亦派遣干部，赴黄河南岸进行收复区工商经济工作。
