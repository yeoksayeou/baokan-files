Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th—According to a United Press reporter, Keleman, reporting from Shenyang: The industrial system in the Northeast Chiang Kai-shek area, controlled by Kuomintang bureaucratic capital and supplying its needs for the civil war, has been shattered and paralyzed due to the rapid development of the Northeast Democratic Allied Forces' offensive. Keleman said: Of the four industrial centers in Manchuria, the three cities of Shenyang, Changchun, and Jilin, held by the Kuomintang (excluding Harbin), have been isolated except for air transport. However, the limited number of aircraft and the adverse weather conditions make the air routes difficult to keep open. Most of the railway between Changchun and Shenyang has been completely destroyed; between Fushun and Shenyang, only horse-drawn carts can now be used. Due to the complete isolation of the three major cities and the fact that they are constantly in danger, the power supply in these cities is also experiencing problems. Currently, only Jilin can still use the electricity from Xiaofengman. The capture of Beipiao has forced Jinzhou and Fushun to completely rely on the Fushun Power Plant. The output of the Fushun Coal Mine, which mainly supplies the Kuomintang railway transportation and military industry, is also rapidly declining. Keleman believes that the destruction of the Northeast Kuomintang military industrial system will bring serious consequences to the Northeast Kuomintang army.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Jicha-Rehe-Liaoning, 10th—The Shenyang-published Chiang Kai-shek army's newspaper "Peace Daily" (formerly "Sweeping Bandit Newspaper") has also lost confidence in the current situation in Shenyang. The newspaper's editorial on June 16, "Rambling Talks on the Beacon Fire," stated: "Today's wartime Shenyang, everything seems chaotic, everything seems weak," and the primary reason is due to the "special class" (referring to Chiang's officials) who started the chaos. They fled at the first sign of trouble, either flying to Shanghai or going to Beiping, causing widespread panic. The article revealed dissatisfaction with Du Yuming's panic-stricken behavior, pointing out that he only frantically grabbed people to build fortifications when the Democratic Allied Forces approached Shenyang, expressing dissatisfaction by saying, "We cannot deeply agree with all kinds of last-minute efforts." It also said, "The lack of preparation in peacetime and the current chaotic state is truly regrettable."

    民主联军强大攻势打击下
    东北蒋区工业支离破碎
    合众社记者指出将予蒋军严重后果
    【新华社陕北十一日电】据合众社记者克莱曼自沈阳报导：为国民党官僚资本所控制供应其内战军事需要的东北蒋区工业体系，由于东北民主联军攻势的迅速发展，已被打得支离破碎，而陷于麻痹状态。克莱曼说：满洲的四个工业中心，除哈尔滨外，握在国民党手中的沈阳、长春与吉林三个城市，除空运外，已被孤立。而有限的飞机与恶劣的气候，使航空线亦难于畅通。长春至沈阳间的铁路大部被彻底破坏；抚顺至沈阳间，现在只能使用着马车。由于三大城市的完全被切断及经常处在危险之中，这些城市的动力亦发生问题，现在小丰满的电力只有吉林尚可使用。北票的被攻占，迫使锦州、抚顺完全依赖抚顺动力厂。主要供应国民党铁路交通及军事工业的抚顺煤矿，产量亦急骤下降中。克莱曼认为东北国民党军事工业体系的被破坏，会带给东北国民党军以严重结果。
    【新华社冀察热辽十日电】沈阳出版之蒋军机关报“和平日报”（原“扫荡报”），对沈阳之现状亦失掉信心。该报六月十六日社论“烽火漫谈”中称：“今日的战时沈阳，一切都显得混乱，一切都显得松弱，”其原因首由“特殊阶级”（指蒋家官员）乱起，他们闻风逃逸，或飞上海，或走北平，弄的人心惶惶。该文泄露对杜聿明张惶失措，当民主联军进迫沈阳时，才慌忙抓人筑工事，表示不满称：“我们现在对种种临急抱佛脚的行动，不能深表赞同。”并说：“平时准备不够，现在手忙脚乱的姿态，实在使人遗憾。”
