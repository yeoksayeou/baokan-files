　　Fucheng Masses Enthusiastically Enlist in the Army
  　Strengthen the Main Force for Crossing the River and Counterattacking
　　[Our newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 23rd dispatch] When our counter-offensive army victoriously moved south and recovered Dingtao, the masses in the Fucheng guerrilla area, led by County Chief Wang and Political Commissar Hu, launched an army enlistment movement. In the enemy's rear guerrilla environment, the county not only bravely carried out joint defense to protect their homes, but also worked together to carry out land reform and re-examination, which universally raised the awareness of the peasants. When the counter-offensive army moved south and recovered Dingtao, the districts, villages, and agencies of the county all prepared to join the army, and the counter-offensive sentiment was very high. Political Commissar Hu, County Chief Wang, Deputy Director of the Armed Forces Committee, and others all took oaths to join the army. Then, comrades from various departments and districts also responded bravely, with 128 people signing up on the spot. Comrade Lu Junyi from the First District stood up with tears in his eyes and said: "When the enemy came, my father was killed, and the children at home ran away. The enemy followed and caught them, and even implicated relatives and neighbors who were all fined. I will never go home until old Jiang is defeated!" During the meeting in Houji District, many young people bravely signed up to join the army. The Hui people of Houji said, "Our Hui people guarantee to establish a Hui battalion." The two sub-districts of Laojia and Tudi Miao each made a guarantee: "We will form a company." At the model hero meeting in the Eighth District, the West Sub-district automatically signed up 110 people, the East Sub-district 23 people, and the South Sub-district 13 people, totaling 146 people. Currently, various districts are still in a heatwave of enlistment competition.
　　[Our newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 24th dispatch] The stretcher teams of liberated peasants everywhere are supporting the counter-offensive and launching a meritorious service competition. When the masses of Housu Village in Qingfeng learned that the army's southward counter-offensive required stretchers, militiamen and self-defense team members Du Yufa and five others bravely volunteered to go. When they set off, the villagers waved flags and beat gongs and drums to see them off. They also shouted, "The poor have turned over, and participation in the war must be serious!" Those who set off also expressed: "Go to the front to perform meritorious service and strive to make our village a model!" The Qingfeng Chengguan stretcher team held a meritorious service campaign meeting in the garrison, setting off a meritorious service competition. Mr. Jin Yonghua from Shacun, Guancheng, was selected as a stretcher model in the previous Tangyin campaign. This time, when he learned that stretchers were needed again, he was originally not supposed to go, but he insisted on going, saying: "I opened a carpentry shop for more than ten years, saving money. This year, I was allocated four mu of land. I am fifty-eight years old this year. If I don't rush to go twice, it won't work later!" When he set off, the masses awarded him a big, white straw hat with the words "Stretcher Model" written on it.

  　加强渡河反攻主力
    【本报冀鲁豫廿三日电】复程游击区群众，在我反攻大军胜利南下收复定陶时，王县长、胡政委等带领群众掀起参军运动。该县在敌后游击环境下，一面英勇联防看家，一面合力进行土改与复查，农民觉悟普遍提高。反攻大军南下收复定陶时，该县各区、村各机关纷纷酝酿参军，反攻情绪十分高涨。胡政委、王县长、武委会副主任等，都宣誓参军。接着各科局、各区同志也都奋勇的响应，当场报名者，一百二十八人。一区卢君义同志泪流满面的站起来说：“敌人来时，我父亲被杀了，家里孩子跑出去，敌人跟着抓，连累的亲戚邻居都罚光了，打不死老蒋，我决不回家！”侯集区开会时，许多青年奋勇报名参军。侯集回民说：“俺回民保证成立一个回民营。”老家、土地庙两小区各提出保证：“成一个连。”八区在英模大会上，西小区自动报名一百一十人，东小区二十三人，南小区十三人，共一百四十六人。现各区仍在参军竞赛热潮中。
    【本报冀鲁豫二十四日电】各地翻身农民支援反攻之担架队，开展立功竞赛。清丰后苏村群众当知道大军南下反攻需要担架时，自卫队员和民兵杜玉法等六人，奋勇报名前去，出发时村里群众打着旗，锣鼓喧天的欢送。并高呼：“穷人翻了身，参战要认真！”出发的人也表示：“上前方立功，争取咱村作模范！”清丰城关担架队，在驻地召开立功运动大会，掀起了立功竞赛。观城沙村靳永华老先生在前次汤阴战役时曾被选为担架模范，这次当他知道又要出担架时，本来不该他去，但他非去不可，他说：“我过去开了十几年的木匠铺，省吃俭用，今年分了四亩地，俺今年五十八岁了，如不抢着去两趟往后就不中了！”出发时，群众奖给他一顶大又白的草帽，上写着“担架模范”。
