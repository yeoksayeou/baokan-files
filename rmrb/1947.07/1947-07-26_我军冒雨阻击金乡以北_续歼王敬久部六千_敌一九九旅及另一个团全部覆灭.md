　　Xinhua News Agency, Jilu Yu Front, 24th -- General Liu Bocheng's troops annihilated another brigade and another regiment of Chiang's army in the area north of Jinxiang on the 22nd. On the 22nd, Wang Jingjiu, commander of the Second Corps of the Field Army directly under Chiang Kai-shek's Army Headquarters, with the 58th Division and the 199th Brigade of the 66th Division, advanced northward from Jinxiang under the cover of airplanes and tanks, attempting to relieve the siege of Yangshanji. The People's Liberation Army, disregarding the heavy rain and mud, bravely launched an attack. After two hours of fierce fighting, the entire 199th Brigade was annihilated, and the entire 38th Regiment of the 13th Brigade of the 66th Division, which came out of Yangshanji to harass, and part of the 58th Division were also annihilated. According to known battle results: more than 6,000 Chiang's officers and soldiers were killed or captured. Wang Renqiao, commander of the 199th Brigade, and Zheng Wenyan, commander of the 38th Regiment of the 13th Brigade, and Wang Louxun, deputy commander of the regiment, were all captured alive. Two tanks were also captured. Detailed battle results are being verified. The 199th Brigade was mostly annihilated by the People's Liberation Army in northern Henan in April, and then transferred south of the Yellow River for replenishment. This time, after replenishment, it was completely annihilated by the People's Liberation Army again.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jilu Yu, 24th -- Li Mingya, Deputy Division Commander of Chiang's 55th Division, who fled from Qiucheng Yuecheng, didn't have time to change into plain clothes. Wearing a grass-green woolen military uniform, he ran fifty or sixty miles overnight. When he arrived near Shatuji, northeast of Juye City, because it was dark and he was unfamiliar with the geography, he was exhausted, hungry, and thirsty, and he couldn't run any further. So he had to bite the bullet and go to the village to find something to eat before leaving. He staggered towards the edge of the village. "Hey! Stop! Who are you?" Militia member Liu Zhenhuan shouted, raising a grenade. "Hand over your gun, or I'll shoot you!" Unexpectedly, this tall officer with a shaved head and wearing a green woolen military uniform knelt down with a thud. He raised his hands and pleaded repeatedly, "Spare me, spare me." Liu Zhenhuan strode forward and immediately found a brand-new pistol and one hundred bullets from his waist. Liu Zhenhuan said happily, "Get up! The Eighth Route Army treats prisoners well." So he sent Li Mingya to the district office, and the district office transferred him to the Juye County Government. When Li Mingya saw County Magistrate Wang, he hurriedly took out a business card from his sleeve and respectfully said to County Magistrate Wang, "Please take care of me, I am Li Mingya."

　　我军冒雨阻击金乡以北
  　续歼王敬久部六千
  　敌一九九旅及另一个团全部覆灭
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线二十四日电】刘伯承将军所部，二十二日在金乡以北地区，再歼蒋军一个旅又一个团。二十二日蒋记陆军总部直辖野战第二兵团司令王敬久以五十八师及六十六师之一九九旅，在飞机坦克掩护下，由金乡向北挺进，图解羊山集之围，解放军不顾大雨泥泞，奋勇出击，经两小时激战，将一九九旅全部歼灭，并歼灭由羊山集出扰之六十六师十三旅三十八团全部，及五十八师一部。据已知战果：毙俘蒋军官兵六千余人，一九九旅旅长王任翘及十三旅三十八团团长郑文愿，团副王楼训等均被生俘，并缴获坦克两辆，详细战果正清查中。按一九九旅于四月间在豫北为解放军歼灭大半后，即调黄河以南补充，此次经补充后，复为人民解放军全部歼灭。
    【新华社冀鲁豫二十四日电】从邱城越城逃跑的蒋军五十五师副师长理明亚，来不及换上便衣，穿着一身草绿色的呢子军服，一夜跑了五六十里，到了钜野城东北的沙土集附近，因为天色昏黑，地理不熟，已跑得他四肢无力又饥又渴，实在不能再往前跑了。于是只好硬着头皮到村里找点东西吃再走，他一歪一扭的向村边走来。“喂！站住！干什么的？”联防队员刘振缓高举着手榴弹叫道：“快缴枪，不然打死你！”不想这位光着头穿着绿色呢军服的高个子军官竟扑通跪了下来，他两手高举起，哀求连声的叫喊：“饶命，饶命。”刘振缓大步走上前去，一下从他的腰里搜出了一枝崭新的小手枪和一百粒子弹，刘振缓高兴的说：“起来吧！八路军是优待俘虏的，于是把理明亚送到区公所，区公所又转送到了钜野县政府，当理明亚一见王县长，急忙从衣袖里掏出一张名片，恭恭敬敬的向王县长说：“劳驾照顾点，我就是理明亚。”
