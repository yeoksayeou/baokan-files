　　The long, long line had already climbed to the top of the mountain, and Hou Tongyun, carrying two guns, and his platoon followed the main force to the summit.
　　Such cold weather, such a difficult road! Some comrades were completely "flying," sliding from the ice down to the foot of the mountain. Some comrades' hands and feet were so numb with cold that they didn't even wipe the snot from their lips. Some of the older comrades' beards had turned white. Some comrades were so cold that they couldn't hold on any longer, so they squatted down to make a fire halfway up the mountain, but as soon as they warmed up a bit, their ears cracked, their fingers broke…!
　　There was a soldier from the Second Company squatting under a wisteria tree about twenty feet ahead.
　　"Who is that?" Hou Tongyun wondered. He quickly walked over to take a look, and it turned out to be Yang Jinzhong.
　　Yang Jinzhong could no longer walk. He was already sick when he set out, and with the cold, he couldn't take another step. His hands were so swollen with cold that he couldn't fit them into his gloves, his feet were so swollen that he dared not touch the ground, and he was shivering all over…!
　　"What to do?" — Persuasion didn't work, and Hou Tongyun was very anxious. He quickly and gently grabbed Yang Jinzhong's swollen hand. Oh! It felt like grabbing a piece of ice. Hou Tongyun used both of his hands to clasp Yang Jinzhong's hands, trying to transfer the warmth from his own hands to Yang Jinzhong's. Suddenly, he started to cry. At that moment, he remembered when he was a child, begging for food with his mother, and how he had been frozen half to death in a small temple during the coldest days of winter. Who had shown any pity then? But, "Yang Jinzhong is my comrade! I should love him! If he is cold, I am cold too."
　　Hou Tongyun turned his head to cry, but Yang Jinzhong saw him. Yang Jinzhong asked strangely, "Why are you sad, Deputy Platoon Leader?"
　　"Ah! It's nothing, I'm not sad—no, it's just the wind making me cry!" Hou Tongyun stammered, forcing a smile. At this time, he felt that Yang Jinzhong's hands were a little warmer.
　　Comrades from the Second, Third, and Fourth Companies… flashed past one by one. In the end, only the two of them were left.
　　Hou Tongyun bit his teeth, and the tears receded. He gently stroked Yang Jinzhong's hand and said to Yang Jinzhong:
　　"Jinzhong, I'll stay with you. Let's rest for a while, and then we'll go. — Do you need to relieve yourself?"
　　Yang Jinzhong shook his head, his eyes fixed on Hou Tongyun. He felt as if his eyes were hot, and his nose was sour. He couldn't speak. He looked at Hou Tongyun—his relative—and couldn't help but think of when he first joined the army, how Deputy Platoon Leader Hou Tongyun had borrowed bowls and chopsticks for him, brought him water, and prepared his meals. He even took care of him while he slept, checking even late at night to see if his quilt was tucked in properly. When he was sick, he busied himself catching lice, ironing his clothes, bringing water, making meals, wiping his behind, and emptying his chamber pot… and more. When Sun Sanbao was sick and couldn't lie down, but could only sit up leaning, he had to use his own body as Sun Sanbao's backrest, watching over him for three whole nights without closing his eyes. When Sun Sanbao was delirious with illness, no matter when he woke up, he would call out "Jia (the way people from Fushan call mother)—", and the Deputy Platoon Leader would always be there to answer him! "Sanbao, I'm here with you! What do you need?…"
　　The wind howled, and the branches and weeds rustled.
　　Hou Tongyun carried Yang Jinzhong's things on his back, trying his best to let half of Yang Jinzhong's body lean into his shoulder, slowly moving his steps, and helping Yang Jinzhong down to the foot of the mountain.
　　As soon as they arrived at the campsite, Hou Tongyun sent Yang Jinzhong back to his squad. He immediately pulled out a pair of "brand new cotton shoes" that he had been reluctant to wear from his backpack, grabbed Yang Jinzhong's hand, and stuffed the cotton shoes into Yang Jinzhong's arms.
　　"Jinzhong, wear these cotton shoes! Wait a moment, and I'll warm your hands. Don't dare to warm up too much near the fire!"
　　When Yang Jinzhong accepted the cotton shoes, he kept staring at Hou Tongyun. He couldn't say anything, he didn't know if his mind was confused, or if his eyes were blurry, but he saw that the person standing in front of him was not the Deputy Platoon Leader, but his mother.
　　Hou Tongyun stood in front of Yang Jinzhong, waiting for Yang Jinzhong, afraid that he still wanted to say something. But Yang Jinzhong didn't say anything. Hou Tongyun said a few words to the other comrades, then closed the door and left.

　　排长，妈妈
    ——侯同云爱兵故事
    陈光兴
    老长老长的队伍已经爬上山顶了，侯同云扛着两支枪和他们的排跟着大部队也爬上了山顶。
    这样冷的天气，这样难走的路啊，有的同志是完全“坐飞机”，从冰块上滑到山脚下去的，有的同志冻得手脚麻木了，鼻涕淌在嘴唇上也不揩掉，年纪大一些的同志，胡须也白了。有的同志冻得实在无法支持，便蹲在山半腰烤起火来，可是刚刚烤了一会，耳朵破了，手指断了……。
    二连有一个战士，在前面两丈多远的一颗藤条树下蹲下来了。
    “那是谁呢？”侯同云心里想。他连忙走前来一看，原来是杨金中。
    杨金中再也不能走了，临出发时他就有病，再加上这样冷，他一步也走不动，他的手冻肿得插不进手套，脚肿得不敢挨地皮，浑身在打哆嗦……！
    “这怎么办呢？”——劝说了一套也不顶事，侯同云心里很是着急。他急速的，轻轻的抓住了杨金中的肿手，呀！象抓住了一块冰。侯同云用他的两只手夹住杨金中的两只手，他想把自己手上的热气传到杨金中的手上去。忽然他自己流泪了。这时他想起了他自己小时跟着母亲讨饭时，三九天气住在小庙里冻得死去活来的光景，有谁怜悯呢？可是，“杨金中是我的同志呵，我应当疼爱他呵！他冷，也是我冷。”
    侯同云扭过头去流泪，被杨金中看见了。杨金中奇怪的问：“为啥伤心呀，副排长？”
    “唉！没有啥，我没有伤心，——不，是风吹的我流泪了呀！”侯同云支吾的强笑着说。这时候他觉得杨金中的手有点温热了。
    二连、三连、四连。…的同志们一个一个从面前闪过。最后，只剩下他们两个人了。
    侯同云把牙齿一咬，眼泪退回去了。他轻轻的抚摸着杨金中的手。对杨金中说：
    “金中，我陪着你，咱们再稍歇一会，就走吧。——你要小便吗？”
    杨金中摇了摇头，眼珠不动的盯住侯同云。他感到眼眶好象一阵热，鼻子里好象一股酸，他说不出话来。他望着侯同云——他的亲人，不由得他想起了当他才入伍的时候，副排长侯同云给他借碗，找筷子，端水，弄饭，就连睡觉也关照到，哪怕是深夜，他还要摸一摸被子盖掩了没有。病了的时候，他忙着抓虱子，烫衣，端水做饭，擦屎，倒尿盔………还有。孙三宝病了不能躺下，只能斜卧的坐着，他就一直得用自己的身子，当做孙三保的靠背，整整的守了三夜没有合眼。孙三保病得糊涂了，不论什么时候醒过来，叫喊“家（浮山人叫妈的称呼）——”，副排长便什么时候也在他跟前答应着！“三宝，我在你跟前呀！你要什么呢？………。”
    狂风吹着，树枝野草“哗哗”的响着。
    侯同云把杨金中的东西背上，尽量让杨金中的半个身子倒在自己的肩窝里，慢慢的移动着步子，扶着杨金中下到山脚下了。
    刚一到宿营地，侯同云把杨金中送回了班，他马上从自己的背包里扯出一双他一直不舍得穿的“崭新的棉鞋”，一手抓住了杨金中的手，一手把棉鞋塞在杨金中的怀里。
    “金中，这双棉鞋你穿了吧！等一等我再来给你暖手，不敢多烤呀！”
    杨金中在接着这双棉鞋的时候，他又一直用眼睛盯住侯同云。他一直说不出话来，不知道是他心里乱了，还是眼睛花了，他看见站在他面前的，不是副排长，好象是他的妈妈。
    侯同云站在杨金中面前，等着杨金中，怕他还要说什么。而杨金中却又没有说出什么话来。侯同云和其他同志说了两句话，就带上了门走了。
