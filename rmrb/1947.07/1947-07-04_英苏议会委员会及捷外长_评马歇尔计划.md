Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: TASS, London, 28th: The Anglo-Soviet Parliamentary Committee welcomes the Soviet government's decision to participate in the Paris Conference to discuss the Marshall Plan. Its communique stated: "We warmly welcome the Marshall Plan, but we must wait and see if there are ulterior motives. The Truman Doctrine has not been abandoned; it is being applied to Greece, Turkey, and Iran. When the Hungarian government reorganized to exclude disloyal reactionaries, the US government decided to halt the credit to Hungary based on the surplus goods agreement concluded in February. In China and Italy, American policy remains the same, and this time Marshall has not even indirectly hinted that his proposal breaks with the Truman Doctrine in any form or shape."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: Prague dispatch: Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Masaryk spoke at a conference held by the International Liaison Consolidation Association on the 28th, discussing the Marshall Plan. He said: We welcome this plan, but it should be for the whole of Europe. If this plan intends to divide Europe into two camps, right-wing and left-wing, then we will certainly resist it.

　　英苏议会委员会及捷外长
  　评马歇尔计划
    【新华社陕北三十日电】塔斯社伦敦二十八日电：苏英议会委员会欢迎苏政府决定参加巴黎会议讨论马歇尔计划。其公报称：“我们热烈欢迎马歇尔计划之前，必须等一等，看是否有弦外之音。杜鲁门主义现在并未被弃绝，它正运用于希、土、及伊朗，而且当匈牙利政府刚一重组政府，以排除不忠的反动分子时，美国政府即决定停止根据今年二月所订剩余物资协定中尚须贷与匈国的信用贷款。在中国与意大利，美国的政策也仍是一样，而且这一次马歇尔也丝毫没有甚至间接暗示一下其建议是与杜鲁门主义在任何形式或形态上相决裂的。”　【新华社陕北二十九日电】布拉格讯：捷外长马萨里克于二十八日在国际联系巩固协会所举行的大会上演说，论及马歇尔计划时他说：我们欢迎这一计划，但它应该是为着整个欧洲的。如果这一计划意在分裂欧洲成为右翼和左翼两个阵营，那么我们一定抗拒它。
