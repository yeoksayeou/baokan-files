　　Snippets from the Jiang Area
　　◇ During the Jiang army's occupation of Andong, there was a severe famine. The county had over 300,000 people, with over 133,000 starving. Cries were everywhere, parents sold their children, and entire families committed suicide by poison. In the first and middle ten days of May, 46 people committed suicide, and dozens died of starvation every day.
　　◇ In Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province, rickshaw pullers went on strike in mid-April because the government forbade them from waiting for fares within the city. They parked all their rickshaws in the county government square to petition. They placed a portrait of Sun Yat-sen and the national flag in one rickshaw as a guide, and each person held small flags with slogans such as "We want to eat" and "Struggle for life."
