　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. Comprehensive report: The Soviet Union's post-war industrial construction is rapidly recovering and developing. There are new achievements in factories, electricity, and technology, and hundreds of heavy industries are under construction nationwide. Restoration work in the south is accelerating, and the giant Zaporozhstal iron and steel plant is about to start operations, while the restoration of the Makeyevka Steel Plant is progressing extremely quickly. Other construction plans, such as the Kuys Automotive Factory, the Transcaucasian Hardware Factory, and the Minsk Tractor Factory, will also be launched. With new construction techniques and mechanized equipment, the Chelyabinsk Steel Pipe Plant built a large Siemens-Martin furnace in eight months, and a blast furnace was built in seven months at the Zhuskaya factory. Soviet factories are increasing the production of machine tools such as excavators, cranes, handling machines, and road construction machines. The European part of the Soviet Union is the first to apply new automatic machine tools and lathe transportation systems. Many open-hearth furnaces will be equipped with automatic controls this year. In terms of electricity supply, Kuibyshev and Saratov are implementing city-wide electrification plans. Hundreds of collective farms in Leningrad have established thermal and hydroelectric power stations, the countryside of Sverdlovsk has been completely electrified, and many Soviet factory departments are producing electrical equipment for rural power stations. Power stations in Smolensk, Kursk, Kaluga, and Pskov, among other cities, resumed operations last year. Power stations and electricity supply networks are also being expanded elsewhere. Preparations for the construction of the Mingechaur Hydroelectric Power Station on the Kura River in Transcaucasia, one of the largest hydroelectric projects in the Soviet Union, have been completed.
