　　An Old Hero's Determination
　　Zeng Ke
　　The old hero, Que Fuchen, jumped onto the stage with spirited energy. When his loud voice issued the first greeting to the heroes and model workers below the stage, everyone felt particularly close to him. Immediately, attention was focused on him, listening to his moving self-narration:
　　"Comrades, I only joined the army in the first month of this year. Don't look at my face full of beard and my old age; compared to you all, I am still a new recruit. My family was originally a very poor household, with no room or land for generations. Since our Eighth Route Army liberated our Quzhou County, the peasants have been completely turned over. I was allocated seventeen mu of land and three rooms, with food, clothing, and shelter. It was truly like ascending from hell to heaven. Then everyone will ask me, since you have a good life, why don't you stay at home and live it well? Why come out to be a soldier? Comrades, 'It's hard to forget the well-digger when drinking water.' I joined the army to repay the kindness of our Communist Party!"
　　"Welcome our old hero!" A warm cheer rose from below the stage.
　　Que Fuchen spread out his arms, calming down the thunderous applause, and said with a smile:
　　"I am very happy that you welcome me now! When I first proposed joining the army in the village, I was very unpopular. Everyone who saw me laughed and said: 'At such an old age, who still wants you!' I always brazenly retorted: 'Forty-three, it's just the right time to work! What's old? I don't know how many times I asked the village head, and he sent me back every time, but my heart never died.'" He patted his chest and said, "In the first month of this year, there were many people enlisting, and I made up my mind that I had to go this time no matter what. I went to the village head to register again, thinking, if he doesn't let me go, I'll give up my old life and definitely make a scene with them in the county. I secretly rallied seven or eight young men who had already registered. I encouraged them and said: 'If they don't let me go, none of you should go!' They all said: 'Okay! We will definitely recommend you!' After making such a fuss, I passed one hurdle. When I arrived at the county for inspection, there were more than seven hundred people, and they immediately picked me out first! I felt really bad! I knew the director of the county Armed Forces Committee. At this time, I was so anxious that I had no choice but to grab him and reason with him. I said: 'Let me tell you! I have made up my mind to become a soldier of the Eighth Route Army. You say I'm old and can't walk, you can call out the strongest young man on the spot to compete with me. If I fall behind one step, send me back immediately, and I won't say anything.' After such a persistent plea, I got through."
　　The audience laughed happily for him, but he frowned and continued:
　　"On the way to the team, I was so worried that I couldn't even eat, fearing that I would be rejected again. When we arrived in Fan County, twenty-six of us arrived at the Third Company of the First Battalion of the 21st Regiment. Twenty-five people were assigned to their squads one by one, and I was left alone again. Comrades, you see how disappointing that was! The company commander and instructor looked me up and down several times and said to me: 'You are so old, it might not work for you in the company; go to the kitchen!' As soon as I heard that, I got angry. I thought, this is the last hurdle anyway. People often say, 'No fight, no acquaintance'; if I don't argue a little, I really won't be able to achieve my determination. I said: 'Report to the company commander, I won't go to the kitchen. Ask me, I wouldn't even want to be a clerk, it's not that I can't write. I am determined to carry a gun!' The company commander saw that I had a lot of energy and asked: 'Can you handle the marching and drills?' In my anxiety, I said to the company commander: 'To tell you the truth, I also worked as a soldier in the old society for two years. You pick out a few of the strongest ones, and I guarantee that on the field, I won't fall behind them in the parallel bars and the pommel horse. Now I only ask to be a new recruit!' The company commander and instructor laughed when they heard that. They said: 'This old fellow might be useful!' With that one sentence, I became a soldier and became a fighter of our Eighth Route Army! I was so happy I didn't know what to do. After working in the squad for ten days, I was promoted to squad leader, and my energy increased even more. Comrades, think about it, I wasn't even qualified to be a soldier at first, but now the superiors want me to lead a squad of people. Ha! When marching, I carry the belongings of two or three people on my back, and the young people can't even keep up with me! I ask the superiors every day to assign us to carry out assaults. I often say, no matter what a person does, as long as he makes up his mind and is determined, he can definitely achieve his goal!'"
　　Applause and cheers rose like a tide again in the entire field:
　　"Learn from the old hero's indomitable spirit!"
　　Que Fuchen, without bothering to wipe the sweat from his forehead, said again:
　　"Let's all learn from the hero Li Zhiwu! Compared to his glorious deeds of killing the enemy, my hero title is not worthy. Every time I see the hero medal and red flower hanging on my chest, I feel ashamed. This time, even if I have no achievements, I will make meritorious contributions in the counter-offensive. I have been in the old army for almost ten years, and I have learned some skills. When fighting, I can still distinguish how the bullets come and go, and I dare to rush forward. This time, when attacking Daxiaohuying, I led a squad to the enemy's blockhouse, discovered them, dispersed and concealed the brothers, and ran back to the battalion commander to get in touch, without suffering any losses. That is also based on this old experience." Speaking here, his emotions became even more excited. He raised his sleeves and clenched his fists and said: "Comrades, I have an old mother in my family who is over seventy years old. When I came out this time, I was afraid she would be sad. Guess what she said? She understands now! She said: 'In the twelfth year of the Republic of China, our mother and son fled the famine. If we hadn't gotten something to eat, your wife would have left you. It was her hanging money that we used, and we didn't even get three days of rice soup. There was no way, you dropped your old mother to become a soldier, and I didn't say a word even though I shed a few tears. Now, we have everything we need at home. The grain harvested this year, besides paying public grain, there are more than six dan stored there. My old woman can't finish eating, so what's the point of tying you to the house? Waiting for the stubborn army to come over and turn the good world upside down again?' Comrades, what else do you think I have to worry about? When I was about to leave, it was almost the lunar New Year. I dyed the twelve-foot-long white cloth that the villagers supported us in joining the army, weighed two catties of cotton, and made a new cotton-padded coat for her. I also privately told the village chief: 'My mother is too old. I want to explain it clearly to you. Old people always have to die. If there comes a day when she can't breathe and falls, don't notify me. Just get a coffin and bury her. I will definitely not come back until I defeat Chiang Kai-shek.' The village chief agreed to everything and arranged my mother's life well. After the battle of Dahu Camp, the village received our meritorious service report, and there was even a joke! My mother wrote a letter saying that Qizhen in the Third District and Xiaoxinzhai in the Fourth District were fighting over me. The matter is like this. In the twenty-eighth year, my mother fled the famine and still had nothing to eat, so she lived in my grandmother's house in Qizhen. She didn't return to Xiaoxinzhai until after the liberation. Now, Xiaoxinzhai sent people to pick up my mother and said: 'Go back, and you can pick seventeen mu of top-quality land and three large buildings.' The commendation list for the heroes' meeting has already been sent back to Xiaoxinzhai. The district chief of the Fourth District said long ago that he would give my mother a plaque, and it must be jointly celebrated with Qizhen! The two villages are only five miles away. . . . "
　　His words were interrupted again by fierce slogans:
　　"Meritorious service is truly glorious!"
　　"After opening the Heroes' Meeting, we will launch a major counter-offensive. Comrades, I am here to challenge you young people." His eyes turned red, and he jumped to the edge of the stage in one step and swore: "This time, don't give me provisions. If I'm hungry, I will grab Chiang Kai-shek and eat his flesh. If I'm thirsty, I will drink Chiang Kai-shek's blood! I have suffered too much from the son of a bitch, this is my ambition and determination, and this is the plan I have made. Asking me to be peaceful with Chiang Kai-shek, there's no way in hell, I must destroy his person, his horse, and his gun!"
　　The old hero jumped high! The slogans shouted by the people under the stage were even higher! The emotions of this last day of the Heroes' Meeting were also further heightened by the old hero's speech.

　　一个老英雄的决心
    曾克
    老英雄阙富臣精神勃勃的跳上台来，当他宏亮的嗓音，向台下英雄模范们发出第一声召呼的时候，大家感觉得特别的亲热。于是，注意力立刻集中了他，听他的动人的自述：
    “同志们，我是今年正月间才参军的。你们别看我满脸胡子槎槎的这大年纪，比起诸位来，可还是个新兵。俺家原是个赤贫户，祖祖辈辈一间房一亩地都没有。自搭咱八路军解放了俺曲周县，农民大翻身，俺才分了十七亩地三间房子，有吃有穿有住，真好比从地狱上了天堂。那大家就要问我啦，有了好日子你不在家好生过，出来当兵干啥呢？同志“吃水难忘掏井人”，我参军就是报咱共产党的恩情呵！”
    “欢迎我们的老英雄！”台下热烈的欢呼了。
    阙富臣伸开两只臂膀，按抚下去雷样的掌声，笑着说：
    “这会儿你们欢迎我，我这心可算高兴啦！我在村上才提出要参军的时候，可是大大不受欢迎。谁看见谁笑话说：这么大岁数，谁还要你！我总是厚着脸皮顶他们：四十三，正干的时候吆！老啥？跟村长不知道要求过多少次，都叫他碰回来，心可一直没有死。”他拍了拍胸脯子又说：“今年正月间，参军的人数很多，我拿定了主意，这会无论咋着也得去。又去找村长上名，心里想，不叫去，我这条老命也就不要了，一定要跟他们往县里闹。我私下又活动了七八个已经上名了的小伙子，我鼓着他们说：要是不叫我去，你们大家可都不要去！他们都说：行！俺们一定把你给鳔上去！这么闹了一通，算是过了一个关口。到了县上检验，七百多人，一下可就先把我给挑出来啦！心里可真不好受呀！县武委会主任我原就认识他，这时候，急的没办法，我就抓住他说理。我说：对你们说吧！我当八路军的决心是下定了，你说我老了，走不动，你当场叫出最能走的小伙子，来跟我比比，我要是掉队一步，就马上打发我回去，我没二话说。这么一赖又赖上去了。”
    听众们都替他高兴的笑起来，他却皱起了眉头继续说：
    “往队伍补的路上，耽心的饭都吃不下去，只怕再被打下来。到了范县，俺们一齐二十六个人到了廿一团一营三连来，二十五个人一个一个都分配下班了，眼看着又剩下我一个。同志们，你们看该有多损！连长指导员从上到下看了我好几遍，对我说：你这么大岁数，到连队怕不中，下伙房去吧！我一听就起了火，我想，反正这是最后一关啦，人常说不打不相识，不扯扯筋可就真没指望达到决心啦，我说：报告连长，伙房我是不去。你问问，叫我去当文书我都不干，我又不是不会写。我是决心要扛枪！连长看我劲头不小就问：行军出操你能顶下来吗？我心一急，就对连长说：不瞒连长，我在旧社会还干过两年行伍，你把你们体力最强的挑上几个来，保险野外操场，杠子木马我还落不了他们后边。现在我只求当个新兵呵！连长和指导员一听都笑了，他们说：这老家伙管许中呵！就他们这一句话，我算当上了兵，成了咱八路军的战士！高兴的真不知道该咋着好。在班上干了十天，就提升成班长，劲头更大了。同志们，你们想想，原先是连兵格都不够，这会，上级叫带上一班人。喝！行起军来，我背上两三个人的东西，年轻人也走不过我！天天请求上级，摊上我们去打突击。我常说，一个人无论干啥？只要立下志向下定决心，一定可以达到目的！……”
    掌声欢呼声浪潮一般的又在全场掀起了：
    “学习老英雄不屈不挠的精神！”
    阙富臣没有顾得去擦那满额的汗，又说：
    “咱们大伙都向李治五英雄学习吧！比起他的杀敌光荣事迹，我这个英雄名义是不配的。我一看见胸前挂的英雄奖章和红花，就觉得抱愧。这回，我就算没有任何成绩吧！反攻中好好来立功。我在旧军队里前后混过差不多有十好几年，多少还学习过一些本事，打起仗来还分得清子弹咋来咋去的，敢往上冲。这回打大小胡营，我带着一班人摸到敌人的炮楼子跟前，发现了他们，把弟兄们疏散隐蔽好，又跑回去向营长取联络，没有受一点损失，也就是凭这点老经验。”说到这里，他的情绪更加激动了。他撂了撂袖子，攒起拳头说：“同志们，我家里就有一个七十多岁的老娘，我这回出来，生怕她难过，你猜她咋说？她可算明白啦！她说：民国十二年咱娘俩逃荒，要不上吃的，眼看着媳妇子跟你散开，使她的吊把钱，没喝上三天米汤。没办法，你摔下老娘去当兵，我掉上几滴眼泪都没说二话。现下，家里要啥有啥，今年打的粮食，除交公粮，还有六石多囤在那，我老婆子眉里眼里吃也吃不完，把你拴到家里干啥？等着顽固军过来再把好世道翻过去？同志们，你们想，我还有啥挂头呢？临出来的时候，快过阴历年，我把村上拥护我们参军的一丈二尺白布染了染，秤了二斤花，给他老人家套了身新棉衣。又私下交待村长说：我娘年纪太老了，我想把话给你说明白，人老总有一死，有那么一天，她要是一口气上不来倒了，你不要通知我，弄个棺材把她入土就算了，我是非把老蒋打垮不回来。村长啥事情都应承了，他把俺娘的生活给安排得好好的。打过大胡营，村上接到咱们的立功喜报，还出了个笑话呢！俺娘来信说三区启镇和四区小心寨两下争我这一个人。事情是这么着的，二十八年，俺娘逃荒回来，还是没啥吃，就寄往在启镇外婆家，一直没有回小心寨，翻身也是在启镇翻的。现下，小心寨派人去接我娘回去说：你回去，尽你检十七亩上等好地，三间大楼房。这回群英会的报功单已经送回小心寨了，四区区长早就说要给俺娘挂匾，一定和启镇合起来红火呢！两村才离五里地。……”
    他的话又被狂烈的口号声截断了：
    “立功真光荣！”
    “开了群英会，咱们就要大反攻，同志们，我来和你们青年人提出挑战。”他的眼睛发了红，一个箭步跳到台口上，发起誓来：“这次出发，不要发给我给养，饿了我要抓住蒋介石吃他的肉，渴了我要喝蒋介石的血！我吃狗肏的亏太多了，这就是我的志向和决心，也就是我订的计划。叫我跟蒋介石平和点，屌门也没有，非要把他的一人一马一枪?坏?枷?鸶删徊桓市荩　?
    老英雄一蹦多高！台下的口号声喊得更高！这最后一天的英雄会的情绪，被老英雄的发言，激励得也越发高涨了。
