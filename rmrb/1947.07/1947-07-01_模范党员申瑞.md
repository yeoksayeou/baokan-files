　　Model Party Member Shen Rui
    Xing Chongzhi
  　I. Fighting Against the Old Society
    Comrade Shen Rui is the village head of Shentou Village. He was born into a poor peasant family and has always hated the landlord class. Before the Eighth Route Army arrived in 1938, the landlord cadres, under the pretext of organizing a self-defense force to maintain their ruling position, ate and drank lavishly every day. Comrade Shen Rui couldn't stand it, so he began to mobilize the young people he was with to rise up in opposition. At the time, he used the fact that the landlord cadres' children were exempt from the self-defense force as a reason to fight against corruption and waste. Many people participated at the beginning, but later the landlords threatened severely, scolding them for "rebelling," and some people compromised, leaving only Shen Rui and seven others. Failing in the village, they went to the district to reason, but they knew that all crows are black, and the district chief was also in league with the landlords, uttering from his dog mouth:
    Your actions are rebellious, how can this be allowed! But because they insisted on reasoning, the district chief was left speechless, and in the end, he pushed them away, telling them to resolve it in the village, while secretly instructing the landlord cadres in the village: punish them when you get home. This struggle failed. Comrade Shen Rui was fined six silver dollars by the unreasonable landlords, which deepened his dissatisfaction with the old society.
    II. Joining the Communist Party
    After the Eighth Route Army arrived in 1939, it organized farmers' associations. Comrade Shen Rui was the first to join the farmers' association, serving as a member of the standing committee. In 1940, the burden was estimated and assigned. The village head at the time, Liu ××, took the upper-class route, with an incorrect stance, advocating equal distribution. Comrade Shen Rui was very dissatisfied, so he united a group of poor people who dared to fight and launched a campaign to offer opinions. Every time they read out the grades, it was always rejected. At that time, the reason for the struggle was that the big households paid too little, and the small households paid more than them, which was illegal. This left Liu ×× with no choice. He read it three times in a row, and each time he was turned back by Comrade Shen Rui and his group. In the end, they had to revise it, re-reduce the burden, reduce the burden on the small households, and increase the burden on the big households. This struggle was a victory, gaining the support of the basic masses.
    In 1941, when the village election was held, the basic masses agreed that Comrade Shen Rui should be the village head, but because our work had not yet gained a large advantage at that time, the reactionary forces still controlled a portion of the masses. They promoted the idea that "If we let Xiao Fusheng (Shen Rui's childhood name) be the village head, he's so resolute, we common people won't be able to live!" In this way, the masses fell into their trap. As a result of the election, Comrade Shen Rui got the third highest number of votes and became the finance director. It happened to be wartime at the time, and the village head Liu ×× turned coward and ran away, handing over the procedures to Comrade Shen Rui. During the war, Liu ×× even discussed with Shen Rui about maintaining the enemy, but Shen Rui resolutely stopped him. After the war, Liu ×× was sent to the government and dismissed for wartime desertion. Only then did Comrade Shen Rui take over as village head, leading the masses in various struggles against the landlords. In 1942, with the progress of his work, he joined the Communist Party of China and became a glorious Communist Party member.
    III. An Excellent Chief of Staff
    After becoming the village head and receiving Party training, he was determined to work hard for the Party and the masses. First, he carried out anti-corruption and anti-maintenance. At first, the five people who were corrupt all gave false accounts, and the problems could not be found out. Comrade Shen Rui then held individual talks, carrying out division work, and then convened a mass meeting to call on them to confess. At that time, on the stage, they pushed each other, biting each other open, and that's how the problem was clarified. Then, after carrying out the anti-maintenance campaign, because the religious organization in the village at that time had become a backward sectarian group, he first launched a voluntary registration confession, convened a meeting, and first asked an important person to talk about it. Below were more than eighty households, all of whom voluntarily admitted their mistakes and expressed their determination to withdraw from the religion.
    Comrade Shen Rui always has a way in any situation and is very good at upholding the truth and conducting struggles. During the rent reduction campaign in 1944, the landlord Guo Xianlin buried Shen Hechang's belongings. When he was asked to reply, he said that no one spoke up, and the meeting showed that there was nothing to say, and the landlord had the upper hand. In this situation, Comrade Shen Rui immediately stood up and used very correct and appropriate words to confront the landlord, and the landlord lowered his head to the peasants.
    In the land reform movement, Comrade Shen Rui was able to use tactics in the struggle against the landlords. Hitting the key points and influencing the general situation was his strategic policy. When asking the landlords for things, the landlords were cunning and refused to give them, and other cadres advocated beating them up, regardless of the severity. Comrade Shen Rui advocated focusing on the key points, concentrating the landlords together. Guo Xianlin was the first to take out fifty silver dollars, influencing a landlord's wife to also take out ten silver dollars. This way, the scope of the attack was not wide, and things could be obtained. When doing this, Comrade Shen Rui stood aside to observe the mood of the masses and the situation at the time, and immediately gave instructions on the direction, so the cadres called him an excellent chief of staff.
    IV. A Solution for Everything
    Comrade Shen Rui is very appropriate in solving any problem, and both sides are happy whether they are right or wrong. Even if there is an individual deviation, it can be resolved immediately, so Shentou Village rarely goes to the district to solve problems. When solving the family problem of Shen Zihe, because Shen Zihe's stepmother took something that the previous daughter-in-law had given to her daughter, after Comrade Shen Rui's careful investigation and visit, he clarified the problem and called both parties to the village office to solve it. First, he secretly mobilized her daughter to compromise in order to strengthen the relationship with her stepmother in the future; then he mobilized her stepmother to apologize to her daughter and let it go. When the two met, the village head said that these things were stolen by you, you shouldn't blame others, and according to your mistake, you will be fined ten catties of oil. Her daughter then said from the side: "The problem is that she's wrong to blame others. It doesn't matter if she takes some of my things. Let's just fine her two catties of oil and let it go. I'll never complain." The matter was resolved in this way, and everyone was happy. From then on, the relationship between her stepmother and daughter also improved.
    In every conscription, other cadres went down to mobilize, and some people couldn't be persuaded. Once this "Zhuge Liang" Shen Rui spoke, they were persuaded. Last year, when mobilizing Feng Zongting, he argued with other cadres, and they couldn't do anything. After analyzing the situation, Comrade Shen Rui judged that the young man basically wanted to join the army, but was afraid that his father wouldn't let him go. So he went to mobilize his father, saying: "Since the Eighth Route Army came, have you ever borrowed grain? In the past few years, you have turned over and are no longer oppressed by the landlords. Now, in order to defend the good times after the turn-over, you should mobilize Zongting to join the Eighth Route Army to defend our fruits." Zongting's father said: "It's okay for me to mobilize him to join the army, but I'm afraid my son will say that I'm chasing him away." After Comrade Shen Rui explained it to him, his father went to mobilize his son. So Zongting happily signed up. At the welcoming conscription meeting, he swore to all the villagers that he would not return home until he had eliminated the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, and instructed everyone to work hard in the rear.
    V. "The Village Head Doesn't Run the Anti-Contribution's Home"
    Comrade Shen Rui is the village head, and the division of labor in the political system is very clear. After he himself grasped the ideas of each director, he cultivated their prestige in their work and helped them solve difficulties. The anti-contribution director is active and responsible in his work, but somewhat rough. Once, when sending grain, in order to complete the task, he sent several sick people as well. These sick people went to the anti-contribution director, but he didn't believe that they were sick and insisted that they go. These people came back and went to the village head again. Comrade Shen Rui looked at it and saw that they were really sick and couldn't go, but he didn't say anything, only saying that the anti-contribution matters should still be handled by the anti-contribution director. After saying this, Comrade Shen Rui ran from the small road to the top of the anti-contribution director's cave and told him to let those who couldn't go stay at home, otherwise it wouldn't work even if they went. In this way, when those sick people went to the anti-contribution director again, he re-examined them and found that two of them couldn't go and sent them back. Afterwards, they reflected that everyone should take care of their own business, and the village head shouldn't run the anti-contribution's home, so after that, they went to the anti-contribution director for all anti-contribution matters. The other directors of civil education, production, finance and grain can now work independently after Comrade Shen Rui's careful cultivation, and they also have prestige among the masses. Any disputes in civil education are first studied and then the director of civil education is asked to come forward to solve them.
    VI. Presenting a Gift to the Party's Birthday
    Leading the drought prevention and famine preparation work, Comrade Shen Rui still carried forward his past excellent style. When dry planting, some people couldn't understand the idea, so he himself first dry planted two mu, promoting the dry planting of sixty-one mu in the whole street. At the beginning of the drought resistance, the masses were not very energetic, so Comrade Shen Rui convened a meeting of poor and hired peasants to discuss whether to wait for rain. By calculating the family's income and expenditure, the masses' idea of waiting for the fruits of their labor was resolved, causing the drought resistance and famine preparation movement in Shentou to unfold. For example, he was able to encourage Party members to work hard, and Party members played a backbone role among the masses. As a result, the whole village saved more than 8,500 catties of rice and more than 121,600 yuan (tobacco, alcohol, and foreign goods) in twenty-five days. When harvesting wheat, in previous years, the masses ate dry rations every morning for half an hour, but this year, after the masses' research, they didn't eat dry rations, saving more than 700 catties of flour. In addition, he also led the masses to plan their families. 387 households made plans. In addition to implementing savings in his own home, he also helped a comrade save 5,000 yuan in one month. At the summary meeting, he was selected by the comrades as a special model.
    Comrade Shen Rui summarized his own achievements this time, but he was not proud. He said that although I have made some achievements, I still have many shortcomings that I need to work hard to overcome. And he made a progress plan to present a gift to the Party's birthday with practical work. His plan is to further deepen the work, personally lead the drought prevention and famine preparation production savings work, create experience to promote the whole village, strive to make meritorious service for the people, and add merit to merit.

　　模范党员申瑞
    邢崇智
  　一、和旧社会作斗争
    申瑞同志是神头村长，他出身贫农，一向仇恨地主阶级。三八年八路军还没有来，地主干部借口组织自卫队，维护自己的统治地位，每天大吃大喝。申瑞同志看不下去，就着手动员和自己一伙的青年起来反对，当时是抓住地主干部家的青年不当自卫队的事实作为理由，进行反贪污反浪费。开始参加的人很多，后来地主严厉威胁，骂他们“造反”，有些人就妥协了，只丢下申瑞等八个人。在村上不行，到区上说理，那知天下乌鸦一般黑，区长也是跟地主一气，伸出他的狗嘴说：
    你们这种行动是造反呀，这还能行！但是由于他们坚持说理，说得区长无话可说，最后就推开了，叫他们到村里解决，暗地却给村里地主干部指示：回家处罚。这次斗争失败了。申瑞同志被不讲道理的地主罚了六块现洋，这样更加深了他对旧社会的不满。
    二、参加了共产党
    三九年八路军来了后组织农会。申瑞同志首先参加农会，担任农会常委。四○年负担是估计订分，当时的村长刘××走上层，立场不正，主张均滩。申瑞同志很不满意，于是团结了一部分敢于斗争的贫苦人，发动提意见。每次他们念等级时总是通不过。当时斗争的理由是，大户出的太少，小户比他们出的多，这是不合法令的。这样使得刘××也没有一点办法，一连念了三次，每次都叫申瑞同志这伙人顶回去了。最后他们不得不修改，重新减了负担，减少了小户，加重了大户，这次斗争算是胜利了，取得了基本群众的拥护。
    四一年举行大村选时，基本群众都同意申瑞同志当村长，但因为那时咱们的工作还未占很大优势，反动势力还掌握有一部分群众，他们宣传说：“叫小福生（申瑞奶名）当上村长，他那么坚决，咱们老百姓就都不能过啦！”这样群众上了他们的圈套。选举的结果申瑞同志是第三票，当了财政主任。当时恰巧来了战争，村长刘××下了软蛋，起来跑了，把手续交给了申瑞同志。战争当中刘××还曾给申瑞商议维持敌人，被申瑞同志坚决的阻止了。战争过后按战时临阵脱逃，将刘××送到政府，撤职查办了；这样申瑞同志才担任了村长，领导群众和地主进行着各色各样的斗争。四二年随着自己工作的进步加入了中国共产党，成了光荣的共产党员。
    三、一位出色的参谋长
    当了村长，受了党的训练，下决心为党为群众努力工作。首先进行反贪污反维持。开始贪污的五个人都说的是一套假，查不出来问题。申瑞同志便个别谈话，进行分化工作，然后召开了群众大会，叫他们坦白。当时在台上你推我我推你，互相咬开了，这样才把问题搞清楚。接着在进行了反维持以后，因当时村中教门的组织，成了个落后的宗派集团，便首先发动自动报名坦白，召开了大会，先叫一个重要的谈了一下，下面有八十多户，都自动认了错，表示坚决退出教门。
    申瑞同志在任何情况中都有办法，很会坚持真理进行斗争。四四年查减时，地主郭献林埋了申和昌东西，叫他答复，他说后没有一个人说话了，会场表现着没啥说，地主占了理。申瑞同志在这种情况下，立即站立起来用很正确、恰当的话对住了地主，地主向农民低了头。
    土地改革运动中申瑞同志对地主的斗争能够运用策略，打击重点影响一般是他的战略方针。给地主要东西时，地主狡猾不给，其他干部都主张打一顿，不分轻重。申瑞同志主张有重点的搞，把地主集中到一块，郭献林第一个拿出五十块现洋，影响一个地主老婆也拿出十块现洋，这样打击面又不宽，又能搞出东西来。搞时申瑞同志自己站到一旁看群众情绪和当时情况，马上指示方针方向，所以干部都称他是一位出色的参谋长。
    四、事事有办法
    申瑞同志不管解决啥问题都很适当，双方有理没理都高兴。即是有个别偏差马上能重新解决，因此神头村去区上解决问题的很少。解决申子和的家庭问题时，因为申子和的后婆拿了前一个媳妇给闺女的东西，经过申瑞同志细心的调查访问，把问题弄清后，把双方叫到村公所解决，首先暗地动员他闺女让步，为了加强今后和后娘的关系；又动员他后娘给闺女赔个不是就算了；当二人碰了面，村长说这些东西是你偷了你不该赖别人，按你的错误罚你十斤油。她闺女在旁边接着说：“这问题就是她赖别人不对，光拿我些东西倒没啥，罚上她二斤油算了事吧，我永不说啥怨言。”这事就这样解决，都很高兴，从此她的后娘和闺女的关系也好起来了。
    在每次扩军中，其他干部都下去动员，有些人动员不通，一经这个号称“诸葛亮”的申瑞同志就说通了。去年动员冯宗亭时，他给其他干部顶嘴，都无法下手。申瑞同志分析了情况后，判定这个青年基本愿意参军，怕他父亲不叫去。他就去动员他父亲说：“自八路军来了你还借过粮？几年来你翻了身不受地主的压迫，现在为了保卫翻身后的好时光，应该动员宗亭去加入八路军，保卫咱果实。”宗亭的父亲说：“我动员他参军是可以，就是怕我儿说我往外撵他。”经申瑞同志给他解释后，他父亲便去动员他儿子。于是宗亭便很高兴的报了名。在欢迎参军会上对全村老乡宣了誓，消灭不了卖国贼蒋介石死也不回家，并嘱咐大家在后方要努力生产。
    五、“村长不当抗勤的家”
    申瑞同志是村长，政权系统分工是十分的明确。他自己掌握各主任思想后，即在工作中培养他们的威信，帮助他们的解决困难。抗勤主任在工作中积极负责，但有些粗糙。有一次派人送粮，他为了完成任务，把几个病号也派去了。这几个病号去找抗勤，他不信人家有病，坚决叫去；这几个人回来又找村长。申瑞同志看了一下真的有病，不能去，但他并没有说什么，只是说抗勤事情还是去找抗勤主任吧。说了后申瑞同志便从小道上跑到抗勤主任窑顶上给他说了一下不能去的叫他在家，不然去了也不行。这样那几个病号再去抗找勤主任时，他即重新审查了一下，有二人不能去，回去了。事后他们反映说谁的事就是谁的事，村长还不能当抗勤的家，所以以后关于抗勤的事情都去找抗勤主任了。其他民教、生产、财粮各主任经过申瑞同志的细心培养，现在都能单独工作，在群众中也有了威信，民教有啥纠纷问题都是先研究好，叫民教主任出头解决。
    六、给党的生日献礼
    领导防旱备荒工作，申瑞同志仍然是发扬了过去的优良作风。在干种地时有个别群众弄不通思想，他自己首先干种了二亩，推动全街干种了六十一亩。开始抗旱时群众劲不大，申瑞同志便召开贫雇会议，讨论是否等雨等问题，并从计算家当中解决了群众的等吃果实思想，致使神头抗旱备荒运动展开了，又如他能推动党员大家干，由党员在群众中起骨干作用，所以全村在二十五天内节约米八千五百多斤，节约钱十二万一千六百多元（烟酒洋）；割麦时往年群众每日半上午都吃干粮，今年经过群众研究不吃干粮，省面七百多斤。此外他还领导群众打算家当，三百八十七户订了计划，他除在自己家内实行节约外，并帮助一个同志在一月内省钱五千元，总结时被同志们选为特等模范。
    申瑞同志这次总结了自己的功劳，但他并不骄傲，他说我虽然有些成绩，缺点还不少，须要努力克服。并且自己订出进步计划，用实际工作给党的生日献礼。他的计划是进一步的深入工作，亲自领导防旱备荒生产节约工作，创造经验推动全村，争取为民立功，功上加功。
