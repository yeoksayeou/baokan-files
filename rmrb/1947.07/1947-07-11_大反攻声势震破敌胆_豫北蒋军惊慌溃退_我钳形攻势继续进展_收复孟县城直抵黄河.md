    【Special Dispatch from this Newspaper】Since General Liu Bocheng's army crossed the Yellow River, initiating the great counteroffensive, Chiang Kai-shek's troops on all lines in northern Henan have collapsed at the mere sound of the wind, behaving like startled birds. The dire situation faced by Chiang's troops has truly exceeded Chiang Kai-shek's expectations. As recently as the 29th of last month, Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Zhonglian were still bragging and drawing out the 32nd and 66th Divisions guarding Xinxiang, which furtively moved north from Jixian to Qixian, attempting to re-enact the ugly drama of opening the Anyang-Xinxiang section of the Pinghan Railway. However, just the day after this play began (the 30th), the news of General Liu Bocheng's army crossing the river to launch a counteroffensive struck the Chiang troops in northern Henan like a bolt from the blue, causing them to tremble across the board. Wang Zhonglian ordered the Chiang troops of the 32nd and 66th Divisions moving north, as well as the reorganized 3rd Division left to guard Xinxiang, to retreat across the Yellow River in a panic on the third day of the ugly drama's performance (July 1st). The 40th Division, besieged in Anyang, also attempted to take advantage of the situation to flee south. Its advance unit, the 106th Brigade, attacked Tangyin on July 3rd, and the 41st Division dispatched a force north to Qixian to meet the enemy, but both were intercepted by our army and fled back to their original positions in a sorry state. Thus, Wang Zhonglian's attempt to transfer the 40th Division from Anyang to Xinxiang to concentrate forces and hold one point also failed. Wang Zhonglian, the highest commander of the Chiang army in the northern Henan area, who had painstakingly invaded northern Henan for more than a year, had to flee from Xinxiang to Bian on the 6th, hastily redeploying defenses along the Longhai Railway. At this time, another powerful field army under the command of General Liu Bocheng launched a strong counteroffensive on both sides of the Pinghan Railway in northern Henan. Its right-wing army moved south along the Daoqing Railway on the 4th, and at one stroke, recaptured the important town of Bo'ai County on the Daoqing Railway. The Chiang troops in Qinyang and Meng County fled upon hearing the news, and our army has now reached the Yellow River. The left-wing army moved south along the east side of the Pinghan Railway and, around the 29th, once again liberated Fengqiu, Yanjin, Huaxian, Junxian and other county towns. The remnants of the Chiang army's 47th Division and the local bandit Wang Sanzhu's troops abandoned their cities and fled. Our army is now advancing westward, threatening the Yellow River Railway Bridge. The Chiang troops entrenched in Xinxiang and Anyang, under the pincer attack of this large army, feel that the end is near and are transporting their families away one after another. Within Anyang City, fleeing Chiang soldiers and residents number in the hundreds every day. In recent days, the Chiang army's 40th Division has even more frantically conscripted soldiers and vehicles, and sold a large amount of stored grain, causing even more panic in the city, and the trend of fleeing is intensifying.

    大反攻声势震破敌胆
    豫北蒋军惊慌溃退
    我钳形攻势继续进展
    收复孟县城直抵黄河
    【本报特讯】刘伯承将军麾下大军，南渡黄河揭开大反攻序幕后，豫北各线蒋军闻风溃退，形如惊弓之鸟，蒋军所处形势之恶劣，实出蒋介石所意料。上月廿九日，蒋介石王仲廉还在大吹牛皮，抽调守卫新乡的卅二师、六十六师，由汲县北窜淇县，企图再次表演打通平汉路安（阳）新（乡）段的丑剧。然而就在这戏刚刚开场的第二天（三十日），刘伯承将军大军渡河反攻的消息，好象一个晴天霹雳，使豫北蒋军全线震动。王仲廉指挥北上的蒋军三十二师、六十六师及留守新乡的整三师，立即在丑剧表演的第三日（七月一日）狼狈撤过黄河。困守安阳的四十师亦图乘机南窜，其先头部一○六旅七月三日南犯汤阴，并由四十一师派一部兵力北犯淇县接应该敌，但均被我军阻击，狼狈窜返原驻地。于是王仲廉把四十师从安阳调往新乡以集中兵力固守一点的企图也告失败。苦心侵入豫北年余的蒋军豫北地区最高指挥官王仲廉，亦不得不于六日由新飞汴，仓惶失措的在陇海沿线重新布置防务。恰在此时，刘伯承将军指挥的另一支强大野战军，又于豫北平汉两侧，发动强大反攻。其右翼大军于四日沿道清路南下，一鼓收复道清重镇博爱县城，沁阳、孟县蒋军闻讯逃窜，我军已直抵黄河。左路大军沿平汉东侧南下，于二十九日前后再度解放封邱、延津、滑县、浚县等县城，蒋军残部四十七师及土顽王三珠部，均弃城逃走，我军正挥戈西向，威胁黄河铁桥。困踞新乡、安阳蒋军，在此钳形大军夹击下，已感末日的到来，纷纷将家眷运走；安阳城内逃亡蒋军和居民，每日均以数百计。近日蒋军四十师更疯狂抓丁、抓车，并将储存粮食大批出卖，致城内更形恐慌，逃亡之风愈炽。
