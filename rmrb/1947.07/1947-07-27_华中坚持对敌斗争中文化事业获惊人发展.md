Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 25th -- Cultural undertakings in the Central China liberated areas have achieved remarkable development amidst the patriotic self-defense war. The journalism work in Central Jiangsu, in its persistence and combination with the masses, has seen great growth. At the beginning of the war, the entire region only had three kinds of letterpress newspapers and several mimeographed newspapers. Currently, in the four counties south of the Hai'an-Taizhou line alone, there are more than twenty newspapers such as "Huangqiao Outpost" and "Cheng-Huang Line." The dissemination of battle news and experience is extremely rapid, penetrating deep into the central areas of districts and townships, and there is even the "Jianghai Guide," a four-page newspaper published daily. The Jianghai Daily, People's Daily, and Jianghai Frontline newspapers in various sub-districts have persisted in guerrilla warfare to this day, still maintaining a four-page letterpress edition every other day. In Northern Jiangsu, there are more than twenty newspapers and magazines such as the "Huanghai Daily" and the "Huaihai Daily," among which the three-color mimeographed "Ye Ting Daily," self-edited, self-drawn, and self-printed by the artist Cang Shi, is particularly popular among the masses. Northern Jiangsu has now established three Xinhua branch offices. Reporters from each branch office and newspaper frequently enter and exit the Kuomintang army's blockade line, fighting alongside the guerrillas. Even during combat, they carry iron pens and steel plates, engaging in guerrilla warfare while conducting interviews. Whenever there is an opportunity, they concentrate their efforts on publishing. People's journalists have endured hardships in their perseverance, demonstrating unwavering courage. Ye Bangjin, Qian Yi (the eldest son of the writer A Ying), and others gloriously sacrificed their lives in the struggle. The communication work in Northern Jiangsu has always been known for its mass character, with the nine counties of the Yanfu District submitting over ten thousand manuscripts per month. Correspondents in the "suppression" areas often write manuscripts in trenches and cellars. The fifth sub-district of Northern Jiangsu created the "Bogu" correspondent and "Bogu" correspondent group to carry out the "April 8th" communication competition, which is currently being summarized. Education work in Central Jiangsu has also developed extensively. A certain district in Taixian County has developed to more than sixty primary schools, five times more than before the anti-"suppression" campaign. At the peak, the number of enrolled children accounted for 85% of the total number of school-age children. Middle school students hold books in one hand and guns in the other, studying and fighting alongside the militia. The literacy class organized by Taizhou No. 2 Middle School absorbed two thousand militiamen, one thousand seven hundred women, and one thousand five hundred children. The school also organized drama troupes and blackboard newspapers in twenty-nine townships. During the recent land reform movement, the section led by the school was often the most thorough in carrying out the land reform. There are also many new creations in combining propaganda work with armed struggle. In addition to Cao Dejin's "cultural backpack" in Taixian County, there is also the Bao Yingzhong Fort mobile propaganda team. The team consists of three people with three guns who carry a Banhu fiddle on their backs and a bucket of lime in their hands. If there is an enemy situation, they fight; if there is no enemy situation, they play the Huqin and sing, and pick up the lime bucket and write.

　　华中坚持对敌斗争中文化事业获惊人发展
    【新华社华中二十五日电】华中蒋后文化事业在爱国自卫战争中，获惊人发展。苏中新闻工作在与群众的坚持相结和战争伊始，全区仅有三种铅印报与若干油印报，目前仅海（安）泰（州）线以南四县即有黄桥前哨、城黄线上等报纸二十余种。传播战斗消息和经验极为迅速，深入区乡中心地区，并有日出四开的江海导报。各分区的江海报、人民报及江海前线等，游击坚持至目前止，则仍保持隔日四开铅印版。苏北有黄海日报、淮海报等及杂志二十余种，其中艺术家仓石自编、自画、自印之三色油印“叶挺日报”，尤受群众欢迎。现苏北已建立新华分支社三个，各支社及各报记者经常出入蒋军封锁线，与游击队并肩行动，甚至战斗期间背起铁笔钢板一面游击，一面采访，一有机会即集中突击出版。人民记者在坚持中备尝艰苦，英勇不屈，叶邦瑾、钱毅（名文学家阿英之长子）等在斗争中光荣殉职。苏北通讯工作素以群众性著称，盐阜区九县稿件月达万余篇。“清剿”区通讯员常在战壕地窖中写稿。苏北五分区创造“博古”通讯员与“博古”通讯组开展之“四八”通讯竞赛，现已在总结中。苏中教育工作也普遍发展，泰县某区小学即发展到六十余所，比反“清剿”前增加五倍。最盛时期入学儿童占学龄儿童总数百分之八十五。中学生则一手拿书，一手拿枪，一面读书，一面配合民兵打游击。泰州二中组织之识字班吸收了两千民兵，一千七百个妇女和千五百个儿童，该校并组织了二十九个乡的剧团及黑板报。最近破拆运动中，该校领导之地段常是破拆最彻底。宣传工作与武装结合亦有许多新创造。除泰县曹德近的“文化背包”外，又出现宝应中堡流动宣传队，该队三个人三条枪背上梆胡琴，手里提石灰桶，遇敌情就打，没敌情胡琴一拉就唱，拿起石灰桶就写。
