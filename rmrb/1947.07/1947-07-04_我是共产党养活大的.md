　　I Was Raised by the Communist Party
　　Wei Wenbei

　　I was just ten years old when my mother died. At that time, my family was very poor. When the pot was boiling, there was no rice to cook, and in the freezing winter we wore clothes that showed our skin. My father herded sheep for others; my younger sister was sold as a child bride to a blind man of thirty-two; I led the blind man around, going from house to house, without a home or land, suffering all kinds of torment. People often say, "The bald are jealous and the blind are ruthless," and that's how I lived, being beaten and abused for more than three years. Even now, thinking back on it, I want to cry!

　　In 1938, the Eighth Route Army came, drove away the landlords, and the land was returned. My father farmed the land that he hadn't been able to cultivate for years. My younger sister, who had been living under the blind man's feet, also stood up – she broke off the engagement. At this time, I had food to eat, clothes to wear, and a home.

　　After I started working, the Party became even closer to me. The year before last, when I was sick, Political Commissar Wang took time out of his busy schedule to call a doctor to see me. He even bought me eggs, and comrades even helped me with my bowel movements. It was more attentive than a mother to her child. After entering Changzhi City, my thoughts were hidden under the covers. Once I had a quilt, I wanted a mattress and a blanket... there was no end to it. I was also not at ease at work, and I was always giving the organization opinions. The Party severely criticized my thinking, patiently educating me, and the comrades also gave me opinions with a caring spirit, afraid that I would not become a good person.

　　After the New Year this year, I went home for a visit. As soon as I entered the village, someone told me: your family has moved to Hetaba. Hetaba is a better place in our village. As soon as I heard about the move, I was so happy that I didn't know how I walked into the yard. I saw three neat western-style rooms, and two cowsheds to the south, with a big red ox tied to the manger. Walking into the house: there were lacquered tables and chairs on the floor, a picture of Chairman Mao pasted on the front wall, and an old picture of "Fortune, Prosperity, and Longevity" hanging on the east wall next to the bed. The house was so tidy. An old woman in her fifties was sitting on the bed, spinning diligently. I thought I had gone to the wrong house – in the past, the ground was piled with wormwood and thorny bushes, the bed was covered with pots, bowls and yams that hadn't been washed for days, and there was no old woman in the house at all. I turned around to leave, when suddenly a lot of people came in through the door. My father and younger sister also came in. My younger sister happily ran to me and said softly, "The old woman on the bed is our mother, she just got married." Neighbors who hadn't seen me for several years said, "This child has grown up so much." My father then said excitedly and gratefully, "My child, was raised by the Communist Party."

　　Indeed, after my mother left me, I grew up in the arms of the people's mother – the Communist Party. On the occasion of commemorating the 26th anniversary of the Party, I am determined to overcome my wrong thinking and work hard in practical mass work to answer the Party's nurturing of me.

　　我是共产党养活大的
    魏文北
    妈妈死的时候，我刚十岁。当时家里很穷，锅滚了没有米下，数九寒天穿的是露皮衣裳。父亲给人家放羊；妹妹卖给一个三十二岁的瞎子作了童养媳；我在外边拉瞎子，串千家门，无家无地，受尽折磨。人常说：“秃嫉瞎狠”，就这样吃打受气的过了三年多，这时，回忆起来，还想掉泪！
    一九三八年，八路军来了，赶走了地主，房地抽回来了，父亲经营着几年来没有种过的土地。踩在瞎子脚下过生活的妹妹也站起来了——解除了婚约，这时，我有了饭吃，有了衣穿，也有了家。
    参加工作后，党对自己更亲近了。前年，我病时，王政委在百忙中叫上医生给我看病，还给我买有鸡蛋，大小便都得同志们送，真是比娘对孩子还招呼的周到。进了长治城后，自己的思想赞到被子里了，被子有了还想搞褥子、毯子………就没有个完。在工作上也不安心，老是给组织上提意见。党对我这种思想作了严厉的批判，苦心的教育，同志们也以爱护的精神给我提意见，只怕自己成不了人。
    今年过罢年，我回家跑了一趟，刚进村，就有人告诉我：你家搬到河塌上了，河塌上是我村较好的地方，一听到搬家，我高兴的不知怎么就走进院里了。一看：是三间整齐的西房，南面还有两间牛圈，槽上还拴着一头大红牛；走进屋子里：地下摆着油漆的桌椅，正面贴着一张毛主席，挨床的东墙挂着一张古老的福禄祯祥画，家里收拾的怪整齐，床上还坐着一个五十年纪的老太婆，很起劲的在纺花。我以为走错了，——从前地下堆的是老蒿和圪针，床上放着好几天不洗的锅碗和山药蛋，而且家里就根本没有个老太婆呀。我扭头就往出返，忽然从门上进了好多人，父亲和妹妹也进来了，妹妹高兴的跑到我跟前低低的说：“床上那个老婆是咱娘，才结过婚”。好几年没有见过我的邻家们都说：“这孩子可长大了”，父亲紧接着兴奋感激的说：“俺孩，是共产党养活大的”。
    可不，自妈妈丢下我后，就在人民的母亲——共产党的怀抱里生长大的。在纪念党二十六周年的今天，决心克服自己的错误思想，在实际的群众工作中锻炼来回答党对我的抚育。
