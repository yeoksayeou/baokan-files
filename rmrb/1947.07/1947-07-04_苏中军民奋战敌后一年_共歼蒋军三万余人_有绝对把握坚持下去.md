Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 30th – General Guan Wenwei, Commander of the Central Jiangsu Military Region, recently spoke to reporters about the situation in Central Jiangsu's self-defense war over the past year, saying: The people of Central Jiangsu have struggled arduously and successfully persisted behind Chiang's lines for a year. In the past year, the army and people of Central Jiangsu, in 5,126 battles large and small in Dongtai, Beicha, Libao, Dazhongji, Tongyu Line, etc., have killed and captured more than 30,000 Chiang's officers and soldiers, seized weapons equivalent to three complete brigades of Chiang's army, and tied down two reorganized divisions. General Guan Wenwei continued: "Since our army took the initiative to withdraw from Dongtai, the last city in Central Jiangsu, last year, Central Jiangsu has been completely behind enemy lines, and the army and people of Central Jiangsu have since begun a situation of independent and courageous struggle behind Chiang's lines. Because Central Jiangsu is located in a strategic location, controlling the Yangtze River in the south, facing Nanjing and Shanghai, and threatening both Huai'an in the north, and serving as a screen for Central China; therefore, Chiang Kai-shek once proposed a "three-month 'suppression' plan." A total of 49 divisions, one complete division (formerly in Rugao) that was replenished after being annihilated in the south (1024th Division, 90th two brigades, 59th Brigade one regiment, and approximately 80,000 local Chiang's and puppet troops), and the 85th, 60th, 567th Divisions and traffic police brigades that were successively transferred away (not included) from west to east, blockaded the Yang (zhou) Tai (zhou) Hai (an) Beicha line, from south to north, blockaded the Nan(tong) Gan(yu) highway, and the entire Central Jiangsu was divided into four. Starting in January, a comprehensive and then regional "suppression" was carried out, first in the eight counties of Taizhou, Hai'an to the south of the Beicha line, Nantong, Qidong, Haimen, Rugao, Rudong, Jingjiang, Taixing, and Taizhou, and then in the area west of the Grand Canal line in Taizhou, Xinghua Shagou, and Xieyang. Its "suppression" deployment first densely built blockhouses to form a blockade line. On the Taizhou-Beicha line alone, there were more than 1,000 blockhouses. The blockade roads south of Hai(an) Tai(zhou) are crisscrossed like spider webs. The "sweeps" were carried out by dozens of routes advancing and converging, combing and searching, advancing to "encirclements" that went out at sunrise and returned at sunset, and then to village-by-village "garrison suppressions." However, to this day, Chiang's army still only occupies a few transportation lines and some towns in its efforts to eliminate the people's armed forces, destroy democratic organizations, and establish reactionary rule. The vast rural areas are still in our hands. In large areas such as Dongtai, Taipei, Xinghua, and Qintong, the largest of which is hundreds of miles across without any sign of the enemy, land reform and production and construction are still being carried out as usual. We have absolute confidence to persist. Commander Guan pointed out that in the past year's struggle behind Chiang's lines, on the one hand, Chiang Kai-shek's inhumanity has been fully exposed, and on the other hand, the bravery and unyielding, and tenacious struggle of the 10 million army and people have been demonstrated. Chiang's army openly put forward the idea that it is better to kill a thousand by mistake than to let one go, and even set up killing competitions. According to the lowest estimate, Chiang Kai-shek owes the people of Central Jiangsu a blood debt of more than 20,000 innocent people killed, more than 10,000 men conscripted, more than 20,000 families rendered homeless by burnt houses, more than 30,000 women raped, and countless grain and other materials looted. Massacres of hundreds of people in places like Huangqiao, Jingjiang, and Jiagang, and dozens of inhuman tortures, such as tying people to trees and grinding them into meat powder, have exhausted the possibilities of barbarism and cruelty. But the millions of army and people have not yielded, but have instead turned resentment into strength and hatred into courage. Their spirit of bravery, unyielding, and tenacious resistance can truly shock the heavens and move the gods. More than 5,000 cadres have been sheltered and rescued by the people, who sacrificed themselves, their children, their husbands, their houses, and their property. Every time Chiang's army arrived in a place, millions of people within dozens of miles would transfer in an organized manner, and not one was willing to be enslaved by Chiang. However, as soon as the gunfire sounded, the people would fully engage in guerrilla warfare, completely plunging Chiang's army into the ocean of the people, making it difficult to advance or retreat.
    Commander Guan said: In the past year's struggle behind Chiang's lines, we have deeply experienced such a truth: (1) Closely connect with the masses, trust the masses, rely on the masses, and mobilize the masses; (2) Properly lead the masses and launch a comprehensive mass self-defense movement and mass guerrilla warfare; (3) Effectively combine armed forces with the people's struggle. These are the three magic weapons for persisting behind Chiang's lines and achieving certain victory.

　　苏中军民奋战敌后一年
  　共歼蒋军三万余人
    有绝对把握坚持下去
    【新华社华中三十日电】苏中军区司令管文蔚将军顷对记者纵谈苏中自卫战一年来形势称：苏中人民艰苦斗争，并胜利地坚持了蒋后一年。一年内，苏中军民在东台、栟（茶）北、李堡、大中集、通榆线等大小五千一百二十六次战役中，共毙俘蒋军官兵三万余人，缴获相当于蒋军的三个整旅的武器，并且拖住了两个整编师。管文蔚将军继称：“自去年我军主动退出苏中最后一个城市东台后，苏中即全面处于敌后，苏中军民从此开始了独立自主英勇坚持蒋后斗争的局面。苏中因为地处要冲，南控长江，面临京沪，北胁两淮，而屏华中；故蒋介石曾提出“三个月内完成‘清剿’计划”。总计动用四十九师一个整师（曾在如皋）南被歼后又补充者（，一○二四师、九○两个旅，五十九旅一个团，及土著蒋伪约八万余人）陆续调走之八十五、六十、五六十七等师及交警大队未计入）由西至东，封锁了扬（州）泰（州）海（安）栟（茶）一线由南到北，封锁了南（通）赣（榆）公路、整块苏中被分割为四，一月开始，进行了全面的又是分区的“清剿”，首在泰州，海安讫栟茶一线以南南通、啟东、海门、如皋、如东、靖江、泰兴、泰州、八县进行，继又对泰州、兴化沙沟、谢阳以西运河线以东地区进行。其“清剿”部署首先密筑碉堡封锁线，仅泰州至栟茶一线，封锁碉堡达一千个以上。海（安）泰（州）以南之封锁公路，则交错如蛛网。“扫荡”则由数十路分进合击，梳篦搜索，进为日出晚归之“会剿”，再进为村村“驻剿”。但其消灭人民武装摧毁民主组织建立反动统治，迄今为止，蒋军仍仅占几条交通线及部分城镇。广大农村仍在我手。而东台、台北、兴化、溱潼等大块地区，最大者纵横百数十里内无敌踪，照常进行土地改革与生产建设。我们已有绝对把握坚持下去。管司令指出一年来蒋后斗争中一面充分暴露了蒋介石的毫无人性，另一面则表现一千万军民的英勇不屈，顽强斗争。蒋军公开提出宁可错杀一千，不要放走一个，并定有杀人比赛等。据最低估计，蒋介石负苏中人民的血债，为被杀无辜人民二万余，被抽壮丁一万余，被烧房屋而致无家可归者二万余家，被奸妇女三万余，被抢粮食及其他物资则已无法计数。黄桥、靖江、夹港口等地的动辄数百人民的大屠杀，至数十种非人酷刑，如将人绑在树上磨成肉粉等，更极尽野蛮残酷之能事。但千万军民没有屈服，相反的化怨痛为力量，记仇恨为勇敢，其英勇不屈顽强抗争之精神，真能惊天地而泣鬼神。人民舍己、舍子、舍夫、舍房屋、舍财物而护救的干部，已在五千人以上。蒋军每到一地，几十里内千万人有组织转移，没有一个甘心为蒋奴役，但当枪声一响，人们即全面卷入游击运动，使蒋军完全陷入人民大海，进退维谷。
    管司令说：一年来，蒋后斗争，深深体验到这样一种真理：（一）密切联系群众，相信群众，依靠群众，发动群众；（二）很好的领导群众，发动全面的群众性自卫运动，群众性游击战争；（三）很好的掌握武装与人民的斗争紧密结合。是坚持蒋后必胜不败的三件法宝。
