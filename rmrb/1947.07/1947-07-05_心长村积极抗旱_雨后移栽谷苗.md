　　Xinchang Village Actively Fights Drought
　　Transplants Millet Seedlings After Rain
　　[This newspaper, Xingtai News] This year, Xinchang Village, in the Second District, is experiencing drought, making it difficult to plant seedlings. The seedlings in the watered fields are also incomplete, with one-third or one-quarter being short seedlings. Under the slogan of "Planting one seedling is still planting one," the masses are mobilized to transplant seedlings and plant millet, watering one furrow and planting one furrow, pulling up dense seedlings and transplanting them to places without seedlings, watering and planting completely. On June 21st, after a four-finger rain, the men made a surprise attack on sowing, with people pulling plows, and women and children going to the fields to transplant millet seedlings. Feng Erhei and his wife transplanted two and a half mu of millet in two days, and village chief's younger brother, Feng Bao, transplanted millet seedlings despite being sick. The method of transplanting seedlings after the rain: if this land does not have dense seedlings, go to other places to pull seedlings and plant them in short seedling areas, three or four seedlings in a pile, and water them after planting. The millet is a single root, and immediately after planting, five taproots will grow, making it very easy to survive. The whole village transplanted 58 mu in two days. Feng Erhei said, "I planted it that year, and the millet ears were definitely more, yielding more grain."

　　心长村积极抗旱
  　雨后移栽谷苗
    【本报邢台讯】二区心长村今年天旱苗难种，水地苗子也不全，三分之一或四分之一短苗，在种一棵是一棵的口号下，动员群众移苗栽谷，浇一个畦栽一个畦，把稠苗拔来移到没苗的地方，浇完了也栽完了。六月二十一日下了四指雨，男人突击下种，人拉耧犁，妇女儿童下地移谷苗。冯二黑和他女人两天栽谷二亩半，村长弟冯保带着病移谷苗。下了雨移苗办法：如这地没稠苗到别地拔苗栽到短苗地里，三、四棵一堆，栽毕浇些水，谷子是一个独根，栽后马上就踏下五叉根，很好活。全村两天栽五十八亩，冯二黑说：“那年我栽过，谷穗硬不少打粮食。”
