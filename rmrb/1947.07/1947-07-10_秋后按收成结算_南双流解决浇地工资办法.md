　　Settling Accounts After the Autumn Harvest Based on Yield
  　Nan Shuangliu Solves Irrigation Wage Issue
    [Our Newspaper] Nan Shuangliu Village in Neiqiu First District calculated that the village had twenty mu of paddy fields and two hundred and fifty mu of dry land that could be converted into paddy fields. Mutual aid made it possible to plant autumn seedlings. Initially, the enthusiasm for irrigation was very high. In addition to irrigating the existing paddy fields, they irrigated more than ninety mu of dry land in one go. Later, the masses' enthusiasm gradually waned! Some said: "If it doesn't rain, how long are we going to keep irrigating? The daily wage is six jin of rice, and we don't know what the harvest will be like this year. Even if we get a small harvest in the autumn, we won't be able to pay people's wages." Therefore, no one planned to irrigate anymore, and the mutual aid group collapsed invisibly. When the production committee heard this feedback, it convened the masses to discuss: If the land isn't irrigated, nothing can be done. How can we eat and drink if we don't plant seedlings? Without mutual aid, no one has enough manpower, and there's no way to irrigate. As a result of the discussion, they came up with a solution, implementing work point recording (work point accounts don't use work tickets), and dividing profits after the autumn harvest: (1) The labor used for mutual aid irrigation is now recorded in work point accounts. The stipulated wages are not settled now, but will be settled after the autumn harvest. (2) If the grain harvested in the autumn is not enough to pay wages, it will be distributed in batches according to the labor contributed by the group members, with those who contributed more getting more and those who contributed less getting less. (3) If it rains continuously after the irrigated land is planted with seedlings, and everyone plants the land, the land will be returned to the original owner, and accounts will be settled with wages after the autumn harvest. Everyone felt that this method was appropriate, and one household immediately handed over the ten mu of dry land that it could convert to the group. Now, each group is irrigating according to this method, and the masses' enthusiasm is even higher than before.

　　秋后按收成结算
  　南双流解决浇地工资办法
    【本报讯】内邱一区南双流村计算全村有水地二十亩，旱地能变水地二百五十亩，互助起来都能够种上秋苗，起初浇地劲头非常大，除浇原有水地外，一鼓气旱地也浇了九十多亩。后来群众劲头渐渐消极下去！有的说：“天要不下雨，光浇浇到几时？一天工资六斤米，年景还不知道怎样的？秋天就是打一把，连工资也给不起人家。”因此，谁也不打算再浇，互助组也无形中垮了台。生产委员会听到这种反映便召集群众商量：地不浇不能干，按不上苗那里来吃喝？不互助，谁家人手也不够用，又没法浇。商量的结果，想出解决办法，实行记工（记工帐不用工票），秋后分红：（一）互助浇地用的劳力现在记上工帐，规定的工资现在不清算，到秋后算帐。（二）如到秋后地里打粮不够工资，就按组员们出的劳力分批，该多的多该少的少。（三）如润种的地按上苗后天不断下雨，大家都种上地，还把地退给原主，秋后按工资互相找清。大家都觉得这办法合适，当下就有一户把他能变的十亩旱地交给组里。现在各组都按着这个办法浇起来，群众劲头比先更高。
