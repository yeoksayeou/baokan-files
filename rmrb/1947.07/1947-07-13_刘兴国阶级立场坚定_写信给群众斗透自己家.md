    Liu Xingguo Has a Firm Class Stand: Writes to the Masses to Thoroughly Struggle Against His Own Family
    [This newspaper's dispatch] Comrade Liu Xingguo, a civil affairs cadre of the Taihang 104th unit, is from Ludong, Neiqiu. His family is a landlord. Before Japan surrendered, his uncle tried to persuade him to return home. Not only was he unmoved, but he also reported it to the organization and suggested to the district chief that his uncle and family be struggled against, but the struggle was not thorough enough. Later, his village was placed under the jurisdiction of the Taihang District, and the mass movement was carried out very vigorously. A few days ago, his brother-in-law, Han Taozi, wrote to him saying, "I have been struggled against, and mother was imprisoned once," asking him to go back and see. He refused the family's unreasonable demands, firmly refused to return, and also wrote a special letter to the village cadres, conveying to the masses that his mother had engaged in usury and should be liquidated, and asking the village cadres to boldly lead the masses to continue working, so that the masses could thoroughly turn themselves over.

    写信给群众斗透自己家
    【本报讯】太行一○四部民运干事刘兴国同志，内邱路东人，家庭是个经营地主，日本投降前他叔父曾活动他回家，他不仅不为所动，还向组织作了报告，并向区长建议斗他叔父和家庭，结果还没有斗彻底。后来他村划归太行区，群众运动开展得很猛烈，前几天他姐夫韩桃子来信告诉他说：“被斗了，母亲被关了一次”，叫他回去看看。他拒绝了家里不合理的要求，坚决不回去，还特别给村干部写了一封信，转达群众，说他母亲放过帐，该清算，并要村干部大胆领导群众干下去，让群众彻底翻身。
