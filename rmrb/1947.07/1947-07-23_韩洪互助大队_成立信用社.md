　　Han Hong Mutual Aid Team
  　Establishes Credit Cooperative
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 21st dispatch] The Han Hong Mutual Aid Team in Qinyuan has developed labor mutual aid into capital cooperation, absorbing 580,000 yuan of idle funds from team members and investing them in production endeavors. The Han Hong Mutual Aid Team has a total of 397 male and female members, completing spring plowing, summer planting, weeding, and other tasks on time. It has also systematically addressed the issue of surplus labor, establishing four mutual aid cooperatives, including "Qin Ji," "Hong Ji," and "Xing Ji." However, due to the cooperatives' limited capital, they lacked the capacity to directly assist members in production, leaving members' earnings from surplus labor without adequate support and hindering the circulation of wealth, thus affecting income. To resolve this difficulty and implement the policy of combining agriculture and sideline occupations with year-round mutual aid, the mutual aid team proposed "moving from labor mutual aid towards capital cooperation." After allowing the masses to deliberate and discuss, everyone unanimously agreed to establish a credit cooperative. Team members eagerly purchased shares, absorbing 580,000 yuan in idle funds within three days. Some invested pigs, some invested shoes, and some even contributed cash, incorporating the previous Qin Ji, Hong Ji, and other four cooperatives under the unified leadership of the new credit cooperative. A policy was determined to "increase lending during busy farming seasons and organize everyone to engage in sideline production during slack seasons." The following are some specific measures: (1) Use three-fifths of the capital for lending, with interest rates of 4% to 5% for textiles, 6% to 8% for mutual aid transportation, and 10% to 15% for commerce. In cases of urgent needs such as weddings, funerals, or epidemics, interest may be waived within five days. Team members have priority in obtaining loans. (2) Only fixed-term deposits are accepted, with a monthly interest rate of 4%, calculated at 5% for deposits of three months or more, 6% for deposits of six months or more, and 7% for deposits of one year. (3) The value of each share is 1,000 yuan. (4) Use two-fifths of the capital to operate textiles, transportation, workshops, etc., to ensure rapid capital turnover. However, operations must be specialized, and funds must be independent to avoid mutual entanglement. (5) When calculating accounts, the profits and losses of the masses must be calculated to clarify the supporting role, but the average profit should not be abandoned, so as to gradually accumulate capital.

　　韩洪互助大队
  　成立信用社
    【本报太岳二十一日电】沁源韩洪互助大队，劳动互助发展到资金合作，吸收组员游资五十八万元，投入生产事业中。韩洪互助大队共有男女组员三百九十七人，按时完成了春耕夏种锄苗等工作，并有计划的处理了余工问题，先后搞起“沁记”、“洪记”、“兴记”，等四个互助合作社，但因互助合作社资本少，没力帮助社员直接搞生产，使社员们余工所赚工钱缺少帮助，流动不开，影响财富收入。互助组为解决这一困难，贯彻农副业结合与全年互助的方针，就提出“由劳动互助走向资金合作”，并让群众酝酿讨论，结果大家一致同意成立个信用合作社，社员争相入股，三天内吸收游资达五十八万元。有的入猪，有的入鞋，还有的把现洋也拿出来入了股，并将以前的沁记、洪记、等四个合作社，统一于该社领导，并决定“农忙多放款，农闲多组织大家搞副业生产”的方针，以下是几个具体办法：（一）用五分之三的资本往出放款，纺织四分到五分利，互助运输六分到八分利。经商一角到一角五分利。如遇婚、丧、疫病等紧急用项，在五天内可以不付息。社员贷款有优先权。（二）只办定期存款，每月四分利，存三个月以上按五分计算，六个月以上按六分计算，一年按七分计算；（三）款额每股一千元；（四）以五分之二的资本，经营纺织、运输、作坊等，以使资本迅速运转。但业务必须专营，资金必须独立，以免互相拉扯；（五）算帐时要算出群众的盈亏，明确扶植作用，但不放弃平均利润，以便逐渐积累资本。
