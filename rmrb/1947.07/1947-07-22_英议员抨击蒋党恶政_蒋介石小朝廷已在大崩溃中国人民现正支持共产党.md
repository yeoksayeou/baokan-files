　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th—According to delayed news from Shanghai newspapers, British Conservative MP Mr. Fflychue published an article in the Street Journal on March 20 entitled "The Corrupt Politics of China," believing that Chiang Kai-shek's corrupt government, which is resisted by the people of the whole country, is on the verge of collapse. The article stated: "I believe that in both political and economic aspects, the situation of Chiang Kai-shek's government in China is in a major collapse. The government's political power is obviously weakening and is not increasing in any place. The people are increasingly distrustful of the government. Even Chiang Kai-shek's own local governments are too lazy to offer false courtesies to the Nanjing government. The people are turning to support the Communist Party. The Communist Party is able to meet the living requirements of the farmers and coolies, so it can gain the active support of the people in many provinces." Mr. Flychue said: "This force of popular dissatisfaction, as well as the Nanjing government's inertia and blindness, will lead to a nationwide guerrilla war.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th—According to Tianjin newspapers: On June 29th, Qingdao vendor Chen Luping was selling popsicles when he reached the front of the U.S. military camp on Tianmen Road. He was unreasonably shot and killed by U.S. sentry Charles. The citizens of Qingdao were extremely indignant. On July 2nd, U.S. soldiers in Nanjing drove a jeep and damaged the glass of a sweet rice wine stall on Xin Street. The vendor Wang Hongjing requested compensation. The U.S. soldiers in the car became beastly and, without asking the reason, beat him severely. The vendor cried uncontrollably, arousing public anger among the onlookers, who surrounded the jeep and demanded that the police send the U.S. soldiers to the station for interrogation. The Chiang's police actually replied: "This matter involves international issues and should be handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The police can't handle it."

　　英议员抨击蒋党恶政
  　蒋介石小朝廷已在大崩溃中国人民现正支持共产党
    【新华社陕北十九日电】据沪报迟到消息，英国保守党议员佛莱邱在三月二十日斯特街报发表题为“中国之恶政”一文，认为遭受全国人民反抗之蒋介石恶政府已摇摇欲坠。该文称：“我认为无论在政治经济方面，中国蒋介石政府局势已在大崩溃中，政府的政治力量正在很明显地减弱，没有一个地方是在增加，人民对政府愈来愈不信任，甚至蒋介石自己的地方政府亦懒得再向南京政府献假殷勤，人民转而支持共产党。而共产党对农民苦力能满足其生活的要求，故能获得许多省份人民的积极支持”。佛氏说：“这种人民不满的力量以及南京政府之惰性与盲目，将导致全国性的游击战争。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】据天津报载：六月二十九日青岛小贩陈禄平售卖冰棍，行至天门路美军营前，即被美哨兵查礼士无理开枪击毙，青岛市民至表激愤。七月二日，南京美军架吉普在新街口碰坏路旁甜酒酿摊玻璃，小贩王鸿经要求赔偿，车中美军兽性大作，不问情由，竟将其痛殴一顿，小贩泣不成声，引起围观群众公愤，包围吉普，要求警察将美军送所讯办；蒋记警察竟答称：“此事牵涉国际问题，应由外交部办理，警察管不着。”
