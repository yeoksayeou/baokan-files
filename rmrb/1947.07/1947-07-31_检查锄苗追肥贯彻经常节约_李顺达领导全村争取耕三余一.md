　　Checking Weeding and Topdressing, Implementing Regularly and Saving
  　Li Shunda Leads the Whole Village to Strive for "Cultivate Three, Surplus One"
    [This Newspaper, Pingshun News] Shadi City Village, in the Second District, under the leadership of Li Shunda, inspected and summarized the second weeding on July 15th. After a day of inspection and summary, most of the village has completed two weedings. In terms of saving and preparing for famine, achievements have also been made. Comparing before and after the savings, before the savings, the whole village ate yellow "ge ta" (a type of corn bread) and rice soup in the morning, rice thin congee and noodle soup at noon, and yellow "ge ta" and noodle soup at night. From June 20th to July 20th, a total of one month, the whole village changed to rice meals. Out of the village's 58 households, the proportion of grain to bran was 4:6 for one household, 5:5 for 26 households, 6:4 for 20 households, 7:3 for 5 households, and 8:2 for 6 households. Through such savings, Li Shunda's family saved nine "dou" of grain in one month, and the whole village saved a total of fifteen "shi," three "dou," and six "sheng" of grain. They gathered over 8,000 "jin" of wild vegetables, and have now dried 2,600 "jin" of dried vegetables. Transportation earned a total of 62,000 "yang," buying back 172 "jin" of rice, 220 "jin" of corn, and 100 "jin" of bran, and combined with planting vegetables, barley, naked oats, beans, etc., for a total of 102.4 "mu."
    On the basis of this summary, in order to lead the masses to continue to clarify the direction of production, focusing on agricultural production, combined with sideline occupations, increasing grain, and saving regularly, Li Shunda convened a meeting of 40 activists in the village on the night of the 18th of this month. Li Shunda proposed: (1) What methods can we think of to increase grain? (2) How can we think of ways to get rich? This inspired the enthusiasm of the activists, and they had a heated discussion. Guo Changze said: "Last year, I weeded the millet three times, and each 'dou' produced one more 'jin' of rice. Weeding twice resulted in one 'sheng' less rice per 'dou'. This year, I will still weed three times." Zhang Bian said: "Topdressing is a major event. Last year, I applied topdressing once, and by autumn, the corn cobs were very full." Li Shunda then proposed: "Our whole village must achieve the ability to earn stored grain, not stored fertilizer." Zhang Laiquan said: "If the land is to be strong, it must be ditched twice every three years." In the discussion, everyone unanimously decided to buy oil for fertilizer if there was no fertilizer. Now is the time for topdressing. If more fertilizer can be applied, more seeds will be produced. Zhang Laiquan also said: "Listening to the words of heroes will lead to prosperity. When I weeded the second time, I listened to Shunda and started early. Just after weeding the second seedlings, there was a heavy rain, and now the seedlings are not dry and have benefited greatly. We draw out labor and animal power from sideline occupations to engage in sideline occupations and buy back grain." From then on, everyone unanimously clarified the importance of both agriculture and sideline occupations, using various methods to increase grain to achieve "cultivate three, surplus one," prevent disasters, and support the front line.
    The day after the meeting, Shunda led three people to apply fertilizer to his own fields first, applying six "mu" in two days. Zhang Laiquan personally went to mobilize the masses, and on the 20th, he personally went to the county to buy back eight and a half "jin" of oil for the masses. After five days of statistics, the whole village applied a total of 1,243 "dan" of manure, 417 "dan" of night soil, 57 "dan" of pig manure, and 410 "dan" of miscellaneous fertilizer, for a total of 1,127 "dan" of fertilizer. In addition, 8.5 "jin" of castor oil and 10 "jin" of pine oil were applied, for a total of 18.5 "jin" of oil. Currently, 89% of the cornfields in the village have been topdressed. In terms of sideline occupations, Zhang Xinxiang has already led two animals out for transportation. The masses in the whole village are working enthusiastically, and everyone is striving to make contributions in production. (Shuang Hong, Shi Xiu)
    [Another News] Zhang Manyou's mutual aid team in Jingquan Village, Second District, Pingshun, held a meeting on the night of July 22nd to check on weeding. After each team reported, the second weeding of corn and millet had already been completed, and the third weeding of millet had been completed on 23 "mu." If there is rain, it will all be completed in another four days. Topdressing has also been completed. After calculating in this way, a total of 23 workdays were saved. Zhang Yangshun said: "If my two 'mu' of land hadn't been weeded twice, the roots wouldn't have been able to take hold. It was no good starting too early, and the soil was too hard to weed. Now that it has been weeded twice, the seedlings are growing vigorously, the roots are taking hold deeply, and the soil is loose, saving one workday when hoeing. The seedlings that weren't weeded fell over, but my seedlings are growing very neatly." Manyou also said: "This year's famine is particularly severe. How should we increase grain and gather more vegetables?" Comrade Yang Dehai from the district deliberately said: "What do we plan to plant on our wheat fields?" With this question, everyone started discussing. Some said: "If we rotate crops, the wheat next year won't grow well, and we'll get less flour." Comrade Manyou said: "One 'mu' of wheat land can yield two 'shi' of barley and also harvest thirty to forty 'dan' of vegetables. If we don't rotate crops, we can harvest one more 'dou' per 'mu' next year, and each 'dou' will yield one more 'jin' of flour. Which is more appropriate?" Zhang Sugen said: "According to this, I will plant vegetables on my half 'mu' of wheat land. After the White Dew season, I will harvest the vegetables in the autumn and apply night soil. I guarantee a good harvest!" Zhang Leigen said: "I will do the same with my half 'mu' of wheat land." The team has a total of 11.4 "mu" of wheat land and plans to rotate crops on 7 "mu," planting barley and vegetables, and to rush to plant wheat on 9.5 "mu" of land. The old habit of fallowing wheat land in this village has been broken from now on. This practice is being promoted throughout the village. (Liu Zheng, Dehai)

　　检查锄苗追肥贯彻经常节约
  　李顺达领导全村争取耕三余一
    【本报平顺讯】二区沙底城村，在李顺达领导下，于七月十五日检查节约锄二遍苗。经过一天来的检查总结，全村已大部锄了两遍苗。在节约备荒方面，亦已获得成绩；从节约前后对比看，节约以前，全村早上吃黄圪塔、米汤，晌午吃的米涝饭、面穗汤，到夜里吃的黄圪塔、面穗汤。至六月二十日到七月二十日共一个月时间内，全村都换了饭，全村共五十八户，粮四糠六的一户，糠五粮五有二十六户，糠四粮六有二十户，粮七糠三的有五户，糠二粮八的有六户。经过这样节约，如李顺达家一月省粮九斗，全村共省粮十五石三斗六升，共打野菜八千余斤，现已晒起干菜二千六百斤。运输共赚洋六万二千元，买回米一百七十二斤，玉茭二百二十斤，糠一百斤，并结合种菜、大麦、莜麦、豆等共一百零二亩四分。
    在这个总结的基础上，李顺达为了领导群众继续明确生产方向，以农业生产为主，结合副业，增加粮食，经常节约。即在本月十八日夜召开了全村四十个积极分子会议。李顺达提出：（一）咱们想什么办法增加粮食？（二）怎样想办法发财？启发了积极分子情绪，热烈的讨论：郭长则说：“我去年谷锄三遍每斗多出一斤米，锄二遍的每斗少出米一升，今年还要锄三遍。”张扁则说：“上追肥顶大事，我去年上一次追肥，到秋天玉茭穗尖吹的很满。”李顺达接着提出：“咱们全村要做到能赚陈粮，不赚陈肥。”张来全说：“地里要想壮，三年两打坑。”在讨论中都一致决定没肥买油上，现在正是上追肥的时候，如能多上肥，就能多结籽，张来全又说：“听上英雄话，才能发了家。我在锄二遍时听上顺达话，早下手，刚锄下二遍苗时，天下一场大雨，现在小苗不旱，沾了大光、在副业上抽出劳力、畜力搞副业，买回粮食。”从此都一致明确认识农业副业都重要，用各种办法增加粮食达到耕三余一，防备灾荒，支援前线。
    会后第二天，顺达领导三个人先往自己地里追肥在两天上了六亩。张来全亲自去动员群众，在二十日亲自到县给群众买回油八斤半，五天统计，全村共上圈肥一千二百四十三担，圊肥四百一十七担，猪肥五十七担，杂肥四百一十担，共肥一千一百二十七担。另上蓖麻油八斤半，柏油十斤，共上油十八斤半。现全村玉茭地的百分之八十九皆上了追肥。在副业上张新香已领导两头牲口出去运输。全村群众，干得热轰轰的，人人争取生产中立功。（双红、世秀）
    【又讯】平顺二区井泉村张满有互助队于七月二十二日夜，召开会议检查锄苗，经各组汇报玉茭谷二遍工早已完成，谷第三遍锄了二十三亩，如要有雨，再有四天全部完成。上追肥也已完成，这样计算了一下，共省工二十三个。张羊顺说：“我那二亩地要不是锄了二遍，根子札不下去，早的也不行了，硬的也锄不动了，现在锄过二遍，苗子长的旺，根子札的深，地皮松，搂时能省一个工。没锄的苗子刮倒了，我的苗长的很周正。满有又说：“今年灾荒特别严重，咱们应该怎样增加粮食多采菜。”区上杨德海同志有意识的说：“咱们的麦地计划种什么？”他两这样一提，大家就拉开了。有的说：“要调茬明年麦子就长不好了，也要少出面。”满有同志说：“一亩麦地赶上大麦能打二石，还能拔三四十担菜。如果不调茬；明年每亩多打上一斗，每斗多出上一斤面，到底是怎样合适。”张宿根说：“照这样说来，我那半亩麦地要种上菜，白露赶上麦子，秋天拔了菜，浇上圊肥，保险要收好哩：”张垒根说：“我有半亩麦地也照他那样干”。该队共麦地十一亩四分，要调茬七亩，种大麦、菜，赶茬麦地九亩五。这村古来歇茬麦地的旧习惯，从此打破了。这样做法正在全村推广中。（刘铮、德海）
