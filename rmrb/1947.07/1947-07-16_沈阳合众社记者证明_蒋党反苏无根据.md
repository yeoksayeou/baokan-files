    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 13th: A United Press dispatch from Shenyang on the 11th stated that the intense attacks by high-ranking Kuomintang military leaders in Manchuria against "Soviet assistance to the Communists" have prompted neutral observers here to react with everything from mild skepticism to accusations that the Kuomintang is deliberately trying to provoke a U.S.-Soviet conflict. These reactions are based on the Kuomintang offering only the weakest evidence to support their accusations. The reporter stated that three points are particularly noteworthy: First, although Kuomintang commanders have claimed that a large number of Soviet officers and technicians are directing or assisting Communist troops, they have never captured and identified a single one, nor has anyone told neutral observers that they have personally witnessed Soviet aid to the Communists. The only visible "evidence" is a photograph hanging in a studio of a Soviet officer with a group of Chinese soldiers. The period when the photo was taken is not specified—such films were easy to take before the Soviet withdrawal from Manchuria—and there is no indication in this evidence that this group of Chinese soldiers are Communists. Second, although the Kuomintang has announced that over 100,000 people from northern Korea are participating in the Chinese civil war, and that a large number of Koreans have been captured, they have not yet allowed a single neutral person to visit or see these northern Koreans. The Koreans captured by the Kuomintang have all been living in Manchuria for a long time. Third, the Kuomintang directly or indirectly attacks the Soviet Union for supplying the Communists with large quantities of munitions, especially during the battle of Sipingjie. Neutral observers who visited Sipingjie after the battle saw no evidence of such large quantities of munitions. The few Soviet-made equipment displayed by the Kuomintang were all incomplete and collected haphazardly, and most were very old. One rifle was even engraved with the Czar's eagle emblem. The United Press reporter concluded: As a result of developments over the past few weeks, some neutral observers here argue that the real threat to world peace is not "Soviet aid" and the CCP, but the Kuomintang's exaggeration of such so-called "aid." They accuse the Kuomintang generals of seeing that only full U.S. aid can save them, if the United States is willing to risk provoking a third world war to provide such aid.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 12th: Washington: Several American commentators and newspapers, in commenting on Chiang Kai-shek's "July 7th" speech, have exposed Chiang Kai-shek's anti-Soviet plot to deceive the United States. Rosinger, a well-known American expert on Far Eastern issues, wrote in the "Foreign Policy Report," listing various facts to refute the lie of "Soviet aid to the CCP" as baseless. The Christian Science Monitor editorial on the 8th stated: "The Chinese government (Chiang's government) once made new promises of reform, but the government (Chiang) has now taken them lightly. The government (Chiang) predicts that it will complete the victory over the Communist army within a year, but those who have a little understanding of the situation do not believe it." After exposing Chiang Kai-shek's excuse of "Soviet aid to the CCP in order to threaten the United States to help Nanjing," the newspaper stated: "If Nationalist China faces collapse one day, it will be due to internal disintegration rather than external pressure from the Communists." The St. Louis Star-Times editorial refuted Dong Xian Guang's anti-Soviet provocation that the Chinese civil war has become an international war, stating: "A certain Chinese writer recently said in a very frank tone: 'We do not intend to deny the current incompetence and corruption of the Nanjing government.'" This writer's remarks are more truthful than what Dong Xian Guang said, who is still trying to use simple propaganda to make the Chinese civil strife into an international war.

    沈阳合众社记者证明
    蒋党反苏无根据
    【新华社陕北十三日电】合众社十一日电，该社记者自沈阳报导称：过去数周中，满洲国民党高级军事领袖对“苏联帮助共产党”的猛烈攻击，已引起此间中立观察家由保持温和的怀疑，以至责难国民党故意试图挑起美苏冲突等各种反应。这些反应乃基于国民党只提出了最无力的证据来支持他们的非难。该记者称：有三点是特别显著的：第一、虽然国民党司令官曾称有大批苏联军官与技术人员指挥或协助共产党部队，但他们从未虏获而指出过一个来，甚至也没一个人告诉过中立的观察家们，他曾亲见苏联援助共产党。仅有的可见的“证据”，即是一张挂在摄影室里一个苏联军官与一群中国士兵的照片，照片拍摄的时期也未说明——此种影片在苏联撤离满洲以前是容易摄取的——，并且这证据上也没有能显示这群中国士兵即是共产党的征号。第二、虽然国民党宣布朝鲜北部有十万余人参与中国内战，且有大批韩人已被俘虏，但至今尚未允许一个中立人士访问或参观一下这些北部朝鲜人。国民党所提出的被俘朝鲜人，都是许久以前即居住满洲的。第三、国民党直接或间接的攻击苏联供给共产党大量军火，特别是在四平街战斗之中；四平战斗后访问过四平街的中立观察家，并未看见有此种大量军火的证据。国民党所陈列出的少数苏联制造的装备，也都是残缺不全地搜罗来的，而且大多数都非常陈旧，其中一支步枪还刻着沙皇的鹰章。合众社记者结语称：过去数周中事态发展的结果，此间某些中立的观察家争辩着，世界和平的真正威胁不是“苏联的援助”与中共，而是国民党对这类所谓“援助”的夸张。他们指责国民党的将军们看到只有美国的全力帮助才能拯救他们，假如美国甘冒引起第三次大战的危险供给此种援助的话。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】华府讯：美国若干评论员及报纸在评论蒋介石“七七”演说时，都指破了蒋介石的反苏骗美阴谋。美著名远东问题专家罗辛格在“外交政策报告”中撰文，列举种种事实，驳斥“苏联援助中共”之谎言为毫无根据。基督教科学箴言报八日社论称：“中国政府（蒋政府）曾有实行改革之新诺言，对于此种诺言，政府（蒋）现已淡然置之。政府（蒋）预言在一年内完成对共军之胜利，但对时局稍有认识者，均不予置信。”该报在指破蒋介石借口“苏联援助中共以便威胁美国非援助南京不可”之后称：“国民党中国如果一日面临崩溃，则其由于内部分解者实不下于共产党外来之压力。”圣路易明星报社论驳斥董显光所谓中国内战已成国际性战争之反苏挑拨称：“中国某作家最近以非常坦白之语调称：“我们不拟否认目前南京政府之无能与腐败。”此一作家之言论，实较董显光所说的更为真实，董氏则犹企图以简单之宣传使中国内乱成为一种国际性战争。”
