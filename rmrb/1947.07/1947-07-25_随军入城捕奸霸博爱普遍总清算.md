　　[Our Newspaper, Bo'ai News] After the People's Liberation Army liberated Bo'ai County on the afternoon of July 5th, the people of the entire county, who had suffered immensely, lifted their heads and joyfully began to arrest traitors, dig out the roots of evil, and seek revenge. Within five days, from the 6th to the 10th, in 106 villages throughout the county (accounting for 53% of the county's villages), a widespread and vigorous movement to oppose traitors, seek revenge, and conduct liquidations was launched. When our People's Liberation Army began fighting, the people of the entire county were extremely excited and spontaneously organized capture teams, armed with red-tasseled spears, broadswords, wooden sticks, and other weapons, and followed the army into the city. Under the unified leadership of the Public Security Bureau, they arrested special agents, local tyrants, instigators of counter-settlements, and major criminals such as Wang Gutang, the puppet county magistrate of Jincheng, within four days. During the arrests, the masses were extremely enthusiastic. A special agent from Sanjie in the city fled to the home of an old man over seventy years old. The old man shouted loudly, telling all the men, women, and children of his family to tie up the special agent, saying, "Even if you crawl back into your mother's womb, you won't escape today." A militiaman from Xizhuang was very active, coming to the city dozens of times a day, searching carefully everywhere, and once discovered a hidden local tyrant in a bamboo garden. The movement started with district and village celebration meetings. The broad masses gnashed their teeth, determined to seek revenge, and were engaged in tense struggles day and night. In the Sixth District, except for five villages, the remaining nineteen villages universally and vigorously launched struggles, conducting thirty-five struggles in three days. Xizhuang Village conducted two struggles in one day. In Garden Village, the masses denounced and beat the local tyrant continuously for two hours. The main characteristics of the movement were: "Quick struggles, no formalities." It was the principle of the masses' opinions and the cadres' leadership. After each movement, the masses were satisfied, their hearts greatly gladdened, and they celebrated their liberation. Currently, except for the First and Seventh Districts, all districts have universally launched the movement. On the 11th, the entire county held a revenge meeting of 30,000 people. At the request of the masses, the special agent and bandit leader Wang Laoqi, who had long eaten human flesh and drunk human blood, was suppressed, further enhancing the masses' will to fight. The movement is now developing vigorously. (Li Ping, Qi Zhou)

　　[Our Newspaper, Lingchuan News] The people of the entire county publicly tried the top-level traitor Zhang Jianmin on the 15th of this month. Zhang is from Shangbai Village, Yushe County, Shanxi Province, 29 years old, from a landlord family, and was appointed by Yan Xishan as the puppet county magistrate of Lingchuan. He was captured when our army liberated Quwo. During the public trial, the head of the county government's judicial section announced his crimes, and the masses shouted that they wanted to handle him themselves. At that time, the government responded to the demands of the masses and handed him over to the people to handle themselves. The masses were extremely emotional. The heroes who participated in the county's textile hero meeting personally stepped forward to question him, and he admitted that he and the local special agent and traitor Tian Yongqing were working together as special agents, preparing to return to Lingchuan to kill the people. At that time, the masses were filled with hatred. Comrade Si Aizhen, a textile hero, led the masses in shouting: "We must resolutely eliminate these special agents and traitors and not let them come back to kill our people." Comrade Zheng Qiuping, a top-level textile hero, shouted: "The front defeats Chiang Kai-shek, the rear opposes special agents and digs out the roots of evil." Under the激憤 of the masses, this top-level traitor was executed by the masses, and the masses happily said: "This has eliminated another great harm!" (Wen Fu, Jin Shui, Xiao Fu, Er Hai)
