Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 21st—The People's Liberation Army in northern Henan, along the Daokou-Qinghua Railway, is expanding its offensive, successively capturing the county towns of Wuzhi (the new town of Mulandian, three miles east of the old town) and Xiuwu, as well as the important stronghold of Daiwangzhen (west of Xiuwu), eliminating 2,000 enemy troops. At 12:00 PM on the 16th, the Liberation Army launched a fierce attack on Mulandian, killing, wounding, and capturing over 340 personnel, including the deputy commander of the county brigade and lower ranks. The remaining enemy fled south, and the city was thus recovered. Our forces pursued the victory, reaching Qianchen Village, five miles west of the Yellow River Iron Bridge. At 4:00 PM on the 17th, the Liberation Army advanced towards Daiwangzhen, and the defending enemy fled in panic, only to fall into our encirclement. Lu Jiayu, the captain of the Xiuwu puppet security regiment and captain of the Henan People's Self-Defense Fifth Brigade, along with 600 others, including local despots and members of the "Homecoming Corps", and over 500 landlord troops, were all captured. Under the powerful deterrence of the Liberation Army, the Kuomintang troops in Xiuwu abandoned the city and fled on the evening of the 18th. We immediately recovered the city, and intercepted and captured over 50 members of the county security regiment and over 400 members of the landlords' "Homecoming Corps" in Shiziying, east of the city. The Kuomintang troops in Jiaozuo are now completely isolated.

Taihang, this newspaper, 20th—During the counter-offensive operations along the Daokou-Qinghua Railway, the masses in Lingchuan, Bo'ai, Qinyang, and other counties bravely participated in the war. Each member of the Lingchuan First District's support team set out to establish merit plans. Wang Shenghai's group in Shahe Village was transporting grenades when a member, Wang Huaisuo, fell ill. Shenghai left two people to care for him, and he and the remaining two members took on the task originally assigned to six people. Thirty-six women from Huangling Village in Bo'ai Seventh District, led by Wang Guihua, the chairman of the Women's Federation, traveled fifteen miles to Daxinzhuang to feed soup and water to the wounded soldiers, working tirelessly day and night. Primary school students in the Seventh District took excellent care of the wounded soldiers, who gratefully called them "little brothers." Cadres and students in the Qinyang Second District automatically set up a reception center in Wanshan Village to welcome passing soldiers. Four teachers from the Fourth High School led sixteen students to the front lines to carry the wounded.

Taiyue, this newspaper, 21st—The Meng County Independent Battalion in northern Henan cooperated with the regular army in the counter-offensive, acting calmly and flexibly, achieving great victories at a minimal cost. They received a commendation from the Taiyue 20th Military Sub-district for achieving three merits in five days. The battalion actively cooperated with the regular army in both the recovery of Qinyang on the 6th and the capture of Meng County on the 7th. On the 10th, at Jinshan Temple in Meng County, they completely defeated over 300 remnants of Zhang Bohua's troops who had attacked from the Yezhi and Baipo strongholds, killing and wounding over ten enemy troops, including the company commander, and capturing over twenty enemy troops.
