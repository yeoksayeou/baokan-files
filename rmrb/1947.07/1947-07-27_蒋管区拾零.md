　　◇ On June 28th, Nanjing grandiosely held a paratrooper exercise. As a result, only a dozen paratroopers descended from three aircraft, and among them, two paratroopers failed to open their parachutes after leaving the aircraft and fell sharply to the ground. The extent of casualties is being kept strictly secret by the airport authorities. (Xinhua News Agency)
　　◇ On the 23rd, Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang Central Standing Committee approved the appointment of the traitor Tao Xisheng and the secret service chief Li Junlong as deputy ministers of the party's Propaganda Department. Tao defected to the enemy with Wang Jingwei at the end of 1938, and was then secretly sent back to Chongqing the following year. Chiang Kai-shek relied on him very much (Central News Agency). The infamous book "China's Destiny," developed in February 1943 in Chiang Kai-shek's name, was "proofread" by Tao Xisheng (actually written by Tao Xisheng).
　　◇ The Chiang party's recent personnel changes: The pro-American Li Weiguo succeeded Peng Ningpei as the Minister of the Kuomintang Propaganda Department; Gu Zhenglun of the CC clique, the original Minister of Food in the Chiang government, was dismissed and replaced by Yu Feipeng, a fellow townsman of Chiang Kai-shek; Sun Liren, a pro-American general, has been promoted to Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the Ministry of National Defense and concurrently serves as the Commander of the Army Training Command newly established under the Army Headquarters after recently colluding with Chen Cheng to squeeze out Du Yuming.
　　◇ Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed Du Yuming to "go to the United States for medical treatment." After Shen Zhuanping flew to Shanghai, the Central News Agency reported on the 22nd: "It is learned that there is no definite date for Du's departure to go abroad for treatment"; at the same time, the United Press stated that the so-called Du Yuming's illness was a "rumor"; also, when Du Yuming arrived in Beiping on the 20th, he originally wanted to attend the military meeting convened by Chen Cheng in Ping on that day, "but apparently failed to attend" (Associated Press).
　　◇ The Tianjin newspaper reported that the former chief military adviser to Chiang Kai-shek, the fascist war criminal of World War II, the German Fugen Hollin, who was released by the American occupation authorities, recently told a reporter from Chiang's Central News Agency that he was very willing to continue to serve Chiang Kai-shek and missed Chiang Kai-shek very much.
　　◇ Li Liang, the president of Chiang's Shanghai Military Tribunal, was dismissed by Chiang Kai-shek for parading two Japanese invaders, the "Wolf of Changshu" and the "Tiger of Songjiang," before their execution. Li's crime was "damaging the civilization of the ancient country of the East."
　　◇ A "Rice Snatching Notice" was found in the Xiaoqiao area of Fuzhou City: "We can't live anymore! Rice is expensive on sunny days, rice is expensive on rainy days, rice is expensive without rice, rice is expensive with rice. There is rice on the docks, there is rice in the rice shops, why not snatch the rice?" As a result, the whole city was in turmoil.
　　◇ According to Tianjin newspapers, some watermelons shipped from Taiwan to Beiping cost as much as 100,000 yuan each, but they still sold quickly. The poor people starved and stared in grief. Small officials couldn't afford them and couldn't inquire, but the blood-sucking and flesh-eating corrupt officials ate them comfortably to relieve the heat.

　　蒋管区拾零
    ◇六月二十八日南京大吹大擂的举行伞兵演习，结果只有十余伞兵自三架飞机降下，且其中即有两名伞兵出机后，连降落伞都打不开，急剧堕地，伤亡如何，机场方面严守秘密云。（新华社）
    ◇蒋介石国民党中常会于二十三日通过任命汉奸陶希圣及特务头子李俊龙为该党宣传部副部长。陶于一九三八年底随汪精卫投敌，随又于次年被密派返渝，蒋介石对之倚畀甚殷（中央社），一九四三年二月用蒋介石名议发展的遗臭万年的“中国之命运”一书，即系由陶希圣“校对”（实际由陶希圣执笔）。
    ◇蒋党最近一批人事调动：新美派的李惟果继彭宁沛任国民党宣传部长；蒋政府原粮食部长ＣＣ派谷正伦被免职，而代以蒋介石之同乡俞飞鹏；亲美的将领孙立人，在最近勾结陈诚排挤杜聿明之后，已被擢升为国防部陆军副总司令，兼任新设立的陆军总司令部陆军训练司令。
    ◇杜聿明被蒋介石电令“赴美疗疾”，由沈转平飞沪后，中央社二十二日电称：“据悉杜氏出国治病无确期”；同时合众社称，所谓杜聿明生病之说，乃是“谣传”；又杜聿明于二十日飞抵北平时，原想参加是日陈诚在平召开之军事会议，“但显然未能出席”（美联社）。
    ◇津报载：蒋介石前首席军事顾问、第二次世界大战法西斯战犯、被美占领当局释放之德国福根霍林，近对蒋记中央社记者表示，渠甚愿为蒋介石继续服务，并怀念蒋介石不已。
    ◇蒋记上海军事法庭庭长李良，因审判日本两侵华战犯“常熟之狼”及“松江之虎”执行死刑前游街，已被蒋介石下令撤职。李之罪名为“有损东方古国之文明”。
    ◇福州市区小桥一带发现“抢米通告”：“我们是活不了啦！晴天米贵，雨天米贵，无米亦贵，有米亦贵，码头上有米，米店里有米，为什么不去抢米？”因之闹得满市不安。
    ◇据津报载：由台湾运到北平西瓜若干，每个价十万元之高，但是还卖的很快，穷人们饿着肚皮瞪着眼悲叹，小官员买不起无法问津，但吸人血吃人肉的贪官污吏们倒吃的舒舒服服的消暑。
