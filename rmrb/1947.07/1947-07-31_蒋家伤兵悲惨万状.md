Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 29th: According to Chiang Kai-shek's 71st Army prisoners, the Qianjin Railway Hospital in Shenyang is packed with severely and lightly wounded soldiers, one after another. Doctors and nurses only occasionally visit once or twice. Most of the soldiers' wounds have festered, and screams can be heard along the street. Some seriously wounded soldiers' gauze has sunken into purple-red, decaying flesh because it has not been changed for a long time. When someone passes by, flies swarm up from the dense wounds. The mortality rate of wounded soldiers is very high. In a wounded soldier hospital near Yongxing Renji Commercial Firm alone, 300 corpses of wounded soldiers have been carried out since late June. Some wounded soldiers, unable to bear the pain, strangled themselves with ropes; others, afraid of returning to the front lines, used wooden wedges to puncture their wounds when they were about to recover.

In addition, according to a letter to the editor from Liang Shiying of Xi'an, a relative of a deceased anti-Japanese Nationalist Army lieutenant colonel and deputy regimental commander, recently published in Shanghai's Ta Kung Pao: "The remains of many anti-Japanese martyrs are still exposed in the wilderness, their descendants have become destitute, and their wives and children are wandering and helpless." Liang said that after his father died in battle, his mother and he were impoverished and sold all the clothes and miscellaneous items in the house. The Chiang government nominally gives a small amount of compensation, nominally based on the compensation for a colonel one rank higher, only giving 120,000 yuan in pensions and 7.2 shi of grain per year. Last year, according to the price of grain in Xi'an, each dou was converted to 600 yuan to be paid as a substitute. This year, the price of grain is 17,000 yuan per dou, about 30 times higher, but the substitute is still paid according to last year's regulations. Liang said with grief and indignation: "What kind of consolation is this! What kind of relief is this!"

　　蒋家伤兵悲惨万状
    【新华社东北二十九日电】据蒋军七十一军俘虏谈称：沈阳前潜铁医院的大楼里，一个挨一个挤满了轻重伤号，医生护士只偶尔去一两次，伤兵们的伤口大部已经化脓，惨叫之声沿街可闻。有的重伤因久未换药，纱布已陷入紫红的腐肉里，有人经过时，密集伤口的苍蝇哄然飞起。伤兵的死亡率很高，仅永兴仁记商号附近一处伤病院，六月下旬以来即已抬出三百余俱伤兵尸体。有的伤兵因不堪痛苦，用绳带把自己勒死；有的怕再上前线，快要痊愈时又用木楔将伤口戳破。
    又据沪大公报近载抗日阵亡的蒋军中校副团长遗族西安梁士瀛之投书称：“许多抗日阵亡父兄的尸骨还暴露荒野，他们的后代都变得家破人亡，妻子儿女则飘流无依。”梁说：他的父亲阵亡后，母子二人家贫如洗，把家里的衣服杂物都卖光了。蒋政府在名义上给一点抚恤，还是号称按晋一级的上校级抚恤，每年仅给恤金十二万，恤粮七石二斗，且在去年按西安粮价规定每斗折合六百元发代金，今年粮价每斗一万七，约涨三十倍，仍按去年规定发给代金。梁悲愤的说：“这算抚了什么！恤了什么！”
