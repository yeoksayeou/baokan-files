Learning from the "Female Top Scorer"
	Qin County Launches Li Guixiang Movement
[This newspaper, Taiyue, 16th dispatch] Qin County has established a banner for women's labor and launched the women's labor hero Li Guixiang movement. Li Guixiang is from Kai Village, 32 years old. She has always been active in work and production. If she doesn't have to take care of children or cook, she can spin twelve liang of cotton per day. She can also work in the fields, carrying water, carrying manure, driving carts, plowing, weeding, and harvesting, doing everything as well as a good head of household. Therefore, the villagers call her a "civil and military top scorer." Last year, when her husband was too sick to move, she single-handedly planted not only her family's fourteen mu of land but also helped others plant three mu. She often worked in the fields during the day and brought back firewood on the way. She wove cloth at night and got up to spin cotton before dawn. Last year, she spun thirteen jin of cotton and sold it for thirteen pairs of shoes, not including the shoes her family wore and military shoes. Her total production for the year, besides covering the food, clothing, and all other expenses for her family of four, also allowed her to buy one-third of a donkey with two shi and eight dou of rice and wheat. Her production plan for this year is to plant seventeen mu of land herself while also doing housework. Her husband works as a long-term laborer, with two-thirds of his earnings going to support their eldest son, Shanqing, who is in "Min Gao" [People's Higher Primary School]. Her relationship with her husband is also very good, and she often helps neighbors pull manure and weed. Neighbors nearby all say she has a "good heart," and women of all ages are willing to learn from her. Deyi's family, Guichang's family, and Mao Er's family often sit at her home when they have nothing to do. Now they have organized a mutual aid group to spin cotton together. The district office has awarded her a glorious certificate as a "civil and military double top scorer." County Magistrate Xiao has called on all women in the county to learn from Li Guixiang and the song "Launch the Women's Labor Hero Li Guixiang Movement" has spread throughout the county.

    学习“女状元”
    沁县开展李贵香运动
    【本报太岳十六日电】沁县已树立起妇女劳动旗帜，开展妇女劳动英雄李贵香运动。李贵香是开村人，三十二岁，她一贯积极干事，劳动生产，如果不带孩子连做饭每天能纺十二两花，又能上地，担水、担粪、赶车、犁地、锄苗、收割样样都能顶个好受家，所以村人称她为文武状元。去年男人病得不能动，她一个人除种了家里十四亩地外，还帮旁人种了三亩。她经常白天上地劳动，回来捎带闹柴。夜里织布，天不明就起来纺花。去年纺花十三斤，卖了十三双鞋，家里人穿的和军鞋尚不在内，全年生产除全家四口人吃穿及其他一切费用外，还用两石八斗米麦买了三分之一的毛驴。今年她的生产计划，是自己种地十七亩兼做家里活，她男人住长工，以三分之二供给大儿善青住“民高”。她和她男人的关系也很好，还常帮助邻家拉粪锄草，附近邻家都说她“好心肠”，老少女人都愿向她学习，德义家、贵昌家、毛二家没事就到她家坐，现在她们已组织起互助组纺花。区公所已发给了她“文武双状元”的光荣奖状，肖县书号召全县妇女，向李贵香学习，“开展女劳动英雄李贵香运动”的歌，已唱遍了全县。
