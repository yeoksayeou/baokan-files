Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. TASS Moscow dispatch: The "Socialist Agriculture Newspaper" published an article on the 18th by Kharkov on the land reform in Manchuria, praising the achievements of the land reform in the Northeast Liberated Areas. The article stated: Land reform in Manchuria has been gradually implemented since the spring of last year. A large amount of the most fertile land formerly belonging to the Japanese "Development Company" or Japanese private landlords and Chinese landlords has been distributed to landless and land-poor peasants. According to materials obtained from visits to the five provinces of Manchuria in March 1947, 5.5 million landless and land-poor peasants have obtained land. By the end of last year, 35 million mu of land had been distributed to peasants. Farmers' associations have been organized in various villages to protect the interests of the peasants. In the process of land reform, farmers' associations in various places have united more than 3 million peasants. The Northeast Administrative Committee, through these farmers' associations, helps farmers with farm implements, seeds, and farming power. Poor peasants have received loans of 500 million yuan. However, the situation is completely different in the areas controlled by the Kuomintang. In the areas occupied by the Kuomintang army last year, all democratic reforms were eliminated. Former landlords returned to the villages with the army and rebuilt their old rule. The land formerly held by the Japanese was declared the property of the Kuomintang government and leased out under conditions of enslavement.

　　苏社会主义农业报盛赞东北土地改革
    【新华社陕北二十日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：十八日“社会主义农业报”发表哈尔科夫所作论满洲土地改革一文，盛赞东北解放区土改成绩。该文称：满洲土地改革，自去年春季起，即已逐渐实行。曾属于日本“开拓会社”或日本私人地主及中国地主的大量最肥沃的土地，已被分与无地和少地的农民。根据一九四七年三月访问满洲五省所得的材料，已有五百五十万无地和少地的农民获得了土地。至去年年底，已有三千五百万亩土地分给农民。各村都组织了农会，以保护农民的利益。在土地改革的过程中，各地农会已团结了三百万以上的农民。东北行政委员会通过这些农会，帮助农民农具，种籽和耕作动力。贫农已获得五亿元之贷款。但国民党控制的地区，情况则完全不同，去年被国民党军攻占的地区，一切民主改革都被清除了。从前的地主随着军队又回到村里，重建其旧统治。从前日本人手中的土地，被宣布是国民党政府的财产，而以奴役的条件出租。
