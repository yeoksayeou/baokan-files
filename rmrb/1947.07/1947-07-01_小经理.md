　　Little Manager
　　Zhao Shuli
　　The little manager is called Sanxi, and he is the manager of the village cooperative. There are three reasons for calling him "little": first, he is young, only twenty-three years old; second, it is a small cooperative in a small village, with only one manager and one treasurer; third, the treasurer Wang Zhong looks down on him—when someone seeks the treasurer to discuss business matters, the treasurer often says: "I'm not very clear, I'll ask our little manager when he gets back." After saying that, he sticks out his tongue and makes a face.
　　Sanxi has been a clever child since he was little, fond of doing ingenious things: during the New Year and festivals, he builds colorful sheds and pastes paper lanterns, playing better than others; he speaks and composes songs with ease, very skillfully; he understands everything at a glance, and he can fill in for carpenters, stonemasons, and blacksmiths: the villagers say he is a "jack of all trades." Because his family is poor, he has not attended school since he was a child and is illiterate. When he grows up, he is unwilling to accept this, and he likes to ask people about characters, and he has learned a lot. However, there are too many characters, and learning them is different from learning other things. He asks around, and he has learned several hundred characters, but when he opens a book, the characters he knows are not concentrated, and he can't find a few on one page: this is the thing he is most dissatisfied with.
　　Sanxi joined the Communist Party only three days earlier than when he became the manager. This village is a natural village, with only four party members, which is considered a group, attached to the village branch of the administrative village. In August, the village held a struggle meeting to struggle against the old manager of the cooperative, Zhang Tai. Sanxi contributed a lot, and the branch admitted him as a party member.
　　Originally, Zhang Tai started by lending money at high interest rates. Before the War of Resistance, he opened a small grocery store in the village. Saying "grocery store" was just a name, often lacking what people needed, and the things sold were half as expensive as those in the market, so no one bought them. Zhang Tai didn't make money by selling goods at all, but by lending money. The poor people in the village had to send interest to his shop in the autumn and summer and at the end of the year. When the poor people talked about their family affairs, they said: "Poverty is poverty in that small shop, and our family property is slowly sent to other people's homes." During the War of Resistance, Zhang Tai saw that the situation was not right, closed the door, only collected and did not lend, and in a few months, he collected all the debts that could be collected. In 1942, when rent reduction and interest reduction were implemented, Zhang Tai only had some uncollectible accounts left, gave an empty favor, saying "principal and interest are all waived," and some people thought he was very enlightened and asked him to be the manager of the village cooperative. After he became the manager, his family's share capital was more than the share capital of the whole village, and the business seemed to be his family's again. He only did profitable business, and the villagers still couldn't get what they needed. The villagers were dissatisfied with this matter for several years, until it was overturned again last August. After this matter was overturned, Sanxi couldn't sleep, and he was looking for cadres and masses; mobilizing east and mobilizing west; searching for materials and finding evidence; reasoning and shouting slogans; he was there every day, and he was there in every event. After Zhang Tai was overthrown, the Communist Party's group leader reported Sanxi's active activities to the branch, and the branch sent this group leader to talk to him about joining the party. As soon as this group leader talked to him, he said, "Wasn't I already in it?" The group leader thought that someone else had already introduced him, so he asked him, "Who talked to you?" He said, "Didn't I already fight Zhang Tai?" The group leader said, "How can fighting Zhang Tai be considered joining the party?" He said, "Isn't getting rid of feudalism the Communist Party's proposition? Doing things according to the Communist Party's proposition, how can it not be considered a Communist Party member?" When the group leader heard him say this, he knew that he had misunderstood, and he explained to him how to be considered joining the party. After the explanation, he asked him if he wanted to join, and he said, "Join, join, join, after struggling for so long, it's not okay if I'm not even a Communist Party member, right?"
　　"The public is a sage." Since Sanxi participated in this struggle, the Communist Party has looked up to him, and the masses have also looked up to him. Once Zhang Tai fell, the cooperative had to elect a new manager. The first night when the matter of electing a manager was mentioned, almost everyone thought of Sanxi. When the meeting opened the next day, it was like a decision before even discussing it. When Sanxi saw this situation, his head seemed to swell as big as a willow dipper, waving his hands and saying, "No way," but he couldn't resist everyone's "support." He said, "I'm illiterate," and everyone said, "Everyone is illiterate"; he said, "My wife and I are just living our own lives, and we really don't have time," and everyone said, "Everyone will help you with production"; he had nothing more to say.
　　Saying "illiterate" and saying "no time" are just superficial statements. In fact, he was afraid that he would not be able to use Wang Zhong, the treasurer. Wang Zhong was in the same gang as Zhang Tai, serving Zhang Tai for half his life (from Zhang Tai opening a lending shop to later becoming the manager of the cooperative, Wang Zhong was the treasurer). The villagers said that Zhang Tai was Yan Song and Wang Zhong was Zhao Wenhua. This time when Zhang Tai was struggled against, Wang Zhong was also slightly affected, but the business was Zhang Tai's, and he didn't have any share capital. He was just wearing black clothes to protect the black master, offending many people along with Zhang Tai, and he didn't get anything himself. Therefore, everyone only asked him to reflect on himself, without touching his property, and even asked him to be the treasurer of the cooperative. Although everyone decided this way, Sanxi's thoughts couldn't turn around for a while, and he didn't want to work with this "Zhao Wenhua." Furthermore, Sanxi himself didn't understand business, and he had to ask Wang Zhong for advice, and he was afraid of being tricked by Wang Zhong, so he didn't dare to take this job.
　　After everyone elected him, he went to the branch to raise difficulties. The branch said, "Since the masses want you to be the manager, you should overcome difficulties and set a model." He said, "I can't do it." The branch said, "Who do you think is more capable than you?" He thought for a while, and there was no one. He said, "I'm afraid I won't get along with Wang Zhong." The branch said, "You can hire whoever you think is suitable. The manager has this right." He thought for a while, and there was no one—there were too few literate people in the village, and there was only Wang Zhong who had done other work. After talking for a long time, he still had to work with Wang Zhong himself.
　　As soon as Sanxi took office, Wang Zhong really made things difficult for him. Wang Zhong's thoughts couldn't turn around either: First, although he had reflected on himself, he only did it as a formality, without thinking that Zhang Tai's gains and his offending people were a bad deal—he didn't think that he had been Zhang Tai's dog for half his life, but only felt that Zhang Tai was his master, and he would be sorry for Zhang Tai if he fell. But he was also afraid that the masses would say that he was still in the same gang as Zhang Tai, so he didn't dare not to do it, but he was really full of dissatisfaction. Second, he felt that he was a million times stronger than Sanxi. Now that Sanxi was the manager and he was the treasurer, he was really not convinced, and he always wanted to see Sanxi's jokes. On the day Sanxi took office, he asked him to settle and hand over the previous period. This was originally very easy for him, but he refused to settle according to the usual settlement method, and asked Sanxi to make suggestions on everything. Sanxi said what goods to count, and he counted what goods; Sanxi said to calculate which account, and he calculated which account. Sanxi was still a smart person, and he thought of almost all the items that should be thought of, and the settlement was still about the same, but he was not skilled in the procedures, and he wasted several times more work.
　　He felt that Wang Zhong was really difficult to deal with, and he told the branch several times. The branch told him to persuade and educate him slowly. But heavens! How could Wang Zhong take his words to heart? He really worried about this matter for a few days. Later, he thought that he could only make Wang Zhong honest if he was familiar with the cooperative, so he paid attention to everything. After a month or two, he also figured out a lot, but it was a pity that he was too illiterate, and he still had to rely entirely on Wang Zhong for the accounts.
　　If he wanted to learn accounts, he had to learn from Wang Zhong. He wanted to say this to Wang Zhong, but Wang Zhong wanted to put on airs even more, so he decided not to lose face in front of Wang Zhong, and secretly learned by opening the account book when Wang Zhong was not there. Wang Zhong slept at home at night. Every night after checking the accounts and counting the money, he locked the door and went back. He felt that this was a good opportunity, so he told Wang Zhong that the cooperative could not be without someone at night, and he wanted to stay inside to watch the door. Wang Zhong handed him the key. He thought that after Wang Zhong went back every night, he would close the door and open the account book to study. Because he had paid attention during the day, he could slowly figure out some truth at night. For example, if he entered 125 catties of salt during the day, he could find the code for 125 catties at night, and he could slowly find out which one was the character "salt." At first, he was just recognizing characters and understanding the principles of accounts, and later he slowly learned to write—writing the characters in the account book on the water plate, writing until it was full, then erasing it, and writing again. He often didn't sleep in the middle of the night.
　　One night, he was practicing the character "sauce" on the water plate, writing "sauce" on half of the water plate, when someone knocked on the door outside. He opened the door and a woman ran in. It was his wife. He asked, "What are you doing here in the middle of the night?" His wife said, "I'm here to find you! Why don't you go back during the day, and why don't you go back at night? Is there nothing to do at home?" He said, "What's the matter? What are you missing at home?" His wife said, "Nothing is missing! Except you!" He said, "Don't make trouble! Go back quickly! I still have something to do!" His wife was a young woman, and she didn't listen to him. She just shouted at him, "No! If you don't go back tonight, I won't leave!" As she spoke, she went to grab the pen in his hand. He held the pen high and smiled and said, "I can't take care of going back. If you don't leave, won't you stay too?" He was just joking, but his wife said to him without reservation, "You think I don't dare? I'll stay if I stay. There's no one else inside!" As she spoke, she lay down on his bed, sulking and saying, "I'm not leaving!" He had no choice but to close the door; but the character "sauce" hadn't been learned well, so he sat down and wrote again, writing until it was almost the same as Wang Zhong's writing before he slept.
　　In half a year, he learned almost all the characters used in the account book. With a bottom in his heart, his speech became a little harder, and he accommodated Wang Zhong a little less. Wang Zhong was a little unhappy, so he pretended to be sick and didn't come to the cooperative for three consecutive days. On the fourth day, he went to see Wang Zhong. He knew that the illness was fake, but he comforted him a bit, saying, "Take care of yourself slowly, don't worry. I'll take care of the cooperative's affairs for a few days!" Wang Zhong saw that he wasn't anxious, and he didn't understand why. He thought, "I'll pretend for half a month and see what you do!" But after pretending for half a month, he didn't see Sanxi get anxious, and he couldn't hold back himself. He swayed to the cooperative to take a look.
　　As soon as Wang Zhong entered the cooperative, Sanxi pretended to be very serious and said, "Are you feeling better? I've been too busy these days to visit you!" He also said a few polite words and sat down. As soon as he sat down, he wanted to see what jokes Sanxi had made in the accounts in the past half month. He picked up the cash flow journal, and Sanxi said, "Take a rest, don't worry! You've only gotten a little better, beware of getting tired!" When he saw this book, he was shocked. He saw that not only were there not many wrong characters in this book, but also those very complicated account principles of exchanging grain for goods, cash and credit... none of them were wrong; he flipped through several other books, and they were all the same. If there was any difference from himself, it was just that the characters were not written skillfully enough. At this moment, he felt that he would never dare to bargain again in the future. If he made trouble again, he would have to get out, and he would never have anything to do again (the manager of this cooperative is an unpaid position, but the treasurer is a salaried position). He hesitated for a long time before saying tentatively, "I've troubled you for half a month because of my illness. I'm very anxious, but I can't help it because I'm sick. I'm feeling better now, I'll move over tomorrow!" Sanxi still said to him very seriously, "See for yourself! Don't force yourself, your health is important!"
　　From then on, Wang Zhong was really honest: whatever Sanxi told him to do was the same as Zhang Tai telling him in the past, there was no price to negotiate; every month, before Sanxi spoke, he would first calculate what should be settled... Seeing that he had changed, Sanxi became even more polite to him, and he also felt more comfortable than when he was under Zhang Tai.
　　Sanxi reported the matter of reforming Wang Zhong to the branch. It happened to be when the branch was carrying out the merit campaign, so he was given a major merit.

　　小经理
    赵树理
    小经理叫三喜，是村里合作社的经理。说他“斜，有三个原因：第一是他的年纪小，才二十三岁；第二是小村子的小合作社，只有一个经理和一个掌柜；第三是掌柜王忠瞧不起他——有人找掌柜谈什么生意里边的问题，掌柜常好说：“不很清楚，回来问一问俺那小经理。”说了就吐一吐舌头做个鬼脸。
    这三喜从小就是个伶俐孩子，爱做个巧活：过年过节，搭个彩棚，糊个花灯，比别人玩得高；说个话，编个歌，都是出口成章，非常得劲；什么活一看就懂，木匠、石匠、铁匠缺了人他都能配手：村里人都说他是“百家子弟”。因为家穷，从小没有念过书，不识字，长大了不甘心，逢人便好问个字，也认了好多。不过字太多了，学起来跟学别的不一样，他东问西问，数起数来也认了好几百，可是一翻开书，自己认得的那些字都不集中，一张上碰不到几个：这是他最不满意的一件事。
    三喜入共产党，只比他当经理早三天。这村是个自然村，只有四个党员，算是一小组，附在行政村的村支部。八月间，村里开斗争会，斗争合作社的旧经理张太，三喜出力不小，支部就把他收为党员。
    原来这张太是个放高利贷起家的，抗战以前在村里开了个小杂货铺。说“杂货铺”只是个名，常是要啥没啥，卖的东西比集市上贵一半，没人买。张太根本不凭卖货赚钱，就凭的是放债。村里的穷人们，一到秋夏季和年关，都得到他铺里去送利，穷人们谈起家常话来，都说：“穷就穷到那小铺子里，把咱的家当慢慢都给人家送进去了。”一到抗战时期，张太看见风头不对，把门一关，光收不放，几个月的工夫就把收得动的债都收回去。一九四二年实行减租减息，张太就只剩了一些收不起来的账尾巴，送了个空头人情，说“本利全让”，有些人还以为人家很开明，叫人家当本村合作社经理。人家当了经理以后，光人家一家的股本比一村人的股还多，生意好象又成了人家的，人家拣赚钱的买卖干，村里人仍是要啥没啥。村里人对这事不满意了好几年，直到去年八月才又翻起来。翻起这事来以后，三喜连觉也睡不着，又是找干部，又是找群众；发动东家，发动西家；搜材料，找证据；讲道理，喊口号；天天有他，场场有他。赶斗倒了张太，共产党的小组长把三喜的积极活动情形报告了支部，支部就派这小组长去和他谈入党的话。这小组长才跟他一谈，他说：“不是早就入了吗？”小组长还只当是别人已经介绍了他，就问他“是谁跟你谈的？”他说：“我不是已经斗过张太了吗？”小组长说：“门张太怎么就算入了党？”他说：“搞翻身不是共产党的主张吗？照着共产党的主张做事，怎么还不算共产党？”小组长听他这么一说，知道他了解错了，才给他解释怎样才能算入党。解释完了问他入不入，他说：“入入入，斗争了这么一回，连个共产党员也不算还行呀？”
    “众人是圣人”。三喜自参加了这次斗争，共产党看起他来了，群众也看起他来了。张太一倒，合作社就得补选经理。头一天晚上提起选经理这事，每个人差不多都想到三喜身上，第二天一开会，还没有讨论，就跟决定了一样。三喜一看这风色，一颗头好象涨得有柳斗大，摆着两只手说：“不行”，可是也抵抗不住大家的“拥护”。他说：“我不识字”，大家说：“都不识字”；他说：“我两口人过个日子，实在没工夫”，大家说：“大家帮你生产”；他再没有说的。
    说“不识字”，说“没工夫”，都只是表面上一个说法，实际上是他怕使用不了王忠这个掌柜。王忠这个人跟张太是一伙，伺候了张太半辈子（从张太开放债铺到后来当合作社经理，都是王忠当掌柜），村里人说张太是严嵩王忠是赵文华。这次斗张太，也捎带了王忠一下，不过生意是张太的，没有他的股本，他也只是穿黑衣保黑主，跟着张太得罪了许多人，自己也没落下个什么，因此大家只叫他反省了一下，没有动他的产业，还叫他当合作社掌柜。大家虽是这样决定了，三喜的思想上一时转不过弯来，总不想跟这“赵文华”共事。再者三喜自己也不懂生意，又要向王忠领教，又怕受王忠的捉弄，因此不敢领这个盘。
    大家推选他来以后，他去向支部提出困难，支部说：“群众既要你当，你就该克服困难，起模范作用。”他说：“我干不了”，支部说：“你看谁比你能干？”他想想，没有。他说：“恐怕跟王忠合不来”，支部说：“你看换上谁合适就可以聘请谁。当经理有这个权。”他想想，也没有——村里识字的太少，没有干过别的工作的，还只有一个王忠。说了半天，还得自己跟王忠干。
    三喜一上了任，王忠果然跟他掉蛋。在王忠，思想上也转不过弯来：第一、他虽作过了反省，可是只作了个样子，没有想到张太得利他惹人是件不合算的事——没有想到他是给张太当了半辈子狗，只是觉着张太是他家的主人，张太倒了他再干下去对不住张太，可是又怕群众说他仍然跟张太是一伙，又不敢不干，干着却实在是一肚子不满。第二、他觉着他自己要比三喜强一万倍，如今叫三喜当经理他当掌柜，实在有点不服贴，总想看三喜的笑话。三喜上任这一天，叫他把以前那一段结算结算，交代一下。这在他本来是极容易的事，可是他偏不按平常结算的办法来结算，事事叫三喜出主意。三喜说点什么货，他就点什么货；三喜说算那宗帐，他就算那宗帐。三喜总算是聪明人，应想到的项目差不多也都想到了，结算得也还差不多，只是手续上不熟练，磨了好几倍的洋工。
    他觉着王忠这人果然不好对付，跟支部说了几回，支部叫他慢慢说服教育。可是天呀！王忠那能把他的话放在心里呢？他为这事着实发了几天愁，后来想着只有把合作社这一套弄熟了，才能叫王忠老实一点，从此便事事留心，有个把月工夫，却也摸着了好多，只可惜自己识字太少，帐本上还得完全靠王忠。
    要学帐，就得跟王忠学。他想要跟王忠说这话，王忠越发要拿一拿架子，因此他决定不在王忠面前丢这人，等王忠不在的时候，自己翻开帐本偷偷的学。王忠晚上在家里睡，每天晚上过了帐点了钱，就把门一锁回去了。他觉着这是个好机会，就跟王忠说合作社晚上不可没人，自己要到里边看门，王忠就把钥匙交了他。他当王忠每天晚上回去之后，就关起门来翻开帐本研究，因为白天留过心，晚上还能慢慢看出点道理来。比方说白天入了一百二十五斤盐，晚上找着了一百二十五斤这个码，就能慢慢找出那一个是“盐”字来。起先只是认字和了解帐理，后来又慢慢学着写——把帐本上的字写到水牌上，写满了就擦，擦了又写，常是半夜半夜不睡觉。
    有一晚上，他正在水牌上练习一个“酱”字，写了半水牌“酱”，有人在外边打门，开开门跑进个女人来，是他老婆。他问“你半夜三更来做什么？”老婆说：“来找你！你怎么白天白天不回去，晚上晚上不回去？家里就没有事了吗？”他说：“有什么事？家里少你的什么？”老婆说：“什么也不少！就是少你！”他说：“不要闹！快回去吧！我还有事啦！”老婆是个年轻娃娃，不听他的，只是跟他嚷：“不！今天晚上你不回去我就不走！”说着就去夺他手里的笔。他把笔举得高高的笑着说：“我是顾不上回去，你不走不会也住下？”他本来是说玩话，老婆可不客气的跟他说：“你说我不敢？住下就住下，里边又没别人！”说着就躺到他床上，赌气说：“不走了！”他没法，只好关住门；可是“酱”字还没学好，又坐上写起来，直写到和王忠写得差不多才睡。
    半年工夫，帐本上用的那几个字他学了个差不多。心里有了底，说话就硬一点，对王忠迁就得就少一点。王忠有点不高兴，就装起病来，一连三天没到合作社。到了第四天，他去看王忠，明知道病是装的，却也安慰了一番，说：“你慢慢养着吧，不要着急，合作社的事情我暂且招呼几天！”王忠见他不发急，也没明其妙，心想“我且装上半个月，看你怎么办？”可是真正装了半月，也不见三喜发急，自己反而沉不住气，摇摇摆摆到合作社去看。
    王忠一进合作社，三喜装得很正经的说：“好些了吗？这几天忙得也没顾上去看你！”他也客气了几句就坐下了。他一坐下就想看看三喜这半月来在帐上闹了些什么笑话，顺手翻开了流水帐，三喜还说：“你歇歇吧，不要着急！才好了些，防备劳着了！”他一看这本帐先吃了一惊。他看见这帐上不止没有多少错字，连那些粮食换货物，现钱和赊欠……一切很复杂的帐理，一项也没有弄错；又翻了翻另外几本，也都一样，要说跟自己有差别的话，只是字写得没有工夫些。这一下他觉着以后再不敢讲价钱了，再要掉蛋就得滚蛋，滚出去便再没有个干的了（这合作社的经理是义务职，掌柜却是薪水制）。他踌蹰了半天，才搭讪着说：“我这一病就累了你半月，心里急得很，只是病到身上由不得人。这会才算好了，我明天搬来吧！”三喜仍然很正经的跟他说：“你看吧！不敢勉强，身体要紧！”
    自此以后，王忠果然老实了：三喜吩咐他干啥，也跟从前张太吩咐下来一样，没有什么价钱可讲；每到一个月头上，不等三喜说话就先把应结算的算出来………三喜见他转变了，对他反而又客气好多，他也觉着比在张太手下还痛快。
    三喜把改造王忠这事报告支部，恰是支部搞立功运动的时候，就给他记了一大功。
