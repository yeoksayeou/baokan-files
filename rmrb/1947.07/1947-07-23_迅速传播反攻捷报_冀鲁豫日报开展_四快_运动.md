　　Rapidly Spreading News of the Counter-Offensive Victories
  　"Four Quicks" Campaign Launched by the Ji-Lu-Yu Daily
    [This newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu dispatch from the 20th] In order to rapidly disseminate news of the counter-offensive victories and enhance the timeliness of the Party newspaper, the Ji-Lu-Yu Daily has launched a "Four Quicks" campaign: Quick editing, quick printing, quick distribution, and quick delivery. Since July 6th, the editorial department has guaranteed the editing of news from the same day, and the factory ensures that the newspapers are completely delivered to the distribution section before 12:00 noon. The distribution section delivers them immediately upon receipt, ensuring delivery to the post office before 3:00 PM. The post office line stations have added a night shift, delivering immediately upon arrival without delay, ensuring that the newspaper never stops. In the past week, significant results have been achieved. Today's newspaper can be seen with yesterday's news, and the printing factory's typesetting speed has also been reduced from twelve hours to six hours. Today's newspapers can be seen within a 150-mile radius. Currently, the "Four Quicks" campaign is being expanded to all relevant departments.
