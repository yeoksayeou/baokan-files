Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 26th: The East China People's Liberation Army (PLA) is taking advantage of lulls in the fighting to enthusiastically study tactics and the art of command, preparing to make great contributions to the people in the new campaign. The sand table exercises of the famous Guo Jisheng Company have been widely adopted by various battalions. Li, the battalion commander of the Second Battalion, is spending his days rushing to make maps and sand tables, leading all the battalion's cadres in studying tactics for capturing fortresses and pillboxes, and engaging in heated debates. The First Battalion is more profoundly conveying and discussing the newspaper's editorial "Combining Bravery and Wit, Combining Command and the Masses." Yan, the battalion commander of the battalion, gathered all cadres above squad level in the battalion to study his hand-made sixteen-square-meter complex sand table fortifications, starting from the position of a single assault squad and a hand cannon or machine gun, down to every subtle movement of breakout or street fighting, how to arrange and conduct combat, all of which were dissected and studied one by one. The Guo Jisheng Company's various squad and platoon groups are constantly setting up fortifications on the ground, hypothesizing situations, and commanding combat. According to the deputy political instructor of the battalion, the current upsurge of tactical study in the troops has enabled cadres at all levels to further master the organization of firepower and the organization of troops. The instructor's responsibilities and position in combat have become clearer, and they have learned more about summarizing and improving command experience.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 26th: Yang Jiaqing, a "hundred-step piercing willow" super marksman, appeared in the Second Battalion of a certain regiment of the East China PLA during an exercise to storm a fortified position. Yang is a machine gunner in the Fifth Company of the battalion. At that time, the instructor pointed to a branch about 25 centimeters in circumference on a tree 150 meters away and ordered Yang to shoot at it. Yang calmly fired two bursts of "da da", making two holes in the branch, followed by three bursts of rapid fire, all of which passed through the same hole. The soldiers were mesmerized. The instructor then asked Yang Jiaqing, "Are you confident in hitting the gun emplacement of a stone bunker more than 150 meters away?" He confidently replied, "Yes!" So the instructor designated a gun emplacement fifteen centimeters wide and ten centimeters high. Yang calmly fired three shots. The first shot hit the center of the upper edge of the gun emplacement, and the remaining two shots passed through the hole. The division and regimental leaders on the side also praised him. In the previous Battle of Menglianggu, Yang Jiaqing played a significant role in blocking the reinforcement of Chiang Kai-shek's 65th Division on the Tianmashan line, and he received a commendation for his meritorious service. According to Yang, "Technique depends on hard training. The most important thing is to be very familiar with the performance of your weapon, its deviation and vibration, all of which must be carefully studied and memorized thoroughly. Usually, you have to protect it like your own body."

　　华东我军加强学习
  　提高指挥技能
  　超等射手杨家清弹不虚发
    【新华社华东前线二十六日电】华东解放军某团利用战斗间隙，热烈钻研战术与指挥艺术，准备在新的战役中，为人民立大功。有名的郭继胜连的沙盘作业，已被各营普遍采用。二营李营长整日赶制地图沙盘，领导全营干部研究夺取要塞和围堡战术，展开热烈争论。一营更深刻传达与讨论该报纸“勇敢与机智结合，指挥与群众结合”的社论。该营阎营长集合全营班以上的干部，研究其手制的十六方米复杂沙盘工事，从一个突击班的队伍和一门手炮或机枪的位置起，直到突围或巷战的每一细微动作，如何布置，如何进行战斗，都一一加以剖解研讨。郭继胜连各个班排小组，更随时在地上摆工事，假设情况，指挥战斗。据该营副政治教导员谈称：目前部队这种钻研战术的热潮，已使各级干部进一步熟练了组织火力，组织部队。指导员在战斗中的责任和位置，已更明确，更学会了总结和提高指挥经验。
    【新华社华东前线二十六日电】华东解放军某团二营在演习攻坚中，出现了“百步穿杨”的超等射手杨家清，杨为该营五连机枪射手。当时教导员指着一百五十米达外一树上二十五公分周围大的一根树枝命杨射击，杨沉着地“哒哒”两发点放，把那根树枝打了两个洞，继以三发快放，又都穿在一个洞里。战士们看得出神了。教导员再向杨家清，“你打一百五十米以外的石碉堡枪眼有没有把握？”他满有信心地回答：“有！”于是教导员指定了一个十五公分阔十公分高的枪眼，杨不慌不忙打了三枪，第一枪打中那枪眼上沿正中后，其余二枪则穿眼而过。师团首长在旁，亦同声赞许。前次孟良崮战役中，杨家清在天马山一线阻击蒋军六十五师的增援，他的机枪起了很大的作用，曾立功一次。据杨谈：“技术要靠苦练。最重要的是要非常熟悉自己的武器的性能，它的偏差与震动，都要仔细研究，记得烂熟。平时要和自己的身体一样保护它。”
