　　Chiang Kai-shek's Propaganda Machine
  　Fails in Anti-Soviet Rumor-Mongering
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th – Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda machine's anti-Soviet rumor-mongering has recently developed to a point where even they themselves are frightened. A Central News Agency dispatch from Changchun on June 30th, in order to conceal the Chiang army's heavy losses in the Siping area, repeated its so-called "Liberation Army borrowing Soviet weapons" assistance rumor, but then immediately felt it was too absurd and feared being questioned and held responsible for spreading rumors, so it quickly sent a correction stating: "Changchun dispatch number 82, please delete 'borrowing Soviet weapons' assistance." It is reported that Chiang Kai-shek has issued an order to his subordinates that, when spreading rumors, they should uniformly use irresponsible terms such as "a certain party" for the purpose of shirking responsibility.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd – According to an Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 29th: The Shanghai Police Bureau of the Chiang government refuses to recognize the Soviet citizenship of the 12,000 Russian émigrés who obtained passports from the Soviet Consulate in Shanghai after the war, on the pretext that they do not have entry passports to China issued by Moscow. The Soviet side has already made representations to the Nanjing government regarding this matter.

　　蒋介石宣传机关
  　反苏造谣破产
    【新华社陕北四日电】蒋介石宣传机关的反苏造谣，近已发展到连自己都害怕的地步。中央社六月三十日长春电，为了掩饰此次四平方面蒋军的惨重损失，又重复其所谓“解放军借苏联武器”之援助的谣言，但随即又觉得太荒唐了，怕被质问时要负造谣的责任，连忙发电更正称：“八十二号长春电，借苏联武器之援助请删去”。据悉：蒋介石已通令所部，在造谣时，一律用某方等类毫不负责的字样，以便推诿。
    【新华社陕北三日电】据合众社二十九日沪讯：蒋政府上海警察局，拒绝承认战后自上海苏联领事馆获得护照的一万二千俄侨之苏联公民籍，其借口为他们没有莫斯科发给进入中国的入境护照。对此苏联方面业已向南京政府提出交涉。
