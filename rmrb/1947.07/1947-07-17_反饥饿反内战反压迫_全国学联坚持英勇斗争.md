Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. Although the All-China Student Federation, established in Shanghai in late June, was declared an "illegal organization" and forcibly disbanded by the Chiang government, it is currently continuing its heroic struggle. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 14th, the All-China Student Federation, in a mimeographed statement distributed to various regions by post, called on students everywhere to rise up against the Chiang government's continued civil war, and put forward the following slogans: "Oppose hunger, fight for survival," "Oppose civil war, fight for peace," "Oppose oppression, fight for freedom." It is reported that the Chiang government's Ministry of Education and Social Affairs is strengthening its suppression of the All-China Student Federation. The Shanghai Chiang Kai-shek Police Bureau and the Bureau of Social Affairs have, based on orders from the Education and Social Affairs departments, notified the Shanghai Newspaper Association to prohibit newspapers from publishing any news or notices related to the All-China Student Federation and the Shanghai Student Federation.

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. TASS, Shanghai, 13th: The Shanghai-based, American-owned, English-language *Millard's Review of the Far East* commented on the Chiang clique's dismissal of a large number of Shanghai professors sympathetic to the student movement, stating: Dismissing professors is a despicable act of revenge and will not improve Chinese university education in any way. If professors are further dismissed, it will inevitably trigger new student actions. Most professors are not affiliated with any political party. They are usually preoccupied with their livelihood and have no time to interfere with school or Ministry of Education affairs. However, when the government (referring to the Chiang clique) treats students with beatings and arrests, it cannot help but arouse their sympathy. Their signing of petitions to the government, demanding that Nanjing remove the perpetrators and military police from the schools, is an expression of compassion. No civilized person can remain indifferent to the sight of military police arresting young men and women students, some only ten years old, late at night, or witness thugs who have been bought off and instructed to beat students with wooden sticks or water pipes without batting an eye.

    反饥饿反内战反压迫
    全国学联坚持英勇斗争
    【新华社陕北十五日电】上月下旬在沪成立之全国学生联合会，虽经蒋政府宣称为“非法组织”强迫解散，但目前仍继续其英勇斗争。据美联社上海十四日电，全国学联由邮局分发各地之油印声明中，呼吁各地同学奋起反对蒋政府继续进行内战，并提出下列斗争口号：“反对饥饿，为生存而战”，“反对内战，为和平而战”，“反对压迫，为自由而战”。据称，蒋政府教育部及社会正加强其对全国学联之压迫，上海蒋记警察局及社会局已根据教育及社会两个命令通知上海报公会，禁止各报刊载一切有关全国学联及上海学联的消息或通知。
    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社上海十三日讯：上海美人主办的英文密勒士评论报对蒋党解聘同情学生运动的上海大批教授发表评论称：解聘教授，是一种卑鄙的报复，决不能对中国大学教育有何改进，若进一步解聘教授，势将引起学生新的行动。一般教授均与任何党派无关，平日困于生活而无暇闻学校或教育部事务，但当政府（指蒋党）用殴打与逮捕手段对待学生时，就不能不激起他们的同情了。他们签署致政府请愿书，要求南京将凶手和宪兵撤离学校，乃恻隐心的表现。没有一个文明人能漠然于宪兵深夜大批逮捕年仅十余岁的男女学生，或目睹被收买指使的流氓以木棒或水管殴击学生而无动于中。
