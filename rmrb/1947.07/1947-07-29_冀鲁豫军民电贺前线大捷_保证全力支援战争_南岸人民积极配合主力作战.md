　　[This newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 27th dispatch] Our army crossing the river has annihilated seven entire enemy brigades in half a month. When the good news arrived, the entire region rejoiced. The Ji-Lu-Yu District Party Committee, Administrative Office, and Military Region, representing the people of the district, sent a telegram to Generals Liu and Deng on the 24th to congratulate them. The original telegram stated:
　　Commander Liu, Political Commissar Deng, and all comrades of the commanders and fighters: Our army's crossing of the Yellow River has terrified the enemy. Wherever the army goes, it advances like a hot knife through butter. Thanks to your wise command and the efforts of all comrades, seven brigades of the enemy have been annihilated in just half a month. The good news has excited and rejoiced all the soldiers and civilians. The vast areas south of Ji-Lu-Yu have been liberated again, and millions of people who were plunged into misery by the Chiang bandits have seen the light of day again. We extend our highest respect to you and all the comrades of the commanders and fighters! We vow to do a good job in the land reform review and war support, and use the powerful strength of the people to support the war. The military and civilians will unite and fight resolutely, thoroughly, decisively, and completely eliminate all invading Chiang troops, end the dark rule of Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial autocracy, and fight to the end for national independence and the complete liberation of the people!
    [This newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 26th dispatch] When our army recovered Dingtao, the local militia heroically cooperated in blocking reinforcements and pursuing fleeing enemies to expand the victory. When our army besieged Dingtao, a part of the enemy's 32nd Division (which had already been annihilated in the Jinju campaign) attempted to reinforce the north along the Shan (County)-Yu (Cheng) and Shan (County)-Dang (Shan) highways. Our Shan (County)-Yu (Cheng)-Hua (Shan)-Dang (Shan) militia, district teams, work groups, and other armed forces ambushed both sides of the highway and laid landmines to block the enemy's advance. This forced the enemy to advance only fifty li in two days on the Shan-Dang highway, providing powerful cooperation to the frontal field army. In the blocking battle, one car and three horse-drawn carriages were captured; and fifty enemy soldiers, including a company commander and below, were killed or wounded. After the capture of Dingtao, a few Chiang soldiers scattered and attempted to escape. However, our Heze, Qibin, and other militias had already set up an impregnable wall to prevent anyone from escaping. Wang Yucheng, a Heze civilian, ambushed in the sorghum fields, and when he saw fleeing Chiang soldiers, he shouted on all sides, "Those who surrender will not be killed!" Using rabbit-catching tactics, they pounced together and captured them. Zhang Tonglian, a work group communications member, captured four Chiang soldiers alive and seized all their personal weapons. According to preliminary statistics, a total of three battalion commanders, two company commanders, and over one hundred and eighty others were captured, along with three light and heavy machine guns and eighty rifles. The Chiang soldiers who fled south were pursued by the Qibin militia. Within two days, more than 300 Chiang soldiers including deputy battalion commanders were captured, along with one mortar, three hand cannons, two heavy machine guns, eleven light machine guns, one hundred rifles, five thousand rounds of ammunition, one telephone, and many other spoils of victory.
