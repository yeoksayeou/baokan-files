　　Village Chiefs and Teachers in the Second District of Jincheng Voluntarily Save and Reduce Salaries

　　[Reported by this newspaper] After the Military Supply First Clothing Factory launched a competition to welcome the counter-offensive, the workers' morale gradually increased. Comrade Shi Guangrong, who cuts the face of cotton military uniforms, increased his daily output from 120 sets to 130 sets. Xu Xiaofang and Cao Xiao, who tailor old pants linings, increased their output from 200 to 300 strips. Five comrades in the cutting group fell ill, which threatened to affect the entire factory's production. When the slogan "Cutting workers do not delay machine workers" was proposed, everyone's morale was boosted, and the entire group still produced the original output. The machine group was even more enthusiastic. Comrades like Lu Jinku and Yuan Eryang, who sew cotton-padded upper garments (replacing old linings), increased their daily output from 20 to 30 pieces. During the production increase competition, everyone was enthusiastic and careful. Comrade Lian Jinfu from the fourth group, who patched old linings, would hold up each one to the window to check it (meaning to see where the cloth was worn out) and patch it up there. The model group proposed: "Do not let a single flaw pass," and the sixth group made its own rules: "Whoever's flaw it is, that person repairs it; whoever breaks a button loses their rice." In the high tide of the competition, a movement to learn well and remember well was launched. The dyeing workshop worked from dawn till dusk, increasing its daily dyeing from 36 pots to 45 pots, an increase of one-quarter. Carrying cloth was all done at a run, vying to be the first to carry large bundles. Comrades Guo Gengwen and Hu Shiming from the calendering room were determined to remember well, spraying each piece of cloth with water to ensure it was calendered flat and stacked neatly. Zhong Tianwang, the cutting group leader, in addition to actively participating in production, carefully figured out using foot-three cloth as the standard and using the large and small sizes separately, saving ten square inches of cloth per set. Currently, all the factory workers are finding ways to learn well and move in the direction of remembering well. (Ge Qin)

　　[Reported from Jincheng by this newspaper] After Yi Zhengwei of the Second District of this county reported the news of the start of the counter-offensive to everyone at the district-wide village cadre meeting on July 16th, the entire audience was excited, and each village successively proposed to immediately rectify the corvée services and have the militiamen and civilian laborers stand by ready to depart and participate in the war. Village Chief Wang Juru of Shangcun Village first proposed that in order to continue to implement production and save, resist drought and prepare for famine with practical actions, it is also necessary to reduce the burden on the masses. He voluntarily reported that he would not eat public grain at all from July 1st, solving it from his own production, and would not affect his work in the slightest. Subsequently, the village chiefs of 23 administrative villages scrambled to voluntarily report that from July 1st, their grain public expenses would be completely self-sufficient. A total of 20 village chiefs voluntarily reported that they would not eat public grain at all from July 1st. Together with Cui Xingchen, the finance and grain director of Bagong, who does not eat public grain, there are a total of 21 village cadres, who can reduce the burden on the masses by four dan and eight dou of rice per month (calculated at four dou per person per month), totaling 616 jin (14 jin per dou).

　　In addition, at the meeting, the primary school teachers in the entire district, in addition to reducing two dou of rice per month as stipulated by the government, also successively proposed to reduce a part of their salary rice to further reduce the burden on the masses and support the front line. Gao Peiji, a teacher from Beigao Village, voluntarily reported that he would contribute one dou of rice per month to support the front line until Chiang Kai-shek was defeated. Teachers from Baiyangping Village even proposed to not eat public grain at all, achieving self-sufficiency through their own production. It is estimated that 20 teachers in the entire district have voluntarily reported, reducing the burden on the masses by one dan and nine dou of rice per month, totaling 226 jin, with public expenses being completely resolved through primary school production.
