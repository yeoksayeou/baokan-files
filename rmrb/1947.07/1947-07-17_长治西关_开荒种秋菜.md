    Reclaims Wasteland to Plant Autumn Vegetables

    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] At the "July 1st" Party Anniversary celebration held in Changzhi City on the fourth of this month, the Municipal Party Committee issued a resounding call to conserve resources in preparation for famine and to support the great counter-offensive. Xiguan in this city was the first to respond to the call. On the 5th and 6th of this month, under the promotion of street leader Ma Keyi and mutual aid group leader Liu Maoze, nine mutual aid groups launched a campaign to reclaim wasteland and plant autumn vegetables. While mobilizing the masses to reclaim wasteland, Liu Maoze said, "We have now begun the counter-offensive, but we still have many difficulties in the counter-offensive. Some areas of the base area have not had rain and are suffering from severe drought. Some areas have not yet been sown. The farmers of the base area are one family. Don't just see that our street is not dry and the crops are growing well and relax your conservation efforts. We don't want people in places where it hasn't rained to eat wild vegetables, so we should conserve, save grain for the long term, and reclaim more wasteland to plant more vegetables." After this mobilization, the masses' thinking became clear. The nine groups organized to reclaim wasteland. Everyone was in high spirits. On the 5th and 6th, they reclaimed a total of 12.1 mu of wasteland. Liu Maoze's group of four people reclaimed more than one mu in one day, and now all of it has been planted with autumn vegetables. In addition, they have also replanted the blank spaces. (Ma Lin)

    长治西关
    开荒种秋菜
    【本报长治讯】长治市在本月四日举行“七一”党生日纪念大会上，市委响亮号召节约备荒，支援大反攻。本市西关首先响应号召，本月五、六两日九个互助组在街长马克义、互助组长刘毛则推动下，发起了开荒种秋菜运动。在动员群众开荒当中，刘毛则说：“咱们现在开始反攻了，但在反攻中咱们还有很多困难，根据地还有些地区没有下雨，旱的很利害，有的地区还未下种，根据地农民是一家，不要光看见咱街里不旱，田禾长的不错就把节约放松了，不要咱在吃面没下雨的地方人们吃野菜，所以咱应该节约，省下粮食长期打算，多开荒多种菜。”经过这一动员，群众思想才通了，九个组组织起来开荒，大家情绪很高，在五、六两日共开荒地十二亩一分。刘毛则组四个人一天就开了一亩多，现在都种上了秋菜，另外还补种了空白地。（马琳）
