　　Opening the Road to Victory
    Liu Guangbin
    Raining, treading through mud, gazing at the firelight in the southeast – the troops advanced towards Goose Duck Factory.
    With the sound of a gunshot, our mortars opened fire, and the Third Battalion advanced into Goose Duck Factory from the due west. By dawn, the entire western part of the village had been occupied by us, and the enemy was trapped in the middle of the village.
    The rain grew heavier.
    In front of the position of the Seventh and Eighth Companies, the enemy charged, and the machine gun of Comrade Hu Youcai of the First Platoon of the Eighth Company chattered away, sending the enemy rolling back into the mud.
    At noon, the sky cleared, and the enemy's arrogance began to decline. Wooden barricades, doors, and wooden sticks filled their surroundings, but what use were they?
    The brigade leader told everyone: "Fire the first shot, open the road to victory, and welcome our main force!"
    At dusk, mountain guns opened fire, recoilless guns destroyed the enemy's walls, mortars hit the enemy on the head, and the Seventh, Eighth, and Second Companies charged up through the smoke screen.
    The west wall of the enemy's building collapsed, and a mere pile of it contained twenty-seven Chiang soldiers, dying there needlessly. At ten o'clock in the evening, a portion of the enemy broke through to the fields, but they did not escape either. The enemy's battalion commander, Liu Yan, also went to be a minor devil for King Yama. Mortars, heavy machine guns, light machine guns, the black and oily 60 mortars, air-bursting rifle grenades, and Canadian submachine guns all became our spoils of war. Two battalions of regular Chiang troops, two-thirds of Cao Fulin's mobile regiment of the 55th Division, were wiped out.

　　打开胜利的道路
    刘广斌
    淋着雨，踏着泥，远望着东南方向的火光——队伍向鹅鸭厂前进。
    随着一声枪响，我们的迫击炮开火了，三营进鹅鸭厂正西打进去。天亮以后，全村的西部已为我占领，敌人被困在村子的中段。
    雨越下越紧。
    七八连的阵地前，敌人冲过来，八连一班胡有才同志的机枪打的哈哈叫，敌人就在泥水里滚回去。
    正午，天晴开了，敌人的气焰已经开始下降，鹿砦、门板、木棒插满他们的周围，但是那有什么用呢？
    大队首长向大家讲：“打响头一炮，打开胜利道路，迎接我们的主力！”
    黄昏，山炮开火，平射炮摧毁敌人的墙壁，曲射炮，打到敌人头上，七、八、二连，在烟幕中冲上去。
    敌人楼屋的西墙坍下去了，仅一堆就是二十七个蒋家兵，无谓的死在那里。晚上十点钟，一部分敌人突到漫地里，但也没有逃掉，敌人的一营长刘晏也给阎王当小鬼去了。迫击炮重机枪轻机枪，黑油油的六○炮，空中炸的枪榴弹，加拿大冲锋机，都成了我们的胜利品。两个营的正规蒋军，五五师曹福林的机动团至此完蛋了三分之二。
