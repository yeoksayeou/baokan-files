    Qixian Villages Bury Landmines Everywhere
    [Reported by this newspaper from Qixian] To celebrate the 26th anniversary of the Party, from July 1st to July 7th, Qixian County launched landmine warfare, guerrilla warfare, and political propaganda warfare throughout the county, telling the masses in the guerrilla areas about the victories of the great counter-offensive and the history of the Party. On the 4th of this month, each district first launched a campaign to capture prisoners. The members of the "Homecoming Corps" who fled from Anyang were captured in the Third and Fifth Districts, twenty-two people in one day (three children excluded), including Zhao Zhongyi, a secretary of the Anyang Police Bureau, Chuan Peng, an employee of the Telecommunications Bureau, two carts, one bicycle, and many clothes. Because the enemy suffered losses, before dawn on the 5th, they surrounded Sanlitun, the village where Yang, the head of our Fifth District, lived, with more than 200 people. Our cadres and militiamen, a total of fifteen people, under the leadership of District Chief Yang, put forward the slogan of resolutely breaking through the encirclement rather than being captured, and not letting the enemy capture even one alive, even if it meant death. Under this slogan, a bloody battle was launched, lasting for an hour. The enemy stepped on the landmines we had buried, disrupting their firepower, and all our cadres and militiamen broke through the village. In our resolute and courageous struggle, more than ten enemies were wounded, and one was killed. Yang Gui, the head of our Fifth District, and three other comrades were also gloriously wounded. The liberated masses and village cadres from various villages, upon hearing the news, came to express their condolences in groups of three and five. Some were busy pouring water for the wounded comrades, and others were feeding them. Everyone said, "District Chief Yang was wounded for the sake of our poor people's liberation, we must come and see him." Landmines played a very important role in this breakout battle, detonating four mines in total, killing one enemy and wounding three. Currently, landmine warfare and guerrilla warfare are being vigorously carried out in various districts. (Ren Jie)
    [Reported by this newspaper] On the 27th of last month, the Fifth District of Qixian held a meeting of village cadres from the entire district to discuss the need to greatly expand the landmine explosion movement, universally launch guerrilla warfare, protect homes and property, and strike at the stubborn army for seizing grain and conscripting soldiers. Everyone at the meeting was in high spirits. After returning to their villages and mobilizing, the masses in each village fiercely plunged into this movement. On the 28th alone, the entire district dug ××× mine pits on large and small roads, inside and outside the villages. Each village also dug hidden mine pits to dig countless mine pits in the places where the enemy was bound to pass. Whether in peacetime or wartime, whether the mines were buried or were empty pits, the enemy was not allowed to detect them. The tools for burying mines, whether stepping, pulling, bow, visible, or hidden, were prepared very adequately. The masses happily said, "If Chiang's bandit troops come again, we must make them eat a bellyful of iron eggs, so that the dog ×'s come walking and are carried back.” (Qixian Public Small Newspaper)
