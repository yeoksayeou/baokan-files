    German Land Reform

    The land reform carried out in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany at the end of 1945 was a major event economically, socially, and politically. If fascism is to be thoroughly eradicated, its economic foundation must be eliminated. Everyone remembers that the Junker land ownership system was one of the most important economic foundations of German fascism and militarism. In this country, the Junker families controlled economic and political power. They were the bastion of reaction and the breeding ground for aggressive imperialist ambitions.

    A look at the following figures will show how great the economic power of the Junker landlords really was: According to the agricultural survey of 1933, 34,000 landlords owned a total of 15,692,000 hectares of land, that is, 37.9 percent of the total area of central Germany. On the other hand, poor farmers operating 0.05 to 0.5 hectares accounted for almost half of German farmers, a total of 2,800,000 households, but occupied only 1.2 percent of the total land; 800,000 small farmers operating arable land of 2 to 5 hectares accounted for 25.8 percent of all German farms, but occupied only 6.2 percent of the total. Under Hitler's rule, the position of the Junkers was further strengthened.

    As a result of the rule of the Junker landlords, feudal relations were deeply rooted in German agriculture. Modern Germany, especially the eastern region, still had semi-feudal land ownership, forced labor, and other vestiges of serfdom.

    With this economic power as a backdrop, the Junker landlords seized the leadership of Prussia and later the leadership of a unified Germany. They often served as state officials, all of whom were greedy and heartless bureaucrats. Although the dominant figures in German politics and economy were the dignitaries of financial capital, many important positions in state organs were still in the hands of Junker landlords. Moreover, the landlord class was the main source of German officers. Officers from Junker landlords often carried a special Prussian arrogance, xenophobic patriotism, and a love of aggression. Junker landlords often combined closely with the dignitaries of monopoly capital through marriage, joint management of banks and cartels, and other methods.

    German landlords were particularly interested in imperialist aggressive policies: Junkers were eager to acquire new land. At the same time, propaganda for aggressive policies could divert the minds of land-poor farmers, preventing them from paying attention to the large land ownership of the Junkers. This was the political basis for the imperialist alliance between financial oligarchs and large landlords. Fascism was the product and tool of the German ruling class's policy of imperialism for the purpose of plunder.

    It is certainly no accident that the ruling forces of the Nazis, the armed Nazi organizations, and the leaders of the Hitler army all came from Junker families. The policies of the fascist state stipulated the preservation of the Junker class and its economic base – stipulating the continuation of feudal relations in agriculture. The hereditary rights and the law promulgated in September 1933 were intended to establish a strong pillar of fascist groups in the countryside, creating a privileged class of wealthy farmers. The imperial laws concerning the farmer class also pursued the same purpose, which was to force the peasant economy to adapt to the needs of the wartime economy.

    We all know that the Hitler gang once issued a lot of empty promises to the farmers. Their only way to solve the land problem was still through the bloody military aggression policy against foreign territories. This policy of plunder cost peace-loving nations a high price, and the German people shouldered a heavy burden.

    In the process of the Hitler bandits preparing for aggression, they conducted endless requisitions from small landowners. Laws abolishing small-scale farming, decrees prohibiting the use of public land, and other similar measures took millions of hectares of land from the hands of small landowners. In this way, the fascists further exacerbated the land poverty of the peasants.

            ×              ×              ×

    After Hitlerism was defeated, the idea of ​​widespread land reform naturally became an urgent issue, as anti-fascist groups and parties emerged for the first time in the German occupied zone. It was necessary not only to accelerate the elimination of the Junkers and their material foundations, which land reform would naturally do, but also to develop the country's agriculture after the war. The most urgent measure was to solve the food supply problem. The food problem was exacerbated by the fact that thousands of German families returned to Germany from Eastern Europe, and families in the German occupied zone needed to be supplied.

    The only way to solve this problem was to carry out extensive land reform, no longer allowing large landlords to continue to retain land, and not to repeat the mistakes after World War I. After World War I, a nominal land reform was carried out, and as a result, the absolute rule of the large landlords was not touched at all. In that land reform, the large landlords lost nothing; on the contrary, they made a fortune by selling land to immigrants at high prices. Many immigrants, although they obtained land, were unable to purchase the necessary farming tools and establish stable farms because they did not have state loans, so they became indebted, went bankrupt day by day, and finally lost their land to become hired farmhands for the large landlords.

    In view of the experience of the previous failed reform, the two major parties in the anti-fascist alliance—the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party—jointly drafted a plan: to carry out rapid and thorough land reform on the basis of free distribution of land from large landlords. Although land reform was obviously not to the liking of people like Koeth (leader of the Free Democratic Party) or Heim and Scherpen (leaders of the Christian Democratic Union), the basic masses of these two parties and the sentiments of the peasants forced them to support land reform. They first procrastinated, then restricted. These leaders distrusted the "economic effectiveness" of confiscating the land of large landlords, insisting on delaying land reform until the country's food situation improved. And they also proposed that only the land of war criminals should be confiscated; demanding that the large landlords whose land was confiscated be given "fair compensation"... However, the draft prepared by the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party was widely supported by democrats in urban and rural areas, and was also formally adopted by the remaining two parties in the anti-fascist alliance.

    As early as September 1945, three months after Germany's surrender, land reform had actually begun. On September 3, at the proposal of the Joint Committee of Anti-Fascist Parties, the Saxon Provincial Government passed a resolution (law) on land reform. In its first article, this law succinctly explained the social, political, and economic significance of land reform, considering it "the most important component of the democratic transformation of Germany and a necessary condition for economic recovery."

    According to this law, all land belonging to war criminals and instigators of war, or leaders and active members of the Hitler party and other fascist organizations, was confiscated regardless of its amount; the same method was adopted for all feudal Junker landlords and landlords owning more than 100 hectares, including the confiscation of houses, livestock, and farming tools. State land was also distributed, with the exception of land used for scientific research or experimental farms, land of municipal autonomous organs and village communes or cooperatives, and land of churches.

    The distribution of land, in addition to the part stipulated to be used for the establishment of model farms and other important purposes, is generally proposed by the Land Reform Committee and then discussed and approved by meetings of landless and land-deficient farmers. Land is distributed in plots to farmers with less than five hectares, agricultural workers, and immigrants from other places. At the same time, poorer farmers can receive simple farming tools and livestock. Confiscated tractors, threshers, combines, and other agricultural machinery are kept by the Farmers Mutual Aid Committee and can be rented out. The land obtained by farmers is repaid in installments over ten to twenty years, the total amount of which is equal to the value of one year's harvest per hectare of land, about 1,000 to 1,500 kilograms of naked wheat. The farms established by land reform cannot be distributed, sold, or leased.

    These are the main principles of the Saxon Provincial Government's resolution on land reform, and the resolutions passed by other Soviet occupied zones—Brandenburg, Mecklenburg, Western Pomerania, and Thuringia—also stipulated the same principles.

    The land reform in the Soviet occupied zone was basically completed by the beginning of December 1945. According to the preliminary statistics published by the Central Agricultural and Forestry Bureau on November 20 of that year: the land of 7,000 large landlords had been distributed, a total of 1,648,898 hectares of land, including 350,000 hectares of woodland. The beneficiaries were 59,200 small farmers, 197,833 landless farmers and agricultural workers, and 64,130 immigrants from other regions. A portion of the land was reserved for the purpose of organizing model farms and resettling German overseas Chinese who were returning home.

    Naturally, the landlords vehemently opposed the implementation of land reform. They tried to organize strikes in autumn sowing and harvesting, and carried out terrorism and sabotage with all their strength. They sold livestock, machinery, and farming tools, depleted their movable property, engaged in various speculative activities, and so on. They tried to evade the law through agents in government agencies in order to retain at least part of their land. They also wanted to declare their territories as model farms and breeding farms. Some landlords tried to appear as anti-fascists in order to escape the confiscation of their property. They tried every means to instigate their former employees and agricultural workers to oppose the reform. Remnants of Hitler manufactured rumors to scare the farmers, saying that land reform would soon collapse under the pressure of Britain and the United States. Among administrative and judicial officials, as well as among the leaders of bourgeois parties, the landlords found partners who sponsored their conspiracies.

    The shameless propaganda of the enemies of land reform, their procrastination, and attempts at terrorism were all in vain. Land reform was warmly supported by the peasants, who actively participated in the liquidation and confiscation of landlord land. The newspapers in Berlin published many resolutions passed at peasant meetings, demanding the immediate implementation of land reform. Urban workers also supported the reform, especially working hard to restore the production of agricultural machinery and repair farming tools.

    The leaders of the Free Democratic Party and the Christian Democratic Union verbally approved of land reform, but in reality supported the enemies of land reform, suffering a miserable defeat on this issue. When land distribution was really put into action regardless of all opposition conspiracies, Koeth, Heim, and their accomplices decided to come out in open opposition. At the beginning of December 1945, the leader of the Christian Democratic Union actually refused to sign the four-party communiqué, which was issued to aid the farmers who had acquired land in the reform. This aroused fierce criticism from democrats, culminating in the passage of a resolution at the plenary meeting of the Christian Democratic Union headquarters and provincial representatives, expelling the party chairman Heim and Scherpen from the party, saying that they were implementing reactionary policies. Koeth was also forced to resign as chairman of the Free Democratic Party for the same reason.

    The land reform implemented in the Soviet occupied zone is a very important move from the perspective of Germany's democratic reconstruction and development prospects as a peaceful country. It can be said that this reform will affect other regions, where the land of large landlords remains untouched, and is still a serious obstacle to the eradication of Hitlerism to this day.

    All those who have been to the Soviet occupied zone, such as representatives of the World Federation of Trade Unions, British members of parliament, trade union representatives, and foreign newspaper journalists, have pointed out the positive significance of land reform.

    "This reform," said the "New Statesman and Nation" magazine on February 5, "together with the purge of Nazi officials and entrepreneurs... has truly eliminated the social class on which Nazism took root."

    The magazine further acknowledged that the policies implemented in the Soviet occupied zone were more reasonable than British policies, as the magazine said, British policies tended to preserve the Nazis in power.

    A "Manchester Guardian" reporter wrote on February 1 regarding the publication of the preliminary statistics of land reform:

    "As a result of land reform, the Russians have established prestige among the majority of Germans, who are grateful to Russia and firmly believe that the old system is gone forever."

    In addition to these rational comments, there are also other opinions. Some people have tried to denigrate this reform and obliterate its economic and political significance. After the first decrees of land reform were published, Reuters' Berlin reporter Lawwood hurried to report to the world that land reform could at best partially solve the farmer problem.

    Another reporter from the same news agency, Barkley, openly expressed his sorrow over the decline of German landlords:

    "The class destroyed, consisting of thousands of families, with the exception of a few (?) parasites, the rest are highly skilled agricultural experts who have accumulated generations of experience."

    A certain daily newspaper published in Berlin, under the inspection of the US authorities, dared not openly oppose land reform, so it played a trick, and at the end of October 1945, it published a "reader's" letter, defending the large landlords. The author of the letter, signed Robert Falsche, attempted to prove that the distribution of land from large landlords would harm the interests of the citizens.

    Some British and American newspapers deliberately compared land reform with some policies adopted in other occupied zones, such as the abolition of Hitler's "farmland inheritance law," and the distribution of land from certain military organs to farmers, etc., in order to dilute the true significance of land reform. Obviously, these measures were forced to be carried out due to the urgent needs of the countryside, and cannot solve the land problem, let alone be compared with the land reform implemented in the Soviet occupied zone.

    Not only did newspapers oppose it, but in mid-October of that year, when land reform was fully underway, "New York Post" Washington reporter Prell reported that Milphy, the political advisor to the US representative on the Allied Control Council, sent a secret telegram to Congress, expressing great concern about the confiscation of Junker land in eastern Germany. What he feared was that public transportation, industry, banks, and other private property would soon be socialized. Prell said: "It clearly indicates a desire to protest in the name of the United States."

    Obviously, there are some people in the Western occupation authorities in Germany who are trying to slander land reform as the first step towards Germany's "reddening" to scare their compatriots. For example, the British military government's communication agency "United News" recently reported that collective farms are being organized in the Soviet occupied zone. "United News" is written for those die-hard reactionaries, who will turn red in the face when they hear the words "collective farm," and they don't care whether it's a rumor or not. It is not difficult to believe that any calm and objective observer can understand that land reform in Germany today is a basic democratic measure, which is proposed in accordance with the program of political and economic democratic transformation of Germany stipulated in the Allied Berlin Conference resolution. And those who oppose land reform are precisely those who spare no effort to preserve the economic and social foundations of German fascism and militarism.

    德国的土地改革
    一九四五年底在德国苏军占领区所进行的土地改革，无论在经济上、社会上、政治上都是一件大事。倘要彻底肃清法西斯主义，那就非消灭它的经济基础不可。大家都还记得，容克地主制乃是德国法西斯主义和军阀主义的最重要的经济基础之一。在这个国度里，容克家族操纵着经济的和政治的大权。他们是反动的堡垒，是侵略的帝国主义野心的温床。
    只要看以下的数目字，就可知道容克地主的经济力量究竟有多大：根据一九三三年的农业调查，三万四千个地主占有总数一五、六九二、○○○公顷土地，就是说占德国中部总面积的百分之三七·九，另一方面，经营○·○五到○·五公顷的贫农，这一类农民占德国农民几乎一半，他们一共有二、八○○、○○○户，而占地数总共不过全部土地的百分之一·二；八○○、○○○户小农，其所经营的耕地面积是二到五公顷，这一类农场占德国全部农场的百分之二五·八，而所占有的土地只是总数的百分之六·二。在希特勒统治时，容克的地位又更加强了。
    由于容克地主统治的结果，封建关系在德国农业中是相当根深蒂固的。现代的德国，特别是东部地区，仍然存在着半封建的土地所有制，劳役制，以及其他的农奴制残余。
    由于有此经济力量做背景，容克地主就掌握了普鲁士的领导权，以后又掌握了统一的德国的领导权。他们经常担任国家官吏，都是一些贪得无厌的脚色和没有心肝的官僚。虽然德国政治经济中起决定作用的是财政资本的显贵人物，可是国家机关中仍有许多重要职位是在容克地主之手。不仅如此，地主阶级是德国军官的主要来源，从容克地主出身的军官往往带着一种特别的普鲁士傲慢神气，排外的爱国主义和好侵略。容克地主往往借缔姻、共同管理银行和康采仑种种方法而与独占资本的权贵密切结合。
    德国地主对于帝国主义的侵略政策特别有兴趣：容克渴望取得新的土地。同时，宣传侵略政策又可转移缺乏土地的农民思想，使他们不再注意到容克大土地所有的状况。这是财政寡头和大地主结成帝国主义联盟的政治基础。法西斯主义正是德国统治阶级以掠夺为目的的帝国主义政策的产物和工具。
    纳粹的统治势力，武装的纳粹组织和希特勒军队的领导人物都出自容克世家，这当然不是偶然的了。法西斯国家的政策规定保留容克阶级及其经济基础——规定农业中封建关系的延续。世袭权和一九三三年九月所公布的法律就是要在乡村中建立起法西斯集团的强固的支柱，造成一批富裕农民的特权阶级。关于农民阶级的帝国法律也是追求同一目的，就是强制农民经济适合于战时经济的需要。    我们都知道，希特勒匪帮曾经向农民开了一大堆空头支票。他们解决土地问题的唯一方法乃仍靠对外国领土的血腥的军事侵略政策。这一掠夺政策使爱好和平的民族付了很高的代价，而德国人民也就挑起了重担。
    在希特勒匪徒准备侵略的过程中，他们曾向小的土地所有者进行层出不穷的征发。废止小农经营的法律，禁止使用公地的法令以及其他类似的措施从小的土地所有者的手里夺去了几百万公顷的土地。这样一来，法西斯就更进一步恶化了农民的土地贫乏。
            ×              ×              ×
    在希特勒主义被打败之后，由于德国占领区首次出现了反法西斯的团体和政党，广泛的土地改革的思想自然就成了迫切的问题了。不仅要求加速消灭容克及其物质基础，土地改革自然要这样做，而且为了在战后发展这个国家的农业也需要这样做。最迫切的措施是解决食粮供给的问题。由于成千的德国家庭从东欧迁回德国，由于德国被占区的家庭需要供给，致使食粮问题更加严重。
    要解决这个问题的唯一办法只有进行广泛的土地改革，不再让大地主继续保留土地，不要再重踏第一次世界大战后的覆辙。第一次世界大战后曾进行过一次有名无实的土地改革，结果大地主的绝对统治丝毫没有触犯。在那次土地改革中大地主什么也没有失掉；相反的，他们靠着高价卖地给移民而大发其财。许多移民虽然得到土地，但是因为没有国家贷款而无力置办必要的耕具和建立稳固了的农场，于是负了债，一天天走向破产，最后丢了土地去给大地主当雇农。
    鉴于上次改革失败经验，结成反法西斯联盟政党中的两大政党——共产党和社会民主党，共同拟出一个计划：在无代价分配大地主土地的基础上进行迅速的彻底的土地改革。虽然土地改革显然不合柯契（自由民主党的领袖）或者海姆和雪里本（基督教民主联盟领袖）这一类人的胃口，但是由于此两政党的基本群众和农民的情绪迫使他们不能不支持土地改革。他们始则怠工，继则限制。这些领袖对于没收大地主土地的“经济效能”是不信任的，坚持拖延到国家的粮食状况有了改善之后才进行土地改革。并且他们还提出只限于没收战犯的土地；要求对于被没收土地的大地主给以“公正的代价”……。可是，由于共产党和社会民主党拟定的草案却得到城乡人民中民主分子的广泛支持，也为反法西斯联盟中其余两政党所正式通过。
    远在一九四五年九月间，即德国投降后三个月，土地改革实际上已经开始。九月三日，由于反法西斯政党联合委员会的提议，撒克逊尼亚省政府关于土地改革通过了一份决议（法律）。在它的第一条里，这一法律提纲契领地说明了土地改革的社会、政治、经济的意义，认为是“德国民主改造的最重要的组成部分和经济复兴的必要条件。”
    按照这个法律，凡是属于战犯和战争挑拨者，或希特勒政党及其他法西斯团体的领袖和积极分子的土地一概没收，不管其数量多少；对于一切封建的容克地主和拥有一百公顷以上的地主也采取同样办法，没收包括房屋、牲畜、耕具。国家土地也进行分配，唯科学所研究或实验农场所用的土地、市自治机关和村公社或合作社的土地、教堂的土地例外。
    土地的分配，除了规定用于建立模范农场和其他重要目的部分以外，一般都是由土地改革委员会先作提议，再由无地农民和缺地农民开会讨论通过。土地按块分配给五公顷以下的农民、农业工人和从他处迁来的移民。同时，比较贫苦的农民可以分得简单的农具和耕畜。没收来的拖拉机、打谷机、康拜因机以及其他农业机器由农民互助委员会保管，可以出租。农民所得土地在十年至二十年内分期偿付，其总额等于每公顷地一年收获的价值，约有裸麦一千至一千五百公斤。土地改革所设立的农场不能分配、出卖或出租。
    这些就是撒克逊尼亚省政府关于土地改革决议的主要原则，其余苏军占领区——布兰登堡、梅克伦堡、西波米拉尼亚和杜林基亚各省所通过的决议也规定了相同的原则。
    苏军占领区的土地改革到一九四五年十二月初基本上已告完成。根据中央农林局该年十一月二十日公布的初步统计：七千个大地主的土地已被分配，一共分配了一、六四八、八九八公顷土地，其中有林地三五○、○○○公顷。得到果实者有五九、二○○个小农，一九七、八三三个无地农民和农业工人，还有六四、一三○个从其他地区来的移民。有一部分土地保留着准备用以组织模范农场和安置正在回国的德侨。
    自然，地主剧烈反对土地改革的执行。他们试图对秋季播种和收割组织怠工，全力进行恐怖主义和破坏活动。他们出卖牲畜、机器和耕具，弄光了动产，从事各种投机活动，以及其他等等。他们试图通过政府机关中的代理人规避法律，以便达到最少也要保留一部分土地。他们还想宣布他们的领地是模范农场、育种场。有些地主试图装做反法西斯者的面孔出现，以逃避财产被没收。他们曾想方设法煽动从前的雇员和农业工人起来反对改革。希特勒残余分子制造谣言吓唬农民说：在英美压力下，土地改革很快就要垮台。在行政和司法官吏中间，也在资产阶级政党领袖中间，地主找到了赞助他们的阴谋的伙伴。
    土地改革的敌人的无耻宣传，他们的怠工和恐怖主义的企图，结果都是徒劳无功的。土地改革受到农民热烈的支持，他们积极参加了地主土地清算和没收。柏林的报纸上刊载了许多农民会议上通过的决议，要求立即进行土地改革。城市工人也支持这个改革，在恢复农业机器的生产和修理农具上特别卖力气。
    自由民主党和基督教民主联盟的领导人物口头上赞成土地改革，实际上却支持土地改革的敌人，在这问题上遭受惨败。当土地分配不顾一切反对阴谋，真正动手进行时，柯契、海姆及其同伙曾决定公开出来反对。一九四五年十二月初，基督教民主联盟的领袖竟拒绝在四党文告上签字，这文告是为援助那些在改革中获得土地的农民而发的。这个引起了民主人士的激烈抨击，终至在基督教民主联盟本部和省代表所召开的全体大会上通过了一个决议，开除该党主席——海姆和雪里本出党，决议上说，因为他们执行反动政策。柯契也因同样的理由被迫辞去自由民主党主席的职位。
    苏军占领区内所施行的土地改革，从德国民主重建和作为一个和平国家的发展前途来说都是十分重要之举。可以这样说，这一改革将影响其他地区，在那些地区大地主的土地依然原封未动，一直到今天都是肃清希特勒主义的严重障碍。
    凡是到过苏军占领区的人们，象世界职工联盟的代表，英国国会议员，职工会代表以及外国报纸的新闻记者，都指出了土地改革的积极意义。
    “这一改革”，二月五日的“新政治家与国家”杂志说，“加上对纳粹官吏和企业家的肃清……这就真正消灭了纳粹主义所赖以生根的社会阶级。”
    该杂志更进一步承认苏军占领区内所施行的政策要比英国的政策更合理些，正如该杂志所说，英国的政策倾向于保留纳粹当权。
    “曼彻斯特导报”记者在二月一日关于公布土地改革的初步统计写道：
    “由于土地改革的结果，俄国人在大部分德国人中树起了威信，他们都感激俄国，而且坚决相信，旧制度是一去不复返了。”
    除了这些理智的评论以外，也还有另外的意见。某些人企图诋毁这个改革，抹杀他的经济、政治意义。土地改革的第一批法令公布后，路透社驻柏林记者劳伍德赶紧向世界报导说，土地改革充其量只能部分解决农民问题。
    同一通讯社的另一记者柏克莱居然公开的对德国地主的没落表示痛心：
    “被毁灭的这个由成千家庭组成的阶级，除了少数（？）是寄生者外，其余的都是积蓄了几代经验的高明的农业专家”。
    在柏林出版的某日报，受了美当局的检查，不敢公开反对土地改革，于是耍了一个枪花，在一九四五年十月底它发表了一封“读者”来信，为大地主作辩护。该信作者署名罗贝特·发尔雪，企图证明分配大地主土地将损及市民的利益。
    有些英美的新闻纸故意把土地改革和其他占领区所采行一些政策作比较，比如废止希特勒的“田产承袭法律”，某些军事机关的土地分配给农民等等，目的是想冲淡土地改革的真正意义。显然，这些措施是由于乡村的迫切需要而被迫进行的，并不能解决土地问题，更不能和苏军占领区内所施行的土地改革相比较。
    不仅是报纸反对，该年十月中，当土地改革全面展开时，“纽约邮报”的华盛顿记者泼莱尔报道称：同盟国管制委员会美国代表的政治顾问梅尔菲以密电致送国会，对于德国东部容克土地的被没收甚表关怀。他所惧怕的是公用交通、工业、银行以及其他私有财产不久也将社会化。泼莱尔说：“显然表示着希望用美国名义提出抗议。”
    显然在德国西部占领当局中有一些人，企图诬称土地改革是德国“赤化”的第一步来吓唬他们的同胞。例如，英国军政府的通讯机关“联合新闻”最近报导称，苏军占领区正在组织集体农场了。“联合新闻”正是写给那些死硬的反动派看的，他们一听到“集体农场”几个字就会脸红脖子粗的，那里还管它谣言不谣言。不难相信，任何冷静的、客观的观察家都能理解，今天德国的土地改革是基本的民主的措施，这是根据盟国柏林会议决议上所规定的从政治经济上民主改造德国的纲领所提出来的。而反对土地改革的正是那些不惜一切代价以保留德国法西斯主义和军阀主义的经济社会基础的人们。（王子野译自苏联“新时代”第六期）
