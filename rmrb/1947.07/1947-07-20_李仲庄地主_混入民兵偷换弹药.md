    Li Zhongzhuang Landlord
    Infiltrates Militia to Swap Ammunition
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 17th] In Huo County, a landlord was discovered infiltrating the militia to carry out sabotage. After Xun Shuwan, a landlord from Li Zhongzhuang in the newly recovered area of ​​the county, was liquidated, his son Xun Sheng pretended to be active and joined the militia. The village work team did not give it careful consideration, only thinking that he could not walk fast and would not cause any trouble, so they gave him a gun. When the government called for the protection of the summer harvest, the village replenished the militia's bullets, and Xun Sheng took the opportunity to get twenty rounds. Later, due to need, Xun Sheng's gun was called back, Xun Sheng excused that these twenty rounds of bullets were good and did not want to give them to others, so he exchanged them for another twenty rounds. Militiaman Li Guan felt very strange, and immediately carefully checked the bullets given by Xun Sheng, and found that the shells were completely modified with landmine explosives. This aroused everyone's attention, and Xun Sheng was detained and sent to the government for processing.

    李仲庄地主
    混入民兵偷换弹药
    【本报太岳十七日电】霍县发现地主混入民兵进行破坏。该县新收复区李仲庄地主荀述万被清算后，其子荀生假装积极，打入民兵。该村工作队未加慎重考虑，只觉得他跑不动路，不会出什么事，便发给他一条枪。政府号召保卫夏收时，该村充实民兵子弹，荀生乘机拿到二十发。后因需要，将荀生枪调回，荀生借口这二十发子弹好，不愿给别人，另换了二十发。民兵李管很觉奇怪，随即仔细检查了荀生给的子弹，发现弹壳内完全改装了地雷炸药，这才引起大家注意，将荀生扣押，送往政府处理。
