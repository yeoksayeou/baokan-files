Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. A United Press correspondent reported from Shanghai on the 16th that Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda offensive of a "general mobilization order," attempting to stimulate enthusiasm for the civil war over the past week, has largely failed. Despite Chiang Kai-shek's broadcast appeals for "common efforts to defeat the Communist Party," the indifferent masses not only do not participate in the general mobilization but simply ignore it. Students openly oppose the Kuomintang government, and hundreds of them are still being isolated for "re-education." Newspapers under Kuomintang control frequently publish the "victories" (fabricated victories) of the Kuomintang army in prominent positions, but most people only turn to the finance and economics sections to see the rise and fall of stocks; most Chinese people only hope that once the war ends, prices will fall so they can feed their families. The Kuomintang's calls for "wartime public bonds" and "comforting the troops" are ignored, and only a little money is raised through Kuomintang-controlled organizations. The Kuomintang is preparing to hold mass rallies in major cities on the 20th in order to urgently create some sentiment similar to a popular "movement to defeat the Communist Party," but it is expected that only some "representatives of public organizations" controlled by the Kuomintang will participate. The correspondent said that the Kuomintang government's current approach to dealing with the people is to post slogans in restaurants and public places, warning people not to talk about "state secrets." Newspapers suspected of being left-leaning are closed down, and radio stations are simply prohibited from saying any "bad things" about the Kuomintang, with violations punishable by cancellation of registration.

    蒋党喧嚷“总动员”群众根本不理会
    【新华社陕北十八日电】合众社记者十六日自上海报导称：蒋介石一周来企图激发内战热情的“总动员令”宣传攻势，已大为失败。虽有蒋介石的广播呼号“共同努力击败共产党”，冷淡的群众不仅不参加总动员，而且根本不理会。学生们则公开反对国民党政府，他们当中仍有数百人被隔离开来实行“重新教育”。国民党控制下的报纸经常以显著地位刊载国民党军的“胜利”（捏造的胜利），但大多数人都只翻开财政、经济栏看股票的涨落；一般中国人中通常只希望一旦战事终结，物价下落能养活一家。国民党“战时公债”与“劳军”的呼吁被置若罔闻，只是通过国民党御用的团体才搞到一点钱。国民党准备于二十日在各大城市举行群众大会，以急切地造成一些类似民众“击溃共产党运动”的情绪，但是预料届时只会有一些国民党控制的“公共团体代表”参加。该记者说，国民党政府现在对付人民的办法是在餐馆及各公共场所贴上标语，警告人民不要谈论“国家秘密”，有左倾嫌疑的报纸被封闭，无线电台干脆禁止说国民党任何“坏话”，违者以取消登记处罚。
