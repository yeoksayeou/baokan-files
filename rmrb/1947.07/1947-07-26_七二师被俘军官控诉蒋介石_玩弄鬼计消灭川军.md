Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 24th. Senior officers of the Chiang Kai-shek's Sichuan 72nd Division (formerly an army), which was annihilated in Tai'an in April, have been pouring out their grievances to a responsible person of the People's Liberation Army, accusing Chiang Kai-shek of conspiring to eliminate the Sichuan "miscellaneous troops." Song Zhuqing, the Major General Director of the Political Department of the New 13th Brigade (formerly a division), said: "Last year, when the 72nd Army was stationed in Macheng, Chiang secretly transferred his direct line of the 11th Division to be stationed near Macheng to carry out armed surveillance. Then, he suddenly ordered Army Commander Fu Yi to be transferred to Wuhan Headquarters as a senior staff officer, and replaced him with Yang Wen, a Chiang-affiliated Sichuanese officer, as the reorganized 72nd Division (formerly army) commander. At that time, Army Commander Fu sent an urgent telegram to Wang Lingji, the commander-in-chief nominally holding the position of Jiangxi Chairman, asking whether to hand over military power. After receiving the telegram, Wang was so angry that he could not speak for a long time. He had to telegraph Chiang to resign from the Jiangxi chairmanship and telegraph Army Commander Fu, 'Just hand it over!' After receiving the reply telegram, the generals of the 72nd Army held another secret meeting, wanting to refuse Yang, but fearing coercion, they had to painfully hand it over." Liu Xinfu, the Lieutenant Colonel Chief of Staff of the 34th Brigade (Division), said angrily: "Our Brigade Commander Zhu Shunkun was promoted nominally but demoted in reality to the position of Deputy Division Commander, and the new Brigade Commander was replaced by Li Zeyao, a confidant of Hu Zongnan, Chiang's direct line." Han Ming, the Lieutenant Colonel Chief of Staff of the 13th Brigade (Division), analyzed that Chiang Kai-shek had four methods for eliminating the Sichuan Army: (1) "Using offsetting effects." This has two manifestations: one is to send the Sichuan Army to the front line to fight, without replenishing troops, without giving time for reorganization, and without issuing guns and artillery. The other is to adopt a sugar-coated policy of sowing discord, that is, giving some status to the Sichuan Army generals who went out of Sichuan, but not allowing them to gather together. Today, he coaxed A, saying: "You are an outstanding figure in the Sichuan Army, and the Central Government trusts you very much." Tomorrow, he would say the same deceptive words to B. This is to provoke Sichuan generals to compete with each other and offset their strength. (2) "Give you high office, seize your military power." For example, Wang Lingji was transferred to be the Chairman of Jiangxi Province, and Yang Sen was transferred to be the Chairman of Guizhou Province, but both of their military powers were removed. (3) "Do not let the Sichuan Army return to Sichuan." Many officers who were discharged and squeezed out in Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei cannot return home. (4) "Cut off the fuel under the cauldron." Shrink the Sichuan Army, shrink it again, and shrink it further, replace, replace, and replace again, replace all the grass-roots cadres, leaving only a Sichuan Army shell.

　　七二师被俘军官控诉蒋介石
  　玩弄鬼计消灭川军
    【新华社山东二十四日电】四月于泰安被歼蒋川军系七十二师（原军）高级军官纷纷对解放军某负责人倾诉蒋介石消灭四川“杂牌军”之阴谋。新十三旅（原师）少将政治部主任宋竹清谈称：“去年七十二军驻防麻城，蒋暗暗的把嫡系整十一师调驻麻城附近，实行武装监视，然后突然命令，傅翼军长调任武汉行营高参，以蒋系川籍军人杨文接任整编七十二师（原军）师长。当时傅军长打急电给挂江西主席衔的王陵基总司令，问是否交出兵权？王得电后，气得半天不说话，只好一面电蒋辞江西主席职，一面电傅军长“只好交吧！”七十二军的将校得复电后，又开了一次秘密会议，想拒绝杨，但慑于威逼，只得忍痛交代。”三十四旅（师）上校参谋长刘新甫愤慨地说：“我们旅长祝顺鲲明升暗降的调副师长职，新旅长就换了个蒋的嫡系胡宗南的心腹李则尧。”十三旅（师）上校参谋长韩明分析蒋介石消灭川军有四种手法说：（一）“起对消作用”。用这有两种表现形式：一是把川军调第一线作战，不补充兵，不给整训时间，不发枪炮。一是采糖衣政策，挑拨离间，即是对出川的川军将领都给些地位，但不让聚在一起。今天哄甲说：“你是川军中的杰出人物，中央很信任你。”明天又对乙说一套同样骗人的话。以此挑拨川籍将领彼此争风吃醋，力量对消。（二）“给你高官，夺你兵权。”如把王陵基调江西省主席，杨森调贵州省主席，但两人的兵权都解除了。（三）“不让川军回川。”在江西、湖南、湖北许多被编余和排挤掉的军官，有家归不得。（四）“釜底抽薪。”把川军缩小、缩小、再缩小，撤换、撤换、再撤换，把基层干部撤换尽了，剩下一个川军外壳。
