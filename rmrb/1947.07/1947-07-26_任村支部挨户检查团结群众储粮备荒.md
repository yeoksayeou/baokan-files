The Ren Village Branch actively leads the masses in fighting drought and preparing for famine, boldly proposing "If anyone starves on that street, the Communist Party members on that street are responsible!" With the efforts of all Party members and the masses, the village's drought resistance and famine preparedness work has achieved considerable success. When the prevention of drought and preparation for famine was initially proposed, it seemed that all streets were mobilized on the surface. However, after door-to-door inspections by the branch and district cadres, it was discovered that some people were not mixing bran and vegetables with their meals, some were throwing away leftover food, and many muddled ideas were also found. For example, the old man Yue Laohe said: "In the third year of Guangxu, there was a severe drought for sixty days after the wheat harvest. Autumn began and we relied on the summer heat, and the grain still yielded one stone and two dou per mu, so what is there to fear!" "Watering and planting is a waste of effort, how much can you plant!" A small number of middle-peasant households, such as Wang Qin, even developed some illusions, thinking that in the past, they could borrow grain from landlords, and this year they would definitely be able to borrow grain from him. Saving grain to help others is not as good as eating more themselves, and so on. In response to these ideas, meetings were held by street and mutual aid group at night to break Wang Qin's fear of borrowing grain. Yue Laohe insisted that there was no crop failure during the great drought of the third year of Guangxu. Recalling the result, it was a leap eighth month that year, but this year it is a leap second month, so his ideas were also straightened out. Everyone jointly proposed: "Better a thin stream that flows long, than a flood that suddenly stops." The branch then held an emergency meeting, proposing the slogan: "If anyone starves on that street, the Party members on that street are responsible." Village political director and model Party member Comrade Cheng Yufang first made a precise calculation in the second mutual aid group, calculating a total shortage of 55,300 catties of rice, which shocked everyone. Then they actively looked for ways to save and produce. Wu Weihui Director Wang Qingfa (Party member) used his own practical actions to lead all five mutual aid groups in the fourth street. The first time, he collected 11,990 feet of cloth woven by female group members and had male group members carry it to Shanxi to sell, exchanging it for 61,400 catties of rice. Production and famine preparedness activities were widely carried out throughout the village.
    [This newspaper, Shexian News] The Party members in the Eighth District take the lead, vigorously promoting thrift and famine preparedness based on the continuing development of the disaster. In response to the county committee's call for grain storage, Party members in Siziyan took the lead in saving rice according to groups, totaling more than 1,400 catties, and more than 1,900 catties of bran. So the masses followed suit, and the cooperative bought a lot of bran and measured grain for the masses. According to statistics, Siziyan and other six villages saved a total of more than 25,400 catties of rice in forty days. Most of the saved fried noodles during the Dragon Boat Festival were not used to cook fried cakes. In addition to actively leading the masses to save, Party members throughout the district also organized the masses to produce for self-salvation. Eight villages earned 600,000 yuan from transportation, four villages earned 400,000 yuan from digging up medicinal materials, five villages organized workers and organized timber factories, earning 243,000 yuan, and Qingta and other six villages organized groups to work temporarily in watery areas or places where it had rained. Currently, various villages are generally carrying out production activities such as collecting firewood, picking locust flowers, and extracting oil... The movement is still continuing to develop in depth, and under the slogan of "Guaranteeing that no one starves to death," Party members are actively leading the masses in production. (Yi Lin)

　　任村支部挨户检查团结群众储粮备荒
    【本报林县讯】任村支部积极领导群众抗旱备荒，响亮的提出“那道街饿死人，那道街的共产党员负责！”在全体党员、群众的努力下，该村抗旱备荒工作已获相当成绩：开始提出防旱备荒时，各街表面上似乎都动了，但经支部及区干部挨门挨户检查，发现有做饭不掺糠菜的，有丢剩饭的，还发现了不少糊涂思想：如老汉岳老河说：“光绪三年，麦后大旱六十天，立了秋靠暑伏，粮食还合石二收，怕啥！”“担水点种瞎误功夫，才能种多少！”少数中农户如王勤更产生了些错觉，认为过去借粮有地主，今年借粮一定会借到他头上，省下粮食救了别人，不如自己多吃点等等。根据这些，黑夜分街按互助组开会讨论，打破王勤的怕借粮思想，岳老河一口咬定光绪三年大旱不歉收，回想结果是那年闰八月，今年却是闰二月，思想也打通了，大家共同提出：“宁叫细水长流，不叫洪水断流。”支部接着开了个紧急会议，提出：“那道街饿死人，那道街党员负责”的口号，村政治主任模范党员程毓芳同志先在第二互助组做了个精确计算，共缺米五万五千三百斤，使大家大吃一惊，便积极从节约和生产上想办法。武委会主任王清发（党员）用自己的实际行动，把四街五个互助组全带起来，第一次收女组员们织的一一九九○尺布，由男组员挑到山西卖，换回六一四○○斤米，全村生产备荒普遍开展起来。
    【本报涉县讯】八区党员带头，依据继续发展着的灾情，大力推动节约备荒。寺子岩党员响应县委储粮号召，首起模范按小组保存米共一千四百余斤，糠一千九百斤，于是群众也照办了，合作社给群众们买糠量粮也很多。寺子岩等六村，四十天的节约统计共省米二万五千四百余斤。端午节节省油面大部分都没煮油糕。全区党员除积极带领群众节约外，并组织群众生产自救，八个村运输赚钱六十万余元，四个村刨药材赚洋四十万元，五个村组织工人，组织木材厂，赚洋二十四万三千元，青塔等六村并组织小组分别到水地区或已落雨地方打短工。现各村普遍进行打柴、采槐花、打油……等生产，运动仍在继续深入发展中，党员在“保证不饿死人”的口号下，积极带领群众生产。（一林）
