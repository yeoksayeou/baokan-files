Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 9th: TASS, Rome, July 7th: Italian Socialist Party leader Nenni published a special article in the "Avanti" newspaper, comparing the policies of the French Socialist Party with those of the Italian Christian Democratic Party. Nenni wrote: "What happened in France has also happened in our country. The only difference is that our government belongs to the Christian Democratic Party, not a government led by the Socialist Party. The Christian Democratic government is a bit further to the right, although it also harbors illusions of being a centrist party." Nenni pointed out: The practical experience during the interwar period has already shown the necessity of joint action between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party. This demand is now even more urgent. Nenni continued: "When we are loyal to the principle that the aims and interests of all working people and the proletariat are consistent, we are accused of 'making communism'; but when we deviate from this position, objectively we are promoting right-wing policies, digging the grave of the Socialist Party with our own hands." Nenni continued: "The only solution is the unity of people's groups, leftists, and a left-wing government. This situation can only occur through the outcome of elections. Then, from now until the elections, the only possible and desirable government is one belonging to a broad republican democratic front."

    意大利社会党领袖南尼称：社共两党应联合行动
    要求组织广泛的民主阵线政府
    【新华社陕北九日电】塔斯社罗马七日讯：意大利社会党领袖南尼在“亚万提”报上发表专论，拿法国社会党的政策来和意大利基督教民主党的政策相比较。南尼写道：“法国发生的事，在我国也发生了。其间惟一的不同处，就是我们的政府是属于基督教民主党的，不是由社会党带头的政府。基督教民主党的政府是更向右一点，虽然也抱有中间派的幻想。”南尼指出：在两次世界大战中间的时期的实际经验，已经显示出社会党和共产党有联合行动的必要。这个要求，现在更为迫切。南尼继称：“当我们忠实于所有劳动人民和无产阶级的目的和利益有一致性的原则时，我们被控诉为‘闹共产’了；但是当我们离开这个立场的时候，客观上我们便推行了右翼政策，用我们自己的手为社会党掘着坟墓。”南尼继称：“惟一的解决办法，便是人民集团、左派分子和左派的政府之联合、这种情况只有靠选举的结果才能发生。那么从现在到选举以前，唯一有可能性的合乎要求的政府，便是属于广泛的共和民主阵线的政府。”
