　　Licheng Five Hundred Cadres
  　Strive to Learn and Improve Themselves
    [This newspaper, Licheng News] Comrade Liu Jianfu, Secretary of the Licheng County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, called on every Communist Party member and mass representative at the public meeting commemorating July 1st to study Chairman Mao's thought and style, strive to improve themselves, and lead the masses to support the great counter-offensive. Especially after the Party is made public, every party member must be loyal to the masses, lead the masses to seek liberation independently, be humble and frank, dare to self-criticize, and strive to make new contributions. Under the personal leadership of the County Party Committee, more than 500 county, district, and village cadres, party members, and mass representatives carried out self-study and self-examination. Fan Shuwen from Huojia Kiln said: Mao Zedong's thought is to be loyal to the masses. When I speak at meetings, I say I'm for the masses, but in actual work I forget the masses, especially looking down on backward people and not mobilizing them. I am a bit selfish, and in the future, when studying Chairman Mao, I will never forget the masses. Li Songhui, a representative of the masses in Hou@, said: "My father herded cattle for seventeen years, and I lived as a farmhand for twenty-three years, herded cattle for a few years. Last winter, I turned over, got land and a house, and it became our world. We must not be polite to feudal landlords at all." District cadre Wang Huofu said: "During rent reduction in 1942, Wang Heshang rented six mu of land from Wang Gao's family. He did not mobilize from the ideological perspective, but instead handled the rent reduction for them. At night, he secretly returned the land to the landlord. During the re-examination of rent reduction in 1944, Heshang raised the issue again, thinking that he was backward and could not be helped, and it was never resolved for him." District cadre Sun Jiancheng said: "Jin Ming in our village was the tail of the landlord Zheng Yueting. He is a basic member of the masses. Instead of mobilizing and educating him, we hated and isolated him. The first time we divided the fruits, we deliberately counter-inserted the bottle for him." Government comrades also examined their past "landlord" stance, which was very harmful to mobilizing the masses. The special agent landlord Gao Jizu was struggled against and ran to the government, where he was still treated as a guest. Shen Yuqin said: "Chairman Mao is taking the mass line, but we are not accepting the opinions of the masses. When dividing the fruits, I divided a few mu of wheat land. In the future, when setting the direction of production, we must take the mass line." After the examination, they were all determined to transform themselves in their actual work.

　　黎城五百干部
  　努力学习提高自己
    【本报黎城讯】中共黎城县委书记刘健夫同志在纪念七一祝党公开大会上，号召每个共产党员和群众代表学习毛主席思想作风，努力提高自己，带领群众支援大反攻。尤其是党公开后，每个党员并要忠实于群众带领群众自求解放，虚心坦白敢于自我批评，争取再立功。在县委会亲自领导下，五百余县区村干部党员和群众代表，开展学习、检查自己。霍家窑樊书文说：毛主席思想是要忠心为群众，我是开会时说为群众，实际工作中就把群众忘了，特别是看不起落后人，也不去发动他，咱有些自私，今后学习毛主席时时不忘群众。后＠群众代表李松会说：“我父亲放了十七年牛，我住了二十三年长工，放了几年牛，去年冬天翻了身有了地有了房成了咱的天下啦。对封建地主一点也不能客气。”区干部王火福说：“四二年减租时王和尚租王高氏六亩地，没有从思想去发动代替包办减了租，他黑夜又偷给地主送回、四四年查减中和尚又提出，认为他落后拾不起来，始终没给他解决。”区干部孙建成说：“俺村金明给地主郑月廷当尾巴，他是个基本群众，不去发动教育他，反而仇视孤立他，头次分果实故意给他对插瓶。”政府的同志也检查出以往的，“地主”立场对发动群众危害很大，特务地主高继祖被斗争跑到政府还当客人招待，申玉芹说：“毛主席是走群众路线，咱是不接受群众意见，分果实我就分了几亩麦地。今后定出生产方向，一定走群众路线”。检查后，都决心到实际工作中改造自己。（集体研究、王长群执笔）
