Throughout Southern Hebei Region Heavy Rain
　　Masses in Various Counties Rush to Plant
    Taihang First Military Subdistrict Organs Help Masses Plant After Rain
    [Our Newspaper, Southern Hebei, 3rd Dispatch] After the wheat harvest, Southern Hebei experienced widespread heavy rains, and the masses in various counties threw themselves into a planting frenzy. District Chief Wang of the Second District personally led the liberated masses of the entire district, rushing to plant a total of 83,600 mu in three days. In Lü Village, planting continued day and night. In the Fourth District of Pingyuan, villages mobilized all available manpower and livestock in a large-scale exchange of labor, planting 31,700 mu in three days. The masses unanimously reflected on the benefits of this large-scale labor exchange. In the Ninth District of Jing County, after the rain, work on dam construction was halted and switched to a planting blitz, planting over 50,000 mu. All late seedlings were planted, and now preparations are actively underway for mutual aid in weeding. In Jize County, the entire county completed 150,000 mu in ten days. In the new district of Gaotang, "re-inspection and rush planting" were closely combined, and the county successfully completed its planting tasks. During the rush planting, women and children both gathered wild vegetables and sowed seeds while planting. Wangzhai created a blitz method, planting all the village's fallow land. In Qinghe Gaozhuang, after the rain, 480+ mu of fallow land was planted, and all wheat stubble was planted. Now, except for a very few areas where planting is not possible and spot planting continues, other areas where planting is complete are preparing for mutual aid in weeding.
    [Our Newspaper Comprehensive Dispatch] The Taihang First Military Subdistrict experienced widespread rain from the afternoon to the evening of June 21st. Some areas had heavy rain. The first and second districts of Lincheng, the first and second districts of Yuanshi, the first and second districts of Gaoyi, the fourth district of Jingxing, and the second district of Zanhuang received about three or four fingers of rain, enough for timely planting. Six or seven villages, including Nanpingwang and Yangze in Zanhuang, four or five villages, including Changhe in Huolu, and Daying Village in Gaoyi, also received two or three fingers of rain, enough to plant in low-lying areas. After the rain, the leadership grasped the situation tightly. On the 22nd, the special commissioner's office issued an urgent telephone directive to each county: seize the opportunity to organize all, semi-, and auxiliary labor forces to rush to plant. All organs should suspend office work, extract all available manpower and livestock, and help resident villages or nearby villages to rush to plant. At the same time, the Jixi Daily also published an editorial entitled "Seize the Time to Rush to Plant While It Rains," calling on the organization of all labor and livestock to seize the time to rush to plant. Areas that did not receive heavy rain should educate the masses to overcome the idea of waiting for heavy rain and seize the opportunity to rush to plant and replant. Areas affected by locust plagues should break through feelings of despair and quickly replant early-maturing crops and beans. Currently, the Taihang First Administrative Region, the Public Security Sub-bureau, the Industry and Commerce Sub-bureau, and the Jixi Cooperative have extracted all available manpower and livestock. The cooperative's director and Secretary Zhao personally led the team to participate in pulling plows, totaling 36 people and nine head of livestock, helping to plant more than 60 mu in one day, with plans to complete all planting within three days. Gaoyi, Lincheng, and other counties have also issued urgent instructions. In the Fifth District of Gaoyi, because the rain was not widespread, the district leaders gathered village cadres to discuss good ways to organize labor. Villages that did not receive rain should support villages that did receive rain, using methods such as contracting work, selling labor by the day, or exchanging labor to adjust labor resources, and mobilizing the masses to invite relatives and friends to provide support and help, or to borrow livestock. Currently, the entire district is actively providing mutual aid and support in a planting blitz.
