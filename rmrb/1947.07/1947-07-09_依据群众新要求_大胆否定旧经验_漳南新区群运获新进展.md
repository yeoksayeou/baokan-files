　　Based on New Demands of the Masses, Boldly Reject Old Experiences:
　　New Progress in the Mass Movement in Zhangnan New District
　　[Reported by this newspaper from Jinnan on the 7th] The Zhangnan New District has broken through the old experience of first carrying out the "speak bitterness" sessions and then distributing the fruits of victory. They have adopted a method of completely letting go, speaking out, struggling, and distributing at will, resulting in tremendous development of the movement. Since the county distributed the land of the traitor Mai Tian to the masses, the masses have further demanded land, wanted to eat their fill, and wanted revenge. However, our cadres' leading ideology was restricted by the old experience of mobilizing the masses in the old liberated areas – first letting the masses speak bitterness to raise class consciousness, then taking action themselves to detain landlords, then launching struggles, and then distributing the fruits of victory, fearing that if the fruits were distributed, the masses would not be mobilized, resulting in a "cock-and-bull story" – and delayed the large-scale mobilization by four or five days. Later, the leadership realized that this approach was incorrect. At the beginning, after detaining the landlords, they mobilized the masses to sort out the property and distribute the fruits of victory, distributing as they struggled. The masses' emotions immediately soared. Those who previously dared not join the farmers' association also signed up voluntarily, those who had previously had concerns no longer had them, and activists dared to come out and take the lead, and the organization grew stronger. In Jianfu Village, it was previously impossible to hold meetings, but after implementing the new policy of letting go, the situation completely changed. Although the masses in the new district naturally have many concerns, they have suffered severe exploitation from the local tyrants and reactionaries, and their demands for food and land distribution are even more urgent. As long as they are given something, they dare to take it. Anyway, things have already been distributed, so "once you've started, you might as well finish the job". Speaking bitterness, fiercely struggling against landlords and traitors, and launching a vigorous mass movement. However, when distributing the fruits of victory, it is necessary to first satisfy the demands of the poor peasants and implement the principle of leveling and making up the differences.

　　依据群众新要求  大胆否定旧经验
  　漳南新区群运获新进展
    【本报冀南七日电】漳南新区突破先诉苦后分果实的旧经验，采取完全放手随诉随斗随分的办法，运动获得巨大的发展。该县自将汉奸麦田分给群众后，群众更进一步要求土地，要吃饱饭，要报仇。但我们干部领导思想上存在着先让群众诉苦，提高阶级觉悟，自己行动起来，扣押地主，再开展斗争，然后分果实，惟恐果实分了群众没发动起来，“鸡飞蛋打”，被老区发动群众旧经验圈套所限制，把大发动推迟了四、五天。以后领导上体验到这种作法不对，一开始就在扣押地主后，发动群众进行清理财产，分果实，随斗随分，群众情绪立即高涨起来。从前不敢参加农会的也自动报名了，以前有顾虑的也不顾虑了，积极分子也敢出来带头了，组织壮大起来。见伏村以前会就开不起来，实行新的放手方针后，完全改观。新区群众固然顾虑多，但他们受的封顽剥削厉害，要求吃饭分土地更迫切，只要给就敢要，反正已经分了东西，“一不作二不休”，诉苦大斗地主汉奸，掀起如火如荼的大动局面，但在分果实时必须掌握首先满足贫苦农民的要求，实行填平补齐。
