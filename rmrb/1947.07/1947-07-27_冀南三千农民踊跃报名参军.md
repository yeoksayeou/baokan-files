　　Hebei South Three Thousand Farmers Eagerly Enlist
[This newspaper, Hebei South, 25th dispatch] The liberated farmers of Ji County are eagerly requesting to join the army to welcome "August 1st" and advance to the counter-offensive front. Within three days, 3,124 people have registered with the county's conscription committee, including 490 party members, 654 workers, and 1,593 poor peasants. They are all determined to fight to protect their land and liberate their oppressed brothers in the KMT-controlled areas. The masses are giving them victory cigarettes and holding feasts to send them off. They bid farewell to their fellow villagers, saying: "When we return, the revolution will be successful!"
[This newspaper, Hebei South, 22nd dispatch] On the eve of "August 1st," over 400 liberated KMT officers swore to join the counter-offensive army and fight back to their hometowns. The second team of liberated KMT officers in the officers' training regiment of the Hebei South Military Region, after half a year of study, have recognized that Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial and traitorous rule is coming to an end. On the eve of "August 1st," they collectively swore to join General Liu Bocheng's southern expeditionary counter-offensive army, fight back to their hometowns, and save their fathers, elders, brothers, and kinsmen. Except for the sick and disabled, 470 people have applied, accounting for over 80% of the total number of the team. They were extremely excited after their requests were approved by their superiors. Captain Zhang, the artillery company commander, said: "I committed great sins in the past. From now on, I will wholeheartedly serve the people and make contributions to the people to wash away Chiang Kai-shek's stain." They unanimously expressed: "We are willing to be soldiers in the People's Liberation Army. We cannot just go home empty-handed."

　　冀南三千农民踊跃报名参军
    【本报冀南二十五日电】冀县翻身农民纷纷请求入伍，以迎接“八一”，走向反攻前线，三天内到县参军委员会报名者，已有三千一百二十四名，其中党员四百九十人，工人六百五十四人，贫农一千五百九十三人，他们都带着为保卫土地、解放蒋管区被压迫的弟兄们而战。群众给他们送胜利烟、摆酒欢送，他们向乡亲告别说：“我们回来的时候，革命就成功了！”
    【本报冀南二十二日电】四百余名被解放之蒋军官于“八一”前夕宣誓参加反攻军，要打回老家去。驻冀南军区军官教导团被解放的蒋军军官第二队，经半年学习，已认清蒋贼独裁卖国统治，已到寿终正寝之日，“八一”前夕集体宣誓要参加刘伯承将军南征反攻大军，打回老家拯救自己父老兄弟，除病残者外，目前已达四百七十名，占全队总数百分之八十以上。他们的要求经上级批准后，极为兴奋。上尉炮兵连张连长说：“过去自己罪恶很大，今后一心当个人民的勤务员，为民立功，以洗净蒋介石的污点。”他们一致表示：在解放军当个兵也干，叫我们空空回家算不行。
