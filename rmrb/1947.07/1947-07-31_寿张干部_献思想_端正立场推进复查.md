　　Shou Zhang Cadres "Offer Thoughts"
　　Correcting Stance and Promoting Re-examination
　　[Our newspaper's dispatch from Jilu Yu on the 29th] Shou Zhang's districts have launched a "offer thoughts" campaign to strictly correct the cadres' stance, establish poor peasant backbones, and vigorously carry out the re-examination movement, breaking ground in more than 40 backward villages. In mid-June, various districts convened district cadres and activist-positive elements conferences. After the proposal of "offering thoughts" at the meeting, village activists offered landlord and rich peasant thoughts such as unstable stance, not being ruthless towards landlords, and distributing too many fruits, which further enhanced their awareness. After the meeting, various villages held poor peasant associations and peasant congresses to speak out their grievances and offer their thoughts, expose landlords to specifically draw a clear class line, clean up alien elements in the peasant women's association organization, and study strict control measures for landlords. On "July 1," farmers in various villages celebrated the Party's birthday, recalled their emancipation, and discussed re-examination, enhancing the Party's ideological leadership over farmers. Xibailing, a previously unpenetrated village in Baiban, this time, poor peasant Wang Wenzhang and woman Lü Aixiang returned to the village from the district and guided the peasants to thoroughly re-examine. Sun Nali, a tired village in the first district, had superficially conducted a purge, but the village cadres and landlords lived peacefully together. Now the village has convened a poor peasant association with less than one mu of land, directly handing over policies and rights to them, and letting them freely deliberate. Several poor peasants immediately spoke out their grievances, and a re-examination committee was established at the meeting, implementing control and detention of all seven landlord families in the village. Fifteen or sixteen poor peasant activists led the masses of the whole village to investigate. Zhukou Village, a famous feudal fortress with more than a thousand households, was visited in-depth by Comrade Zhang Jianyin, the district secretary, who investigated the situation in the whole village for two days and two nights. He then concentrated more than 30 cadres and militiamen from the district's mobile force to control more than 70 landlords, disrupting the old ruling order like a thunderbolt. The masses were excited, and a peasant congress of more than 2,000 people was convened to establish a re-examination committee and launch a purge. Currently, the re-examination movement in more than 40 villages is developing in depth.
