　　[This newspaper, Xingtai News] Under the leadership of Labor Hero Comrade Wang Junsheng, Shuimen Village in the Ninth District is preparing for famine with a long-term plan, with every household in the village conducting a family asset calculation. The entire village consists of 118 households with 404 people. Among them, 37 households do not have enough grain to eat, and will be short 45 shi of grain by the next wheat harvest. After this calculation, each household changed their diet. For example, Zheng E'ni's family of four used to eat 1.5 sheng of grain every day. After the village-wide calculation, they now eat 1 sheng per day, saving 0.5 sheng of grain, and mix corn flour half and half with bran. Under the slogan of "Every household calculates, everyone saves," the entire village has saved over 1,920 jin of grain in just over ten days. Due to the poor wheat harvest and the drought, saving alone is not enough. Each group must find ways to subsidize the famine. Currently, the entire village has collected 7,600 jin of wild vegetables and 2,400 jin of small persimmons. Wheat is ground into flour and taken to Shanxi to exchange for corn to subsidize the famine. Twelve households ground 390 jin of flour, exchanging it for 1,396 jin of corn. Wheat bran is being stored for the famine, with eleven households storing 360 jin. All seven groups in the village planted 53 mu of radishes and vegetables, and are opening another 38 mu of wasteland on the back slopes to grow vegetables to subsidize the famine.
    [Another News] Labor Cooperative Hero Yao Dezeng investigated that more than 70 mu of dry land and drought-stricken seedlings in the village had not been replanted. On May 19th, he went to Shuiliandong and Songzhuang to buy 79 jin of red radish seeds, 8 jin of white radish seeds, and 12.5 jin of turnip seeds for the masses, spending a total of 81,300 yuan in foreign currency, enough for the entire village to plant. The red and white radishes planted by the masses before the rain on the 16th are about to sprout, and those who have not planted will prepare to plant everything on July 16th and 17th. The masses said, "The cooperative truly serves our people!" (Wei Ling, Jing Yi)

　　劳英王俊生领导算家当
  　水门十天省粮两千斤
    【本报邢台讯】九区水门村在劳英王俊生同志领导下，备荒从长期打算，全村家家户户进行算家当帐。全村一百一十八户，四百零四口人，还有三十七户粮食不够吃，如吃到明年麦天，还缺四十五石粮食。经这样计算，各户改换了饭食。如郑娥妮：全家四口人，在没计算前平常每天吃到一升半粮食，全村计算后，每天吃到一升，节约半升粮，吃玉茭面要对半掺糠。全村在“户户算帐，人人节约”的口号下，经十余天行动已省粮一千九百二十余斤。由于麦季歉收，旱灾已成，只从省吃俭用也不够，各组要找出路补助灾荒。现在全村打野菜七千六百斤，拾小柿子二千四百斤，麦子不吃推成面，到山西换成玉茭补助灾荒。十二户推面三百九十斤，换玉茭一千三百九十六斤。麦糠存起来准备渡灾荒，十一户存三百六十斤。全村七个组，种萝卜菜五十三亩，背坡再开三十八亩生荒，种上菜补助灾荒。
    【又讯】折户合作英雄姚德增调查了该村因有七十多亩旱地、和旱死苗的地还没捉住苗，便于五月十九到水涟洞、宋庄给群众买回红萝卜籽七十九斤、白萝卜籽八斤，蔓菁籽十二斤半，共用洋八万一千三百元，足够全村种。群众于十六日雨前种的红白萝卜将要出土，没种的在七月十六号和十七号准备全部种上。群众说：“合作社可真为咱群众服务的。”（维伶、景义）
