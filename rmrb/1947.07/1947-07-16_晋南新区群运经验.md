    Experience in Mass Movement in the Jinan New District
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 13th dispatch] The land reform movement in the newly liberated areas of the Jinan triangular zone has been launched in sixteen counties. Based on the progress of the movement, the area can be divided into three types: (1) In five counties, namely Xinjiang, Jilu, Wenxi, Xiaxian, and Pinglu, the land reform has been universally carried out throughout the entire territory. (2) In six counties, namely Wanquan, Anyi, Yishi, Ronghe, Jishan, and Hejin, the breakthrough of key points has now begun, gradually moving towards comprehensiveness. (3) Yuxiang, Yongji, Linjin, Jiexian, and Ruicheng started later, but due to the people suffering deeply from the exploitation of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan, the movement is developing very rapidly.
    The main experiences in launching the movement in the three types of areas are as follows: First, start with the urgent demands of the masses. For example, when the struggle in Yishi began, the masses wanted to oppose the "village compilation" corruption, but the cadres wanted to struggle against the landlords first. As a result, the struggle could not be launched for half a month. In the end, the demands of the masses were approved to carry out revenge against the landlord, traitor, and special agents, and a vigorous struggle was launched. Second, close relations with the masses and paying attention to enlightening the masses can fully mobilize the masses and make the struggle intense. For example, the masses in Ronghe initially did not dare to directly open fire on the landlords and demanded that the cadres first detain the criminals. We immediately implemented this, and the villages of Dongwangzhuang, Ducun, and Kangu immediately launched struggles. Third, support the masses and embolden them, and eliminate ideological concerns. In the third and fourth districts of Jilu, war criminals were suppressed, stubborn and puppet organizations were destroyed, and registration of puppet personnel was carried out. In Anyi, the detention of special agent district chief Dong Zhifang broke the ideological concerns of the masses and increased their courage, shifting from secret complaints to open struggle. Fourth, to fully mobilize the masses, it is necessary to go through telling grievances, digging out the roots of disaster, and digging out the roots of poverty to enlighten the masses' consciousness. The masses in Jilu and Weima villages jointly struggled against Zhang Peizhang, the head of the "reverse calculation." Farmer Sun Wei spoke with tears in his eyes, pointing to Zhang's nose and complaining. In this way, they not only dared to take back the property that had been "reverse calculated," but also dared to protect the fruits of their gains.

    晋南新区群运经验
    【本报太岳十三日电】晋南三角地带新解放区的土地改革运动，已在十六个县内展开。从运动发展的进度上，可以分作三种地区：（一）新绛、稷麓、闻喜、夏县、平陆等五县，土地改革已在全境普遍进行。（二）万泉、安邑、猗氏、荣河、稷山、河津等六县现已开始突破基点，逐渐走向全面。（三）虞乡、永济、临晋、解县、芮县开始较晚，但由于群众深受蒋阎压榨，痛苦极深，运动开展甚为迅速。
    三种地区开展运动的主要经验有以下几点：第一、先从群众迫切要求入手。如猗氏斗争开始时，群众要反“编村”贪污，干部却要先斗争地主，结果半个月未搞起斗争来，最后还是批准群众要求，对地主奸霸特务施行报复，展开了轰轰烈烈的斗争。第二、密切与群众关系，重视启发群众觉悟，才能充分发动群众使斗争激烈。如荣河群众开始不敢直接向地主开火，要求干部先将罪犯扣起来。我们立即执行了，于是东王庄、杜村、看谷等村立即展开了斗争。第三、为群众撑腰壮胆，解除思想顾虑。稷麓三、四区，镇压战犯摧毁顽伪机构，进行登记伪人员。安邑扣押特务区长董志芳，打破了群众思想顾虑增加了群众的胆量，由秘密诉苦转向公开斗争。第四、要充分发动群众必须经过诉苦、挖祸根、挖穷根，启发群众自觉。稷麓、尾马村群众，联合斗争倒算头子张佩章，农民孙维一句一泪，指着张逆的鼻子诉苦。这样不仅敢于要回被“倒算”的财物，而且勇于去保护所得的果实。
