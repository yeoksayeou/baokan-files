Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 20th: Wang Keqin, the renowned enemy-killing hero of General Liu Bocheng's troops, unfortunately sacrificed heroically in the battle to annihilate the 63rd Division and 153rd Brigade of the Chiang army in Dingtao on the 10th of this month. Before the battle, Wang Keqin was sick in bed with heatstroke. He only started eating a little on the 6th. His superiors and comrades in the entire platoon advised him to rest in the rear temporarily, but Wang Keqin was determined to perform meritorious service for the people in the great counter-offensive. At the mobilization meeting of the entire company, he proposed: guarantee the completion of the assault mission, abide by discipline, the whole platoon listens to command; compete to request to be the assault platoon. As the attack began on the evening of the 10th, under the cover of our powerful artillery fire, Wang Keqin led the entire platoon in a charge in the main attack direction of the north gate. He was the first to rush through the Chiang army's barricades and jump over the outer trenches. Just as he was about to climb the city tower, he was shot and wounded by enemy machine guns. After being wounded, Wang Keqin calmly said to the soldiers: "Each squad's machine guns provide good cover, take good care of the mutual aid group leaders, rush up quickly, don't worry about me." Under the slogan of "Avenge the platoon leader," Huang Dashun, Cao Wenlong, Zhao Fenming, the three mutual aid group leaders, and Chong Shili, the third squad leader, led the assault team to launch a fierce charge at the enemy, breaking through the front line and first climbing the city wall. They repelled four enemy counterattacks, and subsequent troops poured in. By 12 o'clock, all the enemies inside the city were annihilated by us. Just as the battle was coming to a victorious end, Wang Keqin died gloriously in the forward hospital due to severe blood loss and lack of timely treatment. When Wang Keqin was at the aid station, he was unconscious due to excessive blood loss. After being revived with a cardiotonic injection, he told the reporter: "Please tell Chairman Mao that even when I die, I am serving the poor and performing meritorious service for the people." He also thought of the challenge letter his comrade-in-arms, the hero Shi Yulun, had sent him before the battle, saying: "Please tell him that I don't have time to reply. We must learn from him and launch a revolutionary competition." Finally, Wang Keqin said: "Tell all the comrades in the regiment to unite, help each other, fight old Chiang well, and perform meritorious service for the people." Wang Keqin was from Anhui. He was liberated by our army in the Ping-Han Campaign in October 1945 and joined the People's Liberation Army, serving as a machine gun shooter in the first company of a certain unit. After the Patriotic Self-Defense War, he successively served as deputy squad leader, squad leader, deputy platoon leader, and platoon leader. He joined the Party in October 1946 and was an excellent Communist Party member. He was twenty-six years old. After Wang Keqin's glorious sacrifice, everyone in the frontline troops mourned him. They are determined to further launch the Wang Keqin movement to commemorate this famous patriotic enemy-killing hero and people's merit citation winner. (Attached picture)
