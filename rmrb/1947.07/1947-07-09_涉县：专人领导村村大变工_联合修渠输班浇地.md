　　【Report from Shexian】Shexian has achieved great results and opened up a new situation since the district construction assistant held an emergency drought prevention and famine preparation meeting on June 19. There are two characteristics of this rapid development: First, the combination of understanding the masses' thoughts and solving the actual problems existing in the canals. For example, after inspection, it was found that in Suobao in the second district, there were still 6.5 mu of paddy fields and 14 mu of irrigated land unplanted (water is readily available, just needs irrigation). An old canal in the east of the village could irrigate 40 mu of land with just ten or so workdays of repair, but nothing was done. The masses' thinking was, "We have already planted some paddy fields and feel settled, so we don't want to panic again," "We are afraid of delaying work, and opening large canals would incur labor costs," "We think we shouldn't have another disaster after just getting through the previous one," "Cadres lack confidence in leading the opening of large canals," "In the past, paddy fields had burdens; whoever irrigated would be taxed according to the paddy field yield, and those who didn't irrigate would be taxed according to the dryland yield." After understanding these thoughts, they were discussed and resolved among cadres and the masses. A water conservancy committee was established, and repairs were rushed through. In addition, the old canal in the east of the village was repaired. Construction has already begun, and after "July 1st," a new canal will be opened in the northwest of the village. Using about 300 workers, it can irrigate more than 100 mu. The street canal was mobilized by the Chamber of Commerce for repairs, which can irrigate more than 30 mu of land. The two canals from Nanguan to Zhaishang and Tanli to Nanguan in the ninth district have historical conflicts between villages. The upper reaches change the water while the lower reaches are irrigating, resulting in anger and fighting, and causing disunity. This time, a joint meeting was held, based on the slogan that farmers should unite greatly after liberation, and the disputes over the joint canal of Beiguan to Qiyuan and nine villages were resolved. Because there was not enough time to allocate shifts for irrigation, it was decided to divide the area into economic zones according to water potential and the number of fields, and to irrigate in shifts. Each economic zone has a special person responsible for notifying the person when it is their turn to irrigate. This saves labor and irrigates quickly, about one-third faster. Everyone is preparing to repair the canal after this irrigation to increase water pressure and expand the irrigation area, and to carry out water pumping and planting. From the above villages, the masses have the demand for repairing canals and irrigating, but some specific problems must be solved, otherwise, it cannot be carried out. Second, there is the issue of organization and leadership. The masses have the demand for irrigation, but it cannot be completed by one or two households. It requires mobilizing the whole village or several villages to do a good job, which requires a leader. The reason for the rapid development this time is that the district construction assistant is specifically leading the opening of canals. Water conservancy committees have been established in villages along the river, and a water conservancy committee member (deputy director of production) has been newly elected. For example, the Suobao Water Conservancy Committee is composed of the deputy village head, the director of the Farmers' Association, the director of production, and the newly elected water conservancy committee member. These people are specifically responsible for surveying, calculating, and solving specific problems. Then, the canal is divided into sections, and the number of workdays for each section is determined. The masses are then organized to carry out a large-scale labor exchange between irrigable and non-irrigable land, forming groups. After completion, accounts are settled uniformly, converted into market price wages in rice, and apportioned according to the number of irrigated mu and the workload. This makes work progress quickly. (Wen Bin, Zhisheng, Huafeng)

　　【Another News】In order to overcome natural disasters, Shexian is now stepping up the repair of canals. Under the personal leadership of County Chief Qin, the Yongshun Canal in the east and west of Dachang in the sixth district is being repaired. The four villages of Miaokou, Yuanbenmiao, Hanlou, and Yangtiezhuang in the fifth district are using 270 workdays to repair a canal that can irrigate more than 2,000 mu of land. Baicha in the seventh district is also starting to repair canals, which will increase paddy fields by more than 300 mu after repair.

　　【Report from Handan】From the Fuyang River bank between the two villages of Hejiazhuang and Ganhegou in the urban area to the old ditch east of the Martyrs' Cemetery and into the city river, the length is 1,375 zhang, the width of the ditch mouth is more than 2 zhang, and the width of the ditch body is generally more than 1 zhang and 3 to 4 chi deep. The nearby masses and organ cadres actively participated, and it was completed in just two weeks. Digging branch ditches on both sides can irrigate more than 13,000 mu of land. The masses all said, "This ditch is an unfinished plan from more than 50 years ago. Now we can open canals and irrigate, which is a benefit given to us by the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army!" After the village cadres mobilized the masses in Nanxinzhuang, explaining that people can conquer nature, that having a well means eating without relying on the sky, and that planting one day earlier can produce more grain, they broke the mindset of waiting for rain. Now, there is not a single idle well in the whole village, and all irrigable land has been planted with seedlings. For land that cannot be irrigated, they try to divert water for spot planting. Many masses in the village, recalling the hardship of the famine in 1932, have begun to eat wild vegetables to save millet and have voluntarily organized mutual aid groups to dig wild vegetables.

　　涉县：专人领导村村大变工
  　联合修渠输班浇地
    【本报涉县讯】涉县自六月十九日召开了区建设助理员紧急防旱备荒会议后，已获得很大成绩，已经打开了局面，这次能很快的开展有两个特点：第一、了解群众思想与解决水渠存在的实际问题给合：如二区索堡经过检查，发现还有六亩半水地和十四亩打水地没有下种，（水现成光用浇一下就行），村东一条旧渠修一下用十来个工浇四十来亩地也没动。了解群众思想是“都有点水地下了种，安住了心，不想再受张慌”，“怕误工，开大渠怕出工资”，“认为才过了灾荒不该再过吧”，“干部没信心领导开大渠”，“过去水地负担，谁浇就按水地产量，不浇就按旱地产量”。了解这些思想后，便在干部群众中酝酿解决，成立了水利委员会，突击修好。此外并将村东旧水渠修通，现已动了工，“七一”后开始在村西北新开一条水渠。用工三百来个，可浇一百多亩，当街水渠动员商会修一下，可浇场地三十余亩。九区南关至寨上、滩里至南关两条水渠有村与村的历史矛盾，下边浇上边改水，不是生气就是打架，闹不团结，这次召开了联合会，本着农民翻身后要大团结的口号，解决了北关至七原九村联合渠纠纷。轮班浇地时间不够分配，经研究后按水势地数划分经济区，挨班浇地，每个经济区内有专人负责，到谁地边通知谁浇，这样既省劳力又浇的快，快了三分之一，现已全部浇完下了种。大家并准备浇了这遍再把渠修一下，可加大水力，扩大浇地面积，开展打水下种。一区漳南八村联合大渠坍了一空木桥，另改水渠须工五千多，因上边能浇，出工如一亩一工下边常浇不上不愿意。经研究解决，按水势分五段摊工，解决后这水渠已快完工，能浇二十多顷。六区西达永顺渠决定加大水力，现正赶修，能浇一百六十余亩。从以上村庄来看，群众是有修渠浇地的要求，但有些具体问题必须解决，否则即不能开展。第二、组织领导问题；群众既有了浇地要求，但却不是一户二户可完成的，就需要动员全村或数村才能做好，这就得有出头人，这次开展快的原因，由区建设助理员专门领导开渠，沿河村庄均成立了水利委员会，并增选一个水利委员（生产副主任），如索堡水利委员会由副村长农会主任生产主任及新选的水利委员组成，这些人专责进行测量计算，解决具体问题后即把渠划成段，确定了每段的工数，即组织群众进行能浇地与不能浇地的大变工，编成组、完工后统一算帐，按市价工资米折合，按浇地亩数摊派，按活计工，这样做的快。（文彬、志胜、华峰）
    【又讯】涉县为战胜天灾，现正加紧修渠，在秦县长亲自领导下，六区东西达城正重新修理永顺渠。五区庙口、原本庙、韩楼、洋铁庄四村，用工二百七十个修渠一道可浇地两千余亩。七区白芟也正动手修渠，修好能增加水地三百余亩。
    【本报邯郸讯】自市区之贺家庄干河沟两村之间的滏阳河边起，直到烈士陵园前转东边旧沟入城河，长一千三百七十五丈，沟口宽二丈余，一般沟身宽丈余，深三至四尺，附近群众及机关干部踊跃参加，费时仅个两礼拜就完成了，两边再挖支沟共可浇地一万三千余亩。群众都说：“这沟是五十多年前未完成的计划，现在咱们能开渠浇地，是共产党八路军给咱们的好处呀！”南辛庄群众，经过村干动员，说明人定胜天，有井吃饭不靠天，早种一天就能多打一些粮食，打破了等着下雨的思想。现全村没有一口闲井，已把所有能浇的地都种上苗，不能浇的地，想法拨水点种。该村许多群众，回想起三十二年灾荒的艰难，已开始吃野菜，节省小米，还自愿组织互助组挖野菜。
