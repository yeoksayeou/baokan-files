Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. The fact that the Chiang government is protecting Japanese war criminals and Nazi bandits has aroused attention and condemnation from Chinese and foreign public opinion. According to a United Press report on the 13th, Chinese newspapers in Shanghai revealed that Japanese residents in the Hongkou district of Shanghai are being treated favorably by the Chiang family authorities. They live as comfortably as they do in their own country and oppress their Chinese neighbors, "exhibiting an unbearable arrogance." Many of the Japanese residents are engaged in espionage work, but Chiang's officials call them "technicians" and "advisors." Furthermore, according to an Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 24th, the Nationalist authorities are allowing many of the most brutal Nazis to "escape" repatriation and, in some cases, obtain good jobs from Chinese plutocrats. This fact has been condemned by English-language newspapers in Shanghai. Dong Xianguang, director of the Chiang regime's Executive Yuan Information Bureau, was subjected to many questions about this matter at a press conference in Nanjing on the 24th, and Mr. Dong did not dare to answer directly.

　　日战犯及纳粹匪徒竟为蒋介石所庇护
    【新华社陕北廿六日电】蒋政府庇护日本战犯及纳粹匪徒之事实引起中外舆论之注意与谴责。据合众社十三日消息，上海中国报纸曾揭露上海虹口区的日侨受到蒋家当局的优待，他们象在他们本国一样如意地过生活，并欺压其中国邻人，“表现出一种不能令人忍受的傲慢”。日侨中有许多乃系从事特务工作者，但蒋家官方却称他们为“技师”与“顾问”。又据美联社南京二十四日电称：国民党当局允许许多最凶暴的纳粹“逃避”遣送回国，并在某些场合从中国财阀那里得到好的工作，此事实受到上海英文报纸之谴责。蒋记政院新闻局长董显光二十四日在南京记者招待会上受到有关此事的许多质询，董氏未敢正面答复。
