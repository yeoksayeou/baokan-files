Two Paths to European Economic Recovery
	Contradictions Between the US, Britain, and France Become More Obvious After the "European Conference," and Economic Cooperation Between Southeast European Countries and the Soviet Union Develops Greatly
	The world's attention has been focused on the major issue of European economic recovery in the past week. On this issue, there are currently two distinctly different approaches and paths.
	One approach is the so-called "European Recovery Conference" that opened in Paris on the 12th, which was initiated by Britain and France under the instigation of US imperialism. The conference only lasted four days and ended hastily on the 15th. The proceedings of the conference, in addition to revealing a pre-arranged charade, further exposed the political nature of the so-called "Marshall Plan." Regardless of how the British and French representatives tried to defend the United States at the meeting, saying that the meeting had "no political purpose," the Greek fascist representative revealed the essence of the Marshall Plan when he explained it at the meeting. He said: "The political and economic concepts of the Marshall Plan are the same as the concepts that the United States uses to provide economic and financial assistance to Greece, only in a more open and long-term form." On the third day of the conference, Marshall himself admitted this in a public speech in the United States. He said: "The United States must complete its task of assisting its overseas friends, otherwise it will inevitably watch its friends move in directions that contradict American traditions." At the same time, the establishment of a "Western European bloc," especially the restoration of Ruhr coal and steel production to support the resurgence of Nazism, has also become a key part of the Marshall Plan. However, it must be pointed out that the conference was conducted under "inauspicious omens." First of all, the refusal of eight countries, including South, Czech, Romania, and Bulgaria, to participate gave the US, Britain, and France's attempt to isolate the Soviet Union a heavy blow. Secondly, the concerns and repeated questions raised by countries such as Sweden, Denmark, and Switzerland about the Marshall Plan at the meeting, and their opposition to splitting with Eastern European countries, forced the French Foreign Ministry spokesman to admit the "disunity" of the meeting. At the same time, only a few days after the close of the so-called "European Recovery Conference," public opinion expressing dissatisfaction with the Marshall Plan is rising in Britain and France, and calls for opposing the reactionary foreign policies of Bevin and Bidault are also rising. Even the underlying contradictions between the British and French authorities and the United States have recently become more apparent due to the Ruhr coal mine dispute and the consequences of various restrictions imposed on Britain by the US-British loan agreement. The United States attempts to "take the lead" in the Ruhr coal mine through a $300 million loan to Germany, while Britain and France fear that if the United States monopolizes the Ruhr, it will endanger their own industrial production. Therefore, Bevin requested a postponement of the relevant meeting between Britain and the United States on this issue, while France repeatedly opposed increasing Ruhr production and insisted on participating in the British-American negotiations. At the same time, only one year after the US-British loan agreement, the serious adverse effects on the British economy caused by the harsh terms of the US loan have made the British authorities unbearable. The deadline for Britain to abandon the Sterling Bloc as stipulated in the loan agreement has expired; and the $3.75 billion loan has also been devalued by half due to the abolition of US price controls; this has forced Britain to angrily demand that the loan terms be revised. The results of the Paris "European Conference" have not yet appeared, but internal contradictions have become increasingly obvious. At the same time, it is reported that British-Soviet trade negotiations are still continuing. These situations illustrate that the so-called coordination between Britain, France, and the United States is only superficial and temporary; in its bones, there are serious divisions and struggles. This even made Truman's right-hand man, Connally, express "doubt" about "whether European countries can cooperate closely to formulate an effective reconstruction plan." It is already clear that this road is bound to fail.
	The other approach is in stark contrast to the "European Recovery Conference" with its sinister aggressive intentions, and that is the great development of economic cooperation between the new democratic countries of Southeast Europe and between them and the Soviet Union. Recently, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union signed a five-year agreement, followed by the Soviet Union and Hungary, Hungary and Finland, Finland and Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Albania, all of which have signed similar agreements for the exchange of goods. These agreements are based on self-reliance and equal mutual assistance. This approach and this path, as the Soviet Pravda stated, "is a reliable guarantee for European economic recovery and the cause of European peace." (July 22)

　　欧洲经济复兴的两条道路
  　“欧洲会议”后美英法矛盾更露骨东南欧各国与苏经济合作大发展
    一周来世人的注意力都集中在欧洲经济复兴的这一重大问题上。在这一问题上，目前存在着显然不同的两种做法与两条道路。
    一种做法是十二日在巴黎揭幕的所谓“欧洲复兴会议”，这是在美帝国主义策动下由英法出面发起而召开的。会议仅开了四天，即于十五日草草结束。会议的进程，除表现了一幕事先布置好的圈套剧外，更暴露了所谓“马歇尔计划”的政治性。不管英法代表在会上百般替美国辩护，说会议“毫无政治目的”，但希腊法西斯代表在会上解释马歇尔计划的精义时，却泄露了天机。他说：“马歇尔计划所有的政治经济观念，与美国所据以给希腊经济财政援助的观念相同，只是采用更公开与长期的形式而已。”在会议开会的第三天，马歇尔在美公开演说中亦供认不讳。他说：“美国必须完成对海外友人的援助的任务，否则必致眼看各友人向与美国之传统相抵触的方向行动。”同时，建立“西欧集团”，尤其是恢复鲁尔煤铁生产以扶植纳粹东山再起，也成为马歇尔计划的关键。但必须指出：会议是在“不祥之兆”的情况中进行的。首先，南、捷、罗、保等八国的拒绝参加，给了美、英、法妄想借此孤立苏联的企图以最沉重的一击。其次，在会中瑞典、丹麦、瑞士等国对马歇尔计划的忧惧与屡次提出质问，而且他们反对和东欧国家分裂，这迫使法外交部发言人也不得不承认会议的“不团结”现象。同时，所谓“欧洲复兴会议”闭幕才几天，在英法国内，对马歇尔计划表示不满的舆论便在抬头，反对贝文与比道尔的反动外交政策的呼声亦在兴起。甚至英法当局与美国之间潜在的矛盾，最近亦因鲁尔煤矿之争，以及美英贷款协定所加予英国各种束缚的后果而更形显露。美国企图经过对德三亿美元的贷款，来对鲁尔煤矿“执掌牛耳”，英法则恐惧一旦美国独占鲁尔，势将危及它们本身的工业生产。因此贝文要求延期召开英美对这一问题的有关会议，而法国一方面一再反对鲁尔增产，一方面则坚主参与英美的谈判。同时，英美贷款协定才一周年，但由于美国贷款的苛刻条件所招致对英国经济的严重恶果，已使英国当局忍无可忍。贷款协定条件所规定英国放弃金镑集团的期限已经届满；而卅七亿五千万美元的借款，也由于美国物价管制的取消而跌价一半；这迫使英国激愤地喊出修改贷款条件的要求。巴黎“欧洲会议”成果未现，内部矛盾反而愈来愈露骨起来。同时，据悉英国与苏联的贸易谈判仍在继续中。这些情况说明了：英法美间的所谓协调，只是表面的暂时的；其骨子里，却存在着严重的分裂与斗争。这就连杜鲁门的左右手康纳利，对“欧洲国家能否密切合作以订立一有效之重建计划”，亦大表“怀疑”。这条路的必然走不通，已是洞若观火的了。
    另一种做法是与抱有阴险侵略目的之“欧洲复兴会议”恰成鲜明对照，这就是东南欧等新民主国家之间以及它们与苏联之间经济合作的大发展。最近捷克与苏联签订了五年协定，接着苏联与匈牙利，匈牙利与芬兰，芬兰与保加利亚，南斯拉夫与阿尔巴尼亚，都先后签订了类似的物资互换协定。这些协定都是在自力更生的基础上实行平等的相互协助。这种做法与这条道路，正如苏联真理报所称：“才是欧洲经济复兴与欧洲和平事业的可靠保障”。（七月二十二日）
