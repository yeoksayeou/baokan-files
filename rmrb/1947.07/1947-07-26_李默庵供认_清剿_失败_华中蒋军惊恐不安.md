Xinhua News Agency, Central China, July 24th: Li Mo'an, commander of the Chiang Kai-shek's First Pacification Zone, confessed that the "Suppression Campaign" in northern Jiangsu failed. According to the captured Pacification Zone Order No. 0762, "Strengthening Defense," it stated: "Upon investigation, the remaining bandits (a derogatory term for the People's Liberation Army) in northern Jiangsu (referring to the area north of the Yangtze River) gather in small groups and harass our local troops by taking advantage of the gaps. As a result, officers and soldiers everywhere are terrified and live in constant fear. Even district and township chiefs have abandoned their posts and fled abroad, which is shameful and painful." Then, he reviewed the reasons for his failure, admitting that "the troops are complex, the command is not unified, and the quality of the cadres is too poor, especially lacking the spirit of sacrifice; "shooting skills are too bad, and the battle only consumes ammunition." Therefore, he had to order his local troops to switch from offense to defense. His standard was: "Those with a strength of about 100 men and guns must hold out for 24 hours, those with about 200 men must hold out for 48 hours, and those with about 300 men must hold out for more than 96 hours." However, when the People's Liberation Army recaptured Sanyu Town on the 8th of this month, it took only four hours to completely annihilate and capture more than 300 members of the Chiang Kai-shek's Nantong County Security Team.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, July 24th: A certain company of the Jianghou Jingjiang children's regiment in central Jiangsu has annihilated four companies of Chiang's puppet troops in the past year, seized enough equipment for two full companies, and has become a model for persisting in the heartland of Chiang's troops on the north bank of the Yangtze River. In the battle, ten special-class meritorious heroes, thirty-nine people who were awarded major merits, and one hundred and six people who were awarded minor merits emerged.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, July 24th: In June, the masses on both sides of the Hai'an-Taizhou line behind Chiang's forces in central Jiangsu launched a widespread demolition campaign, destroying 16 enemy strongholds such as Han's Well, Yagu Village, and Hongqiao, and demolishing seven important Chiang's puppet transportation routes such as Rugao-Huangqiao, Rugao-Xinshenggang, and Fenjiezhen-Guxi. The blockade trench wall on the west side of the Rugao-Xinshenggang road, which was as long as ten miles, was also completely destroyed.

　　李默庵供认“清剿”失败
  　华中蒋军惊恐不安
    【新华社华中二十四日电】蒋记第一绥区司令官李默庵自供在苏北“清剿”失败。据缴获之绥字第零七六二号“加强防务”命令中称：“查苏北（按指长江以北地区）地区残匪（诬指解放军）每聚零为整，乘隙窜扰，专以打击我地方部队为对象，各地官兵遂致草木皆兵，惊惶不可终日，并有区乡长擅离职守，逃避境外者，殊属耻痛。”继即检讨其失败原因，承认“部队复杂，指挥未臻统一，干部素质太差。尤缺乏牺牲精神；”“射击技术太坏，战斗徒消耗弹药”。因此他只得叫他的地方部队转守为防，其标准是：“人枪实力在一百左右者，须坚守廿四小时，二百左右者，须坚守四十八小时，三百左右者，须坚守九十六小时以上。”但本月八日，解放军再克三余镇时，仅四小时即将蒋记南通县保安队三百余人全部歼俘。
