    People of Songjiazhuang, Ningnan,
    Continue to Investigate "Underground Treasures"
    [Our Jinnan dispatch, July 14th] The people of Songjiazhuang are investigating "underground treasures" to completely eliminate feudalism. Li Zhuzi, the local tyrant and landlord of Songjiazhuang in the Second District of Ningnan, has already undergone two united mass struggles. Not only was a large amount of land and floating wealth recovered, but he was also executed by the government because he colluded with bandits to kill people and forcibly seize land. At that time, the leadership believed that the demands of the masses had been completely satisfied. Recently, the masses unanimously felt that the struggle was not yet thorough. During production, the masses discussed a re-investigation to thoroughly investigate his "underground treasures" (hidden materials). After several days of struggle, a total of more than ten *shi* of grain, 350 agates, 2 gold rings, 277 silver dollars, 77 silver rings and tinware, 11 clocks and watches, 57 bottles of Western medicine, 5,000 *Ji* currency, 230,000 *Jin-Cha-Ji* Border Region currency, numerous Chiang currency, fur coats, fur mattresses, single clothing, silk, cloth, and furniture were recovered, as well as a telephone and a gramophone. The masses said, "These are all things extorted from us." Some said, "I still recognize the things that were forcibly taken from me." The unanimous opinion of the masses is: "Landlords have a thousand layers of nets, but they cannot escape the people's thorough struggle." The investigation is still continuing.

    宁南宋家庄群众
    继续追查“地下宝”
    【本报冀南十四日电】宋家庄群众追查“地下宝”，彻底消灭封建。宁南二区宋家庄的恶霸地主李珠子，先已经过二度联合大斗争，不仅收回大量土地浮财，并且因为他勾结土匪杀害人命强霸土地，政府将其枪决。当时领导上认为是彻底满足了群众要求，最近群众一致感觉斗争还不彻底，在生产时群众酝酿复查，要彻底追查他的“地下宝”（隐藏物资）。经过几日的斗争，计追回粮食十余石，玛瑙三百五十个，金戒指二个，现洋二百七十七元，银环锡器七十七件，钟表十一个，西药水五十七瓶，冀钞五千元，晋察冀边钞二十三万元，蒋币、皮袄、皮褥及单衣绸缎、布匹，家具甚多，并有电话机、留声机各一部。群众说：“这全是讹诈咱们的东西”。有的说：“强霸我的东西我还认的哩”。群众一致舆论：“地主不过千层网难逃群众斗干净。”现仍在继续清查中。
