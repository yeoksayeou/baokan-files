Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th – According to a TASS dispatch from New York: Several American business figures and independent economists believe that the U.S. economy is showing signs of decline. Official production statistics show a gradual reduction in manufacturing output over the past two months. According to a report by the Federal Reserve, both light and heavy manufacturing production declined in May. The industrial production index compiled by the Bureau has fallen from 190 in March to 186 in May. In light industry, cotton consumption in May was 10 percent lower than the peak in November of last year, and wool consumption fell even further, reflecting the decline in production. The employment index also fell from 154.7 in March to 152.2 in May. At the same time, a dollar crisis has occurred in the capitalist world. This crisis will inevitably severely hit American export trade and accelerate the arrival of the American economic crisis. For example, Newsweek recently stated: "The current prosperity in the United States is mainly due to huge exports. And most of these exports are paid for by American taxpayers in the form of loans and credit loans. This prosperity has become hollow, and the longer it continues and the higher it rises, the heavier it will fall." Financial magazines also stated: "If exports, which play an important role in maintaining the American economy, shrink at a time when people's purchasing power is even lower, then the country will encounter an extremely serious crisis."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th – According to a TASS dispatch from New York on the 5th: According to analysis, the U.S. government's statistics bureau's figure of only 2.5 million unemployed in the United States recently fails to reflect the actual situation in the United States. For example, in the number of employed persons listed in the Department of Commerce Statistics Bureau's report on May 10th, 1.76 million people only worked one to fourteen hours per week, including people who worked unpaid for a few hours on farms and in household side businesses, people who were temporarily laid off, and people who were only hired for a few hours per week; these people actually have no fixed jobs. In addition, the unemployment statistics do not include 1.6 million unemployed veterans. Thus, the total number of unemployed people in the United States should be about 5.86 million. Last year, there were also facts that American official statistics did not match the actual situation. According to the Economic Chronicle, at the end of last year, there were more than 5 million unemployed people in the United States, but the Department of Commerce's statistics only showed 2.12 million.

　　美国经济已呈衰落
  　制造业产量逐渐减缩
  　失业者已近六百万人
    【新华社陕北九日电】据塔斯社纽约电：若干美国商界人士与独立经济学家认为，美国经济已呈衰落。官方关于生产的统计显示两月来制造业产量的逐渐减缩。据联邦储备局报告，轻重制造业生产五月份均呈衰落。该局所制订的工业生产指数已自三月的一九○降至五月的一八六。在轻工业中，五月棉花消费量较去年十一月的最高数字少百分之十、羊毛消费量降得更低，反映着生产的跌落。就业指数亦自三月的一五四·七降至五月的一五二·二。与此同时，资本主义世界又发生了美元危机。这一危机必然会严重打击美国的出口贸易，加速美国经济危机的到来。倒如，美国新闻周刊最近载称：“美国目前的景气，主要是由于巨大的输出而得继续。而此输出之大部分，是由美国的纳税者以贷款、信用贷款的形式来偿付的。这种景气已成了空心的，它继续越久，升得越高，那将跌得越重。”金融杂志亦称：“如果在维持美国经济中起着重要作用的输出，恰在人民购买力更为低落的时候缩小了，那么国家将遭遇极严重的危机。”
    【新华社陕北七日电】据塔斯社纽约五日电：据分析的结果，美政府统计局关于美国最近失业人数仅及二百五十万人之数字，远未能反映美国实况。例如商务部统计局五月十日报告所表列的就业人数中，有一百七十六万人每周只工作一小时至十四小时，其中包括在农场及家庭副业中无偿工作数小时的人、暂时被裁人员及每周仅被雇数小时的人；这些人实际上无固定职业。此外，该统计失业人数项下设有包括一百六十万无业的退伍军人。如此，则美国失业总人数当约及五百八十六万人之多。去年亦有美国官方统计与实际情况不符的事实。据经济纪事报称：去年年底美国失业者达五百万人以上，但商务部的统计则仅及二百一十二万人。
