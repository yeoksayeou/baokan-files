【Report from our newspaper, Jilu Yu, 28th】 Women in the sixth district of the newly recovered Juancheng County gathered to enthusiastically discuss carrying out the revenge and counter-reckoning movement. Due to landlords colluding with enemy puppets during the enemy occupation period, extorting and slaughtering the masses, and the urgent need to resolve the issues of revenge and food, the county was unable to quickly carry out the anti-traitor revenge and counter-reckoning movement because many peasants participated in war service and dike repair work. The leadership then vigorously organized women to participate in the struggle. The sixth district held a district-wide women's members' meeting on the 15th of this month to discuss anti-traitor revenge and counter-reckoning. The women said, "We didn't dare to say anything when the enemy was here, but now that our own people are here, let's pour out our bitterness!" Aunt Chang from the old city recounted the circumstances of her husband's death at the hands of the landlord: "He was buried alive, and the landlord wouldn't even let us take the body. We dug out the body but didn't dare to raise it, hiding it under a peach tree until it was dark. When we dug him out of the pit, he was still tied with two ropes and his face was covered in blood." Aunt Xing said: "When the landlord was taking things away, he cursed: If you don't deliver one less thing to the hall, I will beat you to death even if you are standing at the door." They exposed the landlord's conspiracy, recognized the landlord's viciousness, and unanimously resolved to take revenge. The meeting also discussed the methods of revenge and counter-reckoning. After returning to the village, they immediately organized a review and liquidation committee. Now, influenced by the example of one thousand women in the sixth district, all the women in the district are engulfed in the torrent of anti-traitor revenge and counter-reckoning.

【Report from our newspaper, Jilu Yu, 28th】 Women in Hanlou, the fifth district of Juancheng, are enthusiastically participating in the struggle against traitors, for revenge, and for counter-reckoning. During the enemy occupation, landlord Zhang Yingcai of Hanlou led the landlords in the village to reverse grain and land distribution. He ran away with the enemy, and his wife was equally evil, forcing farmer Gao Deming to reverse grain. The wife of landlord Zhang Yangui reversed 20,000 yuan of Jicha and 420,000 yuan of Chiang Kai-shek's currency from the peasants. When his house was demolished during land reform, she wanted to reverse the money for the lime and bricks. Some of the clothes she was given were torn, and she insisted on having the original ones back. The women detained the two landlord women and ordered them to return the things they had reversed to the farmers door to door. When the landlord women brought the reversed things to them, the peasant women put on airs and said: "We don't want it. Didn't you want us to reverse it to you?" Only after the landlord women apologized and pleaded did they accept the things.
