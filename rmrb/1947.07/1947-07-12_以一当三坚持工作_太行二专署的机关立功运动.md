The spring plowing work teams of Yushe, Xiangyuan, and Pingding set off, followed by another large group of people participating in the war. Two-thirds of the cadres and three-quarters of the messengers were gone. Although there were fewer people and more tasks, the work was finally completed due to the launch of the labor emulation movement. Comrade Wang Shiyou of the Finance and Grain Section held three positions, doing auditing, serving as finance accountant, and assisting with cashier work, ensuring that none were delayed. Clerk Li Zaiqing also did mail delivery work. Cook Li Shanfa carried water alone (originally two people) and also supplied water for the families of five cadres. Messenger Qiao Maoyu braved the rain to travel on errands, returning in one and a half days for a three-day journey. Other cadres and odd-job workers also worked hard, promoting each other and doing their daily work well. In terms of production, the office and the groups cultivated a total of 47 mu of land, all deeply plowing and carefully planting. The communications class failed to do a good job in group production last year and did not complete their task, but they did well this year. The cooking class had no assigned tasks, but the comrades consciously reclaimed three mu of wasteland to grow melons and vegetables. The office group has already completed three-quarters of its annual vegetable production task. The Justice Section spun more than four jin of thread. Messenger Qiao Maoyu spun three and a half jin of thread in his spare time. It is precisely because of everyone's high enthusiasm for production that as long as the production committee mentions going to the fields, everyone comes eagerly. This overcomes the sluggish phenomenon of pushing and pulling, without pushing and without moving, from last year. At the same time, the results of frugality are also very significant. The office's average monthly expenditure last year was 550,000 yuan, but this year it only spent 300,000 yuan. Because the comrades have consciously established the view of cherishing material resources, frugality has become a movement in the office. The kitchen saves coal. Peng Yunsheng and Ju Yucai burned the coke into ash and mixed it into mud for use on small fires. Odd-job worker Li Ruilin diligently wipes the lamps and uses thin wicks, saving three jin of oil in three months. The telephone operator makes his own electricity and does not need to buy batteries for half a year. The clerk collects the small pieces of paper cut off and uses them to print passes and write slips. The comrades in the office save paper and pens. The office uses waste paper, saving enough office paper for half a year. The following are a few experiences in carrying out the labor emulation movement:
	(1) Eliminate various ideological concerns.
	At the beginning, the following ideas were commonly found: 1. Do not seek merit, but seek no fault; there is no need to mention labor emulation in doing revolutionary work. 2. Some people believe that the leadership has fixed views and are afraid that merits and demerits will offset each other, making it impossible to earn merit. 3. It is difficult to speak up about one's own merits. 4. Some people believe that leaders who participate in the war, go to the countryside to lead land reform, and leaders can earn merit, but clerks and odd-job workers in the office cannot. When solving these ideological concerns, we grasped the following points: 1. Grasp the activists and typical groups (odd-job worker groups) in the groups to discuss and understand the essence of the first two types of thinking, and inspire revolutionary consciousness. Point out that not seeking merit but seeking no fault is the ideological essence of old civil servants doing their jobs routinely and just getting by; today we are working for ourselves, so we must treat the revolution as our home, be actively responsible and creative, everyone should earn merit, do a good job to quickly defeat Chiang Kai-shek, and be a loyal servant of the masses. At the same time, the leadership conducted a review of the past and affirmatively stated that everyone can earn merit and everything can earn merit. Merits and demerits will never be offset; one point of goodness is one point of merit. Being able to make achievements based on the existing work foundation and improving the work is merit. A labor emulation committee was established, and the odd-job worker groups were the first to report and record merits (the work of odd-job workers is the most concrete, and merit is easy to define). Grasp the core and activists, demonstrate to the whole, and clarify what is merit, so that each comrade further clarifies: any position can earn merit. Combining self-reporting of merit with others supplementing merit, without obliterating every comrade's good points and merits.
	(2) Launch a labor emulation movement on the basis of gradually improving revolutionary consciousness.
	After the comrades established the concept of a large family, they clarified for whom they were working and for whom they were busy. They were working not only for the revolution but also for themselves. Comrade Liu Tangde of the general affairs department said: The revolutionary organization is my home. I work in the office, which means I work for myself. On the basis of the comrades' active, intense, conscious, and enthusiastic work, we reviewed past work and clarified the good and the merit. Everyone evaluated and selected, and promoted their skills. This made the comrades even more enthusiastic and active. Whenever the communications class had a task, the comrades always competed to do it, afraid of falling behind. Everyone took a step forward in their thinking and became of one mind.
	(3) Promote revolutionary friendship and mutual assistance to advance the work.
	Due to the gradual awareness of the comrades, a criticism and self-criticism movement was launched, forming an atmosphere of unity and overcoming the bad phenomena of mutual exposure and mutual cover-up in the past. The leadership paid attention to praising positive factors. In the past, the kitchen had a mechanical division of labor, but now the person carrying water helps with the bellows and chopping vegetables after finishing carrying water; those who grow vegetables help the stableman cut grass and feed the livestock when they come back. If one person in the construction section cannot sow seeds, the comrades in the civil affairs section help, forming mutual assistance in work and mutual assistance in earning merit.
	(4) Report outstanding merits and evaluate everyone's good points:
	In the merit evaluation movement, the groups first reported the merits to start deliberation and discussion, and finally the collective evaluated the merits, following the mass line; so that each comrade understood each other's merits, and everyone evaluated and selected. However, in reporting merits, it is necessary to highlight the merits, without omitting anything; if one cannot report one's own merits, others will supplement the report, such as Comrade Shang Xian, who was embarrassed to talk about his own merits, so the comrades in the Finance and Grain Section supplemented the report. The scope of merit in the evaluation should be broad, and mastery of a skill should be grasped to praise each comrade's good points and strengths. Some comrades said: Clarifying all the good points makes it easier for us to learn and figure things out in the future. This is indeed of great help to mutual learning, learning from each other's strengths, and overcoming one's weaknesses. At the same time, pay attention to discovering confused understandings and further clarifying and improving them in the merit evaluation; for example, during the collective merit evaluation, someone suggested that because rat droppings were found in the rice, the kitchen could not earn collective merit. We immediately pointed out that merits and demerits should not be offset. The shortcomings should only be pointed out as imperfections that need attention. Everyone clarified that earning merit should point out the areas that should be paid attention to while promoting the advantages, and promoting merit upon merit.
	(5) Mutual assistance to earn great merit.
	Through the labor emulation movement, the relationship between cadres and odd-job workers and the relationship between cadres have been improved; the comrades' collectivity has been further promoted, and mutual assistance to earn merit has been advanced. Because the comrades clarified for whom they were working and for whom they were busy, everyone could be a famous hero, and no merit would be buried, so not only individual merit should be earned, but also collective merit. Cook Li Shanfa said: The whole body is steel and cannot make a few nails (referring to the small role of individual merit), our cooking class must twist into a single rope, everyone earns small merit, and the collective earns great merit, merit upon merit. Under his influence, the cooking class was unprecedentedly united and worked hard, achieving personal hygiene, kitchen cleanliness, and delicious and fragrant food; they also saved materials and promoted the enthusiasm and creativity of each comrade, and the collective earned great merit. The comrades in the cooking class happily said: Our kitchen has individual merit and collective merit, truly merit upon merit.

    以一当三坚持工作
    太行二专署的机关立功运动
    子唐
    榆社、襄垣、平定春耕工作组出发之后，紧接着又走了一大批参战人，干部走了三分之二，交通员只剩四分之一。虽然这样人少任务多，但由于开展了立功运动，终于完成了工作任务。财粮科王士友同志一身三职，做了审计还兼了财政会计并帮助出纳工作，做到互不耽误。文印员李再清同志兼做收发工作。炊事员李善发同志一人担水（原两个人）还供了五家干属的吃水。通讯员乔懋玉同志冒雨走差，三天路一天半回来。其他干部和杂务人员也努力，互相推动，把日常工作做好。在生产上，机关与小组共种地四十七亩，都深耕细作的下了种。通讯班去年的小组生产没搞好，没完成任务，今年也搞好了。炊事班没有任务，但同志们自觉的开荒种瓜菜三亩。办公室小组种的菜已完成全年任务的四分之三。司法科纺线四斤多。通讯员乔懋玉个人抽暇纺线三斤半。正由于大家的生产情绪高，只要生产委员会一提上地，大家就踊跃而来。克服了去年推推动动，不推不动的疲塌现象。同时，节约成绩也非常显著，机关去年每月平均开支五十五万元，今年只花三十万元，由于同志们都自觉的树立了爱惜物力的观点，机关节约已形成了运动；伙房节约炭，彭云生、巨玉才把焦炭烧成灰后，和成泥供小火上用。勤务员李瑞林勤擦灯，改用细灯心，三个月节约三斤油。电话员自己配电半年不用买电池。文印员同志把裁下的小纸条集存起来，供印通行证和开条使用。同志们办公节约纸与笔，办公室使用废纸，节约出半年办公纸。开展立功运动中有如下几点经验：
    （一）解除多种多样的思想顾虑。
    开始普遍发现了以下几种思想：一、不求有功，但求无过；做革命工作就无须提立功。二、一部分人认为领导上有固定观点，怕功过相抵不能立功。三、自已有功，难开口报功。四、有一部分认为参战、下乡领导翻身、领导人能立功，住机关科员杂务人员不能立功。解决这些思想顾虑时，我们掌握了以下几点：一、掌握积极分子与典型组（杂务人员组）在小组中讨论，认识一二两种思想本质，启发革命自觉。指出不求有功但求无过是旧公务员公事公办混饭吃的思想本质；今天是给自己工作，就得把革命当成家，积极负责发挥创造，人人立功，做好工作快快打垮蒋介石，才是群众的忠实勤务员。同时，领导上对已往做了检查，肯定提出人人能立功，事事能立功。决不功过相抵，有一分好就有一分功，能从现有工作基础做出成绩，把工作提高就是功。成立立功委员会，从杂务人员小组先行报功记功，（杂务人员的工作最具体，功易明确）。掌握核心与积极分子，示范全体，明确什么是功，使每个同志进一步明确：任何岗位都能立功。自己报功与别人补功结合，不抹杀每个同志的一点好与一点功劳。
    （二）从逐渐提高革命自觉基础上掀起立功运动。
    同志们树立了大家庭观念后，明确为谁工作为谁忙。既为革命也为自己。事务员刘唐德同志说：革命组织就是我的家，我在机关工作，就是给我工作。从同志们主动紧张自觉热情工作的基础上进行检查过去工作，明确好与功，大家评选，发扬一技之长，这样同志们更热情积极了。通讯班每逢有任务，同志们总是争着做，光怕自己落后，大家在思想上推进了一步，都变成一条心。
    （三）发扬革命友爱，互助推进工作。
    由于同志们的逐渐自觉，开展了批评与自我批评运动，形成团结空气，克服了过去相互揭发，相互包庇的坏现象。领导上注意了表扬积极因素。伙房过去是机械的分工，现在却是担水人担完水就帮助拉风箱与切菜；种菜的回来就帮助马夫切草喂牲口。建设科一人下不了种，民政科同志就帮助，形成了互助工作，互助立功。
    （四）报突出的功劳，评每人的好处：
    在评功运动中，先由小组报功展开酝酿讨论，最后集体评功，走了群众路线；使每个同志相互了解功劳，大家评选。但在报功中要突出功劳，一点不遗；自己报不出来，别人补报，如尚贤同志不好意思谈自己功劳，财粮科同志给补报出来。评功中功的范围要广，掌握一技之长，做到表扬每个同志的好与长。有的同志说：把好都明确出来，咱在今后学习就容易捉摸。这的确给相互学习、取长补短有很大帮助。同时在评功中要注意发现糊涂认识，进一步明确提高；如在集体评功中，有人提出饭里吃出老鼠屎来，伙房不能立集体功，我们即提出功过不相抵，不够的地方只美中不足要引起注意。大家明确了立功要从发扬优点中指出应注意的地方，推进功上加功。
    （五）互助起来立大功。
    经过立功运动，改善了干杂关系与干部关系；更加发扬了同志们的集体性，推进互助立功。由于同志们明确为谁工作为谁忙，人人能富有名英雄，一点功绩不被埋没，所以不仅个人立功，而且要集体立功。炊事员李善发说：全身是钢打不成几个钉（指个人立功作用小），咱炊事班要扭成一股劲人人立小功，集体立大功，功上再加功。在他影响下，炊事班空前团结，紧张工作，做到个人卫生，伙房清洁，抉择食清香适口；还节省了东西，发扬了每个同志的热情与创造，集体立了大功。炊事员同志们高兴的说：咱伙房是个人有功，集体也有功，真是功上加了功。
