    Pingshun Increases Postal Speed
    Integrating Trunk and Township Postal Services
    Switching to Round-Trip Routes, and Reducing Village Messengers

    [This newspaper Pingshun News] In order to further strengthen the connection between the front and the rear, and support the great counter-offensive, the county government and the postal bureau convened a meeting of district secretaries on June 18th. Based on the existing foundation, they researched and developed the following methods to increase the speed of township postal services:

    (1) Closely integrate county trunk lines with township postal lines and clarify the division of labor. Originally, the county trunk lines and township postal lines each managed their own affairs on the same route. After the universal switch to daily delivery from every-other-day delivery from June 8th to the districts, the coordination became insufficient, resulting in fast delivery at the top but not at the bottom. After research, it was decided that Zhangjing Village in District 1, five villages including Nanhe in District 3, Yanggao in District 4, and Hei Hu Zhao Cheng Village in District 7 would all be delivered by the county trunk lines. The county trunk lines would not reach the District 4 office; instead, the connection would be made on the Yantuo township postal line. This would increase the speed by half a day and save two laborers. (2) Improve the speed of township postal services and reduce village messengers. According to statistics from six districts, there are 77 township postal lines of various sizes, with 781 township messengers, and 77 people are dispatched every day. After precise calculations at the meeting, villages that could be converted to round-trip routes were converted as much as possible. The number of township messengers in the six districts was reduced by 81%, and the number of township postal lines was reduced by half, saving seven laborers per day, and 2,520 laborers per year. (3) Implement labor exchange for township postal messengers throughout the district. After research at the meeting, the township postal messengers would exchange labor at the rate of ordinary mutual aid team wages, with the amount contributed by all those who should perform duties in the district. However, village messengers must also contribute service grain, so that the burden is shared equally. (Lu Ying, Jin Zhijun)

    [This newspaper News] Neiqiu District 3 is rectifying township postal services. The entire district is divided into five sub-districts. Each sub-district has one person dedicated to delivering mail every day (with villages in the sub-district taking turns to be responsible). Whoever is responsible for delivering mail on a given day goes directly from home to the district, takes the mail, and then transfers it to each village. Regardless of whether there is mail for a particular village, they must reach all the villages and the number of miles that should be transferred according to regulations. If a village has mail going to the district, the messenger picks it up and gives it to the messenger who should come to the district to deliver mail the next day. In this way, five people can complete the transfer for the entire district in one day. There is a delivery book for the handover procedures, and important letters are registered, with whoever delivers the mail being responsible. Each village establishes a transportation station, which is managed by the small school cooperative. If there is no cooperative, a dedicated person is selected to be responsible. All mail sent to the village by the transportation and all mail going out of the village are distributed by this person. The transportation sends mail directly to the transportation stations in each village. This saves 32 laborers per day compared to before, and letters and newspapers are also much faster. Letters from the district can reach each village on the same day, and letters from the village can also reach the district on the same day.

    The number of messengers is calculated based on the labor force in each village, with large villages contributing more and small villages contributing less. The amount of work is calculated according to the service system, with one day of delivery counting as one day of work, and half a day counting as half a day. The method of recording work by the sounding also makes the burden average.

    平顺增快邮速
    干线乡邮密切结合
    改行轮回线缩减村交通员
    【本报平顺讯】为了更加强前后方连系，支援大反攻，县府与邮政局于六月十八号召开各区秘书会议，按现有基础研究出如下几种乡邮增快速度办法：
    （一）县干线与乡邮线密切结合、明确分工。原来县干线与乡邮线在一条线上都是各管各，六月八号到区隔日制普遍改为逐日投递后，更配合不够，形成上快下不快，经研究决定一区张井村、三区南河等五个村、四区羊高、七区黑虎赵城村都由县干线投递，县干线不到四区公所，在烟驼乡邮线上接转，这样增快速度半天，节省劳力两个。（二）改进乡邮速度，减少村交通员。据六个区统计，大小乡邮线七七条，乡交通员七八一人、每天有七七人出动。经会议精确计算，把可能改轮回线的村尽量改为轮回线。六个区乡交通员即减少百分之八十一、乡邮线减少一半，每天省劳力七个，全年可节省劳力二千五百二十个。（三）乡邮交通员实行全区变工。经会议研究，乡邮交通员以一般互助组工资米变工，由全区应服勤务人摊出，但乡村交通员也必须出差役米，这样可使负担平均。（路英、晋之俊）
    【本报讯】内邱三区整顿乡邮，全区共分五个小区，每小区固定每天有一人专管送信，（小区各村轮流量担任），每天该谁送信，即由家直接到区，带上信再转各村，无论有无那个村的信，总得按规定应转的里数与村庄悉数到达，如村中有向区走的信，即由该交通员拿起交于第二天应来区送信的交通员。这样全区一天五个人即可转完。交接手续上有送信簿，重要信件都登记上，谁送谁负责。各村建立交通站，由小校合作社代理，无有者选专人负责，凡交通送来本村信件与本村往外走的信件都由他负责分发。交通送信就直接到各村的交通站即可。这比以前每天省劳力三十二个，信件报纸也快得多了，区的信当天就能到达各村，村的信也能当天到区。
    交通员按各村劳力计算，大村多出小村少出，按支差法计算顶工，送一天就顶一天，半天就顶半天，又实行按晌记工办法，负担也平均了。
