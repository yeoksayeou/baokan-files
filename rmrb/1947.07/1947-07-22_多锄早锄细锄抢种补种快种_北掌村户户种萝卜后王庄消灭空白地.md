    [Reported by this newspaper] In Linqing, over 600,000 mu of autumn seedlings are lush and strong. More than 300,000 mu of sorghum and cotton were planted early in the spring. The sorghum has reached four or five feet in height, and the cotton has reached about one foot. The more than 100,000 mu of rush-planted crops are now also two or three feet tall. The three, four, and eight districts, which suffered more severe droughts, also rush-planted more than 200,000 mu after receiving the welcome rain, and all have emerged. After the heavy rain on the 28th of last month, men and women, old and young, throughout the county worked together to choose land and rush-plant yams. In order to strengthen leadership in production, the County Party Committee convened a county-wide district cadre meeting on June 26th, deciding to launch a hoeing campaign to strive for more hoeing, early hoeing, and fine hoeing. It was also proposed to lead the masses to eliminate pests and capture mole crickets. Some of the replanted land should be rush-planted with autumn vegetables, radishes, turnips, and other crops. After the entire county completes planting and hoeing, it should continue to reclaim wasteland.
    [Reported by this newspaper] In Houwang Village, Fourth District, En County, the masses have ideological obstacles in production. For example, some masses with the idea of relying on the heavens for food said, "If it doesn't rain, we can't produce." Some individual farmers said, "Production is not as good as struggle; it's easier and you get things." Some wealthy middle peasants said, "If we produce more, we'll still be struggled against! Enough to eat and drink is all that matters." In addition, due to the famine, people fled to other places, no one planted, the farmers' association distributed land late, the old, weak, widowed, and orphaned had no one and no livestock, and village cadres were busy with work, etc., the entire village still had 696 mu of uncultivated land, including 150 mu of spring wasteland. Based on these circumstances, the leadership first held mass meetings to mobilize and clear up thinking, and then studied ways to eliminate wasteland. It was unanimously requested that not a single mu of land be left uncultivated in the great production movement. They carried out equivalent exchange labor, guaranteeing to plow and sow the land in three days. All uncultivated land was first harrowed twice and then plowed, and then harrowed once more after plowing. For every mu of land plowed, the landlord households gave the livestock households three jin of millet. After plowing, regardless of whether the land was wet or dry, the method was: first plow or sow the land, use a one-legged drill to sow in the furrows, plant the seeds directly in the wet soil, and then use a Taiping cart to push in the furrows. This way, even in dry conditions, the seedlings will surely emerge. The masses said, "It's better to plant than not to plant, no matter how dry it is," and their enthusiasm is very high. Now, people and animals throughout the village are launching a concentrated effort to plant uncultivated land.
    [Reported by this newspaper] After completing the rush planting in Wu Guan, Jize, all 56 mutual aid teams in the village, under the unified leadership of the old hero Ye Wenzhang and the Production Committee, entered the hoeing campaign. During the hoeing, the families of soldiers were given very thorough care. Under the slogan of "Help the families of soldiers hoe first," based on the amount of labor in each group, the 55 families of soldiers in the entire village (5 qing and 70 mu) were fairly and reasonably distributed to each group, with an average of three mu per laborer. The group leaders made unified plans to ensure the completion of each group's task. Furthermore, based on the distance of residence of each village cadre, a division of labor leadership method was implemented. A total of 12 village cadres were assigned to be responsible for four to five groups each, providing hands-on leadership, and established meeting, reporting, and inspection systems. Currently, the autumn seedlings of the families of soldiers and the masses in the entire village have been hoeed twice and are continuing to prepare for the third hoeing.
    [Reported by this newspaper from Shahe] The Beizhang Cooperative has played a significant role in production. It has helped the masses make three windlasses and spun ten well ropes. Recently, it has also mobilized the masses to plant more red radishes, and has tallied that the masses need 300 jin of red radish seeds, and is now starting to plant (because red radishes will not emerge without a good soaking). The smallest households are planting one mu, and some are planting two or three mu. (Kui Lin)
    [Reported by this newspaper from Lincheng] In the fourth and fifth districts of this county, four fingers of rain fell in early July, and rush planting was universally launched in various villages. Guan Deng Village in the Fourth District borrowed 14 seed drills overnight from areas that had not received rain and allocated them according to labor. All 67 seed drills in the village were mobilized, rush-planting 1,200 mu in one day. Chang Jian spent the whole night without sleep, plowing four mu of land, and only returned after planting. In Nan Sanqi, under the slogan of "Leave no land uncultivated," 25 rush-planting teams were formed, planting more than 800 mu of land in two days. During the rush planting, the 22 mu of land belonging to the families of soldiers were planted first, and the families of soldiers were very happy. In Weichang Village in the Fifth District, under the leadership of the old hero Tian Qingli, after breaking through the masses' negative thinking that "no rain for three years, do not rush to plant," the entire village took action, rush-planting more than 200 mu in one day. After the flat land was planted, more than 100 mu of hillside land was planted. Since the heavy rain, most villages have shifted to hoeing. (Xi Zhen)

　　多锄早锄细锄抢种补种快种
  　北掌村户户种萝卜后王庄消灭空白地
    【本报讯】临清六十多万亩秋苗翠绿茁壮，春季及早下种高粱、棉花三十多万亩，高粱已达四、五尺高，棉花达一尺左右，抢种的十余万亩，现苗亦高二、三尺。旱灾较重的三、四、八区，在获得喜雨后，亦抢种二十余万亩，均已出土。上月二十八日落透雨后，全县男女老少一齐卜地，抢种山药。县委为了加强领导生产，于六月二十六日召开全县区干部会议，决定目前开展锄苗运动，争取多锄、早锄、细锄。并提出要领导群众消除虫害、捕捉蝼蛄，一部分改茬地要抢种秋菜、萝卜、蔓菁等，全县完成下种与锄苗后要继续开荒。
    【本报讯】恩县四区后王庄，群众生产思想有障碍，如有靠天吃饭思想的群众说：“天不下雨，无法生产”。另有个别农民说：“生产不如斗争，又省劲又得东西”。还有的富裕中农说：“生产的多了还是斗争啊！够吃够喝就算啦。”另外该村因灾荒逃外地没人种、农会里分地分的晚、老弱孤寡无人无牲口、及村干部忙于工作等等原因影响，全村尚有六九六亩白地，内未耕的有一百五十亩春荒地。领导上根据这些情况，首先开群众会动员打通思想，然后研究消灭荒地办法，一致要求在大生产运动中不荒一亩地，行等价交换的变工，三天一定把地耕完耩完。凡未耕之地都先耙二遍再耕，耕后再耙一遍。每耕一亩地，地主户给牲口户谷子三斤，耕完后不管湿地干地办法是：先把地耕或耩，用一个腿的耧在沟里种，把种子正种在湿地内，然后用太平车在沟内一推，这样干些也准能把苗出来。群众说：“不管干不干种上就比不种强”，情绪非常高涨，现该村遍地人畜正在突击种白地。
    【本报讯】鸡泽吴官完成抢种后，全村五十六个互助组，在老英雄叶文章及生委会的统一领导下，又进入锄苗运动。锄苗中对抗属照顾非常周到，大家在“先帮抗属锄”的口号下，根据各组劳力多寡，公平合理的将全村五十五家抗属土地（五顷七十亩），分配到各小组内，平均每一劳力合三亩，由组长统一计划，保证完成每组任务。并且又根据各村干居住远近，实行了分工领导方式，全村共十二个村干，每人分工负责四个至五个组，亲手领导，并决定了会议和汇报、检查等制度。现全村抗属及群众秋苗已锄两遍，正继续准备锄三遍。
    【本报沙河讯】北掌合作社在生产中起了很大作用，他帮助群众打了三个辘辘，纺了十条井绳，最近又发动群众多种红葡萄，统计了群众需要三百斤红萝卜籽，现已着手下种（因红葡萄非见蒙头水不出来），最少的户都种亩把，有的种二、三亩。（奎林）
    【本报临城讯】本县四、五区在七月初先后落了四指雨，抢种在各村普遍的展开。四区管等村从没落雨的地区星夜借耧十四张，按劳力进行了配备，全村六十七张耧齐出动，一天抢种一千二百亩。常俭家一夜没睡，耕了四亩地，一直到种上才回来，南三歧在“不留一块白地”的口号下，组成了二十五个抢种组，二天种地八百余亩。抢种中先把抗属的二十二亩地种上，抗属很高兴。五区围场在老英雄田清力领导下，在打通群众“大旱三年不可赶雨种田”的消极思想后，全村行动起来，一天抢种二百余亩，平地种完又种坡地百余亩。自下大部村已转向锄苗。（席珍）
