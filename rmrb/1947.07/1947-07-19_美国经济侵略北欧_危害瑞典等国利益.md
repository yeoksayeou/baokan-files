Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. Moscow dispatch: The "Pravda" on the 14th published a commentary on American aggression in Northern Europe, stating: Since World War II, American exports to Scandinavian countries have increased more than threefold, including more than doubling to Denmark. However, the United States restricts these countries' exports to the United States. Sweden's exports to the United States last year were only a quarter of Sweden's imports of American goods, with a trade deficit of 632 million Swedish Krona. Therefore, serious contradictions have arisen in the foreign trade of Scandinavian countries: their exports are still limited to Europe as before the war, but imports are dominated by American goods, which adversely affects the economic life of these countries. For example, when the Swedish government decided to restrict the import of non-essential American goods, Washington immediately protested and forced Sweden to sign an agreement giving up all import controls. The United States recently proposed lending Norway 10 million yuan, on the condition that Norway must not open steel mills in its own country and must not develop normal relations with Eastern European countries. The conditions for American loans to Denmark are even more explicitly stated to depend on satisfying American requirements for bases in Greenland. The article concludes: American economic encroachment seriously threatens the independence of these countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. Stockholm dispatch: American industrial tycoons are now intensifying their control of Swedish industry, replacing the former position of German capital in Sweden. In addition to launching an "offensive" against Sweden's pulp and paper industry, aviation industry, and mining industry, American capital is also attempting to completely control Swedish oil refineries and the Siemens factories formerly owned by German capital. However, as American capital penetrates deeper, the fact that it conflicts with the interests of the Swedish people becomes more and more obvious. According to the Stockholm Express, the Swedish Parliament's special committee recently passed a bill to monopolize petroleum products, but the bill was stubbornly opposed by American businessmen, who submitted an ultimatum to the Swedish government stating: if the Swedish government insists on monopolizing, it must buy all the American-owned oil factories in Sweden, worth at least 100 million yuan. The Swedish government, lacking US dollars, was forced to abandon the monopoly. At the same time, the remarks of the Swedish representative attending the Paris Conference to a Reuters reporter also reflected the emotional contradictions between American and Swedish interests. The representative said: Sweden's participation in the Paris Conference is more as a supplier than a recipient, because Sweden's problem today is the urgent need to seek markets for its iron ore, only awards, and other commodities.

    美国经济侵略北欧
    危害瑞典等国利益
    【新华社陕北十六日电】莫斯科讯，真理报十四日评论美国在北欧之侵略活动称：二次世界大战后美国对斯堪的那维亚国家的输出，增加了三倍以上，其中对丹麦的输出增加了两倍余，但美国却限制这些国家对美国的输出。瑞典去年对美输出仅及瑞典输入美货的四分之一，美货入超达六亿三千二百万瑞币。因此，斯堪的那维亚国家的对外贸易发生了严重的矛盾：其输出仍和战前一样仅限于欧洲，但输入则美货占绝对优势，不利地影响这些国家的经济生活。例如当瑞典政府决定限制非必需品美货的进口时，华盛顿方面立即提出抗议，迫使瑞典签订一个协定，放弃一切进口管制。美国最近提议向挪威贷款一万元，条件是挪威不得在本国开办炼钢厂，不得为东欧国家发展正常关系。美国对丹贷款条件，则更公开声明以满足美国对格陵兰基地的要求如何而定。该文结尾称：美国经济之侵入，严重威胁着这些国家的独立。
    【新华社陕北十六日电】斯托哥尔姆讯：美国工业界大亨现加紧控制瑞典工业，以代替前德国资本在瑞典之地位。美国资本除对瑞典之纸浆造纸业、航空业、矿业展开“攻势”外，并正图完全控制瑞典煤油厂及前属于德国资本之西门子工厂。但美国资本愈行深入，它和瑞典国民利益相矛盾的事实也愈加明显。据斯托哥尔姆快邮报称：瑞典议会特别委员会最近曾通过专卖石油产品的议案，但该案遭到美国商人的顽强反对，他们向瑞典政府提出哀的美敦书说：如果瑞典政府必欲专卖，则必须买进价值至少达一万万元的美商在瑞典境的一切石油工厂。瑞典政府由于缺乏美元，遂被迫放弃专卖。同时，瑞典出席巴黎会议代表对路透记者之谈话，亦反映出美瑞利益矛盾的情绪。该代表称：瑞典之参加巴黎会议，与其说是领受者，毋宁说是供给者，因为瑞典今天的问题是急需为其铁矿，只奖及其他商品寻求市场。
