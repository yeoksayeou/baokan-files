[This report from our Jinnan office on the 17th] Nangong has resolved the problem of the contradiction between village cadres' production and work. The method is that all village cadres participate in mutual aid teams. As long as they have time, they go to the fields, and the team uniformly records their work points. If they are absent from work due to work (meetings and temporary tasks, etc.), the village office records their work points, and at the end of the year, the office compensates the mutual aid team for the missing work points. If they neither work nor produce, neither the village office nor the mutual aid team records work points. This overcomes the laziness of a few village cadres and is stronger than the previous method of village cadres receiving allowance grain and joining the team, with the team recording half work points. Currently, Xiaozhai Village and Ziguanzhuang in the Second District have begun to implement this, and it is being promoted throughout the county.

[Another dispatch] Nangong Fifth District Xingjia Village cadres recently gathered to study how to ensure that new burden tasks and production do not interfere with each other. The discussion resulted in the formation of a mutual aid team composed of eleven cadres, including the chairman of the farmers' association, the village chief, the village deputy, and the finance and grain affairs officer. They have a total of 226 mu of land, 15 laborers, and 4 oxen. They elected village chief Feng Jinshi as the team leader in charge of work in the village, and farmers' association chairman Xing Erkuang as the team leader in charge of field production. Five people stay at home to carry out the new burden work, and seven people (plus three laborers from their families) go to the fields for production. The district coordinates and dispatches them to meetings. The next day, before dawn, the chairman of the farmers' association used a megaphone to urge everyone to go to the fields, and the village chief also called out in the megaphone, "Hurry up and get up to create the burden!" The field production team weeded 18 mu of seedlings in two days. It is estimated that within this half month, all the land can be weeded, and the burden work can be completely created. Cadre Xing Hengshun said: "If we don't help each other, we can't do anything. Mutual aid is really good. Let's continue to help each other like this for a long time!"

    南宫克服生产与工作矛盾
    村干一律参加互助
    办公下地同时记工
    【本报冀南十七日电】南宫解决村干部生产与工作矛盾问题，办法是村干一律参加互助组，只要有时间就下地，由组内统一记工，如因工作（开会和临时任务等）缺工，由村公所记工，年终结帐时补组内缺工数。如既无工作，又不生产，村公所与互助组都不记工，克服了少数村干部的惰性，且较往年村干部拿待遇粮入组，由组记半工的办法强。现二区小寨村、子贯庄已经开始实行，正向全县推广中。
    【又电】南宫五区邢家村干部，最近集合研究如何使搞新负担与生产两不误。讨论结果是农会主任、村长、村副、财粮干事等十一个干部组成互助组，计共有地二百二十六亩，劳力十五个，牛四头。并选村长冯金石为在村工作组长，农会主任邢二旷为下地生产组长，五人在家搞新负担工作，七人（另配家中三劳力）下地生产，区里开会调配着去。第二天天还不明，农会主任即用大喇叭筒督促大家下地，村长也在喇叭里呼叫“赶快起来造负担啊！”下地生产组两天内锄了十八亩苗。估计在这半月内，能将全部地锄过，负担工作也能完全造起。干部邢恒顺说：“如不互助，啥活也不能做，互助起来真好，以后咱这样长期互助下去吧！”
