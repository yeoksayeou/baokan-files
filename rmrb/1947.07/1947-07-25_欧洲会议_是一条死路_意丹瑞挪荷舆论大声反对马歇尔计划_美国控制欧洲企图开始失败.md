Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: TASS, Moscow - A diplomatic observer for *Izvestia* recently commented on the "European Economic Recovery Conference," stating that because many countries refused to participate, the conference could not be called a truly "European" economic recovery conference. The conference's quick end only demonstrated its extreme fragility, indicating that Bevin and Bidault were merely dictating their will to the "silent representatives of European countries." They were so autocratic that they did not even allow participating countries to discuss the reasons for their invitation. The true significance of the "Marshall Plan" remains unclear to the participating countries. The Greek representative explained the essence of the "Marshall Plan," saying that the "political and economic" concept it embodies is the same as the "economic and financial assistance" that the United States has given to Greece, but in a more open and long-term form. This inadvertently revealed the political objectives of the "Marshall Plan," which Bevin and Bidault were trying to conceal. All of this proves the correctness of the Soviet viewpoint: that American loans will not serve the economic recovery of Europe, but will instead exploit the rivalries among European countries to allow certain powerful nations to sell their intentions to dominate Europe. Because of the strength of democratic forces in many European countries, they are able to defend their political and economic independence in action. American capital's attempt to control Europe, even with the assistance of Bevin and Bidault, has already begun to fail.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: Rome, 19th - Italian newspapers have expressed dissatisfaction with the outcome of the "European Economic Recovery Conference." *Il Giornale d'Italia* stated, "Britain and France invited Italy to participate in the 'European Economic Recovery Conference' in order to obtain something from Italy, not to give Italy anything." "The purely nominal privilege of 'equality' actually becomes the privilege of paying more and getting less." *L'Unità* also stated, "From all aspects of the 'European Economic Recovery Conference,' it is very clear that it does not have the significant meaning that Britain and France claimed, nor has it achieved concrete results." The newspaper pointed out, "The much-hyped 'Marshall Plan' is unrealistic and not even a plan that can serve as the basis for an agreement. In this situation, it will definitely become a plan with great fanfare but little effect." The newspaper also condemned the Italian government's blind support for the "Marshall Plan."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Various sources report that public opinion in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and the Netherlands is strongly opposed to the Marshall Plan. The chairman of the Political Committee of the Danish Parliament, Social Democrat Viggo Fischer, wrote in *Nationaltidende*, "We must uphold our freedom and sovereignty and resist being driven into someone else's pocket." Norway's *Arbeiderbladet* declared that the Nordic countries are unwilling to lose their markets in Eastern European countries. Sweden's *Aftontidningen* published a statement from a leader of the Swedish delegation to the "European Economic Recovery Conference" stating that the Scandinavian countries refuse to give up their markets in Eastern Europe in exchange for "cooperation" in the Western European economy under the "Marshall Plan." Dutch Labor Party member of parliament, G.H.J.A. Hofstra, declared that American interference in the Netherlands' economic life has reached an unprecedented level. Like many other European countries, we are in a very difficult situation and forced to borrow from the United States, thus becoming extremely dependent on the United States economically. Recent history has taught us that loans are being used as a means of political pressure, forming a hidden threat to the free development of our country. People should not forget that the United States has only one reason for helping Europe: to fear its own impending economic crisis. The Dutch newspaper *De Waarheid* also stated that the purpose of the Marshall Plan is to place the entire political and economic life of Western European countries under American control; the Dutch government's approval of this plan has aroused great anger among progressive people.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: Budapest - A reporter for the Hungarian newspaper *Népszava* wrote an article entitled "Difficulties and Anxieties of the European Economic Recovery Conference," stating that more and more representatives of the participating countries believe that it would be more appropriate to wait for the foreign ministers' conference in November to resolve the issue of European economic cooperation. In the meantime, the basic conditions for the possible participation of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries in the agreement should be prepared through appropriate diplomatic channels. The reporter also pointed out that Truman's recent statement that "the United States does not intend to convene a special session of Congress to discuss the Marshall Plan" has greatly disillusioned the representatives of the participating countries. Therefore, some people are saying, "What's wrong with those who doubt whether the United States will generally provide loans?"

　　“欧洲会议”是一条死路
  　意丹瑞挪荷舆论大声反对马歇尔计划
  　美国控制欧洲企图开始失败
    【新华社陕北二十日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报外交观察家顷评论“欧洲经济复兴会议”称：由于许多国家拒绝参加，该会决不能称为是“欧洲的”经济复兴会议。会议的迅速结束，只是显示其十分脆弱；说明了贝文与皮道尔在会中只是把他们的意旨吩咐给“默默无言的欧洲国家的代表们”。他们如此独断专行，竟致不许与会国讨论其被邀赴会的理由。与会各国对“马歇尔计划”的真正意义，至今仍是茫然。希腊代表曾解释“马歇尔计划”的精义说：该计划所具有的“政治经济”观念与美国所给予希腊“经济财政援助”的观念相同，只是采用更公开与长期的形式而已。这无形中，将贝文与皮道尔所极力掩盖的“马歇尔计划”的政治目的泄露无遗。这些都证明了苏联的观点的正确，即：美国的贷款将来并不服务于欧洲的经济复兴，只是利用欧洲国家的倾轧，俾便某些强国得售其称霸欧洲的意图。由于欧洲许多国家民主力量的强大，能以在行动上保卫他们的政治经济的独立。美国资本控制欧洲的企图，纵使得到贝文与皮道尔的协助，仍已开始遭到失败。
    【新华社陕北廿一日电】罗马十九日讯：意大利报纸对“欧洲经济复兴会议”之结果，成表不满。“葛洛诺尔·席拉”报称：“英法邀请意国参加‘欧洲经济复兴会议’，是为了从意国取得某些东西，而不是给与意国什么”。“纯粹名义上的‘平等’特权，实际上成为付出多而取得少的特权”。“团结”报亦称：“从‘欧洲经济复兴会议’的各方面看来，非常明白，丝毫没有如英法所说那样重大意义，也未获具体结果。”该报指出：“大吹大擂的‘马歇尔计划’是不现实的，甚至并不是一个能作为协议基础的计划，在此种情形下，定会成为声势大而效果小。”该报并谴责意大利政府对“马歇尔计划”的盲目支持。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】各方讯：丹、瑞、挪、荷四国的舆论，大声反对马歇尔计划。丹麦议会政治委员会主席，社会民主党人费施在“民族”报著文称：“我们必须坚持我们的自由主权，并抵抗被人赶进口袋中去。”挪威“劳工新闻”宣称：北欧国家并不愿丧失其在东欧各国的市场。瑞典的阿富坦丁根报发表“欧洲经济复兴会议”瑞典代表团中某团长的谈话称：斯堪的纳维亚国家拒绝放弃他们在东欧的市场而去换取“马歇尔计划”的西欧经济“合作”。荷兰劳工党议员霍夫斯特宣称：美国干涉荷兰的经济生活，已至前所未有的程度。正象许多别的欧洲国家一样，我们已处在十分困难的情势中，被迫向美国借款，因而在经济上极度依赖美国。新历史教训了我们。借款被用成了政治压力的手段，对我国生活的自由发展便形成隐藏的威胁。人们不要忘了美国援助欧洲只有一个理由，就是害怕自己即将到来的经济危机。荷兰“德·瓦尔海”报亦称：马歇尔计划的目的，便是把西欧国家的整个政治经济生活置于美国控制下；荷兰政府的赞同这个计划，激起了进步人士的极大愤怒。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】布达佩斯讯：匈牙利“涅普沙瓦报”记者以“欧洲经济复兴会议的困难与焦虑”为题撰文称：与会各国代表之中越来越多的人相信等待本年十一月外长会议来解决欧洲经济合作的问题更为适当，在此期间则应经由适当的外交途径，准备苏联与东欧国家可能来参加协议的基本条件。该记者又指出：杜鲁门最近关于“美国不拟召开国会特别会议以讨论马歇尔计划”之声明，大大的引起了与会各国代表的幻灭感。因此，某些人就说：“那些怀疑美国是否会普遍贷款的人，有什么不对呢？”
