　　Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 20th. Regiment-level commanders of the KMT's 55th Division, captured in Yuncheng, felt relieved and invigorated after arriving at General Liu Bocheng's headquarters. They spoke candidly with reporters about the fighting in Yuncheng. Deputy Regiment Commander Zhang, who was in charge of the 222nd Regiment of the 74th Brigade stationed east of Linpu, guarding the Yellow River bank, told reporters: "With one soldier every 30 meters, how could we defend? None of the brothers had any confidence." Yu Kejun, the acting regiment commander of the 87th Regiment, was the first to lay down his arms when the People's Liberation Army (PLA) captured the south gate of Yuncheng on the 4th. His regiment had clashed with the PLA several times during the Longhai Campaign last year. He expressed great admiration for the PLA's high morale and technical prowess, the intensity of its firepower, and its rapid yet orderly movements. He said that when the PLA launched a strong attack on the south gate of Yuncheng, he immediately divided his defending troops into three groups, preparing to meet the PLA's bayonet charge in the trenches inside the wall. However, before the deployment was complete, the PLA's intense artillery fire broke open the south gate, and they poured in, much to his surprise. When the PLA rushed into his regimental command post, only three soldiers entered the house. He laid down his arms and walked out, seeing more than a dozen PLA soldiers standing neatly outside the door, not scattered at all. The trenches around were also filled with neat rows of soldiers, one next to the other, spirited and composed, without making a sound. He said: "This impressed me greatly. This is the good army I've always dreamed of. What I've been dreaming of for twenty years is just such an army." He recalled that when two battalions of his regiment were annihilated by the PLA's local forces at the Chicken and Duck Farm (north of Liangshan) on the 24th of last month, the intensity of the local forces' artillery fire was also something they had not anticipated. Comparing the Longhai Campaign last year with the Yuncheng battle this time, he said: "The PLA's morale and technology have improved even more than then. Now your local forces' firepower is stronger than the field army was then, while we (referring to the KMT army) are losing ground with each battle." According to Yu, the low morale of the KMT army was even more evident in the Yuncheng battle. Cao Fulin ordered his 29th Brigade's special service company, acting as a督战队 (supervisory unit), to supervise the battle in the south city and to fire fiercely on the retreating officers and soldiers, but this could not stop the troops from collapsing. Acting Regiment Commander Yu said sadly: "We suffered heavy casualties in the south gate this time. Most of them were killed by our own people. Not many were killed by your assault troops. We were in the middle, with you attacking from the front and our own people shooting from the back." The deputy regiment commander of the 222nd Regiment also confirmed that Zhang Qixian, the battalion commander of the third battalion of the regiment that came to reinforce the south gate, was shot and killed by the 督战队 outside the south city moat.

　　郓城被俘蒋军团长惊服我军士气旺盛
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线二十日电】郓城被俘蒋军五十五师的团级指挥官们于到达刘伯承将军总部后，皆如释重负，精神焕发，与记者侃侃而谈郓城作战经过。七十四旅二二二团原驻临濮集以东，守备黄河河沿，当时指挥该团的张副团长对记者称：“每三十公尺合一个兵，你看如何守法，弟兄们那个能有信心？八十七团代理团长余克俊在解放军四日攻克郓城南关时第一个放下武器，他的一个团去年陇海战役曾和解放军几次交锋，他对解放军士气及技术之高强、火力的猛烈和动作迅速而序列不乱，极表惊服。他说：当人民解放军发起对郓城南关强攻时，他即将守卫部队分作三批布署，准备在围墙内的壕沟里对付解放军的肉搏冲锋。但布署未定，解放军强烈的炮火就将南寨门轰开，一拥而入，大出他的意外。当人民解放军冲进他的团指挥所房子里时，仅有三个战士进入房子，他放下武器走出屋子，看到有十几个解放战士整齐的站在门外，一点也不散乱。四周的工事里也整齐的伏着战士的行列，一个挨着一个，精神抖擞，态度沉着，一点声响也没有。他说：“这使我十分佩服，这是我理想中的好队伍。二十年来我所梦想的就是这样的队伍。”他追述上月二十四日他的团两个营被解放军地方部队歼灭在鸡鸭厂（梁山以北）时，地方部队炮火之猛烈，也是他们所没有料到的。他以去年陇海战役与此次郓城战役相比较说：“解放军的士气与技术比那时更加提高了。现在你们地方部队的火器比那时野战军还强，我们那边（指蒋军）却是一仗不如一仗。据余谈：蒋军士气之低落，在此次郓城战役中更为明显。曹福林曾令其二十九旅特务连督战队在南城督战，向败退的官兵猛烈射击，但并不能阻止部队之溃退。余代团长感伤的说：“这次我们在南关伤亡很大，大部分是被自己人打死的，被你们突击部队打死的反而并不多，我们在中间，前面是你们打，后面是自己人打。”二二二团副团长并证明该团到南关增援的第三营营长张齐贤，就是被督战队打死在南城外壕内的。
