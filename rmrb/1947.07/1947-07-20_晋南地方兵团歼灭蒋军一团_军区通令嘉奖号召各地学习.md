    Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 18th: The local troops of the People's Liberation Army in southern Shanxi annihilated a well-equipped Chiang army 83rd Brigade regiment in two hours. Since the Liu-Deng army crossed south, the two regiments of the Youth Army 206th Division and the headquarters of the Reorganized 10th Division, which were trapped in Anyi and Yuncheng in southern Shanxi, hurriedly moved south to reinforce the Longhai line. On the 12th, a portion of the 248th Regiment of the 83rd Brigade returned north with their supplies. When they reached the Zhangcun Miaodi line, 20 li northwest of Pinglu, they were ambushed by our local troops. After two hours of fierce fighting, the 83rd Brigade's supply battalion, the 248th Regiment headquarters and two battalions, and two platoons of the 247th Regiment's transport company were completely annihilated. The ratio of enemy to our casualties was approximately 50 to 1, with 118 enemy soldiers killed or wounded and 1,403 captured alive, including battalion commanders and below. Seized were four mortars, ten 60mm mortars, fifty-five light and heavy machine guns, forty-eight Sten submachine guns, and many other military supplies. The leaders of the Taiyue Military Region praised it as a glorious pioneering achievement of the local troops in the area to independently annihilate the enemy.
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Jinji Luyu Military Region recently issued a circular praising the local combat troops of the Taiyue Third Military Sub-district, stating: The local troops of this unit actively and proactively attacked the enemy, were good at seizing opportunities, and on the 12th of this month, at Miaodi Village, Pinglu, decisively and thoroughly annihilated an entire regiment of the 83rd Brigade of the Chiang Army's Reorganized 10th Division, creating a new record for local troops annihilating regular enemy forces. The military region hereby issues a circular commending them and calls on all local troops in the region to learn from them.
