　　The Panic-Stricken, Starving Cities of Northern Henan
　　Tian Mujun
　　According to recent accounts from students escaping from Kaifeng and individuals arriving from Xinxiang in our liberated areas: following the great victory at Tangyin, the enemy's important troop deployment points in northern Henan, Xinxiang, Jixian, and the provincial capital Kaifeng were greatly shaken. Many people have fallen into panic, deeply fearing that our army will approach the city walls, hence the strict security, leaving them uneasy day and night. Visitors have witnessed the extremely low morale of the Kuomintang soldiers, looking dejected on guard duty, appearing easily defeated. Both the Kuomintang-controlled military and civilians are aware of the capture of Sun Dianying and Li Shouzhen, admiring our army's powerful and irresistible strength. Along the railway lines, at stations, and around towns, people are being seized in large numbers to rush the construction of defensive fortifications. Trees have been almost completely felled within a radius of dozens of miles, with intricate trenches and dense bunkers. The breakdown of military discipline in the Kuomintang army is beyond repair; chickens, sheep, pigs, and ducks inside and outside the city and in the countryside have all been eaten, and even the daughters of wealthy and prominent families have been raped. The people are filled with anger and resentment, eagerly awaiting our army's attack on the cities. Schools above the junior high level and the families of officials in Jixian and Xinxiang are fleeing south in droves, and important agencies and assets in Kaifeng are also being transferred to areas around Xuchang. Recently, a fire broke out at Xinxiang Airport, burning down the gasoline depot completely and destroying one aircraft. The authorities arrested the soldiers guarding the field and accused them of being "Communists." People dare not believe the Kuomintang newspapers anymore. On Xinxiang's Pseudo-Taoist Government Street, the Taihang edition of the New China Daily is circulating semi-openly. The authorities are unable to prohibit it.

　　Led by students from Henan University, the anti-civil war and anti-hunger movement in Kaifeng is intensifying. Several Kuomintang newspapers have openly begun to criticize the government, and journalists throughout Henan Province are launching a struggle with the judicial community. Journalists have jointly issued a declaration calling on the people of the province to accuse the judicial community of various dark crimes. Henan University students' wall posters are scolding and cursing the Kuomintang government fiercely! One article titled "The Kuomintang Government in My Eyes" thoroughly denounced Chiang Kai-shek's dark rule! An "anti-spy" movement has been launched in the school, and anyone suspected of being a spy is attacked by the crowd. On the "June 2nd" anti-civil war day, Henan University students led demonstrations and parades, drawing pictures of Chiang Kai-shek kneeling as a slave to the United States and writing slogans such as "If the thief Chiang doesn't die, the civil war won't end." Military police rushed up with guns, attempting to suppress them, but the students marched forward bravely without fear. One day, they surrounded Henan University. Under the supervision of several machine guns, the students were subjected to full-body searches, and more than a dozen so-called "suspects" were arrested. Students swarmed to the school gate, raising questions and demanding immediate release. Many educated young people and university students are trying to escape to the liberated areas to find the light.

　　The Kuomintang-controlled areas have suffered consecutive years of poor harvests, coupled with forced requisitions and purchases, leading to food shortages and families without enough grain for the next day. The Kuomintang currency is being issued recklessly, and prices are soaring; a ten-thousand-yuan bill is no longer enough for a single meal. Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Xuchang, and other places have become havens for wealthy guests, causing prices to skyrocket. Wheat flour in Luoyang has risen to 2,500 yuan per pound. In the past, "Luoyang paper was expensive," but today, "Luoyang grain is expensive."

　　恐慌饥饿的豫北城市
    田牧军
    综合近日逃来我解放区的开封学生及新乡来人谈：汤阴大捷后，豫北敌之重要屯兵点新乡汲县和省会开封大为震动。许多人已陷入恐慌中，深畏我军兵临城下因而警戒森严，朝夕不安，来人曾目睹蒋军士兵极低落之士气，站岗时神气颓丧不堪一击，蒋区军民皆知孙殿英李守正被俘，惊佩我军力量强大不可抗拒。铁道沿线车站城关周围正大批抓夫赶修防御工事。方圆数十里之树木已砍伐殆净，壕沟纵错碉堡密布。蒋军军纪之败坏已不可收拾，城里关外乡下之鸡羊猪鸭俱被吃光，豪绅望旗的名门闺秀亦遭奸污。人民怒目切齿愤不可抑，盼我军早日攻城。汲县新乡高小以上的学校以及官员眷属已纷纷南下，开封的重要机关及资财也在向许昌一带转移。新乡机场最近失火，汽油库燃烧净光，并烧毁飞机一架。当局将守场士兵逮捕，加以“共产党”的罪名。人民对蒋记报纸已不敢相信，在新乡伪道尹公署街则半公开的流传着新华日报太行版。当局无法禁止。
    开封学生在河南大学学生率领下，反内战反饥饿的运动日趋激烈，若干国民党机关报，公开开始指斥政府，全河南省记者正与司法界展开斗争，记者联名发表宣言号召全省人民向记者控诉司法界的种种黑暗罪行。河大学生的墙报大骂特骂国民政府，曾有一文题为“我眼中的国民党政府”将蒋介石的黑暗统治骂得淋漓尽致！学校中已掀起“反特务”运动，谁是特务，大家便群起而攻。“六二”反内战日，河大学生为先导游行示威。并沿途画蒋介石屈膝美国的奴才相，写“蒋贼不死内战不止”的标语。军警持枪涌上，企图镇压，学生仍勇往直前毫不畏缩。某日将河大包围。在数挺机枪的监视下，学生们个个遭受全身检查，并捕去所谓“嫌疑分子”十余名。学生蜂涌校门口，提出质问，要求当场释放。许多知识青年大学生正在设法逃入解放区寻找光明。
    蒋管区连年欠收，加上强征强购，以致民食堪忧，家无隔日之粮。蒋币滥发，物价澎涨，万元票已不能饱食一餐。郑州洛阳许昌等地已成为贵客们的避难所。以致物价飞腾上涨。洛阳白面已涨至两千五百元一斤。昔日“洛阳纸贵”，今日“洛阳粮贵”了。
