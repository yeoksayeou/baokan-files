　　Gaoyi New District, Sijiazhuang
  　Explaining and Implementing Equivalent Value for Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers
    [Reported by this newspaper] After the deployment of the large-scale production work in Sijiazhuang, Gaoyi New District, the entire village organized twenty-eight groups, which have been engaged in work exchange and mutual assistance until now. Production achievements have also been considerable. During the rush planting of cotton, each person planted an average of nearly one mu of cotton in seven or eight days. However, now many problems have arisen. Middle peasants with more labor power are complaining: "Livestock, people, and labor (surplus labor) have all become public. After using our strength, we haven't cultivated our own land well." As a result, many people's enthusiasm for production has declined. New turn-over households have muddled ideas about taking advantage and fearing that equivalent value will mean taking wages. The leadership immediately convened a symposium of activists from among the hired laborers, tenant farmers, and poor peasants. First, they encouraged everyone's production enthusiasm, and then guided them to understand through concrete accounting. They used examples of some people who worked actively despite having weak livestock labor, and did not owe labor, to dispel worries about difficulties in taking wages. As long as they worked hard, they could exchange work for labor. For the middle peasants, they implemented equivalent value. People with surplus labor dare to boldly use people, and intensive cultivation will be good. At the end of the meeting, everyone put forward the slogan: "If mutual aid collapses, the hired laborers and poor peasants will suffer greatly; if mutual aid is carried out, the middle peasants will rise the fastest." After this meeting, fourteen groups in the village have now begun to implement equivalent exchange, and they are now working very vigorously. (Du Diankui, Liu Feng)

　　高邑新区寺家庄
  　说通贫雇实行等价
    【本报讯】高邑新区寺家庄从布置大生产工作后，全村组织了二十八组，一直工换工互助到现在，生产成绩也不小，突击种棉，七、八天里每人平均种花近一亩，但到现在问题可就多了。劳力多的中农叫苦起来了：“牲口、人、劳力（余劳力）都成公的了，用了力自己地倒没种好。”不少人因此生产情绪低落。而新翻身户，则有沾了光怕等价拿工资的糊涂思想。领导上当即召开了雇佃贫积极分子座谈会，首先鼓励了大家的生产热情，然后引导用具体算帐打通思想，并拿出一些人干的积极畜劳力弱也没欠下工来打通拿工资困难，只要加油干就能工折工，对中农方面实行了等价，人家有余劳力就敢大胆用人，深耕细作就会好。会终大家提出口号：“互助垮台，雇佃贫受大害；互助起来，中农上升最快。”经过了这个会议后，现在该村已有十四组实行起等价交换，现在干的很起劲。（杜殿魁、刘枫）
