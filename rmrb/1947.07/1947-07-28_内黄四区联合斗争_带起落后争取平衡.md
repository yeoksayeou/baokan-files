　　Neihuang Fourth District Joint Struggle
  　Leading the Backward to Strive for Balance
    [This newspaper's report from Jilu豫 on the 26th] Six thousand people in the fourth district of Neihuang carried out a joint struggle. When the district discussed the solution to the imbalance in the development of work between villages and the incomplete re-examination in the Sanlian Defense Area at the Poor Peasants' Congress, it was unanimously decided to engage in joint struggle to break through the blank spots and lead the backward villages. The method was: first, the landlords from various villages were concentrated and sent to Xiyongjian Village, guarded by militiamen. In each village, mainly poor peasants, brewing was carried out to prepare opinions for complaining. Masses were then concentrated for joint struggle. Then, the peasants, cadres, women, and children of various villages, carrying grievance-and-revenge sticks and shouting slogans to eliminate the landlord class, surged to three venues near Xiyongjian Village. Each venue had about two thousand people. When the landlords and their families were escorted to the front of the stage at each venue, the masses were filled with grief and indignation, with cries of complaint, cries of sorrow, and shouts of slogans. At the Hexi Village venue, a poor peasant, Zong, said: "The landlord Shi Dahu, eight years ago, drove his cart through my field, ruining my crops. When I said something, he beat me and took me to the city to sue. They had influence, and I lost thirty silver dollars. It's really hard for the poor to swallow their anger." The masses at each venue complained one after another, becoming increasingly angry. Then, they turned to demanding debts and chasing after wealth, telling the landlords to repay their blood debts. Each venue responded to each other, arousing boundless hatred for the landlord class. In this situation, the landlords reported the wealth they had exploited from the poor. Four landlords were struggled against that day. In the joint struggle, the masses encouraged and supported each other, and the advanced villages led the backward villages. For example, He Village and Houzhai Temple had been afraid to offer opinions in the past, but after this joint struggle, they also actively struggled. Village cadres' leadership abilities were cultivated in mutual learning. District cadres, the masses, and village cadres jointly came up with solutions, promoting the work and enriching the leadership. At the same time, the class hatred of the broad masses was aroused from the complaints, giving the landlords great suppression and threats, and a large amount of floating wealth was recovered. On the third day, the fruits were rationally distributed.
    [This newspaper's report from Jilu豫 on the 25th] The masses in Xiaoshizi Village in the fourth district of Qingfeng used the method of settling the overall account to expose the landlord's "enlightened" tricks and conduct a thorough review. The landlord of this village, Liu Congxiang, was an old landlord for three or four hundred years. In order to escape struggle, he gave the masses small favors. In years of famine, he lent two shi of sorghum, while simultaneously exploiting the masses with high interest rates, in order to win over some village cadres and the masses. During the land reform, he had his second son, Lu Shan, infiltrate a factory, and his eldest son, Lu Qing, become a teacher in the village. He also "voluntarily" turned over some grain, clothing, and the like to paralyze the masses. The district praised him, and the masses were afraid to offer opinions about him. Recently, a re-examination was conducted, and the leaders expressed their support for the masses. The enthusiasm of the masses was raised. However, a few cadres said that Liu Congxiang was an "enlightened landlord" and that the district had praised him, so he could not be struggled against, and that struggling against him would have a bad influence. People close to him also said: "The landlord has already voluntarily turned over everything, there's nothing left." But most of the masses said: "Today, no one is living as well as Liu Congxiang. The voluntary surrender was all a fake show." So, they calculated his overall account: how he had lived before, how much he had been allotted during the family division, how much land he had, and how much income he had from running the oil mill. After this calculation, those who thought he was "enlightened" stopped humming and hawing. Then, Liu Congxiang was detained, and a mass meeting was convened. A yard full of things was moved out, and a pit of grain was dug up, four or five shi of wheat, and a pit of wheat that had rotted into mud. At this time, the masses saw through his tricks and interrogated him about the things. He said: "I really don't have anything left. If you find anything else, shoot me." But after investigation, his mother reported a dozen packages, forty or fifty silver dollars, and a large jar of copper coins. The masses questioned him again, and he reported six or seven packages and furniture stored in the neighbor's house. The village is still continuing the re-examination.

　　内黄四区联合斗争
  　带起落后争取平衡
    【本报冀鲁豫二十六日电】内黄四区六千群众进行联合斗争。该区在贫农大会上讨论三联防区村与村工作发展不平衡、复查不彻底的解决办法时，一致决定伙搞联合斗争，以突破空白，带领落后村。其作法是：先将各村地主集中送西永建村，由民兵看押，各村以贫农为主进行酝酿，准备诉苦意见，集中群众联合斗争。接着各村农民、干部、妇女、儿童拿着伸冤报仇棍，高喊消灭地主阶级的口号，分别涌到西永建村附近的三个会场。每一会场约两千多人。当被斗地主及其家属押解到各个会场台前时，群众满腔悲愤，一片诉苦声，哭声，喊口号声。河西村会场上贫农宗某说：“地主师大户，前八年从俺地里过车，把俺的庄稼都压坏了，我说了一句，他打了我一顿，又拉我到城里去打官司。人家有势力，咱又赔上了三十块现洋。穷人受他的气真难咽。”各会场群众纷纷诉苦，越诉越愤怒。接着转向要帐追财，叫地主还血帐。各会场互相响应，激起对地主阶级的无限仇恨。在这种情形下，地主报出了剥削穷人的财物。当天斗了四家地主。在联合斗争中，群众互相壮胆、撑腰、先进村带领了落后村。如河村、后砦寺过去几次不敢提意见，经过这次联合斗争，也积极斗争起来。并在互助学习中培养了村干部领导能力。区干群众和村干共同想办法。推动工作，丰富了领导。同时，从诉苦中激起广大群众的阶级仇恨，予地主以极大镇压与威胁，追出大批浮财。第三天合理分配了果实。
    【本报冀鲁豫二十五日电】清丰四区小十字村群众用算总帐方法，揭破地主“开明”诡计，彻底进行复查。该村地主刘从祥，是三四百年来的老地主，为逃避斗争，对群众施以小恩小惠。灾荒年，他一面放高利剥削群众，一面借出两石高粱，以拉拢部分村干及群众。土地改革中，他让二儿鲁善混入工厂，大儿鲁卿在村里当教员，又“自动”了点粮食、衣物之类，以麻痹群众。区里表扬了他，群众对他有意见也不敢提。最近重新复查，领导表示给群众撑腰。群众情绪提高。但少数干部说刘从祥是“开明地主”，区里表扬过，不能斗，斗了影响不好。和他近的人也说：“地主东西都自动啦，没啥了。”但大部分群众说：“今天谁也没有刘从祥过得好，自动全是玩假把戏。”于是给他算了算总帐：他以前过得怎样，分家批了多少东西，多少地，开油房收入多少，这一算，认为他“开明”的人不哼了。接着把刘从祥扣起来，召开群众大会，搬出一院子东西，并挖出一坑谷子，四、五石麦子，还有一坑烂成泥的麦子。这时群众看穿了他的诡计，向他追问东西。他说：“我实在没东西啦，你们再查着东西，枪毙我。”但经调查，他母亲报出十几个包袱，四、五十块银元，一大罐铜子。群众反问他，他又报出邻居家放的六、七个包袱，及家具等。现该村仍在继续复查中。
