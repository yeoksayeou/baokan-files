    Yuanshi County Government Suspends Office Work
    Cadres Go to the Countryside to Organize Emergency Planting
    [Reported by this newspaper] On the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, most areas of Yuanshi County had a thorough rain. That evening, Vice County Chief Zhang rushed back from the front line of the struggle against seizing wheat and convened a meeting of section chiefs. It was decided to suspend all work, except for the office, the civil affairs section, and the finance and food section, each of which would retain one person to continue working. All other cadres would go to the countryside to help and organize the masses to carry out emergency planting. On the morning of the 3rd, all the cadres went to the villages separately. The county government's forward supply station, in order to free up time for the masses to produce, organized the government's livestock and vehicles to the front line, so that the masses did not need to use a single animal or vehicle, freeing up time for them to plant.

    [Reported by this newspaper] Zanhang had rain on the 2nd of this month. The county cooperative has more than 20 mu of land planted by itself and prepared three mules. To help the masses with emergency planting, all cadres pulled plows, six people pulling two, freeing up two mules to help the families of soldiers to plant. (Farmers' Small Newspaper)
