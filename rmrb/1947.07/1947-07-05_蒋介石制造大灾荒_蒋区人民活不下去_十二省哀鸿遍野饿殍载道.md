Chiang Kai-shek Creates a Great Famine
People in Chiang's Area Cannot Survive
Lamentations Heard Across Twelve Provinces, Starving Corpses Line the Roads

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd] Comprehensive news from newspapers in the Chiang-controlled areas: Famine is spreading in Chiang's area. In the Chiang-occupied areas of Hebei Province, the Chiang government's unlimited exploitation has led to the tragic situation of land without farmers. Coupled with spring and summer droughts, wheat seedlings have withered, and there is no way to sow autumn crops, resulting in thousands of miles of barren land. According to official statistics from the Chiang regime: Famine victims in its occupied areas account for seven-tenths of the population. Yet, the Chiang government still levies 290,000 shi of military grain. In the vast areas of eastern and northern Hubei, due to the harshness of grain requisitioning and purchasing, and the insatiable exploitation by Chiang's local officials and despots, most households are empty in the countryside, and deaths from starvation and suicide are common. Linhe County in the Hetao area of ​​Suiyuan and several counties along the Yellow River, such as Sarachi, were originally wealthy areas of the province. However, due to heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies, such as in Goumen Village, Sarachi, where each mu produced seven or eight dou of wheat, the burden of military grain reached as high as one shi and seven or eight dou per mu; another example is the supply of lamp oil for Chiang's army, with the village providing thirty-two jin every night. In addition, the widespread conscription of young men has caused the able-bodied to scatter, and now fields are desolate and starving corpses line the roads. Furthermore, due to the Chiang government's failure to repair dams, Guangdong suffered floods in seventy counties and cities, accounting for about seven-tenths of the province's one hundred and three counties and cities. Guangxi suffered floods in fifty counties and cities, accounting for more than half of the province's ninety-nine counties and cities. Taichung and Zhuxian in Taiwan also suffered severe floods. The southwestern part of Jiangxi Province, including Suichuan and Yongxin, and the counties along the east bank of Poyang Lake; eastern and northern Anhui, western and northern Sichuan, northern Henan, southeastern Anhui, and southern Liaoning, due to Chiang's disasters and natural calamities, are all scenes of desolation, and people are already eating grass roots and tree bark.
　　
 　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st] According to a Central News Agency report: Floods in provinces such as Guizhou, Guangdong, and Taiwan have become more severe in recent days. In southwestern Guizhou, the water depth in flat areas has reached two zhang, with disaster victims everywhere. In Guangdong, the number of flood victims in counties along the river has reached more than five million, with about six thousand deaths and missing persons, and more than seven million five hundred thousand mu of cultivated land affected. The unprecedented flood in Taichung, Taiwan Province, is estimated to have caused losses of more than 3 billion New Taiwan Dollars (the exchange rate between New Taiwan Dollars and Chiang's currency is one to forty-three). Currently, there are more than sixty breaches and potential breaches in the revetment堤岸, totaling more than ten thousand meters in length, and the disaster area is expected to continue to expand. In response to this severe flood, the Chiang Kai-shek government has not only failed to take appropriate measures but has instead announced on the 28th the implementation of "purchasing" grain along with taxes in Taiwan, further increasing the burden on the people in the disaster areas.

　　蒋介石制造大灾荒
  　蒋区人民活不下去
  　十二省哀鸿遍野饿殍载道
    【新华社陕北二日电】综合蒋区报纸消息：蒋区灾荒蔓延。冀省蒋占区由于蒋政府之无限榨取，造成有地无人耕的惨象，加以春夏天旱，麦苗枯死，秋禾无由下种，现已赤地千里。据蒋记官方统计：其占领区内饥民已占十分之七。而蒋政府仍将勒索军粮二十九万石。鄂东、鄂北广大地区，因征粮征购之苛扰及蒋记地方官吏与土劣之无餍剥削，乡间已十室九空，饿毙与自杀者比比皆是。绥远河套的临河县及沿黄河的萨拉齐等若干县份，原为该省富庶之区，因苛杂繁重，如萨拉齐之沟门村每亩产麦七、八斗，而负担军粮每亩竟达一石七、八；另如负担蒋军灯油，该村每夜供给到三十二斤。加以到处抓丁，青壮四散，现已田园荒无，饿殍载道。再由于蒋政府之不修堤坝，致广东水灾达七十县市，约占全省一百零三县市的十分之七。广西水灾五十县市，占全省九十九县市的大半。台湾之台中、竹县等地亦遭严重水灾，赣省西南遂川、永新一带及鄱阳湖东岸各县；皖东、皖北、川西、川北、豫北、安徽东南部、辽宁南部，由于蒋祸及天灾，均哀鸿遍野，人民已以草根、树皮为食。
    【新华社陕北一日电】据中央社讯：桂粤台等省水灾连日更形严重。桂西南平地水深已达两丈，灾民遍野。广东沿江各县灾民已达五百万以上，死亡失踪者约有六千人，受灾耕地达七百五十余万亩。台省台中之空前水灾，估计损失约在台币三十余亿元（台币与蒋币比值为一比四十三元）以上，现护岸堤决口及将溃者共有六十余处，长达万余公尺，灾区势将继续扩大。对此深重水灾，蒋介石政府不但未谋妥善措施，反而于二十八日发表在台湾实行随赋“购”粮，加重灾区人民之负担。
