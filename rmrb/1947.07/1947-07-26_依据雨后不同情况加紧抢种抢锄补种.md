　　Intensify Resowing and Weeding After the Rain Based on Different Situations
　　Yangcheng, Xingtai Rush to Sow 60,000 Mu

　　[Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 24th Dispatch] Yangcheng experienced three consecutive rainfalls on the 10th, 11th, and 12th of this month. Except for individual districts, the entire county received three or four finger-widths of rain, and the seventh district was thoroughly soaked. Under the county's call to "Rush to Sow Quickly," cadres at all levels promptly went deep into the villages to lead the masses in rushing to sow. In the first district alone, 30,632 mu were sown on the 15th and 16th, accounting for 95% of the district's land. During the rush to sow, men and women, young and old, worked as if on the front line. All 38 mutual aid teams, with over 800 able-bodied and semi-able-bodied people, and 40 head of livestock, engaged in an intense effort, resowing over 1,100 mu in three days. Furthermore, Ma Linzhong, a military dependent in Chengxiguan, mobilized his entire family to work in the fields, and his 13-year-old daughter also helped. In Xijiao, Sixth District, as soon as the heavy rain stopped, the villagers immediately drove cattle, carried seeders, and put seeds on their backs, returning to the fields, replanting 205 mu in less than half a day.
　　[Our Newspaper, Xingtai News] On the evening of the 12th of this month, it rained in Xingtai. Although not very thorough, it was widespread. Based on the masses' fear of sowing without germination after the last rain, the county government personnel organized a shock sowing team to go to the countryside to help the masses sow. Except for a few comrades who could not leave their work at home, a total of 19 people were selected and assigned to the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth districts. Before leaving, County Head Wu told the comrades: "This time, strive for universal sowing, preferring to sacrifice seeds rather than land. Perform meritorious service for the people in shock sowing." The comrades didn't even wash their faces or eat their meals, and went down early. They organized the masses in the villages, temporarily drawing labor to fully sow. When weeding seedlings, they also worked. The military dependents were given priority in planting. In two days, 15 comrades did a shock sowing in 25 villages, totaling 30,052 mu. At the commendation meeting, the comrades who went to the countryside were commended and praised in the county's small newspaper. (Chang Yan)

　　Huguan Third District Suffers Hail Disaster, Resowing 700 Mu in Two Days

　　[Our Newspaper, Huguan News] More than ten villages, including Gucun and Shaoliang in the Third District, suffered a severe hail disaster on July 15th. According to statistics, 10,000 mu of land had no harvest at all. At that time, the Third District Party Branch quickly organized cadres to go to the countryside to comfort the masses and called on the entire district to mobilize urgently and strive to resow to survive the famine. Our democratic government and the county and district cooperatives quickly sent people to purchase late-season seeds (barley, buckwheat, etc.). The Gucun distillery took out more than 40 stone of barley and distributed it to various villages. Each village established a resowing and famine relief committee. Party members in Gucun took the lead in promoting the masses in the entire village. 200 mu were resown in two days. At the beginning, the masses in Beida'an were pessimistic and disappointed, saying: "It's no use! Half a year's effort has been wasted!" Wu Long, director of the district armed forces, proposed: "Will pessimism work? Is it better to resow early or to delay?" After discussion, everyone said: "We should take the initiative." Some said: "In 1943, there were Japanese, stubborn elements, and famine, and we still got through it. Now that there is more land, more people, and a great victory, we are even less afraid. As long as we work hard, people will surely conquer nature." The resowing mood in each village is extremely high: Fan Xiangyun, a textile hero in Gucun, led seven women in the entire village group to the land before dawn to resow. According to statistics from sixteen and seventeen, five villages have replanted more than 770 mu. The slogans raised by everyone are: "Mobilize urgently, rush to plant to save on food, save one seedling is one seedling, grab one piece is one piece," now the masses in each village are actively resowing.

　　Wucheng Intensifies Organization of Rush Weeding After Cloudy and Rainy Weather

　　[Our Newspaper, Southern Hebei 24th Dispatch] After days of cloudy and rainy weather in Wucheng, weeds grew wildly everywhere. Mutual aid teams throughout the county were mobilized to rush to weed. Since the beginning of summer, the county has lacked rainfall, and due to mole cricket damage, early seedlings are scarce. Most crops were replanted and sown manually under the call to prevent drought and prepare for famine, mostly sweet potatoes, peanuts, late millet, corn, etc. Therefore, the masses have placed all their hopes on the late seedlings. If they do not rush to weed, and if it continues to rain, the land will be wet and unable to be hoed, the weeds will be lush and the seedlings will be yellow, and all previous efforts will be wasted. Cadres and men and women mutual aid teams in various villages accepted the experience of rushing to plant to overcome drought and were confident in rushing to weed. Maodian Village took advantage of the opportunity when the land was wet and could not be entered to rush to make wheat season burdens, preparing to carry out a surprise weeding as soon as the ground was slightly dry. Mutual aid groups launched challenges, and men and women shouted together that they would make contributions in weeding seedlings.

　　[Our Newspaper, Southern Hebei 24th Dispatch] Women's Mutual Aid Weeds Seedlings, Saving Male Labor to Participate in War Support. Women in Dongguan Village, Third District, Qinghe, in order to save male labor to participate in stretcher transportation and other work. Feng Liansheng, director of the women's association, led 25 young and middle-aged women to participate in agricultural production and formed four women's production mutual aid groups. At first, many women said, "Working in the fields to weed seedlings is not something our women do." After trying it out in the fields, they all felt, "It's not work that women can't do." Especially Li Changlian and 17 others, in addition to weeding the first and second times, also plowed two and a half mu of wasteland, and the corn, cowpeas, and melons planted grew very well. Their mutual aid work calculation is three work points per day, calculated as three half-days. The mornings are cool, the work is short, and they still do a lot of work. They have to go down early in the morning and come back to cook in the afternoon, and then do some odd jobs after washing the pots. This way, the three half-days are averaged. The work points are assessed based on how much work each person does in a half-day or day, and the amount of labor they put in. First, the person is asked to give their opinion, then everyone assesses the number of work points, and finally, the standard wage is calculated with the person's consent. The women chatted and laughed while they worked, and they felt very interested, saying: "We women can't be soldiers and carry stretchers, so if we don't learn to do field work, who will go to the front line?!"

　　依据雨后不同情况加紧抢种抢锄补种
  　阳城、邢台抢种六万亩
    【本报太岳二十四日电】阳城于本月十日、十一日、十二日连雨三次，全县除个别区外，均普遍落雨三、四指，七区并已下透。各区干部在县的“赶快抢种”号召下，及时深入各村领导群众抢种。仅一区十五、十六两天抢种了三万○六百三十二亩，占全区土地百分之九十五。抢种时，男女老幼如同上火线，三十八个互助组全部男女全半劳力八百余人，牲口四十头，紧张突击，三天内补种一千一百余亩。又城西关军属马林忠，动员全家下地，十三岁的小闺女也上地帮活。六区西交大雨刚停，全村群众即赶牛扛耧背籽上了地，不到一晌即回茬了二○五亩。
    【本报邢台讯】本月十二日晚，邢台下了雨，虽不很透但很普遍，根据上次雨后群众怕种了不出怕舍种思想，县府机关人员组织了个突击下种队下乡帮助群众下种，除留下少数有工作脱不开手的同志在家外，共抽出十九人分到三、四、五、六、区。临行吴县长给同志们说：“这次下去争取普遍下种，能舍种不舍垧，在突击下种上为民立功”。同志们脸也不洗饭也没吃，一早就下去了。到村组织群众，临时抽调劳力全面下种，锄苗时还工，先给军属种，二天时间，十五个同志突击了二十五个村，共下种三万零五十二亩，在评功会上，给下乡的同志评了功，在县小报上表扬。（昌言）
    壶关三区遭雹灾两天补种七百亩
    【本报壶关讯】三区固村、绍良等十余村于七月十五日遭受严重雹灾，据统计有万亩土地全无收成。当时三区党的分委会迅速组织干部下乡，安慰群众，并号召全区紧急动员起来，努力抢种渡荒。我民主政府及县区联社。迅速派人到各处购买晚种，（大麦荞麦等）固村酒坊取出大麦四十余石分到各村。各村成立了抢种渡荒委员会，固村党员带头推动全村群众，两天抢种二百余亩。北大安开始群众悲观失望说：“不行啦！受了半年搭功啦！”区武主任伍龙同志提出：悲观行不行！早点抢种好？还是拖好？讨论后大家说：“应该是先下手为强。”有的说：“四三年有日本、有顽固、又有灾荒还要渡过来哩，现在地大人多又有大胜利就更不怕，只要努力干，人定能胜天”。各村抢种情绪极高：固村纺织英雄范相云，天不明就领导全村小组七个妇女上地补种。据十六、十七两天五个村统计：已补种七百七十多亩，大家提的口号是：紧急动员起来，抢种节约渡荒，救活一苗算一苗，抢种一块是一块，现各村群众正积极抢种补种中。（如龙）
    武城阴雨过后加紧组织抢锄
    【本报冀南廿四日电】武城连日阴雨，遍地野草狂长，全县互助一齐出动，突击抢锄。该县入夏以来雨量不足，又因蝼蛄损害，早苗缺少，大部庄稼都是在防旱备荒的号召下，用人力补种和点种起来的，多是红薯、花生、晚谷、棒子等，所以群众一切寄托都放在晚苗身上，如不抓紧抢锄，再连接下雨，地湿不能动锄，草旺苗黄，前功尽弃。各村干部男女互助组接受了抢种战胜旱灾的经验，都信心十足的突击抢锄。毛店村趁地湿不能进人的机会，赶造出麦季负担，准备地稍干即进行突击锄草。各互助组掀起挑战，男女一齐喊出要在锄苗中立功。
    【本报冀南二十四日电】妇女互助锄苗，省出男工参加战勤。清河三区东关村妇女为省出男子劳力参加担架运输等工作。妇会主任冯莲生带领二十五名青壮年妇女，参加了农业生产，组成四个妇女生产互助组，起初很多妇女都说：“下地锄苗不是咱娘们干的活。”经下地试锄后，都感觉“不是妇女干不了的活。”尤其是李长莲等十七名，除锄完头二遍地，还拉犁开了二亩半荒地，种上的棒子、豆角、瓜都长的很好。她们的互助计工，一天按三晌算三个工。早晨凉快，工夫短也不少做活。上午得早下晌，回来做饭，下午刷了锅，再做点零星活，去的晚点。这样三晌就平均了。评工按每个人一晌或一天做活多少，出劳力大小，先叫本人提出意见，再经大家评定工数，最后经本人同意即算标准工资。妇女一边做活，一边说说笑笑，她们感到非常有兴趣，说：“咱娘们又不能当兵抬担架，再不学会做地里活叫谁去上前线呢？！”
