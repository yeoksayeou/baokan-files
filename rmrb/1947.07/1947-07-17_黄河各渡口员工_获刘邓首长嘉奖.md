Generals Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping have sent a letter of commendation and慰劳. The letter has been mimeographed and distributed. The original text is as follows: "Because you disregarded the enemy's artillery fire and Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft harassment, disregarding the fatigue of day and night, actively assisted our army in crossing the first major obstacle of the great counter-offensive, and completed the historically significant river crossing mission, enabling our army to reach the south bank of the Yellow River very smoothly to annihilate the Chiang's puppet troops, recover lost territory, and liberate our compatriots. This is a great contribution you have made to the independence of the motherland and the liberation of the people. All commanders and fighters admire and are grateful for your unparalleled enthusiasm and initiative. After we arrived on the south bank, we successively recovered Juancheng, Juye, Cao County, Yuncheng and other places, and eliminated two brigades of Chiang's army Cao Fulin's unit. These victories are inseparable from you. To慰劳your hard work, we specially犒劳each of you with one jin of pork, and wish you continued efforts and good health!"
