Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 24th. (Delayed) The Northwest Democratic Allied Army held a rally on the 5th in a certain area of Taihang to welcome their old superior, General Zhao Shoushan. Kong Congzhou, commander of the 38th Army, delivered a welcoming speech, recounting General Zhao's meritorious service in reforming the troops and resisting Japan, and how he was repeatedly envied and persecuted by the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, leading to his transfer from the army. He declared with indignation, "Eleven years ago, General Zhao participated in the Xi'an Incident to oppose the civil war. Now, he has come to the liberated areas to oppose the civil war and fight alongside us. But in the future, if we catch this bastard Chiang Kai-shek again, we will never let him go!" General Zhao Shoushan then rose to speak amidst thunderous applause. He emphasized that his coming to the liberated area this time was in response to Chairman Mao's call, and that every patriotic soldier should stand on the side of the people and fight the traitor Chiang Kai-shek to the end! He said that the nature of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army is the same as that of the Eighth Route Army, which is also to serve the people. Everyone must support land reform and help the peasants to turn themselves over. Finally, he sincerely hoped that everyone would intensify their study of Mao Zedong Thought, improve their skills, and accelerate the victory of the counter-offensive!

　　西北民主联军集会
  　欢迎赵寿山将军
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫二十四日电】（迟到）西北民主联军五日于太行某地集会，欢迎老长官赵寿山将军。卅八军军长孔从周致欢迎词，历述赵将军改造部队抗战有功，迭遭蒋贼嫉视迫害，调离该军之经过。并愤慨宣称：“十一年前，赵将军为反对内战参与西安事变，现在又为反内战到解放区来和我们一同战斗，但是将来再捉住蒋介石这混蛋，决不再放走他”。赵寿山将军随即在雷鸣掌声中起立讲演。他着重指出，此次来解放区系响应毛主席号召，每个爱国军人均应站到人民立场上来，和卖国贼蒋介石干到底！他说西北民主联军的性质和八路军是一样的，也是为人民服务，大家必须拥护土地改革，协助农民翻身，最后，并以恳切语气，希望大家加紧学习毛主席思想，练好本事，加速反攻胜利！
