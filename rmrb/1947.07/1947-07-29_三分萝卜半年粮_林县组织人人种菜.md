　　Three Fen of Radishes, Half a Year's Food
  　Lin County Organizes Everyone to Grow Vegetables
    [Report from our Lin County office] The 420,000 people of Lin County have urgently mobilized to dig canals, sink wells, and plant seeds, launching a "three fen of vegetable garden per person" campaign to resolutely fight the drought. The Fifth District had not seen rain for a long time, so taking advantage of the rising river water, all district cadres led the masses day and night to dig two canals, planting over 500 mu, winning the support of the masses. The two pilot villages of Xiyu and Xiancheng in the First District are seizing the opportunity to urgently sink wells and dig canals for planting. Beiguan Village alone dug twenty wells, irrigating over 400 mu of land. Nanlingyang opened a canal irrigating over 300 mu of land, and another ten-li canal was built from the Taoyuanli Gully in the West Mountain, solving the drinking water problem for more than ten villages. In addition, the Liujiajie Shangzhuang pilot took advantage of the rising river water to organize mutual aid teams to rush to carry water and plant over five qing of pumpkins, sweet potatoes, and grain. Wafangzhuang and Sangyuan combined drought resistance with famine preparedness, carrying out anti-sabotage struggles, boosting the masses' morale in fighting the drought. The Tenth District began a comprehensive emergency planting campaign in all 40-plus villages in the district starting in July, proposing a combination of planting and seedling protection. In areas like Shenjiabo, Yanjiaokou, and Liutan, 80% of planting has been completed, and over 80 mutual aid teams have been organized during the planting process. In the Second District, most villages had already dug kilns and planted corn after a half-hearted rain the previous month. To solve the difficulties of drinking water and planting, two canals were built, and Xiaotun Village alone planted over 500 mu of corn. Due to the continued development of the drought, a large area still hasn't been sown, and in some districts and villages, although some planting was rushed, the seedlings are not growing fully. Therefore, the county leadership has specifically called on all the masses to plant three fen of vegetables per person, launching the "three fen of vegetable garden" campaign. It also calls for the universal restoration of charitable granaries. The past charitable granaries in various villages should be immediately reorganized, and grain from struggles and savings in the villages can be stored in the charitable granaries, restoring the previous charitable granary management committee to prepare for relief in the most serious times. The First District has already put forward the slogan "Three Fen of Radishes, Half a Year's Food" in response to this call. Three fen of well-grown radishes can yield 600 jin, which can be exchanged for 70 jin of rice. Various villages have now launched competitions, preparing to plant seeds even without rain and aiming to complete the task in five days. (Lin County Office)
    [Report from our Yongnian office] Yongnian is implementing mutual aid and exchange of labor, with villages irrigating and hoeing seedlings day and night. In the Fangtougu sub-district of the Fourth District, production headquarters have been established in various villages. Village cadres lead mutual aid teams, using manpower and animal power in a unified manner, all calculated by work points. They gather in the morning with scythes, with men, women, old, and young all busy. In the evening, each team reports back to the production headquarters, promptly commending models to promote production. Fangtougu Village organized 27 teams with 284 men and women. While irrigating, they are also sowing seeds, completing 1,328 mu in eight days. Zhang Fa, an activist, is the leader of the 11th team. He leads well, prioritizing watering for the elderly and weak. Ji Jiang's mother, an old lady in her sixties, also participates in production, delivering meals. Old man Hou Jicun, who is 63 years old, gets up early to work, saying, "The Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army are truly the saviors of the people, leading us in production. Even if it doesn't rain, I have to make the seedlings grow and produce grain in my field!" The village chief of Dongyaozhang Village in the Fifth District, Gai Chengsen, leads all the men, women, old, and young in the village to the fields. 25 qing of land has been planted and hoed twice, and the seedlings are growing very well. In Beichen Village, over 2,200 mu have been planted with seedlings, and every family in the village participates in mutual aid. (Xiao Shan)
