　　The Hatred and Aspirations of the People on the South Bank of the Yellow River
    Cun Tian Mingsan
    After the People's Liberation Army crossed the river on a large scale and penetrated deep into southwestern Shandong, the elders and brothers on the south bank of the Yellow River, who saw the light of day again, welcomed the long-separated liberators with tears in their eyes. They complained to us about the bloody debts of hatred created by the Chiang Kai-shek army and the "Homecoming Corps" against the people on the south bank of the Yellow River, and recounted their longing for the People's Army. The Chiang Kai-shek army and the "Homecoming Corps" entrenched in Yun(cheng), Juan(cheng), and Ju(ye) before being annihilated said to the peasants: "Your minds have all been 'banditized.'" They exhausted all kinds of cruel torture such as "inverted planting," "fire roasting," "knife," "gun picking," and "dismemberment by five horses." The Chiang Kai-shek army stationed in Juancheng decided on a plan for a large-scale massacre, intending to eliminate all family members of resistance fighters in the county within a week. More than a thousand people were killed and buried alive in just three days. But at this moment, General Liu Bocheng's army, which the people had been eagerly awaiting, crossed the Yellow River and rescued everyone. Before the annihilation of the Chiang Kai-shek army in Yuncheng, a "collective sleeping system for men" was implemented in the city and strongholds, while Chiang Kai-shek's officers and soldiers wantonly raped women. When the Chiang Kai-shek army in Juye set out to loot grain, they gang-raped a twelve-year-old girl in Changguandun in the fields. In every village that the Chiang Kai-shek army had visited, there were women who were gang-raped to death or unable to get out of bed. The Chiang Kai-shek army's exploitation of the peasants on the south bank of the Yellow River required everything in silver dollars. The Chiang Kai-shek county government in Juye "collected" vegetable grain and cloth during the wheat harvest season, and also required 4.5 silver dollars per mu of land (each silver dollar was equivalent to 20,000 Chiang Kai-shek banknotes), and one gun for every 40 mu of land, which was converted into 120 silver dollars. In Yuncheng, the land tax was even more strongly "collected" at 7 jiao of silver per mu, and various apportionments averaged 7 silver dollars per mu in the whole county. Because all payments were made in silver dollars and not Chiang Kai-shek banknotes, peasants had to buy silver dollars from the Chiang Kai-shek army and its district departments and village chiefs or landlords. The Chiang Kai-shek military officers and "Returning Home Landlords" took the opportunity to exploit and made a fortune in silver dollars. The Chiang Kai-shek army feared the guerrilla warfare of the people's armed forces and forced the people to remove all the sorghum within 20 li around the strongholds and 5 li on both sides of the highway. Sorghum accounts for 70% of the main food crop for farmers in southwestern Shandong. The peasants, with tears in their eyes under the bayonet, cut down the lush green sorghum that had grown to four feet tall. An old lady in Juxi turned her head to the north every time she cut down a stalk. When asked, "What are you looking at?" she replied, "Seeing if the Eighth Route Army has crossed the river yet?" The people on the south bank of the Yellow River, who were brutally murdered by the Chiang Kai-shek army, were always looking forward to General Liu's army to liberate them before the army crossed the river. After the son of an old man named Wang Nan in Juxi was captured by the Chiang Kai-shek army, the old man was slow to take the money to redeem him. He said, "Delay those sons of bitches for two days, our troops are coming over soon." The villagers of Taipingji in Yunju (newly established county between Yuncheng and Juye) saw the counter-attacking People's Liberation Army and said: "We heard a long time ago that our troops would be here in seven days. When seven days came and we still hadn't seen them, we were worried that the white flour stretchers we had prepared would be snatched away by the 'Homecoming Corps.' You finally came. After you went to the north, our village continued to carry out the work as usual. Look at this fortification, we rely on it to hold on, we look forward to you coming over all day long, and finally we have waited."

　　黄河南岸人民的仇恨和渴望
    村田　铭三
    当人民解放军大举南渡深入鲁西南后，我黄河南岸重见天日的父老兄弟，都含着泪，热情地欢迎久别了的解放者。并纷纷向我们控诉蒋军及“还乡团”给黄河南岸人民所造下的血海深仇和诉述他们对人民军队的渴望。被歼前盘踞郓（城）鄄（城）钜（野）的蒋军和“还乡团”对农民说：“你们的脑筋全部‘匪化’了。”用尽了“倒栽葱”、“火烤”、“刀”、“枪挑”、“五马分尸”等各种酷刑。驻在鄄城的蒋军决定了一个大屠杀的计划，要在一星期内消灭全县抗属，只三天内即杀害活埋了一千多人。但正在此时，人民所望穿了眼的刘伯承将军大军渡过黄河，救出了大家。郓城蒋军被歼之前，在城内和据点里实行“男人集体睡觉制”，而蒋军官兵则放肆的奸淫妇女。钜野蒋军出发抢粮时，曾在野地里轮奸了长官屯十二岁的女孩子。凡蒋军到过的村庄，都有被轮奸至死或不能起床的女人。黄河南岸蒋军对农民的剥夺，一切都要现洋，钜野蒋记县政府在麦收季除“征收”菜粮布匹外，每亩地还要四角五分现洋（每元现洋合蒋钞两万元），每四十亩地要一支枪，折价现洋一百二十元。郓城每亩丁银更强“征”银元七角，各种摊派全县平均每亩合现洋七元。因为一律交纳现洋，不收蒋钞，农民们只有到蒋军和其区部及乡长或地主手里去买银元，蒋军将官“还乡地主”乃乘机盘剥，均大发现洋财。蒋军惧怕人民武装的游击战，强迫人民把据点周围廿里及公路两旁五里以内的高粱悉数铲除。高粱为鲁西南农民占全年收获百分之七十的主要粮食，农民在刺刀下含着眼泪把已经长成四尺高绿油油的高粱削倒。钜西的一位老太太每削倒一棵，便扭回头向北看看。旁人问她：“看啥？”她回答说：“看看八路军过河了没有？”惨遭蒋军虐杀的黄河南岸人民，在大军过河以前，时刻盼望着刘将军的大军来解放他们，钜西王楠一位老汉的儿子被蒋军抓去后，老汉迟迟不拿钱去赎。说：“拖狗日的两天吧，咱们的队伍快过河了。”郓钜（郓城、钜野之间新设县）太平集的村民，见到了反攻的人民解放军，说：“俺早就听说咱们的队伍再有七天就过来了，到七天头上还没有见来，俺们直耽心着准备下的白面担架给‘还乡团’知道抢去了，到底你们来了。你们到北边去了以后，俺们村里还是照旧的办工作，看这工事咱们就依靠这坚持着，整天盼着你们过来，到底盼着了。”
