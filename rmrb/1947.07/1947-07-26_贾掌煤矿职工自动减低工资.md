　　Jia Zhang Coal Mine Workers Voluntarily Reduce Wages
    [This Newspaper reports] The Jia Zhang Coal Mine held a general meeting of all employees on July 12th. Deputy Manager Wang proposed streamlining and economizing to prepare for famine, vigorously support the counter-offensive, reduce the seasonality of coal production, and called on everyone to solve difficulties together. After the meeting, workers in two shifts underground voluntarily reduced their wages by half a liter of rice and half a jin of white flour per person per day. Bonuses for extra work done each day and progressive wages for surplus production were turned over to the public. All cadres saved four ounces of flour per day, for a total monthly saving of eleven dan of millet and 1,200 jin of white flour. The original underground production plan was to produce 1,200 large baskets of coal from June 1st to "August 1st," but it has now been exceeded by 100%. In addition, a new savings plan was drawn up, saving an equivalent of about 320,900 yuan per month in the use of camel baskets, winding ropes, iron shovels, and other tools. Workers Liu Jinghan and Li Jingdian voluntarily reduced their wages by one dou and two dou of rice respectively. Apprentices Zhang Hongbin and Wang Kangyong reduced their wages by five sheng of millet each, for a total of one shi and five dou of millet. The industrial affairs, business, accounting, and other departments have all formulated savings plans, saving a total of more than 520,000 yuan per day, for a total saving of more than 1,560,000 yuan in three months. All employees, both above and below ground, are striving for "economy, economy, and more economy!" "Work harder and harder!" Striving to see who has made the most contributions during the "August 1st" merit evaluation. (Jia Zhang Coal Mine Correspondent Group)
