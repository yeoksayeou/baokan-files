　　Increase Production Through Thrift
  　Restaurant Workers Switch to Farming
  　Haozhang Masses Cancel Temple Fair
    [From our newspaper in Southern Hebei, 24th] Staff at the Limin Restaurant, run by the Quzhuang Cooperative in the Second District of Longping, responded to the call from higher authorities to contribute to production and thrift and voluntarily changed occupations, throwing themselves into agriculture and other productive activities. The manager, Qiao Jinzhi, is now engaged in selling small quantities of salt, while the head chef Lao Heng, the pancake maker Lao Jun, and the accountant Wensheng have all returned home to farm. They said, "Producing one more grain of food means supporting one more counter-offensive soldier, and defeating the bandit Chiang sooner."
    [Another dispatch] The masses in Dong Haozhang, Third District of Zhentang County, are practicing thrift and have decided to cancel the annual May Temple Fair. This fair used to involve three days of eating and drinking for daughters and nephews, consuming 110 shi of wheat each time. The masses said: saving some things to send to the counter-offensive army, to defeat Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible.
