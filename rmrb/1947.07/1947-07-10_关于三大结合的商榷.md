　　Deliberations on the Integration of Three Major Aspects
　　Research by the Ping Shun Joint Office, Written by Lin Hua
　　A. The Development of the Integration of Three Major Aspects:
　　The formation of the integration of three major aspects has gone through a certain path and certain conditions. What are these conditions? Namely:
　　1. After the land reform, farmers laid the foundation for getting rich. After the land reform, farmers' desire to get rich was urgent. In order to achieve the goal of getting rich, they must engage in various aspects of production to increase income. However, due to the limited individual production capacity, it is necessary to: 2. Further extensive organization. Ping Shun has a three-year history of mutual aid production, and mutual aid has become a habit. However, after farmers obtained land, their enthusiasm for production and getting rich increased, and they felt the urgent need for extensive organization. Because if they are not organized, farmers will not be able to create surplus labor and expand production. 3. In the context of the patriotic self-defense war, all production work must consider the issue of participation in the war. Due to the busy war service, there is a shortage of labor. However, it is still necessary to do a good job in various productions. Without integration, it would be impossible to do it. Therefore, the objective conditions for the formation of the integration of three major aspects were formed. 4. The natural conditions of thick stone, thin soil, and a large population determine that in order to generally achieve the goal of cultivating three and saving one, it is necessary to implement the integration of agriculture and sideline occupations throughout the year. The busy war service and the lack of labor are the current realities. To solve this problem, these three aspects must be organically organized. This is one of the objective conditions that promote the development of the integration of three major aspects. In addition, it is impossible to fight drought without extensive organization. 5. Although the "Hundred Days of Textile Movement" prevented female labor from participating in agricultural production, it greatly developed the textile industry.
　　B. The Integration Form of the Integration of Three Major Aspects:
　　The above conditions and development require the integration of agriculture, sideline occupations, and war service. However, due to different work foundations, the integration forms are also different. There are roughly the following types:
　　1. The integration of agriculture, sideline occupations, war service, and textiles. This is the integration form in villages with a foundation in mutual aid, such as Yang Jingdi, Qingcao Ao, and Chuan Di. This integration is related to both labor and capital, and has the foundation of a small cooperative. Agriculture and sideline occupations are integrated in the form of a small cooperative, and the war service labor can receive dividends in the cooperative (including both capital and labor). The amount of labor that the worker should bear is the amount that he should bear. Therefore, the integration with cooperation (including capital and labor) is the most complete and advanced. 2. The integration of war service with agriculture and general sideline occupations. This integration can only be achieved in villages with a foundation in mutual aid. War service is integrated with agriculture and general sideline occupations (both capital and labor), and the work is counted and converted into work points for profit sharing in a unified manner, but not integrated with textiles. It is integrated through wage conversion. 3. The combination of agriculture and sideline occupations and the exchange of labor for war service. This form is the most common. On the basis of several years of organized production, agriculture and sideline occupations are integrated. However, due to the departure of war service personnel, the issue of taking care of the land of war service personnel has arisen, so the relationship of labor exchange has been created. Apart from labor exchange, there is no other relationship. The formation of this integration of agriculture and sideline occupations and the labor exchange for war service is low-level and incomplete.
　　C. The Issue of Unified Leadership in the Integration of Three Major Aspects:
　　1. Unified Leadership: In today's great production movement, due to the busy war service, coupled with post work and temporary tasks, there are many things in the village. Without unified leadership, the work will fall into chaos. Therefore, unified leadership is extremely important. This unified leadership is sometimes based on the mutual aid society as the highest leadership group, such as Chuan Di and Qingcao Ao, and sometimes based on the production leadership committee as the highest group. Regardless of the form of unified leadership, it is a one-yuan leadership. Under the premise of serving production work, post work is completed through or in conjunction with production work, so that life can be properly arranged and the steps can be coordinated. After the establishment of the unified organization, it is divided into several sections, such as the agricultural section, the sideline occupation section, and the war service section. Each section has its own work content and object. Moreover, each section must be combined with a clear division of labor between administrative and cadres. For example, the war service section can absorb the logistics director, and the agricultural section can absorb labor heroes, etc., so as to complete post work in serving production work. 2. Establishment of a work system: In order to better grasp the overall situation of the village and solve problems, it is necessary to establish some necessary work systems. Without a work system, the work will not be sound. Therefore, the organization is not a formality. Attention should be paid to the fact that the system should not be too complicated. Generally, a sound meeting system can be used to understand the situation and solve problems through meetings. 3. Establish systematic work. Establishing systematic work is convenient for the intentions and decisions of the highest leadership group to be implemented among the masses. The mutual aid group is a production unit organized by the masses, so there should be a certain person in charge in the group to promote the work, but there should not be too many. Generally, there can be agricultural sideline occupation war service etc.
　　D. The Key to the Integration of Three Major Aspects:
　　The above is about the development of various aspects of the integration of the three major aspects, so what is its main content? In other words, where is the key to its integration? The following is a study on the issue of the integration of the three major aspects, which can be discussed from several aspects:
　　1. Main content and integration point. The complete integration of the three major aspects is that agriculture, sideline occupations, and war service must be unified in wages, accounting, and profit sharing. None of the three can be complete. The so-called completeness is that in the agricultural-based activities in the front and rear and agriculture and sideline occupations, general labor and surplus labor must do all the work that should be done and share the dividends that should be shared. Therefore, the integration of the three major aspects is complete.
　　To do a good job in the integration of the three major aspects, the first and most important thing is to solve the problem of unified use of labor. It is known that there are about three ways to solve this problem: One is to adopt the method of contracting work, which makes labor more concentrated and unified, and thus can generate more surplus labor. The other is to set a short-term plan for the life of the group, specifically calculate the application of work and labor, and properly arrange life, so that labor can be used in a unified manner and surplus labor can be generated. The other is to rationally use full and semi-labor and auxiliary labor to give play to the role of various labor.
　　The use and solution of surplus labor and the relationship with general labor has become the integration point. For example, if surplus labor is used for transportation, its relationship with general labor is labor exchange and profit sharing, the same as war participants, but the needs of war participants should be taken into account, so there should be some differences in the conversion of work. Another situation is to draw special personnel to engage in production—cooperatives or other. In addition to all the expenses that should be paid and the labor exchange that should be done, the profits are shared by everyone, so that general labor and surplus labor become one. This is the integration point of the integration of the three major aspects. Therefore, the main content of the integration of the three major aspects is the unified use of labor, unified wages, and unified accounting and profit sharing.
　　There are two types of unified accounting: one is to order labor to divide living expenses, and the other is to order labor to divide without folding, and the land is rated for work; but no matter which one, the needs and standards should be taken into account. For example, in the labor exchange for war service and agriculture and sideline occupations, the wage share for war service personnel is generally higher. Currently, the difference in shares in the whole county ranges from two points, four points, to six points. According to our research, two points to four points is more appropriate, and six points seems to be higher. In addition, these two methods are also two different situations from the labor exchange for war service. One is that the work points for war service are lower than the work points for agricultural work. For example, in Xia Zhuang, an animal power bears a weight of 120 jin for war service and earns ten points for a round trip of 60 li, while it earns twelve or thirteen points for agricultural work. Because the labor burden and agricultural work points are not equal, it is difficult to unify the accounting. One is that the work points for war service are equal to the work points for agricultural work, so it is easy to unify the accounting, as in An Yang Village. However, there is a problem here that has not yet been researched and resolved, that is, the requirement for the labor burden is balance, and the requirement for agricultural labor exchange is equivalence. There is a distance between the two. Therefore, how to equalize the work points for war service and agricultural work should be researched and resolved. Because the accounting result in Xia Zhuang is that the animal power takes advantage, and the accounting result in An Yang Village is that the labor takes advantage. It is still under research whether this kind of statement is inappropriate. Regarding the issue of the standard for converting work: the conversion of work in agriculture should be based on the strength of labor, and the share should be based on the weight of living expenses, which is a fixed share and flexible discount. In addition, attention should be paid to the needs of war service personnel, because war service personnel are generally full labor and work very hard outside. If you do not pay attention, you will often blur the need for care and equivalence. In textiles, the issue of the level of technology and the strength of male labor should be compared. Generally, female labor should be lower than male labor, but in terms of equivalence, in addition to taking care of technology and labor, attention should also be paid to the instability of market prices. For example, if the price of rice is low and textiles are not very profitable, then the mood of textile women is not high, so the emotional issues of both parties should also be taken care of.
　　2. How to share profits: The general profit sharing problem should take into account surplus labor and general labor, those at home and those who are out, labor and capital and specialized technology and needs, prices and production policies, which can also be said to be the principles of profit sharing.
　　But one problem must be clarified, that is, surplus labor is created by general labor. Without the organization of general labor, there would be no surplus labor. Therefore, the land gap in land reform is not too large, so it is inappropriate to overemphasize surplus labor, and both parties should be taken care of.
　　Labor-based should be divided more for outside labor, but the profit sharing of surplus work and general labor should also be taken care of. Qingcao Ao and Yang Jingdi are both "28" profit sharing, so there is more outside labor and less home labor. According to research, it is not much different to divide by 46 (labor four, group six), because surplus labor is created by general labor, and general labor still has surplus work, so in terms of labor: it is equally important. But the profit is created by outside labor, so the producer of profit should be taken care of.
　　How to share profits for surplus labor? It is generally reasonable to share profits based on work points, but attention should be paid to the issue of surplus work for outside labor. For example, Wu Falan Group in Xiao Wen Village, war service personnel should work a certain amount of long-term work, and it is not scientific to calculate based on the conversion of work. It is more reasonable to remove all the work that should be apportioned to the war service personnel and then share the profits based on the remaining work. Of course, the part that should be taken care of for the war service personnel is added to the extra work points, not the surplus work.
　　If labor is the main and capital is the auxiliary, and even capital can generate more profits, both labor and capital should be taken care of, but no matter how capital can generate profits, labor is still the main and basic, so if capital is divided too much, it is exploitation of labor. Generally, it is suitable for 28 or 37 (less capital, more labor). People with specialized technology should be given extra care, but it should not be too prominent.
　　The profit sharing problem in textiles, if it is a small textile cooperative, in addition to sharing profits according to capital, it can also be shared according to the remaining work points, so that it can be equalized. If the textile group is integrated through wages, then there is no question of profit sharing, but it can still exchange labor with agriculture. It can be seen from this that the level of wages should be determined by the value of labor and the market price.

　　关于三大结合的商榷
    平顺联合办公室研究  林华  执笔
    甲、三大结合的发展：
    三大结合的形成，是经过一定的道路和一定条件的。这些条件是什么呢？即：
    一、土地改革后农民奠定下发家基础。农民经过土地改革后，发家要求是迫切的，为了达到发家要求，就必须从事各方面的生产，来增加收入，但由于个人的单体生产力量有限，因此要：二、进一步广泛的组织起来。平顺已有三年互助生产的历史，互助已成了习惯，但在农民获得土地后，生产发家的积极性增高，更感到广泛组织起来的迫切需要。因为如果不是组织起来，农民就不可能创造出剩余劳力，就不能够扩大生产。三、爱国自卫战争情况下，一切生产工作都要考虑到参战问题。由于战勤繁忙，而造成了劳力的缺乏，但还要把各种生产搞好，如果没有结合就办不到了，所以形成了三大结合的客观条件。四、石厚土薄还得达到耕三余一。石厚土薄人口众多，这个自然条件决定了想普遍达到耕三余一，就必须是农副业结合贯彻全年，而战勤的繁忙和劳力的缺乏，又是当前的实情，想解决这一问题，必须有机的把这三方面都得组织起来。这是促进三大结合发展的客观条件之一。另外，抗旱斗争中，不是广泛的组织起来更是不行的。五、百日纺织运动虽使妇女劳力未能参加农业生产，在纺织业上却大大发展了一下。
    乙、三大结合的结合形式：
    以上条件和发展，促使农副业、战勤就必须结合，但由于工作基础不同，结合形式也不相同，大概有如下几种：
    一、农副业战勤与纺织相结合。这是在互助有基础村的结合形式，如羊井底、青草凹、川底便是。这种结合是劳力与资金都有联系，有小合作社的基础。农副业是在小型合作社的形式下相结合，而参战劳力在合作社中，能分到红利（包括资金与劳力两方面）。劳力工该负担多少则负担多少。所以说：有合作（包括资金与劳力）性的结合是最完整的高级的。二、战勤与农业及一般副业结合。这种结合，也是互助有基础的村才能做到。战勤与农业及一般副业（资劳都有）是结合的也是统一的计工变工分红，但不与纺织结合，它是通过工资的变工而结合的。三、农副业相结合与战勤的变工。这种形式最为普遍，在组织起来生产几年的基础上，农副业是结合起来了，但由于参战走了后，而照顾参战人员的土地问题，所以就产生了变工关系。除了变工外，其它就没有关系了，这种农副业结合与战勤变工的形成，是低级的不完整的。
    丙、三大结合中的统一领导问题：
    一、统一领导：今天大生产运动中，由于战勤的繁忙，再加上岗位工作及临时任务，村里事情是很多的，如果没有统一的领导，则将使工作陷于混乱。因此统一领导是万分重要的，这种统一领导，有的是互助社为最高领导集团，如川底、青草凹，有的是以生产领导委员会为最高集团。无论何种形式的统一领导，都是一元化的领导，在为生产工作服务的前提下，通过或结合生产工作完成岗位工作，这样就能使生活适当按排，步调协调。统一机构建立后，下面又分若干股，如农业股、副业股、战勤股等。各股都有它工作的内容和对象。而且各股，又必须结合行政上、干部间有明确的分工，如战勤股可吸收后勤主任参加，农业股可吸收劳英等参加，这样在为生产工作服务中来完成岗位工作。二、建立工作制度：为了更好的掌握全村情况，解决问题，建立一些必要的工作制度，是很需要的，只有机构而无工作制度，是不会使工作健全的。所以机构不是形式，应该注意到制度不要过于繁杂，一般的能健全会议制度就可以，通过会议，能了解情况解决问题。三、建立系统工作。建立系统工作是便于最高领导集团的意图和决定贯彻到群众中去，互助组是群众组织起来的生产单位，所以一般的在组内应设有一定的负责人，以便推动工作，但不宜过多，一般的有农副业战勤等即可。
    丁、三大结合的关键：
    上面所谈是关于三大结合的发展各个方面的问题，那么它的主要内容是什么呢？也就是说它结合的关键在那里，下面就是关于三大结合问题的研究，这可以分几个方面来谈：
    一、主要内容及结合点。完整的三大结合，是农副业战勤必须是统一工资算帐和分红，三者缺一都不是完整的，所谓完整是前后方及农副业在农业为主的活动下，一般劳力和剩余劳力，都要做一切应做的工，和分得应分的红利，所以三大结合是完整的。
    要把三大结合搞好，首先而且必须解决劳力统一使用问题，这个问题据目前所知道的约有三种：一种是采用包工办法，使劳力更集中和统一，因而也就能产生更多的剩余劳力。另一种是它把组里的生活订了短期计划，具体计算应用工和劳力工，适当的按排生活之后，劳力也能统一使用也能产生出剩余劳力来。还有的是合理的使用全半劳力及辅助劳力，发挥各种劳力的作用。
    对剩余劳力的使用及解决与一般劳力的关系就成了结合点，如在剩余劳力去运输了，它与一般劳力的关系是变工与分红，参战者相同，不过应照顾到参战的需要，所以在折工上应有所差异。另一种情况是抽出专人搞生产——合作社或其它的，是除了它一切应开支的开支应该变工的变工而外，利润是大家分，使一般劳力与剩余劳力成为一体，这就是三大结合的结合点，所以说，三大结合的主要内容是统一使用劳力和统一工资及统一算帐分红。
    统一算帐有这样两种：一种是劳力订分生活折，一种是劳力定分不折，土地评工；但不论是任何一种都应照顾到需要和标准。例如参战与农副业上的变工，一般的参战工资顶分要高一些，目前全县顶分的差额有二分、四分、六分不等，而据我们研究以二分至四分较为合适，六分似乎较高。另外是这两种办法与战勤的变工也是两种情况。一种是战勤工定分低于农业工定分，如下庄一个畜力在战勤上是负重一二○斤，往返六十里顶十分，而在农业工上则顶十二分或十三分，由于力役负担和农业定分不等，这样统一算帐是困难的。一种是战勤工与农业工相等，这样统一算帐就容易，如安阳村就是这样。不过这里有一个问题尚没研究解决，即力役负担的要求是平衡，而农业变工要求是等价，这中间是有距离的，因此如何使战勤工与农业工均等就应该研究解决了。因为下庄算帐的结果是畜力占了便宜，而安阳村的算帐结果劳力占了便宜，象这种提法是否欠妥尚在研究。关于折工的标准问题：农业上的折工，应按劳力强弱定分，在做生活上应按轻重生活顶分，这就是定分活折。此外应注意的地方就是应该照顾到参战的需要，因参战者一般的都是全劳力，并且在外很辛苦，如不注意，往往就把照顾需要和等价就模糊了。纺织上，技术的高低与男劳力的对比的强弱问题，一般的女劳力应该比男劳力低些，但在等价上除了照顾技术与劳力外，还应照顾到市价的不稳，如米价低纺织获利不大，则纺妇情绪不高，所以还应该照顾双方情绪问题。
    二、如何分红：一般的分红问题应该照顾到剩余劳力和一般劳力，在家的和外出者，劳力与资金及专长技术和需要，价格和生产方针，这也可说是分红原则。
    但必须明确一个问题，即剩余劳力是一般劳力创造出来的，没有一般劳力的组织起来就没有剩余劳力。因此土地改革的土地悬殊不太大了，所以过于强调剩余劳力是不妥的，应该是照顾双方。
    以劳力为主的应该是外出劳力多分些，但也应该照顾到剩余工与一般劳力的分红。青草凹、羊井底都是“二八”批红，这样外出劳力多在家劳力就少了。据研究按四、六分就不差甚，（劳四、组六），原因是剩余劳力是一般劳力所创造，而一般劳力仍有剩余工，所以在劳力上说：是同等重要的。但利润的产生是外出劳力所创造，所以对于利润的生产者应该加以照顾。
    剩余劳力如何分红？一般的按工批红是合理，不过应该注意照顾到外出劳力的剩余工问题。如孝文村吴法兰组，参战者应长工多少不等，而按折工计算是不够科学的，如果把参战者应摊的一切工除掉，再按余工批红，就比较合理了。当然对于参战者要照顾的部分，是加在多顶工上而不是加剩余工。
    以劳力为主资金为辅，甚至资金能产生更多的利润，就应该照顾劳资双方，但不管资金怎样能产生利润，而劳力还是主要的基本的，所以如果资金多分了，就是对劳力的剥削。一般的是适于二、八或三、七（资少劳多）。对有专长技术的人应额外的照顾一下，但也不能很突出。
    纺织中的分红问题，如果是纺织小型合作社，除按资批红外，也可按○余工批红，这样就能均等，如果是纺织组是通过工资去结合，这就谈不到分红了，但与农业上还是可以变工。由此可知工资的高低，应视劳力价值和市价决定。
