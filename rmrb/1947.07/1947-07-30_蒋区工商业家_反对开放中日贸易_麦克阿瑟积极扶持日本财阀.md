  　MacArthur Actively Supports Japanese Zaibatsu
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th] According to a United Press report from Nanjing: The China Industries Association, in order to oppose the opening of Sino-Japanese trade, formed a delegation on the 24th and traveled from Shanghai to Nanjing, requesting the Kuomintang authorities to halt the opening of trade with Japan. The delegation included industrialists such as Pan Yangshan. According to a United Press report from Shanghai on the 24th: The growing movement against the resumption of Sino-Japanese trade has reached a climax. The "Federation of Machine-Made National Goods Companies" issued a statement on the 24th, summarizing the general feelings of Chinese businessmen on this issue. The statement said: "At a time when China's war-damaged industry has not yet recovered, trade with Japan means a disastrous economic invasion of our country by Japan. For the future of Chinese industry, we will resolutely oppose this step." The United Press reported that the prospect of resuming trade with Japan would cause a slump in the Chinese cotton cloth market, as textile workers believe that China cannot compete with cheap Japanese products.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th] Tokyo dispatch: The sinister attempt of American imperialism to support the resurgence of Japanese zaibatsu is becoming increasingly blatant. MacArthur recently approved a loan of 1,114 million yen for the equipment of 23 Japanese coal mines. These companies own 90% of Japan's total coal mines. It is reported that after obtaining this loan, Japanese mining can increase its current annual coal production from 24 million tons to 30 million tons. Among them, Mitsui and Mitsubishi Coal Mining Co., Ltd. received the largest amount of loans, with Mitsui receiving 363 million yen and Mitsubishi receiving 263 million yen. MacArthur's move completely exposed his recent announcement of the so-called liquidation of the Mitsui and Mitsubishi zaibatsu as a complete deception of world opinion, and their financial power remains as strong as ever. It is estimated that Mitsui's monthly turnover alone reaches 350 million yen at official prices.

    【新华社陕北二十六日电】据美联社南京消息：中国工业协会为反对开放中日贸易，特组成一代表团于二十四日由沪赴京，要求国民党当局停止对日贸易之开放；该代表团包括工业家潘仰山等人。另据美联社上海二十四日消息：日益增长之反对恢复中日贸易运动已趋于高潮。“机制国货公司联合会”二十四日发表了一项声明，总汇了中国商界人士对此问题之一般感想，该声明称：“当此中国被战争毁坏之工业尚未恢复之时。与日本贸易，其意义即系日本对我国作灾难性经济侵略。为了中国工业前途，我们将坚决反对此一步骤。”合众社称：与日本恢复贸易之前途即为引起中国棉花布匹市场萧条，因纺织业工人认为中国不能与日本廉价生产品竞争。
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】东京讯：美帝国主义扶持日本财阀再起之阴险企图越发露骨，麦克阿瑟近已准贷款十一亿一千四百万日元，供日本二十三家煤矿装备之用。这些公司拥有日本全国煤矿总量的百分之九十。据息，日本矿业获得此项贷款后，即可将目前每年煤产量二千四百万吨提高到三千万吨。其中三井、三菱煤矿株式会社所得贷款数目最多，计三井为三亿六千三百万日元，三菱二亿六千三百万日元。麦氏此举，完全暴露了其最近宣布所谓清算三井、三菱财阀之举全是欺骗世界舆论，两者在金融上的势力雄厚如故。据估计仅三井会社每月营业数就达官价三万五千万日元。
