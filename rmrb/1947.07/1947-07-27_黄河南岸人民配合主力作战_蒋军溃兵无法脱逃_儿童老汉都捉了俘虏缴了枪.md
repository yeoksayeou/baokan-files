　　People on the South Bank of the Yellow River Cooperate with Main Forces in Combat
  　Chiang Kai-shek's Remnants Cannot Escape
  　Children and Old Men Capture Prisoners and Seize Weapons
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 25th – Local armed forces and liberated peasants in the area south of the Yellow River in the Ji-Lu-Yu region have formed an inescapable net, cooperating with the counter-offensive army to encircle and capture Chiang Kai-shek's defeated soldiers everywhere. When the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's 55th Division, numbering over 90, attempted to sneak through the tall crops near Tianchang and Lihezhuang in Juancheng, they were surrounded by an iron wall formed by the 1st and 3rd district militia of the county. Local peasants also swarmed forward with hoes. Instantly, the sound of battle shook the area within a radius of several miles, and Chiang's soldiers, terrified, surrendered with their hands up. Over 40 rifles and 7 machine guns were seized. On the 14th, a unit of the 7th Military Sub-district's local forces, combined with militia and civilians, intercepted two battalions and a regimental headquarters of Chiang's fleeing soldiers near Mengguanji and Jiaoxing in Jiaxiang; over 300 officers and soldiers were captured alive, along with 4 mortars, 6 six-zero mortars, 24 light and heavy machine guns, and many other military supplies. The Nanwang Guerrilla Brigade captured 43 scattered soldiers near Tanggai on the 8th. He Bengu and two other militiamen from the Ranbei District in Dingtao captured 32 Chiang's soldiers who had slipped through the net at Hezhuangzhai on the evening of the 10th, seizing one machine gun and 8 rifles. Children's Corps members and old men in a village in the Qibin 3rd District, armed with wooden sticks, also captured 18 fleeing soldiers alive and seized one machine gun. Another fleeing soldier, carrying a gun, fled south, but was stopped by an old villager carrying water who raised his carrying pole to strike. The Chiang soldier panicked and knelt down, handing over his gun and dejectedly said, "I've been running all night, but I haven't escaped your circle!" The old villager replied, "Don't even mention you; even Sun Wukong can't escape from the palm of us common people!"
    [This newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 25th] After our great army crossed the Yellow River to the south, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang disintegrated. Five members of the enemy in Juancheng, including Lian Changxiu, surrendered to us with their weapons. Lian Changxiu was originally from Juancheng. During our great counter-offensive this time, the enemy in Juancheng fled in a panic. Lian Changxiu and the other four, on their way, organized and brought five large guns to the Juancheng Democratic Government to express their repentance. The Democratic Government, considering that they had not been wholeheartedly devoted to the enemy, decided to treat them leniently. In addition to educating them about their mistakes, they were rewarded for their organized surrender with weapons. The Democratic Government calls on all those who have been deceived, misled, or forced to serve the enemy to surrender with their weapons, repent, and turn to good. The government will not investigate past misdeeds but will deal with them leniently.
