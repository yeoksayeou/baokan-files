Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 6th: Over two thousand people and workers staged a demonstration against Chiang Kai-shek's tyranny in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway last month. It was the season of tall crops, and personnel of the Chiang regime stationed along the Longhai Railway north of Suqian were terrified of attacks by people's guerrillas and were sleeping in the fields every night. They strictly ordered each village to remove tall crops such as sorghum and corn within five miles on both sides of the railway and highway, otherwise they would be accused of colluding with "Communist bandits." As soon as this order was issued, public sentiment was outraged. Over two thousand residents and road workers from the Wayao and Paochu areas marched and demonstrated on June 10th, petitioning the Chiang-controlled Second District Office of Pihsien County in Paochu. The representatives of the masses said, "If we pull out the sorghum, we will starve to death. We would rather die than pull it out!" The Chiang authorities, intimidated by the power of the masses, were forced to agree: "This is an order from higher up. If everyone doesn't want to pull it out, then forget it." The anti-tyranny struggle was victorious.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: TASS reported from Shanghai on the 4th: "Shen Bao" reported: The rice riots in Chengdu are expanding daily. On June 30th, more than a thousand of the poorest men and women attempted to rush into the Sichuan Provincial Government, but were stopped by military police. On the same day, another group of people, holding signs with the large characters "Famine," surrounded the city government.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: According to recent reports from Shanghai: The Chiang government broke its promise and greedily requisitioned 2.2 million piculs of land tax from Yunnan Province this year, sparking widespread opposition from the people of Yunnan. The actual land tax collected in the province in the 35th year of the Republic [1946] was 1.5 million piculs, which the Chiang government had promised to exempt. Later, under the pretext of "urgent need for military grain," it went back on its word and divided the exempted land tax into two equal parts to be collected in the 35th and 36th years. It was difficult to collect the amount for last year due to the decline of the rural economy, and this time the Chiang-controlled land and grain conference further increased the tax figure for Yunnan Province to 2.2 million piculs this year. The people of Yunnan, seeing that Chiang Kai-shek went back on his word and disregarded the lives of the local people, rose up in resistance. The Yunnan Provincial Government was also forced to send a telegram to Chiang, demanding that he keep his promise.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: According to Shanghai newspapers: In Suixi and Western Zhejiang, several thousand people successively blocked roads and stopped vehicles to prevent the Chiang government from transporting military grain out of the area. Suixi suffered a severe drought this spring, and the famine is serious. People are filling their stomachs with bran and chaff, but the Chiang government is still requisitioning large quantities of military grain in the area, causing grain prices to skyrocket. On a certain day last month, the Chiang government was about to transport 300 bags of grain at the Salachi Station on the Ping-Sui Railway, when local people and students were extremely indignant and immediately gathered thousands of people to lie on the tracks to block the transport. The Chiang government, ultimately intimidated by public anger, did not dare to proceed with the transport. A large amount of rice and grain was also plundered from Yuqian County in Western Zhejiang for transport out of the area. At the beginning of last month, three large trucks of grain were being transported out of the city from Machebu, and over a thousand people immediately, old and young, lay across the road to resolutely stop them. The Chiang-controlled county government, also fearing popular anger, did not dare to force the transport at that time.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 6th: The famine in the Chiang-controlled area of Northern Shaanxi is severe, and another rice riot has occurred in Shenmu. On June 20th, over a hundred starving people in the city destroyed the jointly operated mill and its warehouse run by officials and landlords, and seized grain. Chu Hung-kao, a Chiang army battalion commander, led ten soldiers to suppress them by opening fire. The starving people were filled with indignation and, regardless of everything, rushed into the courtyard, surrounded Chu, and demanded food. Seeing the situation was not good, Chu ran away, and the starving people chased after him along the street. The Chiang-controlled county government urgently ordered the police and city defense forces to set up machine guns at each street intersection, and only then dispersed the starving people and arrested twenty-six of them. Currently, the city is extremely short of grain, and Chiang's soldiers' daily rice ration has also been reduced from five 合 [approx. 0.5 liters] to three and a half 合. The soldiers are hungry all day long and their morale is unstable. To prevent riots, the Chiang-controlled county government often keeps the city gates closed, cutting off communication between the city and the countryside. (Note: A rice grabbing riot occurred in the county on May 27th; on June 4th, more than seven hundred villagers surrounded the county government, requesting exemption from grain levies.)

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 5th: Since the introduction of the ten thousand yuan Chiang currency in Jinan, price fluctuations have intensified, and the citizens have been plunged further into hunger. According to reports from Jinan: Previously, 100 catties [approx. 50kg] of wheat had already broken through the 300,000 yuan mark, each bag of flour reached 160,000 yuan, and each ton of coal cost 1.7 million yuan, and there was a price but no market; the prices of all goods have soared by one-half compared to mid-May. The broad masses of the people cannot bear the cost of living, and rice and grain grabbing riots are constantly occurring. Teachers and staff with meager salaries are living in increasingly desperate conditions. Zhang Menglin, a teacher at Luankou Elementary School, hanged himself because his income was insufficient to make a living. More than five hundred students from Zhangdian Lin Middle School, who were previously forced to go to Jinan, are making a living by repairing roads, planting trees, and weaving straw sandals. The Lin Vocational School students from Fuyang, who arrived in Jinan, sent representatives to the Chiang-controlled Provincial Provisional Assembly after running out of food, requesting permission to beg for food in the streets. Eight hundred students from the Chiang-controlled Ministry of Education's Jinan Middle School Training Class ran out of food and begged in the streets in mid-May.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: According to the Tianjin "Republic Daily": The coal shortage in Qingdao is extremely serious. If the current situation continues, the entire island will enter darkness in the shortest time, all factories will stop work, and the kitchens will also run out of fuel. According to the power plant, if no more coal ships are imported, electricity will only be supplied to the waterworks. Electric stoves are currently prohibited in the city, and kerosene blowtorches have risen from 80,000 to 700,000. Another report: Jinan is facing an extreme shortage of fuel, and the power plant has stopped work. Ordinary citizens are using sweet potato dried as fuel.
