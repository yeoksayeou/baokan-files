　　Cao Gou Masses
  　Borrow Acres to Plant Seeds
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] Recently in Cao Gou, Xingtai's Fifth District, there was less than two fingers' worth of rain. Cao Zuohe came up with a method of borrowing acres to plant seeds. He completely dug out the dry soil from the seed pits, then dug wet soil from elsewhere and put it into the pits, before planting the seeds. He himself planted three mu, and this inspired the entire village to plant in this way, planting a total of fifteen mu. Now the seedlings have emerged from the soil.

　　曹沟群众
  　借垧点种
    【本报讯】邢台五区曹沟最近下了不到二指雨，曹作和想了个借垧点种办法，把点种子窑的干土，完全挖出，再把别处的湿土挖到窑里，然后才下种，他自己种了三亩，引起全村都这样种起来，共种了十五亩，现苗已出土。
