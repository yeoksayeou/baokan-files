    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 15th – In coordination with the military victories of the People's Liberation Army in successively capturing important cities such as Feixian, Tai'an, and Zaozhuang, the East China Liberated Area is launching a powerful mass political offensive, aiming to achieve the effect of "winning hearts is paramount." The Propaganda Department of the CCP East China Bureau and the Political Department of the East China Military Region have jointly formulated current propaganda slogans based on the CCP Central Committee's "July 7th" slogans on the current situation, divided into five categories: basic political slogans, slogans for the masses in guerrilla areas, slogans for the masses in Chiang-controlled areas, slogans for Chiang's troops, and slogans for Chiang's reactionary landlord militias. The content is simple and essential. For example, propaganda slogans for the masses in guerrilla areas include: "The Chiang family's regime is collapsing rapidly; resolute struggle will lead to victory." For Chiang's troops: "Don't be a soldier in Chiang's army, where families are broken and lives are wasted; be a soldier in the People's Liberation Army, where every person gets land." "The guns are American-made, but your life is your own; lay down your weapons and you will be treated with leniency."... The Shandong Dazhong Daily also published an editorial, pointing out that the Chiang government's politics, military, and economy are facing a total collapse. In military terms alone, among the Chiang troops annihilated on the East China battlefield in the past year, the number of those who laid down their weapons has increased with each battle. During the seven battles and seven victories in Central Jiangsu, the number of Chiang troops who laid down their weapons was roughly equal to the number killed and wounded. Subsequently, the proportion gradually increased, accounting for 60% in the Suzhong Campaign, 70% in the Lunan Campaign, and as high as 80% in the Laiwu Campaign. Even when the 74th Division, which was touted as Chiang's "Imperial Guard," was annihilated, those who laid down their weapons accounted for 70%. This shows that Chiang's officers and soldiers are unwilling to risk their lives for the traitorous dictator. As long as someone points out a way to survive, they will leave Chiang Kai-shek at the first opportunity. The newspaper called on the entire East China Party, government, military, and people to pay attention to this change and launch this political offensive universally and deeply. More effort in winning over the enemy means less consumption and loss on the battlefield. This is not the work of a few people or specialized departments, but everyone's responsibility.

    华东展开强大政攻
    依据中央“七七”对时局口号
    对蒋区群众及蒋军作有力宣传
    【新华社山东十五日电】配合解放军连克费县、泰安、枣庄等重要城市之军事胜利，华东解放区正展开强大的群众性的政治攻势，以期收“攻心为上”之效。中共华东局宣传部与华东军区政治部已依据中共中央“七七”对时局口号，联合制订目前宣传口号，分为基本政治口号、对游击区群众、对蒋管区群众、对蒋军、对蒋记还乡团五类。内容通俗切要。如对游击区群众宣传标语口号有：“蒋家江山快垮台，坚决奋斗胜利就到来。”对蒋军者有：“当兵莫当蒋家军，妻离子散把命拚；当兵要当解放军，家中本人有田分。”“枪是美式的，命是自己的，放下武器就受优待。”………。山东大众日报亦发表社论，指出蒋政府政治、军事、经济都已面临总崩溃的危机。单就军事而论，一年来在华东战场上被歼蒋军中，放下武器者、一次比一次多。苏中七战七捷时，蒋军放下武器者和毙伤数差不多相等。以后逐次增高，宿北战役中占百分之六十，鲁南战役中占百分之七十。到莱芜战役竟占百分之八十。即被夸为蒋家“御林军”的七十四师被歼时，放下武器者亦占百分之七十，可见蒋军官兵并不愿为卖国独裁者拚命。只要有人指明一条生路，一有机会他们就会离开蒋介石的。该报号召全华东党政军民重视这一变化，普遍而深入地展开这一政治攻势。多一分争取工作，就少一分战场上的消耗与损失。这不是少数人或专门部门的工作，而是大家的责任。
