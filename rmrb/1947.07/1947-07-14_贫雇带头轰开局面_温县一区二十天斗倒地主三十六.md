    Poor and Hired Peasants Take the Lead in Breaking the Situation
    Wenxian County's First District Overthrows 36 Landlords in 20 Days
    [This newspaper's Wenxian County report] From May 23rd to around June 15th, the villages of Zhangzhuang, Zhangwangzhuang, Wangzhuang, and Luzhuang in the first district, comprising more than ten natural villages, saw a surge in struggle, and the mobilization was relatively full. There were ten struggle sessions in total, with 2,290 participants, 196 people recounting grievances, and 36 despotic landlords overthrown (including four newly overthrown). 1,416 mu of land were recovered, and the distribution of the fruits of struggle prioritized the allocation of good land near the villages to poor and hired peasants. Poor and middle peasants, as well as middle peasants who had moved to the village after their land had been destroyed by the Yellow River, also received land. The reasons for achieving such results are: first, cadres' thinking clearly accepted the policy of "facing the poor and hired peasants." The approach was to start from multiple aspects and pay attention in all situations. For example, in Zhangzhuang, they first found Comrade Ren Nianxian, who had worked in the village before, to introduce Zhang Weiba (formerly a dirt-poor person who sold manure and did manual labor, now the vice-chairman of the Farmers' Association). During a meal, they found Zhang Bingjin (a long-term laborer for fifteen years, without a house or land, now the village head). Bingjin then introduced Zhang Gen. In the training class, they discovered Wang Chunqiu, an old hired laborer of eighteen years (now the chairman of the Farmers' Association). With these poor and hired peasants as the foundation and backbone, the work was carried out. The situations in Wangzhuang and Luzhuang were similar. Zhangwangzhuang initially took a detour, focusing on old activists, but then quickly changed its approach, finding new dirt-poor people like Tian Hou, and the work also progressed quickly and well. Secondly, due to the threat of enemy rumors, many masses initially dared not attend meetings or meet each other. In Zhangwangzhuang, at the first meeting, there were over two hundred attendees, but only six were men, and they were all old men, and the women were all old women. The leading cadres did not lose heart because of this, but resolutely implemented the policy of holding more meetings and struggles, holding meetings with as few people as possible, and struggling as much as possible. The activist Tian Hou said, "People don't come back mainly because there are too few meetings (meaning too few struggles). If we hold a few more meetings, they will all come back." By talking, discussing, and clarifying the masses' questions, clearly explaining our attitude and policies, and stating that we will never leave this time. After each meeting, they mobilized the poor and hired peasants to connect with each other, describing the meeting situation, which target was struggled against, how the struggle was conducted, who received the near and good land, etc., trying every possible means to get people who were unwilling to show up to meet, so that they could feel at ease. When they felt that there was nothing wrong with meeting, more people would attend the meetings. (Kong Bin)

    贫雇带头轰开局面
    温县一区二十天斗倒地主三十六
    【本报温县讯】自五月二十三号至六月半二十天左右的时间，一区张庄、张王庄、王庄、陆庄等四个行政村十多个自然村，轰动起来斗争，而且发动的比较饱满。前后斗争十次，参加人数二千二百九十从，诉苦的一百九十六人，斗了三十六个奸霸地主（内有新斗的四个），收回土地一千四百一十六亩，果实分配是尽先让贫雇分上好地近地，贫苦中农及黄河将地冲坏搬到这村参加斗争的中农也分到土地。其所以能取得如此成绩：首先在干部思想上明确接受了：“面向贫雇”的方针。作法是：多方面着手，各个场合注意，如张庄首先找过去在这村工作的任念先同志给介绍了张尾巴（从前卖大粪下力气的赤贫，现当农会副主席），吃饭时又找到了张丙金（十五年长工，房无一间地无一亩，现任村长），丙金又给介绍了张根，训练班发现了十八年的老雇工王春秋，（现任农会主席），以这些贫雇为基础为骨干，把工作搞起来了。王庄、陆庄也是如此，张王庄开始走了弯路，在旧积极分子身上打圈子，以后马上改变了方针，找到了新的赤贫田候等，工作亦同样开展的很快很好。其次由于敌人谣言的威协，最初很多群众不敢开会，不敢见面，张王庄在第一次开会时到会二百余人，只六个男人，还都是老汉，妇女都是老太婆。领导骨干并不因此泄气，而是坚决的执行多开会多斗争，有几个人开几个人的会，能斗争成啥样斗啥样的方针，积极亦贫田候说：“人不回来主要是开会少（斗争少的意思），多开几次会就都回来了”。多讲多谈多讨论，解除群众的问，明确说明我们是啥态度，啥政策，这一次再也不走了。每次会后，就发动贫雇串通贫雇，开会情形；斗了那个对象，怎样斗的，谁分到了近地好地等，想尽办法让不愿露面的人见面，使他心情安定下来，他感到见面也没啥，因此开会的人就多了。（孔彬）
