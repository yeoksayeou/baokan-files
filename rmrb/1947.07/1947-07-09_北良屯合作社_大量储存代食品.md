　　Beiliangtun Cooperative
  　Large Quantities of Substitute Foods Stored
    [Report from Neiqiu by Our Newspaper] The Beiliangtun Cooperative in the Second District has always enthusiastically served the masses according to their needs. In mid-June, after the cooperative's director, Wang Zhengui, returned from a base-level meeting, he discussed further famine preparedness work with everyone. All of the cooperative's share capital was used for famine preparations. The cooperative stored 4,000 jin of flower seeds, intending to eat them, and stored 10,000 jin of oil cakes. These 14,000 jin of substitute foods are enough for the entire village to eat for more than 40 days. The director also negotiated with the Gongyi Oil Mill in Xingtai and borrowed 700,000 yuan to lend to them for oil pressing to earn oil cakes. They have already sold 40 shi of rapeseed, which can earn more than 4,000 jin of oil cakes. The money earned from the sales can then be used to buy more substitute foods. The cooperative also bought 800 jin of turnip strips from Songjiazhuang and sold them to the masses at low prices, saving them 320,000 yuan. All the staff members also quickly mobilized, trying every possible way to save and prepare for famine for the masses. The director and purchasing agents ran around every day to buy substitute foods for the masses. Recently, they bought 31 jin of turnip seeds from Liulin Town, enough to plant 120 mu of vegetables. The cooperative originally had three livestock animals; now, they have sold the donkey to prepare to buy substitute foods and are also preparing a lot of buckwheat and radish seeds. (Shao Hua, Yi Wu)
    [Report from Taiyue by Our Newspaper, July 7th] Under the slogan "Hoes for drought resistance, mouths for saving," the emancipated farmers of Yangcheng are deeply engaged in production, drought resistance, savings, and famine preparation. Around June 10th, various villages began hoeing the autumn seedlings for the second time, and nearly 26,000 mu of grain seedlings have been almost completely hoed. The masses of Zhangxun Village established a Production and Savings Committee to conduct household inspections and random checks on time. On June 16th, under the leadership of production team leader Zhang Mugui, Xiyu Village launched a competition to hoe the seedlings for the second time, breaking the previous restrictions between groups and villages. In ten days, all 1,675 mu of grain seedlings were hoed, and 70% of the corn was hoed. In addition, 39 surplus laborers were put into sideline production, such as carrying goods and digging medicinal herbs, earning 240,000 yuan. There have also been great achievements in savings; in total, the entire village saved 43 shi and 5 dou of millet in June and collected more than 14,500 jin of wild vegetables. Dongye Village paid special attention to ideological leadership. On the 24th of last month, they gathered the villagers to recall the suffering of the 1932 famine to overcome the phenomenon of waste among the masses. Cadres also led the masses to collect substitute foods. In one day, they picked 2,900 jin of persimmon flowers and 5,000 jin of wild vegetables. Wu Qiyun, the director of the Farmers' Association, and his family of three picked 40 jin of persimmon flowers and 50 jin of wild vegetables in three days, completing the plan of 10 jin of dried substitute foods per person. Currently, everyone in the village has completed 7 jin of dried vegetables, and it is stipulated that each person saves one he of grain per day, which is expected to save 216 shi. Everyone has the confidence to overcome the famine.
