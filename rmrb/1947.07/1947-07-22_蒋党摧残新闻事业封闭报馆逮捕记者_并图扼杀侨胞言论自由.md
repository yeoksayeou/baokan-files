Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th—The news industry in the Chiang-controlled areas has suffered an unprecedented catastrophe since the beginning of March this year. According to extremely incomplete materials published in Chiang-controlled newspapers, the following newspapers have been closed down for upholding the just position of the people: Chongqing Xinhua Daily, Minzhu Bao (Democracy Daily), Shanghai Wenhui Bao, United Evening News, and Xinmin Evening News. The following 23 newspapers were forced to cease publication due to paper rationing: Nanjing's Da Zhong Daily, Chao Bao, Capital Evening News; Shanghai's Min Guo Daily, Shen Zhou Daily; Jiangsu's Chen Bao, Jiangsu Provincial Daily, Jiangsu Zheng Bao; Beiping's Shimin Daily; Hankou's Da Zhong Bao; Wuhu's Anhui Min Bao; Qingdao's Min Zhi Daily, Gong Yan Bao, Min Zhong Bao; Tianjin's Jian Guo Daily, Social Daily, Hebei News, and Minsheng Daobao. (According to an Associated Press dispatch of the 12th: Another daily newspaper and two evening newspapers have been sealed in Wuhan). The newspaper offices destroyed included: Sichuan Huayang County's New China Daily, Changchun's Hua Sheng Bao, Fujian's Minzhu Bao, Gulangyu's Yuzhou Bao, Suzhou's Ming Bao, Su Bao, Wuhan's Wuhan Times, Wuxi's Ren Bao, Wuhu's Fuxing Daily, Dajiang Daily, and Gongshang Bao, among others. The destruction of Changchun's Hua Sheng Bao was solely because it reprinted a "Northwest Corner of China" dispatch, which mentioned that some people in the northwest border region (referring to the Chiang-controlled area) were so poor that they had no pants to wear. The destruction of three newspapers in Wuhu was due to the publication of a news item about a salary increase for Wuhu police. Hangzhou's Tian Xing Bao was suspended for a week simply for publishing an article entitled "Can Zhang Xueliang Regain His Freedom?" Its editor, Gao Luan, was even fired. News practitioners were detained and beaten by Chiang's bandit troops and police. Examples include Changsha Police Chief Li Xiaobai hanging and beating Yan Zifu, a distributor of the city's Xiaochunqiu Daily; and the magistrate of Putian County, Fujian, detaining Xu Wenxiu, the president of the county's Jianguo Evening News, and more than 40 staff members. Recently, six journalists in Fuzhou were arrested by the Chiang government for exposing corruption in the Water Conservancy Bureau. The Wuhu Police Bureau detained Huang Chaosheng, the interview director of the Xingfu Evening News, and the Kunming Inspection Office unreasonably seized Wang Junshi, a reporter for the Fu Chunming Bao. As for the journalists arrested and disappeared by Chiang's bandit secret agents, they are too numerous to count. In Chongqing alone, 26 journalists were arrested during the martial law imposed on June 1, including eight from Ta Kung Pao, eight from Xinmin Bao, six from Minzhu Bao, five from Shijie Daily, Shangwu Daily, and Jishi Xin Bao, and the former editor-in-chief of Xinmin Bao was also among those arrested. At the same time, several reporters from the China Times were arrested during the martial law in Kaifeng. Huang Bing, Yao Fangzao, and Yang Xuechun, reporters from the United Evening News and Wenhui Bao in Shanghai who were forced to cease publication, and Chen Fan, a special correspondent from Guangzhou Ta Kung Pao, and Zhang Chen, a reporter from Shanghai Xinmin Bao, were also arrested without cause. The total number of news workers arrested or beaten is more than 90.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th—The Chiang government is attempting to strangle the freedom of speech of overseas Chinese. According to a United Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 16th, the Chiang-controlled Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission ordered that all newspapers and magazines published by overseas Chinese must be registered with the commission through Chiang's embassies, consulates, or educational organizations controlled by the Chiang government. Overseas Chinese newspapers and magazines that the Chiang government deems to have published "illegal speech" or "harmful to China's (Chiang government's) foreign relations" will be banned in China (Chiang-controlled areas), and their publishers will be deprived of the right to return to the country. United Press also reported that the Chiang government is giving overseas Chinese publications a daily threat, stating that the Chinese (Chiang government) representative offices abroad have been ordered to "constantly 'advise' and 'assist'" registered Chinese publications.

　　蒋党摧残新闻事业封闭报馆逮捕记者
  　并图扼杀侨胞言论自由
    【新华社陕北十八日电】蒋管区新闻事业本年三月初以来遭遇空前浩劫。据蒋区报纸所载极不完全材料统计，因坚持人民正义立场而被封闭者，有重庆新华日报、民主报、上海文汇报、联合晚报、新民晚报。因统制纸张而被迫停刊者有南京之大中日报、朝报、首都晚报，上海之民国日报、神州日报，江苏之晨报、江苏省报、江苏正报，北平之市民日报，汉口之大中报，芜湖之安徽民报，青岛之民治日报、公言报、民众报，天津之建国日报、社会日报、河北新闻、民生导报等二十三家。（另据美联社十二日讯：武汉又有一家日报和两家晚报被封）。被捣毁之报馆有四川华阳县之新中国日报，长春之华声报，福建之民主报，鼓浪屿之宇宙报，苏州之明报、苏报，武汉之武汉时报，无锡之人报、芜湖之复兴日报、大江日报、工商报等家。其中长春华声报之被捣毁，只因转载了一篇“中国西北角”通讯，说及西北边陲（指蒋管区）有穷得没裤子穿者而已。芜湖三家报纸被捣毁，是因刊了一条芜湖警察加薪的消息。杭州天行报仅刊载“张学良能恢复自由吗？”一文，即被停刊一周，该报编辑高鸾竟遭开除。新闻从业员被蒋贼军警扣打者，有长沙警察局长李肖白吊打该市小春秋日报发行人员晏子复，福建蒲田县长扣押该县建国晚报社长许文修及工作人员四十余人。最近福州六记者因揭发水利局贪污而遭蒋政府逮捕。芜湖警局扣押幸福晚报采访主任黄潮声，昆明检查处无理票傅春明报记者王君实等。至于被蒋贼特务逮捕失踪之记者更不可胜数，仅重庆六月一日戒严一次即捕记者二十六名，内大公报记者八人、新民报记者八人、民主报记者六人、世界日报、商务日报、及时事新报记者共五人，新民报之前任总编辑亦在被捕之列。同时，开封戒严亦捕去中国时报记者多名。沪被迫停刊之联合晚报、文汇报记者黄冰、姚芳藻、杨学纯，广州大公报特派员陈凡、上海新民报记者张忱亦均无故被捕。以上被捕被殴新闻工作者即共达九十人以上。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】蒋政府妄图扼杀海外侨胞言论自由。据合众社十六日南京讯报导：蒋记侨务委员会十六日命令海外华侨出版的一切报纸杂志，经由蒋记大使馆、领事馆或蒋政府控制的教育团体向该委员会登记。国外华侨报纸杂志，倘经蒋政府认为登载“非法言论”或“妨碍中国（蒋政府）对外关系”者，将在中国（蒋管区）下令封禁，并褫夺其出版者返国之权利。合众社并报导蒋政府给予华侨刊物以日常威胁称：国外之中国（蒋政府）代表机关，已奉命对业经登记之中国刊物“经常‘劝告’及‘协助’”。
