Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd -- Washington dispatch: Polish Ambassador to the United States, Weinivezhi, told reporters on the 21st that there would be no world peace if German industry were allowed to recover. Weinivezhi stated that Polish diplomats are visiting governments of various countries to protest any plan that would give Germany greater priority than the Allied nations of World War II, or give Germany the opportunity to become an industrial giant in Europe. Poland is shocked that Germany will receive US assistance to modernize its factories at the expense of its neighbors. Weinivezhi also recalled that Germany was able to recover quickly after World War I and launch World War II because of US loans.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd -- London dispatch: The diplomatic war between Britain, France, and the US, caused by the US Ruhr plan, continues to unfold. According to Agence France-Presse, London dispatch: Well-informed sources here announced on the evening of the 22nd that the French government has sent a note to the British government, expressing concern about the US plan to increase Ruhr industrial output, disregarding the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement. French Ambassador to the UK, Massigli, repeatedly emphasized France's views on this issue in talks with the British Foreign Secretary. The well-informed sources also stated that Bevin, in his meeting with US Ambassador to the UK Douglas, also expressed fears about the US intentions. According to Su: In the meeting between Bevin and Douglas on the 21st, Bevin may have reiterated the suggestion that the US expand the two countries' Ruhr coal production conference to discuss the entire economy and food issues of the British and American occupation zones in Germany. Given that the 50% of the costs of the Anglo-American joint occupation zone that Britain must pay recently is putting great pressure on Britain's depleted dollar reserves, and the Ruhr plan proposed by the United States blatantly demands that Britain hand over control of the Ruhr, putting Britain in an awkward situation, Britain may adopt a delaying policy on this.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th -- According to the Associated Press: Simultaneously with the US proposal for a Ruhr production increase plan, Marshall issued instructions to Clay, the commander of the US occupation zone in Germany, instructing the new US policy towards Germany, fundamentally abandoning the Potsdam Agreement. The directive stated that an orderly and prosperous Europe also requires the economic contribution of a stable and productive Germany. Marshall instructed Clay that the main task from now on is to make the western occupation zones of Germany self-sufficient and capable of "helping" the economic recovery of the whole of Europe.

The Washington correspondent of the British Workers' Daily reported on this: "Observers from the right to the left believe that Marshall's directive to Clay has completely exposed the motives of the Marshall Plan - that is, the construction of Europe is to be carried out around a strong capitalist Germany. Marshall's decision is generally regarded in Washington as a turning point in the US post-war policy towards Europe."

　　美又扶助德国胁威世界和平
  　波抗议美对鲁尔计划
  　英法对美斗争仍在继续展开
  　美对德新政策暴露马歇尔计划真形
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】华府讯：驻美波兰大使魏尼唯支二十一日告记者称：若令德国工业恢复，则无世界和平可言。魏氏称：波兰外交官正分访各国政府，以抗议给予德国较二次大战同盟国还要大的优先权，或使德国有机会成为欧洲工业巨头的任何计划。波兰对于德国将获得美国协助使其工厂现代化而以其邻国为牺牲一点，甚为震惊。魏氏并追述第一次大战后德国之所以能很快恢复，并发动二次大战，就是靠了美国的贷款。
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】伦敦讯：英法美之间关于美国鲁尔计划问题所引起的外交战，仍继续展开中。据法国新闻社伦敦讯：此间消息灵通人士二十二日晚宣称：法国政府顷向英政府致送照会，对美国不顾波茨顿协定之规定计划提高鲁尔工业产量一事表示忧虑。法驻英大使马西格里在与英外相晤谈中，曾一再强调法国对这个问题的观点。该灵通人士并称：贝文与美驻英大使道格拉斯会谈时，也表示对美国的意图怀抱恐惧。据苏：二十一日贝文与道格拉斯会谈中，贝文可能再次提出建议，要求美国将两国鲁尔煤产会议扩大，而讨论德境英美两占区整个经济与粮食问题。鉴于最近英国必需付出之英美联合占领区费用的百分之五十，正给英国涸竭的美元储备一种极大压力。而美国所提鲁尔计划，又明目张胆要求英国交出鲁尔控制权，使英国处境难堪；英国可能对此采取拖延政策。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】据美联社讯：与美国提出鲁尔增产计划同时，马歇尔向德境美占区司令官克莱发出指令，指示美国对德新政策，而根本抛弃波茨顿协定。该指令宣称：一个有秩序与繁荣的欧洲，也要求一个稳定与生产的德国在经济上之贡献。马歇尔指示克莱，今后主要任务是使德国西部占领区自给自足，并有能力“帮助”全欧经济恢复。
    英国工人日报驻华府记者对此报导称：“马歇尔给克莱的指令，从右派到左派的观察家俱认为是把马歇尔计划的动机暴露无遗，——这就是欧洲的建设要在强大资本主义德国周围进行。马歇尔的决定，在华盛顿方面咸认为是美国战后对欧政策的转捩点。”
