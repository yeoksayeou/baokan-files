    Chiang Army on the Border
    Covertly Buys Wheat
    [Report from the border region of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, July 10th] The Chiang army is experiencing a severe grain shortage and is conducting large-scale covert purchases of grain. We are strengthening our anti-smuggling efforts. After the wheat harvest, the enemy troops in the border area of Yanjin County are both sending large armed forces to seize grain and using traitorous merchants to buy it at high prices. It was recently discovered that in the market towns south of Weiqiu, large numbers of merchants are secretly using large amounts of Chiang currency to buy wheat, transporting it to enemy areas day and night, causing grain prices in nearby market towns to soar. According to investigation, in our Kouzhuang New Town, one *dou* (thirty *jin*) of wheat costs 15,000 Chiang currency. Transporting it to the area south of Weiqiu in enemy territory, only about thirty *li* away, it sells for 34,000 Chiang currency per *dou*, yielding a profit of more than double. After our democratic government became aware of this, it immediately strengthened control over the markets and intensified anti-smuggling work, strictly prohibiting the export of grain. Recently, during intensified inspections at the front lines, two merchants were found carrying 10 million Chiang currency into our central area to purchase wheat, and a horse-drawn cart was also found in Liwen Village, fully loaded with wheat and 700,000 Chiang currency. The government immediately confiscated the goods and currency and detained the merchants for interrogation. The merchants confessed that they were buying grain for the Chiang army, which is worthy of vigilance in all areas.

    边沿蒋军
    套买小麦
    【本报冀鲁豫十日电】蒋军发生严重粮荒，进行大规模套买粮食。我正加强缉私工作。麦后延津边缘区敌军，一面派大部武装进行抢粮，一面利用奸商高价收买。最近发现卫邱以南各集镇大批商贩，暗中推销大量蒋币购买麦子，昼夜私运敌区，因此附近集镇粮价飞涨。据调查，在我寇庄新镇买一斗麦子（三十斤）用蒋币一万五千元，运往敌区卫邱以南一带，仅隔三十余里，每斗即卖到三万四千元，可赚一倍以上。我民主政府查觉后，即一面加强管制市集，一面加紧缉私工作，严禁粮食外运。最近前哨加紧盘查中，曾查出二商人携带蒋币千万元进入我中心区收购麦子，并在李文村盘查出一马车，除满载麦子外，尚有蒋币七十万元。政府即予没收，并将扣押审讯，该商品供为替蒋军收购，值得各地警惕。
