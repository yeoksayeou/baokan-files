Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Tianjin Newspaper reports: Prices in Taiyuan are soaring, and shops are closing down one after another. In recent months, more than a hundred shops have closed. The "Yuanxingtai" small sundries shop on West Street, due to losses amounting to 600 million yuan, led to the head shopkeeper committing suicide by poison, and the second shopkeeper fleeing without a trace. Furthermore, due to Yan Xishan's large-scale conscription in Taiyuan City, many young men in the city fled. Many shop managers also left with their partners, hanging their household registration booklets on top of bamboo poles, fluttering in the wind in front of their doors, to express their protest against Yan Xishan's tyrannical rule.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Associated Press, Shanghai, 24th: A mimeographed publication, News Communications, recently published the results of a survey on the declining purchasing power of one hundred families since 1937 (pre-war), listing the details as follows: 1937 – two cows, 1938 – one cow, 1941 – one pig, 1943 – one chicken, 1945 – one fish, 1946 – one egg, 1947 – one-third of a box of matches, 1948 – only heaven knows what.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 26th: Primary school education in the Chiang Kai-shek occupied areas of the Northeast is scarred and dilapidated. In the primary and secondary schools in areas such as Bamiancheng, Dawa, and Bajiazi along the Middle East Railway, there are very few students. Most of the school buildings are overgrown with weeds. In the desolate classrooms, besides the hanging portrait of Chiang Kai-shek and slogans such as "Knowing Propriety, Righteousness, Integrity, and Shame," there are no other facilities. The treatment of teachers, which was already meager, is further reduced through repeated deductions, making their lives miserable. The teaching staff of the central primary school in Ershijiazi have had their salaries in arrears since the end of last year. After the school authorities pleaded day and night, they only received 20,000 yuan in Chiang Kai-shek's currency, which also included repair and office expenses. Recently, a folk song circulating locally describes the life of teachers in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas of the Northeast: "Better to have two dou of grain at home than be a children's king; if you become a children's king, you'll have to sell your sons and daughters and watch your old mother die."

　　太原商店纷纷倒闭
  　蒋区人民购买力日益下降
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】津报讯：太原物价飞涨，商店相继倒闭。近数月来，商店倒闭者已达百余家。西街“源兴泰”小杂货铺即因亏累达六亿元之巨，大掌柜服毒毙命，二掌柜潜逃无踪。更由于阎锡山在太原城大肆抓丁，市内壮丁相率逃亡，许多商店经理也随伙友一起出走，出走前并将户口簿系于竹竿顶端高悬门首，迎风飘舞，以表示对阎锡山暴政的抗议。
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】美联社上海廿四日讯：此间油印刊物新闻通讯，顷发表对一百个家庭自一九三七年（战前）以来购买力逐年下降情形之调查结果，列表说明为：一九三七年——两头牛，一九三八年——一头牛，一九四一年——一只猪，一九四三年——一只鸡，一九四五年——一条鱼，一九四六年——一个鸡蛋，一九四七年——三分之一盒的火柴，一九四八年——只有天知道是什么了。
    【新华社东北二十六日电】东北蒋占区小学教育满目疮痍，凋敝不堪。中长路两侧八面城、大洼、八家子等地的中小学校，学生寥寥，大部分校舍已荒草没地，凄凉的课堂里除了孤悬着蒋介石相片和“明体义知廉耻”等口号外，便无其他设备。一般教员待遇，原来就菲薄，加之一再克扣，生活苦不堪言。廿家子的中心小学，教职员薪俸从去年年底拖欠迄今，经校方朝夕哀求，结果仅拨下两万元蒋记流通券，其中还包括修补费与办公费。最近当地流行着一首歌谣描绘东北蒋管区教员生活道：“家有二斗粮，不当孩子王；当了孩子王，卖儿鬻女死老娘。”
