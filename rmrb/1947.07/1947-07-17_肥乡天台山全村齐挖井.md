    Feixiang News: On July 4th, the cadre from Tiantaishan Village, Fourth District of Feixiang, returned from a county meeting. The next day, they convened a village meeting to explain the need to overcome natural disasters and the idea of conquering nature, stating that we should not rely on the heavens for our livelihood. After the mobilization, the whole village was in a frenzy, with men, women, old, and young all participating. The militia dismantled the temple to dig wells, the women's association and children's corps were responsible for scraping and moving bricks onto carts, the old men's team cut stakes, the mutual aid plowing teams collaborated, and the carpenters worked together, not even stopping for lunch. The militia teams from the four streets challenged each other, guaranteeing sufficient size and water in the wells, and seeing who could finish first. The branch and village cadres took the lead, and in six days, a total of thirty-two wells were completed. The whole village said, "We finished digging the wells and it won't delay planting seedlings. Poor people couldn't dig wells in the past, but now that we have wells, we can plant the land. This is all thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!" (Dezong)
