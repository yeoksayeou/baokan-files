　　[Taiyue Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 19th] The Lu Jiahe Mutual Aid Group of the Shangguan Mutual Aid Brigade in Yangcheng County convened a general meeting of all group members and cadres on the 10th of this month to summarize the production work of the past six months: (1) Under the leadership of production committee member Lu Jiahe and female labor hero Bai Rusai, 60 households in the village have successively joined the mutual aid team. The number of people organized accounts for 88.2% of the total population of the village. (2) The power of organization has been brought into play, surpassing that of machines, and agricultural and sideline production has exceeded that of any previous year. Agricultural production: In the past six months, an average of 60 loads of manure per mu have been applied; grain and corn have been hoed twice, and cotton has been hoed three times and topped once. It is estimated that 398 workdays have been saved in six months, approaching the standard of saving one workday for every two workdays. Sideline production: spinning, weaving, transportation, silkworm rearing, silk reeling, and pig raising have brought an average income of 8,925 yuan per person in six months. After summarizing the advantages and achievements, everyone humbly reviewed the shortcomings of the first half of the year. The main problem was the failure to organize and utilize the surplus labor effectively, which reduced income. In the first half of the year, from January 1st to May 15th, a total of 160 days, the male and female full and semi-labor force participating in mutual aid in the village should have totaled 23,372 workdays, but only 9,746 workdays were actually used, accounting for only 41.2% of the total workdays. The remaining 13,626 workdays, accounting for 58.3% of the total workdays, were largely not organized for production but were consumed in daily cooking, childcare, making clothes and shoes, attending meetings, visiting relatives, and watching operas. The main reason for this phenomenon is that each household has not yet established a plan, and the mutual aid organization has not included the handling of surplus labor in its plan. As a result of the meeting's review, it was unanimously agreed that every household should formulate a plan for prosperity in the second half of the year, propose the number of workdays for household use, and ensure that the ratio of "agricultural work six, sideline work two, and consumption work two" is achieved.

　　卢家河互助组确定后半年方针
  　有计划使用剩余劳力
    【本报太岳十九日电】阳城上官中有互助大队卢家河互助组，本月十日召集全体组员干部大会，总结半年生产工作：（一）半年来在生产委员卢家河及妇女劳动英雄白如赛领导下，全村六十户先后参加了互助队。组织起来的人数占全村总人口百分之八八·二。（二）发挥了组织起来顶机器的力量，农副业生产超过了以往任何一年。农业生产：半年来每亩平均上粪六十担，谷、玉茭已锄过两遍，棉花锄过三遍，并打切过头遍。计半年省工三百九十八个，将达到两工省一工的标准。副业生产：纺织、运输、养蚕、打丝、喂猪每人平均半年收入八千九百二十五元。总结了优点与成绩后，大家又虚心地检讨了前半年的缺点，最主要是对余工没有很好组织使用，减少了收入。前半年由正月一日至五月十五日一六○天内，全村参加互助的男女全半劳力应为二三三七二个工，但实用工九七四六个，仅占总工数百分之四一·二，余工一三六二六个，占总工数百分之五八·三，大部分工没有组织到生产上面、而消耗到日常做饭、看娃、做衣服鞋袜及开会游亲看戏等上面去了。所以造成这种现象的原因，主要是各家尚未订立计划，互助组织也没有把处理余工列进计划里去。会议检讨结果，一致通过下半年家家要订发家计划，提出家庭用的工数，保证做到“农业工六，副业工二，消耗工二”的比例。
