[This report from our Jinnan office on the 18th] Xiajin Nanwangzhuang has re-divided land in a rational and equitable manner. During the large-scale struggle last year, a total of 291 mu of land were seized. When distributing the land, a small number of people monopolized the process, allocating 2.6 mu per person to fill the quota, distributing a total of 203 mu. The remaining 88 mu were nominally reserved for those who were away from the village, but in reality, this was intended to sabotage the process. Although the land deeds had been drawn up, they were not implemented; only wooden stakes were placed, and these were all removed by people gathering firewood. After sowing the land this spring, the boundaries remain unclear, and people cannot distinguish "yours" from "mine." The poor masses actively demanded a re-division of the land. After deliberation and coordination, the land has now been redistributed, with 3 mu allocated per person to fill the quota.

    夏津南王庄重新合理分地
    【本报冀南十八日电】夏津南王庄重新平均合理分地。该庄去年大动时，共斗出土地二百九十一亩，分配时少数人包办，每人按二亩六分填平，共分下去二百零三亩，余下的八十八亩名义上是给出外者留的，实际是想捣鬼，这样分配以后，文契虽已立了，但没有实行，只插了一个木棍，均被拾柴的人拔去了。今春耩上地后，至今分不清地界，你的我的也分不清。贫苦群众积极要求重新分地，经过酝酿串连，现已按每人三亩填平。
