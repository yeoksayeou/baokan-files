　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 11th: Moscow dispatch: The Czechoslovakian delegation, including Prime Minister Klement Gottwald, Foreign Minister Jan Masaryk, Minister of Justice Jaroslav Stránský, and other Czechoslovakian officials, arrived in Moscow from Prague on the 9th. Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov, Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Vyshinsky, and other senior Soviet government officials welcomed them at the Central Airport. In a radio address at the airport, Gottwald stated: The delegation of the Czechoslovakian government has come to Moscow for political and economic negotiations. We are very pleased that our arrival here will allow for a thorough understanding of the needs of our people and government. The Czechoslovak-Soviet alliance, tested by blood and flesh in the struggle against fascist Germany, has also fully proven its correctness in the years of peaceful construction. A free and independent Czechoslovakia is inconceivable without an alliance with the Soviet Union. I would like to tell the Soviet people that the Czechoslovak people fully feel fortunate to have such a sincere and strong good friend as the Soviet Union. I have no doubt that this time, as before, the results of the negotiations will take us one step further on the path of our cooperation. Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Joseph Stalin and Foreign Minister Molotov met with Gottwald and others on the same day for approximately two hours.

    捷代表团抵苏
    谈判政治经济合作
    【新华社陕北十一日电】莫斯科讯：捷克总理哥特瓦尔德、外长马萨利克、司法部长德提那及其他捷克官员代表多人，于九日由捷京抵达莫斯科，苏联外长莫洛托夫，次维辛斯基及苏政府，其他高级官员均到中央机场欢迎。哥特瓦尔德在机场发表广播演说称：捷克政府的代表团到莫斯科来是为了政治和经济上的谈判。我们很高兴我们的到达，在这里可以得到对于我们人民和政府的需要的彻底了解。在法西斯德国的斗争里，用血肉考验了的捷苏同盟，在和平建设的年月也充分地证明它的正确。没有与苏联的同盟，一个自由独立的捷克是不能想象的。我愿意告诉苏联人民，捷克人民充分感到有苏联这样真诚和强大的好朋友之幸运。我毫无疑问，这次一定和以前一样，而且谈判的结果，一定能在我们合作的途程上又前进一步。苏联部长会议主席斯大林与外长莫洛托夫即日接见哥特瓦尔德等，会议二小时许。
