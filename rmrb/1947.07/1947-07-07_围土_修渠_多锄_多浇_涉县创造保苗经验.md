　　Shexian Creates Seedling Protection Experience
　　[This newspaper's Shexian dispatch] In Shexian this year, during the mobilization for a production increase, frugality, and famine preparedness movement, after the slogans "Remember the suffering of past disasters" and "Strike first to gain the upper hand, delay and suffer, plant one seedling as one counts," most villages carried out mutual aid to rush plant and spot plant spring millet, spring seedlings, and cotton and other crops. But now that the summer solstice has passed and the minor heat is approaching, and it has not rained, the masses have had a change in thinking. The masses in Taicun Village, Fourth District, and other villages believe: "There is no hope, might as well sit and wait for death!" Therefore, the village is full of idlers, not making a living, nor trying to protect the seedlings. Most of the seedlings have died from drought. Although they were planted, if no measures are taken to protect the seedlings, it is equivalent to not planting. This is the most serious problem at present. For example, in Taizhuang, Seventh District, and Beiguan, Ninth District, some cotton has grown to four or five inches tall, but has been killed by the drought. It is really a pity. This problem needs to be solved urgently. Leading comrades in various places must grasp this situation and quickly change the masses' waiting and hoping for luck, and thinking that nothing can be done, and actively participate in the work of protecting small seedlings. Some villages have created many experiences in this seedling protection work: (1) "Enclosing the seedlings with soil." For example, because of the drought, the roots of the millet seedlings in Wangjinzhuang were mostly exposed to the soil. It was difficult for them to grow well. Labor hero Cao Shankui seized this link, applied his own experience, and mobilized the whole village to universally enclose the seedlings with soil, which is both drought-resistant and prevents wind from blowing them down. (2) Hoeing the seedlings more and thinning them out quickly. In particular, many cotton plants are spot planted throughout the county. After emerging from the soil, the seedlings are very dense, with twenty or thirty seedlings in each spot. Because of the lack of rain, the masses are afraid to hoe the seedlings. Zhao Fucheng, a labor hero from Haozhao, Sixth District, based on his many years of experience, suggested that cotton should be hoeed more to make the soil even and easy to grow, and to thin out the dense seedlings, leaving three or four seedlings per spot (and then leaving one after it rains). When thinning, the fat seedlings should be left, and the heads of the seedlings that should be thinned should be removed. The remaining stalks still contain moisture, and the living seedlings can borrow to protect the seedlings from dying. (3) Mobilizing to hunt raccoon dogs. Because most of the land in Shexian is close to mountain slopes, raccoon dogs eat seedlings everywhere, which is also very serious. It is said that in a village in the Sixth District, the millet and corn seedlings in the land near the mountain slopes were all bitten to death by raccoon dogs. In order to prevent this, the county Armed Forces Committee has notified various districts to mobilize the masses to hunt raccoon dogs, which is also a good way to protect seedlings. (4) Mobilizing more watering in areas with water. Wherever possible, mobilize the masses to draw water to water, and carry water to water in dry land near the river. For example, Baijiao, Seventh District, immediately organized the repair of ditches, and 200 mu of seedlings can be watered again; the Yongshun Canal in the Sixth District can be used to water corn in three to five days after it is repaired; some of the masses in Shangqingliang organized to carry water three times to water the cotton, and the cotton is growing very vigorously. (Zhisheng, Wenbin, Huafeng)
　　[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 5th] Jiyuan actively repairs ditches and reclaims wasteland to overcome drought and increase production. The ten major canals in the county, including Guanghui, Dali, Xiaoli, Lifeng, Yongli, Guangji, Qiancang, Shangxia Yan, Ganquan, and Anquan, have been repaired. The small canals in Pip, Kangcun, Wangzi, Yangdazhuang and other villages have also been repaired. The irrigation area accounts for one-sixth of the county's cultivated land area. The reclaimed wasteland has also reached 16,012.8 mu. In order to combat drought, 11,764 mu of cotton have been additionally planted. In particular, the increase of more than 3,000 head of draft cattle, which were rushed to the next crop after wheat, overcame the difficulty of labor and played a great role. Generally, three households have one head of cattle in each village, and two households have one head of cattle in villages such as Taijiao and Qili. There are two ways to add livestock: one is to raise funds to run transportation, earn money to buy livestock, and sell them to team members at the original price. The other is a mutual assistance association for buying cattle. Whoever sells cattle in this month, who raises funds for them, is entirely to buy cattle through mutual assistance and mutual benefit.
　　[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 5th] Fushan Shizhenming Labor Mutual Aid United Brigade has achieved remarkable results in drought resistance by implementing early planting and more hoeing. Old hero Shi Zhenming convened a meeting of the United Brigade on the third day of the second lunar month and decided to "prevent drought every year and plant drought-resistant seedlings." On the third day, he also made an appeal to the team members of various villages at the Zhaige Pagoda fair, so all 8,745 mu of corn and 7,860 mu of millet in the entire brigade were planted in a timely manner. Now the corn is two feet long and the millet is one foot long, and the mountain slopes and river beaches are lush. On June 19, a production inspection was carried out. The heroes and mass representatives inspected each team, showing infinite joy. They all admitted that the old hero Shi Zhenming was leading well. Zhang Deliu's father was helping others build dams and repair canals when the entire brigade was busily planting. By the time he finished, the weather was already dry. As a result, he planted three times, and only the "five-six millet" had some seedlings. He sighed and said, "Old hero Shi Zhenming has foresight." When hoeing the seedlings, heroes Wang Fuquan and Zhao Meiying led more than 20 team members to hoe the millet and corn twice, the soil was loose and preserved moisture, and it was very drought-resistant. As of now, the entire brigade has hoeed the corn twice and the millet once, the ground is very clean, without a single weed, which is the result of listening to the old hero.

　　围土·修渠·多锄·多浇
  　涉县创造保苗经验
    【本报涉县讯】涉县今年发动生产节约备荒运动中，经过“回忆过去灾荒的痛苦”及“先下手为强，后下手遭殃，种了一棵算一棵”等口号下，大部村庄都进行了互助抢种点种，春谷春苗及棉花等作物都一律下种。可是现在夏至已过，小暑快来，一直没有落雨，群众在思想上有了变化，四区台村等村群众认为：“怎么也没有希望，干脆坐着等死吧！”因此村里满街坐着闲人，没有生活做，也不设法保苗，大部分苗子旱死，虽然种上，如果不设法保苗，也等于不种，这是目前最严重的一个问题。象七区台庄，九区北关等村，有部分棉花已长到四、五寸高，都被旱死，实在可惜，这个问题是目前急需解决的问题，各地领导同志都必须掌握住这个情况，让群众的等待侥幸，及怎么也不行等思想迅速转变过来，积极地参加保护小苗工作。这个保苗工作，有些村庄已创造了不少经验：（一）“用土围苗”，象王金庄谷苗因天旱，苗根大部露出土面。七倒八倒很难成长，劳动英雄曹善魁即抓住这个环节，应用自己的经验，发动全村普遍用土围苗，既耐旱，又免风刮倒。（二）多锄苗快间苗，特别是全县点种棉花很多，出土后，苗子都很稠，一窑有二三十棵，因为缺雨，群众又不敢锄苗，六区郝赵劳动英雄赵甫成，根据自己的多年经验，提出棉花应多锄苗，使土匀和，容易生长，把稠苗间开，每窑留三四棵（等落雨后再留一棵），间时肥苗留下，应间的苗把头去掉，剩下的秆子，还存在水份，活着的苗可以借用保护苗子不死。（三）发动打貉狑，因为涉县大部土地都靠近山坡，貉狑到处吃苗，也非常厉害，据说六区一个村，靠山坡地的谷苗、玉茭苗都被貉狑咬死了，为了防止，县武委会，已通知各区，发动群众打貉狑也是保护苗很好的办法，（四）有水地区发动多浇，靠近河边旱地尽可能发动群众打水浇，担水浇，象七区白茭马上组织修渠，二百亩苗子又能浇；六区永顺渠修理后三五天，即能下水浇玉茭，上清凉有部分群众组织三次担水浇棉花，棉花很旺。（志胜、文彬、华峰）
    【本报太岳五日电】济源积极修渠开荒克服旱荒，增加生产。全县广惠、大利、小利、利丰、永利、广济、千仓、上下堰、甘泉、安泉等十条大渠，业已修复。琵琶、康村、望子、杨大庄等村小渠亦全修好。灌溉面积占全县耕地面积六分之一。开荒亦达一万六千零十二亩八分。为了抗旱，增植棉花一万一千七百六十四亩。特别增加三千余头耕牛，在麦后抢上回茬，克服劳力困难，起了很大作用。一般村作到三户一头牛，太噍、绮里等村已作到两户有一头牛。增添牲口的办法有两种：一种是集资跑运输，赚钱伙买牲口，按原价卖给组员。另一种是买牛互济会。这牛月谁卖牛给谁集资，完全是以互助互济来买牛的。
    【本报太岳五日电】浮山石振明劳动互助联合大队实行早种、多锄，抗旱成绩卓著。老英雄石振明于阴历二月初三召开了联合大队会，即决定“年年防旱、抗旱下种”，第三天并在寨圪塔集上对各村组员做了号召，所以全大队八千七百四十五亩玉茭，七千八百六十亩谷子全部及时下种。现玉茭长二尺，谷一尺，山边河滩一片蔚然。六月十九日，并进行了生产检查，各英雄及群众代表各队检查，显出无限的愉快，都承认老英雄石振明领导有方。张德六的父亲在全大队已经紧张下种的时候，他却与人互助打坝修渠，等到做完之后，天已显旱，结果种了三遍，仅“五六谷”有一点苗，他叹惜的说：“石振明老英雄就是看得远。”当锄苗的时候，英雄王福全、赵美英带领二十多个组员把谷子玉茭都锄了两遍，土质疏松，保存了水份，很耐旱。截至目前，全大队玉茭锄过两遍，谷锄过一遍，地里非常干净，无一棵杂草，这是由于听了老英雄话的成果。
