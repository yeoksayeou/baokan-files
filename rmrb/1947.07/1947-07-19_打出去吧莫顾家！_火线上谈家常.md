　　Charge Ahead, Don't Worry About Home!
　　Talking About Family Matters at the Front Lines
　　Li Wenbin

　　Li Huanchang, the village education director of Beipo Village, Second District, Huixian County, represented the villagers in visiting the new soldiers from their village in the 203rd Unit at the front lines. Everyone was extremely warm upon meeting, shaking hands and chatting freely:

　　"Is your life good?"

　　"Good! The cadres care about us a lot, we eat better than at home, and the comrades are all very good to us. How is the work in our village now?"

　　"It's great! Everyone has started mutual aid groups, and the families of those resisting the enemy are having their land cultivated for them, and all the work is done in advance. Comrade Wang Guanshan, your grain has already been hoed and the seedlings are growing well. Comrade Hu Jinbang, your mother has no difficulty getting firewood or water, and her life is even better than when you were at home!"

　　"How is my family?"

　　"Your family is even better! Those four mu of land far away have been exchanged for land near the door! The two rooms have been exchanged for three! Comrade Wang Jingchen: your family has been given nine pieces of clothing, as well as tables and chairs. Besides your father cultivating his own land, all of yours is being cultivated by others."

　　Comrade Li asked, "How is my family?"

　　"Ha! Your wife is doing very well at home, with no worries about firewood, water, or grain. She has also been given some furniture, tables, chairs, and stools, and the house has been completely renovated. She is also working very enthusiastically in the Women's Rescue Association."

　　"She's having a good time then!"

　　"The work in our village is really booming now!"

　　The five new soldiers all smiled and said, "We don't have to worry about our families! We have to work hard, or we'll be letting down the people in the village."

　　Before leaving, the director left each of them 1,000 yuan of Jicha (冀钞) for spending money. The soldiers each wrote a letter home, telling their families about life in the army. The entire company sent a letter to the village cadres and families of those resisting the enemy. As they parted, they encouraged each other: "Go back and tell the people! We must work hard, bring honor to our village, and eliminate Chiang Kai-shek to protect the fruits of our liberation."

    打出去吧莫顾家！
    火线上谈家常
    李文彬
    辉县二区北坡村民教主任李焕昌代表全村群众到前方二○三部队慰问该村的新战士。大家见面分外亲热，互相握了手便畅谈起来：
    “你们的生活好吧！”
    “好！干部对我们很关心，吃的比在家还好的多，同志们对我们都很好。咱村里现在工作怎样？”
    “可好哪！大家都搞起互助组来，抗属的地都是代耕，啥活也做在前。王官山同志，你的谷已锄开苗了，麦子熟了就先给你收麦子。户金榜同志，你母亲烧柴吃水啥也不困难，比你在家的生活还好哩！”
    “我家哩？”
    “你家更好哪！那四亩远地换成门口地啦！两间房换成三间啦！王敬臣同志：你家分了九件衣服，还有桌子、椅子。你的地除你爹他耕的外，全部代耕。
    李同志问：“我家怎样？”
    “哈！你媳妇在家可好哩，烧柴、吃水、粮食都不愁，这次还分到一些家俱、桌、椅、凳都有，家里焕然一新。她在妇救会工作也很起劲。”
    “她倒很痛快啦！”
    “咱村的工作现在搞的可轰烈哩！”
    五个新战士听了都笑眯眯的说：“咱可不忧家啦！可得好好加油干，不然就对不起村上群众。”
    临走时，主任又每人给留下一千元冀钞叫他们零花。战士们每人往家写了封家信，把部队的生活告知家庭。全连给村干抗属寄了一封信。临别时互相都在勉励着：“回去向群众说吧！我们一定要加油干，为咱村上争光，消灭了蒋介石保住咱们的翻身果实。
