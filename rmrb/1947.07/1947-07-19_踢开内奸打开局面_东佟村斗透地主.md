Kicking Out the Internal Traitor Opens the Situation
Dongtong Village斗透Landlord

[This newspaper, Jilu豫 (冀鲁豫) 17th dispatch] During the review in Dongtong Village, First District of Shou County, the conspiracy of the landlord was exposed, and the poor and middle peasants united to investigate the landlord. In the autumn of 1933, the landlord Tong Qishun infiltrated the village government and became the village public security officer, taking control of the village leadership. At the beginning of the struggle, the landlord Tong Xumeng was lightly criticized. Then, eight middle-peasant households were criticized. On the surface, it was very intense, but the main rulers, such as the landlords Tong Xulun, under the cover of Tong Qishun, transported a large amount of grain and floating wealth to other villages. Tong Qishun became the first person in the village to stand up for things, arresting whoever he wanted, flattering the higher authorities in every possible way, and the masses dared not speak out about their grievances. When the land reform began this year, the poor peasant Tong Yanxin was trained in the district and exposed the landlord's tricks, determined to fight the landlord. The masses elected Yanxin as the chairman of the farmers' association. Then he led a stretcher team to the front line with the army. When he returned to the village a month later, six middle-peasant households had been criticized in the village, and the whole village was in panic. Yanxin then convened a general meeting of all poor and middle peasant members to discuss who should be criticized and who should not, and explained that the middle and poor peasants were all one family and should unite to eliminate the landlords. The middle peasant Tong Shidou offered a millstone and an ox, but the farmers' association resolutely refused, and the middle peasants' morale rose. Then, the major landlords Tong Xulun, Tong Shunrong, and Tong Xianfu were liquidated. Four fox fur coats and many silk clothes were found in the home of Tong Xulun alone. The village also reviewed that in the past, there were disagreements and twelve wealthy middle-peasant households were criticized, but the landlords were criticized very lightly. The root of the problem was Tong Qishun. The masses unanimously demanded that Tong Qishun be detained, and a struggle meeting was held. More than 30 people spoke out angrily on the spot, completely exposing Tong Qishun's crimes of deliberately criticizing middle peasants to cover up the landlords. Since then, the poor and middle peasants of the village have united, and a thorough review is now underway.

    踢开内奸打开局面
    东佟村斗透地主
    【本报冀鲁豫十七日电】寿张一区东佟村复查中，揭穿地主阴谋，中贫农联合起来清查地主。三十三年秋，地主佟启顺打入村政权，当了村公安员，掌握村里领导。斗争开始，轻描淡写的斗了地主佟续孟，接着连斗了八家中农，表面上是很轰烈了，但主要统治者佟续伦等地主在佟启顺的掩护下，把大批粮食浮财都运到外村。佟启顺成了全村第一个撑劲的人，说绑谁就绑谁，对上级百般奉承拉拢，群众满肚子冤屈不敢说。今年土地改革开始，贫农佟彦新到区里受训，揭发了地主诡计，决心斗争地主。群众选彦新当了农会长，接着他带领担架随军到前方，一个月后回村时，村上已斗争了六家中农，全村人心惶惶。彦新便召开贫农中农全体会员大会，讨论谁该斗谁不该斗，并说明中贫农都是一家人，要齐心消灭地主。中农佟世斗献磨献牛，农会坚决拒绝，中农情绪高涨起来。接着便向大地主佟续伦、佟顺荣、佟先福等进行清算，仅佟续伦一家即查出狐皮皮袄四身，绸缎衣服很多。村里并检讨出过去互相间闹意见，斗了十二户富裕中农，地主却斗的很轻，坏根都在佟启顺身上，群众一致要求把佟启顺扣押起来，召开了斗争大会，当场有三十多人激愤发言，完全揭发了佟启顺有意斗中农掩护地主的罪行。从此该村贫农中农团结，现正深入复查。
