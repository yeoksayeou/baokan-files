　　After Discussion by Poor Peasant Groups
　　Tanzhuang Implements "Filling the Poor and Supplementing the Needy"
　　[Our newspaper, JiluYu, 22nd dispatch] In Tanzhuang, Nanfeng Fifth District, in the land reform, after three movements, the recent review of the distribution of fruits has realized the spirit of "filling the poor and supplementing the needy." The method of distribution is: farm tools, main furniture, clothing and bedding, and grain are first distributed to the poor peasants. After the remaining odds and ends are picked by the middle peasants, they are still distributed to the poor peasants. Military dependents are also assigned to groups according to their class status, and are given care when distributing items. In addition to rewarding model men and women with towels, shoes and socks, they are also distributed according to their class status. Poor peasants get what they lack, they make requests themselves, and the group discusses them. The review committee then reviews them, and appropriately reduces or increases the requests that are too much or too little. Grain is distributed separately. If the poor peasants' grain is not enough to last until autumn, it is replenished according to the shortage. The distribution of fruits to fill the poor and supplement the needy was achieved after a complex struggle between two lines. Before the distribution, the spirit of the distribution was discussed and determined in the poor peasant groups. The poor peasants said: "In the past, the middle peasants got one dou, and the poor peasants got five dou, but the middle peasants saved it and didn't need it, and the poor peasants had to pay debts, so now they are running out of food." Therefore, they advocated "get what you lack," "fill the big pits more, fill the small pits less, and don't fill the pits if there are none," and opposed the distribution by grade with the middle peasants. The middle peasants didn't have much opinion, and the old village cadres in the review committee also accepted it verbally; but in their minds, "the poor are pits that can't be filled," "the poor want things without end," "they have to be filled slowly," so in reality they were resisting "filling the poor and supplementing the needy." In the specific discussion and implementation, the old village cadres (of middle peasant origin) advocated discounting and distributing equally, saying that otherwise it would be impossible to distribute. Individual poor peasant representatives felt that there was no other way, and also agreed with this opinion. But after everyone discussed it, they felt that this was still going the old way, and it wouldn't work, but they couldn't come up with any new methods, so they distributed wheat first. More than 30 poor peasant households received one to four dou each. Some village cadres of former poor peasant origin who had received more land in the past and received more grain this year were not given anything, and they were dissatisfied, saying: "I am an old peasant association member, a poor peasant, but now I have been assigned to the middle peasants." For this reason, the review committee analyzed the whole village household by household, divided the classes, and redivided them into twelve groups according to three categories: extremely poor peasants, poor-middle peasants (mostly newly promoted in the land reform), and middle peasants. First, the extremely poor peasants and poor-middle peasant men and women were asked to submit lists of their needs, and after the groups discussed them (the group discussion did not play a greater role), the review committee collected the lists from each household and distributed them by group. At this time, several kinds of resistance occurred again: some village cadres suggested: the fruits distributed to each household should be worth about the same, otherwise it would be unfair, if you want more clothes, you have to distribute less furniture. When distributing clothes to each group, the village cadres were unwilling to take the good ones to the first four groups (extremely poor peasants), fearing that the ones behind would not get them. Some were afraid that "the poor peasants would not be fair among themselves, and the poor peasants would cause contradictions." Before the distribution was completed, the old village cadres and militiamen repeatedly shouted: "How to take care of the military dependents, militiamen, and middle peasants?" It was proposed at the meeting to solve this problem first, and to extract a batch of fruits for care purposes first. The middle peasants were unhappy when they saw that the poor peasants had already distributed grain, and now they were going to distribute things to the poor peasants again. Even individual cadres leading the work in the village wavered, wanting to take care of the middle peasants, military dependents, and militiamen. But under the poor peasants' policy of "filling the pits" and "giving whatever is needed," the distribution was still given to the poor peasants first, and it was clarified that "first fill, then take care of", the military dependents and militiamen were taken care of within their own groups. As a result, the poor peasants got more, and the middle peasants didn't have any opinions. Although some only got a small jar or a work basket, they were all very happy.

　　先经贫农小组讨论
  　谭庄实行填贫补穷
    【本报冀鲁豫二十二日电】南峰五区谭庄在土地改革中，已经过三次运动，最近复查分果实中实现了“填贫补穷”的精神。分法是：农具、主要的家具、衣被、粮食，先由贫农分，剩下的零碎东西，中农各挑一份后，仍由贫农分，军属也按其成份划在小组内，搭配东西时给予照顾。对男女模范班除奖励手巾鞋袜外，也完全按其成份分配。贫农少啥要分啥，先自己提出，小组内评议后，复委会再加以评议，对提出要求过多或过少者，适当予以减少或增加。粮食是单独分的，贫农的粮食吃不到秋的，即按缺少数补给。填贫补穷的分果实是经过复杂的两条路线斗争才实现的。分前，先在贫农组里讨论和确定了分的精神，贫农说：“过去中农分一斗贫农分五斗，可是中农存着用不着，贫农还帐后，现在要断粮。”所以主张“少啥要啥”，“坑大多填，坑小少填，没坑不填”，反对和中农按等级的分法。中农没什么大意见，复委会内的老村干口头上也接受了；但思想上是“穷人是填不满的坑”，“穷人要东西没够”，“得慢慢的填”，所以实际上还是抵抗“填贫补穷”。在具体讨论和执行中，老村干（中农成份者）主张折价按等分，说不然没法分。个别贫农代表感到没别的法，也附合这意见。但经大家讨论，认为这还是走老路，不行，但又搞不出什么新办法，就先分麦子。三十多家贫农每人分到一斗至四斗，一部分原贫农成份的村干过去得地较多，今年分粮食也较多者未分，不满意说：“俺是老农会员，是贫农，现在倒把俺分到中农里了。”为此，复委会把全村挨户分析了一下，划分了阶级，并重新按赤贫贫农、贫中农（多是土地改革新升者）中农三类划分了十二个组，先由赤贫贫农、贫中农男女提出自己需要的单子，经小组评议（小组评议未能起更大作用）复委会收集起各家的单子，即按组分配。这时又发生几种抵抗的意见：有的村干提出：各家所分的果实应该值钱差不多，不然就不公，衣服要的多，家具就得少分。往各组搭配衣裳时，村干不愿把好的拿到头四组（赤贫贫农）里去，怕后边的得不着了。有的怕“贫农内部分不公，贫农自己要闹矛盾”。在还未分好时，老村干、民兵就一次次的嚷着：“军属、民兵、中农怎样照顾？”会上提出先解决这问题，想先抽出一批果实作照顾用。中农看到贫农已分了粮食，现在要是再给贫农分东西，心里不高兴。甚至连领导该村工作的个别干部也动摇，要照顾中农、军属、民兵。但在贫农的“填坑”“要啥给啥”的方针下，还是先分配给贫农，并明确了“先填后照顾”，军属、民兵在本组内照顾，结果是贫农分的多，中农也没什么意见了。虽有的只得到一个小缸子、一个作活筐子也都很高兴。
