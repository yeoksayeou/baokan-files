　　Jizhong's Keliu Stronghold
  　Gu'an Increasingly Isolated
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 1st] A portion of the People's Liberation Army's local armed forces in northern Jizhong, at 2:33 AM on the 25th of last month, recovered Panggezhuang, an important Jiang-puppet stronghold 55 *li* south of Beiping. At the same time, another local armed force captured the Yufa stronghold on the highway north of Gu'an, as well as the Matouzhen, Dongxihuangzhuang, Liangjiawu, and Dongxiazhuang strongholds in the Liang (xiang)-Da (xing)-Wan (ping)-Zhuo (xian) area. Thus, the Jiang-puppet's traffic between Gu'an and Beiping was completely cut off, becoming increasingly isolated.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 1st] Over the past six months, the militia in eastern Hebei have achieved brilliant results in the war to protect the fields and love the country. From January to the end of May this year, according to incomplete statistics, they fought a total of 4,729 battles, carried out 286 explosions, killed, captured, and disintegrated a total of 1,832 Jiang-puppet *huohui* (local armed organizations of the Jiang army, controlled by local bullies, landlords, and former enemy-puppet personnel), destroyed 184 *li* of highways, 35 *li* of railways, and 35 bridges, destroyed 248 large township and fortress strongholds, and captured and destroyed seven locomotives, one armored car, and one tank, captured 205 rifles, more than 12,000 rounds of various ammunition, and a large number of other grains and materials.
