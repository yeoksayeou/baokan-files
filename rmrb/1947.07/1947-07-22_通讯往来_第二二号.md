  　No. 22
    I. The news written by Comrades Shuang Hong and Shi Xiu from the Shadi Zhan branch in the second district of Pingshun, regarding the inspection of production contracting for weeding, improving technology, and Li Shunda launching a competition, is very timely. It describes the process of advancing the weeding movement. However, it is not specific enough on how to improve technology. It is hoped that you will continue to closely follow and report on this.
    II. To the offices of the Second and Third Special Commissioner's Offices of Taihang, and the correspondents from Pingshun, Licheng, Zuoquan, Changzhi, and Wuxiang counties: Please continue to closely follow and report on the weeding movement. We hope you will make specific and vivid reports on how, after this weeding movement, to improve mutual aid and cooperation, make better use of labor, more closely organize full and semi-labor forces, and implement reasonable equal-value distribution of dividends, etc., all of which have been created by the masses.
    III. To the correspondents of the Third Sub-district of Southern Hebei and the First and Fifth Sub-districts of Taihang:
    Your area has had rainfall successively. Please vigorously report on the situation of rushing to plant and replant (including planting late autumn crops and autumn vegetables, etc.) and eliminating barren land, etc.
