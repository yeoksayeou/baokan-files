　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 27th: According to reports from various sources, Wedemeyer is preparing an aid-Chiang plan on the condition of completely dominating China, while Chiang Kai-shek is preparing to sell out our national interests on an unprecedented large scale to obtain American aid. According to a TASS dispatch from the 26th, citing reliable sources in New York: "Reports from American newspaper reporters from Nanjing suggest a conclusion that the Wedemeyer mission is considering an American aid plan to China, which will further place China under American control and impose a control system on China similar to that recently applied to Greece." In addition, according to an Associated Press reporter Horace's dispatch from Nanjing on the 24th, powerful senior American officials in Nanjing pointed out: Wedemeyer will take the route of openly providing massive aid to Chiang Kai-shek's civil war and revealed that the United States will use this "aid" to further control Chinese politics and economy. It is claimed: "The United States should send American advisors (these advisors are responsible to the American government) to ensure the proper and effective use of materials and money. Technical experts should also be sent to the Chinese government to implement modern public administration methods." The United Press reporter Sobrich's special dispatch from Nanjing on the same day also disclosed that the American aid-Chiang plan being prepared by Wedemeyer contains conditions that "infringe on Chinese sovereignty." On the other hand, due to the arrival of the "Taishang Huang" (retired emperor) Wedemeyer, the lackeys in Nanjing are sweating profusely. The top figures of Chiang Kai-shek's government are "preparing to submit mountains of documents and charts to Wedemeyer" (United Press). On the 26th, "the 'Economic Reform Plan' passed by the National Economic Commission has been translated into English; the Ministry of National Defense has prepared military materials, and the Executive Yuan will submit intelligence on the development of the Chinese political situation and issues of China's foreign relations to the Wedemeyer mission." (TASS) Chiang Kai-shek's civil and military officials, such as Hu Zongnan, Fu Zuoyi, and Li Zongren, who are commanding the civil war, as well as the chairmen of Chiang's provincial governments, Wei Daoming of Taiwan, Guo Jiqiao of Gansu, Zhu Shaozhou of Shaanxi, Liu Jianxu of Fujian, Shen Honglie of Zhejiang, Luo Zhuoying of Guangdong, and Wang Lingji of Jiangxi, have all gathered in Nanjing one after another to report on the military, political, and economic situation to Wedemeyer and will listen to his instructions. News from Nanjing shows that Chiang Kai-shek has made up his mind that as long as the United States saves his life, they will not hesitate to sell out everything in China. One example has been exposed in the Standing Committee of the National Political Council on the 25th. According to the Associated Press, "A member of the National Political Council opposed the industrial sector's request to postpone Sino-Japanese trade, saying: One of General Wedemeyer's tasks is to make China's (Chiang's government) policy toward Japan consistent with the policy of the United States; the world is divided into two camps, and although China (Chiang's government) is on the side of the United States, China's opposition to the resumption of Sino-Japanese trade is unstatesmanlike." It is generally believed that the summoning of the chairmen of Chiang's Taiwan, Fujian, Gansu, and Shaanxi provinces to Nanjing is related to Chiang Kai-shek's treasonous transactions with the United States. According to a previous report in the New York Afternoon Post, Chiang Kai-shek had proposed using Taipei, Keelung, Xi'an, and Dihua as American military bases in exchange for a new US$1.5 billion loan.

　　However, various sources still indicate that the United States lacks confidence in whether it can save Chiang Kai-shek, who is terminally ill. According to the United Press in Nanjing, the American aid-Chiang plan will cause protests from the Chinese people because it infringes on Chinese sovereignty.

　　It is also learned that Wedemeyer flew to Shanghai on the 26th to meet with the US Navy and commercial sectors and will fly back to Nanjing within days.

　　魏德迈企图完全支配蒋管区蒋介石准备空前大规模卖国
  　美国援蒋侵犯中国主权更将引起中国人民反抗
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】据各方连日报导：魏德迈正准备以完全支配中国为条件的援蒋计划，而蒋介石则正准备以空前的大规模出卖我国权益来取得美国的援助。据塔斯社二十六日讯引纽约可靠方面消息称：“美报记者自南京发来的消息暗示出一种结论，即魏德迈使团正在考虑美国援华计划，该计划将更进一步置中国于美国支配下，并将以如同最近施于希腊之管制制度，加于中国。”另据美联社记者何瑞区二十四日自南京报导，南京美国有力高级官员指出：魏德迈将采取公开大量援助蒋介石内战的路线，并透露美国透过此一“援助”，蒋进一步控制中国政治和经济，据称：“美国应派遣美国顾问（这些顾问向美国政府负责）以保证正当而有效的使用物资与金钱。技术专家亦应被派至中国政府，以便实行近代公共的行政方法。”同日合众社记者索勃里契的南京专电亦披露，正由魏德迈准备中的美国援蒋计划，包含“侵犯中国主权”的条件。另一方面因为太上皇魏德迈之到临，南京的奴才们忙得满头大汗。蒋介石政府的头等要人“准备向魏德迈提交堆积如山的文件和图表”（合众社）。二十六日“全国经委会通过的‘经济改革方案’业已译成英文；国防部已准备了军事材料，行政院则将以中国政局发展与中国外交关系问题之情报提交魏德迈使团。”（塔斯社）蒋介石的文武大员，如指挥内战的胡宗南、傅作义、李宗仁等，以及蒋记各省府主席，台湾魏道明、甘肃的郭寄峤、陕西的祝绍周、福建的刘建绪、浙江的沈鸿烈、广东的罗卓英、江西的王陵基等人，均已先后麇集南京，将向魏德迈报告军事、政治、经济情况，并将听训。来自南京的消息说明蒋介石已下决心，只要美国给他救命，他们便不惜出卖中国的一切，其中一例已暴露于二十五日的参政会驻委会中。据合众社称：当日会上“一位参政员反对工业界要求延迟中日贸易称：魏德迈将军的任务之一就是使中国（蒋政府）对日政策和美国的政策一致；世界分为两个阵营，中国（蒋政府）虽然在美国这一边，中国反对恢复中日贸易，有失政治家风度。”一般认为蒋记台湾、福建、甘肃、陕西等省主席之被召到南京，系与蒋介石对美国的卖国交易有关。据前此纽约下午报的消息，蒋介石曾提出建议，以台北、基隆、西安、迪化等地作为美国时事基地以交换美国新的十五亿美元借款。
    但各方消息仍然说明美国对能否挽救病入膏盲的蒋介石缺乏信心。据合众社南京宣称：美国援蒋计划因其侵犯中国主权将引起中国人民之抗议。
    另悉：魏德迈已于二十六日飞沪与美海军及商业方面会谈，日内仍将飞返南京。
