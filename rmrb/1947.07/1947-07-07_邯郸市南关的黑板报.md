　　Blackboard Newspaper of Nanguan, Handan City
    Zhao Han
    In order to make the blackboard newspaper a powerful weapon to promote work, under the guidance of comrades Lü Kun and Zhang Li, and with the direct assistance of Zhang Zhenghua, a teacher from the First Elementary School, Nanguan District of Handan City gathered several comrades enthusiastic about propaganda work to form a central group, which produced the blackboard newspaper at the mouth of Nandajie Street. The source of the manuscripts was that people in each street who could write promptly wrote the model figures and events found in their respective streets into quick rhymes and ballads and sent them to the central group for publication, which were coordinated with cartoons, arousing great interest among the masses. In just one month, the masses ideologically believed that being praised in the blackboard newspaper was the most glorious thing. The general public in Nandajie Street knew that doing bad things and being published on the blackboard newspaper was the most shameful thing. A militia team in Dongdajie Street shielded landlords and said strange things. After the village cadres' meeting decided to use the blackboard newspaper for criticism, it is said to be much better than before. After Nandajie Street Chief Han Guoxiu was praised, he quit smoking and drinking, and worked very actively, taking the lead in delivering public grain quickly and early, which influenced the entire street to complete this major task quickly.
    Under the influence of the central group, the ideological obstacles of many streets establishing their own blackboard newspapers were broken. When the central group initially asked the propaganda groups of each street for manuscripts, they all felt it was very difficult. The responsible comrades, on the one hand, pointed out in the meeting how to collect materials, and on the other hand, they saw the things that were published, and realized that their own streets also had such things, which was not as difficult as they imagined. Therefore, Beidajie Street, Dongcheng Corner, Nandalu Street, Southwest Village and other streets have successively established blackboard newspapers. As for the consolidation and expansion of the correspondent organization, etc., efforts are still being made.

　　邯郸市南关的黑板报
    赵寒
    为了使黑板报成为推动工作的有力武器，邯市南关区在吕坤、张力两同志的指导下，及一完小教员张正华同志的直接帮助下，集合了该区几个热心宣传工作的同志组成一个中心小组，在南大街口出黑板报。稿子的来源是由各街会写的人把本街发现的模范人物、事情及时写成快板歌谣送到中心组发表，并配合漫画，引起群众很大兴趣。仅仅一个月之中，群众在思想上已认为受黑板报表扬最光荣。南大街一般群众都知道作了坏事登上黑板报最丢人。东大街一个基干队包庇地主说怪话，村干部会议决定利用黑板报批评后，据说比从前好多了。南大街街长韩国秀受到表扬后，戒掉抽烟喝酒的习惯，工作干得很积极，送公粮打头炮，又快又早，影响全街很快完成这一重大工作。
    在中心小组的影响下，打破了许多街自己建立黑板报的思想障碍，中心小组起先向各街宣传组要稿子时，他们都觉得很困难，负责同志们一方面在会议上指出怎样搜集材料，另一方面他们看见登出的东西，自己街上也有，并非想象那样困难。因而北大街、东城角、南大路、西南庄等街都先后把黑板报建立起来了。至于巩固与扩大通讯员组织等问题尚在继续努力中。
