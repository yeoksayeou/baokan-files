[This dispatch comes from our newspaper in the Taiyue region on the 20th] The production and thrift movement in Yuebei counties has been widely and deeply developed, and has already achieved great results. The Second General Management Office of the Taiyue Wine Monopoly precisely calculated and reduced its organization, which can save more than 5.74 million yuan throughout the year. The Finance Office system has also set off a wave of meritorious service in production and frugality. The trade companies of Huo County and other three counties saved 2,943,000 yuan throughout the year. In addition to subsidizing public miscellaneous expenses through amateur production, the Jiexiu Post Office requires seven cadres to hand in 2,000 yuan per person per year to the public, and to save 230 jin of millet. In cleaning up the accounts of the organs, the Second District of Qinyuan completely turned over 9,600 jin of mobile relief grain retained from last year to the public. At the expanded cadre meeting in the Second District of Zhaocheng on June 14, a total of 30,000 yuan worth of grain and vegetable funds were donated in one go. Eleven cadres in Anze returned 250 jin of millet previously received to the administrative office. Gu County organized laborers to return all the combat rations and fodder saved on the way to transport the wounded to the prefectural commissioner's office. This movement has also aroused enthusiastic response in the schools. All the teachers and students of six schools in Qinyuan have formulated detailed production and thrift plans. They have made specific studies from various daily necessities, and after 40 days of experiments, they are confident of completing the 800,000 yuan handover plan for the four months from May to August. The Second Simplified Normal School has earned and turned over 18 dan and 5 dou of millet to the public from May 11 to 17.
