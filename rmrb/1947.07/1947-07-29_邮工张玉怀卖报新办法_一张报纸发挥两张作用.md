　　Postman Zhang Yuhuai's New Method for Selling Newspapers
  　One Newspaper Serves the Purpose of Two
    [Our Newspaper, Xingtai News] Due to the frequent visits of merchants from various places to Xingtai City, there is a certain amount of retail newspaper sales each month, but because the number of newspapers is limited, many people cannot buy them. Comrade Zhang Yuhuai, the postman in charge of retail newspaper sales at the Xingtai City Post Office, came up with a solution to ensure that everyone could see the newspaper. As soon as the newspapers arrived, he sold them street by street. After selling out, he returned to the readers who had bought the newspaper earlier, explained the contents, bought them back at the original price, and then went to sell them again, so that one newspaper could serve the purpose of two, solving the difficulty of having too few newspapers. He runs more than 20 *li* back and forth every day to adjust the newspapers, not minding the fatigue at all. In addition, he is also very active in developing newspaper subscriptions. If someone buys a newspaper for retail three to five times, he will mobilize the reader to subscribe in advance. Therefore, the number of newspapers (People's Daily) in Xingtai City has increased from 300 to 400 copies in the past to more than 600 copies. (Yi Yun, Fu Shu, Jin Guo)

　　邮工张玉怀卖报新办法
  　一张报纸发挥两张作用
    【本报邢台讯】邢台市由于各地商人的来往，每月有一定数量的零售报，但因报数有限，许多人买不到。邢台市邮局负责零售报纸的邮工张玉怀同志，为了每个人都看到报，便想出一个办法，报纸一来，他挨街出售，售完了返回向先买报的读者解说，用原价买回，再去出售，使一张报起到二张的作用，解决了报少的困难。他每天往返廿多里的奔跑着调剂报纸，一点也不嫌疲劳。另外他对发展订报户，也很积极，有人零卖三五次报，他便动员读者预订，因此邢市的报纸（人民日报），由过去三四百份增为六百多份了。（一耘、复舒、进国）
