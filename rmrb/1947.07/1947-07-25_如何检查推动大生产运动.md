　　How to Inspect and Promote the Great Production Movement
　　Border Region Government

　　In order to further advance the production and preparedness movement, we should immediately conduct a comprehensive and in-depth inspection based on the Central Bureau's March 1st directive. Throughout the region, production work can be divided into two or even three types of areas: old areas with production experience (most of Taihang, Taiyue, and parts of Southern Hebei, Southern Shandong, and Henan), old areas without experience, and newly recovered areas where farmers have already been emancipated. In terms of production methods, there are plains and mountains, as well as the integration of urban and rural areas and industry and agriculture near small and medium-sized cities.

　　During the inspection, different areas should focus on different issues. Old areas should focus on: (1) the issue of the "three great combinations" or "four great combinations"; (2) how to expand the labor force and mobilize semi-laborers to participate in production; (3) agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, and technical issues; (4) how to develop credit cooperatives to support production; (5) various policies regarding the rich peasant economy, etc. New areas should focus on: (1) the integration of mass movements and production; (2) how to rectify corvée labor and reorganize village finances; (3) how to organize and handle surplus labor; (4) how banks can provide loans to support emancipated households and solve their specific difficulties. Disaster-stricken areas should focus on inspecting various aspects of production and preparedness work. However, regardless of whether it is a new or old area, it is necessary to conduct an inspection of sown areas, continue to rush planting and replanting, eliminate wasteland, and launch a weeding and seedling protection campaign. And we must pay attention to how to use the experience of the old areas to promote the new areas, and combine it with the actual situation of the new areas, otherwise the new areas will feel that the requirements are too high and not very applicable.

　　We basically adopt the following three methods to inspect production: First, through the transfer of cadres by organizations at all levels, organize forces to conduct inspections. The Border Region Government must send people down, but because there are not many people, it cannot be universal. Taihang is the closest and has better connections. Southern Hebei, Southern Shandong and Henan have not yet shifted to production, so two groups of people are sent, one to Southern Hebei and one to Taiyue, to gather cadres from the prefectural, special district, and county levels of the two places. According to the intentions of the Party committees and administrative offices of these two districts, they will work with their cadres, submit to local leadership, and humbly learn from the masses and the vast number of cadres at the lower levels. At the same time, participate in production work briefings and discussions in the two places, so that typical understanding and general understanding are combined. The second is to grasp and explore materials, research materials, and write more letters to district and village cadres and labor heroes. Leading cadres of governments at all levels must adopt the attitude of primary school students, study the situation and problems. The more connections, the more materials, the more understanding, the more we can enrich our leadership. At the same time, we must also grasp the key points. We plan to have closer contact with Wu'an, Ci, and Handan counties, because there are plains, mountains, old areas, new areas, dry land, paddy fields, and urban-rural integration issues. Third, transfer people to report. We can raise different questions to different regions, and transfer cadres from counties and districts that are not too far away and cadres with production work experience from the administrative office or other departments to report on the situation and discuss issues.

　　And prepare to hold a labor hero symposium (a small number of heroes), a water conservancy meeting, and an agriculture and forestry meeting (technical meeting) this winter to summarize and exchange experiences, and plan to promote a larger-scale production movement next year.

　　Last year, during the emancipation movement, the Central Bureau organized emancipation teams, sending nearly a thousand cadres to the countryside, which played a great role in promoting the work. To promote this year's production work, the government must also put in the same effort. However, because the number of cadres has decreased due to simplification, the following should be done: (1) Organizations at all levels below the administrative office should consider organizing more forces, grasping the center of gravity, and the people who go down should strive to understand comprehensively and deeply into typical cases, summarize experience, and provide timely guidance. If they cannot grasp the center of gravity, they will achieve nothing. (2) We must cooperate well with all aspects, pay attention to the role of newspapers, cooperate closely, promote inspection work through newspapers, and learn from newspapers to improve our leadership.

　　Work closely with the Finance Office to solve how to guide prices to be conducive to production and the integration of agricultural and sideline industries; how to develop credit cooperatives, how to provide loans to support production, how to manufacture agricultural tools, and improve agricultural tools to serve farmers, etc.

　　如何检查推动大生产运动
    边区政府
    为了进一步推进生产备荒运动，我们应该即速根据中央局三、一指示，作一次普遍深入的检查。在全区来说，生产工作可分成两种乃至三种区域，即：有生产经验的老区（太行、太岳大部和冀南、冀鲁豫局部地区），没有经验的老区，和农民业已翻了身的新收复区。在生产方式上说，则有平原与山地及接近中小城市的城乡结合工农结合问题。
    检查时，不同区域，着重不同的问题，老区着重：（一）三大结合或四大结合问题；（二）如何扩大劳力与动员半劳力参加生产；（三）农林水利技术问题；（四）如何开展信用合作支持生产；（五）富农方向各种政策等。新区则着重：（一）群众运动生产相结合；（二）如何整顿支差及整理村财政问题；（三）如何组织起来，以及剩余劳力的处理；（四）银行如何贷款支持翻身户解决其具体困难问题。灾荒区着重检查生产备荒的各种工作。但无论新老区，都需来个检查播种面积，继续抢种补种，消灭荒地，锄苗保苗运动。并要注意如何利用老区经验推动新区，而又和新区实际相结合，否则新区会感觉提的太高不大适用。
    检查生产我们基本上采取以下三种方式：第一是通过各级组织抽调干部，组织力量进行检查，边府要派人下去，但因为人不多，不能普遍，太行离的最近，联系也较好，冀鲁豫还未转入生产，所以派两组人，一组去冀南、一组去太岳，会集二地的行、专、县干部，根据这两个区党委和行署的意图和他们的干部一块去作，服从当地领导，虚心向群众及下级广大干部学习。同时参加两地生产工作的汇报以及讨论，使典型了解和一般了解相结合。第二是掌握发掘材料研究材料，多写信给区、村干部劳动英雄，各级政府领导干部要采取小学生的态度，研究情况和问题，联系越多，材料越多，了解越多，越能充实我们的领导。同时还要掌握重点，我们打算和武安、磁县、邯郸三县联系的更密切些，因为这里有平原、有山地、有老区、有新区、有旱田、有水田，还有城、乡结合诸问题。第三调人来汇报，我们可以向不同的地区提出不同的问题，调路程不太远的各地县、区干部及行署或其他部门作生产工作有经验的干部来汇报情况，商讨问题。
    并准备今冬召开劳英座谈会（少数英雄），水利会议、农林会议（技术会议），以总结交流经验，计划推动明年更大规模的生产运动。
    去年翻身运动，中央局组织翻身队，将近千余干部下乡，推动工作作用很大。推动今年的生产工作，政府也须拿出同样力量来干，但因简政干部少了，所以应：（一）行署以下各级考虑更多的组织力量，掌握重心，下去的人既要力求了解全面又需深入典型，总结经验，及时指导，如不能掌握重心，就会一无所成。（二）须很好和各方面配合，重视报纸的作用，密切配合，通过报纸来推动检查工作和从报纸上学习改进我们的领导。
    和财办密切结合，解决如何指导物价，使有利于生产有利于农副业结合；如何开展信用合作，如何贷款支持生产，如何制造农具，改良农具为农民服务等。
