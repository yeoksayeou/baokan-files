　　Striving to Build a New Democratic Japan
  　Tokyo Japanese Communist Party Members Gather
  　To Commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the JCP's Founding
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Tokyo dispatch: On July 19th, the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Communist Party, despite the surveillance of a large number of military police outside the venue, 5,000 JCP members gathered to celebrate. JCP leaders Okano Susumu, Tokuda Kyuichi, and others delivered speeches, eloquently recounting the JCP's 25 years of indomitable and heroic struggle; and vowed to fight to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism and build a new democratic Japan. The congress concluded after singing the solemn Internationale.
    (Note: The JCP was founded in July 1922. From the day it was founded, it led the Japanese people in opposing Japanese fascism. At that time, the JCP struggled resolutely against Japan's dispatch of troops to Siberia. After the "September 18th" Incident, the JCP exposed the military's aggressive behavior and launched an anti-war movement. By 1935, the JCP had more than 3,000 members and 33,000 sympathizers. During the "July 7th" Incident, Japanese fascists more cruelly suppressed the JCP's anti-war movement, and many JCP leaders and cadres were arrested and killed. By 1945, the number of JCP members had been reduced to 1,200, and the party organization had been repeatedly destroyed; however, the JCP did not flinch because of the ruling class's bloody suppression. After Japan's surrender, especially after Tokuda Kyuichi's release from prison and Comrade Okano Susumu's return to the country, the Japanese democratic front greatly developed; now the JCP has 60,000 members and leads more than two million trade union members.)
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: Tokyo dispatch: The so-called "special economic measures" promulgated by the Japanese government will further worsen the impoverished lives of the Japanese people. The new price regulations increase the prices of rice, wheat, and other important foods by 2.75 times. Coal and train fares will increase by 3 to 3.5 times, while the average wage will only increase from 1,200 yuan to 1,800 yuan according to the June index.

　　为建立新民主的日本而奋斗
  　东京日共党员集会
  　纪念日共诞生二十五周年
    【新华社陕北二十日电】东京讯：七月十九日，为日本共产党创立二十五周年纪念日，不顾会场外面大批宪兵的监视，五千名日共党员仍于当日集会庆贺。到会日共领袖冈野进、德田球一等，均发表演说，畅述日共廿五年来不屈不挠的英勇斗争史；并誓为制止日本军国主义的复活和建立新民主主义的日本而奋斗。大会高唱庄严的国际歌后闭幕。
    （按：日共成立于一九二二年七月，从成立那天起，它便领导日本人民反对日本法西斯。当时，日共为坚决反对日本出兵西伯利亚而斗争。“九一八”事变发生，日共揭露军部的侵略行为，并掀起反战运动。一九三五年日共党员发展到三千以上，并有三万三千同情者。“七七”事变时，日本法西斯更残酷的镇压日共的反战运动，许多日共领袖及干部被捕杀。一九四五年日共党员减至一千二百名，党的组织也屡遭破坏；但日共并未因统治阶级血腥的弹压而退缩。日本投降后，特别是德田球一出狱和冈野进同志回国后，日本民主阵线大大发展了；现在日共拥有六万名党员，领导工会会员二百多万。）
    【新华社陕北十一日电】东京讯：日本政府颁布的所谓“经济特别措施”，将使日本人民的贫穷生活更形恶化，新的物价规定提高米、麦及其他重要食品价格二·七五倍。煤及火车费增加三至三点五倍，同时平均工资按六月指数仅由一千二百元增至一千八百元。
