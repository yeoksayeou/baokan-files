    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: Reports from various sources: After the Paris Three Foreign Ministers' Conference ended without result on the 2nd, Bevin and Bidault jointly issued invitations on the 3rd, inviting twenty-two European countries other than the Soviet Union to participate in the so-called "European Recovery Conference" scheduled to be held in Paris on July 12, to discuss the Marshall Plan. As of now, Italy, Portugal, and Austria have formally accepted the invitation, while Finland has formally expressed its refusal.

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: TASS, July 7th: The governments of Romania, Poland, and Yugoslavia have decided not to participate in the "European Conference" convened by Britain and France on July 12.

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: According to TASS, Moscow, 6th: A Pravda international observer commented on the so-called "European Conference" initiated by Britain and France: At a time when the Three Foreign Ministers' Conference has just ended, Britain and France immediately issued invitations to twenty-two countries to participate in the "European Conference" to discuss the "Marshall Plan." This fact proves that they are striving to break up the Three Foreign Ministers' Conference in order to carry out their unilateral attempts. The observer pointed out: As proven by the statement of the French Foreign Ministry spokesman, the organizers of the new conference are striving to make the participating countries accept the principles in the French plan. Therefore, in order to attend this conference, the invited countries must first accept the conditions put forward by Britain and France. The observer revealed that Britain and France accepted the orders of the United States and, in turn, wanted to establish their own commanding position on the "European cooperation" mechanism, wanting other European countries to subordinate their national interests to the will of "dollar diplomacy." The observer concluded: After the end of the Three Foreign Ministers' Conference, the clamor of foreign bourgeois newspapers to establish a "Western European Group" and "divide Europe" exposed the true intention of Britain and France to violate international cooperation and split Europe.

    违反国际合作阴谋分裂欧洲
    英法召开“欧洲会议”
    波南芬罗等国拒绝参加
    三外长会议后的欧洲
    【新华社陕北八日电】各方讯：巴黎三外长会议于二日无结果闭幕后，贝文与皮道尔即于三日联名发出请柬，邀请苏联以外之欧洲二十二国参加定于七月十二日在巴黎召开之所谓“欧洲复兴会议”，以讨论马歇尔计划。截至目前为止，意、葡、奥三国已正式接受邀请，芬兰已正式表示拒绝。
    【新华社陕北九日电】塔斯社七日讯：罗马尼亚、波兰、南斯拉夫三国政府已决定不参加七月十二日英法召开之“欧洲会议”。
    【新华社陕北八日电】据塔斯社莫斯科六日讯：真理报国际观察家对英法发起之所谓“欧洲会议”评称：在三国外长会议刚才结束之际，英法即立即发出请柬邀请二十二国参加讨论“马歇尔计划”的“欧洲会议”，这一事实证明了他们力求使三外长会议破裂，以便遂行他们的片面企图。观察家指出：有如法国外交部发言人声明中所证明的：新会议的组织者正力求使与会各国接受法国计划中的原则。因此，被邀请与会各国，为了出席这次会议，就必须事先向意英法提出的条件。观察家揭露称：英法接受了美国的命令，反过来又想在“欧洲合作”的机构上建立起自己发号施令的地位，想叫其他欧洲国家把国家利益屈服于“金元外交”的意志下。观察家结语称：三外长会议结束后，外国资产阶级报纸的叫嚣建立“西欧集团”与“划分欧洲”，暴露了英法违反国际合作与分裂欧洲的真意。
