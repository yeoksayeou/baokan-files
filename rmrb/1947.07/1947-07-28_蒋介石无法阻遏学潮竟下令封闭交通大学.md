　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 26th: TASS Shanghai, July 25th dispatch quoting Shanghai newspapers: Chiang Kai-shek has ordered the closure of Shanghai National Jiaotong University; the Chiang Kai-shek Education Ministry has received instructions to handle it. It is said that the authorities (referring to the Chiang government) believe there are more "undesirable elements" there than in other schools. Note: All students of Jiaotong University enthusiastically participated in the anti-hunger, anti-oppression movement from May to June, incurring the hatred of the Chiang family.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 22nd: The Chiang Kai-shek Education Ministry has adopted despicable means to undermine the student anti-civil war, anti-hunger movement, using disguised expulsions to deal with patriotic students in various schools. According to a United Press Shanghai, July 20th dispatch citing Chinese newspapers: More than a hundred students from Shanghai Datong University have received "forced transfer" notices from the school authorities. Other universities, especially those in Shanghai and Hangzhou, will take the same steps. Although the notices do not include words such as "dismissal" or "expulsion," they are in effect equivalent to expulsion, as students forced to withdraw will have difficulty transferring to other schools. It is reported that the Chiang Kai-shek Education Ministry has ordered all schools to refuse to accept students from other schools who have been forced to withdraw.

　　蒋介石无法阻遏学潮竟下令封闭交通大学
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】塔斯社上海二十五日电引沪报讯：蒋介石已下令封闭上海国立交通大学；蒋记教育部已接获训令办理。据称：当局（指蒋政府）认为有较其他学校更多的“不肖之徒”。按：交大全体学生曾于五月至六月热烈参加反饥饿反压迫运动，遭蒋家之憎恨。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】蒋记教育部为破坏学生反内战、反饥饿运动，已采取卑鄙手段，以变相开除来对付各校爱国学生。据合众社上海二十日电引中文报纸消息：沪大同大学已有百余学生，接到学校当局“强迫转学”的通知。其他大学特别是沪杭各校均将采取同样步骤。通知上虽未列有“黜退”或“开除”等字句，但实际上等于开除。因被迫退学学生转学他校时将有困难。据悉：蒋记教育部已勒令各校拒绝收容被迫退学之别校学生。
