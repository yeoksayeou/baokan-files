　　Taigu Pingchuan Develops Explosives Experience
    Wang Xianwen
    Since the beginning of this year, the explosive warfare in Taigu Pingchuan has been extensively carried out. A total of ××× landmines have been detonated, killing and wounding 450 enemy and puppet troops, as confirmed. During the summer harvest struggle alone, 87 landmines were detonated in half a month, killing and wounding 128 enemy and puppet troops below the rank of battalion commander, more than double the number of enemy and puppet troops killed by rifles (rifles killed 40 enemies and wounded 21, totaling 61). The development of this movement has the following experiences:
    1. Establish training classes to improve explosive techniques.
    In order to carry out the explosive warfare for the protection of wheat struggle, the county government held an explosive training class in early April, drawing a group of enthusiastic landmine planters, experienced militiamen in explosives and a group of new militiamen who had not planted landmines to participate in the training. The training method generally adopted was mutual teaching and learning, mutual exchange of experiences, improvement of explosive technology research, and creation of new methods of landmine planting in Pingchuan. After the training, although the technology has improved a step further, most comrades still have the idea that landmines cannot be planted in Pingchuan and that they cannot be disguised well enough to blow up the enemy.
    2. Use practical examples to break through the masses' erroneous idea of underestimating landmines.
    In order to break the masses' incorrect view of underestimating landmines, the leadership consciously went deep into the Wang Bingwu explosives team, planning to severely attack the enemy and create typical examples to influence everyone. For this reason, the comrades of the Bingwu explosives team were asked to make contributions to the people and fire the first shot, striving for the title of county model. Encouraged by this slogan, the explosives handlers bravely headed towards the surroundings of Gezitou Village on the afternoon of May 19 to lay landmines. Coincidentally, on that evening, more than 20 enemies (Revenge Team) stationed in Rencun Village sneaked into our Gezitou Village, pulled a donkey into the village, and robbed a lot of things. They were walking back triumphantly, but after leaving the village, they stepped onto another path, trying to do evil elsewhere. Before long, the black calling mine pressed by Bingwu roared in anger. With the roar, red light rose everywhere, and at this time, an enemy fell to the ground and did not move. This strike made the enemy dare not act arbitrarily, so they had to use two others to support the wounded colored sign and run back on the same road. He did not expect that landmines would be everywhere, so after running a few steps, with a boom, three enemies were blown up as if red flowers had bloomed, their skin broken and bleeding, lying on the ground motionless. The uninjured enemies dared not pass on the road, so they turned and walked around from the field on the side, but the landmine in the field also rang. The enemies watched helplessly as another one was knocked down. At this time, the enemies were dizzy and frightened. They did not even bother to take the donkey, the stolen goods, a rifle dropped by the wounded, and many bullets and bombs. All the enemies had to become stretcher teams, carrying the wounded all the way back to Rencun like wounded dogs. This battle broke through everyone's idea that landmines could not be planted in Pingchuan, and at the same time made the masses realize the power and role of landmines.
    3. The leadership should seize typical examples to promote the general.
    After the Bingwu explosives team created the Gezitou explosives battle and obtained weapons, the county headquarters quickly issued a notice of commendation, and the good news spread throughout the county in a day or two. This battle indeed fired the signal for the wheat protection struggle, and at the same time encouraged the confidence of the explosives handlers in planting landmines.
    Following the commendation notice of the Bingwu explosives team, the county armed forces issued a call to all county militiamen to be bold, brave, mobile, flexible, tenacious, and hard-working to make contributions to the people and carry out the wheat protection struggle movement. At the same time, it was also proposed that strong and conscious militiamen should participate in the explosives movement and catch up with the Bingwu explosives team. After this call was made, militiamen from various places responded one after another, and each explosives team consciously formulated plans for explosives and killing enemies, laying the foundation for carrying out the explosives movement.
     4. Turn dead mines into live mines and effectively strike the enemy.
    (1) To grasp the enemy's activity patterns and flexibly set up mines.
    The Wangcun and Baiyan area was designated by the enemy in Shangzhuang as a "sudden requisition area" for robbing wheat, so the enemy had to come several times a day. Under the influence of the Bingwu explosives battle, the explosives teams in Wangcun and Baiyan were also actively studying new ways to plant landmines to kill enemies and protect the wheat harvest every day. They first studied that when the enemy came out, they would mostly pass through × village first and then to Baiyan. Once they entered the village, they would go in and out of the east and west homes like hungry dogs. So, early on the 24th, they buried landmines on the road from × village to Baiyan, and then went to each house in × village to plant mines. Hanging mines were planted on closed doors, and stepping mines were planted at the bottom of open doorways. On this day, the enemy still walked into the main street of × village as usual. At this time, the bombers were waiting outside the village for the sound of the landmines. Before long, a loud explosion sounded in the east of the village, followed by another explosion in the west. Landmine explosions sounded everywhere in the village. At this time, only the wounded enemies were heard screaming. The enemies felt that there was no hope in × village, so they went to Baiyan again, first walking on the main road. The landmines on the main road were exploding, making the enemies afraid to take the main road, so they took the small road again. The small road was also exploding. Each explosion would kill or wound at least one or two enemies. This day, they were unable to move an inch and had to return after taking four roads.
    (2) Study the enemy's psychology and use various tricks to kill and injure the enemy.
    On May 25, the Baiyan militiamen studied a clever method of planting landmines together, and experimented on the second day. They carried a mud statue of a god in the village to the main road, put a landmine under the statue's buttocks, and pasted slogans on the statue cursing the enemy. Coincidentally, the enemy was passing by Wangcun. Seeing the slogans, they angrily kicked the mud statue down with their feet. The landmine under the buttocks exploded together, killing two enemies. The rest ran back without bothering to pull the dead bodies. The explosives teams estimated that the enemy would definitely come to pull the corpses, so they put a few more landmines under the two dead bodies. Sure enough, when the enemy came to pick up the corpses the next day, they added two more corpses.
    Explosives hero Cao Shengwa was also good at figuring out the enemy's intentions. On the morning of June 19, when more than 500 enemies from Taigu City invaded my Hujiazhuang, Shengwa estimated that the enemy would rest after walking a certain distance, so he placed a large landmine under a large tree beside the road where the enemy often went back and forth to rest. When the enemy came over, a riding battalion commander did indeed take advantage of the coolness under that tree, but as soon as he passed, he and his horse were blown down and injured.
    (3) The combination of explosives and sniping is the most effective way to kill the enemy.
    Explosives movement flag-bearer Comrade Cao Shengwa was even more careful in studying the enemy's actions. He estimated that the enemy would definitely invade Hujiazhuang, the village where my militia working team was stationed. So he placed a sentry mine in Nanzhang Village, ten miles away from Hujiazhuang. On June 19, more than 500 enemies attempted to surround my station, but before they could approach, they were frightened by the sentry mine in Nanzhang Village and dared not go any further, so they had to return.
    Shengwa was not paralyzed at all. He still set up a heavy minefield to protect the station and waited for the enemy to retaliate. On the 24th, more than 700 enemies came to retaliate. The enemy charged six times in a row. The landmines were like combatants, blowing the enemy down when they charged up. Relying on the landmine blockade, my militia working team finally made the enemy afraid to charge up any more. The injured and disappointed enemy had to return.
    At this time, Shengwa militia working team had turned from the enemy's side and rear to Jingshen Village and set up a minefield. They also ambushed near the minefield. When the enemy returned to Jingshen, they all scurried into the minefield, but the mines did not explode. At this time, Shengwa became anxious and ordered the comrades of the militia team to fire a wild shot. The enemy immediately panicked, and then the nine minefields exploded in a group. Immediately, cold shots were fired from all sides. At this time, the enemy ran away regardless of everything. In this battle, six enemies were killed and ten were wounded by the explosions, and three were killed and four were wounded by the cold shots.
    (4) Use maze formations to confuse the enemy and make them dare not act arbitrarily.
    Killing hero Comrade Jia Maohou heard the news on July 1 that the enemy was invading Fancun. He immediately placed mines all over the main street entrances and alleys and on the doors of each house, and also drew circles everywhere, realistically and unrealistically, to warn the enemy to be careful of landmines. When the enemy came, they were indeed frightened. After entering the village, they dared not enter the open doors, and even less dared to enter the closed doors, so they had to retreat, and Fancun suffered no loss at all.

　　太谷平川开展爆炸经验
    王献文
    今年以来太谷平川的爆炸战已大量开展，共爆炸地雷×××颗，毙伤敌伪据已查明者四百五十人，只在夏收斗争中，半个月内爆炸地雷即达八十七个，死伤敌伪营长以下一百二十八人，超过了步枪杀伤敌伪数的一倍以上（步枪打死敌四十人、打伤二十一人、共六十一人）。这一运动的开展有以下几点经验：
    一、创办训练班提高爆炸技术。
    为开展保麦斗争的爆炸战，县府于四月初即举办了爆炸训练班，抽调了一批热心埋雷和有爆炸经验的民兵与一批未埋过地雷的新民兵来参加训练。训练的方式，一般是采取互教互学互相交流经验，提高改进爆炸技术研究，创造平川埋雷新的方法。经训练后，虽在技术上提高了一步，但大部同志在思想上仍然存在着以为平川不能埋雷，伪装不好炸不了敌人的想法。
    二、用实际范例打通群众轻视地雷的错误思想。
    领导上为打破群众轻视地雷的不正确观点，所以就有意识的深入了王炳五爆炸队，计划痛击敌人创造典型范例，来影响大家。为此即向炳五爆炸队同志提出要为民立功打头炮，争取全县模范的口号。在这一口号的鼓舞下，爆炸手们就于五月十九日下午勇敢的挺向格子头村周围去埋设地雷，可巧当日黄昏，驻任村之敌（复仇队）二十余人偷偷摸到我格子头村来，进村拉了一头毛驴，抢了好多东西，正在得意洋洋的往回走，但出村后，他们却踏上了另一条小路去，企图又到别处去做恶，不大一会，只听的炳五按下的黑叫雷在怒吼，随着吼声，红光四起，这时一个敌人就倒在地上不动了。这一下打的敌人不敢任意行动，只得用另两个去扶着负伤彩号往来路上跑，他没想到地雷是到处都会有的，于是跑了不几步，轰的又一声，将三个敌人炸得好象开了红花一样皮破血流，躺在地上不动了。未伤的敌人不敢朝着路上过，就转身从侧面的地里绕着走，可是地里的雷也响了，敌人眼巴巴的看着又被打倒了一个，这时打的敌人昏头昏脑，恐惧起来，赶上的毛驴抢下的东西什么也都丢下，连伤号们掉下的一枝步枪，还有好多子弹炸弹也都顾不得拿，所有的敌人只好都变成了担架队，抬上伤号好象受伤的狗一样一直跑回了任村。这一战打通了大家以为平川不能埋雷的思想，同时也使群众认识了地雷的威力与作用。
    三、领导上要抓取典型推动一般。
    炳五爆炸队创造了格子头爆炸战获得武器范例后，县指挥部就急速通令嘉奖，一两天捷报即传遍了全县。这一战，果然打响了保麦斗争的信号，同时也鼓舞了爆炸手们埋雷的信心。
    县武随着嘉奖炳五爆炸队的通令，即提出了号召全县民兵要胆大勇敢机动灵活坚苦顽强为民立功，来开展保麦斗争运动。同时又提出了坚强觉悟的民兵，要参加爆炸运动，迎头赶上炳五爆炸队，这一号召提出后，各地民兵即纷纷响应，各个爆炸队也自觉的自订爆炸杀敌计划，奠定了开展爆炸运动的基础。
     四、把死雷变为活雷，有效的打击敌人。
    （一）要掌握敌人活动规律，灵活的设雷。
    王村、白燕这块地方，是上庄敌人所确定为抢麦“突征区”，因此敌人每天都要来几次。王村、白燕的爆炸队在炳五爆炸战的影响下，他们也每天都在积极地研究埋雷杀敌保卫麦收的新办法，他们首先研究出敌人出来时多是先经×村后到白燕，一入村就象饿狗一样东家里出来西家门进去，于是他们就在二十四日早早地将×村到白燕的去路上埋好了地雷，又到×村各家门上按雷，闭着大门的给按上了挂雷，大开门子的将门道底按上了踏雷，敌人这天仍与往常日同样地大摇大摆走进了×村的大街，这时炸手们都在村外等待着地雷的叫声，不大一会，果然村东面轰的一声响了一颗，接着西边又响了一颗，村里的雷声四起，这时只听的被打伤的敌人在乱叫，敌人觉的×村没啥指望了，就又到白燕去，先是从大路上走，大路上的地雷在响，炸的敌人不敢走大路，又从小路上过，小路也在响，每响一颗，敌人至少也要有一两个死伤，这一天炸的他寸步难行，只好走了四条路返回去了。
    （二）要研究捉摸敌人的心理，利用各种巧计去杀伤敌人。
    白燕民兵于五月二十五日在一块研究出埋雷的巧法，赶第二日就做实验，他们把村里一个泥神像抬在大路上，把神像屁股下按上了雷，并将泥神的身上又贴上了怒骂敌人的标语，可巧敌人正从王村过来了，一看标语就发怒地将泥神猛的用脚踏倒，随着屁股下的地雷就齐响了，炸死两个敌人，其余的顾不上拉死尸就跑回去了。爆炸队们估计到敌人一定还要来拉尸体，所以就把两个死尸下又按了几颗雷，果然第二日敌人来起死尸时，却又添加了两条死尸。
    爆炸英雄曹生娃同志也会捉摸敌人的心意，在六月十九日上午，太谷城之敌五百余向我胡家庄进犯时，生娃估计到敌走够一段路就会休息，所以他将敌人来回常去休息之地的路旁大树下按了一颗大地雷，敌人过来时，一个骑马的营长果真到那棵树下趁凉，但一过去，就连人带马全被炸倒负伤了。
    （三）爆炸和冷枪结合，是杀敌最有效之办法。
    爆炸运动旗帜曹生娃同志，更能细心专研敌人的行动规律，他估计到敌人定会进犯我民兵武工队驻的村胡家庄，于是他就把离胡家庄十里路的南张村按上了哨雷，六月十九日，敌五百余企图包围我驻地，但没等他接近就被南张村的哨雷炸的吓住不敢再走了，只好返回去。
    生娃却一点也不麻痹，仍然把掩护驻地的雷阵重重摆好等待敌人来报复。二十四日敌七百余报复来了，敌人连冲六次，地雷好象战斗员一样，敌冲上来再把他炸下去，我民兵武工队依靠地雷的封锁，终于把敌炸的再也不敢往上冲了，受伤失望的敌人只好往回返。
    这时生娃民兵武工队已从敌侧后转向井神村摆好了雷阵，他们又从雷阵附近埋伏起来，敌返回来到了井神时，一个个都窜进雷阵去，但雷也不响，这时生娃发急了，就命令民兵队同志打了个荒子枪，敌马上就慌乱起来，紧接着九颗雷阵就响成了一团，随即四面冷枪击去，这时打的敌人不顾一切的逃走了。这一战炸死了敌人六个，炸伤十个，冷枪打死三个，打伤四个。
    （四）利用迷阵迷惑敌人，使敌不敢任意行动。
    杀敌英雄贾毛猴同志七月一日听到敌向范村进犯的消息，当即将大路口大街小巷与各家门上都花花地按好了雷，并又虚虚实实的到处画上了叫敌人小心地雷的圈圈，敌人来时果然被吓住了，进村后，开门的不敢进，关门的更不敢进，只好退走，范村丝毫未受损失。
