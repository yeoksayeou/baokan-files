　　US Economic Crisis Looms
  　Truman Anxiously Places Hope on Foreign Expansion
  　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 25th: Washington dispatch: Truman presented a lengthy mid-year economic report to Congress on the 21st, putting on an optimistic show of the current economic situation in the United States in order to reassure people; however, he revealed his anxiety and unease about the looming economic crisis. While boasting about America's "high production," he had to warn that the current situation "is the result of certain temporary demands in the American economic system (note: this refers to the purchasing power accumulated in the United States during the war), and economic stability cannot be achieved once this demand decreases." In fact, the shrinking of the domestic market and the sharp decline in people's purchasing power in the United States have already begun, and Truman dared not conceal it. He said: "We will face a lack of purchasing power at the end of this year." So he cried out: "Prices must still be reduced in order to recover sales and stimulate production." Truman's report did not mention the nearly six million unemployed, but boasted greatly about achieving so-called "full employment for 60 million people," but then contradicted himself by saying: "Labor demand seems to be weakening, especially in the textile, clothing, wool, and electrical industries." "Moreover, the number of unemployed in June has increased, and the government is now studying ways to compensate for it." The current poor economic situation in the United States forces Truman to pin all his hopes on the magic weapon of foreign expansion. In his report, Truman actually wrote "foreign aid" as "the main issue of American foreign policy."

　　美国经济危机迫近
  　杜鲁门焦灼不安
  　只好把希望放在对外扩张上
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】华盛顿讯：杜鲁门于二十一日向国会提出了长篇的年中经济报告，对美国目前经济情况故作乐观之叙述，借以安定人心；但却显出了马脚，透露了对日益迫近的经济危机的焦灼与殷蔓。他一面夸耀美国之“高度生产”，一面不得不提出警告称：目前之情况“系美国经济制度中某些临时要求之结果（按：这是指战时美国国内所积累下来的购买力而言），一旦此项需求减退，即不能达成经济之稳定。”事实上美国国内市场的缩小与人民购买力的急剧下降已经开始，杜鲁门亦不敢隐讳。他说：“我们在本年年终当面临购买力缺乏之局面。”于是他大声疾呼：“仍须减低物价，以便换回销路与刺激生产。”杜鲁门报告对近六百万人的失业只字未提，竟大事吹嘘其达到所谓“六千万人充分就业”，但又自相矛盾的说：“劳动需要似有萎弱现象，特别在纺织、服装、羊毛及电汽工业方面。”“而且，六月份失业人数已有增加，政府现正研究弥补之策。”目前美国国内恶劣的经济情况，迫使杜鲁门只好把一切希望压在对外扩张的一宝上了。杜鲁门在其报告中。竟把“对外援助”写成“为美国外交政策之主要问题。”
