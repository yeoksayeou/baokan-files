　　Weijiazhuang Creates New Methods
　　Solving the Problem of Labor Exchange for Remote, Scattered, and Poor Land
　　[Report from this newspaper in Lucheng] After Weijiazhuang filled in the gaps and made things even, especially with the current labor shortage, the masses are unwilling to farm remote, scattered, and poor land. Because the standard yield and burden are the same as for land closer to the village, but it requires significantly more wasted labor, yields are low, and wages are not high. The masses say: "It's better not to plant and earn wages instead!" If it were to be sold today, a mu of land near the village could sell for two dan of rice, but remote land would be given away for free. In providing assistance to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs (抗属) and in labor exchange among mutual aid teams, there is also a serious contradiction between remote, scattered land and well-shaped land near the village. Regarding assistance to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs: the whole village has a total of twenty-seven such households, with five hundred and twenty mu of land. Besides what they farm themselves, the remaining land is divided among all the village's labor force, with each laborer averaging four and a half mu. However, the wasted labor differs. For example, Wei Lianzhu and Wei Renhai spent six workdays repairing four and a half mu of well-shaped land near the village this spring, while Wei Hulin and Ma Lishan spent thirty workdays transporting soil for repairing four and a half mu of remote, scattered land this spring. They reflected: "If we waste labor like this, plus being assigned to various duties, we won't have time to farm our own land." Regarding labor exchange in mutual aid teams: This spring, the regulation for plowing was eight sheng of rice per mu. Wei Gengqun used two animals to plow land near the village for Wei Guohai, plowing five mu in one day and earning four dou of rice without much strain on the people or animals. However, Wei Changsheng used two animals to plow land in Da'ao (five li from the village) and only plowed three mu in one day, earning two dou and four sheng of rice, with great strain on the people and animals. Due to these problems, serious obstacles have been created for supporting revolutionary families and labor exchange. Labor hero Wei Yuanxing discussed the matter with all the village cadres and, after painstaking research, created three major solutions: (1) Lower the standard yield for remote, scattered, and poor land: For example, if it was originally one dan, now it is lowered to eight or seven dou. The evaluation of yields will begin after the summer harvest, combined with planting, and will be appropriately determined by the evaluators. This takes care of the extra labor required for those farming remote and scattered land, dispelling the thought of abandoning it, and truly ensuring that not a single mu of land is left uncultivated. (2) The problem of land cultivated for families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs: Divide based on the land, and allocate based on chance. That is, based on the distance and whether the land is scattered or well-shaped, accurately calculate the total labor required for each season throughout the year, from spring plowing to autumn harvest. Let everyone evaluate this, convert the labor into points (one workday equals ten points), and then divide it according to the human and animal power of the entire village, instead of dividing it based on the number of mu. This is much fairer. (3) The problem of labor exchange among mutual aid teams: Set work quotas flexibly according to the specific task. For example, if it takes two days to plow six mu of scattered, remote land, then set three mu as one workday. If four mu of well-shaped land near the village can be plowed in one day, then set four mu as one workday. Similarly, for weeding seedlings, if the seedlings are dense and require more labor, then set a higher quota; if the seedlings are sparse and require less labor, then set a lower quota. In short, quotas should be flexibly set based on the various specific tasks in each season. Pre-set fixed workday quotas, but be flexible in the actual work. For example, if four mu of land are assigned and it is estimated that it should take five workdays to weed it, if you work hard and complete it in four workdays, the saved labor is your own. However, if it takes seven days to weed it, it will still only count as five workdays. This can fully mobilize initiative and prevent laziness. (Wen Hui, Zeng Lu)

　　魏家庄创造新办法
  　解决远零坏地变工问题
    【本报潞城讯】魏家庄在填平补齐后，尤其在今天劳力缺乏的情况下，群众都不愿意种远地，零碎坏地。因为和近地一样标准产量，一样负担，但特别多误工，产量不大，工资不少。群众说：“不如不种，去赚工资合算”！今天要拿出来卖，如果岭前（离村近）地一亩地能卖两石米，岭后地白给也没人要。在给抗属代耕与互助组变工中，也严重的存在着远零地与近整地的矛盾。代耕上：全村共抗干属二十七户，地五百二十亩，除自耕一部分外，其余的地，按全村劳力分担，每个劳力平均四亩五分，但误工不一样，例如：魏连柱、魏仁海代耕四亩五分近整地，今春修地用了六个工，而魏虎林、马立山代耕四亩五分远零地，今春修地担土用了三十个工，反映说：“象咱这样误工，加上支差等勤务，自己地就不用种了。”在互助组变工上：如今春犁地，规定是犁一亩地八升米，魏根群两个牲口给魏郭孩犁家边地，一天犁了五亩，赚米四斗，人畜没受大累，而魏常胜两个牲口给魏吞则犁大凹地（离村五里），一天只犁了三亩，赚米二斗四升，人畜受了很大累。由于上述这些问题，造成优抗、变工上的严重障碍，劳动英雄魏元杏就和全村干部讨论，经苦心研究，创造出三大解决办法：（一）降低远零坏地标准产量：比如原来是一石，现在降为八斗或七斗。夏收后结合种地，评议产量就开始实行，由评议员适当评订。这样照顾种远零地户的多误工，打消抛弃不种思想，真正做到不荒一亩地。（二）抗属代耕地问题：按地折分，分碰分。就是按地的远近、零整，从春耕到秋耕，精确计算全年各季节用多少工，由大家评定，把工折成分（一工十分），再按全村人、畜体力分来分，不是按亩数来分，这样就公平的多了。（三）互助组变工地问题：按具体活灵活订工，如犁地，零碎远地六亩须二天，就订三亩地为一工，近整地一天能犁四亩，就定四亩为一工。又如锄苗，苗稠误工就多订工，苗稀省工就少订工。总之是根据各个季节，各种具体活，灵活制订。预先订下死工数，在活上是灵活的，比如：有四亩地，订五个工锄完，你努力四个工完成，节省了工是自己的，但如果七天才锄完也只顶五个工，这样能充分发挥积极性，防止偷懒。（文辉、增禄）
