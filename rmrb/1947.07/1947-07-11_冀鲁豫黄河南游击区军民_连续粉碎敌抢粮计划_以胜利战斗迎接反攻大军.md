[This dispatch from our newspaper's Jilu豫 bureau on the 9th] Before the great counter-offensive of our army, the armymen and civilians in the enemy's rear guerrilla area of southern Henan bravely fought in the first and middle ten days of June to crush the Chiang army's grain-grabbing "encirclement and suppression" plan and prepare favorable combat conditions for the southbound army.

On the morning of June 18, more than 200 remnants of the enemy's 72nd Division in Shiheng, Feicheng, along with more than 200 "Homecoming Corps" from the 4th, 6th, and 7th districts, led by Bao Xing-san, went to Hengyu in the 7th district to plunder. The armed work teams of the 4th and 7th districts of Feicheng and the 4th district of Pingyin discovered this and engaged in a fierce battle for two hours, killing 11 enemies. The enemy fled back to Shiheng in a panic.

The enemy Cao Fu-lin's unit from ＠Shan Xiaopi's mouth, a regiment divided into two groups, each with 200 "Homecoming Corps" members, went to Kongfang and Daimiao near Liangshan to build temporary strongholds and set out to "suppress" and grab grain everywhere. The county committee immediately called on all districts to arm themselves against "suppression" and grain grabbing. In eight days, the militia and local armed forces in the entire district fought 34 battles, killing nine enemies, wounding four, killing 17 "Homecoming Corps" members, and wounding five. On the 18th, the county committee assembled 400 militiamen and cooperated with the Yunbei and ＠Shan detachments to ambush at Yangzhuang. When the enemy arrived, they killed many enemies in less than ten minutes. The enemy desperately transported the wounded in two large trucks and fled in a panic. Afterwards, they desperately grabbed laborers to repair strongholds and squatted inside, daring not to show their faces again.

On June 17, the entire 139th Brigade of the enemy's 70th Division in Henan Province mobilized and launched a frantic "encirclement and suppression" and "mopping-up" operation in the Feng (County), Dang (Shan), and Shan (County) areas. They also set up temporary strongholds in Dayangzhuang, Chaipang, Liuguangji, Zhouzhai, and other places to "suppress," grab grain, and destroy tunnels, adopting a three-all policy and burning and plundering more than 30 villages such as Wangzhuang. The armymen and civilians in the area hated it to the extreme. On the 13th, they retaliated against the enemy, killing and wounding more than 100 enemies and capturing more than 100. When a small group of more than 30 enemies advanced to Caitang District of Huadang County to grab grain, Comrade Li Yannan, the instructor of the district, gathered the militia and messengers from Mengji and went to Caitang to block the enemy. Comrade Yannan fired a shot and shouted: "Surrender and you will not be killed!" The enemy raised their hands in panic. In this battle, 25 people, including the chief of secret service and clerks, were captured, and three rifles and more than a dozen rows of bullets were seized.

On June 20, Wei Zhenjiang, the captain of the Nanshanzhen detachment of the enemy's 6th District of Changyuan, and more than 30 others went to the Lugangdian area of ​​our 6th District to grab grain and conscript soldiers. Our county detachment and 6th District team resolutely defended the interests of the masses and bravely attacked them. They killed 11 enemies north of Nanshaji, captured 18, and seized more than 20 rifles and some bullets. Only three enemies survived. On the 20th, three pseudo-town teams from Shangzhong Kongzhen, together with a company of Chiang's 560th Regiment, about 400 to 500 people, went to Gaoping, the southern part of our Changyuan 7th District and Hua County 7th District, to grab grain. Upon hearing the news, our district team and militia guerrillas launched sparrow warfare against the enemy in three routes. After a fierce battle for about two hours, the enemy was unable to support and fled south in a panic. We recovered a cart and a mule and a donkey grabbed by the enemy and returned them to the masses.

On June 8, more than 2,000 remnants of the enemy's 72nd Division in Wenshang invaded the west. On the 10th, they occupied the Mufang area in the south of Dafeitun District and carried out "mopping-up" and "suppression". Our militia guerrillas flexibly and vigilantly attacked the enemy day and night. On the 12th, they ambushed the enemy in Jiangzhuang and intercepted an enemy transport vehicle going to Wenkou. On the 13th, they ambushed in Zhuanshe and intercepted 30 enemy carts loaded with ammunition.

On the 14th, the enemies from the stronghold near ＠Shan, carrying heavy machine guns, divided into three groups and went north along the river embankment in an attempt to "encircle and suppress" Yangdaizhuang and grab grain. Our militia guerrillas set an ambush. When the enemy entered our ambush circle, we concentrated our forces and launched an attack. After an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy was wounded or killed more than 20 people.

On the 13th, more than 30 members of the pseudo-Linyi brigade who had invaded from Qiyu attempted to grab grain in the Dafuying area. Our "White Light" unit quickly rushed to Zhengzhuang, holding back the enemy's rear. After an hour of fighting, three enemies were captured, six rifles and 350 bullets were seized. During the pursuit, one enemy was killed and two were wounded.

On the 20th, more than 30 members of the pseudo-Qihe brigade Zheng Kexue's unit attempted to grab wheat in Benlizhuang. Our "White Light" unit ambushed. After the enemy entered our ambush circle, we used the tiger pouncing tactic and a burst of grenades ended the battle. In this battle, one enemy squad leader and one soldier were killed, three were wounded, and ten people, including Wang Jinsheng, the secret service captain sent by the 98th Army, and Wang Xiu, the telegraph operator, were captured, and eleven rifles and hundreds of bullets were seized.

On the 13th, the main battalion of Chiang's 70th Division and a part of the local bandits went to the Weimiao and Wang Xiaozhuang line in Huxi to grab grain. We crushed the 278th Regiment headquarters and its 3rd Battalion in one fell swoop. In addition to killing or wounding more than 50 enemies, we also captured more than 60 alive and seized more than 20 Type 99 rifles.

[This dispatch from our newspaper's Jilu豫 bureau on the 9th] Qi Bin militia hero Jiang Hongfei laid a minefield to attack the Chiang army who were grabbing grain. The 5th Prefectural Committee issued a circular to commend him. On June 4, about 200 Chiang's regular troops and local bandits invaded Caoji and went to the Caowangdian area to grab grain and arrest people. Our Qi Bin militia hero Jiang Hongfei and four others ambushed the enemy on the way, seriously wounding three enemies. When the enemy retaliated with fierce artillery fire, the heroes had already circled to the highway east of Wangdian North Lizhuang on the Jiang army's return route and laid a minefield, disguised with straw paper figures and writing "Born in the South, died in the North." "Dying for Old Chiang is a wrong death! Whoever dares to plunder, f*** his mother!" The enemy was extremely angry when they saw it and went to pull out the straw figures. The mines exploded, and the platoon leader and two soldiers were seriously injured. The enemy dared not pull them out again and had to slip away from the side.
