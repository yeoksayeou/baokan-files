Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, July 21st: Remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's troops and local gangs in Southern Liaoning, facing a dead end, are disintegrating rapidly. In recent days, more than two hundred have surrendered to the democratic government. Wang Bingnan, the former captain of Chiang's "剿匪队" (bandit suppression team), personally led twenty-five members, carrying weapons, to surrender. Zhang Jinbo, the Chiang-appointed town head of Gushan County, and Yu Tianju, the head of the self-defense force, also led twenty-two remnants to surrender voluntarily. In addition, ninety-eight members of the Kuomintang Advancement Association and former police officers from the same county voluntarily expressed repentance to the democratic government.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, July 20th: Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Qingdao are weary of war, and armed desertions have occurred. According to the Qingdao Times on June 27th, eight soldiers from a certain unit of Chiang Kai-shek's 54th Army, carrying one light machine gun, one grenade launcher, two submachine guns, three automatic rifles, and four to five hundred rounds of ammunition, collectively sneaked into Laoshan to resist Chiang's tyranny with arms. They were seen operating around Liuqinghe and Chengzi Stone near Laoshan. On June 23rd, a group of two of them encountered troops sent by the 54th Army to pursue them in the foothills of Laoshan. A battle broke out. The two deserters, taking the high ground, used submachine guns to fire fiercely. Two Chiang's soldiers were injured, while they safely transferred.
