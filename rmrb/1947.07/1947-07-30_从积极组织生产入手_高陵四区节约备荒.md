　　Starting with Actively Organizing Production
  　Gaoling Fourth District Conserves and Prepares for Famine
    [This newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu dispatch, 28th] At the village cadre meeting in the Fourth District of Gaoling, they discussed how to produce, conserve, and prepare for famine. Han Jinhe, the Director of the Women's Salvation Association of Baidaokou sub-district, was the first to propose her own conservation method: "My family has three people, and each person eats one liter of wheat per day. I remember the suffering of eating tree bark and peanut skins in the 32nd year of the Republic of China. My family will conserve and prepare for famine in the future, reducing it to half a liter of wheat per person per day. The three of us will eat one and a half liters a day, and make up for the shortfall with vegetables." Under her influence, they then discussed specific methods for production and conservation in the village: (1) Mobilize the masses to actively strive to plant six mu of sweet potatoes per person. In terms of labor, in addition to carrying stretchers and digging tunnels, all men, women, old and young should carry out shock work together. Everyone should freely combine to form "Ruyi Mutual Aid Teams," with work points recorded on a team basis. Production is combined with public service; strong young men should be calculated at ten points per day, and the elderly, young people, and women should be assigned work points as appropriate. Public service, stretchers, digging tunnels, etc., are also counted as work. Livestock on public service should be counted as one and a half to two work points per day, depending on the size and strength of the livestock. Livestock working at home should be counted as one work point per day. Production work points are recorded by the team, and public service work points are recorded by the village secretary; (2) Save and conserve by eating more bran, vegetables, and coarse grains. Each person should save one to two he of grain per day, and it is better to save more. Use wheat to exchange for autumn grain to eat, drink more porridge and eat less steamed buns, and pick up fallen jujubes or collect wild vegetables to dry and save for future consumption. It is also proposed that men quit smoking and drinking, women pay attention to supervision, and leftover food should not be fed to livestock, to ensure that grain is eaten according to plan; (3) Each village should establish a Disaster Preparedness Production and Conservation Committee to be responsible for leading the masses in planting and conserving.

　　从积极组织生产入手
  　高陵四区节约备荒
    【本报冀鲁豫二十八日电】高陵四区村干会上，讨论如何生产节约备荒。白道口小区妇救会主任韩今河首先提出自己的节约办法：“俺家有三口人，每天每人吃一升麦子，我想起民国三十二年吃树皮、花生皮的苦处，我家今后要节约备荒，每人每天减到半升麦子，三人每天吃一升半，不够以菜补足。”在她的影响下，接着讨论村里生产节约具体办法：（一）发动群众积极争取每人种六亩红薯，在力量运用上除抬担架和挖地道外，其余男女老幼一齐进行突击，大家自由结合成立“如意互助组”，以组为单位记工分工，生产与支差结合，青壮年每人每日算十分，老年、幼年、妇女酌情定工分。出差、担架、挖地道等也算工，牲口出差每天算一个半工至两个工，看牲口大小强弱来定，牲口在家作活的每天算一个工。生产工由组内记，出差工由村书记记；（二）俭省节约多吃糠菜和杂粮，每人每日要省下一合到二合粮，能多省更好，用麦换秋粮吃，多喝饭少吃馍，拾落下的小枣或采野菜晒干，留着将来吃。并提出男子戒烟、戒酒，妇女注意监督，剩下饭也不喂牲畜，保证粮食有计划的吃；（三）各村成立备灾生产节约委员会，负责领导群众点种节约。
