　　【Benbao Ji Lu Yu Ershijiu Ri Dian】Guancheng Second District inspected Party members' thoughts, strictly upheld the position of establishing the branch as the core leadership to re-examine the land reform. At the branch joint meeting, after enlightenment, everyone reflected. Zhao Hai Village ×× reflected on his landlord ideology. He said: "The landlord Zhao Wenqing's male relatives ran away, and the female relatives cried and said some nice words to us, and my heart softened. I felt sorry for the landlord and told him to hide things, so the masses couldn't get anything out during the land reform. I became the landlord's air-raid shelter." Some reflected that they had selfish and corrupt thoughts, dividing up more fruits and spending the landlord's money, which affected their lack of seriousness and boldness in fighting the landlord. Then, some comrades reflected that they had middle-peasant thoughts, lacked a strong fighting spirit, and feared the landlord's counterattack and the changing of the times. After the review, the class ideology was clarified, and it was unanimously decided to mobilize the masses to eliminate the landlord class. From landlord Guo Hai's struggle account book, they realized that the landlord was the poor's eternal enemy and a millennia-old foe, breaking the cadres' thoughts of feeling sorry for the landlords. The landlords should be controlled in a long-term, decentralized manner, and everything better than the peasants should be completely exchanged. Changing the past attitude of despising the backward, they realized that if the backward are not thoroughly mobilized, the landlord is the reason for this incompleteness. Then, they studied the leadership problem in the re-examination, determined that the branch was the leadership core. First, they would convene a branch general meeting to examine the thoughts since the land reform, carry out ideological struggle, and then the branch would determine the re-examination plan for the village to consult with the poor peasants, obtain the poor peasants' agreement, and the middle peasants' approval to fully deal with the landlords. The branch committee should concentrate leadership, establish a good meeting system, and frequently report, discuss, and inspect.
    【Benbao Ji Lu Yu Ershijiu Ri Dian】The Anzhuang Branch in Nanle Fifth District inspected the position of Party members and cadres in the mass movement, making the re-examination movement one step deeper. At the beginning, the branch convened a general meeting of all Party members to examine the achievements of the re-examination in the past two months. The branch's leadership in leading the masses to overturn the old order was meritorious, enabling each of the impoverished peasants to obtain three mu and eight fen of land, and to distribute more than 70,000 yuan of floating wealth, while each landlord only retained a little over two mu or three mu of land. From the surface, it seemed that the land reform was almost complete, but in reality, the landlord's land was all good land and nearby land, and the grain harvested per mu by the landlord was more than the grain harvested from two mu by the poor peasant. In other aspects such as houses, livestock, and furniture, the difference with the landlord was even greater. The branch secretary reflected and said: "This time I made a mistake, lending two shi of grain to the landlord who was being struggled against, and exchanged it for a good house to live in. I myself am detached from the masses. I must take the things out and admit my mistake to the masses." Then, the village head also reviewed and said: "My problem is that I am unwilling to exchange houses, but willing to demolish houses, asking the middle peasants to divide them, only thinking about the landlords, thinking that the landlords have less land and must leave some good land. The poor people's pits can never be filled. Once I had something to eat, I forgot the suffering of being a hired laborer for the landlord. This is called forgetting the root. Not only can I not receive merit, but I must also be demerited." From the reflection, each Party member clarified the class boundary. In discussing how to eliminate the landlords, everyone unanimously believed that there would be no landlords if we were here. Economically, a thorough accounting from the beginning should be done to fill the large and small pits, completely isolate and control the landlords, listen to the opinions of the poor peasants, follow the mass line, and the grain borrowed and houses exchanged by the cadres in the past should be handed over to the masses for handling and admit mistakes to the masses. Party members should compete to perform meritorious service in the re-examination. The militia guarantees that not a single landlord will escape. After the meeting, a village-wide cadre and member meeting was immediately convened. The branch secretary, village head, and others first apologized to the masses and returned the extra fruits, gaining the support and understanding of the masses. The meeting proposed using the method of comparing the past with the landlords to thoroughly re-examine. After the meeting, more than eighty poor peasant households exchanged more than two hundred houses and two hundred and seventy mu of land.

　　南乐观城农村支部
  　党员检查思想加强翻身领导
    【本报冀鲁豫二十九日电】观城二区检查党内思想，严正立场确定以支部为核心领导复查。在支部联席会上，经启发后，大家进行反省，赵海村××反省自己地主思想，他说：“地主赵文清男的跑了，女的对咱一哭、说些好话，心就软了，对地主可怜，叫他把东西掩藏起来，所以土地改革时群众弄不出东西，俺当了地主防空洞。”有的反省出有自私贪污思想，多分果实，花地主钱，影响到对地主斗争不认真，不大胆。接着有些同志反省出有中农思想，斗争性不强，怕地主反攻，怕变天。检查后阶级思想明确了，一致确定发动群众消灭地主阶级的方针，从郭海地主的一本斗争帐中，认识了地主是穷人千年对头，万年仇家，打破了干部可怜地主的思想，对地主要长期分散控制，凡比农民好的东西完全调换过来，改变过去对落后轻视的态度，认识到落后发动不彻底，地主即其不彻底。接着又研究了复查中的领导问题，确定支部为领导核心，下去首先召开支部大会，检查土改以来思想，开展思想斗争，然后由支部定出本村复查计划，去和贫农商量，求得贫农同意，中农赞成，全力对付地主，支委会要集中领导，要定好会议制度，经常汇报讨论检查。
    【本报冀鲁豫二十九日电】南乐五区安庄支部检查党员干部在群运中的立场，使复查运动深入一步。开始该支部召开全体党员大会，检查两月来的复查成绩，支部领导全村群众翻身是有功的，使赤贫农每人都得到三亩八分土地，分到了七万元以上的浮财，而地主每人只留有二亩多或三亩地。从表面上看土地改革已经差不多，但实际上地主的地全是好地、近地，地主每亩地所打粮食比贫农二亩地所打的粮食还多。其他如房屋、牲口、家具，比地主差的更远。支部书记反省说：“这次我犯了错误，给被斗地主借了两石粮食，自己换了好房子住，本身脱离群众，我一定把东西拿出来，向群众承认错误。”接着，村长也检讨说：“我的毛病是不愿换房、愿拆房，叫中农分点，光给地主打算，认为地主地少了得留点好地，穷人的坑填不完，自己有了吃的，就忘了从前给地主当雇工时的苦难，这叫忘了本，不但不能记功还得记过。”从反省中每个党员明确了阶级界线。在讨论如何消灭地主时，大家一致认为有咱就无地主，在经济上从头彻底算总帐，把大小坑填平，把地主完全孤立控制起来，听取贫农意见，走群众路线，干部过去借的粮、换的房，即交群众处理，向群众承认错误。复查中党员要竞赛立功。民兵保证地主一个跑不掉。会后立即召开全村干部会员大会，支书村长等，首向群众认错，退出多得果实，得到群众的拥护与谅解，大会上提出用与地主比时光算帐的方法深入复查。大会结束后八十余户贫农换房二百余间。换地二百七十余亩。
