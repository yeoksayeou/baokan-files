Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: A Sui-Xi dispatch: "Of the Yellow River's hundred harms, Hetao alone is rich." This is an ancient Chinese saying. But today, the people of Sui-Xi say, "This 'set' is not as good as that 'set'." Indeed, Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Tso-yi's rule, with their "set" of methods to squeeze the lifeblood of the people, can transform Hetao from prosperity to poverty, a feat of "skillful" ingenuity. Hetao was formerly known as the Northwest Granary, but currently, famine is imminent. In January of this year, millet was priced around 5,000 per *dou*, but by April, it had risen to 25,000, and in mid-May, it reached 50,000, a tenfold jump compared to January, and there were buyers but no sellers. From mid-April onward, starving people gathered in groups of hundreds and thousands, looting grain everywhere. The news spread, shocking all of Suiyuan. Farmers in areas where there was no grain to loot relied on wild bitter herbs as their "life-saving elixir." This disaster is inseparable from the man-made actions of Chiang and Fu. Last year, after Houtao suffered from flooding, Chiang and Fu levied 530,000 *shi* of military grain from this area, collecting more than three or four *dou* per *mu*, and demanding only wheat; farmers sold their land and cattle but still could not pay enough. In areas like Linhe and Yankou, grain requisition personnel detained and tortured debtors; in the harsh winter season, they stripped farmers of their clothes and poured cold water on them. Zhang Laotong, a farmer from Yongxing Township in Linhe, committed suicide by disembowelment out of fear of punishment for owing grain. This year, the Chiang government is again squeezing the purchase of military grain in this area, transporting it eastward in a steady stream via the Ping-Sui Railway, with Fu Tso-yi taking a share of 25 to 40 percent. Chiang and Fu's henchmen also take advantage of the farmers' plight, using public grain taken from the farmers, under the guise of "relief," with one person using several aliases to collect public grain and then loaning it to the farmers at high interest rates. The starving farmers of Hetao have begun to recognize who is causing their hunger, and their anger is accumulating; the grain looting is just a spark.

### 蒋傅吸吮人民脂膏　河套由富变穷

　　蒋傅吸吮人民脂膏
  　河套由富变穷
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】绥西通讯：“黄河百害，惟富一套。”这是中国的古话；但是今天绥西老百姓却说：“这‘一套’不如那‘一套’”，的确，蒋介石、傅作义的统治，其吸吮人民脂膏的“一套”，能改变河套的富庶为贫穷，可谓“巧”夺天工。河套旧称西北米仓，但是目前粮荒已岌岌不可终日。今年一月小米每斗价约五千左右，到四月便涨达二万五，五月中旬更达五万，较一月间米价跳跃十倍，而且有行无市。从四月中旬起，各地饥民千百成群，到处抢粮，风声所播，全绥震惊。无粮可抢之区的农民，便靠野地的苦菜作“救命丹”。灾荒是与蒋、傅的人工制造不可分的。去年当后套遭受水灾之后，蒋傅却在此地区勒征军粮五十三万石，每亩征收三、四斗以上，且限收小麦；农民卖地卖牛尚交纳不足。临河、晏口一带，征粮人员关押欠户，酷刑拷打；在严冬时节剥去农民衣服，灌以冷水；临河永兴乡农民张老同即以欠粮畏刑而剖腹自尽。今年蒋政府复在此地榨买军粮，由平绥路源源东运，傅作义则分享其二成半到四成。蒋、傅瓜牙复乘农民之危，以取自农民的库存公粮，名曰“胀灾”，一人化名若干，领出公粮，而以高利贷予农民。饥饿的河套农民已开始认清是谁使他们饥饿的，他们的愤怒正在积累着，抢粮风潮不过星星之火罢了。
