    Snippets from the Chiang Kai-shek Controlled Areas
    ▲ Due to the extreme consumption of soldiers in the civil war, the Chiang government is even conscripting lawyers to be cannon fodder. According to a Central News Agency dispatch on June 17th: "Lawyer associations in various places have repeatedly appealed to the Chiang Kai-shek Defense Ministry's conscription bureau, requesting a postponement of conscription." However, this was rejected by the conscription bureau.
    ▲ Liu, a coolie at the cattle and horse farm in Kaiyuan, Liaobei (recently recovered by the Democratic Allied Army), supported a family of five. Since mid-April, Liu was conscripted by the Chiang army for forced labor, causing his entire family to starve. In May, he was conscripted again, leading Liu to hang himself in despair.
    ▲ Hong Zhao-bo, a worker at Tsinghua University in Beiping, and his family of six, only earn 5,000 yuan in wages per day, which is not enough to cover household expenses. On June 5th, he hanged himself in the campus woods.
    ▲ According to recent statistics released by the Shanghai Police Bureau: In Shanghai, a total of 32 citizens committed suicide in April due to livelihood difficulties, unemployment, and job failures.
    ▲ In Tianjin, more and more poor people are taking risks due to livelihood pressures. The number of prisoners in a certain detention center in the city has recently increased more than twofold, reaching over 1,300 by the beginning of last month.
    ▲ Recently, in the suburban area of Shashi, Hubei, more than ten people opened fire and robbed a riverboat.
    ▲ In mid-May, an armed civilian uprising of more than thirty people attacked Jiangzhen, a suburb of Shanghai, and safely withdrew after a fierce battle with the defending troops.
