The Light of the Peasants
　　In Memory of Comrade Gao Yunxing, a Hero of Liberation in the Border Areas
　　Luo Fu
　　As we pick up our pens to write about Gao Yunxing, a sturdy, strong, dark face, a simple yet robust figure appears before my eyes. This people's hero mobilized the masses in the border areas and heroically sacrificed himself in the battle against the Kuomintang "Homecoming Legion" that besieged Gaoyi Hetou Village.
　　Comrade Gao Yunxing was from Cejing, Shahe. He was an excellent Communist Party member, the chairman of the Cejing farmers' association, and an old farmer of forty-five years. In the old society, he worked as a hired laborer for half his life and remained a bachelor for half his life. Only after the Eighth Route Army liberated Cejing did he turn over, acquire a house, and own land. Last July, he married a wife. On the very day he held his wedding, before he could even consummate the marriage, he received a notice in the afternoon: the higher authorities were transferring him to work in the "Turning Over" Team, and he was to assemble in the city that very day. Gao Yunxing thought, "I've already married my wife, she's not going anywhere. But the work of turning over cannot be delayed!" He packed his luggage and left home.
　　The next day, he arrived at the Lincheng District "Turning Over" Team for training. The story of Old Gao joining the "Turning Over" Team before even entering his bridal chamber spread like a myth throughout the team, moving many backward elements who were unwilling to leave their hometowns or their wives. The leadership seized upon this typical example, published it in the newspaper as a commendation, and provided a great education to the cadres undergoing training. After half a month of training, Old Gao was transferred to Gaoyi New District, Hetou Village, to assist in the work of turning over. That village was not far from Yuanshi City, and the masses had a serious "changing heavens" mentality; most were afraid to approach the "Turning Over" Team. Old Gao went to the fields to help the villagers with their work, chatting with them, inquiring about their sufferings, and organizing them to speak out about their grievances. He always used his own personal experiences to persuade the masses: "I used to organize farmers' associations in the village. The enemy's Thirteenth Detachment of the People's Army caused trouble everywhere. We couldn't hold meetings in the village, and we even had to go to the mountains at night to hold meetings. Today, we have the protection of the front-line troops, and the government is supporting us. If we still don't work hard, how can we be worthy of Chairman Mao...?"
　　Old Gao's work style was lively and thorough, meticulous and patient. He never put on airs, always laughing and joking. The farmers liked to approach him, especially the young farmers, who affectionately nicknamed him "Old Youth."

　　On the night of November 12th, Hetou Village was surrounded by the Yuanshi "Homecoming Legion." More than two hundred enemies, armed with three machine guns and two grenade launchers, attempted to capture the comrades of the "Turning Over" Team alive and destroy our village government. At that time, the Hetou militia had only two Hubei-made large rifles, eighty bullets, and twenty-eight hand grenades. But when the enemy's machine guns opened fire, Old Gao and Li Sanquan, the director of the armed forces committee, led the "Turning Over" Team and the militia to quickly and calmly occupy the fortifications, repelling five enemy assaults. When the enemy approached the fortifications, they erected ladders. Old Gao kicked a ladder over with one foot, followed by two hand grenades, and the enemies rolled down like dead pigs. More and more enemies came, climbing onto the houses and shouting, "Old Gao, surrender! We guarantee you'll be fine if you surrender!" Old Gao replied, "I'd rather die than surrender to you, you traitorous dogs!" and threw two more hand grenades. Then the enemy set up planks and crossed over from the eastern houses, quickly rushing to the front of the fortifications. Old Gao and Liu Laoxiao, an old farmer in his fifties, pushed the planks to the ground. Another group of enemies attacked the fortifications from behind. The machine-gun and grenade fire was too heavy, and they could no longer hold the fortifications. They retreated into the houses to continue their tenacious fight. The enemies were afraid to go down into the courtyard, shouting from the roofs, "Come out! If you don't come out, we'll set the house on fire!" At that time, Village Chief Li Mengzhou had already been seriously wounded three times; the director of the armed forces committee had sacrificed himself; and one of the militiamen, Liu Yongtian, showed signs of wavering and ran out of the courtyard, but was shot down by the enemy. In this tense and critical situation, Old Gao calmly directed everyone: "We would rather die than yield! Prepare the hand grenades! We cannot give our weapons to the enemy!"
　　After five hours of fighting, the bullets and hand grenades were exhausted. The enemy suffered twelve deaths and injuries and did not dare to come down into the courtyard, so they had to set the house on fire. Old Gao, Village Chief Li Mengzhou, and Deputy Village Chief Liu Gengchang gloriously sacrificed themselves in the sea of fire, embracing their rifles and facing the enemy until their deaths! As the enemy retreated in defeat, they were pursued by our Gaoyi Independent Battalion and nearby militia, and they fled back to Yuanshi City in a panic.
　　After Old Gao and the others heroically sacrificed themselves, the militia and farmers' association of Hetou Village, and all the farmers and masses, with tears of grief and indignation, ignited the flames of revenge. The next day, they held a large-scale struggle meeting to commemorate Comrade Gao Yunxing, the heroic and unyielding hero of liberation in the border areas, with concrete actions to completely eliminate feudalism.

　　农民之光
  　悼边地翻身英雄高云兴同志
    洛夫
    当我们提起笔写着高云兴时，一个结实、刚强黑黝黝的脸蛋，朴实而又健壮的影子出现在我的眼前。这位人民英雄在边地发动群众，在还乡团包围高邑河头村的战斗中，他壮烈地牺牲了。
    高云兴同志，沙河册井人，他是一个优秀的共产党员，册井的农会主席，一个四十五岁的老农民。在旧社会他当了半辈子长工，打了半辈子光棍汉，八路军解放册井后，他才翻了身，有了房子，也有了地。去年七月又娶了个老婆，正当他举行婚礼那一天，还没有洞房呢，下午他就接到通知：上级调他到翻身队工作，即日下午到城里集合。高云兴一想：“老婆已经娶来了，迟早跑不了。翻身工作却不能误了”！他背起行李就离了家。
    第二天到了临城分区翻身队受训。关于老高娶了老婆还未入洞房，就参加翻身队的故事，象神话一般传遍了翻身队，感动了很多不愿远离家乡，不愿离开老婆的落后分子。领导上又抓住这个典型的实例，登报表扬，给受训干部很大的教育。受训半月完毕，老高被调到高邑新区河头村帮助翻身工作。那个村离元氏城不远，群众的变天思想很严重，大都不敢接近翻身队。老高就到地里一面帮助老乡做活，一面和老乡闲扯、访苦、组织诉苦。他总是拿自己的切身经验，来说服群众：“我从前在村里组织农会，敌人的十三支队民军到处捣乱，不能在村里开会，黑夜还跑到山里去开会呢，今天这里有前方部队掩护，有政府给咱们撑腰作主，如果还不好好干，怎样对得起毛主席呀……。”
    老高在工作作风上，活泼深入，细心耐心，从来不摆架子，有说有笑，农民都喜欢接近他，特别是青年农民最爱接近他，大家给他起了个外号叫“老青年”。
    　　　◇　　　　　　　　◇　　　　　　　　　◇
    十一月十二日深夜，河头村被元氏“还乡团”包围，二百多敌人带了三挺机枪，两个掷弹筒，企图活捉翻身队的同志，摧毁我村政权。当时河头民兵，只有两枝湖北造大枪，八十粒子弹，二十八颗手榴弹。但当敌人机枪打响后，老高及武委会主任李三全同志，领导翻身队及民兵迅速沈着地占领工事，打退敌人五次冲锋。敌人接近工事，竖起了梯子，老高一脚将梯子踢翻了，接着打了两个手榴弹，敌人象死猪一样滚下去了。敌人越来越多啦，上了房高喊：“老高缴枪吧！投降保证没事！”老高回答：“死了也不投降你们狗汉奸！”又打了两个手榴弹。紧接着敌人架了木板从东边房子过来了，快冲到工事跟前啦，老高和五十来岁的老农民柳老孝把板子推翻到地下去了。另一股敌人又从后面打到工事来，机枪手榴弹火力太重，工事不能停站了，即撤到房里去继续顽强战斗。敌人不敢下房，在房上喊：“出来吧，不出来就放火烧房子啦！”当时村长李梦周已挂了三次重彩；武委会主任打牺牲了，其中有一个民兵柳永田表示动摇，跑出院去，但被敌人打倒了，在紧张危急万分的情况下，老高沈着地指挥大家：“我们宁死也不屈服，把手榴弹准备好，不能把武器送给敌人”！
    坚持了五小时战斗，子弹、手榴弹打光了，敌人死伤十二名，不敢下房，只好放火烧房子，老高及老农民村长李梦周，副村长柳更长，光荣地牺牲在火海中，临死还抱着大枪，面向敌人！敌人在败退时，遭我高邑独立营及附近民兵追击，狼狈地逃回元氏城。
    老高等壮烈牺牲后，河头村的民兵农会，全体农民、群众，都含着悲愤的眼泪，燃烧起复仇的怒火，第二天即开了一个大规模的斗争大会，以彻底消灭封建的实际行动，来纪念这位英勇不屈的边地翻身英雄——高云兴同志。
