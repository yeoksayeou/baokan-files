Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Lu-Yu Front, 13th: In the recent battle to liberate Yuncheng, the People's Liberation Army annihilated a division headquarters and two brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's troops. The PLA used approximately the same number of troops as the enemy, and completely overwhelmed the enemy with organized and intense artillery fire. According to interviews with soldiers on the front lines and information gleaned from captured Chiang Kai-shek officers: After learning that the PLA had crossed the Yellow River on the evening of the 30th, Liu Ruming, commander of the Chiang Kai-shek Zhengzhou Fourth Pacification Zone, telegraphed Cao Fulin, commander of the 55th Division, to adopt a key defensive tactic, saying: "As long as you concentrate on defending Yuncheng, there will be no problem." Cao Fulin then quickly ordered the troops in Yuncheng and along the riverbanks to withdraw to Yuncheng on the 2nd. Unexpectedly, that night the PLA followed closely and arrived in the suburbs of the city, forming an encirclement. On the evening of the 4th, the PLA attacked the South Gate. At this time, the Chiang Kai-shek troops did not expect the battle to develop so quickly. Cao Fulin hurriedly ordered the officers, who were attending a meeting of company-level cadres and above, to return to the gate to fight, but most of them were killed before reaching their command posts. The Chiang Kai-shek troops defending the South Gate were completely wiped out within half an hour. On the evening of the 7th, the PLA launched a general attack. At 19:00, the two sides engaged in an artillery battle. The Chiang Kai-shek troops relied on two outer trenches between the gate towers, and a minefield outside the trenches, to resist stubbornly, concentrating 118 artillery pieces of various calibers to bombard the PLA's attacking direction, with aircraft assisting in the battle. However, the PLA's artillery fire was even more intense and close, lasting for an hour. American-made heavy artillery bombarded the Chiang Kai-shek troops in the southwest corner of the city, creating a large breach with one shot, throwing the defending Chiang Kai-shek troops from the city wall and tossing them 30 meters into the air. Before the smoke and dust settled, our troops quickly broke into the city. Cao Fulin, the "General of Fixed Defense," had been hiding in a shelter 10 meters deep, but at this point, he hurriedly changed into civilian clothes, hid from his troops, and led a small number of "cronies" to escape from the East Gate. For a time, officers at all levels took off their American-made leather boots, discarded their American-style round caps, and threw away their guns and symbols, each seeking a way to escape. But the people's net of heaven and earth was everywhere, and there was little chance of escape. By 1:00 a.m., more than 4,000 officers and soldiers had been captured. Another group of Chiang Kai-shek troops fled south from the East Gate, but before they had gone three or four li, they fell into the PLA's ambush net on the Songkou River. Our army captured more than 1,500 people at the cost of very few casualties. Before dawn, the remaining enemies in the city surrendered in batches, and the battle ended.

    解放郓城之战
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线十三日电】此次解放军歼灭郓城蒋军一个师部和两个旅，使用的兵力大致和被歼的敌人相等，且以有组织的猛烈炮火完全压倒敌人。据记者在前线随军采访并由被俘蒋军军官口中探悉：当得悉解放军于三十日晚间横渡黄河后，蒋记郑州第四绥靖区司令官刘汝明即电告五十五师师长曹福林采取重点防御战术，他说：“只要集中固守郓城，就没有问题。”曹福林乃迅令郓城及沿河岸各据点的部队，于二日全部缩到郓城。不意是夜解放军即跟踪赶到城郊，形成包围。四日晚间，解放军攻击南关，此时蒋军尚未料到战事发展如此迅速。曹福林乃匆匆将正参加连以上的干部会议之军官饬返关内应战，但大半未到达指挥位置即被击毙。守南关之蒋军在半小时内，即被全部歼灭。七日晚解放军开始总攻击，十九时双方进行炮战，蒋军凭借关城之间两道外壕，及壕外满布之地雷区顽抗，集中各种口径炮一百一十八门向解放军进攻方向轰击，并有飞机助战。但解放军的炮火更为猛烈紧密，持续达一小时之久，美式重炮向西南城角蒋军轰击，一发即打开一大缺口，将守城之蒋军从城头掀起，抛入三十公尺之高空。烟尘未落，我军即迅速突入城内。“固守将军”曹福林原躲避于深达十公尺的掩蔽部内，至此仓惶换着便衣瞒着他的部队率领少数“亲信”从东门逃走，一时各级军官亦脱下美制皮靴抛弃美式圆形小帽，扔掉枪支符号，各觅去路。但到处有人民的天罗地网，很难有逃跑的机会。到深夜一时许，即已俘获官兵四千余人，另一部蒋军窜出东门向南逃窜，未及三数里至宋口河畔，陷入解放军预伏之捕捉网中。我军以极少数之伤亡代价，擒获一千五百余人。黎明之前，城内残敌分批先后缴械，战斗即告结束。
