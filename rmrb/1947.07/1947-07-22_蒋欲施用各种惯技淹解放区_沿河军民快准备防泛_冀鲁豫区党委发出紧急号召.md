　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Lu Yu, 20th—The CCP Hebei-Shandong-Henan District Committee issued an emergency directive on Yellow River flood prevention on July 10th. It pointed out: "The major flood season (scheduled to begin on July 20th) is approaching, and floods are imminent. The vicious and cruel reactionary Chiang Kai-shek will certainly intensify his usual tricks, such as using airplanes to bomb, special agents to sabotage, armed harassment, and digging dikes to breach the river, in order to inundate our liberated areas." It called on party, government, military, and civilians along the river to "immediately take action, fully prepare to overcome difficulties, and complete the flood prevention task. Against Chiang Kai-shek's sabotage, we should combine river defense with organizing armed protection of key projects. Against special agent sabotage, we should raise vigilance, organize the masses, and strictly prevent it. Each county head and district head should personally be responsible for organizing the masses for flood prevention and rescue."

    【新华社晋冀鲁豫二十日电】中共冀鲁豫区党委于七月十日发出关于黄河防泛的紧急指示。指出：“目前大泛期（按七月二十日起进入泛期）即至，洪水即将到来，穷凶极恶的反动派蒋介石，必将加紧用飞机轰炸、特务破坏、武装袭扰及挖堤决口等惯技，以淹没我解放区。”号召沿河党政军民“立即行动起来，充分准备克服困难，完成防泛任务，对蒋贼破坏应结合河防组织武装保护险工，对特务破坏应提高警惕，组织群众，严密防范。各县长、区长应亲自负责组织群众防泛抢险。”
