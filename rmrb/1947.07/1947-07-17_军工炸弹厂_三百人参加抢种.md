    Military Factory Makes Bombs
    300 People Participate in Rushing Planting
    [This newspaper report] On July 2nd, there was a little rain. The bomb factory of the Military Industry Department, fearing that a good opportunity would be missed, mobilized all its personnel to help the villagers plant crops. Sixty-seven head of livestock and 368 people were divided into 50 shock teams, mainly helping families of revolutionary martyrs, disabled soldiers, and poor villagers. In two days, a total of 207.5 mu were sown, and 108 loads of manure were carried. The workers' morale was particularly high. For example, Mo Ling (a young comrade) said, "We workers and peasants are one family, and we can only defeat Old Chiang by helping each other." Worker Hu Xiangjin said, "Our factory is truly a factory of the people. We help each other when something happens!" (Xi Ming)
    [This newspaper report] On July 2nd, the Post Office Main Office in the village received two or three fingers of rain. The masses were busy rushing to plant, and all postal service and postal school personnel, except for those who were ill, also participated, totaling 68 people and five head of livestock. In the process of labor, the comrades fully demonstrated their high enthusiasm for seeking benefits for the people and strived to be the first. For example, Comrade Li Junqing from the printing department, unable to participate during the day due to engraving work, spent the night with Comrades Wang Genglian and Xia Feng rolling six mu of land for their landlord. The next day, they took time out from their lunch break to carry out a surprise attack, taking time to participate in pulling the roller and the rake. Everyone pulled with great enthusiasm and care. Hao Fancheng, a small seventeen-year-old boy, participated in pulling the roller and raking 27.5 mu of land, doing more and better than others, becoming a model recognized by the entire bureau. By the evening of the 4th, the entire village had completed planting in one day, helping the masses pull rollers and rakes for 328 mu, helping with sowing and other tasks for 133 mu, spreading manure, planting beans, and weeding for 61 mu, and planting with livestock for 246 mu, totaling 768 mu.
