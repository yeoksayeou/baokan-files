　　Taihang Peasants Who Overturned Their Lives
  　Inspect Support for the Military During the Dragon Boat Festival
    [This newspaper reports] Not forgetting the Communist Party during the Dragon Boat Festival, supporting the Eighth Route Army while eating zongzi. Zhang Naishun, the village chief of Lijiayao Village in Licheng, and labor hero Jia Naibang (political director) called for welcoming the Dragon Boat Festival Support-the-Military Day, thoroughly inspecting substitute farming, so that the troops at the front can fight with peace of mind and win victories, and the rear can perform meritorious service in supporting the military. They organized various groups to inspect each other and held meetings to discuss the inspection. All 301.3 mu of autumn land of the 25 military and martyr families, 4 cadre families, 6 demobilized soldiers, and participating families were completely weeded, and 174.7 mu of grain land were hoed once. During the summer harvest, heroes Jia Naibang and Wang Ziping organized the masses to cut 41 mu of wheat for poor and labor-lacking military and cadre families for free as early as possible. They rushed to plant 21 mu of wheat stubble land, and organized military and cadre families to produce, with 34 women spinning 212 jin of cotton, earning 441,000 yuan, improving the lives of military families. Dazhai in Yushe also inspected support for the military during the Dragon Boat Festival Support-the-Military Day, and provided 71.4 mu of substitute farming land for 7 military families and 1 martyr family. All grain seedlings were weeded, miscellaneous fields were hoed twice, and the side embankments were neatly repaired, with 19 sections already repaired, totaling 344 zhang. They truly ensured that no military family land was left uncultivated, and helped military families get rich by carrying water and firewood. Ren Gaixiang, a woman from Xima Village, mobilized the women in the village to write letters to the soldiers and make comfort bags during the Dragon Boat Festival, making 41 bags in two days, filled with cigarettes and fruits. The three natural villages of Nanbei Mountain also rushed to make 70 bags. Lucheng Fourth District simultaneously launched a campaign to celebrate meritorious service; Xishenzhuang received the good news of Comrade Ru Shuanghu of the 50th Regiment of the 17th Division's meritorious service, and immediately held a meeting during the Dragon Boat Festival to celebrate meritorious service. At the meeting, Ru Shuanghu resolutely expressed his determination to carry out the revolution to the end, eliminate the reactionaries, and repay everyone. Comrade Yang Jinlin of Beicun was selected as a special model in the Military and Political University, and the masses in the whole village held a celebration meeting for meritorious service and support for the military during the Dragon Boat Festival. Li Chunfang, a military dependent, smiled while smoking a cigarette and said that he would write a letter to his son Xingyuan, telling him to work hard and kill more enemies so that he could also be glorious. The masses attending the meeting also proposed to perform meritorious service in the rear through production, frugality, and supporting the military.
