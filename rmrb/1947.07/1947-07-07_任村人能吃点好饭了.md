　　Ren Village People Can Eat Better Food Now
    Zhan Chao
    After spending some time with the liberated peasants of Ren Village in Helin County, I discovered that they have a food menu that, though unwritten, is almost identical for everyone: (1) Early morning and late at night, bran "籺＠" with vegetable soup (a thin rice soup made with carrots, locust fruits, etc.); (2) Midday, millet rice or mixed noodles with carrots; (3) During the New Year, holidays, or when relatives and friends come, eating white noodles, pancakes, dumplings, etc., with vermicelli and tofu stew for three to five meals.

    This is a very ordinary, even "meager" diet, but for the people of Ren Village, who call eating "drinking rice," it represents a general improvement in farmers' lives. Ma Guilan, the chairwoman of the women's rescue association in Second Street, who had been beaten, begged for food, and suffered for half her life, even composed a couplet to express this improved life, and asked someone to write it and post it in the main room:

    "Holding up the rice bowl, joy fills our face,
    In our liberation, we won't forget Chairman Mao!"

    This couplet, though simple, uses the redistribution of five thousand mu of land as its background and contains endless bitterness.

    Before the War of Resistance, the entire village had 820 households, 3,537 people, and 5,746 mu of land. That is to say, each person had an average of less than 1.7 mu of land.

    And in the early spring of 1940—the late period of Kuomintang rule—land ownership still exhibited an extremely unreasonable phenomenon:

    The 44 landlord and feudal rich peasant households in the entire village, with 405 people, owned 1,836 mu of cultivated land; the 796 peasant households, with 3,132 people, owned 3,808 mu of cultivated land. That is to say, on the one hand, less than 13 percent of the population occupied 40 percent of the land; on the other hand, a full 87 percent of the population only obtained 60 percent of the land. Moreover, among the 90 percent of the population mentioned above, there were 121 households, with 347 people, who were utterly destitute and had no land at all; while among the less than 10 percent of the population, one person alone occupied 27 mu of cultivated land (the landlord Chen Guifeng, with three people in his household, owned 82 mu). The situation was like this, and the land owned by the landlords was mostly of the best quality.

    Land annexation was carried out by extremely barbaric and cruel means. In a feudal society where "the gates of government offices face south, and those without money need not enter," what other options did the peasants have besides poverty, disease, starvation, and death?! Of course, there was no talk of eating or drinking.

    Since the spring of 1940, the Eighth Route Army drove away the reactionary Zhu Huaibing and established a democratic anti-Japanese government in Ren Village, implementing reasonable burdens, rent reduction, and interest reduction, especially the land reform since last autumn, which fundamentally changed the unreasonable phenomenon. Now, utter destitution has become a historical name. And the 486 households that rose from formerly utterly destitute and poor peasants to middle peasants, the 356 households of old middle peasants, and the two households of new rich peasants (one formerly poor, one formerly middle peasant), totaling 2,977 people and 5,493 mu of land, now own an average of 1.84 mu of land per person. In the past, in the six small streets, a total of 61 households with 253 people, during the Kuomintang rule, except for six landlord and rich peasant households with 22 people, the remaining 55 households with 231 people were entirely dependent on purchasing grain. Among them, six households purchased grain for less than half a year, twelve households for more than half a year, and thirty-two households for the entire year. Now, only 18 households with 96 people still need to purchase grain, and all of them do so for less than half a year. However, it must be explained that this is only a temporary phenomenon after the land reform has just been completed. According to the estimates of the grain-deficient households themselves, as long as they intensify production on the land they have been allocated this year, they will no longer need to purchase grain next year. In the past, in the Eleventh Street, where purchasing grain accounted for 70 percent of the total population, now not only does no one need to purchase grain, but some are even selling grain in the market. This year, in order to combat drought and prepare for famine, the living standards of Ren Village farmers will be somewhat lower than their original diet, but they are very confident in saying: "We won't eat bran five years from now!" And based on this, they have specifically formulated plans for expanded reproduction for individuals and the entire village, such as completing the large canal on the west slope within three years, etc.

    The liberated peasant Su Ziwei told a very interesting joke to describe their village, he said: "In the past, the people of Henan (referring to the south bank of the Yellow River) often said, "Whoever does evil will be reborn in Linxian County in the next life to eat bran and vegetables," thinking it was extremely bitter. In fact, at that time, we sometimes couldn't even eat these things!… Things will be different in the future! I'm afraid even the ghosts reborn here won't recognize our poor Ren Village, with its "thick stones and thin soil"! If they stay for two days, I guarantee they won't want to leave!" Someone said, "That's right." When the people of Ren Village pick up their bowls and sit together to eat, everyone picks up their chopsticks, looks at the bowl, and can't stop talking about how happy they are.

　　任村人能吃点好饭了
    展潮
    和林县任村翻身农民相处了一些日子，我发现他们一张没有明文记载，但却几乎完全相同的饭单：（一）清早黑夜，糠窝“籺＠”配菜汤（用红萝葡、槐树果等熬成的一种稀米汤）；（二）晌午，小米捞饭，或杂面条配红萝葡菜；（三）过年过节或亲戚朋友来了，吃三五顿白面条、烙饼、饺子之类，配些粉条豆腐卤。
    这是一种极平常，甚至是“寒酸”的吃食，但对于把吃饭叫做“喝饭”的任村东说，却表示着农民生活的普遍上升。挨过打，讨过饭，受了半辈子罪的二街妇救会主席马桂兰，更把这种上升的生活编成对子，请人写了贴在堂屋里：
    “端起饭碗喜盈盈
    翻身不忘毛主席！”
    这副对子虽简单却是以五千亩土地的变动来作背景，包含着无限的辛酸的。
    抗战前全村八二○户，三五三七口人，五七四六亩地。就是说每人平均不到一亩七分地。
    而一九四○年春初——国民党统治末期。土地的占有还表现着一种极不合理的现象：
    全村地主封建富农四四户，四○五口人，占有一八三六亩耕地；农民七九六户、三一三二口人、占有三八○八亩耕地。就是说一方面不到百分之十三的人口却占据着百分之四十的土地；另一方面整整百分之八十七的人口，只获得百分之六十的土地。而且在上面所说的百分之九十的人口中，还有一二一户、三四七口人，是根本连片土垄地都没有的赤贫；而在不到百分之十的人口中，竟有一个人独占到二十七亩耕地者，（地主陈桂丰三口人，占有八十二亩）情形便是这样，而且地主所有的地又多是上好地。
    土地兼并是以极其野蛮、残酷的手段在进行着的。在“天下衙门朝南开，有理没钱莫进来”的封建社会里，农民除了贫、病、饿、死外，还有别的什么办法呢？！当然谈不到什么吃喝了。
    自一九四○年春起，八路军赶走了反动的朱怀冰，在任村建立起民主的抗日政权，实行合理负担、减租减息，特别是自去秋以来的土地改革，才使不合理的现象发生了根本的变化。现在，赤贫已经成为历史上的名字了。而由过去赤贫、贫农上升的四八六户耕中农、三五六户老中农、二户新富农（一贫、一中农），共二九七七口人、五四九三亩地，平均每人拥有一亩八分四厘地。过去六小街：共满六十一户、二百五十三口人、国民党统治时代除六户地主富农二十二口人外，其余五十五户、二百三十一口人、完全是籴粮吃。其中籴粮食半年以下的六户，半年以上的十二户，全年的三十二户。现在需籴粮食吃的只剩下十八户、九十六口人，为期都在半年以下了。但还须说明这仅是土地改革刚完成后的临时现象，据缺粮户自己估计，只要经过今年一年，在分得的土地上加紧生产，明年便可以不籴粮食吃了。国民党统治时代籴粮食吃占总人口百分之七十的十一小街，现在不仅没有一家籴粮，而且还有在市场上抛售粮食的了。今年为了抗旱备荒，任村农民生活水平还要比他们原来的饭单降低些，但是他们却很有信心地说：“五年以后不吃糠！”并且根据这，具体订了个人和全村扩大再生产的计划。例如三年内完成西坡的大渠等等。
    翻身农民苏子为，讲了一段很有意思的笑话来形容他们的村子，他说：“过去河南（指黄河南岸）老百姓常好说，“谁要是作孽，下辈子投胎投到林涉县去吃糠咽菜”，以为苦得不得了。其实那时候呀我们有时连这些东西都吃不上！………往后可不同啦！怕连投胎来这里的鬼，都认不出咱这“石厚土薄”的穷任村啦！住上两天，管保他还不愿意走呢！”有人说：“可不是。”当任村人拿起串门碗，蹲在一块吃饭的时候，大家把筷子一挑，眼看着碗里，高兴的话便说不完了。
