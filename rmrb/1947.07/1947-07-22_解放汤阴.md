　　Liberation of Tangyin
    Lin Xiangji
    During the recent struggle against the arch-tyrant Su Boyin in Tangyin, Liu Dai, chairman of the people's association, and a group of young men composed a clapper talk, with one sentence from you and one from me, as follows:

    The Eighth Route Army is really capable,
    A large army comes to fight Tangyin County,
    Shouting to catch Sun Laodian.
    Sun Laodian is worried,
    First demolish the bungalows, then the buildings.
    Demolishing the buildings is not enough,
    Houses in all six passes are burned.
    The common people can't stand it,
    Forced to flee to the city.
    ×　　×　　×
    Relatives also come to find,
    Friends also come to call,
    Sun Laodian says:
    "Orders are like a mountain,
    Who dares to mess around,"
    We'll all be sent to the Yue Wang Temple.
    ×　　×　　×
    After eating, nothing to do,
    Comes the bastard Su Boyin.
    This one is scared to death when they see him,
    That one trembles when they see him.
    Su Boyin says:
    "I'm telling you all to dig ditches,
    You have to keep going until you die."
    ×　　×　　×
    Our army opens Tangyin County,
    Street offices are set up in the passes,
    Comrades Liu and Li care for us:
    Past sad events,
    All come to tell.
    Speaking of Su Boyin,
    His crimes are as great as the sky,
    Saving the rich but not the poor (note),
    A traitor to two countries (referring to Japan and the United States),
    He has committed all four major crimes,
    He was struggled against in three mass meetings,
    Boyin had nothing to say in his defense.
    District office, support us,
    First divide the property, then the land,
    Shooting Su Boyin concluded the show.
    (Note) Su Boyin once served as a Kuomintang relief committee member, specializing in using grain and money to "relieve" the escaped landlords.

　　解放汤阴
    林湘辑
    汤阴近日斗争大恶霸苏伯寅时，平民会主席刘代和一群小伙子，你一句我一句编成了一个快板，如下：
    八路军，真能干，
    大军来打汤阴县，
    声声要捉孙老殿。
    孙老殿，发了愁，
    先掀平房后掀楼。
    掀了楼，还不算，
    六关的房子烧个遍。
    老百姓没法站，
    逼得城里去逃难。
    ×　　×　　×
    亲戚也来找，
    朋友也来叫，
    孙老殿说：
    “命令如山倒，
    谁敢瞎胡闹，”
    把咱大家送到岳王庙。
    ×　　×　　×
    吃罢饭，没事干，
    来了苏伯寅忘八蛋。
    这个见了害了怕
    那个见了打战战。
    苏伯寅说：
    “叫你大家去挖沟，
    至死也得往前干。”
    ×　　×　　×
    咱们军队打开汤阴县，
    街公所，关里按，
    刘同志、李同志爱护咱：
    往年的伤心事，
    都来诉一番。
    说起了苏伯寅，
    罪恶大如天，
    救富不救贫（注），
    两国当汉奸（指日、美），
    四大条件他都犯，
    三次大会斗争他，
    说的伯寅没啥辩。
    区公所，支撑咱，
    先分家业，后分地，
    枪毙苏伯寅住了戏。
    （注）苏伯寅曾任国民党救济委员，专以粮款“救济”脱亡地主。
