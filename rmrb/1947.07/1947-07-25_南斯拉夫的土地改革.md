Land Reform in Yugoslavia
    Bomieranchefu
    On November 29, 1945, shortly after the general election in Yugoslavia, the first session of the Constituent Assembly opened. On that day, the Constituent Assembly unanimously adopted the historic decision to eliminate the monarchy and establish the Republic of Yugoslavia.

    On December 3, the draft constitution was announced. This draft was discussed in detail not only by the relevant committees of the Constituent Assembly but also by the people of the whole country, and the discussion by the entire people continued for nearly two months. The Constituent Assembly accepted the opinions and amendments put forward during the discussion and unanimously adopted the Constitution of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia on January 31, 1946.

    The adoption of the new constitution completed an important stage in the history of Yugoslavia's development—the stage of the national war against fascist aggressors and domestic reactionary forces for liberation and unification within the framework of an independent democratic state. The constitution consolidated the most important achievements of the national liberation struggle, and first and foremost, consolidated the power of the Yugoslav people and the complete equal rights of all nationalities.

    The cornerstone of the new constitution is Article 6:

    "In the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, all power comes from and belongs to the people. The people exercise power through the representative organs of state power elected by free elections—the People's Committees, which were generated and developed from the local People's Committees during the national liberation struggle against fascism and reactionary forces into the parliaments of the various republics and the National Assembly of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, and they are the main achievements of this struggle."

    One of the special developments of Yugoslav democracy lies in the fact that the existing state power was not inherited from the old pre-war regime; on the contrary, today's people's power has grown and been consolidated in the struggle against the anti-people old regime institutions. The old Yugoslav state institutions were built on the basis of a semi-fascist constitution imposed on the country, relying on the reactionary groups in society, and serving the interests of the power of the Greater Serbian imperialists; they implemented a regime of economic and political enslavement of other nationalities—Croats, Slovenes, Montenegrins, Macedonians.

    The old Yugoslav state institutions were maintained and utilized by German and Italian fascist bandits. During the national liberation war against the fascist bandits, Yugoslav patriots began to establish new state institutions that could mobilize the masses of the people to participate in the cause of war and the labor heroism of peaceful construction. The People's Committees and parliaments elected by universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot have become the basis of state institutions. The broadest masses of the people directly participate in deciding the most important issues of the country through the People's Committees. The method of discussing and adopting the new constitution is a vivid example. Every enterprise, national and local institution, educational institution, and even the most remote small village discussed the draft constitution. The implementation of the Land Reform Law provided another example. After the government adopted the Land Reform Law, the People's Committees, based on the masses of peasants, began to implement it. For this purpose, conferences were held all over the country, attended by peasants who demanded land distribution, as well as landlords whose land should be distributed and managers of church land that should be confiscated. In these meetings, detailed plans were drawn up, and the deadlines for land distribution were determined. The People's Committees and the peasants themselves monitored every attempt by the big landlords to evade the law and hide land.

    　　　　　　★　　　　　　　　★　　　　　　　　★

    In today's Yugoslavia, democratic reforms rely on a solid economic foundation. The dominant position in the pre-war Yugoslav economy was occupied by foreign financial capital, primarily German capital. Banks, chemical, electrical, metallurgical, textile, and paper industries were almost entirely in the hands of German capitalists. German control was particularly strengthened during the regimes of Stojadinović, Cvetković, and Krošec (during the German occupation), who themselves were managers of large banks and experts in monopoly mergers.

    After Yugoslavia was occupied, German capital seized all the main positions in the national economy. The owners of banks and large enterprises largely cooperated with the German and Italian bandits.

    In order to continue and completely eradicate fascism from the economic and political life of Yugoslavia, the Presidium of the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia adopted a decision on November 21, 1944, to confiscate enemy property. This decision transferred the following property to state ownership: all property of Hitler's Germany and its citizens within the territory of Yugoslavia, all property of German nationals (except those who are now in neutral countries and had no hostile relations with the liberation movement during the war and those who participated in the resistance movement in the ranks of the National Liberation Army), all property of war criminals and their accomplices, and property that should be confiscated according to special court decrees.

    Subsequently, the decision to confiscate enemy property was approved by the Provisional National Assembly and the Constituent Assembly. Its effective implementation essentially increased the proportion of the state-owned sector in the national economy; and this state-owned sector has become the largest factor in the country's political and economic development. Eighty-two percent of all industry is state-owned, while private enterprises account for eighteen percent. In the metal industry, state-owned enterprises account for eighty-seven percent, in the chemical industry, ninety-two percent, and in the electrical industry, ninety-five percent. In some regions of Yugoslavia, such as Slovenia, the state-owned sector owns all large-scale industries and a large part of medium-sized industries. Moreover, if the state-owned sector in the old Yugoslavia served the interests of the reactionary ruling oligarchy, then the development of the state-owned sector now has only one purpose: to ensure social progress and the growing prosperity of the masses of the people. Article 16 of the new constitution stipulates that the state-owned sector of the national economy is the country's primary economic pillar.

    With the people in power, the actual existence of a strong state-owned sector cannot but have a beneficial impact on the rural economy.

    The Land Reform Law passed by the Third Session of the Provisional National Assembly in August 1945 created the premise for the implementation of Article 19 of the new constitution promulgated on December 3. This article stipulates: the tiller owns the land. In pre-war Yugoslavia, 337,429 poor peasant farms owned only 540,369 hectares (hectares), while 208 large landowners (of whom no less than three-quarters were Germans, Hungarians, and Italians) owned 389,826 hectares of land. The Catholic Church was also the largest landowner. According to the Land Reform Law, the property of large landowners was unconditionally confiscated and distributed to landless or land-poor peasants. If the cultivated land of each household exceeds 25 to 35 hectares, the excess part should be distributed to the peasants. For these wealthy peasants, appropriate bonuses are given for the land that exceeds the current maximum amount and should be transferred. As a result of the reform, 95 percent of all arable land will be in the hands of peasants.

    Although the land reform was fully implemented, a large number of peasant families migrated from barren and war-torn areas such as Bosnia, Montenegro, and Dalmatia to the fertile Vojvodina Plain; however, if agricultural productivity is not greatly improved, it will still not be able to meet the needs of Yugoslav peasants. The development of the cooperative movement in rural areas and the state's assistance to poor and middle peasants are sufficient to solve this problem. New credit, marketing, consumer, and production cooperatives, as well as the restoration of old cooperative institutions, are booming at the same time. These cooperatives are linked to state-owned cooperatives through the established central cooperatives. Since the liberation of Yugoslavia, 7,348 cooperatives have been established, with 1.2 million members. In Serbia, about 70 percent of villages and towns have cooperatives. In Dalmatia, cooperatives have 80 percent of the residents. In Slovenia, 118 new cooperatives are engaged in the reconstruction of destroyed villages, 40 livestock and 30 winemaking cooperatives. Cooperatives have also been widely established in Macedonia and Montenegro, where there were previously almost no such organizations.

    In the implementation of land reform, especially among immigrants, production cooperatives have emerged—collective farming companies. The possibility of such company institutions, established on the principle of absolute voluntariness, has been foreseen by the Land Reform Law. The property of large landowners is used to create several mechanical tractor stations, which are state-owned property and are dedicated to serving the needs of farmers.

    Thus, the cooperative part of the Yugoslav national economy, along with the state-owned part, is the second important factor in economic policy.

    This does not mean that there is no room for the development of individual economy and private enterprises in the new Yugoslavia. The new constitution guarantees private property and private enterprises in the economy, but does not allow the use of individual rights to undermine society. Article 18 of the constitution prohibits the organization and activities of private monopoly mergers (cartels, syndicates, trusts, etc.).

    　　　　　　★　　　　　　　★　　　　　　　★

    As a result of the liberation war and the strengthening of the democratic regime, Yugoslavia has undergone important socio-economic changes. Article 14 of the constitution reads:

    "The means of production in the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia are either the property of the entire people (that is, property in the hands of the state), or the property of the cooperative institutions of the people of all nationalities, or the property of individual natural or legal persons. All mines and other underground resources, liquids (including mineral and medicinal liquids), natural energy resources, railway and air transport, postal, telegraph, telephone and radio are the property of the entire people. The means of production in the hands of the state are used by the state itself or allowed to be used by others."

    Under these circumstances, the Yugoslav democratic government can systematically begin to implement economic development. For this purpose, the State Planning Commission, headed by the Minister of Industry, was established.

    The democratic foundation in all areas of social life has aroused a broad labor upsurge in cities and villages. In this way, the difficulties of national economic construction are overcome more quickly on a large scale.

    　　　　　　★　　　　　　　★　　　　　　　★

    But it would be wrong to think that Yugoslavia's economic and political development is proceeding peacefully and smoothly. Nothing is done without the opposition of the enemies of the democratic order. Everyone knows that the anti-people behavior of Yugoslav reactionaries is encouraged from abroad.

    The new Yugoslavia must overcome many remaining difficulties on the road to economic and socio-political development. However, there is no doubt that the Yugoslav masses and the organizations leading them are determined to overcome these difficulties with full force and complete the tasks facing the motherland.

    　　　　　　　　(Translated by Li Ang from the New Era magazine, Issue 6, 1946)

    The new democratic countries in Southeastern Europe have laid the economic foundation of new democracy, and are consolidating and developing it. These countries will certainly be able to complete the post-war economic recovery and construction with their own strength, and the increasing consolidation of the new democratic regime is a guarantee for the progress and success of this economic construction. The attempt of American imperialism to use some small mice hidden in these countries to undermine the foundation will never succeed. This article was written in March last year and was originally titled "Democratic Development in Yugoslavia"; this article can help us see where the source of power of the new democratic countries lies. Comrade Li Ang has excerpted and translated it for your reference. Because the translation focuses on the part related to land reform, this title is used for publication. ——Editor

　　南斯拉夫的土地改革
    波美兰切夫
    一九四五年十一月二十九日，南斯拉夫普选后不久，立宪会议第一次会议开幕。就在那天，立宪会议一致通过了关于清除君主政体，成立南斯拉夫共和政体的具有历史意义的决定。
    十二月三日，宪法草案宣布。这个草案不但为立宪会议的各有关委员会而且为全国人民所详细讨论，全体人民的讨论继续了几近两个月。立宪会议接受讨论过程中所提出的意见和修正，于一九四六年一月三十一日一致通过南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国宪法。
    新宪法的通过，完成了南斯拉夫发展的历史中的重要阶段——为了在独立民主国家范围内的解放和统一而进行的反对法西斯侵略者和国内反动势力的民族战争阶段，该宪法巩固着民族解放斗争的最重要的成就，而首先就巩固着南斯拉夫人民权力及各民族的完全平等权利。
    新宪法的基石是第六条：
    “在南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国中，一切权力均来自人民而且属于人民。人民行使权力乃通过由自由选举产生之国家权力的代表机关——各人民委员会，它们在反对法西斯主义及反动势力的民族解放斗争中，由各地方的人民委员产生和发展成各人民共和国的议会及南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国的国民议会，而且它们是这斗争的主要成就。”
    南斯拉夫民主的特别发展之一在于：现存的国家权力不是继承战前旧政权来的；相反的，今日的人民权力是在对反人民的旧政权机构之斗争中生长和巩固起来的。旧南斯拉夫的国家机构建筑在硬加于国家之上的半法西斯宪法基础上、依靠于社会上的反动集团，它为大塞尔维亚帝国主义者权力的利益而服务；他们实行着在经济与政治上奴役其他民族——哥罗特人、斯洛文人、门的内哥罗人、马其顿人——的政权。
    南斯拉夫旧国家机构是由德、意法西斯强盗所维持和利用的。在反对法西斯强盗的民族解放战争过程中，南斯拉夫爱国者开始建立新的国家机构，它可以动员人民大众参加战争事业与和平建设的劳动英雄主义，由普遍、平等、直接和不记名投票选举出的人民委员会及议会已成国家机构的基础。最广大的人民大众通过人民委员会去直接参加决定国家最重要的问题。新宪法的讨论与通过的方法，就是一个鲜明的例证。每一个企业、全国的与地方的机构、教育机关、甚至最偏僻的小村中都讨论了宪法草案。土地改革法的实行，提供了另外一个例证。政府采用土地改革法之后，各人民委员会在农民群众基础上，开始将它实现。以此目的，全国各地召开了会议，参加会议的有要求分地的农民，也有其土地应受分配的地主和应被没收的教会土地的管理者。在这些会议中，制定了详细的计划，决定了分配土地的期限。人民委员会和农民自己都监视着大地主要逃避法律隐蔽土地的每一企图。
    　　　　　　★　　　　　　　　★　　　　　　　　★
    在今日的南斯拉夫，民主的改革依靠着稳固的经济基础。战前南斯拉夫经济中的统治地位被外国金融资本所占有，而首先就是德国人的资本。银行、化学、电工、冶金、纺织和造纸工业几乎全部都握在德国资本家手中。德人的控制在斯多亚金诺维契、茨卫特柯维契及克罗雪茨政权时（德国侵占期间）特别加强了，而这些人自己就是大银行的经理和垄断并吞的专家。
    在南斯拉夫遭占领以后，德人资本将南国经济内一切主要地位均握在其手中。银行的及大企业的所有者极大部分均与德意强盗合作。
    为了从南斯拉夫的经济及政治生活中继续和完全地铲除法西斯主义，南斯拉夫民族解放反法西斯委员会的主席团在一九四四年十一月二十一日通过了将敌人财产没收的决定。这个决定将下列财产收归国家所有，即：希特勒德国及其公民在南斯拉夫领土内的一切财产，一切德国国籍者的财产（除了那些现在是中立国的而且在战时对解放运动无敌对关系的人们和那些在民族解放军的行列中参加抵抗运动的人们以外），一切战犯及其帮凶的财产，以及按照法庭的特别法令应充公的财产。
    其后，敌人财产充公的决定又由临时国民议会及立宪会议所批准。其确实的实行，在本质上增加了国有部分在国民经济中的比重；而此国有部分，已成为国家政治经济发展的最大要素。全体工业的百分之八十二是国有的，而同时私人企业共占百分之十八。在五金工业中国有者占百分之八十七，在化学工业中占百分之九十二，在电工工业中占百分之九十五。在南斯拉夫有些地区，譬如在斯洛文尼亚，那里国有部分拥有一切大工业和重大部分的中型工业。而且如果在旧南斯拉夫中国有部分给反动的统治寡头的利益服务，那么现在国有部分的发展只有一个目的，即保证社会的进步与人民大众繁荣的增长。新宪法第十六条规定国民经济的国有部分为国家首要的经济支柱。
    在人民有了权力的情况下，有力的国有部分之实际存在对农村经济情况就不能没有有利的影响。
    一九四五年八月临时国民议会的第三次会议所通过的土地改革法给十二月三日公布的新宪法第十九条的实现造成了前提。该条规定：耕者有其田。在战前的南斯拉夫，三三七·四二九个贫农农庄只有地五四○·三六九海克脱（公顷），而二○八个大土地所有者（其中不下四分之三的是德、匈、意人）占有土地三八九·八二六海克脱。天主教堂也是最大的土地所有者。按照土地改革法，大地主的财产无条件地没收，而且分给无地或少地的农民。每一农户其耕地如超过二十五至三十五海克脱，则其超过部分应分配给农民。对这些富有的农民，其超过现行最高额而应转让之土地，给以适当的赏金。改革之进行的结果，全部可耕地中百分之九十五将握在农民手中。
    虽然土地改革完全实现，大批的农民家庭由波斯尼亚、门的内哥罗和达尔马提亚等贫瘠和受战争之苦最甚的地区迁移到肥沃的沃耶沃金平原；但是如果不大大提高农业生产力，那就仍然不能满足南斯拉夫农民的需要。农村中合作运动的发展和国家对贫中农的帮助足以解决这个问题。新的信用、运销、消费及生产合作社与旧的合作社机关的恢复，同时蓬勃的建立起来，这些合作社通过成立起来的各中心合作社与国有合作社联系着。自南斯拉夫解放之时起，已建立七千三百四十八个合作社，拥有社员一百二十万人。在塞尔维亚约有百分之七十的村镇都有合作社。在达尔马提亚合作社拥有居民百分之八十。在斯洛文尼亚有一百一十八个新合作社从事重建被毁乡村的工作，四十个养畜及三十个酿酒合作社。在马其顿及门的内哥罗也普遍建立起来了合作社，在那些地方以前几乎没有过合作社这类组织。
    在实现土地改革时，特别是在移民中间，涌现出生产合作社——集体种地的公司。这种建立在绝对自愿原则上的公司机构的可能性，已为土地改革法所预见。大土地所有者的财物被用来创建若干机械拖拉机站，这些站都是国有的财产，专为农民的需要而服务。
    如此，南斯拉夫国民经济的合作部分，与国有的并列，是经济政策的第二个重要因素。
    这并不是说在新的南斯拉夫没有个体经济和私人企业发展的余地。新宪法保证经济中的私人财产和私人企业，但是不许利用个人权利破坏社会。宪法第十八条禁止私人垄断合并（卡特尔、辛狄加、托辣斯等等）的组织与活动。
    　　　　　　★　　　　　　　★　　　　　　　★
    因解放战争的及民主政权加强的结果，南斯拉夫生出重要的社会经济的改变。宪法第十四条写着：
    “南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国的生产工具或为全体人民的财产（即在国家手中的财产），或为各民族人民合作机构的财产，或为个别自然人或法人的财产。一切矿山和其他地下财富、液体（包括矿物的和药物的液体）、动力的自然资源、铁路和航空交通工具、邮政、电报、电话和无线电均为全体人民的财产。那些在国家手中的生产工具由国家自己使用或者让别人使用。”
    在这些情形下，南斯拉夫民主政府可能有计划地开始实行经济发展。为此目的，以工业部长为首的国家计划委员会便成立了。
    社会生活一切领域中的民主基础，激起城市和乡村广大的劳动热潮。以此，在广大的范围内更迅速的克服了国家经济建设的困难。
    　　　　　　★　　　　　　　★　　　　　　　★
    但是如果以为南斯拉夫经济政治的发展进行得和平及平坦，那就错了。没有一件事的进行，没有民主秩序的敌人之反对。谁都知道，南斯拉夫反动分子反人民的行为是受到国外的鼓励。
    新南斯拉夫必须克服经济与社会政治发展道路上尚存的许多困难。然而毫无疑问的，南斯拉夫的人民大众及领导他们的组织，决心以充分的力量克服这些困难，完成摆在祖国面前的任务。
