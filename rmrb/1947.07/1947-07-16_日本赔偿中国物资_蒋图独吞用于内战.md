Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 7th: The first batch of Japanese reparations to China amounts to approximately 700,000 tons. Chiang Kai-shek is attempting to embezzle this fruit of the Chinese people's eight years of bloody resistance, turning it into the private property of the Four Big Families and using it as war funds to slaughter the Chinese people. In a statement released on the 5th, the person in charge of the Chiang government's Executive Yuan's Reparations Committee not only disregarded the demands of the people in the liberated areas for the allocation of Japanese reparations, but also refused to provide reparations in kind to industrialists and businessmen in the KMT-controlled areas who suffered losses during the war. Instead, they only allocated a portion of the reparations for conditional sales at a price. The "Price List Measures" announced on the same day stipulated that industrialists and businessmen who apply for this item and are approved by the Chiang government must pay 40% of the total price before receiving the goods, with the remaining 60% to be paid off within two years. Furthermore, the cost of shipping from Japan to China and domestic transportation must be covered by themselves. If they fail to meet the above conditions, the deposit they originally paid will be confiscated by the Chiang government and "not refunded."

    日本赔偿中国物资
    蒋图独吞用于内战
    【新华社陕北七日电】首批日本赔偿物资，中国分得部分约为七十万吨，蒋介石正企图将此项中国人民八年流血抗战的胜利果实，独吞作为四大家族之私产，并充作屠杀中国人民之战费。蒋政府行政院赔偿委员会负责人于五日发表的谈话中，不仅置解放区人民对分配日本赔偿物资之要求于不顾，而且拒绝将赔偿物资无价赔偿给蒋管区在战时遭受损失之工商业家，而仅仅划出赔偿物资的一部分，实行条件十分苛刻之按价配售。其同日公布之“价册办法”规定，工商业家之作是项申请并经蒋政府核准者，收货之前须付出全部价格的百分之四十，另外百分之六十则于二年内交清，其自日进华及在国内转运之运费且须自己另筹，如不能履行以上条件时，其原先缴纳之保证金，即被蒋政府没收“不予退还”。
