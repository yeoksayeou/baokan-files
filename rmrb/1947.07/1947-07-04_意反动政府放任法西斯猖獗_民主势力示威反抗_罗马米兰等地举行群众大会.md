Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st -- Comprehensive reports: Since Gasperi formed a purely Christian Democratic government, the political situation in Italy has undergone great turbulence. On one side, reactionary elements and fascists are running rampant, and on the other, the democratic movement is surging. On the 24th, in Sicily, there appeared terrorist actions by the reactionary land party, backed by landlords, threatening democratic parties and groups, and beating democratic figures, even to the point of insulting and beating democratic representatives in the Sicilian Provincial Assembly. In the "Fascist Revolutionary Action" underground organization that was uncovered, fascist weapons and ammunition were found. The legally existing fascist organization, the "Italian Social Movement," is secretly controlled by a "provisional fascist government" based in Argentina. These reactionary activities are all related to the Gasperi government and are currently facing resolute opposition from Italian democratic forces. Corosanni, the representative of the People's Union, denounced the land party in the Sicilian Provincial Assembly in Palermo. The people of Palermo held a demonstration in front of the provincial government on the 25th, demanding the resignation of the government that condones reactionary elements. On the same day, mass rallies against the atrocities of the land party were held in Rome, Genoa, Milan, and other cities. More than 100,000 people participated in the Milan rally. At meetings held in Rome, Genoa, and Florence, representatives from the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Italian Labor People's Party, the Action Party, the Republican Party, and the Labor Democratic Party decided to establish a "Republican Front for the Defense of Freedom" to counter fascist terrorism. Di Vittorio and Santi, secretaries of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, along with a delegation of Sicilian labor representatives, met with Gasperi and handed him a resolution from the General Confederation of Labor. The resolution demanded that the government severely punish the political bandits in Sicily and implement land reform in Sicily to eradicate the reactionaries among the landlords. Prior to this Sicilian incident, democratic newspapers had already exposed Gasperi's reactionary nature. The Socialist Party's organ, Avanti, sharply pointed out: "Leftist words, rightist actions; leftist platform, rightist figures;—this is Gasperi's 'centrism' in practice." The Republican Party's organ stated that the formation of Gasperi's government demonstrated that the Christian Democratic Party had embarked on a shameful path of suicide.

　　意反动政府放任法西斯猖獗
  　民主势力示威反抗
    罗马米兰等地举行群众大会
    【新华社陕北一日电】综合报导：自加斯贝利组成了清一色的基督教民主党政府以后，意大利政局掀起了很大的波澜。一面是反动分子与法西斯分子的猖獗，另一面是民主运动的高涨。廿四日在西西里出现了以地主为背景的反动的土地党人的恐怖行动，威胁民主党派与团体，殴打民主人士，至于辱打西西里省议会中之民主代表。被破获的“法西斯革命行动”地下组织中，竟搜出法西斯分子之武器、军火。合法存在的法西斯团体“意大利社会运动”，暗中受控制于设在阿根廷的“临时法西斯政府”。这些反动分子的活动，均与加斯贝利政府有关，目前也遭受意大利民主力量坚决反对。人民联盟的代表科罗桑尼，在巴勒摩之西西里省议会中斥责土地党人。巴勒摩人民于廿五日在省政府门前举行示威游行，要求纵容反动分子之政府辞职。同日在罗马、热那亚、米兰及其他各城市都举行了反对土地党暴行的群众大会。参加米兰群众大会者在十万人以上。在罗马、热那亚、佛罗伦斯召开的会议上，共产党、社会党、意大利劳动人民党、行动党、共和党及劳工民主党的代表，为了对抗法西斯恐怖主义，已决定建立“保卫自由的共和阵线”。意大利劳工联合会书记狄维多里俄与山蒂偕西西里劳动人民代表团谒见加斯贝利，并将劳工联合会决议一件交给加氏。该决议要求政府严厉处置西西里的政治匪徒，及在西西里实行土地改革以根除在地主之反动。在此次西西里事件之前，各民主报纸中早已揭发加斯贝利的反动性，社会党机关报亚凡蒂锋锐的指出：“左的言词，右的行动；左的政纲，右的人物；——这就是实践中的加斯贝利的‘中间主义’。”共和党机关报谓：加氏政府的组成，说明了基督教民主党已走上可耻的自杀道路。
