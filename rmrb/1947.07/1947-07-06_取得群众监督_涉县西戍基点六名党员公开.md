　　Gaining Mass Supervision
　　Six Party Members in Xishe Base Point, She County, Publicly Identified
　　[Our newspaper, She County] The liberated peasants of the entire Third District warmly commemorated "July 1st." The four villages of the Xishe Base Point, under the direct leadership of the district office, held a large meeting. Although the weather was very hot, the liberated peasants from each village still came to participate with excitement. Wang, an old man from Xishe, said, "The Communist Party is our reborn parent; how can we forget the birthday of our elders?" At the beginning of the meeting, the entire venue solemnly mourned the six communist party members, including Fu Gaisuo, who died in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Self-Defense War in this base point. The masses spontaneously organized a traditional musical ensemble, playing mournful music. A liberated peasant from Dongshe, carrying eight steamed buns and holding a flower, walked to the offering table and presented them, saying, "Without your sacrifice and bloodshed, how could we have been liberated? We will not forget this kindness." Then, six Communist Party members, including Zhang Xiu, the political director of Songjiazhuang, publicly introduced their own history of leading the masses in struggle, asking the masses for more criticism. Wang Youlu, an old man from Xishe, said, "In the past, we only knew that the Communist Party led us to liberation, but we didn't know where the Communist Party was. Today, seeing these comrades, we know that they were the comrades who were with us, leading us in the struggle for liberation. From now on, we must follow the Communist Party, and I want to offer flowers to the Communist Party comrades to express my respect." As he spoke, the old man hung eight large red flowers on the chests of the six party members on the stage. One speaker followed another. An honest peasant from Dongshe walked onto the stage and said, "I have been poor all my life. Without the Communist Party, I would not have today, and I would not be on this stage, speaking confidently in front of people. From now on, no matter what—production, thrift, famine relief, joining the army… I will definitely listen to the Communist Party and follow the Communist Party."
　　Finally, Comrade Chen, the secretary of the sub-committee, spoke, outlining the history of party building in the Third District and calling on the masses to supervise the party, frequently offering opinions to party members, and calling on party members and the masses to work together to overcome waste, pay attention to thrift, and overcome the drought. The masses present responded in unison, dispersing amidst shouts of "Party members and the masses unite to overcome the disaster!" (Fan Zhi)

　　取得群众监督
  　涉县西戍基点六名党员公开
    【本报涉县讯】三区全区翻身农民热烈纪念“七一”。西戍基点四个村在区公所直接领导下开了一个大会。天气虽然很热，各村的翻身农民仍然带着兴奋的心情赶来参加。西戍一个王老汉说：“共产党是咱再生的爹娘，老人的生日怎能忘记？”会议一开始，全场严肃隆重的追悼了本基点在抗日战争与自卫战争中的死难的共产党员傅改锁等六同志。群众自动组织的八音会，吹打起哀乐来。东戍一个翻身农民拿手巾提着八个馍，捏着一朵花走向供桌前献上后说：“没有你们牺牲流血，咱们怎能翻身？这恩情我们忘不了”。接着由宋家庄政治主任张秀等六位共产党员公开介绍他们自己领导群众的斗争历史，要求群众多给以批评。西戍王有禄老汉说：“从前咱只知道共产党领导咱翻了身，可不知道共产党在那里，今天看到这些同志，才知道原来就是和咱在一起领导咱斗争翻身的同志。咱今后一定要跟着共产党员走，我要献花给共产党员同志，表示我的敬爱”。说着老汉把八朵大红花挂在台上六位党员的胸前。发言的人一个跟一个，东戍一个老实农民走上台说：“咱穷了一辈子，没有共产党，咱不会有今天，更不会在这台上，在人前说句气长话。今后不管生产、节约、渡荒、参战……我一定听共产党的话，跟共产党走”。
    最后分委书记陈同志讲话，除对三区党建设的历史加以概述外，并号召群众监督党，经常对党员提意见，号召党员群众合力同心克服浪费，注意节约，战胜旱荒。到会群众齐声响应，在高呼“党员群众团结起来战胜灾荒！”的口号声中散会。（范直）
