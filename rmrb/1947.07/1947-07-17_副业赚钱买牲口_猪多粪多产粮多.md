    [Report from our Jinnan office on the 15th] Liuwan Village in the Fourth District of Yuanchao is vigorously supporting agriculture with profits earned from sideline occupations, increasing the village's overall land yield by approximately 20%. Last December, the village organized two oil pressing cooperatives. Out of a total of 107 households, 86 participated in sideline production, earning over 2.5 million yuan in five months. To increase production, the masses used most of their sideline profits for agricultural production. The two oil presses purchased 23 head of livestock. Every household raises a fat pig, accumulating a lot of fertilizer. For example, Sun Zhanhao, who had been a worker his whole life, now raises a cow and a fat pig. Because of the increase in livestock, the farming is better, more manure is applied, and the crops in the fields are growing very well. It is estimated that this year's yield will be 20% higher than in previous years. The village closely integrates sideline occupations and agriculture. For example, grinding grain at night allows the livestock to plow the fields during the day. All those who participate in the oil press but do not raise livestock are lent livestock. Therefore, the masses in the village are full of confidence in achieving "cultivating three and saving one."
    [Report from our Jinnan office on the 15th] Yuanchao has overcome formalism, and mutual aid production has achieved significant success. In 1944 and 1945, Yuanchao simply emphasized organization, proposing "cooperation in every village, mutual assistance in every household." Leadership in production was simply circling around the issue of mutual aid, cooperation, and exchanging labor. For example, what kind of system for mutual aid and exchanging labor was there? How was labor calculated and exchanged? What new tricks were there? And some of the methods of mutual aid and exchanging labor were fixed, with boxes drawn for the masses to follow. The district and village were responsible for everything, neglecting to let the masses create their own methods from the perspective of increasing production. As this formalism developed, it became increasingly unsuitable for the various specific needs of the masses. The masses felt that participating in mutual aid not only imposed many restrictions, but also was less profitable than producing on their own. They gradually became indifferent to mutual aid production. As a result, most of the mutual aid groups collapsed at the end of the year, and the remaining ones were those that the masses voluntarily formed to increase production and set their own rules. Last summer's production inspection proposed measuring the merits of mutual aid and exchanging labor from the perspective of increasing production, and put forward three basic principles for mutual aid groups: first, there must be work to do, and surplus labor must have a place to be used; second, there must be profit, and participating in mutual aid must be more profitable than not participating; and third, it must be voluntary. This has played a considerable role in promoting production. For example, in Beilizhuang in the Second District, out of 170 households, 37 mutual aid groups were organized. Agriculture and sideline occupations were combined, and middle and poor peasants raised funds to buy livestock, benefiting both agriculture and sideline occupations.

    副业赚钱买牲口
    猪多粪多产粮多
    【本报冀南十五日电】元朝四区中刘万村，以副业获利大力支持农业，全村土地产量约可增加百分之二十。该村在去年腊月组织了两个打油合作社，全村共一百零七户，参加副业生产者达八十六户，经营五个月共获利二百五十多万元。为增加生产，群众将副业赢利大部用到农业生产上，两个油房添买牲口二十三头，每户都养着一只肥猪，积下很多肥料，如当了一辈子工的孙占豪，现在喂着一头牛，一个肥猪，因为牲口的增加，耕种的好，上的粪多，地里长的庄稼都很好，据估计，今年产量保证能比往年增加百分之二十。该村副业和农业密切结合着，如夜里推碾子，白天牲口犁地，凡是参加油房没喂牲口的，一概借给牲口，因此全村群众对实现耕三余一都充满着高度信心。
    【本报冀南十五日电】元朝克服形式主义，互助生产获得显著成就。元朝在四五年单纯强调组织起来，提出了“村村合作，家家互助”，领导生产上就是单纯在互助合作变工问题上打圈子，如互助变工的制度怎样，计工换工如何？有啥新的花样？并把部分互助变工的办法固定化，定出框子叫群众照样作，区村包办，忽视了从增产的目的上使群众自己创造办法。这种形式主义越发展和群众各种具体要求越不能适合，群众觉得参加互助不仅受许多限制，且不如自己生产获利多；就慢慢对生产互助冷淡下来，结果在年底大部互助组垮了台，存在的都是群众自愿结合为增加生产而自定规矩的互助组。去夏的生产检查，对互助变工，提出从增产效果衡量好坏，提出了互助组三个基本原则：第一是有活可干，组织起来，剩余劳力有处使用。第二是有利可图，参加互助比不互助获利多。第三是自愿结合。对生产起相当推动作用，如二区北里庄，全村一百七十户人家，组织了三十七个互助组，农副业结合，中贫农集资买牲口，农副业都获得利益。
