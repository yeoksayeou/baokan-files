　　Chiang Kai-shek's Another Huge Conspiracy
  　　Destroying the Changyuan Dike
  　　Plotting to Use the Yellow River Flood to Submerge the Liberated Areas
　　[Report from our newspaper in the JiluYu Region on the 8th] The north bank of the Yellow River's Changyuan section dike, from Yangxiaozhai to Daxinji, a 60-li section, has been repaired for 12 li under the leadership of the local democratic government despite the Kuomintang army's multiple obstructions and sabotage. As for the remaining 48 li, the Kuomintang side not only refuses to repair it, but also prohibits the masses from repairing it. Moreover, they dug four large breaches, each five meters long and eight meters wide, at the east end of Menggang ditch. Now that the flood season is approaching, a devastating flood is bound to occur once the floodwaters arrive.
　　[Report from our newspaper in the JiluYu Region on the 3rd] (Delayed) The Yellow River Committee of the JiluYu Liberated Area, in order to protest the Kuomintang's obstruction and sabotage of the Changyuan section of the dike, issued a circular telegram calling on righteous people around the world to stop the Kuomintang's crimes. The original telegram is as follows:
　　Chiang Kai-shek has long been plotting to use the return of the Yellow River to its old course to submerge the people of the liberated areas in order to achieve his military conspiracy. Despite numerous objections, the Kuomintang side has repeatedly concealed its tricks and has not stopped. The current criminal conspiracy to obstruct and sabotage the construction of the Changyuan Dike has exposed his cruel face without a trace. According to general common sense, after the Kuomintang side formulated the poisonous plan to flood the liberated areas, our people in the liberated areas, although aware of his treachery, still exercised forbearance and held three or four negotiations and made several appeals, hoping to remind the Chiang bandits to restore humanity and avoid creating a tragic case that would bring infamy for all time. According to general common sense, if the Chiang bandits had even a little humanity, they would know to cherish themselves and rein themselves in before it was too late. Who would have thought that the Chiang bandits would be cruel by nature and brazenly break the agreement to restore the dikes first and then block the breaches and release water? On the one hand, they used economic restrictions and aircraft strafing to sabotage the dike restoration project, and on the other hand, they strictly ordered the Huayuankou breach to be blocked and water released ahead of schedule. In addition to righteous indignation, the people of our liberated areas rose up to save themselves. Since last year, regardless of economic difficulties and military threats, they have still been rushing to repair the river dike from Dasuzhuang in Changyuan County to Shuiniu Zhaozhuang in Qihe County, which is more than 500 li long. From before and after the wheat harvest this year, they spent a total of 30 days, mobilizing 300,000 people every day to build the dike, requiring 1,500 cubic meters of earth, totaling more than 9 million workdays. Such a massive project was carried out after the post-war catastrophe and utter exhaustion. Fortunately, our people risked their lives and were finally able to overcome all difficulties and succeed. During the dike construction, from May 15th to June 24th, within 25 days (including 15 days of wheat harvesting when construction was suspended), Chiang Kai-shek's planes strafed and shelled across the river, and as many as 96 innocent people were killed. Chiang Kai-shek still felt unsatisfied, feeling regret that he had not been able to realize the flooding. Therefore, he used the occupation by the Kuomintang army to obstruct dike construction in Changyuan. In that section from Dasuzhuang to Daxinji, which is about 50 li long, the dike's soil has been eroded by wind and rain for the past ten years and is already dilapidated. In addition, near Menggang, the dikes had four blockade ditches dug by the Japanese invaders, each five zhang deep and eight zhang wide, which were not repaired. Furthermore, the people were strictly forbidden to repair the dikes themselves. The nearby people have repeatedly sent people to ask us to find a way to repair them, but due to the Kuomintang army's deliberate sabotage, it is impossible to proceed. Therefore, the Chiang bandits opened several breaches upstream of the Changyuan Yellow River dike, waiting for the great flood to come, so that the Yellow River water would surge out and turn the liberated areas into a vast swamp, watching as 7 million people perished in the fish's belly. The period of great flooding is approaching (less than 20 days), and 7 million people are facing the danger of being submerged, waiting for help. If the Chiang bandits have even one percent of humanity, (if the Kuomintang side repairs it, or allows the people to repair it, or allows us to repair it,) they can save 7 million people from death. We call on righteous people around the world to stem this tide, rise up together, and urge Chiang Kai-shek to quickly rein himself in before it is too late and repair the Changyuan Dike, so as to avoid causing a major tragedy. At the same time, we solemnly warn Chiang Kai-shek not to take such a vicious hand against the people. Otherwise, Chiang Kai-shek will be held responsible for the tragedy that results. This blood debt will be repaid with Chiang Kai-shek's blood, and the day when the people settle accounts with him will eventually come.

### 蒋介石又一巨大阴谋　破坏长垣大堤　图利用黄河伏泛淹没解放区

　　蒋介石又一巨大阴谋
  　破坏长垣大堤
  　图利用黄河伏泛淹没解放区
    【本报冀鲁豫八日电】黄河长垣段堤防，从杨小砦至大辛集六十华里的一段北岸堤，经当地民主政府在蒋军多方阻挠破坏下，已领导民众抢修完十二里。其余四十八里，蒋方不但不修，又不许群众抢修，而且在孟岗沟东头挖了五公尺长、八公尺宽的四个大缺口，现在已届伏泛期，一旦大水到来，必造成惨重水灾。
    【本报冀鲁豫三日电】（迟到）冀鲁豫解放区黄委会，为抗议蒋方阻挠并破坏长垣段大堤，通电呼吁世界正义人士，制止蒋方罪行，原电如下：
    蒋介石蓄意利用黄水归故，淹没解放区人民，以达其军事阴谋，为时已久；虽经多方反对，而蒋方一再掩饰其诡计，迄未停止。目前阻挠及破坏修筑长垣大堤之罪恶阴谋，更将其残忍面目暴露无遗。按自蒋方制订水淹解放区毒计后，我解放区人民，虽洞悉其奸，尤忍让再三、四次谈判、数度呼吁，以冀提醒蒋贼恢复人性，忽制造惨案，落万世骂名。按一般常识推断，蒋贼如稍有人性，当知自爱而悬崖勒马。孰意蒋贼残忍成性，悍然破坏先复堤而后堵口放水之协议，一方面用经济限制、飞机扫射破坏复堤工程，一方面严令花园口提前堵口放水。我解放区人民义愤之余，奋起自救，自去年迄今，不顾经济困难与军事威胁，仍将长垣县大苏庄到齐河县水牛赵庄长达五百余里的河堤，进行抢修，至今年麦收前后共用三十天时间，每天动员三十万人民修筑，需土一千五百方，计工九百余万。似此浩大工程，在战后浩劫、万分疲备下进行，幸我人民用命，终能克服万难而抵于成。在修堤中，自五月十五日至六月二十四日，二十五天内（中有十五天收麦停修），被蒋介石飞机扫射，隔河炮轰，人民无辜被害者竟达九十六人之多。而蒋介石尤感未足，以未能实现大水淹没为撼事，于是利用蒋军占领，在长垣阻挠修堤，该段自大苏庄至大辛集长约五十华里，堤身沙土经十年来风雨剥蚀，已残破不堪。又加孟岗附近堤，日寇挖有深一丈五尺宽二丈四尺的封锁沟四道，不予修补，并严禁人民自行修堤，附近人民屡次派人要求我们设法修通，但由于蒋军蓄意破坏，无法进行。于是蒋贼即在长垣黄河堤上游开了几个缺口，以待大泛之来，黄水汹涌而出，使解放区尽成泽国，坐视七百万人民葬身鱼腹。目前大泛之期蒋至（不到二十日），七百万人民面临没顶危险，伸手待援。蒋贼若稍有天良，拿出百分之一的人性，（蒋方修，或允许人民修，或让我们修。）可使七百万人民免于死难。我们呼吁世界正义人士，挽此狂澜，一致奋起，鞭策蒋介石迅速悬崖勒马，修复长垣大堤，以免造成大惨案。同时我们严正警告蒋介石，勿对人民下此毒手。否则由此发生之惨案，概由蒋介石负责。此等血债，要用蒋介石的血来还，人民与其清算之日，终会到来。　　　　冀鲁豫黄委会　七月三日
