Experience in Mass Movements in the Jilu Yu New District

(1) Launch the anti-traitor and revenge movement. During the enemy's occupation, in the areas we evacuated, landlords colluded with the enemy and puppets to seize land and grain, and to arrest and kill our activists. As a result, class relations in the countryside became more acute, arousing greater hatred among the peasants. After liberation, the masses universally demanded revenge, so we resolutely supported the masses in "moving the stone," suppressing the landlords. In a certain district of Gaoling, the enemy killed 101 of our activists. After the recovery, we immediately suppressed the principal murderers and the most heinous landlords who seized land and grain, and the revenge movement quickly unfolded. After the revenge movement in most villages, the masses' emotions were rekindled, thus opening the door to land reform. (2) Land redistribution is the peasants' urgent demand. In the beginning of the restored areas, cadres believed that the masses were "backward," "afraid of a change of regime," and "dared not take land." This was a wrong understanding, failing to see the active side of the masses. For example, the masses said: "It's better to be beaten to death than to starve to death. We are not afraid of death, but we are afraid of starvation." Although the masses initially dared not take land, this was because we had not led them to protect the fruits of their labor in the past. If we could show our determination to live and die with the masses, we would eliminate all the masses' concerns. When we recognized this demand of the masses, each county resolutely proposed the distribution of land and grain. After Gaoling proposed land redistribution, it also proposed land protection (i.e., holding the ground), so all the obstacles of the masses were removed, and they quickly took action. (3) Adhere to the position (the issue of land protection). On the basis of the initial distribution of land and grain, the peasants generated a demand for land protection, and the resolution of the land protection issue became the key to continuing to fully mobilize the masses and completely eliminate the landlords. After land redistribution opened up the situation in Gaoling, the masses dared not break openly with the landlords, so the struggle was not thorough, and the masses' land demands were not satisfied. They were afraid that we would not persevere and would not lead them to protect the fruits of their labor. After this, the leadership repeatedly raised the issue of persistence, held several peasant congresses, took oaths, made covenants, determined to stay the course, inserted grass as incense, and swore oaths by killing chickens. Then, it further implemented organizational clarification (clearing out landlords and puppet family members who had infiltrated peasant organizations). Village after village launched accusation and grievance struggles, and the masses were truly mobilized.

The general rule for fully mobilizing the masses in newly recovered areas of the Fourth Military Subdistrict is that the solution of the three issues of revenge, land redistribution, and persistence is indispensable. Where these three issues are well resolved, the masses are well mobilized; where they are resolved quickly, the progress is fast.

    复仇分田保田三者缺一不可
    冀鲁豫新区群运经验
    （一）开展反奸复仇运动。敌进占时期，我们撤退地区，地主勾搭敌伪进行倒地倒粮，捕杀我积极分子，因此农村阶级关系更尖锐，激起农民更大的仇恨。解放后群众普遍要求复仇，我们就坚决给群众撑腰“搬石头”，镇压地主。高陵某区敌人杀我积极分子一百零一人，收复后我们即对杀人主犯凶手和最坏倒地倒粮之恶霸地主实行镇压，复仇运动即迅速开展。大部村庄经过复仇以后，群众情绪重新高涨，因此打开了土改大门。（二）分田是农民迫切要求。在开始恢复的地区，干部认为群众“落后”“怕变天”“不敢要地”这是错误的认识，对群众积极面没有看到。如群众说：“打死比饿死强，咱死也不怕，就是怕挨饿”。虽然开始群众不敢要地，这是因为过去我们没有领导他们保护果实，假使我们能够表明与群众共生死的决心，就会扫除群众一切顾虑。当我们认识群众这一要求时，各县即坚决提出分田分粮。高陵提出分田后，又提出保田（即坚持阵地），所以群众一切障碍拔除，很快就动起来。（三）坚持阵地（保田问题），在初步分田分粮基础上，农民产生保田要求，而保田问题的解决又成为继续充分发动群众彻底消灭地主的关键。高陵分田打开局面之后，群众不敢与地主撕破脸，因此斗争不彻底，群众的土地要求亦不满足，怕我们不坚持，不领导他们保护果实。此后领导上就三番五次提出坚持问题，开了数次农民大会，宣誓立约，下定决心，插草为香，杀鸡宣誓，接着进一步实行澄清组织（清除混进农民组织内部之地主伪属），村村展开诉苦斗争，群众才真正大动起来。
    四分区新收复区充分发动群众，一般的规律是解决了复仇、分田、坚持三个问题，三者不可缺一，那里这三个问题解决的好，那里群众就发动的好；那里解决的快，那里就进行的快。
