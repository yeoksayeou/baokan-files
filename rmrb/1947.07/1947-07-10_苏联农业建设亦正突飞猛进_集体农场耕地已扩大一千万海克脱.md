Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 5th: Comprehensive report: Soviet post-war agricultural construction is advancing rapidly. There has been significant progress in agricultural production increase and welfare improvement. Soviet collective farmers have restored 70% to 80% of pre-war cultivated land area. This year, the cultivated land area of collective farms has expanded by 10 million hectares (one hectare equals 16 mu). Seven thousand power stations will be built in rural areas, and the number of electrified collective farms will increase to 30,000. The income and funds of collective farms will triple compared to pre-war levels. The output of the food industry will increase by 38% compared to last year. The number of beet sugar factories will increase from the current 145 to 816. Thirty-nine artificial milk factories will be built this year and next year. The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture has set a plan to irrigate 1.5 million hectares of wheat-growing areas. A 500,000-hectare irrigation network will be established in southern Ukraine. Livestock will increase by 5 million heads, an increase of 12% compared to last year. The spring sowing of grain has been completed in 24 regions and border areas across the country, with the wheat area exceeding last year's by more than 500,000 hectares. Compared to last year, cotton planting in Ukraine, Kuban, and the Caucasus has expanded threefold. Flax planting has restored pre-war production levels in three years. Vegetable planting has expanded the cultivated area by 11,400 hectares compared to last year. Abundant rainfall occurred across the country in May, and spring wheat seedlings are full, with a good harvest expected this year. Collective farmers across the country have written letters to Stalin, guaranteeing the increased production plan for this year's crops.
