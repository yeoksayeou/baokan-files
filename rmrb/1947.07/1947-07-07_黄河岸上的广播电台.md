Radio Station on the Banks of the Yellow River
	The village of ×× on the banks of the Yellow River in Jiyuan is less than half a mile across the river from × village in Mengjin on the opposite bank. The Yellow River divides them into two worlds. On the north bank, there is a radio station. When the river is calm, the farmers of ×× village often take the Xinhua Daily and, facing the opposite bank, broadcast the free and happy life in the liberated areas and the victorious news of our army to the people on the south bank. This news quickly spread to Luoyang and then to even more distant places.
	The "radio station" was initially built in this way: During the land reform in the village, the masses gave a portion of land to the family of the "running dog" Qu Chengde, which moved him greatly. One day, Qu Chengde's wife was walking along the riverbank with her twelve-year-old son Qu Li, when they suddenly saw a tall, thin person standing dejectedly on the opposite bank, lost in thought. Qu Li recognized his father, so his mother quickly shouted, "Li's father, the village has distributed land, the farmers' association is taking care of us, come back, it's alright!"
	Qu Chengde had colluded with the landlord during the anti-traitors and anti-bullies campaign and later fled to Henan to join Chiang's ×× team, deeply deceived and anesthetized by Chiang's diehards, making him doubt his wife's words. So he said, "That's not true, they're lying to you!" "It's absolutely true, let Li tell you!" "Dad, our family got three mu of land and a room, come back!" Qu Chengde returned as a result, and the "radio station" was established as a result.
	During the victory in southern Shanxi, the work of the "radio station" also became tense. As long as they saw someone on the opposite bank, they would broadcast, mainly to Chiang's soldiers, "Hey! The Eighth Route Army in southern Shanxi has won another great victory!" "Anything else?" "The Eighth Route Army in southern Shanxi has recovered more than a dozen counties including Jiangxian and Quwo... The Yuannan army has eliminated the Rapid Column." "Anything else?" "Yan'an has wiped out two brigades of Hu Zongnan."
	After that, it was like this every day. Sometimes in the middle of the night, Chiang's soldiers on the opposite bank would still ask, "Hey! Why isn't your radio station on yet?" (Taiyue Branch)

　　黄河岸上的广播电台
    济源黄河岸上的××村，和对岸孟津×村隔河一望不足半里，黄河把他们划分成两个世界。在河北岸有着一个广播电台，××村的农民常在河水静流的时候，拿上新华日报朝着对岸，把解放区的自由幸福的生活情形和我军胜利消息广播给南岸的人们听，这些消息很快地传到洛阳，又传到更远的地方。
    “广播台”开头是这样建设起来的，村土地改革时，群众给“狗腿”璩成德家属分了一部分地，使他很感动，一天璩成德的女人带着十二岁的儿子璩立走过河沿，忽见对岸有个细长个子的人，沮丧的立在那里若有所思，璩立眼明看出是他爸，他娘便连忙叫喊着：“立他爸，村里分了地了，农会照顾咱过来吧，没事”
    璩成德在反奸霸时，曾跟地主勾结，后来跑过河南投奔蒋记××队，深受蒋顽的欺骗麻醉，使他对于妻子的话也将信将疑，便说：“没有的事，人家哄你啦”。“一点不假，叫立儿说吧”！“爸，咱家分了三亩地，一间房，回来吧！”璩成德由此回来了，“广播电台”也由此设立起来。
    晋南大捷时，“广播电台”的工作也跟着紧张起来，只要望见对岸有人就广播起来，主要对象是蒋军士兵，“喂！晋南八路军又打了大胜仗”“还有吧？”晋南八路军收复绛县曲沃………十几个县，豫北消灭快速纵队”“还有吗？”“延安消灭胡宗南两个旅”。
    以后就每天如此，有时半夜对岸的蒋军还在问“喂！你们的广播电台怎么还不开呀”？（太岳分社）
