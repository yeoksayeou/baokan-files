Win Again and Again
Congratulating the Counter-Offensive Army on Three Victories

With a flurry of good news, our powerful field army on the Jilu Yu front has once again completed a great annihilation campaign in the southeast of Juye area within 50 hours from July 12th to 14th, wiping out two enemy reorganized divisions (minus one regiment). This is the third major victory for our Jinji-Luyu People's Liberation Army since launching the counter-offensive. In half a month, our army has galloped across the land, maneuvering and sweeping through the southwest of the Lu plains, successively eliminating six regular brigades and one regiment of the Kuomintang army, averaging more than one brigade every two days. The speed and scale of annihilation have far exceeded our expectations, creating a new record for mobile annihilation warfare by the Jinji-Luyu People's Liberation Army. From now on, the vast plains north of the Bianxu section of the Longhai Railway, west of the Jinpu Railway, and south of the Yellow River will undergo a complete transformation, and the war situation will take a sharp turn for the worse. The entire front of the Kuomintang army in the southwest of Lu has encountered a serious crisis.

After our army crossed the Yellow River and advanced deep into western Shandong, and a part of the East China Field Army launched an offensive on the Jinpu Railway, Chiang Kai-shek discovered a serious weakness in his strategic deployment: the emptiness on both sides of the Jinpu Railway, which would seriously threaten the left flank and rear of hundreds of thousands of troops on the East China battlefield. Chiang Kai-shek was forced to order three reorganized divisions, a total of six brigades, guarding the Longhai Railway and the northwest of Xuzhou to march north day and night, parallel to the Jinpu Railway, in an attempt to make up for this gap and carry out a detour to the Juye-Yuncheng area on our army's right flank. However, Chiang Kai-shek forgot that this was "advancing alone" and "a great taboo in military strategy." On the morning of July 13th, they began to realize the serious situation of being surrounded instead of successfully "detouring" in the southeast of Juye, but the realization came too late, and the vanguard of the two divisions were completely annihilated. Chiang Kai-shek also forgot another most serious problem, that is, the serious qualitative change that has taken place within the Kuomintang army. The combat effectiveness of the same unit has undergone significant changes a year ago and half a year ago; the changes after our army's counter-offensive half a year ago have been even more drastic. The Kuomintang army's will to fight has declined unprecedentedly, and it has generally lost confidence in combat, so that it cannot but quickly lay down its weapons in battle. For example, in the Yuncheng campaign, the Kuomintang army had already started preparing tunnels for escape 20 days before I attacked Yuncheng. This time, a few senior officers of the Kuomintang army's 55th Division escaped from the tunnels, which shows that they had no confidence in holding on for a long time. Therefore, I can fully wipe out its two brigades with just one corps. In the Battle of Dingtao, all more than 4,000 enemy soldiers of the 153rd Brigade were captured, and our casualties were only more than 300, with a ratio of fourteen to one. In the Battle of Juye, our army annihilated the vanguard of the two reorganized divisions of the Kuomintang army, taking only two days and two nights. This situation was rare in the past, but it will continue to develop widely in the future. This is the inevitable result of the Kuomintang army's continuous defeats and increasingly worse performance.

At present, Chiang Kai-shek's most serious difficulties on the Jinji-Luyu front are: insufficient troops and weak troops. After the two reorganized divisions of the Kuomintang army were wiped out, its follow-up 66th Division was trapped on Yangshan Mountain northwest of Jinxiang, unable to advance or retreat. The only mobile force that can be drawn out is the 58th Division of the Yunnan Army, which has been heavily damaged by the continuous attacks of our Yuwan-Su People's Liberation Army, and is gathering in the Jinxiang and Shanxian areas, daring not to advance. There is also the 3rd Division, which was reorganized after being wiped out last September and never dared to be used on the front line, now guarding the Longhai Railway. The remnants of Liu Ruming's troops are stubbornly guarding the line from Heze to Lanfeng and Kaifeng, terrified and holed up. In addition, Chiang also airlifted the 106th Brigade of the 40th Division from Anyang to Kaifeng, and transferred a brigade of the 52nd Division from Wuhan to the Minquan and Shangqiu areas to strengthen the defense of the Longhai Railway.

This shows that Chiang Kai-shek is doing everything possible to transfer troops from other battlefields, adopting the method of robbing Peter to pay Paul. Even if it is just a brigade, or a tattered one that never dares to be used on the front line, he puts them all together and uses them all on the Jinji-Luyu front. However, with such a vast front line, it is difficult for Chiang Kai-shek to achieve anything by relying on these troops. Because: first, the crisis on the Jinpu Railway of the Kuomintang army continues to deepen. The entire section from Jinan to Xuzhou is under the serious threat of the People's Liberation Army, and drastic changes are also taking place in the East China war situation; second, the Kuomintang army's defense line on the Longhai Railway is still extremely fragile; third, the crises in all the areas emptied by the Kuomintang army are becoming more profound. Henan North, Shanxi South and Yuwan-Su areas are the most obvious. As long as we can continue to inflict several annihilation blows of a similar nature on the Kuomintang army, especially its direct line backbone, on the Jinji-Luyu front, then the entire Jinji-Luyu front of the Kuomintang army may accelerate its collapse. Frontline heroic soldiers! We must make persistent efforts and fight to realize this glorious task!

The great victory in southwest Shandong is due to the unprecedented growth of the people's strength, in addition to the reasons for the decline in the Kuomintang army's combat effectiveness and the shortage of troops. Generally speaking, there are two issues: the land reform of the peasants and the mass line of the army. Because our region has unyieldingly adhered to the implementation of land reform and boldly mobilized the masses over the years, especially the Jilu Yu region insisted on carrying out a large-scale land reform movement this spring in the midst of serious war, which has made the people's strength unprecedentedly strong, and the broad masses of the people have enthusiastically participated in the war. In particular, the great work of completing the enlistment of 100,000 liberated peasants at one time in April this year, which exceeded the scheduled plan by more than doubled, has enabled our expeditionary corps to be generally fully manned, becoming the basic living force for our current victory over the enemy. In the work of the troops, the mass line has been universally implemented over the years, which has made the enthusiasm of commanders and fighters unprecedentedly high, the wisdom of the masses has been universally brought into play, and all the work of the troops, especially combat effectiveness, has been able to advance by leaps and bounds. This time, before the great counter-offensive, each corps carried out mass political mobilization from bottom to top, universally set off a high tide of thought for the great counter-offensive, further strengthened the victorious confidence of all commanders and fighters, and widely launched the counter-offensive meritorious service movement, the learning and remembering well movement, and the heated training movement on this basis. Therefore, each corps showed unprecedented tenacity and combat enthusiasm as soon as it entered the counter-offensive. The achievements of a certain corps in Yuncheng are the best proof. The above two points are extremely valuable experiences in our region, and they must be universally implemented in the entire region. At present, the development in various regions and various troops is still uneven, and we must learn from the advanced and in-depth and strive to move towards balance quickly. In particular, we must check whether we are satisfied with the results of land reform, fail to conduct in-depth re-examination, and stop the mass line on the lips. If so, we must correct it. We should take whether the masses are fully mobilized and whether the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses are truly improved as the standard of inspection. If we do these two things in a down-to-earth manner, we can continue to win the complete victory of the counter-offensive!

In our victory, we must also prevent pride at all times, pride is our most fatal enemy. We can turn danger into safety and achieve victory in arduous struggles and critical situations; we must learn to be calm, sober, not impatient, conscientious, prudent and humble in victory; the more humble we are, the more victories we will win, and the more victories we win, the more humble we must be. This is also a very important experience in our year of self-defense war. To this end, we must clearly establish the concept of a long-term war, prevent the theory of quick victory; we must work with peace of mind, refrain from empty talk about victory, and relax the current struggle; we must strengthen the work in the rear, independently and autonomously adhere to the struggle in the edge areas of the occupied areas, eliminate all concepts of simply relying on the main force to win battles, in order to accelerate the victory of the counter-offensive!

### 胜了再胜　祝反攻大军三捷

　　胜了再胜
  　祝反攻大军三捷
    捷报纷飞，冀鲁豫前线我强大野战军，自七月十二日至十四日，五十小时内于钜野东南地区，再次完成伟大的歼灭作战，一次歼灭敌两个整编师（缺一个团）这是我晋冀鲁豫人民解放军出师反攻以来第三次大捷。半月之中，我军纵横奔驰，辗转机动，席卷鲁西南大平原，已连歼蒋军正规军六个整旅及一个整团，平均两天多歼敌一个旅；其歼敌之速与歼敌之多，均远远超过我人之预期，创造晋冀鲁豫人民解放军机动歼灭战之新纪录。自此陇海线汴徐段以北，津浦线以西，黄河以南广大平原，局面为之完全改观，战局将急转直下，蒋军在鲁西南地区整个战线已遭遇严重危机。
    我大军飞越黄河，深入鲁西，及华东野战军一部在津浦线发动攻势以后，蒋介石发现了他战略部署上的严重弱点：津浦线两侧的空虚，这将严重威胁其在华东战场数十万军队的左翼及后方，蒋介石被迫以其防卫陇海线及徐州西北之三个整编师共六个旅，星夜兼程，自单县、金乡与津浦线平行北进，企图弥补这一缺口，并向我军右翼钜郓地区实行迂回；但蒋介石忘了这是“孤军深入”和“兵家大忌”。七月十三日上午，他们在钜野东南已开始发现自己“迂回”未成反陷入重围的严重形势，但发现的时间已过迟，终至先头两个师全部被歼。蒋介石还忘记另一个最严重的问题，即蒋军内部发生的严重的质变，此同一部队，其战斗力，一年以前与半年前发生着显著变化；半年前与我军反攻后变化更是十分剧烈，蒋军战斗意志已空前下降，普遍丧失战斗信心，以致在战斗中不能不迅速放下武器。例如：郓城战役，蒋军早在我攻击郓城前二十天已开始准备逃跑的地道，此次蒋军五十五师少数高级军官即从地道逃跑，足见其早无坚守信心，故我以一个兵团即能充裕歼其两个旅；定陶之战，俘敌一五三旅全部四千余人，我仅伤亡三百余人，其比例为十四比一；钜野之战，我军歼蒋先头两个整编师，费时仅两昼夜。这种情况，在过去是不多的，今后必将继续普遍发展，这是蒋军连战连败，愈战愈败后必然结果。
    现蒋介石在冀鲁豫前线的最严重困难是：兵力不足和兵力不强，蒋军两个整编师被歼后，其后续之六十六师困守金乡西北之羊山进退不得，现所能抽出聊作机动的仅有滇军整五十八师，集结金乡、单县地区不敢前进，该师曾遭受我豫皖苏人民解放军不断打击，损失甚重；其余尚有整三师，去年九月被歼后重编，从不敢用于第一线，现守备陇海线；刘汝明残部则固守菏泽至兰封、开封之线，丧魂落魄，闭门不出；此外，蒋又自安阳空运四十师一○六旅至开封，及增调武汉之整五十二师一个旅至民权、商邱地区，以强化陇海线守备。
    这说明蒋介石正在竭尽一切可能，从其它战场抽调部队，实行拆东墙补西墙的办法，即使是一个旅也好，是破烂不堪从不敢用于第一线的也好，东凑西拚，统统用到冀鲁豫前线来了。但战线如此辽阔，蒋介石企图依靠这些部队来解决什么问题，是难能奏效的。因为：第一、蒋军津浦线的危机继续加深，从济南到徐州段整个都处于人民解放军严重威胁中，华东战局亦正发生剧烈变化；第二、蒋军在陇海线的防线仍极脆弱；第三、在一切蒋军抽空了的地区，危机更加深刻化。豫北、晋南和豫皖苏地区表现得最为明显，只要我们在冀鲁豫前线能够继续予蒋军特别是其嫡系骨干几个类似性质的歼灭打击，则蒋军冀鲁豫整个战线即可能加速崩溃。前线英勇的将士们！我们必须再接再厉，为实现这一光荣任务而斗争！
    鲁西南的大捷，除了蒋军战力降低，兵力不足的原因以外，更主要由于人民力量空前壮大所致。总起来说，是两个问题：农民的土地改革和军队的群众路线。由于我区年来不屈不挠，坚持贯彻土地改革，放手发动群众，特别冀鲁豫区在严重战争中，今春坚持进行了大规模土地改革运动，使人民力量空前壮大，广大人民踊跃参战。特别是在今年四月一次完成了十万翻身农民参军的伟大工作，超过预定计划一倍以上，使我出征兵团普遍获得满员，成为我们当前克敌致胜的基本有生力量。在部队工作上，年来普遍实行群众路线，使指战员积极性空前提高，群众的智慧普遍发挥，部队各项工作特别战斗力均能突飞猛进。此次大反攻，事先各兵团进行了自下而上的群众性政治动员，普遍掀起了大反攻思想高潮，进一步坚定了全体指战员的胜利信心，并在这一基础上广泛开展了反攻立功运动，和学好记好运动，以及热火朝天的练兵运动，所以各兵团一经进入反攻，即表现出空前的顽强性与战斗热情。某兵团在郓城的战绩，即是最好的证明。以上两条是我区极宝贵的经验，必须在全区继续普遍贯彻。目前各个地区，各个部队，在发展上仍是不平衡的，必须向先进的深入的看齐，以争取迅速走向平衡。尤其要检查我们是否有满足于土地改革成绩，不深入复查，及将群众路线停止在口头上的现象，有则必须纠正。我们应以群众是否充分发动，群众积极性创造性是否真正提高，作为检查的标准。切切实实作好这两件事，我们就能继续争取反攻彻底胜利！
    在我们的胜利中，还要随时防止骄傲，骄傲是我们最致命的敌人。我们能够在艰苦斗争危急情况中转危为安，取得胜利；我们更必须在胜利中学会镇静，清醒，毫不急燥，兢兢业业，谨慎谦虚，胜了再胜愈谦虚愈胜利，愈胜利愈须谦虚。这一条也是我们一年自卫战争中极重要的经验。为此我们必须明确树立长期战争观念，防止速胜论；必须安心工作，切戒空谈胜利，松懈当前斗争；必须加强后方工作，独立自主的坚持沦陷区边沿区斗争，肃清一切单纯依靠主力打胜仗的观念，以加速反攻的胜利！
