　　Re-emphasizing the Rush to Plant and Replant!
    In recent days, there has been widespread rainfall in various areas, and many places have been thoroughly soaked. After the rain, a blitz of planting and replanting is the most important and urgent task at hand to overcome the disaster. Our Party, government, military, and civilian cadres must seize this precious moment and take urgent action, using maximum effort to lead and organize the masses to carry out planting and replanting without any further delay. To this end, we must:
    1. Persuade the masses that planting something is better than planting nothing, and planting one seedling counts as one seedling. Currently, many "sandy dry lands" and wheat stubble fields in our area have not been planted. Some have been planted but lack sufficient seedlings, or have been completely destroyed by hail or locusts. Some people are experiencing emotional fluctuations. We must properly persuade them to plant late-season crops and short-cycle crops, and those lacking seedlings should immediately replant, promoting the spirit of "man will conquer nature."
    2. Rushing to plant and replant is a blitz-like task. Hesitation and missed opportunities will result in irreparable losses. Areas with less rainfall or no rainfall must also be planted quickly. We must break the paralyzing and wishful thinking of "waiting for more rain before planting." We have already seen many places suffer greatly due to the leadership's paralysis, where they failed to plant after three or four fingers of rain. However, there are also many counties where the leaders led the masses to seize the opportunity to plant during light rains, and if it didn't rain, they prepared the land in advance, dug the holes, and plowed the fields, planting immediately when the rain came. This spirit of "being prepared" is worthy of emulation by all regions.
    3. In leading and organizing manpower, we must regard the complete fulfillment of this planting and replanting task as a serious political mission, putting in all our efforts to do it conscientiously. Cadres at the county, district, and village levels should promote the spirit of meritorious service to the people, actively leading and organizing the masses to rush to plant and replant, and promote the work through methods of commendation and modeling. Old areas with organizational experience can implement full-village large-scale labor exchanges, organizing men, women, the old, and the young. New areas lacking organizational experience or with insufficient experience can organize temporary mutual aid on a large scale. In short, the sooner the better: "Planting one day early yields one stone, planting one day late halves the yield." Local organs and troops should also extract as much manpower and animal power as possible to help the masses.
    4. Continue to implement thrift education. Do not relax thrift efforts simply because there has been some rain and think that "the disaster is over" or "it doesn't matter anymore!" It is almost certain that this year's harvest will be reduced. In conjunction with the arrival of the great counter-offensive, we should educate the masses to accumulate strength and defeat Chiang Kai-shek.

### 再论突击抢种补种！

　　再论突击抢种补种！
    日来各区较普遍的落了雨，不少地方已经下透。雨后突击抢种、补种，是当前战胜灾荒头等重要迫切的工作。我党政军民干部，应抓紧这千金一刻的时机，紧急行动起来，用最大力量领导与组织群众，进行抢种补种，丝毫不能再迟缓了。为此，我们必须：
    一、说服群众种一点比不种强，种一棵算一棵。目前我区尚有很多“沙旱地”、麦茬地都未种上，有的虽已种上而不够苗或遭冰雹或蝗蝻打光吃光。某些群众情绪发生振荡，我们要好好说服他们种晚庄稼，种小日月庄稼；不够苗的要马上补种，发扬“人定胜天”的精神。
    二、抢种补种是突击性的工作，犹豫不决，错过时机，就会造成无法补救的损失。雨量少的地区，或没有落雨的地区，亦必须赶快种上。必须打破“等等再多下些雨再种吧”的麻痹侥幸思想。我们已有好多地方由于领导上的麻痹，下了三、四指雨而未种上地，吃了大亏。但也有很多县份，雨下的少时，领导群众趁雨抢种，不下雨，先把地弄好，剜好了窑，翻好了地，一下雨即刻种上。这种“未雨绸缪”的精神，值得各地效法。
    三、在领导与组织人力方面，必须把真正完成这次抢种补种工作，看成一种严重的政治任务，拿出全部力量认真去做，县、区、村各级干部，发扬为民立功精神，积极领导与组织群众抢种补种，用表功表模的方法推动工作。有组织经验的老区，可以全村大变工，把男女老少都组织起来，缺乏组织经验或经验不足的新区，可大量组织临时互助。总之，越快越好，“早种一天打一石，晚种一天减一半”。驻地机关部队，亦要尽量抽出人力、畜力，帮助群众。
    四、继续贯彻节约教育，千万不要因为下了一些雨，认为“灾荒过去了”“不要紧了！”而把节约工作放松。今年年成减收可以说是肯定了，更应结合大反攻的到来，教育群众积蓄后劲，把蒋介石打垮。
