    【This newspaper's dispatch】 In Xiyang's Sixth District, the millet seedlings have mostly been tended to, and the second weeding of miscellaneous fields is underway. Most of this work is being done by women, freeing up male labor to plant buckwheat and reclaim wasteland. The district has already reclaimed over forty mu of land, and has organized surplus labor to transport and sell labor, and to dig up medicinal herbs. In the Eighth District, miscellaneous fields have generally been weeded once, and some villages have completed the second weeding. Most millet fields have been weeded once, with some villages having weeded two-thirds of them, and are currently planting buckwheat. Recently, there has been some rain in various areas, and the masses are preparing seeds to quickly replant late seedlings and vegetables.

    昔阳突击种菜
    【本报讯】昔阳六区谷苗已大部挽完，正在开始锄第二锄杂田。大部是妇女干的，节省了男劳力种莜麦、开荒，现全区已开四十余亩，并组织了剩余劳力运输卖工、刨药。八区杂田已普锄一次，部分村二次已锄完。谷田大部锄完一次，个别村有锄三分之二的，正在种莜麦。最近各地均落了些雨，群众正准备种子突击补种晚苗及蔬菜等。
