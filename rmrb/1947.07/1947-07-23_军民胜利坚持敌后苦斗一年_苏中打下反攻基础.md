Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 20th. A comprehensive report from a Central Jiangsu branch reporter: The victorious year of persistence by the military and civilians in Central Jiangsu began in mid-July of last year when Chiang's troops launched a massive offensive against the Central Jiangsu Liberated Area. After the Central China Field Army completed seven battles with seven victories in Central Jiangsu in the first three months, the main force moved north, and most of Central Jiangsu was under Chiang's control. Over the past eight or nine months, Chiang's army has implemented a joint offensive from military, political, economic, and cultural aspects, attempting to fundamentally destroy the Central Jiangsu Liberated Area and realize its delusional attempt to "control northern Jiangsu (Note: referring to the area north of the Yangtze River, including Central Jiangsu) and consolidate Nanjing and Shanghai," through blockhouses, small-scale divisions, "sweeping," encirclements, repeated "mopping-up" operations, and the organization of puppet bandits and secret agents. However, as a result of the united and determined struggle of the entire military and civilians in Central Jiangsu over the past year, Chiang's dream has finally been shattered, the rear area position has been maintained, and a strong foundation for welcoming the counteroffensive has been laid. This can be demonstrated by the following major signs: First, the armed struggle has been victoriously maintained. Over the past year, the People's Liberation Army and local armed forces at all levels in Central Jiangsu have annihilated more than 30,000 enemy soldiers and disintegrated thousands of Chiang's puppet troops. Second, mass struggles, such as anti-burning, anti-killing, anti-looting, anti-conscription, anti-Baosjia system, and anti-"surrender" struggles, have been launched everywhere. Struggles such as delaying donations, defaulting on donations, demonstrations, reasoning petitions, and accusations have also been widely carried out in the Chiang-occupied areas. Regarding emptying houses and clearing the fields, there was the large-scale relocation of 100,000 people in the Xin Jie district of Taixing; regarding transforming the terrain, there was the large-scale destruction of roads and construction of large and small dams by 300,000 people in Dong (Gao), Hai (men), and Qi (dong); regarding sniping at the enemy, there was the sharpshooter sniping movement in Rudong; regarding harassing the enemy, there was the "maze" movement of more than 30,000 people in Rudong, etc. Support for the front lines often involved tens of thousands of people. Turning-over peasants poured into the main force, with statistics reaching more than 30,000 people in the autumn month alone. Third, the land reform is particularly characteristic: in the guerrilla environment behind enemy lines, a fiery peasant emancipation movement was launched. On the one hand, it was necessary to fight against the reactionary armed forces of landlords such as Chiang Kai-shek, and on the other hand, it was necessary to carry out complex and arduous struggles against the local feudal evil forces, striving for both speed and fairness, thus creating many experiences. During the period of supporting the front lines, various division of labor methods were adopted, such as village A setting off to support the front, while village B distributed land; setting off one day to support the front, and returning the next day to settle accounts; men going out to carry stretchers, while women divided the land at home. During the Chiang-controlled guerrilla warfare, one hand held a gun and the other held an abacus, fighting guerrillas while distributing fields. In organizational combination, the land distribution team was the armed work team, and the emancipation team became the land protection team. In the Chiang-occupied areas, secret land distribution was carried out, with the masses swearing oaths to implement the method of unorganized swarming to distribute land and grain, so that the evil landlords could not find targets for revenge. When landlords fled, they set up strongholds, copied the landlords' red deeds, or intercepted red deeds en route, distributing them to the masses to burn. In areas dominated by the enemy, the peasants were organized to launch anti-seizure of land and anti-rent collection struggles against the landlords, suppressing the ringleaders of the evil bullies and warning the general landlords, so that they were intimidated and did not dare to act rashly. After the above-mentioned struggles, the feudal forces were basically destroyed throughout Central Jiangsu, and the goal of "land to the tillers" was achieved. The significance of the great victory of the patriotic self-defense struggle of the military and civilians in Central Jiangsu is extremely significant. Not only has it held up more than 50,000 enemy troops to date, powerfully cooperating with the main battlefield, but it has also encouraged the democratic movement of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas, providing a lot of experience for the persistence of the anti-Japanese struggle in various liberated areas, proving that the people in any Chiang-occupied area can persist in the struggle and achieve victory. The full-scale counteroffensive is coming soon, and the result of the hard work of the military and civilians in Central Jiangsu on their own farmland for a year with blood and sweat will soon be fully harvested.

### 军民胜利坚持敌后苦斗一年　苏中打下反攻基础

　　军民胜利坚持敌后苦斗一年
  　苏中打下反攻基础
    【新华社华中二十日电】苏中分社记者综述：苏中军民胜利坚持的一年称从去年七月中旬蒋军大举进攻苏中解放区，华中野战军于头三个月内在苏中完成七战七捷后，主力北上，苏中大部地区即处于蒋后。八九个月来，蒋军从碉堡封锁、小块分割，“扫荡”、合击、反复“清剿”，组织伪匪特务，从军事、政治、经济、文化各方面实行联合进攻，以期根本摧毁苏中解放区，实现其所谓“控制苏北（按：指长江以北，包括苏中）巩固京沪”的狂妄企图。但是一年来，苏中全体军民团结一致决死苦斗的结果，终于粉碎了蒋贼的迷梦，坚持了敌后阵地，打下了迎接反攻的强固基础。这有下列主要标帜可资证明：首先是胜利地坚持了武装斗争，一年来，苏中人民解放军和各级地方武装共歼敌三万余人，瓦解蒋伪达数千人。第二是群众斗争，反烧杀、反抢掠、反抓丁、反保甲、反“自首”的斗争，到处掀起。而拖捐、赖捐、示威游行、说理请愿、控告等斗争，在蒋占区也已普遍开展。论空舍清野，则有如泰兴新街区十万人的大搬家；改造地形，则有如（皋）东，海（门）启（东）三十万人大破路，打大坝造小坝；狙击敌人，则有如东的神枪狙击运动；困扰敌人，则有如东三万余人的“迷魂阵”运动等。支援前线，动辄以十数万计。翻身农民涌入主力，仅去秋一个月统计即达三万余人。第三是土地改革，尤具特色：在敌后游击环境下，掀起如火如荼的农民翻身运动，一面要与蒋介石等大地主的反动武装作战，一面又要跟本地封建恶势力进行复杂艰苦的斗争，既力求其快，又要力求其平，因而创造了许多经验。在支援前线时期，则采取各种分工办法，如甲乡出发支前，乙乡则分土地；前一天出发支前，后一天回来算帐；男人出外抬担架，女人就在家划地界。蒋后游击时，则一手拿枪，一手拿算盘；边游击，边分田。在组织上的结合，则是分田队即是武工队，翻身队变为保田队。在蒋占区，则进行机密分田，群众相约发誓，实行无组织形式的一窝蜂似的分田倒粮办法，使恶霸地主找不到报复对象。地主逃亡就扎下据点抄出地主红契，或中途截获红契，分发群众烧毁。在敌占优势地区，则组织农民对地主展开反夺田、反收租斗争，镇压恶霸头子，警告一般地主，使其震慑而不敢妄动。经过上述种种斗争，全苏中基本上摧毁了封建势力，达到了耕者有其田的目的。苏中军民坚持爱国自卫斗争获得伟大胜利的意义，是极其重大的。不仅是至今还拖住了敌人五万以上的兵力，有力地配合了正面战场，而且鼓舞了蒋管区人民的民主运动，对各解放区坚持敌后斗争，提供了不少经验，证明任何蒋占地区人民都能坚持斗争并取得胜利。全面大反攻快要到来了，苏中军民用血汗在自己田园上辛苦耕种一年的结果，行将获得丰满的收获。
