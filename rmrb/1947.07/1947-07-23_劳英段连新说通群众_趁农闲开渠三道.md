　　Labor Hero Duan Lianxin Persuades the Masses
  　Taking Advantage of the Slack Season to Dig Three Channels
    [This newspaper, Xiyang News] Xiyang first-class Labor Hero Duan Lianxin, since moving from Yundai to Heshang this February, saw that the village had flowing water and the conditions to build irrigated land, but the masses had no habit of building irrigated land over the years. After planting, due to the drought, Lao Duan conducted in-depth investigations and found that Shen Qili had built three fen of irrigated land last year, growing rice and producing five big dou of grain. He seized on this specific fact, let the masses discuss it, made benefit calculations, and also discussed the drought, explaining that even if it didn't rain, the irrigated land would still produce grain, and after harvesting the rice, wheat could also be planted. Opening up irrigated land could prevent drought and survive famine. In this way, he cleared the masses' thinking, and taking advantage of the slack season, in twelve days, with 150 workdays, he dug three channels and built fifteen mu of rice fields, and proposed that in July, during the agricultural slack season, they should continue to build.
    [Another News] When Wangzhai Village showed signs of drought, the cadres immediately led the masses to discuss, recalling the suffering of the masses during the 1943 famine, and recognizing the severity of the drought. And cadres such as Gao Jinyi, Zhang Wanchang, and Gao Jin'er came up with drought prevention methods. The whole village established a Drought Prevention and Famine Preparation Committee. After planting, they organized ninety-two laborers to dig channels, using two hundred and seventy workdays, turning thirty-seven mu of dry land into irrigated land. The masses were very happy.

　　劳英段连新说通群众
  　趁农闲开渠三道
    【本报昔阳讯】昔阳一等劳英段连新，自从今年二月由云岱搬到河上后，看到该村有活水，有修水地的条件，但群众历年来没有修水地的习惯。在下种后由于天旱，老段即深入了解，发现申起立去年修了三分水地，种稻产粮五大斗，它便抓住了这个具体事实，让群众讨论，作了利益计算，又拿天旱进行讨论，说明天不下雨水地照样打粮食，收了稻还能种麦，开下水地能防旱渡荒，这样打通了群众思想，趁农闲空隙，十二天用工一百五十个，开渠三道，修稻地十五亩，并提出七月农闲还要继续修。
    【又讯】王寨村在呈现旱象之时，干部即领导群众进行讨论，从回忆四三年灾荒时群众的痛苦，认识了旱象的严重性。并有干部高近义、张万昌、高金小等想出防旱办法，全村成立了一个防旱备荒委员会，下种后组织了劳力九十二人进行开渠，用工二百七十个，把三十七亩旱地变成水地，群众很高兴。（新颖）
