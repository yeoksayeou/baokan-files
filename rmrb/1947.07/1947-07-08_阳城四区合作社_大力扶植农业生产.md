　　Yangcheng Fourth District Cooperative
  　Vigorously Supports Agricultural Production
    [Our newspaper's Taiyue 6th dispatch] The 25 village cooperatives and one credit cooperative in Yangcheng Fourth District, focusing on agriculture, have achieved great success in supporting mass production. 1. Helping farmers solve fertilizer difficulties through donations, temporary loans, and cheap sales. Cooperatives throughout the district donated 2,900 dan of animal manure to farmers, and sold more than 16,000 pieces of bean cake, worth more than 2.2 million yuan, to newly liberated farmers at 40 percent of the market price. The Houjing cooperative alone lent 110 pieces of bean cake, enough to fertilize 3,000 mu of land. 2. Improving varieties and regulating seeds. A total of more than 3,000 jin of seeds were regulated. The Houjing Village cooperative lent 1,100 jin, 1.5 dou of hemp seeds, and 8.8 dou of sesame, and selected two shi of the best varieties for promotion. In order to improve the soybean variety in the area, the Yanli Village Cooperative specially bought 6 dou of soybean seeds from Fushan. 3. Supplying 332 ploughshares at a fair price, 273 spades, 160 hoes, as well as manure forks, adzes, plows, carrying poles, manure buckets, etc. 4. During the busy spring plowing season, cooperatives in various villages stopped transportation to help the masses with spring plowing, plowing and planting a total of 557 mu. The district federation of cooperatives especially helped military families without labor by plowing 168 mu of land. 5. Credit loans. The district federation of cooperatives issued agricultural loans of 3.4 million yuan. The Yanli Village Credit Cooperative issued livestock loans of 572,000 yuan and agricultural production loans of 111,000 yuan. The main reasons for the success are, first of all, clarifying that the task of rural cooperatives is mainly to organize mass agricultural production. For example, if the staff of the Baijian Village Cooperative do not invest in agricultural production, they will not get the support of the masses and the business will not be developed. Secondly, launching a merit campaign for cooperative staff, thinking of ways for the masses, giving ideas, and specifically solving the difficulties of the masses in farming. For example, the Yanli Credit Cooperative investigated that the village lacked livestock, so it tried to buy eight oxen and sell them to farmers at the original price. The Xianyi Village Cooperative mobilized its staff to stand in for farmers during the busy spring plowing season, saving 120 labor days, which were all supported by the masses.

　　阳城四区合作社
  　大力扶植农业生产
    【本报太岳六日电】阳城四区二十五个村合作社与一个信用合作社以农业为主，扶植群众生产，获得很大成绩。一、以奉送、暂借、贱卖等帮助农户解决肥料困难，全区合作社奉送农民畜粪二千九百担，并把价值二百廿余万元的豆饼一万六千余块按市价百分之四十卖给新翻身农民。仅侯井合作社便借出豆饼一百一十块，共可施地三千亩。二、改良品种，调剂种子。共计调剂种籽三千余斤，仅侯井村合作社借出者有一千一百斤，麻籽一石五升，芝麻八斗八升，并挑选最优良品种两石推广。演礼村合作社为了改良该地大豆品种，特到浮山买回大豆籽六斗。三、平价供应犁铧三百三十二件。铣二百七十三张。锄一百六十张及粪钗、钁、犁、扁担、粪桶等。四、在春耕紧张时，各村合作社均停止运输，帮助群众春耕，共犁种五百五十七亩。区联社特别帮助无劳力军属犁地一百六十八亩。五、信用贷款。经区联社贷出者有农业贷款三百四十万元。经演礼村信用社贷出者有牲畜贷款五十七万二千元。农业生产贷款十一万一千元。获得成绩的主要原因，首先明确了农村合作社的任务，主要是组织群众农业生产。如白涧村合作社职员不投入农业生产，即得不到群众拥护。业务也不发达。其次开展合作社职员立功运动，为群众想办法，出主意，具体解决群众耕种困难。如演礼信用社调查该村缺乏牲畜就设法买耕牛八头，照原价卖给农民。献义村合作社在春耕紧张时，动员职员代农民支差，省工一百二十个，都获得群众拥护。
