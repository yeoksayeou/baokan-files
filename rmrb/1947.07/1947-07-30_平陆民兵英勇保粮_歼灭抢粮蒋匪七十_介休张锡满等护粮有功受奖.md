Xinhua News Agency, Jinjiluyu, 28th: (Delayed dispatch) The Pinglu militia completely annihilated 70 men including the Chiang Kai-shek county magistrate. Du Caishi, the Chiang Kai-shek Pinglu county magistrate who fled to Shanzhou, led his county government's special service company of 70 men on the evening of the 18th of last month, secretly crossing the Yellow River from the Checun ferry, attacking Changle Town in Pinglu to loot wildly, seizing more than 7,000 catties of wheat, more than 300 catties of salt, 40 donkeys and many other properties. They also extorted 70 million yuan from Checun and Changle villages, demanding it be paid within two days. Upon hearing the news, more than 50 militiamen from the county gathered and surrounded Changle on the 21st, attacking from two directions. The stubborn enemy fled in a panic to the river bank. Chiang's army on the south bank responded with artillery and machine guns. Our militia fought bravely, and by 2 p.m., the enemy fled in a panic, taking oil packets and small boats. As they crossed the river, our militia concentrated fire and suddenly fired fiercely, sinking all their oil packet boats, and the enemy was completely destroyed. The militia captured three enemies and recovered all the grain and property. They suffered no casualties themselves.

This newspaper, Taiyue, 25th: The Taiyue Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Military Region and the General Assembly of the Armed Forces Committee issued a circular on the 20th of this month commending heroes such as Zhang Ximan, stating: On June 26, more than 160 enemies from Zhanglan in Jieshou went to Sendai Village to rob grain. Our Tainan and Tabei militias, cooperating with the Qinyuan Expeditionary Force and detachments, used a force equal to that of the enemy. Under the command of heroes such as Zhang Ximan, they took advantage of their familiarity with the terrain and the conditions of the masses, attacked Sendai Village and annihilated more than 100 enemies in one fell swoop with bold and mobile combat actions. This was the first brilliant example of our Taiyue District militia annihilating the enemy in battle. A special circular is hereby issued to commend the heroes who participated in the battle, and call on the militias in various places to learn from them.

This newspaper, Taiyue, 25th: The militias and local corps of Yuebei's Jie (xiu), Ling (shi), and Huo (xian) counties have achieved successive victories in the struggle to protect grain. From the 1st to the 12th of this month, a total of 188 enemy soldiers, including company commanders, were killed or wounded, nine were captured alive, two small cannons, four machine guns, eleven rifles, a batch of bullets, and three mules and horses were seized, and seven shi of grain were recovered. Since the wheat harvest, Yan's stubborn forces have concentrated their forces in the area to increase the number of strongholds, looting grain on a large scale. However, local armed militias have penetrated behind enemy lines to carry out activities. In particular, a certain squad and the Jieshou militia have fought in the enemy's grid area for ten days, winning three battles and thwarting several enemy grain-grabbing offensives, achieving remarkable results. On the 20th of this month, the leaders of the military region issued a circular to the whole region to commend the militias and local armed forces of the above counties, calling for continued compression and encirclement of the enemy.
