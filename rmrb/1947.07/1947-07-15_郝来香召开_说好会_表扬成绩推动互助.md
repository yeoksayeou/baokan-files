    Hao Laixiang Convenes "Praise Meeting"
    Commends Achievements, Promotes Mutual Aid
    [Our Taiyue dispatch, 13th] Hao Laixiang, the chairman of the Women's National Salvation Association of Houjia Village in the Second District of Tunliu, has become the guiding light for organizing women in the entire village. Originally, the women's mutual aid groups in Houjia Village were formed through commands and directives from cadres, resulting in groups existing in name only, with none actively engaged. Hao Laixiang recognized the failure of this organizational approach. She began to consider the problem and adopted a method of personally leading the way, organizing one group at a time. She started by organizing herself with Sun Huanmei, a standing committee member of the Women's National Salvation Association and a military family member; Wang Lanhai, an elderly military family member; and young women Han Lahai and Wei Xuanhai. They hauled manure for the military family Wang Lanhai, making 54 trips in one morning. This immediately earned praise from the entire village. Hao Laixiang then mobilized the Ren Wahai group. The two groups launched a challenge competition to deliver manure to Zhang Zhuang He Wan. In one morning, each person made seven trips. After being commended on the blackboard newspaper, the enthusiasm of the village women for mutual aid in production surged. Hao Laixiang seized the opportunity to promote their actual achievements and encourage them to organize others. She said, "Quickly finish delivering the manure, cultivate the crops well, and free up time for spinning yarn and making shoes." This led to the formation of the Zhao Chongmei group, the Zhao Guihua group, the Zhang Huanhai group, and the An Exian group. Even Wang Haixian, who was 42 years old and had bound feet, organized six people under her influence. Since May 4th, the groups have engaged in a manure delivery competition. Originally scheduled to be completed in ten days, it was finished in less than ten days. Hao Laixiang then convened a village-wide women's meeting. She summarized the achievements, commended labor models such as Ren Wahai and Zhao Chunmei, and proposed the task of making military shoes. After discussions, the groups launched a competition of "making them well and making them quickly." As the collective enthusiasm reached its peak, Hao Laixiang further raised the new question of "What will we do after the shoes are finished?" During small group discussions, Hao Laixiang's group, encouraged by the idea that "labor is capital," took the lead in formulating an annual plan for becoming prosperous. Consequently, all the groups formulated their plans, totaling 475 mu of seedling thinning, 200 mu of weeding, 180 mu of wheat harvesting, 695 jin of yarn spinning, 40 shi of rice earned from making shoes, 14 pigs raised, and 124 chickens raised. They also guaranteed to complete the military shoe task. Now, "Hurry up with mutual aid and get moving" and "Only move forward, no retreating" have become the most intimate and heartfelt words among the women, replacing the old societal tunes of "The husband is long and the wife is short" and "Trivial matters." To exchange experiences and solidify confidence, Hao Laixiang promptly gathered seven activists, including Ren Wahai and Zhao Chunmei, to hold a "Praise Meeting." At the meeting, everyone vividly shared their mutual aid experiences and production achievements. After reporting her labor achievements, Wang Haixian concluded by saying: Since joining the mutual aid group, I have been more energetic. It's true that "when the elderly get energized, they become more enthusiastic." Everyone said, "It's not enough for us to be good alone, we must also improve the group and help the groups that are not doing well to improve."

    郝来香召开“说好会”
    表扬成绩推动互助
    【本报太岳十三日电】屯留二区侯家庄妇救会主席郝来香成为全村妇女组织起来的方向。原来侯家庄妇女互助组由干部命令分组分队编制起来的，因此名义上组织起来了，实际却没有一组在行动，郝来香感到了编组的失败；就开始考虑这个问题，便用亲自带头组织起一个是一个，组织起一组算一组的办法，先和妇救常委兼军属的孙焕梅、军属老婆婆王兰孩、青年妇女韩拉孩、魏选孩五人组织起来，给军属王兰孩担粪，一上午就担了五十四回，这一下获得了全村的夸奖，接着郝来香又动员起任娃孩组，两组发动挑战竞赛，给张庄河湾送粪，一上午每人担了七回，经过了黑板报的表扬，全村妇女互助生产的热情陡然高涨，郝来香便趁热打铁，一面宣传她们两组的实际成绩，一面鼓动她们去组织别人。她说：“赶快把粪送完，庄稼养种好，腾出工夫好纺花做鞋”。这样一下又组织起赵崇梅组、赵桂花组、张焕孩组、安蛾先组，连四十二岁又是小脚的王海先在她影响下圪连了六个人，也组织起来了。自五月四日起，各组展开送粪竞赛，原定十天完成，不到十天就全部送完。郝来香接着又召开全村妇女大会，一面总结成绩，表扬了任娃孩、赵春梅等劳动模范，并提出军鞋任务，展开讨论，结果组与组展开了“做的好、做的快”的竞赛，郝来香在这大家情绪已达最高潮的时候，更进一步提出了“鞋做完了又做什”的新问题，小组酝酿中，郝来香组在“劳动就是本钱”鼓励下，自己先订出了发财致富的全年计划，就这样各组也都把计划订出：总计拔苗四百七十五亩，锄苗二百亩，割麦一百八十亩，纺织赚花六百九十五斤，做鞋赚米四十石，养猪十四口，养鸡一百二十四只，军鞋保证都做好。现在“赶紧互助，好好动弹”，“只准向前，不准退后”已成了妇女中间最亲切的体己话，代替了旧社会“翁长婆短”“鸡毛蒜皮”的老调。郝来香为了交流经验，巩固信心，及时召集任娃孩、赵春梅等七个积极分子开“说好会”，会上大家都很生动的把互助经验，生产成绩介绍出来，王海先在把她劳动成绩报告之后，作总结时说：自从参加了互助组，俺动弹的更有劲了，真是：“老人起了劲，越闹越带劲”。大家说：“单咱好不算，还要把组搞好，帮助没搞好的组也搞好”。
