　　Strive for Eighty Percent Yields in a Fifty Percent Year
  　Jincheng's Ninth District Organizes Increased Production
  　Qiuxian's Second District Launches Land Reclamation and Replanting Campaign
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 27th dispatch] Jincheng's Ninth District convened a meeting on the 12th of this month with over 240 attendees, including district and village cadres, model mutual aid team leaders, and honorably discharged soldiers, to review production, mutual aid, frugality, and famine preparedness, and to elect models. The slogan "Strive for Eighty Percent Yields in a Fifty Percent Year" was proposed at the meeting, aiming to hoe millet and miscellaneous grains three times and cotton seven times. Niu Zhaojun, the leader of the mutual aid team in Qutou Village, said: "My mutual aid team has worked out a method to increase production by 30%: (1) Eliminate all the wasteland in the village and plant beans, which can increase income by 10%; (2) Plant one mu of radish per household, which can increase income by 10%; (3) Hoe the autumn seedlings one more time, which can yield one more dou per mu, increasing income by 10%." The conference concluded by selecting five model teams: Cheng Sanwang's team in Nanyicheng Village, Niu Zhaojun's team in Quguan, Li Yongye's team in Lu Village, Li Gaihai's team led by the Women's Federation Chairman of Xibo South, Chang Wei's team, and Jin Jindan in Mayu Village. Sanjiadian Village was also selected as a model drought-resistant village. Under the persuasion and education of Village Head Li Xueshan, Farmers' Association Chairman Zhao Shuitu, Women's Federation Chairman Wang Chunlan, and other comrades, 80% of the families in the village accumulated vegetables and ate bran. Additionally, 64 model honorably discharged soldiers and 7 model military families were selected.
    [This newspaper, South Hebei, 27th dispatch] Villages in Qiuxian's Second District are launching land reclamation movements. Although the slogan "Not an inch of land should be left barren" was previously proposed, wasteland still existed due to a lack of inspection. After this land reclamation campaign was launched, each village established a production committee to conduct serious inspections and registrations. In less than a day, Cheng'erzhai discovered 90 mu of vacant land. Liang'erzhuang is a production base village, and village cadres had repeatedly stated that there was no wasteland, but this time another 12 mu were found. A total of 3,080 mu of wasteland were found in all 51 villages in the district. Calculated at 80 jin of grain per mu, the total harvest would be 246,400 jin. The district has now formulated measures based on various reasons for wasteland and is calling on the entire district to step up replanting. Under the leadership of the production committees organized in each village, a campaign of concentrated plowing and replanting is immediately underway. The Sun Village Farmers' Association in Qinghe recovered 60 mu of landlord land, and the entire village rushed to complete the replanting in two days. The method of planting first and then distributing was adopted to eliminate vacant land. Huangtaitou Village discovered 172 mu of vacant land, and cadres took the lead in completing the replanting in three days. Boxu Village had 418 mu of land left barren due to alkalinity. Village cadres explained that after the rain, the alkalinity would dissipate, making it easier for seedlings to emerge, and mobilized the masses to complete the replanting in four days.

    【本报冀南二十七日电】邱县二区村村开展查荒运动。过去虽曾提出：“不荒一寸土”口号，但因无检查，仍有荒地存在。这次提出查荒后，各村建立生产委员会，认真检查登记。不到一天时间，程二寨即查出白地九十亩。梁二庄是生产基点村，村干部几次说没有荒地了，这次又查出了十二亩。全区五十一村，共查出荒地三千零八十亩，按每亩可产粮八十斤计算，共收粮二十四万六千四百斤。该区现已根据各种荒芜原因，订出办法号召全区加紧抢种，各村都组织生产委员会领导下这一工作，突击抢耕，抢种立即展开。清河孙村农会收回地主地六十亩，全村突击两天抢种完。采取先种后分的办法消灭了白地。黄台头村查出白地一百七十二亩，干部带头三天抢种完毕。驳胡营因地碱而荒了四百十八亩，村干说明在雨后碱性消灭易出苗，动员群众四天抢种完毕。
