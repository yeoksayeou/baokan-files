Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on the American government's dispatch of Wedemeyer to China, saying: "The Chinese people are all too familiar with American imperialists who have received education in German militarism. Wedemeyer's record in China is that after the Japanese surrender, he immediately sent American troops to occupy Qingdao, Tianjin, Beiping, and Qinhuangdao, which were surrounded by the People's Liberation Army. He commanded Japanese and puppet troops to guard these cities, refusing to surrender to the People's Liberation Army. At the same time, Wedemeyer organized the largest airlift he had ever organized, transporting six of Chiang Kai-shek's armies by air to Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Jinan. Later, he transported five more armies by sea for Chiang Kai-shek, passing through Qinhuangdao, which was occupied by the American army, and sent them to the Northeast. That was where the Northeast People's Volunteer Army had been active for fourteen years, and also where Chiang Kai-shek had long declared he did not want. Because Wedemeyer committed these ugly deeds of helping the dictator Chiang Kai-shek and opposing the Chinese people, he and Hurley were equally infamous. When Marshall wanted to show the Chinese people that he was a "neutral" "mediator," he had to send Wedemeyer back to the United States. Now, the American imperialists Truman and Marshall see that Chiang Kai-shek is about to collapse, and the position of American imperialism in China is also in danger. In order to let go of their aggression against China and support the dying rule of Chiang Kai-shek, the United States has not only thrown the mask of "neutrality" into the trash heap long ago, but also sent the notorious Wedemeyer to China. This shows that American imperialism is very panicked and needs to use open, barbaric, and direct methods to interfere in China's internal affairs, just like interfering in Greece. American imperialists will find that their assessment of China is wrong. The Chinese people are as brave and resolute as the Greek people, but the strength of the Chinese people is many times greater than that of Greece. The Chinese people expelled Japanese imperialism and will certainly be able to expel American imperialism."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. Following the sale of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway in May of last year and the sale of the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway construction rights to the United States in October, Chiang Kai-shek is now proceeding to sell the management rights of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the construction rights of the Sichuan-Yunnan Railway to American imperialism. According to a TASS dispatch from Nanjing on the 12th, citing a Hong Kong "Chinese Business Daily" dispatch from Kunming: According to sources related to the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, Chiang Kai-shek's sale of these two railways is to exchange for American loans for Chiang's civil war. On June 26th, a special plane of the U.S. military advisory group stationed in Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Kunming specifically to negotiate this matter. Among them was a special representative of the United States, and more than 30 people accompanied him, staying at the Xiaoshiqiao Station, the joint office of the two railway bureaus, and immediately discussed with the responsible representatives of the two railway bureaus the procedures for the transfer of rights and interests of these two railways. (Note: The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is about 1,000 Chinese miles long, and the Sichuan-Yunnan Railway, which has not yet been built, is about 2,000 Chinese miles long.)

    美帝国主义图放手侵华
    中国人民定能予以驱逐
    新华社记者评魏德迈来华
    【新华社陕北十五日电】新华社记者评美国政府派遣魏德迈来华说：“对于受德国军国主义教育的美国帝国主义者，中国人民是太熟悉了。魏德迈在中国的纪录，就是他在日本投降后立即派美国军队，占领人民解放军所包围的青岛、天津、北平、秦皇岛，指挥日军和伪军把守这些城市，拒绝向人民解放军投降。同时魏德迈组织了他平生所组织的最大的一次空运，即是把六个蒋介石的军空运前往上海、南京、北平、天津、青岛、济南；以后又替蒋介石海运了五个军，经过美军所占领的秦皇岛，打到东北去。那里是东北人民义勇军活跃了十四年的地方，也是蒋介石早已宣言不要了的地方。因为魏德迈做了这些帮助独裁者蒋介石和反对中国人民的丑行，所以他和赫尔利同样的声名狼籍。当马歇尔要向中国人民表示他自己是“中立”的“调解者”的时候，不能不把魏德迈送回美国去。现在美帝国主义者杜鲁门、马歇尔看到蒋介石就要垮台，美帝国主义在中国的地位也发生危险，为了放手侵略中国和扶持垂死的蒋介石统治，美国不但早已把“中立”的面具抛到垃圾堆里，而且把臭名昭著的魏德迈派到中国来，这表示美国帝国主义已经十分着慌，须要用公开的、野蛮的、直接的方式来干涉中国内政，象干涉希腊一样。美国帝国主义者将要发现他们对中国的估计是错误的，中国人民象希腊人民一样的勇敢、坚决，但中国人民的力量比希腊强大得不知多少倍。中国人民驱逐了日本帝国主义，也一定能驱逐美国帝国主义。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】蒋介石继去年五月出卖成渝路、十月出卖粤汉路修建权与美国之后，顷又进行出卖滇越路之管理权与川滇路之兴建权与美国帝国主义。据塔斯社南京十二日电引香港华商报昆明通讯称：据滇越路有关方面指陈，蒋介石将此两铁路出卖，系为交换美国对蒋内战贷款。六月二十六日美驻蒋军事顾问团之专机飞抵昆明专门谈判此事，其中有美国特别代表，另有三十余人随行，下榻于两路局联合办公处之小石桥车站，随即与两路局负责代表进行讨论此二铁路权益转让之程序问题。（按滇越铁路全长约一千华里，尚未兴修之川滇铁路全长约二千华里。）
