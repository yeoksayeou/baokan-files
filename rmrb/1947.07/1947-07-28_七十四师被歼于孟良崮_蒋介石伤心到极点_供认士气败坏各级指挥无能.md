Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 25th. Liu Bocheng's troops captured a large number of documents from the Kuomintang's 55th Division during the Yuncheng Campaign, including a public document from Chiang Kai-shek lamenting the 74th Division. The document reveals Chiang's heartbreak over the incompetence and low morale of his own troops and generals, and his resentment towards nearby units for failing to provide assistance. The document first acknowledges the reasons for the disastrous defeat of the Kuomintang army at Menglianggu: "With our absolutely superior revolutionary military force (note: tool of treasonous dictatorship), we were actually entrapped by inferior, disorganized bandits (note: a false accusation against the Liberation Army). The reasons for this may be inaccurate intelligence, unclear terrain; or insufficient research, erroneous deployment, resulting in demoralization, sluggish action, low morale, and disciplinary breakdown, affecting combat effectiveness. However, the biggest shortcoming is the selfish desire of commanders at all levels to protect themselves each month, lacking a spirit of unified cooperation, which allowed the bandits to control us and defeat us one by one." Then it describes the embarrassing situation of the division when it was annihilated and the heavy losses: "Ordered to defend the high ground of Menglianggu, the mountain was composed of rocky layers, an exposed target, forming a bullet nest. In a few days, casualties followed one another, drinking water was cut off, food and ammunition were exhausted, the entire division was isolated, surrounded by enemies. At that time, the number of officers and soldiers killed in action, including Deputy Brigade Commander Ming Can, exceeded 10,000. Those who finally refused to surrender and committed suicide on the battlefield included more than 20 senior generals, such as Division Commander Zhang Lingfu, Deputy Division Commander Cai Renjie, and Regiment Commander Zhou Shaobin. Their tragedy and valor (note: being annihilated so thoroughly and cleanly) can be said to be unprecedented (note: truly an unprecedented loss), how can it not be painful!" (note: really heartbroken)! Finally, he blamed "friendly forces for failing to provide effective assistance, leading to this disastrous defeat," and issued a disciplinary order: "As for those divisions that failed to fight effectively at that time, in addition to dismissing Li Tianxia, the commander of the 83rd Division, and handing him over to military law for trial, the commanders of nearby divisions and those related to the failure to provide assistance in combat must be promptly investigated for responsibility and severely punished according to the law, in order to serve as a warning." (note: Chiang's anxiety is of no use.)

　　七十四师被歼于孟良崮
  　蒋介石伤心到极点
  　供认士气败坏各级指挥无能
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫二十五日电】刘伯承将军所部在郓城战役中缴获蒋军五十五师大批文件中，有蒋介石痛悼七四师公文一件，文中揭露蒋贼对家兵家将之无能与士气低落伤心不已，并瞒怨临近部队之见死不救，应援不力。该文首先供认孟良崮蒋军惨败的原因：“以我绝对优势的革命武力（按卖国独裁的工具），竟为劣势乌合之匪（按系诬指解放军）众所陷害，其中原因或以谍报不确，地形不明；或以研究不足，部署错误，以至精神不振，行动萎靡，士气低落，纪律败坏，影响作战力量。然研究其最大缺点，厥为各级指挥官每月苟且自保之妄念，无协同一致之精神，致为匪所制，以致各个击破”。接着就说到该师被歼时的狼狈景况与损失的惨重：“奉令坚守孟良崮之高地，该山石岩层层，目标暴露，形成弹巢。数日之间，死伤相继，饮水断绝，粮弹俱尽，全师孤悬，四面受敌。当时阵亡者计有副旅长明灿等官兵一万余名，最后不屈即在阵地相率自戕者，计有师长张灵甫、副师长蔡仁杰、团长周少宾等高级将领二十余人，其悲惨壮烈（按：被歼灭得如此彻底干净），可谓史无前例（按：真是空前大损失），能不令人哀痛”（按：实在伤心）！最后便归咎“友军应援不力，致招此惨败，来了一道惩戒令：“至于当时应援各师作战不力者，除八十三师师长李天霞已予革职交军法审判外，立将邻近各师长与作战不援有关者，迅即查明责任，依法严办，以昭炯戒。”（按：蒋贼再着急，岂奈于事无补。）
