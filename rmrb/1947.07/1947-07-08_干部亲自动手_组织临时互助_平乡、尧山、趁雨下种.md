　　Cadres Take the Lead
  　Organize Temporary Mutual Aid
  　Pingxiang, Yaoshan, Plant During the Rain
    [Report from this newspaper] On June 23rd, in several villages in the second district of Pingxiang (referring to the second and third subdistricts), District Chief Guo, along with Assistant Xie and Comrade Cai, led a rush planting campaign in Yang'er Village, Jia Village, Shi Village, Gongqiao Village, and Xiao Zhang Village in the fourth subdistrict. Using a voluntary mutual aid format, they planted under the slogan "Don't leave an acre of land unplanted." Yang'er Village rushed to plant more than 200 mu. Jia Village rushed to plant more than 700 mu. Shi Village rushed to plant more than 600 mu. Zhang Xiushan in Zhangqiao organized a seven-person mutual aid group, influencing the masses with the slogan of not leaving even one mu of land uncultivated for families of soldiers resisting the enemy, the elderly, the weak, the orphaned, and the widowed. The whole village has now planted more than 900 mu. Everyone has enough confidence to finish planting all the land and is in high spirits.
    Statistics show that more than 20 hectares have been rushed to plant in the four subdistricts. All the sluice gates in the second district have also been opened, and land is being irrigated and rushed to plant. After a mobilization meeting by village cadres in the third district, under the slogan of "Not a single person idle, not a single well idle," a point-planting rush was carried out. From the second to the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, more than 5,000 mu of corn were rush-planted in four days. On the 5th, there was a thorough rain (in one area) in Donggu, Ximiaoshang, Dongxi Tiangu, and Lin'er Village, and 552 mu of corn and 120 mu of millet were rushed to be planted. The enthusiastic point-planting rush is continuing. In the fourth district, a general mobilization was held in Licun, Zuo Fengma, and Bei Malu to rush to plant. According to statistics from seventeen villages, 16,687 mu were sown. (Pingxiang Victory Small Newspaper)
    [Report from this newspaper] Yaoshan had a good rain on the evening of the 22nd, and the masses stopped pulling water carts to water their gardens and took advantage of the weather to rush to plant with excitement and joy. The Nan Guan Production Command Headquarters put forward at a cadre meeting: "Mobilize all forces to carry out rush planting," calling on everyone to make contributions and strive to become a production hero. In order to quickly complete the rush planting work, each group discussed work plans separately. The Yuqiu group quickly completed the rush planting task. The Xu Cheng Shen group's three-day rush planting plan was completed in one and a half days with the hard work of livestock plowing and people pulling plows, completing 50 mu of planting. The Zhang Yuxin group took the initiative to propose: to complete the task in one day and help the Luolei group for one day. All 22 groups in the village completed 697 mu of rush planting in two days. In Dongliang Village, 79 groups, with a total of more than 800 men and women, started a rush planting upsurge after the rain. Thanks to the leadership's use of public blackboards to commend models and the proper allocation of labor and agricultural tools, 1,885 mu of autumn seedlings have been completed in three days. The Dye Red masses cultivated during the day and pulled water carts at night, singing ditties: "Don't ask gods, don't rely on heaven, as long as we work hard, we will surely have food and clothing." The village has now achieved a state where there are no idle people and no barren land. Most villages have now completed rush planting.
