Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 22nd—In the vigorous struggle to unearth treasures and pursue floating wealth in the counties of Wuchang, Bin County, Shangzhi, Hailun, Bayan, and Shuangcheng in Northern Manchuria, floating assets worth over 20 billion were uncovered. Among them, the treasures alone amounted to 103.9 taels of gold and 239 catties of silver. The magnitude of the results is unprecedented. In Shangzhi County, the landlords Dong Xilai and others of the "Four Big Families" in Fuyong Village had already had their land distributed during the land reform last year, but they still possessed substantial wealth. Dong often said coldly to the masses: "Don't think I've been liquidated; I'm still much better off than you. I can hang my plow on the wall and not worry about food and clothing for twenty years." The masses realized that if they didn't dig out his family's wealth, the poor would still not be able to completely turn themselves over. They rose up and engaged in in-depth struggle, uncovering enormous wealth, with an average of 60,000 yuan in fruits for each person. The masses in the whole village cheered with joy: "Felling big trees provides firewood; gold, silver, and treasures are returning home in great quantities!" Now, peasants from all directions, in groups and teams, are armed and escorting hundreds of large carts, transporting the floating assets, and are preparing to purchase livestock and farm tools. The joyful shouts reveal a magnificent new scene of liberated peasants' spirit.

　　金银财宝一齐还家北满各县清查浮财
    【新华社东北二十二日电】北满五常、宾县、尚志、海伦、巴彦、双城等县在轰轰烈烈的挖财宝追浮物斗争中，共起出浮财约二百亿以上。其中财宝一项，即挖出金子一百零三斤九两、银子二百三十九斤，果实之巨大，实属空前。尚志县富永村地主董希来等“四大家”，去年土地改革时曾被分过了地，但仍保有雄厚的财富。董常冷言对群众说：“别看我已被清算，还比你们强的多，我把犁杖挂在墙上，不愁二十年吃穿。”群众看出不挖出其家底，穷人仍然不能彻底翻身，遂起而深入斗争，起出巨大财富，平均每人获得果实六万元。全村群众畅快欢呼：“砍倒大树有柴烧，金银财宝大还家。”现四乡农民成群结队手执武器，押着数百辆大车，起运浮物，纷纷准备添置牲口农具。欢快的吆喝声，显出一片翻身农民气势豪壮的新景象。
