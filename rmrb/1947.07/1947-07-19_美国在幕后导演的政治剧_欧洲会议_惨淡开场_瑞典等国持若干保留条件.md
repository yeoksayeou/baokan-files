Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Paris dispatch: The so-called "European Recovery Conference," convened solely by Britain and France, opened in Paris on the 12th. Bevin presided, with only 16 countries participating. Eight countries, including Czechoslovakia and Poland, refused to participate, leaving many empty seats in the conference hall. In addition to discussing the draft plan for a European organization prepared in advance by Britain and France, a "Steering Committee" was established according to the wishes of Britain and France to lead the work of the conference. French representative Alphand was appointed chairman of the committee. When discussing the purpose of the conference formulated by Bevin and Bidault, only Italy expressed unreserved support. Representatives from other countries were willing to state their policies only after the working committee reported on the details of the conference plan on the 13th. Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and other countries, forced to participate, held several reservations about the conference. British and French officials have repeatedly stated that the conference has no political purpose, but a Reuters dispatch on the 12th revealed: "The initiating countries are deliberately trying to avoid the political aspects of the economic plan, but observers and delegates unanimously believe that once the expert committee begins its work, many political issues will inevitably arise in various forms." TASS pointed out: The conference will also discuss the merger of the British, American, and French occupied zones in Germany to divide Germany. The US aid to Turkey and Greece and the US-Sweden trade agreement forcing Sweden to sign should be good lessons for the participating small countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Paris dispatch: The so-called "European Economic Recovery Conference" held its second session on the 13th. The main topic was to pass the plan for establishing a special European organization, pre-prepared by Britain and France. This special organization is the "Cooperation Committee," with the participation of all participating countries. Under it is an executive committee, composed of a few countries, to oversee day-to-day work. The relationship between the Cooperation Committee and the United Nations is only to "maintain close contact to avoid overlapping functions." During the meeting, due to the insistence of Belgium, Sweden, and other countries, a slightly more flexible resolution had to be passed, stating that in the course of the Cooperation Committee's work, if it is found necessary, it should have the right to take appropriate modifications to the current resolution's organization. Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and other countries expressed regret that the short duration of the conference did not allow the leading committee to exchange views on the focus of the upcoming issues. Parisian press pointed out that this reflects the contradictions in the leading committee. In the leading committee, representatives of some countries requested an explanation of whether the methods planned by the authors (referring to Britain and France) of the "Cooperation Committee" would hinder the political and economic sovereignty of the countries participating in this organization; however, the leading countries (Britain and France) in the leading committee evaded the discussion and response to this issue with various excuses.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: TASS Paris dispatch: The "Leading Committee" of the "European Economic Recovery Conference" held a meeting on the 14th and decided on the list of the Executive Committee and four technical committees of the special European organization, the "Cooperation Committee." The composition of each committee was proposed by the British and French delegations. The Executive Committee includes Britain, France, Italy, Norway, and the Netherlands; Italy's participation was at the suggestion of the United States. During the meeting, the representatives of the Scandinavian countries (Sweden, Norway, Denmark) requested to understand the true situation of "political issues" but were also prevented by French representative Alphand. The spokesperson of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs was forced to admit at a press conference: "The conference is somewhat disunited." And the Free Parisian newspaper declared: "The Paris Conference opened under ominous signs, and distrust has prevailed. The representatives of Sweden, Denmark, and Switzerland expressed concern, wanting to know the true development of events and requesting clarification of the current situation."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Washington dispatch: Marshall made a series of statements on "Aid to European Economic Recovery" at a secret meeting of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the morning of the 11th. According to another dispatch from Paris: British Foreign Secretary Bevin met with French Prime Minister Ramadier on the evening of the 12th.

    美国在幕后导演的政治剧
    “欧洲会议”惨淡开场
    瑞典等国持若干保留条件
    【新华社陕北十四日电】巴黎讯：英法单独召开的所谓“欧洲复兴会议”，已于十二日在巴黎开幕。贝文主席，与会者仅十六国，捷克、波兰等八国拒绝参加，会场座位甚形空疏。会中除讨论英法事先拟好的欧洲组织计划草案以外，并按照英法的意旨成立了一个“指导委员会”，以领导大会之工作，法代表阿尔芳担任该委员会主席。当讨论贝文与比道尔所拟定之会议宗旨时，仅意大利一国表示无保留的支持，其他各国代表则须十三日工作委员会在会上报告会议计划详况后，才愿声明其政策。其中被迫参加的瑞士、瑞典、挪威、丹麦等国，对会议更持有若干保留条件。英法官方曾屡次声明这次会议无政治目的，而路透社十二日电讯却透露：“会议的发起国都有意的极力避免经济计划的政治方面，但是观察家和与会代表们一致认为，当专家委员会开始工作以后，许多政治问题将不可避免的会以各种形式发生。”塔斯社指出：会议还会讨论德境英美法占领区的合并以分裂德国。美国对土希的援助和迫使瑞典签订的美瑞贸易协定，应是与会各小国很好的教训。
    【新华社陕北十五日电】巴黎讯：所谓“欧洲经济复兴会议”，于十三日举行第二次大会，主要议题为通过英法事先拟定的建立欧洲特别机构之计划。该特别机构为“合作委员会”，由与会各国全体参加。其下设一执行委员会，由少数几国组成，以总揽日常工作。合作委员会与联合国之联系，仅为“保持密切联系以避免机能之重叠”。会中，由于比利时、瑞典等国之坚持，不得不通过一个稍具弹性的决议，即在合作委员会的工作过程中，如发现有必要时，应有权对目前决议之机构采取适当的修改。瑞典、挪威、丹麦等国，对大会时间短促不允许领导委员会对行将到来的各项问题的重心交换意见表示遗憾。巴黎新闻界指出：这反映了领导委员会中的矛盾。在领导委员会上，一部分国家代表曾要求解释“合作委员会”这套机构的作者（指英法）所计划的方法，是否妨害参加这种机构的国家的政治与经济主权；而领导委员会中的领袖国（英法）则以各种借口规避这个问题的讨论与答复。
    【新华社陕北十六日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：“欧洲经济复兴会议”之“领导委员会”，于十四日举行会议，决定了欧洲特别组织机构“合作委员会”之执行委员会及四个技术委员会的名单，每一委员会之组成均有英法代表团提议。执行委员会包括英、法、意、挪、荷等五国；意大利之得以参加，系美国的示意。会议中，斯堪的纳维亚各国（瑞典、挪威、丹麦）代表要求了解“政治问题”的真实情况，亦为法代表阿尔芳所阻止。法国外交部发言人在记者会上被迫承认：“会议多少有些不团结的现象。”而自由巴黎人报宣称：“巴黎会议在不祥之兆中开幕了，不信任已占了上风。瑞典、丹麦、瑞士三国代表表示忧虑，他们想知道事情的真正发展，并要求对目前情势加以澄清。”
    【新华社陕北十四日电】华府讯：马歇尔于十一日晨在美参院外委会秘密会议中，作关于“援助欧洲经济复兴”之一连串声明。另据巴黎讯：英外长贝文十二日晚与法总理拉马第晤谈。
