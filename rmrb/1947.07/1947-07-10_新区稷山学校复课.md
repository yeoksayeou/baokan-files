    【This newspaper Taiyue 8th dispatch】 The six senior primary schools, one middle school, and over 120 national primary schools in the newly liberated Jishan County, distributed in various districts and townships, have successively resumed classes on the 25th of last month. The county convened a symposium on cultural and educational matters from the 16th to the 18th of last month, attended by over 200 teachers and intellectuals from across the county, to jointly discuss the restoration of educational work, which had been devastated by the enemy, puppet, Chiang, and Yan regimes for many years, and to implement the new educational guidelines. At the meeting, the teachers highly praised the various policies of the democratic government and the new educational guidelines. Mr. He Zhiyuan, a senior figure in the education field who had been living in seclusion in the northern mountains during the occupation by Chiang and Yan, also rushed to participate and stated, "In the past, the tyranny was as fierce as a tiger, and I dared not but hide. Today, we are liberated, and I am determined to dedicate myself to educational work again." After heated discussions, the conference decided that the future educational guidelines would be: 1. Intensify the study of current affairs and politics; 2. Mobilize poor children to attend school; 3. Abolish classical Chinese, the Four Books, and Chiang and Yan's textbooks for the purpose of keeping the people ignorant; 4. Strengthen children's labor, and combine learning with production; 5. Adopt inductive and heuristic education methods, and abolish corporal punishment; 6. Strengthen social education, and overcome the feudal ideology of favoring men over women.

　　新区稷山学校复课
    【本报太岳八日电】新解放之稷山县分布在各区乡之六座高孝一座中学、百廿余座国民小学，已于上月廿五日先后复课。该县曾于上月十六日至十八日召开全县二百余教员及知识分子的文教座谈会，共商恢复被敌伪蒋阎摧残多年之教育工作，与贯彻新教育方针。会上各教员对民主政府各种政策及新教育方针倍加赞扬。于蒋阎占领期间隐居北山之教育界前辈何之远老先生亦赶来参加，并发言称：“以往暴政猛如虎不敢不躲开，今天解放了，决心仍献身于教育工作”。大会经过热烈的讨论，决定今后教育方针为：一、加紧时事政治学习；二、动员贫苦儿童入学；三、取消文言、四书及蒋阎愚民课本；四、加强儿童劳动、学习与生产结合；五、教育方式上采取诱导启发教育，废除体罚制度；六、加强社会教育，克服重男轻女的封建思想。
