Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: TASS, Rio, 30th: "De Press" recently published a commentary on the United States' recent sale of weapons and military equipment worth 1.1 million U.S. dollars to Brazil, stating: "We need hoes and plows, but Marshall gives us rifles and machine guns; we export food, but in exchange we get weapons to protect the lives of Wall Street tycoons." On the same day, Brazil's "O Obrero" also published an editorial opposing the Brazilian government's current trade policy and advocating for strengthened trade with the Soviet Union. The editorial stated: When our national interests require extensive trade development with the Soviet Union, our government, under the pressure of American imperialism, has taken the opposite direction, seriously damaging Brazil's national economy. Given the impending American crisis, the consequences of this policy are particularly dangerous. The newspaper pointed out that trade with the Soviet Union is based on complete equality, unlike the U.S. which forces acceptance of one-sided conditions. This is why Brazilian exporters and manufacturers facing a crisis are eager to establish trade relations with the Soviet Union.

　　巴西人民反对美国军事援助
  　商家热望与苏建立贸易关系
    【新华社陕北三日电】塔斯社里约三十日讯：“德培斯特”报顷就美国最近以价值一百十万元的武器与军事装备售与巴西一事发表评论称：“我们需要锄头和犁，马歇尔却给我们步枪和机关枪；我们输出粮食，换来的却是武器，以便保护华尔街大亨们的生活。”同日巴西之“奥伯拉里奥”报亦发表社论，反对巴西政府现行贸易政策，主张加强对苏贸易。社论称：当我国国民利益需要广泛地对苏发展贸易时，我国政府却在美帝国主义的压力下采取了相反的方向，严重地损害了巴西的国民经济。鉴于美国危机的即将到来，此种政策的后果尤为危险。该报指出，与苏联的贸易系站在完全平等的基础上，而不象美国强迫接受单方面的条件，这就是为什么巴西面临危机的出口商人与厂家均热望与苏联建立贸易关系的缘故。
