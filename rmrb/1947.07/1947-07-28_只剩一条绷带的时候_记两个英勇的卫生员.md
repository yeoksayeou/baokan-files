　　Only One Bandage Left
  　Remembering Two Heroic Medics
    The rain poured down harder, and the enemy's shells fell even more densely. But this posed no threat to him—medic Ye Jiangang. He calmly bandaged the wounds of a wounded soldier lying in the muddy puddle. Suddenly, a bullet pierced his stomach, and blood flowed out. He knew that an abdominal wound was dangerous, but what could he do? He had only one bandage left. The squad leader of the sixth squad was groaning in the mud. Could he just watch and ignore him? No! Never.
    The gunfire continued intensely, and the rain continued to pour. Without hesitation, he rolled through the mud toward where the sixth squad leader was lying. Although there was only one bandage left, just one, he bandaged it on the sixth squad leader, his own stomach still bleeding.
    When he returned to his position, another bullet struck his head. He—the heroic seventeen-year-old medic Comrade Ye Jiangang, gloriously sacrificed his life.
    In the battles around Jinxiang and Yutai, Comrade Ye Jiangang always completed his mission under the most difficult conditions. In a very short time, he bandaged the wounds of more than thirty wounded soldiers, and he also mobilized and reassured others in other squads, stabilizing their morale.
    When the sixth company inserted itself into the village, the situation was temporarily bad. Enemies on all sides attacked our house. Seventeen-year-old medic Zhang Yuanzheng was always able to inspire and stabilize the mood of those who were uneasy. He said, "Comrades, our artillery has been pulled up, the telephone lines have been laid, and the first and third detachments are about to launch an attack!" He also comforted the wounded comrades, telling them not to make a sound and to endure it.
    He heard that three comrades had been wounded in front and were being blockaded by the enemy with one heavy machine gun, two light machine guns, and five rifles. Passing through this place was very dangerous. But he resolutely wanted to go up and bandage and stop the bleeding of these three wounded, beloved comrades. The instructor and company commander could not stop him, and the comrades could not stop him either. The instructor wanted to go with him, but he said, "One person is a smaller target." He ran forward and was stopped again by our sentries. The enemy's firepower was blocking him from going. He could not bear to see his comrades bleeding and insisted on going. He accidentally slipped on the mud and fell into the puddle. The enemy's gunfire was loud, and bullets fell around him like raindrops. He calmly and skillfully demonstrated the high qualities of a medical worker without panic. He finally crawled to the wounded and completed his mission. After the battle, the entire company automatically wanted to give him credit. The political instructor said, "This is truly a hero supported by the masses." (Liu Huimin, Health Captain of the 10th Unit of the 21st Brigade)

### 只剩一条绷带的时候　记两个英勇的卫生员

　　只剩一条绷带的时候
  　记两个英勇的卫生员
    雨越下越紧，敌人的炮弹也是越打越紧。但这对于他——卫生员叶建刚是一点威胁也没有，他仍然沉着的给卧在泥泊中的伤员扎绷带；突然，一颗子弹穿进他的肚子，鲜血流出来，他知道伤着腹部是危险的，但又怎么办呢，手里仅仅只余一根绳带了，躺在泥泊中的六班长在呻吟着，他能看着不管吗？不！不会的。
    枪声继续的紧，雨更继续的淋，他一点也不犹豫的，在泥泊里滚向六班长躺的地方。虽然只剩一根绷带，只有一根，他给六班长扎上，自己的肚子仍然流着血。
    当他再回到他的位置的时候，头上又着一弹，他——这位英勇的十七岁的卫生员叶建刚同志光荣牺牲了。
    金乡、鱼台外围战，叶建刚同志总是在最困难的条件下，完成他的任务。很短的时间，他就包扎了三十余伤员的伤口，他还给别的班动员解释稳定别人的情绪。
    六连插到庄子里的时候，一时情况不好，四面的敌人进攻我们这一座房子，十七岁的卫生员张元正，随时能作鼓动，稳定不安者的情绪，他说：“同志们，咱们的大炮拉上去啦，电话架好啦，一、三分队马上就要发起冲锋！”他并安慰负了伤的同志，不要吭声，忍耐一下。
    他听说前面有三个同志受了伤，被敌人用一挺重机、两挺轻机、五支步枪封锁着，通过这地方是很危险的。可是他坚决的要上去，给这三位负伤的亲爱的战友绷扎、止血，指导员连长阻止不了他，大家同志也阻止不了他，指导员要与他一块去，他说：“一个人目标小。”他跑到前边，又被我们哨兵挡住了，敌人火力封锁不让他去，他不忍心自己同志流血，坚决要去，一不小心被泥滑倒了，躺在泥泊中，敌人的枪声紧紧的响，子弹象雨点似的落在他的身边，他不慌又不忙沉着机敏的表现了卫生人员的高度品质，终于爬到受伤者的跟前，完成了自己的任务。战斗后，全连自动要给他立功，教导员说：“这真是真正群众拥护的英雄。”（二十一大队一○部队卫生队长刘惠民）
