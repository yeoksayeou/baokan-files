    Military Factory No. 1 Conducts Emancipation Education
    Workers Voluntarily Offer Up "Air Raid Shelter"
    [This Newspaper's Report] The entire staff of Military Factory No. 1, through ideological transformation studies, has made the relationship between the local area and the factory closer, further strengthening the worker-peasant unity and helping the masses to thoroughly emancipate themselves. Through emancipation education in thought, they broke down incorrect understandings of mass movements and exposed individual workers' "air raid shelters," calling on them to hand over hidden fruits of struggle. Many comrades examined their past insufficient understanding of mass movements, admitting they stood outside the circle of the masses. A few comrades who made "air raid shelters" also voluntarily handed over hidden gains, including 20,000 yuan in Jiyi currency, 30 yuan in current currency, ten pieces of silk and foreign cloth clothing, two satin mattresses, nine taels of silverware, one large red brocade quilt, one red brocade clothing piece, as well as silver hairpins, silver rings, grain, cloth, and other items. The factory headquarters decided to register and return them to local governments for distribution to the masses. At the same time, in the nearby ×× village, through free thought, they consciously reflected and found that the masses had over-collected 8,000 yuan in transportation fees from the factory for carrying goods. The village's political director personally returned the money to the factory. The self-criticisms of both sides were extremely harmonious. (Lü Yan)

    军工一厂进行翻身教育
    工人自觉献出“防空洞”
    【本报讯】军工一厂全体职工，在改造思想学习中，使地方与工厂关系更加密切，并进一步加强了工农团结，帮助群众彻底翻身。在思想上进行翻身教育，打破了对群运不正确认识，并揭发个别工人“防空洞”，号召拿出隐藏斗争果实。不少同志检讨过去对群运认识不足，自己站在群众圈子之外，少数做“防空洞”的同志也自觉缴出隐藏果实，计冀洋二万元，现洋三十元，绸子、洋布衣服十件，缎褥子两个，银器九两，大红锦呢被子一条，红锦呢衣面一件及银头夹、银戒子、粮食、布等物件，厂部决定登记送还各地政府转给群众。同时工厂附近××村，在自由思想中，自觉反省出群众给工厂驮脚多领工厂运费八千元，由该村政治主任亲自送还工厂，双方检讨极为融洽。（吕炎）
