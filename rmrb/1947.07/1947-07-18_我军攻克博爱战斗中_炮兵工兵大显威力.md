Our Army's Capture of Bo'ai Battle
Artillery and Engineers Display Great Power

[This newspaper reports] Frontline, Northern Henan, Comrade Wang Minzhao reports: The capture of Bo'ai demonstrates the effectiveness of the Taihang People's Liberation Army's efforts to seize gaps in battle to train troops and improve combat effectiveness. Daring to combine with technology has become a conscious thought and action for all commanders and fighters. Before the attack, the assault troops and firepower were carefully organized. As soon as the signal flare was fired, all firepower was deployed, sealing off all enemy bunkers and gun emplacements. The enemy did not even have time to return fire, and within five to fifteen minutes, they had crossed the outer moat, scaled the city wall, and broken through the breach. Various caliber shells accurately hit and destroyed the enemy's strong bunkers, sweeping the city's numerous bunker complexes and covering the infantry's rapid expansion, making outstanding contributions. The remaining enemies stubbornly resisted in three connected bunkers in the southeast corner of the city wall. Engineer squad leader Guo Ruizhang and squad members Yang Tongxin and Wang Yongcheng, disregarding the enemy's fierce artillery fire, approached and installed explosives, sending one bunker "flying," killing five people, capturing forty-eight alive, and seizing more than forty rifles, three machine guns, forcing the remaining 120-odd enemies in the other two bunkers to surrender. This battle, after precise arrangement and organization, combined with the wisdom of the masses, clarified each unit's attack tasks and assault directions, dispersed the attacking formation, and moved quickly and quietly. The breakthrough and expansion were exceptionally rapid. Therefore, despite the enemy's stubborn resistance in the strong fortifications and street fighting, a great victory was achieved with only minor casualties. Furthermore, after the Liberation Army entered Bo'ai, discipline was excellent, and not a single item was violated. The reporter entered the city half an hour after the battle's conclusion. Except for the city defense troops, all attacking troops had completely withdrawn to the suburbs, and the city work teams began clearing operations. There was not a single gunshot around the city, and vendors in the city and station had resumed business. The city was quiet and orderly. Old men, strong men, women, and children in each household leaned against their doors, watching the passing people's soldiers and staff with smiles, as if looking up to long-separated relatives returning home. Except for the city work teams collecting enemy materials, checking household registrations, and visiting the masses, the army did not enter civilian houses at all. Soldiers who had just put down their guns picked up pens, and within an hour, the city and its four gates were covered with our army's slogans. The masses praised our army as a "benevolent and righteous army."
