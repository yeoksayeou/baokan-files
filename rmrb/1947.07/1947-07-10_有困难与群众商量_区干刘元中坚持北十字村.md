Consulting the Masses in the Face of Difficulties
District Cadre Liu Yuanzhong Persists in Beishizi Village
    Li Ping, Zhi Quan, Han Qing
    The masses in Beishizi Village, Bo'ai, Taihang, have raised their awareness and voluntarily overthrown the "Maintenance Association."
    This village is located seventeen li east of Bo'ai, seven li west of Danhepud (a former enemy stronghold), and only ten li south of the Qin-Bo highway, placing it in a very tense guerrilla environment. In the winter before last, after the enemy occupied Bo'ai, most of our cadres and militiamen retreated to the mountains. Landlords and despots like Liu Chengkui and Liu Chenggong colluded with the enemy and the "Homecoming Corps," threatening the masses of Beishizi three times to "maintain" the enemy, and spreading rumors that the farmers' association and militiamen on the mountain would never return, and that the county and district cadres had all been defeated! The masses dared not speak in the village, dared not cultivate the land allocated to them, and were often robbed by the Chiang army on their way to Bo'ai city to do petty business. In particular, the Chiang army looted the village on the seventh day of the first lunar month this year. Out of more than two hundred households, one hundred and forty were robbed. Under duress, the masses "maintained" the enemy.
    This spring, the leadership proposed launching a mass-based guerrilla war and fully carrying out the anti-liquidation movement. Comrade Liu Yuanzhong, a district cadre, led ×× militiamen back and took the first step by overthrowing the local tyrant and landlord Liu Chengkui, but the masses were not very enthusiastic at that time. Comrade Liu Yuanzhong and others then went into the community to listen to the masses and found that there were three unresolved issues in the minds of the masses: (1) the difficulty of solving their livelihood problems. The village had always relied on men selling jelly and women weaving to make a living, but since the Chiang army occupied the area, they were forced to stop; (2) they were dissatisfied with the withdrawal of cadres and militiamen; (3) they felt that although they were unwilling to "maintain" the enemy, they were afraid they could not resist.
    Based on the above three mental situations, Liu Yuanzhong believed that the guerrilla war and land reform could only be carried out by solving the urgent livelihood problems of the masses. He organized sixteen jelly stalls and issued travel permits and grain purchase certificates to them, taking turns to buy beans and cotton in the base area of × village in the mountains to solve the raw material difficulties for making noodles, jelly and weaving. However, the masses' enthusiasm was still not high, and there were still concerns about production. When Comrade Liu Yuanzhong saw that the masses were afraid of them leaving, he openly stated his attitude: "I will resolutely not leave, I will share life and death with everyone!" At that time, someone suggested, "As long as the cadres make the decisions, we dare to do it, but we are afraid that there are still informers leaking information!" Liu Yuanzhong asked everyone to come up with a solution. The discussion resulted in the need to "pan for gold in the sand" and form five-household mutual protection groups to protect their homes and fields, on the condition that they would not work for the enemy or harbor bad people. At that time, Jiao Xiqing, the uncle of the landlord "Homecoming Corps" member Liu Pengjie, was isolated. No one was willing to form a mutual protection group with him. Helplessly, he promised the masses, "I will never go to Bo'ai city again, and I will never be an informer!" and broke off his relationship with Liu Pengjie.
    The work had only just begun, and three more informers fled to the city, which increased the masses' concerns, especially among the older people, who went to Liu Yuanzhong and said, "The Eighth Route Army is a country, and they (the Kuomintang) are also a country, so let's send them some grain and money to take care of them!" Liu Yuanzhong then asked the masses to discuss, "Is it right to take care of the enemy? Can we withstand the maintenance?" Liu Shubo said, "This guy (referring to Chiang) is not trustworthy, and maintenance will not stop the looting. They not only loot in the village but also on the road. I worked hard for four or five months and earned two pieces of cloth, but that time when I walked to Sigou, they were robbed by someone, and I almost lost my head!" Liu Sujin said, "It's better to resist than to maintain the enemy. The Kuomintang drinks the water from the well and then defecates in the well. It's better not to feed a dog to bite our own people." Liu Quanyuan and others cited examples from several villages nearby, saying, "The enemy is like a fox eating chickens at night, eating one after another. After Zhuangtou Village 'maintained,' the amount of money to be paid per mu increased to 110,000 yuan, and six more strong men were needed, but they still robbed. Even in Beishizi Village, last time we paid 100,000 yuan at one time, and then another note came demanding 100,000 yuan." Activist Li Xiyi jumped up and said, "Now we must have the determination of a widow remarrying (sacrifice) and fight Chiang Kai-shek and the local tyrants to the end, so that we can have our own way out." These words revealed the thoughts of many people, "One hand cannot clap, we must work together." It became the demand of the masses, so the Farmers' Association doubled in size, and the militia and self-defense forces accounted for 20% of the village's population. All the clay cannons and old-fashioned rifles were brought out, and the village was sealed off with landmines. There was also an "air raid alarm". When the enemy came, the bell would ring from afar to every home, and the whole village was like a large military camp, causing the enemy to repeatedly fail. Later, when the enemy went to Xiaozhuang, fifteen li away from Beishizi, to rob grain, they panicked and fled back to the city as soon as they heard that someone from Beishizi was coming.

　　有困难与群众商量
  　区干刘元中坚持北十字村
    李平　执权　寒青
    太行、博爱北十字村群众觉悟提高，自动推垮“维持”。
    该村东离博爱十七里，西距丹河铺（原敌据点）七里，南去沁博公路仅十里，处在斗争十分紧张的游击环境中。前年冬敌占博爱后，我干部民兵大部撤上山，地主恶霸刘成魁、刘成功等结合敌军与“还乡团”，三次来威逼北十字群众“维持”，并散翻谣言说：山上农会、民兵永也回不来啦！县区干部都被打啦！群众在村里话不敢说，分配的土地不敢种，到博爱城里做小买卖，常被蒋军劫路，尤其是今年正月初七蒋军洗劫了一次村庄、二百多户的人家就有一百四十户遇劫，群众在逼的不得已的情况下，“维持”了敌人。
    今年春天，领导上提出开展群众性的游击战争，全力进行反倒算运动。区干部刘元中同志带领××个民兵，回去头一炮斗倒恶霸地主刘成魁，但当时群众的劲头不大。刘元中同志等便深入访问，听群众谈知心话，发现群众存在着三个思想未解决，即：（一）生活困难无法解决，该村向来是靠男人卖凉粉，女人纺织渡日，自蒋军占领后即被迫停止；（二）对干部民兵撤走不满意；（三）觉得虽不愿“维持”敌人，又怕顶不住。
    根据以上三种思想情况，刘元中认为只有解决群众当前迫切要求的生活问题，游击战争土地改革才能开展起来。便组织了十六个卖凉粉挑子，并开给路条、购粮证，轮流到山上根据地×村一带买豆子、买棉花、解决做粉条，凉粉与纺织的原料困难。但群众情绪仍未提高，生产上仍有顾虑，刘元中同志看到群众怕他们走，便公开表示态度说：“我坚决不走，要跟大家一起同生死共患难”！当时有人提出“只要干部作主，俺们就敢干，就怕还有透气筒走漏了消息”！刘元中便让大家想办法，讨论结果认为要“沙里澄金”成立保家保田团结自卫的五家连环保，条件是不给敌人办事，不包庇隐藏坏人等。当时便把地主“还乡团”刘鹏杰舅父焦喜清孤立起来，谁也不愿跟他结连环保，他无可奈何地向群众保证“以后绝不进博爱城，绝不当透气筒！”并与刘鹏杰脱离甥舅关系。
    工作才开始，还有三个透气筒逃到城里，当时增加了群众不少顾虑，特别是上年纪的人，找上刘元中说：“八路军是个国家，人家（国民党）也是个国家，给人家送些粮款，照应一下吧！”刘元中便让群众讨论，“照应敌人对不对？维持顶住顶不住”？刘树柏说：“这家伙（指将军）喂不熟，维持也断不了抢，不但在村而且在路上也抢，我四、五个月辛辛苦苦生产赚了两个布，那回走到泗沟叫人家人抢走了，差点没有丢了脑壳”！刘素金说：“维持不如硬顶，国民党吃了那井水，还往井里屙，自己喂狗来咬自己人，不如不喂。刘全元等举了左近几个村为例说：“敌人好比夜里狐狸吃鸡，吃了一只又一只，庄头村维持后，每亩出款增到十一万元，另外要壮丁六个，但是还照样抢；即以北十字村来说吧，上次一次就出了十万元，紧接着又来个条子要十万元”。积极分子李喜义跳起来说：“现在咱们要拿出嫁寡妇的决心（牺牲），跟蒋介石和恶霸地主干到底，才能有自己的活路”，这一句话道破了许多人的心思，“一只手拍不响，非合伙干不行。”成为群众的要求，于是农会扩大了一倍，在民兵、自卫队的占全村人口百分之二十，把×门土炮，××枝土枪全部抬出来，村子周围用地雷封锁着，还有一种“空中警报”，敌人来了，还老远铃声便传到每人家里，全村象个大兵营，使敌人一再扑空。后来敌人连到离北十字十五里的小庄抢粮，一听见北十字有人来，便慌忙逃窜回城。
