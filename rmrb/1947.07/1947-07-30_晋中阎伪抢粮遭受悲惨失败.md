Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 28th. Yan Xishan recently concentrated about half of his remaining forces, approximately twenty regiments, in the triangle area between Fenyang, Wenshui, and Pingyao. Under the personal supervision of senior generals such as Yang Ai'yuan and Zhao Chengshou, he launched a large-scale grain grab towards the rich Jinzhong plains, suffering a severe blow from the local armed forces, resulting in a tragic end of losing both men and territory. Yan regards this grain grab as a life-or-death struggle, as food is extremely scarce on the isolated islands around Taiyuan, with rice selling for 12,000 yuan per catty. In late last month, as the new wheat in Pingchuan was just ripening, Yan concentrated his main force of seven regiments, more than 10,000 men, advancing from the Taiyuan-Fenyang highway, controlling the communication lines, and dividing the area into small pieces to seize wheat by force. A unit of a certain unit of the Liberation Army annihilated the enemy's 216th Regiment of the 72nd Division in Xiaoyi Town, 15 miles south of Wenshui City, on July 4th, giving them an initial punishment. The next day, the enemy increased their forces from the Tongpu Railway, sending in the 46th Division, 71st Division, two regiments of the 40th Division, and one regiment of the 37th Division, totaling twenty regiments, advancing in multiple directions to search wheat fields and capture cadres. They even brought their own sickles and sacks to grab wheat along with the army, grabbing and transporting simultaneously. The Jinzhong local armed forces rose up to fight to protect the grain, achieving successive victories on the 20th and 21st, capturing Luocheng Town north of Fenyang City and Jiliyuan Town north of Wenshui City, and Xunyan Town southwest of Wenshui City, annihilating several platoons of the enemy and eliminating their grain grabbing strongholds. At the same time, the Xiaoyi guerrillas routed more than 300 enemies at Gaoyang Town, killing and wounding more than 30, forcing the enemy to not dare to run around everywhere. The struggle between grain grabbing and anti-grain grabbing is still continuing.

　　晋中阎伪抢粮遭受悲惨失败
    【新华社晋绥二十八日电】阎锡山近在汾（阳）文（水）平（遥）间三角地带，集中其残存全部兵力之半约二十个团，由高级将领杨爱源、赵承绶等亲自督率，向富饶的晋中平川发动大规模抢粮，遭受当地地方武装的严重打击，招致损兵失地的悲惨下场。阎贼对这次抢粮，目为生死搏斗，盖太原周围孤岛食粮奇缺，大米已卖到一万二千元一斤。上月下旬，平川新麦甫熟，阎即集中七个团万余人的主力，从太（原）汾（阳）公路进犯，控制交通线，划分为小块地区，武装抢麦，解放军某部一部，当于七月四日在文水城南十五里之孝义镇，一举全歼敌七十二师二一六团予以初步惩罚，次日敌即由同蒲线增来四十六师七十一师，及四十师两个团，卅七师一个团，连前共达二十个团兵力，分进合击，搜索麦田，捕捉干部，并以自备之镰刀口袋随军抢麦，随抢随运，晋中地方武装奋起为护粮而战斗。于二十与二十一日连战连捷，攻克汾阳城北之罗城镇与文水城北之蒺藜园，文水城西南之埙岩镇，歼灭敌数个排，拔除其抢粮据点，同时孝义游击队于高阳镇击溃敌三百余，死伤三十余，迫使敌不敢到处窜扰。现抢粮与反抢粮斗争，仍在继续中。
