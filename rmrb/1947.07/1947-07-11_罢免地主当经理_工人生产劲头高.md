    Landlords Ousted as Managers
    Workers Show Increased Enthusiasm for Production
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch] The Taihang Second District Federation of Trade Unions, upon learning the news from Xiangyuan Chengguan, its director, Comrade Ju Maode, issued the following call:

    I. Call on all factories to launch a class clarification movement, and conduct a major inspection based on workers' awareness. At the same time, in conjunction with this movement, conduct a review of membership; all trade union members of landlord class origin should be expelled.

    II. After the class lines have been drawn, for those targets of struggle who have committed heinous crimes, organize the worker masses immediately to pour out their grievances and wage struggle, expose their conspiracies, and after the workers have vented their anger, do not take any of the landlord's property, but return both the person and the property to the countryside to be handled by the peasants. Those of landlord origin, especially the young people and children, should be educated to separate from their original class, and restrict them from joining the trade union or contacting their families for two or three years. However, if they have made contributions in the factory and have truly separated from their former class ideologically, and can consistently serve the people actively, this period can be shortened as appropriate. Only in this way can we ensure increased production.

    III. After the "air raid shelter" has been breached, the main thing is to strengthen the education of workers, solve the various problems existing in the factory, and thoroughly awaken the workers ideologically, so that they can automatically launch production competitions, improve worker-peasant relations, labor-capital relations, and teacher-apprentice relations, establish a love-the-factory ideology and unity and friendship, so that the factory can be transformed and improved.

    罢免地主当经理
    工人生产劲头高
    【本报太行讯】太行二分区职工会闻悉襄垣城关消息后，该会主任巨茂德同志，特发出如下的号召：
    一、号召各工厂开展划清阶级的运动，在工人自觉的基础上开展大检查。同时结合这个运动，进行审查会员，地主阶层的工会会员一律开除。
    二、阶级界线划清以后，凡是罪大恶极的斗争对象，要马上组织职工群众诉苦斗争，揭露其阴谋，待工人出尽气以后，地主的资财一点不要，应连人带物交回农村由农民处理。地主出身的特别是青年、小孩，应教育他与自己的原阶级分家，并限制他二、三年内不准参加工会，不准接触家庭，但如他在工厂有功，而思想上又确已分家，能一贯的为人民积极服务，这个时间可以按情缩短。只有这样才能保证生产上升。
    三、“防空洞”攻破以后，主要的是加强教育工人，解决厂内所存在的各种问题，使工人在思想上彻底清醒起来，自动的开展生产竞赛，改善工农关系、劳资关系、师徒关系等，树立爱厂思想与团结友爱，使工厂得以改造与提高。
