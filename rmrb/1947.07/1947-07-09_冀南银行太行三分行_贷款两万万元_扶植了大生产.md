　　Jinnan Bank Taihang Third Branch
  　Loans 20,000,000 Yuan
    To Support Large-Scale Production
    [Our Newspaper] To support mass production, the Taihang Third Branch of Jinnan Bank has issued loans totaling 26,520,000 yuan. Farmers who have been liberated in various areas have used the loans to purchase agricultural tools and livestock, which has played a significant role in promoting production. In terms of industry, taking the coal and iron industries in the Changzhi and Yincheng districts as an example, over 15,000,000 yuan in loans have been issued. Combining mass capital, this has supported 101 finished iron furnaces, 17 bar iron furnaces, as well as bar iron rolling mills, boilers, and iron frying furnaces, and helped in the establishment of 24 coal kilns and one woodworking factory. In addition, bank cadres have been fully mobilized to go deep into rural areas to organize credit cooperatives, absorb idle funds from the masses, invigorate rural finance, and support mass production. From February to the end of May, after four months of efforts, 45 credit cooperatives have been organized throughout the sub-district, absorbing over 10,000,000 yuan in shares from the masses. In Licheng County alone, 24 cooperatives have been organized. The Xiaguihua Credit Cooperative, which began forming in early May, had issued 865,000 yuan in loans by the end of the month, helping the masses buy livestock and steel wire, and supporting the establishment of two small textile factories. Credit cooperatives have become organizers of active rural finance.
    [Our Newspaper Gao Yi News] This county has suffered repeated looting by the enemy and puppets, resulting in severe livestock losses. Each head of livestock is required to plow an average of more than 48 mu of land, and the lack of livestock has created a major difficulty in agricultural production. The Gao Yi Branch of Jinnan Bank has specifically issued agricultural loans totaling 10,060,000 yuan, lending to 71 villages (out of a total of 99 administrative villages in the county), uniting private capital of more than 20,000,000 yuan. The vast majority of villages have bought livestock, totaling more than 400 cattle, donkeys, and mules, reducing production difficulties. (Xi Xian, Shu Zao, Wan He)
    [Our Newspaper Jinnan, 7th dispatch] From January to May this year, Jize County produced 75,000 jin of saltpeter and 168,000 jin of salt, with a net profit of approximately 30,000,000 yuan.
