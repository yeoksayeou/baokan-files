　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: A diplomatic commentator for Izvestia recently wrote that Foreign Minister Hitoshi Ashida's recent demand for the possession of the Kuril Islands is a counter-offensive by arrogant Japanese militarists. On July 2nd, Ashida again raised demands for non-Japanese territories in the Diet. During the Lower House meeting on the 4th, Ozaki Yukio even proposed holding plebiscites in Manchuria, Korea, Taiwan, and the Ryukyu Islands. He further proposed unreasonable compensation "principles," according to which compensation should be calculated based on the losses suffered by both sides during the war, and that those who suffered less should compensate those who suffered more, as if the militarists were not aggressors but victims. The commentary continued: All of this is a direct result of the occupying authorities' condoning of Japanese militarists. Their inflammatory performances are not punished but encouraged.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: Tokyo dispatch: Japanese goods have begun to be dumped on overseas markets. MacArthur Headquarters International Trade Group has announced that Japan will ship a large number of cotton textiles to Ceylon and the Belgian Congo in the second half of July.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: According to a Central News Agency report from Shanghai on the 14th: The Japanese government has drafted a 1947 "Sino-Japanese Trade Plan" in preparation for the resumption of Sino-Japanese trade this autumn. The plan fully reflects the "Industrial Japan, Raw Materials China" viewpoint advocated by reactionary Japanese financial groups. The plan stipulates that Japan will export to China consumer industrial products such as bicycles, empty gas cylinders, watches, cameras, rayon, glass products, and chemical products, while China will export to Japan raw materials needed by Japanese industry, such as salt, sugar, soybeans, coal, animal hair, licorice, and beeswax. Among them, salt and coal account for the largest proportion, with salt stipulated at 600,000 metric tons, equivalent to 18 million piculs. The total value of Japanese goods exported to China is equivalent to more than 99.28 million US dollars, while the total value of Chinese goods exported to Japan is only more than 47.68 million US dollars, resulting in a trade deficit of 51.6 million US dollars for China. If this plan is implemented, it will be another major blow to China's weak national industry.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Tokyo dispatch: At MacArthur's request, the American Reparations Committee has again traveled to Japan on the 18th to study Japan's economic and industrial recovery capabilities and to reconsider the reparations plan for Japan. This trip by the committee is expected to result in a further reduction in the materials Japan will pay to the Allied nations and a further extension of the payment dates for reparations materials. Due to the protracted indecision over the reparations plan, in the past 20 months, Japan has taken the opportunity to convert its designated military factories and aircraft manufacturing plants, intended for reparations to the Allied nations, into penicillin and three-wheeled motorcycle factories. Many other designated reparations material factories have also been transformed into daily necessities factories closely related to the Japanese economy. According to senior officials of the MacArthur government, MacArthur's move is intended to establish a "friendly and well-fed Japan." Some American public opinion has fiercely criticized this, saying that "a friendly and well-fed Japan is equal to an arrogant and aggressively wealthy Japan."

　　日本军阀仍极骄横麦克阿瑟反予鼓励
    【新华社陕北十八日电】莫斯科讯：消息报外交评论员顷撰文称：日外相芦田均最近要求占有千岛群岛，是日本军国主义者骄横的反攻。七月二日，芦田均又在国会再次提出对非日本领土的要求。四日下院开会时，尾崎行雄竟提议，在满洲、朝鲜、台湾及琉球群岛举行公民投票。并进一步提出无理的赔偿“原则”，根据这“原则”，赔偿应以双方在战争时期所遭受的损失为根据来计算，而且应该由损失较少的赔偿损失较大的，好象军国主义不是侵略者而是处在牺牲者的地位。评论继称：所有这些，都是占领当局纵容日本军国主义者的直接结果。对于他们煽动性的演出，不予惩罚而予鼓励。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】东京讯：日货开始倾销海外市场。麦克阿瑟总部国际贸易组倾公布，日本从七月下半月将运出大批棉织品至锡兰及比属刚果。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】据中央社上海十四日消息：日政府已拟就一九四七年度“中日贸易计划，以备今秋中日恢复通商后实行。该计划充分显示日本反动财阀所倡‘工业日本、原料中国’观点。计划中规定准备自日本向中国输出者，为脚踏车、空卿筒、手表、摄影机、人造丝、玻璃制品、化学制品等消费性工业制品，至准备自中国向日本输入者则为日工业所需原料之盐、糖、大豆、煤、兽毛、甘草、密蜡等。其中以盐、煤占最大宗盐规定为六十万公吨，合一千八百万市担。日本输华货物总额折合美金为九千九百二十八万余元（九、九二八余万），而中国可输向日本货物总值仅为四千七百六十八万余美元），中国将因此入超五千一百六万美元（五一六○万），该计划如实施，对于软弱之中国民族工业自然又是一重大打击。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】东京讯：美国赔偿委员会应麦克阿瑟之请，已于十八日再度赴日，研究日本经济及工业之复原能力；并从新考虑对日赔偿计划。赔委此行预计日本赔偿盟国物资有再缩减、赔偿物资支付日期有再延续之可能。由于赔偿计划之拖延不决，在过去二十个月中，日本已趁隙将其指定供赔偿盟国之兵工厂及飞机制造厂，改装和制造盘尼西林和三轮摩托车工厂，其他许多指定的赔偿物资之工厂，亦均改造为对日本经济有密切关连的日用品工厂。据麦克阿瑟政府高级官员泄露，麦氏此举系欲建立一“友善及丰衣足食之日本”。美方若干舆论曾予猛烈抨击，谓“友好及丰衣足食之日本，即等于一侮谩及富侵略性之日本”。
