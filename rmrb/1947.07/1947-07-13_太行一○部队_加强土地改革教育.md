    Taihang Tenth Unit
    Strengthens Land Reform Education
    [Report from this newspaper] The Taihang Tenth Unit, in order to further clarify its class perspective and vigorously support the land reform movement, specifically invited Political Commissar Wang of the Third Military Sub-district to give a report on land reform at a meeting of cadres above the rank of platoon leader on the 23rd of last month. Initially, some comrades said, "The army should just fight battles! Why bother with land reform?!" However, when the report reached the new understanding of the land issue after the Central Committee's "May 4th" directive, combined with specific typical materials, everyone became very interested. In particular, the "land battle" tested the ideological inclinations of the cadres, such as pitying landlords; comrades of landlord and rich peasant origin initially didn't care, but when the struggle reached their own families, their attitude changed. Some, after marrying landlord women, abandoned their original class stance and sided with their fathers-in-law to oppose the emancipation of the peasants; some took advantage of the fact that their families had not yet been struggled against or had not been struggled against thoroughly to quietly sell off their property and speculate; some dared not face up to the peasants' inspiring struggle and were inconsistent with the peasants' emotions, etc., which hit the thoughts of many comrades and aroused heated discussions. It was mentioned how landlords cruelly exploited and oppressed the peasants, and how special agents sabotaged the masses' emancipation, but the peasants finally stood up under the support of the Communist Party and the democratic government and with the release of hands to mobilize, defeated the insidious landlords, and achieved a new middle peasant average of 4.3 mu of land per person, producing 6.1 shi of grain; poor peasants 3 mu, producing 4.8 shi of grain; extremely poor peasants 3.6 mu, producing 5.4 shi of grain; and hired laborers 4.1 mu, producing 8.9 shi of grain. Looking back at the landlords!? Landlords averaged 1.9 mu per person, producing 2.3 shi of grain; managing landlords 2.3 mu; producing 3.6 shi of grain; rich peasants 3 mu, producing 3.6 shi of grain. In the past, 92 percent of the suffering people now have food and clothing and are living a good life, and special care has been given to honorably discharged soldiers and military families. Finally, Deputy Brigade Commander Zhang said: "We are the people's soldiers, and in the future we will not only understand the emancipation of the masses, but also actively help the masses to emancipate themselves." It was also stipulated that in the future, each unit must take the initiative to find village cadres to report on mass movements to the troops, understand the suffering of the masses, and support the masses.

    太行一○部队
    加强土地改革教育
    【本报讯】太行一○部队为进一步明确阶级观点，大力支持土地改革运动，上月二十三日开排长以上干部会时，特别请三分区王政委做土地改革报告。起初，有的同志说：“军队打仗就算啦！还管土地改革干啥？！”但报告到从中央“五四”指示后对土地问题的新认识时，结合着具体典型材料，大家很感兴趣。尤其在“土地战斗”中考验了干部的思想倾向，如可怜地主；地主富农出身同志开始不在乎，当斗到自家时，态度就变了。有的娶地主女人后，抛掉原阶级立场，站到丈人立场上反对农民翻身；有的趁自家未斗或斗的不彻底时，悄悄出卖家产，投机抓一把；有的对农民可歌可泣的斗争不敢正视，与农民情绪不一致等等，正打中许多同志的思想，引起热烈的酝酿。谈到地主如何残酷的剥削压榨农民，特务破坏群众翻身，但农民终于在共产党民主政府撑腰与放手发动下站起来了，战胜了阴险的地主，而达到新中农每人平均地四·三亩，产粮六·一石；贫农三亩，产粮四·八石；赤贫三·六亩，产粮五·四石；雇农四·一亩，产粮八·九石。回头看地主呢！？地主每人平均一·九亩，产粮二·三石；经营地主二·三亩；产粮三·六石；富农三亩，产粮三·六石。过去百分之九十二的受苦人民，现在有吃有穿，过着好时光，并特别照顾了荣退军人、军属。最后张副旅长说：“咱们是人民子弟兵，以后不但了解群众翻身，还要主动的帮助群众翻身。”并规定今后各单位每到一地，必须主动找村干部给部队报告群运，了解群众痛苦，为群众撑腰。（刘志）
