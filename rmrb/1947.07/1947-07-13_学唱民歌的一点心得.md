    Some Experiences in Learning to Sing Folk Songs
    Xia Qing

    Comrade Xue Wei:

    I received your letter and feel quite ashamed. I've also done very little research on singing folk songs. In recent years, I've become even more unfamiliar with it since I no longer work in this field. I only sing a few lines occasionally when the mood strikes, so I can only talk casually about my personal experiences. Inaccuracies are inevitable, and I hope you will not hesitate to give me your advice.

    I believe that for those comrades who have studied Western vocal music, or who have not learned it well and make their voices sound like they're having the shakes, the first thing to do when learning Chinese folk singing is to restore their voices to a natural state and overcome the habits of Western singing. Take advantage of every opportunity to get close to the masses and mass artists, and learn (imitate) their singing methods. I say imitate because we already have a fixed habit with music, and we have a set of established rules for vocalization, expression methods, and concepts of scales. If we don't abandon these established rules, we won't learn well. For example, I met a comrade who, when learning folk songs, first used an old notation method to force the tunes sung by the masses into the framework of "12345…". However, we know that due to the characteristics of the nation and language, it is difficult to accurately record Chinese music using Western notation methods. As a result, what is sung sounds very different from the original tune. It sounds like a general song, not a folk song. Therefore, we must consciously break these established rules, force ourselves to imitate, and from imitation, grasp, experience, and research, and then create new scientific methods (singing and notation, etc.). Finally, create new national (folk) music. Otherwise, it is easy to consciously or unconsciously put our music into the tones of Western music, which would be a huge mistake.

    Naturally, in the beginning, this kind of imitation may sound very unpleasant, it may be shouting, and both oneself and others will find it difficult to bear, just as some people who are not interested in folk singing say: it is "shouting straight from the throat". But don't be discouraged by this. A beautiful Chinese-style singing voice will gradually be developed through practice. According to my experience, at this time, it is best not to hold an attitude of appreciation too much, appreciating one's own timbre, volume, etc., nor should one demand folk flavor or peasant sentiment too much. Instead, one should strictly demand a pair of objective ears. These ears must constantly and unceremoniously examine one's own voice and singing methods, and give strict criticism. When necessary, one should stop midway and start over. Like a beginner learning to read encountering a stumbling block, never let it go. Otherwise, it is easy to be deceived by one's own voice or emotions. I have encountered some comrades who do not work hard to learn, but are satisfied with their self-righteous "sentiment", which is actually still like singing "Drizzling Rain", only the tune and lyrics have been changed. This should be highly guarded against, because style and flavor can only be grasped after becoming familiar with the expressive methods of folk songs and mastering the thoughts and emotions of the masses.

    Another issue is language. We all know that the dissemination of folk songs mainly relies on oral transmission, so the combination of lyrics and language is very close. Often, the same tune and lyrics, when sung in different dialect areas, have great differences, so language learning is very important. Moreover, from here, one can better understand the characteristics of folk songs. I once tried this aspect. When learning to sing from the masses, I first mastered the lyrics, listened quietly several times, familiarized myself with them, and then learned sentence by sentence according to the pronunciation of the words, ignoring whether it was "123" or "234". This method may be very clumsy, but the effect is very good, it is easy to learn, and it also sounds a bit like the local flavor, not very much like "singing", especially when learning other folk songs in the same area later, the learning is very fast. And doing so will stimulate interest in the study of folk songs. For example, we know that folk songs often have only a few simple melodies, but the lyrics have many paragraphs. If you are familiar with the language, and you have mastered the preliminary expression methods and emotional understanding, then each paragraph seems to have different aspects. But if you force the tune onto the unchanged "1, 2, 3, 4, 5...", and then sing each word according to the notes prescribed by the score in Mandarin, there will be very little change, or even none. I am afraid that many people have this experience, so the study and research of language cannot be ignored.

    Finally, there is the issue of folk flavor and peasant sentiment. I feel that this is a very delicate and difficult problem, and requires a cautious and serious attitude. The best way to solve this problem is not to be impatient. Some comrades, because they are eager to achieve this step, avoid difficulties and take the easy way out, grasping the characteristics of folk songs in isolation, resulting in very slow progress. More importantly, they distort folk flavor, peasant sentiment, etc., and actually become, or almost become, vulgar tastes. I think the so-called style and sentiment are nothing more than using the characteristics of our national (folk) music (the composition of the melody, and the combination with language, etc.) to express the thoughts and emotions of the masses, as well as their views and attitudes towards nature, things, events, and people. It is by no means exaggerating individual special syllables, or a self-righteous peculiar musical phrase. So, if you want to truly master this, you must go deep into the masses, learn from the masses, not only learn their singing, but also learn their lives, thoughts, and feelings. Speaking of this, I feel that in general, those who are engaged in vocal music, or who aspire to do so, should preferably combine it with opera, because when performing in a play, one must first master the thoughts and emotions of the characters in the play, so that there will be more emotional basis, which is much more convenient than learning the expression methods of a folk song out of thin air. And this is also a new direction of work, which will be of great benefit to the combination of drama and music and the creation of new dramas.

    These are just empty, general thoughts. As for new folk vocalization methods, breathing methods, etc., I myself lack research. Your experience must be even more extensive. Generally speaking, as long as you have an honest and objective attitude, pay close attention to the sounds you make when singing and the changes in various parts of your body, treat yourself as a practical product, and study with other comrades, find out the successful and failed examples in your learning process, and conduct research, even if it is little by little, over time, there will be significant achievements.

    This article is just a collection of scattered thoughts, and only about the singing aspect, errors are certainly unavoidable. I hope you and other comrades will give me your corrections. I also hope to have more contact in the future and write more articles for "Literary and Art Communications".

    学唱民歌的一点心得
    夏青
    学卫同志：
    你的信收到了，读了很惭愧，我对唱民歌也是很少研究。近几年来因为不搞这门工作，更是生疏了。只是偶而兴之所至唱上几句，所以只能就个人所体验到的随便谈谈。不妥之处，在所难免，尚希不吝赐教。
    我认为对于一般研究过西洋声乐，或学得不好把声音搞的象打摆子一样的同志们，要学习民间（中国）唱法，首先必须使自己的声音回复自然，克服过去西洋唱法的习惯，利用一切和群众及群众艺术家接近的机会，学习（模仿）他们的唱法。我说模仿，是因为我们过去对音乐已有一种固定的习惯，对于发声、表现方法、音阶的观念都有一套陈规，如果不放弃这套陈规是学习不好的。比如我会见一位同志，在学习民歌的时候，首先用一种旧的记谱方法，把群众所唱的曲调硬塞在“１２３４５……”的框子里；但是我们知道，我国的音乐，由于民族和语言的特点，西洋的记谱方法是很难准确的记录下来的，结果唱出来以后，与原来的曲调相差很远。听起来象是一般歌曲，而不是民歌。所以必须自觉的去打破这种陈规，强制自己去模仿，从模仿中去捉摸、体验、研究，进而创造新的科学的方法（唱及记谱等等）。最后创造新的民族（民间）音乐。不然容易自觉或不自觉地把我国音乐，投到西洋音乐的调子里去，那样就要犯极大的错误了。
    自然这种模仿，在开始的时候，声音可能很不好听，可能是叫喊，自己和别人听了都很难受，正如有些对民间唱法没有兴趣的人所说的：是“直着嗓子吼”。但不要因此气馁，好听的中国气派的歌声，会慢慢练习出来的。根据我的经验，在这种时候，最好不要过分地抱着一种欣赏的态度，欣赏自己的音色、音量等等，也不要过分地要求民间风味，农民情调之类，而应严格地要求有一对客观的耳朵。这对耳朵，要不断地不客气地审查自己的声音、唱法，给以严格地批判。必要的时候，应在中途停下来，从头再来。象初学识字的人碰到拦路虎一样地，绝不放过。不然容易被自己的声音或情绪所欺骗。我曾经碰到有些同志，他不去刻苦的学习，满足于自以为是的“情调”，其实仍是和唱“毛毛雨”一样，不过曲调、歌词变换了一下而已。这是应该很好警惕的，因为风格、味道，只有在熟习民歌的表现方法，和掌握了群众的思想情绪之后，才能把握到的。
    还有一个就是语言的问题。我们都知道，民歌的传播主要是依靠口传，因此曲词和语言的结合非常密切；往往同一曲调和歌词，在不同方言的地区，唱起来有很大的差异，所以语言的学习就很重要了。而且从这里也更能了解民歌的特点。我曾经在这方面尝试了一下，在向群众学唱的时候，先把词弄会，静听几次，熟习它，然后随着词的发音一句一句的学，不去管他是“１２３”，或是“２３４”。这个法子也许很笨，但效果都很好，很容易就能学会，而且唱起来也有点本地的味道，不大象“唱歌”，特别在以后学习同一地区其他一些民歌的时候，学的都很快。并且这样做会激起对民歌研究的兴趣。比方我们知道，民歌往往只有几句简单的旋律，歌词却有好多段。如果语言熟悉，再加上掌握了初步的表现方法、感情的理解，那每段唱起来似乎都有不同之处。但是如果把曲调硬塞上不加改造的“１、２、３、４、５……”，再用普通话把每个字按照谱子规定的音一个一个唱出来，就会很少变化，甚至没有。这恐怕很多人都有这种经验，所以语言的学习和研究是不可忽视的。
    最后是关于民间风味，农民情调的问题了。我感到这是个很细致很困难的问题，需要有一个慎重和严肃的态度。解决这个问题最好不要性急。曾经有些同志，因为急于达到这一步，就避难就易，孤立地去抓民歌里的特点，结果进步很慢；而更重要的是把民间风味、农民情调等等歪曲了，实际变成了、或几乎变成了低级趣味。我想所谓风格、情调，无非是以我国民族（民间）音乐的特点（旋律的构成，和语言的结合等等），用来表现群众的思想情绪，以及他们对于自然、事物、事变、人的看法和态度。而绝非把个别特殊的音节，或一句自以为奇特的乐句给以夸张。所以要想真正掌握这个，必须深入群众，向群众学习，不仅学他们的唱，而且要学习他们的生活、思想感情。谈到这里，我感到一般从事声乐，或有志于此者，最好与歌剧结合，因为演剧的时候，首先必须掌握剧中人的思想情绪，这样感情的根据会多一些，比凭空去学一支民歌的表现方法，要方便得多。而且这也是一个新的工作方向，对于戏剧与音乐的结合，创造新戏剧，会有很大的益处。
    空空洞洞，只能谈这些，至于新的民间的发声法、呼吸法等等，我自己也缺乏研究，你们的经验一定更多一些。一般地说，只要态度老实、客观，密切注意唱歌时的声音、及身体各部分的变化，把自己作为一个实践品，多与其他同志研究，找出自己学习过程中成功和失败的例子，进行研究，那怕是一点一滴，日积月累，一定会有显著的成就的。
    此篇仅是零星感想，而且仅是关于唱的方面，错误一定难免，希望你及其他同志们给我指正。并希今后多联系，多给“文艺通讯”写稿。
