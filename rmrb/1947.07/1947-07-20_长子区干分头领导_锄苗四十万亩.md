    Changzi District Cadres Take the Lead
    Weeding 400,000 Mu
    [Our Newspaper Taiyue, 18th] "There is water on the hoe!" Changzi County is implementing weeding to combat drought. After the expanded cadre meeting last month, district cadres throughout the county went to the countryside to lead a concentrated weeding effort. In half a month, they weeded 400,000 mu of autumn seedlings throughout the county. After this rain, the leadership proposed, "Absolutely avoid relaxation and complacency, seize the opportunity to rush to weed!" They also organized all women, children, and semi-able-bodied laborers to go to the fields.
    [Our Newspaper Licheng News] In Henan Village, Fifth District, labor hero Zhao Muben implemented technical guidance on the @hoe in order to protect the seedlings and has now completed a round of weeding. According to statistics, the 72 mu of autumn land in his group has sorghum branches growing large, with one stalk branching into seven or eight. When @ing, three plants should be placed in one step, leaving two stalks in each placement. Generally, for sorghum, three plants are placed in one step, leaving three stalks in each placement. Using a hand hoe for both @ing and weeding has the advantage of making it difficult for the wind to blow down the seedlings and making the small seedlings drought-resistant. If the seedlings are too small (two inches) after the wheat is harvested, use a hoe to dig up the stubble. If they are larger (four inches), first plow the stubble and then hoe it. The small seedlings will be fertile and vigorous. Under the influence and promotion of this group, the whole village rushed to plant 98.2 mu of stubble, planted 277 mu of corn, 728 mu of sorghum, and 317 mu of corn. The entire village implemented technical guidance for @ing sorghum and weeding seedlings.
