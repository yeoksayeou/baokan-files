The Inner Mongolia People's Representative Conference was held in Wangye Temple in West Manchuria. It opened on April 23rd and established the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government, the highest local administrative organ in Inner Mongolia, on May 1st. At the same time, the closing ceremony of the People's Representative Conference was held. The Representatives' Congress paid tribute to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu replied in a telegram, saying: "The Inner Mongolian compatriots who have suffered hardships are, under your leadership, beginning to create a new history of freedom and light." The appearance of this free and bright new history is clearly reflected in the three documents passed by the Representatives' Congress: the "Declaration of the Inner Mongolia People's Representative Conference," the "Program of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government," and the "Provisional Organizational Outline of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government." We have only recently received these three documents and are publishing them below:

	Declaration of the Inner Mongolia People's Representative Conference

Looking back since August 15th, all Inner Mongolian people have fervently hoped that from now on they would no longer be oppressed by imperialism and Great Han chauvinism, that they would be able to obtain equality, freedom, and national autonomy, and that they would be able to realize the right to self-determination for all nationalities within China, as advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Unfortunately, the U.S.-Chiang reactionaries completely disregarded good faith, tore up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and frantically launched a civil war. They fundamentally negated the autonomous rights of ethnic minorities within the country in the bogus National Assembly and the bogus Constitution. Up to now, many areas of Inner Mongolia have been occupied by the reactionaries. The Mongolian people in the occupied areas have, without exception, suffered inhumane devastation. Countless Mongolian people have been killed under Chiang Kai-shek's policy of slaughter, and vast, fertile grasslands have become barren. However, the Inner Mongolian people are not lambs to the slaughter. For the sake of our own national liberation, we have persisted in and developed the autonomy movement, and persisted in and developed the war of self-defense, for the past year. During this period, we not only built the Inner Mongolia People's Self-Defense Army, giving the reactionaries' attacks a severe blow, but also established democratic governments in various leagues and banners of Inner Mongolia, universally raising the people's political consciousness, improving relations between Mongolians and Han, and improving the people's economic and cultural life. The face of Inner Mongolia has greatly changed, making the convening of this People's Representative Conference fully qualified. This conference was held in Wangye Temple from April 23rd to 29th. A total of 398 people's representatives from ten leagues and various banners outside the region attended, which can be described as an unprecedented grand event in the history of the Inner Mongolian people. The conference was convened in accordance with Mr. Sun Yat-sen's advocacy, Mr. Mao Zedong's ethnic policies, and the spirit of the Political Consultative Conference, and accepted the public opinion and demands of all the people of Inner Mongolia. The conference decided to establish the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government on May 1st, which is still the greatest happy event for our Inner Mongolian people in hundreds of years. This shows that we have achieved the initial victory in our struggle.

At a time when the international peace and democracy movement is growing stronger and the Chinese people's self-defense and liberation war has begun to shift to the offensive and will continue to achieve victory, we believe that this is a great encouragement for the cause of Inner Mongolian national autonomy. We are willing to solemnly declare the basic program and important principles of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government to the people of the country:

First, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government is a local democratic united government in which all classes of the Inner Mongolia people unite with all nationalities within the Inner Mongolia region to implement a high degree of regional autonomy. It is not an independent autonomous government, but a component part of the Republic of China.

Second, unite the Mongolian, Han, Hui, and other nationalities within the Inner Mongolia region, and unite all democratic parties that support Inner Mongolia's autonomy, as well as all nationalities within China, to completely smash the attacks of the U.S.-Chiang reactionaries and strive for the complete liberation of the Inner Mongolian people and all nationalities in China. All nationalities within the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are equal, and a new national relationship of close cooperation, unity, and mutual assistance will be established.

Third, ensure the people's freedom of body, religion, belief, assembly, association, and other freedoms. The human rights and property rights of all Inner Mongolian people, including farmers, herdsmen, workers, landlords, industrialists, businessmen, lamas, and former princes, etc., are guaranteed by the Autonomous Government. However, ethnic scum such as Mongolian traitors, Han traitors, and national traitors should be subject to the sanctions of the Inner Mongolian people and government laws if they have no sincere intention to repent.

Fourth, express unlimited sympathy for the tragic situation of Mongolian compatriots in the Chiang-occupied areas and their heroic struggle against the Chiang family's tyranny, and actively support them as much as possible. It is deeply regrettable that the number of representatives sent by Mongolian compatriots in the Chiang-occupied areas to this Representative Conference is still small due to the war. The Representative Conference decided that the Autonomous Government must listen to the opinions of compatriots in the Chiang-occupied areas at any time, accept their demands, and take care of their interests in various policies. Appropriate quotas will be reserved for senators in the Inner Mongolia Provisional Senate and members of the Autonomous Government, and we warmly look forward to Mongolian compatriots from all parts of the Chiang-occupied areas coming to jointly participate in the great Inner Mongolian national autonomy and liberation movement.

The above are just a few examples. Other details can be found in the Program of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government and the Government Organizational Outline. We sincerely hope that all sectors and nationalities throughout the country will, after the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government, provide guidance in the spirit of close unity and common liberation. We are eagerly looking forward to it.

    内蒙开始创造自由光明的新历史
    内蒙人民代表会议在西满王爷庙举行，于四月廿三日开幕，于五月一日成立内蒙最高地方行政机关内蒙自治政府，同时举行人民代表会议闭幕典礼。代表大会曾向毛主席、朱总司令致敬，毛主席、朱总司令复电中说：“曾经饱受困难的内蒙同胞，在你们领导之下，正在开始创造自由光明的新历史。”这自由光明的新历史的面貌，在代表大会所通过的“内蒙古人民代表会议宣言”、“内蒙古自治政府施政纲领”及“内蒙古自治暂行组织大纲”三个文件中明确的反映了出来。这三个文件我们最近才收到，特发表于下：
            内蒙古人民代表会议宣言
    回顾“八、一五”以来，内蒙古人民无不热烈期望从此以后不再受帝国主义与大汉族主义的压迫，能够获得平等自由与民族自治，并能够在将来实现孙中山先生所主张的中国境内各民族之自决权。不幸美蒋反动派竟丝毫不顾信义，撕毁政协决议，疯狂掀起内战，并在伪国大与伪宪中根本否定国内少数民族的自治权利，到现在我内蒙古已有不少地区被反动派侵占了，被侵占区的蒙古人民，没有例外的都遭受到惨无人道的摧残，无数的蒙古人民是在蒋介石的屠杀政策下被害致死，广大肥美的草原，变成了荒芜。但是内蒙古民族并不是羔羊，为了自己民族解放，一年以来，我们仍然坚持并发展了自治运动，坚持并发展了自卫战争。这期间，我们不但建设了内蒙古人民自卫军，给予反动派的进攻以严重打击，并且在内蒙古各盟旗建立了民主政府，普遍提高了人民的政治觉悟，改善了蒙汉间的关系，又改善了人民的经济生活与文化生活，内蒙古的面貌大大为之一变，使此次召开人民代表会议具备着充分的条件。此次大会是于四月二十三日至二十九日在王爷庙举行的，共到有十个盟及区外各旗人民代表三百九十八人，可谓内蒙古民族历史上空前的一次盛会。大会系根据孙中山先生的主张、毛泽东先生的民族政策及政治协商会议的精神，接受了内蒙古全体人民的公意与要求而召开的。大会决定于五月一日成立内蒙古自治政府，还是我们内蒙古民族数百年来一件最大的喜事，这说明我们已经获得了奋斗的初步胜利。
    际此国际和平民主运动日益强大，中国人民自卫解放战争开始转入攻势，并将继续取得胜利的时候，我们认为这对于内蒙古民族自治事业是一个极大的鼓励。我们愿将内蒙古自治政府的基本施政纲领与重要方针，郑重宣告与国人：
    第一、内蒙古自治政府，是内蒙古民族各阶层联合内蒙古区域内各民族实行高度区域性自治的地方民主联合政府，并非独立自治政府，它是中华民国的组成部分。
    第二、团结内蒙古区域内的蒙汉回等民族，并联合一切赞助内蒙古自治的民主党派、及中国境内各民族，彻底粉碎美蒋反动派的进攻，争取内蒙古民族和中国各民族的彻底解放。内蒙古自治区域内，各民族一律平等，建立亲密合作团结互助的新民族关系。
    第三、确保人民身体、宗教、信仰、集会、结社等各项自由，所有内蒙人民，包括农民、牧人、工人、地主、工商业家、喇嘛、以及过去王公等的人权、财权，均受到自治政府的保障，惟对于蒙奸、汉奸、卖国贼等民族败类，如无悔改诚意，则应受到内蒙古人民及政府法律的制裁。
    第四、对现在蒋占区蒙古同胞的悲惨境遇，及反抗蒋家暴政的英勇斗争，寄以无限的同情，并尽一切可能积极支援。此次代表会议蒋占区蒙古同胞因战事关系所派遣的代表为数尚少，深以为憾。代表会议决定自治政府必需随时听取蒋占区同胞的意见，接受其要求，并在各种政策上照顾其利益，在内蒙古临时参议会参议员及自治政府委员中，均保留适当的名额，热烈期待蒋占区各地蒙古同胞来共同参加伟大的内蒙古民族自治与解放运动。
    以上略举数端，其他均详见内蒙古自治政府施政纲领，及政府组织大纲。敬希全国各界及各民族于内蒙古自治政府成立之后本着亲密团结共求解放的精神，予以指示，不胜期待之至。
