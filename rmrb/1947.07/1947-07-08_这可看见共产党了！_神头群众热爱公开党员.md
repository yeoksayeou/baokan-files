　　"Now We Can See the Communists!"
　　The Masses of Shentou Love Openly Declared Party Members
　　[Further News] On July 1st, more than 500 emancipated farmers in Shentou held an unprecedentedly grand commemorative meeting. At the meeting, the representative of the Party branch committee loudly announced that comrades Shen Rui and Liu Jingyi were members of the Chinese Communist Party. Before the words were finished, the slogans of supporting the Communist Party and following the Communist Party shook the stage. Amidst the prolonged applause, the Communist Party members were welcomed to the stage. A thousand bright eyes were focused on the Communist Party members they had long wanted to see. In the melodious music, Feng Naigui, the director of the Women's Federation, hung three large fresh flowers on the chests of the Party members. Then, the emancipated farmers scrambled to express their thoughts. Emancipated farmer Shen Heshun said: "Two years ago, during the famine, my family had no grain and I fainted on the street. Shen Rui saw me fall, and he borrowed ten catties of millet to save my life." Then Comrade Shen Rui, on behalf of the Party, called on everyone to fight drought and conserve resources, pay public grain early, and support the front lines. The masses immediately responded and rushed to make plans. The meeting ended in a tense and pleasant atmosphere. After the meeting, the masses reflected: Now we can find the Communist Party members, and we must listen to them in the future! (Chongzhi, Hansan, Mulin, Siming)
　　[Reported by our correspondent from Wu'an] The masses of Nanyangyi warmly commemorated "July 1st". To commemorate this festival, the primary school students of Nanzhai rehearsed the Yangko dance overnight three days ago. On the morning of the same day, they wore bright red and green new clothes under the hot sun and sang happily: "Speaking of Taihang, talking about Taihang, Taihang is a good place, the Communist Party leads the good work, the people are living a good life." Early in the morning, the people of the whole village cleaned the streets, posted slogans, and women and children put on new red and green clothes to attend the meeting. After the Yangko dance, the meeting began. All the people solemnly saluted Chairman Mao. Comrade Zhi Yong'an, a primary school teacher, reported the history of the Communist Party's heroic struggle for the past twenty-six years. Then the village head and the director of political affairs called on the masses to think about which of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is good for us and what should we do now that the counter-offensive is underway, but it is not raining? Primary school teachers Zhi Yong'an and Shen Weisuan announced on the spot that they would save seventy catties of millet per month and be self-sufficient for the entire year at public expense. Then someone proposed that everyone discuss production and economy, drought resistance and famine preparedness in groups. (Qizhi)
