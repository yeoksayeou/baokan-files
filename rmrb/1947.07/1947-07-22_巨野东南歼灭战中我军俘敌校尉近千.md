　　Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 20th: After the annihilation of the Chiang Kai-shek's 32nd and 70th Divisions between Juye and Jinxiang, the number of captured field grade officers has been verified to be 940. This includes the 32nd Division's 141st Brigade's Colonel Chief of Staff Xu Hongcheng, 139th Brigade's Lieutenant Colonel Staff Officer Ma Xuejun, Lieutenant Colonel Engineer Battalion Commander Song Zhizhong, and the 70th Division's 140th Brigade's 279th Regiment Colonel Commander Luo Shishen. In addition, over 600 Chiang Kai-shek's 55th Division officers have been verified as captured in Yuncheng. The above-mentioned captured officers, totaling over 1,500, have successively arrived at a certain reception center.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 20th: Chiang Kai-shek's 70th Division Lieutenant General Commander Chen Yiding and Lieutenant General Deputy Commander Luo Zhedong, who had laid down their weapons, arrived at General Liu Bocheng's headquarters in a certain location on the 16th. On the evening of the 14th, the People's Liberation Army launched a general offensive against the 70th and 32nd Divisions besieged in the Liuyingji (south of Juye) area. When the two divisions were being encircled and annihilated, the 32nd Division Commander Tang Yongliang fled in panic with a small number of followers to Jining. The 70th Division Commander and Deputy Commander Chen and Luo each took an orderly, arriving at Zhileng Street at dawn on the 15th. Chen Yiding was holding a twenty-round Mauser pistol in his right hand and a submachine gun on his left arm. Hearing the sound of warhorses in the village, he thought it was his own troops and ran forward, asking, "Which unit are you from?" Unexpectedly, he fell right into the People's Liberation Army's trap. Chen, Luo, and the others immediately laid down their weapons and identified themselves.
