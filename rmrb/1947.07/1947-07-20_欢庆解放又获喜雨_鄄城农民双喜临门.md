    Celebrating Liberation and Rejoicing in Rain
    Juancheng Peasants Experience Double Happiness
    [This newspaper's report from Jilu豫 (Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region), 17th] Following Juancheng's liberation and subsequent rainfall, local people are, with the help of the democratic government, rushing to plant all the barren land. Since the county fell back into the hands of the Kuomintang (Chiang) army this spring, there had been no rain for three months. Autumn crops such as millet and corn could not be planted. Furthermore, the Kuomintang army forced the masses to uproot all the sorghum seedlings that had grown to three or four feet high, threatening them by saying: "For every sorghum plant left, a bullet will be the penalty; if half a mu is left, you will be beheaded." Juancheng, under the rule of these devils, was left with nothing but a vast expanse of wasteland. This contrasted sharply with the green shade everywhere in the liberated areas, truly like comparing hell and paradise. On the evening of June 30th, our Liu-Deng counter-offensive army crossed the Yellow River to the south, and the people of Juancheng were liberated. The next day, there was widespread rainfall, and the masses joyfully spread the word, saying: "This is the blessing brought to us by the Eighth Route Army, truly a double happiness!" The liberated people are now responding to the call of the democratic government, making every effort to rush to cultivate and plant all the barren land. Because almost all the oxen were looted by the Kuomintang army, personnel from the Juancheng Democratic Government are personally going to the villages to help the masses organize mutual aid, with people pulling plows and seeders, to quickly complete the sowing, ensuring that not a single mu of land is left uncultivated, and cooperating with the great victory.

    欢庆解放又获喜雨
    鄄城农民双喜临门
    【本报冀鲁豫十七日电】鄄城解放后喜雨，当地人民正在民主政府帮助下，抢种全部荒地。该县自今春再陷于蒋军手中后，三个月来久旱不雨，谷子、棒子等秋苗皆未种上，而蒋军复强迫群众将已长达三四尺高的高粱苗全部拔光，威胁群众说：“留一棵高粱，罚一颗子弹，留半亩就该杀头。”恶魔统治下的鄄城，只剩下茫茫一片荒野，与解放区遍地绿荫相对照，实不啻地狱与天堂。上月三十日晚，我刘、邓反攻大军南渡黄河，鄄城人民首获解放，翌日天又普降甘霖，群众欢欣传告说：“这是八路军给咱带来的福，真是双喜临门啊！”解放了的人民现正响应民主政府号召，全力抢耕抢种全部荒地。由于耕牛几被蒋军抢完，鄄城民主政府人员亲自下乡帮助各村群众，组织互助人拉犁拉耧，迅速完成播种，保证不荒一亩地，配合大胜利。
