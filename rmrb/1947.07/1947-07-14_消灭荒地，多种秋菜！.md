    Eliminate Wasteland, Plant More Autumn Vegetables!
    Today's newspaper reports that in the Sixth District of Anyang, it was originally thought that wasteland had been eliminated. However, after a thorough inspection, as many as 820 mu of ripe wasteland and unallocated land were found in Fucheng and Xijiang villages alone, a shocking number. According to our understanding, this phenomenon exists to varying degrees in various places, and should arouse the serious attention of leading comrades. They should instruct village cadres to conduct thorough inspections and avoid carelessness!
    Although there has been widespread rainfall in various places recently, the season is late, and in many places it is already too late to plant late crops. The hottest period of summer has not yet passed, and the remedy is to prepare seeds as soon as possible and plant autumn crops in large quantities. As the saying goes, "Bran and vegetables provide half a year's food." In 1943, various places benefited greatly from planting more autumn vegetables, and this year it is still necessary to vigorously promote this and make another effort.
    Responsible comrades in counties and districts should immediately regard planting short-cycle crops and autumn vegetables as an important link in leading production work in the future. This is the last and most important measure to prevent famine this year, and it is even more necessary to dispatch a large number of cadres to go deep into the masses to organize and lead.
    County and district federations of cooperatives, as well as village cooperatives, must highly promote the spirit of serving the people, and promptly prepare short-cycle crop and autumn vegetable seeds for the masses, selling them at low prices. In addition, neighboring villages and families should promote the spirit of "farmers all over the world are one family" and implement social adjustment. In short, we must work together to achieve "every village plants, every family has vegetables to eat," in order to make up for the shortcomings of the spring drought and poor harvest.

    消灭荒地，多种秋菜！
    今天报载：安阳六区原先认为荒地消灭，但经过切实检查以后，仅阜城、西蒋两村，即发现熟荒及未分配的土地达八百二十亩，数目惊人。据我们了解，这种现象，各地也或多或少的存在，应引起领导同志严重注意，责令各村干部，切实检查，万勿大意！
    最近各地虽已普遍降雨，但节令晚了，有很多地方种晚庄稼已经嫌迟。暑伏未过，补救的办法，就是及早准备种子，大量种秋工。俗话说“糠菜半年粮”，四三年各地因为多种了秋菜，沾光很大，今年还须大大提倡，再努一把力。
    各县区负责同志，应即把种小日月庄稼、秋菜看成今后领导生产工作的重要环节。这是今年防荒最后最重要的一着，更须分散大批干部。深入群众组织领导。
    各地县联社、区联社及各村合作社，要高度发扬为人民服务精神，及时给群众准备小日月庄稼、秋菜种子，廉价出售。此外邻村与邻家，要发扬“天下农民是一家”的精神，实行社会调剂。总之要同心协力，做到“村村都种上，家家有菜吃”，以弥补春旱歉收之不足。
