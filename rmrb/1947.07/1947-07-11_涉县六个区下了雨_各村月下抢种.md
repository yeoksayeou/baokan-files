    Shexian County's Six Districts Receive Rain
    Villages Rush to Plant Under the Moonlight
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] In order to strengthen drought resistance and prepare for famine, the Shexian County Party Committee convened a meeting of responsible comrades from various organs on the 2nd of this month to study specific work for production and famine preparation. On one hand, the County Party Committee issued an emergency appeal, and on the other hand, it extracted twenty comrades from various organs to form a shock team, going to the countryside that day to carry out this work. On the afternoon of that day, most villages in the second, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, and eighth districts received two to four finger-widths of rain. The comrades who went to the third district passed through the fourth district and conducted mobilization in each village. In order to urgently mobilize and rush to plant and replant, the Third District Party Committee quickly notified the main cadres of each village to come to the district office at night. They talked as soon as they arrived, and left as soon as they finished talking. They mainly calculated time based on the solar terms. The Lesser Heat solar term was approaching, and it was imperative to plant the land. They dispelled the masses' thoughts of waiting for more rain and fearing throwing away seeds, and emboldened the masses. The cadres of each village immediately went back to lead all male and female laborers, allocate drills and seeds, and organize planting under the moonlight.
