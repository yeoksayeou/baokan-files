　　【Huguan News from this Newspaper】After sowing, based on the masses' reflection that "exchanging labor is good, but we are afraid of not being able to clear accounts if there is a beginning but no end, and earning a lot of money, but we are afraid of not being able to divide the profits," a movement to clear labor, settle accounts, and distribute profits was launched. The county specially organized wealth-building teams to go to the countryside to clean up. In this movement, the masses clarified that mutual aid and large-scale labor exchange are the best way to become wealthy. After clearing the accounts of the previous period, everyone shared the profits, consolidated and developed mutual aid and large-scale labor exchange, and immediately launched a drought resistance and seedling cultivation movement. For example, Nanzhuang in the Third District consolidated mutual aid and large-scale labor exchange. As soon as Guo Xiaozhe's group finished sowing, they cleared labor and settled accounts, and distributed more than 53,600 yuan in profits earned from spinning, weaving, transportation, and milling in the spring plowing according to the amount of remaining labor. The most distributed was more than 3,200 yuan, and the least was more than 1,300 yuan. After such clearing of labor, settlement of accounts, and distribution of profits, the morale of the masses was greatly improved. For example, Cheng Huaixing said: "I was sick the year before last, and I couldn't even find someone to get medicine. This year, I was sent on errands, and not only did my family plant the land for me, but I also got a share of the profits. If we hadn't organized and implemented large-scale labor exchange, it really wouldn't have worked!" The whole group unanimously agreed that mutual aid and labor exchange are essential, and then the whole group discussed and formulated a seedling cultivation and sideline plan. Dongshanhou Village developed large-scale labor exchange after clearing labor and distributing profits. Lao Shuang initially did not want to participate in labor exchange and did not want labor tickets, and was willing to secretly plow the land for others to earn wages. After the village's labor exchange team distributed profits, each remaining worker received 365 yuan in cash and 3.5 jin of rice. He saw that participating in the labor exchange team earned more rice than plowing the land privately, so he repeatedly asked for labor tickets to participate in the labor exchange team. For example, Guo Bao in the Second District organized auxiliary labor to participate in production and replace full labor for transportation to earn money, which was also developed on the basis of clearing labor and settling accounts. On this solid foundation, the county completed drought resistance and seedling cultivation of 286,000 mu within half a month. The experience of this period is: focusing on agriculture, extracting labor to engage in sideline occupations, dividing agricultural and sideline work, achieving mutual results, and distributing profits according to remaining labor. Clarifying the power of organization from diligent accounting and profit sharing, mutually promoting and consolidating large-scale labor exchange, can improve the production movement! (Liang Yu)

　　【Pingshun News from this Newspaper】Yangjingdi Village in the Fifth District not only rushed to plant seedlings quickly, but also paid attention to planting techniques. 173 mu of cotton, 510 mu of Golden Queen corn, and 600 mu of millet land. Now there is no shortage of seedlings, and the masses are very happy to say: "This year's soil is not good, but the seedlings are the best; it is not enough to catch the seedlings, but also to protect the seedlings and study the seedling cultivation techniques well." Now 173 mu of cotton have been cultivated twice, and Golden Queen and corn have also been cultivated once. In order to make the seedlings resistant to drought, it is advocated to cultivate small seedlings and cultivate early. 200 mu of the 600 mu of millet seedlings can be cultivated early. On June 19th, the three major teams in the village discussed seedling cultivation. In the discussion, everyone said: "The hoe is like three fingers of rain. This year's soil is not good, and the planting is particularly dense. After a rain, the seedlings will grow bigger in a few days. Cultivate one mu if you can cultivate a small mu, and calculate one point for a small cultivation. This year, Golden Queen should be cultivated four times, and topdressing should be applied for the third time. Now we should start the second cultivation." After the discussion, each team accurately calculated the labor force and formulated a seven-day seedling cultivation plan. Each mu of dense millet seedlings requires at least three workers. It is estimated that each mu requires 2.5 workers for contracted cultivation. After the village completes the cultivation in seven days, there will be 28 remaining workers to be extracted to engage in sideline occupations. Each team conducted technical challenges and selected inspection teams to check the quality of the techniques. The labor hero Liu Shengcai's team separated the good and bad cultivators, combined full labor with half labor, and combined good cultivators with bad cultivators, so that cultivators with poor techniques can also improve their techniques. The combination of agriculture and sideline occupations is good, and the remaining labor is contracted to engage in sideline occupations. (Jiang Wen)

　　勤算帐勤分红巩固互助
  　壶关半月锄苗二十八万亩
    【本报壶关讯】全县在下种后，根据群众“变工到好，就是怕有头无尾清不了帐，赚钱不少，就是怕分不开红利”的反映，接着就展开了清工算帐分红运动。县里专门组织发家队下乡清理，在这个运动中群众都明确了互助大变工是发家的最好道路。清算了前一段的帐目，大家分到了红利，巩固与发展了互助大变工，当即开展了抗旱锄苗运动。如三区南庄巩固互助大变工，郭孝则组下种刚结束就进行清工算帐，并将在春耕中纺织运输磨面所赚红利五万三千六百余元，根据剩余劳力多少分了红，最多的分到三千二百余元，最少的也分到一千三百元，经过这样清工算帐分红后，群众情绪大为提高。如程怀兴说：“我前年病着，连个抓药的人都找不上，今年我支差走了，不但家里给我种上地，而且我还分上红利，要不是组织起来实行大变工，可真不行呀！”全组一致认为不互助不变工不能行，接着全组讨论订出锄苗与副业计划。东山后村经过清工分红发展了大变工，老双开始对变工不自愿不要工票，愿偷偷的给别人犁地赚工资，经过全村变工队分红，每个余工分洋三百六十五元，米三斤十两，他看到参加变工队比私自犁地赚米多，所以他再三要求领工票，参加变工队。再如二区郭堡组织辅助劳力参加生产，替出全劳力运输赚钱，也是在清工算帐的基础上发展起来。在这个雄厚基础上，全县半月内完成抗旱锄苗二十八万六千亩。这一段的经验是：以农为主，抽出劳力搞副业，农副分工，互相做出成绩，按余工分红，从勤算帐勤分红中明确组织起来的力量，互相推动并巩固大变工，就能把生产运动搞好！（良玉）
    【本报平顺讯】五区羊井底村抗旱抢种下种，不仅抢种的快，而且都注意了下种技术。棉花一七三亩，金皇后土玉茭五一○亩，谷地六○○亩，现在一苗不缺，群众非常高兴的说：“今年垧土不好，捉苗捉的最好；光捉住苗还不行，还得保护好苗，把锄苗技术研究好。”现棉花一七三亩已锄过二遍，金皇后、土玉茭、也普遍锄了一遍。为了使小苗抗旱，提倡小苗小锄、早锄，六○○亩谷苗现有二○○亩小苗能早动手锄了。六月十九号，全村三个大队，讨论了锄苗，在讨论中，大家都说：“锄头三指雨，今年垧土不好，种的特别稠，落一场雨小苗几天就大啦，能小锄一亩锄一亩，小锄一分算一分，今年金皇后达到锄四遍，第三遍上追肥，现在就应着手锄第二遍。”讨论后，各队把劳力精确计算了，并订出七天的锄苗计划，谷地苗稠每亩至少须三个工，要算出用包工锄，每亩须二·五工，全村七天锄完还剩余廿八个劳力抽出来搞副业。各队进行了技术挑战，并选有检查团，检查技术好坏。劳动英雄刘生财队把锄苗好坏把式分开，全劳力结合半劳力，好把式结合坏把式，这样使技术不好的把式也能提高技术。农业副业结合好，剩出劳力包工搞副业。（讲文）
