　　Seizing the Rifle Stock Inscription
    Kong Zhaoxiang's Creation
    Shu Zhen
    In the Eighth Company of a certain regiment of Chen Geng's Corps, every soldier has a square piece of white paper pasted on the stock of their rifle, on which is written their determination, plan, shortcomings, and direction of efforts for meritorious service. We gave it a name called "Rifle Stock Inscription." It is a good method for leveraging collective covenants, realizing one's own determination plans, mutual supervision, and self-examination. In the Xiangning battle, it turned into unparalleled strength.
    This is the creation of Comrade Kong Zhaoxiang, the second "Jiao Wubao" of the Eighth Company. During the rectification movement, the Eighth Company reviewed its past plans for meritorious service and felt that they were too large, empty, principled, and not practical, so they redefined their plans. The most important part of this plan was the addition of several new contents: (1) Never bow one's head in the most difficult environment, but actively think of solutions; (2) Guarantee not to take a single thing from the masses, and earnestly implement the "Four Don'ts"; (3) On the battlefield, there is only forward, no retreat, no crying or shouting with serious injuries, and staying on the front line with minor injuries; (4) In terms of battlefield discipline, go in empty-handed and come out empty-handed, without taking a single thing. There were also their own figures for eliminating enemies and capturing weapons. The battalion introduced this situation to other companies, and each company automatically followed suit, forming a guiding principle for the soldiers of the Third Battalion, constantly guiding all the soldiers of the battalion forward.
    When the battle of Beishan in Xiangning began, the enemy stubbornly resisted with strong fortifications and deep trenches. The warriors of the Eighth Company erected ladders seven times under the enemy's intense fire. The ladders were too short to climb, so they actively thought of ways to find a breakthrough, and no one shouted about difficulties or complained. One squad infiltrated the enemy's depths along the gas line to conduct armed reconnaissance of the terrain. They were all wounded and unable to retreat. At this time, in order to preserve both people and weapons, they endured the pain and rolled down a five-zhang deep ditch holding their rifles. This unparalleled heroism and tenacity finally compressed the enemy on Nanshan.
    During the pursuit, the enemy abandoned many straw hats and belongings, as well as two bundles. In order to prevent everyone from taking things randomly, Yang Tianshui said as he walked: "Look at your rifle stocks, look at our plans?" This enlightened everyone's sense of discipline. Many people preferred to endure the sun rather than take a straw hat, and everyone would rather go hungry than touch the captured grain. The rifle stock became a collective covenant for meritorious service, and no one, especially oneself, should violate it. This method of mutual supervision and self-examination played a great role on the battlefield, ensuring that the army did not commit the slightest offense against the people wherever it went.

　　抢托铭
    孔兆祥的创造
    树桢
    陈赓兵团某部的八连，每一个战士的枪托上，都贴着一块方方的白纸，上边写着自己的决心计划、缺点和立功努力方向，我们给他起了一个名字叫“抢托铭”。它是发挥集体公约，实现自己决心计划，互相监督和自我检查的好方法，它在乡宁战斗中，变成了无比的力量。
    这是八连第二个“焦五保”孔兆祥同志的创造。在整纪运动中，八连检讨了过去自己的立功计划，感到庞大，空洞，原则，不切合实际，于是又重新定出计划来。在这个计划中，最重要的是增加了几个新内容：（一）在最困难的环境下不低头，要积极的想办法；（二）保证不拿群众一点东西，切实作到四不走；（三）在战场上，只有向前没有后退，重伤不哭不叫，轻伤不下火线；（四）在战场纪律上，空手进去，空手出来，不拿一点东西。还有自己的歼敌和缴枪数字。营里把这个情况介绍出去，各连都自动仿效，形成了三营战士前进的指针，时刻指导着全营战士前进。
    乡宁北山战斗开始时，敌人凭着强固的工事和深沟高垒顽抗着，八连的勇士们在敌人的密集火力下，一连架了七次梯子，梯子太短没法上，只有积极的想办法找寻地方突破，没有一个人喊叫困难或埋怨。有一个班顺着汽路插入敌人纵深，武装侦察地形，全部负伤，又退不回来，这时他们为了人枪俱存，忍痛抱着枪滚下五丈高的深沟。这种无比的英勇与顽强，终于把敌人压缩在南山了。
    在追击的时候，敌人遗弃了很多草帽和东西，还有两个包袱，杨天水为了防止大家乱拿，他边走边说：“看看自己的枪托，看看咱们的计划？”这样就启发了大家的纪律观念。许多人宁愿熬日头不拿草帽，大家饿肚也不动缴获的粮食。枪托成了集体立功的公约，不能让一个人更不能让自己违犯。这种互相督促，自我检查的作法，在战场上起了很大作用，使大军所至秋毫无犯。
