Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 29th—Since July 17th, the LUZhong People's Liberation Army has launched a widespread offensive against Chiang's troops along the Donglidian-Nanma line. After four days and nights of fierce fighting, it annihilated the 52nd Regiment of the 18th Brigade of Chiang's elite main force, the 11th Division, and the division's engineering battalion, totaling more than 3,000 men. In addition, it killed and wounded more than 4,000 men from Chiang's 64th and 25th Divisions. Including the 4,200 plus Chiang's troops annihilated previously (from June 26th to July 8th), the total losses suffered by Chiang's troops since the so-called "key offensive" in the Yimeng Mountain area has reached more than 11,000 men.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 29th—According to incomplete statistics, in the recent three months, Tancheng, Donghai, Linyi, and other five counties have disintegrated more than 12,500 Chiang's puppet troops through political offensives (including more than 500 regular troops and more than 12,000 Chiang's "Returning Home Corps" and "Self-Defense Corps"). Local armed forces alone, in continuous battles in April, won over the disintegration of 5,613 men from Chiang's "Returning Home Corps" and "Self-Defense Corps". In seven days, the Guajian District of Tancheng won over 35 pro-Chiang elements to return to the liberated areas, 30 Chiang's puppet troops surrendered with their weapons, and more than 2,000 Chiang's puppet troops fled and scattered. Since the main force of Chiang's army, the 74th Division, was annihilated in mid-May, morale has been low, and our call for Chiang's puppet troops to perform meritorious deeds to atone for their crimes has been particularly effective.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 29th—In the Qingdao-Jimo area of the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway, Chiang's puppet troops have been voluntarily surrendering to the People's Liberation Army with their weapons in the past month, reaching 35 people, including 3 second lieutenants such as Zeng Dingqiang, platoon leader of the 106th Regiment of Chiang's 54th Army, and technicians from Chiang's naval shipyard in Qingdao. A total of 3 machine guns and 10 rifles were brought in. The People's Liberation Army gave them generous rewards.

　　鲁中解放军激战四昼夜
  　再歼蒋军精锐七千
    【新华社华东前线二十九日电】鲁中解放军十七日起在东里店至南麻一线，对蒋军展开广泛出击，经四昼夜激战，歼灭蒋军精锐主力整十一师十八旅之五十二团及该师工兵营共三千余人，另毙伤蒋军六四师与二十五师共四千余人。连前（六月二十六日至七月八日）歼蒋军四千二百余人，共计蒋军在沂蒙山区发动所谓“重点攻势”以来所受损失，已达一万一千余人。
    【新华社山东二十九日电】据不完全统计：郯城、东海、临沂等五县，最近三个月在政治攻势中，已瓦解蒋伪一万二千五百余人（计正规军五百余，蒋记“还乡团”、“自卫团”等一万二千余）。仅地方武装在四月份不断战斗中，即争取瓦解蒋记“还乡团”、“自卫团”五千六百一十三人。郯城挂剑区在七天中，即争取三十五名附蒋分子回到解放区，三十名蒋伪携械投诚，二千余蒋伪逃亡四散。自五月中旬，蒋军主力七十四师被歼后，士气低落，我号召蒋伪立功赎罪以来，收效尤大。
    【新华社山东二十九日电】胶济路东段青（岛）即（墨）地区蒋伪，一月来自动携械向解放军投庄者达三十五人，包括蒋五十四军一○六团排长曾定强等少尉军官三名，及青岛蒋记海军造船所技师等。共携来机枪三挺，步枪十支。解放军当优予奖励。
