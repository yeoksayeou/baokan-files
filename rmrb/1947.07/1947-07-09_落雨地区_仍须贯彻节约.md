　　Rainy Areas
　　Still Need to Implement Thrift
    Editor:
    After the rain, some people's thinking became paralyzed regarding thrift and preparation for famine. They feel that since the land can be cultivated, there is nothing to fear, and they lack confidence in saving food and reducing expenses for famine preparation. Some people say: "That's great! If it doesn't rain, we'll be thrifty and prepare for famine, but now that it has rained, we don't need to!" And they're eating noodles again at noon. We believe this is very wrong. Although the land has been planted, it doesn't mean the grain has been harvested. Can we be sure that the rainfall will be even during the seedling growth period? No one can be certain. As the saying goes, "Prevent drought every year and thieves every night." If we have a bad year, we'll be in trouble if we don't practice thrift. This should be given attention!

### 落雨地区　仍须贯彻节约

　　落雨地区
  　仍须贯彻节约
    编辑同志：
    经过下雨后，有部分群众在思想上对节约备荒就麻痹起来了。觉得地能种了还怕啥哩，对备荒省吃减用没信心。有的群众说：“这就好啦！不下雨节约备荒，下了雨可不用啦！”晌午又吃面了。我们认为这是非常不对的，虽然地种上了，不等于粮食收回来，在小苗的生长时期是否能雨水调匀呢？谁也没把握，常说：“年年防旱夜夜防贼”，真要是坏年景，不节约就坏了，应引起注意才好！
