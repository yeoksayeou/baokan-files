Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, July 9th: The Northeast Daily recently published an editorial titled "Accelerate Work in Newly Recovered Areas," calling for vigorous mobilization of the masses in newly recovered areas to rapidly establish base areas. The editorial first pointed out: Since the summer offensive, our Northeast Army has recovered vast areas, including more than 30 cities, 8 million people, and over 2,000 li of railways. The liberated areas of East, West, South, and North Manchuria are connected as one, which is a sufficient condition for us to continue to develop our victory. However, it must be estimated that the Du [Yuming] troops will inevitably engage in a desperate struggle, which requires our arduous efforts. Therefore, carrying out work in the newly recovered areas has become an urgent task. The editorial continued to emphasize: The focus of work in the newly recovered areas must be placed in the countryside, mobilizing the peasant masses, implementing the policy of bold and unreserved action, completely following the will of the broad masses, resolutely settling the political and economic crimes of Chiang's puppet collaborators, traitors, and local bullies, allowing the masses to vent their grievances and bitterness, carrying out the land reform movement, thoroughly crushing the feudal forces, and enabling the broad masses of peasants to obtain land, houses, and various necessary conditions for production from the hands of traitors, local bullies, and landlords. In order to make the reactionaries truly bow their heads and the basic masses truly stand up, it is also necessary to resolutely eliminate all landlords, bandits, and reactionary armed forces, completely destroy the teams and "big rows" organized by the Chiang Kai-shek party, disarm the armed forces of local bullies and landlords, and establish a broad people's self-defense force and local armed forces. Launch a "gun raising movement" to suppress the conspiracies of the reactionaries, truly ensuring that the working people can display their power and cannot be violated. On the basis of mobilizing the masses, mobilize the vast number of peasants to join the main force, so as to more effectively annihilate the Chiang-Du troops.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, July 9th: The mass struggle for grievances and revenge in the newly recovered areas of Southeast Manchuria is closely integrated with the enthusiastic support for the front lines, and the movement is vigorously unfolding. Qingyuan City first settled accounts with Xing Kexu, the "model" Bao head of Xidajie Village, who was a counter-settlement landlord of the Chiang Kai-shek party. At the struggle meeting, an old woman cried and said: "My son was sick, but you forced him to work during the day and stand guard at night, freezing him to death! You owe me my son!" The entire crowd roared: "Xing Kexu, kneel down!" Xing Kexu immediately knelt down in front of the crowd. Farmer Liu Dongping accused Xing Kexu of forcing the people to repair fortifications when the ground was frozen last winter, saying: "If you can't dig it, you have to gnaw it open with your mouth." The masses thoroughly overthrew him at the meeting. The next day, the farmers automatically ran 50 li, spending two days and one night to capture a local bully landlord who had been the puppet Manchurian district chief for 14 years from the deep mountains and forests for settlement. Less than 20 days after the recovery of Heishi Town, the farmers held a struggle meeting of more than 10,000 people, successfully settling accounts with the local bully mayor Liang Junzuo. Now, the masses in the new districts of five counties, including Huadian, Panshi, Yitong, and Shuangyang, inspired by the victory of settling grievances and revenge, have automatically organized 1,300 stretchers and 700 carts to go to the front lines to participate in the war against Chiang and to protect the land.

    东北日报社论号召：
    工作重点放在农村
    加紧进行新区分田
    【新华社东北九日电】此间东北日报顷以“加紧收复区工作”为题，发表社论，号召大力发动新收复区群众，迅速建立根据地。社论首先指出：夏季攻势以来，东北我军收复了广大地区，包括卅多座城市，八百多万人口，二千余里铁路线。东西南北满解放区联成一片，这是我们继续发展胜利的充分条件。但须估计将杜军必定进行拼死挣扎，还需要我们艰苦努力，因此开展新收复区工作，就成为当前的紧急任务。社论继续强调提出：新收复区的工作中心必须放在农村，发动农民群众，贯彻大胆放手的方针，完全遵照广大群众意志办事，坚决在政治上、经济上清算蒋伪汉奸恶霸地主的罪恶，让群众出冤气，吐苦水，实行土地改革运动，彻底摧垮封建势力，使广大农民从汉奸恶霸地主手中拿到土地、房屋及进行生产的各种必要条件。为了使反动分子真正低头，基本群众真正翻身，还必须坚决消灭一切地主土匪及反动武装，完全摧毁蒋党所组织的团队、大排等。把恶霸地主武装解除，建立一个广大的人民自卫队和地方武装。开展“起枪运动”，镇压反动派的阴谋活动，真正作到劳苦人民耀武扬威，不可侵犯。在发动群众的基础上，动员广大农民参加主力，以便更有效的歼灭蒋杜军。
    【新华社东北九日电】东南满新收复区群众诉苦复仇斗争与热烈支援前线紧密结合，运动蓬勃展开。清原城首先清算了西大街村的倒算地主蒋党的“模范”保长邢克绪。在斗争大会上，一个老太太哭诉说：“俺儿有病，你强迫他白天出工，晚上站岗，把俺儿给冻死了，你赔我儿！”全场群众怒吼：“邢克绪跪下！”邢克绪立刻跪倒在群众面前。农民刘东平控诉邢克绪去年冬天地冻时，他曾强迫老百姓修工事说：“你挖不动用嘴啃也得给我啃开。”大会上群众把他彻底斗倒。第二天农民又自动跑到五十里外，费两天一夜工夫把一个当了伪满区长十四年的恶霸地主从深山大树林中抓回清算。黑石镇收复后不到二十天，农民举行了万余人的斗争大会，胜利的清算恶霸镇长梁君佐。现桦甸、磐石、伊通、双阳等五县新区群众在清算复仇胜利鼓舞下，自动组织了一千三百付担架，七百辆大车奔赴前线，参加抗蒋保田战争。
