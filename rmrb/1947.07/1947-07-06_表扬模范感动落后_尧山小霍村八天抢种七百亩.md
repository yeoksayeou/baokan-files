　　Praising Models Motivates the Laggards
　　Xiaohuo Village in Yaoshan Rushes to Plant 700 Mu in Eight Days
　　[Reported by this newspaper] In order to fight drought and overcome famine, Xiaohuo Village, Yaoshan District, carried out crash planting and harvesting. Cadres first exposed the masses' mentality of relying on heaven for food, established a mutual aid production committee, and used existing village cadres and people with rich production experience as members. Each team was based on the former substitute farming team, divided into four teams, and adopted voluntary combination to match teams and classes. All 90 livestock, 89 waterwheels, and various farm tools in the village were uniformly distributed to each team for common use. Work was compensated based on the heaviness of the work, and women's needlework was also counted as work points. Cadres went deep into the groups, personally took the lead, set an example, supervised and led, and promptly checked and praised models to motivate the laggards. During wheat harvesting, it was discovered that Zhang Shini, Zhang Bingchen, military dependents Zhao Luohei, Zhang Guifang, and others in the sixth group harvested 30 mu of wheat in one day, averaging 5 mu per person, and the harvest was clean. The Production Committee immediately praised them and gave them the honorary title of production model. The actual materials were used to educate the mutual aid groups, and the masses improved their understanding and had a more correct understanding of organization. Each group automatically formulated daily plans and checked their work. For example, Shini said: "Our group guarantees to complete the task of crash harvesting and planting in eight days. If we fail to complete it, beat me two hundred times with a stick." The whole village completed the crash planting of 696 mu of vacant land in eight days. (Yaoshan Small Newspaper)

　　表扬模范感动落后
  　尧山小霍村八天抢种七百亩
    【本报讯】尧山一区小霍村为了抗旱渡荒，抢种抢收，干部首先揭破了群众的靠天吃饭思想，建起互助生产委员会，以现有村干与富有生产经验的人为委员，各分队以过去代耕队为标准，分为四个队，采取自愿结合来碰队碰班。将全村牲口九十个，水车八十九辆，以及各种农具统一分配到各队里去共同使用。根据活的轻重来顶工，妇女的针线活也算工。各干部深入小组亲自带头，以身作则督促领导，随时检查及时表扬模范，感动落后。在割麦时就发现了第六组张十妮、张丙辰、军属赵洛黑、张桂芳等六人一天割麦三十亩，每人平均五亩，割的又干净，当时生委会即予以表扬，给一生产模范光荣称号。利用实际材料教育了互助组，群众提高了一步，对组织起来有了比较正确的认识，各组都自动的每天订计划，检查工作。如十妮说：“我组保证八天完成抢收抢种任务，如完不成棒我二百棒子。”全村八天完成抢种白地六百九十六亩。（尧山小报）
