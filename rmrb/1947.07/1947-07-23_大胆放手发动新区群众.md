　　Boldly Unleash the Masses in New Areas
    Hao Long
    Based on the preliminary experience of land reform in Yongji, I offer the following suggestions on how to boldly and universally mobilize the masses in new areas to turn themselves around:
    (1) Publicly and boldly call on the peasants to carry out the movement of "speak bitterness, seek revenge, oppose traitors, and settle accounts," and affirmatively tell the peasants: "Today is the world of the common people. It is time to avenge grievances, seek redress, and settle the general accounts, old accounts, blood and sweat accounts, and exploitation accounts with the feudal forces. Today's struggle has the support and backing of the Communist Party. Victory is certain." Only with such a clear stance and clear propaganda and mobilization can the peasants dare to take bold action.
    Some comrades may feel that this is too stimulating for landlords and despots. This is a new area, and such propaganda and mobilization may cause some landlords to run away, creating social unrest, which is detrimental to us. Obviously, this is a manifestation of a timid and compromising mentality. The result of this kind of thinking guiding the movement is that the masses will not be mobilized.
    To loudly call on the peasants to avenge grievances, seek redress, and settle general accounts and blood and sweat accounts will cause panic among the landlords, and some may even flee; but we should not be afraid. As long as we point out the path to the landlords and feudal forces in our policy propaganda: "Escape and sabotage will increase your crimes, but admitting your mistakes will lead to leniency," this will make our struggle develop more smoothly.
    Only promoting "land to the tiller" and land reform without clearly calling on the peasants to avenge grievances, seek redress, and settle blood and sweat accounts and exploitation accounts is a sign of a lack of boldness.
    (2) Do not fix base points, but ignite fires everywhere and let a hundred flowers bloom. The peasants in Yongji universally have seven thoughts, that is, they are afraid to struggle alone in one village. When it comes to struggle, the masses always say, "If everyone does it, I will do it too," and "If other villages struggle, I will struggle too." This idea shows that the peasants are afraid of being isolated and standing out, and they demand that most villages act together, so that the movement to turn themselves around is powerful, mutually supporting. Therefore, the leadership should adopt a bold and universal method of igniting fires to guide the current widespread development of the peasant movement.
    Some comrades still use the old method, trying to make a breakthrough from one point and slowly influence the surrounding areas. This kind of thinking is no longer in line with the current reality of the new area. Currently, we need to organize to ignite fires everywhere, and break through at several points or make breakthroughs across a whole area. How to ignite? One of Yongji's characteristics is that the area is large and there are few cadres. We conduct propaganda and mobilization in every village, holding "speak bitterness" meetings; a base point first holds several hundred or a thousand people at a "speak bitterness" rally, launching the "speak bitterness" campaign, and putting forward the slogan "The more bitterness is spoken, the more bitter it becomes, the more you speak, the more there is," encouraging the peasants with the most bitterness to lead the charge, so as to achieve universal "speaking bitterness" by drawing out the bitterness in others. After speaking thoroughly, we discuss the plan for going back to struggle, and stipulate the peasant association's discipline: no surrender, no compromise, no being two-faced, etc., and then draw up a struggle contract to make the peasants more united, in order to achieve breakthroughs at several points or across a whole area in a very short period of time. Some villages, in the process of comprehensive breakthroughs, first achieve a victory in a struggle, and then organize a parade to surrounding villages to demonstrate their victory and encourage and enlighten the surrounding peasants to rise up in struggle.
    (3) Convene various "fear-dissolving" meetings to unite and strengthen the peasant class ranks. The main method of exploitation by the feudal forces in Yongji against the peasants was high-interest usury. However, some of the poor peasants and hired laborers had no houses or land, and with their own hands, through genuine frugality, they saved a few *shi* of wages to lend out. In the current struggle against feudalism and exploitation, these poor peasants and hired laborers are afraid of struggle and liquidation, and some middle peasants are afraid that struggle will fall on their own heads, suspecting that the Communist Party is "fighting the rich whenever they see them," which hinders the unity and strengthening of the peasant class ranks in the struggle. Various "fear-dissolving" meetings should be convened among the peasants to explain that poor peasants and hired laborers lending out money is not high-interest usury. At the "fear-dissolving" meetings, put forward the slogan "Resolutely do not struggle against middle peasants." The Communist Party's policy is to "struggle against despots, not against the rich," and "struggle against feudalism, not against middle peasants." Explain that poor, hired, and middle peasants are one family, and problems within the family are resolved behind closed doors, secretly, and without struggle. We must resolutely struggle against the backstage bosses of the feudal forces to the end, to make them lose all prestige, and settle all accounts, old and new, in one stroke.
    (4) From publicly calling for secret "speaking bitterness" and deliberation, secret liaison and organization, to publicly "speaking bitterness" and openly struggling. The peasants dare not openly "speak bitterness" and openly struggle all at once. After they understand us, they dare to individually and secretly tell us their bitterness. In order to have more people participate in the struggle, be bolder, and have more plans, we should respect the peasants' request to keep secrets. At this time, the leadership should secretly contact those who have bitterness. When the masses who secretly "speak bitterness" in the "speak bitterness" group meetings realize that they must act, this is the time for open struggle. The leadership should seize the opportunity and boldly lead the open struggle. If the transition is not made in time, it will violate the principle of boldness and unleashing.

### 大胆放手发动新区群众

　　大胆放手发动新区群众
    郝龙
    根据永济的土地改革初步经验，对如何大胆放手普遍的发动新区群众翻身，提出如下几点意见：（一）响亮大胆的在农民中公开号召开展诉苦复仇反奸清算运动，并肯定的告诉农民：“今天是老百姓的天下，到了有仇报仇有冤报冤算封建势力的总帐、老帐、血汗帐、剥削帐的时候，今天的斗争，有共产党撑腰作主，非胜利不可。”只有这样明确的立场，明确的宣传鼓动，农民才敢大胆的行动起来。
    有些同志会觉得这样对地主恶霸太刺激了，这里是新区，这样宣传号召有些地主会跑，造成社会不安，对我们是不利的。显然的，这是一种小手小脚调和思想的表现。这种思想指导运动的结果，就将群众发动不起来。
    在农民中响亮的号召有仇报仇有冤报冤算总帐、算血汗帐，地主是会恐慌，甚至有个别的逃跑；但我们不要害怕，只要在宣传政策中给地主封建势力指出道路：“逃跑破坏加罪恶，低头认错能宽大”，这就会使我们的斗争更顺利的发展。
    只宣传耕者有其田土地改革，而不明确的号召农民去有仇报仇有冤报冤，算血汗帐、剥削帐，都是不大胆的思想。
    （二）不固定基点，到处点火，遍地开花。永济农民普遍的有七个思想，就是一人一村不敢斗争，一提到斗争，群众总是说“大家干我也干”，“外村斗我也斗。”这个思想说明了农民怕孤立、怕突出，要求大多数村庄一齐行动，使翻身运动声势浩大，互相依托。因此，领导上就要采取大胆普遍点火的斗争方法，指导目前农民运动的普遍开展。
    有些同志还用老一套的方法，想从一点突破慢慢影响周围，这种思想已不合目前新区的实际情况了。目前需要我们组织到处点火，数点突破或面的突破的斗争了。怎样点呢？永济特点之一是地区大，干部少，我们村村进行宣传动员，开苦人会；一个基点先开几百人千人诉苦人大会，开展诉苦，提出“苦是越诉越苦，越诉越多”的口号，鼓动苦大的农民打头炮，做到以苦引苦的普遍诉苦，诉透了就讨论回去的斗争计划，并规定农会纪律，不投降，不妥协，不当两面派等，然后订立斗争合同，使农民团结的更紧，求得在很短时期内做到数点或面的突破。有些村在全面突破中，先取得了一个斗争的胜利，就组织到周围村的游行示威宣传胜利，鼓动启发周围农民起来斗争。
    （三）召开各种解怕会，团结壮大农民阶级队伍。永济封建势力对农民剥削的主要方法是高利盘剥，但是其中有些贫雇农是无房无地、一人一手的真正是节衣缩食节下的几石工资粮放出去的，在目前反封建反剥削的斗争中，这些贫雇农民害怕斗争和清算，还有的中农怕斗争轮到自己头上，怀疑共产党是“见富就斗”，这便妨碍农民阶级队伍在斗争中的团结和壮大。在农民中要召开各种解怕会，说明贫雇农放帐不是高利贷。在解怕会上提出“坚决不斗中农”口号，共产党的政策是“斗霸不斗富”，“斗封建不斗中农”。说明贫雇中农是一家，一家人中的问题是关住门子擦黑洗脸解圪＠来解决，不斗争。对封建势力后台老板要坚决斗争到底，斗的他威风扫地，新帐老帐一笔清。
    （四）从公开号召秘密诉苦酝酿、秘密联络组织到公开诉苦，公开斗争。农民一下不敢公开诉苦公开斗争，当他们了解了我们之后，敢个别秘密的给我们诉苦，为了叫参加斗争的农民人多胆大计划多，就应尊重农民保守秘密的要求，这时，领导上去秘密联络苦人，在苦人小组会上待秘密诉苦群众觉悟到非干不行时，这就是公开斗争的时机，领导上就应抓紧火候大胆的领导公开斗争，如不及时转变，就又违犯了大胆放手的方针。（太岳分社）
