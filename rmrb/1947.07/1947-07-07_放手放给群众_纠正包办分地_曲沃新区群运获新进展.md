　　Letting Go and Empowering the Masses, Correcting the Practice of Substituted Land Distribution
　　New Progress in the Mass Movement in the Quwo New District
　　[Report from Our Newspaper in Taiyue on the 5th] The Quwo County authorities are inspecting the land reform movement before the wheat harvest, correcting the phenomenon of simply distributing land, starting from the urgent demands of the masses, and enlightening the masses. After the liberation of Quwo City, due to urgent tasks such as breaking through the city and participating in the war, the entire county did not enter land reform until the end of May. The county concentrated more than 130 local and outside cadres, and on May 17th, they went to various districts to hold meetings of activists, propagating current affairs to break through the "change of dynasty" thinking. Many areas conducted accusation meetings, and many people cried bitterly. When discussing "dare to stand up," some said, "The Eighth Route Army is not far away this time. All the way to the Yellow River is our people, what are we afraid of?" Some said, "This time, even Little Chiang Kai-shek (referring to local armed landlords) has been subdued. If we overthrow the 'oil workshops' (referring to cadres compiled by the KMT and Yan Xishan), we will dare to do it." Some said, "Last year we only turned over halfway, and the 'oil workshops' beat us. This year we must strike early." Everyone's emotions were high, and most villages formulated struggle plans, raising slogans such as "The Eighth Route Army fights for the world, the people sit in the country," "Unity is strength," "If you have suffering, tell your suffering; if you have grievances, report your grievances," and "Eliminate feudalism and seize land" from the search for the root of suffering to the objects of struggle. By the end of the month, within a week, eleven administrative villages had made breakthroughs. By June 1st, the entire county entered the wheat harvest, but the movement did not stop during the harvest. Many villages were brewing and harvesting wheat at the same time. The county took this opportunity to convene a joint meeting of group leaders from various key points. The meeting revealed that many villages had not properly addressed the entry problem, and some mechanically emphasized "the tillers should own their land," and simply regarded solving the land problem as the guiding principle of the movement, hastily taking the land of landlords and despots to distribute it. This neglected the current urgent demands of the masses - counter-liquidation - which led to immature ideological preparation. Some sufferings had not been fully voiced. Although the land had been distributed, the awareness of the masses had not been raised. Some started from organizing farmers' associations, but because the masses did not understand the farmers' associations, the farmers' associations did not play a role. In addition, there was still a lack of clear understanding of the issue of boldly letting go of the mass line, and there were some undemocratic phenomena. After research, it was made clear that the future direction should be to start with counter-liquidation and anti-compiled village, with the slogans "Revenge for grudges, redress grievances, speak out your suffering, vent your anger" and "Settle old scores with the ringleaders of counter-liquidation, the 'oil workshops'." From this, guide them to the principle of "the tillers should own their land," oppose simple methods, undemocratic practices, and substituting for the masses, and call on them to study policies in depth and let the masses implement the policies.

　　放手放给群众  纠正包办分地
  　曲沃新区群运获新进展
    【本报太岳五日电】曲沃检查麦收前的土地改革运动，纠正单纯分配土地现象，从群众迫切要求出发，启发群众觉悟。在曲沃城解放后，因为破城参战等任务紧急，直至五月底全县才进入土地改革。县上集中了本地外来干部一百三十余人，于五月十七日分赴各区召开积极分子会议，宣传时事打通了“变天思想”，许多地区都进行了诉苦，许多人痛哭流涕，在讨论“敢不敢翻身”时，有的说：“八路军这回可不远了，直到黄河边都是咱的人，还怕甚？”有的说“这回把小蒋介石（指土顽）都服住了，‘油坊’（指蒋阎编村干部）打翻，咱就敢干”。有的说：“去年咱只翻了半个身，‘油坊’就打了咱，今年可要早下手。”，大家情绪很高，多数村都订出了斗争计划，从找苦根上提出对象到处激扬着“八路军打天下，老百姓坐江山”，“团结力量大”“有苦诉苦，有冤报怨”“灭封建收土地”等口号。到月底一礼拜时间，即有十一个行政村突破。至六月一号全县即转入收麦，但在麦收中，运动也未停止，许多村都在一面酝酿，一面收麦。县上又趁此时召开各基点组长联席会议，会上发现不少村庄对入手问题未弄好，有些机械的强调了耕者有其田，在运动指导上单纯解决土地观点，草率的将地主奸霸的土地拿过来分配就算，忽视了当前群众迫切的要求——反倒算，而致思想酝酿不成熟，有些苦未诉透，虽然分了地，但群众觉悟仍未提高。有些是从组织农会入手，因为群众还不了解农会，致农会不起作用，另外还有对群众路线大胆放手问题还了解不清楚，并有些不够民主现象。经研究后，明确指出今后方针要从反倒算反编村入手，口号是“有仇报仇，有冤报冤，有苦诉苦，有气出气。”和“倒算祸首‘油房’算老帐。”由此再引导到耕者有其田，反对简单方式、不民主、代替群众的现象，并号召深入学习政策，把政策交给群众去执行。
