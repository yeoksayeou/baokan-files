　　Soviet Construction Briefs
    ★ One of the largest hydroelectric stations in the Soviet Union is under construction on the Kama River, a tributary of the Volga River. This hydroelectric station project is being built under the guidance of Alexanderov, a leading Soviet expert, using new equipment. It is scheduled to supply power to the Urals starting in 1950.
    ★ The Soviet food industry is rapidly increasing production. This spring, it exceeded the plan by 3 percent, and this summer, it exceeded the plan by 9 percent. The production of sugar, bread, salt, cheese, vegetable oil, and canned food has greatly increased. Bread production has returned to pre-war levels, but the establishment of new large flour mills will continue to increase its output.
    ★ Soviet youth are actively participating in the restoration work in the Donets Basin. The number of young miners has increased annually. By 1950, 240,000 miners will graduate from labor preparation schools and participate in mine association work.
    ★ The Soviet Union is building houses on a large scale. One million square meters of housing for railway workers is under construction. This year, 175,000 houses will be built in rural Ukraine, with 85,000 currently under construction. Of the 590,000 houses destroyed by the German invaders in Ukraine during the war, 530,000 have now been restored. Workers and engineers residing in Siberia, the Urals, and the Far East will be able to purchase 50,000 small houses from the government at low prices this year.
    ★ The Soviet automobile industry has produced many new types of cars this year. New diesel-powered buses are now appearing on the streets of Moscow. In addition, newly designed cars include electric cars and steam cars.
