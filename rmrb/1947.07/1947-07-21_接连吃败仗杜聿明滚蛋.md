Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Du Yuming, the Kuomintang's Northeast Security Commander, frequently touted by Nationalist propaganda outlets as a so-called "general who dominates the battlefield," has been dismissed by Chiang Kai-shek on the 17th due to repeated defeats. The official reason given was that he was "permitted to go to the United States for medical treatment," and "his position as commander will be temporarily held by Deputy Commander Zheng Dongguo" (Central News Agency). After the Democratic Allied Forces voluntarily withdrew from Siping and Changchun last year, Du Yuming once boasted, "The National Army can occupy Harbin whenever it pleases." He also proudly declared that General Lin Biao, commander of the Democratic Allied Forces, was no match for him. Unexpectedly, today, because he suffered defeats in battles with General Lin Biao, Chiang Kai-shek ruthlessly kicked him aside. According to various sources, Du Yuming's illness is a "political illness." Another reason for his being kicked off to foreign lands for "medical treatment" is that there are contradictions between Chen Cheng and the Whampoa clique (Note: Du was a first-term student of Whampoa). Du's being "permitted" to go abroad occurred after Chen Cheng arrived in Shenyang to hold a military conference. Secondly, Du Yuming and "Sun Liren, the commander of the New First Army, originally equipped and trained by the United States," "are not harmonious" (Associated Press). Before flying to Shenyang, Chen Cheng first summoned Sun Liren in Nanjing to discuss a plan to squeeze out Du Yuming and give Sun control of actual power.

### 接连吃败仗杜聿明滚蛋

　　接连吃败仗杜聿明滚蛋
    【新华社陕北十九日电】国民党宣传机关经常吹嘘的所谓“叱咤风云的将领”蒋记东北保安司令长官杜聿明，近因屡战屡败，已于十七日被蒋介石电令滚蛋，名义是“准许赴美疗疾”。“其长官职务由副长官郑洞国代理”（中央社）。去年民主联军自动撤出四平、长春之后，杜聿明曾大言炎炎：“国军高兴什么时候进占哈尔滨，什么时候就可以进去。”并骄傲地宣称，民主联军总司令林彪将军非彼敌手。不料今日就因在与林彪将军交锋中吃了败仗，蒋介石便冷酷无情地把他一脚踢开。据各方消息：杜聿明的病是“政治病”，他的被踢出洋“疗疾”的另外原因，一是陈诚与黄埔系（按：杜为黄埔一期学生）的矛盾，杜之被“允准”出洋，系在陈诚抵沈召开军事会议之后；二是杜聿明与“原任美国装备与训练的新一军军长孙立人”“不和睦”（合众社）。陈诚在飞沈前，曾先在南京召见孙立人，商定排挤杜聿明，由孙掌握实权之计。
