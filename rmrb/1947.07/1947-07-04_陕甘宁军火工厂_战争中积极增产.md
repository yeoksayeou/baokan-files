Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 1st. The entire staff of a military factory in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region persisted in production during the Self-Defense War and formed a guerrilla team to guard the factory while working. Two weeks ago, when the enemy forces were "mopping up," the entire staff of the factory transferred the entire factory in one morning and continued to work in the new area in the afternoon. Under the conditions of lacking equipment and streamlined manpower, the factory's production still maintained the pre-war level. Employee Zhang Zongming has increased production by more than 30 percent. Under the slogan of ensuring that the army does not lack clothing, workers at a clothing factory in the border region have been working continuously for 26 days and nights, completing the task of sewing 40,000 sets of military uniforms and making 40,000 hats in five days. Workers Wu Jinxi and Hong Yun, and others, tailored 200 sets in one day, reaching the highest record. Furthermore, workers in various clothing and shoe factories have voluntarily stopped receiving wages since March under the conscious demand of "saving wages to support the front line in winning battles."

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 2nd. In the "Three Alls Policy" of the Chiang Kai-shek-Hu Zongnan bandit troops' "mopping up," farmers in various villages in the Fengfu District of Yan'an County persisted in production. Every morning, the militiamen kept a close watch near the enemy bunkers and on the road from Yan'an to Panlong, so that the farmers could sow seeds in the ground on the mountains only three or four miles away from the enemy strongholds. Now, the vast Fengfu District's Millyard River has been mostly planted, and all the mountains, rivers, and water lands are covered with lush green crops.

　　陕甘宁军火工厂
  　战争中积极增产
    【新华社西北一日电】陕甘宁边区某军火工厂全体职工在自卫战争中坚持生产，并组成游击队，一面警戒，一面工作。两周前当敌军清剿时，该厂全体职工一上午即将工厂全部转移，下午又在新地区继续开工。在缺乏设备精简人力的条件下，该厂生产仍保持战前水平。职员张宗明已增产百分之三十以上。边区某被服厂在保证军队不缺穿的口号下，目前工友们曾连续工作二十六昼夜，完成了缝制军衣四万套，五天做好帽子四万顶的任务。工友武进邸、洪云等三人，在一天之内裁剪了二百套，达到最高纪录。又各被服制鞋工厂工友，在“把工资节省下来支援前线打胜仗”的自觉要求下，已自三月份起自动停领工资。
    【新华社西北二日电】在蒋胡匪军“三光政策”的清剿中，延安县丰富区各村农民坚持生产，每天清早民兵就在敌碉堡附近及由延安到蟠龙的大道上严密警戒，使农民们能在离敌据点仅三、四里的山头上揭地下种。现广大的丰富区米粮川已大部种完，所有山川水地都长着绿油油的庄稼。
