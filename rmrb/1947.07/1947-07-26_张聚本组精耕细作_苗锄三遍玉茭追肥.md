　　【This dispatch from Ping Shun】Under the promotion of Political Director Yang Qilai, the Zhang Juben group in Dashitou River Village, District Seven, held discussions, and everyone set a plan to weed the seedlings three times. They generally aimed to weed the millet and corn three times, and the miscellaneous fields twice. The entire group cultivated a total of 113 mu of autumn land, including 40 mu of millet, 53 mu of corn, 10 mu of vines, and 10 mu of miscellaneous fields. Currently, there are 8 mu of millet and corn that have not been weeded for the second time. The group has nine full laborers and three semi-laborers. They completed the second weeding on the 15th of this month. On the 16th, they launched a surprise planting of 4 mu of late crops (radishes, vegetables, etc.), completing it in one day. From the 17th to the 31st, over a period of 15 days, they will complete the third weeding and universally apply top dressing to the cornfields. Due to the lack of fertilizer for weeding the miscellaneous fields, in addition to the existing night soil and manure from their own homes, the entire group discussed assigning one laborer to transport goods from outside to earn foreign currency to buy fourteen catties of kerosene to supplement the fertilizer shortage.

　　张聚本组精耕细作
  　苗锄三遍玉茭追肥
    【本报平顺讯】七区大石头河村张聚本组在政治主任杨起来推动下，全组纷纷讨论，大家订出了三遍锄苗计划。谷、玉茭普遍争取上三遍锄，杂田两遍，全组共秋地一百一十三亩，谷子四十亩，玉茭五十三亩，地蔓十亩，杂田十亩。现未锄二遍的谷、玉茭八亩，全组全劳力九个，半劳力三个，于本月十五号完成锄二遍。十六号突击种晚田四亩（萝卜菜等），一天完成。自十七号起到卅一号十五天的时间完成三遍锄苗并结合玉茭地普遍上追肥。锄杂田由于肥料缺乏除自己家现有圊肥、圈肥外，全组讨论抽出一个劳力专到外力搞运输赚洋买柏油十四斤来补助肥料的不足。
