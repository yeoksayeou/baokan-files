　　【Benbao JiaoZuo News】In the southern enemy rear area of JiaoZuo City, poor and hired peasants have been trained in recent months, igniting the flames of revenge. The counter-reversal movement is being vigorously carried out. In late March, the southern JiaoZuo guerrilla group, in coordination with the sub-district troops and the WuZhi armed forces, launched an offensive, boldly mobilizing the masses for guerrilla warfare, and fiercely crushing the restoration of Chiang Kai-shek, landlords, and despots. After more than a month of fighting, they gained a foothold and created an enemy rear guerrilla base area, more than ten miles from north to south and more than twenty miles from east to west, covering an area of approximately two hundred square miles, with twenty-two administrative villages and thirty-eight natural villages.

　　On May 20, the district held a training class for poor peasants, hired laborers, and activists on the spot. More than forty people participated in telling their sufferings, igniting the flames of revenge, and demanding "old scores and new scores be settled together" and "a total reckoning of thousands of years of blood debts." The leadership proposed: "The district does not leave the district, the village does not leave the village, one hand holds a gun, the other hand distributes land." On the 23rd, all district cadres went to the villages with the activists. On the 24th, a total of forty-three feudal restorationist landlords and gunmen were arrested in various villages. From the 25th to the 27th, a general revenge meeting was held, and twelve masterminds of the reversal, including the special agent and gunman Ma Qingyang, were suppressed. On the 26th, the counter-reversal began, including returning land, returning grain, collecting wheat, returning houses, returning livestock, and returning land, houses, and property that had been previously returned to the masses. Since then, the feudal despotic landlord class has lowered its head, and the peasants have raised their heads, demanding to eradicate the roots and settle all old and new scores together. Landlords in the enemy-occupied areas also began to contact the democratic government. A landlord in Dianhou said: "I don't want my home anymore, let the small households collect the wheat!" The chief of the Xiwuchu Baojia and head of the self-defense corps said to his subordinates: "If you want to rob the small households of wheat, you should re-elect the officers! We can't do it." The landlord of the Cao family in Zaodian reported that the small households were harvesting wheat and sent cloth to pay public grain. The landlord Wang Qiheng of Xindian had just returned from a meeting in Mudian, preparing to have the security team seize the wheat, but dared not do it when he encountered the peasants' revenge. The eighteen despotic landlords of Fucheng kowtowed to the masses and made a pledge to return the land to the masses. The villages have completely changed. Seven villages, including Nanzhang, have returned all the fruits of the struggle. The peasants have united and organized themselves, taking guns in teams to harvest their labor fruits near the strongholds. According to statistics from three villages in just three days, 145 mu of wheat ears were harvested. Currently, this movement is still continuing to develop. (Han Min, Lian Qun)

　　【Benbao BoAi News】 Counter-reversal is being vigorously carried out in the border areas of BoAi. Cadres are steadfastly persisting on the spot, thoroughly crushing the Baojia system, and resolutely suppressing the masterminds of the reversal. Last winter, special agents, despots, and returning landlords who came with the Chiang Kai-shek army brutally murdered activists, reversed grain and land, and beat and scolded the masses. As a result, the masses were frightened. At the beginning of the counter-reversal, the masses dared not move because the cadres had not settled down. Later, the leadership decided to persist on the spot, and the cadres were specifically assigned to go deep into the masses to mobilize them to tell their sufferings, crush the Baojia system, restore the democratic government, and order the landlords and despots to return the fruits to the masses. The reversal masterminds Guo Zhenxue and Guo Fengyi in Liucun not only refused to return, but also set up a scam. The despots ate the wheat that the masses were supposedly getting. They held a big meeting to ask the masses to protect them, saying "When the Eighth Route Army asks, just say the fruits have been returned, and the land deeds have also been issued." The poor peasants were furious but dared not say a word. Later, the masses secretly reported to Zhang Maotian, a cadre returning to the village. The district immediately combined the troops and on a certain night went to Liucun to capture the reversal masterminds Guo Zhenxue, the returning members of the security team Fengyi, and seven others. Subsequently, Guo Zhenxue, Wang Wenjun and three others, who had committed heinous crimes, were executed. Only then did the despotic landlords become alarmed and took the initiative to return the fruits to the masses. In less than three days, the masses were eating wheat. In Beishijian Village, at the beginning, the masses dared not take the wheat from the despots. Only after the cadres settled down did they slowly dare to tell their sufferings and tell the truth. After two meetings, the masses dared to go to the despots' fields to carry wheat. In two nights, they divided more than one hundred mu of wheat from eight despots. From then on, the masses saw their own strength and gradually dared to go to the despots' homes to lead back the mules they had been allocated, take back the clothes that had been reversed, and accuse several murderers and reversal leaders. Now the self-defense team has been organized to stand guard and prepare for revenge. (Hou Jianzhong)

　　退粮退地严惩倒算祸首
  　焦作敌后农民稳坐天下
    【本报焦作讯】焦作市南敌后游击区近月训练贫雇，点起复仇怒火，反倒算运动正在猛烈开展。三月下旬，市南游击集团配合分区部队及武陟武装发动攻势，大胆放手发动群众游击战争，猛摧蒋贼、地主、恶霸的统治复辟，辗战月余，站稳了脚跟，创造了敌后游击根据地，南北十余里，东西二十多里，面积约二百余平方里，有二十二个行政村，三十八个自然村。
    五月二十日区里就地召开贫雇、积极分子训练班，有四十余人参加诉苦，点起了复仇的怒火，要求“新仇旧仇一齐报”，“千年血债一盘总清算”。领导上提出：“区不离区，村不离村，一手拿枪，一手分田”。二十三日全区干部分头跟着积极分子回到各村去。二十四日各村逮捕封建复辟倒算地主、黑枪手共计四十三个。二十五到二十七三天普遍开复仇大会，镇压了倒算头子、特务黑枪手的主谋分子马清洋等十二人。二十六日即开始反倒算进行总清算，退地、退粮、收麦、退房、退牲口及过去清算赔还群众的土地房屋财产。自此封建恶霸地主阶级低了头，农民们抬起头来，要求斩草除根，新仇旧仇一齐报。敌占据点内的地主也开始找民主政府接头。店后一个地主说：“我的家不要了，麦子小户收就去收吧！”西五褚保长自卫团长对他的部下说：你们若要抢小户的麦子，你们重选办事员吧！我们不能干了，”造店曹家地主告小户收麦并送布交公粮。新店地主王启恒刚从木店开会回来，准备叫保安队抢麦子，遇到农民的复仇不敢干了。府城十八恶霸地主向群众叩头具结退地给群众。各村完全变了样，退出全部斗争果实的村庄已有南张等七个村，农民们串通组织起来，一队一队的带着枪到据点附近收割自己的劳动果实，仅三天三个村的统计，就收割了一百四十五亩的麦穗。目前这一运动仍在继续发展中。（汉民、联群）
    【本报博爱讯】博爱边地猛烈展开反倒算，干部就地坚持，彻底摧垮保甲制度，坚决镇压倒算祸首。去冬随蒋军过来的特务恶霸还乡地主，残杀积极分子，倒粮、倒地、打骂群众。因此群众害了怕。开始反倒算时，由于干部没有住下，群众便不敢动。后来领导上决心就地坚持，干部具体分工，深入群众发动诉苦。摧垮保甲制度，恢复民主政权，命令地主恶霸给群众退果实。六村倒算祸首郭振雪、郭凤义等不但不退、还设了一套骗局，恶霸们吃麦子群众应名，还开大会叫群众包庇好，“八路军要问时就说果实倒回去了，地契也出了。”贫苦农民气破了肚子也不敢吭气，后经群众暗地告给回村干部张茂田，区上当即结合部队于某日晚到六村捕捉倒算祸首郭振雪，还乡团凤义等七人，随即处决了罪大恶极的郭振雪、王文均等三名，恶霸地主们这才着了慌，纷纷自动找群众退果实。不到三日群众就吃到麦子，北石涧村在开始，群众不敢要恶霸们的麦子，干部住下后，才慢慢敢诉苦说真心话。经过两次会议，群众便敢去恶霸地里背麦子了，两夜便分了八户恶霸的一百余亩麦子。从此群众看到了自己的力量，渐渐的也敢去恶霸家里牵回分得的骡子，拿回被倒算的衣服，诉出了几个杀人凶手倒算头子，现自卫队已组织起来，站岗放哨，准备报仇。　　　　　　　　　　（侯建中）
