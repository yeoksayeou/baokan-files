　　Tetanus's Enemy—Carbolic Acid
    Chong Ren
    Tetanus is a dangerous disease. From April to June, tetanus deaths accounted for three-fifths of all deaths in the Second Branch of the Fifth District Hospital. It can occur not only from injuries but also from very small scrapes and cuts. On June 2nd, Jiao Wutang, our cook, cut a small wound on the second thumb (index finger) of his left hand while cutting vegetables. The next day, he had a fever, felt weak, had a headache and nasal congestion (but was still able to work). He collapsed after lunch on the third day. His face showed a bitter smile, his jaw was tight, his neck was stiff, his pulse was extremely fast, urination was difficult, and he was sweating profusely. The diagnosis was acute tetanus. He was immediately isolated. A gauze strip soaked in pure carbolic acid was applied to the wound. Three cc of a 15% carbolic acid solution were injected intravenously. Some mild laxatives, sedatives, and cardiac tonics were taken internally. The same amount of injection was given again before night. (The patient felt dizzy and feverish all over during the injection.) The injection dosage remained the same on the third day, three times a day. One cc of morphine was also injected into each masseter muscle. The patient did not show any major changes. On the fourth day, the patient felt that his toothache was relieved a little. He was injected again as before and given an enema once. On the fifth day, his mouth and teeth had opened, and his tongue coating was white and thick. For the next four days, injections were given as before. He was given another mild laxative and an enema, and now he is completely recovered. It took a total of nine days. This is mainly due to the killing power of carbolic acid against tetanus bacteria.

　　破伤风之敌—石炭酸
    崇仁
    破伤风是一种危险的病症。五分区医院二所四月到六月之中，破伤风的死亡占全死亡的五分之三。它不仅是负了伤，就是很小的擦破割破也会发生。六月二日我们所上炊事员焦五堂切菜把左手上二姆指（食指）切了个小伤口，第二日便全身发烧无力、头疼鼻塞，（仍能工作）第三日午饭后便躺到了。面现苦笑，牙关紧痛，颈部强直，脉跳极速，小便不利，汗流不止。诊断结果是急性破伤风。当即把他隔离开。伤部上纯石炭酸液纱条。静脉内注射百分之一十五的石炭酸液三西西。内服了些缓下镇静强心药。夜晚前又用同量注射液注一次。（注射时患者曾感头晕全身发热）第三日注射量仍同前。一日三次。并在两侧咬肌上各注射吗啡一西西，患者无大变化。第四日患者便觉牙痛轻松了些。又照前法注射，灌肠一次。第五日嘴牙已张开了，舌苔白而厚。以后四天注射照前。又服缓下药一次，灌肠一次，现已完全好了。前后共经过了九天。这主要是石炭酸对破伤风菌捕灭的力量。
