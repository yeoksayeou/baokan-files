　　Wangjiayuan Mutual Aid Brigade
    An Zhaiyue
    Wangjiayuan is an administrative village three miles south of Qinshui city. During the Anti-Japanese War, in order to more effectively besiege the enemy in the city and save the masses, labor mutual aid was established under the leadership of Wang Shuihou, chairman of the joint association. Three emergency plantings were carried out in 1942 and 1943. Due to their tight organization, the enemy's five encirclements and attacks were unsuccessful. In the midst of intense struggle, they also collectively reclaimed 146 mu of wasteland and provided 780 labor days to other villages, enabling 63 peasant households in the village to survive starvation and death. This mutual aid, established in the struggle against the enemy, has a very solid foundation. All 47 male full laborers in the village have never withdrawn from mutual aid to this day. Currently, 93 percent of all male and female full and semi-laborers in the village are in mutual aid groups. After years of collective labor training, the labor efficiency of the entire brigade has significantly improved. This spring, collective firewood carrying was two bundles per person per day for one work point, equivalent to two work points at ordinary times; manure delivery was three work points equivalent to four work points; weeding was generally three work points equivalent to four work points; and the Zhao Baolin group of 11 people weeded nine mu of rice seedlings in one day, averaging two work points equivalent to three work points. As a result, from the first month to the present, the entire brigade has saved a total of 1,784 work points. And it has truly achieved 50 dan of manure per mu of land, plowing three times, while also opening up 34 mu of new wasteland. Also, due to the increase in labor efficiency, it is easier to organize surplus labor for sideline production. From last winter to the present, the masses in the entire village have earned 359,060 yuan.
    How can 93 percent of the labor force in the entire village be organized? The main reasons and experiences are: (1) The masses have suffered long-term war devastation, and after the land reform movement, landless and land-poor peasants have obtained land and urgently demand to develop production and restore vitality; (2) The masses have personally experienced the great strength of organization over the years, especially in the struggle to besiege Qinshui city, relying on organization to overcome disasters and drive away the enemy; (3) Truly realized voluntary association, and participation in mutual aid groups is free to join and leave. If there is something to do, you can leave the group at any time to do household chores, and you can do odd jobs alone for a few days; (4) Give play to their expertise, and cooperate according to different labor techniques, such as the four carpenters, two masons, two businessmen, two livestock workers, and one weaver in the village. They organized "worker mutual aid groups" and established "cooperatives" and "textile learning centers," exchanging labor with those who farm, and both parties are satisfied; (5) Cadres take the lead and go deep into the masses to lead labor. Cadres are not special, they obey the leadership of the group leader in the group, abide by labor discipline, they are model workers and labor heroes; (6) In the use and organization of labor, there are scientific methods. In addition to the three detachments of male mutual aid groups with 47 people, there are also worker mutual aid groups with six people, women's weaving groups with 27 people, and children's mutual aid groups with nine people. The brigade leader, instructor, and detachment leaders, as well as some mutual aid group leaders, form a brigade headquarters. All tasks are jointly studied and uniformly arranged and equipped through production work. Work is done according to seasonal labor, labor strength, and technical level, with flexible centralized and decentralized use, and organizational forms are changed at any time: for example, in the spring plowing preparation work, firewood chopping is generally carried out in units of detachments. Manure delivery is done in units of groups, and larger tasks such as repairing dikes and building embankments are carried out by the entire brigade. In spring plowing, free combination is used to "do what is in the heart," such as mutual aid groups centered on cattle, and old men and women can also voluntarily participate, with appropriate allocation, and mobile groups are organized to prepare for temporary participation in combat and odd jobs. When weeding, the detachment is generally used as the unit for adjustment, and the detachment is appropriately allocated according to the specific situation, such as the order of planting, the size of the seedlings, the size of the grass, the mountains and plains, and the size of the plots, and then everyone discusses and distributes fairly. In the autumn harvest, the detachment is still used as the unit of activity, and each place is quickly harvested. Various mutual aid groups with different characteristics are also transferred according to agricultural production. For example, women's mutual aid groups are mainly engaged in weaving, children are mainly engaged in school, and workers are mainly engaged in outside work. During the farming season, women weave for half a day and go to the fields for half a day; children study for half a day and produce for half a day. In case of emergency planting and harvesting, all are mobilized. The combination of agriculture and sideline occupations is divided into three forms: First, after accurate planning throughout the year, the remaining labor force is drawn out and allocated according to their skills and abilities to regular sideline and handicraft production. For example, carpenters and weavers can go out to produce, and the brigade shares the profits, and the brigade gives them land to cultivate, which is beneficial to both parties; second, seasonal sideline production is selected during spring plowing and weeding, and autumn harvest, and the remaining labor force is drawn out to do it, such as cutting wheat in the border areas and digging medicinal materials in the mountains; third, the entire brigade concentrates on sideline production during agricultural gaps.

　　王家园互助大队
    安寨月
    王家园是沁源城南三里一个行政村。抗日战争中为更有力的围困城内敌人，救活群众，在联合会主席王水厚的领导下，建立了劳动互助。四二、四三年中进行了三次抢种。由于他们组织的严密，敌人虽五次包围与袭击，都扑了空。在紧张的斗争中，他们还集体开荒一百四十六亩，给别村打忙工七百八十个，使村中六十三户农民从饥饿死亡中活过来。这个在对敌斗争中建立起来的互助，基础是十分牢固的。全村男全劳力四十七人，一直到现在没有一个退出互助的，现全村男女全半劳力百分之九十三在互助组。经数年集体劳动锻炼，全大队的劳动效率显著提高。今春集体担柴，每人每天两担一工，可抵平时二工，送粪三工抵四工，锄苗普遍三工抵四工，而赵保林小组十一人一天拔谷苗达九亩，平均二工抵三工。因而从正月至现在，全大队共节省一千七百八十四个工。并且真正做到每亩地上粪五十担、犁三遍，同时增开新荒三十四亩。又由于劳动效率的提高，便于组织余工进行副业生产，从去冬到现在，全村群众获利三十五万九千零六十元。
    全村百分之九十三的劳力如何能组织起来呢？其主要原因与经验是：（一）群众经过长期的战争摧残，又经过土地改革运动，无地少地的农民获得了土地，迫切要求生产发家、恢复元气；（二）群众从数年中亲身体验到组织起来力量大，尤其在围困沁源城斗争中依靠组织起来，渡过了灾荒，困走了敌人；（三）真正的实现了自愿结合，参加互助组可以自由出入。有事随时可以离组去做家庭事，零活可以自己单独做几天；（四）发挥了一技之长，按不同劳动技术分工合作，如全村有四个木匠、两个泥工、两个经商者、两个畜牧工人和一个织布工人，他们组织了“工人互助组”，建立了“合作社”，“纺织学习所”，与种地的人变工合作，双方都满意；（五）干部带头，深入群众领导劳动。干部不特殊，在组内服从组长领导，遵守劳动纪律，他们是模范工作者，又是劳动英雄；（六）在劳动的使用与组织上，各有科学的方法，除男互助组三个分队四十七人外，另外有工人互助组六人，妇女纺织组廿七人，儿童互助组九人。大队长、指导员与各分队长及部分互助组组长，组成一个大队部，各项工作通过生产工作，共同研究统一安排、统一配备力量。做活是按季节活计劳力强弱、技术高低，灵活的集中与分散使用，随时变更组织形式：如春耕准备工作中，打柴一般以分队为单位活动。送粪时以小组为单位，修堤垒堰等较大的活，则是全大队集中出动。春耕中又以“对心事”自由结合，如以牛为中心的互助小组，老汉、妇女也可自愿参加、适当配备，并组织机动小组准备临时参战及做零活等。锄苗时一般以分队为调剂单位，分队并根据具体情况适当分配，如种的先后、苗子大小、草大草小、山地平地、地块大小，然后大家讨论公道分配。秋收中，仍以分队为活动单位，每至一地迅速割完，各种不同性质的互助组，也是根据农业生产而转移。如妇女互助组，青年以纺织为主，儿童以上学为主，工人以出外揽工为主，农时妇女纺织半天，上地半天；儿童学习半天、生产半天，如紧急抢种抢收时，则全体总动员。而农业与副业的结合，又分为三种形式：第一、经过全年精确计划，将全年剩余劳力抽出根据其技术与能力分配其经常性的副业与手工业生产，如木工、织布工人等可以出去生产，与大队分红，大队给其种地，两方都有利；第二、在春耕锄苗、秋收中，选择有季节性的副业生产，抽出剩余劳力去做，如到边沿区割麦与上山挖药材；第三、农业空隙中，全大队集中做副业生产。
