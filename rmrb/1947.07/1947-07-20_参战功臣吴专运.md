    War Effort Hero Wu Zhuanyun
    Wu Zhuanyun, a peasant who had turned over a new leaf, was the director of the peasant association in Nanyao Village, Sixth District, Jiyuan. In early May, when the higher authorities called on the Jiyuan civilian laborers to participate in the war effort in southern Shanxi, he insisted on going despite his illness. The leaders said, "You're sick, don't go this time!" But he insisted on going. He was finally allowed to go, leading three stretchers and five militiamen, excitedly heading to participate in the war.
    During the war effort, whenever they reached a rest stop, he would first fetch water and chop firewood, give the best food to everyone else, take the lead in doing things, and let others sleep. If there was no space, he would sleep in the courtyard. When the civilian laborers' shoes were broken, he mended four pairs of shoes for everyone one morning. The civilian laborers in the squad often said happily, "Our squad leader is so good, taking care of us in every way, making us feel like we haven't suffered at all, it's just like being at home!"
    When our army captured Xiangning City, Wu Zhuanyun's civilian laborer squad accepted the glorious task of carrying the wounded. Wu Zhuanyun cared for the wounded along the way as if they were his own brothers. At night, he slept beside the wounded in his clothes, attending to them carefully. Sometimes the wounded would ask confusedly, "Are you the instructor?" "Comrade, no, I'm a civilian laborer," Zhuanyun replied kindly. "I don't believe it, you must be the instructor," the wounded man murmured. After arriving at the hospital, he settled the wounded properly and said with concern, "Comrade, I have to go, take good care of your injuries!" The wounded man said very gratefully, "You treat me even better than my parents, what can I do to thank you when you leave?" "Comrade, isn't it for us that you shed blood? Isn't it right for us to take care of you like this?" In mutual reluctance, Wu Zhuanyun led the civilian laborers away.
    Wu Zhuanyun's model of caring for the wounded quickly spread among the Jiyuan civilian laborers. Everyone said in unison, "Wu Zhuanyun is really good, we must learn from him." When the war effort period ended, Wu Zhuanyun was selected as a special-class war effort hero by the civilian laborers of the Sixth District of Jiyuan. After returning home, the people of his hometown warmly congratulated him.

    参战功臣吴专运
    翻身农民吴专运，是济源六区南尧村的农会主任。五月初，上级号召济源民夫到晋南参战，他带病的要求着要去。领导上说：“你病着，这次不去吧！”但他要求非去不成。终于得到允许，带领着三付担架，五个民兵，兴奋地前往参战。
    参战过程中，每到休息地，他就首先去担水劈柴，吃饭尽大家，做事跑头里，睡觉让别人，没有地方，自己就睡在院里，民夫的鞋破了，他一早晨给大家钉了四双鞋。班内的民夫，经常欢欣地说着：“我们的班长真好，处处照顾我们，使我们连一点罪也没受，在家也不过如此！”
    我军攻下乡宁城，吴专运民夫班，接受了抬伤员的光荣任务。吴专运沿途爱护伤员好象自己的亲兄弟一样。夜晚，他自己和衣卧在伤员旁边，小心地侍候着，有时那伤员迷糊地问着：“你是指导员？”“同志，不是，是民夫”，专运亲切地答着。“我不信，你一定是指导员”。伤员喃喃地说着。送到医院后，他把伤员安置妥当就关心地说：“同志，我要走了，你好好地养伤吧！”那伤员非常感激地说：“你比我父母待我还好，你走喽，叫我怎样感谢你呀？”“同志，你流血还不是为着我们，我们对你这点照护，还不应该？”在互相留恋中，吴专运领着民夫走开了。
    吴专运爱护伤员的模范，在济源民夫中很快地传播着。大家异口同声地说：“吴专运真是好，咱们也要学习他。”参战期满，吴专运被济源六区民夫选为特等参战功臣。返里后，家乡人民热烈地向他贺功。
