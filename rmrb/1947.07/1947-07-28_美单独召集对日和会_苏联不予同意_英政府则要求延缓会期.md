　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. The U.S. government issued invitations on July 16th, inviting eleven countries including the UK, USSR, France, China, Canada, the Philippines, India, Australia, the Netherlands, and New Zealand to participate in a Japanese peace conference unilaterally decided by the U.S. to be held in the U.S. on August 19th. According to Moscow on the 24th: U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, visited Molotov on July 11th and delivered a memorandum; Smith discussed with Molotov the U.S. decision to convene the Japanese peace conference on August 19th. The Soviet government delivered a formal reply to Smith on the 22nd to be forwarded to the U.S. government; the reply stated: "As is well known, the U.S., Soviet Union, China, and the UK jointly defeated the Japanese aggressors with their military force. During the war against Japan, clear agreements were reached between the four countries on the two issues of combat and the post-war peace treaty, which were clearly stipulated in the Cairo Conference, the Yalta Conference, and the Potsdam Conference. According to the terms of the Moscow Conference agreement in December 1945, the resolutions passed by the Allied Council for Japan and the Washington Far Eastern Commission, in which the above four countries participated, must obtain the unanimous consent of the representatives of the above four countries to guarantee the special interests of the four powers in the post-war issues of Japan. In view of the above, the Soviet government cannot agree to the United States' unilateral decision to convene a meeting to draft a Japanese peace treaty without prior consultation with the governments of the Soviet Union, China, and the UK. The Soviet government believes that the issue of convening a meeting to draft a Japanese peace treaty must first be considered by the four-power foreign ministers' conference."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. London dispatch: After receiving the U.S. invitation to convene a Japanese peace conference on the 16th, the British government expressed "welcome" to the U.S. proposal to convene a Japanese peace treaty as soon as possible, but requested a postponement of the meeting. This is because Britain has agreed to participate in the British Empire Conference to be held in Canberra on August 26th, in order to initially exchange views on the Japanese peace treaty with the British dominions.

　　美单独召集对日和会
  　苏联不予同意
  　英政府则要求延缓会期
    【新华社陕北廿五日电】美国政府于七月十六日发出请柬，邀请英、苏、法、中、加、菲、印、澳、荷与纽西兰等十一国参加由美单独决定于八月十九日在美举行的对日和会。据莫斯科廿四日讯：美国驻苏大使史密斯曾于七月十一日访莫洛托夫并递交备忘录一件；史氏就美国定八月十九日召集对日和会事，与莫洛托夫商谈。苏联政府于廿二日将正式复文交史密斯转美国政府；该复文称：“如众所周知，美、苏、中、英四国以其武力共同战胜日本侵略者。在对日作战时，关于作战及战后订立和约的两个问题，四国间已获明确协议，在开罗会议、雅尔达会议、波茨顿会议上，对此已有明文规定。依照一九四五年十二月莫斯科会议的协定的条款，由上述四国参加盟国对日委员会，华盛顿远东委员会所通过之决议，须得上述四国代表的一致同意，保证四强对日本战后各问题上之特殊利益。鉴于上述情况，苏联政府不能同意美国事前未与苏、中、英政府磋商而片面决定召开草拟对日和会的建议。苏联政府认为：召开草拟对日和约会议的问题，必须先经四强外长会议考虑。”
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】伦敦讯：英政府于十六日接获美国召开对日和会之请柬后，对美国尽速召集对日和约的建议表示“欢迎”，但要求延缓会期。盖英国已答应参加八月二十六日在坎培拉举行的大英帝国会议，以便与英国自治领初步交换对日和约的意见。
