Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 3rd: As soon as the wheat harvest was over, the liberated peasants in various places eagerly paid the counter-offensive grain, and many places exceeded the planned task. The masses in the Fourth District of Xiuwu, comparing the hunger and pain under the rule of Chiang Kai-shek's puppet regime with the happiness and joy after liberation, said, "Let's defeat Chiang Kai-shek quickly, and our lives will be better." The district's public grain was paid in full within two days, exceeding the original quota by more than 20,000 jin. The masses in Lin County automatically proposed paying public grain as one of the contents of the meritorious service campaign. The masses in the border area of ​​Wuzhi put forward the standard that public grain must be "completely clean and three times (full grains)", and all the peasants were mobilized to concentrate on the central area overnight. The peasants in six villages, including the Wuan Mine, contributed more than 20,000 jin of public grain. Government personnel used a lot of effort to persuade the original households to take back the excess amount to save for famine.

Taiyue, 3rd: The military and civilians of the two counties of Yuanqu and Wangwu, who had successfully completed the wheat harvest and rush planting through extremely fierce struggles, launched a fierce struggle to protect grain and recruits. After the failure of the stubborn puppets in Yuanqu to sabotage the wheat harvest plan, they recently attempted to concentrate their forces to rob grain and capture recruits in our border areas. The headquarters of Yuanqu and Wangwu counties have long seen through the enemy's cunning tricks, and after the wheat harvest, they thoroughly implemented the emptying of houses and fields, leaving only one or two dou of grain per household. In Canshi and Xishi villages in the First District of Yuanqu, a grain storage contract was also strictly stipulated. The militia in various districts also widely attacked the enemy under the call to protect grain and recruits. The militia moved to the vicinity of the Chengguan to lay mines and block them. From the 6th to the 19th of this month, within half a month, the enemy launched six incursions to rob grain, but they were all repelled by the militia, killing, wounding and capturing 17 enemies, seizing 36 livestock, more than 10 shi of grain, a flock of sheep, and liberating 19 civilians. The larger battle was on the 19th, when the enemy dispatched more than 400 people to invade Xishi. When they were searching for grain in the village, they were suddenly surrounded by the militia of our First District. For a time, short soldiers met, and the sound of killing was everywhere. The enemy fled south in panic, abandoning grain. In this battle, three enemies were killed and wounded, 19 civilians and 17 livestock were liberated, and food was protected from being robbed by the enemy. In addition, the enemy's conspiracy to capture five recruits from each village was also thwarted. More than 40 young people from Yuzi and Nanbeibao villages have fled to our area.

　　豫北护粮斗争胜利开展
  　农民竞交反攻军粮
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫三日电】麦收甫毕，各地翻身农民争先缴纳反攻粮。不少地方超过了预定的任务。修武四区群众对比蒋伪统治时的饥饿痛苦和解放翻身后的幸福愉快，都说：“快把蒋介石打垮了吧，打垮他，咱们的日子就更好了。”该区公粮两天内即缴齐，并超过原额两万多斤。林县群众自动提出缴公粮为立功运动内容之一。武陟边沿区群众提出公粮须一干二净三重（子粒饱满）的标准，农民全体总动员，连夜肩挑背负向腹心区集中。武安矿山等六个村的农民，献公粮两万多斤，政府人员用了很大力量始说服原户，把超额数目领回，以节约备荒。
    【本报太岳三日电】经极剧烈斗争胜利完成麦收抢种的垣曲、王屋两县军民，又展开激烈的保粮保丁斗争。垣曲顽伪在破坏麦收计划失败后，近又企图以集中兵力向我边沿区抢粮抓丁。我垣曲、王屋两县指挥部早识破敌伪狡计，于麦收后即彻底实行空舍清野，每户只留一二斗粮食。垣曲一区参石、西石等村，还严订了藏粮合同，各区民兵亦在保粮、保丁号召下向敌人广泛进击，民兵活动到城关附近埋雷封锁。自本月六日至十九日半个月内，敌人曾先后六次出犯抢粮，但均被民兵击退，共毙伤俘敌十七名，夺回牲口卅六头，粮食十余石，羊一群，解放民夫十九名。其中较大战斗为十九日敌出动四百余人进犯西石，正在村内搜索粮食时，突为我一区民兵包围，一时短兵相接，杀声四起，敌怆惶弃粮南窜。是役毙伤敌三名，解放民夫十九名，牲口十七头，保卫了食粮没有被敌人抢走一粒。另敌每村抓丁五个的阴谋亦遭挫败，峪子、南北堡各村已有四十余青年逃来我区。
