　　Jinan Our Army's Combat Effectiveness Improves
  　Ready for a Major Counteroffensive
    [This newspaper's Taiyue Front, 7th dispatch] After undergoing grievance sessions and root-tracing, the political quality of soldiers in a certain unit of the Jinan People's Liberation Army has greatly improved, and they are actively preparing for a major counteroffensive. Each platoon of the 5th Company of a certain unit held platoon meetings, where everyone reviewed their ideological changes and set out plans to perform meritorious service in the major counteroffensive. New recruit Duan Tiancheng said: "The oppression I suffered in the past has been traced to its roots. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, I have been liberated. My joining the army is to defend the fruits of victory, not only to liberate Shanxi, but also to liberate all of China. My mutual aid team must do a good job, set an example, endure hardship and be willing to work hard, and capture Chiang and Yan alive to avenge our hatred." New recruit Xue Jinfu from Changzi said: "I am determined to carry the revolution through to the end and uproot Chiang Kai-shek, this old root." Liberated soldiers all discussed, "Defeat Chiang Kai-shek, liberate our homes, and follow the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party to the end." At the branch general meeting of the 4th Company, all party members expressed to the Party their desire to move out immediately. Comrade Li Chunsheng, who had just returned from the hospital, said: "When I heard that we were preparing for a counteroffensive, I rushed to the front and asked the leadership to assign me work." All the soldiers of the 4th Squad of a certain company wrote in their merit-making plan: "We will not go home until we have completely wiped out Chiang Kai-shek. During the rectification and training, we must strengthen our military and political studies. In military training, we must achieve three quicks: quick eating, quick assembly, and quick getting up. The troops must be mutually helpful, loving, and united during marches and battles, and we will go wherever we are told to go."
    [This newspaper's Taiyue, 7th dispatch] The famous enemy-killing hero Jiao Wubao's battalion, in summarizing combat mutual aid, found that three groups had captured 240 enemy soldiers, seized more than 110 rifles, 13 light machine guns, and 1 heavy machine gun. Twenty-two people performed meritorious service through mutual aid in combat, while only five individuals performed meritorious service on their own. This has drawn everyone's attention to mutual aid teams. People who previously thought that mutual aid teams had no major role are now convinced that "mutual aid is strength, and only mutual aid can lead to meritorious service." The entire battalion immediately used this fact to conduct education, introduce the benefits of mutual aid, and mobilize everyone to discuss. He Shiliang said: "I used to be a hero too. I charged ahead in every battle, but I still couldn't perform meritorious service." Wang Zicai felt the power of mutual aid from personal experience: "I couldn't seize the enemy's guns by myself when attacking Quwo. Later, I brought everyone up, and even new recruits could seize the enemy's guns." The group members said, "We couldn't have performed meritorious service without the leader leading us." Therefore, in the Xiangning battle, the soldiers freely combined to carry out mutual aid. Soldiers of the 8th Company attacked the North Mountain position and fought tenaciously under enemy fire for five hours. Whenever the groups were scattered by the enemy, the soldiers could still automatically reorganize and continue to engage in battle, or automatically join other squads and groups. Everyone also adopted a mutual aid method of learning from each other's strengths. At that time, the soldiers were faced with a five-zhang-high cliff. Yang Fengming had high grenade throwing skills and could throw them up, but Wang Changde couldn't. He then helped to uncover and pull the line, and the battle was not affected by the limitations of technology. The emergence of this kind of free combination of mutual aid on the battlefield is a continuing development of the mutual aid team, and it will also be a higher form of improving combat effectiveness and promoting collective heroism.
    [This newspaper's Taiyue, 7th dispatch] Hongdong established a front command and a large-scale joint defense with Linfen. Song Guoqiang, director of the county armed forces committee, personally led all the militiamen to establish three lines of defense, gradually advancing towards Linfen City, actively besieging and attacking the Chiang troops in various strongholds of Linfen. The first line of defense was five li away from the Xiaojiqu stronghold, and the terrain of every major and minor road and military key point was transformed and laid with various minefields, strictly sealing it off. They also established contact with the second line of defense, responding to each other at the sound of gunfire. The second line of defense was responsible for reinforcing the first line of defense and guarding the river crossings of the Fen River. The third line of defense was responsible for reinforcing the front and cooperating in carrying out various tasks in the new area. The militiamen called this layer-by-layer defense line an iron hammer. During the five-day offensive from the 20th to the 24th, the three hammers killed or wounded 16 enemy soldiers and captured two alive. On the 21st, eight enemy scouts entered the minefield and were killed by mines, including a company commander and four others. On the 24th, the enemy regiment retaliated, concentrating more than a thousand people and carrying three small cannons, dividing into two routes to attack us again. On the first line, they engaged in fierce fighting with Shang Qingfu's demolition team and others for about half an hour, killing or wounding 10 enemy soldiers below the platoon leader. The enemy advanced to the second line of defense and fell into the minefield, where another three were killed by explosions. At the same time, the southeastern Hongdong-Linfen joint team also charged towards the enemy, with gunfire erupting everywhere. Seeing that the situation was not good, the enemy fled in panic.

　　晋南我军战斗力提高
  　磨拳擦掌准备大反攻
    【本报太岳前线七日电】晋南人民解放军某部，经过诉苦追根后，战士政治素质大为提高，积极进行大反攻准备。某部五连各排都召开了排务会，每个人都检讨了思想的变化，订出大反攻中的立功计划。新战士段天成说：“过去受的压迫已经追出根，毛主席领导翻了身，我参加军队是保卫果实，不光解放山西，还要解放全中国，我的互助组一定搞好，以身作则、吃苦耐劳，活捉蒋阎报仇恨。”长子新战士薛金福说：“我决心革命到底，刨掉蒋介石这块老根。”解放战士都议论着“打垮蒋介石，解放自己的家，跟上八路军共产党干到底。”四连支部大会上，全体党员向党表示，要求立即出动。刚从医院回来的李春生同志说：“我听说要准备反攻，就急着来前方，要求上级给我分配工作。”某连四班全体战士在立功计划上写着：“不彻底消灭蒋介石我不回家，在整训中要加强我们的军事、政治学习，练兵中要作到三快：吃饭快，集合快，起床快，部队行军打仗要和全连排班互助友爱，团结起来，说打到什么地方就打到什么地方。”
    【本报太岳七日电】著名杀敌英雄焦五保营，总结战斗互助，三个小组曾俘敌二百四十名，缴获步枪一百一十余支，轻机枪十三挺，重机枪一挺。战斗中互助立功者二十二人，个人立功者仅五名。由此引起大家对互助组的重视，过去认为互助组没大作用的人，都确信“互助就是力量，只有互助才能立功”。全营即以此事实进行教育，介绍互助好处，发动大家讨论，何世亮说：“过去我也是英雄，每次战斗我冲锋在前，但还是立不下功。”王子才从亲身体验中感到互助的力量：“打曲沃光我一个人缴不到敌人的枪，后把大家都带上去，就是新战士也能缴敌人的枪。”组员们说：“不是组长带领，我们也立不了功。”因此在乡宁战斗时，战士们都自由结合，进行互助。八连战士攻入北山阵地，在敌火力下顽强战斗五小时，每当小组被敌人打散时，战士们仍能自动整顿组织，继续投入战斗，或自动参加别的班组。战斗中大家并采取了取长补短的互助方式。当时战士面临五丈高的劈坡，杨凤铭投弹技术高，能投上去，王常德投不上去，便帮助揭盖拉线，并未因技术的限制而影响战斗。此种战场自由结合的互助方式的出现，是互助组的继续发展，也将是提高战斗力，发扬集体的英雄主义的更高形式。
    【本报太岳七日电】洪洞成立前方指挥部与临汾大联防。县武委会主任宋国强亲率全部民兵建立三道防线，逐渐向临汾城推进，积极围困与打击临汾各据点蒋军。第一条防线距小蓟曲据点五里，把每一条大路小道及军事要地的地形都加以改造，布成各种雷阵，严密封锁。并与第二道防线取得联系，一有枪声互相答应。第二道防线负责增援第一道防线，及看守汾河各渡口。第三道防线负责增援前方，配合开展新区各种工作。这一层层防线，民兵称为铁锤。从二十日至二十四日五天攻势中，三锤毙伤敌十六名，生俘二名。二十一日敌尖兵八人进入雷阵，中雷毙连长以下四名。二十四日敌团报复，集中千余人，携带小炮三门，分两路向我再犯，在第一线上与尚清富爆炸队等激战约半小时，毙伤敌排长以下十名，敌再进至二道防线，陷入雷阵，又被炸死三名。同时东南洪、临联合队，又向敌冲杀，枪声四作，敌见势不佳，仓惶退走。
