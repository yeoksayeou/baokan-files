Only by Thoroughly Crushing the Landlords Can We Truly Overturn Our Lives
Re-investigation Launched in New and Old Areas of Southern Hebei
[Our newspaper's dispatch from Southern Hebei on the 17th] If the struggle is not thorough, the landlords will counterattack. The masses in the new and old areas of Southern Hebei have re-launched a re-investigation. Cadres in Qinghe are correcting their "housekeeper" mentality when it comes to letting landlords eat and drink. Yao Anliang, a traitorous landlord in Yaozhuang, Third District of Gaotang, only had one cow and 1,500 catties of grain confiscated during the first reckoning, and his ruling power was not fundamentally broken. Recently, his son, Yao Xiaoseng, attempted to retaliate by secretly inflicting two serious injuries on the Farmers' Association's cow. The masses immediately launched a second struggle, expelling his entire family of six from the village, confiscating all their property, and throwing them out on the street. The masses said: "Let's see if he still has time to cut our cows with a knife!" In Qianlizhuang, Seventh District of Shen County, the landlord used "soft tactics" to buy off village cadres because the struggle was not thorough. Last year, when village cadres went to the district to accept tasks, the landlord Li in the village set up a banquet at home to wait for them. When the village cadres were drunk and staggering, he said: "Isn't the struggle still up to the village cadres? Whoever they say belongs to what class, that's who they are." During the mass movement this spring, he vacated a house and pulled the village chief to his house to live in, and mobilized the households who had been struggled against to "warm the pot" (congratulate the move) for the village chief. Then, the local tyrant landlord Zhu Chaoxuan took out a large amount of money to open a lumber shop and a grocery store for the village chief and the director of the Farmers' Association. After repeated education, the director of the Farmers' Association recognized the class enemy and recently led the masses to capture the two landlords. The masses were greatly encouraged and immediately held a mass meeting to struggle against them. The village cadres who had been bought off also made self-criticisms, and a large amount of supplies were confiscated. The masses said: "Let's struggle against the landlords until they are penniless, and see what they use to buy people off." After two mass movements, the landlords in Liu Baozhuang, Second District of Qinghe, were not completely eliminated. The six landlord households, with 35 people, were left with an average of 4.8 mu of land per person. The 139 old poor peasant households, with 617 people, only had an average of 1.6 mu of land per person. The 11 extremely poor households, with 24 people, were only supplemented to an average of 1.6 mu per person. But the landlords still hated them to the bone and even set fire to the house of Yao Zengqi, the director of the Farmers' Association. At the "July 1st" commemoration and reflection meeting, the director of the Farmers' Association swore to lead everyone in doing a good job. The masses all said: "The more lenient we are to the landlords, the more they will punch us. We can't be ruthless, but they are very vicious." The leadership also made a self-criticism, saying: "In the past, we were so thoughtful about what the landlords ate and drank, and the accounts we kept for them, as if we were their housekeepers!" Therefore, they proposed: "Only when the landlords are completely crushed, and they are like stray dogs with their tails between their legs, can the poor truly turn over." The masses immediately confiscated the landlords' 16 mu of land, houses, courtyards, furniture, etc. The masses said: "It should have been done this way a long time ago." The village is currently distributing the fruits of labor and engaging in production, and will continue to conduct re-investigations.

    把地主彻底摧垮才算翻透身
    冀南新老区重起复查
    【本报冀南十七日电】斗争不彻底，地主要反攻，冀南新老区群众重起进行复查。清河干部纠正对地主留吃喝时的“管家”思想。高唐三区姚庄汉奸地主姚安良，第一次清算，只斗出牛一头，粮食一千五百斤，统治威风根本没有打垮。最近，其子姚小僧企图报复，将农会的牛偷偷砍了两处重伤。群众立即展开二次斗争，将其全家六口驱逐出村，全部财产没收，扫地出门。群众说：“看看他还顾得用刀砍咱的牛不！”莘县七区前李庄地主因斗争不彻底，收买村干，实行“软攻”。去年村干到区接受任务时，该村地主李某在家摆着酒席等着，村干喝得东倒西歪时，他说：“斗争还不是村干当家吗？说谁是啥阶层，谁就是啥阶层。”今春群运时，他腾出房子，将村长拉到他家去住，并发动被斗户给村长“温锅”（祝贺迁居之意）。接着恶霸地主朱朝选拿出大量资金给村长、农会主任开木匹铺、杂货铺。农会主任几经教育，认清阶级敌人，最近领导群众将两个地主捕捉起来。群情大振，当即开大会斗争，被收买的村干也作了反省，斗出大批物资。群众说：“把地主斗成穷光蛋，看他使啥收买。”清河二区刘保庄经过两次群运，地主未被消灭彻底。地主六户，三十五口，平均每人留四亩八分地。老贫农一百三十九户，六百一十七口，每人才平均一亩六分地。赤贫十一户，二十四口人，只补到每人平均一亩六分。但地主仍恨得咬牙切齿，曾给农会主任姚增齐放火。在纪念“七一”想想会上，农会主任宣誓领导大家干，全体群众说：“对地主多么宽，反倒叫地主打了一拳。咱下不了狠心，人家可毒哩。”领导上也作了检讨说：“过去对地主留的吃喝，算的帐，给人家管家，也不过这样周到呀”，遂提出：“只有地主彻底摧垮，叫他们象丧家狗，夹着尾巴，穷人才会彻底翻身。”群众即将地主的十六亩地、宅子、场院、家具等完全没收。群众说：“早就该这样。”该村正在分果实和生产，还要继续复查。
