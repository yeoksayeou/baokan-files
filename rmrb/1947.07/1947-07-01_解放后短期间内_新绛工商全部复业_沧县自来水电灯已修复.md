Xinhua News Agency, Lvliang, 28th: Within two months of liberation, all of the more than 500 private businesses in Xinjian County, a famous commercial city in southern Shanxi, have resumed operations. Among them are more than 120 small factories and workshops for cotton weaving and cigarette production. Before the war, Xinjian was a distribution center for goods from 36 counties in southern Shanxi, with more than 2,000 stores and 350 handicraft workshops for cotton weaving, fur, writing brushes, ink, and cigarettes. There were also two modernized factories for matches and textiles. After years of rule by the Japanese puppets and Chiang Kai-shek/Yan Xishan, industry and commerce gradually declined, with less than a quarter of them remaining. This spring alone, the Yan regime extorted more than 214 million "legal tender" from merchants and residents in the urban area, and "conscripted" 100 soldiers from merchants, with a price of 1.5 million yuan for buying a replacement. Large enterprises in the city, such as the Zhao Tai Factory, which was established in 1921, were all occupied by Jinxing Enterprise Company, a Shanxi industrial trust controlled by Yan Xishan. The manager of Zhao Tai Factory, Mr. Fu, was even detained for resisting and was only released from prison after the People's Liberation Army entered the city. After the city was liberated in early April, the democratic government immediately announced a policy of protecting private businesses, providing loans of 5 million Jicha (equivalent to 50 million Chiang Kai-shek currency) to small handicraft industries and distributing 400 dan of relief flour to workers. It also mobilized merchants from old liberated areas to sell a large number of local products such as mountain goods and medicinal materials, while purchasing cloth and various necessities, which led to rapid sales of various goods in Xinjiang, with supply falling short of demand. A large number of unemployed workers obtained jobs. Currently, prices have generally fallen, with wheat falling by 15% to 1,200 Jicha per large dou, and sorghum falling by about 25% to 200 yuan per dou.

　　解放后短期间内
  　新绛工商全部复业
  　沧县自来水电灯已修复
    【新华社吕梁廿八日电】晋南著名商业城市新绛县，解放两月，全城五百余私人商业已全部复业。其中有棉织、卷烟等小型工厂作坊一百二十余家。新绛战前为晋南三十六县货物集散地，拥有商店两千余家，棉织、皮毛、笔墨、卷烟等手工业作坊三百五十余家，并有火柴、纺织等近代化工厂两家。经日伪蒋阎多年统治，工商业逐年萎缩，残存者不足四分之一。阎政权今春三个月即向城关商民勒索“法币”两亿一千四百余万元；向商户“征兵”一百名，买丁一名为一百五十万元。该城大企业如民国十年开办的招泰工厂等，皆为阎锡山控制的山西工业托拉斯晋兴企业公司所霸占。招泰厂经理傅某并因反抗被扣押，直至解放军进城后始由监狱放出。四月初旬该城解放后，民主政府立即宣布保护私人商业政策，给小手工业贷款冀钞五百万元（合蒋币五千万元）向工人发救济粉四百石。并发动老解放区商买带来大批山货药材等土产出售，同时采购布匹及各种必需品，遂使新绛各货销售极速，供不应求。大批失业工人获得工作。现物价普遍下跌，麦每大斗冀钞一千二百元，下跌百分之十五，高粱每斗二百元，下跌约四分之一。
