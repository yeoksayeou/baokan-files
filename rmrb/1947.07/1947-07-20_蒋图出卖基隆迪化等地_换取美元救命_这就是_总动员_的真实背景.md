    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th. The New York Afternoon reported on June 15th, carrying a Washington dispatch: Zhou Shukai, the private secretary of Wang Shijie, the Foreign Minister of the Chiang government, who arrived in Washington, D.C., submitted to the U.S. government a plan by the Chiang government to sell China's sovereignty in exchange for U.S. loans to tide over this year's difficulties. The report stated: The content of the plan proposed that the United States provide another new loan of one to one and a half billion U.S. dollars; the Chiang side would agree to offer Qingdao and Taiwan's Keelung and Taipei as U.S. bases, and could even consider selling Dihua, Xi'an, and Chengdu. The report pointed out the Chiang government's financial difficulties and then stated: Even if it could obtain this loan of one to one and a half billion U.S. dollars, it could not last long. Chiang Kai-shek threatened the United States, saying that if the United States relaxed its assistance to him, he would not be able to continue the civil war. Zhang Pingqun, the Chinese (Chiang government) Consul General in New York, said at a meeting of American students of the Central Training Corps held at He Yingqin's residence on Long Island last month: Marshall has promised to give Chiang Kai-shek substantial assistance. This news from the Afternoon provides an important explanation for Chiang Kai-shek's recent announcement of "total mobilization" and the background of Wedemeyer's dispatch to China, which deserves serious attention from the people of the whole country.

    蒋图出卖基隆迪化等地
    换取美元救命  这就是“总动员”的真实背景
    【新华社陕北十七日电】纽约下午报六月十五日载华盛顿讯：抵达华府的蒋政府外长王世杰私人秘书周树楷，曾经有蒋政府以出卖中国主权换取美国借款以渡今年难关之计划，递交美政府。该报称：该计划内容系提议美国供给另一个十亿至十五亿美元的新借款；蒋方则允以青岛和台湾的基隆、台北作为美国的基地，甚至可以考虑迪化、西安和成都的出卖。该报指出蒋政府之财政困难后称：即使能得到此项十亿到十五亿美元的贷款，亦不能维持多久。蒋介石曾向美国威胁说：如美国放松对他的援助，他即不能继续内战。中国（蒋政府）驻纽约总领事张平群，上月在长岛何应钦寓所举行的中央训练团留美学员大会上说：马歇尔已答应给蒋介石以实质的援助。下午报的这个消息，对于最近蒋介石的宣布“总动员”和魏德迈被派来华的背景，提供了重要的说明，值得全国人民严重注意。
