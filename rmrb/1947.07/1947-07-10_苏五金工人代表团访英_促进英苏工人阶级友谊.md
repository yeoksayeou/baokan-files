　　Soviet Metalworkers Delegation Visits Britain
  　Promote Anglo-Soviet Working-Class Friendship
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd] (TASS London dispatch): The Soviet metalworkers delegation, invited to visit Britain, returned to the Soviet Union on the 1st. During their week-long stay in Britain, the delegation toured the northern provinces of England. However, due to various obstructions from the upper echelons of the British Trades Union Congress under Labor Party control, the Soviet representatives only attended one workers' rally in Middlesbrough, attended by only 150 people. Furthermore, during visits to certain factories, only twenty or thirty specially selected individuals were organized to meet the Soviet delegation; they were not actually workers. On June 27th, at the official farewell banquet given by the Executive Committee of the British Metalworkers' Trade Union Federation for the Soviet delegation, the head of the Soviet delegation, Yevstratov, expressed regret in his reply that they were unable to freely contact British workers during their stay in Britain. He continued: "From our conversations with factory workers, we are convinced that British metalworkers desire to strengthen worker solidarity and friendship between the British and Soviet peoples. The workers unanimously told us that they do not believe the reactionary newspapers engaged in anti-Soviet propaganda, and they often hoped that the visit of the Soviet delegation to Britain and its contact with British workers would be conducive to enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the British and Soviet working classes; such understanding and friendship are very important for establishing a stable peace."

　　苏五金工人代表团访英
  　促进英苏工人阶级友谊
    【新华社陕北三日电】综合塔斯社伦敦讯：应邀赴英参观之苏联五金工人代表团，已于一日返苏。在共旅英之一周间，代表团曾游历了英国北部各省。但由于工党控制下英国职工会上层分子之种种阻挠，苏代表仅参加了一次在密德尔斯布罗举行的只有一百五十人的工人集会，而在参观某些工厂时，更有二三十个特选的人物，有组织地来接见苏代表团，他们实际上并不是工人。上月二十七日，在英国五金工人职工会联合会执委会正式饯别苏联代表团的宴会上，苏联代表团团长叶夫斯特拉托夫致答词时，对旅英期间未能与英工人自由接触，表示遗憾。继称：从我们和工厂工人的交谈里，我们深信英国五金工人愿望加强工人的团结，和英苏两国人民间的友谊。工人一致地告诉我们，他们不相信进行反苏宣传的反动报纸，他们常常希望苏联代表团的访英和它与英国工人的接触将有利于英苏工人阶级间相互了解和友谊的增进；这种了解和友谊对建立稳定的和平是很重要的。
