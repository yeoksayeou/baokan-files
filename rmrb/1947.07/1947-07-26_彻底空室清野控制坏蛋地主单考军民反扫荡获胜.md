　　(Late arrival) Before the counter-offensive army crossed the river, the military and civilians in Shan (County) East and Kaocheng persisted in the struggle behind enemy lines, smashing the enemy's continuous "sweeps." On June 10th, two regiments of the Chiang Kai-shek's 79th Brigade, combined with Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops from (Jinxiang), Feng (County), Yu (Tai) and other counties, totaling more than 4,000 people, under the command of Tang, the brigade commander of the 139th Brigade, carried out a brutal "destructive sweep" of our central areas of Guo Tang, Cai Liu, and Wu Liu in Shan (County) East. Our Shan East people used tunnels, implemented an empty village strategy, and controlled bad elements, causing the enemy's policies of burning, killing, raping, and looting to fail completely. When the enemy's sweep began, the masses buried all their belongings, and in villages close to the strongholds, each village only left an empty house, and the elderly, weak, and women were sent to more distant places. The young and middle-aged men worked close to the enemy's strongholds, rushing to get things done. When they came home, they only brought a little flour, dug out the pot to cook, ate, and then buried it again. When the enemy came, they left, and when the enemy left, they came back to produce. Because the enemy could not get anything to eat in the strongholds, they had to boil wheat grains to eat. During the sweep, they could not catch ordinary people or find furniture. During the most severe sweep, a bad element in Guo Tang District secretly aided the enemy, but before the things were sent, he was executed by the government. From then on, this evil trend was suppressed, and each village used this example for propaganda. Villages closest to the enemy's strongholds, if propaganda was difficult, sent out notices, which the masses happily applauded. Whenever the enemy arrived in a village, the masses of that village had completely fled, and the bad elements were very isolated at home. Later, even the bad landlords fled with the masses. Everyone also monitored the bad elements on the one hand, and organized small armed forces to actively operate on the other hand. Every night, they would patrol the stubborn and fugitive landlords and the home-returning legions near the strongholds, so that they would not dare to return home to operate. Therefore, in the entire central area of Shan East, no one has aided the enemy yet. Although the enemy brought in more than 200 intelligence groups organized by special agents, they did not play a role. Even the Baojia in his own stronghold, Caolou, was not organized. For more than half a month, no one was found returning to the village. As a result, the enemy's "sweep" returned without results.

　　At the same time, the military and civilians in Kaocheng also smashed the enemy's continuous thirteen-day "mopping-up sweep." The 429th Regiment of the 143rd Brigade of the Chiang Kai-shek army, in coordination with local bandits, penetrated deep into our Kaocheng central area in early June to carry out a "mopping-up sweep," implementing the three-all policy, burning, killing, and looting everywhere, attempting to "cleanse" our guerrilla base areas, and repeatedly swept for thirteen consecutive days. But under the heroic fighting of our military and civilians, it was finally smashed. The Ma Zhenqing Guerrilla Team, which persisted in local struggle, and the martial work teams and militias in various districts, carried out anti-traitor liquidation in the anti-sweeping, making the masses more united and strengthening their confidence in victory. After the Chiang Kai-shek army's "mopping-up sweep" was completely smashed, the local armed guerrillas again carried out land reform everywhere, eradicating the bad elements who colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek army and committed crimes during the sweep.

　　彻底空室清野控制坏蛋地主单考军民反扫荡获胜
    【本报冀鲁豫十五日电】（迟到）在反攻大军过河之前，单（县）东及考城军民坚持敌后斗争，粉碎了敌人的连续“扫荡”。六月十日，蒋军七十九旅两个团、结合（金乡）丰（县）鱼（台）等县的蒋伪军共四千余人，由一三九旅旅长唐某指挥对我单（县）东郭堂、蔡溜、吴溜等中心区实行惨无人道的“毁灭扫荡”，我单东人民利用地道、实行空室清野、控制坏分子，使敌人烧杀奸淫抢掠等政策全部失败。当敌人扫荡开始时，群众将所有的东西都埋藏起来，离据点近的村庄，各村只留下了一口空房，老弱妇女，都送到较远的地方。青壮年靠近敌人据点，突击干活，他们来家时只带一点面，将锅扒出来煮饭，吃罢饭又埋起来，敌来就走，敌人走了他们就回来生产，敌人因据点内搞不上东西吃，只得煮麦粒吃；扫荡时抓不到老百姓，找不到家具。在扫荡最严重时，郭堂区有一个坏分子暗中资敌，东西还未送，就被政府枪决了。从此这股邪气镇压下去，各庄也以此例子进行宣传，离敌人据点最近的村子，不好宣传，就写了帖子送去，群众纷纷称快。敌人每到一村，那村的群众都完全跑光，坏分子在家也很孤立。后来连坏蛋地主也都跟群众跑了。大家又一方面监视坏分子，一面组织小股武装，积极活动。每天晚上，都把据点附近的顽固及逃亡地主，还乡团摸一遍，使他不敢回家活动。因此，做到了整个单东中心区还没一个人资敌的，敌人虽然带来了二百多特务组织的情报团，也没起作用，连他自己的据点草楼里面的保甲，也没编制起来。半个多月也没找到一个回庄去的，结果敌人“扫荡”无结果而回。
    同时，考城军民也粉碎了敌人连续十三天的“清剿扫荡”。蒋军一四三旅四二九团，配合土顽自六月初深入我考城中心区“清剿扫荡”，实行三光政策，到处烧杀抢掠，企图“清洗”我游击根据地，反复连续扫荡十三天之久。但在我军民英勇战斗下，终于被粉碎了。坚持当地斗争的马振清游击队，及各区武工队民兵，在反扫荡中进行反奸清算，使群众更加团结，坚定了胜利信心。蒋军“清剿扫荡”完全被粉碎之后，地方武装游击队，又到处进行土地改革，铲除扫荡中勾搭蒋军为非作歹的坏分子。
