Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 19th—The Chiang Kai-shek servants in Luoyang are in a state of extreme panic upon hearing that a part of Liu Bocheng's main force has moved south. The city is under constant curfew, and prices have risen fivefold. At various river crossings along the river, there are several alarms a day. At night, searchlights crisscross, and passwords are heard constantly. The Chiang 10th Special Commissioner's Office convened a so-called "security" meeting, deciding to build a fortress more than ten feet high, capable of holding two to three hundred people, at the central location of every six "bao." River defense troops are reinforcing fortifications, ordering each "bao" to provide fifteen men. The "price" of able-bodied men has now risen to 13 million Chiang currency per person. Chiang's 15th Division has plastered all kinds of slogans, saying it will "coexist and perish" with the city, indicating that they have lost confidence, further increasing the atmosphere of panic in the city.

　　我军反攻威震洛阳蒋家臣仆肉跳心惊
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十九日电】洛阳蒋家臣仆，闻悉刘伯承主力一部南下，恐慌万状，城内终日戒严，物价陡涨五倍。沿河各渡口，一日数惊，入夜手电四射，口令声不绝于耳。蒋第十专署特召开所谓“治安”会议，决定每六个保的中心地点修一高丈余、能容二三百人之寨子。河防部队则增修工事，勒令每保出丁十五人，现壮丁“价格”已涨至每名蒋币一千三百万元。蒋军第十五师遍贴形形色色标语，说要与城“共存亡”，说明彼等业已丧失信心，益增市内恐慌空气。
