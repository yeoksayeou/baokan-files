Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. TASS published a communiqué on the 11th, refuting the statement made by the Chiang government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 25th of last month, which slandered the Soviet Union for obstructing the takeover of Lushun and Dalian, violating the Sino-Soviet Treaty. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Moscow on the 11th, the TASS communiqué stated: "As early as December 1945 and January 1946, the Soviet military authorities notified Chinese representatives that the Soviet Union intended to provide all assistance to China in establishing a government in Dalian. However, although China appointed local officials, none of them went to Dalian to take office. Therefore, in December 1946, the Soviet side again requested the Chinese government to reappoint officials to Dalian and Lushun, and then made another request on March 7, 1947, but received no reply. Therefore, the Chinese Foreign Ministry's communiqué's claim that the Soviet Union obstructed the takeover is inconsistent with the facts and will lead those who do not know the truth to draw wrong conclusions. Furthermore, the Chinese communiqué's claim that the CCP is increasing its forces by using the Lüda area is also completely unfounded, as there are no CCP troops in that area. Moreover, China's dispatch of troops to the Lushun naval base violates Article 4 of the Sino-Soviet Agreement, which entrusts the defense of the area to the Soviet Union, and therefore does not allow Chinese troops to be stationed there. Also, the agreement on Dalian does not allow Chinese troops to be stationed within the city, and during the war against Japan, Dalian should be managed by the military government of the wartime naval district. At present, the treaty with Japan has not yet been concluded, and it is still in a state of war against Japan, so Dalian is still under the management of the military government. The Soviet government has always carefully abided by the treaty and believes that both sides have this responsibility. China's request to send troops to the Lushun naval base and Dalian is a violation of this agreement. The Soviet government believes that there is no reason whatsoever for the Chinese government's claim that the Chinese government in the area cannot perform its duties without Chinese military assistance, because the Soviet government allows the Chinese police to be sent to the area, which is sufficient to maintain order. As for China's claim that Dong Yanping and his party did not receive cooperation from the Soviet side, it is also inconsistent with the facts. The inspection group led by Dong was given ample opportunity to inspect the situation in Lüda, and the group was assisted by the Soviet side in inspecting public organizations, industrial groups, railways, and the port of Dalian, and the Soviet side provided materials for the questions they asked. When the group said goodbye, its Foreign Ministry representative expressed gratitude for the Soviet cooperation. The Soviet Union has fulfilled its obligations in supporting and providing military assistance to the Chinese government and respecting China's sovereignty in the three northeastern provinces. It cleared the Japanese army in the three northeastern provinces, and then withdrew its troops in order to respect China's sovereignty. In summary, the Chinese Foreign Ministry's communiqué is a deliberate distortion of the facts, aimed at assisting the anti-Soviet movement that is currently underway, which is completely in line with the interests of some Chinese and foreign people, in order to divert the general public's attention from its domestic situation."

    蒋党诬蔑苏联阻碍接收旅大
    完全是恶意歪曲事实
    塔斯社发表公报痛予驳斥
    【新华社陕北十三日电】塔斯社十一日发表公报，驳斥上月廿五日蒋政府外交部诬蔑苏联阻碍接收旅顺、大连违反中苏条约之声明。据中央社莫斯科十一日专电，塔斯社公报称：“苏军当局早在一九四五年十二月及一九四六年一月，即通知中国代表，苏联拟对中国在大连成立政府事，给予一切协助。然中国虽任命当地官员，迄无一人前往大连就职。因此苏方于一九四六年十二月再度要求中国政府，重新任命大连、旅顺官员，其后在一九四七年三月七日又提要求，惟未获答复。因之中国外交部公报中所称苏联阻挠一节，与事实不符，并将使不明真相者发生错误结论。又中国公报所称中共借旅大二地区增加兵力一节，亦毫无根据。因该区并无中共军队。又中国派兵至旅顺海军基地，系违反中苏协定第四条，该条为中国将防务委托与苏联，因之自不准中国军队驻屯该区。又关于大连之协定，亦不准中国驻军市区之内，而在对日作战时期，大连应受战时海军区之军政府管理。目前对日本和约尚未缔结，仍处对日作战状态，故大连仍归军政府管理。苏联政府一向审慎遵守条约，并认为双方均有此种责任。中国之要求派遣军队至旅顺海军基地及大连，实属违反此种协定。苏联政府对中国政府所称中国在该地之政府如无中国军事协助即不能执行任务一节，认为无任何理由，因苏联政府允许中国派往该地之警察，即可充分维持秩序故也。至于中国所谓董彦平一行未获苏方合作一节，亦与事实不符。董氏领导之视察团获得充分机会视察旅大之情形，该团并得苏方协助视察公共团体与工业团体、铁路及大连港口，苏方且就彼等所询问之问题提供材料。该团辞别时，其外交部代表曾对苏之合作表示感谢。苏联在支持及以军事援助予中国政府以及尊重中国在东北三省之主权方面，均已履行其义务。在东北三省内肃清日军，其后为尊重中国之主权而又撤退其军队。综上所述，中国外交部之公报实属蓄意歪曲事实，旨在协助刻正进行中之反苏运动，此与若干中国及外国人士之旨趣完全符合，以转移一般人对其国内情势问题之注意力。”
