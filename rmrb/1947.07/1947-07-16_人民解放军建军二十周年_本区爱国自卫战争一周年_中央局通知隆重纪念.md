    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] August 1st is the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the first anniversary of the Patriotic Self-Defense War in this region. Moreover, our region happens to be the first to launch the prelude to the nationwide counter-offensive before this year's "August 1st," with our army advancing south and achieving great victories. A new democratic upsurge in China will rapidly arrive. To commemorate this great festival, the CCP Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau issued a notice to the entire region's Party on the 5th of this month, pointing out that everything now depends on how to quickly win victory. Commemorating "August 1st" should first and foremost promote the heroic fighting spirit of our army over the past twenty years, strengthen combat will, and enhance the confidence of the entire region's military and civilians in victory. Secondly, it should expose the corruption and incompetence of the Chiang government, publicize the glorious achievements of our army, and carry out political offensives towards the border areas and the KMT-controlled areas. Regarding the content of the propaganda, it was pointed out that emphasis should be placed on the development history of the Red Army, the Eighth Route Army, and the New Fourth Army, especially the brilliant achievements of the regular army and militia during the year of the self-defense war. Use concrete facts to elaborate on Chairman Mao's military building thought and strategic and tactical thought, explaining that victory is possible as long as there is the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Use the fact that the people in the rear enthusiastically join the army, participate in the war, and support the front lines to educate the troops and the people, explaining that the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal war is a people's war, and victory is possible as long as there is close unity between the military and the people and a strong People's Liberation Army. Despise Chiang Kai-shek, point out that the United States is not to be feared, and instill the idea that "as long as we dare to win, we can win" into the masses. However, it is also necessary to promote the tradition of hard struggle of our military and civilians, resolutely overcome difficulties, guard against arrogance and impatience, and be prepared for a long-term struggle. Regarding the celebration methods, it was pointed out that in addition to holding celebration meetings in the troops and agency residences, various discussion meetings can be held to commend the army and celebrate the achievements of the masses with a spirit of love and support, and to reward heroes who killed the enemy, militia heroes, war participation heroes, and production and frugality models. The time frame is half a month, from July 20th to August 5th. The external political offensive will be specifically arranged and carried out by each region. It is hoped that the various activities, models of love and support, and typical examples of supporting the front lines and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers and martyrs will be written into news reports. Each region will be under the unified leadership of the regional Party committee for specific arrangements, and will be carried out effectively without hindering war production; and must take into account the principle of economy, strive for practical results, and avoid extravagance and waste.
