Shannandi in Southern Shanxi: Mutual Teaching and Learning During Thinning
　　Improving Techniques to Ensure Increased Production
　　Every Group Elects a Technician to Do What They Say
[Our Newspaper News] In Shannandi, First District of Pingshun, technical leadership has taken a step forward during thinning. This village is a medium-level village in the first district in terms of agricultural production. In terms of technology, it is the same as ordinary villages. Every time an agricultural activity comes, it is necessary to study the technology, but the methods studied often cannot be truly implemented. Or, the first day of research is done that way, and the second day is not done that way. This has become a major problem for further improving technology. The following methods were adopted in the technical leadership of this thinning to implement doing what is said.
　　1. The combination of the Technical Committee and the mutual aid team is the main link to ensure doing what is said. The whole village has a mutual aid society, three mutual aid brigades, and thirteen mutual aid groups. Each group selects a technical committee member, and each team selects a technical instructor. In addition, the whole village also has three ex officio members (production director, labor hero, farmers' association chairman), and the production director is elected as the director of the Technical Committee. The root of the Technical Committee is in the masses. The technical committee members lead and research while working in the group, and then convene the village's Technical Committee for unified research, so the technology researched is easy to implement.
　　2. Break down obstacles to the implementation of technical thinking and promote mutual learning. Some members of the group have the idea that as long as you apply more fertilizer and it rains more, the crops will grow well, and talking about technology is not a big deal. Geng Wenlin said: "Fertilizer is enough, I don't believe in skillful work, you should apply fertilizer skillfully." Old man Shen Yuanhe said: "No matter how you study the plan (technology), you can't plan for rain." This kind of thinking hindered the implementation of technology. Later, the idea was to compare five or six mu of land per household, what to eat if it is not done well, the same land, two different kinds of work, and two different harvests, which cleared up the thinking, so that technology was valued. In order to improve the thinning technology, the group members pointed out their own problems while thinning. For example, Dao Hai said: "I have this problem, I don't go to the ground to weed, I leave the seedlings heavy." He Fu said: "I can't weed well, I don't know how to surround the soil." One by one, they all said their own problems and supervised each other, setting off a wave of mutual teaching and learning. For example, when Shen Fusheng's group was thinning three mu of land, Shen Liuze and Shen Laitai held Pang Ze's hand and taught him how to weed. Wang Anhu first showed the sample of weeding, teaching those who couldn't weed to follow it, so the technology improved day by day. He Fu's weeding of cotton fields was rated as the first-class technical expert in the village.
　　3. Creating a technical contracting method is the key to turning spoken technology into manual technology and doing what is said. This kind of contracting is also called temporary small contracting by the villagers, focusing on technology. Taking Shen Fusheng's group as an example, the group went to ×× to weed the seedlings, a total of nine people. They saw with their own eyes that the clods of land were large, the seedlings were sparse and uneven, some were high and some were low, and some small seedlings died. Based on this situation, it was decided that: one seedling should temporarily retain five or six plants, with a spacing of two to two and a half fingers, and no seedlings should be left between the bean plants. One mu of land was determined to be contracted for four Erfen work points. In order to achieve the set technical standards, after weeding for a while, a preliminary inspection was carried out, and a technical deduction of work points was carried out after weeding. For example, Shen Kai did not clear the seedlings between the plants, and deducted Erfen work points. Guo Zhangju's hoe did not reach the ground, and deducted Yifen work points. The whole group contracted 21.3 mu of seedlings in five days, originally contracted for 41.6 work points, and actually completed 36 work points, saving 5.6 work points. Since this was implemented, the technology has been greatly improved. Among the 21.3 mu of land contracted, 13.5 mu met the first-class standard, and 7.5 mu met the second-class standard. There was no third-class land, achieving both speed and quality.
　　The whole village conducted two inspections during thinning. In the first inspection, the first-class land accounted for 6.4 percent, the second-class land accounted for 83.5 percent, and the third-class land accounted for 10.1 percent. In the second inspection, the first-class land accounted for 21.6 percent, the second-class land accounted for 50.8 percent, and the third-class land accounted for 27.1 percent. The first-class increased, the second-class decreased, and the third-class increased. The reason is that the second inspection standard was high, and the auxiliary labor could not weed. In short, Shannandi can do what it says in terms of technology during thinning, turning spoken technology into manual technology. This is a great creation and the key to improving agricultural technology at present. (Special Commissioner Communication)

### 山南底锄苗中互教互学　提高技术保证增产　每组选有技术员说到做到

　　山南底锄苗中互教互学
  　提高技术保证增产
  　每组选有技术员说到做到
    【本报讯】平顺一区山南底锄苗中，技术领导提高一步。该村在农业生产上是一区的中等村，在技术上和一般村一样，每遇一项农事活动来到，都要研究一下技术，可是研究出的办法往往不能真正做到。或者研究罢第一天是照那样做，第二天就不那样做了。这就成了技术再提高一步的大问题。此次锄苗中在技术领导上采取了以下办法，贯彻了说到做到。
    一、技委会和互助组相结合，是说到做到主要的环节，全村有一个互助社，三个互助大队，下有十三个互助小组，每组选一技术委员，每队选一个技术指导员。另外全村还有三个当然委员（生产主任、劳动英雄、农会主席），推选生产主任党技委会的主任，技委会的根是扎到群众中。技术委员在组内一面做活一面领导研究，再召集全村技术委员会统一研究，这样研究出的技术容易做到。
    二、打破贯彻技术思想阻碍，提倡互做互学。在组员中有些存在一种：只要多上肥，多下雨，庄稼就能长好，讲技术不顶多大事情的想法。耿文林说：“肥大就行，不信巧做造，还应该巧上肥”。申元和老汉说：“不管你怎样研究计划（技术），也计划不下雨来。”这种思想又阻碍了对技术的贯彻，后用每家五、六亩地，做不好吃什么，来对比一样地两样做造，两样收成，打通了思想，这样才对技术重视起来。为了提高锄苗技术，组员们一边锄苗，一边啦自己的毛病。如道孩说：“我有这个毛病，不下地锄，留茁重。”河福说：“我锄不好，不会围土。”一个一个都把自己的毛病说出，互相监督，掀起了互教互学的热潮。如申福胜组在三亩地锄苗时，申六则，申来太捉着胖则手拿着锄教。王安虎是先锄样子，教不会锄的人照着锄，这样技术一天比一天提高了。河福锄棉花地，全村评定为第一份技术好手。
    三、创技术包工办法，这是说到做到把口头技术变成手头技术的关键。这种包工老乡们也叫临时小包工，着重在技术上。以申福胜组做榜样说，该组在××地锄苗，共去九人，亲眼看住他那块地圪拉大，苗子稀稠不匀，有高有低，还有些小苗死了。根据这种情况决定：一安暂留五、六棵，株距二指至二指半，不留夹安豆子，一亩地确定四个二分工包出，为了实现所定的技术标准，锄了一歇，即初步进行检查，锄完时进行检查与技术折工。如申开只没有把棵间苗拔清楚，少折二分工，郭张巨锄头没有走到，少折一分工，全组在五天以内共包工二十一亩三分苗，原包为四十一个六分工，实行了三十六个工，省五个六分工。自这样实行起以后，技术大为提高，在包工的二十一亩三分地内，有十三亩半，合头等标准，七亩半合二等标准，没有三等地，做到了又快又好。
    全村在锄苗中，共进行了二次检查，第一次头等地占百分之六点四，二等地占百分之八十三点五，三等地占百分之十点一。第二次检查头等地占百分之二十一点六，二等地占百分之五十点八，三等地占百分之二十七点一。一等增多，二等减少，三等增多。其原因是二次检查标准高，与辅助劳力不会锄苗。总之，山南底在锄苗中对技术能说到做到，把口头上的技术变为手头的技术，这是很大一个创造，是目前提高农业技术的关键。（专署通讯）
