　　Responding to Chairman Mao's Call to Welcome the Counter-Offensive
  　Determined to Eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's Rule
  　32nd Brigade Inspects Strength
    [Report from the North Henan Front, Our Newspaper, 28th] The People's Liberation Army's 32nd Brigade, a certain unit, held a grand inspection of its strength on the eve of the counter-offensive on the 19th of this month. A reviewing stand was erected high in the inspection grounds, surrounded by large red and green character slogans. At 3:00 AM, units of troops marched into the inspection grounds facing the gentle morning breeze. The soldiers, dressed in new uniforms and armed with new weapons, looked even more valiant and vigorous in the faint morning light. At approximately 4:00 AM, the inspection began. Neat formations stretching for several miles were arrayed before the reviewing stand. Military music played in unison as the leaders of the brigade passed from east to west in front of the troops. Thunderous slogans erupted from the ranks: "Intensify technical training, enhance our combat effectiveness!" "Respond to Chairman Mao's call, resolutely carry out the great counter-offensive!" After the inspection, the leader of the 32nd Brigade ascended the platform and delivered a speech. He pointed out that this inspection proved that our People's Liberation Army is becoming stronger with each battle, while the fascist Chiang army is becoming weaker with each battle. He also pointed out that today we have grasped the initiative in the war. We must resolutely carry out the great counter-offensive to achieve a complete victory in the patriotic self-defense war. He called on the entire army to resolutely complete the three major tasks in the great counter-offensive: winning battles, implementing land reform, and executing regulations, thoroughly eliminate the Chiang bandit's rule, and achieve victory in the democratic revolution. At this moment, the rising sun shone brightly, with rosy clouds filling the sky. All the soldiers stood up, and led by Political Commissar ×, the entire army recited the oath: "We are the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the advanced revolutionary soldiers. We will liberate all the oppressed people of China. We will respond to Chairman Mao's call to welcome a new upsurge in the national democratic revolution. We will resolutely carry out the great counter-offensive. We will thoroughly eliminate the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and establish an independent, free, and happy New China..." The meeting ended at 6:30 AM. (Ge Luo) (Attached picture)
