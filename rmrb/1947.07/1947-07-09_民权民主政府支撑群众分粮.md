[This report from the Jilu豫 (Hebei-Shandong-Henan) area on the 7th of this month] The civil rights and democratic government of Minquan County, along the Longhai Railway, is using administrative power to rapidly advance the movement of grain and property distribution. The county seat of Minquan is still in enemy hands, and the masses have many concerns. After the First District was recovered by our army, it immediately called on the masses to distribute the wheat of the pseudo-landlords. The masses were afraid of being reported by the pseudo-landlords and were not enthusiastic. Cadres knew that the masses wanted to, but dared not, so they took the initiative to confiscate 1,500 jin of wheat from the local tyrant and landlord Zhang Maode. Then, they mobilized an old man and an old woman to take cloth bags to collect grain. They walked through the streets, which emboldened other people, and they followed in twos and threes, totaling more than 40 people, quickly distributing the wheat. The next day, they struggled against the landlord Zhang Bingen, and the masses who distributed grain yesterday became the leading activists today. Those picking up wheat on the ground and the masses from nearby villages all competed to participate in the struggle. A total of more than 24,000 jin of wheat and some movable property were investigated and distributed to the masses of 14 villages. The masses were extremely excited and told each other, "We won't go hungry now!"

　　民权民主政府支撑群众分粮
    【本报冀鲁豫七日电】陇海路上民权县广大乡村民主政府运用行政力量，分粮分财运动迅速展开。该县县城仍在敌手，群众顾虑较多。一区为我军收复后，即号召群众分伪属地主麦子。群众怕伪属地主报告，都不起劲。干部知道群众是想要不敢要，便亲自动手把田庄恶霸地主张茂德的一千五百斤麦子没收。接着就动员了一个老头和一个老太婆拿着布袋去领粮食。他们在街上过了一趟，鼓起了其他群众的勇气，便三三两两跟着去，共到了四十多人，很快的把麦子分完。第二天又斗争地主张本根，昨天分粮的群众便成了今天带头的积极分子。地上拾麦的和近村群众都争先恐后的参加了斗争。共清查麦子两万四千多斤和浮财一部，分给了十四个村的群众。群众兴奋万分，彼此相告：“这可饿不着了！”
