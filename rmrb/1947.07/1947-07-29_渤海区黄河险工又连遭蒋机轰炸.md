At 7:00 AM, four more planes came and strafed the area from Yuhuangtang, 20 li southeast of Putai city, to Batan Village along the river for an hour, dropping 40 bombs. More than 20 bombs were dropped on Putai City, destroying more than 30 civilian houses, killing and injuring seven residents. Losses in other villages were also heavy.

Earthwork has been 90% completed, and the preparation and transportation of bricks, stones, and straw have been 70% completed. The Wangjiazhuang dangerous section in Lijin needs over 210,000 cubic meters of earth and over 104,000 workdays, and will soon be completed.

The Huimin section has a long shoreline and many dangerous points, and additional revetments are still needed. The remaining Binxian, Gaoyuan, Qingcheng, and other sections are mostly completed. The 20 million bricks and stones and one million catties of straw transported from Zhanhua to Lijin are being transported day and night. The people along the river are now racing against time to repair the unfinished projects to prevent the imminent major flood.
