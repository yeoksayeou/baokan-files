　　In Memoriam Comrade Wang Keqin
　　More Broadly Launch the Wang Keqin Movement
    [Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 23rd] The People's Warrior Newspaper on the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Front, recently published an editorial entitled "In Memoriam Comrade Wang Keqin, More Broadly Launch the Wang Keqin Movement," stating: The Wang Keqin Movement, which combines bravery and technique, combat and training, has played a significant role in promoting military and political work this year. In the past half year or so, countless heroic exemplars of Wang Keqin and new Wang Keqin squads and platoons have emerged vigorously. The development of the Wang Keqin Movement has greatly advanced the military and political work of the entire army and greatly improved the combat effectiveness of the entire army. The editorial pointed out Comrade Wang Keqin's noble qualities, stating: He was liberated from the Kuomintang army, and after going through the class consciousness movement (speaking bitterness movement) and seeing the people in the liberated areas turn over a new leaf, he quickly realized that he must fight to the end for the people, and accepted the glorious traditions of the People's Army. He was very concerned about the lives of the soldiers, good at leading new soldiers in combat, good at uniting the masses, and deeply aware that the People's Liberation Army is the sons and brothers of the people. As the Liberation Daily editorial stated: Comrade Wang Keqin "created a new glorious example for the cause of the Chinese people's liberation." Comrade Wang Keqin himself did not become proud or complacent because of this. Until he shed his last drop of blood, he had only one thing in mind: "Unite the troops well and help each other, fight Chiang Kai-shek well, and serve the people." The editorial concluded with a call: "Today, as we mourn Comrade Wang Keqin, we must learn from his infinite loyalty to the revolutionary cause, his love for the people and comrades, and his hatred for the Chiang bandits. We must continue to deeply develop the Wang Keqin Movement, the 'remember well and learn well' movement, and the meritorious service movement in the counter-offensive, and bring forth more outstanding heroic models like Comrade Wang Keqin, continue to fight great victories, until we annihilate all invading troops!"

  　更广泛的开展王克勤运动
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线二十三日电】冀鲁豫前线人民战士报，顷以“追悼王克勤同志更广泛的开展王克勤运动”为题，发表社论称：勇敢与技术结合，作战与训练结合之王克勤运动，在今年军事政治工作上所起的推动作用甚大。大半年来，已有无数的王克勤典型的英雄和新的王克勤班、王克勤排，蓬勃的涌现出来。由于王克勤运动的开展，给全军军事政治工作上大大的推进了一步，给全军的战斗力大大的提高了一步，社论指出王克勤同志的高尚品质称：他从蒋军解放过来，经过阶级自觉运动（诉苦运动）和看到解放区人民翻身之后，迅速觉悟到要为人民奋斗到底，并接受了人民军队光荣传统。他非常关心战士生活，善于带领新战士作战，善于团结群众，深深知道人民解放军是人民的子弟。正如解放日报社论所提出的：王克勤同志“为中国人民解放事业创造了新的光荣的范例”。王克勤同志个人并不以此而骄傲自满，他直到流了最后一滴血，心目中只有一个“把部队团结互助好，好好打蒋介石，为人民服务。”该社论最后号召：“我们今天追悼王克勤同志，要学习他对革命事业的无限忠诚，对人民和同志的热爱，和对于蒋贼的憎恨。我们要在反攻中继续深入的展开王克勤运动、记好学好运动和立功运动，涌现出更多的象王克勤同志这样出色的英雄模范，继续打大胜仗，直到歼灭一切进犯军！
