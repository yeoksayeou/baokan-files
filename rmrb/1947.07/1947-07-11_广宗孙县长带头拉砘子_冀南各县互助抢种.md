    [This newspaper, Jinnan, 9th dispatch] After rain on the 23rd of last month in Guangzong, more than 30 cadres in the first district immediately stopped all unnecessary work and went to the countryside in the rain to lead the masses in rush planting, emphasizing: (1) Labor exchange between people and livestock, unified use of strength, total mobilization of men and women, not leaving a single person idle. (2) Plow all the unplowed cultivated land before planting, giving priority to families of martyrs and soldiers before planting their own land. (3) The entire district organized 3,125 livestock and 21,982 men and women. County Head Sun personally took the lead in pulling harrows, seed drills, and stone rollers. Young women and elderly farmers all joined in the rush planting campaign, completely eliminating bare land and land with missing seedlings within two days. 9,521 mu of "hard-to-plant land" were planted, 16,952 mu of cultivated land were planted, and 65,737 mu of land were replanted with seedlings. After the rain, Gao Chuntang, the village head of Gaojiazhuang Village in the fifth district, organized all the manpower and livestock in the village, divided them into three teams, and helped each other with rush planting. It was decided that livestock would plow the land, young adults would pull seed drills, older children and the elderly would help pull seed drills, younger children and female students would be responsible for delivering seeds, and women would cook, feed livestock, and grind grain at home. The village was bustling with activity, and more than 900 mu of barren land were rush-planted within three days. Widow Wang Aishu said, "In the past few years, I had to beg and plead with relatives and friends to ask for livestock and hire labor, and I still had to plant after others. This year, I am ahead of them. The world has really changed." Most of the masses experienced the benefits of mutual assistance. Cheng Zhiwen said, "If it weren't for this kind of mutual assistance, I wouldn't have been able to get to the land in time." Rui Ting said, "My land has never been plowed so well. This time, the mutual assistance in plowing made it deep and fine. My land has really had a birthday." Wang Yanxu said, "If it weren't for mutual assistance, my little ox wouldn't have been able to plow my dozen or so mu of land."

    [This newspaper, Jinnan, 9th dispatch] Shen County, Yuanchao, Wuxun, and Zaoqiang launched a rush planting campaign after the rain. Due to the large-scale organization of women and children, the rush planting task was completed ahead of schedule. Since the rain on May 13th, the women's organization in × Village, Fourth District of Shen County, organized 18 grinding teams, while the male laborers rushed to plant. After five days of concentrated effort, each team planted 2 qing of sweet potatoes, 5 qing of soybeans, and 6 qing of corn and millet. Early millet, sorghum, peanuts, and cotton were all weeded. During the rush planting in Shenzhuang, women's militia captain Wang Moying and Sisters' League leader Qin Fengzhi organized women, militia, and female students into six grinding teams, proposing to ensure that the entire village would not use animal power to grind wheat. As a result, 210 labor days of livestock were saved, and 5 qing of autumn seedlings were planted four days ahead of schedule. In the Hucun Sub-district of the Fourth District of Yuanchao, because men, women, and children all participated, the entire sub-district rush-planted 2,920 mu of peanuts within ten days. Twenty-four women from the Qianhou Yang Village participated in weeding. In Xingzhuang, Wuxun, 23 young adults and 15 women and children were divided into five groups. Adults dug holes, children planted seedlings, and women covered the roots with soil. They planted 31 mu of yams in one and a half days. The Fifth District of Zaoqiang called for the total mobilization of manpower and livestock, implemented large-scale mutual assistance, and used human-pulled seed drills to solve the shortage of draft cattle. In some villages with few draft cattle, three to five men and women organized seed drill pulling teams. After five days of concentrated effort, 30 villages completed the rush planting task of more than 27,000 mu. With the same spirit, the Eighth District implemented the total mobilization of men and women throughout the district and planted more than 60,000 mu in seven days.
