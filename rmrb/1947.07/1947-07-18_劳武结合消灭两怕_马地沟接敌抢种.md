    Combine Labor and Military Affairs to Eliminate Two Fears
    Seize the Time to Plant in Madi Gully While Facing the Enemy
    [This dispatch from Jiaozuo] On the 3rd of this month, after a thorough rain, the masses in Madi Gully returned to the village to plant crops. Initially, there were two fears in the minds of the masses: First, they feared that the village was close to the enemy's stronghold (six and a half *li*), and the enemy often came out to harass, making it impossible to harvest what was planted. They wanted to wait until Jiaozuo and Lifeng were captured before planting. Second, they feared that daily relocation would make it difficult to till the wasteland, and they were afraid of paying wages and public grain. In light of this situation, everyone discussed and realized that: First, even after Jiaozuo and Lifeng are captured, people still need to eat grain. For long-term planning, if we don't plant this summer, we won't be able to harvest in the fall, and there will be nothing to eat by next year. Second, "We have to pay public grain whether we plant or not. Planting is always better than not planting." After resolving the ideological problems, the masses requested that everyone work together and calculate labor. The whole village had twenty-seven men, excluding those who joined the army or worked elsewhere, and thirty-nine women. The whole village, excluding thirty-four people without labor, organized twenty men and twelve women, equivalent to twenty-eight point eight units of labor, divided into two mutual aid groups, and began summer planting under the cover of five militiamen. The children were in charge of carrying water, collecting firewood, scattering seeds, and delivering messages. Li Shimei and Lu Yueying, two women, cooked three meals a day for the two mutual aid groups, never being late. The whole village worked on a piece of land, cooked in one pot, relocated together, and was protected by the militia. This mixed-gender production combat team, under the constant harassment of the enemy, planted more than 150 *mu* in five days, more than double the original plan. During the planting process, the masses' thinking changed again. They were afraid that they would not be able to weed if they planted too much. So they promptly started calculating. At the slowest pace, three workdays can weed one *mu*. One hundred and fifty *mu* weeded twice a year would cost nine hundred workdays. Thirty-three days would be enough to weed well. There are at least sixty days in the season when seedlings can be weeded, which leaves twenty-seven days to spare. After everyone cleared the accounts, they decided to rush to plant the remaining forty *mu* as quickly and thoroughly as possible, leaving no wasteland, and planting twenty *mu* more than last year.

    劳武结合消灭两怕
    马地沟接敌抢种
    【本报焦作讯】本月三日落了透雨，马地沟群众回村种地，开始群众思想上存在两怕：一怕村子离敌人据点近（六里半），敌人常出扰乱，种上收不成，想等着打下焦作李封后再种。二怕每天转移，荒地锄不好，怕出工资，怕出公粮。根据这样情况，大家讨论，认识了：一，打下焦作李封也得吃粮食，长期打算，今夏种不上，秋天不能收，到明年没啥吃。二，“不种也得出公粮，种上总比不种强。”解决了思想问题，群众就要求大家一伙干，计算劳力，全村男人除参军和出外工作者外，还有二十七个，全村女人三十九个。全村除三十四个无劳力外，组织起了二十个男人，十二个女人，折合计算二十八点八个劳力，分成两个互助组，在五个民兵掩护下，开始夏种。小孩们管担水打柴丢籽送信，李士梅、卢月英两个妇女，一天三顿作着两个互助组的饭，从没误时，全村在一块地作活，一锅作饭，一齐转移，民兵掩护，这一支男女混合的生产战斗队，在敌人不断的出扰下，五天下种了一百五十多亩，超过原计划一倍。在下种中群众思想上又起了变化，怕种的多了锄不出来，当抓紧进行算帐，最慢三工可锄一亩，百五十亩全年锄两遍费九百工，三十三天足可以锄完锄好，能锄苗的季节最少有六十天，一算又空出二十七天的时间来。大家算清了帐，要把留下的四十亩赶住劲突击种完种净，不留一点荒地，比去年还多种了二十亩。（王汝珍）
