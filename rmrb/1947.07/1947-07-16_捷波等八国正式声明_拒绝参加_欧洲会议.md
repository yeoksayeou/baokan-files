    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: Reports from various sources: Regarding the "European Economic Recovery Conference" separately invited by Britain and France to twenty-two European countries to be held in Paris today, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, and Finland have formally declared their refusal to attend. In their respective replies to Britain and France, each country pointed out that the conference convened by Britain and France and the European Economic Recovery Plan would not only be unhelpful to the economic recovery of various countries, but would also be detrimental to their economic independence. Only fourteen countries, including the Netherlands and Belgium, have indicated their willingness to participate in the conference, and among them, several countries, including Switzerland, only agreed to attend after being threatened by Britain and France.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: TASS, Paris, 10th: All the preparations for the Paris "European Conference" scheduled to open on July 12th prove that there is indeed a certain decided Anglo-French plan made following Washington's orders. Now the issue is clear, the purpose of the plan is to use the "European Conference" to establish a Western bloc and make it an instrument for implementing the policies of certain American groups, who are trying to place Europe under their control by means of ambiguous credit loan promises. Bevin is stained with the anti-Soviet animosity of the Churchill ilk. With this purpose, Bevin came to Paris on June 17th and, taking advantage of the trip, pulled Bidault into his scheme to establish a Western bloc. The only reason he needed the three foreign ministers to meet in Paris was to avoid reaching an agreement with the Soviet Union. Returning to London after the meeting, he told a gullible audience: no one desires European unity more than he does. The Volunteer Newspaper said: The content and anti-Soviet nature of this speech can only be compared to Churchill's speeches. Bevin and Bidault needed these to ensure that the July 12th conference would have a clear anti-Soviet atmosphere from the start. The organizers of the Western bloc are also doing everything possible to include Western Germany. Before the Second World War, Anglo-French politicians, haunted by the Munich specter, sought to use Germany in their plans, but the whole thing ended in failure. Now they are trying to revive Munich, and thus have determined the task of at least pulling Western Germany into the Western bloc, making it an instrument for exacerbating contradictions between European countries. A few days ago, two American ministers arrived in Germany—Harriman and Anderson—and they are conducting special negotiations with former Hitlerite German officials, allowing them to reconsider increasing the level of German industry. This selfish plan by a single bloc of countries to utilize Western Germany's interests, undermining the interests of Germany as a unified and democratic nation, has been met with negative reactions from the democratic people of Germany.

    捷波等八国正式声明
    拒绝参加“欧洲会议”
    【新华社陕北十二日电】各方讯：对于英法单独邀请欧洲二十二国于今日在巴黎召开之“欧洲经济复兴会议”，捷克、波兰、南斯拉夫、匈牙利、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚及芬兰等八国，业已正式声明拒绝出席。各国在其各别送致英法之复文中，均指出英法召开之会议及欧洲经济复兴计划，不仅无益于各国经济之复兴，而且将有害于各国之经济独立。表示参加该会者，仅荷、比等十四国，其中尚有瑞士等数国系受英法方面之威胁后始应允出席。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】塔斯社巴黎十日电：定于七月十二日开幕的巴黎“欧洲会议”的一切准备工作证明，确有某种已决定的、遵循华盛顿的命令而作出的英法计划存在。现在问题已明显，该计划的目的乃在利用“欧洲会议”以建立西方集团，并使其成为实行某些美国集团之政策的工具，他们力图借暧昧的信用贷款诺言将欧洲置于其控制之下。贝文是染满了邱吉尔之流的对苏仇视。怀着这种目的，贝文在六月十七日来巴黎，并乘旅行之便，将皮道尔拉入他的建立西方集团的策划中。他需要三外长在巴黎开会，唯一的目的是不与苏联协议。会后返伦敦时，他向易受欺骗的听众说：没有人比他更愿望欧洲的团结。义勇军报说：这篇演说的内容与反苏性质，只有邱吉尔的演说才能相比。贝文与皮道尔需要这些，以使十二日的会议在一开始就有明确的仇苏空气。西方集团的组织者又竭尽所能将西部德国包括在内。第二次世界大战前，怀着慕尼黑幽灵的英法政治家们，曾力求在他们的计划中利用德国，结果全盘归于失败。如今又企图使慕尼黑复活，因而便确定了这样的任务：至少将西部德国拉入西方集团，使其成为加剧欧洲各国间矛盾的工具。数日前，有二个美国公使到德国——哈里曼与安德逊，他们正与前希特勒德国的官吏进行特殊的谈判，允许他们再考虑增加德国工业水平。此种唯一集团国家的利益利用西部德国的自私计划，破坏作为一个统一民主国家的德国的利益，在德国的民主人民方面所得到的反应都是否定的。
