[From our Ping Shun correspondent] The family of labor hero Li Shunda is a well-known model family, but recently the whole family has been disorganized and in low spirits. Shunda's mother, Guo Yuzhi, said, "The affairs of this family are not as peaceful as in the past when we were poor. I don't want to stay at home anymore. I want to find a place to teach weaving as a teacher." Shunda's wife, Lü Guilan, was also unhappy. When Shunda asked her to make shoes, she said, "What's the use of doing that?" When asked to sew clothes, she said there was no cloth. On the surface, everyone was doing what they were supposed to do, but inwardly they had their own thoughts. When Shuntong discovered this situation, he immediately conducted individual talks to help them clear their minds. On June 17th, he convened a family meeting to find out what was on their minds. Guo Yuzhi said, "My main concern is that after the county's summary of the Hundred-Day Spinning and Weaving campaign, I felt that I couldn't achieve anything at home. I wanted to set up a textile factory, and only by teaching more apprentices could I become a hero. That's why I personally found a place and mobilized five apprentices to weave cloth." Lü Guilan said, "I didn't complete my plan in the Hundred-Day Spinning and Weaving campaign either, and I felt it wasn't glorious. Our family has a large population, and I can barely manage to cook. If I split my time, I can't manage to spin, and we can't get cloth to wear. I'm doing a thankless job, being an old affairs officer for life without any fame or benefit." Shunda also said, "Now there's a disaster again, and you are all fighting and not working together. I also feel that no one is interested in being frugal and planning. Our family is not going to do well. Our carpenter's salary is three shi of rice, the stonemason's is four shi, and hiring workers will cost seven shi, for a total of fourteen shi of rice. The sheep weren't taken care of and thirty died. What we harvest in the fall won't be enough to pay people. Besides, even if I'm a hero, it's not good. Because of family matters, my work is also not going well, and I won't be able to be a hero this year." Shunda also researched these situations and concluded that the main reason was that they didn't hold meetings regularly, didn't discuss, didn't research, and didn't keep accounts. Therefore, combined with the preparations for the famine, they began to calculate their family assets and make plans. Everyone calculated that they were still doing well, and still had a lot of surplus. After the accounts were settled, they made specific plans to sell cloth, transport goods, and produce a total of sixteen shi and one dou of millet, corn, and wheat. Gathering 400 jin of wild vegetables, eating half bran and half vegetables, and saving two liang of rice a day would be enough to eat for five months. By reclaiming wasteland and planting vegetables, the disaster and difficulties could be solved. The whole family's morale immediately soared, and they set up a system of equal exchange and specific division of labor according to labor. Guilan was responsible for cooking and operating the millstone. Yuzhi was in charge of leading the spinning and weaving, the hired worker Zhang Maihai led agriculture, Song Yuanren was responsible for transportation, and Shunda took care of the overall leadership of the whole village. Everyone had no objections to this division of labor, unified cooperation, and on this basis, they democratically discussed and set the whole family's standards for meritorious service. After the meeting, everyone helped each other and worked hard to strive for meritorious service. On June 21st, at the village meeting, Li Shunda explained in detail how he convened a family meeting, cleared his mind to resolve conflicts, carefully calculated his family assets, made plans, and mobilized the whole family to produce and prepare for the famine. Everyone agreed that it was necessary to hold family meetings and keep detailed accounts in order to have a clear understanding. It is often said that eating doesn't make you poor, wearing doesn't make you poor, but lack of planning makes you poor right now. So everyone went back to their homes, held meetings, kept accounts, and made production and savings plans.

　　李顺达开家庭会
    解圪?齐心节约
    【本报平顺讯】劳动英雄李顺达的家庭是有名的模范家庭，但近来全家东扭西歪情绪低落。顺达母郭玉支说：“现在这家里的事不如过去的穷光景清净，我也不想在家啦，要找个地方教织布当老师。”顺达妻吕贵兰也不高兴，顺达叫做鞋，她说：“顾上干啥么”，叫缝衣服说没布。表面上大家该干啥干啥，内里却互有心思。顺通发现这情况后，即刻进行个别谈话，帮助打通思想。于六月十七日召开全家会议访心思。郭玉支说：“我主要是在县总结百日纺织后，感觉一直在家弄不出个所以来，就一心想搞一个纺织厂，多教几个徒弟才能当个英雄，因此才亲自找了个地方动员了五个学徒织布。”吕贵兰说：“在百日纺织中我也没完成计划，感到不光荣，咱家里人口大，光清净做饭还顾不上哩，花分开了，也顾不上纺，穿不上布，我这是出力不讨好，当一辈子老事务长没名没利的”。顺达也说：“现在又是灾荒，你们互相圪扭不一心，我也感觉谁都没心思俭省打算，咱这家是过不好了，咱短木匠工资米三石，石匠四石，雇工下来也得七石，共得工资米十四石。羊也没放好死了三十多，到秋天打下来还不够给人家的。再说我当个英雄倒好吧，这样因家庭工作也搞不好，今年英雄也当不成了。”顺达并根据这些情况研究出主要是没经常开会，没讨论没研究没算帐形成的。于是结合了备荒开始算家当订出计划。大家一算，还是好过的光景，还是有不少富余，帐算好即订出具体计划，卖布运输各项生产共合米玉茭、麦子，十六石一斗。采野菜四百斤，糠菜对半吃，一天省二两米，够吃五个月，并开荒种菜，灾荒困难就能解决。全家情绪立刻高涨，订出等价交换，按劳力具体分工的办法。贵兰负责做饭推碾磨。玉支专领导纺织，雇工张买孩领导农业，宋远仁负责运输，顺达照顾全面领导全村。这样分工负责统一合作大家都没意见，并在这个基础上民主讨论订出全家立功标准，会后大家互相帮助一股劲的争取立功。六月二十一日，李顺达在全村大会上把自己怎样召开家庭会，打通思想解圪＠，细算家当订计划，全家动手，生产备荒的情况详细讲给大家听。大家一致认为要这样开家庭会细算帐才会有底。常说吃不穷穿不穷，打算不到当下穷。于是个个回到家里，都开会算帐订生产节约计划。（双红、王考）
