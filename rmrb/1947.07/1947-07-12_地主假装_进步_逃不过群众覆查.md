Landlord Feigns "Progress"
    Escapes Mass Re-examination
[Our newspaper's JiluYu dispatch on the 10th] Wang Yu Feng of Tongcheng Town, Dong'a County, was a unique tyrant in Tongcheng East Gate. No matter who had a wedding or funeral, they had to ask him to preside over it. He employed three long-term laborers and ran a money shop. He was truly imposing and arrogant. When the land reform began, he still had more than 40 mu of land, no longer employed workers, and stopped doing business. On the surface, he no longer seemed like much of a landlord. As soon as he heard about the struggle sessions, he ran to the village office, eagerly helping the masses write booklets and calculate accounts, talking about serving the masses with a whole set of "progressive" words. Therefore, many people said he was "progressive" and elected him as a land distribution representative. At the end of the land reform, he became a model worker. He was the first "land-dedicating household" in Dongguan. No one raised any objections during the struggle session, and he offered the least amount of things. After the re-examination movement was launched in the villages, the village cadres wanted to investigate him, and the masses also mobilized. When they went to his house, they found that everything was gone, and they were discouraged. The village cadres were anxiously pacing around. Everyone tied up his whole family, but he did not admit to having anything. While questioning him, someone suddenly jumped up and reported that they had found a large pickle jar and a lot of grain and clothing in the house of Wang Ping, a member of the farmers' association. The masses' emotions rose, and they shouted, "Things are hidden in the rat's nest. We must search the rat's nest!" Immediately, they questioned him and called on the masses to report themselves. As a result, they found that a total of twelve families were hiding things for him, worth more than 2 million yuan. After the deceived masses handed over the things, they said, "At that time, I asked you if you were afraid of the struggle session, and you said mysteriously, 'Don't you know I have become an activist? Who would struggle against me?'" In addition, everyone revealed that Wang Yu Feng falsely claimed to be distributing public grain and asked people to store grain for him. He used sweet words such as lending grain to people to eat and asking people to do business to get people to store grain for him. Someone else said, "The troublemaking of targeting rich peasants Guan Changjian and Fu Langzheng in the initial struggle was also Wang Yu Feng's doing." Then, they dug up half a hand grenade (with more than 70 pieces) from underground. The masses all said, "We were deceived by the landlord in the past. From now on, we must unite and resolutely and thoroughly carry out the re-examination."

    地主假装“进步”
    逃不过群众覆查
    【本报冀鲁豫十日电】东阿铜城镇王玉奉是铜城东关数一无二的霸王，不论谁家婚丧大事，都得请他主事，他雇用三个长工，开着钱庄，真是威风凛凛，不可一世。土地改革开始，他还有四十多亩地，雇工也不用了，买卖也不作了，从表面看已不算什么地主。他一听说要斗争，便先向村公所里跑，争着帮助群众写册子算帐，谈起来就是为群众服务一大套“进步”话，因此好些人都说他“进步”，选他当了分地代表，土地改革结束时，他又当了工作模范，他是东关里第一个“献地户”，开斗争会时没人提意见，拿出了最少的一点东西。覆查运动在各村掀起之后，村干部要查他，群众也动起来了，走到他家一看，什么东西都没有了，泄了气。村干急的转圈，大家把他全家捆起来，但他不承认有东西。正追问中，忽然有人跳起来报告，在农会委员王平家找出一个大酱菜缸，还有很多粮食、衣裳，群众情绪高涨起来了，高喊着：“东西藏到老鼠窝里，要查老鼠窝”。当即一面追问，一面号召群众自报。结果查出共十二家给他藏东西，价值二百多万元。受骗的群众献出东西之后说：“当时我问你是不是怕斗争，你怪神气的说：你不知道我当了积极分子，还会斗我”？…………此外大家还揭发出王玉奉假借分藏公粮为名，要人家给他放粮食，他借给人家吃，要人家做买卖等花言巧语叫人家给他存粮食。还有人说：“当初斗争中农关长俭、傅朗钲也是王玉奉捣的鬼。”接着又从地下起出他半个手榴弹（有七十多个）。群众都说：“过去上了地主的当，今后要团结起来，坚决彻底进行覆查”。
