　　[Taiyue Dispatch, this newspaper, 2nd] In the new liberated areas of southern Shanxi, land reform has begun by addressing the people's urgent demands and launching a struggle against "compilation villages." Since mid-June, cadres in the pilot villages of the second district of Wenxi County have been helping the masses harvest wheat, dispelling their doubts and establishing contact. The flames of grievance and revenge have spread to all villages. An old man named Xiangyun from Liu Village, a pilot village in Yu, who was subjected to reverse accounting last year, said, "This year, I will risk my life to avenge myself." An old woman from Xishan Village, a pilot village, said, "Because I couldn't afford the burden, the oil mill owner (head of the 'compilation village') demolished my house. Now, I must make him rebuild it for me." Eighteen natural villages, including Shand, Guandi, Qiaosi, Dai Village, Yukou, and Hou Village, are also in the midst of grievance and revenge. Xishan Village has made the fastest breakthrough. Farmers quickly organized their own peasant associations and first struggled against Tan Yiming and other ringleaders of reverse accounting, recovering 199 mu of land and a large number of houses and farm tools. Xue Shijie, the "compilation village" chief of Sanhan Village in Ruicheng County, extorted most of the farmers' land during the Japanese occupation. After the Japanese surrender, he relied on the Yan rebel and continued to extort. No matter who raised livestock, he would ride it as soon as he went out. The farmers hated him deeply. Now, more than 200 farmers have organized to fight him, and 324 mu of Xue's land has been distributed to landless and land-poor farmers. At the end of May, the county town was reoccupied by the enemy. The stubborn puppets' "compilation villages" and a few secret agents actively continued to demand laborers, conscript manpower, and collect grain from the masses in the vicinity of the city. The people were all worried and said, "The oil mill is here again. It's hard for us to stand up." In order to relieve the people's suffering, our democratic government immediately sent armed forces and work teams to the countryside to lead the masses to refuse to maintain the situation, and arrested Cheng Junyan and a deputy platoon leader, the new "compilation village" chiefs appointed by the Yan rebel in Xiwang Village, giving the reactionary forces an effective suppression and helping the masses to turn over.

　　晋南新区满足群众迫切要求
  　普遍开展反“编村”斗争
    【本报太岳二日电】晋南新解放区土地改革，从解决群众迫切要求入手，展开反“编村”斗争。闻喜二区自六月上旬各基点村干部帮助群众割麦，打破群众疑虑，取得联系以后，诉苦复仇烽火已遍燃各村。峪基点刘家村去年被倒算的祥云老汉说：“今年拚上命也得报了仇”。西山底基点一位老太太说：“因为我出不起负担，油房掌柜（编村长）便将我的房子拆了，现在我非要他给我盖起不行。”山底、观底、乔寺、袋村、峪口、侯村等十八个自然村也正在诉苦复仇中。西山底突破得最快，农民迅速组织起自己的农会，首先斗争倒算头子谭一明等，收回土地一百九十九亩，房子及农具甚多。芮城三罕村阎顽编村村长薛世杰曾在日寇统治时讹诈了农民大部土地，日寇投降后又依附阎逆，继续敲诈，不管是谁养的牲口，只要他一出门就得给他骑上，农民恨之切齿，现已有二百余农民组织起来与他斗争，已将薛逆之土地三百二十四亩分配给无地少地农民。县城于五月底重陷敌手，顽伪“编村”及少数特务便积极在城周附近，继续向群众要夫、拉丁、征粮，老百姓都愁苦的说：“油坊又来了，咱们又难站。”我民主政府为解除民众痛苦，即派武装及工作组分头下乡领导群众拒绝维持，并抓回西王村阎逆新派之“编村”村长程俊彦及中队副各一名，给反动势力以有效镇压，援助群众翻身。
