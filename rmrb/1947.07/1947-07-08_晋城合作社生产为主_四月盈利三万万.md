　　Taiyue, July 6th (from our newspaper) - The cooperative movement in Jincheng County is developing rapidly. In four and a half months, profits from organization and transportation exceeded 309 million yuan. The County Cooperative Alliance summarized these achievements and experiences, stating that since the rectification of cooperatives and the shift in business direction began in August of last year, up to the end of May this spring, a total of 653 cooperatives have been organized, with 56,442 male and female members and over 100 million yuan in member shares. The main business activities include textiles, transportation, iron smelting, coal mining, oil pressing, and dyeing. Only 18 cooperatives are solely engaged in consumer business, accounting for 2% of the total. The shift in business operations has resulted in significant profits, not only from their own operations but also from organizing mass production.

　　In textiles: The number of women spinners in the county has grown to 32,242, and the number of women weavers to 3,937. They have woven a total of 1,716,000 feet of cloth, earning over 100 million yuan.

　　In transportation: According to incomplete statistics, over 1,000 laborers and 1,370 livestock have participated, earning a total of 80,295,000 yuan in three and a half months.

　　In saltpeter boiling: To supply raw materials for military needs, under the unified leadership of the County Cooperative Alliance, over 300 saltpeter boilers were organized, producing a total of 124,400 catties of saltpeter and earning a total of 43,473,300 yuan.

　　The above four types of production have earned a total of 309,697,280 yuan. The summary points out that the main reasons for achieving these results are: the good combination of war support and production, which allowed for the extraction of surplus labor to participate in sideline production. There are two forms of integrating sideline occupations: one is to squeeze in transportation during busy periods, and the other is to mobilize everyone to go to the fields together, completing agriculture and then engaging in sideline occupations. Under the principle of prioritizing agriculture and not delaying agricultural seasons, opportunities are seized to carry out textile production. For example, Shangcheng Township was assigned a burden of 190,000 yuan and 70 pairs of military shoes. They mobilized women to spin and weave to solve this problem. Within half a month, 213 women spinners spun 320 catties of yarn and wove 128 bolts of cloth, earning 400,000 yuan. After paying off the above two items, they still had 25,000 yuan left. Jinjiang Township used the money earned from transportation to buy 70 more livestock, Caiyuan Township used transportation to buy 12 more livestock, and Nancun Township bought 15 more.

　　晋城合作社生产为主
  　四月盈利三万万
    【本报太岳六日电】晋城合作事业迅速发展，四个半月组织运输等盈利三万万九千余万元。县联社总结这一段成绩和经验称：自去年八月开始整顿合作与转变业务方针以来，截止今春五月底止，共组织合作社六五三个，男女社员五六四四二人，社员股金一万万余元，业务内容主要包括纺织、运输、铁炉、煤窑、油坊、染坊等。单纯经营消费业务者只十八个，占总数百分之二。业务转变后获利很大，不仅经营自己业务获利很大，而且组织群众生产赚钱更多。在纺织方面：全县纺妇发展到三万二千二百四十二名，织妇三千九百三十七名，共织布一百七十一万六千余尺，赚洋一万万余元。在运输方面：据不完全统计，共参加劳力千余名，牲畜一千三百七十头，三个半月共赚洋八千二十九万五千余元。熬硝方面：为供应军需原料，在县联社统一领导下，共组织起硝锅三百余座，共熬火硝十二万四千余斤，共赚洋四千三百四十七万三千余元。以上四种业务生产，共赚洋三万万九千六百九十七万二千八百元。在总结中指出获得这些成绩的主要原因是：战勤与生产结合得好，得以抽出剩余劳力参加副业生产。在结合副业方面，有两种形式，一种是忙里抽间去运输，一种是全体总动员一齐下地，作完农业再搞副业。在以农业为主与不误农时的方针下，抓紧时机进行纺织生产，如上城公派下负担十九万元，军鞋七十双，他们以动员妇女纺织来解决，半个月内二一三名纺妇纺线三二○斤，织布一二八匹，赚洋四十万元，除了交完以上两宗款外，还余两万五千元。金匠由运输赚洋增买牲口七十头，菜园由运输增买牲口十二头，南村增买十五头。
