Even After the Rain, We Must Be Thrifty
    Mazhuang Continues to Gather Wild Vegetables

    [This newspaper] News: After the key point of Shanglian in the third district of Tunliu County finished crash planting, there was a general rain, but the villages did not let the rain affect their efforts to be thrifty and prepare for famine. The masses and cadres in villages such as Mazhuang and Hejialing continued to implement the spirit of being thrifty and preparing for famine, and further led the masses to launch the "two-he-mi" movement (saving two "he" of rice per person per day). Under the leadership of labor hero Zhai Baize, the entire village of Mazhuang, young and old, was involved in the movement to conserve and prepare for famine. After studying the methods in mutual aid teams, each household earnestly implemented them. They eat *geda* (dough drops) in the morning, mixing three *sheng* of bran into each *dou* of cornmeal. They don't buy vegetables to eat with their meals. They eat thick porridge at noon, and drink rice soup at night. Except for urgent matters, they never light lamps at night. In this way, one person can save two *he* of rice per day, and the whole village of forty-six people can save a total of nine *sheng* and seven *he* of rice per day.

    下了雨还要节约
    马庄继续采野菜
    【本报讯】屯留三区上连基点，在突击补种后，又普遍落雨，但各村并不因为落雨而影响节约备荒。马庄、贺家岭等村群众干部，仍然贯彻着节约备荒的精神，更进一步领导群众展开了二合米运动。马庄在劳英斋豹则的领导下，全村老幼都卷入节约备荒的运动。他们在互助组里研究出办法后，各家认真实行起来。早上吃疙瘩，玉茭面每斗掺上三升糠，吃饭不买菜，晌午吃稠饭，黑夜喝米汤。除有紧要事情外，黑夜决不点灯。这样一天一个人能省二合米，全庄四十六个人一天共省九升七合米。
