　　Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Observer Denounces Traitor Chiang Kai-shek
　　Daring to "Arrest" the Leader of the Chinese People
　　The Chinese People Have Reason to Arrest Chiang Kai-shek and Try Him for His Crimes
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd – The Kuomintang Central News Agency’s Nanjing dispatch of June 29th announced that the Nanjing Chiang Kai-shek government had issued a so-called "arrest warrant" for Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people and the leader of the Chinese Communist Party. Chiang Kai-shek took this step precisely when the people of the whole country were rising up to demand peace and oppose the civil war. Only a month ago, Chiang Kai-shek's Political Participation Council sent a telegram requesting the CCP representatives to go to Nanjing to resume peace talks, and Chiang Kai-shek also declared that "the country absolutely needs peace," etc. At that time, knowledgeable public opinion had already asserted that this posture was completely deceptive. Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "arrest warrant" seems particularly ridiculous amidst the victorious counter-offensive of the People's Liberation Army. Observers here believe that at a time when Chiang's army is failing everywhere and the economic and political crises are becoming increasingly serious, Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary move is an attempt to salvage the widespread despair among Chiang's military officers and Kuomintang officials, and is another futile attempt. Another motive for this move is an immediate response to the 130 million bullets donated by the US State Department. The observer said that since Chiang Kai-shek has "arrested" the leaders of the CCP, any liberated area government and any Chinese has more reason to arrest Chiang Kai-shek and try him for his crimes. The Chinese people’s second capture of the traitor, murderer, and instigator of the civil war, Chiang Kai-shek, after the Xi'an Incident is becoming increasingly realistic. The observer said that over the past year, Chiang Kai-shek has taken many steps, convening the "National Assembly," formulating a "constitution," "reorganizing" the government, expelling CCP representatives, and occupying Yan'an. Now, he has taken the so-called "arrest" of CCP leaders, the purpose of which is to strike at the prestige of the CCP and all democratic forces, and isolate them. But the result is the complete opposite, fatally undermining the little remaining prestige Chiang Kai-shek had among the people, and completely isolating himself. Chiang Kai-shek's collapse is only a matter of time.

　　陕北观察家痛斥卖国贼蒋介石
  　胆敢“通缉”中国人民领袖
    中国人民已有理由缉拿蒋介石并审判其罪行
    【新华社陕北二日电】国民党中央社六月廿九日南京电宣布南京蒋介石政府已对中国人民领袖与中国共产党领袖毛泽东实行所谓“下令通缉”。蒋介石采取此项步骤，正是在全国人民群起而要求和平、反对内战的时候。仅仅一个月以前，蒋介石的参政会还电请中共代表去南京恢复和谈，蒋介石还宣称：“国家绝对需要和平”云云，当时熟悉内幕的舆论界，即已断言这种姿态完全是欺诈。蒋介石的所谓“通缉令”，在人民解放军胜利反攻的浪潮中，特别显得滑稽。此间观察家认为：在蒋军到处失败，经济危机与政治危机日益严重的时候，蒋介石此种反动的举措，是企图挽救蒋军将士与国民党官员普遍绝望情绪，是又一穷极无聊的尝试。此项步骤的另一动机，则为对于美国国务院赠送子弹一万万三千万发的一种立时响应。该观察家称：既然蒋介石已经“通缉”中共领袖，则任何一个解放区政府和任何一个中国人就有更大理由缉拿蒋介石并审判其罪行。中国人民继西安事变以后第二次活捉卖国贼、杀人犯、内战祸首蒋介石一事，现已日益富于现实性。观察家说：一年来蒋介石采取了许多步骤，召集“国大”、制定“宪法”、“改组”政府、驱逐中共代表、占领延安，现在夕有所谓“通缉”中共领袖，其目的都是为着打击中共及一切民主力量的威信，并将他们孤立起来。但其结果却是完全相反，致命地打击了蒋介石自己在人民中残存的一点威信，并把他自己完全孤立起来。蒋介石的崩溃，只是一个时间问题了。
