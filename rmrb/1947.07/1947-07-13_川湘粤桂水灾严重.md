Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. According to news from various news agencies on the 7th: The Chengdu area has recently experienced the worst flooding in sixty years. On the 4th, torrential rain fell continuously for 24 hours, causing the Min River to swell drastically. The counties confirmed to be affected include Guanxian and 17 others. In the vicinity of Chengdu alone, over 1,000 residents along the river have drowned. Homes on both banks have been swept away, with estimated property losses reaching tens of billions. The city of Chengdu has also become a waterlogged area.

Another report: In recent days, the water level of the Yangtze River has surged sharply. On the 7th, the river water near Chongqing rose to six zhang and two chi [~20 meters], completely submerging the Coral Dam Airport. Jingzhou, Wuhan and other places reported sharp rises in river water. The flood season this year has arrived more than a month earlier than in previous years.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. According to the Chiang-controlled Central News Agency, the preliminary statistics for the losses from the Chengdu flood are as follows: 802 houses along the river were washed away, over 40 disaster areas, more than 100,000 people left homeless, and losses of at least over 10 billion. In Wangjiang Tower alone, over 100 floating corpses were recovered.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. According to Reuters on the 8th: Following floods in Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Taiwan, Hunan province has also suffered severe flooding. The flood-stricken area in Hunan province covers 13 counties, with huge grain losses, leaving one million disaster victims on the brink of starvation. According to various sources: The floods in Guangdong province have begun to recede. This flood, the worst seen in 32 years, has caused losses of approximately 300 billion to 500 billion Chiang currency and destroyed 40% of the province's spring rice crop, a reduction of approximately 300,000 to 500,000 tons (approximately 6.6 million to 11 million shi [a unit of dry measure]), sweeping through nearly 60 counties and 400 farmhouses, submerging 8 million mu [~533,000 hectares] of fertile land, and destroying 50,000 houses. According to UN relief officials, the floods in Guangxi and Hunan provinces are as severe as those in Guangdong province.
