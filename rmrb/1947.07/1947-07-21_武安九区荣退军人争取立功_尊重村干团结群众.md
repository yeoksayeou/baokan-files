　　Veteran Soldiers in the Ninth District of Wu'an Strive for Meritorious Service
　　Respecting Village Cadres and Uniting the Masses

    [This Newspaper Reports] The disputes and contradictions that had long plagued a small number of veteran soldiers in the Ninth District of Wu'an with village cadres and the masses have been fundamentally resolved due to the veterans' conscious efforts to engage in meritorious service, set examples, and conduct self-criticism and education. In the past, such conflicts were quite common. The reason for this, in addition to the parties involved in the conflicts, was that in the past, every time the leadership held meetings for honorary soldiers, they would specifically collect opinions against district and village cadres and the masses. Even when there was no problem, they would insist on raising issues, and those who raised more issues were considered activists. The result was creating problems where none existed and turning small issues into big ones. At the end of last month, when the district convened a meeting of more than eighty veteran soldiers, they completely changed this leadership method, examining the reasons, experiences, and lessons learned from the land reform last winter and this year's production, in terms of each person's relationship with cadres and the masses, and stipulated the direction and path to be taken in the future. At the meeting, Chen Daochao, a veteran soldier from Yetao, said: "What kind of turn have I made? What kind of status do I have? The cadres of Yetao always attack me, saying that I am involved with the landlord's woman this and that. I joined the revolution at the age of nine, and I don't have any merit?" Meng Nuozi, a member of the Veterans Management Committee, and Wang Jixiang from Shili Village, also said that veteran soldiers have no status in the village. Another veteran soldier, Zhang Yaosheng, immediately retorted: "As long as you are truly for the masses, the masses will support you. Not long after I returned from the military, the masses elected me as a cadre. You don't participate in the mass struggle, and sometimes you listen to the landlord's words and oppose the masses. You always complain that you get too little when distributing the fruits [of labor], and you don't take care of the masses. Some comrades are very strong, but they insist on having the masses till the land for them. Some comrades have been back for two or three years and still haven't paid public grain. If you make a suggestion, they say 'I am the elder, I am the elder.' Not to mention the masses opposing you, even I oppose you!" Wang Mingfa said to Chen Daochao: "You say you haven't turned over, but you have been given good houses and land. Wasn't the landlord Wu Shutang's mule also given to you? You are now living the life of a prosperous middle peasant. Have you seen what the masses are like? You say the cadres attack you, why don't they attack me? You say you have merit, but which one of us here doesn't have a few holes in our body? But have you done anything meritorious since you came back?" Many other veteran soldiers, such as Li Yunjiang, also said: "You still say you have no status in the village, talk about yourselves, don't talk about us!" The leadership turned the direction towards commending merit, and immediately discovered many exemplary deeds and figures in participating in mass struggles and production savings from everyone's reports, which were warmly supported by the masses. Everyone elected a merit-making committee, and automatically summarized several conditions for merit-making from the exemplary reports: (1) Actively participate in mass movements and resolutely struggle against landlords; (2) As far as possible, rely on self-reliance, and do not cause too much trouble to the village, and do not waste the people's labor and financial resources; (3) Implement policies and regulations, and set an example in supporting the army and undertaking burdens. After formal evaluation, seven people were rated as having made first-class merit, sixteen people were rated as having made second-class merit, and thirty people were rated as having made third-class merit. After the awards were given, everyone competed to set production and savings plans, and the next day, not a single person was smoking paper cigarettes. In the commendation of merit and setting of examples, everyone's awareness of their own merits was enlightened. In order to cherish their past merits and add merit to merit, even Meng Nuozi and others, who were most fond of making trouble with village cadres, also took the initiative to make self-criticisms, determined to unite with cadres and the masses in production and savings.

　　武安九区荣退军人争取立功
  　尊重村干团结群众
    【本报讯】武安九区少数荣退军人与村干部群众久久不能解决的纠纷与矛盾，已因荣退军人自觉开展立功表模与自我批评教育而获得基本解决，此种矛盾过去相当多，其原因除矛盾者双方外，领导上过去每开荣誉军人会，都是专门搜集对区村干部与群众们意见，明明没什么问题，也要硬提，提的多就算积极分子。结果是无事生事，小事变大。上月底该区召集八十多个荣退军人开会时，完全改变了此种领导方法，从去冬土地改革与今年生产中，各人与干部群众关系的好坏中检讨原因及经验教训，规定今后应采取的方向与道路。会上，冶陶荣退军人陈道朝说：“我翻了啥身啦？我有了啥地位？冶陶干部每次打击我，说我跟地主女人这啦那啦，我九岁参加革命，就没有一点功？”荣退军人管委会委员孟诺子与十里店的王吉祥等也说荣退军人在村里没有地位。另一荣退军人张耀生即反驳说：“只要你们真为群众，群众没有不拥护你们的。我退伍回来不几天，群众就选举我当了干部。你们不参加群众斗争，有时候还听上地主的话反对群众，分果实总是嫌少，不照顾群众，有的同志身体棒积积的，（很好的意思），非叫群众给自己代耕，有的同志下来过了二、三年啦，还不出公粮，提个意见就是老子长，老子短，不用说群众反对你，就是我也反对哩”！王明发对陈道朝说：“你说你没翻身，可是你分了上好房子地，吴树堂（地主）家的骡子不是也分给你啦？你现在过的富裕中农生活，你看看群众是怎个样？你说干部打击你，为啥不打击我？你说你有功，这儿在座的那个身上没几个窟窿？可是你回来以后立功没有”？其他李云江等许多荣退军人也说：“你们还说在村没地位，说你们自己，不要说俺！”领导上将方向转向表功，立即从各人报告中发现许多在参加群众斗争与生产节约中的模范事迹与人物，都获得了群众热烈拥护，大家选举了立功委员会，并从模范报告中自动归纳出几个立功条件：（一）积极参加群众运动，坚决斗争地主；（二）尽可能自力更生，不给村上多找麻烦，不浪费民力财力；（三）执行政策法令，支差与负担上起模范。经大家正式评议，评定七个人立了头等功，十六个人立了二等功，三十个人立了三等功。发奖后各人争订生产节约计划，第二天就没有一个吸纸烟的了。在立功表模中，启发了大家的功劳自觉，为了珍贵自己过去的功劳，并功上加功，连最爱和村干部闹不团结的孟诺子等也纷纷自动做了检讨，决心和干部群众团结生产节约。
