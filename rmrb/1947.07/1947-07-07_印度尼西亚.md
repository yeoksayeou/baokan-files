　　Indonesia

　　Indonesia was formerly known as the "Dutch East Indies," a name given by Dutch imperialism. What China calls the "Nanyang Islands" refers to this area. The first person to use the name "Indonesia" was an American named Logan, around 1850. This term has now become a symbol of the Indonesian national united front (abbreviated as Indonesia). The Dutch initially did not recognize this name, only formally acknowledging it in 1940. The Indonesian region includes Java, Sumatra, Borneo, Celebes (Sulawesi), and parts of the Lesser Sunda Islands and New Guinea. Its borders stretch from Sabang in Sumatra in the west to central New Guinea in the east, bordering the Philippines to the north and the Indian Ocean to the south. It comprises over two thousand islands, with an area of 743,340 square miles and a population of 72 million, mostly Muslim. Java is one of the most densely populated places in the world, producing rubber, petroleum, rice, tea, coffee, tobacco, tin, spices, sugar cane, etc. Tin production accounts for 20% of the world's total, and oil accounts for 10%.

　　The social nature of Indonesia retains or obscures aspects of various stages from primitive communist society to capitalist society. From the 7th to the 10th centuries, there was the Srivijaya kingdom (also known as Palembang), and from the 13th to the 15th centuries, the Majapahit kingdom in Java unified almost all of what is today Indonesian territory. Its feudal politics adopted Indian traditions. The colonial era began in 1509 with the eastward expansion of Portuguese power, followed by Spain, both for short periods. In 1599, the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company in Sumatra, forcibly leasing land and beginning capitalist exploitation, which continues to this day. The 600,000 Dutch acres of plantation production in Java became the source of wealth for Dutch capitalists, allowing them to earn $800 million in profits within decades. In major cities such as Batavia (Jakarta), Dutch wealth was concentrated, combined with the encroachment of British and American capital. (In terms of investment, the Netherlands ranked first, Britain second, and the United States third; in terms of commodity economy, the total value of imports and exports ranked Britain first, the United States second, and the Netherlands third.) This formed Indonesian colonial society. In rural areas, in Sumatra, fifty years ago, it was still in the era of agricultural communes; in Borneo, where the Dayak people live scattered, the agricultural commune form of large families is still maintained; in New Guinea, the Papuan and Kayin tribes still live in the hunting era.

　　The Indonesian Republic's politically directly controlled areas are Java, Sumatra, and Madura. The people of Borneo and Celebes are demanding to join (the Dutch only recognize the former, attempting to keep the latter two islands as their colonies, and using this to provoke division and undermine the independence movement). The Republic has a National Committee (equivalent to the National Assembly), with the Islamic Union holding 67 seats, the Nationalist Party 55 seats, and the Communist Party, Socialist Party, and Labor Party each holding 35 seats. President Sukarno, Vice President Hatta, Prime Minister Sjahrir (also in charge of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Internal Affairs), Defense Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Army Sudirman, Finance Minister Sunar, and other ministers of education, propaganda, transportation, etc., from the Prime Minister down to the cabinet members, are all under 50 years old, mostly intellectuals, and many have studied abroad.

　　The Indonesian independence movement has a long history. Due to the Dutch imperialist policy of division and alienation, the backwardness of the Indonesian upper-class peasants, the xenophobia of Islamic thought, and the petty bourgeoisie's unwarranted fear of the Soviet Union, the revolution has had to take a tortuous path. The Indonesian Communist Party was established in 1921, and in 1926, it united the left-wing elements of all parties (the Sarekat Islam, the Islamic League, etc.) and launched a major revolution. The Dutch suffered heavy losses but eventually suppressed it by force. In 1929, more than a thousand communists were exiled (including the leader Sardjono). In 1927, Sukarno broke away from his father-in-law's Islamic League and formed the Nationalist Party. Up to now, Sukarno has become the President of the Indonesian Republic, but within his faction, some believe that the path to developing Indonesian national capital is to first attack Chinese merchants. In addition, with the Dutch instigation, incidents of looting Chinese property and massacring Chinese occurred continuously last year. In tortuous negotiations with the Netherlands, the Indonesian Nationalist Party has often shown vacillation. Their gentlemanly views only saw the following facts: (1) The Indonesian people do not yet have sufficient autonomous power, and overstepping actions, robbery, and looting occur from time to time; (2) 100% independence for the Indonesian people is not yet the time; (3) They advocate unrestricted foreign investment and turn to cultivating Indonesian capital from commercial capital. These views and strategies basically fall into the set of Dutch imperialism's hopes. Therefore, it was not long before the Nationalist Party was torn by internal strife, and the Socialist Party and the Labor Party emerged.

　　In the current fiery independence movement, the Indonesian people are gradually leaning towards the People's United Front led by the Communist Party in the bloody tests. The People's Army under the leadership of the Communist Party has grown to tens of thousands of people, and the strengthening of the left-wing forces in the Indonesian National Committee is proof of this. The People's United Front firmly advocates seeking assistance from international friend the Soviet Union, achieving 100% independence for Indonesia, and resolutely crushing the new offensive of the Dutch army. They firmly advocate confiscating Dutch industries to increase the war economy and, while persisting in the war of resistance, first crush the Dutch-British-American colonial economic network in Indonesia. This is because the Indonesian people's economy is entirely built on a self-reliant agricultural economy, and Indonesian land originally belongs to the state, so people can easily obtain land without going through land revolution to develop the agricultural economy. After imperialist factories and farms are taken over, Indonesia will have huge state capital. The People's United Front's proposal meets the demands of tens of millions of Indonesian people. Under the new offensive of the Dutch reactionaries, the Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian people are shouting: "Resolutely arm ourselves for self-defense, crush the Dutch army's offensive, launch worker-peasant movements, launch new cultural movements, launch the struggle against compradors and against aggression!"

　　印度尼西亚
    印度尼西亚的旧名为“东印度”，为荷兰帝国主义所定，中国之所谓“南洋群岛”，即指此。最先使用“印度尼西亚”名称者，为美国人路安，时在一八五○年。这个名词，目前成为印尼民族统一战线的标帜（简称印尼），荷方曾不承认此名，直至一九四○年才正式承认。印尼区域包括爪哇、苏门答腊、婆罗洲、西利伯斯及小巽他、新几尼亚的一部。疆界西起苏门答腊的沙璜，东迄新几尼亚中部，北滨菲律宾，南横印度洋，大小岛屿二千多，面积七四三、三四○方哩，人口七千二百万，大部信回教。爪哇为世界人口最稠密之所，出产有橡皮、石油、米、茶、咖啡、淡巴菰、锡、香料、甘蔗、烟草等，锡的产量占世界总产量百分之廿，石油占百分之十。
    印尼的社会性质，自原始共产社会，直至资本主义社会，均保留或明或暗的各种面影。七世纪到十世纪时，就有巴邻旁（亦称巨港）的西利维迦耶王国，十三世纪到十五世纪，在爪哇有马迦波叶王国，统一了几乎今日所有的印尼国境，封建政治接受了印度的传统。殖民地时代开始于一五○九年葡萄牙势力东渐之时，后代之以西班牙，两者为期均短。一五九九年荷兰人于苏门答腊设东印度公司，强租土地，开始资本主义的剥削以迄于今。爪哇六十万荷亩的农场生产，变成荷兰资本家肥胖的发源地，使他们在数十年内获得八十万万美元的利润。在巴达维亚等各大城市中，集中了荷兰人的财富，配合了英美资本的侵淫，（在投资上，荷兰占第一位，英国第二，美国第三；在商品经济上，物产输入输出的总和，英国占第一位，美国第二，荷兰第三。）构成了印尼殖民地社会。而在农村里，在苏岛，五十年前还处于农业公社时代；在婆罗洲，达耶克族散居的地方，至今还保持了大家族的农业公社形态；在新几尼亚，巴布亚族与加燕族还是猎狩时代的生活。
    印尼共和国政治上直属地区为爪哇、苏岛、马都拉。婆罗洲与西利伯斯人民正要求加入（荷方仅承认前者，企图使婆、西两岛仍为其殖民地，并借以挑拨分化，破坏独立运动）。共和国设民族委员会（相当于国民议会），回教同盟占六十七席，国民党五十五席，共产党、社会党、劳工党各占三十五席。大总统苏加诺、副总统哈达、内阁总理沙里尔（兼长外交内政两部）、国防部长兼陆军总司令苏迪曼、财政部长苏纳尔，其他教育、宣传、交通等部长上自总理下至阁员均未满五十岁，大抵为知识分子出身，且多国外留学者。
    印尼独立运动由来已久，由于荷兰帝国主义的分化离间，以及印尼上层的农民落后性，回教思想的排外性，与小资产阶级无谓的恐苏心理，使革命不得不走上曲折的道路。一九二一年印尼共产党即已成立，到一九二六年统一了一切党派（良知社、回教联盟等）的左翼分子，掀起大革命，荷方损失惨重，但终为其武装镇压，一九二九年共产党员被放逐的（包括首领沙德约诺在内）在千人以上。一九二七年苏加诺从其岳父的回教联盟中脱出而成立国民党，一直到现在，苏氏成为印尼共和国的总统，但在他的一派之中，有些人认为印尼民族资本发展的道路，首先便是打击中国侨商，另外加上荷兰人的挑拨，在去年曾经连续发生抢劫华侨财产及虐杀华人的惨案。在对荷兰经曲折的谈判中，印尼国民党所表现的也常是飘忽不定，他们绅士式的观点，只看到了这样的事实：（一）印尼人民还没有充分自治力量，斗争中的越轨行动，抢劫掠夺不时发生；（二）印尼人的百分之百的独立，今天还非时候；（三）主张外资无限制输入，转而从商业资本中培养印尼的资本。这些观点与策略路线基本上正中了荷兰帝国主义所希望的一套，因此没有多久，国民党内部闹着分裂，而另有社会党与劳工党出现。
    在目前的如火如荼的独立运动中，印尼人民在血腥考验中逐渐倾向于共产党领导下的人民统一战线派，共产党领导下的人民军已发展为数万人，而这次印尼民族委员会左翼势力的增强，亦即一明证。人民统一战线派坚决主张争取国际友人苏联的援助，取得印尼百分之百的独立，坚决粉碎荷军的新进攻。他们坚决主张没收荷兰产业，增加抗战经济，在坚持抗战中首先粉碎荷兰英美对印尼的殖民经济网。这是因为印尼人民经济，全部建筑在自力更生的农业经济上，而印尼的土地原来是国有的，人民得到土地非常容易，不必经过土地革命即可发展农业经济，帝国主义工厂、农场被接管后，印尼即会有巨大的国家资本，人民统一战线派的主张正是符合了数千万印尼人民的要求。在荷兰反动派新的进攻下，印尼共产党与印尼人民正喊着：“坚决武装自卫，粉碎荷军的进攻，展开工农运动，展开新文化运动，展开反买办反侵略的斗争！”
