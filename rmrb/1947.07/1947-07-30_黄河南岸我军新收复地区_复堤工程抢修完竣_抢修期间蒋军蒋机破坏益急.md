Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, July 28th - The river embankment restoration project in the newly recovered areas on the south bank of the Yellow River has been completed by tens of thousands of civilian laborers, overcoming the sabotage of Chiang Kai-shek's army and aircraft, by the 25th of this month. Before June 30th, during the period when Chiang's army occupied the area, the democratic government also led the masses to seize the gaps in the enemy's sabotage to carry out emergency repairs on the south bank. The dangerous projects of Guozhuang and Sunlou in ＠shan (newly established county on the south bank of Shouzhang), and the Zhongbingdui dangerous project in Yuncheng, were thus spared from collapse. After the People's Liberation Army crossed the river on July 1st, cadres from ＠shan, Yuncheng, Shounan (newly established county), Juancheng, and the Nanhua and Dongming county sections of the First River Defense Office, immediately conducted surveys and measurements. With the great flood approaching, the masses responded enthusiastically and rushed to the site. On the Lin Huang embankment, which stretches more than two hundred miles from Shilipu in ＠shan County to Juancheng and Linpuji, there were more than 70,000 people engaged in emergency repairs. From Shilipu in ＠shan County to the Luxia Southwest section of the dam and dangerous project, which is twenty miles long, more than 20,000 people from ＠shan, Dongping, and Nanwang counties participated. ＠shan County also rushed to repair the canal embankment from Shilipu to Yuankou, which is more than a hundred miles long, with 2,000 large carts transporting stone back and forth every day, and more than 13,000 cubic meters of stone had been transported by the 20th. In addition, the Yuncheng section and the Yunbei section started construction on the 12th and 13th respectively, and the projects have been completed one after another. Among them, Tang Yujie, the district chief of the fourth district of Yuncheng, took the lead in piling up earth, using a total of 150,000 cubic meters of earthwork, and the entire project was completed in five days. During this period, Chiang Kai-shek's army and aircraft intensified their sabotage. On the 15th, Geng Weiming's troops of Dongming General divided their forces and invaded northward. At the Linpuji dangerous project, they dispersed our dike repair workers, and captured three of our cadres who were leading the dike repair in Yuanchang and buried them alive in Linpu. On the night of the 19th, Chiang's special agents secretly cut more than a dozen roots of the dam cable (note: ropes for binding grass material for dangerous projects) in Hongsouchang. On the 18th, a Chiang's aircraft dropped nine bombs and strafed more than 2,000 bullets in the area of Guozhuang dangerous project in ＠shan, killing three cart drivers transporting stone and wounding nine people, and killing seventeen oxen transporting stone. On the 20th, four oxen transporting stone were killed in Shenlou.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, July 28th - The people of Qidong and Zhang (Qiu) Li (cheng) counties in the Bohai area have organized river defense teams to protect the Yellow River embankment. On the 13th, Chiang's puppet troops advanced towards the Hujia'an area on the south bank of the Yellow River in the third district of Zhangli, and were repelled by the river defense team of the county. The Qidong River Defense Team captured four Chiang's secret agents who were sabotaging river defenses on the night of the 12th.
