　　Remarkable Achievements of Taihang Militia
  　Eliminating 4,000 Enemies in Six Months
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Taihang Military Commission recently announced the war achievements of the militia in the entire region for the first half of this year. In the past six months, the militia in various parts of the region have actively cooperated with local armed forces to protect their homes, fields, and wheat harvest, and launched guerrilla warfare, achieving great results. According to incomplete statistics, the entire region fought a total of 1,077 battles, with 23,926 militiamen participating. They killed, wounded, and captured 3,676 enemy, puppet, and special agents, and won over 556 enemy and puppet soldiers through disintegration tactics. They seized 2 mortars, 27 small cannons, 29 light machine guns, 1,517 rifles, 60 pistols, 32,050 rounds of various ammunition, six boxes of ammunition, 442 landmines, 15 telephones, 1 radio, 19 barrels of kerosene, and 2,518 head of livestock and sheep. In the past six months, the militia's combat effectiveness has shown a great improvement. Notable examples include: the Pingding militia's North Village annihilation battle on March 6, achieving a score of zero casualties against 34 enemies eliminated; the ambush battle in Guitun, Bo'ai; the landmine ambush battle in Gaobei, Qi County on April 4; the ambush battle in Jiaozuo and Wuzhi militia in Fucheng Village in mid-April, eliminating 21 enemies in five minutes; the Yangju and work team's Red Sand Ridge ambush explosion battle during the wheat harvest protection; and the battles in which the Hui County militia annihilated the landlord special agent armed forces such as the United Village Association. Secondly, the explosion campaign has been launched throughout the region. The First Military Subdistrict, which had always been quiet in explosion activities, also showed unprecedented activity in protecting the wheat harvest. Incomplete statistics for two months show that 120 landmines were exploded, killing or wounding 90 enemy and puppet soldiers. The unprecedented explosion battle in Wangwang Waling Village on April 19 also emerged. Under the leadership of the explosion hero Mu Xicheng, every household in the village had mines and everyone knew how to use them. On April 19, when the Yan bandit troops came to the village to plunder, 52 stone mines and 30 landmines were detonated, killing 38 enemies and wounding 50. Our armed cadres at all levels have further recognized and attached importance to the explosion campaign. In actual combat, the experience of combining explosion with ambush, capture and other tactics is becoming increasingly rich.
