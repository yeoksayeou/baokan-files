Counter-Offensive Shoes
	130,000 Pairs Completed Ahead of Schedule in Northern Yue
[This newspaper's Taiyue 20th dispatch] Under the call to fully support the counter-offensive, women who had been emancipated in the northern Yue area enthusiastically and actively rushed to make military shoes. 130,000 pairs of military shoes were completed one month ahead of schedule, and the quality exceeded that of the past. When this task reached various counties, the emancipated women in various places regarded it as an honor to make counter-offensive military shoes for their brothers and sons. Immediately, a competition wave was set off. In Qin County, more than 20,000 young women made one pair each, and made mutual guarantees: square toe, round opening, three-layer sole, new inside and out, well-stitched, weighing one catty, strong and durable, and completed in ten days. Qin Yuan, which has always been a model, took the lead in completing the task. Villages such as Weicun in the Third District completed the task of 80 pairs of military shoes in three days through mutual aid and labor exchange. Huo County completed the task in half a month. Twenty-six students from Tunliu No. 1 Elementary School voluntarily participated in making counter-offensive military shoes.
