    Xinhua News Agency, Liaodong, 15th—The masses in the newly recovered areas of Dongfeng, Xifeng, Kaiyuan, Qingyuan, and other places have mobilized more than 20,000 people and over 1,000 carts to support the front lines. In one district of Xifeng alone, 700 stretcher-bearers were organized to transport the wounded in shifts. The stretcher-bearers took great care of the wounded, automatically camouflaging the stretchers to prevent enemy aircraft from reconnaissance and strafing, and personally fed the wounded.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 15th—The people of Harbin are enthusiastically joining the war effort and enlisting in the army. A 2,000-strong soldiers' regiment and a 3,000-strong war participation corps have already departed for the front lines a few days ago. 200,000 pairs of victory military shoes will also be completed by the end of August. In recent days, the main streets of Daoli and Daowai in Harbin have been crowded with hundreds of thousands of people seeing off those joining the army and the war effort. Women competed to present heroes with red silk and flowers, and district chiefs personally led the horses for the soldiers joining the army. When the brave men joining the army and the war effort, riding tall horses and wearing colorful flowers on their chests, passed by, the streets resounded with gongs and drums, and the crowds thronged, vying to see the heroes' majestic appearance, with continuous and fervent cheers. The enthusiastic scene was unprecedented in Harbin.
