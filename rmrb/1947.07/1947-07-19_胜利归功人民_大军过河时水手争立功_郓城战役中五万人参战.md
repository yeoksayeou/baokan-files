Xinhua News Agency, Front Line, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 17th: Without the assistance of boatmen, sailors, and militia along the Yellow River, the People's Liberation Army would not have been able to break through the natural barrier of the river defense so quickly. Long ago, boatmen and sailors began building ferries for the People's Liberation Army and cooperated with the militia to monitor the enemy on the south bank and protect the ferries. Sailors in Pingyin County, under the firepower blockade of the Chiang army, secretly pulled nineteen large boats across the Si River at night to the ferry crossing where the People's Liberation Army was preparing to cross the river. They excitedly declared: "The boats must be fast and stable!" "We are sending our own troops across the river; we will use all our abilities!" Sailors competed to have the troops board their boats first. Militia sailor Liu Huiwen, after rushing the first boat across, excitedly said: "That good-for-nothing Chiang Kai-shek has tormented the Henan people for too long. I'll be the first to row across and quickly capture those bastards alive!" Sailor Liu Juncai said: "I didn't get to row the first boat, but I must row a few more times." Some rowed twelve times, even eighteen times. These bare-chested sailors, covered in sweat, enthusiastically shouted, rowing back and forth. A certain unit's assault platoon, aboard Liu Mingxing's boat, sped to the other side, attacking the pillbox at Liqiaokou. The Chiang soldiers panicked and shouted in dismay: "It's over, run!" Before they could run, they were all captured alive. Then, boat after boat of the People's Liberation Army crossed the surging yellow waves, safely reaching the south bank. After the People's Liberation Army landed, the people in various places on the south bank automatically organized stretcher teams, hitched up carts, and pushed wheelbarrows to help the troops transport ammunition. In the Yuncheng Campaign, men and women, old and young, throughout the county, worked day and night to grind flour and rice for the attacking troops. Young and strong men helped dig fortifications. In one campaign alone, 50,000 people enthusiastically participated.

    胜利归功人民
    大军过河时水手争立功
    郓城战役中五万人参战
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线十七日电】没有黄河沿岸船工、水手、民兵的协助，解放军将是不能这样迅速地冲破河防天险的。很久以前船工水手就为人民解放军赶造渡船，并配合民兵监视南岸敌人，保护渡船。平阴县水手们曾在蒋军火力封锁下夜间泗水将十九只大船拉至人民解放军准备过河的渡口，他们兴高采烈的提出：“船要开得快，开得稳！”“送咱们自己的队伍过河，有多大本领用多大本领！”水手们争着要部队先上自己的船。民兵水手刘会文抢渡头一船后，兴奋的说：“老蒋这个孬种糟蹋河南老百姓日子不少了，俺先撑头一船，好快去活捉狗日的。”水手刘俊彩说：“咱没撑上头船，一定要多撑几趟。”有的撑了十二趟，甚至十八趟。这些赤臂光胸满脸大汗的水手们，劲头十足的吆喝着，撑过来又撑过去，某部突击排坐着刘明星的船，飞驶对岸，攻到了李桥口地堡跟前，蒋军惊慌地失声乱叫：“坏了，跑吧！”没等撒开腿，就全部被活捉了。接着一船又一船的人民解放军越过汹涌澎湃的黄色波涛，平安的到达南岸。各渡口的大小船只在这样互相比赛立功争先下，都能在五分钟渡过宽达一里的河面，无一出险。人民解放军登岸后，南岸各地老百姓，即自动组织担架队，套上大车，推着小车，帮助部队运输弹药。在郓城战役中，全县男女老幼，不分昼夜为攻城部队磨面碾米，青壮年帮助挖工事，一个战役就有五万人民热烈参战。
