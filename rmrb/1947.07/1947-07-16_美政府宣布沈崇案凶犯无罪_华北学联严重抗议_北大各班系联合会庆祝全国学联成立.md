    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 12th: Beiping newspapers report: The North China Student Federation, regarding the U.S. Naval authorities' declaration of innocence for Pearson, the perpetrator who raped Peking University student Ms. Shen Chong, has lodged a serious protest with the Chiang government and the U.S. government. The Peking University Departments and Systems Joint Association has also put forward three demands: (1) The original judgment must not be changed. (2) Ms. Shen Chong must be compensated for all material and emotional losses. (3) The U.S. Naval military court's retrial clearly protects Pearson, which is unreasonable, and any unfair decision is invalid.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 12th: Beiping newspapers report: The All-China Student Federation, composed of students from North China, Wuhan, Shanghai, Zhejiang and other regions, was established in Shanghai in late June. Although Chiang Kai-shek ordered its dissolution, the Peking University Departments and Systems Joint Association still held a celebration meeting for the founding of the All-China Student Federation on the evening of the 29th of last month at the Peking University Democracy Square, attended by hundreds of representatives from various departments and systems. The chairman first gave a speech, and representatives from various organizations recited poems. This was followed by a report on the formation of the All-China Student Federation, and a professor gave a lecture on "Democracy and the Student Federation." After the lecture, the students cheered, and the meeting dispersed at 9 o'clock. The North China Student Federation also posted slogans on the Democracy Wall, the flag of democracy fluttered on the top of the building, and issued an article "North China Students Cheer for the Founding of the All-China Student Federation," calling on students to continue to fight for peace and freedom.

    美政府宣布沈崇案凶犯无罪
    华北学联严重抗议
    北大各班系联合会庆祝全国学联成立
    【新华社晋察冀十二日电】北平报载：华北学联为美海军当局宣布强奸北大女生沈崇女士之凶手皮尔逊无罪事，顷向蒋政府及美国政府提出严重抗议。北大院系联合会并提出三项主张：（一）原判结果不得变更。（二）必须赔偿沈崇女士物质精神各方面之损失。（三）美海军军事法庭的复判显然包庇皮尔逊，是不合理的，如有任何不公平的决定亦属无效。
    【新华社晋察冀十二日电】北平报载：由华北、武汉、上海、浙江等各区学生所组成之全国学生联合会已于上月下旬在沪成立，虽经蒋贼迫令解散，但北大各班系联合会仍于上月廿九日晚在北大民主广场举行庆祝全国学联成立大会，出席各班系代表数百人。首由主席致词、各社团代表朗读颂诗，继报告全国学联组成经过，并由某教授讲演“民主与学联”，讲毕同学欢呼，大会九时始散。华北学联并于民主墙上张贴标语，民主大旗飘扬在楼顶上，并印发“华北学生为全国学联成立而欢呼”一文，呼吁学生们继续为和平、自由而奋斗。
