Recollections of Disaster and Famine

Speaking of it, it's truly miserable,
The disastrous famine years of '42 and '43.
Every family was at their wit's end,
Houses, land, clothes,
Furniture, all sold off clean.
First-class irrigated land, dozens of plots,
Dry land wouldn't fetch ten yuan;
Good cabinets and wardrobes, ten jin of rice,
Clothes and fabrics weren't worth a penny.
Even so, nobody wanted them,
Only then did we flee to Shanxi in famine,
How much clothing and fabric we carried,
Exchanged for a bag of dried radish slices.
We suffered so much,
And the enemy puppets still harmed us.
Beating us and cursing us,
Ultimately squeezing us dry.
Enduring hunger and returning home,
The whole family in tears.
Tears flowing, nothing to be done,
Enduring famine again to flee disaster.
Going down coal mines in Meitu Gully,
Pushing carts in Guantai Kiln.
Already without strength in our bodies,
Dizzy and unable to work;
Aching back and weak legs, useless,
For a moment, without caution, falling headfirst.
Selling sons and daughters in other lands,
Loving couples separated. . .
The more I think, the more heartbroken,
Quickly prepare for famine to resist drought.
Although recently there has been some rain,
Relying solely on that won't stick.
Hurry and plant, diligently weed the seedlings,
Plant more autumn vegetables, strive to be models.
Men, women, old, and young all work together,
Join forces to overcome the famine year.
Everyone follows the Communist Party,
Act according to the government's laws,
No more fleeing to suffer,
Defeat old Chiang and conquer Heaven!

    忆·灾·荒
    提起来，真凄惨，
    四二四三灾荒年。
    家家时光没法办，
    房产、地土、衣
    服、家俱都卖干。
    头等水地几十块，
    旱地卖不上十块钱；
    好棹好柜十斤米，
    衣服布匹不值钱。
    就那样也是没人要，
    才到山西逃荒年，
    衣裳布匹背多少，
    换回一包罗卜片。
    咱们受了多少罪，
    敌伪还要坑害咱。
    又是打来又是骂，
    结果东西逼个干。
    忍饥挨饿回家转，
    居家大小泪涟涟。
    泪涟涟，没法办，
    重打饥荒去逃难。
    煤土沟里下煤窑，
    罐台窑上去推罐。
    本来身上没有劲，
    头＠眼黑不能干；
    腰酸腿软不济事，
    一时不防倒栽蒜。
    亲儿亲女他乡卖，
    恩爱夫妻两失散。……
    越思越想越心酸，
    赶快备荒来抗旱。
    虽说近来下了点雨，
    光靠这点也不粘。
    快抢种，勤锄苗，
    多种秋菜争模范。
    男女老少齐动手，
    合力战胜灾荒年。
    大家跟着共产党，
    照着政府的法儿办，
    再不逃难去受苦，
    打败老蒋战胜天！
