[Hebei Daily, July 7th] Farmers throughout southern Hebei are currently battling pests, the biggest enemy of current crops. In Jing County, mole cricket infestations were so severe that some fields had to be sown three times without seedlings emerging. In the sixth district of Ji County, nearly all spring and late seedlings were eaten and killed by mole crickets. Mole cricket infestations are present throughout Qinghe, Nangong, and Wei County. Locust plagues continue to develop in seven or eight counties including Wei County, Wu Yi and Hengshui. Cadres and the masses alike greatly emphasize this, calling out everywhere: "Protect the autumn seedlings!" "Insect pests are like miniature Chiang Kai-sheks endangering military supplies and the people's food!" Based on the severity of the insect plague in each area, men, women, and children are organized to launch attacks, or women and children are mainly organized, to carry out a campaign to capture and eliminate insect pests, with great success. In Nangong's four districts, more than 160,000 mole crickets and 20,000 "big-eyed thieves" (gophers) were captured in 30 days. Li Buyin, a turned-over meritorious peasant, and Su Hanying, the village chief of Pujiao, led militiamen, children, and women to irrigate the "big-eyed thieves" with water and made specific calculations for the masses to raise their morale. One "big-eyed thief" can cause one mu of soybean land to yield nothing; catching 89 of them today can save 89 mu of seedlings, which is equivalent to planting 89 more mu, calling on everyone to compete and make contributions. In Qinghe's fourth district, each subdistrict has established a mole cricket capture command, and each village has organized a mole cricket capture committee. Fires are lit across the fields at night, and people can be seen digging everywhere in the fields during the day. Each village has also produced skilled and heroic mole cricket catchers; 50 children in Quanli Village caught 1,430 in one day, and the director of the Dasezhuang Farmers' Association personally led a group of 19 people to capture more than 800 in one morning, and are now preparing for a blitz. Wei County has completely eliminated locust nymphs. Village cadres in Wu Yi and Hengshui districts are leading the broad masses in carrying out a locust extermination campaign. When Wu Yi district chief Li Bunu led the masses in suppressing locusts, he shouted while fighting: "Don't let a single locust Chiang thief escape, completely eliminate them!" Within three days, the banks of the Zhanghe River, the Ganhe River, and the Qingliang River were mostly wiped out, and now they are circling back to eliminate locusts that have escaped into the reed grass nests and thorny bushes. Because Wu Yi's fifth district is busy replanting late seedlings, the children have mostly cleared the locusts on both sides of the Zhanghe River, and the government is now preparing to award them with prize banners and certificates. To capture and eliminate insect plagues, various places have created many methods: First, catching mole crickets: (1) At night, divide into groups to light fires to attract mole crickets for capture; (2) Spread manure piles everywhere (horse manure is best) to attract them to gather, and after overnight, insert wooden-handled poles to startle the mole crickets out, thereby capturing them. Second, catching rats ("big-eyed thieves"): irrigate with water. There must be more in places with new soil piles or newly dug holes and many small holes, and fewer otherwise. "Big-eyed thieves" love cleanliness, and irrigating with dirty water is even more effective.
    [Hebei Daily, July 7th] Due to prolonged drought, autumn seedlings in Jincheng, Qinshui, Wangwu, Shimin, and other counties have suffered from insect pests. After production committees at all levels organized pest control, significant results have been achieved. Locust nymphs in the first and second districts of Qinshui have been completely eliminated. Lai Village in Jincheng recently discovered that black grubs were biting and killing seedlings. All the women and children in the village worked together and caught a total of 27 jin and 10 liang of black grubs in five days. Now, a pest control competition has been launched throughout the village. On June 9th, the Second District Production Committee issued a notice to the entire district commending Lai Village and calling on all villages to immediately mobilize men, women, and children to capture insect pests upon discovery. A large number of spotted insects have recently been found in Mouting, Shangwoquan, and other villages in the second district of Qinshui, severely damaging seedlings. Mouting Administrative Village alone has lost 15 mu of sweet potatoes in five days, and a lot of millet and beans have also been eaten. On June 7th, Qianling mobilized all the children and women to go to the fields early in the morning to fight, and the village has now mostly eliminated them within its borders.

　　遍地点火杀蝼蛄

  　冀南各地群起打害虫
    【本报冀南七日电】冀南各地农民正与当前农作物最大敌人害虫进行斗争。景县蝼蛄灾便有些地播种三次未能生苗。冀县六区春苗晚苗几全被蝼蛄咬死吃光。清河、南宫、威县全境皆有蝼蛄灾。魏县、武邑、衡水等七八县蝗情尚继续发展。干群对此极为重视，到处呼唤：“保护秋苗”“虫害就是危害军需民食的小老蒋”；各地分别虫灾轻重，组织男女老幼齐出击，或以儿童妇女为主组织起来，展开捕灭虫灾运动，成绩巨大。南宫四个区在三十天内即捉蝼蛄十六万个以上，“大眼贼”（地鼠）两万。普济桥翻身功臣李步印、村长苏汉英带领民兵儿童妇女用水灌“大眼贼”，并给群众具体算帐，以提高群众斗志。有一个“大眼贼”能使一亩豆地无收成，今天捉了八十九个，就能救八十九亩小苗，等于多种了八十九亩苗，号召大家竞赛，人人立功。清河四区各小区已成立捕蝼蛄指挥部，各村组织起捕蝼蛄委员会，入晚遍野燃火，白天地里到处人见挖掘。各村并出现捉蝼蛄的能手与英雄；劝理村五十个儿童一天捉了一千四百三十个，大瑟庄农会主任亲自领一个组，十九个人一早晨逮捕八百多个，现正准备突击。魏县已全部消灭蝗蝻。武邑、衡水区村干部正带领广大群众展开灭蝗运动，武邑区长李不奴带领群众在剿蝗时，一面打一面呼喊：“不放走一个蝗蒋贼，完全消灭它”，三天内漳河、干河、清凉江两岸，大部被歼，现在回剿逃避于芦苇草窝荆丛中的蝗虫。武邑五区因正忙于抢种晚苗，儿童把漳河两岸蝗虫大部肃清，政府现准备给以奖旗奖状。捕灭虫灾，各地创造许多办法，第一、捉蝼蛄：（一）夜间分组点火将蝼蛄引来捕捉之；（二）遍地粪堆（马粪最好），引其聚集，隔夜后以木柄杆子插入，蝼蛄即惊出，从而捕之。第二、捉鼠（大眼贼）用水灌，在有新土堆或有新扒的洞和有许多小洞的地方必多，反之则少，大眼贼性爱干净，以脏水灌更收效。
    【本报太岳七日电】晋城、沁水、王屋、士敏等县秋苗因久旱发生虫害，经各级生产委员会组织扑虫后，已有显著成绩。沁水一、二两区蝗蝻已全部肃清。晋城来村最近发现黑婆婆把小苗咬死，全村的妇女儿童都一齐动了手，在五天内共捉了二十七斤十两黑婆婆，现在全村已展开了扑虫竞赛。二区生产委员会于六月九号通报全区表扬来村，并号召各村发现了虫害的，立即动员男女老少一齐捕捉。沁水二区牟亭、上沃泉等村最近发现斑虫很多，伤害小苗非常厉害，仅牟亭一个行政村五天内就伤害十五亩山药蛋，还有谷地、豆子也吃了不少。六月七日，前岭发动全体儿童妇女一早上地去打，现该村境内已大部消灭。
