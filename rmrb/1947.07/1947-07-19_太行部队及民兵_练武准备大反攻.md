Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 14th: Troops on the Yubei front in the Taihang area and militia in counties such as Zuoquan and Neiqiu have launched a wave of enthusiasm for practicing martial arts and striving for merit, awaiting orders to depart and participate in the counteroffensive. Various units have universally convened "Zhuge Liang Meetings" and "Sharpening Knife Meetings" to leverage the wisdom and skills of all soldiers to contribute to the counteroffensive front. A certain unit publishes soldiers' training achievements, quick reports, and cartoons on the blackboard newspaper on a regular basis. The Merit Citation Committee stipulates that soldiers whose training results are published five times can be discussed for merit citation. More than 150 members of the Zuoquan Second District Joint Defense Militia proposed a self-study plan to strive for merit, challenging each other, with each person striving to throw grenades 35 meters and master various shooting actions. Wang Dianying, director of the Qianzhiyu Military Affairs Committee, organized the thirteen militiamen in the village into a production mutual aid group, using rest and nap time to explain military knowledge and conduct field exercises. Militia members in Xiaoxi Village, Neiqiu, carry hand grenades and guns when they go to the fields, and practice aiming and throwing during breaks. They also lead self-defense team members in learning how to lay mines and shoot guns.

    太行部队及民兵
    练武准备大反攻
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十四日电】太行区豫北前线部队及左权、内邱等县民兵掀起练武立功热潮，待命出发，参加反攻。各部队遍普召集“诸葛亮会”、“磨刀会”，发挥全军战士智慧和技能贡献反攻前线。某部按期出门板报登载战士们的练兵成绩、快报、漫画。立功委员会规定练兵成绩，登出五次者，即可讨论立功。左权二区联防民兵百五十余人提出自学立功计划，互相挑战，每人争取投弹三十五米，熟练射击各种动作。前直峪武委会主任王殿英将该村十三个民兵组织一生产互助组，利用休息及午睡时讲解军事知识，进行实地演习。内邱小西村民兵去地里都带上手榴弹和枪，一休息便练习瞄准投掷。并带领自卫队员学习埋雷打枪。
