　　Combining Weeding, Field Inspection, and Property Investigation
  　Duanjiazhuang Clears Out "Transformed" Landlords
    [Report from this newspaper] After the fourth round of general training for farmers in the first district of Yushe, farmers awakened and improved their awareness. After returning to their villages, they launched a pursuit battle of checking fields, classes, and economy in conjunction with production. Production teams in various villages combined deliberation with weeding during the day and held meetings to discuss at night. Zhao Hucheng, a farmer from Duanjiazhuang, returned to the village and raised the issue of class designation, saying: Wang Silong in our village had more than 900 mu of land before the war, lived by exploitation, and often said: "I am not afraid of droughts or floods. If there is a drought, I have the Mao Lan River beach; if there is a flood, I have the Dalouniu mud." After the war, in order to evade burdens, he sold bad land and kept good land, separated his family, and still raises sheep. He was designated as a middle peasant in last year's movement. After inspection, a struggle was launched. Similarly, Xingzhen, Donghui, and Nanwang villages also found that landlords had hidden things during last year's movement, while crying poor and begging for mercy, deceiving the masses and making the movement not thorough enough. After this agricultural training, farmers returned to the village and found that landlords had hidden 82 houses, 110 mu of land, and clothing, grain, agricultural tools, livestock, etc., totaling 4 million yuan. The masses unanimously said: Even if the landlord's door is rotten, there are still three copper coins worth of gold nails. We cannot completely turn ourselves over unless we overthrow the landlords.

    [Report from this newspaper, Taiyue, 26th] Wang Yonglu, Shen Zuofu and other landlords and despots in Shenxian Village, Jiang County, used feudal societies to fool farmers and undermine land reform. Landlords Wang Yonglu and Shen Zuofu in Shenxian Village organized "One Heart Heaven Path," deceiving farmers by saying: "There will be forty days of darkness this year, and wolves and tigers will come down from the mountains to eat people. Those who enter the Tao can avoid the three disasters." As a result, more than 40 of the 50 households in the entire village fell into the trap. Those who entered the Tao paid Tao fees every month. From last December to now, farmers have paid Wang, Shen, and others wheat, cloth, and other items worth more than 68,000 yuan. At the same time, the Tao also harbored more than 30 fugitive landlords, forming a reactionary group, burning incense and kowtowing all day long, instilling in farmers the ignorant idea of ​​"don't fight back when others hit you, don't talk back when others scold you" in order to weaken the farmers' fighting will. After the Farmers' Association discovered and investigated, it immediately detained the culprits such as Wang Yonglu, inspired the deceived farmers to complain and demand land and wealth from them.

　　结合锄苗查田查财
  　段家庄清出“化形”地主
    【本报讯】榆社一区农民第四次普训后，觉悟空前提高，回村后结合了生产展开查田查阶级查经济的追击战。各村生产组白天锄苗中结合酝酿，夜间开会讨论。段家庄农民赵虎成回村，提出划成份问题说：咱村王四隆战前有地九百余亩靠剥削生活并经常说：“咱是水旱灾都不怕的，旱了我有毛岚河滩，水灾我有大脑牛烂。”战后为逃避负担卖坏地留好地，家庭分居开，现在还养的羊，去年运动中划成中农了。检查后又展开了斗争。又杏榛、东汇、南王村也同样查出了去年运动中地主将东西隐藏，一方面又哭穷求饶，蒙蔽了群众的耳目，所以运动不够彻底。这次农训后，农民回村查出地主埋伏东西计房子八十二间，土地一百一十亩及衣服、粮食、农具牲畜等共达四百万元，群众一致说：地主门扇烂了还有三钱金钉子，斗不垮地主是不能彻底翻身的。（节约小报）
    【本报太岳二十六日电】绛县神仙村地主奸霸利用封建会门愚弄农民，破坏土地改革。神仙村地主王永禄、申作符等，组织“一心天道”，欺骗农民说：“今年要黑四十天，狼虎下山吃人，凡入道的人能避三灾。”于是全村五十余户即有四十余户上了圈套。入道的人每月交纳道费，从去年腊月至现在农民即纳给王、申等麦子、布等物品，价值六万八千余元。同时该道并窝藏三十余户逃亡地主，组成一个反动集团，终日烧香叩头给农民灌输：“别人打不还手，别人骂不还口”的愚昧思想，以消弱农民的斗争意志，经农会发觉调查后，立即将王永禄等祸首扣押，启发被骗农民向其诉苦要地、要财。
