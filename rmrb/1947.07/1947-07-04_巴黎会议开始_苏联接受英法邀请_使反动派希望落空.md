Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: News from various sources: The Three Foreign Ministers Conference of the Soviet Union, Britain, and France began on the 27th in the sweltering heat at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Paris. The meeting lasted four hours, from 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM. The content of the discussions was kept strictly secret, and the scheduled press conference was also temporarily cancelled. Molotov, accompanied by seven staff members, was the first to leave the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 8:04 PM. Bevin, accompanied by the British Ambassador to France, Sir Oliver Harvey, and advisors, left at 8:15 PM. Bevin had three lengthy talks in London with US Undersecretary of State Clayton before flying from England to France on the morning of the 27th. Clayton remained in London and indicated that he did not intend to go to Paris during the initial consultation phase of the Three Foreign Ministers Conference.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Agence France-Presse, Paris: The Three Foreign Ministers Conference of the Soviet Union, Britain, and France convened at 4:00 PM on the 28th and adjourned at 6:35 PM. The next meeting is scheduled for the afternoon of the 30th.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: TASS, Paris, 27th: At the time of the Paris Three Foreign Ministers Conference, US Treasury Secretary Snyder said a few days ago that he did not believe that the content of the Marshall Plan should be interpreted as containing an invitation to other countries to request greater economic assistance from the United States than in the past. Snyder declared: Marshall only meant to urge European countries to investigate what they can do for themselves. Snyder's words have forced some British and French newspapers to doubt the seriousness of the Marshall Plan in this regard, and whether there is such a plan at all. Some French people speculate that Snyder's statement may be an amendment that wipes out the Marshall Plan. Judging from the comments of reactionary newspapers, some people had little expectation that the Soviet Union would accept the invitation from Britain and France to participate in discussions on the issues involved in the Marshall Plan. Some stubbornly reactionary elements originally believed that the Soviet Union would abandon participating in the Allied countries' conference on European economic recovery, which would facilitate the task of establishing the notorious Churchill version of the "European Federation" with American assistance. But these hopes have been dashed. Some parties intend to use this fact to explain the appearance of Snyder's remarks. Le Figaro even said: The American government is deeply disturbed by the Soviet Union's acceptance of the invitation to participate in the Paris negotiations.

### 巴黎会议开始　苏联接受英法邀请　使反动派希望落空

　　巴黎会议开始
  　苏联接受英法邀请
  　使反动派希望落空
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】各方消息：苏英法三外长会议已于二十七在炎热的天气下于巴黎法外交部开始举行。会议自下午四时起至八时止，历时四小时；谈商内容，悉守秘密，原定之新闻记者招待会，亦临时取消。莫洛托夫偕同随员七人于八点四分首先离开法外交部，贝文则偕英驻法大使特大古柏及顾问等则于八时十五分离去。贝文系在伦敦与美副国务卿克莱顿三度长谈后，于二十七日上午十一时离英飞法者。克氏则仍留伦敦，曾表示在三外长会议初步商谈阶段。不拟至巴黎。
    【新华社陕北三十日电】法新闻社巴黎讯：苏英法三外长会议二十八日下午四时开会，六时三十五分休会。下次会议定于三十日下午举行。
    【新华社陕北一日电】塔斯社巴黎廿七日电：正当巴黎三外长会议之时，美财长斯奈德日前说，他认为马歇尔计划的内容，不能解释为含有邀请其他国家请求美国给予较过去为大的经济援助的东西。斯奈德宣称：马歇尔只有一个意思，即促使欧罗巴国家调查一下他们能替他们自己作些什么。斯奈德的话使英法某些报纸不得不怀疑马歇尔计划在这方面的严肃性如何，以及究竟有无此种计划。法国某些人士揣测，斯奈德的声明可能是一个把马歇尔计划一笔抹煞的修正案。从反动报纸的评论加以判断，某些人士绝少预料到苏联曾接受英法的邀请参加讨论马歇尔计划中所涉及的问题。某些顽固成性的反动派原认为苏联会放弃参加盟国讨论欧洲经济复兴问题的会议的，这样就可便利于在美国帮助下建立臭名昭彰的邱吉尔版的“欧洲联邦”的任务了。但是这些希望是落空了。某些方面人士意欲用这个事实来说明斯奈德谈话事出现。弗加罗报甚至这样说：对于苏联接受参加巴黎谈判的邀请这件事，美国官方深感不安。
