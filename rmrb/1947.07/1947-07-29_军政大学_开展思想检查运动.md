　　Military and Political University
　　Launches Ideological Examination Movement

　　[Reported by this newspaper] The Political Department of the Military and Political University, on the 9th of this month, specifically instructed all personnel under its jurisdiction to implement an ideological examination movement starting on July 14th. Based on the current understanding of the ideological situation of all personnel in the university, the emphasis is on: the complete eradication of the following ideologies that contradict the current mission. (1) Due to a lack of understanding of the war situation and erroneous individualistic calculations, a fear of death exists among some students; (2) Individual hedonism and corrupt thinking exists among some people; (3) Landlord thinking that hinders land reform exists among some people. Regarding learning methods, the instructions stipulate: (1) Get straight to the point and quickly form an ideological examination movement, without dwelling on documents, without studying the situation in isolation, and starting directly from the task; (2) Leaders at all levels should take the lead and play an exemplary role in the ideological examination; (3) Before the start of the learning, there should be full preparation and deliberation, focusing on dispelling the unwillingness to learn, preventing the idea of only rectifying students and not cadres, and the unwillingness to connect with oneself from the beginning. After the release of this instruction, various units quickly launched a wave of deliberation, opening group meetings, discussions, and formulating individual and collective learning plans. The entire university is filled with a learning atmosphere of ideological examination. (Mei Cun)

　　军政大学
  　开展思想检查运动
    【本报讯】军政大学政治部，于本月九日，特指示所属全体人员，从七月十四日起，实行思想检查运动。根据目前对全校人员思想情况的了解，着重指出：必须彻底肃清下列各种与目前任务相抵触的思想。（一）由于对战争形势的不了解，及错误的个人主义打算，在一部分学员中，存在着的怕死心理；（二）在一部分人中存在着的个人享乐主义，贪污腐化思想；（三）在一部分人中，存在着的障碍土地改革的地主思想。在学习方法上，指示中规定：（一）开门见山，迅速形成思想检查运动，不在文件上打圈子，不单独研究形势，从任务直接着手；（二）各级领导亲自带头，在思想检查中，起模范作用；（三）学习开始前，应有充分准备酝酿，重点是打通不愿学的思想，防止只整学员不整干部的思想，不愿一开始即连系本身的思想。这一指示发布后，各单位很快即展开了酝酿热潮，纷纷开小组会，座谈，讨论，订个人及集体的学习计划，全校充满思想检查的学习空气。（梅村）
