Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th—According to a Central News Agency report from Nanjing: Chiang Kai-shek's "State Council" passed the so-called "Outline for Mobilization to Suppress the Rebellion and Complete Constitutional Government" on the 18th, and the full text has been published. Although this outline contains eighteen articles, it is actually only one: to demand money, grain, and lives from the people in the KMT-controlled areas, and to implement bloody terror, suppress the patriotic movements of the people in the KMT-controlled areas, and completely deprive the people of all freedoms. The outline stipulates that farmers and other classes can be extorted for grain, clothing, military service, and corvée at any time to supply the needs of the counter-revolutionary civil war, and that those who evade or refuse the above-mentioned extortion shall be "punished according to law." For workers, the outline declares that strikes and slowdowns are "acts that hinder production and social order and shall be punished according to law," and restricts and manages the salaries and wages of employees in various industries. For the private industrial, commercial, and financial sectors, the outline stipulates that "active mobilization" (i.e., requisition) of kerosene, steel, medicines, transportation and communication equipment, and other military supplies needed for the counter-revolutionary civil war, and "those who evade or obstruct requisition and purchase shall be punished according to law." Factories and shops that close down due to losses are also called illegal and "punished according to law." For fuel, textiles, smelting, and industrial and mining enterprises with "special needs," the Chiang government will "manage" their finished products. The transaction prices of daily necessities, the circulation of materials, the circulation of funds, and financial business will also be restricted or managed, and it is stipulated that taxes will be increased to supply the civil war. On the other hand, the mobilization outline stipulates the continued holding of fake "National Assembly" and "Legislative Yuan" elections to complete the so-called "constitutional government," which requires more blood and more prisons. Thus, the outline states that "the government shall punish gatherings and speeches and actions that incite rebellion according to law" and should "earnestly implement various laws and regulations necessary for suppressing the rebellion" that restrict and deprive the people of all freedoms. Chiang Kai-shek has laid the above-mentioned layers of dragnet for the people in the KMT-controlled areas, and still feels it is not enough, and finally stipulated a clause that "in addition to the provisions already stipulated in this outline, in order to achieve the purpose of 'suppressing the rebellion,' the Executive Yuan may issue necessary orders at any time." Observers believe that Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary mobilization outline, which is aimed at people of all classes, will undoubtedly force the people in the entire KMT-controlled area to make more active resistance to survive, thereby forcing a more powerful patriotic democratic movement of the entire nation against Chiang Kai-shek.

　　蒋家公布总动员纲要向人民要钱要粮要命
    【新华社陕北二十日电】据中央社南京讯：蒋介石“国务会议”已于十八日通过所谓“动员戡乱完成宪政实施纲要”，并经全文公布。这个纲要虽写着十八条，但实际上只是一条，就是向蒋管区人民要钱、要粮与要命，并实行血腥恐布，镇压蒋管区人民爱国运动，干净剥夺人民的各种自由。纲要规定可随时向农民及其他阶层勒索粮食、被服、兵役、工役，以供应反革命内战需要，凡回避或拒绝上述勒索者，均“依法惩处”。对于工人，纲要宣布怠工、罢工为“妨碍生产及社会秩序之行为，均应依法惩处”，并限制及管理各业员工的薪俸及工资。对于民间工商金融业界，纲要规定“积极动员（按即征发）”反革命内战所需之煤油、钢铁、药品、运输通讯器材及其他军用物资，“凡规避或妨碍征购、征用者，均依法惩处”。工厂、商店因亏本而停业关厂，亦被称为非法，“依法惩处”。对燃料、纺织、冶炼及有“特别需要”之工矿制造事业，蒋政府对其成品均加以“管理”。对日用品的交易价格、物资流通、资金流通及金融业务，亦均加以限制或管理，并规定将提高税收供应内战。另一方面，动员纲要规定继续举办“国代”及“立委”伪选，以完成所谓“宪政”，这就需要更多的血，更多的牢狱。于是纲要称，“政府对于煽动叛乱之集会及其言论行动，应依法惩处”，应“切实施行戡乱所必需”的限制及剥夺人民一切自由的“各种法令”。蒋贼对蒋管区人民布下了上面的层层天罗地网，还觉不够，最后还规定了一条“除本纲要已有规定者外，为达成‘戡乱’之目的，行政院得随时发布必要之命令”。观察家相信，蒋贼这一向各阶层人民开刀的反革命动员纲要，无疑将逼起全蒋管区人民作死里求生的更积极抗争，从而逼起一更有力的全民族反对蒋贼的爱国民主运动。
