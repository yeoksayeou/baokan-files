    Xinhua News Agency, Huadong Front, 12th: Belated news: A unit of the East China People's Liberation Army, since June 26th, on a front stretching 120 li in the Yimeng Mountains, from Wenyuan (54 li east of Laiwu) in the north to Dagushan (60 li northeast of Mengyin) in the south, fiercely attacked the eastward-advancing Jiang troops along the Lai (Wu)-Xin (Tai)-Meng (Yin) line. After four days and three nights of intense fighting, over 3,000 Jiang soldiers were killed or wounded. On the 27th and 28th, the Jiang troops, with the Fifth Army, the 11th Division, the 25th Division, and the 64th Division advancing in unison, were met with accurate fire from the PLA soldiers upon reaching the pre-arranged positions, suffering heavy casualties. A certain regiment of the PLA, firmly defending the Zhigong Mountain area northeast of Mengyin, repelled more than ten assaults from Jiang troops three times their number, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. The first squad and a machine gun team of the fifth company of a certain regiment, holding the 590-meter high ground northwest of Houjiaguanzhuang, engaged the enemy fiercely for four hours, killing 24 enemy soldiers without a single casualty on our side, earning the title of "Model Blocking Squad." When the PLA completed its mission and was ordered to transfer on the 30th, the Jiang troops still hesitated to advance rashly.

    沂蒙山区恶战四昼夜
    蒋军枉死三千
    新华社华东前线十二日电迟到消息：华东人民解放军一部自上月二十六日起，在沂蒙山区北起汶源（莱芜东五十四里）南迄岱崮（蒙阴东北六十里）长达一百廿里之战线上，痛击莱（芜）新（泰）蒙（阴）一线东犯蒋军，激战四天三夜，毙伤蒋军三千余名。蒋军于二十七、二十八两日，以第五军、整十一师、整二十五师、整六四师等齐头并进，当进至解放军预置阵地，即遭勇士们准确射击，蒙受重创。解放军某团坚守蒙阴东北之志公山一带，杀退三倍于己之蒋军十余次冲锋，敌死伤累累。某团五连一班和一机枪组扼守侯家官庄西北五九○高地与敌激战四小时，杀敌二十四名，我无一伤亡，被誉为阻击模范班。当三十日解放军完成任务奉命转移时，蒋军犹迟迟不敢冒进。
