Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 23rd: According to a United Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 20th, Chiang Kai-shek, accompanied by Gu Zhutong, flew to Kaifeng on the 19th to hold a meeting and discuss military issues. While passing over the Yellow River channel in the Liberated Area, Chiang ordered the pilot to fly low for inspection. It is widely believed that Chiang Kai-shek's flight to Bian was a clear attempt to prepare for the People's Liberation Army's major counter-offensive on the south bank of the Yellow River; the rapid collapse of the Kuomintang defense line in the area has caused Chiang great anxiety. Chiang Kai-shek's sudden interest in the river dikes in the Liberated Areas shows that, at the end of his rope, he is preparing to deploy and implement his long-planned poisonous scheme to breach the dikes.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, July 23rd: The Kuomintang and puppet troops on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, fearing the People's Liberation Army's counter-offensive, have recently been forcibly conscripting road workers and nearby residents to repair the railway and fortifications. Trees within several miles on both sides of the railway have been cut down to be used as railway sleepers. Even small trees that are not yet timber have been affixed with "Confiscated for Public Use" seals. It is also stipulated that a bunker be built every three miles along the road, and deep trenches be dug on the side of the road, in a vain attempt to construct a "solid defense line." However, after the construction, the railway has only been repaired from Xuzhou to the Yunhe Station section, only about one-third of the eastern section of the Longhai line. The workers, unable to bear the beatings, are fleeing in large numbers. The supervisors are also full of pessimism, believing that "road repair is to stabilize people's hearts, so that we can escape quickly when we are defeated." The 755th Regiment of the 28th Division of the Kuomintang army, which originally invaded Zhaoji South, Donghai County, fearing the southward advance of Liu and Deng's army, has retreated north to the Longhai Railway in panic. Local Kuomintang and puppet Zhou and counter-revolutionary cadres in northern Jiangsu have sent their families to Xinpu and Haizhou, preparing to flee.

　　黄河南蒋军防线迅速崩溃
  　蒋介石仓惶飞开封
  　穷途末路准备实行决堤毒计
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】据合众社南京二十日电：蒋介石曾于十九日偕顾祝同飞开封召开会议，商讨军事问题。当时途经解放区黄河流道时，蒋曾命飞行员低飞视察。众信蒋介石此次飞汴，显为企图张罗应付人民解放军在黄河南岸之大反攻；该地蒋军防线之迅速崩溃，已使蒋极为焦虑。蒋介石突对解放区河堤感觉兴趣，显示彼在穷途末路中，正准备部署实行其久已蓄谋之决堤毒计。
    【新华社华中二十三日电】陇海路东段蒋伪军慑于解放军反攻，近来强抓路工及附近居民赶修铁路和工事。铁路两侧数里内树木悉被砍光，充作枕木。未成材的小树，亦被贴上“没收公用”的封条。并规定沿路每三里筑一碉堡，路侧挖掘深沟，妄图构成“坚固防御线”。但修筑迄今，铁路仅由徐州修至运河站一段，仅及陇海东段三分之一。工夫不堪毒打，纷纷逃亡。监工者亦充满悲观情绪，认为“修路是稳稳人心的，打败下来好逃得快。”原由东海县赵集南犯之蒋军二十八师七五五团慑于刘、邓大军南下，已仓惶北退至陇海路。苏北土著蒋伪周逆法干部则纷纷将家属送往新（浦）海（州），预作逃跑之计。
