　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 20th: Comprehensive reports indicate that the glimmer of peace in the Indonesian situation has faded again due to the Netherlands' insistence on its insatiable and unreasonable demands. According to reports, the Sjahrir Cabinet's reply to Van Mook on July 6th can be seen as a concession to the Dutch proposal to organize a temporary federal government. Subsequently, Indonesian Deputy Prime Minister Setyadjit officially declared: "The Dutch proposal will be basically accepted." However, the Dutch reactionaries, with the support of the US and Britain, have become increasingly greedy, so that the issue of so-called "organizing joint constabulary forces to protect Dutch, British and American property" has not yet reached an agreement. Now, a new "ceasefire" proposal has been put forward, demanding that the Indonesian Republic's army "cease fighting" along the demarcation line by midnight on the 16th. However, the Dutch are deploying large-scale new offensives, attempting to sabotage the ongoing negotiations and resolve the Indonesian issue by force. After a full day of meetings on the 16th, the Indonesian Cabinet has rejected the Dutch "ceasefire" proposal and the demand to "organize joint constabulary forces." The Standing Committee of the Indonesian Provisional Parliament has resolved to support the government's measures.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 20th: Moscow Dispatch: Maisky recently wrote an article in the "Red Fleet" newspaper, commenting on the Indonesian situation, stating: In its reply to the Dutch ultimatum, the Indonesian Republic made considerable concessions. However, the Netherlands declared that the Indonesian Republic's reply was unsatisfactory, and therefore intended to sabotage the negotiations. The hidden motive for this attitude of the Netherlands is due to the support of the American reactionaries and their direct interference in Indonesia. The United States has recently interfered directly in Dutch-Indonesian relations twice through diplomatic means, hoping to gain an economic foothold in wealthy Indonesia.

　　荷兰在美英支持下贪得无厌
  　印尼拒绝荷方新要求
    【新华社陕北二十日电】综合报导：因荷兰坚持其贪得无厌的无理要求，印尼局势的和平曙光复归暗淡。据报载，沙利佛丁内阁于七月六日交付樊穆克之复文，可视为对荷方建议组织临时联邦政府照会的一种让步，事后印尼副总理西蒂阿基并正式声明：“荷兰建议将基本上被接受”。但荷兰反动派在美英撑腰下却得寸进尺，致所谓“组织联合宪兵队以保护荷兰英美财产”问题，尚未达到协议。今后提出所谓“停战”的新建议，要求印尼共和国军队须于十六日午夜以前沿划界线“停止作战”。但荷方却部署大规模新的进攻，企图破坏正在进行的谈判，用武力解决印尼问题。印尼内阁经十六日整日会议后，已拒绝荷方之“停战”建议及“组织联合宪兵队”的要求，印尼临时议会常委会决议支持政府这一措施。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】莫斯科讯：迈斯基顷在“红色舰队”报上撰文评印尼局势称：在印尼共和国在答复荷兰最后通牒中，作了相当大的让步。然而，荷兰宣称印尼共和国的复文不能令人满意，因而意图破坏谈判之进行。荷兰此种态度之隐秘动机，系因美国反动派的支持及其直接干涉印尼所致。最近美国两次以外交方式直接干涉荷印关系，希望借此在富庶的印尼获得经济地位。
