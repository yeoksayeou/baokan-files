Deepen Leadership in Border Areas to Promote Emancipation
Wenxian County Selects People's Heroes

[Our Newspaper, Wenxian County News] On June 23rd, our county convened an enlarged meeting of county and district cadres (comrades from district emancipation teams also participated) to summarize the mass movement of the past month and to arrange future work. The method was to first carry out mass-based commendations and evaluations of merit, and then discuss future work. Outstanding heroes at the meeting included Comrade Lü Shuguang of the District Emancipation Team, who worked in Zhang Village on the Yellow River beach in District One, leading the masses to thoroughly overthrow the landlord tyrant, confiscating 446 mu of land. Impoverished peasants and hired laborers all received land, truly achieving the goal of poor peasants and hired laborers running the household. Comrade Lü not only mobilized the poor peasants and hired laborers but also united the middle peasants and armed the masses, creating experiences that promoted the work of the entire district. The conference evaluated his achievements and awarded him a major merit. Another example is Comrade Li Qingxiang, the leader of the basic-level team in Guo Village, District Five. His base was only fifteen or sixteen li away from the enemy in Qinyang, and the villages there were very difficult to work in, but Comrade Li Qingxiang was determined to mobilize the masses, creating an example of simultaneous mobilization, armament, counter-liquidation, and struggle against the enemy.

As a result of the conference's merit evaluation, among the 185 county and district cadres in the county, 15 were awarded major merits, 33 were awarded merits, and 61 received material rewards, with more than 100 cadres in total being recognized for their achievements. A specialized study and discussion was also conducted on the future merit movement throughout the county. In addition to establishing various systems, preliminary standards were set for future merit-making by district cadres: 1. Adhere to the position and stand firm, not be fooled by landlords, and not protect landlords by favoring relatives, friends, or people from one's own village, thus abandoning the peasants. 2. Investigate and research to break through the confused thoughts of the masses, such as "benevolent wealthy people," "conscience," and "fate," and fully mobilize the poor peasants and hired laborers while uniting the broad masses of middle peasants. 3. Cultivate cadres and a large number of activists, arm the poor peasants and hired laborers, and help the masses unearth the landlords' dispersed and hidden land and assets, distributing them fairly to the masses, without buying a single bit for oneself. 4. Contact the masses, unite cadres, adopt a democratic style, and handle matters together as a community. After the meeting, some comrades said: "This time it was really satisfying, everyone knows who's good and who's bad." Everyone's morale is very high.

    深入边沿领导翻身
    温县评选人民功臣
    【本报温县讯】六月二十三日，本县召开了县区扩大干部会议（分区翻身队同志亦参加），总结过去一月群运与布置今后工作，方法上先进行群众性的表功、评功，再讨论今后工作。会上出色的功臣如分区翻身队吕曙光同志，在一区黄河滩张庄工作，领导群众彻底斗倒了地主大奸霸，斗出土地四百四十六亩，赤贫、雇农都得到了土地，真正作到了贫雇当家。吕同志不仅发动了贫雇，团结了中农，还武装了群众，创造出经验推动了全区工作。大会评功结果，记大功一次。又如五区郭村基点小组长李庆祥同志，他那基点距沁阳敌十五六里，那几个村又很难搞，但李庆祥同志却决心发动群众，创造了边发动、边武装、一面进行反倒算、一面对敌斗争的范例。
    经大会评功的结果，全县县区干部一百八十五名中，记大功者十五名，记功者三十三名，物质表扬者六十一名，共计立功者在百名以上。关于今后全县立功运动，也作了专门研究讨论，除建立各种制度外，初步订立了今后区干部立功标准：一、坚持岗位站稳立场，不上地主当，不因亲戚、朋友、本村人自己事而包庇地主丢掉农民。二、调查研究打通群众“善老财”“良心”“命运”等糊涂思想，充分发动贫雇并团结广大中农。三、培养干部和大批积极分子，武装贫雇并帮助群众蹬展地主分散隐藏之土地、内货，公平分配给群众，自己不买一点。四、联系群众、团结干部、作风民主、遇事大家当家。会后有些同志说：“这次可痛快啦，好坏大家都知道”。大家情绪很高。
