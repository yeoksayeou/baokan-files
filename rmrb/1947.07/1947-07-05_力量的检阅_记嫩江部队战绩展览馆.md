　　A Review of Strength
  　Remembering the Exhibition Hall of Achievements of the Nenjiang Troops
    Fang De
    The "Nenjiang" troops under General Liu Bocheng held a week-long exhibition of their achievements in the patriotic self-defense war of the past ten months at the Heroic Model Conference. As I stepped into the Achievement Hall, a chart of battle statistics particularly caught my eye. The chart read: A total of twenty-two major battles were fought, killing and wounding 17,000 Chiang's soldiers; capturing 25,537 alive (including 1,237 officers of general, colonel and lieutenant rank); seizing 3 howitzers, 4 heavy mortars, 10 anti-tank guns, 21 mountain guns, 126 60mm mortars, 73 mortars, 1,209 light and heavy machine guns, 271 grenade launchers, 13,831 rifles, 1,789 howitzer shells, 3,706 mortar shells, 7,366 hand grenades, 1,485,038 rounds of ammunition of various types, 2 tanks, 22 vehicles, 18 radios, and 188 telephones.
    Another major chart marked the troops' movements across the vast plains of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, as well as northern Henan, fighting enemies across the central section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, the central section of the Longhai Railway, and both north and south banks of the Yellow River. They annihilated the mechanized rapid Second Column, the elite of Chiang's direct line, most of the 32nd Regiment of the American-equipped Eleventh Division, part of the Japanese-equipped Third Division, most of the 186th Regiment of Fang Xianjue's Eighty-eighth Division, and a large number of stubborn puppet troops. If we compare the first major battle last year to annihilate Mi Wenhe's 181st Division with the timetable for annihilating the rapid Second Column this year, the former took eight days, while the latter only took one day; in the former, division commander Mi Wenhe escaped, while in the latter, none of the commander, deputy commander, or even the cooks escaped. How proud we should be of the people for having such a rapidly progressing army! Its outstanding battles are all exhibited in categories. I looked at them in this order.
    The photographs vividly depict the Longhai Campaign on August 11th last year, capturing the Luowang Railway Station near Kaifeng, and capturing Song Tielin, the commander of the main regiment of the 181st Division, alive south of the road. They make people feel as if they are there. Next to the photo of Zhang Wenxiao, the hero who led the Eighth Company to maneuver and capture Zhao Xitian during the Dingtao-Caozhou Campaign to annihilate the Third Division, is a short article that reads: "When Zhao Xitian was captured, he deliberately claimed to be the ordnance director." The reporter connected this to the fact that he really didn't understand the Liberation Army's policy on prisoners like Li Shouzheng did. Perhaps he didn't understand because he was the first Chiang's direct line general to be captured alive on this battlefield?!
    Next is the Battle of Longfeng, the first battle to annihilate a complete company of American-equipped direct troops, fought by this unit in Caojiagai near Zhangfengji. Immediately following is the photo exhibition of annihilating the 32nd Regiment at Zhangfengji.
    Looking further, there is the Junan Campaign. The photos of the heroes pulling howitzers in the silt of the Yellow River—that cannon was given by Chiang Kai-shek to the miscellaneous troops of the 119th Brigade to embolden them to attack the Liberated Areas, but it was also captured by us. How exciting is that?! The famous Battle of Shaoerzhai was also fought by this unit; they marched sixty miles by moonlight, penetrated deep into the enemy's heart to fight, and annihilated the enemy.
    In the photo, there is one of a militiaman leading the way, pointing out the direction of the advance, with such a vigilant expression, outlined in just a few strokes.
    In the exhibition room about crossing the Yellow River twice to the south to the Longhai Railway, and capturing four cities in a row in one month, there are two interesting photos: one is of capturing Chengwu City in fifteen minutes, which is faster than an exercise. The commander who directed this operation was also the one who commanded the annihilation of the Rapid Second Column on the front line. The other is of capturing all the local bandits and home-returning corps who had gathered in the city and were settling scores with the people. In the Battle of Wanglou near Chengwu, the Liberation Army rushed from a hundred miles away and captured Zhu Qingchuan, the major general senior advisor of the puppet Zhang Lanfeng, and the personnel of the puppet headquarters directly under him, who had fled into the village just minutes before.
    When I entered the exhibition room for the Battle of Yangzhuang on the outskirts of Yutai, the most striking thing was the display of captured Japanese-style rifles, communication equipment, helmets, clothing, sabers, water bottles... For eight years, Japanese bandits using this equipment had massacred countless compatriots. Today, Chiang Kai-shek is inheriting this legacy to continue massacring the people. Seeing this, it is truly hateful to the extreme.
    Moving forward, I saw the picture of Deputy Regiment Commander Zhang Qinghe, who commanded the Battle of Yangzhuang, holding an emergency meeting of cadres. Below the picture were the following words he said at the time: "I am not just a deputy regiment commander, I am a Communist Party member, and you are also Communist Party members. Whoever loses a corner of a house will be shot, and if I waver, shoot me." With such a commander, what reason do we have not to win? Another picture shows Wu Yongfu, the company commander who was isolated behind enemy lines, shooting the enemies who rushed into their yard with a pistol while encouraging the soldiers, saying, "One person fighting desperately is hard to stop with ten. Listen to my command, Yongfu, and after we go back, I guarantee that everyone will be a hero." How could such heroic spirit not make the visitors stand in awe?
    I turned to a high building and saw a large red silk banner that read: "Learn to seize opportunities and completely annihilate the enemy in the Battle of Dahu Camp." The prelude to this battle was the Defense of Yigou. A main regiment of Chiang's Rapid Second Column, under the cover of several planes and a tank squadron, launched a fierce attack. Our defending forces had only four companies, but Yigou was still ours, and we drove the attacking enemy back. In the picture, this battle also developed according to the actual situation, from the daytime attack and pursuit to the annihilation of eight enemy battalions at Dahu Camp, which was considered a complete annihilation of the enemy. This was something that Chiang Kai-shek really did not expect.
    On a platform was Li Shouzheng's handwritten surrender in a sixteen-page booklet when he was captured. When I walked into the exhibition room of Chiang's puppet documents, I saw a group photo of Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Zhonglian, and the traitor Sun Dianying. According to insiders, this was taken when Chiang Kai-shek went to Xinxiang last year to personally instruct them on how to attack the border region.
    I arrived at the weapons hall and saw that the captured weapons were mostly Japanese and American made. I can't introduce them to the readers one by one, because there are too many. Just to give a few small examples: there are three types of Japanese-style rifles: the Type 38, Type 44, and Type 99. The double-barreled machine gun is one that even the Japanese invaders did not have time to use, but now Chiang Kai-shek is "lucky" to have it. As for other Japanese-style cannons, not to mention. The American-made ones include the No. 1715 chemical cannon (i.e., the mortar, marked with "Chemical Marfire Servicl U.S.A", etc., with a caliber of 4.2 inches, a range of 4,800 meters, a shell weight of 26.5 pounds, and an explosion radius of 120 meters). Another kind of incendiary bomb can burn down all buildings. The American-made mountain gun No. 1048, made in 1942, has a caliber of 75 cm, a range of 8,677.7 meters, a shrapnel weight of 7.24 kg, a effective radius of 100 meters, and a high-explosive shell weight of 6.67 kg, a effective radius of 100 meters, designed for destroying buildings and killing. When I saw the Chinese characters "Made in USA" cast on the butts of various American machine gun and rifle bullets, I thought that American arms factories are openly manufacturing weapons to slaughter the Chinese people for the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. I also thought that Chiang Kai-shek even relies on the United States to supply bullets for machine guns, and he has weakened to such a pitiful extent and is shameless to such a shocking extent. Similarly, this weakness and shamelessness also marks his irretrievable war tragedy.

　　力量的检阅
  　记嫩江部队战绩展览馆
    方德
    刘伯承将军麾下“嫩江”部队在英模大会上，举行十个月来爱国自卫战争战绩的一周展览。我踏进战绩馆里，一幅战绩统计表特别引人注目。表上写着：共历重要战斗二二次，毙伤蒋军官兵一万七千名；生俘二万五千五百三十七名。（内有将校尉级军官一千二百卅七名。）缴获榴弹炮三门，重迫机炮四门，反坦克炮十门，山炮廿一门，六○小炮一百廿六门，迫击炮七十三门，轻重机枪一千二百零九挺，掷弹筒二百七十一个，步枪一万三千八百三十一枝，榴弹炮弹一千七百八十九发，迫击炮弹三千七百零六发，手榴弹七千三百六十六颗，各种子弹一百四十八万五千零三十八发，坦克二辆，汽车二十二辆，电台十八部，电话机一百八十八架。
    另外一幅大事图表上，标志着转战冀鲁豫、豫皖苏及豫北广大平原，打遍平汉中段，陇海中段，黄河南北两岸的敌人。歼灭过蒋家嫡系之嫡系的机械化快速二纵队，美械十一师三十二团大部，日械整三师一部，及方逆先觉八十八师一八六团大部及大量顽伪军。如果以去年歼灭米文和一八一师的首次大战，与今年歼灭快速二纵队的时间表比较，前者八天，后者仅一天，前者跑掉了师长米文和，后者则正副纵队司令官及伙马夫无一漏网。人民有了这样飞跃进步的车队是多么值得骄傲啊！他的出色战斗都分类展览。我是按着这样的序列看下去的。
    去年八月十一日的陇海战役，夺取迫近开封的罗王车站，在路南活捉一八一师主力团团长宋铁林，这些照片写真。都使人如亲临其境。定曹之役歼灭整三师时，我带领第八连机动出击，捉赵锡田的英雄张文孝的照片旁边，贴着一篇小通讯，写着：“当赵锡田被捉住的时候，故意说自己是军械主任。”记者连想到他真不如李守正那样懂得解放军的俘虏政策，其所以不懂，也许因为他还是在这个战场第一个被活捉的蒋家嫡系将领的缘故吧？！
    接着是龙凤之战，这是第一次歼灭美械嫡系一个完整连的战斗，是该部在张凤集附近的曹家垓打的。紧接着便是歼灭三十二团于张凤集的写真。
    再看过去就是鄄南之役，英雄们在淤黄河里拉榴弹炮的照片，那炮是蒋介石拿来给杂牌部队一一九旅进攻解放区壮胆时，结果也被我们缴获了。又是多么使人兴奋啊？！有名的邵耳寨战斗也是这个部队打的；他们乘着月夜六十里进军，深入敌人心脏进行战斗，而且歼灭了敌人。
    在写真画里，有一幅是民兵带路指点进军方向，多么机警的神情，几笔就勾画出来了。
    在二次跨过黄河南下陇海路，一月连克四城的展览室里有两件有趣的写真：一是十五分钟登上城武城，这比演习还快。指挥这次作战的也就是消灭快速二纵队时在第一线指挥作战的某司令员，另一个是捉光了堆聚在城里的伪顽地方土匪和倒算人民的还乡团。城武附近王楼之战，解放军是从百里以外赶去的，一举活捉先几分钟逃入该村的伪张岚峰的少将高级参议祝晴川及随其逃窜的伪总部直属机关人员。
    当我进入鱼台外围杨庄之战的展览室里，最刺目的是陈列着缴获的日式步枪、通讯器材、钢盔、衣服、战刀、水瓶……………，八年以来用这些装备的日本强盗不知屠杀了多少祖国同胞。而今天蒋介石又继承这样的遗产来继续屠杀人民，看到这里。真令人痛恨已极。
    再往前我便看见了指挥杨庄战斗的张副团长庆和。召开干部紧急会议的画面，画下面写了他当时这样几句话：“我不只是副团长，我是个共产党员，你们也是共产党员，谁丢掉一个屋角，就枪毙谁，我动摇了就枪毙我。”我们有了这样的指挥员有什么理由不能胜利呢？另一幅是被隔离在敌人阵地后面的连长吴永富，他提着手枪一面射击扑进他们院里的敌人，一面激励战士说：“一人拼命、十人难挡，听我永富指挥，回去以后，我保证你们人人当英雄”。这样豪迈的英雄气概，怎能不使参观者们肃然起敬呢？
    我转上一座高楼，看见一幅大红绸上写着：“学习抓紧战机，彻底歼灭敌人的大胡营战斗”。这个战斗的序幕是宜沟保卫战，蒋军快速二纵队一个主力团在数架飞机及一个坦克中队掩护下猛烈冲锋，我守军只有四个连，但宜沟终是我们的，把进攻的敌人打回去了，在画面上，这个战斗也是按照实际情况发展下去的，由白天进攻追击只画到大胡营聚歼了他们八个营的兵力，才算把敌人歼灭干净了。这实在是蒋介石想不到的事。
    在一个平台上放着李守正被俘时草写的十六开本的投降书，当我走进蒋伪文件展览室里，看见蒋介石王仲廉和汉奸孙殿英的合影，据熟悉内幕的人说：这是蒋介石去年到新乡布置进攻边区对他们面授机宜时合摄的。
    我到了武器馆，看到缴获的武器中以日本式和美国造最多，我不能一类一类介绍给读者，因为太多了，仅举几个小例子来说：日式的步枪即有三八式、四四式、九九式三种，双铳（即双筒）机枪是连日本强盗自己都来不及用的，现在蒋介石却“幸运的”拿出来了。至于其它日式炮更不用说了。美式的有一七一五号化学炮（即臼炮名重迫击炮上面注有“Ｃｈｅｍｉｃａｌ　Ｍａｒｆｉｒｅ　Ｓｅｒｖｉｃｌ　Ｕ·Ｓ·Ａ”等字样，口径四点二英寸，射程四八○○公尺，弹重二六点五磅，爆炸弹威力圈半径一二○公尺。另一种燃烧弹可以烧着一切建筑物。一九四二年造的美式山炮号码一○四八，口径七五公分，射程八六七七点七公尺，榴霰弹重七点二四公斤，威力圈直径一百公尺，榴弹重六点六七公斤，威力圈直径一百公尺，专作破坏建筑物及杀伤之用。当我看到各种美式机枪步枪使用的子弹屁股上都铸有中文“美造”两个字时，我想到美国军火工厂，竟公开为卖国贼蒋介石制造屠杀中国人民的武器，也想到蒋介石连机步枪上用子弹也靠美国来供给，他竟已衰弱到这样可怜的程度，无耻到这样可惊的程度了。同样，这种衰弱与无耻也正标志着他不可挽救的战争悲剧。
