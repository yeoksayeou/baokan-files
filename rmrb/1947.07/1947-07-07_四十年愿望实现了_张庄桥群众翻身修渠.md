　　Forty Years of Wishes Realized
  　Zhangzhuang Bridge Masses Overturn and Repair Canal
    [Our Newspaper] More than forty years ago, on the small road east to Zuoxi in Zhangzhuang Bridge Village, Handan, the masses wanted to dig a ditch to irrigate the land on both sides. The landlord, Pei Laojie, because it had to pass through his land, and secondly because the landlords preferred lean years (as during such times) the poorer the poor were, the more resourceful the landlords became. He said, "Three years of good harvest are not as good as one year of famine; if the land doesn't yield, the family will prosper." Therefore, he didn't allow digging, and the masses had no way. After the masses overturned, this year the government advocated digging communication channels to fight drought and prepare for famine. Four hundred people from the entire village gathered, and the troops stationed in the village voluntarily helped with forty laborers. They started work after breakfast on the 20th, and in less than a day, a ditch more than two li long was completed. Village cadres Du Yushan, Zhang Jilin, and others worked very hard; Du Yushan shouted himself hoarse. On the third day, the river water rose and the canal water flowed out of the ditch. The eastern land was watered from above, and the rest was watered by the masses splashing water. In two days, ten qing of dry land had all been turned into paddy fields. The masses' forty-year-old wish, suppressed by the landlord and unable to be realized, has now been fulfilled. The masses are all happily producing in the fields, saying, "If it weren't for the Communist Party, the landlord wouldn't have allowed us to dig this ditch; they wouldn't care whether the masses lived or died!" After the completion of the Zhangzhuang Bridge ditch, villages such as Sandi and Beizhangzhuang have seen a surge in the enthusiasm for digging ditches. A ditch between the north of Zhangzhuang Bridge Village and the south of Sandi Village is being dug jointly by the two villages. It has already started. This ditch is two li long and will irrigate a total of eight qing of land. To the south of Beizhangzhuang and Guo Village, the two villages also want to dig a ditch and are currently planning it.

　　四十年愿望实现了
  　张庄桥群众翻身修渠
    【本报讯】邯郸张庄桥村东去左西的小路上，四十多年前，群众就愿意挖一道沟，灌溉两旁土地，地主裴老介因为要通过他的地，其次便是地主都愿意过荒年，穷人越穷地主越有办法，他说：“丰收三年不如一年歉，地里不收家里发”，所以他不让挖，群众就没有办法。群众翻身后，今年政府提倡挖沟通渠抗旱备荒，全村群众集合四百人，本村驻防之部队自动帮工四十人，于二十日早饭后动工，不到一天，二里多长一条沟已告完竣。村干杜玉善、张吉林等很卖力气，杜玉善把嗓子都喊哑了。第三天河水上涨渠水出沟，东面土地自上水，其余均由群众泼水，两天功夫，十顷旱地已全部变成水田。四十年群众的志愿，被地主压着不能实现，现在完成了，群众均欢天喜地在地里生产，都说：“若不是共产党来，地主就不让挖这条沟，群众死活人家管哩！”张庄桥挖沟竣工后，三堤、北张庄诸村，已兴起挖沟的热潮，张庄桥村北三堤村南一条沟，两村伙挖，已经动工，此沟长二里，共浇八顷地。北张庄郭村两村村南，也要挖一道沟，现正在计划中。（邯郸群众报）
