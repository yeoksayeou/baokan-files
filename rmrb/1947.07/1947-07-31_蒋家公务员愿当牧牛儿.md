　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 29th: When a certain unit of the Inner Mongolia Self-Defense Army attacked Chiang bandit troops in the Eastern Khoshuun of the Zhelimu League, they captured a complaint written by a Chiang Kai-shek civil servant. The text reads: "Civil servants shed tears endlessly, never idle from morning till night; even busier on Sundays, feet swollen, shoes worn through, suffering cold, hunger, and rain. Payday is even more unbearable; after a month's salary is distributed, after deducting meal expenses, only a thousand yuan remain. Thinking of the old parents and young children at home, enduring hunger day and night, debts to the east, debts to the west, who cares about a small clerk like you? Grit your teeth, swear an oath, use this as a lesson for your children; rather be a cowherd, never be a civil servant!"

　　蒋家公务员愿当牧牛儿
    【新华社东北二十九日电】内蒙古自卫军某部在哲盟东科后旗向蒋匪出击时，缴获蒋记公务员诉苦文一件。文云：“公务员泪涟涟，白日到晚不得闲；星期日，更加忙，脚发肿，鞋底穿，寒饥冷雨苦辛酸。领薪日，更难堪，一月薪水分到手，扣尽饭费剩千元，想起家中父母老少昼夜枵腹忍饥寒，东家债，西家欠，谁家管你小职员。咬牙关，发誓愿，儿女用以为殷鉴；宁为牧牛儿，千万别做公务员！”
