Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 10th. A spokesperson for the East China Field Army Headquarters recently issued a statement on the victory of the Feixian campaign, as follows:

As Chiang Kai-shek continues to suffer defeats on battlefields across the country, with the overall military situation trending toward collapse, he continues to launch a desperate "key offensive" on the East China battlefield, attempting to salvage his inevitable doom. Our army's victory at Feixian, in which the entire 38th Brigade of the reorganized 59th Division was annihilated, delivers a painful blow to those engaging in desperate struggles. The victory of the Feixian campaign is the beginning of Chiang Kai-shek's most disastrous offensive defeat on the East China battlefield. Chiang Kai-shek's offensive began on June 25th. He scraped together every possible army. Aside from the four reorganized divisions – the 7th, 48th, 83rd, and 28th – along the Linyi-to-Donghai line, which were waiting for an opportunity to move, the front line from Laiwu via Xintai to Mengyin, spanning 120 li from north to south, was packed with nine reorganized divisions: the 5th, 85th, 25th, 11th, 75th, 64th, 65th, 9th, and 57th. Added to this were the 96th, 8th, and 54th armies (unreorganized) operating in coordination on the Jiaoji Railway line. The total strength of the first-line troops reached twelve reorganized divisions, approximately 400,000 men. This is the most powerful force Chiang Kai-shek has used in a single offensive against the Liberated Areas. Simultaneously, he was particularly careful and cautious in tactics, advancing in a coordinated manner and consolidating his positions. On the other hand, he also acted with extraordinary madness, using planes and artillery to bombard every hill, regardless of ammunition costs. Our heroic and powerful East China People's Liberation Army, adhering to the policy of annihilating the invading Chiang troops in East China, continuously inflicted firm resistance and casualties on the enemy. Even the struggle for every hill and ridge forced Chiang's troops to pay a heavy price. Consequently, although Chiang's offensive has lasted for two weeks, the furthest advance has been no more than 80 or 90 li, averaging only a few li per day. At the northern and southern Daigu, Longxu Gu, and Ban Gu, our guarding troops still stand tall, powerfully situated on the flanks and rear of the invading Chiang troops. Chiang's troops can only bypass them from a distance, sighing at the mountains, fearing the strongholds, and worrying about repeating the fate of the 74th Division. At this time, a part of our Liberation Army, with the momentum of a divine army descending from the sky, swept across 150 li of the Linyi-Mengyin highway, dividing Chiang's First and Third Army Groups, advancing into Chiang's flanks and rear, and directly approaching Feixian, the central city of southern Shandong. From July 1st to 7th, after a week of fierce fighting, the entire defending Chiang army brigade was annihilated, liberating Feixian city and the surrounding vast areas. Following closely on the heels of the Feixian victory, how the East China People's Liberation Army will realize its established plan to completely crush Chiang Kai-shek's largest offensive, and how General Liu Bocheng's hundreds of thousands of victorious troops will unleash their thunderous power, will be explained in the continuous good news in the future. However, here we hope that the miscellaneous troops generals and soldiers who are being driven by Chiang Kai-shek as tools of civil war should awaken immediately. The reorganized 59th Division's 38th Brigade, which was annihilated in the Feixian campaign, belongs to Feng Zhi'an's Northwest-based 33rd Army (formerly a group army). This army went through the Great Wall, Lugou Bridge, and Taierzhuang battles during the War of Resistance Against Japan, achieving considerable results. However, its current equipment and treatment are not even as good as that of the puppet army-turned-traffic police. The entire army is organized into eight regiments, which is not even comparable to one full reorganized division (nine regiments) of Chiang's direct lineage troops. This time, the 38th Brigade was trapped in Feixian city, fighting fiercely for seven days, while the Chiang troops in Linyi and Mengyin, which could have reached Feixian in a day, stood idly by, listening to the sounds of artillery fire, happily letting the brigade repeat the fate of the Sichuan Army's reorganized 72nd Division in Tai'an. This fact once again proves that it is possible to seek refuge with the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and become one of the "Four Great Protectors". Relying on the traitor Chiang Kai-shek to preserve one's strength is impossible. Only by turning to the masses of the people and breaking away from the civil war can one find the path of brightness. Those who understand the times are heroes. Miscellaneous brand generals and soldiers, please carefully consider these words!

### 我军费县之捷  乃敌攻势惨败的开始  华东解放军总部发言人纵谈战局

    我军费县之捷
    乃敌攻势惨败的开始
    华东解放军总部发言人纵谈战局
    【新华社华东前线十日电】华东野战军总部发言人，顷就费县战役之捷，发表谈话如下：
    蒋介石在全国战场连吃败仗，整个军事形势日趋崩溃之际，继续对华东战场发动垂死挣扎的“重点进攻”，企图挽救其必败的命运。而我军费县之捷，已全歼灭整五十九师三十八旅，而予垂死挣扎者以痛击。费县战役的胜利，就是蒋介石在华东战场上最大一个攻势惨败的开始，蒋介石的这一攻势，开始于六月廿五日，他拚凑了一切可能拚凑的军队，除了以临沂到东海一线的七、四十八、八十三和廿八等四个整编师待机蠢动不算外，从莱芜经新泰到蒙阴南北一百廿里的正面一线，就堆着五、八十五、廿五、十一、七十五、六十四、六十五、九和五十七，九个整编师。加上胶济线上东西配合夹击的九十六、八和五十四等三个军（未整编），总计第一线的兵力，即达十二个整编师，约四十万人之众。这是蒋介石进攻解放区在一次攻势中所用的空前强大的兵力。同时在战术上，特别小心谨慎，齐头并进，稳扎稳打。另一方面，又表现得格外疯狂，对每一山头，都以飞机大炮不惜弹药的大肆轰炸。我英勇强大的华东人民解放军，秉全力歼灭进犯华东蒋军的方针，不断予敌以坚强阻击和杀伤，虽一岗一岭的争夺，也迫使蒋军付出浩大代价。因而蒋军进攻，迄今虽已两周，而前进最多的也不过八、九十里，平均日行数里。而在南北岱崮、龙须崮、板崮等处，我守崮部队仍巍然雄踞进犯蒋军的侧后，蒋军至今只能绕道远避，隔山奂叹，望崮生畏，而惶惶于重蹈七十四师覆辙。此时，我解放军一部以奇兵天降之势，横扫临沂、蒙阴公路一五○里，分割蒋军一、三两兵团，挺进蒋军侧背，直逼鲁南中心之费县城下。自七月一日至七日经一周激战，将守城蒋军整旅全部歼灭，解放费县城及周围广大地区。紧接费县之捷，我华东人民解放军将如何实现其既定计划，以彻底粉碎蒋介石此次最大的攻势，与夫刘伯承将军数十万常胜军将如何发挥其雷霆万钧的威力，可于今后连续的捷报中说明。不过我们在此希望被蒋介石驱使当作内战工具的杂牌军将士们，应该立刻觉悟。此次费县之役被歼的整五十九师卅八旅，是西北系三十三军（原集团军）冯治安的部队。该军在抗日战争中，历经长城、芦沟桥、台儿庄诸役，颇著战绩。然其今日之装备待遇，尚不及伪军出身之交通警察。全军编制共八个团，尚不及蒋嫡系军之一个整骗师（九个团）。此次，该部三十八旅困守费县城，苦战七天，而一日可达费县之临沂与蒙阴蒋军，则按兵不动，坐闻炮声，乐令该旅重踏川军整七十二师在泰安之命运。这一事实，又一次证明投靠卖国贼蒋介石当四太保是可能的。投靠卖国贼蒋介石借以保存实力，是不可能的。只有转到人民大众方面，脱离内战，才是光明正道。识时务者为俊杰，杂牌将士请三审斯言！
