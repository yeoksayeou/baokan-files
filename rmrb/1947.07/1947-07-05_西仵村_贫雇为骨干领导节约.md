　　Xiwu Village
    Poor and Hired Peasants as Backbone Lead in Thrift
    [Report from Li Cheng by our newspaper] In response to the call for production and thrift to prevent drought and prepare for famine, the entire Xiwu Village, with poor and hired peasants as the backbone, launched a production and thrift movement after discussions. Ninety-eight households of poor and hired peasants immediately joined the movement. Wang Taiyi's group, consisting of nine households and fourteen laborers, were newly emancipated poor tenant farmers who had recently moved from Xijing Mountain to Xiwu Village. They proposed the slogans: "Mix bran in grain to save food for the famine!" and "Gather more wild vegetables to replace millet to save food to satisfy hunger!" Under these action slogans, all nine households in the group, with seventy mu of wheat, in addition to actively participating in wheat harvesting, also dedicated two laborers to open a production mutual aid shop. All nine women fully went to the fields to rush the wheat harvest, collecting a total of one stone and eight dou of wheat. While other mutual aid teams ate noodles at noon and sent snacks in the afternoon during wheat harvesting and ate collectively, this group, in order to save, collectively did the work of harvesting wheat, with each person eating at their own home. At noon, they still ate rice, but there were no snacks in the afternoon. Women picked up wheat and gathered wild vegetables. In the morning, it was millet mixed with bran and wild vegetables, and in the evening, it was wild vegetable porridge. From June 13th to the 23rd, within ten days, statistics showed that each person had saved half a jin of millet per day, and the entire group of thirty-six people had saved one hundred and eighty jin of millet. Under the positive production and thrift promotion influence of Wang Taiyi's group, emancipated peasant Ma Sannv also started to economize, getting up early every day to spin thread and gather wild vegetables, mixing vegetables and bran into the grain flour, saving half a jin of rice a day, and promoting Liu Chongsheng and others to join the thrift movement one after another.

    贫雇为骨干领导节约
    【本报黎城讯】一区西仵村响应生产节约防旱备荒号召，全村以贫雇为骨干经过座谈后，九十八户贫雇即首先卷入了生产节约运动中。王太义组九户，十四个劳力，他们都是新翻身的贫佃户，新从西井山上移居到西仵村，提出“粮食要搅糠，省下粮食来渡荒！”“多采野菜顶小米，省下粮食来充饥！”在这行动口号下，全组九户，麦七十亩，除自己积极参加割麦外，还抽出两个劳力开了一个生产互助店，九个妇女完全上地抢麦，共拾麦一石八斗，别的互助组割麦是晌午面，半晌送点心，集体吃饭，他组为了节约是互助组集体做活割麦，各人在各人家里吃饭，晌午同样也是吃米饭，半晌没干粮，妇女拾麦捎采野菜，早晨是小米搅糠配野菜，晚上是野菜配稀饭。从六月十三号开始，到二十三号十天内统计，每人每天已节省小米半斤，全组三十六个人已节省小米一百八十斤。在王太义组的积极生产节约推动影响下，接着有翻身农民马三女也节约起来，每天起早纺线捎采野菜，谷面里搅菜并搅糠，一天节约半斤米，并推动刘崇生等也先后卷入了节约运动。（范任卿）
