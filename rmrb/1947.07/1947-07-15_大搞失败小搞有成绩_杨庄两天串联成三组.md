    Big Efforts Fail, Small Efforts Succeed
    Yangzhuang Forms Three Mutual Aid Groups in Two Days Through Door-to-Door Visits
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] On June 25th, Yangzhuang in the Third District of Nanhe County held a villagers' meeting, calling for production mutual aid. In a short time after the meeting, more than 30 mutual aid groups were organized. Later, upon inspection, it was discovered that the masses saw the leadership emphasizing the importance of production mutual aid and were afraid that they would not be able to avoid joining a mutual aid group. Thus, they formed "father-son soldier" groups (groups composed of fathers, sons, uncles, and nephews) and used old-fashioned plows with few mutual aid practices to deal with official business from higher authorities. Later, after discussion, the idea of "dealing with official business" was broken, and the method of using activists and village cadres as the backbone to make door-to-door visits was adopted. In two days, three groups were formed. The members of these three groups were all liberated peasants with backbones. These three groups played the role of a locomotive in the production of Yangzhuang Village. (Nanhe Small Newspaper)

    大搞失败小搞有成绩
    杨庄两天串联成三组
    【本报讯】南和三区杨庄六月二十五日召开村民大会，号召生产互助。会后不大的时间即有三十多个互助组组织了起来，后来一检查，才知道群众是看领导上说生产互助重要的很，怕不参加互助组不行，才成立了父子兵组（父子叔侄组成一组）和将过去少有互助的葛犋（两家伙使牲口），来应付上级公事。后来经过讨论，打破公事思想，改用以积极分子和村干作骨干去串联的方式，在两天中就串联成了三组，这三组成份都是翻身农民，都有骨干，这三组在杨庄村生产中起了火车头的作用。（南和小报）
