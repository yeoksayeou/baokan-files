　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 8th: The Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region Headquarters announced on "July 7th" the victorious development and main achievements of the patriotic self-defense war over the past year, from July of last year to the end of June this year, stating: Over the past year, our field army and local forces have gradually shifted from defense to counter-offensive, gaining the initiative in the war. After the Yi-Shu campaign in November last year, the war turned into a seesaw battle. Between December of last year and January of this year, we had already begun local counter-attacks in Mancheng and the southern Baoding area, recovering Wangdu, Dingxian, and other places. By early April this year, when our summer offensive began, we launched a large-scale attack on the Zhengtai Railway, the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, and the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, and our army completely seized the initiative. As our army swept along the Zhengtai line, Sun Lianzhong hastily gathered four divisions (brigades) of troops in Baoding, but still did not dare to provide southern support. In mid-June, our army simultaneously launched attacks on the Cang (County) Qing (Qing) area in the northern section of the Jinpu Railway and the Xu (Shui) Yi (County) area north of Baoding, causing Chiang's troops, including Sun Lianzhong's units, to frantically move between the Beining and Pinghan lines following our army's movements, unable to reverse their decline.
    According to incomplete statistics: In the past year, our field army and local forces have fought a total of 3,364 battles, annihilating the equivalent of six brigades and two regiments of Chiang's regular army (not including those annihilated below the battalion level), annihilating a total of sixteen full regiments of Chiang's local forces and puppet troops, and all of the fifth detachment of Japanese troops retained by Yan Xishan of Shanxi. The above statistics include: 83,576 Chiang and puppet troops killed or wounded, including two major generals and below, and 116,130 captured alive, including two major generals and below. Seized a total of 971 various artillery pieces, including 1 howitzer, 4 railway guns, 11 mortars, 34 mountain guns, 11 flat trajectory guns, 21 anti-tank guns, and 29 rocket launchers. 482 heavy machine guns; 3,846 light machine guns, 14 automatic rifles, 1,515 submachine guns, over 90,000 rifles and carbines, 1,616 grenade launchers, over 94,000 artillery shells of various types, over 428,000 rounds of ammunition, 84 radio stations, 1,448 telephones, 1 armored train, 4 armored vehicles, 83 vehicles, shot down 4 enemy aircraft, 19 tanks, and 63 trains. Recovered and liberated a total of 39 county towns. A total of 36 county towns were occupied by Chiang and the puppets, almost all of which fell between July and November of last year, and most of them have now been recovered.
