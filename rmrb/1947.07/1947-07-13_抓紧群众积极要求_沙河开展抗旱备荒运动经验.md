    Grasping the Positive Demands of the Masses: Shahe's Experience in Launching a Drought Resistance and Famine Preparation Movement
    In mid-June, the area west of Cejing in the second district of Shahe and the area around Dukou in the first district received several small rains. West of Cejing, the rain had soaked through, but Cejing Village only had about two fingers' worth of rain, and areas east of it had none. Dukou also only had about three fingers of rain. Except for the villages where the rain had soaked through and where planting was widespread, these semi-dry villages also entered a rush-planting movement. Initially, the ideological concerns of the masses who were afraid of wasting their efforts and not daring to plant were addressed. For example, the masses in Dukou Village said, "The plot is too small, and even if we plant, nothing will come up; harrowing the land is enough." The masses in Beigou Village said, "Spring land can be planted, but wheat stubble land is no good," reflecting ideological obstacles such as planting without harvest. Labor heroes in each village played a leading role in breaking down the masses' ideological obstacles and in rush-planting. For example, Cejing labor hero Li Laotan said, "Whether it comes up or not is up to it; whether we sow or not is up to us." Gao Dong said, "Planting gives hope; not planting guarantees nothing; even if it doesn't come up, we won't regret it." An old man from Beigou Village said, "Wheat stubble land may not sprout evenly, so sow it thickly; a large part will still come up; even if we have to replant some, it will still be less work than carrying water to plant!" Thus, under the slogans "Better to lose the seed than waste the land," "See seedlings, get thirty percent of the harvest," and "Planting gives hope; not planting guarantees nothing," action began. Under the leadership of labor hero Liu Qingyun, Dukou Village rush-planted 825 mu in less than three days. Cejing Village had many people, and everyone pitched in. When there weren't enough seed drills and harrows, they borrowed them from villages that hadn't received rain. Some used long benches instead, turning the benches upside down and tying ropes to the legs to pull them. Businesses also all stopped operating and joined the rush-planting movement. Sixty businesses rush-planted 1,800 mu in one day. In Cejing, Beigou, and other villages, male laborers operated the seed drills, while women and children helped with the drills and planted beans, and semi-laborers pulled the drills. In the rush-planting in Balimiao, in order to save more time, Fan Guangen and Fan Yinbao's groups alternated planting different directions of land to save round trips. Dukou Village used the method of moving the land but not the plot (first planting a patch north of the village and then planting a patch south of the village), which saved time. These villages generally achieved full village mutual assistance and mobilization, and gave priority to planting for the families of revolutionary soldiers. According to incomplete statistics from Dukou, Cejing, Balimiao, and Beigou villages, a total of 12,985 mu of land was rush-planted. Around June 20th, these villages received another two or three fingers of rain, and the seedlings all survived.
    The first half of the first and second districts, and the third, fourth, and fifth districts, are dry land (the third, fourth, and fifth districts each have a small portion of irrigated land), and have not received rain since then. Although some cotton was planted in the previous stage of the drought resistance struggle, it did not form a broad mass movement. The masses and cadres still have the idea of waiting for rain and relying on Heaven for food. For example, at a meeting of cadres in the fourth district, it was said, "It's not too late to plant millet if it rains in another half month; if it rains in June, we can still plant buckwheat and small vegetables!" "One hundred li cannot be without villages" (meaning it cannot not rain for a long time), "We are all dry land here, how can we fight drought? The sixth and seventh districts are irrigated land; let them fight it!" At a meeting of village cadres in the third district, it was said, "Drought in May doesn't count as drought; if it rains continuously in June, we'll have enough to eat; it's only May now, what are you worried about? After harvesting buckwheat and vegetables, the whole year still depends on it; abundant rabbits mean lean years for fish (abundant means good years). There are many rabbits this year, so it's guaranteed to be a good year." Someone in the fourth district said, "If the first half of the year is so dry that the seedlings can't stand it, the second half of the year will surely have a good harvest of radishes and vegetables." In short, the masses were resisting the issue of drought resistance in their thinking in various ways. Based on these ideas, the leadership in various places organized the masses to recall the suffering of past famine years. Hou Erhui, the village chief of Houjia Village in the fourth district, said, "That year, during the famine, we had nothing to eat at home. I took my children to Shimen. We ate excrement, and couldn't defecate, so we used sticks to dig it out. Later, we still had nothing to eat, so I made the cruel decision to sell my child." Wang Gaichao, a labor hero from Nan Zhang, said, "That year, I bought 'jili' (a type of wild fruit) to eat for 25 yuan a 'dou' (unit of volume). I cheated someone out of 100 yuan to buy 'jili' to eat, and in May, I gave him two 'dou' of wheat." Song Zhiwen, a labor hero from Zhang Village, talked about how his wife was so hungry during the famine that she couldn't move on the ground, and the children had no milk to drink, so he gave two children away to others in exchange for five 'jin' (unit of weight) of bran. As he spoke, he was about to cry. After reflecting, everyone said, "We can't forget the pain after the knife has been pulled out; we must start preparing early!" Fan Shen hero Han Xinyuan said, "In the past, the landlords only thought about getting through the famine; the more famine years there were, the richer they got. We can't learn from them!" Wang Gaichao said, "This year, the weather is dry and only windy, just like in the ninth year of the Republic of China. That year, it was just windy and didn't rain. Even if it rained a little, it would dissipate before it soaked the ground." Tian Zeng's father (an old man) from Xiaqu Village said, "I've learned from this experience. In the 26th year of Guangxu, it was May, and it hadn't rained yet. Everyone said, 'No amount of money can buy a dry May; continuous rain in June means enough to eat.' I thought it wouldn't be too late if it rained in June, but it didn't rain in early June. I thought it would be okay to plant early-maturing crops if it rained in mid-June, but it didn't rain then either. By the end of June, we could still plant buckwheat and vegetables. We waited and waited until July, and it rained continuously for 20 days. We didn't plant anything, and many people starved to death that year. I've learned my lesson!" The leadership (the above was all about the fourth district) seized these issues and called on the cadres in each village to perform meritorious service for the people in drought resistance and famine relief, and launched a mass-based campaign to record and commend achievements. This changed everyone's above-mentioned negative thinking, and everyone said, "If we put the same enthusiasm we had into land reform and joining the army last year into drought resistance, are we still afraid of not doing it well?" So they all started thinking in a positive way. Those who could repair wells tried their best to expand the area of irrigated land. Those who couldn't did their best to harvest part of the crop early and carry water to plant part of it, and vigorously organized weaving and transportation to exchange for grain and vegetables. The leadership also put forward the following slogans: "One mu of garden can be as good as ten mu of field; mutual aid in well-digging is not difficult," "Think back to the famine years; wives and children separated, it's truly pitiful," "Dry-sow land and weeds; the seedlings will grow well," "Eat more vegetables, eat more bran, save on every meal," "Throw away the husks now, and you'll starve later," "Rather eat a half meal than go without," "Don't be afraid, don't be complacent, prepare and you'll be fine." The cadres in each village formulated drought resistance and famine preparation plans, totaling 70 wells to be dug or old wells to be repaired in 26 villages, and 4,059 mu of shaded land to be planted according to the seedlings. 9,100 mu of corn and beans were to be planted by carrying water (ten villages), 30 mu of sweet potatoes were to be planted by carrying water, and 2,123 mu of land were to be dry-sown. In addition to leading all the women to weave an average of two ounces of cloth per day, the women cadres also managed to save two ounces of rice per person per day, and make sure to dig up wild vegetables and eat more bran. In addition, they would plow more dry land. If it rained, two fingers of rain would be as good as four fingers. The dry land should first be plowed into ditches, and when it rained, the seedlings should be planted in the ditches.
    This movement has two points of experience: First, to open up thinking, it is necessary to convene mass meetings, seize the positive thinking of the masses who are eager to plant seedlings, and say that planting a seedling a day earlier will yield more than planting it a day later. Then the momentum will quickly build up. Second, in action, labor heroes, cadres, and activists played a leading role. As soon as the masses saw someone start, they became envious. Especially this year, with the prolonged drought and no rain, the desire to plant seedlings was urgent, so as soon as someone planted, everyone followed suit and quickly formed a movement.

    抓紧群众积极要求  沙河开展抗旱备荒运动经验
    六月中旬沙河二区册井以西和一区渡口一带，都先后下了几次小雨。册井以西已经下透，而册井村就只有二指多雨，以东就没有下。渡口也只下了三指雨，除了下透雨的村庄普遍下种外，这些半干不湿的村庄也都进入了抢种运动。开始是先打通了群众怕白费劲不敢种的思想顾虑，如渡口村群众说：“垧太小，种上也出不来，耙地还可以。”北沟村群众说：“春地能种，麦茬不行”，有强种不收等思想障碍。各村劳动英雄在打破群众思想障碍和抢种中都起了带头作用。如册井劳英李老谈说：“出不出在它，耩不耩在咱”。高东的说：“种上有想望，不种指不上，不出来也不后悔”。北沟村一个老头说：“麦茬地怕出不齐种稠些，总要出一大部哩，就是补点也比担水点种省工哩！”于是便在“能叫丢了籽，不叫搭了垧”，“见苗三分收”“种上有想望，不种指不上”的口号下行动起来。渡口村在劳动英雄刘清云的带领下，不到三天时间，抢种了八百二十五亩。册井村人多，都下了手，耧耙不够用，便到未落雨村庄去借用。有的用长凳子顶用，把板凳放倒，用绳拴住腿拉。商号也全部停止营业，卷入了抢种运动，六十户商家一天抢种一千八百多亩。册井、北沟等村都是男劳力捉耧，妇女儿童帮耧点豆，半劳力拉耧。八里庙在抢种中为了更节省时间，范光恩和范银保两组换不同方向之地都省来回跑道。渡口村是移地不移垧（先把村北一片种完再种村南的），这样都节省了时间，这些村一般都作到了全村大互助和大动员，并且是先给抗属种。根据渡口、册井、八里庙和北沟四村不完全统计，共抢种了一万二千九百八十五亩地，这些村在六月二十前后又下了二三指雨，小苗都捉住了。
    一、二区的前半部和三、四、五区是旱地（三、四、五区都各有一小部水地），而至今又未落过雨，虽然在前一段抗旱斗争中点种了一部棉花，但未形成广大群众性的运动。群众干部的等天下雨和靠天吃饭思想还是存在着，如四区干部会上说：“再有半月下雨种谷子还不算晚，六月里下了雨，还能种荞麦小菜哩！”“不能一百里地没村”（不能长期不下雨的意思），“咱们这里都是旱地，怎样和旱灾斗争呢？六、七区是水地，让他们斗吧！”三区村干部会上说：“五月旱不算旱，六月连阴吃饱饭，现在才入五月呀，你着啥急呢？收了荞麦菜，年景还全在，丰广兔子歉年鱼（丰广就是好年景）。今年兔子多，保险是好年景。”四区有人说：“前半年旱的按不住苗，后半年一定好收萝葡菜。”总之群众是在各方面的思想上抵触着抗旱问题。根据这些思想，各处领导上都组织了群众回想过去灾荒年的痛苦。四区侯家庄村长侯二会说：“那年灾荒家里没吃的，领上孩子到石门，吃的赖，屙不下屎来用棍扣剜，后来仍没吃的，下了狠心卖孩子”。南掌劳英王改朝说：“那年买疾梨吃，二十五元一斗，我揭了人家一百元钱买疾梨吃，到五月给了人家二斗麦子。”掌村劳英宋智文谈起灾荒年老婆饿的躺在地下不能动，孩子没奶吃，把两个小孩给了人家，换回五斤糠来，说着就想掉泪。反省以后大家说：“咱们不能拔了刀子忘了疼，可要早早下手准备啦！”翻身英雄韩新元说：“过去老财光想过荒，越年过荒年他们越富，咱可不能学习他们呀！”王改朝说：“今年天旱光刮风，又和民国九年一样，那年就是光刮风不下雨，纵然下点也是湿不遍地皮就散了”。霞渠村天增的爹（老头）说：“我可有了这个经验了，光绪廿六年，五月天了，还没下雨。大家都说：有钱难买五月旱，六月连阴吃饱饭”，我想六月下雨也不迟，可是六月初没有下，我想到六月半下了雨种早熟庄稼还可以，但又没下，到六月底还能种荞麦菜哩，一等二等进了七月，一连下了二十天，啥也没种上，那年饿死的人多哩，可把我教训够了！”领导上级以上说的都是四区）便抓住这些问题，号召各村干部在抗旱救荒中为民立功，并展开群众性的记功表功运动，这样转变了大家以上的消极思想，大家说：“要拿出去年土地改革和参军的热情来搞抗旱，还怕搞不好吗？”于是都从积极方面想法了，能修井的尽量扩大水地面积，不能的就先早收一部，担水点种一部，并大力组织纺织运输，往回换粮食蔬菜。领导上又提出以下口号：“一亩园能顶十亩田，互助打井不费难”，“回头想想灾荒年，妻离子散真可怜”，“旱耩地上草，苗子长的好”，“多采菜，多吃糠，每顿作饭节省”。“现在扔谷皮，将来饿肚皮”，“能吃半顿，不叫断顿”。“不害怕，不麻痹，做些准备就可以”。各村干部都纷纷订出了抗旱备荒计划，共计二十六村打井和修旧井七十眼，能阴地按苗四千零五十九亩。担水点种玉茭豆子九千一百亩（十个村），担水栽红薯三十亩，旱耩地二千一百二十三亩，妇女干部们除领导全体妇女每天平均纺织二两花布外，并每天每人节约二两米，打野菜多吃糠都要办到。另外就是多刨旱地，下了雨，二指能顶四指用，旱地先耙成沟，下了雨往沟里种垧大。
    这一运动有两点经验：一、打通思想要召开群众大会，抓住群众渴望按苗的积极思想，比如说早按一天苗，收量就又比迟一天大多哩，迅速轰起来就行。二、在行动中，劳英、干部、积极分子起了带头作用。群众一见有人下手就眼红了，特别是今年久旱不雨，下种捉苗思想迫切，所以只要有人一种，大家就跟着行动起来，很快便形成运动。
