Another detachment of our troops advanced towards Yanling and encountered the 191st Regiment of Liu Maoen's 64th Brigade in Jiucaiyuan, capturing more than 20 enemy soldiers, including a deputy battalion commander.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jiluyu Front, 22nd] General Liu Bocheng's headquarters issued Communiqué No. 3, announcing the results of the Juye-Jinxiang Victory: From the 12th to the 14th of this month, our army annihilated the entire invading Chiang Kai-shek's 32nd Division (Division Commander Tang Yongliang barely escaped with his life) and the entire 70th Division (except for one regiment and one brigade headquarters) between Juye and Jinxiang, totaling 19,000 people. Preliminary statistics of the battle results are as follows: A total of over 3,500 enemy soldiers, including Zhou Zuntang, brigade commander of the 139th Brigade of the 32nd Division, were killed; 15,260 enemy soldiers were captured alive, including Chen Yiding, lieutenant general and division commander of the 70th Division, Luo Zhedong, deputy division commander, Xu Hongcheng, staff officer (colonel) of the 141st Brigade of the 32nd Division, Zong Zhizhong, battalion commander (lieutenant colonel) of the engineer battalion, and Luo Shishen, regimental commander (colonel) of the 279th Regiment of the 140th Brigade of the 70th Division.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 22nd] The Jizhong People's Liberation Army has recovered the county towns of Xiongxian and Gaoyang. The victories of the People's Liberation Army in the Qingcang and Pingbao campaigns have posed a serious threat to the Chiang Kai-shek troops in the three key points of Pingjinbao. In an attempt to reverse their decline, the Chiang Kai-shek troops disregarded the emptiness of their rear and transferred approximately seven divisions (brigades) from the stubborn forces of Fu Zuoyi's 75th Army (101st Division and 4th Cavalry Division) in Chahar Province, the 4th Division of the 13th Army and the entire 16th Army (three divisions) in Rehe, and the 95th Brigade of the 62nd Division. Starting from the 7th, they invaded the hinterland of Jizhong. They captured Xiongxian on the 7th, Gaoyang on the 13th, Lixian on the 16th, and Suning on the 18th. The Jizhong military and civilians have launched fierce counterattacks against the enemy and advanced behind enemy lines, recovering Xiongxian on the 9th and Gaoyang on the 16th. Currently, except for the two cities of Lixian and Suning and their surrounding areas, which are occupied by the enemy, there are no enemy traces in the Gaoyang area.
