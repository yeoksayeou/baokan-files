Not a Good Man Until You Fight to the End
——A Record of JiYuan Militia Hero Niu Jincai
Gu Weijin
	In Shiloutou Village, JiYuan Fifth District, during the land reform, the masses of the whole village were suppressed by landlords and bullies, and only the militia hero Niu Jincai persisted in the struggle. His unyielding fighting spirit finally turned into an irresistible force, pushing the masses of the whole village to rise up, overthrow the landlords and bullies, and achieve a great transformation. The following is the course of the struggle as told by the hero Niu Jincai.
		I. Taking the Lead in Fighting the Landlords, Never Admitting Mistakes Even to Death
	Our village is called Stubborn Village, and the name is very fitting. You see, while other villages are carrying out land reform in full swing, our village is still silent. It's not surprising: the village government, the peasant association, the armed committee, etc., are all controlled by a group of landlords and bullies, so of course there will be no land reform. But when other villages started land reform, it had an impact on our village. The poor people were all clamoring for struggle, but when discussing the targets of struggle, they always couldn't avoid these people in power. Who could afford to provoke such people? Not only could they not be provoked, but no one dared to provoke the landlords they were shielding. Just as everyone was worrying, I proposed to fight Niu Yunshan. Everyone was very surprised, because Niu Yunshan was my cousin. Who would believe this? I explained to everyone: "Niu Yunshan used to be a teacher of the Red Bandits (Red Spear Society), and he used to be the chief of the puppet Public Security Bureau. He robbed the people's things. He should be fought! Don't look at him as my cousin, and I am a militiaman, I will never protect him!" Everyone was skeptical, so I said: "Dare to say, dare to do, I will take the lead, and everyone follow me!"
	This energy of mine stirred everyone up, and they followed me to fight Niu Yunshan. When Niu Yunshan saw so many people, he pretended to be very affectionate and said to me: "Brother, we are all family..." I interrupted him and said solemnly: "Revolutionary work, no protection!" He said: "What have I done wrong?" I said: "You have a body of white fur, and you don't even know you're a monster?" His eyes widened, and he suddenly walked into the room. I was quick-eyed and saw him taking a gun. His banditry had returned. I couldn't be polite to him. I jumped over and hugged him, and everyone rushed up together, tied him up, and confiscated the gun. Everyone then poured out their grievances... Later, Niu Yunshan was found to have one cow and 120,000 yuan.
		II. “Even If He Is a Tiger, We Must Knock Out One of His Teeth”
	After fighting Niu Yunshan, the masses said that I was selfless and capable, and elected me as the militia squad leader. At this time, the struggle had shaken the foundation of feudal rule in the village. One day, someone warned me: "Mind your own business, or you'll lose your head!" But I ignored this and continued to lead the masses in the struggle. The target was the landlord Niu Shanshu, who was a standing committee member of the peasant association. This time, I provoked the people in power, and they immediately tied me up and issued a warning to the whole village: "Anyone who learns from Niu Jincai will be punished lightly and shot dead severely!"
	This show of force was so powerful that the masses who had just raised their heads were all frightened and remained silent. Of course, no one dared to propose to protect me. In this atmosphere of terror, the people in power dragged me to the temple to be struggled against.
	"We've struggled against the wrong person, do you know that?" Fierce voices and fierce eyes surrounded me, as if they wanted to eat me. But I was not afraid - even if he was a tiger, I would knock out one of his teeth. I said loudly:
	"No mistake!"
	"Still stubborn? Still not admitting your mistake?"
	"What mistake have I made? Leading the poor to fight against landlords and bullies is not a mistake!" I said.
	The landlords were so angry that their faces turned red. They rolled up their sleeves and shouted:
	"Stubborn mind!"
	"Beat him!"
	"Eradicate him!"
	Immediately, many heavy slaps landed on my face and head. Then, I was tied tightly to a bench, and some people prepared big sticks, and some prepared stones. Obviously, they were going to beat me to death.
	But even if they beat me to death, I could not admit that struggling against landlords and bullies was a mistake. Think about it: my father died when I was twelve, and eight fen of land was swallowed up by the usury of the rich. Later, I worked as a hired hand for two and a half years, and as a long-term worker for two years, and as a blacksmith for two years, but because I was not strong enough, I was beaten by the shopkeeper so badly that I screamed wildly at night. In the famine year, my mother starved to death, and I became a bachelor. The head of the village forced me to join the puppet army; I refused, and he used a big pot to press on my head, beat me severely, and robbed me of the only two sheng of rice.... I have lived for twenty years, and not a day has passed without being oppressed and bullied by the rich. What is wrong with struggling against them? Hmph, I can't admit my mistake even if I die!
	The landlords prepared the things to beat people with and interrogated me again:
	"Listen, if you don't confess and admit your mistake, you'll be taken care of." This was the voice of Niu Shanshu, the landlord whom I led the masses to struggle against. When I heard it, I really wanted to bite him. I cursed:
	"Bully! Take care of me! It is glorious to be beaten to death for serving the people!"
	"Okay, this guy is stubborn to the end, should we take care of him?" Niu Shanshu waved his stick, soliciting the opinions of the masses. He hoped that the masses would say "yes" and he would beat me to death. But the masses have eyes, they know what kind of person Niu Jincai is, and they know what I am doing now, so many people did not speak, but just looked at me with panicked and sympathetic eyes.
	This silence had infinite power. The people in power felt a little isolated, and some people whispered complaints to each other: "Uh, it hasn't been fully brewed yet." So they announced a temporary adjournment and continued to brew the struggle.
		III. Fighting to the End Alone
	After the district office learned about this matter, due to the lack of in-depth work, they simply released me. Our village was still controlled by the landlord and bully group. Last winter, when the enemy occupied the town and was about to attack our village, the people in power attacked me again. First, they disintegrated my militia. The landlord Niu Shanshu said to the militia: "What will you do when the enemy comes?"
	"Fight him."
	"What if we are surrounded by the enemy?"
	The militiamen did not speak.
	Niu Shanshu said again: "Now there are enemies in Qinyang and Wangwu, and they are going to cooperate with the enemies in the town to surround us. You ten or so people, aren't you just waiting to die?" Originally, most of these militiamen had served in the puppet army, and they were shaken by these words. Sure enough, when the situation became urgent, some militiamen ran away, and some militiamen followed the people in power into the city to surrender to the enemy.
	The people in power disintegrated my militia and then brought ropes to tie me up at night, wanting to beat me to death. But, as luck would have it, when the situation was urgent, I suddenly found four guns in my house (these were left behind by some of the fleeing militiamen). I knew that there was a problem with the militia. In order to prevent the guns from falling into the hands of the landlords, I immediately sent them to the district. As a result, the people who were going to tie me up failed.
	At this time, the militia was left with only me, the squad leader.
	The situation was very tense. The enemy was only four or five li away from the village, and there was gunfire everywhere. The masses fled in droves. The people in power spread rumors that they would cut off my arms and skin me alive when they caught me... What should I do in this atmosphere of terror?
	It was dark. I carried my gun and walked out quietly. Before me was a dark night. How could one person and one gun operate? But what could I do if I didn't operate?... There was no other way, I had to do it! I made up my mind and ran to the district headquarters.
		IV. Defeating the Counterattack and Armed Escort for the Great Turnaround
	At the district headquarters, I joined the militia rotation team and became a squad leader, leading ten or so militiamen. Thinking back to these days, the people in power harmed me so badly that I almost lost my life. Now that I have people and guns, how should I take revenge? - If I don't turn the poor people in the village around, I, Niu Jincai, will really not be a good man!
	I led the militia back to the village to fight guerrilla warfare. One day, the people in power called Niu Shanyou back to the village to retrieve the struggle account books, intending to carry out a large-scale counterattack. I sneaked into Niu Shanyou's house overnight. He was carrying the account books and was about to go out. I said: "Don't move!" He ran away, and I shot him. He was so frightened that he didn't dare to move, and I tied him up and took back the account books.
	The masses were happy when they heard about this. They said: "Jincai has saved everyone." Later, every time I returned to the village to operate, the nearby masses would return to the village to watch their homes. I took the opportunity to publicize current events and stabilize people's hearts. The masses slowly united around me.
	So I encouraged the masses to rise up and struggle again. I said: "It is a dream for the old rich to suppress the poor from rising up to struggle. I, Niu Jincai, am an example... Whoever dares to do it, follow me, this time we will fight to the end!" Because of the backbone promotion of the militia I brought back, a self-defense force was quickly organized to stand guard and patrol, and joint defense was carried out with other villages. As a result, the masses' enthusiasm for struggle immediately rose. Even the old women and old men said: "With guns guarding the door, we are not afraid. If they come, we will fight, if they don't come, we will divide the loot!" So seventy or eighty households locked their doors every day and went to the landlord's house to move things. They moved and divided them, and everyone had a share. The masses said happily: "Just do it like this, see who he comes back to look for." The masses divided the things, and the armed forces were strengthened. In addition, the masses said that I always insisted on the struggle, and elected me as the director of the armed committee. On April 1st, the county held a militia hero meeting, and I was elected as the county's first-class militia hero.

    不斗到底，不算好汉
    ——记济源民兵英雄牛进财
    古维进
    济源五区石露头村，在土地改革中，全村群众被地主恶霸打击下去，只有民兵英雄牛进财一个人坚持斗争。他这种不屈不挠的斗争精神，终于变成不可抗拒的力量，推动全村群众，起来颠覆地主恶霸，实行大翻身。下面是英雄牛进财所说的斗争的经过。
            一、领头斗地主，死也不认错
    我村有人叫顽固村，叫得很不错，你想：别村在热闹的进行土地改革，我村还是无声无息。说来也不奇怪：村公所、农会、武委会等，都被一群地主恶霸把持着，当然不会有土地改革。但是别村搞起土地改革，对俺村有影响，穷人都嚷着要斗争，但是讨论起斗争对象，总是离不开这些当权派，谁惹得起这般人呢？不仅惹不起他们，连他们包庇的地主也没人敢惹。大家正在发愁，我就提出斗牛云山。大家很惊讶，因为牛云山是我的堂兄，谁相信这个话呢？我向大家解释说：“牛云山当过红匪（红枪会）的老师，当过伪公安局长，抢过群众的东西，该斗！不要看他是我的堂哥，我又是一个民兵，我决不包庇他！”大家半信半疑，我又说：“敢说敢干，我领头，大家跟上来吧！”
    我这股劲头，把大家鼓动起来，便跟我去斗牛云山。牛云山看见人多，装得很亲热的给我说：“老弟，咱们都是一家……。”我截断他的话严正地说：“革命工作，不能包庇！”他说：“我有啥过吧？”我说：“你身上长的一身白毛，还不知道自己是妖精？”他眼睛一瞪，忽然往房里走去，我眼快，看见他在拿枪，他的土匪劲又来了。不能给他客气，我蹦过去把他抱住，众人一齐拥上，把他捆起，把枪缴了。大家就诉苦………后来斗出牛云山一头牛和十二万元。
            二、“是虎也要搬他一个牙”
    斗了牛云山，群众都说我大公无私，能办事，举我当民兵分队长。这时，斗争已震动村中封建统治的基础，一天，有人给我警告说：“少管闲事，当心二斤半（脑袋）吧！”但是，我没有理这一回事，又领导群众斗争，对象是地主牛善书，他是农会常委。这一下可惹上当权派了，他们马上把我捆起来，并向全村发出警告说：“谁要学牛进财的样，轻则处罚，重则枪毙！”
    这个下马威好利害，才抬头的群众都给吓得悄悄地，没人敢啃声。当然，也就没人敢提出保我了。就在这种恐怖场合里，当权派把我闹到大庙去斗争。
    “斗错人了，知道不知道？”凶恶的声音，凶恶的眼睛把我包围，好象要把我吃掉，但我并不害怕——就是他是一只虎，我也要搬他一只牙，我大声说：
    “没有斗错！”
    “还硬嘴？还不承认错误？”
    “我有什么错误？领导穷人斗争地主恶霸，没有错！”我说。
    地主们气得面红耳赤，卷起袖子吆喝道：
    “顽固脑筋！”
    “打！”
    “铲除他！”
    立刻，许多沉重的巴掌落在我的面颊、头上，随即又把我紧紧捆在板凳上，同时有人准备大棍，有人准备石头，显然，他们要把我往死里打了。
    但是，就是把我打死，我也不能承认斗争地主恶霸是错误。想一想：我十二岁死了父亲，八分地就给老财的高利贷吞掉。以后给人放了两年半，干了两年长工，又干了两年铁匠，都因为气力不足，被掌柜打的夜里狂叫。灾荒年，母亲饿死，我成了一个单身汉，保长又迫我去干皇协军；我不干，用大锅压在头顶，毒打一顿，又把仅有的二升米抢走……。我活了二十年，那一天不受老财压迫欺侮，斗争他们还有什么错呢？哼，打死我也不能认错！
    地主准备好打人的东西，又审问起来：
    “听着，要不坦白认错，就要收拾了。”这是我领导群众斗争的对象、地主牛善书的声音，我一听见，简直要咬他一口，我骂道：
    “恶霸！收拾吧！为人民服务，打死也光荣！”
    “好，这家伙顽固到底，该不该收拾？”牛善书挥起棍子，征求群众的意见。他希望群众说一声“该”，就要把我打死。但是，群众是有眼睛的，他们知道我牛进财是什么人，知道我现在是为了什么，于是许多人没有出声，只是睁着慌张而又同情的目光看我。
    这一下的沉默，具有无限的力量，当权派感到有点孤立了，有的人交头接耳的说着埋怨话：“呃，就没有酝酿成熟呀。”于是宣布暂时休会，继续酝酿斗争。
            三、单人独马干到底
    区署知道这件事情后，由于工作不深入，只把我释放了事。俺村照旧还是地主恶霸集团所把持。当去年冬天敌人占领城关，将要向俺村一带进攻时，当权派又来向我进攻。首先瓦解我的民兵，地主牛善书对民兵说：“敌人来了怎么办？”
    “跟他干。”
    “如果给敌人包围呢？”
    民兵没有说话。
    牛善书又说：“现在沁阳、王屋都有敌人，就要配合城关敌人包围过来，你们十来个人，不是等死？”本来这些民兵大部干过皇协军的，听了这话发生动摇，果然，当情况紧急时，有的民兵逃跑，有的民兵跟当权派进城投敌。
    当权派瓦解了我的民兵，又连夜带上绳子要来捆我，想把我打死。但是，事有凑巧，当情况紧急时，忽然发现家中有四支枪（这是一部分逃跑的民兵丢下的），我知道民兵出了问题，为使枪支不致落在地主手中，我即刻把它送到区上，于是，捆我的人便落了空。
    这个时候，民兵就只剩下我分队长一个人了。
    情况很紧张，敌人距村子只有四五里，四处有枪声，群众纷纷逃跑，当权派放出空气说：抓住我要先斩胳膊后剥皮………在这种恐怖情况下，我怎么办呢？
    天黑，我扛着枪悄悄走出去，眼前是一片黑糊糊的夜，一个人一杆枪怎样活动呢？但是不活动又怎么办呢？………没有第二条路，只有干，！我拿定主意，便跑到了区指挥部。
            四、打垮倒算，武装掩护大翻身
    在区指挥部，我参加民兵轮战队，当小队长，领导十来个民兵。想起这些日子，当权派把我害得单人独马，几乎丧命，现在有人有枪，我应该怎样报仇呵。——不把村上穷人翻起身，我牛进财真不算好汉！
    我领着民兵回村打游击。一天，当权派叫牛善有回村取斗争账本，打算大规模倒算。我连夜摸到牛善有的家。他夹着账本正想出去，我说：“不准动！”他拔腿便跑，我给他一枪，他吓得不敢动，便把他捆起夺回账本。
    群众听到这件事情，高兴的说：“进财可救了大家。”以后，我每次回村活动，附近群众听见，都要回村看家，我趁机宣传时事，安定人心，群众慢慢团结在我的周围。
    于是我又鼓动群众起来斗争，我说：“老财要想压制穷人起来斗争，都是梦想，我牛进财就是一个样……谁敢干，跟上来吧，这一次要斗到底！”由于有我带回的民兵作骨干推动，很快组织起自卫队站岗放哨，又和别村进行联防，于是群众斗争情绪立刻就高涨起来，甚至老婆老汉都说：“有枪杆看住门，不怕，他来就打，不来就分！”于是七八十户人家，每天锁了门到地主家里搬东西，随搬随分，人人有份，群众都痛快的说：“就这样办，看他回来找那一个吧。”群众分了东西，武装随即壮大起来，另外，群众说我始终坚持斗争，选我当武委会主任，四月一日，县上开民兵英雄大会，又选我为全县一等民兵英雄。
