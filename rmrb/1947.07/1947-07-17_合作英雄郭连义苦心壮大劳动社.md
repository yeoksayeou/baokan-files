    Cooperative Hero Guo Lianyi Spends Great Effort to Expand the Labor Cooperative
    [Our Newspaper, Zuoquan News] Donghuangzhang in the Fifth District is a very scattered mountain village. Nineteen small settlements form an administrative village with a total of 450 people and nine qing of land, averaging two mu per person. Half of the land is hillside, and even in good years, the harvest is not enough to feed people for a year due to the thick rocks and thin soil. At that time, in the village, many people had to share a quilt among four or five people, and some families had no quilts at all, using sheepskins which let in wind from all sides as if they had no cover.
    In this situation, Guo Lianyi discussed with the masses the establishment of a labor cooperative to solve the difficulties of eating and clothing. At that time, the masses said, "Establishing a labor cooperative would be good, but there is no share capital." Lianyi repeatedly explained to everyone, "Don't worry, we have plenty of mountain products and grain. As long as everyone is determined to engage in transportation and textiles, with labor and grain, we can turn them into share capital." At that time, everyone elected Guo Lianyi as the director of the cooperative, which was officially established in December 1945. The main business directions were transportation and textiles. The original share capital was 48,000 yuan, and some people used grain to offset their shares. At that time, Lianyi also discussed with everyone to organize a transportation team to carry grain and hemp to Wu'an Yangyi for sale. After five or six trips, they transported 35 shi of grain and earned 290,000 yuan in cash. At this moment, the masses happily said, "Now we have money to invest!" The share capital immediately expanded to more than 100,000 yuan. Since its establishment, it has been two years, and dividends have been distributed three times. Now the share capital has expanded to more than 600,000 yuan. In December 1946, the whole county selected cooperative models, and Lianyi was selected as a county cooperative hero. After he returned from attending the county hero meeting, he discussed with the members to further implement the plan of cultivating one field to have excess for one. They wanted to expand various workshops and develop textiles to achieve self-sufficiency in cloth. In February of this year, four branch villages established four textile workshops. In addition, the labor cooperative also has a textile training class to train weaving personnel in each branch village. The village originally had 70 spinning wheels, which have now increased to 120. There were originally seven looms, which have now increased to twenty-one, including one 24-thread machine. By early May, 1,500 jin of cloth had been woven, and the annual plan to exceed 3,000 jin of cloth can be achieved. Calculating six jin of cloth per person, the village will have a surplus of 300 jin of cloth throughout the year. At a price of 1,600 yuan per jin, it can be sold for 480,000 yuan, enough for the whole village to buy oil and salt. The five workshops can earn a total dividend of 6,650,000 yuan throughout the year. During the re-election of the director in April of this year, the members unanimously proposed that the cooperative hero Guo Lianyi should continue to serve as the director. The reason everyone gave was that Lianyi can endure hardship, is determined to serve the masses, and can expand the original share capital of 48,000 yuan to more than 600,000 yuan. He has also developed five major workshops and built five textile workshops, enabling us to be self-sufficient in cloth and bringing great benefits to the masses.

    合作英雄郭连义苦心壮大劳动社
    【本报左权讯】五区东黄漳是很零乱的一个山庄，十九片小窝集合成一个行政村，共四百五十口人有九顷地，每人平均二亩，有半数地是坡地，因石厚土薄纵然是好年景粮食也不够一年食用，当时村上四、五个人合盖一条被子的人很多，还有几家没被子，盖的是羊皮，四面透风和不盖被一样。
    在这个情况下，郭连义和群众们讨论要成立一个劳动社，解决大家吃饭、穿衣困难，当时群众说：“成立劳动社倒也好，就是没有股金”，连义和大家再三解释：“大家不要发愁，咱有的是山货粮食，只要大家决心搞运输，搞纺织，有劳力有粮食也能变成股金。”当时大家选郭连义当了社长，于一九四五年十二月正式成立起来，业务方向主要是运输、纺织，原先股金四万八千元，有的人拿粮顶了股金。当时连义又和大家商讨组织运输队，担粮和麻到武安阳邑出卖，来往搞了五、六次，运输了粮三十五石，脚力洋二十九万元，这一下群众高兴的说：“这可有钱入股了”，股本一下扩大到十万余元。自成立到现在有二年时间，共分了三次红利，现在股本又扩大到六十余万元。在一九四六年十二月，全县选拔合作模范，连义被选为县合作英雄，他参加县英会回来后，和社员们商讨，进一步的做到耕一余一计划，要扩大各个作坊，开展纺织，做到穿布自给；在今年二月间，四个副村建立四个纺织工房，另外劳动社还有一个纺织训练班，培养各副村织布人员，计全村原有纺车七十架，现增加至一百二十架，原有织布机七架，现增至二十一架，内有抽二十四线机一架，五月初已织布一千五百斤，全年能超过三千斤布计划，每人以六斤布计，全村全年除穿布能余布三百斤，每斤布以一千六百元计，共卖洋四十八万元，够全村吃油、吃盐花用。连五个作坊，全年可共得红利洋六百六十五万元。在今年四月间复选社长时，社员们一致提出还让合作英雄郭连义任社长，大家提的理由是连义能吃苦，决心为群众服务，能把原先四万八千的股金扩大到六十余万元，又开展了五大作坊，又建设了五个纺织工房，使咱们能穿布自给，给群众谋了很大利益。
