Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 16th: In Yindu District, Er Township, Mizhi County, a Young Pioneers team has emerged, actively participating in war support and wartime propaganda. It is composed of seventy-two rural children. They volunteer to stand guard, and in just ten days, they discovered seven pedestrians without travel permits, all of whom were handed over to the government for processing. On May 20th, when a group of wounded soldiers was transported to Yangjiagou, the village team members collected a large number of eggs and noodles within two days and sent four representatives to express their condolences, deeply moving all the wounded. Each team member is young and has strong legs, and the speed of delivering letters exceeds that of adults, earning them the nickname "Wind Gourd" (meaning as fast as the wind). In addition to war support, they have become little teachers for the masses, using their mouths, as diligent as their legs, to spread the glorious victories of the People's Liberation Army on all fronts to every corner of the countryside.

    米脂少先队战勤作得好
    【新华社西北十六日电】米脂县印斗区二乡涌现一支积极参加战勤和战时宣传的少年先锋队，它由七十二名农村儿童所组成。他们自动，任放哨，仅在十天内，即查获七个未带路条的行人，均被送交政府处理。五月二十日，有一批伤员运到杨家沟，村队员们即于两天内募集大批鸡蛋挂面，派四个代表携往慰问，使全体伤员极为感动。队员个个年轻腿劲，转送信件的速度超过成年人，博得了“风葫芦”（即风一样快之意）的称号。战勤之余，他们就成了群众的小先生，以他们的和腿一样勤快的嘴，将各线人民解放军的辉煌胜利传播到农村的每个角落。
