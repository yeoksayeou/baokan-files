    Fengfeng Mining Area Workers' Cooperative Dividend Announcement
    The fifth term (January to June) dividend of our cooperative has been calculated. It is decided that the period from the 16th of this month to August 5th will be the dividend distribution, share withdrawal, and share subscription period. We hope that all shareholders will bring their shares to collect the dividends. If someone is entrusted to handle it on their behalf, they must have a formal share certificate and a letter of introduction from the shareholder. If the dividends are not collected after the deadline, our cooperative will deposit the dividends into the next term's share capital.
