　　Topdressing Autumn Crops Results in Good Harvests Regardless of Drought or Flood
  　An'yang Village Masses Actively Apply Fertilizer
    [This dispatch from our reporter in Pingshun] On June 1st of the lunar calendar, the An'yang Village of the Seventh District convened a mass meeting of the entire village to mobilize topdressing. Cui Fubao, a labor hero in the village, actively responded, saying: "People live by eating, and crops thrive on fertilizer. This spring was dry, and the early summer brought hailstorms, which has already reduced the harvest. But if we want to increase the yield, we must apply topdressing. As the saying goes, 'The yellow weasel eats the sick chicken.' It's just like crops that lack fertilizer can't withstand drought. The more fertilizer, the better they can withstand drought, flood, and hailstorms." He himself made a plan for topdressing, with more than thirty loads of night soil and two dou of mustard cake for six mu of cornfields, averaging seven loads of fertilizer per mu, to be completed within thirteen days. Subsequently, each group began discussions. Some said that topdressing was good for the crops, but they couldn't afford it. Niu Zenghe calculated and said: On average, applying seven loads of fertilizer per mu would cost the equivalent of seven sheng of grain, but the crops would yield an additional two dou, so topdressing was more beneficial. After clarifying their thinking in this way, they formulated a village-wide plan. For the 963 mu of autumn crops, they planned to topdress half of the land, with each mu receiving seven loads, totaling 481.5 mu, requiring 3,370 loads of fertilizer, to be completed within fifteen days. The next day (May 3rd), Cui Fubao led his group to set a model, and under his promotion and influence, a village-wide upsurge in topdressing was created. Li Jieren, who used to be a lazy person, now found places where sheep rested to scrape manure and urine, and topdressed all six mu of his land. He said: "This year, our crops must grow well, or we'll lose face." Li Faqun, who was sixty years old, carried a jar (of night soil) to the fields every day for topdressing. He saved every load of fertilizer in the pit and delivered it to the fields. The whole village praised his crops for growing tall and thick. As Miao Youxin said: "Faqun's crops were also affected by drought and hailstorms, but they grew better than anyone else's." Old man Faqun couldn't stop smiling and said: "Since spring, I have applied more than 600 loads of fertilizer to my three mu of land, more than anyone else. The crops are also growing better than anyone else's." Sixty-year-old woman Shi Zhao carried jars to topdress two mu. According to statistics from the eleventh team: 2,400 loads of topdressing have already been applied, along with one trough of sesame cake (each trough using eight dou of sesame seeds) and one dou of mustard cake, covering more than 450 mu of land, and topdressing is still continuing.

　　秋苗上追粪旱涝均多收
  　安阳村群众积极追肥
    【本报平顺讯】七区安阳村于阴历六月一日召开全村群众大会，动员上追粪。该村劳英崔富保积极响应，他说：“人活靠吃饭，庄稼肥靠粪大。今春天旱，交夏就下了冷蛋，庄稼已减了收成，可是要想多收，就非上追粪不行。俗话说：“黄狼吃的是病鸡”，恰象庄稼粪少不耐旱一样，越粪大，旱、涝下冷蛋都有担代”。他自己并作出上追粪计划，现有圊粪三十余担，芥茉二斗，玉茭地六亩，平均每亩地上追粪七担，于十三天内完成。至此各组即展开讨论。有的说上追粪对庄稼倒好就是上不起，牛增和即算帐说：每亩平均上肥七担，就得七升粮食的代价，可是庄稼要多收二斗还是上追粪利大。这样拉通思想后，订出全村计划。计秋苗九百六十三亩，按一半上追，每亩上够七担，共计四百八十一亩五分需粪三千三百七十担，于十五日内完成。次日（五月三日）崔富保就带领该组首起模范，在他的推动影响下，就造成全村上追粪的热潮。李杰仁过去是个懒汉，这次也找到羊群歇晌的粪尿泊去刮粪，六亩多地全上了追粪。他说：“今年咱的庄稼怎也得长好，不然就给咱丢了人。”李法群六十岁了，每天上地要担上罐（圊肥）。粪坑存下一担送一担。全村都赞扬他地的庄稼长的好高又粗。如苗有信说：“法群的庄稼也旱，冷蛋也打，可是比别人长的都好。”法群老汉止不住笑咪咪的说：“自春到现在，我三亩地已上了六百多担粪，比谁上的粪都多。庄稼也长得比准都强。”六十多岁的老太婆师赵氏抬罐上追粪二亩。现据十一组统计：已上追粪两千四百担，麻饼一槽（每槽用八斗麻子），芥茉一斗，地四百五十余亩，现仍在继续上追粪中。
