Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 20th. After a year of effort, the People's Post Office in the Jin-Sui Liberated Area has reached all villages within the territory and established postal connections with various liberated areas. The postal routes extend for 50,276 *li*, with 45 post offices, 8 postal stations, and 1 office. Of the millions of pieces of mail handled daily, more than two-thirds are letters between the people of this area and their relatives and soldiers. A large number of people's newspapers are continuously flowing into every village and company. People in the vicinity of Taiyuan and Datong can also receive the newspapers and books from the liberated areas on schedule. Postal workers on major routes work day and night shifts, braving wind, frost, rain, snow, desolate mountains, and fierce beasts, rushing to deliver mail. For example, from Xingxian to Zhongyang, a 380 *li* walk to Datong is sufficient to arrive. The masses echo their convenience. In the past, the postal service set up by the Chiang regime in this area only reached the cities, purely serving landlords and merchants. It gradually collapsed during the War of Resistance against Japan, with fewer than four post offices remaining.

　　日夜兼程赶送晋绥邮路畅通
    【新华社晋绥廿日电】晋绥解放区人民解放区邮政，经一年努力，已通达全境乡村，并与各解放区通邮。邮线长达五万零二百七十六里、设立邮局四十五处，邮站八所及办事处一所，每日千万件邮件中，三分之二以上为本区人民与其亲友及子弟兵之间的书信。大量人民报纸源源流入每一乡村与连队，太原及大同近郊等区人民亦均可按期接读解放区书报。邮政员，工在主要干线上均为日夜班，不避风霜雨雪，荒山猛兽，兼程赶送，如兴县至中阳三百八十里步行到大同即可到达，群众回声称便，按昔日蒋政本区所设邮政仅及于城，纯为地主商人服务，抗战中即相继瓦解，邮局残存者不及四处。
