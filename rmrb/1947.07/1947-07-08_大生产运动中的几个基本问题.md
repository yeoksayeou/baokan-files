Several Basic Questions in the Great Production Movement
    Li Fietang, Shi Fu

This year's Great Production Movement, due to the realization of "land to the tiller," and farmers working and producing on their own land, has experienced new developments and new distinct characteristics in various aspects. Our leadership must clearly recognize and grasp these characteristics under this new situation in order to greatly advance this year's production movement. In the past six months, Yu She has explored some experiences in this area, and they are presented here for study:

    I. Rely on poor peasants and hired laborers to unite with middle peasants, and lead mass production with a class perspective.

After the land reform movement, farmers have land, class lines are clarified, and farmers' awareness is heightened. Therefore, in production, we should use the newly emancipated poor peasants and hired laborers as the backbone, while uniting with middle peasants and cultivating new heroes from poor peasant and hired laborer backgrounds to lead the Great Production Movement. Because after the land reform movement, poor peasants and hired laborers were all emancipated and gained land, their production consciousness greatly increased, and they inevitably demanded to actively engage in production and labor to become prosperous. However, the middle peasant class, due to their level of awareness and production enthusiasm not keeping up with the newly emancipated poor peasants and hired laborers after the movement, and even having concerns, cannot unite the farmers for production on the basis of class consciousness. According to the experience of the Yu She production movement in the past six months, it proves that the place that recognized and grasped this characteristic, relied on the poor peasants and hired laborers, united with the middle peasants, clarified class lines, and cultivated new poor peasant and hired laborer backbone heroes to take the lead in production, that place was very enthusiastic, and the production movement could be launched. Conversely, the place that did not rely on the poor peasants and hired laborers, and did not have new poor peasant and hired laborer backbones to take the lead, that place could not launch the production movement. For example, this year's production movement in Da Yan in the Fourth District, due to the growth of the emancipated poor peasant hero Wang Jinshu leading the entire village in production, organizing mutual aid groups with emancipated farmers as the main body in combination with middle peasants, clarifying class lines, relying on the peasant association to carry out activities, and discussing and resolving production issues, demonstrated the village's unity, active and pragmatic work, and a democratic and energetic leadership style. Conversely, Xi Shan used to be an advanced production village in Yu She, but because this year's production leadership backbone were middle and rich peasants, coupled with the incomplete nature of the movement, this year's production not only could not maintain its original state, but instead declined.

    II. After land reform, the wage issue in production mutual aid.

After the land reform movement, class relations have undergone great changes, and the basic labor methods of farmers have changed. In the past, they worked for landlords and rich peasants, but today they have changed to producing on their own land. Therefore, after farmers have been emancipated and have land, production mutual aid wages must be reduced in order to benefit farmers and develop production. Because before the land reform, land was in the hands of landlords and rich peasants, and most farmers worked for landlords and rich peasants, selling their labor to earn wages to maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, at that time, in order to benefit farmers, it was necessary to emphasize raising wages. However, after the land reform movement, land was returned to the farmers, and most farmers were working and producing on their own land, with very few selling their labor. Those with surplus labor were only landlords and rich peasants. If they still emphasized raising wages, it would unintentionally be equivalent to rewarding the landlords and restricting the newly emancipated farmers who had land but lacked labor, and even affecting their continued prosperity due to the payment of wages. As for the production mutual aid among farmers, it is of a rotational nature, and even if the wages are lower, it is also beneficial to the farmers themselves. Currently, the wages in Yu She's production mutual aid have been raised to nine liters of millet per day, resulting in farmers being unable to afford to pay due to the excessively high wages, and even specifically calculating that the annual harvest is not enough to cover the annual wages, with a large disconnect. Therefore, some farmers, in order to reduce wage expenses, are rushing to finish their own field work early in the mutual aid group to avoid hiring people and paying less wages. On the surface, this year's production is progressing quickly and doing well, but in reality, it is being done hastily for fear of paying wages. Based on the above situation, after the land reform movement, production mutual aid wages must be reduced in order to facilitate the development of production, benefit farmers, and consolidate mutual aid. Currently, one of the reasons why some farmers are unwilling to help each other and want to do their own work is the excessive wages.

    III. Further clarify the development direction of new rich peasants.

After last year's land reform movement in Yu She, some old middle peasants and new rich peasants had the fear of being "cut down like韭菜 (chives)" and the fear of struggle. After the general training of farmers, this idea was basically resolved. However, according to the current understanding of new rich peasants, due to the lack of clarity regarding the development direction, although the fear of being "cut down like韭菜 (chives)" has been resolved, and they know that there will never be a reckoning, they are not very actively demanding to continue to become wealthy and expand production. Generally, they are satisfied with managing their existing property well. For example, some new rich peasants, especially new rich peasants developed from old middle peasants, say: "If new rich peasants continue to develop, won't they become new landlords?" Others say: "Now that farmers have land to cultivate, who will we hire to work? And who will we buy land from?" They believe that they have reached their peak and can no longer develop, not understanding that the wealth of general new rich peasants is still far behind, nor understanding that they can continue to develop from industry and commerce, and are only circling on the land. Therefore, some new rich peasants still maintain their original state and dare not develop boldly. Therefore, how to educate farmers to understand the development direction of new rich peasants and develop wealth on a large scale is an extremely important issue at present.

    IV. Must mobilize the masses for production from a positive perspective based on class consciousness.

This year's production movement in Yu She was carried out under extremely difficult conditions with a large number of participating labor forces. However, the spring plowing, sowing, and weeding movements were completed ahead of schedule, especially the combination of participation in war and production achieved unprecedented results. This spring, a large number of labor forces participated in the war, and the labor forces remaining in the rear not only completed their own spring plowing and sowing, but also consciously and early prepared the production for the participants in the war, laying a favorable foundation for future participation in the war. For example, Zhang Si, a militiaman participating in the war from Dazhai in the Second District, said: "We can't do it as well at home as we do here." Another example is Zhang Wanxiang, a seventy-one-year-old emancipated man, who said: "We are working as tenant farmers for the participants in the war in the rear, which is equivalent to participating in the war in the front." This great achievement is due to the increased awareness of farmers after the emancipation movement, and on the other hand, also due to the fact that since the beginning of spring this year, all work in Yu She has been carried out from a positive perspective, launching a series of ideological and conscious movements, and mobilizing and progressing from a positive perspective. At the beginning of spring plowing, the leadership consciously raised the issue of labor difficulties, loudly proposed constant preparation for participation in the war, called on the masses to prepare ideologically as early as possible, and actively sought ways to overcome difficulties. Especially after the mass emancipation movement, farmers universally conducted armed consciousness, enlightened the masses' ideas of joining the army and participating in the war, young people actively joined the army, and middle-aged and elderly people actively participated in the war. Production and tenant farming were all ideologically prepared and highly aware. In addition, when the war arrived, the masses were generally organized to discuss and make mutual guarantees between the front and rear. Everything was resolved from a positive perspective, and everything started from giving play to the creativity of the masses. Therefore, although labor was very difficult this year and a large number of labor forces participated in the war, the production movement was not affected in any way.

　　大生产运动中的几个基本问题
    李芾棠　石夫
    今年的大生产运动，由于实现了耕者有其田，农民在自己的土地上劳动生产，因此在各方面都有了新的发展和新的不同的特点。我们领导上必须在这个新的情况下明确认识和掌握这一特点，才能使今年生产运动大大开展。榆社半年来在这方面曾摸索到一些经验，特提出供研究：
    一、依靠贫雇团结中农，以阶级观点领导群众生产。
    经过土地改革运动，农民有了土地，阶级界线划清，农民觉悟提高，因此生产中应以新翻身贫雇为骨干，同时团结中农培养新的贫雇出身的英雄领导开展大生产运动。因为经过了土地改革运动后，贫雇都翻了身，获得土地，生产自觉大大提高，必然要求积极生产劳动发家，而中农阶层则因运动以后觉悟程度生产情绪都赶不上新翻身的贫雇，甚至还有顾虑，不能在阶级觉悟的基础上团结农民生产。根据榆社半年来生产运动的经验，证明了那个地方认识与掌握了这一特点，依靠了贫雇团结了中农，划清了阶级界线，培养新的贫雇骨干英雄，带头领导生产，那个地方就很起劲，生产运动就能开展；反之那个地方不依靠贫雇，没有新的贫雇骨干带头，那个地方生产运动就开展不起来。如四区大堰的今年生产运动，由于生长了翻身贫雇英雄王金书领导全村生产，以翻身农民为主结合了中农组织了互助组，划清了阶级界线，依靠农会进行活动，讨论解决生产问题，因此表现了该村的团结一致积极实干，领导上的作风民主，劲头很大。反之如西山过去是榆社生产先进村，但由于今年生产领导骨干是中、富农，再加运动没有彻底，因此今年的生产不但不能保持原状，相反的降低了。
    二、土地改革后，生产互助的工资问题。
    经过土地改革运动后，阶级关系有了很大变化，农民劳动方式基本改变。过去给地主富农劳动，今天已变为在自己土地上进行生产，因此经过农民翻身有了土地后，生产互助工资必须降低，才能有利于农民，有利于发展生产。因为在未经土地改革以前，土地在地主富农手里，农民大部是给地主富农劳动出卖劳力获得工资维持生活，所以那时候为了有利于农民，应该强调提高工资。但经过土地改革运动后，土地归还农民，农民大部分都在自己的土地上劳动生产，很少的出卖劳力，有剩余劳力的，只有地主富农了，这样如果仍强调提高工资，无意中等于奖励了地主，限制了有土地而劳力少的新翻身农民，甚至因出工资影响其继续发家。至于农民之间的生产互助，他是轮流性质，即便工资低些，对农民本身也是有利的。目前榆社生产互助中的工资已提高到每日九升小米，结果农民由于工资过高无力支出，甚至具体计算一年收获不足一年工资，脱节很大，所以有些农民为了少出工资，在互助组中都争先把自己地里活提前做完，以免用人互助少出工资。从表面上看，今年生产赶的快做的好，但实际上因怕出工资很粗糙的做过了。根据以上情况，在土地改革运动后，生产互助工资必须降低才有利于发展生产，有利于农民，才会巩固互助。目前有些农民不愿互助，想各做各的，工资过高也是原因之一。
    三、更加明确新富农的发展方向。
    榆社经过去年土地改革运动后，一部分老中农新富农曾产生过怕割韭菜怕斗争思想，经过了农民普训，这个思想基本上解决了。但新富农根据目前了解，由于对于发展方向的不明确，虽然怕割韭菜思想得到了解决，知道了永远不会清算，但如何继续发家致富，扩大生产，就不很积极要求了。一般的是满足于经营好现有的财产，如有些新富农特别是老中农发展起来的新富农说：新富农再发展不是成了新地主吗？还有的说：农民都有了地种，咱们再雇谁劳动？而且再向谁买地啦？他们认为自己已经达到顶点，再不能发展了，不了解现在一般新富农的财富还差的很远，也不了解再从工商业方面继续发展，只是在土地上打圈子，所以目前有些新富农仍然是保持原状不敢大胆发展的态度。因此今后如何教育农民了解新富农发展方向，大量的发展财富，是当前极重要的问题。
    四、必须在阶级自觉的基础上从积极方面发动群众生产。
    榆社今年生产运动是在大批参战劳力极端困难的条件下进行的，但春耕下种锄苗运动都提前完成，特别是参战生产的结合成绩空前，今春大批劳力参战，留在后方的劳力不但完成了自己的春耕下种，而且很自觉的及早做好了参战人员的生产，给今后参战打下了有利基础。如二区大寨参战民兵张四小说：咱在家也不能象这样做的合适。又如七十一岁的翻身老汉张万祥说：咱在后方给参战人员代耕，等于到前方参战。这一伟大成绩是由于农民经过了翻身运动觉悟提高，另一方面也由于今年榆社自入春以来一切工作都是从正面提出号召进行了一系列的思想自觉运动，从积极方面进行发动与进展的结果。春耕开始领导上就有意识的提出了劳力困难，响亮的提出了经常准备参战，号召群众及早思想准备，并主动寻找克服困难的办法，特别是在群众翻身运动后，农民又普遍的进行了武装自觉，启发了群众参军、参战思想，青年人积极参军，中、老年积极参战，生产代耕都有了思想准备和高度的觉悟，再加以参战到来，普遍组织群众讨论，前后方互做保证。一切从积极方面解决问题，一切从发挥群众创造性出发，因此今年虽然劳力十分困难又有大批劳力参战，而生产运动并未受到任何影响。
