　　Wangjiayuan Mutual Aid Team Makes Precise Calculations
　　Intensifies Weeding, Draws Labor, and Sells Workdays
　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 21st dispatch] The Qinyuan Wangjiayuan Mutual Aid Team made precise calculations while weeding for the second time, drawing out surplus labor to sell workdays. After summarizing the first weeding, they reassigned tasks according to each person's skills. The first and second squads, consisting of forty-three people, drew out twelve people to engage in other production. They proposed, "Go to the fields early, return home late, don't rest at noon, quickly finish weeding our own, so we can work for others." They also stipulated that the weeding wage would be five sheng of rice, which greatly motivated everyone. Starting from June 21st, Du Wu'er's group of four people weeded 13.5 mu of corn in one day. The first and second squads, with twenty-three people, used 261 workdays in seven days, thus completing the weeding of all 503 mu of corn, hemp, beans, and yams, averaging 3.1 mu per workday. Then, in four days, they weeded another 212.8 mu of seedlings, averaging nearly 3 mu per workday. If it were individual labor, each workday could only weed 2 mu. Thus, work efficiency was increased by one-third. Therefore, during the seven days of weeding, they were able to draw out twenty-three young people to sell 345 workdays in Chengguan, earning 55,000 yuan. Currently, the team is concentrating its efforts on three things: intensively carrying out the third weeding, collecting mountain goods, and turning over wheat fields.
　　[This newspaper, Neiqiu News] After the Shi Zhaizhuang village finished emergency planting after soaking rain, the village cadres stepped up the rush to weed the small seedlings. That evening, a mass meeting was held to determine the emergency weeding plan. The village has a total of ninety-four households, with two hundred and three male and female semi-laborers. All were mobilized to participate in the emergency weeding. The Farmers' Association chairman proposed that the soldiers at the front are fighting Jiang's bandits, and they are doing it for our old folks. Weed the military dependents' land before weeding our own land, and everyone agreed. Women's Federation cadre Han Baoyu said, "Women must also participate in the emergency weeding, using the emergency weeding to achieve equality with men." Women, children, and old men who had not participated in labor in the past also automatically participated in the emergency weeding. Yao Laoshan, who is seventy-three years old, played the role of a locomotive on the emergency weeding front. He still went to the fields early in the morning without understanding why, and returned home late at noon. Someone asked him, "You are so old, going to bed late, waking up early, and not resting at noon. Aren't you afraid of hurting your body?" He said, "It's cool in the morning, and I bask in the grass in the morning, and I hurry at night!" In the past, I wanted to work but had no land. The Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army helped us stand up and obtain many fruits such as land, waterwheels, carts, and cattle. Don't forget the tree planters when resting, and not working hard is letting down the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army." The masses gave him the nickname "Old Hand." The whole village emergency weeded a total of 463 mu in two days. (Shude, Chunshan, Yuzhen)

　　王家园互助大队精确计算
  　加紧锄苗抽工卖垧
    【本报太岳二十一日电】沁源王家园互助大队在锄二遍苗时，作了精确计算，抽出余工卖晌。他们在总结第一次锄苗后，便按各人技术重新分工，一、二分队四十三人，抽十二人搞其他生产，他们提出“早上地，迟回家，不歇晌，赶紧锄完咱的，好给人家干。”并规定锄苗工资米五升，大家的劲头很大。从六月二十一日开始，杜五儿组四个人一天锄玉茭十三亩半。一、二分队二十三人七天用二百六十一个工，即锄完全部玉茭、大麻、豆子、山药五百零三亩，平均每工锄三亩一分。接着四天内又锄完二百一十二亩八分苗，平均每工将近锄三亩，如果是个别劳动，每工只能锄二亩，这样工作效率就提高三分之一，因此在锄苗的七天中他们就能抽出二十三个青年到城关卖工三百四十五个，赚洋五万五千元。现大队又集中力量，突击进行锄三遍苗、采集山货和垡麦地三件事。
    【本报内邱讯】石翟庄落透雨抢种完毕后，村干部加紧抢锄小苗，当日晚召开群众大会，定出了抢锄计划，全村共九十四户，男女整半劳力二百零三个，一齐动员参加抢锄。农会主席提出前方战士打蒋贼，他是为咱老百姓，把军属的地锄完再锄自己的地，大家都很同意，妇救会干部韩保玉说：“妇女们也要参加抢锄，用抢锄与男人平等。”过去未参加过劳动的妇女、儿童、老头，也自动的参加了抢锄，七十三岁的姚老善，在抢锄战线上，起了火车头作用，他每天还不明就往地里走了，晌午回家很晚，别人问他你这么大的年纪，早起晚睡上午不休晌，你不怕身体被伤吗？他说：“早晨趁凉快，上午晒草哩，晚上赶了哩！”过去想劳动没有地，共产党八路军叫我们翻了身，得到土地、水车、大车、牛等很多果实，歇凉不忘栽树人，不努力生产对不住共产党八路军。”群众给他送外号叫他：“老干练”全村两天共抢锄四百六十三亩。（书德、春山、玉振）
