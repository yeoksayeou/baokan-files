Prices in the Border Region are generally stable and declining, while in Chiang Kai-shek's controlled areas, people are uneasy, frantically buying goods, leading to skyrocketing prices. In Tianjin, sesame oil reaches 13,200 yuan per jin (825 yuan per ounce), rice 7,900 yuan per jin (437 yuan per ounce), and gold reaches 2.5 million yuan per liang. A brief overview is as follows:

Grain: With successive rains in various areas for sowing, prices have fallen. However, the rains came late and were not widespread in Taihang and Taiyue, especially in Taihang and the fourth district of Taiyue (Yangcheng), Jin(cheng), and northern Henan, where there was a lack of rain. The summer and autumn harvests are expected to be poor, and the masses are preparing for famine and selling less grain, so prices are rising. In Jinnan, the Linqing and Weixian areas, where rainfall was more abundant, seedlings are about four feet tall. The wheat harvest in the Jiluyu area was better, so prices fell. In Puyang, the price of wheat fell by 13 yuan in eight days from the 18th to the 26th, affecting the steady decline in Jinnan. In late June, Handan transported tens of thousands of jin of grain in one day, but sales were low and prices fell (millet 125 yuan, wheat 125 yuan). Additionally, grain from Jinnan was continuously transported to Xingtai by merchants and the masses in order to slow the price decline; in late June, millet fell from 135 yuan to 104 yuan, and wheat fell from 144 yuan to 131 yuan. This trend reduced the eastward transport of grain from Taihang, stabilizing prices and creating a downward trend. Changzhi began to fall on the 26th, and by the 30th, wheat had fallen by 6.45 yuan per jin, with the actual price being 87 yuan. In Taiyue, millet was 75 yuan in Yangcheng. In the Jiyuan area, prices stabilized after rain in early July, with millet at 66.79 yuan. On the 25th, it was 37 yuan in Hekou, and wheat was 76 yuan in Jiyuan and 87 yuan in Heyong. Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas: After we liberated Cangxian, Tianjin was under martial law, and private grain purchases were prohibited. People panicked, rushing to buy goods and abandoning the legal currency, breaking through the Chiang Kai-shek party's price limit policies, and prices surged. On July 2nd, rice was 7,900 yuan per jin, up 2,900 yuan, millet 3,500 yuan, up 500 yuan, and Shoutong flour 265,000 yuan, up 35,000 yuan. In 29 days, millet rose by 1,300 yuan and rice by 3,200 yuan. In Beiping from the 24th to the 28th, rice rose from 5,900 to 6,800 yuan, and millet rose from 3,400 to 3,700 yuan. In Luoyang from the 7th to the 5th, wheat (per dou) rose by 8,050 yuan, with the current price being 30,000 yuan.

Cotton: Prices are generally rising, and cloth is following suit. The main reason is drought, leading to less sowing and wide sales. Jinan's tight monetary policy is suppressing prices, and exports from Linqing were once unfavorable. Later, attention was paid to being beneficial and measured. With a shortage of cotton in Jinan, air transport from Qingdao and Shanghai initially suppressed prices, from 820,000 - 900,000 - 960,000 - 1,050,000 yuan per hundred jin (29th). Cotton from Handan was not easily transported to southern Ningyang and instead trended to Dezhou, while cotton from Linqing still went to Dezhou, mainly to exchange for salt. Taihang cotton was transported to Taiyue, from northern Henan to Mengxian, Yancheng, Luoyang, and Xi'an, and Tongpu cotton was transported to the Luliang and Jin Sui areas. Taihang also launched a second textile campaign. Therefore, cotton prices in various places are rising. Cotton prices in the entire region have risen by 70-450 yuan, with the biggest increase in Zhaojie, Jiyuan, and the smallest increase in Xingtai. The current price is 1,400 yuan in Yuanjie, and 780-600 yuan per jin in Changzhi and Linqing, generally 480-530 yuan, with Handan being the lowest. After our smashing of the price suppression of cotton in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas, prices continued to rise. In Luoyang, cotton was 2,500 yuan higher in 20 days, from 11,000 to 13,000 yuan per jin from the 18th to the 26th. The price in Jinan rose by 2,300 yuan per jin, and in Tianjin it was 1.2 million yuan (per hundred jin).

Ironware: Ironware is selling well in the newly liberated areas of the second and third districts of Taiyue, and prices are rising. The fastest selling items are 1.8 chi and 1.6 chi cages, lids, flat basins, various nails (25, 35, 45, 70, etc.), bamboo pots, 1.7 chi, 1.8 chi, 8 and 10 yin black pots, frying spoons, heavy frying spoons, teapots, carts, etc. Various nails have risen by 120 yuan per jin, and 10 yin pots have risen by 1,000 yuan. Nails in Jicheng are 520 yuan per jin, and a 10 yin pot is 5,500 yuan. In Handan, because the freight for goods from Taiyue is high, there are fewer goods arriving, and prices are rising. Currently, the most popular items being sold are old stocks, such as iron shovels and 12,000 nails, which are widely sold in Guangping and Fei. 12,000 nails are 239 yuan, and equal nails are 240-245 yuan. In the Chiang Kai-shek controlled area of Luoyang, iron fell to 1,950 yuan on the 18th, compared to 350 yuan on the 7th.

Oils: Due to the busy farming season, production is low. Oil prices are high in friendly areas (Dezhou) and various areas controlled by Chiang Kai-shek, affecting price increases in our border areas. On the 25th, white sesame oil rose from 440 to 485 yuan per jin in Hengshui, and to 580 yuan in Linqing. In Miaojie, Jiyuan, prices rose in early July, and were 1,300-1,400 yuan in mid-late July, a difference of 440 yuan. Prices began to fall in late July, ending at 1,000-1,200 yuan. In Chiang Kai-shek's Tianjin, sesame oil rose from 8,900 to 13,200 yuan on the 30th, an increase of 32%, and white oil rose from 7,000 to 9,400 yuan, an increase of over 34%. In Beiping from the 24th to the 26th, sesame oil rose from 11,500 to 13,300 yuan, an increase of 20%, and white oil rose from 8,200 to 8,700 yuan, an increase of 6%.

Foreign Goods: After our army captured Cangxian, Tianjin was under martial law, and goods were difficult to export. Furthermore, after our army went south, imports stopped, affecting the stable rise of some goods prices in the border region. Now, foreign goods are being continuously imported, with matches, gasoline, and newspapers being the main items, and prices are falling. Nanjing matches continued to fall, with a difference of 2,000-8,000 yuan. The fall was greater in Xingtai and Handan, and less in Linqing. The current price is 68,000-51,500 yuan, with the highest price in Changzhi and the lowest in Linqing, generally 53,000-54,000 yuan. Changzhi began to fall on the 20th, dropping from 70,000 yuan to 68,000 yuan by the end of the month. Gasoline is 2,000 yuan in Linqing and 1,400 yuan in Handan. Dyes, refined white sugar, and groceries are actively rising. Fast indigo in Handan is 170,000 yuan, a difference of 70,000 yuan, and white sugar is 1,550 yuan. Linqing entered a rising trend on the 27th, with boiled indigo rising from 11,000 to 12,000 yuan, and rising again to 12,500 yuan in one day. The grain and oil shortages and soaring prices in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas affected the rise of other goods. Sunshine cloth rose from 345,000 to 448,000 yuan, an increase of 29.8%, and newspapers from our factory rose from 223,000 to 250,000 yuan. Mobil oil rose from 700,000 to 1,000,000-1,050,000 yuan (30th). In Luoyang, it rose from 380,000 to 420,000 yuan.

Finance: The financial situation has been relatively sluggish in recent months. Gold is stable, and the legal currency exchange rate is weakening. The official gold price in Handan remained unchanged at 80,000 yuan in the upper and middle ten days of the month. In early late July, it advanced to 85,000 yuan. The black market rose from 110,000 to 120,000 yuan. Exports from Linqing were unfavorable, and the legal currency exchange rate once rose to 9 fen 1 li. Starting in the middle ten days of the month, prices rose in Jinan due to the air transport of cotton, and Linqing had more exports, so the exchange rate fell. Due to the martial law in Tianjin, goods were difficult to export, and the exchange rate fell more. The exchange rate in Jinan fell less. The fall began on the 16th and ended on the 22nd, with a difference of 7 li in the Tianjin exchange rate and 3 li in the Jinan exchange rate. From the 27th to the 1st, the Jinan exchange rate fell from 8 fen 8 li to 7 fen 4 li. In Nangong, the exchange rate fell from 8 fen 8 li to 7 fen 8 li in six days from the 20th to the 26th, a difference of 4 li in 20 days. The situation in Handan has not changed. The official price in Jiyuan is 1 jiao, and the black market price of 8 fen 5 li has not changed. The black market price of silver fell from 1,100 to 900 yuan. Chiang Kai-shek controlled area Gold: The price in Tianjin was 2,500,000-2,600,000 yuan on the 25th, rising to 3,500,000 yuan on the 5th, an increase of 40%. In Luoyang, the price rose from 1,850,000 to 2,000,000 yuan on the 26th, an increase of over 8%.
