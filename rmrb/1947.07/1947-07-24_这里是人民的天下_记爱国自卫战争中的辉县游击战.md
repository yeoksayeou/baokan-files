　　Here is the People's World
　　--A Record of the Hui County Guerrilla Warfare in the Patriotic Self-Defense War
　　One Year of Bloody Battle, Seeing the Blue Sky Again
　　Before the ceasefire order (October 1945), the Hui County city, which the people had seized from the Japanese invaders, was soon invaded by the Chiang army. They obscured the blue sky and, led by Chiang Kai-shek special agent and local tyrant Guan ChaoYan, organized the "Returning Home Corps" of fleeing landlords to attack the people. The local Party leadership of Hui County organized the local people's struggle to defend their land. The result of a year of bloody battle was that the growth of the people's power was much faster than originally expected:
　　Population: The Chiang puppet regime initially controlled 250,000, now it only controls 50,000.
　　Area: The Chiang puppet regime initially controlled two-thirds, now it only controls the villages within ten miles around the city.
　　The people's armed forces have been unprecedentedly strengthened: Militia: 300 at the beginning of the invasion, developed to 2,000 before the land distribution, and expanded to 5,000 after the land distribution. Local backbone armed forces have also greatly developed. Not only has the county and district established backbone armed forces detached from production, but they also have strong combat capabilities.
　　The Chiang puppet forces had to disintegrate under this situation; the landlord armed forces organized by Guan ChaoYan collapsed from 2,000 to 500, and the seven district public offices became three, completely shrinking into the city and highway strongholds. The guns of the village landlord armed liaison associations were completely disarmed by the people. (The above are all statistics from June).
　　The people of Hui County won victory with their own bravery, wit, and fearless sacrifice, and the blue sky reappeared above their heads.
　　The Turning Point of the Struggle – From Fear to Fearlessness
　　The Chiang puppet regime's crazy rule and suppression, combined with the landlord special agent armed forces, could only intimidate the people for a while. When the Chiang army first arrived, some people had the idea of relying on the main force to fight for the world. They were also pessimistic and disappointed about the Chiang army's massacres and plunder. However, this situation quickly changed. The leadership, with the armed plainclothes team as the backbone, organized the withdrawal of the militia to their homes to carry out a revenge movement. The first retaliatory offensive focused on local diehards. Guan ChaoYan's intelligence team was sent out in the morning and killed in the afternoon. Nine bad guys were caught in the south of the city at one time. Guo Xing, the district chief of Chengguan District, led the most active working team. While fighting bad guys, they publicly convened mass meetings to support the basic masses, let them complain, and if they dared not speak out clearly, they could report secretly to eliminate harm for them. After the meeting, the masses reflected: "This is really having the blue sky!" Using the same method, the enemy could not even catch conscripts. We openly told the BaoZhang: "If you catch someone from whose family, you, the BaoZhang, are responsible!" The BaoZhang had to say to the enemy: "The west side won't let you catch! If you catch someone, you'll have to pay with your life." The stubborn district chief said: "Take it easy! Who can do it for a few lifetimes?" A bad guy who had been running for five years in Chengguan was caught back. Yu River killed the enemy's new company commander… This series of events had a great impact. Everyone became more and more courageous. Not only did they use various methods to deceive and scare the enemy, but they also mobilized the masses to deceive. Once, Guo Xing's working team ambushed on the edge of the city's rural experimental field. When they didn't encounter the enemy, they built many fake fortifications on the spot, including individual bunkers, machine gun positions… The enemy was extremely frightened when they came out. They opened fire as soon as they saw it. The local masses saw that the enemy was afraid and told the enemy: "The Eighth Route Army has brought several regiments, and there is also a cavalry regiment." The enemy dared not move forward and retreated. Since then, many villages have learned to distribute propaganda materials for us while saying: "Look! The Eighth Route Army spent the night last night, and the dog kept barking…" The enemy really became suspicious again. The paper tiger of the Chiang family army was exposed, and the masses had more and more ways to deal with the Chiang army.
　　Crushing the Chiang Army's Three Raids
　　After last year's autumn harvest, the Chiang army's main force, the 32nd Division, cooperated with the stubborn puppet armed forces to launch three attacks, attempting to occupy BoBi and control the mountains in order to seize grain. Our county independent regiment, militia, district cadres, and working teams fully and effectively cooperated to crush the enemy's raids. The backbone regiment frontally blocked the enemy's attack, the militia in the hinterland cooperated to organize night attacks, and the district cadres and militia in the border areas took advantage of the enemy's attack on the hinterland to vigorously burn blockhouses. On October 21, the joint defense militia of the Fifth District extended into Wangcunpu and burned three enemy blockhouses. The militia of the Sixth District burned four blockhouses in Gongzhuang, five miles away from Hui County city. The militia of Yu River and Mazhuang took the initiative to attack, killing and wounding 16 enemy soldiers in three days… The enemy's social order behind enemy lines was disrupted, and the attacking forces encountered our main force and militia. After a series of attacks, they had to flee in embarrassment.
　　After the end of the counter-raid, a heated land investigation and distribution movement was launched in the mountains and plains. The masses five or six miles away from the enemy got up to distribute land. The peasants distributed land while carrying guns. The working team members were the liberated peasants. The backbone regiment, district cadres, and militia were all strengthened. From November to December, the local armed forces launched a comprehensive attack. In mid-November, they raided Zhao Tun and ambushed Liu River, annihilating all the returning home corps in both attacks. At the beginning of December, they took advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness to attack He Tun (Xinxiang), burning 26 enemy vehicles and 76 barrels of gasoline. The security regiment woke up in a dream and 11 people were captured. The district cadres of the Ninth District cooperated in the operation, burning 22 enemy blockhouses overnight. This year, they also fought three battalion annihilation battles, eliminated the puppet district public offices, recovered Zhao Gu, and annihilated the Zhao Tun district public office. From then on, the guerrilla activities in the whole county were completely active. We can attack wherever we want! The enemy will run into a wall wherever they attack.
　　Resolutely, decisively, thoroughly and completely eliminate the stubborn puppet traitorous rule
　　Over the past year, the county independent regiment has captured 103 members of the security regiment and 102 members of the returning home corps, and the militia themselves have arrested many. Attacking the landlord returning home corps is the urgent demand of the masses, and it is also an important part of ensuring the development of guerrilla warfare and isolating the enemy. The county leadership has adopted a firm and clear policy in this regard. After the Chiang army occupied Hui County, it generally restored the organization of the liaison association. When the independent regiment attacked Zhao Gu in January, Guo Xing's working team disguised themselves as enemies who had escaped from Zhao Gu and went to Ge Zhuang to find the BaoZhang, saying: "The Eighth Route Army is fighting very fiercely in the north. You should go to help." The village's liaison association gathered three people with three guns and more than a dozen rows of bullets, which were all captured by us. Under the conditions of our military offensive winning victory after victory, on the one hand, we ordered the liaison association to hand in their guns, and on the other hand, we chose key targets to attack. The liaison association in Fanzhuang in Chengguan District was the strongest. The district chief led the working team and more than 70 militiamen, expanded their momentum, carried stretchers, as if they were going to fight a big battle, and first went to Nan Yaogu Village Street to rest. They sent someone to call the BaoZhang of Fan Village. The district chief said: "We will first confiscate the guns of your village's liaison association. If you don't hand them in, we won't talk about it this time. We have to fight." He pretended to deploy the team and deliberately let the BaoZhang hear it. When the BaoZhang saw that the situation was not good, he immediately handed in 11 guns. Then the guns of the surrounding liaison associations were all confiscated. According to statistics in early February this year, most of the 101 rifles captured by the militia came from the liaison association, which greatly armed ourselves. The people have fully realized from the struggles of the past year that the social foundation of the landlord traitors is not strong and cannot be pulled out. With courage, wit, and a firm policy, its rule can be completely destroyed.
　　Indestructible Joint Defense Fortress
　　From the struggle, the masses of Hui County have established their own joint defense organization. This kind of joint defense completely breaks the restrictions of the district or administrative village, and is organized according to the convenience of fighting against the enemy and communicating intelligence. If something happens in one village, they will support each other. Each village also built self-defense fortifications. When the militia goes to support other villages, the self-defense team can still repel the attacking enemy with soil guns and fortifications. On July 8, more than a thousand enemies from Hui County city attacked six villages including Shangxiatai Village. The militia of nine villages, including Shezhang and Gaozhuang, counterattacked the enemy's charge once to eight times. The militia of Yangquan and other villages also organized support. This kind of swarm-style militia guerrilla warfare repelled the enemy that night. Each district also formed three strong guerrilla groups according to the conditions of fighting against the enemy, in order to unify the strength of each joint defense and take the initiative to annihilate the enemy when the opportunity arises. In the wheat harvest counter-grain grabbing, the unified ambush in Su Gelou annihilated 28 enemies. Under this situation, the mobile combat strength of the county independent regiment was greatly enhanced. It could eliminate the invading army at any time, and it could also take the initiative to find the enemy to fight.
　　The county independent regiment, district backbone team, working team, militia, self-defense team and all other people's armed organizations have united into a copper wall and iron wall. Wherever the enemy attacks from, they will be eliminated there.
　　The Brilliant Achievements of Chairman Mao's Thought
　　The reason why Hui County has achieved great results in the development of guerrilla warfare in the past year is due to the skillful application of Chairman Mao's thought on the following issues:
　　First, the army and the local area are closely united, and the unified leadership of the Party is established. A very important experience here is that the troops and the local area must be unified in ideology, especially in tactical thinking. Not only is the purpose of the attack the same, but the focus of the attack is first placed on the returning home corps. The method of fighting is to divide the work and cooperate. The militia and the district cadres try to fight independently as much as possible to create mobile combat conditions for the county independent regiment. It is mutual support and help, not mutual complaints. This unity has formed a force to inflict heavy blows on the enemy. Secondly, the leadership can always pay attention to proactively solving difficulties with each other. The organization can achieve true concurrent posts. Hui County has done a good job in this regard, which is very important to the guarantee of unified leadership.
　　The second is to infinitely unleash the creativity of the masses. Whether it is the working team, the militia, or the backbone regiment, they all pay attention to giving play to the mass line and defeating the enemy with the wisdom of the masses. When the enemy first occupied Hui County, the leadership once concentrated the militia, not believing that the militia could fight on its own, but this method was quickly changed. The masses learned the skills of fighting the enemy from action, and at the same time improved their awareness. When this leadership method is widely used in all aspects, it will unleash infinite power. (Ding @ Compiled)

　　这里是人民的天下
    ——记爱国自卫战争中的辉县游击战
  　一年血战，再见青天
    停战令前（四五年十月），人民从日寇手中夺回的辉县城，旋即被蒋军侵陷了。他们一手遮住青天，以蒋特为首的地主奸霸头子关朝彦，组织逃亡地主“还乡团”，向人民开刀。辉县地方党领导与组织了当地人民的自卫保田斗争，一年血战的结果，人民力量的生长，比起原来预料的要快得多：
    人口：蒋伪初侵陷时控制二十五万，现仅控制五万。
    面积：蒋伪初侵陷时控制三分之二，现仅控制城关周围十里内之村庄。
    人民武装力量空前壮大了：民兵：初侵陷时三百人，分田前发展到二千，分田后扩大到五千。地方基干兵团，也大大发展了，县区脱离生产的基干武装不仅建立起来，而且有坚强作战能力。
    蒋伪力量在这种情况下不得不土崩瓦解；关朝彦所组织的地主武装由二千垮到五百，七个区公所变成了三个，完全缩到城内与公路据点上。各村地主武装联庄会的枪，完全向人民缴械了。（以上均系六月份统计）。
    辉县人民以自己的勇敢、机智、不怕流血牺牲坚决斗争，赢得了胜利，头顶上重新现出了青天。
    斗争的转捩点——由恐惧到无畏
    蒋伪结合地主特务武装的疯狂统治与镇压，只能唬吓人民于一时，蒋军乍到，一部分人中间有过依靠主力打天下思想，对蒋军的屠杀抢掠，也有过悲观失望情绪，但这种情况很快就改变了，领导上以武装便衣队为骨干组织了撤出民兵回家开展复仇运动。第一次的复仇攻势打击的重点是土顽，关朝彦的谍报队上午派出来下午即被打死；一次在城南就捉了九个坏蛋。城关区郭兴区长所领导的武工队最活跃，他们一面打坏蛋，一面公开召集群众大会，给基本群众撑腰，让他们诉苦，不敢明诉可以暗告，替他们除害；会后群众反映：“这可是有青天了！”用同样的方法，敌人连壮丁也抓不到了，我们公开告保长说：“抓了谁家，你保长负责！”保长不得不去对敌人说：“西边不让抓！抓了要对命。”顽区长说：“马马虎虎吧！谁还能干几辈子？”城关跑了五年的坏蛋被捉回来了，峪河打死敌新兵连长…………这一连串的事件，影响很大。大家越干胆子越大，不仅自己用各种办法欺骗敌人吓唬敌人，而且发动起群众来欺骗，一次郭兴武工队在城边农村试验场打埋伏，未遇敌人便在该地筑了很多假工事，有单人掩体，机枪工事…………敌人出来害怕极了，一见就开枪，当地群众看清敌人害怕，便告敌人说：“八路军来了好几团，还有骑兵团。”敌人不敢再前进，就退回去了。此后许多村庄都学会了，一面替我们散发宣传品，一面说：“你看！八路军昨晚过了一夜，狗一直咬…………”敌人果真又半信半疑起来。蒋家军的纸老虎被揭穿了，群众对付蒋军的办法也就越来越多了。
    粉碎蒋军三次扫荡
    去年秋收后蒋军主力三十二师配合顽伪武装曾三次进攻，企图占领薄壁，控制山地，以便抢粮。我县独立团、民兵、区干队、武工队，全面有力配合，粉碎了敌人扫荡。基干兵团正面阻击敌人进攻，腹地民兵配合组织夜袭，边地区干队、民兵趁敌进攻腹地空隙，大力烧炮楼。十月二十一日五区联防民兵伸入王村铺烧敌炮楼三个。六区民兵在辉县城附近五里路之宫庄烧炮楼四个，峪河、马庄民兵主动出击，三天内毙伤敌十六名…………，敌后敌人的社会秩序被打乱了，进攻兵力又遇我主力及民兵，一连打击，不得不狼狈窜回。
    反扫荡结束后，山地、平原开展了热轰轰的查田、分田运动，距敌五、六里地方的群众都起来分田了，农民们一面分田，一面背枪，武工队员就是翻身队员，基干团、区干队、民兵都壮大了。从十一月到十二月，地方武装组织全面出击，十一月中旬，奇袭赵屯、伏击刘河，两次把还乡团悉数歼灭，十二月初趁敌不备袭入何屯（新乡），烧敌汽车二十六辆，汽油七十六桶，保安团梦中惊醒，被俘十一名，九区区干队配合行动，一夜烧敌炮楼二十二座。今年又打了三位营歼灭战，消灭伪区公所，收复了赵固，歼灭了赵屯区公所。从此全县的游击活动完全主动了，我们要打那里就打那里！敌人打那里那里碰壁。
    坚决干脆彻底完全消灭顽伪奸霸统治
    一年来县独立团俘虏保安团一百零三人，还乡团一百零二人，民兵自己逮捕的也不少。打击地主还乡团，是群众的迫切要求，同时也是保证游击战的开展与孤立敌人的一个重要环节。县领导上在这方面是采取了坚定明确的方针的。蒋军占领辉县后，曾普遍恢复联庄会的组织；一月份独立团打赵固时，郭兴武工队伪装赵固逃出来的敌人到圪庄找保长说：“北边八路军打的很厉害，你们快去援助。”该村联庄会集合了三个人三枝枪，十几排子弹，被我全部缴获。在我军事出击节节胜利的条件下，一面命令联庄会交枪，一面选择重点打击，在城关区范庄的联庄会最强，区长带着武工队、民兵七十余人，扩张声势，带着担架，象是要打大仗，先到南姚固村街休息，派人把范村的保长叫来，区长表示说：“先会缴过你村联庄会的枪，你不缴，这次不谈了，非打不可。”说着便伪装布置队伍，又故意叫保长听见，保长一见情况不妙，便立即把十一枝枪缴出来，接着周围的联庄会的枪都缴了，今年二月初统计，民兵所缴获的一百零一枝步枪，大部来自联庄会，这样就大大的武装了自己。人民从一年来的斗争中已完全认识到地主奸霸的社会基础，并不是强固不可拔的，有勇敢、有机智，又有坚定的方针就能完全摧毁它的统治。
    打不烂摧不垮的联防堡垒
    从斗争中，辉县群众自己建立了自己的联防组织，这种联防完全打破了区，或行政村的限制，而依据对敌作战，互通情报的便利组织的，一村有事，互相支援。各村并筑有自卫工事。民兵出援他村，自卫队利用土枪及工事仍能击退突击敌人。七月八日，辉县城敌千余出犯上下台村等六村，舍章、高庄等九村民兵反击敌一次至八次冲锋，羊圈等村民兵又组织支援，这种一窝蜂的民兵游击战，当天晚上就击退了敌人。各区又按对敌斗争的条件，结合组成了三个强有力的游击集团，以便统一各联防力量，遇机主动歼敌，麦收反抢粮中，在苏圪楼的统一设伏，歼敌二十八人。在这种情况下，大大增强了县独立团机动作战力量，能随时消灭进犯军，也能主动寻找敌人作战。
    县独立团、区基干队，武工队、民兵，自卫队等所有的人民的武装组织，就这样联合成一道铜墙铁壁，敌人从那里进攻，就把他消灭在那里。
    毛主席思想的光辉成就
    辉县一年来在游击战争的开展上所以获得了很大的成绩，是由于在以下的问题上，纯熟地运用了毛主席思想：
    第一军队、地方亲密团结，树立了党的一元化领导。这里很重要的一个经验是必须部队、地方在思想上特别是战术思想上的统一。不但打击的目的是一致的，而且把打击的重点先放在还乡团上。打的方法是分工合作，民兵、区干队尽量单独作战，给县独立团造成机动作战条件；是相互支援帮助，而不是相互埋怨。这种统一，便形成了痛击敌人的力量。其次在领导上能经常注意相互主动解决困难；组织上能做到真正兼权兼职。辉县在这方面都做得很好，这在一元化领导的保证上均是十分重要的。
    第二是无限发挥群众创造力。无论是武工队、民兵也好，基干兵团也好，都注意发挥群众路线，以群众的智慧打败敌人。当敌人初占辉县时，领导上曾把民兵集中起来，不相信民兵能自己作战，但很快的就改变了这种办法。群众从行动中锻炼出打敌人的本领，同时也提高了觉悟。当这一领导方法普遍运用在各个环节上时，就发挥了无穷的力量。（丁＠整理）
