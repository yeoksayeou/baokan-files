　　Killing Pests and Protecting Seedlings
  　People in Various Regions Display Creativity
    [Report from this newspaper] The weather is severely dry, and various pests are harming the young seedlings. Currently, various regions have organized the masses to catch and kill them. In Shenjiajiao, Zuoquan, the amount of young seedlings eaten by raccoon dogs and rats each year exceeds the amount of grain paid as public tax. Now that the seedlings have just been hoed for the first time, raccoon dogs and rats are swarming and damaging half an acre to one acre of seedlings every day. In order to protect the seedlings, the masses have organized a 13-person rat extermination team, using homemade guns to shoot them. In places like Shibao Village and Songshuping, people are also digging rat holes, propping up stones to hit raccoon dogs, and stipulating reward methods for capturing and killing pests and wild animals: a reward of 2,000 yuan for killing a wild boar, and 4 fen (1 fen equals 5 he of rice) for killing a raccoon dog or a rat. The bonus will be distributed according to the acreage of land in the whole village. In the second district of Lincheng, armyworms have been discovered, which specialize in eating and damaging rice seedlings. When the seedlings grow to three leaves, the stems are bitten off at ground level. According to incomplete statistics from six villages, more than 400 mu have been eaten. The masses have invented many methods to control insects: (1) When sowing seeds, dig ditches in the field first and water them with more rainwater to harden the soil, which can reduce insect damage. (2) Mix sesame beans with the rice seeds to prevent the rice seedlings from being eaten, and the other two types of seeds can still be left. (3) Rub the seeds with alum, tung oil, and sesame oil, so that the seedlings that grow out have a bitter taste, and the insects will not eat them. Oil aphids are commonly found harming young cotton in Yuci and Yuanshe. According to the experience of various places, the only way to treat oil aphids is to soak the seedlings, some with medicinal essence water, some with tobacco leaf water, and some with root of Chinese Toon and chili water. It is easy to treat when the seedlings are small. Generally, soaking them once can eliminate them. It is more difficult after the seedlings grow larger. One treatment is not enough, and they must be soaked twice.

　　杀虫·护苗
  　各地群众发挥创造
    【本报讯】天气亢旱，各种害虫危害青苗，现各地已组织群众捕打。左权申家峧每年貉狑老鼠食害青苗之产量比公粮数还大。现在小苗才锄过头遍，貉狑老鼠成群结队，每天危害青苗达半亩到一亩。群众为保护青苗，已组织起十三人的灭鼠队，拿土枪打。石暴村、松树坪等地也都在刨老鼠窟窿，支石头拍打貉狑并规定奖励捕杀害虫、野兽办法：打一只山猪奖洋二千元，打一个貉狑一个老鼠订四分（一分折五合米），奖金按全村地亩摊派。临城二区发现扫青虫，专食害谷苗，在苗长三个叶时，在地面上苗茎咬断，据六个村不完全统计，现已吃光四百余亩。治虫办法，群众已发明很多：（一）下种时将地里先串成沟，多浇雨水，使土变硬，可减少虫害。（二）谷种里掺上芝麻豆子，以防谷苗吃掉还可剩下其他两种。（三）将种籽用明矾与柏油麻油搓一下，这样长出的青苗有苦味，虫就不吃。榆社元氏普遍发现油旱伤害幼棉，据各地经验，治油旱唯一办法就是浸苗、有的用药精水，有的用烟叶水，还有的用椿树根与辣椒水。苗小时易治，普遍浸沾一次就可消灭掉，苗大后就费劲，一次治不完，还须浸二次。
