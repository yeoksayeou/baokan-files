The sky still wouldn't rain.

I deliberately teased a few elderly people, saying, "Aren't you going to hurry up and burn incense and kowtow?" The reply was, "Tsk, Comrade Du, do you still want to keep the feudal remnants?!" I wanted to challenge them from the perspective of natural phenomena—to see the depth of their ideological changes. So I asked, "If there are no gods, why does the wind sometimes blow, sometimes it rains, and sometimes there's thunder?"

"The yin and yang energies interact!" The one who answered was Granny Bao, who had been superstitious her whole life and was nearly seventy years old this year. She couldn't fully explain various natural phenomena, but she affirmed, "No matter what, I just don't believe in those dead spirits anymore!" Three days ago, she personally tore up the old Kitchen God she had served her whole life, used the god's shrine to start a fire, and kicked the broken clay bodhisattva into the manure pile. She said, "I've served you my whole life, and what have you given me? If it weren't for the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party, I would have starved to death long ago, without even a place to be buried!" She had spent most of her life moving from house to house, and once the landlord Su Richang saw her living there, he yelled, pointing fingers, "Who let her lie here? In a few days, when she dies, see who will clean up? ... Even the donkey pen and pigsty don't have such a stench!" So Granny Bao was kicked out again. Fortunately, "the poor are close to the poor," and Granny Gu Xi took her in. When the Eighth Route Army came and implemented reasonable burdens and disaster relief production, Granny Bao thought, "These people are really good!" But there was always a worry in her heart. The old woman often thought: "I've lived my whole life without even getting a place to live. If I really die one day, will I be buried in someone else's house? Alas!"

"Chairman Mao and the Communist Party are leading us so well. He knows everything in the hearts of the people. Since the land reform last autumn, filling in the gaps and making up the deficiencies, those who wanted to farm had land, and those who didn't have houses got houses." Granny Bao got half a room all to herself, with half a loft. Recently, after the thorough re-examination, she was confirmed to move in. Lying on the kang at night, she looked at the flat loft floor, and there was nothing more pleasant than this. The few acres of distant land she had turned over in the past were now exchanged for nearby land. When the village organized mutual aid teams, they even said they would especially take care of the lonely and widowed. "This world is so good, all thanks to our Communist Party and Chairman Mao. From now on, I will hang Chairman Mao's portrait and never look at those dead spirits again." Granny Bao and a few other old women talked about it that night in the "Farmer's Truth University (referring to the Farmers' Association)," and the next day they got up early to destroy the idols. When they went to the street to buy Chairman Mao's portrait, the shops had not yet opened.

The elderly people talked about people instead of ghosts and gods. Some said Chairman Mao is Chairman Mao, some said Chairman Mao is the eldest, the Communist Party is the second, and the Eighth Route Army is the third. Some said Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the Eighth Route Army are just one person with three names, each with their own reasons, but the most common understanding is: Chairman Mao is the supreme leader. In the discussion, someone suddenly raised another question:

"I don't know if we should burn incense or not?"

Everyone paused and looked at the short, stout woman who spoke. She was Granny Zhang Fuzhen, the family member of a soldier, and had been "skilled in Taoism" for many years. She continued to state her opinion, saying:

"I'm not talking about superstition, it's just that Chairman Mao is so good, I don't know how to respect him!" She said that she used to listen to the landlord's mute daughter-in-law, "Cultivate this life to cultivate the next life," and followed her "flower firewood Tao," supporting the altar and sitting up at night every day, but in the end, she even sold a few acres of land for incense money. Now, she neither burns incense nor sits up at night, and she has land and a house, and food is immediately distributed when there is nothing to eat. "What bodhisattvas and immortals are all the lackeys of the landlords, helping the rich to exploit the poor!"

"Don't you remember how 'Toad' got his start?" People remembered the landlord Yang Yuhuai who lived next to the big pond and his rich shop, and also remembered his "touching Tao," relying on his gang of "dead lackeys," the old "Toads," and the young "Toads," who earned a lot of incense money every year, and then lent it out at high interest in the pawnshop, slowly merging the land of the farmers (many of whom were his Taoist disciples) into his name, while pretending to be good people on the surface.

"Hai!" The middle peasant old man Fu Yueqi sighed a long breath. He said that in the past, because he was a suffering headman, he was directed by landlords, bullies, and rich peasants like "Street Tiger" Wang Mingyi to collect grain and money from the homes of middle peasants and poor peasants, while the landlords and rich peasants did not contribute at all in the form of selling grain silver, or at most only a little rotten grain. When the Kuomintang Central Army's "leather coat team" came, they didn't like him, and hit him with a stick. From then on, the old man became a madman, silly and unsteady, avoiding people when he saw them. People said that he was haunted by wild ghosts, but in fact, the ghosts were on the landlords and officials. Since the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party came, they first implemented reasonable burdens and abolished oppression; Old Yueqi felt lighter in his heart, and slowly, slowly, his madness also healed. Since the thorough elimination of feudalism in the land reform last autumn, his heart has become even more joyful. He said: "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are truly worthy of being living gods, and they have also captured the wild ghost in my heart!" When the people follow Chairman Mao, the doomsday of gods and ghosts arrives.

　　神鬼的末日
    任村“土地还家”散记
    展潮
    天还是不下雨。
    我故意逗几个老年人说：“还不赶快烧香叩头？”回答是：“唏，杜同志你还想留封建尾巴哩？！”我想从自然现象上去难为他们——看看他们或她们思想变化的深度。便问：“你说没有老爷，为啥有时刮风，有时下雨，有时还响唿雷？”
    “阴阳两气相接嘛”！回答的是迷信了一辈子，今年快七十高龄的包他娘。他不能完满地说明各种自然现象，却肯定的说：“不管怎，俺就是不信那些死神灵啦！”三天前，她亲手把供了一辈子的老灶爷撕毁，拿神位去烘火，将摔碎了的泥菩萨踢到粪堆里。她说：“俺白侍候了你一辈子，你给了俺啥？要不是八路军共产党来了，俺早就饿死啦，连个停尸的地方也没有！”好整整窜了多半辈子房檐，从这家搬到那家，有次地主苏日昌看见她住在那儿，指鸡骂狗地嚷了一阵说：“谁让她躺在这里？过几天停尸，看你们谁来收拾？………连驴圈猪圈都没有这股恶臭气！”就这样包他娘便又被赶出来了。总算是“穷人见穷人亲”，谷喜他娘把她收容到自己家里住下。八路军来了办合理负担，搞救灾生产，包他娘心想“这干人实在不赖啊！”但是总有一块心病没去了，老太婆常好想：活了一辈子，连个住处都没弄上，有朝一日当真死了，就在人家屋子里入殓吗？唉！”
    共产党毛主席领导得真好。老百姓心里有啥事他都知道，打去年秋天闹土地改革填平补齐起，想种地的人有了地，没有房子的人得了房子，包他娘一个人分了半间屋，还带半截楼。最近闹深入复查，确定让她搬进去了，黑夜躺在坑上，她眼看着平坦坦的楼板，再没有比这痛快的了。过去翻身的几亩远地这回也换成近地啦，村里碰互助组的时候，还说特别要照顾孤寡人，“这个世道真好啊，全亏咱们共产党毛主席。自今往后俺要挂毛主席像，再不想看那些死神灵了。”包他娘和其他几个老太婆那天晚上在“农民真理大学（指农会）”里说了说，第二天不明就起来毁神像，当他们到街买毛主席像的时候，店铺还没有开门。
    老年人从鬼、神谈到人，有人说毛主席就是毛主席，有人说毛主席是老大，共产党是老二，八路军是老三，有人说毛主席、共产党、八路军只是一个人起了三个名罢了，各有各的理由，但是最普遍的认识是：毛主席是总头目。谈论中，突然有人提出另外一个问题：
    “不知道叫烧香不叫？”
    大家楞了一下看那个讲话的矮胖女人，她是军属张富镇他娘，“在道行好”多年。她继续申述自己意见说：
    “俺不是讲迷信，实在毛主席太好了，不知怎样敬他才好！”她说她过去听信地主哑巴媳妇的话：“不修今生修来生”，在了她的“花柴道”，天天扶坛坐夜，到头来连几亩地也卖了给香钱。现在既不烧香也不坐夜，有了地有了房子，没吃的当下就分给粮食。“什么菩萨、神仙，都是一干地主的狗腿，帮助老财剥削穷人！”
    “你们不记得‘蛤蟆’是样起家的？”人们想起住在大池旁边的地主杨毓淮和他的富店，同时也想起他的“摸摸道”，凭着他这伙“死狗腿”，老“蛤蟆”，小“蛤蟆”们每年收入不少香钱，然后放到当店里高利贷出去，慢慢地把农民（很多是他的道徒们）的土地都兼并到他名下，明面上还装做好人。
    “嗨！”中农老汉傅月其长长地嘘了一口气。他说他过去因为当那个受气甲长，整天被地主恶霸富农“进街虎”王鸣仪等支使，上中农贫农家里起粮起款，地主老财们却以卖粮银等方式不出分毫，至多也只出一点烂粮食。国民党中央军的“皮袄队”来了不兴他，劈头就是一棒，老汉从此以后便成为疯子，傻傻颠颠的，见人就躲。人们都说是野鬼缠身了，其实鬼就在地主老官身上。自从八路军共产党来了，首先来个合理负担，废除压迫；老月其心上才轻快起来，慢慢地慢慢地，疯病也好了。去秋闹土地改革彻底消灭封建以来，心里就越发痛快。他说：“共产党毛主席真称的起活神们，把我心里这个野鬼也捉走啦！”当人民跟着毛主席走的时候，神鬼就到临了末日。
