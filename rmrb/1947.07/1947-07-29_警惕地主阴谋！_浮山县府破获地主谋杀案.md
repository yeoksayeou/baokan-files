　　Beware of Landlord Conspiracies!
　　Fushan County Government Uncovers Landlord Murder Case
　　[Our newspaper, Taiyue, 27th dispatch] Landlords in Zhongcun, Fushan County, plotted to beat a Farmers' Association cadre to death. During the mass movement last year in Zhongcun, due to errors in classifying class status, many landlords infiltrated the Farmers' Association. For example, the landlord Bai Qingzhen managed to become the chairman of the Farmers' Association, Chen Maobai became the instructor of the Militia Committee, and Chen Dianqing became the village head. They controlled the village government, shielded landlords, and although land had been formally distributed after struggle sessions, the masses were never truly mobilized. In September of last year, Chiang's troops reoccupied Fushan City, and Bai Qingzhen and others colluded with the enemy, acting as informants. In December, when our army was preparing to ambush the enemy in the area, Bai Qingzhen sent his "running dog" Bai Qinglin to report to the enemy in the city. Chen Dianqing became a puppet company commander, and Chen Maobai became a puppet secretary. In May of this year, our army recaptured Fushan County, and land reform was relaunched in the village, but class status had still not been clarified, and Chen Maobai and others continued to work in the Farmers' Association, claiming to be "atoning for their crimes." Activist Wei Zijian, a basic member of the masses, constantly exposed Bai Qingzhen's and others' conspiracies to shield landlords, led the masses in struggle, became a Farmers' Association cadre, and became a thorn in the side of Bai Qingzhen and others, who constantly plotted to murder him, falsely accusing Wei Zijian everywhere of stealing people's hemp and sheep. Bai Qingzhen had an affair with Li Ying'e, and on June 25th, Wei Zijian led the masses to catch them in the act. Bai Qingzhen then instigated Li Ying'e to falsely accuse Wei Zijian of threatening to rape her with a hand grenade, going to the masses to complain in order to take the opportunity to beat him to death. Bai Qingzhen even shamelessly told Li Ying'e to prepare a torn pair of pants as evidence. On June 29th, Bai Qingzhen convened the first reactionary meeting, assigning tasks to everyone. On the 2nd of this month, at the second gathering, Bai Qingzhen and Chen Maobai threatened all their accomplices and established discipline. Then, while the masses were holding a meeting, they rushed into the meeting place. First, Li Ying'e complained to Wei Zijian, and then they shouted "beat him," and tied up Wei Zijian and hung him up to beat him. Farmers' Association Chairman Zhang Fude said, "Whoever protects Wei Zijian will be beaten to death." Then he beat Wei Zijian to death mercilessly. Later, after Wei Zijian's wife appealed, the district sent cadres to investigate in detail, and the truth was exposed. The main culprits, Bai Qingzhen, Chen Maobai, Chen Dianqing, and five others have been detained, ready to avenge Wei Zijian.
　　[Our newspaper, Taiyue, 27th dispatch] Quwo Nanlinjiao Village Smashes Chiang Kai-shek Special Agents' Conspiracy to Frame Cadres. This village is the most complex in the entire county, close to Jiang County, at the intersection of three counties where special agent armed forces have long been entrenched. Last year, after the mass movement, it was reoccupied by Chiang's troops, and it was the village where the reckoning was most severe. After the liberation of Quwo City, Chiang Kai-shek's special agents took advantage of our lenient policies, put on the false masks of middle peasants, infiltrated the Farmers' Association, seized control of the village government, and took advantage of the gap in the replacement of our cadres to frame village head Zhang Yuzhi. Zhang Yuzhi had followed the army in hard fighting against the enemy for nearly a year after our army withdrew from Quwo. This time he returned to the village to resume work. Comrade Zhang Yuzhi has some shortcomings, showing pride and insufficient respect for the masses, which caused some dissatisfaction among the masses. Chiang Kai-shek's special agents seized this opportunity. They also deceived a dispatcher from the county government and conspired with him to falsely accuse Zhang Yuzhi of being a new local tyrant. At that time, the new cadres of the village were being replaced and did not understand the situation. Chiang Kai-shek's special agents convened a mass meeting, attempting to overthrow Zhang Yuzhi with lightning speed. However, the cadres discovered it in time, and after discussing it with activists, they collected materials from the masses and convened another mass meeting, exposing the conspiracy of Chiang Kai-shek's special agents, exposing on the spot eight Chiang Kai-shek special agents, including Zhang Yuying, and unanimously demanded that they be handed over to the government for severe punishment.

　　警惕地主阴谋！
  　浮山县府破获地主谋杀案
    【本报太岳二十七日电】浮山中村地主设计打死农会干部。中村在去年群运中，由于划分阶级的错误，致使不少地主混入农会。如地主柏青镇竟混当了农会主席，陈茂柏当了武委会指导员，陈殿卿当了闾长。他们把持村政，包庇地主，形式上已斗争分地，实际上群众根本未发动起来。去年九月，蒋军重陷浮山城，柏青镇等便与敌人勾结，充当情报员。十二月间，我军某部在该地准备伏击敌人，柏青镇即派其“狗腿”柏青林向城内敌人报告。陈殿卿当了伪连长，陈茂柏当了伪书记。今年五月，我军再度收复浮山县城，该村土地改革又复展开，但阶级仍未划清，陈茂柏等继续在农会工作，自称“将功折罪”。积极分子卫子俭，系基本群众，不断揭破柏青镇等包庇地主阴谋，领导群众斗争，成为农会干部，也成了柏青镇等眼中钉，时时要设计谋害他，到处诬蔑卫子俭偷过人的大麻与羊子。柏青镇原与李英娥通奸，六月二十五日，卫子俭带领群众去捉奸，柏青镇便嗾使李英娥反咬卫子俭，说他以手榴弹威胁强奸她，到群众面前去诉苦，以便乘机将他打死，柏青镇并无耻的叫李英娥准备一条撕破的裤子，作为证据。六月二十九日，柏青镇召开首次反动会议，布置了每个人的任务。本月二日，第二次集会中，柏青镇、陈茂柏向其所有同谋者威胁了一顿，订立了纪律，便趁群众开会时，冲入会场。首先是李英娥向卫子俭诉苦，接着他们大声喊“打”，便将卫子俭捆起吊打。农会主席张福德说：“谁包庇卫子俭就打死谁。”便狠命的把卫子俭打死。后经卫子俭之妻上诉，区上派干部详细调查，真相暴露，已将主犯柏青镇、陈茂柏、陈殿卿等五人扣押，准备为卫子俭报仇。
    【本报太岳二十七日电】曲沃南林交村，粉碎蒋特陷害干部阴谋。该村是全县环境最复杂的村子，接近绛县，在素为特务武装盘踞之三县交界处。去年经过群众运动后，被蒋军重陷，为被倒算最严重的村子。曲沃城解放后，蒋特钻我们宽大政策的空子，戴上中农的假面具，混入农会，掌握了村政权，乘我干部调换空隙，陷害村长张毓芝。按张毓芝在我军撤出曲沃后，曾随军艰苦对敌斗争，将近一年。此次重回村里，恢复工作。张毓芝同志有些缺点，表现骄傲与尊重群众不够，所以引起群众一些不满。蒋特便抓这空子。又欺骗一位县政府的收发员，与其同谋，诬蔑张毓芝为新恶霸。当时该村新干部正在调换，不了解情况，蒋特便召开群众大会，企图以迅雷之势，将张毓芝打垮。但被干部及时发觉，与积极分子讨论后，从群众中搜集材料，又召开群众大会，揭破了蒋特阴谋，当场暴露出蒋特张毓英等八人，一致要求送交政府，予以重惩。
