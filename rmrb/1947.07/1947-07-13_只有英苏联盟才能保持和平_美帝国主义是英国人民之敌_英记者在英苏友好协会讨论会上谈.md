Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: London dispatch: The Anglo-Soviet Friendship Association recently held a gathering to discuss the topic proposed by the association, "To be an enemy of the Soviet Union is to be an enemy of Britain." More than 4,000 people attended. The journalist Sloan, in his speech, mentioned the recent Paris Foreign Ministers Conference, stating: The Soviet delegation strived to defend the sovereignty and independence of European countries, but was described by Conservative newspapers as refusing international cooperation. Referring to the countless notes of attack by the British and American foreign ministries against Hungary and other Eastern European countries, Sloan stated: The United States is currently manipulating British foreign policy, which is unfortunate, but it is an ironclad fact. Superficially, we might hope that the British Foreign Secretary, who was once a leader of the Trade Union Congress, would protest to the United States against American anti-labor laws, but he does not want to do so. Sloan concluded by strongly asserting: American monopoly imperialists are the real enemies of the British people and the enemies of peace. Ashley, who worked in the Soviet Union for three years as a journalist, and a local bishop both emphasized at the meeting that only a lasting Anglo-Soviet alliance can maintain peace. The chairman of the association, Evans, said in his final speech: Currently, the enemies of the Soviet Union in Britain want to once again undermine the British people's trust in the Soviet Union. Evans cited as an example the anti-Soviet pamphlets recently distributed by the Catholic Church in London, and after briefly analyzing them, he denounced the pamphlets as base and filthy fabrications against the great Soviet people and their country, which won enthusiastic applause from the audience.

    美帝国主义是英国人民之敌
    英记者在英苏友好协会讨论会上谈
    【新华社陕北八日电】伦敦讯：英苏友好协会日前举行集会，讨论协会所提“与苏为敌即与英为敌”的题目，与会者达四千余人。记者斯罗恩于发言中提及最近巴黎三外长会议称：苏联代表团力求保卫欧洲各国的主权与独立，但却被保守党报纸说成拒绝国际合作。提到英美外交部对匈牙利及其他东欧国家的举不胜举的攻击照会时，斯罗恩称：美国目前是操纵着英国的外交政策，这是个不幸，然却是铁的事实。从表面看，我们也许可以希望这位曾经是联工会领袖的英国外长，向美国抗议美国的反劳工法，然而他并不想这样作。斯罗恩结语力称：美国垄断帝国主义者才是英国人民的真正敌人与和平的敌人。曾以记者资格在苏工作三年的艾胥利及当地主教在会上都强调，只有英苏经久的联盟才能保持和平。协会主席依凡士最后发言，他说：目前在英国的苏联之敌，又想再次破坏英国人民对苏联的信任。依凡士举出最近伦敦天主教会散发的反苏小册子为例，略加分析后，痛斥该小册子为反对伟大苏维埃人民及其国家的卑鄙龌龊的虚构；博得了全场听众的热烈掌声。
