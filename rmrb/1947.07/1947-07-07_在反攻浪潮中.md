　　In the Counter-Offensive Tide
　　(Fragments from the Heroic Gathering Before the Nenjiang Offensive)
    Hu Qi, Zeng Ke

　　I. “With you, we fear nothing.”
　　In the weapons exhibition hall, everyone scrambled to see the various mountain guns, twin-barreled machine guns, anti-tank guns, etc., that they had captured themselves, all saying in unison:
　　“We lack nothing in weapons now, this is our actual strength for the counter-offensive.”
　　A base area soldier, seeing the heavy mortars made in the Taihang Mountains, immediately hugged the thick bore, and kissed it with his face, saying:
　　“Oh, my dear mother! With you, I fear nothing!”

　　II. Forward! People's Liberation Army of China.
　　The leader brought everyone good news. He told everyone to rest early and prepare to get up early tomorrow morning for a Party member meeting. Non-Party heroes were overjoyed to hear that they were also welcome to attend the meeting, and immediately went to sleep quietly.

　　The windows were just beginning to whiten when the assembly call sounded. The teams of each unit assembled more quickly, lined up more neatly, and marched more spiritedly than ever before. It was as if they were going to complete a combat mission with a sure grasp of victory, and not a single non-Party hero gave up this glorious right.

　　The Party anthem was solemnly sung in the clear morning air. Slogans and vows responding to the Party's various calls resonated like steel, and the emotionally charged report of Director Yan of the Party Committee was imprinted in the hearts of the heroes word by word.

　　The meeting adjourned. Party members shouldered the glorious task of leading the masses to make more contributions to the people in the great counter-offensive, and walked out of the meeting place happily. Non-Party heroes were also excited and talked about their feelings and resolutions. Liberation soldier Guo Shunde said:

　　"No wonder Party comrades are more advanced than us in recognizing all problems, they often hear these good principles. This time, we became heroes, and the superiors asked us to participate in the Party member meeting, which is really looking up to us!"

　　"Last night, when I heard that we were also called to participate in this meeting, I couldn't sleep." Another liberation soldier, Wen Bocheng, continued: "I worked as a nurse in the Central Army for ten years, and others were promoted, but I didn't have a personal relationship with the officials, so it wasn't my turn. I was able to become a hero in a few days after arriving in the Eighth Route Army. Riding a tall horse, wearing a red flower, gongs and drums sending me off, my name was inscribed on the golden list, and the instructor wrapped the citation with red silk and kept it, the glory is indescribable, and they treat us as Party members. I must compete with Party members in the counter-offensive and make more contributions."

　　Li Hongkui said in a repentant voice:
　　"I used to be a puppet soldier, and I raped women, I really dare not even think about it now. The chief specifically told us: the masses are our parents, and we must rely on them in the counter-offensive, and I must treat the people like a Communist Party member."

　　A model worker also joined the conversation and said:
　　"Every Communist Party member wants to be a hero, and everyone strives to become a Party member, both are glorious. Party members, heroes, and models, leading the masses to work together, can thoroughly liberate all the people of China."

　　Hearing this, everyone looked at the "People's Liberation Army of China" armband newly worn on their left arm, and smiled in unison. This armband is a symbol of victory and glory! People were smiling and couldn't close their mouths. The unspoken words seemed to be:
　　"Forward! People's Liberation Army of China."

　　III. Return to my hometown to report merits to my father
　　The leaders of each unit, while leading the heroes to visit the exhibition hall and helping them hold discussion meetings, also rushed to write merit report happy lists day and night.

　　The heroes whose families were in the liberated areas jumped up with joy when they heard about this, and everyone guessed that a glorious plaque would be hung in their home.

　　Some heroes whose families were not in the liberated areas felt uncomfortable when they heard that they would not be given a merit report, and Zhang Yurong was the most impatient. He immediately ran to the leader and clung to him, saying, "No, we must each be given one, the great counter-offensive is coming, and if we are given one, we can carry it with us, and when we fight to my home, we can report the merits to our parents."

　　After discussing the matter, the eight leaders immediately gave them a satisfactory answer, saying that their request was very legitimate and decided to issue them.

　　A day later, when Zhang Yurong and that large group of heroes received the brand new, shiny, yellow-bottomed, red-lettered merit report, everyone looked at it with a smile, as if they had obtained a priceless treasure, and didn't know where to put it.

　　Later, Zhang Yurong ran to the leader and requested: "Captain, the merit report is easy to crush if it is placed by your side, you should keep it for us, and when we fight to my home, you must remember to give it to us!"

　　IV. Heroes Congratulate Heroes, Everyone Congratulates the Counter-Offensive
　　Two special-class heroes, Shi Yulun and Li Zhiwu, met.

　　The two shook hands tightly, as if they were old friends, you looked at me, I looked at you, not knowing how to express their affection. After a while, Shi Yulun took out two cigarettes from his pocket, and Li Zhiwu just lit the fire, and the two of them smoked lovingly.

　　Shi Yulun blushed and slowly opened his mouth first: "Comrade Zhiwu, I really admire your bravery and determination. After hearing your speech that day, the people in my class shouted all night and couldn't sleep, and everyone was determined to learn from you."

　　Hearing these words, Li Zhiwu fidgeted on the chair and flicked the cigarette ash, also blushing and smiling at Shi Yulun and said: "Comrade, individual heroism does not play a big role, yesterday I visited your exhibition room, and I felt that your whole class has a good collective spirit, in the future I will definitely learn from you to understand the soldiers' minds and consolidate the troops well, in exchange for small price to get big victory!"

　　In this way, the two heroes talked for nearly half an hour, and when each returned to his own dormitory, they immediately started to formulate their recent combat and work plans based on the content of this conversation.

　　Of course, in addition to these two special-class heroes humbly learning from each other, almost every hero who participated in the conference had his own object of study.

　　Zhang Pengfei, a hero of the Yangzhuang battle, felt that his mass discipline was poor, and he voluntarily proposed to learn from the good spirit of a certain Wang Dongfa company that always considered the people.

　　When the little hygienist Hu Yutian saw the comic strip of model worker Li Liansheng, he quickly calculated to treat the scabies in his unit as well. Later, when he heard the touching story that Li Liansheng had not returned home for eight years during the Anti-Japanese War, and had only stayed for an hour and a half before returning to the team, Hu Yutian innocently said with a smile: "Okay, when the great counter-offensive hits my doorstep, I won't go home, to do revolution, I must do it to the end like him!"

　　He Zhiming, a hero from the liberated area, stared at Li Zhiwu's photo hanging on the green wall after seeing Li Zhiwu's glorious deeds in the exhibition room: "You are really a good comrade, you are not from the liberated area, but in order to defend the Taihang Mountains and our hometown, you were wounded three times without leaving the front line; after the great counter-offensive, when I go to liberate your hometown, I will insist on fighting Lao Jiang even if I am wounded five times!"

　　在反攻浪潮中
    （嫩江部反攻前群英大会片断）
    胡奇　曾克
  　一、“有了你，咱啥也不怕。”
    在武器展览馆里，大家争看自己亲手缴来的各种山炮、双筒机枪、反坦克炮等，都异口同声的说：
    “咱们现在啥武器也不缺啦，这就是我们反攻的实际力量。”
    一个根据地的战士，看见了太行山上自做的重迫击炮，一下抱住那粗口径，用脸亲着他说：
    “好我的亲娘呀！有了你，俺啥也不怕啦！”
    二、前进吧！中国人民的解放军。
    带队人给大家送来了一个好消息。他让大家早点休息，准备明天一早起来开党员大会。非党的英雄们，一听说也欢迎他们参加这个会，简直喜出望外，马上安静的睡下去。
    窗子刚刚发白，集合号就响了。各单位的队伍，比任何一次都集合得迅速，排列得整齐，走得精神。好象要去完成一个确有胜利把握的战斗任务似的，没有一个非党英雄放弃这个光荣的权利。
    党歌在清澈的晨空中严肃的唱起来。响应党的各种号召的口号誓言，钢铁一般震响着，党委会阎主任的充满情感的报告，一字一句都印在英雄的心里。
    散会了。党员们肩起大反攻中带领群众为人民多立功的光荣任务，愉快的走出会场。非党英雄们也都激动得纷纷谈着自己的感想和决心。解放战士郭顺德说：
    “怪不得党员同志啥问题都比咱认识的进步，他们常常听这些好道理。这回，咱们当了英雄，上级叫咱们参加党员会，真是看得起咱们呀！”
    “夜黑，一听说叫咱们也参加这个会，我就咋也睡不着了。”另一个解放战士文伯承接上来说：“我在中央军干了十年看护，别人都升了，我和当官的没私人感情，没我的份。来到八路军没几天，就能当英雄。骑大马挂红花，锣接鼓送，金榜上题着名字，报功单指导员给用红绸子包着保存起来，光荣的就没法说啦，还把咱当党员看待，反攻中咱一定跟党员竞个赛，多立功。”
    李洪奎用忏悔的声音说：
    “过去我当过伪军，奸淫过妇女，现在真是想也不敢想。首长特别对咱说：群众就是咱们的爹娘，反攻中咱们要依靠他们，我一定要象共产党员那样对待老百姓。”
    一位模范工作者也参加大家的谈话说：
    “共产党员个个要当英雄，英雄人人争取做党员，两个都光荣。党员英雄模范，带领着群众一齐干，才能彻底解放全中国的老百姓。”
    听了这个话，大家不约而同的，看着左臂上新佩带起的“中国人民解放军”的臂章，都笑了。这臂章是胜利和光荣的标帜！人们都微笑着，合不拢嘴。没有说出来的话仿佛是：
    “前进吧！中国人民的解放军。”
    三、打回老家去给爹报功
    各单位的带队人，一面领着众英雄参观展览馆，帮助他们开讨论会，一面又连明连夜的赶着写报功喜单。
    家庭在解放区的英雄听到这件事，大家都高兴得跳起来，每个人都猜度着家里一定会挂上光荣匾。
    一些家庭不在解放区的英雄听说不给他们发报功单，心里就不舒展，张玉荣性子最急，他马上跑到带领人那里，紧紧缠着说：“不行，一定得给我们每人也发一张，眼看就大反攻了，发了叫我们带在身边，几时打到我家里，几时就能给爹娘报功。”
    八个带队人商量的结果，立刻就给他们满意答复，说他们这种要求很正当，决定照发。
    隔了一天，当张玉荣和那一大群英雄接到那张新崭崭，油光光，黄底红字的报功单时，大家笑嘻嘻的看着它，象得了无价宝似的，不知道往哪里放是好了。
    后来，还是张玉荣跑到带队人那里请求道：“队长，报功单放在身边容易揉碎，你还是给我们保管好，啥时候打到我家，啥时候你就记住给我们发！”
    四、英雄贺英雄大家贺反攻
    两个特等英雄：史玉伦和李治五会了面。
    两人紧握着手，好象多老朋友似的，你看我，我看你，不知道怎么表示亲热好。停了一会，史玉伦从衣袋里掏出两支烟，李治五刚好也擦亮火，两人就你亲我爱的吸起烟来。
    史玉伦红着脸，慢慢先开了腔：“治五同志，我真佩服你的勇敢，坚决，那天听了你的讲话，我班里人嚷了一夜没睡，大家都下决心要向你学习。”
    李治五听见这番话，在椅子上就坐卧不安的弹了弹烟灰，也红了脸笑看着史玉伦说：“同志，个人英勇起作用还不大，昨天我参观你的展览室，我就觉着你全班人集体精神好，往后我一定学习你摸透战士心思，好好巩固部队，以小的代价换取大的胜利！”
    这样，两个英雄畅谈了将近半个钟头，当各人回到自己宿舍后，他们立刻根据这次谈话内容，就动手订自己最近作战与工作计划了。
    当然，除了这两位特等英雄互相虚心学习外，差不多每个参加大会的英雄，都有自己学习的对象。
    杨庄战斗英雄张鹏飞觉着他群众纪律差，他自动提出学某王东法连队处处为人民打算的好精神。
    小卫生员胡玉田看到模范工作者李连生的连环画时，他连忙盘算着把自己单位的疥号，也好好治一下。后来他又听说李连生抗战八年没回家，回了家只待了一个半钟头就归队的这一段动人的故事时，胡玉田天真的，笑嘻嘻的说：“好，等到大反攻打到我家门口时，我就不回家照，干革命吗，一定象人家那样干到底！”
    解放区的英雄何志明，当他在李治五展览室看完那轰轰烈烈事迹时，他盯着挂在绿墙上李治五的照片说：“真是好同志啊，你不是解放区的人，为了保卫太行山，保卫咱家乡，你负伤三次都不下火线；以后大反攻了，我去解放你家乡时，我负伤五次也坚持着跟老蒋拚！”
