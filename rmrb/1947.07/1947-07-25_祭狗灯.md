　　Offering Sacrifices to the Dog Lamp
    Kou Bin
    The local tyrant landlord Guo Luogong, his face ashen, his whole body trembling, stood blankly in the crowd. From the surging crowd, an emaciated old peasant jumped out, grabbed Luogong, and shouted in a trembling voice, "Guo Luogong! A poor man's life isn't even worth as much as your dog!..." The whole place immediately fell silent, listening to old farmer Li Xiaoshen, with tears streaming down his face, pour out his bitterness:
    "This happened fifteen years ago. In the autumn, I earned a few liters of grain with my blood and sweat. At night, I ground it into flour in the moonlight, intending to eat it for a few days. Your wolf-like big black dog ate all my flour. I was really angry: people bully us, and now your dog bullies poor people too! Relying on the fact that I was a human being, I beat your dog to death. Guo Luogong, you demanded that I pay with my life for the dog, you had me put in jail. Poor people have short tempers; I was afraid of dying. I pleaded with relatives and friends to speak well of me to you. Poor people, us helpless poor people, finally accepted your harsh conditions. I paraded through the streets wearing the big black dog's skin. Guo Luogong! You really scared me silly back then; I didn't even know I was still a human being!" Xiaoshen choked up and couldn't go on. After a pause, he howled again: "In the freezing twelfth month, I had to light a lamp offering sacrifices to your dog. You made me light a lamp every night in a small temple half a mile west of the village! That was burning my blood and oil! A year's wages as a short-term laborer! Even if there was half a foot of snow, I still had to light it. Even if the north wind blew people down, I didn't dare to stop... Guo Luogong, look at what you've done to me!"
    The masses who had turned over at the meeting could no longer contain their anger: "Down with the tyrant Guo Luogong! He made the poor light dog lamps!" Fists rained down on Guo Luogong.

　　祭狗灯
    寇彬
    恶霸地主郭洛工，灰青着脸，全身发着抖，呆立在群众中。从怒潮般的人群里，跳出了一个形容憔悴的老农民，一把扯住洛工，声音颤动着喊：“郭洛工！穷人的命，竟不如你家的狗呀！……”全场的人立刻肃静了，静听老农李小申的老泪横流地诉出他的苦：
    “这是十五年前的事。我在秋季里一滴血一点汗挣来了几升谷子，夜晚我在月亮地里，把它推成面粉，打算吃几天。你那只狼一样的大花狗，竟把我的面子吃了个一干二净。我真恼了：人欺侮咱吧，你狗也来欺侮穷人了！我仗着自己是人，把你的狗打死了。郭洛工，你叫我赔狗命，你叫我住看守所。人穷志短，我怕死，我托亲的、告厚的、给你说好话。穷人，咱这没法子的穷人，终于接受了你苛毒的条件。披着大花狗皮游街。郭洛工！那时你真把我吓迷糊了，我竟不知道我还是个人！”小申哽咽得说不下去了，停了一停，又嚎叫起来：“石冻腊月我给你点祭狗灯。你叫我在村西半里地的一个土地庙里，每天晚上给燃着一盏祭狗的灯！那是燃的我的血油呀！一年短工的工价呀！半尺厚的雪我也去点，北风刮坏人，我也不敢间断……，郭洛工，你看看把我糟踏成啥样！”
    会场里翻身的群众，再也忍不住愤怒的烈火：“打倒恶霸郭洛工，他叫穷人点狗灯”，雨点似的拳头打在郭洛工身上。
