    Tunliu New District Completes Sowing in a Timely Manner; Inspection and Rectification of Mutual Aid Teams
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 13th dispatch] In the vast new district of Tunliu, due to the correct implementation of various policies of organizing, among 146 administrative villages with a population of over 88,000, more than 69% of male full laborers, 57% of semi-laborers, 50% of female full laborers, 49% of semi-laborers, and 68.8% of livestock have been organized. During the spring plowing, more than 494,600 mu of land were sown on time, 5,653 mu of barren land were eliminated, and 27,700 mu of land belonging to 4,421 military dependents were guaranteed to be sown simultaneously. Based on labor power, each full/semi-laborer cultivated an average of 28.9 mu, and each full animal power cultivated an average of 108 mu. In addition to supporting the front lines, manpower and animal power were extremely scarce. However, due to the coercive orders during the organization of mutual aid last year and the failure to truly achieve equivalent exchange, the vast majority of the masses were unwilling to organize. At the beginning of spring plowing this year, the leadership first mobilized cadres and activists in villages with a good working foundation to take the lead in organizing in the villages, with activists as the core, gradually organizing from small to large. For example, in Xu Village, 21 activists took the lead, and within three days, 85% of the village's male full and semi-laborers were organized. In Du Village, the cadres first paid off the mutual aid wages owed from last year, and then organized. In Dongzhuang, the cadres announced that wages must be paid this year due to the losses of unrecorded accounts last year, and the masses re-established mutual aid with the cadres. The women's mutual aid group in Deng Village was expanded by solving the women's family difficulties. Currently, the district is conducting in-depth inspections to further consolidate it.

    屯留新区及时完成下种
    检查整顿互助组
    【本报太岳十三日电】屯留广大新区由于正确的贯彻组织起来的各种政策，在一百四十六个行政村、八万八千多人口中，已组织起男全劳力百分之六十九以上，半劳力百分之五十七，女全劳力百分之五十，半劳力百分之四十九，牲畜百分之六十八点八。在春耕中四十九万四千六百多亩土地，作到按时耕种完毕，并且消灭了熟荒五千六百五十三亩，又保证了四千四百二十一户军属的二万七千七百亩土地同时下种。按劳力情况，每个全半劳力即平均种地二十八亩九分，每个全畜力平均耕地一○八亩。又加支援前线，人畜力是极端困难，但因去年组织互助时的强迫命令，和没有真正作到等价交换，使广大群众不愿组织起来。今年春耕开始，领导上先在工作基础好的村子把干部和积极分子动员起来，分头在村里带头组织，以积极分子为核心，由小到大的慢慢组织。如许村二十一个积极分子带头，三天内全村男全半劳力即组织起百分之八十五。杜村则是干部先把去年欠的互助工资开了，而组织起来的。东庄是去年吃了没记帐的亏，今年干部宣布一定要出工资，群众重新与干部互助起来。邓村妇女互助组，则是由解决妇女的家庭困难而扩大的。目前该区正深入检查，使其进一步巩固起来。
