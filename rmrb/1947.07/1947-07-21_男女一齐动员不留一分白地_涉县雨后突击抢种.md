　　Mobilizing Men and Women Alike, Leaving No Land Unplanted
  　She County Rushes to Plant After Rain
    [Our Newspaper, She County News] On the afternoon of the 13th of this month, after widespread rain in most villages in the 1st, 2nd, 5th, and 9th districts of She County, under the direct leadership of the County Party Committee, cadres from all county-level organs and institutions, with all available labor and livestock, were assigned to various villages to mobilize, organize, and lead the masses in a concentrated effort to plant. Over 70 teachers and students from the Normal School participated in the effort in fifteen villages including Henan Store, Huyu, and Nanzhuang, helping the masses with planting. After a day and a half of effort on the 14th and 15th, over 10,000 mu had been planted in thirteen villages, except for a small amount of land left unplanted for vegetables. After the cadres arrived in the villages, they first went to the mutual aid teams and personally helped those lacking labor to pull the seed drills and harrows. While working, they also discovered and addressed the masses' thoughts. For example, in Huyu Village and Nanbeigangtou and other villages, most of the masses felt that the rain this time was small and did not dare to plant for fear of wasting the seeds, waiting for heavy rain before planting. After understanding and addressing their concerns, Huyu proposed "resolutely leaving no land unplanted," and the entire village mobilized to advance the planting. Yang Suobao from Xigang used his experience of early planting in the previous two years to promote the idea to the masses. Under the active mobilization and organization in various villages, all male and female laborers were fully invested in the planting campaign. During the planting, the masses in Beiyuan Village proposed, "Delay in labor means loss, delay from nature means no harvest." The masses in Nanzhuang Village were discussing the planting at mealtimes, suggesting that, "It is better to scratch your head (meaning planting thickly for guaranteed seedlings) than to slap your bottom (meaning regretting the lack of seedlings)," advocating for more seeds. In terms of labor and livestock allocation, Huyu conducted investigations and research, carefully formulating a plan: one donkey and one seed drill should plant twenty mu per day, first planting for the families of soldiers, and then taking care of the elderly and weak. Henan Store stipulated a wage of two jin of rice for planting one mu of land for households without labor, rationally converting work into payment, and organized cadres to inspect the plots to ensure that no land was left unplanted. Wang Yue'e, a fifteen-year-old girl from Nangang, pulled the seed drill while her younger sister, Wang Ming'e, led the livestock, planting seven mu in half a day, earning praise as a model girl. In leading the planting, attention was paid to discovering model examples, constantly promoting and encouraging enthusiasm, overcoming and correcting shortcomings, and improving technology. For example, in Huyu, during an inspection, it was discovered that Cheng Luoyi was planting too shallowly. He immediately discussed with the masses about planting a little deeper according to the amount of rain, planting below the damp soil, which would both protect the seedlings and prevent them from being exposed to the sun. After this planting effort, each village conducted a summary. Xigang Village also elected male and female models to conduct a mass campaign of evaluation, recording merits, and establishing achievements. (Jinbo, Shuting, Shaoxing)
    [Further News] The Second District Rushes to Replenish and Plant. For example, in Xuanzhong Village, men and women, young and old, went to the fields before dawn, planting 163 mu of millet, beans, and sorghum in one day. Discovering that there were not enough seed drills, labor hero Cheng Benren immediately convened a meeting of group leaders, proposing to have two people and two donkeys go to the fields, starting early, working late, and replacing each other at noon so that the person rests but the drill does not. Yang Fulou and others lent out their millet seeds for everyone to plant, and the production director was responsible for the large-scale seed adjustment between groups and villages. Li Xicheng and others proposed to first plant for the families of soldiers and cadres, and for the elderly and weak, which everyone unanimously agreed to. In one and a half days, the entire village completed planting 220 mu. Shangwen Village proposed: "First plant the ridge land, then plant the ditch land, ensuring that not a single mu of land is left unplanted." They also accurately calculated the village's labor, livestock, and land, specifically assigning tasks so that those who could plant would plant and those who could cultivate would cultivate. Old Man Wang said, "The Eight Immortals cross the sea, each displaying their skills." In two days, the entire village had completed planting. Bai Quanshui had an old man who previously exposed his kiln, but this time he could put it to use, saying: "Following the Communist Party and listening to Chairman Mao is definitely right. It is beneficial whatever the higher-ups ask us to do." Xida and other villages proposed that if less than half of the seedlings came up, they would simply destroy them, plow them again, loosen the soil, make it more drought-resistant, and easier to plant. Currently, most of the district has completed planting, and a few villages are continuing to plant. (Lu Qing)
    [Our Newspaper, Shahe News] On the afternoon of the 14th, most villages in the 3rd and 4th districts of this county experienced a torrential rain, also accompanied by hail. Some of the small millet seedlings were beaten by the hail, leaving only bare stalks that were a little over an inch tall. At that time, the entire county was holding an expanded cadre meeting, and the cadres of the 3rd and 4th districts were immediately sent down to organize the masses to rush to plant and replant. The students of the Nangaoshi Normal Class and the Beizhang Ergao School also all helped to plant in the villages where they were stationed. The county government's livestock were lent to the masses for use. The Bureau of Industry and Commerce sent a special person to Xincheng to organize the labor and livestock resources of the merchants and organs, also investing them in the planting campaign. (Kuilin)
    [Our Newspaper, Wu'an News] The Tenth District and the village key points only received widespread rain on July 13th. The government called for a concentrated effort to complete planting within two or three days. District Chief Chen was concerned about the difficulty of the masses lacking livestock and organized the livestock of various public-owned stores in advance to fully assist the masses with planting. The public-owned hotel alone allocated all of its thirty-odd livestock to various villages, with each livestock planting at least ten mu per day, planting at least 100 mu within three days. The masses happily said: "The government led us to turn ourselves around, we have land to plant, and the public also helps with livestock. If we still don't do a good job in farming, we simply can't say it, we must cultivate deeply and meticulously in the future and produce more grain." (Zhirang)

    【本报武安讯】十区和村基点，于七月十三日才普遍落雨，政府号召在二、三天内突击种完，陈区长关心群众缺乏畜力的困难，事先将各公营商店的牲畜组织起来，全力帮助群众下种，仅公营酒店，即将全部牲畜三十余头分配到各村，每头牲口每天下种以十亩计，三天内最少能下种十顷，群众高兴的说：“政府领导咱翻了身，有地种了，公家又帮助牲口，咱要再不好好务庄稼，简直就说不下去，今后要深耕细作，多打粮食才行。”（智让）
