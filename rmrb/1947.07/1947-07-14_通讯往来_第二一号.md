    Correspondence
    No. 21
    To Comrades Correspondents in Various Regions:
    I. The prelude to the great counter-offensive has begun, and good news is pouring in. The entire region is jubilant, and the counter-offensive campaign to perform meritorious deeds will surely unfold extensively throughout our entire region. Comrades in factories, government offices, county districts, and village cadres, please immediately report on how you are intensifying production and practicing economy, the enthusiasm to support the counter-offensive, heroic deeds, new experiences in organizing in the newly liberated areas, and experiences in rectifying mutual aid in the old liberated areas. When writing, pay attention to the development process of the work, grasp one problem and write clearly and in detail, do not write about everything.
    II. August 1st is approaching. Please report on our army's self-defense war achievements, political work construction, officer-soldier relations, military-civilian relations, and various heroic model deeds over the past year. Show the growth and strengthening of the Party's army, how it has changed from weak to strong, from small to large, into an invincible force in combat. Please also seize the opportunity to report on the preferential treatment of military families in the rear, the model deeds of military dependents and retired soldiers; also promptly reflect on the organization and preparation of the "August 1st" Movement Week and other activities.
    III. In the future, our liberated areas will expand day by day. Please seize the new spirit of boldly mobilizing the masses in the newly liberated areas, discover typical examples, and write them into news reports to send to us.
