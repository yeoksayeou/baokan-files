    Employees of Military Factory No. 1 Strive for Early Victory
    Continue to Deepen Emulation Drive, Conserve Resources, Increase Production, and Support the Counter-Offensive
    [Our Dispatch] All employees of the foundry department of Military Factory No. 1, after ideological remolding and study, recognize the current favorable situation, resolutely implement the instructions of higher authorities to increase production and conserve resources, overcome the difficulties before victory, continue to deepen the emulation drive to support the front-line counter-offensive, and strive to defeat Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible. All employees of Team Four held a meeting, voluntarily proposing to reduce costs and increase piecework production standards. Currently, the furnace team's artillery shell production has increased by 116% per month, and all miscellaneous workers refuse wages. The three sand casting teams have increased production by 57% per month. These are astonishing achievements in conservation and increased production. The factory's Emulation Committee has issued a circular to all units to commend them. (Lü Yan)
    [Our Dispatch] After studying current events since July 1st, the employees of the Liushenggou Coal Mine further understood that the Communist Party is the political party of the working class, their own party, and that the factory is the property of the revolution, their own property. Under the slogan of commemorating "July 1st" with practical actions to support the counter-offensive, a surge in production movement has been launched. Mine No. 1 has already been dug to 20 zhang and 1.6 chi. It is estimated that after removing the ten-odd chi of sand cover, large coal seams will be reached, at a rate of five cun per day. Mine No. 2 has already been dug to 14 zhang and 6.2 chi. Based on the experience of Mine No. 1, small coal seams will be encountered after digging another 1.6 zhang. According to this calculation, both mines will simultaneously encounter coal within 20 days—the "Double Happiness at the Door" movement has greatly heightened everyone's spirits. The comrades of the security team proposed to match the efficiency of stonemasons in well digging. When stonemason workers come to change shifts, they put on raincoats and wait at the wellhead before the scheduled time. When stonemasons change shifts, they also bring two chunks of stone with them, saying, "If I could bring more, I would." The comrades pushing carts proposed to ensure uninterrupted work underground, regardless of rising water levels, without adding personnel. The comrades of the mechanical department guaranteed that the machines would have few or no problems. The hooking comrades guaranteed safety. The general affairs department ensured sufficient materials. Currently, production efficiency has increased unprecedentedly, with output increasing by 112%. Mine No. 2 increased by 60%. The team pushing carts usually pushed 130 bags of water per shift (eight hours). Comrade Zhang Quangui, leading the tenth security team, proposed to push no less than 200 bags due to the rising water level. As a result, they pushed 201 bags, an increase of 54.6%. Generally speaking, after the launch of the shock movement, production efficiency has increased by an average of 55.5%. The movement is currently vigorously underway. (Li Zhongliang, Han Guojun)
    [Our Dispatch from Southern Hebei, 18th] Oil factory workers reduce wages and increase production to support the counter-offensive. The Industrial Section of the Administrative Office's Finance and Economics Office recently convened a meeting of managers and workers from oil factories in Nangong, Wucheng, and Matou Li to discuss how to support the counter-offensive. The workers said: "To support the great counter-offensive, we will take less salary from the government and produce more for the government!" A competition to reduce wages and increase production has been launched in each factory. The wage reduction by workers in Wucheng influenced workers in Nangong, who also proposed reducing their monthly compensation from 200 jin of rice to 150 jin. Workers in Matou Li earning 360 jin of rice per month reduced it to 270 jin, and those earning 240 jin reduced it to 180 jin. In terms of increasing output and quality, workers in Wucheng proposed reducing one person and still producing 2,000 jin more oil per day, while guaranteeing pure cake quality, bright and lustrous oil, and delicious taste when eaten and bright light when used for lamps. Workers in Nangong also proposed not reducing two people while maintaining the same quality. Workers in Matou Li are willing to compare the quality of their oil cake with that of Wucheng, but want to process 3,000 jin more seeds per day, while guaranteeing savings in raw materials and care for tools.
