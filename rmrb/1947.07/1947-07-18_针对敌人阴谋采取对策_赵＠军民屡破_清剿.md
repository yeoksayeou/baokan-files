Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 15th -- An introduction to the anti-"Encirclement and Suppression" experience of Zhao＠ County (newly established county, located in the northern part of Pi County) in Southern Shandong: When Chiang's army "encircled and suppressed" the county, they adopted the following methods: (1) Rotating night encirclements, controlling mountain tops and road junctions, launching attacks at dawn. (2) Repeated surprise attacks and encirclements: Once the enemy discovered our target, they would concentrate the forces of several strongholds and act simultaneously on all routes to carry out daytime encirclements, or adopt long-distance surprise attacks of dozens of miles. During these surprise attacks, they also often used the method of "fake withdrawal, real attack." (3) Using larger forces divided into several routes to encircle an area, controlling mountain tops, and then dispersing into many small groups for close searches; or setting up temporary strongholds to implement "stationed suppression." (4) In terms of using troops, they adopted "wheel tactics," such as stationing three companies in a stronghold, taking turns going out and taking turns resting. (5) Avoiding the main force, specifically attacking regions. If the enemy discovered our main force, they would quickly retreat; if they discovered local armed forces or militia, they would launch continuous assaults. (6) Simultaneously promoting political conspiracies. Every time they arrived at a village, they would convene a "villagers' meeting" and force the establishment of a puppet regime. One type was to establish armed Bao Gongsuo and village offices, staying in the village during the day and transferring at night; another was to force our military dependents, workers, and martyrs' families to work for them, to prevent our destruction. In addition, they used cruel massacres to suppress the people's resistance activities, or spread rumors to shake the people's morale. After the local army and people saw through their tricks, they adopted various effective countermeasures: (1) Militarily, they adopted active offensive tactics, sending out small armed groups to approach strongholds and monitor the enemy. As soon as the enemy moved out, they would set up ambushes to break the enemy's encirclement plan. In addition, sharpshooters formed strong teams to approach highway strongholds. If the enemy sent out large forces, they would use sniping to block and harass them; if the enemy did not move out, they would capture the enemy's scattered personnel who went out, so that the enemy's small groups would not dare to leave the strongholds far. A large number of landmines were laid on important mountain tops and transportation lines in the enemy-occupied areas. (2) When the enemy "encircled and suppressed," capable armed forces were left behind to disperse and persist, suppress bad elements taking the opportunity to raise their heads, strike at small groups of "Return Home Corps," destroy Chiang's measures, and maintain contact with the masses. The anti-Chiang transformation struggle is the key to persisting in the struggle. First, resolutely suppress the treacherous despots and landlords who colluded with the enemy and were hated by the public. At the same time, hold symposiums for the small and medium landlords who have been liquidated, conduct current affairs education, and strive for neutrality. Resolutely strike at the established Chiang's regime to prevent it from gaining a foothold. For the military and worker families who were forced to work by the enemy, mobilize them to transfer and provide them with care. Due to the adoption of the above methods, Chiang's army's multiple "encirclement and suppression" ended in failure, and to this day, none of the four districts of the county, namely the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh districts, have a Chiang regime.

    针对敌人阴谋采取对策
    赵＠军民屡破“清剿”
    【新华社山东十五日电】鲁南赵＠（新设县，在邳县北部）县反“清剿”经验介绍：蒋军“清剿”该县时，采取下列方式：（一）轮番的夜间包围，控制山头路口，拂晓实行攻击。（二）反复奔袭合围：敌发现我之目标后，即集中几个据点兵力，各路同时行动，实行白天包围，或采取数十里长途奔袭。在奔袭中，也常用“假撤实攻”办法。（三）以较大兵力分成数路，包围一个地区，控制山头后，即分散很多小股紧密搜索；或安设临时据点，实行“驻剿”。（四）在使用兵力上，采取“车轮战术”，如一个据点内驻上三个连，轮流出动，轮流休息。（五）避开主力，专攻地区，敌发现我主力后，即迅速撤退，发现地方武装、民兵则连续突击。（六）同时推行政治阴谋，每到一村，即召开“村民会”，强迫建立伪政权。一种是建立武装保公所、村公所，白天住村，晚上转移；另一种是强迫我军、工、烈属为其工作，以防我之摧毁。此外并以残酷屠杀，镇压群众反抗活动，或散布谣言，动摇群众情绪。当地军民洞烛其奸后，采取了各种有效的对策：（一）军事上采取积极进攻战术，派出小股武装逼近据点，监视敌人，敌一出动，即打埋伏，使敌合围计划破产。并由特等射手组成坚强小组，逼近公路据点，敌大股出动，则以冷枪阻击袭扰，敌不出动，则捕捉敌之零星外出人员，使敌小股不敢远离据点。在敌占区重要山头与交通线上，大量埋设地雷。（二）敌“清剿”时，留下精干武装分散坚持，镇压坏蛋乘机抬头，打击“还乡团”小股活动，破坏蒋化措施，保持与群众联系。反蒋化斗争，是坚持斗争的关键。首先对勾结敌人为众痛恨的奸霸、地主，坚决镇压，同时对被清算的中小地主，举行座谈会，进行时事教育，争取中立。对已建立的蒋政权，坚决打击，使其不能立足。对被敌强迫工作的军、工属，则动员其转移，并予以照顾。由于采取上述办法，使蒋军多次“清剿”归于失败，全县四、五、六、七四个区迄今无一蒋记政权。
