　　Hunger and Anti-Hunger
    ★ During the "June 2nd" Kunming student parade, the walls outside the banks on Nanping Street were covered with large slogans written in ink. The next day, the Central Bank used several gallons of gasoline to wash them away, but although the ink was gone, the writing was still visible. On the cement road of Zheng Yi Road, there was a slogan "Oppose Unification by Force," with characters over five feet in size, which was very eye-catching.
    ★ When the parading students reached Nanping Street, an old beggar was lying on the road. The propaganda team immediately stepped forward and wrote the four large characters "Hunger! Hunger!" next to the old man. The old man nodded sadly, seemingly expressing his gratitude, and the onlookers also sighed with emotion.
    ★ Before the student parade, the Chiang-controlled Yunnan Provincial Government ordered the Yunnan University authorities to dissuade students from parading, otherwise the school authorities would be held responsible. The school authorities then locked the school gate tightly on the morning of the 2nd. Later, after the students explained the purpose of the parade to the school police, and after a majority of the students declared that they would bear all responsibility, the school gate was opened. Students from various schools who had gathered outside were then able to enter and hold a meeting, and after the meeting, they held a joint parade of various schools.

　　饥饿与反饥饿
    ★“六、二”昆明学生游行时，南屏街各银行门口墙上均有以油墨涂写之巨幅标语口号，次日中央银行用了数加仑汽油始洗去，但油墨虽去，字迹尚可看见。正义路水泥路上书有“反对武力统一”标语，字大五尺余，极引人注目。
    ★游行学生行抵南屏街时，路上倒卧一老乞丐，宣传队即上前在老者身旁书写“饥饿！饥饿！”四个大字。老者戚然点首，似表感激之意，旁观者亦唏嘘不已。
    ★蒋记滇省府于学生游行前曾令云南大学当局，令劝阻学生游行，否则由学校当局负责。该校当局遂于二日晨将校门紧锁。后经学生向校警说明游行目的，并由多数学生声明：一切责任由同学自负，校门始启，群集校外之各校学生，乃得入内集会，并于会后举行各校联合大游行。
