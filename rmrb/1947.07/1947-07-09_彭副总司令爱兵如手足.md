　　Deputy Commander Peng Loves Soldiers Like Brothers
　　One, Caring for the Wounded
　　One afternoon after the Yangmahe battle, two wounded soldiers carrying guns arrived at the entrance of the headquarters. Many people were sitting at the entrance, wiping their guns, and Deputy Commander Peng was taking a walk in the courtyard. The two wounded soldiers slowly sat down and asked the gun wipers, "Is this the headquarters of the commander-in-chief?" So Deputy Commander Peng stopped to listen. "We two were scattered by the enemy. One of his eyes was blinded, and my left leg was injured." Everyone around noticed the blood-stained bandages on their bodies. "The stretcher team refused to carry us, saying we were Chiang Hu troops. We walked back for three days." They spoke calmly. Deputy Commander Peng could no longer bear it. He criticized the soldiers he loved so dearly, saying, "Then why did you bring the guns back?" "We are not dead yet!" The answer was just as calm and firm. Deputy Commander Peng, who was usually extremely calm, became excited. He said loudly to the people around him, "Why don't you hurry up and entertain them? Such soldiers have returned, blinded and crippled for the cause of the people without complaint, quietly sitting here. Can we do this? Can we be so loyal to the people?" Saying that, he personally brought boiled water, ordered food to be made, and notified the health authorities. He himself walked over and sat beside the two wounded soldiers, asking about their injuries and combat situation, like long-lost brothers.
　　Two, Learning from the Masses
　　On the top of a mountain 1,500 meters above sea level, a solitary small temple became a temporary forward command post. Deputy Commander Peng put down the telephone receiver and walked outside. Outside the trench, a guard was standing with an old man in his sixties or seventies. The guard reported, "Found a local villager." Deputy Commander Peng's face, which seemed even more serious due to excessive thinking, immediately brightened up. He walked over and asked, "Where are you from, old fellow?" Many people stared at the old man, who was wearing a sheepskin coat, with snow-white hair and silver-like long whiskers fluttering in the mountain wind. He smiled and said, "I came from Yan'an." Deputy Commander Peng smiled, "Today we are fighting, and we asked you to come up for no other reason than to help us listen to how far away the gunfire is and in what direction." Deputy Commander Peng pointed to the front with his hand and said kindly, "Don't go down today, stay with us, eat with us." The old man looked at the tattered shoes on Deputy Commander Peng's feet and naturally walked close to him to the outer edge of the trench, tilted his head, and quietly listened to the faint and sparse gunfire. He told Deputy Commander Peng the experience he had accumulated over decades in distinguishing gunfire, and explained the direction of the gunfire and how far away it was from here. So, Deputy Commander Peng immediately conveyed the order by telephone. A people's ever-victorious general leading a million soldiers learns from the masses at all times, and the masses also know to help him at all times.

### 彭副总司令爱兵如手足

　　彭副总司令爱兵如手足
  　一、爱护伤员
    羊马河战斗以后的一个下午，两个带了枪的伤兵到了司令部门口。门口坐着许多擦枪的人，彭副总司令在院子里散步。两个伤兵慢慢的坐下来，问擦枪的人说：“你们那里是总司令部吗？”于是彭副总司令站下来倾听着。“我们两个人被敌人打散，他的一个眼被打瞎了，我的左腿受了伤。”周围的人都注意着他们两个人身上血迹斑斑的纱布，“担架队不肯抬我们，说我们是蒋胡军，我们是自己熬了三天走回来的。”他们说话时候神气很平静。彭副总司令这时再耐不住了，对于他心爱的战士痛惜的责难起来了，他说：“那你们为什么还把枪拿回来呢？”“我们还没有死呀！”回答得一样平静而坚定。彭副总司令这个平日极其沉静的人，这时激动起来了，他对旁边的人大声说：“你们为什么不赶紧招待他们呢？这样的战士回来了，为人民事业眼瞎了，腿坏了毫无怨言，悄悄的坐在这里，我们能做到这样吗？对人民能这样忠心耿耿吗？说着就亲自拿来了开水，吩咐做饭，通知了卫生机关，他自己走来坐在两个伤兵身旁，询问他们的伤势和作战情形，好象久别重逢的亲兄弟一般。
    二、向群众学习
    在拔海一千五百公尺的山顶上，一座孤立的小庙，成了临时前敌指挥所。彭副总司令把电话筒放下，走到外面来。外面战壕边，一个警卫员带了一个六、七十岁的老人站在那里。警卫员报告说：“找了一个本地老乡。”彭副总司令由于思索过度而显得更加严肃的脸，马上开朗起来了，他走过去问道：“老乡是那里的？”许多人都凝视着这个老人，他身上披一件羊皮袄，白雪般的头发，和银丝般的长须在山顶的狂风中飘拂着，他笑着说：“我是从延安来的。”彭副总司令笑了：“今天我们打仗，把你请上来没别事，就是帮我们听个枪声离我们多远，在那个方向。”彭副总司令用手一边指着前方，一边亲切地说：“今天你不要下去了，跟我们一块睡，一块吃饭。”这个老人看着彭副总司令脚上那烂得开了花的皮鞋，自然的挨着他走到战壕的外围，侧头静静的听着那轻微的稀疏的枪声，他把积累数十年辨别枪声的经验告诉了彭副总司令，并说明了那枪声在那一个方向，离这里多远。于是，彭副总司令，马上用电话传达命令了。一个领导百万雄兵的人民常胜将军，任何时候都向群众学习，而群众也懂得任何时候去帮助他。
