    Wallace Advocates
    Joint Reconstruction of Europe with the Soviet Union
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 11th: New York dispatch: Wallace recently wrote in the New Republic magazine, which he edits, suggesting that the United States Congress should clearly declare that the Marshall Aid Plan should: First, apply to all members of the United Nations; Second, be used for what is necessary to increase production and high standards of living; Third, not involve the United States' interference in the internal affairs of other countries. Wallace also stated: We must work together with the Soviet Union to rebuild Europe.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 14th: TASS, Vienna dispatch: At the Allied Council for Austria meeting on July 11th, the Soviet High Commissioner for Austria, Lieutenant General Kurasov, issued a statement regarding the Anglo-Austrian agreement signed on June 25th, accusing the agreement of affecting the interests of other Allied nations responsible for the recovery of Austrian independence and violating the Allied execution agreement in the Austrian control structure. Kurasov pointed out: The American-Austrian agreement is in fact the United States using Austria's economic difficulties to exert unlimited control and regulation over Austria's entire economic life. Kurasov also sent a letter to the Austrian government, not recognizing the validity of the American-Austrian agreement, and declaring that the Soviet Union is not bound by any of the agreement's provisions.

    华莱士主张
    与苏共同重建欧洲
    【新华社陕北十一日电】纽约讯：华莱士顷在其所主编之新共和杂志上撰文，建议美国会明白宣布马歇尔之援助计划，应当：第一、适用于所有联合国；第二、乃用于增加生产及高度生活标准所必需者；第三、不涉及美国之干涉他国内政。华氏并称：我们必须和苏联共同努力来重建欧洲。
    【新华社陕北十四日电】塔斯社维也纳讯：在七月十一日奥境盟国管委会会议上，苏联驻奥高级专员库拉索夫准上将对六月二十五日签订之英奥协定发表声明，指责该协定影响其他负责收复奥国独立之盟国利益，而且违反了盟国在奥国管制机构的执行协议。库氏指出：美奥协定事实上美国利用奥国的经济困难，而对奥国整个经济生活无限制的控制与管制。库拉索夫并致函奥国政府，不承认美奥协定为有效，声明苏联不受该协定之任何约束。
