    Early-Maturing Seeds are Mutually Adjusted
    Labor Transformation Promotes Speed
    Neiqiu County Head Lü Leads by Example, Pulling a Roller While Sick, and Leads the Rush to Plant

    [Reported by this newspaper] After a welcome rain on the 2nd of this month in the first, fifth, and sixth districts of Neiqiu, in order to seize the opportunity to rush planting, the cadres of Beijie convened a meeting of group leaders and above that evening to study the rush planting issue. They aimed to ensure that people and animals were never idle, tools never stopped, and that not a single field suitable for planting was overlooked. It was decided to mobilize all forces to organize a large-scale labor transformation, breaking up the past small-scale mutual aid groups and uniformly adjusting and allocating organization based on each person's specialty and technical skills. People and animals were fixed according to the farming tools, and regardless of plowing or planting, the land was tackled in sections to promote speed. A large-scale mutual aid and rush planting movement was launched. After discussion and approval by the masses that evening, twelve groups were organized. Forty-six children and women who had never participated in production before also voluntarily joined the mutual aid. On the evening of the 2nd, County Head Lü not only organized and called upon every cadre to make contributions to the people in this rush planting, but also personally participated in the rush planting in Beijie, pulling a roller while sick. Under the influence of County Head Lü, Dong Liansheng's 62-year-old mother also joined in pulling the roller. The enthusiasm of every member of the masses for rush planting was extremely high, completing the planting of 422 mu and plowing 51 mu of sloping land in one day. That evening, the activists in the rush planting were evaluated and praised via radio, and the rush planting plan for the next day was set, deciding to complete all the work within three days.
    After the rain, the Xiqiu Village in the first district organized large-scale mutual aid to carry out sweeping rush planting and sowing. Some households said they did not have early-maturing seeds, and Village Head Wang Zhenqing said, "I have some." He immediately took out two dou of small sesame seeds and four dou of early-maturing sorghum seeds that were not afraid of fog damage and immediately allocated them to households lacking seeds, which prompted other households to also take out a lot of seeds. Before long, the seed shortage was resolved. Finally, a plan was made: within three days, all 6,152 mu of unplanted dry land in the village, except for a portion reserved for vegetable gardens, would be rush-planted. All labor was organized, and on the second day, they went to the fields before dawn. (Neiqiu Dazhong Xiaobao [Neiqiu Mass Small Newspaper])
