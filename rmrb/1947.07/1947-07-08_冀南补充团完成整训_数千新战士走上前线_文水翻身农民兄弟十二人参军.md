　　Jinnan Supplementary Regiment Completes Training
  　Thousands of New Soldiers Go to the Front Lines
    Twelve Turned-Over Peasant Brothers from Wenshui Enlist in the Army
    [Report from our newspaper in Jinnan, 6th] After training, the new recruit supplementary regiment of the 7th sub-district of Jinnan held automatic challenge competitions from bottom to top, and successively wrote petitions to superiors, requesting to go to the front line to participate in the great counter-offensive and make contributions to the people. A grand rally was held a few days ago to send off thousands of supplementary regiment members to the front lines. The Yangko team and painted boats of the Wuxun Normal School, the attached elementary school, and the masses in the garrison area shook the entire village. At the meeting, the soldiers resolutely put forward guarantees such as: "We will never return until we eliminate the traitor Chiang Kai-shek in the great counter-offensive." A comrade from the first platoon of the third company said: "In the grievance telling during the training, we recognized that the suffering we suffered in the past was all given to us by Chiang Kai-shek, this oppressive demon. We are now willing to quickly go to the front to eliminate Chiang to vent this anger." Warriors from the fourth, fifth, and sixth platoons of the fourth company said: "Let us immediately go to the front to defeat Chiang Kai-shek, who oppresses the people, and rescue the working people and class brothers in the Chiang-controlled areas from the fire pit and the sea of ​​suffering created by Chiang Kai-shek. Let them also quickly gain freedom, happiness, and turn over." All the comrades in the first company unanimously requested their superiors to realize their highest aspiration, to go to the front and "strive to be heroes."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 6th] Li Zhentang, his uncles, brothers, and cousins, twelve turned-over peasants from Wenshui County, collectively joined the People's Liberation Army with weapons, becoming a good story in the land reform in central Shanxi. The Li brothers were from Shanghetou Village in Wenshui. After the liberation of the area, they joined the militia one after another. They actively fought against Yan Xishan's puppet troops for two years, killing 30 enemies, seizing 10 guns and a grenade launcher. During the land reform, the Li brothers became active members of the poor peasants, and were successively selected by the masses as village cadres. After Yan Xishan's puppet troops reoccupied Shanghetou, their family property was completely confiscated, forcing dozens of members of their family to flee. Eager for revenge, they unanimously signed up to join the army.
