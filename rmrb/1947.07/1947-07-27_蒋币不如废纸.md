Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 25th—Prices in Taiyuan and Linfen are skyrocketing, and Chiang currency is not as good as waste paper. Near the village of Jiade, near Linfen, paper mills have recently been using ten thousand yuan of Chiang currency to buy Chiang currency of less than one thousand yuan, such as hundred yuan, ten yuan, and five yuan notes, for papermaking. They say, "The waste paper bought with ten thousand yuan notes is not as cost-effective as collecting notes of less than one thousand yuan." Prices in Taiyuan are soaring, with wheat flour rising to 12,000 yuan per catty, and corn flour rising to 7,000 to 8,000 yuan per catty (all Chiang currency).

　　蒋币不如废纸
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫二十五日电】太原、临汾物价飞涨，蒋币已不如废纸。临汾附近贾德村一带纸厂，近用万元蒋币，收买千元以下百元、十元、五元之蒋币作造纸用，他们说：“万元票子买到的废纸，还不如收千元以下的票子合算。”太原物价扶摇直上，白面每斤涨至一万二千元，玉茭面每斤涨至七千至八千元（以上均蒋币）。
