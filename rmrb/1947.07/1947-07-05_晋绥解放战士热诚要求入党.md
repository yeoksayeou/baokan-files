Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 2nd. On the eve of the Chinese Communist Party's anniversary, a unit of the Jin-Sui People's Liberation Army received several applications from liberated soldiers requesting to join the Party. Among them, Chen Jianhong, a liberated soldier from a certain regiment, wrote in his application: "1. I request to join the Communist Party to overthrow bloodsuckers like Fang Huaiqing; my family farmed 30 mu of land for the big landlord Fang Huaiqing, and we had to pay eight shi of rent regardless of the harvest. My whole family had to work for him like cattle and horses all year round. Now I know that all poor people are one family, and only by uniting closely and resolutely following the Communist Party to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, who supports landlords and rich men, can inhuman beings like Fang Huaiqing be completely overthrown. 2. I request to join the Communist Party to liberate the oppressed soldiers in Hu Zongnan's area - I was sold by Fang Huaiqing to the special company of Hu Zongnan's 90th Division, where I suffered endless beatings and abuse. If I didn't sing the songs well, the platoon leader Liu Zhongtao would beat me so badly that I couldn't eat for a week. One night, when I was on guard duty, my gun went off, and Liu Zhongtao beat my hand so badly that I couldn't even hold a bowl. A new recruit, Yu Zhaolin, who had just arrived and didn't know the rules, was beaten to death by Liu Zhongtao with two punches... I can't possibly finish describing these inhumane things. I can't forget those friends who are still suffering. 3. I request to join the Communist Party to achieve the independence and freedom of the Chinese nation. We served American officers in Hu Zongnan's area, and I personally saw American soldiers pulling our women compatriots into cars and raping them; they regarded Chinese people as slaves, but Chiang Kai-shek treated them as foreign fathers and sold out China's sovereignty. I know that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can the Chinese nation achieve independence and freedom." Chen Jianhong's conditions for requesting to join the Party were: "In the Qinghuabian battle, I captured three guns, restrained three prisoners, and used battlefield shouts to bring over twelve Hu army soldiers, exceeding my meritorious service plan of challenging all the liberated soldiers in the entire battalion."

　　晋绥解放战士热诚要求入党
    【新华社晋绥二日电】晋绥人民解放军某部在中国共产党的诞辰纪念前夕，接获若干解放战士申请入党志愿书。其中某团解放战士陈健鸿在志愿书中写道：“一、我要求加入共产党打倒方怀庆那样的吸血鬼；我家种了大地主方怀庆三十亩地，收成好不好都要八石租子，我一家大小什么活还都得给他干，一年到头当牛马。我现在知道天下穷人是一家，只有穷人团结紧，坚决跟共产党走，打倒给地主老财撑腰的蒋介石，象方怀庆那样没人心的东西才能彻底打倒。二、我要求加入共产党解放胡宗南那里被压迫的士兵——我被方怀庆卖给胡宗南九十师特务连挨打受气说不完，歌子没唱好，叫排长刘中涛打得一礼拜不能吃饭，黑夜上岗枪走了火，我的手叫刘中涛打肿得饭碗都不能端。新兵于照麟刚来不懂规矩，刘中涛两拳头打死了他……这些惨无人道的事情，我说也说不完。我忘不了那些还在受痛苦的朋友。三、我要求加入共产党求得中华民族的独立自由。我们在胡宗南那里侍候过美国军官，我亲眼看见美国兵把我们的妇女同胞拉到汽车里强奸；他们把中国人看成奴隶，可是蒋介石却把他们当做洋爸爸，把中国的主权出卖。我知道只有在共产党领导下，才能使中华民族独立自由。”陈健鸿请求入党的条件为：“青化砭战斗我缴了三支枪，扭住了三个俘虏，并用战场喊话过来十二个胡军士兵，超过了我向全营解放战士挑战的立功计划。”
