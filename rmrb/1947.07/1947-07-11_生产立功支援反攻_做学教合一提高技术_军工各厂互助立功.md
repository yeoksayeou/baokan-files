    Production Merit to Support the Counter-Offensive
    Combining Learning, Doing, and Teaching to Improve Technology
    Military Factories Helping Each Other to Achieve Merit

    [This newspaper reported] The merit campaign in the military factories has greatly enhanced the workers' class consciousness, giving full play to their initiative and creativity. Since the model worker movement last year, merit campaigns of increasing production, donating money, donating labor, and saving resources have been successively launched. This February, the political work conference focused on the spontaneous actions and creations of various factories, clearly put forward the slogan of "Creating Liu Bocheng Factories," and the upsurge of production competition quickly expanded from person to person to factory to factory, with surging enthusiasm. The workers and staff spontaneously proposed to strive to equip a heavy artillery company for the front lines. During the movement, the output of various factories increased month by month. For example, the sand casting of × factory exceeded 30% in February compared to January, and exceeded February by 2% in March. Li Laiqing, an apprentice in Factory No. 1, doubled his output in March compared to February. In the entire spring production, × factory exceeded the original plan by 100%. This movement fully demonstrated the consciousness and mass character of the movement. For example, the monthly production plans were discussed and formulated by the workers themselves, which gave greater play to the enthusiasm of the workers. In April, the fitters of × factory set their own plan which was 22% higher than the original plan proposed by the factory department, and finally exceeded their self-set plan. The same was true for many factories, with the self-set plans generally higher than those proposed by the factory department, and the completion often exceeded the plan. Many worker comrades posted their self-set plans in front of the machine tools, and completed them with high labor enthusiasm, working hard regardless of fatigue. For example, the number of processed parts in × factory in February accounted for more than 18% of the work that should be done. Worker hero Cannonball King Zhen Rongdian worked for 14 hours a day for seven or eight consecutive days. Many worker comrades worked for more than 14 hours. They unanimously believed that "equipping a heavy artillery company" was a glorious feat. In addition to donating labor, they also spontaneously donated money. Many comrades donated their beloved items that they had saved for many years, such as gold rings and watches. For example, Wang Binglin and his wife from × factory wore tattered clothes all year round, and this time they proposed to donate 50 kilograms of millet every month. By the end of May, the amount of money donated had reached more than 24 million yuan. New innovations have been made in leadership methods, that is, mastering the leadership method of giving play to positive factors and overcoming negative aspects, changing the practice of simply attacking mistakes, but helping him to create achievements, improve his work confidence, and gain the respect of the masses, and the enthusiasm will naturally be given play. For example, Comrade Liu Shan from × factory was relatively backward in the past, said strange things, and had been expelled from the trade union. In the two movements, the leadership paid attention to praising his advantages. He changed, actively processed parts himself, and patiently educated apprentices, which greatly promoted the entire class. Many comrades who had problems in the past have been transformed in this movement, and gradually gave play to their enthusiasm and strived to make contributions to the people. In terms of technical education for workers, in the past it was deeply felt that the objects were complex and there were no suitable teaching materials. In this movement, this problem was also solved due to the creativity of the workers. For example, the workers and staff of Factory No. 1 organized a technical research association, and the old craftsmen were organized to exchange and promote production experience and technology. × factory raised questions from practical work problems and gave comprehensive answers. Many factories convened class leaders and technically good people to study together, and then used the research results to educate everyone, improve everyone's technology, and strive for everyone to make contributions. This teaching method of combining learning, doing, and teaching, and concentrating the wisdom and creativity of the masses and then returning to the masses, has been very effective and has greatly promoted the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers. For example, Comrade Chen Zhaoxiang of Factory No. 1 invented a tool in January, which increased the output by one and a half times, and invented another one in February, which increased the output by another 70%. Comrade Wu Zhenchang invented a small car for car ××, which increased the original output by one time, and saved two workers and one small car. During the movement, various factories were constantly being transformed, and new creations and inventions continued to emerge, which continuously improved output and quality, and continuously saved materials and manpower.

### 生产立功支援反攻  做学教合一提高技术  军工各厂互助立功

    生产立功支援反攻
    做学教合一提高技术
    军工各厂互助立功
    【本报讯】军工处各厂立功运动，大大提高了工人的阶级觉悟，使他们的积极性与创造性得到了高度的发扬。自去年劳模运动以来，各厂增产、献金、献工、节约的立功运动相继开展。今年二月政工会议集中各厂的自发行动和创造，明确提出“创造刘伯承工厂”的号召，生产竞赛热潮很快从人与人扩展到厂与厂，热情澎湃，职工们自动提出为装备一个重炮连献给前方而奋斗。运动中，各厂产量逐月提高：如×厂翻砂，以一月为标准，二月即超过百分之三十，三月即超过二月百分之二。一厂学徒李来庆三月超过二月产量一倍，整个春季生产，×厂有超过原订计划百分之百的。这个运动充分表现了运动的自觉性与群众性。如每月生产计划，都是职工同志自己讨论制定，这使职工们的积极性有了更大的发挥，四月份×厂钳工自订的计划比原来厂部拟的提高百分之二十二，最后又超出了自订的计划。各厂也多如此，一般自订均比厂部拟的提高，完成时又多超过计划。工人同志们不少把自订的计划贴在机床跟前，以高度的劳动热忱来完成它，加油加工，不顾疲劳。如×厂二月份加工数即占应做工数的百分之十八强。工人英雄炮弹王甄荣典，每天作十四小时竟一连达七、八天。不少工人同志都连干十四小时以上。他们一致认为“装备一个重炮连”是一个顶光荣的壮举。献工外又自流自发的献金，很多同志把保存多年的心爱物品如金戒指、手表等都献出来。如×厂王炳林夫妇，一年四季穿着破衣服，这次还提出每月要献五十斤小米。至五月底，献金数即达二千四百余万元之巨。在领导方法上有了新的创造，即掌握发挥积极因素克服消极面的领导方法，改变了对错误单纯打击的作法，而帮助他创造出成绩，提高其工作信心，得到群众尊重，积极性自然发扬。如×厂刘山同志，过去较落后，说怪话，曾开除过工会会籍；两次运动中，领导上注意表扬其优点，他转变了，自己积极加工，且耐心教育学徒，对全班有很大推动。不少过去有毛病的同志，这次运动中都转变了，且逐渐发挥其积极性，争为人民立功，在工人技术教育方面，过去深感对象复杂，无适当教材；这次运动中由于发挥了工人们的创造性，这一问题也得到解决。如一厂职工组织了技术研究会，老工匠们都组织起来，生产经验技术得以交流和发扬。×厂从实际工作问题中由工人提出疑问，综合给以解答。不少厂都是召集班长及技术好的共同研究，再以研究所得教育大家，提高大家技术，争取人人立功。这个做学教合一，并集中群众的智慧与创造再回到群众中去的教育方法，收效很大，大大发挥了工人的积极性创造性。如一厂陈兆祥同志，一月份发明了一个工具，使产量提高一倍半，二月份又发明了一个，产量又提高百分之七十。武振昌同志发明一部车××的小车，比原产量提高一倍，且节省了两个工人和一部小车。运动中各厂都不断有所改造，新的创造发明不断涌现，使产量质量不断提高，材料人力不断节省。（军工处政治部）
