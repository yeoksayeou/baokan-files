Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th—The Chinese Communist Party spokesperson recently commented on the U.S. government's continued supply of large quantities of military supplies to the Chiang Kai-shek government, including 130 million rounds of ammunition worth over $6.5 million, and its intention to provide China with more extensive "economic aid," stating: The heinous face of American imperialism is further exposed by this. At a time when American public opinion has become increasingly clear about the corruption, reaction, and hopelessness of the Chiang Kai-shek government, and when Chiang Kai-shek has been waging a full-scale anti-people civil war for a full year, the U.S. government openly and without concealment hands over military supplies to Chiang Kai-shek to slaughter the Chinese people. Every child and relative of those killed by American bullets in China will forever remember that the deceased was killed by the U.S. government through the hands of Chiang Kai-shek! Without the aid of American imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek would not dare to and could not fight the civil war. The American criminals want to wash the blood off their hands, claiming that this batch of bullets was still an obligation from the war against Japan, and that they are only suitable for the caliber of Chinese guns, as if they would not be moral human beings and would be punished by God if they did not use these military supplies to kill millions of Chinese people! The U.S. government's failure to realize the 500 million yuan loan before the end of June is an attempt to create an illusion that the U.S. is not enthusiastic about the Chinese civil war; in fact, since Marshall proposed the loan last March, many times more than 500 million yuan in surplus military supplies, mobile military supplies, warships, airplanes, etc., have already been handed over to Chiang Kai-shek. The U.S. government has indicated that it is canceling the 500 million yuan loan merely to realize more extensive aid. This transaction did not succeed only because the guarantees given by the traitor Chiang Kai-shek were not enough; in other words, it was because even greater traitorous conditions were required from Chiang Kai-shek in exchange! The Chinese Communist Party reiterates that it will never recognize all these despicable and bloody deals between the imperialists and the traitors. In order to survive, the Chinese people must work harder and continue to seize American military supplies from Chiang Kai-shek to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek, the running dog of the American aggressors.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th—The American authorities have announced the signing of a contract with Chiang Kai-shek to provide a large amount of ammunition to Chiang Kai-shek to slaughter the Chinese people, and announced that after the expiration of the Export-Import Bank loan deadline on June 30th, they will continue to provide loans to Chiang Kai-shek to carry out the civil war. The U.S. Information Service and United Press International, Washington, 27th, reported: The United States sold 130 million rounds of surplus bullets worth $6,566,589 to Chiang Kai-shek to "counter the CCP" and to provide the National Government (Chiang's government) with "moral" and material support. The selling price is about one-tenth of the original price. According to UPI: The announcement of the sale of ammunition is coordinated with the statement of the Export-Import Bank, which stated: The 500 million yuan loan planned for China (Chiang's government) in 1946 will expire on June 30th, but if China (Chiang's government) can provide the bank with reasonable repayment guarantees, the bank will consider providing credit loans for China's (Chiang's government) special projects. U.S. State Department officials stated: The United States is now "free" to sell various "surplus materials" to the Chinese government (referring to Chiang's government), and export licenses can be granted for military equipment purchased through "commercial" channels.

　　美续以军火援蒋屠杀中国人民
  　中共发言人发表评论
    【新华社陕北卅日电】中共发言人顷就美国政府继续供给蒋介石政府大量军火，包括价值六百五十余万美元的一万万三千万发子弹，并将给中国以更广泛的“经济援助”一节，发表评论称：美国帝国主义的凶恶面目，由此更进一步暴露了。在美国舆论已经更加明了蒋介石政府的腐败、反动、无可救药的时候，当蒋介石进行全面的反人民的内战已经整整一年的时候，美国政府公然毫不隐瞒自己的真面目，把军火交给蒋介石，屠杀中国人民。全中国每个被美国子弹杀死者的子女和亲友，都要永远记住死者是被美国政府假手于蒋介石杀死的！没有美国帝国主义的援助，蒋介石是不敢和不能打内战的，美国罪人们想要洗掉自己手上的血，推说这批子弹还是对日战争时的义务，又说它们只适合于中国枪的口径，好象如果不用他们的这些军火来杀死成百万中国人，他们就不算有道德的人类，就要受上帝惩罚一般！美国政府不在六月底以前实现五万万元贷款，是企图造成一种美国对中国内战不热心的幻象；其实，白从马歇尔去年三月提出该项贷款以来，数倍于五万万元的剩余军火、移动军火、军舰、飞机等等，早已交给了蒋介石。美国政府已经表示取消五万万元的贷款，仅仅为了实现更广泛的援助。这次的交易没有成功，仅仅因为卖国贼蒋介石所给的担保还不够；换句话说，是因为要换取蒋介石更大的卖国条件！中国共产党重申对于帝国主义者和卖国贼的这一切可耻的血腥买卖，决不承认。中国人民为了生存，必须更加努力，继续从蒋介石手中夺取美国的军火，来消灭美国侵略者的走狗蒋介石。
    【新华社陕北三十日电】美国当局已宣布与蒋介石签订合同，以大量弹药援蒋屠杀中国人民，并宣布六月三十日进出口银行贷款限期届满以后，继续以贷款供给蒋介石进行内战。美国新闻处及合众社华盛顿二十七日电称：美国以价值六百五十六万六千五百八十九元之剩余子弹一亿三千万发，售予蒋介石以“对抗中共”，而予国民政府（蒋政府）以“道义”及物资之支持。其售价约为原价之十分之一。据合众社称：出售弹药之发表与进出口银行之声明相配合，后者声称：一九四六年归划中国（蒋政府）之五亿货款至六月三十日终期，然中国（蒋政府）如能予该银行以合理之偿付保证，则该行将考虑为中国（蒋政府）特殊计划贷以信用贷款。美国务院官员声称：美国现可“自由”向中国政府（指蒋政府）出售各种“剩余物资”，对经由“商务”途径购买之军事装备，可准予出口签证云。
