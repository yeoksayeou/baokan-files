Yan Army Songs
    Yu Bo
    Several Yan Army songs that were popular among the Yan Army officers who laid down their weapons during the Zhengtai Campaign were told to reporters during casual conversation. From these, we can see how indignant the Shanxi people and officers and soldiers of the Yan Army at all levels are towards Yan Xishan:
    (1)
    The Second War Zone is said to have a hundred thousand (referring to troops).
    The families of administrative cadres account for half.
    The rest are children and old men,
    Eight years of war, standing on both sides of the Yellow River.
    This song is extremely popular in the Yan Army, meaning that Yan's so-called "hundred thousand troops" are nothing but the old and weak. It also states that the Yan Army did not resist Japan.
    (2)
    Training soldiers with sorghum flour,
    "Victory" bonus is only half-paid,
    Never full, day in and day out,
    How pitiful, how pitiful.
    This refers to the provisions of the Yan Army soldiers after the Japanese surrender, and the so-called "Victory Bonus" was only half-paid after several months. In fact, many junior officers did not receive even half. For example, lieutenant-level officers in the 45th Division mostly received only 55 yuan. (They should have received more than 20,000 yuan) - this was said by Chen Wusheng, quartermaster of the 7th Company of the 1st Regiment of the 46th Division of Yan.
    (3)
    Yan Xishan is not a human,
    Demolishing temples to build blockhouses,
    Small blockhouses are the tombs of soldiers,
    Large blockhouses are the death place of commanders.
    According to Tang Jinming, a major captain of the Yan puppet Pingding Self-Defense Brigade: To build bunkers and blockhouses in Taiyuan, officers and soldiers had to "donate bunkers." Junior officers not only contributed labor but also money, with lieutenant-level officers contributing about 10,000 yuan a month.
    (4)
    Integration of soldiers and farmers is good,
    Grass grows everywhere,
    Men become soldiers,
    Women run away with others.
    Niu Yinqi, a captured Yan Army colonel deputy adjutant of the Yangshou Campaign, said to the reporter upon meeting him: "My first impression after arriving in the liberated area was that there was no wasteland here, but there-- (referring to the Yan-controlled area) it was not the case. People grew weeds in the fields everywhere to avoid the soldiers."
    (5)
    Thirteen senior cadres coaxing an old man,
    A big bastard leading a group of little bastards.
    Zhang Guodong, the captured Yan Independent 10th Brigade's 2nd Regiment Colonel Commander of Shouyang, said when discussing Yan Xishan's future: "Over there, it's just the top deceiving the bottom, and the bottom deceiving the top. When our regimental-level officers or higher meet, who dares to talk about the plight of the soldiers below!"

　　阎军之歌
    玉波
    在正太战役中放下武器的阎军官，闲谈时告诉给记者几首阎军中的流行歌谣，从这里我们可以看出山西人民和阎军各级官兵对阎锡山如何愤懑：
    （一）
    二战区号称十万（指军队）。
    行政干部家属就占一半。
    剩了些娃娃老汉，
    抗战八年，站在黄河两岸。
    这首歌在阎军中极为流行，意指阎所谓“十万大军”不过是老弱罢了。并说出阎军没有抗战。
    （二）
    高粱面把兵练，
    “胜利”奖金发一半，
    一天到晚吃不饱，
    说多可怜多可怜。
    这是指日本投降后阎军士兵的给养，并且所谓“胜利奖金”，隔了好几个月才发给一半，其实好多下级官兵一半也没有得到。如四十五师的尉级军官大部只得了五十五元。（应该两万多元）——这是阎四十六师一团七连司务长陈武生讲的。
    （三）
    阎锡山不是人，
    拆庙宇，盖炮台，
    小炮台是当兵的坟墓，
    大炮台是指挥官的死处。
    据阎伪平定自卫大队少校队长唐金铭讲：太原修碉堡、炮台还要官兵们“献碉”，下级军官不但出劳动力，还要出钱，尉级军官一个月就一万元左右。
    （四）
    兵农合一好，
    遍地都是草，
    男的当了兵，
    女的跟人跑。
    阳寿战役被俘之阎军总队上校副官牛荫麒一见记者就说：“我到解放区后第一个印象就是这边没有一片荒地，那边——（指阎管区）却不然，人民为了躲兵，到处地里长荒草。”
    （五）
    十三个高干哄一个老汉，
    一个大混蛋带一群小混蛋。
    寿阳被俘之阎独十总队二团上校团长张国栋在座谈阎锡山出路时说：“在那边就是上哄下，下哄上，我们团以上主官开会时，谁敢说下面士兵困苦情形！”
