Universal Weeding and Insecticide Application to Protect Seedlings
Licheng Strengthens Technical Guidance Across Regions

[This newspaper's Licheng news] In early June, all seedlings in the county had emerged from the soil, ranging from just over an inch to three or four inches in height. Due to the drought, oil drought, wireworms, walnut worms, and other pests were widespread. Therefore, the leadership proposed "implementing technical guidance and launching a seedling protection campaign," organizing the masses to thin and weed the seedlings and kill the pests. The technical committees in various villages universally studied the techniques of thinning and weeding. In order to save acreage and nourish the soil, they universally thinned the seedlings early and used small hoes to surround the soil to avoid damaging the seedlings. During the weeding process, they put forward the slogans "Water in the hoe" and "Weeding during drought," organizing shallow hoeing and close hoeing. Especially after light rain, they seized the time for universal hoeing. This not only removed weeds and loosened the soil, but more importantly, it nourished the soil (destroyed soil structure) and removed insects (destroyed ant nests to reduce oil drought). Under the slogan of "competing with insects for food," the Shicunjin Hero Group studied insect control and proposed four methods: 1. Shallow hoeing, 2. Dipping grass nodes in asphalt and inserting them into the seedling roots to poison them, 3. Spreading cypress branches and leaves on the seedling roots to poison them, 4. Organizing women and children to catch the insects. Through the Hero Group members leading everyone in various groups, this was carried out universally. Children alone caught three thousand insects, completely eliminating the pests. Labor Hero Lu Jicai creatively used Yangtao twig roots (two catties of roots, ten bowls of water, and three taels of black alum to boil poisonous water, also using locust tree roots, Chinese toon roots, tobacco pipes, etc.) to poison and kill oil drought (dipping leaves in water). Using the slogan "People fear disease, seedlings fear insects," he promoted the use of this method to treat 1,100 mu of cotton oil drought in the Fifth District. Zhang Changqun discovered that insects bite the seedlings to death overnight without moving. It is best to chase the roots and dig to kill them early in the morning. The Fifth District eliminated insects in this way on 300 mu. Cotton planting hero Jin Yuliang created the method of using grass sticks dipped in sesame oil to lure ants and other insects to concentrate them and burn them with wheat straw fire, and spreading fine hot soil on oil drought at noon to burn and kill them, with great results. In order to fight the drought for a long time, various places universally dug ponds and wells and opened small channels. A total of 65 ponds were dug in the county, 313 wells were dug, 18 new wells were dug, and 1 new pond was dug.

[This newspaper's news] The masses in Xichuan, Xiangyuan, have created two methods to protect field seedlings and fight drought. 1. They carry well water to the toilet and mix it with manure water, irrigating an average of about 20 loads per mu, which can not only maintain the growth of seedlings but also serve as topdressing fertilizer. 2. Hoe frequently to concentrate the moisture on the field seedlings, and surround the seedlings with soil to prevent them from being blown by the wind. Dai Jinsheng and 18 other households used well water and manure to irrigate 83 mu, and more hoeing was done on 183 mu. Later, this was promoted to the entire administrative village, irrigating a total of 158 mu of field seedlings in 41 households, and more hoeing was done on 458 mu.

　　普锄杀虫保护青苗
  　黎城各地加强技术指导
    【本报黎城讯】六月初全县青苗即全部出土寸余至三四寸，天旱不雨，各地普遍发现油旱、铁丝虫、核桃虫等侵害青苗，因此领导上提出了“贯彻技术指导，展开保护青苗运动”，组织群众进行间苗锄苗捕杀害虫。各村技委会普遍研究了间苗锄苗技术，为了省垧养垧，各地普遍早间并用小锄等围土避免损苗，锄苗中提出了“锄头有水”“旱天锄苗”行动口号，组织进行浅锄抿锄，特别是小雨后抓紧普锄，这样不仅除草松土，更重要的是养垧（破坏土壤组织）、除虫（破坏蚂蚁窝少生油旱）。在与虫夺食口号下，石寸金英雄集团研究除虫提出四项办法：一、浅锄，二、草圪节蘸柏油插在苗根毒杀，三、用柏树枝叶面撒在苗根毒杀，四、组织妇女儿童捕捉，通过英雄集团分子到各组带领大家普遍进行，仅儿童即捉虫三千，将害虫全数扑灭。劳英卢计才创用洋桃梢根（二斤根十碗水三两黑矾熬毒素水，也有用槐树根、椿树根、烟杆等）毒杀油旱（用水蘸叶）。他用“人怕病苗怕虫”口号，推动五区用此法治棉花油旱千一百亩。张长群发现虫咬死青苗一夜不动，一早追根刨杀最好，五区这样除虫三百亩。植棉英雄靳玉良创造用草棒蘸香油诱蚂蚁等虫集中用麦杆火烧杀，正午用细热土撤油旱烧杀等收效根大。各地为了长期与旱灾斗争，普遍掏池掏井开小渠，计全县掏池六十五个，掏井三百一十三个，新打井十八个，新打池一个。
    【本报讯】襄垣西川群众创造出两种保护田苗办法，向旱灾作斗争。一、他们把井水担到厕所，和圊水相参，每亩平均浇灌二十担左右，既能保持幼苗生长，还能顶追肥。二、即时多锄，使水分集中到田苗上，用土将苗围好，不易使风吹动。戴金生等十八户用井水和圊浇灌八十三亩多锄的有一百八十三亩，以后推广到了全行政村，合计浇灌田苗四十一户一百五十八亩地，多锄的有四百五十八亩。（增产备荒小报）
