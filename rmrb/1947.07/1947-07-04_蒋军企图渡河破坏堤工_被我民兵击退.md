　　【This newspaper, Ji Lu Yu, 1st telegram】On the evening of June 20th, at 8 o'clock, seven Chiang Kai-shek troop ships, under the cover of artillery fire, advanced towards Hanliuzhuang in the second district of Hexi County (parts of Xin County, Pingyin, and Erping), attempting to cross the river and destroy the dike construction project. They were discovered by the river defense militia of the county. As they approached the river's center, they were met with intense concentrated fire, eventually being repelled.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Jin Ji Lu Yu, 1st telegram】This reporter patrolled the twenty-mile long Yellow River embankment from Foulou to Liuqiao within Shou Zhang territory. This area is the dike construction section undertaken by Yanggu County farmers. Shovels flashed, yellow earth flew everywhere, carts shuttled back and forth, and songs echoed from above and below the embankment. I was captivated by the farmers' enthusiastic competition when suddenly an air raid alarm sounded in the distance. The farmers put down their dike construction tools and dove into individual air raid shelters. Within five minutes, the area was deserted. After Chiang's planes circled several times and left, angry curses erupted from all directions. According to accounts, there were as many as five air raids per day, and Chiang's planes frequently strafed dike construction workers. When the reporter traveled to the river bend 400 meters southwest of the Sunkou dangerous section, militiamen guarding the new dike vigilantly monitored Cai Lou, occupied by the 222nd Regiment of the 74th Brigade of Chiang's troops on the opposite bank. On the morning of the 16th, Chiang's troops fired densely with machine guns, bullets rained down on the top of the dike, and dirt flew. The farmers continued to build the dike calmly as usual. At 11 o'clock, Chiang's troops fired mortar shells, most of which landed on the back of the dike. A farmer named Chen Xigui was buried in the soil by the explosion, some were splattered with water, and some were covered in mud. The farmers were extremely indignant and voluntarily canceled their noon nap and started work early. Workers from Xuezhuang and Jiazhuang refused to return to the village for meals and simply continued working. While carrying soil, they shouted: "Comrades, Old Chiang's American shells can't scare us, we are building dikes for ourselves!" The farmers' shouts drowned out the sporadic sniper fire from the opposite bank.

　　蒋军企图渡河破坏堤工
  　被我民兵击退
    【本报冀鲁豫一日电】六月二十日晚八时蒋记兵船七只在炮火掩护下向河西县（新县、平阴、二平各一部）二区韩刘庄驶进，企图渡河破坏修堤工程，当被该县河防民兵发觉，待其驶进河心即以集中火力猛烈射击，卒将其击退。
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫一日电】记者巡礼于寿张境内佛楼至刘桥长达二十里的黄河堤岸上，该地是阳谷县农民修堤地段，铁锹黄土到处飞舞，大车往来穿梭，堤上堤下歌声不绝，我被农民们竞赛热潮吸引得呆住了，忽然远处传来空袭警报声，农民们放下修堤工具钻进单人防空洞，五分钟内人烟绝迹，蒋机盘旋数遭逸去后，四处立刻传来激愤的诟骂声。据谈每日防空要有五次之多，蒋机扫射修堤工人成为常事。当记者行至孙口险工西南四百公尺处之河湾上，持枪守卫新堤的民兵虎视耽耽监视着对岸蒋军七十四旅二二二团盘踞的蔡楼。十六日上午，蒋军以机枪密集扫射，子弹纷落堤顶，打得泥土飞扬，农民继续修堤镇静如常。十一时蒋军又发射迫击炮弹，大部落于堤坝的背河堤上。一位叫陈希桂的农民被炸得埋在土里，有的被溅得一身水，有的被迸了一身泥。农民们愤恨极了，自动取消午睡提前上工，薛庄、贾庄的工人拒绝回村吃饭索性连干下去，他们一面挑土，一面大喊：“伙计们，老蒋的美国炮弹唬不住咱们，修堤为自己！”农民们呐喊淹没了对岸不时送来的冷枪声。
