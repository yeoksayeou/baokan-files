　　For the sake of commemorating the international friend
  　Handan Harrison Hospital
    Officially opened on July 1st
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] Dr. Tillson L. Harrison, M.D., from Canada, was deeply concerned about the diseases and suffering of the Chinese people. In January of this year, he personally brought medicine to the Liberated Areas and unfortunately passed away in Zhangqiu County due to illness. The Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government decided as early as February 26th to establish hospitals in Handan and Zhangqiu respectively to commemorate him. After several months of active preparation, the Handan Harrison Hospital officially opened on July 1st, with Zhu Lian, Director of the Border Region Health Bureau, concurrently serving as the president. At present, in order to meet local demands, the focus is mainly on outpatient treatment, with approximately one hundred people from nearby organizations and the public seeking medical attention every day. According to Director Zhu Lian, due to difficult medical conditions, inpatient beds can temporarily accommodate 50 people, and it is planned to increase this to 150 to 200 beds after autumn. We urgently hope for strong assistance from all parties.

    七月一日正式开幕
    【本报特讯】加拿大哈励生大夫（ＴＩＬＬＳＯＮＬ．ＨＡＲＲＩＳＯＮＭ．Ｄ．）对中国人民之疾病痛苦，甚为关切，今年一月间亲携药品到解放区，不幸在张秋县病逝，晋冀鲁豫边区政府早在二月二十六日即决定在邯郸与张秋分别设立医院，以资纪念。经数月来之积极筹备，现邯郸哈励生医院，已于七月一日正式开幕，由边区卫生局朱琏局长兼任院长。目前为适应地方要求，主要着重门诊治疗，附近机关团体及民众就诊者，每日在百十人左右。据朱琏局长谈：因医药条件困难，住院床位暂可收容五十人，拟秋后增至一百五十到二百床位，急盼各方鼎力襄助。
