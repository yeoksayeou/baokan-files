    Seize the Time to Organize Labor for a Crash Planting
    Shantou Village’s Planting Has Sprouted
    Shexian County Universally Planting After Light Rain
    [Our newspaper, Jincheng News] On June 22nd, a heavy rain fell in Liuquan and Shantou natural villages in the fifth district of Jincheng. Village Chief Chang convened a meeting of mutual aid team leaders to discuss crash planting. Some said, "The rain was too heavy, it didn't soak through, it's not good to plant, it won't help, let's wait a few more days." Others said, "Let's plant what we can, and don't wait for rain again, it will delay things again." The village chief, based on everyone's opinions, decided on a plan: 1. On the stubble fields that have enough rain (referring to land after wheat is harvested without plowing), those three or four *li* away can be planted by carrying water; distant land can be planted with mung beans, which are not afraid of drought and can sprout when it rains, and also plant radishes. 2. The flooded land, most of which has been soaked with water, can be planted with white beans and other crops. 3. In autumn fields with missing seedlings, seize the time to replant. After the meeting, each team immediately mobilized all and half laborers to divide the work, threshing and planting. The village has a total of 670 *mu* of stubble fields (referring to wheat fields), and completed over 300 *mu* of white beans, over 100 *mu* of mung beans, and planted corn, radishes, etc., and replanted 108.4 *mu* of millet fields within five days. Under the promotion of this village, Shang Liuquan, Dong Liuquan, and other villages completed more than 1,000 *mu* of stubble fields in five days. Now the seedlings in this village have all emerged, and villages that have not planted are actively seizing the time to plant and replant. (Jiang Lin)
    [Our newspaper News] On July 2nd, Shexian County had about two fingers of rain. The masses in various villages were still hesitant, fearing that planting would not lead to sprouting and ruin the seeds, but also fearing that not planting would delay things. Just at this time, the county party committee's emergency call came. Li Tingwang, the political director of Fushan Kiln, convened a meeting of team leaders and conveyed the message. Then, he went among the masses to mobilize, using slogans such as "If people are busy, the heavens are not; if the heavens are busy, it's only for one time" (meaning that if the sky doesn't rain completely, we can't just wait for rain to plant; if we plant and the sky rains, won't it sprout immediately?) and "Organized people can conquer nature" to encourage the mood of the whole village to fight against the drought. On July 3rd, they immediately took action. All and half laborers were converted into 99 full laborers, with 54 animal power. In two days, they planted a total of 925 *mu* of millet and corn, planting all the bare land and half of the wheat stubble land. The whole village still has 599.2 *mu* of land reserved for planting beans. After the rain in Mabulu in the third district, cadres and heroes actively led the masses to rush to plant. In order to rush to plant, the whole village organized people to pull seed drills, and the preparedness committee coordinated labor and animal power and implemented warm water seed soaking. Because cadres took the lead in breaking the masses' fear of wasting seeds, the whole village rushed to plant 90% in seven days and is continuing to plant. Cadres from Shipo returned to the village from the district overnight, going deep into each street to promote mass planting, planning to complete all planting in three days. In order to plant quickly, 15 pairs of people were organized to pull seed drills. At the same time, resident organizations helped. Except for livestock and laborers on business trips, 2,350 *mu* were planted in half a day.
    [Another News] After the rain, the second district of Shexian County organized rush planting, and found that the masses were hesitant and unwilling to plant. For example, the masses in Suobao reflected, "This little rain can only ruin the seeds, it's useless," "If we waste the seeds, we won't even have seeds left," "It's just started raining, it's still going to rain." The leadership educated the masses, explaining that the solar term has reached Minor Heat, using the common saying, "Planting three days before Minor Heat can be harvested, planting three days after will be lost," "Hoeing small seedlings during the Beginning of Autumn, one small ladle per *mu*," "If seedlings don't emerge by the End of Heat, cut them down and feed them to the cows," to inspire everyone to discuss. Some said, "If you can't bear to part with the seeds, you can't catch the seedlings." Some said, "If we plant now, another one or two fingers of rain will be enough, if we don't plant and another two fingers of rain falls, it will also be loose." They also talked about how after one or two fingers of rain fell in Haojia and Baiquan, the masses planted and another one or two fingers fell, and the seedlings all emerged, and those who didn't plant regretted it very much. This is how they got the idea across and decided to plant. Two days later, the ground dried up, and they also researched dry planting techniques: millet should be planted late, corn should be opened in the holes, and beans should be opened in the ridges with a little less rain to sprout. After such a crash, the 26 villages in the whole district planted more than 19,000 *mu*, accounting for 63% of the entire dry land, and some spring land was also planted, with half of the seedlings already caught. Because of insufficient rain, they immediately rushed to plant dry seeds and launched a water-carrying planting campaign. At first, the masses reflected, "If we carry water to plant and the shoots are burned when they emerge, it's just a waste of effort," "Carrying water in hot weather is unbearable." The leadership immediately promoted the convening of mobilization meetings in various villages, explaining the importance of carrying water to plant. Immediately, some emancipated peasants (poor peasant and farmhand backbone) responded to the call to carry water to plant. They also set rules: no visiting relatives, no going to the market, near first then far, grouping near land and concentrating and uniformly mobilizing distant land, and if water buckets were not enough, they researched taking basins and manure buckets to the fields. Each team selected people to record work points and land, thus launching a water-carrying planting campaign. (Zhisheng)
    [Our newspaper, Xingtai News] On the afternoon of the 2nd, about five fingers of rain fell in the second district of this county. The district government immediately notified all villages to complete the autumn seedling planting within three days, and sent district cadres to live in various villages to lead cultivation. Men, women, old and young, were all mobilized to seize the time and fully crash plant. The county's second primary school also had a three-day vacation starting on the 3rd, and teachers and students returned home to help with the planting work. In addition to rushing to plant during the day, the mutual aid groups plowed the land in the moonlight, and the sound of calling cattle was heard all night. According to incomplete statistics, the whole district crash planted more than 8,000 *mu*. (Yumin)

    抓紧组织劳力进行突击
    山头村抢种已出苗
    涉县小雨后普遍抢种中
    【本报晋城讯】晋城五区柳泉、山头自然村六月廿二号下了一场大雨，该村常村长召开互助组长会议讨论抢种，有的说：“雨太猛，没下透，不能种，种上不顶事，再等几天吧。”有的说：“咱还是能种啥种啥，再不要等下雨，又要耽误。”村长根据大家意见决定办法：一、够两指雨的回茬地，（指割麦后的地不犁）三、四里近的可以担毛点种，远地可种绿豆，不怕旱，见雨就可出苗，还可种萝卜。二、水淹地，大部吃透了水，可以种白豆等庄稼。三、秋地缺苗，可以抓紧补种。会后各组马上动员男女全、半劳力分工，打场的打场，种的种，该村共回茬地（指麦地）六百七十亩，五天内完成白豆三百余亩，绿豆一百余亩，又点种玉茭、萝卜等，并补种谷地一百零八亩四分。在该村推动下，上柳泉、东柳泉等村五天完成回茬地一千余亩，现该村苗已全部出土，各村未种的正在积极抢种补种中。（江琳）
    【本报讯】涉县七月二号下了二指来雨，各村群众都在犹疑不定，种罢怕出不来坏了种籽，不种地又怕耽误了。恰在这时传来了县委紧急号召，符山窑政治主任李廷旺，召开队长会议作了传达后，便到群众里边作动员，在“人忙天不忙，天忙只一场”，（意思就是天没下透雨，咱不能光等下雨种，种上天要下一场雨不是就马上出来）和组织起来人能胜天等口号下，鼓舞了全村群众向旱灾作斗争的情绪，七月三号便紧急的行动起来，全、半劳力折成全劳力九十九个，五十四个畜力，两天就种谷和玉茭共九百二十五亩，白地全部种上，麦茬地种了一半，全村还有五百九十九亩二分地留着种豆。三区马布落雨后，干部和英雄积极领导群众抢种。为了抢垧全村又组织人拉耧，由备荒委员会调剂劳畜力，实行温汤浸种。由于干部带头打破群众怕扔种籽的思想，七天工夫全村抢种到百分之九十，现正继续下种。石泊干部从区星夜回村，深入各街推动群众抢种，计划三天全部突击种完。为了种的快，又组织了十五对人拉耧，同时又有驻地机关帮助，除出差牲口和民夫外，天半即种了两千三百五十亩。
    【又讯】涉县二区雨后组织抢垧下种，发现群众思想犹豫不愿种，如索堡群众反映“下这点雨光能坏种不顶事”，“扔了种连种籽都没有了”，“已下开头了还要下哩。”领导上便教育群众，说明节令已到小暑，用俗语，“小暑前三天种能收，后三天就丢”，“立秋锄小苗一亩一小瓢”，“处暑不出头，割倒喂了牛”等启发大家圪扯，有的说：“舍不得种子捉不住小苗”。有的说：“这种上再下一、二指就行，这不种再下二指雨也松”。又谈到郝家、白泉水先下了一、二指雨群众种上了，又下了一、二指苗都出了土，没有种的很后悔，这样弄通思想才决心下种。两天过后地干了，又研究出干下种技术，谷要种晚种，玉茭亮开窑，豆子开亮垅少下点雨就能出等，经这样的突击后，全区二十六个村下种一万九千余亩，占整个旱地百分之六十三，春地还种了一部分，已有半数捉住苗了。因雨水不足紧接着抢垧种干种，又开展了担水抢种。起初群众反映：“担水种上出时烧了芽也是白误工”，“火热天气担水顶不住”。领导上即推动各村普遍召开动员大会，说明担水下种的重要后，即有部分翻身农民（贫雇骨干）响应号召担水抢种。弹音并订出不走亲戚不赶集，先近后远，近地分组远地集中统一调动，水桶不够，研究往地拿盆、担粪桶等，各组选出人记工记地，这样展开了担水抢种运动。（志胜）
    【本报邢台讯】本县二区二日下午落雨约有五指，区政府立即通知各村，在三天内完成秋苗下种，并派区干部分住各村，领导耕作，男女老少全体总动员，抓紧时间，全面突击下种。县立第二完小，亦于三日起，放假三天，师生回家，帮助下种工作。白天抢种外各互助在月光中耕地，彻夜听到唤牛声。据不完全统计，全区突击下种八千余亩。（育民）
