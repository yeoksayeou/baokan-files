    Border Region Government Represents All People of the Border Region to Salute Liu and Deng's Soldiers

    (Special Dispatch) The Border Region Government telegraphed Commander Liu, Political Commissar Deng, and all commanders and fighters of the southward crossing-the-Yellow-River troops on the 11th of this month, representing the 30 million people of the entire border region to salute them and congratulate them on the glorious victory after the prelude to the great counter-offensive was launched. The telegram reads:

    Our army victoriously launched the prelude to the great counter-offensive, breaking through the natural barrier of the Yellow River, crossing the river in the face of the enemy, and establishing a strong beachhead; in the Battle of Yuncheng, two enemy brigades were annihilated, and Juan, Ju, and Cao were successively recovered. The enemy's first line of defense was completely breached by us, and a promising Henan is about to be liberated. The enemy was terrified upon hearing the news, and the compatriots in the Chiang-occupied areas sincerely rejoiced. The good news has greatly encouraged and delighted all the people in the border region. The victorious development of the great counter-offensive, the people will surely win, and the Chiang bandits will surely be destroyed, has become a foregone conclusion. On behalf of the 30 million people in the border region, I salute the generals and all the commanders and fighters, and wish you a victorious advance!
