　　Early Prevention of Wasteful Marriage Saves 60,000 Yang

　　[Report from this newspaper] Li Yushui from Xia Yu Village, First District of Xiangyuan, got married on the 23rd of this month. His father, Li Fulin, said, "Each generation of children has their own big event, so it must be done well. Grind four *shi* of wheat, one *shi* of soybeans, make two batches of tofu, buy ten *jin* of pork, and five *jin* of wine." After hearing this, cadre Zhang Yulan hurried to explain to him and also calculated for him: four *shi* of wheat flour, each *dou* of wheat costing 1,200 yuan, totals 48,000 yuan; one *shi* of soybeans, each *dou* costing 1,000 yuan, totals 10,000 yuan; two batches of tofu, 3,000 yuan; five *jin* of wine, 2,500 yuan; ten *jin* of meat, 3,600 yuan, totaling 67,100 yuan in silver dollars. This could buy ten *shi* of corn, enough for a family of nine to survive the famine for four months if they are frugal. If he makes a big fuss, the masses will also lose work, totaling 300 workdays. According to our village's wages, five *sheng* per day totals fifteen *shi*, which can be sold for 180,000 yuan in silver dollars. Adding this to the original cost, it would cost 247,100 yuan in silver dollars. Only by presenting this calculation method did she get through to him. As a result, when he got married on the 23rd, he ate 51 *jin* of white flour and 5 *jin* of coarse flour. The masses reflected: "Chairman Mao is really good! He considers every little thing for all of us."

  　及早劝阻浪费结婚省洋六万
    【本报讯】襄垣一区下峪村李毓水，于本月二十三日结婚，他父亲李福林说：“孩们一辈一个事，可得好好办一下，磨了四石麦，一石豆，两作豆腐，买猪肉十斤，酒五斤”。干部张玉兰听到后，急忙去给他解释，又给他计算了一下，四石麦面每斗麦以一千二百元计合四万八千元，一石豆每斗一千元合洋一万元，两作豆腐三千元，五斤酒二千五百元，十斤肉三千六百元，共大洋六万七千一百元，能买玉茭十石，全家九口人节约些能渡荒四个月。如要大闹的话，群众还得误工，计共得三百个，按咱村工资，一天五升合十五石，共卖大洋一十八万元，这样一里一外，费大洋廿四万七千一百元。拿上算帐办法才打通他的思想，结果在二十三日结婚时，吃了白面五十一斤，杂面五斤。群众反映：毛主席，实在好哩！一点一滴都是为咱们大家打算。”
