Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 21st. The people's guerrilla warfare in the Ling (Shi), Jie (Xiu), and Zhai (Xian) areas in the central section of the Tongpu Railway has developed from scattered activities of capturing the enemy sporadically to concentrating forces to annihilate the enemy in large numbers. This characteristic is particularly prominent in Jiexiu County. During the 35-day mass grain protection battle from June 1st to July 5th, there were 20 battles of various sizes, killing, wounding, and capturing 279 enemies, including the enemy company commander Yan Jiafu and the heads of the "Returning Home Corps" and below. Five small cannons, six machine guns, eighty rifles and short guns, and one grenade launcher were seized. Both the annihilation of the enemy and the seizures were unprecedented. The North Jia battle, the Longtou battle, the Sendai battle last month, and the Zongxian Village battle on the 5th of this month all achieved the annihilation of the enemy by squads, platoons, and companies with the same strength as the enemy and at great cost. There has also been rapid improvement in tactics. For example, the Third District used "digging out the heart" tactics to kill and wound four enemies and force the newly established Aozi Ridge stronghold to retreat. The Longfeng Joint Defense Zone invented the "return horse mine" and created street warfare tactics. The enemy in Nanzhuang is only two miles away from Longfeng, but they dare not enter Longfeng when looking at it. Special-class combat hero Luo Laiguan also invented an "air collision mine," wounding nine enemies.

　　集中力量大股歼敌
  　同蒲中段群众游击战术提高
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫二十一日电】同蒲中段灵（石）、介（休）、翟（县）等地群众游击战争，已由分散活动零星捕敌发展到集中力量大股歼敌。此一特点尤以介休最为突出，该县在六月一日至七月五日三十五天群众性的保粮战中，大小战斗二十次，毙伤俘敌中队长阎嘉福及还乡团团长以下二百七十九名、缴获小炮五门、机枪六挺、长短枪八十支、掷弹筒一个；无论歼敌和缴获都是空前的。上月北贾战斗、龙头战斗、仙台战斗及本月五日宗贤村战斗，都是以与敌同等力量之兵力及极大代价，而达到成班成排成连的歼灭敌人，战术上亦有飞速提高。如三区以挖心战术毙伤敌人四名，逼退新扎的鳌子岭据点。龙凤联防区发明回马雷，创造铺街战术。南庄敌人距龙凤仅二里，可是看着龙凤不敢进去。特等战斗英雄罗来官并发明空中撞雷，炸伤敌人九名。
