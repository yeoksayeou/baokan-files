　　Overcoming the Paralysis of Saying Without Doing
  　Gao Ping Inspects Drought Resistance and Overcoming Famine
    Truly Achieving: Five Plantings, Ten No's, Five Musts
    [Our Newspaper Taiyue Second Day Electric] Gao Ping recently convened a meeting of cadres from various districts to inspect the work of drought resistance and overcoming famine. It was found that since the deployment at the end of May, nearly a month has passed, but the work is still only at the stage of meetings and verbal calls. Except for a very small number of village cadres who have taken the initiative to actively find ways to complete planting and begin saving, most villages have not taken action. The following problems exist in the thinking of the masses and cadres: (1) Some people say: "Planting early is just planting weeds," and they are afraid to plant early. To this day, some villages have not yet planted. (2) Some cadres think that the disaster is not important, while others feel that there is nothing they can do, so they do not actively organize the masses, forming a laissez-faire situation. (3) It is believed that Gao Ping has ways to engage in sideline occupations, and that drought does not matter, "Moving around for a day, won't you earn two or three dou?" (4) Some people say: "As long as Chairman Mao is here, how can people be allowed to starve to death?" Because handicrafts and sideline businesses earn money easily, waste is still very serious in some places. For example, a paper mill in Yongle Village has more than 70 flashlights, wasting at least 70,000 yuan per month, and they often drink wine and eat meat. Some village offices are also extravagant, using good cigarettes, good wine, and good food to entertain guests and support superiors. Some villages have also left some land unresolved during the land reform, resulting in new wasteland. After discovering these problems, everyone started a discussion and put forward specific solutions. First of all, cadres must be universally mobilized to convene mass meetings to explain that brewing and weaving are not basic methods for preventing disasters. According to past experience, where agriculture is not carried out, there will be more deaths from starvation in famine years. Land is the lifeline, and grain is the foundation. Secondly, the masses must be told that Chairman Mao does not allow people to starve to death, which means that we must prevent drought and prepare for famine. If we do not actively find ways to overcome the disaster years, we will still suffer difficulties. It is necessary to mobilize the masses to recall the suffering of the disasters in 1942 and 1943, arouse the vigilance of the masses, and eradicate extravagance and waste. In terms of leadership methods, it is necessary to promote meritorious competition, commend models, and overcome the problem of stopping work at meetings and general calls. Cadres must personally take action to conduct in-depth inspections. The meeting also called on the masses to achieve "Five Plantings, Ten No's, and Five Musts." The five plantings are: 1. Spot planting: For the land that has not yet been planted, the entire village labor force should be immediately mobilized to carry out spot planting. 2. Replenishing: Where seedlings have not been caught, they must be replanted. 3. Rushing to plant: The new wasteland should be cleaned up and planted as soon as possible. 4. Return planting: This year's wheat production has decreased, and late autumn should be universally replanted to increase production. 5. Vegetable planting: All localities should plant a large number of vegetables such as pumpkins and radishes to supplement the lack of grain. The ten no's are: no inviting guests, no giving gifts, no eating meat, no drinking alcohol, no smoking cigarettes, no using flashlights, no wasting a grain of rice, no making extra bowls of rice, no spending money casually, and no being ashamed of labor. The five musts are: work hard to produce, plan for the long term, save a handful of rice, eat thin porridge, and mix bran with vegetables.

　　克服光说不做麻痹现象
  　高平检查抗旱渡荒
    真正做到：五种、十不、五要
    【本报太岳二日电】高平最近召集各区干部开会检查抗旱渡荒工作，发现自五月底布置以后，至今已近一月，但工作仍只停留在会议和口头号召上，除去极少数村庄干部主动积极想办法，已完成下种和开始节约以外，大部分村子没有行动起来，在群众及干部思想上存在着下面几个问题：（一）有人说：种的早一把草，不敢早种，至今有些村还未下种。（二）有的干部认为灾荒不要紧，有的却感到没办法，都不去积极组织群众，形成自流。（三）认为高平副业有办法，天旱不要紧，“动弹一天，那天不赚他二、三斗”。（四）有人说：“只要毛主席在，还能叫饿死人”？由于手工业副业赚钱容易，有些地方浪费仍很严重，如永乐村一家纸厂，就有七十多个手电筒，每月至少浪费七万元，还经常喝酒吃肉，有些村公所也铺张浪费，拿好纸烟好酒好饭招待客人，支应上级，还有些村在土地改革中遗留一些土地未作处理，以致变成新荒。发现这些问题以后，大家展开讨论，提出具体办法，首先干部要普遍动员起来，召开群众会议，说明酿酒纺织不是防灾的基本办法，根据过去经验，那儿不搞农业，遭了荒年，那儿就饿死人多，地是命根，粮是基本。其次要告诉群众，毛主席不叫饿死人，就是叫咱们防旱备荒，要不自己积极起来想办法，过灾荒年仍是要受困难的。要发动群众回想四二、四三年遭灾荒的苦，引起群众警惕，并根绝铺张浪费，在领导方法上，要发扬立功竞赛，表扬模范，克服把工作停留在会议和一般号召上，干部要亲自动手深入检查。会上并号召群众做到“五种、十不、五要”。五种，即一、点种，还未下种的地，应立即动员全村劳力突击点种，二、补种，没捉住苗的地，一定补种，三、抢种，新荒地要赶紧收拾，下种，四、回种，今年麦子减收，麦收后应普遍回苗，种晚秋，以增加产量，五、种菜，各地都应大量种南瓜、萝卜等蔬菜，以补助粮食的不足。十不是不请客，不送礼，不吃肉，不喝酒，不吃纸烟，不用手电，不浪费一粒米，不多做一碗饭，不随便花钱，不要嫌劳动丢脸。五要是要努力生产，要长期打算，要节省一把米，要吃稀饭，要掺糠吃菜。
