Land Reform Movement in Southern Shanxi
    Li Zhimin
    From late May, counties in Southern Shanxi began to arrange for the land reform movement. Counties in Fen River's southern region started deploying to villages around June 1st. The five counties west of the Taiyue railway, except for Jie County, also began deployment around June 10th. Wenxi, Jishan, and Xinjiang were even earlier than the counties south of the Fen River. The new districts of Xia County and Pinglu, and the southern part of Hejin, which lies south of the Fen River in Jishan were the last to begin. According to current understanding, the development situation is roughly as follows:

    In Wenxi's new district, thirteen villages have initially distributed land, and the movement is spreading to the entire county; Jilu is even faster than Wenxi, and the movement has been launched throughout the county; the southern region of Xinjiang is undergoing re-examination. In Anyi, three villages have distributed land and the key point is being promoted to a comprehensive level. In Ronghe, four villages have distributed land, seven villages are undergoing struggle sessions, and eleven villages are brewing for a ripe harvest. Counties such as Wanquan, Yi Shi, Jishan, Linjin, Yongji, Ruicheng, and Yuxiang have successively begun to break through key points, and are developing rapidly. Due to special circumstances, land reform in Jie County has not actually been carried out. The new districts of Pinglu and Xia County, and the southern part of Hejin which lies south of the Fen River, are still in the initial stages. Judging from the overall situation, the land reform movement in Southern Shanxi will reach a climax by the end of July.

    Each county has gone through a difficult process when starting to break through the movement. First, regarding the deployment of land reform work, each county adopted the spirit of universal publicity and mobilization, and concentrated efforts to break through one point to promote the overall situation in leadership. However, at that time, the masses were beginning to harvest, and most comrades believed that land reform would be difficult to carry out during the summer harvest. At the same time, the armed forces in each county had developed considerably, and the responsible comrades were busy with rectification work, coupled with the summer farming tasks. Therefore, the leadership did not fully pay attention to land reform, lacked a clear division of labor, and handled everything as important. Especially for the work of breaking through key points, they did not personally take action, so the general key point breakthroughs were slow, and the working comrades were depressed and frustrated. Conversely, those who concentrated their thoughts on leadership and personally took action broke through quickly. After the breakthrough, their thinking changed, their emotions rose, and their confidence was high.

    Secondly, starting from the urgent demands of the masses will allow the movement to gradually move forward. Generally, villages started multiple times from the issues of unfair allocation of corvée labor and unfair distribution of grain, opposing "village compilation" and even opposing feudal landlords. In addition, many places adopted the old methods, carrying out individual interviews according to their own subjective plans, small group grievance sessions, and asking the masses for land, which all initially failed. Some cadres even tried to help the masses harvest wheat, but the masses were afraid of standing out and refused. Third, various places have put effort into breaking the masses' thoughts of waiting for change, and generally started from the overall situation, first explaining to the masses the favorable conditions for our preparation for a full-scale counter-offensive, and then analyzing the specific situation in Southern Shanxi and the balance of power. The masses' eyes were widened, and their minds were gradually changing. As an old man in Wenxi said, "Last year, a fat sheep I raised was eaten by wolves, but this year it shouldn't happen." On the contrary, some comrades were confused in their own thinking and unclear, and always said, "Even if we have a seesaw battle, we are not afraid." This always failed to get through to the masses' thinking. Some masses said, "You want us to struggle on one hand, and say there is a seesaw battle on the other hand, isn't that asking us to make trouble?" Fourth, it is very necessary to support and embolden the masses in the new district. The masses have always been under the rule of feudal forces and easily dare not struggle against bullies and landlords. The general masses believe that "the people don't fight with officials, and the poor don't fight with the rich." The masses are afraid of retaliation from the landlords, but they all want revenge and land in their hearts. They say, "As long as the government gives it to everyone, I will want it." We understand this psychology of the masses, and as long as it is generally brewing to maturity, we will detain the object of struggle and mobilize everyone to do it together, and we will quickly break through the difficult barrier of struggle. This approach does not hinder the principle of the masses liberating themselves; the problem is that once the masses dare to stand up, we should boldly let go and let the masses do it.

　　晋南土地改革运动
    李志敏
    从五月下旬，晋南各县即着手布置土地改革运动。汾南各县与六月一日前后布置到村。条西五县除解县外，于六月十日左右亦开始布置下去。闻喜、稷山、新绛、较汾南还早。夏县、平陆的新区，稷山、河津的汾南布置的最晚。根据目前的了解，其发展情况大致如下：
    闻喜新区有十三个村子已初步分田，运动正向全县普及中；稷麓较闻喜还快，运动已在全县范围内开展；新绛汾南地区则正进行复查。安邑有三个村分配了土地，正有基点推向全面。荣河有四个村分配了土地，七个村正在斗争，十一个村酝酿将成熟。万泉、猗氏、稷山、临晋、永济、芮城、虞乡等县均先后开始突破基点，且发展得较快。解县因为情况关系，土地改革实际上没有进行。平陆、夏县的新区，河津的汾南，尚在开始。按整个情况来看，晋南将在七月底土地改革运动走向高潮。
    各县在开始突破运动时，皆经过一段艰巨的过程。首先，关于土地改革工作的布置，在领导上，各县都是采取普遍的宣传动员与集中力量突破一点推动全面的精神布置的；但当时群众正在开始收割，一般同志皆认为土地改革，在夏收期间难以进行，同时各县武装都有相当发展，负责同志忙于整顿工作，又加上夏屯的任务，因此领导上对于土改革地并未全加注意，缺乏明确的分工，什么也重要，什么也管，特别对基点突破工作，没有亲自下手，所以一般的基点突破的较慢，工作同志苦闷烦恼。相反的，凡是领导思想集中，亲自下手，就突破的快，突破后，思想为之一变，情绪高涨，信心很高。
    其次，从群众迫切的要求出发，如果从这开始，运动就逐渐向前发展。一般村子多次从反支差不公派粮不公等问题开始反“编村”以至反封建地主。另外有不少地方采取的老一套方式，按着自己主观计划进行个人访问，小组诉苦，叫群众要地，开始都遭到了失败，甚至有些干部找着给群众收麦，群众怕突出而拒绝。三，各地多在打破群众的变天思想中下了工夫，而一般的多是从全面时局出发，先向群众讲解我们准备全面大反攻的有利条件，然后再分析晋南的具体情况，力量的对比，群众的眼睛放大了，脑筋也在逐渐的转变了。如闻喜一个老汉说：“去年养了一只肥羊叫狼吃了，今年可不至于吧”。相反的，有些同志因为自己思想上糊涂，不明确，总是说：“即使拉锯咱们也不怕。”这始终打不通群众思想，有些群众说：“你们一面要我们斗争，另外说拉锯，那不是要我们闯祸吗？”四，对于给群众撑腰壮胆问题，在新区是非常必要的。群众向来在封建势力的统治下轻易不敢向恶霸、地主斗争，一般的群众认为“民不和官斗，穷不和富斗”，群众害怕地主报复，但心上都想复仇要地，他们说：“只要政府给大家都要，我就要。”我们了解了群众此种心理，只要大体酝酿成熟，便将斗争对象扣起来，发动大家一齐干，便很快突破了斗争的难关。这样作法，并不妨碍群众自己解放自己的原则；问题在于一旦群众敢起来就应大胆的放手，让群众去干。（太岳分社）
