    Widespread Rain in All Counties of Shangdang
    Liberated Peasants Rush to Sow and Weed
    Long-Awaited Rain in Wu'an Area Spurs Intensified Sowing
    [Report from this newspaper in Changzhi] In Changzhi, Lucheng, Huguan, Changzi, Xiangyuan, Gaoping and other places, there was a rainfall on June 22nd, and another thorough rain on July 2nd. The seedlings are growing vigorously, with corn reaching over three feet tall and millet reaching knee depth. The liberated peasants are carefully cultivating the newly recovered land, and are now universally carrying out the third weeding. Some places that had not been sown due to drought are now rushing to sow late crops such as beans.

    [Report from this newspaper] In the Wu'an area, which had been suffering from severe drought for a long time, a welcome rain fell on the afternoon of the 9th. The liberated peasants were overjoyed. County and district government personnel went to the villages overnight to lead the masses in a surprise sowing campaign. Men and women, young and old, in each village participated, and small vendors and merchants also suspended their businesses. The sowing frenzy has entered its most intense stage.
    [Report from this newspaper] In Houchi, Sixth District of Shexian County, there was a two-finger rain on the 2nd of this month. Immediately after the rain, labor hero Liu Shiyan convened a meeting of all mutual aid team leaders, cadres, and activists in the village to discuss how to complete the sowing in a surprise attack. Liu Shiyan said: "I want to complete the sowing quickly, and mobilize women and the elderly." He also put forward slogans such as "Reclaim the land from the fifth month of the lunar calendar, and get a 30% harvest if you see the seedlings." After dinner, each group also deliberated at the people's school. While they were discussing, labor hero Liu Shiyan went out of the courtyard and saw that the moonlight was bright. He ran outside the village to test whether it was feasible to sow and cover the corn. He hurried back to his group and said: "Let's go to the fields tonight to cover the corn." His father, Liu Kezheng, said: "That's right, we can do it by the bright moonlight, and it's cooler at night than during the day." After Liu Kezheng spoke, he immediately shouted loudly up and down the street to Liu Shiyun, Liu Shikai and other three old men to tell the members of his group to go to the fields immediately. The three of them mobilized fifteen people to go to the fields to sow at night. This caused all nine groups in the village to gather together to take advantage of the moonlight to sow in a surprise attack. The third group of fifteen people sowed 19.6 mu in one night, and the whole village sowed a total of 119.6 mu, with a total participation of 90 men and 11 women. The next day, another 111 women were mobilized to participate in the sowing, completing 808.4 mu in one day and one night.
    [Another report] In Longhu and Xiaojing of the Third District, after the two-and-a-half-finger rain on the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, the cadres separately publicized and called on the masses to prepare seeds and farming tools. Li Jingde and Wang Shuzhi, chairpersons of the women's salvation associations in Xiaojing and Longhu, cooperated with the women's minister to mobilize and organize women to help men sow overnight, putting forward ideas such as "equality between men and women, both must labor, those who don't listen to the government will suffer endlessly." For example, Kang Meilin and other fourteen women reported that they had cooked the rice and fed the livestock before the cock crowed, and sent their men to the fields early in the morning. The two villages organized a total of 96 women to participate in the sowing, and in half a day, the two villages had completed all the sowing.
