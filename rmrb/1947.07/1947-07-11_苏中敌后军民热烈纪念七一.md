Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 9th. The military and civilians in the enemy's rear in Central Jiangsu warmly commemorated "July 1st," "July 7th," and the anniversary of the Patriotic Self-Defense War. Mass rallies of thousands of soldiers and civilians were held everywhere, and large-scale operas such as "The White Haired Girl" were performed continuously. The letterpress-printed, folio-sized Jianghai Guide was quickly disseminated to every corner, becoming a symbol of victory. The Central Jiangsu People's Liberation Army held a grand celebration and commendation meeting, inspecting more than 800 combat heroes and people's meritorious servants. Various agencies and troops have universally launched study movements, and everyone is determined to be a soldier with both literacy and military skills. Among the liberated soldiers, a "one-hearted movement" was launched. They used their personal experiences to accuse Chiang Kai-shek of his crimes and swore to be of one heart for the people's cause.
