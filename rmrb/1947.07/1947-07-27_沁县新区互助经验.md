Mutual Aid Experience in Qin County New District

　　In the process of organizing in the new district of Qin County, it can be roughly divided into three stages: The first stage was after more than 3,000 young people from the county joined the army in early February, the number of military families and long-term conscripted laborers' families in the county increased sharply. In addition, when the puppet army leader Duan Bingchang withdrew from Qin County, he forcibly took away more than 10,000 young people, creating a great difficulty in labor and animal power. This was a major problem in production. The leadership promptly put forward the方針 and slogan of "organizing to overcome difficulties". However, the method of organizing was not resolved. Therefore, the districts and villages held mass meetings specifically to solve the issue of preferential treatment for military families and substitute farming. From top to bottom, they announced "organizing". Without first organizing the masses to醞釀 and take the path of mass voluntarism, and without specifically studying organizational methods, the entire village's men and women, full and semi-labor, were 100% organized in one night and one meeting. Some were compiled by moving household registration books, some were compiled according to neighborhoods, and some were assigned by cadres. The mutual aid brigade leaders, squad leaders, and team leaders were also produced from top to bottom. Afterwards, when asked what the mutual aid group did, everyone said, "It's for the Eighth Route Army's official business." After being compiled in this way, of course, there were many problems. For example, when the mutual aid group went to the fields, they would not move on one piece of land, or you would come and I would go, and it would take half a day to gather, or today it was you who was sick or he who made excuses that "there are things at home that I can't take care of," and so on. Another reason for this administratively ordered organization was: (1) Under the influence of slogans such as "Farmers all over the world are one family," "Turning over and helping each other becomes a whole," "Participating in the Farmers' Association is glorious, it's a shame if you can't join" in the land reform, people who didn't participate were afraid of being isolated; (2) Due to the large-scale participation in the army and war, the substitute farming problem for military families and conscripted laborers' families had to be solved immediately, so it was necessary to organize to give preferential treatment to resistance and substitute farming; (3) In the land reform, the prestige of the Communist Party, the government, and the Farmers' Association was greatly enhanced, and as long as the higher authorities issued a call, thousands of farmers would support it, and this temporary enthusiasm dominated their participation in mutual aid.

　　Around mid-April, the county, districts, and villages held larger-scale meetings to make a comprehensive and in-depth mobilization for the production movement. The policy issues regarding the development of production were also announced: "Every village organizes mutual aid, everyone participates in labor," "What we are fighting against is feudal exploitation, what we are developing is labor to get rich, and what we are supporting is mutual cooperation," "Cadres personally take action, organize mutual aid, participate in production, and establish a labor concept," and so on. At the same time, at the mass meetings in each village, the village cadres also reviewed the mutual aid groups that had been compiled in the previous stage, declaring their cancellation and reorganization, adhering to the principles of free combination, from small to large, organizing the masses to酝釀 ideologically. In this way, ideological problems such as fear of getting rich, fear of responsibility, fear of suffering losses, and fear of not being free were gradually exposed. After organized酝釀 and mobilization to clear up thinking, cadres took the lead in commending activists, formulating plans to get rich, and making achievements. After summarizing and promoting the expansion of mutual aid organizations, the方針 of equal value exchange and close integration of agriculture and sideline occupations was put forward, and by launching a meritorious service competition to strive for models, the labor mutual aid movement was transformed. At the same time, 2,000 activists and heroic models such as Li Deyuan, Wang Yuhe, Zhou Yueying, Li Guixiu, Tian Shufan, Wang Laijin, and Wu Xialian were discovered, thus overcoming the major difficulty of labor shortage in spring plowing and production, ensuring that all the land was sown, and the labor mutual aid movement developed vigorously. Our experience in the development and consolidation of this labor mutual aid is: (1) The方針 of organizing to overcome difficulties is correct. However, if we do not study the methods to realize the方針, we will be biased and take detours. (2) Organizing is a process of ideological awareness of the masses. Therefore, we must resolutely clear up thinking, grasp the principle of voluntary combination, actively organize mobilization, and develop from small to large with cadres and heroes taking the lead; (3) The combination of agriculture and sideline occupations, the combination of full and semi-labor, the combination of production and participation in war, and adhering to equal value exchange are the basic keys to consolidating and developing the labor mutual aid movement; (4) Formulating plans for mutual aid groups, regularly summarizing achievements, promoting typical models, carrying out meritorious service competitions, and implementing democratic leadership to stimulate enthusiasm for the great production movement are important leadership methods for consolidating and improving labor mutual aid groups; (5) Establishing a leadership core that closely combines cadres and labor heroes to strengthen the leadership of the labor mutual aid movement.

　　In early June, districts held summary meetings to commend models and congratulate achievements in spring plowing. At this meeting, specific methods for reviewing land measurement and combining production were arranged. In the labor mutual aid groups, since spring plowing and sowing had passed and weeding had arrived, the organizational form of labor mutual aid also changed from being centered on cattle to being centered on households. A large number of semi-laborers were organized to go to the fields to weed, replacing the spring plowing and sowing form centered on cattle and combining full and semi-labor. Our experience in this transition is: (1) The completion of spring plowing and sowing and the beginning of summer harvest are the keys to the continuation and collapse of labor mutual aid development, and the leadership must grasp and pay attention to it well; (2) In the link of labor mutual aid after sowing is completed and the agricultural season changes, it is necessary to handle the issue of surplus labor well. The best way is to organize a close combination of agriculture and sideline occupations to solve equal value exchange and ensure that everyone benefits; (3) The common point in these two transitions is to organize women, children, old men, and semi-laborers to go to the fields to maximize the role of labor, so as to free up full male laborers for sideline production; (4) The decentralization and concentration of organizational forms and the issue of centering on cattle and households are all based on the needs of the agricultural production season.

　　The above is some basic experience and lessons learned by the leadership in Qin County during spring plowing. In order to further improve labor mutual aid, the following points should be noted at present: The agricultural season is at the stage of finishing wheat harvesting and starting summer cultivation. The seedlings are in urgent need of weeding, and the late autumn crops are in urgent need of sowing. Based on the above situation: (1) Seize the agricultural season to organize a concentrated summer cultivation centered on cattle; (2) Organize as many full laborers as possible to go to the fields to weed; (3) Organize the remaining labor force to eliminate the wasteland and plant late autumn crops (buckwheat, small black beans, vegetables, etc.). In the above work, consolidate and continuously develop the labor mutual aid meritorious service movement.

　　沁县新区互助经验
    沁县新区在组织起来的过程中，大体可分为三个阶段：第一阶段是二月初全县三千多青年参军后，全县军属与长期参战民夫家属骤增，又加上伪军头子段炳昌在沁县撤退时，强迫带走万余青年，形成劳力畜力的大困难，这是生产上的大问题，领导上及时提出了“组织起来克服困难”的方针与口号，但是没有解决组织起来的方法，因此各区村都召开民众大会，专门来解决优军代耕问题，自上而下的宣布“组织起来”，事先既不组织群众酝酿走群众自觉自愿之路，又没具体研究组织方法，一个黑夜一个会议就把全村男女全半劳动百分之百的组织起来了，有搬开户口册子编的，有按闾邻编的，还有的是干部指定分拨插开的，各互助大队长分队长小组长，也都是自上而下产生出来。事后问群众说：“互助组是干甚的？”大家说是：“八路军的公事”。经这样编制起来后，当然毛病很多，例如互助组上地，到了一块不动弹，或你来我去，半天集合不起，或今天不是你病就是他借故“家里有事顾不上”等等。而这种行政命令组织起来的另一原因，即是：（一）由于土地改革中的“天下农民是一家”，“翻身互助成一疙瘩”，“参加农会是光荣，入不了农会真丢人”等口号影响下，不参加的人怕孤立起来；（二）由于大规模的参军、参战后，军属与参战民夫家属的代耕问题必须马上解决，因而要组织起来优抗、代耕；（三）在土地改革中，共产党、政府、农会的威信大大提高，只要上边发个号召，千万农民无不拥护，这种一时热情支配着他参加了互助。
    四月中旬前后，县区村都开了规模较大的会议，把生产运动作了全面而深入的大动员，关于发展生产政策问题，也宣布了：“村村组织互助，人人参加劳动”，“不割韭菜，斗的是封建剥削，发展的是劳动发家，扶植的是互助合作”、“干部亲自动手，组织互助，参加生产，树立劳动观念”等口号，同时在各村群众大会上，村干部把前一段编起的互助组也作了检讨，声明取消重新组织，坚持自由结合，由小而大的原则，组织群众思想酝酿，这样就逐渐暴露了怕发财、怕负责、怕吃亏、怕不自由等思想问题，经过有组织的酝酿动员打通思想，干部带头表扬积极分子、订发家计划做出成绩后，总结推广扩大互助组织，紧接着提出了等价交换、农副业密切结合的方针，并以展开立功竞赛争取模范的方法，使劳动互助运动从而获得改造，同时又发现了李德元、王雨和、周月英、李桂秀、田树藩、王来金、武夏莲等两千位积极分子和英雄模范人物，从而克服了春耕生产中劳动缺乏的大困难，保证了所有的土地全部下种，劳动互助运动蓬勃的发展起来了。在这段劳动互助的发展与巩固中，我们的经验是：（一）组织起来克服困难的方针是正确的。但如不研究实现方针的方法，就会产生偏向走弯路。（二）组织起来是群众思想自觉的过程，因之我们必须坚决打通思想，掌握自愿结合的原则，积极的组织动员，以干部英雄带头由小而大的发展；（三）农副业结合，全半劳力结合，生产参战结合，坚持等价交换是巩固与发展劳动互助运动的基本关键；（四）组织互助组订定计划，定期总结成绩，发扬典型模范，开展立功竞赛，实行民主领导，掀起大生产运动热情是巩固与提高劳动互助组的重要领导方法；（五）树立干部与劳英密切结合的领导核心，加强劳动互助运动的领导。
    六月初，各区召开总结春耕表模贺功大会。在这个大会上，布置了复查丈地结合生产具体作法，而在劳动互助组上，由于春耕下种已经过去，拔苗锄草已经到来，因此劳动互助组织形式也随之由以牛为中心转变为以户为中心，组织了大批半劳力上地拔苗锄草的形式，代替了以牛为中心全半劳力结合的春耕下种形式。在这个转变中，我们的经验是：（一）春耕下种完毕与夏收开始，是劳力互助发展的持续与垮台的关键，领导必须很好掌握与注意。（二）劳动互助在下种完毕，农业季节转变的环节中，要很好的处理余工问题。其最好办法，是组织农副业密切结合，解决等价交换，做到人人有利；（三）在这两个转变中的共同点，是组织妇女儿童老汉半劳力上地，尽量发挥劳力的作用，如此用以腾出男全劳力进行副业生产；（四）组织形式的分散与集中以牛与户为中心的问题，都是根据农业生产季节的需要而转变的。
    以上就是沁县春耕中领导的一些基本经验与教训，为使劳动互助进一步提高，目前应注意以下几点：农业季节正处在割完麦子开始夏垡，苗子已急须要锄搂，刚刚入伏晚秋作物急须下种。基于如上情况：（一）抓紧农业季节组织以牛为中心突击夏垡；（二）尽量组织全劳力上地、戬苗；（三）组织剩余劳力，消灭熟荒，种植晚秋作物（荞麦小黑豆蔬菜等）在如上的工作中，把劳动互助立功运动巩固而持续的发展下去。
