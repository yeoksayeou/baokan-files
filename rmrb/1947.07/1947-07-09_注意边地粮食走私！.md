　　Beware of Grain Smuggling on the Border!
　　Comrade Editor:
　　Since June, grain prices in the enemy-controlled areas have skyrocketed. In Jixian County, in June, the enemy troops stopped receiving supplies in kind and were issued legal tender, directing them to抢购grain on the market. The grain in the market was not enough to sell and was all seized by the enemy troops. Because their territory has shrunk, the enemy is very paniced about grain. South of the Wei River, the enemy even uses armed protection for smuggling. Due to the need for essential goods, many people are even exchanging wheat for salt. It is hoped that this situation will attract attention from all regions, calling on domestic public and private shops to bring salt and other necessities to protect grain and benefit the people's livelihood.

　　注意边地粮食走私！
    编辑同志：
    六月份以来，顽区粮价飞涨，汲县六月份停止顽军实物供给，发给法币，指使顽军在市场抢购粮食，市上粮食不够卖，都被顽军抢走。敌人因地区缩小粮食十分恐慌，在卫河以南，敌人甚至用武装保护走私。群众因必需品之需要，竟有不少以麦换盐者。此种情况希望引起各地注意，号召内地公私商店，携带食盐必需品等前往，以便保卫粮食，并利民生。
