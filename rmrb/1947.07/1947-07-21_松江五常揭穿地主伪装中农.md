Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 18th: The Wuchang County in Songjiang Province has been exposing landlords disguised as middle peasants, deepening land reform. Han Yonggui, a landlord who operated in Nanjiatun in the county, feigned a family division, dividing his land into multiple shares, each only three or four *qing* (one *qing* equals ten *mu*). He then put on the guise of a middle peasant, shouting to the masses: "Don't infringe upon the interests of 'middle peasants'!" After the land reform was implemented in the Seventh District, a landlord surnamed Wang still had a lot of grain, livestock, and property left. However, he mobilized his whole family to beg for food from door to door, pretending to be poor. Deceived by the landlords' disguises, some cadres couldn't distinguish truth from falsehood and emphasized giving them consideration, which damaged the interests of the masses. For example, a large landlord in Democratic Village who owned more than two hundred *qing* was given consideration after the struggle last year, and his floating assets and livestock were returned to him. This time, the leadership, targeting the cadres' erroneous thinking, conducted education and emphasized letting go and mobilizing the masses. Immediately, a wave of exposing landlords' disguises was set off in various villages. In Baoshan Village alone, twenty-six disguised landlords were exposed within twenty days.

　　松江五常揭穿地主伪装中农
    【新华社东北十八日电】松江省五常县揭穿地主伪装中农，使土地改革深入发展。该县难家屯经营地主韩永贵，假分家，将土地分成多股，每股只三、四垧（每垧十亩），然后披上中农伪装，向群众大喊：不许侵犯“中农”利益。七区实行土地改革后地主王某还剩下很多粮食、牲口及财物，他却发动全家挨户讨饭吃装穷。在地主伪装欺骗下，部分干部，不辨真假，强调照顾，使群众利益受到损失。如民主村一个拥有二百多垧的大地主，去年斗争过后强调照顾，把浮产牲畜退还。此次领导上针对干部错误思想，进行教育，强调放手发动群众后，各屯即掀起揭破地主伪装热潮，仅宝山一村二十天内，即揭穿了二十六家伪装地主。
