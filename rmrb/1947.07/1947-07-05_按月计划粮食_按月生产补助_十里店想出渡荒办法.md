　　Planning Grain by the Month, Production Subsidies by the Month
  　Shili Village Devises a Way to Survive the Famine
    [Our Newspaper, Wu'an News] The cadres of the Ninth District's Shili Village recently convened a meeting of the masses to discuss how to survive the famine. It was discovered that the masses had two concerns: those with more grain worried that their savings would be depleted by those without grain, and were therefore unwilling to conserve. The other concern was: if it doesn't rain, saving alone won't work, and they couldn't think of a way to prepare for the famine. At the meeting, everyone was first guided to recall the life in the famine years, clarifying the idea that "if we don't start preparing for the famine now, it will be terrible in the future." In order to eliminate the concerns of those with more grain, the village chief officially announced: "Whoever produces and saves grain, it is theirs, and there will be no communal eating. Those who do not produce and save now deserve to starve to death in the future." How to survive the famine? In addition to stipulating that no white flour should be eaten, and saving two liang of millet and two liang of corn per day, and not smoking paper cigarettes, the masses created a method of "planning grain by the month and subsidizing production by the month." Each household makes a plan, stating how much grain they currently have, and calculating that each person needs half a jin of millet per day, planning to survive the famine for a year. They calculate how much grain the whole family needs each month, divide the existing grain into twelve portions, and how much is still needed. In addition to fighting drought and rushing to plant, men transport goods and women weave to supplement the supply. Comrade Wang Xitang, the village chief, said: "Everyone can try dividing the grain into twelve months. Whoever can survive one month will not starve to death for a year. Now the masses in Shili Village feel that they have found a way to fight drought and survive the famine, and they are making plans one after another. For example, Fu Pijiang's family of three in the seventh mutual aid group has 300 jin of grain calculated as millet. Calculating half a jin of rice per person per day, they need 45 jin per month. The existing grain is only enough to eat for seven months. Now they must step up drought resistance and production, engage in side businesses, and strive to earn the equivalent of five months of grain in order to avoid starvation. The rest of the families, such as Fu Shun's family, have also calculated the amount of grain per person, and have come up with remedies. Through household planning, the masses have confidence in fighting drought and surviving the famine, and they all say: "As long as we work hard, we will not starve to death."

　　按月计划粮食　按月生产补助
  　十里店想出渡荒办法
    【本报武安讯】九区十里店最近由区村干部召集群众开会，讨论如何渡过灾荒，发现群众思想中有二种顾虑：圪塔户认为自己节省的粮食，将来怕吃不完，谁没粮食谁就来吃，因此不愿节省。另一种思想是：天不下雨只靠节省也不行，想不出备荒办法。在会议上首先引导大家回忆灾荒年的生活，明确“现在不着手备荒将来不得了”的思想。为了消除圪塔户的顾虑，村长正式宣布：“谁生产节约的粮食是谁的，决不伙吃，现在不生产节约的人，将来饿死也活该。”如何渡荒呢？除规定不吃白面，每日节省二两小米二两玉茭，不吸纸烟等项外，群众创造了：“按月计划粮食，按月生产补助”的办法，每户都订计划，现存粮食多少，每人每日以半斤小米计算，计划渡荒一年，每月全家需要粮食多少，存粮分为十二份，尚差多少，除抗旱抢种外，男运输女纺织来补助。村长王西堂同志说：“大家可以把粮食按十二个月分开试一下，谁能渡过一个月，谁就一年也饿不死。现在十里店群众都认为抗旱渡荒摸着了门路，纷纷订计划。例如第七互助组富丕姜家有三口人，现存粮食折米三百斤，每人每日以半斤米计算，每月需要四十五斤，存粮只够吃七个月，现在必须加紧抗旱生产捣副业，争取收赚到五个月粮食，才能不饿死。其余富顺家等都按粮按人计算过了，并都想出了补救办法。通过按户计划，群众对抗旱渡荒有了胜利信心，都说：“只要咱们加油干，是饿不死的”。
