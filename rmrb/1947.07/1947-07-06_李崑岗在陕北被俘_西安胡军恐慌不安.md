Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 4th: According to people from Xi'an, the news of Li Kun'gang's capture in Panlong, northern Shaanxi, had a chilling effect on Hu's military officers, and their morale plummeted. Hu Zongnan had planned to transfer over a thousand officers from the Officers' Training Corps to replenish his casualties, but the officers were mostly unwilling to go to their deaths in northern Shaanxi again; everyone called the appointment orders "death warrants" and evaded and delayed, obstructing Hu Zongnan's plan. On May 6th, the People's Liberation Army recovered Yao County, but only after the People's Liberation Army voluntarily withdrew from the city did the Xi'an newspapers belatedly publish news of the "National Army's recovery of Yao County." However, the people of Xi'an had already been spreading rumors: "The Eighth Route Army has reached Yao County!" "The commissioner is 'missing'" (Yao County Commissioner Yan Chongshi has been captured by us), "The railway is cut off..." At that time, Chiang's troops in Xi'an were extremely panic-stricken, and they transferred students from the Chiang Kai-shek Central Military Academy's Seventh Branch to guard the city, and officers from the Officers' Training Corps were also on alert in the streets. People from Sanyuan and Yao County were not allowed to enter the city. After Hu's troops were trapped in northern Shaanxi, the people near Xi'an were pestered by "victory donations" and "comfort fees." Hu Zongnan also ordered all noodle shops to make flatbreads for Hu's troops, which were transported to northern Shaanxi by plane. The people of Xi'an immediately discussed, "They must be trapped." Many people mixed bran into the flour, and most of the flatbreads quickly spoiled. Hu's military logistics personnel were greatly troubled by the supply work, and Zhou Shiman, director of Hu's Fifth Supply Zone, was forced to resign on May 20th.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 3rd: A visitor from Xi'an said that after Hu Zongnan suffered losses and occupied the empty city of Yan'an, he painstakingly produced a so-called "recovery of Yan'an" film, preparing to screen it widely in the Northwest to "publicize the 'victory' of the 'National Army'." However, when this film was publicly screened for the first time at the Afang Palace Cinema in Xi'an, the audience whispered to each other and discussed it; everyone was particularly interested in Mao Zedong's life, because the Kuomintang had vigorously promoted how extravagant he was, but what appeared on the screen, such as Mao Zedong's office, was even simpler than ordinary people. This incident embarrassed the Kuomintang authorities very much, and they immediately stopped the screening. Thus, the so-called "recovery of Yan'an" only showed its face to the audience once, and then disappeared without a trace.

　　李崑岗在陕北被俘
  　西安胡军恐慌不安
    【新华社西北四日电】据西安来人谈：李崑岗在陕北蟠龙被俘消息，对胡军军官们有如一瓢冷水浇头，情绪大落。胡宗南曾计划由军官总队调集千余名军官补充其伤亡，但军官们多不愿再往陕北送死；大家把委任令叫做“阎王令”，纷纷推宕拖延，致胡宗南的计划受阻。五月六日解放军收复耀县，但至解放军主动撤离该城后西安各报始赶放马后炮，刊登出“国军收复耀县”新闻，可是西安人民早已传说纷纷：“八路军已到了耀县呀！”“专员‘失踪’了”（耀县专员阎崇师已为我俘获），“铁路切断了……”当时西安蒋军极为恐慌，把蒋记中央军校七分校学生调来守城，军官总队军官也在街头警戒。三原、耀县的人一律不能入城。胡军被困陷陕北后，西安附近人民就被“胜利捐”“慰劳费”纠缠不清。胡宗南并下令所有面食铺给胡军烙饼子，用飞机运陕北。西安人民即议论着“这一定是把狗日的困住了。”很多人在面里掺了麸子，饼子很快就大部腐坏。胡军后勤人员对补给工作大感头疼，胡军第五补给区主任周士曼，已于五月二十日被迫辞职。
    【新华社西北三日电】西安来客谈：胡宗南损兵折将侵占延安空城后，煞费苦心摄制了一套所谓“光复延安”的影片，准备在西北各地普遍放映，以“宣扬‘国军’的‘胜利’。”但这张影片在西安阿房宫电影院第一次公开放映时，观众交头接耳，议论纷纷；大家对毛泽东的生活尤感兴趣，因国民党曾大肆宣传如何奢华，而银幕上所现出的如毛泽东的办公室，却较常人尤为简朴。此事使国民党当局非常狼狈，立即停演。于是所谓“光复延安”，只和观众们照了一面，从此无声无息。
