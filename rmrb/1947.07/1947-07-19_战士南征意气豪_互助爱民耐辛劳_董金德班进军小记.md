    Soldiers March South with High Spirits:
    Mutual Aid, Love for the People, and Endurance of Hardship
    A Brief Account of the Dong Jinde Squad's Advance

            I. The Machine Gun is Almost Torn Apart

    The troops were marching under the hot sun, and everyone was getting tired. One soldier in the machine gun squad was lagging behind. Squad leader Dong Jinde and soldier Wang Zhong ran up and tried to take the machine gun. The big fellow carrying the machine gun was embarrassed and wouldn't let go. The three of them started tugging at it, each saying, "Let go, let me carry it, I'm not tired." The happy Ninth Squad leader Zhang Er said, "Everyone come and see, the machine gun is almost torn apart."

            II. Even Those with Blisters Keep Up

    During the march, four comrades in the whole squad had blisters on their feet, but no one fell behind. They encouraged each other with the motto, "We made the plan ourselves, we can't fall behind." Song Xiaosan had blisters on his feet that were bigger than copper coins. Not only did he not let others carry his things, but he sometimes helped the cooks carry the oil and salt, and carried bedrolls for others. Chen Laohei's right foot was swollen like a leavened bun, and he also had a blister on his left foot. But he didn't say a word about not being able to walk. He also actively offered to carry flour for others in the squad. When people wouldn't let him, he said, "Carrying flour is for my own food, who should carry it if I don't?"

            III. The Pot with Flour Paste

    They were stationed in × Village and cooked at a local villager's house. After they finished eating, they washed the pot very clean and poured in cold water. They discovered that the pot was leaking and thought they had broken it, so they wanted to pay for it. The villager said, "Comrades, don't pay. This pot was already broken, and I have to use flour paste every time I cook." Before leaving, Comrade Dong Jinde apologized to the villager many times, making the villager so happy that his mouth couldn't close.

    战士南征意气豪
    互助爱民耐辛劳
    董金德班进军小记
            一、机枪快要夺烂了
    部队在炎热的阳光下行军，人们都走得有些疲倦。机枪班有一个战士走得不起劲，班长董金德和战士王忠跑上前去就夺机枪，那个背机枪的大个子很不好意思的拿着机枪不放。三人互夺起来，都说：“你放开手吧，让我来扛，我不累。”高兴的九班长张二说：“大家来看机枪快要夺烂了。”
            二、打泡的也跟上来了
    全班在行军中有四个同志脚上打了泡，可是没有一个人掉队。他们以“计划是自己订的，可不能掉队”来互相鼓励。宋小三脚上的泡比铜子还大，他不仅不让别人背东西，有时还帮助火房担油盐担子，给别人背被包。陈老黑右脚肿的象个发面馍，左脚上也打了个泡。但他没说过半句走不动的话。并且在班里还积极替人扛面，人家不让他扛，他说：“扛面是为了自己吃，自己不扛叫谁扛？”
            三、面糊的锅
    他们住在×村到一家老乡家做饭，吃完饭将锅洗的很干净，倒上凉水。他们发现锅漏了，以为是自己用坏的就要赔钱。老乡说：“同志，可不要赔钱，这锅原来就是个坏的，俺每天做饭还要用面糊一次。临出门时董金德同志向老乡说了好多道歉话，喜的老乡嘴都合不拢。
