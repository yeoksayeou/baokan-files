Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 22nd. The Taizhou local armed forces in Suzhong annihilated one and a half companies of Chiang's puppet troops in one battle within the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" zone, with only one casualty and one wounded on our side. This set an example of a county-level armed force annihilating a large number of enemies at the smallest cost (one to one hundred). On the 12th of this month, two battalions of the 304th Regiment of the Fourth Division of the Chiang Army and two mobile security brigades from Taixing, totaling more than 2,000 men, "encircled and suppressed" the northern side of the Ru (Gao) - Huang (Qiao) line. The Taizhou local armed forces skillfully penetrated Jinjiazhuang, a place full of strongholds on the border of Taizhou and Taixing, extinguished one route of the invading army, captured more than 120 people including the captain of the Taixing County Security Mobile Brigade of the Chiang regime, and killed or wounded more than 60 people including the liaison officer of the 304th Regiment, seizing nine light machine guns and more than 100 rifles.
