Now that a merit campaign is underway in the rear, we have compiled the merit experience of the front-line troops, hoping to give our rear leadership comrades some inspiration. Although the conditions at the front and rear are different, some basic experiences can be used for reference.

Since the launch of the merit campaign in our front-line troops, the troops' appearance has been renewed, their combat effectiveness has been unprecedentedly improved, and all kinds of work have been advanced. In this vigorous merit campaign, a lot of experience has been gained, the most important of which are the following:

(1) On the Issue of Ideological Leadership of the Merit Campaign

I. The merit campaign is an ideological and conscious movement that meets the requirements of the masses. Therefore, we must strengthen the ideological leadership of the merit campaign. Only when the leadership's thinking is combined with the requirements of the masses, break through all ideological obstacles, and gradually improve the understanding of the masses can the merit campaign be carried out comprehensively and deeply. The masses are enthusiastic and serious about the merit campaign. After the call was issued, all troops successively set off a heat of killing the enemy and earning merits. Many comrades expressed their determination to earn merits for the people, announced their plans to kill the enemy and earn merits, and many heroic figures emerged. These phenomena reflect the emotions of the masses and prove that the proposal of the merit campaign is in line with the ideological reality of the masses. Whether the leading comrades at all levels can deeply understand the emotions of the masses and solve the specific problems reflected by the masses in a timely manner is of decisive significance for the development of the merit campaign in their units.

II. Ideological education is the foundation of the merit campaign. Clear leadership thinking and correct grasp of the development of the movement are the main keys to the development of the movement. At the beginning of the merit campaign, each unit adopted different steps of ideological mobilization according to the actual situation of the troops at that time. Some transitioned to the merit campaign after the grievance and revenge movement, some transitioned to the merit campaign after the education of the current situation and future prospects, and some launched the merit campaign through a killing competition, and then carried out ideological education. Some repeatedly explained the significance of the merit campaign through various mobilization meetings, thus setting off a heat of merit. Experience has proved that it is more solid in ideology to transition to the merit campaign after the grievance movement to inspire their class consciousness and set off the determination to take revenge. However, it cannot be said with certainty that it is impossible to do without the grievance movement. The central issue lies in the clear leadership thinking and the correct grasp of the development of the movement. The development of the merit campaign is the most practical and effective method to promote new heroism, promote all work, and complete combat missions. It is a new development of political work in the self-defense war. Whoever's thinking is not clear about this point and vulgarizes it as a "new trick," a "shock work," or a "general call" and does not mobilize military and political cadres to work together, and does not correctly grasp the development of the merit campaign, solve specific problems in a timely manner, and summarize in a timely manner, then they cannot carry out the merit campaign.

III. Break through ideological obstacles, eliminate dead corners, expand the scope of merit, and involve all personnel. In the merit campaign, if the emphasis is simply on killing the enemy and earning merits, ideological obstacles will inevitably arise, and "dead corners" of the movement will inevitably arise. If ideological obstacles cannot be broken, all personnel cannot be involved in the wave of the merit campaign. Experience has proved that the main aspect of ideological obstacles is the ideological problem of cadres. Some cadres believe that "the merit campaign is to mobilize soldiers"; some military cadres believe that "the merit campaign is the matter of political workers" and put themselves outside the circle. The cadres of the organs believe that "if you don't fight, you can't earn merits," or they hold a negative attitude of "not seeking merit, but seeking no fault." Some raised questions such as "Can organ cadres earn merits?" "How to earn merits?" Overcoming the above ideological obstacles requires internal party discussions, and mobilizing activists to first express their attitudes in the military conference and take the lead, carrying out a grand mobilization, and putting forward slogans such as "As long as there is determination, everyone can earn merits," to induce everyone to discuss, and to influence everyone with the model actions of leading cadres, so as to set off a heat of merit.

Among the soldiers, the emphasis was initially placed on seizing guns and capturing prisoners. This also caused a misunderstanding among the soldiers. Many special soldiers believed that "we can't earn merits," but this ideological obstacle was quickly solved by the masses themselves. For example, a machine gun squad proposed "seeing blood when the gun is fired" as the standard for the machine gun squad to earn merits. Other cooks, telephone operators, barbers, etc. also set their own merit standards and plans. In short, the ideological obstacles generated among the masses should be mobilized to guide the masses to solve them themselves. This is the basic method to break through ideological obstacles and eliminate "dead corners." However, ideological obstacles and "dead corners" will continue to occur in the development of the movement, and the leadership must deeply understand the ideological situation of the masses, repeatedly launch discussions, carry out mobilization and explanation work, eliminate any doubts and negative emotions of the masses, and improve the understanding of the masses.

IV. Commend models, cultivate models, and establish banners to promote the movement forward. In the merit campaign, individual and collective model examples have emerged in various units. The leadership should be good at commending these models, calling on everyone to learn from them, and rewarding models in various personnel to influence the whole. However, the models that emerge in the merit campaign are often not comprehensive and not good in all aspects, and require the help and cultivation of the leadership. If there are models but no conscious cultivation and improvement, they will often die out spontaneously.

(2) Generally formulating a merit plan is the beginning of the merit campaign and an effective step in creating a mass movement.

Formulating a plan is to express the determination to earn merits and to determine the goal of efforts. After conducting ideological mobilization, all units have issued calls for everyone to formulate a merit plan. Some leading cadres of the troops personally took the lead in formulating their own plans to kill the enemy and earn merits, in order to influence the entire troops, especially the cadres. However, the merit plan must proceed from reality and must be combined with the actual situation of their own positions. Many comrades' plans are only based on temporary enthusiasm and are often too high to be completed, and they will lose confidence. This needs to be grasped by the leadership. Therefore, after everyone has formulated a plan, they must also be mobilized to review the plan. The merit plan must also be gradually revised and improved according to the changes in the situation of the troops, and new content must be added, especially to combine with the weaknesses of the troops. For example, a cadre of a unit added a "mastering the troops" item in the merit plan after a battle, and the troops were orderly in another battle. This is a very good experience.

At present, most of the merit plans are individual. It should also be raised to the collective level and promote mutual assistance in earning merits. However, if the individual merit is not launched and the collective is emphasized too early, it will often fall through.

(3) Commendation, comparison, evaluation, and recording of merit must trust the masses and follow the mass line.

The merit campaign is a mass movement, and the mass-based commendation, comparison, evaluation, and recording of merit must be carried out from the bottom up, so that the masses can be convinced. Any phenomenon of leadership monopolizing must be overcome.

Commendation is the most important work, but when the commendation is launched at the beginning, everyone is polite to each other and embarrassed to speak. When a certain unit started the commendation, this phenomenon occurred. Later, a soldier told about his experience of capturing a gun and talked about his merits, and also criticized others (including opinions on the command), and the leadership used this example to induce everyone, and as a result, the commendation was launched. This method of commending and talking about experience is very good. After the commendation, it is followed by a comparison of merits, "See who has the greater merit? Who should be given merit?" Let everyone discuss (argue), and finally a correct conclusion can be reached. (The above methods of commending and comparing merits can also be used among cadres.) In the evaluation of merits, some units only pay attention to the number of guns seized or generally propose that being injured is a merit. Therefore, the soldiers have opinions and propose: "The guns seized not in the battle, but in the search, cannot be given merit!" "I rushed to the front without being injured, and he was injured in the back because of shrinking back, and he cannot be given merit!"... These opinions are correct. Therefore, the evaluation of merit must also be based on the role in the battle, the specific circumstances at the time, and its usual performance, but the usual performance is not the main thing. If the usual performance is not good, but the performance in the battle is brave and there is a seizure, it should also be given merit. At this time, some soldiers will disagree with giving him merit, and the leadership needs to grasp it.

The standards and methods for evaluating and recording merits have not been finally resolved, and in fact it is difficult to formulate unified standards and methods. But it is certain that the evaluation of merit is accurate and the recording of merit will not deviate, and the masses will be able to admire the meritorious persons. The general methods of evaluating merit are: 1. Stipulate conditions, such as breaking through the front line, the amount of seizure, what new creations... etc. as the standards for evaluating the size of the merits; 2. Record merits by points. For example, completing the task (training, marching, fighting) is 60 points, battlefield and mass discipline are 10 points each, and mutual assistance is 20 points. 60 points is qualified and counts as a great merit. 3. The mass meeting formulates the merits based on specific materials. 4. Those with special merits are recorded as special merits.

Among these methods of evaluating merit, the first one limits the conditions and has little flexibility. It often focuses on one aspect and ignores the strengths or weaknesses of the other aspects of a comrade, and it is not easy to consolidate. Although the third one has great democracy, it is not accurate, and the result of development will flow into carelessness and emotional use. The second method has a wider scope and is more perfect. It can flexibly change different tasks, such as combat taking combat achievements as the main (60 points), training taking learning as the main (60 points), and then the masses evaluate according to the quality of completing the task. The general deviation can be reduced.

There are basically two methods of recording merit: 1. Record at any time, the squad leader reports to the merit committee every day, or the squad selects a merit recorder and a merit group leader to register the materials every day. 2. After the task is completed, the meetings at all levels summarize, evaluate and record merit. Both methods have advantages.

The issue of merits and demerits: Some adopt the method of "merits can offset sins, and demerits must reduce merits." After research, it is believed that merits and demerits should not be offset. Merits are merits, and demerits are demerits. Merits can exempt from demerits, and demerits cannot reduce merits. If merits and demerits occur at the same time, they should be registered at the same time. Merits are recorded as merits, and demerits are recorded as demerits. The regimental battalion is recorded by the district (brigade), and the company platoon is recorded by the regiment.

(4) Reporting Merit, Congratulating Merit

Reporting merit and congratulating merit are the most important part of the merit campaign, because it itself has a strong form of honor, which is the most concerned by the majority of soldiers and masses. If this work is done well, it will play a great role in promoting the entire movement, but it is often neglected due to the tense combat environment.

"Reporting merit" is the most glorious, which has become a universal psychology. Therefore, the merit committees at all levels should designate special merit reporters to report externally. Their tasks are: (1) Report to the merit committees at all levels, (2) Write articles to newspapers at all levels to commend, (3) Report merit to family members, issue notices to introduce to friendly neighboring troops... etc. Because the congratulatory and reporting merits are done carefully and solemnly, the liberated areas and liberated soldiers also require to issue "Merit Certificates," fearing that the merit will be lost due to job transfer or hospitalization. They all hope to take the merit home to glorify it, which is a manifestation of the upward development of the merit campaign.

The form of congratulating merit should be determined according to the size of the merit. For example, the company holds a meeting to invite the meritorious person to take a seat, post the list of meritorious persons, and write the names of the meritorious persons on the command flag. These small-scale ones can be carried out at any time. The larger-scale ones are carried out by battalion, regiment, or military-civilian conferences, and the chief personally leads the reception. Friendly neighboring troops write letters to send congratulatory gifts. This method is best held after each task is completed, and it must be arranged solemnly and seriously, and opened solemnly, and avoid being childish. Don't emphasize material rewards for meritorious persons, focus on political encouragement, and avoid fostering mercenary ideas and earning merits for material rewards. Such meritorious persons will never be consolidated and long-lasting. Sometimes, the meritorious comrades can be taken care of when the assets committee handles the enemy's seized materials as a reward for the meritorious persons, which has a better effect.

    部队立功运动经验介绍
    现在后方正在开展立功运动，我们把前线部队立功经验整理了一下，企图使我们后方领导同志从这里得到一些启示，虽然前后方条件不同，但有些基本经验是可以参考的。
    我前线部队，自从开展立功运动以来，部队面貌为之一新，战斗力空前提高，各种工作都向前推进一步。在这轰轰烈烈的立功运动过程中，获得了很多经验，其中最主要的有下面几个：
    （一）关于立功思想领导问题
    一、立功运动是符合群众要求的思想自觉运动，为此必须加强立功运动的思想领导，只有领导思想与群众要求相结合，打破一切思想障碍，并逐步提高群众认识，才能使立功运动全面而深入的开展起来。群众对立功运动是热情而认真的。号召发出后，各部队都先后掀起了杀敌立功热潮，许多同志表示了为人民立功的决心，宣布了自己的杀敌立功计划，涌现出来不少英雄人物，这些现象都反映了群众的情绪，也证明了立功运动的提出是符合群众的思想实际的。各级领导同志对群众情绪是否能深刻体会，及时解决群众所反映的具体问题，对自己所在部队立功运动的开展是有决定意义的。
    二、思想教育是立功运动的基础。领导思想明确，正确掌握运动发展，是运动开展的主要关键。在立功运动开始发动时，各个部队都根据当时部队的实际情况，采取了不同的思想动员步骤。有的经过诉苦复仇运动转入立功运动，有的经过时事前途教育转入立功运动，有的经过杀敌竞赛掀起立功运动，然后进行思想教育。有的经过各种会议动员反复说明立功运动意义，由此而掀起了立功热潮。这几个办法，经验证明，经过诉苦运动启发其阶级觉悟，掀起复仇决心转入立功运动，在思想上是比较巩固的。但还不能肯定的说非经过诉苦运动不行。问题中心还在于领导思想明确，正确掌握运动的发展。立功运动的开展，是发扬新英雄主义，推动一切工作，完成战斗任务最实际最有效的方法，是政治工作在自卫战争中的新发展。谁的思想不明确这点，把它庸俗的看成是“新花样”，突击性工作”，“一般号召”，而不动员军政干部协同来搞，不去正确掌握立功运动的发展，及时解决具体问题，及时总结，谁就不能把立功运动搞起来。
    三、打破思想障碍，消除死角，把立功范围扩大，把所有人员都卷进来。在立功运动中，如果单纯强调杀敌立功，思想障碍就必然产生，也就必然产生运动的“死角”，如果思想障碍不能打破，便不能将所有人员卷入到立功运动的浪潮中。经验证明，思想障碍的主要方面是干部思想问题。有些干部认为：“立功运动是为了发动战士”；某些军事干部认为“立功运动是政治工作者的事情”，而把自己放在圈外。机关干部认为“不打仗不能立功”，或者抱“不求有功，但求无过”的消极态度。有的提出“机关干部是否能立功？”“如何立功？”等问题。克服以上思想障碍，要经过党内讨论，并发动积极分子在军人大会中首先表示态度，起带头作用，隆重进行动员，提出“只要有决心，人人能立功”等口号，诱导大家讨论，并以领导干部之模范行动影响大家，这样才能掀起立功热潮。
    在战士中，开始强调了缴枪捉俘虏，这样在战士中也发生了错觉，许多特种兵认为“咱无法立功”，而这种思想障碍，很快由群众自己解决了。如某机枪班提出“枪响见血”作为机枪班的立功标准，其他炊事员、电话员、理发员等也都订出自己的立功标准计划。总之，群众中产生的思想障碍，应发动诱导群众自己去解决，这便是打破思想障碍与消灭“死角”的基本办法。但思想障碍与“死角”在运动发展过程中，还会不断发生，领导上必须深入了解群众思想情况，反复发动讨论，进行动员解释工作，解除群众的任何怀疑及消极情绪，提高群众的认识。
    四、表扬典型，培植典型，树立旗帜，以推动运动前进。在立功运动中各个部队都出现了个人的集体的模范典型，领导上应善于表扬这些典型，号召大家向他们看齐，以奖励各种人员中的模范，影响全体。但立功运动中涌现的典型，往往不是全面的，不是各方面都好，还需要领导上的帮助、培植。如果出现了典型，而不去有意识的培养提高，往往就会自生自灭。
    （二）普遍订出立功计划，是立功运动的开始，也是造成群众运动的有效步骤。
    订计划是表示立功决心，确定努力目标的。各个部队在进行思想动员后，都曾提出号召，要大家订立功计划，有些部队的领导干部并亲自首先订出自己的杀敌立功计划，以影响整个部队，特别是影响干部。但立功计划，必须从实际出发，必须与自己岗位工作之实际情况相结合。许多同志的计划只凭一时热情提出，往往过高，不能完成，便会走上失去信心。这是需要领导上掌握的。因此在大家订出计划以后，还须发动大家来审查计划。立功计划还必须依据部队情况之变化，逐渐修改提高，并增加新的内容，特别是要与部队之弱点结合起来。如某部干部在立功计划中，在一次战斗后，增加了“掌握部队”一条，而在另一次战斗时，部队即秩然有序。这是很好的经验。
    目前立功计划，大多是个人的，还应提高到集体方面，提倡互助立功。但没有个人立功的发动而过早强调集体，往往也会落空。
    （三）表功、比功、评功、记功，必须相信群众，走群众路线。
    立功运动是群众运动，必须由下而上的进行群众性的表功、比功、评功、记功，才能使群众心悦诚服，任何领导上包办的现象必须克服。
    表功是最重要的工作，但开始发动表功时，大家互相客气不好意思说，某部开始表功时，曾有这个现象。后来一个战士说了他缴一支枪的经过，谈了自己的功劳，而且批评了别人（包括对指挥的意见），领导上便以此例来诱导大家，结果表功展开了。这种表功谈经验的方式是很好的。在表功以后，紧接着便是进行比功，“看谁的功劳大？该记功？”要大家讨论（争论），最后是可以得到正确结论的。（以上表功比功的方式在干部中同样可采用。）评功中有的部队只注意缴枪数目或是一般化的提出来负伤就是一功，因此战士们便有意见，提出：“不是战斗中缴的枪，是搜索中缴的枪，不能记功！”“我冲到前面没有负伤，他在后面畏缩负了伤，也不能记功！”……等意见，这都是正确的。因此评功还须根据战斗中的作用，当时的具体情况及其平时表现，但平时表现不是主要的，如平时表现不好，而在战斗中表现勇敢，有缴获，也应记功，这时有的战士也会不同意给他记功的，领导上需要掌握。
    评功、记功的标准和办法，是还没有最后解决的问题，事实上也很难订出统一的标准与办法。但评功准确，记功才不会发生偏差，群众对功臣才能够佩服，是肯定的。一般评功办法有：一、规定条件，如以突破前沿，缴获多寡，有什么新创造……等为评订大小功的标准；二、按分记功。如完成任务（整训行军作战）为六十分，战场与群众纪律各十分，互助二十分，以六十分为合格算一大功。三、经群众会议根据具体材料订定功绩。四、有特殊功绩者记特功。
    这几种评功方法，第一种限定条件，灵活性小，往往会偏重一面，忽视了一个同志的另一面的长处或短处，不易巩固。第三种虽然民主性大，而不准确，发展的结果会流于不认真不慎重及感情用事。第二种方法的范围较广，较为完善，可以不同的任务灵活变动，如作战以战功为主（六十分），整训以学习为主（六十分），再经群众根据完成任务的好坏来评定，一般的偏差均可减免。
    记功方法基本上有两种：一、随时记，由班长每天向功委会汇报，或由班挑选出记功员和记功组长，把每天材料登记。二、任务完成后经各级会议总结，评功记功，两种方法都有好处。
    功过问题：有的采用“功能折罪，过须减功”的办法，经研究后，认为：功过不要抵消，功是功，过是过，有功可以免过，有过不能减功，如同时发生过功，则同时登记起来，有功记功，有过记过，团营由分区（旅）记，连排由团记。
    （四）报功、贺功
    报功与贺功是立功运动中最重要的一环，因其本身带有强烈的荣誉形式，为广大士兵群众所最关心的问题。这一工作搞好了，对整个运动的推动起到很大作用，但也同样往往因为紧张的战斗环境而被忽视。
    “立功上报”，上报最光荣，已为普遍的心理，因此在各级功委会要指定专门的报功员，作对外报导，其任务是：（一）向各级立功委员会报告，（二）向各级报纸写稿表扬，（三）向家属报功，出通报向友邻部队介绍……等。由于贺功报功作得慎重隆重，解放区和解放战士还要求发“功劳证”，怕调动工作或住院把功劳掉了，都希望把功劳带到家里去光荣光荣，这是立功运动向上发展的表现。
    贺功要看功劳大小而决定形式，如连队开会请功臣上坐，张贴功臣榜，把功臣名字写在指挥旗上。这些小型的可以随时进行，规模较大的以营、团或军民大会进行，首长亲自领导招待。友邻部队写信送贺礼，这种办法以每一任务完成后举行最好，而必须布置得严肃认真，开得隆重，切忌儿戏从事。对功臣不强调物质奖励，着重政治上的鼓励，避免养成雇佣思想，及为得到物质奖励而立功，这种功臣绝不会巩固和长久的。对立功同志有时可通过资委会处理缴获敌物资时加以照顾，作为功臣的奖励，其效用较好。
