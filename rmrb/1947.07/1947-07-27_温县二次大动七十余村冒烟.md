Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 24th -- Wen County in the Taihang New District has launched its second land reform movement. From mid-May, when the county was liberated, to mid-June, the peasant associations struck down 766 despotic bullies and recovered over 20,000 mu of land. However, about a quarter of the villages in the county had not yet made a breakthrough. Even in so-called advanced villages like Gaozhao Village, out of 482 adult peasants, only 29 were active, 72 were average, and 381 were lagging behind. The goal of completely eliminating feudalism and fully mobilizing the masses was still far off. After a review at the county-district cadres' conference last month, it was determined that the focus should continue to be on vigorous and widespread mobilization, not just on deepening efforts. A fierce mobilization was needed to "ignite every village, causing the entire county to erupt" and to "strike while the iron is hot, without delay."

On the night of "July 1st" (CCP founding day), peasants throughout the county acted simultaneously, launching a major offensive against despotic bullies and landlords. By the morning of the 2nd, all the despotic bullies in the county had been arrested. To ensure a thorough clearing, all villagers were investigated for any people from other villages during the arrest of the despotic bullies. Thus, despotic bullies who had been living freely for a long time in neighboring villages, districts, and counties fell into the hands of the peasants. At the same time, a large-scale training program for poor peasants was launched throughout the county, with 12,000 participants, accounting for one-tenth of the county's total population. With more people, their courage was strengthened, military cadres, family members, village cadres took the lead. New and old grievances were thoroughly aired. At this time, successive reports of the liberation of Bo'ai, Qinyang, and Meng Counties were received, further boosting the fighting spirit of the peasants throughout the county. On the 6th, the trained poor peasants and hired laborers from each district returned to their villages. The poor peasants and hired laborers from Beizhangqiang Village in the Third District returned to their village on the 7th. That night, a mass meeting of the whole village was held. Everyone said that the turn over must be complete. But as the saying goes, you can know a man's face but not his heart, no one knew what others were thinking. At the request of the masses, a "Peasant Turn-Over Single-Minded Association" was established. Under the fierce attack of the peasants, by the 9th, over seventy villages in the county had once again launched a fierce struggle against despotic bullies and landlords.

　　温县二次大动七十余村冒烟
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫二十四日电】太行新区温县二次掀起土地改革运动。自五月中旬该县解放至六月中旬，农民会打垮了七百六十六个奸霸，收回两万余亩土地，但全县尚有约四分之一的村庄未突破，而所谓先进村，如高肇村，成年农民四百八十二人，积极分子仅二十九人，一般的七十二人，落后的三百八十一人，距彻底消灭封建充分发动群众尚远。经上月下旬全县县区干部大会检讨，确定今后仍是继续大力普遍发动问题，不是深入问题，要来个“村村点火、全县冒烟”，“趁热打铁、决不迟延”的猛烈发动。“七一”之夜，全县农民同时动作，向奸霸地主展开大进攻，至二日上午即将全县奸霸全部逮捕。为了清底，在逮捕奸霸过程中，各村并清查所有外村人，于是在外村外区邻县逍遥已久之奸霸，均落入农民之手。与此同时，全县展开贫农大训练，参加者达一万二千人，占全县总人口的十分之一。人多胆壮，军干属村干带头，新旧仇苦一齐诉透。此时光复博爱、沁阳、孟县三城捷报接连传来，全县农民斗争情绪益高，各区受训贫、雇农即于六日分头回村。三区北张羌村受训贫雇农七日回到本村，当夜就召开全村群众大会，大家说翻身一定要翻，就是人心隔肚皮，谁也不知谁是啥心思，在群众要求下，成立“农民翻身一心会”。在农民急风暴雨的进攻下至九日止，全县已有七十余村，再度向奸霸地主展开猛烈斗争。
