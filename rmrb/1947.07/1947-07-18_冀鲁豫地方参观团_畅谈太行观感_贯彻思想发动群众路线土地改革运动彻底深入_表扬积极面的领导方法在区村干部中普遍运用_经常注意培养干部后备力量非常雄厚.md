    Hebei-Shandong-Henan Local Visiting Group
    Talks About Impressions of Taihang

    Implement Ideological Mobilization and Mass Line; Thoroughly and Deeply Carry Out Land Reform Movement

    Leadership Methods of Praising the Positive Aspects are Widely Used Among District and Village Cadres

    Constant Attention is Paid to Cultivating a Strong Reserve of Cadres

    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Hebei-Shandong-Henan local work visiting group, consisting of more than forty people, arrived in Taihang at the beginning of last month. After visiting and investigating in Licheng and Changzhi counties, they have now returned to Hebei-Shandong-Henan. On the 8th of this month, at a symposium held by the Central Bureau Office, the visiting group comrades spoke freely about their impressions of this trip, unanimously praising the thoroughness of the land reform there. The comrades who visited Changzhi and Village used specific survey materials to show that before the land reform movement, two-thirds of the landlords' land in the village had already been returned to the peasants. After the land reform movement, the peasants carried out another thorough confiscation and distribution of the landlords' land, grain, farm tools, and hidden goods. The landlord class was truly trampled underfoot and bowed its head to the peasants. The peasants were also completely separated from the landlords ideologically. Each emancipated peasant in the village has obtained more than four mu of land (including the original portion), and the hired poor have received even more. From beginning to end, the movement clearly ran through a class line of "taking the hired poor as the backbone and uniting the middle peasants." What they felt was most outstanding was ideological mobilization and the mass line: At the beginning of each movement, or a detail of work, the leading comrades started work by clearing up ideological understanding. Clearing up ideological understanding was based on the immediate interests of the masses and the advanced examples of the masses for education. This kind of ideological mobilization work often took up two-thirds of the time and manpower of the movement. Their work also showed a special solidity and depth because of this. In the application of leadership methods, the comrades who visited Beiliu Village in Licheng believed that Chairman Mao's leadership methods have been widely used among district and village cadres. Every cadre used the method of "grasping the positive side and grasping the active side" very well. From the county to the district, and from the village to the mutual aid group, we saw that they all adopted the method of more praise and less criticism. When praising, they adopted a variety of methods such as village-wide meetings, blackboards, and loudspeakers. When criticizing, they adopted individual talks. Experience has proven that praising the good is the most powerful criticism of the bad. Now, being praised is the most honorable thing in the village. Therefore, everyone wants to be a model, and everyone wants to be praised. In promoting the work of the whole village, the hero groups among the masses played a huge leading role. Every street in Beiliu Village has heroes, every system and every department has heroes. These heroes are surrounded by countless activists and peasants. The village leadership maintains the closest contact with these hero groups, relying on these hero groups, the understanding of all situations in the village and the progress of work rarely encounter difficulties. To promote the work of a district, they focused on key points and paid special attention to cultivating leading villages, using these leading villages to play a leading and influencing role. Xia Village in Licheng played a good leading role in promoting the textile movement in a nearby area of villages. For areas with uneven work, they loudly put forward the slogan of "facing the backward and striving for balance." Every working comrade consciously provided particularly patient assistance to backward villages when deploying work, and put greater strength into that area, quickly improving these types of villages and gradually moving them towards balance. As for paying constant attention to cultivating cadres and cultivating their own replacements in the movement, this has become a kind of ethos among local cadres. Therefore, the reserve force of cadres there is exceptionally strong. After our army's great counter-offensive, although a large number of cadres were transferred to the new areas, the work there was not affected in the slightest. What made the visiting group most satisfied was the reduction of the people's burden. This was due to the in-depth consolidation of village finances, saving expenses, and using village public production (cooperatives, factories, etc.) to solve a part of the burden on the masses. Since Licheng rectified village finances, one-half of the villages in the county have already freed the people from bearing local grain payments and village finances. In terms of work style, "meticulousness and attention to detail" is a characteristic of work at all levels. Survey and research offices and joint offices at all levels have various systematic survey materials. When a task is assigned downwards, the branch always conducts in-depth mobilization to all systems, mutual aid groups, and even families, so that all forces are organized into the movement, forming a truly all-peasant movement.

    冀鲁豫地方参观团
    畅谈太行观感
    贯彻思想发动群众路线土地改革运动彻底深入
    表扬积极面的领导方法在区村干部中普遍运用
    经常注意培养干部后备力量非常雄厚
    【本报特讯】冀鲁豫地方工作参观团，一行四十余人，于上月初抵达太行，在黎城长治两县参观调查后，日前已返回冀鲁豫。本月八日，中央局办公厅召开的座谈会上，参观团同志纷纷畅谈此行观感，一致赞扬那里的土地改革作的彻底。参观长治和村的同志，用具体的调查材料，说明该村地主土地在土改运动前，已有三分之二归还了农民，土地改革运动后，地主的土地、粮食、农具以及埋藏的内货，农民又进行了一次彻底的没收分配，地主阶级真正被踏在脚下，向农民低下了头，农民在思想上，也和地主完全分开了家。村中每个翻身农民，已得到四亩多土地（原有部分在内），雇贫分得更多一些，运动从头至尾，显明的贯串着一条“以雇贫为骨干团结中农”的阶级路线。他们感到最出色的，是思想发动和群众路线：每个运动之初，或一个工作细节，领导同志都以打通思想去开始工作，打通思想又是根据群众切身的利益和群众先进的例子进行教育的，这种思想发动的工作，往往占去运动三分之二的时间和人力。他们的工作，就此也表现出了特别的巩固和深入。在领导方法的运用上，参观黎城北流村的同志认为：毛主席的领导方法，在区村干部中，已普遍被运用起来。每个干部对“抓紧正面，抓紧积极面”的方法，都运用得非常之好。我们从县到区，又从村到互助组，看到他们都是采取多表扬少批评的方法，表扬时采取全村大会、黑板报、广播筒等多种多样的方式，批评时则采取个别谈话。经验证明，表扬了好的，就最有力的批评了坏的，现在村里受表扬已经是最光荣的事情，因此，那个人都想当模范，那个人都想受表扬。在推动全村工作中，群众中的英雄集团起了极大的带头作用。北流村每条街都有英雄，每个系统以及每个部门都有英雄，这些英雄的周围，都团结着无数的积极分子和农民，村的领导上又与这些英雄集团保持着最密切的联系，依靠这些英雄集团，村里一切情况的了解，和工作的进行，都很少碰着困难。对于一个区的工作推动，他们抓紧了重点，特别注意培养领袖村，通过这些领袖村，去起带头影响作用。黎城下庄村，在推动附近一片村庄的纺织运动上，就很好的起到了领袖的作用。对于工作不平衡的地区，他们响亮的提出了“面向落后争取平衡”的口号，每个工作同志在布置工作时，都有意识的对落后村进行特别耐心的帮助，而且把较大的力量使到那方面去，迅速提高了这类村庄使其逐渐走向平衡。至于在运动中，经常注意培养干部，培养自己的代替人，已成当地干部的一种风气。因此那里的干部后备力量，异常雄厚。我军大反攻后，太行虽大批干部调往新区，但那里的工作却丝毫没有受到影响。使参观团感到最满意的，是人民负担的减轻，这是由于深入的进行了村财政整理，节省了开支，并用村公共生产（合作社工厂等）解决了群众一部分负担的缘故。黎城自整顿村财政后，全县已有二分之一的村庄，人民已不负担地方粮款和村财政。在作风上“缜密细微”更是各级工作的特点，各级调查研究室，联合办公室，都拥有各种系统的调查材料，而当一个工作往下布置时，总是先由支部向各系统、各互助小组以至于各家庭，都进行深入的动员，使一切力量都组织到运动中来，而形成了真正全体农民的运动。（泽然）
