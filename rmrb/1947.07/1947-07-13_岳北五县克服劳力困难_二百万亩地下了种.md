    【This newspaper Taiyue Tenth Electric】The Yuebei Prefectural Committee, in order to further implement the organization and ensure that participation in the war and production are not delayed, specially convened a production meeting of the five counties in the core area of Erqin (Qinyuan, Qin County), Anze, Tunliu, and Changzi on the 18th of last month. In addition to summarizing the production achievements of the past six months, the meeting focused on discussing how to implement the organization and lead participation in the war and production in the future. The summary pointed out the main production achievements of the counties in the past six months: First, in terms of agricultural production, under extremely difficult conditions of labor and livestock, the 2.48 million mu of land in the five counties were able to be sown in a timely manner. The millet and corn fields were plowed an average of two to three times. In Qin County, Changzi, and Tunliu, each mu was fertilized with more than 30 dan of manure, and Qin, Tun, Chang, and others eliminated most of the cultivated wasteland, about 80,000 mu. Second, in terms of agricultural mutual assistance, for example, in Qin County, 90% of the male full labor force was organized in five districts, and villages with mutual aid groups accounted for 95% in Qinyuan. Third, all localities correctly resolved the issue of plowing on behalf of those participating in the war during the production process, overcoming the past phenomenon of relying solely on mutual aid to plow on behalf of others. Reasonable regulations were formulated for plowing on behalf of family members of those participating in the war and military dependents. Fourth, a large number of labor heroes and production models emerged among cadres and the masses. For example, at the He Gong Conference in the Third District of Tunliu, more than 100 people were rewarded, truly ensuring that no one was idle. Cadres went to the fields with the masses, and cadres also went to the fields to lead in-depth and timely agricultural work. In order to further organize and implement the production increase movement in the future, the prefectural committee pointed out in the summary that mutual aid groups should be improved from the existing foundation, and it is even more necessary to cultivate backbones, promote experience, organize semi-labor force, organize women, and cultivate female cadres. In terms of drought prevention and famine preparedness, it is necessary to ensure that every household is prepared for famine and that everyone saves. Cooperatives should develop in combination with agricultural and sideline industries, and clean up cooperatives that were forcibly established with the fruits of struggle. In terms of local leadership, special attention must be paid to solving the problems that can and must be solved in the land reform in the production movement, and a comprehensive inspection should be carried out through the rectification of mutual aid, with several types, and preparations should be made for a review after the autumn.

    岳北五县克服劳力困难
    二百万亩地下了种
    【本报太岳十日电】岳北地委，为进一步贯彻组织起来，使参战和生产两不误，特于上月十八召开腹心区二沁（沁源、沁州）安（泽）屯（留）长（子）五县生产会议，会上除总结半年来生产成绩外，并着重讨论了今后如何贯彻组织起来及参战生产领导等问题。总结中指出各县半年生产主要成绩有：一、农业生产上在劳畜力极端困难的条件下，五县二百四十八万亩土地，都能及时下种，谷子、玉茭地平均都犁过两遍到三遍。沁县、长子、屯留每亩上粪在三十担以上，沁、屯、长等并消灭了大部熟荒约八万余亩。二、农业互助上，如沁县五个区组织了男全劳力百分之九十，沁源有互助组的村占百分之九十五。三、各地都于生产中间正确的解决了参战代耕，克服了过去单靠互助代耕的现象。合理的规定出参战家属军属代耕办法。四、在干部与群众中出现了大批劳动英雄、生产模范，如屯留的三区贺功大会上，有一百多人受到奖励，真正做到不闲一个人，干部作到了群众到地，干部也到地，不误农时的深入领导。地委为了今后进一步组织起来，贯彻增产运动，特在总结中指出互助组要从现有的基础上提高一步，更要培养骨干，推广经验，组织半劳力，组织妇女及培养妇女干部。防旱备荒上要做到家家备荒，人人节约。合作社要发展与农副业结合，并清理强迫用斗争果实办起的合作社。各地领导上，尤须注意在生产运动中解决土地改革中可能解决和必须解决的问题，并通过整顿互助，普遍作一次检查，有几种类型，准备秋后复查。
