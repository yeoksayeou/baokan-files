    Preparing Small Autumn Grain Seeds
    To the Editor:
    The present solar term has reached Minor Heat. According to experienced farmers, if it rains around Minor Heat, it is still possible to sow grain crops. If it is delayed any further, grain cannot be sown. (Because it won't have time to mature before the frost, or it will wither and die due to the cold). After Minor Heat and the Autumn Equinox, only small autumn grain crops such as buckwheat and millet can be planted; or only autumn vegetables such as cabbage, radish, and turnips can be planted. According to an investigation in Xia Village, Wu'an, this area has not been accustomed to planting buckwheat and millet in the past. Even if there is an opportunity to plant them in the future, some places severely lack the relevant seeds. It is said that there are many buckwheat and millet seeds in Daming and Wei counties in southern Hebei. It is hoped that responsible comrades in various localities will pay sufficient attention to the preparation for planting small autumn grain crops. Timely grasp the investigation, make a planned adjustment to solve this urgent problem.
    Respectfully,
                    Ma Mingwen

    准备小日月种子编辑同志：
    现时的农节已到了小暑了，据务农有经验者谈：小暑前后如果得雨，尚能下种谷类作物。如再晚下去，种谷就不行了。（因等不到长熟便下了霜，或因天寒而枯死）大暑秋分过雨，只可种植荞麦，黍稷等小日月庄稼，；或者只能种秋菜，如白菜、罗卜、芜菁等。据武安夏庄调查知道，由于过去此地不习惯种植荞麦黍稷，即便将来有机会想种它，但有些地方非常缺乏该项种子，听说关于荞麦黍稷等种子，在冀南大名、魏县等县很多，希望各地地方负责同志，对于准备种植小日月庄稼，要足够注意。及时抓紧调查，有计划的作过当调剂，以解决此项亟待解决之问题。
    敬礼          马鸣文
