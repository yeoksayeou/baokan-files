　　Opinions on Current Production in New and Old Areas
    Ju Xiang, Yong Xian, Xiao Quan, Luo Guang
    In order to strengthen the production movement in the future, in addition to continuing to promote the valuable experience of various regions, increase enthusiasm for production, massively organize auxiliary labor, and promote the leadership methods of commendation and model recognition, we put forward the following suggestions for the current movement:

    I. In old areas where the disaster is not severe, we should still adhere to the policy of "cultivating three and having surplus one," expand mutual aid teams, improve technology, and step up weeding and topdressing to achieve deep plowing and careful cultivation to increase yields. Pingshun has done a very good job in this regard. The specific situation is as follows:

    In the past, Pingshun did not have the habit of weeding wheat. However, this year, in wheat weeding, the county planted 53,584.3 mu of wheat, of which 32,602.4 mu had been weeded once, accounting for 60 percent (excluding the sixth district), and many had been weeded three times. In terms of applying fertilizer, the average amount per mu was 78 dan in the first district, 50 dan in the second district, 37 dan in the third district, 34 dan in the fourth district, 80 dan in the fifth district, 42 dan in the sixth district, and 44.5 dan in the seventh district, which is a significant increase compared to last year. For example, the average amount in the fifth district was 70 dan per mu last year, and this year it has increased by an average of 10 dan per mu. In terms of plowing, harrowing, and raking, in the first district, 1,459 mu were plowed once, 17,675.7 mu were plowed twice, and 11,079.2 mu were plowed three times. 2,919 mu were harrowed and raked once, 15,074.5 mu were harrowed and raked twice, and statistics from 13 villages showed 870.07 mu harrowed and raked three times. Statistics from 33 natural villages showed 344.2 mu harrowed and raked twice, and statistics from 30 villages showed 1,813.67 mu harrowed and raked three times. According to statistics from 30 villages, 4,128 mu were harrowed and raked three times. In the valley areas, 781.5 mu were plowed once in 10 administrative villages, 10,386.8 mu were plowed twice in 38 natural villages, and 5,601.2 mu were harrowed twice in 25 administrative villages. 399 mu were harrowed and raked once, 7,234.9 mu were harrowed and raked twice, and 8,469.2 mu were harrowed and raked three times. There were also 666 mu that were harrowed and raked five or six times.

    Such a practice of deep plowing, careful cultivation, and high grain production is indeed worth learning from in various regions. In areas severely affected by drought, in addition to more weeding to protect seedlings, we should also seize the opportunity to plant more autumn vegetables, organize all available labor, and plant radishes, rapeseed, etc. on time before the beginning of autumn to eliminate all fallow land and increase food supply.

    II. The development of mutual aid teams in new areas is very rapid. In the future, we should rectify and resolve outstanding issues, and strictly implement the principle of equal value, which is the key to consolidating mutual aid teams. Because new areas lack experience in organization, they initially responded to the call of higher authorities to increase organization, so organization was fast, but collapse was also fast. The most important reason for this was unequal value and fear of suffering losses. In Su Dian Nan Jie, Changzhi, eight out of thirteen groups had wage problems. Later, by reviewing the shortcomings of last year and summarizing the advantages of last year, the masses realized the benefits of organizing, and after establishing a fair and reasonable system of equal value exchange and calculating work points, the masses voluntarily organized 38 groups, few of which were old groups. Therefore, the principle of equal value is a very important issue.

    III. Implement land reform in production and combine it with review. Outstanding issues in land reform in old areas should be resolved in conjunction with production, otherwise it will affect production. For example, if the relationship between cadres and the masses is not resolved well, the masses' enthusiasm for production will not be high, and without leading backbone, the production movement cannot be carried out. In Heishan, Heshun, the masses were very energetic in production, but the cadres were not, and they could not lead the masses because the relationship between cadres and the masses was not good. After the problem was resolved and a review was conducted, the cadres took the lead, selected models and commended them, and the masses' enthusiasm became even greater. In Nantianhe, Changzhi, the fruits of struggle were not distributed in production, and the cadres took the small things, and the masses reflected that it was not democratic. Later, the mutual aid teams discussed it as a unit, and those who had taken things returned them voluntarily. Labor hero Cao Linshui formulated plans to get rich, hired long-term workers, bought livestock, reclaimed wasteland, and planted cotton, and the masses were also very enthusiastic. Therefore, it is very important to implement land reform in the production movement, combine it with review, and resolve outstanding issues.

    IV. Strengthening party branch construction from production, establishing the leadership backbone of poor and hired peasants, and strengthening the unity between cadres and the masses are important links in production. After the land reform, the peasants were emancipated and had land, and their class consciousness was raised. The poor and hired peasants, especially the party members of the branch, played a leading role in the village. Therefore, further transforming and consolidating the party branch in production is the key to all work issues. Every party member must participate in mutual aid teams, unite with the middle peasants, lead the masses to become rich, defeat Chiang Kai-shek, play a backbone leading role, ensure mutual assistance is voluntary, exchange is equal, strengthen internal unity and unity between cadres and the masses, and make the production movement develop vigorously and rapidly.

　　对当前新老区生产意见
    菊香、永献、效泉、洛光
    为了加强今后生产运动，除继续发扬各地宝贵经验，提高生产热情，大量组织辅助劳力及推行表功表模的领导方法外，对当前运动提出如下的几点意见：
    一、老区在灾荒不严重地区，仍应坚持耕三余一的方针，扩大互助组，提高技术，加紧锄苗追肥，作到深耕细作，增加产量。平顺在这方面做得很好，其具体情况如下：
    平顺过去没有锄麦习惯，然而今年在锄麦上，全县种麦五万三千五百八十四亩三分，锄过一遍的有三万二千六百零二亩四分，占百分之六十（缺六区），其中很多且锄了三遍。上粪，一区每亩平均七十八担，二区平均五十担，三区平均三十七担，四区平均三十四担，五区平均八十担，六区平均四十二担，七区平均四十四担半，和去年比较有很大增加，如五区去年平均每亩七十担，今年就每亩平均增加十担。犁、耢、耙方面，一区犁一遍的一千四百五十九亩，二遍的一万七千六百七十五亩七分，三遍的就有一万一千零七十九亩二分。耢、耙一遍的有二千九百一十九亩，二遍的有一万五千零七十四亩五分，三遍的有十三个村的统计八百七十亩零七分，二遍的三十三个自然村，统计三百四十四亩二分，三遍的三十个村，有一千八百一十三亩六分七，耢、耙三遍的据卅个村统计有四千一百二十八亩，谷地犁一遍的十个行政村，共地七百八十一亩五分，二遍三十八个自然村，共地一万零三百八十六亩八分，犁二遍的有二十五个行政村，共耙五十六百零一亩二分，耢、耙一遍的三百九十九亩，二遍的七千二百三十四亩九分，三遍的共八千四百六十九亩二分，五遍六遍的还有六百六十六亩。
    象这样深耕细作多产粮食的做法，确是各地值得学习的。在受旱严重影响下种的地区除多锄护苗外，还应抓紧时机多种秋菜，组织一切可用的劳力，在立秋以前，把萝卜油菜等按时种上，消灭一切熟荒，增加食粮。
    二、新区互助组的发展很快，今后应整顿解决遗留问题，严格执行等价政策，是巩固互助组的关键。因为新区缺乏组织起来的经验，开始为响应上级号召，要求增加组织，所以产生组织快，但垮台也快，其中最主要原因是不等价，怕吃亏。长治苏店南街十三个小组，就有八个组存在工资问题。以后从检讨去年的缺点，总结去年的优点，使群众认识组织起来的好处，确立了公平合理的等价交换，计工折工等一套制度后，群众才自愿组织起来三十八个组，其中很少是旧组，因此等价政策是很重要的问题。
    三、在生产中贯彻土改，结合复查。老区土改中遗留问题应在生产中结合解决，否则将影响生产。如干群关系解决不好，群众生产情绪不高、缺乏领导骨干，生产运动即无法进行。和顺黑山生产中群众劲大，干部劲小，带领不起群众，原因是干群关系没稿好，干部成了群众“斗争对象”，当解决后作了检讨，干部起了带头，选模表功，群众积极性更大了。长治南天河在生产中，斗争果实没经过分配，小东西干部拿走了，群众反映不民主，以后互助组为单位讨论，拿过的自动退出来，劳英曹林水订发家计划、雇长工、买牲口、开荒地、种棉花，群众劲头也很大，所以生产运动中贯彻土改，结合复查，解决遗留问题很是重要。
    四、从生产中加强支部建设，树立贫雇领导骨干，加强干群团结是生产中重要一环。土地改革后，农民翻了身，有了地，阶级觉悟提高，在村起领导骨干作用的是贫雇农，尤其是支部的党员同志，所以在生产中进一步改造与巩固支部，是一切工作问题的关键。每个党员，必须参加互助组，团结中农，领导群众发家致富，击败蒋介石，起骨干的领导作用，保证互助自愿，等价交换，加强内部团结和干群团结，使生产运动猛烈迅速的开展。
