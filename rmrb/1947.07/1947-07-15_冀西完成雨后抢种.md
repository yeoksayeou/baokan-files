Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 12th. Western Hebei counties have been engaged in emergency planting for a week following the rain. Most areas have completed the planting, with a few still working on it. In individual areas where the rain did not penetrate deeply enough, water is being carried to supplement the sowing. Of the more than two million mu of newly sown autumn fields, the seedlings in some parts have sprouted and are growing well. During the emergency planting campaign, other village work has been temporarily suspended, and the land reform work teams are leading and assisting the masses in planting. This period coincides with the launch of our army's Baoding North Campaign. Support for the front lines is intense. In addition to mobilizing 300,000 women and children to participate in the emergency planting, the entire area has also organized labor allocation groups that combine war support and emergency planting. All personnel on duty are given priority in planting, and it is stipulated that one day of duty counts as one and a half workdays of production, ensuring that neither war support nor emergency planting is delayed.

    冀西完成雨后抢种
    【新华社晋察冀十二日电】冀西各县雨后突击抢种已历一周，大部地区均已完成，少数地区尚在抢种中，个别得雨未透地区，亦以担水补充下种。新播种之二百余万亩秋田，小苗部分已出土，生长良好。在抢种运动中，村中其他工作均暂告停顿，土地改革工作组亦领导与协助群众抢种。此时适值我军保（定）北战役展开，支援前线紧张，全区除动员了三十万妇女、儿童参加抢种外，均组织了战勤与抢种结合的拨工组，凡出勤人员均获得优先播种，且规定出勤一天顶生产一个半工，使战勤与抢种两工作均未耽误。
