Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th – A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on the current situation, stating: Chiang Kai-shek personally proposed and passed the so-called general mobilization resolution to the Kuomintang's so-called "three-party government" on the 4th of this month. This fact proves to the people of the whole country for the last time two things: First, Chiang Kai-shek is the culprit of the civil war; Second, since the Chongqing Jiaochangkou massacre last year, the Kuomintang secret agents have carried out a series of fascist atrocities, betrayed the January 10, 1946 truce agreement, launched a civil war, signed the Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty selling out the country, used American weapons to slaughter compatriots, reinstated the Japanese war criminal Neiji Okamura to participate in the civil war, everywhere arresting men for conscription, collecting grain and levying funds, betrayed the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, convened a bogus National Assembly, formulated a bogus constitution, expelled the CCP representatives, occupied Yan'an, and arrested and massacred students, journalists, and democrats who opposed civil war, opposed hunger, opposed dictatorship, and opposed selling out the country. All these crimes were initiated by Chiang Kai-shek. All these perverse actions of Chiang Kai-shek are for the benefit of American imperialism and the Chinese reactionaries, but they cause the Chinese people to suffer and die. Chiang Kai-shek's general mobilization is Chiang Kai-shek's total collapse. General mobilization will not save Chiang Kai-shek's military, economic, and political crises; on the contrary, it can only aggravate these crises. Chiang Kai-shek's collapse is inevitable. The people of the whole country, due to Chiang Kai-shek's general mobilization, are facing greater and deeper suffering, and at the same time, they have increasingly realized that the source of these sufferings is Chiang Kai-shek. If Qingfu is not eliminated, the troubles in Lu will not end; if the traitor Chiang is not removed, the country will have no peace. Thus, for the sake of eliminating their own disasters, the Chinese people must condemn and execute this chief culprit of the civil war and traitorous villain. The Kuomintang members who are faithful followers of Sun Yat-sen should unite and, together with the people, punish this traitor. If there is anyone in the Kuomintang in power who still has a bit of conscience, they should arrest Chiang Kai-shek, announce his crimes of harming the country and endangering the people, and submit him to the judgment of the people.

    蒋贼介石卖国殃民
    国人都可得而诛之
    新华社记者评国内时局
    【新华社陕北十三日电】新华社记者评时局称：蒋介石于本月四日亲自向国民党的所谓“三党政府”提出并通过的所谓总动员决议，这一事实最后一次向全国人民证明了两件事：第一、内战祸首就是蒋介石；第二、从去年重庆较场口惨案以来，国民党特务的一系列的法西斯暴行，背叛一九四六年一月十日停战协定，发动内战，签订出卖祖国的中美商约，用美国武器屠杀同胞，起用日本战犯冈村宁次参加内战，到处抓丁征粮派款，背叛政协决议，召开伪国大，制定伪宪法，驱逐中共代表，进占延安，逮捕与屠残反内战、反饥饿、反独裁、反卖国的学生、记者、民主人士，所有这些罪行，都是蒋介石为首发动。蒋介石的这一切倒行逆施，都是为了美国帝国主义与中国反动派的利益，却叫中国人民遭殃送死。蒋介石的总动员就是蒋介石的总崩溃。总动员不会挽救蒋介石的军事、经济与政治危机，相反恰恰只能加重这些危机。蒋介石的崩溃无可避免。全国人民由于蒋介石的总动员，面临着更大更深的苦难，同时又已日益明白这些苦难的来源就是蒋介石。庆父不去，鲁难未已，蒋贼不除，国无宁日。这样对于内战的首祸卖国奸贼，中国人民为要免除自己的灾难，人人得而诛之。国民党中孙中山忠实信徒，应当团结起来，和人民一道，讨伐这个叛逆，国民党在朝派里如果有人还有一点良心，应该把蒋介石逮捕起来，宣布其祸国殃民的罪状，听候人民审判。
