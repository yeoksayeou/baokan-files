[Reported by this newspaper] The method used by the Guo Choude team of Beixianquan, Third District, Changzhi, for calculating work points and using work vouchers during the second weeding of seedlings is as follows: Weeding land three li away with some weeds earns 0.7 work points, weeding one mu of nearby land with weeds earns one work point, weeding one mu of corn earns half a work point, and the distribution of seedlings is determined based on their density. When distributing work vouchers, each household receives the number of work vouchers equivalent to the amount of work required for their land based on the number of mu they own and the amount of labor needed per mu. This makes it easier to settle accounts with the work vouchers. After settling accounts, it is clear who are long-term laborers and who are short-term laborers.

　　郭臭德组锄苗计工折工办法
    【本报讯】长治三区北仙泉郭臭德组，在二遍锄苗中的折工计工使用工票办法是：出门三里远的地还有草锄七分顶一个工，近地有草锄一亩顶一工，奶玉茭一亩算个半工，拔苗是根据稠稀来订分。发工票时每户有几亩地，每亩用多少工，全发给他需用工的工票，这样用工票好结算帐，一结帐就知道长工几个，短工几个。（锄苗运动报）
