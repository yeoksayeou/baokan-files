Millard's Review Reporter's Observations in Yan'an
(Editor's note: After our army proactively withdrew from Yan'an, Jiang Jieshi and Hu Zongnan organized a so-called Sino-foreign journalist group to observe. However, this trick not only failed to achieve its intended purpose, but the Chinese and foreign journalists instead recognized the strength of the CCP from the orderly retreat from Yan'an. The following article is excerpted from the Shanghai Millard's Review by a reader.)

We are visiting Yan'an, which has already changed its appearance. Although Hu Zongnan's subordinates took good care of me, they did not gather the people for me to listen to their criticisms of communism. However, the current situation in Yan'an can give us a considerable impression.

If a country could avoid major disasters by committing suicide, I think the Chinese people would be willing to choose this path. Apart from a few well-fed warlords and politicians, I am afraid that no one else likes to kill their compatriots, leaving only widows and orphans.

If half of the "so-called crimes of the Yan'an Communists" could be believed by us, they would have collapsed long ago.

The Communist Party has no arsenals and cannons, no navy and air force, and no means of transportation for modern warfare, but how can it continue the war and even expand it? How can it deliver reinforcements and armaments to the front-line soldiers? Why were the Communists able to evacuate almost all the men and women and animals together during the retreat? National Army officers replied that the Communists were driven away by their artillery fire (this reporter obviously does not believe this nonsense! – Translator). This can be said to be the greatest achievement in any war in history, because in an army with no transportation worth mentioning, it is not easy to transport all the people.

In a two-story house, we saw machine guns, mortars, rifles, cannons, and landmines, which were said to have been captured from the Communist army. Whether this is true is not yet known. It seems that most of these weapons were originally captured by the Communist army from the Japanese army, and some were obtained from the "National Army."

It is indeed not easy to defeat the "National Army" with such weapons.

We met a captured Communist soldier. He did not say that the Communist Party's conscription was against the will of the people. On the contrary, he said: "A comprehensive revolutionary movement will soon occur throughout the country, and it will overthrow all the forces of the current government." This is the belief of a captured Communist soldier! (Hu Yusheng's notes)

　　密勒氏评论周报记者的延安见闻
    （编者按：我军主动撤出延安后，蒋胡辈曾组织所谓中外记者团前往观察。但这套鬼把戏，不仅没有达到预期目的，中外记者们反而从延安有秩序的撤守中认识了中共的力量，下面记文是一位读者自上海密勒氏评论周报摘记寄来的。）
    我们正在拜访外形已脱的延安。胡宗南的部下虽然对我照料得很好，但是他们并没有为我召集人民让我听听他们对共产主义的批评。不过就今日延安情形来看，也可以给我们相当的印象了。
    一个国家假如能够用自杀方法来避免重大的灾祸时，我想中国人民一定愿意选择这条路。除去少数衣食充足的军阀和政客以外，恐怕再没有人喜欢杀死他们的同胞，使只剩下一些寡妇和孤儿们。
    如果“所谓延安共产党的罪恶”，有一半能让我们信以为真时，则他们就早就崩溃了。
    共产党没有兵工厂和大炮，没有海军和空军，没有近代战争的运输工具，可是他怎么会还能继续战争而且更加扩大呢？他又如何能把增援的军械送给前线的士兵呢？共党退却时何以能够把差不多全体的男女以及动物都一齐撤走呢？国军军官们回答说是共产党在炮火下给他们逐走的（这位记者显然不相信这些狗屁！——编者）。这可说是历史上任何战争中的最大成就，因为在一个没有值得称述的运输工具的陆军中，能把全部人民运出真不是件容易事。
    在一所两层的房子里面，我们看着在那里有机关枪，臼炮来福枪，炮和地雷，据说是从共军掳获来的，这是否真实还不知道，看来这些武器，也原多一半是当初共军方面由日军手中掳得来的，也有从“国军”手中弄来的。
    用这样的武器每能战胜“国军”实在也是不简单的事。
    我们遇见一个被俘的共军兵士，他并不说共产党的征兵是违反人民意志的，他反而说：“全国不久就要发生全面的革命运动了，而且要推翻现在政府的一切势力。”这是一个被俘共军兵士的信念！（胡玉生摘记）
