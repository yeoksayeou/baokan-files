　　[This Newspaper News] The Chengguan Sixth Street Cooperative in the First District of Wu'an held a dividend distribution meeting on July 1st. There were a total of 164 households and 264 male and female members. The meeting discussed how to distribute the dividends. Everyone recalled the suffering they endured in past famine years without food. This year, it hasn't rained, and it's another major drought. Grain is the lifeline, and we should divide all the dividends into grain to be used as famine relief. Some suggested using the money to repay debts, but in the end, it was decided to divide 70% into rice and 30% into cash. It was also proposed that the distributed rice should not be eaten now but stored away and eaten when the famine is most severe. A total of 26,912.5 jin of millet was distributed, averaging 102 jin of millet per member. At a rate of one jin per day, it is enough for one person to eat for 100 days. Each member already has three months' worth of famine relief grain. Members with more shares, such as Zhao Bai-shi (an old widow), received 200 jin of rice and 27,000 yuan in cash, while Bai Xiang, a family member of a soldier, received 400 jin of rice and 23,100 yuan in cash, both having half a year's worth of famine relief grain.

　　[This Newspaper Li Cheng News] The Beiliu Cooperative, since expelling feudal elements and kicking out the special agent landlords Li Daoshi and Li Aikui, the peasants are personally in charge of business. Under the correct leadership of Taihang Cooperative Hero Li Jiakui, the staff in the cooperative are very active. Comrade Li Jiakui, based on the situation in Beiliu: Although the village achieved "cultivate one, surplus one" last year, the masses still lack grain because many special products have not been converted into grain (especially cotton). Seizing the time to buy famine relief grain for the masses, he planned to extract the remaining funds to buy a batch of grain without affecting the business in all aspects, and also took out a batch of dividends from the account settlement from the first month of the year to buy grain. Now a total of 81 shi of millet and 11 shi of corn have been bought back. And the more than 3,000 jin of cotton in stock in the cooperative was transported to Tunliu and Changzhi areas to exchange for millet, which can be exchanged for 160 shi of millet. He also organized the masses to transport the grain, and just by calculating the transportation cost from Weizi Town this time, the masses earned a total of more than 98,000 yuan, which can buy 3.5 shi of millet. The masses reflected: "This is really our own business, it is 'watertight,' buying grain for us to overcome the famine, and organizing transportation for us to earn money, all for our sake!"

  　红利换米二万斤社员分得备荒粮
    【本报讯】武安一区城关六街合作社在七月一号召开分红大会，共入股户有一百六十四户，男女社员二百六十四人，大会讨论如何分红。大家都回想到过去灾荒年，没粮食吃受了罪，今年到如今不下雨，又是个大灾荒，粮食就是命根，咱要把红利都分成粮食，做备荒粮。有的提出我要化款还外债，最后决定七成分米，三成分钱。并提出分下的米现在不吃，要保存起来，到灾荒最严重时再吃，共分下去小米二万六千九百一十二斤半，平均每一社员合一百零二斤小米。一天按一斤计，够一个人一百天吃。每一社员已有了三个月的备荒粮。入股金多的如赵白氏（孤老婆）一个人分了二百斤米，现款二万七千元，抗属白香的分到米四百斤，现款二万三千一百元，都有了半年的备荒粮。（合作小报）
    【本报黎城讯】北流合作社，自挤清封建，踢出了特务地主李道士、李爱魁后，农民亲自当家负责营业。在太行合作英雄李甲魁的正确领导下，社内的职员都很积极，李甲魁同志根据北流的情况：按该村虽在去年全村达到了耕一余一，但群众的粮食却很缺乏，原因是特产多没变成粮食（特别是棉花）。抓紧时间，给群众买备荒粮，他在各方的业务不受影响下，有计划的抽出余款先买一批粮食，并拿出从正月结帐到现在的一批红利，全买成粮食，现共买回小米八十一石，玉茭十一石。并将社内现存的三千余斤棉花，运到屯留、长治一带往回换小米，计能换小米一百六十石。他并且组织群众运输，光按这次从微子镇运回的粮食脚价计，群众共赚洋九万八千余元，可买小米三石五斗。群众反映说：“这才真是自己的买卖，是‘汤水不漏’，给咱买粮让咱渡荒，又组织搞运输让咱赚钱，光是给咱打算哩”！（干清、玉兴）
