    San Hao Base Point
    Preparing to Plant Radishes
    [This Newspaper's Report] The San Hao village base point in the 11th district of Ci County includes nine villages, with a total of 18,457 mu of dry land. Most of it was planted in a rush after the last rainfall, and 12,625 mu have now sprouted, accounting for two-thirds of the total dry land area. The remaining one-third did not sprout due to insufficient rain, and methods for planting drought-resistant varieties are currently being studied. More than 2,000 mu of both paddy and dry land damaged by the hailstorm a few days ago have now been replanted. Only a small amount of land remains, where radishes are being prepared for planting.

    准备点萝卜
    【本报讯】磁县十一区三郝村基点共九个村，计有旱地一万八千四百五十七亩，上次下雨突击抢种大部都已种上，现已成苗的一万二千六百二十五亩，占全旱地面积三分之二，下余三分之一因雨小未成苗，刻正研究点种旱种办法。前几天遭受雹灾打坏的二千余亩水旱地，现在也都已补种上了，仅留的少数地正准备点种萝卜。（磁县生产通讯小报）
