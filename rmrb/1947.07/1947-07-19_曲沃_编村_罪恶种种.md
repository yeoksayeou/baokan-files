阎锡山's first rope for slaughtering the people was "village grouping." The "village group leader" was the chief culprit in ruling the people, and all exorbitant taxes were handled by him. Next were the "village platoon leader," "village squad leader," and other murderers. Especially vicious were the "village special agents" who worked as spies. These murderers were loyal dogs trained by Yan Xishan for a long time. They squeezed the people dry, so the people called them "oil presses." The people of Quwo shouted the slogan of self-salvation: "To turn over, kill the 'village groupings'; to liberate, kill the 'oil presses'!" The village special agents also stipulated that all villagers had the obligation to be "interviewed," that is, if he saw a woman from any family who was good-looking, he would invite her for a private talk and insult her at will. Therefore, many women died as a result of his "interviews." A woman in Hancun hanged herself as soon as she entered her house after being "interviewed."

In order to maintain Yan Xishan's bloody rule, "village grouping" spared no effort to organize the people into groups for conscription. Whenever they reached a village, all men between the ages of seventeen and forty-seven had to be grouped. Every three people were a group, two as National Soldiers and one as Regular Soldier. The common people were no longer willing to be cannon fodder for them and tried to escape. But the murderers came up with a lottery method, forcing you onto the road to death. Whoever was caught had to go. After the first group was drafted, the second group was drafted, and the third group, endlessly. If you didn't want to go, you could pay a sum of money. Once or twice you could pay your way out, but the third and fourth times came without end, and even old men had to be drafted. The young and strong men in each village were all taken away, and the families were ruined. The people of Quwo said: "It's no good to combine soldiers and farmers; all that grows in the fields is grass," "The National Soldier regiment is a human trafficker, and every family's wife has no husband." Last November, Tang from the city cut off one of his hands to avoid being drafted, but he was still imprisoned and died in the West Prison. Zhang Fuji from Dongguan jumped from a building and broke his legs and arms because he didn't want to be drafted. Liu Tianfu's wife went crazy because her son was drafted. There are countless similar tragedies.

After the grouping had taken away most of the young and strong men, the land was barren, but the village grouping still squeezed the people in every possible way according to Yan Xishan's instructions. In just half a year last year, they extorted from the people a military grain tax of one tael of silver per 1.8 dou, five catties of cotton, one zhang of cloth, and forty pairs of socks, not including other miscellaneous levies. The 220 large and small businesses in Quwo city were forced to pay 1,440 shi of wheat, and three times they were forced to pay 21 million yuan. The Yuncheng Tax Bureau extorted 6 million yuan. From July to December, the business tax was 31.6 million yuan, and the public funds were 39.39 million yuan. With such a huge number, even the largest stores would be forced to close. By the time our army liberated the city this year, only 110 stores were left, and the shelves were empty. Zhang Yucheng opened a small steamed bun shop and had to bear more than 800,000 yuan a year, plus 320,000 yuan for grouping funds. He had to mortgage the shop to others and wander the streets begging for food. In addition to arbitrarily apportioning taxes to the people, the "village groupings" also imposed nearly a hundred kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies. A small oil vendor complained: "Selling oil is not enough to make a living, and the 'village grouping' forcibly gave me a certificate, requiring me to donate 15 catties of oil every three months. Look, is there any way for poor people to survive?" Take the slaughter tax in the city as an example, every catty of mutton sold must be taxed eighty yuan. In addition, Yan Xishan copied the Japanese invaders' set of "strengthening rule" methods and levied a photo tax. The "village grouping" ordered all men and women in the villages over the age of twelve to take photos, and each photo cost one thousand yuan.

After Quwo City was liberated on April 15, the 110,000 people of the county enthusiastically rose up to fight the "oil presses" and "village groupings," and the voice of "To turn over, kill the village groupings; to liberate, kill the oil presses" resounded everywhere.

    曲沃“编村”罪恶种种
    阎锡山屠杀人民的第一条绳子便是“编村”。“编村长”是统治人民的祸首，凡苛捐杂税均经其手。其次便是“村连长”、“村排长”、“村班长”等凶手。尤其是作特务工作的“村特派员”，更是凶狠。这些凶手均是经过阎锡山长期训练的忠实走狗，他们将人民压榨得皮干肉净，因此人民称之为“油房”。曲沃人民喊出自救的口号：“要翻身，杀‘编村’，要解放杀‘油房’。”村特派员并规定凡村民皆有被“约谈”的义务，即是他看到谁家的妇女好，便约来个别谈话，任其侮辱，因此在其“约谈”下而死的妇女不知有多少。韩村有个妇女被“约谈”后，刚进家门便上吊而死。
    “编村”为维持阎锡山的血腥统治，不惜用一切办法把人民编组抓丁。每至一村，凡年在十七至四十七岁的男子，都得编组。每三人为一组，两个为国民兵，一个为常备兵。老百姓已经不甘为其当炮灰，设法逃避。但凶手们又想出了抓阄的办法，赶着你走上死路，抓住谁谁就得去。第一组编走了，接着就编第二组，第三组，以至无穷。如不愿去，可以钱抵。一次两次抵过了，但三次、四次不断头的来了，甚至老头子也要被抓上。各村的青壮年被拔完了，家也破产了。曲沃人民说：“兵农合一好，地里长的尽是草”，“国民兵团人贩子，家家媳妇没汉子”。去年十一月，城内唐某因逃避编组而自动砍断了一只手，可是仍被押进西大狱囚死。东关张复计不愿编组，而跳楼将腿和臂全部折坏，刘天福妻因其子被编组而气疯了。诸如此类的惨状不胜枚举。
    编组将大部青壮都拔走了，土地荒芜了，可是编村仍旧按照阎锡山的指示百计搜刮人民。仅去年半年中，即向人民勒索军粮每两银一石八斗，棉花五斤，布一丈，袜子四十双，其他零派不在内。曲沃全城大小商号二百二十余家，便出麦子一千四百四十石，款子三次出了二千一百万元，运城税务局勒索六百万元。七月至十二月，营业税三千一百六十万元，公款三千九百三十九万元。如此庞大的数字，再大的商店也要逼倒，至今年我军解放该城时，仅剩一百一十家了，而且架上货物已空。张玉成开着一个小馍铺，一年即负担八十余万元，另外出编组款三十二万元，只得将铺子抵押给人，在街上流浪讨饭。“编村”除姿意向人民摊派外，另外还有苛捐杂税将近百种。一个卖油小贩诉苦说：“咱卖油还不够生活，‘编村’又硬给我一张证明书，三个月要捐油十五斤，你看，穷人还有活路吗？”就拿城内的屠宰税来说，每卖一斤羊肉，便须捐八十元。另外，阎锡山抄袭日寇一套“统治强化”的办法，征收照像税，“编村”勒令各村凡年在十二岁以上的男女都得照像，每照一次，就得出一千元。
    曲沃城于四月十五日解放后，全县十一万人民轰轰烈烈的起来斗“油房”“编村”，到处掀起“要翻身，杀编村，要解放，杀油房”之声。（太岳分社）
