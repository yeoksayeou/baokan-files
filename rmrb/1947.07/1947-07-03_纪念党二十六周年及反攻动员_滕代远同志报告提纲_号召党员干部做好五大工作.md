Commemorating the Party's Twenty-Sixth Anniversary and Mobilizing for Counter-Offensive
　　Comrade Teng Daiyuan's Report Outline
　　Calls on Party Members and Cadres to Do Five Major Tasks
　　I. The New Period of the Chinese Party Has Arrived
　　Today is the 26th anniversary of our Party, and it is also the eve of the high tide of the national anti-imperialist and anti-feudal New Democratic movement. The time for the great counter-offensive is ripe, and the Party is in a new era more magnificent than any period in history. In just thirty-six years, China has gone through three major revolutions: the first was the Xinhai Revolution, the second was the Great Revolution from 1925 to 1927, and the third was the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression. However, none of these three completely accomplished the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal New Democratic revolutionary tasks. Now is the fourth time. This time, under the sole leadership of our Party and the wise guidance of Chairman Mao, we will bravely advance, work hard, and greet victory. We dare to win, and we will surely be able to win. All the subjective and objective conditions for victory are already in place.
　　The Party of twenty-six years has become an unprecedentedly large national party. As Chairman Mao required in the inaugural speech of "The Communist" in 1939, it has become a national model, a broad mass-based, ideologically and politically completely consolidated Bolshevik party, with millions of members. A year ago, we had two million members, and now we have far exceeded that number. According to statistics, in the Jin-Cha-Ji area, with a population of more than 10 million, there are 800,000 Party members; in our area, there are 670,000 Party members, totaling 1.5 million. We have nearly two million troops and a vast liberated area with a population of 140 million, including 21 administrative provinces, which has completely solved the land problem. In terms of population, it is more than 25 times larger than Bulgaria under the leadership of Comrade Dimitrov, and also larger than the United States. The liberated areas are interconnected. It takes almost two months to walk from Chairman Mao's base in northern Shaanxi to the Shandong liberated area without passing through any enemy strongholds, and even to northern Manchuria without passing through any Jiang-occupied areas, which shows its vastness. These are our subjective strengths, and we have become the most steadfast force in the new high tide.
　　In the twenty-six years of struggle, our Party has produced its most brilliant leader and mentor, Comrade Mao Zedong, and Mao Zedong Thought has become the guide for all our work. The history of the Party over the past twenty-six years proves that the political and military lines led by Comrade Mao Zedong have been consistently correct. Therefore, the Party Central Committee, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, is so brave, experienced, and astute that it can overcome all the twists and turns and difficulties on the road forward, guide the revolution to victory, and lead us to achieve such great victories in the year of patriotic self-defense war, bringing the new democratic high tide to an early arrival.
　　Comrades! Has there ever been such a powerful revolutionary force in the history of the Chinese Party as there is today? No; then are we still afraid that we cannot lead the current stage of China's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal New Democratic revolution to victory? The question is only "Do we dare to win?" As long as we resolutely want to win and are not afraid of victory, we can win. This is a conclusion that Lenin has already made.
　　Comrades! The Party, which has struggled for twenty-six years, has now reached its new and great period. On the occasion of the Party's twenty-sixth anniversary, the Party Central Committee has put forward the task of urgent action to the whole Party. This is the most glorious task of all of us Bolsheviks. Every Party member should contribute everything to complete this great mission to commemorate the birth of the Party. The Chinese people, who have been oppressed for thousands of years, will be liberated by our generation.
　　II. The Signs of the New Period
　　Chiang Kai-shek is facing unprecedentedly serious military, political, and economic crises, and is increasingly collapsing. The unprecedented awakening and fierce anti-Chiang political actions of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas, the great victories of the army and people in the liberated areas, and the favorable international situation are all signs of the new high tide. Can we say that our actions are adventurous? No. The rapid development of recent historical events proves that the analysis and guidance of the Party Central Committee are completely correct. If we hesitate and do not move forward, we will lag behind the development of the situation and become opportunists. Now, let's explain the current actual situation:
　　1. The Unprecedented Crisis of the Chiang Regime
　　A. Military Crisis. In the past year, nearly 100 brigades of Chiang's troops have been wiped out, especially the annihilation of Chiang's direct line main forces, the 74th Division, the 26th Division, the 71st Army, the 73rd Army, and the New 1st Army, and the main force of the 1st Division. This, coupled with the exhaustion of all reserve forces, has caused a decisive change in Chiang Kai-shek in both quality and quantity. In particular, the change in the quality of Chiang's army has become a fatal weakness in its quantity, causing a series of changes in Chiang's military front, completely bankrupting Chiang's strategy, and making his forces completely insufficient to allocate, forcing him to change from the full offensive strategy in the early stage of the war to a key offensive strategy, which is now gradually transforming into a key defensive strategy. Tactically, it has changed from a quick battle and quick resolution of fierce attacks to a steady attack and a steady attack, with strategic offense and tactical defense, to the current steady attack and steady attack. Although Chiang's army still maintains the designation of 211 brigades on the front line, less than 80 brigades are used for mobile operations on the front line. Shandong battlefield is the most concentrated, with only 32 brigades, and there are not many direct line main forces. Many troops can only be left in the rear for defense and cannot be used on the front line. Therefore, after we launched the summer offensive, Chiang Kai-shek has no power to fully restore the recovered areas, and the seesaw situation has ended in most areas. Chiang's military front is full of breaches and unable to rectify, and the offensive has weakened, which has caused a serious decline in the morale of Chiang's army, and many senior generals have lost confidence in combat. Recently, Tang Enbo resigned to Chiang Kai-shek due to the annihilation of the 74th Division in Menglianggu. Chiang ordered Guan Linzheng to take over, but Guan refused to take office because he had no confidence. Chiang had to temporarily appoint Fan Hanjie as acting. Chiang once planned to remove Chen Cheng and replace him with Gu Zhutong, but Gu also had no confidence and politely refused. Liu Zhi openly stated that the war situation had no future. Now, an anti-Chen movement is being launched within Chiang's army. Chen Cheng admitted at a high-level general meeting that more than 150 regimental commanders and above had been captured in ten months of combat (more than that!), and also stated that there was no solution. Chiang Kai-shek sometimes flew into a rage and sometimes shed tears. Some say that Chiang is somewhat mentally disturbed.
　　B. Political Crisis. Chiang Kai-shek's political credibility and deceptive methods have completely failed. Even Chiang Kai-shek's foreign father, the US Ambassador to China, Stuart Lei Deng, said that if this continues, he will definitely collapse in nine months. Middle-of-the-road figures unanimously believe that the Chiang regime will inevitably collapse. Li Jishen openly opposed Chiang, and Chiang Kai-shek had to rely on signing the Sino-US treasonous commercial treaty and further rely on special agent terror and slaughter to carry out his rule, but this will promote the accelerated awakening and action of the people. Dagongbao, in its editorial "Living and Peace", exclaimed: "The Chinese people have reached the point of no way out and will all take risks." This is the actual situation.
　　C. Economic Crisis. Within half a year, nearly three major economic fluctuations have occurred in the Chiang-controlled areas. The first was the gold rush in February, the second was the soaring prices in May, and the third was the malignant inflation and economic upheaval that broke out in late June. Now, the prices of all goods are unprecedentedly high. In Taiyuan, one yuan can buy four grains of rice. In Tianjin and Beijing, flour has increased tenfold in half a year, and one catty of wheat costs 2,800 yuan. The people generally cannot live, and industry and commerce are dying; American goods are flooding everywhere. The southwestern provinces have experienced unprecedented floods in a century, and more than 90 counties in Guangdong and Guangxi are full of victims. Now, even the civil servants of the Chiang government are forced to petition due to hunger.
　　The triple crisis of military, political and economic is intertwined, and Chiang Kai-shek has reached the point where he can no longer maintain his old rule.
　　2. The People's Democratic Patriotic Movement in Chiang-Occupied Areas is Unprecedentedly High
　　Within half a year, five great anti-Chiang incidents broke out in the Chiang-occupied areas: the Shen Chong incident in Beiping; the rice riots - the rice grabbing movement in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou, and the rice shops in Hangzhou have not yet fully recovered; the Taiwan riots, and the people rose up to seize power by force; civil unrest occurred everywhere, and according to available materials, it has spread to Jiangsu, Fujian, Anhui, Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Kang, Hunan, Hubei, Guizhou provinces; the May Fourth Movement of students across the country. These incidents really came one after another, which was unprecedented in the history of the Chiang family. Its characteristics are that it has a national scale, from economic struggle to political struggle, from petitions and demonstrations to armed uprisings to seize the Chiang family's power. The members who participated are unusually broad, from farmers, workers, clerks, students to industrial capitalists, university professors and Chiang Kai-shek's officers. Middle-of-the-road figures have shown a positive attitude. The people are fighting so bravely, which truly shows that the people in the Chiang-occupied areas have reached the point where they can no longer live as before. The second front has been widely established in the heart of Chiang Kai-shek, especially in Beijing and Shanghai, and it is now increasingly approaching and converging with the patriotic democratic upsurge in the liberated areas. When our People's Liberation Army launches a large-scale military advance into the Chiang-occupied areas, new incidents will not know how to develop!
　　3. The army and people in the liberated areas are getting stronger and stronger, and every front is winning battles, and most areas have taken the initiative.
　　Our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area alone eliminated more than 270,000 Chiang puppet troops in eleven months (the number of eliminated by the people's armed forces is not included), recovered and newly liberated more than 30 cities, and completely took the initiative. Most of the farmers have been liberated, and the feudal landlord class has been basically eliminated, only the problem of eliminating the remnants. In the liberated areas, for the first time in thousands of years, the historical task of eliminating feudalism was completed.
　　4. The international situation is also favorable to us.
　　The left-leaning of the people of the world, the success of the new democratic revolutions in Eastern Europe and Southeast Europe, the national movements in colonial countries, the strength of the Soviet Union, the opposition between American expansionism and all nations of the world, and the increasing isolation it has caused; especially the approach of the American economic crisis, these have determined that American reactionaries cannot immediately launch a third world war. There are also great difficulties in armed intervention in the Chinese democratic movement.
　　These are the historical conditions for the arrival of our anti-imperialist and anti-feudal new high tide.
　　III. The Tasks Given to Us by the Party in the Great Counter-Offensive
　　The general task of our entire Party and the entire Chinese people is to strive with all our strength to accelerate the arrival of the national new democratic revolutionary climax, and to fight for its complete victory.
　　Under this general task, our basic tasks, as pointed out in the Central Committee's "February 1st" instruction, are: 1. To launch a great counter-offensive with all our strength, and completely and thoroughly annihilate all invading Chiang troops; 2. To thoroughly complete land reform and liberate all the farmers in the newly recovered areas; 3. To resolutely implement financial and economic policies, practice production and thrift, guarantee war supplies, and support long-term war. This is a trinity task that our army and people in the liberated areas, especially our Communist Party members, must strive to complete.
　　In the face of this task, I propose the following work for all Party members and staff of the Central Direct, Border Direct, and Military Direct agencies:
　　(1) Deeply carry out political mobilization, requiring everyone to deeply understand the current political situation, recognize that completing the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal tasks and the great counter-offensive is our glorious task, recognize the infinite glory of dedicating ourselves to the cause of people's liberation, recognize the twists and turns that may occur in the new situation and the difficulties in the advance, and also recognize the inevitability of its victory. The decadent thoughts and the influence of landlord thoughts that remain in our Party must be eliminated. We should take this opportunity of the Party's twenty-sixth anniversary to improve our Party spirit. Therefore, I propose that starting from today, the Party's twenty-sixth anniversary, a study movement be launched in the directly affiliated organs, and then promote the universal progress of the entire region. This is our ideological preparation for the great counter-offensive and striving for great victory.
　　(2) Strengthen business work, strengthen investigation and research, improve work efficiency, ensure and organize the implementation of combat tasks, ensure the completion of the task of supporting the front line, and participate in and promote the implementation of land reform.
　　(3) Complete the streamlining of troops and administration. This is a streamlining in the midst of great development, starting from an active meaning, in order to strengthen the combat effectiveness of the front line, and to adapt to the conditions of the people's burden and support long-term war.
　　(4) Practice production, frugality and prepare for famine.
　　(5) Continue to deepen and universally carry out the great counter-offensive meritorious service movement.
　　Today is the 26th anniversary of the Party, and it is also the mobilization and preparation for our great counter-offensive. We require all Party members to actively work hard, work diligently, be prudent and not arrogant, unite around the Party Central Committee Chairman Mao, unite under the leadership of the Central Bureau, and bravely advance towards the general goal of victory!

### 纪念党二十六周年及反攻动员　滕代远同志报告提纲　  号召党员干部做好五大工作

　　纪念党二十六周年及反攻动员
  　滕代远同志报告提纲
　  号召党员干部做好五大工作
  　一、中国党的新时期已经到来
    今天是我党二十六周年纪念日，也正是全国反帝反封建新民主主义民主运动高潮的前夜。大反攻的时机已经成熟，党处在比历史上任何时期更伟大的新时代。中国在短短三十六年中，已经过了三次大革命：第一次是辛亥革命，第二次是一九二五至一九二七年的大革命，第三次是抗日民族革命战争。但这三次均未彻底完成反帝反封建的新民主主义革命任务，现在是第四次，这次任务在我党单独领导和毛主席英明指导之下，勇敢前进，努力奋斗，迎接胜利；我们敢于胜利，我们就一定能够胜利。一切胜利的主客观条件已经具备。
    二十六年的党，已经成为空前壮大的全国性的大党，它正如毛主席于一九三九年共产党人发刊词上所要求的，已经成为一个全国模范的，广大群众性的，思想上，政治上完全巩固的布尔塞维克的共产党，它已拥有数百万党员。一年前我们有二百万党员，现在已远超过这个数目。据有统计的，晋察冀区一千多万人口中，就有八十万党员；我区党员六十七万，共一百五十万。我们有近两百万的军队，和拥有一万万四千万人口，包括二十一行政省地区的广大解放区，彻底解决了土地问题。就人口来说，它大于季米特洛夫同志领导的保加利亚二十五倍以上，也大于美国。解放区之间是互相连通的，从毛主席所在的陕北到山东解放区，几乎步行要走两个月，完全不经过什么敌人据点，甚至到东北的北满也是完全不经过蒋占区，可见其辽阔。这些就是我们的主观力量，我们已成为新的高潮的最中坚的力量。
    二十六年奋斗中，我们党已产生了自己最英明的领袖和导师毛泽东同志，毛泽东思想已成为我们一切工作的指针。二十六年来党的历史，证明毛泽东同志所领导的政治路线军事路线是一贯正确的，因而现在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央是这样勇敢，有经验，机敏，能够克服前进道路上的一切曲折困难，引导革命走向胜利，领导我们在一年爱国自卫战争中取得如此伟大的胜利，使新民主主义高潮提早的到来。
    同志们！中国党的历史上有什么时候能象有今天这样强大的革命力量呢？没有的；那么我们还怕不能把中国现阶段的反帝反封建的新民主主义革命导向胜利吗？问题只在“我们敢不敢胜利”。只要我们坚决的要胜利，不怕胜利，我们就能胜利，这是列宁早已作了的结论。
    同志们！奋斗二十六年的党，今天已到了它新的伟大时期，党中央已在这二十六周年之际，向全党提出了紧急行动的任务，这是我们全体布尔塞维克最光荣的任务，我们每个党员应该贡献自己的一切来完成这个伟大的使命，以纪念党的诞生。中国几千年被压迫的人民，将要由我们这一代来解放。
    二、新时期的标志
    蒋介石已面临军事、政治、经济空前严重的危机，已日趋于崩溃，蒋管区人民空前的觉悟和猛烈反蒋的政治行动，解放区军民的伟大胜利和际国形势的有利，这些就是新高潮的标志。我们能说我们的行动是在冒险吗？不能。最近历史事变发展的迅速，证明党中央的分析和指导是完全正确的，我们如犹豫不前，就会落后于形势发展之后，成为机会主义。现在就当前的实际形势加以说明：
    一、蒋政权的空前危机
    甲、军事危机  一年来，蒋军被歼近一百个旅，特别是其嫡系主力整七十四师、整二十六师、七十一军、七十三军及新一军，整一师主力的被歼，加上后备兵力全部用尽，使蒋介石在质与量两方面，产生决定性的变化，特别是蒋军质的变化成为其量致命的弱点，引起了蒋军战线一系列的变化，使蒋军的战略完全破产，兵力完全不够分配，被迫由战争初期的全面攻势战略，变为重点攻势战略，现在正在逐渐转变为重点防御战略。在战术上则由猛打猛攻的速战速决，到战略进攻战术防御的稳扎猛打，到现在的稳扎稳打。现在蒋军前线虽然还保持二百十一个旅的番号，但用于第一线机动作战的不到八十个旅。山东战场集中得最多，也只三十二个旅，而嫡系主力更是不多，许多部队都只能留于后方守备，不能用于第一线。所以我们发动夏季攻势以后所收复的地区，蒋介石已没力量来全部恢复，拉锯的形势在大部分地区已经终止。蒋军战线到处决口，无力整顿，攻势已衰弱，这引起蒋军士气严重低落，许多高级将领丧失战斗信心。最近汤恩伯因孟良崮整七十四师被歼向蒋介石辞职，蒋令关麟征接任，关无信心坚不就职，蒋只得以范汉杰暂代。蒋曾拟撤陈诚职务以顾祝同代替，顾亦无信心，婉言拒绝。刘峙公开表示战局无前途。现在蒋军内部正在开展一个倒陈运动。陈诚在某一高级将领会议上承认十个月作战，被俘团长以上将领一百五十余人（何止此数！），亦表示无办法。蒋介石则时而暴跳如雷，时而下泪，有人说蒋有些神经失常。
    乙、政治危机　蒋介石的一切政治信誉和欺骗手段完全破产，连蒋介石的洋爸爸美国驻华的大使司徒雷登，也表示如此下去九个月一定垮台。中间人士一致认为蒋政权必垮无疑，李济琛公开反蒋，蒋介石不得不依靠签订中美卖国商约，进一步依靠特务恐怖屠杀来进行统治，但这将促进人民加速的觉悟和行动。大公报在“活与和”的社论中，惊呼：“中国人民已到了走头无路的程度，均将挺而走险”。这是实际情形。
    丙、经济危机　半年内蒋管区已发生近三次巨大的经济波动。一次是二月的黄金潮，一次是五月的物价狂涨，一次是恶性通货膨胀和经济大波动，已于六月下旬爆发。现在各物空前高昂，太原一元钱买四粒米，平津面粉半年涨了十倍，小麦一斤两千八百元，人民普遍不能生活，工商业奄奄一息；美货则到处泛滥。西南诸省则发生百年来空前的大水灾，两广九十多个县灾民遍地。现在连蒋政府的公务人员为饥饿所逼，亦不得不起来请愿。
    军事政治经济的三重危机交加，蒋介石已到了不能维持其旧统治的程度了。
    二、蒋占区人民民主爱国运动空前高涨
    半年之内蒋占区爆发了五件伟大的反蒋事件：北平沈崇事件；米骚动——京沪杭的抢米运动，至今杭州米店尚未完全恢复，台湾暴动，人民起来武装夺取政权；民变四起，据已有材料，已遍及苏、闽、皖、粤、桂、赣、川、康、湘、鄂、黔诸省；红五月的全国学生运动。这些事件真是接踵而来，为蒋家历史上所没有的，其特点是具有全国性规模，从经济斗争进到政治斗争，从请愿示威进到武装起义夺取蒋家政权。其参加的成员异常广泛，从农民、工人、小职员、学生到工业资本家、大学教授和蒋介石的军官。中间人士已表现了积极的态度。人民如此勇敢斗争，真正说明了蒋占区人民已到了不能照旧生活下去的程度了。第二条战线已在蒋介石腹心区特别是京沪广泛建立起来，现已与解放区的爱国民主高潮日益接近汇合。当我人民解放军向蒋占区大举进军时，新的事变将不知如何的发展！
    三、解放区军民愈战愈强，每条战线都在打胜仗，大部分地区已掌握了主动权。
    我晋冀鲁豫一个区，即在十一个月内消灭了蒋伪军二十七万以上（人民武装消灭数目未计在内），收复与新解放城市卅余座，完全掌握主动权。农民则大部分已获得解放，封建地主阶级基本上已消灭，只是肃清残余问题。在解放区内，千百年来首次完成消灭封建的历史任务。
    四、国际形势亦对我有利。
    世界人民的左倾，东欧、东南欧各国新民主主义革命的成功，殖民地国家的民族运动，苏联的强大，美国扩张主义与世界各民族的对立，日益造成其孤立；特别美国经济危机的逼临，这些都决定了美国反动派不可能即刻掀起第三次大战。武装干涉中国民主运动亦有极大困难。
    这些就是我们反帝反封建新高潮到来的历史条件。
    三、大反攻中党所给我们的任务
    我们全党及全中国人民的总任务，即是全力争取全国性新民主主义革命高潮的加速到来，及为其彻底胜利而斗争。
    在这一总任务之下，我们的基本任务正如中央“二一”指示所指出的是：一、全力发动大反攻，彻底干脆歼灭所有进犯的蒋军；二、彻底完成土地改革，解放一切新收复区的农民；三、坚决执行财政经济政策，厉行生产节约，保证战争供应，支持长期战争。这是三位一体的任务，是我们解放区军民，特别我们共产党员必须努力完成的。
    我们中直、边直、军直的全体党员、工作人员，在这任务面前，我提出下列工作：
    （１）深入进行政治动员，要求每个人深刻认识当前的政治形势，认识完成反帝反封建任务和大反攻是我们光荣任务，认识献身人民解放事业的无限光荣，认识新形势中可能发生的曲折及前进中的困难，又认识其胜利的必然性。对于在我们党内所残存的蜕化思想和地主思想的影响，必须肃清。我们应际此党的二十六周年之时，将我们的党性锻炼提高一步。因此，我提议从今天党的二十六周年纪念日起，在直属机关开展一个学习运动，并进而推动全区普遍进行。这就是我们大反攻，争取大胜利的思想准备。
    （２）加强业务工作，加强调查研究，提高工作效率，保障和组织战斗任务的进行，保证支援前线任务的完成，参加和推动土地改革的贯彻实现。
    （３）完成精兵简政。这是大发展中的精简，是从积极意义出发的，是为了加强前线的战斗力，而又适应人民负担条件和支持长期战争。
    （４）厉行生产节约备荒。
    （５）继续深入和普遍开展大反攻立功运动。
    今天是党的二十六周年纪念，又是我们大反攻的动员和准备，我们要求全体党员积极努力，安心工作，兢兢业业，戒骄戒燥，团结在党中央毛主席，团结在中央局领导之下，向着胜利的总目标奋勇前进！
