Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 10th: Geneva - At the meeting of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe on the afternoon of the 8th, the Soviet representative vehemently criticized the report by the British and French representatives regarding the separate European conference to be held by Britain and France on July 12th. He accused this policy of aiming to interfere in the internal affairs of European countries and attempting to control the European economy. He declared that the Soviet Union would never participate in such an erroneous policy.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 10th: TASS, London - The true intentions of Britain and France regarding the Paris "European Conference" on July 12th are often frankly revealed in the commentaries and news from the British newspapers and news agencies. For example, an editorial in the "Observer" on the 6th stated: "The provisions of the Marshall Plan and the current situation in Europe require efforts to establish cooperation in ensuring the economic unity of Europe. If we insist on maintaining the principle of complete non-interference in national sovereignty, this effort cannot succeed. A program for the comprehensive development of the European economy requires European countries to subject their economies to a general continental plan. In other words, it requires economic and financial integration." These words reveal that Bevin and Bidault's economic program at the July 12th meeting is to require the economies of European countries to submit to a general "continental plan," meaning that the United States wants to use Bevin and Bidault's help to use "economic aid" to control the economies of European countries. On the 7th, the "Observer's" Paris correspondent stated: A French Foreign Ministry official spokesperson, in response to his question regarding the promise of the "leadership committee" not to interfere in the internal affairs of various countries, said: "If the committee does not pay attention to the current situation in Europe, its existence would be meaningless." The word "attention" reveals that the July 12th meeting is only for European countries to listen to matters "pre-determined" by Britain and France. At the same time, the diplomatic commentators of the British news agencies used a warning tone to Sweden and Switzerland, saying that they must not use the excuse of "traditional neutrality" not to participate in the European conference, nor can they participate with any reservations. These situations show that Britain and France are still using intimidation and pressure on some countries.

    联合国欧洲经委会举行会议
    苏代表猛抨英法政策
    斥责他们肆意干涉各国内政
    【新华社陕北十日电】日内瓦讯：八日下午，联合国欧洲经济委员会举行会议，苏代表猛烈抨击英法代表关于英法于七月十二日单独召开欧洲会议之报告。指责这一政策旨在干涉欧洲各国内政、企图控制欧洲经济。并声明苏联决不参与此种错误政策。
    【新华社陕北十日电】塔斯社伦敦讯：从英国报纸与通讯社的评论与消息中，常常坦白的泄露出英法对七月十二日巴黎“欧洲会议”的真正意图。例如“观察家”报六日的社论中称：“马歇尔计划中的条款及欧洲的现状，要求在保证欧洲的经济统一中，努力建立合作。假如我们坚持保持完全不触及国家主权的原则，此种努力就不能获得成功。全面发展欧洲经济的纲领，要求欧洲各国将其经济服从总的大陆计划。换言之，它要求经济与财政的合并。”这些话泄露了贝文及皮道尔在七月十二日会议中的经济纲领，就是要求欧洲各国的经济服从总的“大陆计划”，也就是说美国要借贝文及皮道尔之助，利用“经济援助”以控制欧洲各国的经济。七日“观察家”报驻巴黎记者称：法国外交部官方发言人答复他有关允诺“领导委员会”不干涉各国内政时谓：“如果委员会对欧洲现状不予注意，那它的存在就毫无意义。”这种“注意”的字眼，泄露出七月十二的会议，只是让欧洲各国听从英法“事先制定”的事情。同时，英国通讯社的外交评论员用警告的口吻，对瑞典、瑞士说，决不要借口“传统的中立”不参加欧洲会议，也不能采取任何的保留来参加。这些情形，显示英法对某些国家，还在施用恐吓与压力。
