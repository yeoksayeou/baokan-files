    Seize the Opportunity, Cadres Take the Lead in Organizing Temporary Large-Scale Mutual Aid:
    Gaoyi Achieves Success in Rushing Planting
    [This newspaper's Gaoyi dispatch] Gaoyi had its first rainfall in late June, about three or four fingers deep. The leadership immediately seized the opportunity and proposed organizing to rush planting quickly, leaving no acre of wasteland, no acre of barren land. The whole county launched a rush planting upsurge, and many households of the elderly and widowed, and households lacking labor, also generally planted. According to statistics from 42 villages in three districts, 23,284 mu of land were completely sown in seven days. The methods and experiences are as follows: 1. Organize temporary large-scale mutual aid for rush planting. In order to organize all labor and animal power into the rush planting effort, all labor (male and female) was organized into teams, livestock into pairs, and agricultural implements for sowing were also allocated and used under the unified coordination of the village production committee. After the rush planting was completed, the village uniformly divided the work according to the activity, and accounted for it according to the work points. For example, Wang Village in the Second District proposed to plant dry land first, then paddy fields, and give priority to planting for families of soldiers, the elderly and widowed. It also proposed three "unoccupied" positions for plows, seeders, and livestock, and scientifically calculated that three plows should be matched with one seeder. Livestock were lacking people to pull the roller, and cadres were assigned to each mutual aid team to do mobilization work. In three days, 1,300 mu were rushed planted. 2. Mutual assistance between groups for rush planting. This involved using mutual aid groups as units to mutually allocate labor and animal power to carry out rush planting, overcoming the past phenomenon of not caring for each other. Slogans such as "If we don't plant, we can't harvest, and everyone suffers" and "Rush planting requires mutual assistance, and everyone benefits from the harvest of grain" were put forward to organize rush planting. For example, at the group leader meeting in Li Village, Third District, it was proposed that farmers are always one family, and rush planting cannot leave one family behind, and it was guaranteed that no other work would be done until the seedlings were in the ground. For example, if groups such as Dong Xintai's group had no barren land, they immediately went to groups such as Liu Fengtang's group to work, completing 500 mu of sowing in two days. This was done in areas such as Dongmaxian and Macun in the Third District. 3. Seize the opportunity and cadres take the lead. Taking advantage of the rain, and seizing the peasants' concerns about not being able to plant, the cadres went deep into a group and an area, educating the masses and pointing out that everyone would be delayed if they did their own thing, and if they did not plant today, they would go hungry in the autumn, so that the peasants would consciously organize rush planting. For example, the mutual aid group in Dongyitou Village was once depressed, but after the cadres went deep into the organization and enlightened them, all the groups in the village took action in the rush planting. For example, the group led by Shi Xiaolin (vice chairman of the farmers' association) was reorganized at the common request of the group members for rush planting, and the past wage issues and other problems of the group were resolved, and the entire group's 30 mu of barren land was planted in five days. The whole county is now organizing the masses to continue planting and weeding. (Feng Ke)
    [This newspaper's Lincheng dispatch] Guan Deng Village had rain on July 2nd, but the masses' enthusiasm for cultivation was not great. The masses had three thoughts: 1. They wanted to cultivate the land once before planting; 2. They were afraid that the seedlings would grow together and could not be weeded; 3. There were few seeders in the village, and not enough livestock. After the leadership understood these ideas, they convened a mass meeting that night to discuss and mobilize rush planting, proposing to borrow seeders from other villages and adjust livestock. They were afraid that the seedlings would be difficult to manage later, so they mobilized the masses from other villages to support them, guaranteeing that no seedlings would be left unplanted. After the meeting, most of the masses were mobilized, borrowing 14 seeders that night, and there were 53 in the village. By the third day, men, women, and children were all involved in the rush planting upsurge, rushing to plant 12 qing of land in one day. (Hong Shan)

    抓紧时机干部带头组织临时大互助
    高邑抢种获成绩
    【本报高邑讯】高邑于六月下旬落了第一场雨，约三、四指，领导上即抓紧提出组织起来快抢种，不留一亩荒地，不剩一亩白地，全县展开了抢种热潮，好些孤寡户和缺少劳力户也普遍种上。据三个区四十二村的统计，前后七天中二万三千二百八十四亩地完全下种，作法与经验如下：一、组织临时抢种大互助。为使一切劳畜力都组织到抢种中来，将所有的劳力（男女）编成队，牲口编成犋，下种用的农具，也配置起来，统一由村生产委员会调动使用。抢种完后，由村中统一按活订分，按工算帐。如二区王村抢种中提出先种旱，后种水，先给抗属、孤寡户种，并提出了犁、耧、牲口三不闲，科学计算，三张犁配一个耧，牲口缺少人拉砘，每一互助队内配备干部做鼓动工作。三天中抢种一千三百亩。二、组与组互助抢种。是以互助组为单位，互相调拨劳畜力突击抢种，克服了过去互不管的现象，提出了种不上打不下大家吃亏，突击抢种必需互助，打下粮食大家沾光等口号来组织抢种。如三区里村小组长会上提出农民什么时候也是一家，抢种不能把一家剩等口号，并保证按不上苗种不上地不干别的活等，如董新泰等组没有白地，马上就到刘凤堂等组去干，两天完成五百亩下种。在三区如东马闲、马村等都是这样作。三、抓住时机干部起带头作用。利用抢晌雨，抓住农民怕种不上的顾虑，干部深入一小组和一片，教育群众指出各干各都耽误，今天种不上，秋后饿肚肠，来使农民自觉组织抢种。如东驿头村互助组，曾一度消沉，经过干部深入组织启发，在抢种中全村各组行动起来。如史小林（农会副主任）领导的小组，在组员共同要求抢种中，又重新组织起来，并解决了该组过去的工资问题和其他的疙瘩，五天中将全组三十亩白地种完。现全县正组织群众继续下种和锄苗中。（冯克）
    【本报临城讯】管等村在七月二号落了雨，但群众耕种劲头不很大，群众有三种想法：一、愿意把地耕一遍才种；二、怕苗一起长锄不了；三、村中耧少，牲口不够用。领导上了解了这些想法后，当天晚召集了群众大会，讨论动员抢种，提出从外村借耧调剂牲口，怕苗难以后发动外村群众支援，保证荒不了苗。会后绝大部分群众动员起来，当天夜里借耧十四张，本村有五十三张，到第三天男、女、儿童都卷入抢种热潮，一天即抢种地十二顷。（洪山）
