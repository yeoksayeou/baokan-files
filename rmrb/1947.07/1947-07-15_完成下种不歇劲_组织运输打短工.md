Finish Planting Without Stopping
    Organize Transportation, Do Odd Jobs

    [Reported by this newspaper] After finishing planting in the Ninth District of Xingtai, the masses said: The work is lighter, we should take a break! Some also said: Let's start a small-scale cooperative! After learning about these thoughts, Ma Biao Ping, a labor hero, mobilized each group to send one person outside to inquire about suitable jobs. At the same time, he made precise calculations of his own group's farm work. He took out three livestock and two people to transport goods to Xingtai City once. The round trip took three and a half days and earned 17,000 yuan, which could buy eight and a half dou of corn, enough for the group of 49 people to eat for five and a half days. Upon returning, he immediately convened a meeting of group leaders. After using this practical achievement to conduct ideological mobilization through accounting, everyone believed that it was necessary to organize the surplus labor to transport and do odd jobs. Now the whole village has formed three teams, totaling twenty-five people. Five people went to Shanxi to do odd jobs, eighteen people are transporting, and two people are sawing wood. Everyone decided to exchange the money earned for grain in Shanxi, and they also collected eighty jin of cloth to exchange for grain in Shanxi.

    组织运输打短工
    【本报讯】邢台九区后掌完成下种后，群众说：活闲了，可得歇歇哩！还有的说：干小型社吧！劳英马表平了解了以上思想后，一面动员各组抽一人去外面访问干啥合适，一面把自己组农活作了精确计算，抽出三个牲口两个人，往邢台城运了一次脚，来回三天半，共赚洋一万七千元，可买八斗半玉茭，够全组四十九口人吃五天半。回来即召开组长会，用这次实际成绩，进行了算帐的思想动员后，大家都认为只有组织剩余劳力，运输打短工。现全村已组成三个队，共二十五个人，到山西打短工的五人，运输的十八人，拉锯的二人，大家决定赚下钱到山西换成粮食，集中了八十斤布，也要到山西换成粮食。
