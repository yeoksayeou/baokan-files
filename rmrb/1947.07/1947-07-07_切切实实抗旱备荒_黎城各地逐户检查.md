　　Resolutely Fight Drought and Prepare for Famine
　　Licheng Inspects Every Household

[Report from our newspaper in Licheng] In commemoration of "July 1st," various districts in Licheng are conducting ground-level, household-by-household inspections of production, thrift, drought resistance, and famine preparedness. On June 27th, the Xibaoyu base point in the Fourth District convened a conference of over a hundred village cadres, model heroes, mutual aid team leaders, and activists, focusing on comprehensive inspections of hoeing, thrift, drought resistance, and famine relief work by sector and household. The inspection results showed that: Villages such as Beima and Jinqu paid attention to technology. In the spring, they harrowed the land once, implemented edge-cultivation and edge-planting, and planted horizontally and vertically, planting as they cultivated. The millet seedlings are relatively uniform. Jinqu hero Yang Jiangping took advantage of the situation to plant millet first and then plant corn. The seedlings on twenty-two mu all took root, but most of the late-planted fields dried up and the seedlings did not survive. In terms of labor organization and utilization, Xibaoyu contracted work by mu. During the summer harvest and replanting, they broke down the waiting mentality and the contradiction between planting early and planting late. In other villages, thrift, famine relief, planting, replanting, and protecting autumn seedlings were not widespread and did not form a movement. After leadership mobilization, village cadres had a deep understanding of their responsibility to the masses. They reviewed the past estrangement between cadres and the masses. Liu Entang, a hero of Xibaoyu, said: "If the cadres don't pay close attention, the masses won't move. The higher authorities repeatedly called for planting, but I had a waiting mentality and didn't plant in time." As a result, the masses reflected, "If the seedlings don't take root, the cadres are to blame." Now they realize that their spirit of serving the masses was insufficient and that they had caused the masses to suffer by not listening to the government. From now on, they must work hard. They immediately formulated a drought resistance plan for Xibaoyu, requiring every household to mix one jin of corn with one jin of bran, eat soft rice, eat noodles no more than six times a month, and have women and children collect vegetables, storing ten jin of dried vegetables per person. The political directors of Langzhuang and Sidi also made plans, expressing their determination to listen to the government's call and follow the Communist Party. The Nanwei base point in the Fifth District reported on the planting and hoeing work of the entire base point at the drought resistance and famine preparedness conference. Guo Tianfu, the party branch secretary of Cheyuan Village, and Lu Jicai, the labor hero, introduced their village's experience in mobilizing the masses to prepare for famine: First, Guo Tianfu made his own production and thrift plan and presented it to the night school for the masses to discuss. Then, Lu Jicai made a plan for the whole group. When helping the masses make plans, they found that some people were unwilling to report their household grain reserves, fearing that they would overstate their income and understate their expenses. After calculating accounts based on last year's income and consumption and discussing the matter, this ideological problem was resolved. Then, through actual inspection, it was found that 115 out of the 205 households in the village were already mixing bran and vegetables into their meals. The village quickly made a plan, and a movement of thrift and famine preparedness took shape. During the discussion, it was also discovered that some villages were still very complacent, and individual cadres were ideologically resistant to thrift, resulting in serious waste. The leadership immediately combined this with current affairs, calling on everyone to examine their muddled thinking and commemorate "July 1st" by increasing production, practicing thrift, fighting drought, preparing for famine, and supporting the great counteroffensive, breaking the masses' complacent thinking of leaving things to fate and waiting for relief. Everyone said: "Don't forget the pain once the scar is healed. We must overcome hedonistic thoughts, specifically calculate accounts, and make long-term plans." (Chong Qi, Xin Wen, Jian Wen, Li Kaiyuan, Yue Zongdai, Kong Dexuan)

[Report from our newspaper in Shexian] The Shexian Third District Public Office is intensifying its inspection of famine preparedness and thrift in various villages. The District Public Office first decided to further reduce the standard of living, eat less white flour, mix more wild vegetables into rice, and for everyone not to smoke paper cigarettes. District cadres then conducted thorough inspections in Dongxi and Xishu, the stationed villages. Dongxi Xijie convened a symposium on the evening of June 30th, recalling the hardships of famine years, overcoming complacency, pessimism, reliance on the weather, waiting for relief, and eating borrowed grain. They decided on the spot to expand mutual aid teams, organize men to engage in transportation, women to spin thread and collect wild vegetables, and the elderly and children to collect firewood and carry water. Each household formulated a long-term famine relief plan based on existing grain reserves, mixing bran and vegetables to save on rice and flour. The Dongxi and Xishu Village Farmers' Association Cooperative has prepared dozens of jin of gourd radish seeds, registered and investigated the land of each mutual aid team, and prepared to plant and replant as soon as it rains. They also agreed not to steam steamed buns for visiting relatives. Currently, district and village cadres are separately helping the masses to formulate plans, and the cooperative is stepping up the organization of sideline industries such as transportation and textile, and coordinating late-season crop seeds.

　　切切实实抗旱备荒
  　黎城各地逐户检查
    【本报黎城讯】黎城各区纪念“七一”，逐地逐户检查生产节约抗旱备荒。四区西柏峪基点于六月二十七日召集各村干部英雄模范互助组长积极分子百余人的大会，集中分块逐地逐户全面检查锄苗节约抗旱渡荒工作。检查结果是：北马、斤曲等村讲究技术，春天时、普遍耙了一次地，实行了边耕沿种，顺耕横种、随耕随种的趁垧抢种办法，谷苗比较整齐，斤曲英雄杨江平趁垧先种谷后栽玉茭，二十二亩苗都捉住了，种的迟垧干，大多没捉住苗。在劳力组织使用上，西柏峪按亩包工，在夏收补种中打破了等待思想与先栽后栽的矛盾。其他各村节约渡荒，下种补种保护秋苗都不普遍，没有形成运动。经过领导上的动员，各村干部对群众负责有了深刻认识，检讨了过去干群间的隔阂，西柏峪英雄刘恩堂说：“干部抓不紧群众也不动，上级再三号召下种，自己存在等待思想，没有及时下种”。结果群众反映说：“捉不住苗，吃亏吃在干部身上。”现在才想到为群众服务精神不够，不听政府话让群众吃了亏，今后可得抓紧干，随即定出西柏峪的抗旱计划，每户普遍做到一斤玉茭掺一斤糠、米饭要吃软的，一月至多吃六次面，妇女儿童采菜，每人贮蓄十斤干菜。郎庄、寺底政治主任也都订出计划，表示要坚决听政府号召跟共产党走。五区南委的基点在检查抗旱备荒大会上，汇报了全基点的下种锄苗工作：车元村支部书记郭天福、劳英卢计财把自己村如何打通群众思想领导备荒的经验办法介绍给大家：首先郭天福订出自己生产节约计划、拿到夜校让群众讨论，跟着，卢计财订出全组计划。在帮助群众订计划时，发现有不愿意报家里存粮、订收入怕订多、开支怕订少的思想。经过按去年的收入、消耗具体算帐酝酿讨论，解决了这个思想问题；然后实际检查，全村二百零五户中已有一百十五户掺吃糠菜，很快就把全村计划订出，节约备荒形成运动。讨论中又发现有些村庄还很麻痹，个别干部思想上抵抗节约，浪费现象严重。领导上当即结合时事，号召大家检查糊涂思想，以生产节约抗旱备荒来纪念“七一”支援大反攻，打破了大家听天由命等救济的麻痹思想。人人都说：“不要好了疮疤忘了疼，一定要克服享乐思想，具体算帐，长期打算。”（崇岐、新文、建文、李开元、岳宗岱、孔德轩）
    【本报涉县讯】涉县三区区公所加紧检查各村备荒节约。区公所首先决定再进一步降低生活水平，少吃白面，吃米多掺野菜，全体不抽纸烟。区干部随即在驻地东西戍深入检查，西戍东街于六月三十日夜召开座谈会，回忆灾荒年的困苦，克服了麻痹、悲观、靠天吃饭、等救济、吃借粮等思想，当场决定扩大互助组，组织起来男人搞运输，女人纺花采野菜，老汉小孩拾柴抬水。各家按现有粮食定出掺糠掺菜省吃米面的长期渡荒计划。东西戍村农会合作社已准备了几十斤葫萝卜籽，登记调查各互助组土地，准备一下雨就抢种、抢补，并约定不蒸馍馍看亲戚。现区村干部正分别帮助群众订计划，合作社加紧组织运输、纺织等副业，调剂晚期作物种籽。（范直）
