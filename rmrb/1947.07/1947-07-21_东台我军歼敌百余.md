Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 18th. A unit of the Central China People's Liberation Army recovered Dingxi Town, 30 miles southwest of Dongtai, on the 13th, killing over 50 Chiang Kai-shek puppet soldiers, including a company commander, capturing 80 others, repelling a Chiang Kai-shek army regiment reinforcing them, and destroying three vehicles.
Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 15th. The Haidong District Team of Hai'men and Qidong counties achieved three victories in early June. With only three lightly wounded on our side, they annihilated and captured 74 Chiang Kai-shek puppet soldiers and seized all their weapons, earning the title of Armed Model Fighting Team of the Central Jiangsu District. Their successful operational experience is as follows: (1) From top to bottom, and from within the Party to outside the Party, repeatedly implement the determination to protect the interests of the masses who have turned over a new leaf. Use specific examples of the disasters suffered by the masses under Chiang Kai-shek's rule to repeatedly educate the soldiers through informal discussions. Furthermore, take advantage of the low morale of Chiang Kai-shek's troops and organize victorious attacks, using facts to eliminate concerns such as inexperience, poor equipment, and weak combat effectiveness, thereby enhancing confidence in victory. (2) Specifically grasp enemy intelligence, strictly maintain secrecy, and arrange ambush circles according to the terrain for each encampment. Conduct thorough investigations and research into the enemy situation at each stronghold around the area of operation, analyze operational conditions, and stipulate countermeasures for when large and small enemy units attack, ensuring that every soldier understands and grasps them thoroughly, striving for unity between superiors and subordinates.

　　东台我军歼敌百余
    【新华社华中十八日电】苏中人民解放军一部于十三日收复东台西南三十里之丁溪镇，毙蒋伪军中队长以下五十余人，俘八十余人，并击退增援蒋军一个团，毁汽车三辆。
    【新华社华中十五日电】海（门）启（东）县海东区队六月初旬六日三捷，以我轻伤三名而歼俘蒋伪七十四名，缴获全部武器，曾获苏中区级武装模范战斗的称号。其胜利作战经验如下：（一）自上而下，由党内而党外反复贯彻保卫群众翻身利益的决心，以群众所受蒋灾的具体事例，在战士中反复漫谈教育。更利用蒋伪士气低落，组织胜利出击，用事实消灭了没经验、装备差战斗力弱等顾虑，提高了胜利信心。（二）具体掌握敌情，严守秘密，每次宿营均按地形布置伏击圈。对活动地区周围每一据点的敌情作体体的调查研究，分析作战条件，规定大队与小队敌人来犯时之对策，使每个战士领会贯通，求得上下一致。
