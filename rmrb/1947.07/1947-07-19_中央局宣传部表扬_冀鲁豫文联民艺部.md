    The Central Bureau Propaganda Department Commends
    Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Federation of Literary and Art Circles Folk Arts Department
    The Folk Arts Department of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Federation of Literary and Art Circles has united artists from more than a dozen counties in the region, established an artist training class, enlightened the class consciousness of old artists, changed old mindsets, and rewritten new opera lyrics, enabling folk art to serve the people. Recently, in order to welcome the counter-offensive, combined with the Great Review (大复查), it is carrying out rectification and training, launching a campaign to establish models of meritorious service, and is working hard to study politics and culture. It is now compiling and performing new dramas and new lyrics that are combined with the Review and the counter-offensive. Because the department's work has been quite successful, the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau of the Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu Bureau of the Communist Party of China sent a letter of commendation, as follows:
    Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Party Committee Propaganda Department:
    Your work in transforming old artists is quite good and has achieved results. It should be commended, and it is hoped that you will continue your efforts and implement it thoroughly. Attention must be paid to promoting the excellent specialities of old artists, giving them political and artistic transformation on the basis of their existing artistic achievements, and moving towards the artistic direction of creating national forms and new democratic content.
      Sincerely,
    Bu Li          Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau of the Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu Bureau of the Communist Party of China
            June 22nd
