　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 17th: Comprehensive reports indicate that on June 3rd, the Congress Party, the Muslim League, and the Sikhs simultaneously accepted Mountbatten's draft plan for the partition of India. On the 4th of this month, the British government officially published the partition plan white paper, titled "Indian Independence Act."

　　It is reported that the "Indian Independence Act" stipulates: the establishment of two dominions, Hindustan and Pakistan, in India; a plebiscite to be held in the Northwest Frontier Province; the two autonomous regions to independently organize legislative, administrative, and defense institutions, determine the future Governor-General of India and the relationship between Britain and the dominions; the withdrawal of British troops from India; and August 15th as the date for the transfer of power.

　　After the announcement of the Indian partition plan, British officials generally held an optimistic attitude. However, since agreeing to the partition, the Congress Party and the Muslim League immediately became embroiled in new disputes, particularly regarding the demarcation of boundaries and the ownership of the Northwest Frontier Province. The political struggle between the two sides is exceptionally fierce.

　　Jinnah demanded that Pakistan include the entirety of Bengal and Punjab, plus Sindh, Balochistan, and the Assam provinces. The Congress Party put forward a counter-proposal, demanding that eastern Bengal (a Muslim-majority area) be划归 assigned to Pakistan, and southwestern Bengal (a Hindu-majority area) be assigned to Hindustan; southwestern Punjab (a Muslim-majority area) to Pakistan, and eastern Punjab (mainly Sikhs, but the Congress Party's influence is dominant in the area) to Hindustan.

　　According to the provisions of the new act, the Northwest Frontier Province will be decided by a plebiscite. The Congress Party opposes the plebiscite and is trying hard to get the Pathans to join Hindustan. This move by the Congress Party has been attacked by the Muslim League, and the Muslim League's representative in the Frontier Province, Khan, even stated that he would resolve the issue with "force." According to reliable sources, Britain is trying to get the Pathans to merge into Pakistan in order to facilitate the establishment of a military base in the area.

　　To date, the Boundary Commission has not put forward any concrete solutions, and the conflict between India and the Muslims is becoming increasingly intense. In mid-June, the Governor-General of India, accompanied by the Chief Minister of Punjab Province, went to the Sohna area to deploy suppression measures, but the situation in Sohna did not ease. On July 8th, a self-destructive event occurred in Calcutta, resulting in more than 300 casualties.

　　Regarding Britain's attempt to implement the Indian partition plan, Indian democrat Bora criticized it on June 10th, saying: "British imperialism has shown victory. Their policy of divide and rule for more than a hundred years has not changed to this day. If the two dominions of India and Pakistan are to become republics in the future, it will only be in name; they will inevitably rely on British assistance, which will perpetuate the conflict between India and the Muslims." Gandhi said in a speech on the 9th of this month: "Britain is very willing to turn India into an organized cockfighting arena and then leave."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 17th: Moscow dispatch: Deyakov recently wrote an article in Izvestia stating that the implementation of the British plan to split India will plunge India into chaos and a state of nominal independence; in reality, it will be completely under British rule. Even if some princely states declare complete independence, the British government can use the contradictions between religions and small princely states to provoke them and act as the supreme dictator. This plan will allow Britain to maintain its highest position in India economically and politically, which explains why Churchill, who has always opposed Indian independence, also supports this plan. The disintegration of India caused by the British plan has nothing in common with the national self-determination of the Indian people. On the contrary, at least for a certain period of time, it will greatly hinder the unity of the Indian people and increase the difficulty of striving for the country's true independence.

### 英对印分治计划正式公布　欲使印度分崩离析　国大回盟间陷入新纠纷

　　英对印分治计划正式公布
  　欲使印度分崩离析
  　国大回盟间陷入新纠纷
    【新华社陕北十七日电】综合报导：六月三日，国大党、回盟及锡克族同时接受了蒙古巴顿分治印度的计划草案。本月四日，英政府已将分治计划白皮书正式公布，名为“印度独立法案”。
    据悉“印度独立法案”规定：在印度成立印度斯坦及巴基斯坦两自治领，西北边区举行公民投票，两自治区自行组织的立法、行政和国防机构、确定未来印督及英国与自治领间的关系，英军撤离印度，同时规定八月十五日为移交政权的日期等。
    印度分治计划公布后，英官方咸抱乐观态度，但是国大党和回盟自同意分治以来，立即又陷入新的纠纷中，特别对于疆界的划分和西北边区谁属的问题，双方政争异常激烈。
    真纳要求巴基斯坦包括孟加拉、旁遮普全部加上信地、俾路支和阿萨蜜诸省。国大党提出了对案，要求孟省东部（回教徒多数区）划归巴斯基坦，西南部（印度教徒多数区）划归印度斯坦；旁省西南部（回教徒多数区）归巴基斯坦，东部（主要是锡克族，但国大党势力在该区占上风）归印度斯坦。
    根据新法案的规定，西北边区由公民投票决定；国大党反对公民投票，极力想使巴坦人参加印度斯坦。国大党此举遭到回盟的攻击，回盟边省代表康恩甚至表示要以“武力”解决。据可靠方面消息、英国力图使巴坦人归并巴基斯坦，以便于在该区建立军事基地。
    迄今为止，划界小组委员会尚未提出任何具体的解决方案，印回冲突却有日甚一日的趋势。六月中旬印督曾协同旁遮首省省长赴骚拿地区布置镇压措施，但骚拿未见缓和；七月八日加尔各答还发生伤亡达三百余名的自相残杀事件。
    对于英国采取印度分治计划之企图，印度民主人士波拉于六月十日曾有所抨击称：“英帝国主义表现胜利了，彼等一百余年来分而治之的政策，直到今天尚未有所改变。假如印、巴两自治领将来是共和国，这不过是名义上的；它们将不可免地互英国的援助，而使印回冲突继续下去。”甘地在本月九日的演辞中说：“英国十分同意使印度成为一有组织的两个斗鸡场，然后离去。”
    【新华社陕北十七日电】莫斯科讯：德也科夫顷在消息报撰文称：英国分裂印度计划的实现，将使印度陷于混乱和形式上独立的状态中；实际上则完全在英国统治之下，即使有一些土邦宣布完全独立，但是英国政府可利用宗教与弱小土邦间的矛盾，从中挑拨，并充当最高独裁者。此一计划将容许英国在印度保持在经济与政治上最高的地位，这就说明为什么向来反对印度独立的邱吉尔，也支持这一计划。英国计划所造成的印度分崩离析，与印度各民族的民族自决毫无共同之点。相反的，至少在一定时期内，它将大大的妨碍印度人民的团结，并为争取国家的真正独立增加困难。
