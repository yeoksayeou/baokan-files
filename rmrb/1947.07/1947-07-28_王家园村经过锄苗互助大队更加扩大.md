(This report from our correspondent in Taiyue, 26th) Wangjiayuan Village in Qinyuan County summarized its first hoeing efforts. A total of 204 people attended the meeting and jointly discussed the following points: First, labor was saved and labor efficiency was improved. The Mutual Aid Brigade has a total of 68 full laborers. Of these, 27 went to Hong and Zhao to harvest wheat, to Huoshan to dig medicinal herbs, and to participate in the war, or were sick. The remaining 41 full laborers hoed 222 mu of millet in 15 days, averaging 0.69 mu per work day. If there were no mutual aid, one worker could at most hoe 0.5 mu per day. Thanks to the leadership of village head Zhao Linbao, his group of 11 people hoed 9 mu of millet in one day, averaging 0.81 mu per person per day. In addition, 22 semi-laborers and women, after feeding pigs and handling odd jobs at home in the morning, went to the fields in the morning and afternoon to weed 184 mu of corn seedlings, using 88 work days. Two children's mutual aid groups of 17 people used their spare time before and after school to weed 43.5 mu of cornfields. The active participation of women and children greatly saved male full laborers. Second, improve technology and achieve "careful pulling and meticulous hoeing." The nine young people in the Mutual Aid Brigade were in a separate group. Later, in order to improve their skills, they were placed in adult groups, hoeing next to the adults, "learning as they hoed." During breaks, the adults taught and the young people asked questions. In order to correct shortcomings and praise good work at any time, a "row comparison" method was created, that is, looking back at the hoed rows. Those who hoed well were praised, and those who hoed poorly were corrected. In half a month, Zhao Linbao trained two young people. Furthermore, everyone provided advice during breaks, advocating "one heart" and opposing "two hearts," opposing hoeing well for oneself but poorly for others. Third, accurate calculations squeeze out surplus labor for sideline production to increase the income of the masses. According to calculations, in addition to hoeing, there were 445 surplus work days in half a month, freeing up 29 full laborers to engage in sideline production. Wang Fuhai and Wen San'er, experts in digging medicinal herbs from Houjiazhuang, organized eight people to dig medicinal herbs in Huoshan. Wang Genmu and others organized an eight-person wheat harvesting team to harvest wheat in Huo County and Zhaocheng. The two groups had a total of 13 surplus laborers and organized a mobile team, mainly to prepare for errands during the war, and to engage in sideline production or odd jobs near the village when not participating in the war. In half a month, the medicinal herb digging team only worked for three days due to rain and travel, earning 70,000 yuan, equivalent to 10 shi of millet. The wheat harvesting team earned a total of 30,400 yuan, equivalent to 4.5 shi of millet. Fourth, meticulous organization ensures that both production and participation in the war are not delayed. On the 23rd day of the fourth lunar month, eight villagers were going to participate in the war, but the autumn seedlings had to be hoed immediately, so they were very anxious. The Mutual Aid Brigade guaranteed them that their families' 28 mu of seedlings would all be hoed with everyone's joint efforts. Therefore, Wang Mingchen and Wang Xuanze, who were leaving to participate in the war, were so grateful that they automatically requested to join the Mutual Aid Brigade. Furthermore, Wang Wuhai and Wang Gennian were unable to work in the fields due to illness. Although they were not members of the Mutual Aid Brigade, the Mutual Aid Brigade hoed their seedlings as well. Therefore, as soon as Wang Gennian recovered from his illness, he also automatically joined the Mutual Aid Brigade. Now the Mutual Aid Brigade is growing bigger and bigger, and the bigger it gets, the more consolidated it becomes.

　　王家园村经过锄苗互助大队更加扩大
    【本报太岳二十六日电】沁源王家园总结第一次锄苗。到会群众共二百零四人，共同讨论出以下几点：第一、节省下劳力提高了劳动效率。互助大队全劳力共六十八人，除到洪、赵割麦、到霍山刨药材及参战害病等廿七人外，其余全劳力四十一人，十五天锄谷二百二十二亩，每工平均锄六分九厘，若不互助，一个工一天顶多能锄五分地，由于村长赵林宝带头，全组十一个人，一天就锄了九亩谷，每人一天平均能锄八分一。此外有廿二个半劳力和妇女，早上在家喂猪，安置零活，上下午到地拔了一百八十四亩玉茭苗，用工八十八个。两个儿童互助组十七人，利用上下午学习空余时间，上玉茭地拔苗四十三亩五分。由于妇女儿童的积极参加，大大节省了男全劳力。第二、提高技术，做到“精挽细锄”，互助大队中的九个青年，单独一组，后来为了提高他们的技术，便分开安插大人组里，锄苗时挨着大人，“随锄随指导”，休息下大人多教青年多问。又为了随时纠正缺点表扬好的，便创造了一种“相垄则”，即跟上锄过的垄则往回看的办法，锄的好的就给表扬，挽的差的即予纠正。前后半月，赵林保便培养出两个青年。再就是全组休息时，互相提供意见，提倡“一颗心”反对“两颗心”，反对给自己锄的好给别人锄的不好。第三、精确计算挤出剩余劳力，进行副业生产，增加群众收入。计算结果，除锄苗外，半月内剩余四百四十五工，即腾出全劳力廿九人，搞副业生产。侯家庄刨药技师王福海、温三儿，组织了八个人到霍山刨药，王根慕等八人组织了一个割麦小组，到霍县、赵城割麦。两组共余十三个剩余劳力，组织了一个机动小组，主要是准备参战时出差，不参战时在本村附近搞副业生产或做一些零星活。半月内刨药小组因下雨和走路，只劳动三天赚了七万元，合小米十石。割麦小组共收入三万零四百元，合小米四石五斗。第四、细密组织做到生产参战两不耽误，阴历四月二十三日，该村民夫八人要去参战，但秋苗马上就得锄，因此他们非常着急，互助大队即向他们提出保证，八家二十八亩苗在大家协力下，现已全锄过，因此感激得出发参战的王明忱、王宣则二人自动要求参加互助组。又有王五孩、王根年二人因害病不能上地，虽然他们不是互助组人，但互助大队同样给他们把苗锄过，所以王根年病刚一好，便也自动参加了互助组。现在互助大队是越发展越大，越大越巩固了。
