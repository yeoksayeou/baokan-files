　　[This dispatch from our YuWanSu bureau on the 3rd] (Delayed report) When the main force of the YuWanSu People's Liberation Army was confronted with an invasion by Chiang’s 58th Division, combined with local bandits, totaling over 10,000 men, against our Haozhou and Luyi areas, we proactively shifted to external operations. On the 24th, we traveled a hundred li to launch a surprise attack and capture the city of Fuyang, annihilating over 200 men from the Chiang's Anhui Province Fifth Special Commissioner's Office Training Corps. We seized 11 light machine guns, over 150 rifles, 6 vehicles, and over 20,000 sets of military uniforms.

　　[This dispatch from our JiLuYu bureau on the 2nd] A certain unit of our Sixth Military Sub-district's local corps repelled grain-grabbing enemies and annihilated two of their companies. At 11:00 AM on the 15th, a battalion of the enemy's 96th Army, 1st Regiment, along with a machine gun and artillery company, carrying two heavy machine guns, over ten light machine guns, and one mortar, arrived in the Shuangmiaotun area of the Second District of Qi-Yu to seize grain. After our local corps received the news, they detoured to cut off the enemy's retreat. With lightning speed, we engaged the enemy, and after a fierce battle of half an hour, we annihilated most of them. We killed and wounded over 20 enemy officers and soldiers, including Company Commander Du. We captured enemy officers and soldiers including Captain Medical Officer Pan Dayou, Lieutenant Platoon Leader An Deshan, and 73 others. The remaining remnants fled in disarray into Qihe City. In this battle, we annihilated two enemy companies, seizing two Maxim heavy machine guns, six American-Canadian light machine guns, two American-made portable machine guns, ninety-three rifles and carbines, two Mauser pistols, over 10,000 rounds of American-made ammunition, ten boxes of mortar shells, and over 380,000 Chiang's currency.

　　[This dispatch from our JiLuYu bureau on the 2nd] The fourth, sixth, and seventh districts of Feicheng have established a joint defense, repeatedly defeating Chiang's troops who attempted to seize grain and conscript soldiers. Since the enemy established a stronghold in Shiqiao on June 2nd, the masses quickly organized a joint defense. On the 4th, the joint defense team repelled enemies who came to Yintun to seize grain and conscript soldiers, killing or wounding two of the enemy, causing them to gain nothing. On the 18th, the enemy went to Hengyu and Xinglongzhuang to seize grain. On their return, they were attacked by the joint defense militia, wounding over ten enemies, and the four carts of grain they had seized were recovered by the masses. (Attached picture)
