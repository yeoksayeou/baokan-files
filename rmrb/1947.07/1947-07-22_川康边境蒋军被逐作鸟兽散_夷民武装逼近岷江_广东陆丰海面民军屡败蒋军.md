Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: The Shanghai press reports that in early June, the Chiang government bloodily washed the area of Leibo County, southwestern Sichuan, in the Greater and Lesser Liang Mountains, slaughtering 8,000 Yi compatriots. Those massacred belonged to the Bu Zhi branch of the Yi people, and died tragically under the intense machine gun fire of the Chiang troops. Now the Yi people of Sichuan and Kang have risen up in resistance. The Chiang troops in the area of Lifan and Maogong Counties in northwestern Sichuan and within tens of miles of Danba County on the west bank of the Dajin River in Kang territory have been driven away by the Yi compatriots, and the Yi people's armed forces have approached the Min River.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: According to the Tianjin Minguo Daily on the 1st of this month, a people's rebellion armed force has recently appeared on the sea off Lufeng County, Guangdong Province, repeatedly defeating Chiang's troops. On May 21, this unit of the people's army landed and attacked the Zheng Yanmin unit of the Chiang Kai-shek's security brigade in Jiazi Town, capturing all its weapons and ammunition. On May 29, they also drove away the Chiang Kai-shek's military police in Fushi City, and once occupied the city, seizing all the funds and materials in the Chiang Kai-shek's land and grain office warehouse. The people's army totals more than 200 people, led by Wu Bin, and possesses two fishing boats and two sailboats, two heavy machine guns, twelve light machine guns, two grenade launchers, and a large number of rifles. They frequently patrol the sea off Hudong, Jiazi, Jinxiang, and Wukan in Lufeng territory. (The newspaper stated: This unit is designated as the "East Guangdong Branch of the July 16th China Democratic League.")

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: According to a TASS dispatch from Shanghai on the 17th quoting the Dagong Bao: Two companies of the Kuomintang security regiment stationed in Suzhou and Xihua (transliteration) have defected.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, poor people in Suixi, northern Shaanxi, are launching movements everywhere to seize grain and eat from the big households. In mid-June, poor people in Linggui, Liancheng, Songcui, Huawu and other townships in Fugu County, northern Shaanxi, launched a movement to demand grain and beg for food from wealthy households. It has developed rapidly over the past month and has formed a fixed organization, traveling and eating in various places along several routes. Wherever they go, poor people join in. As of now, they have passed through more than ten townships, and the number of participants has reached more than 3,000. In May and June, poor people in various parts of Suixi rose up to seize grain. Among them, Sarachi, a county located on the north bank of the Yellow River and on the PingSui Railway, which is known as a relatively wealthy county, also experienced waves of poor people seizing grain on June 4th and 6th.
