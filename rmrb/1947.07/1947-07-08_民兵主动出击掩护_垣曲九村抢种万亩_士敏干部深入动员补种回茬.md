　　Militia Actively Attack to Provide Cover
  　Yuanqu Nine Villages Rush to Plant Ten Thousand Mu
  　Township and Village Cadres Conduct In-depth Mobilization to Replant Damaged Crops
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 6th dispatch] In Yuanqu Third District, after continuous heavy rain on the 9th and 10th of last month, district cadres and militia intensified their activities to lead and protect the masses in rushing to plant. From the 12th to the 20th, more than ten thousand mu have been safely planted in the original top-grade nine villages. Comrade Hou Jianyu, a district cadre, helped the masses carry 100 loads of manure and roll two mu of land, and Comrade Shen Shulian helped carry 50 loads of manure and plant two mu of land. During the rush planting, 80% of the male and female able-bodied laborers in each village were organized, with men carrying manure, old men plowing the land, and women and children sowing seeds. Grain was hidden at night, and Chen Liu, the militia captain, led the militia to actively attack from time to time, compressing the enemy into strongholds, protecting the masses' safe planting. The masses all said, "No matter what, we have already planted. As long as one seed goes into the ground, it will be worth ten thousand seeds entering the granary." After planting, the masses in each village sent their cattle to the base area, saying, "The land is planted, and the things are hidden. Even if the stubborn enemy comes, they will have nothing to grab."
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 6th dispatch] From last winter to the summer harvest, Shimin had never had a thorough rain. Recently, there was hail again. The leadership saw that the disaster was already forming, so they mobilized all cadres to go deep into the countryside, share weal and woe with the masses, and overcome this disaster. Cui Jixiang, chairman of the Fifth District Farmers' Association, led all cadres to the countryside. The first ideological obstacle encountered was the masses waiting for rain; for example, Zhang Qingji, an old man from Changzheng Village, said as soon as he saw the cadres: "Don't worry, don't be afraid of the first three, just be afraid of the last four. Summer solstice high mountains don't plant wheat, and He Xia still has to plant reed millet." Chairman Cui knew that it was not easy to get through the old people's thinking, so he had to take his time, so he spent a day calculating accounts for the old man; from the season to the number of days, from the harvest to the poor harvest, from the population of his family to his grain, and finally from the mistake of waiting for rain to the urgent need to rush to plant and replant. The old man suddenly realized that naturally his thinking was more backward than that of young people, so he followed what Chairman Cui said and preached everywhere in the village, mobilizing everyone to prevent disasters, rush to plant, and rush to replant. The next day, Zhang Suying from Kongbi Hanzhuang came to race with the old man Zhang to save replanting and sowing, setting off a campaign of rushing to plant and replant in the whole village. Cadres from nearby villages heard that Chairman Cui's leadership in Changzheng and Langbi villages had a way to fight drought and prepare for disasters, and came to learn from them. The Third District suffered the most severe hail disaster. On the 23rd of last month, hail the size of eggs fell for 20 minutes, and crops in ten of the thirteen administrative villages in the district were damaged, and the masses' morale was severely hit. District cadres immediately went to the countryside that night to deploy rushing to plant and replant, but the more the masses saw the disaster, the more helpless they were, and they all waited to see what others would do. Several district cadres gathered in Dingjia Village and first replanted their own land. The masses saw that there was really a way, and gradually started to do it, plus the leadership of the cadres, now 4,000 mu of corn have been replanted in the district, all showing seedlings, especially in Dingjia Village, because of the centralized leadership of district cadres, 432 mu were replanted and 180 mu were replanted in one and a half days.

　　民兵主动出击掩护
  　垣曲九村抢种万亩
  　士敏干部深入动员补种回茬
    【本报太岳六日电】垣曲三区于上月九、十两日连落透雨，区干部民兵即加紧活动，领导与掩护群众抢种。自十二日到廿日，原上等九村已安全抢种一万余亩。区干侯鉴玉同志帮助群众担粪一百担，砘地二亩，申树连同志帮助担粪五十担，种地二亩。各村在抢种中，百分之八十的男女全半劳力都组织起来，男人担粪，老汉犁地，妇女小孩点籽。黑夜藏粮，民兵队长陈六同志带领民兵不时主动出击，把敌人压缩到据点内，保护了群众安全抢种。群众都说：“不管怎样，咱已种上啦，只要一粒籽下地，就要叫万粒入仓”。各村群众在抢种后就把耕牛送到根据地，说：“地种上，东西藏好，顽固来了也没得抢”。
    【本报太岳六日电】士敏自去冬至夏收从未下过透雨，最近又落冰雹，领导上眼见灾象已成，便动员全体干部分头深入乡村，与群众同共患难，克服这一灾害。五区农会主席崔继祥带领全部干部下乡，首先遇到的思想障碍是群众的等雨；如长征村张青季老汉一见干部便说：“不要愁，不怕前三，单怕后四，夏至高山不种麦，河下还要种卢谷”。崔主席知道打通老年人的思想不容易，必须要慢慢来，便化了一天时间给老汉算了算帐；从季节算到天数，从丰收算到歉收，从他家的人口算到他的粮食，最后才从坐等下雨的错误谈到急须抢种抢补。老汉恍然大悟，自然思想比年青人落后，于是就照着崔主席的话在村中到处宣传，动员大家防灾抢种抢补。第二天，孔壁韩庄张素英便来和张老汉绕赛节约回茬点种，掀起了全村的抢种抢补运动，附近村子干部听见崔主席领导长征、郎壁村抗旱备灾有办法，纷纷前来学习。三区遭雹灾最严重，上月二十三日鸡蛋大的冰雹下了二十分钟，全区十三个行政村即有十个村的庄稼被打坏，群众情绪蒙受严重打击。区干部当夜即分头下乡布置抢种抢补，但群众越见灾大越没办法，都等看别人怎么办。几个区干部便在丁家庄集中起来，先补种回茬自己的地，群众看见果真有办法，也逐渐的干起来，再加干部的领导，现全区已回茬玉茭四千亩，皆露苗，尤以丁家庄为最快，因有区干部的集中领导，一天半的时间便回茬四百三十二亩，补种一百八十亩。
