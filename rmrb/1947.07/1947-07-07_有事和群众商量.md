　　Discuss Matters with the Masses
    Chen Boda
  　(I) Comrade Mao Zedong’s Main Method of Thought.
    “It must be understood that the masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ridiculous. Failure to understand this point makes it impossible to acquire even the most rudimentary knowledge. It is my wish to learn together with all comrades in the Party and continue to be a pupil.” The above words were written by Comrade Mao Zedong in the “Preface to Rural Surveys.” “I am still a pupil, a pupil of the masses… The opinions and experiences of the masses must be the foundation of our policies. Because the people can give us many, many things. Our task is to listen to them, learn from and understand them, and then return them as policies.” The above words were spoken by Comrade Mao Zedong to a foreign journalist. Look! The most outstanding and greatest people’s leader in China’s history, the mentor of the Chinese people’s liberation cause, sees himself as nothing more than a pupil of the masses. But we must know that this is why Comrade Mao Zedong is so great. The reason why Comrade Mao Zedong is able to most correctly guide the Chinese people's cause forward, and guide the Chinese Communist Party forward, is because he can willingly be a pupil of the masses; can concentrate the opinions of the masses and turn them into guiding wisdom. Many people want to learn Comrade Mao Zedong’s method of thought, but often see it as mysterious, as a “heavenly book” that cannot be understood by ordinary people. Forgetting or being unwilling to learn Comrade Mao Zedong’s main method of thought of learning from the masses becomes the root cause of many comrades making mistakes. In fact, Comrade Mao Zedong’s main method of thought is something everyone can learn. But as Comrade Mao Zedong said: if there is “no full of enthusiasm, no determination to look downwards, no thirst for knowledge, no putting down airs and the spirit of willingly being a pupil, one will certainly not be able to do it, and certainly not do it well.” "To be a student of the masses, one must be respectful, diligent, and adopt a comradely attitude; otherwise, they will ignore me, knowing but not speaking, speaking but not fully." Learning Comrade Mao Zedong’s main method of thought, for any Communist Party member who encounters difficulties, is not a question of whether the individual has the ability, but a question of whether they are willing to make a determination. This is changing one's mind; this is a revolution of thought.
    (II) Two Different Working Lines
    In doing anything, there are ultimately two different lines: one is the bureaucratic line, which is commandism and special talents-ism. It only coerces the masses, only simply asks the masses for things, only makes "plans" behind closed doors, makes "communiques," and rigidly applies them to the masses in a stereotyped manner. The other is the mass line, which is to learn from the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses, use more than 90 percent of our strength to give things to the masses, and then use 10 percent or a few percent of our strength to ask the masses for things. As for the things to be asked for, it is for use in the cause of the masses. And regardless of the occasion, it is never starting from a "formula" beyond space and time, but from the specific situation of the masses at the local time. The former line is the anti-Chairman Mao line, and the latter line is the Chairman Mao line. Doing things according to the former line will inevitably spoil things and inevitably cause dissatisfaction among the masses. And all those who do things well, who can receive full support from the masses, always do things according to the latter line. Comrades who work according to the bureaucratic line, or feel that they can "complete the task" by doing so, and can also "do it quickly," saving "trouble," actually, these comrades completely do not understand that our task is nothing else, any of our tasks is only one: to serve the people, for the interests of the people. All tasks must first be discussed with the people, clarified in front of the masses, fully discussed among the masses, agreed to by the masses, and then started by the masses themselves. This is the mass line, and it is also being responsible to the people. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said well in the report on amending the Party Constitution: "Our party members are ordered by the party's leading organs and leaders to carry out work, and they must be responsible to the party's leading organs and leaders in their work. But if this responsibility to the leading organs is viewed separately from responsibility to the people, that is wrong. We must be responsible to the people in order to fulfill the final and greatest responsibility… Every party member is responsible to the people is responsible to the party, and being irresponsible to the people is the most irresponsible to the party. It is necessary to understand the unity of being responsible to the party and being responsible to the people, and to unify the two. Do not separate or oppose the two. If you find that the tasks, policies, and working styles instructed by your leading organs and leaders have shortcomings or errors, you should suggest corrections to the leading organs and leaders in the spirit of being responsible to the people, and you must clarify the right and wrong, do not be perfunctory, otherwise you will not be responsible to the people, which is also not responsible to the party." Considering and carrying out everything through the mass line is to be responsible to the people. And the attitude of the bureaucratic line is precisely not an attitude of being responsible to the people. Hovering in their minds, whether towards superiors or subordinates, are the simple two words of "command"; seen in their actions towards superiors or subordinates are also the simple two words of "command." They sever the connection between being responsible to the people and being responsible to higher-level organs; they neither consider the connection between "tasks" and the interests of the people, and often use simple methods, decided by a few cadres, to "arrange" tasks that were originally correctly proposed, forcing the masses to carry them out, not consulting with the masses, not allowing the masses to freely express their opinions and decide on problems, or find ways to solve problems, and even for the opinions or problems raised by the masses, they have already arranged "replies" among the cadres in advance. They completely do not wait for the masses' thinking to mature and actions to mature, they do what they want to do themselves. As a result, even if the task is correctly proposed, and the task seems to be "completed," it will still cause suspicion and dissatisfaction among the masses. And even if it is giving things to the masses, but that has not been carefully discussed with the masses, has not passed through the masses' own thoughts and strength, first, it will not be given well, will not be given properly. Second, the masses will have a passive and suspicious attitude towards what is given and received, or will be unwilling to accept it. Third, as a result, what is given is not solid, and may even be lost. Therefore, the attempt to avoid "trouble" will result in creating even greater and more trouble. Making contributions for the people is a good thing; this is what we Communist Party members should do. But it must be pointed out: some comrades, regardless of the occasion, for any matter, are doing it for their own sake of showing off merit. They start from their own "showing off merit" and "competing for merit." What they pursue are simple numbers (Heaven knows! Those numbers can still be fabricated according to their own ideas), they are satisfied with being able to fill out forms. They only hope that higher-level organs will reward their "achievements," without thinking that all achievements must be approved by the masses. Comrades who have this kind of thinking do things by using the bureaucratic line method instead of the mass line method. And in fact, the "merit" they have made is very suspicious. Discussing matters with the masses, this is the main spirit of Chairman Mao's mass line. Chairman Mao also said to a foreign journalist: "The decisive factor in our work is that we always discover which policies are acceptable to the people, and which policies the people have opinions or objections to. Only policies that have been proven to be supported by the masses can become the policies of our Party." Let everyone chew on Chairman Mao's words, "Only policies that have been proven to be supported by the masses can become the policies of our Party." But how can it be decided, and how can it be proven, what is a policy supported by the masses? Obviously, if it does not come from the masses, it cannot be decided and there is no way to prove it. That is to say, it is necessary to discuss with the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses, and learn from them. When deciding on our Party's policies, when implementing our Party's policies, and when checking whether our Party's policies are correct, we cannot be separated from the opinions of the masses, and we must take the opinions of the masses as the criterion. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "This is the most basic key. If the leaders of a political party are truly working for the interests of the people, if they are loyal in this struggle, they have unlimited opportunities to listen to the opinions of the people." (The above quotations from Chairman Mao to foreign journalists can be found in the "Impressions of Mao Zedong" compiled and printed by Xinhua Bookstore) Listen everyone, repeating Comrade Mao Zedong's words, that is: those who can listen to the opinions of the people without limit are truly working for the interests of the people, and they are loyal in the struggle for the cause of the people. Then, any good Communist Party member, any student of Chairman Mao, must be able to withstand the test here.
    (III) The Masses Have Unlimited Ideological Creativity
    Obviously, there are also some Party members within the Communist Party who look down on the opinions of the masses; they think that the masses are "ignorant," and they are always "extremely clever." Therefore, they are unwilling to discuss matters with the masses, and act arbitrarily. It must be awakened that these Communist Party members, whether consciously or unconsciously, are putting their views into the views of the Kuomintang; this view is incompatible with Mao Zedong's thought and the Communist Party's thought. "The public are saints," this is an old folk saying; the wisdom of the masses is unlimited, only the masses have the greatest creativity, only concentrating the wisdom of the masses is the greatest wisdom. In fact, any difficult problem, something that one cannot figure out in one's mind, can be easily solved and suddenly understood once discussed with the masses; this is well known to many comrades who have experience in the revolution, especially Chairman Mao often uses this experience to tell comrades. Unfortunately, some of our comrades often turn a blind eye to the creativity of the masses. They think that it is just a "small" word or a thing, and there is no need to be surprised. Even on the issue of land reform, there is creativity of the masses everywhere. For example, according to the reflection of a comrade: in 1943, when the rent reduction was being carried out, a landlord in Ge Duo Village, Jingle, wanted to evade rent reduction, using tricks and means to sell land to several rich peasants and upper-middle peasants. It was agreed, and the price was set, and they were about to sign the contract, but many poor peasants used the tenant protection rights of the democratic government's decree, and did not let him sell it. In 1944, when the liquidation was being carried out, the landlord returned two hundred mu of land and three courtyards. Originally, these two hundred mu were contracted by three wealthy middle peasants, who first planted the good land and flat land themselves, and then rented the remaining bad land to twenty-five middle and poor peasant households, and the land rent was the same for good and bad land. Because there was exploitation in this, the villagers called those three families "second landlords." At this time, the landlord withdrew, and those three families attempted to monopolize the good land, saying to the masses: "Whoever planted the land before will now return it to whoever." The masses said: "We have rented land for three generations, and everyone has planted flat land, sloping land, good land, and bad land. What can you give us? You are now all planting good land. If you want to divide all the good land and leave the bad land to us, we don't want it!" Those three families said: "It's impossible to sort out if we bring up the past." But the masses insisted on settling accounts and refunding rent with those three families. Those three families did not want to refund rent, and did not want to give good land to the masses, and the village was in chaos, unable to sort it out. A cadre at the time was not sure, and one day he met three old men, and they put forward an opinion: "Set aside the people in the village who have land, and divide it from the landless people little by little." (⑵⑶) This opinion enlightened the cadres' thinking. A mass meeting was held, and the masses refuted those three families. When dividing the land, the cadre said: "How to divide it?" The masses said: "Divide it from the root. Divide the land to those with less land first, and divide the land to those with more land later; divide more to those with more people, and divide less to those with fewer people." As a result, a "Land Distribution Representative Committee" was organized, and according to the principle of the masses, the land was distributed from the poorest in the village according to the population. In the era of rent reduction and liquidation, this can be said to be a great creation of the masses. This creation, first, prevented the landlord from converting the land into silver dollars to evade land reform. Second, it shows that landlords have been exploiting for generations, and everyone has planted good land and bad land, changing the unfair distribution method of "whoever plants it owns it" in many areas at that time. Third, it implements a fair and reasonable average land distribution method according to the population. Of course, the material we have access to is not very complete, and at that time, this creation was undoubtedly still preliminary, incomplete, and crude. But this example fully illustrates the creativity of the masses. According to the recollection of a cadre: "For seven or eight days, we cadres were worried and could not solve the problem. After going through the masses and listening to the masses, everything was solved overnight." For another example, in the recent land distribution in Haojia Slope, Lin County, the masses have already created something new, that is, re-evaluating the output of the land and setting a standard output, and distributing it evenly according to the population and the degree of poverty. For example, each person is allocated land with an output of one stone and five dou, and the poverty degree of landless and land-scarce peasants is further divided into three grades, and three output standards are set, and the land is distributed equally according to the grades. The result of implementing this method is that landless poor peasants and destitute peasants are the first grade, and each person (veterans and bachelors from other places are counted as two people) is allocated land with an output of two stones; poor peasants who lack a lot of land are the second grade, and each person is allocated land with an output of one stone and seven dou; and secondary poor peasants who do not lack much land but need to be supplemented with land are the third grade, and each person is allocated land with an output of one stone and five dou. According to the opinion of the masses, this method is the most fair (according to output) and the most reasonable (divided into grades). Because the average distribution according to one output standard still makes landless and destitute peasants suffer, the content of this creation is to solve the principle of distribution according to the degree of poverty.
    In addition, according to the reports of land reform work teams in various places, the creations of the masses in the land reform movement are simply numerous. The creations of the masses are always lively and vigorous, they have no rigid formulas, no rigid tables, they are pondering according to the specific situation, and the specific situation of each county and even each village often has its own characteristics, or there are differences; therefore, the things created have an extremely rich and complex diversity. This kind of self-creation of the masses based on the specific situation of their own villages, meets the requirements of the masses, so it is supported by the masses, and has the greatest vitality. As long as we can sincerely and humbly discuss with the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses, and be good at enlightening them, then the creativity of the masses will continue to emerge endlessly. On the contrary, if our attitude is arrogant and arbitrary, and we do not listen to the opinions of the masses, but ignore them; we do not enlighten them, but suppress them; then we will definitely damage the ideological creativity of the masses. It can be said without exception that in every place where work teams go, wherever the work is more creative and done the best or relatively well, it is certainly because they have discussed with the masses the most; wherever the work lacks creativity and is done poorly or the worst, it is certainly because they have discussed with the masses less, or have not discussed with the masses. Most things are done well, but if one or two things are not done well, it is probably always because these one or two things have not been discussed with the masses first. If we do not discuss with the masses, we cannot know the needs of the masses, we cannot have in-depth investigation and research, we cannot determine the work steps and struggle policies that the local and current masses can indeed (that is, indeed, not superficially, formally) support, we cannot improve the awareness of the masses according to the specific situation of the local and current situation (from the awareness of individual interests, to the awareness of the interests of the general masses; from economic awareness, to political awareness); we cannot make the thinking and actions of the masses mature, and naturally move towards revolution; we cannot let the masses decide for themselves and start themselves, and handle their own problems according to the voluntary principle proposed by Chairman Mao; we cannot solve the problem in a way that truly satisfies the masses; therefore, we will certainly not be able to have any real creation in our work.
    (IV) One of the Characteristics of the Masses' Method of Thought
    Here, I am not going to talk about all the characteristics of the masses' method of thought, but only one of the greatest characteristics of the masses' method of thought. The reason why the masses (that is, the real masses) handle problems so easily and properly, easily fairly and reasonably, is that they are very good at repeatedly comparing all kinds of things in various ways. For example, the views of the masses in Ge Duo Village, Jingle, on land distribution, which I quoted earlier, were made by making various comparisons; not only comparing the present, but also comparing the past; (such as saying "This land has been rented for three generations, and everyone has planted flat land, sloping land, good land, and bad land.") They also compare those with less land with those with more land, and compare those with more people with those with fewer people. The masses in Haojia Slope divide the poverty of the peasants into three grades, which is also a comparison. It is from repeated comparisons that they draw conclusions. When the masses examine problems, they find differences and discover contradictions through repeated comparisons, and then find ways to solve the problems. They compare the specific and real things of the local and current situation, and formulate general methods for handling problems. And when dealing with problems, everyone compares more specifically one by one. For example, in places where the mass line is truly implemented to distribute land, the masses have carried out this kind of repeated comparison and repeated deliberation for each specific family and each specific piece of land. According to population needs and poverty, they compare back and forth, pulling up and down. Therefore, they can handle it properly, get fairness, and get reasonableness. It can be said completely that without this kind of comparison and deliberation by the masses, relying solely on the work team and a few people to handle it would certainly not have fairness and reasonableness. This fairness and reasonableness is entirely the result of the masses' comparison back and forth.
    The same is true for the cadre problem that occurs in various places. The cadre problem is basically a problem within the peasant class, a problem of the relationship between cadres and the masses within the peasants. Which cadre is good, which cadre is bad; which cadre has made mistakes but can be educated; which point is meritorious, which point is flawed; which point is an advantage, which point is a disadvantage; there is usually a comparison in the minds of the masses. Handing over the cadre problem to the masses for criticism, education, and handling, and letting the masses make another serious and prudent comparison in a collective setting, then it is certainly impossible for personal protection and favoritism to occur, and it will certainly not have burying talent. In other words, it will definitely be able to handle it properly, fairly, and reasonably. In this way, the cadres gain real transformation through the great power of mass education; and the masses also educate and transform themselves. In this way, it will definitely be able to clarify the mutual relationship between cadres and the masses, and achieve the true unity of cadres and the masses. Of course, the masses are not monolithic, the masses contain various different strata, and even different classes. Not only that, in the masses, the level of awareness is often different, there are advanced, intermediate, and backward, so there will be various different opinions. But in the mass setting, they will also compare various different opinions; and comparing back and forth, they will affirm an opinion that is commonly recognized by everyone or recognized by the majority. After the masses repeatedly discuss (argue) and repeatedly compare various different opinions, the opinion finally affirmed by everyone or the majority is often the most appropriate or relatively appropriate, and the error is the least or less. Correct opinions will only stand out in the repeated discussion (argument) and repeated comparison of the masses. And the affirmation of correct opinions is often further enriched in the discussion and comparison, and absorbs those parts of various opinions that may be more appropriate, and concentrates them into complete or relatively complete correct opinions. And those incorrect opinions will be eliminated in this process of debate and concentration. This opinion, which is concentrated after the discussion and comparison of the masses, is the measure of the development of the level of awareness of the masses at the local time, and we must act according to this measure. Leaving this measure, if it is "not enough," it is right opportunism; if it is "too much," it is "left" opportunism, or called adventurism, open-doorism. On the one hand, we cannot pander to backward elements and ignore the legitimate interests of the masses (such as the interests of employed poor peasants); but on the other hand, the opinions of the advanced class or advanced elements need to obtain the consent and support of the majority of the masses (such as employed poor peasants taking the initiative to win the consent of middle peasants), otherwise they will fall into isolation. Discussing with the masses is carried out in various occasions. Individual talks, collective talks, small forums, large forums, talks with different strata or different classes, etc. As long as we are attentive, we can inspire our own thinking in any occasion. For example, in Ge Duo Village, Jingle, the method of distributing land was an idea inspired by a cadre from the words of three old men, and then it was developed in a mass meeting and clearly affirmed by the masses. Of course, it is also wrong to adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards the opinions of the masses; leaders also need to transform the method of comparison and deliberation of the masses into their own method of leadership. That is to compare and deliberate various different opinions, see their different class content, see their rationality or irrationality, and select, integrate, affirm and negate, unite or struggle, and determine the problem, determine the policy. Through the masses themselves, to gradually improve the awareness of the masses. This is what Chairman Mao said: "Concentrate and persist." The method of repeated comparison and deliberation is the truly scientific method of analysis of the masses. This method undoubtedly needs to be learned by all our workers. With such a method of analysis, we can avoid personal impulsiveness and arbitrariness; and in any occasion, we can easily avoid mistakes.
    (V) Let Go and Take the Road of the Masses
    There is a passage in the book of Mencius: "If everyone around you says he is virtuous, that is not enough. If all the officials say he is virtuous, that is not enough. If the people of the country all say he is virtuous, then examine him; if you see virtue in him, then use him. If everyone around you says he is not good, do not listen. If all the officials say he is not good, do not listen. If the people of the country all say he is not good, then examine him; if you see that he is not good, then remove him…." This passage is very good. According to our situation, it is like this: it is not enough to base it on what the cadres say, it is not enough to base it on what the activists say, but it is enough to base it on what the masses say. It is not enough to only discuss things with the cadres, it is still not enough to only discuss things with the activists, but it is necessary to further discuss things with the masses. This is an extremely important and serious problem for our cadres. Many tasks have not been done well in the past because Chairman Mao's attitude and method were not seriously implemented. The policies of our Party originally came from the masses; but if our lower-level cadres do not implement the mass line of policies, it is useless to have good policies. Our cadres must resolutely and thoroughly abandon the old set of bureaucracy. Summarizing what has been said above, it can be summarized in the following points: (1) Everyone should be determined to truly learn from Chairman Mao, be a pupil of the masses, and discuss matters with the masses. (2) Trust the correctness of the masses, and problems cannot be solved without the decision of the masses, so let go and hand over the problem to the masses for discussion and handling. All our mistakes should be publicly admitted in front of the masses; decide to let the masses overturn whatever the masses consider inappropriate, and let the masses decide again. We must transform our various cadres and organizations according to the opinions of the masses. (3) Do not rigidly apply formulas, but start from the specific situation of the local and current masses. "According to the level of awareness of the masses, inspire and improve the awareness of the masses. Under the principle of the masses' own voluntary will, help the masses to gradually organize and gradually launch all the necessary struggles permitted by the internal and external environment at the local time." (See "On Coalition Government") (4) We do not advocate tailism or laissez-faireism. But we must be good at concentrating the opinions of the masses and transforming them into a compass to guide the masses' movement forward. Transform the methods of examining and solving problems of the masses into our methods of guiding the masses. (5) In this way, we can achieve the unity of the leadership direction, the leading cadres, and the masses, and be able to make "every step and every action" of our great party that serves the people "naturally move towards revolutionizing the masses"; and consolidate all the fruits gained by the masses from the struggle. Recently, a work team came back from the countryside and brought back a few words said by a farmer there: "Politics must be placed among the people; in the past, doing things was pouring from above, but now doing things is to scoop from below." These few words are very well said. We now want to discuss things with the masses, that is, to "scoop from below." This is all that has been said above.

### 有事和群众商量

专栏：

　　有事和群众商量
    陈伯达
  　（一）毛泽东同志的主要思想方法。
    “必须明白：群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己是往往幼稚可笑的。不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。和全党同志们共同学习，继续当一个小学生，这就是我的志愿。”上面这些话，是毛泽东同志在“农村调查序言”里所写的。“我还是一个小学生，群众的小学生……。群众的意见与经验，一定要为我们政策的基础。因为人民能给我们许许多多事情。我们的任务就是听从他们，学习与了解他们，再作为政策交还给他们”。上面这些话是毛泽东同志对一个外国记者所谈的。大家看！一个中国有历史以来的最杰出、最伟大的人民领袖，中国人民解放事业的导师，他对于自己的看法不过是群众的小学生。但是我们必须知道，这就是毛泽东同志的所以伟大。毛泽东同志的所以能够最正确地指导中国人民事业前进，指导中国共产党前进，就是因为他能够甘当群众的小学生；能够集中群众的意见，变成指导的智慧。许多人都想学习毛泽东同志的思想方法，但是往往把他看成奥妙的，似乎不能为常人所理解的“天书”。忘记了或者不愿意学习毛泽东同志这种向群众学习的主要思想方法，而就成为许多同志犯错误的根源。事实上，毛泽东同志这种主要思想方法，是人人都可以学到的。但是正如毛泽东同志所说：如果“没有满腔的热忱，没有眼睛向下的决心，没有求知的渴望，没有放下臭架子与甘当小学生的精神，是一定不能做也一定做不好的”。“给群众当学生是必须恭谨勤劳，与采取同志态度的；否则他们就不理我，知而不言，言而不尽。”学习毛泽东同志这个主要思想方法，对于任何一个共产党员所遇到的困难，不是个人有没有能力的问题，而是肯不肯下决心的问题。这是换脑筋，这是思想的革命。
    （二）两条不同的工作路线
    做任何事情，归根到底有两条不同的路线：一条是官僚主义的路线，就是命令特长主义。只是向群众强迫，只是简单地向群众要东西，只是闭门造“计划”，造“公报”，千篇一律硬套在群众上面。又一条是群众路线，乃是向群众学习，听取群众意见，用百分之九十以上的力量给群众东西，随后才用百分之十或百分之几的力量向群众要东西。至于所要的东西，就是为的用在群众的事业上面。而不管在任何场合，决不是从超空间，超时间的“公式”出发，而是从当地当时群众的具体情况出发。前一条的路线是反毛主席的路线，后一条路线，就是毛主席的路线。按照前一条路线做事情，就必然把事情办坏，就必然引起群众不满。而凡是把事情做得好，能受群众充分拥护的，总是按照后一条路线去做的。按照官僚主义路线办事的同志，或者觉得他们那样做也能够“完成任务”，而且还可以“做得快”，省得“麻烦”，实际上这类同志完全不了解我们的任务没有别的，我们的任何任务都只是一个：为人民服务，为人民的利益。一切任务都必须首先和人民群众商量，在群众面前弄清楚，在群众中充分讨论，为群众所同意，并由群众自己动手起来。这是群众路线，又正是对人民负责。刘少奇同志在修改党章报告上说得好：“我们党员受了党的领导机关与领导人的命令，去进行工作，他们在工作中是要对党的领导机关与领导人负责的。但如果把这种对领导机关负责与对人民负责分开来看，那是错误的。必须对人民负责，才算是尽了最后与最大之责…………。每个党员，对人民负责即是对党负责，对人民不负责即对党最不负责。要理解对党负责与对人民负责的一致性，要使二者统一起来。不要使二者割裂开来，对立起来。如果发现自己领导机关与领导人所指示的任务、政策和工作作风有缺点、错误时，即应以对人民负责的精神，向领导机关与领导人建议改正，要弄清是非，不要马虎敷衍，否则就是对人民没有负起责任，也就是对党没有负起责任。”一切事情经过群众路线来考虑，来进行，就是对人民负起责任。而官僚主义路线的态度，恰不是对人民负起责任的态度。盘旋在他们脑中的对上对下，都是“命令”的简单两个字；见之于他们行动的对上对下也都是“命令”的简单两个字。他们割裂对人民负责与对上级机关负责的联系；他们既不考虑“任务”与人民利益的联系，而且往往把原来正确提出的任务，用简单的方法，用几个干部决定，“布置”下来，强迫群众去执行，不和群众商量，不让群众自由发表意见与决定问题，或找出解决问题的道路，甚至对于群众提出意见或问题，预先即已在干部中布置了“答复”。他们完全不待群众的思想成熟与行动成熟，自己想干就干。结果即使任务的提出是正确的，任务也似乎“完成”了，但也会引起群众的怀疑与不满。并且即使是给群众东西，但那并没有和群众仔细商量，没有通过群众自己的思想和力量，第一，就不会给好，不会给得妥当。第二，群众对于所给和所得的东西，会抱着消极和怀疑的态度，或者不乐意接受。第三，结果所给的东西是不巩固的，还有可能丧失。所以那种企图避免“麻烦”，结果就会造成更大更多的麻烦来。为人民立功这是好事，这是我们共产党员要做的。但要指出：有些同志不管在任何场合，对任何事情，乃是为着自己标功。从自己“标功”、“争功”出发。他们追求的是简单的数字（天晓得！那种数字还是可以随自己的主意编造的），是以能够填出表格为满足。他们只希望上级机关奖励自己的“功劳”，而没有想到一切功劳是必须经过群众批准才算的。有这种想法的同志，他们办事便是以官僚主义路线的方法来代替群众路线的方法。而事实上，他们所立的“功”，就是很可疑的。有事和群众商量，这是毛主席群众路线主要的精神。毛主席对一个外国记者还说过：“在我们工作中决定的因素，是我们总是去发现哪些政策是人民大众接受的，而哪些政策老百姓是有意见或提出反对的。只有证明了为大众所拥护的政策，才能成为我们党的政策”。大家咀嚼毛主席这句话吧，“只有证明了为大众所拥护的政策，才能成为我们党的政策”。但是，怎样能够决定，又怎样能够证明什么是大众所拥护的政策呢。显然的，如果不从群众中来，就不能决定也无从证明。就是说，必须要和群众商量，听取群众的意见，向他们学习。在决定我们党的政策的时候，在执行我们党的政策的时候，在检查我们党的政策是否正确的时候，都离不开群众的意见，都必须以群众的意见为准绳。毛泽东同志说：“这是最基本的关键。如果一个政党的领导人，是在真正地为人民大众的利益而工作着的，如果在这奋斗中他们是忠诚的，他们有无限的倾听人民意见的机会。（前引毛主席对外国记者的谈话均见新华书店编印的“毛泽东印象记”）大家听吧，把毛泽东同志的话反复地来说，那就是：能够无限地倾听人民意见的，那才是真正地为人民大众的利益而工作着的，那才是在为人民事业的奋斗中是忠诚的。那末，任何一个好的共产党员，任何一个毛主席的学生，就必在此受得起考验。
    （三）群众有无限的思想创造力
    显然的，在共产党内也有某些党员瞧不起群众的意见的；认为群众是“无知”，而自己总是“聪明绝顶”的。因此有事也就不愿和群众商量，一意孤行。必须警醒，这种共产党员，不管是自觉或不自觉，他们这样，是把自己的观点落到国民党的观点里面去了；这种观点是和毛主席的思想和共产党的思想不能相容的。“众人是圣人”，这是民间的一句老话；大众的智慧是无限的，只有群众才具有最大的创造力，只有集中大众的智慧才是最大的智慧。事实上，任何困难问题，自己在脑中想不通的东西，一和群众商量便能迎刃而解，豁然贯通；这是许多在革命上有经验的同志所熟知的，特别是毛主席经常用这种经验告诉了同志们。不幸的就是我们有些同志时常对于群众的创造熟视无睹。他们认为那不过是“小小的”一句话，或一件事，用不着去惊奇的。就在土地改革问题上，到处都有群众的创造。举例来说，根据一位同志的反映：一九四三年闹减租时，静乐圪垛村有一个地主想逃避减租，使用鬼计耍手段，要卖地给几个富农和富中农，说好了，价钱也定了，正要定契，可是许多贫苦农民，就利用了民主政府法令的保佃权，没有让他卖成。四四年闹清算时，那个地主退出了二百亩地，三座院子。原来这二百垧是由三家富裕中农包租下来，先自己把好地、坪地种上，再把剩下的坏地租给二十五户中贫农，地租摊款好地坏地一样。因为这里边有剥削，村里人就叫那三家为“二地主”。这时地主退出，那三家企图垄断好地，对群众说：“以前谁种的地现在退给谁。”群众们说：“还地租了三辈子，坪地、坡地、好地、赖地谁也种过，你们给我们哪一件子？你们现在全种的是好地，你们要把好地全分了，剩下赖地给我们，我们不要！”那三家说：“要提起以前来闹不清。”但群众就主张和那三家算帐退租。那三家又不想退租，又不愿给群众好地，村里吵成一片，闹不清。一位干部当时没有把握，有一天遇到三个老汉，他们就提出了意见：“把村里有地的人抛开，从没地的人一圪截一圪截的分。”（⑵⑶）这意见就启发了干部们的思想，开了群众会，群众把那三家驳倒了。分地时，干部说：“怎么分？”群众说：“从根子上分，地少的先分，地多的后分；人多的多分，人少的少分。”结果组织了“土地分配代表委员会”，按照群众的原则，从村里最穷的起，按人口把土地分配了。在减租清算时代，这可说是群众一种很大的创造。这个创造，第一、阻止了地主把土地转化为白洋，躲避土地改革的企图。第二、说明地主几辈子的剥削，好地坏地谁都种过，改变了当时许多地区“谁种归谁”的不公平分配的方法。第三、按人口实行公平合理的平均的土地分配方法。当然，我们接触的这个材料还不很完全，而当时这种创造，无疑地也还是初步的，不完全的，粗糙的。但是这个例子就充分说明了群众的创造力。按照一位干部的回忆所说：“七、八天我们干部愁得闹不开的事情、经过群众，听了群众的话，一夜就什么也解决了。”再举例来说，最近临县郝家坡的土地分配，群众早有新的创造，即重新将土地评出产量，定出一种产量标准，按人口和贫苦程度平均分配。如每人分一石五斗产量地，而且是就无地少地农民的贫苦程度再分为三等，定出三种产量标准，按等级平均分配。实行这种办法的结果，是无地贫农和赤贫为第一等，每人（外地复员军人和单身汉以二人计）分两石产量的地；缺地很多的贫农为第二等，每人分一石七斗产量的地；缺地不多，但须补地的次贫农为第三等，每人分一石五斗产量的地。据群众意见这种办法最公平（按产量），最合理（分等级）。因为按一种产量标准平分，无地的和赤贫，此次贫农还是吃亏，这个创造的内容，就是解决了按贫苦程度分配的原则。
    此外根据各地土地改革的工作团的报告，各地群众在土地改革运动中的创造，简直是很多很多的。群众的创造总是生动活泼的，他们没有死板的公式，没有死板表格，他们是按照具体的情形加以揣摩，而各县以至各地乡村具体的情形，时常是有自己的特点，或者有差别的；因此创造的东西就有极丰富的、复杂的多样性。这种根据自己乡村具体情况的群众自我创造，适合了群众的要求，因此就为群众所拥护，就有最大的生命力。只要我们能够真诚地谦逊地和群众商量，听取群众的意见，并善于启发，那末群众的创造力就会不断地、无限地涌出来。相反地，如果我们的态度是傲慢和武断，对于群众的意见不是倾听，而是不理；不是启发，而是压制；那末就一定损害群众的思想创造力。可以说毫无例外，各个工作团到各地方，凡是工作有多创造，而做得最好或较好的，一定是因为和群众商量得最多；凡是工作缺乏创造，而做得较差最差的，一定是因为和群众商量较少，或者是没有和群众商量。多数事情做得好，而有一件两件做不好的，大概也总是因为这一件两件没有先和群众商量。不和群众商量，就不能知道群众的需要，就不能有深入的调查研究，就不能确定为当地、当时群众所确实（是说确实的、不是说表面的、形式的）能够拥护的工作步骤与斗争方针，就不能够照当地、当时的具体情况提高群众的觉悟（由个别利害的觉悟，提高到一般群众利害的觉悟；由经济的觉悟，提高到政治的觉悟）；就不能使群众的思想和行动成熟起来，自然而然地走向革命化；就不能使群众自己决定，并自己动手起来，按照毛主席所提出的自愿的原则处理自己的问题；就不能把问题解决得让群众真正满意；因此在工作上也就一定不能够有什么真正的创造来。
    （四）群众思想方法的特点之一
    这里不准备谈群众思想方法一切的特点，这里只说群众思想方法一个最大的特点。群众（说是真正群众的）处理问题的所以容易妥当，容易公平与合理，就是很善于对各种事情不断反复地加以各种比较。比如前面引的静乐圪垛村群众对于土地分配的看法，便是做了各种比较；不只是比较现在，而且还比较过去；（如说“这地租了三辈子，坪地、坡地、好地、赖地，谁也种过。”）他们又比较地少与地多的，比较人多的与人少的。郝家坡群众把农民的贫苦程度分为三等，也就是一种比较、就是从反复的比较中得出结论。群众在考察问题时，经反复比较中找出差别，发现矛盾，因而又找出解决问题的方法。他们比较当地当时具体的、真实的东西，订出处理问题的一般办法。又在处理问题时，大家更具体的一件一件地比较。比如在真正实行群众路线去分配土地的地方，群众就是对于每个具体家庭、每块具体土地，实行了这种反复的比较，反复的揣摩。按照人口需要与贫苦程度，比来比去，拉上拉下。因此就能够处理得妥当，就得到了公平，得到了合理。完全可以说，如果没有这种群众的比较与揣摩，单凭工作团与少数人处理，就一定不能有公平，不能有合理。这种公平与合理，完全是由群众的比来比去而得的结果。
    在各地方发生的干部问题也是同样。干部问题基本上是农民阶级内部的问题，是农民内部的干部与群众之间关系的问题。哪一个干部是好的，哪一个干部是坏的；哪一个干部犯了错误但是可以教育的；哪点有功，哪点有过；哪点是优点，哪点是缺点；通常在群众心目中都是有一个比较的。把干部问题交给群众去批评、去教育、去处理、让群众们在集体的场合再加以一番认真的审慎的比较，那末就一定不可能发生个人的包庇、袒护，也一定不会有埋没。换句话说，就一定能够处理得妥当，能够公平，能够合理。这样使干部经过群众教育的大力量，获得了真正的改造；而且群众也教育了、改造了自己。这样就一定能够把干部与群众间的相互关系弄清楚，而达到了干部与群众的真正团结。当然，群众并不是清一色的，群众包含有各种不同的阶层，以至不同的阶级。不但如此，在群众中，觉悟程度也时常不一样的，有先进、有中间的、有落后的，因此就会有各种不同的意见。但是在群众场合，他们也就会把各种不同的意见加以比较；而比来比去，就会肯定出一种为大家所共同承认的，或多数所承认的意见。经过群众把各种不同的意见反复讨论（争论）、反复比较之后，最后大家或多数所肯定的意见，往往是最妥当或比较妥当，而错误性是最少或较少的。在群众的反复讨论（争论）、反复比较之后，正确的意见才会突出出来。而正确意见的被肯定，又往往是在讨论中和比较中更加充实起来，并吸收了各种意见中那些可能比较妥当的部分，集中为完整的或比较完整的正确意见。而那些不正确的意见，就会在这争论和集中的过程中淘汰了去。这种经过群众讨论与比较之后所集中起来的意见，乃是当地当时群众觉悟程度发展的尺度，我们办事是须要根据这个尺度办的。离开了这尺度，如果“不及”，就是右的机会主义；如果“太过”，就是“左”的机会主义，或叫做冒险主义，开门主义。一方面，我们不能迁就落后分子，而忽视群众正当的利益（例如雇贫农的利益）；但另一方面，先进阶级或先进分子的意见，需要取得群众多数的同意与拥护（例如雇贫农主动争取中农同意），否则就会陷于孤立。和群众商量，是在各种场合中进行的。个别的谈话，集体的谈话，小座谈，大座谈，不同阶层或不同阶级的谈话等等。只要我们用心，不论在任何场合，都可以启发自己的思想。比如前述静乐圪垛村，关于分配土地的方法，就是一个干部偶然从三个老汉口中的话得到启发，而后再在群众会上展开起来为群众所明确的肯定。当然，对于群众意见采取自流主义的态度也是不对的；领导的人同样的需要把群众那种比较揣摩的方法，化为自己领导的方法。就是把各种不同的意见也加以比较、揣摩，看出它们的不同阶级内容，看出它们的合理或不合理，而加以选择、融会，肯定与否定，联合或斗争，而确定问题，确定政策。通过群众自己，以步步提高群众的觉悟。这就是毛主席所说的：“集中起来，坚持下去”。反复比较、揣摩的方法，这是群众的真正科学分析的方法。这方法，无疑地是需要为我们一切工作者所学习的。有了这样的分析方法，就能够避免个人的冲动与武断；而在任何场合，都可容易避免错误。
    （五）放手走群众的路
    孟子书上有一段话：“左右皆曰贤，未可也。诸大夫皆曰贤，未可也。国人皆曰贤，然后察之；见贤焉，然后用之。左右皆曰不可，勿听。诸大夫皆曰不可，勿听。国人皆曰不可，然后察之；见不可焉，然后去之……。”这段话很好。照我们的情况来说，就是这样：根据干部说的话还不行，根据积极分子说的话也还不行，根据群众说的话就行了。有事只和干部商量是不够的，只和积极分子商量仍是不够的，必须进一步和群众商量。这对于我们干部是极重大极严重的问题。过去许多工作没有做好，就是因为没有认真实行毛主席这种态度、这种方法。我们党的政策，原来是从群众中来的；但是如果我们下级干部没有执行政策的群众路线，有了好政策也是枉然。我们干部必须坚决彻底地抛弃官僚主义的老一套。概括前面所说，可以归列下面几条：（一）大家都齐下决心，真正学习毛主席，当群众的一个小学生，有事和群众商量。（二）信任群众的正确，非群众决定不能解决问题，所以要放手把问题交给群众去讨论和处理。凡是我们的错误，都在群众面前公开承认错误；群众所认为不适当的，决定听凭群众推翻，由群众来重新决定。要根据群众的意见，来改造我们的各种干部与组织。（三）不是硬套公式，而是从当地当时的群众具体情况出发。“根据群众的觉悟程度，去启发与提高群众觉悟。在群众出于内心自愿的原则之下，帮助群众逐步组织起来，逐步地展开为当时当地内外环境所许可的一切必要的斗争。”（见“论联合政府”）（四）我们不是主张尾巴主义或自流主义。而是要善于把群众的意见集中起来，转化为指导群众运动前进的指南针。把群众考察问题和解决问题的方法，转化为我们指导群众的方法。（五）这样就能走到领导方针及领导骨干与群众的一致，能够使得我们这个伟大的为人民服务的党的“每一步骤和每一行动，自然而然地走向使群众革命化”；并将巩固群众由斗争中得来的一切果实。最近有一个工作团从乡下回来，带来了那里一个农民所说的几句话：“政治要放在民间；过去做事情是上头往下灌，现在做事情是要从下往上掏。”这几句话说得真好。我们现在做事情要和群众商量，就是要“从下往上掏”。这就是前面所说的一切。
