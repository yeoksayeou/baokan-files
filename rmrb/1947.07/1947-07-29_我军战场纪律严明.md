Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 26th: The "Wujiang" unit of the People's Liberation Army that recovered Yuncheng truly achieved "entering and leaving the city the same way, without taking any non-military supplies." The Fifth Squad of the Nineteenth Company of this unit registered their personal property before the battle, and the registration form was sent to the company headquarters for safekeeping. After the battle, they asked the company headquarters to send someone to inspect. The Second Machine Gun Squad found 170 silver dollars during the battle, and the Gong Zimei Squad of the First Detachment found three gold rings and two fountain pens, all of which were handed over to the company headquarters. Similarly exemplary deeds were also seen in the Second Platoon of the Sixth Detachment, and others.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 27th: The Eighth Company of a certain unit of the Democratic Allied Army, known as the "Model Loving-the-People Company," has further ensured that they do not violate mass discipline in the current summer offensive. In March of this year, the company hung the "Model Loving-the-People Company" flag, awarded by higher authorities, on the wall of the company headquarters, and the entire company launched a "Protect the Flag Movement." Each squad held "introspection meetings" to examine everyone's thoughts, and a flag celebration was held, establishing a "Flag Protection Pledge," forming a mass movement to abide by mass discipline. Secondly, during a day and night of long-distance marching, the company only ate one meal. The masses along the way offered ready-made meals to the troops, but the soldiers politely refused, feeling that the masses in the newly liberated areas had suffered for a long time under the trampling of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and had difficult lives. Every time the company arrived at a garrison, they reminded everyone to pay attention to the "Flag Protection Pledge," and before departure, they conducted thorough discipline inspections. The masses at the garrison were invariably reluctant to see them leave.

　　我军战场纪律严明
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线二十六日电】收复郓城之解放军“乌江”部真正做到了“怎样进城怎样出城，不拿任何非军用品。”该部十九连五班，战斗前进行个人财产登记，登记表送连部保存，战斗结束后，请连部派人检查，机枪二班，全班在战斗中拾到现洋一百七十元，一分队巩子美班，拾得三个金戒指，两支水笔，全部送交连部，他如六分队一锦二排等亦均有同样模范事迹。
    【新华社东北二十七日电】“拥爱模范连”民主联军某部八连，在此次夏季攻势中，更进一步的做到丝毫不违犯群众纪律。今年三月间该连曾将上级奖励的“拥爱模范连”连旗挂在连部墙壁上，全连展开“保旗运动”，各班召开“反省会”，检查各人思想，并举行祝旗大会，订出“保旗公约”，形成群众性的遵守群众纪律运动。其次该连在一天一夜的长途行军中，只吃一顿饭，沿途群众拿现成的饭给部队吃，战士们因感新解放区群众长期受蒋匪蹂躏，生活困难，都婉言拒绝。该连每到一驻地，即提醒大家注意“保旗公约”出发前进行周密的纪律检查，驻地群众无不依依不舍。
