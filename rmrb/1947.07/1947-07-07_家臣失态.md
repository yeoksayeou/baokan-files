　　A House Servant's Loss of Composure

　　The Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group is now utterly devoid of confidence, and so panic-stricken that not only can others see it, but even the Ta Kung Pao of the Political Science Clique feels it's too unseemly and is worried for him.

　　The Ta Kung Pao published an editorial on June 25th titled "The Government Must Maintain Confidence"; the gist of which was that at a time when the military situation in Northeast and North China is tense and incidents are continuously occurring in Xinjiang and Chahar (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's deliberate rumor that the Soviet Union was helping Outer Mongolia attack China), the government is panicking and constantly appealing to the international community for assistance. This approach indicates the government lacks confidence and will only increase public unease. The government's hasty handling of student protests, including closing newspapers, arresting reporters, and detaining students, has a very negative impact on the United States. The government's anxiety, stimulated by the domestic and international situation, to urgently seek U.S. loans and its cries of whether the U.S. is abandoning China, further give the Americans a bad impression, suggesting the government is desperate for U.S. loans to fight a war, which will ultimately prevent the loans from succeeding.

　　Here, except for the so-called "Xinjiang and Chahar incidents," which were meant to cover up for Chiang Kai-shek, the Ta Kung Pao spoke the truth. The Ta Kung Pao repeatedly pointed out that the "government is panic-stricken," "handling things hastily," and "the government is so anxious," and also pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek's goal is entirely to obtain U.S. loans to fight the war. However, the Ta Kung Pao is ultimately Chiang Kai-shek's house servant, and what it fears is not anything else but that doing so will "make people uneasy" and "prevent the loans from succeeding"; it fears that Chiang Kai-shek's desperation will backfire. On the other hand, the Ta Kung Pao has no sympathy for the people whatsoever. The reason closing newspapers, arresting reporters, and detaining students is bad is only because it has "a very negative impact on the United States." The Ta Kung Pao is sweeping the dust off Chiang Kai-shek's "master's clothes."

　　The Ta Kung Pao has always tried its best to appear as a so-called "liberal" newspaper. It does often criticize the Chiang government, but there are two kinds of criticism: one is the criticism of the democratic constitutionalists, and the other is the criticism of the constitutional monarchists. The Ta Kung Pao is the epitome of the constitutional monarchists. In its bones, it supports Chiang Kai-shek, and it criticizes Chiang Kai-shek in order to support Chiang Kai-shek. The Ta Kung Pao's attitude towards Chiang Kai-shek has always been "criticize in small matters, help in big matters," and its butt is always sitting on Chiang Kai-shek's side. The democratic constitutionalists are completely different from this; they stand on the side of the people. The Ta Kung Pao has served Chiang Kai-shek for many years, putting on a "liberal" guise. It usually criticizes, but when it comes to important junctures, it "saves" Chiang Kai-shek; the Ta Kung Pao has never failed to "explain" Chiang Kai-shek's unforgivable crimes; when Chiang Kai-shek wants to do bad things, the Ta Kung Pao uses its "liberal" facade to prepare public opinion among the masses. The Ta Kung Pao's wonderful use for Chiang Kai-shek's rule is infinite, so it is worthy of the wartime award of 20,000,000 yuan in foreign exchange. Now that the Political Science Clique is in power and controls finance, the Ta Kung Pao can use foreign exchange even more freely.

　　The Ta Kung Pao also often offers Chiang Kai-shek brilliant plans. This June 25th editorial is one of them. What is said in this editorial should normally be "secretly reported" or "personally presented," because it is meant to help Chiang Kai-shek win back the people's hearts and help Chiang Kai-shek find ways to borrow foreign debts to fight a civil war. Such behavior is too ugly to be made public. However, this time, the Ta Kung Pao actually wrote such a secret plan into an editorial and published it publicly. This proves that not only is Chiang Kai-shek already panic-stricken, but even the Ta Kung Pao, Chiang Kai-shek's experienced house servant, has also panicked and lost its composure, committing the major error of disclosing secrets, thus revealing its own fox tail.

### 家臣失态

专栏：新华社时评

　　家臣失态
    蒋介石反动集团现在毫无信心，惊惶失措到如何程度，不但别人都看得出来，连政学系的大公报看了都觉得太不象样，替他着急。
    大公报六月二十五日发表一篇社论，题目叫做“政府要坚定信心”；大意说在东北及华北军事紧张及新疆、察北事态连续发生（按即蒋介石故意造的谣言说苏联帮助外蒙进攻中国）的时候，政府恐慌失措，不断向国际呼吁，希望得到援助，这种办法是表示政府没有信心，会更使人心不安。政府处理学潮措置慌惶，封报馆、捕记者、抓学生，这对美国影响太坏，政府如此着急，以国内外局势为刺激，急求美国贷款，并且喊出美国是否放弃中国的呼声，更给美国人以坏印象，说政府急待美国供给借款来打仗，结果会反使贷款不能成功。
    在这里，大公报除了所谓“新疆、察北事态”一件事为蒋介石掩盖以外，其余都说了真心话。大公报接二连三的指出，“政府惊惶失措”，“措置张惶”，“政府如此焦急”，又指出蒋介石的目的全在求得美国措款来打仗。不过大公报究竟是蒋介石的家臣，他怕的不是别的，而是这样做去“令人心意不安”，“贷款不能成功”；怕的是蒋介石这样一发急，结果适得其反。另一方面，大公报对人民绝无同情心，封报馆、捕记者、抓学生的所以不好，只是“对美国影响太坏”而已，“老爷衣服上有灰尘”，大公报替蒋介石扫灰尘来了。
    大公报曾经竭力装作所谓“自由主义”的报纸，他的确也常常批评蒋政府，不过批评有两种：一种是民主立宪派的批评，另一种是君主立宪派的批评，大公报就是君主立宪派的典型，他在骨子里是拥护蒋介石的，批评蒋介石是为了拥护蒋介石。大公报向来对蒋介石的态度就是“小处批评，大处帮忙”，他的屁股永远是坐在蒋介石那里。民主立宪派与此完全不同，民主立宪派是站在人民这一边的。大公报替蒋介石服务了多年，装起“自由主义”的样子，平常批评，一到重要关节，他就替蒋介石“救驾”；蒋介石的不可饶恕的罪行，大公报无一次不替他“解释”；蒋介石要做坏事，大公报就以“自由主义”的面目替他在群众中做思想准备工作。大公报对于蒋介石统治的妙用是无穷的，所以值得战时二万万元外汇的奖金。现在政学系当政，并掌握了财政，大公报在外汇上更可运用自如了。
    大公报也常常向蒋介石献上锦囊妙计，此次六月二十五日的社论，就是其中之一。象这篇社论中所说的那些，在平时本来应该是“密陈”或“面奏”的，因为他是要帮蒋介石收拾人心，帮助蒋介石设法借到外债来打内战，这种行为公开起来实在太丑恶了。然而这次大公报竟把如此秘密的锦囊妙计写成了社论，公开发表，这证明不仅仅蒋介石已经惊惶失措，就连蒋介石的老练的家臣大公报，自己也已经惊惶而至于失措，犯了披露秘密的大错误，以致露出了自己的狐狸尾巴。
