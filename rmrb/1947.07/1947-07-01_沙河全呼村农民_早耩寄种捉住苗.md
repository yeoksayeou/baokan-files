Farmers of Quanhu Village, Shahe
Early Planting, Seed Embedding, and Protecting the Seedlings

[Reported by this newspaper] In Shahe, there was a rain on the 8th of this month. The masses of Quanhu rushed to plant over 200 mu of millet. All the land that was plowed last year and harrowed several times this year saw growth, totaling 105 mu. Village cadres used this practical experience to discuss with the masses and then proposed, "How should we combat drought in the future?" Hao Tiancheng's group suggested, "The land that was well-harrowed last year could be planted with a little rain this year. Isn't this a lesson for us? Now that it can't be planted because of the rain, let's harrow the land first, and we can plant as soon as it rains." Cui Ji said, "Dig the land into dry kilns, and corn can grow with just a little rain." He also said, "It's good to plant early when it's dry. When planting, don't cover the seeds well with the planting tool, attach three broken shoe pieces, and when planting, the shoe pieces will pull over, covering the millet grains with a thin layer of soil. If it rains a little, harrow it once to loosen the topsoil, and it will grow." All the groups accepted this suggestion and experimented. Fortunately, on the 16th night (lunar calendar), there was a little rain, and 100 mu of millet all sprouted. Everyone was very happy. After discussion, it was decided that each household should plant one mu of millet, so that they can survive a famine. Now, the slogan of "rescuing seedlings" has been proposed, ensuring that not a single seedling dies. This reduces the threat of drought to the masses, and production enthusiasm has greatly increased.

[Reported by this newspaper] In Neiqiu's Nanbaizhi, responding to the call from higher authorities during the four or five years of drought resistance, all the dry land benefited from dry planting. This year, they accepted the experience of previous years in the drought resistance effort. Zhang Zhenxiu's group took the lead, and the production committee immediately convened all mutual aid group leaders to conduct research and then asked the masses to discuss how to dry plant. Everyone competed to say, "Our village responded to the call from higher authorities in the fourth and fifth years and benefited greatly from planting over 90 mu of millet in dry land. That year, the rain came late, and the dry-planted millet sprouted three days earlier than the rain-planted millet. This year, we will accept that year's experience." Everyone decided: We must carry out dry planting. The three groups in the village, with cadres participating in each group to organize and lead. After the meeting, Zhang Zhenxiu's group took the lead. The whole group of ten full and semi-laborers, six animal powers, completed 38 mu of dry land planting in three days. Under the influence of his group's lead, the seven-day large mutual aid completed 54 mu of dry land planting and 18 mu of water carrying planting. Except for the previously planted land, only 2.7 mu of uncultivated land and more than 20 mu of planted land remain. They are now carrying water to water the cotton.

　　沙河全呼村农民
  　早耩寄种捉住苗
    【本报讯】沙河在本月八日下了一场雨，全呼群众抢种了二百多亩谷子，凡是去年犁过今年耙过几遍的都上来了，共成了一百○五亩。村干部拿这个实际经验让群众讨论，然后提出：“咱们今后怎样抗旱？”郝天成组提出：“去年打耙好的地，今年少下点雨就能耩，这不是给咱的经验教训吗？现在天下雨不能种，咱先把地打耙好，天一下雨就能耩。”崔计的说：“把地刨成旱窑，下一指多雨点上玉茭就能上。”又说：“先旱耩上也好，耩时耧腿上不带掩好棒，带上三个破鞋片，‘将’上了，鞋片拉过去，谷粒上薄薄盖了些土，天如果下一指雨，马上耢一遍，使地皮松一些就能上来。”各个小组接受了这个意见都纷纷试验，可巧十六日夜（阴历）下了一指半雨，一百亩谷子都上来了，大家很高兴，经大家讨论，决定每家种上一亩谷，万一遇灾荒也能保住命根。现在提出：“抢救幼苗”的口号，已按上的苗不让死一棵，这样减低了旱灾对群众威胁，生产情绪大大的提高。
    【本报讯】内邱南白芷四五年抗旱中响应上级号召，全部旱地干种沾了光，今年在抗旱中接受了前年的经验，张振秀组打了头一炮，生产委员会即召开各互助组长作了研究，随即叫群众讨论，怎样干种点种，大家争着说：“咱村在四五年响应上级号召、干地寄种谷九十多亩沾过大光，那年下雨晚了，干种的比等雨种的早出三天。今年接受那年经验。”大家决定：一定要开展干种点种，全村三个组，干部分头参加到每个组里组织领导。会后张振秀组起了带头，全组十个整半劳力，六个畜力，三天完成三十八亩干地寄种，在他组的带头影响下，七天大互助，完成干地寄种五十四亩，担水点种十八亩，除去过去已点种的外，未播种地只有二亩七分，和二十多亩耩地，现正在进行担水浇棉花。
