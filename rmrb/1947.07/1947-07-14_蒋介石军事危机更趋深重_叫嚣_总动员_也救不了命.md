Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th. Starting from the 4th of this month, the bandit Chiang Kai-shek launched a counter-revolutionary so-called "total mobilization" in his controlled areas. On the 4th, the Kuomintang government, through Chiang's "submitted for discussion" total mobilization proposal, Chiang himself published another long and stinking "Chiang Eight-legged Essay" on the "July 7th" anniversary. His civil and military lackeys, such as Zhang Qun, Chen Cheng, and Sun Ke, followed with their speeches. Political beggars like Yu Jiaju and Chen Qitian of the Youth Party, and Zhang Junmai and Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party, also chimed in.

What does this total mobilization signify? Let the Americans and Chinese reactionaries speak for themselves: An Associated Press dispatch from Peiping on the 8th, reflecting the observations of American military personnel on the current situation, said: "Foreign military figures closely watching the Chinese civil war say that Nanjing's total mobilization is quite important, because this is the first public admission that the government's military is in a serious state, and the anti-Communist war has been ineffective. Six months ago, the National Army had a total of five million men, mostly equipped with the most modern American aircraft. The natural conclusion to be drawn from the total mobilization order is that, due to the losses of the war, this huge machine is still insufficient to achieve its goals." Chiang Kai-shek himself also saw the seriousness of the military crisis. He said that the People's Liberation Army's offensive in the Northeast was "of unprecedented scale." He panicked and shouted: "Today's Northeast and North China are the future of Central and South China." The situation on the front lines is so bad, and the situation behind Chiang Kai-shek is also not good. Chiang Kai-shek said in his "July 7th" speech: "In our rear, especially in major cities in Central and South China, there are still many people... who either take chances and tolerate, or live in a perfunctory manner," "losing confidence," "standing idly by," and becoming "paralyzed." The Associated Press also described the same situation, saying: "The people do not seem to be very happy about military victories, nor are they very discouraged by military defeats." This still refers to the civil and military officials under Chiang Kai-shek; as for the people, according to Chiang Kai-shek, they actually "put forward various slogans such as opposing grain requisition, opposing conscription, and opposing civil war." Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Cheng's assessment of the situation is that the Chinese reactionaries have now encountered an "unprecedented" "national crisis." Chiang Kai-shek himself admitted that his rule would be a "destroyed nest," saying that he had reached a "serious crisis" and would reach a time when he would "beg for life but not get it, and beg for death but not be able to." The main purpose of Chiang Kai-shek's "total mobilization" is to "awaken" the "vigilance" of the reactionaries and to "concentrate" the "will and strength" of the reactionaries. Where to concentrate it? According to Chiang Kai-shek, it is to concentrate on "suppressing the Communists and building the country." An Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 5th criticized this point, saying: "Chiang's plan requires all-out efforts to carry out the anti-Communist war on the one hand, and to seek national construction on the other. Most foreigners in China believe that this task is beyond the capabilities of the Chiang government."

Another aspect of "total mobilization" is that the Chiang clique will carry out bloody suppression of those who oppose the civil war, which is what Chiang Kai-shek called "stabilizing social order" in his "proposal." Chiang Kai-shek's intention was made simple and clear by his lackey Sun Ke: "Opposing the civil war is opposing the government, and this is naturally intolerable. We will take decisive measures. You may wish to convey this meaning to the Democratic League." (Central News Agency)

"Total mobilization" for the common people in the Chiang-controlled areas means money, food, and lives. The Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries still want to hide this simple truth, but the Associated Press cannot but admit that "Nanjing has issued a total mobilization order," and "the Chinese people (referring to the Chiang-occupied areas) face new suffering. This order requires from the country things not yet disclosed, but in the terrifying vista are increased taxes and further conscription." (Shanghai dispatch on the 5th)

In order to beg for assistance from the American foreign father, Chiang Kai-shek himself even said: "Everyone knows that before Japan surrendered, there were no bandits in the Northeast," and also said: "How the Communist bandits entered the Northeast, and how the troops participating in the rebellion in the Northeast were organized and succeeded, is all well known." He completely erased the heroic history of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army's 14 years of arduous struggle and shot a dark arrow at the Soviet Union. He also fabricated a lot of ridiculous rumors to slander the Communist liberated areas and the People's Liberation Army, proving that all the anti-Soviet and anti-Communist rumors of the Kuomintang Central News Agency in the past originated from Chiang Kai-shek's personal instructions.

The most interesting thing in Chiang Kai-shek's "total mobilization" is that Chen Cheng put forward evidence that Chiang Kai-shek was the culprit of the civil war. According to Chiang Kai-shek, he only "decided to quell the rebellion" "since October last year," and said: "For ten years, especially in the past year or so, the government has always been painstakingly tolerant and seeking compromise with the Communist Party." ("July 7th" speech) However, Chen Cheng, the "straw bag," revealed all of Chiang Kai-shek's dogmatic nonsense about the stages of the Chinese revolution, which Chiang Kai-shek "usually showed" them. According to Chiang Kai-shek's two-stage theory, the period before Japan's surrender was the "early stage," and the period after Japan's surrender was the "later stage." The "revolutionary objects" in the later stage are the "Communist bandits" and the so-called "feudal remnants," and he said that this was Chiang Kai-shek's "foresight and vision." (Message to Officers and Soldiers and Message to Young People) It can be seen that Chiang Kai-shek's civil war policy was determined "usually" long ago. Therefore, all the "political solutions" and "seeking compromise" from Chiang Kai-shek's mouth are all lies. Chen Cheng's "military report" on "July 7th" alone can expose all of Chiang Kai-shek's deceptions, because Chen Cheng openly admitted that Chiang Kai-shek had launched a large-scale civil war last year (July), and that attacking northern Jiangsu in July was "to make it difficult for the bandits to supply food," and attacking Zhangjiakou in October was "to destroy the bandit's military factories and cut off the bandit's replenishment." So who launched the civil war is not clear?

Although Chiang Kai-shek shouted "total mobilization" hoarsely, even the Americans doubted its effectiveness. The Associated Press published the opinions of "most observers" in Shanghai the day after the Kuomintang government passed the "total mobilization order," "believing that the practical significance of the order is less than its symbolic significance, because an open civil war has been going on for several months before the order was issued." The agency's dispatch from Peiping on the 8th was even more pessimistic. It said: "The Communist army may strive to gain military control most effectively before the end of this summer. Observers here believe that if this is the case, the measures taken by Nanjing now may be too late." Chiang Kai-shek's demise is already certain, and "total mobilization" cannot save his fate.

### 蒋介石军事危机更趋深重  叫嚣“总动员”也救不了命

    蒋介石军事危机更趋深重
    叫嚣“总动员”也救不了命
    新华社陕北十二日电本月四日起，蒋贼介石在其统治区发动了一个反革命的所谓“总动员”，四日国民党政府通过蒋贼“交议”的总动员提案，蒋贼自己在“七七”发表了又长又臭的蒋八股，他的文武喽罗张群、陈诚、孙科之流，接着发表谈话，政治乞丐青年党余家菊、陈启天，民社党张君劢、蒋匀田之辈，也在旁边帮腔一阵。
    这个总动员表现什么意义呢？让美国人与中国反动派自己来说吧：美联社八日北平电反映美国军人对时局的观察说：“密切注视中国内战之外籍军方人士称，南京之总动员颇为重要，因为这是第一次公开承认政府军事处于严重势态，反共战争迄无效果。六个月前国军共有五百万人，多系为最现代美机所装备。对总动员令得出自然的结论是：由于战争的损失，此一庞大机器仍不足达到其目标。”蒋介石自己也看出了军事危机之严重，他说：人民解放军在东北的攻势“规模之大，前所未有”。他惊慌的喊道：“今天的东北、华北就是华中、华南的将来。”前线的情况如此不妙，而蒋介石后力的情况也是不妙。蒋贼在“七七”演说中说：“在我们后方，尤其是华中、华南各大都市，还有许多人……或侥幸姑息，或苟且偷安”，“丧失了信心”，“袖手旁观”，成了“麻痹状态”。美联社也描写这同样的情形说：“人民似乎对军事胜利没有多大的高兴，对于军事失败也没有很大的沮丧。”这还是指蒋介石手下的文武官员而言；至于人民则照蒋介石说：居然“提出反对征粮，反对征兵，反对内战等各种口号”。蒋介石、陈诚对局势的估计，是中国反动派现在已遇到了“前所未有”的“国难”。蒋贼自认他的统治将为“覆巢”，说他已到了“严重危机”，将要到“求生不得，求死不能”的时候。蒋贼的“总动员”主要目的就是，要“唤起”反动派的“警觉”，要“集中”反动派的“意志与力量”。集中到那里去呢？据蒋贼说：是集中到“剿共与建设”。美联社五日上海电对于这点又批评说：“蒋之计划，要求一方面全力进行反共战争，另一方面则求国家之建设，大部分外国在华人士认为，此项任务非蒋政府能力所及。”
    “总动员”的另外一面，是蒋集团将对反对内战的人士进行血腥的镇压，也就是蒋贼“提案”中所谓“安定社会秩序”。蒋贼的意旨尤其走狗孙科讲得简单明了：“反对内战即反对政府，对此自难容忍，必将采取断然措置，诸君不妨以此意转告民盟。”（中央社）
    “总动员”对于蒋管区的老百姓就是要钱、要粮、要命。这个简单道理，蒋介石反动派还想把它掩藏起来，美联社不能不承认“南京下了总动员令”，“中国人民（应指蒋占区）面临了新的苦难。此命令要求于该国国家的尚未泄露但在恐怖之远景中是提高征税与进一步征兵。”（五日上海电）
    为了要讨乞到美国洋爸爸的援助，蒋贼自己竟曾说：“大家都知道在日本投降前，东北是没有匪军的”，又说：“共匪怎样进入东北的，他在东北参加叛变的部队又是怎样组织成功的，这都是尽人皆知的。”他竟完全抹煞东北义勇军十四年艰苦奋斗的英雄历史，把一支暗箭射向苏联。在污蔑共产党解放区和人民解放军上面，他也造出大堆可笑的谣言，证明以往国民党中央社的一切反苏反共的谣言原来都出于蒋贼亲自指使。
    蒋贼“总动员”中最有趣的事，就是由陈诚提出了蒋贼是内战祸首的证据。照蒋贼所说是：“自去年十月以来”才“决心戡乱”，并说：“十年以来，尤其在过去一年多时间，政府对共产党始终是苦心忍让，委曲求全。”（‘七七’演说）但是，“草包”陈诚却把蒋贼“平日昭示”他们的狗屁胡说的中国革命之阶段论，和盘托出来了。依照蒋贼的两阶段论，日本投降以前为“前期”，日本投降以后为“后期”。后期的“革命对象”即为“共匪”与所谓“封建余孽”，并说这是蒋贼的“远瞩高瞻”。（告官兵书及告青年书）可见蒋贼之内战政策“平日”老早定下来了。因此，听有蒋贼口中“政治解决”，“委曲求全”等等，全是假话。单就陈诚“七七”的“军事报告”，也可以把蒋贼的欺骗全部揭开，因为陈诚公开承认去年（七月）蒋贼已发动大规模内战，七月进攻苏北乃“使匪之食粮供应困难”，十月进攻张家口乃“破坏匪军需工厂，使匪补充断绝”，则内战由谁发动不是清清楚楚吗？
    蒋贼虽然声嘶力竭的喊“总动员”，但其效果连美国人也发生怀疑。美联社在国民党政府通过“总动员令”之次日，即发表上海“大部分观察家”的意见，“认为该命令之实际意义不如象征的意义为多，因在该命令发布之前，公开之内战已进行数月之久。”该社八日北平电讯则更为悲观，它说：“共军可能将在今夏结束前，最有力地争取军事控制权。此间观察家认为假如如此的话，南京现在采取的措施可能已经晚了。”蒋贼的灭亡，已经确定，“总动员”也挽救不了他的命运。
