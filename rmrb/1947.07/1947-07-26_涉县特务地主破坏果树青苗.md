　　[Report from Shexian] Recently in Shexian, it was discovered that landlords were sabotaging production and relief efforts. In Nanzhuang, District One, special agents spread rumors, saying, "The people of Nanzhuang are discontent, it rains all around, but the center stays clear." This weakened the masses' confidence in fighting drought. They also stripped the bark off seven persimmon trees, leaving them bare, and damaged corn seedlings and pumpkins. In Yaoze Village, District Four, the three Guo ShiMing brothers secretly cut one mu of seedlings from honest peasant Jiang KuiShun's field. Around Jingdian, many fruit tree barks were also stripped. In Nanguokou, District Three, thirty-six fruit trees were also found with their bark stripped by landlord special agents. These acts of sabotage have aroused the vigilance of the masses, who are now monitoring and fighting against the special agents and landlords.

    [Report] On the afternoon of the 25th of last month, GuoBao Village in Huguan’s Second District, experienced a sudden hailstorm, with hailstones as large as fists and eggs. The seedlings were completely destroyed, and the masses' morale was low. However, landlords Yan BaoRen, Ju DeBao, and Niu XiaoZe were happily jumping around, complaining that the hailstones were too small. At that time, the family member of a soldier said: It would have been better not to exchange other people's land (referring to exchanging the landlord's land). Cadres immediately led the masses in discussion, exposing the landlords' conspiracies to exploit the situation and sabotage, raising the masses' confidence in overcoming the disaster. More than 300 mu of wheat fields in the village were completely replanted with buckwheat, barley, and vegetables. The masses put forward the slogan: "Not a single piece of land will be left empty, we will not listen to the landlords' talk."
　　　　　
　　　　　　　(Production and Disaster Relief Report)
    [Report] Guo QingChi, a landlord from GuoHai in GuanCheng's Second District, had a daughter who was the wife of someone in ShangWu Village, District One. During the struggle against the landlord in ShangWu Village, his reactionary old accounts were found in Guo QingChi's daughter's luggage. The account book recorded the names of those who made suggestions during struggles, who had divided his property, and who had divided his land, all written in detail. It also contained several sentences in which Guo QingChi swore to Heaven: "Enmity as vast as the heavens must be avenged. Revenge and wiping out the humiliation is what makes a great man. Hatred unavenged is inhuman." The village cadres and masses of GuoHai were shocked when they saw the reactionary old accounts, finally realizing how cruel the landlords' hearts were. Zhang YiTing, a landlord from ChengXi Street in District One, was the owner of XiangTai Store. During the democratic livelihood struggle and land reform, Zhang YiTing always appeared as an "enlightened landlord." In every struggle, he voluntarily offered land and contributed funds, numbing the masses' hatred towards him. The cadres and masses of Xi Street all said: Zhang YiTing is an "enlightened landlord." Zhang YiTing gained the title of "enlightened," and openly promoted that his father came from a poor background and was "kind" and "compassionate." He secretly dispersed his wealth to villages such as ShanGu, LaoWa Zhang, Chen Village, QingFeng ZiYang, and Li Family. Taking advantage of the masses' inattention last year, he bought a house for 140,000 yuan, and sold two gold rings, then spent the money on eating, drinking, and wasteful activities, calling himself "profligate by nature." This reinvestigation exposed his false enlightenment and unearthed his "air-raid shelter." (GuanCheng Emancipation Report)
