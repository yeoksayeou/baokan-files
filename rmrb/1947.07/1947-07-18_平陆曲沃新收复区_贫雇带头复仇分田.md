[Transmitted from Taiyue on the 16th by this newspaper] In the new districts of southern Shanxi, such as Quwo and Pinglu counties, land reform is unfolding vigorously, with poor and hired peasants as the backbone, uniting all peasants. Beizheng Village in the fourth district of Quwo was the first village in the county last year to break through with grievance airing and revenge. The local tyrants and landlords were severely beaten, and the masses were more awakened. The "village compilation" and "reverse settlement" were also the most serious after being reoccupied by the enemy last winter. In addition to all the peasants being subjected to double "reverse settlement," eleven activists were imprisoned, and the families of sixteen peasant association members were detained in the "compiled villages," causing the peasants to have concerns. After the liberation of Quwo City, cadres went to the village to resume work, and used the thirty-odd households of hired and poor peasants who had moved with our army as the backbone to unite and mobilize all the peasants to rise up for revenge. They went deep into the masses day and night, colluding to mobilize and brew up, and led the militia across the Fen River to arrest the "reverse settlement" ringleader, the He brothers, using their resolute actions to lead everyone to retaliate against the "reverse settlement" ringleaders. At the grievance airing and revenge meeting on June 16th, those who took the lead in charging were all hired and poor peasants, gradually promoting the resolute struggle of the middle peasants, completely eliminating ideological concerns among the masses. Dongyan Village in Pinglu is the village with the greatest feudal power in the second district, and the work team failed to open up the situation several times. Finally, a training class for hired and poor peasants was convened, with eighty men and forty-two women participating. In the four days of heart-to-heart talks, they unearthed the root of their poverty, and their life-long suffering aroused their fighting spirit. On the fifth day, they took the lead in opening fire on the feudal forces, first knocking down the feudal demon king of the village, "Three Great Kings". On the sixth day, the masses saw that the feudal forces had fallen and joined the struggle one after another. On the seventh day, the entire village came to accuse "Three Great Kings", and the struggle began vigorously. In the movement, they were good at grasping the emotions of the masses and strengthening leadership. After each day's struggle, they held a "rectification" meeting that evening to commend activists and review shortcomings. They called it "fighting on one hand and training soldiers on the other," gradually raising the awareness of the masses, promoting the movement, and uniting 90% of the peasants in the village. According to statistics, out of 187 households in the village, apart from feudal landlords and bullies, 165 households participated in the struggle.

[Transmitted from Taiyue on the 16th by this newspaper] The Fen River area of ​​Xinjiang is ablaze with struggle, and 46 villages have preliminarily distributed land. In the first, second, and sixth districts of Fannan County, land reform movements have been widely carried out, eliminating 110 landlords. The peasants have recovered more than 14,000 mu of land, more than 1,000 houses, more than 1,000 dan of grain, more than 100 livestock, and the hard-earned money and farming tools have been reasonably distributed to landless and land-poor peasants. 3,557 members of peasant associations and 429 militiamen have been developed and restored, laying a solid foundation for the Fannan area.
