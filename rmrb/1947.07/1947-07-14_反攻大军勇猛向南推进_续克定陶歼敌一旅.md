    Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, July 12th: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army under the command of General Liu Bocheng, on the evening of the 10th, forcefully recovered the city of Dingtao, annihilating the 153rd Brigade of the 63rd Division of the Kuomintang army. This is another victory for the People's Liberation Army since crossing the river in a counter-offensive, following the capture of Yuncheng and the annihilation of two brigades of the 55th Division of the Kuomintang army. The People's Liberation Army launched a general offensive at 8 PM and concluded the battle at 12 AM. The results are currently being tallied. Dingtao is the fifth county town liberated by the People's Liberation Army since the counter-offensive began.
    Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, July 11th: Our correspondent Li Pu reports: The reporter accompanied a certain unit under the command of General Liu Bocheng on a boat crossing the river on the evening of the 4th, taking only five minutes. Sailors from eight counties along the coast participated in the river crossing work. Since the People's Liberation Army began crossing the river, Chiang Kai-shek's planes have frequently harassed day and night, but have not been able to stop the advance of our army. There are two types of boats, large and small, which began to be built last November. The large ones can carry two ten-wheeled trucks, and the small ones can carry thirty to forty people. The sailors excitedly talked about the moving scene on the evening of the 30th: that day, when they first transported the commando team, everyone was quietly and nervously working. The river bank watched the clock, from the time the boat sailed to the time the commando team arrived on the other side and fired a signal gun, it was exactly five minutes. Many crossings were carried out under heavy fire, but this crossing was defended by a part of Chiang's army and the "Homecoming Corps." Chiang's army fled quickly, while Chiang Kai-shek's loyal running dogs, the "Homecoming Corps," were still dreaming; by the time they realized what was happening, they had already been taken prisoner. In this way, the People's Liberation Army shattered the Yellow River's natural barrier, which Chiang Kai-shek boasted about as equal to 400,000 troops, in just five minutes. When the reporter talked to the sailors about Chiang Kai-shek's myth, they all laughed heartily. They are all old hands at riding the waves on the Yellow River, and most of them were militiamen during the Anti-Japanese War. In this great historical event, they launched a campaign to earn merit, seeing who's boat was faster and who crossed the river more times. Ten years ago, they sailed their boats between Jinan and Kaifeng. They said: when these two places are liberated, there will be business to do, and the Yellow River will become active again.

    反攻大军勇猛向南推进
    续克定陶歼敌一旅
    新华社冀鲁豫前线十二日电刘伯承将军麾下人民解放军某部，于十日晚强攻收复定陶城，歼灭蒋军六十三师一百五十三旅；此乃解放军渡河反攻以来继攻克郓城歼灭蒋军五十五师两个旅后之又一胜利。解放军于下午八时发动总攻，十二时解决战斗，战果正清查中。按定陶为解放军反攻以来光复之第五座县城。
    新华社冀鲁豫前线十一日电  本社记者李普报导：记者于四日晚随刘伯承将军麾下某部乘船渡河，费时仅五分钟。沿岸八个县的水手，都参加了渡河的工作。目从解放军开始渡河以来，蒋介石飞机日夜骚扰频繁，但并未能阻止我大军的前进。船只分大小两种，于去年十一月开始建造，大的可以载运十轮大汽车两辆，小的可以载运三、四十人。水手们兴奋的谈说三十号晚上的动人情景：那天第一次载运突击队的时候，大家悄悄紧张的动作着。河这边看着表，从开船到突击队抵达对岸放信号枪，恰恰是五分种。有许多渡口是在猛烈的炮火下强渡的，但这个渡口是由一部分蒋军和“还乡团”防守的，蒋军们逃得很快，而蒋介石的忠实走狗“还乡团”们还在做梦；等到他们晓得的时候，已经作了俘虏。解放军就是这样在五分钟之内粉碎了为蒋介石所吹嘘的黄河天险等于四十万大军的神话。当记者和水手们谈起蒋介石这个神话时，他们莫不哈哈大笑。他们都是黄河上乘风破浪的老把式，大部分在抗战期间当过民兵。在这个创造历史的伟大事件中，他们展开了立功运动，看谁的船快，谁渡的次数多。十年前他们驶着船往来济南开封间，他们说：等到把这两个地方解放后，就有生意做，黄河又要活跃起来了。
