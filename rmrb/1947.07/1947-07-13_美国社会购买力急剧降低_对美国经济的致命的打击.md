The source of market prosperity lies in abundant social purchasing power.

Currently, the United States is increasingly facing an economic crisis. In this situation, what is the state of social purchasing power in the United States? To answer this question, we should study the following four points:

First, the productivity of the United States has increased unprecedentedly since the war. Last year's total production value reached 205 billion U.S. dollars, almost doubling the total production value of the peak year during the war. However, judging from the increase in the number of employed people, the rate of increase is not as large as the increase in total production value. The number of employed people in the peak year during the war was 55 million, while the total number of employed people last year increased by only one million compared to the peak year during the war—to 56 million.

According to the increase in American productivity, American capitalists needed to pay the wages of three people to complete a commodity before the war. During the war, they only needed to pay the wages of one person to complete the same item. But after the war, to complete the same item, they don't even need to pay the full wages of one person. Therefore, the total value of wages paid by American capitalists will decrease. Due to the devaluation of wages and unemployment of the largest part of the population (workers), social purchasing power has been greatly reduced.

Second, unprecedentedly huge military spending: This year's (from July 1st of last year to June 30th of this year) U.S. military expenditure is extremely large. Although the U.S. government announced in early May last year that Truman submitted to Congress a military budget of 7,204,635,520 U.S. dollars, the actual expenditure is far more than this figure. First of all, judging from the official announcement of the United States: this budget has fallen short and is not enough to pay for expenses. On July 21st of last year, the U.S. Senate passed a naval appropriation bill, stipulating that more than 4.15 billion U.S. dollars would only be used to maintain the navy's expenses; if we add the expenses to maintain an army of 1.07 million, as well as the expenses to expand an air force of 1 million, it is very obvious that the figure of 7.244 billion U.S. dollars cannot pay for them. Therefore, Truman openly admitted that the "U.S. News" weekly's estimate that the United States would reduce overspending by 6.3 billion U.S. dollars this year was due to "maintaining a huge army." According to Moscow commentator Marinin's estimate of this year's U.S. military expenditure: the United States' "military expenditure exceeds more than ten times that of peacetime." What comes from the sheep comes from the sheep's body. Such huge expenditure will be borne by the American people. Therefore, a portion of the purchasing power of the American people will inevitably vanish under all kinds of indirect and direct transfers.

Third, rising prices and inflation: Prices in the United States have been rising since the war. Although there was a slight downward trend at the beginning of this year, it quickly rebounded under the method of American capitalists temporarily storing goods to create a market shortage of goods.

The increase is as follows: at the end of last year, U.S. prices approximately doubled in the year and a half since the end of the war; from the cancellation of price controls last November to March and April of this year, in less than half a year, the wholesale prices of general commodities increased by 23 percent, and the market retail prices far exceeded this number; and food prices increased by 55 percent. Comparing prices in April of this year with prices at the same time last year, the wholesale prices of 900 kinds of commodities were 34 percent higher than at the same time last year.

Following prices is the problem of inflation. As long as prices rise, it will inevitably lead to inflation. And inflation stimulates prices to rise even more.

Due to the rapid rise in prices and inflation, the purchasing power of savings accumulated by the American people during the war is rapidly being exhausted. Therefore, "civil servants, widows, veterans, families in small towns and villages in American cities," etc., cannot but be forced to "use limited savings, sell wartime securities, are unable to seek medical treatment when sick, and borrow money from everyone they meet," and the number of American borrowers in this year is "more than 50 percent more than the number a year ago" (according to a revelation from the US News Agency on April 22).

Fourth, the cancellation of overtime wages: The income of American workers has decreased. After the end of the war, the wartime wage of 45 cents per hour was not enough to cope with the post-war standard of living. The cancellation of overtime wages has further reduced the income of American workers, reducing it by 43 cents per week. In this way, it was impossible to maintain a living even in January of last year, when prices had not yet risen sharply. Although the hourly wage was later increased to 62 cents, the tide rises and the boat floats. Wages increased by 30 percent, while prices increased by more than 130 percent. According to the standard of living in the first half of last year, the minimum living expenses for American workers (calculated based on a family of two and a half) required 1,950 U.S. dollars per year, but calculated based on an hourly wage of 65 cents, the total annual income was only 1,300 U.S. dollars; compared with the two, there was a difference of 650 U.S. dollars. According to this year's standard of living, the living expenses that are lacking should be even greater.

This explicit or implicit, absolute or relative reduction in the wages of American workers is also one of the most important factors in the decline of social purchasing power in the United States.

The purchasing power of American society is being reduced greatly and rapidly under various forms of exploitation, which, as Truman believes, is "a fatal blow to the foundation of American prosperity." The facts are very clear: an unprecedented economic crisis is inevitable!

### 美国社会购买力急剧降低——对美国经济的致命的打击

    美国社会购买力急剧降低——对美国经济的致命的打击
    市场繁荣的源泉，为丰沛之社会购买力。
    目前，美国正日益迫临经济危机。在此情况下，美国之社会购买力又是如何呢？为了回答这一问题，我们应当从下面四点去研究：
    第一、战后美国的生产力空前的提高了：去年全年的生产总值，竟达两千零五十亿美元，较之战争期间最高一年的生产总值，几乎增加了一倍。但从其就业人数的增加来看：其增加速度则不如生产总值增加之速度为大。战争期间最高一年的就业人数为五千五百万，而去年全年的就业人数，较之战时最高一年的就业人数，仅增加了一百万人——为五千六百万人。
    按照美国生产力的增高情况，美国资本家在战前为完成一件商品，需付出三个人的工资；在战时，为了完成同样的一件物品，则只需付出一个人的工资就够了；但在战后，为完成同样的一件物品，就连一个人的工资，也不需要全部予以付出了。所以，美国资本家所付出的工资总值就会减少。由于占人口最大部分的工人工资贬低及失业，社会购买力也就大大减少了。
    第二、空前庞大的军费支出：本年度（自上年七月一日起至本年六月三十日止）的美国军费是十分庞大的。虽然美国官方曾于去年五月初宣布了杜鲁门送交国会之军事预算额为七十二万万四千六百三十五万五千二百美元。但实际上的支出是远不止此数的。首先就美国的官方宣布来说：这一预算已经落空，已经不够支付。去年七月二十一日美参院曾通过海军拨款案，规定以四十一亿五千余万美元，仅作为维持海军的经费；如再加上维持百零七万的陆军，以及扩充百万空军的经费，很显然的：则断非七十二亿四千余万美元的数字所可支付。因此，“美国新闻”周刊所估计的本年度美国减少超支六十三亿美元一事，杜鲁门亦公然不讳的承认系由于“维持庞大的军队”所致了。另据莫斯科评论员马里宁对本年度美国军事支出的估计：美国“军费比过去和平时期超过十倍。”羊毛出在羊身上，这样浩大的支出，是要由美国人民来负担的。因此，美国人民的一部分购买力，势必将在种种间接直接转嫁下化为乌有。
    第三、物价上升与通货膨胀：战后美国的物价是在上升着。虽然在今年初曾一度略有下跌之势，但旋即在美国资本家用暂时储存商品以制造市场商品奇缺的办法下，而又迅速回涨上去。
    其上涨情形：去年年底美国物价较之战争结束时，在一年半中间约涨一倍；自去年十一月物价管制取消以后至今年三四月间，半年不到，一般商品批发价格上涨百分之二十三，市场零售价格又远超过此数；而食物价格则上涨百分之五十五。如以今年四月间与去年同时物价价格相较，则有九百种商品的批发价格，高出于去年同时百分之三十四。
    跟在物价之后的，是通货膨胀问题。物价只要上升，就必然会招致通货膨胀。而通货膨胀就刺激物价更加上升。
    由于物价急涨及通货膨胀，美国人民在战时储蓄的购买力正在迅速消耗净尽。因此，美国的“公教人员、寡妇、退役军人、美国城市小镇乡村里的家庭”等等，不能不被迫“动用有限储蓄，卖出战时证券，有病不能就医，逢人便举债”，而美国借债人的数目，在今年，“比起一年前的数目，多过百分之五十”（据美新闻处四月二十二日透露）。
    第四、逾时的工资取消：美工人收入减少，战争结束后，战时每小时四角五分的工资，不足以应付战后的生活程度了。逾时工资的取消，使美国工人的收入更加减少，每周就少四角三分。这样，就在物价还未大涨的去年一月间，已无法维持生活。虽然，后来每时工资增加至六角二分，但是水涨船高，工资增加了百分之三十，而物价则增加了百分之一百三十以上。就按去年上半年生活程度，美国工人最低生活费（按两口半的家庭计算），全年需一千九百五十美元，但照每小时工资六角五分计算，全年才有一千三百元；两者相较，尚差六百五十元。如按照今年的生活程度，则所差的生活费当更多了。
    美国工人的工资这种明的或暗的，绝对的或相对的减少，亦是美国社会购买力降低的最重要的因素之一。
    美国社会的购买力在种种的剥蚀之下，大量而急剧的降低着，这就如杜鲁门所认为的：“对美国繁荣的基础是致命的打击”。事实已很显然：一个空前的经济大危机，是不可避免的了！
