Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: Paris dispatch: After Ramadier obtained a "miserable" vote of confidence from the right wing in Parliament, he is now facing even greater dissatisfaction from the working class. The "Government Employees Union," uniting workers from all administrative organs, police, social engineering, aviation, economic and other departments, and possessing over one million members, recently issued an ultimatum to Ramadier, demanding a wage increase. Ramadier agreed to respond to their demands on the 10th. The Union's strike committee ordered that if Ramadier has not responded to all of the workers' demands by the 12th, a strike will be held on the 12th. Paris subway and local tram workers announced on the 7th that they stand in solidarity with the "Government Employees Union" and reiterated their demand for wage increases. On the same day, workers and technicians at naval and air force arsenals also announced that if they do not receive a temporary wage increase of 1,000 francs by the 11th, they will go on strike. The Congress of the Postal Workers Federation convened on the 8th to discuss strike matters.

    法国职工对拉马第更为不满
    增资运动再度高涨
    【新华社陕北十日电】巴黎讯：拉马第在议会获得右派“凄惨的”信任以后，现在却面临着工人阶级更大的不满。团结了全部行政机构、警务、社会工程、航空、经济等部门工人，拥有一百余万会员的“政府雇员联盟”，日前向拉马第提出最后通牒，要求增加工资。拉马第允许于十日答复他们的要求。联盟罢工委员会下令，如拉马第在十二日以前尚未答复工人的全部要求，即在十二日举行罢工。巴黎地下交通与地方电车工人七日宣布与“政府雇员联盟”团结一致，并再次提出其增资要求。同日，海空军兵工厂工人与技师亦宣布，如不能于十一日以前得到一千法郎的临时增资，则将举行罢工。邮工联合会代表大会于八日开会，讨论罢工事宜。
