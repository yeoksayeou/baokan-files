　　Taihang Fifth Sub-district Establishes Women's Federation
  　Calling on Women to Fight Drought and Overcome Famine
    [Our Dispatch] The Taihang Fifth Sub-district Women's Congress, which began on June 30th and lasted for ten days, successfully concluded on July 9th. On July 8th, the congress conducted evaluations and selected model workers, electing a total of thirteen model cadres from each county. The congress also awarded certificates and material prizes to encourage them. Due to numerous proposals and requests from all the cadres present, the sub-district Women's Federation was officially established on July 9th to strengthen women's work. Yang Yunyu, Ji Yu, Wu Ming, Fan Chengxi, and five others were elected as members of the sub-district Women's Federation, with Comrades Yang Yunyu and Ji Yu serving as chair and vice-chair, respectively. The congress made a special mobilization for fighting drought and overcoming famine, and each county formulated specific plans. For example, Cixian County, Huixian County, and Anyang County, among others, proposed during discussions: 1. Whether going to the countryside or returning to the office, resolutely refrain from preparing separate meals and share the joys and hardships with the masses, emulating the lives of the common people. 2. Conserve half or all of your winter clothing to hand over to the public. 3. Learn to do needlework yourself and avoid asking others to make clothes. At the closing of the congress, all women cadres were called upon to fully mobilize women to participate in the movement to fight drought and overcome famine, and to work together to rescue and protect seedlings. In areas where it has rained, women should be organized to launch the second hundred-day textile movement, and textile techniques should be improved. Every cadre present had sufficient confidence to organize women to overcome the disaster.
