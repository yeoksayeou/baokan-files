　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 19th: The Songjiang Provincial Committee convened a provincial mass work conference in late June to summarize the land reform work of the past six months. Over the past year, more than 800,000 poor peasants across the province have received a total of 1.17 million hectares of land. In the past six months, under the slogan of "Deepen Land Reform, Investigate Black Land, and Dig Out Bad Grain," only seven counties, including Bayan, have cleared out more than 40,000 stones of black grain, more than 10,000 heads of cattle and horses, and more than 100 million yuan in cash, all of which were distributed to poor people, solving many difficulties in their production. However, according to materials from the end of May, an average of one-half of the province is still in a "half-cooked" state, which needs to be vigorously promoted. Comrade Gao Gang, member of the Northeast Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China, pointed out at the meeting: The so-called mature areas must achieve the goal of letting go of mobilizing the masses, and thoroughly destroying feudal forces politically, economically, and militarily. At the same time, it is necessary to conduct struggles against "two-faced people," selfishness, and running dogs, to encourage upright people, reward meritorious officials, form new public opinion and work styles, and bring good cadres and good activists to the stage to closely integrate with the people. This is called the advantage of the basic masses. The so-called thoroughness of mass work refers to the above. To this end, Comrade Gao Gang proposed: Strive to solve the problem of "half-cooked" areas in the entire North Manchuria within this year. Regarding the work in areas that have matured, Comrade Gao Gang pointed out that one is production and the other is education, and the center of these two is supporting the front.

　　松江全省会议总结半年群运
    【新华社东北十九日电】松江省六月下旬召开全省群众工作会议，总结半年来土地改革工作。全省八十多万贫苦农民，一年来共分得土地一百一十七万垧。半年来在“深入土地改革查黑地挖坏粮”口号下，仅巴彦等七个县，即清出黑粮四万余石，牛马一万余头，现款一亿元以上，全部分给贫苦群众，解决了他们生产中许多困难。但根据五月底材料，全省平均尚有二分之一“夹生”地区，需待大力推动。中共东北中央局委员高岗同志在会议上指出：所谓熟了的地区就是要做到放手发动群众，从政治、经济，武装上彻底摧毁封建势力，与此同时必须进行反两面光、自私自利和狗腿子的斗争，要鼓励正派人、奖励功臣、形成新的舆论和作风、好干部和好积极分子上台和人民紧密结合，这就叫做基本群众的优势，群众工作所谓透了，就是指上述而言。至此高岗同志提出：争取全北满在今年以内，解决“夹生”地区的问题。对于已熟了的地区的工作，高岗同志指出一条是生产，一条是教育，而这二条的中心则是支援前线。
