【Report from this newspaper in Xiyang】 Xiyang's inspection of mutual aid revealed that the most serious problem currently is the excessively high wages for mutual aid, with everyone afraid of using too much labor. If this cannot be resolved, mutual aid will collapse. From the situation in Xiyu Village, there are the following problems: (1) Due to high wages, farmers with surplus labor are unwilling to organize for rush planting and expand agricultural operations, instead specializing in earning wages. In this village, ten work points equal five sheng of corn. If one mu of land requires ten work points, they earn one shi and five dou, more than they would harvest from planting their own land. (2) Equal value does not equal work: Debtor households cannot repay their labor, and the grain they receive is not enough to pay wages. (3) Loose planning, isolated attacks: After each rush task is completed, there is no work left. Therefore, those lacking labor naturally owe work, and even those who do not lack labor also owe work. Because rush tasks are time-limited, if there is no rush, labor can be adjusted and used more slowly, but it can still be done, and even if work is owed, it is not a problem. Precisely because of loose planning, everything is finished after a rush. Therefore, it is impossible to repay work, and there is even nothing for oneself to do. Based on this situation, the following solutions were discussed with the masses: (1) Appropriately reduce the equal value, from one fen and one and a half sheng to one fen and one jin. (2) Equal work, unequal value: Organize collective work repayment by groups. Debtor households are related to the group. Plan carefully, mobilize land reclamation, plant late crops, organize long-term labor households to earn work, and debtor households to repay work, opening up ideas through concrete lending. For example, Bai Cunxi, a long-term laborer in Xiyu Village, has 200 work points. Using this labor to reclaim wasteland and plant turnips can produce 70 dan per mu, equivalent to over a thousand jin. Reclaiming 20 mu can produce 20,000 jin. Even at current prices, this is better than planting on flat land. Organize debtors to repay work, and because tasks are frequent, all gaps can be used to repay work. If work is still owed, it can be postponed until the autumn grain harvest. This method satisfies everyone, whether they are long-term laborers or debtors.

【Report from this newspaper】 After Neiqiu Nanguan's mutual aid rushed planting, in order to further strengthen and expand the mutual aid group, after everyone's discussion, some immediately cleared their wages after the calculation, long-term laborers received wages, short-term laborers paid wages, individual households who really could not afford to give until the autumn, and after the accounts were settled in a timely manner, they began to rectify the mutual aid organization and fully launch a rush to hoe seedlings. From hoeing seedlings, everyone felt the benefits of mutual aid even more. Fan Shengxiang's group, with ten women and five men, hoed 17 mu of small seedlings in one day, evaluating labor and reviewing as they walked home. During hoeing, everyone was trying to be stronger and better, and no one wanted to fall behind. As Zhang Baobei said: "In the past, when I hoed in the field by myself, I didn't want to hoe after half a morning. Now that we have mutual aid, everyone hoes together, and we don't feel tired even until noon." Li Jie said: "When one person hoes in the field, it's hot, there's a lot of grass, and the field is long. Hoeing past it feels like drawing a line, and you get sleepy while hoeing. With mutual aid, a large area is started with one hand, which is really energetic. I don't feel tired all day, and everyone's spirits are very high."

【Report from this newspaper in Changzhi】 Nanquan Village in the Fifth District completed the second hoeing of seedlings by expanding mutual aid. There are 15 mutual aid groups in the village. During the seedling hoeing campaign, each group also applied additional fertilizer, watered indigo and hemp, and hoed seedlings. Everyone felt that they could not manage with the labor available. Also, due to drought and lack of rain, most people focused on watering indigo and abandoned hoeing seedlings, forgetting that hoes could also provide water. Some groups let things take their own course. After discovering this problem, labor hero Meng Shuze convened everyone for discussion. Pei Hanliu said: "My group has 140 mu of autumn land, 5 mu of indigo, and 8 mu of hemp. Because the group is small and there are few people, we took care of watering but not hoeing. We also couldn't find a way to push fertilizer; If we want to take care of it; we must expand mutual aid." Pei Jinhu said: "I have two wells by myself, I can't stir and scoop at the same time, I can't scoop and stir at the same time, I watered five ridges in one morning. If I had a child to scoop the ridges, I wouldn't have any difficulty." After discussion, it was determined that only expanding mutual aid and organizing auxiliary labor could solve the problem of not being able to manage everything. After everyone understood, they immediately combined freely and expanded the groups. Meng Shuze's group expanded by 29 people and elected him as the captain of the work exchange team. After expanding mutual aid, each group proposed a challenge to complete seedling hoeing in three days without delaying watering the garden. Under Meng Shuze's early and late efforts and active leadership, 300 mu of seedlings were hoeed in three days. The second hoeing has now been completed, and preparations are being made for the third hoeing, and plans are being made to engage in sideline production.

　　昔阳新区整顿互助经验
  　加强互助计划性合理组织工变工
    【本报昔阳讯】昔阳检查互助，发现当前最严重的问题为互助工资过高，人人害怕多用工，如不能解决，互助也将形成垮台。从西峪村的情况看，有以下的问题：（一）由于工资高，农户有剩余劳力亦不愿组织抢种，扩大农业经营，专门赚工资。该村是十分工斗五升玉茭，如果一亩地以十个工计算，即赚到一石五斗，比自己种地还收获多。（二）等价不等工，欠工户还不起工，收下粮食不够出工资。（三）计划松懈，孤立突击，每一个突击任务过去，即没营生啦，因此劳力缺乏的自然欠工，即劳力不缺乏的也欠了工。因为突击是有时间限制的，如果没突击，劳力调整使用虽然缓一些，但也能干的过来，即便欠了工也不怕。正由于计划松懈，一阵突击过去就完了，因此想还工也无法还，并且连自己也无事干。根据这种情况，和群众商量出以下解决办法：（一）适当降低等价，由一分一升半降至一分一斤。（二）等工不等价，组织按组集体还工，欠工户与组发生关系，计划严密，发动开荒，种晚庄稼，组织长工户得工，欠工户还工，以具体放帐打通思想。如西峪村长白存喜，长工二百个，用此工进行开生荒、种萝卜，每亩可产七十担，合千余斤，开二十亩，可产两万斤。就按现在也比种平地强，组织欠工者还工，因为任务经常，即可抽出一切空隙还工，如仍欠工可推到秋后算粮。这样办法不论长工欠工，人人都满意。　　　　　　　　（子由、新颖）
    【本报讯】内邱南关互助突击抢种后，为了进一步的加强与扩大互助组，经过大家讨论，工资算清后有的当即交清，长工支工资，短工出工资，个别户真给不起到秋后给，把帐及时清算后，就开始整顿互助组织，全力突击锄苗，从锄苗中大家更感到互助好处了，樊升香组十个妇女五个男子，一天锄草田小苗十七亩，往家一面走一面评议劳力一面检讨，在锄苗中都是你强我胜的锄，谁也不愿落后，如张宝贝说：“过去我自己在地里锄地，一到半前晌就不愿锄了，现在互助起来，大家在一块锄，锄到大晌午也不疲乏。”李杰说：“一个人在地里锄，天又热，草又多，地身又长，锄过去好象划了一道一样，锄着锄着就瞌睡了，互助起来，有一块地下手就是一大片，看着真有劲。整天就是不觉着累，大家的情绪都很高。

    【本报长治讯】五区南泉村扩大互助完成第二遍锄苗，该村共有互助组十五个，在锄苗运动中，各组又上追粪，又浇靛浇麻，又锄苗，都感觉劳力上顾不住，又因天旱雨缺，一般的都是集中浇靛，放弃锄苗，忘记了锄头有水，有的组则任其自流。发现这个问题后，劳动英雄孟树则就召集大家讨论。裴憨刘说：“我组秋地一百四十亩，靛五亩，麻八亩，因组小人少，顾了浇顾不了锄，想推粪也没法；想要顾住；非扩大互助不行。”裴金虎说：“我一人有两眼井，搅了拨不了，拨了搅不了，一晌午浇了五畦。要是有个小孩拨畦，咱也可不困难。”经讨论只有扩大互助，组织辅助劳力，才能解决这个顾不住的困难。大家明确后，随即自由结合，把组扩大。孟树则组，就扩大了二十九人，选他为变工队大队长。经扩大互助后，各组提出挑战，三天完成锄苗，不误浇园，在孟树则的起早搭黑，积极领导下，三天锄苗三百亩，现已完成二遍，准备锄三遍，并计划搞副业生产。
