Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, July 17th: The Chiang bandits are intensifying their destruction of riverbanks. In addition to continuing to frantically bomb riverbanks during the day, American-made Chiang planes are also taking turns dropping flares to indiscriminately bomb the hundreds of miles of riverbanks along the Juan (Cheng) and Yun (Cheng) line at night. This has greatly hindered our work, which we were forced to do at night, to repair the river. Residents along the river and dike workers have suffered casualties. In Shouzhang County's Zhao Village area alone, ten peasants were killed or injured on July 1st. In Zhangtang Village, Zhangqiu County, a house was destroyed and two people were killed or injured. People here believe that Chiang's actions are a signal that after Chen Cheng's "Memorandum on Withdrawing UNRRA Personnel from both sides of the Yellow River" was issued, he would stop at nothing and plot to create a huge disaster to flood seven million people along the river.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, July 17th: More than ten counties in the Bohai area along the Yellow River are mobilizing to defend against major floods. In addition to more than 50,000 young and middle-aged people urgently repairing the dikes, about 100,000 men, women, and semi-able-bodied laborers are participating in the repair and transportation of materials. The entire Independent Regiment of Huimin County is participating in the emergency repairs. The Wangjiazhuang dangerous section in Lijin County suffered a collapse of the dam due to the rushing water. Eight thousand civilians in the county have been repairing it in the rain for days, expanding it into a large dam 150 meters wide and 1,700 meters long in addition to patching the breach. Civilians from Zhanhua and Huimin traveled more than 200 miles to assist. Most of the bricks and stones needed for this flood control were enthusiastically donated by the masses. Han Guiying, chairman of the Women's Rescue Association in Maihuo Village, Lijin County, donated 20,000 bricks. However, just as the people were fully engaged in flood control, they were subjected to continuous destruction by the Chiang puppets. On the 7th of this month, three American-made Chiang planes flew over the Wangpanzhen and Liuwangzhuang dikes and strafed them in turns, killing one woman. The dike repair workers were greatly frightened, which affected the progress of the project.

    蒋机狂炸河堤
    阴谋制造巨灾
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十七日电】蒋贼破坏河堤益急。美制蒋机除白天继续狂炸河堤外，更在夜间轮番投掷照明弹滥炸我鄄（城）郓（城）一线数百里河堤，致我被迫改在夜间抢修之工程，已遭受极大阻碍，沿河居民及堤工蒙受伤亡，仅七月一日一天内，寿张县赵庄一带，被炸死炸伤农民十人，张秋县张堂村被炸毁房子一所、死伤二人。此间人士认为，蒋贼此举显系陈诚“撤退黄河两岸联总人员备忘录”发表后，即不顾一切，阴谋制造巨灾，淹没沿河七百万人民的一个信号。
    【新华社山东十七日电】渤海区沿黄河十余县军民，刻正总动员防御大汛。除五万余壮年紧急修险外，参加修黄运输之男女及半劳动力，约在十万以上。惠民县独立团全部参加抢险。利津县王家庄险工因水势激冲，堤坝塌毁。全县八千民夫连日冒雨抢修，除培补缺口外，并将其增修为宽一百五十米、长一千七百米之大坝。沾化、惠民民夫跋涉二百余里，赶往协助。此次防汛所需砖石，大部为群众踊跃捐输。利津县买货村妇救会长韩桂英即献砖两万块。然正当人民全力防汛之际，复遭蒋伪不断破坏。本月七日即有美造蒋机三架飞临王判镇、刘王庄大堤上空轮番扫射，击毙妇女一人，修堤民夫饱受惊吓，影响工程之进行。
