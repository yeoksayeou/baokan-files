Recently, rainfall has been gradually increasing in various regions, and as the autumn seedlings begin to grow, pests have started to damage them. According to the information received, mole crickets are causing widespread and serious damage in southern Hebei. At the same time, locusts have infested eight counties, seriously threatening the autumn harvest. In the Taihang region, some areas have also experienced locust nymphs, and more than ten counties have been affected by mole crickets, walnut borers, and other pests, causing significant damage to autumn seedlings.

We must urgently engage in the struggle against insect pests to protect autumn seedlings, regarding it as equally important as overcoming drought. We must promote the experience of fighting locusts in 1944, capturing and killing them early to resolutely eliminate locusts in the nymph stage. If they develop into flying locusts, it will not only cause significant losses to ourselves but also harm neighboring areas. In areas where locusts have been eliminated, repeated inspections should be conducted to avoid any escapees. In areas where locusts are currently being captured and killed, we must resolutely and thoroughly eliminate them without any relaxation, embodying the stubborn spirit of the struggle against landlords. In areas that have previously experienced locust plagues but have not yet discovered any, we must constantly investigate the situation, and once discovered, immediately capture and kill them with all our strength.

The broad masses of women, children, and auxiliary laborers have already made great contributions in spring plowing, sowing, drought resistance, and famine preparedness. They should take more responsibility in the struggle against locusts and insect pests, becoming the main force for a long-term and sustained effort to eradicate locusts and eliminate pests.

In short, we hope that everyone will raise their vigilance, organize themselves, and launch a movement to eliminate pests and protect seedlings, in order to increase food production and support the victory of the great counter-offensive.

    扑灭害虫保护秋苗
    近来各地逐渐落雨，秋苗刚要生长，害虫又相继害苗，据已得情况，冀南蝼蛄为灾相当普遍和严重，同时也有八个县发生蝗虫，严重威胁着秋季收成。太行也有些地方发生蝗蝻，十余县发生蝼蛄核桃虫等灾害，秋苗被毁甚多。急起与虫灾作斗争保护秋苗，应该看作和克服旱灾同等重要，发扬四四年打蝗经验，及早捕打，把蝗虫坚决消灭在蝗蝻阶段，如发展成为飞蝗，则不仅自己损失大，并为害邻区。在已消灭地区要反复检查，免致漏网。正在捕打地区要毫不放松的坚决彻底消灭之，发扬斗争地主的顽固精神。已往闹过蝗灾现在尚未发现的地区，要经常调查情况，一旦发现即全力捕打。广大的妇女儿童副劳动力，春耕下种抗旱备荒中已立了大功，对蝗灾虫灾作斗争要更多负责，成为剿蝗灭虫长期坚持的主力军。总之，希望大家提高警惕，组织起来，开展扑灭害虫保苗运动，以增产食粮支援大反攻的胜利。
