[This dispatch comes from] Taiyue, 26th of this month: Zhang Jiuge's mutual aid brigade in Zhangma Village, Qinshui County, has created a wealth of leadership experience in leading production, preventing drought, saving resources, and preparing for famine. First, in organizing leadership, the most important thing is to take poor tenant farmers as the backbone. Brigade leader Zhang Jiuge, deputy brigade leader Zhang Jianfu, and instructor An Changjiang are all poor peasants. Among the five joint team leaders, two are extremely poor peasants and three are poor peasants. Among the thirty-five labor mutual aid group leaders, there is one tenant farmer, nineteen poor peasants, and fifteen middle peasants. In total, tenant farmers and poor peasants account for more than 65 percent of the entire brigade's leadership. Therefore, they were able to organize 247 of the 260 households in the village into the labor mutual aid brigade. Secondly, they unite well. After the first joint team finished cultivating, they immediately organized manpower and livestock to rush planting for the third joint team. In addition, the brigade has certain disciplines and systems to ensure that the absorption of team members must be discussed by the group, and work points must be scored democratically. In particular, it is necessary to solicit the opinions of the person concerned before assigning work. Whether it is sowing or weeding, every ten days is a season, and each group must hold a meeting to review and arrange work. Those who cannot work due to illness or other reasons must ask for leave to prevent self-flow. More praise and less criticism, public praise, individual criticism, and the blackboard newspaper erected at the entrance of the village office regularly praise various model deeds. Second, pay attention to ideological leadership; the masses are most afraid of holding too many meetings, so they often adopt the method of chatting at group meetings. When calling for savings, they ask men to persuade women ideologically, pay attention to saving on cooking, and have made great achievements. According to the current saving of seven taels of millet per person per day, the whole village can save 6,000 catties of millet in twenty days. Third, technical leadership, advocating early planting, half a month earlier than in previous years. Before planting, they called for harrowing three times to retain moisture. As a result, the autumn seedlings in the whole village are full. Only the five households in Shang Jixi group have insufficient seedlings on four and a half mu of land, which was caused by the group leader's lack of attention. At present, the whole village has 1,298 mu of millet, which has been weeded twice, and 1,400 mu of corn, which can be weeded for the second time in another sixteen days. The millet has grown two feet high, and the corn has grown four feet high.

　　贫雇作领导骨干
  　张九铬互助队越干越巩固
    【本报太岳二十六日电】沁水张马村张九铬互助大队，在领导生产防旱节约备荒上，创造了丰富的领导经验。第一组织领导，最重要的是以贫佃农为骨干，大队长张九铬、副大队长张建富、指导员安长江都是贫农；五个联合组长中，有两个赤贫农三个贫农；三十五个劳动互助小组长中，有一个佃农、十九个贫农、十五个中农。总计佃、贫农占全大队领导成份的百分之六十五强。因此首先能把全村二百六十户中的二百四十七户，组织到劳动互助大队中来。其次是团结好，当第一联合组耕种完毕后，立即组织人力牲口，为第三联合组抢种。此外，大队内有一定的纪律和制度，保证吸收组员必须经过小组讨论，记工要经过民主评分，特别是给谁做要首先征求本人的意见。不论下种锄苗，每十天是个季头，各组要开一次会，检讨布置工作。因事因病不能劳动，要请假，以防自流。多表扬，少批评，当众表扬，个别批评，竖在村公所门口的黑板报，经常表扬各种模范事迹。第二注意思想领导；群众最怕多开会，因此经常采取小组会上漫谈方法，在号召节约时，叫男人去打通妇女思想，注意了锅头上节约，做出很大成绩，按现在每人每天以节约七两小米，二十天中全村可节约小米六千斤。第三技术领导，提倡早种，比往年提前半个月，种前又号召耙三次养湿，结果全村秋苗都满苗，只有尚积喜组五家有四亩半地苗不足，是因组长领导未注意造成，现全村一千二百九十八亩谷子，已锄过两次，一千四百亩玉茭，再有十六天，第二遍可以锄毕。谷子已长二尺高，玉茭长到四尺高了。
