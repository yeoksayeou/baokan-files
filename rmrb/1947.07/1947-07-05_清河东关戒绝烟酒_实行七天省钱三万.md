　　【Jinan, Hebei, 3rd dispatch from this newspaper】Cadres set an example, using accounting methods to get the masses to think, Qinghe Dongguan made a covenant to abstain from tobacco and alcohol, save money for famine relief. After a seven-day experiment, the whole village saved 30,000 yuan. Tang Ligui, director of the village armed forces committee, stated to the masses at the meeting: "Originally, I liked to eat and drink, and smoke cigarettes. Just smoking cigarettes cost me six or seven hundred yuan a day, more than 20,000 yuan a month. Drinking a little wine and eating something good cost me more than 20,000 yuan a month. Now, red sorghum costs 1,000 yuan per斗 (dǒu, a unit of dry measure), and a month's waste is 300 jin of red sorghum. According to each person eating two jin a day, that's enough for one person for five months. This amount is shocking! From now on, I am determined to correct this. Starting tomorrow, if anyone sees me smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol again, the masses can criticize me at the general meeting, without hesitation! From tomorrow, I will no longer eat good food, and I guarantee to work in the fields for two shifts a day." Under his influence, some people said, "If we really quit completely, we can save a lot." After much discussion, the masses expressed their attitudes at the meeting based on their own shortcomings. More than 30 people who often smoked paper cigarettes all stated that they would stop smoking and drinking from tomorrow, and they all made their own rules. Finally, a covenant was formulated for the whole village to abstain from tobacco and alcohol. At that time, some people asked: What if we encounter happy or sad events? Some people said: "Happy and sad events should also be completely prohibited. Now that we have all turned ourselves around, these bad old rules should be changed." After discussion, tobacco and alcohol are not used for happy or sad events, and paper is not burned for sad events. It has now been implemented for seven days, and the whole village has truly achieved no one smoking paper cigarettes or drinking alcohol. In just seven days, the tobacco and alcohol item alone saved more than 30,000 yuan.

　　清河东关戒绝烟酒  实行七天省钱三万
    【本报冀南三日电】干部作模范，用算帐方式，打通群众思想，清河东关公约戒绝烟酒，节约备荒，七天实验结果，全村节约三万元。村武委会主任唐立贵在大会上向群众表明：“原先我好吃吃喝喝、吸烟卷，光吸烟卷一天就得六、七百元，每月得两万余元，喝点酒吃点好的每月又得两万多，现在红粮一千元一斗，一个月的浪费就得红粮三百斤，按每人每天吃用二斤就够一个人五个月食用，这个数目是如何惊人呀！今后我决心纠正，明天起谁再见了我吸烟卷喝酒，群众大会批评我，决不含糊！从明天不再吃好的，保证一天两晌到地里干活”。在他影响下，有的说：“要真全戒了可省多啦”。经纷纷酝酿后，群众在大会上都针对自己的毛病表示了态度，经常吸纸烟的三十多人，都表明从明天起停止吸烟喝酒，并都自订了纪律，最后制订成全村断绝烟酒公约，当时有人提出：如遇红白大事怎么办？有的群众说：“过红白大事也该完全禁止，现在咱都翻身了，这些不好的旧规矩应该换换样”。讨论结果，红白事不用烟酒，白事不用烧纸，现已实行七天，全村真正做到没一个吸纸烟喝酒的。仅七天的烟酒一项就节省三万多元。
