　　Snippets from the Education Sector in the Chiang Kai-shek Controlled Areas

    ★Last month, the Yunlong County Government sent officials to Yongfeng Township to collect overdue taxes from previous years. Farmers Zhao Xiangtian and Li Wanxin, unable to pay, were arrested and escorted to the county seat. They were denied food and drink along the way, and subjected to shackles and handcuffs, as well as whipping and beating. After only one day of travel, Zhao Xiangtian was brutally beaten to death. The fate of Li Wanxin remains unknown.
    ★Nie Shusen, a Xiang native who was laid off as a hired worker and unable to find a way to make a living, went to Xiba to commit suicide by drowning. He was rescued, but upon returning home, he ingested seven qian of opium in another suicide attempt. He was again rescued and survived. On May 30th, he made a third attempt by cutting his abdomen with a leather knife, finally resulting in his death.
    ★Amid skyrocketing prices, strange occurrences are multiplying. On May 31st, at noon, a man named Baozhu stormed into the manager's office of the Jikang Bank on Nanping Street, brandishing a machete. He said to the manager, "I have no food to eat. Please lend me 500,000 yuan to help me out of this emergency. 500,000 yuan is nothing to you. Any more and you might accuse me of robbing the bank." The manager pretended to agree and went outside to call two employees to tie Baozhu up.
    ★Newspapers have been reporting daily on shootings in the city and suburbs, such as "female bandits" robbing people on Tengchong Road, a robbery on Tuodong Road No. 16 during a heavy rain, and six merchant vehicles robbed in the suburbs in a single day. These incidents are too numerous to count. The Chiang Kai-shek's Yunnan Provincial Government is alarmed and has ordered the city government to conduct a "census" starting from the 4th. (Sent from Kunming on June 4th)

　　蒋区教育界零讯
    ★云龙县府上月派吏至永丰乡催收历年欠赋，将交不出粮之农民赵湘田、李万馨拘押解县，沿途不予饮食，且加脚镣手铐，一路鞭挞棍打，只行一日，即将赵湘田惨打致死，李万馨迄今生死不明。
    ★被解雇佣工湘人聂树森，以无法谋生，于日前往西坝投河自杀，被人救起，返家复吞鸦片七钱自杀，亦经救治，幸未丧生，五月三十日又以皮刀一把第三次切腹自杀，终告毙命。
    ★物价暴涨声中，怪事叠出。有一名保柱者，于五月三十一日中午，手持马刀一把，冲入南屏街济康银行经理室，向该经理云：“没有饭吃了，请借五十万元救急。五十万元在你算不了什么回事，要多又恐怕说我抢银行”。该经理佯装答应，出室唤二行员将保柱给捆住。
    ★连日报载市区及郊外枪案，如腾冲路“女匪”抢人，拓东路十六号大雨中被抢，市郊一日被劫商车六辆等，多至不可胜记，蒋记滇省府亦为之惶恐，命令市府自四日起“清查户口”。（六月四日寄自昆明）
