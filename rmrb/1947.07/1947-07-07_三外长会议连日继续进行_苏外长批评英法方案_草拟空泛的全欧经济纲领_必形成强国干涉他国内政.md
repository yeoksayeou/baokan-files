Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. Comprehensive report: The Paris Three Foreign Ministers' Meeting was held on the afternoon of the 1st, lasting one and a half hours. The meeting continued on the 2nd. At the meeting on the 30th of last month, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union each put forward their own plans. The British and French plans were roughly the same. The fundamental difference between them and the Soviet plan lies in the fact that the British and French plans do not focus on considering the possibility and extent of obtaining American assistance based on the needs of European countries, but on establishing a vague and all-encompassing European recovery plan, so that the economies of European countries are subject to the control of the United States, Britain, and France. The Soviet plan resolutely opposes this conspiracy, focusing on obtaining American assistance according to the needs of each country. Molotov criticized the British and French plans in his proposal to the Three Foreign Ministers' Meeting on the 30th, saying: "Because drafting such a pan-European economic program, even if some other countries participate, will inevitably strengthen the will of European powers over other European countries and form interference in the internal affairs of various countries and violation of their sovereignty"; "This will lead to the breakdown of existing economic relations between European countries and serious friction, hindering the further development of economic cooperation that is extremely needed by European countries at present."

Main Points of the Soviet Plan
The main points of the Soviet plan are as follows: (1) The Three Foreign Ministers' Meeting must consider it appropriate to establish an assistance committee composed of representatives from the Soviet Union, Britain, and France, and later joined by representatives from some other European countries. The purpose of this committee is to determine the needs of European countries for American economic assistance and to determine the possibility of the United States providing such assistance and helping European countries obtain such assistance. (2) Under the assistance committee, establish various sub-committees for food, fuel, equipment, etc. In addition to the representatives of the Soviet Union, Britain, and France, these should include two countries that suffered German occupation and helped the Allies fight together, and that have particular vested interests in the work of a certain sub-committee. As for the former enemy countries, they may be invited by the sub-committee for consultation. (3) The specific tasks of the assistance committee should be: (A) Accept the estimates of European countries for the need for American assistance. (B) Draft an assistance plan based on these estimates; the needs of those countries that have been invaded by Germany and have contributed to the victory of the Allies should be considered first. (C) Determine the possibility of American assistance being approved in the US Congress. (D) The assistance committee should establish relations with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe in accordance with its duties.

The core of the British plan is to immediately establish a steering committee to "coordinate" the economic recovery plans of European countries in the next four years. This plan is to be reviewed by European countries and submitted to the United States. The French plan is largely the same as the British plan. TASS commented on the British and French proposals, saying: "Obviously, Britain and France do not object to compromising with the United States in order to establish control over other European countries, and attempt to use so-called steering committees, etc., to make those countries' economies suitable for their own requirements and wishes, as well as the requirements put forward by the United States in this regard."

Points of Divergence Between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. Comprehensive report: The Three Foreign Ministers' Meeting held in Paris by the Soviet Union, Britain, and France has been held three times from the 27th to the 30th of last month, excluding the rest day on the 29th. At the meetings on the 27th and 28th, differences of opinion have emerged among the three countries on certain issues, and consultations are still underway. First of all, there is the issue of preconditions for the meeting. The Soviet side advocates that the US government should first be asked about the true situation of the Marshall Plan, the nature, conditions, and amount of loans to assist European countries, and whether the US government and Congress agree to and approve it. Britain and France did not attach importance to this issue, but advocated that an "economic recovery plan" for Europe should be formulated as soon as possible. Britain hopes to complete the plan before August. Secondly, there is the issue of the tasks of the meeting. At the meeting, Britain, with the support of France, put forward a plan including the formulation of an all-encompassing economic program for European countries, requesting its adoption, which only casually mentioned the need for American assistance. The Soviet Union expressed doubts about this, believing that France's vague plan would interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. The Soviet Union and the new democratic countries of Europe have long implemented their own correct plans and have achieved results, and there is no need to be bound by a vague plan to restrict their economic development. If the meeting is forced to formulate and accept such a vague plan, it will not only meet with failure, but will only damage the international prestige of Britain, France, and other countries. The Soviet Union believes that the current task of the meeting is to accept appropriate estimates from the countries concerned to review and determine the extent to which European countries need American economic assistance. Regarding the method of studying issues at the current meeting, such as determining the extent to which European countries need American economic assistance, the Soviet Union believes that an appropriate committee can be established for research, composed of representatives from the Soviet Union, Britain, and France, and inviting other European countries, especially those that suffered German occupation and made efforts to support the Allies in defeating the enemy, and these countries should first receive American economic assistance according to their needs. France suggested that the neutral countries and former enemy countries (including Germany) in Europe should all participate in the European economic recovery plan, with the exception of Spain. The Soviet Union believes that the former enemy countries can participate in a consultative capacity, and the German question should not be included in the discussion. As for the relationship between this committee and the United Nations, the Soviet Union believes that it should establish relations with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, while Britain and France advocate independence from United Nations institutions.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. Various sources: While the Soviet, British, and French Foreign Ministers were holding the Paris meeting, French President Auriol hosted a banquet for the Soviet and British delegations on the 28th of last month, and the US ambassador to France was also invited to attend. French Prime Minister Ramadier and many senior French officials attended. On the morning of the 30th, Marshall discussed the progress of the Paris Foreign Ministers' Meeting in detail with the British Ambassador to the United States, Inverchapel, in Washington for about 40 minutes. Inverchapel declared that he would return to London on July 2, and may stay for several weeks for consultations.

　　三外长会议连日继续进行
  　苏外长批评英法方案
    草拟空泛的全欧经济纲领　必形成强国干涉他国内政
    【新华社陕北三日电】综合报导：巴黎三外长会议，一日下午举行会议，历时一小时半，二日仍将继续开会。在上月卅日会议中，苏、英、法均提出了各自方案，英、法方案大抵相同，其与苏联方案的基本分歧点在于：英、法之方案，重点不在于就欧洲国家之需要而考虑获得美国援助之可能性及程度，而在于建立一个空泛的无所不包的欧洲复兴计划，以便欧洲国家的经济受制于美英法。苏联的方案坚决反对此种阴谋，重点在于按各国之需要以取得美国之援助。莫洛托夫三十日在对三外长会议的建议中对英、法方案批评称：“因为草拟此种全欧经济纲领即使有某些其他国家参加，也必然会造成欧洲强国的意志加强在欧洲其他国家之上，并且形成对各国内政的干涉及违犯他们的主权”；“这会引致欧洲各国间现存经济关系的破裂与严重摩擦，阻碍了目前欧洲各国极其需要的经济合作之进一步发展。”
    苏联方案要点
    苏联方案之要点如下：（一）三外长会议须认为应当建立一个援助委员会，由苏、英、法三国代表组成，日后再由一些欧洲其他国家之代表参加。这个委员会的目的在于确知欧洲各国对美国经济援助之需要，确知美国给与此种援助及帮助欧洲各国获取此种援助的可能性。（二）在援助委员会之下建立粮食、燃料、装备等各小组委员会，其中除苏、英、法三国代表外，应包括两个遭受德国占领和帮助盟国共同作战，而又与某一个小组委员会的工作中别有利害关系的国家。至于前敌国则可由小组委员会邀请以备咨询。（三）援助委员会的具体任务应是：（甲）接受欧洲各国对美国援助所需要的估计。（乙）根据这些估计草拟一个援助计划；那些曾受德国侵略又对盟国胜利有贡献的国家的需要，应首先被审议。（丙）确知美国援助在美国会中批准的可能性。（丁）援助委员会遵照联合国欧洲经济委员会之职责与其建立关系。
    英国方案之中心，为立即建立一个指导委员以颇具“协调”今后四年内欧洲各国经济复兴之计划。这个计划由欧洲各国加以审查，并提交美国。法国计划与英大同小异。塔斯社对英、法此种提议评称：“显然地英、法不反对与美国妥协，以便建立对欧洲其他国家的控制，并企图通过所谓指导委员会等，以使那些国家的经济适合于他们自己的要求和愿望，以及美国在这方面所提出的要求。”
    英法与苏的分歧点
    【新华社陕北二日电】综合报导：苏、英、法在巴黎举行的三国外长会议，自上月二十七日至三十日，除二十九日休息外，已举行三次。在二十七、廿八两日之会议中，若干问题上三国已显露出意见的分歧，刻仍在磋商中。首先是会议进行的先决条件问题，苏联方面主张应先询问美国政府关于马歇尔计划之真实情形，援助欧洲国家贷款之性质、条件与数目如何及美政府与国会是否同意与允准等。英、法则未重视此一问题，而主张早日拟定欧洲“经济复兴计划”，英国希望在八月以前完成该计划。其次是会议的任务问题，在会议中，由英国赞同法国提出了一个计划，包括欧洲各国拟定一个无所不包的经济纲领，要求通过，其中仅仅随便提到对美国援助之需要；苏联对此表示怀疑，认为法国那样空泛的计划，将会干涉其他国家的内政。苏联与欧洲新民主国家早就实行了自己正确的计划，而且获有成绩，用不着再在一个空泛的计划下来束缚自己经济的发展。如果强迫会议来制定与接受这种空泛的计划，不仅要碰到失败，而且只有损害英、法等国在国际上的威信。苏联认为会议当前任务是接受有关国家的适当估计，以审查并确定欧洲各国需要美国经济援助之程度。苏联在关于目前会议研究问题的方法，如确定欧洲各国需要美国经济援助之程度等，苏联认为可以建立一个适当的委员会来研究，由苏、英、法三国代表组成，并邀请其他欧洲国家，首先是那些遭受德国占领并尽力支持盟国共同击败敌人的国家参加，而且这些国家应当按其需要首先得到美国经济的援助。法国则建议欧洲的中立国及前敌国（包括德国）均要参加欧洲经济复兴计划，只有西班牙除外。苏认为前敌国可以咨询资格参加，德国问题则不应包括在讨论之列。至于这个委员会与联合国的关系，苏联认为应与联合国欧洲经济委员会建立关系，英、法则主张独立于联合国机构之外。
    【新华社陕北二日电】各方消息：当苏、英、法三外长进行巴黎会议之际，上月二十八日法总统阿里奥宴请苏、英两国代表团，美注法大使亦被邀参加。法总理拉玛第及法高级官员多人出席。三十日晨马歇尔在华盛顿与英驻美大使殷维却波尔详细讨论巴黎外长会议之进展约四十分钟。殷氏宣称：将于七月二日返伦敦，或将逗留数周有所磋商。
