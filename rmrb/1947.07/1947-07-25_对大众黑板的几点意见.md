A few opinions on mass blackboards
    Mao Maochun Zhao Dexin
    Recently, I have traveled to the countryside a few times and have seen many blackboard newspapers. This shows that the village cadres are paying attention to cultural propaganda, but they are not paying enough attention. For example, one village's blackboard newspaper contained General Liu Bocheng's anniversary congratulatory message to the People's Daily. Another village's blackboard newspaper had not been changed for one or two weeks. Some villages copied Xinhua News Agency editorials and news from newspapers onto the blackboard newspaper verbatim. Some mass blackboards are full of advertisements and flyers. At the same time, there are also many villages that have never seen blackboard newspapers at all.
    The mass blackboard newspaper is a very good propaganda tool, and should be promoted, utilized, and mastered well, so as to promote the work of the village and at the same time carry out universal current affairs education. Here, I put forward a few suggestions to discuss with the villages.
    (1) Clarify the purpose: We believe that the village's blackboard newspaper should be a tool to guide and promote the work of the village. It should serve the central work. Its target audience should be the masses in the village. If you don't understand this purpose, the blackboard newspaper will not be well run.
    Therefore, we believe that the content of the blackboard newspaper should first of all publish more about the work and movements in the village. Such as drought prevention and famine preparedness models; production mutual assistance heroes; active supporters of the front lines; and typical examples in various work, (good and bad) are all good content. The more closely the material is linked to the actual life of the masses, the more the masses will like to read it.
    In addition to publishing materials from this village, it is also possible and should publish news from districts, counties, and at home and abroad (mainly domestic). Recently, good news of the great counter-offensive has been frequently spread. The blackboard newspaper should regularly publish comprehensive military reports (weekly results, monthly battle conditions, etc.). In this way, the masses can have a more systematic understanding of the situation. If you say piecemeal that ×× city was liberated today and ×× town was recovered tomorrow, it is easy to make the masses unable to grasp the key points and see the overall situation clearly.
    (2) Form: In terms of length, we think it should be short and concise, simple and clear. Because in general, the cultural level of the masses is low, and they cannot accept the verbatim copy of an editorial and news. It should be turned into words and sentences that the masses can easily understand. In terms of form, more popular forms such as clapper talk, drum lyrics, and ditties should be published. The font should be written clearly and beautifully, and no cursive writing should be used.
    Also, the blackboard newspaper should be changed frequently. If it is not changed for a long time, the masses will feel bored. The effect will not be great. We think it should be changed once every five or six days at most. In places with market days, it can be changed every market day.
    (3) Special person in charge of running the newspaper: The comrades in charge of running the newspaper (elementary school teachers, or civil education committee members, etc.) should go deep into the masses and discover typical materials. It is best to mobilize everyone to run the newspaper, everyone to write articles, everyone to speak, write about their own affairs, write for themselves, so that the blackboard newspaper can truly become the locomotive to promote the work in the village.

　　对大众黑板的几点意见
    毛茂春　赵德新
    最近在乡间走了几趟，看见不少黑板报，这表明村干们是注意了文化宣传工作，但是却注意得不够。比如：有一个村的黑板报上，写的是刘伯承将军给人民日报的周年祝词。另一个村的黑板报，一两礼拜没有更换。有些村把新华社的社论和报纸上的新闻，原封不动的搬到黑板报上。还有些大众黑板上，尽贴的是广告传单。同时也有不少村庄，就根本没有见到过黑板报。
    大众黑板报是一种很好的宣传工具，应当好好提倡、利用和掌握，使对村的工作起推动作用，同时普遍进行时事教育。在这里，我提出几点意见，来和各村研讨。
    （一）明确目的：村里的黑板报，我们觉得应当是指导与推动村里工作的工具。它应当为中心工作服务。它的对象应当是村中群众。弄不明白这个目的，黑板报是办不好的。
    因此，黑板报的内容，我们觉得首先就当多登出村中的工作和运动。如防旱备荒的模范；生产互助的英雄；支援前线的积极分子；和各种工作当中的典型事例，（好、坏）都是好内容。材料越和群众的实际生活连系的紧，群众就越爱看。
    除了登本村的材料以外，还可以而且应当登出区、县以及国内外的新闻（主要是国内）。近来大反攻的捷音频传，黑板报上应当经常登出综合性的军事报导（一周战绩，一月战况等）。这样，能使群众比较系统的了解一下形势。若零零碎碎的说今天解放××城，明天收复××镇，容易把群众弄的抓不住重点，看不清全面局势。
    （二）形式：从篇幅上说，我们觉得应该短小精干，简单明了。因为一般说，群众的文化程度是低的，原封的抄个社论和新闻，他们接受不了。应该把它变成群众容易听懂的字句。从形式上说，应当多登出快板、鼓词、小调等群众最喜爱的形式。字体要写得清楚好看，不写草字。
    还有黑板报应该常换，老不换，群众就感到没味。起的作用也不会大。我们觉得最多五、六天应当换一次。有集市的地方，可以每逢集日换一下。
    （三）专人负责大家办报：负责办报的同志（小学教员，或民教委员等）应当深入群众，多发现典型材料。最好能发动大家办报，大家写稿，大家说稿，写自己的事，写给自己看，使黑板报真正成为开展推动村上工作的火车头。
