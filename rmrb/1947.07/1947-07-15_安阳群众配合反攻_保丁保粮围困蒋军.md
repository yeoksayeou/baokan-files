[This report from our office in Anyang] The masses around Anyang city thoroughly understand that the Chiang troops are bound to be defeated, and are launching a mass movement to starve the Chiang troops to death. After our main force transferred, the enemy in the city frantically sent troops to seize grain and capture manpower. In Sanfen Village, with less than one hundred households, they forcibly demanded six thousand catties of wheat and eighty catties of pancakes in one instance. Therefore, protecting grain, manpower, and livestock has become the urgent demand of the masses. The armed militia company in our Seventh and Eighth Districts resolutely protects the interests of the masses. Since the 12th of last month, on the one hand, they have continuously taken the initiative to attack, using sniper fire and explosions to strike at enemy activities and boost the morale of the masses; on the other hand, they have widely carried out propaganda for the great counter-offensive. They told the people around the city: "The great counter-offensive is coming. We are about to win. Sons and grain are our lives. We must not let the Chiang troops steal them." The masses liked to hear these words. When the enemy came, young people either reported the news or moved with the militia, actively cooperating in the battle and taking the initiative to monitor the enemy. Because the masses had the support of the militia, they became bolder. When the enemy troops harassed ×× Village, wanting to eat pancakes, the masses deliberately delayed the time. Before the enemy could eat, the militia arrived after receiving intelligence, infuriating the enemy, who had no choice but to retreat. After retreating, they counter-attacked, but the militia had only six people. The masses helped the militia fight. When the militia's gun barrels got hot, the masses quickly oiled them. When the militia was tired, the masses monitored the enemy and let them rest before fighting again. Finally, they drove the enemy away. The masses were very happy and fried eggs for the militia to eat. Another time, when the enemy went to ×× Village to seize grain, two women fought with the enemy to prevent them from stealing. They beat the village chief and the people surrounded the enemy, not letting them leave, wanting to go to the city to file a lawsuit. The masses of × Village openly said to the Chiang troops: "The Eighth Route Army is good! The Eighth Route Army pays money even if they break the people's bowls." The enemy also had no choice. These methods of soft resistance and hard confrontation by the masses often created good opportunities for the militia to annihilate the enemy. Many villages adopted this method of cooperation and repelled the enemy's grain seizure. The militia then seized such examples to educate the masses, and the masses' determination and enthusiasm became even greater. With the cooperation of the masses, the militia's activities became very active. Wherever there was an enemy, they went there, and they became more and more familiar with the enemy's situation. In terms of combat methods, they also changed the past "bull-butting" tactics and adopted flanking maneuvers, making the enemy uneasy and reducing the losses of the masses. In carrying out the explosion movement, they were even more closely integrated with the masses. The masses stood guard and scouted enemy situations, and the militia combined with the masses to jointly lay mines. This ensured that the mines did not miss their target. In ten days of fighting, three landmines killed twelve enemies. Now, the villages around Anyang City, five or six miles away from the enemy, have completely established revolutionary democratic order. The masses have prepared empty rooms to hide grain. When the enemy comes, the masses run away (especially young people). The masses isolate the enemy, and the enemy is everywhere in a passive position, afraid to act. Recently, the militia's activities have extended to the Pinghan Railway.

[This report from our office in Yuanshi] On June 23rd, more than one hundred Chiang puppet troops stationed in the Zhangye Village area of Yuanshi went to Xizheng Village to seize wheat. When they approached Xu, north of the village, the village chief was plowing in the fields north of the village. When he discovered the enemy situation, he took out a box from his waist and fired a shot. The militia captain, Zhang Qunchang, heard the gunshot and immediately led five people straight to the ditch north of the village, half a mile away from the enemy, and fired at the enemy, killing two of them. At the same time, the militia of Chenglang Village also heard the gunshots and fired at the enemy, hindering the enemy's advance. Later, when the village cadres led the entire village to evacuate, they placed a landmine on the door of the militia's office. As soon as the enemy opened the door, the mine exploded, killing and wounding three enemies, and blasting two to death. Blood and flesh flew across the walls on both sides of the door. The enemy fled in panic. More than ten stones of grain and all the belongings in the office were safe and untouched. The masses suffered less damage. The masses said: "One landmine is worth a battle."

    安阳群众配合反攻
    保丁保粮围困蒋军
    【本报安阳讯】安阳城周群众认透蒋军必败，开展群众性的困死蒋军运动。当我主力转进后，城内敌人疯狂派粮抢粮抓丁，三分庄不到一百户人家，一次便强要六千斤麦、八十斤面饼，因此保粮、保丁、保牲口成为群众的迫切要求。我七、八区武装起来的民兵连，坚决保护群众利益，自上月十二日起，一面连续主动出击，以冷枪爆炸，打击敌人活动，鼓舞群众斗志，一面广泛开展大反攻宣传。他们告城周老百姓说：“大反攻来了，我们眼看要胜利，儿子、粮食是咱们的命，千万不能让蒋军抢走。”这些话群众很爱听，当敌人来时，青年人或报信或随民兵转移，积极配合战斗，主动监视敌人。群众由于有了民兵支持胆子也大起来了。敌军到××村窜扰时，要吃饼，群众故意拖延时间，敌人饭没吃上，民兵接到情报就打来了，气得敌人干急没办法，只好退走，退走后又反扑，民兵只有六人，群众便帮助民兵打，民兵的枪筒打热了，群众给他们连忙上油；民兵打累了，群众监视敌人让他们休息了再打，最后将敌人打走了。群众简直高兴得很，炒鸡蛋给民兵吃。又一次敌人到××庄抢粮，两个妇女就同敌人打起来，不让他们抢。他们把保长打伤了，老百姓把敌人包围住不让走，要和他们进城打官司。×村群众公开对蒋军讲：“八路军好！八路军打了老百姓的碗还给钱。”敌人亦无办法。群众对蒋军的这些软拖硬顶办法，常常给民兵造成很好的歼敌机会，不少村庄采取这种配合办法，打退了敌人抢粮，民兵便抓紧这样的实例，教育群众，群众的决心劲头更大了。民兵活动由于有了群众的配合，变得非常主动，那里有敌人，就往那里去，对于敌人的情况便越摸越熟了。在战斗方法上也改变了过去的牛抵头战术，而采取迂回侧击的办法，使敌进退不安，以减少群众损失。在开展爆炸运动上，更是和群众紧密结合，群众放哨、侦察敌情，民兵结合群众共同埋雷，这就保证了雷不落空，十天战斗中三颗地雷即炸死敌人十二名。现安阳城周围距敌五、六里外之村庄已完全建立革命民主秩序，群众空室藏粮做好了，敌人来，群众就跑（特别是青年人跑），群众孤立敌人，敌人处处陷于被动不敢活动。最近民兵的活动，已伸至平汉路。
    【本报元氏讯】六月二十三日，驻元氏张掖村一带的蒋伪军一百多名到西正庄抢麦子，走近村北许，村长正在村北耕地，发觉敌情即从腰中拿出盒子打了一枪，民兵队长张群昌听见枪声，当即带领五人，直赴村北离敌半里许道沟内，向敌人射击，眼看打倒敌人两个。同时城郎村民兵闻枪声也向敌人射击，阻滞了敌人前进。后来村干部带领全村群众转移走时，将民兵处门上布置了地雷，敌人刚一开门，雷即爆炸，毙伤敌三名炸死二名，血肉横飞直溅门口两边墙上，敌人仓惶逃走，办公处果实麦子十余石，及一切东西安全未动，群众东西少受损失，群众都说：“一个地雷当了一阵。”
