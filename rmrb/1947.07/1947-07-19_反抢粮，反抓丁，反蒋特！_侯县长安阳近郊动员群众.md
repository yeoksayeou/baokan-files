Anti-Grain Seizure, Anti-Conscription, Anti-Chiang Kai-shek Special Agents!
Mobilizing the Masses in the Suburbs of Chang'an County, Anyang
Zhao Wei

The author writes in a letter: "After listening to County Magistrate Hou personally talk about his propaganda and mobilization work in the Anyang front guerrilla zone, I felt that his work experience was worth introducing. But I was afraid that writing a report would be stiff and lose the true feelings, so I wrote it this way. I don't know what kind of writing style this is…" Editor's note: No matter what kind of writing style it is, I think this way of introducing work experience is more lively and suitable for the needs of the fourth page. I hope comrades with experience will use more lively but also summarizing and enlightening language to write.

After we besieged Anyang, the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops in Anyang, in order to prolong their dying breath, constantly went out of the city to seize grain in villages within a ten-mile radius. They also planned to conscript soldiers to replenish their troops, and secretly colluded with local landlords and bad elements, sending secret agents to spy on the local situation. The masses there had been used to enduring under the long-term rule of the Japanese invaders and did not know how to resist. Therefore, County Magistrate Hou went there to conduct propaganda and mobilize the masses. He went with three tasks: one was to mobilize the masses to hide grain, one was to mobilize the masses to cherish young men and not let them be pulled away by the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops to become soldiers, and one was to mobilize the masses to oppose special agents.

He went to a village that was often disturbed by the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops and gathered a group of people. After chatting for a few words, he gradually turned the topic to the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops seizing grain. In order to understand the situation of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops seizing grain, he asked: "When they come, do they look for the village chief to apportion grain, or do they ask you to offer it yourselves?"

An old man said: "Look for the village chief! They can't wait that long! They are the ones who take the sacks and fill them up themselves."

"What kind of grain do they fill? How much does each family need?"

"They want any kind of grain they see. Once they fill it up, it's all gone!"

County Magistrate Hou saw that the masses were very angry, so he planned to ask them to further expose the crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops in order to increase the anger of the masses. He asked: "Don't they claim to be saving the people? Can't you beg them to leave you a little?"

A young man said: "Begging is useless. My family had just milled more than ten catties of flour. That's all the grain I have, and they took it all away. My whole family will have to starve. I boldly begged them to leave a little so my family wouldn't starve to death. Who knew that bastard actually said: 'Even if you starve to death, we can't starve!'"

When County Magistrate Hou heard this, he was very moved, so he repeated it to the masses: "Everyone heard that, right? What kind of heart do the Chiang troops have? They would rather starve the people to death than let them and the puppet troops starve. Aren't they determined to let the people die?!" After a slight pause, he asked again: "Is everyone willing to wait to die?"

The people were silent, sighing, indicating there was no way. County Magistrate Hou wanted them to think of a way, but the people had not thought of an effective way for several years under the rule of the Japanese invaders, and they all said there was no way. Seeing that he couldn't move the people's hearts at once, County Magistrate Hou asked the people about things they had personally experienced: "Is there anyone whose grain hasn't been seized?" His voice and attitude were very sincere, making it impossible for people not to answer him truthfully. An old man opened his mouth and said: "I was lucky, they didn't touch my grain."

County Magistrate Hou followed up and asked: "What method did you use?"

The old man said: "My wheat had just been threshed and was still in the field, not brought home yet. When I saw them coming, I covered it with wheat chaff and straw. They didn't see it, so they didn't take it away."

When County Magistrate Hou heard this, he thought it was very good and knew that the opportunity had come. He immediately used his experience and solemnly and loudly said to the people: "Yes, good, if they don't see it, they can't take it away, if you don't put it in the house, they can't take it away. Put the grain outside the village, far away, like the old folks in the old base areas used to prevent the Japanese from seizing grain."

This sentence moved the hearts of the people, and everyone clamored and shouted: "That's really a good idea!" "It's good to put it outside the village," "It's also okay to put it in the liberated areas. I heard that the people there are good, they don't bully strangers, it doesn't matter."

Seeing that the masses had accepted the suggestion, County Magistrate Hou followed up and encouraged them, proposing a guarantee: "You can transport the grain to the rear, eat a little at home, and transport a little. I guarantee that neither the public nor private can deduct a single grain. I can also help you think of ways. If you have relatives, store it with them, and if you don't have relatives, the government will help you find a place to store it."

The masses were very happy to hear this.

The grain hiding mobilization was successful, and County Magistrate Hou turned the topic to preventing the Chiang troops from conscripting soldiers. He said: "Everyone should also be careful to hide people. The Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops want to conscript young men to supplement the army. The young men should hide!"

Originally, the people in this area had not seen the puppet troops conscripting soldiers and did not believe this, saying: "No need to hide. Guo Qing, Wang Ziquan, they don't use conscription methods. They all want to bring people in. If they want them, you have to give them, not one less. Isn't that better than conscription?"

Seeing that the people had a short-sighted view and were stubborn in their narrow personal experience, County Magistrate Hou could not accept the advice at once, so he stopped talking about it head-on and turned the topic slightly, saying: "They don't conscript soldiers, but they won't not pull laborers to repair work, right?"

These words touched the pain in the people's hearts, and everyone said in unison: "We are afraid of this. They grab us just to work, not to eat."

A strong man immediately complained: "The last time they grabbed me and made me work for two days, I was so hungry that I couldn't even walk back."

Although everyone said this, they still had no way. County Magistrate Hou said: "Everyone should run!"

When the people heard about running, they thought the whole family was running and said: "Where can we run? Where can we run to? Who will give us food? Poor families are hard to leave, we can't run. Broken families are worth a fortune, where can we build another home?"

When County Magistrate Hou heard this, he knew that they had misunderstood, so he explained: "I'm not telling you to run the whole family, run far away, nor am I telling you to run and not come back. I'm saying that when the Chiang troops come to this village, run to that village. When they come to that village, we run even further away. When they leave, we come back. It's not necessarily everyone runs. They grab laborers who have strength, so young and strong people should run, but the old and young don't necessarily have to run!"

The people felt that these words were right, but they worried about not knowing when the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops would come. County Magistrate Hou thought he should tell them to organize, but he thought they wouldn't understand these words, and no one dared to come forward in this area, so he said: "You can secretly collude, send one or two people to watch in the front villages and outside the villages. When you see them coming, quickly come back to send a message. Everyone knows as soon as you collude, and you can all hide without making a sound. This is called organizing, secretly defending."

After he said this, everyone felt that the method was good again and said enthusiastically: "Okay, let's do it this way."

Seeing that the second task had been accepted by the masses, County Magistrate Hou raised the third issue of opposing special agents. He used an enlightening way of saying: "Hiding grain and people running away are all very good, which can make us suffer a lot less losses, but without a domestic thief, you can't attract a foreign ghost. If it weren't for someone in the village who are the enemy's eyes and ears, secret agents, how would the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops know where we have grain and where there are no troops stationed?" Before he finished speaking, an old man said angrily: "That's right, it's those bad guys who brought them in."

County Magistrate Hou continued: "To be truly safe, you still have to eliminate them so that the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops don't have eyes and ears, and naturally they won't be able to come."

The old man said: "We should beat them, but who will make the decision? Can you make the decision?"

When County Magistrate Hou heard this, he immediately said firmly: "The democratic government will definitely make the decision and will also work with everyone to do it."

Then the masses were happy again and said: "As long as the government can make the decision, we dare to do it, and we will definitely be able to do it."

Seeing that the masses had accepted it happily, County Magistrate Hou chatted a few more words, made an appointment with two activists, and then came back.

    反抢粮，反抓丁，反蒋特！
    侯县长安阳近郊动员群众
    赵为
    作者来信说：“听了侯县长亲自谈了他在安阳前线游击区的宣传动员后，觉得他这一工作经验值得介绍。但写作报告，怕死板扳的丧失真情，所以就这么写了，究竟这算一种什么文体呢，我不知道……”编者按：不管它算什么文题吧，我觉得这样介绍工作经验，比较活泼，适合四版的需要。希望有经验的同志们，多采取生动活泼的、但又有总结启发性的文字来写。
    我们围困安阳以后，安阳的蒋伪军为了要拖延他临死的狗命，就不断出城在十里左右的村庄内抢粮，并拟进行抓兵以补充他的部队，还秘密勾结当地地主，坏分子，派遣坐探，刺探当地的情况。那里的群众在日寇长期统治下忍受惯了，不知道反抗，所以侯县长就到那里去宣传并动员群众。他去时带着三个任务：一个是动员群众藏粮，一个是动员群众爱护青年壮丁，不要叫蒋伪军拉了去当兵，一个是发动群众反特。
    他走到一个蒋伪军时常扰乱的村召集了一伙群众，扯了几句闲话，就逐渐把话转向蒋伪军抢粮上来。他为了了解蒋伪军抢粮的情形，就问：“他们来了，找保长摊派粮食呀，还是叫你们自己往外献哪？”
    一个老百姓说：“找保长！他们就等得及！他们是自己动手装布袋”。
    “装甚么粮食呢？一家要多少？”
    “见甚么粮食都要，一装就光！”
    侯县长见群众说得很气愤，就打算叫他们自己把蒋伪军的罪恶再揭发一些，以提高群众的愤恨。就问：“他们不是自称是救老百姓吗？你们不能央告他们给你们留一点吗？”
    一个青年人说：“央告也是没用，我家里刚磨了十多斤面，我就这么点粮食，他们全装走了。我一家子就得挨饿；我大着胆央求他们给留一点，别叫我一家子饿死，谁知那狗东西竟说：饿死你们，也不能饿死我们！”
    侯县长一听这话很动人，就向群众重复一遍：“大家可听见了吧？蒋军是甚么心肠啊，是宁可饿死老百姓也不能饿死他们与伪军，他们这不是决心叫老百姓死吗？！”稍停顿一下，又追问一句：“大家愿意等着死吗？”
    老百姓都默默无言，唉声叹气，表示没办法。侯县长要他们想办法，老百姓几年来在日寇统治下就没想过有效的办法，都说没法子。侯县长见一下打不动老百姓的心，就向群众中找他们亲自验过的事又发问：“有没有谁的粮食没被抢着呢”？他的声音和态度都很诚恳，使人不能不真切地答复他。一个老头开口说：“我万幸，粮食没有被他们摸着”。
    侯县长紧跟着问：“你用甚么办法呢”？
    老头说：“我的麦子刚打完，还在场里，没往家弄；见他们来了，把麦糠、麦秸蒙了蒙；没叫他们看见，才没装走。”
    侯县长一听很好，知道机会来了，就把他这一经验马上发挥了，郑重而响亮的向老百姓说：“对，好，不叫他们看见就抢不了走，不往家里放就抢不了走，把粮食放在村外、远处，以先根地老百姓防日本抢粮用这办法”。
    这句话打动了老百姓的心思，大家七嘴八舌的吵叫起来；“这真是个办法！”“放在村外好，”“放到解放区去也行，听说人家那里好，不欺生，不要紧。”
    侯县长见群众接受了意见，紧跟着鼓励他们，提出保证：“可以把粮食往后运，家里吃一点，运一点，我保证公家私人谁也不能扣一粒；我还可以帮忙想办法，有亲家的投亲家存放，没亲家的政府帮助找地方存放。”
    群众听了都很高兴。
    藏粮动员成功了，侯县长就把话题转向防备蒋军抓丁了，他说：“大家还要留心藏人，蒋伪军要抓青年补充军队，该叫青年人躲躲！”
    原来这一带老百姓没见过伪军抓丁，不相信这话，说：“不用躲，郭青、王自全，不用抓兵的办法，他们都是往里要，人家要，就得给，一个也少不了，比抓不强吗？”
    侯县长见老百姓眼光短，拗于狭隘的亲身经验，一下子不能接受忠告，就不再正面说下去，稍稍把话转了个圈，说：“他们不抓兵，但不会不拉小夫修工吧？”
    这话戳动了老百姓心里的痛苦，大家异口同声的说：“咱就是怕这个，抓去光叫做工，不叫吃饭。”
    一个壮年马上就诉苦说：“上回把我抓去做了两天，饿得都走不回来。”
    大家虽然这么说，但又都没法，侯县长说：“大家要跑呀！”
    老百姓一听说跑，以为全家跑，都说：“跑那里行，跑到那里呢？谁给饭吃？穷家难舍，跑不动；破家值万贯，到那里再弄个家呢？”
    侯县长一听，知道他们误会了，就解释道：“不是叫你全家跑，远处跑，也不是叫你跑了不回来，是说蒋军来到这村，就往那村跑，他到那村，咱们就跑得更远点，他们走了咱再回来。也不一定大家都跑，他抓夫是要有力气的，那么青壮年要跑，老幼可不一定跑！”
    老百姓感觉这话对，但就发愁不知道蒋伪军甚么时候来，侯县长想该告诉他们组织起来，但又想他们不懂得这话，况且在这地区谁也不敢明出头，就说：“你们可以暗暗串通起来，派一两个人到前边村里、村外看着，见他们来了就快回来送信，大家一串通都知道了，也不用声张就都躲出去了，这就叫做组织起来，暗防。”
    话说以后，大家又都觉得办法不错，带劲的说：“行，咱就这么办。”
    侯县长见第二个任务已为群众接受了，就提出第三个反特问题，他用的启发的方式说：“藏粮，人跑都很好，能使咱们少受很多的损失，但没有家贼引不了外鬼来，若不是本村有人家的眼线，暗探，蒋伪军怎会知道咱们那里有粮食，那里没驻军呢？”话没说完一个老百姓就气愤的说：“就是，是那些坏家伙招来的。”
    侯县长接着说：“要得真正安生，还得取消他们，使蒋伪军没有了耳目，自然就来不了。”
    那个老百姓说：“该把他们打了，但谁给作主呢？你们能给做主吗？”
    侯县长听了，马上坚决的说：“民主政府一定做主，还要与大家协同来干。”
    于是群众又高兴了，说：“只要政府能做主，我们就敢干，准能办到。”
    侯县长一见群众愉快的接受了，又扯了两句闲话，约会了两个积极分子，也就回来了。
