Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: TASS Moscow dispatch: New Era magazine recently published an editorial commenting on the Marshall Plan and the European Conference, stating: The Marshall Plan is very sudden and vague, and its purpose is to promote the economic and political expansion of American monopoly groups in Europe. Due to the bankruptcy of the Truman Doctrine's credibility, American expansion has to be carried out under cover, with Bevin and Bidault coming forward to initiate the political drama of the "European Economic Recovery Conference." The truth about the Marshall Plan must have been discussed in detail during the visit of US Undersecretary of State Clayton to London, and in the secret consultations between Bevin and Bidault. The United States and Britain have long wanted to get rid of the post-war economic difficulties and escape the impending crisis at the expense of the interests of the European people. The editorial continued: The conditions for American aid to Europe are absolutely unacceptable to all countries and peoples who are unwilling to trade away their independence; they would rather pursue an independent policy and build the future of their national economy on the solid foundation of their own industry, rather than on the unstable foundation of American handouts. The economic recovery of Europe can be achieved without relying on the American plan mediated by Britain and France, as has been proven by the experience of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. The editorial concluded: European countries have already broken free from the Nazi yoke of forced world domination, and are absolutely unwilling to accept this new American attempt to forcibly dominate the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: TASS London, 11th: The reactionary newspapers of the United States and Britain are heavily promoting the "European Economic Recovery" conference. In the remarks of American commentators, the hypocritical essence of the British and French claim that this conference is only about economics is implicitly revealed. They openly say: Economic power is the best political goal of the United States and its British and French colleagues (who demand the leading position and protector status of the entire Europe). Reuters predicted in advance that countries such as Greece, Turkey, Portugal, and Ireland will definitely obey the plans of Britain and France. London Broadcasting shouted that the Paris "European Conference" will include West Germany in the "European Recovery Master Plan"; the Star newspaper said that Bevin hopes that the French-occupied zone of Germany can be merged with the British and American-occupied zones. However, despite this, the anxiety of Britain and France about the outcome of the conference is growing.

    美英想在欧陆找替死鬼
    以解脱逼近的经济危机
    新时代杂志评马歇尔计划与欧洲会议
    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：新时代杂志顷发表社论，对马歇尔计划与欧洲会议评称：马歇尔计划非常突然与模糊，目的在于推进美国独占集团在欧洲的经济政治扩张。由于杜鲁门主义的信用破产，美国的扩张只好在掩盖下来进行，由贝文及比道尔出面，发起“欧洲经济复兴会议”这幕政治剧。马歇尔计划的实情，一定在美副国务卿克莱顿拜访伦敦时，以及贝文与比道尔的秘密会商中，被详细的讨论到。美国以及英国久已想解脱战后经济的困难，牺牲欧洲人民的利益而逃脱逼近的危机。社论继续称：美国援欧贷款的条件，是所有那些不愿以他们的独立作交易的国家和人民所绝不能接受的；他们宁愿从事独立的政策，并把他们国民经济的前途建设在自己工业的稳固基础上，而不建设在美国布施的不稳固的基础上。欧洲经济的复兴是能够不走倚靠以英法为媒介的美国计划的道路的，这已为苏、南、捷、波等国的经验所证明。社论结语谓：欧洲各国已经挣脱了纳粹强求统治世界的枷锁，绝不愿意再接受美国这种新的统治世界的强求。
    【新华社陕北十四日电】塔斯社伦敦十一日讯：美英的反动报纸，均大事宣传“欧洲经济复兴”会议。在美国评论家的言论中，无形中揭露出英法声言这次会议只谈经济的虚伪本质。他们公开地说：经济威力就是美国以及它底英法同僚（他们要求整个欧洲领袖地位和保护人资格的）的最好政治目标。路透社预先肯定的说：希腊、土耳其、葡萄牙和爱尔兰等国家，一定服从英法的计划。伦敦广播高叫巴黎“欧洲会议”将把德国西部包括到“欧洲复兴总计划”中去；明星报说贝文希望德境法占领区能和英美占领区合并。然而，尽管如此，英法对于会议成果的焦灼却正在增长中。
