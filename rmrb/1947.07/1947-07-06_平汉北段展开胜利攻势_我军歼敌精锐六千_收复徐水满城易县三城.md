　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 [Jin-Cha-Ji] June 30th (Delayed Dispatch): Following the great victory in the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, the Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army launched an offensive on the periphery of Baoding at midnight on June 25th. As of the 28th, we have successively recovered the three county towns of Xushui, Yixian, and Mancheng, as well as many railway station strongholds such as Caohe, Xushui, Gucheng, and Beihedian. Except for the enemy troops defending Yi and Mancheng, who fled upon hearing the news, the rest were annihilated one by one. It is estimated that the entire 362nd Regiment of the 121st Division of the enemy's 94th Army, the entire 325th Regiment of the 109th Division of the 16th Army (both American-equipped regiments), two companies of the 121st Division, a portion of the machine gun and artillery company, and one battalion of the pseudo-Liu Huanan's Security 2nd Division were eliminated, totaling over 1,000 killed and wounded, and over 5,000 captured, including regimental commanders and below. The captured materials are currently being inventoried. We have now controlled nearly 100 li of the railway from Dingxing and Beihedian to Caohe north of Baoding, completely cutting off the Ping-Bao transportation. Baoding is increasingly isolated. Xushui, Yixian, and Mancheng are the 12th, 13th, and 14th county towns recovered by the Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army since the Shijiazhuang peripheral campaign in April.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 [Jin-Cha-Ji] July 2nd (Delayed Dispatch): A unit of the Jidong People's Liberation Army stormed into the important kiln and porcelain engineering area of ​​East and West Gangyao, ten li north of Tangshan, and the nearby spinning factory on the evening of the 20th of last month, seizing a great deal of supplies. After completing their mission, the People's Liberation Army unit safely withdrew. (Attached picture)
