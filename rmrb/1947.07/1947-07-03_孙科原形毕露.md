　　Sun Ke's True Colors Exposed

Sun Ke, the so-called Vice Chairman of the National Government, made a statement on the 22nd of this month, expressing hatred for the Soviet Union externally and hatred for the Communists internally. He actually blamed "the Soviet Union's failure to make the United States' efforts in China succeed" for the fact that the Kuomintang reactionaries tore up the truce order, overturned the Political Consultative Conference line, and caused domestic division. He even blatantly regarded China as the property of the United States, saying that "a cold response from the United States is tantamount to abandoning China." He even whined and acted shamelessly, saying: if that were the case, "among foreign forces in China, only the Soviet Union, the government will reconsider its attitude." This means that if you don't love me, your son, I will recognize someone else as my father. Regarding the issue of restoring domestic peace, he also expressed the ferocious face of the Kuomintang government very clearly. "In military terms, as long as we fight to the end, we can eventually solve the problem." "There is no possibility of peace talks at present. The government must defeat the Communist Party, otherwise the Communist Party will overthrow the National Government."

Since the Political Consultative Conference, Sun Ke has never expressed any dissent towards all the reactionary and perverse actions of the Kuomintang reactionaries. He not only participated in the illegal and divisive so-called National Assembly, but also participated in the so-called government reorganization. He finally managed to get a bone from Chiang Kai-shek, and when the Kuomintang was nearing its end and Sun Ke was nearing his old age, he got the title of Vice Chairman. These were already enough to expose his true colors. But unforgiving history is forcing him even further, forcing him to strip off all his past pretenses of liberalism and alliance with the Soviet Union and the Communists, and dance naked. Sun Ke's ugliness shows that Chiang Kai-shek's small court is already on fire, and the people who wake up in their dreams and run into the streets shouting for help often don't bother to put on their pants.

Among all the bureaucrats of the Chinese Kuomintang, Sun Ke is the most shameless and fickle clown. He is the unworthy descendant of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Not long after Mr. Sun's death, he betrayed his father's will and joined the ultra-right-wing Western Hills Conference faction. During the Great Revolution, he joined the left-wing Wuhan government, and then he went to Nanjing to seek an official position. He supported and opposed Chiang, sinking and floating. After being demoted to the Legislative Yuan, he seemed to be leaning to the left, but he presided over the formulation of the notorious May 5th Dictatorship Draft Constitution. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, when he was squeezed out of the Chiang Kai-shek clique and had no way out, he expressed his inclination to the left, wore a pro-Soviet mask, and visited the Soviet Union. In 1941, Chiang Kai-shek only slightly bought him off, and he immediately cursed the CCP and the Democratic League (the predecessor of the China Democratic League, which at that time also included the Youth Party and the National Socialist Party) in Hong Kong. In January 1942, when the United States was at a military disadvantage against Japan, he issued the famous separate peace talk statement (Separate Peace) with Japan on the orders of Chiang Kai-shek. The purpose was the same as today, to extort 500 million yuan in loans from the United States. Later, he fell out of favor again, and then became the so-called Kuomintang left wing, until the opening of the Political Consultative Conference in January last year. Sun Wukong has seventy-two transformations, and Sun Ke's changes are no less than that when calculated carefully. But the underlying principle remains the same: he only seeks profit. He will certainly change in the future, but it will be difficult to deceive the masses again. The masses do not need such liars; nor will they allow liars to ride on the backs of the people forever, fighting for power and profit. Sun Ke and his ilk have only one future, which is called the collapse of the tree and the scattering of the monkeys. The reason why Sun Ke is frantically shouting for help this time is precisely to escape this future, but he will not achieve his goal.

Sun Ke and the entire Chiang Kai-shek dynasty have been busy creating various incidents and rumors to oppose the Soviet Union since the People's Liberation Army launched counter-offensives in a wide range of areas. Why is this? There is a secondary domestic purpose, and a main foreign purpose. Domestically, this small court wants to divert the people's attention from the anti-civil war, anti-hunger, and anti-atrocity movements, but this is only secondary, because the people have long lost trust in Nanjing's propaganda. What the Central News Agency says is black, the fact must be white. This can be seen clearly from its various slanders against the people's movement. In fact, the people are extremely indifferent to the small court's clamor. Students continue to fight against atrocities, and hungry people continue to seize rice. In addition, this small court also wants to win over a group of people at home who basically rely on it but are also grumbling. But it is obvious that even if this group of people stop grumbling and follow the party headquarters to issue a couple of anti-Soviet and anti-Communist telegrams, it will not be able to save the decline of the Nanjing dynasty. Therefore, its main purpose is abroad. The United States has been assisting Nanjing for so long, and the money spent is not small, but what is the result? Some realistic American political figures are beginning to recognize and consider that this extremely small puppet stage is an extremely large bottomless pit. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek, Sun Ke, and the like have to show off their talent for making false accounts. This is undoubtedly the most skilled profession of all corrupt officials in Nanjing, to try to change the emotions of these Americans, so that they not only do not waver, but also more enthusiastically fill this bottomless pit. The Chiang family's small court first wants to make its American masters angry and come out to oppose the so-called "aggression" of the Soviet Union; second, it wants to make its American masters afraid of its son's announcement in the newspaper of severing the father-son relationship. This latter tactic, according to the Nanjing Ministry of National Defense's habit, should be named the rolling tactic. Chiang Kai-shek not only directed Sun Ke to perform, but also personally performed it himself, and both have been effective. Whether it will still be effective this time remains to be seen in the next episode. But it can be predicted that some Americans will be like Kong Yiji in Lu Xun's novel, covering the plate of fennel beans with five fingers, and saying repeatedly: "Is it too much? Not much!" And another group of die-hard Americans will still provide military and financial assistance openly or secretly. The people of China and the United States must continue to resolutely oppose any such sinful assistance, because it only prolongs China's chaos and suffering, and this fact is clearer than ever. But the Nanjing executioners who insist on "fighting to the end" can never be saved by this. The more blood debts that Chiang Kai-shek, Sun Ke, and anyone else accumulate from betraying the country and harming the people, the greater the interest they must pay to the people on the day when "the problem can be solved in the end."

### 孙科原形毕露

专栏：新华社时评

　　孙科原形毕露
    所谓国民政府副主席的孙科，在本月二十二日发表谈话，对外仇苏、对内仇共。他居然把国民党反动派撕毁停战令，推翻政协路线，造成国内分裂的事实，归罪于“苏联不能使美国在中国的努力成功”；并且公然把中国当做美国的家产，说什么“美国反响冷淡即等于对中国放弃。”他甚至撒娇放赖地说：如果那样“是在中国之外国势力，惟有苏联，政府将重新考虑态度”。意思是说你再不疼我这个儿子，我就要认旁人做老子了。对于恢复国内和平的问题，他把国民党政府的凶恶面孔也表示得再鲜明没有。“在军事方面，只要打到底终归可以解决。”“目前概无和谈可言，政府必须打垮共党，否则即是共党推翻国民政府”。
    从政治协商会议以后，孙科对于国民党反动派的一切倒行逆施，从未表示过异议。他不但参加了违法的分裂的所谓国民大会，而且参加了所谓政府改组。总算蒙蒋介石赐了根肉骨头，当国民党日暮途穷，孙科也年暮途穷的时候，得了个副主席的称号。这些本来已够暴露他的原形了。但是不饶人的历史，却要逼他更进一步，要他把向来的什么自由主义呀，联苏联共呀，这一套遮羞物通通剥光，来个裸体跳舞。孙科的丑态表示蒋介石小朝廷已经着了火，而在睡梦中惊醒，跑到大街上狂呼救命的人，常常是顾不得穿裤子的。
    在中国国民党的一切官僚之中，孙科是最为寡廉鲜耻反复无常的丑角。他是孙中山先生的不肖子孙，先生逝世不久，他就背叛他父亲的遗嘱，参加极右翼的西山会议派。大革命中他又投入左派的武汉政府，然后他又到南京寻求一官半职。联蒋倒蒋，载沉载浮。贬入立法院后，似乎左倾了，却又主持制订了臭名昭著的五五独裁宪草。抗战期间，被蒋介石集团挤得没有出路的时候，又表示向左，并戴着亲苏的面具，访问了一趟苏联。一九四一年蒋介石仅仅稍微收买他一下，他立即在香港大骂中共与民主政团同盟（民主同盟的前身。当时还包括青年党、国社党在内）。一九四二年一月正当美国对日军事不利，他奉蒋介石之命发表了著名的对日单独讲和（Ｓｅｐｅｒａｆｅ　Ｐｅａｃｅ）的谈话。其目的与今天相同，就是向美国勒索五万万元的借款。以后他又失宠了，于是又成为所谓国民党左派，直到去年一月政治协商会议的开幕。孙行者有七十二变，孙科的变化细算起来也不下此数。但是万变不离其宗，就是唯利是图。他以后当然还会变，但再要欺骗群众是难了。群众不需要这样的骗子；也不允许骗子们永远骑在人民的头上争权逐利。孙科及其同类只有一个前途，叫做树倒猢狲散。孙科这次所以狂呼救命，正是为了逃脱这个前途，但是他将达不到自己的目的。
    孙科和整个蒋介石王朝自从人民解放军在广泛地区举行反攻以来，就一直忙于制造各种事件和谣言，来反对苏联，这是为什么呢？这有一个次要的国内目的，还有一个主要的国外目的。在国内这个小朝廷想要转移人民反内战反饥饿、反暴行运动的视线，但这只是次要的，因为人民早已对南京的宣传丧失信任。中央社说是黑，事实一定是白，这从它对人民运动的各种诬蔑，就可以看清楚了。事实上人民对于小朝廷的叫嚣也是极端冷漠。学生们继续反暴行的斗争，饥饿的人们也继续抢米。此外这个小朝廷，还想争取国内一部分基本上依靠它但又唧唧哝哝的人们。但是很明显的，这一部分人即使停止唧唧哝哝，跟着党部发个把反苏讨共的通电，也并不能挽救南京王朝的没落。所以它的主要目的，是在国外。美国援助南京这么久了，花的钱不为不多，但是结果如何呢？若干现实的美国政界人物，开始认识和考虑这个极小的傀儡舞台，乃是一个极大的无底洞。于是蒋介石、孙科之流不得不拿出他们造假帐的天才。这无疑是南京一切贪官污吏们最熟练的职业，来企图转变这些美国人的情绪，使他们不仅不动摇，而且更加起劲地填满这个无底洞。蒋家小朝廷第一是要使美国主人们生气出面反对所谓苏联的“侵略”；第二是要使美国主人们害怕他的儿子的登报脱离父子关系。这后一种战术，按照南京国防部的习惯，应该定名为打滚战术。蒋介石不但指挥孙科表演过，而且他本人也亲自表演过，而且都曾经行之有效。这一次是否仍然有效，还须听下回分解。但是可以预料的是有一部分美国人将如鲁迅小说中的孔乙己似的，将五指罩住茴香豆的碟子，连说：“多乎哉，不多也！”而另一部分美国死硬派，则仍将或明或暗地给以军事和财政的援助。中国和美国的人民，必须继续坚决反对任何这类罪恶的援助，因为这仅是以延长中国的混乱和痛苦，这个事实已是比任何时候更加明白了，但是坚持“打到底”的南京刽子手们，无论如何却永远不能由此得救。蒋介石孙科以及其他任何人由此所积的卖国殃民的血债愈多，到“终归可以解决”的一天，他们就必须向人民付出更大的利息。
