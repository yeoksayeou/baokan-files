　　A Conscious Political Armed Force
  　The People-Cherishing Movement on the Northern Henan Front
    Zhu Yaoting
    During the Northern Henan Campaign in May, the emancipated peasants of Taihang Mountain, while engaged in busy war support tasks, universally launched a people-cherishing movement, becoming a conscious political armed force.

    Under the slogans of "Defend Chairman Mao, Defend the Land" and "Fight Little Chiang and Old Chiang Together," the enthusiasm of the old liberated area's masses to participate in the war reached an unprecedented high. However, it also carried considerable arrogance. As soon as they joined the ranks, they believed they had become public servants and that the masses should support them. At the same time, due to the narrowness of class consciousness, they could clearly distinguish camps and conduct struggles in the base areas, but after arriving in the new areas, they became blurred. They believed that the masses in the new areas had been corrupted by the Kuomintang and were all stubborn elements. On the other hand, due to the Kuomintang's various shameless rumors in the new areas and the cruel oppression and plunder of the masses by the Chiang's puppet troops, the masses believed that just as the "Central Army" beat and scolded ordinary people, the Eighth Route Army would be no different... Furthermore, differences in language and living habits further exacerbated the estrangement between the two sides. Even to the point that when the participating troops arrived in some new places, the young and middle-aged men ran away, and young women hid in the cave dwellings, burying their belongings, leaving only some elderly people to pretend to be deaf and dumb to provide some support. As a result, some participating masses violated discipline, arbitrarily took things from the homes of landlords and despots, and forced the masses to vacate their houses, and other bad phenomena occurred. After the leadership discovered these situations, they first educated all cadres to recognize the seriousness of the problem, which aroused the cadres' vigilance. Then, after deliberation, a discipline inspection team was formed to commend and criticize, with clear rewards and punishments. At the same time, mass ideological education was launched, with participating masses educating each other and new and old area masses educating each other, which raised the masses' class consciousness and implemented the idea that all peasants in the world are one family. They successively formulated conscious discipline. Shexian and Pingshun immediately proposed the "Three No Go" movement: 1. Do not leave until the water buckets are filled. 2. Do not leave until the ground is swept clean. 3. Do not leave until the borrowing procedures are clear. This changed the understanding of the masses in the new areas and launched a people-cherishing movement.

    I. Visiting to Share Grievances and Joys, Disguised Propaganda.

    After establishing the idea that "all peasants in the world are one family," the old area peasants clarified their responsibility to help their poor brothers in the new areas, and automatically went in groups of two or three to visit the masses in their stationed areas, gradually contacting the village cadres and convening "visiting to share grievances and joys" forums for the new and old area masses. The new area masses, one after another, poured out how they had been oppressed and plundered by local emperors such as Wang Ziquan and Hu Quanlu, as well as the exploitation and reverse accounting of special agent landlords over the years, and how they had ended up with no food, no clothing, and suffering from cold and hunger. The old area masses talked about how they had suffered in the past, and how the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army had come to help the poor fight for emancipation, and how they now had food and clothing, and the government was helping them develop their production and get rich. The masses stationed in the Ci County stretcher teams thought that the stretcher bearers were all conscripted, and that they would definitely be drafted into the army in the future. In the "visiting to share grievances and joys", they introduced themselves as emancipated households who volunteered to participate in the war in order to defend the fruits of emancipation, gradually breaking the doubts of the masses in the new areas. The participating masses in Pingshun, Ci County and other counties organized disguised propaganda, performing Yangko dances and street dramas on the streets at night, showing how they had become emancipated, and composing the suffering of the masses in the new areas into various ditties and clappers, singing and performing everywhere at any time. The men, women, and children of the new area masses lit lamps and torches to watch, and enviously talked to each other: "The stretcher team is so happy away from home, I don't know how it should be at home." Lucheng and Shexian set up "blackboard newspapers," "radio stations," and "meat telegraph poles" to spread victory news, commend models, liven up the lives of the participating masses, consolidate the enthusiasm for participation, and greatly educate the masses in the stationed areas, exposing the shameless rumors of the Chiang's puppet troops, and conducting an effective disinfection in the minds of the masses in the new areas.

    II. Saving and Frugality to Help Poor Brothers.

    The masses in the new areas had little food and clothing, and the old and weak begged everywhere, arousing the class sympathy of the participating masses, who decided to vigorously help their poor brothers. The militia of the Fifth District of Wu'an proposed "participating in the war without forgetting the poor," saving two liang of millet per person per day to help the local masses, saving 475 jin of millet in five days. County Chief Cheng then led the call, and after everyone's discussion, it was decided that April 16th would be the "People-Cherishing and Frugality Day." Within one day, 2,262 jin of millet were saved. After being commended by the Logistics Headquarters, the participating masses in various counties universally launched a savings and disaster relief movement. Sun Laisheng, a militia member of Shexian, used his only 2,000 yuan to help an old woman.

    III. Doing Whatever They Can to Help the Masses with Production.

    Helping the masses with production is the central issue of the people-cherishing movement, but they also encountered difficulties when they started doing it. When Gui Shoujin of Shexian went to work for Guo Zhende in Qianliujiang, Guo Zhende said: "I have no land, where does the livelihood come from?" Because the masses had never seen an army willing to help ordinary people with production, they assumed that they would have to eat and ask for money after doing the work, or divide the grain in the future. The stretcher militia then generated the idea that "the masses in the new areas are just stubborn, they still bite their fingers even when they are coated with honey." After discussion, it was realized that Chiang’s puppet troops had scared the ordinary people by extortion. Everyone then proposed to "do a good job so that the ordinary people can recognize us." Shexian proposed "eat enough (your own) and do a good job," and also stipulated "no eating, no asking for money, no smoking." Pingshun also called on the masses to actively work for the masses, with the Eight Immortals displaying their unique abilities. Thus, Gui Shoujin of Shexian secretly hoeed more than ten mu of wheat for Guo Zhende, and after hoeing, he invited him to inspect it. Cui Tiancheng of Ci County saw that the latrine of his landlord was full and automatically carried it away. After carrying it away, he cleaned it with ash. In the work, he also told them stories from the base area. So, they curiously spread it everywhere, vying to find participating masses to work for them.

    "It is really like exchanging gold bricks for jade bricks, exchanging hearts for hearts. If we respect him by a foot, he will respect us by a yard." "Speak frankly and you will know the heart. It turns out that everyone is one family." After working for the masses, they were also asked to use furniture and actively solve various difficulties. After Gui Shoujin and others worked for the masses, the masses cooked good food and asked them to eat, but they did not eat. An old woman took advantage of the time when their cook was changing beans, secretly buried eggs in the beans and sent them away. After being discovered, they were sent back. At this time, the emotions of the stretcher militia were even higher, and helping the masses with production has become a lively movement. They proposed "do what you can do, do what the masses need." Hoeing wheat, planting fields, harvesting, building houses, making spinning wheels, carrying latrines—the stretcher team did all the work that the masses needed. The Wu'an stretcher team formed a pot-repairing team, repairing pots for the masses in districts and villages. The masses all said: "When the Central Army comes, they break the pots; when the Eighth Route Army comes, they repair the pots."

    When it was dry and there was no rain and seeds could not be planted, the stretcher militia helped the masses with spot planting and introduced the old area's drought prevention experience. The Pingshun stretcher team helped the village cadres inspect the mutual aid groups (in villages where work had been done) and disseminated the valuable experience of the old area in organizing production. During the wheat harvest, they also organized the masses to carry out harvesting in a planned manner, proposing "cut wherever you go," so that the new area could quickly complete the harvest task.

    After the stretcher militia worked for the masses, they also left "thoughts." The Ci County stretcher team built three new houses for the masses, pasted "Built by the Ci County Stretcher Team" on the beams, and held a mass meeting in the courtyard to inspect the work. Some stretcher teams invited their landlords to eat and chat about their families before leaving, and exchanged hometown addresses and names with the villagers, becoming like relatives and friends. Many people were reluctant to leave, even when sent to the outskirts of the village.

    According to incomplete statistics from seven counties, including Ci County, Huguan, Wu'an, Lucheng, Linxian, and Licheng, a total of 10,954 mu of wheat were hoeed. 1,353 mu of land were irrigated, 6,774 mu of wheat were harvested, 8,415 loads of manure were carried, 15 new houses were built, 9 dilapidated houses were repaired, 17 grinding wheels were forged, 1,222 mu of land were hoeed, 201.5 mu of land were planted, 183 mu of cotton were planted, and there were countless other miscellaneous tasks.

    In addition to production, they also helped the masses clean courtyards and streets. The participating doctors also took the initiative to treat the masses without asking for money, moving the masses in the new areas to tears, and universally spreading the word that "this world is really rare, doctors do not ask for money for treatment."

    IV. Only When All the Peasants in the World Are Emancipated Can We Uproot Chiang Kai-shek's Roots.

    Helping the masses in the new areas to become emancipated is a further improvement and development of the people-cherishing movement. The masses proposed "only when all the peasants in the world are emancipated can we uproot Chiang Kai-shek's roots." From their own experience of emancipation, the peasants realized that the greatest suffering of the peasants is class oppression, and only emancipation can completely liberate them, and only on the basis of emancipation can the unity between the new and old areas be consolidated. Therefore, in the savings and production movement, the stretcher militia of Ci County, Shexian, Huguan, Pingshun and other counties were also involved in the movement to help the masses in the new areas to become emancipated.

    Using helping the masses with production as a bridge, in the course of working and chatting, they used their own past suffering to lead to their suffering. Through "visiting to share grievances and joys," disguised propaganda, the masses were made to understand the policy of "land to the tiller," inspiring their demand for emancipation and creating a wave of emancipation. Then, the masses were quickly mobilized to confiscate the property of traitors and distribute it to the poor masses as relief. If they stayed in a place for a relatively long time, after understanding the situation, they would cooperate with the local village cadres to jointly study the organization of struggles, to support the masses, to take charge, and to ignite them. Ci County once extracted more than 40 experienced cadres to form 12 emancipation groups. The head of the emancipation group would combine with the head of the production group. Whenever they went to a place, the head of the group would contact the village cadres, mobilize the masses to find a livelihood, and be responsible for dispatching labor. Then, they would repeatedly carry out propaganda and education for the masses in the new areas while producing. When the Third District lived in Yingxin, they colluded through telling grievances, organized more than 40 hired laborers and poor peasants to participate in the peasant association, and mobilized everyone to hold grievance meetings to carry out struggles and distribute land and wheat.

    This conscious political armed force has mobilized the masses in the new areas in this way, strengthened the class unity of the masses in the new and old areas, and mobilized the army and the people to unite and form a united struggle against the traitor Chiang Kai-shek.

　　一支自觉的政治武装
  　豫北前线的民爱民运动
    朱耀庭
    五月豫北战役中，参战的太行翻身农民，在繁忙的战勤任务中，普遍展开了民爱民运动，成为一支自觉的政治武装。
    在“保卫毛主席保卫土地”，“小蒋老蒋一齐斗”的口号下，老区群众的参战情绪空前高涨，但也带有相当的骄气，一站起队来便以为自己成了公家人，群众应该支应自己。同时由于阶级观念的狭隘，在根据地能够划清阵营进行斗争，来到新区后就模糊起来，以为新区群众被国民党教坏了，都是顽固蛋。另一方面国民党在新区的种种无耻造谣，及蒋伪军对群众残酷的压榨掠夺，群众便以为“中央军”打骂老百姓，八路军也一定差不多，……同时，语言与生活习惯不同，更促成双方的隔阂，甚至参战队伍到某些新地方，青壮年跑个不见面，年轻妇女都躲到窑洞里，家里东西埋藏起来，剩下些老年人装聋做哑的支应一阵。因而也发生一些参战群众破坏纪律，乱拿地主恶霸家里的东西，强迫群众腾房子等坏现象。领导上发现这些情况后，首先教育所有干部认识这一问题的严重性，引起了干部的警觉。随即进行酝酿，组成纪律检查团，表扬批评，赏罚严明，同时展开群众性的思想教育，参战群众相互教育，新老区群众相互教育，提高了群众阶级觉悟，贯彻了天下农民是一家的思想。纷纷订出自觉纪律。涉县、平顺立即提出三不走运动：一、担不满水就不走。二、地扫不净不走。三、借东西手续不清不走。转变了新区群众的认识，展开了民爱民运动。
    一、访苦谈喜、化装宣传。
    树立了“天下农民是一家”的思想后，老区农民明确了自己有帮助新区穷弟兄翻身的责任，就自动的三三两两去访问驻地群众，慢慢和村干取得联系，召开了新老区群众“访苦谈喜”座谈会。新区群众你几句我几句的，倾吐历年来如何受王自全、扈全禄等土皇帝的压榨掠夺和特务地主的剥削倒算，到现在落得没吃没穿受冻挨饿，老区群众则谈他们过去如何受痛苦，共产党八路军来了后，如何帮助穷人斗争翻身，现在的时光是有吃有穿，政府还要帮助生产闹发家。磁县担架驻地群众以为担架都是抓来的，将来一定要编兵，他们就在访苦谈喜中介绍自己都是翻身户，为了保卫翻身果实而自愿参战的，逐渐打破了新区群众的怀疑。平顺、磁县等县参战群众则组织了化装宣传，夜晚在街上出演秧歌与街头剧，表演自己怎样翻身，并把新区群众的痛苦编成各色各样的小调快板，随时在各处歌唱表演，新区群众男女老少掌灯点火出来观看，都羡慕的相互交谈：“担架队离家在外还这么高兴，在家里还不知该怎样哩”。潞城涉县则设立“黑板报”“广播台”“肉电杆”等，传播胜利消息，表扬模范，活跃了参战群众的生活，巩固了参战情绪，更大大教育了驻地群众，揭穿了蒋伪军的无耻造谣，在思想上替新区群众来了一次有效的消毒。
    二、省吃俭用救济穷弟兄。
    新区群众少吃没穿，老弱到处讨乞，引起了参战群众的阶级同情心，决定要大力救济穷弟兄。武安五区民兵提出“参战不忘穷人”，每人每天节约小米二两，救济当地群众，五天内节约小米四百七十五斤。程县长随即领导号召，经大家讨论：决定四月十六日为民爱民节约日。一天内就节约小米二千二百六十二斤，经后勤指挥部通报表扬后，各县参战群众普遍展开节约救灾运动。涉县民兵孙来生将自己仅有的两千元救济了一个老太婆。
    三、会啥干啥帮助群众生产。
    帮助群众生产是民爱民运动的中心问题，但在开始做时也都碰了钉子。涉县桂守金去给前柳江的郭振德干活时，郭振德说：“我没有地，那里来的营生”。因为群众从没有见过军队肯帮助老百姓生产，便以为做了活后一定要吃饭要钱，或者将来分粮食。担架民兵便又产生了“新区群众就是顽固，往嘴里抹蜜还咬指头”的想法。经过讨论才知道是蒋伪军把老百姓讹诈怕了，大家便提出一定要“好好干，使老百姓认清咱们”。涉县提出“吃饭要吃饱（自己的）干活要干好”，还订出规矩“不吃饭，不要钱，不吸烟”。平顺也号召主动给群众干活，八仙过海各显神通。于是涉县桂守金偷偷地给郭振德锄了十多亩麦子，锄好后还请他来检查。磁县崔天成见房东茅厕满了就自动去担，担完了还用灰垫得干干净净的。干活中又给他们讲根据地的故事，于是他们新奇地到处传播，争着找参战群众去干活。
    “真是金砖换玉砖，人心换人心，咱敬他一尺，他敬咱一丈”，“说透话，方知心，原来都是一家人”。给群众干活后，家具也叫用了，还主动的给解决各种困难，桂守金他们给群众干活后，群众给做好饭叫他们吃，他们不吃，一个老太婆便趁他们的伙夫换豆子时，把鸡蛋偷埋在豆子里给送去，发觉后，又送回去了。这时担架民兵们的情绪更高了，帮助群众生产已成为热火朝天的运动。提出了“会啥干啥，群众需要啥干啥”。锄麦、种地、抢收、盖房子、做纺车、担茅厕——所有群众需要的活担架都做了。武安担架组成补锅队，分区分村给群众补锅，群众都说：“中央军来了打锅，八路军来了补锅。”
    天旱不雨，不能下种时，担架民兵又帮助群众点种，介绍老区防旱经验。平顺担架则帮助村干部检查互助组（有过工作的村庄），传播老区组织生产的宝贵经验，麦收时又有计划的组织群众进行抢收，提出“走到那割到那”，使新区迅速完成抢收任务。
    担架民兵给群众干活后，还留下了“想头”，磁县担架队给群众盖好三间新房子，在梁上贴了“磁县担架队盖成的”，并在院子里开了群众大会来验工。有的担架临走时请房东吃饭谈家常，和老乡们互相留下了家乡地址、姓名、简直成了亲朋，好多群众，直送到村外还恋恋不舍。
    根据磁县、壶关、武安、潞城、林县、黎城等七县不完全的统计，共锄麦子一○九五四亩。浇地一三五三亩，割麦子六七七四亩，担粪八四一五担，盖新房十五间，修破房九间，锻磨十七＠，锄地一二二二亩，种地二○一·五亩，点种棉花一八三亩，及其他杂活无算。
    除了生产外，他们还帮群众打扫院落街道，参战医生也主动的不要钱给群众看病，感动得新区群众落泪，普遍传诵着“这个世道真希罕，医生看病不要钱”。
    四、天下农民都翻身，才能刨掉老蒋根
    帮助新区群众翻身，是民爱民运动进一步的提高和发展。群众提出“天下农民都翻身，才能刨掉老蒋根”。农民从自己翻身经验中体会出，农民最大的痛苦是阶级压迫，只有翻身才能彻底解放，也只有在翻身基础上新老区团结才会巩固。因之，在节约生产运动中，磁县、涉县、壶关、平顺等县担架民兵又卷入帮助新区群众翻身运动。
    以帮助群众生产为桥梁，在做活谈家常中，拿自己过去的苦来引他们的苦，经过“访苦谈喜”谈及化装宣传，使群众了解耕者有其田的政策，启发他们的翻身要求，造成翻身热潮。然后迅速发动群众没收汉奸财产，带救济性的分配给贫苦群众。若在一个地方住的较长，在了解情况后，就和当地区村干部配合，共同研究组织斗争，给群众撑腰作主点火发动。磁县曾抽出四十多个有经验的干部，组成十二个翻身小组，翻身小组长结合生产小组长，每到一处，小组长就和村干部接头，在群众中动员找营生，并负责派工，然后一面生产一面对新区群众反复宣传教育。三区在英新住时，曾诉苦串通，组织了四十多个雇工赤贫参加农会，发动大家开诉苦大会，进行斗争，分配土地和麦子。
    这一支自觉的政治武装，就这样动员了新区群众，加强了新老区群众的阶级团结，动员了军队人民团结一致地组成了对卖国贼蒋介石的联合大斗争。
