　　Lingchuan County Government Saves People's Labor
  　Organizes Personnel to Go to the Countryside for Tax Deeds
    [Our Newspaper, Lingchuan News] The county government pays attention to saving people's labor and organizes tax deed teams to go to the countryside for tax deeds. After the land reform, farmers urgently requested that their land and houses be guaranteed, and were eager to obtain tax deeds. However, because the mountain roads were rugged and far from the city, a round trip took some two days, and some took three days. They all felt that the work was too much of a delay, and the expenses outside were high. One day's expenses were enough for the family to use for two days.
    According to the demands of the masses, the county government changed the old method of sitting in the office and waiting for tax deeds. It formed tax deed teams and went to the countryside by district to handle tax deeds. The seven districts of the county were divided into three phases in order of priority. The first phase was for the sixth and seventh districts, the second phase was for the first and third districts, and the third phase was for the second, fourth, and fifth districts. The masses all reflected, "The government is really good, we can handle tax deeds without delaying production."　　　　(Jie Zhong)

　　陵川县府节约民力
  　组织人员下乡税契
    【本报陵川讯】县府注意节约民力，组织税契队下乡税契。土地改革后，农民迫切要求自己的土地房屋得到保障，急于税契。可是因山路崎岖，离城很远，往返一趟，有的两天，有的要费三天，都觉着工夫误不起，在外盘费消耗大，一天消耗够家里两天用。
    县府根据群众要求，改变了坐机关等税契的旧办法，组成税契队，分区下乡税契，把全县七个区按先后划分了三期，第一期进行六、七区，第二期一、三区，第三期二、四、五区。群众都反映说：“政府就是好，咱们能税契还误不了生产。”　　　　（介中）
