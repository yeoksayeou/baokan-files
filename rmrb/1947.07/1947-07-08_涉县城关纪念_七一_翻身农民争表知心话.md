【This newspaper Shexian News】The masses in the ninth district of Shexian joyfully celebrated the Party's birthday. Before the arrival of "July 1st," government offices and the masses were actively taking action to welcome this beloved day. Jiang Buge's family in the city made preparations for famine relief, exchanging harvested wheat for millet. The old man collected manure, and his daughter-in-law spun yarn and gathered vegetables; the whole family was highly motivated. Wang Shuyong, an emancipated peasant from Nangang, mobilized the entire village to collect more than 2,600 catties of wild vegetables. Comrade Chen Tucheng of Shangqingliang led the entire village to convert more than 120 mu of land previously used for tobacco cultivation to growing corn. Cadres from county-level government offices and the Normal School collectively studied the Party's history of struggle, enhancing everyone's understanding of the Party. After dusk, in the food markets on the streets of Chengguan, people everywhere were recalling their experiences of emancipation, understanding that their newfound benefits were given by the Communist Party, and that Chairman Mao was their savior. On "July 1st," the masses from nine villages near Chengguan and 3,000 people from the Normal School rushed to the city to participate in the conference. Li Yichun, a 54-year-old relative of a soldier from the east street of Chengguan, couldn't sleep for a long time on the eve of "July 1st," thinking about what gift he should bring to the Communist Party for its birthday. The next morning, he got up early and went to the street to buy a piece of red paper, writing his heartfelt words: "Chairman Mao! I have been emancipated, rising from abject poverty to a middle peasant. Now I have food and clothing, and I will never forget you, never forget the Communist Party. From now on, I will listen to you, and I will do whatever you say. ......" The women and masses of Chengguan asked others to write down their thoughts and send them to the county committee. At the conference, the county committee announced the list of 204 outstanding Party members in Shexian who had heroically struggled, worked hard, and wholeheartedly served the masses during the ten years of struggle. The masses present carefully read the list of martyrs, recalling their glorious deeds. At the beginning of the conference, Comrade Luo, the county secretary, summarized the history of the Shexian Party's ten years of struggle. He said, "Today, the Shexian Party has gained such support from the masses because it has painstakingly done things for the masses for ten years. In the future, we must lead everyone to do more work and actively support the counter-offensive." He also called on everyone: Whether it is government offices, schools, or the masses, we must start now to save 100 days of living expenses, and call on everyone to save 50 catties of dried vegetables to prepare for famine. Finally, he said with great certainty and confidence: "Everyone works hard, man will conquer nature, we will definitely overcome the disaster and completely defeat Chiang Kai-shek." Then, He Zhonghua, an emancipated peasant from Qingliang, took the stage and said: "Without the Communist Party, I would have no good days. I want to rely on the Communist Party as my strong support, actively support the counter-offensive, and defeat Chiang Kai-shek to protect our good life!" A retired soldier from Qingliang thanked the Party and the masses for their care at the conference. Women, students... all took the stage to express their love for the Party. Speakers crowded continuously, eager to tell their thoughts to their benefactor - the Communist Party. Slogans rose and fell in the venue, and the shouts shook the fields. The eyes of the people present were fixed on the people speaking on the stage, excitedly unable to close their lips. The meeting did not end until dusk.

　　涉县城关纪念“七一”
  　翻身农民争表知心话
    【本报涉县讯】涉县九区群众欢欣渡过党的生日。“七一”来临前夕，机关、群众皆纷纷以自己的实际行动来迎接这个可爱的日子。城里江步阁全家作了备荒计划，将收的麦子换成小米，老汉拾粪、儿媳妇纺织采菜，全家人劲头很大。南岗翻身农民王书用推动全村打野菜二千六百余斤。上清凉陈土成同志领导全村，将历年种菸的一百二十余亩地，改种玉茭。县级机关干部、师范学校，集体学习党的斗争史，提高了大家对党的认识。黄昏后城关的街头饭市上、到处都有人在回忆自己的翻身经过，明确了自己的翻身利益是共产党给的，毛主席是救命恩人。“七一”这天，城关附近九个村群众及师范学校三千余人，忙忙赶赴城里参加大会；城里东街五十四岁的抗属老汉李义春在“七一”前夜，好长时间没睡着觉，心里想着说不来拿些啥礼物去给共产党做生日最好，第二天清早一早起来就去街上买了一张红纸，写上自己的心里话：“毛主席！我可翻了身啦，由赤贫升到中农，现在我有吃有穿，我永远忘不了你，忘不了共产党，以后要听你的话，你说啥我就干啥。……………”城关的妇女和群众们都把自己的心事话找人写起来送给了县委会。大会上，县委公布了涉县党在十年斗争中英勇奋斗艰苦工作全心全意为群众而牺牲了的二百零四名优秀党员名单，到会的群众细心的阅看着烈士们的名单，追忆他们的光荣史绩。大会开始县书罗同志总结了涉县党十年斗争的历史，他说：“今天涉县党所以能得到群众的如此拥护，是因为十年中辛辛苦苦给群众办了事，今后还要领导大家做更多的工作，积极支援反攻。”他并号召大家：无论机关、学校、群众，从现在着手要节省一百天的生活，并号召每人积蓄五十斤干菜备荒。最后他十分肯定而有信心的说：“大家努力，人定胜天，我们一定能战胜灾荒，彻底打败蒋介石。”接着清凉翻身农民贺中花上台说：“没有共产党我就没时光，我要靠住共产党这座大山，积极支援反攻，打败蒋介石保卫好时好光！”清凉荣退军人在大会上感谢党和群众对他的照顾。妇女、学生……………都纷纷上台说出自己对党的心爱话。讲话的人拥挤不断，都要急着把自己的话说给恩人——共产党。会场的口号声此起彼落，喊声振动了四野，到会人的两只眼睛，注视着台上说话的人，兴奋得闭不住嘴唇，到黄昏始散会。
