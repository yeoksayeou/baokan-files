(This article transmitted from Ji'nan on the 26th by our newspaper): Qinghe has fully entered the hoeing season, with mutual aid groups saving labor and engaging in sideline production. In Donggaozhuang Mutual Aid Group, District 1, precise labor calculations are being made. Song Hongrong's group, consisting of eight households and ten full laborers, has ninety-six mu of land. Their plan is to save eighty workdays in half a month. After hoeing sixteen mu of land for three households with elderly, weak, orphaned, or widowed members, they can earn 150 jin of wage rice. They still have forty-nine workdays remaining and are currently preparing for sideline production. Liu Changshan's group, consisting of twelve households and sixteen full laborers, has one hundred and thirty mu of land. They can complete three rounds of hoeing in ten days, saving ninety workdays in half a month. Twenty workdays will be used for odd jobs, and the remaining seventy workdays are also being used to develop sideline businesses. After the rain, Chengguan Village in District 3 launched a mutual aid campaign to quickly hoe the seedlings. Most of the land has been hoed three times, and priority was given to the families of soldiers. The militia mutual aid group hoed ten mu and six fen of land in one afternoon. They are now seizing the opportunity to begin watering. Zhang Kuan's seven women's mutual aid groups in District 1 are engaged in both hoeing and spinning. In Feng Suolan's group, three people are spinning cotton, and they have spun ten jin of pure cotton in just ten days, while also hoeing over twenty mu of late seedlings for the first and second rounds. Wang Yueqin's group used large hoes to pull five mu of ridges. The young women's group hoed twenty-six mu of late seedlings. Under the slogan of combining hoeing and sideline production with learning, the primary schools are also working actively. In Baifozhuang Primary School, District 5, the students helped a military family hoe three mu and five fen of sorghum in one morning. Now, every morning, they help families with odd jobs, and in the afternoons, they go to the fields to hoe seedlings. The masses greatly approve of this approach, where they can both study and earn profits by working.

　　清河互助锄苗省工进行副业
    【本报冀南二十六日电】清河全面进入锄苗，互助省工进行副业。一区东高庄互助组精确计算劳力，宋宏荣组八户十个整劳力，九十六亩地，半月计划省工八十个，除给三家老弱孤寡锄十六亩地，能赚一百五十斤工资米，还余四十九个工，正筹备副业生产。刘长山组十二户，十六个整劳力，一百三十亩地，十天能锄完三遍，半月省工九十个，用二十个工做零活，余下的七十个工也在着手经营副业。三区城关村雨后互助突击锄苗，大部锄完三遍，并尽先照顾了抗属，民兵互助组一下午就锄了十亩零六分地，现已抓紧空隙开始了淋灌。一区的张宽七个妇女互助组，一面锄地一面纺织，冯素兰组三人纺花，仅十天工夫就净花十斤，锄晚苗头遍，二遍二十余亩。王月琴组用大锄拉了五亩垄子。闺女组锄了二十六亩晚苗。各小学在锄地搞副业结合学习的口号下，也都积极的工作，五区白佛庄小学生帮助军属一晌锄了三亩五分高粱，现每天早上帮助各家作零活，上下午下地苗锄。群众对又能念书又能作活赚利的作法，很赞成。
