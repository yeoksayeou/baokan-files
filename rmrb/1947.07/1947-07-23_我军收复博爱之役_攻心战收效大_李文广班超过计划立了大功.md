　　Our Army Recovers Bo'ai
  　Offensive Psychological Warfare Proves Effective
  　Li Wenguang's Squad Exceeds Plan, Achieves Great Merit
    [Our Newspaper] Comrade Wang Minzhao reports from the Yubei Front: During the Bo'ai battle, various units universally carried out battlefield appeals, cooperating with military might to launch offensive psychological warfare, which proved very effective. Cui Quanlu's squad combined bravery and ingenuity. While approaching to threaten the enemy with grenades, newly liberated soldier Zhang Xide shouted, "Those who lay down their arms will not be killed! I was also liberated in Qixian, the Eighth Route Army treats prisoners well!" They took eight bunkers in succession, with no casualties in the entire squad. In a large bunker in the southwest corner of the city, two platoons of enemies were gathered, defended by a heavy machine gun and two light machine guns. After our people's soldiers surrounded them, they shouted in unison, "It's no use, surrender your guns, don't die for Chiang Kai-shek…" Yang Fuxi, a newly liberated soldier from the Third Squad, held his gun and shouted, "Hurry up and surrender your guns! Our 49th Brigade has been wiped out, how can you succeed? The Eighth Route Army treats us very well, come over here, I guarantee nothing will happen." Two puppet platoon leaders in the bunker stuck their heads out, holding box cannons and said, "Surrender, surrender, just don't kill me." Fuxi pulled them both out and said, "You quickly call out all the names, I guarantee your safety." The puppet platoon leader shouted, "××, ××, you come out quickly, I've already come out, nothing happened..." Both platoons, wearing their hats askew, crawled out of the bunker with their hands holding guns, respectfully saying, "Surrender, surrender." This kind of example exists in every company, truly creating a mass battlefield appeal, which is one of the three major characteristics of this battle. (Good fighting, fast breakthrough, clean elimination; good discipline, achieving no offense against the people, all materials handed over to the public, battlefield appeals universally playing a role.) This is due to: (1) In-depth mobilization and organizational work were carried out before the battle. During the battle deployment, not only was the enemy's number and equipment scouted militarily, but also the political situation of each enemy unit and its internal contradictions were collected in detail. These materials were communicated and educated to the troops. The battlefield appeal work was emphasized and specifically arranged during the mobilization, and different appeal slogans were formulated for different troops. (2) The enthusiasm and initiative of all commanders and fighters were mobilized, and all commanders, fighters, and political workers were involved in this wave. In particular, the personal accounts of liberated soldiers were even more effective. (3) Military might and offensive psychological warfare were well coordinated and echoed each other, so that the enemy disarmed themselves politically and were under the oppression of our military might, leaving them with only one way to surrender.
    [Our Newspaper] Li Wenguang's Model Squad of the 208th Unit created amazing achievements in the Battle of Bo'ai. Before the Qin and Bo battles, squad leader Li Wenguang, despite being ill, led the entire squad to formulate a merit-making plan: 1. All enemy assets obtained will be handed over to the public; 2. The entire squad will seize eight rifles, one machine gun, and capture eight prisoners; 3. Light injuries will not leave the front line; 4. Do not search prisoners' pockets, do not take a needle or thread from the people; 5. Guarantee that no new sick people will occur; 6. Resolutely and bravely guarantee the completion of all tasks given by the superiors. After the plan was formulated, they also received a challenge from the hero Zhang Xiangshun's squad of the regiment, and the entire squad rose to the challenge. The soldiers all comforted the squad leader: "You are sick and cannot participate in the battle, don't worry, we guarantee not to disgrace our squad." As a result, the heroes of Li Wenguang's squad truly lived up to their name. In the successive capture of three bunkers, his squad always rushed to the front, and they were able to flexibly combine skills and bravery. For example, Gao Lianshan, a soldier who had been liberated for less than two months, bravely rushed to the front. After the artillery suppressed the enemy, he seized the opportunity to shout to the enemy in the bunker. Liu Baogui, a second-class meritorious person, and Zhang Ronggui, a fourth-class meritorious person, led the brave soldiers of the whole squad to charge, quickly climbed the bunker, and forced the enemy to surrender their guns. This time, eight people from their squad participated in the battle, captured sixteen enemies alive, seized one 82mm mortar, one light machine gun, twelve rifles, two thousand rounds of ammunition, and nine shells, all without any casualties. Their platoon also seized one Maxim heavy machine gun, in addition to three Mauser pistols, and captured seventeen enemies. (Yonglin, Han Xinqiu)

　　我军收复博爱之役
  　攻心战收效大
  　李文广班超过计划立了大功
    【本报讯】豫北前线王敏昭同志报导：博爱战斗中，各部队普遍进行了战场喊话，配合军事威力开展攻心战，收效甚大。崔全禄班勇猛与智巧结合，在迫近以手榴弹威胁敌人时，新解放战士张锡德就喊：“缴枪不杀，我也是在淇县解放过来的，八路军优待俘虏！”连下八个碉堡，全班无一伤亡。城西南角一个大碉堡中，集结两排敌人，一挺重机枪、两挺轻机枪固守，我人民战士围拢后一齐喊：“不行了，缴枪吧，不要替蒋介石送命…………”三班新解放战士杨福喜端着枪喊道：“快缴枪吧，我们四十九旅都被消灭了，你们怎么能行？八路军对我们可好哩，过来吧，保证没事情。”地堡里两个伪排长伸出头来，手举着盒子枪说道：“缴枪，缴枪，不杀我就行。”福喜把他两个拉出来说：“你快些点名都叫出来，我保证你们的安全。”伪排长就喊起来：“××，××，你们快出来吧，我已经出来了，一点事也没有…………”两个排都歪戴着帽从地堡里双手举着枪爬出来，恭恭敬敬的说：“缴枪，缴枪。”这种例子每个连队都有，真正造成了群众性的战场喊话，是这次战斗三大特色之一。（打的好，突破快，消灭的干净；纪律好，做到秋毫无犯，物资全部交公，战场喊话普遍起到作用。）这是由于：（一）战前进行了深入的动员与组织工作，在战役布置时，不但军事上侦察敌人的数量及配备，也详细收集了各部敌人的政治情况及其内部矛盾。将这些材料向部队进行传达教育。动员中强调并具体布置了战场喊话工作，对不同部队订出了不同的喊话口号。（二）发动了全体指战员的热情和积极性，所有指挥员、战斗员、政工人员都卷入这一浪潮。特别是解放战士的现身说法，收效更大。（三）军事威力与攻心战很好的密切配合与呼应，使敌解除了政治武装，处于我军事威力的压迫下，只有缴枪投降的一条路。
    【本报讯】二○八部队李文广模范班在博爱战斗中创惊人战绩。在沁、博战役前，班长李文广即扶病号领全班订出立功计划：一、获得敌人资财全部交公；二、全班缴步枪八支、机枪一挺，俘虏八名；三、轻彩不下火线；四、不搜俘虏腰包，不拿老百姓一针一线；五、保证不发生新病号；六、坚决勇敢保证完成上级给的一切任务。计划订出后，又接到该团英雄张祥顺班的挑战书，全班奋起应战。战士们都安慰班长：“你病了不能参加战斗，不要着急，我们保证不能给咱们班丢人。”结果李文广班诸英雄果真名不虚传，在连克三座碉堡中，他班总是冲在最前面，而且他们能灵活的把技巧与勇敢结合，如才解放不到两月的战士高连山，就奋勇冲到最前面在炮火把敌压倒后，抓住时机向碉堡敌人喊话。他班二等功臣刘保贵、四等功臣张荣贵，带领全班英勇战士冲锋，迅速登上碉堡，迫使敌人缴了枪。这次他们班八个人参加战斗，生俘了十六个敌人，缴获八二迫击炮一门，轻机枪一挺，步枪十二支，子弹两千发，炮弹九发，全部毫无伤亡。他们排这次还缴获了马克沁重机枪一挺，此外并有驳壳枪三支，俘敌十七名。（永林、韩新秋）
