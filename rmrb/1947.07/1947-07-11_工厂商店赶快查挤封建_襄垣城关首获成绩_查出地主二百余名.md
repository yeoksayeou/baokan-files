    Factories and Shops Quickly Investigate and Squeeze Out Feudal Elements
    Xiangyuan Chengguan Scores Initial Success
    Unearthing Over Two Hundred Landlords
    [This newspaper's Xiangyuan dispatch] The factories in Xiangyuan Chengguan are investigating landlords' "air-raid shelters," squeezing out more than two hundred despots and bullies like Zhao Jinshan. Zhao Jinshan, a despotic bully in the Chengguan Yuhua Straw Hat Factory, was originally the deputy manager of the factory. He was a local tyrant resented by the peasants. He possessed excellent techniques for making straw hat needles, but he consistently hoarded his techniques, acted like a veteran, and oppressed the workers. Initially, the leadership had paralyzing thoughts, believing that toppling Zhao Jinshan would affect production. This not only made the peasants dissatisfied with the factory, feeling that feudal remnants were being left behind, but also made the workers dare to be angry but not speak out. It was during this production inspection that Zhao Jinshan's sabotage activities were discovered, severely hindering production. Only then was the masses' demand for struggle approved, and a speak-bitterness meeting was launched to struggle against Zhao Jinshan. The accusations revealed Zhao's activities: he incited workers to strike, attempting to overthrow the trade union cadres; he colluded with backward workers, plotting to attack the Chengguan political director and retired soldiers; he secretly had his wife spread rumors, saying there were corrupt relationships within the factory, thereby undermining the prestige of cadres and activists; he deliberately made faulty needles, intentionally saying the workers were being disruptive, creating disunity and forming labor-management antagonism. Some workers wept bitterly as they recounted his oppression. Under the pressure of the masses, Zhao was forced to admit that he was a landlord bully and a Chiang Kai-shek secret agent who had been hiding for three years. During the struggle against Zhao, all the workers poured out their grievances and vented their anger. Finally, Zhao was dismissed on the spot, and the workers unanimously agreed to send him back to his village to be dealt with by the peasants, greatly exciting the peasants in the village and promoting the unity of workers and peasants.
    Since then, it has aroused the vigilance of all sectors in Chengguan, with each examining for hidden landlords. The union of staff and workers strictly examines its members, resolutely preventing the factory from becoming a landlord's air-raid shelter. As a result of the investigation, more than two hundred landlords were found hiding in government production departments, factories, and shops, and more than thirty had infiltrated workers' organizations. Immediately, clear class boundaries were drawn, and all departments simultaneously launched speak-bitterness sessions. The shop assistant of × shop cried out pitifully about being severely reprimanded by the landlord manager for taking the wrong chamber pot. It was also discovered that most of the landlords served as managers and accountants, still ruling over others. If they were not served properly, they would immediately oppress the shop assistants and workers. At this time, the government publicly announced that shop assistants and workers would not serve any landlords who were objects of struggle. Those guilty of the most heinous crimes were struggled against by the workers and then sent back to their villages.
    Since toppling these despots and bullies, the workers have had another stone slab removed from their backs, so they have increased their production enthusiasm. For example, Li Chenglu of the Yuhua Straw Hat Factory increased his production from forty straw hats to seventy, and Comrade Li Junsheng once made ninety-three hats, exceeding his previous output by fifty-three. The factory increased its straw hat production by one thousand and fifty in June. (Bingying)

    工厂商店赶快查挤封建
    襄垣城关首获成绩
    查出地主二百余名
    【本报襄垣讯】襄垣城关各工厂，清查地主“防空洞”，挤出奸霸赵进山等二百余名。城关裕华草帽厂奸霸赵进山，在本厂原为副经理，是一个农民所愤恨的恶霸，他有着制做草帽针的优良技术，但在厂内一贯保守他的技术，摆老资格，压迫工人。领导上起初有麻痹思想，认为斗垮赵进山生产就要受影响，这样不但农民对工厂不满，觉得给封建留下了尾巴，工人也是敢怒不敢言。在此次生产大检查中，才发现赵进山的破坏活动，严重的阻碍着生产，这时才批准群众的斗争要求，展开诉苦大会，向赵进山斗争。诉苦中揭露了赵的活动事实：他发动工人罢工，企图打垮工会干部。拉拢落后工人，谋想打击城关政治主任与荣退军人。暗地叫他女人造谣，说厂内有腐化关系，依此打垮干部与积极分子的威信。专门做下坏针，故意说工人捣蛋，弄的互不团结，形成劳资对立。有的工人在说起受着他的压迫时，痛哭流涕。赵逆在群众的压力下，不得不承认自己是一个地主恶霸，而且是一个隐藏三年的蒋特。斗赵时全体工人都倒尽了苦水，出尽了气，最后又当场将赵罢免，工人一致愿意送回他本村由农民处理，大大兴奋了该村农民，并促成了工农的团结。
    自此以后，引起了全城关各界的警惕，各自检查隐藏地主，职工会严格审查会员，坚决不让工厂成为地主的防空洞。检查的结果，有二百余个地主隐蔽于机关生产部门和工厂及商店中，混入工人组织内的有三十余个。当即明确划分阶级界线，各部门同时发动诉苦。×商店店员哭诉因拿错尿壶被地主经理训斥的非常可怜。更发现大半地主担任经理与会计，仍旧居之于别人头上，侍候不对马下即来欺压店员及工人。这时政府公开宣布，凡地主斗争对象，店员工人一律不侍候。罪大恶极者，均由工人斗罢送回村内。
    自斗垮这些奸霸以后，工人身上又揭去了一块石板，所以提高了生产情绪。如裕华草帽厂李成六由四十顶草帽增做至七十顶，李俊盛同志曾做到九十三顶，超过以前五十三顶。全厂六月份增产草帽一千零五十顶。（秉英）
