　　Three Hundred Thousand People Oppose Chiang Kai-shek by Repairing Dikes and Blocking the Yellow River
    Wang Yaping
    "Ensure the safety of the Yellow River banks, defend the Jin Dike, prevent breaches, and smash Chiang's Yellow River offensive!" Under this urgent call, the Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Hebei-South regions mobilized 300,000 people to repair dikes and block the Yellow River in less than half a month.
    The emancipated people accepted this great project bravely and joyfully. The ramming workers around Zhangqiu bought iron wire and twisted hemp rope, and in one day and one night, they bound four thousand stone rammers. More than 30,000 laborers from the Hebei-South region, pushing firewood, carrying grain, shouldering iron shovels and hoes, and carrying large carrying baskets on their backs, formed a line dozens of miles long under the scorching sun of May, heading towards the Yellow River dike.
    Wherever the dike-repairing ranks passed, villages welcomed them and everyone was excited. Sisters' groups helped them boil water and cook rice, and village cadres helped them chop firewood and carry water. As they marched, they sang: "Chiang Kai-shek, shameless, releasing the Yellow River to flood us!" When they approached the Yellow River, tens of thousands of brothers were already gathered there, enthusiastically welcoming this dike-repairing contingent that had come from afar.
    "Complete emancipation requires solid dike building!" "Build dikes and repair embankments to protect our rice bowls!" At the mobilization meeting, the people's shouts shook heaven and earth. The organization of the dike-repairing laborers was as tight as steel. The number of people mobilized from each village, district, and county was organized into classes, squads, and brigades. Each class, squad, and brigade was to elect models from their work. The dike-repairing engineering office prepared more than twenty brocade banners, embroidered with glorious phrases in gold and red, such as "Awe-Inspiring Yellow River," "Ten Thousand Li Barrier," "Merit Greater Than Yu the Great," "Ramming Worker Heroes," "Consolidate the Defenses," and "Yellow River Screen." In addition, large red silk cloths were prepared for the ramming workers. Whoever rammed well and solidly would have their ramming rope "hung with red."
    On the morning of May 15th, cannons were fired and firecrackers were set off, and construction began. The laborers dug earth and carried baskets according to the designated locations. They said with a smile, "Comrades! Defeat Old Chiang! We must also defeat Old Yellow! (Yellow River water)" The ramming workers were on the south side of the dike, and the earthworkers were on the north side. From Changyuan in the west to Qiyu in the east, six hundred thousand strong arms waved along the five-hundred-mile-long river dike. Digging earth, carrying baskets, ramming. The sounds of yelling, laughter, singing, and the sound of hoes hitting stones rose and fell, continuously merging into a magnificent and great symphony.
    Chiang Kai-shek's American-style planes came to bomb. In an instant, the laborers all drilled into the air-raid shelters dug in advance. The sky was quiet, the ground was quiet, the planes were flying around overhead, buzzing, dropping bombs, and firing machine guns. A laborer in his forties, with his head tilted and his teeth clenched, was so angry that his face turned red and the veins on his forehead bulged. He pointed at the plane and cursed: "Fuck your mother, Old Chiang!" The hearts of hundreds of thousands of laborers lying in the air-raid shelters heavily and angrily remembered the hatred sown by the sinful Chiang planes.
    The Chiang planes flew away, and they quickly crawled out to work: the earth was dug faster, the ramming was more cheerful, the cadres ran back and forth to supervise the project, and the county magistrate, the section chiefs and directors of the engineering office also followed suit, digging and pushing earth. The blazing sun shone on the yellow earth on the dike, on the green and yellow wheat fields, and on the laborers' bare arms.
    You ram the earth,
    I carry the soil.
    The ramming must be level,
    The soil must be dug deep,
    Block the Yellow River water from harming people,
    And defeat Chiang the Bald!
    The ramming workers with red silk hanging from their ropes sang the "Anti-Chiang Dike-Building Ballad" loudly, and the earthworkers cheerfully echoed. Each rammer had eight people, and eight red silk cloths were tied to eight ropes, raised and dropped together. Ramming up and down, singing one sentence after another, the sun smiled, the birds chirped, the insects chirped, everyone smiled in their hearts, sweat flowed from their backs, arms, and faces, and in their joyful work, they only remembered to exert strength with their hands and sing ditties, forgetting their fatigue.
    During the work break, the propaganda team of the Folk Art Department of the Literary Federation, and dozens of teachers and students from local elementary schools, sang songs, performed short plays, showed shadow plays, played the dulcimer, and sang "Zhui Zi" ballads for them. Those intimate voices, exciting voices, inspired and comforted them. Everyone laughed and sang together:
    We are of one heart,
    We are one family,
    Build the golden dike like the Great Wall,
    Don't be afraid of Old Chiang releasing water to flood people!
    "Start work early, finish work late." They automatically and unanimously shouted such slogans, eating and going to work before dawn; not stopping work until the sun went down. They were scheduled to dig two cubic meters of earth per person per day, but most of them dug four cubic meters of earth, and some even exceeded four cubic meters. As work enthusiasm gradually increased, villages and small areas issued challenges to each other, launching fierce competitions. Here they shouted: "We want to build better than you!" There they shouted: "We want to ram faster than you!" Under such mutual competition, they were able to complete the project ahead of schedule. For example, the laborers of Wulipu in the Second District, in the general mobilization and competition, completed the nine-day project in less than three days.
    "Men on the dike, women at home weeding and inspecting the fields." In order to cooperate with the dike repair, the women of Fan County voluntarily formed model classes to weed and intensify production. They also wrote letters to the dike to express their concern. When the dike-repairing laborers received such enthusiastic letters, their work became more energetic, working for twelve to fourteen hours a day without wanting to get off work.
    In order to complete the dangerous work and rush to block the river dike, the people of Dong'a launched a stone donation campaign. A meeting was held, and after some discussion, everyone scrambled to donate. Some donated stones for building houses, some donated stone slabs, and some donated memorial archways. An old farmer who had been emancipated, divided the land, and divided the house happily donated five large carts of stones. He said: "I have been emancipated and don't worry about food and clothing, but I am afraid of the Yellow River water!"
    "Human power can overcome nature." The Jin Dike and Lin Yellow River Dike became alive, and the world here also became more beautiful. The people of the great liberated areas fully demonstrated the power of organized victory over everything in this dike repair and river blocking project. Along the river dike, comrades from the propaganda brigade recorded the merits of the earthworkers and ramming workers in each section on dozens of blackboards every day. The "Dike Repairing Newspaper" of the engineering office even more richly collected all the dike repairing materials and reported in detail and vividly to each dike repairing section.
    Wang Daoli, a seventy-year-old ramming worker, led four thousand ramming workers, and he could sing more than a dozen tunes for ramming workers. He walked around, looked around, and shouted to everyone:
    The soil must be spread evenly,
    The ramming must be strong,
    Finish the work early,
    To go home and cut wheat,
    To defeat Old Chiang that rascal.
    Sometimes, seeing that a rammer was not hitting evenly, he would teach them how to hit, and sing various "bugle" and "horn" tunes. What "Big girl making shoes," "Young son-in-law wetting the bed," he sang with great relish and humor, and the laborers' hands and hearts were filled with strength.
    "Old Chiang wants to flood us, we will build the dike like iron!" Three hundred thousand people, with one heart and one mind, wanted to smash Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy of "releasing the Yellow River water to resist four hundred thousand troops!" They were determined to make this five-hundred-mile-long dike stand on the plain and become a steel barrier, to govern the Yellow River, which is like a beast and harms the people as much as Chiang Kai-shek, so that it is tame and submissive.

　　三十万人反蒋修堤堵黄河
    王亚平
    “确保临黄，固守金堤，不使决口，粉碎蒋黄进攻!”在这样急切的号召下，冀鲁豫区和冀南区，不上半月的工夫，就动员了三十万人到黄河边去修堤堵河。
    翻了身的人民，对于这个伟大的工程，是勇敢而欢喜地接受了。张秋一带的硪工，买铁丝，搓麻绳，一天一夜的时间，就绑成了四千架石硪。冀南区的三万多民工，推着柴火，挑着粮食，扛着铁锹，钁头，背着大抬筐，在五月炎炎似火烧的太阳底下，排成几十里长的行列，走向黄河大堤。
    修堤行列走过的地方，村村欢迎，人人兴奋，姊妹团帮他们烧水煮饭，村干帮他们劈柴挑水。他们一面走，一面唱着：“蒋介石，不要脸，放了黄水来淹咱！”当他们走近黄河边的时候，那里早集合了几万个弟兄，在狂奋地迎接这远道走来的修堤大队。
    “翻身要彻底，打堤要结实！”“打堤修埝，保住饭碗！”动员大会上，群众的呼声，把天地河山都震动了。修堤民工的组织，象钢铁一样的严密，按村、区、县动员来的人数编成了班、小队、大队。各班、队、大队要从工作进行中选举模范。修堤工程处准备了二十几面锦旗，上面绣着，“威震黄河”、“万里屏风”、“功高大禹”、“硪工英雄”、“巩固堤防”、“黄水屏藩”等金色红色的辉煌词句。另外，给硪工准备了大红绸子，谁打的好，打的牢，就给硪绳上“挂红”。
    五月十五号的早晨，鸣了炮，拉了鞭爆，动工了。民工们，各自按着指定的地点挖土抬筐，他们笑着说：“伙计们！打败老蒋！还得打败老黄！（黄水）”硪工在堤南，土工在堤北，西起长垣，东达齐禹，五百里长的河堤上，六十万只粗壮的手臂挥动了。挖土、抬筐、打硪。吆呵的声音、欢笑的声音，唱歌的声音，钁头碰到石头的声音，一起一落，连接不断地，汇成了一个雄壮伟大的交响乐。
    老蒋的美式飞机来轰炸了，刹那间，民工们都钻进预先掘好的防空沟里，天上静了，地下静了，飞机在头顶上乱云，（飞的意思）乱嗡嗡，乱投弹，乱打机枪，一个四十多岁的民工，斜着头，咬着牙，气得脸发红了，额头上爆起青筋，指着飞机骂：“肏你娘，老蒋！”伏在防空沟里的几十万民工的心里，都沉重地，愤怒地记住了这个罪恶的蒋机给种下的仇恨。
    蒋机飞走了，他们迅速地爬出来工作：土挖的更快，硪打的更欢，干部跑来跑去的催督工程，县长，工程处的科长、处长也跟着挖土，推土。火辣辣的太阳，晒着堤上的黄土，晒着青黄的麦田，晒着民工赤裸的臂膀。
    你打硪呀，
    我抬土。
    硪要打得平，
    土要掘得深，
    堵住了黄水不害人，
    还要打败蒋二秃！
    挂了红的硪工，高声唱着“反蒋打堤小调”，土工们欢快地应和着。每架硪八个人，八条绳上拴起八条红绸子，一同甩上去，一同打下来。一上一下的打，一声一句的唱，太阳笑了，小鸟叫了，虫子叫了，人人心里笑了，脊梁上，手臂上，脸上的汗水流出了，他们在欢狂的工作里，只记得手上用劲，嘴里唱小调，却忘记了疲倦。
    歇工吃饭的时候，有文联民间艺术部的艺人宣传队，和当地的几十个小学的教员，男女学生，给他们唱歌，演小戏，拉洋片，打洋琴，唱坠子。那些亲热的声音，激奋的声音，鼓舞了他们，安慰了他们。大家一齐笑着，唱着：
    咱们一条心，
    咱们是一家人，
    打成金堤象长城，
    不怕老蒋放水来淹人！
    “上工早，下工晚。”他们自动的一致的喊出了这样的口号，天不亮，就吃饭上工；太阳落了，还不收工。预定每天一个人掘二方土，他们大都掘到了四方土，有的还超过了四方。在工作热情逐渐提高中，他们村和村，小区和小区，都下了挑战书，发起狂烈的竞赛。这里喊着：“咱要比你修的好！”那里叫着：“俺要比你打得快！”这样互相竞赛下，都能提前完成了工程。象二区五里堡的民工，在总动员的大竞赛中，九天的工程不到三天就修成了。
    “男人上堤，女人在家拔苗，查田。”范县的妇女为了配合修堤，自动地成立模范班，下地拔苗，加紧生产。还写信到堤上慰问，修堤民工接到这样热情的信，工作更加油，更带劲，一天做十二小时到十四小时还不愿下班呢。
    为了完成险工，抢堵河堤，东阿一带的老百姓，发动了献石运动。开了大会，经过一番酝让，大家都争着献出了。有的献出了盖屋的石头，有的献出了石板，有的把节孝石碑都献出了。一个翻了身，分了地，分了房子的老农民欢喜地献出了五大车石头，他说：“俺翻了身，不愁吃穿，就怕黄水！”
    “人力可以胜天”，金堤和临黄堤变成活的了，这里的天地也变美了。伟大的解放区的人民，在这次修堤堵河的工程中，充分地表现出有组织的战胜一切的力量。沿着河堤，有宣传大队的同志，每天在几十个黑板上，记上了各段的土工、硪工的功绩。工程处的“修堤报”上，更丰富地收集了所有修堤材料，向各修堤区段作着详细而生动的报导。
    七十岁的老硪工王道力，领导了四千架硪工，他能唱十几种硪工的调子。他这里走走，那里看看，向大家喊着：
    土要铺的平，
    硪要打的硬，
    早点完了工，
    才能回家割麦子，
    才能打垮老蒋那个孬种。
    有时候，看见那一架硪打的不平，他就下手教他们打，还唱着各种“小号”“大号”的调子。什么“大闺女做鞋”，“小女婿尿床”，他唱的很有味，很好笑，民工们的手上、心里也就增大了力气。
    “老蒋想淹咱，咱就把堤打成铁一般！”三十万人一条心，一股劲，要粉碎蒋介石“放黄水，要抵得住四十万大军！”的阴谋，他们决心要使这东西长达五百里的大堤，屹立在平原上变成钢铁似的屏藩。要使这个恶兽似的，和蒋介石同样祸害人民的黄水治理得驯驯服服的。
