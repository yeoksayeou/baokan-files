　　Taihang Second District Workers in Various Industries
 　 Thoroughly Investigate and Expel Feudal Elements
    [Our Taihang News] The movement to investigate and expel feudal elements among workers in various industries in the Second District of Taihang has now reached a climax. The slogan "Guarantee that not a single dirty element remains in the factory" is widespread. In the process of clarifying class lines at the Fengmin Factory in Yushe, it was discovered that the landlord An Jianying attempted to escape rural struggles by joining the factory as a clerk this spring. Upon arrival, he put on a false show of enthusiasm to paralyze and deceive the comrades in the factory. He was once publicly recognized as a model worker and received an award from the workers' congress. In this way, he treated the factory as his "air-raid shelter." Seeing that others were not paying much attention to him, he took the opportunity to secretly bury silk clothes and other assets from his home in the factory. From then on, the beastly An Jianying gradually grew bolder and became active in the factory. When we proposed thrift, he deliberately tried to sabotage it, mixing kerosene into the millet, making it inedible. At the time, everyone thought it was an unintentional mistake. On another occasion, he poured a lot of water into the oil, making it unusable for lamps or cooking. He secretly ate good food every night and colluded with the accountant to embezzle more than 35,000 silver dollars. During this movement, An's aforementioned facts were revealed by the masses, and the leadership allowed the masses to thoroughly struggle against him and supported them in doing so. An confessed in front of the masses that he was in charge of assassination for Chiang's secret service. He was immediately handed back to the village along with his belongings. The peasants said during the struggle: "If the workers hadn't helped us, we wouldn't have known that this guy was hiding so much stuff." The Workers' Union Branch in Yunzu Town, Yushe, conducted a thorough reorganization of the organization in early July, strictly reviewed members, and launched a mass-based clean-up, expelling two landlord members. Now the review of the entire branch union has come to an end, and the re-examination and general election of worker cadres are underway. The workers excitedly said: "Today, it is a great honor for us to be a member of the trade union." The Heshun Nitre Workshop did not pay attention to who it hired, allowing many landlords who had been overthrown to take the opportunity to infiltrate. Since then, these guys have used the power of the nitre workshop to oppress the masses, especially when scraping earth, they deliberately scraped near the houses of the masses, causing the main reason for the disunity between workers and peasants. After the problem was discovered, the result of the review was that eleven landlords were making trouble. All were removed, and the work took on a new look. The Wenhua Printing Factory of the Taihang Second Special District has also now proposed to ensure that not a single dirty element remains in the factory and to thoroughly investigate and expel feudal elements.

　　太行二分区各业职工
  　彻底查挤封建
    【本报太行讯】太行二分区各业职工的查挤封建运动，现已进入高潮，“保证厂内不留一点肮脏”的口号，普遍各地。榆社丰民工厂在划清阶级界线中，发现地主安建英企图逃避农村斗争，于今春加入工厂当了事务长，初来装了一套假积极，来麻痹与蒙蔽全厂同志，有一次曾被大家公认为模范工作者，受到职工大会的奖励。这样他就把工厂作为他的“防空洞”了，他看见别人对他很不注意，于是趁机将家内的绸缎衣服等资财暗地拿来埋藏在工厂。从此人面兽心的安健英慢慢的放大了胆子，在工厂内活动了起来。当我们提出节约时他专意要破坏，把小米内掺上了煤油，米不能吃了，这时大家还以为他是无心的错误。又一次又把油里边倒了很多水，油便不能点灯也无法炒菜了。每天黑夜偷吃好饭，并与会计合伙贪污大洋三万五千余元，在此次的运动中，安逆的上述事实才由群众揭露了出来，领导上允许群众彻底斗争，并给撑腰做主。安逆在群众面前自供为蒋特暗杀负责人，当即连人带物交回村内。农民在斗争中说：“不是工人帮助咱们可不知道这家伙还埋藏着这样多的东西。”榆社云簇镇职工联合支部，于七月上旬进行细密的整顿组织，严格的审查会员，开展了群众性的大清查，开除两个地主会员。现在全支联的审查已告一段落，正进行复查与普选职工干部等工作。工人们兴奋的说：“今天我们当一个工会会员是非常光荣的。”和顺硝坊因收留工人不注意，使很多被斗垮的地主趁机钻了进来，自此以后，这些家伙即借用硝坊之势，欺压群众，特别在刮土时专门在群众房屋跟前胡刮，造成了工农不团结的主要原因。问题发现以后，审查的结果，有地主十一个在作怪，一律清除出去，工作才有了新的起色。太行二专区文华印刷厂现也提出保证厂内不留一点肮脏，彻底查挤封建。（赵秉英）
