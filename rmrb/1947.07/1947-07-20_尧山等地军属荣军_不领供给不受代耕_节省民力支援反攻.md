[This report from our newspaper in Southern Hebei on the 18th] Military families and honored servicemen in various places are saving civilian labor and supporting the counter-offensive by refusing replacement farming and supplies. Li Luoyu, a military dependent in Xihe Village, Yaoshan, has relied on short-term labor for many years. After the land reform, he was allocated a piece of land, which he cultivated carefully, never asking the replacement farming team for labor. When the team leader wanted to provide replacement farming for him, he said, "Cultivate for others; this is nothing for me." After the replacement farming tickets were issued, the masses held a meeting to discuss their implementation. Li Luoyu was the first to say, "Although I am over fifty years old, I am not yet ready to admit that I am old. Moreover, joining the army is not to fight the enemy for others! I was able to farm when I was a hired worker, so now that I have my own land, can't I farm it? Wait until I am too old to move, then give me replacement farming!" He Zudang, an honored serviceman in Nanwangdian, was seriously wounded multiple times during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Since returning home, he has never received any supplies. He said, "I cannot go to the front to kill the enemy, and I always feel bad about it. Now that I am not starving, not receiving supplies, saving more food to supply to the front lines will help defeat Chiang Kai-shek sooner." When the masses offered to do replacement farming for him, he said, "I can still work, and I cannot rely on others to enjoy happiness. I want to cultivate and eat my own food, saving civilian labor." Fu Luoshun, an old military dependent in Beida Village, Second District of Baixiang, has a family of six and cultivates twenty mu of land. He has neither a waterwheel nor livestock. He uses his own labor to exchange labor with others' livestock. During the rush harvesting and planting campaign, he joined a mutual aid group. Not only did he cultivate his own land well, but he also helped others pull waterwheels, his eyes bloodshot, but he refused to rest for even half a moment. When the women's association's noodle-making team wanted to make noodles for him, he refused, saying, "I don't even want the masses to do replacement farming for my land. My family can make their own noodles. You should quickly go and pull waterwheels for others and irrigate more land and plant more seedlings!"

    尧山等地军属荣军
    不领供给不受代耕
    节省民力支援反攻
    【本报冀南十八日电】各地军属荣誉军人节省民力，支援反攻，不受代耕，不领供给。尧山西河村抗属李洛玉多年靠当长短工为生，土地改革后，分了一部分土地，即细心耕种，不往代耕组要工，组长要给他代耕时，他就说：“种别人的吧，我这不算回事”。代耕票发下后，群众开会讨论执行，洛玉首先说道：“我虽五十多岁，但还不服老，况且参军也不是给别人打敌人！从前当雇工能种地，现在自己有了地，倒不能种了吗？等我老的不能动了，再给我代耕吧！”南汪店荣誉军人何组唐抗战中身负重伤多次，自回到家来，全部供给一次未领。他说：“我不能上前方杀敌，心里总觉着过不去，现在我又不挨饥，不领供给，多节省点粮食，供给前线，就能早日打败蒋介石。”群众给他代耕时，他又说：“我还能劳动，不能依靠别人坐享幸福，我要自耕自食节省民力。”柏乡二区北大村老军属傅洛顺，全家六口人，种地二十亩，既没水车，也没牲口，他用自己劳力与别人牲口换工。抢收抢种运动中，他参加了互助组，不但把自己的地种好，并给别人拉水车，两眼熬的血红，也不肯休息半晌。妇女会推面组要给他推面，他拒绝说：“我地里活还不叫群众代耕，家里吃点面，自己老少就推了，你们快去给别人推水车，多浇点地多按些苗吧！”
