Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Lu-Yu Frontline, 14th. Frontline reporter Tang Ximin reports: The enthusiasm of the people on the north bank of the Yellow River in welcoming and seeing off the army marching south has greatly boosted the morale of the troops. A certain unit that achieved victory in the Yuncheng battle marched hundreds of miles from the Wei River bank to the Yellow River bank. Every time they passed a village, men, women, and children lined the streets to welcome and see them off. In villages in Qingfeng, Fanxian, Shouzhang, Zhangqiu, and other places, hot water was prepared one or two days before the troops arrived and stored in jars. As soon as the troops arrived, the loudspeaker of the broadcasting station immediately announced: "The troops have arrived, everyone quickly bring the hot water to the street!" Some villages, even though the troops did not pass through them, carried hot water to the main road. Some villages, because the troops would not pass through until the second half of the night, sat patiently at their doors waiting. Even at four o'clock in the morning, the soldiers could still drink hot water everywhere. The women's associations and children's sister groups in villages such as Guanchengzhuang lined up neatly along the road, beating gongs and drums and singing Yangge songs to welcome the Liberation Army. The villages in Qingfeng and Shouzhang counties all found guides in advance, led by village cadres, waiting by the side of the village to lead the way at any time. The masses in Shouzhang and Zhangqiu counties cleaned the houses that had been vacated in advance. Where there were few houses, the people preferred to move to the woods to sleep. As soon as the troops entered the houses, the women busied themselves with boiling water, asking the soldiers to drink, wash their faces, and wash their feet, and helping with cooking and washing clothes. Folk artists from a certain unit in the second district of Shouzhang organized a comfort performance for the soldiers, singing drum ballad, high-pitched tunes, and Hebei Bangzi opera. The masses in various districts of Shouzhang also prepared a large number of comfort items to send to the troops and sent representatives and Yangge teams, braving the sweltering heat, to run dozens of miles to offer their condolences. Therefore, before entering the battle, the soldiers said one after another: "We must fight well, otherwise we will let down the people." Finally, as soon as they crossed the river, they annihilated two enemy brigades and captured Yuncheng in one fell swoop.

    反攻大军南下途中各地群众狂欢迎送
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线十四日电】前线记者唐西民报导：黄河北岸人民欢送南渡大军的热情，大大鼓舞了部队的士气；取得郓城大捷之某部从卫河岸到黄河边，在数百里的行军途上，每过一村，男女老幼均夹道迎送。在清丰、范县、寿张、张秋等地村庄，部队未到之前一两天就准备好了开水，贮在缸里，部队一到，广播台的号筒马上就传出来：“部队已经来了，各家快把开水抬到街上来！”有的村子因部队并不路过，就把开水挑到大路上去；有的村子因为部队下半夜才能路过，老百姓就坐在门口耐心的等候。虽然在清晨四时，战士们依然到处可以喝到开水。观城庄户等村的妇女会、儿童姐妹团，整齐的列队站在大路旁，敲着锣鼓，唱着秧歌，欢迎解放军。清丰和寿张两县的村庄，都预先找好了向导，由村干部带着在村边等候，随时带路。寿张和张秋两县的群众将预先腾好的房子打扫得干干净净，房子少的地方，老百姓宁可自己搬到树林底下去睡。部队一进房子，妇女们就忙着烧水，叫战士解喝、洗脸、洗脚，并帮忙做饭、洗衣服。寿张二区某部集训的民间艺人，组织了慰劳晚会，给战士们清唱坠子、高调和河北梆子。寿张各区群众还准备了大批慰劳品送给部队，并派了代表和秧歌队冒着溽暑跑了几十里路赶来慰问。因此部队进入战斗前，战士们纷纷表示：“一定要打好，否则对不住老百姓。”终于一过河就一举歼敌两个旅，攻克郓城。
