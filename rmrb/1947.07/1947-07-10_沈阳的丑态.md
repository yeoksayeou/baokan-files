Xinhua News Agency, Liaodong, 8th. In the face of the Democratic Allied Forces' thunderous summer offensive, the Chiang Kai-shek officials living in Shenyang were utterly panicked. In the scorching sun, fat-headed and big-eared officials who had made fortunes, and gorgeously dressed wives and young ladies, jostled each other along their huge and conspicuous slogan "Heads can be broken, blood can flow, but the Northeast cannot be lost", rushing to the train to escape to Guan Nei (inside the Pass). The Chiang Kai-shek Central Trust Bureau's Shenyang office took the lead, chartering a ship in Yingkou, preparing for a complete retreat; the Bank of Communications issued each employee 100,000 yuan in travel expenses in "circulation coupons" for sending dependents. The money squeezed from the common people by corrupt officials, profiteers, and warlords also poured into Guan Nei, because they were rushing to exchange "circulation coupons" for "legal tender". The exchange rate between "circulation coupons" and "legal tender" plummeted from one yuan for thirteen yuan to only nine yuan two. The entire Shenyang fell into a state of alarm. Some people complained a lot. On June 9th, Li Zao Chen, a "Senator" of the Chiang Kai-shek Shenyang City Council, shouted at the city council meeting: "The current panic is entirely caused by those who cherish wealth and are afraid of death." Another "Senator," Gao Aiqun, proposed: "Please the military authorities issue an order to prohibit the families from going to Peiping, Tianjin, and Shanghai." But what's the use? Those who are fleeing in alarm are still fleeing in alarm. But one thing is certain, the Northeast of the Northeast people will absolutely not be lost!

　　沈阳的丑态
    【新华社辽东八日电】在民主联军雷霆万钧的夏季攻势前面，住在沈阳的蒋家官儿们，直慌得屁滚屎流。在灼热的阳光中，肥头大耳发足了财的官员，花枝招展的太太小姐，沿着他们那巨幅醒目的“头可断，血可流，东北不可丢”的标语旁，摩肩接踵，赶上火车向关内逃跑。蒋记中央信托局沈阳办事处捷足先登，在营口包好一只轮船，准备全体撤退；交通银行对遣送眷属，职员每人发旅费流通券十万元。贪官、污吏、军阀从老百姓身上榨来的金钱，也汹涌地流入关内，因为抢着拿“流通券”换“法币”，“流通券”与“法币”的比价从一元换十三元，急泻直下，跌到只换九元二。整个沈阳陷入风鹤频惊中。有些人就大发牢骚。六月九日蒋记沈阳市“参议员”李藻臣在市参会上喊道：“目前人心惶惶，全系好财惜命者所造成。”另一位“参议员”高爱群提出：“请军事当局明令查禁去平津沪各眷属。”但是这有什么用，惊逃的还是在惊逃。但有一点是肯定的，东北人民的东北，是绝对不会丢的！
