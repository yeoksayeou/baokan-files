    The Banner of the People's Struggle in Huxi
    Li Rutai's Armed Work Team
    [This newspaper's telegram from the Jilu豫 area on the 7th] The Huxi Li Rutai Armed Work Team began organizing in September of last year. At that time, the situation in Huxi was unstable and the enemy was fierce. The armed work team had only forty-odd people, led by Comrade Li Rutai. Along the Shan (County) - Jie (Mountain) highway on both sides of the Chiang Kai-shek army's rear, they openly suppressed landlords and special agents, supporting the masses. After a month of persistent struggle, they were ordered to move to the Junan area for rest and reorganization. In October of last year, the sub-district decided to send the Li Rutai Armed Work Team to Huxi. They set off on November 13th, walking at night and sleeping during the day, not seeing the sun for ten days. One day, they arrived at Xusi Market in Shanxibei without any food. Comrades Li and Wang were sent to the market to buy food. At that time, personnel from the puppet county government were holding a meeting of puppet township chiefs and Bao chiefs, enjoying a lavish banquet. They boldly barged in, one at the door, and two rushing into the house, brandishing their pistols, overturning the banquet table. The puppet government personnel ran around in panic. They chased after them, charging and shouting, creating chaos. A section chief from the puppet county government ran out of the village and was captured alive by Comrade Li Rutai. The puppet officials did not even know what was happening. After arriving in Huxi, they fought and propagandized at the same time. The content of the propaganda was based on materials immediately visible to the masses, with specific investigation of the time, place, and names. Sometimes they created folk songs, posting and writing them everywhere, without resting all night. Sometimes, in the middle of the night, they would go to the tall houses in each village and shout, "Everyone please sit up and listen to the news." After briefly and powerfully explaining a point, they would leave. The next day, the news of the Eighth Route Army would spread simultaneously throughout twenty or thirty villages, and the morale of the masses would rise again. While going to the market, the Li Rutai Armed Work Team would suddenly appear in the market. The members were distributed everywhere, simultaneously launching propaganda, simple and concise. After speaking, they would leave. This propaganda was very effective, stabilizing prices and increasing the credibility of the Lu currency. In six months, they propagandized to 200,000 people. The Li Rutai Armed Work Team also carried out anti-special agent work. Whenever they arrived in a village, they would order landlords, Bao chiefs, and puppet officials to register, recording details of relatives and property, and ordering them to gather together and swear an oath to the masses, seeking joint guarantors, and allowing the masses to inform on them. The very bad ones were arrested and immediately suppressed. At the same time, they led the masses to counter-sue traitors and settle scores, reversing the assessment of land and grain, launching a land reform movement in forty-odd villages including Tianzhuang. More than one qing of land was returned, more than 67,000 jin of grain, more than 70 cattle and sheep. They organized seven peasant associations and eight armed work teams. Most of the comrades transferred from Shandong to Shanxinan. Near Qiji, more than 30 enemy troops from the enemy district headquarters near Qiji went to Qiji to loot supplies. The enemy, pulling three large carts, swaggered out of the east gate of Qiji. Suddenly, there was a burst of gunfire in the fields. The Li Rutai Armed Work Team surrounded them from all sides. The enemy abandoned one corpse, two wounded, and more than a thousand jin of flour on three large carts, and fled. In early December of last year, they also cooperated with the Chengwu Brigade to capture the Dongzhuang stronghold. At the start of the attack, the enemy opened the back door and ran. The armed work team chased fiercely for five or six li, and more than 30 enemies dropped all their coats and ran. They immediately destroyed the fortifications of Da Dongzhuang. They sometimes went to the highway to sabotage enemy transportation. Once, they fought guerrillas at Longwang Temple. The enemy was setting up telephone wires in front, and they were collecting the telephone wires behind, only half a li apart. Once, they went to the enemy's first line of wooden barricades to post propaganda. They discovered telephone wires under their feet and immediately divided the work. Two comrades entangled the telephone wires, wrapping them for more than twenty steps. Suddenly, the twenty or so enemies setting up the telephone wires returned. They looked up and were only a dozen steps away. They ran back vigilantly. The enemy used flashlights to illuminate them. They lay down when illuminated, and got up to run again when not illuminated. After reaching the assembly point, they cut eight li of the enemy's telephone wires.

    湖西人民斗争的旗帜
    李汝泰武工队
    【本报冀鲁豫七日电】湖西李汝泰武工队于去年九月开始组织，当时湖西局面不稳定，敌人气势凶凶，武工队只有四十余人，由李汝泰同志领导，在蒋军后方单（县）碣（山）公路两旁，公开镇压地主特务，为群众撑腰，经过一月中的坚持斗争，才奉命移到钜（野）南休整。去年十月，分区决定派李汝泰武工队去湖西，他们于十一月十三日出发，晚上走路，白天睡觉，十天没见过太阳，到单西北徐寺集一天没吃饭，派李、王等同志到集上买东西吃，当时集上正有伪县府人员在开伪乡保长会议，大摆酒席，他们大胆闯过去，一个在门口，两个闯进屋去，抡开匣枪，踢翻酒席，伪政府人员满街乱跑，他们也随着追出来，横冲直闯，乱打乱叫，伪县府一个科长跑出村外，被李汝泰同志活捉了，伪员们还不知道是怎么一回事。到湖西后，就一边战斗，一边宣传，宣传内容都是群众眼前的材料，时间、地点、人名都调查非常具体，有时制成歌谣，到处贴到处写，彻夜不休息，有时到半夜分头到各村高房子上大叫：“大家请坐起来听消息”，简单有力的说完一个问题就走开，第二天二三十个村庄同时都传着八路军的消息，群众情绪又高涨了。在赶集的时候，李汝泰武工队忽然又出现在集市上，队员们分布在各处，同时展开宣传，简单扼要，说完就走，这一宣传收效很大，物价因之平稳，鲁钞信用因之抬高。在六个月中，宣传人数达二十万。李汝泰武工队又进行了反特务工作，每到一村，就叫地主、保甲长、伪属进行登记、详记亲属财产，叫他们集合起来向群众宣誓，找连环保，并允群众告密，很坏的抓起来，立即镇压，同时领导群众反奸诉苦，反倒算倒粮倒地，前后掀起田庄等四十余村的土改运动。倒回土地一顷多，粮食六万七千余斤，牛羊七十多头，组织了七个农会，八个武工队。大部同志由单东转到单西南，戚集附近敌区部三十余人到戚集拉东西，敌人拉着三辆大车，大摇大摆出了戚集东门，忽然地里一阵枪响，李汝泰武工队四方八面的围上来了，敌人抛下一俱死尸、两个负伤的和三辆大车上千多斤白面逃窜了。去年十二月初又配合城武大队打下了董庄据点，攻击开始，敌人打开后门跑了，武工队猛追五六里，三十多敌人将大衣全部丢下跑了，当即平毁了大董庄工事。他们有时也到公路上去破坏敌人交通，一次到龙王庙打游击，敌人在前面架电线，他们就在后面收电线，相隔不过半里路，有一次去到敌人的头道木砦上去贴宣传品，发现脚下有电线，马上就分工，两个同志缠电线，缠了二十几步，忽然架电线的二十几个敌人回来了，一抬头只离开十几步远了，他们机警回跑，敌人用手电筒照，他们就躺下，不照起来再跑，到集合点后，又把敌人八里长的电线收割了。
