　　[This Dispatch from our Jinnan Office on the 20th] Mole crickets were numerous in Shenzhai Village, Erqu District, Qiuxian County. Since spring, they had replanted four or five times, but the seedlings were all destroyed by mole crickets, greatly affecting the production enthusiasm of the masses. The leadership explained to the masses the situations and methods of catching mole crickets in various places as reported in the newspapers. The masses said, "If others can catch mole crickets and have good methods, can't we do the same?" More than a thousand men, women, old and young people in the whole village were urgently mobilized and launched a three-day assault, and most of the mole crickets have been eliminated. By the 27th of last month, the masses were relieved to rush to plant, and organized 29 temporary mutual aid groups, each group with ten people and equipped with two oxen per planting machine. Within four days, they completed planting late seedlings on 3,100 mu.

　　[This Dispatch from our Jinnan Office on the 20th] The large-scale locust extermination battle of 5,000 people in Weixian County has now reached a climax. The slogan "Resolutely leave no one alive, fighting locusts is like fighting old Chiang at the front" resounded throughout the fields. According to statistics from the Fourth and Seventh Districts of the county, more than 60,000 jin of locusts have been eliminated. When locust nymphs were discovered in Hecun Village, Chengci District, the masses immediately established a comprehensive reconnaissance and surveillance network. All men, women, old and young people in the whole village turned out to dig ditches, encircle and annihilate the locusts. From early morning until sunset, all locust nymphs were completely wiped out.
