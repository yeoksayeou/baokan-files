Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. According to TASS, Athens, Greek guerrillas are extremely active. A communiqué from the headquarters of the Greek 85th Military District declared: On the evening of June 27th, a large force of guerrillas attacked government troops in the city of Lidoriki. According to newspaper reports, the guerrillas occupied the city and warehouses, and after burning houses, actively withdrew. In the southern Peloponnese peninsula, government troops have been fighting guerrillas for more than a week, but the guerrillas have long since moved to the central part of the island, leaving the government troops to search in vain everywhere. In this situation, the Greek authorities are utterly embarrassed. Official newspapers have repeatedly claimed that guerrilla commander Markos has been killed; but now they announce: a reward of 20 million drachmas for anyone who kills Markos.

    希游击队极度活跃
    反动当局窘态毕露
    【新华社陕北八日电】据塔斯社雅典讯，希腊游击队极度活跃。希第八十五军区总部公报宣称：六月二十七日晚，有大队游击队袭击利多里基安城之政府军。据报纸消息，游击队于占领该城及仓库并焚毁房后即主动撤退。在摩里亚半岛南部政府军已向游击队作战一周多，但游击队早已转入该岛中部活动，使政府军处处扑空。在此情况下，希腊当局窘态毕露，官方报纸曾一再扬言游击队司令马尔科斯已被杀死；但今又宣布：凡杀死马尔科斯者赏希币二千万。
