    Improve Skills and Prepare for a Major Counteroffensive
    Our Army on the Taiyue Front Massively Trains Engineers and Artillerymen
    [This newspaper Taiyue Front Fifteenth dispatch] Frontline reporter Ai Bo reports: The People's Liberation Army in Southern Shanxi is massively training engineer and artillery special forces to improve their skills and prepare for a major counteroffensive. This technical learning for these special forces began last week, and everyone's enthusiasm for learning is extremely high. The Fourth Engineer Company's location is five *li* away from the learning site, and they travel back and forth eight times a day without feeling tired. Sometimes they even sacrifice lunch and naps to study and review. As soon as Cong Feng'an of the Second Company gets up in the morning, he goes to dig fortifications, and if the first one doesn't work, he digs a second one. Yan Caiwang of the First Artillery Company doesn't even rest on Sundays. The soldiers help each other, and the spirit of "starting the engine" to find solutions is particularly good. Artillerymen Gao Yuewa and Duan Desheng help new comrades set the sight and practice disassembly and assembly whenever they have time. Yan Zongshi, Dui Ziying, and Guo Shuilu are implementing mutual assistance education: one person teaches, one person learns, and one person checks; they take turns learning and help each other. Now the skills of both new and veteran engineer soldiers have improved significantly, and their movements are twice as fast as before. In the past, it took the artillerymen two minutes to load a cannon; now it only takes ninety seconds to unload, assemble, and fire. As long as the target can be seen accurately, the characteristics of the cannon can be grasped, and the position is good, it is possible to achieve a hundred hits out of a hundred shots. A certain unit has invented a new aiming method, such as shooting at a bunker, which can accurately hit it through the embrasure.

    提高技术准备大反攻
    太岳前线我军集训工兵炮兵
    【本报太岳前线十五日电】前线记者艾柏报导：晋南人民解放军集训工、炮特种兵，提高技术，准备大反攻。此项兵种的技术学习于上周开始，大家的学习情绪异常高涨，工兵四连驻地离学习地点五里，一天来回八次，均不感到疲劳。有时竟牺牲午饭和午睡来研究检讨。二连丛凤安一早起就去挖工事，第一个不行，再挖第二个。炮兵一连的阎才旺，星期日也不休息。战士们互相帮助，“开动机器”想办法的精神特别好。炮兵高月娃、段得胜有空就帮助新同志定表尺与练习拆装。阎宗时、兑子英、郭水禄三人实行互助教育：一人教，一人学，一人检查；轮流学习，互相帮助。现在新老工兵战士技术都显著提高，动作比过去加快一倍。过去炮兵两分钟装一次炮，现在只须九十秒就可以卸下、装好、打响。只要目标看得准，能够掌握炮的特点，阵地好，可以做到百发百中。某部发明了一种新的瞄准方法，如射击一个碉堡，能准确的从炮眼里打进去。
