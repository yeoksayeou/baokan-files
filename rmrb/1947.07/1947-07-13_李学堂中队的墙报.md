    The Wall Newspaper of the Li Xuetang Squad
    Hu Zheng
    In the 47th issue of the "Gongqi" (Merit Flag) newspaper, there is a short article about the blackboard newspaper of the Li Xuetang Squad, which begins: "Everyone knows that Comrade Song Qi is a model correspondent. He was personally cultivated by Comrade Li Xuetang. Although Comrade Song Qi's sacrifice made him sad, he did not forget to continue cultivating second and third new Song Qis, and now he has cultivated quite a few. ......"
    Comrade Li Xuetang is the deputy instructor of the Second Company. When he was the instructor, Comrade Song Qi was his clerk. Later, they worked together in the company. Comrade Song Qi was with him from the time he joined the army until the moment he shed his last drop of blood for the people, so he never left his tireless cultivation. Thus, Comrade Song Qi became the banner of army correspondents. Comrade Li Xuetang's contribution, like Comrade Song Qi's, will not be forgotten by anyone. And in the past, Comrade Li Xuetang only cultivated Song Qi, but now he is making more Song Qis grow continuously. Moreover, its members are not limited to clerks; from instructors, platoon leaders, cooks, to soldiers, all are involved in the reporting craze under the leadership of Comrade Li Xuetang. And they have expanded this work from the field of writing to the field of cartoons.
    At the beginning of the training, Comrade Li Xuetang convened a meeting of the clerks of each squad to establish universal wall newspaper work. It was stipulated that each unit should run two wall newspapers. One serves as the "organ paper" of the team headquarters, praising the achievements of each class, platoon, and individual at any time; the other serves as the "soldiers' garden," with chalk placed next to it, and anyone who has an opinion can write on it. In addition, he called on cadres and soldiers of all units to run their own newspapers and write themselves at various meetings to improve training enthusiasm and learning interest.
    After such careful arrangements, the wall newspapers of the entire company developed rapidly and vigorously. In just two weeks of training, it has exceeded the original plan several times. Now, let's make a preliminary review of the achievements of these two weeks.
    In terms of quantity, it was originally expected that each unit would have two, but the company headquarters initially established four on the playground: one to announce the victory news from all battlefields across the country, one as a soldier's garden, and the other two as the highest authority newspapers in the entire company, where only the most outstanding events and people from each unit can be featured.
    The Fifth Squad also erected the same four newspapers in the concentrated dining area. What is different from the company is that the soldiers' garden does not use chalk to write, but writes on paper and pastes it on the wall. And the Fourth Squad is even more active: at the beginning, there were only two, one cloth and one blackboard. In the second week, it grew in each class and platoon. When the soldiers were resting, they carried black oil pots and opened up a rectangular small blackboard on their dormitory or courtyard wall. But before it was dry, someone started writing, and some couldn't wipe it off, so they wrote it on paper and pasted it on. The two blackboards of the Third Platoon were filled in half a day. Comrade Zheng Weishun, the clerk of the Fourth Squad, made a statistic at the end of the second week: there are a total of nine wall newspapers in the whole team, and a total of 145 articles were received in two weeks. This is only the number published by the team headquarters, not including those of each class and platoon.
    Although its development was so rapid, it was not easy at the beginning. At first, only the clerk and instructor supported it, and the submissions from the reporting team of each platoon were limited, especially the "Soldiers' Garden," which was not worthy of its name and often suffered from a shortage of articles. So Comrade Li Xuetang called on to promote a democratic style at several meetings, and to write down any opinions. One day, a large character appeared on the large blackboard on the playground:
    "Can the instructor's temper solve the problem?"
    Comrade Li Xuetang replied below: "Cannot solve."
    These short two lines attracted the attention of the entire company, and the soldiers gathered around to watch and discuss with laughter during the rest. The next day, various question-and-answer things appeared in the "Soldiers' Garden" of each unit:
    "Should the squad leader glare at me?"
    "Why don't we eat bean sprouts?"
    "Why doesn't Squad Leader Hu work?"
    At the beginning, it was so simple, but as more questions were raised, it gradually became deeper. A cook in the Fourth Squad had a quarrel with the squad leader, and he neither ate nor cooked, so the newspaper wrote that day:
    "Comrade ××, are you working for everyone or for the squad leader? You are an old comrade, please reply!"
    After reading it, he thought for a night, and replied the next day:
    "This is my fault, I will correct it immediately." Really, he has become better since then.
    Once, after the health inspection team visited various places, their opinions were immediately written on the blackboard newspaper of the unit:
    "The Sixth Squad is a model squad. Seeing that you are not hygienic in cooking, I hope you will cook well and clean it up in the future. Comrades will have no opinion on you, right? Please forgive me!" "Comrade cooks of the Fifth Squad work conscientiously and actively, and pay attention to hygiene. The rice is washed three to five times, and the vegetables are also washed cleanly. They are tasty and delicious. Everyone should learn from you and hope you will work harder!" Since then, the Fifth Squad's kitchen has become a hygiene model for the entire company, and has now become a model cooking squad for the entire regiment.
    Since the wall newspaper can immediately carry out mass praise and criticism, various tasks have achieved great results. From the contents of the various wall newspapers in the past two weeks, we can see the work progress and achievements of each squad. This achievement is not only reflected in training, but more importantly, in ideological gains. For example, any good performance of the newly arrived liberated soldiers is immediately reflected in the wall newspaper, so that they can thoroughly realize the "no talent wasted" and the happy and pleasant democratic life of the Eighth Route Army. Therefore, those who wanted to escape were also moved and became more active. From the wall newspaper, we can also see that various model figures are rapidly growing up, such as the cooking class of the Fifth Squad, the grenadier Zhang Shuangxi of the Fourth Squad, the grievance-telling model Wu Shuanglin of the Sixth Squad, Lu Senlin, etc., all have become the banner of the entire company. These are all undeniable achievements of the wall newspaper.
    The wall newspaper of the Li Xuetang Squad also has a characteristic, that is, it has launched a warm cartoon and allegro movement. In the past two weeks, among the 337 articles in the wall newspapers above the squad level, allegro accounts for two-fifths of the total, and cartoons account for one-third. These two things are the most popular among the soldiers. Often in the pile of people surrounding the wall newspaper, a comrade reads aloud to everyone. Some people can't read ordinary text in one breath, but they are particularly fluent in reading allegro, and the rhythm is more and more vigorous. Some soldiers who can't write write the allegro by themselves and ask others to write it down for them and submit it to the wall newspaper. In this way, the wall newspaper has become the real garden of the soldiers themselves, and also the most beloved reading material.
    These allegros often appear on top of cartoons. At the beginning of the training, the superior called for paying attention to hygiene. A picture appeared on the cloth wall newspaper of the Sixth Squad: a person drinking cold water, and another person spitting out a breath, which read: "Drinking cold water is not hygienic, and you will get sick if you drink it in your stomach..." The appearance of this novel thing shocked the entire company. So cartoon with allegro works appeared successively on the wall newspapers of each unit. The content it reflects is the soldiers' own daily life: throwing grenades, aiming, practicing, the people helping the army with washing and sewing, the army helping the people with fetching water, sweeping the floor, and cutting wheat, the clerk giving sick patients soup and eggs, who promotes revolutionary friendship and gives someone a pair of shoes, a pair of trousers... These things are reflected very quickly, and they are posted early the next morning after they happened last night. Therefore, the wall newspaper is always fresh. The soldiers love it, and everyone will get education and encouragement from the wall newspaper. Some paintings are marked with people's names, and some are not, so the soldiers secretly take a pen and write the names of their squad leader or someone on it, so that everyone knows that this is the matter of their squad leader. Some people take the paintings down and give them to the landlord as a gift, so the landlord is also happy to post them in his own home.
    There are four famous painters in the entire company: one is Wang Zhenfu, the instructor of the Sixth Squad, and one is Li Jinwei, the instructor of the Fifth Squad. One is Yang Derong, the company clerk. One is Ge Sanjun, the cooking class of the Fifth Squad. Although the skills are very poor, their works are loved by the soldiers. Because they are all directly serving the soldiers. The soldiers' focus is not on the quality of the painting, but on the content of the painting. Wang Zhenfu often said: "It doesn't matter if it's good or not, as long as that's the meaning." This "meaning" is the content and theme. After the soldiers' appraisal, their content and theme are what the soldiers want to say. So the soldiers say good.
    These soldier painters have a common characteristic: they are all from poor peasants. In the past, they had neither cultural cultivation nor specialized painting, and it is even more surprising that most of them only learned to paint during this training. Some people asked Comrades Li Jinwei and Wang Zhenfu why they couldn't in the past, but now they can all of a sudden? They said: "The soldiers love to paint, and there are few people who can paint, so just try to paint..." And with this try, they all succeeded.
    What is particularly worth introducing here is Comrade Ge Sanjun. He is the deputy head of the cooking class. He is from Xingtai, 34 years old. He was born in a poor peasant family and did not go to school at home. He only learned to paint after joining the Eighth Route Army. He is very busy every day, and he works overtime to paint every night. Sometimes he paints until dawn. He has the most works. In addition to submitting to the wall newspaper, he also often paints large paintings of two or three feet long and posts them everywhere in the street. His output is very amazing. He painted 47 paintings in two weeks. People are constantly asking him for paintings every day, and he has become the most prestigious painter in the entire company.
    In addition to these four, there are also the instructor of the Fourth Squad, the clerk of the Sixth Squad, the deputy of the Second Platoon, and several soldiers who often submit paintings to the wall newspaper. There are also many soldiers who have begun to pick up paintbrushes. In the Li Xuetang Squad, cartoons and allegros have become mass art. The main driving force is the result of Comrade Li Xuetang's leadership in the mass line. This painting team and poetry team will have as brilliant artistic achievements in the future as their combat prospects. This point can be fully wished in advance. Then the future Song Qi will be more and more than now.

### 李学堂中队的墙报

    李学堂中队的墙报
    胡征
    在四十七期“功旗”报上，有一篇短文，谈到李学堂中队的黑板报，开始这样写着：“谁都知道宋琦同志是一个模范通讯员。这是李学堂同志亲手培养起来的。宋琦同志的牺牲，虽然使他难过，但他并没有忘记继续培养第二第三个新的宋琦，现在培养的已不少了。…………”
    李学堂同志是二中队的副教导员，在他当指导员时，宋琦同志就跟他当文书。后来，他们又一起到中队工作。宋琦同志自参加部队一直到为人民流出最后一滴血的时候，始终和他在一起，所以也没离开他始终不倦的培植。于是，宋琦同志成为部队通讯员的旗帜。李学堂同志的功劳，和宋琦同志一样，谁都不会忘记的。而从前，李学堂同志培养的仅只宋琦一个，现在则使更多的宋琦不断地生长起来。并且，其成员不仅限于文书，从指导员，班排长、炊事员、以至于战士，都在李学堂同志的领导下卷入报导的热潮中。而且把这工作从文字领域扩展到漫画的领域里了。
    在练兵开始时，李学堂同志召集了各小队文书开会，建立普遍的墙报工作。规定每单位办两个墙报。一个作为队部的“机关报”，随时表扬各班排及个人的成绩；另一个作为“战士园地”，旁边放着粉笔，谁有意见就往上写。此外又在各会上号召各单位干部战士自己办报，自己写，以提高练兵积极性和学习兴趣。
    经过这样的周密布置以后，全中队的墙报就迅速蓬勃地发展起来。仅在练兵的两周中间，已超过原来的计划几倍了。现在，谨就这两周的成绩，来作一次初步的检阅。
    在数量上，原来预计每单位两个，而中队部一开始就在操场上建立了四个，一个公布全国各战场的胜利消息，一个是战士园地，另外两个是全中队最高的权威报，各单位最出色的事件和人物才能上这个报。
    五小队也在集中的饭场上，竖起同样的四个报。它不同于中队的，是战士园地不是用粉笔写，而是写在纸上往墙上贴的。而四小队更活跃了：开始还只两个，一个布的，一个黑板。到第二周就在各班排里发长起来了。战士们在休息的时候，提着黑油烟筒，在自己宿舍或院墙上开辟一块长方形的小黑板。可是没等晒干，就有人开始写了，有的看着擦不掉，就写在纸上往上贴。三排的两个黑板，半天的时间都贴满了。四小队文书郑维顺同志在第二周的末尾作了一个统计：全队墙报共九个，两周内来稿共计一百四十五篇。这仅是队部发表的数字，各班排的不在内。
    其发展虽如此迅速，但开始时并不是很容易的。开始，只是文书和指导员支持，各排的报导小组的来稿也有限，尤其“战士园地”，名不符实，常闹稿荒。于是李学堂同志在几次会上号召发扬民主作风，有啥意见就往上写，有一天，在操场的大黑板上，出现了一条大字：
    “教导员发脾气能不能解决问题？”
    李学堂同志就在那下面回答了：“不能解决。”
    这短短的两行字，引起了全中队的注意，休息时，战士们都围上去看，笑着议论开了。第二天，各单位的“战士园地”上，都出现了各种问答式的东西：
    “小队长向我瞪眼应当不应当？”
    “咱们为啥不吃豆芽呢？”
    “胡班长为啥不干工作？”
    开始是这样浅显的，但问题提多了就渐渐深刻了。四小队一个炊事员和小队长闹蹩扭，不吃也不做，于是当天报上就写着：
    “××同志，你作工作是给大家作的还是给小队长作的？你是个老同志，请答复！”
    他看了，考虑了一夜，第二天就答复说：
    “这是我的不对，马上就改正。”真的，他就从此变好了。
    一次，卫生检查组到各处参观后，意见随即写在该单位的黑板报上：
    “六小队是模范小队，看到你们作饭不卫生，希望你们以后把饭作好，弄干净，同志们对你们就没意见了，对不对？请原谅！”“五小队炊事员同志工作认真积极，卫生讲的好，米淘三次到五次，菜也洗的干净，有味道、好吃、大家都要向你们学习，希望你们更努力下去！”这以后，五小队火房，成为全中队的卫生模范，现在已成为全团的模范炊事班了。
    由于墙报能即时地展开群众性的表扬与批评，于是使各种工作都获得了很大成绩。从两周来各个墙报的内容上，可以看出各小队的工作进展与成绩。这成绩不仅表现在练兵上，更重要的，是思想上的收获。如对新来的解放战士，任何一点好的表现都即时地反映到墙报上，使他们都彻底认识到八路军的“不屈才”和民主生活的幸福愉快。因此有想逃跑的也被感动而更积极了。从墙报中又可以看出各个模范典型人物迅速地成长起来，如五小队的炊事班，四小队投弹手张双喜，六小队的诉苦模范武双林，芦森林等等，都成为全中队的旗帜。这些都是不能忽视的墙报的功绩。
    李学堂中队的墙报，还有一个特色，就是展开了热烈的漫画和快板运动。在两周以来，小队以上的墙报，三百三十七篇稿件中，快板占总数的五分之二，漫画占三分之一。这两种东西都是战士们最欢迎的，常常在墙报跟前围着的一堆人中间，有一个同志高声念给大家听，有的念普通文字时一口气念不下来，而念快板就特别流利，音韵抑扬，越念越起劲。有些不会写字的战士，自己把快板编好，请别人替他写下来，投给墙报。这样，墙报就成为战士自己真正的园地，也是最心爱的读物了。
    这些快板，往往出现在漫画上面。在开始练兵时，上级号召讲卫生，六小队的布墙报上出现了一幅画：一个人喝凉水，另一个人嘴里吐出一股气，里面写着：“喝凉水，不卫生，喝到肚里就生病………”这个新奇东西的出现，震动了全中队。于是漫画带快板的作品就陆续在各单位的墙报上出现了。它所反映的内容都是战士们自己的日常生活：投弹、瞄准、演习、老百姓帮军队洗衣缝被，军队帮老百姓挑水、扫地、割麦，事务长给病号端汤送鸡蛋，谁发扬革命友爱送谁一双鞋、一条裤子……这些事都反映得很快，昨夜发生的，今天一早就贴出来了。因此，墙报永远是新鲜的。战士们谁都爱，谁也会从墙报上得到教育和鼓励。有的画上标着人名，有的没标，于是战士们偷偷地拿笔把自己的班长或谁的名字写在上面，好让大家知道这是自己班长的事。有的把画揭下来，当作礼物送给房东，于是房东也高兴地贴在自己家里了。
    全中队有四位名画家：一位是六小队指导员王振付，一位是五小队指导员李金维。一位是中队文书杨德荣。一位是五小队炊事班葛三俊。在技巧上虽然都很差，但他们的作品都为战士喜爱。因他们都是直接为兵服务的。战士们的着眼点并不在于画的好坏，而在于所画的内容。王振付常说：“好不好吧，只要是那个意思就行。”这“意思”就是内容和主题。经过了战士们的鉴定，他们的内容和主题都是战士们自己要说的话。所以战士们说好。
    这些战士的画家们，有一个共同的特点：都是出身于贫苦农民。过去既没有文化修养，又没有专心学过画，更使人惊奇的是：大部分都是这次练兵才学的，有人问李金维和王振付同志怎么过去不会，现在一下子会了呢？他们说：“战士们爱画，会画的人又少，就这么画一下试试…………”而这么一试，都成功了。
    这里特别值得介绍的是葛三俊同志。他是炊事班副班长。邢台人，三十四岁。贫农出身，在家没念过书，参加八路以后才学画画。他每天工作很忙，每夜都开夜车画画。有时一直画到天明。他的作品最多，除了向墙报投稿，还经常画二三尺长的大画，满街到处张贴，他的产量是很惊人的，两周内就画了四十七幅。每天向他要画的人不断，他已成为全中队名望最高的画家了。
    除了这四位，还有四小队的指导员，六小队的文书，二排副以及若干战士，常向墙报投画稿。还有不少战士已开始拿起画笔来了，在李学堂中队里，漫画和快板已成为群众性的艺术了。其主要动力，是李学堂同志走群众路线领导的结果。这个画的队伍、诗的队伍，未来的艺术成绩会象他们作战前途一样的辉煌。这一点是完全可以预祝的。那么未来的宋琦将会比现在还更多更多的了。
