　　[This Report] Neiqiu Shentou Village: Save and Save Again
    【This Report】Liu Chunxiao, the production committee member of Shentou Village in Neiqiu, seeing that relying on the harvest for the year was hopeless, put forward the slogan "Save and Save Again." His family of four reduced their daily food consumption before the wheat harvest to eight-and-a-half *he* per person, and then further reduced it by half a *he* of grain. They ate mostly vegetables and very little grain, and appropriately adjusted the eight *he* of grain that the four people should eat, preparing to weather the famine for a long period.
