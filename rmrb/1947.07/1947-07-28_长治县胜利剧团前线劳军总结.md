　　Changzhi County Victory Theatre Troupe Frontline 慰劳 Summary
    Shi Bingqian

    The Victory Theatre Troupe, upon receiving instructions from higher authorities on April 19th, departed for the Henan-North front to offer慰劳 performances, led by Troupe Leader Cheng Liankao and Instructor Wang Congwen, with a group of over fifty people. They victoriously returned on June 10th, after more than fifty days, having performed plays such as "The White Haired Girl," "Blood and Tears of Hatred," "Three Attacks on the Zhu Family Village," "Glorious Flower," and "Celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival" twenty-two times. They慰劳ed seventeen units. In addition to performing, the troupe, under the leadership of Troupe Leader Cheng, collectively wrote "Double Happiness at the Door" and rehearsed "Steaming Dry Rations" during their rest periods. Instructor Wang delved into the troops to gather materials and wrote twenty-two segments of quick板 about anti-enemy heroes. Drum lyric expert Li Bingyuan wrote nineteen segments of hero stories, learning and singing while writing during the performances. The troops were very interested, and the new plays greatly inspired the soldiers. The troops also voluntarily gave the troupe three horses and fourteen rifles as a reward. In short, this慰劳 performance of the troupe can be summarized in eight words: "Praised throughout the front, returned fully loaded." The following experiences are worth mentioning:

    I. Thorough ideological mobilization, establishing a clear perspective of serving the people, and resolving everyone's family difficulties were guarantees of the success of this慰劳 performance. After the troupe received instructions for the慰劳 performance, most of the members were not enthusiastic, mainly because family production in Henan-North would be difficult, and another reason was that the慰劳 performance was unpaid labor, without earning money. We seized this point and carried out in-depth mobilization on one hand: from a positive perspective, pointing out that this慰劳 performance was a good opportunity for the troupe to truly serve the soldiers and the war. Everyone had turned over in the mass struggle, so they should use their performances to encourage the soldiers to win more battles in order to protect the fruits of their liberation. On the other hand, the government also promised to ensure that everyone's family would not have difficulties in planting. After such mobilization and the resolution of practical difficulties, most people's emotions changed from stable to high.

    When the troupe arrived at the logistics headquarters, Director Xing gave another mobilization, explaining that the front was not like the rear, that materials were very difficult, and that the comrades had to think of more ways to solve the stage problem, and even had to do it themselves when necessary. At this time, troupe member Wang Futian said: We are here to慰劳, and we must never add trouble to the troops, ensuring that we will build the stage ourselves and borrow tables, benches, and utensils. This overcame the previous passive attitude of performing if there was a stage and leaving if there wasn't. Because everyone was mentally prepared, whenever they arrived at a place and there was no stage, everyone worked together to quickly build the stage so that they could perform. Because everyone deeply understood that the慰劳 performance must satisfy the troops, they based themselves on: performing whenever they saw something that could be performed, overcoming the previous fear of performing too much and being tired. The soldiers' reflection was "After watching Blood and Tears of Hatred, we will capture Sun Dianying alive."

    II. The plot must be combined with reality, suitable for the needs of the troops, and the role of inspiring morale will be great. In more than fifty days of performing, after investigation and research to understand that the troops were conducting education on翻身訴苦, they performed plays such as "The White Haired Girl" and "Blood and Tears of Hatred", which the troops were very satisfied with. Sun, the Section Chief of a certain unit, mentioned that Comrade ××× of the direct team, who usually thought that the mass struggle was excessive, greatly changed his argument after watching "The White Haired Girl". He added a "not" to the "excessive", immediately changing from excessive to not excessive. Yang, the Section Chief of the 18th Brigade, said that the performance of "Blood and Tears of Hatred" was a "shot in the arm" for the education of the troops. Every soldier reflected this way: "After watching Blood and Tears of Hatred, we are determined to dig up the old roots." The troupe understood that some soldiers often worried about the difficulties of family life and production, so they immediately performed plays such as "Glorious Flower" and "Celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival". The soldiers all said after watching: "Originally, I planned to ask for a few days off to go home to see, but after watching Glorious Flower and Celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival, there is no need to ask for leave to go home", it is simply "Watching Glorious Flower is like returning home." Sun, the Section Chief of a certain unit, said: "Watching a night of drama is better than teaching ten days of class." The Deputy Political Commissar of the 51st Regiment said: This performance not only educated the soldiers, but also educated the cadres. This performance played a great role in consolidating the troops and inspiring the soldiers' fighting spirit.

    III. Writing during performances and performing during writing enriched the troupe and developed the work. The Victory Theatre Troupe's frontline慰劳 performance was the first time ever. Because it had always performed in the rear in the past, there were very few plays about troop battles. This time, in order to make the troops more satisfied, the troupe leader, instructor, cultural teacher, and drum lyric expert personally went to the troops to investigate and research, collect materials, and wrote the "Double Happiness at the Door" that reported merits on the front in the midst of their busy schedule and rehearsed "Steaming Dry Rations." Instructor Wang and drum lyric expert Li Bingyuan rushed to write quick板 and drum lyrics of heroic stories about killing enemies, forty-one segments in total, and organized the young comrades to perform and sing. The troops especially loved to watch the performances that were mostly about frontline activities.

    IV. By commending merits and models, we improved morale and overcame the actors' backward thinking. Most of the actors in the troupe were not in high spirits when they set out for this慰劳 performance. The main reasons were: first, they couldn't make money, second, they were afraid of delaying planting at home, and some were afraid of running around. The leadership first enlightened and mobilized them from the perspective of class consciousness, saying that the purpose of the troupe's慰劳 performance was to dig up the old roots and protect the rice bowl, and at the same time, emphasized that everyone should launch a wave of everyone earning merits and adding merit upon merit during the慰劳 performance. At the end of the慰劳 performance, they also commended merits, set models, summarized experiences, and appointed Li Haiyu, Liu Yi'en and other six people who had made meritorious service, giving them material rewards. The emotions of each member have always been positive and tense, and some backward thoughts have been overcome in the face of righteousness.

    V. The weaknesses were exposed in the慰劳 performance, the enthusiasm for learning was improved, and the arrogant old master style was gradually overcome. The troupe is relatively old and has always been popular in the old area, which has invisibly cultivated the members' ideological arrogance and backward style of posing as old qualifications. During this慰劳 performance, when the troop leaders repeatedly asked to perform more plays about anti-enemy heroes and reporting and congratulating on merits, they exposed their weaknesses, which was very pitiful, they didn't have any at all. At this time, the members felt that most of the plays they performed were not suitable for the needs of the soldiers, and they felt that their repertoire was poor and pitiful. At this time, the leadership seized this point and asked everyone to discuss, didn't we always think that we were very good, why can't we fully answer the troops' request today, what is the reason? From then on, the members no longer dared to pose as old qualifications, and at the same time, the enthusiasm for learning new plays and creating new plays was increased.

　　长治县胜利剧团前线劳军总结
    史秉谦
    胜利剧团于四月十九日得到上级指示，由团长程联考，指导员王聪文率领，一行五十余人出发豫北前线劳军。于六月十日胜利归来，共五十多天，计演出白毛女、血泪仇、三打祝家庄、光荣花、过中秋等剧二十二次，慰问单位十七处、剧团本身除演出外，又乘休息时间在程团长领导下集体写作“双喜进门”排演“蒸干粮”两剧。王指导员深入部队搜集材料，编写杀敌英雄快板二十二段。鼓词能手李丙元写英雄故事十九段，在演出中边写边学边唱。部队很感兴趣，由于新剧演出后，对战士鼓舞很大。部队方面也自动送给剧团马三匹、步枪十四支作为报酬。总之该剧团这次劳军用八个字的概括“誉满前方，满载而归”值得提出的有以下几点经验。
    一、经过深入的思想动员，树立为民服务的明确观点，解决大家家庭困难，是这次劳军胜利的保证。在剧团得到劳军指示后，大部分团员情绪不高，主要原因是到了豫北家庭生产没办法；另一原因劳军是白效劳，赚不上钱。我们抓住这点就一面作深入动员：从积极方面指出这次劳军是剧团真正为兵为战争服务的好机会。大家在群众斗争中都翻了身，就应用演剧鼓舞战士多打胜仗，来保卫翻身果实。一面政府又提出保证大家家里下种没困难。经过这样动员与实际困难的解决下，大部分情绪由稳定而高涨起来。
    剧团到达后勤指挥部时，又经过邢主任一次动员说明前方不比后方，物质很困难，舞台问题还须同志们多想办法，必要时还须亲自动手。这时团员王福田就说：我们是劳军，绝不能给部队增加麻烦，保证舞台自己搭，桌凳用具自己借，把过去有舞台就演没啦就拉倒的消极情绪克服了。由于大家思想都有了准备，果然每到一地，出演没有舞台，大家就一齐动手，很快就把舞台搞好，就能出演。由于大家深深了解劳军一定要让部队心满意足，由此他们本着：看到啥时演到啥时，克服了从前怕多演怕疲劳情绪，战士的反映是“看了血泪仇，活捉孙殿英。”
    二、剧情必须结合实际，适合部队要求，鼓舞士气的作用才大。在五十多天的演剧经过调查研究了解部队正在进行翻身诉苦教育时，他们就演白毛女、血泪仇等剧，部队看了很满意。某部队孙科长谈到直属队×××同志，平素对群众斗争总认为过火，看了白毛女后他的论调大大变了，过火上加了个不字，马上由过火变成不过火了。十八旅杨科长谈血泪仇出演对部队的教育真是一针见血。每个战士都这样反映：“看了血泪仇，坚决刨老根”，剧团了解部分战士经常顾虑家庭生活，生产的困难，他们马上就演光荣花、过中秋等剧。战士看了都这样说：“本来打算请几天假回家看看，看了光荣花、过中秋后请假回家思想也就没啥必要了”，简直是“看了光荣花如同回了家。”某部队孙科长说：“看了一夜剧，胜教十天课。”五十一团副政委说：这次演剧不但教育了战士，也教育了干部。这次演剧对巩固部队鼓舞战士斗志的作用很大。
    三、在演出中编写，编写中演出丰富了剧团，开展了工作。胜利剧团前线劳军还是破天荒第一次。由于他过去老是在后方演出，所以在部队战斗方面的剧本很少，这次劳军他们为了要更使部队满意，就由团长、指导员、文化教员、鼓词能手亲自动手深入部队调查研究，搜集材料，在百忙中写出前方的报功的“双喜进门”并排演“蒸干粮”两剧。王指导员及鼓词能手李丙元赶写杀敌英雄英勇故事等快板，鼓词四十一段，并组织小同志边演边唱，部队看了所演节目多系前方活动，特别爱看。
    四、通过表功表模，提高了情绪，克服了演员的落后思想。剧团这次出发劳军大部分演员情绪不高，主要原因：第一不能赚钱，第二怕耽误了家里下种，还有的怕跑路。在领导上首先从阶级觉悟启发鼓动他们剧团劳军为的刨老根保饭碗，同时又强调大家在劳军中要掀起人人立功，功上加功的浪潮。劳军结束时又进行表功、表模，总结经验，并聘选李海鱼、刘义恩等六人分别立了功，予以物质奖励，各团员情绪始终是积极紧张，一些落后思想在正气面前克服下去了。
    五、在劳军中暴露了弱点，提高了学习情绪，高傲老大作风逐渐克服了。该剧团资格较老一向在老区出演受欢迎，无形中养成了团员们思想上自高自大，摆老资格的落后作风。这次劳军中部队首长再三要求多演杀敌英雄和报功贺功一类剧时，就暴露了自己的弱点，可怜的很，一点也没有。这时团员们才感到自己所演的剧多不适合战士要求，才感到自己剧目的贫乏可怜这时领导上就抓住这一点，让大家讨论，我们不是一向认为自己很不错吗，为啥今天不能圆满答复部队要求原因在那里呢？从此团员们再不敢摆老资格了，同时学习新剧创作新剧的积极性才高涨起来。
