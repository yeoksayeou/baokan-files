　　The Defenders of World Democracy and Peace – A Survey of Communist Parties Around the World

    Earlier this year, Comrade Lu Dingyi explained the post-war international situation by saying:
    "The victory of the anti-fascist war has opened up avenues for the forward development of democratic forces in various countries. The scale of this forward development of democratic forces is incomparably larger than the forward development of democratic forces after the First World War."
    The scale of the development of world democratic forces can be seen from the development of the Communist Parties in various countries—the leading forces of democratic forces in various countries. The rapid advancement of the Chinese Communist Party's strength and its great contribution to the cause of peace and democracy are visible to all of us. Today, on the birthday of the Chinese Communist Party, we will briefly introduce the situation of fraternal parties in various countries to everyone, from which you can see the growth of the organized strength of the world's people, the strength of the world proletariat, and the inevitable victory of the world democratic revolution.

    Soviet Union
    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has more than six million members and is now leading the Soviet people in the construction of a new five-year plan.

    The Mongolian Communist Party (i.e., the Mongolian People's Party) is the only political party in Outer Mongolia. In 1921, it led the Mongolian people's revolution and established the People's Republic of Outer Mongolia. Prime Minister Marshal Choibalsan is the leader of the party.

The JCP has waged a long and arduous struggle in the country. Because of the relentless destruction of fascism, the number of party members is not large, but it is extremely popular and has a great influence on Japanese politics. Currently, the JCP is the organizer and leader of the Japanese democratic front. The leaders are Kyuichi Tokuda and Susumu Okano.
