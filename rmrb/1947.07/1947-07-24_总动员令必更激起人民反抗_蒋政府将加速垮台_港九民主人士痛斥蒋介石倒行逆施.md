Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd. According to a TASS dispatch from Nanjing on the 21st, the Hong Kong China Business Daily recently published: Democratic figures from all walks of life residing in Hong Kong have denounced Chiang Kai-shek's general mobilization order. General Li Jishen told the newspaper reporter, "In my opinion, the government's (referring to Chiang's petty court) general mobilization order is less a general mobilization to 'suppress the rebellion' and more a general mobilization for suicide. Attempting to mobilize all forces to 'suppress the rebellion' is merely a fantasy. The general mobilization order can be seen as the Chiang government announcing to the people that it does not want peace. This will inevitably force the oppressed people to turn their weapons and fight back against the Chiang government. Dictatorship and corruption are inseparable. After the general mobilization order, the coercive extortion of the people by corrupt officials will be even more cruel, which is bound to provoke popular uprisings. Civil war and destruction are inseparable. The so-called 'realization of economic construction and promotion of agricultural and industrial production' in the general mobilization order is merely a utopia." Deng Chumin, a member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, told the newspaper reporter, "The general mobilization order issued by the dying reactionaries cannot and will not make them stronger than the people. The people will respond to the reactionaries' general mobilization with a general mobilization of revolutionary forces." The writer Huang Yaomian emphasized in his speech, "The general mobilization resolution can only arouse the people to oppose the existing regime and accelerate its demise." Economist Shen Zhiyuan pointed out, "The true meaning of general mobilization is to exhaust all manpower and material resources to carry out its civil war to suppress the people. At the same time, under this order, all peace-loving and democratic groups and individuals will suffer more persecution. Therefore, the so-called general mobilization order is a declaration of war on the people." Other prominent figures, writers, economists, and representatives of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party all expressed the same opinions.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd. According to a Hong Kong dispatch: The Hong Kong and Kowloon branch of the China Association for Promoting Democracy issued a written statement condemning Chiang bandit's general mobilization order, saying: "The Kuomintang government, in order to prolong its dictatorial and forceful unification tyranny, has issued a general mobilization order. This general mobilization order has inflated the civil war apparatus, deprived the people of their lives and property, and plunged the country into an extremely serious crisis. Under the banner of peace and democracy, this association is full of confidence to fight for democracy to the end, to fight against dictatorship to the end, to smash the Kuomintang government's general mobilization plan, to seek true democratic peace. In order to achieve this goal as soon as possible, this association calls on all democrats and groups to unite and work together."

　　总动员令必更激起人民反抗
  　蒋政府将加速垮台
  　港九民主人士痛斥蒋介石倒行逆施
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】据塔斯社南京二十一日电，香港华商报顷刊载：寓港各界民主人士纷纷斥责蒋介石的总动员令。李济琛将军告该报记者称：“政府（按即蒋家小朝廷）的总动员令，就我看来，与其说是‘戡平叛乱’的总动员，毋宁说是自杀的总动员。企图动员一切力量‘戡平叛乱’，只是幻想。总动员令可以看做蒋政府向人民宣布不要和平了，这将无可避免地迫使压战的人民反戈回击，反对蒋政府。独裁与腐败不可分，通过总动员令之后，贪官污吏向人民强制勒索将更残酷，势必激起人民的起义。内战与破坏不可分，总动员令中所谓‘实现经济建设与促进农工生产’，仅为乌托邦而已。”民盟中委邓初民接见该报记者时说：“垂死的反动派所发布的总动员令，不能也将不会使他们比人民更强大，人民将以革命力量的总动员来回答反动派的总动员。”作家黄药眠在其谈话中，强调指出“总动员决议只能激起人民反对现存的政权，而加速其灭亡而已。”经济学家沈志远指出：“总动员之真正意义，在把一切人力物力都搜刮净尽，以进行其镇压人民的内战。同时，在这个命令下，一切爱好和平与民主的团体与个人，将遭受更多的迫害。因此，所谓总动员令，就是对人民宣战。”其他著名人物、作家、经济学家及农工民主党代表，均发表同样的意见。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】据香港讯：民主促进会港九分会发表书面声明，谴责蒋贼总动员令称：“国民党政府苟延其独裁与武力统一的暴政，发布了总动员令。这个总动员令膨胀了内战机构，剥夺了人民生命财产，陷国家于极端严重的危机中。在和平与民主的旗帜下，本会充满信心为民主奋斗到底，为反对独裁奋斗到底，以粉碎国民党政府总动员计划，求得真正的民主和平，为求早日达到眦的，本会号召一切民主人士与团体团结起来共同努力。”
