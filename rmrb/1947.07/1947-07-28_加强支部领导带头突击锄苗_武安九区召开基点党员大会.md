　　Strengthen Branch Leadership and Take the Lead in Crash Hoeing Seedlings
　　The Ninth District of Wu'an Convenes a Grassroots Party Member Congress
　　[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] After the rain on the 13th, all of the Ninth District of Wu'an has been sown, and the seedlings are now four fingers tall. In order to strengthen the Party's organizational leadership in hoeing seedlings, the District Committee convened a general meeting of all Party members in the four key villages of Langkuang, Shidong, Baiguan, and Macun on the 16th. At the meeting, ideological self-criticism was conducted first. It was generally believed that: overthrowing the landlords and achieving liberation is the Party's business, and production is the business of the Production Committee and labor heroes, so we are not responsible if it is not done well. Some people think that we have been working hard for half a year and should take a break! It’s too stressful! After these thoughts were expressed, the leadership immediately seized upon the Party members who played an active role in production, commended them, pointed out the direction, and explained that the Party members' leadership of the masses to achieve liberation was only half the task, and that they must also lead the masses to produce well to be good Party members. Good Party members can take the lead in all kinds of work, not just in one area. Yang Tonglin from Yetao said: "We are good at movements, but not at production! As long as we don't cheat, are fair and just, and unite the masses well, we can do a good job in production. The masses are watching us, and if we can take the lead and set an example, they will follow us. Chen Caide and I will go back and expand our group, and you will see!" Liu San's is an old farmer who does meticulous work, and dislikes others for being rough. This time, he is also determined to bring others along. After ideological unity was achieved, the village branches and the branches, and the Party members and the Party members, launched a competition, each putting forward the slogan of not leaving a single plot of land uncultivated, and not abandoning a single seedling, and doing what they said. It was also stipulated that inspections would be carried out every ten days, and summaries would be made every half month, to see who was superior. According to Zhang Xiuliang of the District Committee, the meeting was very effective. Each village held a mass meeting that same night, and reorganized mutual aid groups based on the principle of absolute voluntariness to rush to hoe the seedlings. This time, the enthusiasm of the masses was very high. According to his estimation, the entire district's seedlings could be hoed for the first time by the 26th. (Yuming)
　　[Jinan Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 26th] In Nancaocang Village, Weixian County, mutual aid groups have hoed weeds four times. Everyone has experienced the benefits of mutual aid and put the surplus labor force into sideline production. Eight mutual aid groups in Nancaocang Village, after rushing to plant, turned to hoeing seedlings. Currently, most of them have hoed four times, and the late seedlings have also been hoed for the first time. Each group also helped two elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed households to hoe weeds and seedlings. After completion, a meeting of group leaders was held to specifically discuss "Is mutual aid good after all?" Pan Zhen's group felt that after mutual aid, everyone was afraid of falling behind, and worked extra hard. His group of eight people hoed and cultivated 70 mu of land in three days, increasing labor efficiency. × Wen said: "Our group has eight people, three of whom participated in the village's land evaluation. When we came, we did the work of eight people. I am almost sixty years old. If it weren't for mutual aid, I would never be able to do that fifteen mu of land! Recently, the group has also drawn surplus labor to do business, and we don't even have to worry about spending money!" Cao Jinyu joined the mutual aid group the latest. Previously, he was afraid of working together, felt awkward, and was afraid of not being able to pay back the work or the grain. During the rush planting, the mutual aid group pulled the seed drill, and he joined. He said: "I have realized the benefits of the mutual aid group. How could I have planted my ten mu of late seedlings and two mu of yams? At first, I was afraid of being awkward in the group, but who knew it was convenient in the group, and the work was done on time without losing work." Now, because mutual aid has increased productivity, the surplus labor force in the village has been put into sideline production. Because of the small amount of capital, the government has provided a special loan of 450,000 yuan to strongly support them. Currently, it has been appropriately allocated according to the specific situation of each group and has begun to be implemented.

　　加强支部领导带头突击锄苗
  　武安九区召开基点党员大会
    【本报讯】十三日落雨后，武安九区全部下种，现小苗已有四指高。区分委会为了加强党在锄苗中的组织领导，于十六日分别在狼矿、石洞、柏管、马村四基点村召开全体党员大会。会上首先进行思想检查，一般认为：闹翻身是党干的事情，生产是生产委员、劳动英雄的事情，搞不好咱不负责任。有的认为，运动了半年了，该休息休息啦！太紧张啦！这些思想谈出来以后，领导上即抓紧在生产中起积极作用的党员，进行表扬，指出方向，说明党员领导群众翻身只是完成一半任务，还要领导群众好好生产，才是一个好党员。好党员是样样工作能带头，不是“单打一”。冶陶杨同林说：“咱们在运动中可以，在生产中就不行啦！只要咱不取巧，公公道道，好好团结群众，就能把生产搞好。群众是看咱的，咱能带头起模范，他们就跟着来啦！我和陈财德回去，就把俺那组扩大，往后瞧！”刘三的是个老干家，做活细致，嫌别人粗糙，这次回去也决心把别人带好。思想闹通后，各村支部和支部、党员和党员即展开竞赛，个个提出不留一分白地，不荒一棵苗的口号，说到办到。并规定十天一检查，半月一总结，到那时看高低。据该区分委张秀亮谈，这次会议收效很大，各村当天夜晚即召开群众会，根据绝对自愿原则，重新组织互助，突击锄苗，这次群众劲头非常大，据他估计，二十六日全区小苗可锄完头遍。（毓明）
    【本报冀南二十六日电】威县南草厂互助锄草达四遍，人人体验到互助好处，把剩余劳力投入副业生产。南草厂村八个互助组，在突击抢种后，即转入锄苗，目前大多锄过四遍，晚苗也锄了头遍。每组还帮老弱孤寡两户锄草锄苗，完成后召开组长会，专门讨论“到底互助起来好不好？”潘珍组感觉到互助后，谁也怕落后，做活格外有劲，他组八个人三天即连锄带耕七十亩地，增加了劳动效率。×文说：“俺组八个人，三个人参加村里评地，俺五个到时，把八个人的活都做了，俺这快六十的人了，要不互助，那十五亩地说啥也做不到这样！最近组里又抽剩余劳力去作买卖，连花销钱也不愁了！”曹金玉参加互助最晚，以前他怕在一块做活，别扭，又怕还不上工出粮食。抢种时，互助组拉耧耩地，他才参加，他说：“我算认识互助组的好处了，我那十亩晚苗和二亩山药，凭啥种上呀？先时，我怕在组蹩扭，谁知在了组倒方便了，到时就把活做完也没亏了工。”现该村互助因增加生产率，把剩余劳力纷纷投入副业生产，资本小，政府特贷款四十五万元，大力扶持他们，目前已按各组具体情况，适当分配，已开始动手。
