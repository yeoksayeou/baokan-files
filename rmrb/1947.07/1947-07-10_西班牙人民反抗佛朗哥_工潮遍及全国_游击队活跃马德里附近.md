　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 7th: Moscow dispatch: Gallego, the Spanish Executive Committee member of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, recently met with a TASS reporter and stated that the guerrilla movement resisting Franco's tyranny in Spain has recently greatly strengthened, and labor strikes demanding improved living conditions have spread throughout the country. It is reported that in the past four months, a total of 330 guerrilla warfare records have been made in Ander, Gahr, and Valencia. The youth guerrilla team named after the Spanish hero Maison, who was killed by the fascists in 1939, is now fighting near Madrid. Young workers are very active in the labor movement. For example, in Sestao, near Bilbao, young workers aged 14 to 17 have been able to independently organize strikes. In some industrial sectors in Madrid, Bilbao, and Catalonia, due to the joint struggle of young workers and adult workers, they have won victories in wage increases and improved food. To protest the arrest of workers for celebrating May Day, 60,000 biscuit workers went on strike, demonstrating great determination and courage.

    【新华社陕北七日电】莫斯科讯：世界民主青年联盟西班牙执委加利哥，日前接见塔斯社记者称：西班牙境内反抗佛朗哥暴政的游击运动，最近已大形增强；而要求改善生活条件的工潮，更遍及全国。据称：过去四个月内，在安德尔、加尔及瓦棱西亚之游击战纪录共达三百三十次。以一九三九年被法西斯击毙的西班牙英雄麦逊命名的青年游击队，现正在马德里附近作战。在工人运动中，青年工人甚为活跃。如在邻近毕尔巴鄂之色斯他鄂，十四至十七岁的少年工人，已能独立组织罢工。在马德里、毕尔巴鄂和加泰隆尼亚的若干工业部门，由于青年工人与成年工人的联合斗争，已取得增资与改善食物的胜利。为抗议因庆祝五一节而逮捕的工人，有六万饼干工人会实行罢工，表现了伟大的坚定与勇气。
