    Shou Zhang Eight Hundred Village Cadres "Contribute Ideas"
    Recognize That Landlords Are Evil
    [Our newspaper's telegram from Jilu豫 (冀魯豫) on the 13th] The first district of Shou Zhang convened a meeting of eight hundred village cadre activists on June 25th. Class consciousness was raised through "contributing ideas." First, landlords were recognized through the study of typical cases, and then cadres' thinking was further improved to clarify their class stance. Under the leadership of District Chief Wu and through mutual influence and enlightenment, everyone deeply examined their thinking and identified the following types of backward thinking that still existed in the progressive thinking of cadres actively serving the masses: (1) Not clearly understanding that landlords are evil and landlords are the enemies of the peasants. For example, one comrade said: "I hate Chiang Kai-shek, I hate secret agents, but I don't hate landlords. I know that secret agents are the enemy, but I don't understand that secret agents are produced by landlords." Another more common thought is that the stance is firm when fighting ordinary landlords, but they can't bear to fight landlords related to themselves, saying: "This landlord is honest." Some were softened and paralyzed by the landlords, such as Zhu Guangshou, who was deceived by Yue Xiuzhi, a landlord on the bridge, who asked him to smoke and drink. He reflected, "If you eat someone else's food, you have to be nice to them and be deceived. I forgot the masses." Some also reflected: "After finding two bottles of rubber oil from the landlord, I thought I was busy all day, and I found seven or eight hundred silver dollars for the masses. What is a bottle of rubber oil?" "The essence of this kind of thinking is not understanding that checking property is returning things to their original owners, but thinking that it is something they did for the masses. This is a 'gift' point of view, which is one of the main ideological roots of embezzling the fruits of the masses." Second, there is a lack of the spirit of serving the masses. Several comrades reflected in this way: "I don't want to be transferred to work in the county because I'm afraid the work will be heavy and troublesome," "No matter what happens, let's take a break and talk about it later." Qu Ling, Rao Guangquan, from the East Subdistrict, said in his "ideological contribution": "I am not democratic in the village, I only engage in land reform individually. When fighting my close neighbor Rao Hebin, I was unwilling to do it myself, and I was unwilling to distribute the one hundred silver dollars fought for by the masses to the masses, and wanted to embezzle them." Wu Zheng Gang from Liang Cheng Zhen contributed his personal "change of heaven thinking." After everyone actively contributed and recognized their own minds, they further improved their class consciousness and enhanced their fighting spirit. At the same time, after the cadres improved their thinking, in order to lead and unite the broad masses of peasants, they more actively contributed the fruits of embezzlement and selling cheaply, and strengthened the unity between cadres and the masses. The conference summary pointed out the future direction, clearly dividing the enemy and ourselves, and uniting the middle peasants to eliminate the landlord class.

    寿张八百村干“献思想”
    认清地主就是罪恶
    【本报冀鲁豫十三日电】寿张一区于六月二十五日召开八百村干积极分子会，经过“献思想”提高了阶级觉悟。首先从典型事例的研究中认清地主，接着进一步提高干部思想，明确阶级立场。在吴区长带头和互相影响启发下大家深刻检查思想，检讨出在干部积极为群众服务的进步思想中，还残存着以下几种类型的落后思想：（一）不明确地主就是罪恶，地主就是农民敌人。如某同志说：“我痛恨蒋介石，痛恨特务，不痛恨地主，知道特务是敌人；不了解特务是地主产生的。”再一种较普遍的思想是斗一般的地主立场稳，对与自己有关的地主便不忍心斗，说：“这个地主老实”。有的被地主软化麻痹了，如朱广受被桥上地主岳修之欺骗，叫他吸烟喝酒，他反省说：“吃人家的嘴短，叫人家迷惑住了，咱忘了群众”。还有的反省出：“查出地主的两瓶胶油，我想整天忙活，给群众查出来七、八百银元，用瓶胶油还算啥”。“这种思想的本质是不了解查财是物归原主，而认为是自己给群众干的，这是一种‘恩赐观点’，是贪污群众果实的主要思想根源之一”。其次，缺乏为群众服务的精神，有几个同志这样反省：“调我到县工作我不愿去，怕工作重了麻烦”，“不管啥事，歇一歇以后再说吧”。东小区曲岭饶广全在献思想中说：“自己在村上不民主，光个人干土地改革，斗个人的近门饶合斌时自己不愿干，群众斗的一百元银元不愿分给群众，想贪污下。”良城镇的吴振刚献出个人的“变天思想”。在大家积极献出和认清自己的脑筋后，进一步提高了阶级觉悟，增强了战斗情绪，同时干部在思想提高后，为着带领与团结广大农民，更主动献出贪污贱卖多占的果实，加强了干群团结。大会总结中指出今后方向，明确划分敌我界线，团结中农消灭地主阶级。
