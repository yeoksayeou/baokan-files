　　The lackey remains the same, but the situation is no longer what it was!
  　Chiang's party suffers a disastrous defeat in the civil war.
  　Wedemeyer will encounter unpleasant realities
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th] According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing: Wedemeyer, after arriving in Nanjing, has been busily engaged with Kuomintang officials all day long. Wedemeyer met with Chiang Kai-shek on the morning of the 23rd, and with Zhang Qun, Wang Shijie, and Chen Cheng in the afternoon. An Associated Press reporter pointed out in a report from Nanjing on the 21st: What Wedemeyer will encounter in China will be extremely unpleasant realities for him. The reporter wrote: When Wedemeyer arrives at Nanjing Military Airport, he will pass the wreckage of Marshall's old transport plane. This new Truman envoy will see little change on the surface from the China he left fifteen months ago. He will meet the same senior officials, talk to the same Chiang Kai-shek and other government officials, and hear the same reports of China's problems. But beneath the surface, Wedemeyer will see that China (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's rule) has suffered significant losses in the civil war. On the economic front, he will find that when he left China, one US dollar was equal to 2,500 legal tender, but now it is worth 40,000 legal tender on the open market. If Wedemeyer or other members of the mission violate the ban that "for health reasons, US troops must not enter any Nanjing restaurants," he will find that Chinese food is ten times more expensive than when he was the commander of the US military in China. Considering the difficulty of hiring servants, perhaps Wedemeyer will not stay in Nanjing for long, but if he does, he will find that the price of rice is 400,000 legal tender per dan, which is also ten times more than before. In military terms, Wedemeyer will find that the CCP army has generally gained the initiative. He will find that tens of thousands of Kuomintang troops are confined within the city walls, while the Communist regular army and guerrillas are fighting freely outside the city. He will find that the restoration of China's main transportation lines (referring to the Chiang army's civil war transportation) is even more distant than last year. He will hear about the growth of Communist military strength from Chiang Kai-shek's worried officials.

　　奴才依旧，形势已非昔比！
  　蒋党内战遭惨重失败
  　魏德迈将遇到使他不愉快的现实
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】据中央社南京电：魏德迈抵南京后，正竟日奔忙于国民党官员间，魏氏于二十三日上午见蒋介石，下午见张群、王世杰、陈诚。美联社记者曾于二十一日自南京发出之报导中指出：魏德迈来华所遇到的，将是对于他极不愉快的现实。该记者写道：当魏德迈抵达南京军用飞机场时，他将驶过马歇尔旧运输机的残骸。这位新杜鲁门特使对他已经离开了十五个月的中国，表面上看来将看不到什么改变，他将遇见同样的高级官员，与同一个蒋介石及其他政府官员会谈，并听到同样的中国问题报告。但在表面底下，魏德迈将看到中国（按指蒋介石统治）受到了内战的重大损失。在经济阵线方面，他将发现在他离华时美金一元等于二千五百元法币，而现在公开市场上却值四万元法币了。如果魏德迈或其他使团团员违犯“为健康故，美军不得进入一切南京饭馆”的禁令，他将发现中国菜价比他当驻华美军司令时贵了十倍。如果考虑到雇用仆人的困难，也许魏德迈不会在南京久住，但如果他久住，他将发现米价每担为四十万元法币，这也比从前增加十倍。在军事方面，魏德迈将发现中共军一般地已获得主动权，他将发现成千成万的国民党部队被关闭在城墙内，而共产党正规军与游击队则在城外自由作战。他将发现中国主要交通线（按指蒋军内战交通）的恢复比去年更为辽远。他将由蒋介石忧愁的官员那里听到共产党军事力量的增长。
