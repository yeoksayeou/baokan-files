　　Exert the Greatest Effort to Increase Grain Production
    ——Re-emphasizing Seizing the Time for Planting, Replanting, and Eliminating Wasteland
    Since spring, our region has experienced a severe drought. Many counties and districts have not received a thorough rain to this day. The first and fifth districts of Taihang, the third district of Jinnan, and some areas of Taiyue and Ji-Lu-Yu (some as a whole, some as villages with varying degrees of severity), although they have demonstrated a tenacious spirit of fighting drought and seizing the time for planting, carrying water for planting and taking advantage of small rains to plant a lot of land, still have a lot of land unplanted. Even the small seedlings that have been planted are not growing well due to lack of rain, and the autumn harvest will be reduced. If the drought continues, it is estimated that nearly five million people in the entire region will suffer from famine. Moreover, many counties and districts have suffered hail disasters one after another. In severe cases, the autumn crops have been completely destroyed, such as in Zuoquan, Pingshun, and Huguan counties. Some villages have almost no hope for the autumn harvest. Although this kind of disaster is not comprehensive, its severity should be noted, and sufficient ideological awareness should be raised. We must broaden our horizons to see the whole picture, and not be misled by the absence of disaster or the lighter severity of the disaster. We must mobilize urgently and exert the greatest effort to increase food production. Planting one more vegetable means one less hungry meal. Any underestimation or slackness will cause greater difficulties in the future.
    Although it is still far from the autumn harvest, we have already entered the hottest period of summer. We hope to seize the opportunity immediately. In areas with severe drought and hail disasters, the leadership should concentrate all its efforts to promote the organization of planting late crops, planting a large amount of buckwheat, red and white radishes, and turnips, etc., to eliminate large areas of wasteland and replant the gaps in the land due to uneven emergence caused by lack of rain. Various places have achieved results in eliminating wasteland, and should continue to carry out effective surprise attacks, calling on heroes to take the lead and Party members to set an example, setting off a larger-scale production upsurge to overcome disasters. In areas with less severe drought, sufficient attention should also be paid to how to increase grain production. We should advocate improving technology and create a high tide of organized production through weeding seedlings. It cannot be denied that in some areas, although farmers' enthusiasm for production has been high after the land reform, the leadership has not devoted enough energy to leading production, coupled with the complacency of the masses, the organization of production has not reached expectations, production experience has not been improved as it should, and the upsurge of production has not been set off. We hope that all localities will pay attention to studying this fact, respond to the call of the Border Government to conduct a production inspection, and carry out vigorous promotion. Xingtai's proposal to launch a merit-making campaign to compare technology and crops is also worth referring to and adopting in various places.

　　努最大一把力增产粮食
    ——再论抢种补种消灭荒地
    自春迄夏，我区旱象严重，不少县区至今未获透雨。太行一、五分区，冀南三分区和太岳、冀鲁豫局部地区（有些是一片、有些是轻重参差的一些村），虽都发扬了抗旱抢种的顽强精神，担水点种与趁小雨抢种了不少土地，但未种土地还剩下不少，即已种上的小苗，也因缺雨，出土后长得不旺，秋收减成；如今后仍旱，估计全区将近有五百万人口遭受灾荒。而不少县区又先后遭受雹灾，严重者秋禾尽毁，如左权、平顺、壶关等县，有些村秋收几告无望。此种灾情虽非全面，但严重程度应引起注意，从思想上作足够的认识，放大眼光看到全面，不因无灾或灾情较轻而迷惑，紧急动员起来，努最大一把力增产民食。多种一棵菜，少挨一顿饥，任何轻视松懈，就会造成今后更大困难。
    目前虽离秋收尚远，但已入大暑，我们希望立即抓紧时机；在旱、雹灾情较重地区，领导上集中一切力量，推动组织种植晚庄稼，大量种荞麦、红白萝卜以及蔓菁等秋菜，把大块白荒地消灭掉，把因缺雨出苗不齐的空隙地补种起来。各地对消灭白荒地曾获成绩，应继续作有效的突击，号召英雄带头，党员起模范，掀起更大规模的战胜灾荒的生产热潮。而在旱情较轻地区，对如何做到增产粮食也应予以足够重视，应提倡提高技术，通过锄苗造成发展组织起来生产的高潮。不容讳言，有些地区，虽经土地改革后农民生产热情高涨的条件下，由于领导上对领导生产放的精力不够大，加上群众自满情绪，生产组织工作未达预期，生产经验并未得到应有提高，生产热潮未曾掀动起来，希望各地注意研究这一事实，响应边府号召进行一次生产检查，进行有力的推动。邢台提出展开比技术、比庄稼的立功运动，也值得各地参考采用。
