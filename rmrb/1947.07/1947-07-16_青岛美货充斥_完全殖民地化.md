Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 10th: Qingdao's "Army and People's Daily" recently revealed that Qingdao's commerce has been completely colonized due to the dumping of American goods. Chiang Kai-shek, in the Sino-American Commercial Treaty, abolished protective tariffs, allowing cheap and high-quality goods from the technologically advanced United States to completely occupy the market of China's nascent national industries. The newspaper stated: "Domestic goods are neither beautiful nor cheap. Shops are deserted, shop assistants are idle, and customers often stick out their tongues and walk away after asking the price. Now, a pair of leather shoes sells for 400,000, a tie for 50,000, and general merchandise such as socks and scissors are all one-third more expensive than American goods. American goods, on the other hand, from army cots and awnings to lighters and calcium carbide, are readily available for eating, wearing, playing, and sleeping, and are both 'beautiful' and cheap. The market is brilliantly lit, the goods are piled up like mountains, and the customers flock like a fair. A can of beef costs over 10,000 yuan, and a pair of pants costs only about 100,000 yuan. The stall owners sell on the spot; some of the deliverymen sell stolen goods, some are 'Sino-American joint ventures,' and some are 'relief supplies.'" The newspaper stated: "The American goods market and the domestic goods companies are in stark contrast. No one shouts the slogan of promoting domestic goods anymore, no one dares to shout it, and moreover, they can't afford to shout it. Commercial prosperity is in the American goods market, while Qingdao's domestic goods shops bear heavy taxes. Aren't these taxes subsidizing foreign exchange? Seeing the economy collapse, one cannot help but worry about it."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: American monopoly capital is actively invading China's northwest petroleum resources. According to a TASS dispatch from Shanghai on the 5th, citing a report from the "News Daily," five American petroleum experts arrived in Lanzhou on July 1st and will go to Qinghai to survey oil fields. These five American petroleum experts, hired by the China Petroleum Company (a Sino-American joint venture) with the support of Chiang Kai-shek's Resources Commission, represent American oil companies such as Mobil, Texaco, and Asiatic Petroleum.

    青岛美货充斥
    完全殖民地化
    【新华社山东十日电】青岛军民日报近透露青岛商业因美货倾销，已完全殖民地化。蒋介石在中美商约中取销了保护关税，遂使工业技术高度发展的美国价廉物美的商品。完全霸占了中国幼稚的民族工业的市场。该报载称：国货物既不美，价又不廉，铺门冷落，店员消闲，顾客一问之后，多吐舌走开。现一双皮鞋要卖到四十万，一条领带五万，袜子、剪刀等等一般商品，无不贵出美货三分之一。而美货则大至行军床、天幕，小至自来火、电石，吃、穿、玩、睡无不物“美”价廉，有“美”皆备。的市场上班驳灿烂，货物如山积，顾客如赶集。一罐牛肉一万多元，一条裤子也只要十来万。坐摊掌柜，现收现卖；送货的有的是现偷现卖，有的是“中美合办”，有的是“救济物资”。该报称：“美货市场与国货公司，成了一个苛刻的对照，提倡国货的口号无人再喊，无人敢喊，而且也喊不起。商业繁荣在美货市场，青岛的国货店铺，却担负了沉重的税捐。这些税捐，还不是贴补了外汇？眼看着经济崩溃下去，实在不能不为之担忧。”
    【新华社陕北六日电】美国独占资本积极侵略我国西北之石油资源。据塔斯社上海五日电引新闻报消息，美国石油专家五人，于七月一日抵达兰州，将赴青海勘查油田。中国石油公司（按系蒋美合办）在蒋介石的资源委员会赞助下所聘请之此五个美国石油专家，系代表美国之美孚、德克萨斯、亚洲等石油公司。
