    Xingtai City Residents' Production and Thrift Campaign
    Chen Guang
    At the end of June, the municipal party committee inspected the citizens' production and thrift campaign that had been going on for more than a month. Under the slogans and guidelines of "Everyone produces, no one is idle," "Produce and conserve, prevent drought and prepare for famine!" "Produce and conserve, build a family and start a business!" "Produce and conserve, support the front lines!" the entire city's residents have launched the production and thrift campaign and have gained the following preliminary experiences:
    First, dispel ideological concerns and establish the idea of ​​production and thrift.
    At the beginning of the campaign, the first obstacle encountered was the ideological concerns of the citizens. The main ideological concerns were: (1) "It is an honor to be poor, afraid that the Eighth Route Army will not love you if you become rich," "Running north and south to do business is not as fast as struggle," "Anyway, the Eighth Route Army will not let people starve to death" and other ideas relying on struggle and the Eighth Route Army. (2) "Enough to eat and drink is enough, if you save too much, you will be struggled against" fear of struggle. (3) "If you earn too much, you can't spend it yourself, and you don't know how many burdens you will have to bear" fear of burdens. After understanding these ideological concerns, the method of free ideological deliberation and discussion was used to raise class consciousness, so as to make it clear that these concerns were incorrect. For example, "The Eighth Route Army loves poor people, it loves poor people who have not yet been liberated. If they are liberated and don't produce, no one will look up to them." "The Communist Party not only allows poor people to be liberated, but also allows them to live a good life after they are liberated." The fear of struggle was resolved through discussion: "Who struggled in the past? Is it right to struggle against those who have been liberated?" And by linking it to the recollection of the emancipation movement, it was clarified that "Class brothers do not struggle, if there are knots, untie them" and "Exploitation and making a fortune is not long-term, starting a family through labor lasts ten thousand years." The fear of burdens was resolved by combining it with typical examples of burdens that had just been borne, such as an emancipated household selling bean sprouts in Wenmiao Street, who earned 140,000 to 150,000 yuan in three months, and only bore 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. From typical examples, the burden under the oppression of the enemy and puppets in the past was also compared. Many people felt that today's burden was too light, and it was made clear that today's burden is to supply the front lines and defend the victory of emancipation.
    On the basis of dispelling concerns, new ideas of production and thrift were established, and the following methods were adopted:
    (1) Recalling the pain of the disaster year in Xingtai City in 1943, many people teared up when they talked about the disaster year, and realized that "In the past disaster years, there was still enemy and puppet oppression of the old wealthy hoarding food, and poor people sold their sons and daughters and starved to death in the streets with no one to ask; this year, the poor have been emancipated under the leadership of Chairman Mao, as long as they produce and conserve, they can overcome the disaster year." Combined with this recollection and understanding, confidence was increased, and everyone came up with ways to produce and conserve.
    (2) "Who did you work for in the past? Who do you work for today?" The chairman of the Shenjiazhuang Farmers' Association said very clearly: In the past, labor was for landlords, capitalists, and corrupt officials, today labor is for ourselves.
    (3) Specifically calculating the possible savings from waste, Zhang Jinluan, a clerk in Shangdong Street, calculated that reducing the three items of cigarettes, tea, and alcohol could save 140,000 yuan in eight months; Xiao Cao and Li Qin reduced cigarettes, alcohol, tea, and pocket money, saving 114,000 yuan a year. After many people calculated, they felt that they had not kept accounts in the past, and did not know how much they spent. After a year of busy work, they had nothing left, because they were wasting money. So they immediately reduced cigarettes, tea, and alcohol, did not spend pocket money, and ate less white flour and replaced it with sorghum, millet, and corn flour; some even added wild vegetables to their diet.
    The solution to the above ideological problems must be closely integrated with leading the production and thrift activities. Those who have done this have been very successful. Simply isolating the solution to ideological problems or dividing them into stages has proven to be unsuccessful.
    Second, leading and organizing the direction and methods of citizens' production.
    More than a month of practice has proven that the direction of citizens' production is one is to develop various handicrafts, such as spinning, weaving, wool spinning, wool weaving, hemp rope making, shoe and quilt making, basket and rake weaving, needlework, mills, oil presses, etc. The other is the transportation and sale of various daily necessities, gradually reducing the transportation and sale of consumables.
    The method of carrying out the campaign is to adopt a combination of universal calls for promotion and breaking through one point to establish a model, discovering production activists, and relying on production activists and cadres to organize production.
    Experience in organizing:
    1. Organizational form: The factory-style "Workers' Production Department" in Nanchang Street has developed from twelve people to twenty-seven people, from making shoes and quilts to making outer shoes, circling shoe soles, splitting firewood, collective living and collective work, capital and labor are converted into shares, joint production is distributed according to shares, and more than thirty women outside workers are united. In two and a half months, 190,000 yuan of capital earned a net profit of 310,000 yuan (excluding food consumption, women outside workers earned 120,000 yuan), under their influence, there are already more than 20 shoe and quilt makers in Nanchang Street (including two converted from cigarette rolling). Roads and streets are small-scale mutual aid joint activities. It has enabled many citizens who "couldn't do anything but watch their empty counters in May" to find a way out for production. Guo Erni in Xiadong Street combined spinning and weaving mutual aid, greatly improving technology and increasing profits. In addition to this, there are many temporary small mutual aid activities for one or several types of business production; there are also families organized, with men carrying burdens to sell and women watching stalls and spinning flowers. In short, it is no more than from small to large, from temporary to long-term, from one type of production mutual aid to several types of production mutual aid, from group activities to joint activities, from the combination of main labor and auxiliary labor, etc. These diverse organizations have improved production and laid the foundation for large-scale organization in the future.
    2. The benefits of organizing: (1) Combining capital, labor, and technology, and combining those with management experience and those without experience, can make the best use of people's talents and make the best use of their financial resources. (2) Overcoming the blindness of production and gradually moving towards planned citizen production. (3) Helping each other and promoting each other, those with technology help those without technology, those who are active in production promote those who are backward, those who are organized unite those who are unorganized. Through mutual assistance and unity, the "intrigue, deception and extortion" in the relationship between urban people is gradually overcome, and further achieve class unity and class love. (4) It is convenient for leadership.
    3. The following issues must be resolved in mutual aid organizations: (1) The issue of converting capital, labor, and technology into shares and distributing dividends. (2) The issue of division of labor, recording work, settling accounts, and paying wages. (3) The system of democratic review and democratic leadership. (4) The exemplary role of cadres in mutual aid. These problems have only been reasonably resolved in a few mutual aid organizations, and further experience in this area needs to be created.

    邢台市民生产节约运动
    陈光
    六月底，市委检查了一个多月以来的市民生产节约运动，全市市民，在“人人生产，个个不闲”，“生产节约，防旱备荒！”“生产节约，兴家立业！”“生产节约，支援前线！”的口号与方针下，生产节约运动已开展起来，并获得如下的初步经验：
    第一、解除思想顾虑，树立生产节约思想。
    运动开始，首先遇到的障碍是市民的思想顾虑，而主要思想顾虑是：（一）“以穷为荣，怕富了八路军不爱”，“南北跑着做买卖，不如斗争来的快”，“反正八路军不让饿死人”等靠斗争靠八路军思想。（二）“够吃够喝就算了，省的东西多了斗争咱”的怕斗争思想。（三）“挣的多了自己也花不成，还不知出多少负担”的怕负担思想。了解这些思想顾虑后，就运用自由思想酝酿讨论的方法，来提高阶级觉悟，使之明确这些顾虑是不对的。如“八路军爱穷人，是爱未翻身的穷人，翻了身不生产谁也看不起”。“共产党不仅让穷人翻身，而且让翻了身过好时光。”解决怕斗争思想是经过讨论：“过去斗争的是谁？翻了身的再斗争对不对？”并联系翻身运动的回忆，明确了“阶级弟兄不斗争，有了疙瘩解疙瘩”和“剥削发财不长远，劳动起家万万年。”解决怕负担思想是结合了当即刚负担过的典型例子，如文庙街一个卖豆芽的翻身户，三个月赚洋十四、五万元，负担仅四五千元。从典型事例中还对比了过去敌伪压榨下的负担，许多人感到今天负担太轻了，并且明确了今天负担是供给前线保卫翻身胜利。
    在解除了顾虑的思想基础上，树立新的生产节约思想，采取了以下的办法：
    （一）回忆民国三十二年邢市过灾年痛苦，许多人讲到过灾荒年都流了泪，并认识了“过去灾荒年还有敌伪压榨老财囤粮，穷人卖儿卖女饿死街前无人问；今年灾年，穷人翻了身，毛主席领导，只要生产节约就能渡过灾荒年。”结合这一回忆与认识，提高信心，大家想出生产节约办法。
    （二）“过去劳动为谁？今天劳动为谁？”申家庄农会主席很明确的说：过去劳动为地主、资本家、贪官污吏，今天劳动为自己。
    （三）具体计算可能节约的浪费，上东街店员张金鸾计算减少烟、茶、酒三项，八个月可节省十四万元；小曹、李勤减少烟、酒、茶及零花，一年可省十一万四千元。许多人计算后，感到过去不算账，不知花多少，忙碌一年一无所余，原来是浪费了，于是立即就减少烟、茶、酒，不花零花钱，少吃白面换成高粱、小米、玉茭面；还有的加吃野菜。
    以上思想问题解决，必须与领导生产节约活动紧密结合起来，这样做的都很成功，单纯把解决思想问题孤立起来或划成阶段，事实证明是不成功的。
    第二、领导与组织市民生产的方向与办法。
    一个多月的实践证明，市民生产方向，一个是发展各种各样的手工业，如纺纱、织布、纺毛、织毛、打麻绳、打鞋被子、编篓编耙、针工、磨坊、油坊等等。另一个是各种各样日用必须品的运销贩卖，逐渐减少消耗品的运销贩卖。
    运动的开展方法，是采取了普遍号召推动与突破一点树立典型相结合的方示，发现了生产积极分子，依靠生产积极分子和干部，组织起来进行生产。
    组织起来的经验：
    一、组织形成：南长街工厂作坊式的“工人生产部”，由十二个人发展到二十七个人，由打鞋被子发展到上外鞋、圈鞋底、批木柴、集体生活集体工作，资本劳力均折股，合力生产按股分红，并团结了周围三十多个妇女外工。两个半月十九万元资本净赚洋三十一万元（吃饭消耗除外，妇女外工赚洋十二万元在外），在他们影响下，南长街已有二十多家打鞋被子的（内有二家是卷烟转成的）。马路和街是小型互助联合活动。使许多“五月晒柜台没办法”的市民找到了生产出路。下东大街郭二妮把纺与织结合互助，大大提高了技术提高了利润。除此而外，还有许多临时的一种或几种营业生产的小互助；还有家庭组织起来，男人挑担贩卖，女人看摊纺花。总之，不外由小而大，由临时到长期，由一种生产互助到几种生产互助，由小组活动到联合活动，由主要劳力结合辅助劳力等。这些多种多样的组织起来，就提高了生产，打下今后大规模组织起来的基础。
    二、组织起来的好处：（一）资本、劳力、技术结合起来，有经营经验的与无经验的结合起来，就可以人尽其才财尽其力。（二）克服生产的盲目性，逐渐走向市民生产计划性。（三）互相帮助，互相推动，有技术的帮助了无技术的，生产积极的推动了落后的，有组织的团结了无组织的，经过互助与团结，逐渐克服了城市人与人关系中的“勾心斗角，欺骗敲诈”，进一步达到阶级团结阶级友爱。（四）便于领导。
    三、互助组织中必须解决以下问题：（一）资本、劳力、技术的折投分红问题。（二）分工、记工、结账、支资问题。（三）民主检讨制度与民主领导问题。（四）干部在互助中之模范作用问题。这些问题只在少数互助组织里得到了合理的解决，有待继续创造这方面的经验。
