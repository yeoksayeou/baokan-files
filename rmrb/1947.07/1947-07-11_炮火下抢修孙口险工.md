When the first peach blossom flood arrived on April 5th, the straw filling under the fifth revetment of the Sunkou hazardous section was eroded by the water, and the revetment surface separated from the dam head and tilted outwards. If it hadn't been urgently repaired, it would have fallen into the water and been washed away by the flood. Later, our engineering team led the laborers to repair it day and night under the fire of Chiang's army, and made a new revetment, so it was not washed away by the flood. After June 5th, the Yellow River water rose more than one meter again, exceeding the peach blossom flood level. By the 15th, the straw filling under the inner revetment of the dam was again eroded by the water, and the revetment surface tilted outward. The 22nd Regiment of the 74th Brigade of Chiang's army bombarded and strafed from the opposite bank. Before emergency repairs could be made, the revetment rope broke, and the revetment surface fell into the water and was swept away by the flood. The engineering team and the people immediately used the stone-dropping method to repair it that night, and two stone-filled gabions were transported to the revetment embankment of the dangerous section on the morning of the 18th. Nearly one million catties of sorghum stalks and more than 1,500 cubic feet of bricks and stones (5,000 catties per cubic foot) donated by the masses were also piled on each revetment. Chiang's army also dug many fortifications along the Yellow River bank on the opposite bank. As soon as they found someone on this side, they would shoot wildly with their guns. The reporter went to the river bank to inspect the flood fighting situation. He saw the engineering team and the people were throwing stones. Since the inside of the fifth revetment was washed away, the fourth dam appeared prominent, and the water under the dam was more than three meters deep. In the dim night, the reporter looked at the river flowing torrentially from the southeast, and it was blocked head-on by this dam, and it emitted a surging sound, turning to the northeast. If this place is not protected, it will break through Sunkou Village, and the flood will directly attack the entire embankment, flooding Shouzhang and Zhangqiu counties. When the reporter walked to the fifth dam, the engineering team and the people were nervously carrying out the stone-dropping operation (stone-filled gabions wrapped with sorghum stalks and ropes were pushed down the dam head). In the tense low voices of "He... Ha", "He... Ha", they pushed down into the water with a burst of energy. Immediately, there was a muffled "Whoosh" sound, and the people who pushed immediately lay down together, and several people whispered urgently: "Lie down quickly, the enemy is going to shoot, someone was shot last night!" As we lay down, four bullets flew over our heads. After lying down for more than ten minutes, the gunfire stopped, and we got up and continued the stone-dropping work.

    炮火下抢修孙口险工
    冀鲁豫分社
    四月五日桃泛初来时，孙口险工的第五道坝的秸料里头埽底下，被水掏空，埽面脱离坝头往外倾，抢修不及将跌入水中，被洪流冲走。后来我工程队率领民夫冒蒋军炮火日夜抢修，重做了个新埽堤，他才没被洪水冲走。六月五日后，黄水又猛涨一公尺多，水位超过桃泛。至十五日，该坝的里头埽底下又被水掏空，埽面往外倾斜，蒋军七十四旅二二团在对岸轰击扫射，抢修不及，埽绳又断，埽面跌入水中，为洪流卷走。工程队及民众于当夜就改用挪砧法抢修，抛下二个挪砧在十八日上午运到该险工堤垣上，近百万斤的秫秸和群众献的一千五百余方砖石（每方五千斤）也堆积在各埽上，蒋军又在对岸黄河沿上挖了许多工事，一发现这边有人，便用枪狂射起来。记者曾到河沿视察抢险情形。看见工程队和民众正在抛石，自第五道坝的里被冲走后，第四坝便显得突出，坝下水深三丈多。在夜色迷茫中，记者遥望河流从东南汹涌流来，被此坝迎头一阻，便发射出澎湃的声音，折向东北流去。如此处不保，便要冲破孙口村，泛水直扑全堤，淹没寿张、张秋二县。记者走至第五道坝时，工程队与民众正紧张进行挪砧，（挪砧是用秫秸和绳裹了石头推下坝头）在人们紧张的低声呼着“呵……哈”“呵……哈”的口号声中，一股劲推下水去，下面随即发出“呼通”的一声闷响，推的人们紧接着一齐伏下了，并有几人低声急传说：“快卧倒，敌人要打枪了，昨夜曾打伤一个人呀！”我们刚卧倒，头上便飞过四声弹流。伏了十多分钟后，枪声断了，又起来继续进行挪砧工作。
